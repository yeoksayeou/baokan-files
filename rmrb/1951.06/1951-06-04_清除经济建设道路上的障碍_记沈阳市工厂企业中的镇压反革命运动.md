Clearing Obstacles on the Road to Economic Construction
     ——A Record of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries in Factories and Enterprises in Shenyang
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    The Shenyang Municipal People's Government arrested a group of counter-revolutionaries on April 26, many of whom were Kuomintang spies and traitorous bullies hidden in factories and enterprises. They wore the guise of technicians, staff, and workers, and specialized in sabotaging the country's economic construction.

    When talking to workers about the crimes of counter-revolutionaries in sabotaging national economic construction and persecuting workers, everyone was extremely angry and full of hatred. A worker named Ma Shaozong from a certain factory used one sentence to illustrate the seriousness of the counter-revolutionaries' sabotage of economic construction. He said, "We break our necks to create production achievements, and counter-revolutionaries can destroy them in two minutes!"

    His words are not at all exaggerated. Not to mention the distant past, on the evening of April 14, Si Ziqing, a counter-revolutionary who infiltrated a factory disguised as a worker, used only a match and a little gasoline to burn down the factory's telephone exchange. This not only caused great losses to state property but also caused many difficulties for the factory in production.

    A visit to the public security exhibition held by the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau will make it even clearer how insidious and vicious the counter-revolutionaries' means of sabotaging national economic construction are, and how regrettable the losses suffered by the state and the people are!

    A rubber factory was burned down by counter-revolutionaries; Wang Lanfang, a Kuomintang spy hidden in a factory, deliberately did not allocate materials according to standards, rendering a considerable number of rubber shoes into waste products. Gao Yuanwei, a Kuomintang colonel staff officer, and Liu Chengqiao, a military officer, infiltrated two units of a factory and seized the positions of engineers. When the factory was producing a new product of major significance to the country's economic construction, the two criminals did everything possible to obstruct and sabotage it, eventually delaying the country's needs.

    What is recorded here is only a part of the exhibition content; and what is recorded in the exhibition room is only a small part of the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries in factories and enterprises. In fact, the counter-revolutionary sabotage crimes are many, many times more than this.

    For example, not long ago, a factory accepted an extremely important task concerning the economic construction of the entire Northeast and the lives of millions of people—repairing an important component on the safety power transmission machine of a power plant. Zhou Rongjia, an assistant engineer of the factory, carefully handed over this component to "technician" Zhang Fengchun and asked him to draw a diagram for repair. After Zhang got the component, he wanted to "dissect" it under the pretext of studying the technology; he was stopped by Zhou Rongjia at the time, because if it was damaged, the power could not be generated for at least a month. At that time, hundreds of thousands of workers would have to stop production. Workers all remember clearly that last year, a factory in Shenyang lost 900 million yuan because the high-voltage line was sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries for only fifteen minutes of power outage; if hundreds of thousands of workers and hundreds of factories could not produce for a month, what a great loss it would cause to the property of the country and the people! And not only that, tens of millions of people will live in darkness because there are no electric lights, especially urban residents, they will not be able to drink tap water, take trams, or even use toilets—precisely because this component is so important, the spies were determined to destroy it. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Fengchun, a spy disguised as a technician, actually cut it into two pieces! When all the employees of the factory heard about it, they were all anxious. Zhou Rongjia was even more anxious and sweating profusely; it could not be welded back together when taken to the factory; later, the head of the technology department personally did it for a whole day and night before it was welded back together.

    The Chinese working class, who have become the masters of the country and enterprises, have carried out a resolute struggle against all the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. When the People's Government made the mistake of "leniency exceeding suppression" in the past in implementing the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the workers kept the sabotage crimes of counter-revolutionaries in mind one by one; many factories also formulated "four prevention covenants" of preventing spies, preventing special agents, preventing fire, and preventing theft, and carried out mass prevention and monitoring of counter-revolutionaries. After the People's Government reversed the deviation and vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, workers in various factories and enterprises immediately launched a vigorous accusation and reporting campaign. In Shenyang, workers in only eighteen factories reported seventy-one counter-revolutionaries in five days. Almost every factory has formulated a patriotic factory protection covenant for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    Workers not only seriously reported counter-revolutionaries but also expressed their love and support for the People's Government with higher production enthusiasm. After the government arrested and brought a group of counter-revolutionaries to justice, new atmospheres appeared in various factories. The paint and coating factory has never been able to carry out production competitions. Whoever actively produces will be attacked by bad elements. Since Zheng Changfeng, a spy who seized the position of deputy director of the factory, was arrested, the entire factory immediately launched a production competition movement and voluntarily dedicated a day of work as a gift to support the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The entire factory guarantees to overfulfill the national production plan by 5% in the second quarter and reduce costs by 3%. After Yang Zhongde, a counter-revolutionary hidden in the eighth workshop of the clothing factory, was arrested, the output of the workshop increased by more than 10% on the same day; on May 12, after a group of counter-revolutionaries were shot in Shenyang, the output of the workshop increased by 40% the next day!

    Under the power and deterrence of the People's Government's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, counter-revolutionaries were panic-stricken and restless. Some confessed and repented to the People's Government, and some threw their guns on the street in an attempt to shirk their guilt. But the remaining counter-revolutionaries did not surrender, and they carried out more insidious revenge and sabotage activities. The fact that Wang Tonglun, a worker in a certain machinery factory, fought bravely alone with two counter-revolutionaries who attempted to burn down the factory's generator on May 10, is a clear example.

    Wang Tonglun's heroic protection of the factory vividly educated all workers: We must be vigilant against the revenge and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries at all times, and we must more actively assist the People's Government in thoroughly eradicating counter-revolutionaries to protect the country's economic construction and protect our increasingly beautiful and happy life.

　　清除经济建设道路上的障碍
     ——记沈阳市工厂企业中的镇压反革命运动
    本报记者  田流
    沈阳市人民政府，于四月二十六日逮捕了一批反革命分子，其中有不少是隐藏在工厂企业里的美蒋特务和工贼恶霸，他们披着技术人员、职员和工人的外衣，专门破坏国家的经济建设。
    同工人们谈起反革命分子破坏国家经济建设和迫害工人的罪行时，人人都愤怒异常，恨之入骨。某厂工人马绍宗，用一句话说明了反革命分子破坏经济建设的严重性，他说：“我们把大脖筋累断了，创造出生产成绩，反革命分子两分钟就可能给破坏了！”
    他的话没有一点夸张。远的不必说，就在四月十四日晚上，披着工人外衣混进某厂的反革命分子司子卿，只用了一根洋火和一点汽油，就把该厂电话交换所烧毁了。这不光使国家财产受到很大损失，更使该厂在生产上遇到许多困难。
    到沈阳市人民政府公安局举办的公安展览会参观一下，就会更清楚地看到：反革命分子破坏国家经济建设的手段是多么阴险毒辣；国家人民财产所遭受的损失，是多么令人痛惜！
    某橡胶厂被反革命分子一把火烧毁了；隐藏在某厂的美蒋特务王兰芳，故意不按标准制配材料，使相当数量的胶鞋全成了废品。蒋匪上校参谋高元巍、军官刘成翘，分别混进某工厂的两个单位，并窃据了工程师的职位。当该厂生产一种对国家的经济建设有主要意义的新产品时，两个罪犯进行了千方百计的阻挠、破坏，终于贻误了国家的需要。
    这里所记录下来的，只是展览内容的一部分；而展览室所记录的，也只是反革命分子在工厂企业中的破坏活动的一小部分。事实上，反革命的破坏罪行，要比这不知多上多少倍。
    譬如，不久以前，某厂接受了一项关乎全东北经济建设、关乎千百万人民生活的极端重要的任务—修理某发电厂安全送电机器上的一个重要机件。该厂助理工程师周荣迦把这个机件慎重地交给“技术员”张凤春，要他画出图样来，以便修理。张拿到这个机件后，借口研究技术，便要“解剖”它；当时就被周荣迦制止了，因为如果把它弄坏了，至少一个月不能发电。那时，几十万工人便不得不停止生产。工人们谁都记得挺清楚，去年沈阳某工厂因为高压线被反革命分子破坏，只停了十五分钟的电，就损失了九亿元；如果几十万工人、成百的工厂，一个月不能生产，那要造成国家人民财产多大的损失啊！还不止此，成千百万的人民也将因为没有电灯而生活在黑暗里，特别是城市居民，他们将喝不上自来水，坐不上电车，甚至连厕所也不能用了——正因为这个机件这样重要，特务分子决心破坏它，转眼不见，披着技术人员外衣的特务分子张凤春竟把它截成了两段！全厂职工听说后，个个焦急万分。周荣迦更急得满头大汗；拿到工厂去焊，总也焊不上；后来技术科长亲自动手，整整一天一夜，才把它焊好了。
    已经成为国家和企业主人的中国工人阶级，同一切反革命分子的破坏行为，进行了坚决的斗争。当人民政府过去在执行镇压反革命政策中，发生“宽大多于镇压”的偏向时，工人们把反革命分子的破坏罪行，一件件地牢记在心里；许多工厂并订了防奸细、防特务、防火、防盗的“四防公约”，对反革命分子进行了群众性的防范和监视。当人民政府扭转偏向、大张旗鼓地镇压反革命以后，各个工厂企业的工人，立时展开了轰轰烈烈的控诉和检举运动。沈阳市仅十八个工厂的工人，在五天中就检举了七十一个反革命分子。差不多每个工厂都订了镇压反革命爱国护厂公约。
    工人们不仅认真检举反革命分子，并以更高的生产热情，来表示对人民政府的热爱与拥护。当政府将一批反革命分子逮捕、法办之后，各个工厂都出现了新气象。油漆涂料厂是从来搞不起来生产竞赛的，谁积极生产谁就受坏分子打击。自窃据副厂长职位的特务分子郑长峰被逮捕之后，全厂立时掀起了生产竞赛运动，并自动献工一天，作为拥护人民政府镇压反革命的献礼。全厂保证第二季度超额完成国家生产计划百分之五，并降低成本百分之三。暗藏在被服一厂第八车间的反革命分子杨忠得被逮捕后，该车间当天产量提高了百分之十以上；五月十二日，沈阳市枪毙了一批反革命分子后，第二天该车间的产量竟提高了百分之四十！
    在人民政府大张旗鼓地镇压反革命的威力震慑下，反革命分子惶恐不安，坐卧不宁。有的向人民政府坦白悔过，有的把枪枝丢在街上，企图脱卸罪责。但残余的反革命分子并没有投降，他们更加阴险地进行着报复破坏活动。五月十日，某机器厂工友王同伦只身与企图烧毁该厂发电机的两个反革命分子英勇搏斗的事实，就是一个显明的例证。
    王同伦英勇护厂的事件，生动地教育了全体工人：必须随时警惕反革命分子的报复破坏活动，要更积极地协助人民政府彻底肃清反革命，以保卫国家的经济建设，保卫自己日益美好的幸福生活。
