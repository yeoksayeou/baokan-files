   Several Specific Regulations of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Strengthening the United Front Work within Government Organs

    In order to further strengthen the united front work within government organs, the following regulations are hereby made based on the suggestions of the First National Secretaries-General Conference on this aspect:

    (I) The report of Secretary-General Li Weihan at the National Secretaries-General Conference on further strengthening the united front work within government organs is approved. People's governments at all levels should organize personnel to study and implement it.

    (II) The united front work within government organs shall be managed by the Secretary-General or Director of the General Office of the People's Government and its departments above the province (city) level. Departments without a Secretary-General or Director of the General Office, and People's Governments below the province (city) level, must designate appropriate personnel to manage it, and may, depending on the specific circumstances, set up full-time or part-time personnel to assist in the work. Heads of People's Governments and departments at all levels must be responsible for leading and assisting.

    (III) The personnel departments of government organs should closely integrate united front work into their personnel management and welfare work.

    (IV) The Secretary-General or Director of the General Office (or the designated responsible person) in government organs may, in conjunction with the responsible personnel of the personnel department, convene regular or irregular symposiums on united front work within the organ, and invite representatives from various parties, non-party persons, and expert technical personnel within the organ to participate, in order to understand the situation, handle problems, and further unite for progress.

    (V) The learning leadership organizations of government organs should pay attention to absorbing a certain number of activists from among the middle and lower-level staff members who are party members and non-party members.

    (VI) People's Governments and departments at all levels should regularly inspect the united front work within the organs, summarize experiences, and promptly handle any problems found, and submit comprehensive reports to the higher levels.
