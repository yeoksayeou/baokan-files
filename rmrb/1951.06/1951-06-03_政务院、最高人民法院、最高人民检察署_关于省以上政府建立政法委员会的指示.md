The Report of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council "On the Situation and Current Tasks of Political and Legal Work" has been approved by the 84th Executive Council meeting of the Government Administration Council on May 11, 1951, and promulgated by order of the Government Administration Council on May 21, 1951. This document provides a preliminary summary of the current great political struggle experience of the broad masses of the people, stipulates several specific implementation work guidelines and tasks for continuing to consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship, and emphasizes the current need to attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of political and legal departments at all levels to ensure the victorious completion of various major tasks. To this end, people's governments at all levels and their subordinate political and legal departments should conscientiously discuss and implement this document, supervise their staff to study it, and overcome any phenomena of neglect of political power construction and political laws and incorrect views existing among the staff. Among them, regarding the provision that people's governments above the provincial level should gradually establish political and legal affairs committees, in view of the heavy tasks of political and legal work in various places, especially the urgent need to organize relevant departments to cooperate in clearing backlog cases and organizing labor reform, people's governments above the provincial (city) and administrative office level, when conditions permit, all have the necessity to quickly establish political and legal affairs committees; the methods for establishing the committee are hereby given the following principles:

　　1. A political and legal affairs committee shall be established within the people's government above the provincial level to be responsible for guiding and coordinating the work of departments such as civil affairs, public security, justice, the People's Procuratorate, the People's Court, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Nationalities Affairs Commission.

　　2. The Political and Legal Affairs Committee is responsible to the Government Committee (Military and Political Committee) or the Administrative Office at its level, and assists the government leaders in managing the research, deliberation, implementation, and mutual relations and internal organizational adjustment, coordination, and unification of the business guidelines and policies of the political and legal departments. In order to carry out its work and without conflicting with the business guidelines and policies of the higher-level organs of the political and legal departments, it may issue resolutions and instructions at any time and review their implementation.

　　3. The organizational structure of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee should be based on the principle of simplification. Generally, staff may be transferred and allocated from the political and legal departments and the prepared quota of staff from people's governments at all levels; in addition to absorbing responsible personnel from the political and legal departments, the members should appropriately absorb responsible persons from relevant people's organizations and local figures; the committee shall have one director and one to three deputy directors, who shall be responsible for presiding over the committee affairs.

　　4. The organizational regulations and the candidates for director, deputy director, and members of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the people's government above the provincial level shall be drafted by the people's government at the corresponding level and reported separately level by level or reported to the Government Administration Council for approval or submitted by the Government Administration Council to the Central People's Government for approval.

　　5. When the administrative offices and county-level people's governments deem it necessary and have the conditions, they may gradually establish joint political and legal affairs offices with the approval of the provincial-level people's government in order to strengthen unified leadership over the political and legal work departments.
