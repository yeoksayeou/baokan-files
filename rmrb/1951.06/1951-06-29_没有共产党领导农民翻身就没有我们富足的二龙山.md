    Without the Communist Party's Leadership in Helping Farmers Overthrow the Old Order, We Would Not Have the Prosperous Erlongshan
    Liaoxi Province Agricultural Labor Model Qi Bao'en
    Whenever I recall my past life, I can't help but feel sorrow and shed tears. My father died when I was three, and my mother dragged us brothers around begging for food. At the age of nine, I went to work for a landlord herding pigs and sheep. From fifteen years old, I started doing heavy labor, and only after the Communist Party came did I finally turn over and gain liberation. When I was twelve, I herded sheep for the landlord Bai Tianhu. I had to go out in the heavy snow without shoes, only able to pick up broken shoes from the landlord's house, my heels covered and my toes exposed, my feet completely frostbitten. At that time, we poor people were not even as good as the landlord's livestock. Once, the landlord's ewe gave birth to a lamb, and I took the lamb to the millstone to warm it. The landlord still said I had frozen the lamb, pinned me down on the millstone, and beat me with a stick, leaving a big hole in my head. Blood flowed all over the millstone, and I fainted on the spot. The scar on my head is still there. I worked for the landlord, and no matter if it was his son or his wife, whoever didn't like the look of me would beat me. The poor fellows working with me saw how pitiful I was and said, "Old Qi, you get beaten like this every day. Can't you just quit?" But in order to earn two *shi* of grain to support my elderly mother, how could I not keep working? Besides, if I didn't work for the landlord, he wouldn't even let us live in the house, and he would drive us out in the dead of winter. Helpless, I could only grit my teeth and keep going. At the age of twenty-five, I did heavy labor for the landlord Zhang Guoling. The village head grabbed me to be a "laborer" to build a mountain road for the Japanese devils. That year when I left, there wasn't a single grain of rice or a single stick of firewood in my house. When I got to the construction site, I ate two acorn flour cornbread and drank a small bowl of thin porridge every day. I was never full, and if I worked even a little slowly, I would get beaten. It was still very cold at that time, and I had no clothes or bedding. At night, I only wrapped myself in a dog skin I had brought with me. I was so cold that I couldn't sleep, so I gathered some firewood to make a fire. The captain saw me and slapped me in the face, making my mouth bleed. That year as a "laborer," I almost lost my life. When I came back from being a "laborer," I still had to do heavy labor.
    The Communist Party came and saved me, and also saved our Erlongshan.
    In the summer of 1947, the People's Liberation Army liberated Shuangliao. The people's savior, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, led us in carrying out land reform, and I was given eight *xiang* and eight *mu* of land. In the spring of 1948, the Party and the People's Government led us to launch a large-scale production movement, calling for mutual aid through exchanging labor. That year, there were only six old and weak horses and three donkeys in our village. I myself exchanged more than twenty *jin* of cotton earned from sideline production for a small red horse that year. Our village jointly prepared four sets of plows and farmed the land well for a year. After a year, there was more grain than we could eat. That year, my family harvested more than thirty *shi* of grain, and in the autumn, we bought a mule and a donkey. In 1949, we harvested thirty-five *shi* of grain, and in 1950, we harvested forty *shi* of grain, with production increasing year by year. In the past, when I worked for the landlord, I worked hard from dawn till dusk, but I couldn't even get enough to eat from the grain I harvested. Now, the sweat drips onto my own land, and the fruits of my labor belong to me! In the past, I lacked food and clothing, but now I can't finish eating the grain I harvest in a year, even in two years. In terms of clothing, the whole family has two sets of fine cloth summer clothes, spring and autumn clothes, and in winter, we each have a set of cotton-padded clothes, first thin and then thick. Not only am I living such a happy life, but all the farmers in our entire Erlongshan are just like me. Our mutual aid team now has eighteen households, and twelve of them suffered like me before liberation. The remaining six households, although they didn't do heavy labor, were poor peasants who spent the whole year looking after the landlord's land. Now, they have all become farmers with enough to eat and wear. In 1948, the whole village had a total of nine head of livestock, but now it has increased to more than thirty.
    Under the Party and government's policies of rewarding production and rewarding mutual aid, I was selected as a first-class agricultural labor model in Liaoxi Province, and our mutual aid team was also selected as a model mutual aid team. The Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department even lent our team a set of new-style horse-drawn farm implements. The Northeast Daily and Liaoxi Daily often published articles praising the Erlongshan mutual aid team. I, who used to be a "pig and sheep herder" who was beaten every other day in the old society, not only became a provincial labor model, but also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in 1949, and was promoted to a member of the Communist Party District Committee of this district in 1950. Not only have I turned over in terms of economics, but my political and social status has also been raised.
    Our old, dilapidated, poor Erlongshan has now become a prosperous village with full granaries and herds of mules and horses. Who gave us this happiness? I know, and all our team members know, that it was given by the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, I, Qi Bao'en, would still be a suffering person doing heavy labor for the landlord. Without the Communist Party's leadership in helping farmers overthrow the old order, there would be no prosperous Erlongshan village. Looking at our land and houses, we cannot forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; looking at our grain and mules and horses, we cannot forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; looking at our new-style farm implements, holding up our bowls, picking up our dry rations, we cannot forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao...
    To commemorate the Party's birthday, I will always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and resolutely complete all the work and tasks called for by the Party. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party, I and my mutual aid team guarantee to do the following things well:
    1. Respond to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, strive to increase production, donate airplanes and cannons, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Our whole team has discussed and decided to donate the increased production beyond the original plan to purchase airplanes and cannons. And we guarantee to take good care of the military families in our team.
    2. To exceed the original increased production plan, we must master scientific technology and eliminate pests and diseases in a timely manner. Our team will buy a sprayer and eight pounds of pesticides this year to prepare for the timely elimination of cotton aphids. In addition, in tending cotton and hemp, we must fully and rationally use female labor to solve the shortage of labor.
    3. Make good use of new-style farm implements. We must give full play to the role and effectiveness of new farm implements in the whole year's production. Our team has a set of Soviet horse-drawn new-style farm implements, one comprehensive model and three combined model cultivators. I and Comrade Yu Lu (Communist Party member) guarantee that we can fully operate and install them. Now we must further teach all team members so that they can master the technology of all new-style farm implements.
    4. Do a good job in the political and cultural study of team members and improve their political awareness. Because the political education of team members in the past was poor, some team members are not very concerned about national affairs. In the future, we must give full play to the role of reading groups and people's schools, and constantly tell the team members about newspapers and propaganda manuals, so as to gradually improve their political awareness. In terms of cultural learning, we have a literacy class, and now the most literate can recognize more than 1,300 characters. During the busy farming season, we will also strive to learn for a while after lunch, especially since I myself know too few characters, and I must work hard in this area in the future.

### 没有共产党领导农民翻身就没有我们富足的二龙山

    没有共产党领导农民翻身就没有我们富足的二龙山
    辽西省农业劳动模范  齐宝恩
    一提起我过去的生活，就禁不住要心酸落泪。我三岁时父亲就死了，母亲拉着我们弟兄要饭。九岁那年，我就去给地主放猪，放羊。十五岁开始扛活，一直到共产党来了以后才翻了身。我十二岁那年给地主白天虎放羊，大雪天出去，连鞋也没有，只得捡地主家的破鞋穿，盖着脚心露着脚指头，满脚都冻烂了。那时咱穷人还不如地主的牲畜。有一次地主家母羊生了羊羔，我把羊羔抱到碾道去烤，地主还说我把羊羔冻坏了，把我按倒在碾台上，一顿棒子，将脑袋打个大窟窿，血流了一碾台，当时就昏过去。到现在脑袋上的疤还在。我给地主家干活，不管他的儿子、老婆，谁看了不顺眼就打。一起做活的穷哥儿们看我实在可怜，就说：“老齐整天这样挨打，不干了不行吗？”可是为了挣两石粮养活老母亲，怎能不干？再说不给地主扛活，地主就连房子都不让住，十冬腊月就撵俺搬家。无奈，也就只好咬牙挺着干下去。二十五岁那年我给地主张国凌家扛大活。屯长抓我去当“劳工”，给日本鬼子修山地的汽车路。那年走时，家里米无一粒，柴无一根。到了工段上，一天吃两个橡籽面窝窝头，喝一小碗稀粥。每天吃不饱，但干活慢一点就得挨打。当时还很冷，我无衣穿，无被盖，晚上睡觉只裹着带来的一张狗皮；冻的睡不着，弄了些柴火烤火，被大队长看见了，一顿嘴巴，打得满嘴淌血。这一年当“劳工”，险些儿送了命。当“劳工”回来还是扛活。
    共产党来了救了我，也救了我们二龙山。
    一九四七年夏季，人民解放军解放了双辽。人民的救星——共产党和毛主席领导我们进行土地改革，我分了八垧零八亩地。一九四八年春，党和人民政府又领导我们开展大生产运动，号召换工互助。那年我们屯上只有六匹老弱不堪的马和三头毛驴子。我自己那年是用跑副业生产赚来的二十多斤棉花，换了一匹小红马。我们屯上合伙插了四付犁杖，好好种了一年地。一年下来，打的粮食就吃不完。那年我家共打有三十来石粮，秋后就买了一匹骡子、一头驴。一九四九年打粮三十五石，一九五○年打粮四十石，生产一年比一年发展。过去我给地主扛活时是起早贪黑给人家干，打的粮食自己吃不上；现在可是汗珠掉到自己的土地上，劳动来的果实归自己了！过去我缺吃少穿，现在一年打的粮食，二年也吃不清。穿的方面，到夏天全家都是两套细布单衣，春秋是夹衣，到冬天先薄后厚的棉衣各有一套。不光是我自己过这样幸福日子，就是我们全二龙山的农民也都和我一样。我们这个互助组现有十八户，翻身前同我一样扛活受苦的就有十二户。剩下的六户虽然不扛活吧，也是一年到头给地主看地边的贫农，现在，都变成吃穿有余的庄稼户了。一九四八年全屯共有九头牲畜，现在增加三十多头了。
    在党和政府的奖励生产奖励互助的政策下，我被选为辽西省一等农业劳动模范，我们的互助组也选成模范互助组。东北农林部还特地贷给我们组一套马拉新式农具。东北日报、辽西日报上常看见表扬二龙山互助组的稿子。我这个在旧社会三天两头挨打的“猪羊倌”，不但当了省的劳动模范，一九四九年还光荣地参加了中国共产党，一九五○年又被提拔为本区中共区委委员。我不但是经济上翻了身，我的政治地位和社会地位也提高了。
    我们过去这个破烂不堪的穷二龙山，现在变成粮食满仓、骡马成群的富足屯。这些幸福是谁给的呢？我知道，我们全体组员们也知道，这是共产党给的。没有共产党，我齐宝恩仍是给地主扛活的受罪人。没有共产党领导农民翻身，就没有我们富足的二龙山屯。看看我们的土地和房屋，忘不了共产党和毛主席；看看我们的粮食和骡马，忘不了共产党和毛主席；看看我们的新式农具，端起饭碗，拿起干粮，忘不了共产党和毛主席……。
    纪念党的生日，我要永远跟着共产党毛主席走，坚决完成党所号召的一切工作和任务。我和我的互助组为了纪念党的三十周年，保证做好下面几件事：
    一、响应抗美援朝总会号召，努力增加生产，捐献飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军。我们全组已商量过，决定把超过原订计划的增产部分捐献出来，购买飞机大炮。并且保证把我组内的军属照顾好。
    二、为超过原订的增产计划，要掌握科学技术，及时消灭病虫害。我组今年买一架喷雾器和八磅农药，准备及时消灭棉蚜虫。另外在侍弄棉花、大麻子上，要充分地合理地使用妇女劳动力，以解决劳动力不足的缺陷。
    三、要使好新式农具。在全年生产中要充分发挥新农具的作用和效能。我们组有一套苏联马拉新式农具，一台综合号及三台联合号铲趟机。我和于禄同志（中共党员）包管能全部操纵和安装。现在要进一步教会全体组员们，都能掌握全部新式农具的技术。
    四、搞好组员们的政治学习和文化学习，提高组员们的政治觉悟。由于过去对组员们的政治教育还差，所以有些组员对国家大事不十分关心。今后要充分发挥读报组、民校的作用，要把报纸和宣传员手册不断地讲给组员们听，以便逐步提高组员的政治觉悟。在文化学习方面，我们有个识字班，现在识字最多的已能认一千三百多个字。农忙时，也争取午饭后学一会，特别是我自己认字太少，今后一定在这方面努力。
