　　We Must Repair the Huai River Well
　　In order to ensure the smooth progress of the Huai River project, the Huai River Management Committee held its first meeting in Bengbu from November 7th to 12th, 1950. Based on the spirit of "joint protection by the three provinces, combining storage and discharge, and mutual cooperation," and in conjunction with the different conditions in various regions, a preliminary plan for the Huai River project and financial plan for the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951 was drafted. The picture shows Director Zeng Shan giving a report on the Huai River project plan at the meeting.

　　The project of blocking and storing floodwater is a key and huge project in the entire Huai River management work. However, before the completion of permanent reservoirs such as the mountain valley reservoirs in Henan and other places, in order to cope with the current flood season and to effectively control floods in the next two or three years so that they do not overflow and cause disasters, the Runheji Lake storage project currently underway in northern Anhui Province is of particular importance. This project is estimated to be able to store more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Since the start of the project, more than half of the entire project has been completed due to the round-the-clock work of 30,000 migrant workers, technicians, and hundreds of cadres and engineering personnel. This is a scene of migrant workers carrying out the construction of the diversion gate dam foundation.

　　The long-term Huai River disasters caused by successive reactionary rulers brought extremely tragic fates to the people on both sides of the Huai River. Look, this is the scene of the old Huai River flood, where many fertile farmlands were destroyed by the flood (left), and many houses were submerged (right). However, after the liberation of the Huai River basin, the era of neglecting the Huai River disaster ended. The People's Government and the Communist Party care about the farmers on both sides of the Huai River, are determined to repair the Huai River well, and are carrying out huge Huai River projects. Now, more than two million of the Huai River management army are fighting to fundamentally control the Huai River. They will change the face of both sides of the Huai River.

　　The construction of the Runheji diversion gate is a technically complex project. The entire gate is made of reinforced concrete. In order to complete the installation before the arrival of the Huai River flood season at the end of June, four generators were installed near the construction site, and 50 kilometers of power lines were erected. At night, thousands of lights are brightly lit, and workers are working day and night on the huge project of the river dam.

　　In the construction of the Huai River sluice gate project, the working class has shown a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and actively supported the farmers along the Huai River. They must help the government complete this plan with the attitude of masters and help more than 10 million farmers in the Huai River flood area get rid of disaster.

　　In the process of managing the Huai River, the migrant workers launched a campaign to make meritorious service. This is the ramming team of the Songtan branch of the Bengbu City West Detachment. In their round-robin mutual aid ramming work, they maintained the record of ramming soil four inches thick into mud blocks 37 centimeters thick, and won the banner of "Lift High, Hit Flat."

　　The Xifei River, one of the main tributaries of the Huai River, has been silted up in the middle and lower reaches since the Yellow River flood, making it difficult for the river water to be discharged. Later, it was backfilled by the Huai River and suffered disasters year after year. The Xifei River was listed as one of the key projects in the spring repair and dredging project. The plan is to abandon the original more than five-kilometer-long curved waterway into the Huai River locked by Gushan, and open a new river channel of 4,350 meters long from Gushan to Jiangzuizi into the Huai River, and build culverts near the entrance to the Huai River to prevent the Huai River from backfilling. The picture shows tens of thousands of migrant workers dredging the Xifei River channel project. (Photo by Liu Dong'ao, News Photography Bureau)

### 一定要把淮河修好（图片）

　　一定要把淮河修好
　　为了保证治淮工程的顺利进行，治淮委员会于一九五○年十一月七日至十二日在蚌埠召开第一次会议，根据“三省共保，蓄泄兼筹、互相配合”的精神，结合各地区不同的情况，初步拟定一九五○年冬和一九五一年春的治淮工程计划与财务计划。图为主任委员曾山在会上作治淮工程计划的报告。
　　拦蓄洪水的工程是整个治淮工作中具有关键性的巨大工程。但是在河南的山谷水库以及其它地方的永久性的水库工程未完成以前，为了应付目前的洪水季节，为了在最近三两年内能够有效地控制洪水，使其不致泛滥成灾。皖北境内正在进行中的润河集湖泊蓄洪工程是有着特殊重要意义的。这个工程估计能蓄拦七十二亿多立方公尺洪水。工程开工以来，由于三万民工、技术工人和数百干部及工程人员的昼夜加工，整个工程的半数以上已经完成。这是民工们正在进行分水闸拦基的施工情形。

　　历代反动统治者造成了长期的淮患，给淮河两岸的人民带来了极其悲惨的命运。看，这是旧日淮河大水灾时的景象，这许多肥沃的良田被洪水冲毁了（左），许多房屋被淹没了（右）。但是，淮河流域解放以后，这种漠视淮患的时代结束了，人民政府和共产党关怀淮河两岸的农民，抱定一定要把淮河修好的决心，进行巨大的淮河工程。现在，二百余万的治淮大军正在为根治淮河而斗争。他们将改变淮河两岸的面貌。
　　修建润河集分水闸是一个技术很繁复的工程。全闸均由钢骨水泥铸造而成。为了争取在六月底淮河汛期到来前安置完竣，工地附近装了四部发电机，架起五十公里长的电线。入夜，万盏灯火辉煌，工人们不分昼夜地进行拦河闸的巨大工程。
　　在进行治淮水闸工程的建造中，工人阶级发挥了高度的爱国热忱，积极支援淮河沿岸的农民。他们一定要以主人翁的态度来帮助政府完成这个计划，帮助淮河泛滥区一千多万农民弟兄摆脱灾难。图为上海江南造船所船体厂的工人们正在试装即将完成之第一扇闸门。（上海江南造船所江南海摄）

　　在治淮的过程中，民工们展开了立功竞赛运动。这是蚌埠城西中队宋滩分队的硪工班，他们在轮番互助的打硪工作中，保持了以四公寸厚的土打成三十七公分厚的泥块的纪录，荣获“举得高，打得平。”的锦旗。
　　淮河主要支流之一——西淝河，自黄泛后，中、下游河床淤塞，河水不易宣泄，后受淮水倒灌，连年成灾。在春修疏濬工程中，西淝河被列为重点之一。计划将原有入淮处被孤山套锁住的五公里余长的弯曲水道舍弃不用，另由孤山至将嘴子开一长达四三五○公尺之新河道入淮，并于入淮附近修建涵闸，防止淮水倒灌。图为成万的民工在疏濬西淝河河道工程。　　（新闻摄影局刘东鳌摄）
