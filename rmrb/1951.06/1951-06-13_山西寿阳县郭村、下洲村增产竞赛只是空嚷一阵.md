　　The Production Increase Competition in Guocun and Xiazhou Village, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, is Just Empty Talk

To the Editor:
    In organizing the patriotic production increase competition, Guocun Village, Third District, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, only put forward the general slogan "See who does it faster, see who does it better," lacking concrete plans and inspections. The masses regarded the competition as "joining in the fun," and it was just empty talk without any practical action.

    Furthermore, the competition in Xiazhou Village, Seventh District, Shouyang County, was launched in a "spiteful" manner. Last year, the village only had seven temporary mutual aid teams. When the spring plowing began this year, the village cadres blindly launched the competition after returning from a meeting in the district. At the meeting, the seven mutual aid teams unanimously demanded that each village cadre lead a mutual aid group and said: "You (referring to the village cadres) teach others to compete, why don't you even participate in a mutual aid group?" As a result, the village cadres organized several mutual aid groups that night, but they did not discuss and formulate competition conditions. The masses criticized this kind of competition, saying: "It started with a loud bang, but ended up very weak."

　　山西寿阳县郭村、下洲村增产竞赛只是空嚷一阵编辑同志：
    山西寿阳县三区郭村在组织爱国增产竞赛中，只笼统提出“看谁做得快，看谁做得好”的口号，缺乏具体计划和检查，群众把竞赛看成“赶热闹”，只是空嚷了一阵，并没有实际行动。
    又寿阳县七区下洲村的竞赛是以“赌气”的方式搞起来的。该村去年只有七个临时变工组。今年春耕开始时，村干部从区上开会回来，就盲目发动竞赛。大会上，七个变工组一致提出，要求每个村干部要带领一个互助组，并说：“你们（指村干部）教别人竞赛，自己为什么连互助组还不参加？”于是，村干部当晚就组织了好几个互助组，但是都没有讨论制定竞赛条件。群众批评这样的竞赛说：“开始喊得凶，结果很稀松。”
