　　Shanghai Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory Should Not Pass Off Inferior Goods as Superior Ones
    The Shanghai Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory previously signed a contract with the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, East China Branch, to dye 3,000 bolts of Youth Mercerized Sea-Chang Indanthrene Blue Cloth. During the dyeing process, the factory disregarded its reputation and mixed in 40 bolts of inferior goods for delivery. After the company discovered this and raised objections, the factory admitted its mistake and offered to price the goods as second-class products. This kind of speculative and opportunistic bad practice is not something that patriotic merchants should engage in. It is hoped that the factory will examine and correct itself, and strive for legitimate profits by improving its business management.

　　上海恒丰染织厂不应拿次货顶好货
    上海恒丰染织厂前曾与中国花纱布公司华东区公司订立合同，代染青年丝光海昌士林性蓝布三千匹。该厂在代染工作中，竟不顾信用，将次货四十匹搀入搭交。经该公司发觉，并提出交涉后，该厂始承认错误，改以二等品作价。这种投机取巧的坏作风，是爱国商人所不应有的。希望该厂检讨改正，从改善经营管理中，争取正当利润。
