Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 14th: TASS Rome, June 14th dispatch: The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" published a commentary on the provincial and municipal council elections held on June 10th.

　　"Unità" wrote: The elections on June 10th, undeniably and clearly demonstrate the trends shown in the two elections on May 27th and June 3rd.

　　In the past week, the Christian Democratic Party made all sorts of frantic efforts to avoid defeat. Their interference in the elections intensified, even resorting to coercion. All radio stations served the Christian Democratic Party, and incidents of fraud and buying and selling of election certificates became more and more frequent.

　　However, the facts proved that all this was useless. According to the Ministry of the Interior's materials, in the provincial council elections on June 10th, the Christian Democratic Party lost 950,000 votes. These nearly one million votes should be added to the more than 1.5 million votes it lost in the previous two elections (May 27th and June 3rd). Thus, the Christian Democratic Party suffered an unprecedented major defeat. It can be asserted that this figure is still lower than the actual figure, because we remember that a large number of votes were invalidated, and the number of votes obtained by each party published by the Ministry of the Interior must have been tampered with to favor the ruling party.

　　In this provincial council election, the left-wing parties won 345 seats, while the Christian Democratic Party, relying on deception, only seized 339 "stolen seats." This is another setback for Gasperi and a new great victory for the people's group.

　　意共团结报评地方选举
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社罗马十四日电：意大利共产党机关报《团结报》就六月十日举行的省、市政委员会选举发表评论。
    《团结报》写道：六月十日的选举，无可辩驳地清楚证明了在五月二十七和六月三日两次选举中所表现的倾向。
    在过去一个星期中，基督教民主党为了避免失败，曾经作了种种疯狂的努力。他们对选举的干涉变本加厉，甚至采取了强制的办法，全部电台都给基督教民主党效劳，舞弊和买卖选举证的事情愈来愈多。
    然而，事实证明，这一切都不中用。根据内政部的材料，在六月十日的省政委员会选举中，基督教民主党丧失了九十五万选票。这将近一百万选票应该和它在上两次（五月二十七日和六月三日）选举中所丧失的一百五十多万票加在一起。这样，基督教民主党就遭到了空前未有的大失败。可以断定，这个数字还是比实际数字低的，因为我们记得有大量选票作废，而且内政部所发表的各党派得票数字还一定是窜改过，使它有利于执政党的。
    在这次省政委员会选举中，左翼党派取得了三百四十五个议席，而基督教民主党靠着欺骗手段才攫取到三百三十九个“偷来的席位”，这是加斯贝利的又一次挫败，是人民集团新的大胜利。
