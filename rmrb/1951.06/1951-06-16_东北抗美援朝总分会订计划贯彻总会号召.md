Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 11th: The Northeast Branch of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, in order to implement the call of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the General Branch on the 5th to formulate a plan for promoting patriotic compacts, donating weapons, and doing a good job in preferential treatment work.

　　The plan emphasized: the three tasks of promoting patriotic compacts, donating airplanes and cannons, and doing a good job in preferential treatment work must be carried out in combination. When formulating or revising existing patriotic compacts, the donation of airplanes and cannons and doing a good job in preferential treatment work must be included as important contents of the patriotic compact. In the widespread establishment of patriotic compacts, promote the realization of donating weapons and doing a good job in preferential treatment work; in carrying out the movement to donate weapons and doing a good job in preferential treatment work, give the patriotic compact a more practical content.

　　Regarding the weapon donation movement, the plan pointed out: it must be combined with the movement to increase production and increase income, and with current tasks. It is necessary to prevent the weapon donation movement from becoming a passive act of taking money out of one's pocket or apportioning expenses, and also to prevent the weapon donation movement from being divorced from current practical work and carried out in isolation. In industrial and mining enterprises, the weapon donation movement should be combined with the promotion of advanced technology, increasing output and quality, reducing costs, and accelerating the turnover of working capital, to further promote the production enthusiasm of workers and technicians, strive to overfulfill the state production plan, and use part of the excess income and the income from one day of work per month to purchase weapons. In rural areas, the weapon donation movement must be combined with the bumper harvest movement and the current summer hoeing work. Through further improving agricultural technology, intensive cultivation, more weeding and harrowing, and increasing sideline income, a portion of the increased production income of farmers in half a year should be donated to purchase weapons. For industrialists, merchants, and financiers, attention should be paid to improving business management, increasing profits, and donating the profits of one or several days each month. Those with sufficient financial resources are welcome to donate airplanes, cannons, or other weapons individually. For the cultural and artistic circles, they should write more manuscripts, paint more paintings, and perform more plays to support the Volunteer Army, and donate part or all of the newly increased income. Only through such proactive measures can the country increase more income, donate a large number of weapons for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and also increase the income of workers, farmers, industrialists, merchants, and financiers, and increase the enthusiasm for production and business operations.

　　The plan requires all parts of Northeast China to quickly convene anti-American and aid-Korea representative conferences from all sectors, industries, factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets, and rural areas to formulate specific measures to increase production and increase income.

　　The plan finally requires local branches to seriously value this great mass political movement and pay attention to strengthening leadership. In propaganda and mobilization work, strive for in-depth and widespread coverage. During the progress of the movement, timely inspection should be carried out, achievements commended, typical cases introduced, and shortcomings overcome. The movement should advance steadily from beginning to end and maintain the full enthusiasm of the masses.

　　东北抗美援朝总分会
　　订计划贯彻总会号召
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北抗美援朝总分会为贯彻中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，曾于五日召开总分会常委扩大会议，拟订关于推行爱国公约、捐献武器和做好优抚工作的计划。
    该计划强调指出：推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和做好优抚工作等三项任务，必须结合进行。在订立或增订原有的爱国公约时，必须把捐献飞机大炮和做好优抚工作作为爱国公约的重要内容之一。在普遍订立爱国公约中，推动捐献武器和做好优抚工作的实现；在开展捐献武器和做好优抚工作运动中，使爱国公约具有更实际的内容。
    关于捐献武器运动，计划中指出：必须和增加生产、增加收入运动结合进行，与当前各项工作结合进行，既须防止把捐献武器运动变成消极的掏腰包或摊派，又须防止把捐献武器运动脱离当前各项实际工作，孤立地进行。在工矿企业里，捐献武器运动应与推广先进技术、提高产量质量、降低成本、加速流动资金周转等工作结合起来，进一步发扬工人群众和技术人员的生产积极性，争取超额完成国家生产计划，把超额所得的一部分，和每月献工一天的所得，作为购买武器的捐款。在农村中，捐献武器运动必须与丰产运动和目前夏锄工作结合进行，从进一步改进农业技术，精耕细作，多铲多?，增加副业收入中，以农民半年增产所得的一部分，捐献出来，购买武器。对工商金融业者，应注意改善经营管理，增加赢余，每月以一天或数天的盈利捐献出来，并欢迎其有足够资力者单独捐献飞机、大炮或其他武器。对文化艺术界，应为支援志愿军而多写稿、多画画、多演戏，捐献新增加的收入的一部或全部。只有这种积极的做法，才能一方面为国家增加更多的收入，为人民志愿军捐献大批的武器，同时也增加了工人、农民和工商金融业者的收入，提高了生产和经营营业的积极性。
    该计划要求东北各地迅速召开各界、各行业、工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道和农村的抗美援朝代表会议，拟定增加生产增加收入的具体办法。
    该计划最后要求各地分会认真重视这个伟大的群众政治运动，并注意加强领导。在宣传动员工作中，力求深入普遍。在运动进展过程中，应及时检查，表扬成绩，介绍典型，克服缺点。要使运动自始至终稳步前进，并保持群众的饱满情绪。
