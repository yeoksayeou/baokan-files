            Section Four: Sentence Components

    Subject. We already know that a general sentence has two parts: subject and predicate. However, some sentences do not have a subject, especially clauses in compound sentences. For example:
    (1) The masses shook their heads when they saw it, how could they bear to watch it any further? (Mao)
    (2) But later, "foreign stereotyped writing" and "foreign dogma" emerged. (Mao)
    What forms can serve as the subject of a sentence? Nouns and pronouns are the most common, but verbs and adjectives can also be used. Phrases and sentence forms are also often used as subjects. For example:
    (3) Noun: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher. (Mao)
    (4) Pronoun: We must learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. (Mao)
    (5) Adjective: Slow is good, but don't be too slow.
    (6) Verb: Not understanding is not understanding, don't pretend to understand. (Mao)
    (7) Subject-object phrase: Sitting on the fence is not acceptable. (Mao)
    (8) Subject-predicate phrase: The liberation of the Chinese people alarmed American imperialism.
    (9) Sentence form: Who leads whom is an important question.
    These words and phrases can all be accompanied by some modifiers; there is no need to provide detailed examples.
    The subject is usually placed before the predicate, but it can also be placed after the predicate. For example:
    (10) Later, many more people came.
    (11) The presidium is sitting on the stage.
    Types of Predicates. The predicate of a Chinese sentence does not necessarily have a verb, which is different from most Western European languages. The main component of a predicate can be a verb, a noun, or an adjective. For example:
    (12) Verb: We rely on the power of the people.
    (13) Noun: Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
    (14) Adjective: That would be too dangerous. The first type of sentence is the most common and also the most versatile. The second type of sentence was also very common in ancient times, but in modern times, the word "是" ("is") is added between the subject and the noun predicate, with only a few exceptions. "是" ("is") is a verb, so this type of sentence is close in form to the first type. The third type of sentence is still common, but the addition of "是……的" ("is... of") is gradually increasing, such as "那是危险的" ("That is dangerous"), which is actually equivalent to "那是危险的事情" ("That is a dangerous thing"). This is the same as the second type, which is also close to the first type.
    Because the main components of most sentences are either verbs or adjectives, we sometimes refer to the subject of a sentence as the subject of a certain verb or adjective, for example, saying that "we" is the subject of "rely."
    Object. In the sentence "我们依靠人民的力量" ("We rely on the power of the people"), "力量" ("power") is governed by "依靠" ("rely"), and we say that it is the object of the verb "依靠" ("rely"). Only verbs (including deverbal verbs) can have objects, and not every verb has an object. Generally speaking, verbs that have objects are said to be transitive; those that do not have objects are said to be intransitive. However, a transitive verb does not always have an object following it. For example, "写" ("write") is inherently transitive, but in the sentence "大家来写" ("Everyone come and write"), it does not take an object. Conversely, verbs that are usually intransitive can sometimes take an object, such as "坐车" ("take a car") and "站岗" ("stand guard").
    What forms can serve as the object of a verb? Like the subject, nouns and pronouns are the most common, but other forms are also possible.
    (15) Noun: They understand dialectics.
    (16) Pronoun: I went; didn't see him.
    (17) Adjective: Not afraid of heat, only afraid of cold.
    (18) Verb: Landlords are afraid of struggle.
    (19) Subject-object phrase: Intellectuals have not learned how to cook.
    (20) Subject-predicate phrase: Imperialists also waited for their defeat. (Mao)
    (21) Sentence form: But people all over the world saw their success.
    The object is usually placed after the verb, but there are also times when it is placed before the verb.
    (22) He doesn't understand anything, and he still refuses to learn.
    (23) His brother is different from him; he wants to learn this and that. It can even be placed before the subject. For example:
    (24) This issue, we still need to study carefully.
    (25) Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills.
    Two Objects. A verb sometimes has two objects, generally one referring to a person and the other referring to a thing. For example:
    (26) They taught us a good method.
    (27) Give them land, give them work, let them reform themselves through labor. (Mao)
    Active and Passive. In general, the subject represents the actor, and the object represents the receiver of the action. When the actor does not appear, the receiver can still be the object, such as "Later, 'foreign stereotyped writing' and 'foreign dogma' emerged." But sometimes, the person or thing receiving the action becomes the subject, for example:
    (28) Everything else has been tried and failed. (Mao)
    (29) When this work is done well, other work can begin.
    Sometimes we add the word "被" ("bei," indicating passive voice) before the verb, for example:
    (30) Because his height was not up to standard, he was not admitted.
    But this is not universally necessary. On the contrary, most sentences do not need to add the word "被" ("bei"), and this sentence can also be said as "没有录取" ("was not admitted"); it is even impossible to add "被" ("bei"), for example, in the previous two sentences, no one would ever say "一切别的东西都被试过了" ("Everything else has been tried by 'bei'") and "这个工作被做好了，别的工作才能被着手" ("This work was done well by 'bei', then other work can begin by 'bei'").
    Predicate Complement. The component after the word "是" ("shi," is) is called the predicate complement. Verbs with meanings similar to "是" ("shi"), such as "变成" ("become") and the classical Chinese "为" ("wei," be), also have predicate complements following them. Without the word "是" ("shi"), directly using a noun or adjective as the predicate is also called a predicate complement.
    There are two types of predicate complements. One type is nominal, but not limited to nouns. For example:
    (31) Noun: Studying literature is one thing, writing articles is another. (Lu Xun)
    (32) Pronoun: Who are you?
    (33) Adjective: This is not honesty, this is stupidity. (Different from "他不老实" ("He is not honest") and "他糊涂" ("He is stupid").)
    (34) Verb: Not understanding is not understanding.
    (35) Subject-object phrase: Children often give me good lessons, one of which is learning to talk. (Lu Xun)
    (36) Subject-predicate phrase: The ultimate goal is the elimination of classes, the elimination of state power, and the elimination of the party. (Mao)
    (37) Sentence form: The result is the complete collapse of the reactionaries and the expulsion of imperialism from China.
    The other type of predicate complement is adjectival. There has already been an example of only an adjective without the word "是" ("shi") (14). With the word "是" ("shi"), there is generally the word "的" ("de," a particle indicating attribution) below. Between "是" ("shi") and "的" ("de"), there can also be nouns, pronouns, etc., even sentence forms. Anything that can be used as a modifier for a noun can also be used as a predicate complement. Modifiers will be discussed below, so examples will not be given here to avoid repetition. However, when the word "是" ("shi") is not used, there is not necessarily only an adjective below; it can also be a subordinate phrase or a sentence form:
    (38) These people are glib-tongued; ignore them. (Two subordinate phrases)
    (39) China is vast and abundant, with a large population. (Three sentence forms)
    (40) The reeds on the wall have a heavy head, light feet, and shallow roots; the bamboo shoots in the mountains have a sharp mouth, thick skin, and an empty belly. (Each of the two clauses has three sentence forms) This is worth noting.
    Complex Predicates. A predicate that contains two or more verbs (including their objects and modifiers) is complex. At this time, we must first distinguish whether these verbs belong to the same subject. In this way, complex predicates are clearly divided into two types.
    If several verbs belong to the same subject, it is often possible to distinguish between major and minor verbs; one is the main verb, and the others are secondary. The verbs underlined in the following examples are the main verbs, and the circled verbs are the secondary verbs.
    (41) Many people hold golden bowls begging for food.
    (42) To analyze China's actual problems deeply and scientifically using the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism. (Mao)
    (43) We can fully rely on the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship to unite all the people in the country except the reactionaries and steadily reach our destination. (Mao) At this time, we can say that those secondary verbs, along with their objects and modifiers, are modifiers of that main verb.
    Sometimes, it is not easy to distinguish between the main and secondary verbs of several verbs with the same subject, for example:
    (44) Take it up again and look at it, but still can't tell what it is.
    (45) Everyone applauds to welcome. In sentence (44), "拿" ("take") and "看" ("look") are just two actions, one after the other, and it is difficult to determine which is more important. In sentence (45), it can be said that "鼓掌" ("applaud") expresses the manner of "欢迎" ("welcome"), or it can be said that "欢迎" ("welcome") expresses the intention of "鼓掌" ("applaud"), and it is difficult to determine which is the main verb. When encountering this situation, there is no need to distinguish between major and minor verbs. (There are also several verbs that are joined in parallel, which will be discussed later when talking about joined components.)
    In this type of predicate, there is a special form, which is the form with the word "把" ("ba," indicating disposal), for example:
    (46) Some comrades are "shooting arrows without a target," firing randomly, and such people can easily ruin the revolution. (Mao) Here, the object of "把" ("ba") is "革命" ("revolution"), and the object of "弄坏" ("ruin") is also "革命" ("revolution") (according to the original meaning of "把" ("ba"), it means: take up the revolution and ruin it), so we treat "把" ("ba") as a special auxiliary verb, saying that it can move the object of the main verb to the front. In this way, "把革命弄坏" ("ruin the revolution") is considered a simple predicate and not a complex predicate.
    Another type of complex predicate is where the subject of the second verb is the object of the first verb. The underlined verbs below are those where the object doubles as the subject.
    (47) Children often like to listen to people chat. (Lu Xun)
    (48) If they are unwilling to work, the people's country will force them to work. (Mao)
    In this type of predicate, there is also a special form, which is the form with the word "被" ("bei," indicating passive voice), for example:
    (49) He has already been persuaded by everyone. Here, "大家" ("everyone") is the object of "被" ("bei") and also the subject of "说服" ("persuade"), which is the same as the previous three sentences; but who is being persuaded? The notional (not formal) object of "说服" ("persuade") is "他" ("he"), which is also the subject of "被" ("bei"). Therefore, we treat "被" ("bei") as a special auxiliary verb, saying that its function is to introduce the actor in a sentence where the receiver of the action is the subject, and that "被大家" ("by everyone") is an additional phrase. In this way, "说服" ("persuade") becomes the main verb. In addition to the word "被" ("bei"), we also use "叫" ("jiao," call) and "让" ("rang," let). For other verbs, even if their meaning is similar to "被" ("bei"), we still recognize them as the main verbs, such as "遭受" ("suffer") in "朝鲜许多城市遭受美国飞机轰炸" ("Many cities in Korea suffered from American aircraft bombing").
    The above two types of predicates are often combined, for example:
    (50) Cultural and educational workers in various regions must use forms that can be accepted by the broad masses of workers and peasants to help them learn culture.
    (51) We must also encourage workers, peasants, and soldiers to use all existing conveniences to improve their cultural level. In (50), "利用" ("use") and "帮助" ("help") belong to the same subject (the latter is the main verb), and the object of "帮助" ("help"), "them," is also the subject of "学习" ("learn"). In (51), the object of "鼓励" ("encourage"), "workers, peasants, and soldiers," is also the subject of "利用" ("use") and "提高" ("improve"), and among the latter two verbs, "提高" ("improve") is the main one.
                                        (End of this section, full text not finished)

　　语法、修辞讲话
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
            第四段  句子的成分
    主语。我们已经知道，一般的句子都有主语和谓语两个部分。可是有些句子是没有主语的，尤其是复合句里的分句。例如：
    （一）群众见了就摇头，哪里还肯看下去呢？（毛）
    （二）但到后来就产生了洋八股、洋教条。（毛）
    有哪些格式能做句子的主语呢？名词和代词最普通，动词和形容词也都可以。短语和句子形式也常常用来做主语。例如：
    （三）名词：联共就是我们的最好的先生。（毛）
    （四）代词：我们必须向联共学习。（毛）
    （五）形容词：慢是好的，可不要太慢。
    （六）动词：不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。（毛）
    （七）动宾短语：骑墙是不行的。（毛）
    （八）主谓短语：中国人民的解放使美帝国主义恐慌起来。
    （九）句子形式：谁领导谁是一个重要的问题。
    这些词和短语都可以带上些附加语，不必细细举例。
    主语通常在谓语前头，但是也有在谓语后头的。例如：
    （十）后来又来了许多人。
    （十一）台上坐着主席团。
    谓语的类型。汉语句子的谓语不一定要有一个动词，这是和一般西欧语言不同的。谓语的主要成分可能是一个动词，也可能是一个名词或是一个形容词。例如：
    （十二）动词：我们依靠人民的力量。
    （十三）名词：今天端午。
    （十四）形容词：那可太危险。第一类句子最普通，也最富于变化。第二类句子在古代也是很普通的，但是近代都在主语和名词谓语之间加上个“是”字，只有少数例外。“是”字是动词，所以这类句子跟第一类的形式接近了。第三类句子还常见，但是加上“是……的”的也逐渐多起来了，如“那是危险的，”实际上等于“那是危险的事情。”这就跟第二类相同，也就接近了第一类的形式。
    因为大多数句子的主要成分不是动词就是形容词，所以我们有时候也把一句的主语说成某一个动词或形容词的主语，比如说“我们”是“倚靠”的主语。
    宾语。在“我们倚靠人民的力量”这个句子里，“力量”是被“倚靠”管着的，我们说它是动词“倚靠”的宾语。只有动词（包括副动词）才能有宾语，而且未必个个动词都有宾语。一般地说，有宾语的动词，我们说它是及物的；没有宾语的，我们说它是不及物的。但是及物的动词不一定老跟着一个宾语，比如“写”本质上是及物的，在“大家来写”这一句里就没有带宾语。跟这个相反，平常不及物的动词有时候也能带个宾语，例如“坐车”和“站岗”。
    有哪些格式能做动词的宾语呢？跟主语一样，名词和代词最普通，别的格式也都有。
    （十五）名词：他们懂得辩证法。
    （十六）代词：我去过了；没见着他。
    （十七）形容词：不怕热，只怕冷。
    （十八）动词：地主怕斗争。
    （十九）动宾短语：知识分子没学过煮饭做菜。
    （二十）主谓短语：帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败。（毛）
    （二一）句子形式：可是全世界的人都看见他们成功了。
    宾语通常放在动词的后头，但是也有放在动词前头的时候。
    （二二）他什么都不懂，还不肯学习。
    （二三）他兄弟跟他不一样，这个也要学习，那个也要学习。甚而至于有放在主语前头的。例如：
    （二四）这个问题，我们还要仔细研究。
    （二五）戏法人人会变，各有巧妙不同。
    两个宾语。一个动词有时候会有两个宾语，大率是一个指人，一个指物。例如：
    （二六）他们教了我们一个好方法。
    （二七）给他们土地，给他们工作，让他们在劳动中改造自己。（毛）
    主动和被动。一般的情形，主语代表主动者，宾语代表被动者。在主动者不出现的时候，被动者可以仍旧做宾语，如“后来就产生了洋八股、洋教条。”可是也有时候，这个被动的人或物成了主语，例如：
    （二八）一切别的东西都试过了，都失败了。（毛）
    （二九）这个工作做好了，别的工作才能着手。
    有时候我们在动词前面加个“被”字，例如：
    （三十）因为身高不够标准，没有被录取。（期）
    但是这不是普遍地必要的。相反，大多数句子不需要加“被”字，象这一句也可以说“没有录取”；甚而至于加不上“被”字，例如前面两句，决没有人说“一切别的东西都被试过了”和“这个工作被做好了，别的工作才能被着手”。
    表语。“是”字后面的成分，我们管它叫表语。意思和“是”相近的动词，象“变成”和文言的“为”，后面的成分也是表语。不用“是”字，直接用名词或形容词做谓语，也叫它表语。
    表语有两类。一类是名词性的，但不限于名词。例如：
    （三一）名词：研究文学是一件事，做文章又是一件事。（鲁）
    （三二）代词：你是谁？
    （三三）形容词：这不是老实，这是糊涂。（和“他不老实”“他糊涂”不同。）
    （三四）动词：不懂就是不懂。
    （三五）动宾短语：孩子们常常给我好教训，其一是学话。（鲁）
    （三六）主谓短语：最终的目的是阶级的消灭，国家的权力的消灭和党的消灭。（毛）
    （三七）句子形式：结果是反动派完全崩溃，帝国主义被驱逐出中国。
    另一类表语是形容词性的。没有“是”字只有形容词的例子已经有过（十四）。有了“是”字，大率下面有“的”字。“是”和“的”的中间也可以有名词、代词等等，以至于句子形式，凡是能用做名词的附加语的，也都能用做表语。底下要讲附加语，这里就不举例，免得重复。可是不用“是”字的时候，底下也不一定只是一个形容词，也可能是一个主从短语或是句子形式：
    （三八）这些人贫嘴薄舌，别理他们。（两个主从短语）
    （三九）中国地大物博，人口多。（三个句子形式）
    （四十）墙上芦苇，头重脚轻根底浅；山间竹笋，嘴尖皮厚腹中空。（两个分句里各有三个句子形式）这是值得注意的。
    复杂的谓语。一个谓语里包含两个或更多的动词（包括它的宾语和附加语），这个谓语就复杂了。这个时候，我们首先要辨别这些动词是不是属于同一主语。这样，复杂的谓语就显然分成两个类型。
    几个动词属于同一主语，常常能分得出轻重，一个是主要的，别的是次要的。底下例句里加点的是主要的动词，加圈的是次要的。
    （四一）许多人捧着金碗讨饭。
    （四二）应用马列主义的观点和方法去深刻地、科学地分析中国的实际问题。（毛）
    （四三）我们完全可以依靠人民民主专政这个武器，团结全国除了反动派以外的一切人，稳步地走到目的地。（毛）这个时候，我们可以说那些次要的动词，连同它的宾语和附加语，是那个主要动词的附加语。
    有时候，同一主语的几个动词不容易分别主要和次要，例如：
    （四四）再拿起来看看，还是看不出是什么。
    （四五）大家鼓掌欢迎。（四四）句里，“拿”和“看”只是一先一后的两个动作，难决定哪一个重要些。（四五）句里，可以说“鼓掌”表示“欢迎”的方式，也可以说“欢迎”表示“鼓掌”的用意，难决定哪一个是主要的动词。遇到这种情形，就不必去分别主要和次要。（还有几个动词平行联合的，底下讲联合成分的时候再说。）
    在这一个类型的谓语里，有一个特殊的格式，就是用“把”字的格式，例如：
    （四六）有些同志却在那里“无的放矢”，乱放一通，这样的人就容易把革命弄坏。（毛）这里，“把”的宾语是“革命”，“弄坏”的宾语也是“革命”（要照“把”字原来的意思讲，就是：拿起革命来，弄坏它），所以我们把“把”字作为一个特殊的副动词，说它能把主要动词的宾语提到前头去。这样，“把革命弄坏”就算是一个简单的谓语，不算是复杂的谓语。
    另一个类型的复杂谓语是第二个动词的主语就是第一个动词的宾语。底下加点的就是这种宾语兼主语。
    （四七）小孩子往往喜欢听人谈天。（鲁）
    （四八）他们如果不愿意劳动，人民的国家就要强迫他们劳动。（毛）
    在这一个类型的谓语里，也有一个特殊的格式，就是用“被”字的格式，例如：
    （四九）他已经被大家说服了。这里，“大家”是“被”的宾语，又是“说服”的主语，这是和前面三句相同的；但是说服谁呢？“说服”的意念上的（不是形式上的）宾语是“他”，也就是“被”的主语。因此，我们把“被”字作为一个特殊的副动词，说它的作用是在被动者做主语的句子里引进主动者，说“被大家”是一个附加的短语。这样，“说服”就成了主要的动词了。除“被”字以外，我们还用“叫”和“让”。此外的动词，尽管意思和“被”相近，我们还是承认它是主要的动词，如“朝鲜许多城市遭受美国飞机轰炸”里的“遭受”。
    以上两个类型的谓语又常常套在一起，例如：
    （五○）各地的文教工作者必须利用工农大众所能接受的形式去帮助他们学习文化。
    （五一）我们也必须鼓励工农兵利用一切现有的方便提高自己的文化水平。在（五○）里，“利用”和“帮助”属于同一主语（后者是主要的动词），而“帮助”的宾语“他们”同时是“学习”的主语。在（五一）里，“鼓励”的宾语“工农兵”同时是“利用”和“提高”的主语，而后面这两个动词之中又以“提高”为主要的一个。
                                        （本段完，全文未完）
