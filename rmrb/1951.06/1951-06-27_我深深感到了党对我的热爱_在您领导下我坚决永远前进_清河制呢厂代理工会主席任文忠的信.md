Respected Chairman Mao:
	The 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching. On this great holiday, when I think about the past and look at the present, my heart is filled with infinite excitement!
	I was a miserable person in the old society. I worked as a small worker and an apprentice from a young age. At the age of nineteen, I entered the Qinghe Woolen Mill, where my monthly salary was only six yuan. I endured the inhuman life of not having enough to eat or wear, and patiently learned the technology. I learned to drive in a year and a half, and learned to repair in three years. I thought that if I learned the technology, life would be better; but for twenty years, I was exploited and oppressed, and my life did not improve in the slightest. Chairman Mao! If it weren't for your leadership, how could the working people have turned themselves around? How could I have turned myself around? Under your wise leadership, the Communist Party liberated all of China and liberated me as well. The political status of workers has been raised, and my life has been guaranteed. In December 1949, I participated in the celebration of Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday. At the meeting, I saw Commander-in-Chief Zhu and shook hands with him. The Party treats us like its own children; I deeply felt the Party's concern and love for us. In the past two years, under the Party's cultivation and education, my awareness has gradually increased, and I have been actively working hard in production and work. In 1949, I was elected as a member of the trade union. In July 1950, the trade union was re-elected, and I was re-elected again. In mid-July, I gloriously participated in the National Textile Workers' Congress. In the 100,000-yard woolen cloth competition, I was rated as a work model. In November, our factory carried out democratic reform, and I was promoted to be the director of the weaving workshop; now I am working as the acting chairman of the trade union. Under your leadership, after thirty years of arduous struggle, we have achieved today's victory, and the working class has turned over and become the masters. Respected Chairman Mao! Under your wise leadership, I will resolutely advance forever! I guarantee to take the lead in all aspects of work. I am not afraid of any difficulties and will definitely overcome them! I guarantee to do a good job in the trade union work and complete and exceed the production tasks assigned to us by the state.
	Now we are launching a campaign to donate airplanes and artillery to support the Volunteer Army in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The trade union plans to mobilize and organize all employees of the factory to increase production and donate an airplane.
	I wish you good health.
	Worker of Qinghe Woolen Mill, Ren Wenzhong

　　我深深感到了党对我的热爱  在您领导下我坚决永远前进
    ——清河制呢厂代理工会主席任文忠的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的三十周年就要来到了。在这伟大的节日，我想想过去，看看现在，心中真是无限兴奋！
    我是旧社会的苦人。从小作小工，当学徒。十九岁进了清河制呢厂，每月工资才六块钱。我忍受着吃不饱穿不暖的非人生活，耐心学习技术，一年半学会开车，三年学会了修理。满想学会了技术生活会好一些；但是，二十年来，我被剥削、被压迫，生活并没有得到丝毫改善。毛主席！要是没有您的领导，劳动人民怎么能得翻身？我怎么能得翻身？在您英明领导下，共产党解放了全中国，也解放了我。工人政治地位提高了，我的生活也有了保证。一九四九年十二月，我参加了庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的大会。在会上，看见了朱总司令，并且和朱总司令握了手。党待我们真像儿女一样呀；我深深感到了党对我们的关切热爱。二年来，在党的培养和教育下，我的觉悟逐渐提高，生产、工作积极努力。一九四九年当选为工会委员。一九五○年七月工会改选，我又连任。七月中旬，光荣地参加了中国共产党。我两次参加了全国纺织工会代表会议。十万码呢子竞赛中，我被评为工作模范。十一月，我厂进行民主改革，又提拔我做机织部车间主任；现在做着代理工会主席的工作。在您的领导下，经过三十年的艰苦斗争，才有了今天的胜利，才使得工人阶级翻过身来做了主人。敬爱的毛主席！在您英明领导下，我坚决永远前进！我保证在样样工作上起带头作用。有什么困难，我全不怕，一定克服！我保证做好工会工作，完成并超过国家给我们的生产任务。
    现在我们正在开展为抗美援朝支援志愿军捐献飞机大炮的运动，工会计划发动与组织全厂职工增加生产，捐献飞机一架。
    祝您身体健康
    清河制呢厂工人  任文忠
