    Our Great Motherland
    In the ranks of the Chinese People's Volunteers, there are hundreds and thousands of outstanding Chinese daughters. They stand at different work posts, fighting resolutely to eliminate the American aggressors. These are two female propagandists of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They perform plays and sing songs for the soldiers, and also help rescue the wounded and sick in urgent combat situations. Sometimes they shoulder guns to capture and monitor prisoners.
