      After Moving from Beijing to Chahar, I Actively Engage in Production and Live a Happier Life
      ——A Letter from Li Youxun, a Farmer in Habicun Village, Kangbao, Respectfully Addressed to Chairman Mao:
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    The 30th anniversary of our great Communist Party is approaching. During this great festival, I feel particularly happy. Under your wise leadership, thousands upon thousands of poor people have turned over and are living happy lives. I am one of them. I don't know how to express my gratitude to you! Now I want to report to you on my life after moving from Beijing to Chahar:
    I used to be a rickshaw puller, living in Chaoshou Hutong, Xuanwumen, Beijing. My family of four relied on me alone to pull the rickshaw for food. The money I earned in a day was not enough to eat for a day. The clothes we wore were all old and tattered clothes bought from the small market, and they would fall apart after only a few months. This February, I participated in the immigration, without spending a penny, and took the public train, bus, and cart to this village. Truly, under your leadership, there is the same care for the working people everywhere. When we arrived here, the cadres and villagers had already prepared houses and furniture for us. The government also lent me 2,000 jin of millet as a settling-in allowance, which I will repay in three years; I was also allocated 33 mu of land. I had never farmed before, so the villagers helped me plant. The government and the villagers helped me like this, and I am truly very touched. I must be determined to work hard and produce. I got up early and went to bed late, collecting forty-one carts of manure for the fields. The seedlings are now growing fat and strong! Others weeded the seedlings two or three times, but my wife and I weeded them four times. In the autumn, I harvested twenty-eight shi of naked oats and two thousand four hundred jin of yam. My children are also going to school. All four of us have put on new clothes. The village saw that I worked well and elected me as a labor model, allowing me to participate in labor model conferences at the district, county, and even provincial levels. I also shook hands with Zhang Su, the chairman of the provincial government, and he told us many production methods. After returning to the village, the government gave me more than fifty mu of land from the fleeing landlords to cultivate. With more land but no livestock, my wife and I joined the labor exchange team and used manual labor to exchange for oxen to cultivate the land. It looks like I will be able to harvest at least sixty shi of grain and more than three thousand jin of yam in the autumn. In addition to paying the public grain, I can also buy a set of ox carts. This year, the government lent me another 220,000 yuan, and I also built two new houses.
    I am the leader of the labor exchange team and the newspaper reading team in this village. During rest periods, we study production techniques and read newspapers. We owe this happy life to you. But the American devils are invading Korea and want to bully us. We are so happy here, I wonder how much suffering the Korean people are enduring. So I must work hard to produce more, increase income, and buy more airplanes and cannons to drive away the American devils and prevent them from bullying Korea and our Chinese people again. This is my determination.
     I wish you eternal health!
  Li Youxun, Farmer of Habicun Village, Kangbao County, Chahar

      我从北京移到察哈尔以后积极生产生活越来越幸福
      ——康保哈咇村农民李有勋的信敬爱的毛主席：
    现在咱们伟大的共产党三十周年纪念日快到了。在这伟大的节日里，我感到特别的高兴。在您的英明领导下，千千万万的穷人翻了身，过着幸福的日子。我就是其中的一个。我心里不知道怎么样感激您！现在我要向您报告我由北京移来到察哈尔后的生活情况：
    我原是一个三轮车工人，原住在北京宣武门内抄手胡同，全家四口就靠我一个人蹬三轮吃饭，一天挣的钱不够一天吃，穿的全是从小市上买来的破旧衣服，穿不了几个月就烂了。今年二月我参加了移民，没花一个钱，就坐着公家的火车、汽车、大车来到这村里。真是在您领导下到处都是一样的照顾劳动人民，来到这里，干部和老乡们早把房子和家具给我们预备齐全了。政府还借给我两千斤小米的安家费，让我三年还清；还分给了我三十三亩地。我没种过地，老乡们就帮助我种上。政府和老乡们这样帮助我，我真是感动得很。我一定要下决心好好劳动生产。我早起晚睡，拾了四十一车粪上在地里。苗儿这下子可长得又肥又壮了！别人把苗锄两遍、三遍，我就和我女人锄了四遍。秋后我打了二十八石莜麦，还有两千四百斤山药。我孩子也上学了。我们四口人都换上了新衣裳。村里看我劳动好，还选了我当劳动模范，让我参加了区、县、一直到省的劳动模范会议。我还和省政府张苏主席握了手，他还给我们讲了好些生产办法。回到村里，政府又把逃亡地主的五十多亩地给我种了。地多了没牲口，我就和女人参加了拨工组，用人工换牛把地种上了。看样子，秋天最少也能打六十多石粮食和三千多斤山药。除了交公粮外，还能买一套牛车。今年政府又借给了我二十二万元，我还盖了两间新房子哩。
    我是这村里的拨工组长和读报组长。在休息时，我们就研究生产的技术，读报纸。像我们这种幸福的生活，都是您给我们的。可是美国鬼子正在侵略朝鲜，还想来欺侮咱。我们这里这么幸福，不知朝鲜人民多么苦难哩。所以我一定要好好劳动多生产，增加收入，多买飞机大炮，把美国鬼子打跑，不要它再欺侮朝鲜、欺侮咱们中国人民。这就是我的决心。
     祝您永远健康！
  察哈尔康保县哈咇村农民李有勋上
