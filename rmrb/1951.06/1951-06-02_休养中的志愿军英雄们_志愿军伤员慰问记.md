　　Visiting Wounded Volunteer Army Heroes
　　——A Record of Visiting the Volunteer Army Wounded
　　Geng Zhi
　　When visiting the heroic, wounded Volunteer Army comrades, the most frustrating thing was "time." Each of our groups, representing all comrades of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, had to visit more than a dozen wards in two or three hours. Time pressed us so much that we often sat down and started talking before we even had time to ask their names, and we often had to interrupt lively conversations to say goodbye. We deeply regretted not being able to talk freely with the Volunteer Army comrades.

　　Volunteer Army comrades – the flowers of the working people of the motherland. They possess the most beautiful qualities of the Chinese people: simplicity, enthusiasm, strength, and courage. They are the embodiment of patriotism! There are so many new things about them that it is difficult to fully understand them even with a day, a month, or a year of contact. We know too little about them. However, the nobility of their character, the breadth of their minds, and the brightness of their eyes are already enough to inspire and excite us.

　　In their conversations, they affirmed the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea with every word, full of confidence in victory. One comrade with his arm in a sling said, "The enemy uses airplanes, cannons, and tanks, but we rely on rifles, bayonets, and hand grenades, seeing them within twenty meters! Those American devils are so useless that we capture them in large groups." Although the American devils were so incompetent, they still did not underestimate the enemy on the front lines. They said, "The commanders told us not to underestimate the enemy and not to be taken advantage of." When talking about the source of their strength, they said, "As soon as we entered Korea, we saw desolation everywhere. Not a single house was intact. The people suffered deeply. We could smell the stench of charred corpses everywhere. You can imagine how sad we were. Many comrades shed tears. We thought of our motherland's Northeast, of Beijing, of Chairman Mao. Comrades, do you think we could allow such a tragic scene to be moved to our motherland? So, as soon as we arrived at the front, our eyes turned red." They told us that the more cruel and difficult the war, the stronger the Volunteer Army's fighting spirit became. There was even a young comrade in his teens who wrote a diary while guarding a mountain top. He wrote in his diary how many enemies he had killed and how many weapons he had captured. He said, "Even if I sacrifice myself, I will definitely send my diary back to the motherland so that the elders know that I have avenged them." What else can we say about such an army and such soldiers?

　　They love Chairman Mao so much, asking us with childlike innocence, "We've been in Beijing for almost a month, and we haven't seen Chairman Mao yet! Comrades, when will we be able to see Chairman Mao?" We told them, "As long as you recuperate well and get better, you will definitely have the opportunity to see Chairman Mao in the future." They calmed down happily.

　　They were extremely concerned about our work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. When we described the accusation meeting on the 20th of last month, the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries made their eyes widen and their faces flushed. But when it came to suppressing 221 counter-revolutionaries, the people applauded and cheered, and even eight-year-old children and old ladies in their fifties and sixties stood up to catch special agents, they laughed loudly.

　　We reported to them about the Public Security Bureau's situation in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We talked about how many comrades wrote pledges and blood letters asking to go to Korea, and when they were not allowed, they cried, and some were even restless at work. They interrupted us very anxiously, "Comrades, the front and the rear are the same. Without the rear, where would the front be!" It was not until we talked about how, after persuasion and education, everyone put their enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea into their work, and signed patriotic covenants and patriotic rules, and the work efficiency was significantly improved, that they breathed a sigh of relief. Their concern for the rear was so considerate. One comrade said, "You don't have to come to see us often," and then he quickly explained to our surprised expressions, "It's not that we don't want to see you, but the rear is busy with work, and we're afraid you'll be delayed."

　　The heroically wounded Volunteer Army comrades are at the rear but their hearts are at the front. They cannot forget the Korean front for a moment. The most frustrating thing for them is not getting news from the Korean front. Several comrades said, "It's like being trapped in a muffled gourd, it's really suffocating!"

　　We distributed letters of慰问 and gifts to them, and read them the letter of慰问 from all the comrades of the Public Security Bureau. They were extremely moved. They said, "Since we arrived at the rear, the people's concern for us has been endless. We are very ashamed that we have returned before the task assigned to us by the people has been completed." They are so humble. Comrades in two wards immediately wrote us a reply, asking us to take it to all the comrades. The letter said, "We will definitely listen to the doctor's treatment, recover our health as soon as possible, and return to the front. We hope you will work harder, prevent sabotage by special agents, defend Beijing, defend Chairman Mao, and dedicate all your strength to the people of the motherland!"

　　The short visit made us feel like we were in a close and warm feeling, in an atmosphere of the Volunteer Army's strength and courage. When we said goodbye, the whole hospital resounded with thunderous applause. From the applause, we felt the glorious future of the Chinese people.

　　休养中的志愿军英雄们
    ——志愿军伤员慰问记
    耿直
    在慰问英勇负伤的志愿军同志时，最使人苦恼的就是“时间”。我们每一个小组代表北京市公安局全体同志在两三个小时内慰问十几个病房，时间是这样压迫着我们，以至于我们连姓名都来不及问就坐下谈起来，又往往不得不打断正在谈得起劲的谈话而告别。我们深为未能和志愿军同志畅谈而惋惜。
    志愿军同志——祖国劳动人民的花朵。他们具有中国人民最美好的品质：朴素、热情、坚强、勇敢，他们是爱国主义的化身！他们的身上有那么多新的东西，即令是一天、一月、一年的接触，也难于完全了解，我们对他们知道得太少了。但是，他们品质的高尚，他们胸襟的宽广，他们眼睛的明亮，已经足以鼓舞我们，兴奋我们了。
    他们在谈话中，对抗美援朝战争一字一句都是肯定的，充满了胜利的信心。一个手臂挂在绷带里的同志说：“敌人用飞机、大炮、坦克车，咱们就凭步枪、刺刀、手榴弹，二十米远以内见！鬼子可稀松，俘虏一赶一大群。”虽然美国鬼子这样草包，但是他们在前线上还是一点也不轻敌的，他们说：“指挥员告诉我们，可不要小看敌人，不要吃他的亏。”在说到他们力量的源泉时，他们说：“一进入朝鲜，满眼荒凉，一间房子也不完整，老乡们遭受了深重的苦难，到处可以闻到烧焦的死尸味，你们想我们是多么难过，许多同志都流泪了，我们想到了祖国的东北，想到了北京，想到了毛主席，同志，你们说，我们能让这种惨景搬来祖国吗？所以我们一到前线，眼睛都红了。”他们告诉我们，战争越残酷越艰苦，志愿军的斗志就越坚强。曾经有一个十几岁的小同志，一边在守山头，一边在写日记。日记上写着杀了多少敌人，缴了多少武器，他说：“即令我牺牲了，也一定把日记送回祖国，让父老们知道我给他们报了仇。”这样的军队，这样的战士，我们还有什么可说的呢？
    他们是这样热爱毛主席，孩子般天真地问我们：“我们来北京快一个月了，还没见毛主席哩！同志，我们什么时候才能见毛主席呢？”我们告诉他们：“只要好好休养，身体好了，将来一定有机会见到毛主席的。”他们愉快地安静下来了。
    他们极端关心我们的镇压反革命工作，当我们叙述上月二十日的控诉大会时，反革命的罪行使他们眼睛睁得飞圆，脸都涨红了。但谈到镇压二百二十一个反革命分子后，老百姓鼓掌称快，八岁小孩、五六十岁老大娘都起来捉特务时，他们又大声地笑了起来。
    我们向他们报告了公安局抗美援朝的情形，谈到许多同志写志愿书、写血书要求上朝鲜，不准许就哭起来，有的甚至不安心工作时，他们非常着急地打断了我们的话：“同志，前方后方是一样，没有后方那里有前方！”一直到谈到经过说服教育，大家把抗美援朝的热情贯彻到工作中去，订了爱国公约、爱国守则，工作效率显著提高时，他们才松了一口气，他们对后方的关心是如此的体贴入微。一个同志说：“你们不要常来看我们，”接着他又赶快向我们惊异的神情作解释：“不是不愿见你们，后方工作忙，怕你们耽搁了工作。”
    英勇负伤的志愿军同志身在后方而心在前方，他们一时一刻也忘不了朝鲜前线，最使他们苦闷的是得不到朝鲜前线的消息，好几个同志都这样说：“好像钻进闷葫芦里，真闷得慌！”
    我们将慰问信、慰问品分发给他们，给他们读了公安局全体同志的慰问信，他们感动极了。他们说：“我们一到后方，人民对我们的关心真是说不尽的了，我们非常惭愧，人民交给我们的任务，还没有完成就回来了。”他们是这样的谦虚。两个病室的同志马上给我们写了回信，要我们带给全体同志，信上说：“我们一定好好听从医生治疗，早日恢复健康，回前线去。希望你们好好加紧工作，防止特务破坏，保卫北京，保卫毛主席，为祖国人民献出一切力量！”
    短短的慰问，使我们感觉到是置身在亲切热烈的感情之中，置身在志愿军坚强勇敢的气氛之中。当我们告别时，全医院响起来雷般的掌声。从掌声里，我们感到中国人民光辉的前途。
