    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] TASS, 3rd: According to Tokyo sources, the ashes of 4,500 Japanese who died on the Korean front in the autumn of 1950 were recently shipped to Yokohama.
    In order to cover up the fact that Japanese were participating in the Korean War, the American occupation authorities have ordered that the relatives of the deceased be prohibited from holding funerals, and they are not allowed to tell others about it. The Japanese police are closely monitoring to ensure that they comply with the orders of the American occupation authorities.

    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社三日讯：据东京消息，一九五○年秋季在朝鲜前线死亡的四千五百名日本人的骨灰，不久以前已运抵横滨。
    美国占领当局为了掩盖日本人参加朝鲜战争的事实，已下令禁止死亡者的亲属举行葬仪，也不准他们告诉别人。日本警察正严密注意，以确保他们遵从美国占领当局的命令。
