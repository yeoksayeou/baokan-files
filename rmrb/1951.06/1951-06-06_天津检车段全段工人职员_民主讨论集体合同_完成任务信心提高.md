The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Tianjin Inspection Depot's employees democratically discussed and established a collective contract, enhancing the entire depot's confidence in completing tasks. Before signing the collective contract, the depot held a meeting of Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres, and then mobilized all employees to discuss and propose the issues to be resolved in establishing the collective contract. After three days of discussion, the employees put forward more than one hundred and twenty opinions. The vast majority of these opinions were aimed at ensuring the completion of the production plans assigned by higher authorities. Based on these opinions, the depot drafted a collective contract and distributed the draft to workers and cadres for discussion. The workers discussed for four days and put forward eighty opinions on revising the draft. Based on these opinions, the depot finalized the contents of the collective contract, conveyed it to the workers, and mobilized the workers to discuss how to implement the collective contract. At that time, the workers said, "The contract content is good, but we are afraid it will not be honored!" They felt, "Completing the task is no problem, but we are afraid the material supply will not be timely!" Some said, "We can complete the task, but what if other departments don't cooperate?" In order to solve this problem, the depot established liaison contracts, including liaison contracts between production departments and material departments, liaison contracts between workshops, and mutual guarantee contracts between the inspection depot and other stations and depots. This enhanced the employees' determination to implement the collective contract.

After the depot's administration and trade union signed these collective contracts, all the workers at the depot knew the contents of the contract, and they successively established individual plans to ensure the completion of tasks.

　　天津检车段全段工人职员
    民主讨论集体合同  完成任务信心提高
    天津铁路管理局天津检车段职工民主讨论订立集体合同，增强了全段职工完成任务的信心。在签订集体合同之前，该段召开了党、行政、工会和青年团的干部会议，然后发动全体职工讨论，提出在订立集体合同中所要解决的问题。经过三天的讨论，职工们提出了一百二十多条意见。这些意见，绝大多数都是保证完成上级生产计划的。根据这些意见，该段订立了集体合同草案，并把草案发给工人和干部讨论。工人们讨论了四天，又提出了八十条修改草案的意见。根据这些意见，该段决定了集体合同的内容，向工人进行传达，并发动工人讨论怎样实现集体合同。当时工人就说：“合同内容虽好，就怕不能兑现！”他们觉得：“完成任务没问题，就怕材料供应不及时！”有的说：“咱们能完成任务，但是别的部门，配合不上，怎么办？”为了解决这个问题，该段就以联系合同的方式，订立了生产部门和材料部门的联系合同、车间与车间的联系合同、检车段与其他站、段的互保合同，这样，就增强了职工们实现集体合同的决心。
    该段行政和工会签订了这些集体合同之后，该段工人都知道了合同的内容，于是纷纷订立个人计划，保证完成任务。
