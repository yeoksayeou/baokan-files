　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Echoing the struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Lao people's war of resistance against the French is developing gradually towards victory. According to Vietnam News Agency: In 1950, the Lao Liberation Army fought the French army nearly a hundred times on the southern front in Laos, eliminating more than 500 enemy officers and soldiers, and liberating vast areas between the Mekong River, the Boloven Plateau, and Attapeu, which is close to central and southern Vietnam.
    At the beginning of this year, the French colonial authorities sent many reinforcements to southern Laos, but the Lao Liberation Army continued to launch offensives, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. On February 12, the Liberation Army attacked two companies of the enemy, killing and wounding 69 enemy soldiers. On March 7, the Liberation Army ambushed an enemy transportation team on Highway 18, seizing a large amount of gasoline and supplies. On the same day, the Liberation Army stormed into the enemy's stronghold in the city of Pakse, seizing all of the enemy's machinery. From March 8 to 26, the Lao Liberation Army attacked three enemy transportation teams on Highway 13, destroying three large bridges and cutting off Highway 13. In March alone, the Lao Liberation Army annihilated 100 French troops and mercenaries, and seized 22 light and heavy machine guns and 100 rifles. Under the victorious offensive of the Liberation Army, many Lao mercenaries have deserted with their weapons.
    In 1950, the Lao Liberation Army consolidated its base areas in the Attapeu region on the right bank of the Mekong River, as well as in the areas of Saravane and Boloven. This year, in addition to the regular army, local militias have also been organized and armed to participate in the fighting. The Liberation Army also actively carried out political work, helping the people and mobilizing them to fully participate in the war of resistance. Due to the expansion of the liberated areas, the establishment of the Lao resistance government, and the increasing consolidation of the people's regime, the confidence of the Lao people in resisting aggression and striving for national independence has been greatly strengthened.

　　老挝人民英勇斗争        
    去年在南部作战百次解放广阔地区
    【新华社十日讯】与越南人民的战斗互相呼应的老挝人民的抗法战争，正在逐渐胜利发展中。据越南通讯社讯：老挝解放军一九五○年一年中在老挝南部前线对法军作战近一百次，消灭敌军官兵五百多名，解放了湄公河、波罗芬高原和接近中越南部的阿速坡之间的广阔地区。
    今年初，法国殖民地当局派许多援军到老挝南部去，但老挝解放军继续展开攻势，使敌军蒙受严重损失。二月十二日，解放军袭击敌军两个连，毙伤敌军六十九名。三月七日，解放军在第十八号公路上截击敌军运输队，缴获大量汽油和物资。同日，解放军冲入百色城的敌军据点，缴获敌人的全部机器。从三月八日到二十六日，老挝解放军在第十三号公路袭击敌军三个运输队，破坏三座大桥，切断了十三号公路。仅三月份一个月，老挝解放军共歼灭法军和雇佣兵一百人，并缴获轻重机枪二十二挺、步枪一百支。在解放军的胜利攻势下已有许多老挝的雇佣兵携械投诚。
    老挝解放军一九五○年在湄公河右岸阿速坡地区以及巴沙和波罗芬地区，巩固了根据地。今年，除了正规军外，地方民兵也已经组织和武装起来，参加战斗。解放军也积极展开了政治工作，帮助人民，动员人民全力参加抗战。由于解放地区的扩大，老挝抗战政府的建立，人民政权的日益巩固，大大加强老挝人民反抗侵略、争取民族独立的信心。
