　　[Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The 22-member visiting delegation of student representatives from various countries who attended the Beijing meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Student Union, led by International Student Union Secretary-General Beringer, left Beijing this morning to return to their home countries. Those who saw them off at the airport included: International Student Union Vice President Yang Cheng, All-China Students' Federation Chairman Xie Bangding, Communist Youth League Central Committee Secretary Feng Wenbin, Secretary-General Rong Gaotang, and more than 400 representatives from various people's organizations and Beijing students.
    After returning to Beijing on May 28, the visiting delegation visited the Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Quick Completion Middle School and the Beijing Library, and visited the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, briefed them on the situation of the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace and resist American aggression and aid Korea. Beringer assured Guo Moruo that students all over the world would intensify their struggle against aggression and to defend world peace, and wished the Chinese people greater success in the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea.
    On the eve of their departure from Beijing, the visiting delegation attended a farewell banquet jointly held by the All-China Students' Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Youth Federation. At the meeting, Beringer, on behalf of the International Student Union, presented a carved glass to the All-China Students' Federation to be given to the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, expressing the love and admiration of students all over the world for him.
    Before their departure, the student representatives from various countries of the International Student Union visiting delegation jointly issued a statement, and Beringer also delivered a radio speech. The statement said: We thank the Chinese youth and students and the Chinese people for their hospitality. The progress in education in liberated China has deeply impressed us. We have seen that workers and peasants have the opportunity to receive education, and that minority nationalities are freely developing their culture and education for the first time with the help of the government. The curriculum and teaching methods in schools are being reformed to closely integrate theory with practice and serve the construction of a new China. We have seen that Chinese students and the Chinese people are doing their best to defend peace. Chinese students have unanimously participated in the large-scale movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, expressing their determination to oppose aggression. Almost all students have signed the Declaration of the Peace Covenant and voted against arming Japan. Chinese students deeply sympathize with students in colonial and dependent countries who are struggling for national independence, and are preparing to participate in the World Youth and Student Peace Festival with the best results. We believe that it is important to tell the youth and students of all countries everything we have seen. We will use all our strength to strengthen the friendship of students from all countries towards the new China, support the Chinese students' struggle against aggression, and demand that the United Nations, which is manipulated by the United States, cease its hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China. We firmly believe that students all over the world taking these actions will help strengthen the common struggle for peace, national independence, democratic education, and a bright future.

　　国际学联访问团离京返国
    行前发表声明感谢我国人民的招待
    决支持我国学生反侵略的正义斗争
    【新华社一日讯】出席国际学生联合会执行委员会北京会议的各国学生代表访问团一行二十二人，由国际学联总书记贝林格率领，于今晨离北京返国，到机场欢送的有：国际学联副主席杨诚，中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬、秘书长荣高棠，以及各人民团体和北京市学生代表等四百余人。
    访问团从五月二十八日回到北京后，参观了北京实验工农速成中学和北京图书馆，访问了中国人民抗美援朝总会、中华全国总工会和中华全国民主妇女联合会。中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若向他们介绍了中国人民保卫世界和平、抗美援朝运动的情况。贝林格向郭沫若保证全世界学生将加紧进行反对侵略保卫世界和平的斗争，并祝中国人民在抗美援朝运动中获得更大的成功。
    访问团在离京前夕，出席了中华全国学生联合会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国民主青年联合总会联合举行的欢送宴会。会上贝林格代表国际学生联合会以刻花玻璃杯一个请全国学联转献给中国人民领袖毛主席，表示全世界学生对他的热爱和钦敬。
    国际学联访问团的各国学生代表在行前联合发表声明，贝林格并发表了广播演说。声明说：我们感谢中国青年学生和中国人民的招待。解放后的中国在教育上的进步给我们极为深刻的印象。我们看到工人和农民有了受教育的机会，少数民族第一次在政府的帮助下自由发展文化和教育。学校里的课程和教学方法正在进行改革，以使理论和实际紧密结合，为建设新中国而服务。我们看到中国学生和中国人民正以全力保卫和平。中国学生一致参加规模巨大的抗美援朝运动，表示了反侵略的决心。几乎全体学生都在和平公约宣言上签了名，并且投票反对武装日本。中国学生深切同情殖民地附属国中为争取民族独立而斗争的学生，并且正在准备用最好的成绩参加世界青年、学生和平联欢节。我们认为把我们看到的一切告诉各国青年学生是一件重要工作。我们将用一切力量来加强各国学生对新中国的友谊，支持中国学生反侵略的斗争，并要求被美国操纵的联合国停止对中华人民共和国的敌对态度。我们深信全世界学生采取这些行动，将有助于加强为和平、民族独立、民主教育和美好的未来而进行的共同斗争。
