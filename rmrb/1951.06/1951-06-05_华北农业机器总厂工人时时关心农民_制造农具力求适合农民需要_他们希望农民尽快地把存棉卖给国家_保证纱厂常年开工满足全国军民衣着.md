Workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, after seeing the instructions from the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton sales and storage, and the call from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, started discussing them fervently. Hou Quan, a famous labor model in the factory, said, "We guarantee to our farmer brothers that we will manufacture more affordable and high-quality agricultural tools to help them increase production. We also hope that our farmer brothers will respond to the call of the State Council and sell their stored cotton to the state to ensure that textile mill workers have jobs." Xie Youzhen, a blacksmith who had lived in cotton-producing areas of Hebei, planned to write to his farmer friends, advising them to sell their stored cotton to the state immediately. He believed that the farmer brothers would definitely support the State Council's instructions. He said, "Our farmer brothers only turned themselves around after the Communist Party came, and they would never stand idly by and watch our textile mills shut down due to lack of cotton, nor would they ever watch the people and military across the country face difficulties in getting clothes."

"Strive to manufacture affordable and high-quality agricultural tools welcomed by farmers!" This is the slogan for the entire workforce at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. They deeply understand that manufacturing affordable and high-quality agricultural tools in large quantities can help farmer brothers increase production efficiency, increase agricultural product income, improve farmers' lives, and continuously meet the needs of industrial raw materials. This is the foundation for making our motherland move from a backward agricultural country to a strong industrial country.

The workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory remember that at the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition in 1949, they heard farmer brothers criticize the agricultural tools they manufactured: "Some are too expensive, and some are not suitable." This criticism drew their serious attention. From that time on, they thought every day about how to reduce the cost of agricultural tools and how to make agricultural tools suitable for farmers' needs. They took the initiative to consult with farmers and went to the countryside to conduct practical investigations. They found that the agricultural tools manufactured in the past were too bulky, too many types, and not what the farmers urgently needed. What farmers urgently needed was plows, but they had not manufactured them in large quantities. In 1950, they decided to manufacture plows in large quantities. This was difficult for them; however, the difficulties could not stop them. At the end of 1950, they finally produced more than 8,000 plows. When these plows reached the farmers, they were very happy and hoped that the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory would produce more of these agricultural tools. But the farmers still felt that the price of the plows was a bit high. The workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory said, "We must work hard to reduce costs and lower the cost of plows as much as possible!"

The workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory launched a fervent patriotic labor competition movement to reduce costs. The workers thought of ways everywhere, using waste materials and saving materials. The team led by Zhang Fengquan reduced the consumption of cotton wadding and oil by 20%. Huang Runping, the deputy leader of the team, said, "This is not enough, we must also improve tools and increase productivity." This April, they transformed eight kinds of tools and created three kinds of tools. This year, all the workers in their team have overfulfilled their tasks. Qi Shengqian, an assembly worker, said, "The plows we make must meet the standards; otherwise, how can we be worthy of the farmers?" In fact, the plows they assembled this year all met the standards. This July, the employees of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory guaranteed to reduce costs by 10%. Yu Binglian, the chairman of the trade union, told me, "This guarantee can be honored." According to Li Hanru, an engineer at the factory, "Due to the reduction in costs, the price of our plows can be reduced by 30 to 40 catties of millet per plow."

This year, farmers from North China and Northwest China have written letters praising the plows of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory as "very good!" and they requested to sell them more. In the past five months of this year, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has made more than 20,000 plows. More than 11,000 assembled plows have already been sold to farmers. There are still more than 10,000 plows being assembled. Because the needs of farmers are increasing day by day, the workers at the factory are stepping up the production of plows under the general goal of reducing costs. Xie Youzhen, a blacksmith, said, "We feel sad when we think of the farmer brothers using old-fashioned agricultural tools that take a lot of effort and do not grow good crops. We have a responsibility to help farmer brothers manufacture more new-style agricultural tools." In order to quickly make more plows, Xie Youzhen's team increased production efficiency fivefold. When they heard that farmers were still very short of plows, they said, "We must also increase production efficiency to solve the problem of the lack of plows for farmer brothers." The workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are constantly concerned about the needs of the farmers. When they found that farmers in the cotton-producing areas of North China needed small weeding hoes, they tried all kinds of methods and made thousands of weeding hoes and sold them. They told reporters, "With this thing, cotton farmers can weed the fields quickly!"

From the conversations of the workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, we can see the strength of the unity between workers and farmers. This strength will surely guarantee the elimination of the difficulties in the national textile mills due to lack of raw materials, and make our country's economic construction develop step by step.

　　华北农业机器总厂工人时时关心农民
    制造农具力求适合农民需要
    他们希望农民尽快地把存棉卖给国家
    保证纱厂常年开工满足全国军民衣着
    华北农业机器总厂工人看到中央人民政府政务院关于售棉、储棉工作的指示和中共中央的号召后，纷纷谈论起来。该厂著名的劳动模范侯全说：“咱们向农民弟兄们保证，多制造价廉物美的农具，帮助农民弟兄们增加生产；咱们也希望农民弟兄们，响应政务院的号召，把存棉卖给国家，保证纱厂工人有工作做。”锻工谢友珍曾经在河北产棉区住过，他准备写信给他的农民朋友，劝他们马上把存棉卖给国家。他相信农民弟兄们一定拥护政务院的指示。他说：“咱们农民弟兄们是共产党来了才翻了身的，决不会眼睁睁地看着咱们纱厂因为没有棉花而停工，决不会眼看着全国军民穿衣服发生困难。”
    “为制造农民所欢迎的物美价廉的农具而斗争！”这是华北农业机器总厂全体工人奋斗的口号。他们深深地懂得：大量地制造价廉物美的农具，可以帮助农民弟兄们提高生产效率，增收农业产品，改善农民生活，并能不断地满足工业原料的需要。这是使得我们祖国从落后的农业国走向强有力的工业国的基础。
    华北农业机器总厂的工人记得，在一九四九年的天津工业展览会上，听见农民弟兄们批评他们制造的农具：“有些是太贵，有些又不适用。”这个批评引起了他们严重的注意。从那个时候起，他们天天考虑着怎样减低农具的成本，怎样使农具适合农民的需要。他们主动地找农民商量，到农村去作实际的调查。他们发现过去制造的农具太笨重，种类过多，但不是农民迫切需要的。农民迫切需要的是犁，而他们却没有大量制造。一九五○年，他们决定大量制造犁。这对于他们是有困难的；不过，困难阻挡不住他们。一九五○年底，他们终于做出了八千多具犁。这些犁到了农民手中，农民们都非常高兴，希望华北农业机器总厂多生产这样的农具。但是农民们还觉得犁的价格高了一些。华北农业机器总厂工人说：“咱们一定要努力减低成本，尽量降低犁的成本！”
    华北农业机器总厂的工人如火如荼地开展了降低成本的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。工人们处处想办法，利用废料，节省材料。张风泉所领导的小组把棉丝和油料的消费量减少了百分之二十。该组副组长黄润平说：“这还不够，我们还要改良工具，提高生产率。”今年四月，他们改造了八种工具，创造了三种工具。今年他们全组工人都超额完成了任务。装配工人齐盛谦说：“咱们做的犁，一定要合规格；不然，怎么对得起农民呢？”实际上他们今年装配的犁是没有不合规格的。今年七月份，华北农业机器总厂职工们保证要降低成本百分之十。工会主席余秉廉对我说：“这个保证是可以兑现的。”据该厂工程师李翰如估计：“由于成本降低，我们的犁的价格每具可减少三、四十斤小米。”
    今年华北、西北的农民纷纷来信，称赞华北农业机器总厂的犁“好得很！”，他们要求能多卖给他们一些。今年五个月内，华北农业机器总厂已做出两万多具犁。装配好的一万一千多具犁，都已经卖给农民了。还有一万多具犁，正在装配中。因为农民的需要日增，该厂工人们在降低成本的总目标之下，加紧地增加犁的产量。锻工谢友珍说：“咱们想起农民弟兄们在使用费力气又种不好庄稼的旧式农具，心里就难过。咱们有责任帮助农民弟兄们制造更多的新式农具。”谢友珍的小组为了赶快制出更多的犁，把生产效率提高了五倍。当他们听说农民们还非常缺乏犁的时候，他们说：“咱们还要提高生产效率，解决农民弟兄们缺犁的困难。”华北农业机器总厂工人们经常地关心着农民们的要求。当他们发现华北产棉区的农民需要小型的耘锄，他们就想尽种种方法，做了好几千部耘锄，卖了出去。他们对记者说：“棉农有了这个家伙，耘地就快哪！”
    从华北农业机器总厂工人的谈话中，可以看到工人农民团结的力量。这个力量，一定会保证解除全国纱厂缺乏原料的困难，使我们祖国的经济建设一步一步地发展起来。
