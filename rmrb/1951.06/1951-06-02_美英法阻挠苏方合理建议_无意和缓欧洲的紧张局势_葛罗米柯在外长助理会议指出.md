Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th: The meeting of the Assistant Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers continued from the 21st to the 25th.

　　After the Soviet delegation agreed to the suggestion of the US, British and French representatives to submit the issue of eliminating German militarism, and its place on the agenda, to the Foreign Ministers' meeting for a decision, the representatives of the three countries continued to stir up pointless disturbances at the meeting regarding this issue. As a result of the active efforts of the Soviet delegation, the representatives of the US, Britain, and France were finally forced to accept the Soviet proposal on this issue on the 21st.

　　With an agreement reached on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting, only one obstacle remained, namely, the continued stubborn opposition by the representatives of the US, Britain, and France to including the Soviet proposal on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and American military bases as unresolved items on the agenda. They could not even think of any newly fabricated "arguments" to defend their position, and remained silent at both meetings on the 23rd and 24th.

　　Soviet representative Gromyko made a statement at the meeting on the 25th. He emphasized that the main reason for the current tension in Europe is the establishment of a military aggression bloc based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the establishment of American military bases in foreign territories targeting the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. After the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty, relations between the Soviet Union and the three Western countries of the US, Britain, and France have become even worse. This precisely illustrates why the Soviet Union proposed the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and American military bases. Anyone who wants to ease the tension in Europe and improve relations between the four countries, not only in words but also in deeds, cannot oppose this proposal. The blatant refusal of the US, Britain, and France to consider this most important issue shows that they are unwilling to eliminate the current tension in Europe, but instead hope that this state of affairs will continue in order to achieve their aggressive goals. We believe that it is unreasonable to convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers without discussing and resolving this issue.

　　美英法阻挠苏方合理建议
    无意和缓欧洲的紧张局势 
    葛罗米柯在外长助理会议指出
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息：四国外长助理会议于二十一日至二十五日继续举行。
    在苏联代表团同意美、英、法三国代表的建议，将肃清德国军国主义问题在议程上的地位问题提交外长会议决定以后，三国代表曾继续在会上就这个问题掀起无谓的纷扰。结果由于苏联代表团的积极努力，美、英、法三国代表终于不得不在二十一日接受了苏联就这个问题提出的建议。
    就外长会议议程获得协议，已只有一个障碍阻挠着，那就是美、英、法三国代表继续在会上死硬地反对将苏联所提出的北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题作为未获协议的部分列入议程。他们甚至已想不出任何虚构的新“论据”来为他们这种立场辩护，而连续在二十三日及二十四日两次会议上默默无言。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在二十五日会议上发表声明。他着重指出：目前欧洲局势紧张的主要原因，是根据北大西洋公约建立了军事侵略集团，以及美国在外国领土上建立了针对着苏联及人民民主国家的军事基地。在缔结北大西洋公约以后，苏联与美、英、法三西方国家之间的关系已变得更加恶劣。这正说明了为什么苏联要提出关于北大西洋公约与美国军事基地的建议。凡是不仅在口头上而且在行动上想要缓和欧洲紧张局势并改善四国关系的人，都不能反对这一建议。美、英、法三国悍然拒绝考虑这一最重要的问题，这就表示它们不愿意消除目前欧洲的紧张局势，而是希望这种状态继续下去，以达到它们的侵略目的。我们认为，假若召开四国外长会议而不讨论并解决这个问题，是不合理的。
