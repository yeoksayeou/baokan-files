Title: Beijing Shoe Production Lacks Unified Leadership Plan, Detrimental to Both the State and Workers

To the Editor:

Since liberation, due to the economic reorganization of the country, Beijing's shoe production has gradually shifted from retail sales to collective processing (with nearly half of the workers transferred to larger processing factories). However, due to the lack of unified leadership and planning, production is characterized by considerable blindness and serious chaos. This situation must be improved.

After May 1950, workers in the larger shoe factories in the city went without work for three months. However, after August, especially in November and December, there were too many processing orders, and workers were too busy to cope even with overtime day and night. Judging from the current situation, this year is the same. The city's major shoe factories, such as Guangyuan, New China, Huazhong, Shoe Production First Cooperative, Tianyi, etc., had a total of 630 workers in production in March this year. However, since late April, they have been suspending work separately, and since May, all have had no work. Looking at the overall situation, the sales volume of shoes this year will be higher than last year, and this autumn may be even busier than last year.

This abnormal production phenomenon is detrimental to both the state and the workers themselves. The main reasons are: (A) Various agencies and supply departments lack unified leadership and planning when placing orders, and they cannot appropriately adjust according to the specific production situation of shoe workers in the city; (B) There is no correct cost calculation, and factories adopt a bidding approach to win orders. In spring and summer, departments do not place orders. Factories stop work, and workers are forced into unemployment. Orders are concentrated in autumn and winter, resulting in a three-way scramble among factories: (1) Scramble for orders, because only with orders can they make money, so they lower costs (sometimes below the proper cost), thinking it's okay as long as they get the order; (2) Once the order is placed, there are no raw materials, and they will be penalized if they are late, so everyone rushes to buy raw materials; (3) Rush to recruit workers. This creates a chaotic situation.

First, the price of raw materials rises. At the end of last autumn, the price of leather had risen by as much as 100%, felt rose by 50%, and other shoe materials also fluctuated. Secondly, when factories rushed to recruit workers, they offered advance payments of part of the salary as a condition. Some workers had borrowed wages from four or five factories. At the same time, workers are not secure in their work. Today they finish a job, but they may not have work tomorrow, so they work frantically. Some workers made six pairs of shoes in one day and one night (usually they make just over one pair a day). Factories cut corners and use inferior materials instead of good ones. Some private merchants have been penalized for violating order contracts, such as the factory directors of Guangyuan and Beihua Shoe Factories who were sentenced to imprisonment.

This situation is not limited to private shoe factories. The Shoe Industry Joint Cooperative led by the Beijing Cooperative (which once had a maximum of 600 workers but was dissolved in January this year due to losses of 350 million yuan) and the subsequent Shoe Production First Cooperative are also the same. For example, last autumn, the Shoe Industry Joint Cooperative took an order for 8,000 pairs of felt riding boots. The original calculation of the cost of felt was 125,000 yuan per piece, but later it rose to 180,000 yuan. For 20,000 pairs of boots, it was discovered after the contract was signed that the cost of the boot noses was not included in the cost. More than 10 million yuan in advance payments to workers has not yet been recovered. The 8,000 pairs of Hankou leather five-eyelet shoes contracted last year were not completed until April this year. Among the 3,000 pairs of women's shoes, three-quarters were made of Beijing leather and Tianjin leather; among the 5,000 pairs of men's shoes, one-quarter did not use Citibank leather for the main heel, but used pigskin and scrap leather.

This chaotic situation has caused even greater losses to the workers. When there was no work last year, some workers were still looking for work at twelve o'clock at night; when they had no means of living, they had to go home or become apprentices. (This is still the case now.) When they are busy, they don't care even if they are sick from exhaustion. Some workers "drink today and get drunk today," spending money recklessly. At the same time, due to the excessive mobility, the trade union organization is also extremely unsound, and workers have no opportunities to learn.

This spring, some departments believed that the shoes made by Beijing's shoe industry were not good, so they went to Tianjin to place orders, which again caused a large flow of shoe workers between Beijing and Tianjin. This chaotic phenomenon of blind production in Beijing's shoe industry should not continue. I have the following suggestions: (1) It is hoped that a city-wide unified production leadership organization for the shoe industry can be established to grasp the city's production and needs, reasonably allocate and adjust work, and as far as possible set costs, product quality, production profits, and reasonable wages. (2) Strive to distribute the work to each month of the year. In case there is no work, the living problems of workers should be solved by unemployment relief funds or workers' welfare funds; and the trade union organization should be consolidated to strengthen worker education.

### 北京市鞋业生产缺乏统一领导计划  对国家和工人都很不利

　　北京市鞋业生产缺乏统一领导计划
    对国家和工人都很不利编辑同志：
    解放以来，由于国家经济上的改组，北京市的鞋业生产逐渐由门市销售而走向集体加工（约有近一半工人转到较大的加工工厂）；但因缺乏统一的领导和计划，生产带有很大的盲目性和严重混乱现象，这种情况必须加以改进。
    一九五○年五月以后，全市较大的鞋厂工人，有三个月没有工作做。可是八月份以后，特别是十一、二月份，由于加工订货者过多，工人日夜加班都忙不过来。依现状来看，今年又是如此。本市几个较大的鞋业工厂，如广源、新中国、华中、鞋业生产第一社、天一等五家，在今年三月份共有六百三十个工人生产。可是，自四月下旬，就分别停工，五月以来全部没有工作。就整个情况来看，今年鞋子的销售量会比去年多，今年秋末可能要比去年更忙。
    这种生产不正常的现象，对国家和工人本身都很不利。其主要原因是：（甲）各机关及供给部门在订货时没有统一领导和计划，也不能根据全市鞋工生产的具体情况适当加以调剂；（乙）没有正确成本计算，而是各厂采取投标方式争取定货。在春夏之际，各部门都不定货。工厂停工，工人被迫失业。定货都拥在秋、冬两季，各工厂就产生了三抢现象：（一）抢承定货，有了定货才能赚钱，所以就压低成本（有时低于应有成本之下），反正抢过来再说；（二）定了货没有原料，过了期要受罚，大家就抢购原料；（三）抢招工人。这样就造成一片混乱现象。
    先是原料涨价。去年秋末，皮价最高曾涨了一倍，毡子涨价百分之五十，其他鞋料亦有波动。其次，各厂在抢招工人时，就拿预借一部工资做条件、有的工人曾向四五个工厂预借了工资。同时，工人工作也不安心，今天完工，明天就不一定有工可做，于是就拚命赶活。有的工人一天一夜做了六双鞋（平时一天做一双多）。厂方则偷工减料，以坏材料代替好材料。有的私商曾因此违犯定货合同而受罚，如广源、北华鞋厂厂长曾被判徒刑。
    这种情况，不仅是私营鞋厂，北京市合作社所领导的鞋业联合社（最多曾有六○○人做工，已于今年一月因赔钱三亿五千多万而解散）及其后的鞋业第一生产社也是如此。如去秋鞋联社承订的八千双毡马靴，原计算毡的成本每张十二万五千元，后来涨到十八万。二万双靴子，在订了合同后才发现没有把靴鼻计算在成本内。预借给工人的钱到现在还有一千多万元没有收回。去年揽下的八千双汉口皮五眼鞋，到今年四月份才完成；其中三千双女鞋中还有四分之三是用的北京皮和天津皮；五千双男鞋中有四分之一不是用花旗皮做主跟，而是用猪皮和边皮。
    这种混乱现象给工人造成的损失更大。去年没活时，有的工人夜间跑到十二点还在找活；生活无着就只有回家或当小工。（现在仍然如此）而在活忙时，累病了也不管。有些工人“今日有酒今日醉”有钱就乱用。同时由于流动性太大，工会组织也极不健全，工人没有学习机会。
    今春有些部门认为北京的制鞋业作的鞋子不好，就到天津去定货，于是又引起京津间鞋业工人的大流动。北京市制鞋业这种盲目生产的混乱现象不应该再继续下去，对此我有以下几点建议：（一）希望能建立全市性的鞋业统一生产领导机构，掌握全市生产与需要情况，合理分配和调剂活件；并尽可能定出成本、产品质量、生产利润与合理的工资。（二）争取将工作分配到全年各月去做。万一没工作，则由失业救济金或工人福利金解决工人的生活问题；并巩固工会组织，加强工人教育。
