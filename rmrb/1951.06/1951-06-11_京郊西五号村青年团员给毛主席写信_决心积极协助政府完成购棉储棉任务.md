Youth League Members of Xiwuhao Village in the Suburbs of Beijing Write to Chairman Mao
　　Resolve to Actively Assist the Government in Completing the Cotton Purchase and Storage Tasks
　　The Youth League members of Xiwuhao Village in the suburbs of Beijing wrote to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to actively help the People's Government complete the cotton purchase and storage tasks. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　After the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call to sell and store cotton, we held a Youth League branch meeting on June 3 to discuss it, and unanimously decided to resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government and the Party Central Committee. We will not only mobilize our families to actively sell and store cotton, but also do a good job in publicity. Comrade Zheng Yulu has already taken the lead in selling all of his stored cotton to the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Corporation. In addition, each of us has taken on at least one publicity task. Some of us are doing rooftop broadcasts, and some are writing blackboard newspapers to promote the rationale for selling and storing cotton to the masses. Many people who had stored cotton immediately sold their cotton after listening to our advice.
　　In order to let us grow cotton, develop industry, and ensure that the military and civilians throughout the country have enough to wear and use, the People's Government lent our village more than 8,000 jin of cotton seeds last year and more than 14,000 jin this year. In addition, they also lent us a lot of grain and fertilizer. Last year, we all had a bumper harvest. Growing cotton yielded more than three times the income of growing grain. We still remember that when the Japanese devils were here, they said that cotton was a military supply and did not allow us to grow it. The Kuomintang bandits would simply find an excuse to "requisition" our cotton. Now, the People's Government is so good to us, who doesn't thank you, who doesn't thank the People's Government. However, the American imperialists want to blockade us, not allowing us to develop industry, not allowing us to live a good life. Chairman Mao, we firmly express to you: We will definitely actively help the People's Government complete the task of selling and storing cotton, so that our yarn factories can have greater development in production, to smash the imperialist blockade!
　　All Youth League members of Xiwuhao Village, Eleventh District, Beijing June 7, 1951

　　京郊西五号村青年团员给毛主席写信        
    决心积极协助政府完成购棉储棉任务
    北京市郊区西五号村全体青年团员给毛主席写信，表示一定积极帮助人民政府完成购棉储棉任务。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    中央人民政府和中国共产党中央发出售棉、储棉的号召以后，六月三日，我们就开了团支部大会讨论，一致决定坚决响应中央人民政府和党中央的号召，不但动员自己家庭积极售棉、储棉，还做好宣传工作。郑玉禄同志已经带头把全部存棉卖给花纱布公司了。另外，我们每个人最少分担了一项宣传工作，有的搞屋顶广播，有的写黑板报，向群众宣传售棉、储棉的道理。很多存棉的人听了我们的劝告，就立刻把棉花卖出去了。
    人民政府为了叫我们种棉花，发展工业，保证全国军民有穿有用，去年贷给我们村八千多斤棉籽，今年又贷给我们一万四千多斤。另外，还贷给我们许多粮食、肥料。去年，我们都丰收了，种棉花比种粮食的收入多三倍还多。我们还记得，日本鬼子在着的时候，说棉花是军用品，不让我们种。国民党匪帮随便找个岔就把我们的棉花“充公”。现在，人民政府对我们这样好，我们谁不感激您，谁不感激人民政府。可是，美帝国主义要封锁我们，不让我们发展工业，不让我们过好日子。毛主席，我们坚决向您表示：我们一定积极帮助人民政府完成售棉储棉任务，使我们的纱厂生产有更大的发展，来打碎帝国主义的封锁！
      北京市第十一区西五号村全体青年团员  一九五一年六月七日
