　　A Certain Market in Yongshun County, Hunan Province
    Forcing Barbers to Organize "Joint Ventures" is Inappropriate
    The organization of joint ventures in private industry and commerce is a good way to concentrate capital and develop industry and commerce. However, joint ventures must be based on the principle of voluntary association, and there should be no compulsion. For example, in a certain market in Yongshun County, Hunan Province, there is a barbershop joint venture where most of the barbers are unwilling to participate. However, the director of the venture insists on doing so. This director is a barber and also the director of the Farmers' Association (Editor's note: If he is a barber, he should not also be the director of the Farmers' Association). If others do not join the venture, he labels them with big hats. Under these circumstances, all twenty-eight barbers in the market had no choice but to join. When they work, they are divided into four groups, and it is stipulated that they go to work at 9:00 AM and leave work at 4:00 PM every day. The director does not work and can withdraw cash at any time, while other workers have to wait until 6:00 PM after settlement to withdraw money. This kind of joint venture is not suitable for the needs of the masses and does not benefit the work. It is a very unreasonable phenomenon.

　　湖南永绥县某市场        
    不应强迫理发工人组织“联营”
    私人工商业联营的组织，本来是集中资本发展工商业的好办法，但是联营必须以自愿组合为原则，不应有任何勉强。如湖南永绥县某市场有一个理发联营社，理发工人大都不愿意联营，只是该社主任一定要这样作。这个主任是个理发工人兼农会主任（编者按：既是理发工人，就不应兼农会主任），别人不入社，他就扣大帽子。在这种情形下，全市场二十八个理发工人只好都入了社。他们工作时分成四个组，规定每天早上九点上班，下午四时下班。主任不做事，随时可支取现钱，别的工人倒要等下午六时结账后才能支钱。这样的联营方式，既不适合群众要求，对工作也没有什么好处，是一种很不合理的现象。
