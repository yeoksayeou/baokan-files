　　Beijing Sports Circles to Hold Charity Ball Games
    Responding to the Donation of a "Sports" Aircraft
    [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Political Department of the North China Military Region, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Sports Association, the Beijing Student Union, and the Youth Service Department – seven organizations in total – responded to the call from the China Peace Committee and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation to donate airplanes and cannons. On the 9th, they jointly formed the "Preparatory Committee for the Sports Performance Rally for Donating a Sports Aircraft," and decided to organize basketball, volleyball, and soccer charity matches involving teams from Beijing, other cities, and overseas, as well as swimming charity events, to raise funds for purchasing airplanes and cannons. The preliminary plan is as follows: In June, the charity games will mainly involve matches between overseas teams and local Beijing teams (starting on the 16th at the Cultural Palace of the Working People); in July, teams from other cities will be invited to compete in Beijing; and during the summer vacation, the Beijing representative team will be organized to compete in various regions.
