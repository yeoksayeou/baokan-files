Hubei Province's state-owned cotton and textile companies and their branches have been employing diverse methods to procure cotton in May and June. The cotton and textile companies in Jingzhou, Huanggang, Xiangyang and other regions have purchased more than 800,000 jin of cotton from approximately June 4th to the 15th. The Tianmen branch organized mobile purchasing teams that went deep into rural areas. On the one hand, they combined with land reform work teams to conduct propaganda to dispel cotton farmers' concerns. On the other hand, they mobilized farmers' associations to form purchasing groups by village, with the township head and farmers' association chairman serving as the chief and deputy leaders, directly persuading farmers to sell. In this way, they purchased about 25,000 jin in the first half of May. By mid-June, they had purchased more than 100,000 jin. The Huanggang Xinzhou business office responded to the call of its superiors by organizing mobile purchasing teams to go deep into rural areas to persuade and mobilize people, spreading the word from village to village and household to household, encouraging farmers to sell cotton. They purchased more than 1,000 jin in the past four or five days. The Fancheng branch, in conjunction with local Party and government forces, negotiated the purchase of local financial tax cotton and cotton stored by public institutions. They adopted a purchase system that allowed price increases but not decreases, dispelling the concerns of cotton-storing institutions about losing money. At the same time, they simplified import procedures and took care of the other party's concerns about weighing losses and transportation difficulties, so most cotton-storing institutions were willing to sell cotton to the company. The Zhaoyang branch of the company purchased more than 5,000 dan of local grain and cotton. Warehouses, banks, troops, and other institutions in Xiangyang also sold more than 1,000 dan to the company one after another. Several thousand dan of cotton stored in Jingshan, Tianmen, Yuekou, Xuhuang, Zaoshi, and other places were also all purchased after the Jingzhou Prefectural Office telegraphed the finance committees of various counties to sell all the stored cotton to local branches. In addition, the Zhaoyang branch entrusted cooperatives to conduct purchasing on its behalf, and the Suixian Lishan cotton and textile branch established a purchasing relationship with the cotton exchange, organizing and assisting cotton peddlers in purchasing, all of which achieved certain results.

However, in the purchasing process, the improper handling of prices affected the results that should have been achieved. For example, in May, the cotton-grain price ratio in Fancheng was 1:6.81; in Lishan it was 1:6.79; and in other areas, it also did not meet the standards set by the central government. Some of the cotton in northern Hubei went to Henan. These issues must be paid attention to in future purchases.

　　湖北各地花纱布公司想各种办法收购存棉
    湖北省国营花纱布公司各地分、支机构，五、六月间以多种多样办法开展收购棉花工作。荆州、黄冈、襄阳等专区的花纱布公司，只从六月四日到十五日左右已收购了棉花八十多万斤。天门分公司组织流动收购组，深入农村，一方面与土地改革工作队结合进行宣传，打破棉农顾虑；另一方面发动农会以村为单位，成立收购组，由乡长和农会主席分任正副组长，直接向农民劝售。这样，五月上半月共收购了二万五千斤左右。到六月中旬共收购了十万多斤。黄冈新洲营业所响应上级号召，组织了流动收购小组，深入农村，说服动员，村传村，户传户，鼓励农民出售棉花，最近四、五天收购了一千多斤。樊城分公司结合地方党政力量，进行洽购当地财政赋棉，和公营机关存棉。采取听涨不听跌的赊购办法，打消了存棉机关怕赔钱的思想顾虑。同时简化进货手续，照顾对方赔秤，及运输上的困难，大部分存棉机关都愿意将棉花卖给该公司。该公司所属枣阳支公司洽购了地方粮棉五千多担。襄阳各仓库、银行、部队等机关也先后售给该公司一千多担。京山、天门、岳口、徐黄、皂市等地存棉共几千担，经过荆州专署电饬各县财委将所存棉花全部卖给当地分、支机构后，也全部收购了。此外，枣阳支公司委托合作社进行代购，随县厉山花纱布支公司与棉花交易行建立代购关系，组织和帮助花贩进行收购，都收到一定效果。
    但是，在收购中，由于价格掌握上不够合理，影响了应得的成绩。如在五月份中，樊城的棉粮比价为一比六·八一；厉山为一比六·七九；其他地区亦多不合乎中央规定的标准。鄂北的棉花，有一部分走向河南去了。这些须要在今后收购中注意掌握。
