　　Soviet Union Uses Airplanes to Spray Chemicals to Eradicate Weeds in Fields
    (Xinhua News Agency, Stalingrad, 20th dispatch via TASS) This year, the Soviet Union is using airplanes to spray chemicals in the Volga region to eradicate weeds in grain and industrial crop areas, with great results. Airplanes flying low over the fields spray the Soviet Union's newly invented herbicide "Gerbitsid". After spraying, weeds wither and die from the roots within two or three days, while crops are completely unaffected. One airplane can clear weeds on more than 80 to 100 hectares per day. Several thousand hectares of grain have now been sprayed. This invention, which won a Stalin Prize, will be widely used in agriculture.

　　苏联用飞机喷射药剂铲除田间杂草
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社斯大林格勒二十日讯：今年苏联在伏尔加州使用飞机喷射药剂，铲除谷物和工业作物地区的杂草，收效很大。掠地飞行的飞机在田野上喷射苏联新发明的除草液体“格比西得”，喷射后杂草在两三天之内便连根枯死，农作物则完全不受损害。一架飞机每天可以除草八十到一百公顷以上，现在已有几千公顷的谷物经过喷射。这一发明曾获得了斯大林奖金，在农业中将广泛利用。
