Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 2nd: The local autonomous government elections were held on May 27th in twenty-eight industrialized provinces in northern Italy. The election results prove that the strength of the People's Front, led by the Italian Communist Party, is even greater than it was during the 1948 parliamentary elections; while the strength of the Christian Democratic Party, the loyal lackey of American imperialism, has greatly weakened.

According to TASS's Rome dispatch, based on the results of the elections for the political and municipal committees of the twenty-seven provinces that have been published, the coalition of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and progressive elements received 3,072,000 votes, accounting for 36.3 percent of all votes, compared to only 30.8 percent of the votes in the 1948 parliamentary elections; the ruling party bloc headed by the Christian Democratic Party received 58.6 percent of the votes, compared to 62.7 percent in 1948. In 1948, the Christian Democratic Party, without the help of friendly parties, independently obtained 4,631,000 votes, accounting for 49.3 percent of all votes; but now it has only obtained 3,478,000 votes, accounting for 41.1 percent of all votes, which means it has lost 1,153,000 votes. The Italian Communist Party's "l'Unità" pointed out: "In every provincial capital and every important city, the Christian Democratic Party has suffered serious losses compared to 1948." In this "anti-communist election" that American imperialism meticulously orchestrated, the failure of the Italian reactionaries was so obvious that the New York "Daily News" could not help but exclaim: "The election results are chilling to those who worship the Marshall Plan. ...The fact is that the Marshall Plan has stubbed its toes in the Italian elections, which happened after spending more than $1 billion to buy off the Italian people in thirty months."

The Italian reactionaries had long anticipated the possibility of their failure in the election, so they forced the parliament to pass undemocratic election laws in advance. According to this election law, various reactionary parties could form alliances to hunt for a majority of votes in each constituency, and two-thirds or four-fifths of the seats on the provincial (municipal) committees must belong to the party that obtains the majority; only the remaining one-third or one-fifth is allocated according to the proportion of votes. Relying on this despicable conspiracy, the reactionary faction, which was obviously defeated in this election, usurped some of the provincial (municipal) committees that were originally dominated by democratic forces. However, the People's Front still won unprecedented victories in the provincial (municipal) committees of many provinces (cities) in the Marches and Venice regions.

"l'Unità" pointed out: This election has clearly proved that the People's Front, which was formed in the April 18, 1948 election, still exists, is active, and is developing in Italy. The achievements of the People's Front were obtained in the struggle against the ruling party alliance, despite the oppression of the brutal anti-communist regime for four years. The People's Front is so strong that neither manipulating and revising election laws nor forming party alliances can prevent the banner of the people from flying on the rooftops of hundreds of municipal committees such as Bologna, Savona, and Mantua.

The Italian people are cheering and celebrating their own victory. As soon as the news of the victory of the democratic forces in Bologna, a large industrial city in northern Italy, was spread, the people of Bologna gathered in groups in front of the city hall, cheering for the Communist Mayor Dozza and applauding for a long time in response to the congratulatory telegram from the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti. The celebrations continued late into the night.

The local autonomous government elections in Italy will continue on the two Sundays of June 3rd and 10th.

　　意大利北部地方选举结果证明
    意人民阵线力量增强 
    美国奴仆基督教民主党力量益削弱
    【新华社二日讯】罗马消息：意大利北部工业发达的二十八个省，在五月二十七日举行地方自治政权机构的选举。选举结果证明：以意大利共产党为首的人民阵线的力量，已比一九四八年议会选举时更加壮大；而作为美帝国主义忠实奴仆的基督教民主党的力量，却大大削弱了。
    据塔斯社罗马消息，根据已经发表的二十七个省政、市政委员会选举的结果，共产党，社会党和进步分子的联盟得到三百零七万二千票，占全部选票百分之三十六点三，而一九四八年议会选举时还只得到选票百分之三十点八；以基督教民主党为首的政府党集团得到选票百分之五十八点六，而一九四八年却得到百分之六十二点七。在一九四八年，基督教民主党不靠友党的帮助，独得全部选票百分之四十九点三，共四百六十三万一千票；但是现在它只得到了全部选票百分之四十一点一，共三百四十七万八千票，也就是丧失了一百一十五万三千票。意共“团结报”指出：“在每一个省会，每一个重要城市中，比起一九四八年来，基督教民主党都受到严重损失。”在美帝国主义所处心积虑地布置起来的这次“反共选举”中，意大利反动派的失败是这样明显，使得纽约“每日新闻”不禁失声惊呼：“选举结果真使崇奉马歇尔计划的人寒心。……事实是马歇尔计划在意大利的选举中碰伤了自己的脚趾，这是在三十个月来花去十亿多美元收买意大利人民之后发生的。”
    意大利反动派早就预感到了他们在选举中失败的可能性，因此事先就强迫议会通过了反民主的选举法。根据这个选举法，各反动党派可以结成联盟在各选区猎取多数选票，而各省（市）政委员会席次的三分之二或五分之四须归属得到多数的党派，只有剩余的三分之一或五分之一才按选票比例分配。依靠着这个卑劣的阴谋，在这次选举中显然惨败的反动派，虽然篡窃了一些原来为民主力量占优势的省（市）政委员会。但是人民阵线仍在马彻斯和威尼斯两区许多省（市）政委员中获得从来没有的胜利。
    《团结报》指出：这次选举已清楚地证明：一九四八年四月十八日选举中所组成的人民阵线，依然在意大利存在着、活动着、向前发展着。人民阵线的这种成就是在反对执政党派联盟的斗争中，不顾四年来恣肆暴戾的反共政权的压迫而获得的。人民阵线已如此强大，以致无论操纵修改选举法和结成党派联盟，都不能阻止人民的旗帜飘扬在波伦亚、萨窝那、孟都亚等好几百个市政委员会的房顶上。
    意大利人民都为他们自己的胜利欢呼庆祝。民主力量在意大利北部的工业大城市波伦亚获得胜利的消息一传出来，波伦亚人民就成群结队地聚集在市政厅面前，向市长共产党人杜萨欢呼，向意共总书记托里亚蒂发来的贺电长时间地欢呼鼓掌。人们的庆祝一直继续到深夜。
    意大利地方自治政权机构的选举，将在六月三日和十日两个星期日继续举行。
