　  Review of the Collapse Incident That Killed Workers

    To the Editor:
    Our company's Materials Department, Beijiao Brick Kiln Factory, experienced an unfortunate incident on May 29th when a newly built tile-drying shed collapsed, killing and injuring workers. The People's Daily published an account of this incident on June 12th and made serious criticisms of us. We must continue to examine this matter.
    After the accident, we took a series of measures, which are briefly reported as follows:
    On the day the incident occurred, the company's supervisor, personnel section chief, union chairman, and the director and deputy director of the materials department immediately rushed to the scene to organize the rescue. They worked through the night to concentrate all efforts on settling matters for the deceased and injured. Starting the next day (May 30th), the company's Party organization, administrative, and trade union leaders conducted separate inspections to investigate responsibility. Both General Manager Li Gongxia, Manager Zhong Sen, Supervisor Zhang Ruoping, and Deputy Manager Cui Yancai personally went to the site to investigate. They reported to the Municipal People's Government and invited the Municipal People's Court, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and other units to discuss the aftermath. On May 31st, June 1st, and 2nd, various meetings were held continuously to conduct reviews, investigations, and research without interruption. After receiving our report, the responsible comrades of the Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China went to the scene to inspect and urged us to investigate responsibility. On June 7th, Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal People's Government, convened responsible persons from the Municipal People's Supervision Committee, the Municipal People's Court, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Construction Bureau, and other units to discuss the handling of the matter.
    Therefore, after the incident occurred, we attached great importance to this serious problem. Qian Zhengrong, deputy director of the Beijiao Brick Kiln Factory, who was directly responsible for the incident, has been dismissed and sent to the People's Court for handling. On the company leadership side, the subjective reasons for the accident were the failure to take precautions, lack of inspection of work, insufficient education of cadres, and attention to the safety of large buildings while neglecting smaller projects. Objectively, the company suffered from a shortage of cadres, leading to neglect of one area while attending to another. For example, on May 29th, due to continuous heavy rain, the company leadership had paid attention to the safety of various construction sites. Manager Zhong Sen and Supervisor Zhang Ruoping went to Haiyuncang Cangjiaodao, Liuli Men, and other construction sites to inspect and instructed relevant departments and construction teams to conduct strict inspections via telephone. No one went to the Materials Department's Beijiao Brick Kiln Factory, and the unfortunate incident occurred at 5:45 p.m. that day.
    For this reason, the company's leading cadres have requested punishment from the Municipal People's Government and have accepted the painful lesson of this incident. Meetings have been held to conduct a comprehensive review and prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
    Your criticism is a great education for all personnel in our company and will greatly help improve our future work. We are very grateful.

### 北京市永茂建筑公司检查塌房砸死工人事件

　  检查塌房砸死工人事件编辑同志：
    本公司材料部北郊砖窑厂于五月二十九日发生新建晾瓦棚倒塌砸死、砸伤工人的不幸事件。人民日报在六月十二日发表了这一事件的经过，并对我们提出了严正的批评。对此，我们是应该继续加以检讨的。
    事故发生后，我们曾进行了一系列的措施，现在简要报告如下：
    事情发生的当天，公司监理、人事科长、工会主席、材料部正副主任等当即赶赴现场，组织抢救，星夜集中全力安置死者及受伤人员。第二天（五月三十日）起，公司党组织、行政、工会领导干部即分别进行检查，追究责任。兼总经理李公侠、经理钟森、监理张若平、副理崔彦彩等都亲赴现场勘察，一面报告了市人民政府，一面约请市人民法院、市劳动局、市总工会等单位会商善后处置。五月三十一日、六月一日、二日，连续召开各种会议，进行检讨、调查、研究，迄未中断。市人民政府、中共北京市委在接获我们的报告后，负责同志一面亲赴现场视察，一面严厉督促我们检查责任。六月七日，市人民政府薛子正秘书长邀集市人民监察委员会、市人民法院、市劳动局、市公安局、市建设局等单位负责人员会商处理办法。
    因此，在事件发生后，我们是重视了这一严重问题的。事件的直接负责者北郊砖窑厂副厂长钱正荣已撤职送人民法院处理。在公司领导方面，事先疏于防范，对工作缺乏检查，对干部领导教育不够，对工程的安全问题只注意了大的建筑而忽视了一些较小的工程，这也是发生事故的主观原因。在客观原因上，则是公司干部不足，顾此失彼。比如在五月二十九日，因连日急雨，公司领导上对各工地安全已引起注意，经理钟森、监理张若平曾于当日冒雨分赴海运仓仓夹道、琉璃门等工地作了检查，并以电话令各有关部门及工程队进行严格检查。材料部北郊砖窑厂没有人去，不幸事件就在当天下午五时三刻发生了。
    为此，公司领导干部已向市人民政府自请处分，并接受这次事件的惨痛教训，召开了会议，进行全面检查，杜绝此类事件的重复发生。
    你们的批评，对我们公司所有的人员都是一个很大的教育，对我们今后工作的改进大有帮助，我们很是感谢。        北京市公营永茂建筑公司
