　　Running a Cooperative Should Fully Meet the Needs of Members
　　——The Successful Experience of the Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative
　　　　　　　　　　Li Zhuo
　　The Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine's workers' consumer cooperative is a consumer cooperative organized in an area where workers live in concentrated numbers. The experience of the two years since its establishment proves that only by constantly making workers experience the benefits of being organized, only by fully meeting the needs of members, and only by doing a good job in democratic management can the cooperative establish a reputation among the masses and can the cooperative's business be developed. As the workers say, "If the cooperative works for us, we will support the cooperative."

　　Making Workers Experience the Benefits of the Cooperative
　　In the two years since the establishment of the Tangshan Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative, it has experienced many struggles. These struggles have all safeguarded the economic interests of the workers. Therefore, the workers deeply appreciate the benefits of the cooperative. Coupled with organization and publicity work, the cooperative has developed rapidly. Here is a very vivid example.
　　At the end of the lunar year in 1949, the Kailuan Mining Bureau paid the workers' bonuses in the form of coal tickets. The coal tickets of more than 11,000 workers in Tangshan Mine were a huge number and there was no way to dispose of them for a time. The workers were also anxious to sell their coal tickets to buy goods for the New Year. At this time, coal dealers in the market took the opportunity to force the price of a ton of coal tickets down to 96,000 yuan. To protect the interests of the workers, the Tangshan Mine Workers' Coal Station (the predecessor of the Workers' Consumer Cooperative) immediately purchased them at 111,000 yuan per ton. Four days later, the coal dealers tried to play other tricks, but they were suppressed by the coal station supported by the masses. During the New Year holiday, workers talked about the coal ticket incident before the New Year, saying, "Thanks to the coal station, we were able to buy several more pecks of grain for a ton of coal tickets." When work resumed the following year, the workers automatically joined the cooperative (coal station). As a result, the cooperative's business was developed, and the coal station gradually developed into a regular workers' consumer cooperative. Now, the cooperative has more than 900 million yuan in funds, and about 88 percent of the workers in the mine have joined the cooperative.

　　Fully Meeting the Needs of Members
　　The cooperative also took some detours in its operation. The main reason was that some cadres made the mistake of simply pursuing high profits. They were unwilling to do things with small profits, and rushed to do things with large profits, lacking a complete view of serving the members. For example, last autumn, many members (especially workers) asked the cooperative to supply new coarse grains. The profit margin for grain was very small, and it had to be purchased in the countryside. Some cadres said, "There is no profit in running around, and it is better to do less than to do more." Because of these ideological problems, they were indifferent to members who bought grain, and the business shrank in a few days. Immediately afterwards, the work of rectifying the cooperative began, and everyone raised this issue, widely collecting members' opinions on the cooperative. The members unanimously demanded that the cooperative make it convenient, cheap, reliable, and comprehensive to buy goods. The cooperative used these mass opinions as the standard for rectifying the cooperative and studied how to fully meet the needs of the members.
　　The workers of Tangshan Mine live in concentrated numbers in Northwest Well and Nanfuzhuang. The cooperative set up branches in these two places, so that members do not have to run too far to buy things. Workers only have time after work, so the cooperative's business hours are extended to ten and a half hours. In the three days after the payment of wages, the cooperative reduces the prices of department stores, grain, and cotton textiles for three days, and extends the business hours by one hour, so that members can buy more things. The cooperative also tries to expand its business scope, including oil department, grocery department, department store department, cotton textile department, canteen, vegetable, fish and meat department (being established), coal station, barber shop, sewing department, and pastry department; there are more than 700 kinds of goods. Because of various methods to fully meet the needs of members, the business has been greatly developed. In May of this year, the business volume of the Tangshan Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative accounted for 54 percent of the May wages of the Tangshan Mine members. Compared with the prices on the market, the cooperative saved its members 95 million yuan in May.

　　Democratically Managing the Cooperative
　　To run the cooperative well, it is necessary to act in accordance with the opinions of the masses. In order to mobilize all members to supervise the cooperative, it is very important to regularly and systematically collect members' opinions on the cooperative. The Tangshan Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative has three ways of soliciting members' opinions: 1. Before the opening of the members' representative meeting, widely distribute the "Opinion Solicitation Form" and ask the members to fill it out and hand it over to the cooperative. 2. Set up a "Members' Opinion Book" in the business department, where members can write down their opinions at any time, and the opinions are sorted out on time. 3. Organize a work team to conduct "typical investigations" in the homes of members to investigate the income and expenditure situation of the members, the needs of the members, and the opinions of the members on the cooperative.
　　Some members once expressed their opinions on the congestion in the cooperative's business department when buying goods, and pointed out that this problem was due to the excessively complicated procedures in the business department when selling goods. The cooperative accepted the members' opinions and changed the original complicated procedures for members to buy goods, where they first had to issue a ticket, then take the ticket to the payment office to pay, stamp it, and fold it back to pick up the goods, to a system where the salesperson is responsible for the goods. Members buy goods, pay immediately, and pick up the goods, eliminating many complicated procedures in the middle. The members are very satisfied.
　　The meeting system of the Tangshan Mine Consumer Cooperative is well maintained, and it is also a reason why it can implement democratic management. They pay attention to actually solving problems when they hold meetings, can prepare fully in advance, and can thoroughly implement afterwards. The member groups are combined with the trade union groups, making it convenient to convene meetings and maintain daily contact.

　　办合作社要充分满足社员的需要
    ——开滦唐山煤矿职工消费合作社办好的经验
           李卓
    开滦唐山煤矿的职工消费合作社，是在工人集中居住地区组织起来的消费合作社。建社二年的经验证明：只有不断地使工人体验到组织起来的好处，只有充分满足社员的需要，只有做好民主管理工作，合作社才能在群众中建立信誉，合作社的业务才能开展。正如工人所说：“合作社为咱办事，咱就拥护合作社。”
  使工人体验到合作社的好处
    唐山矿职工消费合作社建社以来的二年中，经历了许多次的斗争。这些斗争，都维护了职工的经济利益。因此，职工群众深切体会到合作社的好处。再加上组织和宣传工作，合作社就迅速发展起来。这里有一个极生动的例子。
    一九四九年农历年底，开滦矿务局给工人开支的红利是煤票。唐山矿一万一千多职工的煤票，是一个极大的数目，一时没有出路。而工人又迫切地要求卖掉煤票来办年货。这时市上煤贩便乘机硬把一吨煤的煤票价压到九万六千元。唐山矿职工煤栈（职工消费合作社的前身）为维护职工利益，即以十一万一吨的价格收进。四天以后，煤贩子又想玩弄别的手段，终被群众所支持的煤栈压了下去。过年工人歇班，说起年前煤票的事，都说：“多亏有煤栈，一吨煤票多吃好几斗粮食。”第二年开工，职工都自动加入了合作社（煤栈）。合作社业务因此得到开展，煤栈逐渐发展成为正规的职工消费合作社。到现在，该合作社已有资金九亿多元，全矿约有百分之八十八以上的职工加入合作社。
  充分满足社员的需要
    合作社经营过程中也走了些弯路。主要是某些干部犯了单纯追逐高额利润的错误。利小的不愿做，利大的争着做，缺乏完整的为社员服务的观点。比如去年秋季，许多社员（特别是工人）要求合作社供给新的粗粮。粮食的利润规定得很薄，又须到乡间去采购，一些干部便表示：“东奔西走没有利，多一事不如少一事。”因为思想上有这些毛病，对买粮食的社员表现冷淡，不上几天，业务就萎缩了。紧接着，整顿合作社的工作开始了，大家把这个问题提出来，广泛地搜集社员对合作社的意见。社员一致要求合作社作到买货方便，便宜，货实，货全。合作社就以这些群众意见作为整社的标准，研究了怎样充分满足社员的需要。
    唐山矿的工人集中居住在西北井和南富庄，合作社就在这两处设立支社，使社员买东西不需要跑得老远。工人必须在下班后才有工夫，所以合作社的营业时间延长到十个半小时。发工资后的三天中，合作社不论百货、粮食、棉织，都减价三天，还延长营业时间一小时，使社员可以多买些东西。合作社又尽量扩大业务范围，计有油部、杂货部、百货部、棉织部、食堂、青菜鱼肉部（正在办）、煤栈、理发部、缝纫部、糕点部；货样有七百多种。由于用各种办法充分满足了社员需要，业务就有很大的开展。今年五月份，唐山矿职工消费合作社的营业额占唐山矿社员五月份工资的百分之五十四。如果与市上价格比较，五月份该社给社员省了九千五百万元。
  民主管理合作社
    要搞好合作社，必须依照群众的意见办事。为了动员全体社员来督促合作社，经常地有组织地搜集社员对合作社的意见是很重要的。唐山矿职工消费合作社征求社员意见的方式有三种：一、开社员代表大会以前，普遍印发《征求意见书》，请社员填好交给合作社。二、在营业部门设《社员意见本》，社员有意见随时写上去，按时把意见整理出来。三、组织工作组到社员家里做“典型调查”，调查社员的收支情形、需求情形和对合作社的意见。
    曾经有社员对合作社营业部购买货物时的拥挤现象提出意见，并指出这个毛病是营业部在销货时手续过分复杂的缘故。合作社接受了社员的意见，把原先社员买物品时先开传票，社员拿了传票到交款处交了款，盖好章，折回来取货的繁复手续，改为售货员货物负责制，社员买了货物，当即交钱取货，免去中间许多复杂的手续。社员都很满意。
    唐山矿消费合作社的会议制度坚持得很好，也是能贯彻民主管理的一个原因。他们开会时很注意实际解决的问题，事先能充分准备，事后能彻底执行。社员小组与工会小组结合着编，使召集会议和日常联系都很方便。
