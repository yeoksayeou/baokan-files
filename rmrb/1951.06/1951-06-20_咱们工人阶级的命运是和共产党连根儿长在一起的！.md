　　Our working class's fate is intertwined with the Communist Party!
　　Oral account by Sun Yugui, an old worker at the Beijing Trolleybus Repair Factory.
　　The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party is approaching, and everyone is preparing to celebrate. When I think of the inhuman days of the past, and compare them with the joyful new life now, I just want to shout: Communist Party! Chairman Mao! Just like sunflowers follow the sun, I, Old Sun, will always follow you!
　　I am an old repairman at the Beijing Trolleybus Repair Factory. In the old society, I was oppressed and exploited for most of my life. Since the Communist Party and Chairman Mao entered the city, my life has changed.
　　However, my old brain wasn't so clear at the beginning! In the spring of 1949, when Beijing was just liberated, I still had a skeptical attitude towards my own Party—the Communist Party. At that time, everyone said, "The Communist Party is working for the welfare of the people," but I grumbled in my heart: Weren't the Nationalists always saying this kind of nonsense? Welfare has to be in hand to count. In the past two years, a series of fresh events have gradually educated me. In 1949, in order to celebrate the first Labor Day after liberation, all the workers in our factory worked day and night to produce dozens of trolleybuses, but they were burned by counter-revolutionaries. At that time, I thought: My rice bowl is smashed, it's over! I'll go home and prepare to do something else tomorrow. Who would have thought that the People's Government would immediately provide loans to the factory to rebuild new cars, and even better ones. This incident immediately reminded me of the situation in which the reactionary government had devastated the trolleybus company in the past. At that time, the warlord bureaucrats occupied the trolleybus company, sucking the blood of the workers to fatten themselves. As for the company's business and the workers' life and death, the bad guys didn't care at all. In those years, they ran as many cars as they had, and those that couldn't run were thrown in the parking lot, left to the wind and rain. At that time, the puppet mayor of Beijing put the citizens' cleaning fees into his own pocket, but stubbornly used trolleybuses to pull dirt. Compared with the situation of the People's Government building enterprises under the leadership of the Communist Party today, it is really a world of difference. This incident began to move my heart and change my understanding of the Communist Party.
　　Thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party, prices no longer somersaulted. The factory's production was successful, and the workers' lives were significantly improved. My eldest son and I can earn more than 800 catties of millet per month, and the gaunt faces of our family have become rosy. The current situation is that we have enough to eat, wear, and have some left over. Of course, we work with extra vigor. One night, after the closing bell had rung, I was still rushing to finish the last batch of work. Manager Wang of the company came in and asked warmly, "Old Sun, why are you in such a hurry? Be careful of getting hurt!" I said, "The oil is no good, it's not easy to use, it's slowing down the work!" The manager immediately said, "Quickly let the material warehouse change it for a good one." Then he asked kindly about this and that. When I returned home that day, I couldn't sleep. I thought: I've been an apprentice since I was fifteen years old, and this is the first time I've seen a manager treat a worker so considerately. When I was an apprentice, I had to give someone a deed of indenture, which stated: "The apprentice's drowning or falling into a well is not the responsibility of the factory or the master." At that time, as an apprentice, I had to endure beatings and scoldings. Even if I was beaten to death, I was just a piece of stinking ground. I finally struggled with blood and tears to "complete my apprenticeship," but what then? I worked in the factory during the day and pulled a rickshaw at night, and the money I earned wasn't enough to eat "Republican flour." My family was so hungry that we had no way out. We wanted to borrow some money from the factory, but the factory director glared and said, "Get out! The company doesn't have this regulation!" If the Communist Party and Chairman Mao hadn't come, where would there be an end to this suffering? Even if we don't have enough awareness, we know to turn our hearts towards Chairman Mao!
　　One evening at the end of February this year, I returned home after work and was listening to the radio broadcast. My eldest son, who worked with me, rushed in and said to me, "Dad, big news!" I thought, where did the big news come from? My eldest son said: The Central People's Government has promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, and the company has decided that some elderly employees can enjoy old-age subsidies. Tomorrow, I will go to the company to participate in the Respect for the Elderly Conference. Sure enough, the next day, I put on a big red flower amidst the respectful applause of everyone. From then on, I could receive 20 percent of my original salary each month as an on-the-job pension subsidy. It's really an unprecedented thing. In the era of warlord and bureaucratic rule, some old workers with failing eyesight, stiff legs, and inflexible hands were kicked out of the factory and ignored. How could it be like today, when they are old, they are glorious!
　　Through the education of these facts, I have thoroughly realized that the fate of our working class is intertwined with the Communist Party. For the past thirty years, the Communist Party has sacrificed the lives of countless martyrs in order to win the liberation of the working people. Now that we are liberated, our working class should contribute all its strength to increase production, defend the fruits of the revolution, and defend our new China.

### 咱们工人阶级的命运是和共产党连根儿长在一起的！

　　咱们工人阶级的命运是和共产党连根儿长在一起的！
    北京电车修造厂老工人　孙玉贵口述
    中国共产党成立三十周年纪念日快到了，大家都在准备庆祝。我想起以往那些不是人过的日子，比比眼下乐融融的新生活，我只想大声喊：共产党！毛主席！葵花跟着太阳转，咱老孙永远跟着您！
    我是北京电车修造厂的老检修工。在旧社会里，我整整被压迫、剥削了大半辈子。自从共产党和毛主席进了城，我的生活才变了样子。
    可是，我这老脑筋并不是一开头就这样清醒呀！一九四九年春天北京刚解放时，我对自己的党——共产党，还抱着一种怀疑的态度。那时大伙说：“共产党是为人民谋福利的”，我心里可嘀咕着：往日国民党还不是尽说这类瞎话。福利，非得拿到手里才成呀。两年来，一连串新鲜的事件，逐渐地教育了我。在一九四九年，为了庆祝解放后的第一个劳动节，我们全厂工人起早摸黑，赶出了几十辆电车，却给反革命分子一把火烧掉了。那时候，我心里想：饭碗砸了，这下完了！赶明儿回家准备干别的吧。谁想到人民政府马上贷款给工厂，要重造新车，而且要造的更好。这件事，使我立刻回想起过去反动政府摧残电车公司的情形来了。那时的军阀官僚，霸住电车公司，喝工人的血来养肥他们自己。至于公司的营业和工人的死活，坏家伙们是一概不理的。那年头，有几辆车出几辆车，跑不动的就扔在停车场里，任凭风吹雨打。当时北京伪市长把市民的清洁费都装进自己的腰包，却硬用电车去拉脏土。这和今天在共产党领导下的人民政府建设企业的情形比较起来，真是天上差到地下了。这件事开始打动了我的心，转变了我对共产党的认识。
    由于共产党领导得好，物价不再翻跟斗了。工厂生产搞得有成绩，工人的生活得到显著的改善。我和我的大儿子，每月能挣八百多斤小米，一家大小的瘦脸变成满面红光。现在的光景已经是有吃有穿有剩了。当然，我们干起活来就特别有劲了。有天夜里，已经过了下班的钟点，我还在赶最后一批活。公司的王经理进来，亲热地问道：“老孙，干吗这样着急？留心碰着呀！”我说：“机油不行，使起来不得劲，把活拖下来啦！”经理马上说：“赶紧让材料库换好使的。”接着又和气地问这说那。当天回到家里，我怎么也睡不着。我想：我从十五岁当学徒，这是第一回看见经理这样体贴工人，我当初当学徒，要给人立一张卖身字据，上面写着：“徒弟投河下井，概与厂方师傅无干。”那时候我当学徒的要挨得起打和骂，打死了也不过是臭一块地。我好容易一把血一把泪熬到“出师”，可是又怎样呢？白天在厂里干活，晚上拉洋车，挣的钱还不够吃“共和面”。我一家人饿得没办法，想在厂里借点钱，厂长一瞪眼，说：“滚！公司没这个规章！”不是来了共产党毛主席，这个苦那里有尽头？就算咱觉悟不够，也懂得把心眼向着毛主席呀！
    今年二月末一个晚上，我干完活回到家里，正在听无线电广播。跟我在一起干活的大儿子呼的一声窜进来，冲着我说：“爹，大喜事！”我想，又那里来的大喜事呀？大儿子说：中央人民政府颁布了劳动保险条例，公司决定一些年老的职工可以享受养老补助费，明天要我到公司参加敬老会。果然，第二天我便在大伙尊敬的掌声中，带上了大红花。从此以后，我每月可以领到原工资百分之二十的在职养老补助金。真是破天荒的事。在军阀官僚统治的年代，一些眼花、腿硬、手不灵活的老工人，被踢出厂外就不管了，那里会象今天这样，老了反而光荣呢！
    经过了这些事实的教育，我彻底认清了咱工人阶级的命运，是和共产党连根儿长在一起的。共产党三十年来为了争取劳动人民的解放，曾经有无数先烈牺牲了生命。现在解放了，我们工人阶级应该贡献出自己所有的力量，增加生产，保卫革命果实，保卫咱们的新中国。
