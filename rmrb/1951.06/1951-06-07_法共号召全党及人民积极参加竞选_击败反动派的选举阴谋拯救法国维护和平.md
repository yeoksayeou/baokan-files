　　French Communist Party Calls on All Party Members and People to Actively Participate in the Election
    Defeat the Reactionary Election Conspiracy, Save France, and Maintain Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 5th] According to TASS, Paris, the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party held a meeting on May 25th, presided over by Duclos, and passed a resolution on "The Struggle for Peace and the Election Campaign."
    The resolution first emphasized: The movement to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's Peace Pact declaration has begun. Various regions continue to actively nominate many representatives to participate in the July 14th Peace Demonstration and the July 15th All-France Peace Congress. This ensures that this day of peace struggle will surely be victorious.
    The resolution then stated: Communists, working people, and democrats are participating in the election campaign with great enthusiasm, and will do everything possible to shatter the war-mongers' conspiracy to force us to accept poverty, fascism, and a policy of war. More and more committees to protect universal suffrage and election committees are uniting French people of various views in factories, cities, and villages. The election fund-raising campaign has achieved unprecedented success nationwide, which shows how much the urban and rural working people care about the Communist Party's activities to guarantee bread, freedom, and peace. All upright citizens condemn the despicable alliance formed by all reactionary forces from the Socialist Party to de Gaulle's French People's Rally. Communists and party organizations at all levels must strengthen the movement against this alliance and ruthlessly expose the two-faced tactics of these despicable politicians.
    The resolution finally pointed out: The war-mongers in Washington will believe that voting for the candidates of the ruling parties and the French People's Rally means supporting the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and supporting the policies of creating war and poverty. The French Communist Party, united with the working people of the Socialist Party and extending a hand of friendship to the Catholic working people, calls on all good men and women in France to unite and vote for the candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance to save France and maintain peace.

　　法共号召全党及人民积极参加竞选
    击败反动派的选举阴谋拯救法国维护和平
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯，法国共产党政治局五月二十五日在杜克洛主持下举行会议，通过了关于“争取和平的斗争与竞选运动”的决议。
    决议首先着重指出：为世界和平理事会和平公约宣言征集签名的运动已经展开。各地都继续积极推选许多代表参加七月十四日和平大示威与七月十五日全法和平大会。这就保证了这个和平斗争日一定能获得胜利。
    决议接着说：共产党人、劳动人民和民主分子都以极大的热情参加竞选运动，要尽一切力量去粉碎战争贩子强使我们接受贫穷、法西斯主义和战争政策的阴谋。把工厂、城市和乡村中各种见解的法国人团结起来的保护普选委员会和选举委员会越来越多了。竞选基金募捐运动在全国达到了空前的成就，这说明城乡劳动人民是怎样关心共产党保障面包、自由与和平的活动。一切正直的公民都谴责从社会党到戴高乐的法兰西人民联盟这一切反动力量结成联盟的卑鄙阴谋。共产党员和各级党组织必须加强反对这种联盟的运动，并无情地揭露这批卑鄙的政客们所耍的两面手法。
    决议最后指出：华盛顿的战争贩子们将认为：投票选举各执政党派和法兰西人民联盟的候选人，就是拥护马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约，就是拥护制造战争和贫穷的政策。和社会党的劳动人民团结一致、向信奉天主教的劳动人民伸出友谊之手的法国共产党，号召法国全体善良男女团结起来，投票选举共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人，来拯救法国，维护和平。
