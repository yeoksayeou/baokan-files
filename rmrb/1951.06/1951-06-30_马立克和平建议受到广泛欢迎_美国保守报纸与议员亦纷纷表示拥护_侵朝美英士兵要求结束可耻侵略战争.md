Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, TASS New York dispatch: According to newspaper reports, United Nations General Assembly President, Mr. Eelco van Kleffens, told reporters that, due to Malik's proposal, he has "great hope" for ending the Korean War.

*New York Times* reporter, Hamiliden, said that the majority of United Nations representatives "believe that the Soviet proposal should be thoroughly studied."

*Compass Daily* reporter, Edel, citing "qualified sources," pointed out that Malik's proposal obviously "changed the situation" in favor of peace.

The *Journal of Commerce* commented that the cessation of the Korean conflict might lead the U.S. Congress to extend the duration of mobilization and expansion plans, which would be equivalent to saying that profits would decrease and create fear of "a fairly serious business recession in the next two or three years."

However, despite official expressions of fear and caution, Malik's proposal has elicited the broadest positive response, even among conservatives who typically support government plans. According to an Associated Press correspondent in Washington, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally told reporters: "Malik's proposal should receive careful and appropriate consideration."

Another member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator George of Georgia, also advocated that the United States study the matter.

The *Compass Daily* published an editorial calling for the prompt acceptance of Malik's proposal. The editorial said: "We can only have one attitude toward the proposal put forward by Malik over the weekend as the first step toward peace in Korea, and that is to accept it."

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The proposal made by the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, on June 23rd, for a peaceful resolution to the Korean question, has been universally supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and has aroused strong reactions among soldiers in the American and British armies invading Korea. These soldiers are demanding an immediate end to this unpopular war of aggression. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 24th: When the news of Malik's peace proposal reached the Korean front, "it exploded among the soldiers who heard the developments like a small atomic bomb." Soldiers in the American invading forces were "all jubilant and overjoyed." "Everyone is eagerly looking forward to the end of the Korean War." A U.S. Army sergeant who was busy repairing telephone lines immediately climbed down from the telephone pole when he heard the news and said: "That's the best thing, now we can go home." A U.S. Army corporal said to another American soldier: "You stop doing what you're doing. The damned war is over." Another American soldier said: "I hope we accept this proposal." "It's the best news I've ever heard." According to a Reuters dispatch on the 24th: Many American "officers and men expressed hope that this seemingly endless war might finally be resolved and that they might get a chance to leave a country that means only death and destruction to them."

The situation is even more so among soldiers in the British army. According to another Associated Press dispatch on the 24th: "The frontline Commonwealth forces did not hear the radio broadcast of Malik's peace proposal, and they are checking the news today with great hope." The dispatch said "British soldiers of the 28th Brigade are more eager for a ceasefire than British soldiers of the 29th Brigade, because the latter will definitely leave Korea before the end of the year anyway." The dispatch also said: "Canadian soldiers in the British Brigade happily welcomed the news of Malik's peace proposal today." When a Canadian officer, Captain Millis, told the soldiers about Malik's peace proposal, one soldier shouted: "Good, let's get out of North Korea." Before he could finish his sentence, he was drowned out by a storm of cheers from hundreds of soldiers.

Although people all over the world warmly support Malik's peace proposal, and even the vast majority of soldiers in the American and British invading armies are unwilling to continue fighting for the American aggressors, the American aggressors remain indifferent to Malik's peace proposal and continue to insist on the war of aggression. Washington officials have continuously released an atmosphere of "doubtful" and "should not be optimistic." Van Fleet, one of the leaders of the U.S. military invading Korea, said: "We are still doing our thing here as usual, fulfilling our military tasks."

　　马立克和平建议受到广泛欢迎
    美国保守报纸与议员亦纷纷表示拥护  侵朝美英士兵要求结束可耻侵略战争
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日电：据报纸消息，联合国大会主席安迪让向记者说，由于马立克的建议，他对终止朝鲜战争怀有“很大的希望。”
    《纽约时报》记者海米尔登说，联合国大多数代表都“认为应该透彻地研究苏联这个建议。”
    《指南针日报》记者埃德尔引据“有资格的人士”的话，指出马立克的建议显然“使局面变得”有利于和平。
    《商务日报》评论说，朝鲜冲突的停止可能使美国国会把动员和扩军计划的期限更为延长，这就等于说利润将要减少，并引起恐惧，害怕“以后两三年内会形成相当严重的商业衰退。”
    然而，尽管官方表现得恐惧和谨慎，马立克的建议却引起了最广泛的积极的反应，即使通常都是支持政府计划的保守分子也表示响应。据美联社驻华盛顿记者报道，参议院外交委员会主席康纳利向记者说：“马立克的建议应受到慎重而适当的考虑。”
    外交委员会另一委员佐治亚州参议员乔治也主张美国研讨这件事。
    指南针日报发表社论，要求迅速接受马立克的建议。社论说：“对于马立克周末提出的作为朝鲜和平的第一步的建议，我们只能抱一种态度，就是接受这个建议。”
    【新华社二十八日讯】苏联驻安全理事会代表马立克于二十三日提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，已得到全世界爱好和平人民的普遍拥护，而且在侵略朝鲜的美英军队的士兵中引起了强烈的反应，这些士兵要求立即结束这个不得人心的侵略战争。据美联社二十四日电透露：当马立克的和平建议的消息传到朝鲜前线时，“像一颗小型原子弹似地在听到发展情况的兵士们中间爆发开来”。美国侵略军队中的士兵们“莫不兴高采烈，喜出望外”。“大家都热烈盼望结束朝鲜战争”。一个正忙着修理电话线的美军中士在听到这一消息时，立即从电话线杆顶上爬下来说：“那是顶好的事情，现在我们可以回家了。”一个美军下士对另一个美国兵说：“你停止做你手头的事情吧。可诅咒的战争已经结束了。”又有一个美国兵说：“我希望我们会接受这个建议。”“它是我从来没有听到过的最好消息。”另据路透社二十四日电称：美国许多“官兵们都表示希望，这场看来是无止境的战争终于可能得到解决，他们可能得到一个机会离开一个对他们说来只是死亡和毁灭的国家”。
    在英国军队的士兵中，情况更是如此。据美联社二十四日另一则电讯透露：“前线英联邦军队没有听到无线电广播马立克和平建议的消息，他们今天抱着很大的希望来核对这个消息。”该电说“第二十八旅的英国兵比二十九旅的英国兵更盼望停火，因为后者不管怎样在年底以前一定会离开朝鲜。”该电又说：“英国旅的加拿大士兵今日愉快地欢迎马立克的和平建议的消息”。一个加拿大军官米里斯上尉对士兵说马立克的和平建议时，一个士兵大声喊叫：“好，让我们离开北朝鲜。”他这句话还没有说完，就被成百的士兵的暴风雨般的欢呼声所淹没了。
    尽管全世界人民都热烈拥护马立克的和平建议，甚至美英侵略军队中的广大士兵也不愿为美国侵略者继续卖命，但是美国侵略者对马立克的和平建议仍表示冷淡，而且继续坚持侵略战争。华盛顿官方接连放出了“值得怀疑”“不应乐观”的空气。侵朝美军首脑之一的范佛里特则表示：“我们这里还是照常干我们的事，履行我们的军事任务。”
