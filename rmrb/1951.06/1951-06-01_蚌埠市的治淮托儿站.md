Tens of thousands of women are participating in the Huai River governance project with unparalleled enthusiasm. However, some working mothers are troubled by the burden of their children. In Bengbu city alone, among the 1,549 female migrant workers, more than 200 are mothers. Every time they go to work on the riverbank, more than 300 children, big and small, follow them, which hinders the mothers' work.

The Bengbu City Democratic Women's Federation paid attention to this problem. After two or three months of preparation, this spring, four nurseries for the Huai River governance were established successively on the Huai River embankment in Bengbu City. At present, they have accommodated more than 120 children aged one to eight. The four nurseries are distributed in areas where there are more female migrant workers and are not too far from the children's homes, so that mothers can easily pick up and drop off their children when going to and from work.

The nurseries provide free meals for the children every day. The children wear clothes distributed by the Production and Disaster Relief Committee. The nursery staff try their best to transform all kinds of waste materials into toys for the children, and lead them to play with mud, play games, and sing songs. In this way, the children gradually developed a good impression of the nurseries and became more and more accustomed to collective life, and developed a habit of cleanliness.

The establishment of the Huai River governance nurseries has encouraged the emotions of the mothers working on the riverbank. They feel the kind care of the country and the government, and everyone is working harder. This can be seen from the number of cubic meters of earth excavated by the female migrant workers. Generally, the amount of earth excavated has increased from 1.6 cubic meters per day to 3.6 cubic meters. Female migrant worker Gan Caishan was rated as a special-class Huai River governance hero in the red flag competition. Her ability to achieve 4 cubic meters of earth per day is related to the fact that she sent her children to the nursery and reduced her burden. Many female migrant workers have pledged to intensify their work, ensure the completion of the Huai River governance task, and thank Chairman Mao for his care for them.

### 蚌埠市的治淮托儿站

　　蚌埠市的治淮托儿站
    成千成万的妇女正以无比的热情，参加治淮工程。但是，有些做母亲的民工却为孩子的牵累所苦恼。只蚌埠一市一千五百四十九名女民工中，有二百多个是孩子的母亲。她们每到河堤上工作，跟着去的大大小小孩子就有三百多个，这对母亲们的工作是有妨碍的。
    蚌埠市民主妇女联合会注意了这个问题，经过两三个月的筹备，今年春天，在蚌埠市淮河堤上先后成立了四个治淮托儿站，目前已收容了一百二十多个一岁至八岁的小孩。四个托儿站分布在女民工比较多的地段，离孩子们的家不太远，这样可以使母亲在上下工时接送孩子很方便。
    托儿站每天免费给孩子们吃饭。孩子们身上穿上了生产救灾委员会发下的衣服。保育员想尽种种办法，利用各种废物为孩子改造成玩具，并带他们摆泥堆、做游戏、唱歌。这样，逐步使孩子们对托儿站发生了好感，对集体的生活一天天习惯起来，并使孩子们养成了爱清洁的习惯。
    治淮托儿站的设立，鼓舞了那些在河堤上工作的母亲们的情绪，她们感到国家和政府亲切的照顾，大家劳动更有劲了。这是从女民工挖土方的数字上可以看得出来的。一般由每天挖一·六公方土增加到三·六公方土，女民工甘采善在红旗竞赛中，被评选为特等治淮功臣。她能取得每日四公方土的成绩，是和她把孩子送进托儿站、减少了拖累有关系的。很多女民工提出保证，一定要加紧工作，保证完成治淮任务，答谢毛主席对她们的关心。
