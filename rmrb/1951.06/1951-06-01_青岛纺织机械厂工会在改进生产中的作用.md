The Role of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory Trade Union in Improving Production
　　Miu Xiangtao

　　Since liberation, the production of the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory has been getting stronger day by day. Taking cast iron production as an example, last December increased by more than 38 percent compared to December 1949. The number of man-hours required to manufacture each carding machine was reduced by more than 35 percent compared to April 1950. The quality has also improved. Costs have been greatly reduced. In July 1949, the cost borne by each direct worker (because there was no accurate cost accounting at the time, wages, indirect expenses, and management fees were averaged per person) was equivalent to about 68.86 pounds of second-grade flour; in July 1950, it was only equivalent to 48.3 pounds. Last year, 1,957 new records were achieved; the number of people setting new records accounted for 82.6 percent of all employees. Eighty-three tools were created and improved throughout the year. The factory's production success is mainly due to the trade union focusing on production and fully assisting the administrative side in production work.

　　1. The trade union assisted the administrative side in formulating production plans, moving from blind production to preliminary planned production. Before and in the early days after liberation, the factory mainly did repair work for various textile factories, and the production tasks were very fragmented, and the time records were not sound. The administrative side never had a production plan, which made it difficult to improve production. In October 1949, the trade union absorbed the experience of the Northeast and took the initiative to propose an estimating work and reward method; from November 1949, it began to estimate the production time of products. After half a year of estimating work, there were preliminary time records. The Central Textile Industry Department assigned the factory the task of manufacturing carding machines in April last year. The production tasks were no longer fragmented, and preliminary time records were available, making it possible to formulate production plans. Therefore, the trade union demanded the formulation of production plans. The administrative side began to formulate a production plan. However, this plan was general, with only overall requirements, and not closely integrated with the actual situation in the workshops. The order in which various products were to be completed was not unified, and there was no certainty whether it could be completed. From May, the workshop technicians and the trade union workshop production committee discussed and determined the plans for the tasks assigned to each workshop, so that the production plans were close to actual capabilities. From July, the trade union assisted the workshop technicians to allocate the tasks of their respective workshops to each group after everyone's discussion, and each group specifically assigned them to each individual. In this way, the production plan of the entire factory and even individuals was formulated. Doing so strengthened the planning of production. At the same time, everyone clearly knew the goals to strive for, and they worked harder.

　　2. The trade union assisted the administration in improving production management and did a lot of work in reforming the old system and establishing a new system. In November 1949, the administration abolished the body search system of the Kuomintang period, which oppressed and insulted workers, and improved the production enthusiasm of the workers. Last year, it mobilized workers to change the method of issuing wages during production time to issuing them during the lunch break, saving a lot of man-hours. In the production process, many problems often occur due to the unsoundness of the system, and the trade union collects opinions and studies solutions at any time. For example, in the past, a large number of rollers (a part on the textile machine) became waste products after quenching due to poor materials. The trade union, together with the administration, held a carbonitriding quenching symposium on rollers and established a material inspection and trial quenching system, avoiding a large number of scrapping. There have also been some improvements in the management organization. In September last year, with the assistance of the trade union, an efficiency group and a statistics group were established under the planning section. Six workers were promoted to be efficiency officers and two workers were promoted to be statisticians. The efficiency group specializes in studying production efficiency, sorting out past records, mastering new records, analyzing processes, reviewing standard production time and standard production volume, and rationally organizing labor as the basis for formulating technical norms. The statistical work was previously presided over by the cost group of the accounting section; after the establishment of the statistical group, the statistical group was specifically responsible for statistical work, and there were relatively sound and reliable records of production figures. The establishment and reform of many systems have strengthened production management and improved production efficiency.

　　3. The trade union strengthened labor discipline education for the masses of workers and established production order. The trade union's mobilization of employees to give up year-end bonuses in January last year was blunt and caused dissatisfaction among employees; coupled with the fact that no bonuses were given after the estimation of work, the production morale of workers was low, labor discipline was lax, and the phenomenon of being late and leaving early was extremely serious. Workers who only worked two or three hours a day accounted for 20 percent, those who worked four or five hours accounted for 30 percent, and those who worked six or seven hours accounted for 50 percent. Managers did not dare to manage workers, and the production order was very chaotic. The trade union immediately decided to make rectifying labor discipline the central task at that time. The trade union held employee training classes, absorbing more than 170 trade union cadres, Communist Party members, Youth League members, veteran technicians, and activists to participate in the study, improving their awareness. Then, using them as the backbone, labor discipline was initially rectified. Then, the estimated work bonuses were issued. The morale of the employees began to change, and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline was gradually overcome. In May, a labor competition was launched, and in the competition, the masses were further mobilized to formulate labor agreements, and labor discipline was further strengthened. Individual workers did not obey the management of technical personnel in production, and the trade union vigorously carried out persuasion and education. For example, Yuan Youcheng, the leader of the sheet metal group of the cold working workshop, had excellent technology, but his thinking was backward, he did not abide by labor discipline, and he did not obey management; the labor discipline of the group was very bad, which affected the production of the bottom of the machine (a part on the carding machine). The trade union found Yuan Youcheng for individual talks and held a workshop meeting for criticism and education. After that, Yuan Youcheng changed, and the labor discipline of the group also improved. All the workers in the group actively produced, which doubled the output.

　　4. The trade union mobilized employees to study technology and overcome difficulties. The factory often encountered some technical difficulties in production, and the trade union always organized technical personnel and workers to study and solve them together. In 1949, the source of cover iron sheets used by the factory was difficult. The trade union organized technician Peng Renhong and veteran workers Chen Xifeng and Ji Shouxin to study it. As a result, a toothed punching machine was created, which solved this difficulty and saved more than 200 million yuan per month. Last year, after the factory undertook the manufacture of carding machines, the stock of zinc plates for the bottom of the carding machine (goods from outside) was quickly used up. At that time, there were technical difficulties in self-manufacturing. Because each bottom has thousands of small holes, which must be drilled one by one, it takes an average of two and a half days to make one piece, which cannot meet the needs of the assembly plant. Therefore, the trade union workshop director and the most technically skilled veteran worker Wang Zhengji studied and improved the drilling method, and asked the workshop technicians to help Wang Zhengji draw drawings. Finally, the spring punching die for the zinc plate at the bottom of the carding machine was created, which improved the work efficiency by 80 times, and one small bottom could be made every nine minutes. In addition, in order to improve the skills of workers, the trade union organized technical training classes, invited technical personnel to be teachers, mobilized trade union groups to establish "lunch meetings," and used the lunch break to study technology; and helped apprentices find masters to sign apprenticeship contracts. These works have played a great role in improving the skills of workers.

　　5. The trade union supervised and helped the administration improve safety and health equipment, and improved the production enthusiasm of the masses of workers. The trade union has always paid great attention to the safety and health of workers, often conducts inspections, and conducts safety and health education for employees. At the same time, it urges the administrative side to gradually improve safety devices and health equipment. The workers' requests, as long as they are reasonable and possible, the trade union strives to achieve them. Sometimes, although the requests put forward by the workers are reasonable, they cannot be done for a while, or they are unreasonable, and the trade union takes the initiative to explain to the workers. The trade union always takes the initiative to take care of the workers' lives. When workers get sick, trade union cadres visit and try to help them solve their difficulties. Because the trade union cares about the lives of workers, it has greatly improved the production enthusiasm of workers.

　　The state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory also has some weaknesses: the production plan is not reasonable enough, and after some departments have completed their tasks ahead of schedule, there is no plan. The phenomenon of waiting for materials has not been completely eliminated. The rewards are not timely. The factory management committee does not prepare fully before the meeting and fails to play its due role. These problems need the trade union to assist the administration to find solutions, so that the factory's production can be further improved.

　　青岛纺织机械厂工会在改进生产中的作用
    缪祥焘
    国营青岛纺织机械厂，解放后生产一天比一天强。拿铸铁的产量来说，去年十二月比一九四九年十二月提高了百分之三十八以上。制造每台梳棉机所需的工数比一九五○年四月减低了百分之三十五以上。质量也提高了。成本大大降低。一九四九年七月，每一个直接人工应负担费用（因为还没有精确的成本计算，所以把工资、间接费用、管理费等按人数平均）约合二等面粉六十八点八六磅；一九五○年七月，就只合四十八点三磅。去年一年中出现了一千九百五十七件新纪录；创新纪录的人数占全体职工的百分之八十二点六。去年全年创造和改进了八十三件工具。该厂在生产上有这样的成绩，主要原因之一是工会面向生产，全力协助行政方面进行了生产工作。
    一、工会协助行政方面制订了生产计划，从盲目生产走上初步的计划生产。该厂在解放前及解放初期，一直是替各纺织厂做修配工作，生产任务很零碎，工时记录也不健全。行政方面一向没有生产计划，这样就很难提高生产。一九四九年十月，工会便吸取东北经验，主动提出估工奖励办法；从一九四九年十一月起开始对产品的生产时间作出估计。经过半年的估工，有了初步的工时记录。中央纺织工业部于去年四月交给该厂制造梳棉机的任务。生产任务不零碎了，初步的工时记录也有了，便有可能制订生产计划了。于是工会便要求制订生产计划。行政方面开始订出一个生产计划。但这个计划是笼统的，只有总的要求，与车间的实际情况结合得不够，各种产品完成的先后次序也没有统一规定，能不能完成没有把握。五月份起，车间技术人员与工会车间生产委员把分配给各车间的任务，讨论后确定计划，使生产计划与实际能力相接近。七月份起，工会又协助车间技师把他本车间的任务经大家讨论后，分配给各组，各组又具体分配给每一个人。如此订出了全厂以至个人的生产计划。这样做了之后，加强了生产的计划性。同时，每个人明确地知道了奋斗目标，干活也起劲了。
    二、工会协助行政改进了生产管理，对于改革旧制度，建立新制度，做了不少工作。在一九四九年十一月行政上废除了国民党时期的压迫工人侮辱工人的搜身制度，提高了工人的生产积极性。去年又动员工人将生产时间内发放工资的办法改在中午休息时间发放，节省了很多工时。在生产过程中，往往因为制度不健全发生许多问题，工会随时搜集意见研究解决。例如过去大批罗拉（纺织机上的一种零件）淬火后因材料不好成了废品，工会即会同行政召开罗拉加炭淬火座谈会，建立了材料检验试淬制度，避免了大批报废的现象。在管理机构方面也有某些改进。去年九月，在工会的协助下，在计划股下面成立了效率组和统计组。提拔了六个工友做效率员，两个工友做统计员。效率组专门研究生产效率，整理过去的旧记录，掌握新记录，分析工序，审订标准生产时间、标准生产量，合理组织劳动力，作为制定技术定额的依据。统计工作过去由会计课成本组主持；成立了统计组以后，由统计组专门担任统计工作，对于生产数字有了比较健全的可靠的记录。许多制度的建立和改革，加强了生产管理，提高了生产效率。
    三、工会对工人群众加强劳动纪律教育，建立了生产秩序。工会在去年一月动员职工放弃年奖时方式生硬，引起职工不满；加以估工以后又没有进行奖励，工人生产情绪低落，劳动纪律松弛，迟到早退现象极端严重。工人每天只干两、三个钟头的占百分之二十，干四、五个钟头的占百分之三十，干六、七个钟头的占百分之五十。管理人员不敢管工人，生产秩序非常混乱。工会当即决定以整顿劳动纪律为当时中心工作。由工会举办了职工训练班，吸收一百七十多个工会干部、共产党员、青年团员、老技术工人和积极分子参加学习，提高了他们的觉悟。然后，以他们作骨干，初步整顿了劳动纪律。接着又发放了估工奖金。职工情绪开始转变，劳动纪律废弛的现象逐渐克服。五月间展开了劳动竞赛，在竞赛中进一步发动群众订立劳动公约，进一步加强了劳动纪律。个别工人在生产中不服从技术人员管理，工会就大力进行说服教育。例如冷作工场白铁组组长袁有成，技术很好，但思想落后，不遵守劳动纪律，不服从管理；该组劳动纪律非常坏，影响了漏底（梳棉机上的一种零件）的生产。工会就找袁有成进行个别谈话，并召开车间大会进行批评教育。此后袁有成改变了，该组的劳动纪律也好了。全组工友积极生产，使产量提高一倍。
    四、工会发动了职工研究技术，克服困难。该厂在生产上往往发生一些技术上的困难问题，工会总是组织技术人员和工人一起研究解决。一九四九年该厂所用的盖板铁皮来源困难，工会便组织技术员彭仁洪和老工人陈锡俸、姬守信来研究，结果创造了冲齿机，解决了这个困难，每月并可节省两亿余元。去年该厂承制梳棉机以后，梳棉机的漏底锌板存货（外来货）很快就用完了。当时自己制造技术上有困难。因为每一漏底有数千小孔，要一个个地钻，平均要两天半才能做成一块，供不上装配场的需要。于是工会车间主任与技术最好的老工人王正玑研究改进钻孔方法，请车间技术人员帮助王正玑绘图，终于创造了梳棉机漏底锌板弹簧冲模，提高了工作效率八十倍，每九分钟即可做成一块小漏底。此外，工会为了提高工人的技术，组织了技术学习班，请技术人员当教员，发动工会小组建立“午饭会”，利用中午休息时间研究技术；并帮助学徒找到师傅订立师徒合同。这些工作，对于提高工人技术起了很大作用。
    五、工会督促与帮助行政改善了安全卫生设备，提高了工人群众的生产热情。工会对工人的安全卫生一向很注意，经常进行检查，向职工进行安全卫生教育。同时督促行政方面逐步改进安全装置和卫生设备。工人的要求只要是合理的，而且可能办到的，工会就力争办到。有时工人提出来的要求虽然合理，但一时还办不到，或者是不合理的，工会就主动给工人解释。工会对于工人生活总是主动去照顾。工人害病时，工会干部去慰问并设法替他解决困难。由于工会关心工人生活，大大提高了工人的生产热情。
    国营青岛纺织机械厂也还存在着一些弱点：生产计划还不够合理，某些部门提前完成任务以后，就没有计划了。停工待料现象还未完全消灭。奖励不及时。工厂管理委员会开会之前没有充分准备，未能发挥应有的作用。这些问题都需要工会协助行政求得解决，使该厂的生产进一步提高。
