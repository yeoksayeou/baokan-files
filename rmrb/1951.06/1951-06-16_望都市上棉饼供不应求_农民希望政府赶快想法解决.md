    Cottonseed Cake Supply in Wangdu City Fails to Meet Demand
    Farmers Hope the Government Will Quickly Find a Solution
Comrade Editor:
    Farmers in Wangdu County, Hebei Province, are currently in need of fertilizer, but the supply of cottonseed cake on the market cannot meet the demand. This spring, the oil factory under the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry began selling cottonseed cake in Wangdu. In early May, more than 90 percent of the cottonseed cake sold in the Wangdu market was produced by the oil factory under the Provincial Department of Industry, and cottonseed cake from other factories was no longer transported to Wangdu for sale. In late May, after the rain in Wangdu, farmers needed a large amount of fertilizer, but the cottonseed cake from the oil factory under the Provincial Department of Industry could not be supplied. The price of cottonseed cake, which was originally 480 yuan per jin, rose to 560 yuan on June 3rd. According to the current situation, if no new goods are transported in within two or three days, farmers in Wangdu will be in danger of not being able to buy fertilizer.
    When wheat was planted in the autumn of 1950, the price of cottonseed cake in Wangdu was equal to the price of wheat, and farmers suffered incalculable losses. Judging from the current situation, if the relevant authorities do not find a way to solve the problem, the supply of cottonseed cake will probably be the same as it was in the autumn of 1950. The farmers in Wangdu are very anxious about this matter, and they hope that the relevant authorities will quickly solve this problem.

### 望都市上棉饼供不应求  农民希望政府赶快想法解决

　　望都市上棉饼供不应求        
    农民希望政府赶快想法解决编辑同志：
    河北省望都县农民现在正需要肥料，市上的棉饼供不应求。今年春季，河北省人民政府工业厅所属制油厂，开始在望都销售棉饼，五月初，望都市场上成交的棉饼，有百分之九十以上是省工业厅所属制油厂的产品，其他各厂的棉饼就不再运到望都出售了。五月下旬，望都落雨以后，农民需要大量肥料，省工业厅所属制油厂的棉饼却供应不上了。原来卖四百八十元一斤的棉饼，六月三日涨到五百六十元。根据现在的情况看来，二、三日内如再没有新货运到，望都农民就有买不到肥料的危险。
    一九五○年秋季种麦的时候，望都棉饼与小麦的价格相等，农民受了不可计算的损失。照现在的情况看，有关机关如不设法解决，棉饼的供应恐怕又要和一九五○年的秋季情况一样了，望都农民为了这件事情，非常焦急，他们希望有关机关赶快解决这个问题。
