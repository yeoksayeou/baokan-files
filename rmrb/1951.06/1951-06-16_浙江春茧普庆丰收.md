　　Zhejiang's spring cocoons have had a bumper harvest this year. Each silkworm egg sheet can yield up to seventy or eighty catties of cocoons at best, and at least thirty catties, generally more than forty catties. The quality of spring cocoons is also higher than in previous years.

　　Currently, the spring cocoon purchasing work has been fully launched. As of June 7th, all 250 purchasing offices and stations of the Zhejiang Provincial United Cocoon Purchasing Office have started purchasing. On June 3rd alone, 117 dan of local fresh cocoons and 22,937 dan of improved fresh cocoons were purchased. During the purchase, due to the high patriotic enthusiasm of the silkworm farmers, they all brought improved fresh cocoons for sale, and in some areas, silkworm farmers even selected bad cocoons before selling them.

　　However, there are still several issues that need attention in the cocoon purchasing work: First, the cocoon price assessment at some purchasing offices and stations is not reasonable enough, so that good cocoons sometimes do not sell for a good price. Second, the savings work of silkworm farmers in cocoon-producing areas has been gradually launched, but because the publicity work is not done enough, silkworm farmers do not have a deep understanding of the significance of savings, and there are some concerns, so the savings figures of silkworm farmers in some areas are very small and the deposit time is very short. In addition, in some areas, sabotage by special agents was discovered in the cocoon purchasing work. For example, the Yongli purchasing station in Wukang County found matches hidden in the purchased fresh cocoons, which was fortunately discovered in time without suffering losses.

　　Various state-owned specialized companies and cooperatives in Zhejiang are cooperating in purchasing spring cocoons and vigorously carrying out supply work in cocoon-producing areas. Grain, department store, native produce, oil and grease, salt and other companies have prepared a large amount of food rice and various goods and transported them to cocoon-producing areas, and some companies have added many supply agencies. In order to cooperate with the purchase, supply and marketing cooperatives have also added supply agencies. In addition to preparing their own supply materials, they also sell grain, bean cakes, fertilizer powder and various department stores on behalf of various state-owned companies. In order to do a better job in the supply work, the Commercial Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government organized an inspection team to conduct inspections from May 21st to 30th. After the inspection, it was believed that although the supply work in various places has been carefully arranged, there are still some shortcomings, such as the untimely arrival of materials in the countryside, insufficient mutual contact between various supply agencies, and the supply of materials cannot fully meet the needs of silkworm farmers, which must be overcome.

### 浙江春茧普庆丰收

　　浙江春茧普庆丰收
    今年浙江全省春茧普庆丰收。一张蚕种，最高能收茧七、八十斤，最低的三十余斤，一般都在四十斤以上。春茧品质也较往年为高。
    现在春茧收购工作已经全面展开。到六月七日为止，浙江省春茧联购办事处所有二百五十个收购处和收购站已全部开秤收购。六月三日一天中，即收购了土种鲜茧一百十七担，改良鲜茧二万二千九百三十七担。收购时，由于蚕农爱国热情高涨，都把改良鲜茧拿来出售，有些地区蚕农并把坏茧选出后再出售。
    但在收茧工作当中，还存在着几个问题需要注意：一、部分收购处、站评定茧价尚不够合理，以致有时好茧卖不到好价。二、产茧区蚕农储蓄工作已在逐步展开，但因宣传工作做得不够，蚕农对储蓄的意义还未深刻了解，存在着一些顾虑，所以有些地区蚕农储蓄数字很小，存的时间很短。另外，个别地区在收茧工作中发现有特务破坏。如武康县永利收购站在所购进的鲜茧中，发现潜藏火柴，幸经及时发觉，未遭损失。
    浙江各国营专业公司和合作社配合收购春茧，在产茧区大力展开供应工作。粮食、百货、土产、油脂、盐业等公司大量准备了食米和各种货物运到产茧地区，有些公司增设了许多供应机构。供销合作社为配合收购，也增设供应机构，除本身准备供应物资外，并为各国营公司代销粮食、豆饼、肥田粉及各种百货等。浙江省人民政府商业厅为把供应工作做得更好，在五月二十一日至三十日曾组织检查小组进行检查。检查后，认为各地的供应工作虽然已有周密布置，但还有几个缺点，如物资下乡不及时、各供应机构互相联系不够、供应的物资还不能完全适合蚕农的需要等，还须加以克服。
