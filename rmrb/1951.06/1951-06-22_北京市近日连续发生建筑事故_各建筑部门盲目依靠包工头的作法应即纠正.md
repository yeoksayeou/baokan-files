Following the serious incident at the Beijing Yongmao Construction Engineering Company's Mechanical Brickyard, where newly built factory buildings collapsed, resulting in the death and injury of workers, Beijing has recently seen a series of unfortunate incidents of worker deaths and injuries due to construction accidents. On May 29th, carpenter Che Cunxiang died of electric shock while repairing a lead-iron shed at the privately-owned Capital Physical and Chemical Instrument Factory because the lead-iron came into contact with electrical wires. On May 31st, at the Shuangyushu construction site in the western suburbs of Renmin University's Construction Office, a horizontal bar of the scaffolding on the third floor of the classroom building under construction broke, and four workers fell from the scaffolding, more than four zhang (丈) high, seriously injuring two and slightly injuring two. On June 5th, at the New China Animal Husbandry Farm construction site in the western suburbs, 11 workers were repairing the roof of a cowshed when all sixteen cowsheds collapsed, injuring ten workers, including three seriously and seven slightly injured; seven dairy cows were also killed. On June 6th, the dining shed at the Yongmao Construction Engineering Company's Nationalities Institute construction site collapsed, injuring three workers, including two seriously injured, one of whom died from their injuries. On June 4th, six workers at the Fengtai warehouse of the Central Government Directly Affiliated Construction Office were injured while moving cement, after a cement stack collapsed, including three seriously injured and three slightly injured.

The cause of the above construction accidents is that various construction departments do not pay enough attention to the safety of workers. For example, the Renmin University Construction Office used overly thin fir poles to erect the scaffolding, and the administration did not conduct timely inspections, resulting in the scaffolding breaking. However, the more important reason is that the various construction departments have not established the correct ideology of relying on the working class, but instead rely on foremen, believing that handing over tasks to foremen can solve all construction problems. For example, the New China Animal Husbandry Farm entrusted the repair of cowsheds and houses entirely to carpenter foreman Fan Kuijiang and bricklayer foreman Yin Changli to draw up designs or construction, without seeking design and construction from a construction company, nor submitting an application for approval from the Construction Bureau. Many places did not meet construction specifications. The inclined pillars supporting the cowshed roof, which was built without four walls, were removed before the repair was completed, causing the cowshed to collapse. After the Yongmao Construction Engineering Company's Nationalities Institute construction site contracted the construction of the dining shed to carpenter foreman Zhou Huifang and bricklayer Xu Zhishen, the site leadership believed that the task was completed. However, the foremen arbitrarily changed the original design during construction, changing the depth from four and a half meters to six meters. When the length of the beam was insufficient, two beams were joined together, with no support pillars underneath the joint, only wooden boards clamping them in place, causing the roof to collapse during construction.

After the above accidents occurred, some construction units carried out after-care and actively tried to improve safety work. For example, the Renmin University Construction Office conducted safety education among all workers, mobilized everyone to do a good job in safety work, formed a safety group, and implemented a universal safety inspection. The administration and trade union of the Central Government Directly Affiliated Construction Office also negotiated and established collective safety incentive measures. However, many public and private construction departments still do not pay enough attention to this, and still do not pay attention to the safety conditions of workers. For example, some units' workers' sheds leak rain, which is very dangerous in rainy weather. Some construction departments even still violate construction regulations during construction, affecting the solidity of the construction and the safety of workers. In addition, workers' welfare and hygiene are also a serious problem. General hygiene equipment is insufficient, and workers who are sick cannot get timely medical treatment; at the same time, working hours are too long, from twelve to fourteen hours a day, which seriously affects the health of workers. This extremely irresponsible attitude towards the life safety and welfare of workers should arouse the serious attention of relevant departments, investigate the responsibility for the accidents, give appropriate punishment, and formulate effective measures to avoid similar unfortunate events from happening again.

### 北京市近日连续发生建筑事故  各建筑部门盲目依靠包工头的作法应即纠正

　　北京市近日连续发生建筑事故
    各建筑部门盲目依靠包工头的作法应即纠正
    在北京永茂建筑工程公司机械砖窑厂发生新建厂房倒塌压死压伤工人的严重事件之后，北京市近日又连续因发生建筑事故而死伤工人的不幸事件。五月二十九日，木工工人车村祥在私营首都理化仪器制造厂修理铅铁棚，因铅铁接触电线致触电身死。五月三十一日人民大学修建处西郊双榆树工地，建筑教室大楼的第三层架子横杆折断，四个工人从四丈多高的架子上摔下，重伤二人，轻伤二人。六月五日西郊新中国牧畜场工地，有十一名工人正在牛棚上修理棚顶，十六间牛棚全部倒塌，伤工人十名，其中重伤三人，轻伤七人；砸死奶牛七头。六月六日永茂建筑工程公司民族学院工地饭棚倒塌，砸伤工人三名，其中重伤二人，一人因伤势过重死亡。六月四日中直修建办事处丰台仓库的工人在搬洋灰时，因洋灰垛倒下来而被砸伤六名，其中重伤三人，轻伤三人。
    发生以上建筑事故的原因，是由于各建筑部门对工人的安全不够重视。如人民大学修建处搭架子的杉槁太细，行政上没有及时检查，致使架子折断。但更重要的原因还是各建筑部门没有树立正确的依靠工人阶级的思想，而是依靠包工头，以为交给包工头就可以解决一切建筑问题。如新中国牧畜场修理牛棚与房子，既没有找建筑公司设计施工，也没有向建设局申报批准，就完全交给木工头范魁江与瓦工头尹长利画图或施工，有许多地方不合建筑规格。修理四面没有墙的牛棚，没有修完就把顶牛棚的斜柱子拆去，致使牛棚倒塌。永茂建筑工程公司民族学院工地把建筑饭棚的工程，包给木工头周惠芳与瓦工头徐芝森后，工地领导上就认为完成了任务。而工头就在施工中擅自改变原来的设计，把四米五进深改为六米进深，梁的长度不够就用两个接起来，在相接处下面没有支柱只用木板夹住，致使房顶在施工中倒塌。
    上述事故发生后，有的建筑单位进行善后处理外，并积极设法改进安全工作。如人民大学修建处在全体工人中进行了安全教育，发动大家做好安全工作，编了安全组，并实行了一次普遍的安全检查。中直修建办事处行政和工会也协商订出了集体安全奖励办法。但目前仍有许多公私营建筑部门对此还未足够重视，对工人的安全条件仍极不注意，如有的单位工棚漏雨，一遇雨天很危险，有的建筑部在施工时甚至仍然违犯建筑规程，影响建设的牢固和工人的安全。此外工人的福利卫生也是一个严重问题，一般卫生设备不够，工人患病不能及时得到医治；同时工时过长每日十二小时至十四小时，严重地影响了工人健康；这种对工人生命安全以及福利卫生极不负责任的态度，应引起有关部门的严重注意，追查事故的责任，予以适当的处分，并切实制订有效的办法，以避免再发生类似不幸事件。
