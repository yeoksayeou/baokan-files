Many heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, after receiving warm regards from the people of the motherland, have expressed their determination to repay the love of the motherland with even greater victories. Chen Xiwu, a heroic mortar shooter of a certain unit, once created the outstanding record of seven hits out of seven shots in combat. This time, the motherland's people's comfort group presented him with a commemorative badge with Chairman Mao's image and a watch. After receiving the gifts from the people of the motherland, Chen Xiwu signed a pledge, guaranteeing that he would continue to carry forward the spirit of resolute, courageous, and tenacious fighting, fight well, and make contributions to the motherland.

Liu Wenkui, Du Tinggui, Ding Kequan, Fang Yuhong and other four warriors who made outstanding contributions in the battle to capture Highland 702 north of Huachuan on April 24, called the fountain pens that the comfort group gave to each of them as "victory pens given to us by the people of the motherland." Du Tinggui, who killed and wounded more than seventy enemies in the battle, said: "When I was in the motherland, I made up my mind to come to Korea to make great contributions. The achievements I have made this time do not count. I will make more contributions to the Chinese and Korean people in the next battle." The warriors excitedly used their "victory pens" to make their new plans for meritorious service.

Jia Jinxiang and Yu Kun, heroes of another unit of the Volunteer Army, wrote a letter of determination to their superiors with the fountain pens given to them by the people of the motherland, saying: "We have only made a little contribution, and we are really ashamed to accept such a grand gift from the people of the motherland. We are determined to eliminate more enemies, capture more prisoners, and maintain and carry forward the past glory in future battles."

Many units have also written letters back to the motherland, expressing their determination to respond to the care and love of the people of the motherland with greater victories.

　　志愿军的许多功臣们
　　决心争取更大的胜利　回答祖国人民的热爱
    中国人民志愿军的许多功臣们在受到祖国人民的热烈慰问以后，纷纷表示要用更大的胜利来回答祖国人民的热爱。某部功臣迫击炮射手陈锡武曾经在作战中创造七发七中的杰出战例，这次祖国人民慰问团赠给了他一枚有毛主席像的纪念章和一只表。陈锡武接受了祖国人民的礼物以后，就订了一个保证书，保证今后要继续发扬坚决、勇敢，顽强的战斗精神，打好仗，为祖国立功。
    四月二十四日在攻占华川以北七零二高地的战斗中卓著功勋的刘文奎、杜亭贵、丁克全、方玉洪等四勇士，把慰问团赠给他们每人一支的自来水笔，称做是“祖国人民送给我们的‘胜利笔’”。在战斗中打死打伤七十多个敌人的杜亭贵说：“我在祖国时就下定决心要到朝鲜来立大功。我这次得到的成绩还不算数，我要在下次战斗中再为中、朝人民立功。”勇士们都兴奋地用他们的“胜利笔”订下了自己的新的立功计划。
    另部志愿军的功臣贾金祥和于昆，用祖国人民赠给他们的自来水笔向上级写决心书说：“我们只立了一点小功劳，接受祖国人民这样隆重的礼物，实在很惭愧。我们决心在今后的战斗中多消灭敌人，多抓俘虏，保持和发扬过去的光荣。”
    很多单位也都写信寄回祖国，表示要以更大的胜利，来回答祖国人民的关怀和热爱。
