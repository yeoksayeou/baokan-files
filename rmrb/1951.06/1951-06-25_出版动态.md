　　Newly Launched Popular Pictorial: "Masses Pictorial"
　　Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House launched a popular pictorial "Masses Pictorial" (published every seven days) on the 16th of this month, attempting to "make it understandable and liked by the broad masses of workers and peasants." The publication plans to focus on propaganda around four major events: resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic production increase movement in industry and agriculture. The first issue used two full pages of photographs to depict the active movement of farmers in Shulu County, Hebei Province, in fighting drought and planting cotton. In addition, there are three sets of comic strips, two sets recording heroic stories from the Korean battlefield, and one set is "Ou Xiumei cleverly captures the bandit husband," which praises the righteous behavior of the female hero Ou Xiumei.
  
  The Commercial Press Conducts a Comprehensive Inspection of Old Stock of Books and Periodicals
  The Commercial Press has published approximately 15,000 titles of books and periodicals over the past fifty years. Up to now, there are still nearly 8,000 titles in stock available for sale. A significant portion of these books have problems in terms of viewpoints, ideology, or writing. In the summer of 1950, the press conducted a preliminary inspection of its stock, deciding to discontinue and destroy 554 titles and cease reprinting 450 titles after they were sold out. From the summer of 1950 to the present, more than 400 additional titles have been successively marked for discontinuation and destruction. However, these inspection efforts have not been thorough enough, leading to the continued discovery of books with problematic content. The press has decided to take emergency measures this month, mobilizing the entire staff and requesting assistance from readers in various regions to comprehensively and earnestly intensify the inspection of old stock of books and periodicals, completing all tasks before July 1st.

  The problems existing in the publications of The Commercial Press are indeed numerous. Therefore, the preliminary handling methods recently adopted by the press are generally appropriate. It is hoped that other publishing institutions with similar issues can also comprehensively and thoroughly inspect their publications and handle them accordingly. It must also be pointed out that, with regard to the publications of The Commercial Press, while the inspection of old stock of books and periodicals is very important, the inspection of new books published after liberation should not be neglected either. The three newly published geography books criticized in this issue are an example.
  
  Tianjin Painting Industry Joint Publishing House
  Eleven old New Year picture businesses, one mounting shop, one bookstore (Dazhong Bookstore), and eight printing factories in Tianjin, totaling twenty-one units, formed the Tianjin Painting Industry Joint Publishing House in May under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal News and Publication institutions. The Joint Publishing House focuses on publishing New Year pictures as its primary business, and also plans to publish some propaganda posters, wall charts, and comic strips. The publishing house has organized an editorial and review committee to review old editions of New Year pictures published by participating units, organize new drafts, and unite painters, so as to gradually improve the quality of New Year pictures and other propaganda posters. Through this joint organization, not only has the publication of New Year pictures been unified, but also the division of labor between publishing, distribution, and printing has been realized. Not only has the direction of development of New Year pictures been clarified and corrected, but also the original seasonal business has been developed into a regular business. This experience of Tianjin can be used as a reference for various regions.
  
  East China Vigorously Promotes "Illustrated Explanation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries"
  East China People's Publishing House has edited and published a "Illustrated Explanation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" (popular edition), which has been vigorously promoted by various branches of Xinhua Bookstore in the East China region. Under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, the branches have closely integrated with the vigorous campaign to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries being carried out in various places, mobilized and organized various supporting forces, and universally launched a revolutionary competition to strive for sales, which has greatly developed the distribution of the book. The original preliminary plan to distribute 1.5 million copies in the East China region has been raised to strive for more than 3.5 million copies in the East China region; and in fact, according to recent progress, it is possible to reach 5 million copies. Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch called for special attention to be paid to breadth and depth in the distribution process, and to strive to ensure that one or two copies are available for every ten people in the cities, and that every literate cadre and activist in the countryside has a copy.

　　出版动态
    新创刊的通俗性画刊：《群众画报》
    北京人民美术出版社于本月十六日创刊了一种通俗性画刊《群众画报》（七日刊），企图“办得使广大工农群众看得懂和喜欢看”。该刊计划围绕抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、工农业的爱国增产运动等四件大事进行宣传。第一期用了整两面照片表现了河北省束鹿县农民抗旱种棉的积极运动，另外有三套连环图画，两套是记录了朝鲜战场的英勇故事的，一套是“欧秀妹巧计活捉土匪丈夫”，是表扬女英雄欧秀妹的正义行为的。
  商务印书馆全面检查旧存书刊
    商务印书馆五十多年来出版书刊的总数约为一万五千多种，直到现在还有存书可供发售的约近八千种，很大一部分书籍，无论在观点上、思想上，或是文字上，都有问题。该馆在一九五○年夏，曾就存书作了初步检查，决定绝版销毁的书有五五四种，售完为止不再重版的书有四五○种；从一九五○年夏到现在，陆续决定绝版销毁的书又有四百多种。但这些检查工作做的还不够切实，以致内容有问题的书还是常常发现出来。该馆决定在本月份中采取紧急措置，动员全馆人力，并要求各地读者协助，把旧存书刊的检查工作全面地、认真地加紧做好，在七月一日以前全部办妥。
    商务印书馆的出版物中存在的问题确实很多，因此该馆最近所采取的初步处理办法，一般地说来是适当的。希望与该馆存在着同样性质问题的其他出版机构也能全面地、彻底地检查自己的出版物，分别加以处理。还须指出：就商务印书馆的出版物来说，对旧存书刊的检查固然很重要，对解放后出版的新书的检查也不容忽视，我们本期批评的该馆三本新版的地理书，便是一例。
  天津画业联营出版社
    天津市旧年画业十一家，裱画庄一家，书店一家（大众书店），印刷厂八家，合计二十一个单位，五月间在天津市新闻出版机构的领导下，组成了天津画业联营出版社。联营出版社以出版新年画为主要业务，同时准备出版一些宣传画、挂图和连环图画。该社已组织了一个编审委员会，进行审查参加单位出版的旧版年画，组织新的画稿，团结画家等工作，这样就可以使年画和其他宣传画的质量逐步提高。通过这一个联营组织，不但统一了年画的出版，而且实现了出版、发行、印刷的分工；不但明确了、端正了年画的发展方向，而且把原有的季节性的业务，发展为经常性的业务。天津市的这种经验大可以供各地参考。
  华东大力推销《惩治反革命条例图解》
    华东人民出版社编辑出版了一种《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例图解》（通俗本），已由新华书店华东区各分支店大力推销。各分支店在当地党委与政府领导下，密切结合了各地大张旗鼓地开展着的严厉镇压反革命运动，动员与组织了各种帮助的力量，并普遍掀起了争取推销的革命竞赛，该书发行工作得到极大的开展。原来决定在华东全区发行一百五十万册的初步方案，已经提高到争取在华东全区发行三百五十万册以上；而事实上，按最近的进展，已有达到五百万册的可能。新华书店华东总分店号召在发行过程中，必须特别注意到广度和深度，要尽可能做到城市中每十个人有一两本，农村中识字的干部和积极分子人手一册。
