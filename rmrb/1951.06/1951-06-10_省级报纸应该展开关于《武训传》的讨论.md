A discussion about the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a serious ideological struggle. This discussion should not only resolve the issue of evaluating Wu Xun, but also launch a series of ideological criticisms. This is a major event on our country's ideological front. Leading this discussion is of great significance for educating the people, raising their theoretical and ideological level, and enhancing their political awareness.

Since the People's Daily put forward "We should attach importance to the discussion of the film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have launched discussions and criticisms. Although the film "The Life of Wu Xun" was not shown in the Northeast, the Northeast Daily also paid attention to leading this discussion, criticizing the Lüda Normal School for educating students with the "Spirit of Wu Xun," and the Songjiang Province "Literacy Newsletter" for publishing a comic strip of "The Life of Wu Xun." These are all necessary. The situation reflected by the Northeast Daily is sufficient to prove that not showing the film "The Life of Wu Xun" does not mean that the erroneous influence of the "Spirit of Wu Xun" is not circulating in society.展开 A discussion on Wu Xun based on different local conditions has universal significance.

However, after the discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun" was launched, some large administrative regions' newspapers have not paid enough attention to it, and most provincial newspapers have not yet launched discussions on this issue. Many cities in Guannei (areas inside the Great Wall) have screened "The Life of Wu Xun," and launching this discussion is very necessary. According to our investigation, from May 20th to May 31st, the situation of provincial newspapers discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" can be roughly divided into the following three categories: The first category is that they have published the call issued by the local leading organs on discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" and reprinted some important articles from the People's Daily, which is a minority. And in this category, it is still a very rare phenomenon that preliminary discussions have been carried out, such as publishing relevant readers' letters. The second category is that they have reprinted some important articles from the People's Daily but have not put forward the idea of discussing this issue locally, which is a larger number. The third category is that they did not mention this issue at all, and there are quite a few of these newspapers; even the People's Daily editorial and the articles in the Party Life column, which Xinhua News Agency had broadcast on the same day, had not been published in many large broadsheet newspapers for a long time. It is completely wrong not to speak out at all about this major event on the ideological front.

One of the prominent examples belonging to the third category is the Pingyuan Daily. Wu Xun's ancestral home, Tangyi County, now belongs to the Liaocheng Prefecture of Pingyuan Province. The feudal rulers since the Qing Dynasty have tried their best to promote the "Spirit of Wu Xun" here, and its influence has been circulating to this day, which cannot be ignored. Moreover, since Wu Xun's life and educational activities were mainly in the current Pingyuan Province, it is also very valuable to collect some direct materials and publish the reflections of farmers on Wu Xun. However, the Pingyuan Daily had not published or reprinted any materials on discussing the issue of "The Life of Wu Xun" until June 3rd. Isn't this a neglect of an important event?

It is wrong not to pay any attention to the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." Provincial newspapers should also publish necessary materials on this issue, provide popular explanations, and appropriately lead the discussion on this issue based on the situation in their respective regions.

### 省级报纸应该展开关于《武训传》的讨论

　　省级报纸应该展开关于《武训传》的讨论
    关于电影《武训传》的讨论是一场严重的思想斗争。这次讨论不仅要解决关于武训的评价问题，而且可以由此展开一系列的思想批判工作。这是我国思想战线上的一件大事。领导这个讨论对于教育人民提高理论思想水平和政治觉悟程度有很重要的意义。
    自从人民日报提出“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”之后，北京、天津、上海的报纸已经展开了讨论和批判。电影《武训传》虽然没有在东北上演，但东北日报也注意了领导这个讨论，批评了旅大师范学校以“武训精神”教育学生，松江省“识字通讯”刊载《武训传》连环画的错误。这些都是必要的。东北日报所反映的情况适足以证明没有上演电影《武训传》并不等于在社会上没有流传关于“武训精神”的错误影响。根据各地的不同情况展开关于武训的讨论是有普遍意义的。
    但是，在关于武训传的讨论展开之后，个别大行政区的报纸还有没充分予以注意，而在省报上则多数还没有展开关于这个问题的讨论。关内很多城市已上演过《武训传》，展开这个讨论是很必要的。据我们调查，由五月二十日至五月三十一日间，省级报纸上讨论武训传的情形大体上可以区别为以下三类：第一类是发表了当地领导机关发布的关于讨论《武训传》的号召，并转载了人民日报的若干重要文章的，这是少数。而在这一类中，已经初步进行讨论，如发表了有关的读者来信的还是极个别的现象。第二类是转载了人民日报上的若干重要文章而没有提出在当地讨论这个问题的意见的，这一类为数较多。第三类则完全没有提到这个问题，这一类报纸也不少；甚至人民日报的社论和党的生活栏的文章，已经新华社于当天播发出去的，在许多对开的大型报纸上都久久未见发表。对于这个思想战线上的大事根本不作声，是完全不应该的。
    属于第三类的显著的例子之一是平原日报。武训的原籍堂邑县现属平原省聊城专区。满清以来的封建统治者曾极力在这里宣传“武训精神”，其影响是流传至今，不可忽视的。而且既然武训生活及兴学活动主要在今平原省境，则搜集一些直接材料和农民群众对武训的反映发表出来，也是极有价值的。但平原日报却直至六月三日都没有发表或转载任何关于讨论武训传问题的材料，这岂不是一种对于重要事件的疏忽么？
    对于武训传的讨论，完全不加注意是不对的。省级的报纸也应该发表有关这个问题的必要的材料，作通俗的解说，并根据本地区的情况，适当地领导关于这个问题的讨论。
