Report of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government on the Summary of Work in 1950 and the Guidelines and Tasks for 1951
(Report by Vice Minister Qian Zhiguang at the 68th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on January 19, 1951, approved by the same meeting)
        (1) Summary of Work in 1950
　　In 1950, the textile industry experienced a process from difficulty to recovery and improvement. Before March, prices were not yet stable, and the rise in raw materials often exceeded that of finished products, resulting in a disconnection between the price ratio of cotton and yarn, wool tops and wool fabrics, and raw hemp and products. Many textile factories were operating at a loss, generally in a state of struggling to maintain operations. After March, due to the national financial unification and price stabilization, the false purchasing power represented by speculative activities disappeared. However, actual sales did not increase. During this transition period, poorly managed private factories found it difficult to sustain themselves. The Central People's Government correctly pointed out the need to adjust industry and commerce and public-private relations, and provided strong support in various aspects, planned to purchase cotton domestically and internationally, supplied raw materials, purchased yarn and sacks, expanded commissioned spinning and weaving, increased processing fees, ordered wool fabrics and blankets, and issued loans. At the same time, it assisted private factories in their own transformation, and the workers also helped the capitalists improve production and overcome difficulties in the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital. Therefore, the wool textile industry was able to maintain itself, and the cotton and linen textile industry was able to move from loss to break-even and gradually achieve profits.

　　After August, due to the national bumper harvest, the purchasing power of farmers began to increase, the demand for yarn and cloth increased, and the price ratio of cotton yarn became favorable to production. At the same time, the demand for sacks surged, and coupled with the large increase in cotton and raw hemp production, the raw materials that had previously relied on foreign supply were close to self-sufficiency. Therefore, the cotton and linen textile industry was able to rapidly move towards full recovery. Public and private cotton textile factories in East China successively resumed full operation from October, and some public and private factories in the inland areas gradually switched to three shifts. National public and private cotton textile factories completed 121.99% of the annual cotton yarn production plan, exceeding the pre-war highest annual output (1930) by 0.28%. 103.64% of the cotton cloth production plan was completed, exceeding the pre-war highest annual output (1936) by 7.8%. Public and private sack factories also produced in large quantities after October, and Zhejiang established new factories to increase production. The raw materials required by the wool textile industry have also changed the past situation of relying entirely on foreign supplies by advocating the use of domestic wool. Furthermore, due to national orders and the gradual recovery of the market, the wool products produced have also found outlets. The textile machinery manufacturing industry also has organized division of labor and unified the manufacturing specifications of textile machinery due to large-scale national orders, laying the foundation for mass manufacturing.

　　Over the past year, we have carried out preliminary democratic reforms, and most public and private textile factories have abolished the body search system. Seventy-four of the eighty-eight state-owned textile factories nationwide have established factory management committees; private factories have also successively established labor-management consultation meetings. Workers have initially realized that they are the masters of the factory, and labor productivity has rapidly increased. The average unit yarn output (20-count yarn for 20 hours) of state-owned factories has reached more than one pound, and the cloth output has reached more than 90 yards, exceeding the highest level during the Japanese puppet regime. The unit yarn output (20-count yarn for 20 hours) of some private factories has also exceeded one pound, and the cloth output has exceeded 85 yards, breaking historical records. During the shock production period, patriotic competitions were carried out with leadership and organization, giving full play to the strength and wisdom of the workers, overcoming difficulties, exceeding the tasks stipulated by the state, and ensuring the supply of yarn and cloth.

　　Over the past year, in accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, public-private relations have been adjusted, and professional meetings such as cotton, wool, hemp, reproduction, and printing and dyeing have been convened to rationally supply raw materials and allocate production tasks, and to manage the production of national public and private textile factories with planned control figures. In this series of professional meetings, technical experts from national public and private factories also participated in formulating operating standards for cotton, wool, hemp, printing and dyeing, knitting, and underwear, and tried them out nationwide. Other technical specialized meetings, such as cotton inspection and machinery and materials meetings, were also attended by technical experts from national public and private factories. Thus, the numbering, names, units, and specifications of machinery and materials were unified, and the grading inspection standards and procedures for cotton and raw hemp were initially determined. In addition, all previous meetings have encouraged the implementation of joint raw material purchases, which has resulted in the establishment of joint purchase committees for national cotton, raw hemp, and wool, with the participation of public and private capital, which has played a significant role in ensuring the supply of raw materials (especially wool and hemp), improving grades, stabilizing market prices, and taking care of farmers and merchants.

　　State-owned textile factories have cleared warehouses and assets, conducted preliminary valuations, implemented unified procurement and allocation of major machinery and materials, conducted general surveys, initially implemented a unified statistical reporting system, and formulated unified financial systems, accounting systems, and cost accounting procedures, preparing for the implementation of economic accounting systems in the future.

　　Due to the cooperation of the leadership and workers of state-owned enterprises and the efforts of private textile factories themselves, the abnormal state of "speculation over production" in the past has begun to change. Some have achieved streamlined organizations, improved management, increased production, and reduced costs. In addition, with the three adjustments of cotton yarn processing fees, from October, national cotton, hemp, reproduction, printing and dyeing and other private factories have obtained considerable profits, and some manufacturers in the inland have begun to add equipment and expand production.

　　Labor protection has also been gradually reformed. State-owned textile factories have generally improved and increased hospitals, clinics, medical equipment, sanitary equipment, steaming equipment, nurseries, dormitories, canteens, bathrooms, barbershops, cooperatives, children's primary schools, and employee evening schools; and urged private textile factories to improve safety and health equipment. The lives and health of workers have gradually improved. Taking the state-owned textile factories in Tianjin as an example, diseases and deaths decreased by 62% in 1950 compared to 1949. The expenditure on labor protection in state-owned textile factories in various places accounted for 12% to 15% of the total wages.

　　The work guideline for 1950 was mainly to restore production, improve management, and adjust public-private relations. These aspects have achieved significant results under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the cooperation of relevant parties. However, due to lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the business, there are also many shortcomings and deviations, the main ones being: in terms of democratic management, the idea of relying on the working class to do a good job in production is not clear enough, and the decision to establish factory management committees and labor-management consultation meetings has not been grasped and implemented firmly. For those who have not established factory management committees or labor-management consultation meetings, or although they have been established but have become a formality, they have not been checked and corrected in time; therefore, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of workers cannot be fully utilized, delaying the transformation of enterprises. Secondly, in the past production competition campaigns, workers in various places have created many good experiences and achieved significant results, but because the leadership has not established a system to consolidate it in time, most production competitions have not yet developed into a universal and regular movement. In addition, the work over the past year has been multi-faceted and the content is very rich, but there is no systematic summary and exchange of experience to correct deviations and promote experience, and to improve the work further, resulting in more general calls and arrangements, but less specific guidance, which has limited the progress of the work. In the work in 1951, these shortcomings must be overcome as much as possible.

　　中央人民政府纺织工业部
    关于一九五○年工作总结及一九五一年工作方针和任务的报告
    （一九五一年一月十九日钱之光副部长在政务院第六十八次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
            （一）一九五○年工作总结
    一九五○年的纺织工业，经历了从困难到恢复和好转的过程。三月以前，物价尚未稳定，原料上涨又往往超过成品，致使棉花与纱布、毛条与呢绒、原麻与产品之间的比价脱节，纺织工厂颇多不敷成本，一般是处于勉力维持的状态。三月以后，由于全国财政统一，物价稳定，投机活动所代表的虚假购买力已告消退，但实销未起，在此过渡期中，经营不善的私营厂家，曾感到难以支持。经中央人民政府正确指出调整工商业和公私关系，从各方面予以大力扶助，有计划地向国内外收购棉花，供应原料，收购纱布、麻袋，扩大代纺代织，提高加工费，进行呢绒毛毯的定货，发放贷款，同时协助私营厂家进行了自身改造，职工群众也以劳资两利的精神，帮助资方改进生产和克服困难。因此，毛纺织工业得以维持，棉麻纺织工业能从亏本达到保本，并逐渐获得盈利。
    八月以后，由于全国丰收，农民购买力开始提高，纱布需要量增加，花纱比价已有利生产，同时麻袋需要激增，再加棉花、原麻大量增产，一向仰赖国外供应的原料，已接近自给，故棉麻纺织工业能迅速走向全面恢复。华东各地公私营棉纺织厂自十月起先后全部复工，内地有部分公私营工厂已逐步改开三班。全国公私营棉纺织厂完成全年棉纱生产计划百分之一二一．九九，已超过战前最高年产量（一九三○年）百分之○．二八。完成棉布生产计划百分之一○三．六四，超过战前最高年产量（一九三六年）百分之七．八。公私营麻袋厂也自十月以后大量生产，浙江并建立新厂增加生产。毛纺织工业所需原料，经提倡采用国产羊毛，亦已改变过去全赖国外供应的状况，再由于国家定货及市场的逐渐恢复，所产毛织品亦获得了出路。纺织机械制造业也由于国家大批定货，全国现有公私营纺织机器厂，已有组织的分工制造，并统一了纺织机器的制造规格，奠定了大量制造的基础。
    一年来我们进行了初步的民主改革，公私营纺织厂大部已废除搜身制。全国八十八个国营纺织厂，已有七十四个工厂成立了工厂管理委员会；私营工厂也已先后成立劳资协商会议。职工群众已初步体会到自己是工厂中的主人，劳动生产率迅速提高。国营厂平均单位纱产量（二十支纱二十小时）已达一磅以上，布产量达九○码以上，超过日伪时期最高水平。有的私营厂单位纱产量（二十支纱二十小时）也已超过一磅，布产量在八十五码以上，打破了历来的纪录。在突击增产期间，有领导有组织地开展了爱国主义竞赛，发挥了职工群众的力量和智慧，克服了困难，超出了国家所规定的任务，保证了纱布的供应。
    一年来，根据公私兼顾原则，调整了公私关系，召开了棉、毛、麻、复制、印染等专业会议，合理供应原料与分配生产任务，以计划控制数字管理全国公私营纺织工厂的生产。在这一系列专业会议中，并会同全国公私营工厂技术专家，拟订棉、毛、麻、印染、针织、内衣等经营标准，在全国范围内试行。其他技术性专门会议，如棉花检验、机物料等会议，全国公私营厂也均有技术专家参加。从而统一了机物料的编号、名称、单位与规格，初步确定了棉花、原麻分级检验标准及规程。此外历次会议都曾鼓励实行原料联购，由此产生国棉、原麻、羊毛等联购委员会，吸收公私资本参加，对原料供应的保证（特别是毛、麻），品级的提高，市场价格的稳定，以及对农民商人的照顾等方面，都起了很大的作用。
    国营纺织厂清理了仓库与资财，进行了初步的估价，实行了主要机物料的统一采购与调拨，进行了普查工作，初步实施了统一的统计表报制度，制订了统一的财务制度、会计制度与成本计算规程，为今后推行经济核算制做了准备工作。
    由于国营企业的领导和职工的协力，私营纺织工厂自己的努力，开始改变过去“投机重于生产”的不正常状态，有的已做到紧缩机构，改善管理，生产有了提高，成本得以减低，再加以棉纱加工工缴费的三次调整，从十月份起，全国棉、麻、复制、印染等私营工厂，均获得了相当利润，内地有部分厂家开始增添设备，扩大生产。
    劳动保护方面，也经逐步改革。国营纺织厂则普遍改善和增加了医院、诊疗所、医疗设备、卫生设备、蒸饭设备、托儿所、宿舍、食堂、浴室、理发室、合作社、子弟小学校、职工业余学校等；并督促私营纺织工厂改进安全卫生设备。职工生活和健康因而逐步改善。以天津国营各纺织厂为例，一九五○年比一九四九年疾病与死亡减少百分之六十二。各地国营纺织厂的劳保费用支出占工资总额百分之十二至百分之十五。
    一九五○年的工作方针，是以恢复生产，改进管理与调整公私关系为主。这几方面，在中央人民政府的正确领导与有关方面的配合下，是有着显著成绩的。但由于经验缺少，业务不熟，存在的缺点和偏向也很多，其中主要的是：在民主管理方面，依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想不够明确，没有抓紧民主改革与贯彻执行建立工厂管理委员会与劳资协商会议的决定。对于未成立工厂管理委员会或劳资协商会议或虽已成立而流于形式的，都未能及时检查纠正；因此，职工的积极性与责任感，不能充分发挥，延缓了企业的改造。其次，在历次的生产竞赛运动中，各地的职工群众，都创造了许多好的经验，亦获得了显著的成绩，但由于领导上没有及时建立制度把它巩固起来，生产竞赛大多还没有发展成为普遍和经常的运动。此外一年来的工作，是多方面的，内容是很丰富的，但没有有系统的总结与交流经验，以纠正偏差与推广经验，把工作更提高一步，以致形成一般号召多、布置多，而具体指导少，使工作的进展，受到限制。在一九五一年的工作中，这些缺点必须尽力去克服的。
                                                   （未完）
