China Grain Company Tianjin Branch (formerly North China Regional Company), starting from October 1949, spent 1,344,600 jin of millet on the construction of a waterproof wall, a warehouse, and the installation of a grain drying machine. These projects were done very poorly. The waterproof wall cracked in more than fifty places last winter, and its ability to prevent water is very questionable. The warehouse leaks rain and snow. It has already been reworked four times, with no certainty of being fixed. The grain drying machine's temperature is too high, causing the grain to catch fire three times. It is still being modified.

Why did these problems occur? The main reason is that there was no serious investigation and research before the engineering design and construction. Take the waterproof wall engineering design as an example: the designer of this project, Ruan Qifei (the original North China Regional Company engineer), simply sat in his office and drew a very simple plan. He ignored all important issues related to engineering design, such as geological softness, terrain height, and climate. The area where the waterproof wall was built was originally silt deposited by the Hai River, and the soil quality was uneven. After construction, it was discovered that a 70-meter section of the wall base on the south side had water flowing at a depth of two to three feet. They had to temporarily drive wooden piles or lay broken bricks underground to remedy the situation. The original engineering design stipulated that the wall base should be one meter deep and the wall height should be two meters. However, after construction, it was discovered that the foundation of the 1,700-meter-long waterproof wall was uneven. If it were carried out according to the original plan, the wall would be high in some places and low in others. At this time, Ruan Qifei reduced the depth of the wall base to increase the height of the wall in low-lying areas to maintain the integrity of the wall. As a result, the wall base in some places was very shallow and unstable. Coupled with the geological and climatic conditions, the waterproof wall cracked in more than fifty places last winter, and the largest cracks could fit fingers. A project costing 550,000 jin of millet has thus fallen into a state of disrepair. The warehouse leaks rain and snow, and has been reworked four times, but the reason is still unknown. The grain drying machine was shipped from East China, and the original object for drying was rice; however, in Tianjin, the main things dried are corn and millet. The grain being dried is different, but the machine has not been adjusted. In addition, the running speed of the drying tower, an important part of the machine, is inconsistent, and the temperature inside the tower is too high, so the grain has caught fire three times. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished quickly, and no major disaster occurred.

Another reason for the engineering failure is that some leading comrades felt that they did not understand technology, so they handed over all technical matters to so-called "specialists." They adopted an irresponsible attitude during the engineering process. After paying the money, they thought everything was fine, waiting only for the project to be completed, without seriously checking. When the waterproof wall cracked, they only repaired it. When the warehouse leaked, they rebuilt it. When the grain drying machine caught fire, they reinstalled it. Until now, they have not fundamentally investigated the reasons or studied how to solve the problem, allowing the state's wealth to be wasted and tied up in these uncertain and long-unfinished projects. The re-installed grain drying machine's drying tower heat and cooling tower coldness, and even the machine's revolutions per minute, are still based on approximate estimates, without scientific experiments and calculations. Some people say, "This has been going on for a long time, why bother mentioning it now?" It is precisely because it has been going on for a long time and has not been resolved until now, that this issue deserves more attention. (Lu Hao)

　　中国粮食公司天津市公司兴办三项工程都遭失败
       陆灏
    中国粮食公司天津市公司（前华北区公司），从一九四九年十月开始，建筑防水墙、仓库和按装烤干机的工程，先后用了一百三十四万四千六百斤小米。这些工程做得非常不好；防水墙去年冬天裂缝五十多道，能不能防水，很成问题。仓库是下雨漏雨，下雪漏雪，现已返工四次，尚无把握修好。烤干机热度过高，已使粮食着火三次，至今还在改装。
    为什么发生了这样的问题呢？主要原因，是在工程设计与施工之前，没有认真地进行调查研究。举防水墙工程设计为例：该工程设计者阮启非（原华北区公司的工程师），只是坐在办公室里，画了一张十分简单的平面图。对于地质松硬、地形高低、气候等有关工程设计的重要问题，他一概不管。防水墙的工程地区，原是海河淤泥积成，土质松软不一。施工之后，才发现南面七十多公尺长的一段墙基，挖地二、三尺深就有流水；临时只好在地下打木椿或铺碎砖补救。原工程设计规定墙基一律深一公尺，墙身高二公尺。但施工后才发现长达一千七百余公尺的防水墙地基是高低不平的；如果按原计划进行，墙身就会有的地方高，有的地方低。这时，阮启非就用减少墙基的深度的办法来增加低洼处墙身的高度，以保持墙的整齐；这样，有的地方的墙基就很浅很不牢固了。加以地质和气候的关系，去冬防水墙裂缝五十多道，最大的裂缝能伸入手指。化费五十五万斤小米的工程，就这样陷于残废状态。仓库漏雨漏雪，已返工四次，至今还不知道原因何在。烤干机是由华东运来的，原来烘粮的对象是大米；而在天津则主要是烘玉蜀黍和小米。烘的粮食不同了，机器却没有调整。加以机器重要部分烘燥塔的运行速度不一致，塔内温度过高，因此烧着了三次粮食。幸亏扑灭得快，没有弄成大灾。
    工程失败的另外一个原因，是有些领导同志觉得自己不懂技术，就把一切有关技术的事全都交给所谓“专门家”去办理。他们在工程设施过程中，采取了一种不负责任的态度。如数付款以后，就以为万事大吉，只等工程完工，不去认真检查。防水墙裂缝了，只以修补了事；仓库漏了，返工重建；烤干机起火，重新按装。直到现在，还没有从根本上去追究是什么原因，研究应该如何设法解决，坐使国家的财富浪费和积压在这些没有把握的久久不能完工的工程上。正在重装的烤干机工程，其烘燥塔的热度和冷却塔的冷度，以至机器的转数，都仍是依靠大约的估计，而没有实行科学的实验和计算。有人说：“这事已经发生很久了，现在何必还提它？”正因为发生已经很久，而直到现在尚未解决，所以这个问题更值得注意。            （陆灏）
