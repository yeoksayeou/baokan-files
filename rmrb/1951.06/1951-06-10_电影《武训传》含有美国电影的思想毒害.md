    The Film "The Life of Wu Xun" Contains the Ideological Poison of American Films
    To the Editors:
    During the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" at our International News Bureau, two overseas Chinese comrades believed that the film "The Life of Wu Xun" contains serious ideological toxins from American films. For example, the film depicts Wu Xun's "thirty years of unremitting effort" eventually leading to the establishment of "free schools." How different is this from the idea of "newsboy makes good, endures hardship alone, and finally becomes president" often propagated in reactionary Hollywood films and many reactionary American books and periodicals? These types of novels popular in the United States numb many poor people into "dutifully" "striving." This reactionary theory of concealing class contradictions, abolishing class struggle, and encouraging "individual hard work" and "where there's a will, there's a way" is precisely what the American ruling class vigorously promotes. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" also contains similar viewpoints. Therefore, one comrade said, "If this film were shown in the United States, it would be greatly welcomed by the rulers, because this is exactly what Hollywood films want to promote."
    Regarding the possible impact of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," we offer the above opinions from this perspective as a reference for Mr. Sun Yu to conduct a profound self-criticism.

    To the Editors:
    I think "The Life of Wu Xun" is deeply poisoned by American film ideology. Wu Xun sleepwalking in hell and heaven, waking up with great enlightenment, and Wu Xun's romance with Xiao Tao, which is full of "poetry" and "tragedy," are all influenced by American films. Wu Xun's "dedication" for thirty years, finally achieving "where there's a will, there's a way," is no different from the "rags to riches" "dedication" promoted by American masters. I think this film would be very popular with the American government if it were shown in the United States. I hope our film industry, through the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," will further eliminate the remaining bad influences of reactionary American films on our film directing work.

### 电影《武训传》含有美国电影的思想毒害

    电影《武训传》含有美国电影的思想毒害编辑同志：
    我们国际新闻局在关于《武训传》的讨论中，有两位华侨同志认为电影《武训传》包含着严重的美国电影的思想毒素，如电影中描写武训“三十年如一日”，终于达到办“义学”的目的，这和反动的好莱坞影片及美国许多反动的书刊上，所常宣扬的“卖报童子，只身苦门，终于做大总统”的思想有多少不同呢？美国所风行的这类小说，麻醉着不少贫苦的人去“安份守己”地去“奋斗”。这种掩盖阶级对立，取消阶级斗争，鼓励“个人苦斗”，“有志者事竟成”的反动理论，正是美国统治阶级所大事鼓吹的。而电影《武训传》也包含了和这类似的观点。所以有位同志说：“假如把这部影片拿到美国上演，一定会大受统治者的欢迎，因为这正是好莱坞影片所要宣扬的”。
    关于《武训传》影片所可能产生的影响，我们从这个角度提供以上意见，作为孙瑜先生作深刻检讨时的参考。
                                          国际新闻局  陈封雄编辑同志：
    我认为《武训传》受了美国电影很深的思想毒害。像武训梦游地狱、天堂，醒来大觉大悟，武训与小桃搞恋爱，富有“诗意”和“悲剧性”，都是受了美国影片影响的。武训三十年如一日的“事业心”，终于“有志者事竟成”，这与美国老爷鼓吹的“叫化子成百万富翁”的“事业心”，没有什么不同，我想这部影片如果拿到美国去演，一定很受美国政府的欢迎。我希望我们的电影界从对《武训传》的批判进而肃清美国反动影片在我们电影编导工作上残存的恶劣影响。
