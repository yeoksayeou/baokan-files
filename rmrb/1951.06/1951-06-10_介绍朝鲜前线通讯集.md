　　Introducing Collection of Frontline Dispatches from Korea
    Mai Tang
    Since the outbreak of the war in Korea last year, we have read many good dispatches in major newspapers and periodicals across the country. These are the brave and diligent works of our excellent journalists, forged in the fires of war. These dispatches have written about the heroic deeds of our soldiers, their boundless loyalty and love for the motherland, for the people of the motherland, and for the Korean people, and their incomparable hatred for American imperialism. They have written about our soldiers' noble spirit of self-sacrifice and their lofty patriotism and internationalism. These dispatches have played a huge educational role among readers.
    The China Peace Committee selected and compiled these dispatches into different volumes for publication, and combined them with relevant necessary papers, war reports, commendation orders, and other documents and photographs, which is of great significance. Now, let me briefly introduce the contents of the already published Volumes 1 to 7.
    Volume 1: "Fighting for the Motherland, Fighting for the Korean People." Contains fifteen dispatches. In October last year, when the American invading army extended the flames of war to our motherland's border, our people, in an emergency where forbearance was no longer possible, formed the Volunteer Army, crossed the Yalu River, and from October 25th, in the Yunshan and Wenjing areas of northern Korea, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, launched a heroic counterattack against the American invading army. This campaign lasted half a month, eliminating more than 10,000 enemies and forcing them to retreat in panic south of the Cheongcheon River. The content of the first volume records the situation of this campaign.
    Volume 2: "Breaking Ice and Crossing the Cheongcheon River by Force," is a report on the heroic battle deeds on the western front of the Second Campaign. This volume compiles more than twenty dispatches and other materials, systematically and specifically recording how our Volunteer Army, targeting MacArthur's so-called "total offensive to end the war" before Christmas, launched a fierce counterattack on November 25th, heavily damaging various enemy forces; how they quickly halted the enemy's offensive and turned themselves into a counter-offensive, ultimately turning the enemy's total offensive into a total rout. In this campaign, we eliminated more than 20,000 enemies, seized the opportunity to recover Pyongyang, and cleared the remaining enemies north of Pyongyang.
    Volume 3: "Fighting on the Shores of Changjin Lake," includes seventeen dispatches, recording how our Volunteer Army on the eastern front, in coordination with the large-scale counter-offensive on the western front, successively launched offensives from November 27th last year, heavily striking the elite troops of the American invading army, the 1st Marine Division and the 7th and 3rd Infantry Divisions. Starting from Changjin Lake, they fought for more than twenty days and nights, completely driving the American forces on the eastern front into the sea. The four dispatches reporting the Huangcaoling blocking battle are also compiled in this volume.
    Volume 4: "Breaking Through the 38th Parallel, Advance Again and Again," records how our Volunteer Army, in the powerful New Year Offensive launched on New Year's Eve last year, broke through the heavily defended "38th Parallel" of the American invading army, creating a gap in the enemy's four-hundred-mile front, and killing their way into the depths, dividing and encircling the enemy for heavy damage. It also records how they broke through the enemy's second line of defense in Uijeongbu and Chuncheon, captured Seoul in one fell swoop, crossed the Han River, and recovered many important towns, ports, and vast lands south of the Han River. This volume contains a total of eighteen dispatches.
    Volume 5: "Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River." The ten dispatches in this volume are longer in length and more complete in structure. The content mainly records the heroic and moving deeds in the blocking battle on both sides of the Han River, lasting forty-nine days from January 25th to March 14th this year. In this battle, the enemy used more than 230,000 troops, equipped with a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, to invade northward. A portion of our heroic and well-fighting Volunteer Army, in order to kill a large number of enemy forces, guarded the position day and night, enduring hunger and cold, and constantly counterattacked the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing 50,000 enemies, making the losses of the American invading army exceed the sum of the previous three campaigns.
    Volume 6: "How Did We Defeat the Enemy?", mainly explaining the reasons why we will inevitably win. The dispatches in this volume tell us that the enemy is an imperialism armed to the teeth. They hold weapons superior to our army and maintain the advantage of naval and air forces. Our victory is not easily won, but through arduous struggle.
    Volume 7: "The Rear on the Korean Front." This volume of dispatches unfolds the scene of the rear in Korea for us. Tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people who are fighting for the security of the motherland and world peace, forming transportation teams, stretcher teams, rescue teams, surgical teams... with unparalleled enthusiasm, braving the enemy's round-the-clock frenzied bombing and harassment, working effectively with selfless spirit in extremely difficult and dangerous situations, ensuring the victory of the front.
    These seven volumes, each with only two or three hundred thousand words, pocket-sized, and the paper, printing, and binding are all satisfactory. Some articles seem to have been appropriately revised in language, making them more clear and easy to read. I sincerely congratulate the publication of this set of books. At the same time, I hope that the Korean dispatches recently published in newspapers and periodicals will also be compiled and printed as soon as possible.

    Editor's Note: "Collection of Frontline Dispatches from Korea" is published by People's Publishing House. The price of each volume ranges from 2,000 yuan to 3,500 yuan.

　　介绍朝鲜前线通讯集
    麦唐
    从去年朝鲜的战争爆发以来，在全国各重要报纸期刊上，我们读到了很多好的通讯，这是我们的优秀的新闻工作者们在战争炮火的锻炼中勇敢辛勤的劳作。这些通讯，写出了我们的战士的英勇战斗事迹，写出了我们的战士对祖国、对祖国人民、对朝鲜人民无限的忠诚热爱，和对美帝国主义的无比仇恨，写出了我们的战士的崇高的自我牺牲精神和崇高的爱国主义、国际主义的思想品质。这些通讯在读者中起了巨大的教育作用。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会把这些通讯，选编分辑，陆续出版，并配合上有关的必要的论文、战报、表扬令等文献和照片，这是极有意义的。现在把已经出版的一至七辑的内容分别扼要地介绍一下。
    第一辑：“为祖国而战，为朝鲜人民而战”。包含通讯十五篇。在去年十月间，当美国侵略军把战火延伸到我们祖国边疆时，我国人民在忍无可忍的紧急情况下，组成志愿军，越过鸭绿江，从十月二十五日起，在朝鲜北部云山、温井一带，配合朝鲜人民军，向美国侵略军展开英勇的反击。这次战役历时半月，歼敌一万余，迫使敌人仓皇撤退到清川江以南。第一辑的内容就是记述这一次战役的情形。
    第二辑：“破冰涉水强渡清川江”，是第二次战役西线战场英勇战斗事迹的报道。本辑汇集通讯和其他材料二十余篇，系统地、具体地纪录了我志愿军怎样对准麦克阿瑟所部署的所谓圣诞节以前“结束战争总攻势”，于十一月二十五日奋起反击，重创各路敌人；怎样迅速停止了敌人的进攻，而使自己转入反攻，最后使敌人的总攻势变成总溃退。是役我歼敌两万余人，乘胜收复平壤，扫清了平壤以北的残敌。
    第三辑：“战斗在长津湖畔”，计通讯十七篇，纪录我东线志愿军配合西线的大反攻，于去年十一月二十七日起相继发动攻势，沉重地打击了美国侵略军精锐部队海军陆战队第一师及步兵第七师，第三师，从长津湖打起，奋战二十余昼夜，把东线美军完全赶下海去。报道黄草岭阻击战的四篇通讯，也汇集在这一辑中：
    第四辑：“突破三八线，前进再前进”，是纪录我志愿军于去年除夕展开的强大的新年攻势中，怎样突破美国侵略军重重设防的“三八线”，在敌四百里正面防线上突破缺口，一齐杀向纵深地，将敌军分割包围予以重创，又怎样突破议政府、春川敌第二道防线，一鼓攻下汉城，并跨过汉江，收复许多重要城镇、港口及汉江南岸广大土地。这一辑的通讯共十八篇。
    第五辑：“汉江南岸的日日夜夜”。这一辑的十篇通讯，字数较多，结构也较完整。内容主要是纪录自今年一月二十五日起至三月十四日止历时四十九天的汉江两岸阻击战中可歌可泣的英勇事迹。此役，敌人使用了二十三万多人的兵力，配以大量的飞机、大炮、坦克向北进犯，我一部分英勇善战的志愿军为大量杀伤敌人的有生力量，不分昼夜，忍饥耐寒，扼守阵地，并不断反击敌人，毙、伤、俘敌达五万人，使美国侵略军的损失超过了以前三次战役的总和。
    第六辑：“我们是怎样战胜敌人的？”，主要在说明我们必然会获得胜利的原因。这一辑的通讯告诉我们：敌人是武装到了牙齿的帝国主义，他们握有比我军优良的武器，保有海空军的优势，我们的胜利并不是轻易得来的，而是经过了艰苦的斗争而得来的。
    第七辑：“在朝鲜前线的后方”。这辑的通讯，为我们展开了朝鲜后方的情景。成千成万为祖国安全和世界和平而战斗的中国人民的优秀儿女，他们组成的运输队、担架队、救护队、手术队……以无比的热情，冒着敌机昼夜疯狂的轰炸袭扰，在极其困难艰险的情况下，以忘我的精神，有效的工作，保证前线的胜利的。
    这七辑，每辑的字数不过二三万，袖珍本，用纸、印刷、装订都使人满意。有些篇在文字上好像经过了适当的修改，因之更为明白易读。我衷心庆贺这一套书的出版。同时希望把最近一两个月在报纸期刊上发表的朝鲜通讯也赶快编选印出。
