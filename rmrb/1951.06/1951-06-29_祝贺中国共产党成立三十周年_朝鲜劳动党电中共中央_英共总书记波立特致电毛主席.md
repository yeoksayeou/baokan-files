　　Congratulations on the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
	The Workers' Party of Korea Sends a Telegram to the CPC Central Committee

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th - The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 27th, congratulating the Communist Party of China on its 30th anniversary. The telegram reads as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

    On the occasion of the glorious 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, on behalf of all party members and the entire Korean people, extends warm and militant congratulations to your party, all your party members, and the heroic Chinese people.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the heroic Chinese people, after thirty years of arduous revolutionary struggle, have achieved epoch-making and brilliant victories in overthrowing the reactionary Kuomintang regime and expelling the American imperialist aggressors, and have established a new, free, and unified people's China, becoming a powerful force in safeguarding world peace, security, national independence, and freedom, making the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union even more consolidated.

    The people of Korea and China, who share common beliefs and aspirations for peace, freedom, and national prosperity, are engaged in a heroic struggle against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors, who are attempting to take away the freedom and victories they have already achieved. In this struggle, the brotherly friendship and unity forged by the two peoples in history have been further consolidated.

    We express our deep brotherly gratitude and congratulations to the great Chinese people and their leader, the Communist Party of China, for providing us with brotherly combat assistance during the most difficult period of the Korean people's struggle against the American bandits and their lackeys.

    We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Workers' Party of Korea, the people of China and Korea will surely annihilate and expel the common enemy and win victory, so as to guarantee the democratic development and prosperity of China and Korea; at the same time, contribute to world peace and security, especially the peace, security, national independence, and freedom of the people of all ethnic groups in Asia.

    For the unlimited prosperity and development of the People's China and for world peace, security, democracy, and freedom, we wish your party even greater achievements in its future endeavors.
         Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea

    Xinhua News Agency, 28th - Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao congratulating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade,

    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, on behalf of all members of our party, extends our heartfelt brotherly congratulations.

    We have always watched with great enthusiasm and admiration the progress made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

    In Britain—whose ruling class has always been the most greedy exploiter of the people of Asia, and which still attempts to maintain its oppression by force—we recognize that your achievements herald the end of imperialist rule.

    The British imperialists are today following their imperialist masters in America, actively supporting American aggression in Korea, occupying Taiwan, rearming Japan, and proposing illegal treaties with Japan. They have caused a virtual trade isolation between our two countries, hindering the British economy; they pretend to recognize the Chinese People's Government but refuse to expel Chiang Kai-shek's "representatives" from the United Nations.

    All this is not only an act of hostility towards the Chinese people, but it also brings poverty and danger to the British people, dragging them into a war that will destroy Britain. The new Chinese government, led by the Communist Party of China and enthusiastically supported by the people, is today one of the greatest bulwarks of world peace. An increasingly prosperous and free People's China, with the peaceful construction, prosperity, and happiness of a country freed from the shackles of imperialism, sets a shining example to the whole world, especially to the struggling colonial peoples.

    In congratulating you, we pledge to work tirelessly to win the friendship between our peoples, so that we ourselves may soon join the great Soviet Union, the People's China, and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries in building socialism and ensuring lasting peace.

    Long live the friendship between the British and Chinese people!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!
        Yours in communist greetings,
          Your brother, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, H. Pollitt
            June 7, 1951

　　祝贺中国共产党成立三十周年
    朝鲜劳动党电中共中央
    英共总书记波立特致电毛主席
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会于二十七日致电中国共产党中央委员会，祝贺中国共产党成立三十周年。电文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：
    欣逢光荣的中国共产党成立三十周年之际，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会谨代表全体党员与全朝鲜人民，向贵党及贵党全体党员与英勇的中国人民，致以热烈的战斗的祝贺。
    英勇的中国人民在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，经过三十年的艰苦革命斗争，已经取得了打倒国民党反动政权与驱逐美帝国主义侵略者的划时代的光辉胜利，建立了新的、自由统一的人民中国，成为维护世界和平安全与民族独立自由的强大力量，使得以苏联为首的国际民主阵营更加巩固了。
    对于和平自由与民族繁荣有着共同信念与愿望的朝、中两国人民，正与妄图夺去他们所已经取得的自由与胜利的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者，进行着英勇的斗争。在这一斗争中，两国人民在历史上所结成的兄弟般的友谊团结，获得了进一步的巩固。
    我们向在朝鲜人民反抗美国强盗及其走狗的斗争的最艰难的时期，给予我们兄弟般的战斗援助的伟大的中国人民及其领导者中国共产党，表示深切的兄弟般的感谢与祝贺。
    我们相信在中国共产党与朝鲜劳动党的领导下，中、朝两国人民一定会歼灭、驱逐共同的敌人而赢得胜利，以保障朝、中两国的民主发展与繁荣；同时，贡献于世界和平与安全，特别是亚洲各族人民的和平安全与民族的独立自由。
    为了人民中国的无限繁荣发展和世界的和平安全与民主自由，谨祝贵党在今后的事业中取得更巨大的成果。
          朝鲜劳动党中央委员会
    【新华社二十八日讯】英国共产党总书记波立特致电毛主席祝贺中国共产党三十周年纪念。全文如下：亲爱的同志：
    值此中国共产党三十周年纪念之际，英国共产党执行委员会谨代表我党全体党员致以衷心的兄弟的祝贺。
    我们一向怀着高度的热诚和钦佩来注视伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的领导下所获得的进步。
    在英国——它的统治阶级一向是亚洲人民的最贪婪的剥削者，目前并仍然企图凭借武力来维持其压迫——我们承认，你们的成就宣告着帝国主义统治的终结。
    英帝国主义者今天正在尾随它在美洲的帝国主义主子，他们积极支持美国侵略朝鲜，占领台湾、重新武装日本以及提出对日缔结非法和约。他们使我们两国间在贸易上的实际隔绝，阻碍了英国的经济；他们虽佯装承认中国人民政府，却拒绝将蒋介石的“代表”逐出联合国。
    这一切不仅是敌视中国人民的行为，它们同时招致英国人民的贫困和危险，将他们曳进一次势将毁灭英国的战争。由中国共产党领导并取得全国人民热烈拥护的新中国政府，今天是最伟大的世界和平堡垒之一。日愈繁荣并享有自由的人民中国，以一个挣脱了帝国主义羁绊的国家的和平建设、繁荣和愉快向全世界，尤其是正在斗争的殖民地人民昭示一个光辉的榜样。
    在向你们致贺时，我们宣誓，要不懈地工作以争取我们人民之间的友谊，使得我们自己可以早日和伟大的苏联，人民的中国以及东欧人民民主主义国家一道，进行社会主义的建设和保障持久和平。
    英中人民友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东同志万岁！
        即致
    共产主义敬礼
          你的兄弟  英国共产党总书记  Ｈ·波立特
            一九五一年六月七日
