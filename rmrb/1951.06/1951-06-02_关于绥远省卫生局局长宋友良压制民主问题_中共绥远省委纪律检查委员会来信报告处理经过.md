　　Regarding the issue of Song Youliang, Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau, suppressing democracy

Letter from the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Committee reporting the handling process

Comrade Editor:

　　On January 22nd, your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column published a reader's criticism of Song Youliang, Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau. We are now informing you of Comrade Song Youliang's mistakes and our handling of the situation.

　　Comrade Song Youliang's political studies are usually very poor, and he has serious non-proletarian consciousness and a baggage of blind arrogance. He suppresses democracy and adopts an attitude of attacking and excluding those who offer him opinions. For example, when Comrade Geng Shida, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau Branch, offered him opinions, he accused Geng Shida of "substituting the Party for the government." When Comrade Dai Shiping offered him opinions at a branch committee meeting, he said after the meeting that Dai Shiping was "taking advantage of the situation." In implementing the cadre policy, he often starts from personal feelings, believing that cadres who listen to him are good cadres, and harboring dissatisfaction towards cadres who have offered him opinions. When his undesirable work style was discovered and opinions for correction were put forward within the Party and administratively, not only did he not humbly examine his mistakes and accept the Party's opinions, but he also resisted by using the excuse of being busy and having no time, and even by offering his resignation. His mistakes have seriously affected Party unity, Party-masses relations, and the work enthusiasm of cadres, and have damaged the prestige of the Party and the government among the people.

　　We discovered Comrade Song Youliang's mistakes a year ago, but failed to handle them in a timely manner, which also caused undue losses to our work. At the beginning, because we did not deeply understand the situation, we did not fully recognize the seriousness of his mistakes and did not seize the opportunity to deal with them. Last November, we understood the situation and seized the opportunity to deal with this matter; however, due to Comrade Song Youliang's resistance, the problem was not resolved. On January 20th of this year, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission meeting discussed this issue and talked with Comrade Song Youliang to continue to resolve this problem. The criticism in the newspaper on January 22nd further prompted us to work with relevant government departments to seize the opportunity to deal with this issue. During the handling process, in order to effectively resolve Comrade Song Youliang's leadership thinking and work style, ideological struggles were carried out within the Party to help him recognize his mistakes; administratively, all cadres also held several days of discussions on his mistakes. These measures gave Comrade Song Youliang great education and help. We have now not only ordered him to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism and write a written report, but also, with the approval of the North China Bureau Discipline Inspection Commission, given him a public warning; in addition, we have also suggested that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government give him a dismissal penalty.

　　Finally, the reader's letter stated that Song Youliang promoted Suo Huaiyu to be the captain of the epidemic prevention team due to hometown ties, which is not true. Suo Huaiyu was originally the director of medical affairs in Suidong, and his transfer to the captain of the epidemic prevention team was proposed by Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and passed by the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government's administrative meeting. Although Suo Huaiyu and Song Youliang are both from Suiyuan Province, their ancestral homes are not in the same county or neighboring counties, and they had not known each other in the past.

### 关于绥远省卫生局局长宋友良压制民主问题  中共绥远省委纪律检查委员会来信报告处理经过

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　关于绥远省卫生局局长宋友良压制民主问题
    中共绥远省委纪律检查委员会来信报告处理经过编辑同志：
    一月二十二日贵报《读者来信》栏发表了一读者对绥远省卫生局局长宋友良的批评。现将宋友良同志所犯错误及我们的处理情况告诉你们。
    宋友良同志平时政治学习很差，有严重的非无产阶级意识和盲目自傲的思想包袱。他压制民主，对向他提意见的人采取打击、排斥态度。如中共绥远省卫生局支部副书记耿士达同志向他提意见，他就指责耿士达“以党代政”；戴士平同志在一次支部委员会议上向他提意见，他在会后就说戴士平是“趁火打劫”。他在执行干部政策上，常以个人感情出发，认为听自己话的是好干部，对向自己提过意见的干部则心怀不满。当党内及行政上发现了他的不良作风而提出纠正意见时，他不仅不虚心检讨错误，接受党的意见，反而借口工作忙、无时间，甚至以提出辞职来抗拒。他的错误，严重地影响了党内团结、党群关系，和干部的工作积极性，损害了党和政府在人民群众中的威信。
    我们发现宋友良同志的错误已有一年，但未能及时处理，这也使工作受到不应有的损失。开始时，由于我们没有深入了解情况，对他错误的严重性认识不足，没有抓紧处理。去年十一月，我们了解了情况，抓紧处理这件事；但因宋友良同志的抗拒，使问题没得到解决。今年一月二十日，省委纪律检查委员会会议上对此问题进行了讨论，并找宋友良同志谈话，继续解决这个问题。一月二十二日报纸上的批评更促使我们与政府各有关部门共同抓紧处理这个问题。处理过程中，为了有效地解决宋友良同志的领导思想与作风等问题，党内开展了思想斗争，帮助他认识错误；在行政上，全体干部又对他的错误展开了几天的讨论。这些措施，给了宋友良同志很大的教育和帮助。我们现在除责成他继续深入检讨，写出书面报告外，并经华北局纪律检查委员会批准，给以当众警告处分；此外，又建议绥远省人民政府予以撤职处分。
    最后，一读者来信中所说宋友良因同乡关系提拔索怀玉为防疫大队长一事，并非事实。索怀玉原任绥东医务主任，调任防疫大队长是由绥远省人民政府杨植霖副主席等提议，省人民政府政务会议通过的。索怀玉和宋友良虽然都是绥远省人，但原籍并非同县或邻县，过去也不相识。
