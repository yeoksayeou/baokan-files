　　Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: TASS Washington, June 19th: The eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, who were sentenced to imprisonment, have formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, demanding a retrial of their case.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: TASS New York, June 17th: In the United States, the movement protesting the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the shameful verdict against the eleven Communist leaders continues to develop. The "National Lawyers Guild" New York City branch's publication, *New York Lawyers* magazine, in its current issue, argues for a review of the case to save American civil liberties. The publication emphasizes that the Smith Act, on which the Department of Justice based its persecution of the eleven Communist leaders, clearly violates the Constitution.

　　The *Daily Worker* reports that several important American figures—artists, scientists, and freelancers—have jointly issued a statement saying: "We, the public, unanimously support the demand for the Supreme Court to review this case."

　　California Judge Moffat and seventeen writers, freelancers, and trade union personnel telegraphed Truman, requesting the President to order the Department of Justice to agree to a review. In Seattle, the executive committee of the "Washington Pension Association" unanimously declared that the Supreme Court's decision "judges that political minorities do not have rights that should be respected by the government." In Philadelphia, a group of local union leaders jointly issued a statement demanding a review. Six leaders of student groups at "Queens College" in New York City also demanded a review.

　　The current issue of *Masses and Mainstream* magazine published a statement signed by the magazine's editor, Sillen, and two other staff members. They condemned the Supreme Court's decision as a political decision aimed at destroying the forces opposing the government's advance towards fascism and world war. They called for the organization of the broadest possible united front to force a retrial of this shameful verdict, to win freedom for the eleven Communist leaders, and to save the Bill of Rights. The weekly *National Guardian* said in an editorial that the Supreme Court's decision repeated the trials by which Hitler came to power.

　　美共十一位领袖提出上诉要求重审
    美国人民继续抗议迫害美共领袖
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：被判决徒刑的美国共产党十一位领袖已向美国最高法院正式提出上诉，要求重审他们的案件。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：在美国，抗议最高法院决定维持对十一名共产党领袖的可耻判决的运动正在继续发展。“全国律师公会”纽约市分会的机关刊物《纽约律师》杂志本期撰论要求复审这个案件，以挽救美国的公民自由。该刊强调说：司法部为迫害十一位共产党领袖所根据的史密斯法案分明是违反宪法的。
    《工人日报》报道，若干美国重要人士——艺术家们，科学家们和自由职业者——共同发表一项声明，内称：“我们大众一致支持要求最高法院复审这个案件。”
    加利福尼亚州法官莫法特和十七名作家，自由职业者及工会人员等致电杜鲁门，要求总统命令司法部同意复审。在西雅图，“华盛顿养老金协会”执行委员会一致宣布：最高法院的决定，“判定了政治上的少数派没有应当为政府所尊重的权利”。在费城，一群工会的地方领袖们联名发表声明，要求复审。纽约市“皇后学院”学生团体的六位领袖也同样要求复审。
    本期《群众与主流》杂志发表了由该杂志编辑西伦和其它两位职员签名的一篇声明。他们斥责最高法院的决定是一个政治决定，目的在于摧毁反对政府向法西斯主义和世界战争前进的力量。他们号召组织极广泛的统一战线，强使这个可耻的判决能予重审，为十一位共产党领袖争取自由并挽救《人权法案》。《国民前卫》周刊在社论中说：最高法院的决定是重复了希特勒赖以当权的审讯案。
