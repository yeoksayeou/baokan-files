Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: According to TASS, Moscow, June 20th: Many enterprises throughout the Soviet Union have completed their six-month production plans ahead of schedule and are preparing to significantly increase production. Workers at the Moscow Ordzhonikidze Machine-Building Plant have decided to increase the June plan by 8 percent, aiming to produce ten more complex master machines and two sets of automated production devices, as well as installing a new experimental automated machine. The Baku United Textile Factory has already produced one million meters of textiles more than originally planned and has pledged to increase production by another one million meters of textiles this year. The Moscow "Female Shock Worker" Candy Factory, after completing its six-month plan, is striving to produce millions of rubles worth of products ahead of schedule by July 1st.

Many reformers of production methods have emerged in Soviet enterprises. At the Leningrad "Elektrosila" factory, one in three workers is a rationalization proposer, and advanced workers are striving to double production. Steelworkers in the Stalinino open-hearth furnace have mastered advanced production operating methods and smelted about 1,000 furnaces of steel using accelerated steelmaking methods in the first five months of this year, greatly improving the productivity of all equipment targeted for improvement. Over the past five years since the war, factories in Ulyanovsk on the Volga River have implemented 6,500 rationalization proposals, tripling total output and saving more than 43 million rubles. The local automobile factory alone has implemented hundreds of innovative suggestions this year, saving more than 1.5 million rubles.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20th: The Soviet Union's great communist construction projects are underway in full swing.

At the Volga-Don Canal, which will be completed this year, sluice gates are already being installed with water gates and various special equipment. Cement pouring is proceeding day and night, and excavation work is being carried out at three times the previous speed. One of the canal's main projects, the dozens of locks at Tsimlyanskaya, has been completed. Workers are speeding up the construction of the power plant building at the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station.

The foundation of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is under construction, and the breakwater being built on the Volga River has been completed. Highly efficient suction dredgers will be used to build special embankments to protect the underwater foundation. Near the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, a modern city has begun to be built, where ships from the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the White Sea will anchor in the future.

Along the 1 million-hectare area of the Turkmen Main Canal, surveying work is in full swing. Scientific work teams are surveying the canal route of more than 1,000 kilometers, studying the ancient Uzboy riverbed that the canal will pass through, investigating the soil and climate of the irrigation area, and selecting suitable locations for building cities. Scientists have discovered hundreds of thousands of hectares of fertile land. At the starting point of the canal, Takhia-Tash Cape, many docks have been built, and a new city is under construction. The second power station has been completed. A state farm covering 1,000 hectares has also been established near Takhia-Tash to supply agricultural products needed by canal workers.

Surveying work is underway on the South Ukrainian Canal to determine the canal's route. The main section of the canal – from the sluice gates of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station to the village of Terpeniye near Melitopol – currently has hundreds of topographers, geologists, drilling workers, etc., working. They have dug more than 200 test pits, extracting rock samples from depths of more than 100 meters for testing to determine the geological conditions of the area through which the canal will pass. Surveying work is also being intensified in the irrigation areas along the canal.

At the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, work has begun on building breakwaters and port facilities, and the construction of factories, warehouses, and residential areas is underway.

The Soviet people fully support the construction projects. The number of people requesting to participate in the work is increasing. Factories across the country are completing orders ahead of schedule and transporting generators, excavators, sluice gates, etc., to the construction sites. To meet the needs of the projects, the Soviet machine industry is constantly inventing and manufacturing powerful new machines, such as the giant mooring cable manufactured by the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, which can replace the work of 10,000 people; the suction dredger manufactured by the Moscow "Kalinin" Pump Factory can excavate enough soil in 24 hours to fill 1,000 train cars.

　　苏联许多企业提前完成六个月生产计划
    各地共产主义建设工程正全面进行中
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：全苏各地的许多企业都已提前完成了六个月的生产计划，正准备大量增加产品。莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则机器制造厂的职工们已决定把六月份计划提高百分之八，他们要多生产十架复杂的母机和两套自动化的生产装置，按装一架新的供实验用的自动机器。巴库联合纺织厂已比原定计划多生产了一百万公尺的纺织品，现已提出保证，要在今年内再增产一百万公尺纺织品。莫斯科“女突击队员”糖果工厂完成了六个月计划后，正争取在七月一日以前超计划生产数百万卢布的产品。
    苏联各企业涌现了许多生产方法的改革者。列宁格勒“电力”工厂每三个工人就有一个是合理化建议者，先进工人们正努力使生产增加一倍。斯大林诺的平炉炼钢工人掌握了进步的生产操作方法，在今年头五个月内就用加速炼钢法炼出了约一千炉钢，并且大大提高了预定要达到的全部装备的生产率。伏尔加河上的乌里杨诺夫斯克各工厂，在战后五年间已实施了六千五百个合理化建议，使总产量增为三倍，并节省了四千三百多万卢布。单是当地的汽车工厂在今年内就实施了数百件革新建议，节省了一百五十多万卢布。
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】苏联的伟大共产主义建设工程正在全面进行着。
    将在今年完成的伏尔加河—顿河运河，各处水闸已经开始装置水门和各种特殊的设备，浇灌水泥的工作昼夜不停，挖掘工作用三倍于前的速度进行着。运河的主要工作之一——齐姆良斯卡雅的数十段水闸工程已经完工。工人正在加紧建造齐姆良水电站的发电厂大厦。
    古比雪夫水电站正在建造地基，在伏尔加河上建筑的防波堤已经完成。人们将使用高效率的吸水挖泥机来建筑特别的堤岸，以保护水面下的地基。在斯大林格勒水电站的工地附近，已开始建设一座现代化的城市，将来从黑海、亚速海、里海、波罗的海和白海来的船只都在那里碇泊。
    在土库曼大运河沿线一百万公顷的地区，勘测工作正在全面进行。科学工作队在勘察一千多公里的运河线路、研究大运河要经过的古代乌兹波伊河床、考察灌溉区的土壤和气候、并选择建设城市的适宜的地点。科学家已发现了数十万公顷的肥沃土地。在运河的起点塔赫亚·塔什岬，已经建筑了许多码头，并且在建设着一座新城市，第二动力站已经竣工。在塔赫亚·塔什附近还建立了一座占地一千公顷的国家农场，以供应运河工人所需用的农业品。
    在南乌克兰运河正进行着测量工作以决定运河的路线。运河的主要干线地区——从第聂伯水电站的水闸到美利托波尔城的台尔培尼耶村，目前正有数百位地形学家、地质学家、钻孔工人等在工作着。他们已经挖掘了二百多个试验竖坑，从一百多公尺的深处，取出供试验用的岩石，以测定河道经过地区的地层状况。在运河沿线的灌溉地区，测量工作也在加紧进行。
    在卡霍夫卡水电站，建造防波堤和港口设备的工作已经开始，工厂、仓库和居民区的建设工作正在进行着。
    苏联人民全力支持建设工程。要求参加工作的人越来越多。各地工厂纷纷提前完成订货，把发电机挖掘机、水闸闸门等等运往工地。为了符合工程的需要，苏联的机器工业不断发明制造了强大的新机器，例如乌拉尔重型机械厂制造的巨大系留索，可以代替一万人的工作；莫斯科“加里宁”抽水机制造厂的吸水挖泥机，在二十四小时内挖掘的泥土可以装满一千辆火车箱。
