　　The Zhoushan Fishing Grounds: Then and Now
　　Che Dingyong
    The Zhoushan Islands are one of China's three major fishing grounds, with a population of 30,000 fishermen. In the past, fishermen suffered from the Kuomintang reactionaries' plunder and the feudal exploitation of the fish market guilds. They ate sweet potato threads, wore tattered padded jackets, and lived a life where "fishermen's children are poor for generations." For this reason, the Zhoushan fishing industry declined.

            Government Issues Loans, Fishermen Repair Boats and Nets
    When Zhoushan was liberated last May, the vast majority of fishermen's boats were leaky, their nets were torn, and they lacked funds to go out to sea to fish. The People's Government, on the one hand, returned the fishing boats seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to the fishermen, and on the other hand, distributed relief grain and issued fishing loans to help the fishermen solve their difficulties. At the same time, the People's Government also encouraged private merchants to invest and organized fishermen to borrow freely. The livelihood difficulties of more than 10,000 unemployed fishermen began to be resolved, and more than 1,000 fishing boats were repaired. In 1950, the Zhoushan Islands' fish production reached about 400,000 dan.
    In order to protect the interests of the fishermen, the government also organized local product companies, the China Grain Company, the China Department Store Company, and the state-owned Hengchang Commercial Company to purchase fish products; and supplied tung oil, hemp, nets, oak bark, alum, and other fishing necessities at reasonable prices, so that the price of fish products and commodities maintained a reasonable ratio, eliminating the phenomenon of private merchants suppressing fish prices and raising commodity prices in the past.
    At present, the Zhoushan branch of the state-owned Zhejiang Aquatic Product Transportation Company has used loans to support the fishing industry and has established purchasing groups to purchase fish products. The China Native Produce Company, the state-owned Hengchang Commercial Company, the Ningbo Special District Cooperative, and other organizations have also established purchasing groups in Dongshajiao and Shenjiamen to carry out purchases. The Aquatic Product Transportation Company and the Hengchang Commercial Company have jointly formed 115 ice-fresh ships since April, and organized transportation and sales in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other places. Therefore, two-thirds of this year's large yellow croaker production can be processed and sold, and one-third can be transported and sold fresh in a timely manner, so that fishermen will not suffer losses. The fishermen unanimously reflected: "The People's Government is really thinking of us."
    With the strong support of the government, the Zhoushan fishing industry is developing from recovery. At present, there are more than 500 pairs of large fishing boats in the Zhoushan Islands. There are no fewer than a thousand other smaller fishing boats that have been put into production.

            Annihilate the Sea Bandits, Suppress the Counter-revolutionaries
    The Fisheries Brigade of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenjiamen, in response to the fishermen's requests, accepted the fishermen's requests in the first four months of this year, braved the stormy seas, and launched a large-scale campaign to wipe out the Chiang bandits' "East China Sea Force of the Ministry of National Defense," killing 23 bandits, including the bandit brigade deputy Xie Jincai, and capturing 37 bandits, including the bandit brigade commander Liu Shugen, seizing a large number of guns and ammunition; and returning five large fishing boats and one drift net boat that had been looted by the sea bandits to the fishermen. On the 21st of last month, Shenjiamen also held a large meeting of more than 3,000 fishermen, publicly tried the sea bandit leader Dong Jiuqing and 17 others who robbed fishing boats, killed fishermen, and sabotaged production, and executed them, so that the sea bandits dared not commit crimes again. Illegal elements on land who colluded with bandit gangs and spread rumors to sabotage the situation no longer dared to act. Order on land and sea became increasingly stable, and the fishermen's production enthusiasm increased. Before May 26th, the total number of large yellow croakers caught in the second tide exceeded 60,000 dan. Fishermen from Fenghua and Xiangshan caught more than 20,000 jin per boat, worth about 100 shi of rice. The fishermen were all smiles and spread the good news, saying, "This is truly the happiness that Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army have brought us."

            Feudal Exploitation Swept Away
    Before liberation, fishermen, like peasants, suffered from feudal exploitation and oppression. The fish market guilds relied on a scale and an abacus to "release fishing gear," lending money at usurious rates, obtaining exclusive purchasing rights, and enjoying "fishing profits." When they collected fish from the fishermen, they used methods such as "small door scales" (the scale knob was very stiff, making it easy to press the scale), "eighty-eight deductions" (100 jin was counted as 88 jin), and "begging for fish soup" (at least 20 to 30 jin each time) to exploit the fishermen. It was considered heavenly justice if 100 jin of fish were weighed as 80 jin; after the "eighty-eight deduction," only 70 jin remained. The fishermen said, "How much effort and risk does it take to catch 10,000 jin of fish? After weighing, 7,000 jin remain; after suppressing the price, it becomes 4,000 or 5,000 jin; after delaying the payment, only 2,000 or 3,000 jin remain; if you eat a bad debt, you can only swallow your tears."
    The Zhoushan branch of the state-owned Zhejiang Aquatic Product Transportation and Sales Company, in response to the urgent needs of the vast fishermen, began to transport and sell Zhoushan fish products and process them in early April this year. The state-owned Zhoushan Fish Market was also established, which swept away all unreasonable feudal exploitation systems in the Zhoushan fishing industry, and the phenomenon of "too much fish and crazy cheap prices" disappeared. This time, of the 60,000 dan of large yellow croakers caught in the second tide, 35,000 dan were processed by private merchants, and the rest were all processed by the Aquatic Product Company. Not only did no yellow croakers rot, but the fish prices were balanced and the supply and demand were adjusted. Jiang Xinmen, director of the Fishermen's Association, said: "The peasants turned over with land reform, and today the government has established the Aquatic Product Company and the Fish Market, and the fishermen have also turned over!"
    Feudal exploitation has been abolished, exorbitant taxes have disappeared, prices have stabilized, and fish prices have gradually become reasonable. In the past, fishermen ate sweet potato threads and rotten-eyed fish; now they eat three meals of white rice a day. The entrance of the China Grain Company in Shenjiamen is crowded with fishermen buying rice every day. After the fishermen's representatives Shen Maotou and Fan Jinfu returned from a meeting in Beijing last winter, the fishermen spread the word: "Who used to look up to 'Ah Mao' who caught fish? Now he has also gone to Beijing to attend a meeting and see Chairman Mao!" The fishermen realized that the People's Government is truly their own government and that the People's Liberation Army is their own army. They called a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that had rendered meritorious service in escorting and suppressing bandits "the protector of the fishermen." Under the leadership of the Dinghai County Federation of Trade Unions, the fishermen of the Zhoushan Islands have begun to organize. Fishermen in seven villages in Shenjiamen have established three fishing trade unions, and more than half of the 1,051 fishermen have joined. They have also organized more than 160 armed personnel to escort themselves.

　　舟山渔场今昔
　　车丁勇
    舟山群岛是我国三大渔场之一，有渔民三万人。在过去，渔民受尽了国民党反动派的掠夺和鱼行栈的封建剥削。他们吃的是蕃薯丝，穿的是破袄，过着“捕鱼人儿世世穷”的日子。舟山渔业就因为这个缘故而衰落不振。
            政府发放贷款，渔民修船捕网
    去年五月舟山刚解放时，广大渔民船漏网破，缺少资金，不能出洋捕鱼。人民政府一面把蒋匪军扣留的渔船归还渔民，一面发救济粮，放渔业贷款，帮助渔民解决困难。同时人民政府又鼓励私商投资，组织渔民自由借贷。一万余失业渔民的生活困难开始解决了，修好了一千多只渔船。一九五○年舟山群岛渔产达到四十万担左右。
    为保障渔民利益，政府又组织土产公司、中国粮食公司、中国百货公司及国营衡昌商业公司收购渔产；并平价供应桐油、麻、网、栲、明矾等渔业必需品，使鱼产品价格与物价保持合理的比例，消除了过去私商压低鱼价，抬高物价的现象。
    目前，国营浙江水产运输公司舟山分公司已运用贷款，扶植渔业加工事业，并设立收购组收购渔产。中国土产公司、国营衡昌商业公司、宁波专区合作总社等，也在东沙角和沈家门两地设立收购组进行收购。水产运输公司和衡昌商业公司从四月份起，合组一百一十五只冰鲜船，分别去上海、杭州、绍兴、宁波等地组织运销。所以今年大黄鱼生产的三分之二能加工销出，三分之一能及时新鲜运销，使渔民不致遭到损失。渔民一致反映：“人民政府真是为我们打算。”
    在政府大力扶持下，舟山渔业正在由恢复走向发展，现在舟山各岛大对渔船已有五百多对。其他较小的渔船，投入生产的也不下千把只。
            剿灭海匪，镇压反革命
    驻沈家门的解放军某部渔业大队，在今年一、二、三、四四个月中，接受渔民要求，不避惊风骇浪，大举出海清剿蒋匪“国防部东海部队”，击毙匪大队附谢金才等二十三名，活捉匪大队长刘树根等三十七名，缴获了大批的枪枝弹药；并把海匪掠夺去的大对渔船五艘和溜网船一艘归还了渔民。上月二十一日，沈家门又召开了三千余渔民的大会，公审抢劫渔船、杀害渔民、破坏生产的海上匪首董久清等十七人，将其处决，使海匪不敢再犯。陆上的勾结匪帮、造谣破坏的不法分子从此也不敢活动了。海陆秩序日趋安定，渔民生产情绪更加提高。五月二十六日以前的二汛大黄鱼，捕获总数在六万担以上。奉化、象山各帮渔民，每船要捕到二万余斤，值大米一百石左右。渔民个个喜笑颜开，纷纷报传喜讯，并说：“这真是毛主席、解放军给我们带来的幸福。”
            封建剥削一扫光
    解放以前，渔民跟农民一样饱受封建剥削和压迫。渔行凭着一杆秤和一架算盘“放行头”，放高利贷，取得专买权，坐享“渔利”。他们向渔民收鱼时用“小门子秤”（秤钮很死，便于压秤）、“八八扣”（一百斤作八十八斤）、“讨鱼羹”（每次至少二、三十斤）等方式剥削渔民。一百斤鱼被秤作八十斤就是天公地道，经过“八八扣”就只剩七十斤了。渔民说：“捕万斤鱼要出多少力，冒多少险，过过秤剩了七千，压压价变了四、五千，拖拖期只剩两、三千；吃个倒账，眼泪只能往肚里咽。”
    国营浙江水产运销公司舟山分公司适应广大渔民的迫切需要，于今年四月初开始对舟山渔产进行运销和加工，国营舟山渔市场也接着成立，这使舟山渔业中一切不合理的封建剥削制度一扫而光，“鱼多狂贱”现象也没有了。这次二汛大黄鱼六万担，除私商加工三万五千担外，其余全为水产公司加工。不但没使黄鱼烂一条，而且平衡了鱼价，调剂了供求。渔民协会主任江新门说：“农民土地改革翻了身，今朝政府办了水产公司和渔市场，捕鱼人也翻身了！”
    封建剥削废除了，苛捐杂税没有了，物价稳定了，鱼价逐渐合理了。过去渔民吃的是蕃薯丝、烂眼鱼，如今一天吃上三顿白米饭。沈家门中国粮食公司门口，天天挨满了渔民在买米。去年冬天渔民代表沈毛头、范金甫从北京开会回来后，渔民们传开了：“从前捉鱼‘阿毛’啥人看得起呢？现在也上北京开会见毛主席啦！”渔民们认识到人民政府真正是自己的政府，解放军是自己的军队，他们把护航清剿土匪有功的解放军某部称为“渔民的保卫者”。在定海县工会的领导下，舟山群岛的渔民已开始组织起来。沈家门七个村的渔民已成立了三个渔业工会，一千零五十一个渔民中已有一半以上参加。他们还组织了一百六十名以上的武装，自己护航。
