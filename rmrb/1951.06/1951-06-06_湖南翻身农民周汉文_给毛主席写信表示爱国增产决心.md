Hunan Peasant Zhou Hanwen, After Emancipation,
Writes to Chairman Mao Expressing Patriotic Determination to Increase Production

Respected Chairman Mao:
　　I used to be a poor peasant most severely oppressed and exploited. Now I have been elected as the chairman of the township government and also selected as a model worker, first class, for the whole county. Speaking of my past life, it was extremely bitter. In 1940, the puppet Bao chief Zhou Changyun wanted to arrest me to be a soldier. I ran away, and they tied up my father. It cost my mother a lot of trouble to borrow money, beg for mercy, and treat the gentry to dinner. In total, it cost forty silver dollars, and she sold two hundred yuan of "legal tender" from seven catties of old-fashioned fine yarn to the Bao chief before my father was released. But in less than two months, the Bao chief wanted to extort money and arrested my father again. In that year alone, my father was arrested four times, causing turmoil in my family. Later, we had no choice but to hide in the deep mountains. It was not until after liberation that we moved back to the village. I joined the peasant association and, under the leadership of the Party and the government, actively carried out anti-feudal struggles such as rent reduction, anti-despotism, and land reform. Everyone saw that I was enthusiastic about serving the masses, so they elected me as the director of the township production committee, and later elected me as the chairman of the township government. I not only led the peasants to resolutely fight against the landlord class, but also led the masses to actively develop production. In just over a year, our township built a total of 319 ponds and planted more than 100,000 trees. This April, the masses elected me as a model worker, first class, for the whole county.

Respected Chairman Mao, I know that this honor is all brought to me by the Communist Party and New China. In order to defend our beloved motherland, my two younger brothers have gloriously joined the People's Liberation Army, and my youngest brother, Jingwen, has also joined the Communist Youth League in the village. My mother feels very happy because she has such sons. Now, our whole family has decided to do the following three things:
    (1) Study current affairs, understand the truth of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country, and propagate it to the masses; (2) Work hard in production, ensure the completion of the family production plan (increasing production by 14 percent), enrich national defense, support the front lines, and defend the fruits of victory; (3) In addition to doing a good job in the township government, I personally must also help the family do a good job in production, strive to become a special-class model worker, and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

　　湖南翻身农民周汉文
    给毛主席写信表示爱国增产决心敬爱的毛主席：
    我过去是一个被压迫被剥削最利害的贫苦农民，现在当选为乡政府的主席，又被选为全县甲等劳动模范。讲起我过去的生活是苦极了。一九四○年，伪保长周长云要抓我去当兵，我跑了，他们便把我父亲捆去。害得我母亲东筹西借、求情说好、请仕绅吃饭，一共用了四十元光洋，还把七斤老秤细纱变卖了两百元“法币”送给保长，才把我父亲放回。但不到两个月，保长要敲诈钱，又把我父亲抓去。就在这一年，我父亲被抓四次，害得我家鸡犬不宁，后来我们只好躲到深山里去住。直到解放以后，我们才搬回村里。我参加了农会，在党和政府领导下，积极进行减租、反恶霸和土地改革等反封建斗争。大家看我热心给群众办事，就选我当本乡生产委员会主任，后又选我作乡政府主席。我不仅带领农民坚决向地主阶级进行斗争，也领导群众积极发展生产，一年多功夫，我们乡共修了三百一十九口水塘，栽了十万多株树木。今年四月，群众又选我为全县甲等劳动模范。
    敬爱的毛主席，我知道这种光荣都是共产党和新中国带给我的。为了保卫我们可爱的祖国，我的两个弟弟已光荣地参加了人民解放军，我的小弟弟敬文在村里也参加了青年团。我母亲因为自己有这样几个儿子，感到满心高兴。现在，我们全家决定要做好以下三件事：
    （一）学习时事，了解抗美援朝保家卫国的道理，向群众进行宣传；（二）努力生产，保证家庭生产计划（增产百分之十四）的完成，充实国防，支援前线，保卫胜利果实；（三）我个人除办好乡政府的工作外，还要帮助家庭搞好生产，争取做特等劳动模范，到北京看毛主席。
