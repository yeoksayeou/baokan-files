　　People in Various Parts of Northeast China
    Rise Up to Expose Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    After the execution of a group of counter-revolutionary elements stained with blood debts in various parts of Northeast China, the people's hearts were greatly pleased, and the masses launched a movement to expose counter-revolutionary elements.
    Public security organs in various places have received thousands of letters of denunciation. The informants solemnly signed and sealed the letters, and stated their addresses, indicating that they were responsible for the cases they reported. According to statistics from four cities in Liaoxi Province and Changchun City in Jilin Province, more than 300 people personally reported counter-revolutionary elements to the public security organs. Many farmers in the suburbs of Changchun went to the public security departments several times to report the situation, and some even traveled dozens of miles to provide materials on counter-revolutionary elements. During the denunciation movement, many cases of denouncing counter-revolutionary relatives occurred. According to statistics from nine city public security organs, there were thousands of such denunciation letters. Gao Huiming, a female worker at a factory in Jinzhou City, Liaoxi Province, reported her husband, Liu Guangzhi, the head of the reactionary secret society "Sanji Tan," and personally led public security personnel to arrest Liu. Liu Qingzhi, who runs a copper and iron shop in Xigang District, Dalian City, reported his cousin Liu Ruizhi, a counter-revolutionary element who had fled from Shandong to his home to escape punishment. Li Zhipeng, a female student at a school in Qiqihar City, reported her counter-revolutionary father, Li Tiebing, who had just fled from Zhengzhou, Henan. The people's active assistance to the government in exposing counter-revolutionary elements has left counter-revolutionary elements with nowhere to hide, creating a situation where "rats running across the street are chased and beaten by everyone." Under the shock of the people's power, many counter-revolutionary elements confessed their crimes one after another, bowed their heads to the people to admit their guilt, and handed over hidden radios, guns, and reactionary documents. According to statistics from only five cities, more than 800 counter-revolutionary elements confessed their crimes. In order to block all gaps for counter-revolutionary elements to carry out activities, factories, organs, schools, shops, and the broad masses of residents in various places have successively formulated plans to prevent spies and special agents, and covenants to protect factories and schools. The maritime defense plan formulated by the fishermen of Dalongtang Village in Lushun Sixth District stipulates: strengthen coastal sentry posts, establish a registration system for the entry and exit of fishing boats, and never allow special agent elements to take advantage of loopholes.
    The hidden counter-revolutionary elements exposed by the people in various places have been carefully and thoroughly investigated and verified by the local people's public security organs, and have been successively arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries.

　　东北各地人民        
    群起检举反革命分子
    东北各地枪决一批血债累累的反革命分子后，人心大快，人民群众展开了检举反革命分子的运动。
    各地人民公安机关都收到成千封检举信件。检举人在信上郑重地签名盖章，并写明自己的住处，表示对所检举的案件负责。据辽西省四个市和吉林省长春市的统计，曾有三百多人亲自到公安机关告发反革命分子。长春市郊许多农民曾三番四次到公安部门反映情况，有的竟从数十里外赶来提供反革命分子的材料。在检举运动中，出现许多检举反革命亲属的事例。据九个城市公安机关统计，这类检举函件达数千封。辽西省锦州市某工厂女工高慧明，检举了她的丈夫反动会道门“三极坛”头子刘广志，并亲自带领公安人员将刘犯逮捕。旅大市西岗区开铜铁铺的刘庆之，检举了由山东畏罪潜逃来他家的堂兄反革命分子刘瑞之。齐齐哈尔市某校女学生李志鹏，检举了刚由河南郑州逃来的反革命父亲李铁冰。人民群众积极协助政府检举反革命分子，已使反革命分子无处藏身，形成一种“老鼠过街人人喊打”的局面。许多反革命分子在人民威力的震慑下，纷纷坦白自首，向人民低头认罪，交出暗藏的电台、枪支及反动证件。仅据五个城市统计，坦白自首的反革命分子即有八百余人，为堵塞反革命分子活动的一切空隙，各地工厂、机关、学校、商店和广大的居民群众，纷纷订立了防奸细防特务计划和护厂护校公约。旅顺第六区大龙塘村渔民订立的海防计划中规定：加强海岸岗哨，建立渔船出入口登记制度，绝不让特务分子有空可钻。
    各地人民群众检举出来的暗藏的反革命分子，经当地人民公安机关慎重周密调查证实后，已根据惩治反革命条例陆续逮捕归案。
