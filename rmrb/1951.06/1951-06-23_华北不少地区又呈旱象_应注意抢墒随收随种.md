Many Areas in North China Show Signs of Drought Again
Attention Should Be Paid to Seizing Moisture for Planting as Harvesting Proceeds

At present, it is the most intense season for agricultural activities. In the North China region, summer harvesting, summer planting, summer hoeing, seedling protection, and pest control are all happening simultaneously. In some areas, there is also heavy spring work, further exacerbating the situation of limited time and numerous tasks. To ensure the successful completion of summer production, the leaders of the provinces in North China have all issued instructions in advance, specifically arranging plans for summer harvesting, summer hoeing, and summer planting, and emphasizing the slogan of seizing moisture for planting, "harvest one mu, plant one mu, plant as you harvest," and "don't let threshing delay summer planting," to promote the development of the summer production movement. As of June 13th, summer harvesting in Pingyuan Province has largely concluded. In southern Hebei's Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Hengshui prefectures, dryland crops have mostly been harvested, and Dingxian and Baoding prefectures have also begun harvesting. In Shanxi, Yuncheng and Linfen prefectures have mostly completed harvesting, and the entire province is expected to finish summer harvesting by the end of June. Currently, cotton fields in Pingyuan have been hoed once across the board. As of June 3rd, Daming, Weixian, Linzhang, Guantao, and Qiuxian counties in Hebei's Handan and other prefectures, as well as Wuqing and Anci counties in Tianjin prefecture, have hoed cotton and sorghum once or twice across the board. In the mountainous areas of Chahar Province, 60% has been hoed. In the plains, Heze prefecture and parts of Puyang prefecture have completed more than 70% of summer planting, while Liaocheng, Chiping, and Guanxian have planted 10% to 15%, and Xiuwu, Bo'ai, and Qinyang have also begun planting. The current problem is: many areas are again showing signs of drought, and leading cadres and the masses are neglecting to seize moisture for planting, failing to seriously organize "planting as you harvest," and much land cannot be planted. The entire province of Pingyuan is generally dry, with about 50% of the late fields not yet planted, and some of those already planted are unable to sprout. Although the masses know that early planting leads to more harvest, they still adhere to the old habits of "caring only about the seeds and not the seedlings" and "planting only after threshing"; and they believe that the season is not late, harboring the idea of "relying on the heavens for rain." This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. The wheat field area in the entire region is very large, reaching more than 69% of the total cultivated land in Pingyuan and nearly 25% in Hebei. Moreover, the wheat seedlings did not develop well this year, and the potential of the land was not fully utilized. Striving for early planting on the wheat stubble is an important link in ensuring a bumper harvest this year. If we do not seize the opportunity to "plant as we harvest" while there is moisture, it will increase the difficulty of drought-resistant planting, which should be given high priority by leaders at all levels. All localities should continue to leverage the experience of drought-resistant planting this spring, carefully assess soil moisture conditions, and "plant as they harvest" where there is moisture; in areas with little or no moisture, they should use borrowing or watering methods for drilling and spot planting; methods such as planting with water-applying drills and seedling cultivation and transplantation can also be tried and promoted, so as to strive to complete the summer planting tasks as soon as possible.

### 华北不少地区又呈旱象  应注意抢墒随收随种

　　华北不少地区又呈旱象
    应注意抢墒随收随种
    目前正是农事活动最紧张的季节。在华北区，夏收、夏种、夏锄与保苗、除虫等任务赶在一起；有的地区又有繁重的春工，更加形成时间紧任务多的情况。华北各省领导上为了作好夏季生产工作，都在事前发布指示，具体安排了夏收、夏锄、夏种的计划，并强调提出了乘墒下种，“收一亩，种一亩，随收随种”，“打场夏种两不误”的口号，推进了夏季生产运动的开展。截至六月十三止，平原省夏收，已大体结束。河北南部邯郸、邢台、石家庄、衡水四个专区旱地已大部收完，定县、保定专区也开始收割。山西之运城、临汾两专区已大部收完，六月底全省可结束夏收。现平原棉田已普锄一遍。截至六月三日，河北邯郸等专区的大名、魏县、临漳、馆陶、邱县，天津专区的武清、安次等县已将棉花高粱普锄一遍或两遍。察哈尔省山沟区已锄完百分之六十。平原菏泽专区及濮阳专区的一部分县，已完成夏种百分之七十以上，聊城、茌平、冠县已种完百分之十至十五，修武、博爱、沁阳亦开始播种。目前的问题是：不少地区又呈旱象，领导干部及群众又忽视抢墒抢种，未认真组织“随收随种”，已有很多土地不能下种。平原全省普旱，约有百分之五十晚田未下种，已种上的有的也不能出苗。群众虽知早种多收，但仍保守着“见籽不顾苗”，“打完场再种”的旧习惯；并认为季节不晚，存在“靠天等雨”的思想。这是当前急需解决的问题。全区麦田面积很大，平原达全部耕地百分之六十九强，河北亦占耕地百分之二十五弱，且今年麦苗发育不好，地利未尽，争取麦茬及早下种，是保证今年丰产的重要一环。如不抓紧趁墒“随收随种”，更将增大抗旱播种的困难，应引起各地领导上的高度重视。各地应继续发挥今春抗旱播种经验，认真掌握墒土情况，有墒的乘墒“随收随种”；墒小或无墒地区，要用借垧或浇水办法进行耩种点种；用水耧耩种和育苗栽种的方法，亦可试用推广。以争取早日完成夏种任务。
