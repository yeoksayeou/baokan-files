Shanghai Railway Administration Qishuyan Railway Factory: Leading cadres lack the thought of relying on the working class, which has severely affected the rationalization proposal movement. This year, workers' suggestions have gradually decreased. When workers put forward rationalization proposals, the leading cadres either believe that "the proposal is too small and has no value" or that "the proposal is too big and difficult to implement." In March of this year, when the passenger car workshop was replacing 1129 spring heads, originally all the interior and exterior wall panels had to be dismantled, and the dismantled wood could no longer be used. The workers suggested dismantling only the interior walls and not the exterior walls, which could save 330 square feet of tongue-and-groove boards. However, the leadership said: "This should have been done anyway. If this is called a rationalization proposal, the workshop leaders should have their salaries deducted." The workers reflected: "We make suggestions, but it leads to the leadership deducting salaries. We won't bother making any more suggestions." Workers in the foundry repeatedly suggested at workers' representative meetings that the mold-baking furnace be converted to burn waste wood scraps, which could save coal. The leading cadres only emphasized "the project is large and difficult to implement" without consulting with the workers on how to overcome the difficulties. When the workers' opinions were not complete enough, the leading cadres rarely provided specific assistance. The leading cadres also did not regularly check the production situation and technical equipment, discover problems, and propose "topics" for the workers to study and solve. When the workers' suggestions led to improvements in the work, the leading cadres did not promptly give praise or rewards. The factory also has a rationalization proposal committee, but they take a perfunctory, procrastinating, and irresponsible attitude towards the workers' suggestions. Some suggestions are even held up for ten months without a reply. The leading cadres at all levels of the factory must quickly change this situation and lead the workers to carry out the rationalization proposal movement in a planned and organized manner.

    领导干部不注意依靠工人  合理化建议受到严重影响
    上海铁路管理局戚墅堰铁路工厂各级领导干部缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想，使合理化建议运动受到严重影响，今年工人的建议逐渐减少。当工友们提出合理化建议时，领导干部不是认为“建议太小，没什么价值”，就是认为“建议太大，实行起来有困难”。客车工场今年三月做一一二九换椿头时，原来要把内外墙板全部拆光，拆下来的木料就不能再用。工人建议只拆里墙不拆外墙，这样可以节省三百三十平方英尺的企口缝板。但是领导上却说：“本来就应该这样做的。如果这也叫合理化建议，工场领导人倒该扣薪水了。”工人们反映：“咱们提建议，倒叫领导上扣薪水，以后咱们就不用提了。”翻砂工厂工人多次在工人代表会上建议将烘模炉改装为烧废木屑，可以省煤。领导干部只强调“工程大实行不易”，而不和工友们商量克服困难的办法。工人们提的意见有时不够完整，领导干部也很少给予具体帮助。领导干部更没有随时检查生产情况和技术设备，发现问题，提出“课题”请工友们钻研解决。工友们的建议使工作得以改进，领导干部也没有及时给予表扬奖励。厂里也有合理化建议委员会，但是他们对工友们的建议采取敷衍拖拉不负责任的态度。有的建议甚至被积压十个月不予答复。该厂各级领导干部必须迅速地改变这种情况，有计划有组织地领导工人开展合理化建议运动。
