How Shenyang City Basically Eliminated the Phenomenon of Primary School Graduates Dropping Out of School?
　　Wang Wu, Chen Ming

    In the past two and a half years, primary and secondary education in Shenyang City has developed rapidly.
    The number of primary schools has increased from 100 in the early days of liberation to 769, and the number of students has increased from 51,977 to 226,445. The development in the suburban areas of the city has been even faster, with the number of schools increasing from 41 to 649, and the number of students increasing from 10,500 to 99,016. At present, the enrollment rate of school-age children in the suburbs has reached 79.7 percent, and 72 percent in the city.
    The number of secondary schools has increased from 23 in the early days of liberation to 26 (with 10 additional branch schools); the number of students has increased from 14,022 to 23,118. However, the number of secondary schools is still insufficient. In the past two years, a total of 5,000 to 6,000 higher primary school graduates each year have not been able to enter secondary school. This year, two secondary schools and ten secondary school branch schools were opened in rural areas, and a two-part system was established in ten secondary schools and normal schools in the city, allowing 9,050 higher primary school graduates (accounting for 91.6 percent of all higher primary school graduates) to enter secondary schools, basically eliminating the phenomenon of higher primary school graduates dropping out of school.
    What measures have we taken to enable primary school students to have the opportunity to attend and continue their education?
    First, we maximized the effectiveness of existing school buildings. Primary schools in the city, from the first year to the fourth year of primary school, all implemented a two-part system, and established literacy classes for children in the first and second grades of primary school, with excellent students from the first and second grades of higher primary school serving as "little teachers" (with teachers as counselors). In this way, a school could accommodate almost two schools' worth of students. The first part of the students attended classes in the morning, and the second part and the literacy classes attended in the afternoon. Taking the Ten Weilu Complete Primary School as an example, there were a total of 4,627 students, including 2,479 in the first part, 1,555 in the second part, and 593 in the literacy classes. Therefore, although the number of classrooms in the city now (1,518) has only increased by 77 percent compared to the early days of liberation (859), the number of students accommodated has increased by more than threefold. Both parts of the two-part system have full-time teachers, and everything for the students in the second part is the same as for the students in the first part.
    From this year, junior high schools and normal schools have also been piloting the two-part system (also known as night middle schools). Junior high schools enrolled 1,666 new students, and normal schools enrolled 833 new students, equivalent to the new students that six newly established middle schools and three normal schools could accommodate. The students in the second part attended classes from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily and on Sundays. The curriculum, teaching hours, and teaching plans were all the same as for the students in the first part. Most of the teachers were part-time teachers from the first part, but specific systems were established to prevent them from affecting the teaching of either the first or second part. The two-part system normal school changed the "old rule" that normal school students must live on campus and allowed all students to live at home. The school distributed public funds to the students.
    Secondly, we mobilized the masses to run schools. In the past, certain work had been done in supporting and rewarding private schools, and encouraging government agencies, factories, and enterprises to establish elementary schools for their employees' children and to enroll students who were not the children of their employees; however, we did not have enough understanding of the work of extensively mobilizing the masses to run schools themselves, and therefore failed to vigorously promote it. This year, based on past experience and the decision of the Northeast People's Government, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Mobilizing All Municipal Agencies, Enterprises, Factories, and Street Communities to Run Elementary Schools." It is estimated that there are currently about 70,000 school-age children in the city who are not in school, and another 50,000 school-age children will be seeking enrollment next year. Therefore, if we want to basically eliminate the phenomenon of school-age children not being in school within one or two years, we must mobilize the people of the whole city to run schools on a larger scale.
    Third, we opened the door for children of workers and peasants to enter secondary schools. The problem of children of workers and peasants entering primary school has been basically solved with the development of factory children's primary schools, rural primary schools, and general primary schools. However, it is more difficult for children of workers and peasants to enter secondary school than to enter primary school. The reasons are: first, because they were deprived of the necessary learning conditions under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, some of them have a lower level of education; second, they have economic difficulties; and third, it is inconvenient for rural students to attend school in the area. We started from various aspects to overcome and reduce these difficulties: first, 80 percent of the people's scholarship funds were distributed to the children of workers and peasants. Second, last year, worker and peasant children who graduated after passing the unified examination for higher primary school graduates in the city were allowed to enter junior high school and junior normal school without taking an entrance examination. Although the conditions for exemption from the entrance examination this year have been raised to require a graduation score of 70 or higher, two new junior high schools and ten junior high school branch schools have been established in the suburbs of the city, and a two-part system has been established in the city. During the examination and admission process, the admission standards for children of workers and peasants were lowered by five points compared to general students, so that almost all the children of workers and peasants who wanted to enter junior high school and normal school had the opportunity to enroll. At present, the proportion of children of workers and peasants in the first-year students of junior high school and junior normal school in the city has reached 61.6 percent. There are already 12,194 children of workers and peasants in secondary schools throughout the city, accounting for 53.5 percent of all students (students in worker-peasant rapid training schools are not included).
    The main difficulty in the development of primary and secondary education is the shortage of teachers. At present, the number of teachers that primary schools need to increase each year is 1,000 to 1,500, while there are only 300 to 500 normal school graduates. Although it is possible to recruit some unemployed intellectuals from society to supplement the shortage, or increase the number of normal school students, it still cannot meet the needs of primary schools. At present, the measures we have taken to solve the difficulty of the shortage of teachers in middle schools and normal schools are mainly: to select teachers with high levels from junior high schools to teach in senior high schools, and to select teachers with high levels from primary schools to teach in junior high schools; to select people with higher levels from senior high school and intermediate normal school graduates and in-service primary school teachers to establish special training classes for middle school teachers to improve their levels; and to hire unemployed intellectuals to teach or enter special training classes through various means.
    Our experience is that only when the education department resolutely implements the instructions of the higher authorities and takes specific and effective measures to develop schools can the difficulties in the development of school education be overcome; the phenomenon of school-age children and higher primary school graduates not being in school can be basically eliminated in a short period of time. Only by relying on the broad masses of the people, and with the cooperation and assistance of various government agencies, enterprises, and factories, is it possible to eliminate the phenomenon of school-age children and higher primary school graduates not being in school in a short period of time.

　　沈阳市怎样基本消灭了小学毕业生失学的现象？
　　王无、陈明
    两年半以来，沈阳市中、小学教育，有了迅速的发展。
    小学校校数由解放初期的一○○所，增加到七六九所，学生数由五一、九七七人增加到二二六、四四五人。市郊区发展速度更快，校数由四一所增加到六四九所，学生数由一○、五○○人增加到九九、○一六人。现郊区就学儿童，已达学龄儿童的百分之七十九点七，市内亦达百分之七十二。
    中等学校校数由解放初期的二三所，增加到二六所（另增十所分校）；学生数由一四、○二二人增加到二三、一一八人。但中等学校还是不敷需要，过去两年中，每年高小毕业生总有五、六千人升不了中学。今年，在农村开辟了两所中学、十所中学分校，在市内的十所中学及师范学校内设立了二部制，使九、○五○名高小毕业生（占全部高小毕业生的百分之九一·六）升入了中等学校，基本上消灭了高小毕业生失学的现象。
    我们采取什么办法使小学生获得就学和升学的机会？
    首先是使现有校舍发挥最大的效能。市内小学从初级一年至四年级，一律实行二部制，并设初级一、二年级的儿童识字班，由高小一、二年级的优秀学生担任小先生（有教师作辅导员）。这样，一个学校就差不多收容了两个学校的学生。上午是第一部学生上课，下午是第二部及识字班。以十纬路完全小学为例，共有学生四、六二七人，其中一部生为二、四七九人，二部生为一、五五五人，识字班生为五九三人。因而现在市内的教室数字（一五一八个），虽然只比解放初期（八五九个）增加了百分之七十七，但所收容的学生，则增加了三倍多。二部制都设有专任教员，二部生的一切都和一部生相同。
    初中和师范从今年起，也试行了二部制（又叫夜中学）。初中招了一、六六六名新生，师范招了八三三名新生，等于新建立的六所中学和三所师范所能收容的新生。二部生每日下午三时至七时及星期日上课，课程、授课时数及教学计划等，皆与一部生相同。教师多数由一部教师兼任，但规定了具体制度，不使其影响一部或二部的教学。二部制师范，改变了师范生必须住校的“老例”，一律走读。学校将公费发给学生。
    其次，发动人民群众办学。过去，在扶植和奖励私立学校，以及鼓励机关、工厂设立员工子弟小学并吸收非本单位员工子弟学生入学等方面，都作了一定的工作；但对于广泛地发动人民群众自己兴办学校的工作，认识得不够，因而未能大力推行。今年沈阳市人民政府根据过去的经验及东北人民政府的决定，颁布了“关于发动本市各机关、企业、工厂及街道群众兴办小学的决定”。据估计，目前全市尚有失学的学龄儿童约七万人，明年又将有五万适龄儿童要求入学。因此，如果要求在一、两年内，基本上消灭学龄儿童失学现象，就必须更大规模地动员全市人民群众办学。
    第三、为工农子女打开升入中学的大门。工农子女入小学的问题，已经随着工厂子弟小学、农村小学和一般小学的发展而基本上得到了解决。但工农子女升入中学比入小学困难多一些。其原因：第一、由于过去在国民党反动派统治下，他们被剥夺了应有的学习条件，因而有一部分人的文化程度低一些；第二、经济上有困难；第三、农村学生就学地域不便。我们从各方面着手，克服和减少了这些困难：首先，以人民助学金的百分之八十，分配给工农子弟。第二、对经过全市高小毕业生统一考试准予毕业的工农子弟，去年实行了一律免试升入初级中学及初级师范的办法。今年免试条件，虽提高为毕业成绩须在七十分以上，但又在市郊新设了两所初中和十所初中分校，市内又设了二部制。在考试录取时，对工农子女的录取标准，又较一般学生降低了五分，因而使要求升入初中和师范的工农子女，差不多全部得到了入学的机会。现全市初中、初师一年级新生中，工农子女比例已占了百分之六十一点六。全市中等学校内，已有一二、一九四名工农子女，占全体学生的百分之五十三点五（工农速成中学学生尚未计算在内）。
    发展中、小学教育中，存在的主要困难是教师不足。目前小学每年需要增加的教师数量是一千至一千五百人，而师范毕业生只有三百至五百人。虽然可以在社会上吸收一些失业知识分子来补充，或增加师范生的名额，但还是满足不了小学的需要。目前我们所采取的解决中学和师范学校缺少教师困难的办法，主要是：从初中选拔水平高的教师去教高中，从小学选拔水平高的教师去教初中；从高中及中级师范毕业生中及在职小学教师中选出水平较高的人，成立中学教师专修班，提高他们的水平；通过各种方式聘请失业知识分子任教或进专修班。
    我们的经验是：只有教育部门坚决地执行上级的指示，采取具体的有效的办法发展学校，发展学校教育中的困难是可以克服的；学龄儿童及高小毕业学生失学的现象，是可以在短期内基本上消灭的。只有依靠广大人民群众，在各机关、企业、厂矿的配合和协助下，才有可能在短时期内作到消灭学龄儿童和高小毕业生失学的现象。
