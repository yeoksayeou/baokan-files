    Wuhu County Grain Bureau's Careless Warehouse Construction
        Warehouse Collapse Kills Person Editor Comrade:
    In the autumn of 1950, the Wuhu County Grain Bureau in Southern Anhui Province contracted with private merchants to build three warehouses. The newly built warehouses collapsed successively in March and April of this year, less than a year after construction, resulting in the tragic death of the warehouse director and injuries to workers.
    The first collapse of a newly built warehouse occurred in the county on March 11. After this incident, the Southern Anhui District Grain Bureau instructed the county to carefully inspect the warehouses. On April 24, the warehouse director, Yu Lihang, discovered that the pillars were fractured during an inspection. When Yu Lihang led workers to prop up the warehouse with wood, the warehouse collapsed. Warehouse director Yu Lihang was killed on the spot, and workers were injured.
    The main reason for this incident is that the leading cadres of the county's Grain Bureau were careless and irresponsible towards this important construction work. Before the construction of the warehouses, the county did not design the project well or draw detailed plans, but casually signed a contract with private merchants. During the construction process, the leaders neglected inspection, causing the cadre in charge of warehouse construction, Zuo Guowei (who has now been sent to court), to collude with the contracting private merchants to cut corners and embezzle funds, making the construction project fail to meet the required standards. After completion and acceptance, although it was discovered that the construction was hasty and did not meet the contractual standards, the leading cadres, due to bureaucracy and ideological paralysis, did not seriously investigate. This led to the tragic event of injury to people's lives and property.
    In addition, the warehouse staff in the county only paid attention to the storage of grain in the past, neglecting the maintenance and inspection of the warehouses, and neglecting the methods of grain stacking and turnover, which also had a certain impact on the collapse of the warehouses. For example, the collapse of the Shigang warehouse in the county was due to poor construction quality and bulging warehouse walls on the one hand, and blind emptying of grain in warehouse No. 4, while the adjacent warehouse No. 3 still had grain stored to a height of three or four feet, causing the warehouse to collapse due to unbalanced pressure.
    Currently, under the leadership and assistance of the Southern Anhui District Grain Bureau, the Wuhu County Grain Bureau has reviewed the above events and is determined to learn from past lessons and do a good job in the construction and maintenance of warehouses.

        The Practice of Employing Contractors Must Be Firmly Abolished
        (I) Editor Comrade:
    I am a river-digging worker on the South Moat of Beijing. I have a suggestion that I would like you to publish in the newspaper. There is a contractor on the South Moat. I heard him say to the workers: "Talk less to the construction staff." This aroused my suspicion. The South Moat project has not been done well, and in my opinion, it is because the contractor is causing trouble. The contractor and the work zone leaders are "competing," and the contractor's thinking is like this: "If you don't deduct 10% of my wages, I'll make you fail." Now I hear that the work zone leaders are going to ask the contractor to find workers again. I don't agree with this. I suggest that the work zone leaders no longer use contractors to recruit temporary workers. The contractor always thinks that we can't do without him, but we must show him that we can! I believe we can do better without him!

  (II)
    The logistics department of a certain military region actually contracted an important construction project to a private factory which then subcontracted it to a contractor. During the construction of this project, workers were constantly subjected to illegal exploitation by the private construction factory or the contractor. For example, the contractor Cui Yushan subcontracted a project undertaken by the Rongju Construction Factory, and owed wages to workers Sun Jianghai, Li Mingsheng, and dozens of others, which were not settled even after the project was completely handed over. After Han Zili, the manager of the Xinzhong Construction Factory, contracted a project, more than 30 workers, including Shen Hai, participated in the work. When it came time to settle the accounts, the workers said they had worked 450 days, but Han Zili said they had only worked 150 days. According to Han's accounts, the workers actually owed the Xinzhong Construction Factory 1,200 catties of millet. When the workers could not pay, Han Zili detained the workers' representative, Shen Hai, and did not allow him to eat until Shen Hai found an opportunity to escape, after which he reported the matter to the Labor Bureau. When another group of workers settled accounts with the Xinzhong Construction Factory, they initially calculated that they had completed 176.6 cubic meters of stonework. A few days later, they said they had only completed 120 cubic meters, and later compromised at 156.115 cubic meters. The workers received nothing besides food and owed 367 catties of millet, so they did not even have the money to return home.
    Although these events are already being handled by the relevant labor bureaus or courts, such a chaotic contracting system has already affected the quality of important projects and delayed the completion time. This project also involves state secrets, and it is extremely inappropriate for these unscrupulous private merchants to contract it. Therefore, we feel that this matter deserves attention.

  Certain Brick Kilns in Beijing Should Not Sell Bad Bricks Editor Comrade:
    Recently, I have seen many piles of new bricks for construction on the streets of Beijing, and some of the red bricks are of very poor quality and easily broken. Many are broken during loading and unloading. If these bricks are used for construction, it will affect the quality of our capital's public and private buildings and may even endanger the lives and property of the residents. Therefore, I suggest: (1) Relevant departments should inspect the brick kilns. Each brick kiln should guarantee that no bad bricks are sold. (2) Please pay attention to inspection by all units engaged in construction. If bad bricks are found, they should be returned to the seller. (3) The government should strengthen the management of the brick kiln industry in the future, and should stipulate the standard quality of bricks. Those that do not meet the standards should not be allowed to be sold.             Yimin
        Suggestion to Pay Attention to Flood Prevention Work Editor Comrade:
    Last rainy season, many public and private enterprises in Beijing did not pay enough attention to flood prevention work. Only six state-owned factories under the Beijing Municipal People's Government, namely, the Pharmaceutical Factory, the Pottery Factory, the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Yanjing Paper Mill, and the Match Factory, suffered house collapses, leaking workshops, and damage to materials due to negligence in prevention, causing great losses to people's property.
    Since the beginning of summer this year, some factories have still not paid due attention to flood prevention work. The No. 2 Branch of the Beijing Garment Factory has placed more than 10,000 sets of old cotton clothes and some cotton in the yard, covering only a layer of mat on top when it rains. As a result, a lot of cotton was wet and some was soaked in water. Some losses could have been avoided if attention had been paid to inspection and prevention earlier.
    I have the following suggestions for flood prevention work, for everyone's reference: (1) The leaders of all departments must pay attention to flood prevention work and mobilize the majority of employees to carry out leak prevention, moisture prevention, damp prevention, and mildew prevention; (2) Warehouses, engine rooms, workshops, ditches, and indoor and outdoor wires should be carefully inspected and repaired; (3) Materials stored in the open air should be moved indoors as soon as possible or rainproof equipment should be strengthened; (4) Newly built houses should strictly abide by construction regulations.

  The Manager of Shijiazhuang Department Store
  Should Not Lend Public Funds to Private Individuals Editor Comrade:
    When the head of the accounting department of the Shijiazhuang Department Store purchased land for his family, the company manager actually approved a loan of 1.5 million yuan in public funds to him, and the head of the planning department also borrowed 3 million yuan in public funds in the same way. These public funds were borrowed for several months before being returned to the public. Some comrades in the company expressed their opinions to the manager, but the manager not only did not humbly accept the opinions and correct his mistakes, but instead thought it was to "take care of the emotions of the cadres." I think this way of taking care of cadres is inappropriate. In addition, the company manager's understanding of the Trade Union Law is also insufficient. For example, if a cadre's family has difficulties, the manager actually used administrative power to lend 700,000 yuan of "trade union welfare funds" to the cadre, which is also inappropriate. In addition, the unity between cadres in the company is also very poor. I hope the company manager will review and improve.         A Cadre
  Labor and Management Should Coordinate and Cooperate When Private Stores Formulate Patriotic Pledges Editor Comrade:
    Currently, after receiving patriotic education on resisting the United States and aiding Korea and opposing the American imperialist armed aggression against Japan, the employees of many private stores have raised their political awareness and their patriotic enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. They have successively formulated patriotic pledges. At the same time, many store owners, after being called upon by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, have also formulated patriotic pledges. However, the current shortcoming is that labor and management did not discuss and negotiate together when formulating their respective patriotic pledges. Some pledge items, such as "doing a good job in business" and "ensuring tax revenue," are closely related to both labor and management, but because the two sides lack contact, they have not played a role in mutual cooperation. For example, if the employees' patriotic pledge says they want to ensure tax revenue, they do not know exactly how to do it. If the management does not make the accounts public and the workers cannot figure it out, then "ensuring tax revenue" is empty talk. It is necessary for both parties to be able to negotiate the specific implementation methods of ensuring tax revenue in the patriotic pledge. In order to do a good job in business, it is recommended that labor and management in private stores consult and cooperate with each other when formulating patriotic pledges, and frequently supervise and check each other to ensure the implementation of patriotic pledges. This will not only avoid the signing of patriotic pledges from becoming a formality, but also improve labor-management relations more through the formulation of patriotic pledges.

    芜湖县粮食局草率建筑仓库
        仓库倒塌砸死人编辑同志：
    皖南芜湖县粮食局于一九五○年秋经由私商营造厂建筑仓库三所。新建的仓库还不到一年，竟于今年三月及四月接连发生倒塌并砸死仓库主任及砸伤工人的惨痛事件。
    该县在三月十一日第一次发生新建仓库倒塌事件。此事发生后，皖南区粮食局即指示该县，认真检查仓库。该县仓库主任俞理行，在四月二十四日检查仓库时，发现房柱折裂。当俞理行带领工人用木料去顶仓房时，仓房倒塌。仓库主任俞理行当即被砸死并砸伤了工人。
    此事发生的主要原因，是该县粮食局领导干部对这一重要的修建工作马虎草率，不负责任。该县在施工修建仓库前，对工程未很好设计，未绘制详细图案，即随便与私营厂商签订承包合同。在修建过程中，领导者又疏于检查，致主办修建仓库的干部左国威（现已送法院）与承包私商勾结，偷工减料，大肆贪污，使建筑工程不合规定标准。在竣工后验收时，虽发现建筑草率，不符合合同标准，但由于领导干部官僚主义，思想麻痹，一直未认真追究。以致造成此次损伤人民生命财产的惨痛事件。
    另外，该县仓库工作人员过去只注意保管粮食，而忽视对仓库的保养、检查，忽视粮食的堆装及倒仓方法，对仓库的塌坏也有一定影响。如该县石硊仓库的塌坏，一方面是由于建筑质量不好，仓房墙壁已经外涨；一方面是由于盲目地将四号仓存粮倒空，但紧邻的三号仓存粮仍有一丈三、四尺高，因压力不平衡，致使仓房崩塌。
    现芜湖县粮食局已在皖南区粮食局的领导和帮助下，检讨上述事件，决心接受过去的教训，作好仓库的修建和保养工作。

        应坚决取缔包工头
        （一）编辑同志：
    我是北京市南护城河的挖河工人，我有一点意见，想请你在报上登出来。南护城河有一个包工头，我听他对工人说：对施工员要少说话。这样就引起我的怀疑。南护城河工程没有搞好，照我看就是因为包工头在捣鬼。包工头和工区领导干部“斗宝”，包工头的心思就是这样的：你不叫我扣百分之十的工资，我就叫你垮了。现在我听说工区领导干部又要叫包工头去找工人了，我不同意这样做。我建议工区领导干部不要再用包工头招临时工人。包工头总认为我们离了他就不行，我们必须做给他看看；我认为没有他会做得更好！
    南护城河挖河工人  杜彬
  （二）
    某军区后勤部竟将某项重要建设工程包给私营厂商又转包给包工头来进行。在这项建筑工程施工过程中，工人不断受到私营建筑厂或包工头非法剥削。如包工头崔玉山转包了荣聚建筑工厂承揽的某项工程，拖欠工人孙江海、李明生等数十人的工资，直到完全交工后仍不给清。新中建筑工厂经理韩自立承包某项工程后，工人沈海等三十多人参加工作。到算工账时，工人说他们做了四百五十个工，而韩自立却说他们只做了一百五十个工。照韩的账上算起来，工人反倒欠新中建筑厂小米一千二百斤。工人还不了账，韩自立即将工人的代领人沈海扣押起来，不准吃饭，直到沈海找到机会逃跑以后，他才把此事控告到劳动局。另一部分工人在和新中建筑工厂算账时，起初算了一下，说是完成了石工一百七十六点六方，再过几天，又说只完成了一百二十方，后来又折衷算成一百五十六点一一五方。工人除了吃饭，一文未得，并倒欠了小米三百六十七斤，因此连回家的路费也没有了。
    这些事件，虽然已经由有关的劳动局或法院在处理中，但是这样紊乱的包工制度，已经影响了重要工程的质量，并且还推延了完工时间。这项工程又是有关国家机密的，现在由这些作风不良的私商来承包，也极为不妥。因此，我们觉得这件事情值得引起注意。

  北京某些砖窑业不应出卖坏砖编辑同志：
    近来我在北京街上，见到很多地方垛着准备修建用的新砖，其中有一部分红砖质量很不好，容易破碎，在装卸过程中就碎了好多。如果用这种砖进行修建，将会影响我们首都公私建筑物的质量，甚至可能危害住房人的生命和财产。因此我建议：（一）有关部门应对砖窑进行检查。各砖窑应保证不出卖坏砖。（二）请进行建筑的各单位注意检查，如发现有坏砖，应退还卖主。（三）政府今后应加强对砖窑业的管理，并应规定砖的标准质量，不合格者不准其出卖。             益民
        建议重视雨季防范工作编辑同志：
    去年雨季，北京市不少公私企业部门对雨季防范工作重视不够。仅北京市人民政府下属即有制药厂、窑业厂、华兴染织厂、燕京造纸厂、火柴厂等六个公营工厂，因疏于防范，曾发生塌房、工房漏雨及损坏物资等情形，使人民财产受到很大损失。
    今年入夏以来，某些工厂对雨季的防范工作仍未引起应有的重视。北京被服厂二分厂，将旧棉衣万余套及棉花一部放在院子里，下雨时上边仅盖一层席子。致棉花被淋湿很多，有些还被水泡了。如及早注意检查和防范，有些损失是可以避免的。
    对雨季的防范工作，我有以下几点意见，提供大家参考：（一）各部门的领导上必须重视雨季防范工作，并动员广大职工进行防漏、防潮、防湿、防霉等工作；（二）对仓库、机房、车间、水沟及室内外的电线，应认真进行检查与修缮；（三）露天存放之物资，应尽快移置室内或加强防雨设备；（四）新建房屋，应严格遵守建筑规程。

  石家庄百货公司经理
  不应随便借公款给私人编辑同志：
    石家庄百货公司会计科长家中购地时，公司经理竟批准借他公款一百五十万元，计划科科长亦同样借用公款三百万元。此项公款被借用几个月，才归还公家。公司里有同志向经理提出意见，该经理非但不虚心接受意见改正错误，反而认为是为了“照顾干部情绪”。我认为这样照顾干部的方式是欠妥当的。又该公司经理对工会法认识也不够，如有的干部家中有困难，经理竟以行政权力将“工会福利金”借给该干部七十万元，也是不妥当的。此外该公司干部间团结也很不好，希望该公司经理检讨，改进。         一干部
  私营商店订爱国公约时劳资双方应当协商配合编辑同志：
    目前很多私营商店的职工，经过抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义武装日本的爱国主义教育后，提高了政治觉悟，爱国热情空前高涨，纷纷订立了爱国公约；同时不少商店的资方，经过工商联合会的号召，也订立了爱国公约。但目前的缺点是劳资双方订立各自的爱国公约时没有在一起讨论协商，有些公约项目如“搞好业务”、“保证税收”等，劳资双方都有密切的关系，但是因为双方缺少联系，没有起到互相配合的作用。如职工的爱国公约中说要保证税收，就不知道具体应该怎样做；如果资方账目不公开，工人摸不着底，则“保证税收”就是空话。要双方能互相协商爱国公约中保证税收这一项的具体执行办法才行。为了把业务搞好，建议各私营商店劳资双方在订立爱国公约时能互相协商，互相配合，经常互相督促和检查，以保证爱国公约的执行。这样不但可以避免签订爱国公约流于形式主义，而且通过订爱国公约，可以把劳资关系更加改进。
