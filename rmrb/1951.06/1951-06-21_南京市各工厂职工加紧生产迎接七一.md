Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th -- Workers in various factories in Nanjing are speeding up production to complete their production tasks for this month ahead of schedule as a gift to celebrate the birthday of the Communist Party of China.

The entire workforce of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant of the Jinan Railway Bureau, which has a glorious tradition of the "February 7th" strike, will not only guarantee the completion of the locomotive repair tasks for this month but also overhaul an additional three locomotives. New records are constantly emerging in the stepped-up production. The Sun Shifa team in the locomotive shop created a spring press machine. In the past, it took four people fifteen minutes to compress two springs, but now each person compresses two springs in three minutes. The Sun Lanyou team disassembled a locomotive, saving eighty-eight hours compared to the past. The Chen Baoheng team in the machine shop improved the tool for milling inner eyes, increasing work efficiency sixfold. Due to technical improvements and a conscientious and responsible work attitude, product quality has also improved. For example, in the past, locomotives that were repaired often experienced overheating of the main bearing during test runs, resulting in rework, but this phenomenon has not occurred since June. To complete the task ahead of schedule, all factory workers also launched a mutual assistance campaign. Many teams, after completing their tasks, sent manpower to help other teams work. Office staff also formed an on-site service team, dedicating one hour of their spare time each day to assist production in various shops.

In addition, workers in the casting shop of the Nanjing Machine Factory and some teams of the Radio Factory are also working hard to complete their June production tasks ahead of schedule.

　　南京市各工厂职工加紧生产迎接七一
    【新华社南京二十日电】南京市各工厂职工正加紧生产，以便提前完成本月份生产任务，作为迎接中国共产党生日的献礼。
    有着“二七”光荣斗争传统的济南铁路局浦镇机厂全体工人，除保证完成本月份机车抢修任务外，还要额外大修三台机车。在加紧生产中，新纪录不断出现。机车场孙世发小组，创造了压簧机一部，过去四个人十五分钟压弹簧二个，现在每人三分钟压两个。孙兰友小组解体一辆机车，比过去节省了八十八小时。机械场陈宝恒小组改进铣内眼的工具，使工作效率提高了六倍。由于技术的改进和工作态度的认真负责，产品质量也有改进。例如过去检修的机车，在试车时常常发生大轴发热而返工，六月份以来即未再发生这种现象。为了提前完成任务，全厂职工还展开了互助运动。很多小组在完成任务后，就派出人力帮助另一小组工作。办公室的职员也组成了现场服务队，每天抽出一小时的业余时间协助各场生产。
    此外，南京机器厂的铸工场及有线电厂的部分小组的工人，也正在为提前完成六月份的生产任务而努力。
