　　How Should the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Support the Korean Front?
　　Zhu Jisheng, Deputy Head of the Fifth Sub-Group of the Chinese Delegation to Korea and Representative of the Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Sector
　　This time, I participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea as a representative of the industrial and commercial sectors. After arriving in Korea, what moved me the most and impressed me the deepest was the fighting will, stronger than steel, demonstrated by the people of China and Korea, and the optimistic spirit of using wisdom to overcome difficulties. One cannot deeply understand the extent of the disasters suffered by the Korean people without going to Korea. One cannot thoroughly understand the arduousness of the combat conditions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and logistics personnel without going to Korea. Such disasters and such hardships are rare in world history. However, under such circumstances, they united and fought, striking the enemy with unparalleled bravery, one after another. This made me personally experience the meaning and spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and strengthened my understanding and confidence in the inevitable victory of the war against America.
　　At the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement last year, our industrial and commercial sectors in various parts of the country successively launched surging demonstrations and parades, and at the same time signed patriotic pacts. This was a manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm. But now, our people in the rear must go further and more specifically support the front line with practical actions. We must mobilize to the grassroots organizations of industry and commerce, and mobilize the entire industrial and commercial sectors of the country to strive to support the front line.
　　First of all, we industrialists and businessmen should work and operate actively in our respective posts. We must learn from the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army how to bravely use wisdom and master technology to overcome all difficulties and carry out great tasks in difficult environments. In the Korean countryside, due to the lack of labor force caused by young people joining the army, and 70% to 80% of the cattle being robbed or killed by the American bandits, the brave Korean people responded to General Kim Il-sung's call, mobilized the old, the young, and women, and worked day and night under enemy aircraft attacks, using mutual assistance, labor exchange, and other methods to complete the spring plowing and sowing work in a timely manner. This fact alone is worthy of our industrialists and businessmen to learn deeply. The Korean national industry and commerce were almost completely destroyed by the American aggressors, but after the withdrawal of the American-Li bandits, they worked hard to rebuild from the ruins. So far, many shops and factories have been established in Pyongyang alone, especially factories manufacturing daily necessities, such as rubber shoe factories and aluminum bowl factories, which have been well restored. The environment for Chinese industry and commerce is better. Although there are difficulties, we should learn from the Korean farmers and industrial and commercial sectors and strive hard. We must also learn the spirit of the Volunteer Army: "Find experience in combat, find solutions in development." We should try to manufacture ourselves, or research substitutes for, materials and equipment that used to be imported from abroad; we must also vigorously promote urban-rural exchanges and use joint operations, joint ventures and other methods to communicate the exchange of local products; these are all the unshirkable responsibilities of industrialists and businessmen.
　　Secondly, we must extensively study how to make the military supplies we manufacture as suitable as possible for the situation on the front line. For example:
　　(1) In terms of food, we should solicit the opinions of doctors and nutrition experts, study them carefully, so that the canned food we manufacture is rich in various vitamins, so that the commanders and fighters at the front can obtain nutritious food, and the wounded and sick can recover quickly. The canned food we supply to the front is best to contain more oil, salt and sugar. Our country produces the most beans and eggs, and we should study how to make bean milk powder, dried tofu, etc. from soybeans as much as possible; and make a kind of egg stick with eggs, monosodium glutamate, and potatoes to supply the front. Also, the commanders at the front put forward the opinion to the members of the delegation that each kind of canned food must not only be nutritious, but also be not easily spoiled, and can be eaten for several days after opening. Therefore, canned beef is not as suitable as beef jerky, meat floss, pork liver, beef liver, or salted lard.
　　(2) In terms of medicines, we should study and make various vitamin pills or their substitutes, various wound-healing and disinfectant materials, various anti-epidemic medicines and injections. Now that summer is here, infectious diseases may be prevalent. Moreover, the American aggressors are inhumanely using bacteriological weapons in Korea to poison the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Korean people. We should be prepared on the front line to fight bacteria.
　　(3) Regarding the packaging problem, we must also pay attention to the situation at the front. We produce these things, not only to absolutely guarantee excellent quality, but also to consider the convenience of transportation, loading and unloading, storage and other aspects. For example, the weight of each box should not exceed fifty catties, because in the battlefield handling, it is best for each piece to be carried by one person, which is more convenient. Other points for rainproof, moistureproof, and fireproof should also be paid attention to in the packaging.
　　In this regard, our industrialists and businessmen should carefully study with the workers and staff, and strive to meet the actual needs of the front, and give the soldiers at the front the greatest concern at all times.
　　Third, in this delegation to Korea, there were many worker representatives, and also about a dozen industrialists and businessmen. They jointly witnessed the destruction of the Korean battlefield and the actual manifestation of the spirit of hard struggle of the Chinese and Korean people. After returning to China, in this upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, they will be even more determined to actively develop production. I hope that the large, medium and small industrialists and businessmen (especially the medium and small entrepreneurs) and the national staff and workers will work together to improve labor-management relations. Industrialists and businessmen should sincerely implement the democratic management system, cultivate cadres, and improve technology; staff and workers should consciously develop the initiative and creativity of the working class. Labor and management unite as one, not only to support the front, overcome all the difficulties of wartime, but also to strive to build a better economy and modernized national defense.
　　Fourth, our industrialists and businessmen should specifically launch a nationwide donation campaign to support the front line of Resist America, Aid Korea. In this movement, industrialists and businessmen should play a leading and backbone role, so as not to fail the soldiers who are fighting hard, shedding blood and sacrificing at the front. We must know that our national industry and commerce have suffered all kinds of oppression and devastation from imperialist economic aggression, which made it almost impossible for us to turn over and breathe. After we were liberated, we gradually embarked on the path of development and prosperity, and the American imperialists saw it and were unwilling to give up, so they launched the Korean War, intending to invade China and make a comeback. So today we can live and work in peace and enjoy peace and happiness, thanks to the heroic killing of enemies by the soldiers at the front, repeatedly defeating the American imperialist aggressor bandits and their accomplices. If the Chinese People's Volunteer Army had not gone to Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, the flames of American imperialist aggression would have burned into the territory of our motherland long ago. The atrocities of American imperialism that our delegation representatives saw and heard in Korea would surely have fallen on our heads. Now our outstanding sons and daughters are continuing to fight bravely against the enemy in Korea. This just war of anti-aggression will undoubtedly lead to the final victory of the Chinese and Korean people. But American imperialism is a stubborn enemy. If we can do our best to specifically donate airplanes, cars, carts, stretcher carts, food, medicines, vitamin pills, medical equipment, cultural and entertainment supplies (such as books, newspapers, radios, recordings, etc.), we can not only improve the material conditions of our Volunteer Army, but also boost the morale of the front and make our victory come sooner! We should plan this glorious practical action in detail, launch it immediately, and enable all industrial and commercial people to participate together and actively transport it!
　　Finally, our industrialists and businessmen must unite with the people of the whole country to achieve: (1) resolutely support the resolution of the World Peace Council and oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan and making a separate peace with Japan; (2) strengthen the study of current affairs, recognize enemies and friends, and actively participate in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries; (3) strive to do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, so that the soldiers at the front and the logistics personnel have no worries, so that their courage and strength to kill the enemy are strengthened; especially in terms of resettling honorary soldiers, industrialists and businessmen should do their best to help complete this task; (4) resolutely support the government's policies and laws; the dross in the past thoughts must be thoroughly cleaned up, and we should have no idea of speculation and profiteering, tax evasion and tax evasion; we must strive to ensure price stability and the completion of tax revenue, which is an opportunity to serve the motherland and test ourselves.
　　Comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors! I thank you for giving me the glorious task of going to Korea to express my condolences. I have brought your love, wishes and gratitude to our Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army and the logistics personnel. I have told them how resolutely you have made patriotic pacts, how enthusiastically you have paraded and demonstrated, how enthusiastically you have paid taxes and made donations, and how you have supported this sacred war in various ways. They were all deeply moved after hearing the report of our delegation. They stood up and replied to us: As long as there is food, ammunition, and medicine, we can guarantee to drive the American bandits out of the Korean territory. The generals and soldiers on the front line in Korea are striving for greater victory. Our industrial and commercial sectors who live and work in peace in the motherland should repay the unparalleled heroism and bloodshed of the heroes with their own practical actions.

　　工商界应如何支援朝鲜前线
    中国赴朝慰问团第五分团副团长天津市工商界代表  朱继圣
    这次，我以一个工商界代表的身分，参加了中国人民赴朝慰问团。到朝鲜以后，使我最受感动而给我印象最深的，就是中朝两国人民所表现的那种比钢铁还要坚强的战斗意志，和那种运用智慧克服困难的乐观主义精神。不到朝鲜，不能深刻了解朝鲜人民所受的灾害之大。不到朝鲜，也不能彻底认识朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军与后勤工作人员作战条件之艰苦。这样的灾害与这样的艰苦，是世界历史上所罕有的。但是，在这样情况下，他们团结奋斗，一次接着一次地以无比的英勇打击敌人。这使我亲自体会了爱国主义和国际主义的意义和精神，并加强了我对于抗美战争必胜的认识和信心。
    我们工商界在去年抗美援朝运动开始时期，全国各地先后发动了汹涌澎湃的示威大游行，同时签订了爱国公约。这是爱国热情的表现。但是现在，我们后方人民必须更进一步、更具体地以实际行动来支援前线。我们要发动到工商业的各基层组织，把全国工商界整个动员起来，为支援前线而努力奋斗。
    首先，我们工商业者应在本岗位上积极工作和经营，我们要向朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军学习如何在艰苦的环境之下，英勇地运用智慧，掌握技术来克服一切困难，执行伟大任务。朝鲜农村因青年参军劳动力缺乏，耕牛百分之七八十又已被美匪军抢走或杀死，然而勇敢的朝鲜人民响应金日成将军的号召，发动了老少妇女，在敌机侵袭之下，夜以继日地将春耕播种工作用互助、变工等等办法及时完成。就这一件事实，就值得我们工商业者深刻学习。朝鲜民族工商业被美国侵略者破坏殆尽，但从美李匪军撤退以后，他们从废墟上努力建设，至今在平壤一处已建立了很多商店和工厂，尤其是制造生活必需品的工厂，如胶鞋工厂和铝碗工厂，都很好地恢复了。中国工商业的环境较优，虽有困难，我们应向朝鲜农民和工商界看齐，努力奋斗。我们还要学习志愿军的精神：“在战斗中找经验，在发展中找办法”。素来由国外输来的物资和器材，我们应设法自己制造，或研究出代用物品；我们更要大力促进城乡交流，用联营、合营种种方式来沟通土产的交流；这都是工商业者不可旁贷的责任。
    其次，我们必须广泛地研究使我们所制造的军需物资，尽量适应前线的情况。例如：
    （一）关于食品方面，我们应征求医生及营养专家们的意见，细加研究，使我们所制造的罐头食物都富有各种维他命，使前方指战员获得营养丰富的食品，伤病员能够迅速恢复健康。我们供给前方的罐头食物，最好多含油质、盐质及糖质。我国产豆产蛋最多，应研究尽量用大豆制成豆乳粉、豆腐干等等；用鸡蛋与味精、土豆合制一种蛋棒，供应前方。又前方指挥员曾向慰问团员提出意见，每种罐头食物，非特要富有营养，并应使其不易腐坏，打开后可以多吃几天。因此，罐头牛肉不如牛肉干、肉松、猪肝、牛肝或加盐猪油较为合宜。
    （二）关于药品方面，我们应研究自制各种维他命丸或其代用品，各种救伤消毒药料，各种防疫药品和针剂。现在夏令已至，传染病可能流行。而且，美国侵略者在朝鲜灭绝人性地使用细菌武器来毒害中朝人民军队和朝鲜人民，我们在前线应有准备地和细菌作斗争。
    （三）关于包装问题，我们也要注意到前方情况。我们生产上面这些东西，不但要绝对保证品质优良，而且要考虑到运输、装卸、保存等各方面的便利。例如：每箱重量不宜超过五十市斤，因战地搬运，每件最好能以一人扛运，较为迅便。其他对防雨、防潮、防火各点，在包装方面亦应加以注意。
    诸如此类，我们工商业者应当与职工们细心研究，务求配合前方的实际需要，时时刻刻给前方战士以最大的关切。
    第三，这次赴朝慰问团中，工人代表不少，工商业者也约有十余人。他们共同目睹了朝鲜战地被破坏的情况及中朝人民坚苦奋斗精神的实际表现。回国后，他们在此抗美援朝运动的高潮中，必将更加坚定积极发展生产的决心。我希望全国大、中、小工商业者（尤其是中、小企业者）和全国职工同志们共同努力，把劳资关系搞得更好。工商业者应诚心诚意推行民主管理制度，培养干部，改进技术；职工们应自觉地发扬工人阶级的积极性和创造性。劳资双方团结一致，不仅为支援前线，克服战时的一切困难而努力，并且为建设更好的经济和近代化的国防而奋斗。
    第四，我们工商业者应具体地发动一个全国性的捐献运动，来支援抗美援朝的前线。在这个运动中，工商业者应起一个带头作用和骨干作用，方不负前方坚苦奋斗、流血牺牲的战士们。我们要知道，我国民族工商业，曾经受过帝国主义经济侵略的种种压迫和摧残，使得我们几乎无法翻身喘气。我们得到解放以后，已逐渐步入了发展与繁荣的途径，而美帝国主义者看了，甚不甘心，于是发动朝鲜战争，意想侵入中国，卷土重来。所以今天我们能安居乐业，享受和平幸福，是由于前方战士们英勇杀敌，迭次打败美帝国主义侵略强盗及其帮凶的结果。倘没有中国人民志愿军去朝鲜与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，美帝国主义侵略火焰早已烧到了我们祖国的境内。我们慰问团代表们在朝鲜所见所闻的美帝国主义暴行，必定都轮到我们的头上。现在我国优秀的儿女正在朝鲜继续与敌人英勇斗争。这个正义的反侵略战争，毫无疑义地最后胜利必属于中朝人民。但美帝国主义是一个顽强的敌人，倘使我们能尽最大力量，具体地捐献飞机、汽车、大车、担架车、食品、药品、维他命丸、医疗器械、文化娱乐用品（如书报、收音机、录音片等等）等，我们不仅能增进我们志愿军的物质条件，并且更可鼓舞前方的士气，使我们的胜利提早到来！这个光荣的实际行动，我们应详细计划，立即发动，使全体工商界人士共同参加，踊跃输将！
    最后，我们工商业者要与全国人民团结在一起，作到：（一）坚决地拥护世界和平理事会的决议案，反对美帝国主义武装日本及单独对日媾和；（二）加强时事学习，认清敌友，积极参加镇压反革命的斗争；（三）努力搞好拥军优属工作，使前方战士和后勤工作人员没有丝毫顾虑，使他们杀敌的勇气和力量因而加强；尤其对安置荣誉军人方面，工商业者应尽最大力量来帮助这个任务的完成；（四）坚决地支持政府的政策和法令；过去思想上的渣滓，必须彻底扫除干净，我们应该丝毫没有投机倒把、漏税逃税的念头；我们必须努力保证物价的稳定和税收的完成，这正是报效祖国和考验自己的机会。
    工商界同志们！我谢谢你们给我赴朝慰问的光荣任务，我已将你们的热爱、愿望和感谢带给我们的志愿军、朝鲜人民军和后勤工作人员，我已告诉了他们，你们如何坚决地订立爱国公约，如何热烈地游行示威，如何踊跃地纳税捐款，你们如何以各种不同的方式来支持这个神圣的战争。他们听到我们慰问团报告之后，都感动万分。他们站起来回答我们说：只要有吃，有弹药，有医药，就可以保证把美国强盗赶出朝鲜国土以外。朝鲜前线的将士们正在争取更大的胜利，我们在祖国安居乐业的工商业界应该用自己的实际行动报答英雄们的无比英勇和流血牺牲。
