More than a Million Kilograms of Rice Wasted in Over a Year of Mining
　　Xiaoxipo Coal Mine Never Found a Coal Seam
　　Blind Construction is Truly Shocking

Blind mining, resulting in complete failure. The Xiaoxipo Mine of the Lingshan Coal Mine in Qu Yang County, Hebei Province, is a painful example from not so long ago. The Xiaoxipo Mine started construction in the spring of 1947 and ended in June 1948, taking more than a year. The result was that no coal seam was ever found, and work was forced to stop. At that time, the Xiaoxipo Mine was under the leadership of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government. It was more than forty miles from the county seat and more than a hundred miles from Zhengding Station on the Pinghan Railway, with only a road accessible to horse-drawn carts, making transportation extremely inconvenient. The Xiaoxipo mine shaft, with a diameter of thirteen feet, was an old shaft, about ten fathoms deep. It was previously operated by local private individuals, but was shut down due to insufficient funds. This time, the initial work was to restore the old shaft, and then continue digging down to a depth of more than twenty fathoms, but no coal seam was ever found. While digging the main shaft, a ventilation inclined shaft, several tens of fathoms long, was also dug. Before the shaft was dug, more than twenty cave dwellings were built to house the workers. After the shaft digging began, more than a hundred houses were built simultaneously. Among them were twenty tile-roofed houses, five large motor rooms, four large boiler rooms, five large foundry rooms, five large machine rooms, and four office rooms. In total, the digging of the shaft and the construction of the houses cost more than several billion Jin-Cha-Ji border currency, equivalent to more than a million kilograms of rice at the time.

The failure of the Xiaoxipo Mine completely exposed the error of relying solely on subjective wishes without regard to objective reality. Before digging the shaft, no detailed exploration or drilling was carried out, and construction was blindly undertaken. Beforehand, there was no knowledge of the coal reserves. They merely believed what the local people said, that there would definitely be good coal below thirty fathoms. They also assumed that since there were many small kilns around, the coal must be abundant, but after more than a year of digging, no coal seam was found. At the time, the purpose of digging the shaft was to supply military and civilian needs, but they did not consider the inconvenient local transportation and the abundance of small kilns. Even if coal could be produced, it would be difficult to sell locally. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, factories moved away one after another, further eliminating the supply targets. Especially under the conditions of insufficient technology and material equipment at that time, they blindly insisted on pushing forward. Without engineers, they relied on the experience of the local people in using handicrafts to build small kilns. Without mechanical equipment such as high-lift trucks, ventilation fans, and electric drills, they relied solely on manpower and indigenous methods to carry out a large-scale, modern mining project. Therefore, the more they dug, the more difficulties they encountered, and they finally failed. Moreover, engaging in a large amount of housing construction before discovering a coal seam was truly too imprudent.

### 开矿一年多，费米数百余万斤  小西坡煤矿根本没见煤层  盲目施工情况实属惊人

　　开矿一年多，费米数百余万斤
    小西坡煤矿根本没见煤层
　  盲目施工情况实属惊人
    盲目开矿，结果完全失败。河北省曲阳县灵山煤矿小西坡矿，是一个过去还不太久的痛心的例子。小西坡矿从一九四七年春季动工到一九四八年六月结束，费时一年有余，结果根本找不见煤层而被迫停工。小西坡矿当时属晋察冀边区政府领导，距县城四十余里，距平汉路正定车站百余里，只有公路一条，可通马车，交通极不方便。小西坡矿井口直径为一丈三尺，系旧井口，约十丈深，过去为当地私人所办，后因财力不足而停办。这次开采，首先恢复旧井口，又继续向下打至二十余丈深，但始终不见煤层。在打大井时，并打有一个通风斜井，长数十丈。在未打井以前，又打有窑洞二十余个，供工人住宿。打井开始后，同时进行建筑房屋百余间。其中有瓦房二十间，电机房五大间，锅炉房四大间，翻砂房五大间，机器房五大间，办公房屋四间等，总计打井及建筑房屋等，共用晋察冀边币数十余亿元，折合当时米价，合数百余万斤米。
    小西坡矿开采的失败，完全暴露了只凭主观愿望不管客观实际情况的错误。在打井之前，既未经过详细勘察，也未进行钻探，即盲目进行施工。事先对煤的埋藏量毫无所知，只听当地老百姓说打三十丈以下一定会有好煤，就信以为真。又以为周围小窑很多，煤一定不会少，但是打了一年多也未见煤层。当时打井的目的，是为了供给军需民用，但并未考虑到当地交通不便，小窑很多，即使能出煤，在当地也难销售；待石家庄解放后，工厂相继迁移，更失掉了供应的对象。尤其在当时没有充分的技术及物质设备的条件下，竟盲目硬干。没有工程师，就靠老百姓手工业打小窑的经验；没有高车、扇风机及电钻等机械设备，就单靠人力及土法来进行一个大规模的现代化的开凿矿井的工作；因此，愈打困难愈多，终于失败，而且在没有发现煤层时，即从事大量房屋建筑，实属太不慎重。
