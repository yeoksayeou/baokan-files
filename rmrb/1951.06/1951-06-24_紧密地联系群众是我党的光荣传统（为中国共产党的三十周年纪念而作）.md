　　Closely Connecting with the Masses is Our Party's Glorious Tradition
  (Written for the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China)
	       Deng Xiaoping
	We welcome the thirtieth anniversary of the Communist Party of China with extreme excitement.

	From its very beginning, our Party was established on the basis of the Chinese workers' movement, according to Marxism-Leninism and the principles of the Bolshevik Party building in Russia. Therefore, it possessed high discipline, combat effectiveness, and an inseparable connection with the Chinese people from its early days. Once it appeared on the political stage, it took on the leading responsibility for the Chinese revolution. The disaster-stricken, hardworking, intelligent, and courageous Chinese people had continuously waged heroic struggles against imperialism and feudalism, shedding much blood, but could not find a correct path. Only our Party pointed out this path to them, only our Party, in accordance with the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific realities of China, prescribed a correct political line for the Chinese people. "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." The Chinese working class and all working people, from their own experiences, recognized that the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program under the leadership of the proletariat was the only correct path for them to achieve liberation, and the Communist Party was their hope. Their trust in our Party has remained the same for thirty years. The Communist Party members' spirit of fighting selflessly and advancing wave upon wave served as an example for the revolutionary masses, and they became the masses' closest comrades and comrades-in-arms. From then on, the Chinese revolution appeared on an unprecedented scale. It was so organized and tenacious that the reactionary rulers' massacres were not enough to disperse our ranks, and countless setbacks were not enough to damage the confidence of Communist Party members and revolutionary people in the inevitable victory of the revolution. Even in the years of the most severe White Terror, "The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people were neither intimidated, nor conquered, nor exterminated. They rose from the ground, wiped away the bloodstains, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight." (Mao Zedong: On Coalition Government) The blood of countless Communist Party members and revolutionary people flowed together, solidifying into an unbreakable connection. It was precisely by relying on this flesh-and-blood connection that the Chinese revolution was endowed with infinite life, thereby achieving the great victory of the Chinese revolution following the great October Socialist Revolution.

	Chinese Communists deeply understand that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of such a profound connection between the Chinese Party and the Chinese people are inseparable from the name of Comrade Mao Zedong. The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" undoubtedly will more firmly establish the ideological and theoretical foundation for the Chinese Party. It is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism and a summary of the practical experience of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding model of applying Marxism-Leninism to the actual situation in China, and an outstanding model of applying the principles of Lenin and Stalin in building and leading the Bolshevik Party to building and leading the Chinese Party. He repeatedly used the teachings of "Seek Truth from Facts," "Proceeding from Actual Conditions in Everything," and "From the Masses, to the Masses, Concentrate, Persevere" to nurture our Party and to teach us Communist Party members. In his report "On Coalition Government" at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, he pointed out: "Another distinct characteristic that distinguishes us Communists from any other political party is our closest connection with the broadest masses of the people. Serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly, never departing from the masses for a moment; proceeding from the interests of the people in everything, and not from the interests of one's own small group or one's own personal interests; the unity of responsibility to the people and responsibility to the leading organs; these are our starting points. Communists must be ready to uphold the truth at all times, because any truth is in the interest of the people. Communists must be ready to correct mistakes at all times, because any mistake is not in the interest of the people. Twenty-four years of experience tell us that all correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in line with the demands of the masses at that time and in that place, and are connected with the masses. All incorrect tasks, policies, and work styles are not in line with the demands of the masses at that time and in that place, and are divorced from the masses. The reason why the evils of dogmatism, empiricism, commandism, tailism, sectarianism, bureaucracy, warlordism, and an arrogant and self-important work attitude are definitely bad and definitely unacceptable, and if anyone has such evils, they must be corrected, is because they are divorced from the masses." Comrade Mao Zedong also said in the same report: "The Communist Party of China, armed with the theory of Marxism, has produced a new style of work among the Chinese people, which is mainly the style of combining theory with practice, the style of being closely linked with the masses of the people, and the style of self-criticism." It was precisely with this thorough materialism and love for the masses that Comrade Mao Zedong led the entire Party, defeated all kinds of opportunism, overcame and is overcoming all kinds of work styles that are divorced from the masses from the feudal class, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie, and established a Bolshevik-style correct work style.

	Chinese Communists have realized the greatness of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions from their own experience. It is because they have basically followed these instructions that they have been able to achieve results in their work under the leadership of the Party's correct line; and when they have violated these instructions, they have inevitably made mistakes, suffered setbacks in actual struggles, and harmed the revolutionary cause.

	Connecting with the masses is the glorious tradition of our Party. Our Party's local organizations have generally learned the method of "From the masses, to the masses, concentrate, persevere," understand how to combine the central government's policies with the local actual conditions, and understand that the masses' reactions are a mirror for measuring whether the Party's policies and work methods are correct, and based on this, correct their own mistakes, wash away the bureaucratic dust on their bodies, and improve their work methods. Therefore, the Party's policies can meet the demands of the masses, the Party's slogans immediately turn into the actions of the masses, our every specific work task can overcome all difficulties, eliminate all obstacles, and achieve complete victory on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary actions, and in every step of the movement, patiently educate the masses, raise the masses' political awareness, and lead the masses to continue to advance.

	Our Party history proves that as long as we do not separate from the masses and always maintain close contact with the masses, we will be invincible. This can be proven not only in the workers' movement, the peasants' movement, and other movements, but also in the work of the revolutionary army under the most concentrated leadership of our Party. The People's Army founded by Comrade Mao Zedong is an example of being good at connecting with the masses. In the internal relations between officers and soldiers in the army, on the basis of centralization, the principles of political democracy, economic democracy, and military democracy are implemented appropriately, thereby thoroughly eliminating the warlordism of the old army, highly developing the consciousness and creativity of the troops, consolidating the unity between officers and soldiers, and enhancing discipline; thereby making our army a force with high combat effectiveness. In terms of military-civilian relations, the principle of military-civilian unity is implemented, and the principle that the army is not only a fighting force but also a working team for mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and protecting the interests of the masses is implemented. Therefore, it has established a fish-and-water relationship with the masses. It is not only a powerful fighting force that defeated American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and achieved revolutionary victory, but also a political army highly armed with Mao Zedong Thought and cultivated with the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people.

	Connecting with the masses and being loyal and highly responsible to the people's cause inevitably has a constant and profound impact on our Party's internal life. The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, taking our Party Central Committee as a model, is good at analyzing and grasping the concrete and vivid situation of revolutionary practice, deciding and reviewing the Party's policies and strategies based on the masses' level of consciousness and organization, and educating workers, peasants, and all working people with proletarian ideology. In every movement, it possesses broad mass character. Every step of the movement raises the masses' political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm, further deepens the connection between the Party and the masses, and consolidates the leadership of the proletariat and its political party. Our Party is also good at examining the positions, viewpoints, and work styles of organizations at all levels and every Party member based on the actual reactions of the mass movement, thereby making it easy to discover achievements and promote achievements, discover shortcomings and correct shortcomings; thereby making it easy to discover all kinds of opportunism and non-proletarian ideology, and quickly overcome them; thereby making it easy to discover class alien elements and speculators who have infiltrated the Party, and purge them. The lively and vigorous revolutionary actions of the masses have nurtured our Party, constantly infusing new blood into the Party, educating our Party members, raising their political awareness and ideological level, and strengthening the Party's Bolshevization.

	The victorious Chinese people are carrying out a series of sharp struggles to consolidate the revolutionary victory, eliminate the influence of imperialism, and sweep away the remnants of feudalism. These struggles are concentrated in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counterrevolutionaries. The scale of these movements, the speed of their effectiveness, and the profound impact on people's thinking are unprecedented. The results of these movements will inevitably lay a rock-solid foundation for our country, open up a broad path for the country's industrialization, bring a happy life to the people, and enhance enormous strength in the cause of opposing imperialism and defending world peace. The reason why these movements have achieved great success is because the policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee completely conform to the demands of the people, and it is also because our local organizations and Communist Party members have further understood Mao Zedong Thought, implemented and developed the working method of closely connecting the leadership with the masses. The people are so enthusiastic that they accept every task of the Party and the People's Government with the highest trust, they respond to every call for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; they automatically confiscate and distribute land within the scope of government decrees; they automatically report and capture counterrevolutionaries, and participate in the trial of counterrevolutionaries; they display high labor enthusiasm in industrial and agricultural production; they regard Chairman Mao as their savior, tear down the idols, and enshrine Chairman Mao's portrait. All of this is inseparable from the people's belief in the Party and Chairman Mao, and it is also inseparable from the Party's correct policies and correct working methods of closely connecting with the masses in the current movement.

	Of course, it is not to say that we are all well and everything is good. On the contrary, our Party still has many major weaknesses. As a whole, the Communist Party of China, highly armed with Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, is glorious and great, and the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong is wise and correct. However, from the perspective of our many local organizations, we often make some mistakes, and we often need the help of the Central Committee to correct our mistakes and continue to advance. If we take the members of the Party organization as an example, we still have greater weaknesses. We have a large number of Party members who come from petty-bourgeois intellectuals and peasant backgrounds, and a large number of new Party members who have revolutionary enthusiasm but do not understand revolutionary theory and methods. They either have a superficial understanding of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, or they do not understand it at all. There are even a few Party members who are of poor character and lack feelings for workers, peasants, and other working people. Their actions not only separate them from the masses but also damage the Party's prestige. Even some of our Party members who have been in the Party for a long time still lack theoretical cultivation. Many comrades only have rich but fragmented fighting experience, and lack a systematic theory to consolidate these experiences. Therefore, they inevitably make dogmatic mistakes at times, and empiricist mistakes at other times, and commandist mistakes at other times, and tailist mistakes at other times. Sometimes they can connect with the masses and do a good job, and sometimes they are separated from the masses and do a terrible job. Some of our comrades have also become arrogant in the face of victory, thinking that they have a lot of experience, and do not investigate the actual situation when encountering problems, do not consult with the masses, and issue orders from above, thereby making mistakes and running into snags.

	Overcoming these weaknesses, strengthening the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, improving the level of Party members, and purifying the Party organization are the consistent instructions of our Party Central Committee. In this regard, we have been continuously working, but because this is a more arduous task than fighting imperialism, fighting Chiang Kai-shek, and fighting feudalism, and it is a more fundamental task for ensuring revolutionary progress, it requires the unremitting efforts of our entire Party.

	The further Bolshevization of the Party in ideology and organization, and the Party's forever maintaining the closest connection with the masses, are the guarantee of the victory of the Chinese people's cause and the inexhaustible source of revolutionary life.

	In the conclusion of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course, Comrade Stalin, after citing a vivid ancient Greek myth, taught us: "I think the Bolsheviks are quite like the hero Antaeus in Greek mythology. They are also like Antaeus. The reason why they are strong and powerful is because they maintain contact with their mother, that is, with the masses who gave birth to, nurtured, and taught them. Therefore, as long as they still maintain contact with their mother, with the people, they can always maintain their invincible position with confidence. This is the key to the strong and invincible leadership of the Bolsheviks."

	Comrade Mao Zedong said: Our victory in overthrowing imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is only the first step in the Long March of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, we must not be arrogant because of victory, but should abide by the teachings of Stalin and Mao Zedong, maintain the glorious tradition of our Party, closely connect with the masses, and guide the masses towards greater victories.

	The brilliance of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought shines on the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Our Party will forever advance together with the Chinese people, constantly defeat the conspiracies and tricks of enemies at home and abroad, build our country, and go all the way to socialism and communism.

　　紧密地联系群众是我党的光荣传统
  （为中国共产党的三十周年纪念而作）
        邓小平
    我们以极其兴奋的心情来迎接中国共产党的三十周年纪念日。
    我党从开创之日起，就是在中国工人运动的基础上，依据马列主义和俄国布尔什维克建党的原则建立起来的，因而它在幼年时代就具有高度的纪律性、战斗性以及和中国人民血肉不可分离的联系。它一经出现在政治舞台，就担当起中国革命的领导责任。灾难深重而又勤劳、聪明、勇敢的中国人民，曾不断地进行了反对帝国主义和封建主义统治的英勇斗争，流了很多的血，但是找不出一条正确的道路，惟有我们党向他们指出了这条道路，惟有我们党依照马列主义的普遍真理结合中国的具体实际，为中国人民规定了一条正确的政治路线。“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量”。中国工人阶级和一切劳动人民从切身的经验中，认识到在无产阶级领导下的反帝反封建的纲领，是使他们获得解放的唯一正确的路线，共产党就是他们的希望，他们对于我党的信赖，三十年如一日。共产党员奋不顾身、前仆后继的战斗精神，作了革命群众的榜样，他们成为群众最亲密的战友和同志。从此中国革命出现了空前的规模，它是那样地具有组织性和坚韧性，反动统治者的屠杀不足以打散我们的队伍，无数次的挫折不足以损害共产党员和革命人民对于革命必然胜利的信心，即使在白色恐怖最严重的年份里，“中国共产党与中国人民并没有被吓倒、被征服、被杀绝，他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”（毛泽东：论联合政府）无数的共产党员和革命人民的血流在一起，凝固成牢不可破的联系，正是依靠了这样血肉的联系，赋予了中国革命以无限的生命，从而取得了在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后另一次的中国革命的伟大胜利。
    中国共产党人深刻地体会到：中国革命的胜利，中国党与中国人民建立了这样深厚的联系，是与毛泽东同志的名字分不开的。毛泽东同志的《实践论》的发表，无疑地将为中国党更坚固地树立起思想的和理论的基础，它是马列主义的光辉的发展，是中国革命实际经验的总结。毛泽东同志是把马列主义运用于中国实际的杰出的模范，是把列宁、斯大林建设和领导布尔什维克党的原理，运用于建设和领导中国党的杰出的模范，他千百次地把《实事求是》《一切从实际出发》《由群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去》这些教言来灌溉我们的党，来教导我们共产党员，他在党的第七次代表大会上《论联合政府》的报告中指出：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。全心全意地为中国人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民利益出发，而不是从自己小集团或自己的个人利益出发；向人民负责与向领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是适合人民利益的。共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不适合人民利益的。二十四年的经验告诉我们，凡属正确的任务、政策及工作作风，都是同当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的。凡属错误了的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。教条主义、经验主义、命令主义、尾巴主义、宗派主义、官僚主义、军阀主义、骄傲自大的工作态度等项弊端之所以一定不好，一定要不得，如果什么人有了这样弊端就一定要改正，就是因为他们脱离群众”。毛泽东同志又在同一报告中说：“在马克思主义的理论思想武装之下的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要地就是理论与实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风与自我批评的作风。”毛泽东同志正是以这种彻底的唯物主义和热爱群众的思想，领导全党，战胜了各色各式的机会主义，克服了和正在克服着来自封建阶级、资产阶级和小资产阶级的各色各式的脱离群众的工作作风，树立了布尔什维克式的正确的工作作风。
    中国共产党人从自己的经验中认识到毛泽东同志这些指示的伟大性。正是由于他们基本上遵从了这些指示，他们才能在党的正确路线的领导下，把工作做出成绩来；而当他们违背了这些指示的时候，他们就不可避免地要犯错误，在实际斗争中碰得头破血流，并使革命事业遭受损害。
    联系群众是我党的光荣传统，我们党的地方组织一般地都学会了“由群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去”的方法，懂得如何把中央的方针与本地的实际情况结合起来，懂得把群众的反映当作衡量党的政策和工作方法是否正确的一面镜子，并据以改正自己的错误，洗刷自己身上的官僚主义灰尘，改进工作方法。所以，党的方针能够符合群众的要求，党的口号立即变为群众的行动，我们的每一项具体工作任务都能在群众自觉自愿的行动基础上，战胜一切困难，扫除一切障碍，取得完满的胜利，并在运动的每一步中，耐心地去教育群众，提高群众的政治觉悟，并领导群众继续前进。
    我们的党史证明了，只要我们不脱离群众，和群众始终保持着紧密的联系，我们就会无往而不胜利。这不但在工人运动、农民运动和其他一切运动中可以得到证明，就是在我党领导最集中的革命军队的工作中，也可以得到证明。毛泽东同志所手创的人民军队就是善于联系群众的榜样。在军队内部的官兵关系方面，在集中的基础上，恰如其份地实行了政治民主、经济民主和军事民主的原则，从而彻底地清除了旧军队的军阀主义，高度地发挥了部队的自觉性和创造性，巩固了官兵之间的团结，增强了纪律性；从而使我们的军队锻炼成了具有高度战斗力的力量。在军民关系方面，实行了军民团结的原则，实行了军队不单是战斗队、而且是发动群众、组织群众、保护群众利益的工作队的原则，因而它同群众建立了鱼水的联系，它既发动了群众，又获得了群众的支持。它不但是战胜了美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派、取得革命胜利的一支强大的战斗大军，而且是以毛泽东思想高度武装起来和以中国人民的革命精神培植起来的一支政治大军。
    联系群众，为人民事业忠贞不屈、高度负责的作风，对于我们党的内部生活，必然地发生经常的深刻的影响。用马列主义——毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党，以我们党的中央为模范，善于分析和掌握革命实际的具体生动的情况，依据群众的觉悟程度和组织程度来决定和审查党的方针、政策和策略，并以无产阶级的思想去教育工人农民和一切劳动人民，而在每一次每一步的运动中，都具有广大的群众性，运动的每一步都提高了群众的政治觉悟和革命积极性，都更加密切了党与群众的联系，巩固了无产阶级及其政党的领导。我们党还善于根据群众运动的实际反映来检查各级组织和每个党员的立场、观点和工作作风，从而易于发现成绩和发扬成绩，发现缺点和纠正缺点；从而易于发现各色各式的机会主义和非无产阶级的思想，迅速地加以克服；从而易于发现混进党内的阶级异己分子和投机分子，并加以清洗。生动活泼的群众革命行动，抚育了我们的党，不断地给党灌输进新的血液，教育了我们的党员，提高了他们的政治觉悟和思想水平，加强了党的布尔什维克化。
    胜利了的中国人民，正在进行着巩固革命胜利、清除帝国主义的影响、扫荡封建主义的残渣的一系列的尖锐的斗争，这些斗争集中表现于抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命这三大运动上面。这些运动的规模之大，收效之快，对于人民思想影响之深刻，为空前所未有。这些运动的结果，必然地将给我们的国家奠定稳如泰山的基础，将给国家工业化开辟一条广阔的道路，将给人民带来幸福的生活，将在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的事业中增强巨大的力量。这些运动之所以获得伟大的成绩，是由于毛泽东同志和党中央所订的方针，完全符合于人民的要求，同样是由于我们的地方组织和共产党员对于毛泽东思想有了进一步的体会，贯彻和发挥了领导与群众相结合的密切联系群众的工作方法。人民群众是那样的热情，他们以最高信赖的心情来接受党和人民政府的每一个任务，他们响应关于抗美援朝的每一个号召；他们在政府法令的范围内自动地没收和分配土地；他们自动地检举和捕捉反革命分子，参加对于反革命分子的审判；他们在工业和农业生产中发挥着高度的劳动热忱；他们把毛主席当作他们的救星，撕下了神像，供上了毛主席像，所有这些，都是同人民对于党和毛主席的信仰分不开的，也是同党在当前运动中的正确的方针和正确的密切联系群众的工作方法分不开的。
    当然不是说，我们已经万事大吉，一切都是好的，相反的，我们党还存在着不少重大的弱点。作为整体来说，以马列主义——毛泽东思想高度武装起来的中国共产党是光荣的、伟大的，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导是英明的、正确的。但是从我们许多地方组织来说，我们常常要犯一些错误，我们常常要在中央的帮助下，才能纠正错误而继续前进。如果拿党的组织成员来说，我们就还存在着更大的弱点。我们有大量的出身于小资产阶级知识分子和农民成份的党员，有大量的新党员，他们具有革命的热情，但不懂得革命理论和方法，他们对于马列主义——毛泽东思想或者一知半解，或者不知不解。甚至有少数党员品质恶劣，缺乏对工人农民和其他劳动群众的感情，他们的行动不但脱离了群众而且损害了党的威信。就是我们一些党龄较长的党员，也还缺乏理论的修养，不少同志只有丰富的但是零碎的斗争经验，而缺乏系统的理论把这些经验巩固起来，因而他们难免有时犯教条主义的错误，有时又犯经验主义的错误，有时犯命令主义的错误，有时又犯尾巴主义的错误，有时能够联系群众把工作做得很好，有时又脱离群众把工作做得很糟。我们还有一些同志在胜利的面前骄傲起来，自以为经验很多，遇事不考察实际，不同群众商量，坐在上面发号施令，因而犯错误，碰钉子。
    克服这些弱点，加强马列主义——毛泽东思想的理论学习，提高党员的水平，纯洁党的组织，这是我党中央一贯的指示。在这方面，我们已经进行了不断的工作，但因为这是一件比之打帝国主义、打蒋介石、打封建更为艰巨的，对于保障革命前进更为根本的工作，需要我们全党不疲倦的努力。
    党在思想上和组织上更进一步的布尔什维克化，和党与群众永远保持着最密切的联系，是中国人民事业胜利的保证和取之不尽用之不竭的革命生命的源泉。
    斯大林同志在联共党史的结束语中，在引述了生动的古希腊神话之后，教导我们说：“我认为布尔什维克颇与希腊神话中的英雄安泰相像。他们也同安泰一样，其所以强而有力，就是因为他们与自己的母亲，即是与生育、抚养并把他们教导出来的群众保持着联系。所以他们只要还是与自己的母亲，与民众保持着联系，那他们就能始终稳有把握地保持住他们那种不可战胜的地位。这就是布尔什维克的领导坚强有力而不可战胜的关键。”
    毛泽东同志说：我们打倒帝国主义和国民党反动统治的胜利，只不过是中国革命中万里长征走完了第一步。所以，我们不能因胜而骄，而应谨守着斯大林毛泽东的教言，保持我党的光荣传统，紧密地联系着群众，引导群众走向更大的胜利。
    马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着中国共产党和中国人民。我们的党将永远同中国人民一道前进，不断地战胜内外敌人的阴谋诡计，建设我们的国家，一直走到社会主义和共产主义。
