Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th (TASS dispatch): The Soviet Union has begun implementing a new summer flight schedule, with more passenger planes, mail planes, and freighters serving the Moscow-Kuibyshev line, the Moscow-Stalingrad line, and the Moscow-Ashkhabad line. New air routes will connect Moscow with Nukus, the capital of the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic, one of the construction centers of the Turkmen Main Canal. Airplanes traveling on the Moscow-Kherson line will also serve the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station construction project. The Vnukovo Airport near Moscow is world-renowned. From this airport, airplanes connect the capital with various Union Republics, state centers, and frontier region centers. Since the beginning of spring, Soviet air transport has greatly increased. Activity at Vnukovo Airport never slows down for a minute. Express flights fly to Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk, Irkutsk, Vladivostok, and South Sakhalin late at night. At dawn, dozens of other planes fly to all parts of the country. Recently, approximately one thousand tons of air-transported goods have been delivered to areas undergoing massive construction projects.
    
    Civil aviation pilots have rich experience in long-distance and high-speed flights. Several pilots already have records of flying two million kilometers or even more. A few days ago, Soviet aviator Malkin was warmly welcomed by the masses when he landed at Vnukovo Airport. He flew a comfortable express passenger plane from Kiev, completing his third million kilometers of flight. In his twenty years of service in civil aviation, Malkin has spent 15,000 hours in the air and has trained more than a hundred pilots. He has flown on all aviation routes in the country: in the South, North, Far East, and Central Asia. During the Great Patriotic War, he bravely flew many times to Soviet guerrilla areas. He participated in the air battles of Sevastopol and Stalingrad. Once, Malkin led his pilots courageously repelled an attack by ten fascist bandit aircraft; despite being vastly outnumbered, Malkin led his pilots to shoot down one enemy plane. Malkin's aviation mechanic, Bapsa, has worked with Malkin for many years. Bapsa's personal record is two million kilometers.

　　苏联航空事业发展
    新航线将为共产主义建设服务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五月十四日电：苏联已经开始实行夏季新的飞行时间表，将有更多的客机、邮机和运货机在莫斯科——古比雪夫线、莫斯科——斯大林格勒线、莫斯科——阿什哈巴德线上服务。新航空线将把莫斯科和土库曼大运河建筑工程中心之一——卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国首都纽库斯连接起来。在莫斯科——刻松线上来往的飞机也将为卡霍夫卡水电站建筑工程服务。莫斯科附近富努科伏机场是世界驰名的。从这个飞机场起飞的飞机，把首都和各加盟共和国、各州中心、各边疆区中心连接在一起。自从春季开始以来，苏联空中运输已经大量增加。富努科伏机场上的活动一分钟也不松懈。快班飞机在深夜飞往新西伯利亚、伯力、伊尔库茨克、海参崴和南萨哈连。在黎明时分，其它几十架飞机飞往全国各地。最近，约有一千吨空中运输的货物已经送达进行庞大建筑工程的地带。
    民用航空队的驾驶员对实行长距离的和高速度的飞行有丰富的经验。若干驾驶员已经有飞行二百万公里甚至更多的纪录。几天以前，苏联飞行家马尔金在富努科伏机场降落时受到群众热烈的欢迎。他驾驶一架舒适的快班客机从基辅起飞，这次飞行完成了他的第三个一百万公里的飞行。马尔金在民用航空服务的二十年间，在空中度过了一万五千小时，训练了一百多名驾驶员。他曾经在全国所有的航空线上飞行过：在南方、北方、远东和中亚细亚。在伟大的卫国战争期间，他有很多次勇敢地飞到苏联的游击区去。他参加过悉瓦斯托波尔和斯大林格勒的空战。有一次马尔金率领驾驶员们英勇地击退了十架法西斯匪机的进攻，马尔金率领驾驶员在敌人的绝对优势之下击落了一架敌机。马尔金的航空机械士巴普莎曾经和马尔金一起工作了许多年。巴普莎个人纪录是二百万公里。
