　　Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Wuchang Dispatch: Over 84,000 representatives from all circles in Wuchang held a rally at the Wuchang Stadium on the 26th of last month, accusing Guo Shiji, an American bishop of the Catholic Wuchang Diocese, and Xu Laide, an American vice-bishop, of the towering crime of harming more than 16,000 Chinese children at the Garden Hill Orphanage. The infant remains, filling five large coffins dug up from Garden Hill, were transported to the venue as evidence.

　　Nuns Liu Cuiying and orphans Hu Meiqing, Liu Jinqiu, and Zhou Yizhen from the orphanage, tearfully accused Guo Shiji, Xu Laide, and American nuns of abusing Chinese children. Liu Cuiying said: "In two years, I personally witnessed more than two thousand children being killed by Xu Laide and the American nuns." Their accusations aroused the anger of all the representatives, and shouts of "Avenge the children!" constantly echoed from around the venue.

　　Lin Fusheng, Liu Shunzhou, Wang Birun, and other representatives from the Catholic Church United Hospital employees exposed Xu Laide's theft and sale of materials donated by the Chinese people. Wang Birun said: "Before and after the liberation of Wuhan, Xu Laide stole and sold a large amount of wheat, flour, bed sheets, and medical equipment donated to the hospital by the Chinese people. In 1946, he stole and sold a large portion of the hospital's more than three thousand cases of medicine."

　　Left Lianzhi, a female worker from Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, and Fang Dagu, a female worker from the First Yarn Factory, who had lost their children, couldn't help but cry out loud when they walked to the accusation platform and saw the withered bones of infants filling the five large coffins. Many people on and off the stage were moved to tears. They shouted with grief and indignation on the stage: "We demand that the People's Government avenge us!" The more than 80,000 people offstage roared together: "Severely punish the murderers Guo Shiji and Xu Laide!" "Demand blood debts from the American imperialist elements!"

　　Representatives from workers, students, Young Pioneers, and religious circles spoke at the meeting, unanimously demanding that the People's Government severely punish these murderers who harmed Chinese children. The presidium of the conference received more than 700 notes from representatives of all circles demanding severe punishment for Guo Shiji and Xu Laide, including a signature book signed by all the Young Pioneers of Wuchang No. 13 Elementary School and Sanyi Elementary School with their names forming the four characters "Blood Debt Must Be Repaid". The presidium of the conference announced on the spot that these accusations and the just demands of the people from all circles would be submitted to the Municipal People's Government for handling according to law, and the whole venue immediately burst into warm applause and cheers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 2nd: The Nanjing People's Court pronounced judgment on the case of foreign nuns of the "Nanjing Sacred Heart Children's Home" abusing and killing Chinese children on May 31st, sentencing the former nuns of the home, Bai Jiezhen, Bai Anqi, and other seven criminals to imprisonment or deportation according to the seriousness of their circumstances.

　　Bai Jiezhen, Bai Anqi, and other criminals consistently used "religion" and "charity" as a cover to wantonly harm Chinese children in the children's home, causing serious deaths among the children in the home. The Nanjing Military Control Commission accepted the demands of the people from all walks of life and ordered the Nanjing Branch of the China People's Relief Administration to take over the hospital on April 17th. After the association took over, a large number of infant corpses were unearthed in the vegetable garden of the hospital, which increased the seriousness of the case and aroused greater anger among the people from all walks of life. The Nanjing Military Control Commission then arrested Bai and others and sent them to the Municipal People's Court for trial.

　　Since accepting the case, the Nanjing People's Court has conducted investigations in all aspects and confirmed that the children's home, under the direction of foreign nuns, consistently abused and killed Chinese children, causing the deaths of 101 infants in just ten months from June 1950 to April this year. All of the 58 surviving children (previously mistakenly reported as 60) suffer from malnutrition, including 21 with tuberculosis and 33 with skin diseases, with the children in the worst condition suffering from five diseases. Bai Jiezhen and others used the older children as beasts of burden, forcing them to do labor beyond their physical capabilities, and arbitrarily beat, scolded, and imprisoned them. Bai and others confessed to all of the above facts in court. The People's Court punished them according to the degree of responsibility, the seriousness of the crime, and the degree of repentance: Bai Jiezhen (French) and Bai Anqi (Portuguese), the heads of the hospital, were sentenced to ten years in prison; Bai Shuzhen (French), Lang Xueru (French), Yu Tianyou (Austrian), and Ai Shengxin (Polish), who were directly responsible for the care and nursing of children, not only failed to fulfill their duties but also deliberately abused Chinese children, were immediately and permanently deported from the territory of the People's Republic of China; Yun Nansi (Italian) showed some remorse during the trial, and considering that her crime was relatively minor, she was leniently dealt with, reprimanded and released and given a deadline to leave the country.

　　武昌各界人民代表八万余人集会
    控诉天主教美籍主教残害我儿童万六千名
    南京人民法院判处杀害我儿童的两外籍修女十年徒刑
    【新华社四日讯】武昌讯：武昌各界人民代表八万四千余人于上月二十六日在武昌体育场举行大会，控诉天主教武昌教区美籍主教郭时济和美籍副主教徐赉德等在花园山育婴堂残害了一万六千多个中国儿童的滔天罪行。人们从花园山掘出来的装满了五口大棺材的婴儿尸骨，被运到会场作证。
    育婴堂修女刘翠英和孤女胡梅清、刘金秋、周仪珍等，都在会上一字一泪地控诉了郭时济、徐赉德和美籍修女虐待中国儿童的罪行。刘翠英说：我在两年内亲眼看见被徐赉德和美国修女害死的儿童就有两千多名。她们的控诉激起了全体代表的愤怒，从会场四周不断地发出“为孩子们报仇”的吼声。
    天主堂联合医院职工代表林福盛、刘顺舟、王必润等揭露了徐赉德盗卖中国人民捐助的物资。王必润说：徐赉德在武汉市解放前后，曾盗卖了中国人民捐给该医院的大批小麦、面粉、被单和医药器材。在一九四六年，他曾把医院的三千多箱药材盗卖去一大部分。
    失去了孩子的震寰纱厂女工左莲芝、第一纱厂女工方大姑，当她们走到控诉台前看到五口大棺材中满装着婴儿的枯骨时，不禁失声痛哭，台上台下许多人都被感动得流泪。她们在台上悲愤地高呼：“要求人民政府替我们报仇！”台下的八万多人一齐发出了怒吼：“严办凶手郭时济、徐赉德！”“向美帝国主义分子索还血债！”
    工人、学生、少年儿童队员和宗教界的代表都在会上讲了话，他们一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这些残害中国儿童的凶手。大会主席团收到各界人民代表交来的主张严办郭时济、徐赉德的条子有七百多张，其中有武昌十三小学和三一小学全体少年儿童队员用他们的名字签成“血债血还”四个大字的签名书。大会主席团当场宣布将这些控诉材料及各界人民的正义要求，送请市人民政府依法处理，全场立即响起热烈的掌声和欢呼声。
    【新华社南京二日电】南京市人民法院于五月三十一日宣判“南京圣心儿童院”外籍修女虐杀中国儿童一案，对该院前修女白洁贞、白安琪等七犯按其情节轻重，分别判处徒刑或驱逐出境。
    白洁贞、白安琪等犯一贯以“宗教”、“慈善”为幌子，在儿童院内肆意残害中国儿童，曾造成该院儿童严重的死亡。南京市军事管制委员会接受各界人民的要求，于四月十七日责令中国人民救济总会南京分会接管该院。该会接管后，在该院菜园地里又掘出大批婴尸，这就增加了案情的严重性，同时激起了各界人民更大的愤怒。南京市军事管制委员会乃将白犯等逮捕，送市人民法院审理。
    南京市人民法院自受理该案后，即从各方面进行调查，证实该儿童院在外籍修女主持下，一贯虐杀中国儿童，仅在一九五零年六月至今年四月的十个月内，又使婴儿一百零一名死亡。目前幸存的五十八名（前误为六十名）儿童全部患营养不良症，其中患结核病者二十一人，患皮肤病者三十三人，身体最坏的儿童患着五种病症。白洁贞等把稍大的孩子当做牛马使唤，罚他们做体力所不能胜任的劳役，任意地打骂、禁锢他们。上述各项事实，白犯等在法庭上一一供认。人民法院乃按该犯等所负责任大小、罪恶轻重及悔过程度，分别予以惩处：白洁贞（法籍）、白安琪（葡萄牙籍）两犯系该院负责人，判处徒刑十年；白淑贞（法籍）、郎雪如（法籍）、于天佑（奥国籍）、爱圣心（波兰籍）等四犯，直接负保育护理儿童责任，不但未善尽职责，而且故意虐待中国儿童，着即永远驱逐出中华人民共和国国境；云南斯（意大利籍）在审讯期间有所悔悟，又念其罪恶较轻，因此从宽处理，予以申斥释放后限期出境。
