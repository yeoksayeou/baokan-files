To the Editor:

I feel that within the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there are countless deeds worthy of praise, and they are worthy of being used as subjects for song creation (such as the immortal Yang Gensi Hero Platoon, Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon, the lone hero Lü Songshan, etc.). However, to date, I have rarely seen a song about singing the people's heroes in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. I hope that music workers can better create songs praising the people's heroes in the future and sing the heroes' deeds in every corner of China! At the same time, it can also overcome the general phenomenon in current lyrics creation.

    让我们来歌唱中国人民志愿军编辑同志：
    我觉得在我国人民志愿军中，有着无数可以歌颂的事迹，值得我们作为歌曲创作的题材（如不朽的杨根思英雄排、郭忠田英雄排，孤胆英雄吕松山等）。可是，迄今为止，我还很少见到有一个歌子是关于歌唱抗美援朝的人民英雄的。希望音乐工作者，今后能更好地创作出歌颂人民英雄的歌子，把英雄们的事迹，唱遍全中国的每个角落！同时，也可以克服目前歌词创作中一般化的现象。
