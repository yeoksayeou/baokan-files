The Largest Swimming Pool in the Country Opens: Beijing Shichahai People's Swimming Pool

Mayor Peng Zhen said: We have turned the dirtiest place into a beautiful place, and the harmful place into a useful place.

The Beijing Shichahai People's Swimming Pool was inaugurated on the afternoon of June 6th. Those attending the opening ceremony included Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen, Deputy Mayor Wu Han, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation, and writer Shu Sheyu, as well as more than 2,300 guests from the government, agencies, and people's organizations.

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the meeting. He said, "In the past, Shichahai was the dirtiest area in Beijing and very harmful to the health of the citizens. Now, we have turned the dirtiest place into the most beautiful place, and the harmful place into the useful place. To eliminate the old things that are harmful to the people and build new things that are beneficial to the people, this is our task. We will reform and develop our capital in this way." Rong Gaotang, Liao Chengzhi, Shu Sheyu and others also spoke successively. Shu Sheyu said in his speech: "Today I see such a beautiful swimming pool, I can't imagine it! I can't imagine what Beijing will become in ten years. I am a Beijinger, how much I love Beijing! The stinky Dragon Beard Ditch is gone! This place used to be a stinky puddle. When I was a child, I often came here to play. What was the situation then? Surrounded by teahouses, in the middle was a dirty and smelly stagnant pool. Many people drank tea in the teahouses, some people took drinking tea as a profession, and could drink all day long, and the bottom was still so smelly! Now, this place has changed, it has become a place for young people to exercise, and people who take drinking tea as a profession are gone. The north side of this swimming pool used to be Juxiantang, where there was a theater building, and many so-called 'dignitaries' sat there watching operas, eating fresh lotus roots, and eating fresh water chestnuts. Now, those 'dignitaries' are also gone. This is not born out of thin air, this is the effect of politics, only the People's Government can do this, the People's Government is to serve the people! Is it a waste to spend some money to build a swimming pool? We can't say that. We want to fight the American devils and build our country, so we must have good health. Now that we have this equipment, we must use this equipment to make our bodies strong."

After the ceremony, swimming competitions, water polo competitions, and diving performances were held.

Note: The construction of the Beijing Shichahai People's Swimming Pool began in August last year and was completed at the end of May this year. After completing the Dragon Beard Ditch renovation project, the Beijing Municipal People's Government vigorously reorganized the city's river and lake system, dredged the Three Seas (Zhongnanhai, Beihai, Shichahai), and listened to the opinions of the general public, using the natural water system and the original terrain to build this swimming pool in the Xixiaohai of the former Shichahai.

The swimming pool is divided into two major areas: the visiting area and the swimming area. The swimming area is divided into: children's pool, shallow pool, competition pool, and deep pool. In addition, there are also sunbathing areas, open-air showers, and green lawns for resting after swimming. The visiting area has a newspaper and magazine supply station and a reading room. The entire area covers 33,500 square meters and can accommodate 4,000 people, making it the largest and most well-equipped swimming pool in the country.

The pool will officially open from the 7th. It will be open twice a day, from 8:30 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon. Evening sessions are also planned for the future. When open, a "physical examination certificate of qualification" issued by the hospital or doctor designated by the venue is required to purchase a swimming ticket. Swimming tickets are divided into several types such as ordinary tickets, visitor tickets, monthly tickets, and seasonal tickets.

　　全国规模最大的游泳场  北京市什刹海人民游泳场揭幕
    彭真市长说：我们把最脏的地方变成了美丽的地方，把有害的地方变成了有用的地方。
    北京市什刹海人民游泳场已于六月六日下午揭幕了。参加揭幕典礼的，有中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻、北京市彭真市长、吴晗副市长、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志、中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志同志、中华全国体育总会筹备委员会副主任荣高棠和作家舒舍予，以及政府、机关、人民团体的观礼来宾二千三百余人。
    彭真市长在会上讲了话。他说：“过去，什刹海这个地方是北京市最脏的地区，是对市民健康很有害的地方。现在，我们把最脏的地方变成最美丽的地方，把有害的地方变成有用的地方。消灭有害人民的旧东西，建设有益人民的新东西，这就是我们的任务。我们将这样来改革与发展我们的首都。”荣高棠、廖承志和舒舍予等也先后讲了话。舒舍予在讲话中说：“我今天看见这么美丽的游泳场，简直不敢想像啦！不敢想像十年以后的北京，要变成什么样儿。我是北京人，我是多么爱北京啊！那么臭的龙须沟没有了！这里，过去也是个臭水坑。我小时候，常到这儿来玩。那时是怎样的情形呢？四面是茶棚，中间是个又脏又臭的死水坑。许多人在茶棚里喝茶，有些人拿喝茶当职业，能喝一整天，而且下边还是那么臭！现在，这个地方变了，变成青年们锻炼身体的地方了，拿喝茶当职业的人没有了。这个游泳场的北面，过去是聚贤堂，那里有戏楼，很多所谓‘达官贵人’，坐在那儿看戏，吃鲜藕，吃鲜菱角。现在，那些‘达官贵人’也没有了。这不是平白无故地生出来的，这是政治作用，这只有人民政府才能做到，人民政府就是为人民服务的嘛！修游泳场，花几个钱能说是浪费吗？不能这么说。我们要打美国鬼子，要建设我们的国家，就要有好身体。我们现在有了这个设备，就要利用这个设备，把身体炼得棒棒的。”
    典礼毕，即举行游泳比赛、水球比赛、跳水表演。
    按：北京市什刹海人民游泳场建设工程开始于去年八月，今年五月底完工。北京市人民政府在完成龙须沟整修工程以后，即大力整理全市河湖水系，疏浚三海（中南海、北海、什刹海），并听取了广大市民的意见，利用天然水系，原来的地形，在前什刹海西小海修建了这个游泳场。
    游泳场分参观区和游泳区两大部分。游泳区分设：儿童池、浅水池、比赛池、深水池。此外，还设有日光浴场、露天淋浴处和供游泳后休憩的绿荫草坪。参观区设有书报供应站、阅览处。全场面积共三万三千五百平方公尺，可容四千人，为全国规模最大、设备较完善的一个游泳场。
    该场自七日起正式开放。每日开放两场，上午八时三十分至十一时三十分，下午一时至六时。以后并准备增加晚场。开放时须有该场指定的医院或医师签发的“体格检查合格证”才能购买游泳券。游泳券分为普通券、参观券、月票、季票等数种。
