　　**North China Branch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association Holds Expanded Standing Committee Meeting**
    **Responding to and Implementing the General Association's Three Major Patriotic Calls**
    **Requiring All Counties and Cities to Convene Resist-America Aid-Korea Representative Conferences as Soon as Possible to Ensure Concrete Implementation**
    [This newspaper reports] The North China Branch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association held an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee on the 8th and 9th, in order to respond to and implement the General Association's "June 1st" call.
    The meeting began with a report by the Chairman of the Association, Comrade Nie Zhen, on implementing the General Association's June 1st call. He first described how the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement after the "May 1st" demonstrations in North China had become widespread and achieved great success: Patriotic Pledges have been quite commonly established in cities and villages. As of the end of May, the total amount of donations had reached 15 billion yuan. After "June 1st", the movement to donate airplanes and artillery is rapidly unfolding across the region. Currently, proposed donations include 52 airplanes, 21 artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns, and one tank. In terms of preferential treatment work, North China has created fixed substitute farming systems and work-point systems. At the same time, it was emphasized that our past work has not been good enough and there are still many shortcomings. Based on the General Association's call, specific instructions for implementing the General Association's call are proposed for discussion and revision. It is hoped that through this meeting, specific methods for implementing the General Association's three major patriotic calls will be discussed, so as to greatly advance the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement in North China in a deeper direction.
    During the discussion, everyone warmly supported the General Association's call and passed Chairman Nie Zhen's report and the proposed instructions for implementing the General Association's call. During the discussion on promoting patriotic pledges, Dong Luan, Jia Xinzhai, Li Leguang, Liu Shaobai, and others, based on the situation and problems of promoting patriotic pledges in five provinces and two cities, unanimously believed that patriotic pledges should be revised and enriched through the movement to donate airplanes and artillery, and preferential treatment work, to overcome the phenomenon of formalism. When promoting patriotic pledges, it is necessary to pay attention to deeply publicizing the significance and role of patriotic pledges; the signing of the pledges should be preceded by full deliberation and democratic discussion, so that they truly become the masses' own program of action. The content of the pledges should be practical and specific, avoiding vagueness or triviality; the implementation of the pledges should be regularly checked, new content should be enriched in a timely manner, and necessary revisions should be made.
    The discussion on donating weapons was extremely enthusiastic. Everyone reflected that after listening to the reports of the returning volunteer representatives, workers, farmers, industrialists, businessmen, and people from all walks of life in various places had spontaneously launched a donation movement. According to Xun Changwu of the North China People's Revolutionary University, the students of the school voluntarily donated cash, materials, houses, and land, worth approximately 1.5 billion yuan, which could buy a fighter jet. Liu Yingyuan, Zhang Zhixiang, Tian Xiujuan, Zhu Jisheng, Liu Shaobai, Jia Xinzhai, Zi Yaohua, Guo Yaoting, Li Chao and others spoke extensively, providing opinions. The meeting extensively studied the different situations in cities, rural areas, mountainous areas, disaster areas, and relatively affluent areas. Based on the masses' high level of patriotism, it was unanimously agreed that a surge in the donation movement should be launched and publicity work should be done well to complete the General Association's task of increasing production and donations. However, the donation movement must implement the principles of proceeding from reality, and being conscious and voluntary.
    During the discussion on preferential treatment work, Zi Yaohua, Zhang Zhixiang, Bai Jian, and others successively provided many problems and experiences. Everyone unanimously believed that the Volunteer Army is fighting bloody battles on the front lines, and we should do a good job in preferential treatment and substitute farming work in the rear. Through the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement, we should highly promote the masses' love for the motherland and the people's army, and launch regular movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. We must also strengthen the importance and inspection of preferential treatment work by leaders at all levels, and promote the experience of fixed substitute farming systems and work-point systems. We must earnestly solve the difficulties in employment and schooling for the families of martyrs and soldiers.
    Zhang Minghe, the head of the 5th sub-group of the comfort delegation to Korea (North China delegation), reported to the meeting on their work. The delegation will travel to various provinces and cities in North China in the coming days to report to the broad masses about the heroic deeds of the People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front and the expectations of the soldiers on the front lines for the people of the motherland.
    Finally, the meeting proposed: All counties and cities should convene Resist-America Aid-Korea representative conferences as soon as possible, vigorously implement the General Association's call, and vigorously launch the donation movement in the entire region.

　　华北抗美援朝总分会举行扩大常委会        
    响应与执行总会三大爱国号召
    要求各县市尽快召开抗美援朝代表会保证具体实现
    【本报讯】华北抗美援朝总分会，为响应和贯彻总会“六一”号召，于八、九两日举行了扩大的常务委员会议。
    会议首由该会主席聂真同志作了关于贯彻总会六一号召的报告。他首先叙述了华北各地“五一”示威后的抗美援朝运动已经普及起来，已取得伟大成就：爱国公约在城市中、农村中已相当普遍地订立，截至五月底止，捐献总额已达一百五十亿元。而在“六一”后，各地捐献飞机大炮运动正迅速展开。目前各地提出捐献的飞机已达五十二架，大炮、高射炮二十一门，坦克一辆。在优抚工作方面，华北创造了固定代耕制，工票制等办法。同时，又强调指出：我们过去的工作还作的不够，还有很多缺点，根据总会的号召，特提出贯彻执行总会号召的指示，请讨论修正。希望经过此次会议讨论出具体执行总会三大爱国号召的办法，把华北抗美援朝运动向深入方面大大推进一步。
    在讨论中大家热烈拥护总会号召并通过了聂真主席的报告及所提出的贯彻总会号召的指示。在讨论具体推行爱国公约时，董鲁安、贾心斋、李乐光、刘少白等，根据五省二市推行爱国公约的情况和问题，一致认为应通过捐献飞机大炮运动和优抚工作来修订充实爱国公约，克服形式主义的现象。在推行爱国公约时必须注意深入宣传爱国公约的意义和作用；订约时要经过充分的酝酿和民主讨论，使其真正成为群众自己的行动纲领。公约内容要切实具体，避免空泛或琐碎；要定期检查执行公约的情形，适时充实新内容并作必要的修正。
    捐献武器的讨论极为热烈。大家纷纷反映各地工人、农民、工商界以及各界人民，在听了志愿军归国代表报告后，已自发地掀起了捐献运动。仅据华北人民革命大学荀昌五在会上谈，该校学员自动捐献现金、物资、房屋、地皮，约值十五亿元，当可买一架战斗机。刘英源、张致祥、田秀娟、朱继圣、刘少白、贾心斋、资耀华、郭耀挺、李超等普遍发言，提供意见。会议广泛地研究了城市、农村、山区、灾区及较富庶区的不同情况，根据群众高度的爱国热忱，一致认为要掀起捐献运动的热潮并做好宣传工作，完成总会增产捐献号召的任务。但捐献运动必须贯彻从实际出发、自觉自愿原则。
    讨论优抚工作时，资耀华、张致祥、白坚等先后提供了好多问题和经验。大家一致认为志愿军在前线浴血抗战，我们在后方应将优抚代耕工作作好。应通过抗美援朝运动，高度发扬群众对祖国对人民军队的热爱，发动群众经常的拥军优属运动。并须加强各级领导对优抚工作的重视和检查，推广固定代耕制、工票制的经验。要切实解决烈属军属就业、就学的困难。
    赴朝慰问团第五分团（华北区代表团）长张明河同志向会议报告了工作。该团日内分赴华北各省市向广大人民报告朝鲜前线人民志愿军英雄事迹及前方将士对祖国人民的期望。
    最后，会议提出：各县市应尽快召开抗美援朝代表会议，大力贯彻总会号召，将全区的捐献运动大力地开展起来。
