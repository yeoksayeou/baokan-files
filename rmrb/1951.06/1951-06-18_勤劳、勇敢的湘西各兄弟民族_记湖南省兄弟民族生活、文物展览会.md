The Hunan Province Brotherly Ethnic Groups’ Life and Cultural Relics Exhibition, held in Changsha from May 29th to June 6th, was a highly educational lesson for the masses. Through numerous authentic pictures, texts, and objects, it concretely showed every visitor that the brotherly ethnic groups of Western Hunan are diligent, brave, and intelligent, just like other brotherly ethnic groups in the country. It powerfully exposed the slanderous propaganda about ethnic minorities spread by the reactionary rulers of past generations and corrected many people's incorrect perceptions of these brotherly ethnic groups, such as "barbaric," "ignorant," and "backward." It also made it clearer to everyone how the reactionary ruling classes of past generations persecuted and discriminated against these groups, and how the Communist Party and the People's Government respect and help them today. This further deepened everyone's understanding of the crimes of the reactionary rulers and gave them a personal feeling that the People's Republic of China is indeed a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups.

When you see the first part of the exhibition, every exhibit will naturally convince you of the diligence and wisdom of the brotherly ethnic groups. "The officials live in mansions, the guests [Note 1] live on slopes, driving my Miao people to the mountain valleys." The ethnic oppression policies of the reactionary rulers of past generations forced the brotherly ethnic groups to live in barren mountains and deep valleys for a long time. They relied on their own hands to fight stubbornly against nature and create their new lives. Look at the terraced fields on the high mountains, one after another, which cannot be plowed by oxen and must be dug entirely by hand. On the steep "hanging soil" [Note 2], people cling to tree branches with one hand and wield hoes with the other, diligently turning the soil. There are also the tall waterwheels installed by the streams, which lift water level by level into the terraced fields, irrigating the dry land on the high mountains. In this way, they relied on their hard work to develop "good places on the Wanrong River [Note 3], with terraced fields like the pages of a book." How can we not admire them?

In many photos, we can see that the architecture of the brotherly ethnic groups is highly creative. The five-story wooden pagoda outside Tongdao City and the wind and rain bridge more than ten zhang high in Qiancheng County are such beautiful buildings! They are not only very rich in ethnic characteristics but also extremely exquisite and solid. Dozens of exquisite handicrafts, such as the beautiful floral belts woven by women, various delicate silver ornaments, and the Lusheng, China's most ancient harmonic instrument, also demonstrate their excellent skills and wisdom. In terms of dance, they also have a high degree of artistry. For example, the eight-person swing, monkey drum, and high-climbing skills all express their healthy and simple ethnicity. Especially from the high-climbing skills, we can clearly see their heroic character. Even more valuable is that they have preserved China's oldest dance, the "drum dance." This dance has long been lost among the Han people. How can we not admire these exquisite handicrafts, magnificent buildings, and excellent ethnic arts?!

In the second part of the exhibition, we can see various pieces of evidence of the ethnic oppression carried out by the reactionary rulers of past generations. The "Guoshan List" [Note 4] of the Song Dynasty, after driving the brotherly ethnic groups from the plains to the high mountains, shamelessly deceived and fooled them. The Ming Dynasty built a "Great Wall of the Interior" in western Hunan, which was 360 li long, to cruelly suppress the resistance struggles of the Miao compatriots. The Qing Dynasty implemented the "military agricultural colonization" policy, confiscating the land that the Miao compatriots had cultivated diligently for generations. From the first year of "Jiaqing" to the twelfth year alone, more than 130,000 mu of Miao land were confiscated! The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang intensified the exploitation and oppression of the brotherly ethnic groups: in 1937, under the name of "abolishing military agricultural colonization and increasing taxes," they carried out a frenzied plunder. At that time, the Miao compatriots in Yongshui bore as many as 53 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. Coupled with the rampant bandits, the devaluation of counterfeit currency, and the forced conscription by the puppet government, the brotherly ethnic groups were left with broken families and no food or clothing. "Last year, there were many wives, this year there is much paper money [Note 5], next year we will sing a song of peace," vividly exposing the dark situation and expressing the brotherly ethnic groups' urgent desire for liberation.

The brotherly ethnic groups are brave, and they have never been willing to succumb to any unjust and barbaric behavior. They have launched countless heroic and moving struggles to resist the oppression of the reactionary rulers of past generations. In 1794, the Miao compatriots in Hunan and Guizhou launched a heroic struggle, fighting with more than 100,000 "government troops" of the Qing Dynasty for three years. From 1935 to 1937, the Miao compatriots in western Hunan held the famous "Get rid of Military Agricultural Colonization Movement" to resist the "Military Agricultural Colonization rent" of the Chiang bandit gang. In 1942, the flames of the "Ma Wang Incident," a struggle against the Kuomintang's conscription of soldiers and grain, were ignited. Although all these heroic struggles were subjected to the cruel suppression of the reactionary rulers and failed on the surface, their brilliance will forever illuminate the path of the brotherly ethnic groups. They have written an extremely splendid page in the history of the Chinese nation's revolutionary struggle.

After the liberation of Hunan, the People's Liberation Army eliminated the historical bandits of western Hunan in just one year. Since then, the sinful rule of the reactionaries has been eradicated forever, and the big stone that had weighed on the heads of the brotherly ethnic groups for thousands of years has been moved away and shattered forever. The brilliance of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy shines on the brotherly ethnic groups! For the first time, they truly stood up and enjoyed equal treatment with other brotherly ethnic groups. The Miao compatriots in Yongshui have such a folk song: "The golden rooster raises its head to drink water, millions of Liberation Army soldiers come, the evil ghosts and reactionaries are all overthrown, the sun shines into the Miao mountain stockade; everyone says Chairman Mao is good, and the Liberation Army is well-behaved in thousands of miles." This folk song enthusiastically sings their joy after being liberated! In the year or so since liberation, with the help of the People's Government, they have made significant improvements in politics, economy, culture, and life. The Tongdao County Ethnic Democratic Joint Government was established, and the county magistrate is Yi compatriot Su Changfu. The deputy county magistrate of Fenghuang is Miao compatriot Long Zaiyu. Up to now, 291 cadres from the brotherly ethnic groups have been promoted. Representatives of the brotherly ethnic groups also participate in people's representative conferences at all levels. Schools in various places have also absorbed many young people from the brotherly ethnic groups. In individual areas, such as Tongdao County, there are also schools for the brotherly ethnic groups. In terms of trade, state-owned trading companies have gone deep into the countryside and actively supplied the brotherly ethnic groups with various necessities of life. According to statistics from Yongshun, Qiancheng, Fenghuang, and Guzhang counties, from April to December of last year, 1.03 million jin of salt were supplied. The brotherly ethnic groups no longer had to endure the life of licking "salt bags." Seven thousand bolts of cloth were supplied. The predicament of "three years new, three years old, patching and mending for another three years" is also over forever. The trading companies also purchased a large amount of local products. During the same period mentioned above, 1.06 million jin of tung oil and 40,000 jin of gallnuts were purchased, solving the problem of unsalable local products that had never been solved before and bringing a prosperous life to the brotherly ethnic groups. "The reactionaries drove the Miao people out, and Chairman Mao brought us home; Chairman Mao leads us like a star, and our ethnic groups unite and move forward!" This song fully expresses the difference between the two worlds and also expresses their love for Chairman Mao. "Always follow Chairman Mao, as clear as spring water, as bright and shiny as pearls," which further illustrates their strong will.

Then, from the photos in the exhibition, we can see that the visiting group of the Central South Military and Political Committee came to western Hunan, bringing Chairman Mao's love and the Han people's love and respect for the brotherly ethnic groups.

After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the brotherly ethnic groups also launched a wave of production to strive for a bumper harvest as a practical action to resist America and aid Korea. "Yangque chirps early on the third day of Qingming, everyone goes to the mountains to plant corn, a good harvest to aid Korea, aid the Korean army to resist the American army" and "Put on short knives, blow the bugle, rise up to protect the country, resist America and aid Korea" two folk songs, more to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea.

This exhibition strengthened the unity between ethnic groups. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, in the big family of ethnic friendship and cooperation, all ethnic groups will forever unite, fight, and move forward.

(Note 1) The brotherly ethnic groups in western Hunan call the Han people "guests."
(Note 2) The soil on the steep slope is like a shop sign, hence the name.
(Note 3) A small river in western Hunan.
(Note 4) According to legend, the ancestor of the Yao ethnic group, "Panhu," helped the Song Dynasty "Emperor Ping" kill "King Gao" during the Song Dynasty. In order to "reward" him, the Song Emperor enfeoffed him as "King" and established the "Guoshan List," "allowing" his descendants to reclaim land in the mountains of the border area and "exempting" them from taxes. In reality, it deprived the Yao ethnic group of the right to cultivate land on the plains.
(Note 5) The reactionaries conscripted many young people from ethnic minorities, leaving behind only women, so it is said that there are many wives; counterfeit currency devalues and becomes useless in the blink of an eye, so it is said that there is much paper money.

　　勤劳、勇敢的湘西各兄弟民族
    ——记湖南省兄弟民族生活、文物展览会
　　刘城淮　孙上元
    五月二十九日至六月六日在长沙举行的湖南省兄弟民族生活、文物展览会，对群众是一堂富有教育意义的大课。它以许多真实的图片、文字和物品，很具体地告诉每一个观众：湘西兄弟民族是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的，正跟国内其他兄弟民族一样。它有力地揭露了历代反动统治者关于少数民族的污蔑宣传，纠正了许多人对兄弟民族某些不正确的看法，如“野蛮”、“愚昧”、“落后”等。它也让大家更清楚地知道：历代反动统治阶级是怎样迫害和歧视兄弟民族的，而今天共产党、人民政府又是怎样尊重和帮助他们的；因而使大家进一步认识到历代反动统治者的罪恶，并亲切地感觉到：中华人民共和国的确是各民族友爱合作的大家庭。
    当你见到展览会的第一部分时，每一件展览品都会叫你自然而然地信服兄弟民族的勤劳和智慧。“官居坪，客（注一）居坡，赶我苗家上山窝”，历代反动统治者的民族压迫政策，逼得兄弟民族长期住在贫瘠的崇山深谷里。他们靠双手顽强地与大自然作斗争，创造出自己的新生活。你看：那高山上层层叠叠一丘一丘的梯田，不能够用牛耕，完全要用人工下力挖；在那陡峭的“挂牌土”（注二）上，人们一只手攀着树枝，一只手挥锄，辛勤地翻着土；还有那装置在溪边的高大的水车，把水一级级地打到梯田里去，灌溉着高山上的旱田。就是这样，他们凭着自己辛勤的劳动，开辟出“万榕江（注三）上好地方，丘丘田土书页样”，怎能不叫我们敬佩呢！
    在许多照片上，我们可以看出：兄弟民族的建筑，是有高度的创造性的。像通道城外的五层木塔，乾城县十多丈高的风雨桥，是多么漂亮的建筑！不但非常富于民族色彩也十分的精巧、坚固。几十件精巧的手工艺品，如妇女们织的美丽的花带，各种玲珑的银首饰，中国最古的和声乐器芦笙等，同样表现了他们高明的技艺和智慧。在舞蹈方面，他们也具有很高的艺术性。比如八人秋千、猴儿鼓、登高术等，莫不表现了他们的健康、纯朴的民族性。特别从登高术上，可以很明显地窥见他们的英勇性格；而更值得可贵的，他们还保存了中国最古的舞蹈“鼓舞”。这种舞在汉民族中却早已失传了。这些精巧的工艺品、伟大的建筑和优良的民族艺术，又怎能不叫我们赞叹呢？！
    在展览会的第二部分，我们可以看到历代反动统治者们施行民族压迫的各种罪证。宋朝的“过山榜”（注四），在把兄弟民族从平地赶上了高山后，还加以无耻的欺蒙和愚弄；明代皇朝在湘西修筑了一条长达三百六十里的“内地长城”，残酷地镇压苗胞的反抗斗争。清朝各代更实行“屯田”政策，没收苗胞世代勤劳开垦出来的土地。光只“嘉庆”元年到十二年被没收的苗胞土地竟达十三万多亩！蒋介石匪帮更是变本加厉地剥削、压迫兄弟民族：一九三七年以“废屯升科”的名义，对他们实行疯狂的掠夺。当时永绥苗胞负担的苛捐杂税竟达五十三种之多。加以土匪横行，伪币贬值，伪政府又强行抓丁拉伕，弄得兄弟民族妻离子散，衣食无着。“去年婆娘多，今年纸洋多（注五），明年唱个太平歌”，鲜明地暴露出了那种黑暗的情况，也道出了兄弟民族迫切要求解放的心情。
    兄弟民族是勇敢的，他们从来就不甘心向一切非正义的、野蛮的行为屈服。他们曾掀起了无数次可歌可泣的斗争，去反抗历代反动统治者的压迫。一七九四年，湘黔苗胞发起了壮烈的斗争，曾与清朝十多万“官兵”搏战达三年之久。一九三五年至一九三七年，湘西苗胞为反抗蒋匪帮的“屯租”，举行了著名的“革屯运动”。一九四二年，燃起了反抗国民党征兵征粮的“麻王事件”的斗争火焰。这一切英勇的斗争，虽然遭受到反动统治者们残酷的镇压，在表面上失败了，但是它们的光辉却永远照亮着兄弟民族的道路。在中国民族的革命斗争史上，写下了极其灿烂的一页。
    湖南解放后，人民解放军又在短短的一年内，铲除了湘西的历史性的土匪。从此，反动派的罪恶统治永远地被根绝了，千百年压在兄弟民族头上的大石块，永远地被搬走了、粉碎了；毛主席的民族政策的光芒，照到了兄弟民族的身上！他们第一次真正地站了起来，和其他兄弟民族一道，享受了民族平等的待遇。永绥苗胞有这样一首山歌：“金鸡喝水把头抬，百万解放军开过来，恶鬼反动派都打倒，太阳照进苗山砦；人人都说毛主席好，千里传言解放军乖。”这山歌热情地唱出了他们翻身后的愉快！在解放后一年多来，他们在人民政府的帮助下，在政治、经济、文化和生活等方面，都有了显著的改进。通道县成立了民族民主联合政府、县长是彝胞粟昌福同志，凤凰的副县长是苗胞龙再宇同志。到现在为止，已提拔了兄弟民族干部二百九十一人。各级人民代表会议也都有兄弟民族参加。各地的学校也吸收了许多兄弟民族的青年，个别地区如通道县，还有了兄弟民族的学校。贸易方面，国营贸易公司更是深入农村，主动地供给兄弟民族各种生活必需品。据永顺、乾城、凤凰、古丈四县统计，从去年四月到十二月，曾供给盐一百零三万斤，兄弟民族过去呧“盐包”的生活，再也没有了；供给布七千匹，“新三年，旧三年，补补缀缀又三年”的窘境，也永远过去了。贸易公司同时又大量地收购土产。在上述同一期间内，收购了桐油一百零六万斤，五倍子四万斤等，解决了从来没有解决过的土产滞销问题，给兄弟民族带来了富裕的生活。“反动派把苗家撵出门去，毛主席把我们接回家来；毛主席像天星一样领导我们走路，我们各民族团结向前！”这歌声，一方面充分地表现出两个世界的不同，也道出了他们对毛主席的热爱。“永远跟着毛主席，像泉水一样清清楚楚，像珍珠一样亮亮晶晶”，更说明了他们的坚强意志。
    接着，我们从展览的照片上可以看到：中南军政委员会访问团到了湘西，带去了毛主席的慈爱，和汉民族热爱、尊敬兄弟民族的心情。
    抗美援朝运动开展后，兄弟民族同样掀起了生产热潮，以争取丰收作为抗美援朝的实际行动。“清明三早阳雀啾，大家上山种包谷，丰收好去援朝鲜，援助朝鲜抗美军”和“背上短刀，吹起军号，起来保家卫国，抗美援朝”两首民歌，更表现了他们抗美援朝的决心。
    这次展览会，加强了民族间的团结。今后，各民族在毛主席、共产党的领导下，在友爱、合作的民族大家庭中，将永远团结、战斗、向前。
    （注一）湘西兄弟民族称汉族为客家。
    （注二）峻坡上的墦土，像商店的招牌一样，故名。
    （注三）湘西一条小河名。
    （注四）相传徭族的祖先“盘护”，在宋朝时帮助宋室“平王”杀死了“高王”，宋皇为了“酬劳”他，封他为“王”立下“过山榜”，“准许”他的子孙在边区山中开垦，并“免征”赋税。实际上就是剥夺了徭族在平地耕种的权利。
    （注五）反动派征兵抓走了许多少数民族的青年，家中留下的皆是妇女，故说婆娘多；伪币贬值，转眼无用，所以说是纸洋多。
