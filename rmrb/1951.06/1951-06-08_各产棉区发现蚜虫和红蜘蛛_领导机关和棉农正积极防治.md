Aphids and Spider Mites Discovered in Cotton-Producing Areas; Leading Organs and Cotton Farmers are Actively Preventing and Controlling Them
    Currently, cotton seedlings are emerging successively in various regions, and pests such as aphids and spider mites have also appeared one after another. In mid- and late-May, aphids were discovered in Linzhang, Handan, Gucheng, Wuji, Jin County, She County, and Xing Tang counties in Hebei Province. The first cotton fields to discover aphids were those near graves, roadsides, and fields with more weeds. In Pingyuan Province, aphids have also generally occurred in more than ten counties including Liaocheng, Dong'a, Tangyi, Gaotang, Boping, Chiping, Jiyuan, Meng County, Wuzhi, and Xinxiang, and are continuing to spread. In Tangyin County Farm, aphids appeared seven days after the cotton seedlings emerged. Aphids have been found in 30% of the cotton seedlings at Lin County Farm. In the eastern suburbs of Beijing, aphids and spider mites appeared on the cotyledons less than ten days after the cotton seedlings emerged. Aphids and spider mites have also occurred in Liaoxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi.
    The summer harvest and summer planting season every year is the period when aphids and spider mites are most harmful. Based on this experience, leading organs and farmers in some regions have already made arrangements and preparations for both prevention and control. In Hebei Province, Baoding, Tong County, Shijiazhuang and other regions have launched weed removal and aphid prevention work in the drought resistance and cotton planting campaign, and have prepared a large number of insecticidal drugs and machinery. Shijiazhuang City is currently continuing to mobilize the masses to remove weeds and prevent aphids, while calling on the masses to thoroughly eliminate cotton aphids when carrying out the first cotton thinning. In order to strengthen the preparation for the prevention and control of cotton aphids and spider mites, Huimin Prefecture in Shandong Province, in addition to actively purchasing and preparing medicines and machinery, has also organized technical experts and technical cadres from relevant units to form an aphid control team as a technical guidance organization for aphid control in the entire prefecture. At the same time, a training session on the prevention and control of cotton aphids and spider mites was held for county farms and county and district production cadres to enhance cadres' confidence in preventing and controlling pests. It also promptly organized cadres to go to various counties to help run training classes for preventing and controlling cotton insects.

　　各产棉区发现蚜虫和红蜘蛛  领导机关和棉农正积极防治
    目前各地棉苗陆续出土，蚜虫、红蜘蛛等害虫也相继发生，五月中、下旬，河北省临漳、邯郸、故城、无极、晋县、涉县、行唐等县均发现棉蚜。最先发现蚜虫的，均系靠近坟地、道边及杂草较多的棉田。平原省聊城、东阿、堂邑、高唐、博平、茌平、济源、孟县、武陟、新乡等十余县，也普遍发生棉蚜，并在继续蔓延中。汤阴县农场的棉花出苗七天，就发生了蚜虫。林县农场棉田已有十分之三的棉苗发现蚜虫。北京东郊棉苗出土不到十天，在子叶上即发生蚜虫和红蜘蛛。辽西、山东、山西、河南、陕西各地也同样的发生了蚜虫和红蜘蛛。
    历年夏收夏种时期，正是蚜虫和红蜘蛛为害最严重的阶段。若干地区领导机关和农民根据这一经验，已作了防治兼施的布署和准备。河北省保定、通县、石家庄等专区在抗旱植棉运动中，开展了除草防蚜工作，并准备了大量的治虫药械。石家庄市目前一面继续发动群众除草防蚜，一面号召群众在进行棉花第一次间苗时彻底消灭棉蚜。山东惠民专区为加强防治棉蚜及红蜘蛛的准备工作，除积极购备药械外，并组织有关单位的技术专家和技术干部成立了治蚜小组，作为全专区防治蚜虫的技术指导机构。同时召集县农场及县区生产干部举行防治棉蚜、红蜘蛛讲习会，以提高干部防治害虫的信心。并及时组织干部分赴各县，帮助办好防治棉虫训练班。
