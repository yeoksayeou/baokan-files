　　Light Cavalry Teams Conducting Propaganda Work in Broad Rural Areas
　　——Cultural Propaganda Groups in Various Counties of Shanxi
　　Ruan Zhangjing
    In order to boost the political and production enthusiasm of the broad masses in rural areas, conduct patriotic ideological education, and disseminate cultural and scientific knowledge, various counties in Shanxi Province have established cultural propaganda groups. Since the first batch of students from the Provincial Department of Culture and Education's Art Training Class graduated last July, counties have successively established these groups. According to statistics at the first Literary and News Awards Conference in February of this year, all 92 counties in the province, except for Wuxiang, Qinyuan, Pingding, Shilou, Jiaocheng, and Hequ, had established cultural propaganda groups. Most of the cultural propaganda groups are composed primarily of graduates from art training classes, supplemented by members drawn from county opera troupes, teachers, students, and intellectuals in the countryside. Each group has a maximum of more than ten members and a minimum of two or three. A total of 660 people participated in propaganda groups throughout the province (materials from Daning and Yonghe counties are missing).
    The main task of the cultural propaganda groups is to regularly combine with central tasks, using various forms of cultural arts for propaganda. For example: storytelling with drums, quick clapper talks, projecting lantern slides, and showing foreign films; carrying popular reading materials, picture books, and cartoons to the countryside, etc. They also adopted written and artistic propaganda methods such as setting up cultural sheds, painting murals, writing slogans, distributing small leaflets, and publishing mass blackboard newspapers. The cultural propaganda groups also assisted rural opera troupes, blind propaganda teams, or schools in teaching songs, dances, and rehearsing plays; and, according to needs and possibilities, organized rural opera troupes and folk artists to observe, compete, or hold forums, reform the ideology of old artists, adapt old scripts, and reform the old opera troupe system, etc. In the past six months (from July last year to February this year), the cultural propaganda groups, in conjunction with autumn production, winter study movements, peace signatures, Spring Festival propaganda, anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic ideological education, and other work, have made preliminary achievements:
    I. The cultural and recreational activities of rural opera troupes in various counties are mostly spontaneous and seasonal. The enthusiasm of the participants is very high, but they lack specialized guidance and cannot improve well. The establishment of cultural propaganda groups has been of great help to them. For example, the Linxian Cultural Propaganda Group, in a very short time, helped more than 20 rural opera troupes rehearse plays and write scripts, taught students in two complete primary schools to perform "Da Bawang Bian" (Fighting Overlord Whip dance), and organized a waist drum team in a civil school. In order to do a good job in this year's Spring Festival cultural activities, a joint meeting of umbrella leaders (those who lead folk entertainment activities) and leaders of opera troupes, Taoist tune bands, blind propaganda teams, painters, and other folk artists was held last December to exchange experiences, discuss and arrange this year's propaganda work. In terms of reforming old dramas, a meeting of the heads of historical opera troupes in the county was held to discuss drama reform policies, summarize experiences, and formulate future work plans.
    II. The best activity mode of the cultural propaganda group is the Huguan Cultural Propaganda Group. They first selected several key villages, went down separately to visit village cadres and the masses, collected the problems that needed to be solved locally and the ideological situation of the masses, and used real people and real things to make lantern slides or compile them into quick clapper talks, drum lyrics, etc., to conduct propaganda using temple fairs or gatherings. They used cultural sheds, painting exhibitions, etc. during the day and lantern slide shows at night. The combination of centralized and decentralized activities was very good. The Qingyuan Cultural Propaganda Group created dramas such as "Great Production," "So Are American Soldiers," and "Ascension Shoes." After watching, the masses said that these were more interesting than the old yangge (a popular rural folk dance).

    From these activities, the following experiences have been gained:
    I. It is necessary to grasp policies and cooperate with central tasks; the content of propaganda must be closely integrated with the ideological situation of the masses. For example, when the Linxian Cultural Propaganda Group cooperated with the mule and horse fair in Qikou Village last year, it happened to be a drought, and a Yiguandao follower was spreading rumors. People in the village worshiped gods and prayed for rain, and also bought a pig to sacrifice to the gods. Some farmers ran away after hearing the rumors. After learning about these situations, the Cultural Propaganda Group used various forms of propaganda at the mule and horse fair and organized forums among the masses. After two days, the masses accepted the idea that sacrificing to gods for rain was useless. Just then, it rained that evening, and the masses became even more convinced of what the propaganda group said. The propaganda group seized the opportunity to expose a large number of Yiguandao's rumors and conspiracies. Since then, the ghost stories of praying for rain have never been heard again in the Qikou area. Therefore, in order to make propaganda in-depth and solve problems, it is necessary to grasp the actual situation of the masses at any time and "prescribe the right medicine."
    II. Propaganda forms should be diverse, there should be frequent new creations, and full use should be made of folk art forms. For example, the Jincheng Cultural Propaganda Group's lantern slide shows are no longer the same old routine. They sing or cooperate with musical instruments according to certain content. For example, when projecting a portrait of Chairman Mao, they play "The East is Red," and when the army passes by, they play "The People's Liberation Army March"; they also coordinate various effects according to certain pictures, such as car horns, gunshots, and horseshoes, making the images on the screen more real and vivid. There are also combined lantern slides and shadow puppets (using paintings as a background, and then using threads to hang the cut characters, which move in front of the paintings). It is also very effective to use lantern slides to teach songs, teaching and singing while projecting the lyrics. Waist drums have also added lyrics and coordinated with more musical instruments. According to the content of the song, various dance postures were created, such as marching to kill the enemy, hoeing the ground, and harvesting. These reforms of literary and art forms have been warmly welcomed by the masses. The Lucheng Cultural Propaganda Group transformed the old magic tricks and gave them new content, such as "Eight Treasure Box" changed to "Liu Jubao's (model worker) Small Farm." Many excellent varieties (cotton, millet, eight-petal garlic, etc.) cultivated by Liu Jubao and improved agricultural tools (hollow hoe, etc.) appeared from the empty box. There is also a comparison between the seeds that have not been soaked and the fruits produced by the soaked seeds. The performance is accompanied by a quick clapper talk to explain, so as to improve agricultural technology.
    III. The cultural propaganda group should not only take the lead in working actively, but also organize or cooperate with various cultural and recreational institutions, use various literary and art forms, and carry out propaganda activities together with other relevant departments. There are many art forms with a mass base in rural areas, such as blind propaganda teams, bayin societies, and amateur bands. Attention should be paid to research, appropriately transform them, and organize them to engage in propaganda activities to give play to their role. The Fenyang Cultural Propaganda Group cooperated with rural opera troupes to perform because there were many rural opera troupes in the local area and they had a certain mass base. This can also transform and improve rural opera troupes, and educate them to accept new things.

    Cooperate with other relevant departments to carry out propaganda, such as cooperating with the Public Security Bureau to publicize the crimes of Yiguandao. Arrange the criminal activities of Yiguandao into a play, and reveal the true face of Yiguandao through real-life performances. After the performance, many people complained and asked to withdraw from the Tao. The Yishi Cultural Propaganda Group cooperated with the agricultural department to promote "warm water seed soaking." Comrades in charge of agricultural improvement and promotion first explained, and the cultural propaganda group used lantern slides, quick clapper talks, and other forms to promote the advantages and methods of "warm water seed soaking." Then the comrades who improved and promoted agriculture helped the masses to carry out field experiments. The same was done in terms of hygiene, and the effects were very good.
    IV. In terms of creation, not only should we work hard ourselves, but also mobilize and organize the masses to create. This year's Spring Festival produced many good works from the masses, with more than 200 new creations in Wenxi County alone. The creation in Xiyang, Wuxiang and other counties have improved in both quantity and quality. This shows that as long as someone in the county pays attention to the creation of the masses, the masses will provide a lot of materials, increasing the propaganda weapons of the cultural propaganda group.

    The cultural propaganda groups in various counties of Shanxi, in the manner of light cavalry teams, are active in the vast rural areas, carrying out cultural education and propaganda work, and have made good achievements. At the same time, the guidance work of the rural mass art popularization movement has been solved, so that the vast laboring people far from the towns and cities can enjoy cultural life, which they demand in the enthusiastic production movement, and have political and ideological guidance and healthy content.

　　向广大农村开展宣传工作的轻骑队      
    ——山西各县的文化宣传小组
    阮章竞
    山西省各县为了提高广大农村群众的政治、生产热情，进行爱国主义思想教育，传播文化科学知识，建立了文化宣传小组。从去年七月省文教厅艺术训练班第一期学员训练完毕之后，各县就开始陆续建立这种小组。到今年二月首届文艺新闻给奖大会时统计，全省九十二县除武乡、沁源、平定、石楼、交城、河曲六县外，都先后建立了文化宣传小组。各地文化宣传小组，大部是以艺术训练班学员为主，又抽调县剧团、教员、学生、在乡知识分子组成的。每个小组最多的十人以上，最少的二、三人。全省参加宣传小组的有六百六十人（缺大宁、永和两县材料）。
    文化宣传小组主要的任务是经常结合中心工作，利用各种各样的文化艺术形式进行宣传。如：说鼓书、快板、放映幻灯、洋片；携带通俗读物、小人书、漫画下乡等。还采用了设立文化棚、画壁画、写标语、散发小型传单、出大众黑板报等文字的和美术的宣传方式。文化宣传小组还帮助农村剧团、盲人宣传队或学校，教歌、教舞、排戏；并根据需要与可能，组织农村剧团与民间艺人观摩、竞赛或举行座谈会，改造旧艺人思想，改编旧剧本，改革旧戏班的制度等。半年（从去年七月到今年二月）以来，文化宣传小组结合了秋季生产、冬学运动、和平签名、春节宣传、抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育等工作，做出了初步的成绩：
    一、各县农村剧团的文化娱乐活动多数是自发的、季节性的。参加活动的人热情很高，但缺乏专人指导，不能很好提高。文化宣传组建立之后，对他们有很大帮助。如临县的文化宣传组，在很短的时间里，帮助了二十多个农村剧团排戏、编剧本，教会两个完全小学的学生“打霸王鞭”，一个民校组织了腰鼓队。为了做好今年春节文娱活动，去年十二月召开了伞头（民间娱乐活动中带头的人）和剧团、道情班的负责人，及盲人宣传队、画匠及其他民间艺人的联席会，交流经验，讨论和布置了今年春节的宣传工作。改革旧剧方面，召开了全县历史剧团的负责人会议，讨论了戏剧改革政策，总结了经验，订出了今后的工作计划。
    二、文化宣传组的活动方式最好的是壶关文化宣传组。他们先选好几个重点村，分头下去向村干和群众进行访问，搜集当地需要解决的问题和群众的思想情况，用真人真事，画成幻灯片，或编成快板、鼓词等，利用庙会或集会进行宣传。白天用文化棚、画展等方式，晚上用幻灯放映。集中与分散活动结合得很好。清源文化宣传组自己创作了《大生产》、《如此美国兵》、《登云鞋》等剧。群众看后都说这比旧秧歌有意思。
    由这些活动中，得到几点经验：
    一、要掌握政策，配合中心工作；宣传内容要紧紧地和群众的思想情况相结合。如临县文化宣传组，去年在碛口村配合骡马大会进行宣传时，正赶上天旱，又有一贯道在造谣。村里祭神求雨，还买了一口猪献神。有些农民听了谣言便偷跑了。文化宣传小组知道了这些情况，就在骡马大会上，利用各种形式做宣传，在群众中组织座谈。经过两天，群众接受了献神求雨不顶事的道理。恰好当天晚上下了一场雨，群众愈发相信宣传组的话了。宣传组就抓紧机会，大量揭露一贯道的造谣阴谋。从此碛口一带求雨的鬼话再也听不到了。因此，要使宣传深入，解决问题，必须随时掌握群众的实际情况，“对症下药”。
    二、宣传形式要多种多样，要时常有新创作，并充分利用民间的艺术形式。如晋城文化宣传组，幻灯放映已不是老一套。他们根据一定的内容说唱或配合乐器。如放映毛主席像时奏“东方红”，过军队时奏“解放军进行曲”；还按照一定的画面配合各种效果，如汽车喇叭、枪响、马蹄声等，使得银幕上的形象更加真实生动。还有利用幻灯和皮影戏（以画片为背景，再把剪好的人物拿线吊着，在画片前活动）结合放映。利用幻灯教歌，一面教唱，一面放映歌词，效果也很好。腰鼓也加了唱词，配合了更多的乐器。根据歌的内容，创作了各种舞姿，如进军杀敌、锄地、收割等。这些文艺形式的改造，都受到群众的热烈欢迎。潞城文化宣传组把旧魔术加以改造，给以新内容，如“八宝箱”改为“刘聚宝（劳动模范）的小农场”。从空箱子里变出刘聚宝培养的许多优良品种（棉花、谷子、八瓣蒜等）以及改良农具（空心锄等）。还有把未浸过的种子和已浸过的种子结出的果实对比，演出时配合快板说明，借以提高农业技术。
    三、文化宣传组不但自己要积极带头工作，还应该组织或配合各种文化娱乐机构，利用各种文艺形式，和其他有关部门一起进行宣传活动。乡村中有许多有群众基础的艺术形式，如盲人宣传队，八音会、自乐班等，应注意研究，加以适当的改造，领导组织他们从事宣传活动，发挥他们的作用。汾阳文化宣传组因当地农村剧团多，且有一定的群众基础，他们就和农村剧团配合演出。这样并可以改造和提高农村剧团，教育他们接受新的东西。
    配合其他有关部门进行宣传，如和公安局配合宣传一贯道的罪行。把一贯道的罪恶活动排成戏，通过真人真事的演出，揭发一贯道的真面目。演出后，有很多人诉苦，要求退道。猗氏文化宣传组和农业部门合作，宣传“温汤浸种”，农业改进推广的同志先做说明，文化宣传组利用幻灯、快板等形式，宣传“温汤浸种”的好处和方法，然后改进推广农业的同志再帮助群众实地试验。卫生方面也是这样做法，效果都很好。
    四、创作上不但自己努力，还要发动和组织群众创作。今年春节从群众中产生了很多较好的作品，闻喜一县新创作有二百多件。昔阳、武乡等县的创作，在数量质量上都有些提高。这说明县里只要有人注意群众的创作，群众就会供给很多的材料，增加了文化宣传组的宣传武器。
    山西各县的文化宣传组，以轻骑队的方式活跃在广大乡村，进行文化教育宣传工作，做出了很好的成绩，同时使乡村群众文艺普及运动的辅导工作获得解决，使远离城镇的广大劳动人民在热烈的生产运动中，要求享受到文化生活，有了政治的思想的指导，有了健康的内容。
