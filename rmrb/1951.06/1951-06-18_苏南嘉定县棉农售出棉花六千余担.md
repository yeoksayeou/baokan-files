　　Cotton Farmers in Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu
    Sell More Than 6,000 Dan of Cotton
    The cotton sales and savings deposit movement for resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country in Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu, under the unified leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, adopted a method of promotion from point to area. Starting in early April, it basically concluded by mid-May. The entire county purchased more than 6,000 dan of seed cotton and absorbed savings deposits of more than 450 million yuan. During this movement, the county conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization to eliminate various ideological concerns of farmers regarding cotton sales and savings deposits. These concerns were: 1. Poor cotton farmers feared that others would know they had money and that they would not receive any more fruits of victory or be able to obtain loans. 2. Relatively well-off middle peasants and rich peasants feared exposing their property, feared others would borrow money from them, feared reclassification, and feared struggle. 3. They feared price fluctuations. In response to the above concerns, the county, in its propaganda and education, particularly emphasized that selling cotton and making savings deposits was for the clothing supply of the national military and civilians, beneficial to the country and oneself, and a concrete work of resisting America and aiding Korea. At the same time, it was explained that the government would reward and protect the patriotic actions of the masses in selling cotton and making savings deposits by all means, and that this would not change their class composition. Since most of the cotton depositors were middle peasants and rich peasants, meetings of middle and rich peasants were held during the work to eliminate concerns. Coupled with the leading role and promotion of cadres, the movement developed smoothly and achieved the current results.

　　苏南嘉定县棉农        
    售出棉花六千余担
    苏南嘉定县抗美援朝保家卫国的售棉储棉运动，在共产党和人民政府统一领导下，采取由点到面的推动方法，自四月上旬开始，到五月中旬已经基本结束。全县共收购籽棉六千余担，吸收储蓄存款四亿五千余万元。该县曾在这一运动中，进行了深入的宣传动员，消除农民对售棉储棉的各种思想顾虑。这些顾虑是：一、贫苦棉农怕人家知道有钱，再分不到胜利果实，借不到贷款。二、富裕中农和富农怕暴露财产，怕旁人向他借款，怕重划阶级，怕斗争。三、怕物价波动。针对上述顾虑，该县在宣传教育中，特别强调说明售棉储棉是为了全国军民的衣着供应，利国利己，是抗美援朝的具体工作。同时说明政府对群众这种售棉储棉的爱国行动，是以一切方法奖励和保护的，不会因此而改变其阶级成份。由于存棉户以中农和富农为多，在工作中即举行中、富农会议，使消除顾虑，再加上干部带头和推动，运动便顺利开展起来，收到现在的成绩。
