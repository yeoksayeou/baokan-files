　　Thirty-One Mutual Aid Teams in Huantai County, Shandong Province
　　Set Up Wheat Harvesting Plans to Challenge the Entire Province
　　And Guarantee a One-Time Payment of Summer Grain Tax
    Three hundred and thirty-nine mutual aid teams and thirteen labor models in ten wheat-producing counties in Shandong Province, including Wendeng and Huantai, have recently formulated summer harvest and summer selection plans to challenge forty-seven mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. Among them, thirty-one mutual aid teams and thirteen labor models in Huantai County are also challenging mutual aid teams in wheat-producing areas throughout the province. Their challenge conditions are: seven days before the wheat harvest, prepare the agricultural tools needed for harvesting wheat, the repair of threshing grounds, and the allocation of manpower and animal power; mobilize men, women, old and young to participate in the wheat harvest, reaping as soon as the wheat is ripe, and ensuring that the wheat is threshed and stored within seven days of arriving at the threshing ground; mobilize the militia to stand guard to prevent sabotage by special agents and bandits, and at the same time prevent wind, rain, and hail; do a good job in selecting good seed ears in the fields, and all the good wheat varieties planted last winter should be harvested, threshed, and stored separately to ensure that the seed purity reaches more than 95% and the uniformity reaches 85%; in addition, do a good job of plowing for others; guarantee a one-time payment of summer grain tax; after the wheat harvest, do a good job of comparing crops, comparing harvests, evaluating seeds, and evaluating models among villages, townships, and districts.
