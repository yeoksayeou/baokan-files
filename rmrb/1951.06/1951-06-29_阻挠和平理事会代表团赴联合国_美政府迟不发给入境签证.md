Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: TASS, London, June 24th: The British Peace Committee issued a statement on June 23rd stating that Mrs. Jessie Street (Australia) and Mrs. Davies (Britain), members of the World Peace Council delegation planning to go to the United Nations to meet with the Chairman of the Security Council, have been delayed in obtaining U.S. entry visas.

The statement said that after Mrs. Davies and Mrs. Street received a reply from Malik inviting the delegation to go to New York to meet with him from June 25th to 27th, they immediately applied for U.S. entry visas.

The statement said that the U.S. Consulate in England had notified the two women that their applications had been forwarded to Washington, but because all consulates routinely close on weekends, the entry visas might not arrive in time, and therefore they would not be able to arrive in New York before June 25th.

The British Peace Committee telegraphed Malik about this matter on June 22nd and received a reply from Malik on the morning of June 23rd as follows: "I have immediately forwarded your telegram to Mr. Austin, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, asking him to help find a way to get you entry visas to come to New York as soon as possible."

　　阻挠和平理事会代表团赴联合国
    美政府迟不发给入境签证
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：英国和平委员会于六月二十三日发表声明说：世界和平理事会拟派赴联合国会见安全理事会主席的代表团团员杰西·斯崔特夫人（澳大利亚）和戴维斯夫人（英国），现在迟迟不能获得美国的入境签证。
    声明说：戴维斯夫人和斯崔特夫人接到马立克邀请代表团可于六月二十五日至二十七日到纽约去会见他的复电以后，立即申请美国入境签证。
    声明说：美国驻英领事馆曾通知她们两人，说她们的申请书已转往华盛顿，但因各领事馆于周末照例休假，入境签证或不能及时到达，因此，她们就不能于六月二十五日以前到达纽约。
    英国和平委员会已于六月二十二日将此事电告马立克，并于六月二十三日早上接到马立克的答复如下：“我已立刻将你们的电报转交给美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀，请他协助设法使你们能早日获得前来纽约的入境签证。”
