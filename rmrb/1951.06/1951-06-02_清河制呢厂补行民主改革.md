　　Qinghe Woolen Mill Conducts Supplementary Democratic Reform
    Zhang Buke, Zhang Wankun, Zhao ?zhan
    The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing was established in 1908. During the period of Japanese puppet rule and Kuomintang rule, military management was implemented, and the relationship between staff, workers, and soldiers was one of officers and men. The phenomenon of beating and scolding workers was particularly serious, workers' lives were very painful, and production efficiency was very low. In the early days of liberation, the factory abolished the system of oppressing workers, organized political study for employees, stabilized workers' lives, and initially inspired workers' political enthusiasm. However, because the leading cadres did not earnestly rely on the masses to thoroughly implement democratic reform, the workers were not truly mobilized. After June 1950, the factory began to earnestly implement democratic management. Especially after the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, workers were mobilized to recall their sufferings, traitors and bullies hated by the workers were arrested, and old foremen who were unsatisfactory to the workers were replaced. The workers' class consciousness rapidly increased, and the attitude of being masters of their labor began to be established, and production efficiency increased dramatically. Taking the average monthly output of yarn in 1947 (during the Kuomintang rule) as 100 percent, the average monthly output in the first half of 1950 was 127 percent; in the second half of 1950, because the masses had been initially mobilized, the average monthly output jumped to 216 percent; especially in December, after traitors and bullies most hated by the workers were eliminated, the monthly output increased to 284 percent.
    When democratic reform was not thoroughly carried out, the Party, administration, and trade union were seriously divorced from the masses
    From the liberation of the factory in December 1948 to May 1950, although some achievements were made in restoring production, the Party, administration, and trade union were divorced from the masses during this period, and the workers were basically not mobilized. During this period, the Factory Management Committee and the Staff and Workers Representative Conference were never established. Production plans were formulated only by a few administrative leaders, and the workers did not know whether they could be completed. What was particularly serious was that the workers repeatedly demanded the removal of Wang Shoulong, a traitor and bully in the combing and spinning department who had colluded with the Japanese invaders, forced people to death, and raped female workers. However, the administrative leaders believed that he "had technical skills" and that "the combing and spinning department could not operate without him," and maintained his original position, only wanting to persuade Wang Shoulong to bow his head to the workers. In July 1949, when the administrative side was forced to hold a mass meeting, it called the meeting a "reasoning meeting." At the meeting, the workers accused Wang Shoulong and others of their crimes and demanded "expulsion from the factory" and "execution." However, the factory director and a few trade union cadres advised the workers to "look at the big picture and unite with technical personnel." Later, under the firm opposition of the workers, Wang was dismissed and sent to the enterprise bureau cadre school for study; but he was soon transferred back to the factory to work in wool purchasing. Wang Shoulong said to the workers: "The Japanese treated me well, the Kuomintang treated me well, and the Communist Party will treat me well too. I have skills, what am I afraid of?" At the same time, the old foremen who had oppressed the workers during the enemy-puppet period were left untouched, and most of them still had very bad styles. The workers said: "Everywhere else is liberated, but the Qinghe Woolen Mill is not." "What democracy? It's like workers' words are not worth anything!"
    The leading cadres of the Party and the trade union supported the erroneous opinions of the administrative leaders, and were also opposed by the masses. However, they unprincipledly required Party members and Youth League members to "persuade the masses" to ensure the completion of tasks. Therefore, some workers said: "Party members and Youth League members are those who climb up the pole." The trade union did not actively support the reasonable and solvable demands put forward by the workers. For example, when struggling against Wang Shoulong, most of the trade union cadres did not support the workers' opinions, and some even had to take on the task of "persuading" the masses. Therefore, the trade union's prestige among the masses was very low. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to establish the workers' attitude as masters, and production efficiency was very low. Until March 1950, the efficiency of the looms was only 17.2 percent, and the efficiency of the spinning machines was about 30 percent (the national minimum standard is 50 percent). Coupled with poor sales, the factory lost more than 2.7 million catties of millet in 1949.
            Implementing democratic management initially mobilized the masses
    In June 1950, according to the policy of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to implement democratic management, organize labor competitions, and implement reward systems, the factory convened a staff and workers representative conference, established a factory management committee, strengthened the leadership of the Party and the work of the trade union; the leading cadres began to rely on the workers. At the end of July, the factory accepted the state's order contract and launched a mass labor competition. The Party general branch first discussed the production plan, carried out unified deployment, and the factory director reported the production plan through the factory management committee, the Party members and Youth League members' conference, and the workshop workers' conference. Then the trade union mobilized the workers to discuss production tasks and formulate group plans. The cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League went deep into the workshops to mobilize the masses to ensure the completion of the production plan. In this way, the workers' enthusiasm was high, and a competition craze was set off. As a result of the competition, the state's order tasks were completed ahead of schedule, and many labor models emerged, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the employees. In this competition, the relationship between the Party, administration, trade union, Youth League, and the masses also changed. Although this competition achieved great results, since the stones pressing on the workers' heads had not been removed, most workers were still not truly mobilized ideologically.
            Democratic reform changed the face of the Qinghe Woolen Mill
    Last November, during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the factory mobilized the workers to recount their sufferings. Initially, individual leading comrades had ideological concerns, fearing that recounting sufferings would delay production, and that workers would not only recount the sufferings caused by Wang Shoulong, but also the sufferings caused by the foremen, causing chaos in the workshops and failing to complete the production tasks of the second batch of state orders. Therefore, they did not dare to firmly support the workers' correct demands. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized this erroneous thinking, pointing out: "It is necessary to mobilize the workers to recount their sufferings and solve the problems of Wang Shoulong and others according to the workers' reasonable demands. Otherwise, the Qinghe Woolen Mill will not have had a revolution yet." Only then did it correct the cadres' erroneous thinking and mobilize the workers to recount their sufferings. In order to dispel the masses' concerns such as "fearing it won't work," the Party general branch of the factory openly reviewed the mistakes of not earnestly relying on the working class and not dealing with traitors and bullies such as Wang Shoulong for a long time in the past. At the suffering recounting meeting, the Public Security Bureau, based on the opinions of the masses, arrested Wang Shoulong and Fu Songqing and other bullies hated by the workers on the spot. The workers' enthusiasm rose sharply, and the daily output of yarn increased from more than 2,100 kilograms to more than 2,300 kilograms on the same day. After the suffering recounting meeting, the administration accepted the workers' demands and dismissed nine old foremen who had oppressed the workers in the past and had not changed after liberation, and the trade union organized the workers to democratically elect workshop directors, who were recommended to the administration for appointment. These new workshop directors were able to connect with the masses, work actively and responsibly, and also had good skills. The workers were very satisfied and said: "This is real democracy!" "Now we can breathe smoothly!" "This is truly liberation!" The workers' class consciousness was universally improved, a large number of backward elements were transformed, especially the workers who had turned from positive to negative after the "reasoning meeting" in 1949, and are now active again. The weaving department changed from a backward workshop to an advanced workshop. In the past, many people in this workshop often bargained with the leaders when completing production tasks. Now, in order to ensure the execution of the contract, all automatically worked an extra hour every day for two weeks, so that the second batch of state orders were delivered on schedule. In the past, workers who only cared about welfare now took the initiative to propose: "If there are tasks, we will guarantee them!" The antagonistic emotions between workers and leaders were swept away. Workers who used to say that the trade union was "useless" now said: "The trade union really works for the workers."
    Under such circumstances, the factory's production has made great strides forward. Until July 1950, before the competition was launched, the average daily output of each spinning machine was only about 160 kilograms, but in January, February, and March 1951, it had exceeded 450 kilograms on average. The efficiency of the looms was only 17.2 percent in 1950, but it increased to 62 percent in March 1951. The factory began to change from losing money to making money, and the surplus for the whole year of 1950 reached more than 4 billion yuan after paying taxes.

　　清河制呢厂补行民主改革
    张布克　张万琨　赵?沾
    北京市清河制呢厂，建立于一九○八年。日伪和国民党统治时期，实行军事管理，职员工人为官兵关系，打骂工人现象特别严重，工人生活非常痛苦，生产效率很低。解放初期，该厂取消了压迫工人的制度，组织了职工的政治学习，安定了工人生活，初步启发了工人的政治热情。但因为领导干部没有认真依靠群众，彻底实行民主改革，因之工人并没有真正发动起来。一九五○年六月以后，该厂开始认真实行民主管理。特别是抗美援朝运动展开后，发动工人回忆诉苦，逮捕工人痛恨的汉奸恶霸分子，撤换工人所不满意的旧工长，工人的阶级觉悟迅速提高，主人翁的劳动态度开始树立，生产效率飞跃提高。以一九四七年（国民党统治时期）纱的平均月产量为百分之一百，一九五○年上半年平均月产量是百分之一百二十七；一九五○年下半年因群众已初步发动，平均月产量一跃提高到百分之二百一十六；尤其是十二月，清除了工人所最痛恨的汉奸恶霸分子，月产量提高到百分之二百八十四。
    没有彻底进行民主改革时，党、行政、工会严重脱离群众
    该厂自一九四八年十二月解放到一九五○年五月，虽然在恢复生产上做出了一些成绩，但由于这一时期党、行政、工会脱离群众，工人基本上没有发动起来。在这期间，工厂管理委员会和职工代表会一直没有成立。生产计划只由行政领导上少数人制定，完成完不成工人根本不知道。尤其严重的是，工人几次要求清除曾勾结日寇、逼死人命、强奸女工的汉奸恶霸梳纺部技佐王寿隆，而行政领导干部却认为他“有技术”，“梳纺部离开他，就开不了工”，一直维持原职不动，只想说服王寿隆向工人低头了事。一九四九年七月，行政方面被迫召开群众大会时，还把大会叫做“说理会”。会上工人控诉王寿隆等的罪行，提出“开除出厂”，“枪毙”等要求。而厂长和少数工会干部却劝工人“把眼光放远点，团结技术人员”。后来，在工人的坚决反对下，才把王撤职送企业局干部学校学习；但不久又调回工厂担任买毛工作。王寿隆对工人说：“日本人在我吃的开，国民党来我也吃的开，共产党来照样吃的开，我有技术怕什么？”同时，敌伪时期欺压工人的旧工长，也原封未动，大多数作风仍旧很坏。工人说：“哪里也解放啦，就是清河制呢厂没有解放。”“什么民主，工人说话还不和白说一样？”
    党和工会的领导干部支持行政领导干部的错误意见，也遭受群众反对。但他们却无原则地要求党员和青年团员“说服群众”，保证完成任务。因此，有的工人说：“党员和青年团员是顺杆儿爬。”工会对工人提出的合理而又可能解决的要求却不积极支持。如斗争王寿隆时，工会干部大多不去支持工人的意见，有些反而要担任“说服”群众的任务。因此，工会在群众中的威信很低。在这种情况下，工人主人翁的劳动态度不可能树立起来，生产效率非常低。直到一九五○年三月，织机效率只发挥了百分之十七点二，纺纱机效率约发挥了百分之三十（全国最低标准为百分之五十）。再加上销路不好，一九四九年工厂赔钱二百七十多万斤小米。
            实行民主管理，初步发动了群众
    一九五○年六月，该厂根据中国共产党北京市委员会提出的实行民主管理，组织劳动竞赛，实行奖励制度的方针，召开了职工代表会议，成立了工厂管理委员会，加强了党的领导和工会工作；领导干部开始依靠工人。七月底，该厂接受了国家的订货合同，发动了群众性的劳动竞赛。党总支首先讨论生产计划，进行了统一布置，厂长通过工厂管理委员会、党员团员大会、车间工人大会，报告了生产计划。然后工会发动工人讨论生产任务，订立小组计划。党、行政、工会、青年团的干部都深入车间发动群众，保证生产计划的完成。这样，工人情绪高涨，掀起了竞赛热潮。竞赛结果，国家订货任务提前完成，并且涌现出来很多劳动模范，对于职工生产情绪起了很大鼓舞作用。在这次竞赛中，党、行政、工会、青年团与群众的关系也改变了。这次竞赛虽然有很大成绩，但由于压在工人头上的石头还没挪开，多数工人仍然没有从思想上真正发动起来。
            民主改革改变了清河制呢厂的面貌
    去年十一月，抗美援朝运动中，该厂曾发动工人诉苦。最初，个别领导同志思想有顾虑，怕诉苦耽误生产，怕工人不但诉王寿隆的苦，而且会诉工长的苦，造成车间的混乱，完不成第二批国家订货的生产任务，因之不敢坚决支持工人的正确要求。中国共产党北京市委员会对这种错误思想提出批评，指出：“必须发动工人诉苦，按照工人的合理要求解决王寿隆等人的问题。不然，清河制呢厂就还没有革命。”这才纠正了干部的错误思想，发动工人诉苦。为了打破群众“怕不顶事”等顾虑，该厂中国共产党党总支公开检讨了过去未认真依靠工人阶级、长期没处理王寿隆等汉奸恶霸的错误。诉苦大会上，公安局根据群众意见，当场逮捕了王寿隆和傅松清等工人痛恨的恶霸。工人情绪顿时高涨，当天纱的日产量就由二千一百多公斤提高到二千三百多公斤。诉苦大会后，行政上又接受了工人的要求，把九个过去欺压过工人、解放后仍无转变的旧工长撤职，由工会组织工人民主选举车间主任，推荐给行政任用。这些新车间主任，都能联系群众，工作积极负责，并且技术也好。工人非常满意，说：“这回真民主了！”“现在可顺气了！”“这回真是解放了！”工人的阶级觉悟普遍提高，大批落后分子转变了，尤其在一九四九年“说理会”后由积极变为消极的工人，现在又积极起来了。机织部由落后的车间一变为先进的车间。该车间过去有不少人，在完成生产任务时，常和领导方面讨价还价。现在为了保证执行合同，全体自动在两星期内，每天加点一小时，使第二批国家订货按期交货。过去只关心福利的工人，现在也主动地提出：“有任务，我们就保证！”工人和领导间的对立情绪扫清了。过去说工会“不顶用”的工人，现在却说：“工会可真给工人办事。”
    在这种情况下，该厂生产大踏步前进了。直到一九五○年七月份开展竞赛以前，平均每台纺纱机的日产量仅为一百六十公斤左右，一九五一年一、二、三月份平均已超过四百五十公斤。织机效率在一九五○年仅发挥了百分之十七点二，一九五一年三月提高到百分之六十二。工厂开始由赔钱变为赚钱，一九五○年全年除交税收外，盈余达四十余亿元。
