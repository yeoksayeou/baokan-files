　　　　　　I

　　During the discussion of the film "The Story of Wu Xun," I read a book that praises Wu Xun in an artistic form, called "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" (compiled by Li Shizhao, drawn by Sun Zhijun).

　　The main content and structure of this book are similar to the film "The Story of Wu Xun," although its ideological expression methods are not entirely the same as the film. But it is basically the same as the film, nothing more than praising Wu Xun's "great spirit" and "personality" from all aspects.

　　In the picture biography, the compilers and illustrators directly praise and promote Wu Xun's reactionary feudal slave ideology, adding far-fetched explanations to all of Wu Xun's ugly behaviors and reactionary backward ideas to praise and commend them.

　　The book begins in Section 8 with the following introduction to Wu Xun: "He behaves very 'loyally and honestly' in his dealings with people. People in the village thought he was a 'fool' and often ridiculed him," and also says, "Ordinary villagers even called him 'Wu Doumo', a nickname with a satirical meaning," (Section 21). According to the above words, a character who is often satirized and ridiculed by the masses, who the compiler calls "ordinary villagers," is praised by the compiler as "loyal and honest," (it can be seen that at the beginning of this book, there is a great difference between the compiler and the masses' views on Wu Xun.) Therefore, let us compare the "loyal and honest" portrait of Wu Xun listed at the beginning of the volume, and we will find that the "peasant labor model" (artist's preface) that the painter painstakingly portrays is in fact very accurately painted as a eunuch-type character with mental decline, loose muscles, a worried face, and a low voice, without any spark.

　　The compilers and illustrators systematically praised Wu Xun's slave ideology. When expressing his suffering from being bullied, the compilers and illustrators painted a slave-like appearance for him. In Section 10, the compiler describes Wu Xun's uncle (his master) "often bullied him and beat him because he was too loyal and honest, and Wu Xun endured it all." In Section 12, it says that because he spilled pig food on the ground, "he was beaten black and blue by the Li family's servants. Wu Xun was unable to resist and could only swallow his anger and shed tears in secret." At the same time, in a series of scenes where Wu Xun is beaten, the artist deliberately draws Wu Xun with his hands clasped in supplication, not daring to resist; not only does he not have the strength to fight back, but he does not even have the courage to struggle and dodge, only to be manipulated like a chick under the claws of an eagle. It really shows his full of slavishness!

　　By the second half of the book, the compilers and illustrators had even more emphasized his "kowtow-ism." For example, when the artist dealt with Wu Xun meeting those gentlemen and dignitaries such as Lou Jinshi, Yang Jinshi, Guo Zhixian... etc., he showed Wu Xun bowing his head and bending his waist, being respectful; especially in Section 65, when he was summoned by Zhang Yao, the Governor of Shandong, Wu Xun in the artist's pen was even more trembling and at a loss, and his facial expression even showed a kind of flattered look, which shows that in the "excellent" character portrayed by the compilers and illustrators, there is not only a servile face but also a flattering bone.

　　Why do the compilers and illustrators attach so much importance to and like Wu Xun's servility, and emphasize and promote it so much? I think the main reason is that both the compiler and the artist unanimously affirmed that Wu Xun's shameful attitude of enduring abuse and servility towards those who beat him and bullied him (the feudal landlord class) is "loyal and honest," a kind of "tolerance" (Section 24), and a feudal virtue that is "worthy of praise and should be emulated" (Author's Preface)!

　　Of course, Wu Xun's "loyalty and honesty" and "tolerance" were undoubtedly welcomed by the feudal ruling class, which has been shown in many pictures in the second half of the book. However, from beginning to end, the compilers and illustrators not only did not analyze and criticize Wu Xun's various shameful behaviors and their results, but also tried their best to exaggerate things like the feudal ruling class's "commendation and praise," "rewarding him with a yellow jacket," and "erecting a memorial arch." Even at the end of the book, they especially used several sections to describe the "posthumous honor" awarded to him by the feudal ruling class after Wu Xun's death, such as announcing that he would be included in the Manchu Qing National History Museum, enshrining him in the ancestral halls of the three counties (Section 82), worshiping him together with Confucius (Section 83), and even bringing the "imperial gift" plaque of the Northern Warlord "President Xu" (Xu Shichang) into the book. (In this book, even if the compilers add a few seemingly critical minor notes in the brief explanation (Section 85), the real intention is to promote it from the compiler's and illustrator's emphasis on these deeds, and how disproportionate those minor words are compared with these "spectacular" deeds!) Presumably, in the eyes of the compilers and illustrators, such "honor" is indeed "worthy of praise" and should be called on everyone to "emulate."

　　Not only that, but the compilers and illustrators also unreservedly adopted a positive attitude towards Wu Xun's other various ugly behaviors, and also added various far-fetched and pleasant explanations: for example, Wu Xun's gifting of land to the "chaste woman" Zhang Chen, to commend her chastity and filial piety (Section 45), which was originally Wu Xun's attitude of maintaining and protecting the cannibalistic ethics of the feudal order, is interpreted by this book as "class friendship"; Wu Xun's personal abnormal asceticism of self-mutilation and self-poking that lost his self-esteem, such as eating snakes and scorpions, being ridden and beaten by others, etc., is interpreted as "arduous" and "sacrificial spirit"; Wu Xun's improper occupation of matchmaker in the countryside is also interpreted as "contacting the masses," and, for example, the superstitious elements in Wu Xun's thoughts—those words like "there is a true god in heaven," "lightning strikes the fire dragon" that constantly appear in his ballads, are actually interpreted as the "practical" "historical materialism" (Author's Preface). This is simply incoherent. In short, in this book, the compilers and illustrators put a beautiful sugar coating on all the toxins in Wu Xun's thoughts and offered them to the readers as top-quality goods.

　　　　　　II

　　Now, let's talk about the creator's creative ideas and methods from the pictures themselves:

　　First of all, after reading all the pictures in this book, we get a general impression that the painter clearly emphasizes the backwardness of old China in his pictures and images, and at the same time exaggerates the power and spirit of the feudal ruling class. For example, the painter pays special attention to highlighting the ugly image in the old society (this "ugliness" should be blamed on the feudal ruling class), such as men's braids, women's bound feet, burning incense and worshiping Buddha, being naked, kneeling, etc. Things that imperialism used to humiliate the Chinese people in reactionary propaganda in the past, reappear in these pictures. Therefore, we find that the painter is consciously uglifying and insulting the working people. For example, the women who appear in this book are almost all painted as coquettish and charming, and even added with erotic decorations. The women described in the explanatory text as "villagers" or "masses" are all painted with flirtatious eyes (page 147), covering their mouths with fans (page 67), and even painted with their waists and buttocks protruding (page 139), completely unlike decent people, which immediately arouses disgust. When depicting those men, they are painted as ugly, ignorant, and hateful. Where is there a bit of the atmosphere of the working people, such as the rickshaw pullers (page 75) and the workers building houses (page 107)?

　　The real working people, regardless of men and women, are definitely not like this. Although in the feudal society at that time, men were forced to keep their hair and women were forced to bind their feet, their faces were kind, their bodies were healthy, and the biggest characteristics of their demeanor and expression were simplicity, sincerity, solemnity, and generosity, definitely not like the kind of urban hooligans and prostitutes that the painter showed in this book. Definitely not like the base, dirty, slick, and cowardly appearance in the author's pen. Based on his own incorrect understanding and views of Chinese history and the working people, coupled with his clumsy skills and vulgar taste, the author finally distorted and uglified the images of all the working people in his pen.

　　In contrast, the author portrays the "power" of the feudal ruling class to the extreme. For example, when the author draws several scenes of the landlord beating Wu Xun, he draws the landlord's palms bigger than Wu Xun's head (pages 23, 29), and their arms thicker than Wu Xun's waist (page 27). We do not deny that in the old society of feudal rule, the ruling class was very fierce and cruel in front of the people, but this is not something absolute and permanent, and in the eyes of the people, it is not such a terrible thing. Therefore, it is not worth emphasizing and exaggerating in that way, and it is completely inconsistent with the facts to draw the image of the landlord as "Four Diamond Guardians." Such an excessive exaggeration of the power of the feudal ruling class is actually a manifestation of losing the people's self-esteem.

　　In short, the author made great mistakes in the ideology and method of creation; what is especially important is that as a painter, the author's most basic standpoint and method are inconsistent with the broad masses of people. Therefore, the emergence of this work is very harmful in terms of effect. And the author still shamelessly boasted in the preface that it conformed to the direction of "today's people's government's literary and artistic policy" and "facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Isn't this a great irony?

　　Since the popularization and in-depth movement to resist the United States and aid Korea and the development of patriotic education, we have had a further understanding of our great motherland and people. Our attitude towards the past history is also scientific and critical. As Chairman Mao said in "On New Democracy," we must respect our own history, but this respect is to give history a certain scientific status, to respect the dialectical development of history, not to praise the old and criticize the new, not to praise any feudal toxins! But in this book, what else can we find besides praising feudalism, exaggerating backwardness, slandering the working people, losing national self-esteem, and distorting progressive theories?

　　　　　　III

　　The above is a critique of the book "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" itself. Now let's talk about its compiler, Mr. Li Shizhao's "self-criticism" in the People's Daily on May 31:

　　First of all, because the compiler, Mr. Li Shizhao, used the title "I have initially realized the error of worshiping and promoting Wu Xun" in his self-criticism article, we believe that whether it is "initially" or whether he has already "realized" it, he has finally admitted that "worshiping and promoting Wu Xun" is an "error" rather than "correct." This most basic transformation is still welcome.

　　However, how does the author of this article understand the essence of his mistakes—his thoughts? From this article, it is difficult for us to find the author's clear analysis and self-criticism of the erroneous thoughts expressed in his "Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures." On the contrary, the author only does some work on some methods that are more like "concealment" than "self-criticism."

　　At the beginning of this article, the author believes that the error in compiling "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" is mainly that "not only is the criticism of historical materials not deep enough, but also committed a serious error of objectivism." Can these two sentences be regarded as the author's "self-criticism" of his mistakes?

　　Zhang Zaixue's "Bad Thoughts Under the Cover of Good Nouns" in the People's Daily on June 1 and Section I of this article have analyzed the author's most serious ideological errors, so I will not say much here. Now, let's just look at the author's "self-criticism" to see if it is consistent with the facts.

　　The author, Mr. Li, stated clearly in the "Author's Preface" of "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures": "Mr. Wu Xun's progressive ideas of anti-landlord, anti-local tyrant, anti-feudal system, anti-foot binding, and anti-superstition have always been impossible to express in the past, and now we have clarified them." This is the author's general intention in the book "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures." According to the author's "self-criticism," this is also the place where he believes that the criticism of historical materials is not deep enough, or the place where he believes that he "committed a serious error of objectivism."

　　However, how did the author conduct "criticism" of "historical materials"? The book "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" itself is the best illustration:

　　What did Wu Xun do in terms of so-called "anti-landlord" and "anti-local tyrant"? We can't find any facts from Wu Xun's life history. We can't find any meaning of "anti" at all except for seeing Wu Xun's humiliation, surrender, and tame kowtow to the landlords and local tyrants. Let's take Wu Xun's most "great" cause—"founding free schools"—as an example. We can also say that he almost completely relied on the landlord class. For example, Wu Xun saved the money he begged for in the landlord's place, charged usury, invited the landlord to preside over the preparation work of the free school, and entrusted the landlord class to handle the matters of buying land and building houses, kneeling to ask them to be school directors and teachers; Wu Xun himself thus squeezed into the ranks of the gentry, bureaucrats, and the reactionary rule of the Manchu Qing emperor. Can this be said to be Wu Xun's "resistance"?

　　The resistance of the people at that time to feudal rule was truly vigorous and flourishing. For example, the armed struggle of the Nien Rebellion, which was carried out at the same time and in the same place as Wu Xun's life, Wu Xun not only completely stayed out of it and remained indifferent, but also used this kind of "free school" to erode and paralyze the people's true resistance. Can this be regarded as "resistance" to "landlords and local tyrants"?

　　Not only that, Wu Xun was also sincerely convinced of the landlord class in his thoughts. For example, in his ballad, he sang: "Only good people build tall buildings, no evil tyrants can go to the end." It can be seen that in his opinion, those who "build tall buildings" must be "good people," and building tall buildings must be the reward for the adults and gentlemen to "accumulate blessings" and "do good deeds." The so-called evil tyrant is just used as an abstract foil. Moreover, in his opinion, all those who cannot "go to the end" must be "evil tyrants." His standard of "good people" and "evil tyrants" lies in "building tall buildings." Therefore, he naturally loves, trusts, and trusts those "good people" who live in tall buildings and mansions.

　　Secondly, the author's saying that Wu Xun "opposed the feudal system" is also completely inconsistent with historical facts. As the biggest and most concentrated expression of opposition to the feudal system, nothing is more than directly fighting against the feudal ruling class, trying to fundamentally overthrow the feudal system and liberate the people oppressed under the feudal system. This point has nothing to do with Wu Xun's thoughts and behaviors. Wu Xun was a "concrete practitioner" of the feudal system. There is no need to say that his establishment of "free schools" was aimed at maintaining the feudal system. For example, the work of matchmaker, which was his second career in his later years, was precisely the concrete implementation of the feudal marriage system of "the order of parents and the words of matchmakers"! Other things such as donating money to chaste women have been mentioned before, so I won't say more here.

　　Judging from these facts, even if we take the self-criticism of the attitude and method towards history, which the compiler specifically put forward in the "self-criticism," is it correct? We feel that the above facts show that the author's view and statement on history not only did not conduct "criticism" but also conducted extremely boring concealment, and of course, it is even less possible to talk about "profound" or not "profound." At the same time, the author's method of analyzing historical facts is not a problem of "objectivism," but arbitrarily adding some far-fetched distortions to history based on his own prejudices. Here, we first ask Mr. Li to seriously face the real history from all aspects and calmly look at the objective facts before continuing to conduct a self-criticism of his erroneous thoughts in order to achieve further and better self-criticism. This is very necessary.

　　Finally, what must be mentioned is that in this article, the author seems to believe that Mr. Tao Xingzhi's advocacy of the "Wu Xun spirit" still has its positive significance. For example, the author said: "I affirm that all those who have worshiped Wu Xun because they have been influenced by Mr. Tao's advocacy of the 'Wu Xun spirit' have their positive aspects," and also said: "People who have seen Wu Xun in the movie must have created his confused thoughts. This responsibility lies with the movie, and cannot be attributed to Mr. Tao."

　　This seems to say that Mr. Tao was right in advocating the "Wu Xun spirit," and those who followed Mr. Tao's influence and advocated the "Wu Xun spirit" were also right. Therefore, the Wu Xun advocated was not as bad as in the movie, and only the movie was the most undesirable.

　　This is an extremely incorrect quibble. The errors in the movie have been mentioned above, and have been clearly criticized in many articles, so there is no need to say more here; as for Mr. Tao's advocacy of the "Wu Xun spirit," Comrade Yang Er's article in the People's Daily has also made an extremely thorough analysis. The author's statement proves that he did not understand it very well.

　　The author spent a lot of space and used an unusually emotional tone to describe that Mr. Tao was oppressed by the Kuomintang gang "because he advocated the Wu Xun spirit." It seems that the author feels quite wronged for Mr. Tao and those who followed him in advocating Wu Xun, and wants to use Mr. Tao's lifelong revolutionary achievements to clear the errors he committed in the specific event of advocating the "Wu Xun spirit," and to defend those who followed him in advocating Wu Xun.

　　This attitude is also very bad. Mr. Tao has his own indelible achievements. As Comrade Yang Er said, the main thing is that he fought unyieldingly against the Chiang Kai-shek gang to the end, while advocating the "Wu Xun spirit" was "inappropriate." Then, if there were many progressive elements among those who had followed Mr. Tao in advocating Wu Xun in the past, I think that was mainly because they were educated by Mr. Tao's revolutionary fighting spirit, and not because they were "influenced" by Mr. Tao's advocacy of the "Wu Xun spirit" and had their "positive aspects." On this point, Mr. Tao cannot cover up for all those who followed him in advocating Wu Xun, and those people cannot even turn the erroneous thoughts of worshiping and promoting Wu Xun into "correct" because they have been "educated" and "influenced" by Mr. Tao in their thoughts and careers.

　　Undoubtedly, the movie "The Story of Wu Xun" has serious errors, but its errors do not lie in the author's belief that it distorted Wu Xun's personality in some places. The main error is that it takes praising Wu Xun as its theme. Naturally, the movie bears a great responsibility for educating the audience with Wu Xun's erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and causing "confused thoughts" in the audience.

　　At the same time, using picture biographies instead of movies to praise and promote Wu Xun's erroneous thoughts and personality will also "cause ideological confusion" among readers and also bear a great responsibility. What's more, those who had worshiped, promoted, and advocated Wu Xun before the movie appeared should especially "actively face their own errors" in their own erroneous thoughts and practices, humbly conduct self-criticism, and study well the correct criticisms put forward in the discussion of the movie "The Story of Wu Xun" in order to clarify their "confused thoughts." I think this is very necessary for the author, Mr. Li.

### 评《武训画传》及李士钊先生的检讨

　　评《武训画传》及李士钊先生的检讨
    朱丹
            一
    在电影《武训传》的讨论过程中，我看了一本以美术形式来歌颂武训的书，叫《武训画传》。（李士钊编、孙之俊画）
    这本书的主要内容和结构都和电影《武训传》差不多，虽然它的思想表现方法，与电影不尽相同。但它在基本上和电影相同，无非是从各方面来颂扬武训的“伟大精神”与“人格”。
    在画传上，编绘者直截了当地歌颂与宣扬着武训的反动的封建的奴才思想，把武训的一切丑恶行为和反动落后思想都加上牵强附会的解释而给以歌颂和赞扬。
    本书一开始在第八节中就对武训作了这样的介绍：“对人处世，都表现得十分‘忠诚浑厚’。庄上的人以为他是一个‘傻子’，常有人讥笑他，”又说：“一般乡下人更都称他为‘武豆沫’，是一个含有讽刺意味的绰号，”（第二十一节）。根据上面的话，被编者称为“一般乡下人”的群众所时常讽刺与讥笑的人物，编者却称赞他为“忠诚浑厚”，（可见在本书一开始，编者和群众对武训的看法，就有极大的分歧。）因此，再让我们对照着看看那张列在卷首的武训的“忠诚浑厚”的画像，我们也就发现，原来被作画的人专心刻划的“农民劳动模范”（画者序），事实上，倒是很正确地被画成了一个精神颓萎、筋肉松弛、愁眉苦脸、低声下气的毫无火性的太监型的人物。
    编绘者对于武训的奴才思想，进行了有系统的歌颂。在表现他受人欺辱的时候，编绘者更是替他活画了一副奴才相。在第十节编者描写武训的姨父（他的主人）“因为他为人过分忠厚，常常欺侮他，打他，武训都加以忍受。”在第十二节，又说他因把猪食洒在地上，“被李家的家奴打得遍体鳞伤，武训无力反抗，只有忍气吞声的暗自流泪。”同时，在这里一连串几个武训挨打的画面，画者也都特意把武训画得拱手求饶，不敢抵抗；不仅没有半点还手之力，就连挣扎躲闪的勇气都没有，只有像老鹰爪下的小鸡一样，无可如何地受人摆布，真是表现得奴性十足！
    到了本书的后半部，编绘者就格外地发扬了他的“磕头主义”了。如画者在处理武训去见那些绅士达官如娄进士、杨进士、郭知县……等人的时候，就表现着武训的俯首躬腰、必恭必敬；特别是他在第六十五节被山东巡抚张曜召见的那个场面，画者笔下的武训，更显出战战兢兢手足无措，在面部表情上还带有一种受宠若惊的神态，这就表现着在编绘者所刻划的武训的“优良”的性格里面，不仅有奴颜而且有媚骨了。
    本书的编绘者为什么这样重视与喜欢武训的奴性，而又强调地刻划与宣扬它呢？我想主要的原因是编者和绘者都一致肯定了武训这一种对待打他、欺侮他的人（封建地主阶级）的逆来顺受和奴颜婢膝的可耻态度，是“忠诚浑厚”，是一种“雅量”（第二十四节），是“值得歌颂而且应当效法的”（著者序）封建美德！
    当然，武训的这一种“忠诚浑厚”和“雅量”，是毫无疑问地为封建统治阶级所欢迎的，这已经在本书的后半部的许多画面上表现出来了。但本书从头到尾，编绘者对于武训种种可耻的行为及其结果，不但没有加以分析与批判，且而把封建统治阶级对于武训的“表旌褒扬”，“赏穿黄马褂”，“立牌坊”这一类事情，极力夸耀。甚至于在本书的结尾，还特别用了好几节的篇幅，来描绘封建统治阶级在武训死后赏给他的身后的“哀荣”，如宣付满清国史馆立传，入祀三县乡贤祠（八十二节），与孔子同祭祀（八十三节），以至连北洋军阀“徐大总统”（徐世昌）的“钦赐”匾额都拉到书上来。（这些事情，在本书上，编者纵然在简短的说明（八十五节）里面加上几句好像批评似的轻微的按语，可是从编绘者着重地表现这些事迹看来，实在的用意是在宣扬它的，而且那些轻微的话语和这些“轰轰烈烈”的事迹对比起来，是多么不相称呀！）大概在编绘者看来，这样的“荣誉”，确是“值得歌颂”而且应当号召大家“效法”的了。
    不仅如此，编绘者对于武训其他种种的丑恶行为，也都无保留地采取了肯定的态度，并且还牵强附会地加上种种好听的解释：如武训赠田给“节妇”张陈氏，以表彰她的贞节孝道的事（四十五节），本来是武训对于作为封建秩序的吃人礼教的一种维经护道的态度，本书却把它解释成“阶级友爱”；武训个人的那种丧失自尊心的自残自戳的反常苦行，如：吃蛇蝎、供人骑打等等，却被解释成“艰苦卓绝”的“牺牲精神”；武训在农村中那种说媒拉纤的不正当职业，也被解释成“联系群众”，再如在武训思想里面的迷信成份——那些在他的歌谣里面不断出现的“上天有真神”，“雷劈火龙抓”一类的话，竟被解释成为“实际上”的“历史唯物主义的身体力行”（著者序）这简直是语无伦次了。总之，在这本书上，编绘者是把武训思想里面的种种毒素，都给加上一层美丽的糖衣，都当做上品美品地奉献给了读者。
            二
    现在，我们再从图画本身来谈一谈作画者的创作思想和创作方法：
    首先，在看完本书的全部图画之后，我们得到一个总的印象，就是作画的人在他的画面和形象里面，明显地强调了旧中国的落后性，同时夸张了封建统治阶级的威风和神气。如画者对于旧社会里的丑的形象，（这种“丑”应该归罪于封建统治阶级一手所造成）都特别加以凸出的表现；如男人的辫子、女人的小脚、烧香拜庙、赤膊、下跪等从前帝国主义在反动宣传上常常用来污辱中国人的东西，又从这些画面上一一浮现在我们的眼底。因此，我们就发现画者是在有意识地丑化和污辱着劳动人民，如出现在这本书上的女人，几乎统统画得风骚妖冶，甚至加上色情的装饰，像在说明文字里被称为“乡下人”或“群众”的女人都画得丢着媚眼（一四七页），用扇子掩着口（六十七页），甚至画得挺腰凸臀（一三九页），完全不像正经人，让人看了立刻就会引起反感。在描绘那些男人的时候，又画得丑陋愚昧，面目可憎，如推车的车夫（七五页）和盖房子的工人（一○七页），那里还有一点劳动人民的气息？
    真正的劳动人民，不管男女都决不是这样的。虽然在那时的封建社会，男人要被迫留头发，女人要被迫缠足，但是他（她）们的面目是善良的，身体是健康的，他们的风度和表情的最大特点是朴素、诚恳、庄重大方，决不像画者在本书上所表现的那种近乎城市流氓和妓女的样子。决不像作者笔下的这种卑鄙肮脏、油滑怯懦的样子。这些，作者根据他自己对中国历史及劳动人民的不正确的理解和看法，再加上他的拙劣的技巧和庸俗化的趣味观点，终于在他的笔下，使所有劳动人民的形象都被歪曲和丑化了。
    与此相对的是作者笔下的封建统治阶级。作者对于统治阶级的“威风”是极尽其夸张之能事的。如作者在画地主打武训的几个场面时，把地主的巴掌画得比武训的头还大（二十三、二十九页），把他们的膀臂画得比武训的腰还粗（二十七页）。我们并不否认，在封建统治的旧社会里边，统治阶级在人民面前，是很凶狠残暴的，可是这并不是什么绝对的永久的东西，在人民眼中看来，也并不是那样可怕的东西，因此，并不值得那样去强调夸张，而且把地主的形象个个都画成“四大金刚”的样子，是完全不合乎事实的，这样过份地夸张封建统治阶级的力量，实际上就是一种丧失人民自尊心的表现。
    总之，作者在创作的思想与方法上都犯了很大的错误；尤其重要的是，作为一个画家来说，作者的最基本的立场和方法，和广大人民是不一致的，因此，这部作品的出现，从效果上来看，是十分有害的。而作者却偏偏还在自序里面大言不惭地强诩为符合“今天人民政府的文艺政策”“面向工农兵”的方向，这岂不是一个天大的讽刺吗？
    自从普及深入抗美援朝运动和开展爱国主义教育以来，我们对于我们伟大的祖国和人民都有了进一步的认识。对于过去的历史，我们的态度也是科学的批判的。正如毛主席在《新民主主义论》里面所说的，我们必须尊重自己的历史，但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素！但在这部书里，我们除去找到歌颂封建，夸大落后、污蔑劳动人民、丧失民族自尊心、和对于进步理论的曲解之外，我们还能找到什么呢？
        三
    以上是对于《武训画传》这部书本身的批评，现在我们再来谈谈它的编者李士钊先生在五月三十一日人民日报上所作的“检讨”吧：
    首先，因为编者李士钊先生在检讨的文章上用了“我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误”的题目，所以我们认为，不管是“初步”也好，或者是否已经“认识”了，但他总算是承认了“崇拜与宣扬武训”是“错误”而不是“正确”，这种最起码的转变，还是值得欢迎的。
    但是本文的作者对于他的错误的本质——他的思想，是怎样认识的呢？从这篇文章当中，我们很难找出作者对于他在《武训画传》中所表现的错误的思想的明确的分析，和自我批评，相反的，作者仅止在一些方法上作了一些与其是说“检讨”还不如说是掩饰的工作。
    作者在这篇文章开始对自己编写《武训画传》的错误认为主要是“非但对史料的批判不够深入，而且犯了严重的客观主义的错误。”这两句话就能够算是作者对于他的错误的“检讨”了吗？
    关于作者最严重的思想错误，在六月一日人民日报上张再学的《好名词掩盖下的坏思想》及本文的第一节都已有所分析，在这里我不拟多说。现在仅就作者的“检讨”，来看看究竟是否合乎事实吧。
    作者李先生在《武训画传》的“著者序”里面开宗明义地这样说道：“武训先生的反地主、反恶霸、反封建制度、反缠足、反迷信等进步思想，过去都一直无法表达出来，如今我们都予以阐明了。”这是作者在《武训画传》这本书里面的总的意图。按照作者的“检讨”，这也就是被他认为对史料批判得不够深入的地方，或者是被他认为“犯了严重的客观主义的错误”的地方。
    但是，作者对于“史料”是怎样进行“批判”的呢？从《武训画传》这部书本身来看，就是一个最好的说明：
    所谓“反地主”、“反恶霸”，武训在这些方面作了些什么呢？我们从武训的一生历史里面，找不出任何事实。我们除了看到武训对于地主恶霸的屈辱、投降、驯服的磕头以外，完全找不出什么“反”的意思来。就拿武训的最“伟大”的事业——“兴义学”来说吧，我们也可以说他几乎是全部依靠了地主阶级的。如武训讨饭讨来的钱存在地主那里，放高利贷，请地主出来替他主持义学的筹备工作，买地、盖房子等事都是委托地主阶级来经办，跪着请他们出来作校董，作教师；武训本人就这样挤上了缙绅、官僚、以及满清皇帝的反动统治的行列。这能够说是武训的“反抗”吗？
    当时的人民大众对于封建统治的反抗，才真正是轰轰烈烈，如火如荼的。如在武训生活的同一时间同一地点所进行的捻党起义的武装斗争，武训对此却不仅完全置身事外，无动于衷，而且还用着这种“义学”来浸蚀与麻痹群众的真正反抗，这能算是对“地主恶霸”的“反抗”吗？
    不仅如此，武训对于地主阶级，在思想上也是心悦诚服的。如在他的歌谣里面唱着：“只见好人盖高楼，没有恶霸行到头”，可见在他看来，那些“盖高楼”的，都一定是“好人”，盖高楼就一定是那大人先生们“积福”“行善”的报应。所谓恶霸，也不过是拿来作为一个抽象的陪衬而已，而且在他看来，所有不能够“行到头”的，就一定是“恶霸”了。他这个“好人”与“恶霸”的标准，就在于“盖高楼”上面，因此他对那些住着高楼大厦的“好人”，自然是爱戴信托的了。
    其次，作者说武训“反封建制度”，也是完全不合乎历史事实的。作为反对封建制度的最大最集中的表现，莫过于向封建统治阶级进行直接的斗争，企图从根本上推翻封建制度，解放在封建制度下被压迫的人民，这一点，和武训的思想及行为毫无联系可言。武训是一个封建制度的“具体的身体力行者”，他的兴办“义学”，不用说是以维持封建制度为目的的了，即如作为他晚年的第二职业的那种说媒拉纤的工作，就正是具体执行着“父母之命、媒约之言”的封建婚姻制度！其他如捐款给守节的妇女之类的事情，前面已经说过，这里便不多说了。
    从这些事实看来，就算是拿作为编者在“检讨”中特别提出的对于历史的态度和方法的自我批评来说，是否是正确的呢？我们觉得以上事实说明作者这种对历史的看法和提法，不仅没有进行“批判”而且是进行了极端无聊的掩饰，当然更谈不到“深刻”与不“深刻”了。同时作者对分析历史事实的方法也不是什么“客观主义”的问题，反倒是根据自己的偏见，任意将历史加上一些牵强附会的曲解。在这里我们首先要求李先生，在继续进行对自己错误思想的检讨以便达到进一步的更好的自我批评之前，首先认真地从各方面正视一下真正的历史，冷静地看一看客观事实，这是很必要的。
    最后，还要谈到的是作者在这篇文章里面，表现着似乎对陶行知先生提倡“武训精神”，认为还有它的积极意义，如作者这样说：“我肯定凡是因为受陶先生提倡‘武训精神’的熏陶而崇拜过武训的人，都有其积极性，”又说：“看过电影上的武训的人，一定造成他的混乱思想。这个责任在电影，而不能归之于陶先生。”
    这似乎是说：陶先生在提倡“武训精神”这件事情上是对的，受了陶先生的影响而跟着他提倡“武训精神”的人也是对的，因此所提倡的武训也并没有像电影上那样坏，只有电影是最要不得的了。
    这是极不正确的一种巧辩。电影上的错误，上文已经提到，并且在很多文章中已予以明确的批判，这里无须多说；就陶先生提倡“武训精神”这件事来说，人民日报上杨耳同志的文章也已作了极其透辟的分析，作者这种说法，正证明他是并没有很好的去理解的。
    作者化费很大的篇幅并且在行文上用异常感慨的口气来述说陶先生“因为提倡武训精神”而遭受到国民党匪帮的压迫，似乎是作者颇替陶先生及跟着他提倡武训的人抱委曲，想借陶先生一生的革命成就来洗刷他在提倡“武训精神”这一具体事件上所犯的错误，并且为跟着他提倡武训的人作辩护。
    这种态度也是很不好的。陶先生自有其不可磨灭的成就，正如杨耳同志所说的，主要的在于他不折不挠地向蒋匪帮斗争到底，而在提倡“武训精神”这一具体事件上则是“不洽当的”。那么从前曾经跟着陶先生提倡过武训的人，假如说里面有很多进步分子，我想那主要是因为受了陶先生革命的斗争精神的教育，而并不是因为受了陶先生提倡“武训精神”的“熏陶”而才有其“积极性”的。在这一点上，陶先生并不能替所有跟着他提倡武训的人作掩护工作，那些人也不可能因为自己曾经在思想上事业上受到陶先生的“教育”和“影响”，就连崇拜和宣扬武训的错误思想也变成“正确”的了。
    无疑地，电影《武训传》是有着严重错误的，但它的错误，还不在于像作者所认为的是在有些地方曲解了武训的为人，而主要的错误是以歌颂武训作为它的主题，自然，对于用武训的错误思想和行为去教育观众，使观众“造成混乱思想”，电影要负极大的责任。
    同时，不用电影而用画传去歌颂宣扬武训的错误思想和为人，同样定在读者中“造成思想混乱”，也同样要负极大的责任。更何况，在电影出现之前就已崇拜、宣扬、和提倡武训的人，在自己的错误思想与实践上，尤其应该更积极地正视自己的错误”，虚心地进行检讨，很好地学习在讨论电影《武训传》当中提出的正确的批评，以澄清自己的“混乱思想”。这一点对于作者李先生，我认为是十分必要的。
