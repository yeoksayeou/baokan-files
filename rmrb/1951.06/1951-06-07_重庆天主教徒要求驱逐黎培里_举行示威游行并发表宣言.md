Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 6th: Chongqing Catholics, opposing the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi's use of religion to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine the Chinese Catholics' patriotic reform movement, held a demonstration of over 500 people on the morning of the 3rd. On the afternoon of the same day, they held an expanded symposium and issued a declaration demanding the expulsion of Archbishop Riberi. Prior to this, Chongqing Catholics held symposiums, jointly wrote letters to comfort Nanjing Catholics, and encouraged them to hold accusation meetings and boldly expose all of Archbishop Riberi's crimes.

The demonstration on the morning of the 3rd demonstrated the determination of Chongqing Catholics to oppose the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi. More than 500 Catholics, led by Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing Diocese, and Father Chen Guangpu, marched along the streets chanting slogans such as "Demand that the People's Government severely punish the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi" and "Resolutely implement the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement." They were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. Christian, Buddhist, industrial, commercial, and medical groups organized welcome stations, first aid stations, and tea stations. The general public set off firecrackers to cheer them on.

A total of 363 people, including priests and lay Catholics, attended the expanded symposium. At the meeting, Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing Diocese, Tang Heqin, acting chairman of the preparatory committee of the Chongqing Catholic Study Group, Father Chen Guangpu, and lay representative Luo Rongcheng, among others, spoke, unanimously demanding that the People's Government severely punish Archbishop Riberi. The meeting passed a declaration opposing Archbishop Riberi's undermining of the Chinese Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement and interference in China's internal affairs. All 363 people signed the declaration on the spot. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

    The Catholics of Nanjing jointly issued a declaration on March 31, exposing the imperialists' conspiracy to use religion for aggression and expressing their determination to resolutely eliminate all imperialist forces and influences within the Chinese Church and implement the Three-Self principles of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance for Catholicism in China. This extremely reasonable and just proposition demonstrates the correct stance of Chinese Catholics in loving their motherland and their religion. It is not only the legitimate demand of the Nanjing Diocese but also the unanimous aspiration of all Chinese Catholics. However, Archbishop Riberi, a resident of Monaco and an imperialist element, under the cloak of religion, actually wrote letters to the bishops of various dioceses in China opposing this patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics.

    In his letters to the bishops, the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi attempted to convey his conspiracies and schemes to all Catholics, especially the Chinese clergy. This is clear evidence that he does not want Chinese Catholics to take the path of patriotic movements. He underestimated the strength of patriotic Chinese Catholics and still wants to pull us to the side of imperialism. The "grief" he refers to in his letter is the death throes of the imperialists. Because patriotic Catholics have stood up, the imperialists' trick of using religion for political conspiracies has been declared bankrupt. As for his saying that he was unaware of the declaration's formulation and cannot agree with it, it is an even more shameless and arrogant cry. The reform movement is an internal matter for Chinese patriotic Catholics themselves, and Archbishop Riberi has no right to interfere. He also said that the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement is a "trick of the enemy," clearly considering the Chinese people, including patriotic Catholics, and the People's Government as enemies of these imperialist elements. This is precisely the self-confession of imperialist elements. From now on, we must firmly stand on the position of the Chinese people and wage a merciless struggle against these imperialist elements.

    From the Wen Guibin case in Tianjin and a series of other incidents, we have recognized that imperialists use the church to interfere in China's internal affairs, and the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi is the executor of the imperialist countries' conspiracy to use religion to carry out political activities and sabotage. Archbishop Riberi's despicable tactics of alienating us patriotic Catholics from the entire people are absolutely intolerable! Patriotic Catholics across the country are extremely angry about this incident. We Catholics in the Chongqing Diocese are determined to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist element Archbishop Riberi and will not allow this kind of scum in the church to continue to use the church to carry out conspiratorial activities within our country's borders. We demand that the People's Government severely deal with this imperialist element Archbishop Riberi in accordance with the law.

    Archbishop Riberi's conspiratorial actions will not only fail to affect the Three-Self Reform of the Chinese Church but will, on the contrary, increase our awareness of the crimes of imperialists using Catholicism to invade China and interfere in China's internal affairs. We hope that patriotic Catholics across the country will unite, stand on the side of the people, use practical strength and actions to shatter the imperialists' conspiracies, and deeply develop the movement to resist America and aid Korea, severing all ties between the church and imperialism!

    Signatories: Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing Diocese; Father Chen Guangpu, Tang Zhiming, Yu Xueqian, Tan Lizhong, Wang Chengyi, Liu Renhui, Liu Zongyu, Dong Shizhi, Xia Jinxian; Cao Liangren, director of the Chongqing Ren'ai Tang Hospital; Tang Heqin, acting chairman of the preparatory committee of the Chongqing Catholic Study Group, and 363 others.

### 重庆天主教徒要求驱逐黎培里  举行示威游行并发表宣言

　　重庆天主教徒要求驱逐黎培里
    举行示威游行并发表宣言
    【新华社重庆六日电】重庆市天主教徒为反对帝国主义分子黎培里利用宗教干涉中国内政、破坏中国天主教徒爱国革新运动的侵略罪行，于三日上午举行了五百余人的示威游行；并于同日下午举行扩大座谈会，发表宣言，要求将黎培里驱逐出境。在这以前，重庆市天主教徒曾举行过座谈会，联名写信慰问南京教徒，并鼓励他们举行控诉大会，大胆揭露黎培里的一切罪行。
    在三日上午举行的示威游行，表现了重庆市天主教徒反对帝国主义分子黎培里的决心。五百多个教徒在天主教重庆教区代理主教石明亮和神甫陈光普等率领下，沿途高呼：“要求人民政府严办帝国主义分子黎培里”、“坚决实行三自革新运动”等口号。他们受到了各界人民的热烈欢迎，基督教、佛教和工商界、医药界的团体都组织了欢迎站、救护站或茶水站；广大市民并燃放鞭炮，为他们助威。
    参加扩大座谈会的有神甫、教徒等共三百六十三人。会上，天主教重庆教区代理主教石明亮、重庆市天主教徒学习会筹委会代理主任委员唐鹤琴、神甫陈光普、教徒代表罗蓉澄等都讲了话，一致要求人民政府严厉惩办黎培里。会上通过了反对黎培里破坏中国天主教三自革新运动、干涉中国内政的宣言。三百六十三人当场在宣言上签了名。该宣言全文如下：
    天主教南京教徒于三月三十一日联合发表宣言，揭露了帝国主义者利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋，表示要坚决肃清帝国主义在中国教会内的一切势力和影响，实行天主教在中国自养、自传、自治三大原则。这种极合理的正义主张，显示中国教徒爱祖国爱宗教的正确立场，不但是南京教区教徒们的正当要求，也是全中国教徒们一致的愿望。那知道摩纳哥侨民、帝国主义分子黎培里，在宗教外衣的障蔽下，竟写信给中国天主教各区主教，反对中国教徒们的这一爱国运动。
    帝国主义分子黎培里在给各区主教的信里，企图把他的阴谋诡计传达给一切教友们，尤其是中国神职班，这是他不让中国教徒走向爱国运动途径的一个明证。他低估了中国爱国教徒的力量，还想把我们拉向帝国主义的一边。他在信里所指的“悲痛”，就是帝国主义者垂死的哀鸣。由于爱国教徒们已站了起来，帝国主义利用宗教进行政治阴谋的伎俩已宣告破产。至于他说宣言制订时他未曾知悉，不能赞同此宣言，更是无耻的狂妄叫嚣。革新运动是中国爱国教徒自己内部的事，黎培里根本无权过问。他还说三自革新爱国运动是“敌人的诡计”，显然认为爱国天主教徒在内的中国人民和人民政府是他们这些帝国主义分子的敌人，这正是帝国主义分子的现身说法。今后我们要紧紧站稳中国人民的立场，同这些帝国主义分子作无情面的斗争。
    我们从天津文贵宾案件等一系列的事件中，认清了帝国主义利用教会干涉中国内政，帝国主义分子黎培里便是帝国主义国家利用宗教进行政治活动破坏阴谋的执行人。黎培里的这种要我们爱国教徒与全体人民为敌的分化的卑劣手段，是我们绝对不能容忍的！全国各地爱国教徒对此事件，激起了极大的愤怒，我们重庆教区的教徒，决定要和帝国主义分子黎培里作坚决斗争，不让教会内的这种败类再在我国的国土内利用教会进行阴谋活动。我们要求人民政府对这个帝国主义分子黎培里依法严加处理。
    黎培里的这一阴谋行动，不但不能影响中国教会的三自革新，相反地，更增加了我们对帝国主义者利用天主教侵略中国、干涉中国内政的罪行的认识。希望全国爱国教徒团结起来，站在人民的一边，用实际力量与行动粉碎帝国主义的诡计，深入开展抗美援朝运动，割断教会与帝国主义之间的一切关系！
    签名者：天主教重庆教区代理主教石明亮，神甫陈光普、唐智明、余学谦、覃立中、王沉毅、刘仁辉、刘宗渔、董世祉、夏进贤，重庆市仁爱堂医院院长曹良仁、重庆市天主教徒学习会筹委会代理主任委员唐鹤琴等三百六十三人。
