Communist Party members in some schools and factories in Beijing who had seen "The Life of Wu Xun" have enthusiastically launched discussions on the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and have been criticizing their own erroneous ideas in the discussions. The General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of the Beijing Machine General Factory used Party class time to give a report to all Party members criticizing Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Some Party groups also held discussions. The Communist Party Committee of the Beijing People's Printing Factory called on every Communist Party member in the factory to earnestly study the People's Daily editorial "The Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Taken Seriously." In order to enable everyone to truly solve ideological problems, the Party Committee collected some information about Wu Xun for everyone to refer to during the discussion. The General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of Peking University, in order to help everyone criticize the film "The Life of Wu Xun," reprinted the People's Daily editorial criticizing the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and other articles on the blackboard newspaper, and organized Communist Party members to participate in the school's discussion meetings and forums on the film "The Life of Wu Xun." The Communist Party branches of Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing Railway Institute, and Beijing Tram Company also held symposiums criticizing the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Many Communist Party members in the branches exposed their own misunderstandings of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" in the discussions or symposiums and criticized them.

	After watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," some Communist Party members once regarded Wu Xun as a "hero," saying "Wu Xun worked hard to run free schools for thirty years," "Wu Xun had the mind to sacrifice himself for others," and "Wu Xun had perseverance." Some individuals even defended Wu Xun when others criticized him, saying, "Wu Xun kowtowed to people, but this was for poor children, for the purpose of running free schools." Another group of Communist Party members, although they had some opinions after watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," such as saying that Wu Xun lacked a fighting spirit, still affirmed that Wu Xun was a "good person" in the end. Liu Pu, the propaganda committee member of the Communist Party branch of the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University, said: "After watching the film 'The Life of Wu Xun' at that time, although I was dissatisfied with Wu Xun's humble and ugly state, I felt that Wu Xun's spirit of running free schools was commendable." Some factory Communist Party members were dissatisfied when they saw Wu Xun's obsequiousness and strictly criticized the film "The Life of Wu Xun" as not a good film, not a film of the working people. However, a small number of Communist Party members were also misled by Wu Xun's "peasant status" and "running free schools for poor people," and also agreed to the unprincipled praise of the film "The Life of Wu Xun."

	Now, after preliminary analysis and research, everyone has affirmed that "The Life of Wu Xun" is a film that promotes reactionary ideas; it is a film that opposes the people's revolutionary struggle and advocates surrendering to the ruling class. At the same time, everyone examined the ideological roots of blindly praising Wu Xun at that time: some factory Communist Party members examined that the main reasons why they sympathized with and praised Wu Xun were "the theory of composition" and "the poor people's point of view," thinking that Wu Xun was a "poor man" and Wu Xun sacrificed himself to run free schools for poor children. Therefore, on the one hand, they were dissatisfied with Wu Xun's humble and servile appearance, and on the other hand, they praised Wu Xun as a "hero." Communist Party members from intellectual backgrounds examined that they had non-proletarian ideas, so they praised Wu Xun without principle. Although they have studied some Marxist-Leninist theory, they cannot combine it with practice, and when they encounter practical problems, they are confused and cannot solve them.

	These examinations are only a beginning, they are not profound, and some comrades still feel that Wu Xun's spirit of "self-sacrifice" and "thirty years as one day" is good, so further criticism is needed. Some branches are continuing to collect materials and preparing for further discussion.

	Some Communist Party organizations and Communist Party members have not actively organized or actively participated in the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Among them, some branches use the excuse that the higher authorities have not made arrangements; some branches use the excuse that the impression of watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is not deep, so there is no need to organize this discussion; even some more responsible Communist Party members once praised Wu Xun's spirit of hard work after watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and asked other Communist Party members to learn this spirit. But now they use the excuse of being busy with work and do not conduct a review. This fully shows that some Communist Party organizations and Communist Party members still have insufficient understanding of the fact that Communist Party members should actively participate in the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." This needs to be corrected.

　　北京市看过《武训传》的共产党员
    积极参加电影《武训传》的批判
    北京部分学校、工厂中看过《武训传》的共产党员，已热烈展开对《武训传》电影的讨论，并在讨论中批判自己的错误思想。北京机器总厂共产党总支委员会利用党课时间，向全体党员作了批判武训与《武训传》电影的报告，有些党的小组也就进行了讨论。北京人民印刷厂中共党委会，号召该厂的每个共产党员认真学习人民日报“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”的社论。党委为了使大家真正能够解决思想问题，搜集了一些有关武训的资料，供大家讨论时参考。北京大学共产党总支委员会为了帮助大家对电影《武训传》进行批判，特在壁报上转载了人民日报批判电影《武训传》的社论及其他文章，并组织共产党员参加校内的有关电影《武训传》的讨论会、座谈会。北方交通大学北京铁道学院、北京电车公司共产党支部也都先后召开了批判电影武训传的座谈会。各支部的许多共产党员，在讨论或座谈中，都揭露了自己对电影《武训传》的错误认识，并进行批判。有一部分共产党员在看了电影《武训传》后，曾一度把武训当作了“英雄”，所谓“武训三十年如一日，艰苦奋斗办义学”、“武训有着舍己为人的胸怀”、“武训有坚韧不拔的毅力”，甚至还有个别的人在别人批判武训时，还抱不平地为武训辩护，说：“武训是给人磕头跪拜了，但这是为了穷孩子，为了兴办义学。”另有一部分共产党员虽在看完电影《武训传》后，多少有些意见，例如说：武训缺乏斗争性；但最后仍肯定武训是个“好人”。北京大学东方语文系共产党支部宣传委员刘朴说：“我当时看完《武训传》电影后，虽然对武训的卑躬屈膝的丑态不满意，但又觉得武训兴办义学的精神可嘉”。一部分工厂共产党员在看到武训的卑躬屈膝时是不满意的，曾严格批判电影《武训传》不是一部好电影，不是劳动人民的电影。但也有少数共产党员被武训的“雇农成份”、“为穷人兴办义学”所迷惑，也同意对《武训传》电影的无原则的表扬。现在经过初步分析研究后，大家都肯定了《武训传》是一部宣传反动思想的电影；是一部反对人民革命斗争，而提倡向统治阶级投降的电影。同时大家又检查了当时盲目赞扬武训的思想根源：部分工厂共产党员检查自己所以同情与赞扬武训，主要是有“唯成份论”以及“穷人观点”，以为武训是个“穷人”，武训是牺牲自己，为穷家孩子兴办义学。因此一面是不满意武训卑躬屈膝的奴才相，而另一面却歌颂武训为“英雄”。知识分子出身的共产党员检查了自己有非无产阶级的思想，所以无原则地颂扬了武训。他们虽然学习了一些马克思列宁主义理论，但不能与实际结合，遇到实际问题，就迷惑了，不能解决了。
    这些检查还只是个开始，是不深刻的，并且还有个别同志仍觉得武训“舍己为人”“三十年如一日”的精神是好的，所以需要进一步批判。有些支部已在继续搜集材料，准备进一步讨论。
    有些共产党的组织和共产党员，还没积极组织或积极参加对电影《武训传》的批判。其中，有些支部是借口上级没有布置；有些支部是借口看过《武训传》电影印象不深，无需组织此项讨论；甚至有些比较负责的共产党员，也曾在看过《武训传》电影后，赞扬过武训的艰苦精神，并要其他共产党员学习这种精神。但现在却借口工作繁忙，不进行检讨。这充分地说明：有些共产党组织及共产党员，至今对共产党员应积极参加电影《武训传》的讨论认识不足。这是须要纠正的。
