The entire farmers of Wulizhai Village, Chenliu, Henan Province,
    Respond to the letter from the staff and workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    Resolving to sell the stored cotton and strive to eliminate insects to ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year
    After the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on cotton purchase and storage, all the staff and workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory wrote a letter to the farmer brothers across the country (the original letter appeared in this newspaper on June 15), calling on them to sell their stored cotton to the state or store it with the state. After seeing this letter, all the farmers of Wulizhai Village, Chenliu County, Henan Province, immediately discussed the work of selling and storing cotton. Everyone unanimously decided to respond to the call of the worker brothers and wrote a reply letter to all the staff and workers of the factory. The original letter is as follows. To the older brothers, all staff and workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory:
    We have received your letter. Our village does not have much stored cotton, and it has all been ginned before the wheat harvest, twisted into strands, ready for spinning thread after the wheat harvest. Now that we hear the country needs cotton, especially after receiving your letter, we have decided to take it all out and sell it to the state.
    This year, our village has planted a total of 140 mu of cotton (more than double that of last year), and it is now generally infested with aphids. Some individual farmers, seeing no hope of harvest, are planning to plow it up and plant other crops instead. After reading your letter, in order to repay your concern and kindness, and to ensure the supply of raw materials to the factory, we have not only decided to keep it, but also to do everything possible to ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year. Yesterday, all the men and women in our village were mobilized to boil Mao Yan, Liang Gen, and lime with water, and sprinkle it on the cotton seedlings with insects. This can kill the insects. If this application does not kill all the insects, we plan to spray it again in a few days. In previous years, cotton fields were hoed only three or two times, but this year they have already been hoed twice, and we guarantee to hoe them three more times. And we also guarantee that all the cotton harvested in the autumn will be sold to the state.
    The new-style plow produced by your factory is already owned by the Wang Zide mutual aid team in our village. Everyone sees that he is using it very skillfully, and five new mutual aid teams have been organized in the village, all preparing to buy one. You said you want to strive to reduce costs, then we may buy a few more. As long as the farm tools are good and there is plenty of fertilizer, and we further improve our farming techniques, the crops will be abundant, and our lives will be better.
    You workers use machines and manufacture new-style farm tools for us farmers, which is more advanced than us farmers. We hope you will write more letters to give us guidance in the future.
    Finally, let me tell you some good news: more than 60 households in our village originally planned to donate 200,000 yuan in the first phase to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army (and planned to donate another phase after the autumn harvest). When everyone reported yesterday at the meeting, they reported more than 800,000 yuan, more than four times the planned amount. You see: under the leadership of the Communist Party, we farmers are also progressing.
    We hope you will produce more new farm tools for us to use.
            All farmers of Wulizhai Village, Chenliu, Henan, June 20th

　　河南陈留五里砦村全体农民
    函复华北农业机械总厂职工
    决售出存棉并努力除虫保证今年棉花丰收
    华北农业机械总厂全体职工在中央人民政府政务院发布关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，曾写信给全国农民兄弟（原信见六月十五日本报），号召他们把自己的存棉售给国家或向国家储存。河南省陈留县五里砦村全体农民见到这封信后，马上讨论了售棉储棉工作。大家一致要响应工人兄弟的号召，并给该厂全体职工写了回信。原信如下。华北农业机械总厂全体职工老大哥：
    您们给俺的信，俺看到了。俺庄存棉不多，而且都已经在麦前弹好，搓成条子，准备麦后纺线。现在听说国家需要棉花，特别是收到你们来信以后，我们决定都把它拿出来卖给国家。
    今年俺村共种了一百四十亩棉花（比去年增加了一倍还多），现在普遍生腻虫。个别农民眼看收成无望，正打算把它犁掉改种旁的作物。看了你们的信以后，为了报答你们的关心和好意，保证供给工厂原料，我们不但已经决定把它保留下来，而且决定要想尽办法，保证今年棉花丰收。昨天，我们全村男女已经动员起来，用毛砚、良根和石灰加水熬熬，洒在有虫的花苗上。这样可以把虫杀死。如果洒了这一遍虫杀不完，停几天我们还准备再洒一次。往年棉花地只锄三两遍，今年已经锄了二遍，保证再锄三遍。并且我们还保证：到秋后把收获的全部棉花都卖给国家。
    你们厂里出的新式犁，俺庄王自德互助组已经有了一具。大家看他使的很得劲，全村又新组织了五个互助组，都准备买一具。你们说要争取减低成本，那么，我们还可能多买几具。只要农具好、粪多，俺们再提高耕作技术，农作物就会丰产，咱们的日子也就会更好过了。
    你们工人使机器，又制造新式农具给俺农民用，比俺农民进步。希望你们今后多来信指教。
    最后，再告诉你们一个好消息：俺庄六十多户，原来打算第一期捐献二十万元购买飞机大炮，支援志愿军（打算秋后还捐一期）。昨天开会时大家一报，就报了八十多万元，超过预定数四倍还多。你看：在共产党领导下，俺农民也进步了。
    希望你们多生产一些新农具给俺使。
            河南陈留五里砦全体农民六月二十日
