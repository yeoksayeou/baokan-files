Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Tehran: Tehran: On May 29th—the eighteenth anniversary of the signing of the oil agreement between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Iranian government—100,000 citizens of Tehran, the capital of Iran, held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration. The banners held by the demonstrators read: "The oil company has robbed Iran for fifty years. It should be confiscated immediately!", "If the British don't get out, we will drive them into the sea!", "Beware! The United States is not sympathetic to us, it wants to take the place of Britain!". The demonstrators sang patriotic songs against imperialism along the way, and shouted: "Drive out British and American imperialism!" "We will crush foreign exploiters with iron fists!"

On the 30th, 15,000 citizens of Tehran continued to hold demonstrations. When the procession passed the gates of the British and American embassies, they shouted slogans against British and American imperialism. The placards they held showed a picture of an Iranian worker throwing the British and Americans into the sea. The demonstrating masses also held rallies. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the United States is trying to annex the whole world. They unanimously demanded that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the American oil industry in Bahrain be immediately nationalized. The conference finally passed a resolution, firmly demanding that the Iranian oil industry be nationalized, condemning American and British imperialism, and demanding that the Iranian government respect democratic freedoms and remove martial law in the Khuzestan oil region. Demonstrations of the same nature were also held in other Iranian cities.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Tehran: According to TASS, Tehran: On May 29, many newspapers in Tehran protested against the memorandum of the US Ambassador Grady, who was protecting the British. "Kahe News" said: The memorandum put forward by Grady is a knife inserted in Iran's back. "Sedali News" pointed out: The US statement that it does not interfere in Iranian affairs is hypocritical. The newspaper emphasized that the US memorandum itself is already a brutal interference in Iran's internal affairs. "Bisu Ayandi News" commented on Grady's memorandum, saying: The United States is interested in: stabilizing imperialist rule in Iran, plundering Iranian wealth, infringing upon Iran's freedom, independence and sovereignty, and seizing the rights and interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company; according to the shameless logic of American diplomats, these are the "foundations of the unity of the free world (i.e., the imperialist bloc)."

　　驱逐英美帝国主义、要求石油国有化
    伊朗首都十万人民反帝大示威
    德黑兰报纸痛斥美国干涉内政的阴谋
    【新华社一日讯】德黑兰讯：五月二十九日——英伊石油公司和伊朗政府石油协定签字的十八周年纪念日，伊朗首都德黑兰市民十万人举行了一个规模空前的大示威游行。示威者手拿的旗帜上面写着：“石油公司已在伊朗抢劫了五十年。现在应该立即把它没收！”，“如果英国人不滚蛋，我们就把他们赶到海里去！”，“当心！美国并不是同情我们的，它想取得代替英国的地位！”。示威者沿途唱着反对帝国主义的爱国歌曲，并高呼：“把英、美帝国主义赶出去！”“我们将用铁拳粉碎外国剥削者！”
    三十日，德黑兰市民一万五千人继续举行示威游行。游行队伍走过英、美大使馆的门口时，喊着反对英、美帝国主义的口号，他们举着的标语牌上，画着一个伊朗工人把英国人和美国人丢下海去的图画。示威群众并举行集会，在会上发言的人们指出：美国正企图吞并全世界。他们一致要求把英伊石油公司及美国在巴林群岛的石油工业，立即收归国有。大会最后通过决议，坚决要求把伊朗石油工业收归国有，痛斥美、英帝国主义，并要求伊朗政府尊重民主自由，撤除库齐斯坦石油区的戒严令。伊朗其他城市也举行了同样性质的示威游行。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰讯：五月二十九日，德黑兰很多报纸均著文抗议美国大使格拉第袒护英国的备忘录。《喀赫报》说：格拉第提出的备忘录，是插在伊朗背上的刀子。《塞达利报》指出：美国声明不干涉伊朗事务是虚伪的。该报强调说：美国的备忘录本身就已经是对伊朗内政的横暴干涉。《比苏·阿扬第报》评论格拉第的备忘录时说：美国感到兴趣的是：稳定伊朗境内的帝国主义统治，掠夺伊朗的财富，侵害伊朗的自由、独立和主权以及夺取英伊石油公司的权益；按照美国外交官的无耻逻辑，这些就是“自由世界（按即帝国主义集团）统一的基础”。
