The Taiji Shaft project of the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau, under the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, commenced in July 1950. Due to extreme difficulties encountered during construction, it was forced to halt operations in April of this year, resulting in significant losses. The Taiji Shaft was a key capital construction project of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration in 1950. The shaft is located between the Xiaoling River and Ganhezi River in Beipiao County, a long-standing riverbed. Before construction, a design was created based on the planned depth, location, and annual production. It specified a shaft diameter of five meters, a two-meter-thick concrete collar at the wellhead, and a 25-ton headframe. The geological characteristics of the construction site were: abundant yellow clay and yellow sandy clay, with a layer of river sand over a meter thick, and loose soil. Under these special geological conditions, the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau actually proceeded with construction using the lagging method, following a general design process. This lagging method is more suitable for areas with hard soil and abundant rocks. If this method is used in areas with loose soil, it will increase the pressure around the shaft opening (the upper part of the shaft already had a pressure of 620 tons), making it easier for water and loose soil to seep into the shaft. Therefore, on the fifth day after drilling began on August 29th of last year, the wooden rings of the shaft were found to be bending downward. The mine continued to excavate after reinforcing the support of the shaft. On September 4th, at a depth of 6.6 meters, a large amount of thin mud was found to be gushing out from the bottom of the shaft. Immediately, a row of short wooden piles about one meter long was driven around the bottom of the shaft to prevent the thin mud from flowing out. However, on September 5th, circular cracks were found on the ground around the shaft opening, indicating the risk of the concrete collar sinking completely, that is to say, the wellhead was in danger of complete collapse. At this point, excavation was stopped to find a way to salvage the situation. In this way, work was forced to stop three times to study remedial measures. But the deeper they went, the more difficulties they encountered. Finally, when they reached 16.72 meters, a large amount of yellow mud gushed out, exceeding the speed at which the buckets could lift it. After all salvage measures failed, the project had to be declared a failure.

Shaft construction is an extremely complex undertaking. Before design and construction, it is essential to understand the historical conditions of the site, conduct geological and soil tests, and carry out thorough exploration drilling. Only then can a design be created and a construction method be determined based on these specific conditions. Without these steps, it is impossible to understand the difficulties that may arise during the project, and errors are inevitable. The main reason for the failure of the Taiji Shaft project of the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau lies in the lack of thorough engineering design work. Of course, the mine had conducted some exploration drilling before construction, but these were not carefully studied and analyzed, and the historical conditions of the Beipiao project were not investigated. The Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau had a lot of experience in sinking shafts in the past. For example, the Nanshan ventilation shaft of the Beipiao Mine was a new shaft sunk during the puppet Manchurian regime, which took more than two years. Initially, the general lagging method was used, and only a dozen meters were excavated in a year and a half, eventually making it impossible to continue excavating. Later, the method was changed to concrete caissons (that is, concrete rings were made around the shaft opening, and concrete rings were added on top of the concrete rings as excavation progressed until the bottom of the shaft was reached), and the project was successfully completed. The old workers of the Beipiao Mine knew these experiences in detail. However, the mine did not conduct a survey of the workers, which led to the error. Secondly, the leading cadres and technical personnel of the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau committed the mistake of being eager for quick success in carrying out this project. During the design process, they already felt that their understanding of the coal reserves and geological conditions was insufficient, and that it was necessary to conduct further exploration, but they finally proceeded with construction rashly. Connected to the idea of being eager for quick success was an extremely careless attitude towards this project. The leading cadres of the mine, on the one hand, felt that they did not understand technology, but on the other hand, they let things drift from preparation and arrangement to construction, and even failed to summarize experience in a timely manner after accidents occurred.

After the Taiji Shaft project of the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau was suspended in April of this year, re-exploration and investigation work has been carried out. The failure of the Taiji Shaft of the Beipiao Coal Mine Bureau not only provides a painful lesson in shaft sinking projects, but also has extremely important educational significance for general capital construction projects.

　　设计前没有调查研究和详细探钻        
    北票煤矿台吉竖井工程完全失败        
    该矿正在重新进行勘查工作
    东北煤矿管理局所属北票煤矿矿务局台吉竖井工程，自一九五○年七月开工，由于施工中遇到极大困难，今年四月已被迫停工，损失至为巨大。台吉竖井是一九五○年东北煤矿管理局基本建设主要工程之一。竖井位于北票县小凌河及干河子之间，这是多年的老河底。施工以前，根据计划要求的深度、位置、年产量，进行了设计。规定井口直径为五公尺，井上置二公尺厚的洋灰锁口及二十五吨的井架。施工地点地质的特点是：黄粘泥和黄砂泥多，并有一层一公尺多厚的河流砂，土质松软。在这样的特殊的地质情况下，北票煤矿矿务局竟按着一般设计的程序，用架圈的方法，进行施工。这种架圈的方法，在土质硬及多岩石的地方比较适当。如果在地质虚松之处亦采用这方法，将加大井口旁压力（该井上部已有六百二十吨重量的压力），使水和松土更易渗入井内。因此，在去年八月二十九日开始凿井后的第五日，即发现井筒的木圈向下弯曲。矿方在加强井筒的支撑力后，仍继续掘进。九月四日，掘至六点六公尺处，又发现井底涌出大量稀泥，随即在井底周围，打一排约一公尺长的短木桩，以阻止稀泥外涌。可是九月五日，在地面上井口周围，已发现有环形裂纹，证明洋灰锁口有全部下沉的危险，即是说井口有完全陷落的危险，这时才停止掘进，想法挽救。就这样三次被迫停工，以研究补救办法。但越往下作困难愈多，最后进到十六点七二公尺时，黄泥大量涌出，其数量超过吊桶提升的速度。一切挽救办法失败之后，该工程乃不得不宣告失败。
    竖井是极复杂的建设工程，设计施工前一定要了解该地历史情况，要做地质、土质的试验和周密的探钻，然后才能针对着这些具体情况，进行设计，和决定施工的方法。没有这些工作，就不可能了解工程中有什么困难，就必然发生错误。北票煤矿矿务局台吉竖井工程上失败的原因主要即在于没有周密的工程设计工作。当然，在施工之前，该矿也作了一些探钻工作，但未仔细的研究和分析，对于北票工程历史情况也没有进行调查。北票矿务局在过去有很多打竖井的经验，如北票矿南山排风井是伪满时打的新井，历时两年余，开始也是用一般架圈的方法，一年半只打了十几公尺，终于无法掘进。后改为洋灰沉圈（即在井口周围做洋灰圈，再向下挖时，洋灰圈上面再加洋灰圈，一直到挖到井底为止），就顺利地完成了工程。这些经验北票矿的老工人知道得很详细。但该矿没有向工人作调查，致造成错误。其次，北票矿矿务局的领导干部和技术人员在进行这一工程时，犯了急于求成的错误，在进行设计时，已经感到对煤的埋藏量和地质情况了解不足，有再进行勘查的必要，但终于冒然施工。与急于求成的思想相连的，是对这一工程的极不慎重的态度。该矿领导干部一面认为自己不懂技术，但在另一方面，则从准备布置到施工，都听其自流，甚至在发生事故后亦未及时总结经验。
    北票矿矿务局台吉竖井工程在今年四月停工之后，已重新进行探钻勘查工作。北票矿矿务局台吉竖井的失败，不仅给开凿竖井工程上给了可痛的教训，对一般的基本建设工程，也有极其重要的教育意义。
