Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The agonizing helplessness of the American imperialists regarding the future of the Korean War has recently been manifested in the testimony of Wedemeyer, the former vanguard of American aggression against China, before the Senate. Following Acheson, Wedemeyer testified from the 11th to the 13th at the joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees investigating MacArthur's dismissal, wailing that if the war continues as it is, the Korean War is a "bottomless pit," and "there is no hope of victory for the United Nations (which should be read as the American aggressors and their accomplices)." He also said, "Many American youths have sacrificed their lives in Korea," without being able to "achieve any results there." Wedemeyer was particularly worried that the Korean War would exhaust America's strength to carry out aggression around the world. He said in a hoarse voice: "We have obligations in Europe (which should be read as aggressive plans), and we may also have to fulfill some obligations elsewhere. If we continue to pour our strength into Korea, ... we will not be able to fulfill ... obligations of greater importance to us." Wedemeyer therefore despairingly proposed that the U.S. Army should withdraw from Korea, while also daydreaming about using the Air Force and Navy to achieve the U.S.'s goals of aggression against Korea.

　　魏德迈发出哀鸣        
    承认侵朝战争是个“无底洞”
    【新华社十七日讯】美帝国主义者对侵朝战争前途束手无策的苦闷，最近又从前美国侵华急先锋魏德迈在参议院的作证中表现出来。魏德迈继艾奇逊之后，于十一日至十三日在参议院外交与军事两委员会调查麦克阿瑟撤职事件的联席会议上作证时哀号：照目前这样打下去，朝鲜战争是一个“无底洞”，“看不到联合国（应读作美国侵略者及其帮凶们）有胜利的希望”。他又说：“许多美国青年在朝鲜牺牲了生命”，而不能“在那里有什么结果”。魏德迈特别担心朝鲜战争会耗尽美国在全世界进行侵略的力量。他声嘶力竭地说：“我们在欧洲有义务（应读为有侵略计划），我们可能也必须在其他地方尽一些义务，如果我们继续把力量投入朝鲜，……我们就不能履行……对我们有更大重要性的义务了。”魏德迈因此绝望地提出美国陆军应撤出朝鲜，同时痴人说梦似地主张用空军与海军，来达到美国侵略朝鲜的目的。
