Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 13th: According to TASS, the fifteenth anniversary of the death of the great Soviet revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky is on the 18th. The Soviet government specially erected a bronze statue of Gorky in the square in front of the Belorussky Railway Station in Moscow. The unveiling ceremony of the statue was held on the 10th, attended by thousands of writers, scientists, and representatives from all walks of life. Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, said in his speech: Gorky's works have had a profound impact on hundreds of millions of working people. His contribution to shaping the character of today's Soviet people and to inspiring and cultivating the finest revolutionary qualities of working people around the world is unparalleled. Gorky was a new type of writer who linked his destiny with the Bolshevik Party. He constantly attacked fascism, hypocritical bourgeois democracy, and all forms of racial and national oppression, inflicting significant blows on them. Gorky's resounding call to defend peace and oppose a new world war still rings around the world like an alarm bell today.
    The Soviet people are preparing to hold exhibitions, recitations of Gorky's works, and performances of his plays. The Soviet Academy of Sciences began a five-day All-Union Conference in memory of Gorky on the 11th, attended by writers, artists, and literary critics from Moscow, Leningrad, and other places. The conference agenda includes: "Gorky's Influence on World Literature," "Gorky and Bulgarian Literature," "Gorky's Works in Czechoslovakia," and other special reports.
    In the past thirty years, Gorky's works have been published in 71 languages in the Soviet Union in 2,000 editions, with a total of over 58 million copies. The first eight volumes of the thirty-volume Complete Works of Gorky have been published, with 300,000 copies of each volume printed.

    苏联人民正筹备举办展览会、高尔基作品的朗诵会，和演出他的剧作。苏联科学院于十一日起举行为期五天的纪念高尔基的全苏会议，出席的有莫斯科、列宁格勒和各地的作家、艺术家和文艺批评家多人。会议议程包括：“高尔基对世界文学的影响”、“高尔基和保加利亚文学”、“高尔基的著作在捷克斯洛伐克”，以及其他专题报告。
