Xinhua News Agency, June 20th—American imperialists are extremely frustrated by the results of the French parliamentary elections on June 17th. They painfully see that the Communist Party, which they had painstakingly tried to eliminate in this election, still enjoys the broadest support of the French people. Their darling, de Gaulle, remains powerless to take over the government, the new National Assembly is even more difficult to manipulate, and the reactionary French regime remains unstable.

The U.S. State Department spokesman openly revealed this sentiment when commenting on the French election results on the 18th. He said: "De Gaulle's votes show strength, however, it is certainly not as much as de Gaulle originally hoped for." He anxiously hoped that the French "National Assembly could form a stable government as soon as it reconvenes." But he had to admit: "There will be serious difficulties in forming a coalition government (referring to a coalition government of various reactionary parties)."

The American imperialist news agencies—United Press and Associated Press—also acknowledged that "the Communist Party is still the largest party in France" and regretted that de Gaulle had not succeeded. A United Press dispatch from Paris on the 18th reluctantly admitted that de Gaulle "did not get the results he expected in this election. The number of seats his Rally of the French People won in the final results of the elections in France and North Africa is far less than the 180 seats it expected. The number of votes it received in the French people's vote is still less than that of the Communist Party, de Gaulle's mortal enemy, which is the largest party in France."

Charles Follett, the European director of United Press, sent dispatches from Paris on the 18th and 19th, worrying about whether the U.S. war preparation policy could be smoothly implemented in the new French parliament. Follett said: "According to the election results, no political group can occupy a decisive position of importance in the new National Assembly." "The stalemate in the parliament is worse than in the old parliament." This is because: "First, the ruling parties of the original coalition government cannot effectively manipulate the parliament," and they have to spend a lot of effort to form an alliance with the so-called "fourth force" to maintain its rule; "Second, de Gaulle's party is still far from becoming a majority; third, the votes obtained by the Communist Party still maintain a considerable level." Therefore, "the future government of France is unstable. In the near future, it is likely that those who have been struggling to rule France will continue to try to maintain the crumbling coalition government." This situation made Follett sigh: the new government "will not be stronger than the old government," and it "may encounter trouble from communist workers at home"; and in international affairs, for example, in the Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference and the rearmament of West Germany, whether it can "take a more active" attitude to "break the deadlock before the election" as the United States requires is "very questionable."

### 法共获得最广大选民拥护  美帝国主义极为惊慌

　　法共获得最广大选民拥护
    美帝国主义极为惊慌
    【新华社二十日讯】对于六月十七日法国议会选举的结果，美国帝国主义者感到极大的懊丧。他们痛苦地看到：他们用尽心计企图在这次大选中予以排除的共产党，现在仍然得到法国人民最广大的拥护，而他们的宠儿戴高乐却仍然无力包办政权，新的国民议会甚至更难操纵，法国的反动政权依然是不稳的。
    美国国务院发言人十八日就法国选举结果发表谈话时，公开透露了这种心情。他说：“戴高乐得到的选票显示了力量，然而，当然不及戴高乐原来所希望的那样多”。他无限焦急地希望：法国“国民议会一复会，就马上能成立一个稳定的政府”。可是他又不得不承认：“要成立联合政府（按指各反动党派的联合政府），将有严重困难。”
    美帝国主义的通讯社—合众社与美联社也承认“共产党仍是法国的第一大党”，并且痛惜戴高乐没有能够成功。合众社巴黎十八日电无可奈何地承认：戴高乐“在这次选举中并没有得到他所预期的结果。他的法兰西人民联盟在法国和北非选举的最后结果中所得到的席次，远不及它所预期的一百八十席。它在法国人民投票中所得到的票数仍不及戴高乐死敌的法国最大政党共产党。”
    合众社欧洲分社主任沙可福十八日、十九日从巴黎发出的电讯，忧虑美国备战政策能否在法国新议会中顺利推行下去。沙可福说：“根据大选结果，没有任何政治集团能在新的国民议会中占有决定性的重要地位”。“议会中的僵持状态比旧议会还糟糕”。这是因为：“第一，原联合政府各执政党集团都不能有力地操纵议会”，而要花很大力气来和所谓“第四种力量”结成联盟，才能维持它的统治；“第二，戴高乐党要成为多数还差得很远；第三，共产党所得的选票仍然保持着相当高的水平”。因此，“法国今后的政府是不稳定的。最近将来，可能还是由那些一直在勉力统治法国的人继续设法维持摇摇欲坠的联合政府”。这种情形，使得沙可福不禁悲叹：新政府“并不会比旧政府强”，它“在国内可能遭遇共产党工人的麻烦”；而在国际方面，例如在四外长助理会议与重新武装西德的问题上，是否能够像美国所要求的那样，“采取比较积极”的态度去“打开选举前所陷入的僵局”，还“很成问题”。
