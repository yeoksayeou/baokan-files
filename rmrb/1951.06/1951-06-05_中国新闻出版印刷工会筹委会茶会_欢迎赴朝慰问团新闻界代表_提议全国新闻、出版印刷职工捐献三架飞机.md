Xinhua News Agency, June 4th—The Preparatory Committee of the China National News, Publishing and Printing Industry Union held a tea party today to welcome the news representatives and all journalists of the Chinese People's Delegation to Comfort North Korea. Director Fan Changjiang, Deputy Director Ye Shengtao, and news figures such as Sa Kongliao, Liu Zunqi, and Huan Xiang attended the tea party. In his welcoming speech, Fan Changjiang said: The news workers who participated in the delegation have already done meaningful work at the front lines of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. After returning to China, in addition to continuing to participate in the delegation's reports on the front line situation throughout the country, they should write more, reporting to the people of the country on the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and their lofty patriotism and internationalism, to inspire the people of the country; at the same time, they should fully report on the patriotic movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea and support the front lines, to inspire the soldiers at the front. Li Furen (former head of the Xi'an Laobaixing [Old Common People] Newspaper), head of the first sub-delegation; Wang Wenbin (manager of the Chongqing Dagongbao [L'Impartial] newspaper), head of the second sub-delegation; and Xu Zhucheng, representative of Shanghai news workers, all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously agreed that participating in the work of the delegation this time made them deeply feel the greatness and supreme glory of the motherland, and expressed their willingness to take on the reporting work of inspiring the military and civilians at the front and rear, especially to find ways to meet the needs of the soldiers at the front. Subsequently, Deputy Director Ye Shengtao proposed: call on national news, publishing, and printing workers to respond to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and donate three airplanes. Sa Kongliao also proposed that books and newspapers should be donated to the Volunteer Army to improve the supply of spiritual food at the front. Li Furen immediately expressed his willingness to work hard on writing, and donate all of his manuscript fees to purchase airplanes before the final victory in the war to resist America. Hu Xingyuan, a reporter for the Shanghai Xinwen Ribao [News Daily], prepaid one million yuan in manuscript fees. Representatives of the news circles in Northwest China, Chongqing and other places all expressed that they would do their best to promote this donation work in various places. As for the specific donation methods, the association will discuss them in detail before issuing a notice.
