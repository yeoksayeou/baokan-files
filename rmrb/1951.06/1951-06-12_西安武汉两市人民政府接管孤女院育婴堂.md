The Xi'an and Wuhan Municipal People's Governments
Take Over Orphanages and Foundling Homes

Xi'an Municipal People's Government, in response to the demands of the broad masses of people in the city, formally took over the Catholic Church Orphanage in the city (also known as the "Xi'an Catholic Church Tangfang Street Baochi Society") on the 7th of this month. The main criminals who had harmed the children in the orphanage, former director Mu Haihan, current director Xia Yiji, and accomplice Sister Gao Huixian (all of whom are Chinese nationals), have been handed over to the Municipal People's Court for legal proceedings.

The orphanage is an affiliated organization of the Xi'an Catholic Church, founded in 1932. For the past nineteen years, the orphanage has, under the guise of "charity" and "relief," cruelly abused the orphans it took in. According to the so-called "orphan registration forms" recently handed over by Xia Yiji, from 1932 to February 19, 1951, a total of 317 orphans were admitted; 76 were abused to death, 115 are missing, 53 have unknown whereabouts (only noted as being taken away by someone, making investigation impossible), 47 have recorded whereabouts (still requiring investigation), and only 26 orphans remain in the orphanage. This so-called "orphan registration form" was hastily created by Xia Yiji and others under repeated urging from the relief branch, and the actual number of orphans who were abused to death is likely far more than the above figures. The orphans remaining in the orphanage are sallow and emaciated, and according to doctors' examinations, all suffer from malnutrition, with one five-month-old orphan weighing only four kilograms. And the orphans who were fortunate enough to grow up were sold off by the orphanage as commodities.

Before the Xi'an Municipal People's Government took over the orphanage, the broad masses of people in the city had expressed great anger at the orphanage's crimes of abusing children, and local newspapers and radio stations had successively received written opinions from 3,119 people and 270 organizations, unanimously demanding that the Municipal People's Government immediately take over the orphanage and punish the criminals who abused and killed children according to law. The Consultative Committee of the Xi'an Municipal People's Representative Conference also organized an investigation team to conduct an investigation into the orphanage. After the investigation confirmed the facts, the Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the demands of the people from all walks of life, specially dispatched Ding Zhiming, Director of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, along with representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and religious circles, to take over the orphanage, announced its renaming as the "Xi'an Liberation Nursery," and appointed Wei Hongtao, Secretary-General of the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Administration, as the concurrent director of the orphanage, and Jing Jiyun, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Municipal People's Nursery, as the concurrent deputy director of the orphanage.

After the takeover, people from all walks of life visited the orphanage to comfort the suffering orphans. The trade union of the Anduo Hospital of the Catholic Church and other organizations also organized a delegation to bring various children's toys and candies to congratulate the rescued orphans in the orphanage.

Xinhua News Agency - Wuhan: The Wuhan Municipal People's Government, accepting the demands of the people from all walks of life, formally entrusted the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Administration and the Wuhan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation on the 4th of this month to take over the Wuchang Garden Mountain Catholic Church Foundling Home, which had killed more than 16,000 Chinese infants, and formally renamed it the "Wuhan Municipal Nursery." At the same time, the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau has arrested Guo Shiji, the American bishop of the Catholic Wuchang Diocese, and Xu Laide, the American deputy bishop, the main culprits in the killing of Chinese children, and is preparing to severely punish them according to law.

Before the formal takeover, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Relief Branch, and the Democratic Women's Federation sent staff to the church to take care of the children's lives and treat sick infants. In more than a month, sixteen infants suffering from serious illnesses have been rescued. People from all walks of life are very concerned about these rescued little lives and surviving children, and more than 80,000 people have visited them in more than a month, and have given them a large number of gifts and nearly 20 million yuan in condolences.

　　西安武汉两市人民政府        
    接管孤女院育婴堂
    西安市人民政府在该市广大人民要求下，已于本月七日正式接管该市天主堂孤女院（又名“西安天主堂糖坊街保赤会”）。曾残害该院儿童的主要罪犯前任院长穆海涵、现任院长夏益济及帮凶修道女高慧仙三人（都是中国籍），已交由市人民法院依法审办。
    该院系西安天主教堂附属机关之一，创办于一九三二年。十九年来，该院假借“慈善”、“救济”名义，残酷虐害所收容的孤女。仅据夏益济最近交出的所谓“孤女登记表格”所载，从一九三二年到一九五一年二月十九日止，共收孤女三百一十七名；被虐杀致死的有七十六人，无下落的有一百一十五人，下落不明者（仅填注某人领去字样，无法调查的）五十三人，填有下落者（还须进行调查的）四十七人，在院孤女现仅有二十六人。这个所谓“孤女登记表格”，是在救济分会一再催促下，夏益济等无法推诿才仓促造出的，实际上被虐害致死的孤女，当远不止以上数字。留在院内的孤女面黄肌瘦，据医生检查，都患营养不良症，其中一个五个月的孤女体重只有四公斤。而侥幸长大的孤女就被院方当作商品卖掉。
    在西安市人民政府接管该院以前，该市广大人民对于该院虐害儿童的罪恶，已表示了极大愤怒，当地报纸和广播电台曾先后收到三千一百一十九人和二百七十个单位的书面意见，一致要求市人民政府立即接管该院，并依法惩治该院虐杀儿童的罪犯。市各界人民代表会议协商委员会并曾组织调查团去该院进行调查。经调查属实后市人民政府根据各界人民的要求，特派市民政局局长丁志明，会同各民主党派、人民团体及宗教界代表接管该院，宣布改名为“西安市解放育幼院”，并委任中国人民救济总会西安分会秘书长魏洪涛兼任该院院长，西安市人民保育院副院长荆纪芸兼任该院副院长。
    在接管以后，各界人民纷纷前往该院参观，慰问受难孤女。天主堂安多医院工会等单位并组织了慰问团，携带各种儿童玩具和糖果等，向该院被拯救的孤女们致贺。
    武汉市人民政府接受各界人民要求，已于本月四日委托中国人民救济总会武汉市分会和武汉市民主妇女联合会正式接管曾残杀中国婴儿达一万六千余名的武昌花园山天主堂育婴堂，并正式命名为“武汉市育幼院”。与此同时，武汉市公安局已将残杀中国儿童的主要凶手，天主教武昌教区美籍主教郭时济、美籍副主教徐赉德拘捕到案，准备依法予以严惩。
    在正式接管前，市卫生局、救济分会和民主妇女联合会曾派出工作人员，至该堂照料儿童生活，救治病婴。在一个多月中，有十六个患严重疾病的婴儿已被救治过来。各界人民对于这些被抢救过来的小生命和幸存的儿童非常关心，一个多月内有八万多人去看望过他们，并送给他们大批慰问品和将近二千万元的慰问金。
