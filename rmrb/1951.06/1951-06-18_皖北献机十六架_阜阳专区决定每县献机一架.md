The Fuyang Prefecture Resist-America Aid-Korea branch held a meeting and decided to donate nine planes, two tanks, two artillery pieces, and one anti-aircraft gun.

The prefecture governs nine counties and has reached the goal of one plane per county. The people of Wuwei County, south of the Huai River, have also decided to donate two airplanes.
