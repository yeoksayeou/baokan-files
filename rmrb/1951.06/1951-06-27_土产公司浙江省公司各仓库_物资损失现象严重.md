　　Serious Material Losses in Warehouses of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Native Produce Company

    The Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Native Produce Company's warehouses, after inspection by the Provincial People's Government inspection team, were found to have quite serious material losses. Hams stored in the warehouses were piled up haphazardly, without being sorted by grade. Some were soaked by rain, the lower layers were damp and soft, and some were infested with insects. The bottom layer of the Northeast soybean cakes had turned red and solidified with the floor, and the upper layer was also growing green mold. Many of the stored tobacco leaves were damp and heating up. One hundred and ninety-eight pillow mats were moldy and rotten, and another three hundred and two were of reduced quality, only able to be sold at 85% of the original price. Most of the Xuan ginseng had insects. In the stored brown sugar, the parts exposed to the air were mostly damp and dissolved, solidifying into hard lumps or dissolving into sugar juice.
    The reasons for these material losses are, objectively, due to the poor warehouse conditions. Most are rented civilian houses, which are old, dilapidated, and leaky, and the equipment is not complete. However, subjectively, there are also the following reasons: First, the company has no plan for storing materials and did not store damp-prone and moisture-sensitive materials separately. According to warehouse managers, the pillow mats were already damp during transit. After they discovered this, they reported it to the company, but it was not dealt with in time, and they were still piled up in the warehouse, causing the losses to gradually increase. Second, the company lacks supervision, inspection, and specific assistance to the work of the various warehouses. Third, the custodians do not cherish state property and lack research into custody work on weekdays, treating the stored materials with a temporary perspective. Fourth, although the company's regulations stipulate weekly and monthly warehouse inspections, they are not thoroughly implemented. These problems should all be improved in the future.

### 土产公司浙江省公司各仓库  物资损失现象严重

　　土产公司浙江省公司各仓库
    物资损失现象严重
    中国土产公司浙江省公司所属各仓库，经省人民政府检查组检查，发现物资损失现象相当严重。各仓库储存的火腿，不分档次零乱堆放。有一部分被雨淋湿，下层受潮发软，有的已生虫。东北豆饼底层已发红色，与地板凝成一块，上层亦生绿毛。所存的烟叶中，很多都已受潮发热。枕席霉烂了一九八条，还有三○二条品质降低，只能打八五折出售。元参大部已有虫。所存的红糖中，凡与空气接触部分，大部受潮溶化，凝成硬块或溶为糖汁。
    这些物资损失的原因，客观上是由于仓库条件较差，大部分是租借民房，房子老旧，年久失修，漏水，各种设备也不完全。但在主观方面，也有这样几个原因：一、公司对储藏物资无计划，没有将受潮与易受潮的物资分仓分类放存。据仓库管理员谈：枕席在转运途中已受潮，他们发现后即向公司反映，但是没有及时处理，仍旧堆在仓中，使损失逐渐加重。二、公司对各仓库的工作缺少督促检查和具体帮助。三、保管员对国家资财不爱护，平日缺少对保管工作的研究。对寄存物资则抱着临时观点。四、仓库检查制度虽有公司规定周查和月查，可是贯彻得不够。这些问题，都应该在以后改进。
