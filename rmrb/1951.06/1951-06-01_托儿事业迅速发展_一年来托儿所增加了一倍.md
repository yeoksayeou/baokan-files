　　Childcare Services Rapidly Developing
    One Year Sees Crèches Double in Number

    The burgeoning childcare services across the country are rapidly developing over the past year.

    According to incomplete statistics, there are now 1,079 crèches in 27 major provinces and cities across the country, caring for 42,312 children. This represents a doubling compared to the 541 crèches that existed a year ago, and a ninefold increase compared to the number of crèches in major cities before liberation.

    Some of the crèches in various locations were originally institutions used by imperialist elements under the guise of "charity" to harm Chinese children. For example, the mortality rate of children cared for in Nanjing's "Sacred Heart Children's Home" and "Loving Infant Home," and Guangzhou's "Holy Infant Nursery" were all above 80%. Under the just demands of the broad masses of people, these institutions have been taken over or supervised for reorganization by the relief agencies of the Chinese people in various locations.

    Last year, relevant authorities across the country began training childcare workers, with a total of 3,593 childcare workers trained. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also trained a batch of childcare workers.

    Currently, the number of crèches still falls far short of objective needs, and there is an extreme shortage of childcare staff. Existing childcare services in various locations also have some significant shortcomings, such as the leaders of some childcare institutions neglecting the scientific methods of childcare work, and the childcare staff of some childcare institutions thinking that they have completed their task as long as they raise the children to be chubby, paying no attention to the children's education. These situations all need to be improved.

### 托儿事业迅速发展  一年来托儿所增加了一倍

　　托儿事业迅速发展
    一年来托儿所增加了一倍
    新兴的全国各地托儿事业，一年来正在迅速地发展着。
    据不完全统计，全国二十七个主要省、市中，现在已有托儿所一千零七十九处，受托儿童四万二千三百十二人；比较一年前的托儿所五百四十一处增加了一倍；比较各大城市解放前的托儿所数目则增加了九倍。
    各地的托儿所中，有一部分原是帝国主义分子假“慈善”为名而残害中国儿童的机构。如南京的“圣心儿童院”、“慈爱育婴院”，广州的“圣婴育婴院”等，受托儿童的死亡率都在百分之八十以上。在广大人民群众的正义要求下，这些机构已经由各地中国人民的救济机关分别接办或监督其改组。
    去年全国各地有关机关都开始了保育人员的训练，共计训练了保育员三千五百九十三人。内蒙自治区也训练了一批保育员。
    目前托儿所的数量还远落在客观需要之后，保育工作人员也异常缺乏，各地现有的托儿事业也还存在着一些显著的缺点，如有些托儿机构的领导人忽视保育工作的科学方法，有些托儿机构的保育人员以为只要把孩子养得胖胖的就算完成了任务，毫不注意儿童的教育。这些情况都需要改进。
