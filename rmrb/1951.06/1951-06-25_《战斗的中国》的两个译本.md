Two translations exist of Simonov's "Fighting China": 1. Translated by Qian Xinzhe, first published by Wenguang Bookstore in early January 1951; 2. Translated by Shi Xinghuo, first published by Pingming Publishing House in early April 1951. Qian's translation is based on the Russian text, while Shi's translation is based on the English translation.

Reader Mo Lin wrote to us saying that he compared these two books, both 32mo in size and typeset in No. 5 font. Shi's translation has 95 more pages than Qian's, leading him to suspect that Qian's translation may have been abridged. Comparing the translations, Shi's translation is also stronger than Qian's. For example: "The last paragraph on page 18 of Qian's translation: '--all of which are the sixty billion US dollars worth of equipment that the Americans put into the pockets of Chiang Kai-shek and his gang without any glorious achievements.' Not only is the sentence awkward to read, but the meaning is not fully and correctly translated. Shi's translation is: 'This is part of the sixty billion US dollars of investment that the Americans have poured into the "bottomless bag" of Chiang Kai-shek and his group in recent years without any return.' This is clearer. Furthermore, Qian's translation even transliterates the well-known jeep from the Russian sound as the American "Willis" brand car, which is too rash."

The letter points out that neither Qian's nor Shi's translation has earnestly investigated and sought accurate information regarding the many Chinese names and place names in the book. They only mark the transliterated characters, indicating whether they are correct or not, without taking responsibility. "This is not very good, because this is about our own affairs!" We agree with Mr. Mo's view of these two translations and hope that the translators of these two books will revise them before reprinting.

　　《战斗的中国》的两个译本
    西蒙诺夫著《战斗的中国》有两个译本：一、钱新哲译，文光书店一九五一年一月初版；二、施星火译，平明出版社一九五一年四月初版。钱译本是根据俄文本译的；施译本是根据英译本译的。
    读者莫林写信给我们说：他曾把这两本同是三十二开、同样用五号字排的书对照了一下，施译本比钱译本多九十五页，推测钱译本可能有删节。再把译文对照一下，施译本也比钱译本强些。例如：“钱译十八页末一段：‘——所有这些都是美国人毫无辉煌成绩地放到蒋介石及其一伙吞纳一切的口袋中的六十亿美元装备的。’非特句子读起来佶屈聱牙，意思也译得不全正确。施译是：‘这就是近几年来美国人倾入蒋介石和他的集团的“无底袋”里去的毫无代价的六十亿美元的投资中的一部分。’这便比较清楚。又如钱译本竟将众所皆知的吉普车照俄音译为美国的“威里斯”牌汽车，实在太轻率了。”
    来信指出：不论钱译本或施译本，对书中我国的许多人名与地名都没有认真地探究，求得翔实，都只标出音译字样，表示是否正确，不负责任。“这是不太好的，因为这是谈到我们自己的事情啊！”我们同意莫君对这两个译本的看法，希望这两本书的译者在再版前都应该有所修订。
