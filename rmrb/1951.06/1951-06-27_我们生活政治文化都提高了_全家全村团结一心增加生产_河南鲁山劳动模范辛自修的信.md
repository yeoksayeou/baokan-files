　　Our Life, Politics, and Culture Have All Improved. The Whole Family and Village Are United to Increase Production
   ——A Letter from Xin Zixiu, a Model Worker in Lushan, Henan

Respected Chairman Mao:

I am a peasant from Gushan Village, Shipotou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province. My entire family of twenty people misses you all the time. The Party's birthday – "July 1st" is approaching, and my whole family discussed with each other, saying: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved us, how should we repay them?" The mutual aid team I lead, consisting of thirteen households, also has the same thoughts.

Thinking back to the old society under the rule of the Kuomintang, my family's life was so difficult. We tilled the landlord's land; the men had to carry water and grind flour for them, and the women had to wash clothes and coax the children. If we didn't serve them well, we would be dispossessed of our land and evicted from our houses. When the autumn wheat was brought to the threshing ground, it was carried away by the landlords bag after bag! After working for a year, we were still left starving. What was even more hateful was that the puppet Baojia heads and landlords were hand in glove, demanding grain, levying funds, and conscripting soldiers. At the slightest provocation, our families would be beaten, scolded, and bound with ropes. In the famine year of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, my entire family went to Nanyang to beg for food, suffering from hunger and cold, and almost became "starved ghosts" in a foreign land.

Now, the life I live is truly like heaven compared to the past. During the land reform, I was allocated eleven houses and 28.84 mu of land. Cultivating our own land, we have so much energy! Last autumn, my family's income was 28 shi (14,000 jin) of coarse grains, 13,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and 100 jin of pure cotton. Besides eating and dressing well, my family still had a surplus of more than 3,000 jin of coarse grains by this wheat harvest season. Last winter, we planted 24 mu of wheat, applying a total of 120 carts of manure (1,000 jin per cart) before and after, and we hoed it three times this spring. When the weather was dry in April, we watered it all once. Therefore, the average yield of grain per mu during the wheat harvest was 200 jin, which is an increase compared to last year. We harvested a total of eight shi of wheat and four shi of barley and peas. It truly is "big circles fill, small circles overflow"! What makes me even happier is that our social status has improved. In the old society, who knew the name of Xin Zixiu? Now, I am the production committee member of the township government and the organization committee member of the township branch. At the first Lushan Hero Model Conference last year and the Anti-American Patriotic Model Representative Conference in May this year, I was twice elected as a first-class model. The whole county knows me, and my name has been published in the newspapers.

Respected Chairman Mao! With the improvement of our lives and the increase of our social status, my whole family is also undergoing a great transformation in culture. In the past, no one in the family had ever entered the door of a school, but now, in addition to the four children regularly attending school, the adults are also very actively learning culture. I have been working hard to learn since liberation and have now learned more than 1,000 characters. I can read newspapers, take notes, and write letters. My family now subscribes to one copy each of the Henan Daily and the Henan Dazhong Daily, and I take the time to read them to my family.

My family has raised its awareness through learning. In the past, the sisters-in-law liked to "accumulate private savings," and the brothers were constantly arguing about dividing the family. Now, after my persuasion and mobilization and the implementation of democracy, the sisters-in-law have taken out their private savings and unified the family's financial economy, removing the root cause of family disunity. The whole family has also established a bi-monthly family meeting system, where everyone discusses matters and clearly divides the work. In this way, the family has gone from disharmony to harmony and from disunity to unity.

My family is united, and our thinking is consistent. Not only is production doing well, but our patriotic enthusiasm is also much stronger than before. Whenever a central task arrives, my whole family responds enthusiastically. When the National Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association called for donations for airplanes and artillery, my whole family donated 250,000 yuan. (My patriotic pledge includes the clause "Donate money to support the Volunteer Army.") At the same time, we also specially checked our work of giving preferential treatment to military families.

Respected Chairman Mao! On behalf of my whole family, I express to you: "If the country needs us to provide manpower, we will provide manpower; if it needs us to provide money, we will provide money." My third younger brother, Changfu, and my nephew, Xin Nian, a family of two, are waiting to join the army, resolutely resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending our country.

Respected Chairman Mao! I deeply know that my own liberation and transformation is due to you and the Communist Party. At the same time, I am a Communist Party member myself and should play a exemplary and leading role in various tasks. Therefore, I have always actively responded to and taken the lead in implementing your and the Party's instructions. I feel that whatever you say is never wrong. Here, after the land reform was completed in the winter before last year, when we moved into the great production movement last spring, I responded to your call to "get organized" and mobilized my close (friendly) neighbors to establish the first mutual aid team in the township. For more than a year, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, absorbing the progressive experiences of labor models and mutual aid teams from various places, we have made this group go from not calculating work to calculating work, from agricultural collective work and sideline individual work to the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, from seasonal mutual aid to year-round mutual aid, and from being unconsolidated to being consolidated. Last year, our group generally achieved three plows, four harrows, five hoeings, and 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. We also took the time to open up 49 mu of barren mountains, increasing the production of fine grains by more than 1,900 jin. When the wheat was harvested, it was calculated that the 13 households in the group had an average surplus of more than 1,000 jin of grain after eating and using it.

This spring, our group has also formulated a patriotic production increase plan: requiring an average annual yield of fine grains per mu to reach 240 jin (an increase of 40 jin per mu compared to last year). At the same time, we have also established a meeting system every ten days to summarize the production achievements of the previous ten days and discuss the work of the next ten days. Making temporary plans in this way results in consistent action, great enthusiasm, and more work. During the wheat harvest, we planned to finish harvesting in five days in advance, but we finished threshing and cleaning the fields in just four days. With the improvement of agriculture and sideline occupations, my group's sideline occupations are also doing very well. Selling coal, cotton ginning, raising tussah silkworms, planting trees, raising chickens, and raising pigs all bring in a lot of income. Therefore, we have also bought some livestock and farm tools, which, in addition to the original ones, means that there will be no more difficulties in terms of farm tools and livestock in the future! We are all full of confidence and dare to guarantee that this year's production increase plan can be completed.

All 19 able-bodied laborers in our group are students of the people's school. From last winter to now, they have all learned to recognize from 50 to 400 characters (including dictation). Whenever we go to the fields, we bring newspapers and literacy wooden plaques, and we read newspapers and practice characters during breaks.

At the same time, in order to shoulder the responsibility of the production committee member, I help the whole township to organize mutual aid. During the meetings of my group, I absorb the heads of the mutual aid teams in the whole township to participate, solving the difficulty of having few leadership methods. This spring, under my help and the influence of my group, 49 mutual aid teams have been organized in the whole township. What makes me particularly happy is that their actions are consistent with my group. Whatever I do, they do the same. If they don't have a meeting for a few days, they will go to my group and ask, "What have you been doing these days?" They will then follow suit when they go back. Therefore, my whole township has made great production achievements this spring.

Respected Chairman Mao: If you had not commanded the People's Liberation Army to liberate Lushan, if it were not for your and the Party's correct and wise leadership and education, how could Xin Zixiu have changed from poor to rich, and how could I have been able to transform from a "laotu" (Lushan dialect: peasant) into a labor model? "Without the Communist Party, I would not be where I am today!" Chairman Mao! I sincerely support you and our Party, I sincerely obey your instructions and leadership, and will always follow you!

　　我们生活政治文化都提高了  全家全村团结一心增加生产
   ——河南鲁山劳动模范辛自修的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我是河南省鲁山县石坡头乡孤山村的一个农民。俺全家二十口人，都时刻怀念着你。党的生日——“七一”快到了，我全家互相商量着说：“共产党毛主席救了咱，咱咋样报答呢？”我领导的互助组共十三户，也都有同样的心事。
    回想起在旧社会国民党统治下的时候，俺家的日子是那样难过。种着地主的地，男人们得给人家担水磨面，女人们得给人家洗衣裳哄孩子。一点侍候不到，就叫丢地（夺佃）腾房子。秋麦收到场里啦，给地主一袋一袋扛走啦！劳动了一年，还落个饿肚子。更可恨的是伪保甲长和地主们一鼻孔出气，要粮派款抓壮丁，动不动一家人就会挨打受骂和被绳捆索绑。民国三十二年灾荒年成，俺全家到南阳一带去逃荒要饭，受尽饥寒，差一点当了外乡的“饿死鬼”。
    现在，我过的日子，比起过去，真是一个是天上，一个是地下。土地改革时，俺分到了十一间房子，二十八亩八分四厘地。在自己的土地上耕作，劲头可大了！去年秋季，全家收入杂粮二十八石（一万四千斤）、红薯一万三千斤、净棉一百斤。全家除吃饱穿暖外，到今年麦天还节余了杂粮三千多斤。去冬种了二十四亩麦，前后共上粪一百二十车（每车一千斤），今春都锄了三遍。四月天气旱时，又普遍浇了一遍。因此，麦收时每亩平均产粮二百斤，比去年是提高了。共收小麦八石，大麦豌豆四石。真是“大圈?堆小圈满”呀！我更感到高兴的是社会地位提高了。在旧社会时，我辛自修的名子谁知道呢？现在呢，俺是乡政府的生产委员，乡支部的组织委员。去年鲁山首届英雄模范大会和今年五月的反美爱国模范代表大会上，我两次被选为一等模范。全县都知道俺，报纸上也登出了俺的名子。
    敬爱的毛主席！随着生活的好转与社会地位的提高，俺全家在文化上也正在大翻身。过去一家人没有一个登过学屋门，现在全家除了四个孩子经常上学外，大人们也都很积极地学习文化。我由解放以来就努力学习，现已认识了一千多字，报纸能看了，笔记能记了，信也能写了。俺全家现订有河南日报、河南大众报各一份，我抽空就念给家中人听。
    俺一家从学习中提高了觉悟。过去妯娌们好“攒体己”（私人积蓄），弟兄们终天闹着分家。现在，经过我的说服动员和实行民主，妯娌们的体己钱都拿了出来，统一了家庭财政经济，拔掉了家庭不团结的根子。全家又建立了半月一次的家庭会议制度，有事大家商量，明确地分了工。这样一来，一家人由不和睦走上和睦，由不团结走上团结。
    俺一家人团结了，思想上一致了，不仅生产搞的好，而且在爱国热情上比以前也强得多了。每当中心工作到来时，我们全家都是热烈的响应。全国抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机大炮时，俺全家又捐款了二十五万元。（俺的爱国公约上就有“捐款支援志愿军”这一条。）同时，又特别检查了一下俺的优待军属工作。
    敬爱的毛主席！我代表俺全家向你表示：“国家需要我们出人，我们出人；需要出钱我们出钱。”俺三弟长福、侄儿辛年一家两人等着要去参军，坚决的抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    敬爱的毛主席！我深知道自己的翻身、解放是依靠了您和共产党。同时，我自己又是一个共产党员，应该在各种工作中起模范带头作用。所以，一向对您和党的指示，我都是很积极地响应和带头执行，我觉得凡是你说出来的话就没有错。我们这里在前年冬天土地改革完成以后，去年春天转入了大生产运动的时候，我便响应了你的“组织起来”的号召，动员了和我合厚的（友好之意）邻人，成立了全乡第一个互助组。一年多来，在党和人民政府领导下，吸收了各地劳动模范和互助组的进步经验，使我们这一组由不计工到计工，由农业伙干、副业单干走上农副业结合，由季节互助转为常年互助，由不巩固到巩固。去年俺这一组普遍都做到每亩地犁三、耙四、锄五、施肥五千斤。又抽空全组开山荒四十九亩，增产细粮一千九百多斤。全组十三户，收麦时计算，除吃除用，每户平均余粮一千斤以上。
    今春俺这一组又订出了爱国增产计划：要求平均每亩地年产细粮达到二百四十斤（每亩比去年增产四十斤），同时又建立了十天一次的会议制度，总结前十天生产成绩，讨论后十天的工作。这样作出临时计划，行动一致，劲头大，出活多。收麦时，事前计划五天收完，可是四天就场光地净了。随着农副业的搞好，我组的副业也搞得很好，卖煤、弹花、养柞蚕、种树、喂鸡、喂猪收入都不少，因此，又添买了些牲口农具，再加上原有的，今后农具牲口方面，再也不会发生困难啦！今年的增产计划，我们都满有信心的敢保证能完成。
    俺组的十九个全劳力，都是民校的学员，从去冬到现在都已认识了五十个到四百个字（管默写）。俺们每逢下地时，都带着报纸和识字木牌，在歇息的时候，就进行读报和练习字。
    同时，我为了把生产委员的责任担起来，帮助全乡都组织互助。在俺这一组会议时，吸收全乡的互助组长来参加，解决他们领导办法少的困难。今春全乡在我的帮助和俺组的影响下，组织起来四十九个互助组。特别觉得高兴的是他们的行动和俺组都一致，俺做啥，他们也做啥。几天不开会，他们就去俺组问：“你们这几天干哩啥呀？”回去后照着办。所以俺全乡今春的生产成绩很大。
    敬爱的毛主席：不是你指挥人民解放军解放了鲁山，不是您和党正确英明的领导和教育，我辛自修咋会由穷变富，我咋会能以“老土”（鲁山土话：庄稼人之意）变为劳动模范呢？“没有共产党我就不会有今天！”毛主席！我真诚地拥护你和咱的党，我真诚地服从你的指示和领导，永远跟着你走！
