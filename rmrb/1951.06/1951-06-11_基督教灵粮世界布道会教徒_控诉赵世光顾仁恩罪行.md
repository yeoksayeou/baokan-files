Christian Spiritual Food for the World Evangelization Crusade Congregants
Accuse Zhao Shiguang and Gu Renen of Crimes

More than 1,000 pastors and congregants from various churches of the Chinese Christian Spiritual Food for the World Evangelization Crusade in Shanghai held an accusation meeting on the 3rd to accuse Zhao Shiguang, the former president of the Crusade, and the notorious American special agent Gu Renen of conducting counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of preaching. Zhou Fuqing, the acting president of the Crusade, and Liu Shulan, a deacon of Spiritual Food Church, accused Zhao Shiguang of spreading anti-Soviet and anti-Communist rhetoric in Hong Kong and attempting to undermine the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement among Chinese Christians. They pointed out that Zhao Shiguang secretly left Shanghai for the United States in March 1949; after Shanghai's liberation in May of the same year, he suddenly returned to Shanghai on September 26th and secretly went to Zhoushan on October 2nd, eventually going to Hong Kong via Taiwan. In Hong Kong, he sponsored the "Spiritual Food Weekly," which specialized in producing reactionary and absurd propaganda. For example, the fifth issue of the publication published a preposterous article entitled "Arise, Go South," openly inciting domestic Christians to leave the motherland and flee to Southeast Asia, and praising the "benevolence" of American and British imperialist missionary societies to the Chinese people. Zhao Shiguang also fabricated rumors to slander the patriotic Three-Self Reform Movement of Chinese Christians. Zhou Fuqing said, "Can we still tolerate this Zhao Shiguang, who is engaged in reactionary activities under the guise of religion?" He formally announced that the Executive Committee of the Chinese Christian Spiritual Food for the World Evangelization Crusade had expelled Zhao Shiguang from membership and severed ties with the Hong Kong branch controlled by Zhao Shiguang.

Those who accused Gu Renen included Lu Chuanfang, a deacon of Spiritual Food Church, Pastor Jin Han, and congregant representatives Sun Daifang and Tan Guoxing. They pointed out that Spiritual Food Church was the place where Gu Renen "preached" and "cured diseases" in Shanghai, and many congregants were deceived and麻醉 (anaesthetized/numbed) by him. Lu Chuanfang said, "Gu Renen not only spread anti-Soviet and anti-Communist absurd rhetoric while preaching, but also used the name of curing diseases to distribute reactionary leaflets to patients. Some of the leaflets even wrote: 'Pray for China on the crater,' his hostility towards the Chinese people has reached such a point, we demand that the People's Government severely punish him!" Zhou Fuqing, the acting president of the Crusade, reviewed the mistake of inviting Gu Renen to the church to "preach" and "cure diseases" at the meeting, and pledged that in the future, they must strengthen their study, enhance their vigilance, and expose and eliminate all imperialist claws and running dogs within the church.

　　基督教灵粮世界布道会教徒        
    控诉赵世光顾仁恩罪行
    中国基督教灵粮世界布道会在上海的各教堂牧师和教徒一千多人于三日举行控诉大会，控诉该会前会长赵世光和著名的美国特务顾仁恩以传教为掩护进行反革命活动的罪行。该会代理会长周福庆及灵粮堂执事刘淑兰控诉赵世光在香港散布反苏反共言论，并企图破坏国内基督教徒的三自革新运动。他们指出：赵世光曾于一九四九年三月离开上海潜往美国；同年五月上海解放后，又于九月二十六日突然回上海，十月二日又潜往舟山，经台湾转赴香港。他在香港主办《灵粮周刊》，专门制造反动荒谬的宣传。例如该刊第五期曾发表了一篇题为《起来，往南走》的谬文，公开煽动国内教徒离开祖国，向南洋逃亡，并且歌颂美、英帝国主义差会给予中国人民的“恩惠”。赵世光并造谣诬蔑中国基督教徒爱国的三自革新运动。周福庆说：“对这个披了宗教外衣进行反动活动的赵世光，我们还能容忍吗？”他正式宣布中国基督教灵粮世界布道会执行委员会已开除赵世光的会籍，并且已与赵世光控制的香港分会断绝联系。
    控诉顾仁恩的，有灵粮堂执事陆传芳、牧师金罕、教徒代表孙戴芳、谈国兴等。他们指出：灵粮堂是顾仁恩在上海“传道”和“医病”的地方，有很多教徒受了他的欺骗和麻醉。陆传芳说：“顾仁恩不但在传道时散布反苏反共的荒谬言论，并且利用医病的名义，向病人散发反动传单。有的传单上竟写着：“要为在火山口上的中国祈祷”，他对中国人民的敌视竟到如此地步，我们要求人民政府严厉惩办他！”该会代理会长周福庆在会上检讨了延请顾仁恩来堂“讲道”“治病”的错误，并提出保证：今后一定要加强学习，提高警惕，检举并肃清教会内部的一切帝国主义的爪牙及走狗。
