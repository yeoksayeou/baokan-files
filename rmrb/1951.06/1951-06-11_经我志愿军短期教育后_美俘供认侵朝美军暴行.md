Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th -- After being captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Second Lieutenant Lawrence Mauss of A Battery, 52nd Field Artillery Battalion, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, confessed to the various atrocities he personally witnessed committed by the American aggressor troops in Korea, after receiving lenient treatment and short-term education from the Volunteer Army. According to him, in early October of last year in Haeju, he personally saw four soldiers from the 24th Division of the U.S. Army rape a young Korean woman who was four months pregnant. Lieutenant Beer, the company commander of B Company, 21st Regiment of the same division, not only did not stop them, but even engaged in the same despicable act himself. American soldiers also frequently ran into Korean shops to forcibly take fruits, beer, meat, and various foods. If the shopkeepers asked them for money, they would be beaten. Mauss said that when they retreated from northern Korea last year, their battalion commander read them an order from MacArthur's headquarters, ordering all troops to adopt a scorched earth policy during the retreat. Mauss personally saw rice paddies burning in the fields, and American soldiers setting fire to village after village, driving the people out and taking the opportunity to loot. He saw such things all the way from Anju to Seoul. Based on his own experiences, Mauss recognized that it was American imperialism that was invading Korea.

　　经我志愿军短期教育后
    美俘供认侵朝美军暴行
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】被中国人民志愿军俘获的美军第二十四师五十二野炮营Ａ连少尉劳伦斯·毛斯，在受到志愿军的宽大待遇和短期教育后，供认了他所亲眼见到的美国侵略军在朝鲜的种种暴行。据他说，去年十月初他在海州亲眼看到一个已有四个月身孕的朝鲜青年妇女被美军二十四师的四个士兵强奸。该师二十一团Ｂ连的连长庇尔中尉不但不加制止，自己竟也干起同样的丑事来。美国士兵们还经常跑进朝鲜人的商店里去强拿水果、啤酒、肉类及各种食物，店主如果向他们要钱，就会挨打。毛斯说，当他们去年从朝鲜北部撤退时，他们的营长曾向他们宣读从麦克阿瑟总部发下来的命令，命令上要所有军队在撤退时采取焦土政策。毛斯亲眼见到稻禾在田里燃烧，美国士兵放火焚烧一个又一个的村庄，把老百姓赶出村去，乘机洗劫一番。从安州到汉城，他一路都见到这样的事情。毛斯根据他自己的见闻，认识了侵略朝鲜的正是美帝国主义。
