　　Cotton Farmers in Xiwu Village, a Suburb of Beijing, Respond to Government Call to Sell and Store All Cotton to the State
　　[Our Newspaper] The vast number of cotton farmers in Xiwu Village, Nanyuan Liangmian Management District, a suburb of Beijing, have enthusiastically launched a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign.
　　After seeing the instructions and other documents issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchasing and storing work published in this newspaper on June 1, the cotton farmers of the village unanimously expressed their support. They first stated: "We must not allow factories to stop production." They said: "If factories cannot weave cloth, and prices rise, we farmers will not be able to buy cloth or clothes, which would be too bad for us farmers." Zhang Xiugui, the vice chairman of the village farmers' association, said: "In the past, most of the farmers in our Xiwu Village worked for landlords. When the Japanese were here, our village also grew a lot of cotton, but at that time the cotton belonged to the landlords. In the past two years, we have turned over, have houses, land, and livestock. Last year, our village planted 1,500 mu of cotton, and this year we planted even more, a total of 2,200 mu of cotton. If it weren't for the government's help, lending us seeds and fertilizers, how could we afford to plant so much cotton? We are only now starting to eat our fill and dress warmly, and we must not forget the benefits the government has given us."
　　On the evening of June 1, the village government, the CCP branch, and the Communist Youth League branch jointly convened a meeting of administrative group leaders, party members, League members, and production activists from various natural villages to discuss the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchasing and storing, as well as the instructions of the CCP Central Committee to party committees at all levels to ensure the completion of cotton purchasing and storing tasks, and this newspaper's editorial "Respond to the State's Call and Launch a Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign." The meeting immediately decided that administrative group leaders in each natural village should convene mass meetings to publicize to the masses, immediately respond to the government's call, and launch a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign. The meeting also called on party members and League members to take a leading role in this movement. As of the 2nd, CCP members Zheng Yulu, administrative group leader Wang Yirui, and other cotton farmers reported that they had cotton in storage, and they were willing to sell all the cotton in storage to the government or store it in cooperatives, cotton yarn and cloth companies, and other national economic institutions. Currently, this movement is being carried out enthusiastically.

　　京郊西五号村棉农响应政府号召
    愿向国家售、存所有棉花
    【本报讯】北京市郊区南苑良棉管理西五号村广大棉农，已热烈展开爱国售棉储棉运动。
    该村棉农在六月一日看到本报登载的中央人民政府政务院发布的关于购棉储棉工作的指示等文件后，即一致表示拥护。他们首先表示：“我们决不能让工厂停工。”他们说：如果工厂织不出布来，物价高涨，我们农民买不上布，穿不上衣服，这对我们农民是太不好了。”该村农会副主席张秀贵说：“我们西五号村农民过去大部分都是给地主扛活的。日本人在的时候，我们村种的棉花也不少，但是那时棉花是地主的。这二年来，我们翻了身，有了房子，有了地，也有了牲口，去年我们村种了一千五百亩棉花，今年种得更多，一共种了二千二百亩棉花，如果不是政府帮助，贷给我们种籽、肥料，我们怎能种得起这样多棉花呢？我们现在才开始吃得饱了，穿得暖了，我们绝不能忘记政府给我们的好处。”
    六月一日晚上，该村村政府、中共党支部、青年团支部即联合召开了各自然村行政组长、党员、团员和生产积极分子会议，讨论了中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示，以及中共中央给各级党委保证完成购棉储棉任务的指示，和本报“响应国家号召开展售棉储棉运动”的社论。会议上当即决定各自然村由行政组长召开群众会，向群众进行宣传，立即响应政府号召，展开爱国售棉储棉运动。会上并号召党员、团员要在这一运动中起带头作用。至二日止，该村中共党员郑玉禄、行政组长王义瑞以及其他棉农都报告有存棉，他们愿意将所有存棉卖给政府或存到合作社、花纱布公司等国家经济机构。目前这一运动正在热烈开展。
