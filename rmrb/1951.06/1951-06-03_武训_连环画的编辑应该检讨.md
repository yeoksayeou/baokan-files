The Editors of the "Wu Xun" Comic Book Should Conduct a Self-Criticism

Comrades Editors:

The comic book "Wu Xun," published by the Shanghai Dazhong Fine Arts Publishing House, was compiled and drawn by the Audiovisual Department of Jinling University (Yang Baonan, artist). The main error of this comic book, like several other Wu Xun biographies, is its praise of feudalism. Moreover, it depicts Wu Xun the Second—Wang Pixian, Wu Xun the Third—Duan Chengze, and Wu Xun the Fourth—Tao Xingzhi. At the same time, in the caption for the picture of what the author calls "Wu Xun the Fourth"—Mr. Tao Xingzhi—it says: "Mr. Tao Xingzhi... developed the spirit of Wu Xun on a large scale, solved the difficulties of Yucai (i.e., Yucai Middle School—Editor), and laid the foundation for China's New Democratic Education." (See picture 86 of the book). So, our New Democratic education grew up on the foundation of Wu Xun. If New Democratic education is based on the foundation of feudalism, then is New Democratic politics and culture also based on the foundation of feudalism! This is an intolerable distortion and insult. The chief editors of this book, Jiang Feng, Chen Shuliang, Yefu, and Chen Yanqiao, are all leading cadres in the East China art world. Why did they only lend their names to the book and not carefully review the content of the comic book when they were the chief editors? I think that today, not only should those who have written, directed, or painted in praise of Wu Xun conduct ideological self-criticism, but all our editors should also conduct self-criticism, strengthen their sense of responsibility to the people, and overcome the bad habit of only lending their names without taking responsibility. Especially some editors who have some prestige among the masses should seriously correct their style, because many young people trust you.

### “武训”连环画的编辑应该检讨

　　“武训”连环画的编辑应该检讨编辑同志：
    上海大众美术出版社的连环画“武训”，是由金陵大学影音部编绘（杨宝楠画）的；这本画册的主要错误也是和其它几本武训画传一样地去赞扬封建主义，而且画中还画了武训第二——王丕显、武训第三——段承泽、武训第四——陶行知，同时在作者所称“武训第四”——陶行知先生这幅画的说明下写着：“陶行知先生………有规模的发扬武训精神，解决了育才（即育才中学——编者）的困难，并奠定中国新民主主义教育的基础。”（见该书八十六图）原来我们新民主主义的教育是在武训的基础上成长起来的，如果新民主主义的教育是从封建主义的基础上奠定的，那么新民主主义的政治文化是否也是从封建主义的基础上奠定的呢！这真是一种不能令人容忍的歪曲和侮蔑。该书的主编江丰、陈叔亮、野夫、陈烟桥都是我们华东美术界的领导干部，他们在主编这本书的时候，为什么只挂了名字而不去好好审查连环画的内容呢？我想今天不但曾经写过、导演过、画过颂扬武训的人应当检讨思想，我们的一切编者也应进行检讨，加强对人民负责的思想，克服那些光挂名字不负责任的恶劣作风，尤其是一些在群众中有些声望的编者，更应严肃端正自己的作风，因为许多青年是信任你们的。
