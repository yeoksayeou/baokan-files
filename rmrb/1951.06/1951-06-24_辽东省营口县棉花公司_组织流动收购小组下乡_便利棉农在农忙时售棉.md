Liaoning Province, Yingkou County Cotton Company
    Organizes Mobile Purchase Teams to Go to the Countryside
    To Facilitate Cotton Farmers Selling Cotton During Busy Farming Season
    In order to facilitate cotton farmers in selling cotton during the busy farming season, the Yingkou County Cotton Company of Liaoning Province contacted local Party and government organs, organized mobile purchase teams to go deep into the countryside, and conducted publicity and organized purchases in light of the current rural situation. After deployment on May 26, as of June 6, the average daily purchase was more than 800 jin of seed cotton and more than 200 jin of ginned cotton. After June 7, the average daily purchase of seed cotton reached more than 10,000 jin.
    The working method of the mobile purchase teams in this area is: First, contact the local administrative departments and cooperate with the central work of drought resistance, seedling replenishment, and insect catching in rural areas for publicity. When arriving in cotton-producing villages, first convene a meeting of Party members, League members, and activists through the Party branch, calling on Party members and League members to play a guarantee role in the patriotic cotton selling and storage movement, and take the lead in selling stored cotton to the state. Then convene meetings of each neighborhood to conduct patriotic ideological education and explain the importance of selling and storing cotton. Make farmers understand that if the supply of raw materials is insufficient, factories will stop work, workers will be unemployed, which will affect the clothing of soldiers at the front and people in the rear, and even cause price fluctuations. When encountering farmers who weave and spin for themselves, they are given a "detailed accounting" to explain that their own weaving and spinning is of low quality and requires extra labor, so it is better to buy cheaper cloth.
    The mobile purchase team mainly goes to villages where no cooperatives have been established, purchasing and publicizing at the same time. This approach has achieved results and is currently continuing.

　　辽东省营口县棉花公司
    组织流动收购小组下乡
    便利棉农在农忙时售棉
    辽东省营口县棉花公司为了使棉农在农忙时售花便利，与当地党、政机关取得联系，组织流动收购小组深入农村，结合目前当地农村情况进行宣传，组织收购。五月二十六日布置以后，截至六月六日，平均每天收购籽棉八百余斤，皮棉二百余斤。六月七日以后，平均每天收购籽棉达一万余斤。
    该地流动收购小组的工作方法是：首先向当地行政部门联系，配合农村抗旱补苗及捉虫等中心工作进行宣传。到产棉村时，先通过党支部召开党员、团员及积极分子大会，号召党员、团员应在爱国售棉、储棉运动中起保证作用，带头卖存棉花给国家。然后召开各闾会议，进行爱国主义思想教育，说明售棉、储棉的重要意义。使农民了解：如果原料供应不足，工厂停工，工人停业，就会影响前方战士和后方人民的衣着，甚至引起物价波动。遇有农民自织自纺者，就给“算细账”，解释自己织布纺线质量低又搭工，不如买便宜。
    该流动收购小组主要是到没设立合作社的村庄，边收购边宣传。这样做已经取得了成绩，现正继续收购中。
