    Hoping Literary and Art Workers Will Write for Children

    Editor,
    Children are the future masters of the country. To create many educational works that are loved by them is an important task for literary and art workers at present.

    In the Soviet Union, children's literature and art work is an important part of the entire literature and art work. From Soviet propaganda posters, we can see many works related to children. They also have publishing houses and film studios dedicated to children. Today, it is certainly not yet possible for us to establish such large-scale institutions. However, it is urgently needed to create some good literary works for children. Among the existing children's works, most are translations, such as "Watch," "Andersen's Fairy Tales," etc. Although these works are very good and are welcomed by children, they are too few and far from meeting the needs of children. At the same time, these works may not all be suitable for the needs.

    I hope that literary and art workers can go deep into the children's communities and create many excellent works for them. And record, process, and widely introduce the folk rhymes, fairy tales, and folk stories among the various ethnic groups in our country.
                                    Tang Tao, Administrative Cadre School of Shanxi Province

### 希望文艺工作者为儿童写作

　　希望文艺工作者为儿童写作编辑同志：
    儿童是国家未来的主人。为儿童创作许多有教育意义，并为他们喜爱的作品，是文艺工作者目前一个重要的任务。
    苏联的儿童文艺工作，是整个文艺工作中一个重要的部分。我们从苏联的宣传画中，就能看到许多有关儿童的作品。他们还有专为儿童设立的出版局，电影制片厂等。今天，我们要建立这样大规模的机构，当然还不可能。但是，为儿童们创作一些好的文艺读物，却是迫切需要的。在现有的儿童作品中，大部分都是翻译的，如：“表”、“安徒生童话”等，这些作品虽然很好，也受到儿童们的欢迎，却太少了，远不能满足儿童的要求。同时，这些作品也不一定都能适合需要。
    我希望文艺工作者，能够深入儿童群众中，为他们创作出许许多多的优秀作品。并将我国各民族间的童谣、童话和民间故事，记录、加工、广泛地介绍出来。
                                    山西省行政干部学校  唐涛
