The People's Revolutionary Military Commission's various military cadre schools must conduct another widespread student recruitment across the country to meet the needs of national defense construction. The enrollment methods are hereby stipulated as follows:

(1) The various military cadre schools under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission may, according to the unified plan of the Central Government, recruit a certain number of students with a certain level of education, pure ideology, and good health in designated areas and schools (including universities, specialized colleges, vocational schools, middle schools, secondary technical schools, and junior normal schools) at the same time (the enrollment conditions and numbers of each military cadre school are detailed in the respective school's enrollment brochures). The enrollment targets are currently university freshmen and sophomores, high school students aged seventeen and above, junior high school students, and primary school graduates, with a focus on this year's junior high school graduates in the summer. In addition, a small number of socially young people with equivalent cultural levels and political reliability may also be selectively recruited. However, university juniors and seniors, as well as medical students, are not eligible for recruitment.

(2) The People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of all major administrative regions, and the People's Governments at all levels of provinces (administrative offices, cities), counties (cities), should, according to the specific plans of the Central Government and the higher-level People's Governments, establish "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" composed of representatives from local educational administrative leading organs, the New Democratic Youth League organizations, student unions, and other relevant parties, to uniformly lead all enrollment work related to various military cadre schools in their respective regions—including the examination and approval of students and reception work. In the "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" of major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and counties (cities) where reception stations are established, representatives from the local military region political departments and the military cadre schools enrolling in the area must be included.

(3) The local "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" should, according to specific plans, stipulate the enrollment quotas for each region or the schools within their respective regions; be responsible for designating the gathering locations for students; and approve the "Military Cadre School Student Recommendation Committees" of each school under their jurisdiction.

The "Recommendation Committees" established in each school should be jointly composed of the New Democratic Youth League organization, the student union, and the educational workers' union of each school, and be responsible for handling the registration procedures for the unit and preliminarily examining the political and physical conditions of the registered students. The list of students who have passed the preliminary review by the "Recommendation Committee" should be filed with the school administration and then submitted to the higher-level "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committee" for review and approval.

The enrollment methods for primary school graduates and socially young people shall be determined by the local "Enrollment Committee" according to the specific circumstances.

(4) Regarding enrollment expenses, from the grassroots enrollment units to the reception stations concentrated in each province and city, all expenses shall be borne by the local People's Governments and reimbursed by the state treasury; the expenses for students traveling from the reception stations to the various military cadre schools shall be borne by the respective military cadre schools. The enrollment committees of the major administrative regions and the five provinces and two cities in North China should be responsible for formulating the budget and expenditure standards for enrollment expenses in their respective regions and must notify all relevant parties of the expenditure standards before the official start of enrollment.

(5) The registration period is from July 1st to July 15th.

(6) All registering students must adhere to the principle of complete voluntariness. After registration, all must be subject to the review and approval of the "Recommendation Committee" of their unit and the higher-level "Enrollment Committee" before being admitted to the school.

(7) The People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of all major administrative regions and the People's Governments of each province (administrative office, city) should, in accordance with this decision, formulate specific plans based on local conditions.
