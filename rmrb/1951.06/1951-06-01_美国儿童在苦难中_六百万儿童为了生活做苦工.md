　　Six Million Children Toil for a Living
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch] The Soviet newspaper *Komsomolskaya Pravda* published an article by Vadakin, narrating the facts of American children's difficult lives and the poisoning of their minds.
　　Vadakin began by saying: In January of this year, in Los Angeles, a mother named Sylvia committed suicide because she could not pay the rent and was evicted by the landlord. Her four orphans were abandoned on the street, waiting to starve to death. The Sylvia incident is a typical event in American reality.
　　American children are suffering the most brutal exploitation in the hell of American warmongers, and are in desperate poverty, pain, and disaster.
　　According to official statistics, six million children in the United States have to work as child laborers to earn a piece of bread. In canning, tobacco, textile and other factories, hundreds of thousands of eight- and nine-year-old children work from morning to night. According to the very incomplete statistics of the National Child Labor Committee, 2.5 million child laborers are employed in American industry, transportation, and commerce. They do the same work as adults, but as a rule, they only get half the wages of adults. If they are Black people and other minorities, the pay is even lower.
　　In American agriculture, hundreds of thousands of children of agricultural workers work with adults in the fields all day long for the farm owners. According to the *Labor Information Bulletin*, the vast majority of these children are under the age of sixteen, 65 percent are under the age of fourteen, and many are even under the age of nine. They only receive meager wages, live in hunger and fatigue, and are constantly in danger of being fired.
　　Vadakin continued: American demagogues not only physically trample on children, but also mentally destroy them, instilling them with the poison of hatred of humanity from an early age. The increase in juvenile delinquency in the United States is the result of the insane robber-baron propaganda. According to incomplete statistics, the number of juvenile delinquents in the United States now reaches one million per year. *The Compass* newspaper on January 5th reported that a fifteen-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, shot and killed her own father. This is a typical example.
　　Schools have established courses for children on protection against atomic bombs. Due to exhausting atomic bomb drills and panic, many American children suffer from neurasthenia.

### 美国儿童在苦难中  六百万儿童为了生活做苦工

　　美国儿童在苦难中
    六百万儿童为了生活做苦工
    【新华社三十日讯】苏联《共青真理报》登出了瓦达金的一篇文章，叙述美国儿童生活困苦以及思想遭受毒化的事实。
    瓦达金首先说：今年一月间，在洛杉矶有一个母亲西尔维亚因为交不出房租，被房东驱逐而自杀，她的四个孤儿就被遗弃在街头等待饿死的命运。西尔维亚事件是美国现实中的典型事件。
    美国儿童在美国战争狂的地狱里受着最残酷的剥削，而处在绝望的贫困、痛苦和灾难中。
    根据官方的统计，美国有六百万儿童不得不为挣一片面包而去做童工。在罐头、烟草、纺织等工厂里，有好几十万八九岁的孩子从早到晚地在工作着。据全国童工委员会极不完全的统计，美国全国工业、运输业及商业雇用的童工有二百五十万人。他们与成年人做同等的工作，然而照例只能拿到成年人工资的一半。如果是黑人和其他少数民族，报酬就更少。
    在美国农业中，农业工人们的几十万子女随着大人们一起成天在地里为农场主做苦工。据《劳工情况通报》杂志说，这些儿童极大多数在十六岁以下，其中百分之六十五在十四岁以下，有许多甚至还不到九岁。他们只得到微薄的工资，生活在饥饿与疲劳中，而且随时有被解雇的危险。
    瓦达金继续说：美国的愚民主义者不仅在肉体上蹂躏儿童，而且也在精神上摧残他们，从幼年起就灌输他们仇恨人类的毒素。美国儿童犯罪事件的增多就是疯狂的强盗主义宣传的结果。据不完全的统计，现在美国每年犯罪儿童的数目达一百万人。今年一月五日的《指南针日报》，曾报道了得克萨斯州豪斯顿城一个十五岁的女孩子用枪打死了自己的父亲。这是一个典型的例子。
    学校里为儿童设立了防原子弹的课程。由于疲劳人的防原子弹训练和惊恐，美国儿童很多患着神经衰弱症。
