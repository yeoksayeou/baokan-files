　　Construction is impossible without engineering design!
　Northeast Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Blind Construction
　　Water Source Project Suffers Serious Failure
　　Editor's Note: In order to draw the attention of financial and economic work cadres across the country to engineering design, the Government Administration Council issued a decision in December 1950, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council also promulgated the "Interim Measures for Basic Construction Work Procedures" in March of this year, which has achieved great results. However, the phenomenon of blindly carrying out construction without paying attention to engineering design continues to occur. This newspaper published an editorial yesterday entitled "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design" and published information from the Northeast Third Paper Mill. Today, we are publishing information about the water source project of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and in the future, we will continue to publish examples of failures caused by not paying attention to engineering design. Central-level, major administrative region-level, and provincial and municipal-level financial and economic work departments, as well as industrial and mining enterprises, should discuss the above-mentioned editorial and the published information in this newspaper, and use it to check the construction situation of basic construction projects in each unit. The important ones should make written self-criticisms and submit them to local newspapers or this newspaper for publication, depending on the situation. This newspaper hopes that the vast number of readers will cooperate with us in this regard and launch criticisms against the serious phenomenon of blindly carrying out construction without engineering design.
　　The most important construction project of the Northeast Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1950—the water source project—suffered a serious failure, mainly because a thorough engineering design was not carried out first. As a result, the project, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 40 days, only completed 16 percent in 50 days. After more than four months of construction (from March to July 1950), it repeatedly failed and was reworked, costing the state more than 15 billion yuan. The "Water Source Project" of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is divided into four major projects: (1) the inlet and culvert project leading to the sedimentation tank (the culvert is 93 meters long); (2) four large and small sedimentation tanks, covering an area of approximately 4,900 square meters and approximately 10 meters deep; (3) the filter project, 14.5 meters in diameter and approximately 7 meters high; (4) the clear water ditch and pumping station (pump room) project. The "Water Source Project" is the largest project of the factory, accounting for about one-half of the factory's civil engineering construction. The factory did not carefully consider the construction site of such an important project, nor did it submit the engineering design to the higher-level authorities for approval or review by higher-level engineering officials before construction began. This resulted in four major errors. First, when selecting the project site, the soil conditions and seepage conditions were not carefully understood, and insurmountable difficulties were discovered during construction. The foundation of the clear water ditch and pumping station was an old tidal ditch from many years ago, and the foundation of the sedimentation tank was an old pit that British imperialists wanted to build a dock in during the warlord rule 30 years ago but did not build. The soil was loose and close to the river. When digging five or six meters deep, river water poured in from underground, and quicksand flowed in with the water. The mud and water were dug out and piled up again. Even with seven water pumps installed, the seeping river water could not be pumped out completely. When the tide was highest, the river water was eight or nine meters higher than the foundation. The river springs became larger and larger, collapsing several meters of the river bank. It took hundreds of workers two days and one night to rescue the situation before it was out of danger. The second biggest failure was the design error of the sedimentation tank. The thickness of the retaining wall around the sedimentation tank was not enough, and the slope of the revetment on top of the retaining wall was too steep. Because these two structures were dry-laid, river springs poured in from the bottom and walls of the tank after they were built, and most of the retaining walls and revetments collapsed. Although repairs were made, the project ultimately failed due to fundamental design errors. Third, the location of the entrance was not properly selected. It was located upstream of a small peninsula on the riverbank, which could be silted up. If the intake was selected downstream of the small peninsula on the riverbank, the silting rate might be reduced due to the opposing river flow and tides. The riverbed was also made of stone. According to the rotation of the water flow, it might be possible to find a point downstream that would not be silted up, which would be more reasonable. Fourth, the inlet was installed in the water. There was mud and sand on the riverbed, making construction very difficult. The enclosure project was not done well, and the enclosure project failed three times, so it could not be constructed and was abandoned halfway.
　　Although the water source project of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company finally escaped danger with the active rescue of the staff, the project was crude, the quality was poor, and the foundation was not good. From the perspective of the overall project, it is quite unstable. The ten-meter-high stone foundation of the sedimentation tank was not well laid, and most of it went wrong. The four-meter-high stone foundation below has protruded. The pool is too close to the river. If no pool protection equipment is installed, it is easy to be washed away by the river. However, repairing the river embankment and protecting the pool will require a large amount of money. This is a serious consequence of not conducting good investigation and research before construction and acting rashly.
　　The "Water Source Project" is the lifeblood of the steel plant. If the water source project is not done well, the factory cannot start work. The leading cadres of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company always adopted a sloppy attitude towards this important project. They only sent design personnel who lacked both theoretical knowledge and practical experience to take on the design work of this important project, and the leading cadres did not closely grasp the leadership and inspection. According to the wrong design, the project was contracted to the Anshan Jianguo Engineering Company, which is perfect for everything. If this is done, how can it not fail?
　　In July 1950, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government had inspected the water source project of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and put forward suggestions for improvement. The Northeast Daily also made criticisms at the same time. This lesson is still worth paying attention to.

　　没有工程设计就不可能施工！
  东北安东冶炼厂盲目施工       
     水源工程遭受严重失败
    编者按：为了引起全国财政经济工作干部对于工程设计的注意，政务院曾于一九五○年十二月发布决定，政务院财政经济委员会亦于本年三月颁发了“基本建设工作程序暂行办法”，已收到很大的效果。但不注意工程设计而盲目施工的现象仍然不断出现。本报特于昨日发表“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，并发表东北第三造纸厂的资料，今天又发表安东冶炼厂水源工程的资料，以后，还要陆续发表一些不注意工程设计、因而遭受失败的例子。中央级、大行政区级、省市级财政经济工作各部门，及工矿企业，应对本报上述社论以及所发表的资料加以讨论，并据此以检查各单位基本建设工程的施工情况，其中重要者应作出书面检讨，分别情况交当地报纸或本报发表。本报希望广大读者在这一方面和我们合作，对于没有工程设计即行盲目施工的严重现象，展开批评。
    东北安东冶炼厂一九五○年最重要的建设——水源工程，曾遭受严重失败，主要原因是没有先作周详的工程设计。以致原来预定四十天完工的工程，五十天才完成了百分之十六。开工四个多月（一九五○年三月到七月），屡次失败，屡次返工，耗费国家财产一百五十余亿元。安东冶炼厂“水源工程”共分四大工程：（一）进水口及通达沉淀池的暗渠工程（暗渠全长九十三公尺）；（二）沉淀池大小四个，占用面积约四千九百平方公尺，深约十公尺；（三）过滤器工程，直径十四点五公尺，高约七公尺；（四）净水沟及扬水所（水泵房）工程。“水源工程”是该厂最大的工程，约占全厂土木修建工程的二分之一。对于这样一个重要工程的施工地点，该厂都没有仔细考虑好，也没将工程设计送交上级机关批准或更高级的工程负责人员的审查，即行开工。以致造成四个重大错误。首先是选择工程地址时，没有详细了解土质情况和渗透的情况，施工时发现难于克服的困难。净水沟和扬水所的地基是远年的潮沟，沉淀池的地基是三十年前军阀统治时期英帝国主义想修船坞挖了未修的旧坑。土质虚松，又紧靠江边，挖下去五、六公尺深，江水从地下涌入，流沙随水流入，连泥带水，挖出去又堆下来，安上七台抽水机，渗进的江水还是抽不完。江潮最大时，江水高于地基八、九公尺，江泉越涌越大，将数公尺江岸冲塌，经动员数百名工人抢救两天一夜，始脱险境。第二个最大的失败，是沉淀池设计的错误，沉淀池四围挡土墙的厚度不够，挡土墙上面的护坡坡度太陡，而这两项建筑因系干砌，因此筑成之后，江泉从池底及四壁涌入，大部挡土墙、护坡均发生塌毁现象，虽经抢修，但因设计上基本有错误，工程终归失败。第三是进入口地址选择不得当，在江岸小半岛的上游，有淤塞的可能，若在江岸小半岛下游选择取水口，淤积率可能因江流和潮水相抵而见减少，江底又是石质，按水流旋转情况，可能在下游找到不致淤积之点，这是比较合理的。第四，进水口安设在水中，江底有泥沙，施工很困难，围沿工程做不好，围沿工程失败三次，终于无法施工，中途而废。
    安东冶炼厂水源工程最后虽然在职工的积极抢修下脱过了险境，但工程粗糙，质量不好，地基不好。从总的工程来看，是相当不稳固的，沉淀池的十公尺高砌石地基打的不好，大部出了毛病，靠下面四公尺高的砌石地基已突出来，池子离江水太近，如不作护池设备，很容易被江水冲坏，但修江堤护池工程，又需要一笔大的费用，这是施工前未很好调查研究、草率从事所招致的严重恶果。
    “水源工程”是冶炼厂的生命源泉，水源工程搞不好，工厂就不能开工，对这一重要工程，安东冶炼厂领导干部当时始终采取马虎态度，只派了既缺乏理论知识又缺乏实际经验的设计人员，来负担这一重要工程的设计工作，而领导干部又没有抓紧领导和检查。根据错误的设计，就把工程包给安东建国工程公司即万事大吉，这样作，那还有不失败的。
    一九五○年七月，东北人民政府工业部已对安东冶炼厂水源工程加以检查，并提出了改进意见。东北日报亦同时提出过批评。这个教训，现在仍值得注意。
