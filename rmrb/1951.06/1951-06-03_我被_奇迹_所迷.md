　　I was fascinated by "Miracles"
　　An E
　　In the year when Mr. Tao Xingzhi passed away, he instructed me to write an opera about "The Life of Wu Xun." He gave me a Wu Xun pictorial and an article he had written.
　　I read the pictorial and the article many times, and I was simply fascinated by its "miracle"! I completed Mr. Tao's task with such enthusiasm, and I deeply regretted not having finished copying the last act to give it to Mr. Tao. Later, I gave it to Yucai School, and the school asked students to set it to music. After a long time, the students failed to compose it. I was very angry, blaming the students for not fulfilling Principal Tao's legacy and not valuing Wu Xun's cause.
　　When I was writing "The Life of Wu Xun," I was so ignorantly fascinated by the "miracle" that I didn't even study its historical background, completely forgetting the momentous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution that was completely contrary to Wu Xun's behavior at the time! This was not negligence, but an undeniable ideological error!
　　When I read about Wu Xun's kowtowing and kneeling in the pictorial, I blushed, more than once. Later, I closed the book, disgusted with it, and didn't want to look at it again. I regarded Wu Xun as my class friend, felt sorry for him, blushed for him, and the only aversion I felt in the end was regret for his ugly behavior, feeling that he had lost face, lost face for people like me, rather than disgust for his person. I did not despise his personality, did not hate his "cause," did not oppose his ideas, and did not recognize that he was a supporter of the ruling class, so of course there was no question of criticizing him.
　　But at the time, I found a way out for my error. I thought: It was myself who was "petty-bourgeois," it was myself who was falsely noble, it was myself who was unwilling to lower my status, it was myself who could not withstand this kind of "tempering," therefore I felt: "I can't do it! Wu Xun is the one who can!"
　　When I started writing about Wu Xun's ugly behavior and his fatalism, I felt uncomfortable, but I thought it was my duty to write it, and to write it sincerely, intending to reflect as much as possible, as well as possible. I did it, I did it enthusiastically! I tried my best to apply powder to Wu Xun, treating the masses as his foundation, and I self-hypnotized myself, believing that it was impossible for Wu Xun not to approach the masses at that time. So I forgave him for his fatalism and non-resistance, and gave him great sympathy. Especially Wu Xun's kneeling before the "scholar-official" for three days and three nights moved me. I thought that Wu Xun could only run a school by finding such an "enlightened gentleman" and "intellectual." Since Wu Xun didn't choose the wrong person, the fault was only on the side of the "scholar-official." I hated that the "scholar-official" was not "enlightened" enough to recognize Wu Xun's "greatness," not "enlightened" enough to unite with the proletariat. And it was a pity that "enlightened" people like the "scholar-official" had not helped him earlier, since Wu Xun was begging for alms year-round to run "free schools." Here, I was so fascinated that I completely lost my class stance, lost my ability to criticize, and didn't even understand the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism!
　　As for Wu Xun's attitude towards running free schools, first, I thought it was unimaginable that a person like Wu Xun who had suffered deep oppression would ask students to unconditionally study "the way of the sages" and continue to serve the class that oppressed him in the future. It must be that the information was insufficient, and the reports in this area were not valued. It must be that the class stance of the "gentlemen" and "teachers" who wrote Wu Xun's biography, their reactionary ideas, had buried Wu Xun's "purpose" and "merits" in running free schools. (I continued this idea until the criticism of the Wu Xun biography film was launched.) I didn't believe that Wu Xun's free schools would not produce revolutionary students. In my imagination, Wu Xun's students naturally could not be like the students of Yucai, because Wu Xun's era was not Tao Xingzhi's era, and one could not demand Wu Xun and his free schools with the demands on Mr. Tao Xingzhi and Yucai. Second, I thought that Wu Xun was just a simple poor peasant, a beggar, and it was already worthy of learning that he could beg for alms to run free schools. It was impossible for him to understand many revolutionary principles. When I was writing the script, I made unfair laments for Wu Xun!
　　At that time, of course, I had already read the sentence "Learn from the peasants" in books, and I had used these sentences to gild myself, brag, and teach others. This not only shows that I looked down on the peasants of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, but also looked down on the peasants of the liberated areas at that time!
　　Look! How "kind" and "righteous" I was! For the loyal and powerful supporter of the ruling class, the thorough feudalist, I painstakingly applied so much powder to his ugly face! And made unfair laments for him! I was overwhelmed by the words "farmhand," "poor person," and "beggar" and lost my class consciousness! This is not a problem that can be solved by "blushing," but should be self-examined until sweating all over.
　　On this issue, my sentimentalism, personal sense of superiority, failure to recognize the masses, unstable class stance, low political level, and all kinds of shortcomings and errors of reading Marxist-Leninist books without being able to apply them are fully manifested. And I think, the more I unconsciously try to hide my shortcomings and errors, the more clearly they will be exposed. Undoubtedly, it has hindered my progress and reduced my due efforts to serve the people.
　　After the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," I suddenly realized that Wu Xun was in fact a shameful model of compromise and surrender! As an oppressed and tortured poor peasant, to surrender to landlords and rulers in such an ugly way, there was no predecessor before Wu Xun, and no successor after Wu Xun! He was useless and harmful to the people at that time, and he is still useless and harmful to the people now. He will still be useless and harmful to the people in the future. However, having said that, I was harmed by him once, but now I am awakened. Extremes meet; Wu Xun concentrated surrenderism so much that the criticism of him became the most powerful education against surrenderism. This may be the only benefit of Wu Xun and the praise of Wu Xun!

### 我被“奇迹”所迷

　　我被“奇迹”所迷
    安娥
    在陶行知先生逝世的那年，他嘱我写一个《武训传》的歌剧。并给了我一本武训画刊和他写的一篇文章。
    我把画刊和文章读了许多遍，我简直被它的“奇迹”所迷！我是那样热情地完成了陶先生给我的任务，并且深为没有来得及抄好最后一幕，把它交给陶先生为憾。后来我把它交给育才学校，学校找同学去配谱，很久，同学没把它谱出来，我很生气，怪同学们不完成陶校长的遗志，不重视武训的事业。
    当我写《武训传》的时候，我被“奇迹”迷得无知到根本没有去研究它的时代背景，根本忘了当时与武训行为完全相反的轰轰烈烈的太平天国革命！这不是疏忽，这是不可置辩的思想错误！
    当我读到画传中武训的磕头下跪种种丑行，我红了脸，不止一次的红过脸。后来我合起书来，厌恶它，不想再看它。我把武训当作自己的阶级朋友，替他难过，替他红脸，最后感到的一点厌恶，也只是惋惜他的丑行，觉得他丢了人，丢了像我这样人的人，而不是厌恶他的本身。我不卑视他的人格，不憎恨他的“事业”，不反对他的思想，不认识他是统治阶级的拥护者，当然也就无所谓批判了。
    可是我当时是给我的错误找到了出路的。我认为：是我自己“小资产”，是我自己假清高，是我自己不肯把身份降下去，是我自己不能经得住这种“磨炼”，因此觉得：“我不行！武训才是行的！”
    在我动笔写到武训那些丑行和他的宿命论种种时，我难受，可是我认为我的责任应当写，而且真心真意地，意图反映得尽可能地多，尽可能地好。我做了，我热情地做了！我给武训尽我的力量把群众当粉给他擦，而且自我催眠，认为武训当时不可能不接近群众。于是对于他的宿命论，不抵抗主义我都原谅了他，并且给予极大的同情。尤其武训对于“举人老爷”的长跪三昼夜使我感动。我认为武训只有找到这样的“开明绅士”“知识分子”才能办学校。武训既然没有找错人，罪过就只是“举人”的一面的了。我恨那个“举人”不够“开明”，开明不到认识武训的“伟大”，“开明”不到与无产阶级结合。而且武训既是为办“义学”常年行乞，“开明”如“举人”没有早就帮助他，真是遗憾。在这里我被迷得完全失掉阶级立场，失掉批判能力，连起码的马克思列宁主义也不懂！
    至于武训对办义学的态度，第一，我认为像武训这样一个受过深重压迫的人，而叫学生无条件地读《圣贤之道》，将来仍为压迫他的阶级服务，这是不可想象的事。一定是资料不够，没有重视这方面的报导所致。一定是写武训传的“绅士”“先生”们的阶级立场，他们的反动思想，湮没了武训办义学“宗旨”和“功绩”。（这个思想我一直继续到对武训传电影展开批评的时候。）我不相信武训的义学会不产生革命学生，在我的想象中，武训的学生自然不能像育才的学生，因为武训的时代不是陶行知的时代，不能以对陶行知先生、对育才的要求要求武训和他的义学。第二，我以为武训只是一个简单的贫苦农民，乞丐，能够行乞办义学已经很可学习了，他是不可能懂得许多革命道理的。这些在我写剧本的时候，都替武训作过不平的哀鸣！
    当时在书本上我当然已经读到了“向农民学习”的句子，而且还用这些句子给自己贴过金，吹过牛，教训过别人。这不仅说明了我看不起太平天国时代的农民，应该也说看不起当时解放区的农民！
    看！我多么“善良”，多么有“义气”的呀！我为统治阶级的忠实有力的拥护者，彻头彻尾的封建主义者，为了他的丑脸，费劲给他擦了多厚的粉！并且替他鸣不平！我被“雇农”、“穷人”、“乞丐”几个字冲昏了阶级意识！这不是“红脸”可以解决的问题，而是应当自我检讨得满身流汗。
    在这个问题上，充分表现了我的温情主义，个人优越感，不认识群众，阶级立场不稳，政治水平低，空读马克思列宁主义书籍而不能运用的种种缺点和错误。而且我想，我一向越是下意识地想隐瞒我的缺点和错误，它必定越暴露得清楚。无疑地，它阻止了我的进步，减低了我为人民服务的应有努力。
    经过《武训传》的讨论，我才恍然大悟，认识到武训事实上是一个可耻的妥协投降的标本！以一个被压迫被折磨的穷苦农民，而向地主，向统治者用如此丑恶的方法投降，在武训之前无古人，武训之后无来者！他当时对人民是无益而有害的，现在对人民还是无益而有害的。将来对人民还是无益而有害的。不过话说回来，我是被他害过了一次，但是现在我觉悟了。物极必反；武训把投降主义如此集中了起来，因此对他的批判也就成了最有力的反投降主义的教育。这或者是武训和对武训的歌颂的唯一的利益吧！
