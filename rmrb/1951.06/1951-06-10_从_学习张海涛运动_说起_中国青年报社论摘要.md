　　Starting from the "Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement"
    ——Abstract of a China Youth Daily Editorial
    The China Youth Daily published an editorial on June 5th entitled "Starting from the 'Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement.'" Zhang Haitao is a student and Young Pioneer at Wenmiao Elementary School in Shenyang. Last October, when a fire broke out in the school's classroom due to an electrical fault, he bravely rushed to rescue property, for which he was commended by the school authorities and other relevant parties. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Municipal Education Bureau convened a city-wide Young Pioneers' conference to reward and commend him as a "Model of Love for the School." The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also "vigorously launched the Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement to strengthen patriotic education among young children."
    The editorial believes: It is commendable that a fifteen-year-old Young Pioneer possesses a conscious and courageous spirit of protecting public property. Pointing out specific and concrete role models in children's education, including praising children's own outstanding behaviors and qualities, is also an educational method that can be adopted. The editorial points out: What is worth discussing is what kind of form should our commendation of children take?
    The editorial points out: Zhang Haitao is still an underage child, and his body and mind are still developing and growing. He is not yet a mature and formed individual. The good behaviors and qualities he has demonstrated are only a starting point, a budding sprout. This sprout still needs to continue to grow and develop. Our attitude should be to cherish and cultivate such sprouts well, and help them obtain various favorable conditions for development. Now, vigorously launching the "Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement" is in fact enshrining an underage child as a model and banner among children. Even the education authorities formally proposed to learn his "spirit of consistency between theory and action" (calling on everyone to learn the spirit of consistency between theory and action from an un-grown elementary school student is a mockery of learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought). Newspaper reporters interview him, recording his words as famous sayings to be spread... Such practices, for a Young Pioneer, are obviously overestimating and demanding too much.
    The editorial points out: Since the "Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement" began, Zhang Haitao has had to receive many visiting reporters, older friends, and younger friends; he often has to go to other schools to give "reports"; and he receives many letters every day "paying tribute" to him and "learning" from him. This not only deprives him of some of his study time and energy, but also creates a burden on his spirit! People no longer regard him as a fifteen-year-old boy, but as a "model figure" who is already mature in all aspects. Therefore, he cannot help but learn to speak and act like a "model figure"... becoming prematurely mature. Such a practice is not cherishing him and helping his development, but will precisely hinder his normal development.
    The editorial concludes: Zhang Haitao's courageous act of protecting public property should be commended, but the commendation must be realistic and appropriate. Especially for children, because they are immature and unformed, we should generally only commend them for a specific thing they have done, encourage and help their continued development, and should not unrealistically exaggerate children's achievements and levels. If the words and deeds of a child who is still far from mature in all aspects are exaggerated into remarkable "exemplary words and deeds" and "profound truths," and all children are called upon to learn from him, and a widespread movement is created, this practice obviously lacks a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and may even produce some formalistic and undesirable consequences, so it is not a good example to follow.

　　从“学习张海涛运动”说起
    ——中国青年报社论摘要
    中国青年报六月五日以《从“学习张海涛运动”说起》为题发表社论。张海涛是沈阳市文庙小学学生，少年儿童队员。在去年十月，学校的教室因走电起火，他奋不顾身地去抢救，因此获得学校当局和各有关方面的表扬。沈阳市团委、市教育局曾为此召集全市少年儿童大会，奖励他，表扬他，称为“爱校模范”。团市委并“为加强少年儿童中的爱国主义教育，大力开展了学习张海涛运动”。
    社论认为：一个十五岁的少年儿童队员，能够有一种自觉的、勇敢的爱护公共财物的精神，是值得表扬的。在儿童教育中指出具体的、形象的学习对象，包括表扬儿童自己的优秀的行为和品质，也是可以采取的教育方法之一。社论指出：值得讨论的是我们对于儿童的表扬，究竟应该采取怎样的一种形式？
    社论指出：张海涛还只是一个没有成年的儿童，身心各方面都还正在发育成长，他今天还不是成熟的、定型的人物。他表现出一些好的行为，好的品质，也还只是一个起点，一个萌芽。这种萌芽还须经过继续的生长发展。我们应有的态度，是要对于这样的萌芽，加以很好的爱护、培植，帮助它获得各种有利的发展条件。现在大力开展“学习张海涛运动”，事实上是把一个未成年的儿童，奉为儿童中的典范和旗帜。甚至教育当局正式提出要学习他“理论与行动一致的精神”（号召大家向未成长的小学生，学习理论和行动一致的精神，这是对于学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的嘲讽）。报纸的记者去访问他，记录他的话当作名言传扬……。这样做法，对于一个少年儿童队员说，显然是估计太高，要求太高了。
    社论指出：自从“学习张海涛运动”以来，张海涛要接见许多来访问他的记者、大朋友、小朋友；常常要到别的学校去做“报告”；每天要收到很多向他“致敬”、向他“学习”的信。这不但是剥夺了他一部分学习的时间和精力，而且在他的精神上造成了一种负担！人家不再把他当作一个十五岁的少年，而是当作一个各方面都已成熟了的“模范人物”看待，因此他不能不学着像一个“模范人物”一样的说话、做事……变得少年老成。这样做法不是爱护他和帮助他的发展，而恰恰会是妨碍了他的正常发展。
    社论最后指出：张海涛爱护公共财物的勇敢行为是应该受到表扬的，但表扬必须实事求是，恰如其分。特别是儿童，由于他们不成熟、不定型，一般只应该表扬他所做的某一件事，鼓励和帮助他们的继续发展，不宜不切实际地过分夸大儿童的成就和水平。如果把一个各方面都还远不成熟的儿童的一言一行，都渲染成为了不起的“嘉言懿行”“至理名言”，要号召所有儿童来向他学习，并要造成广泛的运动，这种做法，显然缺乏实事求是的精神，甚至将会产生一些形式主义的不良后果，所以是不足取法的。
