Boost Production to Help the Volunteer Army Fight
Yan'an Sixth District, Shijia Yadi Village Checks on the Response to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's Challenge

To the Editor:

    Shijia Yadi Village, Fifth Township, Sixth District, Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, recently checked the implementation of its plan to respond to the challenge from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. The results of this inspection are as follows:

    Since responding to Li Shunda's challenge this spring, the entire village has plowed 130 mu of land, planted 75 mu of peas, 156 mu of hemp seeds, and 84 mu of black beans. A total of 250 mu of land has been cleared of grain stubble. All of the more than 340 mu of mountain land planted with crops have had water cellars built. The village originally planned to expand the cultivated area by 180 mu, but has now expanded it by 50 mu; judging from the current situation, this plan may not be completed. The entire village has organized four labor exchange teams and one handicraft team, with the number of participants accounting for 42 percent of the village's labor force; the original plan was to mobilize and organize 60 percent of the village's labor force, which has not yet been achieved. Those who participate in the labor exchange organizations are all households without livestock, who go out to work before dawn every day and only return after dark. Upon inspection, they do more work than households with cattle and individual households. The entire village has planted 240 trees, completing the plan. The entire village has bought back 100 piglets, with an average of two pigs raised per household. The entire village has given birth to three calves, and another ten cows are about to give birth. The entire village has given birth to 23 lambs and hatched ten nests of chicks. The increase in livestock and domestic animals can fulfill the plan.

    Since responding to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's challenge, the general mood for production in the village has risen. Party member Li Zhonghe gets up early to work every day and urges others to work. Lu Xinmin, a teacher at the village school, reads to everyone from the newspaper about the United States arming Japan and attempting to expand its war of aggression, as well as the history of American imperialism's aggression against our country. All the villagers know that doing a good job in production is helping the Volunteer Army fight. The township people's government conducts inspections of our village's production at any time. When inspector Xie Yong'an inspects production, he also helps our village promote the benefits of organizing labor exchange teams. This inspection is very helpful for our village's production.

    There are also shortcomings in production. For example, there is still unfair accounting in individual labor exchange groups, which has caused dissatisfaction among the members. Women's participation in production is not active enough. There are only two women in the entire village working in the fields. Of the 72 women in the village who can spin, only four or five are currently spinning thread. These shortcomings are being addressed.

　　搞好生产，帮助志愿军作战
    延安六区史家崖底村检查向李顺达互助组应战情况编辑同志：
    陕西省延安县第六区五乡史家崖底村，最近曾经检查了向李顺达互助组应战计划的执行情况。这次检查的结果是这样的：
    自今春向李顺达应战以来，全村已翻过土地一百三十亩，种下豌豆七十五亩，种下麻子一百五十六亩，种下黑豆八十四亩。掏了谷槎的地共二百五十亩。种上了庄稼的三百四十多亩山地，全都打好了水窖。全村原计划扩大耕地面积一百八十亩，现在已扩大了五十亩；照现在情形看，这一项计划恐怕不能完成了。全村已组织起四个变工队，一个扎工队，参加人数占全村劳动力百分之四十二；原计划要把全村劳动力的百分之六十，动员组织起来，现在还没有做到。参加变工组织的，都是没有牲口的人家，每天天不明就出去工作，天黑了才回来，检查起来，比有牛户和单干户干的活都多。全村共栽树二百四十棵，完成了计划。全村买回小猪一百口，平均每户养猪两口。全村已生下三个牛犊，另有十头母牛将要生牛犊。全村生了二十三个羊羔，并孵上了十窝鸡娃，牲口及家畜的增产，可以完成计划。
    本村自从向李顺达互助组应战以后，生产情绪一般都高涨起来。党员李忠和，每日一早就起来工作，并督促别人工作。村校教员鲁新民，把报纸上美国武装日本，妄想扩大侵略战争，以及美帝国主义侵略我国的历史等念给大家听，全村农民都知道搞好生产，就是帮助志愿军作战。乡人民政府对我村的生产随时进行了检查，指导员谢永安检查生产时，并帮助我村宣传组织变工队的好处，这种检查对于我村生产很有帮助。
    生产中的缺点也是有的，例如个别变工组内还有算账不公平的现象，曾引起了组员的不满。妇女参加生产还不踊跃，全村只有两个妇女下地。全村七十二个会纺织的妇女，现在只有四、五个纺线的。这些缺点，正在设法纠正。
