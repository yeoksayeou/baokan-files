Widespread Native Products Conferences Held Throughout East China Region
　　Discovering Clues to Connecting Internal and External Needs

　　Since February of this year, East China has universally convened native product conferences and held native product exhibition and exchange meetings, which has been an important start for the internal sales of native products in the region, and has made full preparations for the peak season of urban-rural exchanges after autumn. By the end of May, native product conferences above the special commissioner level had been completed, and various counties had also held one or two native product conferences or native product symposiums. A total of seven native product exhibition and exchange meetings have been held at the provincial and municipal levels.
　　The holding of native product conferences or native product exhibitions in East China has enabled governments at all levels and their trade departments to have a general understanding of the production and sales of native products in their regions, and to establish confidence in promoting native products. Through these conferences or exhibitions, clues were also discovered to connect internal and external needs within the East China region. For example, the flax that was unsalable in Suiyuan was the raw material needed by the paper industry in Zhejiang. At the same time, private merchants in various places also initially understood the government's policy of encouraging private merchants to promote native products. Representatives of private merchants in Shandong Province proposed at the meeting to "go far and wide to expand domestic sales," taking the promotion of native products as a practical action of patriotism. After the end of native product conferences or exhibitions in various places, private merchants successively organized joint operations to engage in trial sales of various native products. In Shanghai, forty industries have formed ninety-nine joint operating institutions, with more than 126 billion yuan used to operate native products, of which more than 78 billion yuan has been used to purchase native products in the countryside. In Jieshou City, northern Anhui, a quarter of the industries of private merchants have organized joint operating institutions to operate native products.
　　The East China Native Product Exhibition and Exchange Conferences have initially carried out the exchange of native products. The total transaction volume of the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition and Exchange Conference for fifty days reached more than 160 billion yuan, and the transaction value of the Southern Jiangsu Native Product Exhibition reached more than 10.3 billion yuan in a single day on May 26. Shengze flower silk in Southern Jiangsu, which was mainly sold abroad in the past, has begun to be sold to Xinjiang and other places after holding a native product exhibition. After the yellow grass woven products (grass slippers, grass handbags, etc.) for export were exhibited at the Zhejiang Exhibition, they changed from unsalable to popular, not only clearing out the inventory since 1948, but also having a large number of customers who placed advance orders.
　　Now East China has selected 500 representatives (excluding Shanghai) to attend the East China Native Product Conference to further discuss the issue of promoting unsalable native products.

　　华东区各地
　　普遍召开土产会议
　  发现沟通内外有无的线索
    华东各地自今年二月以来，普遍召开了土产会议和举办了土产展览交流大会，为全区土产内销作了重要的开端，为秋后城乡交流旺季作了充分准备。至五月底止，专署以上的土产会议都已开完，各县也都已开过一、二次土产会议或土产座谈会，以省、市为单位的土产展览交流大会共举办了七个。
    华东各地土产会议或土产展览会的举行，使各级人民政府及其贸易部门对本区的土产产销情况做到了大体心中有数，建立了推销土产的信心。通过这些会议或展览会，也发现了华东区内外沟通有无的线索，例如绥远滞销的线麻，就是浙江造纸工业需要的原料。同时，各地私商也初步了解了政府鼓励私商推销土产的政策。山东省私商代表在会上提出要“远走高飞，扩大内销”，把推销土产作为爱国主义的实际行动。各地土产会议或展览会结束后，私商纷纷组织联营，从事各种土产的试销。上海有四十个行业组成九十九个联营机构，用于经营土产的资金有一千二百六十多亿元，其中下乡收购土产的已有七百八十多亿元。皖北界首市私商有四分之一的行业组织了经营土产的联营机构。
    华东各地土产展览交流大会，都初步进行了土产交流。浙江省展览交流大会五十天的交易总额达一千六百多亿元，苏南土产展览会五月二十六日一天内交易总值达一百零三亿多元。过去主要销行国外的苏南盛泽花绸，在举行土产展览会后，已开始销往新疆等地。外销的黄草织品（草拖鞋、草提包等）在浙江展览会上展出后，从滞销一变而为畅销，不仅一九四八年以来的存货已经出清，并已有了大批预先订货的主顾。
    现在华东各地已选派代表五百名（上海除外）出席华东土产会议，进一步讨论推销滞销土产的问题。
