　　Shanghai Mechanical Workers Actively Support Farmers Along the Huai River
　　Huang Yuejun
　　The manufacturing of Huai River sluice gate components and the engineering design work, after two months of selfless effort by over 10,000 metalworkers in more than 100 steel and machinery factories in Shanghai, and the staff of the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, was completed as scheduled by the end of May. These components are now being installed at the Huai River construction site. This project is very large in scale, requiring 168 sets of hydraulic presses (for controlling the opening and closing of the sluice gates; 155 sets are actually needed, with the rest for spares), each weighing about four tons. Moreover, the precision of the oil valve processing must be quite high. Chinese steel and machinery factories have never manufactured such large and complex components. Initially, experts estimated that, based on the production conditions and capacity of Shanghai's factories, it would take five months to complete. However, the labor and wisdom of the working class finally overcame the numerous difficulties and completed it in two months. What is the reason for this?

　　Conducting Ideological Mobilization to Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance

　　When carrying out this arduous task, the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union, and the trade unions of the contracting factories first conducted full ideological mobilization. The Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union jointly convened a mobilization meeting of the chairmen and production committee members of the trade unions of the contracting factories.程望, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department, reported on the historical situation of the Huai River disaster and the significant political meaning of this project, explaining the blood ties between the working class and the peasantry, which greatly stimulated the political enthusiasm of the attendees. Ma Xiaodi, Chairman of the Metalworkers' Union, called on all employees to overcome any difficulties and strive to complete this political task ahead of schedule, which was warmly echoed by the entire audience. The factories immediately made guarantees, and actively issued and accepted challenges. Subsequently, each factory also held mobilization meetings to convey the report of Deputy Director Cheng Wang and the call of Comrade Ma Xiaodi; some contracting factories also organized workers who had personally suffered from the Huai River disaster to make reports at the mobilization meetings. Comrade Wang Xuedao from the No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Machinery Company reported: "In Mengjia Lake alone, the Huai River has not receded for ten years. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, all the disaster relief grain and project funds ended up in the pockets of the reactionary bureaucrats. The people drowned, starved to death, and died as refugees. Today, the People's Government has invested heavily for the sake of the millions of people on both sides of the Huai River and mobilized millions of workers to harness the Huai River. Our working class must use the attitude of masters to help the government complete this great plan and help the more than ten million peasant brothers and sisters in the Huai River flood area get rid of their suffering." The workers clearly understood the political significance of the Huai River harnessing project, which greatly strengthened their confidence in overcoming any difficulties and completing the task. The production committee member of the Asia Steel Plant said to the chairman of the Metalworkers' Union: "The workers in our factory hope to take on more tasks." The production committee member of the No. 3 Factory of the Shanghai Steel Company said to the production minister of the Metalworkers' Union: "No problem, we guarantee to complete the task on schedule!" The employees of each contracting factory plunged into a surging wave of labor with selfless spirit.

　　The model workshop of the No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Machinery Company originally planned to complete the task in six days, but completed it in two and a half days. Comrade Gong Zhiyuan, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Wusong Machinery Factory, stayed at the site all the time to help the workers solve production difficulties. His four-year-old daughter died in the hospital, but he did not go home once. When his wife cried and looked for him, he said to her: "This task of mine is much more important than a little girl!" Many workers, because of working day and night to rush the job, had little rest time and their eyes were bloodshot. When the cadres of the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union went to the factories to express their regards, the workers said: "Such an important task concerns the lives and property of tens of millions of people, what does our hard work matter!" They also hoped that the cadres of the Metalworkers' Union would have a general understanding of the work situation in each factory, and if any factory could not complete the task in time, they would be willing to go and help after they had completed their own tasks. Xie Shengyuan, the leader of the production team of the No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Machinery Company, said: "We workers must unite with the peasants to fight against the Huai River, just like the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting against American imperialism on the Korean battlefield, this is a glorious task!" With such a high degree of consciousness, and with such burning labor enthusiasm, what difficulties could not be overcome?

　　Workers and Experts Display Unlimited Wisdom

　　Administrative leaders fully mobilized the masses and resolutely relied on them, which not only universally stimulated the workers' labor enthusiasm and fully exerted their creativity and wisdom, but also combined the wisdom of the masses with the wisdom of technical experts. In this way, a great miracle was created. As far as the design of the Huai River sluice gate project is concerned, this was an unprecedentedly large and precise task, but the Technical Office of the East China Industrial Department basically completed the work in three weeks. Qi Rongpu, the design team leader of the Technical Office, said: "This is the result of the collective design of the design team, the technical personnel of the contracting factories, and the workers." He gave an example: "When designing the oil cylinder, the original plan was to use seamless steel pipes. Later, it was discovered that the stock was not enough, so we invited the technical personnel of the Shanghai Steel Plant, Asia Steel, Daxin, China Textile Machinery Company and other steel mills to discuss whether cast steel could be used instead. At the same time, considering whether the machinery factories would have difficulties in processing if cast steel was used instead, we invited the technical personnel of the Qiujiang, Wusong and other machinery factories to discuss together. After everyone's discussion, it was agreed that cast steel could be used instead, and the composition of the steel was determined. The technical personnel of each machinery factory unanimously believed that there was no problem in processing. The design team then decided to use cast steel instead of seamless steel pipes. Collective design is still a new engineering design method for us. In the past, when designers designed a project, they often did not consider the difficulty of materials and the equipment and technical conditions of various factories, and designed solely based on their own intentions, so that difficulties often occurred when the designed drawings were taken to the factory for manufacturing. Such problems will not occur with the collective design method. With this experience, we believe that in the future, any novel and arduous engineering design can be completed smoothly by adopting the collective design method."

　　In the process of manufacturing components, the masses of employees in each contracting factory also displayed a high degree of creativity and solved countless serious difficulties in materials and technology. Comrade Gong Zhiyuan, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Wusong Machinery Factory, said: "In this work, whenever we encountered any difficulties, the trade union would call everyone to a meeting, explain the difficulties, and ask everyone to jointly study and think of solutions; as a result, the difficulties were all solved." At first, the factory workers, when turning the blanks and welding, the inner and outer surfaces were blanks, using white steel knives and slow gears, it took eleven hours and thirty minutes to go through one cut, and the knives were also worn out. After everyone's research, they changed to using diamond steel knives and fast gears, and as a result, it only took one hour and forty minutes to go through. The hydraulic press equipment is complex and huge, and it has not been manufactured in China. The amount of molten steel required for the cast fittings of the piston cylinder cover and base exceeded the production capacity of Shanghai's steel plants. However, thanks to the high degree of creativity of the workers and technicians, the upper cover and base plate were changed to cast iron, which solved the difficulty of insufficient molten steel. The silicon brick arch in the steelmaking furnace of the No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Machinery Company collapsed, and it looked like it would affect the delivery date. The workers were unwilling to let it stop production and decided to adopt a hot repair method. Although the conditions were not adequate, such as the lack of heat protection equipment, they covered the fire with scrap steel and used iron plates to block part of the furnace wall, and then jumped into the furnace cavity one by one to carry out the repair work. After more than two hours of hard work, the repair work was finally completed successfully, making it possible for the casting task to be completed on May 5. Qi Yuanlong, a labor model from the Shanghai Cold Casting Factory, united with the technical staff and jointly solved the problems of shrinkage and sand inclusion in cast iron. When the technical office sent down the drawings of a part on the high-pressure oil pump of the Huai River sluice gate to the Xu Zhanghua team of the Wusong Machinery Factory, they carefully studied it and found that there were errors in the screws on the drawings, and corrected them in time, avoiding great losses. For example, Zhu Xuechang of the cleaning department and Li Dianjun of the electric cutting team of the Daxin Machinery Factory collectively created a method of directly cutting the oil pressure cylinder with high air pressure at one time, which increased the work efficiency by more than three times.

　　Improved Ideological Understanding Through Practice

　　The completion of the Huai River sluice gate project as scheduled will save 13 million peasants and 40 million mu of fertile land from disaster. In this great production practice, the Shanghai metalworkers received a vivid education on the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. Moreover, through this miraculous creation, cadres and the masses in all aspects were educated, and the views of some factory administrative leaders on the workers and the trade unions were changed. For example, the administrative side of the Asia Steel Plant did not believe that the trade union could play a big role in production in the past, and the relationship with the trade union was not very good; now they have begun to pay attention to the trade union, and the relationship with the trade union has begun to improve. The administrative leaders of the Wusong Machinery Factory used to rely solely on administrative orders in their work, but now they understand the importance of relying on the trade union to mobilize the workers. With this experience, the question of how the trade union should face production has also been basically resolved. After the completion of this project, the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union Committee immediately continued to implement the workers' production enthusiasm into the Ma Hengchang team competition movement.

　　上海机械工人积极支援淮河沿岸农民
　　黄岳军
    淮河水闸机件的制造和工程的设计工作，经过上海一百多家钢铁厂、机器厂万余五金工人和华东军政委员会工业部技术室工作人员两个月忘我的努力，已在五月底如期完成了。现在，这些机件正在淮河工地安装。这个工程规模非常大，需要一百六十八套油压机（供控制水闸的启闭之用；实际需要一百五十五套，其余备用），每套重量四吨左右。而且油门加工的精密度要相当高。中国的钢铁厂和机器厂还没有制造过这样大而复杂的机件。当初专家们估计：依靠上海各厂的生产条件和生产能力，需要五个月才能完成。可是工人阶级的劳动和智慧，终于突破了重重难关，在两个月的时间内把它完成了。这原因到底在哪里呢？
            进行巩固工农联盟的思想动员
    在执行这个艰巨任务时，华东军政委员会工业部、上海五金工会和各承造厂工会，首先进行了充分的思想动员。华东军政委员会工业部和上海五金工会联合召开了各承造厂工会主席和工会生产委员的动员大会，由工业部程望副部长报告淮河灾害的历史情况和这次工程的重大政治意义，说明了工人阶级与农民阶级的血肉关系，大大激发了与会者的政治热情。五金工会主席马小弟同志号召全体职工克服任何困难，争取提前完成这一政治任务，获得全场热烈响应。各厂立时提出保证，纷纷挑战、应战。接着各厂又分别召开了动员大会，传达了程望副部长的报告和马小弟同志的号召；有些承造厂还组织了曾经亲受淮河灾害的工友在动员会上作报告。中国纺织机器公司一厂汪学道工友报告说：“光是孟家湖这个地方，淮水就有十年未退。在国民党反动派的统治下，什么赈粮工款，全落到反动官僚的腰包里去了。老百姓淹死、饿死、流浪而死。今天人民政府为淮河两岸一千几百万人民花了大本钱，动员了百万民工修治淮河。我们工人阶级一定要用主人翁的态度来帮助政府完成这个大计划，帮助淮河泛滥区一千多万农民弟兄摆脱苦难。”工友们明确地认识了治淮工程的政治意义，大大加强了克服任何困难完成任务的信心。亚细亚钢铁厂的生产委员向五金工会主席说：“我们厂里的工人们希望再加些任务。”上海钢铁公司第三厂生产委员向五金工会生产部长说：“没问题，我们保证如期完成任务！”各承造厂的职工们都以忘我的精神投入了澎湃的劳动热潮。
    中国纺织机器公司一厂模型工场预定六天完成任务，结果两天半便完成了。吴淞机器厂工会主席龚志沅同志为了帮助工友们解决生产上的困难，时刻不离现场。他的四岁小女孩病死在医院里，他也没回家一次。妻子哭着找他，他对她说：“我这个任务比一个女孩子重要得多！”许多工友因为日夜突击工作，休息时间较少，两眼熬得通红。上海市五金工会干部下厂慰问时，工友们说：“这样要紧的任务，关系几千万人的生命财产呀，我们辛苦些，算什么呢！”他们并希望五金工会干部普遍了解各厂工作情况，如有那个厂来不及完成任务，他们愿意在自己任务完成后前去帮助。中国纺织机器公司一厂生产小组长谢声源说：“我们工人要和农民团结起来与淮河作斗争，正像中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场与美帝国主义作斗争一样，这是光荣的任务！”在这样高度自觉的基础上，在这样燃烧般的劳动热情下，有什么困难不能克服呢？
            工人和专家发挥无限智慧
    行政领导干部充分发动群众，坚决依靠群众，不但普遍激发了工人们的劳动热情，充分发挥了他们的创造力和智慧，并且使群众的智慧和技术专家的智慧结合了起来。这样，就创造了伟大的奇迹。光就淮河水闸工程的设计来说，这是一个空前庞大而又精密的工作，可是华东工业部技术室在三个星期内便基本上完成了这个工作。技术室设计组长戚荣普说：“这是设计组与各承造厂的技术人员以及工人们集体设计的结果。”他举例说：“在设计油缸时，照原来的计划是用无缝钢管。后来发觉存货不够应用，我们便邀请上海钢铁厂、亚细亚、大鑫、中国纺织机器公司等炼钢厂的技术人员来商量，是否可用浇钢来代替。同时又考虑到如果用浇钢来代替，机器工厂加工时是否有困难；于是又邀请了虬江、吴淞等机器厂技术人员来共同商量。大家讨论之后，认为可以用浇钢来代替，并决定了钢的成份。各机器厂的技术人员一致认为加工上无问题。设计组便决定用浇钢来代替无缝钢管。集体设计，对我们来讲，还是一种新的工程设计方式。在过去，设计人员设计一种工程时，往往不顾到材料的困难和各厂设备及技术条件，单凭自己的意图设计，以致常常发生设计好的图样拿到工厂里去制造时发生困难。用集体设计方法就不会发生这样的问题了。有了这次经验，我们相信：今后有任何新颖而艰巨的工程设计，采取集体设计的办法，都可以顺利地完成。”
    在制造机件的过程中，各承造厂职工群众同样发挥了高度的创造性，解决了无数材料上和技术上的严重困难。吴淞机器厂工会主席龚志沅同志说：“在这次工作中，遇到什么困难，工会就召集大家开会，把困难说出来，要大家共同研究想办法；结果困难都解决了。”该厂职工最初在车毛坯，烧焊时，里表都是毛坯，用白钢刀开慢车，一刀要走十一小时三十分，刀子也磨损了。经大家研究改用金钢刀开快车，结果一小时四十分便可走到头。油压机设备既复杂又巨大，在中国还没有制造过。活塞筒上盖及底座部分浇铸配件所需钢水的数量，已超过上海各钢铁厂的生产能力。但由于工人和技术人员们发挥了高度的创造能力，将上盖及底脚板两件改用铸铁，解决了钢水不够的困难。中国纺织机器公司第一厂的炼钢炉内的矽砖拱穹垮下来了，眼看将要影响交货日期。工人们不肯任其停炉，决定采用热修方法。虽然条件还不够，如缺乏御热设备等，可是他们用废钢盖住了火，又用铁板档遮着一部分炉墙，便一个掉换一个地跳进炉腔内，进行砌补工作。经过两小时多的艰苦工作，终于胜利地完成了修补工作，使浇铸任务于五月五日全部完成。上海冷铸厂劳动模范祁元龙团结技术人员，共同研究后解决了铸铁的缩空和夹砂问题。吴淞机器厂徐章华小组在技术室把淮河水闸的高压油泵上的一种零件的图样发下来时，细心研究，发现图样上的螺丝有错误，及时纠正了过来，避免了很大的损失。又如大鑫机器厂清理部门朱学章和电割小组李殿均等，集体创造了用高气压一次直割油压筒的方法，使工作效率提高了三倍多。
            从实践中提高了思想认识
    淮河水闸工程的如期完成，将使一千三百万农民、四千万亩良田免受灾害。在这次伟大的生产实践中，上海五金工人受到了生动的工农联盟思想的教育。而且通过这个奇迹似的创造，教育了各方面的干部和群众，改变了某些工厂行政领导干部对工人群众和工会的看法。例如亚细亚钢铁厂行政方面过去不相信工会在生产中能起多大作用，和工会的关系搞得也就不大好；现在开始重视工会了，和工会的关系也就开始好转了。吴淞机器厂行政领导方面过去在工作中单靠行政命令，现在懂得了依靠工会来发动工人群众了。有了这次经验，工会如何面向生产的问题也基本上解决了。上海市五金工会委员会在这次工程完成以后，紧接着就把工友们的生产热情，继续贯彻到向马恒昌小组竞赛运动上去。
