Examination of Patriotic Pacts Begins Across the Country

Recently, various regions have begun to examine their patriotic pacts. Under the unified leadership of the Nanjing Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Branch, various sectors and district branches in Nanjing, in addition to mobilizing their respective units for general inspections, have also selected key areas for in-depth inspection. Factory and enterprise workers in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places are combining the increased production and donation campaign to examine and revise their patriotic pacts. The Fuzhou City Federation of Trade Unions in Fujian convened a meeting of responsible persons from various industrial trade unions to discuss methods for comprehensively examining patriotic pacts. It was decided that each industrial trade union should first conduct a study on the examination of patriotic pacts, learning from the People's Daily editorial "Widely Establish and Conscientiously Implement Patriotic Pacts." After the examination, each unit should make a summary, formulate regular methods for implementing and examining patriotic pacts in the future, and promote the widespread establishment of patriotic pacts in units that have not yet established them. Qixian County in Pingyuan Province has generally examined the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts in various localities of the county. The industry and commerce federations in Yuechi County, North Sichuan, and Jiading County, South Jiangsu, have all comprehensively examined the performance of the industrial and commercial sectors in fulfilling their patriotic pacts. The Nanchang Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Branch has conducted in-depth inspections of the patriotic pacts of various municipal-level agencies and organizations in the city. Many regions have made the examination of patriotic pacts a key focus in examining the overall work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

Wherever regions have conducted a serious examination of the implementation of patriotic pacts, they have achieved good results. First of all, the leading organs have learned about the progress of the patriotic pact campaign from the examination, discovered problems, and initially summarized the experience of promoting patriotic pacts. For example, the county and district leading organs in Qixian County, Pingyuan Province, successively discovered fifteen typical villages with good performance in implementing patriotic pacts during the examination, enabling the leading organs to more clearly appreciate the enormous role of patriotic pacts in consolidating the achievements of the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement, uniting and organizing the broad masses, and promoting various tasks. They have begun to consciously focus on examining, summarizing, and promoting these typical experiences, and have formulated plans for promoting patriotic pacts in June and July. After examining the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts in various factories, the Nanjing Hardware Trade Union obtained three points of experience in promoting patriotic pacts: First, the establishment of patriotic pacts must have a clear purpose. When the Nanjing Radio Factory began to establish its patriotic pact, it clearly recognized that the patriotic pact should be combined with production. Therefore, they first started by examining production, incorporating the conditions for the labor competition of the groups and the guarantee of the completion of the production plan into the patriotic pact, and put forward clear and specific goals. As a result, the patriotic pact was practical and feasible, and easy to examine, making it easy to discover and solve problems, and the patriotic pact promoted production. Conversely, some units did not have a clear understanding of the purpose of establishing patriotic pacts, and even held incorrect attitudes such as "joining in the fun." As a result, the established patriotic pacts did not work. Second, the work related to patriotic pacts in factories is best led by the trade union, with dedicated personnel responsible. All units that have done this have achieved certain results. In some units, the patriotic pact work had no dedicated person in charge, causing confusion in leadership and inspection, and even forming a spontaneous flow. Third, patriotic pacts should not only be inspected, but also have a regular inspection system. For example, Jiang Hanmin and He Yongzhang's groups at the Radio Factory have introduced inspectors who regularly divide their responsibilities to inspect the pacts and established a system of commendation and criticism. Therefore, the implementation of the patriotic pacts is relatively good. Conversely, some units have not established an inspection system, or have stipulated an inspection system but cannot implement it regularly, so the patriotic pacts have not been implemented.

Some regions or units have promoted the current central work through the examination of patriotic pacts. For example, aphids occurred in the first, second, and fourth districts of Qixian County, Pingyuan Province. After examining the patriotic pacts, everyone, in order to realize the provision in the pact "Fight against nature, immediately eliminate insect pests when they occur, and ensure bumper harvests," immediately organized to eliminate aphids. The second village of Shoujian Township in Yin County, Zhejiang Province, launched a drought resistance campaign among farmers through the examination of patriotic pacts, and dug three canals in two days to divert water for irrigation. The preparatory committee of the industry and commerce federation in Yuechi County, North Sichuan, mobilized industrial and commercial households in urban areas to conduct self-examination and mutual criticism to generally examine the implementation of patriotic pacts, and uncovered many illegal behaviors such as tax evasion, tax evasion, and shoddy workmanship. After mutual criticism and self-examination among industrialists and merchants, a group of activists emerged. The county's tax collection work has also been greatly improved.

After examining the patriotic pacts, many units revised the patriotic pacts based on the problems found in the examination and according to advanced experience, and established an inspection system. Some regions or units have included the increased production and donation campaign and doing a good job in preferential treatment work as important contents of the patriotic pacts.

When Nanjing City conducted a general examination of patriotic pacts, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial suggesting that districts and sectors should examine the implementation of patriotic pacts according to three standards: First, is the content of the patriotic pact specific? Examining according to this standard can enable everyone to understand how to combine patriotic political tasks with specific businesses; understand that the patriotic pact must be specific in order to achieve everything. Second, is the patriotic pact widely established? Which units have established it? Which have not? Is the established one a large scope, a large unit, or a small scope, a small unit? Examining according to this standard can know whether the establishment and implementation of the patriotic pact has penetrated into the people or floats on the surface? Third, is there leadership after the patriotic pact is established? (Is there a dedicated person in charge? Is there an inspection? Is there commendation and criticism? Is there a regular summary?) For units with better performance in implementing patriotic pacts, summarize their experiences, improve and promote them. The newspaper also suggested that the city's anti-American aggression and aid Korea branches and various sectors should organize working groups, led by responsible persons, to personally conduct key inspections in one or two units. Select representative typical units (such as those with good performance in implementing patriotic pacts, those with poor performance, and those that have not implemented them at all), conduct investigations and research, analyze the situation, and draw conclusions.

According to Nanjing's experience, before and during the examination of patriotic pacts, publicity and education should be carried out to the masses to make everyone understand the purpose of the examination, and a rigid attitude should be avoided during the examination to avoid causing concerns among the masses. In addition, in order to make the inspection work proceed quickly and deeply, it is best to organize activists among the masses and let them take the lead in self-examination and mutual examination.

### 各地开始检查爱国公约

　　各地开始检查爱国公约
    最近各地已纷纷开始检查爱国公约。南京市各界，各区的抗美援朝支会，在该市抗美援朝分会的统一领导下，除了动员所属单位进行普遍性的检查以外，都选择了重点作深入的检查。北京、天津等地的工厂、企业职工，正结合增产捐献运动，检查和修订爱国公约。福建福州市总工会召集各产业工会负责人举行了会议，讨论了普遍检查爱国公约的办法，并决定各产业工会在检查前首先展开关于检查爱国公约的学习，学习人民日报社论《广泛订立并认真执行爱国公约》；检查后各单位应作出总结，订出今后经常的执行与检查爱国公约的办法，并推动没有订立爱国公约的单位广泛订立。平原省淇县已普遍检查该县各地订立与执行爱国公约的情况。川北岳池县和苏南嘉定县的工商联合会组织，都全面检查了工商界履行爱国公约的情况。南昌市抗美援朝分会，曾深入检查了该市各市级机关、团体的爱国公约。许多地区在检查整个的抗美援朝工作中，都把检查爱国公约作为重点。
    各地凡是对爱国公约履行情况作了认真检查的，都获得了良好的效果。首先是领导机关从检查中了解了推行爱国公约运动的情况，发现了问题，并初步总结了推行爱国公约的经验。如平原省淇县县、区领导机关在检查中先后发现了执行爱国公约成绩较好的十五个典型村，使领导机关更清楚地体会到爱国公约在巩固抗美援朝运动成果，团结组织广大群众，推动各项工作方面的巨大作用，他们已开始有意识地抓紧检查总结和推广这些典型经验，并拟具了六、七月份推行爱国公约的计划。南京市五金工会在检查了各工厂订立与执行爱国公约的情况之后，取得了推行爱国公约的三点经验，即：一、订立爱国公约必须有明确的目的性。该市有线电厂在开始订立爱国公约时，就明确认识到爱国公约应与生产相结合，因此他们就首先从检查生产着手，把小组的劳动竞赛条件与保证生产计划的完成等都订入了爱国公约，并提出了明确的、具体的奋斗目标，因此爱国公约切实可行，而且易于检查，便于发现问题和解决问题，爱国公约推动了生产。相反地，有的单位对订立爱国公约的目的没有明确的认识，甚至抱着“凑热闹”等不正确的态度，结果订出来的爱国公约不起作用。二、工厂中有关爱国公约的工作，最好由工会领导，推专人负责。凡是这样做了的单位，都得到了一定的成绩。有的单位因为爱国公约工作无专人负责，使领导与检查产生紊乱现象，甚至形成自流。三、爱国公约不但要有检查，而且要有经常性的检查制度。如有线电厂蒋汉民、贺咏璋两小组，都推出了检查员，经常分工负责分条检查公约，并建立了表扬与批评制度，因此，爱国公约的履行情形都比较好。相反地，有些单位没有建立检查制度，或规定了检查制度而不能经常执行，爱国公约就未能贯彻执行。
    有的地区或单位，通过检查爱国公约，推动了当前的中心工作。如平原省淇县一、二、四区发生棉蚜，经检查爱国公约之后，大家为实现公约中“向自然作斗争，发生虫害，立即治除，保证丰产”的规定，立即组织起来扑灭蚜虫。浙江省鄞县首建乡二村，通过检查爱国公约发动了农民的抗旱运动，在两天中掘了三条水渠引水灌田。川北岳池县工商联合会筹委会发动城区各行业工商户以自我检查、互助批评的方法，普遍检查了爱国公约的执行情况，检查出了许多逃税、漏税和偷工搀杂等不法行为。工商业者中经过互相批评与自我检讨以后，涌现出了一批积极分子。该县的税收工作也大为改进。
    许多单位在检查了爱国公约之后，即针对检查中所发现的问题，根据先进经验，发动群众修订了爱国公约，并建立了检查制度。有的地区或单位已把增产捐献运动和做好优抚工作列为爱国公约的重要内容。
    在南京市普遍检查爱国公约时，南京新华日报发表了社论，建议各区、各界要根据三个标准来检查爱国公约的执行情况：一、爱国公约的内容具体不具体？根据这一标准来检查，可以使大家懂得怎样把爱国政治任务与具体业务结合起来；懂得爱国公约必须具体化，才能条条做到。二、爱国公约订得普遍不普遍？有那些单位订了？那些没有订？已经订的是大范围、大单位，还是小范围小单位？根据这一标准来检查，就能知道爱国公约的订立和执行是深入到人民群众中去了，还是浮在上面？三、爱国公约订了以后有没有领导？（有没有专人负责？有没有检查？有没有表扬和批评？有没有定期的总结？）对执行爱国公约较有成绩的单位，要总结他们的经验，加以提高和推广。该报并建议该市各抗美援朝支会、各界都要组织工作小组，由负责人员率领，亲自动手，在一两个单位中进行重点检查。选择有代表性的典型单位（如爱国公约执行有成绩的，成绩不大的，根本未执行的），加以调查研究，分析情况，得出结论。
    据南京市的经验，检查爱国公约开始前与进行中，应向群众进行宣传教育，使大家明了检查的目的，检查时并应避免采取生硬的态度，以免引起群众的顾虑。另外，为使检查工作进行迅速而又能深入，最好组织群众中的积极分子，由他们带头作自我检查与互相检查。
