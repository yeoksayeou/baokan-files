To the Editor:

    We have seen the letter from reader Mr. Renfu, published on May 13th, regarding the Cantonese Opera *Cai Zhongxing Builds Luoyang Bridge* and the Peking Opera *Zhong Kui* performed by the Shang Xiaoyun Troupe. These two plays do indeed contain serious feudal superstitious elements, especially the latter, which is full of ghosts on stage, creating a gloomy and terrifying atmosphere. They are fundamentally in conflict with the provision in the standards for reviewing repertoire set by the Ministry of Culture's Drama Improvement Committee of the Central People's Government, which opposes promoting feudal slave morality and superstition that numbs and intimidates the people.

    Our Drama Improvement Division has taken the following actions regarding the above two plays:

    For *Zhong Kui*, our Drama Improvement Division contacted the person in charge of the Shang Troupe's stage affairs during the second performance, and after persuasion, they realized the serious poisonous elements contained in the play. After discussions and revisions, the play was partially modified for the fourth performance (e.g., the small ghosts and monsters at the beginning were changed to robbers, etc.). We are still helping them make further modifications, while also pointing out to the troupe that although the play has been modified, it still contains many superstitious elements and should be performed as little as possible.

    Regarding the Cantonese Opera *Cai Zhongxing Builds Luoyang Bridge*, our bureau also summoned the person in charge of the performing troupe for a discussion, informing them of the drama reform policy and advising them not to stage overly feudal and superstitious old plays again, or to revise them before performing them. On the other hand, since the vast majority of Cantonese operas currently being performed in Shanghai are old and contain stale content, we are now beginning to collect old Cantonese opera scripts to understand their content in preparation for further review.

### 对于“反对迷信、恐怖的戏”的答复

专栏：读者来信

    对于“反对迷信、恐怖的戏”的答复编辑同志：
    我们看到了五月十三日发来的读者人夫先生的来信，对于粤剧《蔡中兴建造洛阳桥》与尚小云剧团演出的京剧《钟馗》的意见。这两个戏的确都存在着严重的封建迷信的毒素，特别是后者，满台的鬼出现，阴森恐怖。它们基本上是与中央人民政府文化部戏曲改进委员会关于剧目审定标准中所反对的宣扬麻醉与恐吓人民的封建奴隶道德与迷信的一项相抵触。
    我局戏曲改进处对上面两个戏，曾作了的处理：
    对于《钟馗》，我局戏曲改进处在该剧团演出第二场时，即约尚剧团剧务方面负责人谈话，经过劝导说服，使他们认识了该剧所含的严重毒素，谈后经过研究修正，因此该剧在第四场演出时，已经作了部分的修改（如前面的大小鬼怪改为强盗等）。现在我们还在帮助他们作进一步的修改，同时向剧团指出：该剧虽经修改，但是仍然存在着很多的迷信毒素，还是应该尽量减少演出。
    对于粤剧《蔡中兴建造洛阳桥》一剧，我局也曾召集演出的剧团负责人谈话，告以戏改政策，并且劝导他们对一些过分封建、迷信的旧剧不再上演，或修改之后再演出。另方面因目前上海上演之粤剧绝大多数是旧剧，且内容陈腐，现正着手搜集粤剧旧剧剧目，了解其内容，以作进一步审定之准备。
