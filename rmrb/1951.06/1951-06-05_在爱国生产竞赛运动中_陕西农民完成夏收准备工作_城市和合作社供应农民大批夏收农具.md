　　In the Patriotic Production Emulation Drive
    Shaanxi Peasants Complete Summer Harvest Preparations
    Cities and Cooperatives Supply Peasants with Large Quantities of Summer Harvest Farm Tools
    The peasants in the wheat-producing areas of Shaanxi Province have completed all preparations for the summer harvest and summer selection, and are now welcoming the wheat harvest with great joy. In the earlier-season southern Shaanxi area, harvesting has already begun, and the Guanzhong area will also begin harvesting within the week. It is estimated that the average harvest for the entire region this year will be over 80%.
    The wheat planting area in the Guanzhong area this year has expanded by one-tenth compared to last year. This spring, the area of ​​weeding in wheat fields accounted for 90% of the total planting area, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Since the 47 mutual aid teams in Xingping County initiated the challenge of the summer harvest and summer selection competition, nearly a thousand mutual aid teams in more than twenty counties have responded enthusiastically. Other regions of the province have also launched competitions between townships and townships, villages and villages, and mutual aid teams and mutual aid teams. Under the influence of this patriotic production emulation drive, the peasants in the wheat-producing areas of the province have generally repaired or purchased the farm tools needed for the wheat harvest, and completed various preparations for the wheat harvest in advance. Ironware stores in Xi'an City sold 320,000 sickles alone to farmers in various counties. Various places have also generally established wheat protection organizations with male and female militia as the core, patrolling day and night to protect wheat fields. Field identification and block selection of wheat have been carried out in some areas. In order to ensure that the purity of the selected wheat seeds reached 95%, the peasants of Douma Village in Xingping County, including more than 1,400 men and women in the village, removed the miscellaneous ears in the 5,000 mu of "302" purebred wheat fields in ten days.
    In order to help the peasants successfully complete the summer harvest and summer selection tasks, governments at all levels, organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels, various people's organizations, and relevant professional institutions have dispatched cadres to go deep into the countryside to specifically lead and help the peasants carry out the summer harvest and summer selection work. The Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China lent 1.7 billion yuan in wheat harvest loans to peasants in parts of Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi who lacked farm tools to purchase farm tools. The Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Bureau also sold or lent 120,000 brooms, 10,000 wooden forks, and 40,000 sickles to farmers and cooperative members at low prices through cooperatives in various places. At the same time, it purchased a large amount of early-maturing crops such as rapeseed, thereby solving the difficulty of the shortage of food for some farmers during the period of food shortage. These have greatly encouraged the peasants' enthusiasm for harvesting wheat.

　　在爱国生产竞赛运动中
    陕西农民完成夏收准备工作 
    城市和合作社供应农民大批夏收农具
    陕西省产麦区的农民已完成夏收夏选的一切准备工作，现正以万分喜悦的心情迎接麦收。在季节较早的陕南地区，现已开始收割，关中地区周内也可开镰。预计全区今年平均可有八成以上的收成。
    关中区今年的小麦播种面积较去年扩大十分之一。今春麦田锄草面积占总播种面积百分之九十，较去年增加百分之三十。该区自兴平县四十七个互助组发起夏收夏选竞赛的挑战后，截至现在为止，仅二十余县已有近千个互助组热烈响应。全省其他地区也展开了乡与乡、村与村、互助组与互助组之间的竞赛。在这个爱国生产竞赛运动的影响下，全省产麦区的农民已普遍整修或添购了麦收所需要的农具，并提前完成了收麦的各项准备工作。西安市五十余家铁货店卖给各县农民的农具仅镰刀一项即达三十二万张。各地并普遍建立了以男女民兵为核心的护麦组织，日夜巡逻放哨，保护麦田。部分地区已进行了麦子田间鉴定和块选。兴平县窦马村农民为使所选小麦良种的纯度达到百分之九十五，全村男女一千四百余人曾在十天内拔除了五千亩“三零二”号纯种麦田内的杂穗。
    为帮助农民顺利完成夏收夏选任务，各级人民政府、中国共产党的各级组织、各人民团体及有关的专业机关，均分别派出干部深入到农村去具体领导和帮助农民进行夏收夏选工作。中国人民银行西北区行以十七亿元的麦收贷款，贷给关中、陕南部分缺乏农具的农民购买农具。陕西省合作局并通过各地合作社以低价卖给或贷给农民社员扫帚十二万把，木杈一万个，镰刀四万张，同时大量收购了油菜等早熟作物，从而解决了部分农民青黄不接时期短少口粮的困难。这些都大大鼓舞了农民的收麦情绪。
