　　Review of Several Popular Small Dictionaries

　　1. *New Dictionary of Words* Edited by Wei Jinzhi, Shanghai Qiming Bookstore, First Edition, February 1951
　　2. *People's Small Dictionary* Edited by Li Dafang et al., Beijing Jianye Bookstore, First Edition, January 1951
　　3. *Mass Small Dictionary of Words* Newly Edited by Yao Nailin, Shanghai Central Bookstore, Second Edition, January 1951
　　4. *Five-Purpose Small Dictionary* Edited by Zhou Xingchu, Yaguang Cartography Society, Revised Second Edition, October 1950
　　5. *Four-Corner Code New Dictionary* Edited by Zhao Tingwei et al., Commercial Press, First Edition, August 1950

　　The above five small dictionaries are all relatively popular reference books. The compilation intentions or revision processes of these books are as follows:

　　*New Dictionary of Words* is an adaptation of the *Dictionary of Words* published in 1937, "to increase or decrease the content of the Dictionary of Words to suit the needs of middle school students and vocational youths" (from the original book's preface).

　　The editors of *People's Small Dictionary* "aimed at students in general primary and secondary schools, workers' and peasants' quick literacy middle schools, vocational schools, and workers, peasants, and soldiers with equivalent cultural levels" (*Editorial Intentions*).

　　The scope of *Mass Small Dictionary of Words* is "completely suitable for the general public and middle school students to check single characters and word meanings" (*Explanatory Notes*).

　　*Five-Purpose Small Dictionary* is intended to "facilitate the practical application of social figures, middle school students, and primary school teachers" (*Editorial Intentions*).

　　The editors of *Four-Corner Code New Dictionary* "aimed at high school students in primary schools and junior high school students and the general public with equivalent levels," and "pointed out various traditional explanations of feudal nature, and revised them based on new viewpoints" (*Editorial Intentions*).

　　Today, workers, peasants, and soldiers have a high enthusiasm for learning culture, and middle school students have a high enthusiasm for pursuing new knowledge. It is very good that compilers and publishers compile, revise, and publish some new small dictionaries in order to meet the needs of the masses. Precisely because of this, these small dictionaries sell very well. However, have these books well accomplished their compilation intentions? This is still worth investigating.

　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×

　　First of all, there are too many political errors in these small dictionaries. After reading the few examples given below (in the examples, the order of the five books in the title is followed, marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively, without noting the book name), it can be understood how serious the political errors are.

　　I. Ignorance of current world politics, or unclear knowledge, and incorrect explanations.

　　For example, in explaining the names of countries, (1), (3), and (4) mostly explain the United States as "a republic in North America," but the word "republic" is also used to describe countries like the New Democratic Poland, which confuses the enemy and the friend. (2) Explains the United States as "an imperialist country where capitalism has developed to the final stage in the world," which is acceptable; but when explaining "England," it only says that it "is one of the capitalist countries in Europe," and the explanation of "France" is even simplified to "a country name in Europe." Is the United States the only imperialist country?

　　Taking "Vietnam" as an example, (2), (3), (4), and (5) do not mention Vietnam, a newborn people's democratic country. (1) Explains it as "is Annam." What is Annam? The same book explains: "Originally a vassal of our country, annexed by France in the twelfth year of Guangxu." In the hands of our compilers, this people's democratic country that emerged in Southeast Asia since August 1945—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—is completely ignored.

　　Also, (5)'s explanation of the "Western European Bloc": The purpose of the Western European Bloc "is to confront the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe" and is "a defensive alliance of Western European countries." Such an explanation not only fails to point out the aggressive nature of the Western European Bloc but also uses the words "confrontation" and "defensive alliance," which clearly becomes an echo of the imperialists' anti-Soviet and anti-communist slanders because the imperialists habitually use words like "defense" and "resistance" to cover up their unspeakable military aggression conspiracy.

　　II. Using the views of imperialists and reactionary rulers to explain political terms:

　　1. Colony—A residence governed by officials sent by the mother country and implementing the laws of the mother country (1), (3), (4); the overseas territories of a country are commonly called colonies (5).

　　2. Protectorate—A country protected by a powerful country (1); a weak country protected by a powerful country (3); a country without the ability to manage its internal affairs and diplomacy is placed under the supervision and protection of another country, and it is called a protectorate of that country (5).

　　3. Secret Agent—A technical position assigned to a certain part of a party or organization, such as: detective, protection, etc. (1).

　　In the above examples, reactionary views of the bourgeoisie are inherited: The first and second examples portray the aggressive behavior of imperialists as reasonable; the third example completely conceals the anti-people nature of the reactionary ruling class and all reactionaries using secret agents. (Moreover, the writing is illogical!)

　　III. Distorted explanations of historical events and historical figures. Let's give a few examples:

　　1. Boxer Rebellion—In the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Boxers excluded foreigners, and the allied forces of England, Russia, Germany, France, Japan, the United States, Italy, and Austria attacked Beijing (1).

　　2. Boxers—Also called the Righteous Harmony Society... Advocated "Support the Qing, Destroy the Foreign," opposed imperialist aggression, and because of destroying churches and attacking embassies, there was the disaster of the Eight-Power Allied Forces (1).

　　From the above explanations of the "Boxer Rebellion" and the "Boxers," it is clear that the "disaster" of the Eight-Power Allied Forces is blamed on the Boxers' "exclusion of foreigners"—"destroying churches and attacking embassies"—thus, the erroneous conclusion that "opposing imperialist aggression" is guilty is reached.

　　3. Li Hongzhang—Famous minister of the Qing Dynasty, contributed to suppressing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom... (3)

　　4. Li Zicheng—Bandit during the late Ming Dynasty (4).

　　5. Yellow Turbans—Rebel party in the late Eastern Han Dynasty (4).

　　These are all praising counter-revolutionary "meritorious officials" while slandering revolutionary peasants.

　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×

　　Secondly, these small dictionaries have many shortcomings in terms of ideology. For example:

　　1. Immortal—A person who lives forever (1) (4); a supernatural person (3).

　　2. God—The highest heavenly god (5).

　　3. Demon—Strange ghost (5) (4); a ghost that makes trouble (1).

　　There is no critical explanation of superstition in gods and ghosts at all.

　　1. Chastity—The virtue of a woman not remarrying after her husband's death (4).

　　2. Vulgar Person—A person without knowledge and not of high moral character (5).

　　3. Way of a Concubine—Base behavior (1).

　　When explaining these old words, how can we not point out the reactionary essence of its feudal contempt for women and contempt for the working people? If it is not pointed out now, are we going to call on readers to "learn" those ways of "chastity" and despise the working people who are called "vulgar people"?

　　1. Land Rent—The rent paid by tenants to landlords (1).

　　2. Profit—The legitimate profit obtained in production (2); the profit after deducting expenses in business (1).

　　3. Capital—Materials used for exploitation are called "capital" (2); "capital" is the capital of commerce (2); capital for operating industries, attempting to make profits (1); the capital of business (2); money used to operate industries, hoping to make profits from it (4).

　　For these words, we should certainly give a popular and commonly used explanation, but we must also explain its essence to help readers improve their thinking. For example, the explanation of land rent must mention the land ownership system; the explanation of profit must mention the nature of profit and the source of profit. Not popularizing scientific ideological content, but only popularizing the meaning of the text, is a vulgar practice that should be opposed. The first explanation of the word capital made by *People's Small Dictionary* in example (3) is particularly absurd. According to this explanation, the capital that must be accumulated in the process of moving towards socialism and communism also becomes "materials used for exploitation."

　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×

　　There are also many linguistic errors in these small dictionaries. The most serious is the *People's Small Dictionary*. Here are some examples to illustrate.

　　I. Words and phrases are not distinguished and are annotated randomly, for example:

　　1. Three—Uncertain consciousness, (Example) Two or three virtues, wavering; 2. Top—Grade, (Example) Superior, top-grade, upper-class; 3. Dan (red)—Painting, (Example) Danqing (painting); 4. Generation—Passing down; (Example) Passed down through generations; 5. Light—Suddenly seeing light again in the dark is called restoration; 6. Matter—Pronoun, (Example) In charge.

　　II. The meaning of the words is fundamentally wrongly annotated, for example:

　　1. Bian (biased)—Unexpected, (Example) Insist on doing so; 2. Er (child)—Pronoun in colloquial language, (Example) There; 3. Fen (divide)—Has the meaning of vice, (Example) Branch school, branch institute; 4. Gui (women's quarters)—The small door inside the imperial palace in the feudal era; 5. Xun (sacrifice)—Sacrificing one's life for the revolution is called xun (sacrifice), (Example) Martyrs died for their duty. (Note: This is a mistake of using the word "xun" for "martyr.")

　　III. Lacking common sense of textual research, dividing the same meaning of a word into several items, for example:

　　1. Ji (near)—Nearby, (Example) Within sight but out of reach; has the meaning of agreement, (Example) Neither close nor distant. 2. Chong (full)—Satisfaction, (Example) Sufficient; many, (Example) Foreign goods are rampant; plump, (Example) Full, filled. 3. Jian (firm)—Meaning of unwavering, (Example) Firm, resolute; having a certain force is called firm, (Example) Adhere to the truth.

　　IV. Plagiarizing annotations from other large dictionaries, resulting in inconsistencies with current meanings or being completely incomprehensible, for example:

　　1. Friend—Comrades are called friends; 2. Tang (hall)—The road in the temple is called Tang; 3. Hai (laughter)—Chu people call teasing hai; 4. Ci (quick)—Meaning of quick as flying, (Example) "Ci Fei"; 5. Dong (ignorant)—Appearance of lacking knowledge, (Example) Ignorant of those behind; 6. Chu (begin)—Beginning, (Example) Chu Zhen; 7. Kuang (hurried)—Very hurried appearance, (Example) Kuang Kuang.

　　Examples like the above can be said to be "easily found everywhere" in this small dictionary; as for the incomprehensible annotation, the inappropriate emphasis on the words collected, the disordered order of the sub-entries, and the errors in pronunciation, they are too numerous to list.

　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×

　　After pointing out the important errors in these small dictionaries above, let's talk about the reasons for these errors and the individual evaluations of them.

　　Among them, the second and fifth are newly compiled after liberation. The second one is a typical example of shoddy workmanship, worthy of the comment "full of errors." The errors committed by this book are that the compilers ignore the basic sense of responsibility for publications and lack the necessary knowledge and even general common sense. The fifth one has a rich collection of new and old words, and many explanations are correct. However, due to the limitations of ideological and political level, the viewpoints are not clear enough, so that many languages of class enemies are unconsciously conveyed in some clauses, or outdated antiques are moved out without criticism. But this dictionary is basically good.

　　As mentioned earlier, *New Dictionary of Words* is an adaptation of the 1937 edition of *Dictionary of Words*, only "increasing or decreasing the content of the Dictionary of Words." One aspect of the errors in this book is that the compilers are limited by ideological and political levels, and the work of removing dross is not done enough. On the other hand, as editor-in-chief Wei Jinzhi said in the preface, because he "could not concentrate on the work" during the adaptation, there were many "rough places." As an editor-in-chief, he only "did some proofreading work," and this proofreading work was really not enough, so this "new" dictionary of words is still old in essence.

　　*Five-Purpose Small Dictionary* does not state the year of the first edition and the revision process. Judging from the "preface" in the book, it was undoubtedly published during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It may have had some revisions during the "revised second edition in October 1950," but the revisions were very incomplete. It does not state the period of the first edition on the copyright page, which obviously has some "passing off fish eyes as pearls" effect.

　　The most absurd is the *Mass Small Dictionary of Words*. It is basically a replica of an old book. In this book, which claims to be the "second edition in January 1951," in the thirty-fifth explanation under the word "country," the country name is explained as "Republic of China," the national flag is the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth Flag," the National Day is October 10th, the Kuomintang is "our country's revolutionary party with nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood as its principles," and there are also bizarre words such as "National Government," "National Government Committee Member," and "National Revolutionary Army." This is an intolerable speculation and deception, an inexcusable absurd and shameless behavior. Due to this kind of speculation and deception, this book can still be sold everywhere. According to readers' reflections, the Huaxin Yarn Factory Primary School in Tangshan even designated it as a small dictionary for children. This influence is really terrible. (The Shanghai Wenhui Daily supplement published the accusations of two readers against the small dictionary on June 12. We found that in addition to the so-called "second edition in January 1951," there are also the "September 1950 edition" and the "revised second edition in February 1951." Although the Central Bookstore has made a review, it lightly covered these serious errors with the words "negligence in inspection." Although this book has been discontinued, thoroughly changing this bad style is more important.)

　　Today, the vast number of readers urgently need a good dictionary or dictionary. They often see a newly published small dictionary and buy it like "eating anything to relieve hunger." Zhou Ke, a primary school teacher in the Yimeng Mountain area, made the best explanation of this psychology when he commented on the *Five-Purpose Small Dictionary*: "Due to the difficulties in teaching new words and explaining nouns, we must rely on dictionaries, and we all regard dictionaries as treasures. Furthermore, because the old dictionaries in the past often have some reactionary and feudal explanations, we dare not use them when our political and cultural level is not enough to make precise criticisms. Recently (Editor's note: The letter came in February), I heard that the Xinhua Bookstore in this county (Yinan County) has a batch of new *Five-Purpose Small Dictionaries*, and the teachers happily bought a copy, thinking that we could rely on it in teaching, but after careful investigation, this book is still such an old thing."

　　Based on this situation, we cannot but require compilers and publishers to take out the spirit of honestly serving the people to do a good job in publishing. It can be seen from the publication of these dictionaries that rectifying the atmosphere of the publishing industry is still very important.

　　(Royalties donated to purchase airplanes and cannons)

　　Editor's Note: This critical text is a rewritten success based on a combination of many submissions. These submissions include: 1. Feng Jing of Shanghai's criticism of "New Dictionary of Words"; 2. Zhang Jianmu of Beijing's "Review of 'People's Small Dictionary'"; 3. Xie Mingyi of Nanjing's opinion on "Four-Corner Code New Dictionary"; 4. Wu Zaibo of Yangcun, Gao Fengzao of Tangshan, Zhang Yuting of Xian County, Dong Ronglu of Tianjin, Liu Jingxiang of Dalian City and the Vocational Education Group of the Yinxinzhuang Complete Primary School in Jingxian, Hebei's accusations against "Mass Small Dictionary of Words"; 5. Zhou Ke of Jiehu Primary School in Yinan County, Shandong, Yao Lishen of Rehe Kazuo Banner Mongolian Middle School, Zhu Xiangqing and other seven people of Shandong Military Region, Sun Jishi of Jiaoxian County, Liu Chuan of Tanggu and Li Zuoshan of Angangxi, Heilongjiang, and many others' criticism of "Five-Purpose Small Dictionary." Thanks should be given to these contributors. We have not individually sought consent and have donated the royalties due to them for the purchase of airplanes and cannons, which we believe will be approved.

　　It should also be pointed out that the vast readership indeed urgently needs a good popular small dictionary. We hope that authors and publishers can meet the needs of readers as soon as possible. Among the above-mentioned small dictionaries, the "Four-Corner Code New Dictionary" is still a better one. Today, since there is no perfect small dictionary, we can only hope that readers: 1. Should choose carefully when buying books; 2. After purchasing, they must still use it critically and cannot have a completely trusting attitude.

　　评几种通俗性的小辞典
    一、《新词林》魏金枝主编上海启明书局一九五一年二月初版
    二、《人民小字典》  李大方等主编  北京建业书局一九五一年一月初版
    三、《大众小辞林》  姚乃麟新编  上海中央书店一九五一年一月再版
    四、《五用小辞典》  周性初编  亚光舆地学社一九五○年十月增订再版
    五、《四角号码新词典》  赵廷为等编  商务印书馆一九五○年八月初版
    上举的五种小辞书都是比较带通俗性的工具书。这几种书编纂的企图或改编增订的经过是这样的：
    《新词林》是将一九三七年出版的《辞林》改编，“把辞林内容，加以增减，以切合于中学生及职业青年的需要”（原书序言）。
    《人民小字典》的编辑“是以一般中小学、工农速成中学、业务学校的学生和文化程度相等的工农兵大众为对象”（《编辑大意》）。
    《大众小辞林》编辑的范围，“完全适合于一般民众和中小学生检查单字和词义之用”（《凡例》）。
    《五用小辞典》是为了“便利社会人士，中小学生及小学教师的实际应用”（《编辑大意》）。
    《四角号码新词典》的编辑，“以小学高年级及初中学生与同等程度的一般人民大众为对象”，“对于封建性的各种传统解释，分别指出，根据新观点加以修正”（《编辑大意》）。
    今天工农兵群众学习文化和中小学生追求新知识的热情都很高，编著者和出版者为了满足群众的需要而编纂、修订出版一些新的小型辞书，这是很好的。正因为这样，这些小辞书销行很广。可是，这些书是不是很好地完成了编纂企图呢？这还是很值得考究的。
        ×                        ×                      ×
    首先，这些小辞书中间存在的政治错误太多了。看了下面举出的少数例子（在举例中均按标题中五书的顺序，分别标明一、二、三、四、五，不注书名），就可以明白政治错误严重到怎样的程度。
    一、对目前世界政治显得无知，或知道的不清楚，说明得不正确。
    例如解释各国国名，（一）（三）（四）解释美国大都作“北美洲的共和国”，但“共和国”这个词又却同样用来说明像新民主主义的波兰这样的国家，这就混淆了敌友。（二）解释美国，说它是“世界上资本主义发展到最后阶段的帝国主义国家”，是可以的；可是在解释“英国”时却只说它“是欧洲资本主义国家之一”，解释“法国”更简化为“欧洲的国名”，难道帝国主义国家只有美国一个吗？
    再以“越南”为例，（二）（三）（四）（五）都没有提到越南这一个新生的人民民主国家。（一）解释为“就是安南”，安南是什么呢？同书解释：“本为我国藩属，光绪十二年，为法国所并。”在我们编著者的笔下，就完全没理会自一九四五年八月出现在东南亚的这一个人民民主国家——越南人民共和国。
    还有，（五）对于“西欧集团”的解释：西欧集团的目的“在对抗苏联及东欧新民主主义国家”，是“一个西欧各国的攻守同盟”。这样的说明既没有指出西欧集团的侵略本质，而且用上“对抗”，“攻守同盟”字样，很显明地是变成了帝国主义者反苏、反共谰言的应声虫，因为帝国主义者正是惯用“防守”、“抵抗”这类字眼，来掩饰它不可告人的军事侵略阴谋。
    沿用帝国主义、反动统治者的观点解释政治名词：
    １、殖民地——由母国派官治理，并施行母国法律的居留地（一）、（三）、（四）；国家的海外属地普通称作殖民地（五）。
    ２、保护国——受强国保护的国家（一）；弱国的受强国的保护者（三）；没有自理内政、外交能力的国家，受别国的监督和保护，就称为某国的保护国（五）
    ３、特务——一个党或一个团体中，规定由某部分担任的技术职务，例如：侦探，防护等是（一）。
    在上列几个例子中，都是因袭了资产阶级的反动观点：第一、二例把帝国主义者的侵略行为说成了合情合理；第三例完全掩蔽了反动的统治阶级以及一切反动派运用特务的反人民的本质。（而且文理不通！）
    三、对于历史事件和历史人物的歪曲解释。试举数例：
    １、庚子之役——清朝光绪二十六年庚子，义和团排斥外人，英俄德法日美意奥组织联军攻入北京的事件（一）。
    ２、义和团——又叫义和拳………倡“扶清灭洋”，反对帝国主义侵略，因毁教堂，攻使馆，随有八国联军的祸事。（一）
    从以上对“庚子之役”和“义和团”的解释看来，很显明地是把八国联军的“祸事”归咎于义和团的“排斥外人”——“毁教堂，攻使馆”——这样，就要得出“反对帝国主义侵略”是有罪的谬误结论来了。
    ３、李鸿章——清朝名臣，平太平天国有功；………。（三）
    ４、李自成——明末流寇。（四）
    ５、黄巾——东汉末的乱党。（四）
    这都是表扬反革命的“功臣”而诬蔑革命的农民。
        ×                              ×                    ×
    其次，这些小辞书在思想性上的缺点也很多。例如：
    １、神仙——长生不死的人（一）（四）；灵异的人物（三）。
    ２、上帝——最高的天神（五）。
    ３、妖魔——怪异的鬼物（五）（四）；作怪的鬼物（一）。
    对于神异鬼怪的迷信，竟一点也没有批判的说明。
    １、贞节——妇女于丈夫死后不再嫁的美德（四）。
    ２、俗人——没有学识而人格也不高尚的人（五）。
    ３、妾妇之道——卑贱的行为（一）。
    在解释这些旧词时，怎能够不把它的封建性的鄙视妇女、鄙视劳动人民的反动本质指出来？现在不指出来，难道要号召读者“学习”那些“贞节”之道，鄙视那些被称为“俗人”的劳动人民吗？
    １、地租——佃户纳给田主的租（一）。
    ２、利润——生产上所得的合法利益（二）；营业除去耗费后的利益（一）。
    ３、资本——用以进行剥削的物资叫“资本”（二）；“资本”是商业的资金（二）；经营实业，企图生利的本钱（一）；营业的本钱（二）；用以经营实业，希望靠此生利的钱财（四）。
    对于这些词语，我们固然应给以通俗性的、习用的解释，但也必须说明其实质，才可以帮助读者思想上的提高。如地租的解释，不能不提到土地的占有制度；利润的解释，不能不提到利润的性质和利润的来源。不在科学思想内容上去进行通俗化，只在文义引伸上去通俗化，是一种应该反对的庸俗作法。第（三）例中举出的《人民小字典》对资本一词所作的第一解释尤其荒谬，照这个解释演绎起来，在走向社会主义、共产主义中所必须积累的资本，也成为“进行剥削的物资”了。
      ×                        ×                          ×
    这些小辞书中，语文方面的错误也很多。最严重的是《人民小字典》。举出如下的例子来说明。
    一、字和词没有加以区分，胡乱注解的，例如：
    １、三——意识不定，（例）二三其德，三心二意；２上——等级，（例）上级、上等、上层；３、丹——图画，（例）丹青；４世——递传；（例）世代相传；５、光——在黑暗中忽然重见光明叫光复；６、事——代名词，（例）执事。
    二、把字的意义根本注解错误的，例如：
    １、偏——出乎不意，（例）偏要如此；２、儿——口语的代名词，（例）那儿；３、分——有副的意思，（例）分校，分院；４闺——封建时代皇宫里边的小门；５、徇——不惜身命，为革命而牺牲叫徇，（例）烈士徇职。（按：这是把“殉”字误做“徇”字了。）
    三、缺乏训诂常识，把字的同一个意义分列做好几条的，例如：
    １、即——就近，（例）可望不可即；有合的意思，（例）不即不离。２、充——满足，（例）充足；众多，（例）外货充斥；丰满，（例）充盈，充满。３、坚——无所动摇的意思，（例）坚定，坚决；有一定力叫坚，（例）坚持真理。
    四、把其他大型辞书中的注解生吞活剥地采入，以致与现在的意义不符或是根本不可解的，例如：
    １、友——同志叫友；２唐——庙中的路叫唐；３、咍——楚人谓调笑叫咍；４、佽——轻快如飞的意思，（例）“佽飞”；５、侗——没有知识的样子，（例）在后之侗；６、俶——开始，（例）俶真；７、劻——很急的样子，（例）匡劻。
    像以上的例子，在这一本小辞典中可以说是“俯拾即是”；至于注解的文理不通，收词的轻重失当，分条注解的次第凌乱，注音的错误，更是举不胜举。
          ×                            ×                    ×
    上面指出这些小辞书的重要错误，下面再说一说造成这些错误的原因和对它们个别的评价。
    其中二、五两种是解放以后新编的。第二种是粗制滥造的典型，够得上加上一个“错误百出”的评语。这本书所犯的错误是编著者忽视对出版物的起码的责任心，缺乏必要的知识乃至一般常识。第五种搜罗新词、旧词都很丰富，有很多解释是很正确的。但由于思想、政治水平的限制，观点不够明确，以致在若干条文上不自觉地传达了不少阶级敌人的语言，或是不加批判地搬出了陈腐的古董。但这本词典基本上还算是好的。
    《新词林》如前文所述，是一九三七年版《辞林》的改编本，只把“辞林内容，加以增减”。这本书的错误一方面是编著者受思想、政治水平的限制，剔除糟粕的工夫做得不够，另一方面正如主编人魏金枝在序言中所说在改编时因为“不能专心从事”，以致有很多“粗枝大叶的地方”。作为一个主编人，他只“做了点校订工作”，而这种校订工作实在太不够，以致这一本“新”辞林，本质上还是旧的。
    《五用小辞典》没有载明初版年月和修订经过，从书中“序言”上看，它无疑是在国民党反动派统治时出版的。它可能在“一九五○年十月增订再版”时有过一些修订，但修订得很不完全。它不在版权页上载明初版时期，显然有些“鱼目混珠”的作用。
    最荒谬的是《大众小辞林》。它根本就是旧书的翻版。在这一本号称“一九五一年一月再版”的书里，在“国”字下的三十五条解释中，解释国号是“中华民国”，国旗是“青天白日满地红旗”，国庆日是十月十日，国民党是“我国以民族、民权，民生为主义的革命政党”，还有“国民政府”、“国府委员”、“国民革命军”这些光怪陆离的词语。这是一种不能容忍的投机、欺骗，不可饶恕的荒唐无耻的行为。由于这一种投机、欺骗行为，竟使得这一本书还能行销各地，甚至据读者反映：唐山华新纱厂小学还指定它为孩子们用的小字典。这影响实在坏透了。（六月十二日上海文汇报副刊发表了两位读者对该小辞林的指责，我们发觉除了所谓“一九五一年一月再版”本外，还有“一九五○年九月版”和“一九五一年二月再版本”。中央书店虽作了检讨，却把这些严重的错误以“疏忽检查”四字轻轻带过，这本书虽然已经停售，但彻底改变这种恶劣作风，是更重要的。）
    今天广大的读者迫切需要一部好的字典或辞典，他们往往看到一本新出版的小辞书就“饥不择食”似地去购买。沂蒙山区一个小学教师周克对《五用小辞典》所提的意见，可以作这种心理的最好说明：“由于教学上的生字及名词解释的困难，我们都必须依靠字典，我们都把字典当作至宝一般。再由于过去的旧字典常有一些反动、封建的解释，在我们政治、文化水平还不够作精密批判时，我们总不敢用它们。最近（编者按：信是二月间来的）听说本县（沂南县）新华书店来了一批新的《五用小辞典》，教师们都高兴地买了一本，我以为在教学上可以有些依靠了，那知细细探究，这本书还是这样陈旧的东西。”
    基于这样的情形，我们不能不要求编著者和出版者拿出老老实实的为人民服务的精神，来搞好出版工作。从这些辞书的出版上，可以看出整肃出版界的风气还是很重要的。

    编者按：这篇批评文字是综合了许多来稿改写成功的。这些来稿包括：一、上海冯京对《新词林》的批评；二、北京张建木的《评“人民小字典”》；三、南京谢名溢对《四角号码新词典》的意见；四、杨村吴在波、唐山高凤藻、献县张玉亭、天津董荣禄、旅大市刘竞翔和河北景县阎新庄完全小学职教员学习组对《大众小辞林》的指责；五、山东沂南县界湖小学周克、热河喀左旗蒙民初中姚立身、山东军区朱襄卿等七人、胶县孙继世、塘沽刘船和黑龙江昂昂溪李佐善等多人对《五用小辞典》的批评。应该对这些来稿人致谢。我们没有个别地征求同意，已把应得的稿费捐献作购买飞机大炮之用了，想来一定可以得到赞同的。
    还须要指出的：目前广大的读书界确确实实迫切需要一本优良的通俗性的小辞书，希望著作者和出版者能及早满足读者的需要。在上列几种小型辞书中，《四角号码新词典》还算是较好的一种。在今天，既然还没有一本十分完善的小辞书，我们只能希望读者们：一、在购书时应该审慎地选择一下；二、在购买以后，还得批判地使用，不能抱完全信任的态度。
