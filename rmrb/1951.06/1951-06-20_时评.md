　　Current Affairs Commentary

　　(I) Popularize the "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Labor Day"

　　The comrades of the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, on June 2nd, upon reading the "Call on Promoting Patriotic Pacts, Donating Airplanes and Cannons, and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Servicemen" of this association, established a patriotic production increase and donation group, and stipulated that Sunday be "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Labor Day" (the first labor day was June 3rd), with all wages earned donated to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the front lines. Later, their group expanded and joined forces with comrades from the Fifth District Office of Beijing and the Fifth District Trade Union Office to form a patriotic labor brigade. At the same time, workers, office staff, students, and people in cultural and educational circles in Beijing and other places have also successively launched various forms of physical and intellectual labor-based patriotic production increase and donation labor days. Their spirit of patriotism is worthy of being emulated by the people of the whole country. The emergence and promotion of this patriotic labor day system, pioneered by Communist Party members and other patriotic activists, will make a huge contribution not only to strengthening support for the front lines but also to advancing the great cause of production and construction in our great motherland. This heroic working spirit of the people in the rear, combined with the heroic fighting spirit of our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front lines, is the guarantee that we will be able to completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors.

　　In order to universally promote and persistently maintain the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic labor day system, and to give full play to the great role of this system, there are several issues that local leading organs need to help resolve. The first is to organize these laborers. With the widespread development of patriotic labor groups, the number of newly emerging laborers will be very large. Local people's governments need to help them find suitable work in a planned way and use this as an opportunity to promote the development of production and construction. The second is to pay attention to regulating the working hours of each labor group, so as not to make the patriotic labor day too long or too frequent, in order to avoid affecting the health of those participating in the labor group and their normal work duties. Generally speaking, during the period of production increase and donation for Resist America, Aid Korea, working one day (eight hours) or two half-days a month is more appropriate and easier to implement. The third is to encourage everyone to participate in patriotic labor for Resist America, Aid Korea in various forms, according to their specialties, the convenient conditions of each unit, and their personal physical conditions, occupations, and family circumstances. Only in this way can everyone participate in patriotic labor and make this labor a huge force for patriotic donation and a huge force for economic construction.

　　(II) Focus on advocating the signing of patriotic pacts in small units

　　In the proclamation issued by this association on June 1st, it called on the people of the whole country to universally carry out the patriotic pact movement and pointed out that the two central tasks of the current Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, namely increasing production and donating weapons and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen, should be listed as important contents of the patriotic pacts.

　　Promoting patriotic pacts is an important form for leading the masses to organize themselves for self-education, an important form for raising the patriotic enthusiasm and political awareness of the masses, and a basic link for promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the current central tasks of the country; and in order to make the patriotic pact movement a truly mass movement, it is necessary to focus on advocating that all small units sign patriotic pacts. Therefore, the proclamation of this association on June 1st stated: "We suggest that all people from all walks of life, all factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets, and villages across the country, all workshops, production groups, and study groups in factories, all kinds of production mutual aid groups and study groups in rural areas, all work departments in institutions, all departments or classes and groups in schools, and even every family and other production and work units, etc., all formulate specific patriotic pacts according to their own business, around the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, or add to the original pacts; and select leaders to establish a permanent leadership core to lead everyone to realize these pacts."

　　The joint or separate patriotic pacts of people from all walks of life with cities and counties as the scope are needed, because this larger-scale patriotic pact can appropriately combine the general task of patriotism of the people of the whole country with the current central work of various places, thus providing a correct direction for the specific patriotic pacts of small units. However, in order to truly deepen the patriotic pact movement into the masses, and closely combine the general task of patriotism of the people of the whole country and the central work of various places with the daily work of the masses in the patriotic pacts of the masses, it is far from enough to only have large-scale patriotic pacts, and it is also necessary to focus on mobilizing the masses in the units where the masses are combined at the lowest level to sign specific patriotic pacts of small units. Among the organized masses, patriotic pacts should be signed all the way down to the group (including production, work, and study groups; in institutions, it is the smallest division of labor unit); among the general unorganized masses, it should be signed all the way down to each family. Only in this way can patriotic pacts truly become a common form of political life for the masses, and can fully play its role in organizing the masses, educating the masses, and promoting work.

　　In this regard, the experience of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau in formulating and revising patriotic pacts in various production groups and the experience of more than 1,000 residents in Guiyang City in formulating family patriotic pacts, which are introduced in this issue of this journal, are worthy of reference by various places. Other good experiences created in this work in other places should also be promoted.

　　(III) Deeply mobilize religious believers to hold good accusation meetings in religious circles

　　The movement of patriotic Christian and Catholic believers in various places to accuse American imperialism of using religion to invade our country is underway. This struggle is completely in line with the truth and is completely necessary. This struggle is not only a matter for patriotic Chinese religious believers, but also a matter of interest to all Chinese people, and is part of the entire cause of the Chinese people against imperialist oppression. Therefore, the Resist America, Aid Korea sub-committees, the religious affairs departments of the people's governments in various places, and the people of the whole country should encourage and help patriotic activists among Chinese religious believers, mobilize all religious believers to participate in this patriotic movement of great significance, and strive for the complete victory of this movement.

　　According to existing experience, in order to hold good accusation meetings in religious circles, it is first necessary to go through universal publicity and education to dispel the ideological concerns of religious believers. In the past hundred years, imperialism has used religion to commit many evils in China. However, due to the long-term deception by imperialists and their running dogs appearing as missionaries, most religious believers often mistakenly regard these bandits as devout religious leaders, or incorrectly believe that religious believers should "conceal evil and promote good" and should not casually "judge" people. Therefore, most religious believers are unwilling to participate in accusation meetings before they are awakened. To overcome this ideological obstacle, the best way is to combine the current political situation with the facts of imperialist, especially American imperialist, aggression against our country under the guise of religion that have been exposed in various places to enlighten the patriotic consciousness of the religious masses, so that they can recognize that imperialists and Chinese reactionaries are irreconcilable enemies of the Chinese people, thereby helping them to correct the incorrect idea of adopting an attitude of "concealing evil and promoting good" towards the enemies of imperialist elements. Holding good accusation meetings in religious circles is a patriotic cause of the masses of Chinese religious believers, therefore, it must first be nurtured to maturity among the religious believers, and must be carried out by the religious masses themselves on the basis of the improved patriotic understanding and enthusiasm of the majority of religious believers. Any idea and practice of doing everything for them or making patriotic activists isolate themselves among the religious masses is wrong and will be used by imperialists as a tool to provoke the unity between Chinese religious believers and non-religious believers, thereby undermining the patriotic movement of Chinese religious believers.

　　Secondly, preparations should be made before the accusation meeting, the main ones being: first, widely collect materials on the crimes of imperialist elements and their running dogs among the religious masses and other aspects, and carefully and correctly select the targets of accusation. It is necessary to strictly distinguish between the running dogs of imperialism (these people account for only a very small number) and the people who are deceived and used by imperialists and their running dogs, and strictly guard against the conspiracies of imperialist elements and their running dogs to provoke discord. Second, find typical figures of accusation by means of personal visits or holding small forums, etc., and help them organize materials and encourage them to accuse at the conference. In the two major movements of Resist America, Aid Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the experience in many places has proved that organizing accusation meetings in this way can achieve the expected effect of educating the masses.

　　Finally, religious accusation meetings are a serious struggle between patriotic religious believers and imperialist forces, and are a complex and meticulous organizational work. Strong leadership is indispensable. In order to hold good accusation meetings, Christians in Hefei City specially established a preparatory committee for the accusation meeting, which is specifically responsible for leading and controlling the accusation meeting. This approach is worthy of reference by various places.

　　时评
    （一）推广“抗美援朝爱国劳动日”
    中国共产党北京市第五区委员会的同志们，在六月二日读到本会“关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召”的当天，就成立了爱国增产捐献小组，并规定星期日为“抗美援朝爱国劳动日”（第一个劳动日是六月三日），以所得工资全部捐献出来购买飞机大炮，支援前线。以后他们的小组已经扩大，并和北京第五区区公所、第五区工会办事处的同志们联合组成了爱国劳动大队。同时，在北京以及其他各地的工人、机关职员、学生及文化教育界群众中，也纷纷出现了各种体力劳动和智力劳动的爱国增产捐献劳动日。他们的这种爱国主义的精神，是值得全国人民学习的。由共产党员和其他爱国积极分子所首倡的这种爱国劳动日制度的出现及其推广，不但对于加强支援前线，而且对于加强我们伟大祖国生产建设事业的推进，都将有巨大贡献。后方人民的这种英勇工作精神，和我国志愿军及朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线的英勇作战精神配合起来，就是我们必能全部消灭帝国主义侵略者的保证。
    为着普遍推行和长期坚持抗美援朝爱国劳动日的制度，并发挥这个制度的伟大作用，有几个问题须要各地领导机关设法帮助解决。第一就是要把这些劳动力组织起来。随着爱国劳动小组的普遍发展而来的新出现的劳动者的人数将是很大的，须要各地人民政府有计划地帮助他们找到适当的工作，并借以推进生产和建设事业的发展。第二就是要注意调节各劳动小组的劳动时间，不要使爱国劳动日时间过长，次数过多，以避免影响到参加劳动小组者的健康和他们的正常工作业务。一般地说来，在抗美援朝的增产捐献期间，每个月劳动一天（八小时）或两个半天是比较适当的，也是比较容易行得通的。第三就是要鼓励大家根据各人专长、根据各单位的便利条件，及各个人身体状况、职业和家庭状况，以各种形式来参加抗美援朝的爱国劳动，只有这样，才能使人人都来参加爱国劳动，才能使这种劳动成为巨大的爱国捐献力量和巨大的经济建设力量。
            （二）着重提倡在各小单位订立爱国公约
    本会在六月一日发出的文告中，号召全国人民普遍开展爱国公约运动，并指出应该把当前抗美援朝的两件中心工作，即增加生产捐献武器及优待烈属军属，列为爱国公约的重要内容。
    推行爱国公约，是领导群众组织起来进行自我教育的重要形式，是提高群众的爱国热忱和政治觉悟的重要形式，是推动抗美援朝运动以及国家当前各项中心工作向前发展的基本环节；而为了使爱国公约运动真正成为群众运动，又应该着重地提倡各小单位都来订立爱国公约。因此，本会六月一日的文告说：“我们建议全国所有各界人民，各工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道和农村，工厂中的各个车间、生产组和学习组，乡村中的各种生产互助组、学习组，机关中的各个工作部门，学校中的各个院系或班、组，以至各个家庭和其他各种生产工作单位等，都按照自己的业务，围绕着抗美援朝运动，订出具体的爱国公约，或增订原来的公约；并且选出领导人，建立经常的领导核心，领导大家来实现这些公约。”
    以市、县等地方为范围的各界人民共同的或分别的爱国公约，是需要的，因为这种较大范围的爱国公约，可以把全国人民爱国的总任务和各个地方当前的中心工作适当地结合起来，因而可以为各小单位的具体的爱国公约提示正确的方向。但是，要使爱国公约运动真正深入群众，使全国人民爱国的总任务、各地的中心工作与人民群众的日常业务在群众的爱国公约中密切地结合起来，光有大范围的爱国公约是十分不够的，还必须着重地在最下层的群众结合的单位发动群众订立小单位的具体的爱国公约。在有组织的群众中，爱国公约应该一直订立到小组（包括生产、工作和学习小组，在机关是最小的分工单位）；在一般无组织群众中，应该一直订立到每个家庭。只有这样做，爱国公约才能真正变为群众普遍的政治生活形式，才能充分发挥它的组织群众和教育群众和推进工作的作用。
    在这方面，本刊本期所介绍的北京电信局在各生产小组订立和修订爱国公约的经验和贵阳市一千多户居民订立家庭爱国公约的经验，是值得各地参考的。其他各地在这个工作中也创造了许多好的经验，也是应该加以推广的。
            （三）深入发动教徒，开好宗教界的控诉会
    各地基督教与天主教爱国教徒对美帝国主义利用宗教侵略我国的控诉运动，正在开展。这个斗争是完全合乎真理的、完全必要的。这个斗争不但是爱国的中国教徒的事情，而且是关系全中国人民利益的事情，是全中国人民反对帝国主义压迫的整个事业的一部分。因此，各地抗美援朝分会、人民政府的宗教事务部门和全国人民都应该鼓励和帮助中国宗教信徒中的爱国积极分子，把所有教徒都动员起来，参加这个意义重大的爱国运动，争取这个运动的全部胜利。
    根据已有的经验，要开好宗教界的控诉会，首先要经过普遍的宣传教育，以解除教徒的思想顾虑。近百年来，帝国主义利用宗教，在中国造下了许多罪恶。但一般教徒因长期受着帝国主义者及其走狗以传教士面目出现的欺骗，往往误认这些匪类为虔诚的宗教领袖，或者不正确地认为宗教信徒应该“隐恶扬善”，不应该随便“论断”人。因此一般教徒在没有觉悟以前，是不愿参加控诉会的。要克服这种思想障碍，最好的方法是结合目前的政治形势，用各地已经揭露的帝国主义特别是美帝国主义披着宗教外衣侵略我国的事实，来启发教徒群众的爱国觉悟，使他们认识帝国主义者和中国反动派是中国人民不可调和的敌人，从而帮助他们纠正那种对于帝国主义分子的敌人采取“隐恶扬善”态度的不正确思想。开好宗教界控诉会，是中国宗教信徒群众的爱国事业，因此，必须首先在教徒中酝酿成熟，必须在多数教徒爱国认识和积极性提高的基础上，由教徒群众自己来进行。任何包办代替的想法和做法，或者是使爱国积极分子在教徒群众中把自己孤立起来的做法，都是错误的，都会被帝国主义者利用了去，作为他们挑拨中国教徒和非教徒人民之间的团结，从而破坏中国教徒爱国运动的工具。
    其次，在控诉会前应该作好准备工作，其中主要的是：第一，在教徒群众中及其他方面广泛收集帝国主义分子及其走狗的罪行材料，慎重地、正确地选定控诉的目标。必须严格区别帝国主义的走狗（这些人只占极少数）和被帝国主义者及其走狗所蒙蔽和利用的人们，严防帝国主义者及其走狗的挑拨离间的阴谋。第二，用个人访问或召开小型座谈会等方式，发现控诉的典型人物，并帮助他们整理材料，鼓励他们在大会上控诉。在抗美援朝和镇压反革命的两大运动中，许多地方的经验都证明，按照这样的方法来组织控诉会，就能使控诉会议达到教育群众的预期效果。
    最后，宗教界控诉会是爱国教徒与帝国主义势力的一场严重斗争，是一件复杂细致的组织工作，没有坚强的领导是不行的。合肥市基督教徒为了开好控诉会，特别成立了控诉大会筹备委员会，专门负责领导和掌握控诉会。这种作法是值得各地参考的。
