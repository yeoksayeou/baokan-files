    The "New Five Punishments" is an Incorrect Term
    To the Editor:
    The People's Daily published an article written by Mr. Chen Yuan on May 25th, third edition, titled "Resolutely Support the New Five Punishments." I believe this statement is very inappropriate.
    In the first paragraph of his article, Mr. Chen Yuan summarized the speeches made by Mayor Peng Zhen and concurrently Director Luo Ruiqing at the enlarged joint meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, calling them "the New Five Punishments of New Democracy." This is specious. What Director Luo said was that there are five methods to "deal with" counter-revolutionaries, not five types of criminal law. One of the five methods is "release," which is outside the scope of criminal law. It is even more inappropriate to compare the five methods of dealing with counter-revolutionaries by the People's Government with the cruel "Five Punishments" of the past feudal ruling class.
                                                 Li Hai
     Editor's Note: The article "Resolutely Support the New Five Punishments" written by Mr. Chen Yuan expressed firm support for the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and its basic spirit is good. However, it is inappropriate to call the five methods of dealing with counter-revolutionaries the "New Five Punishments." We did not consider this carefully when publishing this article, and it was an oversight. Comrade Li Hai's opinion is correct.

### “新五刑”的说法是错误的

    “新五刑”的说法是错误的编辑同志：
    人民日报五月二十五日第三版刊载了陈垣先生所写的“坚决拥护新五刑”一文。我认为这个说法是很不恰当的。
    陈垣先生在该文第一段里，把彭真市长和罗瑞卿兼局长在北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议上讲的话下了一个总结，说是“新民主主义的新五刑”。这是似是而非的。罗兼局长说的是“处理”反革命分子有五种方法，并非五种刑法。五种方法中有一项是“释放”，那就在刑法之外了。把人民政府对反革命分子的五种处理办法与过去封建统治阶级的残酷的“五刑”相提并论，更是不妥当的。
                                                 李海
     编者按：陈垣先生所写“坚决拥护新五刑”一文，其中对政府镇压反革命的政策，表示坚决的拥护，基本精神是好的。但是把处理反革命分子的五种办法叫做“新五刑”，则是不妥当的。我们发表此文时，考虑欠周，是一个疏忽。读者李海同志的意见是正确的。
