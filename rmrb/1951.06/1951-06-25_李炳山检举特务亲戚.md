　　Li Bingshan Exposes Relative Who is a Special Agent
    Li Bingshan, a resident of Group 23, Qingyun Road, Qiqihar City, exposed his relative Wen Kaiyin, who was a special agent.
    Li Bingshan is a small vendor selling braised pork. On the evening of April 14th, he returned home after selling braised pork. His cousin, Wen Chunwang, was waiting for him. As soon as he entered the house, Wen Chunwang said to him, "Brother, my third uncle, Wen Kaiyin, has come to Qiqihar to look for work, can you help him find something?" Li Bingshan's heart stirred. He thought, "Wen Kaiyin is a special agent. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he harmed many anti-Japanese revolutionary comrades in Rongcheng, Hebei Province. His own two nephews died at his hands because they participated in the anti-Japanese underground work. Now he wants to hide in Qiqihar. I cannot harbor him!" After his cousin left, he immediately reported it to the public security police station.
    On the morning of the 15th, comrades from the Public Security Bureau arrested Wen Kaiyin from a dilapidated house in the backyard of Wen Chunwang's home.
    Afterwards, I visited Li Bingshan. He said, "Comrade, look, my arms are different sizes, and my whole body is covered with injuries. I can't do heavy work. This is because I was persecuted by special agents in the past!" He pointed to the newly painted white walls and the furniture on the kang and the ground, saying, "Our good life now is the result of arduous struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and it is not easy to come by! We must defend it. Eliminating counter-revolutionaries is to guarantee our good life."

　　李炳山检举特务亲戚
    齐齐哈尔市青云路二十三组居民李炳山，检举了当特务的亲戚文开印。
    李炳山是个卖酱肉的小贩。四月十四日傍晚，他卖完酱肉回家。他表弟文春望正在等着他。他一进屋，文春望就对他说：“大哥，我的三爷文开印到齐齐哈尔来找事，你帮助给找一找吧。”李炳山心里一动，他想：“文开印是个特务。伪满时，他在河北省容城害了很多抗日的革命同志。他自己的两个亲侄子，因为参加抗日地下工作，也都死在他手下。现在他想隐藏在齐齐哈尔。我不能包庇他！”在他表弟走后，他马上报告了公安派出所。
    十五日早晨，公安局的同志从文春望家后院一座破房子里把文开印逮捕了。
    事后我去访问了李炳山，他说：“同志，你看我的胳膊一个粗一个细，浑身都是伤，硬活干不了，这就是过去被特务残害的呀！”他又指着他家中新刷的粉墙和炕上地下的家俱说：“我们现在的好生活是在共产党、毛主席领导下经过艰苦斗争得来的，这是不容易的！我们一定要保卫它。肃清反革命分子，就是为了保障我们的好生活。”
