I Will Strive to Cultivate New Technical Personnel to Increase the Strength of National Defense and Economic Construction
—Letter from Zou Kuiwen, a Model Worker in Harbin

Respected Chairman Mao:

The 30th anniversary of the Party is fast approaching. I am reporting to you on my work situation since returning from the National Model Workers Representative Conference.

Shortly after returning from Beijing, it coincided with the establishment of a repair and manufacturing factory by the public utility company, and the leadership transferred me to work as a technician. At the beginning of the factory's construction, there were many difficulties, the biggest of which was the lack of technical personnel. At this time, we remembered what you told us: "Build strong national defense forces and economic strength." I also remembered that the Party often teaches us: to build strong economic strength, we should pay attention to cultivating technical personnel. So I discussed it with the trade union, and in January of this year, we held a technical training class with more than 30 apprentices participating. I served as a volunteer lecturer. Now, after more than four months, the average apprentice has reached the theoretical level of a journeyman. By the end, almost all of them could reach the level of intermediate technical workers.

The work of the technical training class has been progressing smoothly with the continuous support and help from the Party organization and the administrative side. Of course, I have also made great efforts. Why did I do this? Because I have been learning fitter work since I was sixteen years old. After four or five years of learning, I still hadn’t become a journeyman. But after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, my political, cultural, and technical level was quickly improved, I served as a technician, joined the Communist Party of China, and was elected as a model worker. Thinking of these things, I feel that I should strive to cultivate a new force in economic construction.

I wish you eternal health!

Zou Kuiwen, Technician of Harbin Repair and Manufacturing Factory

### 我要努力培养新的技术人员  增加国防和经济建设的力量——哈尔滨工业劳动模范邹奎文的信

　　我要努力培养新的技术人员  增加国防和经济建设的力量
    ——哈尔滨工业劳动模范邹奎文的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的三十周年纪念日快要到来了。我向您报告一下我从参加全国劳动模范代表会议回来以后的工作情形。
    刚从北京回来不久，正赶上公用事业公司建立修造厂，领导上就把我调来作技术员。刚建厂，困难多一点，最大的困难，是缺乏技术人员。这时候，我们想起您告诉我们的话：“建设强大的国防力量和经济力量。”我又想起来，党时常教导我们：建设强大的经济力量，应该注意培养技术人员。于是我就和工会商量，在今年一月间，举办了一个技术学习班，有三十多个徒工参加了学习。我担任义务讲师。到现在，四个多月的工夫，一般的徒工都有了帮工匠的技术理论水平。到结束的时候，差不多都可能达到中等技术工的水平。
    技术学习班的工作，经党的组织和行政方面不断地支持和帮助，进行得很顺利。当然，我也作了很大的努力。为什么我要这样作，因为我从十六岁起就学钳工。学了四、五年，还没有当上帮工匠。可是解放后，在党的领导之下，很快地就提高了我的政治、文化、技术水平，担任了技术员，参加了中国共产党，当选了劳动模范。想到这些，我就觉得我应当努力培养一批在经济建设上的新的力量。
        祝您永远健康！
        哈尔滨市修造厂技术员  邹奎文
