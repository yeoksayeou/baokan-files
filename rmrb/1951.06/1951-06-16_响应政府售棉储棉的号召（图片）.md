Responding to the Government's Call to Sell and Store Cotton
　　　　　　　By Lao Ding and Chen Jinyan
　　(Thirteen) Wang Quanfu sold a portion of his cotton to the cooperative and bought cattle, donkeys, carts, wagons, and production tools.
　　(Fourteen) He also dug a well and installed a waterwheel, turning dry land into irrigated land.
　　(Fifteen) The whole family of three put on newly made clothes, and he also made seven quilts and three mattresses; Old man Wang Quanfu's mouth was missing all his teeth, so he had a set of porcelain teeth made.
