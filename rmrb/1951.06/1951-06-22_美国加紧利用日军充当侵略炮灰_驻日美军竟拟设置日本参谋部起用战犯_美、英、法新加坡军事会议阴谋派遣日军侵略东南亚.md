Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Tokyo News: The American imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan, since the U.S. military delegation led by Taylor, director of the Training Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Army, arrived in Tokyo at the end of April to make arrangements, is being intensified. A Japanese General Staff will be established within the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo, and Japanese war criminals will be employed in an attempt to send Japanese troops to participate in the U.S. military's war of aggression in Asia.

After arriving in Japan, the delegation inspected the Japanese Police Reserve Force, the Railway Police Force, and the Fire Brigade. Taylor also pointed out that the Japanese armed forces should strengthen "training for modern warfare." After the inspection, the delegation invited former Japanese military personnel to a meeting. The attendees included: Kazushige Ugaki, Takaji Tanaka, Seizo Arisue, Kaneichi Kamata, Tokutaro Sakurai, and the current commander of the Police Reserve Force, Keiji Masuhara, and others. At the meeting, Taylor stated: "The U.S. military command believes that it is entirely appropriate for the Police Reserve Force to move from the stage of formation and preliminary training to the stage of adapting to the combat environment." In Tokyo, it is widely believed that this statement means that the United States is preparing to have Japanese troops participate in the U.S. Far East aggression army in the near future, and it confirms the U.S. plan to openly send Japanese troops to participate in the Korean War after the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan. Taylor also pointed out that special Japanese units will be established within the U.S. military forces to suppress the people's liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

For this purpose, a special Japanese General Staff will be established at the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo. This General Staff will be composed of former Japanese General Headquarters Planning Bureau and Operations Bureau military personnel. It is planned that the Planning Bureau of the General Staff will be led by former Lieutenant General Kaneichi Kamata, and the Operations Bureau will be led by former Lieutenant General Hideichi Miyazaki. Former fascist military personnel such as Kazushige Ugaki, Torashiro Kawabe, Seizo Arisue, Tokutaro Sakurai, and Keiji Masuhara will participate in the "Military Committee" under Ridgway at the U.S. military headquarters.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Singapore News: The use of Japanese troops to suppress national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries was one of the main issues discussed at the secret military representative meeting of the United States, Britain, and France held in Singapore on May 15th.

U.S. representative Lieutenant General Shipley, who attended the meeting, pointed out at the meeting that due to the accelerated military buildup in Western Europe, it is not convenient to disperse Western countries' troops on the Asian continent. Therefore, other troops should be used in Asia. Shipley said that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that after the conclusion of a (separate) peace treaty with Japan, Japanese troops can be used wherever the West needs them.

Shipley continued: The U.S. military headquarters in Japan is already working on recruiting former Japanese officers and soldiers who have fought in Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, and other places. Some are already in training. Special attention is paid to jungle warfare training for combat troops preparing to be sent to Vietnam and Malaya, and officers and soldiers are often sent to the Korean battlefield to enrich their "experience" and learn "new tactics." In addition, special units using bacteria and poison gas have also been formed.

After pointing out that the reason for the failures of the French army in Vietnam and the British army in Malaya is the lack of so-called qualified commanders, Shipley suggested using former Japanese commanders who fought in the above two regions during the Pacific War as "experts" to be sent to each region.

Shipley also promised to send 150 Japanese drivers to Vietnam and Malaya, all of whom had participated in the U.S. Air Force's war of aggression in Korea. Shipley said: The issue of dispatching a larger Japanese fighter squadron is currently being considered by the Washington authorities and will be resolved soon.

The representatives attending the meeting estimated that the conspiracy of a separate peace treaty with Japan would soon be realized, so they decided that the first batch of Japanese troops to be trained and equipped should arrive in Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and other places before September. The meeting also decided that after the meeting, the representatives of the participating countries should submit suggestions to their respective governments and take measures immediately after obtaining approval to enable the plan to send Japanese troops to Southeast Asia to be realized.

The meeting also discussed the current supply of arms and ammunition. Shipley promised to allocate a portion of the Japanese military supplies stored in U.S. military warehouses and transport them to Vietnam and Malaya soon.

Shipley pointed out that the U.S. military headquarters in Japan will soon complete the transformation of the Japanese state-run arsenals so that they can manufacture arms and ammunition in Japan according to U.S. standards and transport these military supplies to Southeast Asian countries. As early as March 29th of this year, Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that "new special procurement" orders, including the supply of military supplies to Southeast Asia, have entered the implementation stage, and the focus has "shifted from parts to finished products." The fact that Japan has become a U.S. arms factory in Asia is becoming increasingly evident. (Attached pictures)

　　美国加紧利用日军充当侵略炮灰
    驻日美军竟拟设置日本参谋部起用战犯
    美、英、法新加坡军事会议阴谋派遣日军侵略东南亚
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义武装日本的阴谋活动，自美国陆军部组织训练局局长泰勒所率领的美国军事代表团于四月底到东京布置后，正在加紧进行。美军东京总部内并将设置日本参谋部，起用日本战犯，企图派遣日军参加美军在亚洲的侵略战争。
    该代表团抵日后曾检阅日本警察后备队、铁道警察部队与消防队。泰勒并指出，日本武装部队应加强“进行现代战争的训练”。代表团于检阅后并邀请日本旧军人举行会议，与会者有：宇垣一成、田中隆吉、有末精三、镰田诠一、樱井德太郎和现任警察后备队长官增原惠吉等。泰勒在会议中声称：“美军指挥部认为警察后备队从形成和初步训练的阶段，准备走向适应战斗环境的阶段，是完全合乎时宜的。”在东京，众信这一声明意味着美国准备在最近的将来使日军参加美国远东侵略军，并证实了美国将于单独对日和约签订后公开派遣日军赴朝鲜参战的计划。泰勒又指出：在美军部队内将成立特种日本人部队，用以镇压东南亚各地的人民解放运动。
    为此目的，美军东京总部将设立一个专门的日本参谋部。该参谋部由前日本大本营计划局和作战局旧军人组成。预定参谋部的计划局由前中将镰田诠一领导，作战局由前中将宫崎秀一领导。法西斯旧军人宇垣一成、河边虎四郎、有末精三、樱井德太郎和增原惠吉等，则将参加美军总部李奇微属下的“军事委员会”。
    【新华社二十一日讯】新加坡消息：使用日本军队镇压东南亚各国民族解放运动，是五月十五日在新加坡举行的美、英、法三国军事代表秘密会议中讨论的主要问题之一。
    出席会议的美国代表史枢波中将在会上指出：由于西欧的加紧建军，不便于把西方国家的军队分散在亚洲大陆，因而在亚洲应该运用其他军队。史枢波说：美国参谋长联席会议认为，等到（单独）对日和约签订后，即可将日本军队使用到西方所需要的任何地方。
    史枢波继称：驻日美军总部已在着手征募那些曾在越南、泰国、缅甸、马来亚等地作战的前日本官兵，有的已在训练中。对准备派往越南和马来亚的作战部队，特别注意丛林战的训练，其官兵并经常派往朝鲜战地，以充实他们的“经验”和学习“新的战术”。此外还专门组成了使用细菌和毒气的特种部队。
    在指出法军在越南及英军在马来亚之所以遭受失败是由于缺少所谓合格的指挥官之后，史枢波建议利用太平洋战争时候在上述两地区作战的前日本指挥官，以“专家”身份派往各该地区。
    史枢波还答应派出一百五十名日本驾驶员赴越南和马来亚，这些驾驶员都曾参加美国空军在朝鲜的侵略战争。史枢波说：派遣较大的日本战斗机队的问题，目前正由华盛顿当局考虑中，不久即可获得解决。
    出席这个会议的代表们估计对日单独媾和的阴谋不久可实现，因此决定首批训练和装备完毕的日军，应在九月前到达越南、马来亚和缅甸等地。会议并决定：在会议结束后，与会各国代表应向本国政府提出建议，并在获得批准后即采取措施，以便使派遣日军到东南亚的计划得以实现。
    会中并曾商谈目前军械与弹药的补给问题。史枢波答应从储存于美军仓库中的日本军火拨出一部分，于最近运往越南和马来亚。
    史枢波指出，驻日美军总部不久即可完成日本国营兵工厂的改造工作，以便按照美国的标准在日本制造军械和弹药，并把这些军火运往东南亚各国。按早在今年三月二十九日，日本的朝日新闻就曾报导：包括对东南亚军需物资的供应在内的“新特需”订货，已进入实行阶段，其重点且已“由零件转向成品”。日本成为美国在亚洲的军火工厂的事实，已日益昭著。（附图片）
