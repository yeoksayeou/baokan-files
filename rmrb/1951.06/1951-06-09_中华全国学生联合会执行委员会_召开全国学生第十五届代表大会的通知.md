The Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation
Notice on Convening the 15th National Student Congress

I. It has been more than two years since the closing of the 14th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in March 1949. During these two years, the revolutionary situation in China has greatly developed. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. Chinese students, by implementing the correct resolutions of the 14th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation, have made significant improvements in their studies, thinking, and organization on the basis of the nationwide revolutionary victory and under the new democratic education. Based on the above situation, in order to more universally and deeply carry out the patriotic movement against U.S. aggression and aid Korea among students and to further improve academic performance, preparing to better serve the defense and construction of the motherland, the 14th Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation has decided, in accordance with its constitution, to convene the 15th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in Beijing on July 20, 1951.

II. The main contents of this Congress are:
    (1) Summarizing the experience of the Chinese student movement in the past two years;
    (2) Determining the current specific tasks of Chinese students;
    (3) Revising the Constitution of the All-China Students' Federation;
    (4) Re-electing the Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation.

III. Method of selection of representatives and allocation of quotas for this Congress:
    (1) Regional student representatives: Taking provinces (autonomous regions) and cities (municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities under the jurisdiction of greater administrative areas) as units, in principle, one representative is selected for every 5,000 students in secondary schools and above, but there should be different ratios for senior high schools, specialized colleges, universities, and junior high schools. Those with a remainder of less than 5,000 but more than 2,500 can elect one additional representative, and provinces with less than 5,000 students can also select one representative. In areas with a large number of ethnic minority students, this ratio can be appropriately relaxed. Based on the above principles and the specific conditions of various regions, the allocation of representative quotas for each major administrative area is as follows:
    North China: 41
    Northeast: 38
    Northwest: 25
    East China: 100
    Central South: 104
    Southwest: 45
    Inner Mongolia: 2

    Student federations in major administrative areas shall allocate the number of representatives to each province and city according to the above principles. Student federations in each province and city can elect representatives by election or other means according to the specific conditions of each region.

    In provinces and cities where student federations have been established, the student federations shall be responsible for the election of representatives; in provinces and cities where student federations have not been established, the higher-level student federations shall entrust the local education authorities and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to assist in the selection of representatives. (The selection of representatives from Taiwan Province students will be notified separately by the Federation.)

    (2) Overseas Chinese student representatives: The selection will be notified separately by the Federation.
    (3) Representatives of students studying abroad: The selection will be notified separately by the Federation.
    (4) Invited representatives: In order to encourage students to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to establish model banners for student integration with workers, peasants, and soldiers, this Congress has specially established invited representatives. Those who have left school for no more than two years and have participated in land reform, military cadre schools, the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, industrial and agricultural construction, scientific research, and cultural, educational, and artistic work, and have performed excellently, will be invited by the student federations of major administrative areas to attend the Congress (students participating in military cadre schools will be directly invited by the Federation). The quota of invited representatives in each region is as follows:
    North China: 6
    Northeast: 6
    East China: 8
    Central South: 8
    Northwest: 5
    Southwest: 5
    Inner Mongolia: 1

IV. When selecting representatives, student federations in various regions should pay attention to the broad representation of the representatives. The representatives should include students of different genders, different ethnic groups, different types and different natures of schools, and the heads of major provincial and municipal student federations.

V. When electing representatives, student federations and student unions in various regions can widely solicit proposals or suggestions for the Congress from students, and then summarize and organize them for the representatives to submit to the Congress for discussion.

VI. Student federations in various provinces and cities should collect and organize the following materials and reports and send them to the Federation before June 30th of this year:
    (1) Work summary of the past two years. (Including the situation and experience of carrying out study and extracurricular activities, the current health status of students, and the welfare work of student federations, reports can be written on the specific experience of one or two cities or one or two schools.)
    (2) Summary of the student anti-American and patriotic movement. (Reports can be written on the specific experience of one or two tasks).
    (3) Various statistical materials of student federations in various regions. Such as the number of student federations, staffing, the number of student unions, etc.
    (4) Books, periodicals, photos, exhibits, etc. related to the student movement.

VII. Student federations in various regions should report the list of representatives attending the Congress and their resumes to the Federation before June 30th of this year. Representatives from various regions should bring a letter of introduction from the local student federation and report to the Federation at No. 17 East Chang'an Street, Beijing from July 15th to 17th.

VIII. Travel expenses to Beijing for representatives from various regions will be reimbursed by the respective regions, and return travel expenses will be issued by the Congress. Meals during the meeting will be provided by the Congress.

IX. In order to hold this Congress well, student federations in various regions should earnestly and fully prepare for various tasks, and in conjunction with the current central work and the specific conditions of various regions, publicize the significance and purpose of this Congress among the broad masses of students, and call on all students to take practical actions of further carrying out the patriotic movement against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and working hard to study to greet the convening of this Congress, which marks the victorious advance of students across the country under the great banner of patriotism!
