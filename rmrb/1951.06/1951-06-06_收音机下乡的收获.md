　　Gains from Bringing Radios to the Countryside
    Left Ying
    Bringing radios to the countryside has already proven in April, amidst the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, to be an effective method for conducting propaganda and education among the broad masses of rural residents. Wherever radios were brought to the countryside, significant results were invariably achieved. According to incomplete statistics from sixty-seven counties in Hebei Province, including Dingxian, Xushui, Linqing, Fangshan, Jin County, Xingtai, Yi County, and Xian County, one hundred and sixteen radios were organized to go to the countryside in late April, or the radios were moved to the streets to organize the masses to listen one thousand three hundred and fifty-five times, with a total audience of three hundred and seventeen thousand nine hundred and eighty-two people, of which one hundred and forty-three thousand six hundred and sixteen people participated in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the armed rearmament of Japan, and three thousand and forty-six people conducted accusations in front of the radio after listening. In Chahar Province, incomplete statistics from only Zhangjiakou (excluding factories, troops, and schools), Xuanhua, Datong, Tianzhen, Yanggao, Huailai, Yanqing, Wanquan, Zhuolu and other cities and counties organized one hundred and sixteen thousand five hundred and six people to listen. In addition, the CPC Huxi District Committee of Pingyuan Province, jointly with the Shan County Committee and other four units, organized four radios and one slide projector to go to the countryside for propaganda. In ten days, they organized one hundred thousand and two thousand four hundred people to listen, accounting for about one-third of the population of the districts and villages they visited. These places were precisely the blank spots and marginal districts and villages in the region's patriotic education. In Fucheng County, Pingyuan Province, a radio operator went to the countryside for propaganda for ten days, organizing sixty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-two people from nearly two hundred villages to listen, and the vast majority of them signed and voted after listening. Other places, such as Tuoketuo and Wudong Banner of Suiyuan, and Qian County, Jingyang, Liquan, and Sanyuan Counties in the Northwest, also achieved great results with radio operators carrying radios to the countryside for propaganda.
    The love of the broad masses of rural working people for broadcasting is touching. As soon as they hear that the radio has come to the countryside, they completely forget the fatigue of the day. Some people even forget to eat and go to listen to the broadcast in groups. With their active help, radio work is well carried out in the countryside. Before you arrive, tables and benches are already prepared. If you say you need to put up an antenna, someone immediately climbs to the top of a tree to help you tie the rope. When listening, someone helps you maintain order, and everyone automatically refrains from making loud noises that affect the listening. At this time, the radio operator becomes the most popular propagandist, and everyone remembers every word of the broadcast. Therefore, the strata mobilized by broadcasting in the countryside are very broad. Rural women who never participate in social activities come to listen, and old grandmothers and grandfathers also run more than ten miles to listen.
    Broadcasting to the countryside has become a good tool for carrying out current affairs propaganda in rural areas. As long as the radio has been to a place, the broad masses of peasants understand the general principles of resisting America and aiding Korea. This is not only manifested in their active participation in signing and voting, but also in their specific actions. After listening, many places held forums or accusation meetings in conjunction with the blood and tears experienced by the local masses. For example, Yanggao successively organized forty-six people to accuse, and Tianzhen organized thirty-eight people. When Jin County organized listening to the "Small Accusation Meeting in Lianzhuang Village, Zhuoxian County" in the countryside, the village cadres first organized eighteen households who had suffered the most from enemy harm to listen. Before they finished listening, twenty people from the eighteen households cried with tears streaming down their faces. The combination of live accusations and broadcast accusations had a particularly great educational effect on the masses. After listening, the miners of Babao Mountain also formulated a patriotic covenant. After listening to the broadcast, all the teachers and students of Shifangyuan Elementary School in Linqing immediately formulated a patriotic covenant, determined to intensify their studies and expand propaganda. After listening, the farmers in the first district of the county formulated four patriotic covenants, and the group leaders signed them at the listening session, guaranteeing to complete the cotton planting task on schedule. In some places, farmers spontaneously initiated donations after listening to the broadcast. Just as an old farmer in Gudicun, Jin County, said, "When it comes to opposing the American arming of Japan, not to mention signing and voting, I am willing to give money." Farmers in Audi, Liquan, Shaanxi, did not have cash, but they insisted on donating, and took out the eggs from their homes. The masses in Xihe Village, Tianzhen, spontaneously proposed to donate three eggs each to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces and Korean refugees.
    This time, while conducting current affairs propaganda, bringing radios to the countryside also directly promoted rural production. For example, in Hebei, farmers in various places expressed that they would grow more cotton. Zhang Chunzhen from Bajiazhai, Jize County, said: "I originally planned to grow four mu of cotton, but since listening to the radio report, I have become aware and want to grow nine mu." Zhang Huairu from Xixiamachi, Julu, said: "I know what America is. I want to grow more cotton to express my determination to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our country!" There are many similar examples.
    In addition, bringing radio propaganda to the countryside also enriched the cultural life of the rural masses.
    The above facts show that bringing radios to the countryside is indeed a good way to conduct propaganda and education for the broad masses of working people. Therefore, radio operators in various places should continue to carry radios to the countryside, provided that it does not hinder the organization of cadres from listening, copying and recording broadcasts, publishing mimeographed newspapers and blackboard newspaper materials, or in the case of having two or more radios, so as to promote the advance of resisting America, aiding Korea, production, and other rural work.

　　收音机下乡的收获
    左荧
    收音机下乡，已经在四月间普及与深入抗美援朝运动中证明是对于广大农村居民进行宣传教育的有效办法之一。凡是发动了收音机下乡的地方，无例外地都收到了很大的效果。据河北省定县、徐水、临清、房山、晋县、邢台、易县、献县等六十七县的不完全统计，四月下旬即组织了一百一十六架收音机下乡，或将收音机搬到街头，组织群众收听了一千三百五十五次，听众达三十一万七千九百八十二人，其中有十四万三千六百十六人参加了拥护缔结和平公约签名和反对武装日本的投票，有三千零四十六人收听后在收音机前进行了控诉。察哈尔省仅张家口（不包括工厂、部队、学校）、宣化、大同、天镇、阳高、怀来、延庆、万全、涿鹿等市、县的不完全统计，即组织了十一万六千五百零六人收听。另外，平原省中共湖西地委联合单县县委等四个单位，组织了四部收音机和一部幻灯下乡宣传，十天功夫组织了十万零二千四百人收听，约占所到区村人口的三分之一强，收听后举手赞成签名投票的有八万八千四百多人。而他们所去的地方正是该区爱国教育的空白点和边缘区村。平原省复程县收音员下乡宣传了十天，组织了将近二百个村庄的六万八千八百八十二人收听，绝大多数人在听后举行了签名和投票。其他如绥远的托克托和武东县旗下营，西北的乾县、泾阳、醴泉、三原等县，收音员背着收音机下乡宣传，也收到了很大成效。
    广大农村的劳动人民热爱广播的情形是感动人的。他们只要一听到收音机下乡了，就会完全忘掉了一天的劳累，有的人连饭也顾不上吃，成群结队地去听广播。在他们的积极帮忙下，收音工作在农村是很好开展的。你还没到，桌子板凳早就给预备好了。你说需要架天线，立刻就有人爬上了树梢帮你拴绳，收听时有人帮你维持会场，大伙自动地不许大吵大嚷影响收听。这时，收音员就成了最受人欢迎的宣传员，广播的每一句话大家都记得牢牢地。所以，广播在农村里动员的阶层是很广泛的，从来不参加社会活动的农村妇女也来听，上了年纪的老太太老爷爷们也跑了十几里路来听。
    广播下乡已成为对农村进行时事宣传的一种好工具。只要是收音机到过的地方，广大农民群众就都了解到抗美援朝的一般道理。这不仅表现在他们的积极参加签名和投票上，而且表现在他们的具体行动方面。许多地方在收听以后，结合当地群众所经历过的血泪事实举行了漫谈会或控诉会。像阳高，曾先后组织了四十六人，天镇组织了三十八人进行了控诉。晋县在农村组织收听“涿县炼庄村小型控诉会”时，事先由村干部组织了十八户受敌人残害最大的苦主收听，没等到听完，十八户苦主就有二十个人泪流满面地哭诉起来，现场真人的控诉和广播控诉结合起来，对群众教育作用特别大。八宝山矿工在收听以后并且订定了爱国公约。临清什方院完小全体师生在听完广播后，立即制订了爱国公约，决心要加紧学习，扩大宣传。该县一区农民收听后，制订了四项爱国公约，各组长并在收听会上进行了签名，保证按期完成植棉任务。有的地方，农民听了广播自动发起了募捐，正像晋县顾底村一位老农说的：“提起反对美国武装日本，不用说签名投票，就是拿钱我也愿意。”陕西醴泉凹底的农民没有现钱，但是一定要捐献，纷纷把家里的鸡蛋拿了出来。天镇西河村群众，自动提出每人捐献三个鸡蛋慰问中朝人民部队和朝鲜难民。
    这次收音机下乡在进行时事宣传的同时，也直接推动了农村生产。比如在河北，各地农民就纷纷表示要多种棉花。鸡泽县八家寨张春桢说：“我本来打算种四亩棉花，自从听了无线电的报告，思想觉悟了，我要种九亩。”巨鹿西下町张怀如说：“我算是知道美国是个什么东西了，我要多种棉花表表我抗美援朝保家卫国的决心！”类似这些的例子是很多的。
    此外，收音机下乡宣传还丰富了农村群众的文化生活。
    上面这些事实说明，收音机下乡确是对广大劳动人民进行宣传教育的一种好办法。因此，各地收音员应在不妨碍组织干部收听，抄收记录广播，出版油印报及黑板报材料的情况下，或者在有两架以上收音机者的情况下，继续携带收音机下乡，以便推动抗美援朝、生产及其他各项农村工作的前进。
