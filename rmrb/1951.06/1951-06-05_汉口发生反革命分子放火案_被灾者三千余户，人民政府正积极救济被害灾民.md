　　Hankou Arson Case by Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Over 3,000 Households Affected, People's Government Actively Providing Relief to Victims

    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a major case of arson and sabotage by counter-revolutionary remnants occurred in Hankou. On May 26th, at 3:20 PM, hidden counter-revolutionary elements, taking advantage of the masses listening to reports from returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, set fire to four locations in the Hankou Chonghua District (Jiang'an Management Area): No. 18 Hancang Street, near the People's Bank office in the Zhongji Barber Shop, the Hannan Vegetable Market, and No. 11 Siguan Temple. These areas were primarily residential areas for working people, mostly consisting of shanties and board houses. Coupled with the strong winds at the time, the fire spread very rapidly. Within two hours, the fire spread to 22 streets and alleys including Daxing Street, Hancang Street, Huangpi Street, and Siguan Temple Main Street. According to preliminary statistics, over 3,300 households, totaling over 10,300 people, were affected, 2,900 houses were destroyed, and 17 people were burned to death. After the fire broke out, public security personnel and firefighters immediately rushed to the scene to rescue and extinguish the fire completely by 5:50 PM. Loss figures are currently being tallied. The Central-South Military and Political Committee and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government immediately took a series of measures after the incident to provide relief to the affected victims. People's governments and the broad masses in all localities should learn from the lesson of the Hankou special agent arson incident, overcome complacency, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and guard against all destructive conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements.
