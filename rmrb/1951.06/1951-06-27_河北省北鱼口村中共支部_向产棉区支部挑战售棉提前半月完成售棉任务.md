The CCP Branch of Beiyukou Village, Hebei Province

Challenges Cotton-Producing Area Branches to Complete Cotton Sales Task Half a Month Ahead of Schedule

　　The Chinese Communist Party branch of Beiyukou Village, Chengan County, Handan Special District, a famous cotton-producing area in Hebei Province, completed its patriotic cotton sales and storage challenge to CCP branches in cotton-producing areas across the country on June 16th, ahead of schedule. They recently challenged CCP branches in cotton-producing areas nationwide, guaranteeing to complete the cotton sales and storage tasks ahead of schedule. The branch proposed the following conditions for the competition: Party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres should play an exemplary role in the patriotic cotton sales and storage movement, first selling all their own stored cotton to the state. At the same time, they should actively promote sales to cotton farmers, ensuring that by the end of June, they will mobilize cotton farmers to sell or deposit more than 90 percent of the village's stored cotton to the state or in banks; the quality of the cotton sold should be good, without adulteration or water.

　　The CCP branch of Beiyukou Village also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing their full confidence in completing the cotton sales and storage tasks. In the letter, they recalled the impoverished lives of peasants before liberation, who lived a "half-year of chaff and vegetables, half-year of grain," and spoke of their current happy lives. The letter stated: Of the 177 peasant households in the village, 145 poor peasant households have risen to become middle peasants. In recent years, the entire village has built more than 600 new houses, bought two new carts, eight waterwheels, 159 various farm tools, and dug eight wells; the number of various livestock has increased from 52 to 103. Such a good situation "is entirely due to the leadership and help of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government." Therefore, when cotton mills across the country face difficulties due to a shortage of raw cotton, it is entirely appropriate for farmers to sell their stored cotton to the state.

　　Under the active propaganda and leadership of the village's CCP branch, cotton farmers throughout the village displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, selling or depositing all 11,077 jin of stored seed cotton to the national economic departments. Party members of the CCP branch of Beiyukou Village, during the propaganda campaign, discovered that some cotton farmers were afraid that storing cotton would be easy, but retrieving it would be troublesome. They explained to them the state's policy of cotton prices that "only listen to rises, not falls," and the way of storing cotton well so farmers would not suffer losses. For the small number of older middle peasants who had the most stored cotton but had greater ideological concerns, the village CCP branch sent the most capable party members to conduct individual propaganda, using the comparison of new and old social lives and the comparison of the People's Government's policies toward cotton farmers versus those of the past reactionary governments to conduct patriotic education. Due to the patriotic education of cotton farmers and the influence of Communist Party members taking the lead in selling cotton, the village CCP branch's plan to complete the cotton sales and storage tasks by the end of June has now been completed half a month ahead of schedule.

### 河北省北鱼口村中共支部  向产棉区支部挑战售棉提前半月完成售棉任务

　　河北省北鱼口村中共支部
    向产棉区支部挑战售棉提前半月完成售棉任务
    河北省著名产棉区邯郸专区成安县北鱼口村的中国共产党支部，已于六月十六日提前完成向全国各产棉区中共支部所提出的爱国售棉、储棉挑战竞赛计划。他们不久以前向全国各产棉区中共支部提出挑战，保证提前完成售棉、储棉任务。该支部在竞赛条件中提出：党员、青年团员、干部要在爱国主义的售棉、储棉运动中起模范作用，将自己所有的存棉首先卖给国家，同时，还要积极地向棉农宣传，保证在六月底以前，动员棉农将全村百分之九十以上的存棉卖给国家或存在银行；出售棉花的质量要好，不掺杂使水。
    北鱼口村中共支部同时还写了一封信给毛主席，表示他们对售棉、储棉任务的完成有充分信心。他们在信中回顾了解放以前农民“半年糠菜半年粮”的贫困生活，谈到了目前的美满生活。信中说：全村一百七十七户农民中的一百四十五户贫农，都已上升为中农。全村几年来新盖房屋六百多间，新买大车两辆、水车八辆，各种农具一百五十九件，打井八眼；各种牲畜由五十二头增加到一百零三头。这样好的光景“完全是在毛主席、共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下得来的。”因此，全国纱厂发生缺少原棉的困难时，农民把存棉卖给国家是完全应当的。
    全村棉农在该村中共支部积极宣传与带动下，发挥了高度的爱国主义热情，将所存籽棉一万一千零七十七斤全部卖给或存入国家经济部门。北鱼口村中共支部的党员，在宣传中曾发现部分棉农怕存棉容易、取棉麻烦，便向他们解释了国家关于棉价听涨不听落、不叫棉农吃亏的政策和好存好取的办法。对于存棉最多但思想顾虑较大的少数老中农，该村中共支部即派最得力的党员去进行个别宣传，用新旧社会生活的对比、人民政府与过去反动政府对待棉农政策对比的宣传方法，对他们进行爱国教育。由于对棉农进行了爱国主义的教育，加上共产党员带头售棉的影响，该村中共支部原订于六月底完成售棉、储棉任务的计划，现已提前半个月完成。
