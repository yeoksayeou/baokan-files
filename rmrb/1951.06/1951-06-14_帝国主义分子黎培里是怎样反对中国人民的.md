Imperialist Li Peili came to China after the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and the national liberation war was continuing. As soon as he arrived in China, he visited various dioceses under the guise of visiting, and carried out activities in various important cities. After that, in order to further strengthen imperialist aggression, he began to reorganize the national Council of Religious Affairs committees, including the National Catholic Religious Affairs Promotion Committee, the Catholic Literature Committee, and the Catholic Uniformity Promotion Committee. Li Peili's intention to reorganize these organizations was obvious. In his letter to the bishops of various dioceses on December 3, 1947, he said: "The purpose of these three Council of Religious Affairs committees is to assist and serve the hierarchy in China." The so-called "hierarchy in China" refers to the imperialist elements hidden within Catholicism; the so-called "serving the hierarchy" means serving imperialism.

Li Peili then convened the National Catholic Education Conference and the National Catholic Welfare Conference in Shanghai. The purpose of his convening these two conferences, as he said at the reception of the Shanghai Education Bureau Director Li Ximou, was to "cooperate with the government authorities to seek the greatest benefits for both the country and the church." Here, "government authorities" refers to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and "church" refers to the imperialist Li Peili and his lackeys. The so-called "greatest benefits" are obviously to assist imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government in opposing the Chinese people and the vast number of Chinese Catholics.

Let's take a look at the content of the National Catholic Education Conference convened by Li Peili.

The National Catholic Education Conference was held on February 15, 1948, at Aurora College for Women in Shanghai. In addition to the bishops of various Catholic regions and representatives of church schools, officials of the Kuomintang reactionary government such as Ying Qianli, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Puppet Ministry of Education (representing Zhu Jia Hua), Wang Zhaoquan, Counselor of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government (representing Wu Guozhen), and Li Ximou, Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, attended the meeting. Imperialist Mailer Bi, secretary of the former US Embassy in China, also came to supervise. Li Peili praised this shameless collusion as "the spirit of political-religious cooperation." Li Peili explained at the meeting that the purpose of this meeting was to "oppose communism" and "hate class struggle." Mailer Bi said even more bluntly at the meeting: "The current priority is how to defeat communism... not only politically and militarily, but also culturally and educationally." This is the true content of the "spirit of political-religious unity" that the imperialist Li Peili said.

After holding the above two meetings, Li Peili, accompanied by his private secretary Chen Zhemin, attended the pseudo-National Assembly and Chiang Kai-shek's bribery election of the pseudo-president in April and May of the same year. On the day Chiang Kai-shek took office as the pseudo-president, Li rushed from Shanghai to Nanjing to participate in the congratulations. From the news recorded in the newspapers at the time and the published photos, we can see how joyfully Li Peili congratulated the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek on taking office as the pseudo-president, in order to continue the so-called "political-religious unity" of bloody collusion. After the liberation of mainland China, Li Peili was not reconciled to the revolutionary victory of the Chinese people. He continued to instruct and use the Catholic Religious Affairs Promotion Committee to intensify his opposition to the Chinese people and the People's Government. Especially after the people of the whole country launched the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea last year, and patriotic Catholics initiated the Three-Self Reform Movement, Li Peili successively issued "encyclicals" to various dioceses to sabotage this patriotic movement of Catholics. The letter to the bishops of the whole country that has been published is only one of them, and we can find many other evidences, such as the fallacy entitled "What Shall We Do" published in the "Missionary Learning Reference Materials" secretly issued by the Catholic Religious Affairs Promotion Committee at the beginning of this year. He slandered the great liberation of the Chinese people with joy and excitement as a "serious spiritual crisis." He showed extreme hostility to the victory of the Chinese people and the patriotic movement that the Chinese people are carrying out in this fallacy. He called on imperialist elements and their lackeys to swear to be enemies with the patriotic movement of the Chinese people with the attitude of so-called "rather endure imprisonment and face death calmly."

The facts cited above prove that Li Peili is a running dog of the US imperialists, a gang of foxes and dogs of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and a deadly enemy of the Chinese people! We patriotic Catholics firmly stand together with the people of the whole country, and demand that the government immediately deport the imperialist Li Peili, thoroughly investigate and deal with Li Peili's criminal tool and conspiracy center, the "Catholic Religious Affairs Promotion Committee"!

　　帝国主义分子黎培里是怎样反对中国人民的
    震旦大学教务长　杨士达
    帝国主义分子黎培里是在中国人民击败了日本帝国主义以后，全国的解放战争正在继续进行之际来到中国的。他一到中国，即以访问各教区为名，到各重要城市去进行活动。之后，他为了进一步加强帝国主义的侵略活动，着手改组了全国性教务会议委员会的组织，包括天主教教务协进委员会、天主教文献委员会及天主教划一促进委员会三个机构。黎培里改组这些机构的用意是昭然若揭的，他在一九四七年十二月三日给各教区主教的信中说：“这三个教务会议委员会的目的是为了给在中国的圣统以协助和服务”。所谓“在中国的圣统”就是隐匿在天主教内的帝国主义分子们；所谓“替圣统”服务，就是替帝国主义服务。
    黎培里接着又在上海召开了全国公教教育会议和全国天主教福利会议。他召开这两个会议的目的，正如他在匪上海市教育局局长李熙谋招待会上所说，是为了所谓“教会与政府当局从事合作，以谋国家及教会双方最大的利益。”这里“政府当局”就是蒋匪帮，“教会”就是指的帝国主义分子黎培里及其走狗，所谓“最大利益”，显然是协助帝国主义及蒋匪政府反对中国人民，反对中国的广大天主教徒。
    且看一看黎培里召开的全国公教教育会议的内容吧。
    全国公教教育会议是一九四八年二月十五日在上海震旦女子文理学院举行的。出席这个会议的除天主教各区主教及教会学校代表外，还有国民党反动政府官员如伪教育部社教司司长英千里（代表朱匪家骅）、伪上海市政府参事王兆荃（代表吴匪国桢）、伪上海市教育局局长李匪熙谋。前美国驻华大使馆的秘书帝国主义分子麦尔毕也亲临监督。这种无耻勾结，黎培里赞之为“政教合作之精神”。黎培里在会上说明了这个会议的目的，是为了“反对共产主义”和“憎恨阶级斗争”。麦尔毕在会上更露骨地说：“当前的要务是如何打倒共产主义，……不但在政治上、军事上，而且也要在文化及教育上去努力打倒共产主义。”这就是帝国主义者黎培里所说的“政教合一精神”的真实内容。
    在开过了上述两个会以后，黎培里在同年四、五月间偕同他的私人秘书陈哲敏出席了伪国民代表大会及蒋匪介石贿选伪总统的选举会。在蒋匪就任伪总统那天，黎又匆匆从上海赶到南京去参加祝贺。从当时报上记载的消息及刊出的照片，我们可以看出黎培里是怎样欢欣鼓舞地恭贺战犯蒋匪就任伪总统，来继续所谓“政教合一”的血腥勾结。中国大陆解放后，黎培里并不甘心中国人民的革命胜利，他继续指使和利用天主教教务协进委员会，加紧反对中国人民及人民政府。特别是在去年全国人民展开抗美援朝运动，天主教内的爱国教徒发起了三自革新运动之后，黎培里即连续向各教区发出“通谕”，破坏天主教徒的这一爱国运动。业已发表的致全国主教的信不过是其中的一件而已，我们还可以找出其他许多罪证，例如他在今年年初，在天主教教务协进委员会秘密发行的“传教士学习参考资料”上发表一篇题为“我们怎么办”的谬文，把中国人民欢欣鼓舞的伟大解放诬蔑为“严重的灵性危机”，对于中国人民的胜利和中国人民正在进行的爱国主义的运动，他在这篇谬文中表现了极端仇视的态度。他号召帝国主义分子和其走狗，以所谓“宁愿忍受系狱和从容就义”的态度，誓死与中国人民的爱国运动为敌。
    以上所举的事实，证明黎培里是美帝国主义者的走狗，蒋匪帮的狐群狗党，中国人民的死敌！我们爱国的天主教徒，坚决和全国人民站在一起，要求政府立刻把帝国主义分子黎培里驱逐出境，对黎培里的罪恶工具和阴谋中心“天主教教务协进委员会”加以彻查和究办！
