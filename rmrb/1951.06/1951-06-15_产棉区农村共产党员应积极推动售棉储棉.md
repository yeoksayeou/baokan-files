Communist Party Members in Cotton-Producing Areas Should Actively Promote Cotton Sales and Storage

The Communist Party Branch of Dongjiacun Village in Shahe Actively Launched a Cotton Sales and Storage Campaign
The Communist Party branch of Dongjiacun Village in Shahe County, Hebei Province, upon seeing the CCP Central Committee's instructions on ensuring the completion of cotton purchase and storage tasks on June 4, held a joint meeting with village cadres and labor models that evening to discuss launching a cotton sales and storage campaign in the village. After discussion, everyone agreed that it was necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education among the masses, explaining that selling and storing cotton was currently the most practical and meaningful patriotic action of cotton farmers in resisting America and aiding Korea. Subsequently, branch committee members led everyone in analyzing and studying the current cotton storage situation in the village and stipulated different methods for mobilizing different targets. At the meeting, Communist Party member cadres and labor models all expressed their intention to lead the village in launching a cotton sales and storage campaign with their own practical actions.

Cotton Planting Model Xue Jixian said: "When the cotton seedlings had not yet emerged this year, the government lent us fertilizer; when we had no food to eat, the government lent us grain. Now that the country needs cotton, we must not store the cotton and let the factories stop working." Xue Jixian also calculated the cotton he planted this year and pre-sold 2,000 jin to the cooperative. Women's labor model Wang Sanni also stored her remaining 20 jin of cotton in the cooperative. Zhang Qing, the director of the farmers' association, also stored the only 5 jin of cotton in his home in the cooperative and wanted to mobilize his relatives to store all their cotton in government-designated agencies. All the Communist Party members, cadres, and labor models in the village carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization and promoted this work with practical actions. As a result, the village launched a cotton sales and storage campaign. On June 5 alone, in half a day, cotton farmers in the village stored 2,000 jin of cotton for the country and pre-ordered a contract to sell 13,000 jin of cotton to the country with the village cooperative.

Party Member Yang Mingtang Takes the Lead in Selling Cotton to the Country
Yangjia Zaohang in Boxing Completes Cotton Storage Task

Communist Party member Yang Mingtang is from Yangjia Zaohang Village in Boxing County, Shandong. In this patriotic cotton sales and storage campaign, he not only set an example by selling cotton to the country himself but also actively mobilized other farmers to respond to the government's call for cotton sales and storage. Yang Mingtang understood the significance of this work. He also understood that it was not easy to mobilize everyone to sell and store cotton because many people still had many backward ideas. Therefore, it was necessary to promote the benefits of selling and storing cotton to the country and oneself in a thorough and extensive manner. When the village's Communist Party branch secretary Yang Fengfu and village head Yang Mingdao convened a mass meeting to mobilize people, he explained the importance of selling and storing cotton at the meeting. However, no one signed up to store cotton after the mobilization at the meeting. At this time, some village cadres were dejected and lost confidence. However, Yang Mingtang was not discouraged. He knew that this was because the publicity work was not enough, so he went to the home of farmer Yang Pinghe to carry out individual persuasion and mobilization. Yang Pinghe harvested a total of 1,850 jin of cotton last year. Yang Mingtang understood that Yang Pinghe was mainly afraid that storing cotton in state organs was not as convenient as storing it at home. For example, Yang Pinghe said: "I plan to exchange cotton for wheat after the wheat harvest." At this time, Yang Mingtang explained to him: "If you store cotton in state organs, you can get grain if you want grain, and you can get money if you want money." Yang Pinghe was very happy to hear this and stored all the remaining 1,000 jin of cotton; he also guaranteed to mobilize his brother Yang Anhe to do the same. After Yang Mingtang and Yang Pinghe's publicity, everyone stored cotton for the country. Yangjia Zaohang smoothly completed the task of storing 4,600 jin of cotton.

　　产棉区农村共产党员应积极推动售棉储棉
    沙河东九家村共产党员带头展开售棉储棉运动
    河北省沙河县东九家村的共产党支部，六月四日见到中共中央关于保证完成购棉储棉任务的指示后，当晚就和村干部、劳动模范举行联席会议，讨论在本村开展售棉储棉运动。讨论了以后，大家认为：应该深入群众进行宣传教育工作，说明售棉储棉正是目前棉农最实际最有意义的抗美援朝爱国行动。接着支部委员领导大家分析研究了目前全村的存棉情况，规定了向各种不同的对象进行动员的不同办法。在会上，共产党员干部、劳动模范都表示要以自己的实际行动，带动全村展开售棉储棉运动。
    植棉模范薛计贤说：“今年棉苗未出土的时候，政府就贷卖给咱肥料；咱们没有粮食吃，政府又借给粮食。现在国家需要棉花，咱们决不能存放着棉花让工厂停工。”薛计贤还把今年种的棉花计算了一下，预售给合作社二千斤。妇女劳动模范王三妮把留着的二十斤棉花也存入了合作社。农会主任张庆把家里仅存的五斤棉花也存入了合作社；并要动员自己的亲戚，把所有存棉存入政府指定的机关。全村共产党员、干部、劳动模范深入地进行了宣传动员，并且以实际行动推动这一工作。全村因此展开了售棉储棉运动。仅六月五日半天中，全村就有棉农向国家存放棉花二千斤，并和村合作社预订了卖给国家棉花一万三千斤的合同。
            党员杨明堂带头卖棉给国家
            博兴杨家枣行完成储棉任务
    共产党员杨明堂是山东博兴县杨家枣行村人，在这次开展爱国售棉储棉运动中，不仅自己以身作则将棉花卖给国家，而且积极地动员其他农民，响应政府售棉储棉号召。杨明堂一面了解这一工作的意义，另一面又了解发动大家售棉储棉是不容易的，因为许多人还有许多落后的思想，因此必须深入地、广泛地向大家宣传售棉储棉对国家和自己的好处。当他村里的共产党支部书记杨风富、村长杨明道召开群众大会作动员时，他就在大会上说明售棉储棉的重要。但是，会上动员后仍无人报名储棉。这时有些村干就垂头丧气，失去信心。可是杨明堂并不灰心，他知道这是宣传工作还不够的原故，就深入农民杨平和家去进行个别说服动员。杨平和去年共收了一千八百五十斤棉花。杨明堂了解了杨平和主要是怕把棉花存在国家机关不如存在家里方便。如杨平和说：“我准备麦子下来后，拿棉花换麦子。”这时杨明堂就给他说明：“把棉花存在国家机关你要粮食有粮食，要钱有钱。”杨平和听了就很高兴地将剩余的一千斤棉花全部存储出去；还保证去动员他兄弟杨安和也照样办。经过杨明堂与杨平和的宣传，大家纷纷把棉花存给国家。杨家枣行很顺利地就完成了四千六百斤的存棉任务。
