            The "Profession" of the US Military
    The Bayreuth Municipal Council in the American-occupied zone of West Germany announced that, according to the order of the US military command, the construction of explosive chambers has begun on the bridges of Bayreuth's streets.

            Tito's Crimes Against Children
    More than one million Yugoslav children who lost their parents during the Hitler occupation, as well as children whose parents were thrown into prisons and concentration camps by Tito's followers, now live in terrible conditions.

Tito's followers are also forcing children aged ten to fifteen to work for them. Tito's gang's crimes against children fully demonstrate that they are not only enemies of the Yugoslav people, but also enemies of mankind.
