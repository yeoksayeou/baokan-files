Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch:

Under the command of American fascist groups, reactionary fascist groups are being greatly fostered in Japan by American imperialism. Under the direction of American fascist groups, Japanese militaristic groups will establish joint organizations, attempting to revive the conspiracies of Japanese militarism in Asia. Erle Cocke, commander of the American Legion, a veterans' fascist group in America, visited certain countries in the Far East and Europe in March of this year. According to well-informed sources in the U.S. Congress, this activity was carried out under the instructions of the "National Association of Manufacturers" of the United States and the personal suggestion of Truman (who is also a member of the "American Legion"), attempting to strengthen the activities of anti-democratic groups and parties in countries such as Japan, Yugoslavia, Italy, West Germany, and the United Kingdom, so as to exert a more effective influence on the direction of their activities in the future. Cocke's visits to Japan and Taiwan were the first step in realizing this goal. Cocke has reported the results of his trip to Truman after returning to the United States.

During his stay in Japan, Cocke successively met with the leading figures of various major militaristic organizations, with the aim of establishing regular contact between the "American Legion" and these groups, and forming Japanese fascist groups into a united organization in accordance with the model of the "American Legion."

As a result of Cocke's activities in Japan, a plan for a united organization to uniformly lead all Japanese militaristic groups has been drafted, tentatively named the "Japanese Black Flag League." Cocke proposed that the main tasks of the "League" are: to prepare to restore the "Japanese Empire" on the Asian continent and suppress domestic progressive organizations.

The "League" includes the following major Japanese militaristic organizations: "Black Dragon Society," the "Japanese Revolutionary Chrysanthemum Flag Comrades Association" spread throughout the country, "Yamato Public Corporation," Takashi Mikami's "Sincerity Society," "East Asia League," and "Yuhi Society," etc.

The "League" will be led by former General Kazushige Ugaki (now the head of the fascist underground organization "K.A.T.O. Agency"), a war criminal; leaders will also include: former Vice Chief of the Army General Staff, former General Jinzaburo Masaki, former Major General Takayoshi Tanaka, and former Lieutenant General Seizo Arisue, Masaharu Kageyama and Takao Hasegawa of "Yamato Public Corporation," Seishi Fukushima, the head of the "Chrysanthemum Flag Comrades Association," fascist element Takashi Mikami, and war criminal Ichiro Hatoyama who will be purged, Takeo Ohashi, the current president of the Ministry of Justice, Goro Morishima, a member of the Diet, and Akira Sono, a bureaucrat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

According to Cocke, the initial operating funds of the "League" will be provided by the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo and Japanese government agencies. The "American Legion" and American manufacturers will also spend huge sums of money as funding. As for the future recurring expenses of the "League," they will be paid periodically by Japanese monopoly capitalists.

According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch on May 22, the number of right-wing anti-communist groups that have been officially registered with the Special Review Bureau of the Ministry of Justice of the reactionary Yoshida government has reached approximately 600 units so far. The Special Review Bureau has also made the following classification of the main groups among them: The first type is: "Groups of rearmament advocates." For example, the "National Defense Democratic League" organized by militarist Yuzuru Tsurumi and others, who were purged last October, is advocating rearmament and lifting of purges, and is carrying out nationwide propaganda activities. The second type is: anti-communist groups composed of former right-wing elements, all composed of former members of the "Black Dragon Society," "Sakura Society," and "Ko-Sakura Society." The third type is: a group recruiting soldiers in Japan for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. It is centered on former Lieutenant General Hiroshi Nemoto, and former Lieutenant General Tokutaro Sakurai is also involved. The fourth type is: "Pan-Asianism" groups, including the "East Asia League" led by the late former Lieutenant General Kanji Ishihara and the recently established "New National Movement League." In addition, Nobuchika Tsu Kane, a war criminal who invaded China, is also known as an "Asianist." These Japanese war criminal fascist forces have openly and brazenly become "active," which is obviously the result of Cocke's conspiratorial arrangements.

　　美国法西斯团体指挥下
    日本的军国主义团体阴谋在亚洲恢复活动
    【新华社三日讯】美帝国主义正在日本大事扶植反动的法西斯团体。在美国法西斯团体的指挥下，日本军国主义团体将建立联合组织，妄图恢复日本军国主义在亚洲的阴谋活动。今年三月间，美国退伍军人法西斯团体“美国军团”司令寇克（Erle Cocke）对远东及欧洲某些国家的访问，据美国国会消息灵通人士透露：系受美国“全国制造商协会”的指示与杜鲁门（杜本人也是“美国军团”分子）个人的提议而进行活动的，企图加强日本、南斯拉夫、意大利、西德和英国等国的反民主团体与党派的活动，以便今后对他们的活动方向予以更有效的影响。而寇克之访问日本与台湾，就是实现这一目的的第一步。寇克返国后已向杜鲁门报告了此行的结果。
    寇克在日本停留期间，曾先后会见各主要军国主义组织的领导人物，其目的在建立“美国军团”和这些团体之间的经常联系，并按照“美国军团”的形式将日本法西斯团体结成一个联合组织。
    寇克在日本活动的结果，已拟就了统一领导全日本军国主义团体联合组织的计划，暂名“日本黑旗联盟”。寇克提出了该“联盟”的主要任务是：准备在亚洲大陆恢复“日本帝国”及镇压国内进步组织。
    该“联盟”包括下列日本主要军国主义组织，即：“黑龙会”、遍及全国各地的“日本革命菊旗同志会”、“大和公社”、三上卓的“赤诚会”、“东亚联盟”及“雄飞会”等。
    该“联盟”将以战犯宇垣一成前大将（现为法西斯地下组织“Ｋ·Ａ·Ｔ·Ｏ·机关”的头子）为首领；领导人中并包括：前陆军参谋次长真崎甚三郎前大将、田中隆吉前少将及有末精三前中将，“大和公社”头子影山正治和长谷川高雄，“菊旗同志会”的头子福岛青史，法西斯分子三上卓，和将被解除整肃的战犯鸠山一郎、现任法务府总裁大桥武夫、国会议员森岛五郎，外务省官僚曾野明等。
    据寇克称，该“联盟”的初期活动经费将由驻东京美军总部及日本政府机关供给。“美国军团”及美国制造商亦将支出巨额款项充作经费。至于该“联盟”将来的经常费用，则由日本独占资本家按期支付。
    另据五月二十二日共同社东京电称，已向吉田反动政府法务府特别审查局正式登记备案的右翼反共团体截至现在止，已约有六百单位之多。特别审查局并对其中的主要团体，作了如下的分类：第一种是：“再武装论者的集团”。如去年十月被解除整肃的军国主义分子鹤见祐辅等所组织的“国土防御民主主义同盟”，正提倡再武装及解除整肃，并在进行全国性的宣传活动。第二种是：由旧时右翼分子组成的反共团体，均为原属“黑龙会”、“樱会”和“小樱会”分子所组成。第三种是：为蒋匪在日本招兵的集团。以根本博前中将为中心，樱井德太郎前中将亦在内。第四种是：“大亚细亚主义”集团，已故石原莞尔前中将领导的“东亚联盟”及最近成立的“新生国民运动同盟”，都属这一集团。此外侵华战犯迁政信，亦被称为“亚细亚主义者”。这些日寇战犯法西斯势力，公然明目张胆地“活跃”起来，显然是寇克阴谋布置的结果。
