　　Facing the Bankruptcy of Asian Aggression
    US Frantically Expands Bases in the Philippines
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The United States is now pressuring the Philippine government to accelerate plans to consolidate and expand US military bases in the Philippines. The spearhead of this aggressive plan is clearly aimed at China and the entire Asian region.
    Reuters, London, April 25th: According to reports from British newspaper correspondents in Hong Kong, US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, recently stated that the US government has decided that the condition for US "aid" to the Philippines is that the Philippine government guarantees that the "aid" funds will be "used to promote US military operations in the Far East and throughout Asia." Cowen urged the Philippine government to immediately begin implementing previously agreed plans for the United States to establish new air force bases and other strategic facilities in the Philippines, and to increase the number of US troops stationed in the Philippines when necessary. Cowen also suggested that a considerable portion of the funds necessary to implement this plan should be raised domestically in the Philippines.
    As is well known, the US plan to operate military bases in the Philippines was prepared when the Chinese People's Liberation War was victoriously progressing on the mainland, and was implemented around the time the US launched its war of aggression against Korea. Since 1947, in preparation for greatly expanding its original bases in the Philippines, the United States has purchased large amounts of land near Clark, Sangley Point in Manila Bay, and Subic Bay. After the founding of the Central People's Government of China in 1949, US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, immediately began negotiations with Quirino at the end of November regarding expanding old bases and building new bases in the Philippines. After the establishment of the "Base Expansion Agreement" between the US and the Philippines on June 17, 1950, the United States began expanding Sangley Point into a "first-class naval and army base." After the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, it expanded an area of 40,000 square meters near the base into a landing base for jet aircraft and seaplanes. On November 17, US Secretary of the Navy Matthews negotiated with the Philippine government to further expand the naval base facilities there, and also to build eleven naval bases in places such as Lamon Bay. On December 14, after the US invading forces suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, the US House of Representatives proposed a plan to allocate funds to expand naval base facilities in the Philippines. According to a report by United Press on February 1 this year, the US House of Representatives immediately approved the US Navy's $35 million expansion plan for bases in the Philippines and Guam.
    The number of bases of all sizes that the United States now possesses in the Philippines, according to the 1947 "US-Philippines Military Assistance Agreement," is twenty-three, which the Philippines leased to US imperialism for a period of ninety-nine years. However, according to public reports from various sources, the number of bases and airports of various sizes that can actually be identified with definite locations has reached thirty-five. This fully exposes how frantically the United States is carrying out its criminal plans to invade China and invade Asia.

### 面临亚洲侵略的破产  美在菲疯狂扩充基地

　　面临亚洲侵略的破产
    美在菲疯狂扩充基地
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国现正压迫菲律宾政府加紧进行巩固和扩充美国在菲律宾军事基地的计划。这个侵略计划的矛头是明显地指向中国和整个亚洲地区的。
    电通社伦敦四月二十五日讯，根据英国报纸驻香港记者报道，不久以前美驻菲大使柯温曾经表示，美国政府业已决定，给予菲律宾美“援”的条件是要菲律宾政府保证将此项“援助”资金“用来促进美国在远东和整个亚洲的军事行动”。柯温敦促菲律宾政府立即开始执行以前获得协议的计划，即美国在菲律宾建立新的空军基地和其他战略设备，以及在必要时增加美国驻菲军队。柯温并建议为实现这个计划所必需的相当大的一部分资金应在菲律宾国内筹措。
    如所周知，美国在菲律宾经营军事基地的计划是当中国人民解放战争在大陆胜利进行时着手准备、而在美国发动侵朝战争前后就已付诸实施的。一九四七年以来，美国为准备大事扩充在菲律宾原有的基地，在克拉克和马尼拉湾的三格里和苏必克湾附近购置了大量的土地。一九四九年我国中央人民政府成立之后，美驻菲大使柯温立即于十一月底与季里诺展开关于在菲扩充旧基地、建筑新基地的谈判。一九五○年六月十七日美菲成立“扩充基地协定”后，美国即着手将三格里扩充为“第一等的海陆军基地”，美国发动侵朝战争后，又把该基地附近四万方公尺地区扩大为喷气式机和海上飞机着陆基地。十一月十七日美海军部长马休斯与菲政府谈判将该处海军基地设备再加扩充，同时并修建拉蒙湾等地的十一个海军基地。十二月十四日，即当美侵略军在朝鲜遭受惨败后，美众院又提出了拨款扩充在菲若干海军基地设备的计划。据今年二月一日合众社报道，美众院随即认可了美海军在菲律宾及关岛基地三千五百万美元的扩充计划。
    现在美国在菲律宾拥有大小基地的数目，据一九四七年“美菲军事援助协定”规定，菲律宾以九十九年为期租给美帝国主义的基地是二十三个，但据各方公开报道统计，实际上能举出确实地点的大小基地和飞机场数目已达三十五个。这就充分暴露了美国是怎样疯狂地进行着侵略中国、侵略亚洲的罪恶计划。
