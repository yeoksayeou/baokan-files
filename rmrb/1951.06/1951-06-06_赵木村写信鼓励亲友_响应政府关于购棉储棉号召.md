Zhao Mucun Writes a Letter Encouraging Relatives and Friends
Responding to the Government's Call to Purchase and Store Cotton

To the Editor:

My hometown is in a cotton-producing area of Hebei Province. When I saw the State Council's directive on purchasing and storing cotton and the People's Daily editorial on June 1st, I wrote several letters overnight and sent them to relatives and friends in the cotton-producing areas and to my former landlords (we engaged in guerrilla warfare during the War of Resistance Against Japan and often stayed in farmers' homes, and we still correspond regularly) to persuade them to respond to the government's call. One letter was written to my mother, and I am now copying it for you. I think this will have a certain propaganda and promotional effect on the country's work of purchasing and storing cotton. The following is the letter I wrote to my mother:

"Mom:

Don't you often say that you have never had such a good life as today in your sixty or seventy years? Indeed, we have turned over and become masters of our own destiny, divided the fields and houses, and are able to eat and dress warmly because we have the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. 'We will always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!' This is also what you often talk about with neighbors. Mom, now there is something we need to do according to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's words: The People's Daily published the Central People's Government State Council's directive on cotton purchase and storage work on June 1st, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels to ensure the victorious completion of this task. This shows how much our Party and government value this work. I hope Mom will play her own exemplary role and lead relatives and friends to respond to the call of the Party and the government.

Mom, I think you will realize that we have a source of cotton. Before the land reform, our area was also the central cotton-producing area on the great plains of Hebei Province. Why did our family never store cotton before? Isn't it because after the land reform, we were given land, and the government used various methods to reward cotton planting and protect the interests of cotton farmers, such as pre-purchasing cotton from cotton farmers, providing fertilizers on credit to cotton farmers, stipulating reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, and stipulating that the public grain for cotton land should not be higher than that for ordinary crops. This is how we were able to gain great benefits from growing cotton. But now many cotton farmers are keeping cotton at home and are unwilling to sell it to the state, which will cause many of our textile factories to be unable to produce properly because they do not have cotton. If factories cannot weave cloth, it will affect the clothing of the people across the country. At the same time, American imperialism has adopted a blockade policy targeting the shortage of raw cotton in our country, attempting to trap us. Mom, I know that our family still has some cotton stored. In order to love our country, I think you will not hesitate to store all the stored cotton in the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company. In this way, we will help the country solve the difficulty of insufficient raw cotton, and the country will save the physical objects for us; this is precisely the patriotic action that our cotton planting farmers should take. I hope Mom will publicize and drive the cotton farmers in this village and township to be able to do so."

　　赵木村写信鼓励亲友
    响应政府关于购棉储棉号召编辑同志：
    我的家乡在河北省产棉区。当我在六月一日看到政务院关于购棉储棉的指示及人民日报社论后，就连夜赶写了几封信，分别寄给产棉区的亲友及过去的旧房东（在抗日战争时我们打游击，时常在农民家里住，现在还经常通信）劝告他们响应政府的号召。有一封信是写给我妈妈的，现抄一份给你们，我想，这对国家的购棉储棉工作是有一定的宣传推动作用的。以下是我写给妈妈的信：“妈妈：
    你不是常说，你活了六、七十岁从来没有过今天这样的好日子吗？的确，我们因为有了毛主席共产党的领导，才翻了身，分了田地和房子，才能吃饱穿暖了。‘我们永远跟着毛主席共产党走！’这也是你常和街坊邻人谈的话。妈妈，现在有一件事要我们依照毛主席共产党的话来作：六月一日人民日报刊登了中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示，中国共产党中央指示各级党委保证这件任务的胜利完成。这说明我们的党和政府是如何地重视这一工作。我希望妈妈发挥自己的模范作用，带动亲戚邻友来响应党和政的号召。
    妈妈，我想你会想到咱有棉花的来源。土地改革前，咱那里也是河北省大平原上的中心产棉区，为什么咱家从来没有存过棉花呢？这还不是经过土地改革咱分到了田地，政府又用各种办法奖励植棉，保护棉农利益，如向棉农预购棉花，赊给棉农肥料，规定合理的棉粮比价，规定种棉花地的公粮不得高于普通庄稼地的公粮。这样才使咱们种了棉花得了很大的利益。但是现在有很多棉农将棉花放在家里，不肯卖给国家，这就会使咱们很多纺织工厂因为没有棉花，不能好好生产。工厂织不出布来，更会影响到全国人民的穿衣问题。同时，美帝国主义针对我国原棉不足的情况，采取了封锁政策，企图困住我们。妈妈，我知道咱们家现在还存有一些棉花。为了爱护咱们的国家，我想你一定会毫不犹豫地把所有存棉储存到国营花纱布公司里去。这样我们帮助国家解决了原棉不足的困难，国家又替我们保存了实物；这正是我们植棉农民所应有的爱国行动。希望妈妈宣传和带动本村本乡的棉农，都能够这样作。”
