Farmers in Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province—the hometown of Liu Hulan—are enthusiastically responding to the call from the Provincial Women's Federation and the Provincial Youth Federation to donate a "Liu Hulan" aircraft squadron, and are actively formulating plans to increase production and make donations. The villagers have been engaging in lively discussions at various meetings, both large and small. Wang Zhongyuan, a 62-year-old female propagandist, said, "If it weren't for the Volunteer Army shedding blood and sacrificing themselves in Korea, how could we maintain our good lives? The more we donate, the more we increase the power to defend our country and protect our homes." Everyone agreed, "The more sweat we shed, the less blood the Volunteer Army will have to shed." Farmer Shi Taishan suggested, "Food comes from the hoe; if everyone hoes the land one more time, we can hoe out airplanes and cannons." After discussion, the farmers in the village convened family meetings to formulate plans to increase production and make donations. Hu Wenxiu, Liu Hulan's mother, reported on the family's six-month donation plan at the village women's meeting: 1. The entire family will immediately donate 10,000 yuan; 2. Liu Hulan's grandfather and father will donate 10 jin of wheat, 3 jin of cotton, and 20 jin of refined grains from increased production income; 3. Liu Hulan's younger brother will work one extra day each month and donate all his wages. Chen Yulan, a member of the Communist Youth League, and her three siblings-in-law also made plans to boil more native salt, increase cotton production, and collect wheat to donate. All the village militiamen decided to work one extra day each month and donate their wages. In total, the village's 200 households will donate 10,000 jin of rice through increased production alone. The village has established a donation committee to lead the farmers in realizing their plans to increase production and make donations.

　　刘胡兰故乡农民纷纷订出增产捐献计划
    刘胡兰的故乡——山西省文水县云周西村的农民，热烈响应省妇女联合会、省青年联合会关于捐献“刘胡兰”飞机小队的号召，纷纷订出增产捐献计划。在该村各种大小型会议上，农民们热烈地展开了讨论。六十二岁的女宣传员王中元说：“要不是志愿军在朝鲜流血牺牲，怎么能保住咱们的好光景？多捐一点，就多增加一分保国卫家的力量。”大家都认为：“咱们多流些汗，志愿军就可以少流些血。”农民石泰山提出：“锄头上就有粮食，大家多锄一遍地，便能把飞机大炮锄出来。”经过讨论后，全村农民即纷纷召开家庭会议，订出增产捐献计划。刘胡兰母亲胡文秀在该村妇女会上报告了全家半年捐献计划：一、全家立即捐献一万元；二、刘胡兰的祖父和父亲从增加生产的收入中捐小麦十斤、棉花三斤、细粮二十斤；三、刘胡兰弟弟每月多作一天工，将工资全部捐献。青年团员陈玉兰与兄嫂三人也订出多熬土盐、增产棉花及拾麦子捐献计划。全村民兵都决定每人每月多作一天工，捐出工资。总计全村二百户仅增加生产捐献的，即达一万斤米。该村已成立捐献委员会，负责领导农民们实现增产捐献的计划。
