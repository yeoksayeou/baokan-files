　　Wheat Seed Selection Campaign Widely Launched
　　Excellent Variety Discovered in Shangqiu, Henan
    The wheat seed selection campaign has been widely launched across the country. In provinces such as Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi, mass seed selection competitions have become a popular trend. In general areas, the masses are being mobilized for seed selection with a focus. In the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi alone, 141 counties have launched seed selection work. In Shandong Province, 5% to 20% of the areas have conducted field "ear selection," and 50% to 70% of the areas have conducted "plot selection." In Hebei Province, Qingyuan County alone plans to select 140,000 jin of seeds, preparing to plant entirely improved wheat varieties throughout the county this autumn. Xuan City in southern Anhui plans to select 130,000 jin of seeds, and has now reached 230,000 jin. On the basis of preliminary seed selection, major wheat-producing areas are further comparing and evaluating superior wheat varieties at the county level. At the national level, 120 counties can complete this further evaluation work this year.

    During the seed selection campaign, some areas have discovered outstanding superior varieties. For example, a "Huoliao Wheat" variety was discovered in Shangqiu Shangxin District, Henan, with a yield twice as high as ordinary wheat. It also has strong resistance to pests and diseases.

　　小麦选种运动普遍展开
　  河南商邱发现优良品种
    全国各地小麦选种运动已普遍开展。河南、山东、陕西等省，群众性的选种竞赛已形成热潮。一般地区，正在有重点地发动群众选种。仅湖南、湖北广东、广西四省，即有一百四十一县展开了选种工作。山东省有百分之五到二十的地区进行了田间“穗选”，百分之五十到七十的地区进行了“片选”。河北省仅清苑一县即计划选种十四万斤，准备今秋在全县范围内完全种上良种小麦。皖南宣城计划选种十三万斤，现已达到二十三万斤。在初步选种的基础上，各产麦区正以县为单位进一步进行比较，评选优良麦种。在全国范围内，有一百二十个县今年可以完成这种进一步的评选工作。
    在选种运动中，有的地区已发现了突出的优良品种。如河南商邱商新区发现一种“火燎麦”，产量高出普通小麦一倍。抵抗病虫害力也强。（王志民）
