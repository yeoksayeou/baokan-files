An Zhiwen's Reading Group
    By our reporter Fu Dong

    An Zhiwen's reading group in Taiyanggong, District 7 of Beijing, has explored important experiences in organizing regular Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda through reading groups in terms of organizational form, reading content and methods.

    When An Zhiwen's reading group was first established in May of last year, the organization was large. More than a dozen members were sock knitters and vendors from the Taiyanggong area. Everyone did not live in the same courtyard, and their work was very busy. However, the reading group had a rigid rule: "Read the newspaper at eight o'clock every day, and don't read until everyone is there." As a result, often this person came and that person left, and the whole night passed in vain. Everyone felt that reading the newspaper had become a burden. So a review meeting was held. It was decided that the central group would be composed of the three An brothers and An Yuwen's wife, with An Zhiwen publicly elected as the leader. If there was important news or a problem that needed to be discussed, a note would be written to notify other people to participate. In this way, with key members and the combination of the masses, it was guaranteed that the newspaper could be read every day. An Zhiwen, the group leader, had a higher level of understanding of the issues than other members. If he didn't understand something, he would write to the People's Daily to ask. At the same time, the reading time was not fixed so rigidly, but based on the principle of not affecting production. After this change, more people came to listen to the newspaper reading. Almost every day after dinner, workers from several nearby sock knitting factories would come to listen to the newspaper reading.

    The content and methods of reading the newspaper have also been improved. When An Zhiwen was first elected as the leader of the reading group by everyone, he was very active. When he came back from outside every day, sometimes he didn't even bother to eat, and he was busy reading the newspaper to everyone. He read mostly long articles, and he had to read until eleven or twelve o'clock at night, sometimes even until two or three o'clock in the morning, which made everyone very tired and had no energy to work the next day. One day, An Zhiwen found that he was reading the newspaper hard, but the group members were not paying attention. Some group members sneaked away without knowing when. Of the three remaining group members, two were chatting idly, and one was looking down at a novel. This situation made him feel distressed.

    After discovering this problem, everyone held another review meeting. It was decided that after the newspaper arrived, the central group would carefully read it first. Before reading to everyone or holding a discussion meeting, the people in the group would first exchange ideas about the masses' thoughts, understand the issues that the masses urgently needed to know, and then combine the central issues of current affairs and the current central work to select news to read. The group leader would prepare before reading, dissolving many related news items together, and when reading, use popular language to explain the main meaning of the news like telling a story.

    In the early days of the American invasion of Korea, some people scolded: "The United States is really not a good thing!" Others could not understand the thinking. Two old men said: "How can you say that the United States is bad? The United States gave us relief flour!"

    In response to this ideological situation, An Zhiwen and others linked up the specific facts reported in the newspaper about American planes constantly invading my Northeast territory for reconnaissance, bombing, strafing, the American occupation of my Taiwan, the American warships shelling Shandong and illegally inspecting our merchant ships, and the American continuous supply of Chiang Kai-shek's planes and tanks, and told them to everyone. He cited some specific facts from a series of unequal treaties such as the "Treaty of Wangxia" and the "Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" to illustrate that American imperialism has always been an enemy that invaded our country. He also used the atrocities that the American devils had seen with their own eyes in Beijing and Tianjin, such as raping Chinese women and crushing people to death with cars, to arouse everyone's hatred of American imperialism. As a result, some people suddenly realized and said: "Isn't that right? The guns and cannons used by Chiang Kai-shek were all given by the Americans?" Some said: "Relief flour is sugar-coated, and the American's heart is dark and cruel."

    An Zhiwen also guided the reading group members to raise questions, freely discuss, and conduct in-depth discussions based on their ideological situation. Then, he would further explain based on the questions raised by everyone. This greatly educated and improved the reading group members' level of understanding.

    In November of last year, after the members of An Zhiwen's reading group read the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties," they knew that the United States wanted to invade China by following Japan's old path, and everyone wanted to bite off a few pieces of flesh from the Japanese devils and the American devils. But when it came to aiding Korea, some people didn't say much. An Zhiwen knew that there must be a reason for this, so he said to everyone in his spare time: "Say anything you want, and if you say something wrong, say it again." Gradually, someone said: "Isn't Korea just a bunch of Goryeo sticks? They are as hateful as the Japanese devils. Why should we help them?" Some people told a lot of atrocities about the Goryeo sticks selling white flour, opening opium dens, beating people at will, and kidnapping during the Japanese rule. After An Zhiwen discovered this situation, he told everyone the vivid stories reported in the newspaper about General Kim Il-sung and the Chinese and Korean people fighting together in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War. Someone listened and said: "It turns out that there are many good people in Korea, and the Goryeo sticks are a minority." Seeing that everyone's thinking had changed a little, An Zhiwen hung a map of Korea on the wall and explained it to everyone. It was explained that the area north of the original "38th parallel" was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by General Kim Il-sung; the area south of the original "38th parallel" was the ruling area of the Lee Seung-man puppet government. In the past, they were Japanese lackeys and followed Japan in doing evil in China. After Japan surrendered, they became American lackeys again, helping the United States to oppress the Korean people and becoming accomplices in the American invasion of Asia. Some people then realized: "The Goryeo sticks are just a small group of reactionaries led by Lee Seung-man, and they are the same as Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in China." At the same time, they also understood that "aiding Korea" was precisely to oppose those "Goryeo sticks." This discussion was very lively, and even the old lady who never spoke spoke. Everyone realized: "The Goryeo sticks, Japan, American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, and secret agents are all in cahoots; Kim Il-sung, China, and the working people of the whole world are one family." That night, eighteen comfort bags were rushed out, and each person wrote a letter of condolences.

    In order to improve everyone's cultural level, An Zhiwen also combined reading newspapers with learning culture.

    An Zhiwen's team did not pay attention to this at first. Someone said, "We have listened to the newspaper for so many days, but we haven't learned a few words!" After everyone discussed, each person prepared a small notebook to write down what they didn't understand, or write down the unfamiliar characters in the newspaper. After reading the newspaper, they would ask the group leader or look up the dictionary. Everyone became more and more interested in reading. An Zhiwen's reading group has gradually been consolidated and regularized.

    After reading the newspaper, the political consciousness of the group members has been improved, and their patriotic enthusiasm has been greatly increased. The three An brothers wrote a letter requesting to join the Volunteer Army and donated more than 30 books to the Volunteer Army. An Shiwen donated one hundred and twenty-five silver dollars that he had saved for many years, and An Shiwen's wife donated her only eight silver dollars. The seventy-year-old old lady An donated the towel that she had been reluctant to use for two or three years. Other listeners, such as vendors Zhang Baoshun and Ma Yao, used to be indifferent to everything, but now they have become active! Some have become group leaders of vendors, and some have become health group leaders.

    The patriotic actions of the members of An Zhiwen's reading group are also reflected in their automatic participation in the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea. When the group leader An Zhiwen went to Dongxiao City to sell socks, he would tell everyone the news from the newspaper as soon as he saw the vendors were free. When there were many people, he would speak to everyone with a loudspeaker. When eating in a restaurant, he would also seize the time to do propaganda when he met bricklayers, carpenters, ditch diggers and the restaurant owner. This March, after he served as the director of the current affairs study group of the Dongxiao City vendor organization, the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea became more regular. An Zhiwen's brothers, An Shiwen and An Yuwen, also told the vendors and acquaintances about what they had heard in the newspaper and the facts that they had personally suffered from the persecution of the Japanese puppets. Under the influence of their propaganda, the tax group led by An Shiwen in Dongxiao City took the lead in playing a model role in paying taxes. In the past six months, they have always paid collectively in the afternoon after the tax bill was issued in the morning. If someone didn't have money, someone else would pay for them first. This promoted other vendors to actively pay taxes.

　　安致文的读报组
    本报记者　傅冬
    北京市七区太阳宫安致文读报组，在组织形式上，读报内容和方法上，已摸索出一条通过读报组来进行经常性的抗美援朝宣传的重要经验。
    安致文读报组在去年五月刚成立时，组织很大。十多个组员，都是太阳宫一带的织袜工人和摊贩。大家不住在一个院里，活又很忙。但是，读报组有一个“每天八点钟读报，人不到齐不读”的死板的规定。结果，常常是这个来了，那个走了，左等右等，一晚上白白地过去了。大伙都觉得读报成了包袱。于是开了一次检讨会。决定由安家三兄弟和安玉文妻子四人，组成一个中心小组，公推安致文当组长。如有重要消息或问题需要讨论时，再写条子通知其他的人来参加。这样，有了骨干分子，再结合群众，就保证了天天能读报。组长安致文认识问题的水平比其他组员都高。他有不懂的地方，再写信问人民日报。同时，读报的时间也不规定得那样死板了，而以不影响生产为原则。这以后就常在晚饭休息时读报了。这样改变后，来听读报的人多起来了。差不多每天一吃过晚饭，附近几家织袜子的工人，就来听读报。
    读报的内容和方法也改进了。安致文刚被大伙选为读报组组长时，工作很积极，每天从外面回来，有时连饭都顾不上吃，就忙着给大伙念报。念的多是一些大块文章，一念就要念到夜晚十一、二点，有时甚至要拖到深夜两、三点钟，把大伙拖得很疲劳，到第二天干活都没精神了，有一天，安致文发现自己在辛辛苦苦地念报，组员们却都没注意听，有些组员不知什么时候偷偷地溜走了。留下的三个组员中，有两个在谈闲天，有一个在低头看小说。这种情况使他感到苦恼。
    发现了这种毛病，大伙又开了一次检讨会。决定报纸来到后，先由中心小组的人仔细看一遍。在给大伙读或开讨论会以前，小组里的人先交换一下群众的思想情况，了解了群众迫切需要知道的问题，再结合当前时事的中心问题和当前中心工作，选择新闻来读。读前由组长作准备，把许多有连带关系的新闻溶化起来，读的时候，用通俗的话，像讲故事一样地来说明新闻的主要意思。
    当美国发动侵朝战争初期，有一些人骂：“美国真不是好东西！”另一些人思想还搞不通。有两个老头就这样说：“怎么说美国坏呢？美国给过咱救济面！”
    安致文等就针对这一思想情况，把报上登过的美国飞机不断侵入我东北境内侦察、轰炸、扫射、美国侵占我台湾、美国军舰在山东炮轰并非法盘查我国商船，以及美国不断供给蒋介石飞机坦克的具体事实，连起来讲给大伙听。他从“望厦条约”和“中美友好通商航海条约”等一连串的不平等条约里，举出一些具体的事实，说明美帝国主义一贯是侵略我国的敌人。又用美国鬼子在北京天津强奸我国妇女，用车子压死人等群众亲眼看到过的暴行，来激发大伙对美帝国主义的仇视情绪。这样一来，一些群众才恍然大悟说：“可不是吗？蒋介石用的枪炮那一样不是美国人给的？”有的说：“救济面是糖衣，美国的心眼，又黑又狠。”
    安致文还根据读报组员的思想情况，诱导他们提出问题，自由漫谈，深入讨论。然后再根据大伙所提出的问题作进一步的讲解。这样就大大教育与提高了读报组员的认识水平。
    去年十一月间，安致文读报组的组员读了“各民主党派联合宣言”后，知道了美国要按着日本的老路来侵略中国，个个都恨不得去咬日本鬼子和美国鬼子几块肉。可是一谈到援朝，有些人就不多啃声了。安致文知道里面一定有缘故，就在闲谈时给大伙说：“有什么话随便说，说错了重说。”渐渐就有人说了：“朝鲜不就是高丽棒子吗？他们和日本鬼子一样可恨。为什么我们还要去援助他们？”有的人就把高丽棒子在日本统治时卖白面、开大烟馆、随便打人、绑票等暴行，诉说了一大堆。安致文发现这情况后，就把报上登过的金日成将军和中朝人民在东北抗日战争中一块作战的生动故事说给大伙听。有人听了就说：“原来朝鲜是好人多，高丽棒子是少数。”安致文见大伙的思想有些转变了，又把朝鲜地图挂在墙上给大伙讲。说明朝鲜原“三八”线以北是金日成将军领导的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国；原“三八”线以南是李承晚傀儡政府统治区，他们过去当日本的狗腿子，跟上日本在中国为非作歹。日本投降后，他们又变成美国的狗腿子，帮助美国压迫朝鲜人民，并成为美国侵略亚洲的帮凶，有些人这才弄清了：“高丽棒子就是李承晚那一小撮反动派，他们和中国的蒋介石匪帮一样。”同时，也明白了“援朝”正是为了反对那些“高丽棒子”。这次讨论会开得很热烈，连一向不发言的老太太都说话了。大伙认清了：“高丽棒子、日本、美帝国主义、蒋介石、特务是一鼻孔出气；金日成、中国、和全世界劳动人民是一家。”当天晚上，就赶做了十八个慰问袋，每人写了一封慰问信。
    为提高大伙文化程度，安致文还把读报和学习文化结合起来。
    安致文小组开始没注意到这点，有人就说：“咱听了这么多天报，字没识几个！”经大伙讨论，每个人预备个小本子，把听不懂的记下来，或把报上不认得的生字写出来。读完报后，再问组长或查字典。大伙越读越有兴趣。安致文的读报组，也就逐渐巩固和经常化起来。
    读报后，组员的政治觉悟提高，爱国热情大大提高了。安家三兄弟曾写信请求参加志愿军，并捐出三十多本书给志愿军。安世文把他存了多年的一百二十五块银元，安世文老婆把她仅有的八块银元也都捐献出来。七十多岁的安老太太，则把她放两三年舍不得用的毛巾捐出来。其他听众像小贩张宝顺、马耀等，过去对什么事都不闻不问，现在都积极起来了！有的当了摊贩小组长，有的作了卫生组长。
    安致文读报组组员的爱国行动，还表现在他们自动地参加了抗美援朝的宣传工作。组长安致文到东晓市卖袜子时，一看见摊贩有空，就给大伙讲报上的消息。人多的时候，他就用大喇叭筒对大伙讲。到饭铺吃饭时，遇见瓦匠、木匠、挖沟工人和饭铺的掌柜，他也抓紧时间来宣传。今年三月，他担任东晓市摊贩组织的时事学习会的主任后，对抗美援朝的宣传更经常化了。安致文的兄弟安世文、安玉文，也把在报上听到的和自己亲身受过日伪迫害的事实，讲给摊贩们和熟人们听。在他们宣传的影响下，东晓市安世文领导的税务小组，在缴税上首先起了模范作用。半年来，每次都是税单上午下来，下午他们就集体去交。谁家没钱，先由别家给垫上。推动了其他的摊贩踊跃纳税。
