To the Editor:
　　Our Lianghe Village Joint Cooperative of the Third District of Pingshan County signed a coal transportation contract with the state-owned Shijiazhuang Transfer Station of the Automobile Transportation Company in April of this year. The coal that the Shijiazhuang Transfer Station should have transported completely before April 30th has only been nearly half transported by today—May 25th. Such a lack of credibility greatly hinders the progress of our cooperative's business. I am writing the details now in the hope of helping to resolve the issue. Our cooperative is located on the north bank of the Hutuo River. In order to solve the fuel difficulties of the cooperative members (the lack of local fuel is the biggest difficulty in people's lives), we borrowed 20 million yuan from the People's Bank to order 100 tons of Fengshan raw coal and 30 tons of medium coal from the Shijiazhuang Coal Plant. Regarding the transportation of this batch of coal, Comrade Gai Xinyou, the business section chief of our cooperative, contacted the state-owned Shijiazhuang Transfer Station of the Automobile Transportation Company. It was agreed that the company would be responsible for transporting it to Lianghe Village, Pingshan County, at a freight rate of 60 yuan per catty, starting on April 25th, and completing the entire transportation within one week. According to the agreement at the time, our cooperative had already paid all the freight, a total of 8 million yuan, to the Pingshan Transfer Station, and the station issued a receipt at the time. However, as of May 25th, the company had only transported 57 tons and 400 catties of coal, and still owed 72 tons and 1,600 catties of coal that had not been transported. When we urged them, they only said they would transport it, but in reality, they still did not transport it. It is now the rainy season, and our cooperative members urgently need fuel. Moreover, we have to pay interest on the loan we took from the bank. If it is delayed any further, the Hutuo River will rise, causing transportation to be blocked and unable to be transported. Who should be responsible for this matter? Because this matter is very important, we hope the editor can help resolve it.

### 汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈为何不遵守运煤合同？

　　汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈为何不遵守运煤合同？编辑同志：
    我们平山县第三区两合村联村合作社在今年四月间与国营汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈，订立了一项运煤合同。石家庄转运栈，在四月三十日以前应运完的煤，到今天——五月二十五日才运了近一半。这样不讲信用，大大妨碍了我社的业务进展。现将详情写出来，希望帮助解决。我社在滹沱河的北岸，为了解决社员燃料困难（当地燃料缺乏，是人民生活中最大的困难），即向人民银行贷款二千万元到石家庄煤厂订购凤山原煤一百吨，中煤三十吨。关于这批煤的运输问题，当时由本社业务股长盖信有同志与国营汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈接洽，言定由该公司负责运到平山县两河村，每斤运费六十元，四月二十五日开始，在一星期内全数运完。并按照当时的商定，我社已将全部运费共八百万元交到平山转运栈，当时并由该栈立下凭据。但是至五月二十五日，该公司还只运来五十七吨零四百斤煤，尚欠七十二吨零一千六百斤煤没有运到。我们去催促一次，他们只说运，而实际仍不运，目前已到雨季，我社社员需用燃料很急，而且我们向银行贷的款要出利息。如再迟延，滹沱河涨水，使交通阻隔而不能运来，这事究应由谁负责？因为此事关系甚为重要，我们希望编辑同志帮助解决。
