            Blocking the Road to War
    On June 4th, three patriotic Danish youths, Leo Ensen and others, in protest against the United States transporting arms to Denmark, chained themselves to the rails of the railway trunk line near the Aarhus train station, preventing the departure of two trains carrying American munitions. As a result, these three individuals were taken to the police station, but thousands of local residents who witnessed the situation protested angrily, forcing the police to release them.
            No Changing Farmland into Battlefields
    Due to the expansion of the Hammelburg tank training ground by the Americans in Bavaria, West Germany, 1,800 farming families have had to move out of seven nearby villages. The confiscated farmland will reach 4,164 hectares, with a total value of 30 million marks. 1,642 hectares of forest will also be cut down. Farmers are now holding rallies to protest American military preparations.
            The "Freedom" to Kill
    According to an Associated Press reporter, Joseph Mann, a 39-year-old black pastor in Virginia, USA, was recently burned to death by two white men for opposing segregation in his sermons. They poured gasoline on him and then pushed him into another black man's house that they had set on fire.
    This is the so-called "democracy" of the United States: black people do not have the freedom to demand freedom, while white people have the freedom to arbitrarily kill black people.

            堵住战争的道路
    六月四日，三个丹麦爱国青年里奥·恩森等，为了抗议美国运送军火给丹麦，用链子把自己缚在亚胡斯的火车站附近铁路干线的铁轨上，阻止了载运美国军火的两列火车的开行。结果这三个人被送到警察局去，但是目睹当时情况的当地几千居民，愤慨地提出抗议，迫使警察不得不把他们释放。
            不准变耕地为战场
    由于美国人在西德巴伐利亚州的哈麦尔堡扩大坦克教练场，有一千八百家农户因此不得不从附近七个村庄迁出。被充公的耕地将达四千一百六十四公顷，总价值达三千万马克。一千六百四十二公顷的森林也将被砍掉。农民们现在正在纷纷举行大会，抗议美国的军事准备。
            杀人的“自由”
    据美联社记者报道，美国弗吉尼亚州一个三十九岁的黑人牧师约瑟夫·曼，最近因在传教中反对将黑人隔离而被两个白人烧死。他们把汽油倒在他的身上，然后把他推进他们纵火焚烧的另一个黑人的房屋中。
    这就是美国的所谓“民主”：黑人没有要求自由的自由，而白人有任意杀害黑人的自由。
