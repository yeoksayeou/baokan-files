The Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Administration, in its preparations for implementing the economic accounting system, neglected ideological education for its employees and took a detour. Before March of this year, when the depot was conducting the "Two Checks" work of verifying work hours and consumption quotas, the workers only knew that they were going to implement an economic accounting system, but they didn't know why. They said, "Implementing the economic accounting system is a matter for the cadres, it has nothing to do with us!" Some workers mistakenly thought, "Accounting, accounting, it just means they want us to work harder anyway!" In this situation, some quota-checking personnel rashly started working. They didn't explain the meaning of quota-checking to the workers, only stood behind them, recording their working hours. The workers were very strange: "Why are the quota-checking personnel always following us? As soon as we move, they write?" Some workers satirized the quota-checking personnel: "You keep writing! What can you figure out? If we burn coal and open the firebox wider, we waste coal. If we open it smaller, we save coal. Do you understand?" Some quota-checking personnel simply pursued the lowest standard of material consumption, which made the workers very dissatisfied. For example, one quota-checking person personally went to locomotive "No. 1588" to check oil consumption. He personally gave oil to the crew. The general standard for oiling a locomotive is three drops per minute, but he only gave one drop every forty seconds. He thought, "This standard is right!" As a result, the locomotive suffered wear and tear accidents. This not only made the workers uneasy but also hindered the preparation for the economic accounting system.

The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the depot discovered this deviation, immediately consulted with the trade union, and organized cadres and workers to study the economic accounting system. This made the cadres realize, "Only by relying on the masses can we do a good job in the 'Two Checks' work!" After the workers studied the economic accounting system, they learned that implementing the economic accounting system is an important method for running factories well and is beneficial to both the country and individuals. Therefore, the workers said, "We must help the quota-checking personnel to do a good job in preparing for economic accounting!" Young workers Xu Xin and Song Dianlin voluntarily handed over the materials stored in the small warehouse, and the water pump group handed over more than one hundred kilograms of scrap copper. They said to the trade union, "In order to correctly check the consumption quota, how can we keep the small warehouse?" Some workers took the initiative to contact the quota-checking personnel and reported their work, their production time, and the real situation of material consumption. This also educated the quota-checking personnel that they must rely on the worker masses to carry out economic accounting work. Therefore, the depot was able to carry out the "Two Checks" work normally and revised some unreasonable and overly high standards in the past.

　　天津铁路管理局丰台机务段
    忽视了对职工进行思想教育
    经济核算准备工作走了弯路
    天津铁路管理局丰台机务段在实行经济核算制的准备工作中，忽视了对职工进行经济核算的思想教育，曾走了一段弯路。在今年三月以前，该段进行查定工时和查定消费定额的两查工作时，工人们只知道要实行经济核算制，但不知道为什么要实行。他们说：“实行经济核算制是干部的事，和咱们没关系！”有些工人错误地认为：“核算，核算，反正就是要咱们多干活！”在这种情况下，有些查标（查定标准）人员冒然地就进行工作。他们不向工人说明查定标准的意义，仅站在工人的后面，记录工人的工时。工人非常奇怪：“为什么查标人员老跟着咱们，咱们一动，他就写？”有的工人就讽刺查标人员：“你记吧！能得出个什么名堂呢！咱们烧火，开大一点火口就费煤，开小一点就省煤，你明白吗？”有些查标人员单纯地追求材料消费的最低标准，使得工人非常不满。比如有个查标人员亲自跑到“一五八八号”机车上，检查油的消费量，他亲自替乘务员给油。一般机车的给油标准是每分钟三滴，但他每四十秒只给一滴油，他以为：“这个标准对！”结果使该机车发生磨耗事故。这样，不仅使工人情绪不安，而且也阻碍了经济核算制的准备工作的进行。
    该段中国共产党总支委员会发现了这样的偏向，马上和工会商量，组织干部和工人学习经济核算制，使干部认识到：“只有依靠群众，才能搞好两查工作！”工人们学习了经济核算制，知道了实行经济核算制是搞好工厂的重要方法，是对国家对个人都有利益的事情。因此工人们说：“咱们要帮助查标人员搞好经济核算的准备工作！”青年工人徐鑫、宋殿林自动地交出小仓库的存料，水泵组交出废铜一百多公斤。他们对工会说：“为了正确地查消费定额，咱们怎能保存着小仓库？”有些工人主动地和查标人员联系，报告自己工作的情况，自己的生产时间和材料消费的真实情况。这样也教育了查标人员，必须依靠工人群众，才能进行经济核算工作。因此该段遂能正常地进行了两查工作，修改了过去某些不合理的过高标准。                        （曹瑞麟）
