　　Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 8th: Australian dockworkers in all ports held a 24-hour general strike on the 5th to protest the Australian government's illegal interrogation of Healy, the general secretary of the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation and a communist. The Australian government accused Healy on May 29th because the Waterside Workers' Federation and its branches, led by Healy, refused to work on ships traveling between New Zealand and Australia in solidarity with the striking New Zealand dockworkers. When the court interrogated Healy on the 5th, dockworkers and sailors in all ports stopped working and held demonstrations, and coal miners in the north and south also went on strike to protest. More than two thousand dockworkers in Sydney held a demonstration in front of the courthouse. Currently, despite the Australian Minister for Labour Holt publicly threatening on the 7th to recruit other workers to load and unload ships to and from New Zealand, the dockworkers still insist on united action and refuse to work on these ships.

　　澳大利亚码头工人罢工        
    抗议非法审讯工会领袖
    【新华社八日讯】悉尼讯：澳大利亚全国各港口码头工人于五日举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议澳政府非法审讯澳大利亚码头工人联合会总书记共产党人赫利。澳大利亚政府曾于五月二十九日控告赫利，原因是赫利领导的码头工人联合会及各个分会拒绝为来往新西兰与澳大利亚之间的船只工作，以声援坚持罢工的新西兰码头工人。当法庭在五日审讯赫利时，全国各港口的码头工人和海员都同时停止工作并举行示威，北部与南部的煤矿矿工也都罢工抗议。悉尼两千多名码头工人就在法庭门前面举行了示威。目前，尽管澳政府劳工部长霍尔特已于七日公开威胁将另行招募工人来装卸往来新西兰的船只，但是，码头工人们仍然坚持一致行动，拒绝在这些船只上工作。
