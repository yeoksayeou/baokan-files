　　What have I personally experienced?
    What should we do in the future?
    Chen Sisheng, Head of the Third Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, Representative of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles
    I participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea as a representative of Shanghai industrial and commercial circles. In my work, I served as the head of the Third Sub-Group. I went to Korea to express the infinite love and care of the 140 million people of East China and Shanghai for the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Korean people. During the visit, I received a great deal of education and training myself. Now I would like to talk about the various facts I have seen and heard, and my feelings and gains.
    First, in the anti-aggression struggle in Korea, I deeply realized that although the American aggressors possessed superior equipment, the arduous struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers was unparalleled in bravery. The reason they have such an iron will and revolutionary optimism is because of their high political awareness, because the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country is just; and also because the brutality and shamelessness of the American aggressors have aroused their infinite hatred. In battle, they displayed unparalleled bravery and resourcefulness. Therefore, it has become extremely common for them to defeat and annihilate large numbers of American-led bandit troops with a small number of troops. The morale of the Chinese and Korean soldiers is unprecedentedly high. There is only one path ahead for the American aggressor troops, and that is complete defeat and annihilation.
    Second, this time I went to Korea and realized more deeply that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of all Asia and the world. It is entirely correct for us to put forward the slogan of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country; to defend our homes and country, we must resist America and aid Korea. As soon as we crossed the Yalu River, we first saw the cities in the Xinyizhou area being bombed and strafed by American imperialism, with few intact houses. The peaceful villages we saw along the way also suffered the same tragic disaster. Please think about it, Korea and our motherland are only separated by a river, dependent on each other like lips and teeth. If it were not for our People's Volunteers heroically going abroad to jointly resist the common enemy with the Korean People's Army, and not cutting off the enemy's bloody claws of aggression outside the gate of our motherland, could we be able to produce and build with such peace of mind today?
    Third, I went to Pyongyang and, with other representatives of industrial and commercial circles in the delegation, warmly visited Korean industrial and commercial figures. In our sincere conversations, I realized that Korean industrial and commercial circles are fighting the enemy, restoring production, and supporting the front lines in hardship. This spirit, full of confidence in victory and perseverance, deeply moved me. We personally saw the factories and shops in the prosperous city of Pyongyang destroyed by American robbers, and we cordially cared for the Korean industrial and commercial figures. At the same time, we thought more about the loveliness of our motherland and the vigorous development of Chinese industry and commerce after liberation. We should be grateful for the wise leadership of the brilliant Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, which has allowed us to have such a good life of peace and contentment today. We should not hesitate to do our best to improve production and increase production to support the front lines, which is to work hard to strengthen production for the front lines and for the soldiers. We must clearly recognize that as long as imperialism exists, we cannot engage in peaceful construction with peace of mind. At the same time, I deeply realized in Korea that imperialism is the mortal enemy of our industrialists and businessmen. A private entrepreneur in Pyongyang told us: "During the month or so that the American aggressors occupied Pyongyang, they destroyed our private shops and factories. When they retreated, they took away our machines and rubber raw materials, and even the stocking machines in nearby villages!" These ironclad facts show that American imperialists are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people in the world. In Korea, on the one hand, we witnessed the terrible destruction of Korea, and on the other hand, we saw that our People's Volunteers resolutely refused to allow the flames of American imperialist aggression to spread to our motherland, and heroically fought side by side with the Korean people against the American aggressors with a lofty spirit of internationalism. This noble behavior of the People's Volunteers is to defend their homes and country, to protect our peaceful construction, and to protect our free life.
    Fourth, we must further realize that today's American imperialism is carrying out frantic aggression. Although its morale is low and its life is corrupt, we cannot have a careless attitude and think that we can easily win the war in Korea. We must know that the enemy is still struggling desperately, relying on their large amount of steel. Therefore, the people of the whole country must be more vigilant. The industrial and commercial circles of the whole country have a glorious patriotic tradition in the past, and they must continue to deepen the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and universally sign patriotic covenants, and must earnestly implement the patriotic covenants. We must contribute all our strength with practical actions to support the front lines. In order to ensure war supplies, we must step up production, promote exchanges between urban and rural areas, and enrich material supplies. In order to increase combat power, we must have foresight and long-term plans. We must stick to our production posts and overcome difficulties so that the front lines can receive more powerful support and achieve greater victories. When the delegation went to Korea to extend their regards, our volunteers expressed great excitement for the support and regards of the people of the whole country. They said: "A cigarette, a piece of candy, all represent the hearts of the people of the motherland!" After this visit, we deeply understood that the materials we donated before were not practical enough. For example, nutritional items, medical equipment, and transportation vehicles all need to be carefully studied, effective and concrete plans made, widely collected, and sent to the front lines.
    Finally, in order to defeat the enemy as soon as possible, in my capacity as a representative of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles, and as a member of the democratic party—the China Democratic National Construction Association, I call on the industrial and commercial circles and people from all walks of life in Shanghai and the whole country to launch a campaign to donate airplanes and cars to support the front lines, and vow to be the backing of the heroic Chinese and Korean soldiers who are fighting the enemy!

　　我亲身体会到些什么？
    我们今后应该做些什么？
    中国人民赴朝慰问团第三分团团长上海工商界代表  陈巳生
    我是以上海工商界代表的身份参加中国人民赴朝慰问团的。在工作中，我担任了第三分团的团长。我是带着华东及上海市一亿四千万人民对英勇战斗中的中朝人民军队及朝鲜人民的无限热爱与关怀，到朝鲜去慰问的。在慰问过程中，我自己受到了很大的教育和锻炼。现在我把所见所闻的各种事实和我的感想与收获谈谈。
    第一、在朝鲜的反侵略战斗中，我深刻地认识到尽管美国侵略者拥有较优势的装备，但朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的艰苦斗争是无比勇敢的。他们所以有这样的钢铁意志和革命的乐观主义精神，是因为政治觉悟高，因为抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争是正义的；也因为美国侵略者的残暴无耻，激发了他们的无比仇恨。在战斗中，他们表现着无比的英勇和机智。因此，他们以少数兵力击败和歼灭大量美李匪军已成为极其普遍的事情。中朝战士的士气空前旺盛。美国侵略军的前途只有一条，就是彻底失败和被彻底消灭。
    第二、这次我到了朝鲜，更深刻地认识到帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义是中朝人民和全亚洲、全世界人民的共同敌人。我们提出抗美援朝保家卫国的口号，是十分正确的；要保家卫国，就必须抗美援朝。我们一过鸭绿江，首先看见新义州一带的城市被美帝国主义轰炸扫射，很少整的房屋。我们一路看到的和平乡村，亦受到同样的悲惨灾难。请大家想一想，朝鲜和我们祖国仅一江之隔，唇齿相依，要不是我们人民志愿军这样英雄地出国，与朝鲜人民军共同抗击共同的敌人，不把敌人血淋淋的侵略魔爪斩断在祖国大门外边，我们今天能够这样安心生产和安心建设吗？
    第三、我在平壤与慰问团中其他的工商界的代表曾热烈地去慰问朝鲜工商界人士。在彼此恳切的谈话之中，我体会到朝鲜工商界在苦难中与敌人斗争，恢复生产，支援前线。这种充满胜利的信心和坚毅不屈的精神，使我受到很深的感动。我们亲眼看到繁荣的平壤城的工厂和商店为美国强盗摧毁，我们亲切地关怀着朝鲜工商界人士，同时，更想到我们祖国的可爱，想到我们中国工商业在解放后的蓬勃发展。我们应当感激英明的毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府正确的领导，使我们才有今天安居乐业的好日子。我们更应该毫不犹豫全心全力搞好生产，增加生产，来支援前线，也就是努力为前线为战士加强生产。我们要认识清楚帝国主义存在一天，我们就不能安心地从事和平建设。同时，我在朝鲜深刻认清帝国主义是我们工商业者的死敌。平壤一位私营企业家对我们说：“美国侵略者在侵占平壤的一个多月中，把我们私营的商店工厂都破坏了，当他们溃退时把我们的机器和橡胶原料甚至附近乡村的织袜机都搬走了！”这种铁的事实，说明美帝国主义者是全世界一切爱好和平人民的死敌。我们在朝鲜一方面目击朝鲜被破坏之惨，一方面看到我人民志愿军断然不肯让美帝国主义侵略火焰延烧到祖国，以崇高的国际主义的精神，与朝鲜人民英勇地并肩抗击美国侵略者。人民志愿军的这种崇高行为，就是为了保家卫国，保卫我们的和平建设，保卫我们的自由生活。
    第四、我们还要进一步认识到今日美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，虽然他的士气低落，生活腐朽，但我们还不能存轻敌的思想，以为我们在朝鲜战争中就可以轻易地获得胜利。要知敌人依靠他们钢铁多，还是在竭力挣扎。因此，全国人民更要提高警惕。全国工商业界，有过去光荣的爱国传统，要继续深入抗美援朝运动，普遍签订爱国公约，并且要切实执行爱国公约。我们要以实际行动，贡献一切力量，支援前线，为了要保证战争供给，必须加紧生产，促进城乡交流，充实物资供应。为了增加战斗力量，必须要有远见和长远的打算。要坚守生产岗位，克服困难，使前线得到更有力的支援，获得更大的胜利。这次慰问团到朝鲜慰问时，我们志愿军对全国人民的支援和慰问，表示十分兴奋。他们说：“一支香烟，一块糖，都是代表着祖国人民的心！”我们经过这次慰问，深深地了解以前我们捐献的物资还不够切合实际，例如营养物品、医药器材、交通工具各方面，都需要好好地研究，作出有效的具体计划，广泛征集，送到前线去。
    最后，为了提早战胜敌人，我以上海工商界代表的资格，并以民主党派——民主建国会会员的身份，向上海和全国工商界及各界人士号召，发起捐献飞机和汽车运动，来支援前线，誓为英勇抗敌的中朝战士的后盾！
