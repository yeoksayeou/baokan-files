　　Public enterprises in Guannei (within the passes) have begun to reform the chaotic and unreasonable wage systems inherited from the Kuomintang rule. In September of last year, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government convened a national wage preparation meeting, which drafted a draft wage regulation, clearly stipulating the principles of wage system reform across the country. After the meeting, many regions in Guannei successively held wage conferences, conducted systematic investigations and studies on the current wage situation, and prepared for the reform of the wage system with reference to the draft wage regulations prepared by the national wage preparation meeting. In December of last year, the Northwest region first obtained the approval of the Central Finance and Economics Committee and began to adjust wages. Up to now, the wage adjustment work of the petroleum industry in the Northwest region has entered the stage of wage evaluation. With the help of the work team of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the wage adjustment work of the postal and telecommunications departments in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces has also been completed. The wage adjustment work of public enterprises in Shanxi Province began in state-owned enterprises in January of this year, and later expanded to larger provincial and municipal enterprises. So far, state-owned enterprises such as the province's power industry have been adjusted, and other enterprises are being adjusted. After the wage adjustment plan in the Central and Southern China region was approved by the Central Finance and Economics Committee, the region is currently conducting trial wage reforms in four important factories and mines, preparing to gain experience before promoting it to the entire region. In addition, state-owned and provincial-operated larger enterprises in Shandong and Chahar provinces are also adjusting wages. In terms of industrial systems, after the wage adjustment plan of the railway department was approved by the Central Finance and Economics Committee, it is currently making preparations and will soon be fully adjusted in all railway bureaus in Guannei. Other major industries are also starting or preparing to carry out wage adjustments in directly affiliated units in North China.
　　The chaotic and unreasonable situation of the wage system left over from the Kuomintang rule mainly includes: the wages of light industry are higher than those of heavy industry; the wages in areas where industry particularly needs to be developed are lower than those in other areas; the wage standards for the same technology in the same industrial system are not uniform and vary greatly; in particular, the multi-level egalitarian wage system seriously hinders the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in production. In addition, the wage calculation units in various regions and industries are also inconsistent, and there are many types of disguised wages. These chaotic and unreasonable situations have become the main reasons for the labor force's mobility and the inability of workers to actively study and improve their skills.
　　The wage reform work of public enterprises in various parts of Guannei can be roughly divided into three types: one is to implement the eight-level wage system based on technical standards and in accordance with the principle of pay according to work, with appropriate increases in wages. The second is to make relatively reasonable internal adjustments under the principle that the total wage remains basically unchanged. The third is that piece-rate wages were originally implemented, but the work quota and piece-rate method were unreasonable, so the work quota was first reviewed and revised according to the technical quota determination method, and then adjusted; or because the original labor organization was unreasonable, the labor organization was improved first, and then the adjustment was made.
　　In the process of reform, all localities generally grasped the three principles determined by the National Wage Preparation Conference last year, namely: First, adjust as reasonably as possible within the possible range to lay a preliminary foundation for a unified and reasonable wage system throughout the country; second, take care of reality and be supported by the majority of workers and staff; third, take care of the country's financial and economic capabilities and not increase the state's burden too much. The reform of the wage system in various localities is generally carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner under the direct leadership of the local people's government's financial and economic committee, and most of them change the multi-level wage system to the eight-level wage system, and take into account the balance of standards between regions and industries. Therefore, the reform work has generally achieved good results.
　　The experience of wage system reform in various localities proves that the eight-level wage system is a relatively scientific and reasonable wage system. It is not only feasible in the socialist Soviet Union and the advanced Northeast region, but also feasible in the Guannei region with multi-level wages. Workers at the Qingdao Waterworks said: "In the past, having skills was useless, but now the eight-level wage system is good." Because the eight-level wage system assesses wages based on the degree of labor proficiency, and the difference between the eight levels is large, getting promoted to a higher level can result in much more wages, so after the implementation of this system, workers generally demand to learn technology and culture. For example, in a factory in Shanxi, workers were unwilling to spend money to buy cultural textbooks that cost 1,000 yuan last year; now, "mechanical drawing" which sells for more than 10,000 or 20,000 yuan is being snapped up by more than 300 people. In another factory, people who participated in the spare-time cultural learning class were originally not very active, but after the implementation of the eight-level wage system, 100% of them can study on time. At the same time, experience in various places has proved that wage adjustment must be well prepared. The preparation work mainly includes formulating wage adjustment plans, formulating or revising technical standards, repeatedly conducting ideological education for all employees, and deeply mobilizing the masses. The method of wage evaluation is best to evaluate from top to bottom with leadership and standards first, and then mobilize the masses to discuss and revise, which is more realistic than the method of "self-reporting, public discussion, and three announcements", because it can avoid the phenomenon of "mutually raising" without standards.

### 关内各公营企业开始改革旧工资制度

　　关内各公营企业开始改革旧工资制度
    关内各地公营企业已开始对国民党统治时期遗留下来的混乱的不合理的工资制度进行了一些改革。去年九月中央人民政府劳动部召开的全国工资准备会议，曾草拟了工资条例草案，明确规定了全国工资制度的改革原则。会后，关内不少地区都先后举行了工资会议，对现行工资情况进行了系统的调查研究，并参照全国工资准备会议草拟的工资条例草案进行了改革工资制度的准备工作。去年十二月，西北地区首先得到中央财政经济委员会的批准，开始调整工资。迄目前止，西北区石油工业的工资调整工作已进入评资阶段。甘肃、青海、宁夏三省邮电部门，在中央邮电部工作队的帮助下，工资调整工作也已完成。山西省公营企业的调整工资工作于今年一月首先在国营企业中进行，以后又扩大到省、市营较大企业中。迄今为止，全省电业等国营企业已调整完毕，其他企业正在调整中。中南地区的调整工资方案经中央财政经济委员会批准后，目前该区正在四个重要厂矿试行改革工资工作，准备取得经验后再推广到全区。此外，山东、察哈尔两省的国营及省营较大企业也正在调整工资。产业系统方面，铁路部门在该部门工资调整方案经中央财政经济委员会批准后，目前正进行准备工作，不久将在关内各路局全面调整。其他各主要产业也在华北地区各直属单位开始或准备进行工资调整工作。
    国民党统治时期遗留下来的工资制度的混乱和不合理的情形，主要是：轻工业的工资比重工业高；工业特别需要发展的地区的工资比其他地区低；同一产业系统内同等技术的工资标准不统一而且高低悬殊；特别是多等级的平均主义的工资制度严重地障碍了职工生产积极性和创造性的发挥。此外各地区各产业的工资计算单位也不一致，变相工资的名目繁多。这些混乱和不合理的情形，就成为劳动力流动，工人不能积极钻研提高技术等不良现象的主要原因。
    关内各地公营企业的工资改革工作，大致可分为三种类型：一种是在适当增加了工资的情况下，根据按劳付酬的原则，依据技术标准，实行了八级工资制。第二种是在工资总额基本不动的原则下，在内部进行了比较合理的调整。第三种是原已实行计件工资，但工作定额和计件方法不合理，因而首先根据技术定额测定法审查改订了工作定额，然后进行了调整；或因原来劳动组织不合理而首先改善了劳动组织，然后才作了调整。
    在改革过程中，各地一般地都掌握了去年全国工资准备会议决定的三个原则，就是：第一，在可能范围内调整得比较合理，以便打下全国统一的合理的工资制度的初步基础；第二，照顾现实，做到为大多数工人职员所拥护；第三，照顾国家财政经济能力，不过多增加国家负担。各地工资制度的改革工作，一般地都是在当地人民政府财政经济委员会直接领导下有计划有步骤地进行的，而且大多是改多等级的工资制为八级工资制，并照顾到地区之间和产业之间标准的平衡。因此，改革工作一般都收到较好的效果。
    各地改革工资制度的经验证明，八级工资制是比较科学、合理的工资制度。它不但在社会主义的苏联行得通，在先进地区的东北行得通，而且在多等级工资的关内也同样行得通。青岛自来水工厂的工人说：“以前有技术白搭，现在有了八级工资制就好了。”因为八级工资制是按劳动熟练程度评定工资的，八级之间的差额较大，升一级能多得很多工资，所以改行这一制度后，工人们即普遍要求学习技术和文化。例如在山西某工厂，去年售价一千元的文化课本，工人们都不愿意花钱买；现在售价一两万元以上的“机械制图”，竟有三百多人抢购。另一个工厂参加业余文化学习班学习的人原来很不积极，改行八级工资制后已百分之百能按时学习。同时，各地经验证明，调整工资要作好准备工作。准备工作主要是制订工资调整方案，制订或修正技术标准，反复地向全体职工进行思想教育，并深入发动群众。评定工资的方法，最好是先自上而下地有领导有标准地评定，然后发动群众讨论修正，这比较“自报公议、三榜定案”的方法更切合实际，因为它能避免漫无标准地“互相抬高”的现象。
