At a rally held in London on the 19th, members of the delegation introduced the Chinese people's desire for peace and their united enthusiasm for building the country to the British people.

The head of the delegation, miner Cain, said: "Upon arriving in China, one cannot help but be immediately moved by the people's expressions of freedom and happiness, as well as their strong desire for peace." When asked about the Chinese people's movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, delegation member and journalist Craig said, "The enthusiasm of the Chinese people is extremely high. Wherever we went, whether in factories, universities, or mines, we saw manifestations of this enthusiasm." Another member, railway worker Ahern, said: "I experienced that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of China."

The delegation issued a statement which said: "We went to observe for ourselves, and we were deeply impressed by the new democratic spirit prevalent throughout China, the universal confidence in the future, and how ordinary people are rapidly learning to manage their own country. China is now truly the land of the people." The statement continued: "The Chinese people are eager to enhance friendship with the British people, and this desire is for the common construction of a peaceful world." The statement concluded: "We believe that the British people will certainly work equally hard to strive for friendship with China and a peaceful world. We must refuse to be drawn into the war against China waged by the United States, demand the immediate withdrawal of our troops from Korea, and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean question on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign troops."

    访问团团长、矿工凯恩说：人们一到中国，就不能不立刻为人民所表现的自由幸福的感情以及他们对和平的强烈愿望所深深感动。访问团团员新闻记者克莱格在回答关于中国人民抗美援朝运动的问题时说道：“中国人民的热情非常之高。我们无论到什么地方，不管是在工厂、在大学还是在矿山里，都看到了这种热情的流露。”另一个团员、铁路工人阿亨说：“我体验到美帝国主义是中国的主要敌人。”
    访问团发表了一项声明，其中说：“我们亲自去观察了，我们看到了全中国各地普遍的新的民主精神，普遍的对将来的信心，看到了普通人民怎样迅速地学会管理自己的国家，这一切都给予我们很深刻的印象。中国现在确实是人民的天下了。”声明接着说：中国人民渴望增进对英国人民的友谊，这种愿望是为了共同建设和平的世界。声明最后说：“我们相信，英国人民必定会同样努力争取与中国的友谊和一个和平的世界。我们必须拒绝卷入美国对中国进行的战争中，要求马上把我国军队撤出朝鲜，并且在撤退一切外国军队的基础上，努力寻求朝鲜问题的和平解决。”
