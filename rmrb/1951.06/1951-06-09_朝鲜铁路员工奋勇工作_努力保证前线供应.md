　　(Xinhua News Agency, June 8th) According to a TASS report from Pyongyang on June 6th: Korean railway workers are working courageously and heroically to ensure supplies to the front lines.
　　The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded the title of Hero of the Republic to Choi Chi-tian (transliteration), stationmaster of the Kaechon Station, and Han Nam-soo, driver of the Sariwon Station. Kaechon Station was awarded the first-class "Freedom and Independence" flag. A large number of advanced railway workers were awarded medals and orders.
　　Choi Chi-tian twice risked his life to save trains loaded with military supplies. Once, American planes strafed a freight train stopped at Kaechon Station with machine guns. The train was loaded with munitions, but there was no locomotive to pull it. One car was hit and caught fire, and the shells on board began to explode. Choi Chi-tian led the station's workers, regardless of the machine-gun fire and the exploding bombs, to separate several cars, thus saving the train from loss. On another occasion, Choi Chi-tian was injured while rescuing a train of burning military supplies, but the train was eventually saved and sent to the front lines.
　　News of the brave and decisive work of railway employees is reported daily. *Labor News* reported that when American bombers bombed a station one time, they dropped more than twenty time bombs, five of which landed on the tracks. Ten members of the Democratic Youth League, led by Bai Xuanji (transliteration), fearlessly removed five 500-kilogram bombs from the train tracks, allowing freight cars to continue to the front lines uninterrupted that day.

　　朝鲜铁路员工奋勇工作
    努力保证前线供应
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社平壤六日讯：朝鲜的铁路员工以勇敢和英雄的行为，努力保证对前线的供应。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会以共和国英雄称号授给价川车站站长崔致田（译音）和沙里院车站司机韩南洙。价川车站荣获一级“自由独立”奖旗。大批先进的铁路员工荣获勋章和奖章。
    崔致田曾两次冒生命危险，救出装有军事供应品的列车。一次，美国飞机用机枪猛烈扫射一列停在价川车站上的货车。这列货车装着军火，但是没有机车牵引。一节车中弹起火，车上的炮弹开始爆炸。崔致田率领车站的工人们不顾机枪的扫射和炸弹的爆炸，把几节车皮分开，因而使这列火车免受损失。另一次，崔致田在抢救燃烧中的一列军事供应品火车时受了伤，但是，列车终于得救，开赴前线。
    每天都有关于铁路员工英勇果敢工作的消息。《劳动新闻》报道：美国轰炸机某次空袭一个车站时，投下了二十多枚定时炸弹，其中五枚落在铁轨上。十位民主青年同盟的盟员，在白玄基（译音）的率领下，奋不顾身，把五枚五百公斤重的炸弹搬出火车轨道，使货车能够在那天不间断地开赴前线。
