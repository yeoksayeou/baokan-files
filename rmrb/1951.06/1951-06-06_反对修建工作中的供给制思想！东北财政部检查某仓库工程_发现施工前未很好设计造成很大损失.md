Oppose the Supply System Mentality in Construction Work!
    Northeast Finance Department Inspects a Warehouse Project
    Discovering Significant Losses Due to Poor Design Before Construction
    The Northeast People's Government Finance Department's warehouse construction project in a certain area, due to not undergoing thorough review and research, commenced construction rashly, resulting in a loss of state assets and difficulties in construction. The warehouse design drawings were submitted to the People's Economic and Financial Department of the Northeast People's Government Finance Department for review on April 2nd, but the contract had already been formally signed on March 23rd, and some of the project had already started construction around March 25th. Although the construction project had been designed twice, some of the design drawings were still being modified as the work progressed, making it impossible for construction to proceed entirely according to the design drawings. Because the design was inadequate, the financial plan was also inaccurate. The extent of the inaccuracy can be seen from the following two projects: one project has reached 25% to 30% of its actual progress, but has only used 11.4% of the originally planned man-days. Preliminary calculations show that the originally planned man-days exceeded the actual man-days by about 35.7%. Another project has reached 20% to 30% of its actual progress, but has only used 7% of the originally planned man-days. The originally planned man-days exceeded the actual man-days by more than 58%. Other projects such as offices, dormitories, and garages also showed signs of overestimation in the labor plan. The selection of the construction site was inappropriate, and the inconvenient transportation led to an increase in the necessary auxiliary equipment. Based on 15 projects, auxiliary equipment accounted for more than 42% of the total project cost estimate, which is a significant waste and reduces the effectiveness of state investment. At the same time, the railway spur line cannot directly reach the warehouse, and transportation costs will also be wasted in the future. After the Northeast People's Government Finance Department sent people to investigate and verify the above situation, it has ordered the organizers to conduct a self-criticism and intends to give appropriate punishment.
    (Editor's note: Starting construction rashly without careful design and regardless of the consequences is a reflection of the supply system mentality in construction work. It not only wastes a huge amount of national manpower and resources, but also affects the progress of national infrastructure construction, which is extremely harmful. It is hoped that departments currently engaged in construction work will carefully examine this issue, like the Northeast Finance Department. If there are similar situations, they must be quickly improved.)

### 反对修建工作中的供给制思想！东北财政部检查某仓库工程  发现施工前未很好设计造成很大损失

　　反对修建工作中的供给制思想！
    东北财政部检查某仓库工程
    发现施工前未很好设计造成很大损失
    东北人民政府财政部某地仓库修建工程，由于没有经过周密审查研究，就冒然施工，造成了国家资财的损失和施工中的困难。该仓库设计图样于四月二日送东北人民政府财政部人民经济财务处审核，但包工合同却早于三月二十三日已正式签订，部分工程在三月二十五日前后即已开始动工。该修建工程虽已设计过两次，但部分设计图样仍在随做随改，使施工不能完全按照设计图样进行。因为设计不周，财务计划也就不准确了。只从以下两件工程来看，就可知道不准确的程度：一个工程目前实际进度已达百分之二十五到三十，只使用了原计划工数的百分之十一点四。初步计算，原计划工数约多出实用工数百分之三十五点七。另一个工程目前实际进度已达百分之二十到三十，只使用了原计划工数的百分之七，原计划工数约多出实用工数百分之五十八以上。其他办公室及宿舍、车库等工程，在人工计划上也有计划过高的现象。该项建筑地址选择不当，交通不便，致使必要的附属设备加大了。根据十五件工程来看，其中附属设备约占工程费总概算的百分之四十二以上，这是一个很大的浪费，降低了国家投资的效用。同时，铁路专用线不能直达仓库，今后物资运输费用也会发生浪费。东北人民政府财政部派人查明上项情形后，已责令主办人员进行检讨，并拟给予适当处分。
    （编者按：不作精密设计，不管后果如何，就冒然施工，这是供给制思想在修建工作方面的反映。它不但会浪费国家巨量的人力物力而且会影响国家基本建设的进行，是极有害的。希望目前正在进行修建工作的部门，都像东北财政部一样来仔细检查一下。如有类似情况，必须迅速改进。）
