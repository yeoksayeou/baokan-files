　　Krupskaya on Children's Health Issues
　　Translated by Xi Menzonghua
　　Editor's Note: This speech by Krupskaya was published in the 1926 Moscow edition of "Essays by Lenin's Wife - On the Children's Movement." The arguments in this speech are still of great educational significance to our children's education work today. We are therefore publishing it here in translation.
　　...The meeting we are holding now is actually a meeting to discuss how to improve children's health and how to consolidate the strength of our children. Our children, in their most tender infancy, experienced much poverty in 1918, 1919, and 1920. Therefore, the physique of our children from the ages of eight to twelve has been devastated by civil war and famine. In order to cultivate a new generation, we should pay special attention to and take special care of the health of our children...
　　This meeting is the beginning of the movement to improve children's health launched by the Social Education Department. The Social Education Department has no doubt that this endeavor will receive assistance from the People's Commissariat for Health, the Public Dining Hall Trade Union, the Society of Friends of Children, and other groups and organizations. At the same time, all organized residents will also participate in helping. And the students themselves, under the leadership of the Young Pioneer captains, must personally participate in this endeavor.
　　The first thing the Social Education Department must do is to publicize the basic principles of physical education.
　　Publicity work must be done in both cities and villages. In the publicity, do not talk about things that are out of reach, such as installing showers and other things in houses, but pay attention to what can be done, and pay attention to the work that can be done in our simple buildings and houses, and in our backward rural conditions. Publicity should be carried out in both words and deeds.
　　Once, I told Lenin about the work being promoted by the first experimental station for rural student physical education in the Garuk Province by the People's Commissariat of Education (at that time, this experimental station was only a preliminary attempt, but now its work has been promoted very widely). He said, "This is real business, not empty talk." Later, he smiled and said to Zetkin about a child's letter to him: "The children wrote to me that all they hope is to be able to take a bath every day and wash their hands before meals - now that we have won, can't we guarantee these?"
　　The People's Commissariat of Education and the People's Commissariat of Health have not yet fought for the health of children - for a healthy Russia. The People's Commissariat of Education should certainly do more to turn Russia into a cultural country, but it cannot ignore the matter of health.
　　The issue of children's health is not about games or excursions, etc., but about caring for children's sleep and rest, about diet, fresh air, bathing, and other very common things, but they are very important for the happiness and development of our children. We are materialists, so we understand that the body and mind are inseparable, or, in the old saying, "a healthy mind resides in a healthy body."
　　We are doing a very poor job with the "physical health" aspect. Some Young Pioneers from the Kostroma area came to see me, and they were all pale. I said to them, "Children, how come you haven't even fulfilled the first article of the Young Pioneer regulations? The regulations say: 'Young Pioneers should have rosy cheeks,' is it because your life is not good?" They said: "No, life is pretty good. It's just that our 'personal' gymnastics have been canceled because they are too difficult to do." The children were somewhat skeptical as to whether Young Pioneers should first have rosy cheeks, and they were even more completely at a loss as to how to achieve this.
　　Publicizing some of the most basic principles of physical education is necessary for children, teachers, kindergartens, women's departments, and every social worker. They should all know how to get children to have rosy cheeks.
　　Efforts should be made to organize doctors, children, teachers, representatives from district schools, relevant government departments, and women's departments to hold discussions.
　　At present, the most important thing is not to come up with many new insights into physical education, but to understand what needs to be done, and then organize and carry out a systematic and general work to improve children's health...
　　I sincerely hope that this meeting on children's physical education will become the first swallow of spring in the broad social movement to improve children's health.

### 克鲁普斯卡娅论儿童健康问题

　　克鲁普斯卡娅论儿童健康问题
    西门宗华译
    编者按：克鲁普斯卡娅这篇演讲词发表于一九二六年莫斯科出版的《列宁夫人论文集——论儿童运动》中。这篇演讲词中的论点，直到现在，对于我们的儿童教育工作还有很大的教育意义。特译载于此。
    ……我们现在所举行的这次会议，实际上正是一个讨论如何增强儿童健康和如何使我们儿童的力量巩固起来的会议。我们的儿童，在他们最嫩弱的幼童时期，在一九一八年、一九一九年和一九二○年，体验过了许多穷困。所以，我们自八岁到十二岁的儿童的体格，受到国内战争和饥荒的摧残。为了培养新的一代，我们就应当特别注意和特别照顾我们的儿辈的健康……
    我们这次会议，就是社会教育处所展开的增强儿童健康运动的一个开端。社会教育处决不怀疑，这一事业将获得保健人民委员部、公共食堂职工会、儿童之友社和其他团体及组织的帮助。同时，一切组织起来的居民也会参加帮助。而学生自己，在少先队队长领导下，也得亲身来参加这个事业。
    社会教育部首先要做的，就是要宣传体育的基本道理。
    在都市和乡村中都要做宣传工作。在宣传中不要说得不着边际，尽说些在房子内装淋浴设备和其他种种，而要注意能做得到的事情，注意那些在我们简陋的建筑和住宅、在我们落后的农村条件下所能做到的工作。应该用语言和事业两方面来宣传。
    有一次，我告诉列宁关于教育人民委员部在加鲁克省农村学生体育事业第一实验站所推行的工作（当时这个实验站只是一种初步的尝试，而现在它的工作已经推行得很广泛了。）。他就说：“这才是真正的事业，而不是说空话。”后来他带笑对蔡特金说到有一个孩子给他的信：“孩子们给我写，他们所希望的只是每天能洗澡，在用饭前能洗手——我们既已取得胜利，难道这些还没有把握么？”
    教育人民委员部和保健人民委员部直到现在还没有为儿童的健康——为健康的俄罗斯而斗争。教育人民委员部对于把俄罗斯变为有文化的方面，尽的力量固应较多些，但对于健康这件事也不能置诸脑后。
    关于儿童的健康问题，并不在于游戏，也不在于远足游历等等，而在于关心儿童的睡眠和休息，在于饮食、新鲜空气、沐浴以及其他最平常的，但对于我们儿童的幸福和他们的发育是非常重要的事情。我们是唯物主义者，因此我们懂得身体和精神两者是不可分离的，如果用一句老话来说，就是“健康的精神寓于健康的身体中。”
    对于“身体健康”这一点，我们搞得很不好。曾有过一些高斯特洛姆地方的少先队员来看我，他们全是面色灰白的。我对他们说：“孩子们，你们怎么连少先队的第一条队章都没有做到呢？队章上写着：‘少先队员应该有鲜红的双颊’，是不是你们的生活不好么？”他们说：“不是，生活过的还好。就是我们‘个人的’体操被取消了，因为太难做。”孩子们对于少先队员是不是首先要有鲜红的双颊，还是有些将信将疑，至于怎样来做到这一点，他们更是完全莫知所措了。
    宣传体育的一些最基本的道理，无论对于儿童，对于教师，对于幼稚园，对于妇女部，以及对于每个社会工作者，都是必要的。他们全都应该知道用什么方法让孩子们有鲜红的双颊。
    应该设法组织医生们和儿童，和教师，和各区学校的代表，和政府有关部门，以及和妇女部等举行座谈。
    目前最主要的，倒不在于提出体育方面的多少新的真知灼见来，而最重要的是要了解需要做些什么，然后再去组织，再来进行增强儿童健康的系统的一般工作……
    我极盼望这次关于儿童体育的会议，在增强儿童健康的广大社会运动中，成为春来第一燕。
