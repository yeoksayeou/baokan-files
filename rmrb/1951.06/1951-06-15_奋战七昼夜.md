　　Seven Days and Nights of Hard Fighting
    In mid-May, while the Korean and Chinese People's forces were fiercely annihilating the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) puppet army in the Yangyang area on the east coast, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers fought fiercely with the U.S. invading army's 24th Division for seven days and nights in the northeast of Seoul. The Volunteers, with a small force, bravely and intelligently defeated the invading enemy who possessed a large number of tanks and superior artillery fire.
    At noon on May 14th, more than 300 U.S. troops, in over 20 vehicles, advanced along the highway from Seoul to Chuncheon under the protection of 15 tanks. A platoon of Volunteers lay in ambush in the mountainous area west of Moshiyu Village. When the enemy's motorcade approached, bullets suddenly sprayed out from the mountains and forests on both sides of the highway. The enemy, caught in a dense web of fire, was thrown into chaos. The vehicles were hit and set ablaze. Some of the enemies were killed on the roadside, while others were burned to death in the vehicles. This ambush lasted only a dozen minutes, and the Volunteers killed more than 100 American soldiers. The remaining enemies climbed onto the tanks in panic and fled.
    Under the Volunteers' resistance, it was difficult for the enemy to advance even a single step. The Volunteers used surprise attacks to successively occupy many important heights along the North Han River, repelling the enemy's counterattacks and inflicting heavy casualties. The battle of Wen'an Mountain is an outstanding example of this.
    Wen'an Mountain faces the North Han River and backs onto Moshiyu Village, holding the railway and highway from Seoul to Chuncheon. The U.S. military planted many landmines on the hillside and erected three rows of barbed wire. On the night of May 16th, Zhou Jihong, a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Volunteers, led eleven warriors, quietly bypassed the minefield, passed through the barbed wire, and quickly approached the enemy's bunker. They wiped out the enemy hiding in the bunker in one fell swoop, covering the subsequent troops' occupation of Wen'an Mountain. The warriors knew that the enemy would counterattack at daybreak, so they disregarded their fatigue and rushed to build fortifications. After dawn, the enemy concentrated more than 30 artillery pieces and 12 aircraft to bombard Wen'an Mountain. The warriors had anticipated this move. They calmly calculated in the shelter how to eliminate more enemies and realize their ambition to earn merits. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, machine gunner Zhao Dezhi said to his comrades: "The time to earn merits for the people has come, resolutely annihilate the enemy!" As soon as he finished speaking, enemy infantry charged from all directions. The twelve enemies at the front charged to a place not far from the high ground. Zhao Dezhi swept the five enemies at the front with a burst of machine-gun fire, and then shot down the four who continued to charge upward. The remaining three tried to escape, but were all killed by a grenade thrown by soldier Li Weisheng.
    The enemy's attack continued for two days and nights, and the strength used increased with each attack. But the number of enemy corpses in front of the Volunteers' position also increased. Faced with a superior enemy, each of the Volunteer warriors resisted the enemy as if they were ten men. When the shelter was blown up, they went to the trenches to fight; when the trenches were destroyed, they jumped into craters to fight; even when seriously wounded, they still held their weapons, hid in the cracks of rocks, and continued to shoot at the enemy. Liu Guangyue ran out of bullets, and two enemies pounced on him from the left. He picked up a large rock and threw it at one of them, hitting the guy in the head and sending him rolling down the mountain bleeding. Another enemy took the opportunity to circle around behind him. As soon as Liu Guangyue turned around, he was hugged by the enemy. He pulled out his hands, hugged the enemy as well, and bit the enemy's ear hard with his teeth. The two struggled for a few minutes. At this moment, two more enemies rushed up. Liu Guangyue saw that it was time for him to sacrifice himself for the people. Without hesitation, he hugged the enemy, jumped off a cliff more than ten meters high beside him, and died together with the enemy.
    The seven counterattacks launched by the enemy in two days and nights were all crushed. The Volunteer warriors not only fiercely annihilated the enemy infantry, but also punished the air bandits. Four Mustang fighter planes, which coordinated with the enemy's first counterattack, were shot down by Volunteer machine gunner Kang Wanzhong with fifteen bullets.
    The warriors, fighting with a small force against a large one, stood firm and fought for seven days and nights, killing or wounding more than 1,000 enemies. At dawn on the last day of the battle, news finally came that the brother troops on the eastern front had fiercely annihilated the Li bandit army.

　　奋战七昼夜
    新华社记者　路云
    五月中旬，当朝、中人民部队在东海岸襄阳地区痛歼李承晚伪军的时候，志愿军一部在汉城东北地区与美国侵略军第二十四师奋战七昼夜。志愿军以少量兵力勇敢而机智地战胜了拥有大量坦克和优势炮火的进犯的敌人。
    五月十四日中午，美军三百余人分乘汽车二十余辆，在十五辆坦克掩护之下沿汉城通往春川的公路窜犯。志愿军的一个排埋伏在磨石隅里以西的山区，等敌人的汽车群闯近时，子弹就骤然地从公路两侧山林中喷射出来。陷入密集火网中的敌人顿时乱成一片。汽车被打得烧了起来。车上的敌人有的被打死在道旁，有的就被烧死在车上。这一场伏击战只打了十几分钟，志愿军共打死了一百多个美国兵。残敌慌乱地爬上坦克逃窜了。
    在志愿军的阻击之下，敌人要想前进一步都很困难。志愿军的勇士们又用突袭手段，接连占领了沿北汉江的许多重要高地，击退了敌人的反扑，大量地杀伤了敌人。文案山战斗就是其中一个杰出的范例。
    文案山面临北汉江，背靠磨石隅里，扼住汉城—春川的铁路和公路。美军在山坡上埋下了很多地雷，还架起三道铁丝网。五月十六日夜晚，志愿军某部排长周吉洪带着十一个勇士，悄悄地绕过地雷阵，穿过铁丝网，迅速地摸到敌人地堡跟前，一下子就消灭了龟缩在地堡里的敌人，掩护后续部队攻占了文案山。勇士们知道一天亮敌人就要反扑，于是就不顾疲劳抢筑工事。黎明以后，敌人果然集中了三十多门大炮和十二架飞机猛轰文案山。勇士们早就料到了敌人这一手。他们镇定地在掩蔽部里盘算着怎样更多地消灭敌人，来实现自己的立功计划。炮声一停，机枪手赵德志对他的战友说：“为人民立功的时候到了，坚决消灭敌人！”话刚说完，敌人的步兵就四面冲上来了。最前面的十二个敌人冲到了离高地不远的地方，赵德志的机枪一梭子扫倒了最前面的五个，接着又打倒了继续往上冲的四个。剩下的三个想逃命，被战士李维胜的一颗手榴弹全部炸死。
    敌人的进攻继续了两昼夜，使用的兵力一次比一次增加。可是摆在志愿军阵地前的敌军死尸也愈来愈多。面对着优势的敌人，志愿军勇士们一个个都一以当十地阻击着敌人。掩蔽部被炸塌了，他们便到交通壕里去打；壕沟炸毁了，就跳进弹坑里打；负了重伤，仍然握着武器，隐蔽在石头缝里，继续向敌人射击。刘光跃的子弹打完了，有两个敌人从左面向他扑来。他搬起一块大石头，向其中的一个扔去，打得那个家伙头破血流地滚下山去。另一个敌人却乘隙绕到他的背后，刘光跃刚一回身，就被那个敌人抱住了，他抽出双手，也把敌人抱住，并且用牙齿狠狠地咬住敌人的耳朵，两个人撕打了几分钟。这时又有两个敌人冲上来了。刘光跃看到这是他为人民舍身的时候了，他就毫不犹豫地抱住那个敌人，跳下身旁三丈多高的悬崖，与敌人同归于尽。
    敌人在两昼夜内发起的七次反扑都被打垮了。志愿军勇士们不仅痛歼了敌人的步兵，而且还惩罚了空中强盗。配合敌人第一次反扑的四架野马式飞机，就被志愿军机枪射手康顽忠用十五发子弹打落了一架。
    以寡敌众的勇士们就这样屹立不动地战斗了七昼夜，共杀伤了敌人一千多名。在战斗的最后一天的黎明，终于传来了东线兄弟部队痛歼李匪军的捷报。
