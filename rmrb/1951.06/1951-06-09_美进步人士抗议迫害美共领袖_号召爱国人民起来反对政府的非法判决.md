　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 7th: According to TASS, New York, June 6th, the United States Supreme Court's judgment against eleven leaders of the American Communist Party has provoked extremely fierce protests among American progressives.
　　Progressive Party Chairman Vincent Hallinan and Secretary Baldwin jointly issued a statement condemning the majority of judges on the Supreme Court for disregarding the Constitution and obeying the war hysteria of the Democratic and Republican parties, and called on every American citizen to demand that the President allow the Supreme Court to retry the case. The statement said: "The Progressive Party will do its utmost to fight against the current hysteria and restore the basic rights of all people."
　　American Labor Party Chairman Marcantonio said: "As long as this judgment exists, the thoughts and freedom of the American people will be bound." He pointed out that changing this judgment is not only the responsibility of the American Communist Party, but also the responsibility of Americans of all political beliefs.
　　Civil Rights Congress Secretary and Black leader Patterson said: "The Supreme Court's judgment is the inevitable result of the government's unpopular war plan. Now, any American who loudly opposes the futilely driving of American youth to death in distant lands can be charged with 'incitement to subversion'." He called on every patriotic American to rise up and demand a change in this judgment.
　　Meanwhile, American newspaper reports revealed that the American judicial authorities are further arranging to arrest and persecute more people who oppose imperialist war and fascism. According to reports, New York District Attorney Saypol revealed that the New York Grand Jury is deliberating on a "broad offensive" against "Communists." The judicial authorities will take action in accordance with the Supreme Court's judgment.
　　At the same time, the U.S. military authorities ordered the Lee Seung-man government to promulgate a special decree to prevent desertion incidents in the army. According to this decree, even the younger brother of a deserter, even if he has not reached the age of military service, must be conscripted into the army. American troops, under the command of Van Fleet, are conducting round-the-clock patrols in Daegu, Busan, and other cities, arresting anyone suspected of evading military service and escorting them to special concentration stations on Geoje Island and other islands for military training.

　　美进步人士抗议迫害美共领袖
    号召爱国人民起来反对政府的非法判决
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社纽约六日讯，美国最高法院对美国共产党十一位领袖的判决在美国进步人士中引起了极其猛烈的抗议。
    进步党主席宾逊及书记鲍尔温联合发表声明，谴责最高法院中的多数法官无视宪法而服从民主共和两党的战争歇斯底里，并号召每一个美国公民要求总统让最高法院重新审判这一案件。声明说：“进步党将竭尽全力与目前的歇斯底里斗争，并恢复全体人民的基本权利。”
    美国劳工党主席马肯托尼奥说：“这个判决存在一天，美国人民的思想和自由就一天受到束缚。”他指出，改变这个判决不仅是美国共产党的职责，也是一切政治信仰的美国人民的职责。
    民权保障大会书记、黑人领袖派特逊说：“最高法院的判决是政府的不得人心的战争计划的必然结果。现在对于任何大声疾呼反对在辽远的地方无谓地驱美国青年于死地的美国人，都可以加上一个‘教唆颠覆’的罪名。”他号召每一个爱国的美国人起来要求改变这个判决。
    同时，美国报纸消息透露，美国司法当局正在进一步布置逮捕和迫害更多反对帝国主义战争和法西斯主义的人士。据报载，纽约区检察长赛波尔透露，纽约大陪审团正在会商一个对“共产党人”的“广泛的攻势”。司法当局即将依照最高法院的判决采取行动。
    同时，美军当局命令李承晚政府颁布防止军队逃亡事件的特别法令。根据这个法令，逃亡士兵的弟弟即使没有达到役龄，也必须被征入伍。美国军队奉范佛里特的命令，在大邱、釜山以及其他城市进行昼夜不停的巡逻，逮捕一切有逃避兵役嫌疑的人，把他们押送到巨济岛以及其他海岛上的特别集中站去受军事训练。
