　　National Model Agricultural Laborer Liu Yun
    Reports to Chairman Mao on Improving Technology and Production

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　This year, the farmers in our village are even more earnestly improving agricultural techniques and studying how to improve production, strengthen the country, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the heroic Korean people, fiercely打击 (dǎjī - strike; hit; attack) the American invading bandits.

　　Our village is a fruit-producing village with a total of 150 mu of orchards. Our village's production technology research association (I am the director) leads everyone in learning new methods for managing fruit trees. This spring, after the fruit trees sprouted, we discovered that they were infested with pests. We immediately led all the villagers to try using sprayers to spray DDT to eliminate the pests on the fruit trees. The result was very effective, and all the bugs on the trees died. Everyone saw that this method was very effective. The original three sprayers were not enough, so they collected money to buy four more, bringing the total number of sprayers in the village to seven. In half a month, all 150 mu of orchards in the village were sprayed with DDT. Ma Dong, an old man in our village who is over seventy years old, and who everyone usually says is stubborn, also leaned on his crutches and went to his own orchard to watch the DDT being used to kill the insects. When he saw that there was not a single bug on the fruit trees, he happily said to people, "The new China led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party is really good. In the past, when our fruit trees were infested with bugs, we were anxious but helpless. This year, with the leadership of the model laborers, we learned methods, and there really isn't a single bug on the fruit trees."

　　This year, during the spring plowing and sowing, the whole village implemented warm water seed soaking. The whole village soaked three *shi* five *dou* eight *sheng* of sorghum seeds, ten *shi* zero *dou* one *sheng* of millet seeds, and one *shi* four *dou* seven *sheng* of glutinous millet seeds. At first, the villagers were worried that they would not do it well. According to the methods I learned at the National Model Workers Representative Conference, I used a thermometer to measure the temperature, first using 58-degree warm water to soak the millet seeds, and then using 55-degree warm water to soak the glutinous millet seeds, and I did germination tests. Only then did the villagers believe that seed soaking was a good method. Everyone followed suit and soaked the seeds. All one hundred and forty-six households in the village have established seed retention plots, implementing seed retention and seed selection. We have also made a pact to ensure that thirty-five loads of manure are applied to the seed retention plots, that they are hoed four times, and that the rows are wide, the seedlings are sparse, and there are no weeds, to prevent pests and diseases, so that good varieties can be fully adopted within five years. Respected Chairman Mao, we know that the worker elder brothers in various places are working hard to improve technology, increase production, and carry out patriotic bumper harvest competitions. We must also learn from the worker elder brothers, study scientific methods of planting crops, grow more grain, and contribute to our beloved country.

　　全国农业劳动模范刘云
    向毛主席报告提高技术改进生产情形敬爱的毛主席：
    今年，咱们村的农民都更加认真地提高农业技术，研究如何把生产搞好，充实国家力量，支援中国人民志愿军和英勇的朝鲜人民，狠狠地打击美国侵略强盗。
    我们村是一个产果木的村子，全村共有果树园一百五十亩。我们村生产技术研究会（我是主任）就领导大家学习新的方法，管理果树。今春，在果树发了芽以后，就发现树上生了害虫，我们即带领全村农民试用喷雾器喷洒滴滴涕药剂，来消灭果树上的害虫，结果非常灵验，树上的虫全死光了。大家见到这办法很顶事，原有的三架喷雾器不够用，就集了钱买了四架，全村现在共有七架喷雾器。半月的时间，全村一百五十亩果园都喷洒了滴滴涕。我村七十多岁的马洞老汉，平时大家都说他顽固，这回他也拄着拐杖到自己园子里看着用滴滴涕灭虫的情形，他看见果树上一个虫子也没有了，他就高兴地向人说：“毛主席共产党领导的新中国真是好，过去咱们的果树上生了虫，干着急没办法，今年有劳动模范领导咱学办法，果树上真的连一个虫子也没有了。”
    今年春耕播种，全村都实行温水浸种。全村浸高粱种三石五斗八升，浸谷种十石零三斗一升，浸黍种一石四斗七升。起初，老乡们都担心搞不好，我根据在劳动模范代表大会时所学的办法，用温度表测量，先用五十八度的温水浸了谷种，又用了五十五度温水浸了黍种，并作了发芽试验，这时全村老乡才相信浸种是好办法。大家全跟着作了浸种。全村已有一百四十六户建立了留种地，实行留种、选种。我们大家还订了公约，保证在留种地内上粪三十五驮，锄四遍，并做到行宽苗稀，没有杂苗，防止病虫害，以便在五年内全部采用良种。敬爱的毛主席，我们知道各地的工人老大哥都在努力提高技术，增加生产，开展爱国丰产竞赛。我们也要向工人老大哥学习，研究用科学的方法种庄稼，多打粮食，供献给我们可爱的国家。
