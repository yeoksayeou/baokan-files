　　Thanking the Party for its Nurturing and Education
    ——Letter from Yue Qingquan, Carpenter at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    On July 1st, our Party will have been established for a full thirty years. In these thirty years of revolutionary struggle, countless excellent and most admirable martyrs sacrificed themselves so that we could have the freedom and happiness we have today. Now that we have freedom and happiness, we must always remember the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution. All of the Party's policies are designed for the benefit of us workers. Comrade Zhao Zhankui said, "The Party is even closer than our own mothers," and this is absolutely true. The Party not only points out the direction of the revolution for our working class, but also continuously helps to train workers with low levels of education to become outstanding revolutionary cadres. Take myself, for example. I am a worker with less than three years of elementary school education. Under the Party's cultivation and assistance, my political understanding and ability to analyze problems have improved immensely. My cultural level, skills, and professional work have all improved a great deal. I am truly grateful to the Party beyond measure.
    I started learning carpentry at the Yuanxing Wood Factory in Nanchizi, Beijing, at the age of fourteen. After completing my four-year apprenticeship, I did odd jobs as a carpenter all over Beijing. I am thirty-one years old this year. From apprenticeship to now, it has been seventeen years. In these seventeen years, I have never been separated from axe handles, wood shavings, and sawdust. I have worked as a carpenter in many places. In March 1949, I went to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory as a temporary carpenter. At that time, the main task was to repair the broken windows and doors of the factory buildings and dormitories that had been destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit army. There were fewer than one hundred workers in the entire factory. Later, the superiors saw that I was doing a good job, and in May I was promoted to a permanent worker. Later, I was elected as a group leader by my fellow workers. Around February 1950, our factory's Party branch was publicly established, and I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In April, the carpenters in our factory were divided into two sections: one was the carpentry workshop of the manufacturing section, which specialized in making farm tools, and the other was the construction team of the general affairs section, which specialized in making wooden furniture, building houses, and repairing doors and windows. When we were first divided, I worked in the carpentry workshop of the manufacturing section. In September, I was transferred by the superiors to the woodworking room of the construction team of the general affairs section to lead the work. I am a careless person who doesn't like to talk and doesn't know how to talk. Under the Party's nurturing and education, I have been able to receive the help and support of the masses wherever I work; in this regard, the Party's help has been invaluable. Our Party members all unite and help each other with our class brothers, criticize each other face to face, and never sow discord or take advantage of the situation for personal gain. In this regard, I love the Party beyond description. We should all accept the Party's education well. Especially we new Party members, who have not been tempered or tested, should study with even greater dedication.
    I will now talk about the current situation of our factory: When our factory was first taken over, the factory buildings and dormitories were dilapidated, there were only about sixty workers, the warehouse was empty, and the workers' beds were made of mud. Now, after more than two years, we can produce thousands of horse-drawn plows every month, as well as other new types of farm tools. We have not only repaired the old factory buildings and dormitories, but also built many new factory buildings and dormitories. The number of workers has increased to about six or seven hundred. This is all thanks to our Party. The goal of our revolution is the nationalization of industry and the mechanization of agriculture. Our factory is the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory; from this name, we can see the relationship with the revolution. We must take on the glorious task of agricultural mechanization and complete the working class's plan to lead national construction. I recall that the Party has given me too much cultivation and assistance in the course of my work, my abilities are constantly improving, and my thinking is constantly progressing. My personal contribution to the Party is not much, only to stand firm, not to retreat or waver in any situation, and to work hard!

### 感谢党对我的培养教育——华北农业机械总厂木工岳清泉来信

　　感谢党对我的培养教育
    ——华北农业机械总厂木工岳清泉来信
    到七月一日，我们的党成立整整三十年了。在这三十年的革命斗争当中，不知牺牲了多少最优秀、最可敬爱的先烈，才有今天这样的自由幸福。我们有了自由幸福，永远要想念着为革命牺牲的先烈们。党的一切政策，都是为我们工人着想。赵占魁同志说：“党比母亲还亲”，这话实在不假。党不单给我们工人阶级指出革命前途方向，而且还不断帮助培养文化程度不高的工人成为优秀的革命干部。就拿我个人来说，我是一个上小学不足三年、文化程度不高的工人。在党的培养和帮助下，政治认识和分析问题的能力不知提高了有多少。在文化上、技术上、业务工作上，都提高了很多。我对于党真是感恩不尽。
    我从十四岁在北京城内南池子源兴木厂学木工。四年学满之后，就在北京各处做散工。我今年三十一岁。从学徒到现在十七年。在这十七年当中，我始终没离开过斧把、刨花、锯沫。我在不少处都做过木工活。在一九四九年三月，我到华北农业机械总厂做临时木工。那时主要工作是修理被国民党匪军破坏的场房宿舍破窗破门。全厂工人不足一百名。后来上级看我工作很好，到了五月就提升为正式工人。后来又被工友选为小组长。到一九五零年二月左右，我厂党公开了，成立了支部，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。到了四月，我厂木工分为两部分，一部分是制造科木工场，专做农具。一部分是属总务科修建股、专做木器家俱，建筑房屋、修理门窗零活等。在初分的时候我在制造科木工场工作。到了九月由上级调到总务科修建股木工房领导工作。我是一个粗心大意、不爱说话也不会说的人。在党的培养教育下，使我在何处工作都得到群众的帮助和拥护；在这点上，党给的帮助实在不小。我们党员同志，都对于自己阶级弟兄团结互助，当面批评，决不会挑拨离间，为个人利益趁风使船。在这点上，我对于党不知如何的爱。我们应该好好接受党的教育。尤其是我们新党员，又没经过锻炼，又没经过考验，更应当用心学习。
    我再说说我们厂的目前情况：我们厂在初接管的时候，场房宿舍破烂不堪，工人只六十多名左右，仓库已成空虚，工人的床铺都是用泥土砌成的。到现在，二年多来，每月已能生产数千部马拉犁，还有其他新式农具。不单把旧有场房宿舍修复了，而且又建筑了很多新的场房、宿舍。工人已增加到六、七百人左右。这都是我们党的功劳。我们革命的目的是工业国有化，农业机械化。我们厂是华北农业机械总厂；从这名字上，就能看出与革命的关系来。我们一定要担负起来农业机械化的光荣任务，完成工人阶级领导国家建设的计划。我回想我在工作过程当中党给我的培养帮助太多了，能力随时都在提高，思想随时都在进步。我个人对党的贡献也没多少，只有坚定立场，在任何情况下不退缩，不动摇，好好工作下去！
