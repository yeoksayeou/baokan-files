　　Gan Caihua, Woman Hero of the Huai River Project
       Lu Sheng
    On the thousand-mile long Huai River project front, over 500,000 young and middle-aged women laborers are working as hard as the male laborers.
    On the Huai River levee in the Xiaobengbu district, I saw a young woman leading eighteen women carrying soil and running quickly. They all had white towels with red flowers and green leaves printed on them wrapped around their heads, their pants rolled up to their knees, and they only rested once from dawn to midday, and each person also learned to recognize two new characters during the break. At noon, the team leader blew the rest whistle, but they didn't stop working. A tall woman waved her hand and said, "Come on! Comrades, let's send another load of 'patriotic soil' to the 'Resist America, Aid Korea Pond'!" So the eighteen women all went into a small soil pit next to the soil pond, filled a basket with even more soil than usual, and ran even faster than usual. Several younger women ran ahead to the levee to pour out the soil, then ran back to send a second load. All eighteen people sent another load before returning to the work shed for lunch.
    At noon, I made a special visit to them and learned that the tall woman was Gan Caihua, a special-class Huai River project model worker in Bengbu City. She invited me into the work shed. I began by asking them why they carried two more loads of soil after work. She held a bowl of rice up to me and touched her clothes, saying:
    "Comrade, you see, the state provides us with rice, and the people of the whole country send us clothes. If we don't contribute our strength to the country, what kind of Chinese are we?" They took out their literacy books for me to see. I carefully looked at each book, and each book had the following words written crookedly: "Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. Without a country, there would be no Huai River project. Work hard on the Huai River project to benefit future generations and prosper the country..." They wrote "祖国" (zǔ guó, motherland) as "主国" (zhǔ guó, master country). Gan Caihua explained, "主国 (zhǔ guó) is a country where the people are the masters. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek, the evil landlords, were the masters, and they made us Huai River people suffer!" At this time, they all put down their rice bowls and recalled their past lives. Gan Caihua said, "At that time, in our Badaji Village, there were eighty-some families. Except for the ten or so landlord, bao chief, and jia chief families, all of us had to flee famine and beg for food every year." She pointed to the dozen or so women in the work shed and said, "Comrade, look: she grew up on her mother's back, she grew up in a bamboo basket, she grew up in a wheelbarrow, she became a child bride at thirteen, and she became a child bride at ten. If a child bride is raised in a poor family, the suffering is the same for the whole family; but if she is raised in the home of an evil landlord, she will suffer a death sentence." They said, "The standards set by the landlords and evil gentry for child brides were: not allowed to smile when talking to people, not allowed to be annoyed when scolded by the mother-in-law, had to grind the mill and carry water quickly, had to bind her big feet small, had to respond when the mother-in-law called, not allowed to speak in a loud voice, had to do all the big and small things well, and had to eat less..." At this point, more than a dozen women began to cry. Gan Caihua seemed to remember something important and quickly wiped away her tears, reminding everyone, "Comrades! Why don't you hurry up and feed the children? We'll be going to work in a while!" At this time, I realized that half of these dozen or so women had brought their children to the levee. Gan Caihua continued, "After liberation, Chairman Mao came, and the people became the masters of the country. Our suffering finally came to an end. Take raising children, for example. In the past, when a child was born, we had to carry it on our backs and flee famine everywhere. Now when we come to the levee, the government has set up a temporary nursery for us. The children can play and jump in the room and no longer grow up on their mother's backs. We can take advantage of the rest time during the day to feed the children twice, and at night we can caress the children's bottoms and sleep. Male laborers can rest at noon, but we still have to feed the children; male laborers can sleep soundly at night, but we have to carefully raise the children and feed them. Although we are a little tired, we are very happy. We all realize that repairing the Huai River is to benefit future generations and prosper the country; and raising children is to cultivate the future masters of the country, for the motherland is for ourselves. Thinking of this, we don't feel tired."
    Then she told me about their achievements in winter repairs and spring plowing. During the winter repairs, taking soil within 300 meters, their entire team averaged 4.7 cubic meters of soil dug per person per day, which was the highest record for women digging soil during the winter repairs. The Huai River Project Committee awarded her team a red flag of "Women Heroes." During the spring repairs, taking soil within 400 meters, in addition to digging 4.72 cubic meters of soil per person per day, in order to express support for the Korean front, they also dug an extra three cubic meters of soil per person. They said, "Without the Volunteers fighting in Korea, we would not be able to harness the Huai River, let alone raise our children in peace."

　　治淮女英雄甘彩华
       鲁生
    在千里治淮战线上，五十多万青壮年劳动妇女，也和男民工一样紧张地劳动着。
    在小蚌埠区的淮河大堤上，我见到一个青年妇女领着十八个妇女抬着土飞跑。她们全用印有红花绿叶的白毛巾裹着头，裤子卷在膝盖上，从黎明到晌午中间只休息过一次，每人还在休息中认会了两个生字。晌午，中队长吹了休息哨，她们还不停工。一个高大个子的妇女挥着手说：“来！同志们，到‘抗美援朝塘’再送一次‘爱国土’！”于是十八个妇女都进到土塘旁的一个小土塘里，盛着比平时更满的一大筐土，跑的也比平时更快。几个更年青的妇女先跑到堤上倒下土，又跑着返回来送第二次。十八个人全又送了一次，才回到工棚里吃午饭。
    中午，我特地去访问她们，才知道那又高又大的妇女就是蚌埠市特等治淮模范甘彩华。她让我到工棚里，我开始就先问她们为什么收工了还要再抬两次土？她把一碗大米饭端到我眼前，又摸着她身上的衣服说：
    “同志，你看，国家供给俺们大米，全国人民又送俺们衣服，俺们要不给国家拿出点力量来，那还算什么中国人？”她们拿出她们的识字本来给我看。我细细看了每一个本子，每个本子上都歪歪扭扭写着：“抗美援朝，保家卫国，没有主国，就不会治淮河，努力治淮，造福子孙，繁荣国家……”等许多字儿。她们把“祖国”写成了“主国”。甘彩华解释说：“主国就是人民当了主人的国家。从前蒋介石恶霸地主当主人，可把俺们淮河老百姓治苦了！”这时她们都放下饭碗回忆起过去的生活来。甘彩华说：“那时俺们八大集村八十多家，除过地主、保长、甲长十多家外，俺们大家年年都得逃荒要饭吃。”她指着工棚里的十多个妇女说：“同志你看：她是在她娘背上长大的，她是在竹篓里长大的，她是在小车上长大的，她十三岁就当童养媳，她十岁就是童养媳。童养媳要是童养到穷人家，受苦受罪全家都一样；要是童养到恶霸地主家，可就受死罪了。”她们说：“地主恶霸给童养媳规定的标准是：和人说话不准笑，婆婆骂时不烦恼，推磨挑水要快跑，两只大脚要缠小，婆婆叫时要应到，说话不准声音高，大小事儿全做好，吃饭还要吃得少……”说到这里，十多个妇女都哭了起来。甘彩华好像想起了一件大事，连忙擦干眼泪提醒大家说：“同志们！你们还不赶快给孩子们喂奶吃，一会就要上工了！”这时我才知道她们十多个妇女就有一半都带着小孩来上堤。甘彩华继续说：“解放了，毛主席来了，人民当了国家的主人，俺们大家的苦才算受到头。就说抚养孩子罢，往年生下小孩来，就得背在背上四处逃荒要饭吃，如今俺们上堤来，政府就给俺们专设了一个临时托儿所。孩子可以在房间里跳玩，不再在娘背上生长了。俺们白天可以趁休息时间给孩子们喂两次奶吃，夜里可以抚摸着小孩的屁股睡觉。男民工晌午可以休息，俺们还得喂孩子奶吃；夜里男民工可以放心的睡觉，俺们还得小小心心地抚养孩子吃奶。俺们虽然有些累，但是俺们可非常高兴。俺们都认识了，修淮河是为子孙造福，繁荣国家；俺们抚养孩子又是为了培养国家将来的主人，为祖国也就是为自己。想到这里，俺们就不觉得累了。”
    接着她就把她们冬修春耕的成绩告诉我。冬修中，在三百公尺内取土，她们全班平均每人每天挖到四点七公方土，是冬修中妇女挖土的最高纪录，治淮委员会奖给她班一面“女中英雄”的红旗。春修中，在四百公尺内取土；除每人每天挖四点七二公方土外，为了表示支援朝鲜前线，又每人多挖三公方土。她们说：“没有志愿军在朝鲜作战，俺们就不可能治淮河，更不能安心地抚养孩子。”
