　　(I) The Central Link in Implementing the Three Great Patriotic Emulations
　　The Party organization of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, in implementing the Three Great Patriotic Emulations of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, firmly grasped the central link of revising the patriotic pact. It mobilized the masses to consciously and voluntarily revise those parts of the patriotic pact that lagged behind the masses' political awareness and supplemented new content according to the masses' demands. The result of this approach was the formation of a mass self-education movement, which achieved great success. Many people enthusiastically carried out inspections of the implementation of the patriotic pact in the movement to revise the patriotic pact, engaged in criticism and self-criticism, and then, on the basis of ideological unity, put forward a number of specific methods for increasing production, donating, and supporting the front lines, resulting in many important rationalization proposals and rapidly improving production quality. The patriotic pact had practical and rich content, thus correcting some of the formalistic shortcomings of the past patriotic pacts and becoming a concrete action program for the people to support the government, defend the motherland, and strive for the final victory in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.
　　This approach is correct and can be emulated everywhere. Experience has shown that leading the people to correctly formulate and implement patriotic pacts is a fundamental link in deepening and regularizing the nationwide patriotic upsurge. After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued the Three Great Patriotic Emulations, it was enthusiastically responded to by the people. In order to systematically lead this patriotic movement, all localities should, on the basis of mass revision of patriotic pacts, formulate specific plans for increasing production, donating, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and consciously guide the increasingly high enthusiasm of the masses into longer-term work competitions such as increasing production and donations. Leaders should clearly recognize that only by mobilizing the masses from the bottom up to formulate patriotic pacts can resisting US aggression and aiding Korea become a fundamental driving force for constantly promoting work and raising the political awareness of the masses, and provide a guarantee for the realization of increasing production, donating, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers.
　　(II) Obligatory Labor to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
　　In the new movement to increase production and donations to resist US aggression and aid Korea, countless moving patriotic deeds have emerged, among which the obligatory labor to resist US aggression and aid Korea, which has already begun or is beginning in some institutions, factories, and schools, is particularly worth introducing.
　　Patriotic obligatory labor is a spontaneous creation of the masses in various forms.
　　The faculty, staff, and students of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Beijing University of Technology organized a chemical engineering service group. Some students are preparing to organize surveying teams. They use their spare time to serve various enterprises and donate part or all of the income they earn to the state.
　　Some staff members of the Fifth District Committee of the CCP Beijing formed a "Patriotic Production Increase Group," designating Sundays as "Obligatory Labor Day to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea," and donating all the proceeds to the state. They have already donated the results of their first labor. Now, many people are asking to participate in obligatory labor.
　　Some workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decided to carry out obligatory labor every day, working eight hours on Sundays, and donating all income to the state. There are also many office workers who automatically increase their working hours and stop resting on Sundays to engage in labor to increase production and increase income to support the front lines.
　　The emergence of patriotic obligatory labor to resist US aggression and aid Korea is worthy of attention. It is one of the important forms in which the people's increasingly high patriotic enthusiasm is combined with concrete actions. Relevant departments should earnestly support them, solve their various difficulties, and plan to allocate them various jobs that they can handle. Responsible comrades of factories, schools, and organizations should pay attention to strengthening leadership, encourage everyone's patriotic enthusiasm for engaging in obligatory labor, and at the same time, adhere to the principle of voluntary participation in obligatory labor, pay close attention to not allowing it to affect the masses' physical health and the limits allowed by their work and studies, and encourage everyone to use their brains to combine patriotic obligatory labor with their own business and technology, and come up with various effective methods to benefit the people, improve work, increase production, and donate weapons with the income from labor.

　　短评
    （一）执行三大爱国号召的中心环节
    北京石景山发电厂党组织在贯彻执行中国人民抗美援朝总会三大爱国号召中，紧紧地抓住了修订爱国公约这一中心环节。发动群众自觉自愿地修正爱国公约中某些落后于群众政治觉悟的部分，并按照群众要求补充了新的内容。这样作的结果，形成了群众性的自我教育运动，获得很大成绩。很多人在修订爱国公约的运动中热烈地进行了执行爱国公约的检查，展开批评和自我批评，然后，在思想一致的基础上，提出若干爱国增产捐献支援前线的具体办法，出现了许多重要的合理化建议，使生产质量迅速提高。爱国公约有了实际的丰富的内容，因而也就纠正了过去制订的爱国公约的某些形式主义缺点，成为人民拥护政府，保卫祖国，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利的具体行动纲领。
    这一作法是正确的，各地均可以仿行。经验证明：领导人民群众正确地订立和执行爱国公约，是把全国人民爱国高潮引向深入和经常化的一个基本环节。中国人民抗美援朝总会三大爱国号召发布后，获得人民群众热烈响应。为了系统地领导这一爱国运动，各地应在群众性的修订爱国公约的基础上，制订增产捐献和优待烈属军属等项具体计划，有意识地将群众日益高涨的热情引向增产捐献等较长时期的工作竞赛中去。领导工作者应当清醒地认识：只有由下而上发动群众订出爱国公约才可以使抗美援朝成为经常推动工作提高群众政治觉悟的基本动力。并给增产捐献和优待烈属军属等项工作提供了实现的保证。
            （二）抗美援朝的义务劳动
    在新的抗美援朝增产捐献运动中，出现了无数动人的爱国事迹，其中特别值得介绍的便是在某些机关，工厂，学校已经开始或正在开始的抗美援朝义务劳动。
    爱国义务劳动是以各种形式出现的群众自发的创造。
    北京大学工学院化工系的师生员工组织了一个化工服务组。有的同学准备组织测量队。他们利用课余时间为各种企业服务，将所得收入的一部或全部捐献给国家。
    中共北京五区区委会部分工作人员组成了“爱国增产小组”，定星期日为“抗美援朝义务劳动日”，劳动所得全部捐献给国家。他们已经捐献了第一次劳动成果。现在，有很多人要求参加义务劳动。
    石景山钢铁厂部分工人决定每日实行义务劳动，星期日劳动八小时，全部收入献给国家。还有不少机关工作人员自动增加工作时间，停止星期休息，来从事劳动增产，增加收入支援前线。
    抗美援朝爱国义务劳动的出现，是值得重视的。它是人民日益高涨的爱国主义的热情和具体行动结合的重要形式之一。有关机关应认真予以扶持，解决他们各种困难，有计划地分配给他们各种可以胜任的工作。工厂、学校、机关团体的负责同志应注意加强领导，要鼓励大家从事义务劳动的爱国热情，同时，还要坚持参加义务劳动的自愿原则，十分注意勿使其影响群众的身体健康和工作及课业所能允许的限度，鼓励大家开动脑筋把爱国的义务劳动同自己的业务、技术结合起来，想出各种有效的办法，造福人民，改进工作，增加生产，并以劳动所得来捐献武器。
