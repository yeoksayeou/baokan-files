Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th: British soldiers captured by the Chinese and Korean People's forces have recently received many letters from their families. These letters reveal the growing dissatisfaction among the British people with the British Labour government's continued subservience to the United States in waging a war of aggression in Korea.

　　Campbell received a letter from his father, which said: "America is stirring up a world war,... only those American and some wealthy people here need to make a fortune through war." McNabb's brother said in a letter: "We should not have sent troops there. This war is entirely made by the Americans... The Labour government has made us suffer, selling us out to the Americans." Prescott-Westcar's father wrote: "Our corrupt ministers, although they possess a minority of the people, have lost the respect of most of the country." The letter writers expressed great pleasure that their sons or brothers were treated leniently after being captured by the Chinese and Korean People's forces. McNabb's brother also said: "Now you have the opportunity to understand the truth, you should study hard."

　　英俘家属的信件
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】被中、朝人民部队俘获的英军士兵们最近收到了许多他们的家属写给他们的信。这些信透露了英国人民对于英国工党政府继续屈从美国在朝鲜进行侵略战争，已经日益不满。
    堪普培尔收到他父亲写给他的一封信，信上说：“美国正在掀起世界大战，……只有那般美国的以及我们这里的一些财阀们才需要靠战争来发财。”麦克纳勃的哥哥在信上说：“我们是不应该出兵到那边去的。这战争全是美国人制造的…………。工党政府苦了我们，将我们出卖给美国人了。”普莱斯考特—威斯特卡的父亲来信说：“我们的腐败的部长们虽然拥有少数的人们，但已失去了全国大部分人们的尊敬。”来信者对于他们的儿子或兄弟被中、朝人民部队俘掳以后受到宽大待遇，都表示很高兴。麦克纳勃的哥哥并且说：“现在你有机会可以明了事情的真相了，你应该用心学习。”
