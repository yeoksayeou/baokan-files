A Purely Technical Viewpoint Is Not Enough

The error of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in taking a purely technical viewpoint in the preparatory work for economic accounting has educational significance for the whole country.

Originally, the implementation of the economic accounting system is a fundamental method for managing the people's enterprises well, and it not only conforms to the current interests of the state and the working class, but also conforms to the long-term interests. Therefore, as long as this principle can be clearly explained to the working masses in thought, it will surely be supported by the working masses and consciously promoted.

In the early stage of preparing for economic accounting, the leading cadres of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot did not conduct ideological education on economic accounting among the workers, did not mobilize the masses, and did not inspire the workers to recognize the benefits of implementing economic accounting for the country and the working class. They simply and rashly sent a few standard checkers to the workshop to "check." This turned the implementation of economic accounting into a purely technical task, thinking that a few standard checkers could solve the problem. As a result, the masses not only did not understand the significance of implementing economic accounting and would not consciously participate in this work with the attitude of masters, but also developed erroneous understandings and became opposed to the checkers, hindering the promotion of the economic accounting system.

This involves a fundamental ideological question, that is, must the implementation of economic accounting rely on the working masses, or is it enough to rely on a few personnel engaged in technical work (such as checking standards)? Even with "checking standards," a relatively uncomplicated task, if the standard checkers do not establish the viewpoint of relying on the working masses and do not consult with the working masses before checking working hours and consumption quotas, then the standards they check will not be reasonable and will also arouse dissatisfaction among the working masses. This will also make it impossible to do a good job in preparing for economic accounting.

It is good that the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot was able to discover the above-mentioned deviations in a timely manner and correct them. Party organizations in enterprises in various localities should pay close attention to such issues, correct them in a timely manner, and report the problems found to us at any time.

### 单纯技术观点是不行的

　　单纯技术观点是不行的
    丰台机务段在进行经济核算的准备工作中所犯的单纯技术观点的错误，对于全国都有教育意义。
    本来实行经济核算制，是管好人民企业的基本方法，不仅是符合于国家和工人阶级的目前利益，而且是符合于长远利益的。因此，只要能在思想上对工人群众把这个道理说清楚，就一定能得到工人群众拥护和自觉地推行的。
    丰台机务段的领导干部在进行经济核算的准备工作的初期，没有向工人进行关于经济核算的思想教育，没有把群众发动起来，没有启发工人认识实行经济核算对国家、对工人阶级的好处，只孤立地由几个查标人员冒然地去车间里“查”。这样就把实行经济核算当成单纯的技术性的工作，以为只要几个查标人员就可以解决问题了。这样做的结果，不仅使群众没有了解实行经济核算的意义，不会自觉地以主人翁的态度来参加这一工作；而且使群众发生错误的认识，和查定人员对立起来，阻碍了经济核算制的推行。
    这里涉及一个根本思想问题，即实行经济核算是必须依靠工人群众呢？还是只要依靠几个从事于技术工作的人员（如查定标准）即行呢？即以“查标”这个还比较不太复杂的工作来说，如果查标人员没有树立依靠工人群众的观点，不和工人群众商量，就来查工时，查消费定额，那么他们所查的标准，是不会合理的，而且也会引起工人群众不满。这样也就做不好经济核算的准备工作。
    丰台机务段中国共产党总支委员会能够及时地发现上述偏向，并加以纠正，这是很好的。各地企业党组织都应当密切地注意这一类的问题，及时加以纠正，并将所发现的问题随时报告我们。
