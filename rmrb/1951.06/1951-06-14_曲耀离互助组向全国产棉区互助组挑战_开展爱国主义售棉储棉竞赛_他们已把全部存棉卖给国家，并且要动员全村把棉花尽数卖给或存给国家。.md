　　The Qu Yaoli (formerly mistakenly written as Qu Yaonan) Mutual Aid Team, which set the national record for the highest yield per unit area of cotton fields, responded to the call of the state by selling all its stored cotton to the state and proposed launching a patriotic cotton selling and storing competition to mutual aid teams in national cotton-producing areas.

　　After Qu Yaoli saw the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchasing and storing work, he immediately convened a meeting of the entire mutual aid team, mobilizing everyone to realize the principle of loving the motherland in the patriotic pact with concrete actions, which was supported by the entire team. The team is made up of old cotton farmers. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, growing cotton not only did not lead to prosperity, but also suffered various blows. After liberation, the People's Government implemented a series of policies to protect cotton farmers, which not only changed the past tragic situation of cotton farming leading to bankruptcy, but also enabled cotton farmers to become prosperous. For example, Qu Yaoli and Gao Jindong planted sixteen and a half mu of cotton last year, and after harvesting the cotton, the state helped them exchange it for one hundred and sixteen dan of grain. The income from growing cotton was more than 150 percent higher than the income from growing grain. When this mutual aid team planted cotton, they also borrowed waterwheels from the state, making 84 percent of the entire mutual aid team's 43 mu of cotton fields into paddy fields. These personal experiences have inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of every cotton farmer. In addition to selling all 200 jin of raw cotton he had stored to the state, Qu Yaoli also convened a family meeting, mobilizing his wife, sister-in-law, and daughter-in-law to sell their stored cotton to the state as well. In addition to voluntarily taking out cotton or mobilizing their families to sell cotton, the mutual aid team members also went to various farmers to carry out publicity. For example, Qu Youyi alone publicized to more than ten households. Driven by Qu Yaoli's team, cotton farmers in the entire village sold their stored cotton one after another.

　　In just one day, more than ten cotton farmers sold more than 940 jin of stored cotton. Currently, the cotton selling and storing campaign in the village is being successfully launched.

　　The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team also challenged mutual aid teams in national cotton-producing areas, proposing that in addition to selling all stored cotton to the state, they should also launch a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign among cotton farmers in the entire village, selling or storing all the cotton in the village to the state.

　　Note: Qu Yaoli is from Quzhuangtou, Jiexian County (cotton-producing area), Shanxi Province. Last year, he harvested 745 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field, setting the national record for the highest yield per unit area of cotton field, 137 jin more than the highest record in North China (608 jin) created by Handan Farm. The Yuncheng Commissioner's Office of the People's Government of Shanxi Province therefore awarded him the honorary title of "Labor Model." (Xinhua News Agency)

　  开展爱国主义售棉储棉竞赛        
    他们已把全部存棉卖给国家，并且要动员全村把棉花尽数卖给或存给国家。
    创全国棉田单位面积产量最高纪录的曲耀离（前误为曲耀南）所领导的互助组，响应国家号召，以全部存棉卖给国家，并向全国棉产区互助组提出展开爱国主义的售棉储棉竞赛。
    曲耀离看到中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，立即召开全互助组会议，动员大家以具体行动实现爱国公约中热爱祖国的一条，得到全组的拥护。该组都是老棉农，在日寇、阎匪统治时，种棉不但不能发家，还遭受了种种打击。解放以后，人民政府进行了一系列的保护棉农的政策，不仅改变了过去种棉破产的悲惨情况，而且使棉农发了家。如曲耀离、高进东两人去年种棉十六亩半，收棉后，国家帮助他们换到粮食一百一十六石，种棉收入较种粮食收入多过百分之一百五十。他们这个互助组种棉时并从国家贷到水车，使全互助组的四十三亩棉田的百分之八十四变为水田。这些切身体验激发了每个棉农的爱国热情。曲耀离除将自己所存的二百斤原棉扫数售给国家外，并召开家庭会议，动员他的妻子、弟媳、儿媳将存棉也卖给国家。互助组员们除了自动拿出棉花或动员家庭卖棉外，还分别到各农户进行宣传。如曲有义一个人就宣传了十多户。在曲耀离组的推动下，全村棉农纷纷售出存棉。
    在一天里面，仅十多户棉农就售出存棉九百四十多斤。现该村的售棉储棉运动正在顺利展开中。
    曲耀离互助组并向全国棉产区互助组挑战，提出除将全部存棉卖给国家外，还要开展全村棉农的爱国售棉存棉运动，把全村的棉花尽数卖给或存给国家。
    按：曲耀离是山西省解县（棉产区）曲庄头人。去年他每亩棉田收获籽棉七百四十五斤，创全国棉田单位面积产量最高纪录，比邯郸农场创造的华北最高纪录（六百零八斤）多一百三十七斤，山西省人民政府运城专员公署因此特授予“劳动模范”的光荣称号。（新华社）
