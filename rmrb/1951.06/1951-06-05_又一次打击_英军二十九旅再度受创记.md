Another Blow
— A Record of the British 29th Brigade Suffering More Losses

Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporters and Correspondents Collective Creation

In the recent powerful counter-offensive launched by the Chinese and Korean People's forces, more than 4,000 men of the British auxiliary army 29th Brigade were annihilated, and one lieutenant colonel regimental commander, three majors, and twenty-one lieutenant-level officers were captured.

Prior to this, during the New Year offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, a heavy tank battalion of the brigade was annihilated because it was ordered by the American commander to cover the retreat of the American army in the direction of Uijeongbu. This time, in order to block the counter-offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, the brigade was again ordered by the American commander to attempt to hold the position south of the Imjin River northwest of Uijeongbu. However, due to the rapid collapse of the American 3rd Division on its left flank, the brigade was ambushed and encircled by the Chinese People's Volunteers. Private Cass of the Royal Ulster Rifles, who was captured, said: "We all hate the Americans because they put us in the most dangerous places when a battle starts."

This time, the "Gloucestershire Regiment," an infantry regiment of the British 29th Brigade, suffered the heaviest losses. The story of how this regiment was severely crushed is as follows:

On the night of April 22, the Chinese and Korean People's forces rapidly broke through the Imjin River. A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers valiantly attacked and advanced towards the British 29th Brigade in front of them. Tao Yongheng, the platoon leader of a certain unit's assault platoon, with two squads, and with the support of friendly forces, captured the strategically important 257 Height held by a British company in just five minutes. Another unit thrust into the 147 Height located ten *li* south of the river. An American battalion was stationed there. After four fierce battles, the Chinese People's Volunteers captured the height and began to pursue the fleeing enemy. After dawn, the enemy, under the cover of superior artillery fire, launched a counterattack against the Chinese People's Volunteers who had captured the bridgehead positions. The brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed their determination to "not give up an inch of land, resolutely advance, and eliminate the enemy!" Gong Delin, the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, with two squads, repelled six enemy counterattacks at one position. They first launched an attack, defeating an enemy reconnaissance team and capturing seven British soldiers alive. Then, the enemy launched a series of counterattacks, with the number of enemy soldiers increasing from twenty to more than one hundred, and the number of tanks increasing from twenty to more than thirty. Wu, the wounded deputy platoon leader, said to his comrades: "We are the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, and we must not disgrace our motherland!" His comrades replied loudly: "Resolutely eliminate the enemy and make contributions to the people of the world!" After two hours of fighting, they finally completely defeated the enemy's six counterattacks. He Shirong, a light machine gunner and member of the New Democratic Youth League, held a hilltop with a light machine gun for five hours, repelling two assaults by a British company and killing or wounding more than sixty enemies.

Simultaneously with the fierce attack on the bridgehead positions, the Chinese People's Volunteers carried out a courageous insertion into the enemy's flanks and rear. After breaking through the Imjin River at 8:00 PM, a unit reached the foot of Mt. Kunjung, located 30 *li* from the river along the highway from Pyongyang to Seoul, by 10:30 PM. After midnight at 3:30 AM, the unit occupied the main peak, located 10 *li* from the foot of the mountain. The defending enemy company fled in panic. In this way, the Chinese People's Volunteers cut off the retreat of about two battalions of the British army.

On April 24, various units of the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a battle to divide and encircle the infantry regiment of the British 29th Brigade in the area around Mt. Kunjung. The brave soldiers who occupied Mt. Kunjung at night, while friendly forces rushed south, used a platoon to rush up a ten-*li* mountain ridge and intercept the enemy from behind. They captured four tanks in the ravines, destroyed seven ammunition trucks, and blocked many cars coming from the north and going to the south. A certain company instructor of the Chinese People's Volunteers led a platoon to disrupt the enemy's artillery positions, effectively supporting the main force attacking from the front. An enemy battalion guarded the Snow Horse Village position at the western corner of Mt. Kunjung, stubbornly resisting under the cover of aircraft and artillery. The brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers continuously occupied three hilltops. When they concentrated their firepower to attack the last hilltop, a white flag was waved on the hilltop. The brave soldiers climbed up the mountain, and more than one hundred British soldiers were already standing at attention with their hands raised, waiting to be captured. More than two hundred enemies on the front slope refused to surrender and fled down the ravines. Wang Fengshan, the instructor of a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led more than twenty people to chase them down. He shot down an enemy, and immediately two enemies knelt down. Instructor Wang ordered them to call out to the enemies in front. A prisoner asked in broken Chinese: "Lenient treatment for prisoners?" Instructor Wang nodded. The British soldier shouted to his companions. One shouted to another, and before long, these British soldiers all returned with their hands raised. The mud on their faces was thick. The brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers took them to the river to wash their faces, and they lined up in three columns, happily following the Chinese People's Volunteers escorting them.

On April 25, the British forces began a general retreat. Under the interception and pursuit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the enemy had lost any ability to counterattack and was simply fleeing desperately. People were squeezing people, cars were crashing into cars, and "Royal Tanks" were running over "Royal Wounded Soldiers." To escape quickly, they threw away their weapons, backpacks, and even some small diaries. Some tanks and cars that were blocked on the road did not even turn off the engine, and the engines emitted a buzzing wail.

Under these circumstances, the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers annihilated a British company, while suffering no casualties themselves. Liu Guangtian, a soldier of the Sixth Squad of the company, under the cover of machine gun fire, swept his submachine gun at the waists of the enemies in front, cutting the enemies in half, causing some enemies to run, some to kneel, and some to lie on the ground pretending to be dead. Liu Guangtian waved his hand, and these lost "Royal Army" soldiers staggered over with their hands raised. Liu Guangtian alone captured a full sixty British soldiers.

Karn, the commander of the Gloucestershire Regiment and commander of the direct-controlled battalion, was also captured in this battle. He initially hid in a pile of corpses pretending to be dead. The Chinese People's Volunteers discovered this "dead man" who was breathing rapidly while cleaning the battlefield. He quickly got up and raised his hands. In the panic of battle, he had lost his military cap, which was decorated with "honor" emblems. He was bareheaded and, like other prisoners, devoured the fried noodles given to them by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

### 又一次打击——英军二十九旅再度受创记

　　又一次打击
    ——英军二十九旅再度受创记
    新华社前线记者、通讯员集体创作
    在中、朝人民部队最近发动的强大反击战中，英国帮凶军第二十九旅被歼灭了四千多人，并且有中校团长一名，少校三名和尉级军官二十一名被俘。
    在此以前，在中、朝人民部队的新年攻势中，该旅曾经有一个重坦克营因为奉美国指挥官命令掩护议政府方向的美军撤退而被歼。这一次为了阻击中、朝人民部队的反击，该旅又奉美国指挥官的命令，妄图坚守议政府西北临津江以南的阵地。但由于它左翼美军第三师的迅速崩溃，该旅遂遭到了志愿军的截击和围击。被俘的阿尔斯特来福枪营的普通兵卡斯说：“我们都恨美国人，因为一打起仗来他们就把我们放到最危险的地方。”
    这次英军第二十九旅的步兵团“格罗斯忒郡团”损失最重。这个团遭受痛歼的经过是这样的。
    四月二十二日夜，中、朝人民部队迅速地突破了临津江。志愿军某部奋勇地向当面敌人英军第二十九旅攻击前进。某部突击排排长陶永恒带着两个班，在友邻部队的支援下，仅以五分钟时间就攻占了英军一个连所据守的险要阵地二五七高地。另一支部队直插在江南十里地处的一四七高地。那里有美军一个营据守。经过四次激烈的争夺战后，志愿军攻占了该高地，开始追击溃敌。天明以后，敌人在优势炮火掩护下，向攻占各桥头阵地的志愿军进行反扑。志愿军勇士们表示了“寸土不让，坚决前进，消灭敌人！”的决心。某部副排长宫德林带着两个班，在一处阵地上迎击了敌人六次反扑。他们首先进行出击，击溃了敌人的一支侦察队，活捉七个英国兵。接着，敌人发起了一连串的反扑，敌兵从二十多人增加到一百多人，坦克从二十多辆增加到三十多辆。在战斗中负了伤的吴副排长对他的战友说：“我们是光荣的中国人民志愿军，决不能给祖国丢脸！”他的战友们响亮地回答道：“坚决消灭敌人，为世界人民立功！”经过两小时的战斗，他们终于把敌人的六次反扑完全打垮。另部轻机枪射手新民主主义青年团员何世荣，用一挺轻机枪坚守一个山头达五小时，打垮英军一个连的两次冲锋，杀伤敌人六十多名。
    和猛攻桥头阵地同时，志愿军在敌人侧后进行了勇猛的穿插。某部在晚上八点钟突破临津江以后，十点半钟就插到了离江三十里的位于从平壤到汉城的公路旁的绀岳山脚。午夜以后三点半钟，该部即占领了离山脚有十里路的主峰。守敌一个连仓惶逃遁。这样，志愿军就截断了英军约两个营的退路。
    四月二十四日，志愿军各路部队在绀岳山周围地区展开了分割围歼英军第二十九旅步兵团的战斗。夜间攻占了绀岳山的勇士们，在友军奔杀南下时，以一个排的兵力扑上十里山岗，从背后截击敌人。他们在山沟中俘获了四辆坦克，击毁了七辆弹药车，堵住南来北往的许多汽车。另部志愿军某连指导员带着一个排打乱了敌人的炮兵阵地，有力地支援了从正面进攻的主力。敌人的一个营守着绀岳山西角下雪马里阵地，在飞机大炮掩护下进行顽抗。志愿军勇士们连续地攻占了三个山头，当他们集中火力猛攻最后一个山头时，山头上就摇起了白旗。勇士们爬上山去，一百多个英国兵已经高举双手，立正站着，等候被俘。在山前坡的两百多敌人拒绝投降，纷纷向山沟下逃命。志愿军某连指导员王风山带着二十多个人追了下去。他一枪打倒了一个敌人，马上有两个敌人跪了下来。王指导员命令他们喊住前面的敌人。有一个俘虏用生硬的中国话问道：“宽待俘虏？”王指导员点了点头。这个英国兵就向他的同伴叫嚷起来。一个喊一个，不大一会，这些英国兵都举着手回来了。他们脸上的泥土很厚。志愿军勇士们带着他们到河边洗了脸，他们就排成三路纵队，跟着志愿军的押俘人员高兴地走去。
    四月二十五日，各路英军开始总退却。在志愿军截击和追击下，敌人已失去任何反击的能力，只是拚命地逃。人挤人，车撞车，“皇家坦克”从“皇家伤兵”身上辗过去。为了逃得快，他们扔下了武器、背包，甚至一些小日记本都扔掉了。一些堵塞在路上的坦克、汽车，连油门都没有关，引擎发着嗡嗡的哀叫声。
    在这种情况下，志愿军某部第二连歼灭了英军一个连，而自己却毫无伤亡。该连第六班的战士刘光天，在机枪火力掩护下，提着冲锋枪朝着正面敌人腰部猛扫，把敌人打成两半截，打得敌人有跑的，有跪的，有躺在地下装死的。刘光天把手一招，这些失魂落魄的“皇家陆军”都踉踉跄跄地举着手走过来。刘光天一个人就俘掳了整整六十个英国兵。
    格罗斯忒郡团团长兼直属营营长卡恩也在这次战斗中当了俘虏。他起先藏在一堆死尸中装死。志愿军打扫战场时发现了这个呼吸急促的“死人”。他迅速地爬起来，举起手。他在战斗中惊慌得把缀有“荣誉”帽徽的军帽都丢失了。他光着脑袋，和其他俘虏一样，狼吞虎咽地吃着志愿军发给他们吃的炒面。
