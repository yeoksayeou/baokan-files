	The Best Way to Donate is to Increase Production
	All Workers of No. 3 Well of Xiaobeishan Mine in Jingxi Decide:
	Each Group Will Produce One More Can of Coal Per Day to Buy a Tank in a Year
Editor:
	The entire workforce of the No. 3 Well at the Xiaobeishan Mine in the Jingxi Mining Area of Beijing are enthusiastically responding to the call of the China Peace Committee to donate airplanes and artillery. They proposed that each group should produce one more can of coal each day and donate the resulting wages, planning to donate a tank in 1951. I think that this method of increasing production and income to make patriotic donations should be promoted and popularized among workers, peasants, and other laborers. I also hope that coal miners across the country will be the first to respond to the actions of the entire workforce of the No. 3 Well at the Xiaobeishan Mine and formulate patriotic production increase and donation methods based on their specific circumstances.
	After listening to the report from the comrades of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea on May 31st, the employees of our Jingxi Mining Area in Beijing immediately launched a campaign to donate airplanes and artillery. The patriotic enthusiasm of the employees is very high. Some groups have proposed to save part of their cigarette money to donate. The employees of Jingde Kiln and Tongde Kiln donated all of their bonuses of 1.6 million yuan. Zhao Laodian, an old worker in the boiler room, donated all of his savings of 120,000 yuan to the state, saying, "Our volunteers are working hard at the front, risking their lives for us, we must do our best to donate." Many employees were very moved by Zhao Laodian's words. Therefore, the Mentougou Electrical and Mechanical Plant alone received more than 2 million yuan in cash in one day.
	However, as workers, I think the best way to donate is to increase production and donate the income from increased production to buy airplanes and artillery. If we mobilize workers and farmers across the country to donate by increasing production, the power will be infinite!

	Workers of Datong Coal Mine, Chahar
	Further Develop Patriotic Production Competition After Listening to the Report of Returned Volunteer Army Representatives
Editor:
	The workers of the Datong Coal Mine in Chahar listened to the report of the volunteer army representatives at the welcome conference for returned volunteer army representatives held in Datong City on May 15th. The spirit and glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in bravely fighting deeply moved everyone. The workers were filled with unparalleled anger and hatred when they heard the volunteer army representatives talk about the American aggressors' brutal acts in Korea, such as slaughtering people and raping women. Everyone is determined to further develop the labor competition, produce more coal for the country, and increase national defense capabilities. Yang Zhanshan and Liu Jingxian, two groups in the mine's third mining area, took action first. The day after listening to the report, Yang Zhanshan's group produced 348 carts of coal in one shift, more than double the original quota (170 carts) after the hard work of all the workers in the group. After listening to the report, the members of Liu Jingxian's group returned to the mine and held a group meeting, and everyone expressed their determination to increase production. On the night shift that day, they produced 240 carts of coal, an increase of 50% over the original quota (160 carts).
	The mine has now notified the entire mine of the achievements of the Yang Zhanshan and Liu Jingxian groups as examples for everyone to learn from.

	Donating Airplanes and Artillery to Support the Front Lines is to Defend Our Happy Life
Editor:
	On the evening of May 30th, I participated in the Capital People's Welcome Delegation to Korea Conference. The responsible comrades of the delegation vividly reported the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side against the American aggressor army, and conveyed the love of the beloved Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the motherland. I was very moved after listening.
	The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting the enemy with superior equipment on the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to defend the happy life of the people of the motherland. Every Chinese person feels the happiness of today's life. Every Chinese person knows that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting the American aggressor army on the Korean battlefield, unafraid of sacrifice and bloodshed, in order to defend our happy life. Now, according to the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army needs more airplanes, tanks, artillery, etc., to more forcefully strike the enemy and achieve the final victory of the war as soon as possible. Every Chinese person should actively donate money to buy airplanes and artillery in order to defend our happiness and consciously support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
	I want to save a part of my money as a donation to buy airplanes, tanks, and artillery for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. I also hope that the people of the whole country will immediately and universally launch a patriotic movement to donate airplanes, tanks, and artillery.

	The People of the Whole Country Contributing Money and Efforts to Support the Front Lines is the Great Force for Defending World Peace
Editor:
	We are a group of working people with iron capstans outside Chongwenmen in Beijing. We saw in the People's Daily that Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, said in response to a reporter from the New China News Agency that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is fighting heroically on the front lines in Korea, needs more airplanes, tanks, artillery, etc., to more forcefully strike the enemy and win the final victory of the war as soon as possible. The people of the whole country should contribute their strength to show our determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and support the People's Volunteer Army. We are willing to contribute our meager strength. We are now sending 55,000 yuan (RMB) of our daily savings, as a donation to buy airplanes and artillery for the volunteer army. Our strength is small, but the unanimous response of the people of the whole country to the call of the China Peace Committee and the enthusiastic donations are a great force to combat U.S. imperialism and defend world peace!

	Overseas Chinese in Indonesia Donate Money to Support the Volunteer Army
	Reader Xin Fukang Suggests Returned Overseas Chinese to Promote Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Relatives and Friends Abroad
Editor:
	I am an overseas Chinese who returned from Java. Since the China Peace Committee issued the call to "educate every place and every person in the country with patriotic education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea" and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League called on every Youth League member to do a good job in promoting the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in addition to participating in various propaganda activities in the school, I also used every opportunity to write letters to my relatives and friends in Java to promote the campaign. My aunt Huang Shuhua is a teacher at Bacheng Middle School in Java. I have written her four long letters to promote the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, telling her many heroic deeds of the volunteer army, and sending her many books and newspapers about the campaign. In the letter, I specifically asked her to find ways to promote the campaign to her relatives, friends, and students.
	This work has already achieved preliminary results. On May 22nd, I received a letter from my aunt from Java, knowing that she had actively promoted the campaign to her relatives and friends around her and raised 2 million yuan (RMB) from them, asking me to give it to the China Peace Committee to donate to the People's Volunteer Army soldiers. The letter said: "The brilliant victory and heroic deeds of the volunteer army have greatly encouraged us who are far away overseas. The glory of the motherland is also our glory. We donate these funds to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to express our love and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army."
	This incident shows how much overseas Chinese love the motherland and the People's Volunteer Army comrades and makes me more confident in promoting the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to my relatives and friends overseas. At the same time, I hope that all returned overseas Chinese will use various methods to promote the campaign to overseas Chinese and their relatives and friends.

	Supporting the Volunteer Army and Defending the Motherland is the Glorious Task of the People of the Whole Country
Editor:
	Reading the answer of Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, to a reporter from the New China News Agency, I know that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army needs more modern weapons such as airplanes and tanks and nutritious food in the war with the enemy. I feel that supporting the volunteer army is the glorious duty that every Chinese person should bear. If the Chinese people can enthusiastically donate, accumulate little into much, and buy a large number of airplanes and tanks for the volunteer army comrades, they can eliminate the American aggressor army more quickly. I plan to donate ten catties of millet from my supply every month for the next five months (starting from June) to the volunteer army comrades to buy airplanes, so that they can strike the enemy more forcefully.

	Donate Surplus Living Expenses to Buy Airplanes and Strive for the Final Victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
Editor:
	I am a staff member who has been enjoying supply system treatment for a long time. In February of this year, the treatment for our agency cadres was changed to a low-salary system. In the past few months, in addition to my own and my children's living expenses, I have saved 100,600 yuan, which is deposited in the People's Bank of China.
	On May 30th, I listened to the reports of Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, and was deeply moved. Today, the Chinese people can live happily, which is exchanged for blood and flesh by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades. They are fighting hard with the American aggressor army! We should do our best to support the front lines. I am willing to donate this surplus money to buy airplanes and tanks for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, strengthen their combat power, and advance the final victory of the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

	People of the Whole Country Should Donate Airplanes and Artillery to Enable the Volunteer Army to Annihilate the Enemy More Forcefully
Editor:
	After reading the report of the comrades of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea in the newspaper, I learned that the People's Volunteer Army needs more airplanes and artillery. All of our Chinese people must contribute to donate airplanes, so that the People's Volunteer Army can annihilate the enemy more forcefully. Now I am sending all my savings bonds of 50,000 yuan as a donation for airplanes. Our great motherland has a large population. As long as everyone undertakes such a glorious donation task, contributing money if you have money and contributing efforts if you have efforts, this will form an incomparably huge force.

	American Airplanes Caused My Family to be Destroyed and My Family to be Killed. I Want to Donate Airplanes to Defend the Motherland
Editor:
	The airplanes of American imperialism continue to indiscriminately bomb places such as Andong in our country, causing loss of life and property to our people. Every Chinese person feels incomparable hatred for this shameless act of American imperialism.
	When I saw this news in the newspaper, old and new hatreds flooded into my heart. It was the airplanes of American imperialism that caused my family to be destroyed and my family to be killed. In 1948, the airplanes provided by American imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to slaughter the Chinese people bombed my home; bombed my father and mother to death, and my younger brother and sister were seriously injured. At that time, the dead could not be buried, and the living could not live. Thanks to the People's Government, my younger brother and sister's injuries were healed, so that they could all have jobs. Now, the airplanes of American imperialism have invaded our country's borders and bombed our people again. The people of the whole country must not tolerate it.
	In addition to being determined to do a good job in my current position and resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical actions, I will also donate my savings of pocket money for several months as a donation for airplanes. At the same time, I hope that everyone will respond to this movement, so that we can have more air force to defend the motherland's airspace.

### 增加生产踊跃捐献飞机大炮  支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗

　　增加生产踊跃捐献飞机大炮  支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
    最好的捐献办法是增加生产
    京西小黑山矿三号井全体工人决定
    每组每天多产一罐煤一年买个坦克编辑同志：
    北京市京西矿区小黑山矿三号井的全体工人，热烈响应抗美援朝总会关于捐献飞机大炮的号召。他们提出每小组每天要多出一罐煤，将所得工资捐献出来，计划在一九五一年捐献一辆坦克。我觉得这样以提高生产、增加收入进行爱国捐献的办法，应该在工人、农民及其他劳动人民中提倡推广；我并且希望全国的煤矿工人能首先响应小黑山矿三号井全体工人的行动，也根据自己的具体情况，订出爱国增产捐献的办法。
    我们北京市京西矿区的职工，在五月三十一日听了中国人民赴朝慰问团同志的报告以后，立即展开了捐献飞机大炮运动。职工们的爱国热情是很高的，有的小组提出要节约一部分抽烟的钱，捐献出来；景德窑和同德窑的职工把所得奖金一百六十万元全部捐献；锅炉房老工友赵老殿把平时所积蓄的十二万元全部捐献给国家，他说：“咱们的志愿军在前方千辛万苦，拼死拼活，都是为了咱们，咱们要尽力捐献。很多职工听到赵老殿的话都很感动，所以，单是门头沟机电厂一个单位，一天内就收到现款二百多万元。
    但是，在我们工人来说，我觉得最好的捐献办法还是提高生产，把增加生产的收入献出来买飞机、大炮。如果发动全国的工人和农民用提高生产的办法来捐献，力量是无穷的！

    察哈尔大同煤矿职工
    听了志愿军归国代表报告进一步开展爱国生产竞赛编辑同志：
    察哈尔大同煤矿的职工，在大同市五月十五日举行的欢迎归国志愿军代表大会上，听了志愿军代表的报告。中国人民志愿军英勇作战的精神和光荣战绩，深深感动了大家。工友们听到志愿军代表讲述美国侵略者在朝鲜屠杀人民、强奸妇女等种种耳不忍闻的残暴行为，激起了无比的愤怒和仇恨。大家决心进一步开展劳动竞赛，给国家多生产煤，增加国防力量。该矿第三矿杨占山、刘景贤两个小组首先行动起来。杨占山组在听了报告第二天，经全组工友努力，一班出煤三百四十八车，超过原定额（一百七十车）一倍以上。刘景贤小组的组员听罢报告回到矿上，就开了小组会，人人表示了提高生产的决心。当天晚班，出煤二百四十车，较原定额（一百六十车）提高百分之五十。
    现该矿已把杨占山、刘景贤两小组的成绩通报全矿，作为大家学习的榜样。
                          大同矿区工会
    捐献飞机大炮支援前线就是保卫我们的幸福生活编辑同志：
    五月三十日晚上，我参加了首都各界人民欢迎赴朝慰问团大会。慰问团的负责同志生动地报告了中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战抗击美国侵略军的英勇事迹，传达了可爱的中国人民志愿军对于祖国的热爱。我听后非常感动。
    中国人民志愿军为着保卫祖国人民的幸福生活，正在抗美援朝的最前线上，打击着装备占优势的敌人。每一个中国的人民都感到今天生活的幸福。每一个中国人民都知道：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上不怕牺牲流血，抗击美国侵略军，是为了保卫我们美满的生活。现在，根据中国人民赴朝慰问团了解，中国人民志愿军需要更多的飞机、坦克、大炮等，以更有力地打击敌人，提早取得战争的最后胜利。每一个中国人民，为了要保卫我们的幸福，都应该积极献金购买飞机大炮，自觉地支援中国人民志愿军。
    我要节省一部分钱，作为给中国人民志愿军买飞机、坦克和大炮的捐款。我并希望全国人民立即普遍地展开一个捐献飞机、坦克、大炮的爱国运动。

    全国人民出钱出力支援前线就是保卫世界和平的伟大力量编辑同志：
    我们是北京崇文门外铁辘轳把的一群劳动人民。我们看到人民日报所登中国人民赴朝慰问团廖承志团长答新华社记者问中说：在朝鲜前线英勇作战的中国人民志愿军，需要更多的飞机、坦克、大炮等，更有力地打击敌人，早日获得战争的最后胜利。我们全国人民都应该供献出自己的力量，表示我们抗美援朝的决心，支援人民志愿军。我们愿把微薄的力量供献出来。现将我们十一人一日节余的人民币五万五千元送上，作为给志愿军买飞机大炮的献金。我们的力量很小，但全中国人民一致响应抗美援朝总会的号召，踊跃捐献，就是打击美帝国主义、保卫世界和平的伟大力量！

    印尼华侨捐款支援志愿军
    读者辛赋康建议归国侨胞  向国外亲友宣传抗美援朝编辑同志：
    我是一个爪哇归国华侨。自从抗美援朝总会发出了“使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国主义教育”的号召和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会号召每一个青年团员必须做好抗美援朝的宣传工作以后，我除了参加学校中各种宣传工作以外，还利用每次写信的机会向爪哇的亲友们进行宣传。我的姨母黄淑华是爪哇巴城中学的教师，我先后写了四封长信给她向她宣传抗美援朝的道理，告诉她许多志愿军英勇作战的事迹，并且寄了不少有关抗美援朝的书报给她。在信上我特别要求她设法向她的亲友和学生展开宣传工作。
    这个工作已经有了初步的成果。五月二十二日，我接到姨母从爪哇来信，知道她已积极地向她周围的亲友们进行了宣传，并且向他们募集了人民币二百万元，叫我交给抗美援朝总会捐献给人民志愿军战士。信上说：“志愿军的辉煌胜利和英雄事迹大大鼓舞了远在海外的我们。祖国的光荣，也就是我们的光荣。我们捐献这些款子给中国人民志愿军，表示我们对中国人民志愿军的敬爱。”
    这件事说明了远在海外的侨胞是如何热爱祖国、热爱人民志愿军同志，并且使我更有信心地把抗美援朝的宣传推广到海外的亲友中间去。同时，我希望所有归国华侨利用各种方式，对海外的侨胞及自己亲友展开宣传工作。

    支援志愿军保卫祖国是全国人民的光荣任务编辑同志：
    看到中国人民赴朝慰问团廖承志团长答新华社记者问，知道中国人民志愿军在和敌作战中需要更多的飞机、坦克等近代化武器和有丰富营养的食品。我感到支援志愿军，是每一个中国人民应该担负的光荣义务。中国人民如果人人能踊跃捐输，积腋成裘，给志愿军同志们购买大量地飞机与坦克，就能更快地消灭美国侵略军队。我准备在今后五个月中（从六月份起），在我的供给中，每月抽出十斤小米捐给志愿军同志们购买飞机，使他们能够更有力地打击敌人。

    捐出节余生活费用购买飞机争取抗美援朝战争最后胜利编辑同志：
    我是个长期享受供给制待遇的工作人员。今年二月，我们机关干部待遇改为低薪制。几个月来，除了我自己和孩子们的生活费用外，我节余了十万零六千元，存在中国人民银行。
    五月三十日，我听了中国人民抗美援朝总会郭沫若主席和中国人民赴朝慰问团廖承志团长的报告，深为感动。今天我们中国人民能幸福地生活着，是英勇的中国人民志愿军同志们用血肉换来的。他们在艰苦地和美国侵略军队作战！我们应该尽力支援前线，我愿意捐出这笔节余的钱，给中国人民志愿军买飞机和坦克，加强他们的战斗力量，使抗美援朝的最后胜利提早到来。

    全国人民都来捐献飞机大炮  使志愿军更有力地歼灭敌人编辑同志：
    看了报上刊载中国人民赴朝慰问团同志的报告，知道人民志愿军需要更多的飞机大炮。我们全中国人民都要拿出力量来捐献飞机，让人民志愿军更有力地歼灭敌人。现送上我所有的储蓄券五万元，作为飞机献金。我们伟大的祖国人口众多，只要大家都担负起这样一个光荣的捐献任务，有钱出钱，有力出力，这就会形成一个无比巨大的力量。

            美国飞机使我家破人亡  我要捐献飞机保卫祖国编辑同志：
    美帝国主义的飞机不断滥炸我国安东等地，使我国人民的生命财产受到损失。每一个中国人民，对美帝国主义这种无耻行动都感到无比痛恨。
    当我在报上看到这些消息时，旧恨新仇一起涌上我的心头。就是美帝国主义的飞机，害得我家破人亡。一九四八年，美帝国主义供给蒋介石匪帮屠杀中国人民的飞机，炸毁了我的家；炸死了我的父亲和母亲，我的弟弟和妹妹受了重伤。当时，死的没法埋葬，活的没法生活。感谢人民政府，医好了我弟妹的伤，使他们都能有了工作。现在，美帝国主义的飞机又侵入我国国境，轰炸我国人民。全中国人民决不能容忍。
    我除了决心做好现岗位上的工作，以实际行动抗美援朝外，还要把我储蓄了几个月的零用钱作为飞机献金。同时，我希望大家都来响应这个运动，让我们有更多的空军，保卫祖国的领空。
