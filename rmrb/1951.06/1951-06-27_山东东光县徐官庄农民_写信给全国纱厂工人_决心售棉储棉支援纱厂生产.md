Farmers of Xuguan Village, Dongguang County, Shandong
Write a Letter to Workers of National Textile Mills
Determined to Sell and Store Cotton to Support Textile Mill Production
The farmers of Xuguan Village, Dongguang County, a famous cotton-producing area in Shandong, wrote a letter to the workers of textile mills across the country, expressing their sincere greetings and resolving to sell and store cotton for the country with patriotic actions, so that the textile mills can start work as soon as possible and join hands to produce together. The original letter is as follows:
Dear comrades, workers of textile mills across the country:

　　After hearing the news conveyed by our superiors that the textile mills were recently forced to temporarily suspend work due to a shortage of raw materials, we all felt very anxious and sad. We all know that today's factories belong to our people, and they produce for our people every day. We should protect them and have the responsibility to cherish them. The shutdown of factories is not only detrimental to the country's economic construction and support for Korea, but also directly detrimental to our farmers. We are very clear that without your hard work, the cotton we produce would not have such a good market and even more so a reasonable price. Therefore, we all believe that the improvement of our cotton farmers' lives is closely related to your labor, so our workers and farmers should join hands to produce together and further improve our lives.

　　This year, in order to support our cotton farmers' production, the superiors have spent a lot of money to lend us fertilizers, Si brand cotton seeds, and a lot of grain to solve our difficulties. With the enthusiastic help of the superiors, this year's seedlings are growing very well, there is really hope for a good harvest! We are now clearing and hoeing the seedlings! The country is helping us so much, we must not relax our attention to the country's temporary small difficulties. We are determined to respond wholeheartedly to the country's call to sell and store cotton.

　　It is said that our past backward China relied on American cotton for spinning. The American imperialists took this opportunity to oppress and exploit us. Now they are blockading our people's China and not allowing cotton imports. Dear worker comrades, can we bow our heads to their blockade? Can we show them that we are afraid? No! We must never bow our heads, never be afraid. All of us farmers have decided to sell all the cotton we have now to the state without keeping a single catty, or store it for the state, to help the factories start work as soon as possible. Let me tell you! There is still a lot of cotton left with the farmers! We not only guarantee to sell all the cotton in our village to the state, but also mobilize all our relatives and friends to do the same, unite the strength of the broad masses of the people, and break the imperialist blockade. Rest assured! We farmers are determined to support you with all our strength and run our factories well.

　　Finally, I hope that you will study hard during this vacation, and everyone will study and improve your skills, and prepare to start production in the future. If you have any difficulties in your life and study, please tell us.

　　With best regards,
　　All the farmers of Xuguan Village, Third District, Dongguang County

　　山东东光县徐官庄农民
    写信给全国纱厂工人
    决心售棉储棉支援纱厂生产
    山东著名产棉区东光县的徐官庄农民写信给全国纱厂工人，表示亲切慰问，决以爱国的行动售棉储棉给国家，使纱厂早早开工，携起手来共同生产。原信如下：亲爱的全国纱厂工人同志们：
    我们听到上级传达最近纱厂因缺少原料，被迫暂时停工的消息后，大家感到很焦急、很难过，我们都知道今天的工厂是我们人民自己的，它每天为我们人民生产，我们应当保护它，有责任爱护它。工厂停工不但对国家经济建设不利，对支援朝鲜不利，而且对我们农民直接不利。我们很清楚：如果没有你们的辛勤劳动，我们生产出的棉花不会有这样好的销路，更不会有这样合理的价格。因此，我们大伙认为俺棉农的生活改善与你们的劳动是有密切联系的，所以咱们工人、农民应该携起手来，共同生产，使咱们的生活更进一步地得到改善。
    今年上级为扶持我们棉农生产，曾费了很大的本钱，贷给我们肥料，贷给我们斯字棉种，并贷给我们不少的粮食，解决我们的困难。在上级这样热心的帮助下，今年的小苗长的太好了，真有丰收的希望啊！我们现在正在清苗、锄苗哩！国家这样帮助我们，我们绝不能对国家暂时的一点小困难放松不管，我们决全心全意地响应国家售棉储棉的号召。
    听说咱们过去落后的中国，是依赖美国棉花纺纱，美帝国主义者便借着这个来压迫咱剥削咱，现在它又对我们人民的中国进行封锁，不让棉花进口。亲爱的工人同志们：我们能向它的封锁低头吗？我们能向它表示害怕吗？不！我们绝不能低头，绝不能害怕。我们全体农民决定将现在所存的棉花一斤不留的全部卖给国家或存给国家，帮助工厂早早开工。告诉你们吧！现在农民还有不少的棉花呢！我们不但保证将全村的棉花卖给国家，而且还要动员我们的一切亲友也要这样作，把广大人民力量团结起来，打破帝国主义的封锁。你们放心吧！我们农民决以全力来支援你们，把咱们的工厂搞好。
    最后，希望你们在这休假期间好好学习，大家研究技术提高技术，准备将来好开工生产。你们生活学习还有什么困难希告诉我们。
            此致敬礼
      东光县三区徐官庄全体农民启
