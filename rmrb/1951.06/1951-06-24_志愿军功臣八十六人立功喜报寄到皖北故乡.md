Citations for merit and award certificates for eighty-six People's Volunteer Army heroes, natives of northern Anhui including Zhao Yukun, Yin Shiying, and Zhou Zhongying, were sent from the Korean front on the 12th to Hefei. Among them, eleven, including Zhao Yukun, Huang Sheng, and Yin Shiying, were awarded first-class merit; thirty-four, including Zhou Zhongying, Liu Guanying, Zhang Guoxin, and Pan Youde, were awarded second-class merit; thirty-two, including Zhao Kewen and Zhang Shiyuan, were awarded third-class merit; and nine, including Zhang Zhenyou and Cao Shijiang, were awarded fourth-class merit or minor merit. Many of them have repeatedly performed meritorious service more than twice.

Along with the citations for merit, the people's heroes also enclosed letters home, reporting on their combat and living conditions on the Korean front. These letters were filled with patriotic enthusiasm and strong fighting will. The heroes also encouraged their families to work hard to increase production and resist America, aid Korea. Hero Zhang Guoxin told his parents in his letter: "If we don't resist America and aid Korea, our family will not be able to live safely. We must wipe out all the American devils in Korea. In the future, we will further promote revolutionary heroism and strive for more and greater merits." Zhou Zhongying said in his letter home: "I hope you will do your part in the national movement to resist America and aid Korea, carry out propaganda, increase production, and support us more forcefully so that we can annihilate the enemy more quickly and liberate all of Korea."

The citations for merit of the people's heroes will be brought to each family member by the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, who recently returned to various places to report to the people. The Northern Anhui branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association has decided to meticulously produce eighty-six red silk banners with the four characters "Family of Heroes" stitched on them, and distribute them to each hero's family. The people's governments in various parts of northern Anhui will also, at the same time as sending citations for merit and silk banners, examine and discuss preferential treatment work, formulate plans, and mobilize the masses to do this work well together.

　　志愿军功臣八十六人立功喜报寄到皖北故乡
    原籍皖北的中国人民志愿军功臣赵玉坤、尹世英、周仲英等八十六人的立功喜报及奖状，于十二日由朝鲜前线寄到合肥。其中立一等功的有赵玉坤、黄生、尹世英等十一人，立二等功的有周仲英、刘贯英、张国新、潘友德等三十四人，立三等功的有赵克文、张世远等三十二人，立四等功或小功的有张振友、曹世江等九人。其中有不少人曾连续立功两次以上。
    人民功臣们在寄出喜报时，还附寄了家信，报告他们在朝鲜前线的战斗和生活情形。这些信中充满了爱国热情和坚强的战斗意志。功臣们并鼓励家属努力增产，抗美援朝。功臣张国新在信中告诉他的父母说：“如果不抗美援朝，我们家中就不能安全过活。我们一定要把在朝鲜的美国鬼子全部消灭。以后我们决进一步发扬革命英雄主义，争取功上加功。”周仲英在家信中说：“希望你们在祖国的抗美援朝运动中，多出一把力，进行宣传，增加生产，更有力地支援我们，使我们更迅速地歼灭敌人，解放全朝鲜。”
    人民功臣们的喜报将由最近返回各地向人民作传达报告的中国人民赴朝慰问团的代表们，带给各个家属。皖北抗美援朝分会已决定精制八十六面缀有“功臣之家”四字的红色锦旗，分送每一功臣家属。皖北各地人民政府亦将于送喜报、送锦旗的同时，检查与讨论优抚工作，订出计划，并发动群众一齐来把这个工作做好。
