The Battle Between Man and Beast
    Xu Zhucheng, Representative of the Shanghai Municipal Journalists Association, Member of the Third Sub-group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

    The Korean battlefield is a great classroom. It can teach you many truths and allow you to truly understand many things that you didn't understand deeply enough before.

    When you cross the Yalu River, you concretely see the cruelty and barbarity of American imperialism; you understand why we resist America and aid Korea, and why to protect our homes and defend our country, we must resolutely resist America and aid Korea.

    Every city bombed into ruins by the American aggressors and every peaceful village destroyed tells you these truths. Every heroic Chinese and Korean People's soldier, every Korean person who has suffered greatly and yet fights so resolutely and bravely, is our best teacher.

    In this great classroom, I have come to understand a truth even more profoundly. Why are the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army able to defeat American imperialism, armed to the teeth, under all kinds of difficult conditions? One of the fundamental reasons is that our soldiers have a high level of political consciousness, understand that we are fighting for peace and justice, understand that our just war will ultimately be victorious, and also understand how to overcome difficulties and strive for victory. The American aggressors' army, on the other hand, comes from a decadent capitalist society, and is forced and deceived into going to the Korean battlefield to carry out a cruel and barbaric war of aggression. They simply do not know why they have come to Korea to fight, so their morale cannot help but be low. When they truly understand the nature of this war, they become even more homesick and war-weary, and hate Truman and MacArthur, those warmongers, even more. At the same time, they are not only confused and cowardly, but the various brutal crimes of burning, killing, raping, and looting they have committed in Korea are so hateful. A Korean old man who recounted the atrocities of the U.S. military to us said: "They (referring to the American aggressors) are simply not human beings, they are beasts!"

    In stark contrast to the American aggressors' brutality, cowardice, confusion, and corruption are the Chinese Volunteer Army's bravery and skill in battle, their ability to endure hardship, and their confidence in victory; they so love their motherland, love world peace, and love the Korean people. The Korean people say to us: "We have never seen an army like the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which can fight and also cherish and help us so much." Their unanimous conclusion is that Chairman Mao educated them well.

    We have seen with our own eyes more than once our soldiers chopping firewood and fetching water for Korean old people, cleaning yards, making Korean children laugh with simple Korean words, helping them herd cattle, and helping them with spring plowing during breaks in the fighting. The Volunteer Army soldiers cherish the Korean people as if they were their own flesh and blood.

    Mr. Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean Writers Association, said: "As long as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been to a village once, the people all say: We hope they will come again, it would be good if they stayed at our house for another day."

    Kim Won-ju, the commander of a Korean People's Army regiment, told us: "We see the Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers who have been captured treat us like barbarians, even though we are from the same country. But our people see the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and although we are of different nationalities and do not speak the same language, we are as close as a family." Commander Kim Won-ju's words specifically illustrate the internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and also illustrate the strict discipline and noble qualities of our Volunteer Army.

    Our Volunteer Army soldiers, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army soldiers, have written pledges one after another, guaranteeing that they will not return home until final victory is achieved and the American aggressors are completely annihilated. On the Han River front, on a hilltop that had just been recaptured by us, one of our soldiers discovered the corpse of a Korean woman who had been raped and murdered by the U.S. military while digging fortifications. This soldier was stunned for a moment, and the other soldiers also gathered around. Everyone lowered their heads, and tears welled up in their eyes. This bloody fact further strengthened their determination to resist America and aid Korea. They wrote a pledge right on this position, vowing to avenge this victim and eliminate those American fascist beasts. What great emotion, what lofty will!

    Not only our Volunteer Army, but also our Volunteer stretcher teams, labor teams, and medical teams are trusted and loved by the Korean people, because they also strictly enforce mass discipline and sincerely cherish and help the Korean people, just like the Volunteer Army. The following is just one story among thousands of moving stories:

    Wang Jingui, a civilian laborer from Jin County, joined the volunteer labor team to Korea last year and was severely criticized by his group for using a bowl of rice from the local people. Later, he improved himself through practical experience and resolved to do a good job and strive for merit. His brigade was transferred to work near Pyongyang this year, and he stayed at the home of a Korean military family surnamed Li. The family only had an old man, his daughter-in-law, and two young grandchildren, and they were too busy to handle all the work at home. The old man said: "Since they (referring to Comrade Wang Jingui and other laborers) came, my daughter-in-law has never carried water, there is enough firewood to burn, and the house and yard are clean, and someone feeds and herds the cattle." One day in the middle of the night, a strong wind blew down the family's cowshed, and the cow was mooing inside. Comrade Wang Jingui braved the biting wind to rescue the cow; and the next morning, he called on all the comrades in his group to help the local people repair the cowshed. Everyone immediately went up the mountain to cut trees and down the mountain to weave straw curtains, and the cowshed was completely built on the same day. While they were rushing to repair the cowshed, the old man and woman of the Li family thanked them with tears in their eyes, and seeing Wang Jingui climbing up and down to work in his ragged clothes, they felt unspeakable gratitude and discomfort. When Wang Jingui got up early the next morning, he saw that his clothes had been washed clean and mended properly. It turned out that the local people had secretly taken his clothes away at night to wash, dry, and mend them as quickly as possible.

    When we were in China, we also heard many heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army and vivid stories of how they cherished the Korean people. When we arrived in Korea, we deeply realized the representativeness of these stories, and realized that in the anti-aggression struggle in Korea, every member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, the Chinese volunteer stretcher teams, labor teams, and medical teams, as well as the people in various departments of Korea who participated in the struggle, had moving and admirable heroic stories. In short, the soldiers and civilians in thousands of battles on the Korean battlefield all have such noble qualities and self-sacrificing spirit; they are all immortal figures in the solemn history of defending world peace.

    In this solemn classroom, we concretely see the difference between man and beast; we see the bravery and fearlessness of the Chinese and Korean people's forces and the Korean people, and the brutality and cowardice of the American aggressors; and we also see more clearly the inevitable result of this war: that is, the Chinese and Korean people will surely win the final victory, and the American aggressors will eventually be eliminated!

　　人与兽的战斗
    中国人民赴朝慰问团第三分团团员上海市新闻工作者协会代表  徐铸成
    朝鲜战场是一个大课堂，它能使你懂得许多道理，使你真实地了解到许多原来了解得不够深切的东西。
    当你渡过鸭绿江以后，你就具体地看到了美帝国主义的残酷和野蛮；懂得了我们为什么要抗美援朝，为什么要保家卫国就必须坚决地抗美援朝。
    每一个被美国侵略者炸成废墟的城市和被破坏的和平乡村，都真实地告诉你这些道理。每一个英勇的中朝人民战士，每一个受尽了苦难而又那么坚决勇敢战斗的朝鲜人民，都是我们的最好的老师。
    在这个大课堂里，我更加深刻地懂得了一个道理。为什么朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在种种困难的条件下，能够战胜武装到牙齿的美帝国主义呢？基本的原因之一，就是我们的战士有高度的政治觉悟，懂得我们是为和平与正义而战，懂得我们的正义战争最后必胜，也懂得如何去克服困难，争取胜利。而美国侵略者的军队，来自腐朽的资本主义的社会，被强迫欺骗送到朝鲜战场，进行着残酷野蛮的侵略战争，他们根本不知道为什么要到朝鲜来打仗，因此士气就不会不低落。等到他们真正懂得了这个战争的性质，那就更思家厌战，更痛恨杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟那些战争贩子了。同时他们不仅是糊涂、怯懦，而且他们在朝鲜所做的种种烧杀淫掠的残暴罪行，是那么令人切齿痛恨。一位向我们诉述美军暴行的朝鲜老人说：“他们（指美国侵略军）简直不是人，是禽兽！”
    和美国侵略军的残暴、怯懦、糊涂、腐化恰恰相反的，是我们志愿军的英勇善战，刻苦耐劳而又充满着胜利的信心；他们那么热爱自己的祖国，热爱世界和平，热爱朝鲜的人民。朝鲜的人民对我们说：“我们从来没有见过像中国人民志愿军这样的军队，会打仗，又这样爱护我们，帮助我们。”他们一致的结论：是毛主席教育得好。
    我们不只一次地亲眼看到我们的战士们在战斗间隙中为朝鲜老百姓挑柴打水，打扫院子，用简单的朝鲜话逗着朝鲜孩子们发笑，帮助他们放牛，帮助他们春耕。志愿军的战士们爱护朝鲜人民，就像自己的骨肉一样的亲切。
    朝鲜作家协会主席韩雪野先生说：“只要是中国人民志愿军到过一次的乡村，老百姓都说：我们盼望他们再来就好，再到我们家里住一天也是好的。”
    朝鲜人民军的金元柱团长对我们说：“我们看到被俘掳来的李承晚伪军，像遇着野蛮人一样，虽然我们是同一国的人。而我们的人民看到中国人民志愿军，虽然国籍不同，言语不通，却亲切得像一家人。”金元柱团长的话具体地说明了中朝两国人民国际主义的友爱，也说明了我志愿军的严格的纪律和高贵的品质。
    我们的志愿军战士们在和朝鲜人民军战士们并肩作战中，纷纷立下决心书，保证不到最后胜利，不把美国侵略者彻底消灭，决不回国。在汉江前线，一个刚刚被我夺回的山头上，我们的一位战士在挖掘工事时，发现了一个被美军蹂躏后杀害的朝鲜女子的尸体，这位战士愣了一下，其他的战士们也围上来了，大家低下了头，热泪夺眶而出。这血淋淋的事实，更增强了他们抗美援朝的决心。他们就在这阵地上立下了决心书，决心为这位死难者报仇，消灭那些美国法西斯野兽。这是多么伟大的感情，崇高的意志！
    不仅是我们的志愿军，就是我们的志愿担架队、民工队、医疗队，也一样受到朝鲜人民的信赖和热爱，因为他们也和志愿军一样严格执行群众纪律，真诚地爱护和帮助朝鲜人民。下面就是千千万万动人故事中的一个故事：
    锦县民工王金贵，他在去年参加志愿民工队去朝鲜后，曾经因为用了老百姓一碗米受到小组严厉的批评。后来，他在实际生活的体验中提高了自己，决心做好工作，争取立功。他们的一大队今年调到平壤附近工作，他借住在一个姓李的朝鲜军属的家里，那家只有一位老人和他的媳妇、两个小孙子，家里的活多忙不过来。那位老人说：“自从他们（指王金贵等民工同志）来到以后，我的媳妇从来没顶过水，柴也够烧了，屋子院子都干净了，牛也有人喂、有人放了。”有一天半夜刮大风，把那家的牛棚吹倒了，牛压在里面哞哞地叫。王金贵同志冒着刺骨的大风，起来抢救出这条牛；并且在第二天一早，号召他们全小组的同志，帮助老百姓修好牛棚，大家立刻上山伐树木，下山编草帘，当天就把一座牛棚全搭好了。在他们抢修牛棚时，李家一老一妇，流着泪感谢他们，看到王金贵穿着破衣服爬上翻下地工作，心中说不出的感激和难受。第二天一早起身，王金贵看见自己的衣服已经洗得干干净净，补得好好的了。原来老百姓夜里已偷偷地把他的衣服拿去赶紧洗好、烘干、补上了。
    我们在国内时，也听到不少志愿军的英雄事迹和他们怎样爱护朝鲜人民的生动故事。到了朝鲜，才深切地体会到这些故事的代表性，才知道在朝鲜的反侵略战斗中，中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军、中国志愿担架队、民工队和医疗队中的每一个人，以及朝鲜各部门参加战斗的人民，都有着动人的可歌可泣的英雄故事。简单说，在朝鲜战场千千万万战斗中的军民，都有着这样高贵的品质和忘我的牺牲精神；他们都是保卫世界和平的庄严历史中的不朽人物。
    在这个庄严的大课堂里，我们具体地看到了人兽之间的区别；看到了中朝人民部队和朝鲜人民的英勇无畏，美国侵略者的残暴和怯懦；也更明确地看清了这一战争的必然结果：那就是中朝人民必获最后的胜利，美国侵略者必将最后被消灭！
