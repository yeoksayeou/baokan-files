　　Bank of Communications Begins Handling Basic Construction Investment Appropriations

　　Starting June 1st, the Bank of Communications, designated by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, began handling state basic construction investment appropriations for industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, public utilities (including municipal construction), agriculture, water conservancy, trade, and geological surveying. This work is carried out in accordance with the "Decision on the Budget System, Budget Review, Investment Construction Plans, and Monetary Management" issued by the Government Administration Council in December 1950, and the principles of Chapter V, "Supervision of Basic Construction Investment," of the "Monetary Management Implementation Measures" promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. To adapt to the current specific situation, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has drafted the "Provisional Implementation Measures for the Bank of Communications to Handle Basic Construction Appropriations and Supervise Their Use." The main content is to change the basic construction appropriations in the fiscal budget to be disbursed by the Bank of Communications. Local branches of the Bank of Communications will handle payments based on the appropriation permit notices issued by the General Management Office and the monthly fund-use plans submitted by the construction units and approved by higher authorities, and will be responsible for on-site inspection and supervision of the funds used by each unit. The Bank of Communications' supervision of basic construction investment is a measure of great significance for the country to move towards planned construction and establish a scientific economic construction system. Its role mainly lies in ensuring the strict division of long-term and short-term funds, implementing the principle of designated funds for designated purposes, so that construction funds are used reasonably, economically, and effectively, and completing the country's basic construction work according to plan.

　　交通银行开始办理基本建设投资拨款
    交通银行自六月一日起，经中国人民银行总行指定，开始办理国家对工矿、交通、公用（包括市政建设）、农业、水利、贸易、地质勘测等事业的基本建设投资拨款，并监督其使用。这一工作，系根据一九五○年十二月政务院《关于决算制度、预算审核、投资的施工计划和货币管理的决定》和政务院财政经济委员会公布的《货币管理实施办法》第五章《监督基本建设投资》的原则办理的。为适应目前具体情况，中央人民政府财政部特草拟了《交通银行办理基本建设拨款并监督其使用的临时试行办法。》其主要内容，是将财政预算上的基本建设拨款改由交通银行拨付。各地交通银行根据总管理处发出的拨款许可通知书和建设单位提送的经上级核准的月份用款计划办理付款，并对各单位支用的款项负责就地检查监督。交通银行监督基本建设投资，是国家迈向计划建设、树立科学化的经济建设制度上具有重大意义的措施。其作用主要在保证长短期资金严格的划分，贯彻专款专用的原则，使建设资金合理节约而有效地使用，按计划完成国家基本建设工作。
