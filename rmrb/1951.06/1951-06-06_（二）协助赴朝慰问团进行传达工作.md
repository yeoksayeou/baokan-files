   (II) Assisting the Visiting North Korea慰问团in Dissemination Work
    After completing their mission of慰问ing the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the front lines, the Chinese People's Visiting North Korea慰问团will return to the country and, starting today, will depart from the capital in batches to make reports in cities and counties across the country. Their work will play a significant role in further deepening the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, promoting the patriotic convention movement, increasing production and donations, and promoting preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs. Local branches of this association, as well as various groups and institutions, should actively assist them in doing a good job of dissemination to the masses. Based on the experience of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army in making reports in various places, sufficient publicity should be carried out to the masses before their arrival, mobilizing the masses to prepare for welcome, and other organizational preparations should be made in advance. In order to help them do a good job of dissemination and to make their dissemination truly helpful in raising the political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the local people, and helpful to the further development of the local patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we must help them first understand the actual work situation of the local area and the political and ideological trends of the local people. At the same time, we must make the steps of the local patriotic movement cooperate with their dissemination reports as much as possible, and further organize the patriotic activities of the masses after they make dissemination reports.

   （二）协助赴朝慰问团进行传达工作
    中国人民赴朝慰问团，在完成到前线慰问我国志愿军及朝鲜人民军的任务而回国之后，从今日开始，陆续自首都出发，分赴全国各市、县作传达报告。他们的这个工作，对于推动抗美援朝更加深入一步，对于推动爱国公约运动以及增产捐献和优抚烈军属运动的开展，将有极大作用，本会各地分会以及各团体，各机构，应该积极协助他们向人民群众做好传达工作。根据志愿军归国代表在各地做报告的经验，在他们到达以前，就应向群众作充分的宣传，发动群众准备欢迎，并应在事先做好其他组织准备工作。为着帮助他们做好传达工作，并使他们的传达工作真正有助于提高当地人民的政治觉悟和革命热情，有助于当地抗美援朝爱国运动的进一步发展，就要帮助他们首先了解当地的实际工作情况和当地人民的政治思想动态，同时，还要尽可能地使当地的开展爱国运动的工作步骤与他们的传达报告互相配合，在他们作传达报告之后，进一步组织群众的爱国活动。
