A Model Worker's Family
Introducing Activists in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
Huang Zhuya

The family of Yang Qinglin, a special-class coal cutter at the Hegang Coal Mine, is a model worker's family. The Yang Qinglin family lives in a new-style house on Gaogang Street, Nanshan Mine. The floors in the house are shiny from scrubbing, and the kang (heated brick bed) is covered with a snow-white sheet, with three sets of brand-new red quilts stacked high. On the snow-white walls hang three certificates of merit and a silk banner: The topmost banner, a "Model Women" banner, was awarded to Old Lady Yang by the Municipal Women's Federation; below it is a certificate of merit awarded to Yang Qinglin by the three ministers of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department, which reads: "Comrade Yang Qinglin has created a new record. We hope you will maintain this honor and continue to advance!" The two certificates of merit at the bottom were awarded to Yang Qinglin's sister-in-law, Jin Yaomei, and his wife, Zheng Shuxian, by the Municipal Women's Federation. Walking into this family, you immediately feel that this is a new family actively participating in the economic construction of the motherland, and the whole family is full of the new atmosphere of the new society.

Old Lady Yang is already fifty-nine years old, but she is quite healthy. She manages all the family affairs and does the cooking. Since the American devils invaded Korea, Old Lady Yang angrily said: "They can't kill Korean people, they are our good neighbors. We can't just stand by and watch. As the saying goes, 'Beat the wolf to death outside the gate, or it will definitely become a disaster.' We were able to defeat the Japanese devils, can't we defeat the American devils? As long as the people of the whole country are united as one, who is afraid of this bastard!"

Enraged, Old Lady Yang challenged the whole family to improve household affairs and do a good job in family propaganda work. The first to respond was sixty-two-year-old Old Man Yang. His condition was: to mobilize all the nearby residents to work hard, produce more coal, and increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea. Next, his daughters-in-law, Jin Yaomei and Zheng Shuxian, also responded (both of them work in the mine). Jin Yaomei guaranteed that the safety lamp charging would last for eight hours, and she would also save materials and repair fifty waste lamp heads... Zheng Shuxian proposed to ensure accurate drawing and no wasted time.

Little grandson Fugui is the captain of the Young Pioneers team at Nanshan Elementary School and has been elected as a model student in the whole school. His condition for responding to Old Lady Yang was: to respect teachers and love classmates at school, and to help chop wood and sweep the yard at home after school. The last to respond was Yang Qinglin. When he returned from a meeting in Beijing and saw everyone in the family working harder than the next, he was extremely happy and immediately responded to Old Lady Yang. When he returned to the mine, he worked even harder. He often said to the workers: "Resisting America and aiding Korea is a major event for us workers right now. It's not enough to just talk about it. We are fighting in the coal pit! Whether you are a hero or a good man will be seen at this critical juncture!"

　　一个模范的工人家庭
    抗美援朝运动中的积极分子介绍
    黄主亚
    鹤岗煤矿特等截煤机手杨青林家，是一个模范的工人家庭。杨青林家住在南山矿高岗街一座新式房子里。屋内地板刷得光溜溜的，炕上铺着雪白的被单，里、面、套三新的红被褥叠的挺高。雪白的墙壁上，挂着三个奖状和一面锦旗：最上面的一面模范妇女锦旗，是市妇联奖给杨老大娘的；下面是东北人民政府工业部三位部长，奖给杨青林的奖状，上面写着：杨青林同志创造了新纪录，望保持荣誉继续前进！最下边的两个奖状，是市妇联奖给杨青林的嫂嫂金耀梅，和他的爱人郑淑贤的。走进这个家庭，使你立即感到这是一个积极参加祖国经济建设的新家庭，全家充满新社会里的新气象。
    杨老大娘，已经是五十九岁的人了，身体挺健壮，她管理着全家的事务和做饭。自从美国鬼子侵略朝鲜，老大娘就气愤地说：“它杀朝鲜老百姓可不成，那是咱们的好邻居，咱们不能瞪眼瞧着。常言说：‘打狼打死大门外，不打一定成祸害。’我们能打败日本鬼子，还不能打败美国鬼子吗？只要全国人民拧成一根绳，谁怕他这个鬼杂种！”
    愤怒了的杨老大娘，用搞好家务、做好家属宣传工作向全家提出挑战。首先应战的是六十二岁的杨老大爷。他的条件是：把附近居民全动员起来，好好生产，多出煤炭，增加抗美援朝的力量。接着，儿媳妇金耀梅、郑淑贤也应战了（她俩都在矿上工作）。金耀梅保证安全灯充电能顶八小时，还要节省材料，并修理废灯头五十个……。郑淑贤提出保证绘图精确，不浪费时间。
    小孙子富贵，是南山小学少年儿童队的大队长，当选过全校的模范学生。他向杨老大娘应战的条件是：在学校里尊敬老师，爱护同学，放学到家里帮助劈木料，扫院子。最后应战的是杨青林。他在北京开会回来时，看到家里干活一个赛一个，高兴极了，立刻向杨大娘应了战。回到矿上，工作就更起劲了。他常跟工人说：“抗美援朝，是咱工人眼下一件大事，光嘴说可不行。咱这是在煤坑里战斗呢！是英雄、是好汉就在这个节骨眼上见了！”
