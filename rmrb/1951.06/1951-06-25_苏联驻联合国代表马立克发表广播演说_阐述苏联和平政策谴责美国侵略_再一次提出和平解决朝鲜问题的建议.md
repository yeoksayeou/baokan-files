Xinhua News Agency, June 24th. TASS, New York, June 24th: The United Nations Department of Public Information held a radio program called "The Price of Peace," inviting representatives of several countries to the United Nations to participate. The Soviet Representative to the UN, Malik, delivered a speech on this program on June 23rd.

Malik said, "It is quite obvious that 'The Price of Peace' radio program should serve the cause of consolidating peace and assist the forces of peace in their noble struggle to prevent war. People all over the world recognize that peace has the greatest value for mankind.

It has not been six years since the end of World War II, which sacrificed the lives of millions of human beings; and the peace that was obtained at such a high price is now threatened again.

The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are trying to convince their people that in order to maintain peace, they must arm themselves, and they must establish a ‘position of strength,’ and they insist that this can make another war impossible.

However, it should be clear to everyone that all those who hope for peace must strive to resolve the problems that arise in the relations between their country and other countries by means of peace.

The Soviet government has repeatedly stated that the policy pursued by the United States, Britain, France, and several other countries is thoroughly malicious, inevitably leading to new international conflicts, and fraught with the danger of another world war. It is precisely because of this policy of the Western countries that the serious tension in the current international situation has been created.

The establishment of the North Atlantic Military Alliance is the main reason for the deterioration of relations between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers. The politicians of the countries participating in this group do not hide the fact that this military alliance is directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. It is enough to point out that American newspapers and magazines publish maps and charts every day, indicating the network of American military bases in Europe and the Near East that surround the Soviet Union, and explaining the routes of American bombers attacking Soviet industrial centers from these bases.

Everyone knows that at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Assistants preparatory meeting in Paris, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France have been doing everything possible to oppose the Soviet proposal – to include the mature issues of American military bases and the Atlantic Pact on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' meeting responsible for studying all the most important issues related to ensuring peace. This attitude adopted by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France cannot but lead people to believe that they are trying to maintain the existing international tension.

Concluding the North Atlantic Treaty, establishing American military bases on foreign territories, rearming West Germany and establishing West German forces, assisting the revival of Japanese militarism, conducting a frantic arms race, and increasing the armies of the North Atlantic group of countries (primarily the United States) – these are some of the facts that characterize the aggressive policies currently pursued by Western countries.

The armed intervention of the United States and other countries dependent on the United States in Korea is the most vivid manifestation of this policy. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several other countries have repeatedly proposed peaceful solutions to the Korean conflict. The war is still going on in Korea entirely because the United States has consistently obstructed the acceptance of these peaceful proposals.

Seizing the island of Taiwan, which belongs to China, and bombing Chinese territory undeniably prove that the United States is trying to expand the military conflict in the Far East. However, experience has shown that this will only make the people of Asian countries more united, because they rightly believe that this policy of the American ruling group is dangerous to their security and independence.

The campaign to expand armaments and the policy of preparing for another war have affected the people of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. Before World War II, in 1938-1939, the annual military expenditure of the US government averaged nearly eight US dollars per person based on the national population; in 1950, the cost of preparing for war by the US government averaged 147 US dollars per person, and in 1951 it will increase to an average of 307 US dollars per person.

Only those who make huge profits in the manufacture of war materials benefit from the campaign to expand armaments. The organ newspaper of American capitalists, the Citibank Monthly Letter, admits: The American economy is moving more and more rapidly, month by month, towards making the manufacture of munitions its primary task, and subordinating all civil activities and peacetime lifestyles to this task.

In order to cover up this policy of expanding armaments and establishing aggressive bases, the ruling groups of Western countries are trying to portray the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria as aggressive policies, and their own truly aggressive policies as peaceful policies. However, these arbitrary words have been refuted by facts that cannot be concealed.

The Soviet Union has always consistently defended the cause of peace in the past and at present, and pursues a policy of cooperation with all countries willing to cooperate. The Soviet Union does not threaten any country, and it has never had and will never have plans to conquer others. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy proceeds from the fundamental principles that form the basis of the Soviet social system and the interests of the Soviet people. The efforts of the Soviet people are aimed at peaceful construction. The Soviet state is engaged in developing civil industry, building huge hydropower stations and irrigation systems on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the Amu Darya River, and implementing plans to transform nature to ensure abundant and stable agricultural harvests. The peaceful and creative labor carried out by the Soviet people in the post-war years has greatly improved the living standards of the people. As a result of increased wages, planned price reductions, and increased government spending on social and cultural facilities, the total income of workers, staff, and farmers in 1950 increased by 62 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. Obviously, if the Soviet government pursued a policy of expanding armaments and expanding its army, rather than a policy of peaceful construction, peaceful construction of this scale and a significant improvement in the people's living standards would not be possible.

There are hundreds of newspapers and magazines in the United States that openly clamor for an attack on the Soviet Union every day, in violation of the United Nations resolution prohibiting war propaganda. But no one can point out that any Soviet newspaper has called for an attack on the United States or any other country. According to special laws promulgated in the Soviet Union, anyone who intends to engage in war propaganda will be punished as a serious criminal.

The policy of the Soviet government proceeds from the fact that two systems – the socialist system and the capitalist system – coexist peacefully, and adheres to such a policy, that is, to maintain sincere peaceful relations with all countries that are willing to carry out economic cooperation, as long as they abide by the principles of mutual benefit and fulfillment of their commitments.

As early as 1932, in response to the question raised by American journalist Barnes as to whether it was possible to convince the Soviet people and the American people that armed conflict between the two countries would never, and under no circumstances, occur, Stalin said: Regarding the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, it is very easy to convince the people of the two countries of the harm and sin of mutual destruction. But unfortunately: the issue of peace and war is not always decided by the people. I have no doubt that the broad masses of the American people did not want to fight the Soviet people in 1918-1919. But the US government did not, therefore, fail to attack the Soviet Union in 1918, along with Japan, Britain and France, and continued to carry out armed intervention in the Soviet Union until 1919. As for the Soviet Union, it is hardly necessary to prove that the Soviet people and the Soviet government do not want armed conflict between the two countries under any circumstances.

The Soviet government has always maintained a program for safeguarding and consolidating peace and international security. This program advocates cooperation among major powers, as manifested in the proposal to conclude a treaty of consolidating peace. This program stipulates disarmament and the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. This program also stipulates strict compliance with the Potsdam decisions on the German question, concluding peace with Germany and Japan, and expanding trade and economic ties between countries.

The reason why this program has not been able to be implemented is only because it is not favored by the aggressive forces of certain countries, who fear that if this program is implemented, it will disrupt their aggressive measures, prevent the campaign to expand armaments from proceeding, and thus make it impossible for them to obtain tens of billions of dollars in excess profits from war orders.

The Soviet Union actively participated in the establishment of the United Nations. The reason why the Soviet Union actively participated is based on the fact that the strength of this international organization lies in the fact that it is based on the principle of unanimous action by the five major powers, it does not allow isolating any one of these five countries, and its actions will only be effective when all the major powers abide by this principle. However, this principle is often violated, mainly due to the fault of the US government, and the three major powers, the United States, Britain, and France, systematically pursue a policy of isolating the other two major powers – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

At the time of the establishment of the United Nations, the people of the world originally hoped that this organization could become a reliable tool for maintaining international peace and security, and could fulfill the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, so as to prevent future generations from suffering the scourge of war again.

Throughout the period since the establishment of the United Nations, the Soviet Union has continuously taken steps to strengthen this organization, opposing all attempts by certain countries, especially the United States, to set aside the Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security, and to turn this international organization into a tool of one or several countries.

However, due to the various activities of the US ruling group, the United Nations organization is increasingly being transformed into a tool of war, into a tool for launching another world war, and is no longer a world organization of equal countries. The United Nations passed illegal resolutions, retroactively approving the US aggression against Korea and China; the United Nations falsely accused the People's Republic of China, which was defending its borders and trying to recover the island of Taiwan occupied by US troops, as an "aggressor." The illegal decision to impose an embargo on China and the fact that 475 million Chinese people do not yet have representatives in the United Nations also illustrate this point.

The Soviet Union will continue to strive to consolidate peace and prevent another world war. The Soviet people believe that it is possible to maintain the cause of peace, and that the armed conflict in Korea – the most acute issue at present – can also be resolved. And to do this, all parties must have the willingness to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. The Soviet people believe that the first step is that the belligerent parties should negotiate a ceasefire and armistice, and that both sides should withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel.

Is it possible to take this step? I think it is possible, as long as there is a sincere desire to end the bloodshed in Korea.

I believe that to ensure peace in Korea, this price is not too high.”

    阐述苏联和平政策谴责美国侵略  再一次提出和平解决朝鲜问题的建议
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日电：联合国新闻部举办《和平的代价》广播节目，请若干国家驻联合国的代表参加广播。苏联驻联合国代表马立克于六月二十三日在这个广播节目中发表演说。
    马立克说，“事实十分明显，《和平的代价》广播节目应为巩固和平的事业服务，并且协助维护和平的力量从事防止战争的崇高斗争。全世界各国人民都认识到和平对人类具有最巨大的价值。
    自从牺牲了千百万人类生命的第二次世界大战结束以来，到现在还不满六年；而用这样高的代价得来的和平却又受到威胁了。
    美国、英国、法国的统治集团企图使他们的人民相信：为了要保持和平，必须武装起来，必须建立‘有实力的情势’，他们硬说这样可以使另一次战争不可能爆发。
    然而，凡是希望和平的人都必须努力用和平方法解决本国与其他国家之间的关系上所发生的问题，这应该是每一个人都明白的事情。
    苏联政府已一再声明，美国、英国、法国以及其他若干国家所遵循的政策是彻头彻尾地恶毒的，它不可避免地要引起新的国际冲突，充满着另一次世界大战的危险。正是由于西方国家的这种政策，才造成了目前国际局势中的严重的紧张状态。
    北大西洋军事联盟的建立是苏联与西方三国关系恶化的主要原因。参加这个集团的国家的政客们并不隐讳这种军事同盟是针对苏联和各人民民主共和国的。只要指出一点就够了，这就是：美国的报章杂志天天都在刊载地图和图表，指明美国在欧洲和近东的包围苏联的军事基地网，并说明美国轰炸机从这些基地出发袭击苏联工业中心的路线。
    大家都知道，在巴黎的四国外长助理预备工作会议上，美国、英国和法国的代表一直千方百计反对苏联的建议——把关于美国军事基地和大西洋公约的成熟的问题列入有责任研究一切有关保障和平的最重要问题的外长会议的议程。美、英、法三国政府所采取的这种态度，不能不使人认为是力图保持现存国际间紧张局势。
    缔结北大西洋公约、在外国领土上建立美国军事基地、重新武装西德和设立西德军队、协助日本军国主义复活、进行疯狂的军备竞赛和增加北大西洋集团国家（首先是美国）的军队——这些就是刻划西方国家目前所奉行的侵略政策的一些事实。
    美国和依赖美国的其他国家对朝鲜的武装干涉就是这种政策的最生动的表现。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他一些国家曾经一再提出和平解决朝鲜冲突的建议。战争之所以仍在朝鲜进行，完全是因为美国始终阻挠接受这些和平建议。
    攫夺属于中国的台湾岛和轰炸中国的领土无可置辩地证明了美国竭力要扩大远东的军事冲突。可是，经验证明，这只会使亚洲各国人民更加团结起来，因为他们正当地认为美国统治集团的这种政策对于他们的安全和独立是有危险的。
    扩张军备运动和准备另一次战争的政策已使北大西洋公约集团国家的人民受到影响。在第二次世界大战以前的一九三八——一九三九年，美国政府每年的军费支出按全国人口计算，每人平均担负将近八美元；一九五零年，美国政府准备战争的费用每人平均担负一百四十七美元，一九五一年将增加到每人平均三百零七美元。
    只有那些在制造战争物资中得到巨额利润的家伙才在扩张军备运动中得到好处。美国资本家的机关报花旗银行公报承认：美国经济一月比一月迅速地走向使制造军火成为它的主要任务，并使整个的民生活动与和平时期的生活方式服从这一个任务。
    为了掩盖这个扩张军备和建立侵略基地的政策，西方国家的统治集团企图把苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和保加利亚的和平政策说成是侵略政策，而把西方国家统治集团自己的真正是侵略的政策说成是和平政策。然而，这些武断之词已为无法掩饰的事实所驳倒了。
    苏联过去和现在都始终不渝地维护和平事业，并奉行与一切愿意合作的国家合作的政策。苏联不威胁任何国家，它绝没有也不会有征服他人的计划。苏联的和平政策是从成为苏联社会制度的基础的根本原则与苏联人民的利益出发的。苏联人民的努力是以和平建设为目标的。苏维埃国家正在从事于发展民用工业，在伏尔加河、第聂伯河及阿姆达里亚河上建筑巨大的水电站与灌溉系统，实施改造自然的计划，以保证农业收获丰富与稳定。苏联人民在战后年份里所进行的和平的创造性的劳动，使人民的生活水准大大提高了。由于增加工资、有计划地减低物价与国家增加对社会与文化设施的费用的结果，一九五○年工人与职员和农民的总收入比战前一九四○年增加了百分之六十二。显然，如果苏联政府奉行扩张军备与扩大军队的政策，而不是和平建设的政策，那末这种规模的和平建设与人民生活水准的大大提高，是不可能的。
    美国有几百种报纸与杂志违反联合国关于禁止作战争宣传的决议，每天公开叫嚣进攻苏联。但是没有谁能指出有任何苏联报纸会要求进攻美国或任何其他国家。根据在苏联颁布的特别的法律，凡是打算进行战争宣传的人，都要被当作重大罪犯予以惩办。
    苏联政府的政策，是从两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度——和平共存的事实出发，并坚守这样的方针，就是说，与所有表示愿意实行经济合作的国家保持真诚的和平的关系，只要它们遵守互利与履行所承担的义务的原则。
    早在一九三二年，在答复美国记者巴纳斯所提出的有没有可能使苏联人民和美国人民相信两国之间决不会、而且在任何情况下都不会发生武装冲突这一问题时，斯大林说过：关于苏联和美国的关系，使两国人民相信相互毁灭的害处和罪恶是再容易不过了。但不幸的是：和平与战争问题并不总是由人民决定的。我毫不怀疑，美国人民大众在一九一八年——一九一九年并不愿意和苏联人民作战。但是美国政府并没有因此就不在一九一八年与日本、英国和法国一道向苏联进攻，并且继续对苏联实行武装干涉，直到一九一九年。至于苏联，几乎无须证明苏联人民和苏联政府都不希望两国在任何情况下发生武装冲突。
    苏联政府始终是维护巩固和平与国际安全的纲领的。这个纲领主张大国合作，这表现在缔结巩固和平的公约的建议上。这纲领规定裁减军备与无条件禁止原子武器，并建立国际管制监督这种禁令的执行。这纲领还规定严格遵守关于德国问题的波茨坦决定，与德国和日本媾和，扩大各国之间的贸易与经济联系。
    这个纲领之所以没有能够实行，那只是因为它不为某些国家的侵略势力所喜，这些侵略势力害怕这个纲领如果实现，就会破坏他们的侵略措施，使扩张军备运动不能进行，从而使他们无法从战争订货中再取得数十亿美元的超额利润。
    苏联曾积极参加联合国的建立。苏联之所以积极参加是从下列事实出发，就是说：这个国际组织的力量在于它是以五大国行动一致的原则为基础的，它不许孤立这五个国家中的任何一国，而且它的行动只有在各大国都遵守这一原则的时候才会有效。但是，这个原则经常被违犯，主要是由于美国政府的过错，五大国中的美、英、法三国有计划地奉行孤立其他两个大国——苏联和中华人民共和国——的政策。
    在成立联合国组织的时候，世界各国人民原希望这一组织能成为维持国际和平与安全的可靠工具，并且能履行联合国宪章中所规定的义务，以免后世再遭战祸。
    在联合国建立以来的整个时期，苏联不断采取加强这一组织的步骤，反对某些国家，首先是美国，想把担负维持和平与安全之主要责任的安全理事会撇在一边，并把这一国际组织变成一个或若干个国家的工具的一切企图。
    但是，由于美国统治集团的种种活动，联合国组织正日益被变为战争工具，被变为发动另一次世界战争的工具，同时也不再是平等国家的世界组织了。联合国通过了非法的决定，事后批准美国对朝鲜和中国的侵略；联合国诬指保卫自己的边疆和在设法收回被美国军队所强占的台湾岛的中华人民共和国为“侵略者”。对中国实施禁运的非法决定以及四亿七千五百万中国人民还没有代表出席联合国这一事实也说明这一点。
    苏联将继续奋斗以巩固和平，制止另一次世界大战。苏联人民认为，维护和平事业是可能的，朝鲜的武装冲突——目前最尖锐的问题——也是能够解决的。而要做到这一点，就必须各方有和平解决朝鲜问题的意愿。苏联人民认为，第一个步骤是交战双方应该谈判停火与休战，而双方把军队撤离三八线。
    采取这种步骤是可能的吗？我认为是可能的，只要有结束朝鲜境内的流血冲突的真诚愿望。
    我认为，为了确保朝鲜的和平，这代价不算太高。”
