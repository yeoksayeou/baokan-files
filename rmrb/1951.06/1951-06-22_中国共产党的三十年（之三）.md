In March 1949, the Party convened the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, which decided on the Party's basic policies for seizing national victory and after national victory.

The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee pointed out that on the eve of national victory, the focus of the Party's work must shift from rural areas to cities. Since 1927, the Party's basic work has been to gather strength in the countryside and surround the cities with the countryside in order to finally capture the cities. Now that this task has been completed, the focus of the Party's work should be shifted to the cities, and the cities should lead the countryside. The meeting also pointed out that the Party's work in the cities must rely wholeheartedly on the working class and take the restoration and development of industrial production as its central task. The meeting discussed in detail the status of various components of the Chinese economy and the correct policies that the Party should adopt. This discussion later formed the basis of the economic policies in the "Common Program".

At this time, on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instruction of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek pretended to step down, and Li Zongren replaced Chiang Kai-shek to demand "peace." The Chinese Communist Party did not reject this demand for peace, and after negotiating with representatives of the Kuomintang, drafted a draft peace agreement. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government refused to sign the peace agreement, thus exposing its true colors.

On April 21, 1949, Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered the Chinese People's Liberation Army to march towards the south and northwest, liberating all unliberated areas of China. The People's Liberation Army liberated Nanjing on April 23, and successively liberated major cities and vast areas such as Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Hankou, Xi'an, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu within 1949, and peacefully liberated Hunan, Xinjiang, Xikang, Yunnan and other places. In April and May 1950, the People's Liberation Army crossed the sea and liberated Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands. In the southern and southwestern provinces, 1.6 million bandits left behind by the Kuomintang were wiped out in 1950. In November 1950, the People's Liberation Army began marching towards Tibet. In May 1951, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government, after negotiations, established an agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Thus, except for Taiwan, which was still occupied by the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the American invaders, the entire country was liberated.

From July 1946 to June 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of more than 8.07 million Kuomintang reactionary troops, seized more than 54,400 artillery pieces of various types, more than 319,900 machine guns of various types, more than 1,000 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 20,000 vehicles, and other large amounts of weapons and equipment.

On October 1, 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China declared its establishment. The Central People's Government was elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, composed of 662 representatives from various ethnic groups, democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, armed forces and specially invited democratic figures in China. The first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held from September 21 to September 30, 1949. At this meeting, the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China," and the "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" were adopted, Mao Zedong was elected Chairman of the Central People's Government, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, and Gao Gang were elected Vice-Chairmen, and 56 members of the Central People's Government Committee were elected, and Beijing was decided as the capital of the People's Republic of China. The founding of the People's Republic of China gloriously summarized the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism for more than 100 years, especially the Chinese people's struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for 28 years.

The People's Republic of China has been established. The Chinese revolution has since entered a new period. The national situation is completely different from the period when "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government" were published. It is necessary to explain the following questions under the conditions of the victory of the people's democratic revolution: What kind of country is the People's Republic of China? What are the status and interrelationships of the various classes and economic components in this country? What is the future of this country? Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" on July 1, 1949, and the "Common Program" adopted by the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, gave a complete answer to these questions.

In his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Comrade Mao Zedong defined the nature of People's Republic of China as "a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance." Comrade Mao Zedong explained the meaning of this formula by saying: "Who are the people? In China, at the present stage, they are the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. These classes, united under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, form their own state, elect their own government, and exercise dictatorship over the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who represent these classes, exercise dictatorship, oppress these people, only allow them to behave properly, and do not allow them to speak or act recklessly. If they want to speak or act recklessly, they will be immediately banned and punished. Towards the people, a democratic system is implemented, giving freedom of speech, assembly, association, etc. The right to vote is only given to the people, not to the reactionaries. These two aspects, the democratic aspect towards the people and the dictatorial aspect towards the reactionaries, are combined to form the people's democratic dictatorship."

Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly pointed out that the People's Republic of China will inevitably learn from the example of the Soviet Union, move towards socialism and communism, and must resolutely stand on the side of the Soviet Union and on the side of socialism now. However, the People's Republic of China still allows the existence of the national bourgeoisie in the current historical period. This is the difference between the people's democracy in China and the people's democracy in Southeast European countries. This difference is caused by different historical conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage. We still have imperialism standing by, and this enemy is very ferocious. It will take a long time for China to achieve true economic independence. Only when China's industry is developed and China does not rely on foreign countries economically can it have complete and true independence. The proportion of modern industry in China's entire national economy is very small. There are no reliable figures yet, but according to some materials, modern industry accounts for only about 10% of the total national economic output. In order to deal with the oppression of imperialism and to improve the backward economic status, China must utilize all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and not harmful, unite with the national bourgeoisie, and fight together. Our current policy is to restrict capitalism, not to eliminate capitalism." The process of restricting capitalism is a process of both uniting and struggling with the national bourgeoisie, that is, a process of transforming the national bourgeoisie. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The other exploiting classes have been overthrown, leaving only the national bourgeoisie. At the present stage, many appropriate educational tasks can be carried out among them. When socialism is implemented in the future, that is, when private enterprises are nationalized, further educational and transformation work will be carried out on them. The people have a powerful state machine in their hands and are not afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebelling."

Comrade Mao Zedong's basic views on the People's Republic of China have all been established in the "Common Program" in the form of law. The general program of the "Common Program" reads: "The People's Republic of China is a new democratic, that is, a people's democratic country, which implements a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and all ethnic groups in the country, opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strives for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity." The "Common Program" systematically stipulates the basic policies of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front and the People's Republic of China in the current period for politics, military affairs, economy, culture, ethnic groups, and foreign affairs. These policies are the basic policies of the Chinese Communist Party in the current period. The "Common Program" provides a particularly detailed explanation of economic policies. The "Common Program" reads: "The fundamental policy of economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy with the policies of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges. The state should adjust the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy in terms of business scope, raw material supply, sales market, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policy, and monetary policy, so that various social economic components can cooperate with each other, each division of labor, each get what they need, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, to promote the development of the entire social economy." In this way, in the "Common Program," the leading position of the working class in politics and the leading position of the state economy of a socialist nature controlled by the working class in the economy have both been legally recognized, and this leadership is the main guarantee for the development of the People's Republic of China towards socialism.

The founding of the People's Republic of China aroused cheers from the people all over the world. The most loyal international friend of the Chinese people, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on October 2, 1949. The People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Romania, the People's Republic of Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Polish Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of Albania, the Union of Burma, the Republic of India, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation, the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of Finland, and Pakistan have successively established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The United Kingdom, Ceylon, Norway, Israel, Afghanistan, the Netherlands, and other countries have recognized the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China firmly stands on the side of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strives to strengthen the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. On February 14, 1950, under the direct participation of Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Stalin, the two countries, China and the Soviet Union, signed the historically significant Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in Moscow by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Loans to the People's Republic of China. These treaties and agreements greatly strengthened the strength of the world peace and democracy camp and greatly helped the international status and construction cause of the new China.

After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it immediately carried out tremendous work to restore and transform the economy that had been severely damaged by imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and war and famine. The state economy of a socialist nature established by the Central People's Government after confiscating the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital rapidly exerted a great force in the national economic life. Relying on the support of the state economy, the Central People's Government quickly and effectively unified and balanced the country's finances, ended twelve years of hyperinflation, and systematically carried out the massive task of restoring industrial production, agricultural production, transportation, and trade. In order to open up markets and accumulate the capital needed for industrialization, the Central People's Government decided to focus on developing agriculture, light industry, and domestic trade first, while beginning to establish a few of the most essential defense industries and power industries. Because the state economy controls the economic lifeline of the country and has a high degree of centralization, private capitalist industry and commerce are gradually being guided to obey the leadership of the state economy, and the state capitalist economy serving the state economy is gradually developing. And this reorganization or adjustment of industry and commerce to suit the needs of the country is necessary to prepare for planned industrial construction.

The Central People's Government believes that implementing land reform nationwide is one of the main conditions for improving the entire economic situation and preparing for industrial construction. The Central People's Government passed the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China in June 1950, and from the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951, led the peasants in the newly liberated areas to complete land reform in areas with a population of 130 million. Because the war has basically ended, the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China has changed the provisions in the 1947 Chinese Land Law Outline on the issue of dealing with the land of rich peasants, changing from the policy of requisitioning the surplus land of rich peasants to the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, that is, only requisitioning the land rented out by rich peasants under specific conditions, and not touching the rest of the land of rich peasants. This new policy is an important guarantee for the production enthusiasm of middle peasants. At present, land reform work nationwide, including the old liberated areas, has been completed in areas with a population of 290 million, and the remaining areas will be completed within one or two years. The land reform work, as well as the construction of the people's congress power carried out simultaneously nationwide, and the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities participated in by the broad masses of people, have greatly consolidated the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship; without this foundation, planned economic construction would be impossible.

The Chinese Communist Party noticed the decisive significance of the consolidation of the Party in all revolutionary undertakings now and in the future. The Party has expanded rapidly in the years of victory in the People's Liberation War. The Chinese Communist Party now has 5.8 million members. The Party decided to generally stop recruiting members in rural areas of the old areas and focus on absorbing industrial workers into the Party. The Party decided to conduct serious and systematic Marxist-Leninist education among Party members to thoroughly understand the necessity of relying on the working class and the necessity of realizing communism, and to conduct a serious reorganization of the Party organization according to strict standards.

When the Chinese people set about rebuilding their country, they did not forget the threat of new imperialist aggression. The American imperialists, unwilling to fail on this land of China, blatantly occupied Taiwan Province, Chinese territory, in June 1950 while intervening in Korea with arms. The American plunder of Taiwan is in fact only a continuation of the American government's long-term armed intervention in the Chinese People's Liberation War, and the beginning of armed intervention in the People's Republic of China. The American plunder of Taiwan proves that the violent armed intervention launched by the United States against our friendly neighboring country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is part of the overall American plan of aggression against our country. The reason why the American interventionists want to support the "Chiang Kai-shek of Korea" - the Syngman Rhee puppet group - to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is originally to imitate the old methods of the Japanese invaders, first occupying Korea, then seizing Taiwan, and then occupying the Northeast. In October 1950, the American invading army occupied Pyongyang, and then surged northward with a large number of troops, until the Yalu River and the Tumen River near the border between China and Korea, seriously threatening the security of our northeastern border. The American air force continuously bombed and strafed the cities and villages on the northeastern border of our country, causing constant losses to the lives and property of our compatriots. The people of the whole country could not bear it any longer and demanded to resist America, aid Korea, defend their homes, and defend the country with voluntary action. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese democratic parties issued declarations supporting the patriotic demands of the people. In this way, the Chinese people carried out the just struggle to resist America, aid Korea with unparalleled enthusiasm.

As a result of the Chinese People's Volunteers beginning to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front in late October 1950, the dangerous situation once encountered in the Korean people's anti-aggression war was quickly reversed, the frantic attack of the American invading army was repelled from northern Korea, and the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army suffered serious losses. From that time to the present, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have carried out five battles, annihilating more than 193,000 invading troops, including more than 89,000 American invading troops. The invading army, which had suffered heavy blows, has been driven to the vicinity of the 38th parallel in central Korea, and the commander-in-chief of the invading army, the famous American war-monger MacArthur, was also dismissed in April 1951 due to repeated defeats. The Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, regardless of the various difficulties caused by the crazy bombing and destruction of the invading army, heroically helped the Korean people resist American aggression, which aroused cheers from the people of all China, all Korea, and the world, and aroused an unprecedented surge of patriotism among the people of all China. The patriotic people of China firmly believe that the cause of aiding Korea, recovering Taiwan, and consolidating national defense is not only an important guarantee for our country's economic recovery and economic construction, but also an important component of the cause of world peace. Just as the People's Liberation War against Chiang Kai-shek has been victorious, the Chinese people's sacred struggle against American imperialist aggression must also be victorious.

V. Basic Summary of Thirty Years

As mentioned above, the thirty years experienced by the Chinese Communist Party are glorious and great thirty years. This is thirty years in which the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have bravely fought against the imperialist aggressors and their running dogs, overcoming various opportunist tendencies and various errors and shortcomings in their own ranks through many difficulties and twists and turns, and finally defeating the enemy and achieving victory.

The history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that in order for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to defeat the rule of powerful imperialism and its running dogs and establish an independent people's democratic state, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, without a Bolshevik-style party like the Chinese Communist Party "with discipline, armed with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, adopting the method of self-criticism, and linked to the masses of the people" to take on the leadership, it would be impossible. Before the Chinese Communist Party, China had bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties that attempted to lead the Chinese revolution and had played a progressive role in history, but they all failed under the different methods of attack of the enemy. The attacks of imperialism and its running dogs encountered by the Chinese Communist Party were much more ferocious and serious than the attacks of any enemy encountered by the Chinese people in history, but the Chinese Communist Party was able to lead the people to victory because the Chinese Communist Party is a new type of proletarian revolutionary party established with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik) as a model.

At the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the main style of the Chinese Communist Party is the style of combining theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the masses of the people, and the style of self-criticism. Because of the combination of theory and practice, the Party can effectively and creatively apply the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, overcome the two deviations of dogmatism and empiricism, and find and establish the correct path to defeat the powerful enemy and build a new country. Because of the close connection with the masses of the people, the Party can lead the people's revolutionary struggle and revolutionary war, create the people's army and the people's power, and rely on the unlimited power of the masses of the people to defeat the enemy who once obviously had the upper hand. Because of self-criticism, the Party can learn lessons from past failures and mistakes, seek progress, and constantly maintain and improve its relationship with the masses. A party with this style is the most important guarantee for leading the Chinese revolution to its final victory.

The history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that the Party's correct leadership is first determined by the correct theory of the Chinese revolution. In order to lead the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to victory, it is impossible without the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In October 1939, when reviewing and summarizing the history of the Party during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

"The first stage is the young Party. In the early and middle stages of this stage, the Party's line was correct, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Party members and Party cadres was very high, so it won the victory of the First Great Revolution. However, the Party at this time was still a young Party after all. It was a Party that had no experience in the three basic issues of the united front, armed struggle, and Party building. It was a Party that did not understand or was not rich in its knowledge of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, the laws of the Chinese revolution, and the historical and social knowledge of the Chinese revolution. It was a Party that did not yet have a complete and unified understanding of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the ruling component in the Party's leading organs, at the end of this stage, at the critical juncture of this stage, failed to lead the entire Party to consolidate the victory of the revolution, accepted the deception of the bourgeoisie, and caused the revolution to suffer a defeat. In this stage, the Party's organization developed, but it was not consolidated. It failed to consolidate the Party members, Party cadres, and Party organizations ideologically and politically. There were a large number of new Party members, but they were not given the necessary Marxist-Leninist education. There was also a lot of work experience, but it could not be summarized well. A large number of speculators infiltrated the Party, but they were not cleaned out. The enemy and the allies were plotting to harm our Party, but there was no vigilance. Many activists emerged in the Party, but there was not enough time to create the Party's backbone. The Party had a batch of revolutionary armed forces in its hands, but it could not grasp them. All these situations were due to a lack of experience, a lack of profound revolutionary understanding, and a lack of unified understanding between the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. This is the first stage of Party building. The second stage is the stage of the Ten-Year Civil War. Because of the experience of the first stage, because of a further understanding of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, the laws of the Chinese revolution, and the historical and social knowledge of China, and because of a further connection between the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, our Party was able to carry out the victorious Ten-Year Red Army War. Although the bourgeoisie had betrayed, the Party was able to rely closely on the peasants. The Party's organization was not only re-developed, but also consolidated. Although the enemy was harming our Party every day, the Party expelled the harmful elements. Not only did a large number of cadres re-emerge in the Party, but these cadres were also transformed into the Party's central backbone. The Party opened up the road of people's power, and therefore learned the art of governing the country and securing the people; the Party created a strong armed force, and therefore learned the art of war. All these are major progress and major success of the Party. However, some Party members fell or had fallen into the quagmire of opportunism in this great struggle. This was still because they did not humbly learn from past experience, did not understand the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, the laws of the Chinese revolution, lacked historical and social knowledge of China, and did not have a unified understanding between the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, a part of the Party's leading organs was unable to fully grasp the correct political line and organizational line at all times during this entire stage. The Party and the revolution were harmed by Li Lisan's "Left" opportunism at one time, and by "Left" opportunism in the revolutionary war and "Left" opportunism in the White Area work at another time. However, all this was defeated at the Zunyi Conference of the Party. After the Zunyi Conference (held in Zunyi, Guizhou in January 1935), the Party completely embarked on the Bolshevik road, laying the foundation for later defeating Zhang Guotao's Right opportunism and establishing the Anti-Japanese National United Front. This is the second stage of the Party's development process. The third stage of the Party's development process is the stage of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. This stage has passed three years, and the struggle of these three years is of very great significance. Relying on the experience of the past two revolutionary stages, relying on the Party's organizational strength and armed strength, relying on the Party's high political belief among the people of the whole country, and relying on the Party's deeper and more unified understanding of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, the Party not only established the Anti-Japanese National United Front, but also carried out the great War of Resistance Against Japan. The Party's organization has come out of the narrow circle and has become a large party in the whole country. The Party's armed forces have also been strengthened and further strengthened in the struggle against the Japanese invaders. The Party's influence among the people of the whole country has been further expanded." (Foreword to "The Communist")

Comrade Mao Zedong's vivid narrative of the Party's history fully illustrates the serious significance of revolutionary theory. Wrong theory can quickly lead a booming great revolution to failure, while correct theory can save the Party at the most difficult juncture and gradually lead the revolution to a climax.

The Chinese Communist Party was founded at the beginning under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is the advantage of the Chinese Communist Party. But in order to lead the Chinese revolution to victory, it is not enough to rely solely on the instructions of ready-made general principles. Comrade Mao Zedong's contribution lies in combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, as well as Lenin and Stalin's principled instructions on the Chinese revolution, with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and since this is the case, it cannot but give new development to Marxism-Leninism. In his report at the Second All-Russian Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East in November 1919, Lenin called on the communists of the Eastern peoples and said: "Here, before you, lies a task that has never been put before the world's communists before. This task is: Relying on the general theory and practice of communism, when you apply it to unique conditions that do not exist in European countries, you must be good at applying this theory and practice to such conditions, that is, the peasantry is the main mass, and the task of struggle to be solved is not against capital but against the remnants of the Middle Ages." It should be said that Comrade Mao Zedong and other Chinese Communists have correctly solved this historical task put forward by Lenin, and thus have advanced Marxism-Leninism.

When summarizing the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out more than once that the people's democratic united front led by the Party and the armed struggle, which is the main form of revolution, are the two basic experiences of the Chinese Communist Party in the process of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. The creation of these two experiences is an important example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution.

The thirty-year history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that the development of the Party and the development of the Chinese revolution are inseparable from the development of the Chinese people's democratic united front. When the Party correctly solves the problem of the working class's leadership in the people's democratic revolution, the problem of the worker-peasant alliance, and especially the problem of uniting or struggling with different bourgeois groups, the Party and the revolution will develop rapidly, and when these problems are treated incorrectly, the Party and the revolution will suffer setbacks.

Obviously, for such serious and complex problems, the Chinese Communist Party must engage in independent thinking based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and cannot rely on simply copying a certain foreign formula. For example, the "Left" opportunists in the Party during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War once used copying methods to demand that the Party regard the "intermediate camp" as the "most dangerous enemy" because they had never seen an "intermediate camp" that could accept the leadership of the working class. For another example, the Right opportunists in the Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan once used copying methods to demand that the activities of the Chinese Communists should "all pass through" the united front with Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk, because they had never seen a revolutionary regime under a reactionary central regime, which neither broke with the reactionary regime nor could maintain its independence and autonomy. Comrade Mao Zedong rejected these erroneous views and prescribed different policies for different allies at different times. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the Chinese bourgeoisie after 1927 was still divided into two different groups, the ruling big bourgeoisie or bureaucratic bourgeoisie group, and the squeezed and harmed middle bourgeoisie or national bourgeoisie group. The former group is the object of the Chinese revolution. Although some of them stood on the side of resisting Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they did not formally conclude a united front organization and program with the Chinese Communist Party, and they still extremely hated the Communist Party and the people. Therefore, the Communists must never "all pass through" them, but must implement a high degree of independence and autonomy in the united front. The latter group is a weak and wavering force, which has contradictions with the working class, but also has contradictions with imperialism, feudalism, and the big bourgeoisie. Therefore, it can be won over under certain conditions. As long as the working class has firm revolutionary policies and appropriate organizational steps, and has unity and struggle with them, they can more or less attach themselves to the working class and fulfill their unfinished historical role, and will not become the "most dangerous enemy". Facts have proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's policy has overthrown the rule of the big bourgeoisie, that is, the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, and united the national bourgeoisie as a member of the people's democratic united front; here, it is clear that Comrade Mao Zedong is correct, not the "Left" and Right opportunists.

The thirty-year history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that the development of the party and the development of the Chinese revolution are inseparable from the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. Comrade Stalin said: "In the past, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, revolutions always began in this way: usually the people, mostly unarmed or poorly armed, rose up, clashed with the army of the old regime, and tried to disintegrate the army of the old regime, or at least partially pull it over to their side. This was the typical form of the outbreak of past revolutions. This was the case with us in Russia in 1905. In China, things are different. In China, it is not the unarmed people, but the armed people, that is, the revolutionary army, who rise up against the army of the old government. In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution. The special significance of the Chinese revolutionary army also lies in this." ("On the Future of the Chinese Revolution") This view of Comrade Stalin was extremely richly developed by Comrade Mao Zedong in theory and practice. In fact, since the Chinese Communists independently led the revolutionary war and the revolutionary army in August 1927, the Chinese Communist Party has never left the revolutionary war. Revolutionary war has become the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution, revolutionary armed organizations have also become the main form of organization in the Chinese revolution, and the advance and retreat of revolutionary war and the revolutionary army represent the advance and retreat of the Chinese revolution. In the many years of revolutionary war, all the main cadres of the Party lived a life of military communism, and the height of their revolutionary discipline and spirit of self-sacrifice is not easily imagined by many Communists who live a peaceful life.

On the strategic issues of the Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong made outstanding contributions to the Marxist-Leninist military theory, and these contributions, like contributions in other areas, are the result of a resolute struggle by true Marxism-Leninism against dogmatism. For example, dogmatists, ignoring the enlightenment of Comrade Stalin, insisted on preparing for urban uprisings as the focus of the Party's work for four or five years after 1927. Later, after the idea of urban uprisings caused serious damage to the Party's organization and was shattered by facts, dogmatists imposed the idea of positional warfare on the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in 1934, the result of which was that the Red Army was forced to withdraw from its original base areas. In contrast to the dogmatists, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the practice of the Chinese revolution after 1927, first created the method of surrounding cities from rural areas to replace the method of urban leadership of rural areas under normal conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong created the method of guerrilla warfare and movement warfare with guerrilla characteristics to guide the Red Army war, which was at an absolute disadvantage compared to the enemy in terms of quantity and equipment. Facts have proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of surrounding cities from rural areas has been completely victorious, and the Red Army, developed from guerrilla warfare, has finally grown into a powerful People's Liberation Army capable of positional warfare in victory. Here, it is clear that Comrade Mao Zedong is correct again, not the dogmatists.

When summarizing the Party's historical experience, Comrade Mao Zedong has also pointed out more than once the great significance of international assistance, especially Soviet assistance, in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's basic starting point for the theory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution is that after 1919, the Chinese revolution is an inseparable part of the world proletarian socialist revolution initiated by the Russian October Socialist Revolution, that is, the decisive influence of the Russian October Socialist Revolution on the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution has never been carried out in isolation and without assistance, but has been carried out under the constant inspiration, encouragement, and assistance of the Soviet Union and the international proletariat. The thirty-year history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that without the consistent and great assistance of the Soviet Union and the international proletariat, especially without the assistance of Lenin and Stalin and the Communist International they led to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, without the assistance of the Soviet army in eliminating Hitler in the West and annihilating the Japanese invaders and the Kwantung Army in the Northeast, and without the diplomatic, economic, and other assistance

　　中国共产党的三十年（之三）
      胡乔木
    一九四九年三月，党召集了第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议，决定了党对夺取全国胜利以及在全国胜利以后的基本政策。
    七届二中全会指出：在全国胜利的前夜，党的工作重心必须由乡村移到城市。从一九二七年以来，党的基本工作是在乡村聚集力量，用乡村包围城市，以便最后取得城市；现在这个任务已经完成了，党的工作重心应当移到城市，由城市来领导乡村。这次会议又指出：党在城市中的工作，必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，并将恢复和发展工业生产作为中心任务。这次会议曾经详细地讨论了中国经济各种成份的状况和党所应当采取的正确政策，这个讨论，后来构成了“共同纲领”中的经济政策的基础。
    这时，在国民党反动派方面，由于美帝国主义的授意，蒋介石假装下野，由李宗仁代替蒋介石出来要求“和平”。中国共产党并没有拒绝这个和平的要求，而且经过与国民党代表谈判以后，起草好了一个和平协定的草案。但是国民党反动派政府却拒绝签订和平协定，因而揭穿了它的假面具。
    毛泽东同志和朱德同志在一九四九年四月二十一日命令中国人民解放军向南方和西北进军，解放全中国一切尚未解放的地方。人民解放军在四月二十三日解放南京，接着在一九四九年内先后解放了太原、杭州、汉口、西安、上海、兰州、广州、贵阳、桂林、重庆、成都等各大城市和广大地区，并用和平办法解放了湖南、新疆、西康、云南等地。一九五○年四月和五月，人民解放军渡海解放了海南岛和舟山群岛。在南方和西南各省，在一九五○年剿灭了国民党所留下的一百六十万土匪。一九五○年十一月，人民解放军开始了向西藏进军。一九五一年五月，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府经过谈判，成立了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。这样，除台湾还被国民党反动派残余和美国侵略者盘据外，全国都解放了。
    从一九四六年七月到一九五○年六月，中国人民解放军先后消灭了国民党反动军队共八百零七万多人，缴获各种炮五万四千四百多门，各种机枪三十一万九千九百多挺，坦克和装甲车一千多辆，汽车二万多辆，以及其他大量的武器和装备。
    一九四九年十月一日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣告成立。中央人民政府是由中国各民族代表、各民主党派代表、各人民团体代表、各区域代表、各部队代表和特别邀请的民主人士共六百六十二人所组成的中国人民政治协商会议的选举产生出来的。中国人民政治协商会议在一九四九年九月二十一日至九月三十日举行第一届全体会议。在这个会议上通过了《中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领》、《中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法》、《中国人民政治协商会议组织法》，选举了毛泽东为中央人民政府主席，朱德、刘少奇、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、高岗为副主席，选举了中央人民政府委员会委员五十六人，决定了以北京为中华人民共和国的首都。中华人民共和国的成立，光荣地总结了中国人民一百多年来反帝国主义封建主义的奋斗，特别是中国人民二十八年来在中国共产党领导下的奋斗。
    中华人民共和国已经成立了。中国革命已经从此进入了一个新时期。全国的情况，与《新民主主义论》《论联合政府》发表的时期已经完全不同。需要在人民民主革命已经胜利的条件下说明这些问题：中华人民共和国究竟是一种什么性质的国家呢？在这个国家中的各个阶级以及各种经济成份的地位和相互关系如何呢？这个国家的前途如何呢？对于这些问题，毛泽东同志一九四九年七月一日的论文《论人民民主专政》，和中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所通过的《共同纲领》，作了完满的答复。
    毛泽东同志在《论人民民主专政》一文中，规定中华人民共和国的性质，是“工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。毛泽东同志解释这个公式的意义说：“人民是什么？在中国，在现阶段，是工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，这些阶级在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下，团结起来，组成自己的国家，选举自己的政府，向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。对于人民内部，则实行民主制度，给予言论集会结社等项的自由权。选举权，只给人民，不给反动派。这两方面，对人民内部的民主方面和对反动派的专政方面，互相结合起来，就是人民民主专政。”
    毛泽东同志反复指明中华人民共和国必然要学习苏联的榜样，走向社会主义和共产主义，并且现在就必须坚决地站在苏联一边，站在社会主义一边。但是中华人民共和国在现在的历史时期中仍然允许民族资产阶级存在。这是中国的人民民主和东南欧国家的人民民主的区别，这个区别是由不同的历史条件产生的。毛泽东同志写道：“民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。我们还有帝国主义站在旁边，这个敌人是很凶恶的。中国要实现经济上的真正的独立，还需要经过很长的时间。只有中国的工业发展了，中国在经济上不倚赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。中国的现代工业，在整个国民经济上的比重是很小的。现在还没有可靠的数目字，根据某些材料来估计，现代工业不过只占全国国民经济总生产量的百分之十左右。为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。我们现在的方针是节制资本主义，而不是消灭资本主义。”节制资本主义的过程，是一个与民族资产阶级有联合有斗争的过程，也就是一个改造民族资产阶级的过程。毛泽东同志说：“其他的剥削阶级已经打倒了，剩下一个民族资产阶级，在现阶段就可以向他们中间的许多人们进行许多适当的教育工作。等到将来实行社会主义即实行私人企业国有化的时候，再进一步对他们进行教育和改造的工作。人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反。”
    毛泽东同志关于中华人民共和国的基本观点，在《共同纲领》里面都以法律的形式确定下来了。《共同纲领》的总纲写道：“中华人民共和国为新民主主义即人民民主主义的国家，实行工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强而奋斗。”《共同纲领》有系统地规定了中国人民民主统一战线和中华人民共和国在目前时期对于政治、军事、经济、文化、民族、外交各方面的基本政策。这些政策，就是中国共产党在目前时期的基本政策。《共同纲领》关于经济政策特别作了详细的解说。《共同纲领》写道：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。国家应在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，调剂国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济，使各种社会经济成分在国营经济领导之下，分工合作、各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”这样，在《共同纲领》里，工人阶级在政治上的领导地位，工人阶级所掌握的社会主义性质的国家经济在经济上的领导地位，都得到了法律上的承认，而这种领导，正是中华人民共和国向社会主义发展的主要保证。
    中华人民共和国的成立，引起了全世界人民的欢呼。中国人民最忠实的国际友人苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，在一九四九年十月二日就宣布与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。保加利亚人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、波兰共和国、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、缅甸联邦、印度共和国、越南民主共和国、丹麦王国、瑞典王国、瑞士联邦、印度尼西亚共和国、芬兰共和国、巴基斯坦等国都与中华人民共和国相继建立了外交关系。英国、锡兰、挪威、以色列、阿富汗、荷兰等国都承认了中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国坚决地站在以苏联为首的世界和平阵营方面，并且努力加强中苏两国的友好关系。一九五○年二月十四日，在毛泽东主席和斯大林大元帅的直接参加之下，中苏两国由周恩来总理兼外长和维辛斯基外长在莫斯科签订了有历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏两国关于中长铁路、旅顺及大连的协定和中苏两国关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定。这些条约和协定，大大地加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，大大地帮助了新中国的国际地位和建设事业。
    中央人民政府成立以后，立即进行巨大的工作来恢复和改造被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义以及战争和灾荒所重重损害的经济。中央人民政府在没收了国民党的官僚资本以后所建立的社会主义性质的国家经济，在全国的经济生活中迅速发挥了伟大的力量。依靠国家经济的支持，中央人民政府迅速有效地统一了和平衡了国家的财政，终止了十二年来的恶性通货膨胀，并且有系统地进行了恢复工业生产、农业生产、交通事业和贸易事业的巨大工作。为了开辟市场和积累工业化所需要的资金，中央人民政府决定把经济工作的重点首先放在发展农业、轻工业和国内贸易上面，同时着手建立少数最切要的国防工业和动力工业。由于国家经济控制了全国的经济命脉，并具有高度的集中性，私人资本主义的工业和商业正在逐步地被引向服从国家经济领导的轨道，为国家经济服务的国家资本主义经济正在逐步发展。而工商业的这种适合国家需要的改组或调整，乃是准备有计划的工业建设所必要的。
    中央人民政府认定在全国施行土地改革，是改善全部经济状况、准备工业建设的主要条件之一。中央人民政府在一九五○年六月通过了中华人民共和国土地改革法，并且在一九五○年冬天到一九五一年春天，领导了新解放区的农民，完成了在一亿三千万人口地区的土地改革工作。由于战争已经基本上结束，中华人民共和国土地改革法在对待富农土地的问题上改变了一九四七年的中国土地法大纲中的规定，由征收富农多余土地的政策，改变为保存富农经济的政策，即仅在特定条件下征收富农出租的土地，对富农其余土地一律不动。这个新的政策，对于中农的生产积极性是一项重要的保障。目前全国土地改革工作，连老解放区在内，已在二亿九千万人口的地区完成，其余的地区也将在一两年内完成。土地改革工作，以及同时在全国进行的人民代表会议政权的建设工作，和由广大人民群众参加的大规模的镇压反革命破坏活动的工作，极大地巩固了人民民主专政的基础；没有这个基础，有计划的经济建设是不可能进行的。
    中国共产党注意到党的巩固在目前和将来的一切革命事业中的决定意义。党在人民解放战争胜利的年份有了迅速的扩大。中国共产党现在有党员五百八十万人。党决定在老区农村中一般地停止接收党员，而着重吸收产业工人入党。党决定在党员中认真地进行有系统的马克思列宁主义的教育，使每个党员彻底了解依靠工人阶级的必要和实现共产主义的必要，并且按照严格的标准对党的组织作一次认真的整理。
    中国人民在着手重建自己的国家的时候，并没有忘记帝国主义新侵略的威胁。不甘心于在中国这块土地上失败的美帝国主义者，果然在一九五○年六月，在武装干涉朝鲜的同时，公然霸占了中国的领土台湾省。美国对于台湾的掠夺，事实上只是美国政府对于中国人民解放战争的长期武装干涉的继续，和对于中华人民共和国的武装干涉的开端。美国的掠夺台湾，证明了美国对我国友好邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所发起的狂暴的武装干涉，乃是对我国的总的侵略计划的一部分。美国干涉者所以要支持“朝鲜的蒋介石”——李承晚傀儡集团向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻，原来就是为着模仿日本侵略者的老办法，先占领朝鲜，同时夺取台湾，而后占领东北。一九五○年十月，美国侵略军占领平壤，随即以大量陆军向北汹涌前进，直至中朝边境的鸭绿江边和图们江附近，严重威胁我国东北国境的安全。美国空军连续轰炸扫射我国东北边境的城市农村，使我国同胞生命财产不断遭受损失。全国人民忍无可忍，纷纷要求以志愿行动抗美援朝，保家卫国。中国共产党和中国各民主党派发表宣言，支持人民群众的这种爱国要求。这样，中国人民就以无比的热情，进行了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝的正义斗争。
    中国人民志愿军一九五○年十月下旬在朝鲜前线开始与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的结果，迅速转变了朝鲜人民反侵略战争所曾一度遭遇的危险局势，从朝鲜北部打退了美国侵略军的疯狂进攻，并给美国侵略军和李承晚伪军以严重损失。从那时到现在，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在一起，已经进行过五次战役，歼灭侵略军十九万三千余名，包括美国侵略军八万九千多人。遭受痛击的侵略军已被驱逐到朝鲜中部北纬三十八度线附近，侵略军总司令著名美国战争贩子麦克阿瑟也因屡次战败在一九五一年四月被撤职。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜不顾侵略军的疯狂轰炸破坏所造成的种种困难，英勇地帮助朝鲜人民反对美国侵略，引起了全中国、全朝鲜和全世界人民的欢呼，引起了全中国人民空前未有的爱国主义的高涨。中国的爱国人民，深信援助朝鲜、收复台湾、巩固国防的事业，不但是我国经济恢复和经济建设事业的重要保障，而且是世界和平事业的重要组成部分。如同反对蒋介石的人民解放战争已经得到胜利一样，中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争，也一定要得到胜利。
  五  三十年的基本总结
    如上所述，中国共产党所经历的三十年，乃是光荣的、伟大的三十年。这是中国共产党、中国工人阶级和中国人民在毛泽东同志领导下，向帝国主义侵略者及其走狗英勇奋斗，通过许多艰难曲折，克服自己队伍中的各种机会主义倾向和各种错误缺点，终于战胜敌人而取得胜利的三十年。
    中国共产党的历史证明：中国工人阶级和中国人民为要战胜强大的帝国主义及其走狗的统治，建立独立的人民民主国家，如毛泽东同志所说，没有中国共产党这样一个“有纪律的，有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的”布尔塞维克式的党来担任领导，就是不可能的。在中国共产党以前，中国曾经有过资产阶级的和小资产阶级的政党企图领导中国革命，并曾在历史上起过进步作用，但是他们都在敌人的不同方法的进攻下面失败了。中国共产党所遇到的帝国主义及其走狗的进攻，比中国人民在历史上所遇到的任何敌人的进攻更要凶恶严重得多，但是中国共产党能够领导人民达到胜利，这就是因为中国共产党是以苏联共产党（布尔塞维克）为模范而建立起来的新式的无产阶级的革命政党。
    在党的第七次全国代表大会上，毛泽东同志曾经指出中国共产党的主要作风，就是理论与实践相结合的作风，与人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风，和自我批评的作风。由于理论与实践相结合，党才能有效地和创造性地应用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，克服教条主义和经验主义两种偏向，找到并且确立战胜强大敌人和建设新国家的正确道路。由于与人民群众有紧密的联系，党才能领导人民的革命斗争和革命战争，创造人民的军队和人民的政权，依靠人民群众的无限力量来战胜曾经显然占优势的敌人。由于自我批评，党才能在历次的失败和错误中吸取教训，求得进步，并经常保持和改善与群众的联系。具有这种作风的党，乃是领导中国革命直至最后胜利的最重要的保证。
    中国共产党的历史证明，党的正确的领导，首先决定于对于中国革命的正确的理论。为要领导中国工人阶级和中国人民达到胜利，没有马克思列宁主义的指导，没有毛泽东思想的指导，是不可能的。
    在一九三九年十月，在回顾和总结第一次国内革命战争时期、第二次国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期党的历史的时候，毛泽东同志写道：
    “第一阶段是幼年的党。在这个阶段的初期与中期，党的路线是正确的，党员群众与党的干部的革命积极性是非常之高的，因此获得了第一次大革命的胜利。然而这时的党终究还是幼年的党，是在统一战线、武装斗争与党的建设三个基本问题上都没有经验的党，是对于中国革命的特点，中国革命的规律，中国革命的历史知识与社会知识都不懂得或不丰富的党，是对于马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之间还没有完整的、统一的了解的党。因此，党的领导机关中占统治地位的成份，在这一阶段的末期，在这一阶段的紧要关头中，没有能够领导全党巩固革命的胜利，接受了资产阶级的欺骗，而使革命遭受了失败。在这一阶段中，党的组织是发展了，但是没有巩固，没有能够使党员、党的干部、党的组织，在思想上、政治上巩固起来。新党员非常之多，但是没有给与必要的马克思列宁主义的教育。工作经验也不少，但是不能够很好的总结起来。党内混入了大批的投机分子，但是没有清洗出去。敌人与同盟者都在阴谋暗害我们的党，但是没有警觉性。党内涌出了很多的活动分子，但是没有来得及造成党的中坚骨干。党的手里有了一批革命武装，但是不能掌握住。所有这些情形，都是由于没有经验，缺乏深刻的革命认识，缺乏马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之统一的理解而来的。这就是党的建设的第一阶段。第二阶段，即十年内战的阶段。由于有了第一阶段的经验，由于对于中国革命的特点、中国革命的规律、中国的历史知识与社会知识的进一步的了解，由于对于马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之间有了进一步的联系，就使得我们党能够进行了胜利的十年红军战争。资产阶级虽然叛变了，但是党能够紧紧地依靠着农民。党的组织不但重新发展了，而且得到了巩固。敌人虽然天天在暗害我们的党，但是党驱逐了暗害分子，党内不但重新涌出了大批的干部，而且使这些干部变成了党的中心骨干。党开辟了人民政权的道路，因此也就学会了治国安民的艺术；党创造了坚强的武装部队，因此也就学会了战争的艺术。所有这些，都是党的重大进步与重大成功。然而，一部分党员在这个伟大斗争中跌下了或跌下过机会主义的泥坑，这仍然是因为他们不去虚心领会过去的经验，对于中国革命的特点、中国革命的规律不了解，对于中国的历史知识与社会知识太缺乏，对于马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之间，没有统一的理解而来的。因此，就使党的领导机关的一部分人，没有能够在这一整个阶段的一切时间中都完全的掌握住正确的政治路线与组织路线。党与革命在一个时间中是遭受过李立三左倾机会主义的危害，而在另一个时间中，又遭受过革命战争中的左倾机会主义与白区工作中的左倾机会主义的危害。然而这一切，是在党的遵义会议中所战胜了。及至遵义会议（一九三五年一月在贵州遵义开会）以后，党就彻底地走上了布尔塞维克的道路，奠定了后来战胜张国焘右倾机会主义与建立抗日民族统一战线的基础。这就是党的发展过程的第二个阶段。党的发展过程的第三个阶段，就是抗日民族统一战线的阶段。这个阶段，已经过去了三年，这三年的斗争，是有非常伟大的意义的。党凭借着过去两个革命阶段中的经验，凭借着党的组织力量与武装力量，凭借着党在全国人民中间的很高的政治信仰，凭借着党对于马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之更加深入的更加统一的理解，就不但建立了抗日民族统一战线，而且进行了伟大的抗日战争。党的组织已经从狭小的圈子中走了出来，变成了全国的大党。党的武装力量，也在同日寇的斗争中重新壮大起来与进一步坚强起来了。党在全国人民中的影响，更加扩大了。”（“共产党人”发刊词）
    毛泽东同志关于党的历史的生动的叙述，充分地说明了革命理论的严重意义。错误的理论，可以使轰轰烈烈的大革命迅速归于失败，而正确的理论，却在最困难的关头挽救党，使革命逐步地走向高潮。
    中国共产党一开始就是在马克思列宁主义一般原则的指导下成立的，这是中国共产党的优点。但是为要领导中国革命达到胜利，仅仅依靠现成的一般原则的指示却是不够的。毛泽东同志的贡献，就在于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，以及列宁斯大林关于中国革命的原则指示，与中国革命的具体实践相结合，而既然如此，就不能不给马克思列宁主义以新的发展。列宁在一九一九年十一月在东方各民族共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会上的报告中，向东方各民族的共产主义者发出号召说：“在这里，在你们面前摆着一个任务，这个任务从前在世界共产党人面前是没有提出过的，这个任务就是：依靠一般共产主义的理论和实践，你们在应用于欧洲各国所没有的独特条件时，须要善于把这个理论和实践应用于这样的条件，即农民是主要群众，所要解决的斗争任务不是反对资本而是反对中世纪的残余。”应当说，毛泽东同志和其他中国共产党人是正确地解决了列宁所提出的这个历史任务，并因而把马克思列宁主义推向前进了的。
    毛泽东同志在总结中国共产党的经验时，曾不止一次地指出：党所领导的人民民主统一战线，和作为革命主要形式的武装斗争，是中国共产党在中国人民民主革命过程中的两项基本经验。这两项经验的创造，就是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践之结合的重要例证。
    中国共产党的三十年历史证明，党的发展，中国革命的发展，是和中国人民民主统一战线的发展分不开的。当党在正确地解决工人阶级在人民民主革命中的领导权问题，工农联盟问题，特别是对不同的资产阶级集团实行联合或斗争的问题时，党和革命就得到了迅速的发展，而在错误地对待这些问题时，党和革命就遭受挫折。
    很明显，对于这样严重复杂的问题，中国共产党就必须根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践作独立的思考，而不能依靠于简单地抄袭某一外国的公式。例如党内的“左”倾机会主义者在第二次国内革命战争时期曾经用抄袭的方法要求党把“中间营垒”看作是“最危险的敌人”，因为他们没有看见过一种“中间营垒”可以接受工人阶级的领导。又例如党内的右倾机会主义者在抗日战争时期曾经用抄袭的方法要求中国共产党人的活动应当“一切经过”与蒋介石之流的统一战线，因为他们没有看见过一个反动的中央政权之下可以有一个革命政权，这个革命政权既不与反动政权破裂，而又可以保持自己的独立自主。毛泽东同志拒绝了这些错误的观点，而在不同时期对不同的同盟者规定了不同的政策。毛泽东同志指出中国资产阶级在一九二七年以后仍然是分为两个不同的集团，当权的大资产阶级或官僚资产阶级集团，和被排挤被损害的中等资产阶级或民族资产阶级集团。前一个集团是中国革命的对象，其中的一部分人在抗日战争期间虽曾站在抗日方面，但是与中国共产党并未正式缔结统一战线的组织和纲领，而且仍然极端仇视共产党和人民，所以共产党人决不能“一切经过”他们，而必须实行统一战线中的高度的独立自主。后一个集团是一个软弱的动摇的力量，与工人阶级有矛盾，但与帝国主义封建主义和大资产阶级也都有矛盾，因此是可以在一定条件下争取的，只要工人阶级有坚决的革命政策和适当的组织步骤，对他们有联合有斗争，他们就可以或多或少地依附工人阶级而尽其尚未完结的历史作用，并不成为“最危险的敌人”。事实证明，毛泽东同志的政策已经推翻了大资产阶级即官僚买办资产阶级的统治，而团结了民族资产阶级成为人民民主统一战线的一分子；在这里，正确的显然是毛泽东同志，而不是“左”右倾机会主义者。
    中国共产党的三十年历史证明，党的发展，中国革命的发展，又是和中国人民革命战争的发展分不开的。斯大林同志说：“从前，在十八和十九世纪，革命总是这样开始的：通常是大部分没有武装或武装很坏的人民举行起义，与旧政权的军队发生冲突，力谋瓦解旧政权的军队，或者至少部分地把它拉到自己方面来。这是过去革命爆发的典型形式。一九○五年我们俄国的情形就是这样。在中国，事情却不同了。在中国，不是那没有武装的人民，而是武装的人民，即革命军队，起来反对旧政府的军队。在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。中国革命的特点之一和优点之一就在于此。中国革命军队的特殊意义也在于此。”（《论中国革命的前途》）斯大林同志的这个观点，被毛泽东同志在理论上和实践上所极端丰富地发展了。事实上，从一九二七年八月中国共产党人独立地领导革命战争和革命军队以来，中国共产党就一直没有离开过革命战争。革命战争成了中国革命的主要斗争形式，革命的武装组织也成了中国革命的主要组织形式，革命战争和革命军队的进退，代表着中国革命的进退。在多年的革命战争中，党的全部主要骨干都过着军事共产主义的生活，其革命纪律性和自我牺牲精神之高，是许多过着和平生活的共产党人所不易想象的。
    在中国革命战争的战略问题上，毛泽东同志曾经对于马克思列宁主义的军事理论作了卓越的贡献，而这些贡献，和在其他方面的贡献一样，也是真正马克思列宁主义向教条主义作坚决斗争的结果。例如教条主义者曾经不顾斯大林同志的启示，在一九二七年以后四五年间坚持以准备城市起义为党的工作的重心。后来，在城市起义的思想造成了党的组织的严重破坏而为事实所粉碎以后，教条主义者又以阵地战的思想强加于一九三四年的中国工农红军，其结果是使红军被迫退出原有的根据地。与教条主义者相反，毛泽东同志在一九二七年以后的中国革命的实践中，首先创造了农村包围城市的方式来代替在通常条件下的城市领导农村的方式。毛泽东同志创造了游击战和带游击性的运动战的方式，来指导在数量上和装备上比较敌人居于绝对劣势的红军战争。事实证明，毛泽东同志的农村包围城市的方针已经完全胜利，而由游击战发展起来的红军，终于在胜利中生长为胜任阵地战的强大的人民解放军。在这里，正确的显然又是毛泽东同志，而不是教条主义者。
    在总结党的历史经验时，毛泽东同志又曾不止一次地指出了在中国革命中的国际援助首先是苏联援助的伟大意义。毛泽东同志关于中国新民主主义革命理论的基本出发点，就是在一九一九年以后，中国革命是俄国十月社会主义革命所开端的世界无产阶级社会主义革命的不可分的一部分，就是中国革命所受俄国十月社会主义革命的决定的影响。中国革命从来不是孤立无援地进行的，而是在苏联和国际无产阶级的不断启发、鼓励和援助之下进行的。中国共产党的三十年历史证明，没有苏联和国际无产阶级的始终一贯的伟大援助，特别是没有列宁斯大林及其所领导的共产国际在第一次国内革命战争时期对于中国共产党和中国人民的援助，没有苏联军在西方消灭希特勒，在东北歼灭日寇关东军的援助，没有中华人民共和国成立以后苏联政府给予中华人民共和国在外交上、经济上和其他多方面的援助，中国革命的今天的胜利，是不可能的。
    中国革命的胜利，给全世界工人阶级一种确信，给全世界殖民地半殖民地人民一种确信，就是伟大的十月社会主义革命所开始的世界工人阶级解放事业和世界殖民地半殖民地人民解放事业，必然要达到胜利。斯大林同志在一九一八年所写的《十月革命与民族问题》一文中曾描写十月革命的世界意义说：“十月革命的伟大世界意义，主要是在于：（一）它扩大了民族问题的范围，把民族问题从欧洲反对民族压迫斗争的局部问题，变为被压迫民族、殖民地半殖民地从帝国主义之下解放出来的总问题；（二）它给这一解放开辟了广大的可能性和真正的道路，这就大大地促进了西方和东方被压迫民族的解放事业，把他们吸引到胜利的反帝国主义的斗争的总轨道上去；（三）它从而在社会主义的西方和被奴役的东方之间架起了一道桥梁，建筑了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线。”三十三年前斯大林的伟大的预言，已经变为伟大的现实。而且由于中国革命的胜利，世界的东方已经建立了一个强大的革命的堡垒，这个堡垒经过苏联与东南欧各人民民主国家已经连成一片。毫无疑问，这将极大地鼓舞全世界劳动人民斗争的勇气和胜利的信心。
    帝国主义最后灭亡的日子快到了。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
