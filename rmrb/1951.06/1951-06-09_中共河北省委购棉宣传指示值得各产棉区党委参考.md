　　CCP Hebei Provincial Committee's Cotton Purchase Propaganda Instructions Worthy of Reference by Party Committees in All Cotton-Producing Areas
　　The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on cotton purchase propaganda, requiring Party committees in cotton-producing areas to widely and thoroughly publicize the significance of cotton purchase. The instructions stated: Party organizations should explain to Party members and farmers in cotton-producing areas the current difficulties in the state's cotton purchase; make it clear that selling cotton to the state or storing it in state-entrusted economic organizations is a concrete manifestation of loving the country, supporting the People's Government, supporting the Communist Party, supporting the People's Liberation Army, and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, and use accounting methods to explain to farmers that selling and storing cotton is beneficial to themselves and the country. It should be explained that Communist Party members in rural areas should not only actively lead and participate in agricultural production, but also lead farmers in implementing the Party's policy of mutual assistance between workers and peasants, constantly care about and assist the country's industrial construction, and that leading the masses to sell and store cotton is a concrete action to implement this policy. The instructions require rural branch committees in cotton-producing areas to immediately convene a special meeting on the issue of cotton sales and storage, study the amount of cotton stored in the village and the feelings of cotton farmers, and formulate methods to mobilize farmers to sell and store cotton; then convene a general meeting of all Party members and Communist Youth League members, calling on them to play a model role in cotton sales and storage. At the same time, they should also help the mass organizations in the village to formulate cotton sales and storage plans. Every Communist Party member and Communist Youth League member should first sell their own cotton to carry out propaganda with practical actions. Propaganda workers and dissemination stations in various districts and villages should give a special lecture to local propaganda workers on the issue of cotton sales and storage, instruct them on propaganda methods, assign propaganda tasks, and organize them to carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda. All wall newspapers and radio stations in rural areas should commend model figures and model deeds in the cotton sales and storage movement. Rural Party organizations should also use production gaps to hold small-scale forums for labor models, farmers, women, parents, and family members of revolutionary soldiers to publicize policies. All Party member cadres who have families in cotton-producing areas or relatives and friends in cotton-producing areas should write letters to their relatives and friends to mobilize them to sell and store cotton.
　　Editor's Note: It is entirely necessary for the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to issue timely propaganda instructions on cotton purchase. In cotton-producing areas, the Party's propaganda work should focus on promoting the patriotic cotton sales and storage movement as an urgent central task. The various methods stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Committee can be used as a reference for Party committees in all cotton-producing areas.

　　中共河北省委购棉宣传指示值得各产棉区党委参考
    中国共产党河北省委员会发出购棉宣传指示，要求产棉区的党委会广泛而深入地宣传购棉意义。指示说：党的组织应向产棉区的党员以及农民说明目前国家收购棉花中的困难情况；讲清楚把棉花售给国家或存在国家委托的经济机关，就是热爱国家、拥护人民政府、拥护共产党、拥护人民解放军、拥护中国人民志愿军的具体表现，并用算账的办法，向农民说明售棉、储棉是利自己、利国家的事情。应当说明，农村中的共产党员不但应积极领导和参加农业生产，还应领导农民贯彻党的工农互助政策，时时关心和协助国家的工业建设，而目前带领群众售棉、储棉，就是贯彻这个政策的具体行动。指示要求产棉区的农村支部委员会立即为售棉、储棉问题专门召开一次会议，研究本村的存棉数量及棉农的心情，订出动员农民售棉储棉的办法；然后召开全支部的党员大会及青年团员大会，号召他们在售棉、储棉中起模范作用。同时并应帮助本村的群众组织拟定售棉、储棉计划。每个中共党员及青年团员要首先卖出自己的棉花，以实际行动进行宣传。各区、村的宣传员、传授站，应就售棉、储棉问题专门向当地宣传员讲授一次，指示宣传办法，交给宣传任务，组织他们进行广泛而深入的宣传。农村中的一切壁报、广播台，均应表扬售棉、储棉运动中的模范人物与模范事例。农村中党的组织还应利用生产空隙，分别召开劳动模范、农民、妇女、家长、革命军人家属的小型座谈会，宣传政策。一切家在产棉区或产棉区有亲戚朋友的党员干部，应给亲友写信，动员他们售棉、储棉。
    编者按：中共河北省委及时发出关于购棉的宣传指示是完全必要的。在产棉区党的宣传工作应以推动爱国售棉、储棉运动为紧迫的中心任务，河北省委规定的各项办法可供各产棉区党委参考。
