The tragic life of Zhou Jinshun, a worker at the Wuhu Catholic Church, reflects the persecution and enslavement of ordinary Chinese Catholics by imperialist missionaries.

Zhou Jinshun is from Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, and his family has been Catholic for six generations. However, his father, who worked as a catechist for more than 30 years, was driven to his death by a French priest at the Jiujiang Catholic Church. When his father died, his mother asked the church to donate a few planks for a coffin, but even this small request was refused. His mother worked at the Jiujiang Mercy Hall for decades, but after his father's death, she was also expelled from the Mercy Hall.

Zhou Jinshun brought his wife from Jiujiang to Wuhu in 1947. He initially worked as a messenger at the Nei Si School for Girls, run by the Wuhu Catholic Church. Li Momo (a Spanish national), the person in charge of the school, took advantage of his poverty and forced him to accept the following conditions: no wages and no meals provided, only some "tips" from the students. During the summer vacation of that year, the "tips" given to the workers by the students were withheld by Li Momo, who only gave him two-tenths of it.

This limited "tip money" was quickly used up. During the summer vacation, his rice bin was empty, and life was very difficult. One day, Li Momo came to urge him to work, and he pleaded with Li Momo, saying, "I haven't eaten for two days. Can the school give me some wages?" She replied rudely, "No, we agreed in advance that there would be no wages. If you don't want to do it, get out. I'll find someone else." At this time, Zhou Jinshun was filled with grief and indignation. He thought: Foreign priests usually say, "Catholics all over the world are one family," why do they treat me like this? He felt lonely and helpless, and the thought of ending his life arose. He banged his head against the wall, but fortunately, his wife stopped him, and he did not succeed in committing suicide.

Li Momo, fearing that someone would die, introduced Zhou Jinshun to the Catholic Church next door to do odd jobs, with a monthly salary of five dou of rice; but he still had to work part-time at the school. That is to say: five dou of rice a month, working in two places.

In 1948, Zhou Jinshun's first child was born. One night, his child's head was injured in a fall. The next day was the birthday of the Spanish bishop of the Wuhu diocese, and he was urged to go to the church early to serve. His wife waited for him outside the church with the child, hoping he could find a way to get medical treatment. He waited with great difficulty until a mass was over, and when he ran out to take a look, the child's head was swollen like a dipper. He hurriedly took the child to a Spanish doctor named He Dening at the Catholic Church Hospital. Dr. He only examined the child briefly and said, "I can't cure this child's illness, you find your own way." The child did not receive treatment and died that day.

Zhou Jinshun lost his beloved child and was extremely grieved and indignant. He went to Bishop Pu Lu, a Spanish national, to complain about Dr. He. The bishop said, "Just let it go if he died, this is all God's will. You like the child, but God likes him even more, he has gone to heaven."

After the liberation of Wuhu in 1949, the Spanish priest, under the pretext of financial difficulties, reduced his monthly salary of five dou of rice by two dou. Soon after, the church dismissed him altogether.

This Catholic, who had suffered all kinds of oppression and enslavement by imperialist elements within the church, experienced the wickedness of imperialist elements from his own life. Therefore, when patriotic Catholics in Wuhu initiated a self-reliance and renovation movement, he enthusiastically expressed his support and actively participated in the movement.

　　一个天主教徒的悲惨身世
      敏如
    芜湖天主教会工友周金顺的悲惨身世，反映了中国一般天主教徒受帝国主义传教士迫害和奴役的情况。
    周金顺是江西九江人，六代都是天主教徒。但是他的做了三十多年传教员的父亲，是被九江天主堂的法籍神父逼死的。他父亲死时，他母亲要求教堂施舍几块薄板做棺材，这一点点要求也被拒绝了。他的母亲在九江仁慈堂做了几十年的工，到他父亲死后，也就被仁慈堂驱逐了。
    周金顺是在一九四七年带了妻子从九江到芜湖的。他最初在芜湖天主堂办的女内思学校当传达。该校负责人李嬷嬷（西班牙籍）利用他的穷困，强制他接受这样的条件：没有工钱，也不供伙食，只拿些学生的“赏钱”。这年暑假，学生们发给工友的“赏钱”被李嬷嬷扣下，只给了他十分之二。
    这笔有限的“赏金”很快就用完了。暑假里，他家的米桶空空，生活非常困难。一天，李嬷嬷来催他做工，他向李嬷嬷哀求说：“我已两天没有吃饭了，学校里能不能发点工钱？”她粗暴地回答道：“不行，我们事先讲好没有工钱，你不干就滚蛋，我另外找人。”这时的周金顺真是悲愤交集，他想道：外国教士平时口口声声地说：“天下教友是一家”，为什么这样对待我呢？他感到孤独无助，不禁萌了厌世之念，便用头向墙上猛撞，幸亏他的妻子阻住，没有自杀成功。
    李嬷嬷怕闹出人命来，于是将周金顺介绍到隔壁天主堂去做杂役，每月工资五斗米；但是仍要他在学校里兼差。这就是说：一月五斗米，两头做工。
    一九四八年，周金顺的第一个孩子出世了。一天晚上，他孩子的头部跌伤了，第二天是芜湖教区西班牙籍主教的生日，他一早就被催着到教堂里去伺候了。他的老婆抱着孩子在教堂外面等他设法去诊治。他好容易等着做完一台弥撒，跑出去一看，孩子的头已肿得像巴斗一样。他急忙抱了孩子去找天主堂医院一个名叫何德凝的西班牙籍医生，何医生只替孩子略略诊察了一下，便说：“这孩子的病我医不好，你们自己想法子去。”孩子得不到医治，便在当天死去了。
    周金顺失去了可爱的孩子，痛愤已极，到西班牙籍主教蒲卢那里去告何医生。这个主教却说：“死了就算了，这都是天主安排的意思。你喜欢孩子，天主更喜欢他，他进天堂去了。”
    一九四九年芜湖解放以后，西班牙籍神父借口经费困难，将他的一月五斗米工资减去两斗。不久，教堂更将他辞退了。
    这个受尽了教会内帝国主义分子压迫和奴役的天主教徒，从实际生活中体验到帝国主义分子的可恶，因此当芜湖市爱国的天主教徒发起自立革新运动时，他热烈地表示拥护，并积极地参加了这一运动。（新华社）
