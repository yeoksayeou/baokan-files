The CPC Handan Prefectural Committee, after seeing the instructions and calls from the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding cotton purchase and storage work, believes that this is a major matter concerning national economic construction and the lives of the military and civilians. It expresses its firm support and resolute implementation. To promote the Party members and Communist Youth League members throughout the entire region to lead the vast cotton farmers in launching a patriotic cotton sales and storage movement, it issued an emergency instruction to Party committees at all levels on June 4th. The specific measures are as follows:

　　(1) The Party committees of all counties, towns, and mining areas should immediately convene meetings to discuss and study the instructions and calls from the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding this work. They should implement them level by level and organize a certain number of cadres to go to cotton-producing areas to hold cotton farmer symposiums and labor model symposiums by district to mobilize them. Through the exemplary role of Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models, and active elements, a patriotic cotton sales and storage competition should be launched.

　　(2) Further deepen the publicity of the significance of patriotic cotton sales and storage, mobilize Party reporters and propagandists, and use various propaganda institutions to publicize to cotton farmers, explaining that selling or storing cotton for the country to supply the textile industry is a practical manifestation of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

　　(3) All Party and non-Party organizations should be mobilized around this central task. Cooperatives, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and armed forces departments should all issue calls to their members and militiamen to sell and store cotton. All specialized companies, cooperatives, the People's Bank of China, and tax departments should, under the direct leadership of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Finance and Economics Committee, unify their steps, carry out cotton purchase work, and must not allow disputes over profits and procedures to affect the completion of the task. In addition to ensuring the supply of materials to cotton farmers, specialized companies should also send a portion of their cadres to the countryside to provide specific assistance in this work. Each county should establish a joint cotton purchase office, led by the finance and economics office.

　　(4) All localities should immediately start work and launch comprehensive publicity and mobilization. Each county should first conduct key experiments with cadres, and then fully deploy. Combine this with the summer grain collection and seize the opportunity to launch a concentrated effort before the summer grain collection, striving to substantially complete the task by the end of July and fully complete it by August.

　　中共邯郸地委号召
    开展爱国售棉竞赛
    中共邯郸地方委员会见到中央人民政府政务院、中国共产党中央委员会和河北省人民政府、中共河北省委关于购棉、储棉工作的指示和号召后，认为这是关系国家经济建设和军民生活的大事情，表示坚决拥护并坚决贯彻执行。为推动全专区的党员、青年团员带动广大棉农展开爱国售棉储棉运动，在六月四日向各级党委发出紧急指示。具体措施如下：
    （一）各县、镇、矿区党委立即开会讨论研究中央人民政府政务院、中国共产党中央委员会和河北省人民政府、中共河北省委关于这一工作的指示和号召，逐级贯彻，并组织一定干部分别到产棉地区，以区为单位召开棉农座谈会、劳动模范座谈会进行动员，通过党员、青年团员、劳动模范及积极分子的模范作用，展开爱国主义售棉、储棉竞赛。
    （二）进一步深入宣传爱国售棉、储棉的意义，发动党的报告员、宣传员，通过各种宣传机构向棉农进行宣传，说明把棉花卖给或存给国家，供应纺织工业生产用棉，就是抗美援朝爱国的实际表现。
    （三）一切党与非党组织都应围绕这一中心任务动员起来。合作社、工会、青年团、妇联会及武装部门，都要向自己的会员、社员和民兵发出售棉和储棉的号召。各专业公司、合作社、人民银行和税收部门，要在专署财政经济委员会的直接领导下，统一步调，开展购棉工作，不得因利润、手续等发生纠纷，影响任务的完成。各专业公司，除要保证棉农物资的供应以外，还要抽出一部分干部下乡，具体帮助进行这一工作。各县要以财经办公室为主，建立联合购棉办公室。
    （四）各地应立即进入工作，展开全面的宣传动员；各县要抽出干部先作重点试验，随即全面展开。结合夏征和抓紧在夏征前进行突击，争取在七月底大体完成，八月份全数完成。
