Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 27th. The General Secretary of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada, Buck, cabled congratulations on behalf of the National Committee of the Party on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The cable reads as follows:

    On this glorious anniversary of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the victorious Communist Party of China, please accept the fraternal and enthusiastic greetings of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada. Peace-loving progressives in Canada are keenly aware of a historical truth: that the 475 million independent and free people under the leadership of the government of the People's Republic of China are a powerful force in defending world peace. Thanks to the wise leadership and self-sacrificing struggle of the Communist Party of China, China has transformed itself from a servant of predatory imperialism into an invincible fighter for peace, democracy, and a better life for the people of all countries. We know that the great Chinese people most desire to maintain peace and friendship with the people of Canada and the world. We reaffirm that the Canadian people do not want to fight China but advocate that the St. Laurent government recognize People's China and advocate that your country obtain its rightful place in the United Nations. China's great contribution to the world's struggle for peace alongside the Soviet Union is one of the main guarantees that the people of all countries will be able to convene a conference of the five major powers to discuss a solemn peace treaty. Peace will prevail. The peace-loving people of Canada extend warm greetings to you. Long live the friendship between the people of Canada and China! We pay the highest respect to your great party which is leading the Chinese people in building a new life of peace and happiness.

　　加拿大劳工进步党
    电贺中国共产党成立三十周年
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克代表该党全国委员会电贺中国共产党三十周年纪念，电文如下：
    值此光荣的与胜利的中国共产党成立三十周年纪念日，请接受加拿大劳工进步党兄弟般的热忱敬礼。爱好和平的加拿大进步人士都敏锐地觉察到一个历史真理，即在中华人民共和国政府领导下的四亿七千五百万独立和自由的人民，是保卫世界和平的强大力量。由于中国共产党的英明领导和自我牺牲的斗争，中国自掠夺性的帝国主义的仆从的地位，变成了为全世界各国人民争取和平、民主和美好生活的不可战胜的战士。我们知道，伟大的中国人民最希望与加拿大和世界各国人民保持和平和友谊。我们重新声明，加拿大人民不愿对中国作战，而主张圣劳伦政府承认人民中国，并主张贵国取得在联合国中的应得地位。中国站在苏联一起对世界争取和平斗争的巨大贡献，是世界各国人民必能做到召开五大国会议来讨论庄严的和平公约的主要保障之一。和平必将得胜。爱好和平的加拿大人民谨向你们致热烈的敬礼。加、中两国人民的友谊万岁！谨向领导中国人民进行建设和平和幸福的新生活的你们伟大的党，致以最高的敬意。
        蒂姆·布克（签字）
