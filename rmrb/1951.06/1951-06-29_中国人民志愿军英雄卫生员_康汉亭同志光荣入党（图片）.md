    (1) Comrade Kang Hanting is a model sanitary worker of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism in the battle to defend Zhongyuan Mountain.

    (2) At the beginning of the Zhongyuan Mountain battle, he requested the instructor to go to the front line of the position to rescue the wounded. He braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire and rescued more than twenty lightly and seriously wounded soldiers from the front lines.

    (3) When the battle of Zhongyuan Mountain was at its most intense, the enemy charged up. Comrade Kang Hanting immediately picked up the gun of a comrade who had already sacrificed and annihilated the enemy, acting as a brave fighter. He thought: "The wounded are important, but the position is even more important. If the position is secure, the wounded will be safe."

    (4) After the victory in the battle of Zhongyuan Mountain, at the merit evaluation and model selection conference, the brave and decisive Comrade Kang Hanting was selected as a special-class meritorious person and awarded the title of "Heroic Sanitary Worker"; and he was approved as a full member of the Communist Party of China. When joining the Party, he swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: to win greater victories in battle to repay the Party and the people for their expectations of him.
