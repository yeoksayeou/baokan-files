To the Editor:

The phenomenon of projects not meeting standards is also seriously present in the water conservancy projects of Xuancheng Prefecture in southern Anhui. In the polder areas of Dangtu, Nanling, Xuancheng, and Langxi counties of Xuancheng Prefecture, flood prevention preparations began in early May. Flood control headquarters at the prefectural and county levels were successively established in May, and flood control organizations at the district and village levels have also been established. On May 14th, the Dagong Polder in Dangtu County began wave barriers, and mobilized 1,484 laborers from 13 villages to drive in 2,265 piles. The polder areas in Xuancheng County generally launched a campaign to cherish the dikes and donate materials, and Baofeng Polder conducted flood prevention drills. Other polder areas are also widely promoting the "earth ox" method. The People's Government has issued over 930,000 jin of rice as flood prevention loans to various counties to solve the problem of flood prevention materials for farmers. All counties are actively purchasing flood prevention materials. Some cadres and the masses believe that there will be no flood prevention problems this year, and a mentality of 麻痹 (carelessness) has arisen. However, the Prefectural Water Conservancy Committee, with the assistance of the Southern Anhui Water Conservancy Engineering Office and in coordination with technical cadres from various counties, spent twenty days in May conducting key inspections of spring construction in various counties. A total of 20 dams, 47 polders, 16 ponds, and 1 river dike were inspected. The inspections revealed that, apart from the general river dikes and major repair polders and key repair polders being in relatively good condition, there were many problems with the general polder ponds and dike revetment work. A 300-meter section of the Xiongbao Polder on the Yijiang River bank in Nanling County is still a sand dike, and the "earth ox" is also made of sandy soil. Large clods of earth in the Taifeng Polder have not been broken up, and there are instances of inflated achievements. Of the 120 ponds and dams built with loan grain in Guangde County, only a dozen were personally supervised by engineering personnel, so most of them do not meet standards. Of the seven ponds and dams built with loan grain in Nanling, four were not surveyed. In Xuancheng County, the Shenggong Polder in the Xizhen Street area of the town is in serious danger, and the river water in the Sanyi Hengjie area will leak when it is less than three meters below the top of the levee.

We believe that the above problems are very serious, because "an inch of dike not being secure renders ten thousand zhang useless." We must strive to ensure that no problems occur during this year's flood season in order to guarantee the completion of this year's production increase task.

### 皖南宣城专区许多水利工程不合标准

    皖南宣城专区许多水利工程不合标准编辑同志：
    工程不合标准的现象，在皖南宣城专区的水利工程中，也是严重存在着。宣城专区当涂、南陵、宣城、郎溪等县圩区，自五月上旬即开始防汛准备工作，专区及各县防汛指挥部均于五月间相继成立，区村防汛组织也已成立。当涂县大公圩五月十四日开始了挡浪，并发动十三个村一千四百八十四个民工打下桩木二千二百六十五根。宣城县圩区普遍发起爱堤献物运动，保奉圩进行了防汛演习，其它圩区也在广泛推土牛。人民政府为解决农民防汛器材，发放给各县防汛贷粮大米九十三万余斤。各县都在积极购置防汛器材。有的干部和群众认为今年防汛无问题，产生麻痹思想。但是专区水利委员会，经皖南水利工程处协助，和各县技术干部配合，五月份以二十天的时间，到各县进行了春工重点检查。计重点检查了坝二十座、圩四十七个、塘十六个、河堤一道，经检查除一般江河圩堤大修圩及重点修圩较好外，一般圩塘及堤圩护岸工作，存在很多问题。南陵弋江岸熊保圩段三百公尺还是沙堤，土牛也是沙土；泰丰圩大土块都未打碎；并发现有浮报成绩现象。广德县贷粮兴修的塘坝一百二十个，但是工程人员亲自掌握的只有十余处，因此大部不合标准。南陵贷粮兴修的七处塘坝，四处就未勘测。宣城县沈公圩西河镇街市内，险象严重，三益横街河水距堤岸顶三公尺以下就会漏水。
    我们认为以上问题是很严重的，因为圩堤“一寸不牢，万丈无用。”必须争取作到今年汛期不发生问题，以保证今年增产任务的完成。
