　　On the Front Lines of Defending World Peace
            Asian Countries' Peace Movement Continues to Expand
    The movement to demand the conclusion of a peace treaty and oppose the rearmament of Japan continues to expand in Asian countries. The Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Committee decided to actively carry out a signature campaign from June 25th to August 7th. During this period, various peace gatherings, conferences, exhibitions, and speeches will be held. The Standing Committee also decided to organize 10,000 local committees in enterprises, schools, and other institutions, and stipulated that a Japanese Peace Conference be held on August 15th. During the signature campaign, the Peace Committee received signatures from many celebrities and cultural figures. The signature campaign in Vietnam is also progressing enthusiastically. By the end of April, more than 1.04 million people in North Vietnam had participated in the signature campaign. The Burma World Peace Congress officially began on May 12th to launch a signature campaign demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty and opposing the rearmament of Japan. Signature work has begun in various towns and villages in Indonesia, and many Indonesian political figures have taken the lead in signing.

    The people of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have expressed warm support for the Soviet government's proposals regarding the Japanese peace treaty issue. Talks by prominent Japanese figures such as Takakusa Junji, Korean public opinion, and statements by spokespersons of the Vietnamese government's Foreign Ministry all expressed firm opposition to the American aggressors' conspiracy to turn Japan into a base for aggression against Korea, China, and Asia.
            Chinese and German People Unite in Friendship to Defend World Peace
    In order to further enhance the German people's understanding of the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and to strengthen the friendship between the German and Chinese people, the National Front of Democratic Germany initiated the "German-Chinese Friendship Month." The opening conference was held in Berlin on the 8th of this month. The Chinese People's Representative Delegation, headed by Shen Junru, has arrived in Berlin to participate in the conference and has been warmly welcomed by the German people.

    The National Front of Democratic Germany will compile and print six million copies each of propaganda materials and pictorials introducing New China, as well as hundreds of thousands of pamphlets, and distribute them to the vast urban and rural population of Germany. After the start of the Friendship Month, the Chinese People's Representative Delegation will report on the situation in New China in various parts of Democratic Germany. During the Friendship Month, a German-Chinese Friendship Association will be established in Berlin.

    The holding of the German-Chinese Friendship Month will have a significant effect on strengthening the unity of our people with the German people, on strengthening the unity of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and on the cause of defending world peace. We sincerely wish that the friendship between the Chinese and German people will grow day by day.
            German People's Vote Achieves Victory
    The people's vote held in the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Sector of Greater Berlin from June 3rd to 5th was a new climax in the German people's movement against remilitarization. According to preliminary statistics, out of 13,034,477 valid votes, 95.98 percent gave affirmative answers to the question: "Are you against German remilitarization and do you demand the conclusion of a treaty with Germany within 1951?" According to incomplete statistics, 92.8 percent of the people in West Germany and the Western sectors of Berlin also voted against remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a treaty.

    The people's vote movement has made all German people realize that the United States' intensified rearmament of West Germany foreshadows the imminent arrival of new war disasters. The victory of the people's vote proves that the German people have united as one and are determined to fight against remilitarization and for the conclusion of a treaty.

　　在保卫世界和平战线上
            亚洲各国和平运动继续扩展
    要求缔结和平公约与反对武装日本的运动在亚洲各国继续扩展。日本拥护和平委员会常任委员会决议，自六月二十五日至八月七日积极开展签名运动，在这一期间将举行各种和平集会，组织各种大会，展览会与演讲等。常任委员会并决定在各企业、学校与其他机关中组织一万个地方委员会，并规定八月十五日举行日本和平大会。在签名运动中，和平委员会收到很多名流和文化界人士的签名。越南的签名运动也正在热烈展开。到四月底止，北越已有一百零四万多人参加了签名。缅甸拥护世界和平大会于五月十二日正式开始发动要求缔结和平公约与反对武装日本的签名运动。印尼的各城镇和乡村已经开始了签名工作，许多印尼的政治人物都带头签了名。
    对于苏联政府发表的关于对日和约问题的建议，日本、朝鲜和越南的人民都表示热烈拥护。日本知名人士高寻纯夫等的谈话，朝鲜的舆论和越南政府外交部发言人的声明，都表示坚决反对美国侵略者把日本变成侵略朝鲜、中国和亚洲的基地的阴谋。
            中德人民团结友好保卫世界和平
    为了使德国人民进一步认识中国人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，并加强德中人民的友谊，民主德国全国阵线发起举行“德中友好月”。开幕大会已于本月八日在柏林举行。以沈钧儒为首的我国人民代表团已经到达柏林参加大会，并且受到德国人民的热烈欢迎。
    民主德国全国阵线将编印介绍新中国的宣传品及画报各六百万份，小册子数十万份，散发给德国广大城乡人民。我国人民代表团在友好月开始后将到民主德国各地报告新中国的情况。在友好月期间，柏林将成立德中友好协会。
    德中友好月的举办，对于加强我国人民与德国人民的团结，对于加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的团结，对于保卫世界和平的事业，将有重大作用。我们谨祝中德人民友谊日益增进。
            德国人民投票获得胜利
    德意志民主共和国与大柏林民主区于六月三日至五日举行的人民投票，是德国人民反对重新军国主义化运动的新高潮。据初步统计结果，一千三百零三万四千四百七十七张有效票中，百分之九十五·九八都对“你是否反对德国重新军国主义化并要求在一九五一年内缔结对德和约？”的问题作了肯定的答复。而在西德和柏林西区进行的人民投票，据不完全的统计，也有百分之九十二·八的人民投票反对重新军国主义化和要求缔结和约。
    人民投票运动，已使全德国人民认识到美国加紧武装西德，就预示新的战争灾祸又要来临。人民投票的胜利证明：德国人民已经团结一致，坚决为反对重新军国主义化与缔结和约而斗争。
