　　Central Huai River Inspection Group
    Completes Inspection of Upper and Middle Reaches of Huai River

    The Central Huai River Inspection Group has completed its inspection of various Huai River control projects in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River, and will proceed to northern Jiangsu on May 30 to inspect the projects in the lower reaches of the Huai River.

    During the Inspection Group's nearly one-month stay in the Huai River basin, they successively inspected the Sui River dredging project in northeastern Anhui, the three valley reservoirs of Baisha, Shimantan, and Banqiao, and the Na Wangpo (i.e., Lao Wangpo) depression flood storage project in Henan Province, as well as the Runheji flood storage project in northern Anhui Province. During the inspection process, in addition to expressing deep condolences to the laborers and cadres at various construction sites, the Inspection Group widely conveyed Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's determination to thoroughly harness the Huai River, as well as their concern for the people in the Huai River basin, thus greatly boosting the working enthusiasm of all laborers and cadres. The Huai River control laborers and cadres have expressed to the Inspection Group that they will respond to Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's concern for them with redoubled efforts. They requested the Inspection Group to report their determination to "definitely fix the Huai River" to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

　　中央治淮视察团
    视察淮河上中游完毕
    中央治淮视察团已将淮河上游及中游的各项治淮工程视察完毕，五月三十日起赴苏北视察淮河下游的工程。
    视察团到达淮河流域将近一个月来，先后视察了皖东北的濉河疏浚工程，河南境内的白沙、石漫滩、板桥等三个山谷水库和赧王坡（即老王坡）洼地蓄洪工程，以及皖北境内的润河集蓄洪工程等。视察团在视察过程中，除向各个工地的民工和干部们进行了深切的慰问外，并广泛地传达了毛主席和中央人民政府根治淮河的决心，以及对于淮河流域人民的关怀，因而大大地鼓舞了全体民工和干部的工作热情。治淮民工和干部们纷纷向视察团提出要以加倍的努力，来回答毛主席和中央人民政府对他们的关切。他们要求视察团把他们“一定要把淮河修好”的决心报告给毛主席和中央人民政府。
