We Constantly Break New Excavation Records and Receive Glorious Happiness Under the Leadership of the Party
-- Letter from Ma Liuha, Lian Wanlu, Advanced Workers of Datong Coal Mine

Dear Chairman Mao:

In order to welcome the 30th anniversary of the Party, we are joyfully carrying out the patriotic production increase movement.

In the old society, we, these motherless children, were arbitrarily bullied by foremen and capitalists. Our family's life could never be sustained, without clothes or quilts, without mats on the kang. "The crows of the world are generally black," no matter where you go, you can't escape this painful situation.

We will never forget 1949, when you and the Party led the People's Liberation Army, defeated Chiang Kai-shek, and saved us from the fire pit, making us the masters of the country. I (Ma Liuha) am now elected as an executive committee member of the miners' union, the city's trade union, and the provincial trade union. I am very happy because my responsibility is even greater. When I attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, I met you and was personally entertained by you. A "coal miner" eating with the Chairman of the Central People's Government, this is something we have never heard of before, nor have we ever dreamed of. Our lives have also greatly improved. We eat white flour and rice, and in addition to the clothes we wear, we also have several sets stored away. The kang not only has mats, but also mattresses and blankets. This year, the province also awarded each of us a radio and sent each of us a portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. We hung your and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's portraits in the center, and also installed the radio. There is also a large clock hanging on the wall. This is the home of the workers under the leadership of the Communist Party. Living such a happy life, enjoying such high honor and respect, how can we not support you, how can we not support the Communist Party!

In order to commemorate the Party's birthday, we have formulated a practical action plan: to excavate three hundred meters in June. We have reported this plan to you. Under the leadership and support of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the entire mine, and with the help of technical personnel, we have overfulfilled this plan in the first half of the month (thirteen days). The original plan was to excavate one hundred and fifty meters in half a month, but we actually excavated one hundred and fifty-nine point seven meters, exceeding the original plan by six percent, and exceeding the original quota by eighty-six point three percent. In addition, we saved forty-seven shells and fourteen detonators.

June 19th can be said to be our happiest day. On this day, all three shifts in our group simultaneously set new records. Our shift (three people) advanced five meters and five, Qiu Deyi's shift (four people) advanced seven meters, and all three shifts advanced a total of eighteen meters and thirty-three centimeters. To celebrate our victory, the labor union also specially sent a film crew to show us a movie.

We are very clear that without the victory on the Korean front, there would be no happiness and security for us, and of course, there would be no talk of production and construction. Therefore, in addition to actively participating in the patriotic production increase competition, our entire group enthusiastically responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to donate airplanes and artillery: the entire group donated a total of 3.1 million yuan, of which the two of us each donated 600,000 yuan.

From the above, we have achieved some results in production. But the achievement of these results should first be attributed to your and the Party's wise leadership, and to your and the Party's training and education of us. We feel that we are inadequate in all aspects. However, as soon as we think of you, we immediately increase our determination and courage. We dare to guarantee to you: we will always guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to use our brains, learn technology, unite all employees and technical personnel, and strive to overfulfill the production tasks for 1951, and to defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible. I wish you good health forever!

　　我们不断创造掘进新纪录在党领导下得到光荣幸福
    ——大同煤矿先进工人马六孩连万禄的信亲爱的毛主席：
    为了迎接党的三十周年纪念日，我们正在愉快地开展着爱国增产运动。
    在旧社会里，我们这些没娘的孩子，受到把头和资本家任意的欺侮。家里的生活始终不能维持，没衣没被，炕上没席子。“天下的老鸦一般黑”，任凭你走到那里，也脱不了这痛苦的处境。
    永远不能忘的一九四九年，你和党领导着人民解放军，打败了蒋介石，救我们出了火坑，使我们成为国家的主人翁。我（马六孩）现在被选为矿工会、市工会、省工会的执行委员，我很高兴，因为我的责任更大了。出席全国劳动模范代表会议时，见到了你，并受到了你亲自的招待。“窑黑子”和中央人民政府主席在一块吃饭，这是从来没有听到过的，也是我们做梦也没想过的。我们的生活也大大地改善了。吃的是白面、大米，衣服除穿了的，还存放着好几身。炕上不但有了席，而且有了褥子和毯子。今年省里又奖了我们每人一个收音机，送我们每人一幅朱总司令的像，我们把你和朱总司令的像挂到正中，把收音机也按装起来，墙上还挂了一个大钟。这就是共产党领导下工人的家。过着这样幸福的生活，享受着这样高的荣誉和尊敬，我们怎不拥护你，怎不拥护共产党！
    为了纪念党的生日，我们订了实际行动计划：六月份要掘进三百公尺。这个计划，我们已报告过你。在全矿党、政、工、团的领导和支持下，在技术人员的帮助下，上半月（十三天），我们已经超额完成了这个计划。原计划半月掘进一百五十公尺，实际掘进了一百五十九点七公尺，超过原计划百分之六，超过了原定额百分之八十六点三。另外，还节省了四十七个炮，十四个雷管。
    六月十九号，可以说是我们最高兴的一天。这一天，我们全组三个班同时创造了新纪录，我们班（三人）前进五公尺零五、邱德一班（四人）前进七公尺，三班共进十八公尺三十三公分。为了庆祝我们的这个胜利，工会还专派电影队给我们演了个电影。
    我们很清楚，没有朝鲜前线的胜利，也就没有我们的幸福和安全，当然更谈不上什么生产和建设。因此我们全组除积极地参加爱国增产竞赛以外，并热烈地响应了抗美援朝总会关于捐献飞机大炮的号召：全组共捐三百一十万元，其中我们俩就各献了六十万元。
    从上面看来，我们在生产上是取得了一些成绩。但这些成绩的取得，首先应该归功于你和党的英明领导，归功于你和党对我们的培养教育。我们感觉到自己各方面都很不够。可是，我们一想到了你，就又立即增加了决心和勇气。我们敢向你保证：我们要永远地戒骄戒躁，继续开动脑筋，学习技术，团结全体职工和技术人员，为超额完成一九五一年的生产任务，为早日打败美国侵略者而斗争。祝你永远健康！
