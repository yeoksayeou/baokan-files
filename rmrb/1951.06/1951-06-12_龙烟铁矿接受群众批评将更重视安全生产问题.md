　　Longyan Iron Mine Accepts Public Criticism and Will Pay More Attention to Safety in Production

Editor:

　　The criticism of our mine by reader Lan Lan, published in the People's Daily on May 11th in the Readers' Letters column, is basically correct. Our mine did indeed have four consecutive accidents on April 17th, 18th, and 19th, resulting in minor injuries to three workers, temporary fainting spells for four workers, and one worker seriously injured and killed. The details of the accidents will not be discussed here. The objective reason for the accidents is that our mine has recently added new workers, most of whom lack mining experience. Although important tasks such as drilling and blasting are carried out under the guidance of experienced veteran miners, sometimes attention is insufficient, and the foremen are negligent in supervision and inspection, which can easily lead to accidents. In addition, the mine's ventilation equipment has temporarily failed to keep up with the need, and the quality of blasting caps and fuses is sometimes poor, and these material conditions also have a certain impact. However, the most important thing that we should seriously examine and correct is that many of our cadres do not pay enough attention to safety issues and have failed to elevate safety issues to the important position they deserve. Some of our leading cadres also tend to have a "make-do" mentality on safety issues due to the urgency of production tasks and poor material conditions, which we should strictly examine. At present, although we cannot immediately completely solve all safety aspects (including labor protection) problems, we must take the initiative to gradually overcome difficulties. We are about to promote some workers with technical experience to serve as safety officers, to conduct in-depth safety education for workers; to improve the tunnels with poor safety equipment as soon as possible, such as installing ventilation pipes, opening air ducts, and installing safety gears in some inclined shafts. Before the safety equipment of some tunnels is improved, we must explain all safety precautions to the workers, and temporarily suspend work when necessary.

　　Comrade Lan Lan's criticism has raised our understanding of safety production by one step, and we are very grateful.

### 龙烟铁矿接受群众批评将更重视安全生产问题

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　龙烟铁矿接受群众批评将更重视安全生产问题编辑同志：
    人民日报五月十一日读者来信栏所刊登的读者蓝兰同志对我矿的批评基本上是正确的。我矿确曾在四月十七、十八、十九三天连续发生四次事故，使三名工人受轻伤，四名工人一时晕倒，一名工人重伤致死。事故发生的经过，在这里不讲了。发生事故的客观原因是由于最近我矿增加了新工人，他们大多缺乏采矿经验。打眼、放炮等重要工作，虽均由有采矿经验的老工友带领他们作，但有时注意不够，领班又疏于督促检查，有时就容易发生事故。另外，矿井通风设备一时赶不上需要，放炮的雷管和道火线有时质量不好，这些物质条件也均有一定的影响。但最主要的也是我们应该认真检讨和改正的，还是由于我们很多干部对安全问题重视不够，未能把安全问题提高到应有的重要地位。我们某些领导干部，也往往因生产任务紧迫，物质条件差，在安全问题上存在着“将就”思想，这是我们应该严格检讨的。目前，我们虽不能立即把所有安全方面（包括劳动保护）的问题全部彻底解决，但我们一定要主动地逐步克服困难。我们即将提拔一部分有技术经验的工人担任安全干事，对工人进行深入的安全教育；对安全设备较差的坑道，尽速改善，如安装通风管，开风道，某些斜井要装置安全档，在某些坑道的安全设备未改善前，要将各种应注意的安全事项向工友讲清楚，必要时则暂时停止工作。
    蓝兰同志对我们的批评，使我们对安全生产的认识提高了一步，我们很感激。
