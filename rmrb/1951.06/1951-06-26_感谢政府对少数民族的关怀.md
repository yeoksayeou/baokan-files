    Thanking the Government for its Care for Ethnic Minorities
    Editor's Note: After the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Provisional Plan for Training Ethnic Minority Cadres" and the "Provisional Plan for Preparing the Central Institute for Nationalities," Wang Wenxi, a student at the Hui Muslim School, Ma Xuefei, Zhao Shijie, and Yu Yanbo, Hui Muslim students at Beijing Agricultural University, and Mu Huaiying, a Hui Muslim member of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote letters to support this wise measure of the government. Here is one of the selected letters.
Editor comrades:
    I am a Hui Muslim. After reading the "Provisional Plan for Training Ethnic Minority Cadres" and the "Provisional Plan for Preparing the Central Institute for Nationalities" promulgated by the Government Administration Council, I was so happy that I couldn't speak. Our ethnic minority people have always been discriminated against by the reactionary ruling class. I remember when I was studying in Tianjin under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I suffered a lot of insults and discrimination, and I even got sick from anger.
    After Tianjin was liberated, I joined the army. I deeply felt the warmth of the revolutionary family. I don't eat pork; during the New Year and festivals, the leaders take special care of me. During Ramadan for our Hui Muslims, the leaders also give us holiday allowances. Comrades also care for us like brothers. The Communist Party and the People's Government care for and take care of ethnic minorities everywhere, and respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, which makes me extremely moved. I firmly support the ethnic policy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their correct leadership. I will always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work hard to train myself, and be a good cadre of the people.
    The People's Government, in accordance with the spirit of the ethnic policy in the Common Program, promulgated the "Provisional Plan for Training Ethnic Minority Cadres" and the "Provisional Plan for Preparing the Central Institute for Nationalities," which I wholeheartedly support, and I congratulate the successful implementation of these two plans. I hope that the comrades of all brotherly ethnic groups who participate in the Nationalities Institute will study hard, improve their political awareness and working ability under the education of the Communist Party, and unite around Chairman Mao like brothers; and in the future, repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their care and consideration for our ethnic minorities with good work.

        Mu Huaiying, Hui Muslim people of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    感谢政府对少数民族的关怀
    编者按：政务院颁布了“培养少数民族干部试行方案”及“筹办中央民族学院试行方案”后，回民学校学生王文禧，北京农业大学回族学生马学飞、赵士杰、余彦波，中国人民解放军某部回胞穆怀英等先后来信拥护政府这一英明的措施。这里刊登的是从其中选出的一封。编辑同志：
    我是一个回民。看了政务院颁布的“培养少数民族干部试行方案”及“筹办中央民族学院试行方案”后，我高兴得说不出话来。我们少数民族人民，过去一直受着反动统治阶级的歧视。记得在国民党反动统治时，我在天津上学，受了很多侮辱和歧视，甚至气得生了病。
    天津解放后，我参加了部队工作。我深深感到革命大家庭的温暖。我不吃猪肉；过年过节，上级都特别照顾我。在我们回族的斋月里，上级还发给我们过节费。同志们也都像亲兄弟一样关心我们。共产党、人民政府处处关心和照顾少数民族，尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，这使我感动万分。我坚决拥护共产党、毛主席的民族政策，感谢共产党、毛主席的正确领导。我要永远跟着共产党、毛主席走，努力锻炼自己，作一个人民的好干部。
    人民政府根据共同纲领中民族政策的精神，颁布了“培养少数民族干部试行方案”和“筹办中央民族学院试行方案”，我全心全意地拥护，并庆祝这两个方案试行成功。我希望参加民族学院学习的各兄弟民族同志们，在共产党的教育下，努力学习，提高自己的政治觉悟和工作能力，像亲兄弟一样团结在毛主席的周围；将来以做好工作来报答共产党、毛主席对我们少数民族的关怀与照顾。
