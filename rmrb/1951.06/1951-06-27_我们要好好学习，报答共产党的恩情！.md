Reader's Letters:

　　We must study hard to repay the Communist Party's kindness!
    To the Editor:
    The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party is here. We, these few Tibetan women, sincerely thank the Communist Party for bringing us happy days.
    In the past reactionary ruling period, most of us Tibetan women were illiterate, knowing only how to work from morning till night, and knowing very little about social affairs. The places where we Tibetan people live are mountainous and the water is deep, and transportation is inconvenient. Coupled with the long-term plunder of us by the Kuomintang reactionaries, our lives were very hard. In the past, Kuomintang bandit troops often drove us out of our tents and lived inside; they dragged Tibetan youth to serve as Ula (forced labor), and dragged our cattle to carry things. They arbitrarily beat, scolded and slaughtered our Tibetan people.
    In February 1950, Xikang was liberated. The People's Liberation Army treated the Tibetan people very well, treating the sick and solving difficulties for those in need. The People's Government also established many schools, allowing us to improve our culture. The People's Government also built roads to facilitate transportation, bringing in a lot of supplies to improve our lives. Many of our Tibetan youth have joined the revolution and left their hometowns to study. The Communist Party and the People's Government take care of us meticulously, even better than our parents. Thinking of the oppression we suffered in the past, and the bright and happy life we have now, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
    The four of us participated in the cadre training class after the liberation of Xikang last year. When the Central People's Government Southwest Visiting Group went to Xikang, we were responsible for reception work, and later we came to Beijing with the visiting group. In February of this year, the government sent us to study at the Mongolian-Tibetan School. Our learning and living environment is very good, which we could not have dreamed of before. We cannot express our joy and happiness. We must study hard, prepare to serve the people well in the future, and repay the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

### 我们要好好学习，报答共产党的恩情！

　　我们要好好学习，报答共产党的恩情！编辑同志：
    中国共产党三十周年纪念日到了。我们这几个藏族妇女，衷心感谢共产党带给我们幸福的日子。
    在过去反动统治时期，我们藏族妇女大多数都是文盲，一天到晚只知道做活，对于社会上的事知道的很少。我们藏族人民所住的地方，山高水深，交通不便，加上国民党反动派长期对我们的掠夺，使我们生活很苦。过去国民党匪军常把我们从篷帐里赶出来，他们在里面住；他们把藏族青年拉去当乌拉（苦工），把我们的牛拉去驮东西。他们随意打骂屠杀我们藏民。
    一九五○年二月，西康解放了。人民解放军对藏族人民很好，有病的给治病，有困难的给解决困难。人民政府又办了许多学校，使我们得以提高自己的文化。人民政府又修公路，便利交通，运来许多物资，改善我们的生活。我们许多藏族青年都参加了革命，离了家乡去学习。共产党和人民政府照顾我们无微不至，比我们的爹娘还好。想到过去所受的压迫，和现在光明幸福的生活，我们衷心感谢毛主席和共产党。
    我们四个人在去年西康解放后，参加了干部训练班。中央人民政府西南访问团去西康的时候，我们担任招待工作，后来就随访问团来北京。今年二月政府把我们送到蒙藏学校读书。我们的学习和生活环境很好，这是以前做梦也想不到的。我们无法说出我们的高兴和快乐。我们一定好好学习，准备将来好好为人民服务，来报答共产党、毛主席的恩情。
