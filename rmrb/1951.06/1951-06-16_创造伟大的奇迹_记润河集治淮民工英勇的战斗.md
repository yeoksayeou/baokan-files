　　Creating a Great Miracle
　　—A Record of the Valiant Struggle of the Runheji Huai River Project Laborers
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Mào Fújūn
　　At the Runheji Sluice Gate construction site in the Huai River's mid-stream flood storage area, 30,000 skilled workers, laborers, and engineering personnel are working around the clock in a concentrated effort. This reporter recently visited Runheji, met with the heroic figures among these workers and laborers, and heard many vivid stories.
　　The young engineering personnel, Gù Chéngshì, is a fourth-year student at Datong University. He came to the Huai River last year to participate in the Huai River project. He and several other engineering personnel were jointly responsible for laying the clay layer for the sluice gate foundation. Using clay laying instead of pile driving is a completely new undertaking in Chinese water conservancy construction. Difficulties arose as soon as this work began. Because the soil of the gate foundation contained too much moisture, when clay was laid and pounded with a tamper, it was like pounding on rubber, and it could not be compacted firmly. Ordinary soil can be compacted well after nine tamps, but this type of soil could not be compacted even after thirty consecutive tamps. They worked continuously for two or three days but were still unable to proceed. To overcome this difficulty, they first tried to dig a drainage ditch next to the gate foundation. Although this method had some effect, it did not completely solve the problem of clay laying. Finally, they came up with a method of first laying a layer of sand on the wet mud, and then laying clay on the sand. Because the sand layer absorbed some of the water, it was easier to compact firmly when tamping. In the process of overcoming difficulties, they worked day and night. Gù Chéngshì worked continuously for three whole nights. When others advised him to rest, he said, "I can't sleep anyway. I won't feel at ease until I see success." In this way, they finally successfully completed the arduous task of laying 1,700 cubic meters of clay.
　　Qí Shùdé, is a drainage worker. At the beginning of the project, he and six other workers operated three water pumps, undertaking the heavy task of drainage. Because there were few people, few machines, and a large task, they often had to work sixteen hours a day, but no one complained. Once, after several days of continuous rain, precisely when the drainage work was very tense, on a dark and rainy night, the drainage ditch was suddenly blocked, and the water could not be discharged. Qí Shùdé, Hú Xìngāng and others immediately jumped into the water to dig the drainage ditch, getting covered in mud. They did not come ashore until the drainage ditch was cleared. Another time, because there were not enough water pumps, Qí Shùdé was ordered to transport three water pumps from Runheji to Shouxian County. On the way back, due to rain, the dock workers were unwilling to move the machines to change ships. Qí Shùdé braved the heavy rain to move the machines while patiently persuading the dock workers, saying, "This is an urgent matter for the Huai River project. A delay will cause problems. How can we face the people?" As a result, he moved more than twenty dock workers who helped him move the machines from the small boat to the large boat, and they were transported to Runheji that day. At this time, although the number of water pumps and drainage workers had increased, there were still not enough water pumps. The reason was that in addition to drainage, seven water pumps were also needed to pump water from the Huai River to wash the yellow sand used for the project. This was an important problem that urgently needed to be solved. In order not to affect the drainage work on the construction site, drainage team engineer Qī Diànlái, squad leader Yè Zhōng, Hú Xìngāng, and workers Yú Jīnlóng, Qí Shùdé and others decided to experiment with modifying the water pumps. After careful experimentation, they finally cleverly installed seven pipes on two larger 25-horsepower water pumps to replace the original seven water pumps, each equipped with only one pipe, which were used to wash the yellow sand. In this way, five more water pumps could be used for drainage on the construction site.
　　The railway workers such as Wáng Chánghuì, who laid the light rail, also overcame many difficulties in their work and did a very good job, just like the drainage workers. When they first arrived at the construction site, there were only six people, and they needed to lay 21 kilometers of light rail within the scheduled time. Under normal circumstances, such a project would require at least fifty skilled workers to complete. What should be done? Wáng Chánghuì immediately thought of a way to select thirty young people from the laborers to be apprentices. They not only worked day and night themselves, but also actively taught the apprentices technical skills in their work. As a result, thirty laborers quickly learned how to tighten screws, lay rails, drive spikes, and maintain the road, becoming their powerful assistants. Now they have established a railway squad of more than forty people at the construction site, becoming a vital force in laying light rail. Wherever the construction site needs materials, their light rail is laid there.
　　Xiè Hóngyǒu, who came from a hired peasant background, is an outstanding laborer on the Huai River project. He has been selected as a model for the Huai River project four times. At the Runheji construction site, he participated in the very arduous task of excavating the diversion channel upstream and downstream of the fixed river channel. When digging the diversion channel, Xiè Hóngyǒu always took the lead in standing in the silt to dig. The mud on his legs dried and cracked into many bloody openings, but he still gritted his teeth and continued. When the river was dug to a depth of two meters, spring water gushed out from the ground, and the laborers were very anxious. At this time, it was raining again, and Xiè Hóngyǒu was sick, but in order to urgently block the spring, he got out of bed, shouldered his shovel and left. No one could stop him. Many laborers were moved and followed him to work on the emergency project. When others advised him not to work while sick, he said, "The People's Volunteers are shedding blood on the front lines, enduring all kinds of hardships. What is it to us to suffer this little bit! I must keep going!"
　　Due to the heroic struggles of these heroic people, the arduous and complex Runheji Sluice Gate project, which would have taken at least three years to complete in the past, will now be completed in three months, and it certainly can be completed.

　　创造伟大的奇迹       
    ——记润河集治淮民工英勇的战斗
    新华社记者　冒茀君
    在淮河中游蓄洪区的润河集分水闸工地上，三万个技术工人、民工和工程人员正在不分昼夜地突击工作。记者最近访问润河集，会见了这些工人和民工中间的英雄人物，并听到很多生动的故事。
    年青的工程人员顾澄世，是大同大学四年级的学生，去年来淮河参加治淮工作。他和其他几个工程人员一同担负铺闸基粘土层的任务。用铺粘土代替打桩，这在中国水利建设上还是一个全新的工作。这工作刚一开始就发生困难，闸基的泥土因含水分过多，铺上粘土打硪时，就像硪打在橡皮上一样，始终打不结实。如普通土打九遍硪就很好，但这种土连续打上三十遍还是不行。他们连续工作了两三天，仍无法进行下去。为了克服这个困难，他们首先想办法在闸基旁边挖一条龙沟排水，这个办法虽然收到一些效果，但是仍然没有彻底解决铺粘土的问题。最后，他们才想出办法先在稀泥上铺一层砂，再在砂上铺粘土，由于砂层吸收了一部分水，因而打硪时就容易打得结实了。在克服困难的过程中，他们日以继夜地工作。顾澄世一连突击了三个整夜。别的人劝他休息，他说：“我无论如何睡不着，一定要看到成功才放心。”就这样，他们终于胜利地完成铺设一千七百公方粘土的艰苦任务。
    齐树德，是个排水工人。工程开始时，他同其他六个工人开动三部抽水机，担负着繁重的排水任务。因为人少，机器少，任务又大，他们经常每天要工作十六小时，但谁也没有叫一声苦。有一次，因为连续下了好几天雨，正是排水工作非常紧张的时候，在一个黑漆的雨夜，龙沟忽然被淤塞了，水排不出去，齐树德、胡信纲等就首先跳下水去挖龙沟，弄得满身都是稀泥，一直到龙沟通了，他们才上岸。又一次，因为抽水机不够用，齐树德奉命从润河集到寿县去调运三部抽水机。在回来的路上，因遇天雨，码头工人不愿搬机器换船。齐树德就一面冒着大雨搬运机器，一面耐心地动员码头工人说：“这是治淮的紧急大事，一迟就误事了，怎对得起人民呢？”结果感动二十多个码头工人帮他一道搬运，终将机器从小船搬上大船，当天就运到了润河集。这时，虽然抽水机和抽水工人都增加了，但是抽水机仍然不够用。原因是这时除了排水之外，还需要用七部抽水机在淮河边上抽水冲洗工程上用的黄砂。这是一个重要的而又急待解决的问题。为了不要影响工地上的排水工作，排水中队工程师戚殿莱，中队长叶忠、胡信纲，和工人于金龙、齐树德等决定将抽水机试验改装。经过细心试验的结果，他们终于巧妙地将二部二十五匹马力的较大的抽水机装上七条管子，用来代替原来每部只装有一条管子的七部冲洗黄砂的抽水机。这样，就又可以多出五部抽水机用到工地上去排水了。
    铺设轻便铁道的王长惠等铁路工人，也和排水工人一样，在工作中克服了重重困难，把工作作得很好。他们开始到工地时只有六个人，需要在预定的时间内铺设轻便铁道二十一公里。如在平时，这样的工程至少需要五十个熟练工人才能完成。怎么办呢？王长惠立即想办法从民工中选择三十个青年来作徒弟。他们不仅自己日以继夜地工作，同时在工作中积极教会徒弟学技术，三十个民工因而很快地就学会了上螺丝，铺铁轨，打道钉和养路等工作，成为他们有力的助手。现在他们已在工地上成立了一支四十多人的铁路中队，成为铺设轻便铁道的生力军。工地上那里需要器材，他们的轻便铁道就铺设到那里。
    雇农出身的谢洪友是治淮线上优秀的民工，他曾经四次被评选为治淮模范。在润河集工地上，他参加了非常艰苦的开挖固定河槽上下游的引河工程。在挖引河时，谢洪友总是带头站在淤泥里挖，腿上的泥干了，裂成许多血口子，他依然咬紧牙关干下去。挖河挖到两公尺深时，地下就涌出泉水，民工们都非常着急。这时天又下雨，谢洪友正在生病，但为了紧急堵塞泉眼，他从床上爬起来，扛着铁锹就走，谁也劝阻不住，很多民工被感动得都跟着他去突击工作。别人劝他不要带病工作时，他说：“人民志愿军在前方流血，吃尽千辛万苦，我们吃这点苦算什么呢！我一定要干下去！”
    艰巨复杂的润河集分水闸工程，由于这些英雄的人的英勇奋战，以往至少要三年才能完成，现在要在三个月内完成，而且一定可以完成。
