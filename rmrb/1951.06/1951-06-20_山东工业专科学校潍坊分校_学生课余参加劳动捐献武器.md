　　Students Participate in Labor in Their Spare Time to Donate Weapons
Editor:

    After the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the call to donate airplanes and cannons, the students of our Shandong Provincial Industrial College Weifang Branch enthusiastically expressed their willingness to contribute their strength to support the Volunteer Army. The Student Union and the Communist Youth League General Branch Committee immediately called on students, under the principle of not hindering their studies, to find ways to engage in spare-time production and actively donate airplanes and cannons.

    Now is the wheat harvest season, and the students came up with the idea of donating by helping farmers pull wheat in their spare time. The Student Union immediately made unified arrangements and took on work in the city. On June 9th, the "Resist America and Aid Korea Labor Donation Team" of each class happily went to the countryside.

    In the wheat fields, the students worked hard barefoot and bare-backed. Everyone put forward the slogans "Pull it clean, tie it tight" and "Pull one more handful of wheat, increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea by one point," and launched a wheat-pulling competition with each other. Some students got blisters on their hands, but when they thought of the Volunteer Army fighting hard on the front lines to defend our happy lives, they forgot the pain and fatigue, and their enthusiasm immediately returned. More than twenty students pulled an acre of wheat clean in half an hour.

    While pulling wheat, the students also carried out propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea to the farmers. The farmers were all moved and said, "You are working so hard for resisting America and aiding Korea. We farmers should contribute our strength and donate more airplanes and cannons."

    In the four days from the 9th to the 12th, we have pulled more than 70 mu of wheat and received more than 7 million yuan in wages. We will strive to pull more wheat and contribute more to donating weapons and resisting America and aiding Korea.

    增加生产捐献飞机大炮  支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
　　山东工业专科学校潍坊分校        
    学生课余参加劳动捐献武器编辑同志：
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮的号召后，我们山东省立工业专科学校潍坊分校的同学们，都热情地表示愿意贡献自己的力量来支援志愿军。学生会和青年团总支委员会立刻号召同学们，在不妨碍学习的原则下，想办法进行课余生产，踊跃捐献飞机大炮。
    现在正是麦收期间，同学们就想出了课余替农民拔麦子进行捐献的办法。学生会当即统一布置，在市上揽下了活。六月九日，各班同学的“抗美援朝劳动捐献队”就愉快地下乡去了。
    同学们在麦田里，赤脚光背，努力地工作着。大家提出了“拔得干净、捆得结实”和“多拔一把麦，就增加一分抗美援朝力量”的口号，互相展开拔麦竞赛。有的同学手上起了泡，但他们一想到志愿军为了保卫我们的幸福生活而在前线艰苦地作战时，就忘记了疼和累，劲头立刻来了。一亩麦子，二十多个同学在半点钟内就拔得干干净净。
    同学们在拔麦时，又向农民们进行了抗美援朝的宣传工作。农民们都感动地说：“你们为了抗美援朝，这样下劲干。咱们农民更要拿出自己的力量，多多捐献飞机大炮。”
    九日到十二日四天中，我们已拔了七十余市亩的麦子，得到工资七十余万元。我们还要争取拔更多的麦子，为捐献武器抗美援朝贡献更多的力量。
