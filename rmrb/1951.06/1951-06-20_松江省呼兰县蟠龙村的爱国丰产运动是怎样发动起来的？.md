　　Before the cadres and farmers of Panlong Village, Fifth District, Hulan County, Songjiang Province, launched the patriotic production increase movement, they did not clearly understand the significance of this movement. Wang Zhenlin, the village finance and grain committee member, said: "It's enough to produce enough for one year's consumption. Increased grain production will inevitably raise the land grade." Some farmers believed that whether or not there was competition, things would be the same. Who in the village doesn't know who? Farmer Wu Qingrong said: "Last year, we were called upon to increase production by five dou of grain, and this year we are still called upon to increase production by five dou of grain. The land hasn't changed. How can we increase production?" After the district work team arrived in the village and understood the people's thinking, they first convened a meeting of all party members and cadres to explain the significance of the patriotic production increase movement, explain the burden policy, and persuade party members and cadres to take the lead. After the party members and cadres initially cleared their minds, they all expressed their attitudes at the meeting, guaranteeing that they would launch the patriotic production increase movement in their village. In order to set an example and promote overall progress, the work team also helped the Li Rong mutual aid team, which had increased grain production last year due to its emphasis on farming techniques, to formulate a production increase plan. After Li Rong's team's production increase plan was fully developed, they immediately convened a meeting of all village party members, cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and elderly farmers, and invited the village head, the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary, and the three more active mutual aid team leaders from the neighboring Majia Village to participate. At the meeting, Li Rong's team displayed the seeds, refined fertilizer, and farm tools they had prepared to complete the production increase plan, allowing everyone to visit. During the meeting, the work team, in conjunction with current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea, guided everyone to discuss and explain that striving to produce and produce more grain to support the volunteer army in resisting America and aiding Korea was a concrete action of patriotism. Farmer Li Guolu denounced the various crimes of Japanese and American imperialism in the discussion, further arousing everyone's enthusiasm for doing a good job in production and supporting the front lines. Then, Li Rong reported on the team's production increase plan and the methods to ensure increased production, and also introduced his experience of improving technology and increasing grain production last year, and explained that his land grade had not been raised despite producing more grain last year. Everyone was convinced by his report and decided to follow his methods. When Li Rong's team challenged everyone, two mutual aid teams immediately stepped forward to accept the challenge. The three mutual aid team leaders from Majia Village also accepted the challenge. After the meeting, all mutual aid teams in the village launched challenge competitions. Li Rong's team and Yu Qingzhi's women's team also challenged provincial labor models Wang Youshan and Huang Guizhen successively. In this way, a wave of patriotic production increase movement was set off in the whole village. During the movement, 56 percent of the village's cultivated land was covered with manure, and the planting area of commercial grain reached 46.1 percent of the total cultivated land area. The excellent variety of "Man Cang Jin" soybean seeds have been completely selected by grain, and the purity has reached more than 94 percent. More than one hundred hectares of wheat have been fertilized with refined fertilizer. Thirty-nine women with labor power in the village have participated in agricultural production.

　　松江省呼兰县蟠龙村的爱国丰产运动是怎样发动起来的？
　　汪冠群
    松江省呼兰县五区蟠龙村的干部和农民在未发动爱国丰产运动以前，对这一运动的意义是认识不清的。村财粮委员王振林说：“一年生产够一年吃用就行啦，多打粮免不了提高地级。”有些农民认为竞赛不竞赛总是那么回事，本村里谁还不知道谁？农民伍庆荣说：“去年也号召多打五斗粮，今年还号召多打五斗粮，地也没变样，怎么就能多打粮啊？”区工作组到村，了解了群众的思想情况，首先召开了全体党员、干部会议，讲解了爱国丰产运动的意义，解释了负担政策，并说服党员和干部，要起带头作用。党员、干部的思想初步打通以后，都在会上表明了态度，保证要把本村的爱国丰产运动搞起来。为了树立榜样推动全面，工作组又帮助去年因讲究耕作技术多打了粮食的李荣互助组，订定增产计划。在李荣组的增产计划酝酿成熟后，即召集全村党员、干部、互助组组长，老年农民开会，并邀请邻近的马家村村长、中共党支部书记和三个较积极的互助组组长来参加。会场上陈列了李荣组为完成增产计划准备的种籽、细肥、农具，让大家参观。在会议中，工作组结合抗美援朝的时事教育，引导大家讨论，说明努力生产，多打粮食，支援志愿军抗美援朝，就是爱国的具体行动。农民李国禄在讨论中控诉了日、美帝国主义的种种罪行，更激发起大家搞好生产，支援前线的热情。接着，李荣报告该组的增产计划和保证增产的办法，又介绍了他去年提高技术、多打粮食的经验，并说明他去年多打了粮食，地级并没有提高。大家被他的报告说服了，决心照着他的办法做。当李荣组向大家挑战时，当场就有两个互助组起而应战。马家村的三个互助组长也应战了。会后，全村各互助组都展开了挑战竞赛。李荣组和于青芝妇女组，并先后向省劳动模范王有山、黄桂贞应战。全村就这样掀起了爱国丰产运动的热潮。运动中，全村耕地面积的百分之五十六都上了满粪，商品粮的种植面积达到总耕地面积的百分之四十六点一。优良品种“满仓金”大豆种籽已全部粒选，纯度达到百分之九十四以上。一百多垧小麦都上了细肥。村中三十九名有劳动力的妇女都参加了农业生产。
