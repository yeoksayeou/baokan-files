The Brave and Lovable Korean People
Member of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, Pu Xixiu

I cherish the memory of the brave and lovable Korean people. The heroic spirit of the Korean people and their profound friendship towards us, which I experienced during my time in Korea, are forever etched in my mind.

As soon as we crossed the Yalu River, we got lost in the ruins of Sinuiju. Enemy planes were buzzing in the night sky, searching for targets. As we groped our way forward, a jeep suddenly came towards us, and the people in the car asked quietly in broken Chinese, "Are you the Chinese People's Delegation?" This jeep led us forward. But because there were too many vehicles, one of ours went tens of miles and still couldn't find the way. In the distance, we saw that jeep waiting for us again at the crossroads. It finally led us to the designated campsite.

In the pitch-black night, the Korean People's Army vigilantly and calmly settled our dozens of vehicles and hundreds of people in the small villages along the way. Although I couldn't see their faces in the dark, I felt their burning friendship.

My eleven days in Pyongyang deepened my experience of the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

We lived in a village. Two companies of the People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery guarded the surrounding mountains. Although enemy planes circled overhead every day, they dared not fly low, and therefore could not find their target.

Xu Zhenghao, Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Republic, personally presided over the reception. She mobilized An Hyoxang (Secretary to Chairman Kim Tu-bong), a first-class translator of the Republic, and all the best translators from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda to serve as our interpreters. All the female staff who entertained us were labor party members. There were female students from Kim Il-sung University, female bank employees, and responsible cadres from the Democratic Women's League. They brought us tea and meals, poured water, and washed our clothes. Although we could not communicate with each other verbally, we could communicate by writing. They felt that being able to personally receive the representatives of the Chinese people was the most honorable thing. Sometimes we took off our clothes and wanted to wash them ourselves secretly, but as soon as they found out, they would definitely snatch them away.

General Kim Il-sung's love for the Chinese people was even more impressive. We met this great leader of the Korean people late at night. At the entrance of a mountain village, he had been waiting for us for a long time with Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Heo Ga-i, Chairman of the Democratic Women's League, Park Jeong-ae, Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, Nam Il, and Minister of Culture and Propaganda Xu Zhenghao. At the banquet, according to Chinese custom, he did not ask us to take off our shoes before entering the house. He spoke to us in fluent Chinese. His face, full of confidence in victory, was unforgettable. He repeatedly raised his glass to toast the arrival of the Chinese People's Delegation, to the unity of China and Korea, to the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and to the victory of world peace. "It is not easy to meet, let's talk again!" He treated the guests with such warmth and kindness. Finally, he asked An Hyoxang to translate and sing a Chinese song to congratulate us. "After the war is won, I must come to China to see you." We finally said goodbye.

We went to the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and various units of the People's Army to express our condolences. They greeted us with great ceremony in the midst of difficult combat conditions. The officers and soldiers were all spirited, their dark red faces flashing with the brilliance of victory. This was an indomitable and tenacious army.

In the auditorium of the People's Army Headquarters, when our delegation presented a beautiful purple-red velvet banner embroidered with golden characters to the stage, they all cheered enthusiastically.

Our Chinese Acrobatic Troupe performed the most wonderful programs at the meeting. Korean friends said: "When we saw your performance, we felt that we had increased our infinite strength to fight against American imperialism." Why was this? American imperialism is trying to destroy all the culture and art of Korea, and American imperialism does not allow peaceful people to have culture and art. Later, after I saw the damage done by the American aggressors to Korean cultural relics, I deeply understood the meaning of what they said at that time.

Later, we encountered the same situation in the People's Army unit that had won forty-six Republic Hero titles. This was one of the best-fighting units in Korea, and had been awarded the most glorious titles of Guards Division, Seoul Division, and Kim Chaek Division. In the first stage of the anti-American war, they fought to the Nakdong River. Later, when the US military landed in Incheon, they continued to wage guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. They also captured 5,000 US troops behind enemy lines. In December of last year, they finally joined forces with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Yeoncheon.

The commander of this army treated us in the home of an ordinary family. He mobilized the capable cooks in the army to make dumplings for us to eat. While eating, he talked to us vividly about the scene of joining forces with the Volunteer Army. "One day, our outpost received a report that an unidentified unit had been discovered in the northeast direction. I sent a regiment to scout. The excitement that the reconnaissance brought us was indescribable. We met the Chinese Volunteer Army! We all opened our mouths and stared, unable to speak! We could only rush up and hug the Volunteer Army brothers tightly, everyone jumping and dancing! ... The weather was very cold at that time, and the first thing the Volunteer Army did was to take off their coats and put them on us. How could we wear this coat that everyone needed? We pushed it back and forth to each other for a long time, and I can't say who finally put it on..."

During our stay in Pyongyang, we also met with people from all walks of life in Korea.

Once late at night, we went to the Goksan Chemical Factory in Pyongyang to express our condolences. Nearly a thousand workers' representatives from various factories in East Pyongyang gathered to welcome us. They waited from 5:00 in the evening until 10:00 in the evening and still refused to leave. They finally met their dearest Chinese friends in their hearts. Piles of flowers were presented. When the evil enemy planes came to raid at night, they closed the doors and windows tightly and continued to hold meetings indoors as usual. When we told them how the Chinese working class was launching patriotic labor competitions to resist US aggression and aid Korea, they were moved to tears. They also told us their heroic stories of overcoming difficulties and resuming production under enemy bombing. They brought out the newly produced corn wine and glucose to entertain us, and also gave us newly woven white silk. A female work group leader insisted on taking off her watch and giving it to the Chinese representatives, and we immediately took off our watches and exchanged them. Some took off their gold rings, wrapped them in paper, and wrote on them: "To the great Chinese people."

In the countryside, we visited the spring plowing of Korean farmers during the day, and they insisted on keeping us to stay overnight. They slaughtered their most precious hen to entertain us, and everyone surrounded us and refused to leave. Few of the men and women in the village had not suffered the killings and devastation of the American aggressors. They said: "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to avenge us. We must work hard to repay you."

What moved me most was the scene at a China-Korea Women's Forum held in Pyongyang. Li Jinshun, Vice Chairman of the Democratic Women's League, could not help but shed tears when she accused the atrocities of American imperialism, and everyone present shed tears. Vice Chairman Li Jinshun said: "Being able to accuse the atrocities of the American aggressors in front of our dear Chinese sisters today makes me feel happy as if the pain in my heart has been relieved. Your coming has increased our strength so much."

I cherish the memory of the brave and lovable Korean people. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people that has grown in battle is eternal.

　　英勇可爱的朝鲜人民
    中国人民赴朝慰问团团员　浦熙修
    我怀念着英勇可爱的朝鲜人民。我在朝鲜期间所接触到的朝鲜人民的英勇面貌以及他们对我们那种深厚的友情，永远回绕在我的脑际。
    我们一过鸭绿江，便在新义州的废墟中迷失了道路。敌机在夜空中嗡嗡地寻觅着目标。我们正在摸索前进中，一辆小吉普忽然迎面而来，车上的人用不纯熟的中国话悄悄地问：“是中国人民慰问团吗？”这辆吉普车就领着我们前行。但因车辆太多，我们的一辆走了几十里又找不到道路了。远远地只见那辆小吉普又在叉路口等候着我们。它终于把我们带到了指定的宿营地。
    朝鲜人民军在乌黑的深夜中就这样又机警、又沉着地把我们几十辆车，几百个人一一安顿在沿途的小村落中。在深夜中我虽然看不见他们的面貌，但我感觉到了他们那种火热的友谊。
    在平壤十一天的经历，更使我深深地体验到了中朝人民深厚的友谊。
    我们住在一个村庄中。人民军的两连高射炮部队守护在群山的周围。敌机虽然天天在上空盘旋，但不敢低飞，因之也无从发现目标。
    共和国政府文化宣传相许贞淑亲自主持招待事宜。她动员了共和国的一等翻译安孝相（金枓奉委员长的秘书）及外务省、文化宣传省所有最好的翻译为我们担任翻译。所有招待我们的女工作人员都是劳动党员。有金日成大学的女学生，有银行的女职员，有民主妇女同盟的负责干部。她们为我们送茶送饭，倒水洗衣服。我们彼此虽然言语不通，但我们能够作笔谈。她们认为能够亲自接待中国人民的代表是最光荣的事。有时我们脱下了衣服，想自己偷偷来洗，但只要被她们一发现，一定要被她们抢了去。
    金日成将军对中国人民的友爱更予人以深刻的印象。我们是在深夜会见这位朝鲜人民的伟大领袖的。在一个山村口上他带着副首相兼外务相朴宪永，劳动党中央委员会副委员长许嘉谊，民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱，人民军总参谋长南日及文化宣传相许贞淑等已经等候我们很久了。在宴会时他按照着中国习惯，不要我们脱鞋便进了屋子。他用熟练的中国话和我们谈话。他那充满着胜利信心的面庞使人永远忘不了。他几次地举杯为中国人民的代表慰问团的到来，为中朝两国的团结，为中朝人民军队的胜利，为世界和平的胜利而干杯。“相见不易，再谈一回吧！”他是这样热诚亲切地礼待着客人。他最后要安孝相翻译唱一个中国的歌为我们祝贺。“等战争胜利后，我一定要到中国来看你们。”我们终于告别了。
    我们曾到朝鲜人民军总部和人民军的各种部队里去慰问。他们在艰苦作战的环境中来迎接我们，依然是礼仪隆重。军官们和士兵们个个精神奋发，黑红的脸庞上闪灼着胜利的光辉。这是一支不可屈服的顽强的军队。
    在人民军总部的大礼堂里，当我们慰问团将一面美丽的绣着金字的紫红丝绒锦旗献到台上的时候，他们全体热烈地欢呼着。
    我们的中华杂技团在会上表演了最精彩的节目。朝鲜朋友们说：“我们看见了你们的表演，我们不觉增加了对美国帝国主义作斗争的无限力量。”这是为什么呢？美帝国主义企图毁灭朝鲜的一切文化艺术，美帝国主义是不容许和平的人民有文化艺术的。我后来看见了美国侵略者损毁朝鲜古文物的情形后，才深深体会了他们当时那句话的意义。
    我们后来在曾得过四十六个共和国英雄称号的人民军部队里也遇到了同样的情形。这是朝鲜打得最好的一个部队，曾荣获最光荣的近卫师团、汉城师团及金策师团等称号。他们在抗美战争的第一阶段中曾打到洛东江，后来美军在仁川登陆，他们继续在敌后展开游击战。他们在敌后也曾俘掳了五千美军。去年十二月间，他们终于和中国人民志愿军在涟川会师。
    这位军长在老百姓的家里款待我们。他动员了军中能干的炊事员为我们包饺子吃。他一边吃着一边眉飞色舞地向我们谈着和志愿军会师的一幕情景。“有一天，我们的前哨接到报告：东北方向发现有一支番号不明的部队。我派了一个联队去侦察。那侦察的结果所带给我们的兴奋，我是难以形容的。我们遇到中国的志愿部队啊！我们大家张着口，瞪着眼，不会说话啊！我们只有一拥而上，紧紧地拥抱住志愿军的兄弟们，大家跳啊！舞啊！……那时天气很冷，志愿军第一个动作就是脱下大衣给我们穿上。我们怎能穿这件大家都需要的大衣呢？彼此推过来，推过去，相持了很久，我说不出来最后是谁穿上了。……”
    我们在平壤期间，还和朝鲜各界人民见了面。
    有一次在深夜里我们到平壤的谷产化学工厂去慰问。东平壤各工厂的工人代表聚集了将近千余人前来欢迎我们。他们从傍晚五时一直等到晚上十点钟还不肯散去。他们终于见到了他们心目中最亲爱的中国友人。鲜花一堆堆地送上来。万恶的敌机来夜袭时，他们把门窗紧闭好，照样在屋内开会。当我们告诉他们中国工人阶级如何展开爱国劳动竞赛来抗美援朝时，他们感动得流下了眼泪。他们也把他们自己在敌机轰炸下克服困难、恢复生产的英勇故事告诉我们。他们将刚生产出来的苞米酒、葡萄糖拿来招待我们，又把新织出的白绢送给我们。一位女工组长一定要脱下手表送给中国的代表，我们也马上脱下自己的手表来交换。有的把金戒指拿下，用纸包上，上面写着：“送给伟大的中国人民。”
    在农村里，我们白天参观了朝鲜农民春耕的情况，晚上就被他们强留着住下。他们宰杀了最珍贵的母鸡来招待我们，每个人围着我们不肯离去。村中的男女，很少是不曾遭受美国侵略者的杀戮与摧残的。她们说：“中国人民志愿军前来给我们报了仇。我们一定要努力工作来报答你们。”
    最使我感动的是在平壤举行的一次中朝妇女座谈会上的情景。民主妇女同盟副委员长李金顺在控诉美国帝国主义者的暴行时不禁热泪盈眶，在座的人也都流下了眼泪。李金顺副委员长说：“我们今天能在亲爱的中国姊妹们面前控诉美国侵略者的暴行，使我心中仿佛减轻了痛苦而感到愉快。你们前来不知使我们增加了多少力量。”
    我怀念着英勇可爱的朝鲜人民。中朝人民在战斗中生长的友谊是永恒不灭的。
