Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 22nd: Protests against the Supreme Court's shameful verdict on the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party are growing louder in the United States.

　　Leaders of fifty unions belonging to the AFL, CIO, and independent unions, with a total membership of 100,000, held a "Labor Action Committee" meeting in New York City on June 17th. The meeting called on all local unions and workers to denounce the Supreme Court's verdict and demand a retrial of the eleven convicted Communist leaders. The meeting emphasized the need to awaken the American people to the danger they face as a result of the Supreme Court's shameful decision.

　　On June 20th, the All-Slavic American Congress convened a peace conference in New York with over a thousand participants. The Executive Secretary of the Congress, Pilinsky, called on Slavic organizations to actively petition Truman, demanding a re-examination of the court's verdict against the Communist leaders. His speech was welcomed by the attendees.

　　The New York headquarters of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council has released a list of prominent individuals who support the movement demanding a retrial and the revocation of the Supreme Court's verdict. These individuals include sociologist and writer Fairchild, University of Chicago professor and educator Harvey Foster, sociologist Lynd, and Compass columnist Berley.

　　The black-owned weekly, *The Boston Chronicle*, pointed out in an editorial that the Supreme Court's verdict, which strikes at the Communists today, will strike at democratic forces without communist views tomorrow. *New World Review* pointed out that the verdict clearly reveals "how hypocritical are the principles upon which the U.S. government's foreign policy is based." The newspaper called on the American people to "immediately rise up and speak out to defend democratic traditions and defend world peace."

　　Many prominent labor leaders, pastors, writers, scientists, artists, and professionals have lodged strong protests against the Supreme Court's verdict. Judge Tawney of Minneapolis delivered a speech, calling on everyone not to retreat any further, but to resist the attack on freedom of speech.

    美国人民要求政府撤消判决
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在美国，抗议最高法院对于美国共产党十一位领袖的可耻的判决的呼声已经越来越响了。
    拥有十万会员的五十个属于劳联、产联和独立的工会的领袖们，六月十七日在纽约市举行了一次“劳工行动委员会”会议，会议号召一切地方工会和工人斥责最高法院的判决，并要求重审被判罪的十一位共产党领袖。会议强调必须唤醒美国人民注意，因最高法院的可耻决定而使他们面临的危险。
    六月二十日，美籍斯拉夫人大会在纽约召集有一千多人参加的和平大会，大会执行秘书皮林斯基号召斯拉夫人团体，积极向杜鲁门请愿，要求重新审查法庭对共产党领袖的判决。他的讲话受到了到会者的欢迎。
    艺术、科学、自由职业全国委员会纽约总部又发表了一批著名人士的名单，他们拥护要求重审并且撤消最高法院的判决的运动，这些人士中有社会学家、作家费尔契尔德，芝加哥大学教授、教育家哈维福斯特，社会学家凌德，《指南针日报》专栏作家柏尔利。
    黑人办的周刊《波士顿纪事报》在社论中指出，最高法院的判决今天打击了共产党人，明天就要打击并没有共产主义见解的民主势力了。《新世界评论报》指出，判决明白地揭露了，“美国政府的外交政策所根据的原则是多么虚妄”。该报号召美国人民“立即起来大声疾呼，保卫民主传统和保卫世界和平。”
    许多著名的劳工领袖、牧师、作家、科学家、艺术家和自由职业者，对于最高法院的判决都提出了坚决的抗议。民主人士陶吞法官在明尼阿波利斯发表演说，号召大家不再退却，应该抵抗对言论自由的进攻。
