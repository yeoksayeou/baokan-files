The "July 1st" of 1951 is a grand festival celebrated by all the Chinese people. It is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, in a free world, we joyfully and excitedly welcome this glorious anniversary, and we would like to express our highest respect and deepest gratitude to our great leader Chairman Mao, to the Communist Party of China, and to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the same time, we would also like to express our sincere congratulations to our people for having been freed forever from the shackles of darkness and for having won a bright and splendid future.

The thirty-year history of the Communist Party of China is a history of arduous struggle, and it is also a history of the Chinese people's revolution gradually moving towards victory. The Chinese people have long had the desire to overthrow the feudal system, and history is full of peasant revolutionary waves. For more than a hundred years, foreign capitalist forces have invaded, and we have had many bloody struggles to protect national independence. However, all previous revolutions and struggles have failed. Internal feudal forces colluded with foreign imperialism, plunging China into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state. With the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao, mastering Marxism-Leninism and closely integrating it with China's revolutionary practice, creating an incomparably brave revolutionary armed force, and creating a united front of all strata, parties, and nationalities of the country, after a long period of arduous struggle, our motherland was liberated from the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. We established the People's Republic of China and a new people's democratic dictatorship regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. "The Common Program" concentrates the will of the people of the whole country and is the most perfect crystallization of Chairman Mao's thought applied to the current domestic economic, political, cultural, and educational construction.

It has been less than two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the rapid progress in all aspects of national construction is unprecedented. First of all, we abolished all the economic privileges of imperialism and confiscated bureaucratic capital for the people's state ownership, which has become the backbone of the socialist national economy. The land reform in the area with a population of 290 million has been completed. In the coming year, land reform will be fully completed nationwide, except for ethnic minority areas. Counter-revolutionary elements are being suppressed, and more than one million armed bandits have been basically wiped out. In the first half of last year, the malignant inflation of the past twelve years was stopped, the national financial economy was unified, revenue and expenditure were balanced, and prices were stabilized. Transportation has been restored, agricultural and industrial production is approaching pre-war levels, and trade has exceeded pre-war levels, showing a prosperity that has not been seen for many years. In terms of culture and education, since the founding of the country, a nationwide upsurge of ideological study has been set off, and in the recent six months, the cultural aggression forces of US imperialism for the past 100 years have been basically eliminated. These unprecedented construction achievements are obvious to all. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, it would be impossible to achieve such achievements.

We have also achieved equally great achievements in diplomacy. Article 11 of the General Program of the "Common Program" stipulates very clearly: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, first of all, unites with the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly opposes imperialist aggression in order to guarantee the lasting peace of the world." For more than a year, the Central People's Government has done so. What is particularly encouraging to us is that Chairman Mao personally went to Moscow at the end of 1949, shook hands with Marshal Stalin, and concluded the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance," which fixed the brotherly friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. This laid an important foundation for safeguarding the cause of lasting peace in the world.

Since the launch of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, our program of uniting with all people's democratic countries and all oppressed nations to jointly oppose imperialist aggression has been more brilliantly supported and implemented by the people of the whole country. Our Chinese People's Volunteers flocked to Korea and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army. In the past eight months, they have dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive group and driven the American aggressors from the Sino-Korean border back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel.

The achievements of the Chinese people are so rich and outstanding that the imperialists are shocked and dumbfounded. But the imperialists will certainly not be reconciled, especially the US imperialists. It was driven out of mainland China, and it was not reconciled. It occupied our Taiwan and stubbornly supported the dying Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It was defeated in Korea, and it was not reconciled. It further colluded with the remnants of Japanese militarists and wanted to rearm Japan. US imperialists often shamelessly carry out deceptive propaganda, distorting the facts, spreading rumors and slanders, and vainly attempting to achieve the practical effect of instigating dissension. They vainly attempt to alienate our domestic unity and provoke the friendship between our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, but that is futile. We have learned enough about the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks. Today, our domestic unity and international friendship are the two mainstays of our nation-building. The enemy's vain attempt to shake our mainstays is also a vain attempt to destroy our country. But that is futile. We should listen to the imperialists' voices from the opposite side. They vainly attempt to provoke dissension, and we will respond with a hundred times of unity.

Today, the US imperialists' deceptive tricks have in fact been exposed by themselves. The likes of Chiang Kai-shek are national scum spurned by the Chinese people, a collection of Shi Jingtang, Zhang Bangchang, Yuan Shikai, and Wang Jingwei, but the US imperialists regard them as treasures. The Japanese militarists have eight years of bloody feud with us. The blood stains have not yet dried, and the blood debts have not yet been settled, but the US imperialists have formed a partnership with them again. The US imperialists have done everything possible in Korea with unprecedented cruelty and barbarity, but they are still hypocritically decorating themselves and slandering us Chinese people as "aggressors" in Korea. This is the perverse behavior of the US imperialists. They still vainly attempt to carry out provocation and alienation among the Chinese people. Can this only prove their own stupidity?

Today, as we welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we would like to take this opportunity to declare to the people of China and the world: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, our Chinese people are as united as one person. After nearly two years since the founding of the country, everyone has had the opportunity to study and see their own achievements. The people of China, regardless of party affiliation, class, or ethnicity, express their sincere support for our great motherland, the People's Republic of China, for our great leader Chairman Mao, and for our leading party - the Communist Party of China, the vanguard of the working class, without reservation. This sincere and seamless relationship can never be alienated by any imperialist conspiracy or trick.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we must wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao, support the Communist Party of China, support the "Common Program," expand and consolidate our democratic united front, strengthen and defend our people's democratic dictatorship; under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, rapidly complete the construction of new democracy, transform agricultural China into industrial China, so as to transition to a higher stage of socialist construction at an appropriate time.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we must thoroughly oppose US imperialism; we must further deepen our patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea, encourage the people of China to step up support for the just war of the Korean people to resist US aggression, and ensure that this war comes to a victorious end; we must do our best to oppose US imperialism's rearmament of Japan; we must liberate Taiwan and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, a wandering ghost at the bottom of the cauldron.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we must strengthen our movement to defend world peace, strengthen our ties with the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, constantly expand the broad foundation of our peace movement, constantly expose the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers, attack aggressive policies, shatter deceptive propaganda, and make sure that the Third World War attempted by the imperialists can never be realized.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we must intensify our study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learn the spirit of the Communists who serve the people wholeheartedly, learn to master the sharp weapon of criticism and self-criticism, take all the fine styles of the Communist Party as our model, and always under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, work hard, fulfill the historical mission of our various organizations and individuals, and achieve our common highest ideal goal.

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年
    各民主党派发表联合宣言
    【本报讯】各民主党派发表联合宣言，庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年。宣言全文如下：
    一九五一年的“七一”是全中国人民共同庆贺的一个大节日。中国共产党建党以来三十周年了。今天我们在自由的天地中，欢欣鼓舞地迎接着这个光荣的纪念日，谨向我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向中国共产党，向人民解放军和人民志愿军的全体指挥员战斗员，表示最崇高的敬礼和最深厚的感谢；同时也为我们人民自己永远解脱了黑暗的羁绊、赢得了光辉灿烂的幸福前途而表示衷诚的庆贺。
    中国共产党的三十年历史是一部艰苦斗争的历史，也是我们中国人民革命逐步走向胜利的历史。中国人民早就有着推翻封建制度的愿望，历史上充满着农民革命的波澜。一百多年来，外来的资本主义势力侵入，我们为了保障民族的独立，又有了不少次的流血斗争。然而历次的革命和斗争都失败了。内在的封建势力与外来的帝国主义相互勾结，使中国陷入了半封建半殖民地的地位。有了中国共产党，有了毛主席，掌握着马克思列宁主义，和中国的革命实际密切结合，创造了英勇无比的革命武装力量，创造了全国各阶层、各党派、各民族的统一战线，经过长期的艰苦战斗，我们的祖国从半封建半殖民地的枷锁之下解放出来了。我们建立了中华人民共和国，建立了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的新政权。一部“共同纲领”，集中了全国人民的意志，这是毛主席的思想应用在目前国内经济、政治、文教各项建设上的最完美的结晶。
    中华人民共和国建国以来还不到两年，在国家建设上，各方面的突飞猛进的成就是史无前例的。首先我们废除了帝国主义的一切经济特权，没收了官僚资本为人民的国家所有，成为社会主义性质的国家经济的骨干。二亿九千万人口地区的土地改革已经完成了，在今明年内，除了少数民族地区外，要在全国范围内全面完成土地改革。反革命分子遭受着镇压，一百多万的武装土匪已经基本上肃清了。去年上半年已经制止了十二年来的恶性通货膨胀，使国家财政经济得到统一，收支得到平衡，物价得到稳定。交通恢复了，农工业的生产接近了战前的水平，贸易更超过了战前的水平，而呈现出多年来所未有的繁荣。在文教方面，自建国开始，便一直卷起了全国范围内的思想学习的高潮，最近半年更在基本上肃清了美帝国主义一百年来的文化侵略势力。这些史无前例的建设成就是有目共睹的，没有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，要想得到这样的成就，是不可能的事。
    在外交方面我们也有同样伟大的成就。“共同纲领”总纲第十一条规定得很清楚：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”一年多来，中央人民政府照着这样做了。特别使我们鼓舞的，是毛主席在一九四九年末亲自到莫斯科去，和斯大林大元帅握手，缔结了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，把中苏两大民族的兄弟友谊固定了。这便奠定了保卫世界持久和平事业的一个重要的础石。
    抗美援朝的运动发动以来，我们的联合各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，共同反对帝国主义侵略的纲领，更辉煌地为全国人民所拥护而见诸实施。我们的中国人民志愿军蜂涌到朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，八个月来，给予了侵略集团以沉重的打击，把美国侵略者从中朝边境赶回到了三十八度线附近。
    中国人民的成就是这样丰富而卓越，使帝国主义者被震惊得目瞪口呆了。但帝国主义者当然不会甘心，尤其是美帝国主义者。它在中国大陆被驱逐了，不甘心，竟把我们的台湾占据起来，死死地支持着苟延残喘的蒋匪介石。它在朝鲜被打败了，不甘心，又更进一步地和日本军国主义者的残余勾结起来，想重新武装日本。美帝国主义者经常厚颜无耻地进行着欺骗宣传，颠倒黑白，造谣诬蔑，妄想收到挑拨离间的实效。妄想离间我们国内的团结，挑拨我们中苏两国的友谊，但那是徒劳的。帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，我们已经领教够了。今天我们的国内团结和国际友谊，正是我们建国的两大骨干，敌人妄想动摇我们的骨干，也就是妄想破坏我们的国家。但那是徒劳的。帝国主义者的声音，我们正好从反面去听。他们妄想挑拨离间，我们就要以百倍的团结来回答。
    美帝国主义者的欺骗伎俩今天事实上已经由它自己揭露无遗了。蒋匪介石之流是全中国人民所唾弃的民族败类，集石敬瑭、张邦昌、袁世凯、汪精卫之大成，而美帝国主义者却把他们当成宝贝。日本军国主义者和我们有八年的血海深仇，血迹还未干，血债还未清算，而美帝国主义者又和他们结成伙伴。美帝国主义者在朝鲜做尽了空前未有的残酷兽行，却依然在假仁假义地粉饰自己，并诬蔑我们中国人民为在朝鲜的“侵略者”。这就是美帝国主义者的倒行逆施，他们还妄想在中国人民中间进行挑拨离间，这不是只能证明他们自己的愚蠢吗？
    今天我们迎接着中国共产党建党三十周年纪念，我们借这个机会要向全中国全世界的人民宣告：我们中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，团结得像一个人一样了。经过建国以来将近两年的期间，大家得到了学习的机会，看到了自己的成就，我们全中国人民不分党派，不分阶层，不分族别，对于我们的伟大祖国中华人民共和国，对于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，我们的领导党——工人阶级先锋队的中国共产党，毫无保留地都表示着衷诚的拥护了。这衷诚无间的关系，决不是任何帝国主义者的阴谋诡计所能挑拨离间于万一的。
    纪念中国共产党建党三十周年纪念，我们要竭诚拥护毛主席，拥护中国共产党，拥护“共同纲领”，扩大并巩固我们的民主统一战线，加强并保卫我们的人民民主专政；在中国共产党的领导之下，迅速完成新民主主义的建设，把农业的中国转化成工业的中国，以便在适当时机过渡到更高阶段的社会主义的建设。
    纪念中国共产党建党三十周年纪念，我们要彻底反对美帝国主义；要更进一步深入我们的抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，鼓舞全中国人民加紧支援朝鲜人民的抗美的正义战争，务使这一战争得到胜利的结束；要尽力地反对美帝国主义重新武装日本；要解放台湾，彻底肃清釜底游魂的蒋介石匪帮。
    纪念中国共产党建党三十周年纪念，我们要加强我们的保卫世界和平运动，加强我们和苏联、各人民民主国家、各被压迫民族的联系，不断的扩大我们的和平运动的广泛基础，不断地揭露战争贩子们的罪恶阴谋，打击侵略政策，粉碎欺骗宣传，使帝国主义者所企图的第三次世界大战永远不能实现。
    纪念中国共产党建党三十周年纪念，我们要加紧学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学习共产党员全心全意为人民服务的精神，学习掌握批评与自我批评的犀利武器，把共产党一切优良的作风作为我们的模范，永远在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，努力工作，完成我们各个组织和个人的历史使命，达到我们共同的最高理想的目标。
    全中国人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
