　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: "Red Star Newspaper" published Bubonov's commentary on the Korean issue on the 3rd. The author said that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have inflicted huge losses in manpower and equipment on the American aggressors and their accomplices. American newspapers calculate that American forces have suffered losses of 140,000 men in the past eleven months. Some observers in Tokyo have concluded that the military operations in Korea are facing a dead end, and the US military command does not believe that victory is possible on the front lines. The commentary pointed out that the failure in Korea has caused a crisis in American foreign policy. The commentary said that the US's forcing the United Nations to pass embargoes against China and Korea and the US's drafting of a peace treaty with Japan prove that the US's ambition to expand its aggression in the East has not died. The commentary pointed out that the just struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against the aggressors is of great significance to the cause of peace.
