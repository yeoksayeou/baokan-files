The China Acrobatic Troupe visited the Soviet Union and Poland in late October last year, and then went to the Korean front to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, returning to Beijing at the end of last month.

The troupe was warmly welcomed and received by the people of various countries, and China's excellent folk acrobatic art was universally praised.

On November 6th last year, on the eve of the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, they arrived in the Soviet Union. Their first performance at the "Order of Lenin State Circus" in Moscow was highly praised by the Soviet people. Every performance in the circus showed the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people.

The Soviet Art Newspaper wrote on November 18th: "The friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union, which is becoming stronger day by day, has been demonstrated by the warm applause and particularly good results achieved by the actors of the China Acrobatic Troupe in Moscow. Not only in the Moscow circus, but also in other places in our country's capital, wherever the Chinese circus artists go, they are met with sympathy and love... The performance of the Chinese actors in Moscow has greatly helped and strengthened the fraternal unity of the freedom-loving people of the Soviet Union and China."

Soviet People's Artist M. Zharov wrote: "These days, a joyful atmosphere has been created in the Moscow circus... The acrobatic art of New China is vibrant and optimistic! Because it is connected with the lives of the people and originates from the people, it has the characteristics of the people's character."

Every program performed by the acrobatic troupe received excellent reviews. Among the most popular were Ge Shuwang's playing with jars, Jin Yeqin, Jin Ruqin, and Jin Shuqin's cycle stunts, Guan Yuhe's ring diving, and Cheng Shaolin and Cheng Xiaolin's head-top bowl towers. Soviet friends praised them in this way:

"We have seen many advanced juggling acts in the circus, such as the usual juggling of balls and sticks; but we have never seen the juggling of very heavy and large flowerpots, which Ge Shuwang performed with incomparable skill. This program is unique. I have not encountered such a complete and flawless program as Ge Shuwang's in the circus performances in Paris, Berlin, Barcelona, Hamburg, and other Western European cities. The confidence of this talented actor is remarkable. When he performs, it is difficult for people to find any difficulties in his performance. He throws several kilograms of flowerpots into the air, or balances them on his head, as if he were playing with a small ball." (Zoya Kokh)

During the days when the acrobatic troupe performed in Moscow, various newspapers in Moscow published news of the acrobatic troupe's performances and photos of various programs almost every day, and the portrait of the actor Ge Shuwang was displayed in many cultural stores in Moscow.

In the process of the performances, Soviet comrades enthusiastically helped our actors, which made the acrobatic troupe's performances in the Soviet Union a great success. In the three months in the Soviet Union, the troupe performed a total of 106 shows, with an audience of more than 276,800 people. In addition, countless viewers also saw the wonderful performances from radio facsimile and film documentaries. When the troupe left the Soviet Union, Soviet artists had completed the filming of a colorful art documentary, truthfully recording their performances.

In mid-February this year, the China Acrobatic Troupe went to Poland to perform. In half a month, they performed 24 shows in the Polish capital Warsaw, the Polish workers' city of Lodz, and other places.

On February 26th, the troupe performed at the Warsaw Military Club, and the audience was extremely crowded. When all the actors appeared on the stage, the audience immediately burst into warm applause and shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" The people of Warsaw also gave good reviews to the troupe's performances. Warsaw's "Special Evening News" wrote:

"There are no vulgar or terrifying programs in the programs performed by the China Acrobatic Troupe. Their programs are performed with skillful techniques and clever and intelligent movements. Therefore, what they perform is true art."

On the morning of March 1st, the troupe arrived in the Polish workers' city - the textile center of Lodz. At the Lodz railway station, the five-star red flag of New China was flying, and the station was crowded with workers who came to welcome them. Due to time constraints, only one performance was given here, and then they moved to Vratslav. During their performance, an old railway worker said to them with warmth and affection: "You are the excellent children of Mao Zedong. We have been looking forward to it, looking forward to it, and today we finally saw you and shook hands with you. We feel infinite luck and joy. Let us hold hands tightly to defend world peace and defend our banner of peace. This banner was exchanged for our flesh and blood, and we cannot let people take it away again! Let us wish the leaders of the Chinese and Polish people - Mao Zedong and Beirut - eternal health!"

At the end of March, the China Acrobatic Troupe decided to go to Korea to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on their way back to China. In early April, 51 members of the troupe went to Korea, which was fighting, with the delegation to comfort Korea.

The harsh combat environment was indeed a new test for them. They encountered many difficulties during the performances. But when they thought of the arduous fighting of countless heroic soldiers and the enthusiastic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea launched by the people of the motherland, they immediately generated a fighting force. In the face of constant enemy attacks, they marched day and night and gave performances to the troops.

The acrobatic troupe performed a total of 53 shows in Korea in one month. In early May, they returned to the motherland. After this field life training, the lives of each member of the troupe became richer and their political awareness was also improved. Many actors, such as Jin Yeqin, Jin Ruqin, Jin Shuqin, and Yin Yuhong, enthusiastically proposed to join the Volunteer Army. Some actors, such as Chen Laping, who practiced acrobatics, and Wu Zhenhua, who performed single-wheel bowl topping, used their efforts to improve their professional skills and political level to express their hatred for the enemy and their love for the motherland. After returning to China, they automatically launched a patriotic donation movement. Many actors (including band actors), such as Wu Zhenzhang, Zhang Wei, Wang Xiaosong, Yang Xiaoting, Yang Wenyuan, Zhang Wenqing, Jiang Yan, and Pan Yubao, enthusiastically donated their gold rings and saved money.

　　中华杂技团从国外归来
    本报记者　柏生
    中华杂技团在去年十月下旬离国访问了苏联、波兰，以后又到朝鲜前线慰劳朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在上月底回到了北京。
    该团在国外曾受到各国人民的热烈欢迎和接待；中国优秀的民间杂技艺术更获得了普遍的赞扬。
                    ★
    去年十一月六日，伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念日的前夕，他们到达了苏联。在莫斯科“列宁勋章国立马戏院”的首次演出，就受到了苏联人民的极高评价。在杂技场上的每一次演出，都表现出了苏联人民和中国人民的兄弟般的亲密友爱。
    苏维埃艺术报在十一月十八日撰文称：“一天比一天巩固起来的中苏两国伟大人民的友谊，已由中华杂技团的演员在莫斯科所获得的热烈的掌声和其特别好的成绩而显示出来了。不但在莫斯科马戏场里是这样，在我们祖国首都的其它地方，凡是中国马戏艺术家所到的场合，都会受到同情与爱戴…。中国演员在莫斯科的表演大大地帮助与巩固了爱好自由的苏中两国人民兄弟般的团结。”
    苏联人民演员米·日阿洛夫写道：“这些天来，在莫斯科马戏院里掀起了一种愉快的情绪，……新中国的杂技艺术是生气勃勃的、乐观主义的！因为它是和人民的生活相联系的，从人民中产生的，因此它就具有人民性格的特点。”
    杂技团所表演的每一个节目，都受到了极好的评论。其中最受欢迎的是演员佫树旺的耍坛子，金业勤、金汝勤、金淑勤的车技，以及关玉和的钻圈，程少林、程小林的头顶碗塔等。苏联朋友们这样地赞扬着：
    “我们在马戏场里曾看见过不少高级的玩耍东西，像平常所耍的球和棒；但是我们从未看见过玩耍很重、很大的花坛，而佫树旺以一种无可比拟的技巧表演了它。这个节目是无双的。我在巴黎、柏林、巴塞隆纳、汉堡以及其他的西欧城市的马戏院表演中，也没碰见过像佫树旺这个节目的如此完整无缺。这个天才演员的信心是值得注意的。在他表演时，人们难以发现他在表演时有些什么困难。他把好几公斤重的花坛子甩向空中，或用头顶，好像在玩一个小皮球似的。”（佐雅·高赫）
    当杂技团在莫斯科演出的那些日子里，莫斯科的各种报纸几乎每天都登有杂技团演出的消息和各种节目的照片，演员佫树旺的像片被陈设在莫斯科的许多文化商店里。
    在演出的过程中，苏联同志们热情地帮助我们的演员们，使得杂技团在苏联的演出得到了最大的成功。在苏联的三个多月里，该团共演出了一百零六场，观众达二十七万六千八百人以上。此外，无数的观众还从无线电传真和电影纪录片中看到了精彩的演出。当该团离开苏联时，苏联的艺术家们已完成了一部五彩艺术纪录片的拍摄工作，真实地纪录了他们的演出。
          ★
    今年二月中旬，中华杂技团又到波兰各地演出。半个月中，他们在波兰的首都华沙、波兰工人的城市洛基等地先后演出了二十四场。
    二月二十六日该团在华沙军人俱乐部演出，观众极为拥挤。当全体演员在舞台上出现时，观众立刻报以热烈的掌声，并高呼“毛泽东万岁！”华沙人民对该团的演出也都予以很好的评论。华沙《特别快晚报》写道：
    “中华杂技团所表演的节目中没有庸俗的与恐怖的节目。他们的节目是用熟练的技术与灵巧的智慧的动作来演出的。因此他们所表演的是真正的艺术。”
    三月一日上午，该团到达了波兰工人的城市——纺织业中心的洛基。在洛基车站，新中国的五星红旗在飘扬，站上挤满了前来欢迎的工人们。因为时间的限制，在这里只演出了一场，便转往弗拉兹洛夫城。在他们演出时，一个老铁路工人曾热情亲切地对他们说：“你们是毛泽东的优秀儿女。我们盼望着，盼望着，今天终于看到了你们，和你们握了手，我们感到无限的幸运和愉快。让我们紧紧地握起手来吧，保卫世界和平，保卫我们的和平的旗帜。这旗帜是用我们的血肉换来的，我们不能再叫人抢去！让我们祝中波两国人民领袖——毛泽东、贝鲁特永远健康！”
            ★
    三月底，中华杂技团在回国途中，又决定到朝鲜去慰问朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。四月初，有五十一个团员随赴朝慰问团到了正在战斗中的朝鲜。
    艰苦的战斗环境对于他们确是一个新的考验。在演出时，他们曾遇到了许多的困难。但当他们想到无数英勇战士们的艰苦作战和祖国人民热烈展开的抗美援朝运动的时候，便立即产生了一股战斗的力量。在敌人不断袭击的情况下，他们连夜行军赶路，还要给部队演出。
    杂技团在朝鲜的一个月中，共表演了五十三场。五月初，他们回到了祖国。经过这一次战地生活的锻炼，每个团员的生活更丰富了，政治觉悟也提高了。许多演员，如金业勤、金汝勤、金淑勤和尹钰宏等，都热烈地提出了参加志愿军的要求。有的演员，如练杂拌子的陈腊平和表演单车顶碗的吴振华等，都用努力提高业务和政治水平来表示他们对敌人的仇恨和对祖国的热爱。回国后，他们又自动地展开了爱国捐献运动。许多演员（包括乐队演员），如吴振章、张炜、王晓松、杨小亭、杨文元、张文清、蒋炎、潘玉宝等，都热情地捐出了自己的金戒指和节省下来的钱。（附图片）
