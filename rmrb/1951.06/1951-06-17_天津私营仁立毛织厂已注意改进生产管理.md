Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

Tianjin Private Renli Woolen Mill Has Paid Attention to Improving Production Management

Editor:

The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 10th published Comrade Lusheng's opinion to our factory, suggesting that "production management should be improved." This opinion is basically correct. To repay the readers for their concern, we would like to briefly report on the various work situations that have been improved or are being improved.

(1) Issue of temporary workers' promotion: In August last year, our factory's production operations were not yet normal, so we could not agree to promotions at that time. After mediation by the Labor Bureau and agreement between labor and management, wages were adjusted separately. The labor side made the request again in April this year. The current production situation is better than last year. Based on needs, the management has consulted and agreed with the labor side to promote 84% of the temporary workers to permanent workers, and has reported this to the Labor Bureau for approval.

(2) Wage issues: The egalitarian wage system seriously hinders production. Since April, engineers and responsible cadres from various workshops have been convened to discuss specific plans, and some progress has been made. Now, we have listed this work as one of the central tasks for the three months of June, July, and August.

(3) Regarding the organizational structure, we admit that there are many shortcomings, and we have decided to gradually improve it.

(4) In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the power of the working class. For example, when launching the factory cleaning campaign in the spring, we considered the difficulties too much beforehand. However, under the call of the trade union, everyone mobilized, not only solving all the problems but also winning the glorious title of second place in Tianjin. There are many other examples that have gradually increased our understanding. Regarding the issue of improving the production research group raised by Comrade Lusheng, we actually attach great importance to it. This group is composed of representatives from the Party, the trade union, the Youth League, and outstanding workers selected from various departments, totaling fifteen people (separated from production). From April 19th to June 11th, it has completed two phases of research and submitted various opinions in phases, providing them to labor and management for discussion and formulating improvement plans.

(5) "Regarding the production in 1950, the management told the trade union that it lost money, but actually earned more than 3 billion," therefore, it is believed that this is "the management's insincerity to the trade union." This statement may be due to a misunderstanding. In the first half of last year, Renli Woolen Textile Factory had a net loss of more than 280 million yuan, and only earned more than 500 million yuan at the end of the year. The issue was discussed before the end of the year, and the price of wool was very cheap at the beginning of last year and increased a lot at the end of the year. If calculated based on reproduction costs, it is still not profitable. The so-called profit of more than 3 billion is the comprehensive surplus of Renli Industrial Company (including the head office and branches, woolen mill, import and export department, carpet headquarters, etc.). This fact has already been discussed with the chairman of the trade union, and we would like to explain it here.

From the work in the past year, we have realized that: to quickly improve the old enterprises, we must rely on the masses of workers; to be able to undertake the tasks given by the new democratic economic construction, we must improve production management as soon as possible. Therefore, we thank Comrade Lusheng for the valuable criticism he has put forward.

### 天津私营仁立毛织厂已注意改进生产管理

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　天津私营仁立毛织厂已注意改进生产管理编辑同志：
    六月十日人民日报“读者来信”栏，刊登了鲁生同志对我厂提出“生产管理应改进”的意见。这个意见基本上是正确的。为了酬答读者对我们的关怀，我们愿意把已经改善的或正在改善中的各种工作情形简略报告一下。
    （一）临时工升工问题：在去年八月间，我厂生产业务还不正常，所以当时未能同意升工。后经劳动局调解，经劳资双方协议，分别调整了工资。今年四月间劳方再度提出要求。现时生产情况较去年好转，基于需要资方已和劳方协商同意，把百分之八十四的临时工升为长工，并已呈报劳动局听候批示中。
    （二）工资问题：平均主义的工资制度，严重地阻碍了生产。从四月起，已邀集了工程师、各车间负责干部会商具体方案，并已获有一些进展。现在，我们已经把这一工作列为六、七、八三个月的中心任务之一。
    （三）关于组织机构，我们承认有不少缺点，我们也决定逐步改善。
    （四）我们过去对工人阶级的力量重视得不够，例如春季发动工厂清洁运动，我们事前考虑困难太多。但是在工会号召之下，大家动员起来，不但解决了一切问题，而且获得了天津第二名的光荣称号。还有许许多多的例证，都使我们的认识逐步提高。鲁生同志所提的改进生产研究小组问题，事实上我们是相当重视的。这一小组是由党、工会、青年团代表和各部门选出优秀工友共十五人（脱离生产者）组成的。从四月十九日至六月十一日，已经完成了两期研究工作，并分期提出了各种意见，提供劳资双方讨论，作成改进方案。
    （五）“关于一九五○年的生产，资方对工会说是赔了钱，但实际是赚了三十多亿”，因此就认为这是“资方对工会不诚恳”。这种说法恐是出于误会。去年上半年，仁立毛呢纺织厂结账净赔二亿八千多万元，年终结算才赚了五亿多万元。谈问题的时候是在年终之前，而且去年年初羊毛很贱，年尾涨价很多，如按再生产成本计算，还是不赚钱的。所说赚了三十多亿，是仁立实业公司（包括总公司及分公司、毛呢厂、进出口部、制毯总部等）综合的盈余。这一事实，早已和工会主席谈过，愿在此说明一下。
    从一年以来的工作中，我们认识到：要想把旧企业迅速改善，必须依靠工人群众，要想能够担负新民主主义的经济建设所给予的任务，就必须及早改进生产管理。因此，我们感谢鲁生同志所提出的宝贵批评。
