The industrial workers in the Emilia region of Italy held a general strike on the afternoon of the 5th to protest the government's order to close the state-owned Lezzo Machine Factory for the benefit of the United States. Cities in the Emilia region also held rallies to protest industrial downsizing and mass layoffs.

Public bus and tram workers in Rome went on strike for two hours on the morning of the 7th, demanding higher wages. Public transportation throughout the city was paralyzed as a result.

More than 700 miners at a coal mine in South Wales, England, went on strike on the 7th to protest the coal mine authorities' order to transfer 97 workers elsewhere without consulting with the workers beforehand. Nine hundred workers at a coal mine near Dover also went on strike on the same day to protest being forced to leave the coal face and switch to lower-paying hauling work.

More than 10,000 long-distance truck drivers in the United Kingdom held a four-day strike at the end of last month to protest the state-owned management authority's establishment of special inspectors on the highways who violated drivers' rights. The strike brought all truck transportation in the London area and throughout southeastern and central England to a standstill. Under the resolute resistance of the workers, the management authority finally had to agree to abolish the inspectors.

　　资本主义国家的罢工运动
    意大利艾米利亚区产业工人于五日下午举行总罢工，抗议政府为了美国的利益而下令停闭公营勒佐机器制造厂。艾米利亚区各城市并纷纷举行大会抗议缩减工业和大批解雇工人。
    罗马的公共汽车和电车工人七日上午罢工两小时，要求增加工资。全市公共交通因而陷于瘫痪状态。
    英国南威尔士一个煤矿场的七百多名矿工于七日举行罢工，抗议煤矿当局事前不和工人商议就下令把九十七名工人调往别处。多维尔附近的一处煤矿场的九百名工人也在同一天罢工，抗议被迫离开矿面改作收入低的搬运工作。
    英国一万多名长途运货汽车司机上月底曾举行连续四天的罢工，抗议国营管理当局在公路上设置侵犯司机权利的特别稽查员。罢工使伦敦区以及英格兰东南部和中部的全部汽车运输都陷于停顿。管理当局在工人坚决的抵抗下终于不得不同意撤销稽查员。
