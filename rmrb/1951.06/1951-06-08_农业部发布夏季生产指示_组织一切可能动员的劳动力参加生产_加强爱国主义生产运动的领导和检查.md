The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government today issued "Instructions on Summer Production." The instructions stated: Agricultural activities across the country have entered the summer production phase. Due to floods in the south and droughts in the north this spring, the spring planting season was delayed, and seedlings are not thriving in most areas. At present, agricultural leading organs at all levels, in addition to actively arranging for summer harvesting and summer planting, must also seize the work of replanting and protecting seedlings, especially replanting all the cotton fields with missing seedlings. Therefore, this year's summer production work in various regions is very urgent and heavy. Agricultural leading organs at all levels must complete the following main tasks in summer production:

First, organize the masses to do a good job in summer harvesting and summer planting, ensuring timely harvesting, timely planting, and timely transplanting of rice seedlings; and do a good job in seed selection.

Second, in order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, especially an increase in cotton production, it is necessary to carry out timely mid-cultivation weeding, apply topdressing fertilizer, and trim cotton branches.

Third, mobilize the masses to vigorously prevent and control pests and diseases. Once pests are discovered in various places, various methods should be adopted immediately to eliminate them to ensure increased production. At present, locusts, rice stem borers, and cotton aphids have been found to be harmful to various crops in various places, therefore, they must be resolutely and promptly eliminated.

Fourth, some areas have changed from floods to droughts (such as Zhejiang and Hunan provinces), and some areas have changed from droughts to floods. Therefore, various places must carry out both drought and flood prevention work at the same time. In areas prone to flooding, dikes should be repaired and flood prevention should be strengthened, and attention should be paid to drainage; in areas likely to be affected by drought, canals should be built and wells should be dug vigorously, irrigation and water lifting tools should be increased, and irrigation management should be strengthened to achieve rational water use.

Fifth, according to the specific conditions in various places and the needs of the masses, carry out summer agricultural and sideline production, such as mobilizing the masses to universally accumulate fertilizer (compost and green manure); promote the planting of alfalfa in cotton-growing areas; and in pastoral areas, mobilize the masses to harvest summer grass and prepare winter feed for livestock.

The instructions stated: In order to complete the above-mentioned summer production tasks, agricultural leading organs at all levels must do the following two things well: First, organize all available full labor force, semi-labor force, and auxiliary labor force in rural areas to participate in agricultural production. To this end, various places must pay attention to developing and consolidating mutual aid organizations, resolutely implement the principle of voluntary and equivalent exchange, and rationally use labor. Various places should help the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and staff, as well as the elderly and orphans, solve the difficulties of lacking labor. At the same time, take advantage of agricultural gaps to hold small-scale labor model conferences and farmer symposiums, summarize and exchange production experiences, and promote summer production work. Second, strengthen the leadership and inspection of the patriotic production movement. Various places should take counties and districts as units, and carry out comparison and evaluation activities through summarizing spring sowing, summer harvesting, and summer planting, carefully check the implementation of production plans of various mutual aid groups, villages, and households, help them revise and supplement production plans, promote achievements, correct shortcomings, so as to make the patriotic production movement run through the whole year.

　　农业部发布夏季生产指示
    组织一切可能动员的劳动力参加生产
    加强爱国主义生产运动的领导和检查
    中央人民政府农业部今日发布“关于夏季生产指示”。指示称：全国农事活动已进入夏季生产阶段。由于今春南涝北旱，春耕播种时间延迟，大部地区禾苗不旺。目前各级人民政府农业领导机关除应积极布置夏收夏种外，还必须抓紧补苗保苗工作，特别是要把缺苗的棉田全部补种起来。因而，今年各地的夏季生产工作是非常紧迫和繁重的。各级人民政府农业领导机关在夏季生产工作中，必须完成以下几个主要任务：
    第一，组织群众把夏收夏种工作做好，做到及时收割，及时播种，及时插秧；并做好选种工作。
    第二，为了争取今年的丰收特别是棉花的增产，必须适时地进行中耕锄草、施追肥和修整棉枝。
    第三，发动群众大力防治病虫灾害。各地发现害虫后，应立即采用各种办法扑灭，以确保增产。目前各地已发现蝗虫、稻螟和棉蚜为害各种作物，因此，必须坚决地及早地予以消灭。
    第四，目前有的地区已转涝为旱（如浙江、湖南等省），有的地区已转旱为涝，因此各地必须同时进行防旱防涝工作。易受水灾地区，应加紧修堤防汛，注意排水；可能受旱地区，应大力修渠打井，增加灌溉提水工具，并加强灌溉管理，达到合理用水。
    第五，根据各地具体条件和群众的需要，开展夏季农副业生产，如发动群众普遍积肥（堆肥和沤绿肥）；在棉区提倡种植苜蓿；在畜牧区要发动群众收割伏草，准备好牲畜冬季饲料。
    指示称：为着完成上述夏季生产任务，各级农业领导机关必须做好以下两件工作：首先，要组织农村中一切可能动员的全劳动力、半劳动力和辅助劳动力参加农业生产。为此，各地必须注意发展和整顿互助组织，坚决贯彻自愿等价的原则，合理地使用劳动力。各地要帮助烈士、革命军人和工作人员的家属以及孤寡户解决缺乏劳动力的困难。同时，要利用农隙召开小型劳动模范会议、农民座谈会，总结和交流生产经验，推动夏季生产工作。其次，要加强爱国主义生产运动的领导和检查。各地应以县区为单位，通过总结春播、夏收和夏种等工作开展评比运动，认真检查各互助组及村、户生产计划的执行情况，帮助他们修正与补充生产计划，发扬成绩，纠正缺点，以便使爱国主义生产运动贯彻全年。
