　　A Gift for Children's Day
    Broadcast Speech on Central People's Broadcasting Station on May 31st
    Guo Moruo
    Children of all China! Tomorrow is June 1st, International Children's Day, a day for your unity and joy, and also a day for the unity and joy of children all over the world. I congratulate you on happily enjoying all the happiness you have today, and I hope even more that you will be able to enjoy even greater happiness in the future.
    A few days ago, friends asked me to write a song for your holiday. I wrote it, and Mr. Lü Ji set it to music. Tomorrow, you will sing it from your mouths. This can be said to be a small gift that I am giving to you. However, I still don't know if this gift will suit your taste. If it can suit your taste, then I will be extremely happy.
    Unfortunately, I can't sing, and I can't sing it according to Mr. Lü Ji's score. Let me recite it once now.
    Come, come, come! Come, come, come!
    Children of New China, come, come, come!
    Love our New China, love our new era!
    Love our New China, love our new era!
    We are like a hundred flowers blooming, how free and unrestrained we are!
    Come, come, come! Come, come, come!
    Children of the whole world, come, come, come!
    Come and live a new life, come and create a new world!
    Come and live a new life, come and create a new world!
    We are brothers and sisters, why distinguish between red, yellow, black, and white!
    Growing today, creating tomorrow!
    Study, study, and study again, study again!
    Exercise, exercise, and exercise again, exercise again!
    An even better world is in front of us!
    An even better world is in front of us!
    Children, I believe that you must understand these words. You are growing up in the People's Republic of China today, in such a brand-new era. How happy you are! Our People's Republic of China is like a spring garden. Children, you are like the flowers blooming in this garden. The sun is so bright, the air is so fresh, and our garden is full of flowers blooming, blooming so freely and unrestrainedly!
    Who earned us such a happy scene? Who should we thank? Children, you should know. We should thank Chairman Mao, thank the Chinese Communist Party, thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army, thank all the working uncles who are busy working in factories, mines, and other places, and thank the farmer uncles who cultivate the land and plant crops to produce grain and cotton for us. It was Chairman Mao who led the Chinese Communist Party, led the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and led the Chinese workers and peasants to drive away imperialism and overthrow the running dogs of imperialism, making our China a free and happy New China, becoming such a lovely garden. Our New China, children, is truly so lovely!
    Now, the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" has been signed, and the children of Tibet will also receive the same happiness. We only have Taiwan left, which has not yet been liberated and is still occupied by American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We must quickly liberate Taiwan so that the children of Taiwan can quickly receive the same happiness.
    Children, like our New China today, there are already many countries in the world where the working uncles and farmer uncles are in charge. The Soviet Union is the leader, and the workers and peasants there have been in charge for more than 30 years. In addition, in our East, there are Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and in Europe, there are Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic. The children of these countries, except for Korea which is suffering from disaster, are growing up freely and unrestrainedly and are very happy, just like the children of China.
    Children, you know that the children in northern Korea were also very happy, just like you, before July of last year. At the end of June last year, American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, just like a group of mad wild boars broke into a beautiful garden, completely ruining the happiness of the Korean people and Korean children. The Korean people and the Korean People's Army are bravely resisting American imperialism to eliminate that group of mad wild boars. The Chinese people have launched a movement to resist America and aid Korea, and our People's Volunteers have rushed to Korea to help the Korean people resist American imperialism and help eliminate that group of mad wild boars. Our purpose is to rescue the happiness of the Korean people and Korean children. We will definitely be able to do it. The American devils have been beaten to a pulp by our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.
    Children, all the children in the world are like brothers and sisters, and they should all enjoy the same free and unrestrained happiness. But because there is still imperialism in the world, countries like the United States, Britain, and France, are a very small number of selfish people sitting on the heads of workers and peasants, sitting on the heads of many weak nations, acting like overlords. Not only are the countries they invade suffering from disaster, but the workers and peasants and most of the children within those countries are also suffering. Therefore, we ardently hope that all the weak nations in the world can be liberated, that all the workers and peasants in the world can stand up, and that all the children in the world can have a happy life. We want to make the whole world a beautiful garden.
    This can only be done with our joint efforts. Good days will not come by themselves. We cannot sit and wait. We must strive, create, and overthrow imperialism.
    Children, although you are still young today, still in the age of growth, you must prepare well: you must study hard and exercise well. With a good body and good studies, you will have great abilities to create a new world. "Growing today, creating tomorrow." Today, we must grow up with both body and spirit fully developed, and tomorrow, we will create a new world, an even better world.
    Children of all China, as long as everyone can unite and work hard, a free and happy whole new world can be created. In our generation, we have seen the great liberation of the Chinese people. In your generation, we will see the great liberation of all the people in the world. At that time, the world will be truly peaceful.
    Today's children, tomorrow's heroes. I sincerely wish you to study diligently, study, and study again, exercise, exercise, and exercise again! Unite happily and make all preparations: first, to consolidate the victory of our New China, and further strive to create a new world of freedom, equality, peace, and happiness.

　　献给儿童节的礼物
    五月三十一日在中央人民广播电台的广播辞
    郭沫若
    全中国的小朋友们！明天是六月一日，是国际儿童节，是你们团结愉快的日子，也是全世界的小朋友们团结愉快的日子。我祝贺你们高高兴兴的享受你们今天所有的幸福，更希望你们在将来能够享受更大的幸福。
    前几天朋友们要我给你们的节日做一首歌，我做出了，而且由吕骥先生把它谱出了，明天就会由你们口里把它唱出来的。这可以说是我送给你们的一个小小的礼物。不过我还不知道这个礼物能不能够合你们的口胃，假使能够合你们的口胃，那我真是再高兴也没有了。
    可惜我是不会唱歌的，我不能够照着吕骥先生的谱子把它唱出来，现刻就请让我把它朗诵一遍吧。
    来来来，来呀！来来来，来呀！
    新中国的小朋友，来来来呀！
    爱我们的新中国，爱我们的新时代！
    爱我们的新中国，爱我们的新时代！
    我们象百花齐开，多么地自由自在呀！
    来来来，来呀！来来来，来呀！
    全世界的小朋友，来来来呀！
    来过新的生活，来造个新世界！
    来过新的生活，来造个新世界！
    我们是兄弟姊妹，分什么红黄黑白呀！
    成长的今天，创造的明天！
    学习学习再学习，再学习呀！
    锻炼锻炼再锻炼，再锻炼呀！
    更美满的天地就在我们的前面！
    更美满的天地就在我们的前面！
    小朋友们，这些辞儿，我相信，你们一定是懂得的。你们生长在中华人民共和国的今天，这样崭新的一个时代，你们是多么地幸福呀！我们的中华人民共和国就象一座春天的花园，小朋友们，你们就象在这花园里面开着的花。太阳是这样的明朗，空气是这样的新鲜，我们满园子的花都开放着，开放得真是自由自在的呀！
    这样幸福的光景，是什么人为我们争取得来的？我们应该感谢什么人呢？小朋友们，你们应该是知道的。我们就应该感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党，感谢中国人民解放军，感谢在工场里、矿山里和其它地方忙着做工的一切工人大伯伯，感谢在田地里耕田种土，为我产粮食、产棉花的农民大伯伯。是毛主席领导着中国共产党，领导着中国人民解放军，领导着中国的工人农民大众，把帝国主义赶跑了，把帝国主义的走狗打倒了，使我们的中国成为了自由幸福的新中国，成为了这样可爱的一座花园。我们的新中国，小朋友们，真是多么地可爱呀！
    现在“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”已经签字了，西藏的小朋友们也就会得到同样的幸福了。我们就只剩下了一个台湾还没有解放，还被美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮霸占着，我们一定要赶快解放台湾，好让台湾的小朋友们也赶快得到同样的幸福。
    小朋友们，象我们新中国今天这样，工人大伯伯、农民大伯伯当了家的国家，在世界上已经不少了。苏联是带头的、那里的工人农民已经当家了三十多年。在这之外，在我们东方还有朝鲜、蒙古、越南，在欧洲还有波兰、匈牙利、捷克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴利亚、德意志民主共和国。这些国家的小朋友们，除掉朝鲜在受着灾难之外，都象我们中国的小朋友们一样，是自由自在地成长着，非常幸福的。
    小朋友们，你们是知道的：就是朝鲜北部的小朋友们，在去年七月以前，也和你们一样是很幸福的。在去年六月底美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，就象一群发了疯的野猪闯进了一座美丽的花园，把朝鲜人民和朝鲜儿童的幸福，完全糟踏了。朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军正英勇地反抗美帝国主义，要消灭那一群发了疯的野猪。我们中国人民发动了抗美援朝的运动，我们的人民志愿军赶到朝鲜去，正帮助朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义，帮助消灭那一群发了疯的野猪。我们的目的，就是要把朝鲜人民和朝鲜儿童的幸福，抢救出来。我们是一定能够做到的。美国鬼子已经被我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打得个落花流水了。
    小朋友们，全世界的小朋友都是和兄弟姊妹一样的，都应该一样地享受自由自在的幸福。但就因为在世界上还有帝国主义存在，就象美国、英国、法国那样的国家，是极少数自私自利的人坐在工人农民的头上，坐在好些弱小民族的头上，作威作福。不仅被它们侵略的国家受着灾难，就是那些国家内部的工人农民和大部分的小朋友们也同样受着灾难。所以我们热烈地希望全世界的弱小民族都能够解放，全世界的工人农民都能够翻身，全世界的小朋友都能够过幸福的好日子。我们要使全世界整个儿成为一座美好的花园。
    这是要我们共同努力才能够办得到的。好日子自己不会来，我们不能够坐着等待，我们一定要争取，要创造，要把帝国主义打倒。
    小朋友们，你们今天虽然还小，还是在成长的年代，但你们要好好地准备着：要好好地读书，好好地锻炼身体。身体好，书读的好，才有大的本领去创造新的世界。“成长的今天，创造的明天”。在今天要使身体和精神都饱满地成长起来，到了明天就要创造新的世界，更美满的天地。
    全中国的小朋友们，只要大家能够团结，肯努力，自由幸福的整个的新世界是能够创造出来的。在我们的一代，我们看见了中国人民的大翻身，在你们的一代我们会看见全世界人民的整个大翻身。到了那个时候，全世界也就真正和平了。
    今天的儿童，明天的英雄。我诚恳地祝福你们，认真地学习、学习、再学习，锻炼、锻炼、再锻炼！愉快地团结起来，作好一切的准备：首先是把我们新中国的胜利巩固起来，更进一步为创造自由、平等、和平、幸福的新世界而努力奋斗。
