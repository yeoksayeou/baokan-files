　　A Good Team

　　There used to be a saying in the performing arts circles: "I'd rather lead a thousand troops than a troupe of variety performers." This "strange saying" has now been overturned by the performing arts circles' mission to North Korea for慰問 [comforting the troops]. The liberated performing arts circles have used their actions to demonstrate that they are a good team, a brave and skilled force guided by Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art!

　　When the performing arts circles heard the news of going to North Korea for 慰問 [comforting the troops], they scrambled to sign up and seize the opportunity to work! Mr. Meng Xianyou (Quick Hands Liu), a magician in his seventies, had never left Beijing before, but this time he insisted on going. He was even happier when he put on his military uniform, constantly asking others: "Do I look like an old soldier?" When he was in Shenyang, he went to the hospital to offer 慰問 [comfort the troops], and Mr. Meng went to each ward to perform sleight of hand, which was very popular. When he arrived at the front, whenever he went on stage, the soldiers, knowing his age, would call him "Old Dad!" He was often moved to tears because Mr. Meng had no children, and no one had ever called him "Dad" before. The soldiers' enthusiasm also boosted Mr. Meng's work spirit. Once, a unit only asked for storytelling programs due to performance conditions, but he insisted on going along. As a result, he still performed magic, which was very popular. Mr. Meng's team was led by Mr. Lian Kuoru. One of the zither players in the team, Li Yancheng, was a cripple. The performing arts actors in other teams were often worried about Mr. Lian's team. When they finished their work and gathered in Shenyang, they exchanged information, and everyone applauded because Li Yancheng never fell behind, and Quick Hands Liu was popular everywhere! At the same time, this team did as much work as any other team!

　　Calm

　　In an area near Pyongyang, we held an evening party to entertain the Volunteer Army. The venue was brightly lit, and everyone was chatting and laughing. Suddenly, an air raid alarm went off in the city. According to the regulations, the venue should be blacked out, so the lights were turned off. The people's air defense forces immediately organized a powerful firepower network in the air, and the enemy planes had to flee in a panic. When the lights came back on, everyone was about to start talking and laughing again, but they were stunned. It turned out that before the air raid, Yin Yuhong and Liu Youqing, members of the General Political Department's Art Troupe, were juggling plates on stage. Each of them was juggling eight plates. When the lights went out, they had no way to stop and continued to juggle. Any slight panic would have caused all the plates to shatter. But even amidst the rumbling of artillery fire and in complete darkness, they still juggled very well, which required a high degree of calm! Therefore, when the lights came back on and everyone saw that the sixteen plates on the stage were still spinning, they were stunned, followed by a tidal wave of cheers and applause. Everyone was excited about the people's actors' high degree of calm.

　　The acrobatic troupe that followed the General Political Department was marching to a place where they had to disperse and camp. Gu Rongfu and Yin Fulai, two partners, found a small air-raid shelter, which was located in a small basin at the foot of the mountain. Apricot blossoms and azaleas were blooming everywhere, and there were many pine and cypress trees. It was drizzling, and the scenery was extremely beautiful. As the two were admiring the scenery, an enemy plane came to wander around. They cursed and were about to enter the shelter when they suddenly discovered a box of shells that the American devils had abandoned while fleeing. They slowly carried it to a nearby ditch, preparing to hand it over to the troops later. They walked back, entered the shelter, lit a foreign candle, heated water in a military kettle, and composed new lyrics while waiting for the water to heat up. The lyrics for "Jin Shengyun Shoots Down the Plane" were created in the small cave.

　　Overcoming Difficulties

　　When they arrived at the front, it was easier to perform storytelling programs, but more difficult to practice martial arts routines. One day, they entertained the soldiers in a mountain cave. They first performed several storytelling programs, and the soldiers shouted slogans and applauded after each program. The martial arts actors couldn't hold back and asked to perform. The cave had a low ceiling, insufficient light, an uneven ground, and rocks protruding in all directions, making it difficult to practice. However, they still practiced flying forks, shuttlecocks, and plate spinning with great enthusiasm, which made the soldiers very happy. The actors Wang Qingyuan and Song Huiling both said, "This is our achievement in learning from the soldiers to overcome difficulties!" The most difficult routine to practice was "Head Juggling," but the actor Jin Zhen still performed the very difficult "Egg Breaking" under such conditions! The cave ceiling was very low, so he knelt on the ground to juggle. There was insufficient light, so he lit two more candles. As a result, he practiced very successfully. Everyone said, "There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome!"

　　Evening Party in the Mountain Gully

　　On the evening of May Day, an evening party was held on a high ground to entertain the Volunteer Army comrades. More than a thousand soldiers arrived successively after dusk. The actors also changed into their performance costumes and sat in circles at the venue. This was simply a demonstration to the enemy planes, which were flying around like headless flies. After the carbide lamps and mast lights were lit at the venue, the performance began. The actors all thought, "Today is Labor Day, and the soldiers have traveled so far to attend the meeting, we should put in more effort!"

　　There were air defense observation posts on the highest mountain peaks. Two shots were fired when an enemy plane came, and one shot was fired after the enemy plane left. When they heard two shots, the lights were turned off, and the meeting was suspended. When they heard the all-clear signal, the lights were immediately turned on, and the performance continued. While Hou Baolin was telling a comic dialogue, an enemy plane came. Baolin said, "This grandson is afraid that we are tired and is inviting us to take a break!" Everyone laughed.

　　The meeting proceeded victoriously in such a combat atmosphere. Baolin told the first two volumes of dramatic stories, and also added a newly compiled piece called "Lackey Li Chengwan." Gao Yuanjun told the upper and lower volumes of Shandong fast-clapper talk, "Wu Song Disguised as a Girl," and also added three short pieces. It was very cold in the mountain gully at night, and the actors were sweating profusely from talking and practicing. The soldiers were also happy to listen and satisfied to watch. We held many such spirited meetings. The actors in the performing arts circles became stronger and stronger in such venues. At the same time, they practiced the slogan of serving the soldiers with performing arts!

　　Turning Grief into Strength

　　Among the actors in the acrobatic troupe that followed the General Political Department, several heard about the sacrifice of Mr. Chang Baokun and Mr. Cheng Shutang relatively early from the logistics staff after marching past Pyongyang. Among the actors who knew the news were close friends of the two martyrs, Chang and Cheng: comic dialogue actor Hou Baolin and Shandong fast-clapper talk master Gao Yuanjun. They did not make a sound at the time because others would be sad and would affect the work if they knew. They hoped that the news was not true. If it was true, they should compensate for the loss of the two martyrs with redoubled efforts! After passing Pyongyang, Baolin and Yuanjun tried to talk more and perform more when they visited the Volunteer Army. It was a way of working for the two martyrs, Chang and Cheng.

　　On the morning of returning to Andong, everyone knew the news of the two martyrs' sacrifice. The next day, following the General Political Department, they went to Zhenjiangshan to mourn the coffins of the two martyrs, Chang and Cheng, which were temporarily placed in the Martyrs' Cemetery. A solemn and simple ceremony was held. Everyone remembered the speech of the head of the delegation: "Turn grief into strength and avenge the martyrs with action!"

　　Baolin originally planned to return to Beijing to reorganize the comic dialogue group and performance positions first. Yuanjun planned to return to Nanjing to see his wife, whom he had been separated from for a year and who was about to give birth. After returning to Tianjin, after hearing the great call to go to all parts of the country to publicize, they responded to the call together with the entire performing arts circles. Because this was more important than anything else, this was another opportunity to strike the enemy with action and avenge the sacrificed relatives! The performing arts circles have expanded the performing arts troupe that went to various parts of the country to publicize to two hundred and eighty people. They hoped to accept the glorious task of a second visit to North Korea for 慰問 [comforting the troops]. The old artist Meng Xianyou said it well: "Even if I live to be ninety, I have to work!"

　　受志愿军热烈欢迎的曲艺大队
           沈彭年
    一支好队伍
    曲艺界里以前流行过一句话：“宁带千军万马，不带十样杂耍。”这句“怪话”现在已经被曲艺界赴朝慰问的行动给取消了。翻了身的曲艺界已经用自己的行动来说明自己是好队伍，是毛泽东文艺思想指导下的英勇善战的队伍！
    曲艺界听到了赴朝慰问的消息，真是争先恐后地报名，争取工作的机会！变戏法的孟宪友老先生（快手刘）已经七十多岁了，是从来不出北京的大门的，这一回却坚持要去。老先生换上了军装的时候更是高兴，老问别人：“像老兵不像？”住在沈阳的时候，到医院去慰问，老先生就到每个病房里变手彩，大受欢迎。到了前方，每逢他上场，战士们知道了他的年岁以后，都喊他“老爸爸！”他常常是感动得流泪，因为老先生没有儿女，从来没有人喊过他“爸爸”。战士们的热情也鼓舞了老先生的工作精神。有一次，有个单位因为演出条件的关系，只要求听说唱节目，他却非跟去不可。结果，他仍然表演了戏法，而且大受欢迎。孟老先生这一队是由连阔如先生领导的。队里还有一位坠子琴师李炎城是跛子。别的队的曲艺界演员常常是想起连先生这一队就不放心。作完工作到沈阳会师的时候，一交换情况，大家都鼓起掌来。因为李炎城从来不掉队，快手刘到处受欢迎！同时，这一队比其余的任何一队干的活儿也不少！
  镇静
    我们在平壤附近的地方，开晚会招待志愿部队，会场里灯光辉煌，谈笑风生。忽然，城里拉了警报。照规矩，会场应该熄灯，于是灯就灭了。人民的空防部队立刻在空中组织了强大的火力网，敌机只好抱头鼠窜而去。会场里灯又亮了，大家才又要大说大笑，却又楞住了。原来，在防空之前，总团文工团员尹玉宏、刘有庆正在台上耍横碟子。每人都耍的是八个碟子，灯灭了，他们没有办法停下来，就继续耍，稍一心慌，就会把碟子都摔得稀烂。但是就在炮声隆隆的情况下，而且眼前漆黑，他们仍旧耍得很好，这需要高度的镇静！所以电灯大放光明之后，大家一看台上的十六只碟子仍然在旋转就楞了，继之而起的是潮水般的彩声和掌声。大家是为了人民演员的高度镇静而兴奋。
    随总团走的曲艺队，行军到了一个地方，要分散宿营。顾荣甫、尹福来两个伙伴找到一个小防空洞，那地方是山脚下的一片小盆地，杏花、迎山红开成一片，松柏树也多，天正在下小雨，风景真是美极了。两个人正在看风景，一架敌机又来瞎转悠了，骂了一句街就要进洞子。忽然发现洞外有一箱美国鬼子逃命时扔下的炮弹，就慢慢的把它抬到不远的一个河沟旁边，准备等会儿交给部队。走回来，进了洞子，点了个洋腊头热上行军壶里的水，一边等水热，一边编新词儿。等水热了，词也编了一大段。“金胜云打飞机”就是在小洞子里生产出来的作品。
  克服困难
    到了前方，表演说唱节目比较方便，练武活儿比较困难。有一天在一个山洞里招待战士，先演了几个说唱节目，每结束一个节目，战士们就高呼口号鼓掌。练武活儿的演员实在忍不住了，纷纷要求表演。在山洞里顶子低，光线不足，地面不平，前后左右的石头又七出八进的，实在不好练，但是，飞叉，毽子，顶碗，仍然都大练了一气，战士们非常高兴。演员里的王清源、宋蕙玲都说：“这是我们向战士学习克服困难的成绩！”最难练的是“顶扔杂技”，可是演员金震就在那样的条件下也还是表演了很不好练的“打鸡蛋”！山洞顶很低，就跪在地下顶；光线不足，就多点两支腊。结果也练得很圆满。大家都说：“没有克服不了的困难！”
  山沟里的晚会
    五一节的晚上，在一个高地上开晚会招待志愿军同志。一千多位战士在黄昏以后就陆续到会了。演员们也都换了表演服在会场上团团围坐。这对于没脑袋苍蝇似的，瞎飞乱撞的敌机简直是一个示威。会场上点亮了电石灯、桅灯之后，就开始了表演。演员们都想：“今天是劳动节，战士们又跑这末远的路来开会，应该多卖力气！”
    最高的山头上都有对空监视哨，敌机来时就打两枪，敌机滚蛋之后就打一枪。听到两声枪就熄灯，休会，听到解除的信号就马上点灯、进行表演。正在侯宝林说相声的时候，敌机来了。宝林说：“这孙子怕咱们累着，请咱们休息休息！”大家都笑了。
    会程就是在这样的战斗气氛中，胜利的进行着，宝林说了头二本的戏剧杂学，还饶了一个新编小段儿叫“狗腿子李承晚”。高元钧说了上下本的山东快书，《武松装姑娘》，还饶了三个小段儿。山沟里到夜间很冷，演员们都说得练得满头大汗。战士们也听得高兴，看得满意。我们开了许许多多这样精神饱满的会，曲艺界的演员们就在这样的会场里，锻炼得越来越坚强，同时，实践了曲艺为战士服务的口号！
  把悲愤变成力量
    跟着总团走的曲艺队，有几位演员在行军过了平壤以后，较早地从后勤工作人员那里听到了常宝坤程树棠二先生牺牲的消息。几位知道消息的演员里有常程二烈士生前的知己：相声演员侯宝林和山东快书名家高元钧。他们当时都没动声色。因为别人知道了，也会难过，会影响工作；希望这消息不真；万一是真，自己应该以加倍的工作来补偿二烈士的损失！宝林、元钧过了平壤以后，慰问志愿部队的时候，努力说，多表演，是有替常程二烈士工作的意思的。
    回到安东的早晨，大家都知道了两位烈士牺牲的消息。第二天，随着总团到镇江山去吊祭浮厝在烈士公墓的常程二烈士的灵柩。举行了严肃简单的仪式，大家都记住了团首长的讲话：“把悲愤变成力量，用行动来替烈士报仇！”
    宝林原先计划着回到北京，先整顿相声小组和演出阵地；元钧计划着回到南京去看一看阔别一年，即将生产的爱人。回到天津，听到和大号召到全国各地去宣传的消息以后，他们就和全体曲艺界一道响应了号召。因为，这比什么都重要，这是又一次用行动来打击敌人，为牺牲的亲人报仇的机会！曲艺界已经把到全国各地去宣传的曲艺队扩充到二百八十人。他们更希望能接受第二次赴朝慰问的光荣任务。老艺人孟宪友说的好：“活得九十，我也得干！”
