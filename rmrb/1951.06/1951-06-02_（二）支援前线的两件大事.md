　　(II) Two Major Tasks in Supporting the Front Lines
    The Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has issued an important proclamation, suggesting that a patriotic convention movement be launched throughout the country, and at the same time suggesting that a donation campaign for airplanes and artillery be carried out nationwide, to do a good job of giving preferential treatment to revolutionary soldiers and families of martyrs, as well as disabled soldiers, and to include these two major tasks of supporting the front lines in the patriotic convention. This call from the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is extremely important. We hope that the people of the whole country will unanimously and enthusiastically express their support with actions, and contribute even greater strength to support the front lines, to strive for the early realization of the final victory of the war to resist U.S. aggression.
    Over the past six months, the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved great success. Together, our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have eliminated more than 200,000 enemy troops. Coordinating with the victory on the Korean front, the majority of the people of the whole country have participated in the anti-American and patriotic ranks. According to incomplete statistics of the materials received by the end of May, the number of people participating in rallies to denounce the Japanese and American aggressors, signing petitions to support the conclusion of a peace treaty, and voting on the Japanese issue has exceeded 240 million; more than 200 million people have also participated in patriotic demonstrations and parades. In this patriotic upsurge, the people of the whole country support the Volunteer Army's operations in various ways, and participate with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm in consolidating national defense, eliminating the feudal land system, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, developing industrial and agricultural production, studying politics and culture, eliminating imperialist aggressive forces and influences in China, and promoting the accelerated advancement of all these struggles and construction work. But despite the fact that our people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and defend our homes and country has repeatedly frustrated the enemy, the enemy has still not accepted the lesson of defeat. American imperialists still insist on occupying Taiwan, invading Korea, and continuing to threaten the security of our motherland and world peace. Under such circumstances, our compatriots across the country must continue to expand and deepen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. First of all, we must contribute even greater strength to support the Volunteer Army's operations, using the united strength of 475 million people to overwhelm the enemy and strive for victory.
    The first important practical work to support the front lines is to donate weapons to kill the enemy, such as airplanes, tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and anti-tank guns. As the proclamation of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea pointed out, this movement should be closely combined with the patriotic production increase movement, using a portion or all of the newly increased income to donate and purchase weapons to support the front lines. In order to quickly and widely develop this movement, all cities, counties, and banners in the country should convene a representative conference of people from all walks of life to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in June to discuss and formulate plans to increase production and donate weapons in the second half of this year, and mobilize the masses to make every effort to ensure that every household and every person formulates such a plan. When initiating the formulation of plans, it should proceed from the actual situation of all sectors and industries, and should be based on the consciousness and voluntariness of the masses. For example, in rural areas, it should be promoted to increase agricultural, household handicraft, and other sideline production, and to donate a part of the increased production in half a year to support the front lines. For workers and staff, it can be promoted to work one more day each month to support the Volunteer Army, and to use the wages earned to support the front lines. For industrialists, businessmen, and financiers, it can be promoted to improve management, save on consumption, and donate the profits of one or several days each month to support the Volunteer Army, and those with sufficient financial resources are welcome to donate airplanes, artillery, or other weapons individually. For the cultural and artistic circles, it can be promoted to write more, draw more, and perform more for the support of the Volunteer Army, and to use the income earned to support the front lines. Adopting this method of launching a donation movement in combination with increasing production can concentrate the strength of 475 million people to purchase a large number of weapons such as airplanes, tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and anti-tank guns, and send them to the front lines, so that the Volunteer Army can more effectively strike the enemy and annihilate the enemy; at the same time, it can not only not affect the country's construction and the people's lives, but also strengthen the country's construction and improve the people's lives.
    Another important task in supporting the front lines is to conscientiously and regularly do a good job of giving preferential treatment and pensions to the families of revolutionary soldiers (including officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the People's Public Security Forces), the families of revolutionary martyrs, and disabled soldiers. Because only in this way can the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army and the Liberation Army not be distracted by the difficulties in the lives of their families, and thus can wholeheartedly eliminate the enemy and defend the motherland. As the proclamation of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea pointed out: The officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, the Liberation Army, and the People's Public Security Forces have left their homes and sacrificed their blood for the sake of defending our motherland and the happy lives of our people. Therefore, the people of the whole country must be fully responsible for their families and for the disabled soldiers. In order to regularly do a good job in preferential treatment work, the representative conferences of people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the people's representative conferences in all cities, counties, and banners must discuss this work, formulate plans to do a good job in this work in the second half of this year, and mobilize every relevant village and street to formulate plans. In rural areas, it is necessary to do a good job in cultivating land on behalf of the families of martyrs and soldiers; in cities, it is necessary to help the families of martyrs and soldiers solve employment problems. Whether in rural or urban areas, it is necessary to help the children of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary martyrs to enroll in schools and pursue further education. All people's organizations and all patriotic activists must assist governments at all levels to regularly publicize, mobilize, supervise, and inspect preferential treatment work.
    Supporting the front lines and defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen. We call on compatriots across the country, regardless of gender, age, or social status, to support the front lines and to contribute even greater strength to support the front lines! As long as our 475 million people unite and act with one heart and one mind under the great banner of patriotism, the enemy will surely be completely defeated by us, and the final victory will surely belong to us.

　　（二）支援前线的两件大事
    中国人民抗美援朝总会已经发出重要文告，建议在全国普遍开展爱国公约运动，同时建议在全国开展捐献飞机大炮运动，做好优待革命军人和烈士家属及残废军人的工作，并将这两项支援前线的大事订入爱国公约之内。抗美援朝总会的这个号召，十分重要，我们希望全国人民一致热烈地以行动来表示拥护，拿出更大的力量来支援前线，来争取抗美战争最后胜利的早日实现。
    半年多来，抗美援朝的爱国运动已经获得很大成绩。我国志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，已经消灭了二十多万敌军。与朝鲜前线的胜利相配合，全国人民的大多数已经参加反美爱国的行列中。到五月底为止所收到材料的不完全统计，参加控诉日、美侵略者的集会、举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名及对日问题投票的人数，即已超过二亿四千万人；参加爱国示威游行，亦在二万万人以上。在这个爱国高潮中，全国的人民，以各种方式支援志愿军的作战，并以空前的革命积极性参加巩固国防、消灭封建土地制度、镇压反革命活动、发展工农业生产、学习政治文化、肃清帝国主义在华侵略势力及影响工作，推动这一切斗争和建设工作的加速前进。但是尽管我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争已经使得敌人一再挫败，敌人仍然没有接受失败的教训。美国帝国主义者仍然坚持霸占台湾、侵略朝鲜，继续威胁着我们祖国的安全和世界的和平。在这样的情况下，我们全国同胞必须再接再厉地扩大和深入抗美援朝的斗争，首先就是要拿出更大的力量来支援志愿军的作战，用四亿七千五百万人团结一致的力量来压倒敌人，争取胜利。
    支援前线的第一个重要的实际工作，就是捐献飞机、坦克、大炮、高射炮、反坦克炮等项杀敌武器。正如抗美援朝总会的文告所指出，这一运动应与爱国增产运动紧密结合起来，以新增加收入的一部或全部，捐献出来，购买武器，支援前线。为使这一运动迅速普遍地开展，全国各市、县、旗都应于六月份内召开一次各界人民的抗美援朝代表会议，来讨论并制订在今年下半年增加生产捐献武器的计划，并发动群众尽可能做到每户每人都制订这样的计划。发起制订计划时，应该从各界各业的实际情况出发，并应根据群众的自觉和自愿。例如在农村，应提倡增加农业、家庭手工业及其他副业生产，以半年增产所得的一部分，捐献出来，支援前线。对于工人、职员可提倡每月为支援志愿军多做工一天，以所得工资支援前线。对于工商金融业者，可提倡改善经营，节约消费，每个月以一天或数天的盈利捐献出来，支援志愿军，并欢迎其中有足够资力者单独捐献飞机、大炮或其他武器。对于文化界艺术界，可提倡为支援志愿军而多写稿、多画画、多演戏，以所得收入支援前线。采取这种与增加生产相结合的办法来发动捐献运动，就能集中四亿七千五百万人民的力量，购置大量的飞机、坦克、大炮、高射炮、反坦克炮等武器，送到前线去，使志愿军能够更有力地打击敌人、歼灭敌人；同时，又可以不但不致影响国家的建设和人民的生活，而且加强国家的建设，改善人民的生活。
    支援前线的另一项重要任务，就是要认真地、经常地做好优待和抚恤革命军人（包括中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军、人民公安部队的军官及士兵）家属、革命烈士家属和残废军人的工作。因为只有这样，才能使志愿军和解放军的将士们，不致因为家属的生活困难而分心，因而可以全心全意地去消灭敌人、拱卫祖国。正如抗美援朝总会的文告所指出：志愿军、解放军、人民公安部队的将士们，离乡背井、流血牺牲，都是为了保卫我们祖国和我们全国人民的幸福生活，因此，我们全国人民就必须对于他们的家属、对于残废军人完全负责。为了经常做好优抚工作，各市、县、旗的抗美援朝代表会议和人民代表会议都必须讨论这个工作，订出今年下半年做好这一工作的计划，并发动每个有关的村庄和街道都订出计划来。在农村中，要做好为烈属军属代耕的工作，在城市中，要帮助烈属军属解决职业问题。无论在农村或城市，都要帮助革命军人和革命烈士的子女入学和升学。各人民团体和一切爱国积极分子，都要协助各级政府，经常地宣传动员和督促检查优抚工作。
    支援前线，保卫祖国，这是每一个国民的神圣职责。我们号召全国同胞，不分男女老少，人人都来支援前线，人人都拿出更大的力量来支援前线！只要我们四亿七千五百万人万众一心地在伟大的爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，行动起来，敌人一定可以被我们完全打败，最后的胜利一定属于我们。
