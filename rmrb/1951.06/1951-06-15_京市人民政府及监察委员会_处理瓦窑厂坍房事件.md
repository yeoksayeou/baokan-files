　　Beijing Municipal People's Government and Supervision Committee
    Handle the Tile Factory Collapse Incident
    [Our newspaper's dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: After the collapse of the drying shed at the brick and tile factory in the northern suburbs of the Materials Department of the Beijing Yongmao Construction Company, which resulted in worker deaths and injuries, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Government immediately sent people to the site to investigate and express condolences to the injured workers. At the same time, they instructed the relevant authorities to handle the aftermath and investigate the responsibility for the accident. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Construction Bureau, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal People's Court, and the Beijiao Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent people to the site to investigate. The factory has rushed the injured workers to the hospital for treatment. After an autopsy by the Beijing Municipal People's Court, the company was responsible for encoffining and burying the deceased. Regarding the issue of compensation, the company has consulted with the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau and agreed to pay the family members six months' salary of the deceased in accordance with the provisions of the labor insurance regulations.
    On June 5th and 7th, Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, successively convened meetings of relevant units to study the causes of the incident and the responsibility for the accident, and put forward preliminary handling opinions. Everyone at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the incident occurred in a municipal public enterprise, and its nature is very serious. The main reason for the incident is that Qian Zhengrong, the person in charge of the factory, was irresponsible to the people's cause and state property, did not comply with government decrees, and neglected the safety of workers. Therefore, Qian Zhengrong should be immediately dismissed from his post and handed over to the court for legal punishment. Contractor Cui Qichang and Yin Diankui exploited workers and cut corners, causing the tragedy, and should be sent to the court for legal processing. Cui Yancai, director of the Materials Department, the direct superior leader of the brick factory, was careless in his work, lacked policy thinking and a sense of responsibility, improperly appointed cadres, and adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the construction of the factory, failing to inspect, help, and being negligent. He should be severely punished administratively.
    Li Gongxia,兼 general manager, and Zhong Sen, manager, and Zhang Ruoping, supervisor, of Yongmao Construction Company, lacked inspection and did not provide sufficient leadership and education for cadres. They have already requested punishment from the municipal government. The meeting believes that Li Gongxia and others should learn a painful lesson from this incident, convene a general meeting to educate cadres, and conduct a comprehensive safety inspection. Prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The Materials Department brick factory did not comply with the procedures stipulated by the Construction Bureau and should be fined in accordance with the regulations.
    The Municipal Construction Bureau had inspected and stopped this project beforehand, and this responsible spirit should be commended.
    The meeting also unanimously agreed to transfer the entire case to the Beijing Municipal People's Supervision Committee for handling.
    [Another dispatch] According to the instructions of the Municipal People's Government, the Beijing Municipal People's Supervision Committee, in order to earnestly investigate and handle the unfortunate incident of the collapse of a house at the brick and tile factory in the northern suburbs of the Materials Department of the Beijing Public Yongmao Construction Company, which resulted in worker casualties, invited the Municipal People's Procuratorate, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal People's Court, the Municipal Construction Bureau, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Yongmao Company and other units to hold a symposium on the afternoon of the 14th. The Central Supervision Committee also sent a representative to attend and provide guidance. Zhang Ruoping, supervisor of Yongmao Company, reported at the meeting the causes of the incident and the aftermath of the injured and deceased workers. Participants expressed their opinions on the responsibility for the accident and how to deal with it, and also supplemented a lot of materials on the causes and course of the incident. Finally, the meeting decided that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Construction Bureau, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yongmao Company and other units will make written reports on the materials and opinions provided at the meeting, which will be sorted out by the Municipal People's Supervision Committee and continue to be investigated, and make preliminary and comprehensive handling opinions.

　　京市人民政府及监察委员会        
    处理瓦窑厂坍房事件
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市永茂建筑公司材料部北郊砖瓦窑厂，晾瓦棚倒坍砸死砸伤工人事件发生后，中共北京市委员会、北京市人民政府立刻派人到现场调查，慰问受伤工人；同时责成有关机关办理善后，并追究肇事责任。市总工会、市建设局、市劳动局、市人民法院、市公安局北郊分局等有关单位，也都派人到现场调查。该厂已将受伤工人急送医院救治。死者经北京市人民法院验尸后，由公司负责装殓埋葬。关于抚恤问题，该公司已与北京市劳动局商妥，按劳动保险条例规定，依死者六个月薪资发给家属。
    六月五日及七日，北京市人民政府秘书长薛子正连续召集各有关单位开会，研究事件发生的原因及肇事责任，并提出初步处理意见。大家在会上一致指出：这次事件发生在市属公营企业中，它的性质是很严重的。事件发生的原因，主要是该厂负责人钱正荣对人民事业、国家财产不负责任，不遵守政府法令，忽视工人的安全。因此，钱正荣应即撤职，交法院依法判处。包工头崔其昌、尹殿魁，剥削工人，偷工减料，致造成惨剧，应送交法院依法处理。砖厂直接领导上级材料部主任崔彦彩工作粗枝大叶，缺乏政策思想和责任心，对干部任用不当，对建厂工作采取官僚主义态度，不检查、不帮助、麻痹大意，应由行政方面从重处罚。
    永茂建筑公司兼总经理李公侠、经理钟森、监理张若平，缺乏检查，对于干部领导教育不够，他们已向市政府自请处分。会议认为李公侠等应接受这次事件的惨痛教训，召开全体会议，教育干部，进行全面安全检查。杜绝此类事件的再发生。材料部砖厂不遵守建设局规定手续，应照章罚款。
    市建设局对这个工程，事先即曾检查制止，这种负责精神应予以表扬。
    会议并一致同意将全案转送北京市人民监察委员会处理。
    【又讯】北京市人民政府监察委员会根据市人民政府的指示，为了切实调查和处理北京市公营永茂建筑公司材料部北郊砖瓦窑厂倒塌房屋伤亡工人的不幸事件，于十四日下午邀请市人民检察署、市总工会、市人民法院、市建设局、市劳动局、市公安局和永茂公司等单位举行座谈会。中央监察委员会也派了代表一人出席指导。永茂公司监理张若平在会上报告了事件发生的原因及伤亡工人的善后处理经过。与会者对此一事件的肇事责任及如何处理均发表了意见，并对事件发生的原因和经过也补充了许多材料。最后会上决定由市总工会、市建设局、市劳动局、市公安局、永茂公司等单位将会上所提供的材料和意见作出书面报告，交由市人民监察委员会整理并继续加以调查，作出初步的全面的处理意见，再邀请有关各单位开会研究，然后，报请市人民政府批准，并决定对此事件的最后处理办法。
