　　Henan Province Organizes Backward Transportation Tools to Supplement the Shortage of Modernized Transportation Tools

　　Since last autumn, Henan Province has organized more than 10,000 ox carts, handcarts, sailboats and other backward transportation tools to participate in planned transportation, greatly supplementing the shortage of modernized transportation tools. These carts and boats transported a large amount of grain, cotton, tobacco leaves, native products, salt and various materials needed for the Huai River project, supplying the needs of urban and rural people's lives and production and construction. Among them, rubber-tired horse-drawn carts alone transported more than 150,000 tons of goods in the three months of last winter, equivalent to three-quarters of the total annual transportation volume of public and private cars in the province. During the same period, sailboats on the Huai River, Sha River, and Hong River transported more than 220,000 tons of goods.

　　These transportation tools were organized under the leadership of the provincial transportation department. After being organized, the freight volume of the carts and boats increased and the expenses decreased, so they all obtained a lot of profit. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Industrial and Commercial Circles Practice the Patriotic Pact; Northwest Region's Urban Tax Revenue Enters the Treasury on Schedule

　　The Northwest Region's urban tax revenue in the first quarter completed more than 125% of the original budget, and in April it completed 248%. The reason for the increase in tax revenue in the Northwest Region is that, in addition to the increasing prosperity of industry and commerce and the improvement of taxation work, the practice of the patriotic pact by the industrial and commercial circles is an important factor. Industrial and commercial circles in large and medium-sized cities such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Xining, Yinchuan, Baoji, and Tianshui, have launched a widespread "early payment and honest reporting" competition based on the patriotic pact and implemented collective tax payment. These cities have eliminated the phenomenon of late payment, and all industrial and commercial taxes have entered the treasury on schedule. Some cities' industrial and commercial circles have automatically assisted tax authorities in exposing tax evasion households. (Xinhua News Agency)

            河南省组织落后运输工具弥补现代化运输工具的不足
    河南省从去年秋季以来已组织了万余牛马车、人力板车、帆船等落后运输工具参加有计划的运输，大大弥补了现代化运输工具的不足。这些车船运输了大量的粮食、棉花、烟叶、土产、食盐和治淮工程中所需的各种器材，供应了城乡人民生活的需要和生产建设的需要。其中仅胶轮马车去年冬季三个月里就运出了货物十五万余吨，相等于该省公私营汽车全年运输总量的四分之三。同时期，淮河、沙河、洪河的帆船运出的货物也达二十二万余吨。
    这些运输工具是在省交通运输部门的领导下组织起来的。组织起来以后，车船的货运增加，开支减少，所以都获得了很多利润。（新华社）
            工商界实践爱国公约  西北区城市税收按期入库
    西北区城市税收第一季度完成原预算的百分之一百二十五强，四月份完成百分之二百四十八。西北区税收所以增加，除了工商业日益繁荣和税务工作的改进外，工商界实践爱国公约是一重要因素。西安、兰州、迪化、西宁、银川、宝鸡、天水等大中城市的工商界，曾依据爱国公约普遍展开“早缴实报”竞赛，实行集体纳税。这些城市已消灭了滞纳现象，工商业税都全部按期入库。有些城市的工商界自动协助税务机关揭发偷漏户。（新华社）
