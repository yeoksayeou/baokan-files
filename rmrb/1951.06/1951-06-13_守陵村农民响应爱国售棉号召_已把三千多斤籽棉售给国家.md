　　Farmers in Shuling Village Respond to Patriotic Cotton Sales Call

　　Have Already Sold More Than 3,000 Jin of Seed Cotton to the State

Comrade Editor:

　　We, in Shuling Village, Mancheng County, Hebei, every household plants cotton. The People's Government has helped us solve difficulties in cotton planting such as seeds and fertilizers, and has helped us improve cotton planting techniques. Therefore, our cotton harvest increases year by year. Every cotton farmer has not forgotten that these are the benefits that our country and our government have brought us.

　　When we saw the news in the newspaper that the People's Government called on cotton farmers to sell cotton to the state, we held a village-wide parents' symposium on the same day, attended by more than 260 farmers. Many people said, "When eating rice, don't forget the rice grower." We must love our country, and we must resolutely respond to the government's call. Labor model Mi Qinghai said, "If we keep the cotton without selling it, the spinning mill will have to stop working, and the worker brothers will have no work to do, and we will not be able to buy industrial products. How can production continue?" Farmer Mi Cangfeng said, "Let's quickly put the cotton together and sell it to the state. We must strive to be a model of patriotic cotton sales." He also stated that he had 200 jin of cotton and could sell it to the state immediately.

　　After the meeting, all cotton-storing households held family meetings to discuss the sale of cotton. Farmer Mi Lokai discussed with his wife and sold all 200 jin of seed cotton. Mi Lokai also advised his brother Mi Lorong to sell 100 jin. Wang Liu understood the principle that selling cotton is patriotic and prepared to sell all 270 jin of seed cotton, which had been stored for two years, to the state's cotton collection station. The Communist Party members in the village took the lead. Sun Locai was the first to sell 200 jin of seed cotton to the state, and Sun Fuhai also sold 100 jin of seed cotton. A few farmers did not understand the principle that selling cotton is patriotic, so Communist Party members patiently explained it to them. Party member Mi Wenming mobilized Mi Yang'er and other eight households to sell 790 jin of cotton.

　　After three or four days of preparation, 47 farmers in Shuling Village have sold more than 3,700 jin of cotton to the state.

　　守陵村农民响应爱国售棉号召        
    已把三千多斤籽棉售给国家编辑同志：
    我们河北满城县守陵村，家家户户都种了棉花。人民政府帮助我们解决种棉中籽种、肥料等困难，并帮助我们提高种棉技术。因此，我们的棉花收成一年比一年增加。我们每一个种棉户都没有忘记这是我们的国家、我们的政府带给我们的好处。
    我们在报上看到人民政府号召棉农把棉花卖给国家的消息，当天就开了全村家长座谈会，到会二百六十多个农民。好多人都说，“吃米不忘种谷人”，我们要爱国，我们一定要坚决响应政府的号召。劳动模范米清海说：“咱们若存着棉花不卖，纱厂就要停工，工人弟兄没活做，咱们就买不到工业品了，生产还搞得下去吗？”农民米苍峰说：“咱们赶快把棉花凑在一起，卖给国家，我们要争取做个爱国卖棉的模范。”他并首先声明，他有二百斤棉花，立刻就可卖给国家。
    会后，全村存棉户都开家庭会，商量卖棉的事。农民米洛开和老婆商量好，把二百斤籽棉都卖了。米洛开并劝他的弟弟米洛荣也卖了一百斤。王刘氏懂得了卖棉是爱国的道理，准备把存了二年的二百七十斤籽棉，都卖给国家的收花站。村里的共产党员们起了带头作用，孙洛才头一个把二百斤籽棉卖给国家，孙甫海也把一百斤籽棉卖了。少数农民还不明白售棉是爱国的道理，共产党员就去耐心的向他们解释。党员米文明动员米羊尔等八户售棉花七百九十斤。
    经过三、四天的酝酿准备，守陵村已有四十七户农民，把三千七百多斤棉花售给国家了。
