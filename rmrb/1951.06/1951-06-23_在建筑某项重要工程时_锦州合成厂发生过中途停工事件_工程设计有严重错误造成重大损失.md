　　During the Construction of an Important Project:
    Jinzhou Synthetic Factory Experienced a Mid-Construction Stoppage
    Serious Errors in Engineering Design Caused Significant Losses
    No Construction is Possible Without a Correct Engineering Design!
    When the Jinzhou Synthetic Factory in Northeast China was building a new workshop, a major incident of mid-construction stoppage occurred due to the engineering design not being based on reality. The factory began planning in December 1949. In order to complete the task quickly, it merely pieced together existing materials from the German design company during the Japanese puppet regime, and then submitted a construction plan and budget. In March 1950, it formally began designing the mechanical part of the workshop. In April, it began the civil engineering design, and in May, civil engineering construction began. However, due to the discovery of serious errors in the design, the factory's leading body ordered the factory to stop the civil engineering work. The manufacture of mechanical equipment also stopped shortly after the civil engineering construction was halted. As a result, it caused a huge loss of state assets.

    Why did a certain workshop in the Jinzhou Synthetic Factory in Northeast China experience a mid-construction stoppage? The main reason was that three major errors occurred in the design work. The first error was that the mechanical equipment design was based solely on materials from the German design company during the Japanese puppet regime, without first conducting laboratory experiments and temporary equipment experiments in medium-sized workshops. Only after obtaining practical experience should mechanical design and plant design be carried out, and these designs should be approved by higher authorities before construction and manufacturing. The second error was in the engineering design procedure. It was completely wrong to carry out civil engineering design and construction before the mechanical design was completed. In May 1950, the factory's mechanical design was only 80% complete, while civil engineering construction had already begun, which was a case of putting the cart before the horse. Because this design separated the design of the plant and mechanical equipment instead of treating them as a whole. The third was that many inconsistencies occurred in the engineering design. The capacity of the mechanical design was 0.8 tons, but the capacity of the building design was 1.5 tons, almost double. This kind of mismatch in engineering design is the bad result of chaotic engineering design. Because no experiments were done in advance and no practical experience was obtained, it was impossible to calculate scientifically, so the safety factor had to be increased without limitation, resulting in a great waste of equipment capacity.

    It was correct for the factory's leading body to propose a suspension of work as soon as it discovered the design errors in this construction project. However, if the leading body had conducted research and raised questions in a timely manner when approving the plan, it could have prevented the new construction project of Jinzhou Synthetic Factory from starting blindly, or at least stopped work earlier, so that the state investment would not be lost or would suffer less loss.

### 在建筑某项重要工程时  锦州合成厂发生过中途停工事件  工程设计有严重错误造成重大损失

　　在建筑某项重要工程时
    锦州合成厂发生过中途停工事件
    工程设计有严重错误造成重大损失
    没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工！
    东北锦州合成厂新建某工场时，由于工程设计未从实际出发，造成工程中途停工的重大事件。该厂在一九四九年十二月开始做计划，为了赶紧完成任务，仅仅根据厂存伪满时代的德国设计公司的资料，临时拼凑，即提出建筑计划和预算。一九五○年三月正式开始从事该工场机械部分的设计。四月开始土木建筑工程设计，五月土木建筑开工，但因发现设计有严重错误，该厂领导机关即令该场停止土木工程。机械设备的制造，也在土木建筑停工后不久，停止制造。因此，造成国家资财的巨大损失。
    东北锦州合成厂某工场为什么会中途停工呢？主要是在设计工作上产生了三个重要的错误。第一个错误是，机械设备设计仅凭伪满时德国设计公司的资料来设计，没有先经实验室实验，及中型工场临时设备的实验，在取得实际经验后，再作机械设计和厂房设计，并把这些设计经过上级批准后，再进行施工与制造。第二个错误，是工程设计程序上的错误。在机械设计未完成以前，即先进行土木建筑的设计与施工，是完全错误的。在一九五○年五月，该场机械设计仅完成了百分之八十，而土木建筑工程已开始动工，这是本末倒置的举动。因为这种设计把厂房和机械设备的设计分开，而不是一个整体。第三是工程设计发生了很多不配合的现象。机械设计的容量为零点八吨，可是房屋设计的容量为一点五吨，几乎多出了一倍。这种工程设计上的互不配合，就是混乱的工程设计所造成的恶果。因为事先没有做试验，没有取得实际的经验，因此，也就不能科学计算，只好毫无限制地加大安全系数，造成设备容量上的很大浪费。
    该厂领导机关发现此项修建工程设计错误之后，即时提出停工措施，这是正确的。但该领导机关如果在批准计划时，及时进行研究，提出问题，当然还可以使锦州合成厂新建工程不致盲目开工，至少能早一点停工，这样可以使国家投资不受或少受损失。
