　　People's Railway Attendants and Guards
　　Love Revolutionary Army Dependents

　　To the Editor:
　　We are writing to tell you about a model deed of the attendants and guards of the People's Railway in cherishing and helping revolutionary army dependents.

　　Revolutionary army dependent Cai Yuqing, with her child, came from Xinyang, Henan, to visit her husband, Comrade Tong Qingxi, in the army. Because of financial difficulties, she brought very little travel expenses. She explained her difficulties to the comrades of the Second Train Crew Group of the Wuhan Jiang'an Train Section and the comrades of the People's Railway Guard. Chen Liansheng, Cai Dalun, Zhao Zhijiang, Che Weide, Fang Rongbai and other comrades immediately donated 127,000 yuan to help the mother and child buy tickets, and gave the remaining 46,800 yuan to Cai Yuqing as travel expenses.

　　Cai Yuqing suddenly fell ill on the train. The comrades of the train crew group quickly carried her from the hard seat car to the soft seat car to rest. After Cai Yuqing fell ill, she became mentally disturbed, restless, and bumped randomly into the car windows and chairs. The comrades of the train crew group, fearing that she might be in danger, sent a People's Railway police comrade and a train attendant comrade to take care of her specifically. Because there were no doctors or medicines on the train, the comrades of the train crew group called the Anyang Station from Tangyin Station to prepare medicines. Cai Yuqing took the medicine at Anyang Station, and her condition improved. However, the working comrades in the car were still not at ease, fearing that her old illness would recur, and planned to negotiate with the stationmaster at Gaoyi Station to let her stay in the hospital. At that time, because Cai Yuqing was eager to see her husband, she was unwilling to stay, so she did not stay in the hospital.

　　Cai Yuqing and her child arrived safely at our unit with the help of the train personnel and found her husband. She told everyone about the enthusiastic help she received from the attendants and guards of the People's Railway, and took out a letter of comfort given to her by the working comrades of the train when she got off the train. This letter is full of the great proletarian friendship and warm care for the revolutionary army dependents. Every comrade of ours, especially her husband, deeply felt that only in the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao could such moving examples appear today. Now, in addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude for their concern and care, we are willing to repay them with practical actions of intensifying study, working hard, and defending our homes and our country in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea.

### 人民铁路乘务和警卫人员热爱革命军人家属

　　人民铁路乘务和警卫人员        
    热爱革命军人家属编辑同志：
    我们告诉你们一件人民铁路的乘务员和警卫员爱护和帮助革命军人家属的模范事迹。
    革命军人家属蔡玉清带着孩子，由河南信阳来部队看她的丈夫仝庆玺同志。她因经济困难，带的路费很少。她向武汉江岸列车段第二包乘组的同志及人民铁路警卫队的同志说明了自己的困难。陈连生、蔡达伦、赵志江、车维德、方荣柏诸同志当场捐助了十二万七千元，帮她们母子买了车票，并且将剩下的四万六千八百元，给蔡玉清作路费。
    蔡玉清在车上突然得了病。包乘组的同志们赶紧由硬席车上把她背到软席车上休息。蔡玉清得病后神经错乱，坐卧不安，在车窗和椅子上胡乱撞碰。包乘组的同志怕她发生危险，又派了一位人民铁路警察同志和一位列车员同志专门看护她。因为车上没有医生和药品，包乘组的同志在汤阴车站打电话给安阳车站，准备医药。蔡玉清在安阳车站吃了药，病就减轻了。但车里的工作同志们仍然不放心，怕她旧病复发，打算在高邑车站和站长交涉，让她住医院。当时因为蔡玉清急着想见丈夫，不愿留下，才没有住院。
    蔡玉清和她的小孩，就这样在该列车人员的帮助下，平安地到达了我们的部队，找到了自己的丈夫。她把人民铁路的乘务人员和警卫人员对她的热情帮助向大家谈了，并拿出该列车工作同志在她下车时给她的一封安慰信。在这封信里，充满了伟大的工人阶级的友爱和对革命军人家属的热烈关怀。我们每个同志，——尤其是她的丈夫，深深感到只有在毛主席领导下的新中国，才会有象今天这样令人感动的事例出现。现在我们部队同志除了对他们的关怀和照顾表示衷心的感激外，并愿在抗美援朝的运动中，以加紧学习、努力工作、保家卫国的实际行动来答谢他们。
