　　Henan Xuchang Prefecture's Eight Cities and Counties
    Launch Campaign to Donate Eight Airplanes
    [Our Newspaper] The people of Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, are enthusiastically carrying out a campaign to donate weapons. As of the 13th, eight cities and counties, including Xuchang City, Luohe City, Yu County, Baofeng, Xiangcheng County, Linying, Ye County, and Yancheng, have each launched a campaign to donate a fighter plane named after their respective city or county. In addition, Xiangcheng County will donate an "Xiangcheng County" anti-aircraft gun. The Resist-America Aid-Korea branches of the above cities and counties have all held meetings to discuss the call of the Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association. Representatives from all walks of life have put forward donation amounts based on the people's increased production. Some units have already drawn up donation plans. The Luohe City transportation industry has set a plan to donate five days' profit each month, totaling 30 million, from June to the end of the year. They have also challenged people from all walks of life. At the Xuchang City People's Resist-America Aid-Korea Representative Conference, all sectors pledged to donate 1.73 billion yuan. Workers in the city proposed to work an extra Sunday and strive to win awards in labor competitions to donate their bonuses. Farmers in all counties proposed to "increase production by 10%" and donate from the increased production. Yu County labor model Ma Xinrang, Lushan special-class labor model Su Dianxuan, and 1,565 mutual aid groups in Lushan County (accounting for one-third of the total number of mutual aid groups in the county) have all formulated plans to increase production and donate, and have challenged each other to guarantee implementation.
