    Comrade Zhang Jingxi, Model Telephone Operator of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    (1) Comrade Zhang Jingxi is a telephone operator of a certain telephone company of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, an outstanding Communist Party member, who is active in his work during peacetime and resolute and brave in wartime.
    (2) During the annihilation battle at Hengcheng on the Han River front on February 14th, the American invading army, surrounded by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, concentrated all its artillery fire on the small mountain gully of Jipyeong-ri, attempting to open a gap and break through to escape. The shells set fire to the surrounding forests. Two telephone lines connecting the headquarters of a certain unit to the forward positions were blown into several sections by the enemy. Comrade Zhang Jingxi accepted the arduous task of checking and connecting these telephone lines.
    (3) Comrade Zhang Jingxi crawled forward under enemy fire, forgetting fatigue and hunger, although the enemy's artillery fire had knocked him unconscious several times. But he still tenaciously searched for the two broken ends of the telephone line in the fire, connecting them together.
    (4) His bravery and resourcefulness consistently ensured communication between the headquarters and the forward positions, enabling the leaders of the unit to issue orders smoothly, launch a counterattack against the enemy, and win the victory of the Hengcheng annihilation battle.
    Comrade Zhang Jingxi's heroic deeds have won the praise of his comrades. At the celebration meeting, he was awarded two major merits and four minor merits, and was given the glorious title of "Model Telephone Operator."

    中国人民志愿军模范电话员张景喜同志
    （一）张景喜同志是中国人民志愿军某部电话连的电话员，一个优秀的共产党员，平时工作积极，战时坚决勇敢。
    （二）在二月十四日汉江前线横城的歼灭战中，陷入中国人民志愿军重围的美国侵略军集中了所有的炮火向砥平里这个小山沟轰击，企图从此打开缺口突围逃窜。炮弹把四周的树林都打着火了。某部指挥所通往前沿阵地的两条电话线，前后被敌人炸成了几段。张景喜同志接受了查接这段电话线的艰巨任务。
   （三）张景喜同志在敌人的炮火下匍匐前进，忘却了疲劳和饥饿，虽然敌人的炮火曾使他昏过去了几次。但是他仍然不屈不挠地在火堆中找寻电话线的两个断头，使它连接起来。
    （四）他的勇敢和机智，始终保证了指挥部与前沿阵地的通话，使得某部首长能够很顺利地下达命令，向敌人展开反击，赢得了横城歼灭战的胜利。
    张景喜同志的英雄事迹，获得了同志们的称赞，在庆功会上给他记了两次大功，四次小功，并赠给他“模范电话员”的光荣称号。
