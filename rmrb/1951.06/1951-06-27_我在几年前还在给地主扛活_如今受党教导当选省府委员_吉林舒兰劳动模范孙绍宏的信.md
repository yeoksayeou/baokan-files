To the Beloved Chairman Mao:

The thirtieth anniversary of our Party is approaching, and it reminds me of the painful life of oppression and exploitation I endured in the past. Before, working for landlords, year after year, I could never make ends meet. I couldn't afford food or clothing, and every year I fell deeper into debt. The landlord even called me a "poor wretch," treating poor people worse than cattle. After August 15th, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued us, the vast laboring people who were oppressed, from the fire pit, leading us to overthrow feudalism, implement land reform, and become masters of our own destiny, living a good life, no longer suffering the cruel life of being ruled.

After liberation, I received one hectare and eight mu of fertile land, two and a half rooms of large tile-roofed house, and a large yellow ox, laying the foundation for production. Thanks to the Party's correct leadership and education, pointing out to us the clear direction of organizing to develop production, our production gradually improved, and our lives steadily improved. We lived comfortably, had surplus food every year, and wore new clothes every year, making two sets of single clothes and one set of cotton clothes, and even wearing a large fur coat in winter. Under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, I gloriously joined the Communist Party, was elected as a provincial and county labor model, and was also elected as a member of the Provincial People's Government. My political consciousness has been raised, and my education is also stronger than before. Now I can understand the Jilin Daily, and I am no longer illiterate. Not only me, not only our whole team, but also the political, cultural, and economic lives of the working people in our whole village, township, district, county, and province have been improved. "I can't forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for what I have today!" These kinds of words are often heard here.

We have popularized patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea current affairs education, responded to the government's call to launch a patriotic bumper harvest competition, and after democratic discussion, formulated a practical bumper harvest competition plan. At the same time, we proposed to challenge Li Shunda's team in Shanxi Province and issued a friendly challenge to mutual aid teams in the whole county, launching mutual competition between households and individuals within the team, which aroused the production enthusiasm of all team members. Therefore, we finished the spring plowing five days ahead of schedule and paid attention to improving agricultural production technology, planting more industrial raw materials and commercial grain, and expanding the fertilizer application area. We used new-style horse-drawn farm implements to expand 13 hectares of cultivated land, plus 22 hectares of wasteland reclaimed last year, totaling 35 hectares. In order to further develop the summer hoeing bumper harvest competition, at the end of the spring plowing, we conducted a spring plowing evaluation within the team and the village, and selected different models of households, individuals, and teams. Our team was gloriously selected as the model team for the spring plowing stage of the bumper harvest competition in the whole county. Following the enthusiasm of the spring plowing evaluation, we formulated a summer hoeing bumper harvest competition plan. In order to complete the team's plan, on June 15th, more than thirty male and female team members used new and old farm implements to start the summer hoeing in earnest. We worked closely, plowing and harrowing as much as possible. All team members have the confidence to do a good job in this year's production. We are raising our vigilance and will mobilize the masses to denounce, report, and secretly inform on counter-revolutionary elements, eliminate harm for the people, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

Our team responded to the call of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association regarding: promoting patriotic covenants, donating airplanes and cannons, and doing a good job in preferential treatment. Our entire team of thirty-four households is currently discussing this donation work. I myself voluntarily offered 300,000 yuan to supply the purchase of airplanes and cannons, support the Korean War, increase the fighting power on the front line, and strive to defeat the aggression of American imperialism as soon as possible. We use this practical action to welcome "July 1st" and congratulate the great glorious achievement of the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party.

Respectfully wish the Communist Party of China long life! May Chairman Mao be in good health!

　　我在几年前还在给地主扛活  如今受党教导当选省府委员
    ——吉林舒兰劳动模范孙绍宏的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我党三十周年的生日快到了，使我不能忘掉从前被压迫被剥削的痛苦生活。过去，给地主扛活，一年一年的劳动，总是手够不着脚，脚够不着手，吃不上，穿不上，一年一个光，年年拉亏空。地主还叫我“穷种”，把穷人看的连牛马都不赶（如）。“八一五”后，共产党和毛主席把我们受压迫的广大劳动人民，从火坑里救出来，领导我们斗倒了封建，实行了土地改革，使我们翻身作了主人，过好日子，不再过那被统治的惨酷生活了。
    解放后，我分得了一垧八亩的油黑土地，两间半大瓦房，一头大黄辕马，打下了生产基础。由于党正确地领导和教育我们，指给我们组织起来发展生产的明确方向，使我们生产逐步提高，生活一个劲地上升。住的安适了，吃的年年有余，穿的，每年都是新做两套单衣，一套棉衣，冬天还穿上了大皮袄。我在共产党的教育培养下，光荣的参加了共产党，当选了省、县的劳动模范，还被选为省人民政府委员。政治觉悟提高了，文化也比从前强了。我现在能看懂吉林日报，不是以前的瞪眼瞎了。不光我，也不光我们全组，就是我们全屯、全村、全区、全县、全省的劳动人民的政治、文化、经济生活也都提高了。“我能有今天，可不能忘掉共产党和毛主席！”像这样的话，在我们这里是常常听到的。
    我们这里普及了抗美援朝时事教育，响应了政府开展爱国主义丰产竞赛的号召，经过民主讨论作出了切合实际的丰产竞赛计划，同时提出向山西省李顺达组提出应战并向全县互助组提出友谊挑战，在组内开展了户与户，人与人互相竞赛，激起了全体组员的生产积极性。因此，提前五天结束了春耕，并注意了提高农业生产技术，多种了工业原料与商品粮，扩大了施肥面积。用新式马拉农具扩大了十三垧耕地，加上去年开荒二十二垧计三十五垧。为了更进一步开展好夏锄丰产竞赛，当春耕结束时，在组内，屯内进行了春耕评比，选出了户、人、组等不同的模范，我组光荣的被选为全县春耕阶段丰产竞赛模范组。接着春耕评比的热劲，订出了夏锄丰产竞赛计划。为了完成全组计划，于六月十五日，全组三十多名男女组员使用着新旧农具紧张地开始了夏锄。做到紧铲紧趟，多铲多趟。全体组员都有信心把今年的生产搞好。我们提高警惕性，并要发动群众控诉、检举、密告反革命分子，为民除害，巩固人民民主专政。
    我们组响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的关于：推行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮和做好优抚工作的号召。我们全组三十四户现正在讨论捐献这一工作。我自己首先自愿拿出人民币三十万元，供给买飞机大炮，支援朝鲜战争，增加前线战斗力量，争取早日打败美帝国主义的侵略。以此实际行动来迎接“七一”，并祝贺我党成立三十周年的伟大光辉成就。
    敬祝中国共产党万岁！毛主席身体健康！
