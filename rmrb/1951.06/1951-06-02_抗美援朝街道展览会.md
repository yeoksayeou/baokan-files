The "Anti-American and Aid-Korea Street Exhibition" recently held by the industrial and commercial circles of Shimen No. 1 Road in Shanghai is a new method of conducting patriotic propaganda to the broad masses. It is not only more concentrated, planned, and systematic than general window displays, but also organized and led, so the propaganda effect is also greater. Shimen No. 1 Road, from Nanjing West Road to Weihaiwei Road, has a total of 137 shops, most of which are fashion stores and silk, satin, and department stores. When the Cultural and Educational Section of the district people's government initially proposed the idea of ​​holding a street exhibition to the industrial and commercial circles of this road, some people in the industrial and commercial circles were afraid that it would hinder the business of the shops. However, after several discussions and studying how to combine window exhibits with the display of goods, they dispelled their concerns and unanimously agreed to hold the exhibition. Therefore, a preparatory committee was formed by the industrial and commercial circles, workers, the district Anti-American and Aid-Korea branch, and the district people's government. Subsequently, the industrial and commercial circles voluntarily raised the funds needed for the exhibition, and more than 70 students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts actively helped with the design and layout, drawing various propaganda posters and charts. After more than a month of preparation, the exhibition held a grand opening ceremony on May 4th.

Shimen No. 1 Road has been completely renewed. Two large archways stand at both ends of the street, with large slogans written on them: "Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries and Welcome Red May," "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend World Peace." Sixty flag towers are arranged on the sidewalks, with red flags flying on the towers. The shop windows along the street are decorated very brightly. Among the exhibits in the windows are cartoons and moving models with different content and forms. Some are three-dimensional models of Japanese devils massacring our compatriots during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It evoked painful memories for the audience, who were more actively opposed to the United States arming Japan. Some are vivid pictures of the Chinese People's Volunteers capturing American devils alive. There are also many exhibits that are arranged in conjunction with the business of each store. For example, in the window of the Jinlei Leather Shoe Store, a huge leather shoe forcefully steps on a counter-revolutionary element. In the window of the children's clothing store, various children's clothing are used to decorate the Anti-American and Aid-Korea activities of young pioneers.

This "Anti-American and Aid-Korea Street Exhibition" has been welcomed by the broad masses of Shanghai citizens. In the ten days since its opening, there have been more than 80,000 visitors, the most of whom are housewives who rarely participate in social activities. Due to the enthusiastic audience, the shops have also increased their customers, and business has prospered. Some business owners have also asked students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts to help them design and add exhibits. Many stores on Nanjing Road, the busiest street in Shanghai, have also begun to prepare for this new type of exhibition. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　抗美援朝街道展览会
    杨瑛
    上海市石门一路工商界在最近举办的“抗美援朝街道展览会”，是向广大群众进行爱国主义宣传的一种新方法，它不仅比一般的橱窗宣传较为集中，较有计划、有系统，而且有组织、有领导，所以宣传效果也大。石门一路从南京西路到威海卫路一段共有商店一百三十七家，其中绝大部分是时装店及绸缎、百货等商店。当该区区人民政府文教科最初向这一路的工商界提出试办街道展览会的建议时，曾有若干工商界人士怕因此而妨碍商店的营业。但经过几次讨论，研究了橱窗展览品如何和商品的陈列相结合后，他们打消了顾虑，一致同意举办展览会，于是由工商界、职工及该区抗美援朝支会、区人民政府组成了筹备委员会。接着，工商界自动筹集了展览会所需的经费，由上海美术专科学校七十多位同学积极帮助设计和布置，绘制各种宣传画及图表。经一个多月筹备，展览会于五月四日举行了隆重的开幕典礼。
    石门一路已经是焕然一新，街道两端矗立着两个大牌楼，上面写着镇压反革命、迎接红五月，抗美援朝、保卫世界和平的大字标语，人行道上排列着六十座旗塔，塔上红旗飘扬，沿街橱窗都布置得十分鲜丽。入夜，街市灯火辉煌。在橱窗的展览品中，有着不同内容和形式的漫画及活动模型。有的是抗日战争中日本鬼子屠杀我国同胞的立体模型。它唤起了观众们惨痛的回忆，更积极地去反对美国武装日本；有的是中国人民志愿军活捉美国鬼子的生动画面。还有许多展览品是结合着各商店的业务来布置的，例如金蕾皮鞋店的橱窗里，用一只巨大的皮鞋，有力地踩在一个反革命分子的身上。童装店的橱窗里，用各式童装布置着少年儿童队员的抗美援朝活动。
    这个“抗美援朝街道展览会”，受到上海广大市民的欢迎。开幕十天来，观众已有八万人以上，其中最多的是平时很少参加社会活动的家庭妇女。由于观众踊跃，商店也增多了顾客，生意也随之兴隆。有些商居老板们还要求上海美术专科学校同学帮助他们设计增加展览品。上海最热闹的南京路，有许多商店也已开始筹办这种新型的展览会。（新华社）
