　　Beijing is Striving to Complete Housing Repairs
       Xue Zizheng
    Beijing's houses have fallen into disrepair due to years of neglect. Every rainy season, houses leak and collapse, posing a great threat to the working people. In addition, the large increase in population after liberation has led to an insufficient allocation of housing, resulting in a rather serious housing shortage. For more than two years, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has been working hard to change this situation. In the early days of liberation, the Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on housing issues, announcing the policy of protecting urban housing to the citizens, and vigorously adjusted some excessively low rents, which initially clarified the chaotic leasing relationship that had formed over the years. In the second half of last year, housing repair committees were established in various districts, and more than 10,000 houses were repaired. In February of this year, at the first session of the Third Municipal People's Congress, Mayor Peng Zhen called on all citizens to unite and help each other, and work together, both public and private, to build houses and gradually solve the housing shortage. We have strived to adopt a series of measures to basically overcome the serious housing shortage that existed before. It is undeniable that the effective way to fundamentally solve the housing problem is to build a large number of new houses. This is the work that the People's Government and the broad masses of citizens are currently carrying out and will continue to work hard on in the future. However, the plan for large-scale construction of houses cannot be fully realized in the short term. Therefore, we must first vigorously protect and repair the existing houses in a timely manner, and strive to prevent leaks and collapses, or at least reduce them. If we continue to do so, we have sufficient confidence and certainty to gradually overcome or alleviate the housing difficulties.

    As of now, various districts have repaired nearly 50,000 houses, achieving great results. This fully demonstrates the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the people of the capital in overcoming difficulties. Practical experience is valuable in this matter; based on existing experience, our future work also needs to be further improved. That is to say:

    First, making the masses correctly understand the city's housing policy is the basic key to repairing houses well. The People's Government's housing policy and relevant laws should be explained universally, deeply, and repeatedly through the People's Congress and forums for landlords and tenants, combining the immediate interests of both parties, so that everyone clearly recognizes that the ownership of urban houses and the resulting leasing relationship are different from the feudal land ownership relationship. Today's People's Government not only does not abolish legitimate leasing relationships but also protects them. Landlords should understand that since the ownership of the house belongs to the landlord, the responsibility for repairing the house should naturally be borne by the landlord. If the landlord does not carry out repairs, the result will inevitably lead to irreparable loss of personal property. At the same time, tenants should understand that they must pay a relatively reasonable rent to the landlord. If they do not try to adjust low rents as much as possible or assist the landlord in repairing the house in other ways, it is the tenants themselves who are threatened by the safety of their residence. Therefore, in any case, neither party should adopt a passive and delaying attitude.

    Second, it has been proven that housing repair is an arduous process of mobilizing, educating, and organizing the masses. The repair of dilapidated houses requires a great deal of effort. At the same time, in the situation where the landlord-tenant relationship has not yet fully entered the right track, we need to enlighten and explain to them more patiently in order to give play to the wisdom and strength of the masses and mobilize them to act consciously. The districts have formed housing repair committees with enthusiastic citizens (including landlords and tenants) from all strata as the backbone, which is the most powerful organizational form for mobilizing and leading the masses to carry out work.

    Third, when solving the problem of housing repair, the spirit of democratic, equal, voluntary, and mutually beneficial consultation must be thoroughly implemented. Only in this way can we find the right way to solve the problem. Through consultation and the specific assistance of the repair committee, landlords and tenants give play to the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and can jointly complete the repair work.

    Fourth, at present, due to the limitations of the people's affordability and other conditions, it is still impossible to make a comprehensive and completely reasonable adjustment to rents. However, repair costs are a component of reasonable rent. Therefore, with the agreement of both the landlord and the tenant, appropriately raising the rent is one of the important links in promoting repair work. Doing so can achieve the purpose of repairing the house; at the same time, through repairing the house, the leasing relationship is improved and adjusted, making the rights and obligations of both parties clearer, and the landlord's enthusiasm for managing the house can be greatly improved.

    Finally, it also needs to be mentioned that the loan and relief measures taken by the People's Government have also effectively solved the difficulties of some citizens who are indeed unable to repair their houses.

    The rainy season is approaching, and some housing repair work has not yet been completed. With the joint efforts of the People's Government, the repair committees, and the broad masses of the people, we should all take urgent action and strive to successfully complete the housing repair work!

　　北京市正为完成房屋修缮而努力
       薛子正
    北京市的房屋因多年失修，破旧不堪，每年雨季房漏屋塌，对于劳动人民威胁甚大；再加上解放后人口大量增加，房屋不敷分配，造成了相当严重的房荒现象。两年多来，北京市人民政府就一直在努力设法改变这种情况。解放初期，军事管制委员会颁布了房屋问题布告，向市民宣布了保护城市房屋的政策，并大力调整了一部分过低的租金，这样就初步地澄清了多年来形成的混乱的租赁关系。去年下半年，各区又相继成立了房屋修缮委员会，修好了一万余间房屋。今年二月，在本市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议上，彭真市长又号召全体市民团结互助，公私合力，兴建房屋，逐步解决房荒。我们就努力采取了一系列的措施，基本上克服了前此存在的严重房荒现象。不可否认，根本解决房屋困难的有效办法是大批地兴建新的房屋，这是人民政府与广大市民目前正在进行、今后也要继续努力进行的工作。但是，大规模建筑房屋的计划，还不可能在短期内完全实现，因此，我们还必须首先用大力保护并及时修缮现有的房屋，争取不漏不塌或少漏少塌。如果我们这样做下去，我们就有足够的把握和信心逐步战胜或减轻房屋的困难。
    截至目前为止，各区已修房屋约近五万间，获得了很大的成绩。这充分表现出了首都人民团结互助、战胜困难的精神。在这个问题上，实际的经验是宝贵的；根据已有的经验，我们今后的工作也需要更进一步地加以改进。这就是说：
    第一，使群众正确地了解城市房屋政策，乃是修好房屋的基本关键。应该通过各界人民代表会议，并召开房主、房客座谈会，结合双方切身利益，普遍地、深入地反复阐明人民政府的房屋政策与有关的法令，使大家明确地认识到：城市房屋的占有关系及由此所产生的租赁关系，是不同于封建的土地占有关系的。今天的人民政府不但不废除而且还保护正当的租赁关系。要使房主了解房屋所有权既属于房主，房屋修缮的责任当然也应由房主来负担。房主如不进行修缮，其结果必将招致个人财产不可补偿的损失。同时要使房客了解，必须向房主缴纳比较合理的租金，如果不去尽可能调整低租或以其他方式协助房主修房，其结果受到居住安全威胁的不是别人，正是房客自己。因此，无论如何，双方都不应该采取消极拖延的态度。
    第二，事实证明，房屋修缮是一个艰苦地动员、教育群众和组织群众的过程。破旧房屋的修缮，需要费很大的力量。同时，在房主房客的租赁关系尚未完全走入正轨的情况下，要求我们更加耐心地启发、说明他们，才能发挥群众的智慧和力量，动员群众自觉地行动起来。各区将各阶层人民中热心公益的市民（房主房客在内）作为骨干，组成房屋修缮委员会，这是动员与带领群众进行工作最有力的组织形式。
    第三，在解决房屋修缮问题时，必须彻底贯彻民主平等的，自愿两利的协商精神。只有这样才能找出解决问题的正当途径。通过协商与修缮委员会的具体帮助，房主房客发挥了团结互助的精神，便可以共同完成修缮工作。
    第四，目前因为人民负担能力与其他条件的限制，还无法对租金进行全面的完全合理的调整。但修缮费用是合理租金的组成部分。因此，经房主房客双方协议，适当提高租金，是推动修缮工作的重要环节之一。这样做一方面可以达到修房的目的；同时通过修房也就改进与调整了租赁关系，使双方权利、义务更加明确，房主经营房屋的积极性也就可以大大提高了。
    最后，还需要提到的是，人民政府所采取的贷款与救济的措施，也有效地解决了部分市民确实无力修房的困难。
    雨季即将到来，一部分房屋修缮工作还没有完成。在人民政府、修缮委员会和广大人民共同努力之下，我们大家应该紧急地行动起来，为胜利完成房屋修缮工作而努力！
