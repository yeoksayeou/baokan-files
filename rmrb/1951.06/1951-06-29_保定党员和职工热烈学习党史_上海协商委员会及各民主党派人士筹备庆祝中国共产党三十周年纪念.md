　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, June 26th: In order to welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Party organizations in Baoding City have universally launched a movement to study Party history. Party cadres from the Baoding Municipal Party Committee, various bureaus of the Baoding Municipal People's Government, and various people's organizations, as well as all workers and Party members of the Baoding Telecommunications Bureau, the Baoding Flour Mill of the China Economic Construction Corporation, and the Yuanfeng Cigarette Factory, have studied articles such as "Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese Communist Party" and "What Kind of Party is the Chinese Communist Party" published in the "Current Events Manual," and launched discussions. Wang Yanqing, secretary of the Party branch of the Telecommunications Bureau, recalled the heroic deeds of the outstanding Party member Wang Heli during the study. In July 1938, Wang Heli was arrested by Japanese invaders for carrying out the Party's resolution. The Japanese devils and traitors used various tortures on him, but he never revealed any information about the Party. When Wang Heli was martyred, he still shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Wang Yanqing's recollection had a great educational effect on everyone. Party members resolutely stated that they would inherit the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary martyrs and fight to the end for the final realization of a communist society.
　　Workers in various factories have also launched publicity activities. Party organizations of the Yuanfeng Cigarette Factory and the Baoding Flour Mill of the China Economic Construction Corporation have begun to publicize the glorious history of the Chinese Communist Party's arduous struggle in various workshops. Each production team is generally discussing and formulating production plans in conjunction with the current tasks.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th: The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held a meeting on the 25th. According to the joint notice of the central committees of the democratic parties, it discussed the issue of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Representatives of the Shanghai local organizations of the democratic parties and non-party figures such as Su Yanbin, Sheng Pihua, Shen Baowen, and Wang Yunsheng successively expressed their opinions, advocating that the Municipal Consultative Committee should jointly with the Shanghai local organizations of the democratic parties, Shanghai people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures, together with East China people's organizations, hold a grand celebration meeting on July 1st. The local organizations of the democratic parties and the people's organizations are preparing to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the CCP by giving speeches, holding symposiums, broadcasting, writing articles, publishing special issues of periodicals, and publishing special supplements of newspapers to the people they are connected with, and responding to the three major calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association on June 1st.
　　On the morning of the 26th, the Municipal Consultative Committee also invited heads of 26 units from various democratic parties and people's organizations and more than 30 non-party democratic figures to discuss the preparatory work for the celebration meeting.

　　保定党员和职工热烈学习党史
   上海协商委员会及各民主党派人士筹备庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念
    【新华社保定二十六日电】为迎接中国共产党成立三十周年纪念日，保定市党的组织普遍地展开了学习党史运动。中共保定市委会、保定市人民政府各局和各人民团体的党员干部，保定电信局、中国经济建设公司保定面粉厂、源丰烟厂的全体职工和党员，都学习了“时事手册”刊载的“庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年”和“中国共产党是怎样的党”等文章，并展开讨论。电信局中共支部书记王彦庆在学习中回忆优秀党员王鹤立的英雄事迹。王鹤立在一九三八年七月，为执行党的决议，被日寇逮捕。日本鬼子和汉奸曾对他施用各种酷刑，但他始终没有暴露一点有关党的材料。王鹤立在就义时仍高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。王彦庆的回忆对大家起了很大的教育作用。党员们都坚决表示，要继承革命先烈的革命精神，为最后实现共产主义社会而斗争到底。
    各工厂职工们也展开了宣传活动。源丰烟厂、中国经济建设公司保定面粉厂党的组织已开始在各车间宣传中国共产党艰苦斗争的光荣历史。各生产小组结合当前任务正普遍讨论并订立生产计划。
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会常务委员会二十五日举行会议，根据各民主党派中央的联合通知，讨论了庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年纪念的问题。各民主党派上海地方组织代表及无党派人士苏延宾、盛丕华、申葆文、王芸生等委员相继发表意见，主张由市协商委员会联合各民主党派上海地方组织、上海各人民团体及无党派民主人士会同华东各人民团体，于七月一日举行盛大的庆祝大会。各民主党派地方组织及各人民团体准备向自己所联系的人民群众，用演讲、开座谈会、广播、写文章、期刊出专号、报纸出特刊等办法，庆祝中共成立三十周年，并响应抗美援朝总会六月一日的三大号召。
