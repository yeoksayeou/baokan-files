　　Shanxi Yuncheng, Linfen, Yuci and Other Districts
    Cotton Selling and Stockpiling Competition Unfolds
    The patriotic cotton selling and stockpiling campaign is vigorously unfolding in the cotton-producing areas of Yuncheng, Linfen, and Yuci in Shanxi Province. The Yuncheng District held an emergency meeting on the 6th of this month, emphasizing that cotton purchasing and stockpiling is an urgent political task. It also analyzed the conditions for completing the task: first, the vast majority of cotton farmers do indeed have cotton in storage. According to a preliminary survey in Ronghe County in May, cotton farmers have at least one million catties in storage. If each of the more than 500 villages in the entire district has an average of at least 1,000 catties, that would be more than five million catties. Second, after the Resist America, Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, the ideological awareness of the masses has generally improved. As long as the reasons are clearly explained, the price policy is correctly implemented, and the purchase procedures are simplified, cotton farmers are willing to sell or store their cotton with the state. After the meeting, the local Communist Party committees issued instructions, calling on all party members to take urgent action to enthusiastically respond to the state's call and carry out the patriotic cotton selling and stockpiling campaign. The Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the cooperatives have also issued calls to their members to respond to this patriotic movement. District, county, and district-level local cadres and faculty members of secondary schools have all written letters to their families, mobilizing their fathers, brothers, and relatives to sell cotton to the state. The Financial and Economic Committee of the District Commissioner's Office dispatched cadres on the 8th of this month to Yuxiang, Jiexian, Xinjiang, Ronghe, and Hejin counties to conduct key supervision and inspection and create experience. The Linfen District Commissioner's Office also sent five section-chief-level cadres to cotton-producing counties to convey and deploy cotton purchasing and stockpiling work. The Linfen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company held a joint meeting of managers, section chiefs, and team leaders from branch companies and purchasing teams to discuss cotton purchasing and stockpiling work. Representatives from all sectors of the Hongdong County People's Congress discussed this work, and the representatives all expressed their willingness to mobilize the masses to sell cotton to the state. The County Financial and Economic Committee printed more than 500 propaganda materials. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company held two symposiums with private purchasing stores and exchanges, and mobilized cotton farmers to sell or store cotton with the state through the private merchants' relationships in the countryside, which played a significant role. Of the 3,816 catties of cotton stored by the company as of the 7th of this month, 75% was mobilized by private purchasing stores. The county has purchased more than 50,000 catties. After propaganda and mobilization, Liwu Village in Fencheng has sold more than 7,000 catties of cotton. A certain village in Hongdong stored 800 catties of cotton in one day. It seems that as long as the policies are clearly explained to the masses, the reasons are explained, and the activists take the lead, it is not a problem to complete the task. After reading the instructions from the State Council and the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, the Yuci Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company immediately held an emergency meeting on the 6th of this month with the managers and team leaders of the Fenyang, Wenshui, Pingyao, and Taigu branch companies to study and discuss cotton purchasing and stockpiling work, formulate specific practices to complete the task, and challenge the Yuncheng and Linfen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies to strive to purchase all the cotton stored by cotton farmers. Now a group of cadres has been dispatched with cloth and grain receipt slips, combined with supply and marketing cooperatives, to purchase cotton village by village in cotton-producing areas. Some achievements have also been made in mobilizing private cotton shops to sell cotton to the state. The Zhongxingyong and Tongyihe cotton shops in Pingyao sold all 11,900 catties of cotton to the state.

　　山西运城临汾榆次等专区
    售棉存棉竞赛展开
    爱国主义的售棉、储棉竞赛运动，已在山西产棉区运城、临汾、榆次三个专区热烈展开。运城专区于本月六日召开紧急会议，强调购棉储棉是一个紧急的政治任务。并分析了完成任务的条件：一是广大棉农手中确实存有棉花。据荣河县五月份的初步调查，棉农手中最少存有一百多万斤。全专区五百多个村庄，每村最少平均一千斤，就有五百多万斤。二是经过抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动后，群众的思想觉悟普遍提高。只要讲清道理，正确执行价格政策，简化收购手续，棉农是愿拿出存棉出卖或存储给国家的。会后中共地方委员会发出指示，号召全体党员紧急行动起来热烈响应国家号召，开展爱国主义的售棉储棉运动；青年团、妇委会、合作社也都向所属发出响应这一爱国运动的号召。专、县、区级地方干部和中等学校的教职员，都纷纷给家庭写信，动员父兄及其亲友把棉花卖给国家。专署财政经济委员会于本月八日抽调干部，分赴虞乡、解县、新绛、荣河、河津等五县进行重点督促检查，创造经验。临汾专署亦抽出五个科长级干部到产棉县传达并布置购棉、储棉工作。临汾花纱布公司召开了支公司及收购小组的经理、股长、组长联席会议，讨论了购棉储棉工作。洪洞县各界人民代表会上讨论了这个工作，各代表都表示要动员群众把棉花卖给国家；县财政经济委员会印发了五百多份宣传品；花纱布公司召开了两次私人代购店和交易所座谈会，通过私商在农村关系，动员棉农把棉花卖给或储存国家，起了很大作用。该公司截至本月七日止存入的三千八百一十六斤棉花中，私商代购店动员存入的占百分之七十五强。全县已收购五万余斤。经过宣传动员，汾城李吴村已卖出棉花七千余斤。洪洞某村一天内存棉花八百斤。看来只要给群众讲清政策，说明道理，通过积极分子带头，完成任务是不成问题的。榆次花纱布分公司在看了政务院及省财政经济委员会的指示后，即于本月六日召开了汾阳、文水、平遥、太谷支公司经理和组长紧急会议，研究讨论了购棉储棉工作，订出了完成任务的具体做法，并向运城、临汾花纱布公司提出挑战，争取做到把棉农手中的存棉全部购买出来。现在已抽调一批干部带着布匹和粮食收据单，与供销社结合到产棉区挨村收购。在动员私人花店把棉花卖给国家上也做出一些成绩。平遥中兴永、同义合两花店，把一万一千九百斤棉花全数卖给了国家。
