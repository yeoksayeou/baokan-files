　　Hoping Engraver Brothers Donate Wages to Purchase Airplanes and Cannons to Support the Korean Front
　　——Letter from Shi Changming, a Miao Engraver in Hunan

　　Dear Chairman Mao:
　　I am a Miao person and have been deaf for more than ten years. I am twenty-seven years old this year. In order to drive away the American devils as soon as possible and to enjoy peace forever, in addition to working hard to respond to the call to donate airplanes and cannons, I suggest that all engraver brothers across the country donate their wages around "July 1st" to purchase airplanes or cannons to support the victory struggle of the Volunteer Army.

　　Salute!
　　Shi Changming, Engraver at Suoli, Hunan

　　希望刻字工人弟兄捐献工资  购买飞机大炮支援朝鲜前线
    ——湖南苗族刻字工人石昌明的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我是苗族人，耳朵聋了十几年了，今年二十七岁。为了早打走美国鬼子，为了永远享受太平，我除了自己努力响应捐献飞机大炮的号召外，建议全国刻字工人弟兄们都在“七一”前后捐献工资购买飞机或大炮支援志愿军的胜利斗争。敬礼！
