　　The Determined and Tenacious Chinese and Korean Engineers
　　Li Qinglie Xu Ping
    On the Korean front, the engineers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army overcame the enemy's air and artillery harassment, overcame various difficulties, and worked intensively to repair bridges, build roads, and construct fortifications. They ensured the smooth flow of transportation lines and powerfully supported the operations of the infantry and artillery.

    Last winter, the engineers opened up roads for the victorious advance of the infantry and artillery in the snowy mountains. With the victorious advance of our army, they took on the task of repairing and building bridges. The enemy's aircraft妄想妄想 tried to destroy all the bridges on the northern Korean transportation lines to cut off the supply lines of the Korean and Chinese people's forces, but even the US Air Force Secretary Finletter had to admit that their狂妄妄想 attempt had failed. Although many bridges in northern Korea near the combat area had been bombed many times by enemy aircraft, they were repaired as soon as they were bombed. Hundreds and thousands of vehicles and mighty troops of the Korean and Chinese people's forces were still rushing to the front every night.

    During the blocking operations on the Han River front in February and March of this year, two major bridges in a certain area were bombed by enemy aircraft. The engineers of the Volunteer Army said: "We can't let our cars turn back!" The drivers of the cars parked at the bridgehead anxiously asked the engineers if they could repair the bridge in two hours, and the engineers firmly replied: "Yes!" The warriors of a certain company of Volunteer Army engineers and the engineers of the Korean People's Army jointly undertook this urgent task under the strafing of enemy aircraft. These two fraternal engineering units helped each other and competed with each other. Although the weather was still very cold at the time, every engineer was working hard and was covered in sweat. The car drivers waiting to cross the bridge were moved by the working spirit of the engineers and automatically vacated two cars to help them transport wood. The bridge was repaired in two hours. Cars passed over the bridge one after another and drove south. The drivers waved to the engineers to thank them, and the engineers, wiping their sweat, loudly wished the drivers success in completing their tasks.

    Soon, the ice in the river began to thaw, and mountain torrents broke out. The torrents, carrying ice, washed away the two bridges again. The engineers put forward the dual combat task of "defeating enemy aircraft and floods." Communist Party members and New Democratic Youth League members in the Volunteer Army engineering company all made plans for themselves in the bridge repair. Every class held meetings, and everyone thought of ways and offered ideas to overcome the difficulties of lacking tools and equipment. Heroes also put forward the slogan of striving for "more credit on top of credit." This time they cooperated with the engineers of the Korean People's Army again. The engineers of the People's Army went to buy vegetables for the Volunteer Army engineers 30 to 40 li away day and night. The traffic security personnel of Korea guarded near the bridge day and night, detecting the rise and fall of the river water. The Volunteer Army engineers passed through the former enemy minefields on the river bank and went to the deep mountains to cut timber. The Korean people within dozens of miles of the river bank automatically donated grass bags to help transport wood. After the materials were collected, the Chinese and Korean engineers, under the unified command of the head of an engineering office of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, began to build bridges in the torrents夹夹夹着带着巨大冰块. Huang Fuxuan, the deputy company commander of a certain Volunteer Army engineering company, was the first to jump into the icy torrent to drive bridge piles, and the soldiers followed suit and jumped into the water one by one. The rest of the people ran back and forth on the temporary, rickety single-plank bridge, carrying wood and grass bags. A few days later, two brand-new bridges stood on the river amidst the roar of the river, the impact of ice, and the laughter of the soldiers. The Chinese and Korean engineering comrades warmly shook hands on the completed new bridge. In their cheers of "Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people," countless cars sped past on the bridge.

    Before the Chinese and Korean people's forces launched a powerful counterattack, a certain Volunteer Army engineering unit, under the slogan of "Opening up a path to victory for infantry and artillery comrades, and striving to build bridges and make contributions!", spent a very short time架起了架起了架起了 three bridges at a certain place. The engineers brought into play a spirit of selfless work. Li Jingan, the communist party member of the eighth squad leader's foot was pierced by a nail, bleeding non-stop, but he still persisted in his work. In the end, even the cooks and feeders automatically requested to participate in the rush repair. The three bridges were quickly completed.

    The engineers also often built fortifications hundreds of meters away from the enemy in front of our army's positions. The enemy sentries clearly knew that the Volunteer Army engineers were already building fortifications, but they dared not fire because they were afraid that the Volunteer Army would know that they would摸摸摸過去去 at any time. According to the enemy sentries who were captured, they even had to cover their mouths with their hands when they coughed, for fear of being heard by the Volunteer Army. The soldiers laughed after hearing this: "With such cowards who are afraid of death, they still dream of conquering Korea and打中国哩!"

    The engineers tried their best to complete the task of supporting the infantry under any difficult circumstances. During the blocking operation on the Han River front, a certain company of the Volunteer Army defended on Fuli Island in the Han River and repelled countless enemy attacks. Later, due to the rising river water and the enemy's artillery blockade, this company lost contact with the north bank. Yu Xianzhang and other three warriors from a certain engineering unit accepted the task of crossing the river to get in touch with the heroes guarding Fuli Island. Braving the enemy's dense artillery fire, they sat on wooden rafts they had built themselves, pulling telephone lines, and worked continuously for three nights between the river bank and Fuli Island, finally connecting the telephone lines, and transporting food and ammunition to the heroes on Fuli Island, and also transferring the wounded to the north bank of the Han River.

　　坚毅顽强的中、朝工兵们
　　李清烈　徐平
    在朝鲜前线，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的工兵们战胜了敌人飞机、大炮的袭扰，克服了种种困难，紧张地修桥、筑路、构筑工事等等。他们保证了运输线的畅通，有力地支援了步兵和炮兵的作战。
    去年冬天，工兵们曾经在雪山中给步兵和炮兵开辟了胜利前进的道路。随着我军的胜利前进，他们又担负起了修架桥梁的任务。敌人的飞机妄想炸毁朝鲜北部运输线上的一切桥梁，来切断朝、中人民部队的供应，但是连美国的空军部长芬立脱也不得不承认，他们这个狂妄的企图已经失败了。朝鲜北部临近作战地区的许多桥梁虽然都被敌机炸断过多次，可是随炸随修，朝、中人民部队的成百成千辆车辆和浩浩荡荡的部队，还是每夜不停地奔向前方。
    在今年二、三月间汉江前线阻击战中，某地的两座主要桥梁被敌机炸断了。志愿军的工兵们说：“不能让我们的汽车走回头路！”停在桥头的汽车司机们焦急地问工兵能不能在两小时中把桥修好，工兵们坚决地回答：“能够！”志愿军工兵某连的勇士们和朝鲜人民军的工兵们在敌机扫射下共同担负了这个紧迫的任务。这两支兄弟工兵部队一面互助，一面竞赛。虽然当时气候还很冷，可是工兵们每个人都紧张地劳动，满身是汗。等候过桥的汽车司机们被工兵们的工作精神所感动，也自动腾出两部汽车来帮他们运木料。两小时，桥就修好了。汽车一辆接着一辆经过桥上向南开去。司机们向工兵们挥手致谢，工兵们一面擦着汗，一面高声预祝司机们胜利完成任务。
    不久，河里的冰开始解冻，山洪暴发。激流带着冰块，又把这两座桥冲垮了。工兵们提出了“战胜敌机和洪水”的双重战斗任务。志愿军工兵连队里的共产党员和新民主主义青年团员们都订出了自己在抢修桥梁中的计划。每个班都召开会议，大家想办法，人人出主意，来克服缺乏工具器材的困难。功臣们也提出了争取“功上加功”的口号。这一次他们又与朝鲜人民军的工兵们合作。人民军的工兵们昼夜不停地到三、四十里路外去代志愿军工兵买菜。朝鲜的交通公安员日夜在桥附近警戒，探测江水涨落情况。志愿军的工兵们通过江边上的从前敌人的布雷区，到深山中去采伐木材。江边数十里内的朝鲜人民自动捐出草袋，帮助运木料。材料征集齐了以后，中朝工兵们就在朝鲜人民军某部工程处处长统一指挥下，开始在夹着巨大冰块的激流中架桥。志愿军工兵某连的副连长黄福轩首先跳入冰冷刺骨的激流中去打桥桩，战士们跟着就一个个跳下水去。其余的人在临时搭起来的摇摇幌幌的独木桥上来回跑着，搬运木料、草袋。几天之后，两座崭新的桥梁就在江涛的吼叫声、冰块的冲击声和战士们的欢笑声中耸立在江上了。中朝两国的工兵战友们在落成的新桥上热烈地握着手。在他们的“中朝人民的战斗友谊万岁”的欢呼声中，数不清的汽车从桥上奔驰过去。
    在朝中人民部队发起强大反击之前，志愿军某工兵部队在“为步兵、炮兵战友开辟胜利道路，争取架桥立功！”的口号下，花了很短时间，在某处架起了三座桥梁。工兵们发挥了奋不顾身的工作精神。八班长共产党员李敬安的脚被钉子扎了一个洞，血流不止，还照样坚持工作。最后，连炊事员、饲养员都自动要求参加抢修。三座桥梁很快就落成了。
    工兵们还经常在我军阵地前沿距敌人数百公尺处修筑工事。敌人哨兵明明知道志愿军的工兵们已经在筑工事了，可是他们却不敢开枪，因为怕志愿军知道他们随时会摸过去。据俘掳来的敌人哨兵说，他们连咳嗽都要用手掩住嘴，怕被志愿军听到了。战士们听了嘲笑说：“就凭这样的怕死鬼，还梦想征服朝鲜打中国哩！”
    工兵们在任何困难情况下都尽力完成支援步兵的任务。在汉江前线阻击战中，志愿军某连守卫在汉江中的浮里岛上，击退了敌人无数次攻击。后来因为江水上涨和敌人炮火封锁，这个连和北岸断了联络。工兵某部的于宪章等三勇士接受了渡江去与守卫浮里岛的英雄们取得联络的任务。他们冒着敌人密集的炮火，坐着自己扎的木排，拉着电话线，在江岸和浮里岛之间连续工作三夜，终于接通了电话线，并且给浮里岛上的英雄们运去了粮食和弹药，还把伤员转运到汉江北岸来。
