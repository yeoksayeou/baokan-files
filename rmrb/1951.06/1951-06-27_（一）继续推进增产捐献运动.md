(I) Continue to Promote the Increase Production and Donation Movement

The national movement of donating weapons has made great progress. Since this association launched this movement on the 1st of this month, up to the 25th of this month, in just over twenty days, people from all over the country have pledged and initiated the donation of 1,216 aircraft, in addition to 79 cannons, 29 anti-aircraft guns, and 7 tanks. Currently, the patriotic donation movement of people from all over the country is continuing to develop.

To keep the donation movement moving forward, there are some issues that local leading organs need to pay attention to and resolve.

First, it is necessary to do a good job of publicity. The donation movement in many places has not yet penetrated the masses. In many places, the number of weapons pledged was decided or initiated by representatives and activists from all walks of life based on the local situation, which is of course necessary. But then, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity to the people, calling on the masses to strive to increase production and donate on a conscious and voluntary basis, based on their actual situation.

Second, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of combining with the movement to increase production and increase income. It is imperative that this patriotic donation movement becomes a driving force for promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational work. For this purpose, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to formulate a six-month plan to increase production, increase income, and donate weapons, and list it as an important item in the patriotic pact.

Third, it is necessary to be realistic. Donating weapons to support the front is the duty of all compatriots across the country. Therefore, on the one hand, every place and every person in the country should be made to participate in this patriotic action. On the other hand, how much each person donates and how to donate should be based on each person's conscious volition and actual capabilities. We welcome retired military and civilian officials and wealthy households to donate to defend the country, and we welcome industrialists and businessmen to make donations to the best of their ability, in conjunction with increasing production, improving management, and reducing waste. They are relatively capable of donating, so they can donate more. As for the broad masses of working people, especially some of those living in more difficult circumstances, we hope that they will highly promote the spirit of patriotism and use the method of increasing production to donate weapons; however, since their donating ability is smaller, they can of course donate less. It is absolutely impermissible to disregard the actual situation and blindly aim high, thereby lowering the living standards of the working people.

In order to be realistic, it is also necessary to avoid the phenomenon of repeated donations. Some people now have multiple identities, such as some college students who are members of democratic parties and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; some workers are also students of amateur schools, and so on. If they repeatedly participate in the donations of these different groups, many difficulties will arise. Therefore, in principle, they should only be allowed to participate in one donation and should not be allowed to participate repeatedly.

### （一）继续推进增产捐献运动

  （一）继续推进增产捐献运动
    全国人民的捐献武器运动已有很大进展。自本会于本月一日发起这一运动以来，到本月二十五日为止，只有二十多天的时间，各地各界人民认捐和发起捐献的飞机已经有一千二百十六架，此外还有大炮七十九门，高射炮二十九门，坦克七辆。目前各地各界人民的爱国捐献运动，正在继续发展。
    要使捐献运动继续前进，有一些问题是需要各地领导机关注意解决的。
    第一就是要做好宣传工作。现在许多地方的捐献运动还没有深入到群众中去。许多地方认捐武器的数字是由各界的代表人物和积极分子根据当地情况商议决定或发起的，这当然是必要的。但是接着，就需要向人民群众作广泛深入的宣传，号召群众在自觉自愿的基础上，根据自己的实际情况，来努力增产捐献。
    第二就是要坚持与增加生产、增加收入的运动相结合的原则。一定要使这次爱国捐献运动，成为推动工农业生产和文化教育工作向前发展的动力。为此目的，就要发动群众订出半年的增加生产、增加收入捐献武器的计划，并把它列为爱国公约的一项重要项目。
    第三就是要实事求是。捐献武器，支援前线，是全国同胞人人应尽的职责。因此，应使全国每处每人都来参加这个爱国行动，这是一方面。另一方面，每个人捐献多少、如何捐献，是要根据各人的自觉自愿并根据各人的实际可能来决定的。我们欢迎退职的文武官员及富户捐输卫国，我们欢迎工商业者就其力之所能及并与增加生产、改善经营、减少浪费相结合来进行捐献。他们是比较有捐献能力的，所以他们可以多捐献一些。至于广大的劳动群众，特别是一部分生活比较困难的群众，我们希望他们高度发扬爱国主义的精神，用增加生产的方法，来捐献武器；但是由于他们的捐献能力小一些，所以他们当然可以少捐献一些。决不可不顾实际情况，一味向高处看齐，以致降低劳动群众的生活水平。
    为了实事求是，还要避免重复捐献的现象。现在有一部分人是具有多重身份的，例如有些大学生是民主党派的党员，又是中苏友好协会的会员；有些工人，又是业余学校的学员等等。如果他们重复地参加这些不同团体的捐献，就会发生很多困难。因此，原则上应该只让他们参加一次捐献，而不应该让他们重复参加。
