To the Editor,
Pingyuan Province Huojia County Public Security Bureau:

Some Comrades Neglect Political Study

The Party newspaper is one of the most powerful weapons for conducting political education and guiding practical work, and everyone should read the newspaper carefully. Recently, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government decided that every administrative village and every village primary school should regularly subscribe to the Pingyuan Daily. This measure is very correct. However, although some agencies subscribe to newspapers, they do not read them carefully. For example, the Huojia County Public Security Bureau subscribes to one copy each of the People's Daily and the Pingyuan Daily. When the newspapers arrive, they are piled up in the newspaper pile in the dispatch room, and the comrades rarely look at them. Therefore, many comrades know very little or are not timely informed about current events. The Pingyuan Daily recently published a front-page headline about seventeen counties in the province suffering from hail disasters and the provincial government issuing emergency instructions. When some comrades in the Public Security Bureau heard others talking about this, they said that others were spreading rumors. For example, recently the People's Daily has continuously published many articles criticizing Wu Xun, and has published editorials calling on everyone to pay attention to the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun"; but most of the comrades in the Public Security Bureau do not know about this.

I think that the failure of some comrades in the Huojia County Public Security Bureau to read newspapers is an erroneous tendency to ignore politics, and a manifestation of low political awareness and political paralysis. Although the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee has issued a circular on "opposing the tendency to ignore politics" and the People's Daily has published this circular; they still do not pay attention to politics. This erroneous tendency may also exist in other agencies; I hope you will publish this letter to draw their attention, overcome this tendency to ignore politics, and make our work better.

　　平原省获嘉县公安局
    有些同志忽视政治学习编辑同志：
    党报是进行政治教育指导实际工作的最有力的武器之一，人人都应当认真地阅读报纸。最近平原省人民政府决定：每个行政村及每个村小学都要经常订阅平原日报，这个措施是非常正确的。但是有些机关虽然订有报纸，他们仍不认真阅读。如获嘉县公安局订有人民日报、平原日报各一份，报纸一来便被堆在收发室的报纸堆上，同志们很少去看。因此，很多同志对当前时事了解得很少或不及时。平原日报最近在一版头条地位刊载了本省十七个县受雹灾、省府发出紧急指示的消息，公安局有些同志听旁人说起这事，还说旁人造谣。又如最近人民日报连续发表了很多批判武训的文章，并曾发表社论，号召大家重视电影《武训传》的讨论；但公安局绝大部分同志都不知道这回事。
    我认为，获嘉县公安局某些同志不阅读报纸是一种不问政治的错误倾向，是政治觉悟不高、政治上麻痹的表现。虽然新乡地委已发出了“反对不问政治的倾向”的通报，人民日报也已刊登了这一通报；但他们却仍对政治不加注意。这种错误倾向，可能其他机关也有；希望你们把这封信登出来，提起他们的注意，克服这种不问政治的倾向，使我们的工作做得更好。
