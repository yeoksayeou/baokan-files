　　Revenge for the Children Who Died Tragically in the Bloodstained Hands of Imperialism
　　Rong Mengyuan
　　Ever since foreign missionaries invaded our country with the cannons of imperialism, they have established so-called "Foundling Homes," "Charity Hospitals," and "Orphanages." Hiding behind the banner of "humanitarianism," they ruthlessly murdered Chinese children. As early as 1862, the people of Nanchang pointed out that foreign missionaries harmed infants and "abused the young," demanding the expulsion of the invaders. Tens of thousands of copies of the "Public Notice to Eradicate Heretical Cults" were printed overnight, spreading throughout the streets and alleys of the provincial capital, with "resentful words and feelings almost irreconcilable" (Shen Baozhen's memorial). Although the Manchu Qing government helped imperialism suppress the people, it could not conceal the crimes of the foreign missionaries. Xia Xie, a member of the staff of Jiangxi Governor Shen Baozhen, stated in his book "Chronicles of China and the West" that French missionaries such as Luo Andang (Rohan d'Argouges) harmed Chinese children, and that "the circumstances are all suspicious."
　　In 1870, incidents of child abduction occurred in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhili (Hebei) provinces. In Tianjin, "criminals who abducted people confessed in court that they were instructed by the head of the Catholic Church" (Xian County Catholic Church Publication: "Study of the Propagation of Catholicism in China"). As a result, the people were outraged and gathered in front of the Catholic Church to demand justice. The French priest brought in the French Consul Fontanier, who slashed at the people with his sword and shot Tianjin County Magistrate Liu Jie, further angering the people, who then burned down the Catholic Church and beat to death Fontanier and other French missionaries. When the people of Tianjin rescued children who had been harmed by foreign missionaries and found the cellar of the "Charity Hospital," they discovered "more than ten children in the cellar, who had already suffocated from the fire and smoke" ("Study of the Propagation of Catholicism in China"). The Manchu Qing government sent the Han Chinese traitor and executioner Zeng Guofan to handle the matter, who killed twenty civilians, imprisoned twenty-five civilians, and compensated French imperialism with 250,000 taels of silver. Zeng Guofan was a Han Chinese traitor and executioner who helped imperialism massacre the Chinese people, but in his memorial he still confessed to the crimes of foreign missionaries harming Chinese children. First, he confessed that foreign missionaries abducted children: "Chinese people who go to the Charity Hospital for treatment are often kept there and not allowed to leave… Furthermore, those sent to Tianjin by carts and ships number in the dozens or hundreds, all of whom are seen entering but not seen leaving, and the reason is unknown." He also confessed that foreign missionaries mistreated children: "Churches and Charity Hospitals all have cellars. The people of Tianjin have not all witnessed it, but they have heard that the cellars are deep and that young children are confined within." He further confessed that foreign missionaries had killed many Chinese children: "In April and May of this year, there were too many deaths in the hospital. The burials were often done at night, and sometimes two or three corpses were placed in the same coffin. On the sixth day of the fifth month, in the public cemetery east of the river, dogs uncovered a coffin containing two corpses, which was witnessed by Zuo Baogui, the Tianjin Garrison Middle Camp guerrilla. The corpses were rotten from the inside out, but these were rotten from the outside in, the chest and abdomen were rotten, and the intestines were exposed (it can be seen that they died from mistreatment—Rong's note). As a result, rumors spread widely." He further confessed that he dared not truthfully reveal the matter of foreign missionaries harming Chinese children. In his "Memorial Further Reporting on the Tianjin Incident," he said: The previous memorial "did not speak truthfully or completely about the abduction, fearing that it would hinder the peace… The foreigners will certainly not admit that they are in the wrong at this time, so it is better to be vague about it, so that they have room to maneuver." The Han Chinese traitors and betrayers of the country helped imperialism slaughter the Chinese people in this way, and the sins of foreign missionaries harming Chinese children naturally became even more rampant.
　　The Chinese people will never allow foreign missionaries to harm their children. Under the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, the Chinese people waged a tenacious struggle to protect their children. Thus, resistance to foreign missionaries harming children became one of the important reasons for the anti-church incidents, the so-called "religious cases," of the past century. In 1871, 1878, and 1880, the people of Nantong, Jiangsu, launched several struggles against foreign missionaries harming children (Shanghai Cimu Church Publication: "Orthodox Faith Transmitted"). In 1887, the people of Wuhu launched a struggle against foreign missionaries harming children (ibid.). For decades, the people of Sichuan continuously launched struggles against foreign missionaries harming children ("Study of the Propagation of Catholicism in China"). In 1891, Catholic believers in Guangji County, Hubei Province, carried four young children on shoulder poles and were about to send them to the Jiujiang Catholic Church. When they arrived at the Wuxue Church, they were seen by Guo Liushou and others. In an instant, the people gathered and destroyed the Wuxue Church (Zhang Zhidong: "Memorial Reporting on the Handling of the Wuxue Religious Case"). The people of Yichang, Danyang, Guangde, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Jiujiang, Shanghai, and Chaoyang (in Rehe Province) north of the Great Wall all rose up to resist foreign missionaries harming Chinese children. However, the Manchu Qing government repeatedly helped imperialism suppress the Chinese people's anti-imperialist movement, so the crimes of imperialism harming our Chinese children were never concealed.
　　According to the "Statistics of Religious Affairs in China," published annually by the Xujiahui Catholic Church in Shanghai, the number of infants received and cared for by the Holy Childhood Association (a Catholic organization specializing in receiving infants, founded in France in 1843) from 1928 to 1935:
　　Year　　　　Received　　　　Cared for　　　　Percentage of cared for to received
　　1928　　　　34,144　　　　17,720　　　　51.89
　　1929　　　　38,852　　　　21,172　　　　54.44
　　1930　　　　38,455　　　　20,568　　　　53.48
　　1931　　　　36,570　　　　16,324　　　　41.90
　　1932　　　　45,195　　　　20,968　　　　46.36
　　1933　　　　43,521　　　　24,888　　　　57.19
　　1934　　　　46,450　　　　27,237　　　　58.63
　　1935　　　　49,119　　　　22,536　　　　45.88
　　Of the infants received each year, only 40 to 50 percent are cared for. Where did the remaining 40 to 50 percent go? In a word, "they died!" Furthermore, considering that the number cared for includes the infants cared for in the previous year, it can be seen that the number of infant deaths is not just 40 to 50 percent of the number received, but 60 to 70 to 80 to 90 percent of the number received. According to the registration stub of the Xingtai Catholic Church receiving infants, "eight out of ten starved to death, and in 1943 alone, 619 infants died." Imperialist Ge Lecai (Bernardin Collin O.F.M., then Bishop of Xingtai) also admitted in a letter to the government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region that infants "died due to lack of adequate nutrition, with 559 deaths." Recently, the People's Daily revealed that the number of Chinese children harmed by foreign missionaries in Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other places often numbered in the thousands. In the past century, the number of "orphanages" and "foundling homes" run by foreign missionaries has increased year by year, and the number of our Chinese children harmed has naturally gradually increased. In the end, how many Chinese children were harmed by these imperialists? This number, this blood debt, cannot be counted.
　　In the past century, tens of millions of our Chinese children have been brutally murdered by foreign missionaries, and those who survived have been forced by foreign missionaries, from the age of eight, "to engage in heavy labor such as husking rice, carrying water, weaving cloth, and growing vegetables, seriously hindering the normal development of their bodies" (People's Daily, April 11); tens of millions of children were tortured by foreign missionaries to the point of being "skeleton-like," with one person suffering from nine different diseases (People's Daily, March 9). This is intolerable! Patriotic Catholics are right to say that imperialists send foreign missionaries to "infringe on the interests of the Chinese people, which is intolerable to us Chinese people and Chinese church members!" Yes, we Chinese people cannot tolerate it. "We can no longer allow American imperialism to harm our second generation!" We must avenge the children who died tragically in the bloodstained hands of imperialism!

　　为惨死在帝国主义血手中的儿童复仇
    荣孟源
    自从洋教士随着帝国主义的大炮侵入我国以来，就设立了所谓“育婴堂”、“仁慈院”、“孤儿院”等。他们躲在“人道主义”的招牌后面，毒辣地残杀我国儿童。早在一八六二年，南昌人民就指出洋教士残害婴儿、“虐及黄口”，要求驱逐侵略者。一日夜印刷“扑灭异端邪教公启”数万张，遍播省城内外通衢，“怨愤情词，几有不共戴天之势”（沈葆桢奏折）。满清政府虽然帮助帝国主义压制人民，但是无法掩饰洋教士的罪行。江西巡抚沈葆桢的幕府夏燮，在其所著的《中西纪事》一书中，就说法教士罗安当等残害中国儿童，“此中情形，种种可疑”。
    一八七○年，湖南、江西、湖北、江苏、直隶各地都有迷拐儿童事件发生。在天津，“迷拐人口之犯，被拿到官，则当堂直供，系天主教主使”（献县天主堂印：《天主教传行中国考》）。因此人心大愤，众集天主堂前讲理。法国教士找来法国领事丰大业，剑砍百姓，枪击天津知县刘杰，更激怒人民，遂焚毁天主堂，殴死丰大业和法国教士等侵略者。天津人民为抢救被洋教士残害的儿童，找到“仁慈堂”地窖时，发现儿童“十余名，在地窖中，已被火烟郁毙”（《天主教传行中国考》）。满清政府派汉奸刽子手曾国藩处理此事，竟杀死平民二十人，监禁平民二十五人，赔偿法帝国主义白银二十五万两。曾国藩是帮助帝国主义来屠杀中国人民的汉奸、刽子手，但是在他的奏折中还是供出了洋教士残害中国儿童的罪行。他首先供出了洋教士迷拐儿童：“中国人民有至仁慈堂治病者，往往被留不令复出。……又由车船致送来津者，动辄数十百人，皆但见其入而不见其出，不明何故。”他又供出了洋教士虐待儿童：“教堂、仁慈堂皆有地窖。津民未尽目睹，但闻地窖深邃，各幼孩幽闭其中。”他又供出了洋教士曾害死许多我国儿童：“本年四、五月间，堂中死人过多。其掩埋又多以夜，或有两尸三尸共一棺者。五月初六日河东丛冢有为狗所发者一棺二尸，天津镇中营游击左宝贵等曾经目睹。死人皆由内先腐，此独由外先腐，胸腹皆烂，肠肚外露（可知系虐待而死—荣注）。由是浮言大起。”（《查明津案大概情形折》）他更供出了对于洋教士残害中国儿童一事，不敢据实说出。他在“复陈津事各情折”中说：前奏“于迷拐一节，言之不实不尽，诚恐有碍和局。……洋人此时断不肯自认理亏，不如浑含出之，使彼有转圆之地。”汉奸卖国贼这样帮助帝国主义屠杀中国人民，洋教士残害中国儿童的罪孽，自然更是变本加厉。
    中国人民决不允许洋教士残害自己的儿女。在帝国主义、封建主义的压迫之下，中国人民进行着保护自己儿女的顽强斗争。于是反抗洋教士残害儿童，就成为近百年来中国人民反抗教堂事件、即所谓“教案”的重要原因之一。一八七一、一八七八、一八八○年，江苏南通人民几次发起反抗洋教士残害儿童的斗争（上海慈母堂出版：《正教奉传》）。一八八七年芜湖人民曾发起反抗洋教士残害儿童的斗争（同上）。数十年间四川人民连续不断地发起反抗洋教士残害儿童的斗争（《天主教传行中国考》）。一八九一年湖北广济县天主教民肩挑幼孩四人，将送往九江天主堂，行至武穴教堂，为郭六寿等人所见，顷刻之间，人民群集，捣毁武穴教堂（张之洞：《奏陈办结武穴教案情形折》）。宜昌、丹阳、广德、无锡、江阴、九江、上海以及长城以北的朝阳（热河省属）等处人民，均群起反抗洋教士残害我国儿童。但满清政府屡次帮助帝国主义压制中国人民的反对帝国主义运动，因此帝国主义残害我中国儿童的罪行，终不敛迹。
    根据上海徐家汇天主堂每年出版的“中华全国教务统计”所载，圣婴会（天主教中专门办理收容婴儿的组织，一八四三年成立于法国）于一九二八年到一九三五年八年间收容与抚养婴儿的数目：
   年次        收容数目        抚养数目      抚养对收容的百分比
    一九二八    三四，一四四    一七，七二○    五一·八九
    一九二九    三八，八五二    二一，一七二    五四·四四
    一九三○    三八，四五五    二○，五六八    五三·四八
    一九三一    三六，五七○    一六，三二四    四一·九○
    一九三二    四五，一九五    二○，九六八    四六·三六
    一九三三    四三，五二一    二四，八八八    五七·一九
    一九三四    四六，四五○    二七，二三七    五八·六三
    一九三五    四九，一一九    二二，五三六    四五·八八
    每年收容的婴儿，只抚养百分之四十几到五十几，所余的百分之四十几到五十几那儿去了呢？一句话，“死了！”再看抚养数目中，包括了上一年所抚养的婴儿在内，那么可知婴儿死亡数目不只是收容数目的百分之四、五十，而是收容数目的六、七十到八、九十。按邢台天主堂收容婴儿的登记存根来说，是“十个饿死八个，计一九四三年全年婴儿死亡达六百一十九名”。帝国主义分子葛乐才（当时邢台主教）在致晋冀鲁豫边区政府的公函中，也还承认婴儿们“由于缺乏丰富的营养，死亡了五百五十九名”。最近人民日报所披露的广州、南京等地洋教士残害我国儿童的数目，动辄千百。近百年来，洋教士所办的“孤儿院”、“育婴堂”等逐年增加，其残害我中国儿童的数目自然也逐渐扩大。到底这些帝国主义分子残害了我国多少儿童，这个数目、这笔血债是无法统计的。
    近百年来，我中国千万儿童被洋教士惨杀了，其幸存者又被洋教士逼迫着，从八岁起，“就要从事砻谷、挑水、织布、种菜等繁重的劳动，严重地妨害了身体的正常发育”（四月十一日《人民日报》）；千万的儿童被洋教士折磨得“形同骷髅”，一人身上竟患着九种不同的病症（三月九日《人民日报》）。斯可忍，孰不可忍！爱国的天主教人士们说得对，帝国主义派洋教士来“侵害中国人民的利益，这是我们中国人民、中国教友所不能容忍的！”是的，我们中国人民不能容忍了。“我们再不能让美帝国主义残害我们的第二代！”我们要为惨死在帝国主义血手中的儿童复仇！
