The Ma Hengchang Group advocates the mutual transmission of technology, never "holding back." They treat every individual's hard-earned experience as everyone's asset and promote it nationwide. As a result, the workers and apprentices within the group have improved their skills rapidly. The picture shows Comrade Ma Hengchang patiently teaching technical skills to an apprentice.

The Ma Hengchang Group combines labor intensity with technical research. They don't rely solely on labor intensity; instead, they constantly improve production tools and change labor organization, which keeps the competition going without slacking off. The picture shows Ma Hengchang and technicians studying the usage of the gear shaping machine tool.

The Ma Hengchang Group is an advanced production group. It originally had ten workers and three apprentices. Because of good working methods, they have overfulfilled their tasks every month since April 1949 and have also ensured that the quality meets the standards. Eight workers in the group did not produce a single defective product throughout the year, and everyone in the group has made contributions to production. In the past year alone, they improved 18 tools of various sizes and created 25 new records. In May of this year, the Ma Hengchang Group also fulfilled the challenge conditions they proposed to workers nationwide. The entire group completed the monthly production task four days and six hours ahead of schedule in May; the product quality reached 99.7%; they improved one tool, created two tools, and shortened the production time for five types of work; the attendance rate reached 99.2%. The picture shows labor model Comrade Ma Hengchang in front of a lathe.

The workers in the Ma Hengchang Group can unite, help each other, and make progress together. The picture shows Comrade Ma Hengchang immediately going to help solve a problem when a fellow worker encounters difficulties in their work, so as not to affect production.

The key to the Ma Hengchang Group's consolidating its achievements and persevering is that they have established weekly production review meetings as a system. This allows everyone's shortcomings and mistakes in every matter to receive help from others. The picture shows the Ma Hengchang Group holding a production review meeting on the weekend to summarize the week's work experience.

The Ma Hengchang Group strives to improve product quality. They implement the "assembly line method" and correct problems at any time during the work. The picture shows the technicians of the Ma Hengchang Group studying technology with Ma Hengchang and others in the workshop, correcting problems in a timely manner, so as to further improve product quality.

The Ma Hengchang Group has established a strict inspection system. The picture shows the Ma Hengchang Group inspecting the first workpiece.

The Ma Hengchang Group has established a strict system of protecting machines and taking responsibility for shifts, so that every worker regards the machines and production as their own belongings and their own business. The picture shows the workers of the Ma Hengchang Group writing a note on the machine before leaving work, telling the relieving workers the matters that should be paid attention to.

The Liu Dezhen Steam Turbine Repair Group of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant was the first group in the country to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. The Liu Dezhen Group had already started the patriotic labor competition on September 18, 1950, and until April 11, 1951, a total of 205 days, there were no major accidents in the safe operation of the steam turbine plant.

After the Mu Chengen Group of the Meter Repair Room of the Tianjin Waterworks responded to the patriotic labor competition challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, it changed from an ununited, technically conservative group to a united and mutually helpful group that exchanges experiences, thus greatly improving the quality of products.

Zhang Huaiyu of the Foundry Workshop of the Jinan Railway Administration Factory increased the daily output of brake shoes from 15 boxes to 160 boxes after launching the patriotic labor competition, setting a national record. And he responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, making the work even better. This is Zhang Huaiyu and the workers in the group actively studying and transforming the brake shoe making tools.

The Liu Jigao Group of the Turning Department of Factory No. 1 of the Jinan Municipal Industrial Bureau put forward the slogan of overcoming all difficulties and learning from the advanced Ma Hengchang Group. They have created good achievements in all aspects of completing production tasks, improving and creating tools, saving raw materials, reducing costs, and uniting and helping each other. Therefore, they won the title of Ma Hengchang-style model group in the whole factory. The picture shows Comrade Sun Jiashou of the Liu Jigao Group watching two lathes alone. He lets apprentices supervise the lathes that are already running, and he himself goes to watch the grinding machine.

The first group in Shanghai to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group was the Lu Agou Group of the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory. The picture shows that in order to improve product quality, the Lu Agou Group has a technical research meeting every two weeks, inviting the factory's technicians to give technical lectures, and combining theory to analyze the steel properties from sparks.

　　马恒昌小组提倡技术互相传授，决不“留一手”。他们把每个人钻研出来的经验，当成大伙的本钱，还推广到全国。因此使得组内的工人、学徒的技术，提高得很快。图为马恒昌同志耐心地将技术教给徒工。
　　马恒昌小组把劳动强度和钻研技术相结合。他们不单凭劳动强度；而是不断地改进生产工具，改变劳动组织，这样就能使竞赛保持长期不松劲。图为马恒昌和技术员等研究铲齿机工具的使用方法。
　　马恒昌小组，是一个先进生产小组。原有工人十名，徒工三名。因为工作办法好，从一九四九年四月以来，每月都超额完成任务，还保证质量都合规格。组里有八个工人，全年不出一件废品，全组每个人都在生产上立过功。仅去年一年，就改进了大小工具十八种，创造了二十五种新纪录。今年五月份，马恒昌小组又实现了向全国工人提出的挑战条件。全组在五月份提前四天零六小时完成了全月生产任务；产品质量达到百分之九十九点七；改进工具一种，创造工具二种，缩短了五种工作的生产时间，出勤率达到百分之九十九点二。图为在镟床前的劳动模范马恒昌同志。
　　马恒昌小组中的工人都能团结互助，共同进步。图为工友在工作中发生了困难，马恒昌同志立刻前往帮助解决，使其不影响生产。
　　马恒昌小组巩固成绩，坚持下去的关键在于他们把每周开生产检讨会定为一种制度。这样可以使每个人每件事情的缺点和过错，都能得到别人的帮助。图为马恒昌小组在周末开生产检讨会，总结一周的工作经验。
　　马恒昌小组努力提高产品的质量。他们实行“流水作业法”；并在工作中随时纠正毛病。图为马恒昌小组的技术员在车间和马恒昌等研究技术，及时纠正毛病，使产品的质量提高一步。
　　马恒昌小组建立了严格的检查制度。图为马恒昌小组正在检查第一个活。
　　马恒昌小组建立了严格的保护机器和负责交班制，这样可以使得每个工人都把机器和生产，当作自己的东西和自己的事情。图为马恒昌小组的工人在下班前写纸条放在机器上，告诉接班工人应注意的事项。
　　北京石景山发电厂刘德珍汽机检修小组，是全国第一个向马恒昌小组应战的小组。刘德珍小组从一九五○年九月十八日就已经开始展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛，直到一九五一年四月十一日止共二百零五天，汽机场的安全转运没有发生重大事故。
    天津市自来水厂修表房穆成恩小组，自响应马恒昌小组爱国主义劳动竞赛的挑战后，由不团结、技术保守而一变为团结互助、交流经验的小组，因而使得产品的质量大大提高。
    济南铁路管理局工厂铸工场的张怀玉，在展开爱国主义劳动竞赛后，由日产十五箱闸瓦增到一百六十箱，首创全国纪录。并且向马恒昌小组应战，使工作更提高一步。这是张怀玉和组里的工友们在积极地研究改造制闸瓦工具。
　　济南市工业局一厂车工部刘继高小组，提出克服一切困难，向先进的马恒昌小组学习的口号。在完成了生产任务、改进与创造工具、节省原料、降低成本、团结互助等各方面，都创造了良好的成绩。因此，在全厂获得马恒昌式模范小组的称号。图为刘继高小组的孙家绶同志一个人看二部车床，他让学徒看管已经走刀的车床，他自己又去看磨床。
　　上海第一个向马恒昌小组应战的是国营上海第二纺织机械厂的陆阿狗小组。图为陆阿狗小组为了提高产品的质量，每二周有一次技术研究会，请厂内的技术人员讲技术，并结合理论从火花中分析钢性。
