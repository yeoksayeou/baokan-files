Examples of Catholic Scum Aiding the American-Chiang Bandit Gang in Their Anti-People Civil War
	Lin Hong
	One of the methods used by imperialist elements and their running dogs to undermine the Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement is to insist that Catholicism is "supra-national," "supra-political," and "unconnected to imperialism." But in fact, certain scum within Catholicism are precisely using this tattered banner of "supra-political" to specifically assist the American-Chiang bandit gang in their anti-people activities. We can find many self-incriminating pieces of evidence from the Catholic publication *Yi Shi Weekly*, which is run by Yu Bin.

		Using Catholicism to Establish Reactionary Organizations to Help Chiang's Bandits Wage Civil War
	After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the support of American imperialism, launched an anti-communist, anti-people civil war. Catholic scum actively established reactionary organizations to help American war-mongers and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang massacre the Chinese people. In *Yi Shi Weekly*, volume 29, issue 21, an article titled *Rise Up, Fellow Catholics!* and signed "Rang" brazenly stated that Catholicism "should find ways to cultivate more political talent and actively participate in political activities, and the organization of a Catholic party—or Public Catholic party—is now timely." What kind of political activities should they participate in? Throwing themselves into the arms of imperialism to oppose communism and the people. Volume 30, issue 3 of the publication admits that "The Chinese Religious Believers Friendship Association, in order to mobilize religious believers across the country to unanimously participate in the suppression of the rebellion and national salvation work (note: that is, Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war), specially dispatched Secretary-General Wei Limin to various places for supervision." The Chiang bandit Kai-shek, in order to "commend" the reactionary organization, specially "presented the plaque 'Revitalize Religion and Build the Nation.'" The famous spy, Belgian priest Lei Zhenyuan, also organized the "People's Nation-Building Association" in five provinces of North China, actively engaging in espionage activities.
	Catholic scum such as Yu Bin spent their days running between the residences of Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Wei Lihuang, and Li Zongren, recruiting special agents, spies, and organizing reactionary armed forces for them. For example, as admitted in volume 29, issue 3 of the publication, Yu Bin, "in order to save the crisis in the Northeast" (that is, to more cruelly slaughter the people of the Northeast), had "contributed" several suggestions to the Chiang bandit Kai-shek in person, especially the suggestion of "actively mobilizing popular organizations, enriching local military forces, and expanding the system of the pacification general headquarters," which was "greatly approved" by the Chiang bandit Kai-shek. But despite Yu Bin's suggestions being so "approved" by the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, it ultimately did not save the Kuomintang reactionaries from their fate of destruction.
	In July 1947, when American war-monger Wedemeyer came to China to help the Chiang bandit Kai-shek plan further strengthening of the anti-people civil war, Yu Bin claimed to be "a local personage" offering "consultation," but in reality, he was presenting treasonous schemes to his master. Yu Bin, shocked by the rapid growth of the people's forces in the Northeast at that time, had requested Wedemeyer in person to make a trip to the Northeast in order to "conduct on-the-spot investigations" and obtain "sufficiently needed information." Thus, at his "earnest request," Wedemeyer made a trip to the Northeast, causing the people of the Northeast to suffer even greater pain. The Chinese people will not forget this blood debt.

		Striving for "American Aid" for Chiang's Bandits, Advocating American Military Aggression Against China
	Yu Bin, Mao Zhenxiang, and their ilk were particularly enthusiastic about requesting American aid for the Chiang bandit Kai-shek, even openly advocating that the United States should carry out military aggression against China. In the two months at the end of 1947, when Yu Bin was in the United States, he hastily gave speeches everywhere in order to obtain so-called American aid, and successively visited war-mongers such as Truman, Taft, Dewey, Bullitt, Zhou Yide, and Luce, pleading with them bitterly. When the United States Congress passed a bill in November 1947 to give 18 million US dollars to the Chiang bandit Kai-shek as capital to continue killing the Chinese people, Yu Bin was beside himself with joy, and greatly praised the reactionary foreign policy of the United States. Yu Bin's powerful henchman, the famous American spy and general manager of the Nanjing Archdiocese, Mao Zhenxiang, also ran to the United States in early 1948, giving speeches everywhere, openly advocating that the United States should provide military aid to the Chiang bandit Kai-shek. But because the civil war launched by the Chiang bandit gang was anti-people, no matter how much American imperialism "aided," it could not save it from its fate of failure.

		Organizing Reactionary Armed Forces to Directly Slaughter the People
	This group of Catholic scum, in order to save Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule and help the United States realize its conspiracy to invade China, not only ran around, promoted reactionary ideas, offered "brilliant plans" to Chiang Kai-shek, and actively called for American aid, but also wanted to organize a so-called "anti-communist crusade" to fight the people. Thus, this further tore apart the disguise of Catholicism's "non-participation in political activities." In the article *From Christmas to National Salvation through Suppression of the Rebellion*, Zhong Guoping howled: "Advocating that Catholics should enlist to kill bandits (referring to the Chinese people as 'bandits,' which reveals the true nature of being 'supra-political'), is now an urgent matter. History has examples of Catholics organizing troops... It is impossible to oppose communism empty-handed, so in the face of a major crisis, it will not work without armed forces." *Yi Shi Weekly* continuously published many news items about Catholic reactionary armed activities, such as "The Catholic armed organization in ×× City, Hebei Province, has achieved excellent results and has won high praise from military leaders (referring to the bandit leaders of Chiang's bandit army)." Another example is "Recently, Catholic soldiers in Shandong have also responded to the organization of the '999' unit, with Father Wan Fengcheng serving as the camp instructor. The cadres and main officers of the team are Catholic friends... The entire plan has been submitted to Chairman Chiang (the Chiang bandit Kai-shek) for approval and is named 'Catholic Commando.'" This shows that the Catholic reactionary armed forces were completely a tool manipulated by the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek.

	From the above extremely incomplete materials that have already been publicly published, we can clearly recognize that this group of scum in Catholicism in China in the past not only actively participated in anti-people political activities, but also organized reactionary armed forces to help American imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang slaughter the Chinese people. Their hands are stained with the blood of the people, but they want others to believe that Catholicism is "supra-political"!

　　天主教败类帮助美蒋匪帮进行反人民内战的例证
    林洪
    帝国主义分子及其走狗破坏天主教三自革新运动的方法之一，是硬说天主教“超国际”、“超政治”、“和帝国主义没有联系”；但事实上，天主教的某些败类，正是挑着这个“超政治”的破烂招牌，专门帮助美蒋匪帮进行反人民的勾当。我们从于斌所主持的天主教机关刊物《益世周刊》上，就可找到许多不打自招的证据。
            利用天主教建立反动组织，帮助蒋匪进行内战
    抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义的支持下发动了反共反人民的内战。天主教的败类就积极建立反动组织，帮助美国战争贩子和蒋介石匪帮残杀中国人民。《益世周刊》第二十九卷二十一期有个署名“让”的在《起来哉教胞乎》一文中，明目张胆地提出：天主教“应设法多造就政治人才，并积极参加政治活动，而组织天主教党——或公教党——已届其时矣。”参加什么样的政治活动呢？投靠帝国主义来反共反人民。该刊第三十卷三期供认，“中国宗教徒联谊会，为了发动全国各宗教徒一致参加戡乱救国（按：即蒋介石的反人民内战）工作起见，特派总干事卫立民赴各地督导。”蒋匪介石为了“嘉勉”该反动组织，特别“颁题该会‘兴教建国’匾额一方”。著名特务，比利时籍神父雷振远，也在华北五省组织了“民众建国协会”，积极从事间谍活动。
    天主教败类于斌之流更终日往来于蒋介石、陈诚、卫立煌、李宗仁的门下，为他们收罗特务、间谍和组织反动武装。例如该刊二十九卷三期所供认的，于斌“对挽救东北危机”（即是更残酷地屠杀东北人民），曾向蒋匪介石当面“贡献”几点意见，其中尤以“积极发动民众组织，充实地方武力，扩大绥靖总司令制度”一项建议，“大蒙”蒋匪介石“嘉纳”。但尽管于斌的建议为匪首蒋介石那样“嘉纳”，也终于没有挽救了国民党反动派的毁灭命运。
    一九四七年七月，当美国战争贩子魏德迈来中国帮助蒋匪介石策划进一步加强反人民内战的时候，于斌自称以“地方人士”的资格以供“咨询”，实际上就是向他的主子呈献卖国计谋。于斌因为震惊于当时东北人民力量的迅速壮大，曾当面请求魏德迈亲往东北一行，以便“作实地考察”，获得“足敷需要的资料”。于是魏德迈在他的“恳求”下，到东北去了一趟，使东北人民遭受了更大的痛苦。中国人民是不会忘记这笔血债的。
            为蒋匪帮争取“美援”，主张美国军事侵华
    于斌、毛振翔之流对于为蒋匪介石请求美国援助特别热心，甚至公开主张美国应以军事侵略中国。一九四七年底于斌在美国的两个多月，为了争取所谓美国援助，急急忙忙地四出演讲，先后叩见了杜鲁门、塔夫脱、杜威、葛里佛、周以德、蒲立特、鲁斯等战争贩子，苦苦地向他们哀求。当美国国会于一九四七年十一月通过以一千八百万美元送给蒋匪介石，作为继续杀害中国人民的资本时，于斌得意忘形，对美国反动的外交政策大加赞扬。于斌的有力帮凶之一、著名的美国特务、南京总主教区总经理毛振翔又于一九四八年初跑到美国，到处演讲，公开主张美国应以军事援助蒋匪介石。但因蒋匪帮所发动的内战是反人民的，尽管美帝国主义怎样“援助”也挽救不了失败的命运。
            组织反动武装，直接屠杀人民
    这一帮天主教败类，为了挽救蒋匪介石的独夫统治和帮助美国实现侵略中国的阴谋，不仅到处奔走，宣传反动思想，向蒋匪介石献“锦囊妙计”，积极呼吁美国援助，而且要组织所谓“反共十字军”，和人民作战，于是，这就进一步撕开了天主教“不参加政治活动”的伪装。钟国屏在《从圣诞节说到戡乱救国》一文中，即曾狂吠：“倡导教友应征杀匪（称中国人民为‘匪’，这里就露出了‘超政治’的本相），已是迫不容缓，教友组训军队，历史早有例证……空拳赤手，反共是不行的，所以面临大危机，非武装不成。”《益世周刊》中，接连登载了许多天主教反动武装活动的消息，如“河北××市公教武装组织，成绩极良好，已博得军事首长（指蒋匪军的匪首）极口称道。”又如“最近山东公教健儿亦已响应组织‘九九九’部队，由万凤程司铎任营指导，该队干部及主要长官系天主教友，……已将整个计划呈蒋主席（蒋匪介石）批准，定名‘公教别动队’。”这就说明天主教的反动武装，完全是匪首蒋介石操纵的工具。
    从上面这些已经公开发表过的极不完全的材料里，我们就可以清楚地认识到：天主教的这一帮败类过去在中国不但积极地参加了反人民的政治活动，而且还组织了反动武装，帮助美帝国主义和蒋匪帮屠杀中国人民。他们的双手沾满了人民的鲜血，却想要别人相信天主教是“超政治”的！
