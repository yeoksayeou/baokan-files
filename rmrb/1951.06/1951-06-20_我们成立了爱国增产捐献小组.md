　　We Established a Patriotic Increase Production Donation Group
　　Lin Wei, from the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing
　　After listening to the report from the delegation to Korea on May 31st, the comrades of the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing started a discussion that very day. By the afternoon of the next day, a quick report on the donation situation was quickly posted on the wall in front of the meeting room. Then, one quick report after another rapidly appeared on the wall. Two-thirds of the comrades posted their donation plans: some wanted to quit smoking, some were prepared to eat less well, and some planned to save all pocket money. Everyone was carefully calculating, trying to save a large amount of money from their existing contracted expenses to support the Volunteer Army.
　　After calculating, the money was still limited. Lowering food standards and saving necessary pocket money would affect physical health and reduce work efficiency. Therefore, everyone felt that they had to think of an active solution.
　　On June 2nd, the newspaper published the call of the China Peace Committee, which gave everyone great inspiration. The comrades of the Organization Department immediately proposed forming a patriotic increase production donation group, designating Sunday as "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Labor Day," directly participating in the production front, and donating all the wages earned to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.
　　That day, the first patriotic increase production donation group was established, with a total of five comrades: Fang Enbo, Li Gongtian, Shen Guowei, Ji Ruitian, and Lin Wei. That evening, they negotiated work with the Yongmao Electrical and Mechanical Factory. The next day was Sunday, and the five comrades of the first increase production donation group arrived at the factory just after six o'clock. The enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea and the slogan of increasing production to strike at American imperialism inspired everyone. In the first seventy-five minutes of work, they transported one hundred and twenty small carts. Everyone challenged each other and ran non-stop. In the morning, each person transported two carts at a time. In the afternoon, everyone improved their work methods based on the morning's experience. Comrade Ji Ruitian used iron wire to tie the carts together, and could pull seven at a time. Even Comrade Shen Guowei, who was relatively weak, could pull five carts each time. The work that should have taken two days was completed in less than a day. That day, the entire group of five full-time workers, according to the treatment of ordinary laborers, earned a total of 55,000 yuan. Everyone happily donated this first wage. After hearing this news, the comrades of the Transportation Detachment and the District Office all wanted to join this kind of patriotic increase production donation group. Some comrades of the District Committee have decided to go to production next time as well.
　　The comrades of the increase production donation group felt the joy of directly contributing to supporting the front lines from this labor. In the future, they plan to improve the organization of the group, establish a labor system, better connect with the factory, and fully utilize everyone's strength. Under the principle of not hindering work and necessary rest, they will often use this method to increase income and donate all of it to the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army.

### 我们成立了爱国增产捐献小组

　　我们成立了爱国增产捐献小组
    中共北京市第五区委员会　林苇
    中共北京市第五区委员会的同志们，在五月三十一日听了赴朝慰问团的报告，当天就展开了讨论。第二天下午，会议室前的墙上很快贴出了捐献情形的快报。接着，一张快报跟着一张快报迅速地出现在墙上。三分之二的同志们都贴出了自己的捐献计划：有的要戒烟，有的预备吃得坏一些，有的打算节省一切零用钱。人人都在精打细算，想从现有的包干费中节省出大量的钱，来支援志愿军。
    算来算去，钱都有限。降低伙食标准和节省必要的零用钱，都会影响身体健康，降低工作效率。因此，大家都觉得非想积极的办法不可。
    六月二日，报纸登出了抗美援朝总会的号召，大家得到了极大的启示。组织部的同志们马上提出成立爱国增产捐献小组，定星期日为“抗美援朝爱国劳动日”，直接参加生产战线，把所得到的工资，全部捐献出来，购买飞机、大炮支援志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    当天，第一个爱国增产捐献小组就成立了，全组共有方恩波、李公田、沈国威、冀瑞田、林苇等五个同志。当晚，就和永茂机电厂谈好了工作。第二天正是星期日，第一个增产捐献小组的五个同志在六点刚过就到了工厂。抗美援朝的热情和增产就是打击美帝国主义的口号，鼓舞着每一个人。刚开始工作的七十五分钟内，就运送了一百二十辆小车。大家互相挑战，不停地奔跑。上午，每人一次运两辆小车。下午，大家根据上午的经验，改进了工作方法。冀瑞田同志用铁丝把小车捆好，一次就能拉七辆，连身体比较弱的沈国威同志每次也能拉五辆。应该两天作的活，不到一天就完成了任务。那天，全组五个整工，按照一般小工的待遇，共得工资五万五千元。大家高高兴兴地捐献了这第一笔工资。交通分队和区公所的同志们听到这个消息后，都想参加这种爱国增产捐献小组。区委会的有些同志们，已经决定下次也一道去生产。
    增产捐献小组的同志们，从这次劳动中，感到了直接出力支援前线的愉快。以后，预备健全小组的组织，建立劳动制度，更好地与工厂联系，充分发挥大家的力量。在不妨碍工作和必要休息的原则下，经常用这种办法增加收入，全部捐献给志愿军和解放军。
