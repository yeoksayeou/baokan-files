　　堰口 damaged by rain should be checked and repaired as soon as possible Editor:
　　Last winter, we, in Huarong County, repaired a total of 7,771 large and small ponds and dams. This spring, there has been a lot of heavy rain, and about 30% of the 堰口 have been washed away or have developed leakage. Farmers are busy planting rice seedlings according to the season, and have temporarily relaxed the work of repairing 堰口 and 堰坡. Old farmers say that long rains are often followed by long sunny periods, especially in our mountainous areas, where there is often a minor drought every five days and a major drought every ten days. It has been sunny for eighteen days recently, and a drought is very likely. Therefore, we must quickly check and repair 堰口 and 堰坡.

　　被雨水冲毁的堰口应当赶快检查整修编辑同志：
    去年冬天，我们华容县共补修了大小塘坝七千七百七十一口。今年春天下雨很多、很大，约有百分之三十以上的堰口被冲毁，或发生了崩漏现象。农民赶季节插秧，暂时放松了修理堰口、堰坡的工作。老农民说，久雨常有久晴，尤其我们山地常常是五天一小旱，十天一大旱，最近已晴了十八天，闹天旱是很可能的。所以我们要赶快检查、整修堰口和堰坡。
