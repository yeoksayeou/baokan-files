Column: Newspaper Review

　　The "Party Life" section is an extremely important column in newspapers. Its main task is to elucidate inner-Party life and the Party's political work, to educate Communist Party members to engage in Bolshevik self-criticism, to raise the working level of Party organizations, and to realize the Party's political and organizational role among the masses.

　　In recent years, newspapers in various regions have made great efforts to strengthen the propaganda on Party life. Many newspapers have established the "Party Life" section, which has become a regular column in the newspaper. Party organizations in the old revolutionary base areas are more common, and there are more reports and commentaries on Party life in the newspapers. From March 1st to May 20th, the Hebei Daily's "Party Life" column published 50 articles, and the Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper (bi-weekly) published 32 articles. These articles conducted valuable discussions on many aspects of Party life and Party work, thus enriching the content of the newspapers.

　　However, even in the old liberated areas, there are still some important newspapers that have not paid attention to the propaganda on Party life. The Rehe Mass Daily, Tianjin Daily, Pingyuan Daily, and Suiyuan Daily have not had a "Party Life" column during the same period. It should be pointed out that these areas generally have the conditions to establish a "Party Life" column. Establishing this column and paying attention to publicizing the Party's work and Party building in the newspapers deserves the attention of these newspapers. In the newly liberated areas, only a few newspapers have opened a "Party Life" column. In these areas, it may be difficult for provincial-level newspapers to establish a "Party Life" column universally. Therefore, strengthening the propaganda of Party life in major administrative region newspapers has special significance. In this regard, the Liberation Daily and the Yangtze Daily have done some work. During the same period, the Liberation Daily published 51 articles on Party life, especially focusing on the issue of establishing a propaganda network. Unfortunately, some major administrative region newspapers have not fulfilled this task well. The Xi'an Mass Daily only published four articles in the "Party Life" column in eighty days, one of which was a reprint of a Pravda editorial translated from the People's Daily; the Chongqing Xinhua Daily also only had a few articles between March 1st and May 14th. This situation cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of Party members and non-Party activists.

　　The central issue in improving the "Party Life" column in newspapers across the country is to strengthen the ideological content. Among them, the first is the issue of praising model Party members in the "Party Life" column. Many newspapers have published such articles in the "Party Life" column, which has become a regular and major part of this column, but many articles do not reflect the high political standards of outstanding Communist Party members. For example, the Liberation Daily published an article on May 19th entitled "Shan Erhou, Who Gloriously Won the Red Flag," praising the model deeds of worker Party member Shan Erhou, who united all the workers in the group to actively produce and win the Red Flag. Comrade Shan Erhou's deeds are worth praising, and the article is generally vivid in describing her ability to follow the mass line in her work, but the author only said in the first section introducing Shan Erhou herself how bitter her past life was and how she has improved now, "Therefore, she can actively lead everyone in all her work. Because her political awareness has been raised quickly after her liberation, she gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in April 1950." It seems that what enlightened her political awareness was only the improvement of her life, and the description of the degree of political awareness was only limited to "deeply realizing that her liberation days were given to her by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Obviously, it is not enough to explain the high political standards of an outstanding Communist Party member in this way, which weakens the ideological nature of this article. Similar examples can be seen in many articles and should be noted.

　　A wealth of subjects have appeared in the "Party Life" columns of newspapers across the country, reflecting various problems in Party work. It is extremely meaningful to select important ones from these subjects and problems for discussion. In this regard, the Hebei Daily and the Nanjing Xinhua Daily have made valuable attempts. Consciously promoting this method can greatly improve the ideological nature of the "Party Life" column. For example, the Hebei Daily raised the issue of "attaching importance to the education of basic Party knowledge ideologically" in the "Party Life" column on April 4th. On the 16th of the same month, it published materials from the Qingyuan County Party Committee that found that many Party members in the rural areas were not clear about the basic knowledge of the Party during the test, and published a short commentary, requiring "strengthening the leadership of branch education work." Such a problem has a universal significance at present. Unfortunately, although the Hebei Daily has raised this issue well, it has not展开展开 the discussion and conduct continuous reporting in order to solve this problem. Similarly, the Shanxi Farmers' Daily published on April 30th a material of Party member Li Tianshun criticizing his retreatist thinking and determined to take practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This involves the ideological problem that is common among rural Party members. The editor called on everyone to discuss it, but no response has been seen in twenty days. In fact, if the newspaper conducts effective mass work and insists on this discussion to the end, "Party Life" can play a significant practical role in the ideological education of Party members.

　　"Party Life" is also a powerful weapon for carrying out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism of Party members and Party organizations. Some newspapers have already used this weapon. For example, the Yangtze Daily published a criticism on April 8th regarding the "CPC Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill General Branch Committee neglecting workers' ideological education," pointing out that they focused solely on production and management of production competitions, while neglecting propaganda and mobilization work, abandoning political and ideological leadership, thus limiting the ideological basis of the patriotic production competition among the workers to the level of "now working is not buried, striving for models, and having rewards," causing the work to stagnate. Later, on May 13th, the Yangtze Daily published the self-criticism and improvement methods of the No. 1 Cotton Mill General Branch. This phenomenon was common at the time and in the area. The criticism in the newspaper solved this problem, that is, realized its role of ideological leadership. It must be noted that if the newspaper has carried out criticism, it should strive to ensure the effectiveness of the criticism. On April 10th, the Yangtze Daily published a criticism in the "Party Life" column about the Wuchang County Sixth District Committee not paying attention to Party members' ideological education, but after forty days there was no result. This phenomenon must be overcome.

　　Since "Party Life" is often published publicly in newspapers, it will definitely have an educational effect on non-Party activists. Facts have proved that many non-Party activists are also readers of "Party Life" and have received a good education from it. Therefore, it is meaningful for newspaper editors to appropriately publish some non-Party activists' understanding and opinions on the Party. The Zhejiang Daily published on April 1st the feelings of a non-Party staff member of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance after participating in the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance branch meeting of the Communist Party of China, entitled "Under the Leadership of the Communist Party, I Can Be Considered a Real Person." The author used his own outlook on life, which was influenced by the reactionary and corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, and the spirit shown by Communist Party members in their actual work to make a meaningful comparison, raised his level of awareness, and reached the above conclusion, illustrating the Party's educational role for the masses. Publishing such materials is beneficial to both Party members and non-Party members.

　　To do the above work well, establish a regular "Party Life" column in the newspaper and strengthen the ideological nature of Party life propaganda, the key lies in selecting capable personnel to form a strong Party Life Group. The Party Life Group should be one of the most important departments of the editorial department. Its staff should not only have proficient business skills, but also be familiar with Party knowledge and often study the work of Party organizations. The "Party Life" column of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on March 26th discussed the issue of the punishment and Party membership of probationary Party members, and made an incorrect interpretation of the Party Constitution. Readers' letters pointed out this error, and the interpretation of the Southwest Bureau Discipline Inspection Commission was published on April 6th to solve this problem. This discussion not only shows the serious negligence of the newspaper's Party Life Group in handling manuscripts, but also points out to newspapers in various places the necessity of strengthening the Party Life Group.

### 关于报纸上的“党的生活”栏

专栏：报纸述评

　　关于报纸上的“党的生活”栏
    “党的生活”是报纸上的极重要的一栏，它的主要任务是阐明党内生活和党的政治工作，教育共产党员展开布尔维什克的自我批评，提高党组织的工作水平，实现党在群众中的政治的和组织的作用。
    各地报纸近年来在加强关于党的生活的宣传上已作了很大的努力，许多报纸已建立了“党的生活”，成为报纸上经常出现的专栏之一。老区党组织较为普遍，报纸上关于党的生活的报道和评述也比较多。从三月一日到五月二十日止，河北日报的“党的生活”栏发表了五十篇稿件，山东农村大众报（二日刊）发表了三十二篇稿件，这些文章对党内生活和党工作的许多方面进行了有价值的讨论，因而使报纸的内容丰富起来。
    但是，就是在老解放区中也还有若干重要的报纸没有注意关于党的生活的宣传，热河群众日报、天津日报、平原日报、绥远日报在同一时期中都没有出现过“党的生活”栏。应该指出，这些地区一般地都有条件建立“党的生活”栏，建立这一栏并注意在报纸上宣传党的工作和党的建设的问题，值得引起这些报纸的注意。在新解放区，报纸辟了“党的生活”栏的还是少数。在这些地区，省级的报纸普遍地建立“党的生活”栏可能是有困难的，因此，在大行政区报纸上加强党的生活的宣传便有了特别重要的意义。在这一方面，解放日报和长江日报都做了一些工作。解放日报在同一时期中，发表了五十一篇关于党的生活的稿件，特别着重地讨论了关于建立宣传网的问题。可惜有些大行政区的报纸还没有很好地负担这个任务。西安群众日报在八十天中“党的生活”栏只发表了四篇文章，其中之一还是转载自人民日报所翻译的真理报社论；重庆新华日报在三月一日至五月十四日之间，也只有几篇文章。这种情形是无法满足广大党员和非党积极分子的要求的。
    改进各地报纸上的“党的生活”栏的中心问题是加强内容的思想性。其中首先是“党的生活”栏对于模范党员的表扬问题。许多报纸在“党的生活”栏发表了这样的文章，成为这一栏的经常的主要内容之一，但是有许多文章并没有表现出优秀的共产党员的高度的政治标准。例如，五月十九日解放日报发表了《光荣得红旗的单二侯》一文，表扬工人党员单二侯团结全组工人积极生产争得红旗的模范事迹。单二侯同志的事迹是值得加以表扬的，这篇文章写她在工作中能走群众路线时也大体上是生动的，但作者在第一节介绍单二侯本人时，却只是说她过去生活怎样苦，现在获得了怎样的改善，“因此，她在一切工作中都能积极带领大家干。因为她翻身后的政治觉悟高，进步快，在一九五○年四月里，已光荣地参加了中国共产党。”似乎启发了她的政治觉悟的只是由于生活改善，而对政治觉悟程度的描写也只是限于“深深地体味到她的翻身日子，是共产党、毛主席给她的”。显然，以此来说明一个优秀的共产党员的高度的政治标准是不够的，这就削弱了这篇文章的思想性。类此的例子还可以在许多文章中看到，应当加以注意。
    在各地报纸的“党的生活”栏出现了丰富的题材，反映出党工作中的各种问题，在这些题材和问题中选择重要的加以讨论，是极有意义的。在这一方面，河北日报和南京新华日报都作了有价值的尝试，有意识地推广这种方法，也就可以大大地提高“党的生活”栏的思想性。例如河北日报四月四日在“党的生活”栏中提出了“从思想上重视党的基本知识教育”的问题，同月十六日发表了清苑县委在测验农村党员中发现很多党员闹不清党的基本知识的材料，并发表短评，要求“加强支部教育工作的领导”。这样的问题在目前是带有普遍意义的，可惜河北日报虽然很好地提出了这个问题，但还没有展开讨论和进行连续报道，以便解决这个问题。同样，山西农民报四月三十日发表了党员李天顺批判自己的退坡思想、决心拿实际行动抗美援朝的一项材料，这是涉及农村党员中带普遍性的思想问题，编者号召大家进行讨论，但在二十天中还没有看到反应。事实上，如果报纸进行了有效的群众工作，并坚持这种讨论，讨论到底，“党的生活”便可以在党员的思想教育上发挥重大的实际的作用。
    “党的生活”也是进行对党员和党组织的布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的有力武器。有些报纸已经使用了这个武器，例如长江日报在四月八日发表了关于“中共武昌第一纱厂总支委员会忽视工人思想教育”的批评，指出他们专门搞生产和管理生产竞赛，而忽略了宣传鼓动工作，放弃了政治思想领导，因而使爱国主义生产竞赛在工人群众中的思想基础只限于“现在干活不埋没、争模范、有奖励”的水平上，使工作停滞不前。此后在五月十三日发表了第一纱厂总支的检讨和改进办法。这种现象在当时当地曾是普遍的，报纸上的批评解决了这个问题，也就是实现了它的思想领导的作用。必须注意的是报纸进行了批评，就应当努力保证批评的有效性。四月十日长江日报在“党的生活”栏发表了关于武昌县第六区区委会不重视党员思想教育的批评，但是过了四十天还没有结果，这种现象必须加以克服。
    “党的生活”既然经常在报纸上公开发表，对非党积极分子一定会有教育作用。事实证明，许多非党积极分子也是“党的生活”的读者，并从它受到了很好的教育。因此，报纸的编辑适当地发表一些非党积极分子对党的认识和意见也是有意义的。浙江日报在四月一日发表过一个浙江省财政厅的非党工作人员参加中共浙江省财政厅支部大会之后的感想，题为《在共产党的领导下，我才算是真正做人》。作者用他自己的因国民党反动腐败统治影响而形成的人生观和共产党员在实际工作中表现出来的气概作了有意义的对比，提高了觉悟程度，得出上述的结论，说明了党对群众的教育作用。发表这样的材料，对于党员和非党员都是有益的。
    做好以上这些工作，建立报纸上的经常的“党的生活”栏并加强党的生活宣传的思想性，关键在于选择有能力的人员组成强有力的党的生活组。党的生活组应该是编辑部最主要的部门之一，它的工作人员不但要有熟练的业务能力，而且应该通晓党的知识，并经常研究党组织的工作。重庆新华日报三月二十六日“党的生活”栏讨论了关于对候补党员的处分和党籍问题，便对党章作了不正确的解释，读者来信指出了这个错误，四月六日发表了西南局纪律检查委员会的解释，才解决了这个问题。这个讨论不仅表示该报党的生活组在处理稿件中的严重的疏忽，也向各地报纸指出了有加强党的生活组的必要。
