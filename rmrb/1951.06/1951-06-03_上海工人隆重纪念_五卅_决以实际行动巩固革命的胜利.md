　　Shanghai Workers Solemnly Commemorate the "May Thirtieth"
    Incident, Resolving to Consolidate the Victory of the Revolution with Practical Actions

　　Shanghai workers solemnly commemorated the 26th anniversary of the "May Thirtieth" Movement on the 30th. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions invited eighty-eight veteran workers who participated in the "May Thirtieth" struggle to hold a discussion. At the meeting, Dai Jinlin and Cai Tingfu, former worker pickets during the "May Thirtieth" Incident and veteran workers from the British & Engineering Shipbuilding Factory, recounted the arduous struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionaries in the past, as well as the painful conditions of workers' lives, and compared them with today's price stability and implementation of labor insurance. They unanimously expressed: we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries and do a good job in production to consolidate the victory of the revolution. At the site where martyr Gu Zhenghong was killed in the Putuo District of Shanghai, within the State-owned Third Cotton Textile Factory (formerly Neiwaimian No. 7 Factory), over eight hundred worker representatives from the entire district held a solemn commemoration meeting. Four veteran workers who participated in the "May Thirtieth" struggle and witnessed the glorious sacrifice of martyr Gu Zhenghong, denounced the crimes of Wu Wanzhang, one of the imperialist running dogs and murderers who slaughtered the masses participating in the "May Thirtieth" Movement, who has been arrested by the People's Government. Gu Rufang, the uncle of martyr Gu Zhenghong, said in his denunciation: "Since the 'May Thirtieth' Incident, the goals of the struggle for which Zhenghong and many other martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves have now been realized step by step. We must continue to resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism and strive to build a strong and prosperous New China!" Residents of the Tokyo Lane area in Putuo District and factories such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company also held commemoration meetings to avenge the martyrs.

    On the same day, the Shanghai Liberation Daily and Ta Kung Pao both published editorials commemorating the "May Thirtieth" Incident. The Liberation Daily editorial exposed that American imperialism had sent thirteen warships at the time, and a large number of U.S. Marines landed to participate in the massacre of the Chinese people. Both newspapers' editorials called on the people of Shanghai to thoroughly carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements in order to consolidate the fruits of the people's victory.

　　上海工人隆重纪念“五卅”
    决以实际行动巩固革命的胜利
    上海市工人于三十日隆重纪念“五卅”运动二十六周年。上海市总工会邀请了八十八位参加过“五卅”斗争的老工人，举行座谈会。会上，“五卅”时的工人纠察队员、英联船厂老工人戴金林、蔡廷富等在发言中，叙述了过去对帝国主义和国内反动派的艰苦斗争、以及工人生活的痛苦情形，并和今天的物价稳定、实行劳动保险等作了对比。他们一致表示：要坚决镇压反革命，搞好生产，来巩固革命胜利。在沪西普陀区顾正红烈士就义地点，国营第三棉纺织厂（原内外棉七厂）厂内，全区八百余工人代表举行了庄严的纪念大会。曾参加“五卅”斗争、并目击顾正红烈士光荣牺牲的四位老工人，在会上控诉了已被人民政府逮捕的帝国主义走狗、曾屠杀参加“五卅”运动的群众的凶犯之一吴匪万章的罪行。顾正红烈士的叔祖父顾汝舫，在控诉中说：“‘五卅’以来，正红及许多先烈流血牺牲的斗争目标，现在已经一步一步实现了。我们还要继续坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，为建设富强、繁荣的新中国而斗争！”普陀区东京里一带的里弄居民及上海电力公司等厂，也举行了为烈士复仇的纪念大会。
    同日，上海解放日报、大公报均发表了纪念“五卅”的社论。解放日报社论揭发了美帝国主义当时曾开来十三艘军舰，美国海军陆战队大批登陆，参加屠杀中国人民。两报的社论均号召上海人民必须深入展开抗美援朝运动，严厉镇压反革命分子，以巩固人民的胜利果实。（新华社）
