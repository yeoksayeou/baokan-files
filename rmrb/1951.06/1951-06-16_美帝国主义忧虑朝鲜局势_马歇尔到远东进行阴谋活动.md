Xinhua News Agency, 15th: With the Korean War facing increasingly difficult circumstances, U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall arrived in Korea on the morning of the 8th after passing through Japan. He immediately held talks with Ridgway and Van Fleet, and convened a "secret meeting" of commanders of the U.S. and accomplice countries' armies. After returning to Tokyo, he held multiple talks with Ridgway and also met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida. After three and a half days of activities, Marshall returned to Washington on the 12th.

Marshall's activities in the Far East indicate the anxiety of U.S. imperialism about the situation in Korea and the Far East. In the past year, the United States has already lost the elite of its army in Korea; moreover, under the skillful attacks of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, losses are increasing, while the number of people enlisting in the U.S. has greatly decreased. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 12th, the number of enlistments in the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, which previously relied on volunteers, has greatly decreased. The Air Force "may soon have to draft." However, the number of American youths evading military service is increasing. Therefore, how to replenish the casualties on the Korean front, especially the replenishment of technical personnel and officers, has become a serious problem for the American aggressors. When Marshall entertained reporters in Tokyo on the 11th, he had to admit that the U.S. Department of Defense was most troubled by the replenishment of these "expert soldiers" and officers. He said: "I came here to see for myself some of these particular difficulties."

At the same time, the Korean War has made America's financial difficulties increasingly serious. According to a Paris dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 8th, people close to Truman said: "The current U.S. defense budget is $60 billion a year, but this does not include the cost of the Korean War." And "the Korean War budget requires $10 billion or $15 billion, or even $20 billion." This huge expenditure is difficult for the U.S. treasury to bear.

The news indicates that Marshall's trip to Korea only revealed more difficulties, but did not find any way to solve the difficulties.

### 美帝国主义忧虑朝鲜局势  马歇尔到远东进行阴谋活动

　　美帝国主义忧虑朝鲜局势        
    马歇尔到远东进行阴谋活动
    【新华社十五日讯】在侵朝战争面临愈来愈困难的情况下，美国国防部长马歇尔于八日晨经日本赶抵朝鲜，立即和李奇微、范佛里特举行会谈，并召集了美国和帮凶国家军队的长官举行“秘密会议”。他在回到东京后，又与李奇微进行了多次会谈，并和日本首相吉田会谈。马歇尔在经过三天半的活动后，已于十二日返抵华盛顿。
    马歇尔此次到远东活动，表示了美国帝国主义对朝鲜和远东局势的忧虑。一年来，美国已经在朝鲜丧失了它陆军中的精锐部分；而且在朝、中人民军队的机敏打击下，损失正愈来愈大，而美国国内参军的人数则大为减少。据美联社华盛顿十二日电透露，过去依靠志愿参军人员补充的美国空军、海军和海军陆战队，参军人数大为减少。空军“不久可能必须征兵”。但是，美国青年们逃避兵役者又正日益增多。因此，如何补充在朝鲜前线的伤亡，特别是技术人员和军官的补充问题，就不能不成为美国侵略者的一个严重问题。马歇尔十一日在东京招待记者时，不得不承认：美国防部感到最伤脑筋的就是这种“专家士兵”和军官的补充问题。他说：“我到这里来，就是想亲自看看若干这种特殊的困难。”
    同时，侵朝战争使美国财政困难日益严重。据法新社华盛顿八日电，接近杜鲁门的人士说：“美国国防预算目前达每年六百亿美元，但并未包括朝鲜战费在内。”而“朝鲜战争预算就需一百亿美元或一百五十亿美元，甚至需要二百亿美元。”这个庞大的支出，势为美国财政所难于负担。
    消息表示：马歇尔的朝鲜之行，只是发现了更多的困难，却没有发现解决困难问题的任何办法。
