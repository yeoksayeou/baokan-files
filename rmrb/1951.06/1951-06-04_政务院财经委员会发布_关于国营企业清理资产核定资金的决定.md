The national state-owned enterprises have undergone preliminary registration of their assets after takeover, industrial census, and warehouse clearance. However, with the exception of the Northeast, the own funds of various enterprises have generally not been formally verified, resulting in many enterprise units still maintaining a supply-based style of operation to a greater or lesser extent. In order to determine the state investment in enterprise funds for state-owned enterprises and to establish a foundation for economic accounting, the following decisions are made:

(1) All national state-owned enterprises, including industry (including salt industry and wine making), railways, transportation (including postal and telecommunications), trade, banks, agriculture and forestry (including fisheries and animal husbandry), water conservancy, and all other central and greater administrative region-operated enterprises, shall re-clear, register, evaluate, and verify their actual fixed assets and working capital.

(2) Organize asset clearing and capital verification committees for state-owned enterprises at all levels (hereinafter referred to as the "Verification Committee"), with the deputy director of the financial committee or head of the department at each level serving as the director, and absorb relevant agency supervisors as members, and allocate or designate dedicated personnel for office work. The organizational methods are as follows:

	A. Under the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, a National Verification Committee is established to manage the clearing of assets and the final verification of funds for national state-owned enterprises.

	B. Under the Financial and Economic Committees of the Greater Administrative Regions and their district-administered departments (companies), Greater Administrative Region Verification Committees are established at all levels to be responsible for the clearing of assets and the verification of funds of state-owned enterprises entrusted by the central government to be managed on its behalf, and to manage the clearing of assets and the verification of funds of state-owned enterprises operated by the Greater Administrative Regions themselves.

	C. The central financial and economic departments that directly manage state-owned enterprises shall establish departmental Verification Committees to be responsible for the clearing of assets and the verification of funds of enterprises directly controlled by the departments, and to be responsible for the verification of funds of state-owned enterprises managed on behalf of the Greater Administrative Regions and provinces and cities.

	D. Provinces and cities directly entrusted by the central government to manage state-owned enterprises on its behalf shall establish provincial and municipal Verification Committees to be responsible for the clearing of assets and the verification of funds of state-owned enterprises managed on behalf of the provinces and cities.

	E. Each grassroots unit of state-owned enterprises shall organize a unit Verification Committee, or use existing organizations (such as factory management committees) to carry out this work.

The National Verification Committee is responsible for formulating and approving various methods and forms for clearing assets and verifying funds (to be promulgated separately), and leading the Verification Committees at all levels. The Greater Administrative Region Verification Committees may, for state-owned enterprises within their jurisdiction, separately designate personnel from the provincial and municipal financial committees to supervise and guide the verification of funds, and report their work to the Greater Administrative Region Verification Committee.

(3) The fixed assets and working capital of national state-owned enterprises shall be re-cleared and registered, and re-evaluated at the RMB price at the end of June 1951. If, as of the end of June 1951, the quantity of all assets is correct, and the original book value and evaluation standards are indeed in line with the principles of the asset evaluation methods promulgated by the National Verification Committee, it is only necessary to conduct a review and correction, re-register according to the prescribed forms, create a register and submit it to the Verification Committees at all levels for review and compilation, and report it level by level to the National Verification Committee. If the quantity of assets is still incorrect, it should be re-counted and reorganized. If the original book value and evaluation standards are largely or partly inconsistent with the principles of the evaluation methods, all or part of the assets should be re-evaluated and adjusted immediately.

(4) The working capital that national state-owned enterprises should own shall be verified in accordance with the production tasks assigned by the state in 1951, in order to complete the state plan with the least amount of materials and monetary funds.

The fixed assets that state-owned enterprises should retain shall be reviewed and verified level by level by the Verification Committees at all levels, and compiled according to the prescribed forms, and reported level by level to the National Verification Committee.

Under the condition of ensuring the completion of the production plan, the working capital of state-owned enterprises should accurately formulate the normal turnover quota funds and turnover rate, and the minimum necessary amount of own working capital, for each process of production and marketing, together with the balance sheet, and submit it to the competent Verification Committee, which shall be responsible for reviewing, compiling, and signing comments level by level, and reporting it to the National Verification Committee for final verification of the state-invested enterprise working capital.

(5) For the work of clearing assets and verifying funds of national state-owned enterprises, before the end of June, all departments from the central government to grassroots enterprises shall make good preparations for ideological, organizational, and preparatory work for clearing, evaluating, and verifying regulations, systems, and forms. Starting from July 1st, the work of clearing, evaluating, and verifying will be fully launched. This work shall be completed in full by the end of December this year at the latest, and the accounting work shall be carried out separately by the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government. A summary report shall be submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council before the end of January 1952.

　　政务院财经委员会发布
    关于国营企业清理资产核定资金的决定
    全国国营企业经过接管、工业普查、清理仓库之后，其资产已有初步登记。但除东北外，各企业的自有资金，一般均未正式核定，以致很多企业单位的经营管理工作，仍保持着或多或少的供给制作风。兹为确定国营企业的国家投资的企业资金，以建立经济核算制的基础，特作如下决定：
    （一）全国国营企业，包括工业（盐业制酒在内）、铁路、交通（邮电在内）、贸易、银行、农林（渔牧在内）、水利等所有中央及大行政区经营的企业，均应将实有一切固定资产与流动资产重行清理、登记、估价并核定其企业资金。
    （二）组织各级国营企业清理资产核定资金委员会（以下简称核资委员会），以各级财委副主任或部门首长兼主任，吸收有关机构主管人员为委员，并调配或指定专人办公。其组织办法如下：
    甲、在政务院财政经济委员会之下，成立全国核资委员会，掌管全国国营企业资产的清理及资金最后核定事项。
    乙、在大行政区财政经济委员会之下，及其区辖各部门（公司），成立大行政区各级核资委员会，负大行政区受中央委托代管的国营企业资产清理和资金审核之责，并掌管大行政区自营的国营企业资产清理及资金核定事项。
    丙、直接管理国营企业的中央财经各部门，成立部门的核资委员会，负部门直接掌握企业的资产清理及资金审核之责，并负大行政区及省市代管的国营企业资金审核之责。
    丁、中央直接委托代管国营企业的各省市，成立省市核资委员会，负省市代管国营企业资产清理和资金审核之责。
    戊、国营企业的各个基层单位，组织单位核资委员会，或使用现有组织（如工厂管理委员会），进行此项工作。
    全国核资委员会，负责制定和审定清理资产核定资金的各种办法及表格（另行颁布），并领导各级核资委员会。大行政区核资委员会，对于辖区内的国营企业，得分别指派省市财委人员进行核定资金的监督指导工作，并向大区核资委员会作工作报告。
    （三）全国国营企业的固定资产与流动资金，应一律重行清理登记，并按一九五一年六月底的人民币价格，重行估价。凡截至一九五一年六月底止，其全部资产数量已经正确，而原账面价值及估价标准，又确与全国核资委员会公布之资产估价办法原则相符合者，只须进行复查校正，按规定表格重行登记，造册送由各级核资委员会审核汇编，层报全国核资委员会。如资产数量仍不正确，则应重行清点整理。如原账面价值及估价标准大部或一部与估价办法原则不符者，其全部或一部资产，应即重行估价，予以调整。
    （四）全国国营企业应自有的流动资金，一律根据一九五一年国家所给予的生产任务来核定，以达用最少的物资与货币资金来完成国家计划的任务。
    国营企业应保有的固定资产，由各级核资委员会逐级审查核定，按规定表报加以汇编后，层报全国核资委员会。
    国营企业的流动资金，应在保证生产计划完成的条件下，按其生产与供销各过程，确切拟具正常周转定额资金和周转率，及最低必需的自有流动资金额，连同资产负债表，送主管核资委员会，逐级负责审核汇编并签注意见，报由全国核资委员会最后核定其国家投资的企业流动资金。
    （五）全国国营企业清理资产核定资金的工作，限六月底前，从中央各部到基层企业，一律作好思想的准备，组织的准备，及清查、估价、核定等章则、制度、表式的准备。从七月一日开始，全面展开清查、估价、核定的工作。此项工作，最迟限本年十二月底全部完成，并分别由中央财政部进行登账工作。一九五二年一月底前总结报告政务院财政经济委员会。
