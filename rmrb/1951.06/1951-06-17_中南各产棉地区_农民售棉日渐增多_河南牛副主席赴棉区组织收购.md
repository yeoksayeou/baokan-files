    In the central and southern cotton-producing regions, farmers are increasingly selling cotton. Vice Chairman Niu of Henan goes to cotton areas to organize purchases.

    The cotton purchasing and storage work in the Central and Southern region is underway. The CCP committees and people's governments of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces have successively issued instructions to their subordinates, specifically deploying the cotton purchasing work. On the 7th and 8th, Niu Peicong, Vice Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, Li Yousan, Director of the Department of Commerce, and Liu Jintang, Manager of the state-owned Henan Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, went to various cotton-producing areas to personally organize the cotton purchasing work. The CCP Shanzhou Prefectural Committee in the Henan cotton-producing area held a special meeting on cotton purchasing and storage, and selected cadres to form a working group to lead the cotton purchasing work in the Daying District of Shan County. In the central and southern cotton-producing areas, cotton farmers have gradually increased their sales of stored cotton in recent days. Employees of the Zao Yang branch of the state-owned Hubei Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company launched a "movement to mobilize relatives and friends to sell cotton." Employees whose families are in cotton-producing areas or who know that relatives and friends have cotton wrote letters to persuade them to sell their stored cotton, with good results. After hearing the reports of the CCP District Committee Secretary and District Head of the Shadaoguan District, and receiving a letter from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company urging sales, the Chairman of the Mituosi Township Farmers' Association convened a meeting overnight to mobilize farmers to sell cotton. After understanding that selling cotton to the state is a patriotic action to resist America and aid Korea, members of the Lianhua Township Cooperative immediately sold twelve dan of cotton.

    The Finance Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government has decided to offset a portion of the summer grain tax with cotton. This method has already been implemented in some places, such as Linru County, where more than 3,000 catties can be collected daily. The Financial and Economic Committees of the Henan, Hubei, and Hunan Provincial People's Governments have also urged government agencies and public enterprises to hand over their stored cotton to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company on the spot. The Fancheng branch of the state-owned Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has received nearly 7,000 dan of cotton from the Xiangyang Prefectural Finance Surcharge and the local People's Bank and troops. The state-owned Hubei Tianmen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company has received 1,000 dan of financial surcharge cotton. The stored cotton of trade companies in Anxiang and other counties in Hunan has also been sold to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company.

    On June 5, cotton merchants in Lingbao County, a cotton-producing area in Henan, sold all of their 10,963 dan of stored cotton to the Shanzhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and expressed their continued assistance to the government in vigorously purchasing cotton. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　中南各产棉地区        
    农民售棉日渐增多        
    河南牛副主席赴棉区组织收购
    中南区购棉、储棉工作正在开展中。河南、湖北、湖南三省中共党委和人民政府都先后向所属发出指示，具体布置了购棉工作。七、八两日，河南省人民政府副主席牛佩琮和商业厅厅长李友三、国营河南省花纱布公司经理刘锦堂等已分赴各产棉区亲自组织购棉工作。河南产棉区的中共陕州地委召开了购棉、储棉的专门会议，并抽调干部组成工作组到陕县大营区领导购棉工作。中南区各产棉区棉农出售存棉的近日来逐渐增多。国营湖北花纱布公司枣阳支公司职工展开了“动员亲友售棉运动”。家在产棉区或知道亲友有棉花的职工，分头写信劝售存棉，收效良好。沙道观区弥陀寺乡农会主席听了该区中共区委书记和区长的报告，又接到花纱布公司的劝售信后，连夜开会动员农民卖棉花。莲花乡合作社社员们懂得了把棉花卖给国家就是抗美援朝的爱国行动的道理后，马上卖出十二担棉花。
    河南省人民政府财政厅决定在粮田夏征中折征一部分棉花。这个办法已在有的地方开始实行，如临汝县每天可收三千多斤。河南、湖北、湖南三省人民政府财政经济委员会并已督促政府机关和公营企业就地把存棉交给花纱布公司。国营湖北省花纱布公司樊城支公司已收到襄阳专署财政附加棉及当地人民银行和部队存棉近七千担。国营湖北天门花纱布分公司已收进财政附加棉一千担。湖南安乡等县贸易公司的存棉也已卖给花纱布公司。
    河南产棉区灵宝县棉商于六月五日把全部存棉一万零九百六十三担卖给陕州花纱布公司，并表示继续协助政府大力收购。（新华社）
