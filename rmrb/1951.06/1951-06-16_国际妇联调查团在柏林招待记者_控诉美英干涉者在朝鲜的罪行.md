Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 15th: The members of the International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on atrocities committed by the US military in Korea, after returning from Korea, held a press conference here on the 12th. Representatives of the entire German press and many foreign journalists attended the press conference.

Mrs. Romeder, the head of the investigation team, stated at the press conference that the team members had reached the following conclusions from their observations in Korea: The American interventionists are systematically and inhumanely exterminating the Korean people. This is a grave violation of humanitarian principles and international legal standards stipulated in the Hague and Geneva Conventions regarding warfare.

The US and British interventionists are systematically destroying food, factories, farmland, and peaceful towns in Korea, and are using the most brutal weapons of murder, such as highly destructive napalm bombs, against unarmed women and children. In the Korean territories temporarily occupied by the US and British forces, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have been brutally executed without trial.

The statement said: The responsibility for these crimes against the Korean people should be borne by MacArthur, Ridgway, and the governments of those countries that agreed to the Korean War. The investigation team believes that all those proven to have committed crimes in Korea should be denounced as war criminals and punished in accordance with the provisions of the 1943 Allied Declaration.

The International Democratic Women's Investigation Team calls on people of all nations around the world to do everything possible to end the Korean War and withdraw the interventionist forces from Korea.

On behalf of the entire investigation team, Mrs. Romeder called on people all over the world to immediately organize aid to the Korean people, who are suffering severely from the atrocities of the US and British interventionists.

The investigation team members requested the Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation to send their investigation report on the atrocities of the US and British interventionists in Korea to the United Nations, governments of all countries, the World Peace Council, all women's public organizations, other peace-loving organizations, and world-renowned social figures.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 15th: London dispatch: Mrs. Felton, the British representative who participated in the International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on atrocities committed by the US military in Korea, exposed the atrocities of the US aggressor troops in Korea to the British people.

On June 8th, Mrs. Felton held a press conference in London. Felton said that she went to Korea without any prejudice. In Korea, she obtained a great deal of evidence proving the atrocities committed by the US military and the Syngman Rhee faction. She obtained authentic evidence proving that the US military shot prisoners of war without trial and instigated the burning of prisoners of war.

The delegation inspected the mass graves of those who had sacrificed themselves under this atrocity. Felton was greatly shocked by the traces of those barbaric atrocities. She had seen in books and newspapers that the Nazis committed such atrocities in the Second World War, but never expected that the US military would do the same.

The British *Daily Worker* published an editorial on Mrs. Felton's remarks, saying: "The British people are being corrupted by their government's participation in this bestial war. If they cherish their reputation, if they cherish the lives of their sons, they should force the government to withdraw all British troops from Korea." The newspaper published a photograph of a large cemetery near Sinchon when it published Mrs. Felton's remarks.

On June 11th, Mrs. Felton reported at the meeting of the International Women's Day Committee the terrible devastation caused by American aircraft bombing Korean cities. American planes indiscriminately strafed people on the streets and in the fields, and American troops systematically massacred men, women, and children. The audience frequently roared with anger during Felton's speech. Many women attending the meeting shed tears.

Felton said: Tears and anger are not enough – the British people must take action to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Korea. She said: "We should be determined to stop this war as soon as possible and help the Korean people rebuild their country."

Other speakers at the meeting expressed outrage that British newspapers did not report the true situation in Korea. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the BBC to allow Felton to speak to the British people.

One person at the meeting advocated that the interventionist leaders responsible for the atrocities should be tried as war criminals.

　　国际妇联调查团在柏林招待记者        
    控诉美英干涉者在朝鲜的罪行
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团团员由朝鲜回来后，于十二日在此间举行记者招待会。出席记者招待会的有整个德国新闻界的代表和许多外国记者。
    调查团团长罗德夫人在记者招待会上发表声明说，调查团团员从她们在朝鲜的观察中得到下列结论：美国干涉者正在有计划地惨无人道地消灭朝鲜人民。这是大大地违反人道原则以及海牙和日内瓦关于战争的国际公约中所规定的国际法标准的。
    美、英干涉者正在有计划地破坏粮食、工厂、耕地以及朝鲜的和平城镇，并使用最残酷的杀人武器如破坏性很高的凝固汽油弹，对付赤手的妇孺。美、英军队在暂时占领的朝鲜领土内，不经审问，就残酷地处决了数十万无辜平民。
    声明说：对朝鲜人民所犯的这些罪行的责任应该由麦克阿瑟、李奇微和那些同意朝鲜战争的国家的政府担负。调查团认为：一切证明在朝鲜犯了罪的人都应该按照一九四三年盟国宣言的规定，被斥为战犯并受到惩处。
    国际民主妇女调查团号召全世界各族人民尽力争取终止朝鲜战争，并从朝鲜撤退干涉者的军队。
    罗德夫人代表调查团全体团员号召全世界人民立即组织对朝鲜人民的援助，他们正受到美、英干涉者暴行的严重蹂躏。
    调查团团员要求国际民主妇联书记处，把她们关于美、英干涉者在朝鲜的暴行的调查报告送致联合国、各国政府、世界和平理事会、一切妇女公共组织和其他拥护和平的组织以及世界闻名的社会人士。
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】伦敦消息：参加国际民主妇女联合会所组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团的英国代表费尔顿夫人，向英国人民揭露美国侵略军在朝鲜的暴行。
    六月八日，费尔顿夫人在伦敦举行记者招待会。费尔顿说，她是毫无偏见地前往朝鲜的。在朝鲜，她得到了大量证据，证明美军和李承晚分子所犯的暴行。她得到了真实的证据，证明美军不经过审判就枪杀战俘，并且主使烧死战俘。
    代表团考察了在这种暴行下牺牲的人们的集体坟墓。费尔顿看到那些野蛮暴行的痕迹大为震惊。她曾经在书报上看到，纳粹在第二次世界大战中做出这样的暴行，但从未料想到美军也会做同样的事情。
    英国《工人日报》就费尔顿夫人的谈话发表社论说：“英国人民由于他们政府的参与这个禽兽般的战争而正被弄得堕落下去。如果他们珍惜自己的声誉，如果他们爱惜自己儿子的生命，他们应该迫使政府从朝鲜撤退全部英国军队。”该报在发表费尔顿夫人的谈话时，并登载了信川附近一座大坟场的照片。
    六月十一日，费尔顿夫人又在国际妇女节委员会的会议上报告了美国飞机的轰炸对朝鲜城市所造成的可怕破坏的情形。美国飞机滥肆扫射街道上和田野中的人民，美国军队有组织地残杀男女老幼。听众在费尔顿发言时频频发出愤怒的吼声。参加会议的许多妇女都落了泪。
    费尔顿说：眼泪和愤怒是不够的——英国人民必须采取行动要求英国军队从朝鲜撤退。她说：“我们应当下定决心赶快制止这个战争，并帮助朝鲜人民重新建设他们的国家。”
    其他在会上发言的人对英国报纸不报道朝鲜的真实情况，极表愤慨。会议通过决议，要求英国广播公司允许费尔顿向英国人民发表演说。
    会上有一个人主张把应对暴行负责的干涉军领袖当做战争罪犯审讯。
