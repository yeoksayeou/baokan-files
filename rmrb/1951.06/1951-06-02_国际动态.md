　　The Bolshoi Theatre's Anniversary
    The Soviet people celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet State Bolshoi Theatre on May 28th. A grand celebration was held at the Bolshoi Theatre in the evening. Guests from home and abroad gathered together. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also awarded orders and medals to 664 actors and staff of this oldest Russian opera house, in recognition of the theater's outstanding achievements in the development of Soviet musical drama.
            Professors Work as Waiters and Vendors
    The unemployment of intellectuals in West Germany is serious. There are 5,000 young doctors without jobs. The Hamburg newspaper "Die Welt" published an article entitled "Professors Work as Waiters and Vendors." It wrote: Hundreds of professors, associate professors, and assistant teachers cannot obtain their professions and are therefore forced to work as waiters, stenographers, proofreaders, etc.
    The American occupiers are the masterminds of this unemployment, and they are also preparing to give the unemployed a new profession—to be cannon fodder for American imperialism.
            Protagonists and Supporting Roles
    The British Actors' Association held its annual meeting on May 27. It was mentioned at the meeting that the British film industry is facing a serious threat due to the increasing dominance of the United States, and the number of unemployed film workers is increasing day by day. Famous film actor Dennison pointed out: In American-funded films produced in British studios, the protagonists are all played by American actors, and the British only play supporting roles.
    In the eyes of Americans, the British are only worthy of playing a second-rate role in any aspect.

            苏联大剧院的寿辰
    苏联人民于五月二十八日庆祝苏联国立大剧院成立一百七十五周年纪念日。晚上在大剧院举行了盛大庆祝会。国内外嘉宾济济一堂。苏联最高苏维埃主席团并以勋章及奖章授予这个资格最老的俄罗斯歌剧院的演员与职员六百六十四人，以表扬该剧院在苏联音乐戏剧艺术发展方面卓越的功绩。
            教授充当侍者与小贩
    西德知识分子失业现象严重。青年医师就有五千人没有职业。汉堡的《世界报》发表一篇文章，题目是《教授充当侍者与小贩》。里面写道：数百名教授、副教授和助教不能获得他们的职业，因而被迫充当侍者、速记员、校对员等。
    美国占领者是这种失业现象的监制人，他们还准备给予失业者一种新的职业——为美国帝国主义当炮灰。
            主角和配角
    英国演员协会于五月二十七日举行年会，会上有人提出英国影片业因为美国日益增强的支配而面临严重的威胁，失业的电影工作者一天天增多。著名电影演员邓尼逊指出：在英国制片厂摄制的美国资助的影片中，主角都是由美国演员担任，英国人只是担任配角。
    在美国人的眼里，不管在那一方面，英国人也只配当个二等角色。
