　　Celebrating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Party
         Rao Shushi
    July 1, 1951, is the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
    Our Party, from its establishment, was founded on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory, as the political party of the Chinese working class, and as the vanguard of the Chinese national liberation and the Chinese people's liberation.
    For the past thirty years, our Party has led the Chinese people through arduous, magnificent and tortuous revolutionary struggles, and finally won a great victory of historical significance, becoming the creator and leader of the great People's Republic of China.
    As our Party commemorates its thirtieth anniversary, all the Chinese people, with justified pride, recall our glorious past and look forward to our great future.
    Shanghai is the fortress of international imperialism's aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people for nearly a century, and the base of the Kuomintang's rule and exploitation of the Chinese people for more than twenty years. At the same time, it is also the city with the most concentrated working class in the country, and the birthplace of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, the people of Shanghai and East China now feel particularly excited and gratified to be able to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Communist Party of China in an environment of glorious victory over imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    After imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's remnant forces, were driven out of mainland China, the people of East China, like the people all over the country, are restoring and developing our domestic economic life with unparalleled enthusiasm and selfless spirit; and are opposing the shameful aggression of US imperialism against Korea and Taiwan with unparalleled anger and hatred.
    East China has generally achieved results in managing cities and taking over factories, mines, and enterprises. We have also achieved results in implementing the central government's instructions to unify national finance and economy, ensure tax revenue, stabilize prices, and rely on the working class to unite the urban people to defeat the enemy's blockade and bombing, and maintain and restore industrial production. Under the conditions of enemy blockade and raw material shortages, the recovery of industrial production is relatively fast. Taking the textile industry in East China, which accounts for more than 70% of the country, as an example, more than 90% of state-owned textile industries have started operations, and about 80% of private textile industries have also started operations. The workers' enthusiasm for production has been generally improved, the patriotic labor emulation movement is being universally launched, and the production of yarn and cloth has exceeded the level before liberation.
    East China has nearly 100 million agricultural population areas that have completed land reform. Areas that have completed land reform account for 85% of the total agricultural population in East China, and the remaining 15% of areas that have not yet carried out land reform will be fully completed by the end of this year. In areas where land reform has been completed, more than 60 million landless and land-poor peasants have been distributed land, agricultural tools, food and houses confiscated from landlords. There, the landlord class, the main supporter of domestic and foreign enemies, has been eliminated, the local tyrants and illegal landlords who resisted land reform have been punished, and other landlords are undergoing labor reform. Due to land reform and the strong support for production by the People's Government, the enthusiasm of farmers in East China has been unprecedentedly improved. It is estimated that in 1950, grain production in East China increased by 27.1% compared with 1949 (the first year of liberation), cotton production exceeded 1949 by 112.3%, industrial hemp production exceeded 1949 by 37.9%, and silk production exceeded 1949 by 30.2%. This year (1951), the area for planting industrial raw materials in East China has greatly exceeded last year (1950). The area planted with cotton exceeded 45%, the area planted with flue-cured tobacco exceeded four times, and the area planted with industrial hemp exceeded three and a half times. Due to the large-scale production of industrial raw materials and the continuous improvement of farmers' production and living standards, not only has a solid foundation been created for the recovery and development of industry, but also the solid alliance between the working class and the peasants has been greatly strengthened.
    Due to the corruption of the past Kuomintang reactionary rule and the long-term neglect of water conservancy, China has suffered from years of natural disasters. Last year alone, due to the flooding of the Huai River in the Huaibei area of ​​East China, 31.62 million mu of land were flooded, and there were nearly 10 million disaster victims. Since Chairman Mao issued the call to "fundamentally control the Huai River" in July last year, the Central People's Government has allocated huge amounts of grain and funds to carry out the Huai River control project. It is estimated that since last winter and this spring, 2,166,637 migrant workers have been mobilized, and 84,699,405 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. In addition to the Huai River control project, other water conservancy projects in East China are also unprecedentedly huge. It is estimated that various places have completed a total of 54,870,000 cubic meters of earthwork and 890,000 cubic meters of stone work last year and this spring, benefiting more than 27,042,300 mu of farmland.
    Cultural and educational work in East China has also become unprecedentedly active since liberation. All cultural and educational institutions that were used by imperialism to anesthetize the Chinese people in the past have been taken over by the Chinese people, and old cultural and educational institutions are being steadily transformed, and new cultural and educational institutions are developing rapidly. Workers' and peasants' literacy classes, schools for workers' and peasants' children, night schools, and winter schools have been widely established. Political theory and cultural learning have been carried out among cadres in government agencies. Various forms of mass cultural and artistic activities and literacy campaigns are being gradually carried out. Public health facilities, clinics, sanatoriums, etc. are being widely constructed. The cultural and political level of workers, peasants and the general people is constantly improving at an unprecedented rate.
    With the rapid recovery and development of industry and agriculture, with the smooth progress of land reform, and with the improvement of the cultural and political level of the workers and peasants, the people's democratic dictatorship has also been unprecedentedly consolidated. Now the Kuomintang's remnant bandits have been basically eliminated in East China, counter-revolutionaries have been punished, more than 2.3 million of the 3.6 million workers in East China have joined trade unions, and more than 32 million peasants have joined farmers' associations, including more than 15 million women members. In addition, there are more than 7.5 million members of cooperatives, more than 2.9 million militiamen, and the organization of the New Democratic Youth League, which has 1.4 million outstanding young people. The above-mentioned broad mass organizations are all firmly united with the Communist Party as the core, which is the source of our Party's infinite and invincible strength.
    Since US imperialism launched the heinous war of aggression in Korea on June 25 last year, East China has universally launched the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, and defend world peace and democracy. Of the 140 million people in East China, a total of 62,121,142 people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal last year. This year, as of May, a total of 68.12 million people in East China have held signature votes to support the conclusion of a peace covenant and oppose the US arming of Japan. The people of East China, like the people all over the country, have adopted various forms and methods to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. They deeply know that the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is the Chinese people's own struggle to defend their homes and country and defend the fruits of victory, and it is the Chinese people's most effective struggle to stop imperialist aggression and defend world peace and democracy.
    In the two years after the victory of the Chinese people, although we faced various difficulties, we relied on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and relied on the efforts of people from all walks of life, and we have achieved great achievements in politics, economy, culture, and in resisting US aggression, aiding Korea, and defending world peace.
    Two years ago, when US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits were driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, they predicted that we would not be able to manage a large industrial city like Shanghai, and they predicted that "although the Chinese people have won in the military field, they will soon encounter failure in the political field, especially in the economic field." The iron facts in the past two years have proved that the people of Shanghai and the people of China, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, are invincible not only in the military field but also in the political and economic fields.
    The Chinese people have deeply realized from their own experience that without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Mao Zedong, there would be no victory for the Chinese people today.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without a revolutionary party established according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." It is precisely because we have such a great and glorious revolutionary party - the Communist Party of China, and we have such a great and glorious people's leader - Comrade Mao Zedong, that this is the key to the Chinese people's ability to defeat all enemies at home and abroad in the past, to win the victory of the revolution, and in the future to overcome all difficulties and victoriously guide the Chinese people from new democracy to socialism and communism.
    Long live the great and glorious Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!

　　庆祝党的三十周年纪念
         饶漱石
    一九五一年七月一日是中国共产党建立三十周年纪念日。
    我们的党从建立时起，就是在马克思列宁主义的理论基础上，作为中国工人阶级的政党，作为中国民族解放和中国人民解放的先锋队而建立起来的。
    我们的党三十年来领导中国人民历经艰苦卓绝和曲折复杂的革命斗争，终于赢得了伟大的具有历史意义的胜利，成为伟大的中华人民共和国的创造者和领导者。
    当我党三十周年纪念的时候，全中国人民都怀着正当的自豪，来回忆着我们光荣的过去和注视着我们伟大的将来。
    上海是国际帝国主义近百年来侵略和奴役中国人民的堡垒，是国民党二十余年来统治和压榨中国人民的基地，同时又是全国工人阶级最集中的城市，又是中国共产党诞生的地方，所以，上海和华东的人民，现在能够在战胜帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的光荣胜利的环境中，来庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念，特别感到无限的兴奋和快慰。
    在帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余势力被赶出全中国大陆后，华东人民和全国各地人民一样，在中国共产党领导下，是以无比的热忱和忘我的精神来进行恢复和发展我国内经济生活；是以无比的愤怒和仇恨来反对美帝国主义的可耻的侵略朝鲜和台湾。
    华东各地在管理城市及接收工厂、矿山、企业等方面，一般是有成绩的。我们在执行中央指示统一全国财政经济、及保证税收、稳定物价，和在依靠工人阶级团结城市人民战胜敌人封锁轰炸，及维持和恢复工业生产等方面也是有成绩的。我们在敌人封锁及原料缺乏的条件下，对工业生产的恢复是比较快的。以占全国百分之七十以上的华东纺织业为例，计国营纺织业已开工者达百分之九十以上，私营纺织业已开工者亦达百分之八十左右。工人的生产积极性已普遍地提高，爱国主义劳动竞赛运动正在普遍地展开，纱和布的生产已超过了解放以前的水平。
    华东有近一万万农业人口的地区已经完成了土地改革。完成土地改革的地区，占华东全部农业人口百分之八十五，其余百分之十五尚未进行土地改革的地区，在今年年底也将要全部完成。在土地改革已经完成的地区，有六千万以上无地及少地的农民分到由地主那里没收来的土地、农具、粮食和房屋。在那里作为国内外敌人主要支持者的地主阶级已被消灭，恶霸地主和反抗土地改革的不法地主受到了惩罚，其他地主正在劳动改造中。由于土地改革和人民政府的大力支持生产，华东各地农民生产积极性已空前的提高。计一九五零年华东粮食生产较一九四九年（初解放的一年）增加百分之二十七点一，棉花生产超过一九四九年百分之一百一十二点三，工业用麻生产超过一九四九年百分之三十七点九，蚕丝生产超过一九四九年百分之三十点二。华东今年（一九五一年）工业原料种植的面积又大大的超过去年（一九五○年）。计种棉面积超过百分之四十五，烤烟面积超过四倍，工业用麻面积超过三倍半。由于工业原料的大量生产及农民生产和生活水平的不断提高，不但为工业的恢复和发展创造了巩固的基础，而且也大大地加强了工人阶级与农民的巩固联盟。
    由于过去国民党反动统治的腐败和水利长期失修，造成中国连年灾荒。仅去年华东淮北地区因淮河泛滥，即有三千一百六十二万亩土地被淹，灾民有近一千万之多。自去年七月毛主席发出“根治淮河”的号召后，中央人民政府即拨出巨额粮食和款项，进行治淮工程。计自去冬及今春即动员了民工二百一十六万六千六百三十七人，已完成土方八千四百六十九万九千四百零五公方。除治淮工程之外，华东其他水利工程亦属空前巨大，计去年及今春各地共完成土方五千四百八十七万余公方，石方八十九万余公方，受益农田达二千七百零四万二千三百余亩。
    华东各地自解放后文化教育工作也空前活跃起来。过去帝国主义麻醉中国人民的一切文化教育机构已全部由中国人民接收，旧的文化教育机关在稳步改造中，新的文化教育机构在迅速发展中。工农识字班、工农子弟学校、夜校、冬学等已普遍建立起来。在机关干部中进行了政治理论和文化的学习。各种形式的群众文艺运动与扫除文盲工作在逐步开展中。公共卫生设备、诊疗所、休养所等在广泛建设中。工人农民及一般人民的文化政治水平正以空前的速度不断地提高着。
    随着工业与农业的迅速恢复和发展，随着土地改革的顺利进行，随着工农群众文化政治水平的提高，人民民主专政也空前的巩固起来。现在全华东境内国民党残余土匪已基本肃清，反革命分子已受到处罚，全华东三百六十余万工人中已有二百三十余万人加入了职工会，有三千二百万以上的农民加入了农会，其中包括一千五百余万为妇女会员。此外合作社有七百五十多万社员，有二百九十余万的民兵，和有拥有一百四十万优秀青年的新民主主义青年团的组织。上述广大群众组织都是以共产党为核心而坚固地团结起来的，这就是我们的党具有无穷的和不可战胜的力量的源泉。
    当去年六月二十五日美帝国主义在朝鲜发动罪恶的侵略战争以来，华东各地便普遍展开反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平民主的抗美援朝运动。全华东区一亿四千万人口中，在去年斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的共有六千二百一十二万一千一百四十二人。今年截至五月份止，全华东区已有六千八百一十二万人对拥护缔结和平公约，反对美国武装日本举行了签名投票。华东人民和全国各地人民一样，采取了各种形式和方法进行支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。他们深知：抗美援朝斗争，即是中国人民自己保家卫国和保卫胜利果实的斗争，即是中国人民最有效地制止帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平民主的斗争。
    在中国人民胜利后的两年中，我们虽面对各种的困难，但我们依靠中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导，依靠各阶层人民的努力，我们在政治、经济、文化方面，在抗美援朝、保卫世界和平方面，都获得伟大的成就。
    两年前，当美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮被中国人民驱逐出中国大陆的时候，他们曾预言我们将无法管理好像上海这样大的工业城市，它们曾预言说：“中国人民在军事方面虽已获得胜利，但是不久它将在政治方面特别是在经济方面遭到失败。”两年来铁的事实证明：上海人民及全中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导下，不但在军事上而且在政治上和经济上同样是不可战胜的。
    中国人民从自身的经验中深刻地体会到：没有中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东的领导，就没有今天中国人民的胜利。
    毛泽东同志说：“没有一个按马、恩、列、斯的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级及广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”正是由于我们有了这样一个伟大的光荣的革命党——中国共产党，和我们有了这样一个伟大的光荣的人民领袖——毛泽东同志，这是中国人民过去能够战胜国内外一切敌人，争取革命的胜利，和将来同样能够战胜一切困难，胜利地引导中国人民经过新民主主义走向社会主义与共产主义的关键。
    伟大的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
