Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 24th: Members of the International Democratic Women's Federation delegation to Korea investigating the atrocities of the American army invading Korea, who have just returned from Korea, are reporting the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea to the people of various countries.

The secretary of the delegation, Czech representative Swatosova, said at a reception for reporters in Prague on the 15th: Although the American aggressors are carrying out crazy acts of terror, they cannot thwart the spirit of the heroic Korean people. On the 19th, the newspaper "Red Rights" published Swatosova's report on the atrocities of the American army invading Korea.

Argentine representative Argenio told reporters in Prague: We have experienced the atrocities of the Nazis in this century, and we did not expect the American army to do the same. She said: "We demand the establishment of an international tribunal to try those responsible for these crimes."

The Belgian newspaper "Red Flag" published on the first page on the 17th a call made by Haniva, the Belgian representative of the investigation delegation, at a reception for reporters in Brussels. Haniva spoke of the terrorist actions and massacres of the American aggressors in Korea. She said that she had personally seen entire forests and hundreds of acres of farmland burned by incendiary bombs. She demanded an end to the American army's massacre in Korea.

Danish representatives Bachmann and Carter condemned the terror created by the United States in Korea at a mass rally in Copenhagen. On the 11th, the newspaper "Land and People" published Bachmann's statement. The statement said: "There is no doubt that today the Americans are trying to exterminate the entire Korean people, just as the Nazis exterminated the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto."

Austrian representative Priester published a series of articles in the "Voice of the Austrian People" entitled "I Saw Korea," exposing the atrocities of the American army in Korea.

The Paris newspaper "Tonight" published three essays by French representative Gillette Tiggler and photos she brought back, which revealed the truth about the American army's destruction of peaceful Korean towns and the burying alive of Korean women and children.
