　　National Half-Month Agricultural Situation (May 20th to June 5th)
Xinhua News Agency
The half-month from May 20th to June 5th was a period of intense agricultural activity in most parts of the country. The final concentrated sowing of major autumn crops in the northern provinces and the rice transplanting in the southern provinces were basically completed. From south to north, the summer harvest and summer selection campaign are gradually unfolding; the campaign for mid-season cultivation and pest control is also becoming increasingly intense.

The sowing of major autumn crops and cotton fields across the country was largely completed in mid-May. Due to flooding in the south and drought in the north this spring, the spring planting season was delayed, and there were serious problems with missing cotton seedlings and seedling rot. From late May to early June, most areas of North China, Northwest China, East China, and Northeast China experienced heavy rainfall. After the rain, local people's governments immediately led the broad masses of farmers in a concentrated effort to sow major autumn crops and replant missing cotton seedlings. At present, the sowing of major autumn crops has been completed in North China, Northwest China, and the provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Songjiang in the Northeast. The sowing of dryland crops in the provinces south of the Yangtze River has also been completed.

Significant progress has also been made in the sowing of cash crops in various regions. The planting area for cotton and hemp in the entire Northeast region exceeded the planned targets. Cotton sowing in Northwest and North China has also been completed. Shaanxi and Gansu provinces planted 4.1 million mu of cotton this year, exceeding the original plan. Hebei Province, a major cotton-producing area, exceeded its original cotton planting plan by 25 percent and replanted all of its 300,000 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings. In East China, except for a few areas in southern and northern Jiangsu and Zhejiang where cotton fields have not yet been sown, cotton fields in all other areas have been completely sown. According to statistics, the cotton planting area in East China as a whole has exceeded the predetermined plan by more than 4 percent. The planting area for hemp and tobacco in the region also exceeded the original plans by 18 percent and 40 percent, respectively. In the Central South region, Hubei and Henan provinces both exceeded their planned cotton planting areas. Henan Province planted 1.13 million mu of tobacco, exceeding the plan by 36 percent. The cotton planting area in the Southwest region as a whole only reached 85 percent of the original plan, while the tobacco planting area is close to completing the predetermined task. Currently, cotton seedlings are emerging uniformly in various regions. In East China, the emergence rate of cotton seedlings is generally above 70 to 80 percent. In the Jinghui Canal irrigation area of Shaanxi Province, the emergence rate of cotton seedlings reached over 90 percent. The cotton seedlings are growing well.

The transplanting of rice seedlings in the provinces north and south of the Yangtze River in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China was basically completed by the end of May. Rice transplanting has also been completed in Ningxia, Xinjiang, and southern Shaanxi. Only parts of Zhejiang, southern Henan, and Guangdong are still transplanting rice. Due to excessive rain and cold weather this spring in the areas south of the Yangtze River, rice transplanting was delayed by about 10 to 20 days compared to previous years. Now, drought conditions have reappeared in Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and other places. Local people's governments are stepping up their efforts to lead farmers in building water conservancy projects to irrigate fields and transplant rice.

In early June, the summer harvest was nearing completion in the Southwest region and parts of the areas south of the Yangtze River. It has started in the Northwest region and Henan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, and the provinces in North China are preparing for the summer harvest. The summer harvest in the Southwest region this year is generally not as good as last year. Only broad beans have a better harvest than last year. The rapeseed yield is only half of last year's, and the unit yields of wheat and peas are both lower than last year's. However, due to the larger planting area compared to last year, the total output is slightly higher than last year. In Henan Province, a major wheat-producing area in Central South China, and the Guanzhong region of Northwest China, wheat harvesting began in early June; the harvest is estimated to be about 80 percent. In East China, Fujian Province completed its summer harvest in mid-May; barley, rapeseed, broad beans, and other crops in Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui have also been largely harvested. Wheat harvesting began in early June. The total wheat area in East China is approximately 135 million mu, and yields are expected to increase by more than 10 percent compared to last year, except for Fujian. Northern Anhui, a disaster-stricken area, had a bumper wheat harvest this year, with yields 30 percent higher than last year. During the summer harvest, the summer harvest and summer selection competition launched by 47 mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, has been launched in various places. In the major wheat-producing areas across the country, the Northwest region alone has more than 3,000 mutual aid teams responding to the challenge, and nearly 10,000 mutual aid teams have participated in local chain competitions. Summer seed selection work has been widely launched in major wheat-producing areas across the country. Farmers in various regions attach great importance to this work. In many areas, men, women, old, and young in rural areas participate in field ear selection, forming a widespread seed selection movement.

In addition, various degrees of pest infestations have been detected in various regions over the past half month. Cotton aphids have been found in the Northwest region and Hebei and Pingyuan provinces. Wireworms and other pests have been found in Chahar and central Shanxi Province. More than 50 counties in the Northeast have found pest infestations, with more than a dozen types of pests. The Japanese beetle is the most harmful to cotton seedlings and sunflowers. Rice stem borers have been found in many areas of the southern provinces. It is particularly noteworthy that large numbers of locust nymphs have been found in Shandong, Hebei, Xinjiang, and the area around Hongze Lake in northern Anhui. Currently, local people's governments are leading farmers to actively prevent and control various pests to prevent their spread.

The country has entered a tense stage of summer production. In the next half month, the main tasks in agricultural production will be to continue the summer harvest and summer selection work, and summer planting will begin in some areas. To protect the growth of crops, weeding and pest control are also becoming increasingly important. At the same time, drought and flood prevention work must also be strengthened in various regions. To this end, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has issued summer production instructions, calling on all parts of the country to work hard to do the above work well and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

　　全国半月农情（五月二十日至六月五日）
    五月二十日到六月五日的半个月，全国大部地区都处在一个最紧张的农忙季节。北方各省大秋作物的最后突击播种和南方各省稻田的插秧，已经基本上完成了。从南到北，各地夏收和夏选运动正逐渐展开；中耕和防治虫害的运动也日渐紧张起来。
    全国各地大秋作物和棉田播种在五月中旬即已大致完成。由于今春南涝北旱，春耕播种时间延迟，棉田缺苗和秧苗霉烂现象严重。五月下旬至六月初，华北、西北、华东和东北的大部地区普降大雨，雨后，各地人民政府立即领导广大农民进行突击播种大秋作物和棉田的补苗工作。目前，华北、西北及东北区的辽东、辽西、吉林、松江等省的大秋作物的播种都已完成。长江以南各省的旱田播种，也都全部结束。
    各地经济作物的播种也有很大成绩。东北全区种棉和种麻的面积都超过了计划。西北、华北棉花播种也已结束。陕西、甘肃两省今年种棉四百一十万亩，超过了原来的计划。主要产棉区河北省植棉亩数超过原计划的百分之二十五，该省并把三十多万亩缺苗棉田全部补种起来。华东区除苏南、苏北及浙江少数地区的棉田还未下种外，其余各地棉田已全部播种完毕。据统计，华东全区植棉面积已超过预定计划的百分之四以上。该区麻、烟播种面积也分别超过原来计划的百分之十八与四十。中南区的湖北、河南两省播种棉田面积均超过计划，河南省烟叶播种一百一十三万亩，超过计划百分之三十六。西南全区植棉面积仅完成原计划的百分之八十五，种烟面积已接近完成预定任务。现在，各地棉田出苗均匀。华东区的棉田出苗一般在七、八成以上。陕西省泾惠渠灌溉地区，棉田出苗达百分之九十以上。棉苗成长情况甚好。
    华东、中南和西南区长江南北各省的稻田插秧，五月底已经基本上完成。宁夏、新疆和陕南的稻田也插完了秧。只有浙江、豫南、广东部分地区还在插秧。长江以南今春雨多地寒，插秧比往年推迟约一、二十天不等。现在，江西、湖南、四川等地又有旱象，各地人民政府正在加紧领导农民兴修水利，灌田插秧。
    六月初，夏收在西南区和长江以南的部分地区已近结束，西北区和河南、苏北、皖北等地已经开始，华北各省正在准备夏收。西南区今年夏季的收成一般不如去年，只有蚕豆收成比去年好，油菜籽产量仅及去年的一半，小麦和豌豆的单位产量都比去年低，但因播种面积比去年大，总产量比去年略高。中南的主要产麦区河南省和西北的关中地区，六月初都已开始收麦；收成约为八成。华东区福建省的夏收五月中旬就已完毕；浙江、苏北、苏南、皖南等地的大麦、油菜、蚕豆等作物，也大体收割完毕，六月初已动手收割小麦。华东全区小麦约一亿三千五百多万亩，除福建外，都比去年增产一成以上。皖北灾区今年小麦丰收，收成比去年高三成。夏收中，陕西兴平县四十七个互助组所发动的夏收和夏选的竞赛已在各地展开，全国各主要产麦区仅西北区即有三千多个互助组应战，并有近万个互助组参加了地方性的连环竞赛。夏季选种工作，在全国各产麦区已普遍开始，各地农民对这一工作非常重视，许多地区农村中男女老幼都参加了田间穗选，形成了广泛的选种运动。
    此外，半个月中各地已开始发现各种轻重不同的虫害。西北区及河北、平原两省已发现棉蚜，察南和山西省晋中等地都发现了金针虫等虫害。东北发现虫害的地区有五十多县，害虫有十多种，其中以金龟子对棉苗和向日葵等作物为害最烈。南方各省发现水稻螟虫的地区亦很普遍。特别值得注意的是山东、河北、新疆等地及皖北洪泽湖周围地区已发现了大批蝗蝻。现在，各地人民政府正领导农民积极防治各种虫害，以防止虫害蔓延。
    全国已进入夏季生产的紧张阶段，今后半月农业生产上的主要任务，将是继续进行夏收夏选工作，部分地区且将开始夏种。为了保护禾苗的生长，锄草和防治虫害亦日渐紧要。同时各地防旱防涝工作也须加强。为此，中央农业部已发出夏季生产指示，号召全国各地努力做好以上工作，争取今年农业丰收。
