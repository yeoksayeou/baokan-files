Our Great Motherland

According to legend, today is the anniversary of the death of our country's great patriotic poet Qu Yuan. Qu Yuan was born in the state of Chu around 2,300 years ago. Because he expressed dissatisfaction with the darkness of the politics at the time, he was exiled by the reactionary rulers, and he drowned himself in the Miluo River 2,250 years ago. His long poem "Li Sao" and other poems are a valuable legacy of our country's literature and art.

    我们伟大的祖国
    按照传说，今天是我国伟大的爱国诗人屈原的忌辰。在二千三百年前左右，屈原生于楚国。他因为对当时政治的黑暗表示不满，被反动的统治者所放逐，就在二千二百五十年前投汩罗江而死。他的长诗“离骚”和其他诗篇是我国文艺的宝贵遗产。
