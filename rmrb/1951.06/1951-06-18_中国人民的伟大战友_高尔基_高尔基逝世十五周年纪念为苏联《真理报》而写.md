　　The Great Comrade-in-Arms of the Chinese People – Gorky
    — Written for the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" on the 15th Anniversary of Gorky's Death
　　Cao Jinghua

            I
    Gorky, this far-sighted thinker, outstanding artist, and great warrior who fought his entire life for the cause of human liberation, deeply cared about the Chinese revolutionary movement as early as fifty years ago. In a letter to Chekhov in July 1900, he said:
    "The thought of going to China has conquered me. I really want to go to China! I haven't had such a strong desire for anything in a long time."
    At that time, it was the period of the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance, a time of extremely acute social struggle and anti-imperialist struggle. The "revolutionary petrel" longed to come to the Chinese revolutionary storm. His sympathy for the Chinese revolution was very obvious.
    Later, in October 1912, Gorky's letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen more clearly and enthusiastically expressed his expectations for the Chinese revolution, his hatred and condemnation of the invaders, including the Tsarist Russian invaders, and foresaw the situation forty years later when the two peoples, under the wise and great leadership of the two countries' leaders—Stalin and Chairman Mao—realized a truly brotherly and comradely relationship. The letter said:
    "I, a Russian, am fighting for the victory of those ideals just like you: no matter where this ideal triumphs, you and I will feel happy for this victory... We are brothers in spirit and comrades in ambition, but our government and its lackeys want to make the Russian people take a hostile stance towards the Chinese people. We socialists, who truly believe that the whole world can and must live like brothers, should we allow those greedy and ignorant people to promote the development of racial hatred and let it become a dark and solid wall on the road to socialism? On the contrary, we must do everything possible to combat all the vicious attempts of our enemies, the enemies of the best of humanity, who are preparing to extinguish the sunlight in order to more easily carry out their dark and greedy deeds—spreading the seeds of national hatred in the world and oppressing the people."
    Today, forty years later, the great Chinese people who have stood up feel so亲切 (qīnqiè - warm, affectionate) when rereading this precious historical document! Forty years ago, Gorky's ideal, under the leadership of the two peoples' great leaders, not only made the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union as close as brothers and comrades, supporting each other and working together to build the most幸福 (xìngfú - happy, blessed) society for mankind, but also more resolutely打击 (dǎjī - attacked) "all the vicious attempts of the enemies of the best of humanity" and eliminated the most barbaric American fascist bandits who are "preparing to extinguish the sunlight."
    In an unpublished speech Gorky gave to the representatives of the Amsterdam Anti-War Congress in 1932, he expressed unparalleled indignation at the Japanese bandits' invasion of China:
    "…The most submissive lackeys of the capitalists have been discussing the issue of disarmament in Europe for months on end, while you all know that, while they are talking nonsense, the Japanese capitalists are openly and unpunished looting China, occupying Manchuria, and killing and continuing to kill millions of innocent people. In Shanghai, countless cultural treasures of significance to all mankind have been destroyed."
    Gorky not only violently attacked the imperialist bandits for massacring the Chinese people, destroying Chinese culture, and plundering Chinese wealth, but also expressed boundless excitement at the victory of the Chinese people and gave tremendous encouragement to the Chinese people in their struggle. In "To the Chinese Revolutionary Writers," published in Pravda on September 3, 1934, he said:
    "Chinese comrades! On behalf of the Soviet writers, I congratulate you on your new victory and firmly believe that you will overthrow the enemy and achieve final victory. I salute the heroic spirit of the proletariat of your country!…I extend my warmest Bolshevik greetings to the Chinese comrades!"
    We cannot help but feel万分沉痛 (wànfēn chéntòng - extremely grieved) today, on the fifteenth anniversary of the departure of this great comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, who loudly called for坚决反对 (jiānjué fǎnduì - resolutely oppose) the imperialist bandits' invasion of China and deeply cared for and encouraged the Chinese people's liberation movement. At that time, the Shanghai Chinese Literary and Art Circles Association, led by Mr. Lu Xun, sent a telegram to Moscow saying: "The death of the great writer Gorky of the Soviet Union and the world is the most重大打击 (zhòngdà dǎjī - heavy blow) for us." This represented the profound mourning of the entire Chinese people for their comrade-in-arms.

            II
    In my article "Talking about Soviet Literature" in the May issue of "People's Literature" magazine, I said:
    "The October Revolution guided the Chinese revolution to achieve a great victory. The Soviet literature produced on the world-historical basis of the October Revolution and the achievements of socialist construction has had a deeper and wider impact on Chinese literature and the Chinese revolution than the literature of any other country in the world… Soviet literature has not only influenced the thinking of a generation of Chinese youth, but also the revolutionary actions of a generation of Chinese youth. Many young people, after reading Soviet literary works for the first time, were inspired and encouraged to join the revolutionary ranks and participate in the actual struggle of the revolution."
    Among Soviet literature, Gorky's works had the greatest impact on Chinese readers. Mr. Guo Moruo said in his article "Cultural Exchanges between China and the Soviet Union": "Gorky's influence on Chinese writers is directly超文学的 (chāo wénxué de - beyond the literary). He is崇敬 (chóngjìng - revered),爱慕 (àimù - admired), and追随 (zhuīsuí - followed) by Chinese writers; his life has been赋与了神性 (fùyǔle shénxìng - endowed with divinity), and his works have been视为 (shìwéi - regarded) as "the Bible," especially his literary theories, which have had no less an impact on China than in the Soviet Union itself. The lifestyle and creative process of literary and art workers have been普遍 (pǔbiàn - generally) and深切 (shēnqiè - deeply) instructed. Through this, we can not only know how to create or what to create, but also learn how to live or become a certain kind of person. In the spiritual world of our literary and art workers, the position occupied by Gorky seems to find no one in the long history of Chinese literature and art who can be匹敌 (pǐdí - match) him."
    There is absolutely no exaggeration here. Gorky has indeed become a name known to all Chinese women and children. His works are recited by people of all social classes in China. His plays, especially "The Lower Depths," are being performed in major cities in China. Movies based on his works, such as: "My Childhood," "My Universities," "My Apprenticeship," "Mother"... have become the most familiar and beloved films for the vast Chinese film audience. These have become an不可分的一部分 (bùkě fēn de yībùfèn - inseparable part) of the new Chinese people's cultural life. Almost all of his works have been translated into Chinese, and many works often have four or five Chinese translations. And his "The Lower Depths" has ten translations, one of which is an adaptation. This is an unprecedented example in the Chinese literary world for half a century.
    Last October, Xinhua Bookstore published a small book "Gorky - The Founder of Socialist Literature." At the end of the volume is attached a "Translated Catalog of Gorky's Works," according to this incomplete statistics: (1) 14 kinds of short story collections; (2) 13 kinds of single short stories; (3) 29 kinds of novellas and novels; (4) 20 kinds of plays; (5) 5 kinds of memoirs and biographies; (6) 12 kinds of literary essays; (7) 4 kinds of collections of social essays; (8) 12 kinds of selections; (9) 11 kinds of Gorky biographies; (10) 7 kinds of works studying Gorky.
    This is an extremely不完全的统计 (bùwánquán de tǒngjì - incomplete statistic), and there are probably quite a few omissions. It includes translated versions of one book with multiple translations. All those scattered in newspapers and magazines and included in other writers' collections but not published separately are not included. According to this survey, there are a total of one hundred and twenty-seven kinds. If we add the omissions and the newly published ones from last October to now, the total number is probably no less than one hundred and fifty kinds. No other writer in the world has been so popular in China. This is what Mr. Guo Moruo called "无与匹敌 (wúyǔ pǐdí - unparalleled)." Mr. Lu Xun said in the preface to "Russian Fairy Tales" sixteen years ago: "Gorky, this person and his works, are already known to everyone in China, so there is no need to say more."
    The high evaluation of Gorky by Chinese writers is also unmatched by any foreign writer. Mr. Lu Xun said in a letter to a friend: "As for Gorky, he is great, and I don't think anyone can compare." (Lu Xun's Letters, page 824).
    Mr. Mao Dun said in his article "Gorky and Chinese Literature": "The new literature of young China has received many valuable guidance from Gorky. Since the May Fourth Movement, our new literary and art workers have encountered many problems in practice, and these problems can all be found answers in Gorky's works. Since the May Fourth Movement, the road of Chinese new literature has been the road of realism. There is more than one factor that constitutes Chinese realistic literature. The excellent tradition of Russian literature and the influence of European classical literature should all be counted; but Gorky's influence should undoubtedly be regarded as the most direct and the greatest. Since the May Fourth Movement, there have been many foreign writers who have become the object of our attention, but after thirty years, only Gorky is still the highest典范 (diǎnfàn - model, example) for new literary and art workers today, and he will still be in the future; just from this point, we can also know how closely the great artist, thinker, and China's new literature is related to Gorky. As for Chinese progressive writers, they have not only accepted the spirit of fighting from Gorky's works, but also learned how to love and hate, what to love, what to hate; and more from Gorky's lifelong career, they know how a writer should live if he hopes not to break away from the masses."
    Martyr Qu Qiubai said in the conclusion of his postscript to the translation of Gorky's works "Hai Shang Shu Lin": "... Gorky's books are not books to comfort us, they are books to awaken us. Such books should 'teach us how to live tomorrow.'"
    Mr. Guo Moruo said that Gorky's influence on China is directly "超文学的 (chāo wénxué de - beyond the literary)." This is by no means an exaggeration, but a fact. His works, his spirit, his call, like Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have武装 (wǔzhuāng - armed) the Chinese people for decades, drove out the imperialism that had occupied China for more than a hundred years under the banner of Mao Zedong,摧毁了 (cuīhuǐle - destroyed) the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and enabled the Chinese people to achieve liberation. He is still arming the Chinese people and will achieve more辉煌 (huīhuáng - brilliant, splendid) victories in the fight against American imperialist aggression and the construction of new China.
    "We are brothers in spirit and comrades in ambition," Gorky's fervent hope for the two major nations of China and Russia forty years ago has been fully realized under the wise policies of Stalin and Chairman Mao. The two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, armed with a high degree of ideology, are united as one with精诚无间 (jīngchéng wújiàn - absolute sincerity) on the basis of Gorky's spirit. This is an invincible force that guards world peace. The two major nations of China and the Soviet Union - seven hundred million heroic guards guarding world peace, will always remember Gorky's battle call!

　　中国人民的伟大战友——高尔基
    ——高尔基逝世十五周年纪念为苏联《真理报》而写
　　曹靖华
            一
    高尔基，这位远见的思想家，卓越的艺术家，为人类解放事业而奋斗一生的伟大战士，五十年前就深切地关怀着中国革命运动。他在一九○○年七月给柴霍甫的信中就说：
    “到中国去的念头把我征服了。我非常想到中国去！好久以来，都没有像这样强烈的愿望过什么事。”
    当时正是义和团起义以及八国联军侵入中国，是社会斗争与反帝斗争极尖锐的时期。“革命的海燕”，渴望着到中国革命风暴里来，他对中国革命的同情，是很显然的了。
    稍后，到一九一二年十月，高尔基给孙中山先生的信中更明确而热诚地表示了对中国革命的期望，对侵略者，连沙皇俄国的侵略者也在内，对他们的痛恶与掊击，并且预见了四十年后在两国人民的英明伟大领袖——斯大林与毛主席的领导下，实现了两国人民真正亲如兄弟，爱如同志的局面。那信上说：
    “我，俄国人，正同你一样，都为了那些理想的胜利而斗争：不管这理想在什么地方胜利，我和你都为这胜利而感到幸福……我们在精神上是弟兄，在志向上是同志，可是我国政府和它的奴才们，却要使俄国人民站到仇视中国人民的立场上去。我们社会主义者们，真正相信全世界都可以，而且一定可以弟兄般的生活着的人们，我们难道应该允许那些贪婪和愚妄的人们，助长种族仇恨的发展，让它成为社会主义道路上的一堵阴暗而坚固的墙壁吗？相反的，我们要尽一切努力，去打击我们的一切敌人，全世界优秀人类的敌人所有恶毒的企图，这些敌人准备息灭日光以便更顺利地去做他们黑暗贪婪的勾当——在世界上散布民族仇恨的种子，压迫人民。”
    四十年后的今日，站起来了的伟大的中国人民，重读这一件珍贵的历史文献，是感到何等的亲切！四十年前高尔基的理想，在两国人民伟大领袖的领导下，中苏两大民族不但亲如兄弟、同志，互相扶持，携手建造人类最幸福的社会，而且更坚决地打击那“全世界优秀人类的敌人所有恶毒的企图”，消灭那些“准备息灭日光”的最野蛮的美国法西斯强盗。
    一九三二年高尔基致阿姆斯特丹反战大会代表们的未发表的演讲词中，对日本强盗的侵略中国，更表示了无比的愤慨：
    “………资本家的最恭顺的奴仆们，接连好几个月地讨论着欧洲必须裁军的问题，而你们都知道，当他们正在高谈阔论的时候，日本资本家却公开地和毫不受处分地抢掠了中国，侵占了满洲，杀戮了并且继续杀戮着千万的无辜人民。在上海，无数的具有全人类意义的文化宝藏被毁灭了。”
    高尔基不但对帝国主义强盗的屠杀中国人民，毁灭中国文化，掠夺中国财富，给以猛烈的打击，而且对中国人民的胜利表示了无限振奋，对斗争中的中国人民给了莫大的鼓舞。一九三四年九月三日《真理报》上发表的《致中国革命作家》中说：
    “中国同志们！我以苏维埃作家的名义祝贺你们的新胜利，并且坚信你们将打倒敌人，获得最后的胜利，谨向贵国无产阶级的英勇精神致敬！……向中国同志敬致热烈的布尔什维克的慰问！”
    这位大声疾呼，坚决反对帝国主义强盗侵略中国，深切关怀并鼓舞中国人民解放运动的中国人民的伟大战友，在十五年前的今日，在他离开我们的时候，是不能不感到万分沉痛的。在当时，上海中国文艺界协会，由鲁迅先生领衔，拍电报到莫斯科说：“苏联和全世界的伟大作家高尔基的逝世，对于我们，是一个最重大的打击。”这是代表了全中国人民对他的战友的沉痛的哀悼。
            二
    今年五月号的《人民文学》杂志上，我写了一篇《谈苏联文学》，有一段说：
    “十月革命引导中国革命，获得了伟大胜利，在十月革命世界性的基础上和社会主义建设的成就上产生出来的苏联文学，对中国文学及中国革命影响的深刻与宽广，为世界任何国家的文学所不及……苏联文学不但影响了中国一代青年的思想，而且也影响了一代青年的革命行动。广大青年，最初读了苏联文学作品，受了启发、鼓舞，投入革命行列，参加了革命的实际斗争。”
    苏联文学对中国读者影响最大的，则莫如高尔基的作品。郭沫若先生在《中苏文化之交流》一文中说：“高尔基对中国作家的影响，迳直是超文学的。他被中国作家们崇敬。爱慕、追随；他的生活被赋与了神性，他的作品被视为了“圣经”，尤其是他的文学论，对中国的影响是决不亚于在苏联本国。文艺工作者的生活态度和创作过程，普遍而深切地受着了指示。我们借此不仅可以知道应该如何去创作或创作些什么，而且还学习了应该如何生活或成为一个怎样的人。高尔基在我们文艺工作者的精神上所占的地位，在中国长远的文艺史上，似乎还找不出一个人可以和他匹敌。”
    这里毫没有言之过甚的地方。高尔基的确成了中国妇孺皆知的名字。他的作品，中国各阶层的人都在传诵着他的剧本，尤其是《夜店》，中国各大城市在演出着，根据他的作品所制的电影，如：《我的童年》，《我的大学》，《在人间》，《母亲》……成了中国广大的电影观众最熟悉而且最爱的片子。这些都成了新中国人民文化生活的不可分的一部分。他的作品，几乎全部都译成了中文，有好多作品，往往有四五个中译本。而他的《夜店》就有十个译本，其中有一个是改编的。这是半世纪以来，中国文坛上所没有的例子。
    去年十月新华书店出版了一本小书“高尔基——社会主义文学的奠基人”。卷末附有“高尔基作品中译目录”，据这一个不完全的统计：（一）短篇小说集十四种；（二）短篇单本十三种；（三）中篇及长篇二十九种；（四）剧本二十种；（五）回忆及传记五种；（六）文学论文十二种；（七）社会论文集四种；（八）选集十二种；（九）高尔基传记十一种；（十）研究高尔基的著作七种。
    这是一个极不完全的统计，遗漏之处，恐不在少。其中包括了一书数译的译本。至历来散见于各地报纸、杂志以及收入其他作家集内而未单行者，均未列入。根据这个调查，共有一百二十七种。如果加上所遗漏的以及去年十月到现在新出版的，其总数恐怕不下一百五十种。世界作家，在中国如此风行的没有第二人。这就是郭沫若先生所说的“无与匹敌”了。鲁迅先生在十六年前，在《俄罗斯童话》序文里就说：“高尔基这人和作品，在中国已为大家所知道，不必多说了。”
    中国作家对高尔基的评价之高，也是任何外国作家所不及。鲁迅先生在致友人书中说：“至于高尔基，那是伟大的，我看无人可比。”（《鲁迅书简》八二四页）。
    茅盾先生在《高尔基和中国文学》一文中说：“青年的中国的新文艺，从高尔基那里得到许多宝贵的指导。“五四”以来，我们的新文艺工作者在实践中曾经遇到好些问题，而这些问题都可以在高尔基的作品中找到解答。“五四”以来，中国新文艺的道路是现实主义的道路，构成中国现实主义文艺的因素不只一个，俄国文学的优秀的传统以及欧洲古典文学的影响，都是应当算进去的；但是高尔基的影响无疑的应当视为最直接而且最大。“五四”以来，曾经有好多位外国的作家，成为我们注意的对象，但是经过三十年之久，唯有高尔基今天依然是新文艺工作者最高的典范，而且以后也会仍然是的；单就这一点来看，也可以知道高尔基这位伟大的艺术家、思想家和中国新文艺的关系是如何密切了。至于中国进步的作家呢，则不但从高尔基的作品里接受了战斗的精神，也学习了如何爱与憎，爱什么，憎恨什么；更从高尔基的一生事业中知道了一个作家如果希望不脱离群众，便应当怎样生活。”
    瞿秋白烈士在《海上述林》高尔基作品译后记的结语说：“……高尔基的书却不是安慰我们的书，这是惊醒我们的书，这样的书要‘教会我们明天怎样去生活。’”
    郭沫若先生说高尔基对中国的影响，迳直是“超文学的”。这绝非夸张，而是事实。他的作品，他的精神，他的号召，同马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想一样，数十年来，武装了中国人民，在毛泽东旗帜下，驱逐了盘据百余年的帝国主义，摧毁了国民党的反动统治，使中国人民获得了解放。他还在武装着中国人民，在反对美帝国主义侵略及新中国建设上，将获得更辉煌的胜利。
    “我们在精神上是弟兄，在志向上是同志，”高尔基的四十年前对中俄两大民族的热望，在英明的斯大林与毛主席的政策下，完全实现了。具有高度思想武装的中苏两大民族，在高尔基的精神基础上，精诚无间的团结成一体了。这是拱卫世界和平的无敌的力量，中苏两大民族——七万万刚勇的警卫世界和平的卫士，永远牢记着高尔基的战斗的号召！
    “如果敌人不投降，那就消灭他！”（附图片）
