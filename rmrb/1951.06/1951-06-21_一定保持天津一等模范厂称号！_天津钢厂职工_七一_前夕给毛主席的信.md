　　We Will Definitely Maintain the Title of Tianjin First-Class Model Factory!
    ——Letter from Tianjin Steel Plant Workers to Chairman Mao on the Eve of "July 1st"
Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the entire staff of the Tianjin Steel Plant, are reporting our work to you with immense joy as the birthday of our own Party is approaching.
    Under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, and with the constant help of Soviet experts, our factory has achieved rapid recovery and development in the past two years, and has won the honorary title of Tianjin First-Class Model Factory. In Red May, all production departments of our factory overfulfilled their tasks, and our steelmaking department is a national model steelmaking workshop. In Red May, it completed its task three days and five hours ahead of schedule. The output of steel ingots exceeded the task by 12.6%, the quality was improved by 19% compared with the previous period, and the operation was improved, and the tapping time per furnace was reduced by about 20 minutes compared with the previous period. Other branch factories also overfulfilled their tasks by 4.5% to 69.4%. As of the 18th of June, we are gradually improving and progressing in terms of both quantity and quality. We are confident that we will overfulfill the production task for June.
    Our technicians and workers are closely united, and the research and study of Soviet high-speed cutting has been successful, increasing efficiency by up to 19 times. Comrade Niu Baotian, a welder, succeeded in trial-producing low-carbon steel welding rods after eight months of painstaking research and with the help of technicians. The quality not only exceeds that of Japanese red welding rods, but also has a tensile strength 7.7% greater than that of American white welding rods, and the cost is also very low. Because the staff are thinking hard and trying to find solutions, 158 rationalization proposals have been received, which have made great contributions to production. For example, the use of workers' opinions in the first branch factory has increased the working efficiency of rebar rolling groove picking by ten times, and there have also been improvements in labor organization. For example, the galvanizing plant has improved its labor organization, saving twelve people in three shifts. Therefore, following the creation of 16 new records by the steelmaking department in April, all departments of the factory created a total of 43 new records in May. For example, the life of the Martin furnace front wall has been extended by as much as 94% compared with the previous period, the average actual working day output has increased by 1.97%, and the quality of rolled steel has increased from 92.5% to 99.72%.
    Not only has our production increased, but our lives have also improved. Since the beginning of this year, we have received 17 awards, with the highest individual award reaching 2 million yuan. Almost everyone has one or two new sets of clothes, and many comrades have several bags of flour stored at home. Before liberation, we only had one doctor in the general factory, and he was disabled. He only came once or twice a week and could not actually treat illnesses, and industrial injuries were not taken care of at all. Now we have three clinics, more than a dozen medical staff, and two contracted hospitals. Before, the place where we took baths had no doors or windows in winter, and there was not even a place to store clothes. It was a mess. Now we have the latest style of pool baths, tub baths, and rain showers; and labor insurance regulations are being implemented.
    Chairman Mao: Not only have we improved our lives economically, but we have also been given the opportunity to improve our skills and learn culture. The vast majority of our factory employees have participated in cultural studies, 246 new workers have signed apprenticeship contracts with veteran workers, 138 workers have participated in spare-time technical training classes in metallurgy, drawing, and electrical engineering, more than 100 new and old employees have signed business teaching contracts, and more than 100 employees have participated in various technical research associations. We are currently short of people, but thanks to learning, those of us who were illiterate have become literate, and we also understand the basic principles of steelmaking, which makes us feel much clearer!
    Our labor models are advancing alongside us! Thanks to the creation of his technical research association and the responsible handover of the shift system by Liu Changfu, a special labor model in the city, the rate of qualified products has reached 100%. The two infrastructure projects led by labor model Xu Jingsheng were completed 26 days ahead of schedule. Yang Wanlu, a special labor model in the city, and his model team created a special silk washing system, which improved the quality by 25%. Our deputy director, Engineer Yang Cuifang, is also a special labor model in the city. He is studying how to implement technical regulations and improve product quality. He said: "Our technicians must closely combine with the workers, and humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, use our brains, and must improve output and quality, and reduce costs." All of our employees are advancing.
    Respected Chairman Mao: Today, as the birthday of our working class party is approaching, we assure you that we will definitely maintain the glorious title of Tianjin First-Class Model Factory, and we will definitely strive to consolidate the glorious title of our national model workshop. In the future, we will thoroughly achieve:
    (1) Complete the plan, consolidate achievements, improve quality, increase output, take care of our health, take care of machines, and eliminate liability accidents.
    (2) Cultivate models, promote mutual assistance, summarize and promote advanced experience, and create collective models.
    (3) Strengthen democratic management, vigorously carry out rationalization proposals, and gradually establish contact contracts.
    (4) Implement quota management, establish and improve the production responsibility system, establish workshop cost accounting, and universally promote the economic accounting system.
    Chairman Mao: We will definitely move towards this goal. We will overcome production difficulties just like the Volunteer Army fighting against the US imperialist aggressors. We guarantee that production will increase inch by inch. Finally, let all the employees of our factory wish you good health and shout in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!
        All the staff of Tianjin Steel Plant, Steel Bureau, Ministry of Heavy Industry
              June 18th

### 一定保持天津一等模范厂称号！——天津钢厂职工“七一”前夕给毛主席的信

　　一定保持天津一等模范厂称号！
    ——天津钢厂职工“七一”前夕给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们天津钢厂的全体职工，在我们自己的党的生日快要来到的时候，以无限愉快的心情向您报告我们的工作。
    在您和共产党的领导下，加以苏联专家经常的帮助，我们工厂在两年来获得了迅速的恢复和发展，获得了天津市一等模范厂的荣誉称号。红五月里我厂各生产部门普遍超额完成任务，我们的炼钢部是全国炼钢模范车间，在红五月中，提前三天又五小时完成任务。钢锭产量超过任务百分之十二点六，质量较前提高百分之十九，并且改进了操作，出钢时间每炉较前缩减二十分钟左右。其他各分厂部亦超额完成任务百分之四点五至六十九点四。六月份截至十八日止，不论在数量上和质量上，我们都在逐渐提高，逐渐进步。我们有信心超额完成六月份生产任务。
    我们的技术人员和工人紧密团结，钻研学习苏联高速切削已获成功，提高效率最高达十九倍。焊工牛宝田同志，经过八个月的苦心研究，技术人员的帮助，试制低炭钢焊条成功，品质不但超过日本红色焊条，且比美国白色焊条拉力大百分之七点七，成本亦很低。由于职工都用心想办法，现已收到合理化建议一百五十八件，对于生产贡献很大。如一分厂采用工友意见，使竹节钢轧辊剔槽工作效率提高十倍，并且在劳动组织上也有改进。如镀锌场改进了劳动组织，三班节省了十二个人。因此，我们继四月份炼钢部创十六项新纪录之后，五月份全厂各部门共创四十三件新纪录。如马丁炉前墙寿命较前延长高达百分之九十四，平均实际工作日产量提高百分之一点九七，轧钢质量由百分之九十二点五提高到百分之九十九点七二。
    我们不但生产提高了，生活也得到了改善。我们今年以来，获得了十七次奖励，最高个人奖达二百万元。差不多谁都有一两套新衣服，很多同志家里都存着几个面。解放前我们只总厂有一个医生，还是个残废，每星期只来一两次，实际上不能治病，公伤疾病根本不管。现在我们厂里有了三个医务室，十多个医务人员，并有两处特约医院。以前我们洗澡的地方，冬天也没有门窗，连存衣服的地方也没有，糟得不像样子，现在我们有了最新式的池堂、盆堂和雨淋浴；并实行了劳动保险条例。
    毛主席：我们不但经济上改善了生活，我们同时得到了提高技术和学习文化的机会，我厂职工绝大多数都参加了文化学习，二百四十六名新工友与老工友签订了师徒合同，一百三十八名工友参加了冶金、绘图、电工等业余技术训练班，一百多名新老职员订了业务教学合同，百人以上的职工参加着各种技术研究会，我们现在人缺，但由于学习，我们原来不识字的识字了，我们也懂得了炼钢的基本原理，心里可亮堂啦！
    我们的劳动模范和我们一起并肩前进！由于全市特等劳动模范刘长福创造了他的技术研究会和交接班制度的责任交接，合格品曾达到百分之百。劳动模范徐敬生领导的两个基建工程提前二十六天完成了任务。全市特等劳动模范杨万禄和他的模范小组创造了洗丝专责制，提高质量百分之二十五。我们的副厂长杨萃芳工程师，又是全市特等劳动模范，他正在研究如何实施技术规程，改善产品质量，他说：“我们技术人员要和工友们紧密结合，并且虚心学习苏联先进经验，开动脑筋，一定要把产量质量提高，成本降低。”我们全体职工都在前进中。
    敬爱的毛主席：今天，当着我们工人阶级的党的生日即将到来的时候，我们向您保证，我们一定保持天津一等模范厂的光荣称号，我们一定为巩固我们全国的模范车间的光荣称号而努力，我们今后彻底作到：
    （一）完成计划，巩固成绩，提高质量，加强产量，爱护身体，爱护机器，消灭责任事故。
    （二）培养典型，提倡互助，总结和推广先进经验，创造集体模范。
    （三）加强民主管理，大力开展合理化建议，逐步建立联系合同。
    （四）实行定额管理，建立与健全生产责任制，建立车间成本核算，普遍推行经济核算制。
    毛主席：我们一定朝着这个目标前进，我们战胜生产上的困难就像志愿军打击美帝国主义侵略者一样，我们保证生产一寸一寸地长上去，最后让我们全厂职工敬祝您的身体健康，并齐声高呼：毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！
        中央重工业部钢铁工业局天津钢厂全体职工
              六月十八日
