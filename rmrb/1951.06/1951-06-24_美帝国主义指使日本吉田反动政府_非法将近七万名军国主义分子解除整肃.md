　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: According to instructions from Ridgway, the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government formally announced on the 20th the removal of the purge measures against nearly 70,000 Japanese militarists. This is another serious measure by the American aggressors to violate the Potsdam Proclamation and conspire to reactivate Japanese fascists.
　　The total number of militarists whose purges have been lifted this time is 68,900. After being desequestered, they will be able to hold any public office and openly serve the American aggression policy. These include city, ward, town, and village cadres of fascist organizations such as the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and the "Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps," heads of the general and branch associations of veterans, fascists in economic, news, publishing, and broadcasting circles, members of parliament recommended by Tojo, and all central and local cadres of the fascist organization "Budokukai." Notorious fascists such as former Finance Minister Tanzan Ishibashi and former member of the House of Peers and Privy Councilor Aihiko Kabayama are among those whose purges have been lifted.
　　Not only that, but in order to further massively lift the purges of militarists, the Yoshida reactionary government has already ordered five people, including former Justice Ministry President Shunji Ueta, on the 18th to form a so-called "Public Office Qualification Review Board" to conduct "individual investigations" on those who have not yet been desequestered in order to lift their purges. According to Kyodo News, another 100,000 people will be desequestered before July 10, most of whom are former professional military officers. Notorious fascists such as Ichiro Hatoyama and Jotaro Kawakami may be included in the second batch of desequestered names. At the same time, the Economic and Scientific Bureau of the US military headquarters announced on the 19th the revocation of the 1945 directive restricting the activities of Japanese zaibatsu companies, so that these monopoly organizations can be openly revived.
　　Japanese reactionary parties have indicated that they will "merge" with these desequestered militarists. Koichi Masuda, Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, shamelessly said on the 20th: "Every desequestered person is an extremely promising talent for rebuilding Japan," and the Liberal Party "hopes that a large number of them will join the (Liberal) Party."

　　美帝国主义指使日本吉田反动政府
    非法将近七万名军国主义分子解除整肃
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：根据李奇微的指示，日本吉田反动政府在二十日正式宣布解除将近七万名日本军国主义分子的整肃处分。这是美国侵略者违背波茨坦公告、阴谋起用日本法西斯分子的又一严重措施。
    这次被解除整肃的军国主义分子共计六万八千九百多人。他们在被解除整肃以后，将可担任任何公共职务，公开为美国侵略政策服务。其中包括：法西斯组织“大政翼赞会”、“翼赞壮年团”等的城市、区、町、村干部，在乡军人会总会和分会的负责人，经济界和新闻、出版、广播界等的法西斯分子，东条推荐的国会议员，法西斯团体“武德会”的中央和地方全体干部人员。罪行昭著的法西斯分子前藏相石桥湛山和前贵族院议员、枢密院顾问官桦山爱辅等，都在解除整肃之列。
    不仅如此，吉田反动政府为了进一步大规模解除军国主义分子的整肃，业已在十八日命令前法务府总裁殖田俊吉等五人组成所谓“公职资格审查会”，对尚未被解除整肃者实行“个别调查”，以便解除他们的整肃。据共同社透露，在七月十日以前，将另有十万人被解除整肃，其中大部分是前职业军官。臭名远扬的法西斯分子鸠山一郎、河上丈太郎等都可能列入第二批解除整肃的名单中。与此同时，美军总部经济科学局在十九日宣布撤销一九四五年关于限制日本财阀公司活动的指令，以便这些垄断组织能够公开复活。
    日本反动党派已表示将与这些被解除整肃的军国主义分子“合流”。自由党干事长增田甲子七在二十日无耻地说：“每个被解除整肃者对再建日本都是极有作为的人才”，自由党“希望（他们）有大批人入（自由）党”。
