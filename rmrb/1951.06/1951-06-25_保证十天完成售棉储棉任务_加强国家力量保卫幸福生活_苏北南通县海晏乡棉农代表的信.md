Guarantee Completion of Cotton Selling and Storage Tasks in Ten Days, Strengthen National Power to Defend Happy Life
        ——Letter from Cotton Farmer Representatives of Haiyan Township, Nantong County, Northern Jiangsu

To Chairman Mao:

The "July 1st" this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Our practical action to welcome this great anniversary is to actively mobilize all cotton farmer brothers in the township to sell all the stored cotton to the state and store it in the state bank within ten days.

We are an old cotton-growing area. In the past, we worked hard all year round, and our ten fingers were worn down, but we still couldn't get enough to eat three meals a day. Cotton farmers didn't even have clothes to wear. We know that this is because 90% of the land here was occupied by cotton reclamation companies and landlords in the past. 60% of our hard-earned harvest was plundered by the reactionary cotton reclamation companies and landlords. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries relied on the cotton of their American daddy, so the cotton we grew couldn't be sold for money, and one jin of unginned cotton could only be exchanged for two or three jin of rice.

Since the Communist Party came, the world has changed. With the implementation of land reform, we can cultivate and harvest on our own land. Last year, the government transported good cotton seeds from other places—Dai-character cotton. Our township borrowed more than 90,000 jin. This cotton seedling grows more than one person tall, and each plant has more than ten to fifty cotton bolls. The yield is one-third higher than ordinary cotton. We had a bumper harvest this year, with an average yield of more than 100 jin per mu. This year, the government announced a cotton (medium grade) to grain price ratio of 1:8.5, which makes us very happy! Because each person here has an average of five mu of land, it is estimated that each person has thousands of jin of rice! In the past, our stomachs were full of red grain seedlings and weeds, but now we can eat our fill of rice. Young men and women here are wearing new clothes, and old people in their eighties and nineties are also wearing foreign cloth. There are also a lot of families building houses, with more than 200 new houses built in the township.

With the Communist Party, we can turn ourselves over, so we are willing to enthusiastically respond to the government's call to carry out the patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign. Because selling cotton early can enable textile factories to resume work as soon as possible, and workers can have jobs, which can increase the country's economic strength, strengthen the anti-US and aid-Korea work, fully support the front line, defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible, and defend our happy life.

Now, all of our representatives unanimously guarantee to you:

1. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party, resolutely implement the patriotic pact and respond to the government's call to sell and store cotton. 2. All representatives will take the lead in selling and storing cotton. 3. Actively publicize and mobilize, mobilize all cotton farmer brothers in the township to sell all the stored cotton to the state within ten days.

    保证十天完成售棉储棉任务  加强国家力量保卫幸福生活
        ——苏北南通县海晏乡棉农代表的信毛主席：
    今年“七一”是中国共产党诞生三十周年纪念日，我们迎接这一伟大纪念日的实际行动，就是要积极动员全乡棉农兄弟，在十天以内把所有存棉全部卖给国家和储入国家银行。
    我们这里是老棉区，过去我们这里人一年忙到头十个指头忙秃了，还是一天三顿忙不上嘴，种棉的人连衣服都没得穿。我们知道：这是因为我们这里土地过去有百分之九十为棉垦公司和地主占有，我们终年辛苦的收获有百分之六十为反动的棉垦公司和地主劫夺去了；加之，国民党反动派依靠他美国干爸爸的棉花，所以我们种的棉花卖不到钱，一斤皮花只换到二、三斤大米。
    自从来了共产党，世道就变过来了。实行了土地改革，我们在自己的土地上自种自收，去年政府从外地运来了好棉籽——岱字棉，我们乡里贷到九万多斤。这个棉苗长起来有一人多高，每株有十多个至五十多个棉桃。产量比普通棉花增加三分之一。这一年我们是得到了丰收，每亩平均产量一百多斤。今年政府又公布了一比八·五的棉（中级）粮比价，我们真高兴极了！因为我们这里每人平均有五亩土地，算一下每人都有千斤大米啦！过去我们是满肚子红粮秧草，现在我们可以大米吃饱了。我们这里青年男女们都穿了新衣服，八、九十岁的老人也穿上了洋布。造房子的人家也特别多，全乡新造二百多间。
    有了共产党我们就得翻身，所以我们愿意热烈响应政府号召，开展爱国售棉储棉运动。因为早卖棉花可以使纺织厂早日复工，工人有工做，这样可以增加国家经济力量加强抗美援朝工作，全力支援前线，早日打败美国侵略者，保卫我们的幸福生活。
    现在我们全体代表一致向您保证：
    一、庆祝共产党三十周年纪念，坚决贯彻爱国公约，响应政府售棉储棉号召。二、全体代表带头售棉储棉。三、积极宣传动员，动员全乡棉农兄弟在十天以内把所有存棉全部卖给国家。
