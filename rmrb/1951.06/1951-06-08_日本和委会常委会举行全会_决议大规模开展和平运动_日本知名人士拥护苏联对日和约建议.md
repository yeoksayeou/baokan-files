　　Japan Peace Committee Standing Committee Holds Plenary Session; Resolves to Launch Large-Scale Peace Movement
    Prominent Japanese Figures Support Soviet Proposal for Peace Treaty with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] TASS, 6th: Japan United News reported that the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Supporters Committee held a plenary session on May 30 to discuss the progress of the Japanese peace movement.
    The Standing Committee resolved to actively carry out a signature campaign for the World Peace Council declaration from June 25 to August 7, hold peace gatherings under the slogan of fighting for peace, and organize various conferences, exhibitions, and lectures.
    The Standing Committee also resolved to organize 10,000 local peace committees in various enterprises, schools, and other institutions. By the end of June, meetings of activists fighting for peace will be held in various prefectures, and peace conferences will be held in various prefectures in early August to elect members of the prefectural peace committees. The plenary session also stipulated that the Japan Peace Conference will be held on August 15.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] United Press reported: United Press had consulted some prominent Japanese figures on the "Soviet Government's Opinion on the US Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and the US "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan." The results of the consultation show that most of them support the Soviet proposal, oppose the US draft, and advocate that the occupying forces should withdraw immediately after the peace treaty and oppose rearming Japan. Mr. Takakuwa Sumio, a member of the World Peace Council and a philosopher, said: The problem cannot be solved without signing a comprehensive peace treaty. Japan should not risk signing a separate peace treaty. He said: Foreign troops stationed in Japan after the conclusion of a peace treaty have the danger of turning Japan into a battlefield. Commentator Shigeru Niijima said: In terms of the future of the Japanese people, the Soviet proposal advocating a comprehensive peace treaty is much better than the US draft advocating a separate peace treaty. The Soviet proposal emphasizes the free development of Japan's peaceful economy and eliminates all restrictions on trade, which is the basis for Japan's economic independence. It makes Japan's national independence and peace more secure. The suggestions in the Soviet proposal on withdrawing the occupying forces and restricting Japan's armed forces are in line with the interests of the Japanese people. Commentator Kakuzo Maeshima pointed out that the Soviet proposal is faithful to the Potsdam Proclamation, so it is beneficial to Japan's future. Professor Kenjuro Yanagida of Urawa University said: If a peace treaty is concluded in accordance with the Soviet proposal, Japan will not have to rearm, peace will be guaranteed, independence and freedom can be obtained, and the people's happiness will also be guaranteed. Writer Seikichi Fujimori also believes that "only by adopting the Soviet proposal can Japan's independence and peace be defended."

　　日本和委会常委会举行全会  决议大规模开展和平运动
    日本知名人士拥护苏联对日和约建议
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社六日讯：日本联合通讯社消息，日本拥护和平委员会常任委员会在五月三十日举行全会，讨论关于日本和平运动的进行问题。
    常任委员会决议自六月二十五日至八月七日积极开展征集世界和平理事会宣言的签名运动，在为和平而斗争的口号下举行和平集会，组织各种大会、展览会与演讲等。
    常任委员会又决议在各企业、学校与其他机关中组织一万个地方和平委员会。到六月底，在各县举行为和平而斗争的积极分子的会议，在八月初举行各县和平大会，选举县和平委员会的委员。全会又规定在八月十五日举行日本和平大会。
    【新华社七日讯】联合通讯社消息：联合通讯社曾就“苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书”与美国的“对日和约草案”征询一些日本知名人士的意见。征询的结果表明，他们大多数拥护苏联的提案，反对美国的草案，并主张媾和后占领军应即撤退和反对重新武装日本。世界和平理事会理事、哲学家高桑纯夫表示：不签订全面和约是不能解决问题的。日本不应该冒险签订单独和约。他说：缔结和约后外国驻军日本有使日本变成战场的危险。评论家新岛繁说：就日本人民的前途来讲，主张全面媾和的苏联的提案比主张单独媾和的美国草案要好得多。苏联提案强调日本和平经济的自由发展，取消贸易上的一切限制，这是日本经济自立的基础，它使日本的民族独立与和平更有保障。苏联提案中关于撤退占领军与限制日本武装力量的建议，是符合于日本人民大众的利益的。评论家前芝确三指出：苏联提案是忠实于波茨坦公告的，所以对日本的将来是有利的。浦和大学教授柳田谦十郎说：按照苏联提案媾和的话，日本就不必重整军备，和平有了保证，独立、自由也可获得，人民的幸福也有了保障。作家藤森成吉也认为：“只有采用苏联提案才能保卫日本的独立与和平”。
