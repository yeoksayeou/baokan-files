To the Editor:
The collective tax payment movement in Xixian County, Henan Province, has deepened into the towns. The industrial and commercial circles of Wulongji in the county, after receiving education on resisting America and aiding Korea, have successively established patriotic covenants. When paying business tax for May, the industrial and commercial circles of Wulongji have fulfilled the "no delays and no dragging" condition in their patriotic covenants, and completed it two days ahead of schedule.

The business tax collection for May in Wulongji started on May 25th. With the understanding that "actively paying taxes is resisting America and aiding Korea" and "paying taxes is for oneself," the industrial and commercial circles all took pride in paying first, and no one wanted to lag behind. For example, the 22 trades such as fried dough sticks, noodles, and rough tobacco, were mostly vendors, and they all scrambled to send the tax money directly to the tax bureau. The task of paying taxes was completed within two days, May 20th and 21st. The ten major industries such as groceries, Beijing goods, and iron goods, first paid the tax to the bank, which then transferred the money.

In order to demonstrate the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, the industrial and commercial circles of Wulongji organized a team of more than 600 people at noon on May 23rd to hold a patriotic parade of "Glorious Tax Payment."

　　河南息县集体纳税运动深入集镇编辑同志：
    河南息县集体纳税运动已深入集镇。该县乌龙集工商界，经过抗美援朝教育，先后订立了爱国公约。在缴纳五月份营业税时，乌龙集工商界已实现了自己的爱国公约中的“不拖不拉”的条件，并且提前两天完成了。
    乌龙集五月份营业税于五月二十五日开征。工商界在“踊跃纳税就是抗美援朝”和“缴税为自己”的认识下，都以先缴为荣，谁也不甘落后。如油条、面条、毛烟等二十二业大都是摊贩，都争抢将税款直接送到税局。在五月二十、二十一两天内就完成了纳税任务。杂货、京货、铁货等十大行业，先把税款缴到银行，由银行转账。
    乌龙集工商界，为了显示抗美援朝的力量，在五月二十三日中午组织了一支六百余人的队伍举行了“光荣纳税”的爱国游行。
                                            王茗清、马心善
