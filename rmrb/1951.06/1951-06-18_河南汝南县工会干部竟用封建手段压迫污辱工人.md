    Henan Runan County Trade Union Cadres Actually Use Feudal Methods to Oppress and Humiliate Workers
To the Editor:
    Li Weiliang, a trade union cadre in our county, casually humiliates workers and makes them parade through the streets wearing tall hats, seriously abandoning the position of the working class. The course of events is as follows:
    When the public hospital was building houses in our county seat, because there were few urban workers, a large number of carpenters and mud workers were found in the countryside. The carpenters Qiao Wanchun, Zhang Daoli, Wei Tinglin, and others asked the comrade in charge of supervising the construction of the hospital for leave several times due to illness or serious illness in their families, but they were not approved, so they went home on their own.
    After the workers returned home, Zhang, the section chief of the hospital, negotiated with the General Trade Union, unreasonably proposing: "The return of these three workers affects the completion of our task, and your trade union must bear full responsibility; you should quickly call these three workers back, otherwise we will send someone to arrest them." He also falsely accused the workers of stealing six jin of nails from them (which was not true). Without investigation and research, the County General Trade Union wrote a letter without any principles, calling these three workers back. After receiving the letter, the workers immediately returned to the construction site to resume work. The hospital further coerced the County General Trade Union to severely punish these three workers. Completely losing the position of the working class, the County General Trade Union confusedly sent Li Weiliang (a cadre detached from production), chairman of the Carpentry and Mud Workers' Joint Trade Union, to the construction site to convene a meeting of all workers to discuss the handling of the matter. When Li Weiliang convened a meeting of workers, the workers unanimously opposed punishing these three workers. However, Li Weiliang did not listen to the correct opinions of the workers, but forcibly punished and humiliated the workers. He ordered the three workers to parade through the streets wearing tall green paper hats, with the words "See the Runaway Workers," "Beware of Runaway Workers," and "Educate the Lazy" written on the hats. Li Weiliang also wanted to draw glasses on the workers' faces, but the workers resisted and said, "You can shoot us, but we won't let you draw them!" Only then did they not draw them. During the parade, the three workers walked in front wearing tall hats, and Li Weiliang followed behind menacingly with a pistol in his hand, and someone was beating a gong. Li Weiliang also forced the workers to shout in the street: "I am a runaway worker, don't learn from me..." In this way, the workers were humiliated and forced to parade through four main streets.
    Afterwards, the workers protested one after another, saying: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we workers have turned over, and we are still being humiliated like this, which is absolutely intolerable." Everyone pointed out that such trade union cadres not only cannot speak for the workers and seek their welfare, but instead ride on the workers' necks, flaunting their power and oppressing and humiliating them, fully demonstrating the feudal foreman style and seriously losing their position. The workers demanded that the higher-level trade union and the government strictly handle this issue and give Li Weiliang the legal and administrative sanctions he deserves.

    Editor's Note: The illegal act of the Runan County Trade Union cadres in humiliating workers is extremely vile. As a trade union cadre, to actually use feudal means to oppress workers arbitrarily and unreasonably, can this still be tolerated? It is completely correct for the workers of the county to request the local government to strictly handle this issue. It is hoped that the local government and the higher-level trade union will quickly handle this matter and inform us of the results of the handling.

### 河南汝南县工会干部竟用封建手段压迫污辱工人

    河南汝南县工会干部竟用封建手段压迫污辱工人编辑同志：
    我县工会干部李维良，随便污辱工人，让工人带高帽子游街，严重地丧失了工人阶级的立场。事情的经过是这样的：
    公立医院在我县城内修建房舍时，因城市工人少，曾在乡间找了大批木泥工人。木工乔万春、张道理、魏廷林等三人，因患病或家里有人得了重病，曾向该医院负责监工的同志数次请假，都没有请准，就自己回家了。
    工人回家后，该医院张科长即到总工会交涉，他无理地提出：“这三个工人回去，影响我们的任务不能完成，你们工会须负完全责任；你们应当迅速把这三位工人叫回来，否则我们即派人去抓。”他并且诬陷工人，说工人偷了他们六斤钉子（实际上没有这事）。县总工会不进行调查研究，即毫无原则地写信叫这三位工友回来。工人接信后，随即回到施工地复工。该医院更进一步要挟县总工会，给这三位工友以严重处罚。县总工会完全失掉工人阶级的立场，就糊里糊涂地派木泥业联合工会主席李维良（脱离生产干部），到工地召开全体工人会议，讨论处理办法。当李维良召集工人开会时，到会工人一致反对处罚这三个工友。而李维良却不听工人的正确意见，硬要强制地处罚和污辱工人。他命令这三位工友戴绿纸高帽游街，帽子上面还写着：“请看逃跑工人”，“警戒逃跑工人”，“教育懒汉”等字样。李维良还要给工人脸上画眼镜，工人反抗说：“你枪毙我们也不许画！”这才没有画成。在游街时，三位工友戴着高帽子走在前面，李维良恶狠狠地提着手枪跟在后面，还有人敲着锣。李维良并强迫工人在街上喊着：“我是逃跑工人，大家不要向我学……。”就这样地污辱着工人，强迫工人游了四条大街。
    事后，工人纷纷提出抗议，工人说：“在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们工人翻了身，还叫我们受这种污辱，是绝对不能容忍的。”大家提出，像这样的工会干部，不但不能代表工人说话，替工人谋福利，反而骑在工人的脖子上耀武扬威地压迫污辱工人，充分表现了封建把头作风，严重的丧失了立场。工人们要求上级工会和政府严格地处理这一问题，给李维良以应得的法律和行政处分。

    编者按：汝南县工会干部污辱工人的非法行为，是极端恶劣的。作为一个工会干部，竟用封建手段，横蛮无理地压迫工人，这难道还能容忍吗？该县工人们要求当地政府严格处理这个问题，完全正确。希望当地政府和上级工会迅速处理这件事，并将处理结果告诉我们。
