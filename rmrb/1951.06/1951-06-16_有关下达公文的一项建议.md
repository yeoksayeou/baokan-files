To the Editor:
　　Regarding the issuance of official documents by higher-level organs to lower-level organs under dual leadership, there should be a division of labor and hierarchical regulations. It is truly wasteful for a lower-level organ to receive several documents with the same content simultaneously. Regarding the issue of key allocation plans for the second quarter of the joint directive from the Central Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the Bengbu Branch of the China Salt Company received a total of four identical documents simultaneously from the East China Regional Company, the Anhui North Administrative Office Industry and Commerce Department, the Anhui North Cooperative Headquarters, and the Bengbu Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau. Regarding the directive from the Central Ministry of Trade stipulating three days of preferential salt sales for revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary army families during the Spring Festival, the Bengbu Branch of the China Salt Company also received several identical documents simultaneously from the superior company and departments such as the Administrative Office Industry and Commerce Department and the Bengbu Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau. Sometimes the Financial and Economic Commission system also sends similar instructions, resulting in even more duplication. I believe this is a wasteful phenomenon, and the waste would be significant nationwide. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments should formulate a unified method regarding the issuance of official documents by organs under dual leadership.

### 有关下达公文的一项建议

　　有关下达公文的一项建议编辑同志：
    上级机关对于受双重领导的下级机关发布指示或其他公文时，应有分工分级规定，一个下级机关，同时收到几件同一内容的公文，这实在是一种浪费。关于中央贸易部和全国合作总社联合指示的第二季度的重点配售计划问题，中国盐业公司蚌埠分公司曾同时收到华东区公司，皖北行署工商处，皖北合作总社与蚌埠市人民政府工商局发来的同一公文共四件。关于中央贸易部规定春节优待革命烈士及革命军人家属售盐三天的指示，中国盐业公司蚌埠分公司也收到上级公司及行署工商处，蚌埠市人民政府工商局等部门同时发来的同样公文数份。有时财政经济委员会系统也发来同样的指示，这样重复就更多了。我认为这是一种浪费现象，全国加起来，这种浪费会是很大的。所以我建议有关部门，应规定出一个关于双重领导机关下达公文的统一办法。
