　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st—The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) hosted a banquet on the afternoon of the 31st to bid farewell to Panchen Erdeni and the entire delegation of the Tibetan local government headed by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who are about to leave Beijing. Zhang Jingwu, the representative of the Central People's Government who will accompany the Tibetan local government delegation to Tibet, and the accompanying staff of the Panchen and Tibetan local government delegations were also in attendance.

　　The banquet was presided over by Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. Invited to attend were Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government; Dong Biwu and Chen Yun, Vice Premiers of the Government Administration Council; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission; Peng Zhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; members of the Central People's Government in Beijing; standing committee members and members of the National Committee of the CPPCC in Beijing; members of the Government Administration Council; ministers of the departments of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; heads of commissions, ministries, bureaus, academies, offices, and banks of the Central People's Government; and leaders of democratic parties and people's organizations, totaling more than 330 people.

　　After the banquet began, Vice Chairman Li Jishen spoke first, followed by Panchen and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme. Vice Chairman Li said: The agreement signed between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on the peaceful liberation of Tibet is a historical turning point for the Tibetan nationality to break away from imperialist shackles and return to the great family of the motherland. It is also a historical turning point for the Tibetan nationality to move from internal division to unity and from darkness and suffering to brightness and happiness. This is a great victory for the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people, and also a great victory for the people of the whole country. Therefore, after the announcement of the agreement, it was warmly celebrated and supported by the people of all nationalities throughout the country, especially the Tibetan people. The people of all nationalities across the country are grateful to our great people's leader Chairman Mao, because under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, all minority nationalities who have been oppressed by imperialism and domestic reactionary rule for many years have been liberated, and the Tibetan nationality can return to the great family of the motherland. Vice Chairman Li then said: Panchen Erdeni and the representatives of the Tibetan local government are about to leave Beijing. It is hoped that the forces led by the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni will resolutely implement the entire agreement and strive for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality.

　　In his speech, Panchen said that he was very happy that the issue of the peaceful liberation of Tibet had been successfully resolved, and that he was willing to help the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan local government to strive for the completion of the entire agreement in the future. In his speech, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme firmly stated that after returning to Tibet, he would do his best to realize the agreement.

　　The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of unity, friendship, and joy. The participants frequently toasted to the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, to the peaceful liberation of Tibet, to the unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and to the great unity of the people of all nationalities in China. After the banquet, a wonderful performance was given by the Art Troupe of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, composed of the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Quyi Service Brigade, and the Music Working Group of the Central Conservatory of Music.

　　[Our Newspaper News] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Dalai Lama and Panchen, congratulating them on the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The telegram stated: The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed on May 23, 1951. This is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership. This is another serious failure for the imperialist aggressive forces attempting to obstruct peace!

　　In the past, due to the oppression of the reactionary Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and Chiang Kai-shek, and due to imperialist instigation, there have long been estrangement and disunity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as within the Tibetan nationality. All of this will be permanently eliminated with the signing of the agreement. In the future, in the great family of the motherland, it is firmly believed that the two gentlemen will abandon all past grievances and work together in harmony. The Tibetan people will forever unite, and all nationalities in China will forever unite to strive for the construction of a new Tibet and a new China! The signing of the agreement has liberated the disaster-stricken Tibetan people from the shackles of imperialism and returned them to the great family of the motherland. This is the beginning of a happy life for the Tibetan people. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the workers across the country, extends warm congratulations to the two gentlemen and the Tibetan people!

    全国总工会电达赖和班禅祝贺和平解放西藏协议
    【新华社三十一日讯】中国人民政协全国委员会三十一日下午设宴欢送行将离京的班禅额尔德尼和以阿沛·阿旺晋美为首的西藏地方政府全体代表，与西藏地方政府代表一同赴藏的中央人民政府代表张经武，以及班禅和西藏地方政府代表团的随行工作人员。
    宴会由人民政协全国委员会李济深副主席主持。应邀作陪的有中央人民政府副主席朱德，政务院副总理董必武、陈云，人民政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻，民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉，北京市人民政府市长彭真，以及中央人民政府在京委员，中国人民政协全国委员会在京常务委员、委员，政务院政务委员，人民革命军事委员会各部部长，中央人民政府各委、部、会、院、署、行首长，各民主党派和人民团体的负责人等三百三十余人。
    宴会开始后，首由李济深副主席讲话，班禅和阿沛·阿旺晋美均分别致词。李副主席说：这次中央人民政府和西藏地方政府所签订的关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，是西藏民族脱离帝国主义羁绊，回到伟大祖国大家庭中来的历史转捩点，也是西藏民族由内部分裂走向团结、由黑暗与痛苦走向光明与幸福的历史转捩点。这是西藏民族和西藏人民的伟大胜利，亦即是全国人民的伟大胜利。所以在协议公布后，受到全国各民族人民，特别是藏族人民的热烈庆贺和拥护。全国各民族人民都感谢我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席，因为在毛主席的英明领导下，多年来受帝国主义和国内反动统治压迫的各少数民族才获得解放，西藏民族才能回到伟大的祖国大家庭中来。李副主席接着说：班禅额尔德尼先生和西藏地方政府代表即将离京，希望达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼所领导的力量，都坚决实行全部协议，为西藏的和平解放和西藏民族内部的团结而努力。
    班禅在讲话中说：这次和平解放西藏的问题得到圆满解决，感到非常高兴，今后愿意帮助达赖喇嘛和西藏地方政府为完成全部协议而奋斗。阿沛·阿旺晋美在讲话中坚决表示：回到西藏以后，愿为协议的实现而尽一切努力。
    宴会在团结友好愉快的气氛中进行。与会者频频为中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席的健康、为西藏的和平解放、为达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的团结、为中国各民族人民的大团结而干杯。宴后，由包括中华杂技团、曲艺服务大队、中央音乐学院音乐工作团所组成的中国人民赴朝慰问团总团文艺工作团作精彩的表演。
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会致电达赖和班禅，祝贺关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。电文称：和平解放西藏问题的协议已在一九五一年五月二十三日签字了。这是毛主席英明领导的结果。这是妄图阻挠和平的帝国主义侵略势力又一次的严重的失败！
    过去，由于反动的满清政府、北洋军阀、蒋介石的统治压迫，由于帝国主义的挑拨离间，汉族和西藏民族间以及西藏民族内部长期地存在着隔阂和不团结，这一切随着协议的签订将永远地消除。今后，在祖国的大家庭里，深信两位先生必将尽弃一切旧嫌，和衷共济。西藏人民将永远团结起来，中华各民族将永远团结起来，为建设新西藏，为建设新中国而奋斗！协议的签订，使灾难深重的西藏人民从此解除了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了伟大的祖国大家庭，这是西藏人民幸福生活的开始，中华全国总工会代表全国工人群众，谨向两位先生及西藏人民致以热烈的庆贺！
