    Labor Model Hang Peilan's Letter
　  Talking about the West Lake Workers' Sanatorium
    Comrade Editor:
    After the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, I went to the workers' sanatorium set up by the Shanghai General Trade Union in West Lake for three days of recuperation. Now I will tell you about my life there for those three days.
    There were seventy-six of us in total. We were all advanced producers, labor models, and cadres among the workers. When we arrived in West Lake, we seventy-six people were divided and lived in two sanatoriums on Jing'an Road and Jiu Xi Shi Ba Jian (Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies). The houses in both places were very good; we had never lived in such good houses before. The house in Jiu Xi Shi Ba Jian was on the mountain, and from above, you could see the whole view of West Lake. Zhong Mingyue and I lived in a room on Jing'an Road, and there were two spring beds in the room. The bedsheets were new, with red silk quilts and embroidered pillows. Lying in bed, opening the window, you could see the lake and the woods.
    During the three days, we visited Lingyin Temple, Jiu Xi Shi Ba Jian, and Huxin Pavilion, admired the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, and swam in the lake for half a day. We also visited the more than one hundred mu of land that the National Textile Workers' Union bought in West Lake in the capacity of masters. It was to be used to build a sanatorium for textile workers.
    We sightseeing during the day, and after taking a bath at night, we quietly sat in white rattan chairs to read newspapers, magazines, and pictorials. Some competed in table tennis or chess in the octagonal pavilion or entertainment room, and some sat by the radio listening to music.
    The comrades in the sanatorium took good care of our health. There were many dishes for each meal, such as pork ribs and sweet fermented rice soup with eggs. The sanatorium also had contracted doctors to take care of our health.
    Comrade Editor, our life in those three days was extremely comfortable. How good our workers' lives are after liberation! Each of us felt the happiness of being liberated and the loveliness of New China even more deeply during this recuperation! In the past, how could we workers have had the opportunity to come to West Lake to play? Now we have become the masters of West Lake. The workers who came to recuperate all understood that our ability to come to West Lake for recuperation today is the victorious fruit of countless martyrs who shed their blood. Therefore, this time our sightseeing in West Lake has strengthened our determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and do a good job in production to defend the fruits of victory. In the sanatorium, we held a forum to exchange production experiences. Every advanced producer promised to go back and better lead everyone to do a good job in production. Xu Fengmei from the State-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory said: "When I go back, I will do a good job in group production, unite the masses, and resolutely resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries." We all expressed our determination to thank Chairman Mao with practical actions. Now, I have returned to the factory. In addition to actively leading the female workers to learn from the Ma Hengchang group experience and participate in the patriotic labor competition, I will also do a good job in the factory safety group to protect the factory.

### 劳动模范杭佩兰来信  谈西湖工人休养所

    劳动模范杭佩兰来信
　  谈西湖工人休养所编辑同志：
    劳动保险条例实施后，我曾到上海总工会在西湖设的工人休养所去休养了三天。我现在把那三天的生活情形告诉给你们。
    我们一共去了七十六个人。我们都是工人中的先进生产者、劳动模范和干部。到了西湖，我们七十六个人便分住在静安路和九溪十八涧两个休养所。两处的房子都很好，我们从来没有住过这样好的房子。九溪十八涧的房子是在山上，从上面可以看见西湖的全景。我和钟明月两人住在静安路上的一间房里，房内有两只弹簧床。床上的被单都是新的，红绸被面，绣花枕头。人躺在床上，打开窗子，就可以望见湖水和树林。
    三天中我们游览了灵隐寺、九溪十八涧、湖心亭，观赏了三潭印月，并在湖里游了半天。我们还以主人的身份去看了全国纺织工会在西湖买的一百多亩地基，那是准备给纺织工人修造休养所用的。
    我们白天游览，晚上洗过澡后就安静地坐在白藤椅上看书报、画刊。有的在八角亭里或文娱室里比赛乒乓球或下棋，有的坐在收音机旁收听音乐。
    休养所的同志们对我们的身体照顾得很周到，每顿饭都有很多菜，如排骨，酒酿蛋等。休养所还有特约医生，照顾我们的健康。
    编辑同志，我们这三天生活真是舒服极了，解放以后我们工人的生活多好呵！我们每个人在这次休养中，都更深刻地感觉到了翻身的幸福和新中国的可爱！过去我们工人那有机会到西湖来玩呢？现在我们都做了西湖的主人了。来休养的工人们都明白，我们今天能到西湖来休养，是无数先烈用鲜血换来的胜利果实。因此，这次我们在西湖游览更加坚定了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、搞好生产保卫胜利果实的决心。在休养所中，我们曾召开了一次座谈会，互相交流了生产经验。每个先进生产者都保证回去更好的带动大家，搞好生产。国营上海棉纺织第十六厂徐凤美说：“回去要搞好小组生产，团结群众，坚决抗美援朝和镇压反革命。”我们都表示，决心以实际行动来感谢毛主席。现在，我已经回到工厂了，我除了积极带动女工们学习马恒昌小组经验，参加爱国主义劳动竞赛外，并要搞好工厂安全小组，保护工厂。
