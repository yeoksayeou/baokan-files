　　The Hearts of Korean Children
　　Northwest News Worker Representative of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea  Tian Fang
　　On the third day of our delegation's visit to Korea, we encountered a group of very enthusiastic Korean children in a mountain village in Anju County, South Pyongan Province. They all had the surname Liu and were seven, ten, twelve, and the oldest was no more than sixteen years old. Their school in Anju County was destroyed by enemy aircraft, and the village school had not yet been established. Therefore, they helped their mothers at home with fetching water, chopping firewood, cooking, taking care of younger siblings, or helping with odd jobs in the fields. Most of them were Young Pioneers, and twelve-year-old Yonglin was the leader of the Young Pioneers.
　　Because Volunteer Army comrades had stayed in this village for a period, the children could speak a few words of Chinese and write a few Chinese characters. Therefore, in a short time, we became very close to them. One evening, Yonglin's older sister, Yongshu, saw us packing our bags after dinner, and she guessed that we were leaving. She was a little sad, lowered her head, and thought while touching her red scarf. She said these two sentences in Chinese:
　　"Walk slowly. Watch us sing and dance as we go, okay?" Saying that, she ran out the door. After a while, Yongshu brought fifteen-year-old Yongji, seven-year-old Yongshun, ten-year-old Chunzi, thirteen-year-old Wujian, twelve-year-old Xunni, Yonglin, and a group of other children. They pushed open the paper door in the middle, and first danced a Korean children's dance. Then:
　　"Without the Communist Party, there would be no China..."
　　"The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..."
　　The clear and loud Chinese singing attracted Zakelov (a Uyghur) from the Xinjiang ethnic minority representative, Professor Lei Jieqiong from the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Professor Wu Zuxiang from the Beijing Educational Workers' Union, and others who lived next door. They wondered where these Chinese children singing came from. When they understood the situation and saw this moving scene, they were so fascinated and moved! The children sang one after another, danced one after another. Applause was mixed with constant praise. In such a remote rural area, such a group of children with excellent artistic education warmly welcomed us.
　　"You Are the Lighthouse," "Ode to Laborers," "Song of General Kim Il-sung," "Nursery Rhyme Dance," "The White-Haired Girl," "Democratic Korea" (song and dance), "Our Motherland," "Spring" (dance), "Mongolian Dance," "By the Nakdong River," "Korean Folk Song" (with dance), "Solo Dance," "Song of the Young Pioneers," "Ukrainian Dance," "He Who Does Not Work Shall Not Eat," "Lullaby" (with dance), "The Working People Are the Vanguard," "March of the Korean People's Army"... We enjoyed a full twenty beautiful programs. It was getting dark, and the children's enthusiasm moved the representatives so much that they simply didn't know how to thank them for their kindness. So, everyone reached into their pockets to see if there was anything worth giving as a gift. So, the pens they carried with them, small mirrors, Chairman Mao's pictures, commemorative badges... were all taken out. "Okay! Children! Let us give these to you as a souvenir!" The children bowed one by one to accept our gifts. Especially the children who received Chairman Mao's pictures and commemorative badges shouted with special pride:
　　"Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" They cherished the pictures and badges deeply,贴ing them on their chests.
　　Coincidentally, due to a temporary accident, we were leaving tomorrow. The children were even happier and prepared to perform even better for us tomorrow.
　　The next day, the early spring sunshine warmly filled the entire courtyard. The children changed into their dancing clothes, which they only wore on holidays, red, white, green, silk, and gauze. Although the programs performed were still the same as last night, the scene, audience, and atmosphere were obviously more moving than last night.
　　In such a cruel war, why did the Korean children welcome the representatives of the Chinese people so enthusiastically? The landlord, through the translation comrade, told us:
　　In a primary school in Anju County, there was a female teacher who taught many elementary school students, like this group of children, who could sing and dance. The bestial enemy aircraft destroyed this school. Many children were killed. Take little Xunni here, for example, her dance is the most beautiful. She not only lost her school and her close dance partners, but even her most beloved parents were taken away by enemy aircraft. She now has to live in her uncle's house. She didn't cry. She already understands the hatred for the enemy, and she also understands the friendship for the great Chinese people. Therefore, she is just as happy as everyone else today, performing wonderful programs to welcome the representatives of the Chinese people.
　　After the song and dance performance ended, the children went back to helping their fathers and mothers with work. Planting soybeans, carrying manure, washing clothes... In the evening, we were really leaving, so the children gathered again. They held our hands and sent us off, all the way to the roadside at the entrance of the village.
　　"Ah yo! All gone! Big miss!"
　　"Beat down the American thieves and go see China, okay?"
　　The children could already speak a lot of Chinese. Although they still gestured to supplement their inner feelings.
　　Shake hands, shake hands, again and again, like our own younger brothers and sisters, like our own sons and daughters. For the sake of your new generation, the new generation of Korea, your own country, and all mankind, we have a responsibility to support you, and we can no longer let the beasts devour you.
　　"Okay, go back! We'll come back to see you when we return!"
　　The car's engine roared, and the wheels turned. The children stood up straight, and another clear and loud singing resounded through the night sky, sending us all the way out of the winding mountain gully. (Attached pictures)

### 朝鲜孩子们的心

　　朝鲜孩子们的心
    中国人民赴朝慰问团西北新闻工作者代表  田方
    当我们赴朝慰问团进入朝鲜的第三天，在平安南道安州郡一个山村中，遇到了一群非常热情的朝鲜孩子，她们都姓刘，有七岁、十岁、十二岁的，最大的也不过十六岁。她们在安州郡城里的学校被敌机炸毁了，乡里的学校还没办起来，因此，她们就在家里帮助妈妈顶水、砍柴、作饭、带小弟弟，或者在地里帮做一些零活。她们大多是少年先锋队队员，十二岁的永林是少先队的小队长。
    因为志愿军同志在这村里住了一个时期，所以孩子们多能讲几句中国话，写几个中国字。因此，在短短的时间内，和我们也混得很亲热了。一天傍晚，永林的姐姐永淑看到我们吃过晚饭后在打背包，她猜测我们要走了。她有些难过，垂下了头，手摸着红领巾在思考。她说了这样两句中国话：
    “你们慢慢地走。看看我们唱唱、跳跳的走，好吗？”说着，她跑出门去。不一会，永淑引来了十五岁的永姬，七岁的永顺，十岁的春子，十三岁的妩键，十二岁的?婫和永林，还有一群别的孩子。她们推开了当中的纸壁门，首先跳了一个朝鲜儿童舞。接着：
    “没有共产党就没有中国……”
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”
    清脆、响亮的中国歌声，把住在隔壁的新疆兄弟民族代表扎克洛夫（维吾尔族）、中国民主促进会代表雷洁琼教授，北京市教育工作者工会代表吴组缃教授等也吸引来了。他们奇怪那儿来的中国小孩在歌唱。当他们明白了这个情形，和看到了这个动人的场面后，是多么神往、感动呀！孩子们唱了一个又一个，跳了一个又一个。鼓掌声里夹着不绝的赞美声。在这么一个偏僻的农村里，这样一群有优秀的艺术教养的孩子，如此热情地欢迎了我们。
    《你是灯塔》、《劳动者颂》、《金日成将军之歌》、《童谣舞》、《白毛女》、《民主朝鲜》（歌舞）、《我们的祖国》、《春》（舞）、《蒙古舞》、《洛东江边》、《朝鲜民歌》（伴舞）、《单人舞》、《少年队之歌》、《乌克兰舞》、《不劳动者不得食》、《催眠曲》（伴舞）、《劳动人民是先锋》、《朝鲜人民军进行曲》……我们足足欣赏了二十个优美的节目。天黑了，孩子们的热情，感动得代表们简直不知道怎样来答谢她们的厚谊。于是，各人都掏掏口袋，看有什么值得赠送的东西。于是，随身带的钢笔，小镜子，毛主席的像片，纪念章……都拿出来。“好吧！孩子们！让我们送给你们作个纪念吧！”孩子们一个个鞠着躬接受了我们的礼物。特别是拿到毛主席像片和纪念章的孩子，分外骄傲地叫着：
    “毛泽东！毛泽东！”他们把像片和纪念章贴在自己的胸前深深的心爱着。
    凑巧，由于临时发生事故，我们要明天出发了。孩子们更乐了，准备明天更像样地给我们表演。
    第二天，初春的阳光温暖地照满了整个院子。孩子们换上了她们节日才穿的跳舞衣裳，红的、白的、绿的、绸质的，纱质的。表演的节目虽然仍是昨晚那几个，但是场面、观众、气氛显然比昨晚来得更动人了。
    在这样残酷的战争中，朝鲜孩子为什么这样热情地欢迎中国人民的代表呢？房东经过翻译同志告诉我们：
    在安州郡城里的一个小学校内，有一位女教员，曾经教会了许多像这群孩子一样会歌舞的小学生。兽性的敌机把这个学校炸毁了。许多孩子被炸死了。就拿这里的小?婫来说，她的舞跳得最美。她不仅失去了学校和她亲密的舞伴，连她最亲爱的爸爸妈妈也被敌机夺去了。她现在只得寄居在叔叔家里。她没有哭，她已经懂得了对敌人的仇恨，她也懂得了对于伟大中国人民的友好。因此，他今天和大家同样的高兴，表演了精彩的节目，来欢迎中国人民的代表。
    歌舞场面结束以后，孩子们又帮助父亲母亲干活去了。种大豆，抬粪土，洗衣裳，……。傍晚，我们真的要走了，于是孩子们又聚集起来了。拉着我们的手，送，送，一直送到村口大路边。
    “啊哟！统统的走了！大大的想啊！”
    “打倒了美贼去看看中国，好吗？”
    孩子们已经能讲好多中国话了。虽然她们还比划着手势，来补充她们内心的感情。
    握手，握手，一次又一次，好比自己的弟弟和妹妹，好比自己的儿子和女儿。为了你们新生的一代，朝鲜的、自己祖国的、全人类的新生的一代，我们有责任来支援你们，再也不能让野兽们来吞噬你们。
    “好吧，回去吧！我们回来时再来看你们！”
    汽车的油门开响了，车轮转动了。孩子们站齐立正，又一阵清脆响亮的歌声响彻夜空，一直把我们送出拐弯的小山沟。（附图片）
