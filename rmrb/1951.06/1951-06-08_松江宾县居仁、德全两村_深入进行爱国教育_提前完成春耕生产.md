Songjiang Province, Bin County, Juren and Dequan Villages

Deepen Patriotic Education, Complete Spring Ploughing and Production Ahead of Schedule

Juren and Dequan Villages in Bin County, Songjiang Province, have deeply carried out patriotic ideological education, and the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses has soared unprecedentedly, completing spring ploughing and production ahead of schedule. At the beginning of this year's spring ploughing, the CCP branches in the two villages, in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, organized peasants to denounce the crimes of the US-Chiang clique, comparing the painful life of the old society with the democratic and free life of the new society. They compared the regime, army, and cadres of the new China and its position in the world with the old China, and compared their own new lives of eating, clothing, housing, family business, learning culture, and freedom of marriage with the painful lives of poverty and oppression in the past. From the comparison, the peasant masses deeply realized the infinite greatness and loveliness of the motherland. For example, after the peasants in Yongxing Village made the comparison, they were all moved and said: "Now we have truly straightened our backs and become the masters of the country; the beautiful future belongs to us, who can not work hard to produce!" At the denunciation meetings, the peasants recalled the fourteen years of slave life under the puppet Manchurian rule. They concentrated their greatest hatred on the instigator of the war of aggression—US imperialism. For example, an old woman named Han in Dequan Village said with gritted teeth at the denunciation meeting: "Damn American devils, they want to collude with the Japanese devils to come again. Don't say we have guns now, even if we don't have guns, we will beat them back with sticks! We can't suffer that anymore!" Based on the peasant masses' love for the motherland and hatred for US imperialism, the village leaders immediately explained the significance of the patriotic production increase movement to the peasants, telling them that the patriotic production increase movement is to use patriotic enthusiasm for production, so that the peasants realize that hard work in production is not only for a good life, but also for national construction, for Resist America, Aid Korea, and for defending world peace. Then, in conjunction with the anti-American demonstration parade on May 1st Labor Day, they launched various villages to sign patriotic pledges to carry out the production increase movement. Each production team formulated its own patriotic production increase plan. After carrying out patriotic ideological education, the patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants in the two villages turned into practical actions for hard work in production. For example, after peasant Chi Guifang in Juren Village was educated at the propagandist meeting, he plowed one hectare and five mu of land in one day. After Hou, an old woman from Fengman Village in Dequan Village, participated in the May 1st Labor Day demonstration parade, she hurried to fertilize four mu of land that night. Yongxing Village in Juren Village proposed during the "May 1st" parade: "Move the parade to the fields and use the energy to produce to resist US aggression and aid Korea!" At the beginning of spring ploughing, there was not a single idle laborer or livestock in the whole village. When Wang Wenxue's mutual aid team in the village was plowing the land, they missed half a day of work due to wind. In order to complete the patriotic production increase plan, they made up for it by starting early and working late. This year's spring ploughing in Juren and Dequan Villages, from the beginning of plowing to the completion of sowing, was shortened by more than ten days compared to last year.

While carrying out patriotic education and launching the production increase movement, the two villages also paid attention to implementing production policies and increasing production guidelines, proposing to plant more commercial grain and pay attention to improving agricultural technology, enriching the specific content of the production increase movement. Juren Village originally planned to plant 225 hectares of soybeans, but the result was increased to 355 hectares. In terms of agricultural technology, many farmers in the two villages have learned methods of seed selection, soil improvement, and scientific fertilization. Therefore, this year's spring ploughing production in the two villages is not only completed earlier than last year, but the intensive farming has greatly exceeded last year's.

　　松江宾县居仁、德全两村
    深入进行爱国教育  提前完成春耕生产
    松江省宾县居仁、德全两村，深入进行了爱国主义思想教育，农民群众生产热情空前高涨，春耕生产提早完成。今年春耕开始时，该两村中共支部曾结合抗美援朝运动，组织农民控诉美蒋罪行，以旧社会的痛苦生活和新社会的民主自由生活对比。以新中国的政权、军队、干部及其在世界上的地位与旧中国对比，又把自己的吃、穿、住、家业、学文化、婚姻自由等新的生活和过去贫困、受压迫的痛苦生活作对比。从对比中，农民群众深刻体会到祖国的无比伟大和可爱。如永兴屯的农民们经过对比后，都感动地说：“如今我们真正直起腰来了，真正成了国家的主人；将来美好的前程都是我们的，谁还能不使劲生产呢！”在控诉会上，农民们都回忆起在伪满统治下十四年的奴隶生活。他们把最大的仇恨都集中到侵略战争的发动者——美帝国主义身上。如德全村一位韩老太太，在控诉会上咬牙切齿地说：“该死的美国鬼子，它想拉拢日本鬼子再来，别说咱们现在有了枪，就是没有枪，拿棒子也得把它打回去！咱们可不能再受那个气！”在农民群众这样热爱祖国与痛恨美帝国主义的思想基础上，村领导干部即向农民说明爱国丰产运动的意义，告诉农民爱国丰产运动就是把爱国劲头使用到生产上去，使农民认识到努力生产不仅是为了过好日子，同时也是为了国家的建设，为了抗美援朝，为了保卫世界和平。接着，又结合了“五一”劳动节的反美示威游行，发动各屯订立开展丰产运动的爱国公约。各生产小组订立本组的爱国丰产计划。在进行爱国思想教育之后，两村农民的爱国热情变成了努力生产的实际行动。如居仁村农民池贵方在宣传员会上受到教育之后，一天翻了一垧五亩地。德全村丰满屯侯老太太参加了“五一”劳动节的示威游行回来，当天黑夜就赶着起了四亩地的粪。居仁村永兴屯在“五一”游行时提出“把游行队伍开到地里去，把劲头用到生产上来抗美援朝！”春耕开始时，全屯没有一个闲劳力和闲畜力。该屯王文学互助组犁地时因刮风误了半天工，为完成爱国丰产计划，起早贪黑地补上了。居仁、德全两村今年的春耕，从开犁到下完种，比去年缩短了十几天的时间。
    在进行爱国主义教育，发动丰产运动的时候，该两村并注意贯彻执行了生产政策和增产方针，提出多种商品粮与注意提高农作技术，充实了丰产运动的具体内容。居仁村原计划种大豆二百二十五垧，结果增加到三百五十五垧。在农业技术上，两村的许多农民都学会了选种、改良土壤、科学施肥的办法。因此，该两村今年的春耕生产，不但比去年完成得早，精耕细作方面已大大超过了去年。
