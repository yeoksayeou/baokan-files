How the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Educated Everyone in the Region About the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign
　　Ping Quan, Xiao Wen

　　The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei has ensured that everyone in the area has received patriotic education during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the region has grown unprecedentedly. From April 11th, out of the 4,024,393 people in the entire prefecture, whether in rural or urban areas, adults or children, all those capable of receiving Resist America, Aid Korea education were drawn into the great movement. A total of 1,353,345 people in the region held rallies to denounce the atrocities of Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, arousing unparalleled hatred for the enemy. After this kind of tearful denunciation, the political consciousness of the broad masses of people was greatly enhanced, and they deeply realized that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. After the denunciation meeting, all eleven families of volunteer soldiers in Yangjiagou Village, Qianxi County, wrote letters to their sons or husbands on the Korean front, encouraging their children or husbands to bravely kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds. On the basis of arousing strong hatred for American imperialism, 2,939,946 people in the region (73.2% of the total population) signed petitions to support the conclusion of a peace pact and voted against the American arming of Japan. In Leting County, the number of people who signed and voted accounted for 84.3% of the total population of the county. At the signing and voting rallies, everyone expressed their determination to fight. An old woman from Dongliuzhuang, District One, Luan County, raised both hands and said loudly: "I raise both hands: one hand is to express support for peace and opposition to the arming of Japan; the other hand is to sign up my grandson to join the volunteer army and go to the Korean front to fight the American devils!"

　　In this movement, the broad masses of people realized that they must unite closely, persist in the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle, and carry this struggle through to their daily work. Thus, a movement to establish patriotic pacts was launched throughout the region. At this time, whether they were Communist Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, militiamen, or women, whether they were workers, farmers, industrialists, businessmen, or ethnic minorities, they all formulated patriotic pacts based on their own circumstances. According to incomplete statistics, out of the 6,369 administrative villages in the region, 4,981 villages have established patriotic pacts, accounting for 78.2% of the total number of villages. In Haiyang Town, Linyu County, 743 out of 762 households have established patriotic pacts.

　　On International Labor Day on May 1st, in every town and village in the entire prefecture, young people, old people, women, children, and honorably discharged soldiers who had been seriously wounded formed huge parades and demonstrations. A total of 2,472,974 people (including 842,675 women) participated in the parades and demonstrations in the region, accounting for 61.6% of the total population. In Qianxi County, 118,157 people (including 48,065 women) participated, accounting for 63% of the total population of the county. In Leting County, more than 25,600 women over the age of forty participated in the parade; in the fourth district of the county, 1,109 women participated in the parade with their children in their arms. In Panjiayu Village, which shocked the country ten years ago due to the Japanese invaders' brutal burning, killing, and looting, 620 out of a total of 1,014 people participated in the parade. Everyone also swore an oath next to the "Tomb of a Thousand People" who were killed by the Japanese invaders, resolutely opposed the American arming of Japan, and put forward concrete measures: (1) Guarantee an increase of 7 jin of grain per mu; exceed the original planned cotton planting area by more than half; (2) Rename the village's primary school as "Revenge Primary School" to make their children forever remember this blood debt and grow up to defend the motherland; (3) Women should develop sideline production to increase national wealth. Fishermen and militiamen from 24 villages including Daqinghe in Leting organized more than 90 boats to parade and demonstrate at sea, and swore: "One hand holding a fishing net and the other holding a gun, resolutely defend the coast!"

　　Because the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has been carried out extensively and deeply, the problems that had not been solved in the past, such as the contradiction between this central task and that central task, and between central tasks and departmental work, have also been basically solved this time. In the early stages of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, some responsible cadres of county and district Party committees believed that "the area is large, the time is short, there are few cadres, and there is a lot of work," and they were afraid that it would be difficult to complete the task. Some said, "If we make such a fuss about Resist America, Aid Korea, it will squeeze out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries." Others said, "Expanding cotton fields is not guaranteed either." Still others asked, "If everyone is doing Resist America, Aid Korea, who will do other work?" But after the movement was launched, everything changed, and the cadres' thinking and working style also underwent fundamental changes. The cadres all said happily: "I have been working for so many years, I have not only never done such work, I have never even seen it. This has solved so many problems at once!"

　　This new change can be seen more clearly from the following practical examples:

　　The first example: Expanding cotton fields was one of the central tasks in April. Originally, some people were afraid that after the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched, it would be difficult to complete the plan of planting 600,000 mu of cotton in the region. In fact, under the slogan "Resist America, Aid Korea, plant cotton, benefit yourself, and contribute to the country," the entire plan was completed on schedule. In this movement, regardless of whether there were cotton planting habits in the area, as long as they had undergone Resist America, Aid Korea education, they quickly expanded cotton fields. Dongguan Village, District One, Fengrun, originally planned to plant 80 mu of cotton, but exceeded the original plan by 70 mu.

　　The second example: After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was widely carried out throughout the region, a movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched. Everywhere, farmers denounced the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. In Fuling, Linyu, Fengrun, Luannan, Yutian, and other five counties, 525 counter-revolutionary elements were reported by the masses in half a month. Qianxi, Zunhua, and Luannan counties received 348 letters secretly reporting counter-revolutionary elements. Liu Guodong of Shiquanzhuang, District Seven, Fengnan, sold the straw bricks for building a house to pay for the travel expenses to Tangshan and Kaiping to capture the counter-revolutionary criminals who killed his son in order to avenge his son. In this way, counter-revolutionary elements naturally could not escape the law. Zhou Fengyi, a Kuomintang secret agent chief in Fengrun who killed many people, had been hiding in Changli Chengguan for three years, but was also reported by the masses this time. As old woman Han of Haiyang Town, Linyu, said: "Everyone comes to report counter-revolutionary elements, and not a single counter-revolutionary element can escape!"

　　The third example: The work efficiency of cadres working in Party, government, and people's organization organs has greatly improved. In particular, some passive elements are now also actively working. And actively leading and participating in Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education work. As a result, 7,518 propagandists were quickly established throughout the region, 210 reading groups were established, 4,226 blackboard newspapers were established, and 4,449 human-powered broadcasting groups were established. In addition, patriotic production competitions were launched in factories; industrial and commercial enterprises paid taxes in advance; the supply and marketing business of cooperatives made great progress, and more than 50,000 new members were developed. Wherever this vigorous and great movement is carried out, it changes the face of that place.

　　How did the unprecedented and vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Tangshan Prefecture unfold? This is mainly because the Tangshan local Party's policy is clear, the plan is specific, the forces are concentrated, and the steps are consistent. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a work plan based on the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Committee and the situation in the region. In order to realize this plan, various erroneous ideas that hindered the development of this movement were criticized. The county Party committees of each county and the departments of the prefecture also made serious discussions and specific arrangements for this. Under the leadership of the Party, the role of the Party and non-Party propaganda teams of more than 400,000 people at the prefecture, county, district, and village levels was brought into play. This is the propaganda of local work cadres going to the countryside, the propaganda of organ cadres stationed in the area, the reports of reporters at the prefecture, county, and district levels, the extensive propaganda of Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, propagandists, primary and secondary school teachers, and primary and secondary school students throughout the region, and the performances of literary and artistic propaganda teams, rural drama troupes, shadow puppet societies, big drum groups, and magic lantern shows throughout the region. There were a total of 149,143 various propagandas and performances, so that every person in the region who should be educated received two to six propaganda education. In addition, the propaganda of cooperative representatives, labor models, traders, doctors, etc., although there are no statistics, also played a great role.

　　Secondly, the Party organizations at all levels have learned the working method of combining political struggle with economic struggle. In the past, many Party committees and Party member cadres only paid attention to the economic interests of the masses and neglected the political demands of the masses. This problem has been fundamentally solved in this movement. The Fuling County Party Committee said in its report: When we planted cotton last year, we put forward the slogan "To get rich, plant cotton," and "To get rich, plant three whites," and we reported hundreds of thousands of mu of cotton based purely on economic considerations. After inspection, we found that only 60,000 mu were planted. This year, under the leadership of the prefectural committee, after publicizing the slogan "Resist America, Aid Korea, plant cotton, benefit yourself, and contribute to the country," because the national interest was combined with the interests of the masses, the task was completed quickly.

　　Third, propaganda methods and methods such as "contracting" at each level, large-scale publicity meetings, small-scale forums, and individual visits were adopted. The prefectural committee first contracted with each county, the county party committee contracted with each district, and the district and village propaganda forces contracted to the villages, households, and people. The entire Qianxi County is mountainous, especially the third district and parts of the first, second, and fourth districts are the most remote. Therefore, the county decided to focus on these areas, established a mountain Resist America, Aid Korea headquarters, and County Party Secretary Wei Jianhua and other comrades personally led 80 cadres to work, contracting the propaganda and education tasks in every corner of the mountain village. This time, cadres went to mountain villages and small villages that cadres had not been to or rarely went to for many years. Cadres climbed mountains and ridges to deliver the major affairs of Resist America, Aid Korea to the doors of farmers' homes. Luannan organized a group of Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and female teachers, female students, and other propaganda forces to contract the propaganda and education work for women. In terms of propaganda methods, the combination of large and small meetings and individual visits was adopted. When Chengguan, Changli, held a meeting on Shuncheng Street, the number of people attending accounted for 62% of the total number of people. After the meeting, the entire street was divided into three small areas, and each area was divided into seven groups to convene people who had not attended to conduct discussions; but there were still eleven people who did not participate. Finally, the method of individual visits was used to ensure that everyone in the area received education.

　　Fourth, the propaganda policy of mobilizing and organizing the masses to oppose the American arming of Japan proposed by the higher Party committee was correctly implemented; and the method of small-scale denunciation meetings was adopted to arouse the masses' hatred for the enemy and improve the masses' political consciousness. The people of Tangshan Prefecture suffered cruel burning, killing, rape, and looting by the Japanese invaders during the Japanese rule. This deep-seated hatred is still fresh in everyone's memory; when they heard that the United States was going to arm Japan again, the people's old and new hatred immediately merged together, producing a huge force, which was manifested in various practical actions.

　　中共唐山地委怎样使全区每一个人都受到了抗美援朝教育
    平权　萧文
    中共河北唐山地委，在抗美援朝运动中，已使该区每一处每一人都受到了爱国主义教育。全区人民爱国热情空前增长。从四月十一日起，全专区四百零二万四千三百九十三人中，无论在乡村还是城镇，无论是成人还是儿童，所有能够接受抗美援朝教育的人，都卷入了抗美援朝的伟大运动中。全区有一百三十五万三千三百四十五人，分别举行了控诉日本帝国主义、美国帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的暴行大会，激起了对敌人无比的仇恨。广大人民经过这种血泪的控诉后，政治觉悟大大提高，深刻认识到美国帝国主义是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。迁西县杨家沟全村十一户志愿军战士家属，在控诉会后，都给在朝鲜前线的儿子或丈夫写信，鼓励自己的子弟或丈夫英勇杀敌立功。在激发起对美帝国主义强烈仇恨的基础上，全区有二百九十三万九千九百四十六人（占总人口的百分之七十三点二），签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本。乐亭县签名投票的人数占全县总人口的百分之八十四点三。在签名投票的大会上，每个人都表示了斗争的决心。滦县一区东刘庄一位老大娘举起双手大声地说：“我举两只手：一只手是表示拥护和平，反对武装日本；一只手是替我孙子报名参加志愿军，到朝鲜前线去打美国鬼子！”
    在这一运动中，广大人民认识到必须紧密地团结起来，坚持抗美援朝斗争，并把这个斗争贯彻到日常工作中去。于是全区掀起了订立爱国公约运动。这时，不论是共产党员、青年团员和民兵、妇女，不论是工人、农民、工商界和少数民族，都纷纷根据本身情况，制订了爱国公约。据不完全统计，全区六千三百六十九个行政村中，已有四千九百八十一个村订立了爱国公约，占整个村数百分之七十八点二。临榆县海阳镇七百六十二户，就有七百四十三户订立了爱国公约。
    “五一”国际劳动节那天，全专区的每个城镇和乡村，青年、老年、妇女、儿童，以及受过重伤的荣誉军人，结成了巨大的游行示威行列。全区参加游行示威的共有二百四十七万二千九百七十四人（内妇女八十四万二千六百七十五人），占总人口的百分之六十一点六。迁西县有十一万八千一百五十七人（女四万八千零六十五人）参加，占全县总人口百分之六十三。乐亭县四十岁以上的妇女参加游行的有二万五千六百余名；该县第四区抱着小孩参加游行的妇女有一千一百零九名。十年前因惨遭日寇烧杀劫掠而震动全国的潘家峪村，共一千零十四人中，就有六百二十人参加了游行。大家还在被日寇杀害的“千人坟”旁宣誓，坚决反对美国武装日本，并提出具体办法：（一）保证每亩地增产七斤粮食；把原计划植棉亩数超过一半；（二）把村中的小学改名为“复仇小学”，让自己的孩子永远记住这笔血债，长大了保卫祖国；（三）妇女要发展副业生产，增加国家财富。乐亭大清河等二十四个村的渔民和民兵，组织了九十多只船在海上游行示威，并宣誓：“一手渔网一手枪，坚决保卫海防！”
    由于抗美援朝运动开展得广泛与深入，过去工作中一直未能解决的问题，如这一中心工作与那一中心工作、中心工作与部门工作的矛盾问题，这次也得到了基本的解决。在抗美援朝运动初期，曾有些县、区党委的负责干部认为：“地区大，时间短，干部少，工作多”，恐怕难以完成任务。有的则说：“这样闹抗美援朝，就会把镇压反革命工作挤掉。”又有的说：“扩大棉田也不保险。”还有的问：“都搞抗美援朝，谁搞其他工作？”但运动开展以后，一切都随着转变了，干部的思想和工作作风也有了根本的转变。干部都高兴地说：“我工作了这么多年，不但没有作过这样的工作，连见都没有见过。这一下子多少问题都解决了！”
    这种新的变化，从下面几个实际例子中，看得更加明显：
    第一个例子：扩大棉田是四月份中心工作之一。原来有些人怕开展抗美援朝运动后，就难以完成全区种棉六十万亩的计划。事实上，在“抗美援朝种棉花，利在自己，功在国家”的口号下，全部按期完成了。在这一运动中，不论有无种棉习惯的地区，只要经过了抗美援朝教育，就很快扩大了棉田。丰润一区东关村原计划种八十亩棉花，结果超过原计划七十亩。
    第二个例子：全区抗美援朝运动普遍开展后，随着掀起了镇压反革命运动。到处有农民控诉反革命分子的罪恶。抚宁、临榆、丰润、滦南、玉田等五个县，半个月内，经群众检举的反革命分子就有五百二十五名。迁西、遵化、滦南三个县收到密告反革命分子的信件三百四十八封。丰南七区石全庄刘国栋，为了给儿子报仇，把盖房的草坯卖了当路费，到唐山、开平去捉拿杀害他儿子的反革命罪犯。这样，反革命分子自然难逃法网。丰润有个杀人很多的敌伪特务队长周凤仪，隐藏在昌黎城关三年，这次也被群众检举出来了。正如临榆海阳镇韩老大娘说的：“大家都来检举反革命分子，反革命分子就一个也跑不了！”
    第三个例子：在党、政府和人民团体机关中工作的干部，工作效率大大提高了。特别是一些消极分子，现在工作也积极起来。而且积极领导与参加抗美援朝宣传教育工作。全区因此迅速设立了七千五百一十八名宣传员，建立了读报组二百一十组，黑板报四千二百二十六块，人力广播组四千四百四十九个。此外，在工厂中开展了爱国丰产竞赛；工商业提前缴税；合作社供销业务得到了巨大的进展，又发展社员五万余名。这一轰轰烈烈的伟大运动开展到那里，就把那里的面貌改变了。
    唐山专区的空前轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动是怎样开展起来的呢？这主要是唐山地方党的方针明确，计划具体，力量集中，步调一致。中共唐山地委根据河北省委指示和本区情况，制订了工作计划。为了实现这一计划，曾经批判了妨碍开展这一运动的各种错误思想。各县县委和专区各部门对此也都作了认真的讨论和具体的布置。在党的领导下发挥了专区、县、区、村四十余万人的党与非党宣传队伍的作用。这就是地方工作干部的下乡宣传，机关干部的驻地宣传，专区、县、区三级报告员的报告，全区党员、青年团员、宣传员、中小学教员、中小学学生的广泛宣传与全区的文艺宣传队、农村剧团、皮影社、大鼓组、幻灯等的演出。各种宣传与演出共有十四万九千一百四十三次，使全区应受教育的人民，每人受到两次至六次宣传教育。还有合作社代表、劳动模范、交易员、医生等的宣传，虽然没有数字统计，但也起了很大作用。
    其次，各级党组织学会了把政治斗争与经济斗争结合起来的工作方法。过去，很多党委和党员干部只是注意群众的经济利益，而忽略群众的政治要求。这个问题，在这次运动中得到了根本的解决。抚宁县委在汇报中说：去年种棉时我们提出“要发家，种棉花”、“要发财，种三白”的口号，单纯从经济观点出发，上报种棉数十万亩，经过检查才发现只种了六万亩。今年在地委的领导下，宣传了“抗美援朝种棉花，利在自己、功在国家”的口号后，由于把国家利益与群众利益结合起来了，所以完成任务很快。
    第三、采取了逐级“包干”、大会宣传、小会座谈、个别访问等宣传方法与方式。地委首先包起了各县，县委包起了各区，区、村宣传力量包到村、户、人。迁西全县是山区，特别是三区及一、二、四区一部最为偏僻，因此该县确定以这些地区为重点，成立了山地抗美援朝指挥部，并由县委书记魏建华等同志亲自带领八十名干部前往工作，包起了山村各个角落的宣传教育任务。数年来，干部没有到过或轻易不到的山沟小村，这次干部都走到了。干部爬山越岭把抗美援朝的大事送上农民家门去。滦南组织了一部分党员、青年团员，和女教员、女学生及其他宣传力量，包起了对妇女的宣传教育工作。在宣传方式上，并使大、小会宣传与个别访问相结合。昌黎城关在顺城街召开大会时，到会的人数占总人数百分之六十二。会后把全街又划分三个小片，每片又划分七个小组，分别召集没有到会的人进行座谈；但仍有十一人没参加，最后用个别访问的方法，作到了全区每一人都受到教育。
    第四、正确地执行了上级党委提出的动员组织群众反对美国武装日本的宣传方针；并采取了小型控诉会的方式，激发群众对敌仇恨，提高了群众政治觉悟。唐山专区的人民，在日寇统治时期，曾遭受过日寇残酷的烧杀、奸淫和抢掠，这种血海深仇，每个人的记忆犹新；当听到美国又要武装日本的时候，人民的旧仇新恨马上溶化在一起，产生了巨大的力量，在各种实际行动中表现出来。
