　　CCP Anyang Prefectural Committee Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary School
    Corrects the Deviation of Neglecting Political Education
    Our Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary School, under the Anyang Prefectural Committee of the CCP Pingyuan Province, has a serious tendency of disregarding politics. Leading cadres believe that raising the students' cultural level completes the political tasks given by the Party, thus only focusing on professional work and not on politics. Students believe that having culture is politics, so their enthusiasm is high when learning culture, but low when learning politics. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has unfolded vigorously throughout the country, but it is quiet and uneventful in our school; students only received some patriotic education from the masses during the cotton planting movement. Students did not seriously discuss the reports of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army; they were sparse and indifferent when participating in the May Day parade. When the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was reached, the masses celebrated with gongs and drums, but our cadres and students were indifferent to it. In the drought resistance, sowing, and patriotic cotton planting movement, all non-Party members went to the countryside to work, but only one of the eleven Party members in the organization branch participated. The regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries have been promulgated for a long time, but some students still do not know about them. The central government's decision to establish a propaganda network has neither been seriously studied nor implemented in our school. Cadres read the newspaper but do not propagate it, and anti-American and aid-Korea education in the school is neither popularized nor deepened. Due to the lack of a political atmosphere, various unhealthy trends have emerged in the school: students say strange things; Party members and non-Party members are not united; criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out; on the surface, everyone is harmonious, but behind the scenes, there are complaints and mutual accusations; cadres' enthusiasm for work is insufficient; and comrades lack class love.
    The emergence of these phenomena is mainly due to the Party General Branch Committee's relaxation of political leadership. The school leaders do not understand that cultural learning is precisely for realizing political tasks, and they have set the improvement of culture against the improvement of politics, believing that asking about politics will affect cultural learning. Therefore, they close the door to run the school and simply carry out cultural teaching. This is a serious mistake.
    Recently, the Party General Branch Committee felt the seriousness of this problem and conducted an inspection. In order to overcome this tendency of disregarding politics, we focused on criticizing the purely cultural viewpoint, making every comrade aware of the importance of political learning. The Party General Branch Committee will strengthen regular political education in the future, giving a political report to everyone every two weeks. Cadres and students should regularly pay attention to current affairs and give a current affairs propaganda to the masses once a week. In addition, the Party General Branch Committee will strengthen its leadership in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    Recently, we also saw the "Notice on Opposing the Tendency of Disregarding Politics" from the Xinxiang Local Committee, and we have more clearly recognized the danger of the erroneous tendency of disregarding politics ideologically. We have organized the entire school to study this document.

### 中共安阳地委工农文化补习学校  纠正忽视政治教学的偏向

　　中共安阳地委工农文化补习学校
    纠正忽视政治教学的偏向
    我们中共平原省安阳地方委员会所属工农文化补习学校有着严重的不问政治的倾向。领导干部认为提高了学生的文化水平，就完成了党所给予的政治任务，因而只问业务不问政治。学生则认为，有了文化就是政治，因而学习文化时情绪很高，学习政治时情绪就低。抗美援朝运动在全国轰轰烈烈地展开了，可是在我们学校里却是平平淡淡；学生们直到参加植棉运动时，才从群众那里受到一些爱国主义教育。学生们听了志愿军归国代表的报告，也没有严肃认真地进行讨论；参加“五一”游行示威时，稀稀拉拉满不在乎。和平解放西藏问题取得协议时，群众锣鼓喧天地举行庆祝，我们的干部和学生却对此漠不关心。在抗旱点种爱国植棉运动中，非党员全部下乡工作，机关支部十一个党员只有一个参加。惩治反革命条例公布很久，有些学生还不知道。中央建立宣传网的决定，在我校既没有认真学习，更没有贯彻执行。干部看了报纸不去宣传，抗美援朝的教育在校内，既不普及，更谈不到深入。由于政治空气的缺乏，学校中产生了各种邪气：学生说怪话；党员与非党员不团结；批评与自我批评不能开展，表面上大家一团和气，背地里上下埋怨，互相指责；干部工作积极性不够；同志间缺乏阶级友爱。
    这些现象的产生，主要由于学校党总支委员会放松了政治领导。学校领导同志不了解文化学习正是为了实现政治任务，而把提高文化与提高政治二者对立起来，认为过问政治会影响文化学习。因此就关门办学校，单纯进行文化教学。这是严重的错误。
    最近党总支委员会感到这个问题的严重性，就进行了检查。为了克服这种不问政治的倾向，我们着重地批判了单纯文化观点，使每个同志认识政治学习的重要性。党总支委员会今后将加强经常的政治教育，每两星期向大家作政治报告一次。干部、学生应经常注意时事学习，每周并应向群众作时事宣传一次。此外，党总支委员会并将加强对开展批评与自我批评的领导。
    最近，我们又看到了新乡地方委员会“反对不问政治的倾向”的通报，思想上更加明确地认清了不问政治错误倾向的危险性，我们已组织全校对这一文件进行学习。
