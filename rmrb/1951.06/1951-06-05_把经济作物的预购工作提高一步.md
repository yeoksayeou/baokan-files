　　Take Pre-Purchase Work of Cash Crops a Step Further
　　Wang Yueyi

　　After the pre-purchase agreements for cotton, hemp, and tobacco signed by the Central Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives were deployed, Hebei, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Beijing, and other places signed specific agreements based on the principles of the general agreement. Other cash crop areas are also carrying out pre-purchases in accordance with the spirit of the general agreement. Pre-purchase business is being vigorously carried out in the cash crop areas of North China, East China, Northwest China, and Central South China.

　　The development of pre-purchases has dispelled farmers' concerns about not being able to sell if they plant too much, about low prices, and about not having enough food to eat in the autumn, and has strengthened farmers' confidence in planting cash crops. After the pre-purchase work was carried out in Nanyuan, a suburb of Beijing, the cotton planting area increased by 26,000 mu compared with last year. Youwei Village in Ding County, Hebei Province, originally planned to plant 3,043 mu of cotton, but after pre-purchase, it expanded to 3,445 mu. There are many similar facts in other regions. Through pre-purchase and advance payment, cooperatives supplied farmers with a large number of means of production and living materials, solving the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing for farmers. According to preliminary statistics, cooperatives, combined with agricultural fertilizer loans and advance deposits from state-owned companies and financial grain, have prepaid farmers about 530 million jin of fertilizer, about 490 million jin of various grains, and a large number of other materials such as coal, which has played a great role in increasing production. The pre-purchase work has also changed the unreasonable lending relationship of "borrowing one stone in spring and returning one and a half stones after wheat harvest" in some new rural areas, improved the prestige of cooperatives, and developed members. From the beginning of pre-purchase to the end of April, Yuncheng Prefecture in Shanxi Province developed more than 50,000 members. In the first ten days of May, Ding County, Hebei Province, pre-purchased more than 8.4 million jin of cotton from 40,955 households in 272 villages. According to incomplete statistics, North China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China have signed agreements to pre-purchase 5.9333 million dan of cotton.

Problems Existing in the Pre-Purchase Work

　　1. The development of pre-purchase work is very uneven. Some regions have made great achievements, while others have made very little. In areas where cooperative leadership is tight, closely integrated with other economic departments under the leadership of the Party and government, and propaganda is in-depth, farmers welcome pre-purchase, and pre-purchase is relatively smooth. Ding County, Hebei Province, only pre-purchased 830,000 jin of cotton by the end of April; after review, it reorganized its forces, the director personally took action, and went deep into the grassroots cooperatives to mobilize the masses to compete. By mid-May, it had completed the pre-purchase of 9.4233 million jin of cotton, more than ten times the achievement of the previous month. However, some cooperatives have been indifferent to pre-purchase work and have not yet achieved results. Dezhou Prefecture in Shandong Province had not yet started pre-purchase by early May, and only emphasized advance payment. The advance payment of materials was not combined with the pre-purchase work, but adopted a general average lending method. Therefore, the pre-purchase work has been stagnated at the prefectural level and needs to be corrected urgently.

　　2. Some regions have not seriously implemented the spirit of the general agreement between the Central Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives; some regions have even violated the agreement in handling price issues. For example, the agreement stipulates that if the market price is higher than the listed price and the cooperative consults the company but cannot purchase at the market price, farmers can sell to the market, but the advance payment of materials must be recovered at the listed price. Some regions, regardless of whether the payment has been made or not, announced that farmers can freely sell to the market. Some regions do not combine the advance payment of grain with pre-purchase, forming a simple loan. Some regions emphasize that the advance payment of grain should be loaned to military families or members. The one-sided relief viewpoint separates advance payment from pre-purchase, separates it from expanding the planting of cash crops, and makes a large number of advance payment of materials unable to give full play to its role. The agreement stipulates that the masses can be prepaid with some materials when the state has surplus capacity and the farmers are indeed in difficulty. Some regional cooperatives overemphasize advance payment, affecting pre-purchase. Some regions violate the agreement that the advance payment shall not exceed 20% of the total value and implement full advance payment, which will inevitably cause many difficulties for cooperatives and state-owned companies and farmers in settlement when recovering pre-purchases, and even lead to losses in price differences in settlement.

　　3. Many cooperatives believe that the order form and report form system is too troublesome, so they do it carelessly. They do not understand that investigating the needs of farmers after autumn is to supply farmers with materials in a planned way to avoid currency congestion and unstable prices; or to form a blind supply, which cannot meet the needs of farmers, accumulate funds, cannot recover pre-purchased crops, and lose credibility with the people.

　　In addition, there are individual areas that mistakenly carry out pre-purchase in a forced apportionment manner. Some cooperatives emphasize that operating expenses are difficult and require advance payment of handling fees, but they are not actively carrying out the work. Some regional cooperatives have not actively reported the problems in pre-purchase to the local financial committee, nor have they closely combined with other departments to solve the difficulties in pre-purchase. In addition, the pre-purchase of hemp and tobacco has not attracted the attention of cooperatives at all levels, and the results are not great.

How to Take the Pre-Purchase Business a Step Further

　　Pre-purchase business is the central work for cooperatives to implement throughout the year, not only before the sowing of cash crops, but also after sowing. In order to take the pre-purchase business a step further, cooperatives at all levels should appoint special personnel to take charge of this work, adhere to the reporting system, and dispatch cadres to conduct roving inspections. Those who have not done well in the previous stage, or have made deviations, should be redeployed and restarted. Those who conflict with the principles of the general agreement should be re-explained to the cadres, explained to the farmers as soon as possible, and corrected.

　　When carrying out pre-purchase work, special attention should be paid to conducting extensive and in-depth publicity to farmers in cash crop areas, so that the masses of farmers understand that pre-purchase is the best way to protect the production interests of farmers, ensure the price of agricultural products, and ensure the timely supply of industrial products. Make farmers fully understand that this is the people's government's concern for farmers, so that farmers can improve their patriotism and production enthusiasm in pre-purchase work, and understand the close relationship between planting cash crops and developing industrial production. Under the unified leadership of the Party at all levels, the cooperative should closely cooperate with other groups and financial and trade departments to solve the problems of advance payment and guarantee supply in a timely manner.

　　At the same time, the organization of pre-purchase business should be strengthened, and the system and procedures should be strictly followed. Some cooperatives emphasize that the ability of grassroots cooperative cadres is weak, ignore the system of procedures, and do not study management, which will cause irreparable trouble and losses, and affect the cooperative's promise to farmers to guarantee supply.

　　For advance payment of materials, according to the local national material strength and the actual situation of farmers' difficulties, the advance payment of materials should not exceed 20% of the pre-purchase amount. In non-disaster areas and areas where the country has no surplus capacity, advance payment should not be overemphasized, but credit pre-purchase should be emphasized, and farmers should be ordered to "insure tickets" to ensure that farmers will not sell out or sell at low prices. At the same time, the advance payment of materials should not be distributed equally. Those with more production difficulties can be prepaid more; those with less difficulties can be paid less or not paid for materials.

　　There are still several months from spring plowing and sowing to autumn harvest. All localities should continue to work hard to carry out pre-purchase. The larger the amount of pre-purchase, the more stable the price of cash crops will be, and the more it can guarantee the needs of industrial production and military and civilian life.

### 把经济作物的预购工作提高一步

　　把经济作物的预购工作提高一步
    王越毅
    中央贸易部、纺织工业部和全国合作总社签定的棉、麻、烟预购协议布置下去之后，河北、山东、苏北、北京等地根据总协议的原则签定了具体协议。其他经济作物区也根据总协议精神进行着预购。预购业务正在华北、华东、西北、中南经济作物区大力开展中。
    预购的开展，解除了农民怕种多了卖不出，怕价低，怕秋后没粮食吃等思想顾虑，增强了农民种植经济作物的信心。北京郊区南苑开展预购工作后，植棉面积较去年增加二万六千亩。河北省定县油味村原计划植棉三○四三亩，经过预购，扩大到三四四五亩。其他地区相同的事实很多。合作社通过预购预付，供应了农民大批生产资料和生活资料，解决了农民春耕播种的困难。根据初步统计，合作社结合农业贷肥和国营公司预付定金及财政粮，已预付农民肥料约五亿三千余万斤，各种粮食约四亿九千余万斤，及煤炭等实物甚多，在提高生产中起了很大作用。预购工作并改变了某些新区农村“春借一石、麦后还一石五”的不合理借贷关系，提高了合作社威信，发展了社员。山西运城专区从开始预购到四月底，发展社员五万余人。河北省定县五月上旬一旬，即向二百七十二个村四万零九百五十五户预购了棉花八百四十余万斤。据不完全统计，华北、华东、中南、西南、西北各区，已签订协议预购棉花五百九十三万三千担。
            预购工作中存在的问题
    一、预购工作发展很不平衡。有些地区成绩较大，有些地区成绩还很小。凡是合作社领导上抓得紧，在党政领导下密切和其他经济部门结合，宣传深入的地区，农民即对预购表示欢迎，预购就较顺利。河北定县到四月底止仅预购棉花八十三万斤；经过检讨，重新组织力量，主任亲自下手，深入基层社发动群众竞赛，到五月中旬，已完成九百四十二万三千斤的棉花预购，超过以往一个多月成绩的十倍。但有些合作社对预购工作一直漠不关心，至今还没收到成绩。山东德州专区到五月上旬尚未开展预购，而仅强调预付。预付的实物亦未和预购工作结合，而采取了一般的平均贷放方式。所以预购工作一直停止在专区级，急须改正。
    二、对中央贸易部和全国合作总社总协议原则的精神，有些地区尚未认真执行；有的地区甚至违背协议处理价格上的原则问题。如协议规定：市价高于牌价，合作社征求公司意见而又不能按市价收购者，农民可向市场出售，但其预付实物部分得按牌价收回。有的地区不分已付未付，即宣布农民可自由向市场出售。有的地区把预付粮不和预购结合，形成单纯贷放。有的地区则强调预付粮贷给军属或社员。片面的救济观点，使预付和预购脱节，和扩大经济作物播种脱节，使大批预付实物不能充分发挥作用。协议规定：国家有余力、农民确有困难的情况下可预付群众一部实物。有的地区合作社过分强调预付，影响了预购。有的地区违背协议所规定的预付不得超过总值的百分之二十，而实行全部预付，这势必造成在收回预购时合作社和国家公司和农民结算上的许多困难，甚至要遭致结算中价格差别的损失。
    三、不少合作社认为订货单、报告单制度太麻烦，就草草了事。不了解调查农民秋后的需要，是为了有计划地供应农民实物，避免形成货币拥挤，物价不稳；或形成盲目供应，不能适应农民需要，积压资金，收不回预购作物，失信于民。
    此外，还有个别地区错误地以强迫摊派方式进行预购。有的合作社强调开支困难，要求先付手续费，不积极进行。有的地区合作社未主动向当地财委汇报预购中的问题，也未和其他部门密切结合，解决预购中的困难。另外，麻、烟预购尚未引起各级社注意，成绩不大。
              如何把预购业务提高一步
    预购业务是合作社贯彻全年的中心工作，不仅在经济作物播种之前要做，播种之后仍然要做。为把预购业务提高一步，各级合作社应指定专人掌握这一工作，坚持报告制度，并抽调干部进行巡回检查。凡前一阶段未搞好的，或出了偏差的，应重新布置，重新进行。和总协议的原则有相抵触的，应重新向干部解释，及早向农民说明，加以改正。
    在进行预购工作时，应特别注意向经济作物区的农民进行广泛深入的宣传，使农民群众了解预购是保障农民生产利益、保证农产品价格和保证及时供应工业品的最好的办法。使农民充分了解这是人民政府对农民的关心，使农民在预购工作中提高爱国主义思想和生产积极性，并了解种植经济作物和发展工业生产的密切关系。合作社应在各级党的统一领导下，结合其他团体，和财政贸易部门密切配合，及时解决预付及保证供应问题。
    同时，应加强预购业务的组织工作，严密制度、手续。有些合作社强调基层社干部能力弱，忽视手续制度，不研究管理，将会造成难以弥补的麻烦和损失，影响合作社履行对农民保证供应的诺言。
    对预付实物，应根据当地国家物资力量，和农民困难的实际情况，预付不超过预购额百分之二十的实物。在非灾区和国家无余力的地区，不应过分强调预付，而应强调信用预购，向农民订“保险票”，保证农民不会卖不出或卖价低。同时，预付实物亦不应平均分配。生产困难多的可多预付；困难小的，可少付或不付实物。
    春耕播种后到秋收还有几个月的时间，各地应继续努力进行预购。预购的数量愈大，经济作物的价格就愈稳定，也愈能保证工业生产和军民生活的需要。
