Labor Model Wang Shilin Writes to National Agricultural Labor Models
Hoping Farmer Brothers Sell Stored Cotton to Help the Government Overcome Difficulties

Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory labor model Wang Shilin wrote a letter to the national agricultural labor models, requesting cotton farmer brothers to respond to the call of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sell their stored cotton, and unite with the workers to help the government overcome difficulties. The original text of the letter is as follows:

Comrades, National Agricultural Labor Models:

For more than two years, China's cotton production has been increasing rapidly. These are all achievements you have gained through hard work. Along with your efforts, we are also working hard to increase the output of the textile industry. In the past two years, the unit output of 20-count yarn in our factory has increased from about 0.6 pounds to more than 1.1 pounds. Chairman Mao instructed us to increase production by one inch, and our workers and farmers across the country have worked hard according to his words.

Chairman Mao led us to turn over, and our lives have improved. The supply of yarn and cloth has increased day by day, so our need for cotton has also increased. Because our country's cotton production is not enough, and because some farmer brothers are still storing a batch of cotton and have not sold it to the state in time, this has caused us to stop work due to temporary insufficient cotton supply. This is a great loss to the country. We have calculated this account for the country. We estimate that if textile factories across the country stop work for a month, then the country will lose more than one million tons of grain, which is equivalent to half of Romania's annual grain production. We are a private factory, and we have stopped work in the past, but who has ever cared about whether we have food to eat like today? Many workers in our factory were extremely moved when they heard that the government would give us wages, and we even proposed not to take them. At present, our most urgent hope is to have enough cotton immediately so that we can continue to work and dedicate all our strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. At present, the people across the country are working hard for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but only at this time, we have no work to do. Some workers said, "Having no work to do is like a fire burning our hearts!" We are indeed so anxious, because we know that after liberation, we are already the masters of the country.

Now we are studying. The government tells us to seize this opportunity, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds well, improve our level of political consciousness, and prepare to take on more arduous tasks on the production front. We must also repair our own machines and prepare to make them play a greater role. We will definitely guarantee the implementation of the government's instructions to us. We unanimously guarantee that we will produce more and reduce waste when we resume work. Now we are preparing a anti-waste exhibition, everyone says: In the future, we will never waste cotton.

A few days ago, we saw the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on cotton purchase and storage work and the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we were extremely happy. I believe you will do this work very well. I hope you will take the lead in calling on cotton farmers across the country to sell or lend their stored cotton to the state. And I hope you can drive cotton farmers across the country to grow more cotton. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will surely overcome all difficulties. Imperialism hopes that we will stop work and reduce production, but we have enough confidence to overcome difficulties and increase production. Of course, this also depends on our concerted efforts.

    Salute,
                      Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory labor model Wang Shilin

　　劳动模范王世麟给全国农业劳动模范写信
    希望农民兄弟出售存棉帮助政府战胜困难
    天津私营恒源纺织厂劳动模范王世麟，给全国农业劳动模范写信，要求棉农兄弟响应中央人民政府政务院和中共中央的号召，出卖自己的存棉，和工人团结一起，帮助政府战胜困难。该信原文如下：全国农业劳动模范同志们：
    两年多来，我国的棉花产量是飞快地增加。这都是你们辛辛苦苦得来的成绩。和你们的努力同时，我们也努力提高纺织工业的产量。两年来，我厂的二十支纱的单位产量，已从零点六磅左右提高到一点一磅以上。毛主席嘱咐我们要把生产长一寸，我们全国的工人农民按着他的话努力地作了。
    毛主席领导我们翻了身，我们的生活提高了。纱和布的供应量逐日增加了，因此，我们对于棉花的需要也跟着增多了。由于我们国家的棉花产量还不够多，又由于有些农民兄弟还储存着一批棉花，没有及时卖给国家，这就使得我们因为棉花暂时供给不足而停了工。这对国家是一个极大的损失。我们曾经替国家算过这笔账，我们估计，全国的纺织厂假如停一个月的工，那么国家就等于损失一百万吨以上的粮食，这相当于罗马尼亚全年粮食产量的一半。我们是私营工厂，我们过去也停过工，但是谁曾象今天这样顾及我们是否有饭吃呢？我们厂里许多工人听到政府要给我们工资，我们感动极了，我们曾提议不要。目前我们最迫切的希望就是马上有足够的棉花让我们继续开工，为抗美援朝保家卫国而献出我们一切的力量。目前全国人民正为抗美援朝而紧张地工作着，惟独在这个时候，我们却没有活干。有些工友说：“没有工作做，就好象火烧咱们的心！”我们确是这么着急，因为我们知道，解放以后，我们已是国家的主人了。
    现在我们正在学习。政府告诉我们要抓住这个时机，好好用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来武装起我们的头脑，提高政治觉悟水平，准备在生产战线上担负起更艰巨的任务。还要整修好我们自己的机器，准备让它发挥更大的效力。我们一定保证实现政府对我们的指示。我们一致保证，再开工时一定多生产，减少浪费。现在我们正准备着一个反浪费展览会，大家说：以后，我们决不浪费棉花。
    前几天，我们看到中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示和中共中央的号召，我们高兴极了。我相信你们对这个工作，一定会做得很好。我希望你们带头号召全国棉农，把存棉卖给或借给国家。并且希望你们能带动全国棉农，种出更多的棉花。我们在毛主席英明领导下，一定能战胜一切困难。帝国主义希望我们停工减产，但是我们有足够的信心可以战胜困难，而且还要增加生产。当然，这还要倚靠我们的一致努力。
    致以敬礼
