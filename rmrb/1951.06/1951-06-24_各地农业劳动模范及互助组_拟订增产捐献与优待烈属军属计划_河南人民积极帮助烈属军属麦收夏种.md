Agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams in various regions are drafting plans for increased production, donations, and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and are challenging mutual aid teams in their respective regions. Agricultural labor model Luo Guangming from the Wan Nan area and the 32 production mutual aid teams he leads in Fengling Village, Guichi County, held a general meeting of all members, unanimously passing a resolution to launch a patriotic competition with all agricultural production mutual aid teams in Wan Nan. Their conditions are: 1. All 122 households of the mutual aid team members, along with 22 farmers who have not joined production mutual aid teams, will donate 10.55 million yuan from increased production to purchase airplanes and cannons, with donations to be paid in batches before the end of September. 2. Guarantee that the living standards of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary military personnel, and disabled soldiers are not lower than those of each mutual aid team member. Their opinions should be sought regularly, and assistance should be provided immediately when difficulties are discovered. Each mutual aid team should prioritize cultivation for them, ensuring four weeding sessions in the paddy fields and seven hoeing sessions in the cotton fields. 3. Guarantee the full realization of the patriotic production increase plan in response to the challenge from the Li Shunda mutual aid team, applying more topdressing fertilizer, weeding more, so that the grain stalks grow well; democratically manage ponds and dams, dredge waterways, and repair waterwheels to prevent drought and flood. Lu Zhaogeng, an agricultural labor model from Su Nan who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, also formulated a plan for increased production and donations, preparing to increase production of agricultural crops worth 1.358 million yuan this year for the purpose of donating to purchase airplanes and cannons. Yang Tiancai, a well-known agricultural labor model in Hunan Province, held a family meeting and decided that his family would increase cotton production by 15 jin on their 15 mu of cotton fields, donate it to purchase airplanes and cannons, and improve sideline production, raising at least one pig and three chickens to comfort the People's Volunteers.

The 14 mutual aid teams in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, have also recently formulated plans for increased production, donations, and preferential treatment for families of military personnel. They decided: during the wheat harvest, each mutual aid team will send two people to go to the market, donating all of the more than 400,000 yuan earned; after the wheat harvest, 27 people will be sent to the South Mountain to cut bamboo, collect firewood, gather herbs, and sell lacquer, donating 5% to 10% of the income from this sideline production; guarantee that the lives of the 13 families of revolutionary military personnel in the village will not be difficult.

Xinhua News Agency: People in various parts of Henan Province are actively helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with wheat harvesting and summer planting. Before the start of the wheat harvest and summer planting, people in various places discussed the issue of helping families of martyrs and military personnel with wheat harvesting and summer planting, and incorporated it into patriotic covenants and summer production plans. As the wheat harvest and summer planting began, people in various places launched a competition of "cutting quickly, harvesting cleanly, and planting in a timely manner." Twenty-four young men and women members of the Communist Youth League in Sunwan Township, Zhenping County, helped harvest 24 mu in three days. Seventy-two students of the Laozhuang Township Civil School in Nanyang County, after studying the announcement of the three major appeals of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, helped harvest 24 mu in one morning. Government agencies, stationed troops, and schools in the province also enthusiastically helped families of martyrs and military personnel with wheat harvesting and summer planting. 3,000 people from various directly subordinate units in the Chenliu Special District were dispatched to help with harvesting and planting. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Gushi County helped families of martyrs and military personnel harvest more than 120 dan of wheat and water more than 20 dan of fields in three days. Teachers and students from Kaifeng Girls' Middle School, Zhumadian Middle School, and other schools also went to the countryside to help with the harvest.
