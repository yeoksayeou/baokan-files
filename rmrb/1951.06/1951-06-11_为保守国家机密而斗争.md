　　Struggle to Protect State Secrets
    Strictly protecting state secrets is an important part of the struggle against the enemy and one of the issues concerning the greatest interests of the people of the whole country. In February 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on safeguarding state secrets for government personnel at all levels. Last winter and this spring, major administrative regions, provinces, and cities conducted inspections of confidentiality work. They discovered many serious phenomena of leaking and losing state secrets, which greatly surprised and alerted some regions' and leaders' organs and leading cadres. They began to review the bureaucracy in leadership and the paralyzing thoughts among cadres and have begun to attach importance to confidentiality work. However, many regions and leaders have not conducted comprehensive enough inspections of confidentiality work, especially not deeply enough. They have not attached due importance to confidentiality work, and until now, the phenomenon of losing and leaking state secrets has not stopped, and the thought of underestimating the enemy and paralysis has not been thoroughly corrected. Therefore, the National Secretary-General Conference held in April this year listed confidentiality work as a major agenda item and formulated the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets (Draft)." This draft has been approved and promulgated by the 87th Executive Meeting of the State Council and approved by the Chairman. This is one of the major events in our national construction work and should arouse the serious attention of the people of the whole country.
    The primary step in correctly implementing the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets" is to establish a patriotic and national-scale concept of protecting secrets among the people of the whole country, especially among all personnel of the people's governments at all levels, democratic parties, people's organizations, organs, schools, factories, enterprises, mines, warehouses, etc., in combination with patriotic ideological education. This is determined by the historical situation of our country and the current domestic and international political environment, and therefore it is a task that the people of the whole country must pay attention to.
    Historically, old China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. Its state secrets were always exposed to imperialism, and even many state secrets, such as national defense plans, information on important resources, and many statistics, were basically directly controlled by one or several imperialist countries. The ruling class of old China could never truly protect state secrets, and even sold out state secrets for their own benefit. Therefore, there was no question of protecting state secrets in old China, and there could be no nationwide people's confidentiality education. This was the inevitable result of the collusion between the reactionary government of old China and imperialism. Now, the people have become the masters of the country, and the defeated domestic and foreign enemies are using various means at all times to steal our state secrets and undermine our country's various construction undertakings. Under these circumstances, protecting state secrets and stealing state secrets have become a sharp struggle between the Chinese people and the enemies of the Chinese people. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have always paid attention to confidentiality work in the process of creating their own political party, army, and regime. This excellent tradition of confidentiality has become an important condition for preserving ourselves and eliminating the enemy in various complex struggles in history. However, after the national victory, our past experience in confidentiality has been insufficient to meet today's needs. Therefore, the confidentiality work that has been established in some aspects based on these experiences is also fragmented and partial, and has not been unified and scaled nationally with the development of the revolutionary situation. From the perspective of the entire country, there is a serious state of anarchy in our confidentiality work today. What is particularly serious is that many state workers have developed a fairly serious sense of paralysis due to the national victory. They think: "Everything is open, what secrets are still needed! It's not like doing underground work now." They do not understand that it is precisely because we have changed from secret to public and the enemy has changed from public to hidden that we need to be more vigilant and strictly guard secrets. They do not understand that in a situation where the country belongs to the people, any phenomenon of loss or leakage of secrets will directly or indirectly harm the interests of 475 million people. The existing phenomena of loss and leakage of secrets have fully proved that any sense of paralysis in the struggle against the enemy will lead to huge losses to the people and the motherland! Therefore, eliminating this ideological obstacle and developing fragmented and partial confidentiality work into unified and national-scale confidentiality work is an extremely urgent political task at present.
    The so-called establishing unified national-scale confidentiality work is to establish comprehensive, systematic, universally responsible, strict, and regular confidentiality work.
    That is to say, every aspect and every department of national work must establish confidentiality work without exception. The view that only this part has secrets and that part does not, or that only confidential departments have secrets and other departments do not, is incorrect. Every aspect of national work has secrets. The most important issue in establishing this comprehensive confidentiality work is to clearly define the scope and boundaries of confidentiality. Article 2 of the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets" has stipulated the basic scope of state secrets. As for the specific scope of each aspect, it must be clearly divided by the respective business departments through careful research. This is a complex, difficult, and urgent task that must be done well through various methods, first and foremost by the leaders taking responsibility and personally doing it; otherwise, people will not know what is a secret and what is not, and the leadership will have no way to conduct confidentiality education for cadres and staff, improve everyone's specific understanding of safeguarding state secrets, and enable them to earnestly safeguard state secrets.
    At the same time, a strict and practical confidentiality system must be established from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and confidentiality organizations must be established where necessary. In view of the fact that although some places currently have regulations on the confidentiality system, the system has become a mere formality because there is no confidentiality organization to implement it, the State Council meeting also passed the "Provisional Organizational Rules for Confidentiality Committees of People's Governments at All Levels," and clearly defined the tasks and powers of the confidentiality committees. People's governments at all levels should earnestly implement this under the principle of leaders taking responsibility and personally doing it, in order to fully exert the effectiveness of this organization.
    Comprehensive and systematic confidentiality work must rely on everyone being responsible to be done well. Originally, safeguarding state secrets is the obligation of all the people, not just the matter of a few people; but many people still do not understand this. Some people think that confidentiality is only a matter for Communist Party members, and mistakenly believe that "only Communist Party members have access to state secrets." This is incorrect and does not conform to the actual situation. Because our country belongs to all the people, no matter which democratic party or which democratic class, of course they have the same responsibility for confidentiality work that concerns the safety of the country and therefore the well-being of the people of the whole country. At present, people from various democratic parties and various democratic classes are holding important positions in people's governments at all levels from the central to the local level. They participate in or have access to state secrets to a greater or lesser extent according to certain responsibilities, and there is no distinction due to different parties. Of course, Communist Party members should and must play a model role in confidentiality work to promote all the people to do this work well, but it cannot be thought that only Communist Party members have the responsibility to protect secrets. Secondly, some people think that only confidential personnel have the responsibility to protect secrets, and they only regard confidential personnel as a few people who manage telegrams. This narrow view of confidentiality work is incorrect. In fact, in addition to confidential personnel who manage telegrams, there are many staff members who handle confidential matters; even general staff members have many opportunities to come into contact with state confidential matters. Therefore, all staff members must earnestly safeguard state secrets. Again, some people think that confidentiality is only a matter for state workers and has nothing to do with the general public, which negates the mass nature of confidentiality work. This narrow view of confidentiality work is also incorrect. In fact, in the long years of revolutionary war in the past, many people in the revolutionary base areas were able to keep all the secrets of the struggle against the enemy very well. In order to strictly guard secrets, they were unyielding in the face of the enemy and even sacrificed their lives, showing the noble spirit of the Chinese people. Therefore, it is necessary to educate all state workers and the people of the whole country to recognize that safeguarding state secrets is their sacred duty, and gradually cultivate good patriotic confidentiality habits in every one of the people of the whole country. Only when everyone is responsible can state secrets be truly and thoroughly protected.
    Because confidentiality work is a matter of struggle against the enemy, it should not only be a regular and meticulous work, but also must be very strict in terms of system and discipline. For this reason, Articles 7 to 12 of the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets" prevent the possibility of loss and leakage of secrets from all aspects and plug some of the larger loopholes in the current loss and leakage of secrets; from Articles 13 to 16, the methods of reward and punishment are clearly stipulated according to different circumstances. According to the current actual situation, there are four types of loss of secrets: The first is the reconnaissance, theft or resale by domestic and foreign spies, counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs; the second is that although the person who leaks secrets is not a counter-revolutionary, what he does is counter-revolutionary in nature, such as using state secrets to speculate for profit; the third is that staff members have negligence, liberalism, "small broadcast" and careless bad habits, and lose or miss state secrets; the fourth is the "ignorance" of some people, lack of confidentiality knowledge, do not know what is confidential, and therefore leak secrets. These four situations should be dealt with separately. In particular, major cases of loss or leakage of secrets that have occurred in the past should be investigated and cleared up as necessary. It is also incorrect to only emphasize education and not implement a clear system of rewards and punishments.
    But this is by no means abandoning education. On the contrary, because safeguarding state secrets is the task of all state workers and the responsibility of the broad masses of the people, and the existence of loss and leakage of secrets is not only because of the intentional theft of counter-revolutionaries, but also because some state workers and the people are negligent and ignorant of confidentiality work, so that counter-revolutionaries can take advantage of it. Therefore, all localities should launch a large-scale confidentiality education movement at an appropriate time based on the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets." When conducting confidentiality education, it is necessary to link it with the current political situation and struggle tasks; at present, it should be closely integrated with the three major movements of resisting the United States and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. First of all, all staff members of state organs must receive this education without exception, so that they understand the importance of safeguarding state secrets, improve their political consciousness, consciously abide by the confidentiality system, develop confidentiality habits, and become models for safeguarding state secrets. To this end, all departments should conduct thorough and universal confidentiality inspections in this movement from the ideological, institutional, and work aspects, in order to sum up experiences and lessons and educate staff members. For the broad masses, propaganda and education on safeguarding state secrets should also be carried out appropriately, so that all the people understand that safeguarding state secrets is the duty of every citizen, and confidentiality clauses can be stipulated in patriotic covenants according to different circumstances and environments, so that confidentiality work becomes a widespread mass work. After such a movement, this work can be turned into a regular one, and continuous and serious and meticulous inspections can be carried out to ensure that state secrets can be protected without loss.
    The establishment of a system for safeguarding state secrets is a historic task and a huge project in the ideological construction of the people of the whole country. The formulation of the "Provisional Regulations on Safeguarding State Secrets" has already pointed out the direction for this work, but this is only the beginning of the matter, and a series of work must be carried out afterwards. It is hoped that the people of the whole country, especially all state workers, will mobilize together to fight for the establishment of unified, national-scale confidentiality work and to ensure state secrets!

### 为保守国家机密而斗争

　　为保守国家机密而斗争
    严格地保守国家机密，是对敌斗争的重要环节，是关系全国人民最大利益的问题之一。一九五○年二月，中央人民政府政务院发布了关于各级政府工作人员保守国家机密的指示，去冬今春各大行政区、各省市进行了保密工作的检查，发现许多严重泄露、遗失国家机密的现象，使某些地区某些领导机关与领导干部大吃一惊，引起严重警惕，开始检讨了领导上的官僚主义和干部中的麻痹思想，对保密工作业已重视，但还有许多地区许多领导人员对于保密工作的检查不够普遍，特别是不够深入，对保密工作也没有应有的重视，直到现在，遗失与泄露国家机密的现象还没有停止，轻敌的麻痹思想还没有彻底纠正。因此，今年四月间举行的全国秘书长会议，把保密工作列为主要议程，并制定了《保守国家机密暂行条例草案》。这一草案已由政务院第八十七次政务会议通过，并经主席批准公布施行。这是我们国家建设工作中的重大事件之一，应该引起全国人民的严重注意。
    正确执行《保守国家机密暂行条例》的首要一环，是在全国人民中，首先在各级人民政府、各民主党派、各人民团体、各机关、学校、工厂、企业、矿山、仓库等全体人员中，结合爱国主义的思想教育，建立爱国的而又是国家规模的保守机密观念。这是我国历史情况与当前国内外政治环境所决定的，因而是全国人民必须重视的任务。
    历史上的旧中国，是殖民地半殖民地半封建的国家。它的国家机密从来是暴露在帝国主义面前的，甚至有许多国家机密，例如国防计划、重要资源情况和很多统计数字，基本上直接掌握在某一个或某几个帝国主义手里，而旧中国的统治阶级从来不可能真正地保护国家机密，甚至为了自己的利益出卖国家机密。因此旧的中国是谈不到保守国家机密的，因此也不可能有全国规模的人民的保密教育。这是旧中国的反动政府与帝国主义勾结的必然结果。现在，人民已经成为国家的主人，而失败了的国内外敌人则时时刻刻使用各种手段，以窃取我们的国家机密，以破坏我们国家的各种建设事业。在这种情形下，保护国家机密和窃取国家机密，就成为中国人民和中国人民的敌人之间的一个尖锐的斗争。中国工人阶级和中国人民在创立自己的政党、军队和政权的过程中，从来就是注意保密工作的。这种优良的保密传统，在历史上各种复杂的斗争中，成为保存自己消灭敌人的一个重要条件。但在全国胜利以后，我们过去的保密经验，已不足适应今天的需要，因而，依靠这些经验在若干方面已经建立起来的保密工作，也是零碎的、局部的，还没有随着革命形势的发展，建立起统一的、国家规模的保密工作。从整个国家的范围来说，我们今天的保密工作存在着严重的无政府状态。尤其严重的是，许多国家工作人员，由于全国胜利而发生了相当严重的麻痹思想。他们以为：“一切都公开了，还要什么秘密！现在又不是做地下工作。”他们不懂得，正因为我们已由秘密转为公开，敌人已从公开转入隐蔽，才更须要我们提高警惕，严守机密。他们不了解在国家已属于人民的情形下，任何失密或泄密的现象，都将直接或间接危害着四亿七千五百万人民的利益。现在已有的失密泄密现象已经充分地证明了在对敌斗争中存在着任何麻痹思想，将会招致对人民对祖国巨大的损失！因此，扫除这种思想障碍，并把零碎的、局部的保密工作，发展成为统一的、国家规模的保密工作，乃是当前极其迫切的政治任务。
    所谓建立统一的国家规模的保密工作，就是建立全面的、系统的、人人负责的、严格的、经常的保密工作。
    这就是说，国家工作的任何方面，任何部门，必须无例外地把保密工作建立起来。那种认为只是这一部分有机密，那一部分没有机密，或只是机要部门有机密，其他部门没有机密的观点是不对的。国家工作的每一个方面都有机密。要建立这种全面的保密工作，最重要的问题是划清保密的范围和界限。《保守国家机密暂行条例》的第二条，已对国家机密的基本范围作了规定，至于各个方面的具体范围，则必须由各个业务部门经过细密的研究，划分清楚。这是一项复杂、繁难而迫切的工作，必须经过各种方法，首先必须是首长负责、亲自动手把它做好；不然，人们就不知道什么是机密，什么不是机密，领导上也即无从向干部和工作人员进行保密教育，提高大家保守国家机密的具体认识，使能认真保守国家机密。
    同时，必须自上而下、自下而上地建立一套严密的切合实际的保密制度，并在必要的地方建立保密组织。鉴于目前若干地方虽有保密制度的规定，但因为没有保密组织去贯彻执行，致使制度成为具文，因此这次政务院会议又通过了《各级人民政府保密委员会暂行组织通则》，并对于保密委员会的任务和职权等等事项，作了明确规定，各级人民政府应在首长负责、亲自动手的原则下，切实执行，以便充分发挥这种组织的效能。
    全面的系统的保密工作，必须依靠人人负责才能做好。本来，保守国家机密是全体人民的义务，不是一部分人的事情；但是有许多人还不了解这一点。有人认为保密只是共产党员的事情，错误地认为“只有共产党员才接触国家机密”。这是不对的，不符合实际情况的。因为我们的国家是属于全体人民的，不论那一民主党派、那一民主阶层，对于关系国家安危因而也是关系全国人民祸福的保密工作，当然同有责任。现在从中央到地方各级人民政府，都有各民主党派、各民主阶层的人员担负着重要工作。他们依照一定的职责或多或少地参预或接触国家机密，并不因党派不同而有区别。当然，共产党员应该而且必须在保密工作中起模范作用，以推动全体人民把这一工作做好，但不能认为只有共产党员才有保密的责任。其次，有人认为只有机要人员才有保密责任，并且把机要人员只看成是几个管理电报的人员。这种把保密工作狭隘化的看法是不对的。事实上，除了管理电报的机要人员以外，还有许多工作人员要承办机密事项；即令一般工作人员，也有不少机会接触国家机密事项。因此，一切工作人员均必须切实保守国家机密。再次，有人认为保密只是国家工作人员的事情，与一般人民无关，这就把保密工作的群众性否定了。这种把保密工作狭隘化的看法也是不对的。实际上，在过去长久的革命战争的年代里，革命根据地的许多群众，都能很好地保守对敌斗争的一切机密。他们为了严守机密，在敌人面前坚贞不屈，甚至牺牲了生命，表现了中国人民的高尚气节。因此，必须教育全体国家工作人员和全国人民认识保守国家机密乃是自己的神圣义务，逐渐使全国人民每一个人都养成良好的爱国的保密习惯。也只有人人负责，才能真正地彻底地保护国家机密。
    由于保密工作是一个对敌斗争的问题，它不仅应该是经常的细致的工作，而且在制度上纪律上也必须是十分严格的。为此，《保守国家机密暂行条例》在第七条到第十二条的规定中，从各方面防止失密与泄密的可能，杜塞目前失密泄密的若干较大的漏洞；从第十三条到第十六条，又根据不同情况，明确规定了奖惩办法。根据现在的实际情况，失密状态共有四种：第一种是国内外间谍分子、反革命分子和破坏分子的侦察、偷窃或盗卖；第二种是泄密的人虽非反革命分子，但他所做的事情则是反革命性质的，例如利用国家机密投机取利等；第三种是工作人员有疏忽、自由主义、“小广播”和粗枝大叶的不良作风，把国家机密遗失或遗漏了；第四种是一部分人的“无知”，缺乏保密知识，不懂得什么是机密，因而泄漏机密。对于这四种情况，应分别加以处理。特别是过去已经发生的重大失密或泄密案件，应该进行必要的追查和清理。只强调教育，不实行严明的奖惩制度也是不对的。
    但这决不是放弃教育，恰恰相反，因为保守国家机密是全体国家工作人员的任务，也是广大人民群众的责任，而且失密与泄密现象的存在，不仅因为反革命分子的有意窃取，也因为有些国家工作人员以及人民群众对于保密工作的疏忽与无知，以致给反革命分子以可乘之机。所以各地应该依据《保守国家机密暂行条例》，选择适当时机，展开一个大规模的保密教育运动。在进行保密教育时，要联系当前的政治形势与斗争任务；目前则应与抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动密切结合起来。首先要使全体国家机关工作人员无例外地受到这种教育，使他们懂得保守国家机密的重要性，提高政治觉悟，自觉地遵守保密制度，养成保密习惯，并成为保守国家机密的模范。为此，各部门应在这一运动中，从思想上、制度上、工作上进行彻底的、普遍的保密检查，借以总结经验教训，教育工作人员。对于广大群众，也应该适当地进行保守国家机密的宣传教育，使全体人民都了解保守国家机密是每个人民的义务，并可根据不同情况，不同环境，在爱国公约中订立保密条款，使保密工作成为广泛群众性的工作。经过这样的运动之后，即可将这一工作转向经常化，并不断进行认真的细致的检查，使国家机密，能够确保无失。
    保守国家机密制度的建立，是一个历史性的任务，也是全国人民思想建设上的巨大工程。《保守国家机密暂行条例》的制定，已经给这一工作指明了方向，但这还只是事情的开端，此后还必须进行一系列的工作。希望全国人民，首先是全体国家工作人员一致动员起来，为建立统一的、国家规模的保密工作，为确保国家机密而斗争！
