　　Small Library in Taipingzhuang, Kaitong County
    The small library in Taipingzhuang, Kaitong County, Heilongjiang Province, has raised the political awareness, production knowledge, and cultural level of the peasants. The library was awarded at the Northeast China Library Work Conference this year. Now I will tell you about the situation of this library.
    The Taipingzhuang Library was established in 1949 through voluntary fundraising. At that time, it had 187 popular booklets and comic books with new content, including common sense of production, celebrity stories, and maternal and infant hygiene. These books were placed in the village office and managed by a management committee composed of the village government chairman, primary school teachers, propagandists, and the women's association director. Primary school teachers were responsible for purchasing books and organizing peasants to read and listen to books.
    Out of 158 people in the village, 83 people regularly borrowed books, and 21 people could retell the content after reading. These 21 people often told stories to illiterate and semi-literate people in the village, filling the whole village with an atmosphere of cultural learning. Many of the books in the library are closely related to the lives of the peasants. After reading the books, the peasants gained a lot of help, so they were very happy to read and listen to books. For example, the child born to peasant Jia Tiantai's wife "appeared dead." According to the old midwife, the child could not be saved. But Jia Tiantai had read books on maternal and infant hygiene and told the midwife to hold the baby upside down and gently pat him on the back twice. The child immediately cried. This event caused a sensation in the village, and everyone said: "It's really good to run a library. Spend a little money, read a lot of books, and do big things."
    In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the library also played a certain role. Village cadres bought many books promoting the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, so that the masses in the whole village were educated in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. After reading the book "A Brief History of China in the Last Hundred Years," peasant Gai Chengjiu said: "Only now do I understand the significance of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. The American devils have been invading us for more than a day or two. They have been invading us for a hundred years." Since then, he has actively explained this truth to the masses, improving everyone's patriotism and hatred for US imperialism.
    The Taipingzhuang Library closely serves production. This is the main reason why the library can be consolidated and developed.
    In the vast rural areas of Northeast China, there are already nearly 5,000 such libraries. This shows the urgent need of the broad masses of peasants to study politics and culture after the land reform. These libraries are a huge force for improving the political and cultural level of the peasants.

　  开通县太平庄的小型图书室
    黑龙江省开通县太平庄的小型图书室，提高了农民的政治觉悟、生产知识和文化水平。该室曾在今年东北区图书馆工作会议上受到奖励。现在我把这个图书室的情况告诉你们。
    太平庄图书室是在一九四九年自愿集资建立的。当时，共有生产常识，名人故事、妇婴卫生等通俗小册子及新内容的连环画一百八十七册。这些图书都放在村办公室中，由村政府主席、小学教员、宣传员、妇女会主任等组织的管理委员会管理。小学教员负责添购书籍，并组织农民读书、听书。
    该村共一百五十八人，经常借书的有八十三人，看了书能把内容讲出来的有二十一人。这二十一人经常向村中的文盲、半文盲讲书，使全村充满了学习文化的空气。图书室中很多书籍内容都和农民生活有很密切的关系，农民们看了书，得到很多帮助，所以都很欢喜看书、听书。如农民贾天太的妻子生的小孩，“假死”了。根据旧接生婆的说法，这孩子没法救了。但贾天太看过关于妇婴卫生的书籍，就告诉接生婆把婴儿倒提起来，在他背上轻轻拍了两下。孩子立刻就会哭了。这件事轰动了全村，大家都说：“办图书室这件事真好，花一点儿钱，看很多书，办大事情。”
    在抗美援朝运动中，图书室也起了一定的作用。村干部买了很多宣传抗美援朝运动的书籍，使全村群众都受到抗美援朝的教育。农民盖成久看了《中国近百年史话》一书后说：“我这才明白了抗美援朝的意义。美国鬼子侵略我们并不是一天半天的事了，一百年来就一直侵略我们。”此后，他就积极向群众讲解这个道理，提高了大家的爱国热情和对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    太平庄图书室紧密地为生产服务，这是该图书室能够巩固、发展的主要原因。
    在东北广大农村，已有近五千个这样的图书室。这说明了广大农民在土地改革后学习政治、文化的迫切要求。这些图书室是提高农民政治、文化的一个巨大力量。                东北人民出版社  禾果
