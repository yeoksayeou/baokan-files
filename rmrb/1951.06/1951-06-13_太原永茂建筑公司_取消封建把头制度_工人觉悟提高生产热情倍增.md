Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company

    Abolishes Feudal Foremen System
　　Workers' Awareness Increases, Production Enthusiasm Doubles
    Workers at the Taiyuan Municipal Publicly-Operated Yongmao Construction Company, while constructing factory buildings for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, implemented a piece-rate wage system for small groups, abolished the foremen system, and established a trade union organization at the construction site. Under the leadership of the trade union, they launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign to resist America and aid Korea, greatly increasing production efficiency.
    In 1950, Yongmao Construction Company relied on "group leaders" for project management. "Group leaders" controlled a portion of the workers, severing the direct link between administration and workers, which was essentially feudal control. After the construction trade union launched a movement to abolish the feudal contracting system, the workers' awareness greatly increased, and they exposed many unreasonable facts. At the time, administrative cadres found it difficult to accept, believing that "the trade union is prejudiced" and "looking for trouble," forming a situation of opposition between the administration and the trade union. These ideas of the administration were mainly due to insufficient understanding of the workers' hardships, lack of communication between higher and lower levels, and obstruction by the foremen. After a period of struggle and practical proof, administrative leaders deeply realized the seriousness of the feudal foremen hindering production and decided to establish direct relationships with workers and abolish the foremen system. With the cooperation of the administrative trade union, a small group collective piece-rate wage system was initially implemented in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant factory building project.
    Yongmao Construction Company first divided the 235 participants in the construction into 15 groups according to the nature of the production. The administrative side signed collective piece-rate contracts (piece-rate orders) with each group and implemented a collective piece-rate wage system for small groups. Based on the individual wage standard per workday and the actual number of workdays, the wages each person should receive within half a month were calculated. From the 1st to the 3rd and the 16th to the 18th of each month, the company sent an accountant to the construction site to directly distribute the wages to each worker. After the project within the piece-rate contract was completed, the individual bonuses were evaluated based on the number of workdays saved (i.e., the surplus), the individual wage standard, and the number of workdays.
    After workers were freed from feudal constraints, their production enthusiasm doubled, and they were full of vigor. They established a trade union at the construction site and, under the leadership of the trade union, formulated a patriotic pact and launched a labor emulation campaign, significantly improving project progress.
    As production increased, the workers' lives also improved. In less than two months, the carpenters' group received bonuses equivalent to forty workdays per person.

　　太原永茂建筑公司        
    取消封建把头制度            
　　工人觉悟提高生产热情倍增
    太原市公营永茂建筑公司工人在建筑太原钢铁厂厂房工程中，实行了小组计件工资制，取消了把头制度；并在工地建立了工会组织，在工会领导下展开了抗美援朝的爱国主义劳动竞赛，生产效率大为提高。
    一九五零年永茂建筑公司在工程经营上是依靠“组长”。“组长”把持着一部分工人，隔绝了行政与工人的直接联系，实质是封建把持。经过建筑工会开展废除封建包工制运动后，工人觉悟大大提高了，揭发了许多不合理的事实。当时行政干部表现难于接受，认为“工会有成见”；“找麻烦”等等，形成行政与工会对立的现象。行政方面这些想法，主要是对工人疾苦不够了解，上下不通气，中间被把头所遮掩。经过一个时期的斗争和实际证明，行政领导干部深刻认识到了封建把头妨碍生产的严重性，决定与工人直接发生各种关系，取消把头制。在行政工会配合下，于钢铁厂厂房工程中，初步实行小组集体计件工资制。
    永茂建筑公司首先根据生产性质，把参加施工的二百三十五人分为十五个小组，行政方面和每个小组签订集体计件合同（计件订单），实行小组集体计件工资。根据个人每工工资标准、实际工作日数结算出每人在半月内应得工资，于每月一日至三日，十六日至十八日由公司派会计去工地直接发到每个工人手中，等到计件合同内的工程完成后，再根据所节省的工数（即超额部分之红利），个人的工资标准，工作日数等评议出个人应得之红利。
    工人们摆脱封建束缚后，生产热情倍增，生气勃勃，在工地建立了工会，在工会领导下订立爱国公约，展开了劳动竞赛，工程进度显著提高。
    随着生产的提高，工人生活也提高了，木工组工人不到两个月时间，每人得到了四十个工的红利。
