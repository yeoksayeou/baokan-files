    The Great Wall is a great building of our country, no one can arbitrarily demolish it
    To the Editor:
    In April of this year, I went to work in the area at the foot of the Great Wall in the Second District of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, and saw a lot of bricks dismantled from the Great Wall piled up in Maojiachang Village and Taoyuan Village in that district. Some families have already used these bricks to build houses or for other purposes. It is said that the bricks in Maojiachang Village were dismantled from a section near Shatuoyu of the Great Wall, and the bricks used in Taoyuan Village were dismantled from the Dayangkou area of the Great Wall; in these two places, some sections of the city wall have been demolished, leaving only the stone foundations.
    The Great Wall is a building of historical value. The local people's government should take proper care to protect it. Hope relevant authorities pay attention.

    长城是我国的伟大建筑  任何人不能任意拆毁编辑同志：
    今年四月，我到河北省遵化县二区长城根下一带去工作，见到该区毛家厂村和桃园村堆着不少从长城上拆下来的砖。有的人家已用这些砖盖房或作其他使用。据说：毛家厂村的砖，是由长城的沙坨峪附近一段拆下来的，桃园村用的砖是由长城的大洋口一带拆下来的；这两处的城墙，有的地方已经被拆得只剩了石基。
    长城是一个有历史价值的建筑。当地人民政府应妥加保护。希望有关机关注意。
