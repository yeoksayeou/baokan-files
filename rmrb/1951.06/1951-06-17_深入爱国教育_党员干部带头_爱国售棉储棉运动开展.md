　　Deepen Patriotic Education, Party Member Cadres Take the Lead
    Patriotic Cotton Selling and Storage Campaign Launched

Editor's Note: The materials on cotton selling and storage from several villages published here illustrate a basic principle: as long as leadership is strengthened and peasants are earnestly educated in patriotism, they will love their country and enthusiastically respond to the call of the state. Many cotton farmers have already demonstrated their deep affection for the country through their actions in the cotton selling and storage campaign. Leading cadres at all levels should concentrate this patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants and use concrete and vivid facts to further educate the broad masses of peasants, raising their political awareness a step further through the cotton selling and storage campaign.

    The exemplary role of Party member cadres is key to launching the cotton selling and storage campaign. The materials published here show that in villages where the campaign is deeply rooted, it is driven by the exemplary actions of Party members and cadres. The active participation and leadership of Party members and cadres in this campaign will raise their own political standing and strengthen their relationship with the broad masses.

　　深入爱国教育·党员干部带头        
    爱国售棉储棉运动开展编者按：这里刊载的几个村庄售棉储棉的材料，说明了一个基本的道理，即：只要加强领导，认真地对农民进行爱国主义的教育，农民是热爱自己的国家，并能热烈响应国家号召的。许多棉农在售棉储棉运动中，已经用实际行动，表现了自己对于国家的深切的感情。各级领导干部应该把农民这种爱国热情集中起来，以具体生动的事实，进一步教育广大农民。经过售棉储棉运动，把广大农民的政治觉悟提高一步。
    党员干部的模范作用，是开展售棉储棉运动的关键。这里刊载的材料说明，凡是运动深入的村庄，都是党员、干部以模范行动带动起来的。党员、干部积极参加与领导这个运动，将使自己在政治上提高一步，将使自己和广大群众的关系更加密切。
