　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th. The newspapers and other periodicals of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe are preparing special issues to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
　　In recent years, the countries of Eastern Europe have translated many important documents of the Communist Party of China and the works of Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the CPC. Some have been published in periodicals, and some have been printed as separate editions. These include Chairman Mao's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "On New Democracy," "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On Practice," as well as Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" and "On Internationalism and Nationalism." These works have been published in the millions and have sold out immediately. For example, 100,000 copies of the Czech version of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" have been printed since last year.
　　In Bulgaria, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party has notified organizations at all levels to use Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" as important propaganda material and teaching material. Cadres of the municipal committee of the new industrial city of Dimitrovgrad in Bulgaria recently told this agency that they are studying and discussing Chairman Mao's "On Practice" in detail, and are linking this study with their daily work.
　　Two months ago, the Romanian Academy of Sciences held a meeting where academicians pointed out that "On Practice" is one of the most important Marxist-Leninist documents and proposed it as research material for the academicians.
　　In Czechoslovakia, Chairman Mao's works are used as teaching and discussion materials in Party schools. To commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, a booklet entitled "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" has now been published. This book is compiled based on the essay "The Communist Party of China in the Struggle for Independence and Democracy," written by the Soviet writer Voytinsky and published in 1950. The cover of this book is printed with a Chinese slogan painting: "Advance under the Banner of Mao Zedong."
　　In Poland, Hungary, and Albania, the works of the CPC leaders are among the most popular books for cadres and the general masses of the workers' parties in these countries. Deran, a female engineer at the Danube Iron and Steel Plant in Hungary, said: "I bought the Selected Works of Mao Zedong as soon as it was published, and I have studied it carefully."

　　东欧人民民主国家大量出版毛主席著作
    各种报刊准备出特刊纪念中国共产党成立三十周年
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】东欧各人民民主国家的共产党与工人党的机关报及其他期刊，都在准备出特刊来纪念中国共产党成立三十周年。
    近年来，东欧各国已把中国共产党的许多重要文献和毛泽东主席及中共其他领袖的著作翻译出来，有的在期刊上发表，有的印成了单行本。其中包括毛主席的《中国革命与中国共产党》、《新民主主义论》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《目前形势和我们的任务》、《论人民民主专政》、《实践论》；以及刘少奇的《论党》和《论国际主义与民族主义》。这些著作已出版了千千万万册，一下就售完了。例如毛主席的《论人民民主专政》捷克文本，自去年以来已印行了十万册。
    在保加利亚，保加利亚共产党中央委员会已通知各级组织，采用毛主席的《论人民民主专政》作为重要的宣传资料和教材。保加利亚的新工业城市季米特洛夫城的市委会干部最近告本社记者说：他们正在详细地研究和讨论毛主席的《实践论》，并且把这种学习与他们的日常工作联系起来。
    两个月前，罗马尼亚科学院开会，院士们指出《实践论》是一种最重要的马列主义文献，并且提出来作为院士们的研究材料。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，毛主席的著作被采用作为党校讲授和讨论的教材。为了纪念中国共产党成立三十周年，现在已出版了一本小册子，题名为《中国共产党的三十年》。这本书是根据一九五○年发表的苏联作家沃伊丁斯基所著的论文《为中国独立和民主而斗争的中国共产党》编译的。这本书的封面上印着一帧中文标语画：《在毛泽东的旗帜下前进》。
    在波兰、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚，中共领袖们的著作是这些国家工人党的干部和一般群众最欢迎的书的一种。匈牙利多瑙铁厂的女工程师德兰说：“毛泽东选集一出版我就买了，我已用心地研读了它。”
