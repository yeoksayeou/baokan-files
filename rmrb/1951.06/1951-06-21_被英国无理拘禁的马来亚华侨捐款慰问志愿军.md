Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: More than 300 overseas Chinese, unjustly detained by the British colonial government of Malaya in a concentration camp in Malaya, wrote letters and donated funds to express their condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In their letter of condolence, they said: "We are unjustly detained in concentration camps by the British colonial authorities, deprived of freedom and happiness, and subjected to all kinds of maltreatment. We are indignant at the barbaric and unreasonable oppression of British imperialism. We are concerned about the new motherland and the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army who are defending the motherland and world peace. Therefore, we have raised RMB 2,152,750 and sent it to you as a token of our appreciation. We wish you an early completion of the task of driving out the American invading bandits!"

　　被英国无理拘禁的马来亚华侨捐款慰问志愿军
    【新华社广州十九日电】被马来亚英国殖民政府无理拘禁在马来亚某地集中营里的华侨三百多人写信和捐款慰劳中国人民志愿军。他们在慰问信里说：“我们被英国殖民当局无理拘禁在集中营里，丧失了自由和幸福，遭受种种虐待。我们愤恨英帝国主义野蛮无理的压迫。我们关心着新生的祖国，关心着为保卫祖国和世界和平的志愿军指挥员、战斗员同志们。因此，我们筹集了人民币二百一十五万二千七百五十元，寄上慰劳你们。祝你们早日完成驱逐美国侵略强盗的任务！”
