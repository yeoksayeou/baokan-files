Comrades, patriotic men and women from all walks of life across the country:

Our great Chinese people's movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has achieved tremendous victories and successes thanks to the concerted efforts of all sectors of society and the heroic struggles of all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. Now, in order to further develop and deepen the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea more universally throughout the country, to strengthen national defense, and to strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army so that they can more effectively coordinate with the Korean People's Army to strike at the American invading bandits and achieve the final victory of the war as soon as possible to defend our country, defend Asia and world peace, we hereby put forward the following appeal to everyone, and hope that everyone will respond enthusiastically:

One, widely carry out the patriotic pledge movement. In this great anti-imperialist upsurge, the masses of people from all walks of life in various places have already established thousands upon thousands of patriotic pledges. These pledges are a concrete manifestation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a concrete program of patriotic action for each pledge-making unit. It closely integrates the daily business, production, work, and study of people from all walks of life with the overall task of patriotism, with the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate the feudal land system, making it a united march of the vast majority of people. It is an important form of combining the common activities of people from all walks of life. Our people across the country must seize this form, make full use of this form, to improve our unity, to improve our patriotic movement, to improve our movement to resist America and aid Korea, and to promote our production, work, study, and other revolutionary struggles and construction undertakings.

We suggest that all people from all walks of life, all factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets, and rural areas, all workshops, production teams, and study groups in factories, all kinds of production mutual aid groups and study groups in rural areas, all work departments in institutions, all departments or classes and groups in schools, and even all families and other production and work units, etc., according to their own business, and around the movement to resist America and aid Korea, formulate specific patriotic pledges, or add to the original pledges; and elect leaders to establish a permanent leadership core to lead everyone to realize these pledges.

We suggest that competition movements to realize patriotic pledges be carried out among pledge-making units of similar nature. And in January next year, the results of this patriotic competition will be generally checked, the merits will be evaluated, models will be rewarded, to ensure that the pledges made by everyone can be fully realized.

Two, launch a movement to donate airplanes and cannons. According to reports from the front lines, and according to reports from our delegation to Korea, the combat effectiveness of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army can completely overwhelm the enemy in all aspects, the only difficulty is that our airplanes, cannons, and other weapons are not enough. In order to enable our heroic and skilled Volunteer Army to eliminate more enemies with less sacrifice and achieve the final victory of the war as soon as possible, we must quickly supply more airplanes, cannons, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns, and other weapons to the front lines. We suggest that all patriotic compatriots from all walks of life across the country, regardless of gender or age, launch a patriotic movement to increase production and increase income, and use part or all of the newly increased income to purchase airplanes, cannons, and other weapons to donate to the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army to strengthen their power and consolidate our national defense. The airplanes, cannons, tanks, etc. donated from various places will be named after the donating units as a glorious memorial (the Association will issue a separate specific notice on the issue of donating weapons).

Three, do a good job in preferential treatment work. The commanders, fighters, and staff of our great People's Volunteer Army, People's Liberation Army, and Public Security Armed Forces have enthusiastically and heroically left their families to gloriously join the army and engage in bloody struggles for the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, defending their homes and country, or suppressing counter-revolutionaries domestically, that is, for the sake of all of us. Some commanders and fighters have gloriously dedicated their lives for our common cause, or lost their health and become disabled. Our people across the country should be responsible for them and should conscientiously and regularly do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers and to disabled soldiers. In rural areas, we must do a good job of substitute farming in a timely manner, and in cities, we must help their families find employment. Whether in cities or in rural areas, we must help their children enroll in schools and help their families solve various difficulties. In order to ensure that this work is done regularly, we hope that all people's organizations will assist governments at all levels to mobilize, supervise, and inspect the work of preferential treatment on a regular basis; we suggest that the people's representative conferences of counties, cities, and districts pay attention to this work!

The patriotic movement to increase production and donate weapons and the work of preferential treatment should be included in the patriotic pledges of each unit and become its important content.

In order to do these tasks well, to make the movement to resist America and aid Korea in-depth and regularized, we suggest that all cities and counties across the country convene a representative conference or working conference on resisting America and aiding Korea in June to formulate a propaganda and education plan for doing these tasks well and the entire movement to resist America and aid Korea in the second half of this year, and implement it.

Comrades, patriotic men and women from all walks of life across the country! Now our war to resist America and aid Korea is at a fierce and critical stage. On the one hand, we have continuously given the American aggressors a series of severe blows and achieved brilliant victories; on the other hand, we still have to vigorously overcome some serious difficulties before us in order to completely eliminate the enemy and liberate the entire territory of Korea. Regarding the corruption, barbarity, ugliness, and shameless crimes of the imperialist aggressors, and regarding the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people constantly overcoming difficulties, striking at the enemy, annihilating the enemy, and winning victories, the delegation to Korea that has recently returned from the front line will go to various cities, counties, and banners across the country to give you detailed reports. We hope that everyone will highly promote the enthusiasm of patriotism, continue to develop the patriotic pledge movement, launch the movement to increase production, donate weapons, and provide preferential treatment, in order to more powerfully support the front lines and strive for the final victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea.

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会
    关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召全国各界男女爱国同胞们：
    我们伟大的中国人民的抗美援朝运动，由于全国各界的一致努力，志愿军全体指战员的英勇斗争，已经取得了巨大的胜利和成绩。现在为了进一步在全国更普遍地发展与深入抗美援朝运动，为了加强国防，加强支援中国人民志愿军，使他们更有力地配合朝鲜人民军打击美国侵略强盗，早日取得战争的最后胜利，以保卫我们的国家，保卫亚洲和世界的和平，我们谨向大家提出以下的号召，希望大家一致热烈地响应：
    一、普遍开展爱国公约运动。在这次伟大的反对帝国主义的高潮中，各地各界群众已经订立了成千成万的爱国公约。这些公约，是中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的具体化，是各订约单位的一种具体的爱国行动纲领。它使各阶层人民把自己的日常业务，生产、工作和学习与爱国的总任务，与抗美援朝、镇压反革命和消灭封建土地制度的斗争，密切结合起来，成为绝大多数人民步伐整齐的进军；它是结合各阶层人民共同活动的一种重要的形式。我们全国人民要抓紧这种形式，充分运用这种形式，来把我们的团结提高，把我们的爱国运动，把我们的抗美援朝运动提高，并且推进我们的生产、工作和学习及其他各项革命斗争和建设事业。
    我们建议全国所有各界人民、各工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道和农村，工厂中的各个车间、生产组和学习组，乡村中的各种生产互助组、学习组，机关中的各个工作部门，学校中各个院系或班、组，以至各个家庭和其他各种生产工作单位等，都按照自己的业务，围绕着抗美援朝运动，订出具体的爱国公约，或增订原来的公约；并且选出领导人，建立经常的领导核心，领导大家来实现这些公约。
    我们建议在性质相近的订约单位间，开展实现爱国公约的竞赛运动。并于明年一月普遍检查这种爱国竞赛的结果，评定优劣，奖励模范，以保证大家所订立的公约，能够圆满地实现。
    二、开展捐献飞机大炮运动。根据前线的报告，根据我们的赴朝慰问团回来的报告，我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战斗力，在一切方面都能完全压倒敌人，困难的只是我们的飞机大炮等武器还不够多。为了使我们英勇善战的志愿军，能够以更小的牺牲，消灭更多的敌人，早日取得战争的最后胜利，我们必须迅速以更多的飞机、大炮、坦克、高射炮、反坦克炮等武器供给前线。我们建议全国各界爱国同胞们，不分男女老少，都开展爱国的增加生产、增加收入的运动，用新增加的收入的一部或全部，购置飞机、大炮等武器，捐献给志愿军和解放军，来加强他们的威力，巩固我们的国防。各地捐献的飞机、大炮、坦克等，将冠以捐献单位的名字，作为光荣的纪念（关于捐献武器问题，本会另有具体通知）。
    三、做好优抚工作。我们的伟大的人民志愿军、人民解放军和公安武装的指战员和工作人员们，是为了抗美援朝、保家卫国或在国内肃清反革命，即为了我们大家，才踊跃英勇地离开了家庭，光荣地参加了军队，进行流血的斗争。有些指战员为了我们的共同事业，已经光荣地捐献了自己的生命，或者丧失了健康，变成了残废。我们全国人民应该对他们负责，应该切实而经常地做好优待烈属、军属，优待残废军人的工作。在乡村中要及时做好代耕工作，在城市中要帮助他们的家属就业。无论在城市和乡村，我们都要帮助他们的子女入学，帮助他们的家庭解决各种困难。为了保证经常做好这种工作，我们希望各人民团体协助各级政府，对优抚工作，定期加以动员、督促与检查；建议县、市及区的各界人民代表会议注意这项工作！
    爱国增产捐献武器运动和优抚工作，都应该订入各单位的爱国公约，并且成为它的重要内容。
    为了做好这些工作，为了使抗美援朝运动深入和经常化，我们建议全国各市、县都在六月份内召开一次抗美援朝代表会议或工作会议，来制订在今年下半年内做好这些工作及整个抗美援朝运动的宣传教育计划，并加以贯彻。
    全国各界男女爱国同胞们！现在我们的抗美援朝战争，正处在剧烈紧要的阶段。一方面，我们已经连续地给了美国侵略者一系列的严重打击，取得了辉煌的胜利；另一方面，尚须大力克服摆在我们面前的一些严重困难，才能彻底消灭敌人，解放朝鲜全境。关于帝国主义侵略者的腐败、野蛮、丑恶、无耻的罪行，关于英勇的中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民不断克服困难、打击敌人、歼灭敌人，着着胜利的情形，新近从前线归来的赴朝慰问团，即将分赴全国各市、各县、各旗去向你们作详细的报告。我们希望大家高度地发扬爱国主义的热忱，再接再厉地发展爱国公约运动，开展增产捐献武器和优抚运动，以便更加有力地支援前线，争取抗美援朝战争的最后胜利。
