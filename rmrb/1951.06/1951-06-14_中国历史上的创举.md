　　A Groundbreaking Undertaking in Chinese History
    To help farmers eliminate locusts, the Central People's Government has dispatched four aircraft to northern Anhui Province to carry out locust extermination work. This is an unprecedented undertaking in our country's history.
    Chinese and foreign reactionaries have always used airplanes to massacre the Chinese people, while the People's Government uses airplanes to massacre locusts. This is another stark contrast.
    Locust extermination work is directly for the benefit of farmers. After leading farmers to implement land reform, the People's Government is leading farmers to restore and develop production. Furthermore, for the sake of farmers' production, the People's Government has begun to use modern technology such as airplanes to help farmers overcome potential locust plagues. Obviously, this would be impossible without a people's government. This spring, the People's Government dispatched airplanes to bomb the ice dam on the Yellow River within Suiyuan Province, which has the same significance.
    Farmers across the country should recognize the greatness of the motherland and the Central People's Government's concern for the interests of the broad masses of farmers from this event, thereby loving our country, supporting the People's Government, supporting the Chinese Communist Party, and should devote all their efforts to defend and build their new country.

　　中国历史上的创举
    为了帮助农民消灭蝗虫，中央人民政府已派遣飞机四架飞赴皖北，进行灭蝗工作，这在我国历史上还是一个创举。
    中外反动派从来是用飞机屠杀中国人民，而人民政府则用飞机去屠杀蝗虫。这又是一个鲜明的对照。
    灭蝗工作直接是为了农民的利益。人民政府在领导农民实行土地改革之后，即领导农民恢复和发展生产，又为了农民的生产，人民政府已开始运用飞机这样现代化的技术，帮助农民战胜可能的蝗灾。很显然，不是人民的政府，是不可能这样办的。今年春天，人民政府派遣飞机，轰炸绥远境内黄河冰坝，与此有同样意义。
    全国农民应该从这件事情认识到祖国的伟大，中央人民政府对广大农民利益的关怀，因而热爱我们的国家，拥护人民政府，拥护中国共产党，并应尽自己一切力量，以保卫和建设自己新的国家。
