　　Self-Criticism in Connection with the Criticism of Wu Xun
　　Guo Moruo
　　The discussion about the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a very good ideological education exercise. It connects dialectical materialism and historical materialism with practical problems in a concrete way, greatly enlightening many readers. I myself am one who has been deeply enlightened.

　　Up to this day, I have read almost all the criticisms of "The Life of Wu Xun" that I could access. I think Mr. Xie Xingyao's "Wu Xun, the Person and His Deeds" (People's Daily, May 30th) is written more concretely, especially the attached "Chronology of Major Domestic Events Centered on North China During Wu Xun's Activities" and "Statement of Income and Expenditure of Wu Xun's Donation for Establishing Schools," which allow people to clearly understand the truth about Wu Xun at a glance.

　　I only learned about Wu Xun's existence during the Anti-Japanese War in Chongqing, after Mr. Tao Xingzhi praised him. I never studied him in depth. However, I was invited to speak at a Wu Xun memorial meeting hosted by Mr. Tao in 1943, and I blindly praised him then. When Mr. Tao passed away in Shanghai in 1947, I mentioned Wu Xun in my eulogy, saying that Mr. Tao was better than Wu Xun. (The original poem was included in "Cicada Collection," but since I don't have the book at hand, I cannot quote the original words.)

　　I made a mistake, mainly because I didn't look at Wu Xun from an essential perspective, and I viewed him in isolation. Furthermore, I didn't connect him with the revolutionary movements of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion. Today, Wu Xun's essence has been clarified, and the historical facts of the peasant revolution during Wu Xun's activities have also been revealed, which fully proves Wu Xun's backwardness, reaction, and even counter-revolution. To praise such a person is indeed a serious mistake.

　　What I should not have done most is to inscribe the title for "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun" – which can be said to be a sister of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" – and also write a preface:
	“In the old society, where people sucked others' blood to fatten themselves, Wu Xun's appearance was a miracle. Coming from a poor background, he knew the importance of education. He relied on begging, collected money to establish schools, and sacrificed himself for others, which is rare. But that cannot solve the problem. It is okay to cherish it as a miracle, but in the new democratic society, such miracles will no longer appear. (August 11th)”

　　That was on August 11th last year. Mr. Li Shizhao, the editor of the "Illustrated Biography," had written to me earlier, saying that he had finished his studies at the Revolutionary University, and that the "Illustrated Biography" he compiled would be serialized in the "Guangming Daily" (but for some reason, this did not happen later), and asked me to write a title and some comments. I reluctantly complied, which was indeed my mistake. At that time, I should have taken responsibility and dissuaded the publication of "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun." Not only did I not dissuade it, but I even did my best to help promote it.

　　Although my inscription contained some critical elements and provoked the editor to refute me in his preface, the criticism was far from enough. Moreover, basically, it still affirmed Wu Xun as a person, and the basic reason for this was that I did not fully know about Wu Xun's deeds. Giving out usurious loans to establish schools, and the schools established were meant to allow the landlord class to "have their sons and grandsons ride in sedan chairs generation after generation," what is there to "cherish" or what is "rare" about this? Wu Xun not only had no intention of "solving the problem" – liberating the people, but he was instead increasing the problem, making the problem more difficult to solve – making it more difficult for the people to liberate themselves. What kind of "miracle" is that? For counter-revolutionaries to maintain the rule of the landlord class in feudal society is originally an extremely common thing.

　　Wu Xun in the late Qing Dynasty and Wu Zhihui during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are generally the same type of people, although they are in different historical stages, and their levels of knowledge cannot be compared. However, Wu Zhihui is easy to recognize, while Wu Xun is relatively difficult to recognize. The reason is that Wu Xun is far away from our era, the historical truth is blurred, and without further study, it is even easier to be blinded by some superficial acts of hardship. Therefore, Wu Xun's exemplary enslavement education is, in fact, even more worthy of condemnation than enslavement education itself.

　　Through this discussion, I have been greatly enlightened. I have made up my mind to thoroughly correct the old habits of the petty bourgeoisie, such as speaking casually without careful research, and writing titles and inscriptions for others casually without careful consideration. I sincerely apologize to the friends who have read "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun."

　　联系着武训批判的自我检讨
    郭沫若
    关于电影《武训传》的讨论是一件很好的思想教育工作，把辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义和实际问题具体地联系了起来，使很多读者受到了很大的启发。我自己也就是深受启发的一个。
    一直到今天为止，凡是我所能接触到的有关《武训传》的批评文字，我差不多都读到了。我觉得谢兴尧先生的《武训其人其事》（《人民日报》五月三十日）写得比较具体，特别是所附的“武训活动时期以华北为中心的国内大事表”及“武训捐资兴学收支表”，使人们对于武训的真相可以一目了然。
    武训的存在，我是在抗战时期的重庆，经过陶行知先生的表彰，才开始知道的。我一直不曾加以研究。但在一九四三年陶先生所主持的一个武训纪念会上应邀讲话，便也曾盲目地称赞过他。一九四七年陶先生在上海逝世，我在吊诗里面曾经提到武训，而说陶先生比武训更好。（原诗被收入《蜩螗集》，因手中无书，原语无从引出。）
    我是犯了错误，主要的原因是不曾从本质上去看武训，而且把他孤立地看了，更不曾把他和太平天国与捻军的革命运动联系起来看。今天武训的本质被阐明了，武训活动当时的农民革命的史实也昭示了出来，便十足证明武训的落后、反动、甚至反革命了。对于这样的人而加以称颂，的确是犯了严重的错误。
    我最不应该的是替《武训画传》——可以说是电影《武训传》的姊妹，题了书名，还题了辞：
        “在吮吸别人的血以养肥自己的旧社会里面，武训的出现是一个奇迹
    。他以贫苦出身，知道教育的重要，靠着乞讨，敛金兴学，舍己为人，是
    很难得的。但那样也解决不了问题。作为奇迹珍视是可以的，新民主主义
    的社会里面，不会再有这样的奇迹出现了。（八月十一日）”
    那是去年八月十一日的事。《画传》的编者李士钊先生早就写信来说：他在革大的学习结束了，他编的《画传》要在《光明日报》上连载（不知怎的后来并无此事），要我题个书名并写点意见。我勉强地应付了，这实是我的错误。我当时是应该负起责任来，劝阻《武训画传》的出版的，不仅没有劝阻，反而尽了帮助宣扬的能事。
    虽然我的题辞多少含有批判的成分，并惹得编者在他的自序中驳斥了我，但批判得十分不够。而且在基本上还是肯定了武训其人，而其基本的原因也就由于并不十分知道武训其事。放高利贷来兴学，所兴的学又是要叫地主阶级“子子孙孙坐八抬大轿”的，这有什么值得“珍视”，有什么“很难得”呢？武训不仅没有意思“解决问题”——使老百姓翻身，他反而在增加问题，使问题更不容易解决——使老百姓更不容易翻身。这又算得什么“奇迹”呢？反革命者在封建社会里要维持地主阶级的统治，这本来是极其寻常的事。
    满清末年的武训和蒋介石匪帮统治时期的吴稚晖，大体上是一个类型的人物，虽然他们所处的历史阶段不同，而知识水平也不能相比。但吴稚晖容易认识，而武训比较不容易认识，原因是武训和我们的时代相隔较远，历史的真相模糊了，而又不曾加以研究，那就更加容易为一些表面上的刻苦行为所蒙蔽了。因此，武训的以身作则的奴化教育，事实上是比奴化教育本身，尤其值得诅咒。
    经过了这一次的讨论，我是受了很大的启发的。没有经过仔细的研究随便发言，没有经过慎重的考虑随便替人题辞题字，这种不负责任的小资产阶级的老毛病，我已下定决心加以痛改。我诚恳地向读过《武训画传》的朋友们告罪。
                                      （一九五一年六月一日）
