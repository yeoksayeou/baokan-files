    Beijing Farmers Association Meeting Decides to Donate "Beijing Farmers" Airplane
    Guarantee Proper Treatment of Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel
    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing Farmers Association, in response to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, convened a joint meeting of the directors of farmers' associations in the suburban districts on June 4th to discuss how to mobilize farmers to continue promoting the patriotic compact movement; to strive to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons; and to do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel.

    In the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, 221 villages and streets in the suburbs have already established patriotic compacts. Some farmers have also established patriotic compacts for households and individuals. The Jin Xiuzhi mutual aid group in Shang'an Village, District Sixteen, has been performing very well in the two months since the five members established a plan to implement the patriotic compact. In the execution of patriotic compacts by farmers throughout the suburbs, there have been great achievements in river dredging, pest control, and drought resistance. They have also exposed 310 counter-revolutionaries. When the news of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea's call to donate airplanes and cannons reached the suburbs, many people inquired about the price of airplanes and cannons. Farmers in Mentou Village, District Thirteen, have already begun donating.

    Chai Zemin, Director of the Municipal Farmers Association, called out at the meeting: "In order to more effectively annihilate the enemy's forces, further consolidate our national defense, and support our volunteer army, we must launch a large donation movement in the suburbs and do a good job in preferential treatment. To further promote the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, we call on farmers to work hard to increase production and actively strive to donate a 'Beijing Farmers' airplane." The directors of the farmers' associations in each district unanimously responded to this call, deciding to mobilize all farmers to review and revise the patriotic compacts through the district and village Resist America and Aid Korea representative meetings; launch a patriotic production competition movement; donate a "Beijing Farmers" airplane from increased production; guarantee support for the army and preferential treatment, do a good job in substitute farming, and help the families of martyrs and military personnel solve various difficulties in production and life.

　　北京市农民协会开会决定
    捐献北京农民号飞机
    保证做好优待烈属军属工作
    【本报讯】北京市农民协会响应中国人民抗美援朝总会号召，在六月四日召集郊区各区农民协会主任联席会议，讨论如何动员农民继续推行爱国公约运动；努力增产，捐献飞机、大炮；做好优待烈属、军属工作。
    郊区农民在抗美援朝运动中，已有二百二十一个村、街订了爱国公约，有的农民还订了户和个人的爱国公约，十六区上岸村金秀芝互助组，五个人订了执行爱国公约的计划后，两个月来执行得很好。全郊区农民执行爱国公约中，在挖河、除虫、抗旱工作上，都有很大成绩，还检举了三百一十名反革命分子。当抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机、大炮的消息传到郊区时，很多人打听飞机、大炮的价钱。十三区门头村农民已经开始捐献。
    市农民协会主任柴泽民，在会上号召说：“为了更有效地歼灭敌人的有生力量，进一步巩固我们的国防，支援我们的志愿军，要在郊区展开一个大的捐献运动，并且做好优抚工作。使抗美援朝运动推进一步，号召农民努力增产，踊跃地为捐献‘北京农民号’飞机而努力。”各区农民协会主任，一致响应了这个号召，决定通过区、村抗美援朝代表会，动员全体农民检查和修订爱国公约；展开爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，从增加生产上捐献“北京农民号”飞机；保证拥军优属，做好代耕工作，帮助烈士和军人家属解决生产上和生活上的各种困难。
