    Zhi Huai Model Guan Ziyou
    Pay Attention to Political and Ideological Education of Migrant Workers
    Guan Ziyou is from Yan Zhai Township, Seventh District, Xi County, Henan Province. This spring, when the People's Government called on the people to participate in the Huai River project, he was the first to sign up and encouraged the villagers to sign up. He became the squad leader of the Huai River migrant worker team. When leading the migrant workers, he paid great attention to conducting political and ideological education for them. He said to the migrant workers: "Harnessing the Huai River is like fighting the local bullies; if the local bullies are not defeated, life will not be good. If the river is well harnessed and more grain is produced, it will be our farmers' practical action to resist America and aid Korea." Because of his good propaganda and education among the migrant workers, the migrant workers had a correct understanding of the Huai River project. The migrant workers said: "Eating the public's grain and doing our own work, how can we not do it well?" His squad of forty-eight people completed 2,227 cubic meters of earthwork in fifteen days. Especially in the case of lack of tools, he was able to find all means to overcome the difficulties. For example, without stone rollers, he used stone piers to make holes to replace the stone rollers; without hemp, he took out his own hemp for everyone to use. He encouraged the migrant workers to complete the task ahead of schedule, but also paid great attention to the quality of the project. When he saw that the project there was not up to standard, he always proposed to redo it. He often said to the migrant workers: "The Great Wall is afraid of a lack," "If one place is not done well, ten places will suffer." Guan Ziyou is also very concerned about the lives and health of the migrant workers, does not let the migrant workers drink cold water, does not let the migrant workers go down to the ditch to bathe, often helps the migrant workers wash clothes, dry quilts, and clean the living rooms, for fear that someone will get sick. Therefore, during the construction phase, not a single person in his squad was sick. He led everyone to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love. After the completion of the project in his own squad, he led everyone to help other migrant workers who had not completed it. Because the section of work he led was done well and quickly, and he was supported by everyone, he was named a model of river harnessing in the township at the model selection meeting held in the district; when he attended the county-wide celebration of labor models for Huai River harnessing, he was named a first-class Huai River harnessing model in the county. He will gloriously attend the celebration of labor models for Huai River harnessing in the entire special district.

    治淮模范管自友
    注意对民工的政治思想教育
    管自友是河南省息县第七区阎砦乡人。今年春天人民政府号召人民参加治淮，他首先报名参加，并鼓动全村群众报名参加。他当了治淮民工队的分队长。在领导民工工作时，他十分注意对民工进行政治思想教育。他向民工们说：“治淮河如同打恶霸一样，恶霸打不倒，日子过不好。治好了河，粮食打得多，就是我们农民参加抗美援朝的实际行动。”因为他对民工的宣传教育做得好，民工对治淮有正确的认识。民工们说：“吃公家的粮，做自己的事，那还能不好好的干吗。”他这一个分队四十八个人，在十五天内就完成了二千二百二十七方土，特别是在工具缺乏的情况下，他能想尽了一切办法来克服困难。例如，没有石硪，他便用石礅子掏成眼代替石硪；没有麻，他便把自己的麻拿出来给大家用。他鼓励民工提前完成任务，但也十分注意工程的质量，他要是看到那里的工程不合标准时，总是提出要重新做。他常向民工说：“万里长城怕一缺”，“一处做得不好，就有十处要遭殃。”管自友也很关心民工的生活和身体的健康，不叫民工喝冷水，不叫民工下沟洗澡，常常帮助民工洗衣服，晒被子，打扫住室，惟恐有人生病。因此，在施工阶段他这个分队没有一个病号。他带动大家发扬互助友爱精神，在本分队的工程完成后，就带领大家去帮助其他未完成的民工。因为他领导的工段，做得好做得快，自己也得到大伙的拥护，在区里召开的评选模范大会上，他被评为全乡治河模范；他参加全县治淮劳动模范庆功大会时，又被评为全县一等治淮模范，他将光荣地出席全专区治淮劳动模范庆功大会。
