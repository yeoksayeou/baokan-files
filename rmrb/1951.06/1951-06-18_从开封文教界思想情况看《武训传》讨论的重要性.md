The Importance of the Discussion of "The Story of Wu Xun" Seen from the Ideological Situation of the Cultural and Educational Circles in Kaifeng
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Liu Guoming

　　The first part of the film "The Story of Wu Xun" began showing in Kaifeng on May 2nd, and was shown a total of eleven times, with an estimated audience of at least 15,000 people. At that time, the Henan Provincial Primary Education Conference was being held in Kaifeng. The Provincial Department of Culture and Education specifically invited over 100 representatives from various special districts, cities, and counties to see it. All the students of the Kaifeng City Teacher Training Class also watched it collectively with the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. In addition, some organizations specially invited their Youth League members to see it on "May Fourth" Youth Day. At that time, critical articles had already been published in "Literary Gazette;" however, these "audiences" did not seriously discuss and criticize the film after watching it. Although the Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education already knew that "The Story of Wu Xun" had been criticized, they did not convey or introduce the criticism when organizing the viewing of "The Story of Wu Xun."

    At this time, the general public in Kaifeng, including many Communist Party members engaged in ideological education work, were not very concerned about the criticism of "The Story of Wu Xun;" this was a serious phenomenon of ideological sluggishness and lack of principle. The influence of the "Wu Xun Spirit" in Kaifeng was not insignificant. Before liberation, in January 1947, Kaifeng formally established the "Henan Wu Xun Education Association," and also painted two sets of large "Wu Xun Picture Stories" for long-term exhibition, ran two Wu Xun primary schools, and published many articles in newspapers. Even in the early days of liberation, some people wanted to hang a "Wu Xun Primary School" sign at the entrance of a municipal primary school. Most of the main initiators and directors of the former "Wu Xun Education Association" have been assigned to new democratic education posts and other posts. Some of them have not changed or have not completely changed their views on Wu Xun. As for the influence of the "Wu Xun Spirit" on ordinary intellectuals, it cannot be ignored.

    The People's Daily editorial on May 20th, "The Discussion of the Film 'The Story of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued" and the call in the Party Life column "Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Story of Wu Xun'," aroused the attention of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Kaifeng cultural and educational circles to this issue. Under the instruction of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education spent nearly two weeks collecting materials on the influence of "Wu Xun Thought" in Kaifeng and activities related to Wu Xun, and at the same time arranged for all primary school teachers and staff to study. On June 3rd, Feng Jihan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, based on the collected materials and specific circumstances, made an enlightening report to all primary school teachers and staff; then discussions and studies were launched under the unified leadership of the Academic Committee of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. There are more than 900 primary school teachers and staff in Kaifeng City, of which only a quarter graduated from schools after liberation or participated in short-term studies, and the rest are old intellectuals. During the study, because the leadership grasped the spirit of enlightening free discussion, all participants were able to express their true thoughts. According to reports, in the first week of study, the vast majority of teachers and staff (about three-quarters) expressed disagreement or incomplete agreement with the People's Daily editorial and the arguments criticizing Wu Xun. The Academic Committee of the Bureau of Culture and Education learned of as many as 36 different opinions; summarized, they mainly fall into the following types: 1. It is believed that Wu Xun begged for alms to establish schools for thirty years, and although he bought land and lent money at interest, he did not enjoy it himself. This kind of "hardship spirit" and "altruism" cannot be considered bad in the late Qing Dynasty, and cannot be considered worthless. 2. Wu Xun was born in a poor peasant family and received no education. He suffered a lifetime of torment to establish schools. Although the schools he ran served the landlords, it was due to historical limitations and he could not help it. Today, instead of sympathizing with his situation, we are attacking him vigorously, which is too cruel and harsh. 3. Wu Xun established free schools, which, in any case, allowed the peasants to learn some culture. If intellectuals from landlord families had not learned some culture with the help of their landlord families, could they participate in revolutionary work and contribute to the revolution today? 4. If Wu Xun is blamed for not participating in the Taiping Army and the Nian Army, then many intellectuals today only joined the work after liberation. There were liberated areas outside Kaifeng before liberation and underground parties in the city, but many intellectuals did not participate in the revolution. Shouldn't they be blamed even more harshly? 5. Although Wu Xun's begging for alms to establish schools objectively played a role in maintaining feudal rule, his subjective intention was good, to allow the laboring people to turn over. His good intentions should not be completely negated. Summarizing the views of these people, they are merely opposing subjective motivation and objective effect, confusing the general situation of people not participating in the revolutionary struggle with the situation of Wu Xun, who was praised as a "great figure of all time," actually opposing the revolutionary struggle at that time, and viewing education as isolated. Judging from this serious ideological confusion, it is not easy for the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education to basically solve the problem within the 20-day study period.

    Simultaneously with the discussions in the primary schools, teachers and staff of various secondary schools in Kaifeng City also began discussions under the leadership of the Cultural and Educational Trade Union. Wu Zhipu, reporter of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Provincial Government, made two reports at the beginning of this month to all representatives of the Provincial Cultural Work Conference and all teachers and staff of secondary schools and cadres of cultural and educational institutions in Kaifeng City to launch a critical attack on "The Story of Wu Xun." However, because the leadership was not concentrated and powerful enough, the development in secondary schools was relatively slow.

    Henan Daily's initial firepower in launching the criticism of "The Story of Wu Xun" was also not strong enough. Some comrades initially had the idea that if a manuscript criticizing work errors at the grassroots level was delayed by one day, the work would suffer one day's loss, so it must be issued early; while manuscripts criticizing "The Story of Wu Xun" could be issued later. This shows that some people do not fully appreciate the seriousness of the ideological struggle. Since Henan Daily published the People's Daily editorial and the two articles in Party Life on May 20th, it has received forty to fifty manuscripts regarding the discussion of "The Story of Wu Xun." The ideas expressed in the submitted manuscripts can be divided into three types: 1. Those who completely agree with the criticism of Wu Xun and conduct self-examination and criticism in connection with their own ideas, which is a minority; 2. Those who superficially agree with the criticism of Wu Xun, but have not solved the problem ideologically, this type is more numerous; 3. Only one person holds opposing views. In the second type of thinking, there are the following situations: 1. When criticizing Wu Xun, Yue Fei, Qu Yuan and Wu Xun are brought together, and it is believed that they are all accomplices of the feudal rulers, which is a "leftist" approach; 2. Some even more "leftist" opinions believe that if Wu Xun had not helped the Manchu Qing in culture, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army could have won; 3. It is thought that Wu Xun is just an accidental abnormality, so criticizing Wu Xun is also regarded as criticizing an abnormality, rather than criticizing from the entire feudal enslavement thought, which can be said to be a "rightist" view. The discussion in the newspaper is gradually unfolding, and letters from readers requesting to expand the discussion are also increasing.

    The Henan Provincial and Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles also held a symposium on the 12th to discuss the issue of launching a criticism of "The Story of Wu Xun" in literary and art circles. The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles decided to send discussion notices to the Federation of Literary and Art Circles in each special district and the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and to introduce the discussion experience of Kaifeng City; the Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education are preparing to collect various materials related to Wu Xun's activities in Kaifeng in the past and hold a small-scale exhibition to help the cultural and educational circles deeply understand this issue.

    Judging from the ideological situation reflected in the education circles, literary and art circles, and newspaper submissions, launching a discussion of "The Story of Wu Xun" and eliminating the influence of the reactionary "Wu Xun Spirit" is a very serious and arduous struggle at present. The Henan Provincial and Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Kaifeng Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Henan Daily initially thought when organizing this discussion that, since the People's Daily had published many critical articles, the discussion might be one-sided and unable to unfold. But the facts have proved that the "Wu Xun Spirit" has a certain degree of foundation among bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals or intellectuals from these two classes and the landlord class. This discussion can be deeply developed and must be deeply developed. Through this discussion, the bourgeois reactionary ideas that have invaded the new democratic cultural and educational departments should be further eliminated.

### 从开封文教界思想情况看《武训传》讨论的重要性

　　从开封文教界思想情况看《武训传》讨论的重要性
    本报特约记者　刘国明
    电影《武训传》上集是五月二日开始在开封上演的，一共演了十一场，估计至少有一万五千人看过它。那时河南省初等教育会议正在开封举行，省文教厅还特别请各专区、市、县一百多个代表看了一次，开封市师资训练班全体学员也经市文教局批准集体看了一次。另外，“五四”那天有些机关还特别请本单位的青年团员看了一次。那时，《文艺报》上早已发表了批评文章；但这些“观众”在看了影片之后，并未认真进行讨论和批评；省文教厅和市文教局虽然已经知道《武训传》受到了批评，但也并未在组织看《武训传》时候把批评意见加以传达介绍。
    这时，开封市一般人，连不少从事思想教育工作的共产党员在内，对《武训传》的批评是不大关心的；这是思想战线上严重的迟钝和无原则性现象。《武训精神》在开封的影响并不是不严重的。解放之前，一九四七年元月，开封曾正式成立过“河南武训教育协会”，还画了两套大型的“武训画传”长期展览，办了两个武训小学，在报纸上发表过不少文章。直到解放初期，还有人想在一个市立小学门口挂上“武训小学”的招牌。以前“武训教育学会”的主要发起人、理事等，一部已投入新民主主义的教育岗位和其他岗位上工作，其中有些并未改变或并未完全改变对武训的看法。至于“武训精神”对一般知识分子的影响，也还是不能忽视的。
    五月二十日人民日报“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”的社论和党的生活栏“共产党员应当参加关于《武训传》的批判”的号召，引起了中共开封市委和开封文化教育界对这一问题的重视。在中共开封市委指示下，市文教局花了差不多两星期的时间，收集“武训思想”在开封的影响和有关武训的活动的材料，同时布置全市小学教职员学习。六月三日，市文教局长冯纪汉根据所收集的材料，结合具体情况，对全市小学教职员作了一次启发报告；接着就在市文教局学委会统一领导下展开讨论学习。开封市小学教职员共九百多人，其中在解放后新从学校毕业或曾参加过短期学习的不过四分之一，其余都是旧知识分子。学习中因为领导上掌握了启发自由讨论的精神，所以参加学习的人都还能把真实的思想摆出来。在第一周的学习中，根据汇报，绝大多数教职员（约四分之三）对于人民日报社论和批评武训的论点表示不同意或不完全同意。文教局学委会了解到的不同意见有三十六种之多；归纳起来主要有以下几个类型：一、认为武训行乞兴学三十年如一日，虽然买地放账，但他自己并未享受，这种“艰苦精神”、“利他主义”在清末看来，不能算坏，不能认为一无可取。二、武训是贫农出身，一点教育未受过，为兴学受了一生折磨，虽然他所办的学校是为地主服务的教育，但那是他受历史条件的限制，没办法的事，今天不惟不同情他的处境，反而大张旗鼓地向他进攻，未免太残酷、太苛刻。三、武训兴办义学，无论如何总是让农民学到了些文化；今天地主家庭出身的知识分子如果不是在地主家庭帮助下学到了点文化，今天能参加革命工作，对革命尽点贡献么？四、如果说武训因未参加太平军和捻军而受责备，那末今天很多知识分子都是到解放后才参加工作，开封解放前外面有解放区，市内有地下党，但很多知识分子都未参加革命岂不应受更苛刻的责备么！？五、武训行乞兴学虽然客观上发生了维持封建统治的作用，但其主观愿望是好的，是为了劳动人民翻身的，不应对他这种善良愿望一笔抹杀。总括这些人的看法，无非是把主观动机和客观效果对立起来，把一般人没有参加革命斗争和被赞颂为“千古伟大人物”的武训竟反对当时革命斗争的两种情况混淆起来，把教育看成了孤立的。从这种严重的思想混乱情况看来，市文教局布置的学习期限二十天要基本解决问题是不容易的。
    和各小学的讨论同时，开封市各中等学校教职员也在文教工会领导下开始讨论。中共河南省委报告员、省政府主席吴芝圃同志在本月初先后对全省文化工作会议全体代表和开封市中等学校全体教职员及文教机关干部作了两次展开批判《武训传》的报告。但因为领导不够集中有力，所以在中等学校中开展得比较迟缓。
    河南日报在开展《武训传》的批判上，最初火力也不够强。个别同志最初有一种思想，以为批评下面发生工作错误的稿件，如果积压一天，工作就会遭受一天的损失，所以必须早发；而批判《武训传》的稿则晚发一点无妨。这说明了有些人对思想斗争的严重性体会十分不够。河南日报从发表五月二十日人民日报社论和党的生活两文以后，迄今收到关于讨论《武训传》的稿子已有四五十篇。来稿表现的思想可分三种类型：一、完全同意对武训的批判，并联系自己思想进行检查批判的，这是少数；二、表面同意对武训的批判，但思想上并未解决问题的，这类数目较多；三、持反对意见的，只有一篇。在第二类型思想中有以下几种情况：１、在批判武训的时候把岳飞、屈原和武训拉到一起，并且认为他们都是封建统治者的帮凶，这是“左”的一套；２、个别更“左”的意见认为如果不是武训在文化上给满清帮凶，太平天国和捻军就可以胜利；３、以为武训只是一个偶然的变态，因而批评武训也只是当作变态来批评，而不是从整个封建奴化思想上来批评，这可以说是“右”的观点。报纸上的讨论正逐渐展开，读者要求展开讨论的来信也在增加着。
    河南省和开封市文联十二日也召开了一个文艺界的座谈会，讨论在文艺界展开批判《武训传》的问题。省文联决定给各专区文联和市文联发出讨论通知，并介绍开封市的讨论经验；开封市文联和市文教局准备搜集过去开封有关武训的活动的各种资料，开一小规模展览会，以帮助文化教育界深刻认识这个问题。
    从教育界、文艺界及报纸来稿所反映的思想情况看来，展开《武训传》的讨论，肃清反动的“武训精神”的影响，在目前乃是一个十分严重、十分艰巨的斗争。河南省和开封市文联、开封市文教局、河南日报社在组织这一讨论时，最初都想着：因人民日报已发表了不少批评文章，讨论可能形成一面倒，展不开。但事实证明：“武训精神”在资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子或这两个阶级及地主阶级出身的知识分子中，是有一定程度的基础的。这个讨论是可以深入展开，而且必须深入展开的。应该通过这个讨论，把侵入到新民主主义文化教育部门的资产阶级反动思想进一步加以肃清。
