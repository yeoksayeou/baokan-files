　　Marinin Publishes Article Commenting on the Issue of the Treaty of Peace with Japan
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: *Pravda* commentator Marinin said: Concluding a peace treaty with Japan is an important international issue after the war. Experience shows that, just as the existence of militarist Germany in the center of Europe inevitably led to a world war, the existence of militarist Japan in Asia has every possibility of causing the same result. The peace treaty with Japan should naturally take these historical lessons into consideration, eliminate the possibility of the resurgence of Japanese militarism, and ensure that Japan becomes a peace-loving and democratic country. However, the purpose of the US draft peace treaty with Japan is completely contrary to this. The US ruling clique has violated the Potsdam Agreement and wants to conclude a separate treaty in order to create the necessary conditions for the US to completely dominate Japan. The US has opened the way for the resurgence of Japanese militarism and the restoration of Japan's war economic potential, which proves that the US ruling clique, under the guise of the peace treaty with Japan, is preparing for another war in Asia.

　　Therefore, they invaded Korea, ignored the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, seized Taiwan, and stubbornly refused to return Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China in the draft peace treaty with Japan, in accordance with the provisions of the 1943 Cairo Declaration.

　　Marinin concluded: The Soviet government's proposal for a peace treaty with Japan guarantees that the preparation of the treaty should be based on international cooperation and stipulates that Japan should be transformed into a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country. This peace treaty proposal is in line with the vital interests of all the people of Asia—including the Japanese people. All true friends of peace value the Soviet government's opinions on the US government's draft peace treaty with Japan, considering it a clear and effective solution to the Japanese problem in the interests of peace and security.

    保证日本成为民主国家     
　  马里宁著文评论对日媾和问题
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：真理报评论员马里宁说：对日媾和是战后的重要国际问题。经验表明，正如军国主义的德国在欧洲中心的存在必不可免要引起世界大战一样，军国主义的日本在亚洲的存在，也有引起同样结果的充分可能。对日媾和自然应该考虑这些历史的教训，要排除日本军国主义再起的可能性，保证日本变为爱好和平的民主国家。然而美国对日和约草案的目的完全与这相反。美国统治集团竟然违犯波茨坦协定，想订立单独和约以便创造美国完全统治日本的必要条件。美国打开了使日本军国主义再起和使日本战争经济潜力恢复的道路，这证明美国统治集团在对日媾和的伪装之下，是准备在亚洲进行另一次战争。
    因此他们侵略朝鲜，忽视中华人民共和国在准备对日和约上的合法权利，夺取台湾，在对日和约草案中顽固地不愿根据一九四三年开罗宣言的规定将台湾与澎湖列岛归还中国。
    马里宁在结语中说：苏联政府所提出的对日媾和的方案，保证和约的准备应根据国际合作，并规定把日本变为爱好和平的民主独立国家。这种和约方案符合亚洲全体人民——包括日本人民在内——的切身利益。凡是和平的一切真正友人，都重视苏联政府对于美国政府所起草的对日和约草案的意见，认为这是为了和平与安全的利益而正当地解决日本问题的明白而有效的方案。
