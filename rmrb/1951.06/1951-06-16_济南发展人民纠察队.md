Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: The mass-based public security organization in Jinan, the People's Militia, has played a significant role in assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. According to statistics from three public security sub-bureaus in the city, the People's Militia has reported and assisted in the capture of over 120 counter-revolutionary elements. Da Ming Lake Militia members, while patrolling at night, captured the special agent Zhang Jintang, who was attempting to escape under the cover of darkness. Song Danniang from the New Market, along with male members, uncovered and arrested the hidden local tyrant and landlord, Wang Xingming.

The Jinan People's Militia was developed during last winter's defense campaign. They have played a significant role in this movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, earning the warm love and support of the people. Many new activists who emerged during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries have now joined the militia. In the past month, the People's Militia has grown from 11,000 to 14,700 members. When recruiting members, the team adopts a method of member introductions, squad and team meetings for review, and approval from the local police station to ensure the purity of the militia.

People's Militia members do not leave their production posts. Under the direct leadership of the public security police station, they hold regular meetings, listen to reports, organize learning sessions, and conduct discipline inspections to continuously improve their ideological level. They have also adopted patriotic pledges, urging each other to adhere to them. The People's Militia has now become a capable assistant to the Jinan public security organs in maintaining social order.

　　济南发展人民纠察队
    【新华社济南十三日电】济南市群众性的治安保卫组织——人民纠察队，在协助政府镇压反革命的工作上发挥了很大作用。据该市三个公安分局的统计，由人民纠察队检举和协助捕捉的反革命分子就有一百二十余名。大明湖纠察队员在夜间巡逻时，捕获了乘夜潜逃的特务分子张金堂。新市场的宋大娘和男队员一起侦悉和逮捕了隐匿的恶霸地主王兴明。
    济南市人民纠察队是去年冬防期间发展起来的。他们在这次镇压反革命运动中发挥了很大作用，受到人民群众的热烈爱戴，在镇压反革命运动中所涌现出来的许多新的积极分子，现在大都参加了纠察队。在过去一个月中，人民纠察队已由一万一千人发展到一万四千七百人。该队吸收队员时，采取队员介绍，中队、小队开会审查和派出所批准的方法，保证了纠察队的纯洁性。
    人民纠察队队员是不脱离生产的，他们在公安派出所的直接领导下，举行定期的会议，经常听报告，组织学习和检查纪律，不断地提高自己的思想水平。他们还订了爱国公约，互相督促执行。人民纠察队现已成为济南市公安机关维护社会治安的得力助手。
