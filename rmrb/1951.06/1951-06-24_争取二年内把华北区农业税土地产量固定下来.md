Strive to Fix Agricultural Tax Land Yields in North China Within Two Years

“Correctly implement the agricultural tax policy of assessing taxes according to rates, democratic appraisal, and fixed burden. Utilize slack seasons to carry out appraisal and quantity determination in a planned and focused manner, and strive to fully achieve fixed burden within the next two years.” – Instructions from the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government on several major tasks for the North China Region in 1951, March 22, 1951.

Why Fix Agricultural Tax Land Yields?

Why fix agricultural tax land yields? First, fixed yield is the foundation for correctly implementing the policy of assessing taxes according to rates and implementing a reasonable burden, and it is a prerequisite for achieving a fixed burden. Second, it enables farmers to calculate the amount of public grain they should pay according to the quantity and quality of their cultivated land, allowing them to freely engage in production and strive for agricultural abundance. Third, it can gradually transform the agricultural tax collection work from a task-oriented central task into a regular task. Currently, because land yields are not fixed, the Party, government, and people all work together, spending two months on the summer tax and three months on the autumn tax, and the work is still quite intense. In the future, after land yields are fixed, only one month will be needed for the summer tax and two months for the autumn tax. This will free up more time for the government to lead production. Fourth, after the census of the agricultural population, land, and yield, relatively complete and accurate basic figures can be prepared for the future formulation of agricultural production plans. At that time, the main task of the business departments will be to assess taxes according to rates based on the agricultural tax regulations, strengthen investigation and research, improve collection operations, and adjust collection types, so that agricultural tax can better serve production, serve farmers, and serve to enrich national financial resources.

How Can Land Yields Be Fixed?

I. Standard: Land is clearly surveyed, yields are accurately determined, registers are well-made, and they comply with the "Regulations on Standards for Determining Agricultural Tax Land Area and Normal Annual Yield" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government.

II. Method: Different guidelines and requirements should be put forward according to different regions. In areas where land yields have been repeatedly surveyed and appraised and are generally accurate, a general review and sampling inspection and individual adjustments should be carried out to strive to do it well in one go and fix it; it is essential to avoid disrupting the original foundation and starting from scratch. In areas where there is a production determination foundation, but it is not sufficiently accurate and balanced, the land grade should first be appropriately adjusted on the original basis. The proportion of originally low yields should be increased, and the proportion of originally high yields should be reduced, striving for universal accuracy and balanced burden. In areas with no production determination foundation or a very weak production determination foundation: Some of these areas have only recently undergone land reform and have not yet issued land ownership certificates. The number of land mu should first be investigated in conjunction with the work of issuing land ownership certificates, and then grades should be divided and yields determined through investigation. Land grades should be divided by the masses by village and compared among villages. In terms of yield determination, the method of combining "top-down" investigation and yield determination with "bottom-up" mass appraisal should be adopted. It is necessary to overcome the empiricism and tailism of purely bottom-up "democratic appraisal", and also to prevent the subjectivism of purely top-down approaches that do not proceed from reality. The key lies in conducting in-depth investigations, strengthening leadership, holding good people's congresses and farmer's congresses, following the mass line, and turning the balancing of burdens into the farmers' own business.

III. Leadership: Ideologically, on the one hand, we must oppose "being too low" based on departmentalism, and on the other hand, we must prevent "being too high" based on a purely fiscal viewpoint. In terms of organizational leadership, it should be carried out step by step and in an organized manner, instead of "taking one step and feeling our way, picking up one and dropping another." Overcome the work style of "blindly blossoming" and "single-handedness." Leading cadres should grasp the basic links of the work, discover problems, create experience, and promote progress from point to surface in a wave-like manner.

　　争取二年内把华北区农业税土地产量固定下来
    “正确执行依率计征、民主评定、固定负担的农业税收政策，利用农闲有步骤有重点地进行评产订量，争取今后二年内完全做到固定负担。”——一九五一年三月二十二日中央人民政府华北事务部关于华北区一九五一年几项主要工作任务的指示。
  为什么要固定农业税的土地产量？
    为什么要固定农业税的土地产量呢？第一、固定产量是正确执行依率计征、贯彻合理负担政策的基础，是做到固定负担的先决条件。第二、它使农民有可能按照自己的耕地的量与质计算应缴公粮的数目，放手进行生产，争取农业的丰产。第三、它能使农业税的征收工作逐渐由突击性的中心任务变成经常性的工作。目前因为土地产量没有固定，每逢征收时，党、行政、人民一齐动手，夏征二个月，秋征三个月，工作还是相当紧张的。将来土地产量固定后，夏征只需一个月、秋征只需二个月就够了。这样政府便可腾出更多的时间来领导生产。第四、经过农业人口、土地、产量的普查工作，可以给今后制定农业生产计划准备好比较完整精确的基础数字。那时业务部门的主要工作，将是根据农业税条例依率计征，加强调查研究，改进征收业务，调整征收种类，使农业税更好地为生产服务，为农民服务，为充实国家财力服务。
  怎样才能固定土地产量？
    一、标准：土地查清，产量定实，册籍造好，符合中央人民政府财政部颁布的《关于农业税土地面积及常年应产量订定标准的规定》。
    二、方法：要根据不同地区，提出不同的方针和要求。土地产量迭经勘评，已大体真实的地区，应普审抽查、个别调整，力求一次做好，予以固定；切忌打乱原有基础，从头做起。虽有订产基础，但不够真实平衡的地区，应在原有基础上，首先把土地等级调整适当。原订产量较低的比例提高，原订产量较高的比例降低，力求普遍真实和负担平衡。无订产基础或订产基础很弱的地区：其中部分地区土地改革不久，尚未颁发土地证，应首先结合发土地证工作，清查土地亩数，然后划分等级，调查定产。土地等级，应由群众分村划定，联村比齐。定产上，要采取“自上而下”的调查定产与“自下而上”的群众评议相结合的方法，要克服单纯自下而上“民主评议”的经验主义和尾巴主义做法，也要防止不从实际出发，单纯自上而下的主观主义做法。其关键在于深入调查，加强领导，开好人代会和农代会，走群众路线，把平衡负担变成农民自己的事。
    三、领导：在思想上，一方面要反对从本位主义出发的“偏低”，一方面也要防止从单纯财政观点出发的“偏高”。组织领导方面，要有步骤有组织地进行，不要“走一步摸一步，拿起一个又丢下一个”。克服“盲目开花”和“单打一”的工作作风。领导干部要掌握工作的基本环节，发现问题，创造经验，由点到面地波浪推进。
