For Whom Did Wu Xun Really Serve?
    Bao Chang

    The criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and the study of the People's Daily editorial and other documents related to "The Life of Wu Xun," have been unfolding across the country. This study movement is extremely important. It has already significantly improved the ideological understanding of a large portion of the people and clarified many issues.

    However, we still see some people who, intentionally or unintentionally, continue to defend Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun." They still harbor many internal resistances and doubts about the basic viewpoints pointed out in the People's Daily editorial.

    First, some people are still attempting to fundamentally deny objective historical facts. They believe that Wu Xun was always on the side of the working people, a "good person" who "established schools" for the "poor and needy." They do not know that Wu Xun, from the age of twenty, politically sided with the thoroughly reactionary ruling class who cruelly suppressed peasant revolutions. At that time, not only was the entire country in a period of high peasant revolutionary struggle, but in and around Wu Xun's hometown (Jinxiang, Yuncheng, Linqing, Gaotang, Heze, Dingtao) there was constant fighting by the Taiping Army and the Nian Army, a fierce battlefield of revolution and counter-revolution.

    What benefits did such "school establishment" bring to the working people? Let's imagine: a vagrant who degenerated from the peasantry, relying on the political and economic support of the ruling class, saying to the rulers: "Build a free school!" (To embellish this war-torn era!) Saying to the people, "Let the children come to school!" (To be good citizens, to find a way out as slaves!) What revolutionary significance can be found in such a face?

    From the practical effects of Wu Xun's school establishment, one can also see: for whom did Wu Xun build the free schools? Wu Xun built three free schools. The teachers he hired were: Cui Zhun, a licentiate from Shou Zhang; Gu Zhong'an, a Jinshi degree holder from Liaocheng; Cao Lianzhi, a licentiate from Boping; Jia Pinzhong, a licentiate from Qinghe, and others. At that time, in the Liulin Yishu (free school), "in each annual county exam, the number of students entering the academy and receiving stipends was no less than one or two dozen" (Liu Zizhou: "Biography of Righteous Scholar Wu Gong"). Wu Xun's disciple, Sha Mingyuan, also mentioned in his "Record of the Beginning and End of Wu Xun's School Establishment" that "the tuition must be generous, the school rules must be strict, the etiquette for entering the school must be loyal and respectful... therefore, the number of those who achieved high scores and received stipends in the school was more than a dozen." Look! What kind of teachers and students were these? Is it not clear? Where is the "building of free schools for the poor and needy"? Li Boju, who knew Wu Xun, said in "Record of Wu Xun's Ancestral Hall": "When the Liulin free school was completed, famous teachers were hired, and elders and gentry from all directions were invited to manage the school affairs, so those who carried books and boxes came from hundreds of miles away." Here, we can also see that those who traveled hundreds of miles to attend school were of course only the children of wealthy gentry, and not the children of the working people. Precisely because of this, after Wu Xun's free school was built, even the management rights were completely handed over to the landlord class. All of this is an objective historical fact: Wu Xun built "free schools" for the ruling class, which is beyond doubt.

    In addition to the many confused ideas lingering around the "school establishment" issue, Wu Xun's defenders are also waving another banner: "altruism." They believe that Wu Xun worked hard all his life, ultimately "not for himself" but for "others." They believe that Wu Xun's proclaimed "altruism" was also a "struggle" against the ruling class's "egoism," and therefore Wu Xun was still a "revolutionary," and so on. This kind of argument is also very absurd. Wu Xun's "altruism" benefited the reactionary ruling class. Wu Xun called on the ruling class to be "altruistic," which was actually calling on the ruling class to give small favors to achieve great schemes, in order to disintegrate the people's revolution and consolidate feudal rule. Wu Xun called on the working people to be "altruistic," which was actually calling on the working people to forget themselves and their lives for the rulers, to swallow their anger and bear their grievances. Ultimately, who benefited from this "altruism"? The Qing Emperor put it well. After hearing about Wu Xun's deeds, he said: "Excellent! With such a righteous man, we can encourage customs and cultivate talents. Let him establish a dedicated ancestral hall without delay!" (Quoted from "Record of Wu Xun's Ancestral Hall"). The Qing Emperor was not necessarily a fool. If Wu Xun had cultivated only talents like Hong Xiuquan, he would never have been given memorial archways, dedicated ancestral halls, or biographies in the National History Museum. The actual content of Wu Xun's "altruism" was merely to "encourage customs and cultivate talents" for the emperor. Is this kind of "altruism" something that we should promote?

    In fact, Wu Xun himself admitted long ago that he established free schools for "fame," "doing good," and "so that his descendants could ride in sedan chairs carried by eight men." From the age of fifty-three, "until he lived in Linqing at the home of Shi Junshan, a customs official, he successively held positions as prefect and school inspector." (Chen Enpu: "Wu Xun's School Establishment Stele Inscription"). This is a process of Wu Xun gradually "acquiring a position to promote feudal culture that he did not originally have." Everyone, take a look! Was Wu Xun's motivation for establishing schools "pure"? If he really "forgot himself for others," he should have joined the peasant revolutionary ranks long ago and become an anonymous hero, shedding blood and sacrificing his life without regret. But Wu Xun took the opposite path. People do not promote the selflessness of countless revolutionary peasants who shed blood and sacrificed their lives, but insist on promoting a Wu Xun that even the promoters themselves do not fully understand and cannot emulate. Isn't this something that should give us pause for thought?

    Wu Xun's defenders believe that Wu Xun's "asceticism" ultimately set an example of "diligence and hardship" for the working people; it was ultimately a "weapon" that moved the ruling class at the time; to put it more nicely, Wu Xun's "asceticism," compared to the ruling class's debauchery, still had a lot of "positive" significance!

    I think this kind of view is also absurd. In essence, what Wu Xun did was not asceticism but ugly and evil behavior, as the People's Daily editorial said: this was "exhausting all means of servility to the reactionary feudal rulers," an "ugly behavior." It could only create a typical image of a slave in front of the ruling class, only consolidate the ruling class's political and spiritual victory, only increase the ruling class's political capital for conducting reactionary propaganda, and could not show the working people any example. Think about it, what can we learn from Wu Xun? Is kneeling to landlords something we can learn? Is eating snakes, scorpions, feces, and urine something we can learn? Is begging for food without working something we can learn? Is using begging as a cover for lending money and collecting rent something we can actually learn? What exactly are the people who promote Wu Xun planning to emulate from him?

    Wu Xun's character was base. In order to "win the favor of his employers, he would wear blindfolds like oxen and horses when grinding grain, imitating the sounds of oxen and horses, and grind grain very excitedly." (Wang Lianquan: "The Spirit of Mr. Wu Xun"). Only the feudal ruling class believed that "his ambition and character stood above all things" (Yuan Shuxun: "Memorial Requesting the Recording of Righteous Beggar Wu Xun's Accumulation of Funds to Establish Schools in the National History Museum"). But Wu Xun's followers insist on finding virtues of "asceticism" and "perseverance" in this beggar who was servile to the bone. We know that Chiang Kai-shek also praised Wu Xun: "Unprecedented in his actions, benevolent and harmonious, truly worthy of being called firm and resolute..." and so on. Why do our Wu Xun followers echo Chiang Kai-shek without realizing it?

    When the criticism of Wu Xun has already become an undeniable fact, we still hear a kind of skeptical argument. They believe that: "Wu Xun cannot play a pivotal role at a moment like Lu Bu in 'Shooting the Halberd at the Gate,' so I think Wu Xun is being praised too highly... He is not worth our eulogizing, nor should he be criticized as worthless." (Anonymous) Or: "Those fictional and unreasonable stories in the movie 'The Life of Wu Xun' do indeed slander the Chinese peasant revolution, slander the Chinese nation, and slander Chinese history. Mr. Tao would never have thought of these things when he was alive... This responsibility lies with the film, and cannot be attributed to Mr. Tao." (Note: that is, it cannot be attributed to Wu Xun, whom Mr. Tao admired) (Li Shizhao). In short, the doubts of these people lie in: was Wu Xun himself really as bad as we say? Are the historical materials we cited to criticize Wu Xun reliable? Is the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" "excessive"?

    It is completely clear that the skepticism of the Wu Xun criticism is essentially an attempt to refuse to criticize Wu Xun and blame others.

    Our criticism must be based on reliable historical materials. The existing criticisms are all based on accurate historical facts. Those who thoroughly supported Wu Xun are the very people who recorded these historical materials. Didn't these people preserve the "Thirty-Five Songs of Wu Xun's School Establishment"? Is there any doubt about these materials?

    Who elevated Wu Xun? The people? No! The people at that time simply did not pay attention to this "bean curd dregs." Just as "bean curd dregs" did not pay attention to the people. On the contrary, it was the feudal reactionary ruling class that elevated Wu Xun. It was Guo Chunxu, Zhuang Honglie (the county magistrates at the time), Zhang Yao, Yuan Shuxun (the governor at the time), Guangxu, Cixi, Liang Qichao, Zhang Jian, and Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and others. Look at Shandong Governor Zhang Yao's memorial: "I respectfully request Your Majesty's grace to approve the commoner Wu Qi of Tangyi County to build a memorial archway at his own expense, and grant the words 'Happy to Do Good Deeds' to show commendation." Later, Yuan Shuxun said: "Merely granting ordinary commendation, I am afraid that his hard work and extraordinary deeds will not be sufficient to show to future generations." He also requested that he be recorded in the National History Museum and that he be admitted to the Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Brotherhood Shrine. After the Republic of China, President Xu Shichang gave him a plaque of "Enthusiastic About Public Welfare," and Shandong's executioner of the people, Han Fuqu, gave him a plaque of "Lasting Educational Influence." The traitor Wang Jingwei inscribed "Uprightness to the Weak and Cowardly," and the Kuomintang reactionaries, led by Chiang Kai-shek, had "Praise for Mr. Wu Xun," praising him to the highest degree. That is how Wu Xun became famous. Wu Xun certainly did not have a will to "regard fish eyes as jewels" when he died (anonymous words), but it is definitely an undeniable fact that this "jewel" Wu Xun was carved out by the ruling class.

    Some people also feel wronged for Wu Xun. They believe that "Wu Xun was neither a descendant of an official nor a member of the literati," only the reactionaries praised him as a "teacher of ten thousand people," only "the film portrayed him as so lofty and great" (anonymous), so he is now being scolded so much, isn't that unjust? Some even believe that "This, it cannot be said is not a great tragedy that went against expectations!... If we demand Wu Xun, who grew up in a typical feudal rural area, to make a trans-historical leap, it seems to be too high or too harsh." (Dong Lu). This means that Wu Xun was made into a criminal, purely the fault of the ruling class, Wu Xun himself should not be responsible, and we are now so strictly demanding Wu Xun, Wu Xun is too unlucky.

    In fact, shouldn't Wu Xun be responsible for his own behavior? Isn't it true that Wu Xun voluntarily left labor, left the working people, exploited the working people with high interest rates, accumulated fields up to nine hundred mu, and completely sided with the reactionary landlords, colluding with the reactionary landlords and praising each other, all because he consciously believed that this was in his interest? And the most important reason why Wu Xun and the "Spirit of Wu Xun" were so highly praised by the ruling class and had a significant impact on society was not because Wu Xun's behavior conformed to the interests of the ruling class? If Wu Xun had really firmly stood on the side of the working people, he would have been scolded by Zeng Guofan as a "rebellious dog" of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom long ago.

    It can be seen from this that our strict criticism of Wu Xun today is by no means "a trans-historical leap." Lenin said: "To estimate the objective content of history in specific concrete circumstances, in the specified concrete environment, to first understand which class movement is the main driving force of the possible process in this concrete environment." We are criticizing Wu Xun precisely on this principle. We say that Wu Xun not only did not promote the development of revolutionary history at that time, but hindered it. Since some people have greatly praised him by reversing right and wrong, we must greatly criticize him to clarify merits and demerits. Is there anything biased about this?

    All skeptics of the Wu Xun criticism, today is precisely the time to boldly doubt and criticize their own thoughts, in order to improve their ideological level.

    Currently, in the nationwide study of "The Life of Wu Xun," it can be clearly seen what a chaotic situation exists on our ideological front. I believe that the main ideological obstacles to criticizing Wu Xun and the "Spirit of Wu Xun" are:

    The first and most important is the problem of bourgeois reformism in politics. We know that the promotion and praise of Wu Xun was mainly the result of the reactionary ruling class's propaganda, but a large part of it was also due to the mischief of the bourgeois reactionary reformism.

    Bourgeois reformers believe that people can turn over without political struggle, without armed struggle. Therefore, they promote Wu Xun's school movement, believing that it is a kind of cultural revolution that can improve the people's living status and cultural status. In fact, the essence of this theory is to ask the people to avoid talking about the fundamental issues of revolution (the issue of political power) and surrender to the ruling class. In addition, reformers also believe that some political freedom and improvement in the lives of the masses can be obtained from the ruling class through peaceful compromise, and that the rulers can make some concessions. They are even able to peacefully coexist with counter-revolutionary enemies. They are afraid of serious revolutionary battles, afraid of bloody armed struggle. But in essence, they are afraid of the people's revolutionary mass movement.

    Lenin once said: "The bourgeoisie fears mass movements more than it fears reactionary forces. Therefore, the liberals show a kind of astonishing, simply incredible weakness in politics." Chairman Mao also had this analysis of the Chinese national bourgeoisie: "Due to their economic and political weakness, and due to the fact that they have not completely severed economic ties with imperialism and feudal remnants, they do not have the courage to thoroughly oppose imperialism and feudalism. This situation is most obvious when the revolutionary forces of the masses become strong." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party").

    Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why some bourgeoisie and their intellectuals are so enthusiastic about worshiping Wu Xun, but are not so interested in the "joining forces on the mountain" figures in Chinese revolutionary history. They enthusiastically promote Wu Xun, while at the same time trying to despise, forget, bury, or even slander our tradition of people's revolutionary wars in history. In short, from today's critical process of "The Life of Wu Xun," we have indeed found that this reactionary reformist thought still has a considerable influence. Therefore, it must be thoroughly criticized.

    The second is the tendency of petty-bourgeois intellectuals to detach themselves from revolutionary struggle and from the masses of the people.

    Chairman Mao said: "Before intellectuals are integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the masses, before they are determined to serve the interests of the masses and popularize their lives, their thoughts are often empty and their actions are often vacillating." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party"). And many of our intellectuals came from the old society, and ideologically still retain various connections with imperialism, feudalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. All these ideological connections have not been thoroughly criticized and cleared. They have also been entrenched in cultural positions for a long time, and some have even put on the cloak of "Marxism-Leninism" and "serving the people," talking emptily about revolution. However, when they encounter concrete revolutionary practice, it is easy to reveal that what they yearn for is not the revolution of the masses of the people, but a Wu Xun-style "revolution."

    Lenin said: "Revolutionary phrases are repetitions of revolutionary slogans, without considering the objective situation, ignoring the current flaws of events, ignoring the current state of affairs. The slogans are beautiful, tempting, and intoxicating... but there is no place for them to stand - this is the essence of revolutionary phrases." ("On Revolutionary Phrases"). We can't say nice things anymore, now we must honestly, humbly, and seriously criticize ourselves and transform ourselves. As Chairman Mao called on us: "We must go to the masses, we must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the fiery struggle, to the only widest and richest source, unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and for a long time." This is the only path we should take today, and it is also the inevitable conclusion we should draw from studying "The Life of Wu Xun."

### 武训到底是为谁服务的？

　　武训到底是为谁服务的？
    鲍昌
    关于电影《武训传》的批判，以及对人民日报社论等有关《武训传》文件的学习，已经在全国各地展开了。这个学习运动十分重要。它已经使极大的一部分人从思想上提高了不少认识，明确了不少问题。
    但是，我们仍然看到这样一些人，这些人仍有意无意地继续在那里为武训及《武训传》辩护着。他们对人民日报社论中所指出的基本论点，仍存在着许多内心的抵触与怀疑。
    首先，就是有些人仍然企图从根本上否认客观历史事实。他们认为武训自始至终是站在劳动人民的立场上，为了“贫寒”而“兴学”的“好人”。他们不知道，武训从二十岁起就在政治上投靠凶恶地镇压农民革命的彻底反动的统治阶级了。当时不但全国正处在农民革命斗争的高涨时期，而且就在武训故乡及其周围（金乡、郓城、临清、高唐、菏泽、定陶）就有太平军及捻军的不断斗争，就是革命与反革命的激烈的战场。
    这样的“兴学”对劳动人民有何利益呢？让我们设想一下：一个从农民中蜕化出来的游民，依靠着统治阶级政治上经济上的各种支持，向统治者说：“修个义学吧！”（点缀点缀这个兵荒马乱的年代！）向人民说“让孩子们上学来吧！”（做个顺民，当个奴隶去找出路！）这样一副嘴脸，有何革命意义可言呢？
    从武训兴学的实践效果上也可以看到：武训到底是为谁修了义学的？武训修了三处义学，请的老师是：寿张举人崔准、聊城进士顾仲安、博平举人曹连枝、清河举人贾品重等人。当时在柳林义塾中，“每科岁考，学生入泮帮增补廪者，不下一二十人”（刘子舟：《义学正武公传》）。武训弟子沙明远在他的“记武训兴学始末”中也谈到“贽金必丰，塾规必严，入塾礼节必忠必敬……故塾中掇巍科、食廪饩者十数人”。看！这是什么样的老师，什么样的学生，难道还不明白吗？那里有什么“修个义学为贫寒”的事呢？和武训相识的李伯骥在“武训先生祠堂记”中说：“而柳林之义学成，历聘名师，延四方绅耆管理学务，于是负笈担簦而来者，不远百余里”。这里还可看到：不远百里负笈而来者，当然只有一些富绅子弟，而不会有劳动人民的子弟了。正因为这样，所以武训的义学修成之后，连管理权也是完全交给地主阶级的。凡此一切，都是客观的历史事实——武训是为统治阶级修了“义学”，这是无可怀疑的。
    除了在“兴学”问题上纠缠着不少的糊涂观念外，武训辩护者还打着另外的一个旗号——“利他主义”。认为武训辛苦了一生，究竟“不是为了自己”而是为了“别人”。认为武训所标榜的“利他主义”，也是对统治阶级“利己主义”的一个“斗争”，因而武训仍是“革命者”云云。这种议论也是很荒谬的。武训的“利他”者，利反动统治阶级之谓也。武训号召统治阶级“利他”，其实就是号召统治阶级施小惠以成大谋，借以瓦解人民革命、巩固封建统治。武训号召劳动人民“利他”，其实就是号召劳动人民对于统治者舍己忘生、吞声饮恨。究竟这种“利他主义”给谁带来了好处？清朝皇帝说的好，他在听到武训事迹以后说：“都哉！有此义人，可以激励风化，培养人材。尚其建立专祠，毋其缓！”（引自“武训先生祠堂记”）。清朝皇帝未必是傻子，武训如果培养出净是像洪秀全那样的人材来，绝不会给他立碑坊、建专祠、付国史馆立传。而武训“利他主义”的实际内容不过是为皇帝“激励风化、培养人材”而已。难道这种“利他主义”是应当由我们来加以宣扬的吗？
    其实武训自己早就供认了，他原是为了“有名”“行好”“子孙坐八抬大轿”而修义学的。他自己从五十三岁起“至临清寓于钞关街施君善政家时，历任州牧及学正”。（陈恩普：“武训先生兴学碑文”）这就是武训逐步“取得自己所没有的宣传封建文化的地位”的一个过程。大家看看！武训兴学的动机是“纯洁”的吗？如果他真的“忘我为人”的话，他早就应当投身于农民革命队伍中，做一个无名英雄，虽流血牺牲，死而无怨。但武训却走了相反的道路。人们不去宣传无数革命农民流血牺牲的忘我为人，却偏要去宣传一个连宣传者自己也不甚了了并且也不能效法的武训，这不是很可令人深长思之吗？
    武训辩护者认为：武训的“苦行”究竟是为劳动人民立下一个“勤苦”的榜样；究竟是在当时感动了统治阶级的一个“武器”；说的再好听些：武训的“苦行”和统治阶级的荒淫无耻比拟起来，还存在着不少的“积极”意义哩！
    我认为这类看法也是荒谬的。从本质上看，武训所做的并不是苦行而是丑行恶行，正如人民日报社论所说：这是“对反动的封建统治者竭尽奴颜婢膝的能事”的一种“丑恶的行为”。它只能在统治阶级面前，创造出一个典型的奴婢形象来，只能巩固统治阶级在政治上、精神上的胜利，只能增加统治阶级进行反动宣传的政治资本，而不能示劳动人民以任何榜样。想想看，武训究竟有什么可以取法呢？向地主下跪可以取法吗？吃蛇蝎屎尿可以取法吗？不劳动而讨吃可以取法吗？讨吃其名而放债收租其实可以取法吗？宣传武训的人们，究竟准备取法他的那一条呢？
    武训的性格是卑贱的。为了“博得雇主的欢心，在推磨时和牛马似的戴上蒙眼，学着牛马的鸣声，很兴奋的推磨”。（汪濂泉：《武训先生的精神》）只有封建统治阶级才认为“其志量品格卓立乎万物之表”（袁树勋：“奏义丐武训积资兴学请宣付史馆立传”）。而武训的信徒却一定要从这个奴颜婢骨的叫花子身上找出“苦行”“坚毅”的美德来。我们知道，蒋介石也歌颂过武训：“独行空前，仁乐义协，允无愧于坚苦卓绝……”云云。为什么我们的武训信徒竟与蒋介石应声而和，且不知觉悟呢？
    当人们对武训的批判已经铁案如山的时候，我们还听到一种怀疑派的论调。他们认为：“武训不能像‘辕门射戟’的吕奉先可以在一时起举足轻重的作用，所以我认为把武训捧的过高……他不值得我们歌颂，也不该评的一文不值。”（弃名）或者说：“电影《武训传》上那些虚构的不合情理的故事，确是污蔑了中国的农民革命，污蔑了中国民族和中国历史，这些在陶先生生前是绝没有想到的……这个责任在电影，而不能归之于陶先生。”（按：即不能归之于陶先生崇拜的武训）（李士钊）。总之，这些人的怀疑点在于：武训本人是否就是我们所说的那么坏？我们所引证的批判武训的史料是否可靠？“武训传”的讨论是不是“过份”？
    完全可以看清楚：武训批判的怀疑论，在实质上就是想拒绝批判武训并嫁罪于人。
    我们的批判必须征诸于可靠的史料。已有的批判都是根据确切的历史事实。纪录这些历史材料的正是那些彻底拥护武训的人，难道“武训兴学歌三十五首”不是这些人保留下来的吗？难道这些材料还有什么疑问吗？
    武训是谁捧起来的？是人民么？不是！人民在当时根本就没有把这个“豆沫”放在眼里。如同“豆沫”也不把人民看在眼里一样。相反地，把武训捧起来的正是封建的反动的统治阶级。正是郭春煦、庄洪烈（当时的县官）、张曜、袁树勋（当时的巡抚）、光绪、慈禧、梁启超、张謇以及蒋介石、汪精卫这些人。请看山东巡抚张曜在奏片中说：“仰恳天恩俯准堂邑县民武七，自行建坊，给与‘乐善好施’字样，以示旌奖。”而后任的袁树勋就说：“仅予寻常旌表，诚恐苦操奇行，不足以示来兹。”又要求宣付史馆立传、进忠义孝弟祠。到了民国以后，徐世昌“大总统”给他“热心公益”的匾额，山东人民刽子手韩复榘给以“教泽长存”的匾额。汉奸汪精卫题给他“廉顽立懦”，国民党反动派头子蒋介石则有“武训先生传赞”，推崇备至，而武训就是这样出了名了。武训临死时，确实没有“把鱼的眼睛当珠宝看待”（弃名语）的遗嘱，但武训这块“珠宝”是统治阶级雕琢出来的，却是肯定无疑的事实。
    有人还替武训抱冤屈。认为“武训既不是宦门后代，也不是士大夫之流”，只是反动派才把他捧为“万人师表”的，只是“电影把他描写的那么崇高伟大”（弃名），结果今天挨了这么大的骂，岂不冤哉？甚至认为“这，不能不说是一个事与愿违的大悲剧！……假如我们要求生长在典型封建农村里的武训，来一个超历史的跳跃，似乎是过高或过苛的。”（董鲁）这意思就是说：武训被造成一个罪人，纯粹是统治阶级的罪过，武训自己是不应当负责的，而我们今天这样严格要求武训，武训太倒霉了。
    实际上，武训不应当对自己的行为负责么？难道武训脱离劳动，脱离劳动人民，以高利重租盘剥劳动人民，积田至九百亩，并完全投靠反动地主，与反动地主同流合污，互相标榜，这一切不是甘心情愿的么？不是因为他自觉这是他的利益所在么？而武训及“武训精神”之所以被统治阶级捧得这样高，并对社会起了不少影响，其最主要的原因不是由于武训的行为符合于统治阶级的利益么？如果武训真的坚决站在劳动人民的立场上时，也早就会像太平军一样地被曾国藩骂为天朝“狗逆”了。
    由此可见，我们今天来严格批判武训，绝不是“一个超历史的跳跃”。列宁说：“要在特定的具体情况下，在规定的具体环境中，去估计历史的客观内容，要去先懂得什么阶级的运动乃是这个具体环境中的可能的过程之主要原动力。”我们正是在这个原则上去批判武训的。我们说武训在当时不但没有推动了革命历史的发展，却起了阻碍作用，既有人颠倒是非大大捧场，就必须大大批判以明功过，这难道还有什么偏激吗？
    一切对武训批判上的怀疑论者，今天正是应当大胆地怀疑、批判自己的思想，以便从思想水平上提高一步的时候了。
    目前，在全国各地关于“武训传”的学习中，可以很清楚地看到：我国思想战线上是存在着怎样混乱的情况？我认为，目前在批判武训及“武训精神”时最主要的思想障碍有这样几个：
    第一个并且也是最主要的乃是政治上的资产阶级改良主义问题。我们知道：对于武训的宣扬与歌颂主要的是反动统治阶级传播的结果，但其中也有一大部分是由于资产阶级反动的改良主义的作怪。
    资产阶级改良主义者认为：不要政治斗争，不要武装斗争，人民也可以翻身。因此，他们宣扬武训的兴学运动，认为这也算是一种文化革命，可以改善人民的生活地位，文化地位。其实，这种理论的实质就是要求人民逃避革命的基本问题（政权问题）不谈，向统治阶级缴械投降。另外，改良主义者还认为：通过和平妥协的方法也可以向统治阶级求得某些政治自由、群众生活的改善，得到统治者的某些让步。甚至于可以和反革命敌人和平共居。他们害怕严重的革命战斗，害怕流血的武装斗争。但在实质上是害怕人民革命的群众运动。
    列宁曾说过：“资产阶级害怕群众运动比害怕反动势力还要厉害。因此，自由派在政治上就表现出一种惊人的，简直是不可思议的软弱性。”毛主席对中国民族资产阶级也有过这样的分析：“由于他们在经济上，政治上的软弱性，由于他们同帝国主义与封建残余并未完全断绝经济上的联系，所以，他们又没有彻底反帝反封建的勇气。这种情形，特别在民众革命力量强大起来的时候，表现得最明显。”（“中国革命与中国共产党”）。
    因之，就不难了解：为什么一些资产阶级及其知识分子这样热忱于崇拜武训，而对中国历史上革命战争中“结伙上山”的人物反而没有那么大的兴趣。这样热忱地宣扬武训，而同时却尽量地去轻视、忘记、埋没甚至污蔑我们历史上的人民革命战争传统。总之，从今天“武训传”的批判过程中、我们确实发现了这种反动的改良主义思想还有相当大的影响。因此必须加以彻底的批判。
    其次就是小资产阶级知识分子脱离革命斗争、脱离人民群众的倾向。
    毛主席说：“知识分子在其未与民众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为民众利益服务并使其生活群众化之时，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的”，（《中国革命与中国共产党》）。而我们的许多知识分子出身于旧社会，思想上还和帝国主义、封建主义以及国民党反动派保留着各色各样的联系，所有这些思想上的联系都未曾彻底批判和清贫过。他们又是长期盘踞在文化要津，有的人甚至又穿上“马列主义”、“为人民服务”的外衣，空谈革命。然而，一遇到具体的革命实践，就很容易地暴露出来，他们所向往的原来并不是人民群众的革命，而是武训式的“革命”。
    列宁说过：“革命的词句，是革命口号的重复，而不估计客观的情况，无视事变之现时的破绽，无视现有事物的现状。口号是漂亮的、诱人的、醉心的……却没有其立足的余地——这便是革命词句的实质”（“论革命的词句”）。我们不能再说漂亮话了，现在必须要老老实实地、虚心而认真地批判自己、改造自己。像毛主席所号召我们的：“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热地斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去”。这才是我们今天所应当走的唯一道路，也是我们学习“武训传”所应当得到的必然结论。
