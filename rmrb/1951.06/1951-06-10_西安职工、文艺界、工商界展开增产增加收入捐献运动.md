Xi'an Workers, Literary and Art Circles, and Business Circles
    Launch a Campaign to Increase Production, Increase Income, and Make Donations

    Xi'an City's workers, literary and art circles, and business circles are enthusiastically launching patriotic donation campaigns.

    Workers in Xi'an City are formulating plans to increase production and launch a long-term patriotic donation competition. The repair department of the Xijing Automobile Repair Factory plans to repair 56 cars before July 1st (originally planned for 30); the manufacturing department guarantees to increase production by 30% over the original quota. All employees of the factory have also decided to donate 10% of their bonus income from overproduction each month, until the final victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. All crew members of the rescue train of the Chang'an Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Bureau guarantee no responsibility accidents within three months and will donate one day's wages per month. The Xi'an People's Bank received over 10 million yuan in donations from factory workers in two days. Workers from various factories also organized Yangko teams to conduct costumed propaganda to promote patriotic donations to the citizens.

    Writers, actors, and literary and art groups in Xi'an City are enthusiastically responding to the decision of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to donate "Lu Xun" airplanes. The poet Ke Zhongping donated all 5.5 million yuan of his royalties from the poetry collection "Border Region Self-Defense Army," and the famous Henan Opera actress Chang Xiangyu donated 1 million yuan. Various literary and art groups have formulated donation plans for their respective units. The Northwest Literary and Art Troupe is rushing to stage the famous play "Dragon Beard Ditch," preparing to hold a charity performance around July 1st. The Xiangyu Opera Troupe, Yisu Society, Shangyou Society, Sanyi Society, and Lion Roar Troupe, five folk drama groups, are preparing to stage new plays for charity performances. Other art and music workers have also expressed their intention to hold charity exhibitions and sales in the near future.

    The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce called for donations for "Xi'an Industry and Commerce" airplanes, cannons, and tanks. Xinhua Brick and Tile Company donated 30,000 red standard bricks produced by the company in one day, equivalent to 6.51 million yuan in RMB. Zhou Zhuxuan, the chairman of the Charcoal and Kerosene Trade Association, who is over seventy years old, braved the summer heat and took the lead in holding a donation parade. The industry has now donated 15 million yuan in RMB.
