            A Contrast
    The Soviet Union will have more than 195,000 students graduating from higher education institutions this year, 10,000 more than last year. More than 350,000 new students will be enrolled this year. Many universities are expanding their departments to train experts needed for communist construction projects.
    This is a sharp contrast to the situation in the United States, which is stepping up recruitment of new soldiers and expanding training of cannon fodder for aggressive war.
            Lies Cannot Hide the Truth
    Workers' delegations from various countries who went to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day celebrations, after returning to their countries, gave speeches and published articles in newspapers, detailing everything they saw with their own eyes in the socialist country. They unanimously pointed out how enthusiastically the Soviet people were participating in peaceful construction. When workers in capitalist countries heard what their representatives said, they gained a deeper understanding of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The facts of Soviet peaceful construction cannot be concealed by the slander and lies of the American and British warmongers.
            The Misfortune of British Babies
    The British National Association of Nursery Schools recently held a meeting, and attendees pointed out that the living conditions of British children are deteriorating under the expansion of armaments and war preparations. Military spending continues to increase, while nurseries and infant schools are closing down one after another. The meeting passed a resolution expressing protest. British children and infants are encountering such misfortune because they cannot be used as cannon fodder; otherwise, the belligerent British government would definitely greatly expand nursery schools.
            Despicable Enticement
    The Brazilian delegation to the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, represented by Mr. Berreta, said after returning home from Washington: The United States once stated that if Brazil participated in the Korean War, the United States would provide loans to Brazil. The ways to participate in the war include transporting military food, dispatching troops, and supplying the raw materials needed by American industries and mines.
    The American aggressors, who are being beaten black and blue in Korea, are using such despicable means to coerce and entice various puppet countries to gather cannon fodder for them.

            一个对比
    苏联今年高等教育机关将有十九万五千多名学生毕业，比去年多一万人。今年将招收新生三十五万多人。许多高等学校都在扩大科系以训练共产主义建设工程所需的专家。
    这和美国加紧招募新兵，扩大训练侵略战争所需的炮灰的情形，恰是一个尖锐的对比。
            谎言遮掩不住事实
    曾经到苏联去参加五一节庆典的各国工人代表团，返国后分别在各国国内发表演说和在报纸上发表文章，都详细叙述了他们在社会主义国家所亲眼看见的一切。他们一致指出苏联人民是如何热诚地参加和平建设。资本主义国家的工人们听到他们的代表所说的话，更加深刻地认识了社会主义制度的无比优越。苏联和平建设的事实，不是美英战争贩子们的诬蔑与谎言所能遮掩得住的。
            英国婴儿的厄运
    英国全国托儿所协会最近举行会议，出席的人都指出在扩军备战下英国儿童生活状况日趋恶化。军费不断增加，而托儿所和育婴学校却纷纷停闭。会议通过决议表示抗议。英国儿童和婴孩遭遇这样的厄运，是因为他们不能当炮灰，否则好战的英国政府一定会大大扩充托儿所了。
            卑鄙的利诱
    出席美洲各国外长会议的巴西代表团代表伯雷达从华盛顿回国后说：美国曾经表示，如果巴西参加朝鲜战争，美国将给巴西贷款。参战的方式是运送军粮，派遣军队，并供给美国工矿所需的原料。
    在朝鲜被打得焦头烂额的美国侵略者，就用这样卑鄙的手段，来威逼利诱各仆从国家为它搜罗炮灰的。
