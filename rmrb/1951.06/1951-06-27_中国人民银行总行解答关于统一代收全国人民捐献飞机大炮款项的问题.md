　　People's Bank of China Headquarters Answers Questions Regarding the Unified Collection of National Donations for Airplanes and Cannons
    Question: Why are donations uniformly collected by the People's Bank of China?
    Answer: The People's Bank of China's branches are located in counties and cities throughout the country. After receiving donations, local branches remit them to Beijing on the same day, where the head office aggregates them into the account of the China Resist America Aid Korea General Association. This ensures that dispersed donations from all over the country can be rapidly centralized and used in a timely manner to purchase weapons to meet the needs of the front lines and national defense.
    Question: What attitude and methods should local People's Banks adopt when collecting donations?
    Answer: Local People's Banks should put great effort into organizing this work and should simplify the procedures as much as possible. The people collecting donations should treat donors with a kind attitude. In addition to all externally operating units waiting at counters for donors to make contributions, in larger cities, donors can also notify the local People's Bank by telephone to send someone to collect the donations. If the cadre strength of county People's Banks permits, they should send people to the countryside to collect donations.
    Question: Does the People's Bank of China issue receipts for donations collected?
    Answer: When the People's Bank of China receives a donation, it immediately issues a receipt in triplicate: one copy is given to the donor, one copy is sent by the bank to the local branch of the Resist America Aid Korea Association, and one copy is kept by the bank for its own records. The format of the receipt is uniform nationwide. In addition to listing the donor and the amount, it indicates whether the donor is a worker, farmer, woman, student, or belongs to the industrial and commercial sector, cultural and educational sector, or an organization. It also indicates whether the donation is for the purchase of fighter planes, bombers, tanks, cannons, anti-aircraft guns, or other types of weapons.
    Question: If donations are made in installments or delivered to the People's Bank of China in different locations, what will be used to apply to the Resist America Aid Korea General Association for naming weapons in the future?
    Answer: In the future, applying to the Resist America Aid Korea General Association for naming weapons will be based on the donation receipt issued by the People's Bank of China. For example, whether it is paid in Shanghai or Tianjin, or paid in June or July, as long as the total amount of the collected receipts reaches 1.5 billion yuan, an application can be made to name a fighter plane.
    Question: Is it a good idea to first open a special account under the name of a group, such as "Aircraft No. XX," at the People's Bank of China, and then officially hand over the money after reaching 1.5 billion?
    Answer: This is not necessary, and it is not a good idea. Because future naming can be applied to the Resist America Aid Korea General Association with the donation receipt, if separate special accounts are set up and the money is waited to be collected before handing it over, the money will be kept idle and cannot be used effectively.
    Question: Does the People's Bank of China collect donations of gold, silver, silver dollars, foreign currency, or foreign exchange?
    Answer: In addition to collecting donations in Renminbi, if donors donate gold, silver, silver dollars, foreign currency, or foreign exchange, the local People's Bank of China can first exchange them at the daily exchange rate, convert them into Renminbi for accounting purposes, and issue the donor a Renminbi donation receipt. (In the Northeast region, because foreign currency and foreign exchange are not exchanged locally, the donor is given a receipt for the original currency.)
    Question: Does the People's Bank of China deduct remittance fees and handling fees for collecting donations?
    Answer: The People's Bank of China does not charge any fees for collecting weapon donations, or for printing donation receipts and statistical tables.

　　中国人民银行总行解答关于统一代收全国人民捐献飞机大炮款项的问题
    问：捐款为什么要统一由人民银行代收？
    答：人民银行的分支机构遍设全国各县市，各地行处收到捐款以后，当天就向北京汇出，由总行汇总收进抗美援朝总会的帐户内。这样可以做到将全国各地分散的捐款，迅速集中及时运用，来购置武器，满足前线和国防的需要。
    问：各地人民银行要拿什么态度和方式代收捐款？
    答：各地人民银行要用很大的力量来组织这一项工作，并且要尽量叫手续简单。收款的人要以和蔼的态度对待捐款的人。除各地所有的对外营业的单位，都可在柜台上等待捐款人往缴以外，较大的城市，捐款人还可以用电话通知当地人民银行，派人到捐款人处代收。县人民银行如干部力量许可，应派人下乡收款。
    问：人民银行代收捐款有无收据？
    答：人民银行收到捐款，立即填发三联收据：一联给捐款人，一联由银行代送当地抗美援朝分会，一联银行自存。收据的格式是全国一致的，除列有捐款人及金额等以外，并标出捐款人是工人，农民，妇女，学生，还是属于工商界，文教界，机关团体等；并标出所捐款项是购买战斗机，轰炸机，坦克车，大炮，高射炮或其他武器等类别。
    问：捐款如分期或在不同地点交付人民银行，将来凭什么向抗美援朝总会申请武器的命名？
    答：将来向抗美援朝援朝总会申请武器的命名，要凭人民银行经收捐款的收据。例如，不论在上海交的或是天津交的，六月份内交的或是七月份交的，只要汇集的收据捐额总计满了十五亿元，就可以申请一架战斗机的命名。
    问：先在人民银行以团体的名义开一个“某某号飞机”专户，凑到十五亿再正式向上交款，好吗？
    答：这样做没有必要，而且不好。因为将来命名既可凭捐款收据向抗美援朝总会申请，如果分别另设专户都等凑足再交，款子就会呆存着，不能活用了。
    问：人民银行是否代收金、银、银元、外币、外汇的捐献？
    答：人民银行除收人民币的捐款外，捐款人如捐献金、银、银元、外币、外汇，可先由当地人民银行按当日牌价收兑，折成人民币记帐，发给捐款人人民币捐款收据。（东北区因当地不经兑外币、外汇，给捐款人原币的收据。）
    问：人民银行代收捐款是否要扣汇费和手续费？
    答：人民银行代收武器捐款，以及捐款收据、统计表等的印刷，概不收取任何费用。
