　　Volunteer Army Two Anti-Tank Gunners
　　Destroy and Damage Seven Enemy Tanks in One Fell Swoop
　　[This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front: In the recent defensive battle in the Linjie area, two anti-tank gunners of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army used seventeen rocket-propelled grenades to destroy and damage seven tanks of the American invading army in thirty minutes.
　　On May 20th, this anti-tank team was ordered to cooperate with the infantry to block the enemy advancing north from Linjie. They rushed to the designated location in the middle of the night, built their positions, and waited for the battle after dawn.
　　At eight o'clock the next morning, the enemy advancing north began to attack this mountain ridge. Although the enemy's planes and artillery bombarded fiercely, the anti-tank gunners crouched calmly in their fortifications, listening intently, waiting only for the enemy's tanks to come over. Two hours later, seven enemy tanks crawled along the road, followed by several trucks full of infantry. The tanks advanced, firing machine guns and cannons. Gunner Luo Jia Kui said to the other gunner, Zhao Guangming, that they should start when the tanks reached the utility pole on the road. He suggested that he would take care of the first three tanks first, and then cooperate with Zhao Guangming to take out the last four. When the first tank crawled to the utility pole, Luo Jia Kui's rocket launcher roared. The first shell brushed over the top of the tank's turret, and then the second shell drilled into the tank. With a bang, the tank burst into flames. Luo Jia Kui immediately fired at the second tank, smashing its tracks, and the tank was paralyzed on the road. As Luo Jia Kui's gun was turning to the third tank, Zhao Guangming beat him to it and destroyed it. Seeing that the situation was not good, the tanks behind turned around and rushed off the road in a panic, retreating into the rice fields. At this time, Zhao Guangming and Luo Jia Kui's armor-piercing rocket shells had already chased after them, destroying two tanks. Zhao Guangming also destroyed the gun on another tank, and finally, one last damaged tank was followed by three American soldiers. Zhao Guangming fired another shot, killing them all. The trucks full of infantry that were following the tanks saw that the situation was not good and hurriedly turned around and fled. Luo Jia Kui and Zhao Guangming used a total of seventeen shells, and in thirty minutes, they either destroyed or damaged seven enemy tanks.

　　志愿军两位反坦克射击手
    一举毁伤敌坦克七辆
    【本报讯】据新华社朝鲜前线讯：在最近麟蹄地区的阻击战中，中国人民志愿军某部的两个反坦克手，用十七发火箭炮弹，在三十分钟内击毁、击伤了美国侵略军的七辆坦克。
    五月二十日，这个反坦克组奉命配合步兵阻击由麟蹄北犯的敌人。当天半夜里他们赶到指定地点，构筑好阵地，等待天明以后的战斗。
    第二天早晨八点钟，北犯的敌人开始向这个山岭进攻。敌人的飞机、大炮虽然轰击得很凶，反坦克射击手们却都沉着地蹲在工事里倾听着，单等敌人的坦克过来。两小时以后，七辆敌人的坦克沿着公路爬来，后面跟着几辆载满步兵的卡车。坦克一面爬，一面打着机枪和炮。射击手罗加奎对另一个射手赵光明说，等坦克进到公路上那根电线杆子跟前的时候就动手。他提出自己要先收拾前面那三辆再来配合赵光明干掉后面那四辆。当第一辆坦克刚爬到电线杆跟前时，罗加奎的火箭筒吼叫了。第一发炮弹擦着坦克的炮塔顶飞过去，接着第二发炮弹就钻进了坦克，一声爆炸，坦克燃烧起来了。罗加奎立刻向第二辆坦克射击，将它的履带击碎，那辆坦克就瘫痪在公路上了。当罗加奎的炮口正转向第三辆坦克时，赵光明却抢在他前面把它打坏了。后面的坦克一看情形不妙，扭转头慌张地冲下公路，退到稻田里。这时候赵光明和罗加奎的火箭筒穿甲弹早已追击过去，把两辆坦克击毁。赵光明又把另一辆坦克上的炮打坏，最后一辆被击伤的坦克后面还跟着三个美国兵，赵光明又补打一炮，把他们全部打死。原来跟在坦克后面的满载步兵的卡车，一看情势不好，急忙掉转头溜之大吉了。罗加奎和赵光明一共只用了十七发炮弹，三十分钟时间就把敌人七辆坦克不是打毁就是打伤了。
