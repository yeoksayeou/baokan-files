We Must Increase Production, Contribute Donations, and Give Preferential Treatment to Military Families; Strive to Propagate and Raise the Political Awareness of the Masses
    ——Letter from Zhang Zhiquan, a Labor Model in Yushe, Shanxi

Dearest Chairman Mao:
    The great birthday of the Party is approaching, and I want to celebrate the Party's thirtieth anniversary with my actual production achievements.
    Under your wise leadership and with the help and education of Party committees at all levels, and under the clear policy instructions of the government, I, Zhiquan, have become a labor model on the production front and have honorably joined the Party. This honor is brought to us by the Party.
    In order to safeguard the security of the motherland, and in response to the call of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I donated 200 jin of wheat, and my wife donated 20 eggs. My wife and I have set out a long-term donation plan, with me donating 3,000 yuan each month, and my wife donating 10 eggs. I will improve production, pay attention to technology, hoe more, apply more topdressing fertilizer, and overfulfill the original production plan, extracting 70 percent of the increased production to donate to the Volunteer Army. After propaganda and mobilization throughout the village and the group, the four groups donated a total of 1,200 jin of wheat, 86,000 yuan in Renminbi, and 300 eggs. Thirty women in the village jointly raised a pig to comfort the frontline Volunteer Army on "August 1st" [Army Day]. Everyone has set out a long-term donation plan to increase income from agricultural and sideline production.
    Our group has collectively cultivated 3.7 mu of land, all planted with improved seeds, with 400 dan of soil improved per mu. We guarantee that all the land for military families will be topdressed with fertilizer, achieving the same increased production and grain yield as our own land. We also frequently conduct on-site inspections of the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel, in order to improve it.
    Currently, we are inspecting the spring patriotic pact, revising and supplementing it to set out six summer patriotic pacts. We use the patriotic pact to examine our actions. Our group will strive to achieve field-based ear selection, separate cutting, separate threshing, and separate storage, and ensure that we harvest and till as soon as the wheat turns yellow, without letting a single grain of wheat fall, and extract 50 percent of the wheat from the overfulfilled production to donate to the Volunteer Army. At the same time, we will pay the public grain on time, and select good wheat. Fifty percent of the autumn fields will be worked with weeding hoes and hollow hoes, and topdressing fertilizer will be applied to 50 percent of the land, to further develop the patriotic production increase competition.
    I will definitely lead the village reading group, propagandists, spare-time school, and youth literacy classes well, to implement the Party's and the government's policies, instructions, and laws among the masses, and raise the political awareness of the masses.
    I want to do the above work to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party. I wish Chairman Mao and the members of the Central Committee good health forever, and may they lead us well towards a socialist future!
    With dearest respect!
    Dazhai Village, Yushe, Shanxi.  Zhang Zhiquan

　　我们要增产捐献和优待军属  努力宣传提高群众政治觉悟
    ——山西榆社劳动模范张志全的信亲爱的毛主席：
    伟大的党的生日快来到了，我要拿我的实际生产成果来庆祝党的三十周年。
    我志全在你的英明指导及各级党委的帮助教育下，在政府明确的政策指示下，当了生产战线上的劳动模范，光荣地入了党。这一荣幸是党给我们带来的。
    我为了保卫祖国安全，响应抗美援朝总会号召，捐献了二百斤麦子，我女人捐献了二十个鸡蛋。我与我女人定出长期捐献计划，每月我捐献三千元，我女人捐献鸡蛋十个。我把生产搞好，讲究技术，多锄，多上追肥，超过原计划增产，抽出增产的百分之七十献给志愿军。经过在全村全组宣传动员，四个组共捐献小麦一千二百斤，人民币八万六千元，鸡蛋三百个。全村三十个妇女伙喂一口猪，到“八一”慰问前线志愿军。每个人都定出长期捐献计划，增加农副业收入。
    俺组共代耕三亩七分地，全部种优良种籽，每亩改良土壤四百担。保证全部给军属的地上追肥，与自己地同样增产打粮。并且互相经常实地检查优待烈属军属工作，以便改进。
    当前我们在检查春季爱国公约，修改补充定出夏季六项爱国公约。根据爱国公约来检查我们行动。俺组要做到田间穗选，单割、单打、单放，并做到随黄随割随耕，不让弄掉一粒麦籽，把超过原计划增产的小麦，抽出百分之五十捐献给志愿军。同时按时把公粮缴纳，并选择好麦。秋田百分之五十用耘锄与空心锄，使百分之五十土地上追肥，进一步开展爱国主义丰产竞赛。
    我一定把全村读报组与宣传员及业余学校、青年补习班领导好，把党与政府的政策指示法令，贯彻到群众中去，提高群众政治觉悟。
    我要做好以上工作来纪念党的三十周年纪念日。祝毛主席和中央委员永远健康，好好领导我们向社会主义前途迈进！
    此致亲爱的敬礼！
    山西榆社大寨村  张志全
