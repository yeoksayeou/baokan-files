　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. The investigation team of the International Democratic Women's Federation on the atrocities of the US military in Korea held a press conference here on the 1st. The head of the investigation team, Mrs. Rodd, the representative of Canada, first described the organization's process and purpose. In answering questions raised by reporters, Abassia, the representative of Algeria, said: What impressed me most on this trip was that from Sinuiju to Pyongyang, we saw that almost all the houses were destroyed, including schools, churches, and hospitals with Red Cross symbols. Women and children had to live in air-raid shelters. We were very moved by the heroic struggle of the Korean people for national independence.
　　Le Thi Que, the representative of Vietnam, pointed out: The US military destroyed Korean cities and villages, leaving only bricks, tiles, and ashes, and massacred many Korean people, even burying mothers carrying children alive; but these atrocities cannot stop the heroic struggle of the Korean people. I realized this in conversations with many Koreans. The Korean people will surely win the final victory because their war is just.
　　Fatema, the representative of Tunisia, talked about the bombing of Andong and said: Andong is Chinese territory. We saw many houses destroyed by bombing in Andong. The bombing of Chinese territory by US planes is indeed an act of challenge.
　　In answering the question of how they will carry out their work after returning to their countries, Gala, the representative of Italy, said: We will tell the whole world everything we have seen and launch a movement to oppose American imperialism. We will distribute the evidence we collected in Korea, and we will hold report meetings, photo exhibitions, screen documentaries, and use various methods for publicity. We will live up to the expectations of the Korean people who are fighting for their freedom and for world peace.

　　在全世界发动仇视美帝国主义运动
    积极支援为和平而战的朝鲜人民
    国际妇联调查团在沈阳对记者表示
    【新华社沈阳二日电】国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团，一日在此间举行记者招待会。调查团团长、加拿大代表罗德夫人首先叙述了该团组织的经过和目的。在答复记者们所提出的问题时，阿尔及利亚代表阿巴西亚说：此行印象最深的是：从新义州到平壤，我们看到全部房子几乎都被破坏了，其中有学校、教堂和带红十字标志的医院。妇女和儿童只得住在防空洞里。而朝鲜人民为祖国独立英勇地斗争，使我们很感动。
    越南代表黎氏桂指出：美军把朝鲜的城市和乡村破坏得只剩下砖瓦和灰烬，屠杀了很多朝鲜人民，甚至把背着小孩的母亲一起活埋；但这些暴行不能阻止朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。我在和很多朝鲜人谈话中体会到这一点。朝鲜人民必能赢得最后胜利，因为他们的战争是正义的。
    突尼斯代表法特马谈到安东被炸时说：安东是中国领土，我们在安东看到很多房屋被炸毁。美机轰炸中国领土实在是一种挑战行为。
    在回答她们回国后怎样展开工作的问题时，意大利代表加拉说：我们会把我们所见的一切告诉全世界，并发动仇视美帝国主义的运动。我们将分发我们在朝鲜搜集的证据，并将开报告会、照片展览会，放映记录影片和用各种方法宣传。我们将不辜负那些为自己的自由和为世界和平而战的朝鲜人民。
