　　Steel Gates Begin to be Installed at Locks

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Construction of the Soviet Volga-Don Canal is proceeding vigorously. According to a TASS report: The installation of huge steel gates and various special equipment has begun at the canal's locks. These gates are all welded instead of riveted, saving a considerable amount of metal during manufacturing. The operation of the gates is fully automated, and a single technician managing the central control panel can operate all the work of the locks. The construction of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric station is expanding daily. Assembly workers are building the huge five-story framework of the power plant. They will build the foundation for the fixed part of the hydraulic turbines in June, and install 3,000 tons of various metal structures and equipment in the hydroelectric station this year. The hydroelectric station will also install special equipment to prevent fish in the lower reaches of the Don from being affected when they swim upstream through the locks to spawn.

　　An underground channel has been dug from the canal's main line to draw water from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir to irrigate the dry Salsk Steppe. The first six-kilometer section of the channel is 350 meters complete. This is an extremely complex construction project, where construction workers must excavate large amounts of soil in various geological layers and lay water pipes with a total weight of tens of thousands of tons. The construction work is highly mechanized. After the underground channel is completed, the water flow rate will reach 150,000 cubic meters per hour. (Attached picture)

　　苏联伏尔加河——顿河运河
    各处水闸开始装配钢质水门
    【新华社十五日讯】苏联伏尔加河——顿河运河的建设工程正在大力进行着。据塔斯社消息：运河的各处水闸已开始装配巨大的钢质水门和各种特殊设备。这些水门全部都是焊接的，而不是用铆钉钉住的，制造时节省了不少金属。水门的操纵完全自动化，只需一个技师管理中央闸盘就能操纵水闸的一切工作，齐姆良水电站的建设工作日渐扩大，装配工人正在建造发电厂五层楼的巨大构架。他们将在六月间建造好水力透平的固定部分的地基，今年内将在水电站装置三千吨的各种金属结构和设备。水电站还要装置特殊设备，使顿河下游的鱼类溯流通过水闸到上游产卵时不受影响。
    从运河干线已开凿了一条地下渠道，以便把齐姆良水库的水引来灌溉干燥的萨尔斯克草原。渠道的第一段六公里的工程已完成三百五十公尺。这是一项极为复杂的建筑工程，建筑工人必须在各种不同的地层中挖掘出大量的泥土，并敷设总重量数万吨的水管。建设工作已高度机械化。地下渠道完成后，每小时的流水量可达十五万立方公尺。（附图片）
