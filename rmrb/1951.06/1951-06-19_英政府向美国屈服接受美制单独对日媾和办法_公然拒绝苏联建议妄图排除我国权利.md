Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth of June dispatch from London: Dulles, Truman's special envoy and warmonger, concluded his negotiations with the British government in London on the separate peace treaty with Japan on the 14th, and left Britain for the US on the same day.

The joint communique issued by Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Morrison in London on the evening of the 14th after the negotiations showed that Britain has further succumbed to the United States and basically accepted the US method of a separate peace treaty with Japan.

In the communique, the US and British governments openly rejected the Soviet government's proposal, based on the Potsdam Agreement, to hold a meeting of foreign ministers to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan, attempting to exclude the undeniable and legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. The communique stated: "The two governments cannot accept the Soviet government's continued insistence that the peace treaty must be prepared by a meeting of foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China." According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, on the 14th, the method secretly plotted by the US and Britain to exclude the People's Republic of China is: "Allowing Japan to choose for itself which Chinese government it wishes to sign a peace treaty with," "The United States undoubtedly believes that Tokyo will follow the advice of the United States and make peace with the Chiang Kai-shek government." The US and British governments also agreed not to "mention" Taiwan at all in the separate peace treaty with Japan, plotting to betray the Cairo Declaration regarding the return of Taiwan to China, and infringing upon China's sacred territorial sovereignty over Taiwan. The Agence France-Presse dispatch also revealed that Britain also agreed to the US policy of rearming Japan.

However, on the other hand, the differences between the US and Britain due to their respective interests have not been completely eliminated in this negotiation. According to the Associated Press, there are still "several minor issues to be resolved," and it is said that: "These issues include: the issue of compensation for British citizens who suffered losses in the Pacific War, and easing Britain's fears about Japan's competition in shipping and textiles after the conclusion of the peace treaty."

　　英政府向美国屈服接受美制单独对日媾和办法        
    公然拒绝苏联建议妄图排除我国权利
    【新华社十八日讯】伦敦消息：杜鲁门的特别代表、战争贩子杜勒斯和英国政府在伦敦举行的关于单独对日媾和的谈判，已于十四日结束，杜勒斯已于当天离英返美。
    杜勒斯和英国外相莫里逊在谈判结束后于十四日晚在伦敦发表的联合公报表明，英国已进一步向美国屈服，基本上接受了美国单独对日媾和的办法。
    美英两国政府在公报中，公然拒绝苏联政府根据波茨坦协定所提出的举行外长会议来准备对日和约的建议，妄图排除中华人民共和国和苏联在对日和约问题上的不可抹煞的正当权利。公报说：“苏联政府继续坚持和约必须由美国、联合王国、苏联和中国的外长会议去准备，两国政府不能接受这种意见。”据法新社伦敦十四日电透露，美英两国所密谋的排除中华人民共和国的方法是：“允许日本自行选择它愿意与那一个中国政府签订和约”，“美国无疑地认为东京将追随美国的劝告，与蒋介石政府媾和”。美英两国政府并同意在单独对日和约中根本不“提到”台湾，阴谋背弃开罗宣言关于台湾必须归还中国的规定，侵犯中国对台湾的神圣领土主权。法新社的消息还透露，英国也同意了美国重新武装日本的政策。
    但是在另一方面，美英两国由于各自的利益所产生的分歧，并未完全在这次谈判中消除。据美联社透露，现在还有“几个小问题尚待解决”，据称：“这些问题有：对在太平洋战争中个人受到损失的英国公民的赔偿问题，以及缓和英国对于缔结和约后日本在船运和纺织方面的竞争的恐惧心理的问题。”
