　　Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Directive
    Lead Farmers to Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Striving for a Bumper Cotton Harvest" on the 23rd of this month. The instructions stated: Thanks to the arduous efforts of local people's governments and the broad masses of farmers, the national cotton planting task has now been overfulfilled, and cotton seedlings are growing well in most areas. This is a great achievement. However, this is only the first step in completing the cotton planting work. The more important issue is how to lead and organize farmers, adopt all effective methods, overcome various natural disasters, and ensure the smooth growth of cotton seedlings. To this end, the following instructions are specifically made:
    (1) Local agricultural leading bodies should vigorously lead farmers in preventing and controlling insect pests: At present, cotton aphids, red spiders, snails, leaf rollers, and other pests have become widespread in the north and the Yangtze River basin, harming cotton seedlings. Localities should quickly organize farmers to eliminate and kill them. In prevention and control, in addition to organizing farmers to make full use of existing pesticides and machinery, localities should also rush to produce a large amount of cotton oil soap for farmers to use in preventing and controlling cotton aphids and red spiders. In addition, localities must improve and strengthen the pest control information system, inspect the fields at any time, and carry out elimination and treatment immediately upon discovering pests.
    (2) Mobilize and organize farmers to apply topdressing fertilizer: Strive to apply topdressing fertilizer once to most cotton fields, and strive for early application. When local people's governments mobilize farmers to sell cotton to the state and store cotton, they should call on farmers to use the proceeds from cotton sales or use cotton to purchase or exchange fertilizer from local native produce companies and cooperatives in order to apply it in a timely manner.
    (3) Guide farmers in carrying out appropriate topping and pruning work to prevent cotton plants from growing only branches and leaves and not producing cotton bolls. Due to the expansion of cotton field area this year, the increase in new cotton fields, and the fact that farmers in various places have greatly increased the application of fertilizer, more attention must be paid to the topping and pruning work of cotton plants. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and training for farmers in cotton management, summarize the cotton planting experience of labor models and farmers, and introduce and promote them in a timely manner.
    (4) Organize farmers to carry out timely cotton field cultivation, weeding, irrigation, drainage, and other work to ensure vigorous growth of cotton seedlings; at the same time, special attention must be paid to preventing both drought and flood, and more hoeing should be promoted in order to maintain soil moisture in the cotton fields and increase cotton yield.
    For the above tasks, each province and region should, according to the specific circumstances, adopt effective measures in light of local conditions, organize all possible forces, and increase the unit area yield of cotton in order to strive to complete and exceed the cotton production plan for 1951.

### 中央人民政府农业部指示  领导农民争取棉花丰收

　　中央人民政府农业部指示
    领导农民争取棉花丰收
    中央人民政府农业部本月二十三日发布“关于争取棉花丰收的指示”。指示称：由于各地人民政府及广大农民的艰苦努力，现在全国已超额完成了棉花播种任务，且大部地区的棉苗生长良好。这是一个很大的成绩。但是，这只是完成植棉工作的第一步，更重要的问题是如何领导与组织农民，采用一切有效办法，克服各种自然灾害，保证棉苗的顺利生长。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）各地农业领导机关应大力领导农民防治虫害：目前北方各地和长江流域地区，已普遍发生棉蚜、红蜘蛛、蜗牛、卷叶虫等害虫为害棉苗，各地应迅速组织农民进行除治与捕杀。在防治中，各地除组织农民充分使用现有药械外，并应赶制大量棉油皂，以供农民防治棉蚜和红蜘蛛之用。此外，各地还须健全和严密防治虫害的情报制度，应做到随时到地里查看，发现虫害立即进行除治。
    （二）发动与组织农民施用追肥：争取大部棉田普施追肥一次，并争取早施。各地人民政府在发动农民向国家售棉储棉时，应号召农民以售棉所得或用棉花向各地土产公司和合作社购肥、换肥，以便及时施用。
    （三）指导农民进行适宜的摘心整枝工作，以防止棉棵只长枝叶，不结棉桃。由于今年棉田面积扩大，新棉田增多，加之各地农民大量增施肥料的缘故，更须注意棉棵的摘心整枝工作。为此，必须加强对农民管理棉花的技术指导与训练，总结劳动模范和农民的植棉经验，及时加以介绍、推广。
    （四）组织农民适时地进行棉田的中耕锄草、灌溉、排水等工作，以保证棉苗发育旺盛；同时尤须注意旱涝并防，提倡多锄，以便保持棉田的水分提高棉花产量。
    以上各项工作，各省、区应根据具体情况，因地制宜，采取有效措施，组织一切可能的力量，提高棉花单位面积产量，以争取完成和超过一九五一年的棉花生产计划。（新华社）
