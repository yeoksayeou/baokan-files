Most of the spring repair projects for rivers across the country, which began comprehensively in early April, have now been completed in East China and Central South China, with the exception of the Huaihe and Yellow Rivers. The projects for rivers in North China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia are also nearing completion. This spring, the focus in Northwest and Southwest China is mainly on repairing farmland irrigation. The scale of this year's spring repair projects for rivers nationwide is very large, with a total of over five million laborers participating in the projects nationwide.

The Huaihe River is the focus of this year's spring water conservancy repairs and the first spring project for fundamentally controlling the Huaihe River. Currently, a total of 2.2 million laborers are participating in the Huaihe River project in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, along with tens of thousands of technical workers, engineers, students, medical personnel, and cadres serving the project. In total, over 70 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed along the entire Huaihe River, equivalent to more than 83 percent of the total earthwork planned for the first year of the Huaihe River project. The mountain valley reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River and the large flood storage projects above Zhengyangguan in the middle reaches are proceeding at full speed, while the reinforcement project of the Li Canal dikes in the lower reaches has been completed. The completion of these projects will ensure that the areas along the Huaihe River can "reduce disasters in the event of heavy rain and avoid disasters in the event of light rain" this year.

Regarding the Yellow River, the main task this spring is to continue reinforcing the Yellow River dikes. Since construction began in mid-March, more than 290,000 laborers from counties and districts along the Yellow River in Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces have completed over 14 million cubic meters of dike restoration earthwork. The goal of this project is to defend against Yellow River floods with a flow rate not exceeding 18,000 cubic meters per second at Shan County. However, in order to defend against even larger floods on the Yellow River, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission recently jointly decided with the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government and the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to add another 12.5 million cubic meters of earthwork to reinforce the Yellow River dikes, in addition to the completed sections. This mainly involves reinforcing the Limin Dike (dikes close to the river channel) of the Yellow River tributary Qinhe River to a section near Fengqiu County, and the Yellow River Jin Dike (i.e., remote dikes) between Puyang, Puxian, Shouzhang, and Dong'a counties. This project has now begun and is planned to be completed before the arrival of the Yellow River summer flood season.

Farmers in the Central South region completed over 113 million cubic meters of earthwork in river repairs this spring (excluding the project in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River in Henan Province). Among these spring repair projects, the main task in Central China was to reinforce the Jingjiang Dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, to protect 8 million mu of farmland on the Jianghan Plain. In South China, the main task was to reinforce the main dikes and embankments of various rivers in Guangdong Province. In addition, farmers in Hubei Province also focused on reinforcing the Huayan Temple Main Dike of the Hanshui River, which breached last summer, and farmers in Hunan Province reinforced the dikes and embankments along Dongting Lake and the dikes of the Xiang and Yuan Rivers.

In East China, the spring repair project of the Xinyi River in northern Jiangsu ended in late April. A total of 220,000 laborers participated in the construction. They completed the excavation of the middle reaches of the Xinyi River channel and the dredging of drainage channels in the areas on both sides of the Xinyi River, completing a total of over 12 million cubic meters of earthwork. This not only enables the Xinyi River to safely discharge a flow rate of 3,200 cubic meters per second this summer, but also reduces the disasters caused by waterlogging in the areas on both sides of the Xinyi River in northern Jiangsu.

For the several rivers in North China that cause significant harm, such as the Yongding River, this spring mainly focused on restoring dikes and consolidating the downstream flooded areas to protect the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and 69 percent of the spring repair plan has now been completed. The Chaobai River is continuing last year's project to consolidate the new downstream channel, and 71 percent of the plan has now been completed. The focus of the Daqing River spring repairs is: opening temporary diversion channels in the middle reaches and carrying out drainage projects in the Nanliang ditch and the Wen'an depression areas, and starting the Duliu into the sea reduction river project in the lower reaches. These projects are currently underway.

The goal of this spring's repair and defense projects for various rivers in the Northeast region is to protect the 4 million mu of previously flooded farmland in the entire region from being flooded again. The projects on various rivers are currently underway. This spring, the Inner Mongolia region is mainly focusing on repairing and consolidating the dangerous sections of the Xiliao River and newly opened river dikes, which have not yet been completed.

### 全国各河流春修工程大部完成  淮河、黄河巨大工程正在继续进行

　　全国各河流春修工程大部完成
    淮河、黄河巨大工程正在继续进行
    全国各河流的春修工程，自四月初全面开始以来，到现在止，华东和中南除淮河和黄河以外，各河流工程都已经完成了，华北和东北、内蒙各河流的工程也将完成。西北和西南今春主要是修农田水利。今年全国各河的春修工程的规模很大，总计全国参加工程的民工在五百万人以上。
    淮河是今年全国水利春修的重点，也是根治淮河的第一个春季工程。现在，淮河上、中、下游两岸地区参加治淮的民工共有二百二十万人，为治淮工程服务的技术工人、工程师、学生、医务人员及干部等数以万计。总计淮河全线现已完成了七千多万土方，相当于治淮第一年度计划土工总数的百分之八十三以上。淮河上游的山谷水库和中游正阳关以上的大蓄洪工程正在加紧进行，下游的里运河堤防加固工程已经完工。这些工程的完成，将保证今年沿淮河地区“大雨减灾，小雨免灾”。
    黄河方面，今春主要是继续培修黄河大堤。河南、平原、山东三省沿黄河县、区的二十九万多民工，从三月中开始动工以来，共已完成复堤土工一千四百多万公方。这一工程是以防御黄河洪水在陕县的流量不超过一万八千秒公方为目标的。但是，为了防御黄河更大的洪水，黄河水利委员会最近特与平原省人民政府及中共平原省委共同决定，除已完工部分外，再增加培修黄河大堤土工一千二百五十万公方，主要是加修黄河支流沁河河堤到封邱县附近一段的临黄堤（靠近黄河河漕的堤防），和濮阳、濮县、寿张、东阿等县间的黄河金堤（即遥堤）。现在，这项工程已经开始，计划在黄河夏汛到来前可以完成。
    中南区农民在今春修河中共作了一亿一千三百多万公方土工（河南省境淮河上游的工程不在此内）。在这些春修工程中，华中地区主要是培修湖北省长江北岸的荆江大堤，以保障江、汉平原上的八百万亩农田；华南地区主要是培修广东省各江的主要堤围。此外，湖北省农民还着重加修了去夏曾经决口的汉水华严寺干堤，湖南省农民加修了洞庭湖沿湖的堤垸和湘、沅两江的堤防。
    华东方面，苏北新沂河的春修工程在四月下旬即已结束。参加修筑的民工共有二十二万人。他们完成了开挖新沂河的中游水道和疏浚新沂河两岸地区的排水道工程，共作土工一千二百多万公方。这不仅使新沂河今夏可以安全排泄三千二百秒公方的流量，同时也减轻了苏北新沂河两岸地区因内涝而引起的灾害。
    华北为害较大的几条河流，如永定河，今春主要是复堤和整理下游泛区工程，以保护京山铁路和京汉铁路，现已完成春修计划的百分之六十九。潮白河是继续去年工程，整理下游新河道，现已完成计划的百分之七十一。大清河春修的重点是：在中游开临时分洪道及进行南梁沟洼和文安洼一带的排水工程，在下游开始进行独流入海减河工程。这些工程目前仍在加紧进行。
    东北区各河今春的修防工程，以保卫全区四百万亩曾经受淹的农田不再受淹为目标。各河工程现正加紧进行中。内蒙区今春以修整西辽河及新开河堤防的险工为主，目前尚未完工。
