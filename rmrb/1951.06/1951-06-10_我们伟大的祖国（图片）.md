     This is a corner of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, Gansu. The Mogao Caves are located twenty kilometers southeast of Dunhuang County. Since the first cave was opened one thousand five hundred and eighty-five years ago, there are now four hundred and sixty-nine caves, winding along the eight-mile-long cliff wall. These caves preserve murals and statues from various dynasties. This is one of the treasure troves of our people's incredibly rich artistic relics.
