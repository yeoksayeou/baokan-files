　　Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, New York dispatch: The United States Supreme Court approved on June 4th the New York Federal Court's sentencing of eleven leaders of the American Communist Party. Dennis, Hall, Williamson, Gates, Winston, Potash, Green, Davis, Stachel, and Winter, all members of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, were sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000. Thompson, another member of the National Committee, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $10,000.
　　American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, after the Supreme Court's verdict was announced, issued a statement saying, "The only 'crime' of the Communist leaders is that they advocate peace and social progress, and they oppose war and fascism." He said, "Reactionaries will try to use this verdict not only to suppress the Communist Party but also to crush labor unions, intensify the terror against black people, and suffocate the growing peace movement." Dennis emphasized that the power of people's unity can still stop the American imitators of Hitler and Tojo. Dennis resolutely declared, "No matter what happens, the Communist Party will continue to work to unite the American people against those monopolists and their political agents who are trying to plunge our country into the disaster of a third world war. No matter what happens, the cause of peace, democracy, and social progress will continue to gain supporters and defeat its enemies."
　　As early as July 1948, the U.S. government unreasonably arrested twelve leaders of the American Communist Party. This case opened on January 17, 1949, in the New York Federal Court (American Communist Party Chairman Foster, one of the twelve, was dealt with separately due to illness.) Medina, the New York Federal Court judge presiding over the case, on October 21st of that year, sentenced the above-mentioned to imprisonment and fines on the charge of "inciting the overthrow of the U.S. government by violence," and imprisoned the defendants. Regarding this verdict, the American Communist Party leaders then filed an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals decided to uphold the original verdict. Later, the American Communist Party leaders appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court initially attempted to refuse to hear the appeal, but due to pressure from the people, it later had to agree to hear the appeal, but the result was still approval of the original verdict.

　　美最高法院不顾人民反对
    竟判处美共领袖徒刑     
    但尼斯声明决继续反对暴政
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：美国最高法院于六月四日批准纽约联邦法院对美国共产党十一位领袖的判决。美共全国委员会委员但尼斯、霍尔、威廉逊、盖兹、温斯顿、鲍达希、葛麟、戴维斯、史塔彻、温特尔十人被判处五年徒刑和一万美元罚金，另一全国委员会委员汤普生被判处三年徒刑和一万美元罚金。
    美国共产党总书记但尼斯在最高法院宣判后发表声明说：“共产党的领袖们唯一的‘罪状’是他们主张和平与社会进步，他们反对战争与法西斯主义。”他说：“反动派将设法利用这个判决，不仅镇压共产党，而且粉碎工会、加剧对黑种人民的恐怖和窒息生长中的和平运动。”但尼斯强调指出：人民团结的力量还来得及制止希特勒和东条的美国仿效者。但尼斯坚决宣告：“不论发生什么事情，共产党都要继续努力，团结美国人民，反对那些力谋把我们的国家投入第三次世界大战的灾难的垄断资本家及其政治代理人。不管发生什么事情，和平、民主及社会进步的事业都会继续获得支持者并战胜它的敌人。”
    早在一九四八年七月，美国政府就无理逮捕了美共的十二个领袖。这个案件于一九四九年一月十七日在纽约联邦法院开审，（十二人中的美共主席福斯特因病另行处理。）承审的纽约联邦法院法官麦迪纳于是年十月二十一日以所谓“教唆以暴力推翻美国政府”罪判处以上述的徒刑与罚款，并将被告下狱。对于这个判决，美共领袖接着就向纽约上诉法院提出了上诉，结果上诉法院决定维持原判，后来美共领袖又向最高法院提出上诉，最高法院最初竟曾企图拒绝受理上诉，但是迫于人民的压力，后来才不得不同意受理上诉，而结果还是批准了原判。
