Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The entire delegation of industry and commerce to Korea held a forum to discuss their experiences and insights from the visit, and to discuss the future tasks of industry and commerce in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The forum was convened by Chen Siyi, a representative of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce. Attendees included Zhu Jisheng, representative of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Lin Houzhou, representative of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Yizhi, representative of the Lanzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, and more than ten representatives of industry and commerce from Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Chahar, and other places. At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically and unanimously agreed that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, and also the deadly enemy of China's national industrialists and businessmen. Participants said they were deeply moved by the bravery, resourcefulness, tenacity, and arduous fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. Everyone supported Chen Siyi's proposal in Pyongyang to donate airplanes, automobiles, tanks, artillery, and other supplies to support the front, and called on the national industrial and commercial circles to donate generously.

　　Chen Siyi explained in detail at the meeting the destruction of Korean national industry by the U.S. military. He said that not only were the factory machines in Korea dismantled and taken away, but even the hand-operated hosiery machines in the countryside were also taken away by the U.S. military. I painfully realized that imperialism is irreconcilable with our industry and commerce. If the American troops invading Korea are not completely defeated, our country cannot carry out construction in peace, and the survival and development of industry and commerce will be threatened. Chen Siyi further emphasized the great significance of industry and commerce conducting a weapon donation movement. He said: After we arrived at the front, we deeply understood that the materials we donated in the past were not suitable for the needs of the front. This donation movement must be well planned, widely solicited, and sent to the front. His speech aroused warm applause.

　　Zhu Jisheng said: "The development and prosperity of China's national industry and commerce today has been liberated from the immense oppression of imperialist economic aggression. The reason we can live and work in peace and enjoy peace and happiness today is because the volunteer soldiers are using their blood and lives to defend the motherland and defeat American imperialism and its accomplices at the front. Our excellent sons and daughters are continuing to fight bravely against the enemy in Korea. This just war of anti-aggression will undoubtedly end with the final victory belonging to the Chinese and Korean people. But American imperialism is a stubborn enemy. If we can do our best to specifically donate airplanes, automobiles, carts, stretcher carts, food, medicines, vitamin pills, medical equipment, cultural and entertainment supplies (such as books, newspapers, radios, recordings, etc.), we can not only improve the material conditions of our volunteer army, but also encourage morale at the front, so that our victory will come sooner! This glorious practical action should be planned in detail and launched immediately so that all people in industry and commerce can participate together and enthusiastically contribute." He also suggested that industry and commerce should strictly check the implementation of the patriotic pact in the future, actively participate in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, work hard to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, resolutely support the government's policies and decrees, and strive to ensure price stability and tax completion.

　　Wang Yizhi reported to the forum that he had received a letter from the Lanzhou industrial and commercial community expressing their support for Chen Siyi's call to donate aircraft, automobiles, and other weapons. Lanzhou City has now launched a movement to prepay taxes. Within three days, twenty-four industries lined up, beat gongs and drums, and went to pay taxes in advance. Wang Yizhi promised to do a good job in publicity after returning to Lanzhou, calling on local industry and commerce to donate weapons enthusiastically.

　　Lin Houzhou said: If it were not for the volunteer army going abroad to resist American aggression, Chinese cities might have suffered disasters like Korea. When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. If the city is destroyed, where will there be industry and commerce? He suggested that industry and commerce discuss a specific method for donating airplanes and automobiles, and formulate a relatively long-term donation method, such as implementing savings and donating according to business, surplus, and other items. Industry and commerce should automatically and consciously launch a donation challenge and strive for the glorious title of "Resist America, Aid Korea Industry and Commerce." He said that the Wuhan industrial and commercial community has already sent him a letter expressing their support for the donation movement.

　　Other representatives also spoke enthusiastically and unanimously expressed their support for the donation movement. The forum finally decided to call on the national industrial and commercial circles to launch a donation movement to support the front.

　　赴朝慰问团全体工商界代表
    号召全国工商界踊跃捐献
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民赴朝慰问团的全体工商界代表，曾举行座谈会，交谈这次赴朝慰问过程中的见闻、认识，并讨论今后工商界在抗美援朝运动中的任务等问题。座谈会由上海工商联代表陈巳生召集，出席者有：天津工商界联合会代表朱继圣、武汉工商联代表林厚周、兰州工商联代表王宜之以及北京、上海、湖北、重庆、广州、南昌、察哈尔等地工商界的代表十余人。会上大家踊跃发言，一致认为美帝国主义是中、朝人民的共同敌人，也正是中国民族工商业者的死敌。与会者都说，他们深深地为朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军的英勇、机智、顽强、艰苦的作战精神所感动。大家都拥护陈巳生在平壤发起的工商界捐献飞机、汽车、坦克、大炮等支援前线的倡议，并且号召全国工商界踊跃捐献。
     陈巳生在会上详细说明朝鲜民族工业被美军摧毁的情形。他说，不但朝鲜的工厂机器被拆走，连农村中的手工业织袜机也一齐被美军搬走了。我痛切地认识到：帝国主义与我国工商业是势不两立的。侵略朝鲜的美国军队不被彻底打败，我国就不可能安安稳稳地进行建设，工商业的生存和发展就受到威胁。陈巳生进而再一次强调工商业进行捐献武器运动的重大意义。他说：我们到了前线后，深切地了解过去我们捐献的物资还不够切合前线需要。这次捐献运动要好好计划，广泛征集，送到前线去。他的发言激起了热烈的掌声。
    朱继圣说：“中国民族工商业今天的发展与繁荣，是从帝国主义经济侵略的万重压迫下解放出来的。我们今天所以能安居乐业，享受和平幸福，是由于志愿军战士们在前方用血与生命保卫祖国、打败美帝国主义及其帮凶而得来的。我国优秀的儿女正在朝鲜继续与敌人英勇斗争。这个正义的反侵略战争，毫无疑义地最后胜利必属于中朝人民。但美帝国主义是一个顽强的敌人，倘使我们能尽最大力量，具体地捐献飞机、汽车、大车、担架车、食品、药品、维他命丸、医疗器械、文化娱乐用品（如书报、收音机、录音片等等）等，我们不仅能增进我们志愿军的物质条件，并且更可鼓励前方的士气，使我们的胜利提早到来！这个光荣的实际行动，我们应详细计划，立即发动，使全体工商界人士共同参加，踊跃输将。”他还建议工商界今后应严格检查爱国公约的实行情况，积极参加镇压反革命的斗争，努力搞好拥军优属工作，坚决支持政府的政策法令，努力保证物价的稳定和税收的完成。
    王宜之向座谈会报告说：他已接到兰州工商界的来信，表示拥护陈巳生的捐献飞机、汽车等武器的号召。兰州市现在已展开预缴税款运动，在三天之内就有二十四个行业排着队、敲锣打鼓，提前去缴税。王宜之保证回到兰州后要做好宣传工作，号召当地工商界踊跃捐献武器。
    林厚周说：假若不是志愿军出国抵抗美国的侵略，中国的城市也可能受到朝鲜那样的大灾难。覆巢之下无完卵，都市被毁了，那里还有工商业？他建议工商界商量出一个具体的捐献飞机和汽车的办法，并订出比较长期性的捐献办法，例如实行节约，按营业、盈余等项目来捐献。工商界要自动自觉地展开一个捐献挑战，争取“抗美援朝工商界”的光荣称号。他说：武汉工商界已有信给他，表示拥护捐献运动。
    其他各代表也都热烈地发言，一致表示拥护捐献运动。座谈会最后决定号召全国工商界展开捐献运动，支援前线。
