    Unreasonable Salaries for Elementary School Teachers in Many Places; Relevant Departments in Various Regions Should Conscientiously Pay Attention to Rectification

    To the Editorial Staff:

    In order to understand the reasons why some elementary school teachers are not settled in their work, we conducted a relatively detailed survey in Qingyuan County. The results of this survey show that one of the fundamental reasons for elementary school teachers changing professions is excessively low material compensation. Elementary school teachers not only have low salary standards, but their actual income is also reduced due to inconsistent payment standards and unreasonable millet price conversions. Many counties in Hebei Province have unreasonable situations in the payment of elementary school teachers:

    1.  Millet conversion is far below market price: For example, in Qianxi County, teachers' salaries for April were converted at 770 yuan per jin of millet, while the market price of millet at that time was over 850 yuan per jin, meaning 80 yuan less was paid per jin. In Funing County, the millet conversion rate in March was 650 yuan per jin, while the market price of millet at that time was around 800 yuan per jin, meaning about 150 yuan less was received per jin. This resulted in elementary school teachers receiving one to two months' less salary for the entire year.

    2.  In some areas, such as Handan County, salaries for January and February were paid according to the Government Administration Council's stipulated financial millet price; however, after the salary increase in March, this regulation was no longer followed. Thus, the "salary increase" became an increase in name but a decrease in reality. For example, teacher Niu Fangpu's salary in February was 180 jin of millet, which after conversion amounted to 180,000 yuan. In March, his salary increased to 210 jin of millet, but because the government did not pay salaries according to the financial millet price, he actually only received 168,000 yuan. Thus, after the salary increase, he received 12,000 yuan less per month than before the increase.

    3.  Issuing bad rice. In the past, places such as Guan, Anxin, Wangdu, Xiong, and Tang Counties have issued bad rice to elementary school teachers. When teachers raised concerns, the administration did not correct the issue. For example, after bad rice was issued in Guan County, union cadres raised concerns with the administration, but the head of the education section said the union was opposing the government, scaring the union cadres into silence.

    4.  Converting to coarse grains fails to guarantee actual wages. In March, some counties in the Tangshan Special District issued a lot of small beans. For example, in the Chuzhuang Complete Elementary School in the Sixth District of Qianxi County, some small beans were given as part of the 1,000 jin of millet salary, with a conversion rate of 18 liang of small beans per jin of millet. At that time, millet was priced at 800 yuan per jin, and small beans were priced at 640 yuan per jin. In this case one hundred jin meant a loss of 8,000 yuan.

    Some places are currently rectifying these unreasonable situations (such as Ding County), but others have not yet done so. Therefore, we suggest that relevant leading bodies conduct in-depth inspections of elementary school teacher salary issues and thoroughly correct these unreasonable phenomena in order to guarantee the livelihood of elementary school teachers and facilitate the development of elementary school education.

    Editor's Note: This newspaper has previously published readers' opinions requesting a solution to the salary problem of elementary school teachers. As can be seen from the letter from the Hebei Provincial Working Committee of the China Education Trade Union, this issue has not been completely resolved in all regions to date. It is hoped that the People's Governments in various regions will earnestly inspect and resolve this issue, as it is a major event related to elementary school education.

### 许多地方小学教员薪资不合理　各地有关部门应切实注意纠正

    许多地方小学教员薪资不合理
　　各地有关部门应切实注意纠正编辑同志：
    为了了解某些小学教员不安心工作的原因，我们曾在清苑县作了一次较详细的调查。从这次调查结果看出：小学教员转业的根本原因之一，是物质待遇太低。小学教员不但薪金规定的低，并且还因支付标准不一致，米价折款不合理而减少了实际收入。河北省许多县小学教员发薪中都有不合理情形：
    一、小米折款低于市价过多：如迁西县四月份教员薪金每斤米按七百七十元折发，而当时市价小米每斤在八百五十元以上，即每斤米少发八十元。抚宁县三月份小米每斤按六百五十元折合，而当时小米市价是每斤八百元左右，即每斤少得一百五十元左右。这样，就使小学教员们全年少得一个月到两个月的薪金。
    二、有些地区，如邯郸县一、二月份是按政务院所规定的财政米价发的款；但到三月份增薪后，又不按此规定执行了。这样，“增薪”就形成了名增实减。如教员牛芳圃二月份薪金一百八十斤米，折款后实得十八万元。三月份他的薪金增为二百一十斤米，但因政府不按财政米价发薪，他实际只拿到十六万八千元。这样，增薪后反比增薪前每月少拿一万二千元。
    三、发坏米。固安、安新、望都、雄县、唐县等地，过去都曾经把坏米发给小学教员，教员提出意见，行政上也不纠正。如固安县发坏米后，工会干部向行政上提出意见，教育科长却说工会向政府闹对立，吓得工会干部不敢作声了。
    四、折发杂粮，不能保证实际工资。唐山专区三月份有的县发了很多小豆，如迁西县六区褚庄完全小学在一千斤米的薪水中，给了一部分小豆，折合率是一斤米折小豆十八两。当时小米每斤价八百元，小豆每斤价六百四十元，算起来一百斤就少得八千元。
    这些不合理的情况，目前有的地方正在纠正（如定县），但有的地方仍未纠正。因此，我们建议有关领导机关深入检查小学教员发薪问题，彻底纠正这些不合理的现象，以保障小学教员的生活，利于小学教育工作的开展。
                                中国教育工会河北省工作委员会
    编者按：本报曾经发表过读者要求解决小学教员的薪资问题的意见，从中国教育工会河北省工作委员会来信中可以看出，到目前为止，这个问题并未在所有地区彻底解决。希望各地人民政府切实检查解决这个问题，因为这是有关小学教育的一件大事。
