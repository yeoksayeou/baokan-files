　　The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee Formulates a Plan to Commemorate "July 1st"
　　Editor's note: The plans of the CCP Shanxi and Hebei Provincial Committees to commemorate July 1st are worthy of reference for other regions. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the great Communist Party of China, Party organizations at all levels should formulate specific plans. Party organizations at all levels should lead various Party propaganda agencies, reporters, and propagandists to carry out enthusiastic propaganda activities both inside and outside the Party, truly forming a mass movement centered on the Party.

　　The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee has determined the plan for commemorating "July 1st," with the main content being:

　　1. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party, Party committees at all levels should conduct propaganda on the history of the Party and Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on the main ideological problems existing inside and outside the Party currently (generally speaking, focusing on three issues: relying on the working class, transforming peasant ideology, and establishing a complete concept of the people's democratic dictatorship).

　　2. From June 15th to before "July 1st," Party committees at all levels above the county level must organize Party members and cadres to study various important articles related to the commemoration of "July 1st" and conduct discussions. During the discussion, it is also necessary to conduct self-criticism in conjunction with the People's Daily editorial—"The Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued," exposing various non-historical materialism viewpoints, as well as political and ideological liberalism. Responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels above the county level should personally lead this discussion and give one or two reports in response to the ideological conditions of the cadres.

　　3. After June 15th, Party committees at all levels above the district level should organize cadres to go deep into a number of factories and rural areas in a focused manner, to conduct propaganda on the history of the Party in Party branches and among the working masses. At the same time, organize and lead Party members (absorbing the masses to participate under the principle of voluntariness) to recall the history of past struggles, examine their understanding of the Party, collect materials on the masses' understanding and opinions of the Party, as well as comparisons before and after liberation. Party committees should report and submit articles to newspapers to gain experience and carry out propaganda widely and effectively before and after "July 1st."

　　4. On July 1st, leading Party organs at all levels, down to each Party branch, should hold appropriate celebration ceremonies. Around "July 1st," each Party branch should hold two Party classes to explain the history of the Party's struggle.

　　5. From July 1st to July 15th, all localities should focus on celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Party, combined with the current central tasks (responding to the three major calls of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, production, cotton purchase, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, etc.), and conduct propaganda inside and outside the Party for half a month. Party committees in various localities may select Party members or Party branches that have made significant achievements in various central tasks in advance, give them appropriate (no exaggeration allowed) praise, and promote their experience. Leading comrades of Party committees at all levels must personally take action in this propaganda work, leading all reporters and propagandists to carry it out in a unified manner. All reporters of provincial-level agencies will be divided into three groups in July to go to counties near the Taiyuan suburbs to give a political report to Party members and the masses in accordance with the above spirit.

　　6. From July 2nd to July 15th, the Provincial Party Committee will organize three lecturer groups to go to counties along the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines to give lectures on Party history to cadres above the district level.

　　7. Supply of propaganda materials: Propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels should organize Party members and cadres to universally purchase and read the 16th issue of the Current Affairs Handbook. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee will compile and distribute the main points of speeches celebrating "July 1st" and simultaneously announce the model deeds of comrades Li Shunda, Liu Hulan, Wang Guiying, Feng Chenying, Guo Baocai, etc. (in both text and comic strip forms), calling on all Party comrades to learn from their model actions.

　　中共山西省委订出纪念“七一”的计划
    编者按：中共山西和河北省委纪念七一的计划，值得各地参考。为了纪念伟大的中国共产党三十周年，党的各级组织都应订出具体计划，各级党的组织应当领导党的各种宣传机构、报告员、宣传员等，在党内外展开热烈的宣传活动，真正形成以党为中心的群众运动。
    中共山西省委确定纪念“七一”计划，主要内容是：
    一、纪念党的三十周年，各级党委应针对当前党内外存在着的主要的思想问题（一般地说，应着重依靠工人阶级、改造农民思想、树立人民民主专政的完整观念等三个问题），来进行关于党的历史与马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的宣传。
    二、六月十五日至“七一”前，县以上各级党委必须组织党员干部学习有关纪念“七一”的各种重要论文，并进行讨论。讨论时还须结合人民日报社论——“应当重视电影武训传的讨论”，展开自我检讨，揭发各种非历史唯物主义的观点，以及政治上、思想上的自由主义。县以上各级党委负责同志，应亲自领导此项讨论，并针对干部思想状况，作一次或二次报告。
    三、六月十五日以后，区以上各级党委，应组织干部有重点地深入若干工厂、农村，在党的支部中和劳动群众中，进行关于党的历史的宣传。同时组织并领导党员（在自愿原则下吸收群众参加），回忆过去斗争历史，检讨对党的认识，搜集群众对党的认识和意见，以及解放前后的对比等材料。党委汇报，一面向报纸投稿，以便取得经验，在“七一”前后广泛地有效地进行宣传。
    四、在七月一日，各级党的领导机关直到每个党的支部，都应举行适当的庆祝仪式。“七一”前后，每个党的支部都要上两次党课，讲解党的斗争历史。
    五、七月一日到七月十五日，各地应以庆祝党的三十周年为中心内容，结合当前中心工作（响应抗美援朝总会三大号召，生产、购棉、镇压反革命等），在党内党外宣传半个月。各地党委事先可选择对于各项中心工作有显著成绩的党员或党的支部，加以适当的（不许夸大）表扬，并推广其经验。此项宣传工作，各级党的领导同志务必亲自动手，领导所有报告员、宣传员，统一地来进行。省级机关所有报告员，七月份分三批到太原郊区附近各县，向党员和群众按照上述精神做一次政治报告。
    六、七月二日到七月十五日，省委组织三个讲师组，分赴正太、同蒲沿线各县，向区以上干部作党史讲演。
    七、供给宣传资料：各级党的宣传部应组织党员干部普遍购阅时事手册第十六期。省委宣传部编发庆祝“七一”讲话要点，同时公布党员李顺达、刘胡兰、王贵英、冯琛瑛、郭宝才等同志的模范事迹（用文字、连环画两种形式），号召全党同志学习他们的模范行动。
