　　Create New Production Achievements to Greet "July 1st"!
　　Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's Third Power Plant Continuously Sets New Records in the Past Twenty Days
　　Workers of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's Third Power Plant are increasing production with great enthusiasm as a gift to commemorate "July 1st." In the past twenty days, they have continuously created many new records and solved the three major difficulties that the plant has never been able to resolve. A certain generator has never been able to carry a full load; this time, after research by the maintenance team and a major overhaul, the output was increased by 50 percent, reaching the nameplate output. During the overhaul of the generator, turner Wang Guilin drilled into the machine at a high temperature of 131 degrees and worked for five full hours, completing the repair two days ahead of schedule. He said, "I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and only by doing this can I live up to the Party's cultivation of me." In the past, Number One pump was always opened only eight notches, and no one dared to open it more; the vibration during operation was too great to solve. After this overhaul, the operating workers tried opening more notches, and as a result, it was opened to forty-eight notches (full open). The machine ran smoothly, increasing efficiency. Also, a certain converter, after overhaul, is now able to run safely. The boiler overhaul was completed two days ahead of schedule, saving a hundred workdays. The rush repair of a certain furnace was completed in two days instead of three. On various quota tasks, the tasks for June were all overfulfilled by around the 22nd, especially with a significant reduction in coal consumption.

　　Shanghai Public Transportation Company Repair Factory Workers Increase Work Efficiency, Building Three More New Buses
　　The 417 workers of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Repair Factory, by increasing production to rush-build three new-type buses (excluding engines), are presenting this as a gift to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the great Chinese Communist Party; the income from overtime production will be donated to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers. On the 21st, the factory workers had already built the third beautiful bus according to their own plan.
　　Based on a precise estimate of the factory's overall productivity, the administration decided to manufacture seven new buses in June. On June 4th, a message spread among the workers: "This year, July 1st is the 30th birthday of the Communist Party!" Everyone immediately proposed: "What shall we workers give as a gift for the Communist Party's 30th birthday?" A heated discussion quickly unfolded. It was unanimously decided: "In addition to completing the task of seven new buses in June, we will increase production by three buses to present to the Communist Party as a gift for its 30th birthday; the overtime pay earned will be used to purchase airplanes and cannons to donate to the Chinese People's Volunteers to defeat the American devils."
　　When the workers raise their fists, they will definitely deliver. In order to complete the task on time, on June 8th, the Communist Party branch secretary, factory director, workshop chairman, and Communist Youth League branch secretary discussed with the workers, and the workers themselves decided to work overtime for one hour every day until the end of the month, and also work overtime on Sundays. Fitters and lathe operators in the metalworking department decided in group meetings: "After completing our own tasks, we will help copper workers with drilling and boring work at any time, and assist paint workers with painting the car body." The most important thing in the work is to improve tools and working methods. The frame requires one-and-a-half-inch thick crossbars, and in the past, four cold workers could only make two and a half pieces a day, which made it more difficult to complete the task. Worker Meng Qingrui, Zhou Huizhang, and fitter Wang Quanlin studied and created a roller bed and press mold, using the press and roller bed at the same time, which increased the efficiency of manufacturing crossbars tenfold. The "eye plates" (used for supporting the frame) on the car body frame were previously made by workers first drawing circles on the steel plate and chiseling holes with a chisel. Now, after making a mold, they are manufactured using a punch press, increasing efficiency two hundredfold. The workers are also currently experimenting with improving the working methods for punching triangular iron plates and pressing one-inch thick car roof frames.
　　"The Communist Party is having a birthday, with three new cars as a gift, expressing our little bit of heart." This is what encourages the workers of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Repair Factory to increase production.

　　Datong Coal Mine Launches Patriotic Labor Emulation Drive
　　Communist Party Member Ma Liuhai Creates New Tunneling Record
　　Workers of all mines and factories in Datong Coal Mine are further launching a patriotic labor emulation drive to greet the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. Ma Liuhai (Communist Party member), a famous labor model of the mine's Third Mine, and the rapid tunneling team he leads, first created a new record of an average tunneling progress of 1.667 meters per worker on the 19th of this month. In order to greet the glorious birthday of the Party, the entire team of workers (ten people) conducted a concrete discussion and study, re-formulated the team's patriotic production increase pledge, guaranteeing to create a new record of tunneling 300 meters in one month from June 5th to July 4th. According to statistics from June 5th to 19th, excluding two days off, the team tunneled a total of 157 meters in thirteen working days, with an average efficiency of 1.21 meters per worker; especially on the 19th, one regular shift (three small shifts) tunneled 18.33 meters, creating a new tunneling record.
　　Driven by the Ma Liuhai team, workers in the mine's First Mine, both underground and above ground, and the machine factory are also launching a red flag emulation drive. Each production team is challenging each other; the Liu Wuzong team is even challenging the Ma Liuhai team. Each team has made red flags, preparing to judge the results after "July 1st" and give the red flag to the winner. The workers even put forward the slogan: "In order to commemorate the birthday of the Communist Party, we must surround the mine entrance with red flags!" Since the Liu Wuzong team put forward the challenge, their production enthusiasm has been extremely high; on the 18th of this month, their tunneling reached 6.5 meters, exceeding the quota by 2.4 meters, more than 170 percent. Many production teams in the mine's Second Mine, No. 6 well, and Third Mine, No. 3 well have also broken quotas one after another. The Zhang Qingfa team exceeded the quota by 15 percent despite the difficulties of a small work surface and frequent machine breakdowns, driving the electromechanical repair workers to also put forward the slogan of "conscientiously repair machinery and reduce accidents." The Zhang Xishan, Liu Shouren and other tunneling teams of the mine's Third Mine have also increased production to greet "July 1st." On the 18th of this month, the Zhang Xishan team tunneled 1.79 meters, exceeding the quota by 123 percent.

　　创造新的生产成绩迎接“七一”！
    天津电业局第三发电厂二十天以来连创新纪录
    天津电业局第三发电厂职工以高度的热情增加生产，作为纪念“七一”的献礼。最近二十天以来，连续创造出不少新纪录。把该厂历来未能解决的三大困难都解决了。某号机历来不能载满负核；这次经过维护班的研究，大检修后提高出力百分之五十，达到名牌出力。在检修该机中，旋工王桂林在一百三十一度的高温度下钻到机器里边，整整工作了五个小时，使该机提前两天修完。他说：“我是青年团员，只有这样做才不辜负共产党对我的培养。”一号泵过去老是开八扣，谁也不敢多开；运行震动太大，无法解决。经过这次的检修，运行工人试着多开扣数，结果开到四十八扣（满扣）。机器平稳运行，提高了效力。还有某号变流机，经过检修，已能安全运行。检修锅炉提前两天修完，节省了一百个工。抢修某号炉，三天的活两天做完了。在各种定额任务上，六月份的任务至二十二日左右已全部超额完成，尤其是煤耗，有显著的降低。

  上海公共交通公司修造厂工人提高工作效率多造三辆新汽车
    上海公共交通公司修造厂四百十七位工友，以增产赶造最新型公共汽车三辆（引擎除外），作为向伟大的中国共产党三十周年纪念的献礼；加班增产的收入，献购飞机大炮，支援英勇的中国人民志愿军。二十一日，该厂工友已按自己订的计划，造好了第三辆漂亮的汽车。
    根据全厂生产力的精密估计，行政上决定在六月份制造新车七辆。六月四日，工友间传开来一个消息：“今年七月一日，是共产党三十岁生日啦！”大家立刻提出：“共产党三十岁生日，我们工人用啥送礼呢？”即热烈的讨论很快展开。一致决定：“六月份内除完成七辆新车任务外，增产三辆，献给共产党作为三十岁生日的献礼；增产所得加班费，购买飞机大炮，献给中国人民志愿军，打垮美国鬼子。”
    工友们的拳头举起来就一定兑现。为了按时完成任务，六月八日，中国共产党支部书记、厂长、车间主席、青年团支部书记就和工友们讨论，工友们自己决定到月底每天加班一小时，星期天也加班。金工部钳工、车工在小组会上决定：“在自己的任务完成后，随时帮助铜工做打眼钻洞工作，协助漆工做车身喷漆工作”。工作中最重要的是改进工具，改进工作方法。车架需要一分半厚的横档，以前四个冷作工一天只能打出二根半，这使任务完成增加了困难。工务员孟庆瑞、周惠章和钳工王全林研究创造辊床和压床模子，把压床与辊床同时使用，使制造横档效率提高十倍。车身架上用的“眼睛板”（支衬骨架用的）过去工友们先在钢板上划好圈，用凿子凿眼，现在做好模子后利用冲床制造，提高效率二百倍。现工友们还正在试验改进冲三角铁板及压一分厚车顶骨架等的工作方法。
    “共产党，做生日，三辆新车作献礼，表表我们一点心。”这就是鼓励上海公共交通公司修造厂工友加劲生产的原因。

  大同煤矿开展爱国劳动大竞赛
  共产党员马六孩创掘进新纪录
    大同煤矿各矿厂职工，正在进一步开展爱国劳动大竞赛，来迎接中国共产党三十周年纪念日。该矿第三矿著名劳动模范马六孩（共产党员）和他所领导的快速掘进组，于本月十九日，首先创造了每工平均掘进一公尺六十六公分七的新纪录。为了迎接光荣的党的生日，该组全体工人（十人）经过了具体地讨论研究，重新制定了全组的增产爱国公约，保证从六月五日起到七月四日止一个月中，创掘进三百米的新纪录。根据六月五日到十九日的统计，除了两个公休日外，在十三个工作日里，全组共掘进一百五十七米，每工平均效率为一公尺二十一公分；特别在十九日那天，一个原班（三小班）就掘进了十八米三十三公分，创造了掘进新纪录。
    在马六孩小组的带动下，该矿一矿井下、井上和机分厂的工人，也正在展开红旗竞赛。各生产小组都互相挑战；刘五宗小组并向马六孩小组挑战。各小组都作了红旗，准备在“七一”以后评判成绩，谁优胜就把红旗送给谁。工人们更提出口号：“为了纪念共产党的生日，一定要拿红旗把井口围满了！”刘五宗小组自提出挑战后，生产情绪极高；本月十八号，掘进竟达六公尺五，超过定额二公尺四的百分之一百七十多。该矿二矿六号井、三号井不少生产小组，也接二连三地突破定额。张清发小组在工作面小和机器常发生毛病的困难条件下，还超过了定额百分之十五，带动了机电检修工也提出“认真检修机械，减少事故”的口号。该矿三矿张喜山、刘守仁等掘进小组，也纷纷以超额生产迎接“七一”。本月十八日，张喜山小组掘进了一公尺七十九公分，超过了定额百分之一百二十三。
