　　Relief Association and Red Cross Society of China
    Launch Campaign to Donate Ambulances
    [Our Newspaper] The China Relief Association and the Red Cross Society of China issued a call on the 11th to all relief and welfare organizations, institutions, individuals engaged in relief and welfare work, and all members of the Red Cross Society of China, suggesting that a campaign to donate ambulances be launched immediately in the national relief and welfare sector. The call stated: The Chinese People's Volunteers are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. In order to defend the security of the motherland and safeguard world peace, they charge into battle regardless of enemy planes and artillery. Many soldiers, despite being seriously wounded, are unwilling to leave the front lines. Providing emergency medical care to these heroic defenders of the country is our bounden duty. We firmly believe that this suggestion will be warmly supported by the vast number of patriotic compatriots, and that patriotic compatriots in the national relief and welfare sector will continue to promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, take immediate action, and jointly complete this sacred task as soon as possible.
    The two associations also issued methods for donating ambulances. The China Relief Association has notified its local branches to promptly promote this work.
