　　Xi'an City Holds Sentencing Rally
　　Categorically Deals with Counter-Revolutionary Criminals
　　Based on the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Xi'an City People's Court sentenced a group of counter-revolutionary criminals prosecuted by the City People's Procuratorate according to the severity of their crimes. Those sentenced to death, with the approval of the Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, were executed by shooting after a sentencing rally held on the 12th. Over 50,000 representatives from various ethnic groups, democratic parties, people's organizations, government organs, and schools attended the rally. At the same time, more than 230,000 people in Xi'an City and nearby counties and cities listened to a live broadcast of the rally.
　　The counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced were divided into five categories: First, 122 arch-criminal counter-revolutionaries, including He Shousun and Li Zhiting, were sentenced to death and executed immediately; Second, 21 counter-revolutionary criminals, including Shi Kaiming and Qi Jiefu, were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to observe their future behavior; Third, 11 counter-revolutionary criminals, including Fan Yangshan, were sentenced to life imprisonment; Fourth, 166 counter-revolutionary criminals, including Zhang Shimin and Tang Yongshun, were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment; Fifth, 104 counter-revolutionary criminals, including Hu Yingjie and Gao Chengji, were released on bail under supervision. At the rally, Zhao Boping, the chairman of the rally, pointed out in his speech that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a matter for all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people of all ethnic groups. It is something that the People's Government and the broad masses of the people can only do well through full cooperation. Cheng Boren, a representative of the China Democratic League who participated in the work of clearing counter-revolutionary cases, and Chen Yugao, a representative of democratic figures, stated in their speeches that all democratic classes and democratic parties firmly support the People's Government's judgment of this group of counter-revolutionaries. Those who should be killed are killed, those who should be imprisoned are imprisoned, and those who should be released are released, fully embodying the policy of combining suppression with leniency. Finally, Ren Fuzhong, the president of the City People's Court, read out the judgment. Those who were to be killed were immediately escorted to the execution ground and shot, those who were to be imprisoned were immediately escorted back to prison, and those who were to be released were released on the spot.
　　After the sentencing, many citizens wrote letters to the presidium of the rally expressing their support for the government's just judgment. Factories, schools, government organs, and the masses in Changwu, Fengxiang, Binxian and other counties hundreds of miles away also made long-distance calls to the presidium of the rally, expressing their firm support for the People's Government's righteous judgment of eliminating harm for the people and paying tribute to the public security personnel of the People's Government.
　　Before the judgment by the City People's Court, more than 1,600 members of the Xi'an City and district-level committees for clearing counter-revolutionary cases assisted the City People's Procuratorate in collecting and analyzing the evidence of the crimes of these counter-revolutionaries and put forward preliminary opinions on how to handle them. They conducted in-depth investigations among the masses, solicited the opinions of the people, collected and verified the evidence of the crimes of each counter-revolutionary criminal, and held meetings to discuss specific handling methods. After a series of thorough investigations and repeated discussions, the City People's Procuratorate finally filed a public prosecution with the City People's Court regarding all the evidence of the crimes of all the criminals and the opinions on how to handle them.

    判决的反革命罪犯分五类：一、判处死刑立即执行的有反革命首恶分子何受荪、李芝亭等一百二十二名；二、判处死刑，缓期二年，强迫劳动，以观后效的有反革命罪犯史开明、祁介夫等二十一名；三、判处无期徒刑的有反革命罪犯樊仰山等十一名；四、判处不同刑期徒刑的有反革命罪犯张师民、唐永顺等一百六十六名；五、判决取保释放后予以管制的有反革命罪犯胡英杰、郜承级等一百零四名。会上，大会主席赵伯平在讲话中指出：镇压反革命运动，是各民主阶级、各民主党派及各民族各界人民大家的事，是人民政府和广大人民全力合作才能做好的事。参加清理反革命案件工作的中国民主同盟代表成柏仁、民主人士代表陈雨皋等在讲话中说明：各民主阶级，各民主党派，坚决拥护人民政府对于这批反革命分子的判决，该杀的杀，该关的关，该放的放，完全体现了镇压与宽大相结合的政策。最后市人民法院院长任扶中宣读判决书，该杀的立即押送刑场执行枪决，该关的立即押回监狱，该放的当场释放。

    在市人民法院判决前，西安市市、区两级清理反革命案件委员会的一千六百多委员，曾分别协助市人民检察署搜集、分析这批反革命分子的罪证，并提出初步处理意见。他们深入群众调查，征询人民群众的意见，收集和审核各反革命罪犯的罪证，并开会讨论具体处理办法。经过一系列的缜密调查，反复讨论，最后才由市人民检察机关将一切罪犯的罪证以及处理意见向市人民法院提起公诉。
