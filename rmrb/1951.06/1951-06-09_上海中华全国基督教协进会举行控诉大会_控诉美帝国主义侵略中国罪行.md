　　The Shanghai National Christian Council of China Holds Accusation Meeting to Denounce US Imperialist Crimes of Aggression Against China

　　The National Christian Council of China (hereinafter referred to as the Council) held an accusation meeting in Shanghai on the 1st of this month to expose the crimes of US imperialism in using Christianity to invade China. More than 1,200 people attended the meeting, including all staff members of the Council and representatives from various Christian organizations and churches in Shanghai.

　　Those who made accusations at the meeting included Wu Gaozi, President of the Council, Cui Xianxiang, Vice President, Chen Jianzhen, Executive Committee Member, Lin Yongyu, Secretary, and Miao Qiusheng, former Chairman of the Council's Executive Committee.

　　Cui Xianxiang, who has worked in the Council for more than 20 years, first accused US imperialism of using the Council to invade China, based on what he had personally witnessed. He said, "The Council was planned and established by the famous American Christian leader, Mott. American missionaries controlled all major powers of the Council, including finance, personnel, and work plans, using the Council to investigate our country's political, economic, and social situation, with a large number of investigation and statistical materials sent to Mott every year." He further revealed that the Council's "Investigation and Occupation Special Committee" was an intelligence agency. The head of the committee, Stauffer, had been conducting a large-scale comprehensive investigation since 1916. The investigation was funded by the American capitalist Rockefeller and covered 19 provinces in our country. The committee mobilized more than 5,000 foreign missionaries in its investigation work and colluded with local feudal warlords. The result of the investigation was the investigation report entitled "The Christian Occupation of China," completed in 1922. Next, he accused US imperialism of using the Council to undermine the Chinese people's revolutionary movement and colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out anti-communist and anti-people conspiracies. He said that during the May 30th Movement in 1925, the American capitalist Rockefeller provided the Council's Labor Department with US$75,000 as funding for "preaching" to factory workers to paralyze the rising revolutionary sentiments of the Chinese working class. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, US imperialism, through its running dog, Chen Wenyuan, the former General Secretary of the Council, colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to organize the so-called "Military Life Counseling Corps" to train reactionary troops for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to oppose communism and the people. In 1947, the US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, openly instructed Liang Xiaochu, the then President of the Council, and others to form a Nanjing delegation to express support for the puppet National Government and endorse Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "General Mobilization Order" to carry out the anti-people civil war. These are historical evidences of US imperialism using the Council to carry out aggression.

　　Miao Qiusheng exposed the US imperialist attempt to use the Council to undermine the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of Chinese Christianity and reviewed his own mistake of being used by US imperialism to participate in this conspiracy. In October 1950, when the Council held its 14th annual meeting (when the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement had already begun across the country), Heyward (British), a former Council secretary and imperialist element, instructed Miao Qiusheng to exclude the discussion of the Three-Self Patriotic Reform issue from the agenda of the annual meeting and attempted to issue a declaration opposing the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement in the name of the meeting. At the same time, Huang Ansu, an American imperialist element lurking in the Methodist Church, used the Council's old charter as an excuse to send four American missionaries to participate in the annual meeting in an attempt to control the discussion of the annual meeting. Miao Qiusheng did not reject these destructive conspiracies at the time, and it was only under the firm opposition of the majority of patriotic representatives at the annual meeting that they were not realized. He said painfully at the accusation meeting, "I was used by imperialism, and now I express my determination to completely sever relations with imperialism. Today's accusation is the beginning of this determination in action."

　　Wu Gaozi revealed in his accusation the new conspiracy of US imperialism to use Christianity to invade China. He said that in October 1948, when the Chinese People's Revolutionary War was about to achieve its final victory, the North American Missionary Association formulated a "Five-Year Plan for Christian Affairs in China." This plan stipulated that in the five years from 1949 to 1953, 2,000 new missionaries would be sent to China, and their work scope and tasks were specified in detail.

　　Chen Jianzhen accused US imperialism of using the Council to spread ideological poisons and commit cultural aggression. He said that under the control of US imperialism, the Council had spread many reactionary remarks. For example, in the 12th issue of the 2nd volume of the "Tian Feng" weekly, Bi Fanyu published an article entitled "Challenge," openly slandering the Soviet Union and the Communist Party and using atomic bombs to threaten the masses of believers. It had numbed and poisoned many believers.

　　Finally, Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement Committee of Chinese Christianity Against US Aggression and Aid Korea, made a summary. He said that the accusations of the five comrades have made everyone further realize that US imperialism's use of Christianity to invade China is long-term, planned, step-by-step, and all-pervasive. Whether Chinese Christianity can be reborn depends on whether it can eliminate the aggressive influence of US imperialism. He called on all Christians in China to bravely stand up and make accusations and fight for the bright future of Christianity!

### 上海中华全国基督教协进会举行控诉大会  控诉美帝国主义侵略中国罪行

　　上海中华全国基督教协进会举行控诉大会
    控诉美帝国主义侵略中国罪行
    中华全国基督教协进会（以下简称协进会）于本月一日在上海举行控诉大会，揭露美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国的罪行。参加大会的有协进会全体工作人员和上海市各基督教团体及教堂的代表，共一千二百多人。
    在会上进行控诉的，有协进会会长吴高梓、副会长崔宪详、执行委员陈见真、干事林永俣及前协进会会务委员会主席缪秋笙等五人。
    在协进会工作已达二十多年的崔宪详，首先将他亲眼看见的美帝国主义利用协进会侵略中国的罪行提出控诉。他说：“协进会这个组织，就是著名的美国基督教头子穆德一手策划组成的。美籍传教士掌握了协进会的经济、人事、事工计划等一切大权，利用协进会调查我国的政治、经济与社会情况，每年都有大批的调查统计材料送达穆德。”他进而揭露协进会的“调查与占领特别委员会”就是一个情报机构。该委员会负责人施德敷从一九一六年起进行了一个规模巨大的全面调查工作。调查费用由美国资本家洛克斐勒供给，调查的范围包括我国十九个省份。该委员会在调查工作中动员了外籍传教士五千多人，并与当地封建军阀相勾结。调查的结果便是在一九二二年完成的题名《基督教占领中国》的调查报告。接着，他又控诉美帝国主义利用协进会破坏中国人民革命运动，勾结蒋匪帮进行反共反人民的阴谋活动。他说：在一九二五年五卅运动时，美国大资本家洛克斐勒曾特别以七万五千元美金供给协进会劳工部，作为向工厂工人“布道”的经费，以麻痹当时中国工人阶级高涨的革命情绪。抗战时期，美帝国主义又通过他的走狗、前协进会总干事陈文渊，勾结蒋匪帮组织所谓“军事生活辅导团”，为蒋匪帮训练反共反人民的反动军队。一九四七年，美国驻华大使司徒雷登又公开指使当时协进会会长梁小初等组成南京访问团，表示支持伪国民政府以及拥护蒋匪所发布的进行反人民内战的所谓“总动员令”。这些都是美帝国主义利用协进会进行侵略的历史罪证。
    缪秋笙揭露了美帝国主义企图利用协进会破坏中国基督教三自革新运动的阴谋，并检讨了他自己曾被美帝国主义利用，参加了这一阴谋活动的错误。一九五零年十月，协进会举行第十四届年会时（当时三自革新运动已在全国展开），前任协进会干事、帝国主义分子海维德（英籍）曾指使缪秋笙在年会程序中排除讨论三自革新问题的议程，并企图通过缪秋笙以会议名义发表一项反对三自革新运动的宣言。同时，潜伏在基督教卫理公会内的美帝国主义分子黄安素，以协进会的旧宪章为借口，派遣美籍教士四人参加年会，企图控制年会的讨论，缪秋笙当时对于这些破坏阴谋并未拒绝，只是在年会中多数爱国代表的坚决反对下，才没有实现。他在控诉会上沉痛地说：“我受了帝国主义的利用，现在我表示要完全与帝国主义断绝关系。今天的控诉，就是这个决心在行动上的开始。”
    吴高梓在控诉中揭露了美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国的新阴谋。他说：就在一九四八年十月，中国人民革命战争即将取得最后胜利的时候，北美差会联合会拟订了一个“中国基督教事业五年计划”。这个计划规定在一九四九年到一九五三年的五年中，增派新教士二千人到中国来，并且详细规定了他们的工作范围和工作任务。
    陈见真控诉美帝国主义利用协进会散布思想毒素的文化侵略罪行。他说：协进会在美帝国主义操纵下曾散布了很多反动的言论。例如在二卷十二期《天风》周刊上，毕范宇曾发表了一篇题为《挑战》的文章，公开污蔑苏联，污蔑共产党，并用原子弹威吓教徒群众。曾经麻痹、毒害了不少教徒。
    大会最后由中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹委会主席吴耀宗作总结。他说：五位同工的控诉，使大家进一步认清了美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国是长期的，有计划有步骤的，无孔不入的。中国基督教能否新生，就要看她能否肃清美帝国主义的侵略影响。他号召全中国的基督教徒们都要勇敢地起来控诉，为基督教的光明前途而斗争！
