    Wanbei State-owned Grain Company and Cooperatives Timely Supply and Sell Grain to Meet Farmers' Urgent Needs
    The Wanbei Grain Company and cooperatives promptly supplied and sold a large quantity of grain to meet the needs of farmers during the lean season. The Linhuaiguan Office of the Wanbei Grain Company sold over 2 million jin of coarse and fine grains from May 1st to 20th, stabilizing grain prices during the lean season. Cooperatives in Jiangpu and other areas of Wanbei not only supplied members with grain and rice seeds at prices 40 to 50 yuan per jin lower than the market price, but also purchased sideline products such as reed mats from members, linking the supply and purchase operations together to solve their grain needs with their own products.
