　　Tenth District of Beijing Suburbs
    Donates "Beijing Eastern Suburbs People's" Airplane

    The Tenth District of Beijing Suburbs convened a People's Representatives Conference on the 8th, and the conference passed a resolution to donate an airplane named "Beijing Eastern Suburbs People's." Prior to this, people from all walks of life in the district had already been actively donating. Some farmers have already set out production increase plans, preparing to donate a portion of their increased income. Many farmers proposed savings and enthusiastically donated, saying, "Ten thousand from you, ten thousand from me, piled together, it becomes a mountain." Before the 7th, four villages, including Guandongdian in the district, had already donated 4.52 million yuan. The 48 staff members of the district government also donated more than 800,000 yuan in cash. Furthermore, the Farmers' Association Committee of Shuanghuaishu Village in the western suburbs of Beijing also discussed donation methods, deciding to mobilize all the village's farmers to donate 8,000 to 10,000 jin of millet. At the same time, they called on farmers to do a good job in seed selection, summer hoeing, applying topdressing fertilizer, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, as well as increasing sideline production, and strive to overfulfill the production increase task this autumn, and dedicate a portion of the increased production. Cheng Xuexin, a labor model in the village, and others have already set out specific production increase methods. (Ai Ding, Song Yunfeng, Wang Zhenzhong, Shi Yan)

　　北京市郊第十区        
    捐“北京东郊人民号”飞机
    北京市郊第十区在八日召开了各界人民代表会议，会议通过捐献“北京东郊人民号”飞机一架。该区各界人民在此以前就已纷纷自动捐献。有的农民已订出了增产计划，准备捐献增产收入的一部分。许多农民提出节约，踊跃捐献，他们说：“你一万，我一万，集中起来堆成山”。七日以前，该区关东店等四个村就已捐献了四百五十二万元。该区区政府工作人员四十八人也捐献了现金八十多万元。又，北京西郊双槐树村农民协会委员会也讨论了捐献办法，决定发动全村农民捐献小米八千斤到一万斤，同时号召农民作好选种、夏锄、施追肥、防治病虫害等工作，并增加副业生产，争取今秋超额完成增产任务，献出增产的一部分。该村劳动模范程学信等已首先订出了具体的增产办法。（艾丁、宋云峰、王振忠、石岩）
