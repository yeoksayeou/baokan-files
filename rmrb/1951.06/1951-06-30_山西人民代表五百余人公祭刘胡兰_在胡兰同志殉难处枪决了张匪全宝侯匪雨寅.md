More Than 500 People's Representatives from Shanxi Province Publicly Commemorate Liu Hulan
　　Zhang Quanbao and Hou Yuyin, Bandits, Executed by Firing Squad at the Site of Comrade Hulan's Martyrdom

　　Five hundred representatives from all walks of life in Shanxi Province held a public memorial service at the tomb of Martyr Liu Hulan in Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, on June 24. Representatives from more than 60 units, including the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations in Shanxi Province, the Yucheng Local Committee of the CPC, the Yucheng People's Administrative Commissioner's Office, and various levels of organs and groups in Wenshui and Qi County, attended the public memorial service. During the public memorial service, Wang Yan, secretary of the Fifth District Committee of the CPC in Wenshui County, announced the decision of the former Jin-Sui Branch Bureau of the CPC to posthumously recognize Liu Hulan as a formal party member, stating: Comrade Liu Hulan joined the Communist Party of China in September 1946, at the age of fourteen, as a probationary party member. After joining the party, she was loyal and brave, and shed her last drop of blood for the cause of the party and the people. She was unyielding in the face of the enemy, demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. After Comrade Liu Hulan's sacrifice on January 12, 1947, the former Jin-Sui Branch Bureau of the CPC posthumously recognized her as a formal member of the CPC. After the public memorial service, the Wenshui County Committee of the CPC presented a red plaque inscribed with "Home of Liu Hulan, Outstanding Member of the Communist Party of China" to the heroine's family.

　　On the same day, more than 20,000 people from all walks of life in Wenshui County publicly tried Zhang Quanbao and Hou Yuyin, the bandits who murdered Liu Hulan, in Yunzhou West Village, the county.

　　Both bandits were special agents of the "National Revolutionary Comrades Association," a secret agent organization of the Yan Xishan bandits. Zhang was the "instructor of the machine gun company of the first battalion of the 215th regiment of the 72nd division" of the Yan bandit army in 1946, and Hou was the "deputy battalion commander of the first battalion of the 215th regiment of the 72nd division" of the Yan bandit army. On January 12, 1947, Hou conspired with Zhang Quanbao and Xu Desheng (then the "company commander" of the Yan bandit army) to murder Liu Hulan. Zhang and Xu jointly led the bandit army to surround Yunzhou West Village and used guillotines to kill Liu Hulan and six farmers. After the liberation of Wenshui, Zhang and others fled elsewhere. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they were successively captured and brought to justice by the people's public security organs (the bandit Xu Desheng had already been executed in Qi County).

　　After Zhang and Hou were captured, the people of Yunzhou West Village in Wenshui County immediately requested the People's Government to escort the two bandits to the village for a public trial. Letters from people all over the country demanding severe punishment for Zhang and Hou also poured into the Shanxi Provincial People's Government like snowflakes.

　　The People's Government accepted the demands of the broad masses of the people and escorted Zhang and Hou to the site of the massacre for a public trial. When the news of the public trial of the two bandits spread, more than 20,000 people came to attend the public trial, crowding the square next to the South Temple in Yunzhou West Village—the place where Liu Hulan was killed. When Zhang and Hou were brought before the court at the beginning of the public trial, thousands of angry eyes stared at the heinous murderers, and shouts of "Avenge Liu Hulan" resounded through the clouds. The two bandits were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they trembled.

　　Liu Zhiqin, the representative of the Wenshui County Committee of the CPC, first filed a complaint, saying: "Five years ago, the bandits killed Liu Hulan, an outstanding member of our party, here. This is an irreparable loss to the Communist Party and the people. On behalf of all the Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the county, I demand that these two bandits be sentenced to death." Hu Wenxiu, Liu Hulan's mother, stepped onto the accusation platform, pointed at Zhang Quanbao's head, and said with grief and force: "Five years ago, you killed my daughter, you heinous bastard! Today, I demand revenge for the good daughter of the Chinese people!" The families of the six farmers who were killed also filed complaints one after another, unanimously demanding severe punishment for the counter-revolutionaries and consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　During the accusation, the slogans of more than 20,000 people demanding revenge for the martyrs such as Liu Hulan rose one after another. When the presiding judge announced the verdict, the entire venue cheered and applauded for a long time. After the two bandits were executed and fell to the ground, many people kept spitting at the bandits' corpses, saying: "Bah! This is really letting these heinous dogs off easy!"

　　山西人民代表五百余人公祭刘胡兰
    在胡兰同志殉难处枪决了张匪全宝侯匪雨寅
    山西省各界人民代表五百余人于六月二十四日在文水县云周西村刘胡兰烈士墓前举行公祭。参加公祭的有中国共产党山西省委员会、山西省人民政府、中国人民解放军某部、山西省各人民团体、中共榆次地方委员会、榆次人民行政专员公署、以及文水县、祁县各级机关、团体等六十多个单位的代表。公祭时，中共文水县第五区委员会书记王彦宣布原中共晋绥分局关于追认刘胡兰为正式党员的决定称：刘胡兰同志在一九四六年九月参加了中国共产党，当年十四岁，为党的候补党员，她入党后，忠诚勇敢，为党和人民的事业流尽了自己最后的一滴血。她在敌人面前坚贞不屈，表现了共产党员的高贵品质。一九四七年一月十二日刘胡兰同志牺牲后，原中共晋绥分局即追认她为中共正式党员。公祭毕，中共文水县委员会并将题着“中国共产党优秀党员刘胡兰之家”的红匾一面，献给女英雄的家庭。
    同一天，文水县各界人民两万余人在该县云周西村公审杀害刘胡兰的凶手张匪全宝和侯匪雨寅。
    两匪都是阎匪特务组织“民族革命同志会”的特务分子。张匪于一九四六年任阎匪军“七十二师二一五团一营机枪连指导员”，侯匪曾任阎匪军“七十二师二一五团一营副营长”。一九四七年一月十二日，侯匪与张全宝、徐得胜（当时任阎匪军“连长”）等同谋杀害刘胡兰，由张、徐两匪共同率领匪军包围云周西村，将刘胡兰和六个农民用铡刀铡死。文水解放后，张匪等都潜逃他处，在镇压反革命运动中，先后被人民公安机关捕获归案（徐匪得胜已先在祁县伏法）。
    当张、侯两匪落网后，文水县云周西村人民群众即要求人民政府将两匪押赴该村公审。全国各地人民要求严惩张、侯两匪的书信，也如雪片般地寄到山西省人民政府。
    人民政府接受了广大人民要求，将张、侯两匪押至惨案发生地点举行公审。当公审两匪的消息传出后，前来参加公审大会的有两万多人，挤满了云周西村南庙旁广场——原刘胡兰遇难的地方。公审开始，当张、侯两匪押到法庭前时，千万双愤怒的眼睛望着万恶的凶手，“为刘胡兰报仇”的喊声响彻云霄。两匪吓得面如土色，抖成一团。
    中共文水县委员会代表刘芝青首先提起控诉说：“五年前匪徒就在这里杀死了我党的优秀党员刘胡兰，这是共产党和人民不可弥补的损失。我代表全县共产党员和青年团员，要求把这两个匪徒处以极刑。”刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀走上控诉台，指着张匪全宝的头，悲愤而有力地说：“五年前，你杀死我的女儿，你这万恶的坏蛋！今天，我要求给中国人民的好女儿报仇！”被杀害的六位农民的家属也相继进行了控诉，一致要求严惩反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政。
    控诉进行中，两万多人要求为刘胡兰等烈士报仇的口号声彼伏此起。当审判长宣读判决书后，全场欢声雷动，掌声经久不息。两匪伏法倒地后，很多人还不断地向匪徒死尸吐着唾沫说：“呸！真便宜了这万恶的狗仔！”
