　　Engineering Geological Surveys Should Precede Large-Scale Construction Projects

　　One of the main errors in the construction of the Northeast Third Paper Mill was the lack of a serious engineering geological survey. This is a serious mistake in construction engineering, and it exists in the basic engineering design work of many projects across the country. For example, in a certain large dam project, the dam type could not be determined due to the failure to investigate the geology of the dam site in time. In a certain large bridge project, the determination of the bridge truss type was affected by the failure to scientifically grasp the geological conditions of the bridge site. In a certain large factory, the performance of the soil at the factory site was not understood before the factory was built, resulting in foundation settlement after the factory was built. Therefore, the completed buildings had to be demolished and foundation consolidation work was carried out. A certain river management project did not conduct an engineering geological survey before construction. After construction, it was discovered that the estimated earthwork volume did not match the actual volume, so work had to be stopped and new excavation tools had to be planned. A certain factory did not conduct a water source geological survey, and drilled a well for more than a year in a water-poor stratum, which ultimately failed. Because the investigation and research work on landslide geology in a certain section of the railway was not carried out on a large scale, the landslide problem could not be solved early, which affected the smooth flow of traffic. These facts, although only a part of the examples we know, are enough to illustrate the importance and indispensability of engineering geological surveys in engineering design.

　　The phenomenon of neglecting engineering geological surveys must be overcome. The phenomenon of waste existing in individual construction projects during engineering geological surveys should also be improved. At present, major construction sites are carrying out foundation drilling projects (using drilling rigs to drill into the ground at the site of the proposed project to explore the distribution of foundation soil and rock, to determine the quality of the geology, and to calculate the bearing capacity of the foundation). Each meter of depth costs 300 to 1,000 jin of millet. For the most common 30-meter-deep drill hole, each hole requires 9,000 to 30,000 jin of millet. At present, foundation drilling work is mostly presided over by various engineering institutions. The purpose of foundation drilling is often not thoroughly understood, so the location, depth, and number of drill holes are often not suitable for geological requirements. The registration, identification, and preservation of the drilled soil samples and rock cores are also not given enough attention, so that the foundation drilling work, which took a lot of time and money, still cannot provide the required accurate data. As far as I know, in several foundation drilling projects currently, more than one hundred such drill holes with little use have been made. This is indeed a significant waste! It is hoped that relevant departments will inspect and correct the foundation drilling projects they are in charge of. If we do not do a good job in foundation drilling when we carry out engineering design, the design work will be difficult to be accurate. As for those who blindly start construction before conducting engineering geological surveys, the losses caused by such errors will inevitably be even more serious.

### 进行大规模的修建工程之前  应先勘察工程地质

　　进行大规模的修建工程之前
    应先勘察工程地质
    国营东北第三造纸厂工程中的错误的主要内容之一，就是对工程地质没有认真进行勘察，这是建筑工程中一个严重的错误，这个错误在全国许多工程的基础工程设计工作中都存在着。如某大水坝工程，因未能及时调查坝基地质，致水坝型式未能决定。某大桥梁工程，未能科学地掌握桥基地质情况，致影响大桥桁式的决定。某大工厂在建厂前，对厂基土壤的性能未加了解，致建厂后发生地基沉陷现象，遂不得不拆去已做好的建筑物，施以巩固地基的工程。某治河工程在施工前未作工程地质勘察，在施工后发觉所估计的土石方与实际不符，只有停工另筹开挖工具。某厂未做水源地质勘察，在一个贫水的地层中凿了一年多的井，终归失败。某段铁路因坍方地质的调查研究工作未能大规模的展开，致坍方问题未能早日解决，影响交通不能畅行。这些事实，虽然只是我们所知道的一部分实例；但是这足以说明工程地质勘察在工程设计中的重要和不可忽视。
    轻视工程地质勘察的现象，必须克服。个别的建筑工程中在进行工程地质勘察时存在着的浪费现象也应该注意改进。现在各大建设工区，都在进行着地基钻探工程（用钻机在拟建工程的地点向地下钻入，以探验地基土质和石质的分布情形，来确定地质的优劣，据以计算地基的承重力），这种地基钻探每进行一公尺的深度，要付出三百斤至一千斤小米的代价，以最普通三十公尺深的钻眼来说，每眼需九千斤至三万斤小米。现各处地基钻探工作多由各工程机构自己主持，对于地基钻探的目的多未彻底明了，致所定钻眼的位置、深度和数目多不适合地质要求，对于钻出的土样和岩心的登记、鉴定和保存工作也不够重视，以致辛辛苦苦花了许多时间和金钱来进行的地基钻探工作，结果仍不能供给所需要的精确资料。据我所知，目前几处地基钻探工程中，像这样用处很少的钻眼，已超过了一百眼以上。这实在是一笔重大的浪费！希望有关部门对自己所主持的地基钻探工程，加以检查和改正。在我们进行工程设计时如不把地基钻探工作搞好，设计工作就很难精确。至于那些没有进行工程地质勘察以前就盲目施工的，那种错误所造成的损失，就必然更加严重了。
