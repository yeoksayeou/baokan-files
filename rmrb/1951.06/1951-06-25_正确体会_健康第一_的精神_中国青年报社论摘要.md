Correctly Understand the Spirit of "Health First"
    --Abstract of China Youth Daily Editorial
    The China Youth Daily published a commentary on the 19th entitled "Correctly Understanding the Spirit of 'Health First.'" This commentary criticizes some people's incorrect understanding of the slogan "Health First." The commentary first states that since the slogan "Health First" was put forward, schools in various places have generally attached importance to the issue of improving students' health. Some schools have done some work in streamlining courses, improving food, and carrying out recreational and sports activities. The students' health has improved significantly, but some schools have not achieved the expected results because they have not well understood the spirit of "Health First." The commentary then points out that some schools regard "Health First" as the current guiding principle of school education, which is incorrect. Because at present, schools should implement the New Democratic education policy, and the goal of New Democratic education is to cultivate young people to become conscious and active members of defending and building a New Democratic country and all-round development talents. Since liberation, the political consciousness and teaching enthusiasm of teachers and students have been greatly improved. Everyone is rushing to catch up with their studies and busy with their work. They have not paid due attention to the poor health caused by the past reactionary rule. Therefore, the slogan "Health First" is put forward. This is completely in line with the current situation and requirements. But if we one-sidedly believe that "Health First" is the current guiding principle of school education, it will blur the goal of school education.
    The commentary further points out that some students put "health" in opposition to "learning" and "work," thinking that "Health First" means "don't study," or that "Health First, eat more, play more, and rest more." Obviously, this view distorts the meaning of "Health First" and fails to recognize the purpose of "Health First." It should be recognized that good health is important. Only with a healthy body can we learn better and work better. However, building a healthy body is by no means our ultimate goal. We do not want to cultivate mediocre talents who are "healthy but simple-minded," but to cultivate construction cadres who are hardworking, healthy, proficient in technology, and have a high degree of political awareness, to engage in strengthening the country's economic and defense capabilities, to crush the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, and to open up our prosperous and happy future. Therefore, only by closely integrating "Health First" with the task of New Democratic education can this slogan have rich ideological content.
    The commentary finally points out that some schools believe that improving students' health can only be done through sports activities. This understanding is incomplete. Improving students' health should start from rationally streamlining courses, reducing unnecessary meeting activities, improving environmental sanitation, improving food, and cultivating students' correct living habits.

### 正确体会“健康第一”的精神  ——中国青年报社论摘要

　　正确体会“健康第一”的精神
    ——中国青年报社论摘要
    中国青年报十九日发表题为《正确体会“健康第一”的精神》的评论。这一评论批判了一些人对“健康第一”这一口号的不正确的认识。评论首先说明：自从“健康第一”这一口号提出后，各地学校普遍地重视了增进学生健康的问题。有些学校在精简课程、改善伙食、开展文娱和体育活动等方面作了一些工作。学生健康情况有了显著的改善，但有些学校因为没有很好地体会“健康第一”的精神，虽然也注意了学生的健康，却没有收到预期的效果。评论继指出：有些学校把“健康第一”认为是目前学校教育的方针，这种看法是不正确的。因为目前学校应该贯彻新民主主义的教育方针，新民主主义教育的目标是培养青年成为保卫与建设新民主主义国家的自觉的、积极的成员和全面发展的人才。解放以来，教师和学生的政治觉悟和教学积极性大大提高，大家都赶功课、忙工作，对过去反动统治所造成的健康不良的情况，却没有给予应有的重视，因此，提出“健康第一”的口号。这是完全符合当前的情况与要求的。但是如果片面地认为“健康第一”就是目前学校教育方针，那就模糊了学校教育的目标。
    评论进一步指出：有些学生，把“健康”与“学习”和“工作”对立起来，认为“健康第一”就是“不要学习”，或者认为“健康第一，要多吃、多玩、多休息”。这种看法，显然是曲解了“健康第一”的意义，没有认清“健康第一”的目的性。应该认识：身体健康是重要的，有了健康身体的基础，才能更好地学习，更好地工作。但是锻炼出健康的身体也决不是我们最终的目的。我们并不要培养“身体健康，脑筋简单”的庸才，而要培养刻苦耐劳、身体健康、精通技术、具有高度政治觉悟的建设干部，来从事增强祖国经济力量和国防力量的工作，来粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋，开辟我们繁荣幸福的将来。因此，只有把“健康第一”与新民主主义教育的任务紧密地结合起来，才能使这一口号有着丰富的思想内容。
    评论最后指出：有些学校认为改善学生健康情况只有搞体育活动，这种认识是不完整的。改善学生健康应该从合理地精简课程，减少不必要的会议活动，改进环境卫生，改善伙食及培养学生具有正确的生活习惯等多方面着手。
