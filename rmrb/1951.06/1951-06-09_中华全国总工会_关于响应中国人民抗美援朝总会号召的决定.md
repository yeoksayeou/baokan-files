　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Decision on Responding to the Call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea

    In order to further popularize and deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, to strengthen national defense, to strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteers so that they can more effectively cooperate with the Korean People's Army in striking against the American invading bandits, to achieve the final victory in the war to resist America and aid Korea as soon as possible, and to promote the spirit of the volunteer soldiers at the front and the people in the rear working together to defend our great motherland and world peace, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has issued a "Call for Promoting Patriotic Pledges, Donating Aircraft and Artillery, and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Soldiers." The All-China Federation of Trade Unions calls on trade union organizations and all workers to resolutely support and enthusiastically respond to this great and correct call, and to conscientiously implement the three specific and effective patriotic tasks proposed in the call as the sacred duty of trade union organizations and every worker and staff member. The following decisions are made:

    First, we call on the working masses nationwide to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to promote patriotic pledges, and to promote the movement to establish patriotic pledges, which is currently being widely carried out among workers, staff, and their families across the country, to every factory, mine, government agency, school, store, farm's team, workshop, tunnel, department, college, class, group, and other production units, learning units, and work departments, and even to the residential areas of every employee's family. We must unite and mobilize every patriotic worker, staff member, and their families under the form of patriotic pledges, based on the principle of conscious voluntarism. We suggest closely combining the method of establishing labor emulation treaties, which has already been widely promoted in factories, mines, stores, government agencies, and schools, with the establishment of patriotic pledges, and uniformly calling them patriotic emulation pledges, or simply patriotic pledges. In the patriotic pledges, we must closely combine our own daily business, work, production, and study with the overall tasks of the patriotic movement and the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, so that every article of every patriotic pledge is a "targeted," "prescriptive," practical, and readily verifiable treaty aimed at the specific tasks and shortcomings of the unit. Before establishing patriotic pledges, full publicity and explanation and democratic discussion should be conducted so that every worker can express their opinions and deeply understand the content of the pledge and propose methods to ensure the realization of the pledge. After establishing patriotic pledges, regular inspections and summaries should be made, shortcomings should be corrected at any time, and the realization of each article should be ensured, so that it does not become a mere formality and empty words.

    Second, we call on the working class nationwide to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to donate aircraft and artillery. We must organize a patriotic donation movement based entirely on the principle of individual conscious voluntarism on the basis of carrying out patriotic labor emulations, increasing product quantity, improving product quality, saving raw materials, eliminating waste, and increasing income. The donation methods can be specifically stipulated by local trade union organizations according to the different situations of each region, production unit, and work unit.

    Third, we call on the working class nationwide to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. We must ensure that the families of martyrs and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Public Security Forces receive appropriate care in terms of spiritual and material life, such as helping their families obtain work and helping their children study. When their families encounter illness or difficulties, we will help them seek medical treatment and provide possible material assistance and condolences. During festivals, workers will be organized to congratulate their families. Special preferential treatment will be given to their families when holding various entertainment evenings, and so on. Trade union organizations at all levels must regard the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers as a regular and important task. When necessary, a committee for the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers can be established to be specifically responsible for this work.

    The call issued by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea regarding the promotion of patriotic pledges, donation of aircraft and artillery, and preferential treatment of families of martyrs and soldiers is a major event of great political significance for the people of the whole country in the current glorious tasks of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the country, and defending world peace. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions firmly believes that the Chinese working class, in responding to this call, will certainly be able to exert our working class's leading role and exemplary role, just as we have done in other patriotic work in the past, so that this call can quickly become the actual action of the working masses and even the people of the whole country, in order to strive for and guarantee the final and complete victory of the just war against American imperialist aggression on the Korean battlefield as soon as possible!

    After receiving this decision, the general trade unions (or offices) of major administrative regions and the general trade unions of various provinces and cities may formulate plans and measures for implementing this decision based on the specific circumstances of the local area and report them to us.
                                              All-China Federation of Trade Unions

　　中华全国总工会
    关于响应中国人民抗美援朝总会号召的决定
    中国人民抗美援朝总会为了进一步普及与深入抗美援朝爱国运动，为了加强国防，加强支援中国人民志愿军使他们更有力地配合朝鲜人民军打击美国侵略强盗，早日取到抗美援朝战争的最后胜利，为了发扬前方志愿战士与后方人民一致努力来保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫世界和平的精神，发出了“关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮、和优待烈属、军属的号召”。中华全国总工会号召全国工会组织全体工人群众坚决拥护并热烈响应这一伟大而正确的号召，把号召中所提出的具体有效的三项爱国工作当作工会组织和每个工人职员的神圣义务而切实推行起来，特作如下之决定：
    首先，我们号召全国工人群众热烈响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于推行爱国公约的号召，把目前已经而且正在全国各地工人职员群众及其家属中广泛进行的订立爱国公约运动，推行到每一个工厂、矿山、机关、学校、商店、农场的小组、车间、坑道、系、院、班、组等生产单位学习单位和工作部门，以至每个职工家属的住宅区中去。我们要使每一个爱国的工人职员群众及其家属都根据自觉自愿的原则，在爱国公约的形式之下团结起来，行动起来。我们建议把原已在工厂、矿山、商店、机关、学校中广泛推行的订立劳动竞赛条约的办法与订立爱国公约密切结合起来，一律称为爱国竞赛公约，或简称爱国公约。在爱国公约中，我们要把我们自己的日常业务、工作、生产与学习和爱国运动的总任务和抗美援朝、镇压反革命的斗争密切的结合起来，使每一个爱国公约的每一条都是针对本单位的具体任务和工作缺点的“有的放矢”、“对症下药”、切实可行、并可随时检查的条约。在订立爱国公约之前，要作充分的宣传解释，民主讨论，使每个工人都能发表意见，都能深切了解公约的内容和提出保证实现公约的办法。在订立爱国公约之后，要定期检查总结，随时纠正缺点，保证条条实现，而不要使它流于形式，成为有名无实的条文。
    其次，我们号召全国工人阶级热烈响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于捐献飞机大炮的号召。我们要在开展爱国劳动竞赛、增加产品数量、提高产品质量、节省原料、消除浪费、增加收入的基础上，完全根据个人自觉自愿的原则，组织爱国捐献运动。其捐献办法可由各地工会组织按照各地区各个生产单位与工作单位的不同情况具体规定之。
    第三、我们号召全国工人阶级热烈响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于优待烈属军属的号召。我们要作到：使人民志愿军、人民解放军、人民公安部队的烈属军属在精神生活和物质生活方面都得到适当的照顾，如帮助他们的家属获得工作，帮助他们的子女学习。当他们的家属发生疾病困难的时候，帮助他们设法医疗，并给以可能的物质援助和慰问。当着节日的时候，组织工友向他们的家属祝贺。当举行各种娱乐晚会的时候，对他们的家属给以特殊的优待等等。各级工会组织要把优待烈属军属工作作为经常的重要的任务之一。于必要时，可成立优待烈属军属工作的委员会，专门负责这一工作。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会所发出的关于推行爱国公约捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召，是全国人民在当前抗美援朝保家卫国和保卫世界和平的光荣任务方面有重大政治意义的一件大事。中华全国总工会深信中国工人阶级在响应这一号召上，也像过去所作过的其他爱国工作一样，一定能够发挥我们工人阶级的带头作用与模范作用，使这一号召能够迅速地成为全国工人群众以至全国人民的实际行动，以争取并保证在朝鲜战场上反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争早日获得最后的完全的胜利！
    各大行政区总工会（或办事处）及各省市总工会接到本决定后，可根据当地具体情况，规定执行本决定的计划和办法并报告我们。
