Down with Complacency! Everyone Prevent and Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities!

Following the poison and arson case by special agents in Zunyi County, Guizhou, another arson case by special agents occurred in Hankou, leaving over ten thousand citizens homeless and seventeen people burned to death. We extend our condolences and sympathy to the compatriots who were victimized and affected by the disaster. At the same time, we ask that all compatriots across the country must learn a lesson from this tragic event. What lesson is that? It is that the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, who have suffered serious blows, are now engaged in the most frantic struggle! Therefore, we must never be complacent about the achievements already made in suppressing counter-revolutionaries! Down with complacency! Everyone be vigilant, actively prevent and suppress counter-revolutionary activities!

Since last October, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and thanks to the great efforts of the people across the country in cooperation with the national public security personnel, the "boundless leniency" deviation in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements has been corrected, and the policy of vigorously and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been adopted. The broad masses have been mobilized to accuse and report counter-revolutionary elements. Many heinous counter-revolutionary elements have been arrested or executed, greatly reducing the enemy's arrogance, greatly enhancing the revolutionary spirit of the people, forming a nationwide high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and achieving unprecedented victory. The people across the country rejoiced, applauded, and further consolidated the victory of the people's great revolution and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. On the basis of this victory, our correct policy is to consolidate the victory and to plan and use all the conditions created by this victory, such as the upsurge of the people's patriotic enthusiasm against special agents and spies, the enemy's panic and wavering, and the rich experience gained by the people's public security organs, to continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary activities and provide more favorable conditions for national construction. The national people's public security organs are also following this policy and continuing to advance.

However, it is undeniable that in some public security personnel, in some government staff, Communist Party members, and mass activists, there is still complacency, or new complacency has begun to emerge, and it has already caused damage to the country and the people. The fact that the Hankou special agent arson case could occur is a clear proof of this complacency. The public security personnel in Hankou, like all public security personnel, have made achievements and contributions in the great struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Unfortunately, they were somewhat complacent in their thinking in the face of the great victory of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and therefore they were somewhat lax in preventing counter-revolutionary sabotage and retaliation. They did not understand how to consolidate and develop this victory. As Comrade Stalin once pointed out, the mistake of some comrades is often that they "become dizzy with success, lose their sense of proportion, lose their ability to understand the actual situation, blindly exaggerate their own strength, and underestimate the enemy's strength." As a result, the enemy is given an opportunity to take advantage of, and the country and the people suffer damage that should have been avoided and could have been avoided.

This dangerous complacency must be resolutely and thoroughly eradicated.

How to eradicate this complacency? Every public security worker must keep in mind what Chairman Mao told us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries are by no means reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make a final struggle." Stalin also taught us: "The further we advance, the more ferocious the class enemies will be." Therefore, we must rely on the masses at all times, continue to improve our vigilance against the enemy, strengthen investigation and research, promote the enthusiasm of the people in the struggle against special agents, discover counter-revolutionary elements at any time and anywhere, immediately report them, and arrest them and bring them to justice. If the counter-revolutionary elements dare to act rashly, they must be crushed to pieces. We must be good at relying on the people. The people must fully understand that counter-revolution and revolution are absolutely irreconcilable. The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries is by no means over just because a group of counter-revolutionary elements have been killed. As long as there are counter-revolutionaries, they will inevitably try every means to oppose the People's Government and endanger the lives and property of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the people must be vigilant, always vigilant, always guarding against counter-revolutionary activities, and be prepared to put out counter-revolutionary activities. Now the broad masses have greatly awakened in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The question is whether we can effectively promote this enthusiasm and organize this enthusiasm into the ongoing movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Today, we are also publishing a report on the people of Tianjin assisting the government in reporting a large number of counter-revolutionary elements. This report shows that the people of Tianjin have reported 1,967 counter-revolutionary cases in two months. The reporters include workers, staff, industrialists, businessmen, farmers, students, women, and children. They have all included assisting the government in preventing counter-revolutionary activities and discovering and capturing counter-revolutionary elements in the patriotic pacts, and they have earnestly implemented them. Tianjin's experience should be widely promoted throughout the country, so that the whole of China becomes a dragnet for monitoring counter-revolutionary elements.

Experience has shown that the masses' patriotic anti-espionage pacts and the masses' public security committees or public security groups are good forms for the masses to carry out the struggle against special agents and spies. In this Hankou special agent arson case, the counter-revolutionary elements had been preparing for a long time, and they took advantage of the time when the masses were all going to meetings to carry out their conspiracy. If the masses' public security work is done well, and the public security personnel are not relaxed or complacent, and everyone is highly vigilant at all times, the enemy's conspiracy can be prevented in advance. Therefore, every patriotic compatriot in the country, every activist among the urban and rural men, women, old and young residents, every Communist Party member, Youth League member, propagandist, trade union member, farmers' association member, Federation of Industry and Commerce member, especially every public security worker, should draw a painful lesson from the Zunyi poisoning case and the Hankou arson case, break any complacency, universally establish patriotic anti-espionage pacts and public security groups, strictly protect social security, prevent fire and poison, prevent sabotage, monitor the whereabouts of suspicious elements, and ensure that the painful events of this kind in Zunyi and Hankou will never happen again in the future.

### 打倒麻痹！人人都来防范和扑灭反革命活动！

　　打倒麻痹！人人都来防范和扑灭反革命活动！
    接着贵州遵义县特务放毒放火案件之后，汉口又发生了特务放火的案件，使万余市民无家可归，十七人被烧死。我们谨向遇害和被灾的同胞致以哀悼和慰问。同时我们要求全国同胞必须从这件悲痛的事件中得到教训。什么教训呢？这就是：已经遭受严重打击的反革命残余分子，正在进行最疯狂的挣扎！因此，我们决不应该满足于镇压反革命所已得的成绩而麻痹起来！打倒麻痹！人人都警惕起来，积极防范和扑灭反革命活动！
    去年十月以来，由于毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，由于全国人民协同全国公安工作人员的巨大努力，纠正了对待反革命分子的“宽大无边”偏向，采取了大张旗鼓坚决镇压反革命的方针，广大群众动员起来，控诉与检举反革命分子，许多罪大恶极的反革命分子被逮捕或处决，使敌人的凶焰大大降低，人民群众革命的正气大大伸张了，形成了全国性的镇压反革命的高潮，取得了空前的胜利；全国人民欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快，进一步地巩固了人民大革命的胜利，巩固了人民民主专政。在这种胜利的基础上，我们的正确方针是巩固胜利，并有计划地运用这种胜利所创造的一切条件，例如人民反特务防奸细的爱国热情的高涨，敌人的恐慌动摇，人民公安机关取得的丰富经验，继续肃清反革命活动，给国家建设提供更有利的条件。全国人民公安机关，也正是遵循着这种方针，继续前进的。
    但是，不可否认，在某些公安工作人员中，在某些政府工作人员、共产党员和群众积极分子中，仍然存在着麻痹思想，或者是开始产生新的麻痹思想，并且已经因此使国家与人民受到损害。汉口特务纵火案居然能够发生，就是这种麻痹现象的一个明证。汉口的公安工作人员在镇压反革命的伟大斗争中，同所有公安工作人员一样，是有成绩的，有功劳的。所可惜的是他们在镇压反革命运动的伟大胜利面前思想上有些麻痹了，因而对于防止反革命的破坏和报复也就有些松懈了，他们不懂得应该怎样去巩固与发展这种胜利。如同斯大林同志所曾经指出过的，有一部分同志的错误往往是“因有胜利而头昏眼花起来，丧失权衡轻重的知觉，丧失了解实际情况的能力，一味夸大自己的力量，轻视敌人的力量”。其结果就是给敌人以可乘之机，使国家与人民遭受本来应该避免而又可能避免的损害。
    这种危险的麻痹思想，必须坚决地彻底地加以铲除。
    怎样来铲除这种麻痹思想呢？每一个公安工作人员都必须牢记毛主席所告诉我们的：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”斯大林也曾教导我们：“我们愈往前进，阶级敌人就愈为凶恶。”因此我们必须时时刻刻依靠群众，继续提高对于敌人的警惕性，加强调查研究工作，发扬人民群众反特务斗争的积极性，随时随地发现反革命分子，立即检举，予以逮捕法办。如果反革命分子胆敢轻举妄动，就必须使他们粉身碎骨。我们必须善于依靠人民群众。必须使人民群众完全懂得：反革命同革命是绝对不能两立的。镇压反革命的斗争，绝对没有因为杀了一批反革命分子而完结。只要有反革命存在，它就必然要千方百计来反对人民政府来危害广大人民生命财产的安全，因此人民群众就必须个个提高警惕性，时时刻刻提高警惕性，时时刻刻防范反革命活动，准备扑灭反革命活动。现在广大群众在镇压反革命运动中已经有了很大的觉悟，问题就在于我们是否能够有效地发扬这种积极性，并把这种积极性组织到正在继续进行的镇压反革命运动中来。
    今天我们同时发表了天津市人民协助政府检举大批反革命分子的通讯。这个通讯表明天津市人民在两个月里已经检举了一千九百六十七件反革命案件，检举人包括工人、职员、工商业家、农民、学生、妇女和儿童。他们都把协助政府防范反革命活动、发现和捕捉反革命分子订入爱国公约，并且认真地实行了起来。天津的这个经验，应当在全国普遍地推广起来，使全中国变为监视反革命分子的天罗地网。
    经验证明，群众的爱国防奸公约，群众的治安保卫委员会或治安小组，乃是群众进行反特务防奸细斗争的良好形式。这次汉口特务纵火案件，反革命分子曾经作了长时间的准备，并且乘群众全去开会的时候，来施其阴谋。如果群众的治安工作做好，公安人员又不松懈、麻痹，大家时时都有高度的警惕性，敌人的阴谋就可以在事前制止。因此，全国每一个爱国同胞，城乡男女老少居民中的每一个积极分子，每一个共产党员、青年团员、宣传员、工会会员、农民协会会员、工商联合会会员，特别是每一个公安工作人员，都应当从遵义放毒案、汉口放火案中间得到沉痛的教训，打破任何麻痹思想，普遍成立爱国防奸公约和治安小组，严密地保卫社会治安，防火防毒，防止破坏，监视可疑分子的行踪，保证遵义、汉口的这一类惨痛事件今后不再发生。
