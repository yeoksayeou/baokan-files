    Shanghai, Jinan, and Qiqihar Literary and Art Circles Launch Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Propaganda

　　Literary and art circles in Shanghai, Jinan, and Qiqihar are actively participating in the propaganda campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In Shanghai, from May 25th to 31st, the Quyi (folk art forms) community held a week-long performance and propaganda campaign on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Most theaters in the city staged plays with the theme of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Street performers were provided with dozens of performance materials by the Opera Reform Working Association and also carried out performances in the streets and amusement parks. Two hundred playwrights and directors of various opera genres in the city, under the leadership of the Quyi Current Affairs Propaganda Committee, completed more than 150 scripts, including Peking Opera, Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera, comic drama, Pingtan (storytelling and ballad singing), Jianghuai Opera, Weiyang Opera, Yong Opera, and Changxi Opera. It is estimated that the audience reached about 700,000 people during the propaganda week. Many of these plays were well received by the audience. More than one hundred theaters, storytelling venues, and amusement parks in the city, in conjunction with the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Performance and Propaganda Week, decorated their venues with cartoons, clippings, red couplets, slide shows, public address system reports, and moving advertising models to carry out propaganda and education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to the audience in various ways. The Jinan Quyi community organized a propaganda team to hold open-air performances at the exhibition of banning reactionary secret societies. From May 17th to 25th, a total of 514 performances were held continuously, with an audience of approximately 700,000 people. There were 48 new programs, most of which focused on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, combined with current affairs propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea. Among them, "Exposing Yiguandao" and "Executing Liu Qishan" were very popular among the masses. Under the leadership of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Propaganda Committee of Qiqihar City, the literary and art circles of Qiqihar widely launched propaganda activities to suppress counter-revolutionaries from May 13th to 26th, involving drama, Quyi, film, music, and fine arts. The activities were carried out in a flexible manner, with open-air performances held at six fixed locations. In addition, units such as the Provincial Cultural Troupe, the Quyi Association, and the Cultural Center were organized to go deep into the streets and residential areas to perform "Aunt Yao Catches a Spy," etc. Open-air screenings of films such as "The Party Membership Card" and "The Invisible Front," and the Peking Opera Troupe performed the new Ping Opera "The Sage's Way." In fourteen days, the audience for drama, film, and Quyi reached more than 160,000 people, accounting for more than 80% of the city's population. A large number of songs and propaganda posters with the theme of suppressing counter-revolutionaries were also distributed to factories, schools, government agencies, and residents, and were warmly welcomed by the masses.

　　A Few Articles Guiding the Writing of Works on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

　　As a creative movement with the theme of suppressing counter-revolutionaries unfolds across the country, some newspapers and periodicals have published articles guiding creation. For example, "Mobilize Literary and Art Forces to Participate in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Propaganda" (Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee) published in this newspaper on the 31st of last month, "Massively Create Literary and Art Works on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" (written by Liu Ying) published in Yangtze River Literature and Art, Volume 4, Issue 4, "Some Issues on the Creation of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries" (written by Bai Shi) published in Northeast Literature and Art, Volume 3, Issue 5, and "Several Opinions on Creating Works with the Theme of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries" (written by Guo Feng) published in Northeast Daily on May 10th, etc., are helpful to this creative movement. The opinions of these articles can be summarized into four points: 1. It is necessary to write about the political significance of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and not just stay at the level of personal grievances and revenge. It is necessary to write that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the most important means of the people's democratic dictatorship and is closely related to the people's happy life and the interests of the country. It is necessary to write about the connection between the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and resisting America and aiding Korea, the role of land reform and production construction, and also to write that this is a long-term and complex struggle. 2. It is necessary to expose the reactionary essence of counter-revolutionaries, expose their political conspiracies, and at the same time expose the internal connections between these conspiracies and Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. It is necessary to clarify that the people's struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries is actually a manifestation of patriotism. 3. It is necessary to focus on writing about the strength of the people's forces and depicting those new characters who bravely fight against counter-revolutionaries. When describing the harm of counter-revolutionaries to the country and the people and their vicious conspiracies, do not excessively exaggerate the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries and deliberately describe those gloomy and terrifying scenes, causing fear and terror to readers or audiences. 4. It is necessary to more accurately portray the faces of various counter-revolutionaries and expose their reactionary faces truthfully and thoroughly. Do not portray counter-revolutionaries as all wearing hats crookedly, so that people can see through them at a glance.

　　国内文艺动态
    上海、济南、齐齐哈尔文艺界展开镇压反革命宣传
    上海、济南、齐齐哈尔市文艺界积极参加镇压反革命宣传活动。上海自五月二十五日至三十一日曲艺界举行了一个镇压反革命演唱宣传周，全市各戏院大都上演了以镇压反革命为内容的戏；街头艺人由戏曲改革工作者协会供给了几十种演唱资料，也在街头和游艺场中展开演唱。全市各剧种的二百个编导，在曲艺界时事宣传委员会领导下，完成了一百五十多出剧本，其中包括京剧、越剧、沪剧、滑稽话剧、评弹、江淮戏、维扬戏、甬剧、常锡剧等。宣传周内估计观众约达七十余万人。其中有不少戏获得观众好评。全市一百数十家戏院、书场、游艺场等结合镇压反革命演唱宣传周，在戏场中布置了漫画、剪贴、红布对联、放映幻灯、扩大机报告、活动广告模型等，用多种多样的方式，向观众进行了镇压反革命的宣传教育。济南曲艺界组织了一个宣传大队，在取缔反动道会门展览会中，举行露天演唱。自五月十七日至二十五日，共连续演出五百一十四场，观众约达七十余万。演唱的新节目有四十八个，内容大部以镇压反革命为主，结合抗美援朝时事宣传。其中《揭露一贯道》，《枪毙刘岐山》等，很受群众欢迎。齐齐哈尔文艺界，在该市镇压反革命宣传委员会领导下，从五月十三日到二十六日，戏剧、曲艺、电影、音乐、美术等广泛地展开了镇压反革命宣传活动。活动方式较灵活，有六个固定地点举行露天演出；另组织省文工团、艺曲公会、文化馆等单位轮回深入街道居民，演出《姚大娘捉特务》等；露天放映电影《党证》、《无形的战线》等，京剧团演出新评剧《圣人道》。在十四天内，戏剧、电影、曲艺观众达十六万多人，占全市人口百分之八十以上。其他以镇压反革命为内容的大量的歌曲、宣传画，均深入工厂、学校、机关、居民中去，获得了群众的热烈欢迎。
            几篇指导写镇压反革命作品的文章
    在全国展开以镇压反革命为主题的创作运动的时候，有些报刊登载了一些指导创作的文章。像本报上月三十一日登载的《把文艺力量动员起来参加镇压反革命宣传》（中共中央华北局宣传部）、长江文艺四卷四期登载的《大量创作镇压反革命的文艺作品》（柳映作）、东北文艺三卷五期登载的《关于镇压反革命创作上的一些问题》（白石作），东北日报五月十日登载的《对创作以镇压反革命为主题的作品的几点意见》（郭锋作）等文，对于这一创作运动是有帮助的。综合这些文章的意见大致有四：一、要写出镇压反革命的政治意义，不要只停留在个人的伸冤报仇上。要写出镇压反革命是人民民主专政的最主要的手段，是与人民的幸福生活与国家的利益休戚相关的。要写出镇压反革命与抗美援朝的联系，对土地改革，生产建设的作用，并要写出这是一个长期和复杂的斗争。二、要揭发反革命分子的反动本质，揭发他的政治阴谋，同时要揭发这些阴谋活动和蒋介石、美帝国主义的内部联系。要阐明人民镇压反革命的斗争，实际上是一种爱国主义的表现。三、要集中地写出人民力量的强大，描写那些勇敢和反革命分子作斗争的新人物。在描写反革命分子对国家人民的危害性及其恶毒阴谋时，不要过分地渲染反革命份子的嚣张气焰，和故意描写那些阴森恐怖的场面，造成读者或观众的畏惧、恐怖。四、要更确切地刻划各种反革命分子的面貌，真实地彻底地暴露他们的反动面目。不要把反革命分子描写得个个都是歪戴帽子，一眼都能让人看破。
