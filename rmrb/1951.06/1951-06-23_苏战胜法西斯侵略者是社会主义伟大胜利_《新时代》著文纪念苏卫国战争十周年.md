Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd -- TASS reports: The Soviet magazine "New Era," recently published in its 25th issue, released an editorial and articles commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Soviet Great Patriotic War on June 22nd. The editorial points out: Ten years ago, the Hitler bandits and those who encouraged their crimes regarded the Soviet Union's peaceful policies as a sign of Soviet military weakness. The Hitler bandits have paid for this misjudgment with their criminal heads. Recalling this history helps to correctly assess today's most important events. The Soviet victory over the fascist aggressors in Europe and the Far East was a victory for the socialist society and state system, and liberated the people of many countries. Now, more than one-third of the world's population, eight hundred million people, have established the political power of the working people. The great historical lessons have educated the people of all countries to recognize the strength and possibilities they possess in the struggle to defend peace and oppose war.

Major General Isayev published an article entitled "Despicable Strategy," stating: The military theories of German fascism were primarily based on reactionary ideas of racism. Today, the theorists of American imperialism promote the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race and the doctrine of the "American way of life," which is essentially a replica of Hitler's doctrine. Isayev emphasized: This racist theory and the struggle for world hegemony are precisely the source of the weakness that ultimately led to the demise of fascist Germany.

　　苏战胜法西斯侵略者是社会主义伟大胜利
    《新时代》著文纪念苏卫国战争十周年
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近出版的苏联《新时代》杂志第二十五期发表社论和文章，纪念六月二十二日苏联伟大卫国战争十周年。社论指出：十年以前，希特勒匪帮和鼓励它犯罪的人们把苏联的和平政策当作苏联军事上弱点的表现。希特勒匪帮由于估计错误已用犯罪的头颅付出了代价。回忆这些历史，是有助于正确地估计今天最重要的事件的。苏联战胜欧洲和远东的法西斯侵略者，是社会主义社会和国家制度的胜利，并且解放了许多国家的人民。现在，占全世界三分之一以上的八亿人民已经建立了劳动人民的政权了。伟大的历史教训已经教育各国人民认识到他们在保卫和平与反对战争的斗争中所具有的力量和可能性。
    伊萨耶夫少将以“卑鄙的战略”为题发表文章说：德国法西斯主义者的军事理论，首先是根据种族主义的反动思想。今天美帝国主义的理论家们宣传盎格鲁—撒克逊种族的优越性和“美国生活方式”的学说，在本质上纯粹是希特勒学说的翻版。伊萨耶夫强调指出：这种种族主义的理论和对世界霸权的争夺，正是法西斯德国最后归于灭亡的弱点的来源。
