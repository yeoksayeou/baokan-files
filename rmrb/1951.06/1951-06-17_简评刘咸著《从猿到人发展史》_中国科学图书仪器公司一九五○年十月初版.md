A Brief Review of Liu Xian's "The History of Development from Ape to Man"
China Science Book and Instrument Company, First Edition, October 1950
Han Wenli

	The development from ape to man is the first problem we encounter when studying the history of social development. If this problem is not understood correctly, it will greatly hinder us from establishing a dialectical materialist viewpoint. Many people have lost their way on this issue, and as a result, have had to embrace idealism, turning the question of human origin into a great mystery. Thanks to Engels, he clearly indicated the direction of understanding for us on this issue. He pointed out that "labor created man" is the only scientific explanation.

	However, this scientific truth is often misinterpreted. Liu Xian's "The History of Development from Ape to Man" is an example. Mr. Liu's book has at least the following shortcomings:

	First, the viewpoint is idealistic. For example, when the forests disappeared, how did our ancestors—the ape-men—cope with this new environment? The author of this book writes: "What should be done in such a situation of hunger, cold, and life-or-death crisis? If one were to stick to the remaining forest, 'using invariance to control all changes,' the only foreseeable consequence would be waiting to starve to death in the trees… Otherwise, one should use one's brains, think of ways to cope with this extraordinary environment and fight against nature." (Page 73)

	Doesn't this imply that ancient ape-men, who had not yet begun to work, were already capable of thinking?

	On page 76, the author expresses this idealistic tone even more clearly. He says that our ape-man ancestors, "felt the vastness of the world, unable to find peace, and recalled the joy of the mountains and forests in the past, where food was abundant, truly feeling the contrast between then and now. Could such a life go on forever?"

	The author answers: "Our ancestors, on the one hand, suffered from the hardships of life, and on the other hand, also engaged in self-criticism. What were their shortcomings? Why couldn't they adapt to the new environment? How could they overcome these poisonous snakes and fierce beasts? Where to begin to transform themselves? A series of questions arose, constantly thinking, humbly experiencing, and after a long period, they finally gained some practical experience. They adopted the coordinated principles of dividing units, proceeding simultaneously, partial subordination to the whole, and the whole taking care of the parts, and transformed themselves on a large scale, achieving unexpected results."

	Doesn't this mean that our ape-man ancestors relied on self-criticism and "constant thinking" to transform their bodies into humans? Chapter 5 of this book fully explains this evolutionary process from this perspective.

	Doesn't this mean that thinking came before labor?

	Second, the author sees the differences in the bodies of humans and apes only as quantitative changes, not qualitative changes. For example, after explaining the various differences between humans and apes, he says that the difference between humans and apes "is more of a quantitative difference than a difference in nature." (Page 24) This is incorrect. Humans and apes not only have "quantitative" differences, but also "qualitative" differences. For example, the human hand can make tools for labor, but the ape's "hand" cannot; humans can stand completely upright, but apes cannot; humans can produce language with syllables, but apes cannot; the human brain is not only on average about three times larger than the ape's, but it can also think, while the ape's brain cannot. Aren't these differences the result of qualitative changes?

	Third, the author incorrectly views changes in natural conditions during the ape-man transformation process as a simple, sudden change. For example, in describing the arrival of the Ice Age, he writes: "The ice from the Arctic Ocean attacked southward, overwhelming and extremely powerful, impossible to resist, freezing everything in its path." (Page 73). Such a sudden, overwhelming disaster destroyed forests and animals, but ancient ape-men were able to "use their brains, think of ways," and miraculously transform into humans in this "bitterly cold" environment. In reality, climate change, whether in the past or in the present, is gradual. Therefore, the cooling of the climate at that time was gradual. Mr. Liu also acknowledges this (page 73). Because the cooling (or warming) of the climate is slow, it takes a long time to manifest, so the change in forests is also slow, and it takes a long time for forests to disappear. Therefore, ancient apes had ample time, in the long process of labor, to transform into ape-men and leave the forests to live. If the forests had disappeared suddenly before the ancient apes had become ape-men, and the ground had been covered with ice and snow all at once, then the transformation of ancient apes into humans would be unimaginable. You must know that the ape-men's main means of dealing with the cold were fire and hunting. Would ancient apes use fire as soon as they came down from the trees? Would they hunt? You must know that the transformation of ancient apes into humans was not due to sudden climate change, nor was it due to "courage" and "determination"; it was due to long-term, slowly learned labor.

	Fourth, is the erroneous interpretation of the famous sayings of thinkers. For example, Engels said that the emergence of language depended on labor. How does the author explain the relationship between labor and language? He writes: "Because humans needed to exchange ideas, they constantly exercised the various organs in their oral cavity, most importantly the tongue, and over time, they became proficient in using them, emitting the necessary syllables to express their meaning. The so-called exercise is, of course, the vocal organs at labor." (Page 99)

	The "labor" of the vocal organs is not enough, there must also be the "labor" of the receiving organs, so the author writes: "Sound waves vibrate the malleus, the malleus strikes the incus, the incus rings, transmitting to the stapes, the stapes transmits to the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is a spiral tube, filled with liquid, with hair cells connecting to the auditory nerve. The human ear can receive sound wave frequencies from thirty to ten thousand times per second, or even more, thus it can be seen that the entire process of listening to sounds is a process of labor." (Page 101)

	Thus, at the end of this section, the author writes: "Engels said: 'Language arises from and together with labor.' Indeed, 'this explanation is the only correct explanation.'" (Page 101)

	In reality, the labor that Engels spoke of is completely different from the labor that the author speaks of. Engels was saying that the human production labor process and its results transformed human physiological conditions, making the emergence and development of language possible, but the author interprets it as purely physiological action.

	In short, this book is an idealistic work. I hope Mr. Liu Xian will consider the opinions raised in this article. I hope he can thoroughly revise what he has written.

　　简评刘咸著《从猿到人发展史》
    中国科学图书仪器公司一九五○年十月初版
    韩文理
    从猿到人是我们学习社会发展史时所遇到的第一个问题。对这问题如果理解得不正确，就会大大地阻碍我们去建立辩证唯物论的观点。有不少人在这一问题上迷失了方向，结果不得不投入唯心论的怀抱，把人类起源问题，弄成一个大谜。谢谢恩格斯，他在这一问题上，给我们明确地指示了认识的方向。他指出，“劳动创造了人”是唯一科学的说明。
    但是这一个科学真理，却时常被人曲解着。刘咸先生的《从猿到人发展史》就是一个例子。刘先生这一本书最少有如下的缺点：
    第一，观点是唯心的。比方说吧，在森林消灭的时候，我们的祖先——人猿，怎样应付这新环境呢？本书著者这样写着：“当这样饥寒交迫，生死关头，怎么办呢？若说株守残林，‘以不变驭万变’，那惟一的后果，可以预料到的，就是在树上等着饿死………。不然的话，就该动动脑筋，想想法子，来应付这个非常的环境和自然界来斗争一番。”（七三页）
    这不是等于说，还没有开始劳动的古代人猿，已经能够思维了吗？
    在七十六页，著者把这唯心论调发挥得更显明。他说，我们的人猿祖先，“感到世界之大，不遑宁处，回想以前山林之乐，食物无缺，诚不胜今昔之感。这样的生活能永远过下去吗？”
    著者这样回答说：“我们的祖先，一面受到生活的煎迫，同时也自我批评了一番。自己到底有些什么缺点？为什么不能适应新环境？怎样才能制胜这些毒蛇猛兽？改造自己，从那里做起？发生了一连串的问题，不断的思维，虚心体验，经过了冗长的时期，终于得着了一些实际的经验。采取了分别单元，同时进行，部分服从整体，整体照顾部分的协调原则，大规模地改造起来，获得了意想不到的效果。”
    这不是说，我们的人猿祖先就是靠着自我批评和“不断的思维”，把身体改变成为人吗？本书的第五章就是充分用这一观点来说明这一演变过程的。
    这不是说，先有思维，后有劳动吗？
    第二，著者把人和猿身体上的区别只看成量变而不看成质变，例如在说明人和猿的种种不同之后，他说人和猿的不同，“与其说是性质的分别，毋宁说是数量的差别。”（第二十四页）这是不正确的。人和猿不仅有“量”的不同，而且有“质”的不同。比方说吧，人的手会制造工具进行劳动，猿的“手”不会；人会完全直立，猿不会；人会发出有音节的语言，猿不会；人的大脑不仅平均比猿约大了三倍，而且会思维，猿的大脑不会。这些不同，不是质变的结果吗？
    第三，著者把猿人变化过程中的自然条件的变化不正确的看做一种单纯的突变过程。例如在描述冰期到来的时候，他这样写到：“北冰洋的冰流向南进袭，排山倒海，威力极大，莫能抵御，所到之处，随即冻结。”（第七三页）。这样突如其来的滔天大祸，毁灭了森林和动物，而古代人猿却能在这“溯风凛冽，冷澈心肺”的绝境中，“动动脑筋，想想法子”，摇身一变而成为人了。实际上，气候的变化，不管在过去或是在现在，都是渐渐的。所以那时气候的变冷是渐渐的。这一点，刘先生也承认（第七十三页）。因为气候的变冷（或变热）是缓慢的，要经过长时期才能表现出来，所以森林的变化也是缓慢的，要经过长时期森林才会消灭。因此古猿才有充分的时间，在悠长的劳动过程中，变成为猿人，脱离了森林来生活。如果在古猿还没有变成猿人的时候，森林就一下子消灭，地面就一下子盖满了冰雪，那末古猿的变为人是难以想像的。要知道，猿人的对付寒冷，主要是靠着火和狩猎。古猿一下树来就会用火吗？会进行狩猎吗？要知道，古猿的变成人，不是靠着气候的突然变化，也不是靠着“勇气”和“决心”；而是靠着长期的慢慢学来的劳动。
    第四，是错误地解释思想家的名言。例如恩格斯说语言的发生靠着劳动。著者对于劳动与语言的关系怎样说明呢？他这样写道：“人类因有交换意见的需要，不断地把口腔内的几种器官，最重要的是舌，加以练习运动，久而久之运用纯熟，就发出所需要的音节，来表达自己的意思。这里所谓练习运动，当然是发音器官在劳动。”（第九九页）
    发音器官的“劳动”还不够，还要有收音器管的“劳动”，于是著者这样写道：“音波震动锤骨，锤骨向砧骨打一锤，砧骨叮噹一响，传到镫骨，镫骨传到内耳的耳蜗。耳蜗为螺旋形管，内中充满液体，有毛细胞通听神经。人类耳朵每秒钟能接受音波频率由三十次到一万次，或更多些，由此可见收听声音全部的过程，都是劳动的过程。”（第一○一页）
    于是，著者在这一节的结束中，这样写着：“恩格斯说：‘语言是从劳动当中并和劳动一起产生出来的。’的确‘这个解释是唯一正确的解释。’”（第一○一页）
    实际上，恩格斯所说的劳动，和著者所说的劳动完全是两回事。恩格斯说的是人类生产劳动过程及其结果改造了人类生理条件，使语言的发生和发展成为可能，著者却把它解释为纯生理的动作了。
    总之，这一本书是唯心论的作品。我希望刘咸先生考虑本文所提的意见。希望他能把自己所写的东西，彻底地修正一下。
