    30,000 People Rush to Build a Large-Scale Water Diversion Sluice Gate Project in the Middle Reaches of the Huai River
    Working in shifts day and night, striving to complete it before the flood season.
    The Runheji water diversion sluice gate in the middle reaches of the Huai River is currently under construction day and night. 30,000 people are involved in the construction of this project, and they are striving to complete it before the flood season arrives. At present, more than 80% of the total earthwork has been completed, and part of the concrete pouring work has also been completed. The large-scale water diversion sluice gate has laid a solid foundation. The 30,000 people participating in this huge project include approximately 10,000 skilled workers such as electricians, pumping workers, rebar workers, welders, carpenters, stonemasons, and bamboo workers, as well as transportation workers, and approximately 20,000 rural laborers doing earthwork. In addition, there are many engineers from all over the country, as well as university and technical school students assisting the engineers in technical guidance.
    The entire water diversion sluice gate project is divided into three main parts: a fixed river channel, a river-blocking gate (controlling the amount of Huai River water entering the fixed river channel), and a lake-entry gate (controlling the amount of Huai River water entering Chenxi Lake). In order to speed up construction, various projects are being carried out simultaneously. On May 12, all the skilled workers and engineering personnel concentrated their efforts on pouring concrete for the foundations of the two gates and the fixed river channel. By the end of May, more than 8,000 cubic meters of concrete had been poured. To consolidate the gate foundation, clay must be laid on the foundation of the gate, and stone must be thrown near the gate foundation. The work of laying clay and building stone is also being carried out intensively. It is expected that the concrete pouring project can be completed in June, and the installation of the gate can be started. In July, the entire project can be completed.
    The Runheji water diversion sluice gate is a technically complex project. The cement, rubble, yellow sand, steel bars, and various machinery required for the project weigh more than 200,000 tons in total, all of which need to be transported from places ranging from 100 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers away. At the construction site wharf, 4,000 tons of materials are received every day, and then transported to various construction sections by dump trucks on light railways or by manual labor. All 60,000 tons of yellow sand and gravel used in the entire project must also be processed and screened before they can be used. Due to the lack of screening machinery and equipment, it had to be screened entirely manually at the beginning. Now water pumps have been installed, and water is pumped to flush and wash it. In order to ensure that the project can be completed in a timely manner, four generators have been installed near the construction site, 50 kilometers of power lines have been erected on the construction site, and electric lights have been installed everywhere. All workers and engineering personnel are working in shifts day and night. At night, the construction site is brightly lit with thousands of lights, like a small town.

### 三万人赶修淮河中游分水闸大工程  日夜不停轮班工作，争取汛期以前修成。

　　三万人赶修淮河中游分水闸大工程        
    日夜不停轮班工作，争取汛期以前修成。
    淮河中游现正日夜不停地赶修润河集分水闸。修建这个工程的有三万人，他们争取在汛期到来以前修成。现在，全部土方工程已经完成了百分之八十以上，浇灌混凝土的工程也已完成了一部分。规模宏大的分水闸已奠定了巩固的基础。参加这一巨大工程的三万人包括电工，抽水工、扎铁筋工、焊工、木工、石工、竹工等技术工人和搬运工人约一万人，作土工的民工约两万人。此外，还有很多来自全国各地的工程师，和协助工程师作技术指导工作的大学生和专科学校的学生。
    整个分水闸工程分三个主要部分：固定河槽、拦河闸（控制淮水入固定河槽的水量）和进湖闸（控制淮河入城西湖的水量）。为了赶修，各项工程都是同时进行的。五月十二日，全部技术工人和工程人员，集中力量进行两座闸基和固定河槽的浇灌混凝土的工程，到五月底止，已经浇灌了八千多公方混凝土。为了闸基巩固，修闸的地基上要铺设黏土，闸基附近还要抛石，这个铺黏土和砌石的工作，也在突击进行。预计六月内可完成浇灌混凝土的工程，并可开始按装闸门。七月内，全部工程就可完成。
    润河集分水闸是一个技术很繁复的工程。工程上所需的水泥、块石、黄沙、钢筋和各种机械等共重二十多万吨，全部需从一百公里以至一千公里以外的地方运来。工地码头上，每天要接收四千吨物资，然后再用轻便铁道上的斗车或人力分运到各个施工的地段上去。全部工程所用的六万吨黄沙和石子，还需经过加工筛洗以后才能应用。因为缺乏筛洗的机械设备，开始时只好完全用人工来筛洗。现在已装了抽水机，用抽水机抽水来冲洗。为了保证工程能够及时完成，工地附近装了四部发电机，工地上架设了五十公里长的电线，各处装了电灯，全体工人和工程人员均日夜不停地轮班工作。入夜，工地万盏灯火，像一座小的市镇一样。
