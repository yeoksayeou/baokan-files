　　Correctly Lead the Increase Production and Donation Campaign
    The people of the whole country are participating in the patriotic action of donating airplanes and cannons to support the front with unprecedented enthusiasm. In the past ten days, according to extremely incomplete statistics from only a few places, the number of airplanes that people in various places have decided to donate has reached more than 140, and the number of other weapons and cash decided to be donated has not yet been calculated. Although these figures only represent the initial results of the donation campaign, they are already enough to illustrate the enormous power of this movement, and they are already enough to illustrate the enormous power of the great Chinese people who have awakened and united.
    The patriotic donation enthusiasm of the masses has already risen. The current task of the leadership organs in various places and all patriotic activists is to guide the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses onto a sound track.
    First, the donation of weapons must be combined with increasing production, improving management, improving work, and increasing income, so that, on the one hand, more weapons to kill the enemy can be supplied to the front, and on the other hand, the construction of the country can be promoted. Many places and many people are doing this now, and they have created a variety of ways to increase production and donate weapons. Among them, it is particularly worth mentioning that some cadres and students in Beijing have formed patriotic labor groups, stipulating Sunday as a patriotic labor day, and donating the wages earned to support the front. Many places of workers and staff have also decided to work one or two more days each month, called "Supporting the Korean War Front Line Work Day." This approach is very good and worth promoting. If every cadres, every student, and every worker participates in one day of labor or does one more day of work each month, this will have a huge effect not only on supporting the front but also on strengthening economic construction. On the other hand, some students and teachers, as well as people from other walks of life, also have practices that do not focus on increasing production. Their high degree of patriotism is very valuable, but we believe that in practice, we must advocate making long-term plans from a positive perspective.
    Second, the amount of donations should be appropriate, and should not reduce the living standards of the working masses, nor should it affect the ability and enthusiasm of the masses to expand reproduction. Now the enthusiasm of the peasant activists and patriotic activists in the industrial and commercial circles for the donation campaign is also very valuable, but their practices must also pay attention not to affect the enthusiasm of the masses for increasing production and improving management.
    Third, donations must adhere to the principle of conscious voluntariness, and prevent any forced apportioning or disguised forced apportioning. The purpose of promoting the movement to increase production and donate weapons is not only to strengthen support for the front and strengthen economic construction, but also to use this movement to educate the masses and improve them politically. If forced apportioning or disguised forced apportioning is allowed, the masses will not be educated, but rather political losses will be caused to us. But this does not mean that we should not publicize increased production and donations; rather, it means that when mobilizing the masses to increase production and donations, we must fully explain the significance of increasing production and donations, and explain the principle that everyone is responsible for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, so that the masses can voluntarily and actively increase production and donate weapons; and make the masses, through the patriotic action of increasing production and donations, further improve their political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm.

### 正确地领导增产捐献运动

　　正确地领导增产捐献运动
    全国人民正以空前的积极性参加捐献飞机大炮支援前线的爱国行动。旬日以来，仅据少数地方的极不完全材料统计，各地人民决定捐献的飞机数目，已达到一百四十架以上，而决定捐献其他武器及现款的数字尚未计算在内。虽然这些数字只是代表捐献运动的初步成果，但是它已经足以说明这个运动具有多么巨大的威力，已经足以说明觉悟起来和团结起来了的伟大的中国人民具有多么巨大的威力。
    人民群众的爱国捐献热情已经起来了，各地领导机关和所有爱国积极分子目前的任务，就是要把人民群众的这种爱国热情引到健全的轨道上去。
    第一、捐献武器一定要与增加生产、改善经营、提高工作、增加收入相结合，以便一方面能以更多的杀敌武器源源供给前线，另一方面，又可以推进国家的建设。现在许多地方许多群众都是这样做的，他们创造了多种多样的增加生产、捐献武器的办法。其中特别值得提出的是：北京有些机关职员和学生，已经纷纷组成爱国劳动小组，规定星期日为爱国劳动日，以所赚得的工资捐献出来，支援前线。许多地方的职工也决定把每个月多做工一天或两天，名为“支援抗美援朝前线工作日”。这种做法是很好的，值得提倡的。如果每个机关职员、每个学生、每个工人每个月都参加一天劳动或多做一天工，这不但对于支援前线，而且对于加强经济建设都会有巨大的作用。另一方面有一些学生和教师，及其他各界人民中，也有不从增加生产着眼的做法。他们高度的爱国热情是十分可贵的，但是我们认为在做法上必须提倡从积极方面作长远的打算。
    第二、捐款的数字要适当，不要降低劳动群众的生活水平，不要影响群众扩大再生产的能力和积极性。现在农民的积极分子和工商界爱国积极分子对于捐献运动的热情也是十分可贵的，但是他们的做法也必须注意不要影响到群众的增加生产和改善经营的积极性。
    第三、捐献一定要坚持自觉自愿的原则，防止任何强迫摊派或变相强迫摊派现象的发生。推行增加生产、捐献武器运动的目的，不但是要加强支援前线、加强经济建设，而且是要拿这个运动来教育群众，在政治上提高群众。如果允许强迫摊派或变相的强迫摊派，就会不能教育群众，反而造成我们政治上的损失。但是这并不是说不要宣传增产捐献；而是说，在动员群众增产捐献时，必须充分说明增产捐献的意义，说明抗美援朝人人有责的道理，从而使人民群众都能自愿地积极地增加生产捐献武器；并且使群众经过增产捐献的爱国行动，更加提高自己的政治觉悟和革命积极性。
