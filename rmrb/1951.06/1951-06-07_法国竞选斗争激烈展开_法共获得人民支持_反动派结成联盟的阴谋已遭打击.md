　　French Election Struggle Intensifies
    French Communist Party Gains Popular Support
    Plot by Reactionaries to Form Alliance Thwarted
    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] Paris dispatch: As the French parliamentary elections, scheduled for June 17th, draw nearer day by day, the election struggle between the French democratic forces and the French reactionaries has reached an extremely acute stage. Developments so far have proven that the French reactionaries' plot to defeat the French Communist Party in this election is encountering significant difficulties. The French people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have effectively struck a blow against the reactionary parties' plot to openly form a unified election alliance.

    When the French reactionaries forcibly passed the anti-democratic "majority representation" electoral law in May, their aim was to form a unified election alliance nationwide, from the Socialist Party to the Gaullist faction, in order to concentrate all their efforts on obtaining a majority of votes and exclude the Communist Party from parliament. However, the French Communist Party promptly and convincingly exposed the aim of this plot, which was to enable De Gaulle to establish a fascist dictatorship in France. With the help of the Communist Party, many voters who, until now, were still under the influence of the so-called "Third Force" parties, such as the Popular Republican Movement, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, are rapidly recognizing the danger of France heading towards fascism. They rose up in opposition to the leadership organs of these parties and declared that they would never vote for the De Gaulle faction, and if the "Third Force" parties were to ally with De Gaulle, they would vote for the Communist Party. Under these circumstances, by the final deadline for registering candidate lists on May 25th, the French reactionary parties were unable to form a nationwide election alliance.

    This failure of the French reactionaries has caused the reactionary newspapers in Paris to constantly wail. On May 24th, "Le Parisien Libéré" admitted that the French reactionaries "firstly lack quantity, and secondly, cooperation... No matter how urgent the need, unity is currently impossible. The electoral law they passed cannot help them achieve their goals." On May 29th, "Le Figaro" said: "What is now making everyone feel uneasy is whether the new parliament can be controlled. People have not yet made the machine reach the point where it will not reverse." On the same day, "L'Aurore" more gloomily stated: If the reactionary parties "refuse to share responsibility and refuse to reconcile, then striking at the Communist Party will not be an easy task."

    Now, under the command of their American masters, the French reactionary parties are trying their best to put together various local alliances in various constituencies under the guise of various fancy signboards. In order to deceive voters, many Gaullists even shamelessly participate in the election as so-called "independents" and ally with the "Third Force" and "Fourth Force." Thus, the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Socialist Party, which are known as the "Third Force," have formed so-called "expanded Third Force" election alliances with these so-called "independents" in thirty-six constituencies. In another twelve constituencies, the representatives of the "Third Force" even openly formed alliances with the "Rally of the French People."

    In the election, the French reactionaries have exhausted all卑鄙 (bēi bǐ - base, contemptible) means. They are using terrorist tactics against the Communist Party's election activities. They throw bombs at Communist Party campaign rally venues, and they use police to suppress Communist Party activities. They confiscate Communist Party campaign propaganda; but they themselves have started up all the propaganda machinery, wantonly slandering the Communist Party. In order to deceive the people, they also hypocritically announced that taxes would be levied after the general election. The reactionary newspapers openly clamor that they must do everything possible to achieve the goal of driving the Communist Party out of parliament.

    However, more and more French people have recognized the base features of the French reactionaries. During the recent election trip to North Africa by the fascist head De Gaulle, although the authorities were heavily guarded, massive anti-De Gaulle movements broke out everywhere in Oran, Algiers, Constantine, and other places. People from all walks of life in cities and villages throughout France are enthusiastically responding to the call of the French Communist Party, and are increasingly actively organizing and participating in the protection of the universal suffrage committees and election committees. The campaign fund-raising movement initiated by the French Communist Party has achieved unprecedented success. The Communist Party's election campaign, with the support of the broad masses of the people, is unfolding vigorously. Zhukov, the correspondent of the Soviet "Pravda" in Paris, pointed out: The French patriots, resistance movement fighters, and anti-fascist fighters are united around the Republican anti-fascist resistance alliance led by the Communist Party, and are moving forward with confidence. No evil conspiracy can take away the people's trust gained by this alliance.

### 法国竞选斗争激烈展开  法共获得人民支持  反动派结成联盟的阴谋已遭打击

　　法国竞选斗争激烈展开
    法共获得人民支持         
    反动派结成联盟的阴谋已遭打击
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎消息：预定在六月十七日举行的法国议会选举一天天迫近，法国民主力量与法国反动派之间的竞选斗争已达到了十分尖锐的程度。到现在为止的种种发展证明：法国反动派企图在这次选举中击败法国共产党的阴谋正遭到重大的困难。在共产党领导下的法国人民已经有力地打击了各反动党派公开结成统一的竞选联盟的阴谋。
    当法国反动派在五月间强迫议会通过反民主的“多数代表制”的选举法时，他们的目的是企图在全国范围内组成从社会党到戴高乐派的统一竞选联盟，以便集中全力来取得多数选票，好把共产党从议会中排除出去。但是，法国共产党及时而且令人信服地揭穿了这个要使戴高乐在法国建立法西斯独裁政权的阴谋的目的。靠着共产党的帮助，许多到现在为止还在人民共和党、社会党、激进社会党等所谓“第三种力量”影响下的广大选民，正迅速地认识到法国走向法西斯的危险，他们群起反对这些政党的领导机关，并宣布决不投戴高乐分子的票，如果“第三种力量”各党要与戴高乐联盟的话，他们就投共产党的票。在这种情况下，到登记候选名单的最后限期五月二十五日止，法国各反动党派竟没有能够结成全国性的竞选联盟。
    法国反动派的这个失败，使得巴黎反动报纸不断发出哀号。《自由巴黎报》五月二十四日承认，法国反动派“首先缺乏的是数量，其次是合作。……不管需要如何迫切，目前团结已不可能。他们所通过的选举法并不能帮助他们实现目的”。五月二十九日《费加罗报》说：“现在使每个人感觉不安的就是新议会是否能控制。人们还没有使机器达到不反转来的程度。”同日的《震旦报》更暗淡地表示：如果各反动政党“拒绝分担责任、拒绝调和的话，打击共产党将不是一件容易的事”。
    现在，法国各反动党派在美国主子的指挥下，正在五花八门的招牌的掩饰下，在各个选区尽量拼凑各种地方性联盟。为了欺蒙选民，许多戴高乐分子甚至无耻地以所谓“独立分子”的身份参加竞选，而和“第三种力量”、“第四种力量”结盟。这样，号称“第三种力量”的社会党、人民共和党、激进社会党，已经和这种所谓“独立分子”在三十六个选区里结成所谓“扩大的第三种力量”式的竞选联盟。在另外十二个选区里，“第三种力量”的代表甚至公开和“法兰西人民联盟”结成了联盟。
    在竞选中，法国反动派用尽了一切卑鄙的手段。他们对共产党的竞选活动施行恐怖手段。他们向共产党的竞选大会会场投掷炸弹，他们用警察镇压共产党的活动。他们没收共产党的竞选宣传品；而自己却开动了全部宣传机器，对共产党咨意侮蔑。为了欺骗人民，他们还假惺惺地宣布延至大选后再行征税。各反动报纸公然叫嚣一定要尽全力达到把共产党逐出议会的目的。
    但是，愈来愈多的法国人民已经认清法国反动派的卑劣面目。在法西斯头子戴高乐最近到北非作竞选旅行时，虽然当局戒备森严，但在阿兰、阿尔及尔、君士坦丁等地到处爆发了声势浩大的反戴高乐运动。法国各地城乡的各阶层人民，热烈响应法国共产党的号召，越来越踊跃地组织并参加保护普选委员会和选举委员会。法共发起的竞选基金募捐运动，已经获得了空前的成就。法共的竞选运动，在广大人民支持之下，正在如火如荼地展开。苏联《真理报》驻巴黎记者朱可夫指出：法国的爱国志士、抵抗运动分子和反法西斯战士，都团结在共产党领导的共和反法西斯抵抗联盟周围，满怀信心向前迈进。任何邪恶的阴谋，都不能把这个联盟所得到的人民的信任夺去。
