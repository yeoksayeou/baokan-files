　　Guarantee the Successful Completion of Cotton Purchase and Storage Tasks
    The CCP Central Committee Instructs Party Committees at All Levels

    Comrades of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels:

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Cotton Purchase and Storage Work" on June 1st. The CCP Central Committee believes that the Government Administration Council's instructions are very important. In order to guarantee the supply of raw cotton for the national machine textile industry before the new cotton is on the market this year, and to appropriately meet the clothing needs of the military and civilians throughout the country, it is required that Party committees at all levels immediately mobilize all Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cooperative members in cotton-producing areas to promote a patriotic cotton selling and storage movement to Resist America and Aid Korea through their exemplary roles, striving to sell all the cotton currently stored by cotton farmers to the state at prices favorable to cotton farmers as stipulated by the state, or to store it with the government-entrusted cotton yarn and cloth companies, the People's Bank, and cooperatives, to ensure the successful completion of the national cotton purchase and storage tasks.

                                The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, June 1st
