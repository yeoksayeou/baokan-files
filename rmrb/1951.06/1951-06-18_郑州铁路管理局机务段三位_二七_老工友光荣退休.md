    To the Editor:
    Wang Tingdong, a 73-year-old veteran worker from the Boiler Team of the First Repair Shop of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot, Luo Xiting, a 72-year-old veteran worker from the Motor Group, and Li Jiazhen, a 63-year-old veteran worker from the Material Section, all participated in the "February 7th" revolutionary movement. Now, all three have retired honorably. The locomotive depot held a farewell party for the three veteran workers. More than 500 employees presented golden plaques with inscriptions such as "Fruits of Labor" and "Labor is Glorious," as well as various colorful banners. The three veteran workers wore red flowers and sat smiling in the center of the venue. Veteran worker Li Jiazhen said, "Today we are doubly happy and doubly delighted. Since we have the good leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our happy events have become more and more numerous!" Representatives congratulated the three veteran workers one after another. After the meeting, the three veteran workers got into a car decorated with colorful silks. In front of the car was an excited waist drum team, and behind the car was a farewell procession of more than 500 people. The Chinese people have won victory, and these three veteran workers have obtained such glorious and happy retirement.

    郑州铁路管理局机务段甲检锅炉班七十三岁的老工友王庭栋，电机组七十二岁的老工友罗玺廷，材料股六十三岁的老工友李家珍，都曾参加过“二七”革命运动。现在，三个人都光荣退休了。机务段给三位老工人举行了一个欢送大会。五百多职工送来写着“劳动果实”、“劳动光荣”等字样的金字大匾和各种彩色的锦旗。三位老工友佩带了红花，笑迷迷地坐在会场中央。老工友李家珍说：“今天我们是高兴加高兴，喜欢加喜欢。自从有了毛主席和共产党的好领导，咱们的喜事就越来越多啦！”代表们纷纷祝贺三位老工友。会后，三位老工友坐上了扎满彩绸的汽车。汽车前边是兴高采烈的腰鼓队，汽车后边是五百多人的欢送行列。中国人民胜利了，这三位老工友得到了这样光荣幸福的退休。
