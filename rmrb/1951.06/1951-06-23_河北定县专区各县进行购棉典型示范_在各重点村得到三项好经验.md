The CCP Dingxian District Committee of Hebei Province, in order to carry out the cotton purchase and storage movement, instructed the ten counties with the highest cotton production, including Lixian, Boye, Anguo, Wuji, and Dingxian, to select one or two key villages each to conduct cotton sale and storage demonstrations on June 2nd. Subsequently, two working groups were organized to provide specific guidance and assistance to Beizhu Village in Dingxian County and Xinxing Village in Lixian County. Now, the demonstration work has concluded one after another. Boye, Dingxian, Shenze and Anguo have achieved the best results, and cotton farmers are happily selling or storing their cotton with the state. In Boye County, cotton farmers in Zhangyue Village voluntarily sold 12,000 jin of cotton to the state in two days. Cotton farmers in Beizhu Village, Dingxian County, sold all the cotton they used for weaving and spinning to the state. The experiences gained during the demonstrations in key villages are:

(1) Vigorously carry out patriotic propaganda and education among cotton farmers, thoroughly implement the spirit of the people's government's instructions on cotton purchase and storage, dispel cotton farmers' concerns, and mobilize cotton farmers to sell and store cotton. At the beginning of the work in each key village, it was discovered that cotton farmers had concerns such as being afraid of revealing their wealth, afraid of complicated storage procedures, and afraid of not being able to buy useful things after selling cotton. The working groups conducted widespread and in-depth publicity targeting these concerns of cotton farmers, further enhancing their patriotic enthusiasm. After three or four days of publicity in Beizhu Village, Dingxian County, the cotton farmers raised their awareness, and selling cotton became a movement. Because Xinxing Village in Lixian County was eager for quick results and started mobilizing cotton farmers to sell cotton before the farmers' ideological awareness matured, the cotton farmers reported less cotton than they stored. Cadres in Beixiaowang Village, Boye County, had a purely task-oriented perspective, did not pay attention to publicity, and simply conducted household statistics, which made the cotton farmers confused and uneasy, and the task was not completed.

(2) Guarantee supply according to the needs of cotton farmers. During the demonstration in Dongzhang Village, Anguo, it was discovered that cotton farmers were willing to store physical goods and unwilling to store cash. The working group then put forward the slogan "Sell cotton to store bean cakes" (farmers in this village also have this habit), and as a result, cotton farmers quickly sold cotton and bought more than 60,000 jin of bean cakes. In this way, the problem of sluggish sales of bean cakes was also solved. In order to appropriately supply cotton farmers with useful goods, the District Finance and Economic Committee has instructed coal construction companies to set up temporary supply stations in Anguo, specializing in supplying coal, grain, salt and other essential production and living necessities to cotton farmers in Anguo, Lixian, and Boye counties. The local cotton collection stations have also notified the grain and salt groups of various professional companies in each county to guarantee supply according to the needs of cotton farmers. Because it was convenient for cotton farmers in Xinxing Village, Lixian County, to buy coal, 124 cotton farmers sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton to the state in two days.

(3) Call on party members, members of the Youth League, and activists to take the lead, establish typical examples in a planned way, and continuously promote and encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses in selling cotton. Li Luomo, a cotton farmer in Beizhu Village, Dingxian County, sold all 100 jin of stored cotton to the state. The village's propaganda organizations then launched publicity with Li Luomo as a model of patriotic cotton sales, which was of great educational significance to the masses and created a boom in cotton sales.

　　河北定县专区各县进行购棉典型示范
    在各重点村得到三项好经验
    中共河北定县地委为开展购棉储棉运动，曾在六月二日指示蠡县、博野、安国、无极、定县等十个产棉最多的县份，各选一两个重点村，进行售棉储棉示范。接着组织了两个工作组，分头到定县北祝村、蠡县辛兴村，具体指导帮助。现在，示范工作已经先后结束。以博野、定县、深泽，安国成绩最好，棉农都愉快地把存棉卖给或存给国家。博野县张岳村棉农在两天中，自动把一万二千斤棉花卖给了国家。定县北祝村棉农把织布纺线的棉花全都卖给了国家。在重点村示范时得到的经验是：
    （一）大力向棉农进行爱国主义宣传教育，深入贯彻人民政府购棉储棉的指示精神，打破棉农顾虑，动员棉农卖棉存棉。各重点村在开始工作时，发现棉农有怕露富、怕储存手续麻烦、怕卖出棉花买不到用的东西等顾虑。工作组便针对棉农这些顾虑进行了普遍深入的宣传，进一步提高棉农爱国热情。定县北祝村宣传了三、四天以后，棉农提高了觉悟，卖棉成了运动。蠡县辛兴村因为急于求成，没等农民思想觉悟成熟，便开始发动棉农卖棉，结果棉农存多报少。博野北小王村干部存有单纯任务观点，不注意宣传，简单地挨户统计，闹的棉农不知道怎么回事，心中不安，任务也没有完成。
    （二）根据棉农需要，保证供给。安国东张庄示范时发现棉农有愿意存实物，不愿意存现款的思想。工作组便提出“卖棉花存豆饼”的口号（这村农民也有这个习惯），结果棉农们便很快卖了棉花，买豆饼六万多斤。这样，豆饼滞销的问题也解决了。专区财政经济委员会为适当供给棉农用的东西，已指示煤建公司等在安国设立临时供应站，专供给安国、蠡县、博野等县棉农的煤、粮食、食盐等生产生活必需品。各地收棉站也根据棉农需要，通知各专业公司在各县的粮食小组和食盐小组保证供给。蠡县辛兴村的棉农因为买煤方便了，两天便有一百二十四户棉农把一万多斤棉花卖给了国家。
    （三）号召党员、团员、积极分子带头，有计划地树立典型，不断地发扬、鼓励群众的卖棉爱国热情。定县北祝村棉农李洛墨把存棉一百斤都卖给国家，村里各宣传组织便以李洛墨为卖棉爱国模范展开宣传，这样对群众教育意义很大，造成了卖棉热潮。
