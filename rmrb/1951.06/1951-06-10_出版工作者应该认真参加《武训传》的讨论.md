Publishing workers should enthusiastically respond to the call of the People's Daily editorial, actively participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," and strive to improve their political and ideological level and the quality of publications in this discussion.

Our publishing industry has published several harmful books promoting Wu Xun. These include film scripts, comic books, chapter novels, and biographies. These books lavish praise on Wu Xun, a loyal slave of the feudal rulers, lauding him as an "outstanding representative of the working people," a "personification of diligence, bravery, and wisdom," and even a man who "lived for the proletariat and died for the proletariat." We not only failed to expose and criticize these books that slander the peasant revolutionary struggle, slander Chinese history, and slander the Chinese nation in a timely manner, but also recommended them, which shows that we lack basic political vigilance and have a low level of ideological understanding, and we should seriously examine ourselves.

Participating in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is an effective way to improve our political level.

In the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," we can improve our political understanding and distinguish between what is revolutionary and what is counter-revolutionary. In China's history of the past century, what is revolutionary and what is counter-revolutionary? All those who oppose imperialism, oppose feudal forces, and promote the Chinese people's liberation movement are called revolutionary; conversely, they are called counter-revolutionary. From the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," we can see the watershed between revolution and counter-revolution. The root cause of the mistakes made by many people on the Wu Xun issue lies in the blurring of the line between revolution and counter-revolution.

In the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," we can learn how to use correct thinking methods and learn to distinguish between what is essential and what is superficial. In understanding Wu Xun, many people distorted and emasculated the essential things, exaggerated and embellished the superficial things, and thus regarded the slaves of the feudal rulers as "outstanding representatives of the working people."

In the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun," we can learn to master the criteria for judging historical figures. When evaluating the historical status of historical figures, should we base it on fragmentary materials from his private life, or on the impact of his behavior and thoughts on society? The criticism of Wu Xun's life is a touchstone. Whoever grasps historical materialism will grasp the truth, and whoever forgets historical materialism will only become a prisoner of feudal thought.

Participating in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is of decisive significance for future publishing work. If the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is thoroughly learned, the ideological level of our future publications will be improved.

　　出版工作者应该认真参加《武训传》的讨论
    我们出版工作者应该热烈响应人民日报社论的号召，积极参加《武训传》的讨论，并且要在这个讨论中达到提高政治思想水平，改进出版物质量的目的。
    我们的出版界曾经出版了若干种宣传武训的有害的书籍。其中有电影剧本、有连环图画、有章回小说、有传记。这些书籍中对于封建统治者的忠实奴才武训备极赞扬，誉之为“劳动人民的优秀代表”，誉之为“勤劳、勇敢、智慧的化身”，甚至誉之为“为无产阶级而生，为无产阶级而死”。我们对于这种污蔑农民革命斗争、污蔑中国历史、污蔑中国民族的书籍，不但没有及时加以揭露，加以批判，而且还曾加以推荐，足见我们没有起码的政治警觉性，思想水平太低，应当认真检讨。
    参加《武训传》的讨论，正是提高我们的政治水平的一个有效方法。
    在《武训传》的讨论中，可以提高我们的政治认识，可以使我们辨别什么是革命，什么是反革命。在中国近百年史中，什么是革命，什么是反革命呢？凡是反对帝国主义，反对封建势力，推动中国人民解放运动的，就叫做革命；反之，就叫做反革命。从《武训传》的讨论中，我们可以看到革命与反革命的分水岭。许多人在武训问题上所犯的错误，其根源就在于混淆了革命与反革命的界限。
    在《武训传》的讨论中，可以学习如何运用正确的思想方法，可以使我们学会区别什么是本质的东西，什么是假象的东西。在对于武训的认识上，不少人把本质的东西曲解阉割，把假象的东西夸大粉饰，因而把封建统治者的奴才当作“劳动人民的优秀代表”。
    在《武训传》的讨论中，可以使我们学习掌握评判历史人物的尺度。对于历史人物，在评判他的历史地位时，是根据他的私生活中的片段材料呢，还是根据他的行为与思想所给予社会的影响呢？对武训生平的批判是一块试金石，谁掌握了历史唯物论谁就能掌握住真理，谁忘记了历史唯物论，谁就只能做封建思想的俘虏。
    参加《武训传》的讨论，对于今后的出版工作是有决定的意义的，《武训传》的讨论如果学得彻底，我们今后出版物的思想水平便能提高一步。
