Another Batch of Bad Little Dictionaries

    In the last issue, this publication comprehensively criticized five popular small dictionaries. According to reader feedback, the following small dictionaries are also bad:

    I. "Student's Four-Purpose Dictionary," compiled by Wang Zhiming and republished in March 1951 by Beijing Wanhe Juji Bookstore. This is also an old book reprinted with many political errors. (Letter from Wu Yu of Beijing)

    II. "Standard National Pronunciation Student's New Dictionary" and "Latest National Pronunciation Student's Dictionary," compiled by Ran Mingda and published by Beijing Wenda Bookstore. The two books have exactly the same content and are actually the same book, with very outdated material. Even more absurdly, the copyright page of the "Student's Dictionary" states "First Edition, 1944," "Seventh Edition, 1950," while the "Student's New Dictionary" states "First Edition, 1951," "Fourth Edition, 1951." This kind of behavior of deceiving readers should be denounced. (Letter from Yu Zaichun of Beijing)

    III. "Five-Purpose Popular Dictionary," compiled by Zhang Gongmin and published by Beijing Yichang Bookstore in September 1950. The ideological, political, and technical errors are very serious. (Letter from Cui Shicheng of Xiangling, Shanxi) Note: This dictionary was criticized in the second issue of Guangming Daily's "Reading and Publishing" (November 25, 1950), and the publisher made a self-criticism, stating that they were "recovering and revising the books in the market." This letter from Cui is the most recent we've received. The so-called "recovering and revising" may just be empty words, and this dishonest and bad style should also be corrected.

    Many military cadres, county and district cadres, and primary school teachers have successively criticized and questioned the Beijing Bookstore edition of "Youth Five-Purpose Dictionary," the Shanghai Hongwen Bookstore edition of "New Terminology Learning Dictionary," the Shanghai Changfeng Bookstore edition of "New Terminology Handbook," and the Shanghai Chunming Bookstore edition of "New Terminology Dictionary," and explained that these books are very popular in the military and in counties and districts. Some of these dictionaries have been criticized in the "Book Review" section of this newspaper's supplement, and some have been criticized in other book review publications. The root cause of these dictionary errors is the insufficient ideological and political level of the compilers. The reason why these bad dictionaries can be sold everywhere is that the vast number of readers urgently need a dictionary or lexicon that meets current needs. We hope that such a dictionary or lexicon will appear in the near future.

　　另一批不好的小辞典
    本刊上期综合批评了五种通俗性的小辞典。根据读者反映，下列的几种小辞典也是不好的：
    一、王志鸣编、北京万聚合记书局一九五一年三月再版的“学生四用字典”。这也是旧书新印，里面有不少的政治错误。（北京吴雨来信）
    二、冉名达编、北京文达书局版“标准国音学生新字典”和“最新国音学生字典”，两本书内容完全相同，其实是一本书，材料很陈旧。更荒谬的是：在“学生字典”的版权页上注明“一九四四年初版”、“一九五○年七版”，而在“学生新字典”上却注明“一九五一、初版”、“一九五一、四版”，这种欺骗读者的行为应该受指斥。（北京余再春来信）
    三、张公民编、北京益昌书局一九五○年九月初版：“五用大众辞典”，思想性、政治性和技术性的错误都很严重。（山西襄陵崔世成来信）按：该辞典曾经光明日报《读书与出版》第二期（一九五○年十一月二十五日）提出批评，出版者并作了检讨，表示“正将市场存书收回修改”，崔君这封信是我们最近收到的。所谓“收回修改”，可能只是一句话，这种不老实的坏作风也应该改正。
    还有很多军队干部、县区干部和小学教师先后对北京书店版《青年五用辞典》，上海宏文书局版《新名词学习辞典》，上海长风书店版《新名词手册》，上海春明书店版《新名词辞典》等提出批评和责难，并说明这些书在军中和县区中都很流行。这些辞典有的已在前本报副刊“图书评论”上批评过了，有的已在其他书评刊物批评过。这些辞典错误的根源都是编著者思想政治水平的不够。这些坏辞典所以能够行销各地，是因为广大的读者迫切需要一本切合现在需要的字典或辞书。我们希望这样的字典或辞书能够在最近期间出现。
