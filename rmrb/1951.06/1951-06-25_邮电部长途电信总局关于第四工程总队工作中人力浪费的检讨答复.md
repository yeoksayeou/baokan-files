    Reply from the General Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Regarding the Review of Manpower Waste in the Fourth Engineering Brigade
    The People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Ma Chengnian on May 14 in the Readers' Letters column entitled "The Lack of Planning in the Work of the Fourth Engineering Brigade of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Leads to Serious Waste of Manpower." After forwarding it to the brigade for review, it was found that the issue involved leadership and coordination with other departments. In order to clarify the responsibility for this fact more clearly, we conducted a broader and more in-depth inspection. In addition to publishing the inspection results in the "Posts and Telecommunications Gazette" to educate the staff, we also provide the following public response:
    The Central and Southern Post and Telecommunications Administration was handling a certain line addition project. Because there were not enough people to dispatch, the General Telecommunications Bureau decided to transfer a team from the Second Engineering Brigade to assist. This notification was issued on February 13, and the Second Brigade was asked to send a captain to Hankou first to discuss preparations. After receiving this notification, the Central and Southern Post and Telecommunications Administration arranged for the team to be placed under the command of the Fourth Engineering Brigade. The Second Brigade staff arrived in the construction area on March 3. However, the materials were not completely resolved at that time. They waited for more than a month before starting work on April 14 and 20, respectively. According to regulations, even if an engineering team cannot start work after leaving its original location, it is still paid waiting pay. Therefore, in terms of waiting pay, nearly 8 million yuan was wasted. If wages are included, it will be more than double that amount, which is a considerable sum.
    The main reason for the waste was that the project could not start on schedule. After inspection, it was found that the reasons for not starting on schedule were: (1) Insufficient preparation beforehand. The Central and Southern Post and Telecommunications Administration's subjective efforts in the actual preparation work for this project were insufficient. For example, not all equipment could be shipped and arrive according to the planned time during transportation, and some items were left at the station for a long time. (2) Poor coordination and communication. The Second Brigade received a telegram from the Central and Southern Post and Telecommunications Administration urging them to go to the construction area. Although they found that the timing was incorrect, they did not inquire by telephone first, but went ahead anyway, which led to the mistake. (3) Some minor technical details were resolved relatively late. The General Telecommunications Bureau issued instructions on the technical methods for the entire project on February 3, but did not think of all possible situations, so that when the Fourth Brigade found situations outside of the instructions, they could not resolve them themselves, and had to repeatedly ask for instructions, which were not fully resolved until March 27. (4) There were also problems with the allocation of tools and materials. The Fourth Brigade originally thought that the people sent by the Second Brigade would bring all the tools (which is stipulated by the General Telecommunications Bureau). But in fact, what they brought was not enough, and some needed to be added. They had to temporarily transfer some from their own team, which delayed some time.
    Due to the above reasons, the project was delayed. These series of facts reveal many shortcomings, such as: the existence of an excessive reliance on subordinates, serious bureaucratic formalism, carelessness in handling affairs; insufficient thoroughness in the instructions of superiors; and insufficient coordination and cooperation between departments, etc. These are all worthy of deep reflection and vigorous improvement by this bureau and relevant parties.

### 邮电部长途电信总局关于第四工程总队工作中人力浪费的检讨答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    邮电部长途电信总局关于第四工程总队工作中人力浪费的检讨答复
    五月十四日人民日报读者来信栏刊登了马成年同志《邮电部第四工程总队工作无计划造成人力上的严重浪费》一信，经转知该总队检讨结果，发现牵涉到领导上和其他部门配合上的问题。为了使这一事实责任，搞得更明确一些，我们再进行了广泛和深入的检查。除检查结果刊载《邮电公报》对工作人员进行教育外，并作公开答复如下：
    中南邮电管理局办理的某一加线工程，因为人手不敷调度，经长途电信总局决定由第二工程总队抽调一个队前往协助，于二月十三日发出这个通知，并叫二总队先派队长往汉口接洽筹备。中南邮电管理局在接得这个通知后，曾经布置将该队拨交第四工程总队指挥。三月三日二总队工作人员即到施工地区。但当时材料还没有完全解决。待工了一个多月，到四月十四和二十日才分别开工。按照规定：工程队离开原驻地后，即使不能开工，也是支给候工费的。因此在候工费上讲，浪费了几乎八百万元，如果连工资计算，还要加上一倍多，是一笔相当大的数目。
    造成浪费的主要原因，是工程不能如期开工。经检查发现不能如期开工的原因有：（一）事前的准备不够。中南邮电管理局对这一个工程的实际筹备工作，主观努力是不够的，如运输过程中一切器材不能照计划的时间运出和运到，有的东西搁在车站上很久。（二）配合联系都很差。二总队收到中南邮电管理局电报，催他们前往施工地区，虽然发现了时间不对，但也没先用电话询问一下，就全部前往，以至将错就错。（三）工程技术上有若干小节解决的较迟。整个工程的技术方法，长途电信总局在二月三日就有指示，但没有把一切可能发生的情况都想到，以至四总队发现有指示以外的情况，不能自行解决，往返请示，到三月二十七日才完全解决。（四）工具和材料调拨上也有问题。四总队原来以为二总队派来的人一定把全部工具都带来（这是长途电信总局规定的）。但实际上带来的还不够用，需要补充一些，只得临时从自己队上抽调，耽误些时间。
    由于以上原因，使工程发生了延误。从这些一连串的事实中表现出许多缺点，如：存在着过份依赖下级的心理，严重的公文旅行情况，办事疏忽大意；上级指示不够周密；以及各部门间的联系配合不够等等。这都是值得本局和有关方面深刻检讨并努力改进的。
