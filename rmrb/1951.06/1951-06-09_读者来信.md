　　Those Willing to Donate Food to the Volunteers
　　Can Donate Cash for Centralized Purchasing
　　Editor:
　　In response to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's question, Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, mentioned the needs of the volunteers, including a large amount of nutritious food: pork floss, beef jerky, liver products, canned lard, and various compressed dry rations.
　　When our labor union group discussed how to donate these foods, we decided that for simplicity and to better suit the needs of the volunteers, we would no longer donate individual food items but directly donate cash for the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters to purchase them centrally. We do this also to prevent spies from taking advantage of the situation; in some places—such as Zunyi County, Guizhou—incidents of spies poisoning have been discovered, which should indeed draw our attention.
　　Now that a vigorous donation campaign has been launched across the country, we would like to offer our opinion to comrades who are preparing to donate food for reference.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Labor Union Group, Financial Management Department, Head Office of the People's Bank of China
　　Editor's Note: This is a very good suggestion. Donating individual food items is not only inconvenient for storage and transportation but also difficult to fully meet the needs of the volunteers. People from all walks of life who wish to donate food can follow this suggestion and directly donate cash to relevant agencies for unified purchase.
　　
　　The Counter-Revolutionary Zhang Zhenkai Was Shot
　　Mentougou Miners Celebrate Their "Second Emancipation"
　　Editor:
　　Zhang Zhenkai, the big foreman of the Mentougou Coal Mine in the western Beijing mining area, was shot on May 22nd. The mine's workers are celebrating their "second emancipation."
　　Zhang Zhenkai had run five contracting teams in the mine. He used to collude with British imperialist elements and became the director of the electromechanical group. He oppressed and exploited workers for twenty-five years, never caring about their lives. On his No. 4 team, fifteen workers were once crushed to death at once, and he said, "Not many!" Once, when Nan Shimen flooded, he closed the floodgates to save his water pump, trapping more than one hundred workers inside. He said, "Stinking workers are not worth as much as my water pump!" As a result, two workers drowned. During the "Fifth Public Security Enhancement Movement" of the Japanese puppet regime, workers earned only one jin of cornmeal a day, and people starved to death on the river滩 every day, but he was still utterly heartless. Several times he deducted the entire day's wages of all workers to send gold seals to the Japanese Captain 佐野 (Sano) and erect a monument of merit for the mother of the 任县 (Ren County) traitorous police chief. During the Kuomintang bandit regime, he colluded with landlords and bullies to establish the "Ren County Fellow Villagers Association in Ping (Beijing)," deducting workers' hard-earned money to recruit soldiers and horses for the home-returning legions to attack the liberated areas. His methods of exploiting workers were all-pervasive. He deducted workers' coal, embezzled workers' quotas, gave four mao instead of one yuan when paying wages, and charged one yuan for a loan of nine mao at high interest. With the money he embezzled and exploited, he opened three cloth shops, two rice shops, three hardware stores, and a rubber shoe store. The shoes workers wore, the hardware equipment used in the factory, silk, and cloth had to be bought from his shops. Workers had to grind flour at his shop, and his flour weighed fourteen liang per jin. Countless workers starved to death on the river滩, and his grain store raised ten big fat pigs with the grain he exploited.
　　After liberation, Zhang Zhenkai continued to be an enemy of the people. He concealed his identity as a Kuomintang member, privately hid four guns, continued to oppress workers as usual, and opposed the People's Government. Many workers were so happy to hear that Zhang Zhenkai was to be shot that they couldn't sleep all night. After he was shot, the workers held a celebration meeting that night. The mine director, staff, and workers, including his nephews, unanimously stated in their speeches that this big foreman who ate workers' flesh and drank workers' blood should have died long ago. The staff and workers spent only two hours creating comic dialogues, clapperdash, drum ballads, etc., vividly depicting his ferocious appearance when he was domineering and oppressing workers. In the past, Zhang Zhenkai often sowed discord between electromechanical workers and coal miners, provoking them to fight in groups at every turn. At this celebration meeting, coal miner Bo Delu enthusiastically hugged an electromechanical worker and said, "We are originally one family. The big foreman used to play tricks on us. Now that he is dead, we must be more affectionate and work hard to produce."
　　Last year, when Zhang Zhenkai was arrested, many workers still had concerns, fearing that he would retaliate after being "leniently" released. Now, the People's Government has shot him. The workers said, "This time, the big foreman can't come back." At the celebration meeting, on the wall newspapers, and in the cartoons, the staff and workers pledged one after another: the stumbling block has been removed, and we must work hard to produce and study well; otherwise, we will be unworthy of Chairman Mao.

　　Raise Vigilance and Strictly Prevent Landlord Counterattacks
　　Landlords in Baibiao Township, Deqing County, Dare to Kill the Director of the Farmers' Association
　　The County People's Court Sentenced the Main Culprits Yao Xingyuan and Others to Death
　　Editor:
　　An incident occurred in Baibiao Township, Xinxishi District, Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, where a local tyrant landlord killed the director of the farmers' association. After investigation by the public security organs of the People's Government and with the assistance of local peasants, the murderers were quickly arrested and sentenced to death after a public trial. Baibiao Township, Deqing County, is an area where land reform has just been implemented. The mobilization of the masses in the ninth village of the township was not sufficient, and the prestige of the landlords was not completely crushed. Although the land, farm tools, and boats of the three landlord families of Yao Xingyuan, Yao Qingyuan, and Yao Zhiyuan were distributed during the land reform, they harbored resentment. They deliberately planned to kill Wang Alin, a peasant who had been very active in his work during the land reform and is now the director of the farmers' association. At 2 p.m. on April 13th this year, the three landlord elements Yao Xingyuan, Yao Qingyuan, and Yao Zhiyuan, together with Yao Bingchu (a member of the farmers' association, who had been captured by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War and whom Yao Xingyuan and others "guaranteed" back; the landlords used this to buy him over), Xu Zanwen (a teacher in the village), and Jiang Jinhu (a middle peasant), held a meeting at Yao Xingyuan's door and decided on the plan to murder Wang Alin. On the afternoon of April 16th, because it was raining and there was no one on the street, Jiang Jinhu called Wang Alin to Yao Xingyuan's thatched house. First, Yao Xingyuan pushed Wang Alin down and pinned him down, Xu Zanwen twisted his hair, Jiang Jinhu took two rice straw ropes and put them on Wang Alin's head, and Yao Qingyuan and Yao Zhiyuan pulled them tight to strangle him to death. Yao Zhiyuan then took the deceased's galoshes and made fake footprints on the mud outside.
　　Before the criminals were interrogated and confessed, the criminals' henchmen wrote anonymous letters of accusation, saying that Wang Alin was killed by Shi Azhang (a fugitive landlord). However, because our public security organs had grasped accurate materials on the case after detailed investigation, we immediately realized that this was a false accusation. After interrogation, the accusers also confessed their conspiracy.
　　On May 27th, a memorial service was held, and representatives from various townships brought wreaths, sacrificial offerings, and elegiac couplets to pay tribute to Comrade Wang Alin. The representatives of the masses also took the stage to give speeches, calling on peasant brothers not to be paralyzed, to be vigilant against the assassination of local tyrant landlords, and to assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
　　The County People's Court accepted the demands of the masses and held a public trial of the criminals on the spot. After the public trial, the main culprits in the murder case, Yao Qingyuan, Yao Xingyuan, Yao Zhiyuan, and Xu Zanwen, were all sentenced to death, and all property was confiscated, except for the portion left for their families to live on; the criminal Yao Bingchu was sentenced to death, but because he played a secondary role in the case, he was granted a two-year reprieve, forced labor, to see the effect. Jiang Jinhu, an accomplice, confessed first during the interrogation, which was conducive to solving the case, and was sentenced to five years in prison.
　　The accusers were also sentenced to prison terms.
　　The peasants were very happy to hear the sentencing and to see the criminals Yao Xingyuan, Yao Qingyuan, Yao Zhiyuan, and Xu Zanwen being taken to the execution ground and shot.

　　The Arrest and Execution of Zhang Quanbao
　　Can Be Made into a Movie and Attached to the Film "Liu Hulan"
　　Editor:
　　Seeing the news published in today's People's Daily that Zhang Quanbao, the murderer of Liu Hulan, has been arrested in Wanquan County, Shanxi Province, makes me extremely happy. This once again proves that all heinous counter-revolutionaries and executioners will eventually fall into the hands of the people and be punished by the people. To prove this point, I suggest that the arrest and execution of the murderer Zhang Quanbao be filmed and added to the end of the movie "Liu Hulan," so that the broad masses of the people can witness the end of this murderous executioner, to uphold justice and encourage our revolutionary aspirations.

　　Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions
　　Backward Merchants Pass Off Domestic Rice as "Saigon Rice"
　　Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce Has Banned It
　　Editor:
　　Regarding the problem reflected by Comrade Zheng Zhi in the "Reader's Letters Page" of the People's Daily on May 9th, that some rice stalls in Dongsi Archway were passing off domestic rice as "Saigon rice," we have conducted an inspection. The first to sell domestic rice as "Saigon rice" was the Zhenxingsheng Rice Shop on Chaoyangmen Inner Street. This business purchased and transported three batches of indica rice and oil paddy rice, a total of 814 packages, from Changsha starting in January of this year. After processing, it was wholesaled and retailed in the market. In the market, it was sold under its original name. In the store, in order to cater to the psychology of some customers, it was sold under the name of "Saigon rice." Nearby rice stalls then followed suit. It was not until May 3rd that the vendor management office of Chaoyangmen Inner Street stopped it.
　　Merchants selling domestic rice as foreign rice is basically the result of speculative thinking; selling counterfeit goods and deceiving customers is even more of an illegal act. Our market management office is nearby, but it failed to ban this improper business behavior in a timely manner, which shows that our leadership of market management work is insufficient. In the future, we will strengthen market management and education work to further eliminate speculative behavior in the market.

　　Linqing Town People's Government Public Security Bureau
　　Illegal Cadres Have Been Dealt With
　　Editor:
　　On May 21st, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published the criticism of the style of some public security cadres of the Linqing Town (originally mistakenly written as Linqing County) People's Government Public Security Bureau Waterfront Police Station by the Waterborne Sub-bureau Communication Group of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. This criticism is correct, and we sincerely accept it. Now, we will tell you about the handling of this matter.
　　The incident of public security personnel of the Linqing Town Waterfront Police Station violating laws and disciplines and bullying boat people occurred in December last year. At that time, we already knew about this situation. During the annual cadre appraisal at the end of last year, we made a summary inspection and dealt with the cadres concerned according to the severity of their mistakes: Feng Yueying, the head of the Waterfront Police Station, was ideologically backward, lived a corrupt life, indulged cadres without principle, and refused to obey organizational transfers, and has been removed from his post. Fang Zhenling (Communist Party member), the public security officer, had an extremely improper work style, was corrupt and degenerate, and lost his position and colluded with counter-revolutionaries. He has now been expelled from the Party; the government has also detained him and is currently dealing with him. Police officer Li Chunhai was dismissed for illegally beating people and bullying boat people.
　　Although this problem has been dealt with, we always take it as our lesson, so the report raising this problem is still helpful to us.

    愿向志愿军捐献食物者
    可捐现款以便统购编辑同志：
    中国人民赴朝慰问团廖承志团长在答新华社记者问中谈到志愿军目前的需要，其中有一条是需要具有丰富营养的大量食品：猪肉松、牛肉干、肝类、猪油罐头、各种压缩干粮等。
    我们工会小组在研究如何捐献这些食物的时候，讨论到为了简便，为了更适合于志愿军的需要，决定今后不再捐献零星食品，而直接捐献现金，由中国人民抗美援朝总会统一购制。我们这样做，也是为了避免特务钻空子；目前有的地方——如贵州遵义县发现了特务放毒的事件，这确是应引起我们注意的。
    现在各地已展开如火如荼的捐献运动，我们愿意将自己的一点意见提供准备捐献食物的同志们作参考。
                          中国人民银行总行金融管理处工会小组
     编者按：这个意见很好。捐献零星食物，既不便于保管运输，而且也难以完全适合志愿军需要，各界人民如有愿捐献食物者，可按照这个建议直接捐出现款委托有关机关统一购制即可。
        枪毙了反革命分子张振凯
        门头沟矿工欢庆“二次翻身”编辑同志：
    京西矿区门头沟煤矿的大把头张振凯，在五月二十二日被枪毙了，矿上的职工，庆祝他们的“第二次翻身。”
    张振凯在矿上开过五个包工柜。他从前勾结英国帝国主义分子，当上了机电组主任。他欺压剥削工人二十五年，从来不拿工人性命当回事。他的四号柜上，有一回一下砸死了十五个工人，他还说：“不多！”有一次南石门透水，他为了保存他的水泵，就关了水闸门，把一百多工人关在里面。他说：“臭工人没有我水泵值钱！”结果，工人淹死了两个。在日伪“五次治安强化运动”时期，工人一天才挣一斤棒子面钱，每天都有人饿死在河滩上，可是他还丧尽了天良，好几次克扣全体工人整天的工资，给日寇佐野小队长送金图章，给任县的汉奸警备队长的妈立功德碑。国民党匪帮统治时，他又纠合地主恶霸，成立“任县旅平同乡会”，克扣工人的血汗钱，给还乡团招兵买马，进攻解放区。他剥削工人的方法是无孔不入的，他扣发工人的煤；吃工人的空额；发工资时，该一块的给四毛；放高利贷时，借九毛算一块。他用贪污剥削来的钱，开了三个布店、两个米粮店、三个五金行、一个胶皮鞋店，工人穿的鞋、厂子里用的五金器材、绸子、布匹，都得到他的铺子里去买。工人磨面得上他的铺子去磨，他磨的面，十四两算一斤，无数的工人饿死在河滩上，他的粮食店用剥削来的粮食养了十条大肥猪。
    张振凯在解放以后继续与人民为敌。他隐瞒了国民党党员的身份，私藏了四枝枪，照常欺压工人，和人民政府作对。很多工人听说要枪毙张振凯，高兴得一夜没睡。枪毙他以后，工人们当天晚上就开了庆祝会。矿长、职员、工人包括他的侄子在内，在讲话时，一致表示这个吃工人肉、喝工人血的大把头，早就该死。职工们只用两个钟头的工夫，就编出了相声、快板、大鼓等等，生动地描写他当初作威作福，欺压工人的凶像。以前，张振凯经常在机电工人和采煤工人之间挑拨是非，动不动就挑拨大伙儿打群架。在这个庆祝会上，采煤工人薄德禄，热烈地抱住机电工人说：“咱们原是一家人。大把头过去尽给咱们使坏，现在他死了，咱们得多多亲热，好好生产。”
    去年张振凯被捕时，很多工人还有顾虑，怕他被“宽大”出来以后再进行报复。现在，人民政府把他枪毙了。工人说：“这回大把头可回不来了。”在庆祝会上、在壁报上、在漫画上，职工们纷纷保证：绊脚石搬开了，咱们可得努力生产，好好学习，要不然可对不起毛主席。

            提高警惕严防地主反攻
            德清县白彪乡地主竟敢杀农会主任
            县人民法庭判处主犯姚杏元等死刑编辑同志：
    浙江省德清县新市区白彪乡曾发生恶霸地主杀害农会主任的事件。经过人民政府公安机关的侦察和当地农民的协助，凶手很快就被捕起来，并经过公审判处了死刑。德清县白彪乡是刚刚实行土地改革的地区，该乡第九村发动群众不够充分，地主的威风也没有彻底打垮，土地改革时地主姚杏元、姚庆元、姚芝元三家的田地、农具、船虽然都被分配了，但是他们却怀恨在心。他们并蓄意要将土地改革中工作表现得很积极、现在当了农会主任的农民王阿林杀掉。今年四月十三日下午二时姚杏元、姚庆元、姚芝元三个地主分子即同姚炳初（农会委员，抗战期间曾被日寇捕去，姚杏元等把他“保”回来了，地主们即利用这一点收买了他）、徐赞文（本村教员）、蒋金虎（一个中农）等六人，在姚杏元门口开会，决定好了谋杀王阿林的计策。四月十六日下午，因天下雨，街上无人，蒋金虎就将王阿林叫到姚杏元的草屋内，首先由姚杏元将王阿林推倒压住，徐赞文用手扭住头发，蒋金虎拿了二根稻草绳，套在王阿林头上，姚庆元、姚芝元拉紧缢死，将尸首吊在梁上，姚芝元又拿死者的套鞋从外边泥地上做好假脚印。
    在凶犯们没有被审讯招供前，凶犯的爪牙还写了匿名诬告信，说王阿林是被施阿掌（逃亡地主）杀害的。但因我们公安机关经过详细侦察，对该案已掌握了确实的材料，立即觉察这是诬告。经审讯后，诬告犯也都供认了自己的阴谋。
    五月二十七日，举行追悼大会，各乡群众的代表都拿了花圈、祭品、挽联，来祭奠王阿林同志，群众代表们并登台讲演，号召农民兄弟不要麻痹，要警惕恶霸地主的暗算，要协助政府坚决镇压反革命。
    县人民法庭接受了群众的要求，当场开庭公审罪犯。公审完毕，判决该案杀人主犯姚庆元、姚杏元、姚芝元、徐赞文等均处以死刑，所有财产，除留给其家属生活部分外，全部没收；凶犯姚炳初判处死刑，以其在该案中居于较次要地位，所以准予缓期二年执刑，强迫劳动，以观后效。从犯蒋金虎在审讯中首先坦白，有利于破案，判处有期徒刑五年。
    诬告者也分别判处了徒刑。
    农民们听了宣判，并看到把凶犯姚杏元、姚庆元、姚芝元、徐赞文等拉到刑场执行枪毙，非常高兴。
                                                苑宝芳、国静波
            张全宝就逮及伏法情况
            可拍成电影附入《刘胡兰》影片编辑同志：
    看到人民日报今天刊登的杀害刘胡兰的凶犯张全宝已在山西省万泉县就逮的消息，真使我高兴万分。这又一次证明了凡是一切罪大恶极的反革命分子和刽子手们迟早终会落到人民的手里，受到人民的制裁。为了证明这一道理，我建议将凶犯张全宝被捕以及处决的情形拍成电影，续在电影《刘胡兰》的后面，使广大人民都能目睹这个杀人刽子手的下场，以申张正义，鼓舞我们的革命志气。

        对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
        落后商人以本国米冒充“西贡米”
        北京市工商局已予取缔编辑同志：
    五月九日人民日报《读者来信专页》所载郑直同志反映东四牌楼有些米摊拿本国米冒充“西贡米”问题，我们已进行了检查。最先以国产米冒充“西贡米”出售的，是朝阳门内大街振兴生米庄。该商号在本年一月起，由长沙购运籼米及油稻谷三批，共八百一十四包，加工后在市场批发，也在门市零售，在市场上是按原品名出售的，在门市上，为了迎合一部分顾客的心理，就冒用“西贡米”的名义出售。附近粮摊随后就相效冒充。直到五月三日才经朝阳门内大街摊贩管理处制止。
    商贩们拿国产米冒充外国米出售，基本上是一种投机思想在作祟；出售冒牌货，欺骗顾客，更是一种非法行为。我们的市场管理处近在咫尺，竟未能即时取缔这种不正当的商业行为，正说明了我们对市场管理工作领导不够。今后我们当加强市场的管理和教育工作，进一步肃清市场上的投机行为。

            对违法干部已作处理编辑同志：
    五月二十一日人民日报《读者来信》栏发表了天津市人民政府公安局水上分局通讯组反映船民们对临清镇（原信误为临清县）人民政府公安局水上派出所某些公安干部作风的批评。这个批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。现在，我们将此事的处理情况告诉你们。
    临清镇水上派出所公安人员违犯法纪、欺压船民的事情，发生在去年十二月。当时我们已知道了这个情况。在去年年关干部鉴定时，我们就作了总结检查，对有关干部根据其错误大小作了处理：水上派出所所长冯月营，思想落后，生活腐化，无原则地纵容干部，且不服从组织调动，已被撤职。治安干事方振岭（共产党员），他的工作作风极不正派，贪污腐化，且丧失立场、勾通反革命分子。现党内给他开除党籍处分；政府并予以扣押，现正在处理中。警察李春海，违法打人、欺压船民，已被开除。
    这个问题虽然已经处理了，但我们时时作为自己的教训，因此报上提出这个问题，对我们仍然是有帮助的。
