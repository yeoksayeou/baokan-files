Wheat Prices Drop in Henan and Shandong

Grain Companies Arrange Wheat Purchases to Guarantee Reasonable Income for Farmers

New wheat has been entering the market successively in various parts of Henan Province. In the Huangchuan area, from May 22nd to June 5th, the amount of wheat entering the market reached 50,000 jin. Wheat has also been successively entering the market in the Huaiyang and Xinyang regions, but there are not many buyers, and the market is showing signs of sluggish sales, with wheat prices continuously declining. On June 1st, new wheat in Huaidian (under the jurisdiction of Shenqiu County) was only 448 yuan per jin, and on June 5th, new wheat in Huaiyang was only 550 yuan per jin. In Xiping, Suiping, Xincai, Zhengyang, Xihua, Luyi, and other places, wheat prices have fallen due to the increasing amount of new wheat entering the market and the limited number of transactions.

Now is just the beginning of the new wheat season, and if this trend continues, wheat prices are bound to fall further. In order to reverse this trend, the province's grain company convened a meeting of managers of various branch companies to arrange the purchase of wheat. It also required all branch companies to purchase wheat directly to ensure that farmers receive more real benefits. In remote production areas where there are no established institutions, mobile purchasing teams can be set up to solve the difficulties farmers face in selling grain. In terms of price, the principle of pricing according to quality should be implemented, with better prices for higher grades and lower prices for lower grades. In addition, all procedures should be simplified to facilitate both merchants and the people. Some regional companies have already begun purchasing.

This year's wheat harvest in Shandong Province is earlier than last year. In the Fengxian area under the jurisdiction of the Tengxian region, new wheat began to enter the market in late May. By early June, new wheat had successively entered the market in all areas of the province except for the Wendeng, Laiyang, and Jiaozhou regions. When new wheat first entered the market in Tai'an, the daily amount entering the market was about 100,000 jin, which has now increased to more than 200,000 jin. However, due to the grain company's insufficient preparation, it has failed to effectively carry out purchasing work, and some farmers have been unable to find buyers for their wheat, resulting in relatively low market prices for new wheat in most areas. This situation is particularly evident in early-maturing areas such as Tai'an and Xuzhou. For example, on June 11th, 240,000 jin of new wheat entered the market in Tai'an, but the grain company only purchased 120,000 jin. Due to the varying moisture content of the new wheat, the average purchase price was 640-650 yuan, which is relatively low. On June 11th, about 80,000 to 90,000 jin of new wheat entered the market in Xuzhou, but the grain company did not purchase any. In Taierzhuang near Xuzhou, new wheat prices once fell to 500 yuan per jin. In other places such as Yanzhou, Tengxian, and Jining, the amount of new wheat purchased by grain companies was very small, and the prices were also low. Near Dezhou, although the amount of new wheat entering the market was small, the price was better, with new wheat selling for about 960 yuan per jin on June 11th. In order to correct the phenomenon of low wheat prices in some areas, the Provincial Grain Company instructed its affiliated branch companies on June 11th to quickly organize forces and vigorously purchase wheat to protect the interests of farmers.

　　河南山东各地麦价下跌
    粮食公司布置购麦  保证农民合理收益
    河南省各地新麦陆续登市。潢川区从五月二十二日开始到六月五日，上市量已达五万斤。淮阳、信阳两专区小麦也已相继上市，但购主不多，市场呈现滞销状态，麦价连续下降。六月一日槐店（沈邱县属）新麦仅四百四十八元一斤，六月五日淮阳新麦仅五百五十元一斤。西平、遂平、新蔡、正阳、西华、鹿邑等地，都因新麦上市日益增多，交易寥寥，市价下挫。
    现在还是新麦上市的开始，若听其发展下去，麦价势必更跌。该省粮食公司为扭转这一趋势，特召开各分、支公司经理会议，布置收购小麦工作。并要求各分、支公司直接收购，使农民多得实惠。在还没有机构的偏僻产区，可设立流动收购组，解决农民卖粮困难。在价格上，贯彻以质定价方针，实行优级优价，低级低价。另外，还应简化一切手续，做到便商利民。部分地区公司，现已开始收购。
    山东今年小麦登市比去年早，滕县专区所辖丰县一带，五月下旬新麦就开始登市。至六月上旬，全省除文登、莱阳、胶州等专区外，其他地区新麦已陆续登市，泰安新麦刚登市时，每日上市量约十余万斤，现已增至二十余万斤。但因粮食公司准备不足，未能有效的开展收购工作，农民一部分小麦找不到售主，因而在大部地区新麦市价偏低，这种情况在泰安、徐州等新麦早熟地区尤为显著。如泰安十一日新麦上市二十四万斤，粮食公司仅收购十二万斤。由于新麦水分不同，收购的平均价格为六四○——六五○元，价格较低。徐州十一日登市新麦约八、九万斤，而粮食公司竟未收购。徐州附近台儿庄新麦曾一度跌至每斤五百余元。其他如兖州、滕县、济宁等地，粮食公司收购的上市新麦，数量很少，价格也低。德州附近，虽新麦上市量少，但价格较好，十一日新麦每斤约九六○元。为了纠正部分地区麦价偏低的现象，省粮食公司已于十一日指示所属分支公司迅速组织力量，大力收购，以保护农民利益。
