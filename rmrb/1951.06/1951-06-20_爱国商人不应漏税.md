Summary of Letters to the Editor:

　　Patriotic Businessmen Should Not Evade Taxes
    To the Editor:
    On the afternoon of June 3rd, I was eating at Tianfu Restaurant at 158 Longfusi Street, Dongsi Pailou, Beijing, and saw a man and a woman ordering wine and food. The food they ordered totaled more than 60,000 yuan. At that time, the restaurant owner told the customer, "If it exceeds 30,000 yuan, you have to pay 6,000 yuan in tax." However, later they tried to use personal connections to split the bill for the customer, so that the customer would pay less or no tax. The restaurant has already signed a patriotic pact, but is illegally evading taxes. This behavior is not something a patriotic businessman should do. I hope they will make a public self-criticism and correct themselves.

### 爱国商人不应漏税

专栏：来信摘要

　　爱国商人不应漏税编辑同志：
    六月三日下午，我在北京东四牌楼隆福寺街一五八号天福馆吃饭，见有一男一女同往该饭馆订酒菜。他们订的饭菜共计六万多元。当时饭馆主人向顾主说：“过三万元就得纳六千元税”，但是，后来他们就卖弄人情，给顾客分笔记账，使顾主少纳或不纳税了。该饭馆已经订立了爱国公约，而又非法漏税，这种行为不是爱国商人所应有的，希望他们公开检讨改正。
