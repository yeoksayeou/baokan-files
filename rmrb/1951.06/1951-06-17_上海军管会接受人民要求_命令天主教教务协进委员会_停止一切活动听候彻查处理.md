Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th—The Registration Office for Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving Foreign Subsidies and Operated with Foreign Capital under the Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has ordered the Catholic Educational Association at 179 Yueyang Road, Shanghai, to cease all activities and await handling by the People's Government.

　　The Catholic Educational Association is a reactionary organization directly led and commanded by the imperialist element, Libei Li. It harbored imperialist elements such as Tian Zhizhong (French), Hua Lizhu (American), Le Kang (Belgian), Zhao Yuming (Canadian), and Mo Keqin (Irish) to conduct conspiratorial activities, publish and distribute a large number of reactionary books and periodicals, slander and oppose the Chinese people and the People's Government, and oppose the patriotic Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement. In addition, it organized and led reactionary groups such as the Catholic Action Team and the Legion of Mary (also known as the Holy Mother's Army or Holy Mother's Group), attempting to be enemies of the Chinese people. These sinful conspiratorial activities, after being exposed by the people and patriotic Catholics in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, aroused the anger of the people across the country, who have been demanding that the government swiftly and severely punish them. The Registration Office for Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving Foreign Subsidies and Operated with Foreign Capital under the Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission accepted the people's demands and, in order to protect religious freedom from being exploited or undermined by imperialist elements, made a decision on thoroughly investigating the Catholic Educational Association. On the morning of June 6th, it summoned Hua Lizhu, Zhao Yuming, Le Kang, Shen Shixian (Chinese), and Chen Zhemin (Chinese), persons in charge of the Catholic Educational Association, to the office, announced the above decision to them, and ordered Hua Lizhu and others to cease all activities of the association immediately and await government summons for handling. The Registration Office has now dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate all activities and reactionary books and documents of the Catholic Educational Association, as well as the political situation of the responsible persons of the association, and will handle them separately according to the results of the thorough investigation.
