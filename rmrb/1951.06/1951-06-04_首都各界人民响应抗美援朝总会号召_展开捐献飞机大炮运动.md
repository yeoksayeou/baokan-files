　　People From All Circles in the Capital Respond to the Call of the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Launch a Movement to Donate Airplanes and Cannons
    [Reported by this newspaper] People from all circles in the capital have responded to the call of the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and have started a movement to donate airplanes and cannons. All the workers of the No. 3 Well of the Heishan Mine in the Jingxi Coal Mining Area proposed to produce one more can of coal per group per day and donate all the excess wages. They plan to donate a tank this year. The workers of the Tongde Kiln donated 300,000 yuan of the excess bonus earned in May; the workers of the Jingde Kiln donated all of their bonus of 1.3 million yuan. The amateur troupe of the Jianxin Coal Mine held a charity performance and donated 1 million yuan. Workers from a certain factory of the General Ordnance Bureau, the Beijing People's Printing Factory, and the Weiyi Flour Mill have all proposed to thoroughly implement the patriotic pact, increase production, and donate the increased income to buy airplanes and cannons.
    More than 11,000 farmers and other people in the suburbs of Beijing have successively listened to the reports of the representatives of the comfort mission to Korea in recent days. Everyone unanimously expressed their gratitude to the volunteers and stated that they would intensify the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and contribute all their strength to support the front. The masses in Mentougou Village in the 13th district, Chaoyang Street in the 10th district, and some rural areas have already started the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. Cui Yuyang, a farmer in the 14th district, said that he would work hard to produce one-tenth more grain and do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Farmers in the 16th district are also preparing to increase production and donate money.
    Teachers and students from the North China University of Technology, Beijing Finance and Economics School, Huiwen Middle School, Yuying Middle School, and Industry and Commerce Middle School have all launched donation campaigns. Seventeen returned overseas Chinese students from Tsinghua University donated a batch of medicines they brought back and jointly wrote a letter to overseas Chinese students across the country, hoping that everyone would unite and take practical actions to support the volunteers - our most beloved people.
    Zhang Tianyi, Deputy Director of the Central Institute of Literature, upon hearing that the institute had launched a donation for the "Lu Xun" airplane while recuperating from an illness, immediately responded to the call and donated 2 million yuan in royalties.
