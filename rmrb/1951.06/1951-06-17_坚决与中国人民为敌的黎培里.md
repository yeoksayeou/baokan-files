Li Peili, an imperialist element who has been jointly denounced by patriotic Catholics and the broad masses of people throughout the country, was the "envoy" of the Vatican to the Kuomintang reactionary government and the executor of the Vatican's interference in China's internal affairs. He controlled all dioceses in China and consistently issued orders to Chinese Catholics, using the Chinese church to oppose the Chinese people.

Li Peili came to China on December 14, 1946. At that time, supported by American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang had launched a large-scale war of aggression against the Chinese people. In order to cooperate with the Chiang bandit gang's massacre war, Li Peili, soon after arriving in China, went to various important regions to investigate the political situation under the guise of inspecting various dioceses, and arranged in the churches of these regions the forces and plans to cooperate with the Chiang bandit gang against the Chinese people. In order to further control the various dioceses of the Catholic Church in China and strengthen anti-communist and anti-people propaganda, he reorganized the Catholic Affairs Promotion Committee in 1947. Under the direct leadership of Li Peili, this organization became the center for imperialism to carry out all counter-revolutionary activities within the Catholic Church in China.

Li Peili's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was extremely close! On New Year's Day 1947, when Yu Bin, a degenerate among Chinese Catholics, held a ceremony to assume the position of Archbishop of Jiangsu Diocese, Li Peili attended and delivered a speech, openly declaring that the Catholic Church should assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "nation-building work." In February 1948, Li Peili convened a so-called National Catholic Education Conference in Shanghai. In addition to Catholic representatives, those attending this conference included Ying Qianli, the representative of the pseudo-Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, Wang Zhaoquan, the representative of the pseudo-Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Li Ximou, the pseudo-Shanghai Education Bureau Director, and former U.S. Embassy Secretary Melville, etc. Li Peili, who had always carried the banner of being "above politics," praised this shameless collusion as the "spirit of unity between politics and religion"; he further stated that the purpose of this conference was for "the church and the government (referring to the Chiang bandit gang) to cooperate" in order to "oppose communism." Shortly after the meeting, he returned to Nanjing to congratulate Chiang Kai-shek on assuming the position of "President," and he addressed this public enemy of the Chinese people with congratulations, saying: "Only the Pope of the Catholic Church and the President of the Republic of China represent the hopes and interests of the largest and most numerous human beings in the world."

The rapid development of the victorious situation of the Chinese People's Liberation War made imperialist elements like Li Peili extremely anxious. Li Peili used words such as "tragic," "serious," and "difficult" to slander the great victory of the Chinese people. In a letter he wrote to his secretary Chen Zhemin in February 1949, he said: "Today's China, due to the tragic situation, the possibility of the holy tradition (should be read as imperialist aggression) has been reduced to the lowest limit, and in many places it has disappeared." However, the imperialist elements are not reconciled to their failure in China. In this letter, Li Peili revealed his conspiracy to incite Chinese Catholics to be enemies of the entire Chinese people. He said: "The future situation may be more serious, requiring the complete and wholehearted cooperation of the faithful, so that the Kingdom of Christ (should be read as imperialist rule) in China will not only not suffer losses and decline, but will further develop and continue its sacred rights." In order to realize this conspiracy, Li Peili systematically carried out deployments: accelerating the development of the reactionary core organization of the Catholic Church—the Legion of Mary—in various places. In early 1949, Li Peili's secretary Chen Zhemin translated the "Legion of Mary Handbook," which was printed and distributed by the Catholic Affairs Promotion Committee as a guide for developing this reactionary organization in various places; this was by no means accidental. Li Peili also tried his best to place his confidants in various dioceses to strengthen his deployments against the Chinese people. For example, before the liberation of Kaifeng, regardless of the opposition of the Catholics, he promoted an Italian priest, Yang Lin, by three ranks and promoted him to the Archbishop of the area. After the liberation of Kaifeng, Yang Lin constantly carried out espionage and sabotage activities. In March of this year, he instigated rioters to beat students of Huayang Middle School and has been arrested by the People's Government according to law.

Now that the Chinese mainland has been completely liberated and the Kuomintang reactionary regime has been completely eliminated on the Chinese mainland, what reason does this "envoy" of the Roman Curia to the Kuomintang reactionary government have to continue to stay in China? However, in order to continue to be an enemy of the Chinese people, Li Peili expressed that he would "stay in China indefinitely." According to a telegram issued by the Datong News Agency from Saigon on March 21, 1950, the Roman Curia had instructed all missionary societies in China to "under no circumstances" leave China, and if necessary, establish various religious and charitable organizations among its wealthy Catholics (merchants and landlords) and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Li Peili's continued stay in China was clearly instructed by the Roman Curia. After the liberation of Nanjing, he continued to maintain contact with Hong Kong, Rome, Boston in the United States, and other places, implementing the instructions given to him by American imperialism through the Roman Curia.

Li Peili, staying in liberated China, actively spread reactionary ideas of hatred for the People's Government and hatred for the Communist Party. In 1950, Li Peili "instructed" all Chinese Catholics "not to cooperate with the Communist Party" and not to read progressive books. After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea last June, Li Peili was overjoyed. At the establishment meeting of the Nanjing Catholic Legion of Mary District held on July 2, he encouraged Catholics to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and arrogantly clamored: "The situation has changed, the darkness before dawn has passed, and there will be changes by the end of this year (1950)."

However, contrary to Li Peili's expectations, the change at the end of last year was nothing else but the serious defeat of the American aggressor army on the Korean battlefield. Li Peili showed extreme hatred for the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the patriotic Catholic Church's Three-Self Reform Movement. He stepped up the use of the Catholic Affairs Promotion Committee to print and distribute reactionary books and documents, confuse the thinking of Catholics, and sabotage the Three-Self Reform Movement. For example, the reactionary booklets that have been exposed, such as "Learning Reference," "The Catholic Church's View on the Self-Support, Self-Propagation, and Self-Government Movement," and "The Holy and Universal Church," were all reviewed by Li Peili and printed and distributed by the Catholic Affairs Promotion Committee. Li Peili also personally wrote an absurd essay entitled "Issues and Paths That Priests and Church Members Should Pay Attention to in the Current Situation." In addition to spreading these reactionary remarks, he also interfered with Catholics in various places participating in the patriotic Three-Self Reform Movement through his pre-arranged henchmen in various places; and used his so-called title of "Papal Representative" and so-called "divine right" to deceive and intimidate Chinese Catholics.

In February and March of this year, the people of Nanjing exposed the crimes of foreign nuns of the Sacred Heart Orphanage in harming Chinese children. According to the requests of people from all walks of life, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government took over the orphanage and ordered the deportation of the head of the orphanage, Irish nun Lan Yide, and French nun Hua Ande. However, Li Peili openly instructed Lan Yide and others to resist China's laws and, on March 26, incited all foreign nuns of the orphanage to provoke at the Public Security Bureau. Li Peili's facts of interfering in China's internal affairs and openly confronting the People's Government have been publicly admitted by his secretary Weng Wanda and foreign nuns Bai Anqi and others of the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

The various crimes of the imperialist element Li Peili are intolerable to every Chinese person! Now Catholics and the broad masses of the people in various places unanimously demand that Li Peili be deported. This demand is just! The people of the whole country must adhere to this demand and drive Li Peili out of the country!

　　坚决与中国人民为敌的黎培里
　　孙殿伟
    已经受到全国各地爱国的天主教徒和广大人民同声讨伐的帝国主义分子黎培里，是梵蒂冈教廷派驻国民党反动政府的“公使”，是梵蒂冈教廷干涉中国内政的执行人。他控制着中国天主教的各个教区，一贯向中国天主教徒发号施令，利用中国教会来反对中国人民。
    黎培里于一九四六年十二月十四日来到中国。当时蒋介石匪帮在美国帝国主义的支持下，已发动了大规模进攻中国人民的战争。黎培里为了要配合蒋匪帮的屠杀战争，到华不久，就以视察各教区为名，到各个重要的地区去调查政治情况，并在这些地区的教会中布置了配合蒋匪帮反对中国人民的力量和计划。他为了进一步控制中国天主教各个教区，加强反共反人民的宣传，于一九四七年改组了天主教教务协进委员会。这个机构在黎培里的直接领导下，成为帝国主义在中国天主教内进行一切反革命活动的中心。
    黎培里与蒋介石匪帮的勾结是极为密切的！一九四七年元旦，中国天主教徒中的败类于斌举行就任江苏教区总主教的典礼时，黎培里曾出席致词，公然宣称天主教要辅助蒋介石匪帮的“建国工作”。一九四八年二月，黎培里在上海召开所谓全国公教教育会议，参加这个会议的除了天主教的代表外，还有伪教育部部长朱匪家骅的代表英千里、伪上海市市长吴匪国桢的代表王兆荃、伪上海市教育局局长李匪熙谋以及前美国驻华大使馆秘书麦尔毕等。一贯打着“超政治”旗号的黎培里，这时却赞扬这种无耻的勾结为“政教合一之精神”；他更公开说明这次会议的目的，是为了“教会与政府（指蒋匪帮）从事合作”，以“反对共产主义”。会后不久，他便回到南京去祝贺蒋匪就任“大总统”，他向这个中国人民的公敌致贺词说：“只有天主教的教宗和中华民国的大总统，他们所代表的才是世界上最大最多数的人类的希望与利益。”
    中国人民解放战争胜利形势的迅速发展，使黎培里一类帝国主义分子感到十分焦急。黎培里用“悲惨”、“严重”、“困难”这一类字眼来污蔑中国人民的伟大胜利。他在一九四九年二月间写给他的秘书陈哲敏的信中说：“今天的中国，因着悲惨的时局，圣教传统（应读作帝国主义侵略）的可能性已经减到最低限度，在好多地方已经消灭了。”但是帝国主义分子对于他们在中国的失败是不甘心的，在这封信中，黎培里透露了他要煽动中国教徒与全体中国人民为敌的阴谋。他说：“今后的局面或将更为严重，需要信友们完全而整个的合作，使基督的神国（应读作帝国主义的统治）在中国不但不感到损失而消沉，反而更进一步的发展，继续它神圣的权利。”为了要实现这个阴谋，黎培里有计划地进行了布置：加紧在各地发展天主教的反动核心组织——圣母军。一九四九年初，黎培里的秘书陈哲敏将“圣母军手册”翻译出来，由天主教教务协进委员会印发，作为各地发展这个反动组织的指南，这决不是偶然的。黎培里并尽量在各个教区中安置下自己的心腹，加强他的与中国人民为敌的部署。例如他在开封解放前，不顾教徒们的反对，把一个意籍神甫阳霖连升三级，提拔为该区的总主教。阳霖在开封解放以后，不断进行间谍活动和破坏活动，在今年三月间又唆使暴徒殴打华阳中学的学生，已被人民政府依法逮捕。
    现在，中国大陆已完全解放，国民党反动政权在中国大陆上已被彻底消灭，这个罗马教廷驻国民党反动政府的“公使”，还有什么理由继续留在中国呢？但是黎培里为了要继续与中国人民为敌，却表示要“无限期留在中国”。据一九五○年三月二十一日电通社从西贡发出的电讯揭露，罗马教廷曾经指示在中国的各传教会“在任何情形下”都不可离开中国，必要时并在它的有钱的教徒（商人与地主）中和国民党匪帮残余分子中建立各种宗教团体和慈善团体。黎培里的潜留中国显然是得到罗马教廷的指示的。他在南京解放以后，继续与香港、罗马、美国波士顿等地保持联系，执行美帝国主义通过罗马教廷给予他的指示。
    黎培里留在解放了的中国，积极地散布仇视人民政府、仇视共产党的反动思想。一九五○年，黎培里曾“指示”全体中国教徒“不许与共产党合作”，不准看进步书籍。去年六月美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，黎培里兴高采烈，他在七月二日举行的南京天主教圣母会区会的成立大会上鼓励教徒进行反革命的活动，并狂妄地叫嚣说：“形势已变，黎明前之黑暗已经过去，今年（一九五○年）年底定有变化。”
    但是出于黎培里的意料之外，去年年底的变化并非别的，而是美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上受到了严重的失败。黎培里对于中国人民的抗美援朝运动和爱国天主教徒的三自革新运动表现了极端的仇视。他加紧利用天主教教务协进委员会来印发反动书刊和文件，混乱天主教徒的思想，破坏三自革新运动。例如已被揭发的《学习参考》、《天主教对于自养、自传、自治运动的观点》、《圣而公教会》等反动册子，都是经过黎培里的审阅，交由天主教教务协进委员会印发的。黎培里还亲自写过一篇荒谬的论文，题叫《关于神父及教友们在目前情况下应注意之问题及道路》。除了散布这些反动言论以外，他还通过预先在各地布置好的走狗，干预各地天主教徒参加爱国三自革新运动；并用他的所谓“教宗代表”的名义，用所谓“神权”，来欺骗和威吓中国天主教徒。
    今年二、三月间，南京市人民揭发了圣心儿童院外籍修女残害我国儿童的罪行，南京市人民政府根据各界人民的要求，接管该院，并下令将该院负责人爱尔兰籍修女兰义德、法籍修女华安德驱逐出境。但黎培里竟公然指使兰义德等反抗我国法令，并于三月二十六日教唆该院所有外籍修女齐至公安局挑衅。黎培里这些干涉中国内政、公然与人民政府对抗的事实，已由他的秘书翁万达和圣心儿童院外籍修女白安琪等公认不讳。
    帝国主义分子黎培里的种种罪行，是每一个中国人民都不能容忍的！现在各地天主教徒和广大人民一致要求将黎培里驱逐出境，这种要求是正义的！全国人民必须坚持这种要求，把黎培里赶出国境！
