Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th – In the past two days, the 16th and 17th, 420,000 people from all walks of life in Shanghai held 78 separate rallies, inviting representatives of the慰问团 (comfort mission) to Korea to attend and report. After listening to the reports, people from all walks of life donated airplanes and artillery in succession. Textile workers throughout the city decided to donate a "Shanghai Textile Workers" airplane through increased production. Employees of the Shanghai Customs decided to donate a "China Customs" airplane and have already donated 306 million yuan. Shanghai maritime workers initiated the donation of a "East China Maritime Workers" airplane. Shanghai handicraft workers initiated the donation of a "Shanghai Handicraft Workers" airplane. In addition to proposing to donate through increased production, food workers guaranteed to make sanitary and nutritious dry food to supply the Chinese People's Volunteers. Middle and primary school teachers and social educators across the city guaranteed to complete the donation of two "Shanghai Teachers" fighter planes. Faculty and staff of Guangming Middle School have donated more than 12 million yuan, and the school decided to set up 60 free places in the next semester, specifically for the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Chen Yi, deputy head of the 慰问团 (comfort mission) to Korea, made a report at the conference of staff members of organizations directly under the East China Military and Political Committee. In his report, he said: "Now our volunteer soldiers, under the condition of 'fried noodles plus rifle', have repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the number one imperialist army, which occupies an advantage in equipment. If we actively donate and support the front line, and the soldiers have 'rice plus airplanes and artillery', then it is certain that we will win victory soon." His report received a warm response from the audience at the time. Song Richang, Deputy Secretary-General of the East China Military and Political Committee, announced at the meeting that all staff members of the East China Military and Political Committee organs decided to strive to donate a fighter plane named "East China Military and Political Committee." After listening to the reports of the 慰问团 (comfort mission) representatives on the heinous crimes of the American invading army in killing Korean women and children, the women decided to use increased production to donate a "Shanghai Women" airplane. Housewives in Jiangning, Yulin and other districts have participated in sideline production such as sewing clothes, washing clothes, and pasting envelopes, and decided to donate the income from production and the saved pocket money. After listening to the reports of Chen Yisheng, head of the 慰问团 (comfort mission) branch, and others, the Shanghai business community further recognized that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of China's national industry and commerce, and expressed their intention to check the patriotic covenants of all industries and formulate plans to improve operations, increase production, and donate based on the specific conditions of each enterprise. After listening to the reports, the literary and art circles, religious circles, welfare and relief circles, and medical circles all expressed their willingness to actively donate airplanes and artillery.
