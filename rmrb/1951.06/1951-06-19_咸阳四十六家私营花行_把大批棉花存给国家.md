　　Forty-six Private Cotton Firms in Xianyang
　　Store Large Quantities of Cotton with the State
　　
In response to the government's call, forty-six private cotton firms in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, have stored all 150,000 jin of their existing cotton with the Xianyang branch of the state-owned China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Corporation on June 12th and 13th. On the 14th, the city's Cotton Trade Association wrote a letter to business merchants in the same trade throughout the province, suggesting that cotton merchants should participate in this patriotic cotton selling and storage movement. The letter said: "To all fellow merchants in the same trade throughout the province: The forty-six cotton firms in our Xianyang City have already stored 150,000 jin of cotton with the state. We have a large amount of cotton in storage, and we cannot simply wait for high prices to sell it, watching factories shut down and causing difficulties for the country. We hope that you will also take action under the banner of patriotism, abandon all concerns, and sell or store all your existing cotton with the state."

　　咸阳四十六家私营花行
　  把大批棉花存给国家
    陕西省咸阳市四十六家私营花行，响应政府号召，已在六月十二、十三两天中将现存的十五万斤棉花全部存到国营花纱布公司咸阳支公司。十四日该市棉业同业公会向全省同业商户写信，建议存棉花的商人都来参加这个爱国售棉储棉运动。信上说：“全省各同业商民们：我们咸阳市四十六家花行已经把十五万斤棉花都存给国家了。我们有大量的存棉，不能单等高价出卖，看着工厂停工，叫国家增加困难。希望你们也在爱国主义旗帜下行动起来，丢掉一切顾虑，把全部存棉卖给国家或存给国家。”
