Xinxiang County Cooperative Should Improve Cotton Purchasing Work; Preserve Excellent Cotton Seeds in the Seed Propagation Area
To the Editor:

Article 5 of the 1951 Cotton Pre-Purchase Agreement signed by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives (see page 2 of the People's Daily, March 25th of this year) stipulates: "In the seed propagation areas, pre-purchased cotton should mainly be seed cotton." Section 2 of paragraph 3 of Article 9 also stipulates: "The Cotton Improvement Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture shall be responsible for processing seed cotton of improved varieties in the seed propagation areas." These two provisions are very important for improving China's cotton varieties and increasing China's cotton production. However, the Xinxiang County Cooperative in Pingyuan Province has not earnestly implemented this provision in its cotton pre-purchase work. In the Qiliying area of the fourth district of Xinxiang County, a total of eighteen villages have relatively pure and good quality Si Zi Cotton No. 4. In 1950, it began to be designated as a seed propagation area. Through the operation of the Xinxiang Prefectural Cotton Improvement Agency, the purity of the improved cotton varieties in this area can reach over 90% this year, which is very important for promoting improved cotton varieties in the Xinxiang area. The Xinxiang County Cooperative is now pre-purchasing a large amount of ginned cotton in the Qiliying area. According to the statistics of the cooperatives in five villages including Qiliying, Xiazhuang, Zhongcaocun, Kangzhuang, and Liudian Village, a total of 760,000 jin of ginned cotton is planned to be pre-purchased, and 281,000 jin has already been pre-purchased. These pre-purchase villages have a total of about 20,000 mu of cotton. After the current pre-purchase, the soybean cakes lent out by the County Cooperative will also have to be repaid with cotton, and the cotton farmers will also have to keep some for their own use. In this way, there may not be much seed cotton left for preservation. This situation poses a serious threat to cotton variety improvement in the Xinxiang area. In order to protect improved cotton varieties, the Xinxiang Prefectural Cotton Improvement Agency submitted this issue to the Xinxiang County Cooperative for research; Director Ren Yun of the Cooperative replied: "We are not confident in grading the purchased seed cotton, and the masses are not accustomed to selling seed cotton." We believe that this opinion is incorrect. The fact that the masses are not accustomed to selling seed cotton can be resolved through publicity and education; lack of confidence in grading should not be a reason. The reason why the Xinxiang County Cooperative wants to violate the regulations of the higher authorities is because they only want to save themselves trouble and do not pay enough attention to the matter of improving cotton varieties, which is related to the long-term interests of the country. In order to do a good job in promoting improved cotton varieties, we are raising this issue in the hope that the Xinxiang County Cooperative will improve its cotton purchasing work.

### 新乡县联社应改进收棉工作  保存良种管理区的优良棉种

　　新乡县联社应改进收棉工作        
    保存良种管理区的优良棉种编辑同志：
    中央人民政府贸易部和中华全国合作社联合总社所订立的一九五一年度预购棉花协议书（见本年三月二十五日人民日报第二版）第五条规定：“预购棉花在良种管理区以籽棉为主”，第九条第三节二段又规定：“良种管理区之良种棉则由农业部棉产改进处负责籽棉加工。”这两点规定，对于改良我国的棉种，增进我国的棉花生产，是非常重要的。但是平原省新乡县县联社在预购棉花工作中并没有认真执行这个规定。新乡县四区七里营一带共十八个村庄，斯字棉四号棉较为纯良，一九五○年开始划为良种管理区，经新乡专署棉业改进社的经营，这个区的优良棉种的纯度在今年即可达到百分之九十以上，这对于新乡一带的优良棉种推广工作是非常重要的。新乡县联社现在正在七里营一带大量预购皮棉，据七里营、夏庄、中曹村、康庄、刘店村等五个村合作社的统计，计划共预购皮棉七十六万斤，现已预购二十八万一千斤。这几个预购村共种棉约二万亩，经过现在的预购，县联社贷出的豆饼也要收回一部分棉花，棉农自己还要留一部分自用，这样一来，可能做为保种的籽棉就不多了。这种情况，对于新乡地区的棉种改良确是一个严重的威胁。为了保护优良棉种，新乡专署棉业改进社曾把这个问题提供新乡县联社研究；该社任云主任竟回答说：“收购籽棉分级没有把握，而且群众对出售籽棉也不习惯。”我们认为这个意见是不正确的。群众不习惯于出售籽棉，是可以通过宣传教育来解决的；分级没有把握，更不应成为理由。新乡县联社之所以要违反上级的规定，是因为他们只图自己省事，而对于改良棉种这样关系到国家长远利益的事情却重视不足。为了做好优良棉种推广工作，我们把这个问题提出来，希望新乡县联社改进收棉工作。
