　　Instructions from the Government Administration Council on Cotton Purchasing and Storage Reach Gangli Village
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Chengyi
　　After the instructions from the Central People's Government Government Administration Council on cotton purchasing and storage reached Gangli Village, Ninth District, Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, Gao Xianxin, the secretary of the Gangli Village Communist Party branch, and the village cadres held a village cadre meeting and a meeting of more than thirty Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, activists, and propagandists overnight to discuss the instructions.
　　After reading the Government Administration Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage at the meeting, Gao Mingwu, chairman of the village people's representative meeting, solemnly said: "We are now resisting America and aiding Korea. We cannot let the textile factories stop working, and we cannot let American imperialism blockade us!" Gao Xianxin, the secretary of the Communist Party branch, said: "Workers and peasants are one family. With cotton, the factories will not stop working. We must mobilize cotton farmers who still have cotton to sell it to the state!" Village cadre Gao Xinyuan examined his own patriotic consciousness and said: "In the past, when the people's government purchased cotton, I only knew how to assign tasks; now I realize that selling cotton to the state is beneficial to the country, and that is patriotism." The branch secretary and village cadres unanimously agreed to properly mobilize all cotton farmers in the village to voluntarily sell their cotton to the state or store it with the state. After discussing the Government Administration Council's instructions, the Party and League members, activists, and propagandists also expressed their attitudes. Propagandist Zhang Jinsheng proposed: Guarantee to mobilize five cotton farmers to sell cotton to the state. The propagandists also challenged each other, guaranteeing to make cotton farmers understand the reason for "why sell cotton and store cotton with the state."
　　On June 8, propagandists were everywhere in the dining areas (where farmers naturally gather with their rice bowls while eating) and in the places where wheat was being harvested, threshed, and rested, publicizing the reason to love the country and sell the stored cotton to the country.
　　On the evening of the 8th, the Gangli Village cotton farmers' meeting was held. Although it was the busy season for wheat harvesting, summer planting, and cotton seedling hoeing, 162 people from more than 100 farm households in the village participated in the meeting. Everyone listened attentively to the comrades from the provincial and prefectural work inspection teams explaining the Government Administration Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage, and the speeches by Gao Xianxin, the secretary of the Communist Party branch, and the village cadres calling for cotton sales. Afterwards, the cotton farmers discussed in groups. Cotton farmer Gao Xiyuan said: "The people's government has taken care of us in all aspects, guaranteeing that each jin of cotton can be exchanged for eight and a half jin of millet, and this year also brought soybean cakes, and the cotton fields and grain fields pay the same public grain. We must listen to the people's government."
　　At the meeting, cotton farmer activist Gao Qing proposed on the spot to sell 68 jin of cotton to the state, and the chairman of the People's Congress sold 50 jin. Many cotton farmers crowded around the table to register for cotton sales, vying to register the amount of cotton they would sell and store. The farmer Liu Niu shouted as she squeezed to the registration table: "Write down seven jin of ginned cotton for me. I originally planned to spin it into thread, but I will sell it to the state!"
　　Gangli Village has many mountains and thin soil, and last year the cotton suffered a hailstorm, so the harvest was not good, so most of the cotton had already been sold. Now that they heard that the country needed cotton, many cotton farmers took out almost all of the remaining cotton. On the night of the meeting, 28 cotton farmers registered to sell a total of 640 jin of seed cotton and ginned cotton to the state.
　　At the end of the meeting, the comrades from the Pingyuan Province and Anyang Prefecture work inspection team praised the patriotic cotton sales enthusiasm of the cotton farmers in Gangli Village, and at the same time stated: We will do our best to supply the things that cotton farmers need to buy. The comrades from the cotton yarn cloth company proposed: The cotton yarn cloth company will send people to the village to pick up the cotton, so that cotton farmers do not have to travel a long way during the busy farming season.

　　政务院购棉、储棉工作的指示到了港里村
    新华社记者　尹承伊
    中央人民政府政务院关于购棉、储棉工作的指示传到了平原省安阳县九区港里村后，港里村中共支部书记高显新和村干部们就连夜召开村干部会和三十多个中共党员、青年团员积极分子和宣传员会议，讨论这个指示。
    在会上宣读了政务院关于购棉、储棉工作的指示以后，村人民代表会主席高明五严肃地说：“现在正抗美援朝哩。不能让纺织工厂停工，不能让美帝国主义封锁住我们！”中共支部书记高显新说：“工农是一家，有了棉花工厂就不会停工。一定要动员还存有棉花的棉农把棉花卖给国家！”村干部高心源检讨自己的爱国观念，说：“过去人民政府收购棉花，我只知道布置任务；现在我才知道卖棉花给国家，对国家有利，就是爱国。”支部书记和村干部们，一致同意好好动员全村棉农自愿地把存棉售给国家或向国家储存。党、团员积极分子和宣传员们讨论了政务院的指示以后，也都表示了自己的态度。宣传员张金声提出：保证动员五户棉农卖棉给国家。各宣传员还互相挑战，保证叫棉农懂得“为什么要向国家售棉、储棉”的道理。
    六月八日这一天，各个饭市（农民吃饭时，端着饭碗自然集结的地方）上和割麦、打场、休息的地方，到处都有宣传员在宣传爱国家、把存棉卖给国家的道理。
    八日夜晚，港里村棉农大会开会了。虽然正是在麦收、夏种、锄棉苗的紧张时期，可是全村一百多家农民，就有一百六十二人参加大会。大家聚精会神地听着省和专署工作检查组同志讲解政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示，中共支部书记高显新和村干部们号召售棉的讲话。随后棉农们就分组进行讨论。棉农高喜元说：“人民政府各方面都照顾了我们，保证每斤棉花可换八斤半小米，今年还给运来了豆饼，棉田和粮田出一样的公粮。我们一定得听人民政府的话。”
    在大会中，棉农积极分子高庆当场提出售给国家棉花六十八斤，人民代表会主席出售五十斤。许多棉农挤到登记售棉的桌子周围，争着登记售棉储棉的数目。农妇刘牛氏挤到登记桌子前，大声说：“给俺写上七斤皮棉，原来俺准备纺线的，也卖给国家吧！”
    港里村山地多，土质薄，加以去年棉花遭了雹灾，收成不好，所以大部分棉花早就卖出去了。现在听说国家需要棉花，许多棉农又把剩下的棉花几乎全部都拿了出来。大会当晚有二十八户棉农登记了售给国家的籽棉、皮棉共计六百四十斤。
    大会结束时，平原省和安阳专区工作检查组的同志们表扬了港里村棉农的爱国售棉热情，同时表示：棉农需要买的东西一定尽力供给。花纱布公司的同志提出：花纱布公司将派人来村取棉，免得棉农在农忙时赶远路去送。
