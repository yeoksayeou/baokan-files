China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation
Calls for Doing a Good Job in Cotton Purchasing and Storage, Striving to Fulfill the Cotton Supply Task

The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation issued the following call to all its staff nationwide in order to smoothly complete the cotton purchasing and storage task:

As a result of the people's government's encouragement of cotton planting, the national cotton production in 1950 has gradually approached the needs of the yarn mills. In the past six months, during the cotton conservation movement, yarn mills have made every effort to use short fibers and substandard cotton for spinning, under the premise of not affecting the quality of the finished product, so that the supply and demand of raw cotton tends to be balanced. However, of the cotton produced in 1950, in addition to the large part controlled by the state through procurement and other means, some is still in the hands of cotton farmers. This has created the current difficulty in the supply of raw cotton to yarn mills.

How much cotton is currently stored among the people? According to the results of typical village surveys conducted separately in each province, the highest accounts for 30 percent of last year's output, and the lowest accounts for about 10 percent. In Beijie Village, Lijia Town, Bin County, Shandong Province, 12 out of 144 households have cotton stored, with the most storing cotton for two or three years. In two villages in Ershilipu, 20 out of 160 households have cotton stored, accounting for about 80 percent. Generally speaking, farmers have always had the habit of storing cotton. Last year's bumper cotton harvest has further increased the storage volume of relatively wealthy farmers. They are not in urgent need of money, so they are not in a hurry to sell. Therefore, the circulation of cotton is hindered. The total amount of cotton accumulated by farmers, plus the cotton currently in trade turnover or handover process, is considerable. As long as farmers can respond to the call of the state, sell as soon as possible in the short term, and step up the organization of its concentration, yarn mills can continue to produce according to plan to enrich the supply of yarn and cloth.

In order to smoothly complete the task of purchasing and storing cotton, the comrades of our China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation system must: (1) Regard the cotton purchasing and storage work as the most important central task at present, and immediately combine with the cooperative to go deep into the countryside to carry out cotton purchasing business. (2) For the materials that farmers need to purchase after selling cotton, such as grain, fuel, salt, lamp oil, fertilizer, farm tools, cloth, etc., we should work with brother companies to strive to ensure supply. (3) Simplify all procedures in the cotton purchasing process, and provide cotton-selling farmers with all necessary conveniences such as weighing, delivering cotton, and receiving payment. During the busy farming season, if farmers do not have time to go to market to sell, mobile teams can be organized to carry cash or grain and daily necessities to the countryside to purchase door-to-door. (4) For farmers who are relatively wealthy and not in urgent need of money, patriotic education should be carried out under the leadership of party and government organs, explaining the great benefits of the state's self-sufficiency in cotton (not relying on foreign cotton) policy to cotton farmers, explaining the increase in cotton production this year, and breaking the cotton farmers' reluctance to sell. Publicize the state's policy of protecting cotton farmers, and overcome the ideological concerns of "fear of revealing wealth." Actively mobilize them to store existing cotton with the state. (5) For stored cotton, a fair market price can be implemented, guaranteeing the principal and maintaining value (allowing for price increases but not decreases), and a certain amount of interest can be paid. The length of time for storing cotton can be chosen voluntarily by cotton farmers without any restrictions. Storage methods: small deposits and lump-sum withdrawals, lump-sum deposits and small withdrawals, and lump-sum deposits and lump-sum withdrawals are all acceptable. When withdrawing at maturity, cotton depositors can choose to take cash or exchange for physical objects in order to fully protect the interests of farmers storing cotton. In old areas where cooperatives have a foundation, we can try to expand cotton storage work through cooperatives. (6) In the triangular areas where provinces border each other, cotton purchasing agencies at all levels must maintain close contact in cotton purchasing and storage work and take unified steps. The mastery of grade standards and purchase prices must be completely consistent so that farmers can sell cotton everywhere in the same way, reducing the labor of trekking.

After cotton is purchased, it must be ginned, baled, and transported centrally in order to supply yarn mills in a timely manner. During the crash production of yarn mills last November, our comrades in cotton purchasing and transportation in various places worked day and night, regardless of hardships, ginning and baling the purchased seed cotton and transporting it immediately. Many model workers in cotton purchasing and transportation emerged, completing the task of timely supply to yarn mills, ensuring the high production enthusiasm of yarn mill workers, and a large supply of yarn and cloth to the market, which stabilized prices accordingly. These achievements are worthy of praise. This year we have more yarn and cloth in our hands and can appropriately adjust the supply, making it easier to stabilize prices. However, yarn mills in various places are increasing their production efficiency and need more cotton, even more urgently than last year. Therefore, we should carry forward the spirit of the past and complete the cotton processing and transportation work in a blitz to ensure the cotton supply for yarn mills.

At present, the state is calling for the development of a patriotic movement to sell and store cotton. The comrades of our China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation should also immediately launch a work competition for purchasing, ginning, and transporting; and listen to the opinions of the masses at any time to improve working methods and approaches to ensure the victorious completion of the cotton purchasing and storage task.

### 中国花纱布总公司  号召做好购棉储棉工作  为完成供棉任务而斗争

　　中国花纱布总公司
    号召做好购棉储棉工作  为完成供棉任务而斗争
    中国花纱布总公司为顺利完成购棉储棉任务向所属全国工作人员发出如下的号召：
    人民政府奖励植棉的结果，一九五○年全国棉花的产量，已逐渐接近纱厂的需要量。最近半年来，在用棉节约运动中，纱厂以不影响成品品质为前提，已尽量搭用斩刀花、霜黄花纺纱，使原棉供需趋向平衡。但是，由于一九五○年度所生产的棉花，除国家通过收购等工作掌握了大部分以外，还有一部分仍在棉农手中。这就产生了目前纱厂原棉供应上的困难。
    目前民间存棉量究竟还有多少呢？根据各省分别作典型村调查的结果，多的占去年产量的百分之三十，最少的也占百分之十左右。山东滨县李家镇北街一百四十四户，内有十二户存棉，最多者存有二、三年的棉花。二十里铺两个村，一百六十户，内有二十户存棉尚有百分之八十左右。一般说来，农民向来有存棉的习惯。去年棉产丰收，较富裕的农民储存量更加增大。他们不急需钱，就不急于出售。因之障碍了棉花的流通。农民积余的存棉量加上目前尚在贸易周转或交接过程中的棉花，总数量是相当可观的。只要农民能响应国家的号召，在短期内尽速出售，并加紧组织其集中，纱厂即可照计划继续生产，以充裕纱布的供应。
    为顺利完成购棉储棉的任务，我花纱布公司系统的工作同志必须做到：（一）将购棉储棉工作视为当前最重要的一项中心工作，立即结合合作社，深入农村，展开收棉业务。（二）农民售出棉花后需要购进的物资，如粮食、燃料、食盐、灯油、肥料、农具、布匹等，应结合兄弟公司，努力保证供应。（三）简化购棉过程中一切手续，尽量给售棉农民以过秤、交花、领款等各种必要的方便。在农忙时期，如农民无闲上市出售，可组织巡回流动小组，携带现款或粮食及日用必需品，下乡登门收购。（四）对于生活较富裕、不急于用钱的农民，应在党政机关领导下进行爱国保国的宣传教育，说明国家的棉花自给（不依赖外棉）政策给与棉农的重大利益，说明本年棉花的增产情况，打破棉农的惜售心理。宣传国家保护棉农的政策，克服“怕露富”的思想顾虑。积极动员其将现有棉花向国家储存。（五）对于储存棉花，可按合理牌价，实行保本保值（听涨不听落），并可付给一定的利息。存棉时间的长短，可由棉农自愿选择，不加任何限制。存棉办法：零存整取，整存零取，整存整取均可。期满提取时，取现款或换取实物，亦可由存棉户自行选择，以充分保障农民的存棉利益。在合作社有基础的老区，可尽量通过合作社展开存棉工作。（六）在省与省交界的三角地带，各级收花机构在购棉储棉工作上必须密切联系，采取统一步骤。等级标准及收购价格的掌握上，必须完全一致。使农民到处售棉都是一样，减少跋涉之劳。
    棉花收购后，必须立即轧花打包，集中调运，以便能及时供应纱厂。在去年十一月纱厂突击生产期间，我们各地的购棉运棉工作同志，曾不分昼夜，不辞艰辛，将收购的籽皮棉随时轧花，随即打包调运，出现许多购棉和运棉的模范工作者，完成了及时供应纱厂的任务，保证了纱厂工人的高度生产情绪，纱布大量供应市场，物价随之日趋稳定。这些成绩是值得表扬的。今年我们掌握纱布较多，供应上可适当调节，比较容易稳定价格，但各地纱厂因生产效率提高，需棉也比去年更多，更急。所以我们应该发扬过去的精神，突击完成棉花加工调运工作，以保证纱厂用棉。
    目前国家号召开展售棉储棉的爱国运动，我们花纱布公司的工作同志们也应该立即开展收购轧花运输等工作竞赛；并随时倾听群众意见，改进工作方法方式，以保证购棉储棉任务的胜利完成。
