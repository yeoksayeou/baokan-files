The China Democratic League, China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party
    Instructed Members to Promote Patriotic Support for the Front

    [This Newspaper] The China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have respectively called on all members, associates, and party members throughout the country to respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea with practical actions.

    The Central Political Bureau of the China Democratic League held a meeting on June 2nd and passed a resolution, which stated: (1) All members should, in their respective work posts, take the initiative to promote the signing of patriotic covenants, take the lead in guaranteeing their implementation, and report on inspections regularly. (2) All members should, based on their own capabilities and by encouraging their relatives and friends, donate special funds on a long-term or temporary basis to purchase weapons such as airplanes, artillery, and tanks to support the volunteer army and consolidate national defense. (3) All members should regularly assist the government in carrying out preferential treatment work.

    The China National Democratic Construction Association, in a letter to local branches, requested that local branches first carry out ideological mobilization work through the following two methods: (1) Rapidly organize, through the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, large-scale reporting sessions, divided by industry and trade, to convey the reports from the delegation to Korea for condolences, ensuring that every industrialist, businessman, employee, and their family members have the opportunity to hear them. (2) Discuss the June 2nd appeal of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the June 2nd People's Daily editorial "Extensively Conclude and Conscientiously Implement Patriotic Covenants," and "Two Major Events to Support the Front." If possible, it is also recommended that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce convene symposiums for various industries to discuss these documents in conjunction with the reports from the delegation to Korea for condolences. The goal is to further clarify each person's current tasks during the discussion.

    While and after carrying out these two tasks, all branches should immediately carry out the following work: (1) Inspect patriotic covenants. All branches should seize this opportunity to mobilize the industrial and commercial sectors to universally conclude patriotic covenants through the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Those who have not concluded them should do so quickly, and those who have already concluded them should conduct inspections. If any supplements or revisions are needed, they should be revised immediately. (2) Regarding the donation of airplanes and artillery, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has called for it to be combined with the production increase movement. The specific tasks of industrialists, businessmen, and financiers are to improve management, economize on consumption, and donate one or several days' worth of profits each month to support the volunteer army. They are also welcome to donate airplanes, artillery, or other weapons individually if they have sufficient financial resources. We must understand that the basic spirit of the donation of airplanes and artillery movement is not to affect or reduce our production and business due to donations, but to contribute a portion of the increased income from expanding and improving production and management. This shows that our donation movement is active rather than passive. Industrialists and businessmen must deeply understand this spirit in order to do a good job in this large-scale and sustained donation work. (3) Do a good job in preferential treatment and donation work. (4) The China National Democratic Construction Association requires local branches to further organize and plan the above three major tasks through the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, launching a warm and universal competition movement between households, industries, and cities. The competition movement should involve both donations and increased production, and increased production should be done even better. The amount of one-time donations should be large, and permanent donations should not be reduced. The donation tasks of each household, industry, and port must be specific and reliable. Once proposed, they must be implemented.

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has made six decisions and issued instructions to the party's organizations at all levels, requiring that those in all provinces and cities who have already concluded patriotic covenants should immediately inspect and revise them, making the movement to increase production and income through donations and to do a good job in treating the families of volunteer soldiers as important contents of the patriotic covenant. All provincial and municipal organizations can, according to the actual situation, stipulate a fixed implementation period for the patriotic covenant, as well as conduct regular inspections and summaries, conscientiously fulfill it, and gradually improve it. At the same time, all provincial and municipal organizations should, according to the spirit of the call from the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, mobilize all party members, family members of party members, and the masses of the people to launch a donation movement, and assist the government in doing a good job in providing preferential treatment and pensions to the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and disabled soldiers.

　　民盟、民建和农工民主党
    指示盟员等推动爱国支前工作
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国农工民主党分别号召全国盟员、会员、党员以实际行动来响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召。
    中国民主同盟中央政治局六月二日举行会议，通过决议，略称：（一）所有盟员应就其本人工作岗位，分别主动推动签订爱国公约，带头保证实行，定期报告检查。（二）所有盟员应就其本人能力并推动其亲友，分长期和临时捐献专款，购买飞机大炮坦克等武器支援志愿军并巩固国防。（三）所有盟员应经常协助政府进行优抚工作。
    民主建国会给各地分会的信中，要求各地分会先即通过下列两种方式，做好思想动员工作：（一）迅速通过工商联，积极地、大规模地组织分行分业的听取传达报告会，赴朝慰问团的传达报告，务使每个工商业家、从业人员及其家属，都能有机会听到。（二）讨论中国抗美援朝总会六月二日的号召、六月二日《人民日报》社论《广泛订立并认真执行爱国公约》和《支援前线的两件大事》。如有可能，并建议工商联召集各行业的座谈会，把这些文件结合赴朝慰问团的传达报告，展开讨论。以要求在讨论中进一步认清每个人的当前任务。
    各分会在进行这两件工作的同时与以后，应该迅即进行下列工作：（一）检查爱国公约。各分会应该抓住这个时机，通过工商联，发动工商界普遍订立爱国公约。凡是没有订立的应该赶紧订立，凡是已经订立的应该进行检查，发现应该补充和修正的，就马上进行改订。（二）关于捐献飞机大炮运动，中国抗美援朝总会所号召的是要与增产运动相结合。工商业及金融业者的具体任务就是改善经营、节约消费，以每个月的一天或数天的盈利捐献出来，支援志愿军，并欢迎其中有足够资力者单独捐献飞机、大炮或其他武器。我们须明白：捐献飞机、大炮运动的基本精神，不是要我们因捐献而影响或缩小我们的生产和事业，而是要我们在扩大、改善生产及经营中，贡献其一部新增的收入。这就说明：我们的捐献运动，是积极的而不是消极的。工商业者必须深刻体会这种精神，然后才能做好这一大规模的持久的捐献工作。（三）做好优抚工作、捐献工作。（四）要求各地分会通过工商联进一步有组织有计划地把以上三大工作在户与户，行业与行业，城市与城市之间，展开热烈的普遍的竞赛运动。竞赛运动，要捐献和增产，并把增产做得更好；一次捐献要多，永久性捐献也不减少。各户、各业、各埠的捐献任务，必须具体、确实。提出之后，就一定要能贯彻实现。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会作出了六项决定，并向该党各级组织发出指示，要求各省市组织已订立爱国公约的应立即检查修改，把增加生产、增加收入的捐献运动和作好优待志愿军家属工作作为爱国公约的重要内容。各省市组织对爱国公约，可根据实际情况，规定固定的执行期限，及定期检查总结，认真履行，逐步提高。同时，各省市组织应根据抗美援朝总会号召的精神，发动全体党员、党员家属和人民群众展开捐献运动，并协助政府做好优待抚恤烈士家属、革命军人家属和残废军人的工作。
