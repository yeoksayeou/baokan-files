　　Rectifying and Developing Secondary Technical Education
    The first National Secondary Technical Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has officially opened. The convening of this conference is of great significance. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "Training technical personnel is a fundamental plan for our country." In accordance with the New Democratic education policy and proceeding from the actual needs of national construction, rectifying and developing secondary technical schools to cultivate a large number of intermediate technical talents is also one of our current important political tasks.
    According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education of the Central Government in the second half of 1950, there were a total of 507 secondary technical schools in the country, with 110,300 students. Among them, 27,800 were in industry, 21,700 in agriculture, 21,000 in finance and economics, 18,400 in health, and 6,000 in other fields. In addition, there were approximately 15,400 people whose statistics were not correctly recorded. This number is far from meeting the needs of various construction departments, and this situation is extremely inconsistent with the needs of our national construction. Therefore, actively rectifying and developing secondary technical schools to train a large number of intermediate technical talents for the national construction cause, and especially attaching importance to concentrating a group of young people from revolutionary cadres and worker-peasant labor models to learn technology and train them to become a strong backbone of technical personnel, is a correct policy that conforms to the nature and needs of our country.
    Since secondary technical education includes a wide range of issues, such as the direction, tasks, school system, leadership relations, establishment plan, funding, curriculum, teaching materials, and teachers of secondary technical education, these issues need to be properly resolved. However, this National Secondary Technical Education Conference cannot discuss and resolve all of these issues, but can only focus on resolving the direction, tasks, leadership relations, and funding of secondary technical schools, as well as the establishment plan of national secondary technical schools in 1951. If these issues can be resolved correctly, then the secondary technical education of New China will have the correct direction and a good start.

　　整顿和发展中等技术教育
    中央人民政府教育部召开的首次全国中等技术教育会议已正式开幕了。这个会议的召开，是有着重要意义的。毛主席曾指示我们：“培养技术人员，是我们国家的根本之图。”根据新民主主义的教育政策，从国家建设的实际需要出发，整顿和发展中等技术学校，培养大批中级技术人才，也正是我们当前重要政治任务之一。
    根据中央教育部一九五○年下半年的统计，全国共有中等技术学校五百零七所，学生十一万零三百人。其中工业方面有二万七千八百人，农业方面有二万一千七百人，财经方面有二万一千人，卫生方面有一万八千四百人，其他方面有六千人。此外尚未正确统计的约有一万五千四百人。这个数目是远赶不上各个建设部门的需要的，这种情况也是与我们国家建设需要极不相称的。因此，积极地整顿与发展中等技术学校，为国家建设事业培养大量中级技术人才，以及特别重视从革命干部和工农劳动模范中集中一批青年来学习技术，把他们培养成为技术人员的坚强骨干，乃是合乎我们国家的性质和需要的正确的方针。
    由于中等技术教育包括的问题很广，如中等技术教育的方针、任务、学制、领导关系、设置计划、经费、课程、教材、师资等，这些问题都需要很好地加以解决。但这次全国中等技术教育会议还不可能将这些问题全部地加以讨论和解决，而只能着重在解决中等技术学校的方针、任务和领导关系、经费问题，以及一九五一年全国中等技术学校的设置计划等问题。这些问题如能正确地解决了，那么新中国的中等技术教育就会有正确的方向和良好的开端。
