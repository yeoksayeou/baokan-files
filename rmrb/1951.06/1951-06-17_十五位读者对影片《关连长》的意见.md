　　Fifteen Readers' Opinions on the Film "Company Commander Guan"
    Recently, this publication received opinions from fifteen readers regarding the film "Company Commander Guan." Everyone unanimously believes that this is a film with serious flaws. These fifteen readers are: Chen Dongbai from the Political Department of the Public Security of the East China Military Region; Ma Yourong, Hu Xizhe, and Kong Cheng from the Cultural Section of a certain division; Bai Shizao from the PLA Pictorial; Gao Guanying, Cao Guimei, and Lan Cun from the Central Institute of Literature; Zhang Ruji, Jian Renbin, and Yu Yuanfu from the Central Academy of Fine Arts; Li Ruchun from the Central Academy of Drama; and Wang Xiu, Gao Xiang from Beijing, and Li Yunshan from Shanghai. Due to space limitations, these submissions cannot be published individually. The following is a summary of everyone's opinions (instances overlapping with Comrade Feng Zheng's article in today's publication have been omitted):
    Everyone unanimously believes that the main flaw of "Company Commander Guan" is its distorted portrayal of the People's Liberation Army. The film depicts the PLA as an army without Party leadership, without mass work, without organization or discipline, and lacking cultural education. The political instructor is portrayed as superfluous, like Company Commander Guan's orderly. The soldiers are depicted as constantly spouting strange remarks, not only not helping the common people with their work, but also trampling on their seedlings. Particularly egregious is the portrayal of Company Commander Guan—a combat hero of the People's Liberation Army—as a crude and ridiculous clown, a figure of individual heroism. When Company Commander Guan first appears on the screen, rolling on the ground with many children, it really gives one a feeling of Wu Xun. Later, him carrying luggage, smoking a pipe, wiping sweat, getting angry, all cause the audience to burst into laughter. When the Eighth Company is left in the rear "awaiting orders," Company Commander Guan does not lead the soldiers in preparing for battle, but repeatedly runs to the regimental headquarters to request combat missions. Why is his "enthusiasm" so high? From his conversation with the regimental commander, it can be seen: "'Letters of determination' are no longer effective, will we still be able to earn merit?!" "Bring back the Seventh and Ninth Companies, can't you let us go up and fight?" It turns out that Company Commander Guan's purpose in requesting to go to the front line is to "earn merit" for himself, and for the sake of earning merit, he disregards the current combat plan and demands that the Seventh and Ninth Companies be brought back. Would this be the correct thinking of a commander in the People's Liberation Army?
    In terms of creative methods, "Company Commander Guan" does not praise the noble qualities and heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army from a positive perspective, but mostly proceeds from shortcomings (many of which are untrue), or uses shortcomings to set off the advantages. For example, using Party members making strange remarks: "The superiors treat our Eighth Company as rice buckets," "They don't trust us," "We can't get anywhere," etc., to illustrate the high combat morale of the Party members; using soldiers trampling on seedlings to illustrate Company Commander Guan's strong mass perspective; using a Party member saying to a non-Party member: "I'll fetch you washing water every night from now on"; using Company Commander Guan giving soldiers two packs of cigarettes to illustrate that Party members and Company Commander Guan humbly accept the opinions of the masses; using only children seeing off the troops to illustrate the harmonious relationship between the army and the people; using university students speaking grandly about materialistic philosophy to illustrate the future transformation of intellectuals; using fraternal units satirizing the Eighth Company for only being able to guard prisoners to increase the Eighth Company's desire for war; using the entire company biting their fingers to write letters of request to illustrate the firm fighting will and determination of the People's Army; using hesitation and delaying combat time to illustrate Company Commander Guan's love for children… etc. Such creative methods cause the work to have precisely the opposite of the author's subjective intention, yielding bad results.
    In terms of subject matter, "Company Commander Guan" selects an atypical event. The film attempts to illustrate the theme "revolutionary war is for the sake of future generations" through this atypical event. The result is that petty-bourgeois vulgar humanism replaces revolutionary humanism. Does it mean that if there were no children in the Red Mansion, our war of liberation would not be for the liberation of all mankind, for the sake of future generations? This work, in terms of its subject matter, is also atypical.

### 十五位读者对影片《关连长》的意见

专栏：读者来信

　　十五位读者对影片《关连长》的意见
    最近本刊收到了十五位读者对《关连长》的意见，大家一致认为这是一部有着严重缺点的影片。这十五位读者是：华东军区公安政治部陈东白，某师文化科马友荣、胡希哲、孔程，解放军画报社白世藻，中央文学研究所高冠英、曹桂梅、兰村，中央美术学院张汝济、蹇人斌、俞元辅，中央戏剧学院栗如椿，北京王秀、高翔，上海李云山等。由于篇幅限制，这些稿件不能一一发表，特摘要综合大家意见如下（其中与今日本刊冯征同志的文章内重复的例子，已略去）：
    大家一致认为《关连长》的主要缺点是把人民解放军作了十分歪曲的描写。电影把人民解放军描写成为一支没有党的领导的、没有群众工作的、无组织无纪律的、缺乏文化教养的军队。把政治指导员描写成为可有可无的，就像是关连长的勤务员。把战士描写成满嘴怪话、不但不帮老百姓做活，而且还要踩老百姓青苗的丘八。尤其突出的是把关连长——人民解放军的一位战斗英雄描写成为一个粗鲁可笑的小丑，描写成为一位个人英雄主义似的人物。当关连长最初在银幕上出现的时候，抱着许多小孩子在地上打滚，真给人一种武训式的感觉。以后他抱行李、抽旱烟、擦汗、生气，无一不叫观众哄笑。当第八连留在后方“待命”的时候，关连长不是领导战士作战斗准备工作，而是三番五次地跑到团部请求战斗任务。为什么他的“热情”这样高呢？从他对团长的谈话中可以看出：“‘决心书’也不顶事了，那俺们这功还立不立呀？！”“把七、九连调回来，让俺们上去打不行吗？”原来关连长要求上前线的目的是为了要自己“立功”，而且为了要自己立功，竟不管当时的作战计划，要求把第七、第九连调回来，这会是人民解放军指挥员的正确思想吗？
    在创作方法上，《关连长》不是从正面来歌颂人民解放军的高贵品质和英雄事迹，而是大部分从缺点（好多是不真实的缺点）出发，或是用缺点来陪衬优点。像用党员讲怪话：“上级把咱八连当饭桶”、“不相信咱”、“咱吃不开了”等等，来说明党员战斗情绪的高涨，用战士踩青苗来说明关连长的群众观念强，用党员对非党员说：“俺以后每天晚上给你打洗脚水”，用关连长送战士两包烟来说明党员和关连长虚心接受群众意见。用部队只有小孩子送行来说明军民关系融洽；用大学生大讲唯物哲学来说明知识分子以后的转变；用兄弟连队讽刺八连只能看守俘虏来增加八连的盼望战争情绪，用全连咬破指头写请战书来说明人民军队坚强的战斗意志和决心；用犹疑不决、延误战斗时间来说明关连长爱护儿童……等等，像这样的创作方法，就使得作品恰巧收到与作者主观意图相反的坏的效果。
    在题材上，《关连长》所选择的是一个并不典型的事件。影片企图通过这一个不典型的事件来说明“革命的战争是为了后一代”的主题。结果是用小资产阶级庸俗的人道主义代替了革命的人道主义。难道说如果红楼里没有小孩子，那我们的解放战争就不是为了解放全人类，为了后一代吗？这篇作品在取材上说，也是不典型的。
