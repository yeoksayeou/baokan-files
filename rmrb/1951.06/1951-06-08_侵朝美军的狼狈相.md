Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: The US aggressor troops and their puppet forces have suffered another heavy blow from the Chinese and Korean People's Army in their recent foolish moves, and are in a state of utter disarray. A Reuters dispatch on the 3rd revealed the embarrassing situation of a Belgian outpost force on the Western Front crossing the Imjin River to invade the north, being pursued by the Volunteer Army, and the British artillery on the south bank firing in a panic. Reuters quoted Captain Weiliwo, the captain of the outpost, as saying: "It took us about three hours to cross to the north; but thanks to the 'encouragement' of the Chinese army, it took us only thirty-five minutes to return. In addition to the pursuit by the Chinese army, the support cannons of the British army behind us fired extremely 'accurately', preventing us from stopping for a moment. As we were getting into the boat, the last cannonball fell and exploded on the water behind us."

A cable sent by Guo Xin She reporter Han Duoman on the 1st for the Associated Press reporter Baker, Johnson and Guo Xin She reporter Brownlow to the internal agency, revealed the predicament of the US Marine 1st Division being trapped. Han Duoman’s cable said: "This is being sent by electric typewriter after the phone lines went down. I am now sending the entire cable, with items in parentheses that the censor does not allow to be published: 'We are trapped with the Marines in a predicament with no water, no food, no clothes, no showers, and no transportation, and (no hope). (We can't find anything to eat). Jeeps can't move, (the bridge to South Korea has been washed away), and our clothes are torn. Immediately increase our salary by ten dollars and send us your greatest sympathy. Forget about the war for now. We are busy trying to save our lives and have no time to worry about anything else.'"

　　侵朝美军的狼狈相
    【新华社六日讯】美国侵略军及其仆从军队在最近的蠢动中，又遭到中朝人民军队的沉重打击，狼狈不堪。路透社三日的消息透露了西线渡临津江北犯的一支比利时前哨队被志愿军追击及南岸英军炮兵仓皇射击的狼狈相。路透社引前哨队队长卫力沃上尉的话说：“我们费了约三小时才向北渡过去；但由于中国军队的‘鼓励’，我们费了三十五分钟就回来了。除了中国军队的追击以外，在我们后面的英军的支援大炮放得极为‘准确’，使我们不能停留片刻。在我们入船的时候，最后一个炮弹落了下来，在我们身后的水上爆炸开来。”
    国新社记者韩多曼一日为美联社记者贝克尔、约翰逊和国新社记者布朗罗转发给该社内部的告急电报中，透露了美陆战一师的部队被困的窘状。韩多曼的电报说：“这是在电话不通以后用电动打字机发出的。我现在把全部电文发出，括弧内是新闻检查官不许发表的事项：‘我们和陆战队一道陷在没有水、没有食物、没有衣服、淋浴和交通工具，也（没有希望）的困境。（我们找不到吃的东西）。吉普车不能开，（通至南朝鲜的桥梁已被冲坏），衣服已经弄破了。马上给我们增加十元钱的薪水并寄以最大的同情。暂时不要管战争了。我们正在急于求活命，没有工夫管别的事。’”
