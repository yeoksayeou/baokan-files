Introducing Volume 2, Issue 4 of "People's Music"

　　The fourth issue of the second volume of "People's Music," published on June 5th, is a special issue dedicated to the study of folk music. Its content includes three parts: folk music research, introductions to folk music from various regions, and introductions to ethnic minority music. The folk music research section includes two articles by Chen Zhenhua and Guan Zhusheng on methods for improving the erhu. They modified the erhu's two strings to three or four strings, which not only expanded the erhu's range but also retained the original characteristics of the erhu in terms of volume and style. Although this is still a relatively preliminary improvement, it is a beneficial attempt to improve Chinese national music. The section on folk music from various regions includes the lively and powerful Hebei folk song "Pounding Song," the "Sichuan River Boatmen's Work Song" sung by boatmen on the Sichuan River during labor, and the Shanxi folk song "Pushing Fried Noodles," among others. The section introducing ethnic minority music includes the mountain songs and dances of the Sani and Axi ethnic groups in Guixi, Yunnan, the Lusheng music and folk song "Fireside Chorus of Chairman Mao" of the Miao ethnic group in Guizhou, and the Yi folk song "Like a Rooster Crowing at Sunrise." From these songs, we can see how rich the treasure of our national folk music art is, urgently awaiting our efforts to explore and learn from them.

　　介绍二卷四期《人民音乐》
    六月五日出版的第二卷第四期《人民音乐》，是一期民间音乐研究专号，其内容包括三个部分：民间音乐研究、各地民间音乐及少数民族音乐介绍。民间音乐研究部分，其中有两篇是陈振华、关筑声的关于改良二胡的方法介绍。他们将二胡的两根弦改为三根弦或四根弦，不但扩大了二胡的音域，而且在音量、风调上都保有原来二胡的特色。虽然这还是比较初步的改进，但对于改良中国民族音乐却是一种有益的尝试。各地民间音乐介绍部分，有活泼有力的冀东民歌《打夯歌》、四川江上船夫们劳动时唱的《川江船夫号子》、山西民歌《推炒面》等。介绍少数民族音乐的部分有云南圭西的撒尼和阿西族的山歌舞、贵州苗族的芦笙及民歌《炉边合唱毛主席》、彝族民歌《好比鸡叫出太阳》等。从这些歌子里，可以看出我们祖国民间音乐艺术的宝藏是多么丰富，急待我们努力去开采并向它们学习。
