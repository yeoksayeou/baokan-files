　　Responding to the Challenge of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team
　　Seventeen Mutual Aid Teams in Gaodiba Village, Chang'an, Resolve to Mobilize the Entire Village to Sell All Stored Cotton
　　Seventeen mutual aid teams in Gaodiba Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, responded to the patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing competition initiated by the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team in Shanxi. Their challenge conditions are: First, to initiate the establishment of a village cotton-selling and cotton-storing work committee to promote and mobilize all cotton farmers in the village to immediately sell all their stored cotton, more than 700 jin, to the state; and to promote cotton-selling and cotton-storing to nearby villages. Second, to ensure that all stored cotton is dried and cleaned by the end of June. After the village cotton-selling and cotton-storing work committee has initially checked and approved these stored cotton, it will uniformly handle the cotton-selling and cotton-storing procedures, ensuring that production and cotton-selling work are not delayed. Third, to protect this year's cotton seedlings and guarantee an increase of 15 jin of cotton per mu, so that more cotton can be stored and sold to the state after the autumn harvest.
　　Gaodiba Village is one of the cotton-producing areas in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province. Last year, due to insect pests in the cotton fields, the village's cotton production was reduced by 70%. Before planting cotton this year, the Chang'an County People's Government sent cadres to the village to mobilize and organize cotton farmers to universally select cotton seeds, and provided loans for fertilizers, sprayers and other agricultural tools. Therefore, this year's cotton seedlings are particularly strong. The cotton farmers expressed their gratitude for the concern of the People's Government. Therefore, since the seventeen mutual aid teams proposed responding to the patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing competition, all cotton farmers in the village immediately supported it. Now the village's cotton-selling and cotton-storing work committee has been established, and cotton farmers have voluntarily registered to sell more than 360 jin of cotton to the state.

　　Sixteen Mutual Aid Teams in Shiqiao Township, Yanshi, Henan, Guarantee to Sell All Stored Cotton to the State Soon
　　Sixteen mutual aid teams in Shiqiao Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, a central cotton-producing area, under the leadership of Chang Ping'an, a Communist Party member and chairman of the township farmers' association, decided to sell all stored cotton to the state, and challenged the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team in Jie County, Shanxi, while also challenging cotton farmers in other cotton-producing areas of Henan. In their challenge letter, they wrote: All the cotton farmers in Shiqiao Township suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and landlords before liberation. Although we worked all year round and planted cotton on more than 50% of the arable land, we lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear every year. Every spring, all the edible leaves and wild grass in the village were eaten up by us. After liberation, the People's Government gave us various assistance, so that the yield of cotton per mu increased by the equivalent of more than 120 jin of wheat compared with before liberation. Last winter, we all received land. Now our lives have greatly improved. Two hundred and thirty new houses have been built in the township, more than 70 new livestock have been added, 22 households have purchased brand-new vehicles, and almost every household has added agricultural tools. After the land reform, four new wells have been dug and 25 old wells have been repaired in the township. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government can we have the hope of getting rich. Therefore, we resolutely respond to the government's call to sell and store cotton to the state. From June 13th to 16th, in four days, 140 households in our township have sold and stored 3,500 jin of cotton to the state-entrusted organs. Now this patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing movement is in full swing. In order to enable our country's textile industry to obtain the necessary amount of cotton before the new cotton is on the market, we specially challenge the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team in Shanxi and challenge cotton farmers in various cotton-producing areas of Henan. Our conditions are: First, the sixteen mutual aid teams in our township guarantee to sell all stored cotton to the state before June 20th. Second, mobilize cotton farmers who have not joined the mutual aid team to sell more than 95% of their stored cotton to the state before the end of June. Third, educate all cotton farmers in the township to ensure that the cotton sold to the state is not damp, not adulterated, and is cleaned thoroughly. Fourth, to ensure that the work of removing aphids (currently 50% of the cotton fields here are infested with insects) is not affected during the cotton-selling and cotton-storing period.

　　Cotton Farmers in Thirteen Villages in Ronghe County, Shanxi Province, Quickly Sell All Stored Cotton to the State
　　Cotton farmers in thirteen villages, including Liu Village, Xin'an, and Sihou in Ronghe County, a famous cotton-producing area in Shanxi Province, responded to the challenge of the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team. After seeing the instructions of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council on cotton purchasing and storing work, cotton farmers in Xin'an and other thirteen villages actively sold or stored cotton to the state. Liu Village and Sihou Village alone have sold more than 10,000 jin of raw cotton. After the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team challenged mutual aid teams in cotton-producing areas across the country, these thirteen villages held a cotton farmer representative meeting on June 20th, deciding to universally launch a patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing movement, quickly sell all stored cotton to the state, and guarantee to cultivate carefully and strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

　　响应曲耀离互助组挑战
    长安高低堡子村十七个互助组决心动员全村出售全部存棉
    陕西省长安县高低堡子村十七个变工互助组，响应山西曲耀离互助组爱国主义售棉储棉竞赛。他们的应战条件是：一、发起成立村售棉储棉工作委员会，向全村棉农作宣传，动员他们将全部存棉七百多斤立即卖给国家；并向附近农村宣传售棉储棉。二、保证在六月底前把全部存棉晒干，拣净。这些存棉由村售棉储棉工作委员会初步检查合格以后，统一办理售棉储棉手续，做到生产与售棉工作两不误。三、把今年的棉苗保护好，保证每亩增产棉花十五斤，以便秋后能向国家储售更多的棉花。
    高低堡子村为陕西关中棉产区之一，去年因棉田遭受虫害，全村棉花减产百分之七十。今年种棉前，长安县人民政府曾派干部到该村动员和组织棉农普遍进行棉籽粒选，并贷给肥料、喷雾器及其他农具等，所以今年该村棉苗出得特别茁壮。棉农们对于人民政府的关心，莫不表示万分感激，因此自十七个互助组提出响应爱国售棉储棉竞赛以后，全村棉农便立即拥护。现在全村的售棉储棉工作委员会已经组成，棉农自动登记售给国家的棉花已达三百六十多斤。

  河南偃师石桥乡十六个互助组保证早日把全部存棉卖给国家
    河南省偃师县产棉中心区石桥乡十六个互助组，在共产党员乡农会主席常平安的领导下，决定将全部存棉卖给国家，并向山西解县曲耀离互助组应战，同时向河南各产棉区的棉农挑战。他们在应战和挑战书中写道：我们石桥乡的全体棉农在解放前受尽了蒋介石匪帮和地主恶霸的剥削和压迫。虽然我们终年劳动，把百分之五十以上的耕地种了棉花，但是年年都过着吃不饱穿不暖的生活，每年春天，村上所有能吃的树叶和野草都被我们吃光。解放后，人民政府给我们各种扶助，使每亩棉花比解放前增加收益折合麦子一百二十斤以上。去年冬天我们都分到了土地。现在我们的生活已大大改善。全乡盖新房二百三十间，新添牲口七十多头，有二十二户置了全新的车辆，几乎家家都添置了农具。土地改革后，全乡已开凿新井四个，修理旧井二十五个。只有在毛主席和人民政府的领导下，我们才有发家的希望。因此我们坚决响应政府的号召，向国家售棉、储棉。从六月十三日到十六日四天中，我们全乡已有一百四十户向国家委托的机关售出和储存棉花三千五百斤。现在这种爱国的售棉、储棉运动正在热烈进行着。为了使咱们国家的纺织工业在新棉上市前获得必需数量的棉花，我们特向山西曲耀离互助组应战，并向河南各产棉区的棉农挑战。我们的条件是：一、我们全乡十六个互助组保证在六月二十日前将全部存棉卖给国家。二、动员未参加互助组的棉农在六月底以前把百分之九十五以上的存棉卖给国家。三、教育全乡棉农将卖给国家的棉花不使潮、不掺假、检得干净。四、保证在售棉、储棉期间，不影响除蚜虫（目前这里的棉田百分之五十发生虫害）的工作。（新华社）
  山西省荣河县十三村棉农迅速把存棉扫数卖给国家
    山西著名产棉区荣河县的刘村、新安、寺后等十三村棉农向曲耀离互助组应战。新安等十三村棉农们看到中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，即积极出售或向国家储存棉花，仅刘村、寺后两村已出售原棉一万余斤。曲耀离互助组向全国产棉区互助组挑战后，这十三个村又于六月二十日举行了棉农代表会议，决定普遍开展爱国主义的售棉储棉运动，迅速地将存棉扫数卖给国家，并保证精耕细作，争取今年棉花丰产。（新华社）
