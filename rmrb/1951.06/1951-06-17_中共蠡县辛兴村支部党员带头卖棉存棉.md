中共 Lixian Xin'xing Village Branch
    Party Members Take the Lead in Selling and Storing Cotton

The Communist Party members of Xin'xing Village in the Fifth District of Lixian County, Hebei Province, responding to the Party's call, actively encouraged the masses who stored cotton to sell and store cotton to the state. After studying the call of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on carrying out the patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign, the party members of Xin'xing Village all believed that Communist Party members should play an exemplary role. Party member Jin Ping'an said: "I have two hundred catties of cotton, and I want to store it for the country to directly support the production of the machine textile industry." Party member Li Gengshen patiently persuaded his family to sell all the stored cotton to the state. The family only sold one hundred catties the first time; after his continued mobilization, they sold another fifty catties; finally, after repeated mobilization, the family took out all the remaining two hundred catties of cotton and sold it to the state. Female party member Liu Xiaorong learned that her mother-in-law's family still had forty catties of cotton stored, so she asked party member Li Xiaomiao to help her persuade her mother-in-law, and as a result, all of it was sold to the state.

The party members, on the one hand, set an example by selling and storing cotton, and on the other hand, mobilized cotton-storing households to follow suit. After some discussion, everyone believed that the households with more cotton stored at present were those who planted more cotton last year but did not build houses or buy land. There were more than 120 households in the village with more cotton stored. Therefore, the party members divided into groups and went to different areas and households to mobilize. Party members Li Xiaomiao, Li Jinxiang, and Liu Xiaorong mobilized ten households separately in one afternoon, selling 1,085 catties of cotton. Under the active leadership and persuasion of the party members, the entire village sold and stored 13,845 catties of cotton to the state in five days. Now the party members are continuing to carry out patriotic propaganda and education to the cotton-storing households, striving to mobilize all the stored cotton. (Zhi Qing)

　　中共蠡县辛兴村支部        
    党员带头卖棉存棉
    河北蠡县五区辛兴村的共产党员，响应党的号召，积极带动存棉群众向国家卖棉存棉。辛兴村的支部党员学习了中共河北省委关于开展爱国主义售棉储棉运动的号召后，都认为共产党员应该起模范作用。党员晋平安说：“我有二百斤棉花，要存给国家，直接支持机器纺织工业生产。”党员李庚申耐心说服家长，把存棉全卖给国家。第一次家里只卖了一百斤；经他继续动员，又卖了五十斤；最后经过反复动员，家里把还剩下的二百斤棉花，全拿出来卖给国家。妇女党员刘小荣知道婆婆家还存着四十来斤棉花，就让党员李小苗帮助她说服婆婆，结果也全卖给了国家。
    党员们一面以身作则卖棉存棉，一面动员存棉户跟着作。大家讨论了一下，认为眼下存棉多的户，都是去年种棉多，而又没有盖房买地的户。全村有一百二十多户存棉较多。于是，党员们就划分小组，分片分户去动员。党员李小苗、李金祥和刘小荣三人，一晌午分头动员了十户，卖出一千零八十五斤棉花，在党员积极带动和劝说下，全村五天卖给、存给国家一万三千八百四十五斤棉花。现在党员们正在继续对存棉户进行爱国主义的宣传教育，争取把所有存棉都动员出来。（志清）
