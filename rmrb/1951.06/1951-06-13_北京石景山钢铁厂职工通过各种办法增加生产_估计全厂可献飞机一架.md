　　Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers Increase Production Through Various Methods
    Estimated the Entire Plant Can Donate a Plane

To the Editor:

    The patriotic movement of donating airplanes and cannons to resist America and aid Korea has been vigorously unfolding in our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Under the correct guidance of the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League, our plant's donation movement is being closely integrated with increasing production.

    In order not to lower the current living standards of the workers, the Party Committee of our plant pointed out: the donation movement should actively find ways to increase production, and through this movement, production should be improved. It is necessary to mobilize workers to put forward rationalization proposals to increase income and bonuses, and donate all or part of the increased income and bonuses to buy airplanes. In this way, the donation movement is closely integrated with improving production. Our plant’s workers responded to the Party Committee’s call and held various meetings to formulate methods to increase production in order to donate airplanes and tanks. The workers of the Transportation Department are determined to combine the elimination of accidents with the donation movement, and strive to improve the turnover rate of railway cars. The administration originally stipulated that each railway car should be used one and a half times a day; now the workers voluntarily propose to use each railway car twice a day. If it exceeds twice, for example, if it rises to 2.1 times, it will save 8 million yuan a day. The administration decided to reward the workers with this saved money, and the workers donate it to buy weapons.

    In the past, the ash content of the coke (burning Fengfeng coal) produced by the Coking Department was always around 13 percent. After the donation movement started, everyone worked hard to reduce the ash content. Xu Zhaoyu's group has reduced it to 8.1 or 8.2 percent, and the recovery rate has also reached 74 percent. Workers add extra shifts to dig mud coal pits and turn over coke fines to earn extra income to buy weapons to support the volunteers. In recent days, workers and engineers have jointly put forward many rationalization proposals.

    In addition to universally and enthusiastically donating, the workers in the Repair Department also guarantee accurate work estimates and promise to use their brains to complete the tasks given by the administration ahead of schedule. The workers in the Power Department and the Iron Smelting Department guarantee safe operation and safe production. The workers in the Power Department also contracted extra projects and have already sent people to the Yongding River to see the project site, preparing to donate these extra income in the future. In addition to improving the yield rate, some of the workers in the Foundry Department voluntarily inspect scrap iron, and some of the workers contract to organize and sort out assets, preparing to use the remuneration from these tasks to buy airplanes. All the odd-job workers in the plant are preparing to step up leveling the material yard, inspecting scrap iron, and repairing toilets, and donate the income from these tasks. All the guards are preparing to participate in voluntary labor and donate their wages. It seems that with the joint efforts of all the workers, it is not a problem for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to donate an airplane.

　　北京石景山钢铁厂职工通过各种办法增加生产        
    估计全厂可献飞机一架编辑同志：
    捐献飞机大炮的抗美援朝爱国运动，已在我们石景山钢铁厂热烈地展开。在党、行政、工会、青年团的正确指导下，我厂的捐献运动正与增加生产紧密结合进行中。
    为了不降低职工目前的生活水平，本厂中共党委会指出：捐献运动应该在生产上积极想办法，要通过这个运动，使生产提高一步。要发动职工提出合理化建议，以增加收入，增加奖金，把多得的收入和奖金的全部或一部捐献出来买飞机。这样，捐献运动就和提高生产密切结合起来了。我们全厂职工响应党委的号召，纷纷举行各式各样的会议，拟订为了捐献飞机坦克而增加生产的办法。运输部的职工们决心把消灭事故和捐献运动相结合，要努力提高车皮周转率。行政上原定每一个车皮每天要使用一次半；现在工人自动地提出要使每一个车皮每天使用二次。如果超过了二次，比方说提高到二点一次，一天就要节省八百万元，行政上决定把这笔节省的钱奖给工人，工人捐献出来购买武器。
    炼焦部过去所炼焦炭（烧峰峰煤）灰份总在百分之十三左右，捐献运动开始后，大伙努力降低灰份，徐兆瑜小组已降低到百分之八点一、二了，收回率也达到百分之七十四。工人们每天加点挖泥煤坑，翻焦末，争取获得额外收入，购买武器支援志愿军。这几天来，工人和工程师合作提了许多合理化建议。
    修理部工人除了普遍热烈捐献外，还保证正确估工，保证开动脑筋，提前完成行政给与的任务。动力部和炼铁部的工人，保证要安全运转和安全生产。动力部的工人还额外包了工程，已经派人到永定河去看工程地点，准备将来把这些额外收入捐献出来。铸造部工人除了提高成品率以外，一部分职工自动去检废铁，一部分职工包作整理资财工作，准备把这些工作的报酬拿来买飞机。全厂的勤杂工人准备加紧平料场、检废铁、修厕所，把这些工作所得的收入捐献出来。全厂警卫士兵都准备参加义务劳动，捐献所得工资。看情形，石景山钢铁厂在全厂职工的共同努力下，捐献一架飞机是不成问题的。
