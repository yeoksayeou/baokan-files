　　Mayevsky, the Pravda correspondent in London, commented on the achievements of this national conference of the British Peace Committee, pointing out that the conference showed that despite the slander campaigns by bourgeois newspapers and the various attempts by reactionaries to incite war hysteria, more and more British people are feeling the growing threat of warmongers and are rising up in resistance. The rich results of the conference are a new contribution to uniting all democratic forces in Britain to further expand and strengthen the sacred struggle for peace.

    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦消息：九日在伦敦举行的英国和平委员会全国会议，已于十日闭幕。会议的丰富成果受到了英国人民的热烈庆贺。
    在两天的全国会议上，代表们纷纷发言，号召加强和扩大争取和平的斗争，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，要求缔结五大国和平公约。会议的四个委员会分别作了反对武装西德及日本、反对重整军备、反对战争宣传及民族仇恨宣传，和要求加强国际联系与合作的报告。
    英国和平委员会书记琼斯在总结会议工作时说：去年十一月时全国共有地方和平委员会二百个，而现在这数目已增加到三百个，到今年十一月时一定会增加到六百个。
    会议表扬了普利穆斯一位年老的退休工人科林斯，他曾为要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言征集了一千多人的签名。会议并选出了英国和平委员会的新的全国委员会，有委员八十人。
    在全国会议闭幕的那一天，伦敦一万五千人民在特拉法尔加广场举行庆祝大会。大会由著名的进步记者夏菲尔主持。他在会上说：英国和平运动已经成长，已经扩大为全国性的运动了。会上发言者一致强调指出加紧为和平而奋斗的必要，而号召争取为和平公约宣言征集数百万人的签名。
    真理报驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基在评论英国和平委员会这次全国会议的成就时指出：会议显示了，纵然资产阶级报纸进行诽谤运动，纵然反动派多方设法煽动战争歇斯底里，但是英国的人民愈来愈多地感觉到战争贩子的威胁日益增长，并且奋起反抗。会议的丰富成果对于联合英国全体爱好民主的力量以进一步扩大和加强神圣的争取和平的斗争来说，是一种新的贡献。
