A response to the People's Daily readers' criticisms and suggestions column:

To the Editor:
    The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 21 published the criticism from the Xingtai Special District Directly Subordinate Grain Depot regarding our company's non-compliance with grain rationing regulations. We have already conducted an investigation into this matter. Our company's leadership cadres did not provide sufficient education to our comrades, leading to some comrades violating discipline and making the mistake of not complying with warehouse regulations. In addition to a deep self-criticism, we have used this matter as an example to educate all comrades in our company. Furthermore, we have given criticism and education to the comrades who violated discipline and urged them to make self-criticisms, guaranteeing that they will never make such mistakes again in the future. In order to further strengthen the relationship between the troops and local authorities, we hope that the Xingtai Special District Directly Subordinate Grain Depot will provide us with more assistance in our work in the future.

            Public Security Unit X, 11th Company

### 公安部队某部第十一连  关于不遵守支粮制度的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　公安部队某部第十一连  关于不遵守支粮制度的检讨编辑同志：
    五月二十一日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登了邢台专区直属粮库对我连不遵守支粮制度的批评。这个问题，我们已经进行了检查。我连领导干部对同志教育不够，以致造成少数同志违反纪律，不遵守仓库制度的错误；我们除深刻地检讨外，并把这事做例子对我全连同志进行了教育。此外，我们已给违反纪律的同志以批评教育，并督促他作了自我批评，保证今后决不再犯这种错误。为了使部队和地方机关的关系更加密切，我们希望邢台专区直属粮库今后在工作上给我们以更多的帮助。
            公安某部十一连
