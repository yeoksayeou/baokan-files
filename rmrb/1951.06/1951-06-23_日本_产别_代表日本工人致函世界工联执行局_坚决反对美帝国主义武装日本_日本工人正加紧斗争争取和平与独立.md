Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: TASS, 16th: According to reports from Tokyo, the executive committee of the All Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations (abbreviated as "Sanbetsu"), representing Japanese workers, sent a letter to the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions regarding the upcoming meeting in Vienna to discuss the issue of opposing the arming of Japan. The letter stated, "Japanese workers are deeply concerned about this meeting and place great hopes on it."

The letter emphasized: "The imperialists, who are plotting a separate peace treaty with Japan, are arming Japan and turning it into a war base for aggression. They are exploiting Japan's colonial labor conditions, under the guise of so-called US-Japan economic cooperation, to transform Japan's economy into a part of the US economy for war preparation and expansion. In order to realize the above plan, the imperialists and their Japanese accomplices are using the following means: implementing wage controls characteristic of wartime, laying off workers in large numbers to implement capitalist rationalization, worsening labor laws, prohibiting strikes in key industrial sectors of Japan, and so on."

The letter pointed out that the draft treaties on the so-called peace treaty with Japan, the US-Japan defense alliance, and the Pacific Pact, all orchestrated by the likes of Dulles, demonstrate the imperialists' intention to have foreign troops stationed in Japan even after the conclusion of the peace treaty, and to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder when invading Asia.

The letter also pointed out that the Japanese people are opposing the shameless militarization and colonialization plans. They are being brutally suppressed by the reactionaries. Citing the example of the destruction of the "Laborer" newspaper, the letter stated, "These facts clearly show that the imperialist elements who are attempting to restore their power in Japan are brutally undermining the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's sixteen principles regarding Japanese trade unions."

The letter declared that Japanese workers are intensifying their struggle for peace and Japanese independence. Demands for wage increases have been raised everywhere. In many factories manufacturing military equipment, the movement to resist the production of military supplies has developed into open strikes. The slogans of striving for an overall peace treaty and opposing the rearmament of Japan have become the unanimous slogans of all Japanese workers. In the signature campaign launched by the Patriotic Movement Council for Overall Peace, three million signatures have already been collected. Right-wing trade unions are also collecting signatures. The "May Day" festival was celebrated across the country under this slogan.

The Executive Committee continued, stating that the resolutions passed by the Berlin Conference of the World Peace Council are in line with the wishes of all peace-loving Japanese people. The "Sanbetsu" Executive Committee has called for the collection of signatures for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and opposition to the rearmament of Japan, and is also collecting signatures for the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact. The Executive Committee is doing its utmost to organize peace committees in various enterprises in Japan.

The letter then emphasized that international support has inspired many Japanese workers who are fighting for peace and independence, giving them confidence in victory.

Next, the "Sanbetsu" Executive Committee harshly criticized the right-wing splittists who are colluding with the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the leaders of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Minoru Takano and Takeo Muto, and others, because they are forcing Japan to accept a separate peace treaty and rearmament, thereby pushing Japanese workers into the abyss of a new world war.

The letter continued, "We want to unite the entire Japanese working class (including members of trade unions participating in the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) to fight against all kinds of sectarianism."

In conclusion, the Executive Committee stated: "No matter what, the connection between Japanese workers and the World Federation of Trade Unions cannot be destroyed, and we will fight to the end under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions."

　　日本“产别”代表日本工人致函世界工联执行局
    坚决反对美帝国主义武装日本
    日本工人正加紧斗争争取和平与独立
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社十六日讯：据东京消息，全日本产业别工会会议（简称“产别”）执行委员会代表日本工人，就世界工会联合会执行局行将在维也纳举行会议讨论关于反对武装日本问题，致函世界工联执行局。该信说：“日本工人深为关心这个会议，对它寄予很大的希望。”
    该信强调指出：“阴谋单独对日媾和的帝国主义者正在武装日本，把它变为进行侵略的战争基地。他们正利用日本的殖民地劳动条件，在所谓美日经济合作的掩饰下，把日本的经济变作美国进行备战与扩张的经济的一部分。帝国主义者及其日本的帮凶为了实现上述计划，就使用下列各种手段：实施战时所特有的工资管制，大批解雇工人以实行资本主义的合理化，恶化劳动法，禁止日本主要工业部门罢工以及其他等等。”
    该信指出：杜勒斯之流一手包办的所谓关于对日和约、美日防御联盟与太平洋公约等项草案，说明了帝国主义者的意图是：即使缔结和约以后外国军队还是要驻扎在日本，并且要在进犯亚洲的时候利用日本人民当炮灰。
    该信同时指出：日本人民正在反对无耻的军国主义化与殖民地化计划。他们受到反动派的残酷镇压。信中引《劳动者》报遭受破坏的例子说道：“这些事实明显说明，企图在日本恢复其势力的帝国主义分子们，正在横暴地破坏波茨坦公告与远东委员会关于日本工会的十六项原则。”
    该信宣称：日本工人正加紧进行争取和平与日本独立的斗争。各地都提出了增加工资的要求。在许多制造军备的工厂中，反抗生产军事物资的运动已发展为公开的罢工。争取全面和约、反对重新武装日本的口号，已成了日本全体工人的一致口号。在由全面媾和爱国运动协议会发起的征集签名运动中，已经征集了三百万个签名。右翼工会也征集着签名。全国各地并在这个口号下度过了“五一”节。
    执委会继续写道：世界和平理事会柏林会议通过的决议，符合全体爱好和平的日本人民的愿望。“产别”执委会已号召为争取缔结全面和约、反对重新武装日本而征集签名，同时并为世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言征集签名。执委会正在竭尽全力在日本各企业中组织和平委员会。
    该信继而强调指出：国际的声援鼓舞了许多为争取和平与独立而奋斗的日本劳动者，给他们以胜利的信心。
    接着，“产别”执委会严词批评了与“国际自由工会联合会”有勾搭的右翼分裂分子以及日本工会总评议会的领袖高野实与武藤武雄以及其他等人，因为他们强迫日本接受单独和约与重新武装，从而把日本工人推进新世界大战的深渊。
    该信继称：“我们要团结日本全体工人阶级（包括参加日本工会总评议会各工会的会员在内），为反对各种宗派而斗争。”
    执委会在结语中说：不论怎样，“日本工人与世界工联之间的联系是绝对破坏不了的，我们要在世界工联的旗帜下战斗到底。”
