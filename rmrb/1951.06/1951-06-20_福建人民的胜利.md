　　The Victory of the People of Fujian
　　Special Correspondent for this newspaper, Liu Yuefeng
　　In the twenty-two months since liberation, Fujian Province has annihilated more than 68,000 bandits, and the province has basically eradicated all bandit gangs. The twelve million people of the province have begun to live a life of peace and prosperity, and the Kuomintang bandit gang's armed secret agents lurking in Fujian have suffered a fatal blow.

　　　　　　One, Many Mountains and Forests, Bandits Everywhere
　　Fujian is one of the great forest regions of our great motherland. The province is mountainous and forested, and transportation is inconvenient. Over the years, with the support of the reactionary ruling class, bandits have run rampant, constantly harming the people. In the late Qing Dynasty, the landlord class in Fujian Province competed to establish "militias" to rule the peasants with this reactionary armed force. Later, feudal warlords and the Kuomintang reactionary government repeatedly reorganized these bandit-like "militias" into "civilian armies," "regular armies," or "provincial defense forces." These bandits, under the banner of "regular armies," continued to rob openly and steal secretly, rape, and kill. From 1931 to 1932, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by the Communist Party of China, attacked these reactionary armed forces and bandits. In the more than ten years from 1933 to 1945, the bandit armed forces in Fujian, under the command of Kuomintang reactionary chieftains such as Chen Yi, were sometimes unified into "security regiments" or local reactionary troops, and sometimes disintegrated due to internal infighting and turned into open roaming bandits. From years of experience, the people have seen that bandits, the Kuomintang government, and local bullies are three in one. For example, the notorious bandit leader Yan Zheng in northern Fujian was a local bully and landlord, who had been a bandit or an "official" for twenty years. He served as the Kuomintang's "security captain," "director of the Taining branch of the Fujian branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League," "National Assembly representative," and "commander of the Fujian-Jiangxi People's Self-Defense Force"; after liberation, he fled and became a bandit again and has now been captured and executed by the People's Government. Lin Qinglong, who was entrenched in Dehua and whose family had been bandits for three generations, was also a large landlord and a "regiment commander" of the Kuomintang reactionary army.
　　On the eve of the liberation of Fujian, U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang systematically left behind a large number of bandits and secret agents in Fujian, unified the originally scattered bandit armed forces, and provided them with Tommy guns, carbines, light and heavy machine guns, and American-style transceivers to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Fujian, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan maintained contact with the bandits on the mainland, and secret agents and small groups of remnant bandits constantly sneaked in from the sea to support and command the bandits in the territory, actively engaging in sabotage activities, which caused a rather serious bandit situation in Fujian before and after liberation.

　　　　　　Two, Arduous Bandit Suppression Struggle
　　In the autumn of 1949, Fujian Province was basically liberated. In order to eliminate banditry and build a new Fujian for the people, the Party, government, army, and people of Fujian Province launched an arduous bandit suppression struggle. After suffering the first stage of fierce attacks, the bandits changed their methods of activity, fleeing into the mountains and forests to continue harming the people. In this way, the bandit suppression struggle unfolded in the deep mountains and dense forests. In order to encircle a large mountain, our troops had to build houses on the encirclement line. These houses were made of thatch, branches, wild vines, or bamboo. The grain eaten by the soldiers was carried over several mountains; the vegetables were bamboo shoots and sweet potato leaves. The Liancheng and Qingliu areas in western Fujian are full of continuous mountains, with chilling winds and pervasive fog morning and evening. The dense pine forests are full of wild vines and thorns. Once, the fourth and fifth squads of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army discovered a cave in this mountain. The cave was on a steep cliff, with no tree roots or vines to climb. The soldiers immediately formed "human ladders" and climbed into the cave one by one to search. Zhou Baofa, the deputy company commander of a certain company, broke his hand and broke his gun while searching Zhushan, northeast of Dakengyuan, but he still led his troops in pursuit, and finally killed the bandit "Commander of the Third Detachment of the Anti-Communist Free Army Western Fujian Guerrilla General Headquarters" Xiao Chongzi. When a certain unit annihilated the bandit "Provisional Fourth Division," they marched 130 li through the rugged mountain road in the rain at night. Many comrades were suffering from malaria, but they continued to fight with the army. In order not to give the bandits a chance to escape, the soldiers endured hunger and fatigue and bravely pursued. Comrade Wang Huanzheng and others from a certain company fainted on the mountain while searching, and continued to pursue after waking up, finally capturing the bandit "Commander of the Provisional Fourth Division of the Northern Fujian Special Strike Command" Zheng Changji.
　　With the efforts of our bandit suppression troops, from August 1949 to March of this year, a total of 1,147 bandit leaders above the battalion commander level, including the bandit "Commander-in-Chief" Tang Zong, were killed or captured, and more than 68,000 bandits were annihilated, and the province's bandit gangs were basically wiped out.

　　　　　　Three, Mass Bandit Suppression Movement
　　During this period, large groups of bandits were constantly annihilated by the bandit suppression troops, and some of the defeated bandits and small groups of bandits that had been deliberately dispersed continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities; and for a long time, many local governments had a "boundless leniency" bias towards the arrested counter-revolutionaries, so the bandit situation in Fujian was still quite serious. For example, the bandit situation in the Jian'ou area was originally very serious, but from the liberation in May 1949 to the end of that year, only four bandits and secret agents were shot; from January to August 1950, a total of 4,061 bandits were annihilated, but not a single bandit leader was executed. The masses expressed dissatisfaction with this, and were afraid of bandit retaliation, and dared not report the news to the government.
　　After the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court issued instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, the people's governments at all levels in Fujian Province resolutely corrected the "boundless leniency" bias, and immediately arrested and executed a group of notorious bandit leaders, habitual bandits, secret agents, local bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the bandit suppression struggle rose sharply. Under the encouragement of the land reform and Resist America, Aid Korea movements throughout the province, a mass bandit suppression movement was launched throughout the province.
　　The bandits in various places adopted a decentralized and concealed mode of operation under our military strikes, but this did not escape the eyes and attacks of the broad masses. Young and middle-aged people in the countryside actively participated in the militia and self-defense forces and joined the bandit suppression struggle. The militia and masses of Nanjing, Gutian, and other counties held joint rallies of five or six thousand people to suppress bandits. The militia brought their own dry food and searched the mountains for ten days and a half months. The militia of Lingkeng, Guanan, and other four townships in the fifth district of Minhou learned on February 14 that a group of bandits had sneaked in from Dongrong Island and immediately united to encircle and suppress them in the mountains at the junction of the four townships. The militia built thatched sheds around the mountains and tightly surrounded them, and then organized mobile militia groups to search the mountains. Once bandits were found, they would track them down. By the 25th, they had captured 52 bandit leaders and bandits. The militia of the seventh district of Gutian County camped out in the snow for more than 20 days in January and February, and did not go home for the Spring Festival. Finally, they joined the troops to eliminate the stubborn bandits.
　　The experience of the bandit suppression struggle in Fujian Province once again proves that a mass bandit suppression movement is one of the decisive conditions for thoroughly and completely annihilating bandits. In the past twenty months, the militia in Fujian has cooperated with the main forces in 5,829 battles in the bandit suppression struggle, and has served as guides, scouts, and messengers in countless military services, effectively assisting the troops in eliminating bandit gangs. According to incomplete statistics (missing materials from one district), the militia launched 4,514 separate attacks, killing 1,149 bandits, wounding 875, and capturing 7,454 alive; under the attack and persuasion of the militia, 8,304 bandits repented and surrendered. The militia annihilated a total of 17,782 bandits. The militia seized 18,975 various guns from the bandits.
　　The heroic militia cooperated with the coastal defense troops, vigilantly guarding the long coastline of 2,841 kilometers day and night. Coastal areas have established militia coastal defense teams, taking turns on night duty and patrolling, resolutely preventing remnant bandits from sneaking into the mainland from the sea.

　　　　　　Four, Strive for Greater Victory
　　The elimination of bandit gangs is an unprecedented event of great joy for the people of Fujian. The people of Fujian can now freely cultivate the land. In some deep mountains that have always been called "bandit dens," joyful songs are now floating: "Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining brightly wherever he goes..." In the era of rampant bandits under Kuomintang rule, overseas Chinese needed to keep remittances from abroad secret. If the landlords and bad people in the village knew that a family of overseas Chinese had received remittances, bandits would definitely kidnap them within three days. Therefore, there was a saying in some places that "overseas remittances do not last overnight." However, the situation is different today. Relatives of overseas Chinese can talk about receiving remittances on the street, and there are almost no more kidnappings. With the elimination of bandit gangs, land reform, Resist America, Aid Korea, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas have also developed rapidly.
　　However, the military and civilians of Fujian have not become arrogant and complacent because of the above achievements. People clearly know that although bandit gangs have been basically eliminated, Taiwan Province and Jinmen Island in Fujian have not yet been liberated, and bandits and secret agents at sea still attempt to sneak in and cause trouble from time to time. More than a thousand scattered remnant bandits and lurking counter-revolutionaries on the mainland remain to be eliminated. Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, called on everyone at the Fujian Military Region Militia Representative Conference on April 17: In order to ensure social peace in Fujian and to ensure that the 12 million people live and work in peace and contentment, we must continue to attack all counter-revolutionaries to prevent them from continuing to do evil. To completely eliminate bandits, complete land reform throughout the province, eliminate feudal forces, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Taiwan, and further develop the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Only in this way can the people's peace and prosperity be guaranteed.
　　The mass movement to eliminate bandits in Fujian Province is continuing to unfold.

　　福建人民的胜利
    本报特约记者　刘岳峰
    福建省在解放后的二十二个月内，歼灭土匪六万八千余名，全省股匪已基本肃清。全省一千二百万人民，开始获得了安居乐业的生活，蒋家匪帮潜伏在福建的特务武装，已受了致命的打击。
            一、多山多林，土匪成群
    福建是我们伟大祖国的大林区之一。全省多山多林，交通不便。历年来，在反动统治阶级支持下，土匪横行霸道，时时为害人民。满清末年，福建省地主阶级曾竞办“团练”，以这种反动武装统治农民。后来，封建军阀及国民党反动政府，又数次把这些盗匪性质的“团练”改编为“民军”、“正规军”或“省防军”。这些打着“正规军”旗号的土匪，仍是明抢暗夺、奸淫烧杀。一九三一年至一九三二年，中共领导的中国工农红军曾打击了这些反动武装和土匪。一九三三年至一九四五年的十多年中，福建的土匪武装在国民党反动派匪首陈仪等统率下，有时被统一为“保安团”或地方反动部队，有时又因其内部互相倾轧、火并而溃散，变为公开的流寇盗匪。人民从多年的经验中，看清了土匪、国民党政府和地主恶霸是三位一体的。如闽北的惯匪头子严正，是当地的大恶霸地主，二十年来，时而为匪，时而为“官”。他当过国民党的“保安队长”、“三民主义青年团福建支团泰宁分团主任”、“国大代表”、“闽赣民众自卫队指挥官”；解放后又流窜为匪，现已被人民政府捕获正法。盘踞在德化的子孙三代都当土匪的林青龙也是大地主，同时又是国民党反动军队的“团长”。
    福建解放前夕，美帝国主义和蒋匪帮在福建有计划地留下了大批的匪徒和特务，并把原来分散的土匪武装统一起来，发给他们汤姆、卡宾、轻重机枪，以及美式收发报机，使他们进行反革命活动。福建解放以后，台湾的美蒋匪帮与陆地上的土匪保持着联系，特务分子、零星小股的残匪不断地从海上潜入，支持和指挥境内的土匪，积极从事破坏活动，这就造成了福建解放前后一度颇为严重的匪情。
            二、艰苦的剿匪斗争
    一九四九年秋，福建全省已基本解放。为了肃清匪患，建设人民的新福建，福建省党、政、军、民又展开了艰苦的剿匪斗争。土匪遭受了第一阶段的猛烈打击之后，变换了活动方式，窜入大山森林，继续残害人民。这样，剿匪斗争便在深山密林中展开了。为了包剿一座大山，我们的部队曾经必须在包围线上搭盖房子。这些房子是用茅草、树枝、野藤或竹子搭成。战士们吃的粮食是翻过几座大山挑来的菜；是毛竹笋和山芋叶子。闽西连城、清流地区，尽是绵延大山，早晚寒风凛凛，雾气弥漫。茂密的松林里，到处是野藤荆棘。某次，解放军某连四、五班在这座大山中发现了一个山洞。山洞在陡壁上，壁上连树根、草藤全没有，无法攀登。战士们立刻成“肉梯子”，挨次爬进山洞搜索。某连副连长周保发，在搜索大坑源东北的竹山时，手摔破了，枪也跌坏了，但仍率领部队追击，终把匪“反共自由军闽西游击总队第三支队司令”萧铳子击毙。某部在歼灭匪“暂四师”的时候，在崎岖的山路上，冒雨黑夜行军一百三十里，其中不少同志正患疟疾，但他们继续随军作战。为了不使土匪有逃跑的机会，战士们忍着饥饿和疲劳，奋勇追击。某连王焕正等同志，搜山时昏倒在山上，醒来后又继续追击，终于俘获了匪“闽北特击司令部暂编第四师”师长郑长吉。
    在我军剿匪部队的努力下，从一九四九年八月，到今年三月，共毙俘匪“总司令”唐宗以下、大队长以上的匪首一千一百四十七名，歼灭土匪六万八千余名，全省股匪遂告基本肃清。
            三、群众性的剿匪运动
    在这一段时间内，大股土匪不断被剿匪部队歼灭，有些被击溃的股匪和有计划分散了的小股土匪，仍然继续进行反革命活动；而在一个较长的时间里，许多地方政府对被捕的反革命分子，又有着“宽大无边”的偏向，所以，福建匪情还是相当严重的。如建瓯专区的匪情原很严重，但自一九四九年五月解放至当年年底，却只枪毙了四个土匪和特务；一九五○年一至八月共歼灭土匪四千零六十一名，但没有处决一个匪首。群众对此表示不满，又因为怕土匪报复，也不敢向政府报告消息。
    中央人民政府政务院和最高人民法院发布了关于镇压反革命活动的指示，福建省各级人民政府坚决纠正了“宽大无边”的偏向后，立即逮捕和处决了一批罪恶昭彰的匪首、惯匪、特务、恶霸和反动会道门头子。这一来，群众参加剿匪斗争的热情高涨起来了。在全省土地改革、抗美援朝运动的鼓舞下，群众性的剿匪运动在全省范围内风起云涌地展开了。
    各地土匪在我军事打击下，采取了分散的隐蔽活动方式，但这并没有逃出广大群众的眼睛和打击。农村中的青壮年纷纷参加民兵、自卫队，投入了剿匪斗争。南靖、古田等县的民兵和群众，都先后举行了五、六千人的联合大会剿。民兵自己带着干粮，十天半月地围山搜索土匪。闽侯五区灵坑、瓜南等四个乡的民兵，于二月十四日获悉新自东榕岛潜入土匪一股，马上联合起来，到四乡交界地区的大山去围剿。民兵们在大山周围搭起茅棚，严密围困，然后组织机动民兵小组满山搜索，一发现土匪就跟踪直追；至二十五日，即捉到匪首、匪众五十二名。古田县七区民兵在一、二月间的剿匪中，雪夜露营达二十多天，春节都不回家，终于和部队一起消灭了顽匪。
    福建省剿匪斗争的经验再一次证明，群众性的剿匪运动，是彻底地、全部地歼灭土匪的决定条件之一。二十多个月以来，福建的民兵在剿匪斗争中，配合主力部队作战五千八百二十九次，并无数次地担任了带路、侦察、送信等军事勤务，有力地协助部队肃清了股匪。据不完全的统计（缺一个分区的材料），民兵单独出击四千五百十四次，打死土匪一千一百四十九名，打伤八百七十五名，活捉七千四百五十四名；在民兵的打击与争取下，自新与投降的土匪八千三百零四名。民兵共计歼灭土匪一万七千七百八十二名。民兵从土匪手中缴获的各种枪支达一万八千九百七十五枝。
    英勇的民兵们配合海防部队，日夜严密警卫在二千八百四十一公里的漫长的海岸线上。沿海地区都已成立了民兵海防队，轮流值夜，巡逻，坚决不让海上残匪潜入大陆。
            四、为更大的胜利而斗争
    股匪肃清，这是福建人民空前的大喜事。福建人民已经能够在田地上自由地耕作了。在一些一向被称作“匪窝”的深山里，如今也都飘荡起欢乐的歌声：“毛主席像太阳，照到那里那里亮……。”在国民党统治下土匪如麻的时代，华侨从国外汇款回来，是需要保守秘密的。那家侨眷收到侨汇，如果被村里的地主、坏人知道了，不过三天，就一定有土匪来绑票。因此有些地方流传着“侨汇不过夜”的说法。但是，今天的情况不同了，侨眷收到了侨汇，可在大街上随便讲，几乎再也没有绑票的事情了。随着股匪的肃清，土地改革，抗美援朝，城乡物资交流等工作，也得到了迅速的发展。
    但是，福建的军民并没有因为有了上述成绩而骄傲麻痹。人们清楚地知道：股匪虽已基本肃清，但面对着福建的台湾省和金门岛尚未解放，海上的土匪、特务还时时企图潜入作乱，大陆上分散的残匪一千多人和潜伏的反革命分子，也待继续肃清。福建省人民政府张鼎丞主席在四月十七日的福建军区民兵代表会上号召大家：要使福建的社会安宁，一千二百万人民完全安居乐业，就要继续打击一切反革命分子，使它不敢继续作恶。要彻底消灭土匪，完成全省的土地改革，消灭封建势力，支援解放军解放金门、台湾，还要深入开展抗美援朝运动，只有这样，人民的安居乐业才有保障。
    福建省群众性的肃清土匪运动，正继续开展着。
