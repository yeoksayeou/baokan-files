　　Four-Power Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting Declares Breakdown
　　Gromyko Accuses US, Britain, and France of Deliberately Sabotaging the Meeting
　　and Reveals that the North Atlantic Group is Intensifying Preparations for Aggressive War
　　[Xinhua News Agency, June 24th] The meeting of the assistants to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held its 74th meeting, its last, on the 21st. At this meeting, due to the refusal of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to continue the meeting, the meeting broke down.
　　According to TASS Paris dispatch: At the meeting on the 21st, the US representative Jessup spoke first, giving a so-called "overview" of the situation at the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting, going to extremes in distortion. Despite this, Jessup could not refute the following facts: the Soviet delegation had agreed to include all the issues raised by the three-nation delegations on the agenda without exception, while the three-nation delegations placed the Soviet Union in an unequal position, opposing the Soviet proposal to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of US military bases (as unresolved issues) on the agenda.
　　British representative Davies and French representative Parrot also made similar statements.
　　Soviet representative Gromyko said that the attitude taken by the three countries' representatives towards the Soviet note of the 20th once again proves that the three governments falsely say they are willing to discuss the causes of international tension at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting, but in reality, they are hindering the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, deliberately putting forward unacceptable and absolutely unfounded demands, demanding that the main causes of tension in Europe, namely the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of US military bases, not be included in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, even as unresolved issues.
　　Gromyko pointed out that Jessup's speech was completely unfounded. According to Jessup, the Soviet delegation's insistence on its proposal prevented the work of the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting. Gromyko said that we have not prevented the work of the meeting. On the contrary, the Soviet government directly stated in its note of the 20th the necessity of continuing the work of the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting. The Soviet government has indicated that it is ready to send representatives to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Washington as soon as the Foreign Minister Assistants reach an agreement on the Soviet proposals. Whether an agreement can be reached on the agenda depends on the three Western countries. Whether the Foreign Ministers' Meeting will be convened also depends on the three Western countries. Therefore, if the three governments continue to maintain the attitude they have maintained towards the Soviet proposals, it is not difficult to understand who should be responsible for the complex nature that our meeting has encountered in its work.
　　After Gromyko's speech, Davies read a statement on behalf of the three Western delegations, saying that the three governments refused to continue the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting convened to formulate the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
　　Gromyko then made a lengthy statement, listing the various facts of the US, British, and French delegations sabotaging the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting, and pointed out that the statement of the three delegations was an action to obstruct the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The US, British, and French governments should be responsible for the emergence of this situation.
　　The Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting, which has been held for more than three months, has now come to an end due to the refusal of the US, British, and French representatives to continue the meeting.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, June 24th] According to TASS Paris, June 23rd: Gromyko, the Soviet representative attending the Four-Power Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting, made a lengthy statement at the meeting on the 21st on the US, British, and French governments sabotaging the Four-Power Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting.
　　Gromyko said that the negotiations have been held for more than three months and have still not reached an agreement. This is not because it is not easy to find important issues related to world peace, nor is it because it is not easy to formulate an agenda, but because of the policies pursued by the US, Britain, and France. Throughout the meeting, they have consistently opposed including major issues related to strengthening peace in Europe and improving relations between the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
　　Gromyko then recounted that, in view of the Western three governments' blatant violation of the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulated the elimination of German militarism, for several years, the Soviet government first proposed convening a Foreign Ministers' Meeting eight months ago to discuss the issue of fulfilling this agreement. Under pressure from public opinion, the US, British, and French governments had to agree to conduct preliminary negotiations with the Soviet Union. However, they first insisted on expanding the scope of the discussion, opposing being limited to the issue of eliminating German militarism. The Soviet government expressed its agreement. The Soviet delegation then suggested at the meeting that some issues of great importance for strengthening peace in Europe and improving relations between the four countries be included on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. However, the three Western countries ganged up to oppose the Soviet proposals, and they put forward another agenda proposal.
　　The proposals of the three Western countries avoid discussing truly important and urgent issues concerning ensuring peace in Europe and improving the international situation, or reduce the importance of these issues, and their purpose is only to confuse public opinion.
　　The Western representatives have tried their best to oppose including the issue of eliminating German militarism on the agenda. After they had to agree to include it on the agenda, they firmly opposed mentioning the wording of the Potsdam Agreement and the term "preventing the re-militarization of Germany." In order to reach an agreement, the Soviet delegation agreed to change the wording and remove the wording according to the Potsdam Agreement. The three countries' representatives then opposed discussing it as a fully agreed issue, and insisted on listing it as a minor item. As a result, the issue of the position of this item on the agenda was left unresolved and needed to be decided by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
　　The Western three countries' representatives also opposed the wording of the Soviet proposal on immediately starting to reduce the four countries' armaments and troops. They insisted that it should not be said "immediately starting," and demanded that this issue also be listed as an ancillary issue to the Western three countries' proposal on the causes of the tense international situation in Europe. The Soviet delegation agreed not to use the words "immediately starting," but the Western representatives still refused to accept it. They proposed the issue of "armament levels" to replace the issue of reducing armaments, attempting to bury the issue of reducing armaments under the pretext that their armaments were still "not at the right level." In order for the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be convened and discuss this major issue, the Soviet delegation also agreed to submit both sides' wording to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
　　Finally, the Western countries resolutely refused to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of US military bases on the agenda, even as unresolved items, and adopted a course of breaking up the meeting, which shows their true intentions.
　　Gromyko then listed many facts about the North Atlantic Group intensifying its preparations for aggressive war during the meeting, colluding with the Bonn elements to accelerate the restoration of German militarism and troops in West Germany, wooing Greece, Turkey, and even Spain, expanding the movement of troops and armaments, and establishing more aggressive military bases, etc., and cited US Senator Taft's speech to prove that the North Atlantic Treaty is a military alliance for aggressive war, a plan for the United States to use soldiers of other countries as cannon fodder for its aggression, refuting the Western countries' lies that the North Atlantic Treaty is "defensive."
　　Gromyko pointed out that the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty and US military bases is the main reason for the current tense international relations in Europe. The Western three countries' refusal to discuss this most important issue precisely shows that the three countries do not want to eliminate the tense situation in Europe, but want to maintain this tense situation to achieve aggressive purposes. They want to continue to pursue their policy of gathering military blocs against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries and use the smoke screen of negotiations to conceal their actions.
　　The Western three countries twice sent notes to the Soviet Union on May 31st and June 15th, refusing to have the Foreign Ministers' Meeting discuss the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of US military bases, and attempted to suspend the work of the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting. The Soviet Union submitted replies on June 4th and 20th, insisting on continuing the discussions of the Foreign Minister Assistants' Meeting in order to reach an agreement on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, and stated that as long as the three countries agreed to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of US military bases on the agenda as unresolved items, the Soviet Union would immediately send representatives to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting. However, the three governments continued to refuse the Soviet proposals without reason, and directly took the road of sabotaging the Assistants' Meeting, issuing a statement to stop the work of the preparatory meeting.
　　Gromyko concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation, in accordance with the decision of the Soviet government, has worked hard for more than three months to reach an agreement, and has made concessions to the three countries' delegations on many important issues. The statement of the three Western countries' delegations to stop the work of the meeting cannot but be regarded as an action to obstruct the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The US, British, and French governments should be responsible for the emergence of this situation.

　　四国外长助理会议宣告破裂
    葛罗米柯斥美英法蓄意破坏会议
    并揭露北大西洋集团加紧侵略战争准备
    【新华社二十四日讯】苏美英法四国外长助理于二十一日举行第七十四次会议，亦即最后一次会议。在这次会议上，由于美英法的代表拒绝继续举行会议，会议遂告破裂。
    据塔斯社巴黎消息：在二十一日的会议上，美国代表耶塞普首先发言，对外长助理会议上所发生的情况作了一个所谓“概述”，极尽歪曲之能事。虽然如此，耶塞普却丝毫不能驳倒下述事实：苏联代表团已同意把三国代表团所提出的一切问题都毫无例外地列入议程，而三国代表团则使苏联处于不平等的地位，反对苏联所提出的把北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题（作为未获协议的议案）列入议程的建议。
    英国代表戴维斯和法国代表巴罗第也作了类似的发言。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯说，三国代表对苏联二十日的照会所采取的态度，再一次证明：三国政府虚伪地说他们愿意在四国外长会议上讨论国际紧张局势的原因，而实际上却阻挠外长会议的召开，故意提出不能接受而且绝对没有根据的要求，要求不把欧洲紧张局势的主要原因，即关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地的问题列入外长会议的议程，即使作为未获协议的议案也不行。
    葛罗米柯指出，耶塞普的发言完全没有根据。据耶塞普说，苏联代表团既坚持其建议，因而就阻止了外长助理会议的工作。葛罗米柯说，我们没有阻止会议的工作，相反的，苏联政府在二十日的照会中还直接说明有必要继续进行外长助理会议的工作。苏联政府已经表明，一俟各外长助理就苏联建议取得协议，它准备马上就派代表出席在华盛顿举行的外长会议。能否就议程获致协议，这取决于西方三国。是否要召开外长会议，这也取决于西方三国。因此，如果三国政府继续保持它们至今仍然保持的对苏联建议的态度，那么，谁应对我们的会议在工作中已经面临的复杂性质负责，是不难了解的。
    在葛罗米柯发言之后，戴维斯代表西方三国代表团宣读了一项声明说，三国政府拒绝继续进行为了拟订外长会议议程而召开的外长助理会议。
    葛罗米柯于是发表长篇声明，历述美英法三国代表破坏外长助理会议的种种事实，并指出：三国代表团的声明，是阻挠召开外长会议的行动，这种局势的产生，应由美英法三国政府负责。
    已经举行了三个多月的外长助理会议，由于美英法代表拒绝继续召开，至此宣告结束。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：出席四国外长助理会议的苏联代表葛罗米柯，在二十一日会议上曾就美英法三国政府破坏四国外长助理会议事发表长篇声明。
    葛罗米柯说，谈判已经举行了三个多月，仍然没有获得协议，这不是因为不容易找到世界和平所系的重要问题，也不是因为不容易制定一项议程，而是美英法三国奉行的政策所致。在整个会议过程中，他们始终反对把有关加强欧洲和平及改善美英法苏四国关系的重大问题列入外长会议议程。
    葛罗米柯继而追述苏联政府鉴于西方三国政府几年来悍然破坏规定肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定，乃于八个月前首先建议召开外长会议，讨论履行这个协定的问题。美英法三国政府迫于舆论的压力，曾不得不同意与苏联进行预备谈判。但是，他们首先坚持扩大讨论的范围，反对限于肃清德国军国主义问题。苏联政府表示同意。苏联代表团于是在会上建议将一些对加强欧洲和平与改善四国关系具有巨大重要性的问题列入外长会议议程。但是，西方三国结成一气反对苏联的建议，他们提出另一议程建议。
    西方三国的建议避开讨论关于确保欧洲和平与改善国际局势的真正重要与迫切的问题，或是缩小了这些问题的重要性，其目的仅在于迷惑舆论。
    西方代表曾极力反对把肃清德国军国主义的问题列入议程。等到他们不得不同意将它列入议程之后，他们又坚决反对提到波茨坦协定的字句和“防止德国重新军国主义化”的提法。苏联代表团为求获得协议，同意改变措辞，并取消根据波茨坦协定的字样。三国代表于是又反对把它作为充分获得协议的问题来讨论，而坚持将它列为次要项目，结果，这一项目在议程中所占地位的问题遂悬而未决，需留待外长会议决定。
    西方三国代表也反对苏联关于立即开始裁减四国军备和军队的建议的措词。他们坚持不应说“立即开始”，并要求把这一问题也列为西方三国所提关于造成欧洲国际紧张局势的原因一项的附属问题。苏联代表团同意不用“立即开始”字样，但西方代表仍然拒绝接受，他们提出“军备水平”问题来代替裁减军备问题，企图在什么它们的军备还“不够水平”的借口下埋葬裁减军备问题。苏联代表团为求外长会议能以召开并讨论这一重大问题，又同意将双方的措辞都提交外长会议。
    最后，西方国家又断然拒绝把北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题甚至作为未获协议的项目列入议程，并且采取了使会议决裂的路线，这就表明了他们的真正意向。
    葛罗米柯继而列举了北大西洋集团在会议期间加紧进行侵略战争准备，勾结波恩分子在西德加速恢复德国军国主义和军队，拉拢希腊、土耳其以至西班牙，扩大军队与军备运动，建立更多的侵略军事基地等等许多事实，并引美国参议员塔夫脱的演说辞证明北大西洋公约就是侵略战争的军事联盟，是美国利用其他国家士兵充当其侵略炮灰的计划，驳斥了西方国家关于北大西洋公约是什么“防御性的”的谎话。
    葛罗米柯指出，北大西洋公约以及美国军事基地的存在正是目前欧洲国际关系紧张的主要原因，西方三国拒绝讨论这个最关紧要的问题，恰恰说明三国并不想消除欧洲的紧张局势，而是要保持这种紧张局势以达到侵略的目的。它们要继续奉行其纠合军事集团以反对苏联和人民民主国家的政策而用谈判的烟幕来遮掩他们的行动。
    西方三国曾于五月三十一日及六月十五日两次照会苏联，拒绝由外长会议讨论北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题，并企图中止外长助理会议的工作。苏联于六月四日及二十日先后提出复文，坚持继续外长助理会议的讨论，以便就外长会议议程获得协议，并表示只要三国同意将北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题作为未获协议的项目列入议程，苏联就将立即派代表出席四国外长会议。但是，三国政府继续毫无理由地拒绝苏联的建议，并直接走上破坏助理会议的道路，发表了停止预备会议工作的声明。
    葛罗米柯最后说：苏联代表团遵照苏联政府的决定，三个多月来为获得协议而努力，在许多重要问题上曾经迁就了三国代表团。三个西方国家代表团发表停止会议工作的声明，不能不认为是阻挠召开外长会议的行动。这种局势的产生，应由美英法三国政府负责。
