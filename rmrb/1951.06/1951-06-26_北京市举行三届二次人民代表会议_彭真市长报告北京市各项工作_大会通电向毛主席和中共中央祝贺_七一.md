[Report from Our Newspaper] The Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress held its second meeting on the 23rd and 24th of this month.

　　At the meeting on the 23rd, Mayor Peng Zhen reported on the various tasks of Beijing, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the city's financial revenue and expenditure for the year, concurrently Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Luo Ruiqing reported on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, Deputy Mayor Wu Han and Secretary-General Xue Zizheng reported on cultural, educational, health, and municipal construction work. Secretary-General Xue also explained the current progress of municipal construction projects in his report. In his report on the various tasks in Beijing over the past three months, Mayor Peng Zhen stated that through patriotic education in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, Beijing has greatly eliminated the influence of imperialism, dealt a heavy blow to the remaining imperialist forces; enhanced the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the people; and further strengthened the unity of people from all walks of life. Currently, people from all walks of life are enthusiastically responding to the three major appeals of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and launching a patriotic donation campaign. At the same time, vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries has given vent to the grievances of the people, redressed injustices, given an effective suppression to the remaining counter-revolutionaries, and further consolidated the revolutionary order. In terms of political power construction, elections for the People's Government Committees of districts and villages have been carried out. Some village cadres were voted out of office due to their poor work style, sluggish work, unfair handling of affairs, and even corruption, which serves as an education for our cadres and promotes the construction of democratic political power and various tasks. In the next two or three months, all district and village governments will conduct similar elections. Security committees should be organized in factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhoods. All government units must earnestly and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism to overcome complacency and shortcomings in their work. Subsequently, Mayor Peng Zhen reported on the progress of municipal construction and other work in the past six months.

　　Representatives from all walks of life unanimously praised the achievements of Beijing's various tasks, while also criticizing the shortcomings that still exist in the work of some departments. During the discussion at the meeting on the 24th, thirty-three representatives spoke, all of whom believed that the popular and in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea movement had raised the awareness of the broad masses of the people and promoted production and construction. Many representatives from factories and mines reported in their speeches on their over-fulfillment of production tasks. After the Pan Yudao team and the Duan Liben team of the Mentougou Chengzi Village Coal Mine successively created new records of 6.912 tons and 7.392 tons per worker in mid-June, the Xie Fulong team created a new record of 8.592 tons on the 22nd. The employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also presented this conference with achievements of increasing daily output by 10% to 14%. These achievements in patriotic production competition immediately received enthusiastic applause from all the representatives. Vendors and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors also pledged to pay taxes on time and supervise each other to eliminate illegal activities such as tax evasion. The representatives expressed their determination to do a good job in increasing production and donations, implementing patriotic conventions, and providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, so as to accelerate the final victory in the just war to resist America. The representatives believed that Beijing's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries has achieved great success: thoroughly defeating the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries, satisfying the demands of the people, consolidating the revolutionary order in the capital, and thus ensuring the smooth progress of production and construction. Everyone expressed that they would also follow Mayor Peng Zhen's instructions to organize security committees in all units and streets in the city to assist the People's Government in suppressing hidden counter-revolutionary elements. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously agreed that in terms of municipal construction, the government has implemented the principle of serving production and serving the working people. However, some tasks have suffered from insufficient planning and a careless style of work in the projects, such as roads being torn up and rebuilt after being repaired, wasting a lot of manpower and financial resources. The representatives believed that although public and private forces have now been organized to repair and construct houses on a large scale, they are still far from meeting the actual requirements. Especially in factories, although some workers' dormitories have been built, the number is small and the standards are relatively high. Therefore, it is suggested that under the current financial difficulties, the government should strive to spend less money and build more houses in sparsely populated areas. Although the housing standards are lower, this can quickly solve the housing difficulties of some citizens. Secondly, there is a serious lack of medical equipment, and the government should also supplement it within its capabilities.

　　During the meeting, the farmer representatives wrote a letter asking the chairman of the conference to read it to the students, expressing their gratitude for the help given to the farmers by the students in the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Especially in the recent work of fighting locusts, the students, under the call of the government, mobilized six to seven thousand students to help catch and kill locusts, so that the agricultural production in the suburbs suffered less damage.

　　Representatives from all walks of life, Zhou Ruiming, Tian Zhugang, and others, proposed to the conference that in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, a telegram should be sent to Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee in the name of the conference. This proposal immediately received a long and enthusiastic applause from all the representatives, and was unanimously passed by standing up.

　　The meeting received a total of 185 proposals, and the conference decided to hand them over to the Consultative Committee for processing.

　　Finally, Chairman Peng Zhen summarized the speeches of the meeting, and all the representatives unanimously passed the resolution on the government work report.

　　北京市举行三届二次人民代表会议
    彭真市长报告北京市各项工作
    大会通电向毛主席和中共中央祝贺“七一”
    【本报讯】北京市第三届各界人民代表会议在本月二十三、二十四日举行第二次会议。
    二十三日开会时，由彭真市长报告北京市各项工作，张友渔副市长报告今年度财政收支情况，市公安局罗瑞卿兼局长报告镇压反革命的工作，吴晗副市长和薛子正秘书长报告文教卫生和市政建设工作，薛秘书长在报告中并说明了现在市政建设工程完成的情况。彭真市长在报告北京市最近三个多月来的各项工作情况时，他说明：北京市在抗美援朝运动中，经过爱国主义的教育，大大扫除了帝国主义的影响，给了帝国主义残余势力很大打击；提高了人民群众的政治觉悟和爱国热忱；进一步加强了各阶层人民的团结。目前各界人民正在热烈响应抗美援朝总会三大号召，展开爱国捐献运动。同时，大张旗鼓镇压反革命，给老百姓出了气，申了冤，给了反革命残余以有效的镇压，进一步巩固了革命秩序。在政权建设方面，进行了区、村人民政府委员会的选举。若干村干部因为作风不好、工作疲塌、办事不公，甚至贪污腐化而落选，这对我们的干部是一个教育，使民主政权建设和各项工作向前推进了一步。在今后两三个月内，所有区村政权都要进行同样的选举。各工厂、机关、学校、街道要组织治安保卫委员会。政府各单位要切实、经常开展批评与自我批评，克服居功自满的情绪和工作中的缺点。接着，彭真市长报告了半年来市政建设等工作进行的情况。
    各界代表一致赞扬京市各项工作的成就，同时批评了某些部门工作中还存在着的缺点。二十四日大会讨论时，三十三个代表发言，都认为普及和深入的抗美援朝运动，提高了广大人民的觉悟，推动了生产建设。许多工矿代表在发言中报告他们超额完成生产任务的情况。门头沟城子村煤矿在六月中旬潘玉道班、段立本班先后创造每工六·九一二吨和七·三九二吨新纪录后，谢甫龙班在二十二日又创造了八·五九二吨的新纪录。石景山钢铁厂的职工们，还用提高日产量百分之十到十四的成绩，向这次大会献礼。这些爱国生产竞赛的成绩，立刻得到全体代表的热烈鼓掌欢迎。摊贩和工商界代表也保证按时纳税，并相互监督，消灭偷税、漏税等不法行为。代表们表示一定要做好增产捐献，实行爱国公约和优待烈属、军属的工作，加速争取抗美正义战争的最后胜利。代表们认为北京市大张旗鼓镇压反革命工作有很大的成绩：彻底打下反革命的气焰，满足人民的要求，巩固首都的革命秩序，进而保障了生产建设顺利进行。大家表示还要依照彭真市长的指示，在全市各单位和街道中，组织治安保卫委员会，协助人民政府，镇压隐藏的反革命分子。代表们在发言中，一致认为在市政建设方面，政府是执行了为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针，但是，若干工作因为计划性不够和工程中存在着粗枝大叶的作风，如道路修好了又拆掉重修，浪费许多人力和财力。代表们认为现在虽然组织了公私力量，大批修缮和建筑房屋，但是，还远不能满足实际的要求，尤其在工厂中虽然盖了一些工房，但为数既少，而标准又较高。因此建议政府在目前财政困难的条件下，应该在居民较稀的地区，争取少花一些钱，多建一些房屋，这样虽然房屋标准较低，但能很快争取解决一部分市民住房的困难。其次是医疗设备甚感缺乏，政府也应该在可能范围内加以补充。
    在会议进行中，农民代表写了一封信，请大会主席向学生们宣读，表示他们对于学生在土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝运动中给予农民们的帮助的感谢。尤其是最近扑灭蝗虫的工作，同学们在政府的号召下，发动了六、七千同学前往帮助捕打蝗虫，使郊区的农业生产少受损失。
    各界代表周瑞明、田竹岗等十人，向大会提出为庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年，以大会名义，电毛主席和中共中央致贺。这个提案立即得到全体代表长时间的热烈鼓掌，并一致起立通过。
    会议共收到提案一百八十五件，大会决定交由协商委员会处理。
    最后由彭真主席总结会议的发言，全体代表并一致通过关于政府工作报告的决议。
