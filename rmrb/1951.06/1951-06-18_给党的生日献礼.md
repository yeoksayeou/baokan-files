            Hongjing Branch of the Communist Party of China in Licheng, Shanxi, Does Well in Wheat Harvesting and Seedling Weeding, Deeply Involved in Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    The Hongjing Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, held a党员大会 (Party Member Congress) on May 30th, summarizing the spring plowing and sowing work, and formulating a plan to welcome "July 1st." All party members of the branch are determined to celebrate the Party's birthday by taking the lead in guiding the masses to do a good job in wheat harvesting and seedling weeding, as well as strengthening the study of current affairs, politics, and culture. In order to complete the above plan, party members have pledged to continue to deepen the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, and further combine the masses' patriotic enthusiasm against American imperialism with the summer production competition movement. Party members have all selected propaganda targets, and before "July 1st," each party member will publicize the message to the masses twenty times. In addition, the branch has decided to lead the propaganda network well, with each propagandist publicizing the message to the masses twenty-five times. The blackboard bulletin will be changed every three days, and the rooftop broadcast will be done every two days. Through these activities, the masses' enthusiasm for patriotic production competition will continue to be consolidated and promoted.
            The Wu'xiang Second District Party Committee Leads Rural Branches to Carry Out Patriotic Production and Implement Patriotic Pledges
    The Second District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in Wu'xiang County, Shanxi Province, and the Yaoshanggou Village Branch have both formulated plans to celebrate the Party's birthday based on local conditions. In late May, the Wu'xiang Second District Party Committee led all thirty-three rural branches in the district to formulate a June plan for patriotic production competition to resist America and aid Korea, with the practical achievements of realizing this plan as a gift to celebrate the Party's birthday. The plan emphasizes: 1. Combine with practical work to deepen the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea. In June, conduct a general inspection of the implementation of patriotic pledges inside and outside the Party, and at the same time organize the masses to revise and enrich the content of the patriotic pledges. 2. Universally carry out propaganda for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, striving to ensure that everyone understands the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." 3. Continue to lead the masses to turn to the summer patriotic production competition. In June, conduct a general inspection of the work of cultivation on behalf of others, and at the same time elect model villages and model individuals for cultivation on behalf of others in the district, and each village must earnestly do a good job in providing preferential treatment. The Yaoshanggou Branch's plan to welcome "July 1st" also proposes: To earnestly implement and inspect the village's patriotic pledges.
