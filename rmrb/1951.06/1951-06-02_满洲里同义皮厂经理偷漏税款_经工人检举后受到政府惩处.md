To the Editor:

　　Manzhouli City private Tongyi Tannery manager Lü Xuewen repeatedly evaded taxes, and was penalized after being reported by worker Hao Jing. When the factory opened, it had 800 sheepskins as equity in kind. Lü Xuewen underreported 78 and a half sheepskins and recorded these 78 and a half sheepskins on the purchase ledger. Last year, he sold two jin of dye, and the proceeds of 2.4 million yuan were not recorded. At the end of the year, when taking inventory, he recorded 200 winter sheepskins as board skins, concealing 132,000 yuan per skin, for a total concealed value of 26.4 million yuan. Throughout the year, over 6.33 million yuan was added to the purchase ledger. Regarding this, worker Hao Jing took the initiative to offer his opinion, but Lü Xuewen not only did not listen but also said, "You do your job; if something happens, it's my responsibility and has nothing to do with you." He also said, "Cats don't eat vegetarian food." Because Hao Jing could not tolerate his behavior of undermining national tax revenue and violating patriotic pledges, he reported it to the Manzhouli City People's Government Tax Bureau. After investigation and confirmation by the Tax Bureau, the factory has been fined four times the amount of tax owed, totaling 66,769,000 yuan.

　　满洲里同义皮厂经理偷漏税款
    经工人检举后受到政府惩处编辑同志：
    满洲里市私营同义制皮厂经理吕学文，一再偷漏应纳税款，经工人郝靖检举后受到惩处。该厂开业时共有八百张羊皮的实物股，吕学文少报了七十八张半，并把这七十八张半羊皮写在买货账上；去年他卖了二斤颜料，卖款二百四十万元没上账；年底点货时，他把二百张冬羊皮点作板皮，每张瞒价十三万二千元，共瞒价二千六百四十万元。全年共在买货账上多出了六百三十三万余元。对此，该厂工人郝靖曾主动提出意见，吕学文不但不听，反而说：“你做你的活，出了事是我的，对你没关系。”并说：“猫没有吃素的。”郝靖因为不能容忍他这种破坏国家税收与违背爱国公约的行为，便报告了满洲里市人民政府税务局。经税局调查确实后，已予该厂以应纳税款四倍罚金的处分，共罚款六千六百七十六万九千元。
