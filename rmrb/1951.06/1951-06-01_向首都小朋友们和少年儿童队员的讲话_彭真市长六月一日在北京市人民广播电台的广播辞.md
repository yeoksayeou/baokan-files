Children and Young Pioneers of the whole city:

　　Today is International Children's Day, a holiday for you children. I congratulate you and wish you a happy participation in the various activities of Children's Day.

　　Children! Today's China is the China led by Chairman Mao, a China where the revolution has triumphed, a China where the people have become masters. Children are the little masters of the new China. Children of the Mao Zedong era are happy and glorious. I wish you happiness. Our motherland is great and lovely, we must love our motherland.

　　I hope you all study hard, and each of you will become a youth and child with knowledge, learning, ability to handle affairs, and creative ability, so that you can serve the people and the motherland well.

　　I hope you will all exercise well, sleep when you should sleep, eat and drink when you should eat and drink, study hard when you should be in class, and play hard when you should be playing. Everyone should pay attention to hygiene and build your bodies strong, so that you can serve the people and the motherland well.

　　Labor is glorious, and it is shameful to be lazy and parasitic. I hope that every child will love labor and develop a habit of loving labor, so as to do things for the people.

　　Our public property is the property of the people, and we must cherish public property. I hope that every child will become a model of cherishing public property.

　　Imperialism is our enemy, the landlord class is our enemy, and all counter-revolutionaries are our enemies. They oppose our motherland, undermine our construction, and destroy our happiness. We must oppose them and eliminate them. Only in this way can we protect our happiness and our country. Children! In order to defend our motherland, defend our families, and defend our happiness, our Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting the invading troops of imperialism, and our Chinese People's Liberation Army and public security armed forces are defending our country in every way. We must continue to carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea, support the front lines, love and support them.

　　Children, I have spoken for too long. Finally, I wish you a happy holiday. I wish each of you to become a knowledgeable, capable, and creative little master of the new China. All our happiness now has been achieved through resolute struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We should thank Chairman Mao. Let us shout:

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
