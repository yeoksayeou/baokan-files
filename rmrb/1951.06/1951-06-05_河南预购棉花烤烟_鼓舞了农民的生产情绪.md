　　Henan Pre-Purchases Cotton and Flue-Cured Tobacco, Encouraging Farmers' Production Enthusiasm
　　The Henan Provincial People's Government and state-owned trading companies are pre-purchasing cotton and flue-cured tobacco from farmers. The Henan Provincial State-Owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company signed contracts with the Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau and the State-Owned Grain Company in late March and early April, allocating more than 50 million jin of wheat, millet, corn and other grains to provide interest-free loans to cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas such as Shanzhou, Luoyang, Shangqiu, Chenliu, and Nanyang, starting in April, for pre-purchasing more than 320,000 dan of cotton. These grains are distributed by local People's Governments according to the principle of "more loans for more cotton planting, fewer loans for less cotton planting, and no loans for no cotton planting," organizing cotton farmers to collect them from nearby grain companies or grain bureaus, taking the township or grassroots cooperative as the unit. By mid-May, the cotton pre-purchase work in Shanzhou and Luoyang Special Districts, the main cotton-producing areas in Henan, had basically completed the plan, and Shangqiu and Chenliu Special Districts had also completed more than 70% of the plan.
　　In order to pre-purchase flue-cured tobacco from tobacco farmers in Xuchang Special District, a famous flue-cured tobacco producing area, the Henan Provincial State-Owned Tobacco Company signed contracts with the State-Owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company, Grain Company, and the People's Government Grain Bureau, stipulating that before the end of May, 75,000 tons of coal for tobacco curing and more than 10 million jin of various grains would be supplied to tobacco farmers. In order to lend coal for tobacco curing in a timely manner, the People's Governments at the county, district, and township levels in Xuchang, Changge, Lin颍, Xiangcheng, Ye County, and Wuyang established coal loan committees to organize the transportation and distribution of coal for tobacco curing.
　　The People's Governments at all levels in Henan lend grain and coal to cotton and tobacco farmers for pre-purchasing cotton and tobacco according to the cotton-grain and tobacco-grain parity ratios stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, solving some of the difficulties in production materials and living materials for cotton and tobacco farmers, thus encouraging their production enthusiasm. Many counties in cotton-producing areas have overfulfilled the cotton planting plan. Farmers in Shan County, the main cotton-producing area in Henan, have converted many melon fields to cotton planting, and the county's cotton planting area has increased by 36.36% compared with last year. The tobacco planting area in Xuchang Special District, the main tobacco-producing area in Henan, has also exceeded the original plan by 16.67%.

　　河南预购棉花烤烟
    鼓舞了农民的生产情绪
    河南省人民政府和国营贸易公司向农民预购棉花、烤烟。河南省国营花纱布公司在三月底和四月初就分别和省人民政府粮食局、国营粮食公司订立合同，调拨小麦、小米、玉米等粮食五千多万斤，从四月份起，在陕州、洛阳、商邱、陈留、南阳等棉产区无息贷给棉农，预购棉花三十二万多担。这些粮食由各地人民政府根据“种棉多多贷、种棉少少贷、不种棉不贷”的原则，以乡或基层合作社为单位，组织棉农到就近粮食公司或粮食局领取。到五月中旬止，河南主要棉产区陕州、洛阳专区各县棉花预购工作基本上已经完成计划，商邱、陈留专区也已完成计划的百分之七十以上。
    为了向著名烤烟产区许昌专区各县烟农预购烤烟，河南省公营烟草公司和国营煤业建筑材料公司、粮食公司、人民政府粮食局订立合同，规定在五月底以前供应烟农烤烟用煤七万五千吨，各种粮食一千多万斤。为了及时贷出烤烟用煤，许昌、长葛、临颍、襄城、叶县、舞阳等县和各该县的区、乡各级人民政府都建立了煤贷委员会，有组织地运输和分配烤烟用煤。
    河南各地人民政府按政务院财政经济委员会规定的棉粮、烟粮比价向棉农、烟农贷放粮、煤，预购棉花、烟草，解决了棉农、烟农一部分生产资料和生活资料的困难，因而鼓舞了他们的生产情绪。棉产区很多县都已超额完成植棉计划。河南主要棉产区陕县农民把很多瓜田改种棉花，该县植棉面积已比去年扩大百分之三十六点三六，河南主要烟产区许昌专区的植烟面积也比原定计划超过百分之十六点六七。
