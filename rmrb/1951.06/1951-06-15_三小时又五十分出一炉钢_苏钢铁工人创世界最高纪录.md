Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th Dispatch from TASS: Soviet steelworkers have achieved great success in adopting rapid steelmaking methods. Solovyov, a young steelworker at the Isiyevsky Metallurgical Plant, set the world's highest record in metallurgy. On May 22nd, he produced a furnace of steel in three hours and fifty minutes, shortening the standard time by about half and saving more than five tons of fuel. The steel production record reached 15.7 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom.

　　Advanced teams at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works had already completed their June production plans by the end of May. Since the beginning of this year, some teams have produced 215 furnaces of steel using accelerated steelmaking methods. At the New Tagil Metallurgical Plant, three rapid steelmakers alone exceeded the May plan by more than 1,000 tons of steel. Half of the steel produced by Pelevisev, a famous young worker at the Azov Steel Plant in Zhdanov, this year was made using accelerated steelmaking methods, and he has increased the production of steel for the great communist construction projects by 600 tons. The furnace operator of a Martin furnace at the Makiivka factory, due to the adoption of accelerated iron casting methods, has reduced the loss of metal in the pouring machine by half and saved more than 1.5 million rubles beyond the plan.

　　三小时又五十分出一炉钢        
    苏钢铁工人创世界最高纪录
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联钢铁工人采用快速炼钢的方法已获得巨大成就。伊席夫斯凯冶金厂的青年炼钢工人索洛维耶夫创造了世界冶金术的最高纪录，他在五月二十二日以三小时五十分的时间炼出一炉钢，比标准时间约缩短了一半，并且节省了五吨多燃料。钢产量的纪录达到每一平方公尺炉底出钢十五点七吨。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克炼钢厂各先进小组在五月下旬就已完成了六月份的生产计划。从今年年初以来，有些小组已用加速炼钢法炼出二百一十五炉钢。在新塔吉尔冶金厂，单是三个快速炼钢工人就已超过五月份计划多生产了一千多吨钢。日丹诺夫城亚速钢铁厂的著名青年工人培累维塞夫今年炼的钢有一半是用加速炼钢法炼的，他已经给伟大的共产主义建设工程增产了六百吨钢。马基耶夫工厂一座马丁炉的司炉由于采用了加速铣铁铸造法，已使灌铸机中的金属损耗减少了一半，并超计划节省了一百五十多万卢布。
