The Henan Provincial People's Government and CPC Henan Provincial Committee Issue Instructions to Carry Out Cotton Purchase and Storage Work
[Our newspaper Kaifeng 4th, 22:00 dispatch] In order to implement the State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on cotton purchase and storage work, the Henan Provincial People's Government and the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on the 4th to all levels of government, all enterprise departments, and all levels of Party committees throughout the province. The Henan Provincial People's Government's instructions stated in brief: Thanks to the People's Government's vigorous policies of rewarding and supporting cotton production, the province's cotton acreage this year has exceeded the original planned acreage. However, at the current time when old and new cotton crops are in a transitional period, cotton farmers in various localities are reluctant to sell their stored cotton. According to investigations, in Huaiyang Prefecture's Taikang County, middle and poor peasants currently have about one-third of last year's cotton harvest in storage. According to a survey of nine typical households in Shiyuanji and Yinzhuang in Qi County, Chenliu Prefecture, the cotton in storage accounts for about 30% of last year's harvest. In Xuchang Prefecture, the cotton in storage generally accounts for 20% of last year's harvest. Therefore, it is necessary to advise farmers to actively sell their stored cotton to the state as an expression of their patriotism. The instructions require: (1) People's governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas, cotton, yarn and cloth branch companies, trade branch companies, People's Banks, cooperatives, etc., should immediately convene meetings of farmer representatives, cotton farmer representatives, or various forums to persuade farmers to sell their stored cotton to the state to support the needs of the textile industry; (2) Cotton, yarn and cloth branch companies, trade companies, cooperatives, etc., should conduct purchases according to the cotton prices determined by the central government and ensure the cotton-grain price parity policy; (3) Cooperatives and People's Bank branches and sub-branches should actively absorb cotton farmers' in-kind savings or price-indexed savings through savings methods that are beneficial to farmers; trade companies, cotton, yarn and cloth companies, and cooperatives intend to carry out purchases on credit from cotton farmers, giving them preferential treatment in terms of price. The instructions of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party point out that local Party committees should list the cotton purchase and storage work as a major task at present. Party committees at all levels throughout the province should actively mobilize all Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cooperative members to take practical actions to lead the vast number of cotton farmers to launch a patriotic cotton sales and storage movement.

　　河南省人民政府及中共河南省委会指示
    进行购棉储棉工作
    【本报开封四日二十二时专电】为了执行中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示，河南省人民政府与中国共产党河南省委员会，于四日分别向全省各级政府，各企业部门，各级党委发出指示。河南省人民政府的指示略谓：由于人民政府对棉花生产采取了有力的奖励扶植政策，今年全省棉田面积已超过原计划的亩数。但在目前新旧棉花青黄不接时期，各地棉农有存棉不肯出售的现象。据调查，淮阳专区的太康县棉农中的中农和贫农，现存棉花约占去年收棉的三分之一。据陈留专区杞县柿园集、尹庄九个典型户调查，存棉约占去年收棉量的百分之三十。许昌专区各地一般存棉占去年收棉的百分之二十。为此，必须劝告农民积极将存棉卖给国家，作为农民对国家的爱国表示。该指示要求：（一）产棉区各级人民政府、花纱布分公司、贸易分公司、人民银行、合作社等，应立即召开农民代表会议、棉农代表会议或各种座谈会，劝导农民将存棉售与国家，支持纺织工业的需要；（二）花纱布分公司、贸易公司、合作社等，应根据中央确定的棉花价格，举行收购，并确保棉粮比价政策；（三）合作社、人民银行分、支行，以对农民有利的储蓄办法，积极吸收棉农实物储蓄或折实储蓄；贸易公司、花纱布公司、合作社拟向棉农进行赊购，从价钱上给棉农以优待。中国共产党河南省委员会的指示中指出：各地党委应将购棉储棉工作列为目前一项重大任务。全省各级党委应积极动员全体党员、青年团员、合作社员以实际行动，带动广大棉农，展开爱国售棉储棉运动。
