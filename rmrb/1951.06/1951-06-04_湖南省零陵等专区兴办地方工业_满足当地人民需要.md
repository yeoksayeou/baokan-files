Hunan Province's Lingling and Other Regions
Establish Local Industries
To Meet Local People's Needs

    In order to meet the needs of the local people, the Lingling, Yiyang, and Changde Special Commissioner's Offices and the Hengyang Municipal People's Government of Hunan Province have been establishing a number of local industries in small and medium-sized towns in a planned way, using local funds and absorbing private capital. Since last year, the Lingling Special Commissioner's Office has opened 23 small factories for sawing wood, pressing oil, weaving cloth, milling rice, and generating electricity. The Yiyang Special Commissioner's Office has opened power plants, smelting plants, rice mills, knitting factories, timber factories, and several mines. The Changde Special Commissioner's Office has opened a textile factory and a power plant. Hengyang City has established a relatively large-scale machine manufacturing factory. The main raw materials used by these factories, such as wood, peanuts, rice, cotton, coal, and iron, are all produced locally. Many of the machines they use are converted from old machines, and most of the factory buildings are public houses and large temples, so the production cost is lower and the price is cheaper, which is very popular among the local people, and some are transported to other places for sale.
    The establishment of these local industries has expanded the sales channels for agricultural products, enabled farmers to obtain the necessary industrial products, and provided employment opportunities for more than 20,000 people. Lingling County, which had been suffering from the inability to sell agricultural products for many years, has broken all previous records in the sales volume of wood, grain and other products this year. The once-quiet market, which was only open during the day, is now crowded with people trading all day long. After selling their agricultural products, farmers can immediately buy locally produced cheap fabrics, towels, socks, and a large number of farm tools and fertilizers. The establishment of these local industries has brought prosperity to the market, which in turn has stimulated the development of local industry and commerce. The number of industrial and commercial households in Lingling County has increased from more than 1,200 to more than 1,900 in the past year.

　　湖南省零陵等专区
    兴办地方工业
    满足当地人民需要
    湖南省零陵、益阳、常德各专署和衡阳市人民政府为了满足当地人民需要，有计划地运用地方资金，并吸收私人资金，在中小城镇中兴办了若干地方工业。自去年以来，零陵专署开设了锯木、榨油、织布、碾米、发电等二十三个小型工厂。益阳专署开设了电厂、冶炼、机米、针织、木材等工厂和若干矿场。常德专署开了纺织厂和发电厂。衡阳市就办了一个较大规模的机器制造厂。这些工厂所用主要原料如木材、花生、大米、棉花和煤、铁等都是当地出产。它们所用的机器有许多是旧机器改装的，厂房大部是公房和大庙，所以产品成本较低，价格也便宜，很受当地人民欢迎，并有一部运往外地销售。
    这些地方工业的兴办，为农产品扩大了销路，使农民得到了必需的工业品，并使两万多人得到就业机会。很多年来苦于农产品无法销售的零陵县，今年木材、粮食等产品的销售量都打破了历年纪录，以前日中为市的清淡市场上现在整天都挤满了进行交易的人们。农民卖出农产品以后，马上又可以买到本地出产的价廉的布匹、手巾、袜子，和大量的农具、肥料等。这些地方工业的兴办，给市场带来繁荣，因而又刺激了当地工商业的发展。零陵县工商业户数一年来已由一千二百余户增加到一千九百余户。
