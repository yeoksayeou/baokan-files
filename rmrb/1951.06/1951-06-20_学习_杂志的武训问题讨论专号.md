　　“Learning” Magazine's Special Issue on the Wu Xun Problem

　　The fourth volume, fifth issue of "Learning" (published June 16th), with the exception of Ai Siqi’s summary of the discussion on overcoming the mentality of meritorious officials in the magazine, is entirely composed of discussion articles related to the Wu Xun problem, making it a special issue.

　　The three essays by Yang Er, He Qifang, and Zhou Wen all grasped substantial and rich materials, and conducted thorough discussions on Wu Xun the person, the movie *The Life of Wu Xun*, and related commentaries. Yang Er's article is titled "Critique of Wu Xun and Propaganda About Wu Xun," and He Qifang's article is titled "Refuting the Various Eulogies of Wu Xun and *The Life of Wu Xun*." Both articles targeted the first wave of eulogies that appeared after the release of *The Life of Wu Xun*, providing in-depth analysis and criticism. Furthermore, they elevated the issues involved to the ideological principles of Marxism for explanation. Yang Er pointed out that the eulogizers of Wu Xun utilized various Marxist phrases to promote non-proletarian, even reactionary, ideas. This is an enemy that Marxism must constantly be vigilant against in its development, because "cutting off the revolutionary spirit of Marxism, vulgarizing it, or turning it into 'revisionism' suitable for the interests of the non-proletariat is a trick that is often seen."

　　He Qifang's article specifically mentioned Wu Xun's social status as a vagrant. Pointing this out is very necessary for analyzing Wu Xun's "cause." In criticizing Mr. Tao Xingzhi's weaknesses, the article pointed out the fundamental differences between Mr. Tao and Wu Xun. Explaining this point is also very necessary.

　　Zhou Wen's article discussed the two issues of Wu Xun's "asceticism" and "establishing schools." Marxism, on the one hand, opposes the empty dream of seeking people's liberation through "popularizing education," and on the other hand, analyzes various educational endeavors under reactionary rule instead of dismissing them wholesale. This point has been well explained in Zhou Wen's article.

　　This issue of "Learning" also includes eleven "Informal Talks on Wu Xun and the Film *The Life of Wu Xun*," written mostly by professors from various universities in Beijing. Although each is short, they all express their own understanding of this discussion from a certain perspective. Some of the authors conducted self-criticism in connection with this issue. In his article, Feng Youlan said: "Wu Xun in history and in the film is like a mirror. In this mirror, I saw myself. Because of my own situation, I better understand why Wu Xun is not worthy of emulation." There are still some people who say that even under reactionary education, revolutionaries can be produced, which shows that as long as education is conducted, it is helpful to the revolution. Feng Youlan's article gave a sharp answer to this sophistry, saying: "In fact, it is not because they received our education that they can serve the revolution, but rather that although they received our education, they can still serve the revolution."

### “学习”杂志的武训问题讨论专号

　　“学习”杂志的武训问题讨论专号
    “学习”四卷五期（六月十六日出版）除了一篇艾思奇关于该刊上克服功臣思想问题的讨论的总结外，全部都是有关武训的问题的讨论文字，可说是个专号。
    杨耳、何其芳、周文的三篇论文都掌握了相当丰富的材料，对于武训这个人，《武训传》这个电影和有关的各种评论，作了周密的讨论。杨耳的文章的题目是《评武训和关于武训的宣传》，何其芳的文章的题目是《驳对于武训和〈武训传〉的种种歌颂》。这两篇文章都针对在武训传电影上演后第一批出现的歌颂作了深入的分析和批判。并且把所涉及的问题提高到马克思主义的思想原则上做了说明。杨耳指出，武训的歌颂者利用马克思主义的各种词句，宣传非无产阶级的，甚至反动的思想，这本是马克思主义在发展中经常要警惕的敌人，因为“割掉马克思主义的革命精神，把它庸俗化，或者把它变成适合于非无产阶级的利益的‘修正主义’，这套把戏原是屡见不鲜的现象”。
    何其芳的文章中特别提到武训作为游民的社会地位。指出这点，来进行关于武训的“事业”的分析，是很必要的。这篇文章中，在批评陶行知先生的弱点时，指出了在陶先生和武训之间的原则的区别。说明这点也是很必要的。
    周文的文章讨论了武训的“苦行”和“兴学”这两个问题。马克思主义一方面反对那种以“普及教育”来求人民解放的空想，一方面是有分析地看待在反动统治下的各种教育工作，而不是一概抹煞。关于这点，在周文的文章中已有了很好的说明。
    这一期《学习》中还有“关于武训和电影《武训传》的笔谈”十一篇，执笔者大部分是北京各大学教授。虽然篇幅都很短，但都从一定的角度说出了自己在这个讨论中的体会。其中有一部分作者结合这个问题作了自我批评。冯友兰的文章中说：“历史上及电影中的武训好比是一面镜子，在这面镜子里，我看见了我自己，也因为我自己的情形，我更了解为什么武训不足为训”。现在还有些人说，纵然在反动的教育下也可以产生革命者，可见只要办教育就是有助于革命的。对于这种诡辩，冯友兰的文章作了尖锐的答复，他说：“其实，并不是因为他们受了我们的教育，所以他们才能为革命服务，而是，虽然他们受了我们的教育，但是他们还能为革命服务。”
