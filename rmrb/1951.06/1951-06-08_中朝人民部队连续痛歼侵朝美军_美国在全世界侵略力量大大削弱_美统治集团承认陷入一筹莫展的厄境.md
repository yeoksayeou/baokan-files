Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: As a result of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces inflicting heavy losses on the American invading army on the Korean battlefield, the aggressive strength of American imperialism worldwide has been greatly weakened. Important figures in the American ruling clique have felt serious panic about this. They have increasingly frequently lamented the weakening of American imperialism's so-called "global strategic position."

According to the American imperialist Associated Press: Washington officials stated on June 1st that the American government had instructed its representative to the United Nations, Austin, to notify United Nations Secretary-General Lie that because "all of America's available military forces are now tied down in Korea and Western Europe," it could not currently provide any troops for the planned United Nations "collective security force." It is known that the plan to establish a so-called United Nations "collective security force" was originally passed by the United Nations voting machine last autumn at the personal request of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, but now the United States has expressed such a lack of power. The Telecommunications Agency pointed out in its commentary on this event: This is, in fact, "an open admission of the weakness of the American military force," and it proves that "the essence of the 'powerful' American military machine has been destroyed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

It is precisely this situation that makes American imperialist elements unable to restrain the expression of their worries and fears.

Taft, the Republican Senate leader who has always fiercely advocated military aggression in Asia, stated on the 19th of last month that although he was initially "not very dissatisfied" with Truman's dispatch of troops to invade Korea, he now believes that it "has proven to be a mistake." He said that the war in Korea is "a failure" and "the cost of this war will greatly exceed the benefits we may gain."

The most arrogant warmonger, MacArthur, now also admits that it is impossible for the United States to achieve victory in Korea, and can only subject itself to continuous and miserable attrition. Democratic Congressman Kennedy of Massachusetts quoted MacArthur as saying to him on the 29th of last month: "We have not inflicted fatal damage on them (referring to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces), but we ourselves are suffering significant losses. More and more American blood is being shed."

Although responsible officials of the American government have so far attempted to conceal their serious failures, recent remarks by Dulles, a senior advisor to the State Department, blatantly reflect the distress of the American ruling clique. This important decision-maker in American foreign policy reluctantly admitted in a speech to students at the University of Arizona on May 29th that the continuous failures of the United States in the war of aggression against Korea "contain three dangers" for American imperialism. The first is the continuous increase in the strength of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. The second is the greater development of the extensive armed struggles of the people of many countries in Europe and Asia to defend and strive for national independence and liberation. Here, Dulles cited the anti-imperialist national liberation wars of the people of Greece, Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines. The third is the increasing rise of the people's democratic movement within all capitalist countries, which Dulles himself called "the political war against the governments of all free countries." Dulles admitted that facing these situations, the United States has fallen into a serious predicament. He said: "The United States has greatly expanded its obligations to foreign countries. With the expansion of obligations, the activities of rearmament have also intensified, which has caused inflation." Dulles added with infinite emotion: "The United States suffers an average of 100,000 casualties a year in Korea (according to General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the losses of the American invading army in Korea have long exceeded 140,000), while France and Britain respectively bear the heavy burden of the wars in Vietnam and Malaya." Therefore, Dulles admitted that the current approach of the United States "is not the key to victory." He then said, "If a major war is triggered, then no one can win." This is how American imperialists have fallen into a helpless predicament.

　　中朝人民部队连续痛歼侵朝美军
    美国在全世界侵略力量大大削弱
    美统治集团承认陷入一筹莫展的厄境
    【新华社六日讯】中朝人民部队在朝鲜战场上痛歼美国侵略军的结果，已使美帝国主义在全世界的侵略力量大大削弱。美国统治集团的重要人物对此已感到严重的恐慌。他们已愈来愈频繁地为美帝国主义的所谓“全球战略地位”的削弱而发出哀鸣。
    据美帝国主义的美联社透露：华盛顿官员于六月一日称，美国政府已训令其驻联合国代表奥斯汀通知联合国秘书长赖伊，声明由于“美国全部可用的军事力量现在都牵制在朝鲜和西欧”，它目前不能为计划中的联合国“集体安全部队”提供任何军队。大家知道，建立所谓联合国“集体安全部队”的计划原来是联合国表决机器于去年秋天在美国国务卿艾奇逊亲自要求下通过的，而现在美国竟表示了这样的心有余而力不足。电通社在评论这一事件时指出：这事实上是“公开承认美国军事力量的脆弱”，它证明“号称‘强大的’美国军事机器的精华已被朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军所摧毁了”。
    正是这种形势，使得美帝国主义分子不能自禁地流露了他们的忧惧。
    历来激烈主张以武力侵略亚洲的共和党参院领袖塔夫脱于上月十九日表示，虽然他对于杜鲁门出兵侵略朝鲜一举起初“并不是非常不满”，但他现在认为那“已证明是一个错误”。他说，美国在朝鲜的战争是“一个失败”，“这个战争的代价将大大地超出我们可能获得的好处”。
    最狂妄的战争贩子麦克阿瑟现在也承认美国要在朝鲜取得胜利是不可能的，而且只有使自己不断受到可悲的消耗。民主党马萨诸塞州众议员肯尼第上月二十九日引述麦克阿瑟向他讲的话说：“我们并没有使他们（按指中朝人民部队）遭受致命的损害，而我们自己却在遭受重大的损失。美国人流的血越来越多了。”
    美国政府的负责官员虽然至今仍企图掩饰他们的严重失败，但是，国务院高级顾问杜勒斯新近所发表的谈话却露骨地反映了美国统治集团的苦闷。这位美国外交政策的重要决策人在五月二十九日向亚利桑那大学学生演说时，无可奈何地承认：美国在侵朝战争中不断失败，对于美帝国主义说来，“包含着三种危险”。第一是以苏联为首的和平阵营实力不断增大。第二是欧亚许多国家人民为保卫和争取民族的独立解放而进行的广泛的武装斗争更加发展。杜勒斯在这里举出了希腊、朝鲜、越南、马来亚和菲律宾人民的反帝民族解放战争。第三是一切资本主义国家内部的人民民主运动日趋高涨，用杜勒斯自己的说法，就叫做“对一切自由国家政府所进行的政治战争”。杜勒斯承认，面对这些情况，美国已陷于严重的困境。他说：“美国已经大大地扩大了它对外国的义务。随着义务的扩大，重整军备的活动也加紧了，这就引起了通货膨胀”。杜勒斯又无限感慨地说：“美国平均一年在朝鲜要遭受十万人的伤亡（按美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷已承认，美侵朝军损失早超过了十四万人），而法国和英国则分别负起在越南和马来亚战争的重担。”因此，杜勒斯承认，美国目前的做法“不是胜利的关键”。他接着又说，“如果引起大战的话，那末，任何人都不能胜利”。美帝国主义者就是这样地陷于一筹莫展的厄境中。
