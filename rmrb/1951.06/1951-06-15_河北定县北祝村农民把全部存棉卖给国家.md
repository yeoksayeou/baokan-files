Farmers in Beizhu Village, Ding County, Hebei,
　　Sell All Their Stored Cotton to the State
　　Under the leadership of the CCP village branch, the farmers of Beizhu Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, responded to the call of the Central People's Government and the CCP Central Committee to sell and store cotton, and sold all their stored cotton to the state in one day and one night. The CCP Branch Committee and all farmers in the village wrote letters to Chairman Mao and the yarn factory workers across the country, reporting on their cotton selling and storing situation.
　　After seeing the CCP Central Committee's instructions on ensuring the completion of the cotton purchasing and storing tasks on June 4th, the CCP Beizhu Village Branch immediately held an emergency meeting, calling on party members to lead farmers in actively responding to the call to sell and store cotton. After all the CCP members and farmers in the village understood that this was a major political task, they used unparalleled patriotic zeal to take out all 1,147 jin of cotton they had stored and sell it to the state in one day and one night.
　　The CCP Beizhu Village Branch Committee wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "The workers are our flesh-and-blood brothers, and we are both masters of the new China. We must do everything we can to support them. Your previous instruction to us on 'mutual assistance between urban and rural areas' is still clearly remembered in our hearts! Under the leadership of all Party and Youth League members in our village, all the farmers in the village enthusiastically launched the cotton selling and storing campaign; everyone sold all the cotton they had stored to the state. Our clothing and food are getting better year by year. This is all the result of the leadership and care of the Party and the People's Government. This year, the government has also loaned us seven waterwheels and 12,000 jin of fertilizer, so that our village's cotton fields have expanded to 1,886 mu. We will definitely do a good job in cotton planting, cultivate carefully, apply fertilizer, and strive for a bumper harvest to ensure the supply of industrial raw materials and support the country's construction." The letter from all the farmers to the yarn factory workers across the country said: "After hearing the news that the yarn factories were short of raw materials, we held various meetings to discuss it. Everyone unanimously stated: The countryside resolutely supports the factories, the farmers resolutely support the workers, your difficulties are our difficulties, and we must never stand idly by. The whole village has launched a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign. We believe that not only our village, but the entire cotton-growing area across the country will support you. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our workers and peasants and the people of the whole country unite as one to support the front, defeat American imperialism, consolidate national defense, and build our new country."

　　河北定县北祝村农民        
    把全部存棉卖给国家
    河北省定县北祝村的农民，在中共村支部带领下，响应中央人民政府和中共中央的售棉储棉号召，一天一夜间，将全部存棉卖给国家。该村中共支部委员会和全体农民并分别向毛主席和全国纱厂工人写信，报告他们售棉存棉的情况。
    中共北祝村支部在六月四日看到中共中央关于保证完成购棉储棉任务的指示后，立即召开紧急会议，号召党员带动农民积极响应售棉储棉的号召。全村中共党员和农民了解到这是一件重大的政治任务后，都用无比的爱国热忱，在一天一夜内，将所存的一千一百四十七斤棉花全部拿出来卖给国家。
    北祝村中共支部委员会写给毛主席的信说：“工人是我们血肉相连的兄弟，我们又同是新中国的主人，我们必须用全力来支援他们。你以前指示我们的‘城乡互助’还在我们心里清清楚楚地记着呢！在俺村全体党、团员的带动下，全村农民就热烈地展开了售棉储棉运动；大家把存下的棉花全部卖给国家。我们的穿和吃，是一年比一年强了。这都是党和人民政府对我们的领导、照顾的结果。今年政府又贷给了水车七辆，肥料一万两千斤，使我村的棉田已扩大到一千八百八十六亩。我们一定做好种棉工作，精耕细作，加工施肥，争取丰收，保证工业原料的供应，支援国家的建设事业。”全体农民给全国纱厂工人的信说：“我们听到纱厂原料缺乏的消息后，便召开了各种会议进行讨论。大家一致表示：农村坚决支援工厂，农民坚决支援工人，你们的困难就是我们的困难，我们绝不能袖手旁观，全村已展开爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。我们相信不但我村这样，全国棉区都会支援你们。在毛主席的领导下，我工农和全国人民一致团结，支援前方，打败美帝国主义，巩固国防，建设我们的新国家。”
