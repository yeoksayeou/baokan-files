Yan Jinfen Writes to Gao Guandou and Others Reporting on the Shutdown of the Cotton Mill
Requests Farmers to Sell Stored Cotton to Support the Mill's Early Resumption of Work

National model worker Yan Jinfen, a female worker at the private Daxing Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, recently wrote a letter to Gao Guandou, Wang Luohe, and Song Luoxue, well-known agricultural model workers in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, requesting them to mobilize farmers to launch a patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing campaign. The original text is as follows:

To Comrades Gao Guandou, Wang Luohe, and Song Luoxue, Agricultural Model Workers:

It has been more than eight months since the closing of the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers last October. I recently saw in the newspaper that the government is calling on farmers in cotton-producing areas to launch a patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing campaign, and I very much wanted to write a letter to you.

Our cotton mill began to shut down on June 6th. I would like to tell you, agricultural model worker comrades, what a shutdown means. It means that 17,632 spindles and 416 looms in our cotton mill have stopped turning; it means that we will reduce production by 46 pieces of yarn (referring to 20-count cotton yarn) and 832 bolts of cloth every day; it means that if we cannot get the support of our farmer comrades and cannot resume work soon, we will not be able to supply enough clothing to the volunteer soldiers, and our farmer comrades will also have difficulty getting clothes and cloth.

On October 21st last year, I returned to the factory from Beijing. In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to support the front lines and increase national defense capabilities, and to meet the needs of farmers after a general harvest across the country, our factory launched a month-long shock production of 20-count yarn and a three-month winter patriotic labor competition from October 25th last year to February this year; from April 1st this year to the present, my production team and another production team, the Zhang Dong production team, have also launched a campaign to learn from the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang team. During these patriotic labor competitions, we have turned the improvement of technology, the improvement of quality, the increase of output, and the saving of raw materials into a long-term production increase movement. We have 100% completed the processing tasks assigned by the state. For example, when we launched the shock production of 20-count yarn last year, the government told us: "This year's rural harvest is good, and farmers need a large amount of yarn and cloth." We responded loudly to this call from the government and completed two months of production tasks in one month, from October 25th to November 24th last year.

Although our factory has temporarily shut down, the morale of the workers is very good, and everyone is enthusiastically studying. This shutdown is different from any shutdown during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. In the past, a shutdown meant no food and unemployment; this time, the government is taking great care of us, and during the shutdown period, we are still paid 75% of our wages. When we first started to mobilize for the shutdown, some workers felt a little discouraged. They said, "We are working so hard! Why are we shutting down?" After mobilization and explanation, they realized that it was because U.S. imperialism was taking advantage of our insufficient raw cotton and adopting a blockade policy against us, not allowing foreign cotton to be imported, which increased our difficulties. Therefore, they hated U.S. imperialism even more and hoped to get the support of farmer comrades to resume work as soon as possible.

Agricultural model worker comrades, we hope that you will tell all the farmer comrades about the situation in our factory, take the lead yourself, mobilize them to sell all the stored cotton to the state at reasonable prices or store it in economic organizations entrusted by the state, and launch a warm patriotic cotton-selling and cotton-storing campaign.

Respectfully yours, with revolutionary greetings,
                                          Yan Jinfen June 9th

　　阎金芬写信给高贯斗等报告纱厂停工情况        
    要求农民出售存棉支援纱厂早日复工
    全国著名劳动模范河北省石家庄市私营大兴纱厂女工阎金芬，最近给河北省产棉区著名农业劳动模范高贯斗、王洛合、宋洛学写了一封信，要求他们动员农民展开爱国售棉储棉运动。原文如下：高贯斗王洛合宋洛学诸位农业劳动模范同志：
    自从去年十月全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议闭幕以后，我们已有八个多月没有见面了。我最近在报上看到政府号召各产棉区农民开展爱国售棉储棉运动，我就很想写一封信给你们。
    我们纱厂是在六月六日开始停工的。我愿意告诉诸位农业劳动模范同志，停工是什么意思？这就是说，我们纱厂有一七、六三二枚纱锭，四一六台织布机停止了转动；这就是说，我们每日要减产纱四六件（指二○支棉纱），布八三二匹；这就是说，我们如果不能得到农民同志们的支援，不能很快复工，我们就不能把足够的衣服供给志愿军的战士们，我们农民同志们穿衣用布也将有困难。
    去年十月二十一日，我从北京回到工厂。我们厂为了抗美援朝，为了支援前线和增加国防力量，为了在全国普遍丰收后，满足农民的需要，从去年十月二十五日起，到今年二月止，接连地展开了一个月的突击二十支纱运动和三个月的冬季爱国劳动竞赛运动；从今年四月一日起到现在止，我的生产小组和另一个小组张栋生产小组又发起了学习马恒昌小组先进生产经验的运动。在这些爱国劳动竞赛运动中间，我们把改进技术，提高质量，增加产量，节约原料变成了长期性的增产运动。我们百分之百地完成了国家交给的加工任务。例如去年发动突击二十支纱运动的时候，政府告诉我们说：“今年农村丰收了，农民需要大量的纱布。”我们响亮地回答了政府这个号召，在去年十月二十五日到十一月二十四日一个月内，完成了两个月的生产任务。
    现在我们工厂虽已暂时停工，但是工友们的情绪都很好，大家正在热烈地进行学习。这次和过去国民党反动派统治时期任何停工都不一样。过去停工，就是没有饭吃，就是失业；这次政府对我们非常照顾，在停工时期，仍按七成五发给工资。我们在开始动员停工的时候，有的工人还感到有点泄气，她们说：“我们正干得有劲呢！为什么要停工？”经过动员解释后，她们了解到这是美帝国主义利用我们原棉不足，对我们采取封锁政策，不让外棉进口，增加了我们的困难，因此，她们对美帝国主义更加痛恨，希望能够得到农民同志的支援早日复工。
    诸位农业劳动模范同志，我们希望你们把我们工厂的情形告诉所有的农民同志，自己带头、发动他们把所有存棉在合理牌价下，卖给国家或者储存到国家委托的经济机关，展开一个热烈的爱国售棉储棉运动。
    谨致革命敬礼
                                          阎金芬  六月九日
