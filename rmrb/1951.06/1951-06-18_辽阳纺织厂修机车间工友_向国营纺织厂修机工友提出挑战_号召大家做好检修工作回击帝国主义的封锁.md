The workers of the repair shop of the Liaoyang Textile Factory have launched a challenge to the repair workers of state-owned textile factories, calling on everyone to do a good job of overhaul work and fight back against the imperialist blockade.

After the Liaoyang Textile Factory temporarily suspended operations due to difficulties in the supply of raw cotton, all the workers in the repair shop, led by labor model Wang Shaozeng, wrote a letter challenging the repair departments of state-owned cotton textile factories across the country, calling on everyone to use practical actions of doing a good job of overhaul and improving the quality of yarn and cloth to fight back against the imperialist blockade. The original letter is as follows:

Comrades of the repair departments of all cotton textile industries under the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government:

The unreasonable blockade of imperialism has caused temporary difficulties for our textile industry. However, history proves that the heroic Chinese people have no difficulties they cannot overcome. We believe that the People's Government will complete the raw cotton procurement plan in the near future. We must take this opportunity to completely repair the textile machines that have been in disrepair for many years, and further improve the quality of cloth and yarn. We will use this effective practical action to fight back against the imperialist conspiracy and support the Chinese People's Volunteers to drive the American imperialists out of Korea as soon as possible!

We, the entire workers of the repair shop of the Liaoyang Textile Factory, under the leadership of Comrade Wang Shaozeng, a national labor model representative, propose the following conditions for a friendly overhaul competition to you comrades:

　　One, during the overhaul period, we will definitely cultivate two Ma Hengchang-style advanced production groups.

　　Two, ensure that the product quality reaches more than 98%, resolutely produce no defective products, and complete the task ahead of schedule.

　　Three, establish a safety production responsibility system to ensure the safety of mechanical personnel and prevent accidents.

　　Four, abide by labor discipline, obey leadership, and ensure that the attendance rate reaches more than 98%.

　　Five, reduce workshop costs, ensure that no piece of iron, drop of oil, or bit of electricity is wasted, and make as much use of waste materials as possible.

　　Six, raise vigilance, do a good job in four preventions (anti-espionage, anti-sabotage, anti-theft, and anti-fire), resolutely expose counter-revolutionaries, and defend the factory.

    我们辽阳纺织厂修机车间全体工友，在全国劳动模范代表王绍曾同志的带动下，向同志们提出友谊的检修竞赛条件如下：
    一、在检修期间，我们一定培养成两个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。
    二、保证产品质量达到百分之九十八以上，坚决不出次品，提前完成任务。
    三、建立安全生产责任制，保证机械人员的安全，不出事故。
    四、遵守劳动纪律，服从领导，保证出勤率达到百分之九十八以上。
    五、降低车间成本，保证不浪费一块铁、一滴油、一点电，尽量利用废物。
    六、提高警惕性，作好四防工作，坚决检举反革命分子，保卫工厂。
                       辽阳纺织厂修机车间全体工友  六月一日
