Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Bangkok:

U.S. imperialism, in preparation for expanding its war of aggression, is currently actively reorganizing and equipping the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who have fled into Burma and Thailand. U.S. imperialism has colluded with the Phibun reactionary government, using Thailand as a transit point, and is transporting large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and Thai-produced rice by plane, train, and truck to the Thai-Burma border to support the remnant bandits. Under direct U.S. command, these remnant bandits are engaged in reorganization and have established "recruiting stations" in Bangkok, attempting to organize an "International Anti-Communist Volunteer Army" to cooperate with the Phibun army, awaiting an opportunity to attack Vietnam and harass our border.

The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to utilize the remnant bandits fleeing Burma had been secretly underway since before August of last year. U.S., British imperialists, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents held a meeting in Bangkok, deciding to force the Kengtung government of Burma not to seize the weapons of the remnant bandits, and to protect and supply them with arms and food. In August, the United States sent two secret agents to make arrangements; on the one hand, instructing the remnant bandits to continue to occupy Burmese territory, and on the other hand, through Chen Zhenxi, the military attaché of the Taiwan bandit embassy in Bangkok, requesting the Thai government to allow some of the bandit troops to enter Thai territory. The Thai government also allocated 500 rai (one rai equals 1,600 square meters) of land in Nan Province in northern Thailand to accommodate them.

When the U.S. delegation headed by Melby-Erskine arrived in Thailand last August, they established a plan to aid the remnant bandits, deciding that the U.S. would supply arms, the Phibun government would supply food, and made clear provisions in the secret clauses of the "Thai-U.S. Military Assistance Agreement". After the U.S. "Economic and Technical Representative Group" arrived in Thailand in December of the same year, they then organized a large-scale "inspection team" to conduct investigations in the northern Thai area in January of this year.

At the conference of U.S. diplomatic envoys stationed in Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma held in Bangkok last December, a final decision was made on the issue of aiding the remnant bandits. U.S. Senators Glenn, Ferguson, and State Department representative Wenner made a special trip to attend this conference. Also present were U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Stanton, Ambassador to Burma Keyes, and Chen Zhenxi, the military attaché of the Taiwan bandits in Thailand.

According to the decisions of this conference, the United States has strengthened the work of supplying weapons to the remnant bandits on the Thai-Burma border since January of this year. In order to supervise the distribution of weapons, U.S. imperialism opened a consulate in Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand in December of last year. Subsequently, with the approval of the Thai government, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "office", directly under the command of the U.S. consulate, was also established in Yexi in northern Thailand, and a radio station was set up to maintain contact with the Taiwan bandits and the remnant bandits in northern Burma. The so-called "office" is actually the command post for the remnant bandits on the Thai-Burma border, the distribution station for U.S. arms, and the refuge for the remnant bandits in northern Burma. The Burmese government protested to the Thai side about this, and the Thai government had no choice but to superficially order the abolition of the bandit "office", but in reality, it continued to implement the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to actively aid the remnant bandits.

### 美帝国主义勾结銮披汶反动政府  进行整编逃缅残匪阴谋计划

　　美帝国主义勾结銮披汶反动政府
    进行整编逃缅残匪阴谋计划
    【新华社二十一日讯】曼谷消息：美帝国主义为准备扩大侵略战争，最近正在积极整编和装备逃窜缅甸及泰国境内的蒋匪残余部队。美帝国主义勾结了銮披汶反动政府，利用泰国作转运站，正将大批的武器、弹药和泰国出产的大米，用飞机、火车和卡车运往泰缅边境，接济残匪。在美国直接指挥下，该部残匪正从事整编，并在曼谷设立了“招兵站”，妄图组织“国际反共志愿军”，配合銮披汶军队，待机进攻越南，窜扰我国边境。
    美帝国主义利用逃缅残匪的阴谋，早在去年八月以前即已秘密进行。美、英帝国主义及蒋匪特务曾在曼谷召开会议，决定强制缅甸景栋政府不得收缴残匪枪械，并加以保护和供给军火和粮食。八月间，美国派了特务两名前往布置；一面指示残匪继续盘据缅境，一面通过台匪驻曼谷使馆武官陈振熙，向泰政府要求准许部分匪军进入泰境。泰政府并在泰北喃邦府划出土地五百莱（按一莱等于一千六百平方公尺）予以收容。
    去年八月，以梅尔拜——厄斯琴为首的美国代表团到泰国时，订下了接济该部残匪的计划，决定由美方供给军火，銮披汶政府供给粮食，并在“泰美军事援助协定”秘密条款中作了明白的规定。同年十二月，美“经济技术代表团”抵泰后，接着组织了大规模的“视察团”，于今年一月间前往泰北一带进行调查。
    去年十二月，在曼谷召开的美国驻泰、越、缅外交使节会议上，对接济残匪问题作了最后决定。美参议员格伦、福开森和国务院代表文纳，曾特地赶去参加这次会议。出席的还有美驻泰大使史丹顿、驻缅大使基伊和台匪驻泰武官陈振熙等。
    根据这次会议的决定，从今年一月起，美国就加强了以武器补给泰缅边境残匪的工作。为了监督武器的分配，美帝国主义于去年十二月在泰北清迈府开设了领事馆。接着，受美领馆直接指挥的蒋匪“办事处”，也经泰政府批准在泰北夜柿设立，并设有无线电台与台匪及缅北残匪保持联系。所谓“办事处”，实际上就是泰缅边境残匪的指挥部，美国军火的分配站，以及缅北残匪的避难所。缅政府为此向泰方提出抗议，泰政府只好表面上下令撤消匪“办事处”，但实际上仍继续执行着美帝国主义积极接济残匪的阴谋计划。
