    (7) However, the joy was immediately replaced by disappointment, because the machine vibrated particularly violently, making it impossible to connect to the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan power grids. Liu Dezhen didn't even bother to eat, and went straight to the shift, circling around the No. 6 machine. His oily hands, stained black, constantly scratched his scalp. He often used his ears to listen to the sound of the machine running.
    (8) He finally found the problem. It took great effort and a lot of time to hear a special "swish! swish!" sound inside the generator. He immediately suggested to the administration that the machine be stopped for inspection. Finally, a piece of wood was found inside the machine. Comrade Liu Dezhen used this incident to raise the political vigilance of the workers. He said to the workers: "We must not forget what Chairman Mao told us about 'enemies without guns'." He also organized the defense of the No. 6 machine.

    （七）可是，马上高兴又被打回去了，因为机器震动特别大，不能往北京、天津、唐山电力纲里运转。刘德珍连饭郭顾不得吃了，到班上就围着六号机打转转。黑忽忽的油手不断的抓脑爪皮。经常用耳朵去听机器转动的声音。
    （八）毛病终于让他找出来了，用了很大力量，很多时间才听得发电机里有一种特别的“刷！刷！”的小声音。于是马上向行政建议，行政上把机器停下来，检查一次。终于在机器里发现了一块木头。刘德珍同志用这件事，提高工友们的政治警惕性。他向工人们说：“我们不能忘了毛主席告诉我们的‘不拿枪的敌人’”。他又组织了六号机的保卫工作。
    （九）刘德珍白天积极干活，下了班又忙工会和党的工作，晚上还经常学习到深夜。他知道共产党员要不断进步，就必须学习。
