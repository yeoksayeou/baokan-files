The Guangzhou Southern Daily published an article by Li Zhifu, a professor in the History Department of Lingnan University, on May 30th entitled "Confession of the Atrocities of American Imperialism in the 'May Thirtieth' Massacre." Excerpts are as follows:

The great massacre of workers and students by imperialists in Shanghai on May 30, 1925, was the most vicious and shameless bloody atrocity. Many people know that the main culprits who created this great massacre were British and Japanese imperialism. But in fact, among the main culprits whose hands were stained with the blood of the Chinese people, there was also a sinister and vicious American imperialism. On that day, the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Marines stationed in Shanghai fully cooperated with Britain and Japan in massacring the Chinese people.

On the anniversary of the "May Thirtieth" incident, patriotic people in Shanghai discovered a document, which was translated and printed at that time, along with photocopies of two pages of the original (the original is now kept in the Lingnan University Library). According to the translator's preface, the original was a letter written by Smith Lori to an American named Hanks in Chicago after the "May Thirtieth" massacre. Smith Lori was a member of the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce, an American "entrepreneur" residing in Shanghai. During the "May Thirtieth" incident, he served as a temporary volunteer inspector in the Laoza Gate Police Station and was a executioner who participated in directing the massacre of the Chinese people.

In this letter, Smith Lori first described the tragic scene of the massacre he witnessed, saying: "On the day of the riot (referring to the patriotic actions of the Chinese people - note by the author of this article, same below), I went to the Laoza Gate Police Station to serve, and I was assigned there right after the shooting started. At that time, I was at the gate of the police station, making my way through the general riff-raff (falsely accusing the Chinese working people), when someone threw a stone at me. Immediately, there was a bang, and eight people were shot, four of whom died outside the police station gate, and many more dead and wounded were lying crookedly in the middle of the street." "The blood splattered on the door was eight feet high, and the road became slippery because of the excessive bleeding. The people who died in the front row were simply smashed to pieces, because we used Colt .45 caliber rifles." This executioner went on to describe their atrocities against the Chinese people in the letter with great satisfaction: "There were eighteen or nineteen of us in total, all holding baseball bats, like Irish ones, very thick and not easy to break. I have already broken two. We broke the necks of many Chinese people, broke the heads of twelve or thirteen Chinese people, crushed the spine of one person, and smashed many faces, noses, hands, and feet. After dinner, we put on our full gear and confronted them (referring to the act of killing unarmed Chinese people), killing more than a dozen Chinese people. Later, we drove armored cars, with steel walls more than an inch thick, with gun mounts and machine guns, equipped like tanks, and these two cars drove at full speed straight into the crowd. The tragic scene that occurred after this car drove past was really terrible. Two people were crushed to death, and the internal organs of these two people were splattered all over the street, and most of the people who escaped had their hands and feet crushed."

Smith Lori wrote: "After the riots broke out, we and the British have repeatedly cooperated sincerely. We have a common goal: in this Chinese riot, we Europeans and Americans (meaning all imperialists) must unite to fight (to carry out the massacre)." Finally, Smith Lori also specifically mentioned: "American sailors are the treasures of Shanghai. They surround the suburbs of Shanghai and have very good military tactical experience. Without any effort, they suppressed the riot in Shanghai." The letter also described how they burned Chinese people alive in streetcars, how American sailors crossed the border to shoot Chinese soldiers, and the various atrocities committed by American sailors when they occupied Tongde Medical University.

This is a reckless confession by American executioners. We must not think that the above quotation is just a letter from a member of the American Chamber of Commerce and ignore the serious facts it exposes. This is not the crime of one person, but the most concrete manifestation of the consistent policy of aggression adopted by American imperialism towards the Chinese people. Shortly after the "May Thirtieth" massacre, the American reactionary newspaper *The New Republic* advocated that "a coalition army of 200,000 British, French, American, and Japanese troops should directly attack and occupy Beijing, and then gradually divide the country."

In the past, accounts of the historical facts of the May Thirtieth Movement have almost all ignored the ironclad fact that American imperialism shouldered the main task in the bloody massacre of the Chinese people. We must add it in the future.

### 美帝国主义在“五卅”惨案中的暴行的供状

　　美帝国主义在“五卅”惨案中的暴行的供状
    广州南方日报五月三十日刊载岭南大学历史系教授李稚甫所作题为《“五卅”惨案中美帝国主义暴行的自供状》的文章。择要如下：
    一九二五年五月三十日，帝国主义者在上海屠杀工人、学生群众的大惨案，是最狠毒无耻的血腥暴行。制造这个大惨案的主要凶犯，许多人只知道是英帝国主义和日本帝国主义。但实际上，在双手染满中国人民鲜血的主要凶犯当中，还有一个阴狠恶毒的美帝国主义。那一天，美国商团和驻在上海的美国陆战队，曾与英、日完全合作，对中国人民大肆屠杀。
    在“五卅”周年纪念时，上海爱国人民发现了一份文件，当时曾把它翻译印行，并影印原文两页（原件现存岭南大学图书馆）。根据译序所说，原件是史密斯·洛梨在“五卅”惨案发生后，写给住在芝加哥的一个名叫罕克的美国人的一封信。史密斯·洛梨是上海美国商团团员，是侨寓上海的美国“企业家”，“五卅”时他在老闸捕房充当临时义务巡官，是参加指挥屠杀中国人民的刽子手。
    在这封信中，史密斯·洛梨首先叙述自己亲眼所见屠杀的惨状说：“在暴动（指中国人民的爱国行动——本文作者注，下同）的那天，我到老闸捕房去服务，这是刚开过枪的时候把我编进去的。其时我在巡捕房门口，穿过一般下流群众（诬称中国劳动人民），走我自己的路，有人拿石子来掷我，随即听见乓的一声，登时就有八个人吃着枪弹，四个人死在捕房门外头，还有许多死的、伤的都歪斜地躺在街心。”“门上溅血有八英尺高，路上因为流血过多，渐渐泞滑起来，他们死在前一排的人，简直被打成碎块，因为我们用的是柯利特四十五号式的快枪。”这个刽子手在信上接着又得意地述说他们怎样残害中国人民的暴行：“我们一共十八九个人，都拿着打棒球用的棍子，同爱尔兰式一样，很粗很不容易断的，我已经打坏了两根。我们打断了许多中国人的颈骨，打坏了十二三个中国人的脑袋，捶碎了一个人的脊背；打烂了许多面孔、鼻子、手、脚。饭后我们着起全副武装，同他们对敌（指对徒手的中国人民行凶），打死了十多个中国人。后来我们开起铁甲汽车，钢壁有一英寸多厚，上面有炮架子，有机关枪，装制得好像坦克车一样，这两辆汽车开足马力，直往人堆里冲去。这个车子开过去之后，发生的惨状，真是厉害得很，压死了两个人，这两个人的内脏，溅得满街都是，逃避的人也大半压碎了手足”。
    史密斯·洛梨写道：“在暴乱起来之后，我们和英国人屡次诚意合作，我们有共同的目的：在这一次中国人暴乱之中，我们欧美各国人（按即各帝国主义者），要联合起来作战（进行屠杀）。”最后，史密斯·洛梨还特别提到：“美国水兵是上海的宝贝，他们包围上海四郊，军事战术的经验很好，不费丝毫气力，便镇压了暴动的上海。”信中还叙述他们怎样把中国人民活活关在电车内烧死，美国水兵越界枪杀中国士兵，以及美国水兵攻占同德医科大学时的种种暴行。
    这是美国刽子手们如何肆无忌惮的自供状。我们不能以为这上面引述的只是一个美国商团团员的信，而忽略了它所暴露出来的严重事实，这不是一个人的罪行，而是代表美帝国主义对中国人民一贯采取侵略政策的最具体的表现。在“五卅”大惨案发生不久，美国反动报纸《新共和周报》就主张以“英、法、美、日联军二十万，直攻北京而占据之，徐图瓜分办法”。
    过去纪述五卅运动史实的，差不多都忽略了美帝国主义在对中国人民血腥的屠杀中担负了主要任务的铁一般的事实，我们今后必须把它补充进去。
