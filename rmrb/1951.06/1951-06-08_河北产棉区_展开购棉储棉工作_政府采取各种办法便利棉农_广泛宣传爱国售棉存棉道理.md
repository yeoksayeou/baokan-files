　　Hebei Cotton-Producing Areas
    Launch Cotton Purchase and Storage Work
    Government Adopts Various Measures to Facilitate Cotton Farmers; Extensive Propaganda on the Principles of Patriotic Cotton Sales and Storage

    Hebei's cotton-producing areas are currently extensively engaged in cotton purchase and storage work.

    Hebei's cotton-producing areas, which account for a quarter of the country's cotton planting area, had only completed 71.5 percent of the first quarter's cotton purchase task in the past because the national trading company's propaganda and education work on cotton farmers' patriotism was poor, cotton prices were lower than market prices, and the supply of materials needed by cotton farmers was not timely. This time, in order to ensure the completion of the national cotton purchase and storage tasks, the Baoding, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Dingxian special districts of Hebei Province will hold cadre meetings, cotton farmer representative meetings, and propaganda worker representative meetings respectively. Working cadres of the people's governments and CCP party committee organs in the above-mentioned special districts and localities will also write letters to relatives and friends to promote the principles of patriotic cotton sales and storage. The Financial Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government has adjusted cotton prices according to the instructions of the Trade Department of the Central People's Government, so that the prices are on par with market prices. Hebei's state-owned grain, coal, and department store companies will transfer more than 11.9 million jin of grain, 240,000 tons of coal, and a large number of department store goods to cotton-producing areas in exchange for cotton. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the People's Bank, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and cooperatives have also agreed that the monthly interest rate for cotton farmers' cotton storage is one cent and two li, guaranteeing principal and value, listening to rises but not falls; various methods such as paying in full or in installments, and wanting goods or money, all provide cotton farmers with convenience in many ways. The People's Governments and economic work departments of the CCP Party Committees in Dingxian, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtai special districts have successively established cotton purchase committees or joint cotton purchase offices to strengthen leadership over cotton purchase work. With the approval of the higher-level government, the Qingyuan County People's Government has temporarily reorganized the five offices of the county's People's Bank and supply and marketing cooperative into cotton purchasing stations. Each purchasing station is equipped with one bank work cadre to handle cotton storage procedures. All 72 grassroots cooperatives in the county will purchase cotton on behalf of the state in accordance with the instructions of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. Forty market towns in the county will set up cotton purchasing stalls to facilitate cotton farmers' cotton sales. The industrial and commercial administrative departments of the Hebei Provincial People's Government have also instructed people's governments at all levels to organize joint cotton purchases, centralize transactions, and strictly prohibit illegal acts such as adulterating cotton, adding water, and raising prices, hoarding, and refusing to sell.

    In addition, the people's governments and CCP Party Committees in Dingxian, Baoding, and other special districts and some counties have also sent many cadres to the countryside to participate in cotton purchase and storage work, striving to complete two-thirds of the cotton purchase task by the end of June and all of it by mid-July.

　　河北产棉区
    展开购棉储棉工作
    政府采取各种办法便利棉农  广泛宣传爱国售棉存棉道理
    河北产棉区现正广泛开展购棉存棉工作。
    占全国植棉面积四分之一的河北产棉区，过去国家贸易公司在购棉工作中由于对棉农爱国主义的宣传教育工作较差，棉花牌价低于市价，以及对棉农所需物资的供应不及时，第一季度的购棉任务只完成百分之七十一点五。这次，为了保证国家购棉储棉任务的完成，河北省保定、邢台、石家庄、定县等专区将分别举行干部会议、棉农代表会议、宣传员代表会议，上述各专区各地人民政府、中共党委机关的工作干部也将写信给亲友，宣传爱国售棉储棉的道理。河北省人民政府财委会已根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示调整了棉花的牌价，使牌价与市价齐平。河北省国营粮食、煤业、百货等公司即将调运粮食一千一百九十多万斤、煤炭二十四万吨和大批百货到产棉区换购棉花。河北省人民政府财政经济委员会及人民银行、花纱布公司、合作社又商定了棉农储棉的月息为一分二厘，保本保值，听涨不听落；整零存付及要物要钱等各项办法，也都多方面给棉农以便利。定县、石家庄、邢台专区的人民政府和中共党委的经济工作部门已先后建立了购棉委员会或购棉联合办公室，加强对购棉工作的领导。清苑县人民政府并已在征得上级政府同意后，将该县人民银行和供销社的五个办事处暂时改组为棉花收购站。每个收购站内配备有银行工作干部一人，办理储棉手续。该县七十二个基层合作社都将根据全国合作总社的指示代国家收购棉花。该县四十个集镇将设立棉花收购摊，便利棉农售棉。河北省人民政府工商行政部门并已指示各级人民政府组织棉花联购，集中成交，严格取缔棉花掺杂、掺水和抬价、囤积拒售等不法行为。
    此外，定县、保定等专区和有些县的人民政府和中共党委并已派了很多干部下乡参加购棉存棉工作，争取在六月底完成购棉任务的三分之二，七月中旬全部完成。
