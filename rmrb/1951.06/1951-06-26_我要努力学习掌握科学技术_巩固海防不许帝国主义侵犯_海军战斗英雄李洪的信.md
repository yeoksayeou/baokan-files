　　I Will Strive to Learn and Master Science and Technology, Consolidate Coastal Defense, and Forbid Imperialist Aggression
　　-- Letter from Naval Combat Hero Li Hong

Respected Chairman Mao:

The thirtieth anniversary of the birth of the great Chinese Communist Party has arrived. This festival is not only the glory of the people of the whole country, but also the glory of the people of the whole world!

For thirty years, under your wise leadership, the Party has carried out arduous and tortuous struggles; it has not only eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also shattered the imperialist plots of aggression, and achieved today's great victory.

I was a soldier liberated in the Jinan Campaign in September 1948. Before liberation, I suffered unspeakable hardships, endured countless beatings and scoldings, and never had a happy day. After liberation, the Party cared for me, cultivated me, and educated me; I deeply felt the warmth of the Party and realized the greatness of the Party. Since then, I have continuously improved ideologically and politically, especially in the past year of study, I have made greater achievements. In the past, I was illiterate, but now I am already reading the sixth volume of the national language, and I can read and understand the Party newspaper. In terms of technology, I can undertake all the assigned tasks of naval gun operation, shooting, and seamanship. Politically, I have further distinguished between enemies and friends, and realized why we should make revolution and how to make revolution.

I am determined, under the leadership of the Party, to improve my political and cultural level in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, intensify my technical studies, master modern science and technology, and consolidate our coastal defense. If the imperialists dare to invade our motherland, we will resolutely eliminate them in the ocean!

I respectfully wish you good health forever!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Naval Combat Hero Representative Li Hong

　　我要努力学习掌握科学技术  巩固海防不许帝国主义侵犯
    ——海军战斗英雄李洪的信敬爱的毛主席：
    伟大的中国共产党诞生三十周年纪念日来到了。这个节日，不仅是全国人民的光荣，而且是全世界人民的光荣！
    三十年来，党在你的英明领导下，进行了艰苦曲折的斗争；不但消灭了国民党反动派，而且粉碎了帝国主义的侵略阴谋，取得了今天的伟大胜利。
    我是一九四八年九月济南战役解放的一个战士。在解放前，受了诉不尽的苦，挨了数不清的打骂，从没有过一天愉快的生活。解放后，党爱护我、培养我、教育我；我深深感到党的温暖，体会到党的伟大。从此，我在思想上、政治上不断地提高，特别在这一年来的学习当中，有更大的成绩。过去我是一个文盲，现在已经在读第六册的国语了，党报也能读下来，解释通了。在技术上，对舰炮操作、射击、船艺所分配的任务，都能担负了。在政治上，更进一步地分清了敌友，认识到了为什么要革命和怎样革命。
    我决心在党的领导下，在抗美援朝运动中，提高政治和文化水平，加紧技术学习，掌握现代化科学技术，巩固我们的海防。如果帝国主义胆敢来侵犯我们的祖国，就坚决把它消灭在海洋上！敬祝您身体永远健康！
            海军战斗英雄代表  李洪
