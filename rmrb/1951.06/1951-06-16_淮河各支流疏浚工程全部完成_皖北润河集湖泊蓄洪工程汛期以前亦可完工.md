　　The Huai River Tributary Dredging Projects Completed
    Runheji Lake Flood Storage Project in Northern Anhui Expected to Be Completed Before Flood Season
    After nearly half a year of intense Huai River harnessing work, the broad masses of people in the Huai River basin have now basically conquered the threat of what was previously known as "minor rains, minor disasters." Currently, the flood control projects being constructed to conquer "major rains, major disasters" and "no rain, drought disasters" are being accelerated.
    The frequent disasters in the Huai River basin are mainly caused by the siltation of its water system. Ever since the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River during the Song and Ming dynasties, the Huai River's drainage and irrigation capacity has been weakened due to siltation, and the saying "nine out of ten harvests fail" in the folk songs of northern Anhui is due to this reason. The Yellow River breach created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1938 further damaged the entire Huai River water system. Since then, the Huai River basin has often been plagued by waterlogging even after minor rains.
    Since the start of the Huai River harnessing project last winter, the three provinces along the Huai River—Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu—have been preparing to store floodwaters under the unified command of the Huai River Harnessing Committee to reduce the flow of the Huai River during the flood season, while also vigorously carrying out dredging work on various tributaries. In Henan Province, the dredged rivers include the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River; in northern Anhui Province, they include the Sui River, East Fei River, and West Fei River. To dredge these rivers, nearly three million civilian laborers participated in the work last winter and this spring, completing nearly 100 million cubic meters of earthwork. These dredging projects have now all been completed. Due to the completion of these river dredging projects, the phenomenon of waterlogging disasters on both sides of the Huai River can be basically eliminated in the future under conditions of relatively small rainfall.
    Flood control projects are now being carried out separately in Henan and northern Anhui provinces. The flood control project in Henan is a valley reservoir. Since the spring of this year, the province has selected three sites where reservoirs can be built and started construction. Among them, the Shimantan site has taken initial shape and is expected to be completed before the flood season. Before the permanent reservoir projects in the valleys of Henan and other places are fully completed, the Runheji Lake flood storage project under construction in northern Anhui is of particular importance in order to cope with the current flood season and to effectively control floods within the next two or three years so that they do not overflow and cause disasters. This project is estimated to store more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Since the start of construction, thanks to the round-the-clock work of 30,000 civilian laborers, technical workers, and hundreds of cadres and engineering personnel, more than half of the entire project has now been completed. Before the flood season this year, this huge project, which is crucial in the entire Huai River harnessing work, can also be fully completed.

### 淮河各支流疏浚工程全部完成  皖北润河集湖泊蓄洪工程汛期以前亦可完工

　　淮河各支流疏浚工程全部完成
    皖北润河集湖泊蓄洪工程汛期以前亦可完工
    淮河流域的广大人民，经过了将近半年紧张的治淮工作，现在已经基本上征服了过去所谓“小雨小灾”的威胁。目前，为征服“大雨大灾”和“无雨旱灾”而建筑的拦蓄洪水工程，正在加紧进行。
    淮河流域灾害的频繁，主要是它的水系被泥沙淤塞而造成的。远自宋朝及明朝黄河夺淮开始，淮河即因泥沙淤塞而被削弱了排泄和灌溉的能力，皖北民谣中所说的“十有九荒”就是由于这种原因造成。一九三八年蒋介石匪帮所制造的黄河决堤，更进一步破坏了整个淮河的水系，从此，淮河流域即在小雨之后也常积水成灾。
    去年冬季治淮工程开始，河南、皖北和苏北三个沿淮省区除在治淮委员会统一指挥下进行准备拦蓄洪水，以便在洪水期减少淮河流量之外，同时也大力进行了各个支流的疏浚工作。在河南境内被疏浚的有洪河、汝河、颍河等河流，在皖北境内有濉河、东肥河、西肥河等河流。为了疏浚这些河流，去冬及今春参加工作的民工几达三百万人，完成土方将近一亿公方。现在这些疏浚工程业已全部结束。由于这些河流疏浚工程的完成，今后在雨水较小的情况下，淮河两岸积水成灾的现象已可基本消除。
    拦蓄洪水的工程现在是在河南和皖北两个省区分别进行。河南拦蓄洪水的工程是山谷水库，今年春天以来该省已在若干可以修建水库的地方选择了三处施工，其中石漫滩一处已初具规模，预计在汛期以前可以完成。在河南的山谷水库以及其它地方的永久性的水库工程全部完成以前，为了应付目前的洪水季节，为了在最近三两年内有效地控制洪水使其不致泛滥成灾，皖北境内正在进行中的润河集湖泊蓄洪工程有着特殊重要意义。这个工程估计能拦蓄七十二亿多立方公尺洪水。开工以来由于三万民工、技术工人和数百个干部及工程人员昼夜加工的结果，现在也已完成了整个工程的半数以上。今年汛期以前，这个在整个治淮工作中具有关键性的巨大工程亦可全部完成。
