Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 31st (TASS): The International Student Union issued a statement celebrating International Children's Day, saying: In the struggle of the people of all countries to defend world peace and oppose a new world war, International Children's Day has become a day to fight for children's rights to survival, welfare, education, and a happy future. Today, our responsibility to protect children is even greater than in the past. No upright person can remain indifferent to the shooting of Korean children. The struggle for children's rights, democratic education, and a happy life is one of the main tasks of students worldwide today. Strengthening our ranks to fight against remilitarization, signing the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and participating in the signature collection campaign—this is the best way for students around the world to defend children's rights and the bright future of youth.

    国际儿童节国际学联发表声明
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社布拉格五月三十一日讯：国际学生联合会发表庆祝国际儿童节的声明说：在各国人民保卫世界和平反对新世界大战的斗争中，国际儿童节已经变成为争取儿童的生存、福利、教育及幸福将来的权利而斗争的日子。今天我们保卫儿童的责任已经比过去更加重大了。没有一个正直的人能够对枪杀朝鲜儿童的事件漠不关心。为争取儿童权利、民主教育和幸福生活而斗争，是全世界学生当前的主要任务之一。紧密自己的队伍为反对重新军国主义化而斗争、在世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名并参加征集签名运动——这就是全世界学生保卫儿童权利及青年的美好前途的最好办法。
