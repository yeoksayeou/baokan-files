Wanquan County Magistrate Reports to Chairman Mao
Liu Hulan's Murderer, Zhang Quanbao, Arrested
Also Writes Letter to Comrade Liu Hulan's Mother

In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Wanquan County, Shanxi Province, captured the murderer of Comrade Liu Hulan, the bandit Zhang Quanbao. The county magistrate of the county, Wang Qinsheng, specially reported this to Chairman Mao. The original report is as follows:

Chairman Mao:
Since we mobilized the masses to vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries, we have captured many extremely wicked secret agents, one of whom is the past murderer of Comrade Liu Hulan – “Big Beard” Zhang Quanbao. He is from Yuncheng and served as an instructor in the machine gun company and the second company of the first battalion of the 215th Regiment of the 72nd Division of Yan Xishan's bandit army. At that time, this bandit and another bandit Xu Desheng (company commander) killed Comrade Liu Hulan, with Zhang Quanbao being the principal culprit. In the past, we all thought he had been killed, but who would have thought he was still alive. This criminal was exposed by the detained secret agent Wang Liancheng (formerly the company's intelligence chief) and Fu Yongqing, the deputy battalion commander of the second battalion of the 215th Regiment. In order to avenge Comrade Liu Hulan, we captured him on May 8th. He has fully admitted to the matter of killing Comrade Liu Hulan (in the past, the "Big Beard" in the "Liu Hulan" opera should have been the bandit Zhang Quanbao instead of the bandit Xu Desheng). In the past, our paralyzing thoughts were very serious. From this incident, from the Jishan incident last year (note), and from this year's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we have received a profound education. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the masses have also received a good education. The arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries has been severely hit. Now there are fewer rumors, social order is stable, and various tasks have undergone new changes. The masses are applauding and cheering. This is the result of your wise leadership. But we are not complacent because of this. We will continue to rely on the masses, consolidate the unity of the people of all strata, and deeply carry out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Regarding the bandit Zhang Quanbao, interrogation is continuing, and we are preparing to severely punish him. This is a special report.

With respect,
		Wanquan County Magistrate, Shanxi Province, Wang Qinsheng, May 19th

To Comrade Hu Wenxiu, Mother of Hulan:

Now I am reporting to you an extremely exciting matter. We have already captured your dearest daughter's murderer on May 8th. His name is Zhang Quanbao. He was the instructor of the machine gun company and the second company of the first battalion of the 215th Regiment of Yan's 61st Army 72nd Division. Comrade Hulan was killed by this bandit and bandit army company commander Xu Desheng, and he was the principal culprit. According to the current true understanding, the "Big Beard" is him. But now he has shaved his beard. In the past, we all thought he had been killed, but who would have thought he was still alive. However, no matter how cunning the enemy is, he will eventually not escape the people's net. Today, in the tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the bandit Zhang Quanbao has been caught. When we saw in the newspaper that you called on mothers across the country to avenge their dead daughters, it aroused our unparalleled anger towards the enemy, and we were determined to avenge Comrade Liu Hulan. Sure enough, the day of revenge has arrived today. Now we have taken him to prison. Everyone who hears this news is happily jumping and cheering. The bandit Zhang has confessed all the facts without dispute. Now a copy of the bandit Zhang's confession and photo are sent to you. You will know when you see it.

With respect,
		Wanquan County Magistrate Wang Qinsheng, May 19th

(Note) The Jishan Incident was the counter-revolutionary armed riot held by bandits Du Xinyou and others in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, on November 19, 1950. These bandits killed eight of our village cadres and also killed Jia Yangyi, the chief of the Finance and Grain Section of our Jishan County People's Government. The Jishan People's Armed Forces, in coordination with the public security forces, immediately defeated the bandits, and the military and civilians worked together to pursue and arrest them, capturing 162 bandits including the bandit leader Du Xinyou. Seven bandit leaders including Du Xinyou have been executed by firing squad.

　　万泉县长向毛主席报告
    杀害刘胡兰的凶犯张全宝落网
    并写信向刘胡兰同志的母亲报告
    山西省万泉县在镇压反革命运动中捕获了杀害刘胡兰同志的凶犯张匪全宝。该县县长王沁声为此特向毛主席报告。报告原文如下：毛主席：
    我们发动群众大张旗鼓地镇压反革命以来，抓住了许多罪大恶极的特务，其中的一个便是过去杀害刘胡兰同志的凶犯——“大胡子”张全宝。他是运城人，曾在阎锡山匪部六十一军七十二师二一五团一营机枪连和第二连担任指导员。当时杀害刘胡兰同志的就是这个匪徒与另一匪徒徐得胜（连长），张全宝则是主犯。过去我们都以为已把他打死了，谁料想他还活着。该犯是由在押的特务王匪连城（原是该连特务长）和二一五团二营副营长傅匪永清揭露出来的。我们为了给刘胡兰同志报仇，于五月八日将他捕获。他已全部承认杀害刘胡兰同志的事情（过去“刘胡兰”歌剧中的大胡子应是张匪全宝而不是徐匪得胜）。过去我们的麻痹思想十分严重。从这一件事情，从去年的稷山事件（注），从今年镇压反革命运动中，我们受到了深刻的教育。在镇压反革命运动中，群众也受到了很好的教育。反革命的气焰已受到严重打击。现在谣言也少了，社会秩序也安定了，各种工作有了新的转变，群众都拍手称快。这是您英明领导的结果。但我们不因此而自满，我们将继续依靠群众，巩固地团结各阶层人民，深入展开镇压反革命工作。关于张匪全宝，现在正继续审讯，准备严惩。特此报告。
    此致敬礼
                            山西省万泉县县长王沁声  五月十九日胡兰的妈妈胡文秀同志：
    现在向你报告一件极为兴奋的事。我们已经把杀害你最亲爱的女儿的凶手于五月八日捉住了。他的名子叫张全宝，是阎匪六十一军七十二师二一五团一营机枪连和第二连的指导员。胡兰同志，就是被这个匪徒与匪军连长徐得胜所杀害的，而且他是主犯。根据现在的真实了解，“大胡子”就是他。但现在他已将胡子剃了。过去我们都曾以为把他打死了，谁料想他仍然活着。不过，敌人不论如何狡猾，终于逃不出人民的法网。今天在镇压反革命浪潮中，张匪全宝落网了。当我们在报上看到你号召全国母亲为死去的女儿复仇时，激起了我们对敌人的无比愤怒，并决心为刘胡兰同志报仇。果然，今天报仇的日子就到了。现在我们已把他押到监狱里。凡是听到这一消息的人，都高兴地蹦跳欢呼。张匪已将全部事实供认不讳。现在将张匪的供状和像片给你寄去一份，你一看便知。
    此致敬礼
                            万泉县县长王沁声  五月十九日
    （注）稷山事件是一九五○年十一月十九日股匪杜辛酉等在山西稷山县举行反革命武装暴乱的事件。这些匪徒杀死我村干部八人，并杀害我稷山县人民政府财粮科长贾仰谊。稷山人民武装协同公安部队当即把该股匪击溃，军民协力追捕，捕获匪首杜辛酉等以下一百六十二名。匪首杜辛酉等七人已被枪决。
