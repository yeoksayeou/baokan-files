Since the Third Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress passed the "Resolution on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" in February of this year, it has been almost four months. During this period, we have conscientiously implemented this resolution, resolutely and severely suppressed a large number of leading counter-revolutionary criminals, and achieved great victories. We believe that this resolution was timely and correct, and played a great role in promoting our work. Before this meeting, we thought that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Beijing was basically completed, but in fact, the problem was not well resolved. The main problem was that a group of counter-revolutionaries who were extremely unpopular and should have been executed were not executed in a timely manner, and the broad masses were not mobilized to fight against the counter-revolutionaries. After this meeting, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries truly became a broad mass movement of people from all walks of life in the city, and thus more thoroughly struck at the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. In accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries of the Central People's Government, we have adopted a resolute suppression policy for those counter-revolutionaries who should be arrested and must be arrested, and for those counter-revolutionaries who should be executed and must be executed. Only in this way can we thoroughly defeat the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries, satisfy the demands of the people, and further shake and disintegrate the counter-revolutionary camp. The originally hidden counter-revolutionaries had to come out and surrender, those who had not completely confessed demanded to clarify again, and some counter-revolutionaries, although unwilling to repent, had to temporarily stop their activities. During this period, we also seized more than 100 guns and many reactionary documents, as well as hidden radio stations. The broad masses of the people, because they have completely overthrown the counter-revolutionaries who have long oppressed, exploited and persecuted them, expressed their warm support and regarded the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "another liberation." After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the people's awareness, enthusiasm and initiative in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries have been unprecedentedly improved, and the relationship between the people and the government has become closer. Therefore, we believe that the resolute and severe suppression of counter-revolutionary measures is not only completely correct, but also very necessary. It is a central link in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguarding the interests of the people of the capital and the development of production and construction.

Our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Beijing Municipality has had shortcomings and errors in the past, such as insufficient打击(dǎjī) against counter-revolutionaries and excessive leniency, but there have been no wrong arrests or wrong killings. In this regard, we have always been prudent and accurate. Since the Third Session of the People's Congress, the scale of our work to suppress counter-revolutionaries has become larger and the firepower has become fiercer; but we are still doing it steadily and accurately, without any deviations and errors. What is the reason? What is the experience? In general, there are the following three points:

First, we concentrate our efforts on打击(dǎjī)ing those leading counter-revolutionary criminals who are extremely sinful, incorrigible, and deeply resented by the people. For such counter-revolutionary elements, we unswervingly adopted a resolute suppression policy; it is absolutely necessary to狠狠地(hěnhěndì)打击(dǎjī) them. Only in this way can we thoroughly打下(dǎxià) the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries, destroy the counter-revolutionary organizations, and completely eliminate the possibility of counter-revolutionaries endangering the country and the people. At the same time, we 狠狠地(hěnhěndì)打击(dǎjī) these counter-revolutionary elements, because there is a standard for punishing counter-revolutionaries and the hatred of the people, and there is also their criminal evidence as the basis for sentencing, so this guarantees that there will be no deviations and errors.

Second, we followed the mass line, let go of the masses, made great fanfare, and carried out extensive publicity, so that every household knew it and everyone understood it. In this way, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has become a joint action of the people and the government, and it can be supervised and supported by the people, overcoming the closed-doorism and mysticism in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Because the masses were mobilized, the counter-revolutionary elements whose crimes were heinous and hated by the masses could not hide, which facilitated the elimination of counter-revolutionaries. It is an extremely important condition that we can eliminate a large number of counter-revolutionaries in a short period of time without making mistakes by letting go of mobilizing the masses.

Third, it is because the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is led, especially by Chairman Mao himself. The public security organs of Beijing Municipality are also experienced and prepared for this work. They have conducted investigations and research on the organizations and crimes of counter-revolutionaries in advance, and obtained materials and evidence. Moreover, in the process of work, they always maintain a clear head. All of this has become a necessary guarantee that there will be no deviations and errors.

What else should be done in the future? We should continue to fight against counter-revolutionaries in the future. This is because the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in Beijing Municipality and the large number of counter-revolutionaries hated by the people have been largely eliminated by us, but they have not been completely eliminated. According to the requirements of the people, some of the counter-revolutionaries who have been arrested still need to be resolutely and quickly executed. Therefore, we should do the following work well in the future:

First, pay close attention to the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of revenge that are still hidden: Most of the counter-revolutionary elements we have打击(dǎjī)ed in this suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement are those who have been exposed; as for the hidden counter-revolutionary elements, although some have been discovered, they have not been severely打击(dǎjī)ed. They are becoming more and more hidden and are looking for opportunities to retaliate. Recently, there was a poisoning incident in Taihe Village in the southern suburbs of Beijing, in which nine people were poisoned, the fifth police station in Mentougou was set on fire, and an explosion occurred in the fourth police station of the outer fourth sub-bureau, injuring ten people. We must be vigilant, strengthen investigation and research, educate and organize the people's regular anti-espionage work, prevent the arrogance and complacency that may arise after the victory in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so as to thoroughly eliminate the enemy and consolidate the victory we have achieved.

Second, clearing up backlog cases and reforming criminals through labor are also the key tasks to be carried out in the current period. For the large number of criminals who have been arrested and detained, we must concentrate our efforts to clear them up and quickly sentence them according to the severity of their crimes. Among them, a part of those who are extremely sinful and cannot quell the anger of the people if they are not killed must be resolutely killed and executed immediately; the vast majority of the rest should be sentenced to imprisonment and then forced to reform through labor; for some counter-revolutionary elements, although they deserve to be sentenced to death, if the public anger is not great, there is no direct blood debt, and the damage to national interests has not reached the most serious level, we will treat such counter-revolutionary elements differently from the counter-revolutionary elements who are extremely sinful and extremely angry by the people, that is, we will adopt the policy of sentencing them to death, suspending the execution for two years, and forcing them to work to see the effect. The reasons why we do this have been reported at the last enlarged joint meeting of people's representatives at the municipal and district levels, and we have already done so. I think we are doing it completely right. We must not only strictly manage the large number of convicted criminals and prevent problems, but also let them participate in production and learn to work. This is a very big thing, and it requires us to spend a lot of manpower and financial resources and have good organization work to do it well. Reforming criminals through labor is punishment, but also education. Long-term detention and forced labor not only deprives them of the conditions for carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, but also forces them to serve the country's production, not allowing them to eat free food, and enables them to transform their thinking and start anew in long-term labor.

Third, establish security committees: According to Chairman Mao's instructions, we are preparing to establish security committees in various streets, factories, organs, and schools. This is a regular organization for the masses to prevent spies and special agents. Only this organization can consolidate and persist in the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in the struggle against the enemy. At present, each district is conducting key experiments, and after gaining experience, they will be generally established. I hope that you representatives will assist us in doing this well.

Fourth, convene meetings of the families of counter-revolutionary elements, educate them, explain the people's government's policy towards counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate any possible opposition and fear they may have. At present, twelve public security sub-bureaus have convened meetings of the families of counter-revolutionary elements, and the effect is quite good. After education, many family members of counter-revolutionary elements expressed their willingness to stand on the people's position and support the government's measures. Many family members of counter-revolutionary elements have said that these counter-revolutionary elements not only oppressed the people in the past, but also oppressed their relatives. The people's government only punishes the counter-revolutionary himself, and does not implicate his family members who have not actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities. As long as they stand on the people's position instead of the counter-revolutionary position, the government and the people will not discriminate against them, and will be leniently dealt with. The property of counter-revolutionary elements must be confiscated, but enough must be left to maintain the livelihood of their family members; the poor can be exempted from confiscation to show the government's leniency. The education of the family members of counter-revolutionary elements is only the beginning, and it will continue to be done in the future.

I hope that the representatives will correct any deficiencies in the above report.

　　在北京市第三届第二次人民代表会议上
    罗瑞卿局长关于镇压反革命工作的报告
    自从今年二月北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议上通过了“关于镇压反革命的决议”以后，到现在已将近四个月了。在此期间，我们认真地执行了这个决议，坚决地严厉地镇压了大批的反革命首恶分子，取得了很大的胜利。我们认为这个决议是适时的、正确的，对我们的工作起了很大的推动作用。在这次会议以前，我们以为北京的镇压反革命工作大体差不多了，但实际上并没有很好的解决问题，主要是一批民愤极大应当处决的反革命分子，没有及时处决，没有发动广大的群众起来同反革命作斗争。在这次会议以后，镇压反革命的工作，才真正形成为全市各阶层人民广大的群众运动，因而也才更为彻底地打击了反革命残余势力。依据中央人民政府的惩治反革命条例，对于那些应该逮捕、必须逮捕的反革命分子，对于那些应该处决、必须处决的反革命分子，我们采取了坚决镇压的方针，这样才彻底地打下了反革命的气焰，满足了人民的要求，从而使反革命阵营内部进一步地发生了动摇分化，原来隐藏的反革命不得不出来自首了，没有完全坦白的要求重新交待清楚了，有些反革命虽然尚不愿悔改，但亦不得不暂时停止活动了。这个时期，我们又收缴了一百多枝枪和许多反动证件以及隐藏的电台。广大人民群众，则由于彻底打倒了长期压迫、剥削和迫害他们的反革命分子，表示热烈地拥护，并把镇压反革命看作是“再一次翻身”。经过镇压反革命与抗美援朝运动后，人民的觉悟、人民同反革命斗争的热情及积极性空前提高了，人民和政府的关系也更加密切了。因此，我们认为：坚决严厉地镇压反革命的措施，不仅是完全应该的，而且是非常必要的，是巩固人民民主专政、保卫首都人民的利益和生产建设事业发展的一个中心环节。
    我们北京市的镇压反革命工作，在过去，曾经有过对反革命打击不够、过于宽大的缺点和错误，但是没有捕错，没有杀错；就这点来说，我们历来就是作得稳当的、准确的。自第三届第一次各界人民代表会议后，我们镇压反革命工作的规模更大了，火力更猛了；但同样我们是作得稳当的、准确的，没有发生偏差和错误。原因何在呢？经验是什么呢？概括讲来，有以下三点：
    第一、我们是集中力量打击那些罪大恶极的、怙恶不悛的、民愤很大的反革命首恶分子，对于这样的反革命分子，我们毫不动摇地采取了坚决镇压的方针；狠狠地打击他们，是完全必要的。只有如此，才能彻底打下反革命的气焰，摧毁反革命的组织，彻底消灭反革命分子危害国家、危害人民的可能。同时，我们狠狠地打击这些反革命分子，因为有了一个惩治反革命条例和人民群众的愤恨作标准，又有他们的罪证作判刑根据，因此，这就保证了不致于发生偏差和错误。
    第二、我们走了群众路线，放手发动了群众，大张旗鼓，进行了广泛的宣传，使家喻户晓，人人明白。这样就把镇压反革命工作变成了人民与政府的共同行动，就能够得到人民群众的监督与支持，克服了镇压反革命工作中的关门主义和神秘主义。因为发动了群众，就使罪大恶极为群众所痛恨的反革命分子隐藏不住了，便利于肃清反革命的工作。使我们能够在短时期内消灭大量反革命分子而没有发生错误，放手发动群众是一个极端重要的条件。
    第三、是由于镇压反革命工作是有领导的，特别是毛主席亲自指导。北京市的公安机关对于这件工作，也是有经验、有准备的，对于反革命的组织和罪行，事先进行了调查研究，取得了材料和证据。而且在工作过程中，随时都保持着清醒的头脑。所有这些，也就成为没有发生偏差和错误的必要保证。
    今后还应当做些什么呢？今后还应当同反革命继续作斗争。这是因为北京市的反革命残余势力，为人民群众所痛恨的大量的反革命分子，虽已大部被我肃清，但还没有彻底肃清；已经逮捕起来的反革命分子，依据人民群众的要求，还有一些须要坚决迅速地处决。因此，我们今后还应该很好地进行以下的工作：
    第一、严密注意至今尚隐藏着的反革命的阴谋报复行为：我们在这次镇压反革命运动中所打击的，大部分是已经暴露了的反革命分子；至于隐藏着的反革命分子，虽然已被发现了些，但还未受到严重打击，他们愈加隐蔽，并伺机报复。最近，北京南郊太和庄就发生九人中毒事件，门头沟第五派出所被人纵火，外四分局第四派出所发生爆炸事件，伤了十人。我们必须提高警惕，加强调查研究，教育并组织人民群众的经常防奸工作，防止在镇压反革命胜利后所产生的骄傲轻敌思想，以便彻底肃清敌人，巩固已得胜利。
    第二、清理积案，劳动改造犯人，也是目前一个时期应当着重进行的工作，对于已经逮捕、关押的大批犯人，必须集中力量，加以清理，依其罪恶轻重迅速判罪。其中，一部罪大恶极，非杀不足以平民愤者，必须坚决杀掉，并迅即执行；其余大部应于判处徒刑后，强迫劳动改造；有一部分反革命分子，虽然罪该处死，但如民愤不大，没有直接血债，损害国家利益尚未达到最严重的程度，我们对于这样的反革命分子的处理，同处理罪大恶极、民愤极大的反革命分子加以若干区别，即采取判处死刑，缓期两年执行，强迫劳动，以观后效的政策。我们这样作的理由，在上次市、区两级各界人民代表扩大联席会议上，已经报告过，而且我们已经这样作了，我想我们是作的完全对的。我们不仅要把大批的判刑罪犯严格地管理好，不发生问题，还要让他们参加生产，学会劳动。这是一个很大的事情，需要我们化费很大的人力财力，并有很好的组织工作，才能做好。劳动改造犯人，对于犯人来说，是惩罚，也是教育。长期地关起来，强迫他们劳动，不仅剥夺了他们进行反革命活动的条件，还要强迫他们为国家生产服务，不让他们吃闲饭，并使他们在长期劳动中思想得到改造，重新做人。
    第三、成立治安保卫委员会：按照毛主席的指示，准备在各街道、工厂、机关、学校成立治安保卫委员会。这是群众进行防奸细、防特务的经常组织。只有这个组织才能把群众的对敌斗争的热情与积极性巩固起来，坚持下去。现在各区都进行重点试验，取得经验后，再普遍成立，希望各位代表协助我们把这件事情办好。
    第四、召开反革命分子的家属会，向他们进行教育，并说明人民政府对待反革命的政策，消除他们可能产生的若干对立、害怕情绪。目前已有十二个公安分局召开了反革命分子的家属会，效果颇好。许多反革命分子的家属经过教育后，表示愿意站在人民立场，拥护政府措施。许多反革命分子的家属都讲这些反革命分子的过去不仅欺压人民，而且欺压他们的亲属。人民政府只惩办反革命本人，而不株连其未积极参与反革命活动的家属。只要他们站在人民立场上，而不是站在反革命立场上，政府和人民都不会歧视他们，且要宽大处理。反革命分子的财产必须没收，但也要留下足够维持其家属生活的部分；贫穷的可免予没收，以示政府的宽大。对反革命分子的家属教育工作，现在还仅是开始，以后还要继续去做。
    以上报告是否有当，希望各位代表指正。
