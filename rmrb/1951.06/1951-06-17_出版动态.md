　　Publication Updates
　　　　《Current Affairs Handbook》No. 16
　　《Current Affairs Handbook》No. 16 mainly focuses on celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the three major appeals of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and the establishment of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, providing some propaganda materials. The article "What Kind of Party is the Chinese Communist Party" gives a basic explanation of the basic nature and ultimate goals of the Chinese Communist Party. The article "Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese Communist Party" points out the glorious victories the Chinese people have achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and the direction of continued efforts in the future. "Statistical Data on the Organizational Development of the Chinese Communist Party" reports to readers the number of party members and other related statistics.
　　　　New Improvements in the Northeast 《Propagandist Handbook》
　　The Northeast Propagandist Handbook has new improvements and has achieved results. Starting from the 20th issue, the publication paid attention to overcoming the shortcomings of the past where the propaganda materials were massive and not concentrated. Each issue now only promotes one or two major current political issues and expresses them in a variety of popular propaganda forms such as blackboards, slides, and ballad singing. For example, starting from the 21st issue, in coordination with the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the Northeast region, the publication conducted systematic and continuous propaganda, from ideological enlightenment, mobilizing secret reports, and denunciations, to calling for the signing of patriotic anti-traitor covenants. Another feature of the publication is that it is popular, specific, and closely linked to reality, with short articles, large fonts, and illustrations. (However, the painting and writing skills need to be further improved.) Currently, the publication has a circulation of 300,000 copies, and the 26th issue, "Special Issue Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party," has a circulation of 1.1 million copies. In the Northeast region with a population of 40 million, there is an average of one propagandist handbook for every forty people.
　　　　《Selected Materials on Kovalev's Working Methods》
　　Promoting advanced work experience is the best way to improve production output and quality. The Soviet Kovalev method has brought the Stakhanov movement to a new stage. This working method has been widely adopted in the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. 《Chinese Industry》New Volume Three, Issue One, 《Selected Materials on Kovalev's Working Methods》, reports on the process and experience of some factories and mines in Northeast China in adopting Kovalev's working methods. From these reports, it can be known that Kovalev's working method is suitable for various industrial sectors. Any industrial and mining enterprise that implements Kovalev's working method will definitely be able to improve in terms of output and quality. For example, the Zhu Shiqing production team, reported in the selection, created 44 new indicators in three months after implementing Kovalev's working method. Another example is a certain assembly plant, which increased its output by eight times after implementing Kovalev's working method. In the upsurge of patriotic production competitions, Kovalev's working method should attract the attention and promotion of industrial and mining enterprises.
　　　　Criticism of Lianhuanhua Published in Northeast China
　　The Northeast has recently published seven lianhuanhua: 《The Big Bad Wolf》, 《The Party's Good Daughter Zhao Guilan》, 《Model Brothers》, 《A Way Out》, 《Glorious Family》, 《Establishing a Party Propaganda Network》, 《Gun》. Northeast Daily published a critique of these books on June 9th by Zhang Wang titled 《Create More and Better Lianhuanhua》, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of these works, and emphasized the ideological shortcomings of the most mature work, 《The Party's Good Daughter Zhao Guilan》. The timely publication of correct criticisms of publications in each region by the local newspapers is of great help in improving the quality of publications. This is worth striving for.
　　　　Translation Bulletin Completes Two Volumes
　　Translation Bulletin Volume Two, Issue Six, was published on the 15th of this month. With this issue, it has completed two volumes and has played a certain role in translation work. Several articles in this issue criticize 《English-Chinese Model Dictionary》, 《Comprehensive English-Chinese Dictionary》, and Qiu Zhengang's translation of 《Russian Idiom Dictionary》(Shanghai Zhenxian Bookstore, February 1951 First Edition). In the preface to the article 《Review of Qiu's Translation of〈Russian Idiom Dictionary〉》, the editor pointed out: "This dictionary is full of errors, and the adverse impact on readers is incalculable. This irresponsible and shoddy style of work deserves the vigilance of translators and publishers across the country."
　　The National Translation Work Conference is about to be held. In preparation for formulating a relatively long-term national translation plan, 《Translation Bulletin》published a notice from the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the General Administration of Publications soliciting opinions on translations of Marxist-Leninist classics, hoping that readers across the country will provide opinions on some issues related to translations of relevant classics based on their usual study experiences.

　　出版动态
            《时事手册》第十六期
    《时事手册》第十六期主要以庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年、中国人民抗美援朝总会的三大号召和和平解放西藏协议成立为中心，提供了若干宣传资料。《中国共产党是怎样的党》一文，就中国共产党的基本性质和最终目的作了基本的说明。《庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年》一文，指出中国人民在共产党领导之下已获得的光辉胜利和今后继续努力的方向。《关于中国共产党组织发展的统计资料》，向读者报告了党员数目和其他有关统计。
            东北《宣传员手册》的新改进
    东北宣传员手册，有了新的改进，并获得成绩。该刊从二十期起，注意克服过去宣传材料庞杂不集中的缺点，每期只宣传一两个重大的时事政治问题，并用黑板报，幻灯，鼓词等多种通俗的宣传形式表现出来。如从二十一期起，配合东北地区的大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，从思想启发，发动密告，检举，到号召订立爱国反奸公约，进行了有系统地连续宣传。该刊另一特点是，做到了通俗具体，联系实际，文章简短，字大并加插画。（但绘画及文字的表现技术都要继续改进）现该刊发行数量已达三十万份，第二十六期的《庆祝中国共产党三十周年专号》发行数量达一百一十万份，在东北区四千万人口中，平均四十人中有一本宣传员手册。
            《郭瓦略夫工作方法资料选辑》
    推广先进的工作经验，是提高生产品产量、质量的最好方法。苏联的郭瓦略夫工作法，使斯塔哈诺夫运动达到了一个新的阶段。这个工作方法已经在苏联和东欧各新民主主义国家广泛采用。《中国工业》新三卷第一期中的《郭瓦略夫工作方法资料选辑》，报道了我国东北某些厂矿采用郭瓦略夫工作方法的经过和经验。从这些报道里，可以知道郭瓦略夫的工作方法是适合各种工业部门的。凡是实行了郭瓦略夫工作方法的工矿企业，就一定能在产量和质量上提高。如选辑中所报道的朱世清生产小组，在实行郭瓦略夫工作法后，在三个月中创造了四十四种新指标。又如某装配厂，在实行郭瓦略夫的工作方法后，使产量提高了八倍。在爱国主义生产竞赛热潮中，郭瓦略夫的工作方法是应当引起工矿企业的注意和推广的。
            对东北出版的连环图画的批评
    东北在最近已经出版了七种连环画：《大灰狼》、《党的好女儿赵桂兰》、《模范兄弟》、《活路》、《光荣人家》、《建立党的宣传网》、《枪》。东北日报对这些书在六月九日发表了张望作《创作更多更好的连环图画》的批评，指出了这些作品的优缺点，并将其中制作最成熟的《党的好女儿赵桂兰》思想性的缺点作了强调的说明。各地区的报纸对各该区域的出版物及时地发表正确的批评，对出版物品质的提高有很大帮助。这是值得努力的。
            翻译通报出满两卷
    翻译通报二卷六期已于本月十五日出版。到本期为止，它已出满两卷，在翻译工作中起了一定的作用。本期有几篇文章对《英汉模范字典》、《综合英汉大辞典》和裘振刚译《俄文成语辞典》（上海振先书屋一九五一年二月初版）提出批评。在《评裘译〈俄文成语辞典〉》一文的前记中，编者指出：“这部辞典错误百出，对读者的恶劣影响，是难以估计的。这种对人民不负责任，粗制滥造的坏作风，值得全国翻译工作者和出版家加以警惕。”
    全国翻译工作会议行将召开，为准备制订比较长期的全国翻译计划，《翻译通报》本期刊出了出版总署编译局征求对马列主义经典著作译本意见的启事，希望全国读者就平时学习心得对有关经典著作译本的一些问题提出意见。
