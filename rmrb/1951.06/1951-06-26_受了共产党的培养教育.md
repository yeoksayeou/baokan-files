Received the Communist Party's Cultivation and Education
To the editor of the workers' newspaper:
    The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party is approaching. When I think of "July 1st," I can't help but think of the suffering I endured in the past under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Comparing the past with today, I feel indescribably happy.

    When I was young, my family had only two and a half earthen houses and five fen of graveyard, relying on my father's work to make a living. When I was fourteen, I started crushing stones at a factory. After only twenty-one days of work, the factory reduced staff, and our group was laid off. This time, we did odd jobs for the landowners in the village. When there was no work in the village, my whole family had to go to the coke piles to pick coke cinders and sweep coal. At that time, eating cornmeal was considered good food; sometimes, when we had little money, we would buy some bran and mix it with a large amount of tree leaves and wild vegetables. If it happened to be a cloudy or rainy day, we would have to go hungry. When I was seventeen, the Qixin Cement Plant happened to be adding new workers. I asked someone to put in a good word for me, and I was finally able to enter this door. At that time, wages were low, and prices were constantly rising. The wages I received could only buy a few kilograms of cornmeal after paying for "conscription fees" and "bao-jia fees"; it was truly a case of not having enough to eat or burn.

    On December 12, 1948, the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army came to Tangshan. First, they stabilized prices, abolished the unreasonable contracting system, led the workers to establish their own trade union, established a worker consumer cooperative, and gradually improved the lives of the workers. From then on, we Tangshan workers were liberated. In the autumn of 1949, I heard that the third term of the Tangshan Workers' School was about to start. When I heard this news, I was so happy that I couldn't even eat my meal properly that day. I signed up for the study. After graduating and returning to the factory, I actively participated in various trade union activities and became a group leader. Sometimes I was so busy with meetings that I didn't have time to eat. Although I was busy with production, meetings, and studies all day long, I never felt tired, and I only felt happy in my heart.

    Since last winter, I have been transferred to the factory's workers' newspaper office to work as a newspaper editor. Looking back, this is something I never dreamed of before! I know that this is the glory brought to me by the Communist Party and the glory brought to me by Chairman Mao. It makes me deeply realize that only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we have today's good life, and I can have today's happiness. This is something I will never forget!

    Although in these two years, under the leadership and education of the Communist Party, I have made progress in politics, life, and culture, I am not satisfied with this. In order to commemorate the Party's birthday, and in order to respond to the call of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and maintain the eternal happiness of the next generation of children, I will work hard under the banner of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to strive for a better life in the future.

    受了共产党的培养教育
    我当了工人报纸的编辑编辑同志：
    中国共产党成立三十周年的纪念日快要到了。我想起“七一”，就连想起了过去，在蒋匪国民党统治时期所受的痛苦。拿过去和今天来比，心里有说不出的高兴。
    我小的时候，家里只有两间半土房，有五分坟地，依靠我父亲做工维持生活。我十四岁那年，开始给工厂砸石碴。刚做了二十一天的工，厂里减人，我们那班人就被减下来了。这回就在庄里，给有地的庄户人家做短工。庄里没有活的时候，我们一家子就只好到焦子堆上，去拣焦碴、扫煤。当时吃玉米面就算好粮食；有时钱少，就买点糠，搀上一大部分树叶和野菜。要是赶上个阴天下雨的，就得挨饿。我十七岁的时候，正赶上启新洋灰栈添新工人。我托人求情，才进去这个门。在那时候，工钱少，物价又不断上涨，领下的工钱除了化“壮丁费”、“保甲费”外，还只能是买几斤玉米面；真是要吃没吃，要烧没烧的。
    一九四八年十二月十二日，共产党、解放军来到了唐山。首先稳定了物价，取消了不合理的包工大柜，领导着职工成立了自己的工会，建立了职工消费合作社，逐步地改善了工人生活。从此，我们唐山工人翻了身。在一九四九年的秋后，听说唐山职工学校第三期快开学了。在我听到这个消息的时候，欢喜的当天连饭都没吃好。我报名参加学习了。毕业回厂后，积极参加工会的各种活动，当了组长。有时候开会忙得顾不得吃饭。虽然整天忙着生产、开会、学习，我从来不觉着累，心里光觉着痛快。
    从去年冬天起，我就被调到本厂工人报社，当了报纸的编辑。回想起来，这是我从前做梦也想不到的事！我知道，这是共产党给我带来的光荣，毛主席给我带来的光荣。使我深深地体会到，只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，才能有今天的好日子，我才会有今天的幸福，这是我永远不会忘记的！
    虽说这二年，在共产党的领导和教育下，使我在政治上生活上文化上都有了进步，但是我并不以此为满足。为了纪念党的生日，为了响应抗美援朝总会的号召，保持下一代孩子们永远的幸福，我要在共产党和毛主席的旗帜下，为争取将来更美好的生活而努力工作。
