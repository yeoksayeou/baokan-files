　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: TASS Moscow reported: Izvestia published a commentary on the 2nd by commentator Furlongsky, commenting on the Chinese agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, saying: American and British imperialists attempted to separate Tibet from China, making it a springboard for new actions to invade the People's Republic of China and oppose the national liberation movement of Asian peoples. However, this attempt did not achieve the expected results. The Tibetan people eagerly hope to return to the big family of all ethnic groups in China enjoying equal rights. The agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet is a brilliant victory for the unity of the Chinese people and another failure for American and British imperialists.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Polish Press Agency Warsaw reported: The Polish "Free Tribune" published a paper on May 31st entitled "A New Era for Tibet," commenting on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, saying: The agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed in Beijing is a successful example of a national policy that respects the customs and religious beliefs of minority ethnic groups for countries fighting for freedom. The peaceful liberation of Tibet eliminated another base for imperialist conspiracy activities, thereby strengthening the forces defending peace. The disappointment shown by Washington and London upon receiving news of the agreement shows how seriously the peaceful liberation of Tibet has struck the conspiracy of the warmongers.

　　和平解放西藏办法获得协议是美英帝国主义的又一失败         
    苏波报纸发表评论指出
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二日消息报发表评论员佛隆斯基的文章，评论中国关于和平解放西藏办法的协议说：美英帝国主义者曾企图把西藏从中国分割出去，使它成为侵略中华人民共和国和反对亚洲民族解放运动的新行动的跳板。但是这种企图并未达到预期的结果，西藏人民热望回到享有平等权利的中国各族人民的大家庭来。关于和平解放西藏办法的协议是中国人民团结的辉煌胜利，也是美英帝国主义者的又一次失败。
    【新华社三日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰《自由论坛报》于五月三十一日发表题为《西藏的新时代》的论文，评论西藏的和平解放说：在北京签订的和平解放西藏办法的协议，对于为自由而斗争的国家来说，是尊重少数民族风俗习惯及宗教信仰的民族政策的成功范例，西藏的和平解放消灭了帝国主义的另一个阴谋活动的基地，因而加强了保卫和平的力量。华盛顿和伦敦方面在接到协议的消息时所表现的失望，显示了西藏的和平解放如何严重地打击了战争贩子的阴谋。
