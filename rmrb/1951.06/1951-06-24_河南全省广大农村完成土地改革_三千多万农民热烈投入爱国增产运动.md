　　Land Reform Completed in Vast Rural Areas of Henan Province
    Over 30 Million Peasants Enthusiastically Join Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    By the beginning of June this year, land reform had been fully implemented in the vast rural areas of Henan Province, with a population of over 32 million, except for 140 townships in the Huai River flood-stricken area.
    Henan Province began implementing land reform in the autumn of 1949. The land reform in the province was carried out in three phases: Xiangcheng, Linru, Baofeng, Yexian and other eleven counties were the first phase, and their land reform was largely completed before the Spring Festival last year. Chenliu, Kaifeng, Zheng County, Xuchang, Xiping, Suiping, Nanyang and other thirty-three counties were the second phase, and were also largely completed before the wheat harvest last year. The remaining forty-three counties and the suburbs of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other five cities were the third phase, which was implemented last winter and this spring, and just ended before the wheat harvest this year. In the areas where land reform was largely completed last year, namely the forty-four counties in the first and second phases, the peasant masses were universally mobilized again last winter and this spring to carefully handle the remaining issues of land reform, and land certificates were issued by the People's Government. Now, in all 87 counties and more than 13,000 townships in the province, except for 140 townships distributed along the banks of the Huai River and its tributaries, which have not yet implemented land reform due to the tense flood control work or the severe floods they suffered last year, land reform has been fully completed.
    During the land reform in the province, a total of more than 18.9 million mu of cultivated land was confiscated and requisitioned according to law; land was distributed to landless and land-poor peasants, who accounted for 60 percent of the province's rural population. Some received as much as five mu per person, others as little as two mu, but the average was about three mu. In addition, the province confiscated a total of more than 3,346,000 head of draught animals, more than 4,600,000 pieces of farm tools, and more than 311.1 million jin of surplus grain according to law. More peasants benefited from the distribution of these means of production than from the distribution of cultivated land, accounting for more than 70 percent of the province's rural population. In this land reform, 7,930,000 poor peasants who used to live in shacks or dilapidated temples were given more than 2,260,000 houses.
    Before the land reform, the rural areas of Henan counties had undergone movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing despots, and reducing rent, which severely打击[dǎ jī, to strike; to hit; to attack] the feudal ruling forces in the countryside, especially bandits and despots. However, because peasants could not gain complete political advantage before land reform, there were still many resistance and sabotage activities by lawless landlords before and during the land reform movement in various parts of Henan. In the counties of Luoyang Prefecture, 60 percent of the villages had landlords resisting the payment of rent and reclaiming land from tenants before the land reform. Thus, when launching the land reform movement in various parts of Henan, the peasants were first mobilized to review rent reduction and further oppose despots in order to crush the reactionary arrogance of lawless landlords. During the movement, a total of 87 county people's courts and 480 branch courts were established in the province to handle 7,811 cases related to land reform, severely suppressing the heinous despotic landlords and counter-revolutionaries, and ensuring the smooth progress of the movement. At the same time, under the leadership of the peasant associations, the peasants of the province carried out fierce reasoning struggles against the landlord class, which thoroughly crushed all resistance and sabotage by lawless landlords and achieved a complete victory in the land reform of the province.
    Now, the strength of the peasants in the rural areas of Henan Province is powerful. Members of peasant associations account for 30 to 40 percent of the rural population, plus the peasant masses united around the peasant associations, accounting for about 80 percent of the rural population. The existence of such a force guarantees the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside. Up to now, among the more than 13,000 townships in Henan Province, more than 10,700 townships have established democratically elected township people's governments, and more than 100,000 mass leaders and activists of the peasant movement have been elected as cadres of rural governments. In Xuchang Prefecture, Zhengzhou Prefecture, and Luoyang Prefecture, where land reform was completed earlier, the heads of 47 district people's governments were promoted from local peasant activists. The consciousness of the peasants throughout the province has been raised, and they are enthusiastically carrying out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In May this year, more than 19 million peasants in the province participated in demonstrations to oppose the United States' arming of Japan and defend world peace. In the past two months alone, the militia of Huangchuan, Gushi, Luoshan and other counties have assisted the government in arresting 917 counter-revolutionaries.
    Before liberation, the peasants of Henan suffered deeply. At that time, under the rule of the Kuomintang government, landlords, and bandits in Henan's rural areas, they suffered from water, drought, locusts, bandits, and other disasters year after year, and millions of peasants were bankrupted and displaced. Before and after the land reform, countless displaced peasants returned to their hometowns to share land and rebuild their homes, and the desolate Yellow River flood area is recovering its former prosperity. Now, with the completion of land reform, more than 30 million peasants throughout the province are enthusiastically engaged in the patriotic production increase movement and building a new Henan.

### 河南全省广大农村完成土地改革  三千多万农民热烈投入爱国增产运动

　　河南全省广大农村完成土地改革
    三千多万农民热烈投入爱国增产运动
    河南全省三千二百多万人口的广大农村，到今年六月初为止，除淮河水灾区的一百四十个乡外，已经全部实行了土地改革。
    河南省实行土地改革是从一九四九年秋天开始的。全省土地改革分三批进行：襄城、临汝、宝丰、叶县等十一个县是第一批，这些县的土地改革在去年春节前就大体上完成了。陈留、开封、郑县、许昌、西平、遂平、南阳等三十三县是第二批，在去年麦收前也大体上完成了。另外四十三个县和开封、郑州等五个市的郊区是第三批，去冬今春才实行土地改革，今年麦收以前刚刚结束。去年大体完成了土地改革的地区，即第一批和第二批的四十四个县，去冬今春又普遍发动农民群众，慎重地处理了土地改革的遗留问题，并由人民政府颁发了土地证。现在，全省八十七个县，一万三千多个乡，除了分布在淮河干支流沿岸的一百四十个乡，或因治淮工作紧张，或因去年遭受水灾很重，还没有实行土地改革以外，都已全部完成了土地改革。
    全省土地改革中，依法没收和征收的耕地共计是一千八百九十多万亩；占全省农村人口百分之六十的无地少地农民都分得了耕地。多的每人分到五亩，少的分到二亩，普通是分到三亩左右。此外，全省依法没收的耕畜共计是三百三十四万六千多头，农具是四百六十多万件，多余粮食是三亿一千一百多万斤。分得这些生产资料的农民比分得耕地的多些，占全省农村人口的百分之七十以上。过去蹲在草棚里或破庙中过日子的七百九十三万贫苦农民，在这次土地改革中，分得了二百二十六万多间房子。
    河南各县农村，在土地改革以前，都曾经过清剿土匪、反恶霸和减租等运动，沉重地打击过农村中的封建统治势力，特别是土匪和恶霸。但是，因为土地改革前农民不可能取得政治上的完全的优势，所以，河南各地土地改革运动前和运动中，不法地主的抵抗破坏活动仍然很多。洛阳专区各县百分之六十的乡村，在土地改革前都曾发现有地主抗交退租粮食和夺佃的现象。这样，河南各地在发动土地改革运动的时候，曾先发动农民复查减租进一步反恶霸入手，来打垮不法地主的反动气焰。在运动中，全省共建立了八十七个县人民法庭和四百八十个分庭，处理了七千八百十一起与土地改革有关的案件，严厉地镇压了罪大恶极的恶霸地主和反革命分子，保证了运动的顺利进展。同时，全省农民在农民协会领导下，对地主阶级进行了激烈的说理斗争，才彻底粉碎了不法地主的一切抵抗和破坏，取得了全省土地改革的完全胜利。
    现在，河南全省农村中，农民的力量是强大的。农民协会的会员占农村人口的百分之三十到百分之四十，加上团结在农民协会周围的农民群众，共占农村人口的百分之八十左右。这样一个力量的存在，就保证了农村中的人民民主专政。到目前为止，河南全省一万三千多个乡中，已经有一万零七百多个乡建立了民选的乡人民政府，有十万以上的农民运动的群众领袖和积极分子当选为乡村政权的干部。土地改革完成较早的许昌专区、郑州专区和洛阳专区各县，有四十七个区人民政府的区长，是从当地的农民积极分子中提拔起来的。全省农民的觉悟都提高了，他们正热烈地开展着抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动。今年五月，为反对美国武装日本和保卫世界和平，全省农民参加示威游行的达一千九百多万人。最近两个月，仅潢川、固始、罗山等县的民兵，就协助政府逮捕了九百十七名反革命分子。
    解放以前，河南农民灾难深重。当时，河南农村在国民党政府、地主、土匪三位一体的统治下，历年遭受水、旱、蝗、匪等灾，农民破产流亡的达数百万人。土地改革前后，无数流亡的农民还乡分地，重建家园，荒凉的黄泛区正恢复昔日的繁荣。现在，土地改革完成了，全省三千多万农民都热情蓬勃地投入了爱国增产运动，建设新河南。
