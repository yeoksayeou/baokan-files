              They Are Not Orphans
    The Soviet government has allocated huge sums of money to support orphans from the Great Patriotic War. The Russian Federation alone has allocated more than three billion rubles. Thousands of children's homes have been opened throughout the country, where children who lost their parents during the war live and study. These children have found new families among their peers and teachers; they are not orphans.
            Prisons Cannot Intimidate the Japanese People
    In April, Japanese police arrested sixteen students from Tokyo University for publicly opposing the arming of Japan and supporting the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. These students were subjected to torture and handed over to the US military tribunal for trial. Japanese democratic public opinion protested strongly, demanding their immediate release.
    Opposition to Japan's rearmament is the unanimous wish of all honest Japanese people. Can the US-Japanese reactionaries imprison more than eighty million Japanese people?
            De Gaulle and Pétain
    The French reactionary ringleader De Gaulle is currently campaigning in France and North Africa. In places he has visited, such as Aran, Algiers, and Constantine, despite heavy police security, people everywhere have held demonstrations to protest De Gaulle's arrival. In his speeches, De Gaulle even advocated for the release of Pétain. The people of France and its colonies, on the other hand, advocate that this war criminal and that old traitor be locked up together.
            Who Are the Enslaved?
    Members of a British workers' delegation who attended the May Day celebrations in the Soviet Union gave speeches at a conference in London, discussing their impressions of their visit to the Soviet Union. All representatives emphasized the Soviet people's sincere desire for peace, the peaceful construction in the Soviet Union, and the freedom in all aspects of social and cultural life.
    McCulloch, a member of the National Union of Railway Workers of Great Britain, said: "Sullivan, a lead pipe worker from Liverpool, said when he flew to the Soviet Union: 'The Russians are all slaves,' but a week later, he believed 'we are the slaves, not the Russians.'"
