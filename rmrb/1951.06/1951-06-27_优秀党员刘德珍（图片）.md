After Liu Dezhen discovered this problem, he proactively suggested that the Party, the administration, and the trade union organize joint meetings among the workers, which solved the technical and work-related problems, and also resolved the issue of unity.
    (5) At the same time, Liu Dezhen correctly implemented the Party's policy of uniting technical personnel, often humbly asking engineer Yu Yunhai for technical theory, while also promoting the Party's policies to Yu Yunhai and caring for Yu Yunhai's life, which brought Engineer Yu closer to the Party and also ensured the successful completion of the repair project.
