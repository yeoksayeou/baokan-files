Plains and Shandong Yellow River embankment protection personnel used drilling methods to inspect the Yellow River levee this year, eliminating many leaks and consolidating the embankment. In Pingyuan Province alone, the Yellow River embankment protection personnel in Yuanyang and Fengqiu discovered more than a thousand leaks of all sizes on the Yellow River levee. In Chenqiao and Caogang in Fengqiu County, a particularly large hole was discovered on the Yellow River levee in each location. If these holes had not been discovered and plugged in time, they could have leaked and caused a breach in the future, which would have been very dangerous. Cadres and the masses in these areas have become vigilant and actively inspect the Yellow River levee.

The tool for drilling the river embankment is a round steel bar about three to four meters long. The ends of the steel bar are made into square pointed tips, and there is a wooden handle in the middle. When in use, the wooden handle is twisted and pressed down with force, and the probe gradually drills into the embankment body. If a large hole is encountered during drilling, the probe plunges down, and the person drilling will feel a vibration. This allows for the discovery of leaks and also allows for measuring the size of the hole and finding its direction. This method of drilling and inspecting the river embankment is very efficient when carried out in an organized manner, with an average person able to inspect one li of the river embankment per day.

### 平原山东黄河护堤人员  用探钻方法检查黄河大堤  消灭许多漏洞巩固了堤防

    消灭许多漏洞巩固了堤防
    平原、山东两省今年采用探钻方法检查黄河大堤，消灭了许多漏洞，巩固了堤防。平原省仅原阳和封邱的黄河护堤人员，就在黄河大堤上发现了大大小小一千多个漏洞。封邱县陈桥和曹岗两个地方，在黄河堤上各发现了一个特别大的洞。这些洞如果不是及时发现并把它们堵住，将来就可能漏水决口，危险很大。这些地方的干部和群众都警觉起来，积极检查黄河大堤。
    探钻河堤的工具，是一根长约三、四公尺的圆形钢条。钢条两端打成四楞尖头，中间有木柄。用时扭动木柄，用力下按，探条就渐渐钻进堤身。探钻中间如遇大洞，探条猛下，探钻的人会感到震动。这样就可发现漏洞，还能测出洞的大小，找到洞的方向。这种探钻检查河堤的方法，有组织地进行时效率很高，平均一个人一天可以检查一里长的河堤。
