Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 26th. The movement of the people of the motherland to enthusiastically donate airplanes, cannons, tanks, and provide preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers has powerfully inspired the fighting enthusiasm of all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. When many donation messages reached a certain unit that had recently won a victory in the counterattack at the Chaoyang River front, the unit immediately mimeographed them and sent them to the front lines. The soldiers quickly circulated them, reading them aloud. Some cultural instructors used megaphones to broadcast on the front lines. Shandong soldiers, upon hearing that Shandong Province was preparing to donate an air force division's worth of airplanes, cheered with joy, boasting, "See! It's still the old liberated area, donating a whole air force division!" The soldiers became more and more excited as they talked, pointing at the American planes circling in the sky and saying, "When the planes donated by our people are deployed, see if you dare to be so arrogant!" Cui Jianguo, a combat hero who had killed more than twenty American soldiers and captured eight, said, "The American soldiers have airplanes, cannons, and tanks, but we defeated them with light weapons; in the future, we will also have airplanes, tanks, and more cannons, plus everyone's efforts, we will definitely make the enemy fail even more miserably!" The artillerymen of the Volunteer Army were also excitedly discussing. Artilleryman Liu Fengbing said, "We must improve our skills and win more victories to welcome the 'Volunteer Cannons' donated by the people of the motherland." Many units and soldiers also wrote letters to the people of the motherland to express their gratitude. In his letter, soldier Yang Lianfang wrote: "Dear fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of the motherland: You care about us every day, sending us comfort bags and letters of sympathy, supporting us in every way. Now you are increasing production and donating money to buy us airplanes, cannons, and tanks, and taking care of our families. We are on the front line, and we must respond to your enthusiastic support with practical actions of winning more victories and eliminating more enemies until the final liberation of all of Korea."

　　祖国人民热烈捐献飞机大炮
    鼓舞了志愿军战斗热情
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】祖国人民热烈捐献飞机、大炮、坦克和优待革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的运动，有力地鼓舞了志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员们的战斗热情。当许多捐献消息传到最近在照阳江前线反击战中取得胜利的某部时，该部立即把它油印出来，送到阵地上去。战士们飞快地互相传阅，高声朗读。有的文化教员就在阵地上用喇叭筒进行广播。山东籍的战士们听到了山东全省准备捐献一个空军师的飞机，个个高兴得欢呼起来，并且夸耀说：“看！到底是老解放区，一捐就是一个空军师！”战士们越谈越高兴，指着在空中盘旋的美国飞机说：“等我们祖国人民捐献的飞机一出动，看你还敢逞凶！”曾经杀伤美军二十余名，俘虏美军八名的战斗英雄崔建国说：“美国兵有飞机、大炮、坦克，我们拿着轻武器就打败了它；今后我们也有了飞机、坦克和更多的大炮，加上大家的努力，一定叫敌人失败得更惨！”志愿军的炮兵们也在兴奋地谈论着。炮手刘凤秉说：“我们要提高技术，多打胜仗，迎接祖国人民捐献的‘志愿炮’。”许多单位和战士还写信给祖国人民表示感谢。战士杨连芳的信上写着：“亲爱的祖国父老兄弟姐妹们：你们整天关心着我们，给我们送慰问袋，写慰问信，从各方面来支援我们。现在你们又增加生产，捐出钱来给我们买飞机、大炮与坦克，还照顾我们的家属。我们在前线，一定要用多打胜仗，消灭更多的敌人，直到最后解放全朝鲜的实际行动，来回答你们热情的支援。”
