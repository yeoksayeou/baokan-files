    Thank Chairman Mao, Thank the Communist Party!
    Fu Xuewen, Forgeman, Beijing Machine Factory

    As the Chinese Communist Party's birthday – "July 1st" – is fast approaching, I want to say what’s in my heart. I thank Chairman Mao, I thank the Communist Party. I want to publicize the benefits of the Communist Party, and learn from the Communist Party. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I would never have the happy life I have now.

    In the past, my family was so poor that we had nothing. Since I was little, I followed my father in tilling the land for landlords. All the grain we harvested was handed over to the landlord. Later, when we encountered famine years and my family was on the verge of starvation, I ran to Beijing and asked someone to introduce me to a metal factory as a porter. I worked for more than three years, suffering nothing but abuse from the Japanese devils. I was beaten and scolded, treated like an animal. The suffering I endured is beyond words.

    I finally looked forward to the Japanese devils surrendering, but who knew the Kuomintang reactionaries would come again. The Kuomintang reactionaries were single-mindedly against the people, launching civil wars and causing prices to skyrocket. At that time, the money I earned in a day wasn't enough for my family of four to eat one meal of cornmeal. My wife had to sew and wash clothes for others every day to earn a little money to feed us. At that time, I lived in a factory house. A few days after my wife gave birth, the factory forced us to vacate the house because they were adding a new employee. They just didn't treat workers as human beings, and didn't care if you were having a baby!

    I had a fellow villager who worked as a farmhand for landlords. Once, he came to my house. He saw that my family was dressed in rags and barely had enough to eat, so he advised me to go back to the countryside. I listened to him and took my wife and children back to the countryside to work for a landlord. I worked for eight months and earned six bags of old corn. After I finished work, the grain at home was also gone. At this time, the Kuomintang was grabbing soldiers everywhere, so I hid in the reed pond behind our house. It was the dead of winter, and I hid in the reed pond for three days and three nights, but in the end, I was seen by a bad person in the village. The puppet Baozhang arrested me and sent me to the Qinghe Town puppet police station, not far from Beijing, and detained me. Just at this time, the People's Liberation Army came. Many of the strong men detained by the puppet police station were liberated.

    After liberation, a year later, I returned to the factory and became a forgeman. Not long after, land reform was implemented in my hometown, and my family was allocated ten mu of paddy fields, three and a half rooms, and waterwheels and miscellaneous farm tools. Since then, my life has been getting better day by day. In the past, we couldn't afford corn buns, but now we eat steamed buns every day. In the past, my family was dressed in rags, but now we have all changed into new clothes. In the past, we couldn't even take care of our own lives, but now we have savings every month. I also bought a bicycle, so I don't have to run to and from work anymore. The land at home is mainly cultivated by my wife, and I help her every Sunday. Last autumn harvest, I also bought a new rice threshing machine. Last year's harvest was good, and this year we have everything. There is also enough fertilizer in the fields. This year's harvest may be even better than last year's.

    If the Communist Party hadn't come, could I have such a good life? If the Kuomintang reactionaries hadn't been driven away and our own people's government established, could my family have been allocated land and could I be working so steadily?

    Just take our village as an example. Before liberation, the village offices all worked for the landlords, bullying the poor. You couldn't find them for good things, but you couldn't escape grain requisitions, forced labor, and corvée. The current village government is completely different from before. They discuss everything with everyone in meetings, and they always speak to us kindly.

    Speaking of the factory. Before liberation, the bosses would glare at you when they spoke, and they would curse you at every turn, and beat you at the slightest provocation. Now, the foreman always patiently teaches you how to do things when you are working, discusses things with you, and helps you solve various difficulties. If it were before liberation, you would never even think of these things.

    In particular, the Communist Party members who work with me in the factory, they always rush to do the work. Take Comrade Yan Cunyi of our forging department, for example. His job is to operate the air hammer. When he operates the air hammer, he always tells everyone to be careful, not to get hit. He gives you ideas for everything you do. If someone is sick, he rushes to the clinic to ask the doctor to get medicine. If you have any difficulties, he either goes to the trade union or asks the administration to find a way to solve them for you. Other Communist Party members are also like this. They always work before others and rest after others, and they are especially concerned about us workers. Sometimes when we have group meetings, the Party members often start by making self-criticisms, and they also ask us to give them our opinions. If the opinions are wrong, they will explain them to us. Communist Party members use various methods to help everyone carry out criticism and self-criticism, and to help everyone make progress. I really admire the Communist Party members, and I want to learn from the Communist Party members.

### 感谢毛主席，感谢共产党！

    感谢毛主席，感谢共产党！
    北京机器厂锻工  傅学文
    在这中国共产党的生日——“七一”快要到来的时候，我要说一说自己心里的话。我感谢毛主席，感谢共产党。我要宣传共产党的好处，向共产党学习。要不是毛主席和共产党，我怎么也不会有现在这样幸福的生活。
    过去我家里穷的什么也没有。我自小跟着父亲给地主种地，打的粮食，都交给地主了。后来遇着灾荒年，眼看家里人要饿死了，我就跑到北京来，求人介绍到一家铁工厂当搬运工。我干了三年多，净受日本鬼子的气，挨打受骂，被人当牛马使唤，所受痛苦说不完。
    好容易盼得日本鬼子投降了，谁知又来了国民党反动派。国民党反动派一心反对人民，打内战，弄得物价飞涨。那时候，我一天挣的钱，还不够一家四口人吃一顿玉米面。我老婆每天带着孩子去给人家缝衣洗衣，赚点钱填肚子。我那时住着工厂的房子。我老婆生孩子刚几天，厂里因为添了一个职员就逼着我们腾房子，把我们硬给撵出来。他们根本就没把工人当人看待，还管你生不生孩子！
    我有个给地主扛活的老乡，有一次到我家里来。他看见我一家穿得破破烂烂，吃又吃不上，就劝我到乡下去。我听了他的话，又带着老婆孩子回到乡下，给地主家去扛活。扛了八个月活，赚了六口袋老玉米。我下了工，家里粮食也吃完了。这时候，国民党又到处抓兵，我就躲到我们房后苇塘里。这时是十冬腊月天气，我在苇塘里藏了三天三夜，结果还是被庄子上的坏人看见了。伪保长把我抓去，送到距北京不远的清河镇伪警察局关押起来。恰在这时候，解放军来了。伪警察局关押的很多壮丁都被解放了。
    解放后过了一年，我回到工厂，当了锻工。过了不久，家乡里实行土地改革，我家分了十亩稻田，三间半房子，还有水车和零碎农具。打这以后，我的生活就一天一天好起来了。过去吃不上窝窝头，现在天天吃馒头。过去一家人穿得破破烂烂，现在都换了新衣服。过去连自己生活都顾不上，现在月月都有剩余。我还买了一辆自行车，上下工也不再跑路了。家里的地，主要是我老婆种，我每逢星期天去帮她。去年秋收时我还买了辆新打稻机。去年收成好，今年什么都有了。地里的粪也上的足。今年的收成可能比去年更好。
    要不是共产党来了，我能有这么好的光景么？要不是打跑了国民党反动派，成立了人民自己的政府，我家里能分到土地，我自己能这样安安稳稳地作工么？
    就拿我们村子里说吧，解放前村公所都是给地主们办事的，净欺负穷人，好事找不着你，要粮抓夫作苦力，你却样样少不了。现在的村政府跟以前可完全不一样了。有什么事开会跟大家商量，跟我们说话总是和和气气的。
    说我在工厂里吧。解放以前头子们一说话就瞪眼珠子，开口就骂，动不动就打。现在的工长呢，在做活的时候总是耐心教给你怎么干，有事给你商量，帮助你解决各种困难。要是在解放以前，你根本就不用想到这些。
    特别是厂里跟我一块干活的共产党员，他们干活总是抢着干。就拿我们锻工部的党员阎存义同志说吧，他的工作是开气锤，他在开气锤时总是告诉大家，要小心，别碰着；干什么活，他都给你出主意；遇着谁病了，他忙着帮你到医务所请医生，拿药；你要有什么困难，他不是到工会就是找行政给你想办法来解决。还有别的共产党员也是这样。他们总是干活在前，休息在后，对我们工友都特别关心。有时开小组会，常常是党员先检讨，还叫我们给他们提意见。意见提错了，还给我们解释。共产党员用各种办法帮助大家开展批评和自我批评，帮助大家进步。我心里真佩服共产党员，我要向共产党员学习。
