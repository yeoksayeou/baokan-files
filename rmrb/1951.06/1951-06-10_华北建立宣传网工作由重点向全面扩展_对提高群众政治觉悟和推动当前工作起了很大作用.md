　　The work of establishing propaganda networks in the North China region by the Chinese Communist Party has largely come to an end in key areas, and the region is now expanding from key areas to all areas. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces and two cities in the region, more than 70,000 propagandists and more than 3,000 reporters have been established. Propaganda networks have been widely established in some areas. For example, 90 percent of the CCP branches in Zhangjiakou City have established propaganda networks; in Wu'an County, Pingyuan Province, CCP branches that have established propaganda networks account for more than 60 percent of the total number of branches.

　　The propaganda network in North China was gradually established in conjunction with the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and promote patriotic production increase. Many CCP branches started by examining past work, educating Party members and cadres to recognize the importance of propaganda work, paying attention to cultivating activists in the movement, and developing them into propagandists. For example, when planting cotton in Mingyuedian, Ding County, Hebei Province last year, the cotton planting task was not completed because the grain to cotton price ratio policy was not properly publicized to the masses, and the peasants were simply ordered to plant cotton. The peasants were unwilling to plant more because they had ideological concerns, and they reported falsely to cope with the situation. After examining the above shortcomings, the local CCP organization made Party members realize the importance of propaganda work and seriously discussed the CCP Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network. The propaganda network was established more smoothly. In the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, many CCP committees and branches systematically and on a large scale cultivated activists who emerged in the movement and developed them into propagandists. For example, 41 CCP branches in Wanquan County, Chahar Province, developed more than 450 propagandists in the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Various provinces have also established reporters more generally. There are nearly 3,000 reporters in Hebei Province alone. These reporters are mostly responsible Party members in CCP organizations and People's Government organs. They regularly report on political and current affairs to cadres and the masses, which has played a significant role in raising the political consciousness of cadres and the masses. For example, Yang Xiufeng, one of the responsible persons of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee and chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, had made current affairs reports to cadres and labor model representatives in Handan, Shexian, Wu'an and other places in conjunction with the inspection of cotton planting work, which greatly promoted the work. Before May 1st, the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee sent more than 100 reporters to the countryside to make reports, which further popularized and deepened the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the area.

　　The establishment of propaganda networks has played a significant role in raising the political consciousness of the masses and promoting current work. The propagandists scattered among the broad masses have become a bridge connecting the Communist Party and the masses. Many propagandists in Hebei Province have become "question answerers" for the masses. Due to their frequent propaganda, the masses can promptly understand current affairs and various policies of the People's Government. In the propaganda for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, many model propagandists have emerged. For example, Zhao Xiling, a model street propagandist in Taiyuan City, is known as the "key to opening up the mind." In areas where the propaganda network is well established, various tasks are progressing smoothly. In Hebei Province, due to the in-depth propaganda of cotton price policies and the significance of patriotism and wealth creation by propagandists, many villages have formed a hot wave of drought resistance and cotton planting. Cadres saw that the propagandists played a role in actual work and said: "Where there are propagandists, the work is easy to do!" "In the past, only a few people ran around, but now there are helpers!" Many cadres and CCP members have changed their previous wrong view of belittling the establishment of propagandist work, and believe that establishing a propaganda network and doing a good job in propaganda work is one of the "magic weapons" for promoting work.

　　Regarding the leadership of propagandists, various places generally implement the various systems stipulated by the Central Committee. Such as holding propagandist representative meetings and running propagandist training courses, and regularly supplying propaganda materials. In Pingyuan, Shanxi and other places, propagandist teaching stations have also been established, and a bi-monthly teaching system has been established, so that propagandists can regularly obtain new propaganda materials.

### 华北建立宣传网工作由重点向全面扩展  对提高群众政治觉悟和推动当前工作起了很大作用

　　华北建立宣传网工作由重点向全面扩展
    对提高群众政治觉悟和推动当前工作起了很大作用
    中国共产党在华北区的组织重点建立宣传网的工作已大体告一段落，全区正由重点向全面扩展。据该区五省二市不完全统计，已设立宣传员七万多人，报告员三千多人。部分地区已普遍建立了宣传网。如张家口市已有百分之九十的中共支部建立了宣传网；平原省的武陟县，建立宣传网的中共支部占支部总数百分之六十以上。
    华北区的宣传网是结合抗美援朝、镇压反革命与爱国丰产运动逐步建立的。不少中共支部从检查过去工作着手，教育党员干部认识宣传工作的重要，注意培养运动中的积极分子，发展为宣传员。如河北定县明月店去年植棉时，因没向群众好好宣传粮棉比价政策，只简单地命令农民种棉。农民们因为思想上有顾虑，不愿多种，虚报应付。种棉的任务就没有完成。当地中共组织在检查了上述的缺点后使党员们认识了宣传工作的重要，认真讨论了中共中央关于建立宣传网的决定。宣传网就比较顺利地建立起来了。在抗美援朝运动中，不少中共党委和支部有计划地大规模地培养运动中涌现的积极分子，发展为宣传员。如察哈尔万全县四十一个中共支部在抗美援朝运动中就发展了四百五十多个宣传员。各省还较普遍地设立了报告员。仅河北省就有报告员近三千人。这些报告员多为中共组织和人民政府机关中的负责党员。他们定期向干部群众作政治时事报告，对提高干部与群众的政治觉悟起了很大作用。如中共河北省委员会负责人之一、河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰曾先后在邯郸、涉县、武安等地，结合检查植棉工作，向干部、劳动模范代表作时事报告，对工作起了很大推动作用。中共山西省委在“五一”前，曾派遣一百多名报告员下乡作报告，使该地抗美援朝运动得到进一步普及与深入。
    宣传网的建立，对提高群众政治觉悟和推动当前工作起了很大作用。散布在广大群众中的宣传员已成为共产党和群众联系的桥梁。河北省许多宣传员成了群众的“问事员”。由于他们的经常宣传，群众能及时了解时事与人民政府的各项政策。在抗美援朝与镇压反革命宣传中，涌现了不少模范宣传员。如太原市的模范街道宣传员赵锡岭，大家称他为“开脑筋的钥匙”。在宣传网建立较好的地方，各种工作进展顺利。河北省由于宣传员深入宣传了棉价政策以及爱国发家的意义，不少村已形成抗旱植棉的热潮。干部见到宣传员在实际工作中起了作用，就说：“那里有宣传员，那里工作就好作！”“过去只几个人跑，现在可有帮手了！”不少干部、中共党员，都改变了以往轻视建立宣传员工作的错误看法，认为建立宣传网作好宣传工作是推动工作的“法宝”之一。
    对宣传员的领导，各地一般执行了中央规定的各种制度。如举行宣传员代表会和办宣传员训练班，定期供给宣传材料等。平原、山西等地，更建立了宣传员传授站，确定了半月一次的传授制度，使宣传员经常能得到新的宣传材料。
