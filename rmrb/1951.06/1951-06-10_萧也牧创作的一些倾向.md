　　Some Tendencies in Xiao Yemu's Creations
　　Chen Yong
　　In recent years, the focus of our literary and artistic work has shifted from the countryside to the city. We have made some new achievements, but there are still many problems. For example, some literary and artistic workers have developed some unhealthy tendencies in their literary and artistic thinking or creation. These tendencies are essentially the petty-bourgeois tendencies that Chairman Mao criticized in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." In creation, it manifests as detachment from life or observing and expressing life from the perspective and tastes of the petty bourgeoisie. This tendency is not yet widespread, but it is of a serious nature and deserves our study and discussion.

　　Some of Comrade Xiao Yemu's works, mainly the short stories "Between Us Husband and Wife" and "On the Haihe River," can be used as examples of works with this type of tendency.

　　These two short stories were both written in the second half of 1949. They both had a significant impact on readers. We have heard many words of praise for them. Some said that the former is our model work because it proves that even "a very ordinary thing" can reveal "a theme of realistic significance," namely, "the struggle between two ideologies and sincere love." (Note)

　　Indeed, literary and artistic authors often need to discover "a theme of realistic significance" from "a very ordinary thing," but first of all, it depends on what kind of "ordinary thing" it is, whether it is "ordinary things" that can express "a theme of realistic significance," and we must further see how we express it. "Between Us Husband and Wife" does write about mostly ordinary things, and the author did intend to discover themes of realistic significance from ordinary things. A couple from different backgrounds, a husband with an intellectual background and a wife with a worker background (more precisely, a peasant background), had a split in their thoughts and feelings in their common life, and then reunited. The author intended to express the issue of the integration of intellectuals and workers and peasants from this concrete event.

　　There are some real and touching places in this work. For example, when a poor little girl is groundlessly suspected of theft, the wife feels indignant and pained. At this time, we can feel that we are indeed standing in front of a worker with natural class feelings; and when she is criticized for her impatience at work, her willingness to accept criticism is not easily achieved by ordinary intellectuals. Here, the author truthfully expresses some characteristics of worker cadres.

　　But apart from these few places, how else did the author describe his characters and their relationships?

　　The author used most of the space to describe some of the arguments between this worker cadre and her husband. In the author's pen, they argued endlessly about mostly "ordinary things," but as the author himself has realized more than once, they are all non-principle daily life trivia. For example, the husband believes that it is best to eat in a more luxurious restaurant, while the wife insists on going to a food stall in order to save money; the husband believes that he should smoke, but the wife is dissatisfied with this because she plans to make a small jacket for the child; after the husband receives royalties, he plans to buy leather shoes, cigarettes, and ice cream, but the wife secretly takes the money from under his pillow and sends it to her mother before her husband can realize this plan... It is worth noting that these things almost always set off a great wave between them, and the author always vividly and meticulously follows and describes all these details. But may I ask, how much "realistic significance" can these "ordinary things" express? Is this the kind of problem that occurs in the process of integration between intellectuals and workers and peasants?

　　It should be said that the author has vulgarized the "struggle between two ideologies" between intellectuals and workers and peasant cadres in these places.

　　And first of all, how could Li Ke, an intellectual cadre who has been trained for a long time, be shaken as soon as he enters the city, sees carpets with flowers, sofas, and jazz music, and feels that "a new life has begun"? How fragile are our cadres! I do not intend to deny that we have a few cadres like Li Ke. Moreover, criticizing such characters is not without educational significance for the vast number of cadres. But dialectics tells us that everything is conditional. Unless the author simultaneously correctly expresses the various conditions that produced Li Ke's thinking, people will think that this is a common phenomenon among our cadres, which objectively distorts reality.

　　The same view should be held for the female worker cadre. As pointed out earlier, the author wrote about some of her worker's advantages, but also wrote about her often arguing over daily trivial matters, and this latter aspect occupies a major position in this work. The problem is that the author himself, like the critic, thought that this could also express "themes of realistic significance." According to the author's introduction, this female cadre "came from a poor peasant background. She joined the revolution at the age of fifteen and worked in an ordnance factory for six full years." She had led other female workers to oppose the Japanese "mopping up" and also led female workers to rescue machines when the factory caught fire. Later, she became a model in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region. For such a cadre who has been trained for a long time, even if she still has some narrow and conservative rural ideas, how can she be described as a person who often argues over non-principle daily trivial matters?

　　But our author described her in this way.

　　Many of the images that the author particularly focused on and described are often embarrassing. In the author's pen, our heroine often utters unbearable curse words, such as "What is your ideology? You only know how to say nice things!" "Bullshit! Don't satirize people!" And there is even more than this. According to the author's description, our female cadre stopped using those curse words long after entering Beijing. Of course, according to this view, if this female cadre did not go to Beijing, this shortcoming would probably be difficult to correct, and in the countryside, there must be many people like her.

　　But is this view correct? Almost thirty years ago, Mr. Lu Xun severely criticized similar ideas. He said, "Now some works often unnecessarily write many curse words in the dialogue, as if it is thought that it is not a proletarian work unless this is done, and the more curses, the more proletarian the work is. In fact, there are many good workers and peasants who do not casually curse people. The author should not smear the behavior of Shanghai hooligans on them. Even if there are proletarians who like to curse, it is only a bad temper. The author should correct it through literature and art, and never expand it again, so that in the future proletarian society, a disagreement will cause three generations of ancestors to be in an inextricable mess." ("Abuse and intimidation are by no means fighting") Lu Xun's words thirty years ago are still of realistic significance for our author.

　　The author also has many descriptions that actually uglify our female cadre. For example, when writing about her complaining that eating in restaurants is too expensive and dragging her husband to a food stall to eat, the author deliberately wrote this passage:

　　"Probably because she saw that I (i.e., her husband—editor's note) was not speaking all the time, and was afraid that I was angry, she specially ordered a plate of smoked meat and said to me as if there was no one else around: 'Don't be angry! I'll improve your life!'"

　　And in another paragraph, when writing about the husband being unconcerned about the rural disaster and her family, so she got angry, the author wrote:

　　"...Unexpectedly, she reached out and pointed directly at my forehead: 'You heartless ghost! You forgot your roots! Who supported you for the past ten years?'"

　　What impression will our worker-born female cadre, who is described so vividly by the author, give us? I think the author should know that only past satirical novels can have this kind of writing.

　　Of course, the author can also argue that all the images of this worker cadre in the novel are expressed through the eyes of her intellectual husband, and the author later expressed criticism of her husband's views. But in fact, the power of the image is always far greater than the power of the "attitude" that the author declares elsewhere. The author's more real attitude is in the image of his work. No matter what the author declares later, it cannot change the impression given by this female worker.

　　Let's look at "On the Haihe River" again. This is a work that describes the lives of urban workers after liberation. The author's subjective purpose is probably to describe the free and happy life of workers after liberation and their new and reasonable marital relationships. A male worker named Danan and a female worker named Xiaohua have lived together since childhood and have suffered many hardships together. Although they have not explicitly expressed it to each other, they are in love with each other. But due to some misunderstandings, Danan often feels that Xiaohua loves a worker named Baocai, who also grew up with them, and he often feels jealous because of this. It was not until later, when he learned from Xiaohua that Baocai had married another female worker, that his doubts were dispelled, and he and Xiaohua formally expressed their love for each other.

　　This is the outline of this short story. Due to the author's skillful layout and careful description of love and some details of life, this work is very attractive to readers. But this work cannot help but make people feel that there is a rather strong petty-bourgeois atmosphere. Here, what attracts the author's attention the most, and what he writes about with the most relish, is the love between the young workers Danan and Xiaohua, and their love, and even their personalities, are added with many intellectual tastes and imaginations. The author wrote that they had been regarded as a "young couple" since they were young, and they were even more inseparable when they grew up. What they do is almost the same. "Ma Xiaohua joined the drama troupe, and Zhang Danan immediately joined. Zhang Danan joined the production mutual aid group, and Ma Xiaohua also signed up. Ma Xiaohua joined the Communist Youth League, and Zhang Danan immediately applied to join the League..." Not only that, they even look very similar:

　　"Others thought they were brothers; in this way, the appearance of these two people seemed to be very similar: both were thin and tall, with long eyelashes, straight noses, and although their faces were a little thin, they looked—especially their eyes, flickering, very refreshing and smart... They were wearing the same style of tennis shoes, and pinned a same style of Chairman Mao's portrait on their chests... If you look closely at the 'service card' pinned on their chests, you will know that they are saying the wrong thing—the man's surname is Zhang, named Danan; the woman's surname is Ma, named Xiaohua, obviously not a family."

　　Almost the entire novel is written in a similar tone.

　　The author described such a scene: Xiaohua gave Danan advice. Xiaohua said that Danan "is not bad in production, work, and study, except that he doesn't like to study; that is, there are still two small shortcomings in life," what are those two "small shortcomings"? "First, you like to smoke, which is both wasteful and smelly..." Second, "It's not worth mentioning—look at your little jacket, who is like you? Too sloppy!" Then the author went on to describe Danan's reaction, saying:

　　"Danan smiled embarrassedly! He felt a kind of happy and embarrassed feeling in his heart!"

　　This is indeed written "meticulously," but does such "meticulousness" help us to truly understand the lives and feelings of workers? I think readers should not fail to express doubts.

　　What is particularly noteworthy is that this young worker, who is known as "not bad in production, work, and study," shows himself to be very narrow-minded in many places and lacks the feeling of a leader of the working class and the master of the new country. In the author's pen, he is often dominated and manipulated by a narrow love emotion of jealousy and suspicion. For example, when Xiaohua mentions Baocai's advantages in front of him, he cannot bear to say:

　　"How can I compare to him? What am I? He is smart, capable, and the leader of the Communist Youth League group. The young man is also good-looking!"

　　Even after he joined the Communist Youth League, he refused to participate in the competition because the group did not assign him and Xiaohua to compete. The following is a description of a quarrel between him and Xiaohua over this matter:

　　"At this time, Xiaohua couldn't help but said: 'Hey! Look at you! You don't even have the taste of a League member!' Danan got angry: 'You are good, you are good! You have the taste of a League member! You have the taste of a League member! You pick Li Baocai!' Xiaohua wouldn't let him, and said: 'You have to remember that you are a League member, do you know what the responsibility of a League member is?' Danan said: 'I don't have such a good memory, I don't know!'"

　　It is such a young worker, a member of the Communist Youth League, when he learned that his family was going to marry him another woman, and Xiaohua also vaguely advised him to listen to his family, he "felt cold all over" and "stared at the flowing water with his eyes motionless and said: 'Xiaohua, I would rather die!'" Let's see, how narrow is the spiritual world of this young worker, this member of the Communist Youth League, as expressed by the author! How low is his level of consciousness! If we want to really find the characteristics of a leader of the working class and the master of a new country here, he will not be disappointed!

　　Naturally, the author also described that Danan finally participated in the competition and achieved good results. But it should be mentioned that we are not very clear about what kind of force prompted Danan to do so, since he initially refused to compete so firmly, but then suddenly participated in the competition so actively.

　　Obviously, in this work, as in "Between Us Husband and Wife," the main problem is not whether or not to describe daily life or love events, but whether or not to describe them correctly. Through daily life and love events, the qualities of new people and the characteristics of the new society can also be expressed.

　　An author who is familiar with the thoughts and feelings of workers and peasants and has no separation from them would not give the heroine of "Between Us Husband and Wife" those crude and ugly images; similarly, he would not describe the character and life of workers like "On the Haihe River." Although "Between Us Husband and Wife" also truthfully describes and thus affirms the natural class feelings of the heroine, as Chairman Mao said, intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins "also love workers, peasants, and soldiers in some aspects, and also love cadres from workers, peasants, and soldiers, but sometimes they don't love, and in some places they don't love, they don't love their feelings, they don't love their posture..." Our author's concentrated and exaggerated description of our heroine's daily life style and habits should be explained here.

　　As for the lives and feelings of the workers described in "On the Haihe River," they are actually just the lives and feelings of the petty bourgeoisie. Here, the author does not seem to have considered distinguishing what kind of life and feelings belong to the petty bourgeoisie and what kind of life and feelings belong to the working class; in fact, he has added the life and feelings that an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois origin imagines and yearns for to the workers, and this result makes many parts of his work still unable to escape the scope of "clothes are workers, peasants, and soldiers, but the face is petty bourgeoisie" that Chairman Mao said.

　　We should also remember that Comrade Xiao Yemu, who wrote "Between Us Husband and Wife" and "On the Haihe River," has also written many works that do not contain this kind of ideological problems. For example, his first collection, "Mountain Village Chronicles," is generally a good collection. Although, readers will also feel that the liberated rural areas, which have experienced extremely complex and heroic struggles, still require richer and more solid works than this collection. The author's contact here is not wide enough. But in any case, this collection shows that the author has enthusiasm for the peasants, so he can affectionately describe the ordinary characters in the countryside and describe the customs and atmosphere of the countryside. And from here, we can also feel the changes in the liberated rural areas during the Anti-Japanese War, rent reduction, and land reform.

　　This collection includes works from 1943, which shows that the author has had a fairly long creative life, and also shows that he has undergone a longer period of revolutionary life training, but he still wrote works containing petty-bourgeois ideological emotions like "Between Us Husband and Wife" and "On the Haihe River" in recent years, which may be surprising. But this matter just shows that the transformation of literary and artistic workers from petty-bourgeois origins is a long-term process, and a person who forgets to be vigilant of himself is particularly likely to cause the resurgence of old thoughts and feelings in a particularly complex urban environment, and is also particularly likely to accept the influence of various external non-proletarian ideas.

　　Therefore, I think it is meaningful to study and discuss works like "Between Us Husband and Wife" and "On the Haihe River."

### 萧也牧创作的一些倾向

　　萧也牧创作的一些倾向
    陈涌
    近几年来，我们文艺工作的重心由乡村转移到城市，我们有了一些新的成就，但也还存在着许多问题，例如，有一部分的文艺工作者在文艺思想或者创作方面产生了一些不健康的倾向，这种倾向实质上也就是毛主席在延安文艺座谈会讲话中已经批判过的小资产阶级的倾向。它在创作上的表现是脱离生活，或者依据小资产阶级的观点、趣味来观察生活，表现生活。这种倾向在现在还不是普遍存在的，但它带有严重的性质，是值得我们加以研究、讨论的。
    萧也牧同志的一部分作品，主要是短篇《我们夫妇之间》和《海河边上》，可以作为带有此类倾向的作品的例子。
    这两个短篇都写于一九四九年的下半年，它们都曾在读者中间发生过较大的影响，其中赞誉的词句我们是听到过很多的，有的说前者是我们模范的作品，因为它证明了即使是“一件很平凡的事”，也能发现“有现实意义的主题”，亦即“两种思想斗争和真挚的爱情”。（注）
    的确，文艺作者往往需要从“一件很平凡的事”发现“有现实意义的主题”的，但首先还要看是什么样“平凡的事”，是否能表现“有现实意义的主题”的“平凡的事”，而且还要进一步看我们怎样去表现它。《我们夫妇之间》，写的的确大都是平凡的事，并且作者也的确打算从平凡的事里发现有现实意义的主题。一对出身不同的夫妇，知识分子出身的丈夫和工人出身（更恰当地说是农民出身）的妻子，他们在共同生活中思想感情发生了分裂，后来又重新得到结合，作者是打算从这具体事件里表现知识分子与工农结合的问题的。
    这作品有一些写得真实、令人感动的地方。例如，为了一个穷苦的小女孩无端被人猜疑有偷窃行为，那个做妻子的便感到愤慨、苦痛，这时候，我们会感觉得到站在我们面前的的确是一个具有天然的阶级感情的工人；而当她由于工作中的急躁情绪受到批评时，她的那种勇于接受批评的态度，也是普通的知识分子不易做到的。在这里，作者真实的表现了工人干部的一些特点。
    但除了这少数地方外，作者又怎样描写了他的人物和他们的相互关系呢？
    作者用了大部分的篇幅来描写这个工人干部和她丈夫的一些争论。在作者笔下，他们争论不休的，大都是些“平凡的事”，但也正如作者自己也不只一次的意识到的，都是些非原则的日常生活的琐事，例如丈夫认为吃饭最好在比较堂皇的饭馆，而妻子却为了节省坚持去饭摊；丈夫认为应该抽烟而妻子却为此不满，因为她打算替小孩子做一件小褂；丈夫在得到稿费以后打算买皮鞋、香烟和冰淇淋，而妻子却在她丈夫实现这计划之前，暗地从他枕头下把钱拿走，寄给了她的母亲………值得注意的是，这些事情几乎都在他们中间掀起了轩然大波，而作者也总是绘声绘影地、一丝不苟地跟踪描写这一切细节的。但试问，这些“平凡的事”能表现多少“有现实意义的主题”呢？难道知识分子和工农结合过程中间发生的问题，便是这类问题么？
    应当说，作者在这些地方是把知识分子与工农干部之间的“两种思想斗争”庸俗化了的。
    而且首先，那位叫李克的，经过长时间锻炼的知识分子干部，怎么一进了城，见了有花的地毯、沙发、爵士音乐便发生动摇，便感到“新的生活开始了”呢？我们的干部又何其脆弱！我这样说也并不是打算否认我们有少数像李克这样的干部存在，而且，对于这类人物加以批判，对于广大的干部并不是没有教育意义的。但是辩证法告诉我们，一切都是有条件的，除非作者同时正确地表现了李克这种思想产生的各种条件，否则，人们会以为这就是我们干部中间普遍存在的现象，客观上是歪曲了现实的。
    对于那位女工人干部，也应该有同样的看法。如前面已指出过的，作者一面写出了她某些工人的优点，但又写了她经常为了日常的琐事而争吵，而且这后一方面在这作品里是占主要地位的。问题只是作者自己也正如那位批评者一样以为这也可以表现“有现实意义的主题”。依据作者的介绍，这位女干部是“贫农出身，她十五岁就参加了革命，在军火工厂里整整做了六年工”，曾经领导过别的女工反对日本人的“扫荡”，也领导过女工在工厂失火时抢救机器，后来还当了晋察冀边区的模范，对于这样一个经过长时间锻炼的干部，就算她身上还带着一些农村的狭隘保守的观念，也怎么可以描写成为一个经常为了一些非原则的日常生活的琐事而争吵的人？
    但我们的作者正是这样的描写了她的。
    作者特别聚精会神地加以描写的她的许多形象，往往是令人难堪的。在作者笔下，我们这位女主角经常满口令人不忍卒听的骂人的话，例如“你是什么思想，光他妈的会说漂亮话！”“放你妈的臭屁！你别讽刺人啦！”而且还有更甚于此者。依据作者的描写，我们这位女干部是在进了北京之后好久才停止了使用那些骂人的口头语的。当然，依据这种看法，这位女干部如果不到北京，这个缺点大约是很难纠正，而且在农村里，像她一样的人，一定是很多的了。
    但这种看法是正确的么？在差不多三十年以前，鲁迅先生便曾经严厉地批判过类似的思想，他说：“现在有些作品往往并非必要而偏在对话里写上许多骂语去，好像以为非此便不是无产者作品，骂詈愈多，就愈是无产者作品似的。其实好的工农之中，并不随口骂人的多得很，作者不应该将上海流氓的行为，涂在他们身上的。即使有喜欢骂人的无产者，也只是一种坏脾气，作者应该由文艺加以纠正，万不可再来展开，使将来的无产阶级社会中，一言不合，便祖宗三代的闹得不可开交。”（“辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗”）鲁迅三十年前说过的这段话，对于我们的作者，还是有现实意义的。
    作者还有许多实际上是把我们这位女干部丑化了的描写，例如写到她嫌饭馆吃饭太贵，拉了丈夫到饭摊去吃饭，作者特意写了这样一段：
    “大概她见我（即他的丈夫——摘引者注）老不说话，怕我生气，就格外要了一碟子熏肉，旁若无人地对我说：‘别生气了！给你改善改善生活！’”
    而在另一段，写到丈夫对于农村的灾荒、对她的家庭不关心因而她生气了时，作者写道：
    “……冷不防，她一伸手，一指头直通到我的额上：‘没良心的鬼！你忘了本啦！这十年来谁养活你来着？’”
    被作者这样绘声绘影地描写的我们这位工人出身的女干部，会给我们一种什么印象呢？我以为作者是应该知道，只有过去的讽刺小说才能有这种写法的。
    当然，作者也可以辩解说，小说里所有关于这位工人干部的形象，都是通过她的知识分子的丈夫的眼光来表现的，而作者后来是表示批判她丈夫的看法的。但实际上，形象的力量总是远超过作者另外宣布的“态度”的力量，作者更真实的态度，是在他的作品的形象里面的。无论作者后来宣布什么，也是不能改变这位女工所给人的印象的了。
    我们再来看“海河边上”。这是描写解放以后城市工人生活的作品。作者主观的目的大约是描写解放后工人自由快乐的生活，描写他们新的合理的婚姻关系。一个叫大男的男工，和一个叫小花的女工从小就生活在一起，共同身受过许多苦难。虽然彼此都并没有明白的表示，但他们是互相爱恋着的。但由于一些误会，大男却常常感到小花心里爱着一个也是从小和他们在一起的叫宝才的工人，他为此常常发生嫉妒的感情。直到后来，他从小花口中知道了宝才已经和另一个女工结婚，他的疑忌才算消释，他和小花才正式的表白了彼此的爱情。
    这便是这个短篇的梗概。由于作者巧妙的布局和对恋爱和对一些生活细节的细心的描写，这作品是很能吸引读者的。但这作品不能不令人感到有相当浓厚的小资产阶级气氛。在这里，最吸引作者注意，而且也写得最津津有味的，是年青工人大男和小花的恋爱，而他们的恋爱，以至他们的个性，都是加上了许多知识分子的趣味和想像的。作者写到他们从小就曾被看作“小两口子”，长大了更是形影不离，他们所做的事几乎都是一样的，“马小花参加了剧团，张大男马上也参加了。张大男参加了生产互助组，马小花也就报了名。马小花参加了青年团，张大男马上就申请入团……”不但这样，他们甚至外表也简直十分相像：
    “旁人以为他们是兄弟俩；这样，这两个人的相貌仿佛也极相似了：都是细高条，长眼毛，直鼻梁，脸面虽然都有点清瘦，可是看起来——特别是他们那眼神，忽撩忽撩的，显得很清爽，很聪明……他俩穿着一个样式的网球鞋，胸前别着一个样式的毛主席像……如果再仔细看看他俩别在胸前的那‘服务证’，才知道是说差了——男的姓张叫大男；女的姓马叫小花，分明不是一家子。”
    几乎整篇小说，都是用类似的笔调写成的。
    作者描写了这样一个场面：小花给大男提意见。小花说，大男“生产上、工作上、学习上都不赖，除了不好学习；就是生活上还有两个小缺点，”那两个“小缺点”呢？“第一，你好抽烟，又浪费又有味儿……”第二，“值不得一提——看你那小褂，谁像你呵？太拉塌啦！”于是作者接着描写大男的反应说：
    “大男不好意思地笑了！心里有一种又高兴又难为情的滋味儿！”
    这的确是写得“细致入微”的，但这样的“细致入微”有助于我们真实的了解工人的生活、工人的感情么？我想，读者是不应该不表示怀疑的。
    特别令人注目的是，这位被称为“生产上、工作上、学习上都不赖”的年青工人，许多地方都表现得十分狭隘，十分缺少领导阶级的人物、新国家的主人公的感觉的。在作者的笔下，他经常为一种嫉妒、猜忌的狭隘的恋爱感情所支配，所捉弄的，例如当小花在他面前提起宝才的好处时，他便不能忍受地说：
    “我怎么就比上他了？我是个老几？人家又机灵，又有能耐，又是青年团的小组长，小伙儿又长得漂亮！”
    即使在他参加了青年团以后，为了小组不分配他和小花竞赛，他便拒绝参加竞赛。下面是为了这件事情他和小花发生争吵的一段描写：
    “这时候，小花忍不住说了话了：‘嗨！看你那个样子！连点团员味儿也没有！’大男就火儿啦：‘你行你行！你有团员味儿！你有团员味儿！你跟李宝才挑吧！’小花也不让他，说：‘你得记着你是个团员，你知道团员的责任是什么？’大男说：‘我没有那好记性，我不知道！’”
    便是这样的一个年青工人，青年团员，当他知道家里要另外替他娶亲，而小花也含糊其词地劝他听家里话的时候，他便“混身发冷”，“两眼一动不动的盯着流水说：‘小花，我宁愿死！’”我们看看，作者所表现的这个年青工人，这个青年团员的精神世界是何等狭窄！他的觉悟程度又何等低下！如果我们要想在这里实在找寻一个领导阶级的人物、一个新国家主人公的特点，他是不能不大失所望的！
    自然，作者也描写到大男后来终于参加了竞赛，并且得到了很好的成绩。但应该一提的是，大男起初那样坚决地拒绝竞赛，后来忽然又那么积极地参加了竞赛，到底是一种什么力量推动他那样做，我们是不很清楚的。
    显然，在这个作品里也和在《我们夫妇之间》一样，主要问题并不在于能否描写日常生活，描写恋爱事件，主要的问题是在于能否正确地去描写。经过日常生活，经过恋爱的事件，也可以表现新人的品质，新社会的特点。
    一个熟悉工农的思想感情和工农并无间隔的作者，他是不会给《我们夫妇之间》的女主角以那些粗恶、丑陋的形象的；同样的，他也不会像《海河边上》那样描写工人的性格和生活。《我们夫妇之间》虽然也真实地描写了因而也肯定了那女主角的那种天然的阶级感情，但正如毛主席所说的，小资产阶级出身的知识分子“在某些方面也爱工农兵，也爱工农兵出身的干部，但有些时候不爱，有些地方不爱，不爱他们的感情，不爱他们的姿态……”，我们的作者所以集中和夸大的描写了我们女主角的日常生活的作风、习惯，应该在这里得到说明。
    至于《海河边上》所描写的工人的生活、感情，实际上只是小资产阶级式的生活、感情。在这里，作者似乎还没有考虑到应该分别什么样的生活、感情是属于小资产阶级的，什么样的生活、感情是属于工人阶级的；事实上他是把一个小资产阶级出身的知识分子所想像、所向往的生活、感情加到工人的头上了，这结果使他这个作品许多地方仍然逃不出毛主席说过的“衣服是工农兵，面孔却是小资产阶级”这个范围。
    我们还应当记得，写了《我们夫妇之间》和《海河边上》的萧也牧同志，还写过不少并不包含这类思想问题的作品。例如他最初的集子《山村纪事》一般说来是一个好的集子。虽然，读者也会感觉到，经历过异常复杂、壮烈的斗争的解放区农村，还要求比这集子更丰富和更坚实的作品。作者在这里所接触的面还是不够宽广的。但无论如何，这集子表明，作者对农民是有热情的，因而他能够亲切地描写着农村里的平凡的人物，描写着农村的风习、气氛。并且从这里，我们也可以感觉得到抗日、减租、土地改革过程中解放区农村的变动。
    这集子包括一九四三年的作品，可见作者已经有过相当长的创作生活，也可见他曾经过了较长的革命生活的锻炼，但他到了近年还写了像《我们夫妇之间》和《海河边上》包含着小资产阶级思想情绪的作品，这也许是令人感到惊奇的吧。但这事情正好说明，小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者的改造是长期的，一个忘记了警惕自己的人，在特别复杂的城市的环境下，便特别容易引起旧思想情感的抬头，也特别容易接受各种外来的非无产阶级思想的影响。
    因此，研究和讨论《我们夫妇之间》和《海河边上》这样的作品，我以为是有意义的。
