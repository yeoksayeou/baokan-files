　　People's Bank of China Northeast District Branch Issues 160 Billion in Agricultural Loans
    To support farmers in increasing the production of industrial raw material crops and commodity grains, the People's Bank of China Northeast District Branch promptly issued a large amount of agricultural loans. As of mid-May, the total amount of loans issued in various regions has reached 160 billion RMB. Among them, the main loans for seeds, draft animals, spring plowing tools, ammonium sulfate, and bean cakes were issued before the spring plowing preparation period. Other loans, such as those for pesticides and cultivating machines, are still being issued.
    The proportions of various agricultural loans issued by the Northeast District Branch this year are as follows: special product loans, mainly for the development of industrial raw material crops, accounted for 37.47% of the total; general agricultural loans, mainly for increasing the production of commodity grains, accounted for 34.39% of the total; and the remaining 28.14% of the total was used to support the production of local farms and to solve the urgent needs of general farmers engaged in handicrafts, sideline occupations, and daily life. To ensure that farmers who obtained loans could purchase production materials in a timely manner, the People's Bank of China Northeast District Branch had already loaned the agricultural loans prepared for this year to agricultural, forestry, trade, and cooperative departments last winter, and purchased a large number of production materials, which were distributed to various regions. In early March, the supply and marketing departments in various regions sold these production materials to farmers simultaneously with the bank's loans.
    The rational issuance of agricultural loans has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of farmers to plant industrial raw material crops and commodity grains. After obtaining a large number of pesticides, ammonium sulfate fertilizers, seeds, flue-cured tobacco equipment, and sprayers, farmers in Liaodong Province have expanded the planting area of cotton, tobacco, and jute. At present, the cotton planting area in Liaodong Province has expanded by 71.5% compared with last year, exceeding the original planting plan for this year by 9.1%; the jute planting area has exceeded four and a half times that of last year, exceeding the original plan for this year by 27.6%. The tobacco planting area in the province this year accounts for 72% of the total tobacco planting area in Northeast China, exceeding three times that of last year and exceeding the original plan for this year by 3.4%.

　　人民银行东北区行发放农贷千六百亿
    中国人民银行东北区行为了扶助农民增产工业原料作物和商品粮食，及时发放了巨额农业贷款。截至五月中旬止，各地贷出总额已达人民币一千六百余亿元。其中种籽、耕畜、春耕农具以及硫安、豆饼等项主要贷款，早在准备春耕期间就已发放完毕。其余如农药、铲趟机等贷款，仍在发放中。
    东北区行今年各种农业贷款的比例是：以发展工业原料作物为主的特产贷款占总额的百分之三十七点四七，以增产商品粮食为主的一般农业贷款占百分之三十四点三九，其余占总额百分之二十八点一四的贷款，用于扶助各地农场生产和解决一般农民从事手工业、副业及生活上的急需。为了使获得贷款的农民及时购得生产资料，人民银行东北区行在去年冬季即将今年准备发放的农贷先行贷给农林、贸易、合作等部门，购置了大批生产资料，分运各地。今年三月初旬，各地供销部门即结合银行放款同时将这些生产资料卖给农民。
    农贷的合理发放，大大提高了农民种植工业原料作物和商品粮食的情绪。辽东省农民自获得了大批农药、硫安肥料、种籽、烤烟器材以及喷雾器等贷款后，纷纷扩大棉、烟、麻的播种面积。目前辽东省的棉田播种面积已较去年扩大了百分之七十一点五，并超过了今年原订播种计划的百分之九点一；洋麻播种面积已超过去年的四倍半，超过今年原计划的百分之二十七点六。该省今年烟草播种面积占东北全区植烟面积的百分之七十二，超过去年的三倍，超过今年原计划的百分之三点四。
