　　Beijing area railway workers are universally beginning to inspect patriotic pacts and launch a movement to donate airplanes and cannons, preparing to donate a "Beijing Railway Workers" airplane within six months. The Mao Zedong locomotive crew has set a plan to maintain the locomotive well, saving more than 50% of materials each month and 5% of coal, and donating all coal saving bonuses and 50% of the safe kilometer bonus to purchase airplanes and cannons. The crews of the model locomotives Nos. 1939 and 1751 have also formulated specific plans to eliminate accidents, strive to save 5% of locomotive coal and 15% of locomotive materials, and donate all safe kilometer bonuses and 30% of coal saving bonuses. The 12 members of the Beijing Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative trade union group decided to participate in voluntary labor every Sunday to load and unload goods and donate the resulting loading and unloading fees. Workers in the power section and the station passenger and freight workshops have also made specific plans to participate in voluntary labor, starting from the 5th. Many other units' employees also proposed donating bonuses or starting voluntary labor. Some employees also used other methods to increase income for donations. The Beijing Train Section proposed donating part or all of the monthly book sales profit. The trade union district committee agency group proposed strengthening communication and reporting, and donating manuscript fees. Some employee theatrical troupes are also preparing benefit performances. Many employees are also launching donation campaigns by practicing personal frugality, such as the Beijing Branch Transportation Section, the four groups of Cao Peixuan of the Fengtai Electrical Section, and the Beijing Train Section train captains, who all proposed donating one day's salary per person per month until the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. Some immediately donated cash, such as the ten members of Su Mingde's group at the West Station, who donated 1,200 catties of millet. Another six groups of forty-eight people donated 2,100 catties of millet.
    According to the enthusiastic demands of the working masses, the Beijing Railway Branch and the Railway Trade Union District Committee proposed to donate a "Beijing Railway Workers" airplane.
