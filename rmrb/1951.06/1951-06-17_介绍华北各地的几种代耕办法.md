　　Introducing Several Methods of Substitute Farming in North China

　　I. Contract Farming System: Its characteristic is that the object of substitute farming is fixed, that is, the land requiring substitute farming is fixed to be cultivated by several households, and other households that should provide substitute farming then return labor or find grain for the substitute farmers. This is beneficial to both the substitute farmers and the military families (including families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, disabled veterans, demobilized soldiers, and non-salaried staff, etc., hereinafter the same). The methods are as follows:

　　(1) Large Contract Farming: The substitute farming household (or group) voluntarily enters into a contract with the military family to determine the output of the substitute farmed land. Except for cases where production is reduced due to force majeure disasters, the substitute farmer should deliver grain to the military family according to the agreed output. The excess belongs to the substitute farmer, and the deficiency is compensated. The advantage of this method is that it can guarantee the output of the military family's land, and it is suitable for impoverished military families with no labor force. This method is used in few areas because it is only suitable for areas with a foundation for substitute farming and a high level of mass awareness, and it should not be forced.

　　(2) Small Contract Farming: Only the substitute farmer (or group) and the number of substitute farming labor days are fixed, but the output is not guaranteed. This method is suitable for military families with some labor and livestock, because they also participate in agricultural production themselves, and only helping them with some labor and livestock is sufficient. This method is more flexible and simple than large contract farming, can improve the enthusiasm of the substitute farmers, guarantee a certain amount of output, and facilitate planned integration with their own land cultivation. The disadvantage is that the output is not fully guaranteed. This method is widely promoted in various regions.

　　(3) Subletting or Collecting According to Share: This method can be used in areas lacking labor force and unable to implement the contract farming system, and for military families with no labor force. For example, in some disaster areas in Hebei Province, the land of military families is sublet or divided into four-six shares with others. The smaller share of grain received by the military family is compensated by the persons who should provide substitute farming. The advantage of this method is that the lives of military families are guaranteed, and the land will not be wasted or reduced in production, which can overcome the difficulty of local labor shortage. The disadvantage is that it easily breeds a dependence mentality among military families, who wait to receive grain without engaging in production.

　　II. Labor Coupon System (i.e., Substitute Farming by Levying Grain): The labor cost of substitute farming is determined and converted into labor coupons, which are issued to military families, who can hire people to substitute farm with the coupons. The labor coupons earned by substitute farmers or the labor coupons saved by military families can be exchanged for grain from the government. In various places, labor force is planned and coordinated on the basis of administrative villages or districts and counties, and the persons who should provide substitute farming pay labor with grain. The advantages of this method are that the accounting is simple, and it is very flexible to use; substitute farmers are motivated to work; the burden is not heavy, and it is also reasonable; and it can encourage military families to participate in production. The disadvantages are: implementing this method on the basis of villages, because the number of military families in each village is different, and the labor force for substitute farming is also different, it is easy to form a phenomenon of uneven distribution of workload and unequal hardship. Implementing this method on the basis of districts and counties, although it can overcome the shortcomings of villages as the unit, it is not easy to accurately understand the labor and livestock situation in the entire district and county, and it is easy to produce localism bias in villages and districts, underreporting the labor force, or overreporting the number of substitute farming households and the area of substitute farming land.

　　III. Temporary Dispatching System: That is, the so-called "random selection of soldiers" method. When military families need labor, the village cadres temporarily dispatch it. This method has great disadvantages: the substitute farmers are not responsible, the output is not guaranteed, labor is wasted, and the masses and military families are dissatisfied. Therefore, this method should no longer be used.

### 介绍华北各地的几种代耕办法

　　介绍华北各地的几种代耕办法
    一、包耕制：其特点是代耕对象固定，即将需要代耕的土地固定由几户耕种，其他应代耕户再向代耕人还工或找粮，这对代耕者与军属（包括烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、非薪金制工作人员的家属等，以下同）双方都有利。其方式有如下几种：
    （１）大包耕：代耕户（或组）与军属自愿订立合同，确定代耕土地的产量。除遇不可抗拒的灾害而减产者另议外，代耕者应按约定产量向军属交粮，超过部分归代耕者，不足则补交。这种办法的优点是能保证军属土地的产量，适用于毫无劳动力的贫苦军属。采用这种办法的地区尚少，因为它只适用于代耕有基础和群众觉悟较高的地区，不可勉强推行。
    （２）小包耕：只是固定代耕人（或组）和代耕工数，而不保证产量。此种方式适合于有部分劳、畜力的军属，因为他们自己也参加农业生产，只要帮助他们一部劳、畜力就可以。这种方式较大包耕制灵活简便，能提高代耕者的积极性，产量有一定的保证，并便于有计划地与自己的土地结合耕作。缺点是产量无十足保证。此种办法，在各地推行较广。
    （３）转租或按成分收：在缺乏劳动力无法实行包耕制的地区，及对毫无劳动力的军属户可以采用这种办法。如河北省有些灾区，就把军属土地转租或和别人四六分收。军属少得的一部分粮食，由应代耕人分摊补偿。这种办法的好处是军属生活有保障，土地不致荒废或减产，可以克服当地劳动力缺少的困难。缺点是易使军属滋生依赖思想，坐待收粮，不事生产。
    二、工票制（即征米代耕）：将代耕所用人工规定价格，折成工票，发给军属，凭票雇人代耕。代耕人挣的工票或军属节余下的工票，都可凭票向政府兑粮。各地都是以行政村或区、县为单位实行劳力统筹，由应代耕人以粮齐工。这种办法的优点是算账简便，运用起来也很灵便；代耕者干起活来有劲；负担不重，也很合理；并可鼓励军属参加生产。缺点是：以村为单位实行这种办法，因各村的军属多少不一，代耕的劳动力也不相同，容易形成畸轻畸重，苦乐不均的现象。以区、县为单位实行这种办法，虽可以克服以村为单位的缺点，但因全区、县劳、畜力情况不容易确切了解，容易产生村、区的本位主义偏向，少报劳动力，或多报代耕户数及代耕土地面积。
    三、临时派工制：即所谓“乱点兵”的办法。军属用工时，由村干部临时拨派。这种办法有很大缺点：代耕者不负责，产量无保障，浪费劳动力，群众与军属都不满。因此，这种办法不宜再用。
