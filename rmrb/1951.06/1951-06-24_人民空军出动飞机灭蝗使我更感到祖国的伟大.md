    The People's Air Force Dispatches Aircraft to Eliminate Locusts,
    Making Me Feel Even More the Greatness of the Motherland
    Seeing the news published on the front page of the People's Daily on June 14th that the People's Air Force dispatched four aircraft to eliminate locusts in northern Anhui, I felt even more deeply the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. Only the People's Government can be so concerned about the interests of the people.
    I remember when I was seven or eight years old, one day after lunch, I followed my father to the fields to pull corn seedlings. When we arrived at the field, the seedlings were green and lush, really lovely. My father said with a smile, "This is a good start to the year!" Who knew that soon after, a swarm of locusts flew in from the south and landed in the field. In less than fifteen minutes, they ate all the green corn seedlings in a field, leaving only bare stalks. My father was so anxious that he clenched his fists, stamped his feet, and shook his head, almost crying! But what could he do to salvage the situation? The reactionary government at the time did not care about the lives of the people, only knowing how to increase exorbitant taxes, making it impossible for the people to continue living.
    Today, the People's Government dispatches aircraft to eliminate locusts; this is a stark contrast to the past. Now, American imperialism and its accomplices are still trying in every possible way to disrupt us. Under these circumstances, as soon as the People's Government learns that the people are suffering from locust plagues, it immediately sends aircraft to help the people eliminate the pests. This shows how much the People's Government cares about the interests of the people!
    I love our motherland. I must contribute all my strength, work actively, and make the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea come sooner. I will use practical actions to defend our great and lovable motherland.

### 人民空军出动飞机灭蝗使我更感到祖国的伟大

　　人民空军出动飞机灭蝗
     使我更感到祖国的伟大
    看到六月十四日人民日报第一版所刊人民空军出动飞机四架，前往皖北灭蝗的消息，使我更深深地感到祖国的伟大和可爱。只有人民政府，才能这样关心人民的利益。
    记得在七、八岁的时候，有一天，我吃过午饭，跟着爸爸到田里拔苞米苗。到了地头一看，满地小苗长得绿油油的，实在可爱。爸爸笑着对我说：“今年年头不错啊！”谁知道不久后，从南方飞过来一群蝗虫，都落在地里。不到十几分钟，把一块地里绿油油的苞米苗，全部吃成了光秆。我爸爸急得磨拳擦掌跺脚摇头，几乎要哭出来！但是他又有什么办法来挽救呢？当时的反动政府，不管人民死活，只知道加苛捐杂税，使人民无法再生活下去。
    今天，人民政府派遣飞机灭蝗；这和过去的情况是一个鲜明的对比。现在美帝国主义及其帮凶，还千方百计地来扰乱我们。人民政府在这种情况下，一知道人民受到蝗害，马上便派飞机来帮助人民除害。这说明：人民政府是多么关心人民的利益！
    我热爱我们的祖国。我一定要贡献出我所有的力量，积极工作，使抗美援朝的最后胜利提早到来。我要用实际行动来保卫我们伟大而可爱的祖国。
