　　Farmers in parts of Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and Shandong are organized to eliminate locusts

　　Recently, locust nymphs have been widely discovered in parts of Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui, with Northern Anhui being the most severely affected.

　　After the discovery of locust nymphs, all localities immediately organized special leading bodies for locust control work. Guanyun County established a headquarters on June 1st, with the county head personally serving as the commander, and relevant districts also established brigades. The Huaiyin Prefectural People's Government also sent a number of cadres with pesticides and equipment to Guanyun County to assist in locust control. After the discovery of locust nymphs, Sihong County also immediately established a locust eradication headquarters, with brigades, squadrons, platoons, or groups set up at the district, township, and village levels. From May 19th to June 2nd, 130,000 people in the county participated in locust eradication, killing a total of 1.6 million jin of locust nymphs. In addition to organizing local farmers to kill locusts, each prefecture and county that discovered locust nymphs also mobilized government cadres or farmers from neighboring areas to assist in locust eradication. The locust eradication work in the areas where locust nymphs have been discovered has now become a mass movement. 47,000 farmers in Peixian County, Shandong Province, have participated in locust eradication. Funan, Guanyun, and other counties have also put forward militant slogans such as "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, quickly eliminate locusts!" calling on farmers to "fight early, fight small, and fight them all!" to resolutely eliminate locust nymphs.

　　The Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee attach great importance to locust control work in the East China region. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government has dispatched 25 tons of "666" insecticide powder and 96 powder sprayers, sending special personnel to transport them to various parts of East China. The East China Military and Political Committee also issued an emergency directive on summer pest control, calling on the people's governments at all levels in East China to strive to achieve the following three points: First, in areas where pests have occurred or will occur, the local people's government should immediately establish a pest control headquarters to strengthen leadership and quickly eliminate pests. Second, adhere to the general policy of pest control of "prevention is more important than treatment," focusing on organizing manpower to kill pests, supplemented by pesticides and equipment. Third, in carrying out large-scale pest control campaigns, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of labor models and production activists, mobilize government cadres at all levels to participate, and conduct timely and necessary commendations and rewards among cadres and the masses. In areas where pest disasters have occurred, pest control work should be listed as the central task, and pests should be resolutely and cleanly eliminated.

　　皖北苏北山东部分地区
    农民组织起来灭蝗
    山东、苏北、皖北部分地区最近普遍发现蝗蝻，其中以皖北最严重。
    各地在发现蝗蝻后，都立即组织了专门领导扑蝗工作的机构。灌云县已在六月一日成立了指挥部，由该县县长亲任指挥，有关各区亦成立了大队部；淮阴专区人民政府并派出若干干部携带药械，前往灌云县协助扑蝗。泗洪县在发现蝗蝻后，也立即成立了灭蝗总队部，其下按区、乡等级分设灭蝗大队、中队、分队或小组。全县从五月十九日到六月二日已有十三万人参加灭蝗工作，共捕杀了蝗蝻一百六十万斤。各个发现蝗蝻的专区及县，除了组织当地的农民灭蝗外，并动员友邻地区的政府工作干部或农民前往协助灭蝗。各发现蝗蝻地区的灭蝗工作，现已形成为当地的一种群众性运动。山东沛县已有四万七千农民参加灭蝗工作。阜南、灌云等县并提出“保苗如保命，快把蝗虫消灭尽”等战斗性口号，号召农民要“打早、打小、打了！”坚决扑灭蝗蝻。
    中央人民政府及华东军政委员会都极重视华东地区的灭蝗工作。中央农业部已将杀蝗蝻用的“六六六”药粉二十五吨，喷粉器九十六架，派专人运往华东各地。华东军政委员会并发出夏季防虫紧急指示，号召华东各地人民政府努力做到以下三点：一，在已发生或将发生虫害地区，当地人民政府应即成立灭虫指挥部，加强领导，迅速捕灭虫害。二，坚持“防重于治”的灭虫总方针，以组织人力捕杀为主，药械为辅。三，各地在开展大规模的捕虫运动中，要大量培养劳动模范及生产积极分子，要动员各级政府干部参加，并在干部和群众中间进行及时必要的表扬与奖励。在已发生虫灾的地区，应将灭虫工作列为中心工作，坚决干净地消灭虫害。
