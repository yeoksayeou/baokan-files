Anci, Hebei Actively Prepares for Flood Control; Some Cadres' Complacency Should Be Corrected Immediately

Anci County, Hebei Province, is actively carrying out flood prevention preparations. During last year's flood season, the county suffered the destruction of over a hundred villages and the inundation of over 700,000 mu of fertile land. This year, in order to prevent floods early and ensure a bumper harvest of crops, in addition to completing the earthwork of the new northern levee, approximately 90 miles long, in the Yongding River flood area during the spring repairs, considerable progress has also been made in various specific flood prevention tasks.

The county flood control headquarters, the flood control sub-headquarters in each district, and the flood control committees in the 125 villages north of the levee have all been established. Under the leadership of the flood control organizations at all levels, the personnel required for flood control, such as levee patrolmen, flood workers, emergency rescue teams, and reserve teams, have all been determined and organized, with the vast majority of levee patrolmen being members of the Communist Party branch committees and the Communist Youth League branch committees. At present, the young and middle-aged people in 125 villages have generally been incorporated into emergency rescue teams.

In order to implement a system of graded responsibility, the county has allocated 48 county and district cadres, 14 levee patrolmen, and 66 flood workers to various sections based on the levee conditions and building equipment, assigning them tasks and construction sites. The 33 villages along the levee in the three flood areas have erected boundary markers at each construction section, clarifying responsibilities.

In order to supply the materials needed for flood control, the county has established nine key material preparation sites and prepared 180,000 bricks, half of which have been transported to the levee. The county headquarters has mobilized the masses to report the various reserve materials needed.

In order to promptly grasp the water situation and ensure smooth communication and timely information flow between higher and lower levels, the county has equipped itself with information reporters and made various material preparations; it has also decided to use radios to listen to the water situation regularly during the flood season. During the preparation period, the county conducted two levee inspections.

Although the county has made a lot of preparations, some lower-level cadres still have complacent thoughts, resulting in insufficient preparation of reserve materials. The county has now sent cadres to the districts to review grassroots organizations and help local cadres mobilize the masses to complete the reserve materials. It also plans to concentrate the flood workers, levee patrolmen, and flood control county and district cadres north of the levee for training in the near future. During the training, it is necessary to strengthen patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and to formulate flood control covenants at all levels, laying a solid foundation for this year's flood control work.

　　河北安次积极准备防汛
    部分干部麻痹思想应即纠正
    河北安次县积极进行防汛准备工作。该县在去年汛期中曾被水冲毁百余村庄，淹没了七十余万亩良田。今年为及早预防水患，保证农作物丰产，除在春修中已完成永定河汛区长约九十里的新北堤土工外，各项防汛的具体工作也已作出相当成绩。
    县防汛指挥部、各区防汛分部及大堤以北一百二十五个村的防汛委员会均已成立。在各级防汛机构的领导下，防汛时所需的巡堤员、汛工、抢险队、后备队等人员均已确定并组织就绪，巡堤员绝大部分为中共支部委员及青年团支部委员。现在一百二十五个村的青壮年，大体都编入了抢险队。
    为实现逐级专责制，该县已根据堤防情况和建筑物的设备，将四十八个县区干部，十四个巡堤员，六十六个汛工，分配在各段，交给了任务和工地。三个汛区的三十三个沿堤村各工段已插上界牌，明确责任。
    为供应防汛所需材料，该县已重点设置备料处九处，准备好十八万块砖，其中半数已运到堤上。所需各种后备料，县指挥部已发动群众自报。
    为及时掌握水情，保证交通联系及上下情报灵通，该县已配备了报讯员，作了各种物质准备；并已决定在汛期用收音机定时收听水情。在准备期间，该县曾作了两次堤防检查。
    该县虽已做了不少准备工作，但仍有部分下级干部存在着麻痹思想，致使后备料准备不够充分。该县现已派干部到区审查基层组织，帮助当地干部发动群众完成后备料。并准备在最近期间将大堤以北的汛工、巡堤员及防汛县区干部集中训练。在训练中要加强抗美援朝的爱国教育，定出各级防汛公约，给今年的防汛工作打下坚实基础。
