Regarding Art Propaganda Activities in Primary and Secondary Schools

	Xi Ren

Before liberation, art activities in Beijing's primary and secondary schools were mostly limited to drawing still life such as bananas and apples, or sketching landscapes outside the school. This was a reflection of the disconnect between education and the real struggles in old China's art teaching. After liberation, this situation changed. Students in Beijing's schools formed art groups, regularly copying many serial cartoons, satirical drawings, and propaganda posters that were closely linked to real struggles. During holidays or festivals, they conducted propaganda in urban areas and nearby rural villages, and their enthusiasm was very high. For example, students from the Central Primary School in the Second District of the city drew more than 1,000 pictures (mostly copies) during the spring break in just a few days. Later, even mass rallies in the district borrowed them. Students from the Central Primary School in the Sixth District spontaneously organized an art work team, with the school providing assistance. They also drew many pictures, and even some nearby stores borrowed the pictures to put up. Students from Hebei Provincial Normal School also used art to promote in the countryside, which was very popular with the masses, who even asked the students to paint the slogans of farmers engaging in sideline production on the walls. Students from Yu De Middle School promoted in the countryside, and when they left, the masses insisted on keeping their paintings. The students established a good relationship with the farmers, and after a long time, an old lady from the countryside even came to the school to visit them. This matter should attract the attention of specialized artists. Many of our art works cannot be widely popularized among the masses, but primary and secondary school teachers and students copy them, enlarge them, add colors, and take them to the masses, which expands the propaganda effect. Therefore, we should not underestimate the work of students' copying. In carrying out the art propaganda movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotic education, we should estimate their achievements and roles.

In addition to the above-mentioned activities, primary and secondary schools in Beijing also held two larger exhibitions this year. The works in the recent primary and secondary school anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea propaganda painting exhibition sponsored by the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union show that there has been great progress in school art creation, specifically manifested in: First, some works have begun to develop from the stage of copying to the stage of creation. The "Blood and Tears History of Pan La San" (themed on opposing the U.S. arming of Japan) created by the Art Group of Yu Ying Middle School, and the continuous paintings "Who are the Most Beloved People" created by Du Zhu of the Women's Affiliated Middle School of Normal University are examples of this type. Second, many works pay attention to combining with the real struggle, and there are many paintings expressing themes such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Third, in the exhibition, there are already a few creations reflecting school life, and they all have good political content. For example, the serial cartoon "Raise Vigilance and Not Be Tempted by Bad People" created collectively by students of the Municipal No. 1 Women's Middle School uses the true story of a female student in the school raising vigilance and exposing bad elements as the subject of the painting; Liu Changyi of Hui Wen Middle School painted "A Letter is a Bullet" to express the theme of young children writing letters of condolence to the volunteers. We do not object to students painting other subjects (whether political caricatures, propaganda paintings, or serial cartoons), but because students have less experience of life in other areas, they will inevitably feel difficulties in creation and can only "draw gourds according to the model" and copy as they are. If, in normal times, primary and secondary school art teachers pay attention to having students find educationally meaningful subjects from their real lives, then students can also create fresh and vivid pictures.

All of this should be given great importance by our professional art workers, because this is also a kind of mass art activity; if they are given appropriate guidance and this part of the force is utilized, it will certainly expand the effect of our political propaganda. Therefore, without hindering their study of other courses, our professional art workers should enthusiastically help and cultivate them; doing so will also strengthen the entire art work force.

　　关于中小学的美术宣传活动
        锡人
    解放以前北京市的中小学美术活动大都限止于画些香蕉苹果一类的静物或者是到校外去画些风景，这是旧中国教育和现实斗争脱节在美术教学上的反映。解放以后这种情况改变了，北京市的学生在学校中成立了美术小组，经常临摹许多和现实斗争结合的连环画、讽刺画和宣传画，在假期或节日中在城市和近郊农村中去进行宣传，他们的工作热情是很高的。举例说：市立二区中心小学学生在春假时，几天之内就画了一千多张画（临摹较多），以后连区里开群众大会也来借用；六区中心小学学生自动组织了美术工作队，学校进行帮助，也画了许多画，连附近有些商店也来借画去张贴，河北省立师范同学也用美术下乡宣传，群众非常欢迎，还请同学把当时农民进行副业生产的口号，画成墙壁画；育德中学同学下乡宣传，临走时群众硬要留下他们的画，学生和农民建立了感情，过了很久，还有从乡间来的老太太到学校来看望他们。这件事应该引起专门的美术家注意。我们有许多美术作品不能大量普及到群众中去，而中小学的教员和同学们把它临摹放大，加上颜色，拿到群众中去，这就扩大了宣传效果，因此不可轻视学生们的这种临摹画的工作。我们在进行抗美援朝爱国主义的美术宣传运动中，应该把他们的成绩和作用估计在内。
    北京市中小学的美术活动，除了上述的活动外，今年还举行了两次较大展览会，最近由中国教育工会北京市委员会主办的中小学抗美援朝宣传画展览会中的作品，可以看出学校美术创作有着很大进步，具体表现在：一、一部分作品已经开始从临摹的阶段发展到创作的阶段。育英中学美术小组创作的“潘腊三血泪史”（反对美国武装日本的主题），师大女附中杜洙创作《谁是可爱的人》的连续画就是属于这类的例子。二、许多作品注意做到和现实斗争结合，表现抗美援朝，镇压反革命等题材的画非常多。三，在展览会中已经有少数创作是反映了学校生活的创作，它们都有着很好的政治内容。举例来说：市立女一中学生集体创作“提高警惕，不受坏人的引诱”连环画，就是以学校的一个女同学提高警惕，检举了坏蛋的实事作为画的题材；汇文中学刘长沂画的“一封信就是一粒子弹”表现少年儿童队员向志愿军写慰问信的主题。我们不反对学生画其它方面的题材（不论政治讽刺画，宣传画或连环画）但是由于学生对其它方面的生活体验少，因此他们在创作上就必定感到困难，只能“依样画葫芦”，照样临摹。如果在平时，中小学的美术教师们注意要学生从他们的生活实际中，寻找能够反映有教育意义的题材，那么学生们同样也能创作出新鲜而生动的图画来。
    所有这一切，都应该引起我们的专业美术工作同志十分重视，因为这也是群众美术活动的一种；如果对他们进行适当指导，利用这部分力量，是一定能扩大我们政治宣传的效果的。因此，在不妨碍他们学习其他课程的条件下，我们的专业美术工作者应十分热情地对他们加以帮助和培养；这样做，同时也就加强了整个美术工作的力量。
