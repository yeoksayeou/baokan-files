Following the China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association's call on the first of this month for "Promoting Patriotic Pacts, Donating Airplanes and Artillery, and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel," all employees of the Tianjin Public Bus Company responded enthusiastically. As of noon on June 5th, they had already donated over five million yuan; at the same time, they added a new specific item to their patriotic pact: "Increase production and use excess bonus money to buy airplanes and artillery to support the front lines!"

The company employees' patriotic pact has already had a significant effect on improving operations. In May, the company averaged 313 kilometers per liter of engine oil, an increase of 50% compared to March before the patriotic pact was established; the time spent on vehicle repairs also decreased from an average of three minutes and forty-five seconds per vehicle per day in March to two minutes and ten seconds. The company's operating income in May exceeded the plan by 5.31%, with profits of over 190 million yuan.

Their patriotic pact was established on the basis of current affairs study. Because their patriotic pact was based on the different work characteristics of their unit, the content is concise, specific, and effective. For example, Zhao Zhongsheng's group on the first route of the outdoor vehicle workshop repeatedly found passengers losing money in the bus, which they felt would affect business. Therefore, after worker discussion, they stipulated in the patriotic pact clauses on paying attention to theft prevention and assisting the government in arresting thieves. On May 22nd, conductor Wu Yaowen caught a thief on the bus. As another example, Chu Jinming's group in the repair shop, in order to oppose the economic blockade of American imperialism, stipulated in the patriotic pact clauses on finding ways to use domestic products. After active experimentation by the entire group, they finally successfully used domestic expansion rings, and the efficiency was twice as high and the cost was reduced by 90% compared to using American expansion rings.

In order to ensure the implementation of the patriotic pact, the company's trade union helped each workshop establish inspection groups for the implementation of the patriotic pact, which inspect every ten days and solve problems in a timely manner. The company's trade union also conducts a key inspection directly with the company's administration once a month, summarizes it, reports to the workers, and then organizes the workers to discuss, modify, or supplement the original pact.

### 天津市公共汽车公司职工  修订补充爱国公约  增产捐献飞机大炮

　　天津市公共汽车公司职工
　  修订补充爱国公约  增产捐献飞机大炮
    当中国人民抗美援朝总会本月一日发出了“关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召”后，天津市公共汽车公司全体职工即热烈响应。至六月五日中午止，他们已捐献出五百余万元；同时又在爱国公约中添入了一项新的具体内容：“增加生产，用超额奖金来买飞机、大炮，支援前线！”
    该公司职工的爱国公约对改进业务已起了显著的作用。五月份该公司每公升机油平均行驶三百一十三公里，较三月份订立爱国公约前增加了百分之五十；坏车时间也由三月份平均每日每车三分四十五秒降低到二分十秒。该公司五月份营业收入超过计划百分之五点三一，盈利一亿九千余万元。
    他们的爱国公约，是在进行了时事学习的基础上订立的。因为他们的爱国公约是根据本单位不同的工作特点而提出，所以内容简明具体，行之有效。如外勤车间第一路赵忠盛小组，屡次发现乘客在车内丢钱，觉得这会影响营业。于是，经过工人讨论，即在爱国公约中规定了注意防盗、协助政府逮捕偷窃分子的条文。五月二十二日，售票员吴耀文就在车上捉到了一个偷窃分子。再如修理车间褚金铭小组为反对美帝国主义的经济封锁，在爱国公约中规定了设法使用国产品的条文。全组工人经过积极试验，终于成功地使用了国产品胀圈，并且比使用美国胀圈的效率增加了两倍，成本降低了百分之九十。
    为了保证爱国公约的实现，该公司工会帮助各车间成立了执行爱国公约的检查组，每十天检查一次，发现问题及时解决。该公司工会每月还配合公司行政直接进行一次重点检查，并作出总结向工人报告，然后组织工人进行讨论，修改或补充原有的公约。（新华社）
