    Our Great Motherland
    "Obey the allocation and build the motherland" has become the common slogan of graduates from various universities and colleges in New China. The phenomenon of students "graduating is unemployment" in the past reactionary rule is gone forever. This year's graduating students from universities and specialized courses have expressed their firm determination to obey the allocation of the People's Government and serve the construction of the motherland. This is the scene of fourth-year students from Peking University rushing to sign the letter of determination.
