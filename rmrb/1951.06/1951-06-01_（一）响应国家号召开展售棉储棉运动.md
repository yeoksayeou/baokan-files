　　(I) Responding to the National Call to Launch a Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign

　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has today issued "Instructions on Cotton Purchasing and Storing Work," and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has also issued instructions to Party committees at all levels for this purpose. This is a major event related to the national economy and the lives of the military and civilians, and should arouse the attention of the people of the whole country, especially the people in cotton-producing areas.

　　The problem that the Government Administration Council's instructions and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's call are meant to solve is how to enable cotton farmers who currently have cotton in storage to sell or store their cotton to economic organizations entrusted by the state under mutually beneficial conditions, in order to meet the urgent needs of the textile industry.

　　The People's Government has always attached importance to increasing cotton production and protecting the interests of cotton farmers. While implementing land reform, the Central People's Government adopted various protective policies for cotton farmers: such as the regulation of minimum cotton prices; opposition to speculative merchants suppressing prices; the state guaranteeing purchase at fixed prices; cotton field public grain not being higher than grain fields; timely supply of large amounts of fertilizer; pre-purchase of cotton, etc.; it is precisely because of these measures that cotton production increased and yielded a bumper harvest last year, and the cotton planting area has been expanded this year, and the lives of cotton farmers in the old liberated areas have been significantly improved.

　　In the past, our country was a country that relied on large amounts of foreign cotton imports for a long time. Although the Central People's Government has implemented various measures to support cotton planting for more than a year, and achieved a bumper harvest of cotton last year, due to the beginning of the improvement of the people's economy and the increase in the consumption of yarn and cloth, and the cotton production increase campaign is only in its first year, therefore, the cotton produced last year, in addition to wadding and hand spinning, to supply the entire needs of the national yarn factories, is still slightly insufficient. The American imperialists, in view of the shortage of raw cotton in our country, have adopted a blockade policy, not allowing our people to exchange their own products for foreign cotton, in an attempt to trap us. But it can be asserted that the imperialist blockade is bound to fail. The Chinese people do not want to rely on imperialist cotton. We have full confidence that, like grain, it will not be long before we will fully supply the needs of the whole country with our own cotton.

　　Cotton farmers across the country should know that if all the cotton produced last year, except for wadding and hand spinning, can be sold to the state, then the raw materials needed by the national yarn factories, although still short of some, are not far from being met. At present, cotton farmers do have a lot of cotton in storage, but recently the amount purchased by the state has been declining. If cotton farmers continue not to sell or sell less of their stored cotton, the result of reduced production by yarn factories will cause difficulties in clothing for the military and civilians across the country, and the policy of price stability may also be harmed. The Government Administration Council calls on cotton farmers across the country to sell their stored cotton that has not been used to the state at reasonable listed prices or to store it with the economic organizations entrusted by the state in kind or at a discounted price. This is not only beneficial to the state, and does not harm the cotton farmers, but also, precisely because it is beneficial to the people of the whole country, it is also beneficial to the cotton farmers.

　　"To get rich, plant cotton," this has become the slogan of many farmers. Planting cotton can indeed get rich at present, and the improvement of the lives of cotton farmers in the old liberated areas is already a fact. But historically, not all cotton planters could "get rich." On the contrary, like "cheap grain hurts farmers" and "bumper harvests become disasters," the situation of cotton farmers losing money in cotton harvests was a common phenomenon in the era of reactionary rule. Only in the era of the People's Government, because the land ownership system has been reformed, and policies to protect farmers and cotton farmers have been implemented, can we avoid "bumper harvests becoming disasters" and achieve getting rich by planting cotton. Therefore, the basic truth is that with the People's Government, with the people's "country," cotton farmers can get rich. Without the victory of the revolution, without land reform, without the establishment of the People's Government, cotton farmers would never be able to get rich. So, "to get rich, plant cotton," this sentence only says one side of the matter; the true and basic side is that protecting the country is the only way to get rich. Party organizations, people's governments and people's organizations in cotton-producing areas should explain this truth to cotton farmers, so that under the understanding that getting rich requires protecting the country, they will voluntarily, rather than forcibly, sell their stored cotton to the state at reasonable listed prices. Under the slogan of "love the country and get rich, plant more cotton," expand cotton fields, cultivate intensively, and increase cotton production.

　　The state's trade departments, cooperatives and People's Bank should purchase cotton at reasonable listed prices, and should adopt storage methods that are beneficial to farmers to absorb cotton farmers' cotton savings. The working history of our national trading company is short, and there are still many shortcomings in the work, and the goods needed by cotton farmers cannot be fully supplied, but in the future, we must make the greatest efforts to supply the needs of cotton farmers so that the cotton purchase task can be successfully completed.

　　Most cotton-producing areas have undergone land system reform, and the old liberated areas are where cotton farmers have more cotton in storage, so the awareness of the farmers is very high. As long as local Party organizations, people's governments and people's organizations work together, the task of purchasing cotton can be completed. Let the imperialists blockade! We believe that cotton farmers across the country will respond to the call of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government with patriotic cotton selling competitions, and answer the imperialist blockade by expanding cotton fields, cultivating intensively, and striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

### （一）响应国家号召开展售棉储棉运动

　　（一）响应国家号召开展售棉储棉运动
    中央人民政府政务院今日发出了“关于购棉、储棉工作的指示”，中共中央亦为此向各级党委发出了指示。这是关系国家经济和军民生活的大事，应当引起全国人民，尤其是产棉区人民的重视。
    政务院这个指示和中共中央这个号召所要解决的问题，是如何使目前有存棉的棉农在公私两利的条件下把存棉售予或储存在国家委托的经济机关，以应纺织工业的急迫的需要。
    人民政府从来就是重视棉花增产和棉农的利益的。在实行土地改革的同时，中央人民政府对棉农采取了种种保护政策：如最低棉价的规定；反对投机商人压价；国家保证以定价收购；棉田公粮不高于粮田；适时大量供应肥料；预购棉花等等；正由于这些措施，使去年棉花增产丰收，今年棉田面积扩大，老解放区的棉农生活显著提高。
    我国过去是一个长期依靠大量外棉入口的国家，中央人民政府一年余以来，虽然实行了各种扶助植棉的措施，达到了去年棉花增产丰收，但是由于人民经济的开始好转，纱布消费的增加，而棉花增产运动还仅仅是第一年，因此，去年所产的棉花，除去絮棉手纺，以之供应全国纱厂的全部需要，仍有少许不足。美帝国主义者针对我原棉不足的情况，已经采取了封锁政策，不让我国人民以自己的生产品去交换外棉，企图以此困扰我们。但是可以断言，帝国主义的封锁一定要失败，我国人民不想依靠帝国主义的棉花，我们有完全的自信，象粮食一样，不需多久，我们将以自己的棉花充分供给全国的需要。
    全国棉农应该知道：去年所产的棉花，除去絮花手纺以外，如能全部卖给国家，则全国纱厂所需的原料，虽然还缺少许，但已相差不远。目前棉农手内是确有不少存棉的，但是近来国家购得的数量则日渐下降，如果棉农的存棉继续不卖或少卖，则纱厂减产的结果，将使全国军民的衣着发生困难，物价稳定的政策也可能受到损害。政务院号召全国棉农将藏而未用的存棉按照合理的牌价售给国家或向国家所委托的经济机关作实物或折价存储，这不但有利于国家，无损于棉农，而且正因为这是有利于全国人民的，因此也是有利于棉农的。
    “要发家，种棉花”，这已经成为许多农民的口号。目前种棉花确实可以发家，老解放区产棉区农民生活的提高，已是事实。但历史上并不是种棉花者都能“发家”，相反的，象“谷贱伤农”、“丰收成灾”一样，棉花丰收，棉农赔本的情况，倒是反动统治时代的一般现象。仅仅在人民政府时代，因为土地所有制度改革了，保护农民、保护棉农的政策实施了，才能避免“丰收成灾”，达到种棉发家。因此基本的真理是有了人民政府，有了人民的“国家”，棉农才能发家。没有革命的胜利，没有土地改革，没有人民政府的成立，棉农绝难发家。所以“要发家，种棉花”，这句话，仅仅说了事情的一面；真理和基本的一面，则是保国才能发家。产棉区的党组织、人民政府和人民团体应该向棉农解释这个真理，使他们在发家必须保国的认识下，不是强迫的，而是自愿的将存棉在合理牌价下卖给国家。在“爱国发家，多种棉花”的口号下，扩大棉田，精耕细作，增加棉花产量。
    国家的贸易部门，合作社和人民银行，应该以合理的牌价来收购棉花，应该以有利于农民的存储办法来吸收棉农的棉花储蓄。我们国家贸易公司的工作历史短，工作还有很多缺点，棉农所需的货物还不能充分供应，但是今后必须以最大的努力来供应棉农需要，使购棉任务顺利完成。
    大部产棉区都经过了土地制度的改革，棉农存棉较多的正是老解放区，所以农民的觉悟是很高的。只要地方党组织、人民政府和人民团体一齐努力，购棉的任务是可以完成的，让帝国主义者去封锁吧！我们相信全国棉农，将以爱国主义的售棉竞赛，来响应中央人民政府政务院的号召，以扩大棉田，精耕细作，争取今年棉花丰收，来回答帝国主义的封锁。
