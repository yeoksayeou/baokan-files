　　Heroes on the Transportation Line
　　Boning
　　In Korea, I came into contact with the logistics units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. What was the composition of this unit? They were workers fresh from factories from all directions; peasants who had just put down their hoes after being liberated; students who had just left school; and also cadres from government offices, doctors, nurses... They all deeply loved peace, and volunteered to come to Korea to extinguish the flames of aggression burning at the doorstep of their motherland. It was these people who, under difficult conditions, transported the war materials needed to the front lines, and transported the wounded from the front lines to the rear. They ensured that the front lines were adequately supplied, constantly improved transportation efficiency, and ensured that the People's Volunteer Army annihilated the enemy time and time again.
            Rolling Down "Snow Cold Ridge"
　　During the campaign to annihilate the enemy at Changjin Lake on the eastern front last winter, in order to ensure the supply of the combat troops, it was necessary to transport grain through Snow Cold Ridge and Dead Eagle Ridge, which were 1,900 meters above sea level and twenty to thirty *li* long. In the climate of thirty degrees below zero, the ice and snow were four to five *chi* deep, the mountains were steep, and the roads were slippery, making it impossible for cars to pass. But the war did not allow us to wait. The front needed grain, so we had to carry it on our backs. But even walking was extremely difficult. Our heroic male and female logistics personnel carried grain on their backs and climbed the mountains step by step in the biting cold wind. Their clothes were soaked with sweat, their eyebrows were covered with white frost, and when they were unbearably thirsty, they grabbed a handful of snow and stuffed it into their mouths, and continued to climb. Every step forward required great perseverance and determination. It was really not easy! But they finally climbed to the top of the mountain. But going down the mountain was even more difficult than going up, and there was simply no way to walk. But the difficulties did not defeat them, and they unhesitatingly tied the grain to their bodies and rolled down. Branches and rocks tore their clothes and pierced their skin, and the wounds, covered with ice and snow, stung like needles. In this way, they completed the transportation tasks time and time again.
            Heroic Drivers
　　There are too many stories about our heroic drivers to tell.
　　Xu Anguo was transporting wounded soldiers to a certain place when enemy planes discovered them on the road. The aerial bandits dropped flares and carried out low-altitude strafing and bombing. He calmly used the light of the flares to drive the car safely out of the danger zone. On another occasion, the car was damaged by enemy planes, with four wheels and the engine cover destroyed, which he repaired overnight, but unfortunately it was discovered and hit by enemy planes again the next day. Xu Anguo immediately braved the enemy's strafing to run down and use soil and snow to put out the flames. His clothes and hat were burned. He had not eaten or rested for two days. How could he bear it? He fainted. But he thought, "As long as I'm alive, I can't just watch the car burn." At this time, the enemy planes were still circling and strafing, and he struggled to his feet, using all his strength to finally put out the fire on the car. He did not rest, and in two days he repaired the car again, accepted a new mission, and went to the front.
　　Such stories are truly too numerous to mention. Driver Liang Jimin was wounded in the buttocks, but he still took the lead in rescuing four cars and 350 bags of white flour. Co-driver Zhou Yunke rescued a car that was hit by an enemy plane, and the oil drum in the carriage exploded, blowing him from the driver's seat. But he immediately went to rescue the things in the house, and a bomb stunned him and knocked him to the ground. When he woke up, he still rescued the entire class's luggage and the landlord's clothes. Driver Lu Jingquan rolled down a ravine more than ten *zhang* deep and rescued two drivers who had overturned and fallen into the ravine. ...
            Attacking Aerial Bandits
　　If, in the early stages of the war, our logistics personnel lacked effective ways to deal with enemy planes, then the situation is now greatly changed. We have been tempered by the war, and the power of enemy planes has been greatly weakened.
　　At first, enemy planes randomly dropped time bombs at stations and on transportation lines, which was indeed very annoying. You couldn't tell when the bomb would explode, which greatly affected our traffic and work. But now that we are familiar with and have mastered it, it is also powerless.
　　When the Sixth Brigade of Changbei Volunteer Laborers was performing a task at a certain station, enemy planes dropped more than 100 time bombs near the train cars loaded with large quantities of gasoline and supplies. The brigade commander Liu Lilin, instructor Liu Dexi, He Wenrui, Hou Qiwu, and squad leader Yu Quanyi, etc., led more than 100 laborers and two nurses in rescuing all the supplies amidst the constant explosions of bombs. They explored the performance and explosion patterns of the time bombs, jumping up and down, lying down and getting up, and no one was injured.
　　A warehouse of a certain unit was strafed and bombed by three enemy planes. After the enemy planes flew away, everyone was busy sorting out and checking the bombed items. Ma Guoyan suddenly found a time bomb on the side of the warehouse. In order to protect the safety of the warehouse, he unhesitatingly picked up the bomb and threw it 100 meters away from the warehouse. His spirit of self-sacrifice moved everyone. When the stationmaster wanted to give him a material reward, he refused. He said: "What does it matter if I sacrifice one person? If the warehouse is blown up, not only will the people's property suffer great losses, but it will also affect the victory at the front."
　　At 11:00 a.m. on March 21, Zhao Baoqiu, a driver of a certain unit, and his assistant Zeng Xinren were driving to a certain place when they encountered an attack by two enemy planes. The two of them bravely fought back against the enemy planes with rifles, and shot down one enemy plane with only a dozen bullets. The other plane was also frightened and fled.
　　At about 10:00 p.m. on March 24, Zheng Youshan, deputy squad leader, and soldiers Song Ruojin and Bao Jiaxian of a certain logistics unit were on air watch duty in a certain place when they encountered two enemy planes strafing in the air. Zheng Youshan and others calmly and bravely fought back with machine guns and rifles, and as a result shot down an enemy heavy bomber, killing three pilots.
　　In this way, we defeated the enemy planes, making them afraid to recklessly fly around at low altitudes and in the ravines. On the Korean battlefield, although enemy planes are rampant, they appear very powerless in the face of the heroic and tempered Chinese and Korean people.

### 运输线上的英雄们

　　运输线上的英雄们
　　伯宁
    在朝鲜，我接触了中国人民志愿军的后勤部队。这一部队的组成成份是怎样的呢？他们是来自四面八方的刚走出工厂的工人；刚放下锄头的翻身农民；刚走出学校的学生；还有机关干部、医生、护士……他们都是酷爱和平，为了扑灭烧到祖国大门口的侵略凶焰，志愿到朝鲜来的。就是这些人，在艰苦的条件下，把战争所需物资运到了前线，从前线把伤员运到后方。他们保证了前线供应充足，不断地提高了运输效率，保证人民志愿军一次又一次地歼灭了敌人。
            滚下“雪寒岭”
    在去冬东线长津湖歼灭战进行的时候，为保证作战部队的供应，须要通过拔海一千九百公尺、上下二三十里的雪寒岭和死鹰岭去运粮。零下三十度的气候，冰雪深及四五尺，山陡路滑，汽车是无法通行的。而战争不容我们等待。前方需要粮食，只好用人背。但人行也是万分困难的。我们英雄的男女后勤人员们，他（她）们背着粮食，在刺骨的寒风里，一步一步地爬越山岭。衣服被汗浸透了，眉上挂着白霜，渴得没办法的时候，抓一把雪塞在嘴里，又继续往上爬。每前进一步，都须要极大的毅力和决心。真不容易呀！可是终于爬到山顶上了。但下山比上山更困难些，根本就没法走。但困难没有难倒他们，他们毫不犹豫地把粮食绑在身上往下滚，滚到能爬的地方就爬，不能爬了就再滚。树枝和石块挂破了衣服，刺破了皮肤，伤口沾上冰雪，和针刺一样地痛。就这样，他们还是一次一次地完成了运输任务。
            英雄的司机们
    我们英雄的司机们的故事是多得说不完的。
    徐安国运伤员到某地，路上被敌机发现。空中强盗们投下照明弹，进行低飞扫射和轰炸。他沉着地借着照明弹的光亮，开着车子安全地冲出了危险区。又一次，车子被敌机打坏了四个车轮和机关盖，他一夜就修好了，但第二天又不幸被敌机发觉打着了。徐安国立即冒着敌机的扫射跑下来，用土和雪去扑灭火焰。衣服、帽子都被烧着了。他已经两天没吃东西、没有休息了，这怎能支持呢？他晕倒了。但他想到：“只要我还活着，就不能眼看着叫车子烧完。”这时，敌机仍在盘旋扫射，他挣扎着站起来，用全身力量终于将车上的火扑灭。他没有休息，两天功夫又把车子修好了，又接受了新的任务到了前方。
    这样的故事真是举不胜举的。司机梁济民臀部被打伤了，他还是带头抢出汽车四辆，白面三百五十袋。副驾驶员周云科抢救一辆被敌机打着的汽车，车厢油桶爆炸了，他从司机座上被轰下来。但他立刻又去抢救屋子里的东西，一颗炸弹将他震昏，倒在地上。醒来后，他还是将全班行李和房东的衣物抢救出来。司机陆景泉，滚下十余丈深的山涧，抢救出翻车坠涧的两个司机。……
            打击空中强盗
    如果说，战争初期我们的后勤人员因对敌机还缺乏积极的应付办法的话，那么现在的情况是大大改变了。我们已从战争中锻炼了出来，敌机的威力已大大削弱了。
    开初，敌机在车站、运输线上乱丢定时炸弹，这确实是很讨厌的。你说不清那个炸弹在什么时候爆炸，这很影响了我们的交通和工作。但现在我们熟习和掌握了它，它也是无能为力了。
    昌北志愿民工第六大队，在某车站执行任务时，敌机投下一百多枚定时炸弹；落在满载大批汽油、物资的车皮附近。该队大队长刘立林、教导员刘德喜、和文瑞、侯齐武及小队长于全义等，分头带民工一百多人、护士两名，在不断的炸弹爆炸声中，把全部物资抢出来了。他们摸索着定时弹的性能和爆炸的规律，跳起卧倒，卧倒跳起，没有一人受伤。
    某部仓库遭受了三架敌机的扫射轰炸，在敌机飞走后，大家都忙着整理检查被炸的东西。马国彦突然发现仓库侧边有一颗定时炸弹，他为了保护仓库安全，毫不犹豫地把炸弹抱起来，扔在距仓库一百米以外的地方。他这种自我牺牲的精神，感动了大家。在站长要给他物质奖励时，他拒绝了。他说：“牺牲我一个算啥，要是把仓库炸了，不但人民的财产遭受很大损失，还要影响前方的胜利。”
    三月二十一日上午十一时，某部汽车司机赵宝邱和助手曾新仁，行车到某地时，遭遇两架敌机的袭击。他们两个英勇地以步枪对敌机还击，只用了十余发子弹，便击落敌机一架。另一架也吓得逃跑了。
    三月二十四日晚十时许，后勤部队某部副班长郑攸山、战士宋若进、包家贤，在某地担任对空监视的任务，遇敌机两架临空扫射。郑攸山等即沉着勇敢地以机枪、步枪回击，结果击落敌重轰炸机一架，驾驶员三名丧命。
    就这样，我们战胜了敌机，使敌机不敢再毫无忌惮地在低空和山沟里窜来窜去了。在朝鲜战场上，敌机虽然猖獗，但在英勇的百炼成钢的中朝人民面前，却显得非常没有力量。
