　　Since the suppression of reactionary secret societies across the country, great achievements have been made. In areas where suppression has been carried out earnestly, reactionary secret society organizations have been shattered, most of the reactionary ringleaders have been registered, some of the most heinous ringleaders have been executed, and many deceived followers, after propaganda and education and accusations against the crimes of the reactionary leaders, have begun to ideologically break with the reactionary feudal organizations and have requested to withdraw from the societies. However, some die-hard ringleaders who make anti-people activities their profession, as well as escaped reactionary leaders, continue to engage in destructive activities of a last-ditch nature in various ways. Various localities have discovered that reactionary leaders are secretly carrying out activities to restore and develop reactionary feudal organizations. The "Xin" Character Main Branch of Yiguandao in Shanxi Province sent people from Taigu County to Quwo, Yuncheng, and Linfen in southern Shanxi to develop the organization; recently, more than fifty followers have been developed in Quwo. In Dai County, Shanxi Province, three appointed preachers were found to have taken over the positions of the arrested leaders, and so-called "three reviews and four investigations" reactionary documents were discovered, which proves that the Yiguandao reactionary leaders are attempting to reorganize the suppressed organizations. Some escaped reactionary leaders in the province have contacted Yiguandao in Chengdu, Luoyang, and other places, and brought back "instructions" from Chengdu: "January, February, and March are times of tribulation; those who waver will be shot, and those who do not waver will pass the test, and the Way will be clear in April, May, and June." Reactionary secret societies in the Northwest region have proposed to carry out activities in areas where land reform has not been carried out, and have proposed to develop organizations within our agencies and use cadres to seize weapons. A altar master in Xi'an has made a plan to develop 1,500 followers and set up 50 temples. In many places, reactionary secret societies have changed their appearance in order to obscure the vision of the People's Government. The "Red Lantern Sect," "Big Sword Society," "Xiantian Dadao," "Yu Huang Dao," "Zhongyong Dao," "Zhongcheng Dadao," "Shiquan Dao," "Bai Dui Dao," and "Zhen Tiandao" recently discovered in the Southwest and East China regions are all aliases of "Yiguandao." The "Yiguandao" in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong Province, has been renamed "Fayi Dadao" or "Fayi Dadao," and the large and small altars have been changed to "General Branches" and "Branches," and the reactionary leaders have been renamed "Manager Mr."; and they have dug underground tunnels or opened up walls to facilitate reactionary activities. According to confessions of arrested leaders, there are underground rooms and tunnels in nine places in Zhanhua, Bin County, and other places; the leaders hide in the underground rooms to direct destructive activities. They also proposed to absorb cadres of the People's Government and their relatives and friends into the society.

    In order to prevent their reactionary organizations from being exposed, reactionary secret society leaders not only use cruel beatings to test whether ordinary followers are firm, but also often use the method of "killing people to silence them." For example, after the suppression of Yiguandao in Tianjin, Wang Zhenshan, the "Pu altar" "predecessor," fled to the Siping area of ​​Northeast China and colluded with preacher Cao Haiyan and others. When they were discussing and deploying counter-revolutionary activities, Cao's mother-in-law (a non-follower) heard about it. Fearing that she would expose the secret, Wang and others used the excuse of "stealing the Way" and "hindering the Way's affairs" to beat her to death. The criminals beat fifteen followers during the testing, and the nose of a young follower of more than ten years old was beaten down. Li Zhao, the head of "Ming Fo Dao" in Baozhuyingzi Village, Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, summoned followers to deploy anti-people activities, which was seen by her father-in-law, Li Chunshan. In order to keep the secret, she planned to kill her father-in-law with her husband Li Yushan (a follower) and follower Li Yutian. On the one hand, she prepared poison, coffins, filial piety clothes, etc., and on the other hand, she spread rumors: "The 'Ming Buddha' wants the old man (referring to her father-in-law) to return to heaven." She put the poison in the rice and coaxed Li Chunshan to eat it, and Li Yutian held him and did not allow him to move. Seeing that the situation was not good, Li Chunshan pretended to faint. When Li Zhao and others were preparing to put him in the coffin, some neighbors came. Li Chunshan immediately sat up and said, "I am not dead." Li Zhao deliberately shouted, "The 'corpse' is startled, hurry up and hit it!" Then she broke her father-in-law's head in five or six places with an iron shovel, and forcibly put him into the coffin, attempting to bury him quickly. When Han Guangtian (Li Chunshan's adopted son), a member of the Communist Party branch of the village, arrived to inquire, he heard a moan from the coffin and a slight call for "Guangtian save me." Han immediately led the militiamen to open the coffin, rescued Li Chunshan, and arrested all the murderers.

    Another new conspiracy of reactionary secret societies is to step up colluding with all counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage our various tasks, organize followers to practice martial arts, and prepare for armed riots. After Zhang Guangbi's son, the chief culprit of Yiguandao, participated in the joint meeting of Chinese and American agents in Taiwan, he strengthened the connection between reactionary secret societies and all counter-revolutionary elements and actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities. Li Pengxian, the head of Yiguandao in Fuling County, eastern Sichuan, organized scattered bandits, reactionary landlords, etc. to carry out armed riots, and committed rape, arson, and murder against the local people. According to statistics, the criminals killed our cadres and peasant activists and robbed a large amount of public grain. The "Daotuhui" in Guanxian County, western Sichuan, organized bandits, reactionary leaders, reactionary landlords, etc. to form the "Sichuan People's Self-Defense Army," preparing to openly carry out armed riots. In cities in Yunnan, southern Sichuan, and other places, it was discovered that reactionary secret societies had infiltrated our factories and enterprises, attempting to carry out sabotage when the opportunity arose. Li Guangwu (a Central Bureau of Statistics agent), the head of "Wuji Dao" in Gaolan, Gansu Province, Northwest China, and others, carried out armed disturbances in Anning District, Gaolan, and declared that they would "capture Lanzhou" within three days, robbing people's property everywhere; they were later wiped out by our army. Escaped reactionary leaders in Shanxi Province colluded with reactionary landlords to plan to settle accounts with the peasants, sabotaging peasant production. According to statistics from sixty-nine villages in Guoxian County, the province, there have been 152 cases of Yiguandao leaders colluding with reactionary landlords to settle accounts with the peasants.

    Reactionary secret society leaders also used poisoning to kill people and cadres. Poisoning incidents have occurred in Southwest, North China, and other regions. Li Shaofu, a Yiguandao preacher in Tianquan County, Xikang Province, Southwest China, poisoned the kitchen of the Third District People's Government in the county. When the Hedong Village of the First District of Fumin County, Yunnan Province, held a farmers' meeting of five villages, militiamen bought by Gao Yang, the head of the "Baiyang Sect," poisoned the meeting, causing more than 30 of our cadres and peasants to be poisoned. In the Suidong area of ​​Suiyuan Province, North China, incidents of reactionary secret societies releasing poisonous gas bombs occurred one after another. Those who were poisoned were either drunk or unconscious.

    The conspiracy of reactionary secret societies to carry out counter-revolutionary activities is becoming more and more vicious. The people's governments and the broad masses of people in various localities must be highly vigilant to avoid being poisoned by them.

　　漏网的反动会道门头子的新阴谋
    朱波
    全国各地取缔反动会道门以来，已有很大成绩。凡是经过认真取缔的地区，反动会道门组织都被打得四分五裂，反动会道首大部进行了登记，一些罪大恶极的首要分子被处决，很多被骗入道的道徒，经过宣传教育及控诉反动道首的罪恶以后，开始在思想上与反动封建组织划清界线，纷纷要求退道。但仍有一些以反人民为职业的首恶分子，以及漏网的反动道首继续以各种方式进行垂死挣扎性质的破坏活动。各地均发现反动道首秘密进行恢复与发展反动封建组织的活动。山西省一贯道“信字总柜”由太谷县派人赴晋南曲沃、运城、临汾等地发展组织；近来在曲沃已发展了五十多个道徒。该省代县发现三个领命点传师接任被捕道首的职务，并且发现了所谓“三审四查”的反动文件，这是一贯道反动道首企图重新整顿被取缔后的组织的证明。该省潜逃的一些反动道首，已与成都、洛阳等地的一贯道取上联系，并由成都带回“训示”：“一、二、三月是劫难时期，对动摇者要枪毙，不动摇者即考过去了，四、五、六月道就明了。”西北地区的反动会道门提出要到没有进行土地改革的地区进行活动，提出向我机关内部发展组织，利用干部夺取武装。西安市一个坛主订出计划，要发展一千五百个道徒，设五十个佛堂。很多地方的反动会道门为模糊人民政府的视线而改头换面。西南、华东地区最近发现的“红灯教”、“大刀队”、“先天大道”、“玉皇道”、“中庸道”、“中诚大道”、“十全道”、“白队道”、“真天道”等，都是“一贯道”的化名。山东省惠民专区的“一贯道”改为“法一大道”或“法义大道”，将大小坛口改为“总支”、“分支”，反动道首则改称为“经理先生”；并挖地下道，或挖通墙壁，以便于进行反动活动。据被捕道首供称，在沾化、滨县等地有九个地方有地下室和地道；道首就藏在地下室内指挥破坏活动。他们并提出要吸收人民政府干部及干部的亲友入道。
    反动会道首为使其反动组织不致暴露，不仅以残酷的毒打来考验一般道徒是否坚定，而且常常采用“杀人灭口”的办法。如天津取缔一贯道后，“仆坛”“前人”王振山潜逃至东北四平一带，和点传师曹海岩等人勾结活动。他们在讨论布置反革命活动时，被曹的岳母（非道徒）听到。王匪等怕她暴露秘密，就以“偷道”、“妨碍道务”为词，将她活活打死。该犯等在考验道徒时，有十五个道徒被打伤，其中有一个十余岁的小道徒的鼻子都被打塌了。辽西省阜新县宝柱营子村“明佛道”头子李赵氏召集道徒布置反人民活动时，被她公爹李春山看见了。她为了保守秘密，便和她丈夫李玉山（道徒）及道徒李玉田等，计划将她公爹害死。她一面准备了毒药、棺材、孝衣等，一面又造谣说：“‘明佛爷’要老头子（指她公爹）归天了。”她把毒药放在饭里哄李春山吃下去，由李玉田抱住不许走动。李春山见势不妙，就假装昏倒，李赵氏等正准备装殓时，有些邻居来了，李春山马上坐起来说：“我没有死。”李赵氏却故意喊叫：“‘尸’惊了，赶快打！”便用铁锨把她公爹的头打破了五、六处，并强行入棺，企图迅速葬埋。当该村中共支部委员韩广田（李春山的义子）赶到询问时，听到棺内有呻吟声，还轻微地呼叫“广田救命”。韩即带领民兵打开棺材，救出李春山，并将全体凶手逮捕。
    反动会道门另一新阴谋，是加紧勾结一切反革命分子，破坏我各种工作，组织道徒练武，准备进行武装暴乱。一贯道罪魁张光璧的儿子在台湾参加中、美特工联席会议以后，更加强了反动会道门和一切反革命分子的联系，积极进行反革命活动。川东地区涪陵县一贯道头子李蓬仙等，组织散匪反动地主等进行武装暴乱，对当地人民施行奸淫烧杀。据统计，该犯等并曾杀害我干部、农民积极分子抢劫大批公粮。川西灌县“道徒会”组织土匪、反动道首、反动地主等成立了“四川人民自卫军”，准备公开进行武装暴乱。在云南、川南等地的城市，发现反动会道门打入我工厂企业部门，企图待机进行破坏。西北区甘肃省皋兰一带的“无极道”头子李广武（中统特务）等，在皋兰安宁区进行武装骚乱，并扬言在三日内“攻下兰州”，到处抢劫人民的财物；后经我军剿灭。山西省漏网的反动道首，勾结反动地主有计划地向农民进行倒算，破坏农民生产。据该省崞县六十九个村的统计，一贯道首勾结反动地主向农民倒算事件已发生一百五十二起。
    反动会道首并以放毒来杀害人民和干部。西南、华北等地区均发生放毒事件。西南区西康省天全县一贯道点传师李绍富在该县三区人民政府厨房放毒。云南省富民县第一区河东村召开五个村的农民大会时，被“白洋教”头子高杨氏收买的民兵放毒，使我干部、农民三十余人中毒。华北区绥远省绥东地区，先后发生反动会道门放毒气弹的事件，受毒者轻者如醉，重者昏迷不醒。
    反动会道门进行反革命活动的阴谋，愈来愈恶毒了。各地人民政府及广大人民群众，必须高度警惕起来，以免遭受他们的毒害。
