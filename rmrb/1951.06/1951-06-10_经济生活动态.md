　　152 Mutual Aid Teams in Northern Jiangsu and Henan Provinces Challenge 47 Mutual Aid Teams in Xingping County

　　Five mutual aid teams led by Chen Lianzhang, a famous agricultural labor model in Northern Jiangsu Province, and 147 mutual aid teams in Lushan County, Henan Province, recently formulated summer production plans to challenge 47 mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province.

　　The terms of challenge and acceptance by the five mutual aid teams led by Chen Lianzhang are as follows: Each team guarantees to complete wheat harvesting within 13 days and transplant rice seedlings in paddy fields and wheat fields within 18 days. Select and reserve fine varieties of wheat and barley, ensuring separate harvesting, threshing, and storage. Strengthen militia patrols and guard duty, strictly prevent spies, fire, and theft, and protect the wheat harvest. After the agricultural tax is levied, guarantee full payment within one day.

　　The 147 mutual aid teams in Lushan County proposed in their letter of acceptance: Each team will implement field selection of seeds, select and reserve fine wheat varieties such as short awn and red earthworm, and ensure that all fine varieties are used for wheat planting this autumn. After the wheat harvest begins, guarantee completion of harvesting and threshing within six days. After the summer agricultural tax is levied, pay the standard grain in full. Team members will also actively participate in wheat protection teams to protect the wheat harvest and prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries. Complete summer planting within five days, ensuring one plowing, two harrowings, five carts of manure each time, and carry out seed soaking and seed dressing to prevent pests and diseases.

　　Hunan's Yang Tiancai and Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Teams Complete Challenge Plan to Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team

　　Yang Tiancai, a famous labor model in Hunan Province, and the Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Team in the suburbs of Hengyang City, who challenged the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, have completed their spring production challenge plan. Yang Tiancai's cotton fields have been generally plowed once and harrowed four times; the amount of fertilizer applied to the cotton fields exceeded the original plan by 40 percent. Before sowing cotton, he carefully selected 103 jin of "Dezi cotton" seeds, all of which were treated with medicine. The early cotton has now emerged three to four inches. He is actively rushing to harvest summer crops and rush to plant summer fields.

　　The Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Team's spring challenge plan was completed after unremitting struggle against continuous rain.

　　Xinjiang Military Region Participates in Agricultural Production; Troops Mostly Complete Planting Plan of 800,000 Mu

　　The People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region's plan for troops participating in agricultural production to plant 800,000 mu has now been mostly completed. Currently, in the vast fields north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, early planted cotton seeds have sprouted and grown leaves, and wheat seedlings are up to five inches tall. The participating commanders and fighters are fully preparing for irrigation and weeding. In order to adapt the strong labor force to large-scale collective agricultural production, the Xinjiang Military Region has concentrated the land planted this year more than last year. Each company organizes production groups for irrigation, plowing, harrowing, and leveling according to the needs of cultivation, achieving rational use of labor. Due to the adoption of new agricultural tools and new farming methods, the efficiency of cultivation has been greatly improved, and a large number of laborers can be drawn out to engage in building barracks, factories, and constructing huge water conservancy projects, etc.; At the same time, it has also promoted the Uygur farmers in the resident areas to start fertilizing, harrowing, and using drills for planting. In the vast fields, the cultural and entertainment activities of the troops are very active. Every evening after work, the sound of gongs and drums rings out, and the soldiers either dance Uygur dances or watch new movies screened in the field.

　　"Caustic Soda" Should Not Be Mixed with Dry Manure

　　According to farmers' reports, in the suburbs of Beijing, some private manure merchants mix "caustic soda" (residue after processing vegetable oil) into manure slurry and dry it to make dry manure. Farmers suffer great losses after using it.

　　The composition of "caustic soda" contains vegetable oil, soap, and a small amount of caustic soda, with an alkalinity of more than ten degrees (generally, plants cannot survive if the soil pH is above nine). It does not contain the fertilizer components needed by plants. Mixing it with dry manure accelerates the decomposition and loss of effective nitrogen in the manure. When applied to the field, it corrodes the roots and stems of crops, causing great harm and even death, and it is difficult to grow other crops afterward. The reasons for the occurrence of this unreasonable thing are approximately as follows: (1) Some manure merchants want to adulterate the manure and deceive farmers in order to make huge profits. (2) Most farmers believe that the darker the color of the dry manure, the better the quality of the manure and the greater the fertilizer effect when used in the ground. Manure merchants take advantage of this point and add some alkaline substances to deepen the color of the organic matter. (3) Most farmers mistakenly believe that "oil" is a necessary fertilizer for plants, so they associate the use of "oil residue" with fertilizer. This is incorrect, because the chemical composition of vegetable oil does not contain the nutrients needed by crops.

    苏北河南一百五十二个互助组向兴平县四十七个互助组应战
    苏北区著名农业劳动模范陈连章所领导的五个互助组和河南省鲁山县的一百四十七个互助组，最近分别订出夏季生产计划，向陕西省兴平县四十七个互助组应战。
    陈连章所领导的五个互助组的应战和挑战条件是：各组保证十三天内完成麦收，十八天内栽完水田和麦田的稻秧。选留小麦、大麦良种，作到单收、单打、单藏。加强民兵打更放哨，严密防特务、防火、防贼、保卫麦收。农业税开征后，保证在一天内全部缴清。
    鲁山县一百四十七个互助组在应战书中提出：各组实行田间选种，选留短二芒和红蚰子等优良麦种，保证今秋种麦时全部采用良种。麦收开始后，保证在六日内收完打完。夏季农业税开征后，全部缴标准粮。各组组员并积极参加护麦队，保护麦收，防止反革命分子破坏。五天内完成夏种，并做到犁一遍、耙二遍、每次上粪五车，进行浸种和拌种，预防病虫灾害。
    湖南杨天才和廖仁福互助组完成向李顺达互助组应战计划
    向李顺达互助组应战的湖南省著名劳动模范杨天才和衡阳市郊区廖仁福互助组，已完成春季生产应战计划。杨天才的棉田已普遍犁了一遍，耙了四遍；棉田的施肥量超过原订计划的百分之四十。在棉花播种前，他精选出“德字棉”种一百零三斤，并且都用药拌过。现早棉已出土三、四寸。他正在积极抢收夏收作物和抢种夏田。
    廖仁福互助组的春季应战计划，是在和霪雨作了不懈斗争之后完成的。
    新疆军区参加农业生产部队  八十万亩播种计划大部完成
    人民解放军新疆军区参加农业生产部队播种八十万亩的计划，现已大部完成。目前天山南北广阔无边的田野间，早植棉籽已出芽生叶，麦苗高达五寸。参加生产的指战员们正全力准备灌溉除草。新疆军区为使雄厚的劳动力适应规模巨大的集体农业生产，今年播种的土地比去年要集中。各连队均按耕作的需要，组织灌溉、耕地、耙、耱等生产小组，做到了合理地使用劳动力。由于采用了新农具和新的农作法，耕作效率大大提高，大批劳动力能够抽出来从事建筑营房、工厂，兴修巨大的水利工程等；同时也推动了驻地维吾尔族农民开始施肥、耱地和用耧种地，在广大的田野里，部队的文化娱乐活动十分活跃。每当傍晚收工以后，锣鼓声就响起来，战士们有的跳维吾尔族舞，有的观看在野外放映的新电影。
    “火碱”不可与粪干搀合使用
    根据农民报告，在北京郊区，有些私营粪商，将“火碱”（植物油加工处理后的渣滓）搀入粪稀中，晒制粪干，农民使用后，受的损失很大。
    “火碱”的成分，含有植物油、肥皂与少量苛性钠，碱度在十度以上（一般土地酸碱度高在九以上的，植物就不能生存），不含有植物所需要的肥料成分，与粪干搀合，加速粪中有效氮素的分解与丢失，施到田里，侵蚀作物根茎，为害甚大，甚至死亡，以后也不好再种其他庄稼。这件不合理的事情的发生原因约有下列几点：（一）有些粪商想在粪中搀假搀伪，蒙蔽农民，以图厚利。（二）大部农民，认为粪干的颜色愈黑，粪的品质愈好，用在地里肥效最大。粪商利用此点，加入些碱性物质，使有机质颜色加深。（三）多数农民误认为“油”系植物所必需的肥料，故联想到利用“油渣子”到肥料上面去。这是不正确的，因为植物油的化学成分内，并没有庄稼所需要的养料。
