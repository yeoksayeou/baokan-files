    Shijiazhuang Special District

    Organizes Patriotic Cotton Procurement Committee

    Procurement and Storage Preparations Completed

    The preparations for cotton procurement and storage in the Shijiazhuang Special District have been completed. The Shijiazhuang Commissioner's Office and the Shijiazhuang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting on the 2nd of responsible persons from the special district-level Party committees, government, people's organizations, and economic departments, deciding to mobilize all cadres, CCP members, Communist Youth League members, and cooperative members throughout the district to conduct patriotic education among cotton farmers, striving to procure and store more than 80% of the total cotton held by cotton farmers in the entire district. After the meeting, the Commissioner's Office and the CCP District Committee dispatched 59 cadres to work with more than 4,000 county and district cadres in eight counties including Jin County, Shulu, and Gaocheng, which are important cotton-producing areas, to carry out cotton procurement and storage work in the countryside.

    Currently, patriotic cotton procurement committees have been organized at both the special district and county levels by various economic work departments and the CCP committees, people's governments, and people's organizations. At the district level, patriotic cotton procurement committees have also been organized in zones based on the distance from cotton-producing villages and the amount of cotton stored by cotton farmers, and village cadres with large cotton stores have been absorbed to strengthen leadership over cotton procurement and storage work. In villages without grassroots cooperatives, cotton procurement teams are being organized one after another. Various state-owned trading companies have already coordinated with cooperatives to allocate 65.7 million catties of various grains, 200,000 bolts of cloth, and daily necessities worth 9.9 billion yuan to cotton-producing areas. The coal industry company is also rapidly planning to purchase and transport anthracite coal and kerosene, which are favored by cotton farmers, from Yangquan, Shanxi, and Beijing and Tianjin.

    As of the 5th, fifteen units in the entire special district, including机关 production departments and finance and economics departments, had sold all of their stored ginned cotton, totaling more than 330,000 catties, to the Textile Company. In the vast rural areas of the cotton-producing districts, representative meetings of CCP members, Communist Youth League members, and cadre meetings are being held everywhere. A patriotic cotton selling and storage competition is about to begin.

　　石家庄专区
    组织爱国收棉委员会
    购棉储棉各种准备工作完成
    石家庄专区购棉储棉的准备工作已经完成。石家庄专署和中共石家庄地方委员会二日召开专区级党委、政府、各人民团体和各经济部门负责人的会议，决定动员全区干部、中共党员、青年团员与合作社员全力向棉农进行爱国主义教育，争取购棉、储棉达到全区棉农存棉总数的百分之八十以上。会后，专署与中共地委即派出干部五十九人，配合重要购棉地区晋县、束鹿、藁城等八县的四千多个县、区干部，下乡进行购棉、储棉工作。
    现在专区和县两级已由各经济工作部门和中共党委、人民政府、人民团体，分别组织爱国收棉委员会。区一级又根据产棉村的远近、棉农存棉量多少，分片组织了爱国收棉委员会，并吸收存棉多的村干部参加，以便加强对购棉、储棉工作的领导。没有基层合作社的村庄，正陆续组织购棉小组。各国营贸易公司已经配合合作社调拨各种粮食六千五百七十万斤、布二十万匹、价值九十九亿元的日用百货到产棉区。煤业公司也正在急速筹划从山西阳泉和北京、天津等地购运棉农所爱用的无烟煤炭、煤油等。
    截至五日止，全专区已有机关生产部门、财经部门的十五个单位将所存皮棉三十三万多斤全部售与花纱布公司。产棉区广大农村目前正普遍举行中共党员、青年团员代表会与干部会。爱国主义的售棉、储棉竞赛运动即将展开。
