　　Patriotic Propaganda Strengthened Among Farmers
　  Central South District Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Completed Cotton Purchase Plan Last Month
    The Central South District Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company overfulfilled its cotton purchasing task in May, with the purchase volume reaching 111.03% of the original plan. Among them, Hubei completed 104.12%, Henan completed 110.08%, and Hunan completed 163.99%. The reasons for the overfulfillment are: the cotton yarn and cloth companies at all levels clearly recognized the importance of vigorously purchasing raw cotton to support textile production. Under the correct leadership of the local Party and government, they strengthened propaganda work, enabling cotton farmers to generally understand that selling cotton to the state is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. The Hubei Tianmen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company organized mobile purchasing teams to go deep into the countryside, combining with land reform work teams to carry out propaganda work, dispelling farmers' concerns. At the same time, it mobilized farmers' associations to establish purchasing groups by village, with the township head and farmers' association chairman serving as the head and deputy head, directly persuading farmers to sell. The Henan Nanyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company paid close attention to propaganda work and organized a number of cotton merchants to go deep into the countryside to purchase and encourage purchases. The company summarized its cotton purchasing experience every ten days and introduced the experience to branch companies and cotton purchasing stations. The company also put forward conditions to ensure the completion of the task, challenging brother companies in the province to compete, which played a certain role in promoting cotton collection. As a result, the company overfulfilled its target by 125.2% in April, and basically completed its major task in May. The responsible comrades of the Henan Shanzhou Branch Company personally convened a joint meeting of directors of various offices, put forward specific guarantees for completing the task, and responded to the business competition challenge of the Nanyang Branch Company. The company overfulfilled the original plan by 110.13% in April, and overfulfilled the May purchase plan by May 20. Later, the company took the initiative to increase the planned quantity by 2,000 dan, so that May completed 150.68% of the original plan. (Jin Wu)

　　对农民加强了爱国主义宣传
　  中南区花纱布公司上月完成购棉计划
    中南区花纱布公司五月份超额完成棉花收购任务，收购量达到原计划的百分之一一一点○三。其中湖北完成百分之一○四点一二，河南完成百分之一一○点○八，湖南完成了百分之一六三点九九。超额完成的原因是：各级花纱布公司明确地认识了大力收购原棉，支援纺织生产的重要性，在当地党和政府的正确领导下，加强宣传工作，使棉农普遍了解到把棉花卖给国家，就是爱国主义的具体表现。湖北天门花纱布公司曾组织流动收购小组，深入农村，与土地改革工作队相结合，进行宣传工作，打破了农民的顾虑。同时发动农会，以村为单位，成立收购组，由乡长和农会主席分任正副组长，直接向农民劝售。河南南阳花纱布分公司很注意宣传工作，并组织了若干棉花贩，深入农村采购、劝购。该公司每一旬总结收棉经验一次，并将经验介绍到支公司和收花站。该公司还提出了保证完成任务的条件，向省内兄弟公司挑战竞赛，对收棉起了一定的推动作用。因此该公司在四月份超额完成了百分之一二五点二，五月份也基本完成了重大的任务。河南陕州分公司负责同志亲自动手，召开了各办事处主任联席会议，提出完成任务的具体保证，并响应了南阳分公司业务竞赛的挑战。该公司在四月份超额完成原计划的百分之一一○点一三，在五月二十日就超额完成了五月份的收购计划。以后该公司又主动将计划数增加了二千担，使五月份完成了原计划的百分之一五○点六八。  （靳吾）
