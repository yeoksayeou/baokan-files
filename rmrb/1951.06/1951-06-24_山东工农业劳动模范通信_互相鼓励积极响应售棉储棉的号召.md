    Mutual Encouragement to Actively Respond to the Call to Sell and Store Cotton

    Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on the work of purchasing and storing cotton, Shandong model workers in industry and agriculture have responded enthusiastically, encouraging each other through correspondence, demonstrating the spirit of unity and mutual assistance between workers and peasants.

    Luo Shufang, a weaving expert, wrote to Liu Honggang and Li Peifan, model cotton growers, and all cotton-growing brothers in the province: "In recent years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our industrial and agricultural production has developed, and everyone's lives have improved. The demand for yarn and cloth has also increased. Our factory used to need more than 8,000 jin of cotton a day, but now it needs more than 10,000 jin. However, our province didn't grow enough cotton last year, which is not enough. For this reason, our workers have come up with many ways to save cotton. In the past, each machine produced an average of 20 liang of white waste cotton per day. Now, the workers have created a new record of less waste cotton, with each machine producing only three or four liang of white waste cotton per day. Liu Qingyun and Wei Guilan managed to produce only one liang of waste cotton. We also mixed the previously unused inferior cotton with good cotton, under the condition that the quality of the cloth is not affected. Although we have tried many methods, we still cannot solve the difficulty of cotton shortage. Now, American imperialism is implementing an economic blockade against us, and cotton is even more scarce. Therefore, our factory had to stop work on June 1st. I hope that everyone will show a high degree of patriotism and sell all the stored cotton to the state, so that the yarn factory can continue to operate, so that we can have jobs, the military and civilians can have clothes to wear, and strive for the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. You sell the stored cotton to the state to supply the needs of the yarn factory, and we weave cloth to supply you with clothes. This not only plays a huge role in the country's economic construction, but also has great significance for our worker-peasant alliance."

    Liu Qingxiang, a model worker who created the fine plate grinding machine, wrote to Liu Honggang and others: "We workers often care about our peasant brothers and sisters, and think of various ways to manufacture new agricultural tools that meet the needs of agricultural production to help everyone increase production and work together to build our country. Shandong is often dry in spring every year, which often reduces harvests. In order to ensure increased cotton production, Comrade Liu Qingfen and I have been researching an automatic waterwheel in our spare time. It does not require manpower or livestock, and only one and a half laborers can watch the ditch to irrigate the land, which can save a lot of labor. Now our yarn factory has stopped working due to lack of cotton. This is a major event related to the national economy and the lives of the military and civilians. I hope that everyone will quickly respond to the call of the state and sell the cotton to the state. You sell the cotton to the state, and we supply you with agricultural tools. Let's workers and peasants join hands to overcome difficulties and smash the blockade of American imperialism!"

    Liu Honggang, a model cotton grower, replied: "When cotton is in short supply, the country faces difficulties due to a shortage of cotton. We cotton farmers should care about the country's difficulties as masters of the country. We must not store cotton ourselves and let the yarn factory stop working. Therefore, after receiving the government's call, I immediately persuaded my family to sell all 350 jin of cotton to the state. I also persuaded two households including Liu Xuehai to sell 200 jin of cotton. Gao Decai and other four ginneries are also preparing to temporarily stop work and sell the capital cotton to the state. I also conducted extensive publicity through various meetings, striving to make it known to every household and striving for every cotton-storing household to participate in this movement."

    Xu Mingxiang (female) and Yang Fushen, agricultural model workers from Dongguang County who attended the Provincial Model Worker Representative Conference, also corresponded with each other.

    Xu Mingxiang wrote to Yang Fushen: "We must learn from the spirit of Li Shunda, a model worker in Shanxi, and not only be a model worker, but also be a patriotic model. We must use our model actions to promote everyone to complete the task of selling and storing cotton. This is a manifestation of patriotism."

    Yang Fushen replied: "On the fifth of this month, as soon as I saw the central government's instructions on cotton purchase, I convened a meeting of the mutual aid group before finishing my meal. Three or four households signed up on the spot to sell all the cotton to the state. I also challenged all cotton farmers in the province. Now 14 households in our village have sold 1,500 jin of cotton to the state. In another five days, all the stored cotton in the village can be taken out."

    Under the leading influence of these model workers, the Shandong cotton selling and storing campaign is now in full swing.

　　山东工农业劳动模范通信
    互相鼓励积极响应售棉储棉的号召
      茂林　洪泽
    中央人民政府政务院发出关于购棉储棉工作的指示以后，山东工农业劳动模范热烈响应，互相通信鼓励，表现了工人农民团结互助的精神。
    织布能手骆淑芳给植棉劳动模范刘洪岗、李配范和全省棉农兄弟的信上说：“近几年来，在毛主席的领导下，咱们的工农业生产都有了发展，大家的生活都有了改善，大家需要的洋线、布匹也就增多了。我们的工厂，过去一天需要八千多斤棉花，现在就要用一万多斤了。可是咱省去年种的棉花还不够多，不够用。为了这件事，我们工人曾想了很多办法节约棉花。过去每天每台车平均出二十两白花，现在工人们创造了少出白花的新纪录，每天每台车只出三、四两白花。刘庆云、魏桂兰作到只出一两白花。我们还把过去不用的次花，在不影响布匹质量的条件下，掺在好棉花里用了。虽然我们想了很多办法，可是还不能解决缺乏棉花的困难。现在美帝国主义又对咱们实行经济封锁，棉花就更缺乏了。所以我们的工厂不得不在六月一日停了工。我希望大家发挥高度的爱国热情，把存的棉花全部卖给国家，好叫纱厂继续开工，叫我们有工作，军民有衣穿，争取抗美援朝的胜利。你们把存棉卖给国家，供给纱厂需要，我们织了布再供给你们穿衣，这不仅对国家经济建设起了巨大作用，对咱们工农联盟也有重大的意义。”
    创造精板对磨机的劳动模范刘庆祥在写给刘洪岗等的信上说：“我们工人时常关心着农民兄弟，想各种办法制造适合农业生产需要的新式农具，帮助大家增产，共同努力建设咱们的国家。咱山东年年春旱，常常减少收成，为了保证棉花增产，我和刘庆芬同志在业余时间研究了一种自动式水车，不用人力和牲口，只用一个半劳动力看沟子就能浇地，这样能节省很多劳力。现在咱们的纱厂因为缺少棉花停了工，这是关系着国民经济和军民生活的大事情，希望大家快快响应国家的号召，把棉花卖给国家。你们把棉花卖给国家，我们供给你们农具，咱工人农民拉起手来，为克服困难，粉碎美帝国主义的封锁而奋斗！”
    植棉劳动模范刘洪岗的回信说：“在棉花新陈不接的时候，国家发生了缺乏棉花的困难；我们棉农应该以国家主人翁的姿态，来关心国家的困难。决不能自己存着棉花叫纱厂停工。所以我在接到政府的号召以后，马上说服家庭，把所有的三百五十斤棉花全部卖给了国家。又说服刘学海等二户卖出棉花二百斤。高德才等四家轧花铺，也准备临时停工，把资本棉卖给国家。我还通过各种会议，进行了广泛的宣传，争取做到家喻户晓，争取存棉户人人都参加这一运动。”
    东光县出席省劳动模范代表会议的农业劳动模范徐明香（女）和杨福深也互相通信。
    徐明香写信给杨福深说：“咱们要学习山西劳动模范李顺达的精神，不光作一个劳动模范，还要作一个爱国模范。咱们要以自己的模范行动，推动大家完成售棉储棉任务，这就是爱国的表示。”
    杨福深回信说：“这月五日我一看到中央的购棉指示，没吃完饭就召集互助组开会，当场就有三、四户报名，把棉花全部卖给国家。我还向全省棉农挑了战。现在俺村已有十四户把一千五百斤棉花卖给了国家。再有五天全村存棉就都可以拿出了。
    在这些劳动模范们的带头影响下，山东售棉储棉运动现正热烈开展。
