　　Selling All Stored Cotton to the State
    ——A Record of the Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign Led by the Henggu Village CCP Branch
　　Mao Feng'en, Shan Zhiyou
    Editor's Note: The Henggu Village CCP Branch in Fengnan County, Hebei is one of the better branches in Fengnan County. This branch has a relatively good democratic style, is good at uniting all village cadres and the masses, and completing various tasks. This time, the cotton selling work was completed ahead of schedule; this is one example of good leadership by the branch.
    In the cotton selling and storing campaign, many Communist Party branches emerged that led farmers to successfully complete their tasks. The Henggu Village Communist Party Branch in Fengnan County, Hebei, is one such branch.
    After reading the instructions from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP regarding the cotton selling and storing, Wang Qingjun, the secretary of the Henggu Village Communist Party Branch, immediately convened a branch committee to discuss the instructions and calls from the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Central Committee of the CCP, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP regarding carrying out the cotton selling and storing campaign, and discussed the methods for carrying out this campaign. The meeting decided to immediately organize all forces to deeply publicize the instructions from higher authorities regarding selling and storing cotton to cotton farmers, and to mobilize cotton farmers to consciously launch a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign.
    At the general meeting of all party members and Youth League members on the evening of the third day, Wang Qingjun solemnly raised this issue again. He said that Henggu Village has four natural villages, 424 households, and it would be difficult to complete the patriotic cotton selling and storing task relying solely on six Communist Party members and eighteen Youth League members. Therefore, it is necessary to unite non-Party cadres and other active elements to do this work well. Youth League member Dong Linqing said: "Party members and Youth League members must first convince the people in their own families to sell cotton to the state or store it in cooperatives, and use their own exemplary actions to motivate everyone to sell and store cotton." Communist Party member Xu Heming added: "We must also be good at uniting all forces to carry out in-depth publicity and education work in order to complete this task." These opinions became the action slogan of all Party members and Youth League members.
    The next day, all the Communist Party members, Youth League members, village government cadres, and village cooperative cadres in the village, under the leadership of the Party, used various mass gathering occasions to conduct publicity on cotton selling and storing to cotton farmers. School teachers also led 180 students to conduct publicity and mobilization on the streets. Four blackboards and the evening rooftop broadcasts were also used to promote cotton selling and storing. The village quickly formed a consensus of "Responding to the call of the People's Government, selling cotton to the state" and "Selling cotton to the state means resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country."
    Because all forces were mobilized, the publicity to cotton farmers was extensive and in-depth. When Communist Party member Dong Yinhe and propagandist Xiao Qinghe were publicizing to cotton farmer Zhang Shaoliang, they started by talking about the current cotton seedling situation, and finally said: "Now our national textile factories are going to stop working. ... The People's Government is calling on us to sell cotton to the state, so that workers have jobs and we have clothes to wear." After listening, Zhang Shaoliang said: "I will sell all 300 jin of stored cotton to the state." Following this, Dong Yinhe and others mobilized ten households including Zhang Zemin to sell 1,400 jin of cotton.
    Many people in the village said that Liu Qinghai was a "stubborn head." Propagandist Liu Yuwei took the initiative to mobilize Liu Qinghai to sell cotton. He said to Liu Qinghai: "These past few years, growing cotton has really been profitable. Last year, the People's Government lent us fertilizer and bean cake; as soon as the cotton was harvested, the government bought it at a high price. The cooperative delivered grain to our homes. Our lives are getting better and better. Thinking back to the past when the Japanese devils used the method of exclusively selling cotton, they really harmed us, making us cotton farmers eat chaff..." After hearing this, Liu Qinghai immediately recalled the suffering he had endured in the past and said with great emotion: "Thinking back to the years of eating chaff, it's really hard to bear. The Communist Party and the People's Government are so good to us, how can we store cotton and not sell it to the state?" Liu Qinghai immediately sold the 300 jin of cotton he had stored to the state.
    In the process of publicity, the branch also promptly mobilized cotton farmers who were already aware to promote cotton selling and storing to backward cotton farmers.
    On the evening of the fifth, the branch also mobilized farmers to hold small discussion meetings separately to further discuss the issue of cotton selling and storing. Active elements spoke enthusiastically at the discussion meetings, and together with Communist Party members and Youth League members, took the lead in signing up to sell cotton. Cotton farmer Wang Shengjun said: "In order to resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, I will sell all my cotton to the state." That night, cotton farmers sold more than 13,000 jin of cotton to the state.
    Following this, the branch convened another branch committee meeting to review the progress of this work. The meeting analyzed the actual situation of cotton storage in the village and unanimously agreed that the enthusiasm of general cotton farmers to sell cotton had been aroused, but a few people still had ideological concerns and had not yet been involved in the cotton selling and storing campaign, and that arduous work should continue to be carried out. After the meeting, branch members went deep into the masses to understand the situation and found that some households had not agreed to lend cotton to relatives before, and now they were embarrassed to take it out; some households did not need money and did not want to sell cotton; a few households were still waiting for a high price; and some women were keeping cotton to spin their own yarn. The branch studied these situations and decided to assign special personnel to be responsible for individual persuasion and mobilization. Cotton farmer Meng Guangdong wanted to wait for the price of cotton to rise before selling. Communist Party member Zhang Yuying and finance and grain committee member Dong Lianxin went to mobilize him and told him: "The People's Government has a method. If you don't want to sell now, you can store it in the cooperative. Whenever you need money, you can sell it, and the price of cotton will rise but not fall." Meng Guangdong understood this reasoning and stored 205 jin of cotton in the cooperative. Cotton farmer Xiao Qingfu had 150 jin of cotton and originally wanted to sell it to the state, but because relatives had wanted to borrow it in the past and he had not agreed, he was now afraid of offending people if he took it all out. He only said that he wanted to sell 50 jin. Youth League member Dong Fengting persuaded him: "If you sell cotton to the state, it will benefit the people of the whole country; people will not blame you." Xiao Qingfu felt that this made sense and sold the remaining 100 jin of cotton to the cooperative as well.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party branch, cotton farmers in Henggu Village sold or stored all their cotton to the state within five days. On June 8, eleven large carts transported 16,883 and a half jin of cotton to the Fengnan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

　　把全部存棉卖给国家
    ——记横沽村中共支部领导的售棉储棉运动
　　毛凤恩　单志友
    编者按：中共河北丰南县横沽村支部是丰南县较好的支部之一。这个支部有比较优良的民主作风，善于团结全村干部和群众，完成各种工作。这次售棉工作，该村也提前完成了；这是支部领导得好的一例。
    在售棉储棉运动中，涌现了很多领导农民胜利完成任务的共产党支部。河北丰南县横沽村共产党支部，就是这种支部中的一个。
    横沽村共产党支部书记王庆俊，在报纸上看到中共河北省委关于售棉储棉的指示后，马上召开支部委员会，讨论中央人民政府政务院、中共中央、河北省政府、中共河北省委关于开展售棉储棉运动的指示和号召，并讨论了开展这一运动的方法。会上决定立即组织一切力量，向棉农深入宣传上级关于售棉、储棉的指示，发动棉农自觉地展开爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。
    王庆俊在三日晚间的全体党员、团员大会上，又把这问题郑重地提出来。他说，横沽村有四个自然村，四百二十四户人家，单靠六个共产党员，十八个青年团员，是难以完成爱国主义售棉储棉任务的。因此，必须团结非党干部和其他积极分子，来作好这一工作。青年团员董林清说：“党员、团员要首先说服自己家里的人，把棉花卖给国家或存到合作社，以自己的模范行动，带动大家售棉储棉。”共产党员徐鹤明补充说：“我们还要善于团结一切力量进行深入的宣传教育工作，才能完成这一任务。”这些意见变成了全体党员、团员的行动的口号。
    第二天，全村所有的共产党员、青年团员、村政府干部、村合作社干部，都在党的领导下，利用各种群众集会场合，向棉农进行售棉储棉的宣传。学校教员也领着一百八十个学生，在街上进行宣传鼓动。四块黑板报和晚上的屋顶广播，也都是宣传售棉储棉。村里很快形成一片“响应人民政府的号召，把棉花卖给国家”，“把棉花卖给国家，就是抗美援朝、保家卫国”的舆论。
    由于动员了一切力量，所以向棉农进行的宣传是广泛而深入的。共产党员董印和宣传员萧庆和向棉农张绍良宣传时，先从现在的棉苗情形谈起，最后说：“现在咱们全国的纺纱厂要停工。……人民政府号召咱们把棉花卖给国家，工人有工作，咱们也有衣穿。”张绍良听了，就说：“我把三百斤存棉都卖给国家。”接着，董印和等又动员张泽民等十户，卖了一千四百斤棉花。
    村里许多人都说刘庆海是“顽固头”。宣传员刘玉维主动地去动员刘庆海卖棉花。他对刘庆海说：“这几年来，种棉花真得利。去年人民政府贷给咱肥田粉、豆饼；棉花刚下来，政府就高价收买。合作社把粮食运到家来。咱们的日子过得越来越好了。想起过去日本鬼子用专销棉花的办法，真把咱坑苦了，弄得咱种棉户都吃糠……”刘庆海听了后，立刻回忆起过去受苦的情形来，非常感动地说：“想起吃糠的年头，真难受。共产党、人民政府对咱们这样好，咱们还能存着棉花不卖给国家？”刘庆海立即把自己存下的三百斤棉花卖给国家。
    在宣传过程中，支部并及时发动已经觉悟的棉农，推动落后的棉农售棉储棉。
    支部在五日晚上，又发动农民分别召开小型座谈会，进一步地讨论售棉储棉的问题。积极分子在座谈会上热烈发言，并和共产党员、青年团员一起带头报名卖棉花。棉农王胜君说：“为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，我把棉花全部卖给国家。”这天晚上，棉农共卖给国家棉花一万三千多斤。
    接着，支部又召开支部委员会，检查这一工作的进行情况。会上分析了村里存棉的实际情况，一致认为，一般棉农卖棉的热情是鼓动起来了，但个别的人还有思想顾虑，尚未卷入售棉储棉运动，应该继续进行艰苦的工作。会后，支部委员分别深入群众了解情况，发现有的户以前没答应把棉花借给亲戚，现在拿出来不好意思；有的户是不等钱花，不想卖棉花；个别户仍在盼大价钱；有个别妇女留着棉花自己纺线。支部研究了这些情况，决定由专人负责，个别说服动员。棉农孟广栋就是要等棉花涨价再卖。共产党员张玉英和财粮委员董连信，就去动员他，告诉他道：“人民政府有个办法，现在如果不愿意卖，可以存到合作社，什么时候要钱，就什么时候卖，棉价随涨不随落。”孟广栋想通了这个道理，就把二百零五斤棉花存入合作社。棉农萧庆富有一百五十斤棉花，本想卖给国家，但是因为过去亲戚要借，他没答允，现在都拿出来，怕得罪人。只表示要卖五十斤。团员董凤亭劝他说：“你把棉花卖给国家，对全国人民都有好处；人家也不会责备你的。”萧庆富觉得有道理，把剩下的一百斤棉花也卖给了合作社。
    横沽村棉农在共产党支部领导下，五天内把全部棉花卖给了国家或存给国家。六月八日，十一辆大车把一万六千八百八十三斤半棉花，送到了丰南县供销社。
