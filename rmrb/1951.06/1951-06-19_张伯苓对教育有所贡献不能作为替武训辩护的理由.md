    Zhang Boling's Contributions to Education Cannot Be a Reason to Defend Wu Xun
    (1) Editor:
    In the discussion of *The Life of Wu Xun*, some people use Mr. Zhang Boling's "contributions to education" as a reason to defend Wu Xun. I believe that Mr. Zhang Boling did indeed make "contributions to education," but this should not be used as a reason to defend Wu Xun. Because Mr. Zhang Boling ran a Western bourgeois education, accepted the Western cultural tradition, and spread Western bourgeois ideology and lifestyle, which played a certain positive role in opposing feudal culture. Of course, we should also criticize Mr. Zhang Boling's mistakes in politically placing his hopes on the reactionary ruling class, and even serving as the president of the Examination Yuan of the Kuomintang reactionary government in his later years. However, this should not negate his past contributions to education. Just as although the bourgeoisie has gradually become reactionary and declining on the world's historical stage, Marx and Engels also pointed out: "The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part." (*The Communist Manifesto*). This is the method of viewing problems from a historical perspective. However, Wu Xun, at the time of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion, peasant anti-feudal revolutionary movements, vigorously promoted feudal culture, cultivated "talents" for the feudal landlord class, and opposed the peasant anti-feudal revolution, which clearly played a role in "hindering social development." Therefore, he was completely reactionary. I heard some people distorting "historical conditions" to defend Wu Xun; but when they compared Mr. Zhang Boling with Wu Xun, they just forgot the "historical conditions."

    Some people mentioned what contributions Zhang Boling actually made to education, and why people said that he played a progressive role? And "feel injustice" for Wu Xun, thinking that criticizing Wu Xun lacks "lofty political demeanor," making people unable to be convinced, etc. I think this is very boring.
    Zhang Boling stumbled politically, which we cannot forgive, but the education he ran promoted Western bourgeois ideology, which played a certain progressive role at the time, and it is obviously undeniable. This evaluation is realistic and has a clear stand. Wu Xun was a thorough slave of the feudal ruling class, and hindered social development; if we violate the historical viewpoint and tolerate the eulogy of Wu Xun, it would be a great mistake. Shouldn't our political demeanor be so clear about right and wrong?

### 张伯苓对教育有所贡献不能作为替武训辩护的理由

    张伯苓对教育有所贡献不能作为替武训辩护的理由
    （一）编辑同志：
    在武训传的讨论中有人把张伯苓先生“对教育事业有所贡献”作理由，来为武训辩护。我认为：张伯苓先生的确“对教育事业有所贡献”，但这决不能作为替武训辩护的理由。因为张伯苓先生办的是西洋资产阶级的教育，接受西洋文化传统，散播西洋资产阶级的思想意识和生活方式，对于反对封建文化这一点来说，起了一定的积极作用。当然我们也应该批评张伯苓先生在政治上曾寄希望于反动统治阶级，晚年竟任国民党反动政府考试院院长这些错误。但是不能因此就否定了他过去对教育事业的贡献。正如虽然资产阶级在世界历史的舞台上逐渐走向反动和没落了，然而马克思和恩格斯还指出：“资产阶级在历史上起过非常革命的作用。”（《共产党宣言》）这就是用历史观点看问题的方法。而武训处在太平天国、捻军等农民反封建革命运动轰轰烈烈的时候，却竭力宣传封建文化，为封建地主阶级造就“人材”，反对农民的反封建革命，这明明起了“阻碍社会发展”的作用。因此，他完全是反动的。我听到一些人曲解“历史条件”来为武训辩护；但他们用张伯苓先生与武训相比的时候，恰恰就忘记了“历史条件”。
                                                    刘白笔
    （二）编辑同志：
    有人提到张伯苓究竟对教育事业有什么贡献，人们为什么说他起了进步作用呢？而为武训“抱不平”，认为批判武训是缺乏“崇高的政治风度”，使人不能心服等等，我觉得这是很无聊的。
    张伯苓曾在政治上失足了，这是我们不能原谅的，但他所办的教育宣扬了西洋资产阶级思想意识，这在当时起了一定的进步作用，也是显然不能否认的。这种估价是实事求是的，也是立场分明的。而武训是封建统治阶级彻头彻尾的奴才，对社会发展起了阻碍作用；如果我们违反历史观点，容忍对武训的歌颂，那是绝大的错误。我们的政治风度难道不是应该这样是非分明的吗？
