　　Shanghai Private Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 1 Workers
　　Establish Patriotic Pact Inspector System
    The workers of Shanghai Private Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 1 established a patriotic pact inspector system, effectively promoting the implementation of the patriotic pact. At the end of December last year, the factory workers had formulated a patriotic pact, but because of a lack of sufficient ideological preparation beforehand, and no follow-up inspection afterward, the pact clauses posted on the wall were damaged by rain, and everyone forgot about it. After the citywide workers held a parade on March 4th this year to oppose the United States arming Japan, they saw the achievements of workers in other factories in implementing patriotic pacts, which aroused their attention to patriotic pacts again, and they demanded a re-draft. This time, they learned from their past lessons, and after preliminary publicity and discussion, the content of the pact was generally practical and easy to remember. To facilitate inspection, each group automatically requested the establishment of an inspector system to be responsible for recording the implementation of the pact. The factory trade union studied the workers' request and decided to implement it first in the bobbin winding group.
    The bobbin winding group democratically elected inspectors for the group based on three criteria: active production, keeping promises, and ease of inspection at the work post. At the weekly group inspection meeting, in addition to each worker making a self-criticism, the inspectors provided materials on the implementation of the pact based on their usual records, helping the group with the inspection. Therefore, the group inspection meetings were held relatively well. For example, the first group inspection meeting reviewed the phenomenon of individual workers throwing away waste silk and bobbins randomly, and proposed methods to improve splicing operations to reduce waste silk. By the fourth group inspection meeting, the female worker Chen Xiaomei still pulled the waste silk very long. After the inspector's patient explanation, Chen Xiaomei finally improved her operation. The female worker Lu Aida refused to conduct a self-criticism at the meeting, thinking that it was a lot of trouble after the pact was signed. The group understood that the reason for her lack of enthusiasm was that it was inconvenient for her to bend over due to pregnancy, and she often produced waste silk. After the inspection meeting studied the situation, it requested the administration to transfer her to a lighter bobbin-winding job. Lu Aida was very moved and actively participated in the inspection meeting afterward. Due to the in-depth inspection work of the group, the amount of waste silk in the group has been greatly reduced.
    After the bobbin winding group successfully piloted the inspector system, all fourteen groups in the factory also elected inspectors one after another. The factory trade union executive committee also selected a chief inspector to regularly check the group records. In the new Class B group of the weaving machine room, only one person did not weave defective cloth at the first inspection meeting, but by the third inspection, the number of people who did not weave defective cloth had increased to ten. In the past, the old Class B group of the weaving machine room often had the phenomenon of搶领 (qiang ling - rushing to claim/grab) weaving machine wooden shafts, which made it impossible for workers who urgently needed them to receive them, affecting production. Since the establishment of the inspector system, after the inspection of the group inspection meeting, all workers in the group consciously abide by the pact of "no cloth falling, no wooden shaft claiming", and the production order has been greatly improved. After the factory workers implemented the patriotic pact, they not only improved production, but also made achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and learning. In order to implement the clause of "distinguishing between the enemy and us and reporting counter-revolutionary elements," the workers have already reported two counter-revolutionary elements in the factory. In the past, the factory workers' spare-time school often had the phenomenon of "赖学" (lai xue - shirking school). After the implementation of the patriotic pact, the workers consciously guaranteed to attend school. The reading newspaper system has also been established.
    Since the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Headquarters issued a call for promoting patriotic pacts, donating planes and artillery, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel, the 194 employees of the factory have automatically donated more than 10 million yuan within four days. Each group is also discussing plans to increase production and donations so that it can be added to the patriotic pact. Now they are brewing a revision of the patriotic pact, preparing to delete the more empty or completely achieved clauses, and add new clauses.

### 上海私营永大染织一厂职工建立爱国公约检查员制度

　　上海私营永大染织一厂职工
　　建立爱国公约检查员制度
    上海市私营永大染织一厂职工建立爱国公约的检查员制度，有效地推动了爱国公约的执行。该厂职工在去年十二月底曾订过一次爱国公约，但因事先缺少充分的思想酝酿，事后又没有检查，结果贴在墙上的公约条文被雨水淋坏，大家也就忘了。到今年三月四日全市工人举行反对美国武装日本大游行以后，他们看到其他工厂职工执行爱国公约的成绩，又引起了他们对爱国公约的重视，纷纷要求重订。这次重订时，他们接受了过去的教训，事先经过宣传讨论，因而公约内容一般都很切实，而且易记。为便于检查，各小组自动要求建立检查员制度，负责记录公约的执行情况。该厂工会研究了工人这一要求，决定先在筒子车小组里试行。
    筒子车小组根据积极生产、说到做到、工作岗位便于检查等三个条件，民主选出了小组的检查员。在每周小组检查会议上，除了每个工人作自我检讨，检查员就根据平时记录，提供执行情况的材料，帮助小组检查。因此，小组检查会议开得比较好。例如第一次小组检查会议曾检讨了个别工人把回丝、筒子乱丢的现象，并提出了改进接头操作法的办法，以减少回丝。到第四次小组检查会议时，女工陈小妹回丝还是拉得很长。经检查员耐心解释，陈小妹终于改进了操作法。女工陆阿大在会上不肯检讨，认为订立公约后麻烦死了。小组了解了她不积极的原因是怀孕弯身不便，常出回丝，又经检查会议研究后，就提请行政上调她做较轻便的倒筒脚工作。陆阿大很受感动，以后积极参加了检查会议。由于小组检查工作做得深入，小组回丝量已大大减少。
    筒子车小组试行检查员制度成功后，全厂十四个小组也都先后选出了检查员。该厂工会执委会并选出总检查员一人，经常检查小组记录。布机间新乙班小组，在第一次检查会议时只有一人未织坏布，到第三次检查时未织坏布的即增加到十人。布机间老乙班小组过去常发生抢领布机木轴的现象，弄得迫切需要的工人反而领不到，影响生产。自建立检查员制度后，经过小组检查会议的检查，全组工人自觉遵守“不落布不领木轴”的公约，生产秩序就大为改进。该厂工人执行爱国公约后，不但改进了生产，而且在镇压反革命和学习上也已作出成绩。为执行“分清敌我，检举反革命分子”的一条，职工已在厂内检举了两个反革命分子。该厂职工业余学校过去常有“赖学”现象。执行爱国公约后，工人都自觉地保证上学。读报制度也已建立。
    自中国人民抗美援朝总会发出关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属、军属的号召后，该厂一百九十四名职工四天之内已自动捐献了一千多万元，各小组还在讨论增产捐献计划，以便把它增补到爱国公约里去，现在他们正酝酿修订爱国公约，准备把比较空洞或已经完全做到的条文删除，而添入新的条文。
