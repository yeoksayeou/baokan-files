　　The Chinese Communist Party is the Inspirer, Organizer, and Leader of Chinese Youth
    ——Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Birth of the Chinese Communist Party
     Feng Wenbin
    Since its birth, the Chinese Communist Party has always cared about the lives and struggles of Chinese youth, constantly inspiring Chinese youth to move forward, and leading Chinese youth from victory to victory. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can Chinese youth achieve victory and liberation, and become the hope and pillar of New China. Only under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Chinese youth movement develop and grow vigorously.
    For the past thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party has led Chinese young workers, young farmers, and students, enabling them to play an extremely important role in the various stages of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, in the long-term struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, in the "May Thirtieth" Movement of 1925, the Northern Expedition War from 1926 to 1927, the Land Revolution War from 1927 to 1936, the "December Ninth" Movement from 1935 to 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945, the People's Liberation War after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea since October 1950, it is because of the correct leadership and education of the Communist Party that Chinese youth have been able to stand so bravely and resolutely at the forefront of the struggle and make such brilliant contributions to the people's revolutionary movement.
    The Chinese Communist Party leads the Chinese youth movement to develop in the only correct direction. The Chinese Communist Party has enabled young workers and young farmers to play an active role in the workers' and peasants' movements, along with adult workers and farmers, and move towards the road to victory. The Chinese Communist Party has also enabled the student movement to move towards the correct path of integration with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The glorious "December Ninth" Movement, the "December First" Movement, and the subsequent patriotic and democratic movements against hunger, civil war, and oppression of Chinese students were all launched and developed under the direct leadership of the Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party constantly calls for revolutionary student youth to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once wisely pointed out: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary youth is whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants. I am putting forward a standard here, which I think is the only standard. What standard should be used to judge whether a youth is revolutionary? What should be used to distinguish him? There is only one standard, and that is to see whether he is willing and practices uniting with the broad masses of workers and peasants." This great instruction has become the direction of struggle for every Chinese youth and the only correct path for the development of the Chinese youth movement. It is also a valuable experience for the achievements of the Chinese youth movement over the past thirty years.
    For the past thirty years, the glorious achievements of the great youth movements have been inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. If the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is absent, or when there are some deviations in the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the youth movement, then the youth movement there will also suffer some degree of loss accordingly.
    The Chinese Communist Party not only leads the youth to engage in the struggle to liberate the motherland, but also leads the youth to engage in the great cause of building the motherland. After the liberation of mainland China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, young workers, together with adult workers, overcame various difficulties, actively restored and developed production, and launched a patriotic production competition. Young farmers actively participated in land reform, and many young farmers became activists in land reform. On the basis of the victory of land reform, young farmers actively participated in militia, launched patriotic production movements or patriotic bumper harvest movements. In schools, the reform of the old curriculum is steadily beginning, and patriotic education is being widely carried out. Under the call of the Party, students are working hard to study for the motherland, so that they can become useful talents for New China. In the old society, the situation of despising and belittling young people, suppressing and restricting their freedom, deceiving and roping them in to serve a few people, and not allowing progressive young people to care about the fate of the country and their own destiny is gone forever. The Communist Party truly regards young people as the masters and hope of the new society. In governments at all levels, in all departments of the New Democratic construction cause, and in the People's Liberation Army, young people account for a large proportion. These young people have become an important force in the cause of national construction and are valued by the Communist Party and the people.
    Why can the Chinese Communist Party play such a great leading role for Chinese youth? Why is the Chinese Communist Party the most important inspirer, organizer, and leader of Chinese youth?
    This is because the Chinese Communist Party is the party of Marxism-Leninism. It educates and leads youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, not with anything else. The Communist Party tirelessly calls on youth to pursue the truth and love the truth; it educates youth to understand the laws of social development, to know where China is going and where the world is going; it educates youth to fight for the great ideal of building a new China and a new world. Under the education of the Communist Party, the political consciousness of Chinese youth has greatly improved. They understand that only by following the Communist Party, following the working class, and moving towards New Democracy, socialism, and communism can the Chinese people and youth be liberated, and China can embark on the road to a bright future. Therefore, they enthusiastically respond to all the calls of the Communist Party. Before the national liberation, many progressive youths under the Kuomintang rule, because they were educated by the Communist Party and realized that the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism would only drag China into the abyss of destruction, disregarded the threat of prison and death, and resolutely fought against the reactionary rule under the leadership of the Communist Party. After the national liberation, young workers learned the truth that labor creates the world, and understood that the working class is the master of New China. They began to engage in production and construction with a completely new attitude towards labor. After the land reform and the education of turning over and complaining, young farmers realized the essence of feudal oppression and greatly improved their class consciousness. They actively responded to the call of the Party and the government, worked hard to produce, and supported the front lines. After receiving the Party's political education, young students began to clear away the various ideological poisons left over by imperialism and feudalism, transformed themselves, and began to establish a revolutionary outlook on life. Therefore, they actively responded to the calls of the Communist Party and the People's Government, participated in military cadre schools, participated in various construction work, worked and studied hard, and obeyed the allocation of the People's Government. All of this is the victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among Chinese youth, and the victory of the Communist Party in educating youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Communist Party is the inspirer, organizer, and leader of Chinese youth because the Chinese Communist Party most correctly represents the interests of the Chinese people—including the interests of the youth. The Party's various policies are formulated in accordance with Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, in accordance with the laws of objective historical development, and at the same time, in accordance with the interests of the people and the opinions of the people. Therefore, it is bound to be enthusiastically supported by the youth. The past fact is that when Chinese youth fight against imperialism and feudalism, they first receive care and encouragement from the Chinese Communist Party. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Communist Party's various policies—national defense construction policies, financial and economic policies, cultural and educational policies—are closely related to the interests of the people and the youth. The Communist Party promulgated various laws and regulations to protect the interests of the people and the youth through the People's Government; the Communist Party carried out labor protection and welfare undertakings for young workers through the administration of industrial and mining enterprises and trade unions; the Communist Party cared about the learning, life, and physical health of students through educational administration and student organizations. From their long-term personal experience, Chinese youth deeply realized that the Chinese Communist Party truly represents the interests of the youth, and that the Chinese Communist Party is the most cordial inspirer and the most trustworthy protector of the youth.
    The Chinese Communist Party strives to unite, educate, and lead the entire generation of youth through youth's own organizations, especially the organizations of youth's advanced elements. In various stages of the Chinese revolution, Chinese youth activists established their own revolutionary organizations with the help and leadership of the Communist Party. From the Chinese Socialist Youth League from 1920 to 1925, the Chinese Communist Youth League from 1925 to 1936, to the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, Youth National Salvation Association, Youth National Salvation Corps, Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team, Democratic Youth League, Democratic Youth League and other organizations from 1936 to 1949, were all organizations through which the Party led the youth movement at that time. The Chinese New Democratic Youth League, formally established in 1949, is a school where the Party educates youth with Marxism-Leninism. So far, the Youth League has more than 4 million members.
    The history of the past thirty years proves that Chinese youth can only achieve complete victory and liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The Chinese Communist Party has opened up an infinitely bright and promising future for Chinese youth.
    How should Chinese youth and members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League celebrate the 30th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party?
    First of all, they should work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, study the history of the Chinese Communist Party, and constantly improve their political and ideological level, striving to become glorious members of the Chinese Communist Party in the future.
    Second, they must actively participate in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and protect the country, resolutely implement the three calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, student youth must actively participate in military cadre schools or resolutely obey the allocation of the People's Government, and young people in factories and rural areas must actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement or the land reform movement. All patriotic youths must actively participate in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, raise political vigilance, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Third, they should better play the role of assistant and reserve army under the leadership of the Party. Stalin said in "The Tasks of the Communist Youth League": "Ensuring the leadership of the Party is the most important thing in all the work of the Youth League. Youth League members should remember that without this leadership, the Youth League cannot accomplish its basic tasks." Comrade Ren Bishi said in his political report at the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League: "Leading cadres and all members of the New Democratic Youth League must clearly and profoundly understand the absolute necessity of accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely implement and obey all the policies and resolutions of the Chinese Communist Party, study the theories of Marxism-Leninism and the style of the Communist Party, and ensure the complete trust of all members and the broad masses of youth in the Chinese Communist Party."
    In the future, Chinese youth and Youth League members will, under the leadership of their inspirer, organizer, and leader—the Chinese Communist Party—move forward together with the people of the whole country to build a New Democratic society and strive for a socialist and communist future!

　　中国共产党是中国青年的鼓舞者、组织者和领导者
    ——纪念中国共产党诞生三十周年
     冯文彬
    中国共产党自从诞生以来，始终关怀着中国青年的生活和斗争，不断地鼓舞着中国青年前进，领导着中国青年从胜利走向胜利。中国青年，只有在中国共产党领导之下，才能获得胜利和解放，成为新中国的希望和栋梁。中国青年运动，也只有在中国共产党的正确领导之下，才能够蓬蓬勃勃地发展与成长。
    三十年来，中国共产党领导中国青年工人、青年农民和学生，使他们在中国新民主主义革命的各个阶段中，在和帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行长期的斗争中，发挥了极重大的作用。从“五四”运动以来，在一九二五年的“五卅”运动、一九二六年到一九二七年的北伐战争、一九二七年到一九三六年的土地革命战争、一九三五年到一九三七年的“一二九”运动、一九三七年到一九四五年的抗日战争、抗日战争结束以后的人民解放战争中，以及在一九五○年十月以来的抗美援朝运动中，都因为有了共产党的正确领导和教育，才使中国青年能这样英勇坚决地站在斗争的最前列，并对人民革命运动有这样光辉的贡献。
    中国共产党领导中国青年运动向着唯一正确的方向发展。中国共产党使青年工人、青年农民，在工人运动与农民运动中，同成年的工人与农民一道，发挥了积极作用，向着胜利的道路前进。中国共产党又使学生运动向着与工农兵结合的正确道路前进。中国学生的光荣的“一二九”运动、“一二一”运动、及以后的反饥饿、反内战、反压迫的民主爱国运动，都是在共产党直接领导下爆发与发展起来的。中国共产党不断地号召：革命的学生青年必须和工农兵相结合，为工农兵服务。
    毛泽东同志曾英明地指出：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的青年之最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行同工农民众相结合。我在这里提出了一个标准，我认为是唯一的标准。看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么作标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意，并且实行不实行同广大的工农群众结合在一块。”这个伟大的指示，成为每个中国青年的奋斗方向，成为中国青年运动唯一正确的发展道路。也就是中国青年运动三十年来所以获得成就的一个宝贵的经验。
    三十年来，历次伟大的青年运动，所以获得光辉的成绩，都是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。如果离开了中国共产党的领导，或者当中国共产党对于青年运动的领导发生某些偏差时，那么，那时那里的青年运动也就会随之而受到某种程度的损失。
    中国共产党不仅领导青年从事解放祖国的斗争，而且，领导青年从事建设祖国的伟大事业。中国大陆解放之后，在共产党领导下，青年工人和成年工人一道，克服各种困难，积极地恢复与发展生产，展开了爱国生产竞赛。青年农民积极参加土地改革、许多青年农民成为土地改革中的积极分子。在土地改革胜利的基础上，青年农民积极参加民兵，展开爱国生产运动或爱国丰产运动。在学校里，正在稳步地开始改革旧的课程，普遍进行爱国主义教育，学生们在党的号召下为了祖国努力学习，使自己成为新中国的有用人材。当美国侵略者扩大朝鲜战争侵占台湾的时候，全国青年在党的领导下，空前热烈地展开抗美援朝保家卫国、保卫世界和平的运动。青年们广泛地订立了爱国公约，并以此作为自己具体的行动纲领。两年以来，全国青年们执行党的号召，在生产战线上、在工作和学习的各个岗位上，都表现了辉煌的成绩。涌现出许多青年的英雄模范。在旧社会那种轻视与卑视青年、压制束缚青年自由、欺骗与笼络青年替少数人效劳、不让要求进步的青年去关心国家和青年自己的命运等等情形，今天是一去不复返了。共产党真正把青年看成新社会未来的主人翁和希望。在各级人民政府中，在新民主主义建设事业的各个部门中，在人民解放军中，青年都占着很大的比例，这些青年，成为国家建设事业中的重要力量，受到共产党和人民的重视。
    为什么中国共产党能对中国青年起了这样伟大的领导作用？为什么中国共产党是中国青年的最重要的鼓舞者、组织者和领导者？
    这是因为，中国共产党是马克思列宁主义的党。它是以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想而不是以别的东西教育青年与领导青年的。共产党始终不倦地号召青年追求真理、热爱真理；教育青年认识社会发展的规律，认识中国将往那里去，世界将往那里去；教育青年为建设新中国、新世界的远大理想而奋斗。在共产党这样的教育之下，中国青年的政治觉悟大大提高，懂得只有跟着共产党走，跟着工人阶级走，向着新民主主义和社会主义、共产主义走，中国人民和青年才能得到解放，中国才能走上光明大道，因此，他们热烈地响应共产党的一切号召。在全国解放以前，在国民党统治下的许多进步青年，因为受到共产党的教育，认清了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治只会把中国拖到灭亡的深渊，就不顾牢狱与死刑的威胁，前仆后继，坚决在共产党的领导之下和反动统治作斗争。在全国解放之后，青年工人们学习了劳动创造世界的真理，懂得了工人阶级是新中国的主人，他们开始以完全新的劳动态度来从事生产建设。青年农民们经过了土地改革，翻身诉苦的教育之后，认识了封建压迫的本质，大大提高了阶级觉悟，他们就积极响应党和政府的号召，努力生产，支援前线。青年学生们受到了党的政治教育后，开始扫清了帝国主义与封建主义所遗留的各种思想毒害，改造了自己，开始建立了革命的人生观。因此他们就积极响应共产党和人民政府的号召，参加军事干部学校，参加各种建设工作，努力工作学习，服从人民政府分配。所有这些，都是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想在中国青年中的胜利，都是共产党以马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想教育青年的胜利。
    共产党是中国青年的鼓舞者、组织者和领导者，这是因为中国共产党是最正确地代表中国人民的利益——包括青年的利益的。党的各种政策，是依照马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想、依照客观历史发展的法则来制订的，同时，又是依照人民群众的利益和人民群众的意见来制订的。因此它必然受到青年们的热烈拥护。过去的事实是：当中国青年和帝国主义、封建主义作斗争的时候，首先就从中国共产党那里得到关怀和鼓励。在中央人民政府成立之后，共产党的各种政策——国防建设政策、财政经济政策、文化教育政策，都是密切关系人民和青年的利益的。共产党通过人民政府颁布了保护人民和青年利益的各种法令；共产党通过工矿企业行政和工会，为青年工人进行了劳动保护和生活福利事业；共产党通过教育行政和学生团体关心学生的学习、生活和身体的健康。中国青年从长期亲身的经历中，深深地体会到：中国共产党是真正代表青年利益的，中国共产党是青年最亲切的鼓舞者和最可信赖的保护者。
    中国共产党努力经过青年自己的组织，特别是青年的先进分子的组织，去团结、教育和领导整个青年的一代。在中国革命的各个阶段中，中国青年积极分子在共产党的帮助与领导下，建立了青年自己的革命组织。从一九二○年到一九二五年的中国社会主义青年团，从一九二五年到一九三六年的中国共产主义青年团，从一九三六年到一九四九年的中华民族解放先锋队、青年救国会、青年救国团、青年抗日先锋队、民主青年联盟、民主青年团等组织，都是当时党领导青年运动的组织。一九四九年正式成立的中国新民主主义青年团是党以马克思列宁主义教育青年的学校。到目前为止，青年团已有四百多万团员。
    三十年来的历史证明：中国青年只有在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，才能获得彻底的胜利和解放。中国共产党替中国青年开辟了无限光明远大的前程。
    中国青年和中国新民主主义青年团员，应该怎样来庆祝中国共产党诞生的三十周年纪念呢？
    首先，应当努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，学习中国共产党的历史，要不断地提高自己的政治思想水平，争取将来成为光荣的中国共产党党员。
    第二、要积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，坚决执行抗美援朝总会的三项号召，学生青年要踊跃参加军事干部学校或坚决服从人民政府的分配，工厂和农村青年要积极参加爱国增产运动或土地改革运动。一切爱国青年都要积极参加镇压反革命的运动，提高政治警惕，巩固人民民主专政。
    第三、应当更好地在党的领导下，发挥助手和后备军的作用。斯大林在论“共产主义青年团的任务”中说：“保证党的领导是青年团全部工作中最主要的一件事。青年团员应当记着，没有这一种领导，青年团就不能完成它的基本任务。”任弼时同志在中国新民主主义青年团第一次代表大会上的政治报告中说过：“新民主主义青年团的领导干部及全体团员必须明确深刻地认识接受中国共产党的领导的绝对必要性，坚决执行和服从中国共产党的一切政策和决议，学习马克思列宁主义的理论和共产党的作风，保证全体团员及广大青年对于中国共产党的完全信任。”
    中国青年和青年团员，今后将在自己的鼓舞者、组织者和领导者——中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民一道，为建设新民主主义社会，为争取社会主义共产主义的将来，向前迈进！
