　　The CPC Hebei Provincial Committee has put forward the following specific measures for commemorating "July 1st":

　　1. The local, municipal, and county committees should immediately organize preparatory committees for commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the CPC.

　　2. All levels of party members and cadres throughout the province, from mid-June to the end of June, should organize and plan the study of various important papers related to the commemoration of "July 1st." Methods such as special reports, individual reading, combined discussions, and recollections should be adopted to enable party members and cadres to truly understand the spirit of the documents.

　　3. Provincial newspapers, municipal newspapers, and local municipal committee-published branch newsletters, as well as certain industrial and mining newsletters, should conduct propaganda related to the commemoration of "July 1st" from mid-June. They should systematically organize and publish various recollections about the party's struggle history, recollections of revolutionary martyrs, model party members, and the organizational sacrifices and struggles for the people's freedom and happiness, and appropriately publish the glorious deeds of existing model party members in the region.

　　4. All party members and cadres, especially party reporters and propagandists, should use various methods to publicize the history of the party to the masses under the planned leadership of party committees and branches. Within June, at various larger mass gatherings in cities, counties, and districts, the city and county party committees should make a prepared report to the masses on the party's glorious struggle history.

　　5. On July 1st, all party branches should convene a celebration meeting for all party members and may also invite the voluntary participation of the masses. At the celebration meeting, party committees at all levels should connect the local party organization's development history and the glorious deeds of sacrifice and struggle for the people with the current thinking of party members and various current tasks. They should call on all party members to highly demonstrate their enthusiasm and backbone leadership in promoting patriotic pacts, donating airplanes and artillery, giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and selling and storing cotton, among other major current tasks.
