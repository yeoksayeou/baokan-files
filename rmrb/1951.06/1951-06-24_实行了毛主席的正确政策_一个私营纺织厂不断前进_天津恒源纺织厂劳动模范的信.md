Implementing Chairman Mao's Correct Policies
    A Private Textile Factory Moves Forward
    ——Letter from Labor Models of Tianjin Hengyuan Textile Factory

Respected Chairman Mao:

On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, with great excitement and gratitude, we report to you on the situation of our factory.

We are several workers and staff members of the Tianjin private Hengyuan Textile Factory. Last year, we were selected as special-class and first-class labor models in Tianjin. For more than two years, under your glorious illumination, we have personally witnessed the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Hengyuan Textile Factory. The unit output of 20-count cotton yarn has increased from 0.6 pounds to 1.12 pounds, and the output per machine of 12-pound city cloth has increased from 50 yards to 82 yards. Before liberation, we produced a maximum of 446 bolts of cloth per day, but now we have reached over 900 bolts. We have successfully held labor-capital consultation meetings and united the capitalists in our factory. Last September, Manager Bian of our factory stated at the factory's celebration meeting that he would use all net profits to expand reproduction. On the other hand, we have also seen significant improvements in our material and cultural lives. In the past, we were disgusted as soon as we entered the dining hall because the food was so bad. Now we can often eat fish, meat, and chicken. 1,200 of us participate in spare-time schools (out of more than 1,700 factory workers). In the past year or so, 40 illiterate people have reached the cultural level of elementary school graduates.

This New Year, we summarized our work. We all unanimously understood that you led the People's Liberation Army to liberate us, and we became the masters of the new society. At the same time, we worked hard according to the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, as you instructed. This is the main reason for our achievements.

Including 1949, the shareholders of Hengyuan received a total of 2.9 billion in dividends. The capitalists used 2.2 billion to improve the workers' welfare facilities, built more than 20 new rooms, bought 5,000 new spindles, more than 100,000 bobbins, and more than a dozen motors and other parts. More than 9 billion yuan was left over, of which 1 billion yuan was used to install temporary ventilation equipment, 3 billion yuan was prepared to improve machinery and equipment, 1 billion yuan was invested in the Tianjin Investment Company, and 2 billion yuan was used to repair the dangerous roof of the opening and cleaning room, rebuild the heating boiler room, and purchase a new heating boiler. It is planned to install formal ventilation equipment with another 3 to 4 billion yuan by the beginning of next year; and recently, 1.5 billion yuan was donated to purchase an airplane. We believe that these figures illustrate the correctness of your policies and the victory of your thought.

All the workers and staff of our factory are excited and honored by this victory. We are unanimously determined to work harder to overcome difficulties and increase production; and to use our greatest strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea to defend our victory. According to the still incomplete statistics, this time our donations for airplanes and artillery have been nearly 400 million yuan, most of which is due to the bonuses we have received from improving production and business.

We assure you that we will humbly and better unite all the workers and staff of the factory, maintain the glorious title of national model trade union, and maintain the glorious title of Tianjin second-class model factory. We are now working hard to improve technology, improve mechanical efficiency, and improve output quality, and vigorously carry out cultural and technical studies. We are currently preparing a secondary-level spare-time technical school to train technical personnel, carry out rationalization proposal activities, adhere to patriotic labor competitions, and vigorously carry out savings campaigns to save raw cotton.

We are now learning and repairing machines. We will arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and your thought in the above direction, learn politics, culture, and technology well, repair machines well, and prepare to move forward by leaps and bounds to strive for the victory of our country's economic construction!

We wish you good health!

　　实行了毛主席的正确政策
    一个私营纺织厂不断前进
    ——天津恒源纺织厂劳动模范的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在党成立三十周年纪念日的前夕，我们怀着万分兴奋和感激的心情，向您报告我们厂的情况。
    我们是天津私营恒源纺织厂的几个工人、职员，去年我们被选为天津市的特等和一等劳动模范。两年多以来，在您的光辉照耀之下，我们亲眼看到了恒源纺织厂发生的巨大的变化。二十支棉纱的单位产量从零点六磅提高到一点一二磅，十二磅市布每台产量从五十码提高到八十二码。解放前，我们每天最多出四百四十六匹布，现在已经达到了九百匹以上。我们开好了劳资协商会议，团结了我们厂的资方。去年九月，我厂边经理在全厂庆功大会上表示，要把全部纯利润扩大再生产。另一方面，我们在物质生活和文化生活方面也有了显著的改善。从前我们一到饭厅就腻了，因为饭太坏了。现在我们能经常吃到鱼、肉、鸡。我们有一千二百人参加了业余学校（全厂职工一千七百余人）。一年多来，有四十个文盲已有了小学毕业的文化程度。
    今年新年时，我们曾总结过我们的工作。我们大家都一致了解了：您领导着人民解放军解放了我们，我们成了新社会的主人，同时我们又按照您所嘱咐的发展生产、劳资两利的政策努力作了，这就是我们获得成绩的最主要的原因。
    连一九四九年在内，恒源的股东共提了二十九亿的股息，资方用二十二亿改善了工人的福利设备，新盖了二十多间房，新买了五千锭子，十万多纱管，十余个马达等机件。还剩了九十多亿元，用了十亿装设临时的通风设备，准备用三十亿元改善机器设备。用了十亿元投资了天津市投资公司，用二十亿元修理清花间危险的房顶、重建暖汽锅炉房和新购一部暖汽锅炉；准备到明年初再用三、四十亿元装设正式的通风装备；最近又用十五亿元捐献了一架飞机。我们认为这些数字就说明您的政策的正确，就说明您的思想的胜利。
    我们全厂职工都为这一胜利感到兴奋和光荣，我们一致决心更加努力克服困难，提高生产；并且用最大力量支援朝鲜的志愿军保卫我们的胜利。就以现在还不完全的统计，这次我们捐献飞机大炮的款项已将近四亿元，其中大部是由于我们搞好生产，搞好业务所得到的奖金。
    我们向您保证，我们一定虚心地更好地团结全厂职工，保持全国模范工会的光荣称号，保持天津市二等模范厂的光荣称号。我们现在正在为提高技术，改进机械效率，提高产量质量，大力开展文化技术学习而努力。目前正筹备一中级的业余技术学校，培养技术人员，开展合理化建议运动，坚持爱国主义劳动竞赛，大力开展节约运动，节省原棉。
    我们现在正在进行学习和检修机器。我们将本着以上方向，用马克思列宁主义和您的思想武装我们自己，学好政治、文化、技术，修好机器，准备大步前进，为我们祖国经济建设的胜利而奋斗！
    祝您健康！
