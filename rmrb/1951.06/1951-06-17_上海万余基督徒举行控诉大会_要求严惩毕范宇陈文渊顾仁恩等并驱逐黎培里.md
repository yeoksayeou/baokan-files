Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 16th. The various Christian churches and organizations in Shanghai jointly held an accusation meeting on the 10th. Over ten thousand people including staff members, pastors, elders, and church members from various churches and organizations participated in the meeting.

Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Christian Resist-America Aid-Korea Three-Self Reform Movement Committee, made a general accusation of the crimes of American imperialism using Christianity to invade China. He cited many facts to illustrate that the purpose of American imperialism in sending missionaries to China was to use Christianity as a tool for its invasion of China and to turn China into a colony of the United States. Wu Yaozong further pointed out that the "Ecumenical Movement" promoted by American imperialism was a cover for its use of Christianity to invade the whole world. He said: We must call on all good Christians in the world to unite and smash the conspiracy of American imperialism.

Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China District of the Chinese Methodist Episcopal Church, after exposing the crimes of American imperialist missionaries Huang Ansu and An Dison in carrying out sabotage activities, focused on reviewing his mistake of performing the baptism ceremony for the bandit Chiang Kai-shek. He announced on behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the meeting that the church membership of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and the bandit Song Meiling had been revoked.

Xu Hua, President of the China General Association of Seventh-day Adventists, pointed out that American missionaries and the American government are two in one. For example, the American missionary Gan Shengdian, who had preached in North and Northeast China for many years, was transferred back to the U.S. State Department as a translator specializing in intelligence about China because of his meritorious intelligence work.

American imperialism once used the Christian Literature Society to carry out cultural aggression against our country. Hu Zuyin, the General Secretary of the Society, accused at the meeting: From the establishment of the Christian Literature Society to the present, nearly two thousand kinds of books and periodicals have been published in the past sixty-five years, of which more than 60% were directly translated from the United States. These books and periodicals mainly promoted anti-Soviet and anti-communist ideas and advocated the decadent "American way of life." Timothy Richard, the former General Secretary of the Christian Literature Society and a famous imperialist, once said, "To eliminate the resentment of the Chinese people, that is, to use the method of writing." This shows that the purpose of imperialism in establishing cultural undertakings in China is to eliminate the Chinese people's resistance to their aggression.

Deng Yuzhi, General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese Christian Young Women's Association, exposed the purpose of American imperialism in establishing the YMCA in China, which was to attempt to use Christianity as a third line to deceive pure Chinese youth and eliminate their patriotic consciousness and enthusiasm. Wu Yongquan, the representative of the Christian student associations of various universities, used facts to illustrate that the student associations were a tool for American imperialism to attempt to use students to carry out anti-communist and anti-Soviet activities. For example, foreign staff members of the association, such as Ai Deli and Kong Baoluo, had arranged special agents within the association to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Ai Deli once shamelessly slandered the patriotic parade in Nanjing on May 20th as a "student riot."

Wu Gaozi, President of the National Christian Council of China, Cui Xianxiang, Vice President, and Jia Yuming, Chairman of the China Christian Elder's General Assembly, also accused the crimes of imperialist elements Bi Fanyu, Mu Tianen, etc. at the meeting. At the same time, they reviewed their past mistakes of being instructed and used by imperialism. Jia Yuming reflected on his mistake of attending the World Christian Federation held in the Netherlands in August 1948, which was hosted by the United States. At the meeting, he was elected as one of the vice-chairmen of the federation. The federation later issued an anti-Soviet and anti-communist declaration.

The meeting finally adopted five resolutions: (1) Request the People's Government to severely punish American imperialist elements Bi Fanyu, Mu Tianen, Zhuo Wei, etc. according to law; (2) Request the People's Government to severely punish the KMT spies Chen Wenyuan, Gu Ren'en, Xiang Jun, etc. in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries"; (3) Continue to launch the accusation movement, eliminate all American imperialist influence within Christianity, and expose and eliminate imperialist elements and their running dogs within Christianity; (4) Support patriotic and religious Catholic believers in expelling the imperialist element Libei Ri from the country; (5) Actively promote the Three-Self Reform Movement and establish a Chinese Christian church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating.

　　上海万余基督徒举行控诉大会
    要求严惩毕范宇陈文渊顾仁恩等并驱逐黎培里
    【新华社上海十六日电】在上海的中国基督教各教会各团体于十日联合举行控诉大会。参加大会的有各教会、团体的工作人员和牧师、长老、教徒共一万多人。
    中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹委会主席吴耀宗对美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国的罪行作了总的控诉。他举了很多事实，说明美帝国主义派传教士到中国来传教，其目的就是把基督教当作它侵略中国的工具，使中国变成美国的殖民地。吴耀宗进一步指出：美帝国主义所提倡的“基督教普世运动”，是它利用基督教侵略全世界的幌子。他说：我们要号召全世界善良的基督徒联合起来，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
    中华基督教卫理公会华北教区会督江长川在揭发了该会美帝国主义传教士黄安素、安迪生进行破坏活动的罪行以后，着重地检讨了他曾替蒋匪介石施行入教洗礼的错误，他代表卫理公会在会上宣布：已开除蒋匪介石和宋匪美龄的教籍。
    基督复临安息日会中华总会会长徐华指出：美国传教士与美国政府是二位一体的，例如在我国华北、东北传教多年的美国传教士甘盛典，就因做情报工作有功，被调回美国国务院专任有关中国情报的翻译工作。
    美帝国主义曾利用基督教广学会对我国进行文化侵略。该会总干事胡祖荫在会上控诉说：从广学会成立到现在，六十五年中共出版了近二千种书刊，其中百分之六十以上是直接从美国翻译过来的，这些书刊都是以宣传反苏反共和提倡腐朽的“美国生活方式”为其主要内容。广学会前总干事、著名的帝国主义分子李提摩太曾说：“要消灭中国人民的忿恨，那就是用文字的方法。”这说明了帝国主义在中国创办文化事业，其目的就是要消灭中国人民对它们的侵略的反抗。
    中华基督教女青年会全国协会总干事邓裕志揭露美帝国主义在中国创办青年会的目的，是企图以基督教为第三条路线，来欺骗纯洁的中国青年，消灭他们爱国的意识和热情。各大学基督徒学生联合会代表吴永泉用事实说明学生联合会是美帝国主义企图利用学生进行反共反苏活动的工具。例如该会外籍工作人员艾得理、孔保罗等曾在会内布置特务分子，进行反革命活动。艾得理就曾无耻地诬蔑南京“五、二○”爱国大游行为“学生暴动”。
    中华全国基督教协进会会长吴高梓、副会长崔宪详、中国基督教长老总会主席贾玉铭等也在会上控诉了帝国主义分子毕范宇、慕天恩等的罪恶，同时检讨了自己过去受帝国主义指使和利用的错误。贾玉铭反省了他在一九四八年八月出席美国主持的在荷兰举行的万国基督教联合会的错误，在会中他被推为该会副主席之一，该会在会后曾发表反苏反共的宣言。
    大会最后通过了五项决议：（一）要求人民政府将美帝国主义分子毕范宇、慕天恩、卓伟等依法严办；（二）要求人民政府将美蒋特务陈文渊、顾仁恩、项军等依照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”严厉惩办；（三）继续展开控诉运动，肃清基督教内一切美帝国主义影响，检举并肃清基督教内帝国主义分子及其走狗；（四）支援爱国爱教的天主教徒把帝国主义分子黎培里驱逐出境；（五）积极推进三自革新运动，建立中国基督徒自治、自养、自传的教会。
