　　Senior Beijing Opera Figures Wang Yaoqing, Shang Heyu, and Others
    Decide to Hold Charity Performance to Donate Airplanes
    Wang Yaoqing, a senior figure in Beijing Opera, principal of the Chinese Opera Research Institute's Experimental Opera School, along with famous martial artist Shang Heyu, and Ma Decheng, Zhang Dejun, Hao Shouchen, Tan Xiaopei, Bao Jixiang, Liu Xikui and more than twenty others gathered on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss responding to the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. All those present were over sixty years old, having retired from the stage for more than ten to twenty years, but their patriotic enthusiasm was high. They unanimously decided to hold a charity performance, using the income to purchase weapons to support the war against America. They stated: Now that the country is liberated, artists have turned over and become masters of China, and they should stand in the position of masters and use practical actions to cherish our country. Shang Heyu said, "Don't think I'm eighty years old, I must participate in the charity performance and donate airplanes to defend the country." The seventy-six-year-old Ma Decheng and the sixty-nine-year-old Hao Shouchen both announced at the meeting: In order to participate in the charity performance, they would not hesitate to shave off their beards of more than ten years. The meeting finally decided to hold the first joint charity performance with the teachers and students of the Experimental Opera School on the evening of the 17th at the Dazhong Theater outside Qianmen, with Shang Heyu, Ma Decheng, Hao Shouchen, Zhang Dejun, Guan Dayuan and others respectively performing plays such as "Jinyang Palace," "Burning of the Bailiang Tower," "Famen Temple," "Wu Song Beats the Shopkeeper," and "Selling the Horse with a Whip."

　　首都京剧界前辈王瑶卿尚和玉等
    决定举行捐献飞机义演
    首都京剧界前辈、中国戏曲研究院戏曲实验学校校长王瑶卿，名武生尚和玉和马德成、张德俊、郝寿臣、谭小培、鲍吉祥、刘喜奎等二十余人于八日下午聚会，商讨响应捐献飞机大炮运动。到会者都年在六十岁以上，脱离舞台生活已十数年至二十多年，但爱国情绪高涨，一致决定举行义演，以收入购买武器，支援抗美战争。他们表示：现在国家解放了，艺人翻了身成了中国的主人，就应当站在主人翁的地位，用实际行动来爱护我们的国家。尚和玉说：“别看我已八十岁了，我一定要参加义演，捐献飞机保卫国家。”七十六岁的马德成和六十九岁的郝寿臣，都在会上宣布：为了参加义演，不惜刮掉十多年来的胡子。会议最后决定与戏曲实验学校师生，十七日晚在前门外大众剧场举行首次联合义演，由尚和玉、马德成、郝寿臣、张德俊、贯大元等分别演出《晋阳宫》、《火烧百凉楼》、《法门寺》、《武松打店》、《当锏卖马》等剧。
