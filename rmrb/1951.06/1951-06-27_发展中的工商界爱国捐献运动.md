　　The Developing Patriotic Donation Movement in Industry and Commerce
      Lin Hong
    After the General Association Against American Aggression and Aid Korea issued a call on June 1st to promote patriotic conventions, donate airplanes and cannons, and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, industrial and commercial circles in various regions responded enthusiastically and quickly launched a large-scale patriotic donation movement. The Beijing industrial and commercial community, which was the first to initiate the donation movement nationwide, decided on the 10th to donate 27 airplanes; the Wuhan industrial and commercial community decided on the 13th to donate 30 airplanes; the Chongqing industrial and commercial community decided on the 14th to donate 20 airplanes; the Shenyang industrial and commercial community decided on the 17th to donate 30 airplanes; and the Tianjin industrial and commercial community had successively donated 31 airplanes, 5 cannons, 4 anti-aircraft guns, and 1 tank by the 22nd. As of the 22nd, according to incomplete statistics from 31 cities, the number of weapons initially decided to be donated by industrial and commercial circles was: 221 airplanes, 9 cannons, 7 anti-aircraft guns, and 1 tank. Under the leadership of local federations of industry and commerce or preparatory committees of federations of industry and commerce (hereinafter referred to as federations of industry and commerce), the patriotic donation movement in industrial and commercial circles is developing extensively and deeply.

    The patriotic donation movement in industrial and commercial circles in various regions is generally combined with the correct policy of increasing production, improving management, and reducing waste, and is also carried out on the basis of mobilizing the masses. After the General Association Against American Aggression and Aid Korea issued its call, industrial and commercial federations in many cities convened various large and small meetings. After discussions and deliberations, it was generally recognized that this patriotic donation movement should not only mobilize the strength of industrial and commercial circles to supply more airplanes, cannons, and other weapons to the Korean front to win an early victory in the war against American aggression, but also raise the political awareness of industrial and commercial circles and promote the country's economic construction through this movement. Therefore, after many city industrial and commercial federations discussed and adopted preliminary donation plans at representative meetings of various industries in the local industrial and commercial circles or representative meetings of industrial and commercial circles to resist American aggression and aid Korea, in order to enable the patriotic donation movement in industrial and commercial circles to develop universally and deeply, so that every industrial and commercial household can follow the spirit of the call of the General Association Against American Aggression and Aid Korea, and formulate practical and feasible donation plans based on their own circumstances, they also adopted some positive and effective methods, which are worthy of mutual learning by industrial and commercial circles in various regions.

    First, under the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, establish specialized organizations to lead and promote the donation movement in industrial and commercial circles. Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, Zhangjiakou, Baotou, Guihua, Anshan, and Nanhui in southern Jiangsu have successively established committees or donation committees for increasing production and donating to resist American aggression and aid Korea in industrial and commercial circles. Beijing also absorbed activists who emerged in the early stage of the donation movement to participate in the production increase and donation committee, and divided all the members into seven groups, each in charge of leading the donation work of 20 industries.

    Second, in order to enable the donation plans of industrial and commercial households to be combined with the policy of increasing production, improving management, and reducing waste, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce first helped three industries and some industrial and commercial households formulate donation plans in the early stage of the movement, cultivated them as models, and then promoted them at the mobilization meeting of representatives of various industries in the city's industrial and commercial circles.

    Third, through labor-management consultation meetings, obtain the support of workers and shop assistants to increase production, improve management, and reduce waste, thereby realizing the donation plan. For example, in order to complete the plan to donate 400 million yuan in half a year, Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Shop in Beijing added a clause to the patriotic convention after labor-management consultation: "Strive to increase the business turnover in the second half of the year by 4 billion yuan compared with the same period last year." In order to ensure the completion of this business plan, the employees of the shop launched a business competition in early June. The employees of Renli Industrial Company in Tianjin put forward a guarantee to the capitalists to support their patriotic actions. The employees of the company's fourth workshop have automatically proposed to increase output by 30% in June, July, and August.

    Fourth, in order to promote the enthusiasm of patriotism, many local industrial and commercial circles launched patriotic donation competitions between industries or between industrial and commercial households, and formulated reward measures. Some local industrial and commercial circles also issued patriotic donation challenges to the entire province or region. For example, the north and south native produce industry in Tianjin donated a cannon and proposed to have a friendly competition with warehouses and tea merchants of comparable financial strength. In order to encourage mutual competition among various industries, the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce prepared trophies, which are prepared to be awarded to actively donating industries and industrial and commercial households.

　　发展中的工商界爱国捐献运动
      林洪
    六月一日，抗美援朝总会发出推行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召后，各地工商界热烈响应，迅速掀起了一个规模巨大的爱国捐献运动。在全国范围内第一个发起捐献运动的北京工商界，于十日决定捐献飞机二十七架；武汉工商界于十三日决定捐献飞机三十架；重庆工商界于十四日决定捐献飞机二十架；沈阳工商界于十七日决定捐献飞机三十架；天津工商界到二十二日为止，已陆续捐献飞机三十一架，大炮五门、高射炮四门和坦克一辆。截至二十二日为止，根据三十一个城市的不完全统计，工商界已初步决定捐献的武器数目是：飞机二百二十一架，大炮九门，高射炮七门，坦克一辆。在各地工商联合会或工商联合会筹备会（以下简称工商联）的领导下，工商界的爱国捐献运动正广泛深入发展中。
    各地工商界的爱国捐献运动，一般是和增加生产、改善经营及减少浪费的正确方针相结合的，也是在发动群众的基础上开展起来的。在抗美援朝总会的号召发出后，许多城市的工商联都召开了各种大小型会议，经过讨论和酝酿后，一般都认识到：这一次的爱国捐献运动，不但要动员工商界的力量，为朝鲜前线供给更多的飞机、大炮等杀敌武器，以争取抗美战争的早日胜利，而且要通过这一次的运动，提高工商界的政治认识，并把国家的经济建设推进一步。因此，许多城市的工商联在当地工商界各行业的代表会议或工商界抗美援朝代表会议上，讨论通过了初步的捐献计划后，为了使工商界的爱国捐献运动普遍深入发展下去，每一工商户都能遵照抗美援朝总会号召的精神，根据本身的情况订出切实可行的捐献计划，还采取了一些积极有效的办法，值得各地工商界互相学习。
    第一、在工商联的领导下，建立专门领导和推动工商界捐献运动的组织。北京、天津、沈阳、重庆、张家口、包头、归绥、鞍山和苏南的南汇等地已先后成立了工商界抗美援朝增产捐献委员会或捐献委员会。北京还吸收捐献运动初期涌现出来的积极分子参加了增产捐献委员会，并把所有的委员分成七组，分工领导二十个行业的捐献工作。
    第二、为了使工商户的捐献计划能够与增加生产、改善经营和减少浪费的方针相结合，北京工商联在运动初期首先帮助三个行业和一些工商户订立了捐献计划，培养他们作为典型，然后在全市工商界各行业代表的动员会上予以推广。
    第三、通过劳资协商会议，取得工人、店员的支持，来增加生产，改进经营，减少浪费，从而实现捐献计划。如北京瑞蚨祥绸布店为了完成半年捐献四亿元的计划，经过劳资协商后，双方都在爱国公约中增加了一条：“争取下半年的营业流水比去年同一时期增加四十亿元。”该店职工为了保证这一营业计划的完成，于六月初旬已展开了业务竞赛。天津仁立实业公司的职工，向资方提出了支持他们的爱国行动的保证。该公司第四车间的职工已自动提出，要在六、七、八三个月中提高产量百分之三十。
    第四、为了发扬爱国主义的热情，许多地方的工商界在行业与行业间、或工商户之间展开了爱国捐献竞赛，并订出了奖励办法。有些地方的工商界还向全省或全区发出了爱国捐献挑战书。如天津市南北土产业捐献了大炮一门，并提出愿与资力相当的货栈、茶商两业作友谊竞赛。天津工商联为鼓励各行业互相竞赛，制备了锦标，准备授予积极捐献的行业和工商户。
