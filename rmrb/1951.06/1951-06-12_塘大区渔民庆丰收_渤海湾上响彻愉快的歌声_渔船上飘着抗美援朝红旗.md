　　Tang District Fishermen Celebrate Bumper Harvest
　  Joyful Songs Resound Over Bohai Bay
    Anti-American, Aid-Korea Red Flags Fly on Fishing Boats
    The fishermen of Tang District in Tianjin are celebrating another bumper harvest this year. According to preliminary statistics from the local aquatic products company, since the fishing season began this spring, fishermen have caught over 18.85 million pounds of various fish and shrimp. The output of prawns is particularly high, about six to seven times more than last year.
    Tang District is an important fish-producing area in North China. Beicang Town in this district is one of the most important fishing ports on the Bohai Bay. At its peak, there were more than 30,000 fishing households and more than 1,300 three-masted fishing boats. During the Japanese occupation and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the fishing industry in Tang District suffered great devastation. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government in the form of grain and loan assistance, the fishing industry in Tang District gradually began to recover. In 1950, the local People's Government formally established a fish market in Tang District, which reduced the exploitation of fishermen by fish shops. As a result, fishermen's enthusiasm for production increased, and they actively went out to sea to fish, achieving a bumper harvest last year. Last winter, the local People's Government also issued loans twice to fishermen who lacked funds, enabling fishermen throughout the district to repair their fishing boats and replace them with new fishing nets this year.
    Now is the peak season for fish production. Countless fishing boats are often moored off the coast of Beicang Town in the Bohai Bay. Every day, as the east is just beginning to dawn, and the boundless sea and sky are barely distinguishable, the fishermen immediately board their fishing boats and sail out to sea on the surging tides and the gentle morning breeze. Patches of white sail suddenly appear on the turquoise sea. As the sun sets in the west, fishing boats laden with fish and shrimp return to port in succession, forming a line several miles long. A red flag bearing the words "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country" flies from the leading boat. After the boats are docked, prawns, yellow croakers, large fish as tall as a person, and sea crabs, etc., are carried in large baskets into the fish market on each side. For a time, the joyful songs and clamor of the fishermen resound on the boats and on the shore. This year, the fishermen's harvests have generally been good. Hang Guoming, a fisherman from the district, once caught 25,000 pairs of prawns in a single catch this year. Chu Yutang, a fisherman from Beicang Town, has caught more than 12,000 pounds of prawns (three to three and a half pairs per pound) from his fishing boat since he went to sea. Gu Yunfeng, another fisherman, caught more than 100,000 pounds of yellow croaker from his fishing boat in less than half a month.
    Due to the bumper harvest of fish, the transportation and sales of fish products has become a problem that needs to be solved first. With the strong organization of the local aquatic products company, since May, Tang District has been shipping three railroad cars' worth of fresh fish and shrimp to Shanghai every day. On May Day, the total amount of fish products marketed in the district was 50,000 to 60,000 pounds for fresh shrimp alone. On that day, in addition to using 33 large boats and dozens of trucks and carts to transport the fish and goods to Tianjin and Beijing in a timely manner, the local aquatic products company also transported two trains to the Northeast. The large quantity of fish products exported from the district this year is also a rare phenomenon in recent years. Due to the brisk sales, fish prices have not plummeted due to the bumper harvest, and the income of fishermen has been guaranteed. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 塘大区渔民庆丰收  渤海湾上响彻愉快的歌声  渔船上飘着抗美援朝红旗

　　塘大区渔民庆丰收
　  渤海湾上响彻愉快的歌声        
    渔船上飘着抗美援朝红旗
    天津市塘大区的渔民，今年又一次得到丰收。据当地水产公司的初步统计：自今春渔民开始捕鱼以来，到现在止，渔民已捕获各种鱼、虾一千八百多万斤。其中尤以对虾的产量最大，约较去年多六、七倍。
    塘大区是华北重要的鱼产区。该区的北塘镇是渤海湾上重要的渔港之一，最盛时有渔民三万多户，有三桅大渔船一千三百多只。日寇占领时期和国民党反动政府统治时期，塘大区渔业遭受了很大的摧残。解放后，塘大区渔业在人民政府贷粮、贷款扶持下渐有起色。一九五○年当地人民政府在塘大区正式设立鱼市场，又减轻了鱼店对渔民的剥削。因此，渔民生产情绪提高，积极出海捕鱼，去年就获得了一次丰收。去年冬季，当地人民政府又曾两次发放贷款给缺少资金的渔民，使得全区渔民今年都能修整渔船和换了新的渔网。
    现在正是鱼产旺季，在渤海湾北塘镇的海边，经常停泊着无数条渔船。每天当东方微明，无际的海水和天色刚可分辨的时候，渔民们立即驾上渔船，趁着汹涌的海潮和清晨的微风向海中驶去。碧绿色的海面上，顿时浮现出片片白帆。夕阳西下时，满载鱼、虾的渔船，鱼贯回港，行列长达数里。为首的一只船上，飘展着一面“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的红旗。船只靠岸后，对虾、黄花鱼、半人高的大海鱼和海蟹等等，一大筐一大筐地被抬进每边上的渔市场。一时，船上和岸上响彻了渔民们愉快的歌声和喧嚷声。今年渔民出海，收获一般都好。该区渔民杭国明，今年曾经一次捕得对虾两万五千对。北塘镇渔民褚玉堂的一条渔船，从出海到现在，共捕了一万二千多斤对虾（每斤三对至三对半）。另一渔民谷云峰的一条渔船，出海不到半月，共获得黄花鱼十几万斤。
    由于鱼产的丰收，鱼产的运销工作成为首先需要解决的问题。在当地水产公司的大力组织下，五月以来，塘大区每天有三节车箱容量的鲜鱼、虾被运往上海。“五一”节那天，全区上市的鱼产仅鲜虾一项即有五、六万斤。那天，当地水产公司除用三十三只大船和几十辆汽车、大车将鱼货及时向天津、北京赶运外，还运了两列车往东北。今年该区鱼产外销数量之大，也是近年罕有的现象。由于外销畅旺，鱼价未因丰收猛跌，渔民的收入得到了保障。（新华社）
