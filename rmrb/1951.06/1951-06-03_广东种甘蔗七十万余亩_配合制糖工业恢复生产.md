Guangdong Province has planted over 700,000 mu of sugarcane this year, an increase of more than 80,000 mu compared to last year, and an increase of 130,000 mu compared to 1949 when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled. Currently, the sugarcane seedlings have emerged to a height of over one foot and are growing very vigorously. Farmers are full of confidence in a good sugarcane harvest this year. Guangdong Province ranks first in sugarcane production in mainland China. The peak sugarcane planting area reached approximately 900,000 mu. Due to the Kuomintang reactionary rule's cruel exploitation and oppression of sugarcane farmers in the past, sugarcane farmers found sugarcane planting unprofitable. Many sugarcane farmers converted sugarcane fields to grow other crops, resulting in a reduction of sugarcane fields in the province to 570,000 mu in 1949.

After liberation, the Provincial People's Government vigorously supported sugarcane farmers in restoring production. Last year, the sugarcane planting area increased to 620,000 mu, but the output was still insufficient to meet the needs of public and private sugar factories. To increase sugarcane production and further support the recovery of the sugar industry, this spring the Provincial People's Government Industry Department Sugar Company successively allocated a huge loan of 55.1 billion yuan, focusing on the Pearl River area to lend to sugarcane farmers. At the same time, it was determined that the minimum ratio of sugar to rice this year would be one to five, which greatly improved the sugarcane farmers' enthusiasm for production. In addition, the Sugar Company also loaned out more than 18,000 tons of sugarcane seeds and 5.3 billion yuan for conversion expenses (expenses for converting other crops to sugarcane fields), enabling 80,000 mu of new sugarcane areas in the Pearl River and Chao汕 areas to be planted in a timely manner. Currently, sugarcane farmers in the province are carrying out weeding, fertilization, and soil cultivation work.

　　广东种甘蔗七十万余亩  配合制糖工业恢复生产
    广东全省今年播种甘蔗面积已超过七十万亩，比去年增加八万多亩，比一九四九年国民党反动派统治时增加了十三万亩。现在，蔗苗已出土一尺多高，长得非常茁壮。农民们对今年的甘蔗丰收满怀信心。广东省产蔗居我国大陆首位。种蔗最盛时期约达九十万亩。由于过去国民党反动统治对蔗农残酷地剥削压榨，因此，蔗农种蔗无利可图，许多蔗农把蔗田改种别种作物，致使一九四九年全省蔗田缩减为五十七万亩。
    解放后，该省人民政府大力扶助蔗农恢复生产，去年种蔗面积增至六十二万亩，但产量仍不足供应公私糖厂的需要。为增加甘蔗产量，以配合制糖工业进一步恢复生产，今春该省人民政府工业厅糖业公司先后拨出了五百五十一亿元的巨额贷款，以珠江区为重点贷给蔗农；同时确定今年砂糖和大米的最低比值为一比五，因而大大提高了蔗农的生产情绪。此外，糖业公司还贷出蔗种一万八千多吨和改耕费（由其他作物改为蔗田的费用）五十三亿元，使珠江区和潮汕区八万亩新蔗区得以及时下种。现在，该省蔗农正进行除草、施肥和培土工作。
