　　Closely Unite Around the Communist Party
    ——A Record of the 1948 Strike by Workers at Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory
       Xiao Wangruo
    Before liberation, under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Communist Party organization in Shanghai always persisted in heroic struggle. The Communist Party branch of the Shenxin Textile No. 9 Factory, which led the famous February 2nd Struggle, was one of countless branches.
    The February 2nd Struggle was a fight between humans and beasts! It thoroughly exposed the brutality and shamelessness of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and fully demonstrated the fearless heroic spirit of the Chinese Communist Party members and the masses of workers. On the 30th anniversary of our Party, it is very meaningful to review this living textbook.
  I. More Than Seven Thousand Workers United Around the Party Branch
    On January 30, 1948 (the day after the students of Tongji University fought with the armed police; the day before more than 10,000 Shanghai dancers protested the closure of their businesses and smashed the pseudo-Social Bureau), a general strike broke out at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory. More than 7,000 workers throughout the factory closely united around the Party branch to fight for reasonable treatment and demand that the factory distribute supplies like other factories. The factory representative said to the workers: "Do you want to be allocated coal? Wait until we open a coal mine, build a highway, and transport the coal to you. Do you want to be allocated rice? The villagers in the Wuxi area haven't even planted it yet!" The yellow trade union, controlled by special agents, said to the workers: "The factory is just like this, let's see what strength you have!"
    The workers then showed their strength.
    The Party branch organized a highly organized and disciplined strike force. Communist Party members told the workers in each workshop: "We must take good care of the workshops, protect the machines, and not let a single foreign thread be broken. We must let people know that the working class loves machines the most and is the most disciplined." The picket team was organized, with twelve pickets in each workshop guarding the machines to prevent special agents from taking the opportunity to sabotage. The propaganda team was also organized. The workers wrote and performed their own plays and sang "Unity is strength...." In the dark night of winter, everyone sat on the cold floor of the lane to rest. There was a pile of cotton next to them, but no one slept on it!
    The workers cared for the Communist Party members who led the strike very much. Everyone said they were too hard-working and worried that their health would not be able to take it, so they prepared better bedding for them; they were afraid they would be hungry, so they sent them baked cakes to eat; they were afraid they would be harmed, so they protected them at all times. When Communist Party member Qi Huaiqiong was giving a speech to the workers, she was knocked to the ground by special agents. The workers rescued her while saying: "This is not just hitting you, Comrade Qi Huaiqiong, this is hitting all of us workers!"
    In this atmosphere of mutual assistance, love, and close unity, the strike persisted for one day, two days, three days….

  II. The Fight Between Humans and Beasts
    Early in the morning of the fourth day—early in the morning of February 2nd, Xuan Tiewu, Yu Shuping, Lu Jingshi and other bandits mobilized more than 3,000 people, including cavalry, Flying Fortresses, police, security police teams, mobile brigades, and garrison troops, and surrounded the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, breaking through the first and second iron gates. American-made submachine guns, machine guns, tear gas bombs, and armored vehicles were all deployed. But the workers did not flinch at all, calmly carried out propaganda work to the pseudo-army, while carrying out combat preparations. They concentrated bricks, bowls, tables, benches, scrap iron, diesel barrels, etc. on the roof of the dining hall, and built fortifications at many entrances. They raised two flags on the third iron gate, with four large characters written on them: "Labor is Sacred"!
    Yu Shuping "broadcast" to the workers from an armored car:
    "The New Year is coming soon, please think carefully!"
    The workers replied: "We have already thought it over. We demand that the factory distribute supplies!"
    "You are not allowed to think anymore, go and start the machines! Otherwise, I will beat you to death one by one!"
    The workers began to sing: "Unity is strength..."
    Communist Party members Qi Huaiqiong, He Yuzhen, etc. immediately used megaphones to mobilize for combat:
    "Workers, we have no weapons today, only reason in our hands. Shenxin No. 9 is a factory, but Flying Fortresses have already been driven in front of us. If we yield, the oppression against us will be even more severe. They are determined to turn the factory into a battlefield, we must not be beaten to death in vain!"
    The workers roared: "Unity is strength, unity is strength!"
    The barbaric attack began.
    Under the personal command of Yu Shuping and others, with American armored vehicles as the vanguard, fully armed soldiers and police charged towards the bare-handed workers! The workers fought back heroically, using water hoses to spray the enemy, throwing bricks, tables, chairs, bowls, etc. from the roof, and the obstacles piled in front of the third iron gate forced the enemy's armored vehicles to retreat. Then, American submachine guns fired, covering the armored vehicles for another charge. Under the hail of bullets, the workers took cover behind the low walls and threw all kinds of weapons at the enemy. As soon as an armored vehicle crashed into the iron gate, it was hit by a diesel barrel thrown from the roof. Yan Zi, the chief inspector of the pseudo-garrison command, shouted and yelled, ordering the armored vehicle to continue charging! Communist Party member Zhou Xingmei suddenly snatched Yan Zi's pistol, and everyone rushed forward and captured him. This big special agent shouted like a dog: "Spare me! Spare me!"
    The third attack began. Another armored vehicle rushed up. The diesel barrels on the roof were all used up. It seemed that the armored vehicle was about to break through the iron gate. Female workers Guan Miaofu and others stood arm in arm in front of the armored vehicle, shouting: "Hmph, charge up, dare to charge up!" At this critical moment, Communist Party member Xu Quanfu drove a large truck out of the truck shop and desperately crashed into the enemy's armored vehicle, preventing it from entering the iron gate. The armored vehicle was damaged and had to stop. The enemy's rifles and machine guns fired at Xu Quanfu at the same time. Xu Quanfu fell sideways on the leather seat, his left hand gripping the steering wheel, and his right hand pulling the hand throttle, not allowing the engine to stop running, and always holding back the armored vehicle, covering the transfer of two or three thousand workers. The bullets shattered all the glass of the truck, damaged the engine, and injured Xu Quanfu's shoulder blade. However, the workers safely retreated to the fourth iron gate.
    At this time, Xuan Tiewu also arrived, ordered the use of gas bombs, and instructed Yu Shuping to adopt "regular combat methods." The bugle for the charge sounded, once, twice, three times! Yu Shuping, holding a bamboo whip, "encouraged" the massacre team to advance, beating and trampling many workers to death, and stabbing more workers.
    On the roof of the dining hall, Communist Party member He Yuzhen and others organized the workers to transfer while continuing to fight. She kept throwing large iron bars at the enemy. The enemy's machine guns kept sweeping the roof, and gas bombs were also released, a burst of fire, a burst of smoke. He Yuzhen was injured in the leg, and blood was flowing, but she did not feel any pain at all, and still threw iron blocks, iron bars... at the enemy.
    The battle lasted until 9 pm. The whole of Shanghai was seething. When the factory was first surrounded, representatives from all sides came to express their condolences to the workers, but they could not enter the factory, and the food they brought was snatched by the military police. After the battle, under the leadership of Tang Guifen, Fan Xiaofeng, and others, the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions organized a support association to publicize the truth of the February 2nd Incident to all sectors of society. The people of Shanghai stood on the side of the workers. Workers in various factories wore black armbands, posted slogans, raised donations, and prepared to hold a conference to mourn the martyrs. The atmosphere was very tense, and under the pressure of the masses, the reactionaries had to release 231 of the 269 people who had been arrested. The factory also had to issue each person fifty catties of allocated coal briquettes and two dou of allocated rice. However, this could not reduce the workers' biting hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Everyone had a common belief: one day they would avenge their grievances!

  III. This Day Finally Arrived
    This day finally arrived.
    The Communist Party members who led the struggle at that time all returned to the factory from prison and continued to lead the workers forward on the production front. The scabs who sabotaged the strike at that time, and the special agents who had been lurking in the factory since liberation, were all sanctioned by the people's government. Production has increased, workers' lives have improved, and the Party organization has developed. The song "The East is Red" resounded in every corner.
    "Unity is strength!" Chinese workers, united around the Communist Party, united under the banner of Mao Zedong, have endless strength! Comrade Yang Guangming, one of the leaders of the strike at that time and a Communist Party member who was sentenced to life imprisonment by the enemy, said to me: "At that time, we were transferred from one prison to another, and we found that in every prison, there were Communist Party members leading the struggle. As long as we thought of the Party and Chairman Mao, we felt full of strength, and we could withstand any torture and endure any hardship!" Then, in the new China after liberation, in the world of the people, what enemy cannot be defeated, and what difficulty cannot be overcome?

　　紧紧地团结在共产党的周围
    ——记一九四八年上海申新九厂工人的罢工斗争
       萧望若
    解放以前，在蒋介石匪帮的血腥统治下，上海的共产党组织始终坚持着英勇的战斗。领导有名的二·二斗争的申新纺织九厂共产党支部，便是无数支部中的一个。
    二·二斗争是人和兽的搏斗！它彻底暴露了蒋介石匪帮的残暴和无耻，充分表现了中国共产党员和工人群众的大无畏的英雄气概，因此，大大教育了全上海全中国的人民。在我们党的三十周年纪念日，把这部活的教科书温习一下，那是很有意义的。
  一、七千多工人团结在党支部的周围
    一九四八年一月三十日（同济大学的同学们跟武装警队搏斗的后一日；上海万余舞女抗议停业，捣毁伪社会局的前一日），申新九厂爆发了总罢工。全厂七千多工人紧紧地团结在党支部的周围，争取合理待遇，要求厂方像别厂一样地发配给品。厂方代表对工人说：“你们要配给煤吗？等我们开好煤矿，造好公路，把煤运来给你们。要配给米吗？无锡一带乡下人还没有种出来哩！”被特务把持的黄色工会对工友们说：“厂方就是这样了，看你们有什么力量！”
    工人们便拿出力量来了。
    党支部编组了有高度组织性和纪律性的罢工队伍。共产党员告诉各车间的工友们说：“我们要看好车间，保护机器，不要让一根洋线头断掉。我们要让人知道工人阶级顶爱机器，顶有纪律。”纠察队组织起来了，每个车间都有十二个纠察队员看守机器，防止特务乘机破坏。宣传队也组织起来了，工友们自己编剧，演剧，唱着“团结就是力量。……”在冬天的暗夜里，大家坐在车弄的冷地板上休息。旁边就是棉花堆，但谁也没有睡上去！
    工友们对领导罢工的共产党员是十分爱护的。大家说他们太辛苦了，怕他们身体吃不消，替他们准备较好的铺位；怕他们饿了，送烘饼给他们吃；怕他们遭到毒手，时时刻刻保护他们。共产党员戚怀琼对工友们讲话时，被特务打倒在地，工友们一边抢救，一边对她说：“这不是打你一个人呀，戚怀琼同志，这是打我们全体工人！”
    就在这样互助友爱、亲密团结的气氛中，罢工坚持了一天，两天，三天……。
  二、人与兽的搏斗
    第四天清晨——二月二日清晨，宣匪铁吾、俞匪叔平、陆匪京士等动员了马队、飞行堡垒、警察、保安警察队、机动大队、警备队等三千多人，把申新九厂团团围住，冲进了头道铁门和二道铁门。美国造的冲锋枪、机关枪、催泪毒气弹、装甲车，都摆出来了。但是工友们一点不畏缩，沉着地对伪军展开喊话工作，同时进行着战斗准备。他们在饭厅的屋顶上集中了砖头、饭碗、桌子、板凳、废铁、柴油桶等，在许多门口筑起了防御工事。他们在第三道铁门上撑起两面旗子，旗上写着四个大字：“劳工神圣”！
    俞匪叔平在装甲车上向工友们“广播”了：
    “快过年了，请你们仔细想一想！”
    工友们回答说：“我们早已想好了。我们要求厂方发配给品！”
    “不准你们再想，快去开车！否则我要把你们一个个打死！”
    工友们唱起歌来：“团结就是力量……”
    共产党员戚怀琼、何宇珍等立即用传话筒进行战斗动员：
    “工友们，我们今朝没有武器，只有道理在手里。申九是工厂，但飞行堡垒已经开到我们面前了。要是我们屈服了，对我们的压迫是会更加厉害的。他们决心要把工厂变成战场，我们决不能白白叫人打死！”
    工人们怒吼了：“团结就是力量，团结就是力量！”
    野蛮的进攻开始了。
    在俞匪叔平等亲自指挥下，以美国装甲车为先导，全副武装的军警向赤手空拳的工友们冲锋！工友们英勇反击，用水龙喷射敌人，从屋顶上向敌人丢下砖头、桌椅、碗盏……，堆在第三道铁门前的障碍物，迫使敌人的装甲车后退了。接着，美国冲锋枪响了，掩护装甲车再度冲锋。在纷飞的枪弹下，工友们掩蔽在短墙后边，向敌人抛掷各种各样的武器。装甲车刚刚撞进铁门，就被从屋顶上丢下来的柴油桶打伤了。伪警备司令部稽查大队长严滋大喊大叫，要装甲车继续冲锋！共产党员周杏妹猛然夺下严滋的手枪，众人一拥而上，把他捉住。这个大特务便像狗一样的喊着：“饶命！饶命！”
    第三次进攻开始了。另一辆装甲车冲上来。屋顶上的柴油桶丢完了。眼看装甲车就要冲进铁门了。女工管妙福等胳膊挽着胳膊，挺立在装甲车前面，喊道：“哼，冲上来吧，有胆量冲上来吧！”正在这种紧急关头，共产党员许泉福从卡车间开出了一辆大卡车，拚命向敌人的装甲车撞击，不准它开进铁门。装甲车被撞坏了，不得不停下来。敌人的步枪和机关枪一齐对许泉福射击。许泉福侧着身子倒在皮坐垫上，左手掌握着龙头盘，右手拉起手风门，不让马达停止跳动，一直顶住装甲车，掩护两三千工友转移阵地。枪弹打碎了卡车的全套玻璃，打坏了卡车的引擎，打伤了许泉福的肩胛。但是，工友们安全退到第四道铁门了。
    这时候，宣匪铁吾也赶来了，下令使用毒气弹，指示俞匪叔平采用“正规作战方法”。冲锋号响了，一次，两次，三次！俞匪叔平手拿竹鞭，“激励”屠杀队前进，打死、踏死了好些工友，刺伤了更多工友。
    在饭厅的屋顶上，共产党员何宇珍等一边组织工友们转移，一边坚持战斗。她不断向敌人丢掷大铁杠。敌人的机关枪不停地向这屋顶扫射，毒气弹也放出来了，一阵火，一阵烟。何宇珍腿上受伤了，鲜血直流，但她一点不觉得痛，仍然向敌人丢着铁块、铁杠………。
    战斗一直持续到下午九时。全上海沸腾了。工厂刚被包围的时候，各方的代表就纷纷前来慰问工友，可是无法进厂，带来的食品都给军警抢去了。搏斗结束后，在汤桂芬、范小凤等领导下，上海市各业工会组织了后援会，向各界宣传二·二事件的真相。全上海人民都站在工友的一边。各厂工人臂缠黑纱，贴标语，募捐，准备开大会追悼烈士。空气十分紧张，反动派在群众逼迫下，不得不把被捕的二百六十九人中的二百三十一人释放出来。厂方也不得不发给每人五十斤配给煤球和两斗配给米。然而这并不能减少工友们对蒋匪帮的刺骨仇恨，大家有一个共同的信念：总有一天要报仇雪恨！
  三、这一天终于到来了
    这一天终于到来了。
    当时领导斗争的共产党员们都从牢狱里回到厂里来了，在生产战线上，继续领导工友们前进。破坏当时罢工斗争的工贼，解放以来潜伏在厂内的特务，都受到了人民政府法律的制裁。生产提高了，工人的生活改善了，党的组织发展了。“东方红”的歌声响遍了每个角落。
    “团结就是力量！”中国工人团结在共产党的周围，团结在毛泽东的大旗下，就有无穷无尽的力量！当时罢工领导者之一、曾被敌人判处无期徒刑的共产党员杨光明同志对我说：“那时候，我们从一个牢狱被解到另一个牢狱，发现每一个牢狱里，都有共产党员在领导斗争。我们只要想起党、想起毛主席，就觉得混身是力量，什么毒刑都受得住，什么苦都吃得下！”那么在解放后的新中国，在人民的天下，还有什么不能战胜的敌人，还有什么不能克服的困难吗？
