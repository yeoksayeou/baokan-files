　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th: *Pravda*’s foreign affairs observer, Orekhov, commented on Dulles’ mission to London to prepare for a separate peace treaty with Japan, stating: On the day Dulles arrived in London, the *New York Times* correspondent in Washington wrote: Dulles' task is to "reconcile" the British proposals for a peace treaty with Japan with the American proposals. The protracted nature of these negotiations proves how deep and sharp the contradictions between the United States and Britain are on this issue.

　　However, these contradictions do not arise because either side sincerely wants a peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue. These contradictions arise from the conflicting interests of American and British imperialism in the Far East.

　　Both the United States and Britain oppose the procedures stipulated in previous international agreements. They both oppose convening a meeting of foreign ministers composed of representatives from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to prepare a peace treaty with Japan and inviting other countries that participated in the war against Japan to participate in this work. However, the American ruling clique believes that a separate peace treaty with Japan, coupled with a special US-Japan military agreement, is a means of further infringing upon the interests of its British partners and thereby establishing hegemony in the Pacific region. Britain's position has already been severely weakened, and this time Britain has been forced to yield on many issues. Britain has agreed that American troops will continue to be stationed in Japan after the signing of the treaty and has reluctantly agreed to transfer some Japanese islands to American administration.

　　The author pointed out that the difficulties encountered in Dulles' London talks are mainly related to the policy towards the People's Republic of China. The crux of the matter is that the United States wants Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the Chinese people, to represent China in drafting a separate peace treaty. However, as is well known, Britain has diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

　　The author also stated that facts have proven that although the British ruling clique has diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, they in fact continue to pursue a policy hostile to the Chinese people.

　　Now, with Dulles' talks in London, British newspapers have begun to talk about their expected "compromise," which will leave the issue of China's participation in the peace treaty with Japan "hanging in the balance," effectively preventing the People's Republic of China from participating in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan.

　　The author further pointed out that the British ruling clique is not concerned with adhering to international agreements and respecting the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. In the complex struggle with their American partners, the British ruling clique is unwilling to give up the "China card." They are still trying to bargain for more active American support on the issue of Iranian oil.

　　The author concluded that the collusion between American and British imperialism shows that Dulles' mission to London has nothing in common with preparing a genuine peace treaty with Japan, which must be drafted based on existing international agreements and in accordance with the interests of peace and security.

　　真理报评杜勒斯赴英        
    美英对日单独媾和谈判旷日持久
    证明两国在远东的利益冲突日深
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：真理报外交观察家奥列贺夫评论杜勒斯为准备单独对日和约而赴伦敦的使命称：在杜勒斯抵达伦敦的那一天，纽约时报驻华盛顿记者写道：杜勒斯的任务是把英国关于对日和约的主张与美国的主张“调和”起来。这次谈判的旷日持久，证明了美、英两国在这一问题上所存在的矛盾是多么深刻和尖锐。
    然而这些矛盾却不是因为其中有任何一方诚心要求和平解决日本问题而产生的。这些矛盾的产生是由于美、英帝国主义者在远东的利益互相冲突。
    美、英两国都反对历次国际协定所规定的程序，它们都反对召开由美国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国的代表组成的外长会议来准备对日和约，并邀请其他参加对日战争的国家参加这一工作。然而，美国统治集团认为，单独的对日和约再加上美日特别军事协定，乃是进一步侵害其英国伙伴的利益从而在太平洋地区建立霸权的手段。英国的地位本来已被严重地削弱，这一次英国又被迫在许多问题上屈服了。英国已经同意美国军队在和约签订后继续驻在日本，并勉强同意将日本的若干岛屿移交美国管理。
    作者指出：在杜勒斯的伦敦会谈中所发生的困难，主要地是与对中华人民共和国的政策有关。问题的症结是美国要中国人民的公敌蒋介石来代表中国参加拟订单独和约。但是，如所周知，英国是和中华人民共和国建立着外交关系的。
    作者又称：事实证明，虽然英国统治集团和中华人民共和国建立着外交关系，但是他们事实上继续奉行着敌视中国人民的政策。
    现在，随着杜勒斯到伦敦会谈，英国报纸已经开始大谈其预料中的“折衷办法”，这种“折衷办法”将使中国参加对日和约的问题“悬而不决”，实际上，就是不让中华人民共和国参加准备对日和约。
    作者进而指出：英国统治集团对于遵守国际协定和尊重中华人民共和国的合法权利，毫不关心。英国统治集团在和他们的美国伙伴进行的复杂斗争中，是不愿意放弃“中国王牌”的。他们还在力图用讨价还价的办法在伊朗石油问题上取得美国更积极的支持。
    作者结语称，美、英帝国主义之间的勾当说明，杜勒斯赴伦敦的使命和准备真正的对日和约毫无共同之处，真正的对日和约是必须根据现有的国际协定并且按照和平与安全的利益来草拟的。
