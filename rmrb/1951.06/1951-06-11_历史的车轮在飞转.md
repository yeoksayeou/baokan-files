　　The Wheels of History are Turning

　　　　"The Train Must Go to the Front"
　　November 8, 1950, is a day that will never be forgotten. That morning, the sky was clear, and the fresh frost of early winter fell on the banks of the Yalu River. In the early market of Andong, groups of schoolchildren walked by, carrying their schoolbags, jumping and chasing each other playfully. As the day had just begun, the Yalu River suddenly surged with waves more than ten feet high, the ground shook, and a towering fire erupted from Sinuiju across the river, overflowing and obscuring the clear sky of our motherland, turning joyous days into darkness.
　　This was another brutal bombing of Korea by the American beasts. The fire was burning Sinuiju and also burning at our national gate. Bombs fell one after another on our land, creating pain and tears. Who could bear to see the country, created from the blood of revolutionary martyrs over decades, harmed? No, no! Anyone with a bit of spirit could no longer endure it. The Volunteer Army surged across the river, and the peasant stretcher teams surged across the river... Our railway workers also braved the raging fire and crossed the Yalu River to the Korean battlefield at that time.
　　This battlefield does not distinguish between front and rear. At the front, the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army are pounding the enemy with fists as big as iron hammers, giving them black eyes and swollen noses. The people fighting in the rear include the Chinese and Korean railway workers fighting side by side.
　　But what a difficult battle this is! Bridges are broken, stations are overturned, bomb craters dot the landscape. The enemy wants to use planes to destroy everything on the ground into scorched earth, but what cannot be destroyed is the fighting spirit of the Korean people. We saw that many of the Korean railway workers were broken and lost their families, with only a set of tattered single clothes left. In the cold winter nights, braving the wind and cold, enduring hunger, they worked tirelessly to repair the railways. Hatred has forged the heroes of the Korean people.
　　Kim Hak-yong is one of them. When the American young masters had not yet tasted the flavor of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's fists and were retreating north, only dozens of miles away from Dingzhou, this Korean driver had to seriously consider this issue. There were three locomotives parked at the station, which were the property of their country and should be pulled away. But the workers had all evacuated, leaving him alone. And the locomotives were all extinguished. Enemy planes were always circling overhead, and the enemy might appear in front of him at any moment. The situation was very tight. He hardened his heart, put aside his personal life and death, and ran around alone, busy adding coal and water, and starting the fire. The wind rolled up dust, like the dust kicked up by enemy cars. He started one locomotive, hooked up the other two, and had just driven out of the station to the north when the enemy arrived at the station from the south.
　　For the liberation of their country, these brave Koreans forgot themselves and silently endured all the pain. If you ask about each person's family history, almost everyone has a tragic history in this war. There are no tears in their eyes, but a faint fire shines brightly.
　　But strangely, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came from the north that night, braving the wind and snow, and met them, these tough iron men could not help but shed tears. These were tears of joy. They also greeted the Chinese railway workers who volunteered to aid Korea with the same feelings.
　　Who can not respect and care for such class brothers? Cotton clothes, pork, banners, and various comfort items were sent from the hands of the Northeast railway workers, and from the hands of all the Chinese railway workers, to the hands of the Korean brothers.
　　The Korean brothers said gratefully: "How can we repay your kindness in helping us like this?"
　　You are wrong, comrade. Today's matter is not about you helping me or me helping you. We are participating in a common battle in a common life, fighting a common enemy. In order to ensure the victory of the front, they put forward a common fighting slogan.
　　"The train must go to the front! The train is a weapon! It's a cannonball!"
　　　　Playing "Guerrilla Warfare" with Airplanes
　　The enemies understand: as the train moves forward, weapons and ammunition are sent to the hands of the brave and skilled Chinese and Korean People's forces, and they are one step closer to death. If they want to extend their death sentence, they must stop the train from advancing. So, day and night, they chase locomotives, burn trains, blow up bridges, and destroy electric wires...full of menace.
　　But a signalman said: "You're fierce, I'll fight guerrilla warfare with you."
　　However, under the enemy's barbarous burning and killing, "guerrilla warfare" is not easy. Look at the two sides of the railway line, where is there a good house? Burned, bombed, or missing windows and doors, allowing the north wind to come and go back and forth. Our signalmen often carry supplies, carry tools, or drag a harrow in the snow, stumbling and trekking in the deserted wilderness. When hungry, they eat fried noodles. Without boiling water, they break ice and mix it with cold water. Not to mention not having a home, even if there are people, they firmly remember the instructions from their superiors not to touch a single blade of grass or tree of the Korean people. Who would be willing to eat a grain of rice from the long-suffering local people? There will be no proper sleeping place. Wherever they go, they fall asleep in cold houses full of frost and snow. Everyone presses back to back, legs intertwined, to get some warmth.
　　We often see that after each bombing, dozens of miles of electric wires are broken, and communication is impossible, which affects traffic. But in less than half a day, there is a ringing sound, and the telephone is clear again. This seems to be a miracle. It is precisely this group of Chinese and Korean signalmen who create miracles. They go where they repair, repair as they are bombed, and always circle around with the enemy planes.
　　The most moving thing is not just this.
　　Youth League member Wang Lianxiang has even more magical "guerrilla tactics". Once, the enemy dropped more than a hundred time bombs in one place, which exploded continuously, and the electric wires were blown to pieces, like many tangled threads. It might take a few days for all the time bombs to explode completely. But war does not allow waiting for a long time, and victory is won from time. Wang Lianxiang ran into the bomb nest at that time. The explosions were tight, with a bang, a bang, mud splashed on his face, and hot bomb fragments burned his clothes. He passed through the smoke and dust, bypassed the bombs, and ran back and forth to connect the wires. Just as this side was connected, that side was blown up again. At the critical moment, an enemy plane suddenly appeared in the sky again and fired a burst of bullets at him. This Chinese worker may have been shocked by the unexpected and could no longer control himself, running away to hide in the distance. Right near him, he found a large group of Volunteer Army soldiers lying there, their faces calm and firm. A picture immediately flashed in his mind, as if he saw this group of soldiers braving the enemy's fierce artillery fire, with this calm look, rushing forward with their guns. People are not afraid of charging, so what is he doing? His courage was drummed up, and without waiting for the enemy plane to fly away, he ran back and climbed onto the telephone pole, scrambling to repair the line. When the enemy plane came from the east, he turned to the west; when it came from the west, he turned to the east, always circling around with the enemy plane, working non-stop. But it was not good, the enemy plane must have seen him, and suddenly swooped up from the side, sweeping a burst of fire, and the people on the telephone pole were gone. Where are the people? In Wang Lianxiang's own words, he took the elevator. It turned out that he was holding the pole with both hands, sliding down quickly, and rolled aside to hide.
　　Wang Lianxiang is very young and looks ordinary, but when a person forgets himself and dedicates himself to the victory of the people, courage is attached to him. Courage is like a ray of light, making people great.
　　　　Li Changchun's Squad
　　Among the people, brave fighters are like stars in the summer night, shining everywhere with inextinguishable light.
　　Li Changchun's squad has a total of ninety-six people. After arriving in Korea from China, they crossed mountains and rivers and have been involved in difficult rescue and repair projects. Regardless of wind, snow, rain, or fog, they come in the water and roll in the mud. Everyone is covered in dust, and at first glance, it is difficult to recognize who is who. Why bother to distinguish them? They are united around squad leader Li Changchun, with one heart and one step, as if everyone's flesh and blood are kneaded together, re-kneaded into a giant who stands tall and treads the earth. This giant can split mountains with one palm and kick over rivers with one foot, and is opening up the road forward all the way.
　　They rushed to repair from the Yalu River to the Daling River: after experiencing many dangers, this day, they finally came to another vast white river. The river surface is wide, the water is deep and the current is rapid, and there is a half-completed bridge spanning the top. From the dense bullet holes on the bridgehead and the strong anti-aircraft artillery positions, it can be seen that there are frequent battles here. The enemy recognized this as a transportation artery and repeatedly bombed it, and our railway workers repeatedly repaired it. Now, Li Changchun's squad is a new force that has been put in to build the bridge in a short period of time and ensure traffic.
　　But on the second day after they arrived, at eight o'clock in the morning, Li Changchun led the entire team to the bridge just about to take over the work when an air raid came. As soon as four enemy planes approached the river bridge, they were surrounded by our anti-aircraft artillery shells, and countless white smoke burst open in front, behind, left, and right. The enemy planes were in a panic, and dropped bombs in confusion.
　　Li Changchun directed everyone to hide in the air-raid shelter along the river, and peered out, watching several bombs fall next to the bridge, and the water flowers soared as high as pillars, and then splashed out again. In the shadow of the water flowers, he saw that another team of workers on the bridge was still working hard, and they were blown apart by the bombs all at once. A worker covered in blood rolled off the bridge.
　　Li Changchun made a vicious decision. The planes were still humming overhead, circling around. He shook his fist at everyone and shouted: "Are we the working class led by Chairman Mao?"
　　Does it need to be asked? Not a bit ambiguous.
　　Li Changchun shouted again: "In front of our working class, is there anything that can scare us?"
　　Li Changchun further asked: "Death?"
　　Everyone shouted: "Being afraid of death means not being the working class!"
　　Li Changchun jumped out of the ditch: "That's right! Being afraid of death means not being the working class! The enemy blows up our bridge and kills our class brothers, what are we still doing here?" He waved his hand, and a small team of people followed him onto the bridge.
　　Two holes in the bridge were destroyed, and steel rails and sleepers were flying everywhere. On and under the bridge, there were some wounded comrades lying there, with broken hands and slanted legs, but each of them glared at the sky hatefully, enduring the pain, without humming a word. Li Changchun led the way with a stretcher to carry the wounded and found that three workers had already been sacrificed. Their faces were blown beyond recognition, but they were holding the bridge repair tools tightly in their hands. Workers treat tools like soldiers treat guns. Life can be abandoned, but weapons cannot be lost. These simple people love life and love freedom even more. For the freedom of the motherland and mankind, they abandon their beautiful lives, go to the Korean battlefield, and sprinkle their blood of loving freedom on foreign land. Let us always remember these unsung heroes!
　　All the workers of the squad silently loaded the bodies of their martyred comrades, without a single tear. Their tears have turned into revenge actions: immediately start repairing the bridge. It was February at that time, the river surface had melted a layer, and there was still ice underneath, which was cold to the bone. Not afraid of death, who is afraid of this? The people of Li Changchun's squad immediately took off their clothes and plunged into the water, first repairing the area that had just been bombed.
　　Have you seen soldiers charging? At that moment, every action is endowed with sacred meaning. Here, we saw another solemn charge. Under the spirit of this charge, the bridge was completed two days ahead of schedule, and the train passed through the bridge and drove to the front.
　　　　The Wheels of History are Turning
　　However, more intense battles are taking place on the train. Think about those restless nights, you often hear the train running fast, and the enemy planes humming overhead, this is the aerial robber trying to catch the train. Suddenly, the train screeches to a halt, there is no sound, and the enemy planes are left humming and turning blindly. Where is the train? Maybe it's hidden in a cave, or something else, anyway, it's flashed the enemy.
　　I also know a heroic story of a Korean driver. This person is called Han Nanshou, and he has won the First Class National Flag Medal and the Gold Star Medal. He is a hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. One night, he was pulling shells to the front and was attacked by an air raid halfway. The enemy plane rattled and swept for a while, and after passing over the sky, before it could turn around, Han Nanshou took advantage of the gap to drive away. The enemy plane turned around and swooped up again, and it was another burst of bullets, and the tail of the train caught fire. The enemy was happy: this time I'll let you run! So he turned around and fired at the firelight, turned around and fired again... After a lot of effort, a train of shells should have been blown clean. But it was strange, why did the fire get smaller and smaller? Why wouldn't it get smaller? Just the last car, as soon as it was hit, Han Nanshou had already dumped it, and who knows how far the front car had driven, maybe the shells had already been sent to the hands of the Chinese and Korean forces, and were aiming at the enemy to bombard them.
　　This is all wit, and they have even more courage. Now let me write with respect about the Korean national hero Choi Chi-jeong. This stationmaster was sacrificed in February of this year. As a Labor Party member, he could not stand by and watch the robbers bomb and burn the ten ammunition cars parked at the station. One car was burned to nothing, and it was about to spread to the second car. We must immediately try to separate those good cars by hand and push them out one by one. He mobilized workers and nearby farmers to do so. When pushing to the last good car, the fire was raging, and bullets were flying around like meteors. Who would dare to go up? Choi Chi-jeong ran towards the flames. He didn't want to die, but he engraved Premier Kim Il-sung's words in his heart one by one: "One bullet can kill an American soldier, and one bullet must be cherished!" In order to preserve this car of bullets, who would care about personal life and death. He went up, the flames surrounded him, and he seemed to be burning, turning into a torch. He was exactly a torch symbolizing victory and freedom. He separated the car, bullets flew, but he himself fell down.
　　With such thousands of Chinese and Korean railway employees, full of wisdom and courage, standing hand in hand on a battle line, what force can stop our trains from advancing victoriously? Night after night, in the wilderness of Korea, you can hear countless wheels rolling forward. This is the wheel of history. This wheel brings the enemy their destined death, and brings us the great victories created by the Chinese and Korean People's forces in Unsan, Chongchon River, Imjin River, Han River... again and again.
　　The wheels of history are turning, and the mantis's arms cannot stop it.

　　历史的车轮在飞转
　　杨朔
            “列车要往前线开”
    一九五○年十一月八日，这是个永远难忘的日子。那天早晨，高空晴朗朗的，初冬的新鲜霜花落在鸭绿江边，安东的早市上走着一群一群上学的小孩，提着书包，跳着脚，嘻嘻地互相追逐着。一天刚开始了，鸭绿江忽然掀起一丈多高的浪头，地面震动着，隔岸新义州冒起冲天的烟火，漫过江来，遮蔽住我们的祖国晴朗天空，欢乐的日子一时变得暗无天日了。
    这是美国野兽对朝鲜的又一次的残酷的轰炸。大火正烧着新义州，也烧到我们的国门，炸弹接二连三落到我们的国土上，制造出痛苦和眼泪。谁能眼看着自己几十年从革命先烈的血泊里创造出来的国家受到危害？不行，不行！凡是有点血性的人再也忍不住了。志愿军涌过江去，农民担架队涌过江去……我们的铁路工人也就在当时冒着漫天大火渡过了鸭绿江，挺身到朝鲜战场上。
    这个战场不大分前方后方。前有朝鲜人民军和我们的志愿军举着铁锤般大小的拳头捶得敌人鼻青眼肿，战斗在后方的人们中就有着并肩作战的中朝铁路工人。
    但这是怎样艰苦的战斗啊！桥梁断了，车站翻了，炸弹坑罗着坑，敌人是要用飞机把地面上所有的东西都毁灭成焦土，但毁灭不了的却是朝鲜人民的斗志。我们看见那些朝鲜铁路工人中许多人家破人亡，浑身只剩一套破烂的单衣，隆冬深夜，冒着风寒，忍着饥饿，通宿通夜地赶修着铁路。仇恨锻炼出朝鲜人民的英雄。
    金学龙就是其中一个。当美国少爷兵还没领教过中国人民志愿军拳头的滋味，节节北窜，离定州只有几十里地时，这个朝鲜司机不能不严重地考虑这个问题了。站上停着三台机车，这是他们国家的财产，应该拉走。但是工友们都撤退了，只剩他孤零零的一个人。而机车又都落了火。头上的敌机总在打旋，敌人说不定几时就会出现在他面前。情形是很紧了。他把心一横，丢开个人的生死，一个人跑来跑去，忙着上煤上水，动手生火。风卷尘头，也象是敌人汽车碾起飞尘。他把一台机车生起火，挂上其余那两台，刚从北面开出站，敌人也就从南头赶到站了。
    为了他们祖国的解放，这些勇敢的朝鲜人忘掉自己，沉默地忍受着一切痛苦。你去问问每人的家世，几乎在这次战事里都有一段惨痛的历史，他们眼里可没有泪，闪闪发亮的是一种隐隐的烈火。
    可是奇怪，当那一夜，中国人民志愿军从北地赶来，冲风冒雪，跟他们一会面时，这些铁打的硬汉子忍不住掉下泪了。这是欢喜的眼泪。他们也用同样的心情迎接了志愿援朝的中国铁路工人。
    对这样的阶级兄弟，谁能不敬爱？谁能不关怀？棉衣、猪肉、锦旗、各色各样的慰劳品，从东北铁路工人手里送来，从全中国铁路工人手里送来。送到朝鲜兄弟的手里。
    朝鲜兄弟感激地说：“你们这样帮助我们，怎样才能报答你们的恩情呢？”
    错了，同志。今天的事，不是你帮我，也不是我帮你。我们是在共同的生活上参加共同的战斗，打击一个共同的敌人。为了保证前线的胜利，他们提出共同的战斗口号。
    “列车要往前线开！火车就是武器！就是炮弹！”
            跟飞机打“游击”
    敌人们明白：火车前进一步，武器弹药送到英勇善战的中朝人民部队手里，他们也就更接近死亡一步。他们想延长自己的死亡期限，就要阻止列车前进。于是无日无夜，追机车，烧火车，炸桥梁，毁电线………气势汹汹。
    一个通信工却说：“你凶，我跟你打游击。”
    不过在敌人野蛮的烧杀下，“打游击”并不容易。请看铁路沿线的两旁，那有间好房子？烧的烧，炸的炸，要不也是缺窗缺门，由着大北风出来进去来回串。我们的通信工时常背着给养，扛着家伙，再不就在雪地上拖着个耙犁，颠颠扑扑跋涉在荒无人烟的野地里。饿了，吃炒面，没有开水，敲碎冰凌使冷水拌。别说没有人家，就是有人，他们牢记着上级所说的不动朝鲜人民一草一木的指示，谁又肯吃久受摧残的当地人民一粒米呢？睡更不会有什么正经睡处。走到那儿，倒头困在挂满霜雪的冷屋子里，大家背贴着背，腿插着腿，取点暖和。
    我们常看见每次轰炸后，电线一断几十里，不能通话，影响行车，可是不上半天，丁零丁零一阵铃响，电话又畅通了。这好像是个奇迹。创造奇迹的正是那一群一伙的中朝通信工。他们走到那修到那，随炸随修，老是跟敌机兜圈子。
    最动人的还不在此。
    青年团员王连祥更有着神奇的“游击战术”。有一回，敌人在一处丢下一百多颗定时炸弹，接连不断地响，把电线炸的稀烂，好像许多团乱丝。要等定时弹完全炸光，说不定得几天。战争可不允许久等，胜利是从时间里争得的。王连祥当时跑进炸弹窝去。爆炸正紧，轰的一下，轰的一下，泥土崩到他的脸上，烫热的炸弹片子烧糊他的衣裳。他穿过烟尘，绕开炸弹，来回跑着接线。这面刚接好，那面又炸毁了。正在吃紧的当儿，敌机忽然又出现在上空，冲着他就是一梭子弹。这个中国工人也许受到意外的震惊，再也掌不住自己，跑到远处躲起来了。就在他的近旁，他发现一大群志愿军的战士卧在那儿，脸色沉静而刚毅。他的脑子立时幻出一幅画面，仿佛看见这群战士冒着敌人激烈的炮火，带着这种沉静的脸色，挺着枪冲向前去。人家冲锋都不怕，自己这算干什么呢？他的勇气鼓起来了，也不等敌机飞走，又跑回去爬上电线杆子，抢着修线。敌机从东来了，他一转转到西面；从西来了，他又转到东面，老跟敌机打转转，不停手地做活。可是不好，敌机准是看见他了，突然从侧面扑上来，哗哗一阵扫射，电杆子上不见人了。人呢？用王连祥自己的话来说，坐着电梯走了。原来他两手抱着杆子，趋溜地滑下来，早滚到旁边隐藏好。
    王连祥他人很年轻，样子也平常，但当一个人忘掉自己献身给人民的胜利，勇敢就附到他的身上。勇敢像一道灵光似的，使人变得伟大。
            李长春小队
    在人民中间，勇敢的斗士好象夏夜的繁星，到处闪射着不灭的光芒。
    李长春小队共总九十六个人，从中国开到朝鲜后翻山过水，一直投在艰苦的抢修工程里。不管是风雪雨雾，他们水里来，泥里滚，一个个满脸风尘，乍眼一看，认不清谁是谁了。又何必强分别他们呢？他们团结在小队长李长春的周围，一个心眼，一个脚步，好象大家的血肉也捏到一块，重新捏成个顶天立地的巨人。这巨人一掌可以劈开山，一脚可以踢翻河，一路都在开辟着前进的道路。
    他们从鸭绿江抢修到大宁江：经历过多次艰险，这天，终于来到另一条白茫茫的大江前。江面很宽，水深流急，上头横跨着一座半完成的桥。从桥头密密弹窝上，从强固的高射炮阵地上，可以看出这里经常有着战斗。敌人认准这是条交通要道，反复轰炸，我们的铁路工人就反复抢修。现在，李长春小队正是一支新投进来的生力军，要在短期内把桥修成，保证通车。
    但在他们赶到的第二天，清晨八点，李长春领着全队人上桥刚要接手做工，空袭来了。四架敌机一接近江桥，当时被我们的高射炮弹包围住，前后左右爆裂开无数股白烟。敌机乱了群，忽隆忽隆混丢炸弹。
    李长春指挥大家躲在沿江的防空壕里，自己探着头望，眼瞅着桥旁落下几颗炸弹，水花跟柱子似的一窜多高，唰地又喷溅开来。水花影里，只见桥上有另外一队工友正在坚持工作，一下子叫炸弹炸散了，有个工友浑身是血滚下桥去。
    李长春发了个狠。头上的飞机还嗡嗡着，打着盘旋，他对大家摇着拳头叫道：“我们是不是毛主席领导的工人阶级？”
    这还用问？一点不含糊。
    李长春又叫道：“在咱们工人阶级面前、还有东西能吓倒咱么？”
    李长春进一步问道：“死呢？”
    大伙轰地嚷道：“怕死还叫工人阶级！”
    李长春跳出沟道：“对！怕死就不叫工人阶级！敌人炸坏我们的桥，炸死我们的阶级兄弟，我们还楞着干啥？”他把手一招，一小队人跟着他冲上桥去。
    桥毁了两孔，钢轨枕木飞的到处都是。桥上桥下，躺着些受伤的同志，手断了，腿斜了，可是一个个恨恨地瞪着天空，忍着痛，谁也不哼一声。李长春领着头用担架抬救伤员，发现有三个工友已经牺牲了。他们炸的脸都认不出原样，手里可紧紧地握着修桥的工具。工人看待工具，就像战士看待枪，命可以不要，武器是不能丢的。这些朴实的人爱生活，更爱自由，为了祖国和人类的自由，他们丢开美好的生活，走上朝鲜战场，用自己爱自由的热血洒到异国的土地上。让我们永远记住这些无名英雄吧！
    全小队的工友默默地装殓起自己死难的同志，没有一滴泪。他们的眼泪都化成复仇的行动：马上动手抢修桥梁。当时正是二月，江面化了一层，下面还结着冰，冷的透骨。死都不怕，谁怕这个呢？李长春小队的人立时脱了衣裳，扑腾扑腾跳进水去，首先抢修刚刚被炸的地方。
    你见过战士冲锋么？在那一霎，每个动作都赋有神圣的意义。这里，我们看见了另一种庄严的冲锋。在这种冲锋的精神下，桥提前两天完成，列车通过桥去，开上前线。
            历史的车轮在飞转
    但是，更激烈的战斗正在行车上。想想那些不平静的夜晚啊，你时常会听见火车咯蹬咯蹬紧跑，上空的敌机呜呜紧响，这是空中强盗要捕火车了。忽然之间，火车咯蹬地煞住，没有声了，光撇下敌机呜呜瞎转。火车呢？也许藏进山洞，也许怎的，反正把敌人闪了个空。
    我还知道个朝鲜司机的英勇故事。这人叫韩南寿，得过一级国旗勋章和金星章，是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的英雄。一晚上，他拉着炮弹往前线送，半路遭到空袭。敌机咯咯扫射一阵，掠过上空，没等回过头来，韩南寿插空子开着车飞跑。敌机转了个圈，又扑上来，又是一梭子弹，火车的尾部起火了，敌人得了意：这回再叫你跑！于是转一圈，朝着火光打一阵，转一圈，再打一阵………搞了好大工夫，一列车炮弹该炸干净了。可是怪呀，怎么火光倒越来越小？怎么会不小？就尾部那么一辆车，一打着时，早叫韩南寿甩掉，前面的车谁知道开出多远，说不定炮弹已经送到中朝部队的手里，正对准敌人轰击呢。
    这都是机智，他们更有的是勇气。现在让我带着敬意写到朝鲜的民族英雄崔治政。这个站长在今年二月间牺牲了。做为一个劳动党员，他不能眼睁睁地让强盗把站上停的十辆弹药车投弹烧光。一辆烧的不剩啥了，眼看着蔓延到第二辆。必须立时设法用手分开那些好车，一辆一辆推出去。他动员工人和附近农民这样做了。推到最末一节好车时，火势正猛，子弹像流星似的四外乱崩。谁敢上去呢？崔治政冲着火焰跑上去。他不想死，但他心里一笔一笔刻着金日成首相的几句话：“一发子弹能打死一个美军，一发子弹也要爱惜！”为了保全这车子弹，个人的生死谁去计较。他上去了，火焰包围住他，他整个人好象也烧起来，变成枝熊熊的火把。他正是枝象征着胜利和自由的火把，他分开车，子弹飞来，他自己却倒下去了。
    有这样成千成万的中朝铁路员工，充满智慧与勇敢，手拉着手站在一条战线上，什么力量能够阻止我们的列车胜利前进？夜夜，在朝鲜的原野上，你可以听见无数车轮滚滚而进。这是历史的车轮。这车轮带给敌人的是命定的死亡，带给我们的却是中朝人民部队在云山、清川江、临津江、汉江……一次又一次所创造的伟大的胜利。
    历史的车轮在飞转，螳螂的胳臂是挡不住的。
