　　Supporting the Ministry of Personnel's Abolition of the Regulation Against Employing Pregnant Women
  (I) Comrade Editor:
    The Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government's decision to abolish the regulation of "not employing pregnant women" when recruiting staff and students is very correct. I fully support this regulation. During the revolutionary war, and especially after the founding of New China, many women participated in work and played a significant role in the country's economic, political, cultural and other construction undertakings. However, some organs and schools have insufficient understanding of enhancing women's rights and still stipulate "not employing pregnant women" when recruiting staff and students. Therefore, pregnant women lose the opportunity to participate in work or study, which makes many married women pessimistic and disappointed, and some pregnant women even resort to abortion.
    This regulation of the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government not only solves the problem of pregnant women participating in work and study, but also plays a significant role in protecting the new generation of New China.

  (II)
    After reading the "Notice on Abolishing the Regulation of 'Not Employing Pregnant Women' When Recruiting Staff and Students" issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government in the People's Daily on June 10th, I deeply felt that the People's Government is always concerned about the welfare of women, so that women in New China have equal rights with men in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and education.
    In the old society, women were regarded as appendages of men. They spent their days in the kitchen, consuming their lives in housework. Women had no status in society at all. It was difficult for them to find a job based on their own abilities, let alone pregnant women.
    With the victory of the Chinese revolution, we women have also turned over. And now, even pregnant women can serve the people in suitable positions!
    We must not forget the care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for us. We must make excellent achievements in our actual work and strive to build a new China.

### 拥护人事部废除招考工作人员不收孕妇的规定

　　拥护人事部废除招考工作人员不收孕妇的规定
  （一）编辑同志：
    中央人民政府人事部关于废除招考工作人员和学员时“不收孕妇”的规定，是非常正确的。我完全拥护这个规定。在革命战争中，特别是新中国成立后，很多妇女参加了工作，对祖国的经济、政治、文化等各种建设事业起了很大作用。但是有些机关、学校，对提高妇女权利认识不足，在招考工作人员和学员时，还规定“不收孕妇”。因此怀了孕的妇女就失掉了参加工作或学习的机会，这使很多已婚妇女悲观失望，有的孕妇因而堕胎。
    中央人民政府人事部这个规定，不但解决了怀孕妇女参加工作及学习的问题，同时对保护新中国新生的一代，也起了很大作用。

  （二）
    看到六月十日人民日报所刊中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”后，我深深感到人民政府无时无刻不在关怀着妇女的福利，使新中国妇女在政治、经济、文化教育等各方面，都有了与男子平等的权利。
    在旧社会里，妇女被视为男子的附属品。她们整天守着厨房，把自己的一生消磨在家务中。妇女在社会上根本是没有地位的，她们想凭自己的能力找职业，那是一件难事，孕妇更不必谈了。
    随着中国革命的胜利，我们妇女也翻了身。而现在，就是孕妇也可以在适合自己的工作岗位上为人民服务了！
    我们不能忘记共产党和毛主席对我们的关怀。我们要在实际工作中作出优良的成绩，为建设新中国而奋斗。
