Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - According to TASS, Berlin: On June 3rd, in the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Sector of Berlin, a people's referendum began on opposing German remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. From early morning, people flocked to the polling stations like a tide. Although the voting was to continue for three days, the majority of residents had already voted on the first day.

As of 5 p.m. on June 3rd, residents in 1,279 sub-districts and towns in the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Sector of Berlin had voted.

Among citizens eligible to vote in the major cities of the Republic, as of 5 p.m. on June 3rd, the percentage who had participated in the vote was: Wismar 88.4 percent, Zwickau 85.1 percent, Dessau 83.6 percent, Brandenburg 83.2 percent, Rostock 77.1 percent, Leipzig 77 percent, Potsdam 73 percent, and Jena 66.8 percent.

In rural areas, citizens were also enthusiastically participating in the voting. In six villages in the Sententhurnburg area of Brandenburg, all eligible residents had voted by 8:30 a.m. on June 3rd.

In the Democratic Sector of Berlin, in two polling districts in the Pankow district, 99.2 percent and 92 percent of eligible residents had participated in the voting as of 5 p.m. on June 3rd. In the Köpenick and Prenzlauer Berg districts, more than 50 percent of eligible residents had voted before noon on June 3rd.

Working people from West Germany sent many delegations to various parts of the Republic to observe the voting. Laubeul, who came to Dresden, said: "Here, one can see the true democratic order of voting; people are participating in the voting not only with ballots but also with sincere hearts." Seventeen workers from Hamburg, Hanover, and Schleswig-Holstein in West Germany visited some areas of Mecklenburg in the German Democratic Republic and discussed with the working people of the Republic at the polling stations how to act in unity in the struggle for peace.

To welcome the people's referendum, the working people in various parts of the Republic launched large-scale labor competitions. Workers put forward guarantees to increase extra production and save raw materials and energy. Farmers put forward the slogan of paying agricultural products to the state as soon as possible and guaranteed to send more meat, milk, and butter to the cities. Government officials also put forward work guarantees.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - According to TASS, Berlin: The people of West Germany and West Berlin, under the terrorist persecution of the Bonn "government" and the West Berlin authorities, are still persisting in holding a people's referendum against remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

The West Berlin authorities recently illegally arrested Walter Schmidt, the first chairman of the West Berlin People's Referendum Central Committee, member Garhart Tibiokovsky, and many organizers of the people's referendum. West German police took various terrorist measures, confiscating ballots, tearing down slogans and posters calling for the people's referendum, and dispersing various gatherings, attempting to obstruct the holding of the people's referendum. However, the people's referendum movement is still constantly unfolding in various residential areas of West Berlin. According to the German News Agency, there are more than two hundred people's referendum committees active in West Berlin. 86.3 percent of those who participated in the vote cast affirmative votes. The working people in the American-occupied districts of Steglitz and Lichterfelde, with very few exceptions, opposed remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

Throughout West Germany, the people's referendum movement is still constantly developing in various factories, shops, and residential areas. All eight hundred employees of a company in Stuttgart voted against remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty in 1951. In the Altona district of Hamburg, out of 1,812 residents consulted, 1,810 opposed remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty in 1951.

    德意志民主共和国开始举行人民投票
    西德投票运动在波恩“政府”恐怖迫害下仍坚持进行
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：六月三日，在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区开始举行关于反对德国重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结对德和约的人民投票。从清早起，人民就像潮水一样地不断地涌到投票站。虽然投票要继续三天，但是，大多数居民都已在第一天投了票。
    截至三日下午五时止，在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区，已经有一千二百七十九个分政区和市镇的居民投了票。
    在共和国各大城市中有投票资格的公民中，截至三日下午五时止，参加了投票的，维斯马占百分之八十八点四，兹维考占百分之八十五点一，德骚占百分之八十三点六，布兰登堡占百分之八十三点二，罗斯多克占百分之七十七点一，来比锡占百分之七十七，波茨坦占百分之七十三，哲那占百分之六十六点八。
    在农村中，公民们也是同样地踊跃参加投票。在布兰登堡州的森天腾堡地区的六个乡村中，有投票资格的全体居民在三日上午八时半以前就全部投了票。
    在柏林民主区，潘考区的两个投票区中，有投票资格的居民截至三日下午五时止，参加投票的，达到百分之九十九点二和百分之九十二。在哥本尼克区和普伦茨劳尔区，百分之五十以上有投票资格的居民，都在三日中午以前就投了票。
    西德劳动人民派遣了许多代表团到共和国各地来参观投票。来到德累斯顿的劳伯尔说：“在这里，可以看到投票的真正民主秩序，人民不仅是带着票纸，而且是怀着真诚的心来参加投票的。”从西德的汉堡、汉诺威和石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州等地来的十七名工人访问了德意志民主共和国梅格林堡州的某些地区，并且就在投票站上和共和国的劳动人民讨论了如何在争取和平的斗争中一致行动的问题。
    为了迎接人民投票，共和国各地劳动人民都展开了大规模的劳动竞赛。工人们提出了增加额外生产、节省原料和动力的保证。农民们就提出尽快地向国家缴纳农产品的口号，并保证多送肉类、牛奶和牛油进城。政府机关职员们也提出了工作保证。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德和西柏林的人民在波恩“政府”和西柏林当局的恐怖迫害之下，仍然坚持举行反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票。
    西柏林当局最近曾非法逮捕了西柏林人民投票中央委员会第一主席瓦特·施米特、委员加尔哈特·提比奥科夫斯基以及许多人民投票的组织者。西德警察采取了种种恐怖手段，没收票纸，撕毁关于号召举行人民投票的标语和招贴画，驱散各种集会，企图阻挠举行人民投票。但是，人民投票运动仍在柏林西部各居民区中不断地展开。据德意志通讯社报道，在西柏林，共有二百多个人民投票委员会在进行活动。参加投票的人有百分之八十六点三投同意票。美占区斯托葛利兹与立克得菲特两区内的劳动人民，除了极少数以外，都反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结对德和约。
    在西德各地，人民投票运动仍在各工厂、商店与住宅区内，不断发展。斯图加特一个企业的职工八百人，全体投票反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结和约。在汉堡的阿尔托那区，一千八百一十二个被征询的居民中，一千八百一十人都反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结和约。
