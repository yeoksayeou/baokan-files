　　Advancing Towards the Goal of One Million Kilometers Without Accidents - Resolutely Implementing the Covenant to Complete Transportation Tasks
    ——Letter from Zhang Qinglin and Shi Jihu of the Guisui Train Depot

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership, our working class is forever advancing on the road to a bright future. Now the thirtieth anniversary of our working class's political party is approaching. Our train conductor team is specially reporting to you on our work over the past year. Since the launch of the new production record creation movement in Red May last year, all comrades of the Guisui Train Depot's train conductors have unanimously proposed to strive for 500,000 kilometers of safe travel without accidents. However, due to the negligence of individual comrades in our group, insufficient political and ideological study, and internal disunity, accidents seized the opportunity during the movement, resulting in four responsible accidents, failing to complete the task smoothly. After accepting this painful lesson, we immediately established regular political study, correctly used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, made every comrade aware of the seriousness of accidents, and established an overall concept and various systems such as joint labor, making our production enemies (accidents) unable to find any openings. Over the past year, under the party's cultivation and education, the political and professional levels of the comrades have improved significantly. From September 14, 1950, to May 29 of this year, we finally completed 500,000 kilometers of safe travel without accidents. At the same time, the movement also cultivated seven deputy station master cadres, fourteen train conductors, and transformed five backward elements.

This year, in order to welcome the Party's birthday, after discussion by the whole group, we decided to make persistent efforts on the existing basis to move towards the goal of no accidents throughout the year and one million kilometers without accidents. Furthermore, we have re-increased several conditions to enrich the group production covenant, which we previously challenged the Ma Hengchang team, and we are neither arrogant nor impetuous. We have the confidence and determination to complete the 1951 transportation tasks.

Currently, in order to respond to the three calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, all members of our group have decided to donate all of our excess bonuses and rationalization proposal bonuses, under the principle of active production, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in purchasing airplanes and artillery. At present, all group members are beginning to examine the implementation of the patriotic covenant, have appropriately revised it, and have launched the red flag competition among workshops and groups and the patriotic production movement. We assure you: we will strictly abide by various systems, overcome all shortcomings, and consolidate the results of safe travel to strengthen the country's economic construction and national defense construction, and strive to complete the transportation tasks to the end!

        Respectfully wishing you eternal good health
        Zhang Qinglin Shi Jihu
        Guisui Train Depot, Tianjin Railway Bureau

　　向百万公里无事故目标前进  坚决执行公约完成运输任务
    ——归绥车务段张庆麟石吉虎的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在您英明的领导下，我们工人阶级永远往光明大道上迈进。现在我们工人阶级的政党三十周年的生日就要来到了。我们运转车长小组特向您报告一年来工作的情况。自从去年红五月开展创造生产新纪录运动以来，我们归绥车务段运转车长全体同志们一致提出为安全走行五十万公里无事故而奋斗。但是，由于我们组内个别同志的麻痹大意，以及政治思想上学习的不够和内部不团结，以致运动的过程里使事故钻了空儿，发生了四次责任事故，没有顺利完成任务。我们接受了这惨痛教训后，马上建立了正规化的政治学习，正确运用了批评与自我批评的武器，使每个同志重视了事故的严重性，并且树立了整体观念，建立了联合劳动以及其他各种制度，使我们的生产上的敌人（事故）无隙可乘。一年来，在党的培养与教育下，同志们的政治与业务水平都有了显著提高。自一九五零年九月十四日至今年五月二十九日，终于完成了五十万公里安全走行无事故。同时，在运动中还培养了副站长干部七人，运转车长十四人，改造了落后分子五人。
    今年，我们为了迎接党的生日，经全组讨论，决定在现有基础上再接再厉，要向全年无事故、百万公里无事故的目标迈进。并且我们已经把过去向马恒昌小组应战的条件又重新增加了好几条，充实了小组生产公约，不骄不躁，有信心有决心来完成一九五一年的运输任务。
    目前，我们全组组员为了响应抗美援朝总会的三项号召，决定在积极生产原则下把每人的超额奖金及合理化建议奖金全部捐献，支援中国人民志愿军购买飞机大炮。目前，全体组员正开始检查爱国公约执行情形，并已适当地修改，开展了各车间小组红旗竞赛及爱国主义生产运动。我们向您保证：严守各种制度，克服一切缺点，巩固安全走行成绩为加强祖国经济建设与国防建设，为完成运输任务而奋斗到底！
        敬祝身体永远健康
        天津铁路局归绥车务段  张庆麟  石吉虎
