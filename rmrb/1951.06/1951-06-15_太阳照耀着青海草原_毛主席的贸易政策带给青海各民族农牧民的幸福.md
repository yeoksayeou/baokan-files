　　The Sun Shines on the Qinghai Grassland
　　--Chairman Mao's Trade Policy Brings Happiness to Farmers and Herdsmen of All Nationalities in Qinghai
　　Xue Hongfu, Director of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce

　　Since the liberation of Qinghai, the People's Government has correctly implemented ethnic and trade policies, which has improved people's lives and production morale. The young men and women herding sheep are all wearing new red or blue twill clothing, happily herding sheep and singing songs. Herdsmen are studying in many ways how to fatten their sheep and produce more wool. Qiuerji, a Tibetan from Guide County, said: "Ma Bufang stripped us of our clothes, but Chairman Mao clothed us. Chairman Mao is the sun, warming us." Various colored twills, hats, and white flour are now popular in nomadic areas. When Mongol and Tibetan people meet cadres of the People's Government, they always give a thumbs up to express their gratitude. Many people who go to Huangyuan and Xining always take a portrait of Chairman Mao home with them. Tibetan women in Xinghai County, wearing new cotton robes (instead of dancing costumes) during the New Year, danced and sang loudly: "The Communist Party is our father, the People's Liberation Army is our mother, and the staff are our brothers and sisters. They saved us, we are happy, and our cattle and sheep are fat and strong."

　　　　The Encounters of the Past Thirty Years

　　Qinghai is inhabited by seven nationalities, including Hui, Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh. It has vast natural grasslands, boundless salt flats, and is rich in world-renowned wool and rhubarb, as well as gold buried underground. However, before liberation, under the dark rule of the Ma Bufang bandit gang for decades, cities were dilapidated, commerce was depressed, and large numbers of farmers and herdsmen went bankrupt or became extremely poor. Many kind people were forced by livelihood to either flee or revolt. In the Huangyuan area, there were many tragic cases of selling children.

　　In order to systematically plunder the property of people of all nationalities, the Ma Bufang bandit gang established "Dexinghai" stores (called "Hundred Surnames Harm" by the common people) in various counties throughout the province. They forcibly bought Qinghai's produced furs, rhubarb, etc. at extremely low prices, and sold large quantities of tea and cloth to herdsmen at extremely high prices. Herdsmen could only exchange 100 catties of wool for one and a half bricks of Fu tea (6 catties per brick), 2 zhang of wide fine cloth, and 2 shi of wheat. The Tibetans in the Guoluo area refused to submit and suffered years of armed massacres by the Ma Bufang bandits, severing economic relations with the outside world for thirty years. Their wool, ghee, and cowhide were sealed off locally and became waste products. They had to dig grass roots, slaughter livestock, drink cow blood, and wear sheepskin all year round. As a result, the number of sheep in Qinghai decreased rapidly during the Ma Bufang's rule. Tongren County used to have 800,000 sheep, but when it was liberated, there were less than 200,000. Herdsmen never saw white flour all year round. It was even more common for them not to have cotton clothes to wear in winter. The extremely low purchasing power of the people, coupled with Ma Bufang's monopoly of the market, meant that Qinghai's industry was out of the question. The only eight factories in Xining producing leather, matches, and soap were not as good as workshops in big cities. Commerce was the same: Huangyuan County was a wool distribution center in Qinghai in 1929, with many shops. After 1930, it was manipulated and squeezed out by Ma Bufang's "Dexinghai", foreign businessmen left, and local shops closed down one after another.

　　　　After Liberation

　　On September 5, 1949, Qinghai was liberated. This was the beginning of great unity and improved living conditions for all nationalities. The People's Government first paid attention to purchasing agricultural and pastoral products at fair prices.

　　In 1950, the state-owned trading company in Qinghai purchased more than 8.24 million catties of wool, more than 73,000 sausage casings, more than 54,000 shi of grain, and 16 kinds of local products such as rhubarb. In the large-scale purchase of local and special products, more than 85.6 billion yuan of RMB was put in, equivalent to more than 285,000 bolts of 40-yard wide cloth (300,000 yuan per bolt), more than 1.427 million bricks of tea (6 catties per brick, priced at 60,000 yuan), and more than 85.66 million catties of flour (1,000 yuan per catty).

　　The trading company paid special attention to supplying the people of all nationalities with daily necessities. During the above period, it supplied cloth, native cloth, tea, grain, department stores, etc., with a total value of more than 21.1 billion.

　　This is only the figure operated by the state-owned trade. If we add the figures operated by private merchants, the output of wool alone for the whole year is more than 18 million catties.

　　Under the policy of free trade, the commerce in large and small markets throughout the province has also rapidly recovered and developed. The number of commercial households has now increased by 1,779 compared with before liberation. In Dulan, near southern Xinjiang, the number of merchants has increased from 23 to 67. The business of all industries has also moved from the depression and desolation before liberation to prosperity and activity. The People's Government's care for the herdsmen can be seen from the exchange of the wool produced by the herdsmen and the tea, cloth, grain, etc. they need. During Ma Bufang's rule, every 100 catties of wool could be exchanged for 2 zhang of blue twill cloth, 2 shi of wheat, and 1.5 bricks of Fu tea; in 1950, every 100 catties of wool could be exchanged for 2.45 bolts of blue twill cloth, 5.8 shi of wheat, and 11.95 bricks of tea. Based on the above-mentioned 8.24 million catties of wool, in the past it could only be exchanged for 16,482 bolts of cloth, 164,624 shi of wheat, and 123,618 bricks of Fu tea; now it can be exchanged for 201,909 bolts of cloth, 984,823 bricks of Fu tea, and 477,989 shi of wheat. If we add the more than 10 million catties of wool exported by private merchants, the welfare gained by the people will increase more than twofold.

　　　　The Sun Shines on the Bayan Har Mountains

　　The nomadic people in the Guoluo area, scattered north and south of the Bayan Har Mountains at the source of the Yellow River, who had been living an inhuman life and cut off from the outside world during the Ma Bufang's rule, have now also begun to come to Huangyuan to sell wool and buy grain, cloth, and tea. They have gained unexpected equal treatment and economic benefits. An intellectual among them wrote in Tibetan:

　　"Chairman Mao is like the sun,
　　　　Warming people,
　　　　Cattle and sheep are also healthy;
　　　　Ma Bufang is like ice and snow,
　　　　The sun comes out and melts,
　　　　There will be no good end."

　　And wrote:

　　"Drinking cow blood and eating wild fruits, we have not broken bread (been together) for more than thirty years. Today, we pack Qing barley bag after bag;
　　Chairman Mao is our savior!"

　　　　★　　　　★　　　　★

　　Now, the state-owned trading companies in various parts of Qinghai are working hard to conduct direct trade with the brotherly nationalities in the form of trade teams, bringing trade policies to every tent.

### 太阳照耀着青海草原——毛主席的贸易政策带给青海各民族农牧民的幸福

　　太阳照耀着青海草原      
    ——毛主席的贸易政策带给青海各民族农牧民的幸福
    青海省人民政府商业厅长　薛宏福
    青海解放以后，人民政府正确地执行了民族政策和贸易政策，人民的生活和生产情绪都提高了。拦羊的青年男女，都穿上了新新的红色或青色的斜纹布衣服，愉快地牧着羊，唱着歌。牧民们多方面地研究如何把羊儿喂肥，多产羊毛。贵德县藏民秋尔吉说：“马步芳剥去我们的衣服，毛主席给我们穿上了衣服。毛主席是太阳，暖烘烘地照在我们身上。”各种带色的斜纹布、礼帽、白面，现在已流行在游牧区了。蒙藏人民和人民政府的干部见面时，总是举起个大拇指表示感谢。不少人到了湟源、西宁，总要把毛主席像带回家去。兴海县的藏族妇女在过年时，穿着新的棉袍（代替舞衣）跳着舞高唱着：“共产党是我们的父亲，解放军是我们的母亲，工作人员是我们的兄弟姊妹，他们拯救了我们，我们康乐，我们的牛羊肥壮。”
            三十年来的遭遇
    青海居住着回、汉、蒙、藏、土、撒拉、哈沙等七个民族。这里有辽阔的天然草原，有一望无际的盐田，盛产驰名中外的羊毛和销行世界的大黄，还有埋藏在地下的黄金。但是，在解放以前，在马步芳匪帮几十年来的黑暗统治下，城市凋敝，商业萧条，农、牧民大量破产，或贫困不堪。不少善良人民为生计所迫，或外出流亡，或起而反抗。在湟源一带，有许多出卖子女的凄惨事实。
    马匪步芳为了有计划地掠夺各族人民的财产，在全省各县设立“德兴海”商店（老百姓称它为“百姓害”），以极低的价格强买青海所产的皮毛、大黄等，而以极高的价格，把大宗茶、布，卖给牧民。牧民百斤羊毛，仅可换到茯茶一封半（每封六斤），宽面细布二丈，麦子二市石。果洛区的藏民不肯俯首屈服，曾遭到马匪多年的武装惨杀，三十年来和外界隔绝了经济关系。他们的羊毛、酥油、牛皮等，被封冻在本地，成为废物。他们不得不终年挖草根、杀牲畜、喝牛血、穿羊皮过活。因此，青海的羊，在马匪统治时期迅速地减少。同仁县过去有羊八十万只，刚解放时已不到二十万只了。牧民终年见不到白面。冬天穿不上棉衣的，更是普遍。人民购买力的极度低弱，加上马匪对市场的垄断，青海的工业就更不用提了。西宁仅有的皮革、火柴、肥皂等八个工厂，比不上大城市的作坊。商业也一样：湟源县在一九二九年时是青海羊毛集散之地，商店很多。到一九三○年后被马匪“德兴海”操纵排挤，外商他往，本地商号也陆续倒闭了。
            解放以后
    一九四九年九月五日，青海解放了。这是各族人民大团结与生活改善的开端。人民政府首先注意用公平的价格来收购农牧民的生产品。
    一九五○年国营贸易公司在青海收购羊毛八百二十四万多斤，肠衣七万三千多根，食粮五万四千多石，还有大黄等十六种土产。在大量收购土、特产中，共投放人民币八百五十六亿以上，折合四十码宽面大布二十八万五千余匹（每匹三十万元），茶叶一百四十二万七千余封（每封六斤，价六万元），面粉八千五百六十六万余斤（每斤一千元）。
    贸易公司特别注意供给各族人民以日用品。在上述期间，共供应大布、土布、茶叶、粮食、百货等，总值达二百十一亿以上。
    这仅是国营贸易所经营的数字。如果把私商经营的数字加进去，全年只羊毛一项即输出一千八百多万斤。
    在贸易自由的政策下，全省大小市场的商业，也迅速地恢复和发展起来。商业户数，现已较解放前增多了一千七百七十九家。靠近新疆南部的都兰，商户由二十三家增到六十七家。各行业的生意，也由解放前的萧条冷落走向繁荣活跃。人民政府对牧民的照顾，可以从牧民生产的羊毛与他们所需的茶、布、粮等交换的情形中看出来。在马匪统治时期，羊毛每百斤换青斜布二丈，小麦二市石，茯茶一封半；一九五○年，每百斤羊毛可换青斜布二·四五匹，麦子五·八市石，茶叶一一·九五封。以上述八百二十四万多斤羊毛计算，过去只能换到大布一六、四八二匹，小麦一六四、六二四市石，茯茶一二三、六一八封；现在能换到大布二○一、九○九匹，茯茶九八四、八二三封，小麦四七七、九八九市石。如果再加上私商输出羊毛一千万多斤，人民所得的福利就要增加一倍以上。
            太阳照在巴颜喀喇山上
    散居在黄河源头巴颜喀喇山南北，在马匪步芳统治的年代中一直过着非人生活，和外界断绝了来往的果洛区游牧民族，现在也开始到湟源来出售羊毛，购买粮食、布匹和茶叶了。他们获得了意想不到的平等待遇和经济利益。他们中间的一个知识分子用藏文写道：
    “毛主席像太阳，
      暖烘烘的照在人身上，
        牛羊也健壮；
        马步芳像冰雪，
          太阳出来融化光，
            终久没有好下场。”
    又写道：
    “喝牛血，吃野果，三十多年没破伙（在一起的意思）。今天，一袋一袋装青裸；
    毛主席就是我们的救星啊！”
　　    ★           ★           ★
    现在，青海各地的国营贸易公司正用贸易小组的形式努力争取与各兄弟民族进行直接贸易，把贸易政策带到每个帐篷里去。
