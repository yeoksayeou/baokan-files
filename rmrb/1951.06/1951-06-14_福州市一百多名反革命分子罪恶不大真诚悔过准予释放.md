Fuzhou Municipal People's Government recently released 136 counter-revolutionaries whose crimes were not serious and who sincerely repented. After a long period of education by the People's Government, these released counter-revolutionaries sincerely confessed their past crimes, revealed information about reactionary organizations, and handed over reactionary documents. Some even assisted the People's Government in arresting counter-revolutionary ringleaders. The People's Government granted these counter-revolutionaries exemption from punishment and release. For example, Yu Yixian, a special agent who had participated in the bandit "Maritime Security Team" organization, was able to thoroughly confess and repent after being arrested, leading public security personnel to arrest the bandit organization's ringleaders, Yang Yidi, and two others, and handing over three pistols. After being released from punishment, Yu Yixian has now joined the Fuzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Team. Some counter-revolutionaries with minor offenses have been handed over to the masses for supervision by the Municipal People's Government. When releasing this group of counter-revolutionaries, the Fuzhou Municipal People's Government conducted discussions with residents in the areas where the counter-revolutionaries lived, and then held mass meetings to release them on the spot. Those who were leniently released unanimously thanked the People's Government for its leniency and expressed their determination to transform themselves through labor under the leadership of the People's Government and the supervision of the masses in the future.

　　福州市一百多名反革命分子罪恶不大真诚悔过准予释放
    福州市人民政府最近先后释放了一百三十六名罪恶不大、真诚悔过的反革命分子。这些被释放的反革命分子在经过人民政府长时期的教育后，真诚地坦白了过去的罪恶，供出反动组织情况，交出反动证件。有的并协助人民政府逮捕了反革命匪首。人民政府对这些反革命分子准予免刑释放。如曾参加匪“海上保安队”组织的特务分子游依显，在被逮捕以后能够彻底坦白悔悟，带领公安人员逮捕了该匪组织的匪首杨依弟等三人，并交出短枪三支。游依显免刑释放后，现已参加福州市修筑工程队工作。有一些犯罪较轻的反革命分子，已由市人民政府交予人民群众管制。福州市人民政府在释放这批反革命分子时，都经过各该反革命分子居住地区的居民讨论，然后举行群众大会当场释放。被宽大释放的人一致感谢人民政府对他们的宽大，并表示今后决心在人民政府领导和群众监督下，在劳动中改造自己。                    （新华社）
