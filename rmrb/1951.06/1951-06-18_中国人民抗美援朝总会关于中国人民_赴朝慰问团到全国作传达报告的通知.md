　　Notice from the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea Regarding the China People's Delegation for Comforting Korea Making Reports Across the Country
　　Since the China People's Delegation for Comforting Korea returned to the country, it has recently departed from Beijing to go to various parts of the country to make reports to people from all walks of life. Their mission is to report to the people in every city and county across the country, within a period of two to three months, on their experiences comforting in Korea and the actual situation on the Korean front, and to convey the Volunteers' concern and hope for the people of the motherland. Through this, we will conduct another universal and in-depth patriotic education among the people of the whole country, promote the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, and mobilize the people of the whole country to actively respond to the three major appeals of this committee: universally implement patriotic pacts, enthusiastically donate airplanes and artillery, and do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, in order to strive for the early and complete victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea. After the sub-delegations of the Comforting Delegation return to their respective regions, in addition to maintaining contact with the General Delegation Headquarters in Beijing, their daily work will be guided by the local People's Representative Conference Consultative Committees or Standing Committees, and will be directly led by the General Sub-Committees and Sub-Committees of this Committee in various regions. It is hoped that the General Sub-Committees and Sub-Committees of this Committee in various regions, and the People's Representative Conference Consultative Committees or Standing Committees in various regions, will adopt the following measures to guide and assist them in carrying out their work:
　　(1) After they arrive, assign an appropriate number of capable personnel to guide and assist their work, and go to the masses with them to make reports.
　　(2) Help them understand the actual local situation, and assist them in formulating publicity plans and key content according to the needs of local work. Before the summer harvest, they can first conduct publicity in cities and industrial and mining areas, and then go to the countryside for publicity after the summer harvest.
　　(3) Their activities should be fully publicized in the newspapers, so that the impact of their work can be maximized.
　　(4) Before and after their arrival, organize the masses to respond to the three major appeals of this committee, and pay special attention to using their reports to launch a nationwide movement to increase production and donate weapons.
　　(5) After they have made reports to the people, help them collect feedback from the masses, and summarize experiences and improve their work.
　　After the work of each working group of the Comforting Delegation is completed, the provincial and municipal sub-committees of this committee should submit a written summary report to this committee.
