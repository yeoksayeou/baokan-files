　　Shijiazhuang's Industrial and Commercial Circles Advance in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　Guo Fengming
　　In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the political understanding of Shijiazhuang's industrial and commercial circles has gradually improved. They actively participate in patriotic activities, strive to improve their business operations, enthusiastically pay national taxes, and labor-management relations have become more united.
　　　　　　I. Actively Participate in Patriotic Movements, One Upsurge Following Another
　　The patriotic movement of Shijiazhuang's industrial and commercial circles has been like waves pushing forward, with one upsurge following another. Since last November, they have held more than ten small-scale current affairs symposiums, compiled the conclusions, and formulated a patriotic pact for the industrial and commercial circles. Following this, they launched campaigns to guarantee not to listen to reactionary broadcasts and to donate materials and funds to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces and to aid Korean refugees. On January 8th of this year, more than 6,000 people from the industrial and commercial circles enthusiastically held a parade and demonstration in the wind and snow to celebrate the liberation of Seoul. In mid-March, in order to oppose the United States arming Japan, the industrial and commercial circles universally denounced the crimes of imperialism, traitors, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. During the large-scale popularization campaign in the city in April, the industrial and commercial circles once again received universal education. The vast majority of industries, based on the patriotic pact of the city's industrial and commercial circles, formulated specific implementation guidelines for their respective industries. All stores arranged window displays for propaganda. The city's industrial and commercial circles enthusiastically participated in the "May 1st" parade and demonstration, the signing in support of the Five Great Powers concluding a peace treaty, and the voting against arming Japan. Everyone's patriotic enthusiasm has become even higher, their confidence in the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea has become even more firm, and they have become more active in business operations.
　　　　　　II. Under the Banner of Patriotism, Strive to Improve Business Operations
　　Under the encouragement of slogans such as "Intensify Production, Resist America, Aid Korea" and "Develop Material Exchanges, Smash the American Blockade," the industrial and commercial circles actively improved their operations. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, they massively organized joint operations and promoted contract business. From February to now, forty-one joint operation organizations have been established in the city, including more than 300 households in thirty-two industries. Among the city's industrial and commercial households, 48.5 percent have signed business transaction contracts with the Shijiazhuang Central Branch of the People's Bank of China; 333 households have signed various business contracts with state-owned and public enterprises. Some industries, in order to avoid wasting cash, stipulated in their patriotic pacts that all daily sales proceeds, except for necessary expenses, must be immediately deposited in the bank. Some industries have also begun to make business plans. Labor-management relations have also been improving daily as both sides' political awareness has increased. Since the second half of last year, eleven small factories have launched patriotic labor competitions. Eleven industries have established labor-management consultation meetings, and seven industries have signed labor-management collective contracts. Some industries have proposed in their patriotic pacts to guarantee workers' spare time for study and to provide workers with study supplies. Industrialists and businessmen have gradually realized that only by relying on workers and shop assistants can they develop their businesses.
　　These proactive actions of the industrial and commercial circles have powerfully coordinated with the government's various measures to develop industry and commerce. Coupled with the favorable conditions of increased purchasing power of farmers, Shijiazhuang's industry and commerce has accelerated its development. Production has increased, the trade network has reached as far as Northeast China and the Jiangnan region, and material exchanges are unprecedentedly prosperous. According to statistics from thirty-two industries, the turnover in March of this year increased by 141 percent compared to July of last year (the early stage of the US imperialist's launching of the war of aggression against Korea).
　　　　　　III. Enthusiastically Pay Taxes, Developing from Clearing Overdue Payments and Prepaying Taxes to the "Self-Examination and Tax Supplement" Movement
　　Another patriotic action of the industrial and commercial circles is to enthusiastically pay national taxes. They are striving to realize the clause in the patriotic pact of "Completing national taxes, not making false reports, not evading taxes, not delaying payments, and ensuring national income." Since the beginning of this year, the vast majority of businesses have adopted uniform delivery invoices and established account books, which have facilitated tax collection according to accounts and rates. In the first half of March, Shijiazhuang cleared the overdue tax payments from last year. At that time, under the slogan of "Striving to Be a Model," seven industries paid 85 percent of their payable taxes in five days. In early April, among the city's seventy-four industries, twenty-seven industries collectively paid taxes to welcome the return of representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. At the end of April, sixty-nine industries collectively prepaid national taxes to welcome the "May 1st" holiday. In early May, the department store industry automatically launched a "self-examination and tax supplement" movement to voluntarily declare and supplement taxes for the unreported turnover in 1950. In three days, they voluntarily supplemented the reported turnover of 700 million yuan. Now, the situation of tax work in Shijiazhuang is very different from before. Not only does the tax bureau not need to urge collection, but also industrial and commercial households often ask the tax bureau to issue tax invoices in advance to compete in making collective early payments. They have realized that paying taxes is a glorious obligation that the industrial and commercial circles should fulfill.
　　　　　　IV. Educate Everyone through Accusations and Comparisons; Key Members Take the Lead to Continue to Promote the Patriotic Movement
　　In leading the industrial and commercial circles in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the Shijiazhuang Federation of Industry and Commerce has gained two relatively successful experiences: First, it is to inspire the anti-American and patriotic emotions of the industrial and commercial circles through accusations, reminiscences, and comparisons. Like other small and medium-sized cities, the cultural level of the general industrialists and businessmen in Shijiazhuang is not very high; they have suffered deeply from the devastation of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. The Federation of Industry and Commerce grasped this characteristic, and when conducting patriotic education for them, they paid attention to giving fewer large reports at the beginning, but continuously held accusation meetings and inspired them to recall and compare their lives before and after liberation, so as to educate themselves with their own personal experiences. In mid-March, more than 2,600 households from various industries in the city participated in accusation meetings, accounting for 68 percent of the total number of industrial and commercial households in the city; 296 people publicly accused the crimes of imperialism, traitors, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. These have the greatest educational significance for industrialists and businessmen.
　　Secondly, give full play to the leading role of activists. In each upsurge of the patriotic movement, many activists have emerged in the industrial and commercial circles. Eighty of these activists have been selected as representatives to attend the Shijiazhuang People's Representative Conference of All Circles Against America and Aid Korea. They have been further educated at the conference. After returning, they are at the forefront of their respective industries in every movement, leading everyone and making each industry unwilling to lag behind. If industry A pays national taxes first, industry B will come up with new methods to surpass them. This allows the patriotic movement to gradually deepen and develop to a higher stage. During the widespread accusation movement in March, many industry committee members went to "visit the sufferers" from house to house, using suffering to evoke suffering and guiding everyone to make accusations. During the popularization and propaganda movement before the "May 1st" holiday, 55 factory and store managers, together with cadres and students, formed propaganda teams and went deep into various industrial and commercial households to conduct propaganda, so that the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen in the city received patriotic education.
　　At the end of April, the Shijiazhuang Federation of Industry and Commerce held its second representative conference. The resolution of the meeting called on the representatives to take the lead in thoroughly implementing the patriotic pact, and required every household and everyone to fulfill the patriotic pact with the greatest strength. The industrial and commercial circles of Shijiazhuang are continuing to advance in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.

　　石家庄市工商界在抗美援朝运动中前进
    郭烽明
    在抗美援朝运动中，石家庄市工商界的政治认识逐步提高，积极参加爱国活动，努力改进经营，踊跃缴纳国税，劳资双方也更加团结。
            一、积极参加爱国运动，一次高潮紧接着一次高潮
    石家庄市工商界的爱国运动，是一个波浪推动一个波浪，一个高潮紧接着一个高潮地开展起来的。去年十一月起，他们连续举行了十多次小型时事座谈会，把结论汇集起来，订立了工商界的爱国公约。接着又展开了保证不收听反动广播和捐献物资款项慰劳中朝人民部队与救济朝鲜难民等工作。今年一月八日，工商界六千多人在风雪中热烈地举行庆祝汉城解放游行示威大会。三月中旬，为了反对美国武装日本，工商界普遍控诉帝国主义、汉奸、蒋匪的罪行。在四月份全市大规模的普及宣传中，工商界又一次普遍地受到了教育。绝大部分行业根据全市工商界的爱国公约，订出了本行业的具体执行纲领。各商店都布置了橱窗宣传。全市工商界热烈地参加了“五一”游行示威和拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名与反对武装日本的投票。大家的爱国热情更加高涨，对抗美援朝必胜的信心更加坚定，对业务经营也更加积极。
            二、在爱国主义的旗帜下，努力改进经营
    在“加紧生产，抗美援朝”，“开展物资交流，粉碎美国封锁”等口号的鼓舞下，工商界积极改善了经营。他们在国营经济的领导下，大规模地组织联营并推行合同业务。从二月份到现在，全市建立了四十一个联营组织，包括三十二个行业的三百多户。全市工商户中，百分之四十八点五与中国人民银行石家庄中心支行订立了业务来往合同；三百三十三户与国营、公营企业订立了各种业务合同。有的行业为了避免现金的浪费，在爱国公约中规定：每日销货进款，除必要开支外，都要立即存入银行。有的行业并开始作经营计划。劳资关系也随着双方政治觉悟的提高而日趋改善。去年下半年起，有十一个小型工厂开展了爱国劳动竞赛。十一个行业建立了劳资协商会议，七个行业订立了劳资集体合同。有的行业在爱国公约中提出保证工人的业余学习时间，并供给工人学习用品。工商业者逐渐认识到只有依靠工人店员才能发展业务。
    工商界的这些积极行动，有力地配合了政府发展工商业的各种措施，加上农民购买力提高的有利条件，使石家庄市工商业加速发展起来。生产增加了，贸易网远达东北和江南，物资交流空前畅旺。据三十二个行业统计，今年三月的营业额比去年七月（美帝国主义发动侵朝战争初期）增加了百分之一百四十一。
            三、踊跃纳税，从清理尾欠、预交税款发展到“自查补税”运动
    工商界另一爱国行动是踊跃交纳国税。他们努力实现爱国公约中“完成国税，不虚报，不漏税，不迟交，保证国家收入”的条款。今年起绝大部分商户采用了统一的发货票，建立了账簿，便利了按账依率收税。三月上半月，石家庄市清理了去年税收的尾欠。当时有七个行业在“争取作模范”的口号下，五天中交完了应纳税款的百分之八十五。四月初，全市七十四个行业中，二十七个行业以集体交税来欢迎志愿军归国代表的来到。四月底，六十九个行业以集体预交国税来迎接“五一”节。五月初，百货业又自动掀起了“自查补税”运动，要把一九五○年漏报的营业额自行申报补税。三天中他们就自动补报了营业额七亿元。现在，石家庄市税收工作情形大不同前了。不独不须税局催收，而且还常有工商户请税局提前开发税票，作集体早交的竞赛。他们认识了纳税是工商界应尽的光荣义务。
            四、以控诉、对比来教育大家；骨干分子带头，继续推进爱国运动
    在领导工商界进行抗美援朝运动中，石家庄市工商联合会取得了两点比较成功的经验：首先，是以控诉回忆、对比来启发工商界的反美爱国情绪。石家庄市和其他中小城市一样，一般工商业者的文化水平不很高；他们曾饱受帝国主义和国内反动派的摧残。工商联合会掌握了这一特点，在向他们进行爱国教育时，一开始就注意了少作大报告，而是连续不断地举行控诉会，并启发他们回忆、对比解放前后的生活，以他们的切身经验来教育自己。三月中旬，全市各行业有二千六百多户参加了控诉会，占全市工商户总数的百分之六十八；有二百九十六人当众控诉了帝国主义和汉奸、蒋匪等的罪行。这些，对工商业者的教育意义最大。
    其次，充分发挥积极分子的带头作用。每一次爱国运动的高潮里，工商界中都涌现出不少积极分子。这些积极分子中有八十人已被选为出席石家庄市各界人民反美爱国代表会议的代表。他们在会议上又受到了教育。回去之后，在每一次运动中都走在自己行业的最前列，带动了大家，使每个行业都不甘落后。甲行业先缴了国税，乙行业就想出新办法来追过他们，这样就使爱国运动逐步深入，逐步向更高的阶段发展。在三月份普遍开展控诉运动时，有许多行业委员逐户去“访苦”，以苦引苦，引导大家控诉。在“五一”节前的普及宣传运动中，有五十五名厂店经理，协同干部、学生组成宣传队，深入各工商户宣传，使全市绝大多数工商业者都受到了爱国教育。
    四月末，石家庄市工商界举行了首届二次代表会议。会议的决议中号召代表们带头把爱国公约深入贯彻，要求每一户、每一人都以最大力量来履行爱国公约。石家庄市的工商界，正在抗美援朝爱国运动中继续前进。
