An Extremely Reactionary Novel
    ——A Critique of "The Eternal Beggar"
        Kang Zhuo
    In addition to the film, picture biography, and comic strip about Wu Xun, there is also a sixty-thousand-word chapter novel entitled "The Eternal Beggar." This is the sixth popular book published by Shanghai Tonglian Bookstore, edited by He Gongchao and written by Bai Shui. It was published in January of this year, coinciding with the premiere of Sun Yu's film and the distribution of Li Shizhao's picture biography. Like the film and picture biography, the novel erroneously glorifies Wu Xun.
    At the beginning of the novel, the revolution is portrayed in a distorted manner. The author says that Wu Xun was "born to welcome the turbulent historical era of China a hundred years ago" (Chapter 1), an era that "was facing crises both at home and abroad. Many young men were conscripted by the Qing government to deal with the Opium War, and some participated in the Nian Rebellion" (Chapter 4). However, it also says that "at that time, due to the oppression and exploitation of feudal forces... some farmers became bandits" (Chapter 1), "When 'Little Yama' (a general in the Nian Rebellion) rebelled in the third year of Xianfeng, Linqing Prefecture was once captured, resulting in the desolation of nine out of ten households" (Chapter 14), while Wu Xun "caught up with such an era, which also determined his life's fate," making him "China's greatest social educator" (both Chapter 1). According to the author's logic, the revolutionary peasants at that time were "bandits," and Linqing became "desolate" because of the sins of these "bandits." As for Wu Xun, the "era" destined him to stay away from the "bandits" and become the "greatest educator."
    This is an open promotion of the feudal class and bourgeois reactionary thought, using the guise of a so-called "educator" to oppose revolutionary peasants, using education to replace revolution, and openly exposing the reactionary reformists' attempt to usurp the achievements of the people's revolution. Let us see how the author completes this propaganda attempt.
    The author unreservedly praises Wu Xun's slavish thinking and character. The author says: Shandong people "call Wu Qi 'bean curd dregs,' satirizing him for being muddleheaded and unable to distinguish between good and bad," "When people treat him well, he works faithfully without any expression; when people treat him badly, he still works faithfully without any expression." This is the people's correct evaluation of Wu Xun; however, the author disagrees with this evaluation. The author writes that Wu Xun "knows in his heart that without working and enduring, he would have no food to eat; what's the use of saying a few words of gratitude or complaining and grumbling? Can that be eaten? He knows that everything else is nonsense, eating is the most important thing, and labor must be the most important thing. Therefore, although he is beaten and scolded, he always endures it silently, without saying a word of complaint, without showing a hint of resentment" (all Chapter 2). The author praises such a lowly character as a "hero," and even opposes complaining and grumbling against the feudal rulers. Here, the author's own stance is exposed; he obviously insists on this stance.
    Therefore, regarding Wu Xun's motivation for establishing schools, the author also "frankly" expresses his views, revealing a bit of the truth. "Having neither power nor knowing a single character" (Chapter 3), he wanted to run free schools, and he even knelt to beg the Jinshi (successful candidates in the imperial examinations) to jointly run the school (Chapter 9) in order to gain this power.
    Regarding Wu Xun's usurious exploitation, the author does not avoid it like the film, but rather describes it in detail, saying that "the interest rate is set at a maximum of 30% and a minimum of 22%," "Due to the sincere cooperation of Yang, Lou, and others, it developed more rapidly and has formed a lending institution" (all Chapter 10). As for why he lent money, it was said that the money "cannot generate interest if it is kept in hand, and it must be protected against thieves" (Chapter 9); the so-called thieves, according to the author, are naturally the Taiping Army and the Nian Rebellion. Moreover, "lending money is the fastest way to get rich. Those big landlords all got rich by lending money at high interest rates," Wu Xun "does not lend money, but the landlords still have to lend money. The poor will not be less poor just because he does not lend money. If he lends money, the poor may benefit a little" (all Chapter 7). What a "profound" explanation! Let's look again: Wu Xun "has not had a debt dispute for decades" because "the prestige of Yang, Lou, and others suppressed all evil spirits" (all Chapter 10); here, the author obviously calls the power of the feudal rulers "prestige" with envy, and shamelessly smears the poor peasants as "evil spirits." How bold and rampant is the author, Mr. Bai Shui! Isn't this set of his arguments openly supporting feudal exploitation and rule precisely what the vast number of peasants are vehemently opposing and suppressing today?
    The author also positively describes and praises Wu Xun's idea that "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving things" (Chapter 4), as well as the feudal behaviors of "buying land to give to filial widows" (Chapter 13) and matchmaking (Chapter 14). As for kneeling and kowtowing to the landlord class, it is described and praised with relish (Chapter 9, 10); when Wu Xun met the executioner Zhang Yao, although it was rendered as an ugly feudal style of "bowing but not kneeling," as a noted personage, but as soon as Zhang Yao donated silver and bestowed him with a permit, he "immediately kowtowed and thanked him" (all Chapter 12). Later, Wu Xun accumulated money and bought land, and handed it all over to the Jinshi for management, while he himself "still worked as a hired hand and begged" (Chapter 11); this fully shows that it was no longer Wu Xun who was running the free school, nor was it just him cooperating with the Jinshi in running the free school, but that he had become an extremely obedient slave and tool of the ruling class, and was flaunting each other with the ruling class. Later, when Tangyi County Magistrate Guo Chunxu gave Wu Xun a name, it was because "Wu Qi is a small name, and people with status cannot always use a small name, at least they should have a formal name like the landlord class or intellectuals" (Chapter 12); after Zhang Yao bestowed Wu Xun with a permit, "Wu Xun became arrogant" (Chapter 13); when the memorial arch was completed and celebrated, "a banquet was set up, and everyone took their seats" (Chapter 13), Wu Xun was completely on an equal footing with the Jinshi and the county magistrate. Faced with this fact, the author still does not admit that Wu Xun is a slave of the feudal ruling class, but instead says that Wu Xun is a "great hero"! Mr. Bai Shui's point of view is so different from the people's point of view!
    Of course, the author is not completely "frank." Like the film, the novel distorts historical facts, saying that Wu Xun refused to wear the yellow jacket (Chapter 12). The author also praises Wu Xun's celibacy, and twice describes the reasons why Wu Xun did not marry, which were for the "sacrifice" of the free school and not to spend "public" money (Chapter 10, 14). Regardless of whether this material itself is still very questionable, just looking at this description also accurately shows how the author praises and idealizes Wu Xun's feudal thinking and his extremely obedient "great spirit" and "personality" in serving as a slave to the feudal rulers.
    The author also greatly praises the feudal rulers. The author says that Jinshi Yang Shufang is a "good old gentleman with both good character and enthusiasm for education," and Wu Jinshi (military graduate) Lou Junling and his brother "are both very enthusiastic about education. Lou Junling is a chivalrous person, likes to make friends, is proficient in business, and has planning and organizational skills," and his brother "likes to take care of things, is good at diplomacy, and is not afraid of hardship. Both brothers have a spirit of acting bravely for a just cause and are very fair." And for Yang, Lou, and others, "the people of Tangyi, Guantao, and nearby counties" "have very good comments" (all Chapter 9). Then, let's look at the reason why Tangyi County Magistrate attached importance to Wu Xun's running schools: first, the Empress Dowager Cixi, in order to avoid the "disaster of the imperialist powers dividing up China, accepted the suggestion of the court officials to promote social education in order to cultivate talents, resist foreign aggression, and protect her country"; second, Shandong Governor Zhang Yao "was born as an illiterate poor man... he knows the suffering of the poor, and he knows the suffering of the poor who are illiterate... he especially loves beggars and the poor" (all Chapter 12). The author's conclusion here is first that the imperialist aggression against China at the end of the Qing Dynasty was not caused by the Empress Dowager Cixi's oppression of the people and her seeking glory and profit from foreigners, but that the Empress Dowager was very "patriotic"; second, that the Empress Dowager "promoted social education to save the country," so Wu Xun was valued and became a "great social educator"; again, that the great executioner Zhang Yao and his accomplices who slaughtered the revolutionary peasants were all "just" people who "cared for the poor" and were "well-received by the people." However, who does not know that the Empress Dowager Cixi was precisely the fierce enemy of our nation and people at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and Zhang Yao and others were precisely her accomplices, so Wu Xun was precisely her and their obedient slave! Doesn't the author's description show that his thinking is a feudal ideology plus a bourgeois reactionary ideology that is completely contrary to the people's thinking?
    The author's "artistic" descriptions are also full of ugly images. For example, the motivation for Wu Xun to run schools is that Wu Xun had a dream, dreaming that an old man with a white beard told him how to "give up his life's happiness," how to "work hard" and "labor to produce" for the "poor children to go to school" (Chapter 3); this is completely the formula of the declining class's literary and artistic creation that is against realism, and like the dream in the film, it makes people suspect that the authors copied it from American reactionary literature and art. The author's extremely inferior artistic skills and his anti-realistic artistic techniques that do his utmost to distort the truth are originally completely adapted to his reactionary ideology.
    There are many other errors in the book, such as openly praising Wu Xun for thinking that being a hired worker is "unpromising" and that feudal education "is a service to the people."
    The author's book is based entirely on the materials of the reactionary rulers of the past, and the author's conclusions are also entirely the conclusions of the reactionary rulers of the past. However, at the beginning, the author named Wu Xun "China's greatest social educator," and at the end, he was even carried away, calling him a "great man of a generation," insisting that "he was born for the proletariat, lived as a friend of the proletariat; he died for the proletariat, and after death, he shared a tomb with the proletariat" (Chapter 15); without asking where Wu Xun's life was connected with the proletariat from any corner of the world, may I ask: just based on the author's description, is it not enough to show that Wu Xun was clearly an obedient slave and tool of the feudal ruling class at the end of the Qing Dynasty? Isn't it clear that he was born for the feudal ruling class, living as a slave to the feudal ruling class; dying for the feudal ruling class, and receiving long-term praise from the rulers after his death? The author forcibly rewrites "feudal ruling class" as "proletariat" and puts the ruler's, that is, the author's own, conclusion with the noblest words of our praise for people's heroes! For these progressive words, the author also tried to cover up. Shouldn't such cover-ups be exposed; shouldn't such reactionary works that slander the revolution and distort the traditions of the people be severely criticized?

　　一本极端反动的小说
    ——评《千古奇丐》
        康濯
    歌颂武训的文艺作品，除了电影、画传和连环画以外，还有一本六万多字的章回小说《千古奇丐》。这是上海通联书店印行的第六种通俗图书，何公超主编，柏水著，今年一月出版，与孙瑜电影的公演、李士钊画传的发行，恰恰是同时。小说也和电影同画传一样，对武训进行了错误的歌颂。
    小说一开头，就对革命作了歪曲的描写。作者说武训是“迎接着中国百年前风云起伏的大历史时代而降生的”（第一回），那时代“正面临着内忧外患的危机，许多青年壮年被满清政府征募了去应付鸦片战争，有的又参加了捻党的革命工作”（第四回），可是又说“那时因受封建势力的压迫剥削……一部分农民流为盗贼”（第一回），“咸丰三年‘小阎王（捻党中的将领）造反’的时候，临清州曾被攻陷，以至十室九空”（第十四回），而武训“赶上这样的时代，也就注定了他一生的命运”，使他成了“中国最伟大的社会教育家”（均第一回）。根据作者的逻辑，当时革命的农民乃是“盗贼”而临清变得“十室九空”，就是这些“盗贼”的罪过；至于武训，“时代”给他注定的命运，就是逍遥在“盗贼”以外，成了“最伟大的教育家”。
    这是封建阶级和资产阶级反动思想的公开的宣传，是以所谓“教育家”的招牌，反对革命农民；以教育来代替革命，并且是为反动的改良主义者企图篡夺人民革命的功劳的公开的暴露。让我们来看作者是怎样完成这个宣传企图的。
    作者毫不掩饰地歌颂着武训的奴才思想和性格。作者说：山东人“管武七叫豆沫，是讽刺他稀里糊涂，分不出好坏来”，“人家待他好，他忠实工作，没有表示；待他坏，他也是忠实工作，没有表示”。这是人民对于武训的正确的评价；然而，作者对这种评价却表示不同意。作者写道：武训“心里有数，不工作，不忍耐，就没有饭吃；说几句感恩的话或者抱怨，发牢骚，有啥用呢？能当饭吃吗？他晓得别的都是瞎扯，吃饭第一，劳动就得第一。所以，虽然挨打受骂，他总是逆来顺受，不说一句怨话，不带一点怨色”（均第二回）。作者把这样的下贱性格歌颂成“英雄”，连对封建统治者的抱怨和牢骚都要加以反对，这里，就暴露了作者自己的立场；他对这种立场显然是坚持着的。
    因此，对于武训兴学的动机，作者也就“坦白”地表示了自己的观点，透露了一点真相。“既没有势力，又不认识一个字”（第三回），于是要办义学，于是还要跪求进士共同办学（第九回）以便获得这种势力。
    对于武训的高利贷剥削，作者也没有像电影那样避开不谈，而是大加描写，说“利息约定最高三分，最低二分二厘”，“由于杨娄三人的精诚合作，发展得更为迅速，已形成一个放债机关”（均第十回）。至于为什么要放债，说是钱“留在手中又没法生息，还得防备盗贼”（第九回）；所谓盗贼，按作者的说法，自然是太平军和捻党了。而且“放账发财发的快。那些大地主，都是放高利贷发的财”，武训“不放账，地主也得放账。穷人不能因为他不放账就不致于穷得更厉害。他要是放了账，穷人也许沾点光”（均第七回）。多么“深刻”的解释啊！再看：武训“数十年没发生过债务纠纷”，是“由于杨娄三氏的威望，压住了一切邪气”（均第十回）；作者在这里显然把他自己羡慕地把封建统治者的势力称之为“威望”，而不如羞耻地把贫苦农民污蔑成“邪气”。作者柏水“先生”是多么大胆和猖狂！他这套公开拥护封建剥削和统治的论调，不正是今天广大的农民在轰轰烈烈加以反对，加以镇压的么？
    作者还正面描写与歌颂了武训认为“男女授受不亲”（第四回）的思想，以及“买地赠孝妇”（第十三回）和做媒（第十四回）的封建行为。至于对地主阶级下跪磕头，更描写与歌颂得津津有味（第九、十回）；武训见刽子手张曜的时候，虽被煊染为“长揖不拜”的丑恶的封建名士派头，但一到张曜捐了银子赐了缘簿，“立刻就磕头道谢”（均第十二回）。后来武训积了钱也买了田，一概交进士经管，他自己“照常佣工乞讨”（第十一回）；这完全说明了已不是什么武训在办义学，也不只是他与进士们在合作办义学，而是他已成为一个极驯顺的统治阶级的奴才和工具，并与统治阶级互相标榜罢了。再后来，堂邑知县郭春煦给武训起名字时候，则是“武七是个小名，有身份的人不能永远用小名行世，起码应该跟地主阶级或知识分子一样有一个大号”（第十二回）；张曜赐给武训缘簿以后，“武训可抖起来了”（第十三回）；庆贺牌坊落成的时候，“摆好酒席，大家入座”（第十三回），武训已完全与进士知县们平起平坐了。面对这事实，作者还不承认武训是封建统治阶级的奴才，反而说得出武训是“伟大英雄”！柏水“先生”的观点与人民的观点竟是这样地毫无相同之处！
    自然，作者也并不是完全“坦白”的。小说也和电影一样，歪曲了历史事实，说武训拒穿黄马褂（第十二回）。作者还歌颂武训的不娶妻，两次描写了武训不娶妻的原因，是为义学的“牺牲”与不花“公家”的钱（第十、十四回），姑不论这材料本身还很值得怀疑，单看这描写，也恰好表现了作者对武训的封建思想，及其极驯顺地充当封建统治者的奴才的“伟大精神”和“人格”是如何推崇，而加以理想化。
    作者对于封建统治者也作了极大的歌颂。作者说进士杨树芳是个“品德兼备”“热心教育的好老先生”，武进士娄峻岭和他的弟弟“都很热心教育。娄峻岭是个侠肝义胆的人，好交朋友，精于事务，有计划性和组织性”，弟弟“喜欢张罗事情，擅长办外交，不怕受辛苦。哥俩都有见义勇为的精神，并且很公正”。而对杨娄三人，“堂邑、馆陶以及附近各县的人民”“都有很好的批评”（均第九回）。那末，再看作者所写堂邑知县重视武训办学的原因：第一是西太后为了避免帝国主义“瓜分之祸，就接受了朝臣的建议，提倡社会教育，以便造就人才，抵抗外患，保护她的江山”；第二是山东巡抚张曜“是个目不识丁的贫汉出身……他知道穷人的苦处，更知道穷人不识字的苦处……他对乞丐跟穷人，特别爱护”（均第十二回）。作者这里的结论，首先是说清末帝国主义对中国的侵略，不是由于西太后的压迫人民和媚外求荣造成的，而西太后倒是很“爱国”的；其次是说西太后“提倡社会教育救国”，因此武训被重视而成为“伟大的社会教育家”；再次，说屠杀革命农民的大刽子手张曜及其帮凶们，都是“爱护穷人”的“公正”的“人民给以好评”的人物。然而，谁人不知西太后正是清末我们民族和人民的凶恶的敌人，张曜等正是她的帮凶，因而武训就正是她和他们的驯顺奴才啊！作者的描写，难道不正说明着他的思想是与人民完全背道而驰的封建思想加资产阶级反动思想么？
    作者的“艺术”描写，也充满着丑恶的形象。如处理武训兴学的动机，是武训作了个梦，梦见个白胡子老头如何叫他“放弃一生的幸福”，如何“艰苦”和“劳动生产”，为“贫苦子弟上学”（第三回）；这完全是反现实主义的没落阶级文艺创作的公式，和电影中的梦一样，使人怀疑作者们是从美国的反动文艺中抄来的。作者这种极端低劣的艺术技巧，这种极尽歪曲能事的反现实主义的艺术手法，原来正是跟他的反动思想完全适应的。
    书中其它错误还很多，如公开歌颂武训认为当长工“没出息”，封建教育“是为人民服务的一种”等。
    作者这本书根据的完全是历代反动统治者的材料，而作者的结论也完全是过去反动统治者的结论。然而，作者一开头就给武训定名为“中国最伟大的社会教育家”，结尾更得意忘形，称之为“一代伟人”，硬说“他为无产阶级而生，生与无产阶级为友；他为无产阶级而死，死后与无产阶级同穴”（第十五回）；姑不问武训的生平从哪个九州外国去联系无产阶级，试问：就仅仅根据作者的描写，已足够说明武训不明明是清末封建统治阶级驯顺的奴才和工具吗？不明明是为封建统治阶级而生，生给封建统治阶级当奴才；为封建统治阶级而死，死后受到统治者长远的歌颂吗？作者硬把“封建统治阶级”公开改写成“无产阶级”，硬把统治者的也即是作者自己的结论，安上个我们歌颂人民英雄的最高贵的字眼！为了这些进步的字眼，作者也曾进行掩饰，对于这样的掩饰，难道不应加以揭露；对于这样污蔑革命，歪曲人民的传统的反动作品，难道不应予以严正的批判吗？
