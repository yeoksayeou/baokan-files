Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi
    Editor's Note: Many readers have written to us requesting that we publish a systematic introduction to grammar and rhetoric to help them learn to write. To meet this demand from our readers, we have commissioned Mr. Lü Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi of Tsinghua University to write a draft of "Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric," which will be serialized starting today, published twice a week.

    Regarding the theories and terminology of grammar in our country, the classification of words, and the analysis of sentence structure, there are still various opinions among grammar and rhetoric scholars in our country. "Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric" written by Mr. Lü and Mr. Zhu represents one of these opinions. We believe that readers can follow the basic rules explained in this talk to learn language knowledge. However, this does not mean that this talk is the final conclusion on grammar and rhetoric in our country. We hope that grammar scholars, rhetoric scholars, and language educators across the country will discuss the many issues involved in this talk and offer suggestions for revisions so that the original authors can refer to and revise it before this talk is printed as a separate book.

       Introduction

    This talk is divided into six lectures: (1) Basic knowledge of grammar, (2) Vocabulary, (3) Function words, (4) Structure, (5) Expression, (6) Punctuation. The first lecture is an introduction, and the following lectures discuss further aspects. The first lecture is specifically for beginners, and readers who already have some grammatical knowledge can skip it. However, it may be helpful to take a look, as the terms used and their meanings may be slightly different from what you originally understood. It is not our intention to be deliberately different, but because there is still a lack of a "common program" among grammar scholars, we have had to make some choices here. The outline of this talk has been revised several times. Initially, we only planned to talk about grammar. Later, we felt that many of the current writing problems are rhetorical problems, so we decided to include some rhetoric after grammar. When arranging the material, we found that such an order was not very appropriate in terms of sequence and difficulty, so we decided to combine these two parts and set it as six lectures, as listed in the table of contents above. However, the rhetoric part is still mainly focused on the negative aspects, and our cultivation limits us from saying much on the positive aspects. It is probably appropriate to have such a boundary when talking about grammar and rhetoric together.

    To make this talk relevant to practice, it is inevitable to make some criticisms, and to make criticisms, there must be a standard. However, our language is in a changing stage, with the language of intellectuals changing faster and more, and the language of workers and peasants changing slower and less, which makes it appear very divergent and difficult to set a standard. However, a standard is still necessary. We certainly should not and cannot adopt a deeply closed and resistant national essence attitude; but we cannot allow blind Europeanization or people who only imitate the ancients to lead us by the nose. Generally speaking, we should take the grammatical rules of modern Chinese as the foundation, appropriately adopt the grammatical rules of foreign languages, and use them to increase the rigor of our language. Classical Chinese components, in today's writing with Chinese characters, are certainly not easy to completely avoid, and sometimes they still contribute to the expressiveness of modern language. But it is also very easy to make mistakes here; in addition to applying the rules of classical Chinese itself to criticize, we must also consider whether it is in harmony with the entire sentence. Our commentary strives to be impartial, not arbitrary; even in some places, we only raise questions, do not draw conclusions, and let everyone discuss and solve them. Even so, I am afraid it will still be difficult to meet everyone's expectations: perhaps some people will think it is too harsh, and perhaps some people will think it is not strict enough. We welcome readers' comments.

    Because this talk focuses on application, the examples cited, whether incorrect or problematic, are far more numerous than the correct ones, and it can be said that they are disproportionate. This is because there are only a handful of correct formats for expressing a meaning, while errors can be "hundreds of kinds." For example, general sentences have a subject, and the subject is coordinated with the predicate. This can be explained in a few sentences and proven with a few examples, but there are many problems in this regard, so more examples must be given. However, this can easily make beginners afraid to write. This is unnecessary. As long as you pay attention when writing and review it after writing, you can naturally reduce errors. Over time, it becomes a habit, and you no longer feel restrained.

    There may also be a reaction that is the opposite of this. After reading our talk, you may find that some famous writers occasionally have situations similar to those pointed out here, and then think that these rules are all self-inflicted by mediocre people and there is no need to pay attention to them. This idea is also wrong. There are many examples of famous writers, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, who have small flaws in their articles. They are able to become famous writers because they have something that is admirable. With this thing, small lapses in review are not worth paying too much attention to. This is what the ancients said, "Do not obscure great virtues with a single flaw." What we should learn is their "great virtue," not their "single flaw." Beginners cannot use the failures of famous writers as their excuses.

    The sources of our example sentences include general books, textbooks, newspapers, periodicals, documents, manuscripts, correspondence, and compositions by university and middle school students; we have not specified the source in detail, but only used the words "book," "text," "news," "periodical," "document," "manuscript," "letter," and "composition" to indicate the type of source. The reason for adopting this method is, on the one hand, to save space, and more importantly, because there are endless books and periodicals, and our knowledge is limited. If we note the names of the books and periodicals, it may create a wrong impression that only these books and periodicals have the most problems, while in fact these books and periodicals may still be of a higher standard. This refers to the erroneous and problematic aspects. Some of the correct example sentences are quoted from existing articles, and only the author is noted, not the title of the article (e.g., "Mao" represents Chairman Mao, "Lu" represents Lu Xun). Some are very common formats and do not need to be cited, so we will write a sentence ourselves without noting anything.

    For the quoted sentences, we will quote the entire sentence if it is not too long. However, due to space limitations and to avoid distracting readers, we sometimes have to delete part of it before or after; unless necessary, we did not use the "..." symbol. In current articles, sentences are very long and can often be divided into several sentences. The excerpts we take are mostly independent. Secondly, a sentence often has problems in several places at the same time. We have to pick one out and discuss it in a certain category of problems, but it may mislead readers into thinking that other parts of the sentence have no problems. Our method is: example sentences from books and periodicals are generally placed in parentheses as supplementary explanations; manuscripts and compositions will correct unimportant errors and leave the main one for discussion.

    The proofreading work of current books and periodicals is not serious enough, especially newspapers (according to our experience, the People's Daily is an exception); therefore, there are inevitably some sentences that are not the original appearance of the author. In this suspected situation, we would rather not use that sentence; it is inevitable that there are still failures to distinguish and thus cite it, and we apologize to the author in advance here. This sentence is especially applicable to punctuation marks, because it is simply impossible to determine whether the responsibility lies with the typesetter or the author.

    Finally, a few words that can be said to be tangential or intrinsic. Speaking and writing influence each other. Now, when listening to people speaking at gatherings, many inappropriate word choices and sentence structures seem to be the same as those in current articles, and even more so. After getting used to listening to this kind of speech, it will unconsciously flow from the pen when writing articles. This is really "ear soaking" and "eye dyeing" working together. Therefore, we think that if people who write articles ponder a little more, it will reduce many people's speaking problems; and if people who speak pay a little attention, it will also be helpful for people who are learning to write articles.
            
            Lecture 1: Basic Knowledge of Grammar

    Section 1: Explaining "Grammar"

    Why study grammar? The purpose of this talk is to help people who are learning to write articles to write them fluently. To write articles fluently, you need some knowledge of grammar, so in the first lecture, we will give a general overview of the content of grammar. Some people will say: "Grammar is a specialized subject. We don't want to be experts. Can you not talk about grammar and just tell us how to write articles fluently?" To answer this question, we need to talk a little further.

    The way people used to learn to write articles was to thoroughly read the articles of the ancients. "Read the Three Hundred Tang Poems thoroughly, and you will be able to write poetry even if you don't know how," this sentence is applicable to learning poetry, and it is also applicable to learning to write articles. Practice makes perfect, and this method does have some effect. But now the learning conditions are different, and this old method is no longer suitable, or at least not completely suitable. How are the learning conditions different? First, in the past, learning to write articles was a matter for a few people, and these few people did not have to learn anything else. They could spend ten or twenty years on this one thing; now everyone has to learn to write articles, and there are many other things to learn, and no one can spend too much time on this one thing. The method of thoroughly reading hundreds of articles is difficult to do. Second, in the past, people read classical works, which were abundant, with classics, history, philosophy, and collections lined up on shelves; even if they were simple, there was still a "Guguan Ancient Prose Anthology"; moreover, only these books were read, and they would not come into contact with incoherent articles (in the era of woodblock printing, incoherent articles had little chance of being engraved). Now it is different. On the one hand, there are not many generally recognized classical works, and they are not complete; on the other hand, people read a lot of things every day, such as books, newspapers, and magazines, and these are often mixed with flaws, making it difficult for people to have a correct understanding of the good and bad of articles and the correctness and errors of sentences. Under these circumstances, the old method of "thoroughly reading the Three Hundred Tang Poems" is naturally difficult to apply. Under these circumstances, the first thing to do is to develop the ability to distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong, so that when reading, you can judge which parts of other people's articles can be learned, and when writing, you can review which parts of your own articles should be revised. This requires some knowledge of grammar and rhetoric, and of these two, you should start with grammar first.

    To talk about grammar, you cannot do without some terminology. Terminology is what most people hate, but in fact it is indispensable. For example, we all want to be healthy and not get sick; for this purpose, we study physiology and nutrition. But to talk about physiology, the first step is to know the names of the various parts inside the body; to talk about nutrition, the first step is to know the names of the various components inside food. It is the same with talking about grammar. If you don't use a single term, many things have to be said very clumsily, and many things simply cannot be explained clearly. Here is a sentence:

    "Malik mentioned that Austin expressed surprise at what Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese government would consider any decision made by the Security Council regarding the Chinese accusation case without the participation of representatives of the Chinese people to be illegal." (News) This sentence has grammatical errors. If you use "any decision" as the subject of "is," then "made by the Security Council..." is an attributive, so you cannot put an "if" in it ("if" connects clauses); if you treat "the Security Council if...makes...any decision" as a clause, then "any decision" is the object of "makes," so you cannot add the word "的" in the middle ("的" connects attributives). By saying this, its problem is pointed out. But if you are not allowed to use the names "subject," "object," "attributive," and "clause" (their meanings will be explained separately below), it is very difficult to explain clearly. So we ask readers to be patient, remember these not-so-many terms, and understand their meanings.

    "Grammar" and "Writing Method." We guess that readers already have a question in their minds: you usually hear people say "writing method," but here you are talking about "grammar," is this actually the same thing, or are they two different things? If they are two different things, how are they distinguished? Our answer is: they are the same thing. You may ask: why are there two names? This is because in China, writing and speaking have been separated since ancient times, and everyone feels that only writing needs to be careful about how to do it well, and speaking can be casual. When the study of grammar was introduced from foreign countries, everyone called it "writing method." Now we know that writing and speaking are the same thing, and speaking in particular is fundamental. Therefore, instead of calling it "writing method," it is better to call it "grammar."

    Some people will say: I originally thought that writing and speaking were different, so I had to learn "writing method." Since writing and speaking are the same thing, don't I already know how to speak? I just write articles the way I speak, so why do I need to learn grammar? This statement is basically correct, but not completely correct. It is true that grammar is nothing more than some guidelines summarized from speaking. But these are common guidelines summarized from everyone's speaking. You, me, anyone, when speaking without paying attention, inevitably violates these guidelines. Therefore, even when it comes to speaking, grammar is still worth learning. Furthermore, when it comes to writing articles, the written articles should be pronounceable, which is a principle that should be valued; many articles cannot be read aloud smoothly, which is not right. But there is still a slight difference between these two things. In our daily speech, we mostly use simple sentences, which are often incomplete and repetitive, and do not need to be organized much; while articles, especially argumentative articles, need to express more complex meanings in a more economical way, and the organization of sentences becomes more complex accordingly. In this process from simple to complex, it is easy to make mistakes. Therefore, writing articles requires more grammar than speaking.

    What is grammar? The scope of grammar is very clear. Europeans talk about their grammar, which generally includes two parts: the morphological changes of words and the methods of making sentences. Chinese words do not have morphological changes, so Chinese grammar only has sentence-making methods. To further divide it, it can also be divided into two parts: sentence structure and the use of function words, but these two parts cannot be completely separated, because some function words are related to sentence structure.

    What grammar is not. But in the minds of most people, the scope of "writing method" is very broad, almost all-encompassing. To give everyone a clearer concept of grammar, we will say again what grammar is not. First, grammar is not philology, regardless of typos, wrong characters, and ancient characters, simplified characters. Second, grammar is not rhetoric. It only cares about the use of function words. It does not care whether words with real meanings are used correctly, such as the "drink" in "drink rice." It only cares whether the structure of the sentence is correct, as for whether the sentence is clever or clumsy, concise or verbose, it does not care. For example, "For imperialism, we have the need to overthrow it," this is not clever in rhetoric (not as good as "Imperialism, we must overthrow it"), but it cannot be said that there is anything wrong with it in grammar. Third, grammar is not logic, although in practice it is inseparable from logic. For example, "Learning has the distinction between attitude and method," the structure of the sentence is completely correct, but it does not make sense in terms of principles, which is illogical (equivalent to saying "Writing has the distinction between pen and paper"). When we write articles, we must pay attention to grammar, and we must also pay attention to rhetoric and logic. As for writing the characters correctly, that goes without saying.

                         (End of this section, incomplete article)
    [Author's Note] This is a general talk, and the speaking should not be too rambling, and the method of footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore, why this name is used instead of that name, why this statement is used instead of that statement, and even why some issues are not discussed in depth, or even put aside—many things that should be explained can only be said in one or two sentences in this article, and those that are more specialized are all omitted, so as not to disturb people's minds. Experts and scholars must have very valuable opinions on these places, and we sincerely hope that they will give us advice so that we can refer to these opinions to revise.

　　语法、修辞讲话
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    编者按：很多读者来信要求我们发表有系统地介绍语法和修辞的常识，帮助他们学习写作。为了满足读者中的这种要求，我们约请了清华大学的吕叔湘、朱德熙两先生编写《语法、修辞讲话》一稿，从今天起开始连载，每周刊登两次。
    关于我国语法学的理论和术语用法，关于词的分类法，关于词句结构的分析法，在我国语法和修辞学者中，还有各种不同的意见。吕、朱两先生所写的《语法、修辞讲话》代表着这些意见中的一种。我们认为读者可以按照这个讲话所阐明的一些基本规则去学习语文的知识。但是，这并不是说，这个讲话就是关于我国语法学和修辞学的定论。我们希望全国语法学者、修辞学者和语文教育工作者们讨论这篇讲话所涉及的许多问题，并提出修改意见，以便原作者能在把这篇讲话印成单行本以前参考修改。
       引言
    这个讲话共分六讲：（１）语法的基本知识，（２）词汇，（３）虚字，（４）结构，（５）表达，（６）标点。第一讲是个序论，以后几讲分几个方面进一步讨论。第一讲专为初学者说，已经有点语法知识的读者可以不看。可是也不妨看看，因为里面用的术语以及它们的意义也许跟他原来所了解的有点不同。并不是我们故意要立异，只是因为语法学者中间还缺少一个“共同纲领”，我们不得不在这里头有所取舍。这个讲话的大纲是经过几度修改的。最初打算只讲语法。后来感觉目前写作中的许多问题都是修辞上的问题，决定在语法之后附带讲点修辞。等到安排材料的时候，又发现这样一个次序，先后难易之间不很妥当，才决定把这两部分参合起来，定为六讲，如上面所记目次。但是修辞部分还是只以消极方面为主，我们的修养限制我们在积极方面多所陈说。和语法放在一块儿讲，恐怕也以有这样一个界限为宜。
    要让这个讲话联系实际，就免不了有所批评，有所批评就得有个标准。可是我们的语言正处在一个变动的阶段，知识分子的语言变动得快一点，多一点，工农大众的语言变动得慢一点，少一点，因此显得很分歧，很不容易定出一个标准。可是标准还是非有一个不可的。我们固然不应该也不可能采取深闭固拒的国粹主义的态度；可是我们也不能让盲目欧化或一味自我作古的人牵着我们的鼻子走。一般地说，我们应该拿现代汉语的语法规律做基础，适当地采取外国语的语法规律，用来增加我们语言的严密性。文言成分，在用汉字写文章的今天，固然还不容易完全避免，而且有时对于现代语的表现力也还有点贡献。但是这里也是很容易出偏差的；除了应用文言本身的规律来批判，还要考虑它跟整个语句调和不调和。我们的评论竭力求其不偏不倚，不武断；甚至有些地方只是提出问题，不下断语，让大伙儿来讨论，来解决。即使这样，恐怕还是难符合每个人的意思：也许有人以为太苛刻，也许有人以为还不够严格。我们欢迎读者指教。
    因为这个讲话侧重在应用方面，所引的例子，错误的或有问题的要比正确的多得多，竟可以说是不成比例。这是因为表达一个意思，正确的格式屈指可数，而错误可以“百出”。比如说，一般句子都有主语，主语都和谓语配合，这是几句话就能说完，几个例子就能证明的，可是在这上头出毛病的很多，就不能不多举些例子。但是这样一来，很容易使初学的人畏首畏尾，提起笔来不敢写下去。这是不必的。只要写的时候留意一点，写了之后再检点一下，自然能减少错误。久而久之，成了习惯，也就不觉得拘束了。
    还可能有一种和这个正相反的反应。看了我们的讲话之后，发现有些名家的文章里偶然也有类似这里所指摘的情形，于是就认为这些规律都是庸人自扰，没有理会的必要。这种想法也是错误的。古今中外的名作家，文章里有小毛病的，不乏其例。他们能够成为名作家总有可以叫人佩服的东西，有了这个东西，小小失于检点是不必太计较的，这就是古人所说“不以一眚掩大德”。我们要学习的是他们的“大德”，不是他们的“一眚”。初学的人是不能拿名家的败笔来做自己的借口的。
    我们的例句的来源，有一般书籍，有教科书，有报纸，有期刊，有文件，有文稿，有通讯，有大、中学生的习作；我们没有详细注明出处，只用“书”“教”“报”“期”“件”“稿”“信”“作”这些字标出来源的类别。所以采取这样的办法，一方面固然是为了省点篇幅，更重要的还是因为出版的书刊无穷，我们的见闻有限，要是注出书刊的名称，可能造成一种错误的印象，以为只有这些书刊的毛病最多，而实际上这些书刊也许还是水准较高的。这是指错误和有问题的方面。正确的例句，有些是从现成的文章里引来的，都只注作者，不记篇名；引文较多的作者，就只注个姓（如“毛”代表毛主席，“鲁”代表鲁迅）。有些是极普通的格式，没有引证的必要，就自己拟一句，不注什么。
    引来的文句，凡是不太长的，都引全句。但为篇幅所限，也为了不分散读者的注意力，有时候不得不删去或前或后的一部分；除非有必要，都没用“……”号。现在的文章里，句子都很长，往往可以分成好几句，我们节取的大率都是可以独立的。其次，一个句子往往同时有几个地方出问题，我们不得不挑出一个来归在某一类问题里讨论，可是也许会使读者误会这个句子的其他部分没有问题。我们的办法是：书刊里的例句一概加括号作附带说明；文稿和习作就把无关紧要的错误改正，留主要的一个讨论。
    现在书刊的校对工作还不够认真，特别是报纸（照我们的经验，人民日报是例外）；因此不免有些语句不是作者原来的模样。遇到这种疑似的情形，我们宁可不用那一句；难免还有失于鉴别因而引上去的，预先在这里向作者道歉。这句话特别适用于标点符号，因为简直无法决定责任在排字工友还是在作者。
    最后，说几句可以说是题外也可以算是题内的话。说话和写文章是互相影响的。现在听人在集会里讲话，许多遣词造句欠妥的地方好像都跟时下文章相同，甚至变本加厉。听惯了这种话，写文章的时候也会不知不觉的在笔下流露。这真是“耳濡”和“目染”交相为用了。因此，我们想，写文章的人多推敲推敲，会减少许多人说话的毛病；而说话的人稍为留心一点，对于学着写文章的人也会有点好处。
            第一讲  语法的基本知识
    第一段  说明“语法”
    为什么要学习语法。这个讲话的目的是帮助学习写文章的人把文章写通顺。要把文章写通顺，需要有些关于语法的知识，所以先在第一讲里把语法的内容说一个大概。有人会说：“语法是一种专门的学问，我们不想当专家，你能不能不讲语法，只告诉我们怎样把文章写通顺呢？”要回答这个问题，话就得稍为说得远一点。
    早先的人学写文章的办法是熟读古人的文章。“熟读唐诗三百首，不会吟诗也会吟，”这句话学诗的适用，学文章的也适用。熟能生巧，这个方法的确也有点效验。但是现在学习的条件不同了，这个老办法就不适用了，至少是不完全适用了。学习条件怎么不同呢？第一，从前学写文章是少数人的事情，而且这少数人也不必学别的，可以在这一件事情上花上十年二十年的功夫；现在人人都要学会写文章，而且还有许多别的东西要学习，谁也不能在这一件事情上花费太多的时间，熟读几百篇文章的办法就难于办到了。第二，从前人读的都是经典著作，广博一点，经、史、子、集可以琳琅满架，简陋一点，也还有一部《古文观止》；而且阅读的只有这些书，不大会接触到不通顺的文章（在雕板印书的时代，不通的文章是不大有机会刻出来的）。现在就不然了。一方面，公认的经典著作还不多，方面也不全；另一方面，每天看书、看报、看杂志，看的东西很多，而这里面往往瑕瑜互见，扑朔迷离，叫人对于文章的好和坏、语句的正和误，不容易有正确的认识。在这种情况之下，“熟读唐诗三百首”的老办法自然就难于适用了。在这种情况之下，首先得养成一种鉴别好和坏、正和误的能力，然后阅读的时候才能判断别人的文章哪些地方可以取法，写作的时候才能检点自己的文章哪些地方应该修正。这就不得不有点语法和修辞学的知识，而这两者之中，又应该先从语法入手。
    要讲语法，就离不开一些术语。术语是一般人最讨厌的，可是事实上少它不了。比如说，我们谁都愿意身体健康，不生毛病；为了这个目的，我们学习生理学和营养学。可是要讲生理学，第一步就得知道身体里面各部分的名称；要讲营养学，第一步就得知道食物里面各种成分的名称。讲语法也是如此。要是一个术语也不用，有许多事情要说的很噜苏，有许多事情简直说不明白。这里有一个句子：
    马立克提到，奥斯汀对周恩来所说中国人民政府将认为安理会如果在没有中国人民的代表参加之下通过的有关中国控诉案的任何决定都将是非法的一点表示惊奇。（报）这个句子在语法上有毛病。如果用“任何决定”做“是”的主语，那末“安理会……通过的”是附加语，就不能在里面安上个“如果”（“如果”是连接分句的）；如果把“安理会如果……通过……任何决定”作为一个分句，那末“任何决定”是“通过”的宾语，中间就不能加上个“的”字（“的”字是连接附加语的）。这样一说，就把它的毛病指出来了。但是如果不许用“主语”“宾语”“附加语”“分句”这些名称（它们的意义底下要分别说明），就很不容易说明白。所以我们要请求读者耐烦点，把这数目并不很多的术语记住，并且把它们的意思弄清楚。
    “语法”和“文法”。我们猜想，读者脑子里已经有一个疑问：平常老听见人家说“文法”，你这儿又讲什么“语法”，这到底是一个东西呀，还是两个东西呢？要是两个东西，那又怎么分别呢？我们的回答是：是一个东西。你要问：为什么又有两个名字呢？这是因为中国自古以来文章跟说话分了家，大家觉得只有文章要讲究怎么做得好，说话是可以马马虎虎的。语法这门学问从外国传进来的时候，大家就管它叫“文法”。现在知道写文章跟说话本是一回事，内中说话尤其是根本。因此，与其管它叫“文法”，就不如管它叫“语法”了。
    又会有人说：原先以为写文章跟说话不同，所以要学习“文法”。既然写文章跟说话是一回事，难道我还不会说话吗？我就照说话的样子写文章，又何必学习什么语法呢？这个话基本上是对的，可是不完全对。不错，语法无非是从说话里面归纳出来的一些纲领。可是这是从大伙儿的说话里面归纳出来的共同纲领，你，我，任何一个人，说话不留心的时候都难免有违背这些纲领的地方。所以，就拿说话来说，语法也还是值得学习的。再拿写文章来说，写出来的文章该说得出口，这是一个应该重视的原则；许多文章读起来不能上口，这是不对的。可是这两件事情中间还是有点差别。我们日常说话，大率只用些简单的语句，常常是不完全的和重复的，不大需要组织；而文章，尤其说理的文章，要用比较经济的方法表达比较复杂的意思，语句的组织也就跟着复杂起来。在这由简单到复杂的过程中，就容易犯错误。所以写文章比说话更需要讲语法。
    语法是什么。语法的范围是很明确的。欧洲人讲他们的语法，大率包括两个部分：词的形态变化和造句的方法。汉语的词是没有形态变化的，所以汉语的语法只有造句法这一个部分。要再分，也可以分成句子的结构和虚字的用法这两部分，不过这两部分不能完全分开，因为有些虚字是和句子结构有关系的。
    语法不是什么。可是在一般人心目中，“文法”的范围非常广大，几乎无所不包。为了让大家对于语法有一个更清楚的概念，我们再说一说语法不是什么。第一，语法不是文字学，不管白字、别字、以及古体字、简笔字这些个。第二，语法不是修辞学。它只管虚字的用法，一般有实在意义的词儿用得对不对，例如“喝饭”的“喝”，它是不管的。它只管句子的结构对不对，至于句子的灵巧或笨拙，干脆或噜苏，它也不管的。例如“对于帝国主义，我们有予以打倒的必要”，这在修辞学上是不高明的（不如“帝国主义，我们一定要打倒它”），可是在语法上不能说是有什么毛病。第三，语法不是逻辑，虽然实际上离不开逻辑。例如“学习有态度与方法之分”，句子的结构是完全正确的，只是事理上讲不通，就是不合逻辑（等于说“写字有笔和纸之分”）。我们写文章，不能不讲语法，也不能不注意修辞和逻辑。至于字要写得对，那是更不用说了。          
                         （本段完，全文未完）
    【作者附启】这是一般性的讲话，说话不能太支蔓，附注的方式最好能够避免。因此，为什么采用这个名称而不采用那个名称，为什么采用这种说法而不采用那种说法，乃至为什么有些问题不去深入讨论，甚至撇开不谈——许多应该说明的话都只能拣要紧的在本文里说一两句，稍为专门点的就都省掉了，免得徒乱人意。这些地方，专家学者一定有很可宝贵的意见，我们诚恳地盼望他们指教，使我们能参考这些意见来修订。
