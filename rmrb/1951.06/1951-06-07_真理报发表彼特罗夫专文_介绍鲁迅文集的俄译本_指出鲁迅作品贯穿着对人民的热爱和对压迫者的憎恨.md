Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd (TASS): The Russian translation of Lu Xun's collection of short stories and essays has recently been published in the Soviet Union. *Pravda* published an article by Petrov to introduce and comment on it. Petrov said: Lu Xun is the founder of modern Chinese literature. He was the first Chinese writer to make peasants the protagonists of his works. Lu Xun's writings demonstrate his true humanism and his deep sympathy for the oppressed people. His realistic short stories are permeated with love for the people and hatred for the oppressors. These works tell us that Lu Xun was a great and observant writer who brilliantly combined the profundity of his works with a high degree of artistic form. Lu Xun is praised as the "Gorky of China," and it is entirely appropriate to compare him with the founder of socialist realist literature. Lu Xun foresaw the end of the old society and the bright future of the people as masters of their own destiny even when he was still living in the old society. Lu Xun's humanism is extremely close to Gorky's humanism. Petrov also said: Lu Xun learned the realistic creative methods and artistic techniques from the great Russian classical literature and Soviet literature, and he was also an enthusiastic promoter and translator of Soviet literature. He loved Soviet literature and called on young Chinese writers to study the lofty ideas and artistic techniques of Soviet literature. Petrov finally suggested that the Soviet State Literature Publishing House publish a selection of Lu Xun's works so that Soviet readers could further understand Lu Xun - a great realist writer, an ardent patriot, and a tenacious fighter for the freedom and happiness of the Chinese people.

　　真理报发表彼特罗夫专文
    介绍鲁迅文集的俄译本   
    指出鲁迅作品贯穿着对人民的热爱和对压迫者的憎恨
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：苏联最近出版了鲁迅的短篇小说和论文集的俄译本。真理报特发表了彼特罗夫的文章加以评介。彼特罗夫说：鲁迅是现代中国文学的创立者。他是把农民作为自己作品的主人公的第一个中国作家。鲁迅的著作表现了他的真正的人道主义，和他对被压迫人民的深切同情。他的现实主义的短篇小说中贯穿着对人民的热爱和对压迫者的憎恨。这些作品告诉我们：鲁迅是一位伟大的、善于观察的作家，他把作品的深刻性和高度的艺术形式光辉地结合起来。鲁迅被誉为“中国的高尔基”，把他和社会主义的现实主义文学的创立者相提并论是完全应当的。鲁迅还生活在旧社会的时候就预见了旧社会的末日和人民做主人的光辉未来。鲁迅的人道主义和高尔基的人道主义极为相近。彼特罗夫又说：鲁迅从伟大的俄国古典文学和苏联文学中学习了现实主义的创作方法和艺术技巧，他又是苏联文学的热情宣传者和翻译者。他爱苏联的文学，而且号召中国的青年作家研究苏联文学的崇高思想和艺术技巧。彼特罗夫最后建议苏联国家文学出版局出版鲁迅选集，使苏联读者进一步了解鲁迅——伟大的现实主义作家，热情的爱国者，为中国人民的自由幸福而斗争的顽强战士。
