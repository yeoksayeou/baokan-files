On the Popularization of Provincial Newspapers

　　Among the provincial newspapers nationwide, apart from those in the Northeast, which have made some efforts and achieved some results in popularization, the provincial newspapers in other parts of the country are generally not popular, or even very unpopular. This is a major shortcoming in the current newspaper work. Since the spring of this year, this issue has begun to attract attention in various regions. The Northwest Region convened a newspaper work conference in January this year, which fundamentally resolved this problem and implemented some important reforms (see Issue 16 of this publication). Some provincial newspapers in North China, Central South, and East China have also successively carried out comprehensive and partial popularization reforms, and some have made significant progress.

　　Among the several newspapers in North China, Central South, and East China that have begun popularization reforms, there are roughly two different situations. One is that comprehensive reforms have already begun, such as the Chahar Daily. Since June 1st, the Chahar Daily has made great improvements in both content and form: news and commentary are generally written in colloquial language; some Xinhua News Agency dispatches are appropriately rewritten before publication; and the columns on each page are basically fixed. To enable the editorial staff to carry out popularization work better, the Chahar Daily ceases publication on Sundays, and Monday's newspaper is reduced to half a sheet. Judging from the readers' letters published in the newspaper, the masses welcome such reforms. In addition, the Hebei Daily also put forward a preliminary plan for implementing popularization in mid-April, with some regulations on the standards, content, and form of popularization. The other is that partial popularization reforms have been implemented, with the New Hunan Daily being a better example. In addition to paying attention to writing general articles in a more popular style and valuing news and opinions written by workers and peasants, the New Hunan Daily has also added some columns with popular content to meet the requirements of various groups of people. In addition, the Henan Daily, Zhejiang Daily, and Southern Jiangsu Daily have also made some preliminary improvements in this regard.

　　Doing so is very necessary. All newspapers should strive for popularization. Of course, it would be incorrect to turn all newspapers into newspapers specifically for readers with lower cultural levels, or to turn any regional provincial newspaper into a farmers' newspaper, given the varying levels of education among the masses in different regions. However, this does not preclude the principle that all newspapers should be popularized.

　　The fundamental issue of popularization is the issue of content, not just form. Newspapers that have already undergone popularization reforms have generally paid attention to this principle. The method advocated by the newspapers in North China of using "living people, living events, and living principles" to strengthen the mass character of newspaper content is correct. The Chahar Daily has made very good efforts in this regard. For example, the production increase and donation plan of a workers' team and a village published on the front page on June 12th is specific and practical in content, making it easy for various regions to learn and promote; the rural column on the second page on June 8th used the achievements of several mutual aid teams to compare with the production of individual farmers, illustrating the benefits of "organizing." This kind of propaganda with "living people, living events, and living principles" is easily accepted by readers.

　　Where do the materials of "living people, living events, and living principles" come from? From the masses. In order to obtain such materials, it is first necessary to strengthen the mass work of the newspaper and handle the contributions and letters from worker-peasant correspondents and general readers conscientiously and responsibly. The situations and opinions reflected by worker-peasant correspondents and other active elements among the masses are the result of their actual feelings and genuine first-hand experience, and therefore are often truly urgent and instructive. Concentrating these materials and opinions well, sorting them out, and then implementing them among the masses, their effect is often much greater than the materials compiled in the editorial department. For example, in May this year, a summer famine occurred in Qiyang County, Hunan. Liu Zhengping, a farmer from Yishan Township in the county, promptly reported the situation to the newspaper and put forward specific suggestions for production to overcome the famine. Cadres of the Yiyang Special District Production Inspection Team reported to the newspaper the situation of water accumulation in the Dongting Lake coastal area and suggested that the leading organs in the coastal areas immediately lead the masses to vigorously drain the water. Many similar examples have proven that the contributions and letters from workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres often reflect the main problems in the current life and production of the masses, and these problems are sometimes difficult for the leading organs and newspapers to accurately understand. The New Hunan Daily valued these materials and published them in the most prominent positions, and some were explained with editorials, which not only guided the actual work, but also encouraged the enthusiasm of the people. If the newspaper is truly full of the voices of the masses, reflects various actual situations among the masses, and can give the masses regular guidance, it will surely be understood and loved by the masses.

　　The popular propaganda of current events and the popular explanation of policies are important parts of popularization work. The Chahar Daily, Hebei Daily, Henan Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Southern Jiangsu Daily, etc., have all paid attention to publishing supplementary materials to help the masses read newspapers, such as policy and terminology explanations, current affairs talks, propaganda material for propagandists, etc. The Zhejiang Daily regularly has two columns in the current affairs section, "The Powerful and Developing Peace and Democracy Camp" and "The Fragile and Declining Imperialist Camp," which summarize Xinhua News Agency's dispatches and other materials and use comparison methods to illustrate the completely different trends of the two camps. These materials are welcomed by readers. The Henan Daily summarized the opinions put forward by readers to the newspaper in hundreds of letters on the occasion of the second anniversary of its founding on June 1st, among which it was mentioned: "They welcomed the popular and short 'Current Affairs Radio Station' and 'Propagandist Speech Material' published by the newspaper in the past and asked them to become regular fixed columns."

　　Adopting forms that are liked and welcomed by the masses is an important method for the masses to grasp the truth. In this regard, there are still great shortcomings in newspapers in various regions. The phenomena of incorrect writing style and chaotic language are very serious. Some newspapers that have carried out popularization reforms lack a correct understanding of popularization, making popularization in fact become vulgarization, adopting popular vocabulary without selection, and there is a tendency to abuse dialects. This tendency is not good. Lenin pointed out: "A good newspaper must be popularized and ideologically close to millions of people, but never degenerate into vulgarity. It is not to cater to backward readers, but to steadily and gradually improve the progressiveness of readers" (quoted from "Cultural and Educational Reference Materials" Volume 8, page 57). Ostrovsky, in his article "Striving for the Purity of Language" (see "Literary Gazette" Volume 3, Issue 12), gave us even better and clearer examples. He said that Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection" depicts the prisons of Tsarist Russia and all its darkness and ugliness, and describes prostitutes and thieves - without abuse, but it is well described. He said that he did not believe that some authors who like to use vulgar language, such as Shefurina and Gladkov, would have the courage to repeat the words of some of the characters they wrote on the podium of the Party Congress. Lenin's instructions and the facts cited by Ostrovsky are worthy of our good study.

　　The popularization reform of provincial newspapers is a very important task, and all doubts and all resistant emotions must be overcome, and it must be resolutely implemented. Only in this way can our newspapers better connect with the masses and become a truly powerful weapon for guiding work and educating the masses.

### 关于省级报纸的通俗化

　　关于省级报纸的通俗化
    在全国省级报纸中，除东北各省报纸在通俗化方面曾作了一些努力并已经有了一些成绩以外，关内各地的省级报纸一般地是不通俗甚至很不通俗的，这是目前报纸工作中的一个很大的缺点。今春以后，这个问题已开始引起各地的重视，西北区已于今年一月召开了西北地区报纸工作会议，基本上解决了这个问题，并实行了一些重要的改革（见本刊第十六号）。华北、中南、华东各地有些省报也已先后进行了全面的和部分的通俗化改革，有的并已有了较大的进步。
    在华北、中南、华东各地已开始进行通俗化改革的几种报纸中，大体上存在着两种不同的情况。一种是已经开始进行了全面改革的，如察哈尔日报。从六月一日起，察哈尔日报在内容和形式上都有了很大的改进：新闻及评论文字大体上口语化了，新华社的一部分电讯稿在发表时都经过了适当的改写，各版的栏目基本上固定了。为了使编写人员能较好地进行通俗化工作，察哈尔日报每星期日休刊一天，星期一的报纸改出半张。从报纸上发表的读者来信看，群众对这样的改革是表示欢迎的。此外，河北日报也在四月中提出了实行通俗化的初步计划，关于通俗化的标准、内容、形式等，都有了一些规定。另一种是实行了部分的通俗化改革的，新湖南报是一个较好的例子。新湖南报除了注意把一般稿件写得比较通俗，重视工农群众写来的新闻和意见之外，并增辟了一些内容通俗的栏目，以适应各种群众的要求。此外，河南日报、浙江日报、苏南日报，也在这方面作了一些初步的改进。
    这样做是非常必要的。一切报纸都应该向通俗化努力。当然，由于各地区群众的文化水平高低不一，把一切报纸都办成专供文化水平较低的读者阅读的报纸或把任何地区的省报都办成农民报自然是不对的。但是这并不妨碍一切报纸都应该通俗化这一条原则。
    通俗化的根本问题是内容问题，而不只是形式问题。已经进行了通俗化改革的报纸一般地已经注意了这个原则。华北各报提倡利用“活人活事活道理”以加强报纸内容的群众性的办法是正确的。察哈尔日报在这方面作了很好的努力。例如六月十二日第一版上所发表的一个工人小组和一个村的增产捐献计划，内容具体而切实，便于各地学习推广；六月八日第二版农村栏用几个互助组的成绩与单干户生产对比，说明了“组织起来”的好处。这种“活人活事活道理”的宣传是容易为读者所接受的。
    “活人活事活道理”的材料从那里来？从群众中来。为要获得这种材料，首先必须加强报纸的群众工作，认真负责地处理工农通讯员和一般读者的来稿来信。工农通讯员和其他群众中的积极分子反映的情况和意见是他们实际感受的结果，是真正的切身经验，因而常常会是真正迫切的和有指导意义的。把这些材料和意见好好的集中起来，加以整理，再贯彻到群众中去，其作用往往比坐在编辑部编写出来的材料大得多。例如今年五月间，湖南祁阳县发生夏荒，该县嶷山乡农民刘正平及时向报纸反映了情况，提出生产度荒的具体意见；益阳专区生产检查队干部向报纸反映了洞庭湖滨湖地区积水的情况，建议滨湖各地领导机关立即领导群众大力排除积水，类此的许多事例都证明了工农群众和基层干部的来稿来信中常反映了当前群众生活和生产中的主要问题，这些问题有时甚至是领导机关和报纸无法确实了解的。新湖南报重视了这些材料，把它们发表在最显著的地位，有些并写社论加以说明，这样就不仅指导了实际工作，而且鼓舞了人民群众的积极性。报纸如果真正充满了群众的声音，反映了群众中的各种实际情况，并能给群众以经常的指导，就一定会为群众所理解所爱读。
    关于时事的通俗宣传和政策的通俗解释是通俗化工作中的重要部分。察哈尔日报、河北日报、河南日报、浙江日报、苏南日报等，都注意发表帮助群众读报的补充材料，如政策、名词解释，时事讲话，宣传员讲话材料等。浙江日报在时事版中经常有“强大和发展中的和平民主阵营”“脆弱和没落中的帝国主义阵营”两个专栏，综合新华社稿和其他材料，用对比方法说明两个阵营的完全不同的两种趋势。这些材料是为读者所欢迎的。河南日报在六月一日创刊两周年纪念日综合了数百件读者来信中对报纸提出的意见，其中就说到：“他们对本报过去登载的通俗、短小的‘时事广播台’、‘宣传员讲话材料’表示欢迎，要求成为经常的固定专栏”。
    采用为群众所喜闻乐见的形式，是使群众掌握真理的重要方法。在这方面，各地报纸仍旧存在着很大的缺点。文风不正和语言混乱的现象，非常严重。有些进行了通俗化改革的报纸对于通俗化缺乏正确的了解，使通俗化在实际上变成了庸俗化，不加选择地采用流行的语汇，存在滥用方言的倾向。这种倾向是不好的。列宁指出：“好的报纸必须要通俗化，在思想上接近千百万群众，但决不是堕入庸俗。不是迁就落后的读者，而是要稳重地逐渐提高读者的进步性”（转引《文教参考资料》第八辑第五十七页）。奥斯特洛夫斯基在“争取语文的纯洁”（见《文艺报》第三卷十二期）一文中，更为我们举出了很好的鲜明的例子。他说，托尔斯泰的小说《复活》描写了沙皇俄国的监狱及其全部黑暗和丑恶，描写了妓女、窃贼——没有恶骂，然而描写得很好。他说他不相信有些爱用粗话的作者如谢甫林娜和格拉得考夫等会有勇气到党代表大会的讲台上去把自己所写的某些人物所说的话重说一遍。列宁的指示和奥斯特洛夫斯基所举出的事实是值得我们很好地加以研究的。
    省级报纸的通俗化改革是一个很重要的工作，必须克服一切的怀疑和一切抗拒的情绪，坚决贯彻下去。只有这样，才能使我们的报纸更好地联系群众，成为指导工作和教育群众的真正有力的武器。
