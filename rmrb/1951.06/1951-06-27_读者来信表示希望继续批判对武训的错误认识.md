Readers' Letters Express
Hope to Continue Criticizing Erroneous Understanding of Wu Xun

　　Since this newspaper published an editorial on May 20th entitled "The Discussion of the Film 'Wu Xun Zhuan' Should Be Emphasized," it has received a wide response from readers. In addition to various organizations and schools holding forums and discussions, as of June 19th, the newspaper had received a total of 1,279 submissions, including 375 articles and 904 letters.

　　The majority of these submissions agreed with the views presented in the newspaper's editorial, offering extensive criticisms of Wu Xun and the film "Wu Xun Zhuan," as well as the "Wu Xun Paintings," etc. Additionally, 435 readers examined their past erroneous understanding of Wu Xun in connection with their own experiences. Two hundred and twenty-five readers raised opinions regarding Sun Yu, Li Shizhao, and others who had written articles praising Wu Xun, as well as newspapers and periodicals that had published texts praising Wu Xun. Many readers also offered constructive criticisms and suggestions regarding those who did not value this discussion or held incorrect attitudes during the discussion. This newspaper has selected a portion of these submissions for publication on the third page and in the "Readers' Letters" column.

　　Among these submissions, a small portion (totaling more than 50) expressed doubts or disagreements regarding the criticism of Wu Xun. Furthermore, many questions were raised in discussions at various schools (such as the Teachers' University, Tsinghua University, etc.). Many readers argued that this issue must be further investigated in order to achieve a thorough resolution. Analyzing these questions, we can see that the fundamental cause of the divisions is the inconsistency of positions and viewpoints among those participating in the discussion. Therefore, in learning, we believe that the most fundamental issue is to strengthen the education of historical materialism.

　　The questions and opinions in these submissions expressing doubts or disagreements regarding the criticism of Wu Xun can be roughly divided into the following categories:

　　First, the issue of evaluating Wu Xun's school establishment and education in the old society. They do not know that education is only a tool for disseminating ideology and culture, and that whoever holds this tool serves them. Therefore, some readers wrote: "Wu Xun's promotion of feudal culture should be criticized, but the achievement of teaching people to read should also be affirmed." "If Wu Xun's establishment of free schools makes him a criminal, it is equivalent to affirming that we in China did not need to read and write before entering the new society." This is a misinterpretation, failing to analyze what kind of books were read and the effect of reading from a class perspective, and misunderstanding the opposition to Wu Xun-style school establishment as opposition to all culture and education. This is clearly a misunderstanding.

　　Second, the issue of the motive for Wu Xun's "school establishment." Some readers wrote: "If it is said that he was for 'fame,' he was initially humiliated and despised by the landlord class; if it is said that he was for profit, he suffered hardship throughout his life and never enjoyed it." Therefore, these readers believe that Wu Xun's "school establishment" was "for poor children," and his behavior of kowtowing and being humble to the feudal rulers was "understandable." They did not deeply study the true purpose of Wu Xun's school establishment. They do not understand that under the oppression and exploitation of the feudal ruling class, poor children had no clothes or food and could not go to school at all. These letters do not recognize Wu Xun from the perspective of who he served, but only talk about motives abstractly, which is bound to fall into the quagmire of idealism.

　　Third, some readers believe that Wu Xun's spirit of hard work was good, but his path was wrong. "If someone had given him instructions on the revolutionary path at that time and led him, Wu Xun might not have opposed the revolution." This is failing to analyze the problem from a historical perspective and class standpoint. At that time, the broad masses of peasants rose up in revolution, but Wu Xun stood with the landlord class to oppose the revolution. Is this not because his class standpoint was fundamentally reactionary? Since it is admitted that Wu Xun's path was wrong, then any of his efforts become reactionary. The more his "asceticism," the greater his reactionary effect. This is very obvious.

　　Fourth, many letters say that Wu Xun's failure was limited by the "historical conditions" at the time. "Wu Xun only knew how to establish free schools, but did not know what kind of free schools to establish"; "He was illiterate and did not understand the laws of social development"; "He was 'subtly influenced' by the feudal ruling class and 'made a sacrifice'; this responsibility should not be borne by him, but by the feudal ruling class." All these statements are contrary to historicism. When Wu Xun established schools, it was a time of intense peasant revolutionary struggles. If he wanted to revolt, he could have completely joined the revolution. Even when it comes to establishing schools, he could have done so entirely within the revolutionary ranks. But he did not take this path, but went to serve the landlord class. This cannot be defended by saying that it was due to "the subtle influence of the landlord class" or that "he did not understand the laws of social development."

　　In addition, there are issues such as the relationship between reformism and Wu Xun's school establishment, and the attitude towards the discussion of Wu Xun Zhuan, which also need to be further discussed in depth. Through this discussion, we should establish a revolutionary historical materialist viewpoint and improve our political and ideological level.

### 读者来信表示希望继续批判对武训的错误认识

专栏：来信述评

　　读者来信表示
    希望继续批判对武训的错误认识
    本报于五月二十日发表题为“应当重视电影‘武训传’的讨论”的社论以后，广大读者纷纷响应。除各机关学校组织座谈讨论外，给本报的来稿来信，到六月十九日为止，共计一千二百七十九件；其中包括来稿三百七十五件、来信九○四件。
    这些来稿来信，大部分都同意本报社论所提出的观点，对武训及电影《武训传》、《武训画传》等作了广泛的批评，并有四百三十五位读者联系自己检查了过去对武训的错误认识。二百二十五位读者对孙瑜、李士钊及其他曾经写文章歌颂武训的人和刊载过歌颂武训的文字的报刊分别提出意见；对于某些不重视这种讨论或在讨论中抱不正确态度的，许多读者也提出积极性的批评与建议。这些稿件信件本报已选择一部分在第三版及“读者来信”栏发表。
    在这些来稿来信中，仍有一小部分（共计有五十余件）对于关于武训的批评表示怀疑或异议。另外在各学校（如师大、清华等）的讨论中也提出了很多问题。许多读者主张对于这一问题还须继续深入研讨，才能求得彻底解决。根据这些问题分析，我们可以看出：在参加讨论的人们当中，立场观点的不一致，是造成分歧的根本原因。因此，在学习中，我们认为最根本的问题是加强历史唯物论的教育。
    这些对于批评武训表示怀疑或异议的来稿来信中的问题和意见，大约可分为如下几类：
    第一，对武训兴学与旧社会中教育的估价问题。他们不知道教育只是一种传播思想文化的工具，这种工具操在谁的手里就为谁服务，因而有的读者来信说：“武训宣传封建文化这一面应该批判，但教人识字的成绩也应该肯定。”“武训办义学如果成了罪人，就等于肯定了我们中国没有走入新社会时是不需要读书识字的。”这都是没有以阶级观点分析读什么书以及读书的效果，而误解反对武训式的兴学为反对一切文化教育，这显然是认识错了的。
    第二，关于武训“兴学”的动机问题。有的读者来信说：“如说他是为‘名’，他最初是遭到地主阶级欺侮鄙视的；如说他为利，他始终吃苦，没有享受过。”因此，这些读者认为：武训“兴学”是“为了穷孩子”，他向封建统治者磕头下跪卑躬屈膝的行为也“未可厚非”。他们没有深入研究武训兴学的真正目的。他们不了解在封建统治阶级的压迫剥削下，穷孩子无衣无食，根本不能上学。这些来信不从武训究竟为谁服务去认识他，而只抽象地谈动机，势必陷于唯心主义的泥潭。
    第三，有的读者认为：武训刻苦精神是好的，只是他的路走错了。“如果当时有人给指示革命道路，加以领导，武训未必不会革命。”这是没有从历史观点和阶级立场来分析问题的。当时广大农民起来革命，武训却与地主阶级站在一起反对革命，这难道不是因为他的阶级立场根本就是反动的吗？既然承认武训的路走错了，那末，他的任何努力都成为反动的东西。他的“苦行”愈多，他的反动作用就愈大。这是很显然的。
    第四，许多来信说，武训的失败是受当时“历史条件”所限制的。“武训只知办义学，而不知道办怎样的义学”；“他不识字，不理解社会发展的规律”；“他受了封建统治阶级的‘潜移默化’，‘做了牺牲’；这个责任不应由他来负，应由封建统治阶级来负”。这种种说法正是违反历史主义的。当武训兴学时，正是农民革命斗争激烈的时候，如果他要革命他完全可以投向革命。就说兴学吧，他也可以完全在革命队伍里兴学。而他并不走这条路，却去为地主阶级服务。这就不能以“地主阶级的潜移默化”、“他不了解社会发展规律”去为他辩护了。
    此外还有改良主义与武训兴学的关系及对武训传讨论的态度等问题，均有继续深入讨论的必要。我们应通过这一讨论，树立起革命的历史唯物主义的观点，提高政治的思想的水平。
