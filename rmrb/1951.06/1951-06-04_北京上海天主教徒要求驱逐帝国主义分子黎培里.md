Beijing and Shanghai Catholics
Demand Expulsion of Imperialist Element Liberi

Catholics in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as local organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations in Shanghai, have condemned Liberi, a Monaco national and imperialist element in Nanjing, for undermining the Chinese Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement. They unanimously demanded that the government expel him from the country.

The Beijing Catholic Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression issued a statement on May 27, pointing out: When the Nanjing Diocese put forward the patriotic declaration, the imperialist element Liberi dared to openly oppose it, and even publicly issued a letter to the bishops of various districts, attempting to incite "all Catholics" and "the entire clergy" to resist this reform. His purpose is to drag all Catholics into the mire and hinder our reform movement. This clearly exposes the hideous face of imperialism as being hostile to our liberated New China.

The statement continued: Liberi has always been hostile to the broad masses of people in New China. In particular, since the Three-Self Movement has been launched in various places, he has instigated the Shanghai Catholic Central Bureau, which he sponsors, to publish many reactionary pamphlets. At the same time, he sent his henchman Chen Zhemin to bring "The True Meaning of Catholicism," which was printed in Beijing by imperialist elements who were on the same wavelength as him. This series of crimes has caused serious damage to the national Catholic reform movement. Judging from the interconnected relationship of imperialist elements, there must be many imperialist elements who are willing to be accomplices of Liberi, such as Madinao, who regards himself as Liberi's representative, is a living example.

The statement also called on Catholics across the country: In order to reform Chinese Catholicism, we must not tolerate Liberi's imperialist actions. We demand that the government expel him from the country. We must unite more closely, stand firm on the position of our people, eliminate and uproot all imperialist elements hidden in churches across the country, and strive to the end to achieve the Three-Self reform!

The Catholic teachers, students, and staff of Aurora University in Shanghai held a forum on May 28 to discuss the incident of Liberi, a Monaco national and imperialist element in Nanjing, undermining the Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement. Hu Wenyao, the president of the university, Yang Shida, the dean of studies, and more than a dozen students and workers spoke successively, unanimously demanding that Liberi be expelled. In an impassioned atmosphere, the forum passed a letter of condolence to the Catholics in Nanjing and a declaration against the imperialist element Liberi's sabotage of the Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement.

### 北京上海天主教徒要求驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里

　　北京上海天主教徒
    要求驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里
    北京、上海天主教徒以及上海各民主党派地方组织和各人民团体，纷纷谴责南京摩纳哥侨民、帝国主义分子黎培里破坏中国天主教三自革新运动。并一致要求政府将其驱逐出境。
    北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，于五月二十七日发表声明指出：当南京教区提出爱国宣言的同时，帝国主义分子黎培里竟敢公然反对，更公然发出给各区主教的信，妄想煽动天主教的“一切教友”和“全体神职班”来反抗这一革新，他的目的是想把全国教徒拉下泥坑，阻碍我们的革新运动。这就很清楚地暴露了帝国主义与我们解放后的新中国为敌的狰狞面孔。
    声明继称：黎培里对新中国的广大人民一向是敌对的，特别是三自运动在各地展开以来，他嗾使了在上海他主办的天主教教务协进会发布了很多反动的小册子；同时他派了他的爪牙陈哲敏携来“天主教真意义”，通过与他气脉相通的帝国主义分子在北京印发。这一系列的罪行，给了全国天主教革新运动一个严重的破坏。再从帝国主义分子的一脉相通的关系上来看，甘心做黎培里的帮凶的帝国主义分子一定是大有人在，如以黎培里代表自居的马迪懦就是一个活生生的例子。
    声明并向全国教友号召：为了革新中国天主教，我们决不能容忍黎培里的帝国主义的行动，我们要求政府驱逐他出境，我们更要紧密地团结在一起，站稳我们人民的立场，来肃清并拔掉隐藏在全国教会中的一切帝国主义分子，并为实现三自革新奋斗到底！
    上海震旦大学师生员工中的天主教徒于五月二十八日举行座谈会，讨论现在南京的摩纳哥侨民、帝国主义分子黎培里破坏天主教三自革新运动的事件。该校校长胡文耀、教务长杨士达和十多个学生、工友相继发言，一致要求把黎培里驱逐出去。座谈会在激昂的气氛中通过了给南京天主教徒的慰问信和反对帝国主义分子黎培里破坏天主教三自革新运动的宣言。
