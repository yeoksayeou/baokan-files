　　Guo Yucheng Mutual Aid Team's Patriotic Production Increase and Donation Plan
      Liu Xian, Gu Fengli
    The Guo Yucheng Mutual Aid Team in Nanxiaowang Village, Boye County, Hebei Province, has formulated a production increase and donation plan, aiming to donate over 6,400 jin of grain from increased production to the Volunteer Army for the purpose of purchasing airplanes and artillery.

    The Guo Yucheng Mutual Aid Team consists of twenty-one households, with seventy-five male and female members, cultivating 315 mu of land. In March of this year, they formulated a patriotic production plan, challenging the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. Over the past three months, they have continuously studied current affairs and have come to understand that patriotic production increase is an important task in resisting America and aiding Korea, and everyone has become more enthusiastic in production.

    On June 7th, they studied the three patriotic appeals issued by the China Association to Resist America and Aid Korea on June 1st, and learned that the Volunteer Army is stronger than the American soldiers in every aspect except that they don't have enough airplanes and artillery. Everyone is willing to respond to the call, increase production, and support the front lines. However, some people said: "The plan to challenge the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team is enough. Our land yields are much higher than others. It's hard to increase it further." Some people also advocated that there is no need to increase production further, just donate more. Still others felt a little distressed when they heard that the increased production would be donated. Guo Yucheng explained: "The Volunteer Army has to shed blood on the battlefield, and we only need to sweat a little to donate airplanes. Comparing bloodshed and sweating, which is lighter and which is heavier? We can't live with our conscience if we are unwilling to sweat for the country." Later, everyone discussed it in groups and felt that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have led us to live a good life. To preserve our good life, we must donate more airplanes and artillery to support the Volunteer Army and further improve production. Then, everyone checked the production situation this year. This spring, the whole team planted 100 mu of cotton and 195 mu of other crops, applied 302 large carts of manure, and accumulated 197 large carts of fertilizer after spring plowing; the cotton was hoed twice, and the other crops were also hoed once. The crops are growing very well. Because everyone helps each other, and seventeen women participate in field production, the team often saves seven male laborers to engage in sideline production, earning a lot of money. Although last year's crops were flooded and the harvest was poor, this year they added and replaced livestock, bought 5,000 jin of soybean cake, and jointly purchased four waterwheels with the villagers. Now they are starting to harvest wheat and select "72" wheat seeds. The patriotic production plan is being realized step by step.

    How to increase production further? Everyone carefully analyzed the soil quality of each plot, studied the effects of processing and fertilization, carefully estimated the possible increase in yield, and thought of some other methods. Finally, they formulated a patriotic production increase plan to donate airplanes and artillery: (1) Apply 1,800 more jin of fine fertilizer, so that 100 mu of cotton will increase production by 10 jin per mu, with a total increase of 1,000 jin, equivalent to 4,000 jin of grain; 30 mu of millet will increase production by 30 jin per mu, with a total increase of 900 jin; 60 mu of late rice will increase production by 10 jin per mu, with a total increase of 600 jin; the total of these three items is an increase equivalent to 5,500 jin of grain, and 65 percent will be donated, which is 3,575 jin. (2) Increase planting of late rice by 30 mu (with relatively poor soil quality), yielding approximately 3,360 jin, and donate 25 percent, which is 840 jin. (3) Increase planting of one mu of "Resist America, Aid Korea Cabbage," try to plant it well, and plan to produce 10,000 jin, all of which will be donated, equivalent to 2,000 jin of grain. The total increase in production and donation is equivalent to 6,415 jin of grain.

    Then, someone suggested saving money and donating the savings to the Volunteer Army to buy airplanes. Zhong Zhijie said: "For the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, I have quit my decades-long drinking habit!"

    Finally, everyone checked the patriotic covenant and added three articles to the covenant: 1. In order to resist America and aid Korea and support the front lines, we must apply more fertilizer and process more carefully, exceed the production plan, produce patriotic grain, and donate 6,415 jin of grain to purchase airplanes and artillery; 2. Do a good job of farming for the families of martyrs and soldiers; 3. Actively take the lead in paying national taxes.

    According to the new production plan, the yields from their land are one-third higher than usual, but everyone has confidence in completing the plan. The women immediately proposed: "We will take care of the cotton harvesting work!" Some people are already calculating how to accumulate a few more circles of fertilizer. One team member said: "When we hoe the ground, it's like eliminating the American devils. When our backs hurt, we think of the pain the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang gave us, and think that the American devils are planning to invade us again, and our strength comes back. We tell the truth and do practical things. Let's work hard and compare our achievements with everyone in the newspaper and at the labor model conference!"

　　郭玉琛互助组的爱国增产捐献计划
      刘宪　谷凤礼
    河北省博野县南小王村的郭玉琛互助组，订出了增产捐献计划，要从增加生产中捐献六千四百多斤粮食给志愿军做购买飞机大炮之用。
    郭玉琛互助组包括二十一户，男女组员七十五人，耕地三百十五亩。今年三月，他们订出了爱国丰产计划，向李顺达互助组应战。三个月来，他们不断地学习时事，知道了爱国丰产就是抗美援朝的重要工作，大家在生产上更加起劲了。
    六月七号，他们学习了抗美援朝总会在六月一日发出的三项爱国号召，知道了志愿军打仗样样都比美国兵强，就是飞机、大炮还不够多。大家都愿意响应号召，增加生产，支援前线。但也有人说：“和李顺达互助组应战的计划足够了，咱们地里的产量比别人的高多了，再往上长可难说。”也有人主张不必再搞增产，反正多捐点就行。还有人听说要把增产的东西捐出来，有点心痛的样子。郭玉琛解释说：“志愿军在战场上要流血，咱们捐飞机，多流点汗就行了。流血和流汗，比比看，那个轻，那个重呢？为国家连汗也舍不得流，良心上也过不去。”后来大伙又分组讨论了一番，都觉得毛主席、共产党领导咱们过了好日子，要保住自己的好日子，就得多捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军，还得把生产再提高一步。接着，大伙就检查了今年的生产情况。全组今春种了一百亩棉花和一百九十五亩其他庄稼，上了三百零二大车粪，春耕后又积了一百九十七大车肥料；棉花锄过了两遍，别的庄稼也锄了头遍。庄稼都长得非常好。因为大家互助作活，又有十七名妇女参加田间生产，组内经常省下七个男劳动力搞副业，赚了不少钱。虽然去年稼庄被水淹歉收，今年还添、换了牲口，买了五千斤豆饼，又和村里群众合伙添置了四个水车。现在正开始收麦和选“七二”小麦种。爱国丰产计划是一步一步实现了。
    怎样再增加生产呢？大家认真地分析了每块地的土质，研究了加工、施肥的效果，精细地估计了可以增加的产量，另外又想了一些别的办法，终于作出了爱国增产捐献飞机大炮的计划：（一）再多施细肥一千八百斤，使一百亩棉花每亩再增产十斤，共增产一千斤，折谷四千斤；三十亩谷子每亩增产三十斤，共增产九百斤；晚田六十亩每亩增产十斤，共增产六百斤；三项合计共增产折谷五千五百斤，捐献百分之六十五，即三千五百七十五斤。（二）增种晚田三十亩（土质较差），约产三千三百六十斤，捐献百分之二十五，即八百四十斤。（三）增种一亩“抗美援朝白菜”，尽量种好，计划产一万斤，全部捐出，折谷二千斤。总计共增产捐献折谷六千四百十五斤。
    接着，又有人提出要省俭点，节省了钱给志愿军买飞机用。仲志杰说：“我为抗美援朝，把几十年的酒瘾都戒啰！”
    最后，大伙又检查了爱国公约，在公约里添了三条：一、为抗美援朝，支援前线，要更多地施肥、加工，超过丰产计划，生产爱国粮，捐献谷六千四百十五斤购买飞机大炮；二、作好烈属、军属代耕工作；三、积极带头交纳国税。
    根据新的生产计划，他们地里的产量比一般的高出了三分之一，但大家都有完成计划的信心。妇女们当场就提出：“俺们包了收拾棉花的工作！”有的人就在计算着怎样多攒几圈肥料。一位组员说：“咱们耪地锄草，就像铲除美国鬼子一样。腰痛时一想起日本鬼子和国民党给过咱们的痛苦，想起美国鬼子又打算来侵略咱们，咱的劲就又上来了。咱们说实话，办实事。努力干吧，一定要在报纸上，在劳动模范会上，和大伙比比成绩！”
