　　Remembering Two or Three Things About My Father, Qu Qiubai
       Qu Duyi
    On the land of the free motherland, today are growing flowers, and these flowers are watered by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. Among them is also the blood of my father—Qu Qiubai. Seeing these flowers, one cannot help but think of the martyrs who dedicated their entire lives for the people's freedom and happiness yesterday and today, and cannot help but remember my father, although the days I spent with him were very short.

    I remember when I was little, my father was in very poor health, and his face with glasses was always so thin, so pale, so calm. His lung disease, acquired from overwork, often flared up, and he often had fevers and coughed up blood. But I never saw him stop working and studying. He was either giving speeches or talking to people, or he was hunched over his desk writing articles or reading books. From morning till late at night, every day like this. It seemed he didn't know what fatigue was. People who had heard him speak in Moscow said: When Comrade Qiubai gave a speech, he started wearing a coat, then took off his coat, and later even took off his jacket, always speaking with more and more enthusiasm and energy. I think it was this spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people that supported him, giving him infinite strength, enabling him to do much work beneficial to the revolution, and learn much knowledge beneficial to the revolution.

    When I was studying at a Soviet primary school, my father was working day and night under the White Terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was difficult to receive letters from him. Each of his short letters was always filled with a loving father's affection and a good teacher's education. At that time, it was when the Japanese devils were invading the Northeast. He told me in his letters how the Japanese devils were occupying the Northeast and cruelly killing Chinese people and children. He told me to study hard, remember the motherland, and grow up to return to the country to avenge the compatriots who died... and build the motherland as free and happy as the Soviet Union. Once he sent a picture of a zeppelin with a few words written on the back: "Little Duyi, make such zeppelins for China in the future." I think it was this love for the people and descendants of the motherland and hatred for imperialism that made him bravely fire fiercely burning bullets at the enemy's阵地阵地。

    In the summer of 1935, Pravda published a photo of my father and the news of his murder by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. It gave me a great shock at the time. I hated the traitor Chiang Kai-shek for not fighting the Japanese devils but only killing excellent revolutionary fighters. I began to realize that the achievement of the revolution had to be won by bloody struggle. Later, I learned that my father had tasted all kinds of threats from the enemy during his imprisonment and had refused all kinds of temptations from the enemy. The public enemy Chiang Kai-shek could not do anything to him, so he ordered him to be shot. From the photo of him before his martyrdom, I saw his face swollen from the torment, but his expression was still so calm. The clear sound of him singing The Internationale when he was executed seems to still be echoing in my ears. I think, isn't it the appeal of countless such communists and the unity of the people around the Communist Party that achieved the victory of the revolution? I later heard that after killing my father, the enemy also compiled some nihilistic poems, saying that my father wrote them while in prison, wanting to use this to slander him, which is also to slander the Communist Party. My Chinese is very poor, and I don't know what the poems are, but I know that what the people hate is what the enemy loves; what the enemy hates is what the people love. The enemy still wanted to slander him after killing my father, which shows how deeply the enemy hated him and the Communist Party, and shows how deeply the people loved him and the Communist Party. Since the enemy cannot cover up the fact that he sang The Internationale when he bravely gave his life, all the enemy's slanders are as weak and ridiculous as a dragonfly trying to shake a pillar.

    Comrade Shi Lianxing, who plays "Zhao Yiman," talked about my father's situation in the Soviet area after the Central Red Army set out on the Long March when she passed through Moscow at the beginning of the year. At that time, he often told the comrades in the literary and artistic troupe the reasons why the revolution would surely win. In the most difficult times, his spirit was very happy. He personally guided the literary and artistic troupe to collect folk songs and dramas, advocated absorbing folk art into the stage, and painstakingly revised scripts for the literary and artistic troupe. The dramas combined with folk art were greatly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the comrades in the literary and artistic troupe work very enthusiastically. And my father's confidence in the victory of the revolution and his joyful spirit gave them even greater encouragement. This was not long before he was arrested. This fact also refutes those slanderous nihilistic poems.

    My father did not leave a will in words but left a will in the actions of a communist, which is: to love the people, to hate the enemy; to be loyal to the revolution, to be ruthless to the counter-revolution. Later, my mother and I were also captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and imprisoned. In the long years, we always kept his will firmly in mind. When the enemy launched various attacks on us, my father's will burned in me like a fire. As children of the revolutionary ranks, we should raise the banner left by the martyrs even higher!

    Recently, I met the Soviet historian Ehrenburg and the sinologist Guo Zisheng. Ehrenburg said to me: I often remember Comrade Qu Qiubai. He made a great contribution to the development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. I often mention Qu Qiubai's name when I lecture to university students on the history of the Chinese revolution. Guo Zisheng said to me: Your father helped me a lot. I recently read his "Random Talks," which is really well written, but I didn't have the opportunity to get it before. I know very little about my father's contribution to the Chinese revolution, to Sino-Soviet friendship, and the significance of his works. But I know that he was humble and never boasted about his achievements and knowledge. I think this is because he started from serving the people and not for other purposes. Many people know that he met with Lenin and other leaders of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), but he never mentioned these things. Many people know that his Russian was very good, and he could give speeches and write poetry, but he never felt complacent about it and often warned people who were learning Russian that learning Russian required ten to fifteen years of hard work. He was good at writing political and literary articles, but he never despised translation work and often personally translated...

    Many people who knew my father said that it was a pity he died too early. Yes, he was only thirty-six years old when he was killed by the enemy, and he and countless martyrs were destroyed by the enemy in their prime. However, the enemy's brutality could not stop the progress and victory of the revolution. My father died in a year when the revolution suffered setbacks. At that time, there were only tens of thousands of communists, but now there are more than five million. Now the day of judgment for the counter-revolutionaries has arrived. Let us take good care of the flowers watered by the blood of the martyrs.

    Editor's note: Comrade Qu Qiubai was martyred on June 18, 1935.

　　回忆我的父亲瞿秋白的两三件事
       瞿独伊
    在自由祖国的土地上，今天长着一朵朵鲜花，这些鲜花都是无数革命先烈的热血浇灌出来的。其中也有我的父亲——瞿秋白的热血。看到这些鲜花，不能不想到昨天和今天为人民的自由和幸福而献出全部生命的烈士们，不能不记起我的父亲，虽然我和他在一起的日子非常短。
    记得我小的时候，我的父亲身体很坏，带着眼镜的脸孔总是那么瘦削，那么苍白，那么平静。他因劳而得的肺病时常发作，时常发烧吐血。但是我从来没有看见他停止过工作和学习。他要不是做演讲或和人们谈话，就是伏在桌子上写文章或读书。从早上到深夜，天天这样。似乎不知道疲倦是什么东西。在莫斯科听过他的演讲的人说：秋白同志演讲的时候，开始时穿着大衣，后来脱掉大衣，后来连上衣也脱掉，总是越讲越热情越起劲。我想，正是这种一心一意为人民服务的精神支持着他，给他无穷的气力，使他做了许多有益于革命的工作，学了许多有益于革命的知识。
    当我在苏联小学念书的时候，我的父亲在国民党反动派白色恐怖的环境下，日日夜夜地工作着。很困难得到他的信。每次他的简短来信总是充满着慈父的爱和良师的教育，当时正是日本鬼子侵略东北的时候，他在信上告诉我，日本鬼子怎样侵占东北，残杀中国老百姓和儿童。他告诉我要好好学习，记住祖国，长大了回国为死难同胞报仇……把祖国建设得像苏联一样自由和幸福。有一次他寄来了一张飞艇的照片，后面写了几个字：“小独伊，将来为中国制造这样的飞艇”。我想，正是这种对祖国人民和后代的爱，对帝国主义的恨，使他坚强地向敌人阵地发射了火力炽烈的子弹。
    一九三五年夏天，真理报登了我的父亲的照片和他被蒋介石匪帮杀害的消息。当时给了我很大的刺激。我恨蒋介石卖国贼不打日本鬼子，光杀优秀的革命战士。我开始认识到，革命的成就是要用流血斗争来争取的。后来知道，我的父亲在坐牢时期曾尝尽了敌人的种种威胁，拒绝了敌人的种种利诱。人民公敌蒋介石奈何不了他，才下令枪决他，从他殉难前的照片上，我看到他被磨难得发肿的脸孔，但是神气还是那么平静。他就义时高唱国际歌的清晰声音，好像还旋绕在我的耳际。我想，不正是无数这种共产党员的感召和团结全国人民在共产党的周围而取得革命的胜利么？我后来听说，敌人在杀死我的父亲之后，还集什么虚无主义的诗句，说是我的父亲坐牢时写的，想借此来中伤他，也就是中伤共产党。我的中文很差，不知道什么诗句，但是我却知道：人民所仇恨的，是敌人所宠爱的；敌人所仇恨的，是人民所宠爱的。敌人在杀死我的父亲之后，还想中伤他，这正说明敌人仇恨他，仇恨共产党之深，正说明人民爱戴他，爱戴共产党之深。敌人既然无法掩盖他在英勇就义时高唱国际歌的事实，因而敌人的一切中伤都像蜻蜓撼柱一样无力和可笑。
    饰“赵一曼”的石联星同志，年初过莫斯科时，曾谈起在中央红军出发长征后我的父亲留在苏区的情形。当时他常常向文工团同志们讲革命必胜的道理。在最困难时期，他的精神却是很愉快的。他亲自指导文工团收集民间的歌曲和戏剧，提倡把民间艺术吸收到舞台上去，并且不辞辛苦地替文工团改剧本，与民间艺术结合的戏剧，受到工农兵群众的莫大欢迎，使文工团同志干得很起劲。而我的父亲对革命胜利的信心和愉快精神给他们的鼓舞更大。这是他被捕前不久的事。这一事实也反驳了那些中伤的虚无诗句。
    我的父亲没有用话句留下遗嘱，却用共产党员本色的行动留下了遗嘱，这就是：对人民要爱，对敌人要恨；对革命要忠，对反革命要狠。后来我和我的母亲也被蒋介石匪帮抓到牢里。在漫长的岁月中，我们时时紧紧记住他这个遗嘱。当敌人向我们作各种进攻的时候，我的父亲的遗嘱就像一团火燃烧着我。作为革命队伍的儿女，应该更高地举起先烈们留下的旗帜呵！
    最近碰见了苏联历史家爱伦堡和汉学家郭质生。爱伦堡对我说：我常常记起瞿秋白同志，他在发展中苏两国人民的友谊上有很大的贡献，我给大学生讲中国革命史时，常常提到瞿秋白的名字。郭质生对我说：你父亲对我的帮助很大，最近读到了他的《乱弹》，写得真好，可惜以前没有机会得到它。关于我的父亲对于中国革命，对于中苏友谊的贡献，以及他的著作的意义，我知道得很少。但我知道，他是谦虚的，从来不夸耀自己的功绩和学问。我想，这是因为他是从为人民而不为其他目的出发。许多人都知道他曾和列宁和联共的其他领导人见过面，但他从来不提这些。许多人都知道他的俄文很好，能演讲和作诗，但他从来不以此自满，时常告诫学俄文的人说，学俄文要下十年到十五年的苦功。他长于写政治和文艺文章，但他绝不轻视翻译的工作，常常亲自动手翻译……
    许多认识我父亲的人都说，可惜他死得太早了。是的，他被敌人杀死时才三十六岁，他和无数先烈都是在有为之年被敌人摧残了的。然而敌人的残暴阻止不了革命的进展和胜利。我的父亲死在革命受挫折的年份，当时共产党员不过几万人，而现在已超过五百万人了。现在反革命分子受审判的末日到来了。让我们好好地扶植先烈们热血浇灌出来的鲜花。
