　　From Disaster to Prosperity: The Rudong Cotton Region in Northern Jiangsu
       Yu Bozhi
Editor's Note: The fact that cotton farmers in the Rudong reclamation area of northern Jiangsu overcame disasters and moved towards prosperity profoundly illustrates a truth: only in the era of the People's Government is it possible for farmers to overcome natural disasters and gradually move towards prosperity. Under the rule of reactionary governments, farmers only become increasingly impoverished and bankrupt, and if they encounter natural disasters, the consequences are unimaginable. It is hoped that all cotton-growing farmer brothers will recall their experiences in the old society after reading this newsletter, and recall from what time their production income was guaranteed? And further consider: in today's world, when the People's Government calls on cotton farmers to sell or store all their cotton to the state in order to help the country overcome cotton shortages, supply the military and civilians with clothing, and maintain price stability, what attitude should they take towards this call? Should they ignore it? Or should they sell their cotton immediately to help the country overcome its difficulties? We believe that after understanding this truth, the vast majority of cotton farmers will help the country overcome this difficulty.

　　"Last year every family suffered from famine, this year the rice granaries are full." This is what cotton farmers in the Rudong reclamation area of northern Jiangsu, who have undergone land reform, often say these past two years. When I asked cotton farmers why they were living so well now, many cotton farmers replied in unison: "We rely on the leadership of the People's Government, we have divided the land, we have overcome the disasters, we have also established cooperatives, we have changed to growing Daizi cotton, we have harvested good autumn crops, we have bought cheap rice, how can life not be good?"

　　Overcoming Serious Disasters

　　On the twenty-fifth day of the sixth lunar month in the summer of 1949, a typhoon blew for a day and a half, with torrential rain, and it was also high tide. The water in the inland rivers could not flow out, and the water flooded more than two feet deep on the ground, drowning most of the robust cotton seedlings and the corn that was about to be harvested. The houses were also damaged, and some were blown down. Many people had nowhere to live, were very pessimistic, and felt that there was no way to live. At this time, the People's Government, through various meetings, publicized to the masses the principle that "man can conquer nature," and called on Communist Party members and cadres to lead the masses through the famine. Zhu Chengben and thirty-one other party members in Zhendong Township expressed their determination to overcome the famine together in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, proposing that "fleeing the famine is a disgrace," so the morale of the masses gradually stabilized.

　　In winter, the government loaned wheat seeds, enabling everyone to plant wheat. At the end of the year, the government also launched mutual aid and relief, transferring 350 shi of grain. By the spring of last year, the difficulties of the masses reached their peak. Some people found it difficult to even drink a bowl of porridge, and most families lived on bran, alfalfa, vegetables, and radishes. At this time, the government began to call for the establishment of cooperatives. Many people had no money to invest, so the government organized the masses to transport grain to Juegang to earn money to invest. At that time, more than twenty people participated in the cooperative, and the cooperative began to be established. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to develop sideline production, such as fishing, picking firewood, and selling goods. After such multiple methods of production and hard support, they finally overcame the serious famine and survived until the wheat harvest.

　　Good Times After the Harvest

　　This autumn harvest, the pure Daizi cotton planting area of more than 100,000 mu of land in the entire reclamation area harvested 3.6 million jin of ginned cotton, an average yield of more than 30 jin of ginned cotton per mu. None of the cotton farmers have forgotten the benefits given to them by the People's Government: a loan of 210,000 jin of soybean cake, 130,000 jin of barley seed for flower loans, 210,000 jin of rice for weeding loans, 230 sprayers, and 50,000 jin of pesticide powder were loaned out to prevent and control the leaf roller on more than 21,000 mu, in addition to building culverts to eliminate water disasters, so there is today's good times. Now, people can see many newly built houses everywhere. In normal years, except for eating a little rice during festivals, they can only eat corn and buckwheat. This year is very different from previous years, every household is eating rice. Gu Longcai, a poor farmer in the seventh village of Xiangfeng Township, had no food to eat in the spring and sold a cotton gin. Now his family has enough rice to eat until autumn. Poor farmer Wang Wanfu said: "We have established cooperatives, the price of rice is cheap, and cotton sells for a good price. Two years ago, one dan of seed cotton could be exchanged for five dou of buckwheat, but this year one dan can be exchanged for two shi of rice, who wouldn't eat rice?" According to Xian Zhihong, the vice chairman of the board of directors of the Bingfang Cooperative, the cooperative sold more than 200,600 jin of ginned cotton for its members last winter and this spring, and supplied 138,180 jin of rice, 276 bags of flour, and more than 10,000 jin of buckwheat, reducing intermediate exploitation for its members by about 175 million yuan. During the Spring Festival, most households steamed New Year cakes and steamed buns, and put on new clothes. The cooperative slaughtered 74 pigs, which was not enough to supply. In the past, the children of poor and hired farmers had no money to go to school, such as the Peide Primary School in Xiangfeng Township, which had only more than 60 students last year, but this year it has increased to more than 140 students. It has been divided into two grades and added teachers.

　　Cooperatives Have Become a Strong Backing

　　When cotton farmers talk about cooperatives, no one says they are not good. Cooperative member Shi Wenkui gave a thumbs up and said: "During the Spring Festival, the cooperative sold red dates for 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per jin. In the past, one jin of ginned cotton could only buy one jin of dates, but this year one jin of ginned cotton can buy seven jin of dates." The reason why it is so cheap is because the cooperative has implemented the policy of reducing intermediate exploitation for its members, purchasing directly from the producing areas and selling to its members, without a profit-making perspective.

　　On the morning of April 8, I walked to Bingfang Town and saw many cooperative members crowded in front of the cooperative door, some buying rice, some buying oil..., twenty or thirty cooperative cadres could not cope. A cooperative cadre told me: "Every day there are four or five hundred cooperative members coming to buy and sell, and the cooperative's daily turnover averages around 4 million yuan." In response to the members' request, the cooperative started a trust (i.e., credit purchase) business at the end of last year. Now, every day, members automatically entrust ginned cotton to the cooperative for sale. In the past two months, members have entrusted more than 6,600 jin of ginned cotton to the cooperative. Zhang Zhiming's family in Xinmin Township entrusted 430 jin of ginned cotton. Most of the members who entrust ginned cotton to the cooperative ask the cooperative to handle their living and production materials such as foreign yarn, lime, bricks, soybean cake, and wood. The Bingfang Cooperative had only 49 members when it was established in 1949, but now it has 7,080 members. Under its influence, cooperatives have been established in Dingzi'an, Datong, Dayu Town, Beian, Dong'an and other villages. About 30% of the population in the whole region has joined the cooperative. The members of Zhenxing Village in Xinmin Township account for 90% of the total population of the village.

　　Rest Assured to Grow Cotton Well

　　Before the start of spring planting this year, the government called for expanding the cotton planting area, limiting the planting of mint, and reducing the planting of grain, planning to convert all 224,500 mu of land in the whole area to Daizi cotton, requiring an output of 41.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The County Cotton Reclamation Improvement Institute prepared 2.45 million jin of Daizi cotton seeds. Some cotton farmers believe that planting cotton is not as reliable as miscellaneous grains and mint, and are unwilling to plant too much cotton. Other cotton farmers persuaded them: "Grow more cotton, let the factories spin more yarn, and the cloth will be cheaper in the future!" Zhu Xuecai of Guangrong Village in Xinmin Township said: "We are now growing patriotic cotton. If we grow more cotton, we won't need to import American cotton, which will keep our factories running and increase the strength of the country." In order to help solve the fertilizer problem and ensure the realization of the production increase task, the government allocated 1.2 billion yuan to the area for spreading raw mud (because the local soil is alkaline, a layer of mud must be spread every two years) and covering grass funds. The cooperative pre-purchased cotton with the spreading raw mud and covering grass funds to ensure that the cotton price would only rise and not fall. According to the report of Zhendong Township, 402 households have signed contracts with the Dayu Town Cooperative, selling 44.59 million yuan of raw mud covering funds on credit, and ordering more than 13,000 jin of ginned cotton. Zhu Guangfu of Xiangfeng Township said with emotion when he received the credit sales funds: "With this, I can rest assured to grow cotton. Now I don't have to worry about not having capital, and I don't have to worry about not selling cotton at a good price!"

　　Now, the cotton farmers are working hard on their land. Cotton farmer Jiang Zhaoli said: "I haven't been able to spread raw mud for several years, and the land is always alkaline. This year's raw mud spreading guarantees three years of harvest!" He plans to apply fertilizer twice as much this year, plant in strips, weed five times, and not let down the People's Government and the cooperative for their benefits to him. Old farmer Shi Jia's old father said: "Spreading raw mud once will increase the harvest by at least 30% to 50% this year." In order to further grow cotton well, the area also sent experienced old farmers to participate in the county agricultural production expansion meeting to study cultivation techniques such as plowing, strip planting, fertilizing, weeding, heading, pruning, and seed selection. More than 700 pest control personnel have also been established, and a large number of pesticide powders and 230 sprayers have been prepared. Now, the cotton farmers in Juedong District say: Chairman Mao led us to turn over; now he tells us to grow more cotton and helps us solve the fertilizer problem. It must be right!

### 从灾荒走向富裕的苏北掘东棉区

　　从灾荒走向富裕的苏北掘东棉区
       于伯之
    编者按：苏北如东县掘东垦区棉农战胜灾荒、走向富裕的事实，深刻地说明一个真理，这就是：只有在人民政府的时代，农民才有可能战胜自然灾害，并且逐步走向富裕。而在反动政府统治时期，农民只有日益贫困、破产，如果遇到自然灾害的袭击，其结果是不堪设想的。希望所有棉区农民兄弟们在看了这篇通讯以后，都能回忆一下自己在旧社会的遭遇，回忆一下从什么时候起自己的生产收益才有了保障？并且进一步考虑一下：在人民政府号召棉农把所有存棉卖给或存给国家，以帮助国家克服缺棉困难、供应军民衣着、保持物价平稳的今天，自己对这个号召应该采取什么态度。是置之不顾呢？还是马上卖出棉花，帮助国家克服困难呢？我们相信广大棉农在想通这个道理以后，是会帮助国家克服这种困难的。
    “去年家家闹饥荒，今年米粮堆满仓。”这是苏北沿海经过土地改革的如东县掘东垦区棉农们这两年时常说的话。当我问棉农为什么现在过得这样好时，好多棉农都异口同声回答：“我们靠人民政府领导，分了田地，战胜了灾荒，又办了合作社，改种了岱字棉，收到好秋庄稼，买了便宜的米粮，生活怎么不好呢？”
  战胜严重灾荒
    一九四九年夏历六月二十五日，一天又半夜，刮台风，下暴雨，又当潮汛，内河的水流不出去，水淹到地面二尺多深，把长得茁壮的棉苗和快要收割的玉米，大部淹死了。房子也打坏了，有的刮倒了。很多人无处栖身，非常悲观，觉得没法子生活下去了。这时，人民政府通过各种会议，向群众宣传“人定胜天”的道理，号召共产党员、干部领导群众度荒。镇东乡的朱成本等三十一个党员，在毛主席像前向群众表明一道度荒的决心，提出“逃荒即是耻辱”，因此群众情绪逐渐稳定下来。
    冬天，政府贷下麦种，使大家种了麦子。年关时，政府又发动互助互济，调剂了三百五十石粮。到去年春季，群众困难达到顶点，有的连喝一顿稀粥都感到困难，多数人家吃麸皮、苜蓿、青菜、萝卜度日。这时，政府开始号召办合作社。许多人无钱入股，政府即组织群众到掘港贩运粮食，赚钱入股。当时参加合作社的有二十多人，合作社便开始建立了。与此同时，又发动群众开展副业生产。如捕鱼、拾柴、贩货等。经过这样用多种方法生产，艰苦撑持，他们终于战胜了严重的灾荒，熬到了麦收。
  丰收后的好光景
    这年秋收，全垦区单岱字棉纯种区十多万亩田，就收了皮棉三百六十万斤，平均每亩产皮棉三十来斤。棉农们谁也没有忘记人民政府给他们的好处：贷了二十一万斤豆饼，十三万斤大麦种花贷，二十一万斤大米的锄草贷，贷放了二百三十架喷雾机，五万斤药粉，防治了二万一千多亩的卷叶虫，此外还兴修了涵闸，免除了水患，才有今天的好光景。现在，人们到处可以看见许多新砌起来的房屋。平常年景，除去逢年过节时吃点儿大米，普通只能吃玉米、元麦。今年与往年大不相同了，家家户户都吃着大米。祥丰乡七村里的贫农顾龙才，春上没饭吃，卖掉了一部轧花车。现在家里存的大米能吃到秋天了。贫农王万福说：“我们办了合作社，米价就便宜，棉花卖好价钱，前年一担籽花换到五斗元麦，今年一担就换到两石大米，谁不吃大米呢？”据兵房合作社理事会副主席冼志宏说，现在农民买布要好的，大米要上籼，香烟要“双斧”牌。单去冬今春合作社就替社员群众推销了皮棉二十万零六百多斤，供应了大米十三万八千一百八十斤，面粉二百七十六袋，元麦一万多斤，为社员减轻中间剥削约一亿七千五百多万元。春节期间，多数户蒸了年糕和馒头，穿上了新衣，合作社杀了七十四只猪，还没有够供应。过去贫雇农子弟没钱上学读书的，像祥丰乡培德小学去年只有六十多个学生，今年增加到一百四十多个。分了两级，添了教师。
  合作社成了靠山
    棉农谈起合作社，没有那一个不说好。社员施文魁竖起大姆指说：“春节合作社卖红枣子，一千四五百元一斤。往年，一斤皮棉只能买到一斤枣，今年一斤皮棉能买到七斤枣。”其所以这样便宜，是因为合作社贯彻了为社员减除中间剥削方针，直接从产地购来卖给社员，没有营利观点。
    四月八日早晨，我走到兵房镇上，见有许多社员拥挤在合作社门口，有的买米，有的买油……，二三十个合作社干部都应付不过来。合作社干部告诉我：每天有四、五百个社员来买卖，合作社每天营业额平均在四百万元左右。应社员的要求，去年底合作社办了信托（即赊购）业务，现在每天都有社员自动将皮棉托给合作社卖。两个月来，社员托给合作社的皮棉已有六千六百余斤。新民乡张志明一户就托了四百三十斤皮棉。社员把皮棉托给合作社，大都要求合作社替他办洋纱、石灰、砖头、豆饼、木头等生活与生产资料。兵房合作社在一九四九年成立时只有四十九个社员，现在已有七千零八十个社员了。在它的影响下，丁字岸、大同、大豫镇、北安、东安等村都成立了合作社。全区百分之三十左右的人口参加了合作社。新民乡振兴村的社员已占全村人口的百分之九十。
  放心好好种棉花
    今年春播开始前，政府号召扩大植棉面积，限种薄荷，少种斗粮，计划将全区二十二万四千五百亩田，全部改种岱字棉，要求每亩产四十一斤半皮棉。县棉垦改进所准备了二百四十五万斤岱字棉种。有些棉农认为种棉花不如杂粮和薄荷牢靠，不愿种棉太多，其他棉农就劝他们说：“多长点棉花，给工厂多纺纱，将来布也便宜呀！”新民乡光荣村的朱学才说：“我们现在种的是爱国棉，多长点棉花，就不要美棉进口，就能使我们的工厂不停工，就增加了国家的力量。”政府为了帮助解决肥料困难，保证增产任务实现，又分配给该区十二亿元铺生（因当地是碱土，每两年要铺一层泥）盖草资金，合作社把铺生盖草资金预购棉花，保证棉价听涨不听落。据镇东乡报告，已同大豫镇合作社订立合同的有四百零二户，赊销铺生资金四千四百五十九万元，订购皮棉达一万三千余斤。祥丰乡的朱广福拿到赊销资金时感动地说：“这一来，我安心种棉花了。现在一不愁没本，二不愁棉花卖不到好价啦！”
    现在，棉农们正在自己的土地上紧张地劳动着。棉农姜兆礼说：我几年铺不起生泥，田老是发碱。今年一铺生，三年的收成有了保证啦！”他计划今年加倍施肥，用条播方法种，薅五遍草，不亏人民政府和合作社对他的好处。老农施家老爹说：铺一次生泥，今年收成起码要增加三成到五成。为进一步长好棉花，该区还派有经验的老农参加了县农业生产扩大会议，研究耕种、条播、上肥、锄草、摘头、整枝、选种等耕作技术。又设立了七百多个治虫员，准备了大量药粉和二百三十架喷雾机。现在，掘东区的棉农说：毛主席领导我们翻了身；现在他叫我们多种棉花，还帮助我们解决肥料困难，一定不会错！
