Comparing Political Consciousness, Production Achievements, and Leadership of Mutual Aid Teams
	Wuxiang County, Shanxi, Inspects and Evaluates the Patriotic Production Increase Campaign

	Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has begun the work of summarizing, inspecting, and evaluating the spring patriotic production increase campaign. This summary evaluation focuses on the Yaoshanggou sub-district in the Second District as a key experimental area, emphasizing understanding how patriotic ideological education for resisting America and aiding Korea is combined with the production increase movement; and requiring the discovery of problems from the inspection, overcoming the tendency of formalism in the competition, and the main items of the summary evaluation are: (1) Comparing the political consciousness of the peasant masses: Conducting specific inspections from the aspects of political education and implementation of patriotic pledges in various villages and mutual aid teams. (2) Comparing production achievements: Based on the specific conditions of each village and team, conducting inspections from the aspects of improving technology, diversifying economic crops, and combating drought. (3) Comparing the leadership of mutual aid teams. The standards for labor models are: (1) Labor models must be patriotic models, able to actively participate in patriotic political activities. (2) Must have significant achievements in production. (3) Must be active members in organizing mutual aid.

	In late May, the county concentrated dozens of leading cadres from the county and districts, village cadres from the Second District, and representatives of mutual aid teams to conduct work in the Yaoshanggou sub-district. The results of the inspection and evaluation determined that the patriotic production increase movement in this sub-district had considerable achievements. First, in most villages and mutual aid teams in this sub-district (a total of five administrative villages), patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea has been launched, patriotic pledges have been formulated and implemented, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly enhanced. Twenty-six reading groups have been developed during the competition. Some mutual aid teams have become reading groups for the entire team, and the best Shi Fusheng mutual aid team has also established a cultural center. The five villages have subscribed to 36 copies of the Shanxi Daily and Peasant Daily, and have opened 18 peasant spare-time schools. Except for Beishanggou Village, young and middle-aged farmers in all villages can attend classes on time. During the competition, the patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the majority of the masses have always been full. Some good mutual aid teams have put forward specific political mobilization slogans for every agricultural activity. Therefore, the competition plans of most villages and mutual aid teams can be realized, and some groups have exceeded the plan. All villages have generally promoted agricultural techniques such as soil modification, seed soaking and mixing, and scientific fertilization. Economic crops such as cotton and jute have increased several times compared to last year. As a result of the evaluation, 64 labor models and 23 model mutual aid teams were selected. Among the 47 mutual aid teams that challenged Li Shunda, 22 groups were selected as model groups. Several good mutual aid teams have formulated and implemented a semi-monthly inspection system. Several groups have formulated three-year production plans. Through the competition, the unbalanced state of work development in various villages has been initially overcome. Among the five villages, one was originally a provincial model village, another was a general village, and the other three were backward villages. Now two of the three backward villages have become advanced villages. Nine model mutual aid teams have emerged in these two villages.

	After summarizing the inspection and evaluation, several experiences for further developing the movement were obtained: (1) In order to further combine political education with the production increase movement, the village's patriotic pledge should be more specific, and formulate patriotic production pledges for each mutual aid team. The conditions of the pledge should be closely integrated with the content of production. (2) The competition should be based on mutual aid teams, and first launched in the village. If challenges and responses are proposed with the village as the unit, without fully mobilizing the mutual aid teams, the competition will inevitably become formalistic. (3) Conduct inspections at any time to prevent formalism and tendencies of championship-ism.

　　比政治觉悟，比生产成绩，比互助组的领导        
    山西武乡检查评比爱国丰产竞赛运动
    山西武乡县开始进行春季爱国丰产竞赛运动的总结检查评比工作。这次总结评比以二区窑上沟小区为试验重点，着重了解抗美援朝的爱国思想教育与丰产运动是怎样结合的；并要求从检查中发现问题，克服竞赛中的形式主义偏向，总结评比的主要项目是：（一）比农民群众的政治觉悟：从各村及互助组的政治教育及执行爱国公约等方面作具体检查。（二）比生产成绩：依据各村各组的具体条件，从提高技术、多种经济作物、抗旱斗争等方面进行检查。（三）比互助组的领导。劳动模范的标准是：（一）劳动模范必须是爱国模范，能积极参加爱国的政治活动。（二）必须在生产上有显著成绩。（三）必须是组织互助的积极分子。
    五月下旬，该县集中了县区若干领导干部、二区各村干部及互助组代表共数十人，到窑上沟小区进行工作。检查评比的结果，确定该小区的爱国丰产运动是有相当成绩的。首先是该小区（共五个行政村）多数村庄与互助组中已展开抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，制定并执行了爱国公约，群众爱国热情大大提高。竞赛中读报组已发展了二十六个，有的互助组全组已成为读报组，最好的史富生互助组并成立了文化馆。五个村共订了三十六份山西日报和农民报，共开办了十八座农民业余学校，除北上沟村外，各村青壮年农民都能按时到校上课。竞赛中多数群众的爱国热情与生产热情始终是饱满的。一些好的互助组，在每一项农事活动上都提出了具体的政治鼓动口号。大部分村与互助组的竞赛计划因此都能实现，并有一部分组超过计划。各村已普遍推行调剂土壤、浸种拌种、科学施肥等农业技术。棉花、大麻等经济作物比去年增加数倍。评比结果，选出六十四个劳动模范和二十三个模范互助组。向李顺达应战的四十七个互助组中，有二十二个组被选为模范组。若干好的互助组制订并执行了半月一次的检查制度。若干组已订出三年的生产计划。经过竞赛，各村工作发展不平衡的状态已初步克服。五个村中原来有一个村是全省的模范村，另一个是一般村，还有三个落后村。现在三个落后村已有两个变成先进村。这两个村出现了九个模范互助组。
    经过总结检查与评比，得出几点进一步开展运动的经验：（一）为使政治教育与丰产运动更进一步结合起来，村的爱国公约应更具体化，制订各互助组的爱国生产公约。公约的条件要和生产内容密切结合。（二）开展竞赛要以互助组为基础，首先在本村展开。如以村为单位提出挑战应战，不经过互助组充分发动，势必使竞赛流于形式主义。（三）随时进行检查，防止形式主义与锦标主义偏向。
