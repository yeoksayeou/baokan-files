　　The Chinese Communist Party and Chinese Women
        Cai Chang
    The reason why Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, were able to break free from the three heavy chains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and win the great victory of the liberation struggle, turning themselves into masters of China, is inseparable from the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    First, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao repeatedly taught and led Chinese women to actively participate in the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; pointed out that the suffering of Chinese women was primarily due to class oppression and national oppression; the interests of oppressed Chinese women are consistent with the interests of all oppressed people, and the Chinese women's liberation struggle should be closely integrated with the entire Chinese revolutionary struggle and become a part of the people's revolutionary struggle; only by actively participating in the entire people's revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the proletariat and its political party can the oppressed women of the whole country achieve women's liberation. For the past thirty years, the Chinese women's movement has been advancing along this direction. In every revolutionary period in China, large numbers of working-class and peasant women, intellectual women, and patriotic women have participated, and have increasingly united around the Chinese Communist Party, engaging in unyielding struggles and demonstrating their strength. Especially in the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution—armed struggle—some women bravely stood on the front-line combat posts, directly fighting the armed enemy, or taking on medical, telecommunications, and other tasks; the vast numbers of women in the rear either sent their sons and husbands to join the army, or worked hard to produce in support of the front, or carried out logistics work such as comforting, transporting, carrying stretchers, and caring for the wounded and sick, or organized armed sentry duty, maintained order in the rear, and participated in government work, education work, and actively participated in the rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform struggles. Whether at the front or in the rear, no matter what position they held, women demonstrated their heroic posture and the great role they played in the revolutionary war. In these struggles, not only were women themselves tempered and improved, but they also accelerated the progress of the revolution.
    However, the development of the Chinese women's movement was not entirely smooth sailing. Like the process of the Chinese people's revolution, it also experienced deviations. The emergence of these deviations was closely related to the "left" and right opportunist swings that occurred within the Chinese Communist Party on the entire revolutionary line. For example, during the period when our party cooperated with the bourgeoisie, the view of the bourgeois women's movement replacing the view of the proletarian women's movement once emerged among some cadres in some areas, manifested in only uniting with upper-class women and lacking the necessary struggle, only shouting empty slogans of women's liberation without seriously organizing working-class and peasant women. This was a right-leaning tendency to act as the tail of the bourgeoisie in work, divorced from the broad masses of working-class and peasant women. In addition, there was also a "left" leaning tendency to highlight the women's movement, isolating it from the entire revolutionary struggle, and talking about women's liberation apart from the central political tasks of the time, such as simply mobilizing women to cut their hair and leave their families. In individual areas, the women's movement was turned into daughters-in-law fighting their mothers-in-law and wives fighting their husbands, resulting in chaos within the peasantry. The women's movement did not gain social sympathy, nor did it gain the support of the broad masses of working-class and peasant women.
    The roots of these left-leaning or right-leaning tendencies were reflections of petty-bourgeois ideology, due to departing from the proletarian stance and Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line. However, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, these deviations were promptly corrected.
    Historical experience proves that if the Chinese women's movement can advance closely integrated with the entire revolutionary struggle, the women's movement will develop and contribute to the people's revolutionary struggle; conversely, whoever does not actually participate in the revolutionary struggle, only shouts empty slogans, or departs from the current central task of the entire revolutionary struggle and sets up its own isolated system, will make mistakes, causing setbacks to the women's movement and losses to the people's revolutionary struggle.
    How to extensively mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to actively participate in the people's revolutionary struggle? The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us that it is necessary to address the special demands of women in participating in the revolutionary struggle; to raise women to the level of political struggle by caring about women's vital interests. And the central link to guarantee women's vital interests and mobilize and organize women is that women must participate in productive labor.
    As early as 1933, Chairman Mao said: "... The women workers' and peasants' representative conferences should first focus on the issues of vital interest to the masses of women, and link the mobilization of these issues to all political mobilization. ..." (See Chairman Mao's "Rural Survey")
    In 1942, when Chairman Mao reported on economic and financial issues at the meeting of senior cadres in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he said: "The leading organs of the party's mass women's organizations in the border region,... their first task should be to study and help the masses of women in the border region to participate extensively in productive labor...."
    It is a pity that Chairman Mao's consistent proposition was not understood and grasped by all leaders of women's work from the very beginning. It was not until after the Chinese Communist Party launched a rectification movement throughout the party in 1942 that women's work used the weapon of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought to conduct a review of the work, systematically criticized various deviations in the women's movement, and clarified the policy of taking production as the central task of the women's movement. For this reason, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specially issued the "Decision on the Current Women's Work Policy in Various Anti-Japanese Base Areas" in 1943, and Chairman Mao put forward the call of "go deep into the masses, do not indulge in empty talk," focusing on criticizing some women cadres who were "floating on the upper level, idle, not ashamed, but proud," and at the same time encouraging everyone to go deep into the masses of women, understand the actual situation, mobilize and organize women to produce, and solve their specific problems in production.
    From then on, Chairman Mao's correct policy and correct methods regarding the Chinese women's movement were fully accepted by all party cadres and implemented in actual work. The face of the women's movement was completely renewed.
    For the past thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led Chinese women to gain true liberation. The painful life of Chinese women, characterized by inferiority, humiliation, and ignorance, has been and is being gradually and permanently consigned to the past, never to return and never to be allowed to return. We have obtained happiness that Chinese women had never dreamed of for thousands of years, we have achieved the wishes sought by revolutionary martyrs who went through fire and water, and we will continue to create our increasingly bright and happy life on the basis of the continuous efforts of all working people, including working women, in production and struggle. Looking back at the previous history, we can only come to one conclusion: without the Chinese Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for Chinese women. Only by following the Chinese Communist Party forever and following Chairman Mao forever can Chinese women achieve complete and final liberation.
    At present, the people of the whole country are vigorously carrying out the patriotic movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing production, which is a deeper and more thorough struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and a necessary action for the Chinese people to consolidate their victory.
    In the current great patriotic movement, women across the country have once again demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and good results, but we should not be complacent because of this. We should continue to work hard, working, producing and studying with fighting spirit, and strive to implement the Patriotic Pact to resist US aggression and aid Korea and build the motherland. And we are using this most practical action to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the glorious struggle of the Chinese Communist Party. Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

　　中国共产党与中国妇女
        蔡畅
    中国妇女之所以能和全国人民一道，挣脱帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三条粗重的锁链，获得伟大的解放斗争的胜利，翻身做了中国的主人，这一切，是和中国共产党、毛主席英明、正确的领导分不开的。
    首先，中国共产党和毛主席反复地教导了并领导了中国妇女积极参加了中国人民反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的斗争；指出了中国妇女的痛苦，首先是因为有阶级压迫和民族压迫的缘故；中国被压迫的妇女与全体被压迫的人民利害关系是一致的，中国妇女的解放斗争，应与全中国革命斗争紧密结合并成为人民革命斗争的一部分；全国被压迫的妇女，也只有在无产阶级及其政党领导之下，积极参加整个人民革命斗争，才能获得妇女的解放。三十年来，中国妇女运动，正是循着这一指示前进的。在中国各个革命时期，都有广大的工农劳动妇女、知识妇女和爱国妇女们参加，并且日益增多地团结在中国共产党的周围，进行着不屈不挠的斗争，显示了自己的力量。特别在中国革命斗争的主要形式——武装斗争中，有一部分妇女英勇地站到前线战斗岗位上，直接和武装的敌人作战，或担任着医务、电讯等工作；后方的广大妇女，或送子、送夫参军，或努力生产支援前线，或进行慰劳、运输、抬担架，护理伤病员等后勤工作，或组织武装站岗放哨，维持后方秩序，以及参加政权工作、教育工作和积极参加减租减息和土地改革斗争。妇女们不论在前方、后方，不论在什么岗位上，都表现了她们的英雄姿态和对革命战争的伟大作用。在这些斗争中，不但锻炼和提高了妇女自身，而且也加速了革命的进展。
    但中国妇女运动的发展，并不是完全一帆风顺的，它和中国人民革命的过程一样，也曾经产生过偏向，这些偏向的产生，是与中国共产党内在整个革命路线上发生“左”右倾机会主义的摇摆密切联系着。如在我们党和资产阶级合作的时期，曾经在部分地区，部分干部中，产生以资产阶级妇女运动的观点来代替无产阶级的妇女运动的观点，表现在只和上层妇女进行团结而缺乏必要的斗争，只空喊妇女解放的口号，而不着手认真地组织工农劳动妇女。这是一种工作上做了资产阶级的尾巴，脱离了广大工农劳动妇女的右的倾向。另外也曾经产生过将妇女运动突出，把它从整个的革命斗争中孤立起来，离开当时的中心政治任务来谈妇女解放的左的倾向，如单纯地动员妇女剪发，离开家庭等，个别地区曾将妇女运动变成为媳妇斗公婆，妻子斗丈夫，结果造成农民内部的混乱，妇女运动得不到社会的同情，也得不到广大工农劳动妇女的拥护。
    产生这种左倾或右倾的根源，都是小资产阶级思想的反映，是由于离开了无产阶级立场和毛主席的正确革命路线的缘故。但终由于中国共产党、毛主席的领导，对于这些偏向都及时给予了纠正。
    历史的经验证明，中国妇女运动，如能与整个革命斗争紧密结合前进时，妇女运动就有发展，对人民革命斗争就有贡献；反之，凡不实际参加革命斗争，只空喊口号，或离开整个革命斗争的当前中心任务，自己孤立地搞一套，就犯了错误，就使妇女运动遭受挫折，使人民革命斗争遭受损失。
    如何广泛地动员与组织广大妇女群众积极参加人民革命斗争呢？中国共产党、毛主席又反复教导我们，必须解决妇女在参加革命斗争中妇女的特殊要求；从关心妇女的切身利益，来提高妇女到政治斗争的水平。而保障妇女切身利益、动员与组织妇女的中心环节，就是妇女必须参加生产劳动。
    一九三三年毛主席即说过：“……女工农妇代表会，首先应该抓紧妇女群众的切身利益问题，跟着这些问题的动员，联系到一切政治的动员。……”（见毛主席著《农村调查》）
    一九四二年毛主席在陕甘宁边区高级干部会上报告经济问题与财政问题时，他曾说：“边区党的群众的妇女组织领导机关，……她们的第一个任务就应是研究与帮助边区妇女群众广泛地参加生产劳动的问题。……”
    毛主席的这一贯的主张，可惜不是一开始就被所有妇女工作领导者所领会所掌握。一直到一九四二年中国共产党全党展开了整风运动之后，妇女工作才以马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的武器，进行了工作的检查，有系统地批判了妇女运动中的各种偏向；明确了以生产为妇女运动中心工作的方针。中共中央特为此于一九四三年发表了“关于各抗日根据地目前妇女工作方针”的决定，毛主席并提出“深入群众，不尚空谈”的号召，着重在批评一些“浮在上层，空闲无事，不以为耻，反以为荣”的妇女工作干部，同时也是鼓励大家深入妇女群众，了解实际情况，动员和组织妇女生产，解决她们生产中的具体问题。
    从此，毛主席关于中国妇女运动的正确方针、正确方法，才被全党干部全部接受并贯彻到实际工作中去。妇女运动的面貌为之一新。
    三十年来，中国共产党毛主席领导了中国妇女获得了真正的解放，中国妇女的卑贱、屈辱、愚昧的痛苦生活已经并正在逐步地永远地成为过去的东西，不会再回来也不准它再回来了。我们已经得到几千年来中国妇女梦想不到的幸福，我们已经达到了革命先烈赴汤蹈火以寻求的愿望，并将在全体劳动人民包括劳动妇女在内继续努力生产和奋斗的基础上创造我们日益光明的和幸福的生活。我们回顾以前的历史，只能得出一个结论，就是没有中国共产党，没有毛主席，就没有中国妇女的今天。中国妇女只有永远跟着中国共产党走，跟着毛主席走，才能获得彻底的、最后的解放。
    目前全国人民正轰轰烈烈地进行抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命和发展生产的爱国运动，这正是中国人民反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义斗争的更深入更彻底和中国人民巩固自己胜利的必要行动。
    全国妇女在目前的伟大的爱国运动中，又一次表现了高度的积极性和很好的成绩，但我们不要因此而自满。我们应该继续努力，以战斗的精神努力生产、工作和学习，努力实现爱国公约来抗美援朝，建设祖国。而我们也就是用这种最实际的行动，来庆祝中国共产党光荣斗争的三十周年。中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
