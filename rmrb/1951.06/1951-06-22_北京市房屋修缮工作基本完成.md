　　Beijing's Housing Repair Work Basically Completed
    Of the approximately 60,000 civilian houses in urban Beijing that needed repair, nearly 50,000 have been repaired, accounting for more than 80% of the houses needing repair, thanks to the strong advocacy and assistance of the People's Government and the joint efforts of landlords and tenants. The remaining portion will also be completed before the rainy season.
    Under the long-term rule of Japanese invaders, traitors, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people lived in extreme poverty, unable not only to build new houses but also to maintain the existing ones, most of which fell into disrepair year after year. Every rainy season, leaking roofs and collapsing houses became a major disaster for the citizens. After liberation, in order to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, the People's Government adopted various measures to organize the masses to protect and repair houses. In the second half of last year, housing repair committees were established under the people's representative conferences and consultative committees of various districts to promote repair work. Despite unfamiliarity with the situation, lack of experience, and limited time, by the end of last year, the masses had been mobilized to repair more than 11,000 houses, laying a good foundation for this year's work.
    This year, the districts started housing repair work one after another in early March and widely communicated it to the citizens after discussions and resolutions made by the people's representative conferences of each district. The districts first strengthened and expanded the organization of the housing repair committees, implemented a division of labor responsibility system based on districts, and established various work systems. Sub-committees and groups were established within the jurisdiction of each police station, and district, street representatives, and enthusiastic citizens from all walks of life were widely absorbed to participate in the work. Each district generally had one to two hundred people, and each group also formulated patriotic covenants and launched work competitions. The working mood has been very full, which is an important force for the smooth development and successful completion of the entire repair work. The districts successively convened large and small mobilization meetings and symposiums of landlords and tenants. Responsible cadres explained in detail the urban housing policies and relevant laws and regulations of the People's Government, answered difficult questions, and listened to the opinions of the masses present, which was very effective. Many landlords and tenants immediately negotiated house repairs after the meeting. For example, more than 3,300 houses were repaired independently in the first district. Each group also went deep into the large and small hutongs and courtyards to carry out work. After repeated publicity and mobilization, the landlords changed their wrong and passive attitudes such as "Let it collapse!" and "It's good to drive tenants to move." Some said, "The property is our own, and if it collapses, we will be the ones to suffer," and others said, "The government cares about us so much, we would be letting the government down if we didn't repair the houses." Many landlords not only repaired their own houses but also mobilized others to repair them. The tenants also changed various wrong ideas of "getting by." Some said, "Three pounds of rice for a room is not enough for even a shovel of ash, how can you ask people to repair it!" Many tenants also took the initiative to propose rent increases to the landlords, requesting the landlords to repair the houses. In this way, under the promotion and help of the Housing Repair Committee, the landlords and tenants, based on the actual situation, negotiated and formulated specific measures for repairs. Some also signed agreements to ensure the timely completion of the repair work.
    In the process of housing repair, many difficult problems were encountered, but most of them were resolved through persuasion, mobilization, and the specific assistance of the staff. The repair methods are roughly as follows: (1) If the rent is generally appropriate and the landlord has the strength to repair, the landlord is mobilized to carry out the repair. (2) Although the landlord has the strength to repair, but the rent is too low, the two parties negotiate to appropriately increase the rent, and the landlord carries out the repair. There are also cases where the house is repaired first and then the rent is adjusted, or both are done simultaneously. (3) If the landlord does not have the strength to repair or the landlord does not live in the city, the tenant will repair it on behalf of the landlord, and the Housing Repair Committee will issue a certificate, and the repair fee will be deducted from the rent in installments. (4) If both the landlord and the tenant do not have sufficient strength, the two parties will jointly repair the house, or the landlord will buy the materials and the tenant will provide the labor. Some masses also organized labor exchange and mutual assistance to repair houses.
    In addition, the People's Government further instructed the People's Bank of China to provide low-interest loans for housing repairs and allocated a batch of relief grain for housing repairs to those with special difficulties, providing loans or relief separately. According to very incomplete statistics, approximately 300 million yuan has been loaned out and more than 90,000 kilograms of relief grain have been distributed.
    At present, most of the problems have been properly resolved, and the districts are studying and solving the few remaining difficult problems separately.

### 北京市房屋修缮工作基本完成

　　北京市房屋修缮工作基本完成
    北京市城区应该修缮的市民住房约六万间，在人民政府大力倡导、扶助与房主房客的共同努力下，已修好的房屋近五万间，约占应修房屋的百分之八十以上。其余部分也争取在雨季以前完成。
    在日寇汉奸国民党反动派的长期统治下，人民生活极度贫困，不但无力建造新房，即现有房屋也大部分年久失修，破旧的一年比一年增多，每到雨季，房漏屋塌，成为市民的一大灾害。解放后，人民政府为了保障市民生命、财产的安全，曾采用各种办法组织群众保护与修缮房屋。去年下半年又在各区各界人民代表会议协商委员会下设立了房屋修缮委员会，负责推动修缮工作。在情况生疏，经验缺乏，时间短促的情况下，到去年年底，即已动员群众修好了一万一千多间房屋，为今年的工作打下了良好的基础。
    今年各区早于三月初旬即先后开始房屋修缮工作，并经区各界人民代表会议进行讨论作出决议后向市民普遍传达。各区首先健全与扩大了房屋修缮委员会的组织，以地区为单位实行分工负责制，并建立了各种工作制度，在各派出所管界内设立分会、小组，广泛地吸收了区、街代表及各阶层中热心公益的市民参加工作，各区一般都有一、二百人，各组还订立了爱国公约，展开工作竞赛，工作情绪一直很饱满，这是整个修缮工作能够顺利开展和胜利完成的重要力量。各区先后召开了房主房客的大小型动员会和座谈会，由负责干部详尽地讲解了人民政府的城市房屋政策与有关法令，解答疑难问题，听取到会群众的意见，收效很大，很多房主房客会后立刻协商修房。如一区自行修缮的房屋就有三千三百多间。各组也都分头深入大小胡同、院落进行工作。经过这样反复宣传动员后，房主转变了“塌了算啦！”“塌了好撵房客搬家”等错误的和消极的态度，有的说“产业是自己的，塌了还不是自己倒霉”，有的说“政府这样关心我们，不修房真对不起政府”。很多房主除自动修房外，还动员别人修。房客方面也转变了过去“得过且过”的各种错误想法，有的说“一间房三斤米，连一锹灰都不够，叫人家怎么修法！”不少房客也就主动向房主提出增租，要求房主修房。就这样在房屋修缮委员会的推动与帮助下，房主房客双方根据实际情况，经过协商，订出具体办法，进行了修缮。有的还签订了协议书，保证定期完成修缮工作。
    在房屋修缮过程中，曾遇到不少困难问题，经过说服，动员和工作人员的具体帮助，大都获得了解决。修缮办法大致有以下几种：（一）房租一般的还适当，房主又有修缮力量的，就动员房主进行修缮。（二）房主虽有力量修缮，但房租太低的，由双方协商适当提高房租，由房主进行修缮。也有先修房再调整租金或同时进行的。（三）房主没有力量修缮或房主不在本市居住的，则由房客代修，房屋修缮委员会开具证明，修缮费从房租内分期扣还。（四）房主与房客力量都不足的，由双方合力修缮，或由房主买材料，房客出人力修缮。有的群众并组织变工互助修房。
    此外，人民政府更指令中国人民银行，举办房屋修缮低利贷款，并由政府拨发一批房屋修缮救济粮，对有特殊困难的分别予以贷款或救济。据极不完全的统计，已贷出款额约三亿元，发放救济粮九万余斤。
    目前，大部分问题已妥善解决，还有少数困难问题，各区正分别研究解决中。
