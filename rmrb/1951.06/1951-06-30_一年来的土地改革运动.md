The Land Reform Movement Over the Past Year
         By Liao Luyan
    On June 30, 1950, the Central People's Government promulgated the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue was also published at the same time. Over the past year, under the guidance of these two major documents, the land reform movement in the four major administrative regions of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest has achieved brilliant results.
    Over the past year, mainly during the months of winter 1950 and spring 1951, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of approximately 130 million in the newly liberated areas of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest. Combined with the old liberated areas, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of approximately 290 million nationwide. In the past year of land reform, the number of confiscated and requisitioned land and the number of people who received land have not been fully counted. According to some incomplete surveys, it is roughly estimated that about 150 million mu of land were confiscated and requisitioned, and distributed to about 80 million poor peasants. If, before land reform, each mu of land had to pay an average of 100 jin of grain in rent to landlords each year (this is a relatively conservative calculation), then after these 150 million mu of land were confiscated, requisitioned, and distributed, the landlord class's annual rent exploitation of 7.5 million tons of grain would be permanently abolished, which means an increase of 7.5 million tons of grain in income for farmers each year. What an astonishing number! In the areas where land reform has been completed, the rural landscape has been completely renewed, and the broad masses of peasants have truly become the masters of the countryside, engaged in labor on their own land, and their production enthusiasm has been significantly improved. In the four major administrative regions of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest, the number of peasant association members has grown to over 84.6 million, and the number of militiamen has reached over 7 million. Due to the land reform movement, as well as the simultaneous suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the resistance to America and aid to Korea, the political consciousness of the peasants has greatly increased, and the people's democratic dictatorship has greatly advanced.
    The land reform movement over the past year has been carried out with leadership, order, and planning. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law and Vice Chairman Liu's report, a widespread and in-depth study movement was launched in various regions, and tens of thousands of cadres with experience in land reform work were transferred. More than 200,000 intellectuals and unemployed workers in cities were recruited to open training classes and train them. The learning in the training classes was combined with the trial implementation of land reform in typical villages. After the training, a land reform work team with a total of about 300,000 people was formed and dispatched to the countryside to help peasants carry out land reform. After the movement began, the leading organs also firmly grasped the leadership method of "grasping typical examples, gaining experience, and promoting the general," so that the movement gradually expanded step by step in a wave-like manner. The leading organs discovered some deviations in the work of individual districts and townships and corrected them in a very short period of time, and notified these deviations to various places to make everyone vigilant and avoid repeating them. Therefore, the land reform movement over the past year has been a great success and of unprecedented scale. The entire movement was carried out with leadership, planning, and order, and no major deviations occurred.
    At the same time, the experience of the land reform movement over the past year has once again proved that the general line and general policy of land reform indicated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are completely correct. "Relying on farm laborers and poor peasants, uniting with middle peasants, preserving the rich peasant economy, and eliminating the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinctions to develop agricultural production." This is a summary of our Party's thirty years of leading the peasant revolution, and it is also a summary of the revolutionary practice of thousands of millions of Chinese peasants. Some people once believed that "it is not necessary to rely on farm laborers and poor peasants to carry out land reform," or, in view of the mistakes of infringing on the interests of middle peasants in some areas during the 1947 land reform, expressed wavering about the policy of relying on farm laborers and poor peasants. After a year of practice, all those who participated in land reform work or visited the countryside to observe land reform, even those who had previously disagreed with the policy of relying on farm laborers and poor peasants, unanimously believed that to carry out land reform, it is necessary to rely on farm laborers and poor peasants. Relying on farm laborers and poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants are both indispensable, and only by relying on farm laborers and poor peasants and fully mobilizing them can we better unite with middle peasants. There is no contradiction between the two.
    The experience of the land reform movement over the past year has also proved that to thoroughly implement land reform, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses under leadership. Simply relying on administrative orders, doing everything for the masses, and "peacefully dividing land" cannot truly and thoroughly realize land reform and eliminate feudal forces. In the autumn of 1950, when various regions were trying out land reform in typical villages, some villages and towns had a tendency to "peacefully divide land." In October and November of the same year, the major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Northwest successively convened summary meetings on typical experiments of land reform, criticized the tendency of "peaceful land distribution," and implemented the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses under leadership, thereby putting the movement that unfolded widely after the autumn harvest on the right track and achieving great success. Experience has proven that organizing land reform work teams, convening peasant representative meetings, holding training courses for peasant activists, and leading land reform workers and peasant cadres to go deep into the masses, visit the poor and ask about their suffering, and discover activists among farm laborers and poor peasants are indispensable steps in boldly mobilizing the masses under leadership.
    The experience of the land reform movement over the past year has also proven that the anti-feudal united front is very broad. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, widespread and in-depth publicity was carried out not only in rural areas, but also in large, medium, and small cities across the country, which is of great benefit to the establishment of a broad anti-feudal united front. Local organizations of the Communist Party, local people's governments, peasant associations, and federations of industry and commerce jointly formed urban-rural liaison committees and urban-rural liaison offices to resolve disputes between industrialists and businessmen who also own land and peasants in the land reform movement. This is a very good organizational form, which is convenient for thoroughly realizing land reform and protecting industry and commerce from infringement. This is a creation of the land reform movement over the past year. Under the conditions that the people's revolution has won a national victory and large, medium, and small cities all belong to the people, this organizational form is needed, and it guarantees the establishment of the broadest anti-feudal united front. Absorbing a large number of intellectuals to participate in land reform work teams, and organizing democratic parties and non-party democrats to participate in land reform work or visit the countryside to observe land reform are also effective measures to consolidate the anti-feudal united front. This not only helped these people to be tempered, transformed, and progressed in this great and fierce class struggle, but also helped the implementation of the correct land reform policy. It is precisely because the land reform movement over the past year has been supported by a broad anti-feudal united front that it has been able to achieve such great success so smoothly.
    Finally, although the land reform movement over the past year has achieved great results, according to materials from various regions, in general, 20% of the villages in the areas where land reform has been completed still have incomplete elimination of feudalism, insufficient mobilization of the masses, and many problems left over from land reform. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose complacency among some cadres and to do a good job of ending the land reform in a responsible manner. At the same time, for those villages where land reform has been relatively thoroughly realized, we should immediately lead the masses to turn to production and education, solve the masses' concerns and difficulties in developing production, and train peasant activists in land reform. In short, we must use land reform to firmly lay the foundation for future rural work.

　　一年来的土地改革运动
         廖鲁言
    一九五○年六月三十日，中央人民政府公布了中华人民共和国土地改革法，刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告也在同时发表。一年以来，华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区的土地改革运动，在这两大文献指导之下，已获得了辉煌的成绩。
    一年以来，主要是在一九五○年冬天和一九五一年春天的几个月中，在华东、中南、西南、西北各新解放区，约有一亿三千万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，连老解放区合计，全国已有约二亿九千万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革。在过去一年的土地改革运动中，没收、征收的土地数目和分得土地的人数，尚无完全的统计，根据若干不完全的调查，粗略估计一下，约有一亿五千万亩土地被没收征收，分配给八千万左右的贫苦农民。如果在土地改革前，每亩土地每年平均须向地主交纳地租一百斤粮食（这是比较保守的计算），那么，这一亿五千万亩土地被没收、征收、分配以后，就永远废除了这一部分地主阶级每年七百五十万吨粮食的地租剥削，也就是为农民每年增加了七百五十万吨粮食的收入。这是何等惊人的数目啊！在已经完成土地改革的地区，农村面貌已焕然一新，广大农民群众已真正成为农村的主人，在自己的土地上从事劳动，生产情绪已有显著的提高。在华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区中，农民协会会员已发展到八千四百六十余万人，民兵人数已达七百万以上。由于土地改革运动，以及同时进行的镇压反革命运动和抗美援朝运动，农民的政治觉悟大大提高，人民民主专政大大前进了一步。
    一年来的土地改革运动是有领导、有秩序、有计划地进行的。在土地改革法和刘副主席的报告公布之后，各地即展开了广泛深入的学习运动，抽调了几万有土地改革工作经验的干部，并在城市中吸收了二十多万知识分子和失业工人开办训练班，加以训练。训练班的学习又与典型乡的试办土地改革相结合。训练以后，组成了总数共约三十万人的土地改革工作队，分派到乡村中去，帮助农民实行土地改革。运动开始以后，领导机关又紧紧掌握了“抓住典型，取得经验，推动一般”的领导方法，使运动有步骤地波浪式地逐步扩展。领导机关发现个别区乡在工作中发生的一些偏差，在很短的时间之内就加以纠正，并将这些偏差通报各地，使大家警惕起来，不再重犯。因此，一年来的土地改革运动，成绩是巨大的，规模是空前的。整个运动是有领导、有计划、有秩序地进行的，没有发生什么大的偏差。
    同时，一年来土地改革运动的经验也再次证明：毛主席和党中央所指示的土地改革的总路线与总政策是完全正确的。“依靠雇农、贫农，团结中农，保存富农经济，有步骤有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产。”这是我们党三十年来领导农民革命的经验总结，也是中国千千万万农民革命实践的总结。有些人曾经认为“实行土地改革不必依靠雇农、贫农”，或者是鉴于一九四七年土地改革中部分地区发生侵犯中农利益的错误，而对依靠雇农贫农的方针表示动摇。经过这一年来的实践，凡是参加了土地改革工作或下乡参观过土地改革的人，即便是以前曾经不赞成依靠雇农贫农的方针，也一致地认为要实行土地改革，就必须依靠雇农贫农。依靠雇农贫农与团结中农，二者不可偏废，而且只有依靠雇农贫农，把雇贫农充分发动起来，才能更好地团结中农，二者并无矛盾。
    一年来土地改革运动的经验又证明：要彻底实行土地改革，必须有领导地放手发动群众。单纯依靠行政命令，包办代替，“和平分田”，是不可能真正彻底实现土地改革，消灭封建势力的。一九五○年秋季，各地在典型乡试办土地改革时，曾有若干乡村发生了“和平分田”的倾向。同年十月十一月间，华东、中南、西北各大行政区，先后召开了土地改革典型试验总结会议，批判了“和平分田”的倾向，贯彻了有领导地放手发动群众的方针，因而使秋收以后广泛展开的运动走上正确的道路，获得了巨大的成绩。经验证明组织土地改革工作队，召集农民代表会，举办农民积极分子训练班，领导土地改革工作人员和农民干部深入群众，访贫问苦，发现雇贫农中的积极分子，是有领导地放手发动群众所不可缺少的步骤。
    一年来土地改革运动的经验也证明：反封建的统一战线是非常广泛的。中华人民共和国土地改革法公布以后，即在全国各地，不仅在乡村中，而且在大、中、小城市中进行了普遍深入的宣传，这对广泛的反封建统一战线之建立是有很大好处的。由共产党的地方组织、地方人民政府、农民协会和工商联合会等共同组成城乡联络委员会和城乡联络处，来解决那些兼有土地的工商业者在土地改革运动中与农民的纠纷。这是一种很好的组织形式，既便于彻底实现土地改革，又便于保护工商业不受侵犯。这是一年来土地改革运动中的一个创造。在人民革命已获得全国胜利，大、中、小城市都属于人民所有的条件下实行土地改革，这种组织形式是需要的，它保证了最广泛的反封建统一战线的建立。吸收大批知识分子参加土地改革工作队，组织各民主党派和无党派的民主人士参加土地改革工作或下乡参观土地改革，也是巩固反封建统一战线的有效措施。这不仅帮助了这些人们在这一伟大激烈的阶级斗争中得到锻炼、改造和进步，而且帮助了正确的土地改革政策的贯彻实施。正因为一年来的土地改革运动是由广泛的反封建统一战线所支持的，所以才能这样顺利地得到了巨大的成就。
    最后，一年来的土地改革运动虽然有巨大的成绩，但据各地材料看来，在已完成土地改革的地区，一般仍有百分之二十的乡村，消灭封建不彻底，群众发动不充分，土地改革中遗留问题也较多。因此，必须反对某些干部中的自满情绪，必须用负责到底的精神，把结束土地改革的工作认真做好。同时，对那些土地改革业已比较彻底实现了的乡村，就应当立即领导群众转入生产和教育的工作，解决群众对发展生产的顾虑和困难，训练土地改革中的农民积极分子。总之，必须利用土地改革把今后农村工作的基础结结实实地打好。
