Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: U.S. imperialism has forcibly incorporated the Japanese economy into the mobilization system for the U.S.'s expanded war of aggression. It is now driving the Yoshida government to accelerate the implementation of policies that shift Japanese industry to munitions production. Marquat, director of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of the U.S. occupation headquarters in Japan, issued a statement on May 16 regarding the rapid establishment of a U.S.-Japan "economic partnership system," blatantly pointing out that Japan must become an arsenal for the U.S. in the Far East. To achieve this goal, "Japan must make considerable sacrifices." Under the instructions of the U.S. military headquarters, the Yoshida government has spent large amounts of funds to purchase strategic raw materials and subsidize military production, resulting in the shrinking and stagnation of peaceful industries, which now face a crisis. Some Japanese business leaders are therefore very worried that the Japanese economy will return to militarization.

According to a Kyodo News report on June 5, the Japanese reactionnary government's Economic Stabilization Board also does not hide the fact that Japan has been incorporated into the U.S. war of aggression mobilization system. It expresses concern over the increasing prices and currency issues, and requires the establishment of a "comprehensive economic policy" to further "curb funds for non-urgent industries." In fact, Japan's peaceful industry has been strangled. First of all, the import of food and raw materials for light industry has sharply decreased due to insufficient funds. Taking only July and August of last year as examples, food imports decreased by 50 percent and cotton by 48 percent. Secondly, due to the lack of transportation, freight and passenger transport between ports has almost completely stopped. As of April this year, the state-owned railways had accumulated two million tons of goods that could not be transported. At the same time, due to the U.S. occupation headquarters' restrictions on electricity, only 45 percent of the total is supplied to non-military industrial sectors and residents, so the power supply is very difficult. For example, parts of the wood industry, textile industry, and rice mills in Osaka and Tokyo have been forced to shut down and go bankrupt as a result.

Because Japan's peaceful economy has fallen into a state of enslavement dependent on the United States, it has caused the following disastrous results: unemployment has surged. By the end of March this year, the urban unemployed population had reached 950,000, and the semi-unemployed population working less than 35 hours per week had reached 12 million. In addition, there are 5.5 million unemployed people in rural areas. Inflation has reached 410 billion yen in circulation by the end of April this year. As early as October 21 last year, the Japan Times reported that a report submitted to the Congressional Budget Committee by U.S. financial expert Schoepper stated that Japan's "national economy is on the verge of crisis." The crisis is constantly expanding.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: Under the dual exploitation of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, the lives of the Japanese people are increasingly difficult, and the lives of women and children are particularly miserable.

According to a May 25 editorial in the Asahi Shimbun, there are a total of 14 million men and women engaged in agriculture in Japan this year, of which women account for 52 percent, which is 200,000 to 300,000 more than men. In 1930, women accounted for only 45 percent, in 1947 they accounted for 52 percent, and in July of last year they actually accounted for about 70 percent. The number of women engaged in agricultural labor is 4 million more than men. Moreover, women undertake the most arduous labor, and they cannot rest during their pregnancy. Taking the survey of the Kounosu Agricultural Experiment Station last year as an example, Japanese women work in the fields for 12 hours a day during the busy farming season, plus 4 hours of housework, working more than 16 hours a day. Due to this overwork, many women die from difficult births and miscarriages during the busy farming months of May, June, and July, and most women do not get rest after childbirth.

Although Japanese women do such heavy labor, they still cannot make a living. The number of women who have abortions due to economic reasons is increasing. According to statistics published by the Japanese reactionary government's Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of open abortions by Japanese women in 1950 was three times higher than in 1949. There were 168,961 abortion cases in 1949 and 480,111 cases in 1950.

The lives of children are even more miserable. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Youth Problem Agreement of the Ministry of Education of Japan, in only 30 prefectures and counties, there are about 600,000 children with school enrollment who are absent from classes for a long time, of which 72 percent, or 430,000 people, are absent from classes because "family life is difficult, and there is no food to eat without working" and "must help the family with work." If this number is added to street children and war-stricken children, the total number exceeds one million. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are about 400,000 homeless children who have not been taken in across the country, which is just a greatly discounted official figure.

### 美驱使日本加紧备战  日和平工业已被扼杀  日本妇女儿童生活极为悲惨

　　美驱使日本加紧备战        
　  日和平工业已被扼杀         
  　日本妇女儿童生活极为悲惨
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义已强把日本经济编入美国扩大侵略战争的动员体制中，目前正驱使吉田政府加紧执行使日本工业转向军火生产的政策。美国驻日占领军总部经济科学局局长马贵特五月十六日发表关于迅速建立美日“经济提携体制”的声明，肆无忌惮地指出，日本要成为美国在远东的兵工厂，为了达到这一目的，“日本方面必须作相当的牺牲”。吉田政府在美军司令部的指示之下，支出大批经费收买战略原料、资助军需生产，造成了和平工业的萎缩和停顿，和平工业已面临危机。一部分日本工商界人士，因此非常担忧日本经济重新走上军国主义化。
    据六月五日共同社消息，日本反动政府经济安定本部也不隐讳日本已编入美国侵略战争动员体制的事实，并对日益增长的物价与通货问题，表示危惧，该部要求树立“综合性经济政策”，进一步“对不急需产业资金加以抑制”。事实上日本的和平工业已遭受扼杀。首先民食和轻工业原料的输入，因资金不足早已锐减；仅以去年七、八两月为例，粮食入口减少了百分之五十，棉花减少了百分之四十八。其次因交通运输缺乏，各港口间的货运、客运几完全停顿；国营铁道到今年四月已堆集二百万吨的货物，不能运送。同时因美国占领军总部限制电力，只有总额百分之四十五供给非军事部门工业与居民之用，所以动力供应甚感困难。如大阪和东京部分的木业、纺织业，碾米厂都已因此被迫停工和倒闭。
    由于日本的和平经济陷于依赖美国的被奴役的地位，致造成下列灾难性的结果：失业激增，到今年三月止，城市失业人口已达九十五万人，每周不满三十五小时工作之半失业人口，已达一千二百万人，另在农村尚有五百五十万人失业。通货膨胀，到今年四月底，日元发行额已增到四千一百亿。早在去年十月二十一日日本时报即载称：国会预算委员会呈交美国财政专家萧伯的报告中说：日本“国民经济已处于危机的边缘”：目前危机正在不断扩大中。
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：在美帝国主义及日本反动派双重剥削下，日本人民的生活困苦日增，妇女和儿童的生活尤为悲惨。
    据五月二十五日日本朝日新闻社论称，日本全国从事农业的男女今年共有一千四百万人，其中女子占百分之五十二，比男子多二、三十万人。一九三○年女子仅占百分之四十五，一九四七年占百分之五十二，而去年七月一个月间实际占到百分之七十左右，女子从事农业劳动的人数比男子多四百万人。而且妇女所担任的都是最繁重的劳动，产期也得不到休息。以去年鸿巢农事实验场的调查为例，农忙期日本妇女每天在田野劳动十二小时，另加家事劳动四小时，每天劳动十六小时以上。由于这种过度劳动，在农忙期的五、六、七三个月中，妇女因难产、小产而死者很多，产后大部分妇女得不到休养。
    日本妇女虽做这样繁重劳动，但仍无法生活。为经济所迫而堕胎者日益增多。仅据日本反动政府厚生省发表的统计，一九五○年日本妇女公开堕胎的数目比一九四九年高三倍。一九四九年堕胎案为十六万八千九百六十一宗，一九五○年为四十八万零一百一十一宗。
    儿童的生活更为悲惨。据文部省青少年问题协议会经过全国教育委员会调查的结果，仅在三十个府县内，有学籍而长期缺课的儿童共约六十万人，其中百分之七十二即四十三万人的缺课原因，是“家庭生活困难，不做工就没有饭吃”、“必须帮助家庭干活”等。若把此数再加上流浪儿童、战灾儿童，则总数超过一百万以上。另据厚生省调查，在全国没有收容的流浪儿童约有四十万人，这不过是大大打了折扣的官方数字。
