Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 31st: The International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on the atrocities of the US military in Korea has successfully completed its investigation after visiting Sinuiju, Pyongyang, Kanggye, Manpojin, Wonsan, Nampo, Sariwon and dozens of Korean villages. Before leaving Korea, the investigation team held a press conference. The head of the investigation team, Mrs. Roede, said in a statement at the meeting: We have personally witnessed the terrible destruction suffered by this beautiful country, with towns and villages destroyed, and civilians ravaged and slaughtered. We will definitely tell the people of our country what we have seen. We believe that telling others what we have seen can help awaken our people to demand peace.

In response to questions raised by reporters, Austrian representative Plietecher said: "During the investigation here, we were reminded of the Nazis using poison gas to kill people in Maidanek and Auschwitz; however, in Korea, the Americans use fire to eliminate people, because fire is cheaper. We are convinced that the Americans are instigators of war, and we are also convinced that the Korean people are peace-loving people."

French representative Gillette Thiebaud-Gérin said: The members of the International Democratic Women's Federation investigation team will tell the people all over the world everything they have seen in Korea. She said, "Let the mothers of France and other countries know the truth about this war being waged in Korea, where people are being bombed to death, and soldiers from foreign countries are killing babies in cradles."

West German representative Wächter, Czech representative Svatosova, Dutch representative Heiligers, and Cuban representative Rodriguez all angrily denounced the atrocities of the American aggressors at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 31st: The International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on the atrocities of the US military in Korea arrived in Shenyang from Korea on the 30th. Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, and Park Dong-chu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Korean Cabinet, also accompanied them to Shenyang. Those who went to the station to welcome them included Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education of the Northeast People's Government, Li Zhenyong, Secretary-General of the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, Zhu Qiwu, Mayor of Shenyang, and representatives from various agencies, organizations, troops, and schools, totaling more than 1,000 people. Lu Cui, representative of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, also rushed from Beijing to Shenyang to welcome the investigation team.

　　国际妇联调查团离朝前发表声明
    决向全世界人民控诉美军暴行
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团，在朝鲜访问了新义州、平壤、江界、满浦镇、元山、南浦、沙里院等地以及数十处朝鲜乡村后，已胜利完成了调查任务。调查团在离朝前，曾举行记者招待会。调查团团长罗德夫人在会上发表声明说：我们亲眼看到了这个美丽的国家所遭到的可怖的破坏，城镇乡村被摧毁，平民遭受蹂躏和屠杀。我们一定将把我们所看见的情形告诉我们国家的人民。我们相信，我们把所看到的告诉别人，就可以帮助唤起我们的人民起来要求和平。
    在答复记者们所提出的问题时，奥地利代表普利屈特尔说：“在这里调查期间，我们想起纳粹在麦丹尼克和奥斯威齐姆用毒气毒死人民的情形；但是，在朝鲜，美国人用火来消灭人民，因为火更便宜。我们已确信美国人是战争煽动者，我们也确信朝鲜人民是爱好和平的人民。”
    法国代表日列特·季格尔利说：国际民主妇联调查团的团员们，当把她们在朝鲜所看到的一切去告诉全世界的老百姓。她说：“让法国的和其他各国的母亲们都知道在朝鲜进行的这种战争的真相，人民在那儿被炸死，从外国来的士兵们在那儿杀戮摇篮里的婴儿们。”
    西德代表瓦赫特、捷克代表斯瓦托索娃、荷兰代表海利格斯、古巴代表罗得利吉斯都在会上愤慨地控诉了美国侵略者的暴行。
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团于三十日自朝鲜到达沈阳。朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱、朝鲜内阁外务副相朴东楚也陪同来沈。前往车站欢迎者有东北人民政府教育部长车向忱、东北民主妇女联合会秘书长李振庸、沈阳市长朱其文及各机关、团体、部队、学校代表一千余人。中华全国民主妇女联合会代表陆璀也特由北京赶来沈阳欢迎调查团。
