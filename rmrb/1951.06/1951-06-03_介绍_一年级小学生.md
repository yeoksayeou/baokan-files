　　Introducing "First Grader"
    Ding Ling
    Recently, I read an extremely interesting book, and I felt completely drawn in; I was immersed in it. I felt like I had become small, almost the same age as the little girl Marusya, and I was living a supremely happy life full of youthful spring vitality with them. Everything around me was so harmonious, so immaculate. After finishing the book, I was reluctant to put it down, I thought about it from beginning to end, and then flipped through it again. I just want to tell everyone I meet to go and read it too. This book is "First Grader" written by the Soviet writer Schwarz.
    This is a screenplay. Its narrative is not dry and monotonous, but rather a series of lyrical scenes, with the characters vividly moving around. It is also a book for children to read, and every child can understand it. Even if our first or second graders can't completely recognize all the words in the book, they can understand it when it is read to them. Because our first and second graders will also encounter such things, and will have the same thoughts and actions as the little girl Marusya. This book tells us how Soviet children live a correct collective life, how to love others, how to listen to their grandmothers and mothers, how to be polite, how to help classmates, and how to correct their own shortcomings. It inspires our elementary school students to use their minds to think about everything they encounter. Like, what to do when encountering the fight-loving Seryozha? Do you dislike it when others are better than you? How can you be a good student? It inspires people to have more lovely ideals about life, and to use beautiful ideals to make their lives more joyful and perfect.
    I don't know how children will feel when they read this book, but I believe they will like it, because it really does write about children's own thoughts. For example, if you do a good job as a monitor, you will be respected and supported, and you will be reluctant to take off the armband; and when Marusya and her friends have finished the holiday, her mother and grandmother both thought she was asleep, so soundly asleep that even cannon fire wouldn't wake her up. But then, her mother quietly walked into her room and saw her sitting on the bed, intently reading a book her mother had given her - it was "Stories of Lenin." She was so happy to be able to read this book that she was reluctant to sleep and was lost in thought. She promised her mother: "Oh, good mother, I'll go to sleep right away! Just think about it a little more and then I'll sleep," "I'm thinking... if Lenin and Stalin, when they were little, lived in our house, how wonderful that would be. Right, good mother? They play in the yard. I'm with them..." "Mother, I know this is - wild thinking... but this thing is very interesting." She thought carefully and promised her mother, "I just don't know what to tell them to do... If they were still small, I would still tell them to do it... Vladimir Ilyich (honorific for Lenin), Joseph Vissarionovich (honorific for Stalin), right?" Seeing this, I laughed, and I laughed for a long time. I found it really interesting. Isn't this the thought of a naive and lovely child? If I were a child, I would think the same way.
    What makes this book so lovable is that everything it writes about are things that could happen in children's daily lives at any time, and everything appears so fresh and natural, and everything is resolved so well, with everyone inside being so kind, so amiable, and living with a purpose. Even the naughty Seryozha is lovable. Their relationships are also so appropriate, the mother is a good mother, and the teacher is a good teacher. The father is good, the botanist is good, the telegram deliverer, the carpenter, those extremely unimportant people in the book are also so interesting and lovable. Not to mention the little girls, they are all a group of lively little girls. They love, they are brave. They want spring to come to the classroom for an ideal, and they need a willow branch, so they venture to the woods outside the city, and they get lost there. Not only are they not afraid or crying, but they also learn to try their best not to be discouraged and to be close and united with each other.
    Adults can read this book too. Because adults like children, and adults still have a childlike heart. Reading it, they will also be reluctant to put it down. That's how I am.
    People who write fairy tales and people who write books for children should read this book even more, and they can learn a lot from it. We think that telling stories to children always involves cats and dogs, or swallows and sparrows, or even gods and ghosts, but that is not the case. Children like to hear about things that are close to their own lives, and they like to hear stories about themselves. We always think that we have to make up some bizarre, coincidental stories for them to love to listen to, but in fact, as long as we tell them about things in their lives and their own thoughts, that is interesting enough. "First Grader" has no story, it seems very plain, but it is very interesting and makes people want to think about it, that is because it writes about children, without writing children as adults. Children are obedient, children are well-behaved, and children understand many things, but they are still children. Every child can learn from these children and easily become a good child. It does not want children to learn from adults, or make children feel that learning to be good and well-behaved is a difficult thing.
    Editor's Note: The original author is Schwarz, the translator is Ren Rongrong, and it is published and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch. The film adapted from this book is "Happy Childhood", which is now being shown in various theaters in the capital.

### 介绍“一年级小学生”

　　介绍“一年级小学生”
    丁玲
    最近我读了一本极有趣味的书，我觉得我整个都被吸引住了，我沉醉在里面了。我觉得我变小了，同马鲁霞小姑娘差不多大，我正和她们一起过着极其幸福、充满春天的朝气的生活，我的四周都是那么谐和，那么一尘不染。我读完了这本书，还舍不得放手，我从头到尾去想它，再去翻它。我只想告诉凡是我碰到的人，要他们也去读它。这本书就是苏联施瓦尔茨著的“一年级小学生”。
    这是一个电影剧本。它的叙事不枯燥单调，而是一张张抒情的画面，人物是极生动地在那里活动。它又是一本给小孩子们读的书，个个小孩都看得懂。如果我们一年级或二年级的小学生不能完全认得书里面的字，但念给他们听，是可以听懂的。因为我们的一年级、二年级的小学生也会碰到这样的事，也会有马鲁霞小姑娘一样的想法和做法。这本书告诉我们：苏联孩子们怎样正确地过集体生活，怎样爱人，怎样听奶奶妈妈的话，怎样有礼貌，怎样帮助同学，怎样改正自己的缺点。它启发我们的小学生们怎样用思想，去思索一切所碰到的事。如同碰着爱打架的谢辽查，怎么样呢？自己是不是不喜欢旁人比自己好？自己怎样才可以做一个好学生呢？它启发人们对生活有更可爱的理想，而又以美好的理想来使自己生活得更愉快些，更完美些。
    我不知道孩子们读这本书会怎么样，但我相信孩子们是会喜欢它的，因为它写的的确是孩子们自己的想法。譬如做值日生做得好，便有人尊敬、拥护，就舍不得把袖章脱下咧；再如当马鲁霞和朋友们过完了节日以后，妈妈和奶奶都以为她睡着了，睡的连打炮也吵不醒的时候，妈妈轻轻走到她房里，却看见她坐在床上，专心专意在读一本她妈妈送给她的书。——那是一本《列宁的故事》。她高兴极了能读这本书，她舍不得睡，她胡思乱想。她答应她妈妈：“唉，好妈妈，马上就睡！再想一想就睡”，“我想的是……如果列宁和斯大林，当他们小的时候，住在我们的屋子里，那可多么好哇。对吗，好妈妈？他们在院子里玩。我跟他们在一块儿……妈妈，我知道这是——胡思乱想……可是这件事情非常有趣。”她细细地想，又答应她妈妈：“只是我不知叫他们做什么才好……如果他们还小，我一样叫他们做……弗拉基米尔·伊里奇（对列宁用的尊称），约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇（对斯大林的尊称），对吗？”看到这里我笑了，我笑了半天，我觉得真有味。这不是一个天真可爱的孩子的想法吗？我要是孩子，我也会这样想的。
    这本书使人爱读，就是它写的每件事都是孩子们日常生活里随时都可能发生的事，每件事都出现得那末新鲜那末自然，每件事又解决得那样好，那里边的人全那末和气，那末可亲，那末活得有目的。就连顽皮的谢辽查也是可爱的。他们的关系也是那末洽当，妈妈是好妈妈，教师是好教师。爸爸好，植物学家也好，送电报的啦，木匠啦，那些在书里极不重要的人也是那末有趣味、可爱。那些小姑娘就更不必说了，全是一群活泼的小姑娘。她们爱好，她们勇敢。他们为了一个理想，要春天来到教室里，需要一枝杨柳，她们便冒险到城外的树林子里去，她们迷失在那里。她们不但没有怕，不哭，而且还学会了大家尽力不垂头丧气，互相亲密团结。
    这本书大人一样可以读。因为大人是喜欢小孩子的，大人也还有童心。读起来一样也会舍不得丢开。我就是这样。
    写童话的人，为孩子们写书的人更要读这本书，从这本书里可以学到很多东西。我们以为给孩子们讲故事总离不开猫呀狗呀的，或者就是燕子、麻雀的，再不就是神仙鬼怪，其实不然。孩子最喜欢听和他们自己生活相近的事，喜欢听讲他们自己的故事。我们总以为要编一些离奇的、巧合的故事他们才爱听，其实只要讲出他们生活里面的事，他们自己的思想，这也就够有趣了。“一年级小学生”什么故事也没有，好像很平淡，但它却非常有趣味，使人耐想，那就是他写的是孩子，而没有把孩子写成大人。孩子听话，孩子乖，孩子懂得许多事，但还是一个孩子，每个孩子可以向这些孩子学习，很容易就成为一个好孩子。它不是要孩子学大人，或是使孩子感到学好、学乖是很困难的事。
    编者按：原书作者是施瓦尔茨，译者是任溶溶，新华书店华东总分店出版兼发行。此书改编的电影为《幸福童年》，现在首都各剧院正在放映。
