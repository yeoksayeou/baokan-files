The Shanghai Municipal and District Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committees recently assisted the People's Government in reviewing 663 counter-revolutionary cases, greatly helping the People's Government in handling counter-revolutionary issues.

The Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee reviews counter-revolutionary cases at both the municipal and district levels, employing methods such as full committee reviews, group reviews, and sending representatives to participate in jury trials and preliminary hearings in the People's Courts.

During the review meetings, the evidence, confessions, investigation materials, and case files of the relevant criminals are sent to the meeting venue by the public security and judicial organs. The responsible persons of the public security and judicial organs report on the case details one by one and propose preliminary opinions on how the public security and judicial organs intend to handle the cases. Then, the members review and discuss each case based on the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries."

All members of the Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee are very serious and responsible in reviewing each case. In the review work, many members repeatedly studied the handling of certain cases and actively expressed their opinions. For example, some members suggested that the government further investigate a complex case and collect supplementary materials. Some members suggested that the sentence in a case should be increased. For example, Chen Zhangshi, the wife of the local tyrant and secret agent Chen Xiaomao, was an accomplice of Chen Xiaomao. She not only used reactionary Taoist sects to carry out counter-revolutionary activities but also helped Chen Xiaomao rape more than 100 women. Therefore, many members believed that the original sentence of 15 years imprisonment was too lenient and suggested that the People's Government sentence her to death. When reviewing a batch of counter-revolutionaries arrested on April 27 this year, the Municipal Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee formed three groups, including industry and commerce, culture and education, and political parties, to conduct in-depth investigations among the masses and relevant units, collecting many specific supplementary materials on the evidence of the crimes of the cases being reviewed. The committee also suggested that the People's Government's public security and judicial organs should promptly handle some counter-revolutionary criminals with heinous crimes, blood debts, and great popular resentment, as well as individual counter-revolutionary elements with relatively minor crimes who could be placed under control. When the Municipal Public Security and Judicial Organs tried this batch of counter-revolutionary cases, the Municipal Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee appointed six members, Jiang Yong, Hu Ziying, Rong Yiren, Chen Renbing, Lu Yudao, and Yan Esheng, in two groups to participate in jury trials at the court. Hu Ziying reported the jury trial process to the Municipal Consultative Committee.

The Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee received assistance from the citizens in the course of its work. Many people took the initiative to provide evidence of the crimes of counter-revolutionary criminals and helped with investigations. When the Municipal Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee reviewed a batch of counter-revolutionary tyrant cases from May 25 to 28, many victims came to the Consultative Committee in person, pointing to the scars on their bodies and recounting the bloody crimes of the counter-revolutionary tyrants against them.

The Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Judicial Organs attached great importance to the review opinions of the Municipal and District Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committees on counter-revolutionary cases and promptly submitted them to the Shanghai Military Control Commission for approval along with the case verdicts.

After reviewing the counter-revolutionary cases, the members had a deeper understanding of the correctness of the People's Government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Kui Yanfang said: "After participating in the work of reviewing counter-revolutionary cases, I have a deeper understanding of the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements and the seriousness of their harm to the people, which proves that it is entirely necessary to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries." Wang Yunsheng said: "The People's Government has completely correctly implemented the policy of combining suppression with leniency stipulated by Chairman Mao." He cited an example: In the "Shunzheng Kingdom Emperor" case, a huge armed secret service organization reviewed by the Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee, one-third of the criminals with heinous crimes were sentenced to death, while the remaining criminals with lighter crimes were sentenced to imprisonment or placed under people's control. Chen Renbing said in a work report on behalf of the Municipal and District Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committees to the Second Enlarged Joint Conference of People's Representatives from all walks of life in the city and districts: "After we have reviewed so many cases, we trust the government more and thank the Central People's Government and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government. From the review of the cases, we also know more clearly that the People's Government has not wronged a single good person."

Note: The Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committees of the Shanghai Municipal and District People's Representative Conference Consultative Committees were established in late April, with 35 members in the municipal-level review committee and 13 to 27 members in the district-level review committees. These members represented democratic parties, workers, peasants, youth, women, industry and commerce, culture and education, religion, and other sectors of the people, and included representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers.

　　上海市反革命案件审查委员会怎样协助政府处理反革命问题
    上海市市、区两级反革命案件审查委员会最近曾协助人民政府审查了六百六十三件反革命案件，对人民政府处理反革命问题有很大的帮助。
    反革命案件审查委员会审查反革命案件，分市、区两级审查，采用了大会审查、小组审查以及派代表到人民法庭参加陪审、预审等方式。
    在开会审查时，有关各案犯的证据、供状、调查材料的卷宗等，都由公安、司法机关送到会场，并由公安、司法机关的负责人逐件报告案情，提出公安、司法机关拟予处理的初步意见；然后由各委员根据《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》进行审查和讨论。
    反革命案件审查委员会全体委员，对每一案件的审查都非常认真负责。在审查工作中，有不少委员对若干案件的处理反复研究，积极地发表意见。如有的委员提出某一案件情况复杂，建议政府再加以调查，搜集补充材料；有的委员提出某一案件判刑应该加重。例如恶霸特务陈小毛之妻陈张氏，是陈小毛的帮凶，她不但利用反动道会门进行反革命活动，而且帮助陈小毛强奸了一百多名妇女；因此，不少委员认为原判该犯十五年徒刑太轻，建议人民政府将其判处死刑。市反革命案件审查委员会在审查今年四月二十七日逮捕的一批反革命案犯时，曾组成工商、文教、党派等三个小组，到群众中及有关单位进行深入的调查工作，对所审查的案犯的罪证，搜集到许多具体的补充材料。该委员会并建议人民政府公安、司法机关，将若干罪恶深重、血债累累、民愤很大的反革命罪犯及个别罪恶较轻、可予管制的反革命分子，尽先迅速处理。在市公安、司法机关审理这批反革命案件时，市反革命案件审查委员会又推定江庸、胡子婴、荣毅仁、陈仁炳、卢于道、严谔声等六委员分两组到法院参加陪审，并由胡子婴委员向市协商委员会报告陪审经过。
    反革命案件审查委员会在工作过程中获得了市民群众的协助。许多人主动地提供反革命罪犯的罪证材料和帮助调查。市反革命案件审查委员会在五月二十五日至二十八日审查一批反革命恶霸案件时，有不少苦主亲到协商委员会，指着他们身上的伤痕，诉说反革命恶霸残害他们的血腥罪行。
    上海市公安、司法机关对市、区反革命案件审查委员会关于反革命案件的审查意见非常重视，并迅速地连同案件判决书呈请上海市军事管制委员会批核。
    经过审查反革命案件后，各委员更深刻地认识了人民政府镇压反革命政策的正确。蒉延芳说：“我参加了审查反革命案件的工作之后，使我更深刻地认识了反革命分子的罪恶及其危害人民的严重性，这证明严厉镇压反革命是完全必要的。”王芸生说：“人民政府是完全正确地执行了毛主席所规定的镇压与宽大相结合的政策的。”他并举例说：经反革命案件审查委员会审查的巨大武装特务组织“顺政国皇帝”案中，全部罪犯中有三分之一罪大恶极的分子判处了死刑，其余罪恶较轻的则分别判处徒刑或交人民管制。陈仁炳在代表市、区反革命案件审查委员会向市、区各界人民代表第二次扩大联席会议作工作报告时说：“我们审查了这么多的案件以后，我们更加信任政府，感谢中央人民政府和上海市人民政府。从审查案件中，我们也更确实地知道人民政府没有冤枉一个好人。”
    按：上海市市、区两级各界人民代表会议协商委员会的反革命案件审查委员会是在四月底先后成立的，市级审查委员为三十五人；区级审查委员会，委员自十三人至二十七人不等。这些委员代表了各民主党派、工人、农民及青年、妇女、工商、文教、宗教等各界人民，并有革命烈士家属及革命军人家属代表参加。（新华社）
