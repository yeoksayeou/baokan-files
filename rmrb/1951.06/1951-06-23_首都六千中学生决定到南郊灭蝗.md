　　Six Thousand Middle School Students in the Capital Decide to Eliminate Locusts in the Southern Suburbs

　　After learning that a serious locust plague had occurred in the southern suburbs, the Bureau of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and the Student Federation immediately convened a meeting of the principals, deans, and student union chairmen of eleven middle schools in Beijing. Everyone decided to spare two days starting on the 23rd, sending six thousand male and female students to the locust-affected areas to cooperate with local farmers in eliminating the locusts. It was also resolved that after the students go to the countryside, they must cooperate closely with the farmers, pay attention to mass discipline and customs, and use their rest time to carry out propaganda on resisting America, aiding Korea, and increasing production for national patriotism to the masses. To facilitate command, a Locust Eradication Headquarters was organized, with Hou Junyan, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, as the General Captain, and Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Municipal Student Federation, as the Deputy General Captain. Each middle school formed a brigade headquarters organized by the school principal, the Dean's office, the General Affairs office, the Communist Youth League branch, and the Student Union. The principal or dean served as the brigade captain, and the chairman of the Student Union served as the deputy brigade captain. Fifty people formed a company, and ten people formed a squad. Each company had three or four people as medics and liaisons. The students brought their own dry food and locust-killing tools for two days.

　　The Beijing Railway Bureau specially prepared train cars for these six thousand students. The Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, in order to take care of the students' safety, also decided to send two ambulances to accompany the students to the locust-affected areas to eliminate locusts.

　　首都六千中学生决定到南郊灭蝗
    农牧局与学联得悉南郊发生严重蝗灾，即招集北京市十一个中学校长、教导主任、学生会主席开会。大家决定于二十三日开始挤出两天时间，派六千男女同学到蝗区，协同当地农民，扑灭蝗虫。并决议同学下乡后，一定要与农民亲密合作，注意群众纪律与风俗习惯，利用休息时间向群众做抗美援朝爱国增产的宣传。为便于指挥，组织了灭蝗总队部，选文教局副局长侯俊岩为总队长，市学联主席古奇踪为副总队长，各中学由学校校长、教导处、总务处、青年团支部、学生会组织成大队部。校长或教导主任为大队长，学生会主席为副大队长。五十人为一中队，十人为一小队。中队内设卫生员、联络员三、四人。同学们自带两天干粮及扑蝗工具。
    北京铁路分局专门给这六千同学准备了车皮。北京市卫生局为了照顾同学的安全起见，也决定派二辆救护车，随同学去蝗区灭蝗。
