Shenyang Factory's Fourteenth Workshop
    Regularized Political Education for Workers
    Continuous Improvement in Production Efficiency
    The regularization of political education for workers in the Fourteenth Workshop of a state-owned factory in Shenyang has been achieved by resolving three key issues under the unified leadership of the workshop's Communist Party branch. First, integrating propaganda and education work with production work; second, adhering to several systems for propaganda and education work; and third, maintaining unified steps between the Party, administration, labor union, and Youth League. For example, when the workshop was formulating advanced quotas for a certain product, conservative thinking existed among the workers. The workshop's Communist Party branch combined the propaganda against the American armament of Japan with the work of setting advanced quotas, making workers understand that improving labor organization and operation methods was a practical action against the American armament of Japan. As a result, workers who recognized this created new records with more than three times the original production efficiency, ensuring the smooth completion of the advanced quota setting. The Communist Party branch's propagandists are normally able to conduct various education on current affairs and politics for the workers regularly according to the system. The twice-weekly collective newspaper reading is also uninterrupted and has been very effective. Once, when the newspaper reader read a dispatch about a soldier of the People's Volunteer Army who killed nine American soldiers with only twelve bullets, the workers were deeply moved. They believed that the Volunteer Army was so economical in fighting on the battlefield, and they should be even more economical in production in the factory. Therefore, the workers of the entire workshop immediately strived to save machine oil. The machine oil consumption that day was reduced from 0.9 kilograms to 0.3 kilograms. The workshop's Communist Party branch secretary, Youth League branch secretary, workshop administrative director, and workshop labor union chairman are all Communist Party propagandists, so they can promptly understand the ideological problems of the workers and exchange opinions on solving these problems at their daily meetings. Therefore, propaganda and education work can be carried out in a unified manner, with concentrated strength.
    Before February of this year, due to irregular propaganda work, the political enthusiasm of most workers in the workshop was not high enough, and the production situation was often slack in the first half of the month and a rush in the second half of the month. Since the regularization of propaganda and education work in February, although the workshop added many new product manufacturing tasks in February, the entire month's task was still completed one day ahead of schedule. Although the production task in March increased by 60% compared to February, it was completed in only nineteen days.

### 沈阳某工厂第十四车间  工人政治教育经常化  生产效率不断提高

　　沈阳某工厂第十四车间        
    工人政治教育经常化       
    生产效率不断提高
    沈阳某国营工厂第十四车间的工人政治教育工作已做到经常化，这是因为在中共车间支部的统一领导下解决了三个问题。第一，宣传教育工作和生产工作结合起来；第二，坚持了宣传教育工作的若干制度；第三，党、政、工、团步调一致。例如该车间制订某种产品的先进定额时，工人当中存在着保守思想。车间中共支部就把反对美国武装日本的宣传和制订先进定额的工作结合起来，使工人们了解到改进劳动组织和改进操作方法就是反对美国武装日本的实际行动。结果，认识到这一点的工人创造了比原来生产效率提高三倍以上的新纪录，使先进定额的制订顺利完成。共产党支部的宣传员平常都能按制度经常向工人群众进行有关时事政治的各种教育。每周两次的集体读报也从不间断，并且收效很大。有一次，当读报员读了人民志愿军的一位战士只用十二颗子弹就打死了九个美国兵的通讯后，工人们很受感动。他们认为志愿军在战场打仗还那样节约，自己在工厂生产就更应该节约。于是，全车间工人马上努力节省机器用油。当天机器用油就由零点九公斤减至零点三公斤。该车间中共支部书记、青年团支部书记、车间行政主任和车间工会主席都是共产党的宣传员，所以他们在每天的碰头会上都能及时互相了解工人群众的思想问题并交换关于解决这些问题的意见，因此宣传教育工作就能步调一致，力量集中。
    今年二月以前，该车间因宣传工作不经常，大部分工人的政治热情不够高涨，生产情况往往是上半月松懈，下半月突击。自二月宣传教育工作经常化后，该车间二月份虽然增加了很多制造新产品的任务，但全月任务仍能提前一天完成。三月份的生产任务虽比二月份增加了百分之六十，结果只用了十九天就全部完成了。
