　　(II) The Work of Giving Special Care to Entitled Groups Must Be Regularized
　　The call to action about doing a good job in giving special care to entitled groups in this association's June 1st Communique has now been met with a response from people in all areas, and the work of giving special care to entitled groups in many places has seen new progress. The leadership organs of all areas should guide the enthusiasm of the people in loving the motherland and loving the people's army toward regularization, and strictly prevent the recurrence of the tendency of treating the work of giving special care to entitled groups as a sudden, concentrated task. Generally speaking, in the past, governments and the people in all areas have paid attention to the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and there have been achievements. The most significant shortcoming is the lack of regularity. In quite a few places, the following situation has occurred: when movements like joining the army, supporting the army, and giving preferential treatment to the families of military personnel arrive, the work of giving special care to entitled groups is carried out in a lively manner, but once the movement ends, it slackens off to varying degrees. More seriously, with the victorious development of the revolutionary situation, cadres and the masses in quite a few places have fostered ideas of complacency, thus neglecting the work of giving special care to entitled groups. They do not understand that the people's own armed forces (including the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the People's Public Security Forces) were, are, and will continue to be the main guarantee of our people's happy life and the independence and security of our people's own country. As long as imperialism exists in the world for one day, our people's army must be strengthened for one day, and national defense must be consolidated for one day. Precisely because they do not understand these fundamental principles, they naturally do not understand the importance of doing a consistently good job of giving special care to entitled groups. Now, we should overcome the above-mentioned incorrect understanding among cadres and the masses through in-depth patriotic education, and establish the idea of consistently doing a good job of giving special care to entitled groups. We must not only seek a temporary and sensational form, but also prevent the tendency of being satisfied with some achievements and not seeking to do a consistently good job of giving special care to entitled groups. In short, we must make this movement a turning point for us to further improve the work of giving special care to entitled groups in the future.
　　In order to regularize the work of giving special care to entitled groups, people's organizations in all areas should assist the government in establishing a regular system for inspecting the work of giving special care to entitled groups. In order to make this work a mass movement, the work of giving special care to entitled groups must be incorporated into the patriotic pacts formulated by the masses of all relevant units, because only in this way can the people constantly remember that doing a good job of giving special care to entitled groups is one of their important patriotic responsibilities that they should fulfill, thereby consistently and actively doing a good job of giving special care to entitled groups. All areas that have not yet incorporated doing a good job of giving special care to entitled groups into patriotic pacts should mobilize the masses to supplement and revise the patriotic pacts, and list the work of giving special care to entitled groups as one of the important contents; those who have already done so should mobilize the masses at any time to check the implementation of this content and other contents in the patriotic pacts. In rural areas, in conjunction with the bumper harvest movement, the work of farming on behalf of military families should be checked in a timely manner; in cities, the focus should be on checking the work of helping the families of military personnel and revolutionary martyrs to find employment, and problems should be promptly resolved as soon as they are discovered.

  （二）必须使优抚工作经常化
    本会六月一日文告中关于做好优抚工作的号召，现已获得各地人民的响应，许多地方的优抚工作已有新的进展。各地领导机关应该把人民群众这种爱护祖国、爱护人民军队的热情引向经常化，严防把优抚工作当成一个突击任务偏向的再次发生。一般说，过去各地政府和人民是注意优待烈属军属的工作的，而且是有成绩的。最主要的缺点，是经常性不够。曾经有不少地方发生过这样的情形：当参军、拥护军队、优待军属等运动到来的时候，优抚工作搞得热火朝天，但运动一结束，便又或多或少地松懈下来了。更严重的是，随着革命形势的胜利发展，有不少地方的干部和群众，滋长了太平观念，因而忽视了优抚工作。他们不了解：人民自己的武装部队（包括人民解放军、人民志愿军和人民公安部队）过去是、现在是、将来也是我们人民的幸福生活和人民自己的国家的独立安全的主要保障，只要世界上一天有帝国主义存在，我们人民的军队便也一天不能不加强；国防便也一天不能不巩固。正因为他们不了解这些根本的道理，所以他们就自然不了解优抚工作必须经常做好的重要性。现在我们应该通过深入的爱国主义教育，来克服干部和群众中的上述不正确的认识，树立起经常地做好优抚工作的思想。我们一定不要只图形式上的一时轰轰烈烈，更要防止满足于些许成绩而不求把优抚工作经常做好的偏向。总之，我们一定要使这次运动成为我们今后进一步做好优抚工作的转折点。
    为了使优抚工作经常化，各地人民团体应协助政府建立起经常的检查优抚工作的制度来。为着使这一工作成为群众运动，必须把优抚工作订入一切有关单位的群众所订立的爱国公约之内，因为只有如此，才能使人民群众时时刻刻记着做好优抚工作是自己应尽的重要爱国责任之一，从而经常积极地做好优抚工作。各地凡是还没有把做好优抚工作订入爱国公约的，都应该发动群众补充修订爱国公约，把优抚工作列为其中重要内容之一；已经这样作了的，要随时发动群众随时检查爱国公约中的这项内容以及其他内容的执行情况。在农村应该结合丰产运动，及时检查代耕工作，在城市，应着重检查帮助军属烈属就业的工作，发现问题都要及时加以解决。
