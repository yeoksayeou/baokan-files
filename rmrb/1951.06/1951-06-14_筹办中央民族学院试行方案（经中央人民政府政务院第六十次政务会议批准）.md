　　Provisional Plan for Preparing the Central Institute for Nationalities
    (Approved by the 60th Government Affairs Council Meeting of the Central People's Government)
    (1) The tasks of the Central Institute for Nationalities:
    (1) To cultivate high-level and mid-level cadres for the implementation of regional autonomy and the development of political, economic, and cultural construction in various ethnic minorities in China.
    (2) To study the problems of ethnic minorities in China, as well as the languages, scripts, history, culture, social economy of various ethnic minorities, and to promote and introduce the excellent historical culture of various ethnic groups.
    (3) To organize and lead the editing and translation work related to ethnic minorities.
    (2) Currently, the military and political cadre training class, the undergraduate political science and language departments will be established first. If necessary, primary and secondary schools for children of ethnic minority cadres can be attached.
    (1) The military and political cadre training class, which is a short-term political training class, enrolls various personnel from all ethnic groups equivalent to section chiefs and district heads at the county level and above, as well as cadres above the battalion level in the army, or patriotic democratic figures within the scope of the county level and above, for a period of four to six months. If the general training method is not applicable to individual ethnic minority individuals, more flexible teaching methods can be adopted and the training period can be shortened.
    (2) The undergraduate political science department will use two years (those with lower levels will first enter a preparatory course for half a year or a year) to cultivate revolutionary backbones of various ethnic groups, and enroll students who meet the following conditions:
    1. Those who voluntarily study again after the above-mentioned short-term training.
    2. Those who have participated in revolutionary struggles and worked for more than two years.
    3. Young people of all ethnic groups who have indeed graduated from junior high school or above, or who have the equivalent academic ability.
    (3) The language department enrolls Han students who have graduated from high school or above and are willing to work with ethnic minorities, as well as ethnic minority students with considerable academic ability, to specialize in the languages of various ethnic minorities, and graduate in two years.
    (4) The attached primary and secondary schools enroll the children of ethnic minority military and political personnel and cadres, teach in the languages of various ethnic groups, and must learn Chinese.
    (3) Teaching methods of the Central Institute for Nationalities: For advanced students, lectures are the main method, supplemented by self-study, discussions, and extracurricular activities. For lower-level students, lectures and reviews are the main methods, supplemented by self-study, discussions, and extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities include social activities, internships, visits, tours, cultural entertainment, etc., and should be included in the education plan.
    (4) Establish a research department. The research department is divided into several research offices according to ethnicity or several relatively close ethnicities. As much as possible, the appropriate talents who are currently studying relevant issues in various universities and parts of the country should be concentrated in the Institute for Nationalities.
    (5) In the initial stage of its establishment, the Central Institute for Nationalities is led by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. After a certain period, it will be led by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and guided by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government.
