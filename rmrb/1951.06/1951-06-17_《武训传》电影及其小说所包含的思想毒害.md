　　The discussion about "The Life of Wu Xun" and the views on Wu Xun are a political test and a fierce ideological struggle. In this test and this struggle, the serious and alarming fact that various non-proletarian ideologies (especially bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts) are terribly eroding the revolutionary camp has been exposed. In order to gradually eliminate the anti-historical and anti-people ideological toxins and raise the ideological and theoretical levels a step further, we should indeed enthusiastically respond to the call of the People's Daily, attach importance to and participate in the discussion and criticism of Wu Xun, and conduct extensive propaganda and education among the masses.

　　Who Wu Xun actually was and what role he played in history is very clear. His character of mediocrity and despicable nature, and his behavior of baseness and shame are also very obvious. However, Mr. Sun Yu, the director and screenwriter of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," said: "He persistently and unyieldingly struggled with the feudal rulers for his entire life." He "wholeheartedly served the people." "He typically embodies the noble qualities of diligence, courage, and wisdom of our Chinese nation."

　　Mr. Zhao Dan, the main actor in the film, also said:

　　"…Wu Xun's struggle reflects the indomitable spirit of the Chinese peasants. This will is the will of a labor hero. Precisely because of this, even the reactionary class at the time (even those who directly harmed him) fearfully acknowledged his success, and thus he became the central figure of that time…"

　　Such praise for Wu Xun and the so-called "Spirit of Wu Xun" is completely wrong. How can someone as shameless, ridiculous, and detestable as Wu Xun be associated with steadfastness and unyielding struggle? What common ground do his servile flattery and ignorance have with courage, wisdom, nobility, and greatness? After he wholeheartedly surrendered to the ruling class, what relationship did he have with the hardworking and kind working people?

　　Although Mr. Sun Yu once said that he adopted "simultaneous praise and criticism" towards Wu Xun, in fact, the main emphasis is still on commendation, still on praise. Criticism is only insignificant, and even plays a role in praising the "Spirit of Wu Xun" from the opposite perspective. In order to achieve the purpose of praising, they also forcibly imposed progressive thoughts and actions such as "anti-landlord," "anti-local tyrant," and "anti-feudal system" on Wu Xun, attempting to beautify and idealize this ugly image. This is very wrong.

　　Mr. Zhao Dan said that the reason he wanted to commend Wu Xun was to "pull him back from the encirclement of the feudal landlord class, the scholar-official class, and the bourgeoisie to the masses of the people." This is also a somewhat naive idea, because in fact, although Wu Xun had worked as a hired laborer before, afterwards, his main occupations were so-called "begging" and performing tricks. He had basically separated himself from labor and become a "free" vagrant. Occasionally doing odd jobs cannot change this status. He did not understand class hatred and active resistance. To wholeheartedly and devotedly serve the ruling class like him—promoting feudal culture—and forcibly "pull him back" and count him as a member of the masses of the people, the only way to do so is to clothe him in a progressive guise. What kind of image do we see in the movies, novels, and illustrated biographies:

　　"Heavy footsteps came out of the main room, followed by Zhang Juren's mammy Qian. Wu Xun heard Zhou Da yell 'Master!', his knees trembled in fright. Mammy Qian shouted again, 'Come over here!' He was like a tiny pilgrim going to worship Buddha, not daring to even look up at the Buddha statue from below. His legs involuntarily knelt down on the stone steps.

　　"While Juren was staring with eyes wide, his nose twitching like a donkey, Wu Xun dared not look up straight but lowered his head. He only heard a thunderous sound above his head, and drizzling rain poured down. He felt that everything from the moment he entered Juren's door until now was fresh, difficult to understand, and astonishing. Juren is really different from us poor people!

　　'Get up quickly! What are you still kneeling here for!' Mammy Qian's voice was calling to him. When he looked up, Juren's shadow had disappeared. Zhou Da helped him up with a laugh, but his legs were already numb and weak, and he was about to fall." (Movie Novel, pages 47, 48)

　　Is such a clown and slave the son of the working people and a true typical or outstanding representative of the working people?

　　Some people still look at labor abstractly, thinking that it is glorious, sacred, pleasant, and worthy of praise to labor for anyone. Little do they know that this is precisely the viewpoint welcomed by feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie and harmful to the working people; this is 100% slave philosophy, because only those blinded by this philosophy can see hell as paradise, see pain as art, and be content and at ease no matter how oppressed and exploited they are. Unexpectedly, some people who claim to be looking at problems from a new perspective also have such views. I think this is clearly influenced by the ideology of the landlord bourgeoisie and should be pointed out.

　　This slave philosophy is expressed in a rather clever and hidden way in the movie novel "The Life of Wu Xun":

　　"Making the world laugh is much better than making the world cry.

　　Thus, Wu Xun bravely chose a path within his capabilities, appearing as a clown on the streets of feudal society in the late Qing Dynasty, ready to accept any hardship and ridicule, wanting to fight for a better life for the poor and strive for educational opportunities for the next generation through his personal tragic resistance. From his tearful smiling eyes, we see Wu Xun—the child of the working people—possessing a sincere and unparalleled love for his proletarian brethren who share the same fate." (Page 26)

　　From this passage, we can see that the author's understanding of concepts such as labor and working people, the proletariat and the peasant masses, is abstract, hollow, ambiguous, and vague. If the "world" mentioned here does not refer to landlords, gentry, and bureaucrats, but to the masses of the people, then what educational significance does it have? How can we ask the peasants, who are groaning on the brink of death under heavy oppression, plunder, and exploitation, not to cry but to be angry, not to be sad but to rise up, but to be like Wu Xun, a slave who has lost all class consciousness and never awakens until death, to sing while doing hard labor, smile when being whipped, kowtow to express gratitude when praised, and be flattered and overwhelmed by favors?

　　The film certainly depicts the cruelty and injustice, insidiousness and baseness of Zhang Juren and his lackeys Zhao Xiong and Wei Jun, and the local bully Gao Chunshan and his lackey Liu Si, but it also emphasizes the public-spiritedness, enlightenment, and integrity of Yang Shufang, Lou Junling, Guo Fen, etc. This is both exposing and praising the ruling class, writing about both darkness and light. The author attempts to emphasize both exposure and praise, but in fact, he achieves the effect of praise completely. "Half and half" is impossible.

　　The film has a theme song, and its lyrics are:

　　"A bag and a bowl, traveling in dust and wind. A brick and a tile, accumulating into gold. Performing arts on the street, selling songs in the market. Being an ox and a horse, sacrificing life and body. How thin is the social atmosphere? The mainland is sinking. Who enlightens my ignorance? Who relieves my poverty? Great is Wu Xun, supremely brave and benevolent. Begging to promote education, a unique person throughout the ages."

　　The main theme of this movie is to praise Wu Xun's arduous and extraordinary behavior and eulogize his career and success. This theme song is an excellent illustration of this. I believe that unconditionally praising Wu Xun's "hardworking style" and "fighting spirit" is actually a concrete manifestation of abstract "human nature theory."

　　Using a tumbler to symbolize Wu Xun's "strong character," using a fantasy journey to hell to narrate Wu Xun's process of "great enlightenment," and using the words of a female teacher in a winter school after liberation to "criticize" Wu Xun's methods and point out his failure, are not only far-fetched but also harmful because they further blur the masses' understanding.

　　Some people often excuse Wu Xun by citing the limitations of historical conditions, but the facts are absolutely unfavorable to this kind of defense. Because the Taiping Army of the Northern Expedition, led by Li Kaifang, attacked Shandong in 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng). At this time, Wu Xun was sixteen years old. In 1865 (the fourth year of Tongzhi), the Nian Army led by Lai Wenguang also defeated the Qing army in Shandong, killing the Qing commander Senggelinqin, shaking the Manchu Dynasty. At this time, Wu Xun was twenty-seven years old and already an adult. Even without mentioning other vigorous and moving people's revolutionary movements against foreign invaders and domestic reactionary feudal rule, these two great revolutionary advances alone should have had some impact on Wu Xun and made him realize something. However, Wu Xun showed no sign of such awareness at all, and had no thoughts or actions to resist the ruling class and liberate himself. Instead, he increasingly moved towards the path of surrender. This is precisely an illustration of his complete slave nature and submissive character. It is true that the film depicts a Taiping Army soldier named Zhou Da, but this is a distorted character and cannot represent the characteristics of Taiping Army soldiers. The author brings him on stage only to highlight Wu Xun's greatness and to insult the Chinese peasant revolution. In the movie novel, there is the following passage that is sufficient to prove this:

　　"Kill? ... In the legends and stories that Wu Xun had heard from the elders, from Li Chuangwang and the peasants under his command forcing the Chongzhen Emperor of the late Ming Dynasty to hang himself on Coal Hill, to Wang Lun, the leader of the Shandong poor people who once occupied Tangyi, Shouchang, and Yanggu counties eighty years ago, all ended in utter defeat. Hong Xiuquan established his capital in Nanjing five years ago, forgetting the poor. I heard that in the past two years, those who have been defeated have been defeated, and those who have been captured have been captured. The two lakes and Jiangxi have all fallen into the hands of Zeng Guofan's Xiang Army. It seems that the general trend is over... What is the use of killing?"

　　I think this is definitely not the thoughts and emotions of ordinary peasants at the time, especially conscious peasants, but a complete mood of defeat and slave thoughts against the peasant uprising. The author may want to use Wu Xun's peace and obedience to criticize his mistakes from the opposite perspective, but in fact, the basic spirit and nature of this work not only fundamentally negate this ambiguous and weak criticism, but also further increase the confusion and negativity of the theme. After reading Zhou Da's reply to Wu Xun, one can understand even more:

　　"Zhou Da stared at Wu Xun and patted Wu Xun's shoulder, saying:
　　"Good, Wu Qi! You use literature, and I use force. Let's use both literature and force to let those dog officials and local tyrants know that our common people are not to be bullied!" (Pages 135, 136)

　　Through Zhou Da's mouth, the author clearly affirmed and approved of the path Wu Xun took, as if Wu Xun's path and the path of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom could coexist, harmonize with each other, and complement each other. But in reality, he unconsciously and emphatically promoted the victory and success of surrenderism. This is certainly not a faithful depiction of history.

　　The public release of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the praise for Wu Xun clearly adopted an incorrect attitude and violated the direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao. I think that since we are called new democratic literary and art workers, we should not lose the standpoint of the masses of the people, and Communist Party members should especially stand firm on the Party's standpoint. Some people say that although the ideology of "The Life of Wu Xun" is not correct, and it has committed serious errors in politics, its artistry is quite high, especially Mr. Zhao Dan's portrayal of Wu Xun is very successful. However, these people just happen to forget that artistic standards should be placed second, should be subordinate to political standards, and form should be subordinate to content. Moreover, the more reactionary the content and the more confused or erroneous the political ideology of a work is, the more artistic it is, the more it will poison the people, and the more it should be rejected. We should oppose praising any enemy, praising any ugly social phenomenon, and should oppose praising the slave spirit and kowtowing in any way. Our nation is a great nation, and our people are a great people. The slave spirit and kowtowing are definitely not our tradition, and the dregs who only know how to kneel, kowtow, bend their knees, and surrender are definitely not our ancestors. If we do not draw clear lines, distinguish between love and hate, praise those who deserve to be praised, and resolutely expose those who should be exposed, it will inevitably cause ideological confusion, mislead the masses, and lead them astray. I believe that only in this way can we gradually improve our theoretical level and ideological level, firmly implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, and better help literary and art workers obtain correct historical views and class views, labor views and people's views, help them correctly represent historical typical figures and typical events, and truly represent "the noble qualities of diligence, courage, and wisdom of our Chinese nation."

　　I firmly believe that doing so is completely necessary and absolutely beneficial to everyone because this is a serious ideological struggle.

　　《武训传》电影及其小说所包含的思想毒害
    何家槐
    关于《武训传》的讨论和对于武训的看法，是一个政治的考验，也是一场激烈的思想斗争。在这个考验和这场斗争中，暴露了各种非无产阶级意识（尤其是资产阶级和小资产阶级思想）正可怕地侵蚀着革命阵营这一严重的、值得大家警惕的事实。为了逐步肃清反历史反人民的思想毒素，把思想水平和理论水平提高一步，我们的确应该热烈响应人民日报的号召，重视和参加有关武训的讨论和批判，向群众进行广泛的宣传和教育。
    武训究竟是什么人，在历史上究竟扮演了一种什么角色，是很清楚的，他的性格之庸懦可鄙和行为之卑污可耻，也是很显然的；但电影《武训传》的编导孙瑜先生却说：“他坚韧地，百折不挠地和封建统治者作了一生一世的斗争”他“全心全意为人民服务”“他典型地表现了我们中华民族勤劳、勇敢、和智慧的崇高品质”。
    这个影片的主要演员赵丹先生也说：
    “………武训这种斗争反映中国农民的顽强不屈的精神，这意志是劳动英雄的意志，正因为这样，所以连当时的反动阶级（甚至直接残害过他的人）都胆颤心惊的承认了他的成功，因而就成为当时的中心人物……”
    这样赞美武训和所谓“武训精神”，是完全错误的。像武训那样的寡廉鲜耻，可笑可憎，怎么能与坚贞不屈，顽强斗争联系起来？像他那样的奴颜媚骨，愚昧无知，与勇敢智慧，崇高伟大究竟有什么共同之点？自他死心塌地地投降了统治阶级之后，与勤苦善良的劳动人民又有什么关系呢？
    孙瑜先生虽则曾说他对于武训是“歌颂与批判并行”，但事实上，主要的却仍然是表扬，仍然是赞美，批判只是极不足道的，甚至起了从反面来歌颂“武训精神”的作用。为了达到歌颂的目的，他们还把什么“反地主”，“反恶霸”，“反封建制度”等等进步思想和行动，一古脑儿地硬加在武训身上，企图把这丑恶的形象美化和理想化，这是非常错误的。
    赵丹先生说他之所以要表扬武训，原是要把他“从封建地主阶级，士大夫阶级，以及资产阶级的包围中拉回到人民大众中来”。这也是有些近乎天真的想法，因为事实上，武训先前虽曾当过长工，但以后主要的却是以所谓“行乞”和耍把戏为生，基本上已经脱离了劳动，变成了“自由自在”的游民，偶尔打打零工，并不能改变这一成份。他不懂得阶级仇恨和积极抗争。像他那样忠心耿耿鞠躬尽瘁地为统治阶级服务——宣扬封建文化，要把他“拉回来”硬算做人民大众中的一员，是除了给他披上进步的外衣，是别无他法的。在电影，小说，和画传中，我们看到的是什么形象呢：
    “沉重的脚步从上房里走了出来，张举人身后随着了钱妈。武训耳听着周大叫了一声‘老爷’，他的双膝吓得发颤。钱妈又在喊‘过来罢！’他像一个渺小的朝山进香者，从低处连佛像都不敢抬眼一望，两条腿不由自主地在石级上跪了下去。
    “武训在举人老爷瞪着眼，鼻子像驴子一掀一掀的当口，已经不敢再正视上望而低下了头，只听得头上一声雷震，毛毛雨沛然而下。他觉得他从举人老爷的大门算起，一直到现在，没有一件事不新鲜，难懂，而又惊人。举人老爷可真和俺们穷人不同啊！
    ‘快起来罢！还老是跪在这儿干什么呀！’钱大娘的声音在向他喊着。他抬起头来的时候，举人老爷的影子已经不见。周大笑着扶他起来，他的两条腿已经麻痹无力、摇摇欲倒了。”（电影小说四七、四八页）
    这样的一个丑角和奴才，是什么劳动人民的儿子和劳动人民的真实典型或优秀代表呢？
    有些人至今还是抽象地来看劳动，以为替谁劳动都是光荣的，神圣的，愉快的，值得歌颂的，殊不知这正是为封建地主和资产阶级所欢迎而对劳动人民有害的观点；这正是百分之百的奴隶哲学，因为只有为这种哲学所蒙蔽的人才能把地狱看成乐园，把痛苦看成艺术，不论如何遭受压迫和剥削，也能安分守己，处之泰然。不料有些自命为以新观点来看问题的人，也有如此的看法。我以为这明明是受了地主资产阶级思想的影响，是应该加以指出的。
    这一奴隶哲学，在电影小说《武训传》中有着相当巧妙的，隐蔽的表现：
    “逗得世人笑了——究竟比叫世人流泪好得多。
    于是武训就这样勇敢地选择了自己能力范围内的一条路，以小丑的姿态出现在满清末年的封建社会的街头，准备接受任何的艰苦和笑骂，想凭他个人的悲剧性的反抗，替穷人争一口气，为下一代的孩子们争取教育的机会。从他含泪的笑眼里，我们看出了武训——劳动人民的孩子——对他同命运的无产阶级的一种真挚的，农民的无比的热爱。”（二六页）
    从这段话中，可以看到作者对于劳动和劳动人民，无产阶级和农民大众等等概念的理解，是抽象空洞，暧昧模糊的。这里所说的“世人”，如果不是指的地主豪绅官僚，而是指的人民大众，那又有什么教育意义呢？在重重压迫、掠夺和剥削之下的农民，辗转呻吟在死亡线上的农民，固然不应该流泪，而应愤怒，不应该悲伤，而应奋起，但又怎能叫他们都同武训这一丧尽了阶级意识，至死也不觉悟的奴才一样做苦工时唱歌，挨皮鞭时微笑，被夸奖时叩头谢恩，受宠若惊呢？
    这影片中固然描写了张举人及其狗腿赵熊、魏俊，地保高春山及其狗腿刘四等等的残暴不仁，阴险卑劣，但也很强调地描写了杨树坊、娄峻岭，郭芬等等的急公好义，开明清廉。这是对于统治阶级又是暴露又是歌颂，既写黑暗又写光明，作者企图暴露和歌颂并重，事实上却完全得到了歌颂的效果，“一半对一半”，原是不可能的事。
    这个影片有一个主题歌，它的歌词是：
    “一囊一钵，仆仆风尘。一砖一瓦，累积成金。街头卖艺，市上售歌。为牛为马，舍命舍身。世风何薄？大陆日沉。谁启我愚？谁济我贫？大哉武训，至勇至仁。行乞兴学，千古一人。”
    这个电影的主题思想是赞美武训的苦操奇行，颂扬他的事业和成功，这首主题歌正是极好的说明。我以为无条件地赞美武训的“艰苦作风”和“奋斗精神”，其实就是抽象的“人性论”的具体表现。
    电影中用不倒翁来象征武训的“坚强性格”，用幻游地狱来叙述武训“大彻大悟”的过程，借解放后冬学女教师的话来“批判”武训的方法和指出他的失败，不但是牵强的，而且还是有害的，因为这更模糊了群众的认识。
    有些人还往往以历史条件的限制来原谅武训，但事实却绝对不利于这种辩护。因为北征的太平军于一八五四年（咸丰四年）曾由李开芳率领攻入山东，这时武训已有十六岁，一八六五年（同治四年）赖文光所率领的捻军，也曾在山东大破清军，杀清帅僧格林沁，震动了满清的王朝，这时武训已有二十七岁，已是壮年。即使不提其他轰轰烈烈的，可歌可泣的，反对外国侵略者和国内反动封建统治的人民革命运动，仅仅这两次伟大的革命进军，照理说也应该使武训受到一些影响，使他有所觉悟，可是武训却完全没有一点类似觉悟的表现，毫无反抗统治阶级和解放自己的思想行动，反而日益走向投降的道路，这正是说明了十足的奴才本色和顺民性格。不错，在影片中曾经写了一个太平军战士周大，但这是一个被歪曲了的人物，并不能表现太平军战士的特色，作者拉他出场，也只是为了衬托武训的伟大，为了侮蔑中国农民革命。在电影小说中，有如下的一段描写，足资证明：
    “杀？……武训所听过的父老传说和故事中，从李闯王和他手下的农民逼得明末的崇祯皇帝上吊煤山，到八十年前一度占领过堂邑，寿张，阳谷等县城的山东贫民首领王伦，都是一败涂地，洪秀全五年前建都南京，忘记了穷人，听说这两年败的败，擒的擒，两湖和江西全入了曾国藩湘军手里，眼看大势已去……杀，又有什么用处？”
    我想这决不是当时一般农民，尤其是有觉悟的农民的思想情绪，而是十足的失败情绪和反对农民起义的奴才思想。作者也许想以武训的安分守己从反面来批判他的错误，可是事实上，这个作品的基本精神和性质，却不但根本抵消了这种暧昧无力的批判，而且反而更增加了主题思想的混乱性和消极性；看了周大下面回答武训的一段话，更可以明白了：
    “周大注视着武训，拍着武训的肩说：
    “好，武七！你来文的，我来武的。咱们一文一武，让那些狗官恶霸知道，咱们老百姓不是好欺负的！”（一三五、一三六页）
    借了周大的口，作者明明是肯定了，赞成了武训所走的道路，仿佛武训的道路和太平天国的道路是可以同时并行，互相调和，相得益彰似的。但实际上是不自觉地着重地宣扬了投降主义的胜利与成功，这当然不是忠实于历史的描写。
    这次《武训传》的公映和对于武训的歌颂，显然是采取了不正确的态度，违反了毛主席所指示的文艺方向。我想，既然称为新民主主义的文艺工作者，即不应失掉人民大众的立场，共产党员尤其应站稳党的立场。有人说《武训传》的思想虽不正确，在政治上讲虽则犯了严重的错误，但艺术性相当高，特别是演武训的赵丹先生演得很成功，可是这些人却就偏偏忘了艺术标准应该放在第二位，应该从属于政治标准，形式应该服从于内容，而且，内容愈反动，政治思想愈混乱或错误的作品，如果愈带艺术性，那也就能愈益毒害人民，就愈应排斥的这一极其明确的指示。我们应该反对歌颂任何敌人，歌颂任何丑恶的社会现象，应该反对以任何方式来表扬奴隶精神和磕头主义。我们的民族是伟大的民族，我们的人民是伟大的人民，奴隶精神和叩头主义决不是我们的传统，只知下跪叩头，屈膝投降的败类也决不是我们的祖先。如果不划清界限，爱憎分明，值得歌颂者才歌颂，应该暴露者坚决暴露，那就势必引起思想上的混乱，淆惑群众的视听，把他们引入歧途。我认为只有这样，才能逐渐提高理论水平和思想水平，才能坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，也才能更好地帮助文艺工作者获得正确的历史观点和阶级观点，劳动观点和人民观点，帮助他们正确地表现历史上的典型人物和典型事件，真正表现“我们中华民族的勤劳、勇敢，和智慧的崇高品质”。
    我深信这样的做是完全必要的，对大家是绝对有益的，因为这是一场严重的思想斗争。
