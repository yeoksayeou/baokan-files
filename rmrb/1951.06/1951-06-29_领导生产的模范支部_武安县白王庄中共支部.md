　　The Model Branch Leading Production
　　——The CCP Branch of Baiwangzhuang Village, Wu'an County

The CCP branch of Baiwangzhuang Village in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, has achieved great success in leading the masses in production. The Wu'an County Committee of the CCP commended the village branch as a "Model Branch" and called on all rural branches in the county to learn from the Baiwangzhuang branch.

Baiwangzhuang is a mountain village with thick stones and thin soil. The village has 329 households, with an average of just over one mu of land per person. In the past, the peasants' lives were very hard, and no fewer than 200 people were constantly fleeing famine and working as coolies. In recent years, under the leadership of the CCP branch and the People's Government, the peasants of the village have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "getting organized and developing production," and the face of this poor mountain village has changed. Now, all 329 households and more than 300 male laborers in the village have participated in mutual aid teams, led by Party members and cadres. These mutual aid teams have developed the village's agriculture and sideline production, thus greatly improving the lives of the people throughout the village. In recent years, the village has developed rapidly in terms of production: the number of draught animals has increased from 29 in 1945 to 113 now, and the number of sheep has increased from 400 to 2,600. In terms of cultivation, the village had already achieved two ploughings, five weedings, and 80 loads of manure per mu two years ago. Every household soaked and selected seeds, so that the yield of the land far exceeded that before the war. Before the war, the village could only harvest eight dou of grain per mu, but in recent years, it has been able to harvest an average of two shi, which is more than twice that before the war. In 1949, the village earned more than 80,000 jin of millet from sideline production, which not only made up for the shortage of agricultural income, but also bought 44 head of livestock. Last year, the village suffered a hailstorm, which reduced the harvest by an average of 30%, and every household was worried about the hardship of life. In the face of this difficulty, the village branch, on the one hand, tried to stabilize the morale of the masses, and on the other hand, helped the mutual aid teams to formulate a plan for surviving the famine through production, and organized more than 150 male laborers in the village to engage in sideline production, and 115 women to engage in textile work. In this way, from last winter to this spring, the village earned a total of 250,000 jin of coarse grains, which not only solved the living difficulties of each household, but also built more than 90 houses.

In order to develop production and reduce intermediate exploitation, the CCP branch of Baiwangzhuang also led the peasants to establish supply and marketing cooperatives. Now the cooperative has more than 900 members. The village's mutual aid teams lead the peasants in production, and the cooperative handles rural supply and marketing work according to the requirements of the members. Last year alone, the cooperative supplied members with living and production materials worth 46.9 million yuan at prices 15 to 25 percent lower than market prices, benefiting members by more than 8 million yuan. From last winter to this spring, the cooperative has also sold agricultural and sideline products worth more than 220 million yuan on behalf of its members.

This year, under the leadership of the village branch, Baiwangzhuang's production is even more planned. According to the plan, the village will strive to increase the yield of raw grain by 70 jin per mu this year (last year, the yield of grain per mu was 240 jin). In order to enhance the peasants' patriotic enthusiasm and political consciousness, and to ensure the completion of the production increase plan, each mutual aid team in the village has stipulated a system of collective study of current events every week.

The Baiwangzhuang branch has now become a banner for the rural branches in Wu'an County to lead production. After the Wu'an County Committee of the CCP called on all rural branches in the county to learn from the Baiwangzhuang branch, the CCP District Committee in the district where Baiwangzhuang is located also mobilized 17 village branches to visit Baiwangzhuang. According to the statistics of only four villages, such as Houqu and Miaoshang, after the visit, these four villages organized 23 mutual aid teams. Now a movement to learn from the Baiwangzhuang branch has been widely launched throughout Wu'an County.

### 领导生产的模范支部——武安县白王庄中共支部

　　领导生产的模范支部
    ——武安县白王庄中共支部
    河北省武安县白王庄中共支部，在领导群众生产上获得了很大成绩。中共武安县委表扬该村支部为“模范支部”，并号召全县农村支部向白王庄支部学习。
    白王庄是个石厚土薄的山庄，全村三百二十九户，每人平均只有一亩多地。过去农民生活很苦，常年在外逃荒做苦工的不下二百人。这几年该村农民在中共支部及人民政府领导下，贯彻了毛主席“组织起来、发展生产”的政策，这个贫困山庄的面貌就改观了。现在该村三百二十九户，三百余个男劳动力，在党员干部的带动下，已全部参加了互助组。这些互助组发展了该村的农业、副业生产，因而大大改善全村人民群众的生活。这几年，该村在生产方面发展很快：耕畜已由一九四五年的二十九头增加到现在的一百一十三头，羊由四百只增加到两千六百只。在耕作上，前年全村就已作到耕两遍、锄五遍、每亩上粪八十驮，家家户户浸种选种，使土地的产量远超过了战前。战前，该村每亩地只能收八斗粮食，这几年平均能收到两石，为战前两倍多。一九四九年，全村在副业生产上赚了八万多斤小米，除弥补了农业收入的不足外，还买了四十四头牲口。去年，该村受了雹灾，平均减了三成年景，家家发愁生活困难。在这个困难前面，该村支部一面设法稳定群众情绪，一面帮助各互助组制订了度荒生产计划，并且把全村一百五十多个男劳动力组织起来搞副业生产，一百一十五个妇女搞纺织。这样，从去冬到今春，全村共收入粗粮二十五万斤，除解决了各户的生活困难外，还盖了九十多间房子。
    为了发展生产，减除中间剥削，白王庄中共支部又领导农民建立了供销合作社。现在合作社已有九百多个社员。该村互助组领导农民生产，合作社就按照社员的要求办理农村供销工作。只去年一年，合作社就以低于市价百分之十五至二十五的价格，供给了社员价值四千六百九十余万元的生活资料及生产资料，使社员受益八百多万元。从去冬至今春，合作社又代社员推销了价值两亿二千多万元的农、副业产品。
    今年白王庄的生产在该村支部的领导下更加有计划了。根据计划，该村今年要争取每亩比去年增产原粮七十斤（去年每亩产粮二百四十斤）。为了提高农民的爱国热情和政治觉悟，保证完成增产计划，该村每个互助组都规定了每周集体学习时事的制度。
    白王庄支部，现已成为武安县农村支部领导生产的一面旗帜。中共武安县委号召全县农村支部向白王庄支部学习后，白王庄所在区的中共区委会，又发动了十七个村支部到白王庄去参观。仅据后渠、庙上等四个村的统计，参观后，这四个村就组织了二十三个互助组。现在武安全县已普遍展开向白王庄支部学习的运动。
