　　Must Win, Will Win!
　　Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea  Liao Chengzhi
　　It has been a year since the outbreak of the Korean People's Liberation War. In this year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side, giving heavy blows to the invading army headed by US imperialism and achieving a great victory. During its work in Korea, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea witnessed firsthand how the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers achieved this victory.

　　We saw the heroic, tenacious, simple, and hardworking Korean people's resolute resistance to the American aggressors; we saw the growth and strengthening of the Korean People's Army; we saw the great impact of the Korean land reform on the Korean people, and how the Korean people united around the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and the People's Army. We also saw how the Korean countryside relied on the old, weak, women, and children to complete the spring plowing, as well as the high patriotism and calm, courageous, selfless actions of the people in the rear. After contacting the heroic and tenacious Korean people, one cannot help but deeply feel that all of this is the glorious result of the Korean people's six years of hard struggle under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by General Kim Il-sung. Every member of the delegation felt unprecedented admiration and love for the fighting Korean people, and deeply felt that it was very glorious to fight side by side with such a hardworking, simple, and courageous people for their freedom and to shed blood on their land.

　　The delegation saw the serious destruction and cruel massacre inflicted on the Korean people by the brutal American aggressors, and deeply felt that our country's decision last October not to stand idly by while the United States invaded Korea was a completely correct and wise decision; otherwise, today, the area north of the Yalu River would very likely have become a ruin, just like northern Korea. The officers and soldiers of the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army deeply experienced this truth the moment they crossed the Yalu River. Therefore, they displayed a high degree of patriotism, overcame extraordinary difficulties, and, together with the Korean People's Army, inflicted serious blows on the fourteen-nation coalition army of the so-called "United Nations" supported by the United States, and shattered the US imperialism's wild attempt to occupy Korea and then invade China. The Chinese People's Volunteers are an army with a high degree of ideological awareness, excellent qualities, and fighting for justice. The officers and soldiers deeply understand that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is inseparable from protecting the homeland, and that the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea is a just war to defend peace and oppose aggression, representing the common aspirations of all the working people of China, the entire East, and even the world. Therefore, this war must be won, not defeated, and it will definitely be won, not defeated. Therefore, they are full of optimism. This is reflected in their firm belief that the war will inevitably be won, in their greatest courage to overcome any difficulties, and in their absolute ability to overcome these difficulties, and in the spirit of revolutionary heroism that permeates the entire army. This is an army composed of the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, this is an indestructible army with the great revolutionary tradition of the Chinese people.

　　The Korean People's Liberation War over the past year has proved that the strength of the world's peaceful and democratic camp exceeds that of the imperialist camp, that imperialism can be defeated, and that the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union can definitely guarantee the final victory. The Korean War since the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers has proved the greatness of the Chinese people's strength, proving that the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party can completely smash any imperialist aggressive schemes and completely defeat any imperialist adventurous offensives.

　　However, what the Chinese and Korean people are facing is the largest and last, and therefore the most frantic, American imperialism in the world. Therefore, the war will be long and arduous. But this enemy is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. His soldiers protest against the US imperialism's reactionary war of aggression with the mentality of not wanting to be cannon fodder. Therefore, military discipline is lax, morale is low, and the common phenomenon among soldiers is wanting to go home, war-weariness, and fear of death. Therefore, US imperialism can only maintain the morale of its invading army by consuming a large amount of steel. But with such a huge and continuous consumption of manpower and material resources, US imperialism cannot maintain it for a long time. Therefore, it is bound to fail.

　　Our people should fully recognize the inseparable relationship between the Korean People's Liberation War and the Chinese people's peace and happiness, and must therefore support the revolutionary war to resist US aggression and aid Korea with greater enthusiasm, so that the victory of the war will come sooner. And the fastest way to shorten the war is to make the determination and preparation for a long-term war. Only in this way can we not relax, not be impatient, and work more actively to win the victory of the war.

　　Our people throughout the country have responded to the call of the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea and launched a movement to donate planes and artillery to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Up to now, the people across the country have donated more than 1,000 planes. This is a concrete manifestation of the patriotism and internationalism of our people. With the strength of such a united and consolidated force of 475 million people to support the Korean War, the prospect of victory in the Korean War is even more certain. However, support is only just beginning. It has only taken the first step. This movement needs to be further expanded and deepened to ensure that the warriors on the Korean front can have not only sufficient but also abundant weapons and material conditions. Our people must recognize that every step taken in the war being waged south of the Yalu River today is closely related to our country's future destiny. This war must be won, and it will be won, but it must be accompanied by our constant and unremitting efforts to promote its complete realization. Let us fight with greater efforts for the happiness of the motherland, the Korean people, and the peace-loving people of the world!

　　必须胜利，必能胜利！
    中国人民赴朝慰问团团长  廖承志
    朝鲜人民解放战争爆发以来已一周年。在这一年当中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，给美帝国主义为首的侵略军以沉重的打击，取得了伟大的胜利。中国人民赴朝慰问团在朝鲜工作的期间，亲眼看到了朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军是怎样取得这一胜利的。
    我们看到了英勇顽强，朴素勤劳的朝鲜人民对美国侵略者的坚决抵抗；看到了朝鲜人民军的成长壮大；看到了朝鲜土地改革所给予朝鲜人民的巨大影响，以及朝鲜人民怎样团结在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、人民军的周围。我们也看到了朝鲜农村中怎样依靠老弱妇孺完成了春耕，以及后方人民的高度爱国心和沉着勇敢的忘我行动。在接触到英勇顽强的朝鲜人民之后，不能不深深感觉到这一切正是朝鲜人民在以金日成将军为首的朝鲜劳动党领导下，六年来艰苦奋斗的光荣成果。每一个慰问团团员对战斗的朝鲜人民感到从所未有的钦佩和敬爱，并且深深感觉到为这样一个勤劳、朴素、勇敢的人民，为了他们的自由和他们并肩作战，在他们的土地上流血，乃是非常光荣的。
    慰问团在朝鲜看到了残暴的美国侵略者所加予朝鲜人民的严重破坏与惨酷屠杀，深深感觉去年十月我国对美国侵略朝鲜不能置之不理，乃是完全正确的英明决断；否则今天鸭绿江以北，也就完全可能变成和朝鲜北部一样，成为一片废墟了。中国人民志愿军全军将士在跨过鸭绿江的第一步，就深深体验到这真理，因而发挥了高度的爱国心，克服异常的困难，和朝鲜人民军一起给予了美国扶持下的所谓“联合国”的十四国联军以严重的打击，粉碎了美帝国主义占领朝鲜进而侵略中国的狂妄阴谋。中国人民志愿军是一支具有高度思想性的，具有优秀品质的，为正义而战的军队，指战员们都深刻了解抗美援朝与保家卫国是不可分的，而抗美援朝的战争是保卫和平反对侵略的正义战争，代表着全中国全东方乃至全世界劳动人民的共同愿望，因此这战争必须打胜，不能打败，而且也一定能打胜，不会打败，因此他们充满着乐观情绪。这表现在他们坚信战争必然胜利，表现在他们有最大勇气克服任何困难，并且绝对能克服这些困难和表现在弥漫全军的革命英雄主义的气概上面。这是一支在中国共产党领导之下的伟大中国人民所组成的军队，因此，这是一支有伟大的中国人民革命传统的无坚不摧的军队。
    一年来的朝鲜人民解放战争，证明了世界和平民主阵营的力量超过了帝国主义阵营，证明了帝国主义是可以打败的，而以苏联为首的和平民主阵营必可以保证得到最后胜利。中国人民志愿军参战以来的朝鲜战争，证明了中国人民力量的伟大，证明了在毛主席和中国共产党领导下的中国人民，完全可以粉碎任何帝国主义的侵略阴谋，完全可以打败任何帝国主义的冒险进攻。
    然而，中、朝人民所面对着的是世界上最大也是最后、因而也是最疯狂的美国帝国主义。因此，战争就会是长期的，艰苦的。但是这个敌人是外强中干的，他的士兵以不愿当炮灰的心情抗议美帝国主义的反动的侵略战争，因此军纪松弛，士无斗志，士兵中普遍的现象是想回家，厌战，怕死，因而美帝国主义只能以大量消耗钢铁来维系他的侵略军队的士气。但这样人力物力如此庞大的继续不断的消耗，美帝国主义是无法长期维持下去的，因此他是必然要失败的。
    我国人民应该充分认识朝鲜人民解放战争与我国人民的和平幸福的密切不可分的关系，从而必须以更大的热情来全力支援抗美援朝的革命战争，使战争的胜利更早到来。而缩短战争的最快道路，就是作长期作战的决心和准备。只有这样，我们才能够不松懈、不急躁，更积极地为取得战争的胜利而努力。
    我国人民在全国各地响应抗美援朝总会的号召，发起了捐献飞机大炮给中国人民志愿军的运动，到现在为止，全国各地人民捐献的飞机已达一千多架。这是我国人民的爱国主义与国际主义精神的具体表现。以这样团结巩固的四亿七千五百万人民的力量来支援朝鲜战争，朝鲜战争的胜利前途就更确定无疑了。但是，支援才在开始。它只走了第一步。这个运动还有待于继续扩大和深入，才能确保朝鲜前线的勇士们能拥有不但足够而且丰裕的武器和物质条件。我国人民必须认识，今天在鸭绿江以南所进行的战争的每一步，都是与我国的今后命运息息相关着的。这战争必须胜利，必能胜利，但必须加上我们时刻不懈的努力，才能促成它的完完全全的实现。让我们以更大的努力，为祖国、为朝鲜人民、为全世界爱好和平的人民的幸福而斗争吧！
