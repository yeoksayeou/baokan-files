    Beijing Second District Cleaning Team
    180 People United to Improve Productivity and Donate Weapons
    Editor:
    We, the entire 180 workers of the Beijing Second District Cleaning Team, have united as one to respond to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea by increasing production and donating airplanes and cannons.
    On the evening of June 5th, the administration and the trade union jointly convened a general meeting of all workers. At the meeting, comrades displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and everyone put their minds together to think of ways to increase production and donate weapons. Old worker Chen Jinshou said, "We love our motherland, and we are willing and able. We can dig river mud after we finish our work and donate the wages we earn to the volunteer army to buy more weapons." Everyone agreed with his opinion. Team leader Zhang Fengyi said, "Although we sweat a little digging river mud, it is much easier than the volunteer soldiers. The volunteer soldiers are fighting for us, and we must support them." Some comrades said, "Digging river mud not only increases income and donates airplanes and cannons, but also makes our capital Beijing even more beautiful. We are building the motherland in the rear, and the volunteer army is fighting the enemy on the front lines. The entire Chinese people are of one heart, and we will surely defeat the American devils." Finally, everyone decided that every Friday, all 180 members of the team would dig river mud after finishing their work. In this way, we can earn at least 1.8 million yuan per week.
    A few days ago, we also selected ten people to specialize in digging river mud, and their work is done by everyone else; in this way, we can increase our income by 3 million yuan per month to donate. When the ten of them set off, all the comrades saw them off at the entrance of the alley. They said to everyone with great joy: "We know that the work we are going to do is glorious. We must strive to dig more soil so that we can donate more weapons."
    The work efficiency of the comrades at home has also been greatly improved. In the past, we swept the streets and dumped the soil, and each person had to work ten hours a day; now, it only takes about five hours a day to complete the task. We stipulate that we read the newspaper for two hours a day, study culture for two hours, and go to the park collectively every Wednesday.
    The improvement of everyone's political consciousness and work efficiency is the result of the anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic education. After signing the patriotic pact, we became more united and no longer bought things to eat casually while working. Most importantly, we studied ways to improve our work. In the past, we got up enthusiastically early in the morning to dump the soil, but the citizens were still sleeping, and there was no dirty soil to dump, and everyone wasted their time in vain; now we have studied and figured out that we should first go to the government offices and schools to dump the soil, and then dump the soil for the citizens; as a result, doing the same work only takes half the time.
    We are not satisfied with our current achievements, and we must learn from the cleaning teams in other districts, and we also hope that they will introduce their methods of increasing production and donating to us.

### 北京市第二区清洁队  一百八十人结成一条心提高生产效率捐献武器

    北京市第二区清洁队
    一百八十人结成一条心提高生产效率捐献武器编辑同志：
    我们北京市第二区清洁队全体工人一百八十个人结成了一条心，响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，增加生产捐献飞机大炮。
    六月五日晚上，行政和工会联合召开全体工人大会。在会上，同志们发扬了高度的爱国热情，大家开动脑筋来想增加生产捐献武器的办法。老工人陈金寿说：“我们爱祖国，有心有力。我们可以在做完工作后去挖河泥，把所得的工资，捐献给志愿军买更多的武器。”大家都赞成他的意见。队长张凤仪说：“我们挖河泥虽然流些汗，但比起志愿军战士们可轻松得多了。志愿军战士们为了我们打仗，我们一定要支援他们。”有的同志说：“挖河泥不但可以增加收入、捐献飞机大炮，并且还能把我们的首都北京建设得更美。我们在后方建设祖国，志愿军在前方打击敌人，全中国人民一条心，一定能打败美国鬼子。”最后，大家决定：每星期五，全队一百八十人在做完工作后去挖河泥。这样，我们每星期就至少可以收入一百八十万元。
    前几天，我们又抽出十个人专门去做挖河工作，他们的工作由大家代做；这样，我们每个月就又可以增加三百万元的收入来捐献。他们十个人出发时，全体同志送他们出胡同口，他们兴高采烈地向大家说：“我们知道：我们要去做的工作是光荣的。我们一定争取多挖几方土，使我们能捐献更多的武器。”
    在家里的同志工作效率也大大提高了。过去我们扫街、倒土，每人每天要工作十小时；现在每天只要五小时左右就可以完成任务。我们规定每天读报两小时，学文化两小时，每星期三还集体去游一次公园。
    我们大家政治觉悟的提高和工作效率的提高，都是受了抗美援朝爱国主义教育的结果。在订立爱国公约后，我们就更团结了，工作时也不再随便买东西吃了。最重要的是，我们研究了改进工作的方法。过去我们大清早就热情地起来倒土，但是市民们还都在睡觉，没有脏土可倒，大家白白浪费了时间；现在我们研究出先到机关学校去倒土，完了再为市民倒土；结果，做一样的工作，只要一半时间就够了。
    我们还不满足于我们现在的成绩，我们还要向其他各区清洁队学习，同时希望他们把增产捐献的办法也介绍给我们。
