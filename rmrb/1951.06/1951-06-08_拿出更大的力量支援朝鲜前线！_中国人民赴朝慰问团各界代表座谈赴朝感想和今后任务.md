To Bring Greater Strength to Support the Korean Front!
    —Representatives from All Sectors of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea Discuss Impressions and Future Tasks

Representatives from the worker, farmer, youth, women, ethnic minority, literary, education, and science/medical sectors of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea recently held separate symposiums. The representatives spoke freely about their impressions of the visit to Korea and put forward their future tasks in deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and vigorously supporting the Korean front.
        Worker Representatives' Symposium

    The worker representatives' symposium was conducted under the chairmanship of Zhao Guoyou, a nationally renowned model worker. The representatives unanimously pointed out: In Korea, they saw the factories and mines that the Korean working class had diligently built in the five years after liberation, many of which had been turned to ashes by the destruction and devastation of the American invading army. The representatives also saw the Korean worker brothers' high patriotic enthusiasm and staunch fighting will. They persisted in production under the barbaric bombing of enemy aircraft, powerfully supporting the front's operations. The representatives saw the heroic, resourceful, hardworking, and strong Chinese People's Volunteers and the volunteer Chinese railway workers and truck drivers. They had said to the representatives: In order for worker comrades in the motherland to produce with peace of mind, we are determined to defend the motherland's safety and completely and cleanly eliminate the American invading army in Korea. They said: We have ways to fight the war! Economic construction depends on you! The representatives at the meeting put forward their future tasks one after another: calling on worker brothers across the country to learn from the spirit of the volunteer soldiers and Korean worker brothers in overcoming difficulties and exerting their wisdom in production, to further carry out patriotic production competitions, and strive to improve the quantity and quality of production, to ensure that whatever the front needs is supplied; in terms of manpower, calling on more truck drivers, railway workers, and medical workers to go to the front to serve the soldiers more enthusiastically; in terms of materials, calling on workers across the country to vigorously launch a campaign to increase production and donate to support the front; for the families of workers who support the front or join the army, every factory and enterprise must always care for them and provide proper care.
            Farmer Representatives' Symposium

    The farmer representatives saw the situation of the enemy's brutal destruction of the Korean countryside. Many villages were completely bombed and burned down by enemy aircraft. The loss of livestock, the most important draft animals, reached about 60 to 80 percent. However, the Korean farmers were full of confidence in victory, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and completed this year's spring plowing ahead of schedule. The representatives also saw the Resist America, Aid Korea civilian labor team organized by farmers in Northeast China. At the welcoming rally, the civilian labor representatives made a guarantee to the delegation: they are determined not to return to the motherland until the American invading army on the Korean battlefield is completely eliminated. The farmer representatives unanimously proposed to widely publicize the atrocities of the U.S. and Rhee bandits they witnessed in Korea to farmers across the country, so that farmers can recognize the brutal face of American imperialism. The farmer representatives unanimously believed that: In order to protect their good lives, farmers across the country should establish patriotic pledges, carry out patriotic production movements, ensure that the front-line troops have enough to eat and wear, and actively participate in the production increase movement to donate airplanes, tanks, artillery, cars, and carts. The farmer representatives also called on young farmers to join the Volunteer Army and civilian labor teams and do a good job of providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, with villages as units.
            Youth and Women Representatives' Symposium

    The youth representatives unanimously called on young people at the symposium to work hard at their posts, while stepping up their studies, exercising, and preparing to go wherever the motherland needs them most. The youth representatives also called on young people to learn from the Korean youth's method of donating funds for airplanes, tanks, artillery, and other weapons through voluntary labor to support the front. The representatives said: Young people should become the most active propagandists in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, so that this movement truly becomes "a household name."

    The women representatives' symposium was conducted enthusiastically for two days. They proposed that women in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement should establish specific and practical patriotic pledges and inspect their implementation; launch donation campaigns; provide preferential treatment to military families; take care of and resettle disabled veterans; and write letters of comfort and make comfort bags for the volunteer soldiers.
            Ethnic Minority Representatives' Symposium

    The ethnic minority representatives' symposium was chaired by representative Bao Yan (Mongolian). Twelve representatives from Mongolian, Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, Tu, and Korean ethnicities attended.

    Inner Mongolia representative Gerletu (Mongolian) said that the serious destruction of the Korean people by American imperialism reminded him of the painful life of the people of Inner Mongolia under the rule of Japanese imperialism, feudal warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. He pointed out: We must mobilize the strength of all ethnic groups in the motherland to support Korea, achieve the final victory in the war to resist America, and defend the happiness and freedom of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Qinghai representative Xi Yuanshou (Tu ethnicity) believes that the national people sending delegations abroad to offer their condolences this time proves the unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups in our country. He said: He will tell all the ethnic groups in the entire Northwest and Qinghai about what he saw and heard in Korea, so that everyone will be mobilized to vigorously support Korea. Xinjiang representative Zakelov (Uyghur) specifically proposed at the meeting a preliminary plan for deeply developing the Resist America, Aid Korea movement after returning to Xinjiang: (1) Use the languages, scripts, and forms of all ethnic groups to widely publicize the experiences and gains of the visit to Korea through various propaganda weapons. (2) Mobilize people from all ethnic groups and sectors to universally establish patriotic pledges and strengthen national defense forces. In addition, a donation campaign of one yuan per person (Xinjiang currency, one yuan is equivalent to 450 yuan in Renminbi) will be launched. In his speech, Bao Yan proposed to deeply develop the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Inner Mongolia. He said: We must strengthen ethnic unity through patriotic education; donate leather, cattle, sheep, and medicines; do a good job of providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers; raise vigilance, prevent spies and secret agents, and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries.
            Literary Representatives' Symposium

    The literary representatives' symposium was personally chaired by Delegation Leader Liao Chengzhi and Deputy Leader Tian Han. The representatives believed that the literary work of this delegation was successful. The plays, folk arts, music, and acrobatics performed by the delegation's cultural troupe were diverse in form, concise and pithy, and some comrades were able to create works on the spot, and were therefore warmly welcomed by the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and the Korean people. When the representatives spoke of the literary workers of the Volunteer Army and the literary workers of the Korean people, they expressed their admiration for their heroic and arduous working spirit. The literary workers of the Chinese People's Volunteers not only created many combative works in fortifications, positions, and on marches, and came up with various methods to perform for the soldiers to encourage their morale, but also directly participated in combat support work; the patriotism and internationalism reflected in the literary works of the Korean people also need to be strengthened in our works. The representatives then discussed the future tasks of the literary and art circles. Everyone believed that the most important task is to reflect and inspire the great struggle of the Chinese and Korean people to resist America through various literary and artistic works. The representatives unanimously agreed to recommend that the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles systematically organize literary and art workers to go to Korea, transport more cultural food (such as movies, comic strips, allegro, etc.) and musical instruments (such as accordions, harmonicas, etc.) to Korea, and at the same time, strengthen the relationship with the literary workers of the Volunteer Army and the literary workers of Korea, exchange works and materials, and learn from each other. In his final speech, Delegation Leader Liao Chengzhi pointed out that literary and art workers should truthfully experience and reflect the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people with a correct attitude, and should more powerfully express the heroic and tenacious spirit of the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and the great strength to overcome all difficulties.
            Education Representatives' Symposium

    In the symposium, the education representatives unanimously felt that this visit to Korea was a great harvest, the most important of which was a great improvement in their ideological awareness. They saw the American invaders' planned destruction of Korean historical relics and educational facilities, and realized that unless the American invasion conspiracy is crushed one day, there will be no opportunity to engage in cultural and scientific research and construction with peace of mind. They all expressed their determination to be propagandists and organizers of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and at the same time, to review and improve the education content and teaching methods that had been divorced from reality in the past. They suggested that education workers across the country should immediately invest in the three major movements of signing patriotic pledges, donating materials, and providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers; at the same time, fully launch patriotic education with Resist America, Aid Korea as the content this summer, so that the entire education cause will have richer content and vigorous vitality.
            Science and Medical Representatives' Symposium

    At the symposium, science and medical representatives unanimously praised the spirit of the Korean scientific workers combining technology and politics to a high degree and the spirit of not forgetting to study in the situation of war. The representatives believed that the current tasks of scientific and medical workers are: to formulate patriotic pledges and ensure their implementation; to closely combine their work with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, such as doctors should study battlefield diseases and soldier nutrition issues; and to be propagandists and mobilizers of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, so as to support the Korean front with greater strength.

    ——中国人民赴朝慰问团各界代表座谈赴朝感想和今后任务
    中国人民赴朝慰问团的工人、农民、青年、妇女、少数民族、文艺界、教育界、科学与医疗界代表，最近曾分别举行座谈会。代表们在会上畅谈赴朝慰问的感想，并提出了今后在深入抗美援朝运动、大力支援朝鲜前线工作中的任务。
        工人代表座谈
    工人代表座谈会在全国著名劳动模范赵国有主持下进行。代表们一致指出：他们在朝鲜看到朝鲜工人阶级在解放后五年间所辛勤建设起来的工厂、矿山，在美国侵略军的破坏摧残下，许多已变成了灰烬。代表们也看到朝鲜工人弟兄高度的爱国热情和坚强的斗争意志。他们在敌机野蛮的轰炸下坚持生产，有力地支持了前线的作战。代表们在前线看到了英勇、机智、勤劳、刚强的中国人民志愿军和志愿援朝的中国铁路工人，汽车司机弟兄。他们曾对代表们说：为了祖国工人同志能安心生产，我们坚决保卫祖国安全，彻底干净消灭在朝鲜的美国侵略军。他们说：打仗我们有办法！经济建设看你们！代表们在会上纷纷提出今后的任务：号召全国工人弟兄在生产上，要学习志愿军战士们和朝鲜工人兄弟克服困难和发挥智慧的精神，进一步开展爱国主义生产竞赛，努力提高生产数量和质量，要做到前线需要什么，就供给什么；在人力上，号召更多的汽车司机、铁路工人、医务工作者，更踊跃地到前线去为战士们服务；在物力上，号召全国工人大力展开增产捐献运动，支援前线；对于支援前线或参军的工人家属，每一个工厂、企业要时刻予以关心，加以妥善的照顾。
            农民代表座谈
    农民代表们看到了朝鲜农村遭受敌人残酷破坏的状况。许多村庄整个被敌机炸毁了、烧光了。农村最重要的畜力耕牛的损失竟达百分之六十到百分之八十左右。但是，朝鲜农民却满怀胜利信心，克服种种困难，提前完成了今年的春耕，代表们在朝鲜也看到了我国东北农民组织的抗美援朝民工队。在慰问大会上，民工代表向慰问团提出保证：不把朝鲜战场上的美国侵略军彻底消灭，决心不回祖国。农民代表们一致提出要把在朝鲜所见所闻的美、李匪军暴行，向全国农民进行广泛的宣传，使农民们认识美帝国主义的残暴面目。农民代表们一致认为：为了保卫自己的好光景，全国农民应当订好爱国公约，搞好爱国主义生产运动，保证前线部队吃得饱、穿得暖，并积极参加捐献飞机、坦克、大炮、汽车和大车的增产运动。农民代表们还号召青年农民参加志愿军和民工队，以村为单位，做好优待烈属、军属的工作。
            青年、妇女代表座谈
    青年代表们在座谈会上一致号召青年们在自己的岗位上努力做好一切工作，同时加紧学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备到祖国最需要的地方去。青年代表们并号召青年们学习朝鲜青年用义务劳动的方式，集款捐献飞机、坦克、大炮等武器，支援前线。代表们说：青年们应该在抗美援朝运动中成为最积极的宣传者，使这个运动真正做到“家喻户晓”。

            少数民族代表座谈
    少数民族代表座谈会由包彦（蒙族）代表主持，到会者有蒙、维、回、哈萨克、土、朝鲜等族代表十二人。
    内蒙代表格尔勒图（蒙族）说，朝鲜人民所遭受到的美帝国主义的严重的破坏，使他想起过去内蒙人民在日本帝国主义、封建军阀以及国民党反动派统治下的痛苦生活。他指出：我们必须发动祖国各族人民的力量去支援朝鲜，取得抗美战争的最后胜利，保卫祖国各族人民的幸福与自由。青海代表席元寿（土族）认为，这次全国人民派遣代表团出国慰问，证明了我国各民族的空前团结。他说：他要把他在朝鲜的见闻，告诉全西北、全青海各族人民，使大家动员起来，大力支援朝鲜。新疆代表扎克洛夫（维吾尔族）在会上具体地提出他在返回新疆后深入开展抗美援朝运动的初步计划：（一）以各民族的语言、文字、形式，通过各种宣传武器，广泛地宣传赴朝慰问的经过和收获。（二）发动各族各界人民普遍订立爱国公约，加强国防力量。此外，并将发起一人一元（新疆币，一元合人民币四百五十元）捐献运动。包彦在发言中提出要深入开展内蒙抗美援朝运动，他说：要通过爱国主义教育加强民族团结；捐献皮革、牛羊和药品；做好对烈属、军属的优抚工作；提高警惕，防奸细防特务，坚决镇压反革命。
            文艺界代表座谈
    文艺界代表的座谈会在廖承志团长、田汉副团长的亲自主持下举行。代表们认为，这次慰问团的文艺工作是有成绩的。慰问团的文工团演出的戏剧、曲艺、音乐和杂技，形式多样，短小精悍，部分同志并能就地取材，因此，受到了中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎。代表们在谈到志愿军的文艺工作者和朝鲜人民的文艺工作者时，对于他们英勇、艰苦的工作精神，表示敬佩。人民志愿军的文艺工作者不仅在工事里、阵地上、行军途中创造了许多富有战斗性的作品，想出各种方法为战士们演出，鼓舞了战士们的斗志，并且直接参加战勤工作；朝鲜人民文艺作品中所表现的爱国主义和国际主义思想，也正是在我们的作品中需要加强的。代表们接着讨论了文艺界今后的任务，大家认为最重要的任务是要通过各种文艺作品来反映和鼓舞中朝人民伟大的抗美斗争。代表们一致同意建议全国文学艺术界联合会有计划地组织文艺工作者到朝鲜去，把更多的文化食粮（如电影、连环画、快板等）和乐器（如手风琴、口琴等）运到朝鲜去，同时，加强和志愿军文艺工作者及朝鲜文艺工作者的联系，交换作品和材料，互相学习。廖承志团长在最后发言中指出：文艺工作者应以正确的态度真实地体验并反映中、朝人民的英勇斗争，应当更有力地表现中朝人民战士的英勇顽强和战胜一切困难的伟大力量。
            教育界代表座谈
    教育界代表在座谈会中，一致感到这次去访问朝鲜有很大的收获，其中最重要的收获便是大大地提高了自己的思想觉悟。他们看到美国侵略者对朝鲜历史文物及教育设施的有计划的破坏，认识到美国的侵略阴谋一天不被粉碎，便不可能有安心从事文化科学研究建设的机会。他们都表示决心做一个抗美援朝运动的宣传者和组织者，同时要检讨和改进过去脱离实际的教育内容与教学方法。他们建议全国教育工作者应立即投入签订爱国公约、捐献物资和优待烈属、军属的三大运动中；同时在今夏全力展开以抗美援朝为内容的爱国主义教育，使整个教育事业有更丰富的内容和蓬勃的朝气。
            科学、医疗界代表座谈
    科学与医疗界代表在座谈会上，一致赞佩朝鲜科学工作者的技术与政治高度结合的精神以及在战争情况下不忘学习的精神。代表们认为，科学与医疗工作者当前的任务是：订立爱国公约并保证其实行；将自己的工作与抗美援朝运动密切地结合起来，例如医生应研究战地疾病及战士营养问题等；要做抗美援朝运动的宣传鼓动员，以更大的力量支援朝鲜前线。
