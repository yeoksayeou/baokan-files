Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

　　To the Editor:
    Regarding the letter from Comrade Xing Zhenhe, a reader from a factory in Zuoquan, published in the People's Daily Readers' Letters column on March 14, pointing out the delay in newspaper delivery time, this bureau has investigated and clarified the situation. The details are as follows:
    Newspapers for Zuoquan County are transported via the postal routes from Yangquan to Xiyang and from Xiyang to Zuoquan. In late February and early March of this year, during a change in postal routes, the Yangquan and Xiyang bureaus did not pay sufficient attention to the speed of postal transport and failed to dispatch all newspapers as soon as they arrived, resulting in abnormal phenomena such as reversed issue numbers for newspapers going to Zuoquan. This phenomenon was caused by our insufficient subjective efforts and lack of prior guidance to the transiting bureaus. Now, our bureau has dispatched a special person to investigate and correct past mistakes. Newspapers subscribed to by readers in Zuoquan will be delivered on time from now on.
                                          Shanxi Postal Administration

### 山西邮政管理局对送报延误时间的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　山西邮政管理局对送报延误时间的答复编辑同志：
    三月十四日人民日报读者来信栏刊载左权某厂读者邢振和同志来信，指出报纸送递延误时间一节，本局已查清。经过情形如下：
    左权县的报纸，系经阳泉至昔阳及昔阳至左权的邮路转运。本年二月下旬及三月上旬，改变邮路期间，阳泉及昔阳两局对于邮运速度重视不够，未能将所有报纸随到随发，以致去左权的报纸发生期数颠倒等不正常的现象。这种现象是由于我们主观努力不够，事前对于经转各局缺少指导而产生。现在我局已派专人调查并纠正过去的错误，左权各阅户所订阅之报纸，今后可以按时送到。
                                          山西邮政管理局
