　　US Expansion of Aggression Strains Resources
    Warmongers Exposed in Senate Quarrels
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch] The joint hearings of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees on the so-called MacArthur affair have increasingly revealed the U.S. imperialists' aggressive ambitions. At the same time, they have exposed the distress of those adventurers who vainly attempt to conquer the world as they find themselves struggling beyond their capabilities.
    From May 15 to May 31, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, Army Chief of Staff Collins, Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, and Chief of Naval Operations Sherman testified before the joint committee. They all defended Truman's policy of aggression in Korea and vigorously advocated preparations for expanding the war.
    Since MacArthur told the Senate that his actions in Korea were directly instructed by the White House, and that his plans to expand the war were also agreed to by the Pentagon, and Marshall subsequently confirmed this point, no witness at the joint hearings has "in principle" opposed MacArthur's line. All testimony has focused on assessing the consequences of expanding aggression and weighing the timing and conditions for launching it.
    Bradley admitted in his testimony that he, at least "in theory," favored "bombing Manchurian Chinese bases, attacking Chinese coastal cities, and blockading China." Collins, after discussing MacArthur's various proposals, confirmed that the main difference between the Chiefs of Staff and MacArthur was a "matter of timing." Vandenberg, when Republican Senator Hickenlooper pointed out that he had expressed similar views to MacArthur on military policy toward Korea, admitted that he had published an article in a magazine in March of this year publicly calling for expanding U.S. Air Force attacks on Chinese territory. Sherman even openly stated that he favored using force to impose an "effective commercial and naval blockade" on China.
    These top U.S. military decision-makers blatantly announced in their testimony that they wanted to seize our territory of Taiwan, regarding it as a necessary strategic base for the United States. Bradley shamelessly said: "We have always said that it [Taiwan] has sufficient strategic value to justify our occupying it with our own troops."
    These warmongers spoke wantonly about how to "destroy" humanity and create "ruins" during the testimony sessions. They openly declared that U.S. imperialism used the Air Force as a "big stick" (Vandenberg) to enslave the world, and advocated using the Navy to "show the strength of the anti-communist forces to the CCP and their Asian neighbors" (Sherman).
    However, it is precisely these American military "authorities" who helplessly revealed that behind the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism lies the real distress of being overstretched. Bradley admitted on the 15th that it would be "very difficult" for the United States to fight on both the Eastern and Western fronts simultaneously. At the hearing on the 21st, he further admitted that if MacArthur's plan were implemented, "we might find that the war has expanded to an extent that is beyond our ability to conduct smoothly."
    Collins said woefully that the problem was not whether to expand the war, but that the United States was "not ready."
    Vandenberg, who worships the omnipotence of the Air Force, admitted that the U.S. Air Force, on which he pinned his hopes, was merely "an Air Force without surplus strength," so much so that it was not capable of handling the military tasks of the Korean battlefield. He also expressed great concern that even this "big stick," the lifeline of U.S. imperialism, might prove to be just "a willow branch."
    What particularly worried these warmongers was that U.S. imperialism was sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire in Korea, threatening to bankrupt its global war of aggression plan. Bradley said sadly: "Of course, the longer the Korean problem drags on, the worse our preparations to deal with any aggression elsewhere [should read: U.S. preparations for aggression against other places] will be." None of these "military authorities" could answer how to solve this great problem of being overstretched.

### 美扩大侵略力不从心  战争贩子们在参院争吵中暴露

　　美扩大侵略力不从心
    战争贩子们在参院争吵中暴露
    【新华社一日讯】美国参议院外交和军事两委员会联席会议关于所谓麦克阿瑟事件的调查已愈来愈明显地暴露了美帝国主义的侵略野心，同时也透露了那些妄想征服全世界的冒险家正陷于力不从心的苦恼中。
    从五月十五日起到三十一日，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷，陆军参谋长柯林斯、空军参谋长范顿伯和海军作战部长薛尔曼先后在联席会议上作证，他们一致为杜鲁门的侵略朝鲜政策辩护，并竭力鼓吹准备扩大战争。
    自从麦克阿瑟向参议院说出他的侵朝行动是直接奉白宫指示、他的扩大战争计划也为五角大楼所同意，而马歇尔跟着又对这点加以证实以后，联席会议上的证人已无人再在“原则上”反对麦克阿瑟的路线，所有的作证都集中在对扩大侵略之后果的估计，以及对于发动的时机和条件的权衡上。
    布莱德雷在作证时承认：他至少“在理论上”是赞成“轰炸满洲中国基地、进攻中国沿海城市、封锁中国等办法”的。柯林斯在论述了麦克阿瑟的各点办法之后证实：参谋长们和麦克阿瑟间的主要分歧只是“时间问题”。范顿伯在共和党参议员希根鲁普指出他在对朝鲜的军事政策上曾有与麦克阿瑟相同的情形时承认：他在今年三月间曾在杂志上发表文章公开要求扩大美国空军侵袭中国国境的活动。薛尔曼更是公然表示他赞成以武力对中国实施“有效的商业与海军封锁”。
    这些美国军事最高决策者在作证时明目张胆地宣布要攫取我国领土台湾把它看作是美国必需的战略基地。布莱德雷无耻地说：“我们始终说，它（台湾）有足够的战略价值，足以作为我们以我们自己的军队占据它的理由。”
    这些战争贩子在作证会议上放肆地谈论着如何“毁灭”人类和制造“废墟”。他们公开宣告美帝国主义以空军作为它奴役世界的“大棒”（范顿伯），主张用海军“向中共和他们的亚洲邻邦一显反共部队的力量”（薛尔曼）。
    但是，也正是这些美国的军事“权威”人士，无可奈何地透露了美帝国主义这种狰狞面目背后的真实苦闷是力不从心。布莱德雷在十五日承认，美国若要在东西双方同时作战“将是非常吃力的事情”。在二十一日作证会上，他进一步承认，如果照麦克阿瑟的办法行动起来，“我们可能发现战争已扩大到不是我们的能力所能顺利进行的程度”。
    柯林斯苦恼地说，问题不在于要不要扩大战争，而是在于美国还“没有准备就绪”。
    崇拜空军万能的范顿伯承认，他所寄以厚望的美国空军不过是“一支没有多余力量的空军”，以至于不足以胜任朝鲜战场的军事任务。他还表示非常忧虑，甚至作为美帝国主义命根子的这根“大棒”可能也会证明只是“一根柳条”。
    特别使这些战争贩子感到焦心的是，美帝国主义在朝鲜的泥足正在越陷越深，有使它的全球侵略战争计划破产的危险。布莱德雷悲哀地说：“当然，朝鲜问题拖得越久，我们应付其他地方任何侵略的准备（应读作美国对其他地方的侵略准备）就越差。”这个力不从心的绝大难题究竟如何解决，所有这些“军事权威人士”都回答不出来。
