　　Huailai Taishizhuang Village Inspects the Implementation of the Patriotic Pact
    Strengthens Work on Preferential Treatment for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel
    In order to regularize the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, Taishizhuang Village in Huailai County, Chahar Province, promptly inspected the implementation of the Patriotic Pact and established a propaganda network in conjunction with practical work. Before May 1st, 95 percent of the villagers in Taishizhuang Village participated in signing the World Peace Pact and voting against the United States' arming of Japan. All the farmers, militiamen, and women in the village formulated patriotic pacts. After May 1st, the village held a village people's representative meeting to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the Patriotic Pact. They found that the two items, "Guarantee that 90 percent of the village's land will be planted with special crops such as peanuts and sunflowers" and "100 percent of the village's male and female labor force will learn seed soaking," were the worst implemented. Zhang Wenliang, the secretary of the CCP branch in the village, then proposed the slogan "Planting more special crops and learning seed soaking can increase the strength to Resist America, Aid Korea," calling on CCP members and Communist Youth League members to take the lead in completing the plan. The meeting also formulated a plan to continue in-depth patriotic education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea in May and June, and decided to conduct inspections once a week. In the first week of May, they promoted the planting of special crops and seed soaking and mixing. Some farmers were concerned that the prices of special crops would fall after the autumn harvest. Propagandist Gao Yun addressed their concerns by emphasizing that state-owned companies had signed pre-purchase contracts with the county and district governments, guaranteeing that farmers would not suffer losses after the autumn harvest, and promoted the great significance of planting special crops for consolidating national defense and developing economic strength. This greatly increased their patriotic enthusiasm, eliminated their concerns, and they actively rushed to plant peanuts, sunflowers, and tobacco. The village's work of plowing on behalf of others was not done well enough. Model worker Fan Deman among the propagandists, propagandist Gao Yun, and others mobilized the youth of the village to do a day's work for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel on "May Fourth" Youth Day. More than 100 young men and women from the village participated, and many adults also participated voluntarily. In one day, they prepared soil blocks for 76 mu of land, planted 12 mu of corn, delivered manure and soil for more than 1,015 loads, and built more than 600 new kang bricks and repaired three houses for 20 families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel in the village. Under the influence of their model actions, many farmers in the village who contracted to plow land for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel voluntarily revised their contracts, guaranteeing to cultivate the land as carefully as their own. Due to the promotion of the anti-American patriotic propaganda, the village's bumper harvest movement has greatly advanced. All the farmers in the village are actively soaking and mixing seeds, and rushing to plant special crops such as peanuts, sunflowers, and tobacco. All eleven mutual aid teams and many farmers in the village have also launched a heated challenge competition.
    The CCP branch in the village developed 19 propagandists during the popularization movement of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in April, and through the propaganda of increasing the planting of special crops, seed soaking, and drought resistance, the propaganda work was gradually regularized and the propaganda network was consolidated. After May 1st, the propagandists in the village adopted the method of "division of labor and responsibility," with two or three propagandists responsible for the propaganda and education work of one neighborhood (there are eight neighborhoods in the village), and the division of labor was carried out according to the special strengths of each propagandist. For example, propagandist Zhang Wenming can recite clapper talk, so he organized a clapper talk team. Communist Youth League member Fan Xuecheng is responsible for rooftop broadcasting, and he mobilized more than 30 young men and women and elementary school students to participate in the broadcasting work. Women's folk schools and farmer literacy classes also have dedicated personnel responsible for them. Such a detailed division of labor and specific leadership enable the farmers in the village to receive political education regularly. The CCP branch in the village also decided to hold a propaganda meeting once a week, ensuring that propagandists are sent to participate in the propagandist training station held by the district committee to cultivate propagandists.

　　怀来太师庄村检查爱国公约执行情况        
    加强优待烈属军属工作
    为了使抗美援朝运动经常化，察哈尔省怀来县太师庄村及时检查爱国公约的执行情况，并结合实际工作建立宣传网。太师庄村有百分之九十五的村民在“五一”以前，参加了拥护缔结世界和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本的投票。全村农民和民兵、妇女都分别订立了爱国公约。“五一”以后，该村召开了村人民代表会，对执行爱国公约的情形作了一次全面检查。他们发现“保证全村土地百分之九十种花生、葵花等特种作物”，“全村男女劳动力百分之百学会浸种”这两条做得最差。该村中共支部书记张文亮就提出“多种特种作物，学会浸种，就能增加抗美援朝力量”的口号，号召中共党员、青年团员带头完成计划。会上并制定了五、六两月继续深入抗美援朝爱国教育的计划，并确定每周检查一次。五月第一周，宣传种植特种作物和浸种、拌种。有部分农民存在着种特种作物怕秋后跌价的顾虑。宣传员高云就针对他们的思想情况，着重解释国营公司已和县、区政府签订预购合同，保证农民秋后不吃亏的办法，并宣传种特种作物对巩固国防和发展经济力量的重大意义，于是大大提高了他们的爱国热情，消除了顾虑，他们都积极地赶种花生、葵花和烟叶。该村的代耕工作还作得不够好，宣传员中的劳动模范范得满，宣传员高云等就发动全村青年在“五四”这一天给革命烈士和革命军人家属做一天活。全村一百多青年男女全部参加，许多壮年也自动参加，一天中就给该村二十户革命烈士和革命军人家属打了七十六亩地的土块，种了十二亩玉米，送粪、倒土达一千零十五驮，还打了六百多块新炕坯，修了三间房。在他们这种模范行动影响下，村里许多替革命烈士家属和革命军人家属包耕的农民都自动和革命烈士家属和革命军人家属重新修订包耕合同，保证和自己的地一样地精心耕作。由于抗美爱国宣传的推动，该村丰产运动已大大前进了一步。全村农民都积极浸种、拌种；并赶种花生、葵花、烟叶等特种作物。全村十一个互助组和许多农民之间，还展开了热烈的挑战竞赛。
    该村中共支部在四月份抗美援朝普及运动中发展了宣传员十九人；并经过增种特种作物、浸种和抗旱的宣传，使宣传工作逐渐经常化，并巩固了宣传网。“五一”后，该村宣传员采取“分工包干”的办法，两三个宣传员负责一个闾（该村共八个闾）的宣传教育工作，并按每个宣传员的特长进行分工。如宣传员张文明会说快板，就由他组织一个快板队。青年团员范学成负责屋顶广播，他又动员了青年男女、小学生三十多人参加了广播工作。妇女民校和农民识字班也都有专人负责。这样细密的分工和具体领导，使该村农民能经常受到政治教育。该村中共支部并确定每周开一次宣传会议，保证派宣传员参加区委举办的宣传员传授站学习，培养宣传员。
