Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: Educators from universities in Beijing have jointly written letters to educators from universities in the United States and Japan. The letters were signed by: Wu Yuzhang, President of Renmin University of China; Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University; Ye Qisun, Chairman of the University Affairs Committee of Tsinghua University; Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the University Affairs Committee of Peking University; Lin Liru, President of Normal University; Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University; Li Zong'en, President of Peking Union Medical College, and a total of 5,658 faculty and staff members from various universities.

The letter to educators at American universities stated: The US government is using the excuse that other countries are threatening US security to expand its military and prepare for war. They claim that all of this is for peace and self-defense. But it is not other countries, but precisely the US government, that is building many naval and air bases in the territory of other countries thousands of miles away. It is not other countries, but precisely the US government, that is destroying the peaceful cities and villages of another country with tens of thousands of tons of bombs and gasoline bombs. It is not other countries, but precisely the US government, that has openly organized an "international coalition" for the purpose of aggression and appointed its own generals as commanders during peacetime, which is unprecedented in history.

The letter pointed out that the US government's recent proposal of the "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" attempting to rearm Japan is a complete violation of international agreements. The Chinese people cannot but believe that this is a further aggression against China, and will expand into aggression against the whole of Asia. This will create a world-wide disaster. The letter stated that the liberated Chinese people will never allow such aggression and have the strength to repel it. The letter concluded by stating that educators from universities in Beijing are willing to unite with educators from American universities to fight together against the US government's actions that endanger the world and all of humanity!

The letter to educators at Japanese universities pointed out that the US government's proposed separate "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" proves that US imperialism's rearmament of Japan is for the benefit of the US ruling clique itself. If Japan is armed, it will become a tool for US imperialism to invade Asia, to be driven by US imperialism, and to be its cannon fodder, which will inevitably destroy the Japanese people first. The letter pointed out that the Japanese people have achieved great success in the struggle for freedom and defense of peace, and expressed the hope that this struggle will continue to expand and persevere to the end. The letter also expressed the Chinese people's deep sympathy for the Japanese people's liberation movement and the belief that the close cooperation and concerted action of the Chinese and Japanese people will surely shatter the conspiracy of US imperialism.

　　北京市各大学教育工作者
    致函美日两国大学教育工作者
    希望紧密携手粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋
    【新华社十一日讯】北京市各大学教育工作者联名写信给美国和日本大学的教育工作者。在信上签名的有：中国人民大学校长吴玉章、燕京大学校长陆志韦、清华大学校务委员会主任委员叶企荪、北京大学校务委员会主席汤用彤、师范大学校长林砺儒、辅仁大学校长陈垣、协和医学院院长李宗恩以及各校教职员工共计五千六百五十八人。
    在致美国大学教育工作者的信上说：美国政府借口别的国家在威胁美国的安全，进行扩军，进行备战。他们反说这一切都是为了和平，为了自卫。但是在几千英里外别国的领土上建筑许多海空军基地的，不是别国的而恰恰是美国的政府。用成万吨的炸弹和汽油弹毁灭另一个国家的和平城市和乡村的，也不是别国的而恰恰是美国的政府。在和平时期，史无前例地公开组织了以侵略为目的的“国际联军”，并任命了它自己的将领做统帅的，更不是别国的而恰恰是美国的政府。
    信中指出美国政府最近提出《对日和约草案》，企图重新武装日本，这是完全违反国际协定的。中国人民不能不认为这是要进一步侵略中国，并且将扩大为侵略全亚洲。这样就会造成世界性的灾难。信中表示，解放了的中国人民决不许可这样的侵略，而且有力量来击退它。该信最后说明北京市各大学教育工作者愿意和美国大学教育工作者团结一道，为了反对美国政府这个危害世界、危害全人类的行为而共同奋斗！
    在致日本大学教育工作者的信中指出：美国政府所拟的单独“对日和约草案”证明，美帝国主义的重新武装日本是为了美国统治集团本身的利益。日本如果被武装起来，就会变成美帝国主义侵略亚洲的工具，供美帝国主义驱使，当它的炮灰，结果必然首先毁灭日本人民。信中指出，日本人民在争取自由、保卫和平的斗争中，已经获得了很大的成就，希望这种斗争继续扩大，并且坚持到底。信中并表示中国人民深切地同情日本人民的解放运动，并且相信，中日两国人民的紧密携手，一致行动，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
