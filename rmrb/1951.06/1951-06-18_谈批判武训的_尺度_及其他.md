To the Editor:
    After reading Mr. Xiao Zuo's "The Movie *Wu Xun Zhuan* Still Has Certain Value," I believe his statement is incorrect.

    Mr. Xiao says: "Wu Xun was a common peasant. He had no opportunity to attend school, didn't recognize a single character of Confucius, let alone Marxism-Leninism." At the same time, he "was also a fellow townsman of Confucius and particularly conservative," therefore, he should not be required to "start a revolution like Hong Xiuquan," as long as he can be "stronger than Zeng Guofan." This is "not a question of 'lowering the scale'."

    First of all, Wu Xun was, in fact, not a common peasant. He mainly made a living by begging, lending money at interest, and collecting rent throughout his life. Initially, he was a professional vagrant, and later became a usurer and landlord. Secondly, I have seen all the articles criticizing Wu Xun, and none of them have ever demanded that Wu Xun understand "Marxism-Leninism." Therefore, Mr. Xiao can only be considered to have shot an arrow without a target. Furthermore, there are progressive people who are "fellow townsmen of Confucius," and there are also "conservative" people who are not "fellow townsmen of Confucius." Whether or not one is a "fellow townsman" cannot be taken as a reason for being "particularly conservative."

    Now let's talk about the issue of lowering the scale.

    The movie *Wu Xun Zhuan* portrays Wu Xun as a "heroic figure" to be "eulogized." It depicts Wu Xun as "serving the people wholeheartedly," "willing to be the ox of the proletariat and the masses," saying that he possesses "the will of a labor hero," is a "vanguard of the peasant class," a "banner of the cultural emancipation of the working people," and "typically embodies the noble qualities of diligence, courage, and wisdom of our Chinese nation." So, in Mr. Xiao's mind, revolutionaries who "serve the people wholeheartedly," "labor heroes," "vanguards of the class," "banners" of the "working people," and "typical" representatives of the "Chinese nation" can only be required to be "stronger than Zeng Guofan." And this is "not a question of 'lowering the scale'." We should be thankful that our revolutionaries, vanguards, heroes, and those who serve as banners and typical representatives, have not used Mr. Xiao's "scale" to demand of themselves. The vast majority of Chinese people have also not used Mr. Xiao's "scale" to demand our revolutionaries, vanguards, heroes, and those who serve as banners and typical representatives. Only in this way could the Chinese people be guaranteed today's great victory.

    Mr. Xiao uses "acupuncture," "penicillin," and "high-speed cutting" as examples to compare with Wu Xun, which is somewhat inappropriate. Wu Xun's "promoting education" is neither "acupuncture" nor "penicillin," but rather "witch doctors treating diseases, dancing the *San Shan Dao* dance." On the other hand, it is also not some "high-speed cutting," but rather "one punch for two cents, one kick for three cents."

    Mr. Xiao says: "The vast countryside has already implemented land reform, and the peasants have already been emancipated economically and politically; factories and enterprises have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and the workers have stood up. ..." "Given this, the 'Wu Xun spirit' cannot have the slightest influence in the Mao Zedong era." This statement does not conform to objective reality. The appearance of the movie *Wu Xun Zhuan* is one proof, and the widespread praise for *Wu Xun Zhuan* is the second proof. Mr. Xiao's defense of *Wu Xun Zhuan* and its eulogizers is the third proof.

    Because our People's Republic has been established for less than two years, and the people have only recently gained the opportunity to "educate themselves and transform themselves democratically on a national scale and across the entire population." On the other hand, the people have been influenced by internal and external reactionaries for a long time, "this influence is still very great and will exist for a long time, and cannot be eliminated quickly." Furthermore, on the Wu Xun issue, our progressive educators and artists once again put a revolutionary coat on him (Wu Xun), using various forms (movies, illustrated biographies, chapter novels, comic strips, papers) to "eulogize." Therefore, believing that promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" "cannot have the slightest influence" among the people, resting on one's laurels and going to sleep, abandoning the serious ideological struggle on the "Wu Xun issue," and abandoning the continued exposure of erroneous ideas, is harmful to the people.

    Affirmatively speaking: the movie *Wu Xun Zhuan* has no value whatsoever, because it mistakenly eulogizes people and events that should not be eulogized, and slanders the peasant revolutionary struggle, and slanders Chinese history. We must resolutely and persistently expose this error, until this kind of erroneous understanding is completely eradicated from the minds of every Chinese person (including Mr. Xiao and myself).

### 谈批判武训的“尺度”及其他

专栏：读者来信

　  谈批判武训的“尺度”及其他编辑同志：
    读了萧奏先生“电影《武训传》还是有一定的价值”以后，我认为他的说法是错误的。
    萧先生说：“武训是一介劳动农民，他没有机会上学，连孔夫子的字一个也认不得，更不要说马列主义了。”同时他“又是孔夫子的老乡，又特别保守”，因此也就不应该要求他“像洪秀全那样闹革命”，只要他能“比曾国藩要强些”就行了。“这也不是什么‘降低尺度’的问题”。
    首先，武训事实上就不是什么劳动农民。他一生中主要是靠讨饭放债、收租过活的，起先是一个职业的游民，后来成了高利贷者和地主。其次，我看到所有批判武训的文章，都没有要求过武训懂得“马克思列宁主义”，因此，萧先生只能算是放了一支无的之矢。再其次，“孔夫子的老乡”也有进步的，非“孔夫子的老乡”也有“保守”的，“老乡”不“老乡”，不能当作“特别保守”的原因。
    现在来谈一谈降不降低尺度的问题。
    电影《武训传》是将武训作为一个“英雄人物”来“歌颂”的。它将武训描写成“全身心为人民服务”，“甘心做无产阶级和人民大众的牛”，说他具有“劳动英雄的意志”，是“农民阶级的先觉者”，是“劳动人民文化翻身的一面旗帜”，“典型地表现了我们中华民族的勤劳、勇敢、智慧的崇高品质”。原来在萧先生的心目中，“全身心为人民服务”的革命者，“劳动英雄”，“阶级的先觉者”，“劳动人民”的“旗帜”，和“中华民族”的“典型”，都只能要求是“比曾国藩”“强些”。并且这还“不是什么‘降低尺度’的问题”。我们应该庆幸，我们的革命者，先觉者，英雄，和作为旗帜和典型的人物，都没有用萧先生这种“尺度”来要求自己。绝大多数的中国人，也没有用萧先生这种“尺度”来要求我们的革命者，先觉者，英雄，和作为旗帜和典型的人物。这样才保证了中国人民有今天这样伟大的胜利。
    萧先生举出“针灸法”、“盘尼西林”和“高速度切削法”为例子来比喻武训，这是有些不伦不类的。武训的“兴学”既非“针灸法”，又非“盘尼西林”，而是“巫神治病，跳三山刀”。另外一方面也不是什么“高速度切削法”，而是“打一拳两个钱，踢一脚三个钱”。
    萧先生说：“广大的农村已经实行了土地改革，农民已经从经济上和政治上翻了身；工厂企业已经从帝国主义和官僚资本主义的枷锁中解放出来，工人已经站起来了。……”“既然这样，那‘武训精神’在毛泽东时代就不可能发生丝毫影响。”这种讲法是不符合客观实际的。电影《武训传》的出现是证明之一，对《武训传》的纷纷歌颂又是证明之二，萧先生对于武训传及其歌颂者的辩护是证明之三。
    由于我们的人民共和国成立才不到两年，人民获得“在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己”的机会还不久。在另外一方面，人民过去长期受着内外反动派的影响，“这个影响现在还是很大的，并且将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭。”再加上在武训这个问题上，我们进步的教育家与文艺家又曾经替他（武训）穿上了革命的外衣，用各种的形式（电影、画传、章回小说，连环图画、论文）来进行“歌颂”。因此，认为宣传“武训精神”在人民中“不可能发生丝毫影响”，垫高枕头来睡觉，放弃对“武训问题”上的严肃的思想斗争，放弃继续揭发错误的思想，对人民是有害的。
    肯定的说：电影《武训传》是没有丝毫价值的，因为它错误地歌颂了不应该歌颂的人和事，并且污蔑了农民革命斗争，污蔑了中国历史。我们必须坚决地、再接再厉地揭发这种错误，一直到把这一类的错误认识从每一个中国人（包括萧先生也包括我自己）的脑子里彻底肃清为止。
