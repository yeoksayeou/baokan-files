　　The Heroic Image of the People's Liberation Army Should Be Correctly Shaped!
    ——A Review of the Film "Company Commander Guan"
    Feng Zheng
    We love the people's film art, especially the film art that reflects and eulogizes the excellent essence and great revolutionary heroism of our People's Liberation Army. This is understandable, because it is with this People's Army, led by the Chinese Communist Party, educated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and grown up in battle, that we have created the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and our glorious New China. And the film workers have diligently shaped the heroic image of the People's Army, vividly bringing the life and history of this army, which serves the people wholeheartedly, onto the screen. Undoubtedly, this is a great encouragement to the victorious Chinese people, especially the people's soldiers.

    The new film "Company Commander Guan" by Shanghai Wenhua Film Company is a film that intends to depict the excellent qualities and great deeds of the People's Liberation Army. It attempts to express the essence of our army, "coming from the people, for the people, and serving the people," through the combat hero Company Commander Guan and the "Model Company" he leads; through Company Commander Guan, who was born as a emancipated farmer, and through the themes of our army loving children and fighting bravely, to shape a typical image of the revolutionary hero who is willing to sacrifice everything for the greatest interests of the people. The film also contains descriptions of our army's pleasant cultural and recreational life, cultural learning, mutual love and care between comrades, and criticism and self-criticism regarding the democratic life of the troops... These are of course fresh to people who are not very familiar with the internal life of our army. The author of the film "Company Commander Guan" has good subjective intentions and their efforts to produce this film are commendable. However, because this film seriously distorts and misunderstands the excellent essence and heroic image of our People's Liberation Army in many places, and the troops, characters and life portrayed in the film are extremely inconsistent with our battle-hardened Chinese People's Liberation Army, it not only fails to achieve the effects expected by the subjective intentions, but on the contrary, will spread some bad influences among the people about our heroic People's Liberation Army. Therefore, it should be given a stern criticism.

    How does the film "Company Commander Guan" distort the essence of the People's Liberation Army and the image of revolutionary heroes?

    First of all, it does not adequately express the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the People's Liberation Army, and even distorts and obliterates the leading role of the Party in our army. Everyone knows that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's army and a heroic army because its first characteristic is that it is the army led by the advanced party of the modern proletariat—the Chinese Communist Party. With the leadership of the Party, we have everything for the People's Army, which has made our army the best army in Chinese history. With the leadership of the Party, our army has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, becoming an invincible heroic force invincible in the world. The film "Company Commander Guan" attempts to introduce the excellent qualities and heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army to the audience through a company participating in the liberation of Shanghai during the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army crossing the Yangtze River, but it ignores the characteristic that this troop is led by the Party. In the activities of this so-called "heroic" company, the leadership and fortress role of the Party branch in the company is not visible, the political work system of the People's Liberation Army is not visible, and the power of political work, which is the lifeline of the People's Liberation Army, is not demonstrated; on the contrary, the leading core and model Party member image of the company is a company commander Guan who does not understand or value the leading role of the branch, and uses the individual activities of Company Commander Guan to represent the leadership of the Party and monopolize political work. This phenomenon is not allowed in our troops. The film also mistakenly portrays the political worker in the company as an dispensable supporting character, and even at critical moments (such as writing blood letters to request battle – a method that has been criticized in the troops, and violating organizational discipline), the political instructor, as the political and ideological leader in the company, becomes the tail of the company commander and the masses, which is extremely incorrect. This is a distortion of the image and role of the political worker of the People's Liberation Army, and of the relationship between military and political cadres in the People's Liberation Army company. Our troops are troops led by the Party, but the film does not mention the advanced role of Communist Party members in the company, and the role of Party members and the relationship between the Party and the masses are written in a mess. For example, in a description of soldiers washing their feet, the casual complaints, unprincipled quarrels, non-Party members talking to Party members as "you" and "us," the estrangement and opposition of the Party-masses relationship, mutual exposure of "secrets," and the extremely vulgar words of Party members apologizing to old-timers for pouring foot-washing water every day, and the Communist Party members portrayed in the film have become people who discuss right and wrong and violate mass discipline (all three who violated discipline are Party members). Are these not distortions of the Communist Party members in the People's Liberation Army?

    Secondly, the film "Company Commander Guan" portrays the People's Liberation Army as a crude, uncultured, and lacking-in-wisdom troop. The film begins with a scene of low cultural activities in our troops. The workers and peasants in the company, led by Company Commander Guan, are almost illiterate. While satirizing intellectuals for not proceeding from reality, the author also ridicules our troops, portraying our cultural learning as unorganized, unled, and unplanned, organizing the troops' cultural learning into something like "the advanced literacy group listening to hero stories," and the illiterate as the "low-level group." It seems that only after the new intellectual cultural instructor came, did he bring "culture" and leadership of cultural learning to the troops. The film regards Company Commander Guan's advocacy of the method of "learning whatever you see" as a new invention, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the situation of cultural education in the People's Liberation Army. In fact, the period after the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River as shown in the film, not to mention the model company of the field army, even the ordinary company of the local armed forces would not have such a low cultural level. Since Chairman Mao built the army in Jinggangshan, we have regarded learning culture as an indispensable subject in the troops, and the method of "learning whatever you see" already existed in the Red Army era. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the soldier Zhang Youchi of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Garrison Troops better developed this method, and the whole army promoted this learning method. And when the Liberation War launched a major counter-offensive and approached victory, many units already had a more complete and formal class-based learning system and learning method, and the method of "learning whatever you see" was no longer the main one. Therefore, the "Model Company" represented by Company Commander Guan would never be as low in cultural level as shown in the film. What is most inappropriate is that the film deliberately exaggerates this aspect and ignores that the educational work in the troops is conducted with leadership, organization, and planning; the leadership actually allows the newly enlisted cultural instructor to talk to the soldiers about "worldview" and philosophy, which is unfounded. Such courses have never been in our company's cultural courses, and when such courses are taught to cadres in organs, they are taught by responsible cadres and comrades with higher political levels, and will never be taught by a new intellectual who has not yet come into contact with reality. In this way, the film on the one hand exaggeratedly satirizes the shortcomings of the new intellectuals' detachment from reality, and at the same time ridicules the stupidity and backwardness of the vast number of soldiers led by Company Commander Guan, arbitrarily ignoring the glorious tradition of our troops in the leadership of cultural learning. In addition to learning culture, many other descriptions of Company Commander Guan's actions, soldiers' dialogues, and company life situations do not vividly depict our army's style of unity, tension, liveliness, seriousness, neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness, but instead make Company Commander Guan and many soldiers look like slovenly, wearing hats crookedly, not paying attention to hygiene, and not paying attention to military discipline; the guards watching the prisoners do not salute when taking over, but bow to each other; the company commander cannot even speak a military term well in exercises and combat command; when giving orders, he still uses "俺" instead of "我". And the company commander himself said that when watching the performance of "The White Haired Girl", he actually shot at the stage! It seems to tell the audience that our soldiers are just a chaotic team of people from the peasant class, gathered for that small piece of land! Obviously, such a description is a manifestation of a fundamental lack of understanding of the essence of our troops.

    It should be understood that another characteristic of the People's Liberation Army is that it is a troop with ideology and lofty ideals. This army has the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and runs through the education of patriotism and internationalism. Every soldier can consciously understand why they are fighting and understand the present and future of the Chinese revolution. The class consciousness of the vast number of commanders and fighters in our army is not based on the ideology of the peasants, nor on the standard of tightly grasping their small piece of land, but on the standard of advanced revolutionary fighters with proletarian consciousness. The vast number of commanders and fighters of the battle-hardened Chinese People's Liberation Army are tempered and growing on the basis of this class consciousness. Our people's soldiers not only have the greatest courage, but also have the highest wisdom. We are a team armed with Mao Zedong's political line and Mao Zedong's military thought. We are a brave and good-at-fighting team, as well as an organized, disciplined, and highly cultured troop, and our wisdom and culture are improving and developing day by day with the needs of the struggle. The heroic image of our people's soldiers must have these characteristics. In the film "Company Commander Guan", the descriptions of our troops' life and Company Commander Guan's combat command do not show these. From the film, we cannot see the wisdom of "Company Commander Guan," who is a heroic image of a junior commander of the People's Liberation Army, nor can we see the wisdom of the vast number of soldiers (in fact, the "Zhuge Liang Meeting," "Brainstorming Meeting," and "Sand Table Exercise" (Note) before the battle that exist in our troops, the detailed reconnaissance situation during the battle, and the "Democratic Evaluation of Battle Achievements" after the battle... are all creations of the masses). The film only emphatically describes the "writing blood letters" movement and the spirit of struggle of not being afraid of sacrifice by the company led by Company Commander Guan in requesting meritorious service, but ignores the necessary preparations of this company before the battle, and does not carefully investigate the terrain and understand the enemy's situation during the battle. When the battle is about to end, Company Commander Guan does not take control of the company to complete the task, but rushes up the stairs alone to search for the remaining enemies and is shot and killed by a hidden gun. This method of combat does not conform to our army's tactical thinking, and the conditions for Company Commander Guan's sacrifice are neither specific nor sufficient. How can this show the wisdom that a heroic company commander should have? If such a "heroic" company as depicted in the film is used to represent a typical company of the People's Liberation Army when attacking Shanghai, what impression will it give people? Obviously, such troops could not defeat and eliminate the Chiang bandit army supported by US imperialism in a short period of time and achieve the great victory of the Liberation War. This company can not only not become a typical heroic company of the People's Liberation Army, but also lags behind ordinary companies. To crown such a troop without a high degree of organizational discipline, without cultural education, and without combat art as a "Model" company is a great distortion of our battle-hardened Chinese People's Liberation Army, the heroic troops who crossed the Yangtze River to liberate Shanghai, and the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army.

    Again, it should also be pointed out that the film "Company Commander Guan" does not show that our army is a troop with a high degree of centralized organization and discipline, but has many descriptions of unorganized and undisciplined phenomena. First of all, Company Commander Guan is described as an almost arbitrary and dictatorial person. When requesting combat missions, he repeatedly and impatiently makes requests in front of the regimental leaders, does not obey the distribution, and in order to compete for credit for his own company, he can propose to transfer other companies (Seven and Nine Company) back, and coerce the leadership by writing blood letters to confront the superiors. The film shows these without strongly criticizing them, and in public mass occasions, it also shows the soldiers publicly discussing the conversations of the superiors, such as "The superiors think our Eight Company is useless," "The superiors are making fun of us!" etc. Is this still called the People's Army? Where is the conscious and high degree of organizational discipline of the People's Army?

    The third characteristic of the People's Liberation Army is that it has a high degree of democratic centralism of organization and discipline. On the one hand, there is a democratic system under centralized guidance to give full play to the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses; on the other hand, there is a high degree of centralized discipline on the basis of democracy. The combination of this democratic system and a high degree of centralized organization and discipline enables us to maintain our high combat effectiveness in any situation of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the military and the people. However, the film "Company Commander Guan" portrays the democratic life of the People's Liberation Army under a high degree of centralized guidance as the backward and undisciplined behavior of petty-bourgeois peasants, and our troops' unity between officers and soldiers as vulgar and casual: the company commander holds a chamber pot, carrying two large packages, and no one among the many soldiers around him goes to take it; the democratic life of the masses is written as casually speaking ill of the superiors, not abiding by discipline, and after the company commander severely criticizes three soldiers, the soldiers immediately raise their opinions to the company commander face to face. Because the soldiers raised their opinions, the company commander immediately gave the soldiers two packs of cigarettes!... Such "democratic life" does not touch the real essence of our troops' democratic centralism, but instead creates lax discipline and weakens the troops' combat effectiveness. When the People's Liberation Army launched large-scale corps operations around the time of crossing the Yangtze River in 1949, is it conceivable that such a troop with lax discipline as shown in "democratic life" would have achieved a large number of victories in annihilating the enemy? Obviously, that is impossible. Our troops are not such troops. A high degree of centralized organization and discipline is an indispensable part of the People's Liberation Army's combat effectiveness. In addition, in expressing the characteristics of people's war, it should not only show that the People's Liberation Army comes from the people, for the people, and serves the people, but also must show that the people enthusiastically support us, help us, and show the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army relying closely on the masses, otherwise victory is impossible. And what else does the film "Company Commander Guan" show besides Company Commander Guan rolling and playing with children on the ground, or women and children sending off the troops?

    The People's Liberation Army is the people's army and a heroic army because it has the characteristics mentioned above. These characteristics are interconnected and indispensable. The last two characteristics show the characteristic of proletarian leadership. The typical heroic image of the People's Liberation Army must concentrate on expressing these. If there is no proletarian leadership, that is, if there is no leadership of the Communist Party over the troops, there would be no excellent essence of the People's Liberation Army serving the people and the image of great revolutionary heroes. The film "Company Commander Guan" has failed to concentrate on expressing these characteristics, and has seriously distorted and obliterated these characteristics. Therefore, the Company Commander Guan it塑造 (shuzao) is not yet a heroic image of a great soldier of the People's Liberation Army, let alone the image of a model company and a heroic commander of the People's Liberation Army. It is not a heroic image of a proletarian revolutionary soldier, and it is even more inconsistent with the image of the world-famous Chinese People's Liberation Army that is defending the motherland, defending the Far East, and defending world peace today. On the contrary, it will spread an incorrect impression among the audience, making the audience think that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is such an unorganized, undisciplined, unthinking, uncultured, stupid and backward group. This is the serious harm of the film "Company Commander Guan".

    What caused the film workers of the film "Company Commander Guan" to distort the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army?

    Judging from the film, first of all, they do not understand the essence and characteristics of our People's Army. They only know that our soldiers are "soldiers", mainly from peasants, but they do not know that this is a completely new type of People's Army, which is led by the Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and has a high degree of organization, discipline, and cultural accomplishment. They have not deeply realized the lofty ideals and class feelings of the great soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and do not understand the great revolutionary heroism shown by the soldiers of working people's origin under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, they can only grasp some scattered and fragmentary superficial impressions, or even grasp some backward phenomena that need to be criticized, pile them up, and describe our army based on the petty-bourgeois imagination. They cannot distinguish between what is the main thing and what is the secondary thing in life; what is the surface phenomenon and what is the essence, so it is impossible to reflect the excellent essence of the People's Liberation Army and correctly shape the heroic image of the revolutionary soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

    Because they do not understand the thoughts and feelings of the people's soldiers, they cannot correctly describe our soldiers, but develop the backward and unhealthy things of the peasants, which are not needed by the theme. The more these things are visualized, the greater the distortion and misunderstanding of the essence of the People's Army. Although the directors and actors have made some formal (such as using Shandong dialect...) and some interesting acting skills, these are just to develop some aspects that are irrelevant to the theme, causing laughter from the audience. This of course also tells us that the creative method and expressive ability of all art workers are first of all a matter of thoughts and feelings. In addition, the creators of the film "Company Commander Guan" also showed an unserious creative attitude. It is said that the original work of "Company Commander Guan" (the novel - by Zhu Ding) wrote about trampling on farmland when arresting prisoners, but now it has been changed to trampling on farmland jokingly after exercises; when the company commander and soldiers talked, they smoked their own two packs of cigarettes, but it has been changed to the company commander immediately sending a pack of cigarettes to the soldiers after the soldiers raised their opinions, showing it as vulgar and unbearable, and the soldiers and Communist Party members are portrayed as slovenly and undisciplined. Many things that cater to the vulgar tastes of the audience are caused by overly careless and casual work attitude. These all damage the theme they intend to express.

    Of course, the reason why we point out the above mistakes and shortcomings is by no means to say that the directors of the film "Company Commander Guan" will never be able to produce good works that represent the thoughts and feelings of the people's soldiers in the future, but to say that their current efforts have not yet turned their intention to express workers, peasants, and soldiers into practical results. We ask them to earnestly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and change their thoughts and feelings and creative attitude from practice. The people are welcoming them to have good works in the future.

    Note: "Sand table operation" refers to a model in which soldiers study combat deployment before combat.

　　应该正确地塑造人民解放军的英雄形象！
    ——评影片《关连长》
    冯征
    我们热爱人民的电影艺术，特别热爱以反映和歌颂我人民解放军优良本质和伟大革命英雄主义的电影艺术。这是很可以理解的，因为我们有了这支中国共产党领导的、在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教养下、从战斗中成长起来的人民军队，才创造了我们中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，才创造了我们光辉的新中国。而电影工作者辛勤地塑造了人民军队的英雄形象，把这支全心全意为人民服务的军队的生活和历史，生动地搬在银幕上，毫无疑问，这对于胜利了的中国人民，特别是人民战士，是一个极大的鼓舞。
    上海文华影片公司新片《关连长》就是一部意图描写人民解放军优秀品质和伟大事迹的影片。它企图通过战斗英雄关连长和他领导的“模范连队”，来表现我军“来自人民，为了人民，服务人民”的本质；通过翻身农民出身的关连长，通过我军热爱孩子、英勇作战的题材，来塑造我军为人民的最大利益，不惜牺牲一切的革命英雄的典型形象。影片中还有着我军愉快的文化娱乐生活、文化学习、同志间互相友爱、关怀，和有关部队民主生活的批评与自我批评的描写………，这些对于不大熟悉我军内部生活的人们，当然都是新鲜的。《关连长》影片的作者，这种主观的意图和他们为拍制这部影片的努力，是好的，从这一方面来说，是应该受到鼓励的。但是由于这部影片在许多地方严重地歪曲和误解了我人民解放军的优秀本质和英雄形象，影片中所表现的部队、人物及其生活，和我们百炼成钢的中国人民解放军是极不相称的，它不仅不能收到主观意图所期望的效果，相反的，会在人民群众中给我们英雄的人民解放军散布一些坏的影响。因此，应该给以严正的批判。
    影片《关连长》怎样地歪曲了人民解放军的本质和革命英雄的形象呢？
    首先，它没有足够地表现中国共产党对人民解放军的领导，甚至歪曲和抹杀了党在我军中的领导作用。谁都知道：中国人民解放军所以是人民的军队和英雄的军队，它的第一个特点就是它是近代无产阶级的先进政党——中国共产党所领导的军队。有了党的领导，才有了人民军队的一切，才使我军成为中国历史上从来没有过的好军队。有了党的领导，才使我们的军队从无到有，从小到大，成为无坚不摧无攻不克的无敌于天下的英雄部队。影片《关连长》企图通过人民解放军百万雄师下江南时参加解放上海的一个连队，通过关连长向观众介绍人民解放军的优秀品质和英雄事迹，但是却忽视了这个部队是由党所领导的特点。在这个所谓“英雄”连队的活动中，看不见党的支部在连队中的领导和堡垒作用，看不见人民解放军的政治工作制度，没有表现出作为人民解放军生命线的政治工作的威力；相反地，作为连队领导核心和模范党员形象的却是一个不了解与不重视支部领导作用的关连长，以关连长的个人活动来代表党的领导和包办政治工作，这种现象在我们部队中是不允许存在的。影片又错误地把连队中的政治工作人员描写为一个可有可无的陪衬人物，甚至在重要的关头（如写血书请战——这在部队里是已经被批评了的方式，及违犯组织纪律时）作为连队中的政治思想领导者的政治指导员，竟成为连长和群众的尾巴，这是极不正确的。这对于人民解放军政治工作人员的形象和作用，对于人民解放军连队中军事政治干部的关系，是歪曲了的。我们的部队是党所领导的部队，但影片中关于共产党员在连队中的先进作用没有提到，而且把党员的作用和党群关系写得一团糟，像战士们洗脚时的一段描写，那种随便发牢骚、非原则的争吵、非党员与党员讲着“你们”“我们”，党群关系的隔阂对立，互相揭“底子”，以及党员拿每天倒洗脚水来向老油子陪罪的极端庸俗的话，而影片中所表现的共产党员，都成了议论是非、违犯群众纪律的人（三个违犯纪律的全是党员），难道这些不是对人民解放军中共产党员的歪曲吗？
    其次，影片《关连长》把人民解放军描写为粗鲁的、没有文化教养和缺乏智慧的部队。影片是以我们部队文化活动低下的场面开始的，以关连长为首的连队中工农的战士们，差不多都不识什么字，作者讽刺知识分子不从实际出发的同时，也嘲笑了我们的部队，把我们的文化学习描写成没有组织、没有领导、没有计划，把部队文化学习组织编成什么“识字的高级组听讲英雄故事”，不识字的是“低级组”，似乎只有在新知识分子的文化教员来了之后，才给部队带来了“文化”和文化学习的领导。影片把关连长提倡的什么“见啥学啥”的方法，看成是新发明，这根本不符合于人民解放军文化教育的情况。事实上，影片上所显示的人民解放军百万雄师渡长江以后的时期，不用说是野战军的模范连队，就是地方武装的普通连队，它的文化水平也不会如此低下的。我们部队从井岗山毛主席建军伊始，就把学习文化当成部队中不可缺少的课目之一，而“见啥学啥”的方法早在红军时代就有，抗战时期陕甘宁留守部队的战士张友池更好地发挥了这种方法，全军中并曾推广了这种学习方法。而当解放战争大举反攻和接近胜利的时候，许多单位都已有了一种比较完整和正规编班的学习制度和学习方法，“见啥学啥”的方法已经不是主要的了。因此，以关连长为代表的“模范连队”，绝不会像影片所显示的文化水平那样的低下，最不应该的是影片还故意夸大了这一方面，忽视了部队中的教育工作是有领导、有组织、有计划进行的；领导上竟让新参军的文化教员对战士大讲什么“宇宙观”和哲学，这是毫无根据的。这种课程在我们连队的文化课程中从来是没有过的，而在机关干部中进行这类课程的讲授时，也是由负责干部和政治水平较高的同志讲授，绝不会让一个尚未接触实际的新知识分子来讲。这样影片一方面夸大地讽刺了新知识分子脱离实际的缺点，同时也嘲笑了以关连长为首的广大战士的愚蠢及落后，武断地无视了我们的部队对文化学习领导上的光荣传统。除开学文化以外，其他有关描写关连长的许多动作，战士们的对话，连队生活情况，都没有生动地描写我军团结、紧张、活泼、严肃、整齐、清洁、简单、朴素的作风，却把关连长和许多战士都弄成吊儿浪当、歪戴帽子、不讲卫生，不讲军风纪的样子；看守俘虏卫兵接哨不行军礼，而互相鞠躬；连长在演习和作战指挥中连个军语也说不好；下命令时还用“俺”不用“我”。而连长自述在看《白毛女》演出时，他竟向舞台上打了枪！似乎要告诉给观众说：我们的战士只是一群出身于农民阶级，为了那么一小块土地而集合起来的杂乱的队伍！显然，这样的描写，是根本对我们部队的本质认识不足的表现。
    应该了解：人民解放军的另一个特点，就是它是有思想的、同时也就是有崇高理想的部队，这个军队有着马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的教育，贯串了关于爱国主义与国际主义的教育，每一个战士都能够自觉地懂得他们是为什么打仗，懂得中国革命的现在和将来。我军广大指战员的阶级觉悟不是以农民的思想为标准，不是以用手紧抓着他那小块土地为标准，而是以具有无产阶级觉悟的先进革命战士的觉悟为标准。百炼成钢的中国人民解放军广大指战员在这种阶级觉悟的基础之上，在战斗中锻炼和成长着。我们的人民战士不仅有着最大的勇敢，而且有着最高的智慧，我们是毛泽东的政治路线和毛泽东的军事思想所武装起来的队伍，我们是勇敢善战的队伍，也是有组织有纪律的和有高度文化教养的部队，而且我们的智慧和文化在随着斗争的需要，一天天进步发展。我们人民战士的英雄形象必须具有这些特色。影片《关连长》中，关于我们部队生活和关连长作战指挥的描写，并没有表现这些。从影片中没有看出来作为人民解放军初级指挥员英雄形象“关连长”的智慧，也没有看出广大战士群众的智慧（事实上存在于我们部队中的战前“诸葛亮会”“想办法会”“沙盘作业”（注），战中的细密侦察情况，战后的“战绩民主评定”……都是群众的创造）。影片只强调地描写了以关连长为首的连队立功请战的“写血书”运动和不怕牺牲的斗争勇气，但忽略了这个连队战前应有的准备，战中也没有精心地调查地形，了解敌情，战斗快要结束时，关连长不去掌握连队完成任务，竟一个人冲上楼梯搜索残敌，被暗枪击中而牺牲了。这种作战的方法并不符合我军的战术思想，关连长牺牲的条件，既不够具体，也不够充分，这怎么能表现一个英雄连长应有的智慧呢？如果以影片所描写的这样的“英雄”的连队，来代表进攻上海时人民解放军的一个典型连队，将给人们以什么印象呢？显然，这样的部队是不可能在短时间中打败与消灭了以美帝国主义所支持的蒋匪军，取得了解放战争伟大胜利的。这个连队不仅不能成为人民解放军典型的英雄的连队，而且也落后于一般的连队，把这样一个没有高度的组织纪律性、没有文化教养、没有作战艺术的部队，封为“模范”连队，这对于我们百炼成钢的中国人民解放军，对于百万雄师渡过长江解放上海的英雄部队，对人民解放军的英雄形象是种很大的歪曲。
    再次，也要指出，影片《关连长》没有表现出我军是一个有高度集中的组织性和纪律性的部队，却有着许多无组织无纪律现象的描写。首先关连长就被描写成为一个近乎独断专横的人物。而在请求战斗任务时又是三番五次地在团首长面前，急躁提出要求，不听从分配，为了自己连队争功，可以提出将别的连队（七、九连）调回来，并且以写血书要挟领导，来和上级对抗。影片表现了这些，并没有有力地批判这些，而在公开的群众场合又表演了战士们公开议论上级的谈话，什么“上级看咱八连是废物”，“上级拿我们开心！”等等，这还叫人民的军队吗？人民军队自觉的高度的组织性纪律性在那里呢？
    人民解放军的第三个特点，就是有着高度的民主集中的组织性和纪律性。一方面有集中指导下的民主制度，以高度发挥群众的自觉性和积极性；一方面又有民主基础上的高度集中性的纪律，这种民主制度和高度集中的组织性和纪律性相结合，使我们能在任何情况下官兵团结、军民团结保持自己高度的战斗力。然而影片《关连长》却把人民解放军高度集中指导下的民主生活，描写成农民小资产阶级落后散漫，把我们部队的官兵一致表现为庸俗的随随便便：连长端尿盆，扛着两个大包袱，周围许多战士竟无一人去接一接；把群众的民主生活，写成随便讲上级怪话，不守纪律，在连长严肃地批评了三个战士以后，战士马上对连长又当面提出了意见，由于战士提意见，而连长马上就给了战士两包烟！……这样的“民主生活”没有接触到我们部队的真正民主集中的实质，相反是造成纪律松弛，削弱了部队的战斗力。当一九四九年人民解放军渡江前后的大兵团作战时，能够设想，这样“民主生活”所表现的、纪律松弛的部队，会获得大量歼灭敌人的胜利吗？显然，那是不可能的。我们的部队不是这样的部队。高度集中的组织纪律是人民解放军战斗力不可缺少的组成部分。此外，在表现人民战争的特点上，不仅应该表现人民解放军来自人民，为了人民，服务人民，而且必须表现人民热烈地支援我们，帮助我们，表现人民解放军紧紧依靠群众的特点，否则胜利是不可能的。而影片《关连长》除了表现关连长和小孩在地上滚打着玩，或妇女儿童欢送部队之外又表现了什么呢？
    人民解放军所以是人民的部队，英雄的部队，就是因为它具备了上面举过的那些特点，这些特点，互相联系缺一不可，而后两个特点正表现了无产阶级领导的这一特点。人民解放军典型的英雄形象，必须集中地表现这些，假如没有无产阶级领导，也就是说没有共产党对部队的领导，就不会有人民解放军为人民服务的优良本质和伟大革命英雄的形象。影片《关连长》正由于没有集中地表现了这些特点，而且严重地歪曲和抹杀了这些特点，因此它所塑造的关连长还不可能是人民解放军伟大战士的英雄形象，更不是人民解放军模范连队和英雄指挥员的形象，不是无产阶级革命战士的英雄形象，和今天正在保卫祖国、保卫远东与世界和平的举世闻名的中国人民解放军的形象更是不相称的。恰恰相反，会在观众中散播一种不正确的印象，使观众以为中国人民解放军就是这样一个无组织，无纪律，无思想，无文化，愚蠢而落后的集团。这就是《关连长》这一影片的严重的害处。
    什么原因使影片《关连长》的电影工作者歪曲了人民解放军的英雄形象呢？
    从影片上来看，首先是他们对我们人民军队的本质和特点不了解，他们只知道我们的战士是“兵”，是主要的来自农民，却不知道这是一支完全新型的人民军队，是由共产党领导、有马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想所武装的有高度组织性纪律性和文化修养的军队。他们没有深深体会到人民解放军伟大战士的远大理想和阶级情感，不懂得劳动人民出身的战士在党的领导下所表现的伟大的革命英雄主义，因此只能抓一些零乱和片断的皮毛印象，甚至是抓取一些落后的需要批判的现象，堆砌起来，凭着小资产阶级的臆想，来描写我们军队。他们分辨不出生活中那些是主要的，那些是次要的东西；那些是表面现象，那些是本质，也就不可能反映出人民解放军的优良本质和正确地塑造出人民解放军革命战士的英雄形象来。
    由于他们对于人民战士的思想情感的不了解，因此，也就不可能正确地描写我们的战士，而把农民落后的、和不健康的，为主题思想所不需要的东西加以发挥，这些东西愈形象化，所产生的对人民军队本质的歪曲和误解就愈大。尽管编导和演员以若干形式上（如用山东方言……）和一些趣味上演技上的加工，这只是发挥些和主题不相干的方面，引起观众的哄笑。这当然也告诉我们：一切艺术工作者的创作方法和表现能力，首先是思想情感问题。此外，《关连长》电影的创作者也表现了不严肃的创作态度，据说《关连长》原作（小说——朱定作）写因抓俘虏踏坏农田，现在改成演习回来开玩笑踏坏农田；把连长和战士谈话时抽完了自己的两包烟，却改成战士向连长提了意见之后，连长马上送一包烟给战士们，表现为庸俗不堪，把战士和共产党员演成吊儿浪当，军风纪不整的人物以及不少迎合观众庸俗趣味的东西，都是过分疏忽与随便的工作态度所造成的，这些都损害着他们自己所意图表现的主题思想。
    当然，我们所以指出以上的错误和缺点，绝不是说影片《关连长》的编导者今后就再也不可能搞出代表人民战士思想情感的好作品出来，而是说，目前他们的努力，还没有把自己表现工农兵的意图变成实际的效果。要求他们认真地向工农兵学习，从实践中在思想情感和创作态度上加以改变，人民正欢迎他们今后能有良好的作品出现。
