　　Chinese Christians Rise Up to Fully Support the Chinese and Korean People's Forces
　　Chinese People's Delegation to Korea Members, Christians Chen Yisheng Xiao Jing Tian Changqing Xu Xuehai
　　We four Christians were honored to participate in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, representing the people of the motherland to pay the highest respects and condolences to our Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. During our month in Korea, we personally witnessed our Volunteer Army standing at various combat posts, engaged in a resolute struggle against the enemy for the independence of the Korean nation, for the security of the motherland and the happy lives of the people, and for the defense of world peace. They displayed selfless heroism and overcame the brutal enemy with extraordinary wisdom and iron will. In several battles, they have already annihilated nearly 200,000 troops of the aggressors headed by the United States. This army of the Chinese and Korean people, inspired by great patriotic enthusiasm and a lofty sense of justice, is the defender of peace and happiness for our two great nations and the people of the world, and an invincible iron army that will defeat US imperialism.
　　During the month in Korea, what aroused our unparalleled anger was the US imperialists' shameless massacre, bombing, and rape of the Korean people's bloody crimes. According to incomplete statistics, in Hwanghae Province, 100,000 people were victimized. In Sinchon County of that province, the enemy killed 3,500 people, including 76 children from one to six years old who were locked in a house; the children's mothers were locked in another room, doused with gasoline, and burned to death. A small window was opened in the room where the children were locked, and the children crowded at the window, hungrily yearning for their mothers' nourishment, and died of starvation in this way. When the enemy retreated from Pyongyang, they forced the Korean people to retreat, but when the refugees reached the Daedong River Bridge, the bridge was blown up by the enemy. This time, more than 2,000 innocent men and women were killed. From the enemy's positions, from the captured tanks, the bodies of Korean women who had been raped and murdered could be found at any time. In the Xinjiang Township (belonging to Jiangxi County, equivalent to our district) which we visited, the enemy massacred 963 people in a long trench in the six days from November 25th to 30th. When we went there in mid-April, we could still smell the stench of corpses more than half a kilometer away; in the trench, there remained the tragic limbs, intestines, blood-stained clothes, mothers' shoes and socks, and children's backpacks of the dead. Comrade Park Meng-sil, the labor party secretary of the township who led us to see this crime, told us that twenty-one of his family of twenty-two had been slaughtered. His experience made us more deeply realize that our great war of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is just, lofty, for the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people, and for the defense of world peace and the happiness of all mankind. On the other hand, the enemy's atrocities also filled us with unparalleled anger towards Truman, Dulles, and MacArthur, who constantly talk about God. This small group of wolves in sheep's clothing, sucking human blood, are inhuman people. They are not only not Christians, they are wolves more brutal than wolves, and beasts more shameless than beasts!
　　What makes us even more angry is that the enemy insulted Christianity and used Christianity as one of the shameful tools of aggression. In the army of the aggressors headed by the United States, more than 90% believe in Christianity, and every soldier has an amulet with the words: "Anyone who wears this amulet will not be injured by the enemy's guns and cannons, and God will grant him divine power, and all artillery fire and swords will lose their effectiveness in front of him!" The most common picture seen from the prisoners shows an American flag with Jesus standing in front of the flag, and soldiers standing in front of Jesus holding guns and charging forward! This is how US imperialism has insulted our sacred faith, insulting Christ as a war criminal like Truman, Dulles, MacArthur and Ridgway. In the invading army, there are also chaplains who preach, which is a great irony to the church and missionaries controlled by imperialism! These chaplains try to give the soldiers of the invading army some peace of mind after they have massacred innocent people and destroyed the peaceful people's fields and homes; they try to make them believe that they can still enter heaven with cruel and licentious hearts and hands stained with the blood of innocent people. Not only that, but these chaplains also often check the soldiers' thoughts, and when they find that the soldiers are skeptical about the war of aggression, they report to the army's intelligence agencies at any time. In the areas that had been occupied by the enemy, taking Longgang County, which we visited, as an example, the US-Li bandit army used the scum among the Christians to organize reactionary security teams to capture and kill Korean patriots, and threatened the Korean people with bayonets, saying: "If you don't enter the church and don't believe in Christianity, you are guilty!" These peaceful people who were forced to accept the Christian faith were driven by the enemy to carry out espionage work to undermine the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, in the cities of Pyongyang, Sariwon, Anju, and Sinuiju that we passed through, the churches in every place were bombed into ruins. Christians were also massacred, and female Christians were also raped. These bloody facts have educated Korean Christians more clearly about the hideous face of US imperialism. These bloody facts have awakened Korean Christians, and they are defending their country together with their people. Some pastors donate airplanes; some young believers join the guerrillas, join the People's Army, and participate in nursing work. Korean Christians are dedicating their strength and even their lives to the various combat posts of defending their country! These facts have also deeply educated us that it is absolutely impossible to separate loving the church from loving the motherland. Without an independent, strong, and prosperous motherland, there can be no sacred and pure faith. To be a true Christian who loves his brothers, today he must participate in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect his home and defend his country with all his strength, to eliminate the aggressive forces of US imperialism.
　　Therefore, we suggest to Christians across the country:
　　1. Now that the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has returned to the motherland, it has been decided to go to 2,050 counties across the country to report to the people of the country, to carry out patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea more deeply, to further mobilize and organize the people of the country to support the front line and smash the aggressive army of US imperialism. The co-workers and fellow believers of every local church and church organization should actively prepare to welcome the representatives of the delegation, organize believers to hold meetings, and invite the representatives of the delegation to report, so that the believers and fellow believers across the country can deeply experience the lofty internationalism and patriotism of our Volunteer Army after hearing the report, and implement this spirit in the accusation movement that is being carried out today, and thoroughly eliminate the various influences of imperialism in the church for more than a century.
　　2. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Korean people's war of resistance against the United States will surely achieve the final and complete victory. But this enemy is the last and most stubborn in the imperialist camp, and he temporarily has an advantage in weapons. Therefore, the people of the country have launched a large-scale movement to donate airplanes and artillery to enable our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to eliminate the enemy more and faster. We Christians must respond to the call of the China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association with practical actions, launch a movement to donate airplanes and artillery, and regard the current donation movement as an important task in the current stage of the patriotic movement, and we should continue to sign patriotic covenants and check patriotic covenants, and do a good job in the movement to give preferential treatment to military families and martyrs' families. We should provide strong support in terms of manpower, medicines, and equipment to the Chinese Christian medical team to Korea which is about to depart.
　　3. We must resolutely realize what was called for in the joint declaration of the Chinese Christian churches and organizations on April 25: sever all ties between Chinese Christianity and imperialism; at the same time, strengthen patriotic education and eliminate all remaining influences of imperialism in the church.
　　The great patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is also a movement to transform the thinking of the people of the country. In this movement, we must eliminate the spiritual poisoning that imperialism has long carried out against us by using Christianity, and sweep away the reactionary political propaganda that promotes Christians' supra-politics and supra-nationalism. Let us carry forward our love in the great and sacred cause of defending the motherland, defending peace, and eliminating the aggressive forces of US imperialism!
　　Finally, we call on every believer to specifically stipulate these tasks in their patriotic covenant. Let the patriotic covenant with rich content become the program of our patriotic actions. We must support our Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people with the highest enthusiasm and loyalty until the US imperialist aggressive army is finally eliminated and the war of resistance against the US achieves the final victory!

　　中国的基督徒起来全力支援中朝人民部队
    中国人民赴朝慰问团团员、基督徒  陈巳生  萧静  田常青  徐学海
    我们四位基督徒，这次光荣地参加中国人民赴朝慰问团，代表祖国人民向我们的志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民致最高的敬礼和慰问。在朝鲜的一个月中，我们亲自看到站在各个战斗岗位上的我们的志愿军，为朝鲜民族的独立、为保卫祖国的安全与人民的幸福生活、为保卫全世界的和平，同敌人进行了坚决的斗争。他们发挥了忘我的英雄气概，以卓越的智慧和钢铁的意志战胜了残暴的敌人。在几次战役中，已经消灭了近二十万人以美国为首的侵略者的军队。这一支为伟大的爱国热诚和崇高的正义感所鼓舞的中朝人民军队，是我们两个伟大民族和全世界人民和平幸福的捍卫者，是战胜美帝国主义的一支无敌的铁军。
    在朝鲜一个月中，引起我们无比愤怒的是美帝国主义对朝鲜人民无耻地屠杀、轰炸和奸淫的血腥罪行。据不完全的统计，在黄海道，有十万人民被残害。在该道信川郡敌人杀了三千五百人，这里有从一岁到六岁的七十六个儿童被关在屋里；孩子的母亲则关在另一间屋子，被洒上汽油全体焚死。关着孩子的房间开了一个小窗，孩子们饥饿地挤在窗口渴望着母亲的哺养，就这样饥饿地死去。在敌人从平壤撤退时，强迫着朝鲜人民撤退，而当难民走到大同江桥上时，桥梁却被敌人炸毁了。这一次就有二千多名无辜的男女被杀害。从敌人阵地里，从缴获的坦克中，随时可发现被奸污后杀害的朝鲜妇女的尸体。在我们访问过的农村新井面（属于江西郡，相当于我们的区）的一个长形战壕中，敌人在十一月二十五日至三十日这六天，就屠杀了九百六十三人，直到四月中旬我们去时，远在一里以外还可以嗅到尸体的臭味；战壕中保留有惨不忍睹的死人的肢体、肠胃、血衣，母亲的鞋袜，孩子的背包。领着我们看这罪行的该面劳动党书记朴孟实同志告诉我们，他的全家二十二口被屠杀了二十一口。他的遭遇使我们更深刻地体会到我们抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大战争是正义的，是崇高的，是为了中朝人民的幸福，为了保卫世界和平和全人类的幸福。而另一面，敌人的暴行也使我们对口口声声讲着上帝的杜鲁门、杜勒斯和麦克阿瑟有着无比的愤怒。这一小撮披着羊皮、吸着人血的豺狼，他们是没有人性的人，他们不仅不是基督徒，他们是比豺狼还残暴的豺狼，是比禽兽更无耻的禽兽！
    使我们更愤怒的是敌人侮辱了基督教，把基督教当作了可耻的侵略工具之一。在以美国为首的侵略者的军队中，有百分之九十以上是信仰基督教的，每一个士兵身上都有一个护身符，上面写着“凡佩有此符者就不会被敌人的枪炮所击伤，上帝会赐予他以神力，一切炮火和刀剑都在他面前失去效力！”从俘虏那里看到的最普遍的一张画片，上面有一副美国旗，旗前面站着耶稣，士兵站在耶稣前面托着枪向前冲杀！美帝国主义就是这样侮辱了我们圣洁的信仰，把基督侮辱为像杜鲁门、杜勒斯、麦克阿瑟和李奇微一样的战争罪犯。在侵略军中，还有随军牧师进行宣教，这真是对帝国主义控制下的教会和传教士的绝大讽刺！这些随军牧师企图使侵略军的士兵们，在屠杀无辜的人民、破坏和平人民的田园和家乡后，得到一些良心的安慰；企图使他们相信他们还能够带着残暴和荒淫无耻的心、带着涂满无辜人民的鲜血的双手进入天堂。不仅如此，那些随军牧师并且经常检查士兵的思想，发现士兵对侵略战争怀疑时，就随时向军队的情报机关作报告。在曾被敌人占领的地区，就以我们去访问过的龙岗郡为例，美李匪军利用基督徒中败类，组织反动的治安队，捕杀朝鲜爱国者，并用刺刀威胁朝鲜人民说：“不进教堂，不信基督教，就有罪！”这些被迫接受基督教信仰的和平人民，敌人又驱使着他们去进行破坏朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的特务工作。同时，在平壤、沙里院、安州和新义州这些我们所经过的城市中，每一个地方的教堂都被炸成一片废墟。基督徒同样被屠杀，女基督徒同样被奸污。这些血的事实教育着朝鲜基督徒更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的狰狞面目。这些血的事实使朝鲜基督徒们觉醒了，他们正和自己的人民一起，保卫祖国。有的牧师捐献飞机；有的青年信徒参加游击队，参加人民军，参加护理工作等。朝鲜的基督徒们，在保卫祖国的各种战斗岗位上献出自己的力量甚至生命！这些事实，也深刻地教育了我们，爱教会和爱祖国是绝不可能分开的。没有独立、强盛和繁荣的祖国，就不可能有圣洁和纯真的信仰，作一个真正的爱弟兄的基督徒，今天就一定要以全力参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，来消灭美帝国主义的侵略势力。
    因此，我们向全国的基督徒建议：
    一、现在中国人民赴朝慰问团已回到祖国，决定到全国二千零五十个县去向全国人民传达报告，更深入地进行抗美援朝的爱国教育，把全国人民进一步动员起来，组织起来，支援前线，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略军。我们每一个地方教会和教会团体的同工同道，要积极准备迎接慰问团的代表，组织信徒群众召开大会，请慰问团的代表去报告，使全国的信徒同道们在听了报告后，能够深刻地体验我们志愿军的崇高的国际主义与爱国主义的精神，把这种精神贯彻到今天正在开展的控诉运动中，彻底肃清百多年来帝国主义在教会中的各种影响。
    二、我们坚决相信中朝人民的抗美战争一定会获得最后的彻底的胜利。但这个敌人是帝国主义阵营中最后最顽强的一个，在武器上他暂时占有优势，因此全国人民已展开大规模的捐献飞机大炮运动，使我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军更多更快地消灭敌人。我们基督徒要以实际行动，响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，展开捐献飞机大炮运动，要把当前捐献运动作为现阶段爱国运动中一项重要工作，并且应当再接再厉地普遍签订爱国公约和检查爱国公约，搞好优待军属烈属运动，对正要起程的中国基督徒赴朝医疗队，在人力上、药品上和器材上要作有力支援。
    三、我们要坚决实现四月二十五日中国基督教各教会各团体联合宣言中所号召的：割断中国基督教与帝国主义的一切联系；同时要加强爱国主义教育，肃清教会中帝国主义的一切残余影响。
    伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动，也是全国人民的思想改造运动。我们要在这个运动中清除帝国主义利用基督教对我们长期进行的精神毒害，把鼓吹基督徒超政治和超国家的反动政治宣传一扫而空。把我们的爱心在保卫祖国、保卫和平、消灭美帝侵略势力的伟大神圣事业中发扬光大！
    最后，我们号召每一个信徒要把这些工作在自己的爱国公约中具体规定出来。使具有丰富内容的爱国公约成为我们爱国行动的纲领。我们要以最高的热情和忠诚，支援我们的志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，直到美帝国主义侵略军最后被消灭，抗美战争得到最后胜利！
