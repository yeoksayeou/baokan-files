　　“Cotton Farmer Brothers, Sell the Cotton to the Nation!”
    Textile Workers Wang Deshan and Hang Peilan Write to Song Luoxue and Liu Honggang
    Wang Deshan, a model worker from the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and Hang Peilan, a model worker from the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, recently wrote letters to Song Luoxue, an agricultural labor model from Hebei, and Liu Honggang, a cotton planting model from Shandong, asking them to mobilize the peasant brothers to sell or deposit their cotton to the state as soon as possible; the yarn factory workers guarantee to produce more cotton yarn and cloth to supply the needs of the people throughout the country. The full text of the two letters is as follows:

Comrade Song Luoxue:

    Not long ago, I returned to Tianjin from convalescing in Beidaihe. Recently, I read in the People's Daily the news about your village selling cotton, and I was extremely happy. Our yarn factory has temporarily suspended production due to lack of cotton, but I have always believed that our peasant brothers will never stand idly by and watch us stop working without helping us. Now you have indeed quickly responded to the instructions of the Government Administration Council and the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and sold cotton to the state. Your patriotic action will surely drive peasant brothers all over the country to sell cotton, so that yarn factories across the country can resume work as soon as possible. And I also believe that our peasant brothers will work harder to expand the yield of cotton fields, so that our motherland will no longer have difficulties in supplying cotton. As long as our workers and peasants are united, we will not be afraid of the blockade of American imperialism. The blockade can only arouse our resentment and strengthen our fighting power. What other role does the blockade have besides this?

    Since we jointly participated in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, we have not seen each other for eight months. During these eight months, we have never stopped the patriotic labor competition. Our group has overfulfilled its production tasks every month, but we must continue to work hard and further improve our production, and fight to the end to build a strong industrialized China.

    This time, our yarn factory has suspended production, but we can still get 75% of our wages. The government also organizes us to study politics, culture, and technology, and sends special personnel to give us lessons. We have the Trade Union Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations. Our yarn factory has also established a workers' spare-time school. I didn't know a single word in the past, but now I have entered school and can understand newspapers.

    Since Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came, our workers have been liberated, and our peasant brothers have been given land, and the grain produced is no longer handed over to landlords. Our government cares about the interests of peasant brothers in every way. When peasant brothers are in difficulty, our government lends them seeds and farm tools. This year, the state has taken out a lot of money to repair the Huai River and eradicate floods. The government also stipulates reasonable listed prices for purchasing farmers' grain and cotton, ensuring farmers' interests. The situation of so-called "low grain prices hurting farmers" no longer exists.

    When I was convalescing in the beautiful bungalows of the Beidaihe seaside bath, sleeping in a steel-wire bed, looking at the fresh flowers on the table and the scenery outside the window, and the various gifts sent by the mayor of Qinhuangdao Municipal People's Government, I couldn't help but think about the past and look forward to the future. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, how could we have today? Therefore, how can we not love our country today? How can we not work hard to produce and defend our country? Today, our government calls on our peasant brothers to sell their cotton to the state, how can we not respond enthusiastically?

    Comrade Song Luoxue! I hope you will mobilize the peasant brothers to sell cotton to the state as soon as possible, and strive for a bumper harvest of cotton this year. I assure you that we will step up production to spin more and better yarn and cloth; and we will also work hard to reduce costs, so that our peasant brothers can buy cheap and good-quality cotton cloth!

    Our workers and peasants should unite closely and fight to defeat American imperialism and build a better country!

    Eagerly awaiting your reply!

        With best regards,
                      Labor Model of the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, Wang Deshan

Dear Comrade Liu Honggang:

    I am a female worker in a cotton textile factory in Shanghai. I am telling you an important thing. You know, most of the cotton textile factories in Shanghai have been shut down since the 6th of this month. Why shut down? Mainly because there is not enough cotton. Last year's cotton production almost doubled compared to the previous year, why is it still not enough? The reason is very simple. Since liberation, workers have been liberated, peasants have been liberated, land has been distributed, and prices are so stable, and life is getting better, everyone wants to make new clothes and change new quilts, so factories have to produce a lot of yarn and cloth, and the raw cotton is not enough. But at this time, some peasant brothers in cotton-producing areas are unwilling to sell their stored cotton, waiting to sell it at a higher price, which is so inappropriate!

    Let's think back, what kind of life did we workers and peasants live before liberation? The money earned by the workers was not even enough to eat, and the prices were rising like tides. The wages earned could buy two dou of rice, but when they got home, they could only buy one dou of rice. In the factory, they often suffered from anger and scolding, and there was no guarantee in their lives. The peasant brothers were the same. They were busy all day long, suffering all year long, but they still could not eat enough and wear warm clothes. They were oppressed and exploited so bitterly by the landlords! If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading our workers and peasants in the revolution, overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionaries, driving away American imperialism, and overthrowing the landlords and bullies, could we have been liberated? Can we have such a good life today? The People's Government under the leadership of Chairman Mao serves the people everywhere, helps us solve difficulties, and develops production, making our lives better day by day. Our relationship with the government is inseparable! Today, the government needs more cotton to manufacture a large amount of yarn and cloth to meet the needs of the laboring people throughout the country. Is it right for some peasant brothers not to sell their cotton? Can the peasant brothers tolerate American imperialism wanting to use the conspiracy of blockade to cause economic difficulties in our country?

    Comrade Liu Honggang, you are a cotton planting model, a leader of cotton farmer brothers. I hope you will explain the above reasoning in detail to the peasant brothers who are unwilling to sell cotton, and at the same time repeatedly publicize the government's policies to them, so that they will consciously and voluntarily sell cotton, reduce the government's temporary difficulties, and smash the blockade conspiracy of American imperialism. We believe that the peasant brothers are all patriotic. After they understand these principles, they will definitely take out the cotton. This is a big deal, and I believe you will be able to accept my request.

### “棉农弟兄们，把棉花卖给国家！”  纺织工人王德山杭佩兰致函宋洛学刘洪岗

　　“棉农弟兄们，把棉花卖给国家！”        
    纺织工人王德山杭佩兰致函宋洛学刘洪岗
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂劳动模范王德山、国营上海第一棉纺织厂劳动模范杭佩兰最近分别写信给河北农业劳动模范宋洛学、山东植棉模范刘洪岗，要求他们动员农民弟兄们把自己的存棉尽快拿出来卖给或存给国家；纱厂工人保证多产棉纱布匹供应全国人民的需要。两封信的全文如下：宋洛学同志：
    不久以前，我才从北戴河休养回天津。最近，我从人民日报上，读到了你们村子出卖棉花的消息，我高兴极了。我们纱厂因为没有棉花而暂时停工了，但是我始终相信：我们农民兄弟决不会眼睁睁地看着我们停工，而不帮助我们。现在你们果然很快地响应政务院的指示和中共中央的号召，把棉花卖给了国家。你们这一爱国行动，一定会带动全国农民兄弟，都把棉花卖出来，使全国纱厂早日复工。并且我还相信，我们农民兄弟更会努力扩大棉田的产量，使我们祖国不再有棉花供应的困难。只要我们工人农民团结一条心，我们决不害怕美帝国主义的封锁。封锁只能激起我们的愤恨，增强我们战斗的力量。除此而外，封锁还有什么作用呢？
    自从我们共同参加全国工农兵劳动模范会议以来，我们已有八个月不见面了。在这八个月当中，我们一直没有停止过爱国主义劳动大竞赛，我们的小组月月超额完成生产任务，但是我们还要加油干，把我们的生产再提高一步，为建立强大的工业化的中国而斗争到底。
    这一次，我们纱厂停工了，但是还能拿百分之七十五的工资，政府还组织我们学习政治、文化和技术，并且派专人给我们上课。我们有了工会法，又有了劳动保险条例。我们纱厂还设立了工人业余补习学校。我过去一个字都不识，如今我进了学校，也能看懂报纸了。
    自从毛主席和共产党来了，我们工人才翻了身，我们农民兄弟才分得了土地，种出来的粮食才不再交给地主。我们的政府处处关心农民兄弟的利益，在农民兄弟困难的时候，我们的政府就贷给农民种籽和农具。今年国家拿出很多的钱，修治淮河，根除水灾。政府还规定合理的牌价，收购农民的粮食和棉花，保证农民有利。过去所谓“谷贱伤农”的情况，已经不存在了。
    当我在北戴河海滨浴场美丽的洋房内休养的时候，身睡在钢丝床上，看着桌上的鲜花，和窗外的风景，以及秦皇岛市人民政府市长送我们的各种礼物。不由得想想过去，望望将来。如果没有毛主席和共产党，我们那能有今天？因此我们怎能不热爱今天的祖国呢？怎能不努力生产保家卫国呢？今天我们的政府号召我们农民兄弟把存棉卖给国家，我们又怎能不热烈响应呢？
    宋洛学同志！我希望你动员农民兄弟们赶快把棉花卖给国家，并努力争取今年棉花的丰收。我向你保证，我们一定加紧生产，纺织更多更好的纱布；并且我们还要努力减低成本，让我们农民兄弟们能买到价廉物美的棉布！
    我们工人农民应紧紧地团结起来，为打败美帝国主义，为建设美好的国家而斗争！
    热烈等待你的回信！
        此致敬礼
                      国营天津第二棉纺织厂劳动模范  王德山亲爱的刘洪岗同志：
    我是上海一个棉纺织厂的女工。我告诉你一件重要的事情。你知道吧，从本月六号起上海棉纺织厂大部分停工了。为什么要停工呢？主要因为棉花不够用。去年棉花产量差不多比前年增加一倍，为什么还不够用呢？原因很简单，解放以来工人翻了身，农民翻了身，分到了土地，物价又那么稳定，生活都好起来了，都要做新衣服，换新被子，工厂就得生产大量的纱和布，原棉就不够用了。可是在这个时候，产棉区某些农民兄弟却不肯出卖存棉，等着卖更高的价钱，这是多么不应该呀！
    我们回想一下吧，解放以前我们工人、农民过的是什么生活？工人赚来钱，本来连饭都不够吃，再加上物价像潮水一样上涨，拿到工钱本来可买二斗米，回到家里就只能买一斗米了。在工厂里还要常常受气挨骂，生活一点也没有保障。农民弟兄也是一样，一天忙到晚，一年苦到头，还是吃不饱，穿不暖，被地主压迫得好苦，剥削得好苦呀！要不是毛主席和共产党领导我们工人、农民革命，推翻了国民党反动派，赶走了美帝国主义，打倒地主恶霸，我们能够翻身吗？能有今天这样好日子吗？毛主席领导下的人民政府处处为人民服务，帮助我们解决困难，发展生产，使我们生活一天一天好起来。我们和政府是血肉难分的呀！今天政府需要更多棉花来制造大量纱和布，满足全国劳动人民的需要，有些农民弟兄不肯把棉花卖出，这是应该的吗？美帝国主义想用封锁的阴谋使我们国家的经济发生困难，农民弟兄能够容忍吗？
    刘洪岗同志，你是植棉模范，是棉农弟兄们的一个带头人，希望你把上面这番道理细细讲给不肯出卖棉花的农民弟兄听，同时向他们反复宣传政府的政策，使他们自觉自愿地把棉花卖出，减少政府的暂时困难，粉碎美帝国主义的封锁阴谋。我们相信农民兄弟都是爱国的，在他们懂得了这些道理后，他们一定会把棉花拿出来的。这是一件大事情，相信你一定能够接受我的要求。
                      国营上海第一棉纺织厂劳动模范  杭佩兰
