　　The artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in more than half a year of combat, have powerfully supported the Volunteer Army's infantry, inflicting heavy blows on the American invading army. With their bravery and skill, the artillerymen have overcome the enemy's artillery, which was superior in number.

　　In various campaigns, the Volunteer Army's artillery has exerted tremendous power, cooperating with the infantry to kill and wound a large number of enemies. In the blocking battle at Mao Luo Mountain north of Suwon, the Volunteer Army artillery used sixteen shells to kill and wound over seventy of the more than one hundred invading enemies. In many battles, the artillerymen, with their accurate and powerful shooting, opened up avenues of attack for the infantry. When capturing Height 400 west of Hengcheng, a certain artillery unit of the Volunteer Army hit the enemy so hard that they dared not raise their heads from the destroyed trenches. The Volunteer Army infantry cheered, "Accurate shooting! Let's give a merit to our artillery!" Taking advantage of the light from the exploding shells, the infantry rushed straight to the enemy's position along the path opened up by the artillery, and captured the height in fifteen minutes. Sometimes the artillerymen also penetrated to the enemy's flanks like the infantry to bombard the enemy. One night, Zhang Likun, the artillery company commander of a certain unit, and five soldiers moved a cannon to the left flank of the enemy's position, unexpectedly and fiercely firing on the enemy's motor vehicle parking lot, firing eighty shells in a row, destroying more than thirty enemy vehicles. By the time the enemy frantically concentrated more than ten cannons to counterattack, the brave men had victoriously returned to their original position with their cannon. In the battle of Moxi-ri south of Hengcheng, an observer of a certain artillery unit of the Volunteer Army discovered an enemy artillery position more than ten miles away on a hillside, with more than twenty howitzers deployed. The Volunteer Army artillerymen quickly pushed the cannons to favorable terrain, hurriedly built fortifications, and then accurately bombarded the enemy artillery. The enemy hurriedly organized artillery fire to counterattack, with shells raining down, and enemy planes also dispatched to reconnoiter, bomb, and strafe, but they never hit the Volunteer Army's artillery position. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy artillery could not hold out and hurriedly used vehicles to drag the cannons away, leaving behind three destroyed cannons and more than twenty corpses.

　　On April 22, in the powerful counterattack by the Chinese and Korean People's forces, a certain artillery unit of the Volunteer Army once again defeated the enemy's artillery, which was superior in number. The day before the counterattack was launched, the artillery commanders had already observed the enemy situation and terrain in front of them. At night, the artillerymen pulled their beloved cannons into position. They built ingenious and solid fortifications overnight and camouflaged the cannons one by one. The next day, enemy reconnaissance planes continuously circled and reconnoitered over the position, and enemy cannons also blindly fired randomly. The artillerymen said both angrily and amusedly: "You little bastards! Wait until dark to eat refreshments!" By 3:30 in the afternoon, although enemy planes were still circling overhead, the artillerymen had already aimed their dark cannons at the enemy. At 3:40, the order to fire came. In an instant, a earth-shattering sound burst forth in the valley, and rows of shells shot straight at the enemy's position. The enemy's artillery, which had been very rampant not long before, was suppressed into silence. Soon after, the enemy reorganized its artillery fire and counterattacked, with dense shells falling near the Volunteer Army artillery position. Smoke filled the front and rear of the position, and mud and earth flew. After the enemy blindly bombarded for a long time, the Volunteer Army artillery suffered no casualties and continued to bombard the enemy calmly and accurately. The artillery fire extended into the enemy's rear. The firing hole of a certain gun emplacement was too small to unleash its firepower. Gunners Ji Aiping and Zhang Liangben braved the enemy's dense fire to jump out of the emplacement and enlarge the firing hole, allowing the artillery fire to fully exert its power. An artilleryman was wounded, and ammunition handler Zheng Hanyun immediately volunteered to take his place. Every non-combatant on the position participated in the battle. The fierce artillery battle lasted for forty minutes. The heroic Volunteer Army artillery fought harder and harder, and more and more accurately. The enemy's heavy artillery could not hold out. With the Volunteer Army artillery's extending fire, the enemy's artillery fire became less and less, and finally only sparse long-range artillery fire remained to cover the retreat of their defeated soldiers to the south. At this time, the Volunteer Army artillerymen saw their own infantry rapidly climbing over the mountain peaks to the right to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy, they happily wiped the sweat and mud from their foreheads and continued to advance. Late at night, the gun carriages sped towards the destroyed enemy artillery positions, cooperating with the infantry comrades to bravely pursue the fleeing enemy to the south.

　　American prisoners generally said: "Your artillery shoots accurately! Although we have many cannons, there is no way to suppress the firing of your cannons, which is something that we often feel distressed about." An American prisoner whose leg was broken by a Volunteer Army shell in the battle of Houguli southwest of Hengcheng asked dejectedly: "What kind of cannons are you firing? They are accurate and powerful, and we don't dare to raise our heads even when following behind tanks." The Volunteer Army artillery warriors replied with a smile: "This is the 'Resist America, Aid Korea cannon', which will never be polite to the American invading army." Most of these "Resist America, Aid Korea cannons" are American-made, captured by the Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield. The Volunteer Army's artillery units are becoming more and more powerful. Many artillery squads have replaced their small-caliber cannons with American large-caliber howitzers, and the tools for pulling the cannons have also been replaced with American-made ten-wheeled trucks. These cannons, which Li Qichang called the "lifesavers" of the American invading army, have become effective weapons for the Volunteer Army to kill and wound the enemy.

### 英雄的志愿军炮兵

　　英雄的志愿军炮兵
    新华社前线记者、通讯员集体写作
    中国人民志愿军的炮兵部队在半年多的作战中，有力地支援着志愿军的步兵，予美国侵略军以痛击。炮兵们以自己的勇敢和技术，战胜了数量上占优势的敌人炮兵。
    在各次战役中，志愿军的炮兵都曾发挥了巨大的威力，配合步兵大量地杀伤了敌人。在水原以北帽落山的阻击战中，志愿军炮兵用十六发炮弹把一百多名进犯的敌人打死打伤了七十多个。在很多次战斗中，炮兵们以他们的准确有力的射击，为步兵开辟冲锋道路。在夺取横城以西四○○高地的时候，志愿军某炮兵部队打得敌人躲在被毁的壕沟中不敢抬头。志愿军的步兵们欢呼着：“打得准呀！给我们的大炮记一功！”步兵们借着炮弹爆炸所发出的火光，沿着炮兵开辟出来的道路直奔敌阵，十五分钟就攻占了高地。有时炮兵们也和步兵一样穿插到敌人侧翼去轰击敌人。有一天夜晚，某部炮兵连连长张厉昆和五个战士，将一门炮运动到敌人阵地左翼，出其不意地猛射敌人的汽车停放场，连射八十发炮弹，击毁了敌人的三十多辆汽车。等到敌人仓皇地集中了十多门大炮还击时，勇士们已经胜利地带着自己的炮安返原阵地了。在横城南墨西里战斗中，志愿军某炮兵部队观测员发现在十多里外的山坡上有敌人的炮兵阵地，摆着二十多门榴弹炮。志愿军的炮兵们就迅速将大炮推到有利地形，赶筑工事，接着就准确地向敌炮轰击。敌人慌忙组织炮火还击，炮弹像雨点般射过来，敌机也出动侦察，投弹扫射，可是始终没有打到志愿军的炮兵阵地。激战四小时后，敌人炮火不支，慌忙用汽车把炮拖跑，丢下了三门被毁的大炮和二十多具尸体。
    四月二十二日，在中、朝人民部队的强大反击战中，志愿军某炮兵部队又一次打败了数量上占优势的敌人的炮兵。在发起反击的前一天，炮兵指挥员们已经把当面的敌情和地形观察好了。到晚上，炮兵们就拉着自己心爱的大炮进入了阵地。他们在一夜间构筑了巧妙而坚固的工事，把一门一门的大炮伪装好。第二天，敌人的侦察机不断地在阵地附近上空盘旋侦察，敌炮也盲目地乱打过来。炮兵们又好气又好笑地说：“龟孙子们！等天黑了吃点心吧！”到下午三点半钟，虽然敌机还在上空盘旋，可是炮兵们已经把黑森森的炮口对准敌人了。三点四十分，射击命令下来了。顷刻之间，山谷中迸发出山崩地裂般的声音，一排一排的炮弹直射敌阵。不久以前还很猖狂的敌炮被制压得哑然无声了。不久之后，敌人又重新组织了炮火，进行反击，密集的炮弹落在志愿军炮兵阵地附近。阵地前后硝烟弥漫，泥土飞扬。敌人这样瞎轰了一大阵子，志愿军的炮兵却无一伤亡，依旧沉着准确地轰击敌人。炮火延向敌人纵深了，某炮工事的射击孔太小，发扬不了火力。炮手纪爱平和张良本冒着敌人密集炮火跳出工事，扩大了射击孔，使炮火充分发挥威力。敌人的炮火越来越密，一个炮手负伤了，弹药手郑汉云立即自动出来代理。阵地上的每一个非战斗人员都参加了战斗。激烈的炮战进行了四十分钟。英勇的志愿军炮兵愈打愈猛，愈打愈准。敌人的重炮支持不住了。随着志愿军炮兵的延伸射击，敌人炮火已愈打愈少，最后只剩下稀稀落落的远射程炮火来掩护其败兵南逃。这时候志愿军的炮兵们看到在右侧山峰上自己的步兵正迅速翻越山头向前追歼溃敌，他们愉快地擦擦满头的汗水和泥灰，继续向前推进。深夜，炮车驰向已被摧毁了的敌军炮兵阵地，配合着步兵战友们奋勇南追溃敌。
    美国俘虏们普遍地说：“你们的炮打得准！我们的炮虽然很多，可是没有办法制压你们大炮的发射，这是我们经常感到苦恼的事。”在横城西南后谷里战斗中被志愿军炮弹打断了腿的一个美国俘虏沮丧地问道：“你们打的是什么炮呀？又准又厉害，我们跟在坦克后面也不敢抬头。”志愿军炮兵勇士们笑着回答说：“这是‘抗美援朝炮’，对美国侵略军是决不客气的。”这种“抗美援朝炮”极大部分是美国制的，是志愿军在朝鲜战场上缴获来的。志愿军的炮兵部队正在变得越来越强大了。很多炮兵步队把小口径的炮换上了美国的大口径榴弹炮，拉炮的工具也换上了美国制的十轮卡车。这些被李奇微称之为美国侵略军的“救命恩人”的大炮，已经成了志愿军杀伤敌人的有效武器。
