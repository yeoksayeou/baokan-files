　　Northeast Third Paper Mill Suffered Huge Losses Due to Blind Construction During Capital Construction the Year Before Last

　　[This newspaper reports] In 1949, the state-owned Northeast Third Paper Mill, due to a lack of thorough design for several projects, blindly proceeded with construction during large-scale construction, resulting in significant setbacks. This severely wasted national construction funds and delayed urgent production tasks. The most serious and prominent example is the error in installing the wood digester (a large oval iron tank for cooking raw materials). The wood digester is one of the most important projects in a paper mill. Each wood digester in this mill weighs 120 tons and is 12 meters high, with a total of five. In October 1949, the foundation project for the wood digester of the mill was completed. In April 1950, when the mill designed and built the factory building, it discovered two serious problems: first, the wood digester had already been installed, but the foundation of the wood digester was only 2.65 meters, while it actually needed to be 6 to 7 meters; however, the soil layer at that location was a gravel layer after three meters, which could not be used as a foundation at all; second, it was impossible to build a large factory building for the wood digester on such a gravel layer, because the factory building needed to be 27 meters high (six stories) and required a very solid foundation with strong supports, but the mill had not considered these issues beforehand. As a result, it was necessary to change the factory site and start all over again. Thus, the wood digester, which was hoped to be installed and put into production quickly, is still left there exposed to the sun and rain.

　　There were many examples like the wood digester in the mill's construction project in 1949. Some projects started construction with only a floor plan. Therefore, after construction started, some projects changed their plans, and some projects were reworked. For example, the raw material processing room (regulation room) was originally planned to be two stories, but later, because it was not calculated beforehand that there was a lack of two kinds of equipment, the plan had to be changed after construction started, and two more stories were built. Another example is the raw material storage pool project of the pulping room. Half a month after construction started, it was discovered that the foundation's compressive strength was insufficient, so the foundation was reconstructed, and the bricks that had been laid were taken out.

　　In addition, the problems in the mill's construction are also very serious and should be given attention. For example, some projects accommodated the terrain, so the foundations of some buildings were deep and shallow. After the factory building was built, there were cracks in the walls, which shortened the lifespan of the buildings. During the construction project, there was an accident where a gable wall collapsed. Due to inaccurate calculation of material usage and untimely supply, there were many phenomena of waiting for materials. The mill needed 1,000 tons of rebar for the whole year's construction project, but only 200 tons were available at the start of construction. Sometimes, the progress of the project was affected by waiting for materials. After construction started, some projects used substandard materials because the materials were incomplete. For example, when installing water pipes, the standard was 12-inch pipes, but because there were no 12-inch pipes, 10-inch pipes were used instead, and they will have to be removed and replaced later. This waste is incalculable.

　　Of course, the mill had learned from the lessons of 1949 and made some improvements in the 1950 project, but for the whole country, this lesson still has extremely important significance today.

　　东北第三造纸厂前年进行基本建设时        
    盲目施工造成巨大损失
    【本报讯】国营东北第三造纸厂，在一九四九年大规模的修建中，由于对于若干工程没有周密设计即盲目施工，使工程发生重大的挫折。既严重地浪费了国家建设资金，又延误了急要的生产任务。其中最严重最突出的例子，即是按装木釜（蒸煮原料的椭圆形大铁罐）工程的错误。木釜是造纸厂的最主要工程之一，该厂木釜每个体重一百二十吨，体高十二米，共有五个。一九四九年十月该厂木釜基础工程已经完成，一九五○年四月该厂设计建筑厂房时，才发现了两个严重问题：第一，木釜已经按起来了，但木釜的基础只有二米六十五糎，而实际上要六至七米；但该处地层在三米之后就是砂石层，根本不能作地基；第二，在这样的砂石层上根本不能建筑为木釜用的大厂房，因该厂厂房须高达二十七米（六层），需要很牢固的地基，必须有强有力的支柱，但该厂事先完全没有考虑到这些问题。结果，只有更换厂址，另起炉灶。这样，原来希望很快按装起来生产的木釜，现在仍然放在那里日晒雨淋。
    像木釜这样的例子在一九四九年该厂的建设工程中还有不少，有的工程只画了平面图就开工了。因此，在动工之后，有的工程改变了计划，有的工程返工。如麻处理室（调解室）的工程，原计划建筑两层，以后因为事先没计算到缺乏两种设备，动工后不得不改变计划又建筑两层。又如打浆室的原料储存池的工程，开工半月之后，发现基础耐压力不够，又重新构造基础，并把已砌上的砖都取出来。
    此外，该厂在施工中的问题，也是很严重的，亦应引起警惕。如有的工程迁就了地势，所以有的建筑物的基础有深有浅，在建筑起厂房之后，墙上有裂缝，缩短了建筑物的寿命。在建筑工程中，曾发生了山墙倒塌的事故。由于材料使用计算不准确及供应不及时，等工待料现象很多。该厂全年建筑工程需用铁筋一千吨，开工时仅有二百吨。有时因等材料影响工程的进度。开工后有的工程因材料不齐全，有时就使用不合标准的材料，如按装通水管，标准是十二寸的管子，因为没有十二寸的，就用十寸的来代替，以后还要撤掉重换，这种浪费是无法计算的。
    当然，该厂在一九五○年的工程中已吸取了一九四九年的教训有所改进，但对于全国来说，这个教训，在今天仍有极端重要的意义。
