To the Editor:

　　The Personnel Section of the Telecommunications Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is casually using private connections to co-opt staff from other organizations. We believe this style of work is very bad.

　　Yang Shiheng, an employee of our bureau, was recruited from the Northeast Coal Mine Administration in Hunan in June 1950. His performance at work has consistently been poor. Leading comrades (the Bureau Chief and the Personnel Director of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration) have educated him several times, appropriately adjusted his work assignments, and assigned specific individuals to help him. However, Yang Shiheng still does not seek progress, frequently grumbles, slanders the organization, and sows discord among comrades. He disregards national interests, emphasizes personal interests, and often says that his work does not suit his needs and that his pay is low and life is hard. He does not heed the education from the leadership and even verbally abuses the section chief. He told a comrade who had just graduated from a statistics training class: “The housing you live in is bad, and the General Affairs Section won't resolve it. Go find the Bureau Chief and make a scene. Don’t move in unless they find you good housing.” He incited newly arrived comrades by saying: “The South lacks statistical personnel, and the wages are high. If it’s not good here, you can go back to Guanzhong to find good work.” Some comrades, influenced by him, also wanted to resign. When he found a job in the Telecommunications Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing through private connections and made an unreasonable request to resign, which our bureau did not approve, he made a scene in the Personnel Section and feigned illness to avoid work. After our bureau talked with him several times to understand the situation, it was discovered that the Telecommunications Industry Bureau was using improper means, without going through proper organizational procedures, to co-opt him. The specific facts are as follows: While our bureau was educating this person, the Personnel Section of the Telecommunications Industry Bureau sent him a letter discussing three issues: the nature of the work, the location of the work, and the salary and benefits. They also told him to ask our bureau for organizational certification documents to report to Beijing. This further fueled his arrogance in demanding to leave our bureau. Given this situation, our bureau did not approve his request. Yang Shiheng secretly fled to Beijing on May 10th. After our bureau discovered this, he was dismissed. However, soon after, our bureau received a letter from the Telecommunications Industry Bureau dated May 15th, stating that this person had been employed by their bureau and requesting our bureau to forward his personnel file to their bureau. We believe that the Personnel Section of the Telecommunications Industry Bureau is conducting private co-option without principles, disrupting our work steps. This practice is very wrong, and we hope they will conduct a review.

　　重工业部电信工业局人事科不应通过私人关系拉拢干部编辑同志：
    中央重工业部电信工业局人事科随便通过私人关系，拉拢别的机关的工作人员，我们认为这样的作风是很不好的。
    本局职员阳世恒，是一九五○年六月由东北煤矿管理局在湖南招聘来的，到我局后工作一贯表现不好。领导同志（局长、东北煤矿管理局人事处长）曾几次对他进行教育，并适当地调动了他的工作，还指定了专人帮助他。但阳世恒仍然不求进步，经常在下边发牢骚，谩骂组织，挑拨同志间的关系。他忽视国家利益，处处强调个人利益，常说工作不适合自己的要求，说待遇低、生活苦。他不听从领导上的教育，当面谩骂科长。他和新从统计训练班毕业的某同志说：你们住的房子不好，总务科不给解决，去找局长闹，不给找好房子就不搬家。他挑拨新来的同志说：南方缺少统计人员，工资又高，这里不好可以回关里找好工作。有的同志受他的影响，也要离职。当他自己通过私人关系在北京中央重工业部电信工业局找好了工作，向本局提出无理的辞职要求，而本局不准时，他便来人事科大吵大闹，并装病不上班。后经本局几次谈话了解，才知道是电信工业局用不正当的手段，不通过一定的组织手续，向他进行拉拢的。其具体事实为：本局正向此人进行教育当时，电信工业局人事科曾给他来信，谈到三个问题，即工作性质、工作地点和工资待遇等，并叫他自己向本局要组织证明文件，到北京去报到。这就更助长了他向本局提出离职要求的气焰。本局鉴于这种情况，未能批准他的要求；阳世恒竟于五月十日私行逃去北京。本局发觉后即将其开除。但不久，本局接到电信工业局于五月十五日来信一件，内称此人已被该局采用，要本局将人事档案材料转寄该局。我们认为，电信工业局人事科无原则地进行私人拉拢，扰乱了我们的工作步骤，这种作法是很不对的，希望他们进行检讨。
