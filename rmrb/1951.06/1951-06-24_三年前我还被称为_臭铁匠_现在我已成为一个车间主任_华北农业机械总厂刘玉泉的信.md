Dear Chairman Mao:

The Party's birthday is approaching soon. I think of you every day. The Party liberated me, educated me, and made us workers, who were regarded as worthless by the old society, the masters of today's society. Today I am happy, so happy that I almost want to cry!

Chairman Mao, three years ago I was still called a "stinking blacksmith," treated like a beast of burden. I never imagined that today I would become the director of a workshop in the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory. Since liberation, I have realized that the Party is the party of our working class, and you are like the sun I saw in the darkness. My life is secured, so I actively worked hard to produce iron. In 1949, I was elected as a model worker in our factory. In 1950, I was selected as a model worker in our factory. In 1951, I was again elected as a people's representative of Beijing Municipality from our factory. During this time, I applied to join the Party, and the Party approved my request. Now I have become a formal Party member. I used to be illiterate, but now I can write work summaries and give reports to everyone. Why can I progress and become like this today? I wrote a poem:

	In the past, "stinking blacksmith,"
	People looked down on,
	No matter how hard you hammer the iron,
	From youth to old age, who cares about you?
	If you don't starve to death,
	You still suffer endless hardship.

	Now, a forging worker;
	No, all of us workers,
	Are masters of the new society.
	Work hard for the country,
	Everyone respects, everyone praises.
	Life is guaranteed, culture grows every day.

	Want to know why?
	Because we have Chairman Mao,
	Because we have the Communist Party!

Chairman Mao, I thank the Party, I thank you. I will study hard and actively, overcome difficulties under your leadership, and move forward forever. I want to dedicate my greatest strength to the Party and to the country for the rest of my life. Last year, all the workers in our workshop overfulfilled the production tasks every month. At the end of the year, we forged 25,400 sets of agricultural implements, and our factory supplied farmers with more than 14,000 sets of new agricultural implements. In the first half of this year, our workshop forged 21,800 sets of new agricultural implements, and the entire factory has assembled more than 14,000 sets of new agricultural implements. Our entire factory has a monthly quota of producing 5,000 new-style plows. For the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, and to commemorate the Party's birthday, all the workers in the factory are now fighting for the production of 7,000 new-style plows.

I wish you good health.

	Liu Yuquan, Director of Forging Workshop, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory

### 三年前我还被称为“臭铁匠”  现在我已成为一个车间主任——华北农业机械总厂刘玉泉的信

　　三年前我还被称为“臭铁匠”  现在我已成为一个车间主任
    ——华北农业机械总厂刘玉泉的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的生日快来到了。我无日不在思念着您。党解放了我，教育了我，使我们被旧社会视为一钱不值的工人，当了今天社会的主人。今天我高兴，我高兴得简直要流泪！
    毛主席，我在三年前还被人称作“臭铁匠”，当人的牛马。想不到今天我会成为华北农业机械厂的车间主任。自从解放后，我体会了党是我们工人阶级的党，你像是我在黑夜看到的太阳。我的生活有了保障，我就积极卖力气打铁生产。一九四九年我当选为我厂的劳动模范。一九五○年，我被选为我厂的模范工作者。一九五一年，我又被选为我厂北京市的人民代表。这当中我要求入党，党批准了我的请求，现在我已成为正式党员。我过去一字不识，现在已能写工作总结，还能向大家作报告。为什么我今天能进步，能成这样子？我写了一首诗：
    过去“臭铁匠”，
    人家瞧不起，
    任凭你打铁抡锤用尽力，
    年青到老有谁关心你？
    不是活活饿死，
    就是活着也是受不尽的气。
    现在，锻铁工；
    不，凡是我们工人，
    都是新社会的主人。
    努力生产为国家，
    人人敬，人人夸。
    生活有保障，文化天天长。
    要说为什么？
    就因为有了毛主席，
    就因为有了共产党！
    毛主席，我感谢党，我感谢您，我要努力积极学习，在您的领导下克服困难，永远前进。我要以我终身最大的力量献给党，献给国家。去年我们车间全体职工月月超额完成生产任务，年底，我们锻造了二万五千四百部农具的锻件，我厂供给农民一万四千余部新式农具。今年上半年，我们车间锻造出了二万一千八百部新式农具的锻件，全厂已装配出一万四千余部新式农具。我们全厂每月定额生产五千部新式犁，为了抗美援朝，为了纪念党的生日，全厂职工现在要为七千部新式犁的生产而斗争。祝您身体健康
            华北农业机械总厂锻工间主任  刘玉泉
