　　Northeast Local Currency Redemption Work Completed
　　The work of the Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China to redeem Northeast local currency has been successfully completed. Over the past two months, all Northeast local currency issued by the former Northeast Bank has been recovered, except for a small number of damaged or lost notes.

　　Sino-Polish Shipping Company Established in Tianjin
　　The Sino-Polish Shipping Company was officially established in Tianjin on June 15. The company's main business is to act as an agent for Polish Ocean Lines, Polish Shipping Company, Polish Salvage Company and other ships. It can handle import and export procedures and cargo solicitation for other foreign ships arriving at Chinese and Polish ports. The company is jointly operated by the governments of China and Poland, and will play a huge role in ocean shipping between China, Poland, Asia and Europe. The head office is located in Tianjin, and a branch office is located in Gdynia, Poland. In the future, the company welcomes consignment and agency services for shipping companies operating routes between China, Poland, Asia and Europe, as well as cargo transportation from all parties on these routes.
　　Pingyuan Province Cotton-Grain Price Ratio Changed to Wheat Calculation
　　Regarding the cotton-grain price ratio in Pingyuan Province, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council previously stipulated that one jin of seven-eighths grade lint cotton was equivalent to eight and a half jin of millet. However, wheat is the main grain produced in Pingyuan Province, and the masses are accustomed to using wheat as the calculation standard. In order to better ensure the implementation of the cotton-grain price ratio policy, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has specially revised the cotton-grain price ratio to: one jin of lint cotton is equivalent to eight and a half jin of wheat, in order to meet the requirements of the masses.

　　Dingxiang, Shanxi Adjusts Assessment of Arable Land Yield
　　Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, is adjusting the assessment of arable land yield throughout the county in order to achieve "tax collection according to the rate" during the autumn tax collection. The county had already universally assessed yield once in 1948, and this spring it universally measured all the land in the county, which is generally close to being true and balanced. Now, further adjustments are being made using the gap in agricultural production, which will make the yield assessment more reasonable. The county people's government summoned more than 30 county and district level cadres for training and then dispatched them to key villages for typical investigation.

　　Direct Remittances Between Post Offices in Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Areas Inside Shanhaiguan
　　Remittances between the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and areas inside Shanhaiguan originally had to be transferred through Shanhaiguan, and remitters had to pay a transfer fee. In order to make remittances and withdrawals quick and convenient for the people inside and outside Shanhaiguan, the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued an order to all post offices that, from the date of the order, direct remittances will be implemented between the Northeast and areas inside Shanhaiguan. Direct remittances will be implemented between Inner Mongolia and areas inside Shanhaiguan from July 1. At the same time, the transfer fee will be cancelled. (Post)
