Strictly Prevent Counter-Revolutionary Remnants from Retaliating
　　Yunnan Cracks Multiple Poisoning Cases
    Recently in Yunnan Province, in Mengzi, Kaiyuan, Jianchuan, Ning'er, Yuxi, Wuding, Chengjiang and other places, incidents of counter-revolutionary elements poisoning and killing local residents and cadres have been discovered. In February, counter-revolutionary elements poisoned eight villages in the first district of Mengzi County. Those poisoned suffered from stomach pain, dizziness, and numbness all over. According to the confessions of four counter-revolutionary elements arrested in the county, they numbered more than thirty, disguised as beggars and opium smokers, and went to Kaiyuan, Mengzi and other places in three batches to poison people. From March 5th to 11th, poisoning incidents by counter-revolutionary elements were discovered again in Mengzi, Kaiyuan, Jianchuan and other places, and eight counter-revolutionary elements who committed the poisoning were captured, and some poison was seized. More than ten soldiers from a certain unit stationed in Dongyue Temple in Ning'er County were poisoned. The counter-revolutionary element Luo Hengying, who was arrested in the county, had manufactured thirty-five packets of poison. At a party held by the cadre training class of the CPC Qujing Local Committee, more than thirty people were poisoned when drinking water. Yuxi County arrested six poisoners, including children who had been used by counter-revolutionary elements. The county also discovered a bugler who had been bought by counter-revolutionary elements and conspired to put poison in the water tank of the organ. Counter-revolutionary remnants more viciously used leprosy drugs to poison the people. In the nine poisoning incidents that occurred in the Wuding area, laboratory tests revealed that six of them involved leprosy poison. The above-mentioned incidents were carried out by counter-revolutionary remnants in a planned way. All localities should actively educate the broad masses of people, raise vigilance, and strictly prevent them.
    Editor's Note: In addition to Yunnan, poisoning incidents have also occurred in North China, East China, Northeast China, and Northwest China and other administrative regions. From the confessions of many poisoners, it can be seen that this malicious conspiracy of counter-revolutionary elements is carried out in a planned and organized manner under the unified command of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. All organs and organizations in various places should be highly vigilant against the poisoning conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements. It is also necessary to strengthen education for the broad masses of people and service personnel, pay attention to the inspection of suspicious persons; and add necessary equipment to the water sources commonly used by the people to prevent them from being poisoned by counter-revolutionary elements.

　　严防反革命残余报复
    云南破获放毒案多起
    云南省近在蒙自、开远、建水、宁洱、玉溪、武定、澄江等地先后发现反革命分子放毒杀害当地居民及干部事件。反革命分子二月份里在蒙自县一区八个村放毒。中毒者肚疼、头晕、混身发麻。据该县逮捕的四个放毒的反革命分子供称：他们共有三十余人，化装成乞丐、烟民分三批到开远、蒙自等地放毒。三月五日至十一日，蒙自、开远、建水等地又发现反革命分子放毒事，并捕获了放毒的反革命分子八人，缴获毒药一部。驻宁洱县东岳庙之某部队十余人中毒。该县逮捕的反革命分子罗恒盈，曾制造三十五包毒药。中共曲靖地方委员会干部训练班，在一次晚会上，有三十多人喝水时中毒。玉溪县逮捕了放毒犯六名，其中有被反革命分子利用的小孩。该县并发现一名司号员被反革命分子收买，阴谋在机关水缸里放毒。反革命残余更恶毒地使用麻疯药毒害人民。在武定地区发生的九起放毒事件中，据化验有六起是麻疯毒药。上述事件，是反革命残余有计划地进行的，各地应积极教育广大人民，提高警惕，严加防范。
    编者按：放毒事件，除云南外，在华北、华东、东北、西北等行政区亦发生过。从许多放毒犯的供词中可以看出，这种反革命分子恶毒的阴谋活动，是在美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮统一指挥下，有计划、有组织地进行的。各地机关、团体，应十分警惕反革命分子的放毒阴谋。并须加强对广大人民及勤杂人员的教育，注意对形迹可疑分子的检查；对人民常食用的水源，添置必要的设备，以防受反革命分子的毒害。
