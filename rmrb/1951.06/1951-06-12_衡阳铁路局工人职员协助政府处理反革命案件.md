　　Workers and Staff of Hengyang Railway Bureau
    Assist the Government in Handling Counter-Revolutionary Cases
    Workers and staff of all factories and sections of the Hengyang Railway Bureau are actively assisting the government in handling counter-revolutionary cases. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the railway bureau's workers exposed a number of hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Of the counter-revolutionary elements arrested from various factories and sections in the Wuchang area, more than seven-tenths were exposed by workers. This time, workers organized to assist the government in handling cases, which not only supplemented the criminal materials of the counter-revolutionary elements, making the handling more accurate, but also greatly enhanced the political consciousness of the workers and staff in the process of assisting in the handling.
    The methods used by the workers and staff of the railway bureau to assist the government in handling counter-revolutionary cases are: first, representatives are selected from each trade union group to form a workers' representative meeting. The work of the representative meeting is twofold: first, to conduct propaganda and education on the policies regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to workers and their families, and to collect materials on the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements; second, to review the criminal materials of counter-revolutionary elements and propose preliminary handling opinions. The representative meeting prints brief summaries of the crime materials of the arrested counter-revolutionary elements and distributes them to each trade union group. Each group discusses the handling opinions based on the regulations for the punishment of counter-revolutionaries, and continues to supplement the materials during the discussion. For example, when workers in the Jia Inspection Group of the Hengyang Inspection Section discussed the crimes of a certain counter-revolutionary element, after reading the materials, they focused on a detailed analysis of the crimes committed by the said offender, such as sabotaging locomotives and bridges, and organizing reactionary armed forces, and supplemented some materials regarding the offender's espionage activities in other aspects. Some people suggested: the offender organized special agent armed forces, with three machine guns and dozens of rifles, and was both the mastermind and the commander, and should be sentenced according to Article 5 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries. Some people suggested: the offender sabotaged locomotives and bridges, which is in line with Article 9, Paragraph 1. Finally, the materials were read again, compared with the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, and the circumstances of his resistance to confession were also studied. Everyone said: "He is qualified! There are too many crimes, and he has not confessed since liberation, so he is an object of suppression." Workers in the 13th Group of the Hengyang Inspection Section studied the crimes of six counter-revolutionary elements and, based on the crimes of each counter-revolutionary element, compared them with the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and respectively proposed opinions on the punishments that should be imposed. In the process of discussion, the workers not only deeply understood the spirit of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, but also learned to use legal weapons to deal with counter-revolutionary elements.
    During the workers' discussions, staff representatives participate to understand the situation on the one hand and to inspire and help the group workers conduct discussions on the other. After the discussion, the staff representatives report the workers' opinions and compare and sort them out. Therefore, everyone is clear about whether a certain counter-revolutionary element should be suppressed or leniently treated, how to suppress and how to be lenient. The handling opinions are studied by the workers' representative meeting and passed by all the workers, and then sent to the People's Government for reference when handling these counter-revolutionary criminals.

### 衡阳铁路局工人职员协助政府处理反革命案件

　　衡阳铁路局工人职员        
    协助政府处理反革命案件
    衡阳铁路管理局各厂、段职工积极协助政府处理反革命案件。该路局工人在镇压反革命运动中曾检举出一批潜藏的反革命分子。从武昌地区各厂、段逮捕的反革命分子中，工人检举出来的就占十分之七以上。这次工人组织起来协助政府处理案件，不仅补充了反革命分子的犯罪材料，使处理更加准确，而且职工们在协助处理的过程中，政治觉悟也大大提高了一步。
    该路局职工协助政府处理反革命案件的方法是：首先由各工会小组选出代表，组成职工代表会。代表会的工作，一是向职工和职工家属进行有关镇压反革命政策的宣传教育，并搜集有关反革命分子的罪行材料；一是审查反革命分子犯罪材料，提出初步处理意见。代表会将已逮捕的反革命分子的罪行材料，简要印出交各工会小组。各小组根据惩治反革命条例讨论处理意见，并在讨论时继续补充材料。如衡阳检车段甲检组的工人，在讨论某反革命分子的罪行时，把材料宣读后，就以该犯破坏机车、桥梁，组织反动武装等罪行为重点作了详细分析，并且补充了该犯在其他方面进行特务活动的一些材料。如有的人提出：该犯组织特务武装，有机枪三挺，步枪数十支，又是主谋，又是指挥，应依照惩治反革命条例第五条处刑。有的人提出：该犯破坏机车、桥梁，这种罪行合乎第九条第一款。最后又把材料念了一遍，又和惩治反革命条例对照一下，并且还把他抗拒坦白的情况作了研究。大家说：“够资格啦！罪行太多了，解放后又不坦白，这就是镇压的对象。”衡阳检车段第十三组工人研究了六个反革命分子的罪行，根据每个反革命分子的罪行对照着惩治反革命条例，分别提出应处某刑的意见。工人群众在讨论过程中，不仅深刻领会了惩治反革命条例的精神，而且学会了运用法律武器对付反革命分子。
    在工人讨论时，职工代表分别参加，一方面了解情况，一方面启发与帮助小组工人进行讨论。讨论后，职工代表即汇报工人意见，并加以比较和整理。因此，对某个反革命分子应镇压还是应宽大，如何镇压和如何宽大，大家都清清楚楚。处理意见经过职工代表会研究和工人全体通过后，即送人民政府作处理这些反革命案犯时的参考。
