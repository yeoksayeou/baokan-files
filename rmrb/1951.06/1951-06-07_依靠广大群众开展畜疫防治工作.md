Current Situation and Experiences in Preventing and Controlling Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Various Regions

Since the spring of this year, various livestock diseases have been prevalent in vast areas. Among them, the most widespread and rapidly spreading are rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Rinderpest has occurred in seventy-one counties in ten provinces, including Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. According to incomplete statistics, 8,073 cattle were affected, and 6,452 died. When Shanxi Province prevented and controlled rinderpest, the chairman of the Provincial People's Government and the director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry personally led the work. Some counties did not pay enough attention to this work, and the chairman of the Provincial People's Government promptly criticized and corrected them by telephone. Veterinary personnel, adhering to the principle of "prevention first, treatment second," actively carried out tasks such as blockade, isolation, disinfection, and preventive inoculation. Finally, in two months, they completely eradicated rinderpest in eighteen counties and cities in the province. Hebei Province put forward the slogan "Where rinderpest occurs, eradicate it there," and timely prevention and control also basically eliminated rinderpest in a short period. For example, after rinderpest was discovered in Qicun, the second district of Lincheng County, the county People's Government, while reporting to the higher authorities, took the initiative to strictly block the epidemic area and its surrounding traffic, absolutely prohibiting the movement of both healthy and sick cattle out of the village. A pile of lime was placed outside each household's door to disinfect shoe soles. The heads of each unit personally went to the countryside to lead cotton planting and prevent plague. The county magistrate personally went to the epidemic area to hold mass meetings for propaganda, calling on the masses to strictly prevent the spread of cattle plague. To prevent lawbreakers from spreading rumors and sabotage, public security personnel were stationed in the epidemic villages. Village cadres were also actively responsible, cooperating with the epidemic prevention team to carry out the work. In just thirteen days, preventive injections were completed for all cattle in the first and second districts, preventing the epidemic from spreading and expanding and not delaying spring plowing. Rinderpest is still prevalent in Suiyuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces. Prevention and control are being stepped up.

Foot-and-mouth disease occurred in the Shache district of Xinjiang in May last year. Due to slow intelligence, the epidemic area was not blocked and controlled in time, resulting in the spread of the epidemic to a quarter of the area of ​​the new Xinjiang. In January and February this spring, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Xikang successively suffered from the disease, which quickly spread to 156 counties and banners in Suiyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Rehe, and Southern Jiangsu provinces and regions. According to incomplete statistics, 3,467,935 cattle, sheep, pigs, and camels were infected, and approximately 2,450 livestock died. After receiving instructions from the Central Financial and Economic Commission and the Central Ministry of Agriculture, most provinces took emergency measures and quickly established sub- and branch committees of foot-and-mouth disease prevention and control at all levels to carry out comprehensive prevention and control work. According to incomplete statistics from various places, 1,391 cadres and veterinarians were mobilized to combine blockade, isolation, and disinfection with treatment. Currently, in southern Xinjiang, eastern Qinghai, most of Ningxia, northern Shaanxi, and Guanzhong, the spread of cattle plague has stopped. There are still 21 counties, cities, and banners in the country that have not been eradicated, and prevention and control are now being vigorously carried out.

Judging from the rampant spread and prevention and control of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease this spring, wherever administrative leaders attach importance to it, prevention and control committees or headquarters are established, vigorously publicizing, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, organizing the masses, and timely blocking epidemic areas, isolating sick animals, and conscientiously implementing epidemic prevention measures, such as Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, and Shanghai, the prevention of rinderpest has made significant progress. Wherever this is not done, rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease can spread, causing disaster. (Tang Jianhua)

Suiyuan Province's Animal Epidemic Prevention and Control Work

Suiyuan Province's animal epidemic prevention and control work has been fully launched. From the province to the special districts, counties, and districts at all levels, animal epidemic prevention and control committees have been established. Disease prevention groups have been organized in administrative villages and larger natural villages. Every household with cattle is a member of the disease prevention group. Quarantine stations have been established in traffic arteries and places where livestock and animal products such as fur are collected and distributed, such as Baotou, Gui Sui, and Fengzhen. Various agencies, organizations, and troops have cooperated with the epidemic prevention work. Troops stationed in Wuchuan and Wulan Bulang and the provincial epidemic prevention team organized a joint animal epidemic prevention and control team, divided into five groups, to go to the countryside to help the masses carry out epidemic prevention. The following are the experiences and lessons learned in the epidemic prevention work in Suiyuan Province:

First, the prevention and control of animal epidemics is not just a technical task, but also a mass organizational task. Especially since our veterinary technology is very low and some epidemics do not have effective medicines for prevention and control, we can only overcome difficulties and complete tasks by organizing the masses. This is how Suiyuan Province prevents and controls foot-and-mouth disease: first, after mobilizing and organizing the masses, each village in the epidemic area formed a disease prevention group, formulated covenants for everyone to abide by and supervise each other. After the disease prevention groups were formed in Hongdatu, Baoer Hesha, and Gonghu Dong villages in the fourth district of Wuchuan, they immediately checked the sick cattle from house to house, confined the sick cattle, and did not allow them to go out. It is strictly forbidden to eat grass and drink water in the same trough with other cattle, and it is forbidden to approach any cattle. The hair and bones left after the death of sick cattle were completely removed, burned, or deeply buried. As a result, the foot-and-mouth disease of cattle in these villages was quickly eradicated.

Second, local governments must take responsibility for epidemic prevention. If an animal epidemic occurs, the local government must be responsible for prevention and control first. The epidemic prevention team or personnel sent by the higher-level government are to assist the local work and should accept the leadership of the local government. Only in this way can the enthusiasm and initiative of the local government be fully utilized. Currently, all special districts, counties, and districts in Suiyuan Province have established committees for the prevention and control of animal epidemics. All animal epidemic prevention and control plans and arrangements are the responsibility of the committees at all levels, which jointly bear this task; and through various meetings, they explain the epidemic prevention work, organize the masses and local traditional Chinese veterinarians, and strictly block the epidemic area, collect effective prescriptions, and treat animal diseases. They used a solution of salt and alum to treat foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, which was very effective. They also explained the method of use at mass meetings, and the epidemic prevention personnel demonstrated examples and taught the masses. In this way, a large number of cattle suffering from foot-and-mouth disease were cured.

Third, it is necessary to establish a sound animal epidemic intelligence organization to prevent the spread of the epidemic. After the village disease prevention group is formed, if a cow in someone's family becomes ill, it should quickly report to the group, immediately implement confinement, and report it to the district and county epidemic prevention committees level by level for dispatching personnel to inspect and handle.

Fourth, starting prevention from the source area according to the direction of livestock flow can prevent the spread of the epidemic. According to general rules, livestock often flows from pastoral areas to semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas or pure agricultural areas. If the animal epidemic in the pastoral area cannot be eradicated in time, it can easily be brought to the agricultural area. Therefore, Suiyuan is currently working with the Inner Mongolia epidemic prevention team to conduct widespread rinderpest preventive injections in Maoming'an Banner, Darhan Banner, and Siziwang Banner in Ulanqab League, and is beginning to prevent and control animal epidemics in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　依靠广大群众开展畜疫防治工作
    目前各地牛瘟口蹄疫防治情况及经验
    今年春季以来，各种牲畜疫病在广大地区内流行。其中蔓延最广、流行最速的就是牛瘟和口蹄疫。牛瘟发生于山西、绥远、察哈尔、河北、甘肃、青海、西康、云南、广东、广西等十省的七十一县。据不完全统计，患病牛达八千零七十三头，死亡六千四百五十二头。山西省防治牛瘟时，省人民政府主席和农林厅长都曾亲自领导。有的县份对这一工作不够重视，省人民政府主席就用电话及时地批评纠正。兽医人员在以防为主、以治为辅的原则下，主动积极地进行了封锁、隔离、消毒、预防注射等工作，终于在两个月中将该省十八县、市的牛瘟完全扑灭。河北省提出“牛瘟发生在那里，扑灭在那里”的口号，及时防治，也在短期中基本上消灭了牛瘟，如临城县二区祁村发现牛瘟后。该县人民政府一面报告上级，一面主动地严格地封锁疫区及其周围交通，绝对禁止好坏牛只出院出村。每户门外都设石灰一堆，实行鞋底消毒，各单位首长亲自下乡，一方面领导植棉工作，一方面领导防瘟，县长亲到疫区开群众大会，进行宣传，号召群众严防牛疫蔓延。为防不法分子造谣破坏，并派公安人员驻在疫村。村干部也都积极负责，配合防疫队进行工作。仅十三天工夫，就把一、二区所有牛只全部完成预防注射，使疫势未得蔓延扩大，没有耽误了春耕。绥远、甘肃、青海、西康、云南、广东、广西等省，现仍有牛瘟流行。正加紧防治中。
    口蹄疫于去年五月发生于新疆莎车区。因情报迟缓，未能及时封锁疫区，施行防治，致疫势扩大至全新疆面积的四分之一。今春一、二月份，青海、甘肃、宁夏、陕西、西康相继发生此病，很快地流行到绥远、山西、察哈尔、河北、内蒙古、热河、苏南等省区一百五十六县、旗境内。据不完全统计，有三百四十六万七千九百三十五头牛、羊、猪、骆驼染上疫病，死亡牲畜约二千四百五十多头。各省自接得中央财政经济委员会及中央农业部指示后，大都采取了紧急措施，很快成立了各级口蹄疫防治委员会分、支会，进行全面防治工作。据各地不完全统计，动员干部与兽医一千三百九十一人，以封锁、隔离、消毒配合治疗。目前新疆南部、青海东部、宁夏大部分地区、陕北和关中，牛疫已停止蔓延。全国还有二十一县、市、旗未扑灭，现在正大力防治中。
    以今春牛瘟口蹄疫的猖獗蔓延和防治情况看，凡是行政领导干部重视，成立了防治委员会或指挥部，经过大力宣传，发动群众，依靠群众，组织群众，及时封锁疫区，隔离病畜，认真执行防疫措施的地方，如山西、河北、热河、上海等地，防止牛瘟工作都有显著的成绩。凡是没有这样做的，牛瘟、口蹄疫即得以蔓延，造成灾害。（汤建华）
    绥远省的兽疫防治工作
    绥远省的兽疫防治工作，已经全面展开。由省至专区、县、区各级，都成立了兽疫防治委员会。行政村和较大的自然村，都组织起防疫组。每个有牛户都是防疫组员。在交通要道和牲畜以及皮毛等畜产品集散的地方，如包头、归绥、丰镇等地，都建立了检疫站。各机关团体部队都配合了防疫工作。驻在武川、乌兰不浪的部队和省防疫队，组织了联合兽疫防治队，分成五组，下乡帮助群众进行防疫。绥远省防疫工作中的经验教训有以下几点：
    第一、防治兽疫不只是技术工作，而且是群众性的组织工作。特别是我们的兽医技术很低，有些疫病还没有有效药品可以防治时，只有靠组织群众，才能克服困难，完成任务。绥远省防治口蹄疫是这样作的：首先经过发动和组织群众，疫区内每一个村都组成防疫组，制订公约，大家遵守，互相监督，武川四区的红大都、保尔合沙、公忽洞等村，防疫小组组成后，立即逐户检查病牛，把病牛禁闭起来，不准外出，严禁和其他牛在同一槽里吃草、喝水，不准和任何牛接近。把病牛死后残存的毛、骨完全清除、烧毁或深深掩埋。结果，这几个村的牛口蹄疫很快就扑灭了。
    第二、地方政府要负防疫的责任。如有兽疫发生，首先要由当地政府负责防治。上级政府派来的防疫队或防疫人员，是协助当地工作，应接受当地政府的领导。这样才能充分发挥地方上的积极性和主动性。绥远省目前各专区、县、区都成立了防治兽疫委员会，一切兽疫防治计划和布置，都由各级委员会负责，一致负担起这一任务；并通过各种会议讲解防疫工作，组织群众和当地中兽医，对疫区进行严密封锁，搜集有效验方，治疗畜病。他们采用了食盐、白矾水溶液医治牛口蹄疫，很有成效。并在群众大会上讲解使用方法，由防疫人员作了实例示范，教会了群众。这样治好了大批患口蹄疫的牛。
    第三、要建立健全的兽疫情报组织，制止疫病的蔓延。村防疫小组组成后，谁家的牛发了病，就赶快报告小组，立刻实行禁闭，并及时逐级上报，请区、县防疫委员会派员前往检查处理。
    第四、根据牲畜流动方向，从根源地区着手预防，可以制止疫病蔓延。按一般规律，牲畜多是由畜牧区流向半农半牧区或纯农作区。如果畜牧区的兽疫不能及时扑灭，很容易就带到农业区来。因此，目前绥远正在结合内蒙古防疫队，在乌兰察布盟的茂明安旗、达尔罕旗、四子王旗普遍进行牛瘟预防注射，开始有计划、有步骤地防治兽疫。（赵长城）
