　　How Should Small Units Establish and Implement Patriotic Pacts?
    —Some Issues Seen from Inspecting the Patriotic Pact of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
　　Yu Heng, Peng Lin
    I. Patriotic Pacts Should Be Established Down to the Group Level
    The patriotic pacts of various units of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau were established in April during the popular anti-American and aid-Korea movement. One of the characteristics of the telecommunications bureau employees' patriotic pacts is that they penetrated down to the group level, and each person then made a plan to implement the patriotic pact, with specific and clear goals. As of now, the number of groups in the bureau that have established patriotic pacts accounts for more than 76 percent of the total number of groups in the bureau (some departments, because the production nature of each group is the same, only have department-level patriotic pacts and have not established group-level patriotic pacts). Since the establishment and implementation of the patriotic pacts, great achievements have been made. The work efficiency of each group has generally improved. For example, the Liang Qinghua group, with six people, completed the production tasks of eight and a half people in five days; the line workers of the Fifth Telephone Bureau saved 330 meters of rubber-insulated wire in May. Labor discipline has also been strengthened, and employees generally do not arrive late or leave early. Learning has also been strengthened, and nearly half of the groups have established and improved the newspaper reading system, enabling employees to regularly study current events; many groups that could not hold meetings in the past are now holding them with great enthusiasm.
    Facts have proved that the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's method of establishing patriotic pacts down to the group level is relatively good. At present, there are still many factories in Beijing that only have factory-wide patriotic pacts, and do not have group or workshop patriotic pacts. The employees of these factories feel that the pacts are not specific enough and cannot give each group a clear goal, and therefore do not know how to implement the patriotic pacts. This point is worth noting and correcting by relevant units.
    II. Must Go Through Mass Deliberation and Discussion
    The patriotic pacts of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's groups were proposed by the masses and then signed after deliberation and discussion by the groups. Many employees, after comparing their past and present lives at group current affairs discussion meetings, proposed "to establish a pact as a guideline for their patriotic actions." Before establishing the patriotic pact, the Jia Yunzhang group of the Secretariat went through deliberation and divided into three mutual aid groups within the group according to the nature of their work (typing, receiving and dispatching, storage). The employees of each group separately focused on the characteristics of their work and the main problems to be solved, and proposed a draft patriotic pact. Then the three mutual aid groups discussed together, determined and passed the patriotic pact of the entire group. While the groups were signing patriotic pacts separately, the bureau's Communist Party reporters and propagandists carried out publicity about the patriotic pacts, promoting the discussion and signing of patriotic pacts. Because the patriotic pacts of each group have generally gone through mass deliberation and discussion, most of the masses can consciously implement the patriotic pacts. However, there are also a few groups whose patriotic pacts were drafted in advance by the group leader and passed hastily at the group meeting. The patriotic pacts of such groups have very little effect.
    III. Revise Abstract and Cumbersome Clauses
    The Telecommunications Bureau once inspected the implementation of patriotic pacts in 183 groups and found that 48 groups had significant effects after establishing patriotic pacts; 110 groups played a certain role; and 25 groups' patriotic pacts were reduced to formality. The main reason why the patriotic pacts of these 25 groups were reduced to formality was that the content of the pacts was not appropriate enough. One type was too abstract, shouting empty political slogans. For example, in the Gao Yujie group's pact, only one of the eight clauses was combined with their own business. The other type was too cumbersome, with everything included, incorporating daily life into it, but failing to grasp the main tasks and main problems of a certain period, making it difficult to implement, let alone implement well. After checking out the above deviations, some groups have been supplemented and revised. The implementation effect after the revision is good. For example, one clause in the original pact of the Repair Group was "to abide by the confidentiality system." This clause was too abstract, and it has now been supplemented to "to abide by the confidentiality system, and not lose a single slip of paper." This is now specific and clear, and combined with its own business. In the past, the group's repair slips were constantly lost, but now this shortcoming has been overcome, and the group has achieved the goal of keeping state secrets. In the Wang Xueren group's pact in the Telegraph Office, the item of guaranteeing the overfulfillment of tasks was originally very abstract, but was later revised to: "Guarantee the overfulfillment of tasks, completely eliminate man-made accidents and serious errors, and guarantee that minor errors do not exceed one in 100,000." After revising the pact, the group's production situation has improved significantly. For example, from January to the end of April, the production volume for four months was 900,800 characters, with nine minor errors. In May, the monthly output was 300,4800 characters, with only one minor error.
    IV. Four Inspection Methods
    In order to ensure the implementation of the patriotic pacts, the Telecommunications Bureau adopted four methods of inspecting the patriotic pacts:
    1. A core inspection team is formed, mainly composed of cadres from the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League, and appropriately absorbing group leaders to participate. There are two inspection methods: one is that the cadres of the core inspection team are assigned to be responsible for several groups, "contracting" the inspection; the other is that the inspection team cadres are assigned to be responsible for inspection according to production, work, learning, and other items.
    2. The masses themselves inspect each other anytime, anywhere. The Jia Yunzhang group created an inspection network based on mutual aid groups. The method is: for example, if a mutual aid group has four people, A is responsible for inspecting B and C, B inspects A and D, C inspects D and A, D inspects B and C, and so on. This allows each person to be inspected by two people.
    3. Establish an inspection system for group meetings. Meetings are held once a week, where each person reports on their own implementation of the patriotic pact, and everyone gives each other opinions and conducts inspections.
    4. When Party propagandists and reporters inspect the implementation of patriotic pacts, they carry out propaganda, commend the good, and criticize the bad, in order to urge improvement.
    The results of the Telecommunications Bureau's use of the above four methods for inspection have effectively guaranteed the implementation of the patriotic pacts.

　　各小单位怎样订立和贯彻爱国公约？
    ——从检查北京电信局的爱国公约中看到的几个问题
　　俞衡　鹏林
    一、爱国公约要订到小组
    北京电信局各单位的爱国公约，是在四月份的普及抗美援朝运动中订立的。电信局职工订立爱国公约的特点之一，是深入到了小组，每个人再作出执行爱国公约的计划，有了具体明确的奋斗目标。截至目前为止，全局已订立爱国公约的小组，占全局小组总数的百分之七十六强（有的部门因为各小组的生产性质相同，只有部门的爱国公约，而未订小组的爱国公约）。爱国公约订立、执行以来，已获得很大成绩。各组工作效率已普遍提高。如梁庆华小组，六个人五天完成了八个人半月的生产任务；电话五局的线务工人，五月份节省了三百三十公尺皮线。劳动纪律也加强了，职工普遍作到不迟到不早退。学习也加强了，有将近半数的小组建立与健全了读报制度，使职工得以经常学习时事；许多小组过去开不起会来，现在开得很有劲。
    事实证明，北京电信局这种把爱国公约订到小组的方法是比较好的。目前北京市仍有不少工厂，只订有全厂的爱国公约，而没有订小组的或车间的爱国公约。这些工厂的职工感到公约不具体，不能给每个小组以明确的奋斗目标，因而不知道要怎样去执行爱国公约。这一点是值得有关单位注意补正的。
    二、必须经过群众酝酿讨论
    电信局各小组的爱国公约，是由群众提出，又经小组酝酿讨论后签订的。不少职工在小组的时事讨论会上，对比了今昔生活之后，就提出“要订个公约，作为自己的爱国行动的纲领”。秘书科贾蕴章小组在订立爱国公约以前，经过酝酿，在小组内按工作性质（打字、收发、保管）分成三个互助小组，各组职工分头针对自己工作的特点，和要解决的主要问题，提出爱国公约草案，然后三个互助组共同讨论，确定并通过全组的爱国公约。在各组分头签订爱国公约的同时，局内共产党的报告员、宣传员进行了关于爱国公约的宣传，促进了爱国公约的讨论与签订。正因为各小组的爱国公约，一般都经过了群众的酝酿、讨论，所以大多数群众都能自觉地执行爱国公约。但也有少数小组的爱国公约，是由组长事先拟好条文，在小组会上潦草通过的。这类小组的爱国公约，收效都很小。
    三、修订抽象的和繁琐的条文
    电信局曾检查了一百八十三个小组执行爱国公约的情况，发现订立爱国公约后有显著效果的有四十八个组；起了一定作用的有一百一十个组；爱国公约流于形式的有二十五个组。这二十五个小组的爱国公约所以流于形式，主要原因是公约内容不够恰当。一种是太抽象，空喊政治口号。如高育玠小组的公约，八条中只有一条结合了自己的业务。另一种是太繁琐，色色俱全，把日常生活都订了进去，却未抓住一定时期的主要任务和主要问题，因而很难执行，更难执行得好。经检查出上述偏向后，部分小组已加以补充修订。修订后执行效果良好。如修复小组原公约中有一条是“要遵守保密制度”。这一条太抽象，现已补订为“要遵守保密制度，不丢掉一个条子”。这样就具体、明确了，而且结合了本身业务。过去，该组的派修条子曾不断遗失，现在则克服了这个缺点，做到了保守国家机密。电报处王学仁小组的公约中，原对保证超额完成任务一项订得很抽象，后来改订为：“保证超额完成任务，彻底消灭人为事故和严重差错，保证小差错不超过十万分之一。”修订公约后，该组生产情况有显著改进。如一月到四月底，四个月的生产量是九十万零八千字，出了九个小差错，五月份一个月产量为三十万零四千八百字，只出了一个小错。
    四、四种检查方法
    为了保证爱国公约的贯彻执行，电信局采用了四种检查爱国公约的方法：
    一、以党、行政、工会、青年团的干部为主，适当吸收小组长参加，组成核心检查组进行检查。检查方法有二：一是由核心检查组的干部分工负责几个小组，“包干”检查；一是按生产、工作、学习等项，由检查组干部分工负责检查。
    二、群众自己随时随地互相检查。贾蕴章小组创造了以互助组为单位的检查网，办法是：例如某互助组有四人，由甲负责检查乙、丙，乙检查甲、丁，丙检查丁、甲，丁检查乙、丙，等等。这样可使每人都要受到两个人的检查。
    三、建立小组会议的检查制度。每周召开一次，由各人报告自己执行爱国公约的情况，大家互相提出意见，进行检查。
    四、党的宣传员报告员在检查爱国公约执行情况时，展开宣传，表扬好的，批评不好的，以督促改进。
    电信局采用上述四种办法进行检查的结果，有效地保证了爱国公约的贯彻执行。
