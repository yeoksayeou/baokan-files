　　Organ Therapy and Hypertension
　　Comrades Ge Shaolong and Wang Qian:
    Whether organ therapy is effective and applicable for hypertension is a very important question. I will now provide an explanation based on the information I know.

    Filatov has repeatedly reported on the effectiveness of organ therapy in treating several diseases, but he had not mentioned hypertension before January 1950. In long papers published in the January 1950 issue of "Soviet Medicine" (a publication of the Soviet Ministry of Health) and the July 1949 issue of "Journal of Surgery," he did not state that organ therapy was effective for hypertension.

    Last year, the "All-Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge" invited Filatov to give a long lecture on vision restoration and organ therapy at the Central Auditorium of the association in Moscow. A stenographic record of the lecture was edited and published by the association's publishing department. On page 20 of this booklet, Filatov said: "Organ therapy has had notable success in treating diseases of other tissues of the biological individual, such as lupus vulgaris... bronchial asthma, epilepsy... hypertension."

    This was his first report mentioning the effectiveness of organ therapy for hypertension. Given the authority of Filatov and the "All-Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge," we cannot but consider that organ therapy is related to hypertension. (Editor's note: Filatov's lecture manuscript has been fully translated into Chinese and is included in the upper volume of "The Theory and Application of Organ Therapy" translated and compiled by Ge Shaolong. The few sentences regarding hypertension are on page 26 of that book).

    Secondly, three physicians at the Surgical Research Institute affiliated with the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, the highest medical research institution in the Soviet Union, observed the therapeutic efficacy of organ therapy for various diseases. They reported the results of their observations in the third issue of the "Bulletin of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences" in 1950. Regarding hypertension, they stated: "Twenty-four patients with hypertension received organ therapy. According to the patients' reports during surgery and drainage, most patients felt an improvement in systemic symptoms, with a reduction in headaches and head distension. We are currently still studying and observing these patients." Although this report did not mention whether blood pressure decreased after organ therapy, the improvement in patients' subjective symptoms and the reduction in headaches and head distension seem to indicate that organ therapy is effective for hypertension.

    In addition, I recently met a Soviet expatriate named Ji Qing (C.Ф.Кигин). He told me that he suffered from hypertension and had been injected with medications such as Entodon, but the effect was not very good. Therefore, he wrote to his daughter, Fadeyeva (who lives in Sverdlovsk, Soviet Union, and works as a nurse), asking if there was a good way to treat hypertension in the Soviet Union. A month and a half ago, he received a reply from his daughter saying: "In that city, they are no longer using iodine-based drugs such as Entodon, but are using organ therapy to treat hypertension." This shows that organ therapy can be tried for hypertension.

    Regarding the efficacy of organ therapy for hypertension, I introduced it in the commemorative paper "Filatov's Seventy-Sixth Birthday" (Editor's note: This article was published on page 3 of this newspaper on March 3rd). In Shanghai, the Tongji Hospital affiliated with Tongji University Medical College has applied organ therapy to eleven patients with hypertension, with good results.

    One patient, Gong Qing'an (resident of 706 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai), is currently 53 years old. He had a blood pressure of 186 at the age of 40. On November 7th of last year, he had symptoms of a stroke. His highest blood pressure was 245. Prior to the stroke, twenty injections of Entodon were ineffective. After the dangerous symptoms of the stroke passed, his highest blood pressure remained around 200. He received oxygen injections nineteen times (Soviet method) at Shanghai Tongren Hospital, but his blood pressure did not decrease. However, after being treated with organ therapy 26 days ago, his blood pressure gradually decreased (reaching a low of around 160). Currently, the patient's daily blood pressure is generally around 170, and his limb movements are also freer.

    From the above situations, the relationship between organ therapy and hypertension is noteworthy. Of course, the causes and symptoms of hypertension are very complex, and special attention should be paid when applying organ therapy, otherwise it may cause harmful side effects. We will conduct systematic research on this issue in the future.

### 组织疗法与高血压症

　　组织疗法与高血压症
　　戈绍龙王虔同志：
    组织疗法对于高血压症是否有效，是否可以适用，这是一个很重要的问题。现在就我所知道的一点材料，做一个说明。
    费拉托夫氏对用组织疗法处置有效的若干疾病，曾屡有实验报告，可是他在一九五○年一月以前不曾提及高血压症的问题。他在一九五○年一月号的《苏联医学》（苏联卫生部的刊物）及一九四九年七月号《外科学杂志》里，发表过有关组织疗法的长篇论文，并不曾说组织疗法对高血压症有效。
    去年“全苏联政治知识及科学知识普及协会”邀请费拉托夫在莫斯科该协会的中央大礼堂做了关于眼力恢复及组织疗法的长篇演讲。演讲的速记稿由该会编辑出版部印行。在这本小册子的第二十页上，费拉托夫说：“组织疗法对于生物个体的其他组织的疾病有著名的成功，譬如通常狼疮……枝气管性气喘、癫痫……高血压症。”
    这是他第一次提及组织疗法对高血压症有效的报告。以费拉托夫及“全苏联政治知识及科学知识普及协会”的权威性而言，我们不能不认为组织疗法是对高血压症有关系的。（编者按：费拉托夫的演讲稿，已全部译成中文，载于戈绍龙所译编的“组织疗法的理论与应用”上册内。有关高血压症的几句话，即在该书的第二十六页上）。
    其次，在苏联最高的医学研究机关——苏联医学研究院附属外科研究所中，有三位医师做过组织疗法对各种疾病治疗效力的观察。他们在一九五○年第三期的“苏联医学院通报”里报告了观察的结果。其中关于高血压的问题，他们是这样说的：“高血压症病人二十四名受了组织疗法的处置。根据手术抽线时病人的报告，多数的病人自觉全身症状改善，头痛及头胀减轻。对这些病人，我们目下还在研究和观察中。”这个报告，虽然不曾提及在施行组织疗法后血压是否降低，但病人自觉症状的改善和头痛头胀的减轻，似乎是组织疗法对高血压症有效的现象。
    此外，我在最近曾遇见一个苏联侨民吉庆氏（Ｃ·Ф．Ｋигин）。他告诉我，他患着高血压症，曾注射恩托东（Ｅntodon）之类的药品，但效力并不很好。因此，他写信给她的女儿法捷也娃（她住在苏联斯威尔洛夫斯克市，担任护士工作），问在苏联有无医治高血压症的好办法。一个半月前，他接到了他的女儿的回信，说：“在该市现在不用碘剂制的恩托东之类的药品，而用组织疗法治疗高血压症。”由此可见，组织疗法对于高血压症是可以试用的。
    关于组织疗法对高血压症的效力，我曾在“费拉托夫七十六岁诞辰”的纪念论文（编者按：该文发表在三月三日本报三版）中介绍过。在上海方面，同济大学医学院附属同济医院曾应用组织疗法于十一名高血压症病人，成绩尚好。
    有一名病人龚庆安（住上海市威海卫路七○六号），现年五十三岁。他四十岁时血压一百八十六。去年十一月七日曾有过中风的症候。最高血压为二百四十五。中风前注射二十针恩托东无效。中风危险症状过去后，最高血压仍在二百左右。他在上海同仁医院用氧注射十九次（苏联方法），血压也不降低。但在二十六天前，经用组织疗法治疗后，血压逐渐降低（最低时为一百六十左右）。现在该病人每天的血压大抵是一百七十左右，手脚的运动也较自由了。
    从上述种种情况看来，组织疗法对高血压症的关系是值得注意的。当然，高血压症的原因和症候很为复杂，应用组织疗法时就需要特别注意，否则会引起有害的副作用。对这个问题，我们今后还要做系统的研究。
