    I Used to Be a Timid Female Worker, But the Party Cultivated Me into a Resolute Cadre
    The 30th anniversary of the Party is fast approaching. How excited all the Chinese people are on this great anniversary!

    Over the past thirty years, the Party has liberated the Chinese people from deep waters and heavy oppression. The working class, in particular, is respected everywhere. Speaking for myself, from being a very weak female worker in the past, I have gloriously joined the Party under the Party's nurturing, cultivation, and education for two years, and now I am a cadre of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions. I have been thoroughly liberated politically and culturally, and my life has also been improved.

    Before liberation, I was an ignorant garment factory worker who only knew how to work desperately to support my family. I had never even heard of politics; when I suffered, I could only blame my bad luck.

    After liberation, I participated in study classes and initially understood who was to blame for the past suffering. If the working people want to live a good life, they must make revolution. I also went to the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's cadre training class, gained a further understanding of the Party, and established a revolutionary outlook on life. Soon after returning to the factory, I was elected chairman of the trade union. At that time, I was really surprised and scared. I felt that I had no experience or methods at all, so how could I do leadership work? I only knew how to worry all day long and had no confidence in my work. The Party branch secretary and others knew about this situation and helped and encouraged me concretely at any time. They told me: "Work ability comes from practice. As long as you are willing to work hard, you will do well." When I had shortcomings, they corrected them at any time; they told me how to go deep into the masses to do my work. In this way, under the constant guidance of the Party, my work ability and confidence were constantly improved.

    Later, after the merger of the Third Factory and the First Factory, I felt that the burden was even heavier. In a factory with more than 800 male and female workers, the original chairman of the First Factory's trade union was transferred to study again. I really didn't know how to start. When I had difficulties in my work, I didn't know how to consult with the masses more, and I didn't promote organizational power to do it. I just ran around by myself and was busy all day long. The trade union work could not be promoted, and I was always behind the production upsurge of the masses. I couldn't promote the experienced methods in time, and I couldn't summarize the lessons from the bad ones. The masses had opinions, and I didn't have confidence in myself and didn't believe that I could do my work well. The Party promptly reminded me not to forget that I was a Communist Party member, to have the spirit of overcoming great difficulties to do my work, and to learn from the heroic struggle spirit of the revolutionary martyrs. I received the education and encouragement of the Party, summarized the shortcomings of my work, and clearly realized that I could only do my work well if I gave full play to everyone's wisdom and strength. After the organization was rectified, it became active. The workshop committee members were able to take the initiative to lead the masses in discussing production and formulating plans, and there was no longer the phenomenon of running to every group and not doing well in any of them. Especially last winter, the tasks were particularly heavy, the designs were complicated, and the time was tight. Sometimes, after receiving a batch of tasks, the leading cadres had no confidence in completing them on schedule. However, after the plan was discussed by the masses, everyone realized the importance of the task, the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and they completely overcame various difficulties and ensured the completion of the task. Various tasks have also caught up with the requirements, such as propaganda and mobilization work, which can not only praise everyone's achievements at any time and promote experience, but also combine the lectures on current events and cartoons, so that everyone can receive the education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea anytime and anywhere, and everyone's political consciousness can also be gradually improved. This great education made me deeply experience Chairman Mao's teaching: believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and consult with everyone when something happens, so that you can do your work well.

    In the past two years, if there had been no constant cultivation and education from the Party, wouldn't I still be the same as before? I deeply feel that the Party is even more lovable than my own mother. My mother only raised me, but the Party turned me from timid to resolute, from ignorant to able to do work and serve the masses. I understand: today's achievements are given by the Party. I must always contribute my greatest strength under the leadership of the Party, improve my work and study, do a good job in mass work in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and fulfill the tasks given by the Party for defending and building the motherland.

    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

### 从前我是一个怯弱的女工  党把我培养成刚强的干部

    从前我是一个怯弱的女工  党把我培养成刚强的干部
    党三十周年的纪念日即将到来了。逢上这个伟大的纪念日，全中国人民是多么兴奋啊！
    三十年来，党把中国人民从水深火热重重压迫下解放出来。特别是工人阶级，到处受到尊敬。就我自己来讲，从过去一个很懦弱的女工，二年来在党的抚育、培养、教育下，光荣地参加了党，现在作了北京市总工会的干部。在政治上、文化上，都彻底地翻身了，生活上也得到了改善。
    解放前，我是一个什么都不懂的被服厂工人，每天只知为了全家的生活，拼命地工作着。对于政治，根本就没听说过；受苦受罪就只有怨自己命苦。
    解放后，我参加了学习班，初步了解到过去的苦是谁给的。劳动人民要想过好日子，就得革命。又到北京市委干部训练班学习，对党有了进一步的认识，树立起了革命的人生观。回厂后不久，就当选为工会主席。当时真是又惊又怕，觉得自己一点经验办法都没有，怎能作领导工作呢？一天只知着急，对工作没信心。党支部书记等知道这种情形，就随时具体帮助我，鼓励我。他们告诉我：“工作能力是从锻炼中来的。只要肯努力工作，就会作好的。”有了缺点，就随时给纠正；告诉我怎样深入到群众中去作工作。就这样，在党时刻指导下，使我的工作能力和信心不断的提高。
    后来三厂和一厂合并后，我感觉担子更重了。八百多男女工人合在一起的工厂，原来一厂的工会主席又被调去学习了，真是不知如何下手。工作有了困难，也不知多和群众商量，推动组织力量去作，只是自己一人东跑西跑，一天忙到晚，工会工作推动不下去，处处都走在群众生产热潮后面。有经验不能随时推广，坏的也不能总结教训。群众有意见，自己也没信心，不相信自己能把工作作好。党及时地注意提醒我不要忘记自己是一个共产党员，要有克服巨大的困难精神去作工作，要学习革命先烈们的英勇斗争的精神。我得到了党的教育和鼓励，把工作毛病总结出来，明确认识了要发挥每个人的智慧力量才能作好工作。把组织整顿后，都活跃起来了。车间委员能够主动地领导群众讨论生产，订计划，再也没有每个小组都去跑，结果那个也没作好的现象了。尤其去年冬天任务特别加重，样子复杂，时间要的又紧。有时接到一批任务后，领导干部都没信心能按期完成。但是把计划通过群众讨论后，大家认识到任务的重要性，群众情绪高涨，完全克服了各种困难，保证完成了任务。各种工作也都赶上了要求，如宣传鼓动工作，不但能把大家的成绩随时表扬，推广经验，还能结合讲时事、画漫画，使大家随时随地受到抗美援朝的教育，使大家的政治觉悟也能逐渐的提高。这一个大的教育，使我深深地体验到了毛主席的教导：相信群众，依靠群众，有事和大家商量，才能把工作作好。
    二年来，如果没有党的时刻的培养教育，我还不是和从前一样吗？我深刻地体验到党比我自己的妈妈还可爱。妈妈只是把我抚养大，而党把我从怯弱变成刚强，从什么都不懂变成了会做工作，能为群众服务。我明白：今天的成就是党给的，我一定永远的在党的领导下，贡献出自己最大的力量，把工作、学习提高一步，在抗美援朝运动中把群众工作作好，为保卫祖国、建设祖国，完成党给予的任务。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
