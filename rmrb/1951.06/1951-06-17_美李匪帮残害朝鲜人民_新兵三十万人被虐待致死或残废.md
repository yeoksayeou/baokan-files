　　The American-Li Gang Cruelly Torture the Korean People
　　300,000 New Recruits Abused to Death or Crippled
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] Another shocking incident of the American-Li gang cruelly torturing the Korean people has been exposed due to internal attacks within the Li Seung-man gang. An Associated Press report from Busan on the 12th stated that Su Minghe (transliteration), chairman of the Security Committee of the pseudo “National Assembly,” revealed while attacking the pseudo “National Guard Corps” that since last December, more than 50,000 South Korean new recruits have died in military training camps due to hunger and “inhumane treatment.” Su Minghe estimated that approximately 250,000 people have become permanently disabled due to the harsh treatment in the military training camps. Su Minghe also said that the committee has confirmed that new recruits were forced to undertake a 300-mile “death march” last December. The American-Li gang drove "700,000 soldiers in thin clothing" to the south. These forcibly conscripted new recruits "had nothing to eat and wrapped themselves in rags and straw." As a result, there were numerous deaths.

    新兵三十万人被虐待致死或残废
    【新华社十六日讯】又一件美、李匪帮残害朝鲜人民的骇人听闻事件，因李承晚匪帮内部互相攻击而暴露出来。合众社釜山十二日消息报道伪“国民议会”安全委员会主席苏明河（译音）在攻击伪“国民警卫团”时透露：自从去年十二月以来，有五万多名南朝鲜新兵在军事训练营中因饥饿及“非人道的待遇”而死亡。苏明河估计，由于军事训练营中的恶劣待遇，约有二十五万人已成终身残废。苏明河并说，委员会已证实，新兵在去年十二月被迫作三百英里的“死亡进军”。美、李匪帮把“衣着单薄的七十万士兵”驱向南方。这些被强征来的新兵“没有吃的，以破布及稻草缠在身上”。结果，有大量死亡。
