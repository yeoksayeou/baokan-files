　　First Anniversary of Korean War Against America
　　Chairman of the China Peace Committee  Guo Moruo
　　Amidst the great victories of the Chinese and Korean people, we greet June 25th – the first anniversary of the Korean people's launch of the righteous war against America. We extend our warm respects to the Korean people, to the Korean People's Army, and to General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people.
　　The Korean people have achieved brilliant successes in the righteous war against America. In terms of military victories alone, although there have been some twists and turns in the past year, the ambition of American imperialism to annex Korea has been completely shattered. According to recent statistics, since the Chinese People's Volunteers joined the battle on October 25, 1950, up to June 10 of this year, the enemy has been annihilated 222,302 on the Korean battlefield, including 104,873 American soldiers.
　　Such heavy casualties are a heavy blow to the American bandits. When American imperialism launched the war a year ago, it had a total of twelve divisions, numbering 234,000. Seven divisions and one Marine Corps regiment participated in the Korean War, totaling 139,400. After several replenishments, the division and regiment numbers remained the same, but the personnel have already been replaced with new recruits. As early as October 6 last year, the U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall said, "To replenish the vacancies on the Korean front, the domestic land forces must be completely transferred." On January 19 this year, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins said, "Even the complete transfer is not enough, and the reserves must be mobilized." Based on these, we can conclude how the mobilization plan of American imperialism has suffered setbacks in the war of aggression against Korea.
　　American imperialism initially estimated that Korea would be easily taken. First of all, it overestimated the strength of the puppet Li Seung-man, just as it overestimated the strength of the puppet Chiang Kai-shek in China. It was convinced that the puppet army it had equipped could win the battle, but this was a miscalculation from the start. Secondly, it underestimated the strength of the Korean people, just as it underestimated the strength of the Chinese people when it supported Chiang Kai-shek in launching the counter-revolutionary civil war in China. This was also a complete miscalculation. Furthermore, it estimated that we, the Chinese people, would stand by and watch, allowing it to easily swallow Korea and then stir up trouble for us one by one. It thought we were such a selfish nation, and that our strength was insufficient, unable to take care of ourselves and even less able to care for our neighbors. Needless to say, this estimate was also completely wrong. Under various wrong estimates, the war gamble conducted by the American bandits has already been lost today. The American bandits are the number one imperialist power in the world today. They are accustomed to self-intoxication and to making empty threats. They always think they are amazing, the best in the world, and some pro-American, flattering, and fearful people also think the United States is amazing, the best in the world. But what is it like today? It has suffered such a great defeat in this local war in Korea! Self-intoxication has turned to eating dung, empty threats are ineffective, and the paper tiger has been exposed. The American bandits are arguing among themselves internally, and there are disagreements within the aggressive bloc. Pro-American, flattering, and fearful people may not say it, but they understand in their hearts. The backer of American imperialism is unreliable, and the number one power of American imperialism is not to be feared. The prestige is at stake, how can the American bandits not panic!
　　The American bandits and the aggressive bloc are suffering blows, and the forces of the democratic camp opposing the war of aggression and defending world peace are being encouraged. The victory of the Korean people is not only a common victory for the people of China and Korea, but also a common victory for the people of the world. Today, not only are the backward ideas of being pro-American, flattering, and fearful of America being liquidated on a global scale, but also, conversely, the progressive ideas of despising, scorning, and hating American imperialism are being fully developed on a global scale. Military power plus moral power forces American imperialism to re-evaluate the prospects of its war gamble. Since the war instigator Truman dismissed another war instigator MacArthur on April 11, the American bandits have been fighting like dogs internally, arguing endlessly, but one thing is clear. Whether it is Truman or MacArthur, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, they have to admit that their war gamble has no future, and they have to admit that they do not have the ability or the courage to expand the war today. This is beneficial to the cause of defending world peace. What the enemy cannot do today, we must make sure it cannot do tomorrow. What the enemy dares not do today, we must make sure it dares not do tomorrow. The Third World War can thus be prevented, and the lasting peace of the world can be finally guaranteed.
　　Of course, the enemy will not be reconciled. Although the enemy understands that it cannot fight a major war today, it dreams that it may be able to fight a major war tomorrow. A robber does not want to stop, if a robber stops, then it is not a robber. Imperialism is a kind of aggressive institution, if imperialism does not engage in aggression, then it is not imperialism. Therefore, although American imperialism has suffered blows today, it has not completely awakened, it is still dreaming. It thinks it has money, and with money it can fight wars. If it cannot fight itself, it can spend money to find people to fight. Therefore, it is desperately increasing its military budget, increasing its military production, and stepping up its collusion with the Nazi remnants in Western Germany and the militarist remnants in Japan, wanting to further rearm West Germany and Japan as cannon fodder for launching a world war. Hitler is dead, Mussolini is dead, Tojo Hideki is dead, how many years has it been? And Truman, Churchill and the like are about to jump off a cliff with their eyes open. Chiang Kai-shek has failed, Li Seung-man has failed, these ugly guys are going to be唾骂 for hundreds of millions of years, but Yoshida Shigeru, Adenauer and the like want to be the third and fourth Chiang Kai-shek. Things that should decline are declining at an accelerated rate, and our task is to further accelerate its speed and promote its decline.
　　The victory of the people of China and Korea is a great contribution to world peace. Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the Korean people's war against America, the most important thing is to consolidate our victory, expand our victory, so that we can make a greater contribution to the defense of world peace. How should we work hard? As far as we Chinese people are concerned, we must continue to popularize and deepen our movement to resist America and aid Korea, especially to step up the response to the recent three major calls of the China Peace Committee: universally establish and earnestly implement patriotic conventions, donate aircraft and artillery, and offer condolences to the families of martyrs and soldiers. At the same time, we must resolutely support the resolutions of the World Peace Council: demand that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty, and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of West Germany and Japan. In this way, we can strive for the comprehensive victory of the Korean War to come quickly, strive for the widespread foundation of the democratic peace camp to expand even more, so that the declining - American imperialism and its group of lackeys, will accelerate their decline.
　　The Korean people have suffered unprecedented and brutal disasters in the righteous war against America, and we feel boundless anger. This anger is also a kind of strength for us, we must thoroughly, cleanly, and comprehensively eliminate the enemy! The phoenix is reborn from the fire, and after the enemy is eliminated, the heroic and unyielding Korean people will create a more glorious and splendid Korea on the basis of glorious victory. We, the Chinese people, will not only help Korea in the war against America today, but will also help Korea in its construction tomorrow. No matter how great the disaster, it cannot stop us. Hand in hand, fighting bravely and advancing for the sake of defending the security of our motherland and for the sake of defending world peace!
　　Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed in the righteous war against America!
　　Long live the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Korea, cemented with blood!
　　Long live the final victory of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union!
　　June 24

### 朝鲜抗美一周年

　　朝鲜抗美一周年
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席  郭沫若
    在中朝人民伟大的胜利中，迎接六月二十五日——朝鲜人民发动抗美正义战争的一周年。我们热诚地向朝鲜人民致敬，向朝鲜人民军致敬，向朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军致敬。
    朝鲜人民在抗美正义战争中，是有着辉煌的成就的。单就军事上的胜利来说，这一年之中虽然有些曲折，但基本上是把美帝国主义企图吞灭朝鲜的野心完全粉碎了。据最近的统计，仅自中国人民志愿军参加作战以来，即自一九五○年十月二十五日起，截至本年六月十日止，七个半月中敌人在朝鲜战场上已被歼灭了二十二万二千三百零二人，其中美军占十万四千八百七十三人。
    如此惨重的伤亡，这在美寇是一个沉重的打击。美帝国主义在一年前发动战争时，总共只有十二师人，人数是二十三万四千。有七个师一个陆战队团参加了朝鲜战争，是十三万九千四百人。经过几次补充，师团的番号没有变，但人员呢已经是“长江后浪推前浪”了。去年十月六日美寇国防部长马歇尔早就说过：“要补足朝鲜前线的缺额，须把国内的陆上部队调光”。今年一月十九日美寇的陆军参谋总长柯林斯更说：“调光都还不够，还须得动员后备队”。根据这些，我们可以断定美帝国主义的动员计划，在侵略朝鲜战争中，是怎样遭受着挫折了。
    美帝国主义最初的估计，以为朝鲜是很容易拿下的。首先它是过高估计了傀儡李匪承晚的力量，也就和在中国它过高估计了傀儡蒋匪介石的力量一样，它满以为它一手装备起来的傀儡军是可以打胜仗的，然而这首先就估计错了。其次它是过低估计了朝鲜人民的力量，也就和它在中国支持蒋匪介石发动反革命内战时过低估计了中国人民力量一样，这也完全估计错了。再次，它是估计我们中国人民会作壁上观，让它轻轻便便地把朝鲜吞下去，再来挨次地搅我们。它认为我们是那样自私自利的民族，而且我们的力量不够，自顾不暇，还顾不到邻人。不用说它这个估计也完全错了。在种种错误的估计之下，美寇所进行的战争赌博，在今天说来，已经是输了。美寇是今天天字第一号的帝国主义强国，它自己惯爱自我陶醉，也惯爱虚声恫骇，自己总以为自己了不起，是世界第一，一些亲美、媚美、恐美的人也以为美国了不起，是世界第一。但今天怎样呢？在朝鲜这个局部性的战争中也遭受到了这样大的惨败！自我陶醉吃粪了，虚声恫骇不灵了，纸老虎被戳穿了。美寇内部自己在吵闹，侵略集团内部也意见纷歧了，亲美、媚美、恐美的人们尽管嘴里不说，心里总是明白的。美帝国主义这个靠山并不可靠，美帝国主义这个天字第一号的强国并不足怕。威望所系，这叫美寇怎么能不发慌！
    美寇和侵略集团受着打击，反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的民主阵营的力量也就受着鼓舞。朝鲜人民的胜利，不仅是中朝两国人民的共同胜利，而且是全世界人民的共同胜利。在今天不仅亲美、媚美、恐美的落后观念在世界范围内遭受着清算，反过来，对于美帝国主义鄙视、蔑视、敌视的进步观念也在世界范围内全面展开了。军事上的威力更加上道义上的威力，这就逼得美帝国主义对于战争赌博的前途不能不作重新的估计。自从四月十一日战争祸首杜鲁门把另一战争祸首麦克阿瑟免职以来，美寇内部一直都在狗咬狗，争吵不休，但有一点是明白的。无论杜鲁门也好，麦克阿瑟也好，民主党也好，共和党也好，他们不得不承认他们的战争赌博没有前途，他们不得不承认他们今天没有本领而且也没有胆量来扩大战争。这对于保卫世界和平事业是有利的。敌人今天不能，我们要使得它明天也不能。敌人今天不敢，我们要使得它明天也不敢。第三次世界大战这样就可以防祸于未然，全世界的持久和平也就可以得到最后的保障了。
    当然敌人是不会甘心的。敌人虽然明白了它今天不能大打，但它在梦想着明天或许能大打。强盗还不想收手，强盗如收手，那就不是强盗了。帝国主义就是一种侵略机构，帝国主义如不从事侵略，那就不是帝国主义了。所以美帝国主义在今天虽然遭受到打击，但它并没有彻底觉悟，它还在做梦。它以为有的是钱，有钱就可以打仗。自己不能打，可以出钱去找人来打。因此，它在拚命的增加军事预算，增加军需生产，加紧和西部德国的纳粹残余分子、日本的军国主义残余分子勾结，想更进一步重新武装西德和日本，作为它发动世界战争的炮灰。希特勒死了，墨索里尼死了，东条英机死了，才几年呢？而杜鲁门、邱吉尔之流又要睁着眼睛跳岩。蒋介石失败了，李承晚失败了，这些丑恶的家伙是要受着亿万世的唾骂的，然而吉田茂、阿登纳之流，又想作蒋介石第三、第四。应该没落的东西在加速度地没落，我们的任务呢，就在更进一步地加快它的速度、促进它的没落了。
    中朝两国人民的胜利对于世界和平是有很大的贡献的。我们今天庆贺朝鲜人民抗美战争的一周年，最要紧的就是要巩固我们的胜利、扩大我们的胜利，使我们对于世界和平的保卫能有更大的贡献。我们该怎么努力呢？就我们中国人民来说，我们要继续普及深入我们的抗美援朝运动，特别是加紧响应抗美援朝总会最近的三大号召：普遍订立并切实执行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮，慰劳烈属军属。同时我们要坚决拥护世界和平理事会的决议：要求五大国缔结和平公约，反对美帝国主义重新武装西德和日本。这样便可以争取到朝鲜战争的全面胜利的迅速到来，争取到民主和平阵营的广泛基础的愈见扩大，使没落者——美帝国主义和它的走狗集团，愈见加速度地走向没落。
    朝鲜人民在抗美正义战争中遭受到史无先例的残酷的灾难，我们是感受着无比的愤怒的。这愤怒也就是我们的一种力量，我们一定要彻底地、干净地、全面地把敌人消灭！凤凰是从火中再生的，把敌人消灭了，英勇不屈的朝鲜人民会在光荣的胜利基础之上，创造出更加光辉灿烂的朝鲜。我们中国人民，不仅在今天帮助朝鲜抗战，明天更会帮助朝鲜建设。怎样天大的灾难也阻挠不了我们。我们手携着手，为了保卫祖国的安全，为了保卫世界的和平，英勇地战斗着前进！
    在抗美正义战争中牺牲了的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民用血凝结成的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营最后胜利万岁！
        六月二十四日
