　　Economic Life Dynamics
            Xinjiang Farmers and Herdsmen Association Preparatory Committee Established
    The first Xinjiang Provincial Farmers and Herdsmen Representative Conference was held in Dihua from May 13th to 16th. A total of 128 farmer and herdsmen representatives attended the meeting. The meeting elected Zhang Bangying (Third Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Communist Party), Mu Shaqun, Zi Ban, Mu Saka Wa and other 37 people as members of the preparatory committee for the province's farmers and herdsmen association, and established the Xinjiang Provincial Farmers and Herdsmen Association Preparatory Committee. The meeting unanimously supported the resolution of the province's first People's Representative Conference on implementing rent reduction in rural areas throughout the province after the autumn harvest this year, and resolved to rapidly establish farmers and herdsmen associations in Xinjiang Province in order to unite and lead farmers of all ethnic groups throughout the province to strive for the realization of rent reduction.
            Southwest Farmers Widely Build Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects
    Since the beginning of spring in the Southwest region, farmers in various places, while carrying out the movements of rent reduction, anti-local tyrant, and land reform, have been widely building small-scale water conservancy projects in order to strive to restore and increase the irrigated area by one million mu this year. Before and after the Spring Festival, local people's governments convened water conservancy meetings in various places and led local farmers' associations to discuss detailed plans for building water conservancy projects. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government also allocated more than 10 billion yuan in small-scale water conservancy loans to the Southwest region to solve the problem of the lack of funds for water conservancy construction for the vast number of farmers. After receiving these assistance from the people's government, the farmers' enthusiasm was very high. Many farmers, after seizing water conservancy rights from landlords and local tyrants, voluntarily used the fruits of rent reduction to build water conservancy projects.
            South China Enterprise Company's Business Developing Rapidly
    Since the establishment of the Guangzhou Municipal Joint Public-Private South China Enterprise Co., Ltd., its business has developed rapidly. The company was established in mid-February with a total share capital of 50 billion yuan, to be raised in three phases. Currently, more than 10 billion yuan has been raised. Public shares account for 30 percent of the company's total share capital, directly invested by the Guangdong Provincial People's Government. Most of the private shareholders are overseas Chinese from all over the world and business people from Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, Fujian and other places. In the past three months, the company has cooperated with Guangdong's state-owned trading institutions to purchase and sell local products with a cumulative capital of 15 billion yuan. At the end of April, the company had a net profit of more than 620 million yuan. In order to further expand the scope of business operations, the company will add trust, public utilities, warehousing, transportation and other departments in addition to the existing trade, industry and investment departments.
            Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and Other Units Sign Collective Labor Insurance Contracts
    The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the administrative and trade union sides of 25 state-owned and joint public-private trading departments such as the Tianjin Municipal Department Store, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and Native Produce Company, in accordance with Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations of the National Labor Insurance Regulations, have successively signed collective labor insurance contracts after consultation.
    The draft collective labor insurance contract of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission stipulates that it will be implemented with emphasis in various repair and prevention sections (including engineering teams), engineering teams directly under various bureaus, the Yellow River Diversion Project Office, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's directly affiliated mechanical engineering teams, various surveying teams, various precision leveling teams, and the Northwest Water and Soil Conservation Experiment Station and Gully Management Experiment Station. The collective labor insurance contracts of 25 trading departments such as the Tianjin Department Store stipulate that all labor insurance costs shall be paid directly by the administration, and the administration shall not pay additional labor insurance premiums.
            Stable Prices in Inner Mongolia After Currency Unification; Renminbi Welcomed by People of All Strata
    After the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the order to unify the currency system, people of all strata in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region warmly supported it, and the work of banks in various places to collect Mongolian currency proceeded smoothly. By the end of April, according to incomplete statistics, more than 75 percent of the Inner Mongolian currency issued had been recovered. Ninety percent of the currency circulating in the market is Renminbi. Prices are stable, and the Renminbi has a high reputation among the masses. For example, workers in Ulanhot reflected: "The currency system has never been unified in these years. Only the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can complete this great historical task. The unification of the national currency is beneficial to the exchange of materials inside and outside the customs and the economic prosperity of Inner Mongolia." Peasants in Tongliao said: "In the past, every time the Kuomintang changed paper money, prices rose many times. The rich became richer, and the peasants always suffered. This time the currency system is unified, and prices are so stable, only the Communist Party and the People's Government can do it."

            新疆农牧民协会筹委会成立
    新疆省第一次全省农民、牧民代表会议，已于五月十三日到十六日在迪化举行。到会的农民代表和牧民代表共一百二十八人。会议选举张邦英（中共新疆分局第三书记）、木沙群、孜伴、木沙卡瓦等三十七人为该省农民、牧民协会的筹备委员，成立了新疆省农牧民协会筹备委员会。会议一致拥护该省首届人民代表会关于今年秋后在全省农村实行减租的决议，并决议迅速建立新疆省的农牧民协会，以便团结和领导全省各族农民，为实现减租而奋斗。
            西南农民普遍兴修小型水利
    西南区入春以来，各地农民在开展减租、反恶霸及土地改革运动的同时，普遍兴修小型的水利工程，以争取在今年恢复和增加灌田面积一百万亩。各地人民政府在春节前后，即分别在各地召开了水利会议，并领导各地农民协会讨论兴办水利工程的详细计划。中央人民政府农业部并拨给西南区小型水利贷款一百多亿元，以解决广大农民缺少修水利资金的困难。各地农民得到人民政府这些帮助以后，情绪非常高涨。许多农民从地主恶霸手中夺回了水利权后，自动将减租所得的果实也拿出来修水利。
            华南企业公司业务进展很快
    广州市公私合营的华南企业股份有限公司成立以来，业务进展得很快。该公司是二月中旬成立的，全部股本五百亿元，分三期筹集，目前已筹集了一百亿元以上。公司全部股本中公股占百分之三十，由广东省人民政府直接投资，私股股东大部分是海外各地华侨和香港、澳门、广州、福建等地的工商界人士。三个月来，该公司配合广东省国营贸易机构购销土产的资金，累计已达一百五十亿元。四月底结算时，该公司已获纯益六亿二千多万元。为了进一步扩大业务经营范围，该公司除现设贸易、工业、投资三部外，将再增设信托、公用事业、仓库、运输等部门。
            黄河水利委员会等单位签订劳动保险集体合同
    黄河水利委员会和天津市百货、花纱布、土产公司等二十五个公营和公私合营的贸易部门的行政方面和工会，根据全国劳动保险条例实施细则第五条的规定，先后经过协商，签订了劳动保险集体合同。
    黄河水利委员会的劳动保险集体合同草案中规定，暂在各修防段（包括工程队在内）、各局直属工程队、引黄工程处、黄河水利委员会直属机工队、各测量队、各精密水准队和西北水上保持实验站、沟壑治理实验站等处重点施行。天津市百货公司等二十五个贸易部门的劳动保险集体合同规定，一切劳动保险费用，都由行政直接支付，行政方面不另缴纳劳动保险金。
            币制统一后内蒙古物价平稳  人民币受到各阶层人民欢迎
    中央人民政府政务院发布统一币制命令后，内蒙古自治区各阶层人民热烈拥护，各地银行机构收兑蒙币工作顺利进行。至四月末，据不完全统计，收回的内蒙币已达发行数字的百分之七十五强。在市场上流通的货币已有百分之九十是人民币。物价平稳，人民币在群众中威信很高。如乌兰浩特市工人们反映：“这些年来币制从来没有统一过。只有共产党毛主席领导下的新中国，才能完成这一伟大的历史任务。全国货币统一了对关内外物资交流和内蒙古经济繁荣都有利益。”通辽农民说：“以前国民党每换一回纸币，物价就上涨好多倍。有钱人更加有钱，庄稼人总是吃亏。这回币制统一，物价这样平稳，只有共产党和人民政府能够做到。”
