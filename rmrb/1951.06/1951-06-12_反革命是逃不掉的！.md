　　Counter-revolutionaries Cannot Escape!
　　Cai Xiuben
    The large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries in various regions has terrified these elements, causing them to jump and thrash about like fish caught in a net. They flee from one city to another, and then from the city to the countryside, but they can never escape the vast net of the people.
    Xu Jilin, a counter-revolutionary criminal stained with numerous blood debts in Wuxi County, fled to Shanghai after the county began its large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Seeing that Shanghai was also vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, he fled to Hangzhou. But Hangzhou was the same, so he hurriedly fled back to Shanghai. After fleeing back to Shanghai, Xu felt he still couldn't stay put, so he secretly slipped away one dark night to Changdasha Village, twelve miles from Wuxi City, and hid in the home of his mother-in-law, Ni Shenshi. Later, he felt that this was also unsafe, so he hid in the cellar under the bed of his neighbor, Ni Fengbao. Ni Fengbao was his uncle-in-law and also his accomplice.
    No matter how cunning the counter-revolutionary elements are, they can never escape the sharp eyes of the people.
    On the evening of April 19th, every family in Changdasha Village had finished dinner. The store in the village had already lit its lamps, and many people were chatting inside. Ni Qiaobao's wife, a member of the militia, was also there. At this moment, Ni Shenshi hurriedly came to buy several jin of noodles, put them in her pocket, and left. Qiaobao's wife felt this was strange: "Could it be that someone has come to her house? Why would she put the noodles in her pocket, not wanting anyone to see?"
    Qiaobao's wife sat for a while and then returned home, intending to tell her husband. However, Ni Qiaobao first told her something strange—Ni Fengbao had suddenly come to him today and said, "Someone from Shanghai is coming, just help him hide for a while, and you are guaranteed to get rich in the future, you can have whatever you want." Qiaobao said, "I refused him on the spot, I can't do anything against my conscience!" The couple put their information together and felt it was very suspicious, so they reported it to the head of the farmers' association and the militia company commander.
    Ni Renyu, the head of the farmers' association, and Ni Xiquan, the deputy militia company commander, studied the situation and estimated that Ni Fengbao and Ni Shenshi must be hiding a special agent in their home, and this agent might be Ni Shenshi's son-in-law, Xu Jilin. So, they immediately decided that Ni Xiquan would lead the militia to monitor the periphery, and also sent Ni Qiaobao's wife to Ni Shenshi's house to investigate.
    Because Xu Jilin failed to bribe the militia through Ni Fengbao, and also heard that Qiaobao's wife had come to probe, he knew that he couldn't stay for long, so he planned to find an opportunity to escape.
    On the evening of April 21st, the village cadres and militia had all gone to the city to listen to the report of the representatives of the People's Volunteer Army and had not yet returned. Xu Jilin took advantage of this gap, and Ni Yaonan (Ni Shenshi's son) escorted him to escape. At this time, Ni Xiquan was guarding outside the house and only saw two black shadows running quickly towards the east. "Who's there!" Ni Xiquan shouted, quickly stepped forward, and saw that only Ni Yaonan was left, and another black shadow was running quickly into the wheat field. It was getting dark, where could he find someone? Just as he was feeling anxious, the cadres and militia who had gone to the city to listen to the report returned. Ni Xiquan shouted loudly, "Catch the special agent!" The militia immediately beat gongs to assemble, and the peasants also came out when they heard the sound of the gongs. Ni Xiquan led more than forty militiamen to chase after them in several directions. But it was already dark, and they couldn't find anything. He immediately assigned militiamen to guard the major and minor roads and bridges, and more than two hundred men and women, young and old, in the whole village also voluntarily came to help monitor. The peasants and militia of the whole village waited like this for a whole night, and as soon as it dawned, they divided into groups to search in the wheat fields. Sure enough, not long after, they caught the bandit Xu in the wheat field of Tangdongwei.

### 反革命是逃不掉的！

　　反革命是逃不掉的！
　　蔡修本
    各地大张旗鼓镇压反革命，吓得反革命分子象落网的鱼儿那样乱跳乱窜。从这个城市逃到那个城市，又从城市逃到乡村，但是总逃不出人民满布着的天罗地网。
    无锡县血案累累的反革命罪犯许纪林，在该县开始大张旗鼓镇压反革命后逃到上海。看到上海也在大张旗鼓镇压反革命，他又逃到杭州。可是杭州也同样如此，又连忙逃回上海。许匪逃到上海后，觉得仍旧站不住脚，又偷偷地在一个黑夜里溜到离无锡市十二里的长大厦村，躲在他的岳母倪沈氏家里。后来又觉得不好，便藏在邻屋倪凤保床底下的地窖里。倪凤保是他的叔岳父，又是他的爪牙。
    无论反革命分子怎样狡猾，总是逃不过人民雪亮的眼睛。
    四月十九日晚上，长大厦村家家都吃过了晚饭。村上面店里已经上了灯，许多人在里面闲谈。民兵倪巧保的老婆也在。这时候，倪沈氏匆匆忙忙地来买了几斤面条，放在衣兜里便走了。巧保老婆感觉奇怪：“莫非她家里到了什么人？为什么要把面条放在衣兜里，不给人看见呢？”
    巧保老婆坐了一会儿便回到家里，打算告诉她丈夫。可是，倪巧保先告诉了她一件奇怪的事——今天倪凤保突来找他，说：“上海有一个人要来，只要帮助他藏一下，以后保证发财，要什么便给什么。”巧保说：“我当场就拒绝了，我不能做没有良心的事！”夫妻俩把得到的情况一碰头，觉得很可疑，于是就报告了农会主任和民兵连长。
    农会主任倪忍裕、民兵副连长倪锡泉把情况研究了一番，估计倪凤保和倪沈氏家里一定藏着一个特务，这特务可能就是倪沈氏的女婿许纪林。于是当时便决定由倪锡泉率领民兵在外围监视，又派倪巧保老婆到倪沈氏家里去侦察。
    许纪林因为通过倪凤保收买民兵不成，又听说巧保老婆来探听动静，晓得不能久留，便打算找寻时机逃跑。
    四月二十一日傍晚，村上干部和民兵都到城里听人民志愿军代表的报告还未回来，许纪林便乘此空隙，由倪耀南（倪沈氏的儿子）送他逃走。这时候，倪锡泉正在房子外面警戒，只看见两条黑影飞快地向东走去。“啥人！”倪锡泉喊了一声，快步上前，看已经只剩了倪耀南一个人，另一个黑影飞快地向麦田里跑去。天色黑下来了，一个人往那里去找？他正在焦急万分的时候，上城听报告的干部和民兵都回来了。倪锡泉便高声喊：“捉特务呀！”民兵马上敲锣集合，农民们听到锣声也都出来了。倪锡泉带领四十多个民兵分几路追赶。但是天色已黑，搜查不到。他马上分配民兵们把守大小道路和桥梁，全村男女老少二百多人也都自动来帮助监视。全村的农民、民兵就这样守候了一个整夜，等到天刚发亮，便分路到麦田里搜索。果然，不多一时，就在塘东圩的麦田里把许匪捉到了。
