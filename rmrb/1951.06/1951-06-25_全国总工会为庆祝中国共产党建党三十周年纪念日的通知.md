　　Notice from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China

　　July 1st this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the party of our own working class. For thirty years, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has been engaged in, and is continuing to engage in, a heroic struggle for its own liberation and the liberation of the people of the whole country. Countless martyrs—outstanding Communist Party members—have gloriously sacrificed their lives in this long, arduous, and great struggle, achieving the victory over imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism's long-term reactionary rule in China; and establishing a new democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Only then have we workers and all the people been freed from the shackles of imperialism and feudal forces, and achieved an unprecedentedly great victory of world significance. This great victory is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our great leader, Chairman Mao! To celebrate this great festival—the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby issues the following call to the working class of the whole country:

　　First, we must conscientiously study the glorious history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle, learn from the spirit of hard struggle and heroic sacrifice of the Chinese Communist Party's martyrs, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, constantly improve our class consciousness, and carry forward the high degree of fighting spirit to resolutely fight for the class, for the people, and for our great motherland. We must strive to become advanced elements and strive to have more Communist Party members and New Democratic Youth League members in our ranks. We must adopt the attitude and style of work that Chairman Mao taught us—being realistic, prudent and humble, guarding against arrogance and impetuosity, and working honestly—strengthen our sense of responsibility as masters of the country, give full play to our enthusiasm and creativity in our work, better fulfill our responsibility as the leading class, and victoriously complete the various tasks put forward by the Party.

　　Second, we must more extensively launch patriotic labor emulation drives, universally establish patriotic conventions, especially group patriotic conventions (that is, conventions for labor emulation with political content), and use the achievements of our emulation as a gift to celebrate the 30th anniversary of our Party. We must carry out the labor emulation drive persistently, increase production, strengthen national defense and economic strength, resolutely support the just war of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army against aggression, thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, defend world peace, and strive for a prosperous and happy new China and a socialist future! Always follow the Chinese Communist Party! Always follow Chairman Mao!

　　(The specific methods for commemorating "July 1st" by workers, staff, and masses in various localities should be arranged and carried out by trade union organizations at all levels under the unified plan and unified leadership of the local Chinese Communist Party committees.)

    第二，我们要更广泛地开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛，普遍地订立爱国公约，特别是小组爱国公约（也就是包括政治内容的劳动竞赛的公约），以我们的竞赛的成绩作为庆祝我们党的三十周年纪念日的献礼。要把劳动竞赛持久地开展下去，提高生产，加强国防力量和经济力量，坚决支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军反侵略的正义战争，彻底打败美国侵略者，保卫世界和平并为建立富强幸福的新中国，争取社会主义的前途而斗争！永远跟着中国共产党走！永远跟着毛主席走！
