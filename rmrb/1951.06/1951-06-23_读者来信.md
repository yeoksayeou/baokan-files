　　The Communist Party Rescued Me from the Sea of Misery
　　　　——Farmer Ma Deshan Recalls Life Before and After Emancipation

　　My name is Ma Deshan, and I live in Xiaohongmen Village, District 11, Beijing. I am sixty-one years old this year. I suffered a lifetime of hardship, and it was not until the Communist Party came that I was rescued from the sea of misery. When drinking sweet water, one must not forget the well-digger; I will always follow the Communist Party.

　　I started working for landlords as a hired hand at the age of ten. After working until I was fifty-three years old, the landlord saw that I was getting old and no longer wanted me. I couldn't find work, so I had to take odd jobs and sell Chinese cabbage in the winter. My family of four (me, my wife, and two children) barely managed to survive. When it comes to the suffering I endured, it's truly endless. When I worked for the landlord, a year's wages weren't enough to feed my family for half a year. Back then, my wife and children never had a carefree meal. Every spring, they had to go to the fields to dig up wild vegetables to eat. My wife was often hungry and developed a shivering illness from starvation. My two children often cried from hunger. We lived in a dilapidated thatched house, and for many years, the four of us only had one tattered quilt and no mat for the bed. The clothes we wore were patched upon patched, one layer on top of another, like a "patch mountain."

　　I had long heard that there was a Communist Party leading the revolution to free us from oppression. I thought to myself: When will the Communist Party come? I eagerly waited, hoping the Communist Party would come soon.

　　The good days finally arrived. In December 1948, the People's Liberation Army surrounded Beijing, and the PLA was stationed just three miles from Xiaohongmen Village. At that time, I was suffering from hemoptysis and couldn't walk because of my illness. But I thought, if I could see the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, I would die without regret. Despite my illness, I mustered all my strength and went to see the People's Liberation Army. I was so happy that I didn't know what to say.

　　After Beijing was liberated, during the land reform in the outskirts of Beijing, my family was allocated ten mu of dry land, one mu and two fen of paddy field, one and a half rooms, and also a mule and farm tools. I had never owned a piece of land the size of my finger in my entire life! In the past, when I farmed for the landlord, the corn grew well, but it all belonged to the landlord. Now I farm for myself, and the crops that grow are mine. Last year, I hoed the dry land seven times. Even though it was flooded, I still harvested twenty-five shi (each shi is 150 jin) of corn! My family added two new quilts, and my two sons also got new clothes. We also added some household items. Before, we didn't have a water vat, and we had to carry a load of water for every meal; now a large water vat is placed in our home. I often say: Our new life was brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We must do a good job in production! This year, I plan to hoe the land eight times, and I have already hoed it four times. When it comes to paying the public grain, we will give whatever the country needs. My eldest son, Ma Chunrong, is now the glorious secretary of the Youth League branch in our village. I often tell him: "We and the Communist Party are of one heart! You must be at the forefront in doing things for the village and the country. We are living a good life, but we must not forget the days of hunger!"

　　I am sixty-one years old this year. If it weren't for the Communist Party, I would have died long ago. In the year that Beijing was liberated, I was so sick that my hands trembled when I ate. Now I can hold a hoe and till the land. My life was saved by the Communist Party. I cannot forget Chairman Mao and the Communist Party; I will always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!
　　　　Narrated by Ma Deshan, a farmer in District 11, Beijing (Recorded by Wang Daming)

　　Chairman Mao and the Communist Party Saved My Child
　　　　——Letter from a Housewife in District 3, Beijing

　　Editor:
　　On April 6th of this year, my two-year-old daughter, Ailun, suddenly contracted scarlet fever. As directed by the Health Bureau, I sent her to the Communicable Disease Hospital on Dafosi West Street. After arriving at the hospital, my child was carefully diagnosed and treated by the doctors and carefully cared for by the nurses. In six days, my child was out of danger and reborn. My family has seven members and relies on my husband's salary to make a living, so the economy is quite difficult. After obtaining certification from government agencies, the hospital provided free treatment for my child. I think, in the old society, a child from a family like ours who contracted such a disease would only have been left to die, or to infect a second or third child. Because at that time, our own family could not even eat enough, let alone have money to buy medicine for treatment, and the reactionary government would not have cared about sending you to the hospital. Therefore, I feel that we are indeed living a democratic and happy life now. This happiness was brought to us by our people's wise leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I am very grateful to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and I firmly oppose the aggression of American imperialism and defend our happy life.
　　　　Resident Xu Zhongcuihua, No. 4 Wangfuma Hutong, Inner District 3, Beijing

　　"Use the Precious Gifts of the Motherland's People Where the Motherland Needs Them Most!"
　　Comrade Liao Chengzhi and to All Comrades of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea:

　　You have come to Korea with the hearts of 475 million people of the motherland to express your sympathy to us. All the comrades are extremely moved. Everyone will redouble their efforts in combat to repay your sympathy.

　　I received the 50,000 yuan in comfort money you brought. When the superiors handed it to me, they told me, "This is the heart of the people of the motherland." I was very excited at the time. I found two clean sheets of paper, wrapped the money, and put it in my pocket.

　　Last night, I heard on the radio the call of the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea for promoting patriotic conventions, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. I recorded this news and read it carefully several times. In order to enable us to achieve final victory as soon as possible, the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has issued a solemn call to the people of the whole country. As a Chinese person, in addition to redoubling my efforts in combat and completing all the tasks assigned by my superiors, I must also respond to this call. I want to use the precious gifts of the people of the motherland where the motherland needs them most! I took out the 50,000 yuan in comfort money that I had placed in front of my chest, plus some of the allowances I had saved over the past few months, and gathered a total of 140,000 yuan, which I handed over to the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea.

　　The power of the Chinese people is great. If people from all walks of life in China unite and make donations through increasing production and increasing income, the donation movement will achieve great success.

　　Finally, I extend my highest and warmest regards to you and the people of the whole country!
　　　　Wang Zhizhong, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers
　　Editor's Note: The donation has been forwarded by this newspaper.

　　Our Hoes Produce Airplanes!
　　Villages in District 11, Beijing Suburbs Discuss Increasing Production and Making Donations

　　Editor:
　　Villages in District 11, Beijing suburbs are now holding village people's representative conferences one after another to discuss the formulation or revision of patriotic conventions and to discuss the donation of airplanes and cannons. In villages that produce vegetables, such as Shiliuzhuang and Shicun, farmers have proposed plans to increase vegetable production through more fertilization and watering for donations. Shan Qibin, a farmer in Shiliuzhuang, said: "In the second year after liberation, I bought a big black donkey and a cart (what kind of cart is not specified). This year, I am planning to rebuild three houses. Now that life is better, we know how to protect our good life, so I want to donate 500,000 yuan to buy airplanes and cannons." Farmer Yan Xiangxi said: "If I work a little harder and water the crops one more time, I can increase production by a lot, so I will also donate 500,000 yuan." Zhao Deliang, a resident of Xiaocun, recalled that he could not make ends meet during the enemy puppet era, but now that life is better, in order to preserve his good life and quickly eliminate the American bandits, he will also donate 300,000 yuan. Yu Deshui, a farmer in Shicun, and his two brothers were all hired laborers before liberation and lived a very hard life. After liberation, they were allocated land and turned over. This time, when donating airplanes and cannons, the three brothers decided to donate 200,000 yuan. Women in several villages have put forward the slogan: "We will produce airplanes from the eyes of needles!" Li Wenzhen, a woman in Shicun, donated 80,000 yuan from her embroidery earnings. Woman Li Baoqin also donated 80,000 yuan. Zhao Jinglan and Zhao Jinying, women in Xiaocun, each donated 20,000 yuan from their embroidery work. Villages in Yilezhuang, Sihezhuang, and Sihai Zhuang that produce cotton have all proposed a plan to increase cotton production by five jin per mu this year. Farmer Yu Chaokai said: "Our hoes produce airplanes!" The plan put forward by the farmers of Xihongmen Village is: hoe the land one more time to guarantee an increase of five jin of grain per mu to buy airplanes and cannons to dedicate to the Volunteers. Now, most of the village people's representative conferences have been completed, and the patriotic conventions have added new content of increasing production and donating airplanes and cannons.

    共产党把我救出苦海
        ——农民马德山回忆翻身前后
    我叫马德山，住在北京十一区小红门村，今年六十一岁。我受了一辈子的苦，直到共产党来了，才把我从苦海里救了出来。吃甜水不能忘了掏井人，我永远要跟着共产党走。
    我打十岁起就给地主扛活。扛到五十三岁，地主看我岁数大了，就不要我了。我找不上活，只得打短工，冬天卖小白菜。我家里四口人（我、我老婆和两个孩子）凑合着能活命。要提起我受过的苦，真是说也说不完。我给地主扛活时，一年的工钱还不够让家里吃半年饭，那时，我老婆孩子就从没吃过一顿松心饭。每年春天，他们就得上地里拔野菜吃。我老婆经常挨饿，饿坏了，得了个哆嗦病。两个孩子时常饿的哭。我们住在破烂草房里，多少年来，一家四口，总共只有一条破被子，连个炕席都没有。我们穿的衣服，补上加补，一块叠一块，就像个“补钉山”似的。
    我早就听说过，有个共产党，为了使我们不再受压迫，在领导革命。我心里就想：共产党多久会来呢？我左盼右盼，盼共产党早些来。
    好日子到底盼到了。一九四八年十二月，解放军包围了北京城，离小红门村三里多的地方就驻了解放军。那时，我正患吐血病，病得不能走路。但我想，我要能见到共产党、解放军，我死了也不冤了。我抱着病一股气走去，见到了解放军，我高兴得不知说什么才好。
    北京解放后，京郊土地改革时，我家分到了十亩旱地、一亩二分水地，一间半房，还有骡子、农具等。我一生还没有过手指头大的地呀！过去我给地主种地，玉蜀黍长的好是好，可全是地主家的。现在我为自己种地，长了庄稼是自己的。去年，我种的旱地耪了七遍，水淹了，我还打二十五石（每石一五○斤）玉米呢！我家添了两床新被子，我的两个儿子也穿上了新衣裳。家里用的东西也添了些。以前家里没有水缸，吃一顿饭要担一挑水；现在大水缸摆在家里了。我常说：我们的新光景是共产党、毛主席带给我们的。我们要不好好搞生产还行！？今年我准备把地耪八遍，现在已经耪了四遍。到交公粮的时候，国家需要什么咱就给什么。我的大儿子马春荣现在光荣地当了本村青年团支部书记。我常对他说：“我们和共产党是一条心啊！村里的事、国家的事，你都要抢在前头干。咱们过了好光景，可不能忘了挨饿的日子！”
    我今年六十一岁了。要是没有共产党，我早就死了。在北京解放那一年，我病得吃饭时手都哆嗦。现在我能拿锄耪地了。我的命是共产党救的。我不能忘了毛主席共产党，我永远要跟着毛主席共产党走！
        北京市第十一区农民马德山口述（王大明记）
  毛主席共产党救了我的孩子
  ——北京市第三区一个家庭妇女的来信编辑同志：
    在今年四月六日，我的两岁的小女孩爱伦，忽然得了猩红热。经卫生局指示，我把她送到了大佛寺西大街传染病院。孩子到院后，经该院大夫们细心诊治，和护士同志的细心照顾，六天时间，孩子就脱离危险得到了重生。我家共有七口人，依靠我丈夫一个人的薪金维持生活，经济是相当困难的，经过政府机关的证明，院里就给我的孩子免费治疗。我想，在旧社会，像我们这样家庭的小孩子得了这样的病，那只有等死，或者传染到第二个，第三个小孩子。因为在那时，自己一家人既吃不饱饭，更不会有钱买药治病，当时的反动政府更不会照顾你去住院。因此，我感觉到我们现在确实是得到了民主幸福。这幸福是我们人民英明的领袖毛主席和共产党给我们带来的。我很感谢毛主席和共产党，并坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫我们的幸福生活。

  “把祖国人民的珍贵礼物，用在祖国最需要的地方！”廖承志同志并转中国人民赴朝慰问团全体同志：
    你们带着祖国人民四亿七千五百万颗心，到朝鲜来慰问我们。同志们都感动极了。大家都要加倍努力战斗来报答你们的慰问。
    我拿到了你们带来的五万元慰劳金。上级交给我时，告诉我说：“这是祖国人民的心意。”我当时非常激动。我找了两张洁白的纸，把钱包好，放在口袋里。
    昨天晚上，我在收音机中听到了中国人民抗美援朝总会关于推行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召。我把这个新闻记录了下来，细心地读了好几遍。中国人民抗美援朝总会为了使我们早日得到最后胜利，向全国人民发出了庄严的号召。作为中国人民的我，除了要加倍努力地战斗，完成上级所给的一切任务外，我也要响应这个号召。我要把祖国人民的珍贵礼物用在祖国最需要的地方！我把放在胸前的五万元慰劳金拿出来，加上我几月来所积蓄的一些津贴费，一共凑了十四万元，交给抗美援朝总会。
    中国人民的力量是伟大的。全中国各界人民一致起来用增加生产、增加收入的办法进行捐献，捐献运动就会得到巨大的成就。
    最后，向你们和全国人民致最崇高亲切的敬礼！
          中国人民志愿军某部  汪执中
    编者按：捐款已由本报代转。
  我们锄头底下出飞机！
  京郊十一区各村讨论增产捐献编辑同志：
    北京市郊第十一区各村，现在纷纷举行村人民代表会议，商量关于制订或修订爱国公约，及讨论捐献飞机大炮的事情。在石榴庄、时村等出产菜蔬的村庄，农民们提出多施肥、多浇水增加菜蔬生产的捐献计划。石榴庄农民单起彬说：解放后第二年，我买了一头大黑驴和一个车（什么车未写明），今年计算着要翻盖三间房子；生活过好了，我们知道保卫我们的好生活，所以我要捐五十万元买飞机大炮。农民阎祥西说：我多卖点力气，多浇一次水，就可以增产不少东西，因此我也捐献五十万元。萧村居民赵德亮回忆过去敌伪时代自己生活顾不住，现在生活好了，为了保住好生活，很快地消灭美国强盗，也要捐献三十万元。时村农民于德水，兄弟三人解放前都是雇工，生活非常困苦；解放后分到土地翻了身。这次捐献飞机大炮时，弟兄三人决定捐献二十万元。有几村的妇女提出口号说：我们要从针眼里出飞机！时村妇女李文珍捐出自己的绣花工钱八万元。妇女李宝琴也捐献八万元。萧村妇女赵景兰、赵金英各捐作绣活的工钱二万元。怡乐庄四合庄四海庄等产棉村都提出今年每亩棉花要增产五斤的计划。农民于朝凯说：咱们的锄头出飞机！西红门村农民提出的计划是：多锄一遍地，保证每亩多产五斤粮，买飞机大炮献给志愿军。现在各村人民代表会议大部开完，爱国公约里边已经增加了增加生产捐献飞机大炮的新内容。
