　　Xinhua News Agency, June 28th dispatch from New York, TASS: The Chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, Kingsbury, sent a telegram to the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik, on June 22nd, the tenth anniversary of Hitler's Germany's perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, praising the Soviet Union's glorious contributions in the anti-fascist war.

　　Kingsbury's telegram stated: "The American people remember with respect and gratitude the sacrifices made by the Soviet Union and the destruction it suffered in the struggle for common victory. Despite the growth of irresponsible and malicious war provocations in our country, seeking to destroy the ties we established during the alliance, our friendship can be maintained. The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship is convinced that the cooperation between our two nations in defending peace and opposing the forces of war will be victorious."

　　Malik has replied to Kingsbury, expressing thanks.

　　Malik's reply stated: "The Second World War imposed on humanity by Hitler's Germany caused the loss of millions of lives and immense damage to the material and cultural treasures of various countries. Only six years have passed since the end of this war, and a new aggressive group of nations, united by the so-called North Atlantic Treaty, has emerged. The aggressive policies of this group of nations, led by the ruling circles of the United States, have caused the waves of militarism to begin engulfing these countries. An arms expansion movement is underway, and attempts to remilitarize Germany and Japan are creating a grave danger of another world war. Under these circumstances, the resolute struggle of the peoples of all countries for peace against the provocateurs of a new war is of great significance. The Soviet people contribute all their strength to peaceful construction and to the struggle for peace, for strengthening friendship and peace among the peoples of all countries. The Soviet people fully share your sentiments and believe that the lofty hope of the American people and the Soviet people for peace will overcome the forces of war and will be able to maintain peace throughout the world."

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 28th dispatch from New York: The American people's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question has been particularly strongly expressed recently in their support for the proposal by Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson to end the Korean War.

　　Johnson submitted a proposal to the U.S. Senate on May 17th, advocating a ceasefire in Korea starting on June 25th, the withdrawal of both sides participating in the Korean War from the 38th parallel, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. As the anniversary of the Korean War approaches, people from all walks of life in the United States have increasingly expressed support for Johnson's proposal.

　　The American Progressive Party issued a statement calling on Truman to take immediate action to enact Johnson's proposal into law. The statement said: The American people need an active policy of striving for peace, and Johnson's proposal provides a plan for the government and its critics to follow.

　　For more than a month, the United Electrical Workers Union, the Seafarers Cooks and Waiters Union, and the political action committees of the United Auto Workers Union's Detroit Ford plant local and the Great "Dodge" local have all expressed support for Johnson's proposal. Even the right-wing leader of the Ford auto workers union, local chairman Stellato, gave a speech calling for peace through negotiations, in view of the union members' widespread demand for peace.

　　The annual meeting of the Methodist Church, representing one hundred and seventy-seven churches, recently unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Senate to immediately pass Johnson's proposal. The Pasadena Peace Committee of the American Friends Service Committee in California also supports Johnson's proposal.

　　In the U.S. Senate, four senators have already expressed support for Johnson's ceasefire proposal.

　　马立克与美苏友好全国委员会交换电报
    保证苏美两国人民共同争取和平
    美国广大人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：美苏友好全国委员会主席金斯柏利，在六月二十二日希特勒德国背信弃义进攻苏联十周年纪念日，致电苏联驻联合国代表马立克，赞扬苏联在反法西斯战争中的光辉贡献。
    金斯柏利的电报说：“美国人以尊敬和感谢的心情，记住苏联所作的牺牲和它在为争取共同胜利的斗争中所遭受的破坏。尽管不负责任的和恶意的战争挑拨在我国增长，想破坏我们在联盟时期所建立的联系，我们的友谊是能够维持的。美苏友好全国委员会深信：我们两个民族保卫和平反对战争力量的合作将得到胜利。”
    马立克已复电金斯柏利致谢。
    马立克的复电说：“希特勒德国强加诸人类的第二次世界战争，使千百万生灵涂炭，使各国的物质上与文化上的珍宝遭到巨大损失。自这个战争结束以来不过六年，由所谓北大西洋公约联合起来的新的侵略国家集团又产生了。以美国统治集团为首的这个国家集团的侵略政策，使军国主义的波涛已在开始吞没这些国家。扩张军备运动正在进行，德日重新军国主义化的企图造成了另一次世界大战的严重危险。在这种情况下，各国人民争取和平反对新战争挑拨者的坚决斗争具有非常的意义。苏联人民以一切力量贡献给和平建设与争取和平、争取加强各国人民间的友好与和平的斗争。苏联人民与你具有充分的同感，相信美国人民与苏联人民的要求和平的崇高希望，一定会战胜战争的力量，一定能够保持全世界的和平。”
    【新华社二十八日讯】纽约消息：美国人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的意愿，最近特别强烈地表现在支持科罗拉多州民主党参议员约翰逊关于停止朝鲜战争的建议上。
    约翰逊在上月十七日向美国参院提出一项提案，主张于六月二十五日起在朝鲜停火，参加朝鲜战争的双方撤离三八线，并自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。随着朝鲜战争一周年纪念日的临近，美国各阶层人民已越来越广泛地对约翰逊提案表示支持。
    美国进步党曾发表声明，要求杜鲁门立即采取行动，将约翰逊提案制定为法律。声明说：美国人民需要争取和平的积极政策，约翰逊提案提供了一个可供政府及其批评者遵循的方案。
    一个多月以来，联合电气工人工会、海员厨师侍者工会、联合汽车工人工会底特律福特汽车厂分会和大“道奇”分会的政治行动委员会都已表示支持约翰逊提案。连福特汽车工人工会的右派领袖、分会主席斯特拉多，鉴于工会会员普遍的和平要求，也发表演说，要求以谈判实现和平。
    代表一百七十七个教堂的美以美教会年会最近一致通过决议，要求参院立即通过约翰逊提案。加利福尼亚州美国公谊服务会的派沙德那和平委员会也支持约翰逊提案。
    在美国参议院中，已有四名参议员表示支持约翰逊的停火建议。
