　　Land Reform Movement in Rural East China
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Gu Hong
    Through the land reform movement last winter and this spring, the feudal land system in the vast rural areas of East China has been completely eliminated in most areas. The peasants who have stood up from the land reform movement are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the patriotic production movement.

    The peasant movements in various parts of East China were launched successively in mid-December of last year and early January of this year, and quickly formed a climax. From late March to early April this year, the land reform movements in various places gradually ended, and the production movement gradually unfolded. According to preliminary statistics: by the end of April, the areas in East China that had completed land distribution included 45 special districts, 297 counties (excluding those that had completed a part), and 35,656 townships (or villages) (accounting for 81 percent of the total number of townships in the region), with a total population of 105 million (accounting for 85.7 percent of the region's agricultural population). More than 7,000 townships (or villages) in the old areas of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu have been issued land certificates. The work of issuing land certificates in the new areas has been started by various provinces (regions) for typical experiments. Forty-six experimental townships in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu have also issued land certificates. In addition, suburban areas of cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Wuhu, and Fuzhou are now also carrying out land reform, which is expected to be largely completed by the end of July. The areas in East China that have not yet started land reform include the flood-stricken areas of Northern Anhui, the coastal mountainous areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, and some disaster-stricken villages in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu (approximately 17.5 million people in total). These areas will implement land reform during the slack farming season in the future and strive to complete it by the end of this year.

    The progress of the land reform movement in East China has been smooth and normal. In the early stages of the movement, around the Spring Festival, and when spring plowing was approaching, more or less hasty and rash phenomena occurred in rural work in various places; however, these phenomena were promptly corrected after being pointed out by the local CPC committees and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. During the movement, the East China Bureau and the leading organs of various provinces and regions attached great importance to inspection work, checking while doing. First, for places where more problems and complexities occurred, the leading organs selected strong cadres to go for direct guidance. Second, during the Spring Festival, various places conducted centralized training for cadres participating in land reform work, educating cadres by summarizing experiences, which was very effective. This enabled the later stage of land reform work to avoid many detours. Third, for some individual shortcomings in the movement, the East China Bureau adopted the method of educating cadres from a positive perspective and guiding the movement in the correct direction, rather than negative criticism. This made the cadres participating in land reform work happy and proactive in correcting shortcomings. Fourth, during the movement, various provinces (regions) established transportation networks in most counties and districts. This enabled timely understanding of the progress of the movement, and any deviations could be immediately corrected. Fifth, during the land reform movement, East China also combined it with the anti-American and aid-Korea movement and the mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, which were as extensive as the land reform movement. This further enhanced the political awareness of the peasants, powerfully supported the land reform movement, and shattered the deep-rooted feudal ruling forces in the countryside.

    According to statistics from Southern Jiangsu, a total of 6 million peasants in the district were involved in the struggle during this movement. The landlords who had always ridden roughshod over the peasants were subjected to varying degrees of just strikes by the local peasants. The local people's courts sanctioned the blood-debt-ridden local bullies and lawless landlords. In the land reform movement in East China, the peasant associations have developed, with members generally accounting for about 30 percent of the agricultural population, and 50 percent in some areas. At present, there are 32.5 million members of peasant associations in East China, more than double the number before the movement. The militia in various places has also developed greatly during the movement. In addition, East China paid great attention to mobilizing both male and female peasants in this land reform movement. Therefore, the political awareness of rural women in various places has also been improved. During the movement, they actively participated in the anti-feudal struggle. Women account for 15.46 million of the aforementioned number of peasant association members. Moreover, many women have been selected as cadres of peasant associations or rural governments. During this land reform movement, the New Democratic Youth League has also developed greatly in rural East China, and many activists among the young peasants have become members of the Youth League. They are now the strong backbone for launching patriotic movements and carrying out production and construction in rural East China.

    In the rural areas where land reform has been implemented, the peasants are happily cultivating their own land. The peasants in various places believe that after this land reform, they have "divided the land, vented their anger, turned themselves over, and seen the light of day." Now, they are putting all their efforts into the patriotic production increase movement. The peasants of Zhejiang Province alone have initiated and built more than 20,000 farmland water conservancy projects this year, an unprecedented scale.

    The more than 35,000 townships in East China that have implemented land reform have uneven development due to different working foundations, cadres, and other conditions. Based on whether land reform is thorough and whether the masses are well mobilized, they can be divided into three categories: The first category is where land reform has been thorough, there are few remaining problems, and a large-scale production movement has been launched relatively smoothly. This type of area accounts for about 30 percent of the townships in which land reform has been implemented in various provinces (regions), and 40 percent in individual provinces. The main task of this type of area in the future is to conclude land reform and issue land certificates. The second category is where land reform has been basically thorough, but because the cadres have been too hasty and rash in their work, the class components of individual households have been wrongly classified, and some of the fruits of the struggle have not been distributed. This type of area accounts for about 50 percent. The third category of areas (this category is not many as a whole township), although land reform has been implemented, it is not thorough. The reasons for not being thorough are either because the cadres have taken over and replaced the masses without fully mobilizing the peasant masses; or because the cadres are impure in their composition and have protected the landlords; or because the cadres have not earnestly implemented the line of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants and uniting with middle peasants in their work. Based on the above situation, various places in East China are preparing to conduct inspections during the future slack farming season, so as to adopt different methods to handle the conclusion of land reform work.

### 华东农村土地改革运动

　　华东农村土地改革运动
    新华社记者　孤鸿
    华东区广大农村经过去冬今春的土地改革运动，绝大部分地区的封建土地制度已被彻底消灭了。从土地改革运动中站起来的农民，正热烈地投入爱国生产运动。
    去年十二月中旬和今年一月上旬，华东各地的农民运动先后全面展开，很快就形成了高潮。今年三月下旬到四月上旬，各地的土地改革运动逐步结束，生产运动逐渐展开。据初步的统计：到四月底止，华东全区已经完成土地分配的地区包括四十五个专区，二百九十七个县（已经完成一部分的未计在内），三万五千六百五十六个乡（或村）（占全区总乡数百分之八十一），共一亿零五百万人口（占全区农业人口百分之八十五点七）。山东、苏北老区有七千余乡（或村）已经颁发了土地证。新区颁发土地证的工作，各省（区）已开始进行典型试验，浙江和苏南也有四十六个试验乡发了土地证。此外上海、南京、杭州、济南、青岛、徐州、芜湖、福州……等城市市郊区，现在也都正在进行土地改革，预计七月底可大体完成。华东尚未开始实行土地改革的地区，有皖北的水灾区，浙江和福建的沿海山区和山东、苏北一部分有灾的乡村（共约一千七百五十万人）。这些地区将在今后农闲时实行土地改革，争取在今年年底完成。
    华东土地改革运动的进程是顺利的和正常的。在运动展开的初期、春节前后和春耕快到来的时候，各地农村工作中都曾经或多或少地发生过急躁草率的现象；但是，这些现象，在当地中共党委和中共中央华东局指出后，都及时得到了纠正。运动中，华东局和各省、区领导机关，都很重视检查工作，边做边查。一、对发生问题较多较复杂的地方，领导机关曾选派强有力的干部前往进行直接指导。二、春节期间，各地都曾集训参加土地改革工作的干部，用总结经验的办法教育干部，收效很大。这样，就使后期土地改革工作少走了许多弯路。三、对于运动中的某些个别缺点，华东局采取从积极方面教育干部，引导运动向正确方向前进的方法去加以纠正，而不是消极的批评。这样，就使参加土地改革工作的干部对于改正缺点，是愉快的和积极的。四、运动中，各省（区）在大部县、区都建立了交通网。这样，就能及时了解运动进展的情况，一有偏差，能予立即纠正。五、各地在土地改革运动中，都结合进行了与土地改革运动同样广泛的抗美援朝运动和群众性的镇压反革命运动。这样，就进一步提高了农民的政治觉悟，有力地支持了土地改革运动，粉碎了农村中根深蒂固的封建统治势力。
    据苏南区的统计，该区这次运动中卷入斗争的农民共有六百万人。一贯骑在农民头上作威作福的地主，大部都受到了当地农民不同程度的正义打击。血债累累的恶霸和不法地主，都受到了当地人民法庭的制裁。华东各地在这次土地改革运动中，农民协会都发展了，会员一般已占农业人口的百分之三十左右，个别地区占百分之五十。现在，华东全区农民协会会员共三千二百五十万人，比运动前增加一倍多。各地民兵在运动中也有很大的发展。此外，这次土地改革运动中，华东很注意对男女农民的一齐发动。因此，各地农村妇女的政治觉悟也提高了。运动中，她们积极参加了反封建的斗争行列。上述农民协会会员的数目中，妇女占一千五百四十六万。而且有许多妇女已被选拔为农民协会或乡村政权的干部。这次土地改革运动中，新民主主义青年团在华东农村中也有很大的发展，青年农民中的积极分子多已成为青年团员。他们现在是华东农村中展开爱国主义运动和进行生产建设的坚强骨干。
    实行了土地改革的农村，农民们都欢天喜地的在自己的土地上耕作了。各地农民都认为，这次土地改革后，他们是“分了地、出了气、翻了身、见了天”。现在，他们正以全力投入爱国增产运动。浙江全省农民今年自己发动兴修的农田水利就有二万多处，规模是空前大的。
    华东已实行土地改革的三万五千多个乡，因为工作基础、干部等条件不同，工作的发展是不平衡的。根据土地改革彻底不彻底，群众发动得好不好来检查，可分作三类地区：第一类地区，土地改革已经彻底了，遗留的问题不多，已经比较顺利地展开了大生产运动。这种地区在各省（区）实行土地改革的乡中约占百分之三十，个别省占百分之四十。这种地区今后的工作，主要是结束土地改革，颁发土地证。第二类地区，土地改革基本上彻底了，但是，因为干部在工作中有过急躁草率的现象，把个别户的阶级成分划错了，而且还有一部分斗争果实没有分配。这种地区约占百分之五十。第三类地区（这一类是一个整乡的不多），虽然实行了土地改革，但是还不彻底。不彻底的原因，或者是由于干部包办代替，没有充分发动农民群众；或者是由于干部成分不纯，包庇了地主；或者是由于干部在工作中没有认真执行依靠贫雇农团结中农的路线。根据以上情况，华东各地准备在今后农闲的时候进行检查，以便采用不同办法，来办理土地改革的结束工作。
