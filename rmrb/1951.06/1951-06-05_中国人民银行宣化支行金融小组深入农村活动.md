To the Editor:

　　The Xuanhua Branch of the People's Bank of China, Chahar Province, sent out financial work teams to the countryside in early March this year to conduct deposit and loan business on a trial basis, which was welcomed by the peasants. It has played a significant role in enlivening rural finance and promoting rural production. I am now informing you of the work of the county branch during this period.

　　The branch sent out a total of thirty cadres, organizing seven rural financial work teams, operating in five districts and fifty-six villages. They absorbed the idle funds and surplus grain of the peasants, handled deposit business, and provided loans to the peasants to solve their production difficulties. In addition, they also handled livestock insurance and the collection of raw gold and silver. As of the end of April, they had established deposit relationships with 15,544 households, receiving various deposits, including value-guaranteed deposits, fixed and current deposits, and prize-winning savings, totaling 393,429,000 yuan. There were 802 households who took out loans from the bank. A total of 183,460,000 yuan was lent for livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, medicine, weddings and funerals, transportation and sales, seeds, and construction.

　　The branch encouraged farmers to save money by encouraging savings and deposits, and also provided loans to help farmers solve difficulties in production and life. Gujiaying Village used fertilizer loans to buy 94 loads of manure. Liu Chengmei of the village said, "This way, our village can produce a lot more grain." The bank supported fourteen labor exchange groups with a loan of 18,790,000 yuan. For example, women in Songjiazhuang collectively developed sideline production, taking out a loan of 1,360,000 yuan to buy 34 piglets. In addition, it also solved many urgent difficulties for the peasants. Li Jiayi of Dabaozi Village used a loan of 300,000 to marry off his son. He said, "Otherwise, I would have been waiting for a daughter-in-law but unable to marry her." Children in the Nihezi Village area generally suffered from measles, and the financial team actively provided loans to the masses to buy medicine for treatment.

　　Statistics from the seven teams as of the end of April showed that they had completed livestock insurance for 459 heads of livestock, and collected 636 taels of silver and 595 silver dollars. Many old ladies took their ancestral silver jewelry to the financial team to exchange for RMB.

　　In order to make it convenient for depositors to withdraw money, the financial team sent people to deliver the money when the deposit matured. Zhang Yu, an old man from Qujiazhuang, said, "I used to be afraid that it would be inconvenient to withdraw deposits, so I only deposited one stone of rice. You delivered it! I'll deposit another stone!" Peasants in Zhoujiagou jointly wrote a letter requesting the financial team to carry out livestock insurance business in the village, and 19 households with livestock voluntarily signed up for insurance.

　　The financial work team of Xuanhua County was warmly supported by the masses wherever it went. The masses talked about how their difficulties had been solved and how they had been served, and they demanded that the work of the financial team be carried out for a long time.

　　中国人民银行宣化支行金融小组深入农村活动编辑同志：
    中国人民银行察哈尔省宣化支行，从今年三月初派出金融工作小组，深入农村，试办存放款业务，受到农民的欢迎。对活跃农村金融，推动农村生产，起了很大作用。今将该县支行这一期间工作情况告诉你们。
    该行共派出三十名干部，组织了七个农村金融工作小组，活动在五个区、五十六个村庄。吸收农民的游资及富余的粮食，办理存款业务，并向农民放款，解决农民生产上的困难问题。此外并办理牲畜保险，收兑生金银等业务。截止四月底，共与一万五千五百四十四户建立了存款关系，收到保本保值存款、定期及活期存款、有奖储蓄等各种存款共三亿九千三百四十二万九千元。向银行贷款的有八百零二户。共贷出牲畜、农具、肥料、医药、婚丧、运销、籽种、修建等各种贷款一亿八千三百四十六万元。
    该行吸收存款，鼓励农民进行节约储蓄，放款则很好地帮助农民解决生产和生活的困难。顾家营村以肥料贷款买大粪九十四担，该村刘成美说：“这么一来俺村就能多打不少粮食。”银行以一千八百七十九万元的贷款，扶植了十四个拨工组。如宋家庄妇女，集体开展副业生产，贷款一百三十六万元，买回小猪三十四口。除此以外，也解决了农民不少的紧急困难，大堡子村李家义以三十万贷款给儿子结了婚，他说：“不是这样，眼巴巴等着媳妇却不能娶。”泥合子村一带的儿童，普遍害麻疹，金融小组也积极地贷款给群众买药治病。
    七个小组截止四月底统计：共完成牲口保险四百五十九头，收兑白银六百三十六两，银元五百九十五块。好多老太太，把祖传百世留下来的银首饰，都拿着到金融小组兑换人民币。
    金融小组为使存户提取方便，存款到期时有专人给送，屈家庄张玉老汉说：“我以前怕存款取着不便利，只存了一石米，你们给送来啦！我再存上一石吧！”周家沟农民，联名写信要求金融小组到该村开展牲口保险业务，并有十九家有牲口户，自动报名投保。
    宣化县金融工作小组所到之处受到群众的热烈拥护，群众纷纷谈论给他们解决了困难，服了务，要求金融小组的工作长期地开展下去。
