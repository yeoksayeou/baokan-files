Shenyang Workers, Students, and Business Community
	Enthusiastically Participate in Patriotic Donation Movement
    Workers, students, and the business community in Shenyang City are enthusiastically responding to the call of the China Peace Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation, actively participating in the movement to donate airplanes, cannons, and tanks. Workers in the iron casting workshop of a state-owned mechanical repair factory decided to work an extra day on Sunday and donate all of their wages, totaling 9.1 million yuan. They also pledged to strive to increase production, complete June's production tasks ahead of schedule, and improve the quality of first-class products from 20% to 70%, completely eliminating third-class products and rejects. All employees of the Shenyang Paint Factory have already donated all wages earned on the 4th of this month and have decided to donate one day's work each month until the final victory in the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea.
    Teachers and students of the Shenyang Municipal Cadre School donated eight gold rings, twenty-two watches, and cash, etc., in one day. The Youth League group of the Teaching Section of the Industrial Advanced Vocational School collectively donated five days of work. Teachers and students of various municipal middle schools are enthusiastically donating money and materials, and are also preparing to carry out publicity to mobilize the masses to actively donate. Cao Bolong, manager of the privately-owned Dayu Iron Factory, has already donated 10 million yuan and has expressed his intention to increase production and continue to donate.
