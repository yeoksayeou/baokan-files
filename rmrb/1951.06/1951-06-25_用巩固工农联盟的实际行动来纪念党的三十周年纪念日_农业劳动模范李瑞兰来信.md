　　Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Party with Practical Actions to Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance
   Letter from Agricultural Labor Model Li Ruilan
To the Editor:

　　The 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China is approaching. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the working people of our country have become the masters of the country, and their lives are getting better day by day. The struggles of the Chinese people have achieved great victories and will continue to achieve even greater victories. These are all the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China.

　　Looking at the good times now, I naturally recall the painful days of the past when I was worse than a beast of burden. When I was eleven years old, my father passed away. The family couldn't make a living, so they sold my seven-year-old second sister and four-year-old third sister to the landlord in exchange for fifty catties of soybeans. My mother, elder sister, younger brother, and I ate these soybeans mixed with tree leaves for more than three months. My mother and brother ate tree leaves until their faces were swollen and their skin was broken, and my eyes were so swollen that I couldn't see anything. I couldn't even see the door when begging for food. When my mother saw that life was impossible, she took my elder sister and remarried. My younger brother starved to death. Only I, an eleven-year-old, was left alone in the family, begging for food with a stick, and I couldn't get even a third of my fill every day. When I was thirteen, I herded pigs for the landlord. When the wheat ripened, the landlord asked me to cut wheat every day like an adult. I cut wheat for three days without rest, and my waist was injured. It still hurts whenever it's cloudy. I worked for the landlord for nine years, and when I returned home at the age of twenty-two, I was still a tenant farmer for the landlord. In 1943, when I was thirty years old, my hometown was liberated, and I was also liberated from the life of a beast of burden.

　　Last year, I participated in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and I was honored to meet Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government. Now, every time I shave, I remember how I hadn't shaved my head for six months when I was eleven years old; when I put on my octagonal cap, I remember the days when I was bareheaded; when I put on my uniform, I remember the ragged clothes I used to wear; when I put on my rubber shoes, I remember walking barefoot and freezing my feet in winter; I sleep on a blanket, and I remember sleeping on the bare ground in the past; …. The leaders are more enthusiastic to us working people than even our own brothers. It makes me deeply feel that the working people have become the masters of the country, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of the broad masses of the people. I will never forget my roots, and I will always follow the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

　　The Communist Party of China is the party of the working class. I want to learn from the older brothers and sisters of the working class and commemorate the Party's birthday with practical actions to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The peasants in Da'an Township, Feixian County, have discussed that to increase production, we need a lot of new farm tools, waterwheels, sprayers, etc., all of which need to be manufactured by our older brothers and sisters in the working class. We peasants must produce more grain and industrial raw materials, and work together with our older brothers and sisters in the working class to strive to consolidate national defense and build a strong new China. The government's rewards for our walking plow rice transplanter and nodding fertilizer applicator are of great help to us in increasing production. I thank the older brothers and sisters of the working class for their enthusiasm and help to us peasants. The older brothers and sisters of the working class have launched a patriotic labor competition, treating the factory as a battlefield, the machine as a weapon, improving technology, increasing production, and donating the increased income to airplanes and artillery to resist the United States and aid Korea. We peasants must cultivate meticulously, apply more fertilizer, carefully select seeds, soak seeds, and do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, strive to produce more grain, and donate airplanes and artillery. In addition, we are always ready to go wherever the motherland needs us most.

### 用巩固工农联盟的实际行动来纪念党的三十周年纪念日  农业劳动模范李瑞兰来信

　　用巩固工农联盟的实际行动来纪念党的三十周年纪念日
   农业劳动模范李瑞兰来信编辑同志：
    中国共产党三十周年纪念日快到了。在共产党、毛主席的领导下，我国劳动人民已经成为国家的主人，生活一天比一天好。中国人民的斗争已经取得伟大的胜利，并且还将继续取得更伟大的胜利。这些都是中国共产党正确领导的结果。
    我看看现在的好光景，很自然地回忆起过去不如牛马的痛苦日子。我十一岁那年，父亲去世了。家里没法生活，就把我七岁的二妹妹和四岁的三妹卖给地主，换了五十斤豆子。母亲、大妹妹、小弟弟和我四个人，就把这豆子合着树叶吃了三个多月。母亲和弟弟吃树叶吃得脸肿皮破，我的眼也肿得看不见东西了。讨饭都看不见门。我母亲一看这日子没法过，领着我大妹妹改嫁了。我小弟弟饿死了。家中孤苦零丁只剩下一个十一岁的我，提着棍子在外讨饭，每天吃不到三分饱。到十三岁，我给地主放猪。麦熟的时候，地主叫我和大人一样每天割麦子，我连割三天，没有休息，腰累伤了，现在每到阴天还疼。我给地主做了九年活，二十二岁回家，仍给地主当佃户。我三十岁那年（一九四三），我的家乡解放了，我也从牛马生活里解放出来。
    去年我参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，见了毛主席、朱总司令和中国共产党、中央人民政府的各位首长，我感到光荣。现在，我每在剃头刮脸时，就想起我十一岁那年，六个月没剃过头的样子；我带上八角帽，就想起过去光着头时的情形；我穿上制服，就想起过去穿的破衣服；我穿上胶鞋，就想起过去打赤脚，冬天把脚都冻破了。我睡觉时铺上毛毯，就想起过去睡着光地；……。首长们对我们劳动人民的热情，比亲弟兄还亲。使我深深感到：劳动人民已经做了国家的主人，共产党毛主席是广大人民的救星。我永远不能忘本，我要永远跟着中国共产党、毛主席走。
    中国共产党是工人阶级的政党。我要向工人老大哥学习，用巩固工农联盟的实际行动，来纪念党的生日。我们费县大安乡农民曾经讨论过：要提高生产，需要很多新的农具、水车、喷雾器等，这些都要工人老大哥制造。我们农民要多打粮食，多种工业原料，和工人老大哥一起，来为巩固国防、建设强大的新中国而努力。政府奖励我们的步犁拖米机、点头撒物器，对我们增加生产的帮助很大。我感谢工人老大哥对我们农民的热情和帮助。工人老大哥展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛，把工厂当战场，机器当刀枪，提高技术，增加生产，并且把增加的收入捐献飞机大炮，抗美援朝。我们农民要精耕细作，多使肥、认真选种、浸种，做好防治病虫害工作，争取多打粮食，捐献飞机大炮。此外，我们还随时准备着，到祖国最需要我们的地方去。
