　　Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Other Places搬运工人Voluntarily Stopped Using "Hand Hooks" to Reduce Losses of State Property During Transportation
    搬运工人in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, Chongqing, Shenyang and other places, in order to prevent the loss of state property and facilitate the exchange of materials, voluntarily stopped using "hand hooks," successfully resolving this problem that had been unresolved for decades.
    The use of "hand hooks" by stevedores when搬运工人packaging items was a bad habit left over from the feudal monopoly system. After liberation, although the political consciousness of搬运工人in various places was raised after opposing the feudal monopoly system, the problem of using "hand hooks" was still not completely resolved. The loss to state property from this was huge. According to a survey and statistics from a certain city in the Central South Region, the city's wharves and stations loaded and unloaded about 600 million jin of grain each year, using 3 million sacks. In the process of unloading from trucks to loading onto ships, each sack was hooked an average of at least 19 times. Adding up the depreciation cost of the sacks, the labor cost of repairing them, the cost of repairing materials, and the loss of grain leakage, each reduction in the use of three million sacks would save approximately 14 billion yuan. After this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political consciousness of the workers was further enhanced. In order to prevent the loss of state property, they voluntarily put forward the slogan "Stop Using Hand Hooks." At present,搬运工人in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Qingdao, Shenyang, Chongqing and other cities who originally used hand hooks have mostly abolished hand hooks. In Shanghai, among 266 large and medium-sized wharves, 14,963 people have abolished hand hooks, accounting for slightly less than 96 percent of the number of people using hand hooks. In order to solve the difficulty of loading and unloading goods after abolishing hand hooks, they have come up with new methods in technology and labor organization: such as leaving two large corners on the stitched opening to use as handles; the people who搭肩are not fixed, and after 搭肩three or fifty bags, they take turns to carry them. Therefore, the abolition of hand hooks not only reduces the country's losses, but also improves搬运工人efficiency.

　　北京天津上海等地搬运工人
    自动停止使用“手钩”  使国家财产在运输中减少损失
    北京、天津、上海、武汉、青岛、重庆、沈阳等地搬运工人，为了使国家财产不受损失，便于促进物资交流，特自动停止使用“手钩”，使这个几十年来不能解决的问题，顺利地得到解决。
    装卸工人搬运包装物品时使用“手钩”，是封建把持制度遗留下的一种恶习。解放后，各地搬运工人经过反封建把持制度后，政治觉悟虽然提高，但使用“手钩”的问题，仍然没有完全解决。这对国家资财的损失是巨大的。仅据中南区某城市的调查统计，该市各码头、车站每年装卸粮食约六亿斤，使用麻袋三百万条。由汽车卸下到装上轮船的过程中，每条麻袋至少平均要受钩伤十九处。把麻袋的折旧费、修补人工费、修补材料费及耗漏粮食的损失合计起来，每三百万条麻袋少用一次，就要损失约一百四十亿元。经过这次镇压反革命后，工人政治觉悟进一步提高。他们为了使国家财产不受损失，自动提出“停止使用手钩”的口号。目前北京、天津、武汉、青岛、沈阳、重庆等城市原来使用手钩的搬运工人，已大部把手钩废除。上海二百六十六个大、中码头上，废除手钩的有一万四千九百六十三人，占使用手钩人数百分之九十六弱。他们为了解决废除手钩后装卸货物的困难，在技术上和劳动组织上想出了新的办法：如缝口留两只大角做抓手；搭肩的人不固定，搭过三、五十包便轮流掮运。因此，废除手钩不仅减少了国家的损失，而且提高了搬运效率。
