	Popular Readings Welcomed by the Masses
	According to recent statistics from the Central South and Southwest (Sichuan North) regions, several popular readings are well-suited to the needs of the masses and have been particularly welcomed. The Central South People's Publishing House's "Farmer's Cultural Textbook" has published 4.47 million copies, "Women's Three Character Classic" has published 1.48 million copies, "Farmer's Miscellany" has published 460,000 copies, and the newly launched "Central South Farmer" bi-monthly has exceeded 50,000 copies per issue. The Wuhan Popular Bookstore's "Daily Use Characters for Workers and Peasants" and "New Daughter's Classic" each sold 100,000 copies within two months. The "Farmer's Three Character Classic" published by the Sichuan North People's Publishing House in the Southwest region printed 200,000 copies from January to mid-April this year, and the Nanchong City Wood Printing Industry reprinted more than 140,000 copies. Although it only temporarily met the needs of farmers in Nanchong City and its vicinity, it was still in short supply. These situations fully reflect the widespread enthusiasm of farmers for learning culture.

	The National Science Federation's Organ Journal "Natural Science"
	Since the First National Natural Science Workers Representative Conference in August last year, a great solidarity movement has been launched in the national science community. One concrete manifestation of this is that, in terms of scientific publications, the China Science Society merged its publication "Science," which had been published for 35 years, with the "Science World" published by the China Natural Science Society for 19 volumes. The merger was taken over by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and renamed "Natural Science." The main tasks of "Natural Science" are: (1) To strive to make natural science serve production and national defense construction, and to make theory serve practice; (2) To report on the development trends in the field of natural science and to introduce scientific knowledge related to national defense and production construction; (3) To introduce the achievements of Soviet science; (4) To publish abstracts of creative papers by the scientific community in our country; (5) To report on the work of scientific organizations and scientific publishing circles.

	The first issue of "Natural Science" has been published. This issue is a special edition on national defense science knowledge in response to the government's call to strengthen national defense forces. The journal is distributed by the China Book Company.

	Joint Publication of "Elementary School Summer Homework"
	Shanghai will soon publish a type of "Elementary School Summer Homework," which is jointly published by the New Children's Bookstore, the Commercial Press, and the Tonglian Bookstore. In view of the fact that many bookstores published many types of summer homework materials last year, which was not only repetitive and wasteful but also contained errors and inadequacies in content, the above-mentioned three bookstores overcame departmentalism this year, organized a joint publishing and supply organization, concentrated the strength of the three bookstores, and worked together in drafting, drawing, and printing, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and did a good job in publishing this year's elementary school summer homework. The entire book consists of eleven volumes, with an initial print run of one million copies, all of which will be exclusively distributed by the China Book Distribution Company.

	Points to Note Regarding the Compilation and Printing of the 1952 Almanac
	The almanac is an important tool for carrying out propaganda and education among the people. Last year, various places paid attention to the compilation, printing, and distribution of new almanacs, and achieved considerable propaganda effects. However, old almanacs containing feudal superstitions still have a non-negligible share nationwide. This situation must be changed. Recently, the General Administration of Publications has made a decision on the compilation, printing, and distribution of the 1952 almanac. The following is a summary of the decision regarding the compilation section: (1) The Beijing People's Publishing House is responsible for editing a new almanac in the nature of a political handbook for cadres. The paper format should be sent to various places by September of this year; and it is responsible for organizing the supply of materials related to the political part of the new lunar calendar for various places to adopt when compiling the new lunar calendar. This manuscript should be sent to various places within this month. The part of the new lunar calendar concerning production knowledge and hygiene common sense shall be edited by various places according to the specific situation. (2) The following methods are adopted for publishers of old almanacs: 1. Almanacs (including daily calendars, desk calendars, etc.) that do not involve political content and only talk about calendar phenomena can be freely published as long as there are no scientific errors; 2. Publishers of old almanacs, if they want to add political content to the almanac themselves (such as maxims, holiday explanations, etc.), the selection of materials must be serious and earnest.

	Two New Books on Land Reform
	"New Look of the Countryside After Land Reform" (published by the People's Publishing House in April this year, priced at Grade A, 4,300 yuan) collects 22 investigation and report texts on the countryside after land reform in the four administrative regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South, reflecting the improvement of farmers' productivity and purchasing power after land reform, and pointing out the changing face of rural life. Among them, "Survey of Rural Purchasing Power in Keshan County," "Investigation Report on Wuxiang Rural Areas in Shanxi," and "Overview of Rural Areas in Old Liberated Areas of North China After Land Reform" are all typical rural survey materials.

	The Central South People's Publishing House published a book "Experiences in Mobilizing the Masses in Land Reform" in April (priced at Grade B, 3,600 yuan). It compiles 23 summary reports on the experience of mobilizing the masses in the struggle for land reform in various provinces in the Central South region, explaining the methods and experiences of the Central South region in relying on poor and hired peasants, uniting middle peasants, mobilizing the masses, and launching struggles, which can be used as a reference for future land reform work.

	Books on Labor Insurance
	At present, many types of books on labor insurance have been published. Among them, the more complete one is "Labor Insurance Work Manual" Volume 1 (compiled by the Labor Insurance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, published by the Workers Publishing House, priced at 5,200 yuan). This book compiles relevant laws, documents, speeches, and papers on labor insurance, which can help readers gain a basic understanding of labor insurance. The "Introduction to Northeast Labor Protection Experience" published by the Shanghai Labor Publishing House (priced at 4,500 yuan) introduces the experience and achievements of the Northeast region in implementing the Provisional Regulations on Labor Insurance during wartime. The Workers Publishing House published a new book on labor insurance in May this year: "Labor Insurance Q&A," which is a very relevant book for the current needs. The book divides the 97 questions related to labor insurance into six categories, that is, the specific issues in the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations are categorized and answered concisely; these answers have been reviewed by the Central Labor Department and publicly published in the Workers' Daily.

	It is not good to abbreviate labor insurance as "Laobao". The Shanghai Labor Publishing House used this abbreviation in the title of the book and should correct it.

	"Problems of Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary School Education"
	The "Cultural and Educational Reference Materials Series" published by the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee has recently been reformed, mainly to give each issue a focus, so that the discussion of issues is more systematic and in-depth. The first series published after the reform is "Problems of Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary School Education" by Soviet author Kairov, translated by Wang Yijin. The original author is the Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Four articles in this book are reports he made at several education conferences from 1949 to 1951, which can help us learn the latest experience of Soviet primary and secondary school education. The book includes two decisions of the CPSU (B) Central Committee in 1931 and 1932 concerning primary and secondary school education, which are extremely valuable documents.

	Henan "Cultural and Educational Newsletter" Volume 2, Issues 3 and 4
	Henan's "Cultural and Educational Newsletter" bi-monthly Volume 2, Issues 3 and 4, successively provided a series of experiences and methods in implementing patriotic education in the teaching of history, geography, language, mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, child psychology, and vocational spare-time schools. Such systematic provision of patriotic education experience is helpful for general middle and primary school teachers to carry out patriotic education. Patriotic education should be carried out in teaching for a long time, widely and deeply. The efforts of Henan middle and primary school teachers and the Henan "Cultural and Educational Newsletter" bi-monthly in this regard should attract the attention and learning of teachers in various places and editors of educational journals.

	New Editions of Lu Xun's Works Published One After Another
	The single editions of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun" compiled by the Lu Xun Commemorative Committee and published by the Lu Xun Complete Works Publishing House are being printed by the East China People's Publishing House one after another. In April and May, "Letters Between Two Places," "Random Thoughts from North and South," "Two Hearts Collection," "Outside Collection," "Supplements to the Outside Collection," "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," "Wandering," "Huagai Collection," "Huagai Collection Continued," "Destruction," etc., have been published. The books all maintain their original format in terms of binding.

	Provincial Newspaper Review Work
	Provincial newspapers should pay attention to leading the work of local newspapers below the provincial level; establishing newspaper review work is an effective method of implementing this leadership. The Sunan Daily has already begun to publish newspaper reviews. The Shaanxi Daily once reviewed the work of the Nanzheng Newspaper in the newspaper review column. The Chuanbei Daily published a column titled "A Tour of Small Newspapers" on May 24, criticizing and introducing the work of four county-level small newspapers in the Chuanbei District. This spirit of paying attention to leading local newspapers is worth emulating.

	Mistakes of the Changzhou People's Daily
	On May 27, the Sunan Daily published an article criticizing the serious mistake of the "Changzhou People's Daily" in the district for publishing a letter defending counter-revolutionaries. The article criticized the Changzhou People's Daily for its mistakes of failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and losing its position in handling this incident, pointing out that the newspaper's staff did not realize that the people's newspaper is a weapon used by the people to exercise dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries, and there is no room for counter-revolutionaries to speak in the people's newspaper. Because the editors mistakenly regarded the political issue of the enemy's counterattack against the people as an ideological issue within the people, it caused the bad consequence of ideological confusion among some of the masses in propaganda. Finally, it emphasized that news workers must earnestly and seriously study the policies and decrees of the People's Government, so that the publication of each article must conform to the interests of the people.

	Comics in Newspapers
	On May 26, the Jiefang Daily (this city edition) published an article "Comics - A Powerful Weapon for Carrying out the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Propaganda," analyzing the situation and experience of Shanghai newspapers using comics to carry out the suppression of counter-revolutionary propaganda. The article stated that among the 11 public and private newspapers published in Shanghai, including Jiefang Daily, Xinwen Daily, Wenhui Daily, Dagong Daily, Labor Daily, Youth Daily, Shanghai Suburban Farmers Daily, and New Children's Daily, from April 1 to May 15, they successively published 28 sets of comics with the theme of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. These paintings have played a certain role in helping the people understand the crimes of counter-revolutionaries and educating the masses on how to assist the government in doing a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The author pointed out that according to some characteristics of news comics themselves, the following three issues should be paid attention to in drawing comics: 1. Attention should be paid to the authenticity of the subject matter and the correctness of the policy; 2. The characters must be as realistic as possible in their images; 3. The description font should be large, and the sentences should be simple and fluent. It would be better if they could be compiled into clappers according to the spoken language of the masses.

　　出版动态
    受到广大群众欢迎的通俗读物
    根据最近我们收到的中南区和西南区川北送来的统计资料，有几种通俗读物适合群众需要，特别受到欢迎。中南人民出版社的《农民文化课本》已出版四百四十七万册，《妇女三字经》已出版一百四十八万册，《农民杂字》已出版四十六万册，创刊不久的《中南农民》半月刊每期销数也已超过五万份。武汉通俗图书出版社的《工农日用杂字》和《新女儿经》，两个月内各销了十万册。西南区川北人民出版社出版的《农民三字经》本年一月至四月中，印了二十万册，又由南充市木刊业翻印了十四万余册，虽然暂时只供给了南充市和它附近农民的需要，还是供不应求。这些情况充分反映了农民普遍地要求学习文化的热情。
            全国科联的机关刊物《自然科学》
    从去年八月中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表会议。会议后，全国科学界展开了大团结运动，具体表现之一：在科学刊物方面，中国科学社把它出版了三十五年的刊物《科学》和中华自然科学社出版了十九卷的《科学世界》合并，由全国自然科学专门学会联合会接办，定名为《自然科学》。《自然科学》的主要任务是：（一）努力使自然科学为生产和国防建设服务，使理论为实践服务；（二）报道自然科学领域发展的趋向，介绍有关国防和生产建设的科学知识；（三）介绍苏联科学的成就；（四）发表我国科学界创作论文的提要；（五）报道科学团体和科学出版界的工作。
    《自然科学》第一期已出版，这一期是配合政府加强国防力量的号召的国防科学知识特辑。该刊由中国图书公司总经售。
            《小学暑假作业》的联合出版
    上海最近将出版一种《小学暑假作业》，这是由新儿童书店、商务印书馆和童联书店联合出版的。鉴于去年度出版暑假作业教材的有许多家、许多种，不仅重复浪费，而且内容方面也有错误和欠妥之处。本年度上述三家书店克服了本位主义，组织了联合出版的供应机构，集中三家力量，在组稿、绘制、印刷各方面，舍短取长，分工合作，做好了本年度小学暑假作业的出版工作。全书共十一册，初版印一百万册，全部交专营发行的中国图书发行公司总经售。
            关于编印一九五二年历书的应注意事项
    历书是一种向人民进行宣传教育的重要工具。去年各地曾注意到新历书的编印与发行工作，获得了相当的宣传效果。但含有封建迷信的旧历书，在全国范围内，还有不可忽视的份量。这种情况必须改变。最近出版总署对一九五二年历书的编印发行已作了决定，下面是决定中关于编印部分的摘要：（一）北京人民出版社负责编辑一种供干部用的政治手册性质的新历书，纸型应于本年九月内寄达各地；并负责组织新农历中有关政治部分的材料供给各地编印新农历时采用，此项稿件应于本月内寄达各地。新农历中关于生产知识及卫生常识部分，由各地根据具体情况自行编辑。（二）对于旧历书的出版者，采取如下的办法：一、不涉及政治内容而只讲历象的历书（包括日历、台历等）只要没有科学上的错误，可以自由出版；二、旧历书出版者，如要在历书中自行增加政治内容（如格言、节日解释等）时，选材必须严肃认真。
            两本关于土地改革的新书籍
    “土改后的农村新气象”（人民出版社本年四月出版，定价甲，四三○○元）收集了东北、华北、华东、中南等四个行政区中关于土地改革后农村的调查和报道文字二十二篇，反映了土地改革后农民生产力与购买力的提高，指出了一切都在变化着的农村生活的面貌。其中“克山县农村购买力调查”、“山西武乡农村考察报告”、“土地改革后华北老区农村的概况”都是富有典型性的农村调查材料。
    中南人民出版社四月份出版了一本“土地改革中发动群众的经验”（定价乙，三六○○元）。它汇集了中南区各省在土地改革斗争中发动群众的经验的总结性报告二十三篇，说明了中南区在依靠贫雇农、团结中农、发动群众、展开斗争等方面的方法和经验，可供今后土地改革工作的参考。
            有关劳动保险的书籍
    目前有关劳动保险的书籍已经出了不少种，其中比较完整的要推“劳动保险工作手册”第一辑（中华全国总工会劳动保险部编、工人出版社出版，定价五二○○元）。这本书汇集了有关劳动保险的法令、文件、讲话和论文，可以帮助读者对劳动保险获得基本认识。上海劳动出版社出版的“东北劳保经验介绍”（定价四五○○元）介绍了东北地区实行战时暂行劳动保险条例的经验和成绩。工人出版社在本年五月出版了一本有关劳动保险的新书：“劳动保险问答”，这是一本很切合目前需要的书。书中把有关劳动保险的九十七个问题分列为六个项目，也就是把劳动保险条例在实施中的一些具体问题分门别类，作了简明扼要的解答；这些解答都曾经中央劳动部审核、由工人日报公开发表的。
    把劳动保险简称为“劳保”是不好的。上海劳动出版社在书名上用了这简称，应当改正。
            “提高中小学教育质量问题”
    政务院文化教育委员会出版的《文教参考资料丛刊》，最近实行革新，主要是使每一期的内容有一个重心，以便问题的探讨更有系统和更加深入。革新后出版的第一本丛刊，是苏联卡伊洛夫著、王易今译的“提高中小学教育质量问题”。原作者是俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国教育部长，本书中有四篇文章是他在一九四九——一九五一年间的几个教育会议上的报告，可帮助我们学习苏联中小学教育的最近的经验。书后附录联共（布）中央一九三一和一九三二年的有关中小学教育的两个决定，是极有价值的文件。
            河南《文教通讯》二卷三、四期
    河南《文教通讯》半月刊二卷三期和四期连续提供了在历史、地理、语文、数学、化学、物理、生物、儿童心理等课程以及职工业余学校教学中一系列的贯彻爱国主义教育的经验和方法。这样系统地提供爱国主义教学的经验，对于一般中、小学教员进行爱国主义教育是有帮助的。爱国主义教育应该长期地、广泛地、深入地在教学中进行下去，河南中、小学教员和河南《文教通讯》半月刊在这方面的努力，应该引起各地教员和教育类期刊的编辑工作者的重视和学习。
            鲁迅著作单行本新版本陆续出版
    鲁迅先生纪念委员会编纂、鲁迅全集出版社出版的《鲁迅全集》单行本，正由华东人民出版社陆续印行中。在四、五两月份内已出版的有《两地书》、《南腔北调集》、《二心集》、《集外集》、《集外集拾遗》、《朝花夕拾》、《彷徨》《华盖集》、《华盖集续编》、《毁灭》等。各书在装帧上都保持了原先的形式。
            省级报纸述评工作
    省级的报纸应该注意领导省以下的地方报纸的工作；建立报纸述评工作，就是实行这种领导的有效的方法。苏南日报已经开始发表报纸述评。陕西日报曾在报纸述评栏中评述了南郑报的工作。川北日报五月二十四日发表了以“小报巡礼”为题的专栏，批评和介绍了川北区四种县级小报的工作。像这种注意领导地方报纸的精神，是值得效法的。
            常州民报的错误
    五月二十七日，苏南日报发表了一篇批评该区“常州民报”发表为反革命分子狡辩的信件的严重错误的文章。该文批评了常州民报在处理这一事件中敌我不分、丧失立场的错误，指出该报的工作人员没有认识人民的报纸是人民用来向反革命分子进行专政的一种武器，在人民报纸上，根本没有反革命分子说话的余地。由于编者把敌人向人民进行反攻的政治问题错误地认为人民内部的思想问题，以致造成宣传上使部分群众思想混乱的恶劣后果。最后强调地指出：新闻工作者必须认真严肃地学习人民政府的政策法令，使每篇文章的发表都必须符合人民的利益。
            报纸上的连环画
    五月二十六日解放日报（本市版）发表了“连环画——开展镇压反革命宣传的有力武器”一文，分析了上海各报以连环画的形式进行镇压反革命宣传的情况和经验，文中说明，在上海市出版的十一家公、私营报纸中，有解放日报、新闻日报、文汇报、大公报、劳动报、青年报、沪郊农民报和新少年报等，从四月一日到五月十五日止，先后刊出以镇压反革命为题材的连环画二十八套，这些画在帮助人民群众认识反革命分子罪行，教育群众怎样协助政府做好镇压反革命工作等方面都起了一定作用。作者指出：根据新闻连环画本身的一些特点，在绘制连环画中应注意以下三个问题：一、应该注意题材的真实性和政策的正确性；二、在人物形象上必须力求逼真；三、说明字体要大，文句通俗流畅，如能按照群众的口语编成快板就更好。
