　　Correcting the Shortcoming of Only Emphasizing the Supply of Living Materials
    Cooperatives in Various Parts of Northeast China Pay Attention to Supplying Various Means of Production
    Cooperatives in Yutai and Wen Counties, Pingyuan Province, Timely Supply Members with Agricultural Tools for Wheat Harvesting and Summer Planting
    Cooperatives in various parts of Northeast China are implementing the principle of serving their members and vigorously supplying them with means of production. According to statistics from 70% of the counties in the region, cooperatives supplied members with 138 kinds of means of production for spring plowing in the first quarter, with a total value of 88 billion yuan (RMB); the supply volume exceeded 80% of the region's total supply for the entire last year. Among the means of production supplied in the first quarter of this year, there were high-quality seeds sufficient to sow 2,133,000 mu of land, and fertilizers sufficient to fertilize 475,000 mu of special crops; in addition, there were more than 1,116,000 pieces of farm tools, more than 2,377,000 jin of pesticides, and more than 6,000 head of draft animals.
    After the land reform, farmers in Northeast China have seen a yearly increase in their need for means of production; however, in the past, most cooperatives only emphasized the supply of living materials and neglected meeting the production needs of their members. In 1950, the means of production supplied by cooperatives to farmers in the entire Northeast region only accounted for 1.5% of the total retail sales. This year, Northeast cooperatives, while rectifying their business operations and implementing the principle of serving their members, began to correct this shortcoming. In the first quarter, cooperative societies in various provinces regarded the supply of means of production for spring plowing as their primary task. Before and after the Spring Festival, cooperative societies in various places investigated the types, quantities, and specifications of items needed by members for spring plowing, and formulated plans for purchasing and procuring means of production based on this. Before purchasing means of production, most cooperative societies in Liaodong Province also convened symposiums with experts in draft animals and farm tools to determine the standards for the quality and price of the items. The Liudaojiang District Cooperative Society in Linjiang County, the province, first made samples of farm tools, and after the members deemed them suitable for use, they signed ordering contracts with blacksmiths according to the samples. In order to facilitate the preparation of various means of production, cooperative societies at all levels in the provinces had a clear division of labor. For example, village-level cooperative societies in Heilongjiang Province were responsible for exchanging high-quality seeds nearby, county-level cooperative societies were responsible for procuring farm tools, and large-scale means of production that needed to be purchased from other provinces were handled by the provincial cooperative societies.
    In addition to purchasing and organizing processing and ordering, conducting short-distance material exchanges between regions is another important method for cooperative societies in various parts of Northeast China to solve the problem of the source of means of production for spring plowing. Seeds, which accounted for 41% of the supply of means of production in the first quarter, were mostly resolved through exchanges between counties, districts, and villages. Cooperative societies in the mountainous areas of Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, used manure baskets and wooden rollers to exchange for sorghum seeds from the plain areas, which not only supplied means of production but also promoted the sale of sideline products for members. In Rehe Province, where transportation is inconvenient, members obtained means of production worth 6.8 billion yuan due to the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies between cooperative societies in various counties.
    In supplying means of production, cooperative societies in various places also tried every possible way to save money for their members, relatively increasing their purchasing power. For example, the Dongfeng County Cooperative Society in Liaodong Province adopted the method of purchasing scrap iron to process and manufacture farm tools when supplying farm tools, saving a lot of money for its members. The Jin County Cooperative Society in the Lushun-Dalian area tried its best to reduce the circulation links of commodities and directly purchased bean cakes from other places, saving more than 50 million yuan for its members. In addition to stipulating that members could exchange grain for high-quality seeds, cooperative societies in various places actively solved the difficulty of members lacking cash. The Shuangcheng County Cooperative Society in Songjiang Province reached an agreement with the grain company to purchase 1,000 tons of soybeans on credit from its members; members could use the credit purchase vouchers to exchange for the means of production they needed at the cooperative society. The Xinzheng Village Cooperative Society in Shangzhi County, the province, allowed members who lacked cash to exchange scrap iron for ploughshares. Cooperative societies with credit departments in various parts of Jilin Province actively used credit to help poor members, enabling them to purchase seeds and vehicles. (Xinhua News Agency)
    In order to meet the needs of members for wheat harvesting and summer planting, the Yutai and Wen County Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Pingyuan Province supplied a large number of farm tools to their members at low prices. The Yutai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative began in March to conduct statistics through village cooperative societies, and after inspection by branch societies, ordered a large number of farm tools according to the types and quantities needed by the members. At present, during the period of food shortage, in order to take care of the difficulty of members not having cash to buy, they are supplied to members in the form of low-price loans. From May 5th to May 24th, 9,100 brooms, 10,000 sickles, 1,000 pockets, 10 carts, and 50 head of livestock have been loaned out. The Wen County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 3,580 pieces of large and small farm tools such as forks, brooms, plowshares, plowshares, and whetstones in mid-March, and organized ironsmiths and carpenters to repair and newly make more than 2,300 pieces of farm tools, all of which have been loaned to the members. In terms of lending methods, all have adopted the method of pre-ordering contracts. In Yutai, the method of gradually counting contracts between natural villages and village cooperatives, and between village cooperatives and branch cooperatives, is adopted in the ordering contracts. In Wen County, after buying the farm tools in advance, they organized visits at the cadre meeting of the expanded village cooperative society, which facilitated the purchase of farm tools by the members. The timely supply of farm tools by the cooperative society and the low prices have been supported by the majority of members. Many farmers have requested to join the cooperative society. In the second district of Yutai, more than 3,000 members have been added through pre-wheat business supply.
    The Yutai and Wen County Supply and Marketing Cooperatives mostly adopt the method of selling on credit and lending in the methods of promoting farm tools, which will accumulate cooperative funds. This method is not good. We should try to adopt the method of distributing and selling for cash as much as possible. If the funds for purchasing and manufacturing these farm tools are loaned by the bank through the cooperative society, that would be acceptable. (Reprinted from Pingyuan Daily)

　　纠正只重视供应生活资料的缺点
    东北各地合作社注意供应各种生产资料
    平原省鱼台、温县合作社及时供应社员麦收夏种农具
    东北各地合作社贯彻为社员服务的方针，大力供应社员生产资料。据全区百分之七十的县份统计，合作社在第一季度供应社员春耕用的生产资料有一百三十八种，总值达八百八十亿元（人民币，下同）；供应量超过全区去年全年供应量的百分之八十。今年第一季度供应的生产资料中，有可以播种二百十三万三千亩地的优良籽种，和可以施肥四十七万五千亩特种作物的肥料；另外还有一百十一万六千多件农具，二百三十七万七千多斤农药和六千多头耕畜。
    东北区农民在土地改革后，对生产资料的需要逐年增加；可是过去一般合作社只重视生活资料的供应而忽视满足社员生产上的需要。一九五○年全区合作社供给农民的生产资料，只占全部零售额的百分之一点五。今年东北合作社在整顿业务，贯彻为社员服务的方针时，开始纠正这一缺点。各省合作社在第一季度把供应社员春耕生产资料作为首要任务。春节前后，各地合作社都调查了社员春耕中所需物品的种类、数量与规格，并且以此为根据，制定了购办生产资料的计划。辽东省大部合作社购办生产资料前，还召开了耕畜、农具的行家座谈会，定出物品的质量与价格的标准。该省临江县六道江区合作社，先做出农具的样品，社员认为合适可用后，再依样与铁匠订立定货合同。各省各级合作社为便于准备各种生产资料起见，相互间都有明确分工。如黑龙江省各村级合作社负责就近串换优良籽种，各县级合作社负责置办农具，需要到外省采购的大宗生产资料由省合作社办理。
    除采购与组织加工、订货外，地区间进行短距离的物资交换，是东北各地合作社解决春耕生产资料来源问题的另一个重要办法。占第一季度生产资料供应量百分之四十一的籽种，绝大部分是以县、区、村间的串换方式解决的。辽东省海城县山区的合作社，用粪筐、木滚子交换平原地区的高粱种籽，不但供应了生产资料，还为社员推销了副业产品。对外交通不便的热河省，由于各县合作社间调剂有无，社员获得了价值六十八亿元的生产资料。
    在供应生产资料中，各地合作社还多方设法替社员省钱，相对地提高了社员的购买力。如辽东省东丰县合作社在供应农具中采用了收购废铁来加工制造农具的办法，为社员省了不少钱。旅大区金县合作社尽量减少商品的流转环节，直接去外地采购豆饼，为社员节省了五千多万元。各地合作社除规定社员可以粮食交换优良籽种外，并积极解决社员缺少现款的困难。松江省双城县合作社与粮食公司取得协议，赊购了社员一千吨大豆；社员凭赊购票就可以到合作社换得他们需要的生产资料。该省尚志县新政村合作社允许缺少现款的社员用废铁换铧子。吉林省各地有信贷部的合作社，积极用信贷帮助贫苦社员，使他们能购办种籽和车马。（新华社）
    平原省鱼台、温县供销合作社为满足社员麦收夏种需要，低价供给社员大批农具。鱼台县供销社于三月份开始，即通过村合作社普遍进行统计，经过分社检查，按照社员需要的品种及数量，订购了大批农具。目前正值青黄不接，为照顾社员没有现钱购买的困难，即以低价贷售方式供给社员。从五月五日开始，截至二十四日，已贷出扫帚九千一百把，镰刀一万张，口袋一千条，大车十辆，牲口五十头。温县供销社于三月中旬即购到杈、扫帚、犁面、犁铧、磨镰石等大小农具三千五百八十余件，并组织铁木匠修补及新打农具二千三百余件，这些农具已全部贷到社员手中。贷放方式上，皆采取了预先订合同的办法。鱼台在订合同中，采取自然村与村社订合同，村社与分社订合同的逐级统计办法。温县事前把农具买到后，在扩大村合作社干部会议上组织参观，便利了社员选购。合作社供应农具及时，且价格低廉，受到广大社员的拥护。很多农民纷纷要求入社。鱼台二区全区，通过麦前业务供应，即增加社员三千余名。
    鱼台、温县供销社在推销农具的方法上，多采取赊售贷放办法，这会积压合作社资金，这种办法是不好的。应尽量采取配售现购的办法。如果这种购、制农具的款项是银行通过合作社贷放的，那倒是可以的。（转载平原日报）
