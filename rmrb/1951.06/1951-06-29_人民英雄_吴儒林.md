　　People's Hero - Wu Rulin
      Liu Shiping
    After you visit many meritorious individuals and heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, you will come to a conclusion: although the deeds of each meritorious person and hero are different, when they fight to the most difficult point, they always think of the Party, think of Chairman Mao, think of the motherland, and think of the people of the motherland. In their pledges, they write: "I am a Communist Party member, I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, I can only eliminate the enemy, I cannot become a prisoner of the enemy." Even if they fight to the last person and the last bullet, even if they are injured, they still insist on staying on the front line, ensuring in battle that "as long as I am here, the position is here."
    Comrade Wu Rulin, a twenty-six-year-old machine gunner in the fourth squad of the second platoon of the eighth company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, demonstrates the noble qualities of the people's soldiers through his heroic battles. During the Fourth Battle, when the entire line south of the Han River was blocking the enemy from advancing north, their squad was stationed at the forward position of Baitongli, south of the Han River, blocking the enemy from attacking Longtouli from the right flank. They entered the position on Height 226.6 in Baitongli on February 19th. Based on the experience of fighting the American aggressors, "digging good fortifications is victory." He was the fastest soldier in the entire company at digging fortifications. He only took three hours, before dawn, to help the entire squad complete the fortifications.

    The fighting started on February 20th. The American aggressor army's 1st Cavalry Division first attacked their position three times with a company of soldiers under the cover of eight tanks, but they were all repelled. He and two ammunition carriers, wielding a light machine gun, coordinated with the entire squad's firepower, killing or wounding more than forty enemies. His light machine gun was always the most powerful. Because he usually cherished his weapon the most. When he had nothing to do, he always wiped the gun until it was shiny and scrubbed the grease on the bolt until it was spotless. He often remembered what the leadership had told him: "Hitting the enemy with blood all over your hands is not as painful as chopping off one of their fingers." Therefore, he was always very attentive when practicing shooting, and each bullet could hit five rings or more. Once, five bullets hit twenty-eight rings. Thus, he became a famous shooter in the eighth company.

    Based on the combat experience of the previous day, he offered the comrades in the whole squad advice, "Don't lose the position, be sure to build the fortifications well." So after his fortification was built, he helped other comrades repair their fortifications.

    When the enemy attacked the next day, they increased their forces to a battalion, first bombing and strafing with airplanes, and then bombarding the position with artillery. The enemy still followed the old pattern, waiting for the planes and artillery to finish bombing and bombarding before the infantry came up. His flexible machine gun cooperated with the entire squad's firepower again, repelling the enemy's attack.

    The battle continued for five days. On the twenty-fourth, the enemy's attack became even more frantic, with forces increasing to two battalions, more than a thousand men, continuously charging three times under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Wu Rulin held his ground, not having eaten for two days. Finally, his position was destroyed, the machine gun was broken, and the last bullet that was loaded but not fired popped out of the spring and fell in front of him. His left leg was broken, and his right leg was also injured. Battalion Political Officer He Chaoqing, Deputy Platoon Leader of the Second Platoon Feng Yangui and other comrades were all killed, leaving only him. His injuries were very serious, and he couldn't even stand up. His ammunition was exhausted, and he saw the heads of the enemies wriggling, about to rush up the mountain. He endured the pain, gritted his teeth, and quickly crawled around on the position, picking up more than thirty grenades that his comrades had not finished using. He crawled to the top of the mountain, and when the enemies rushed up, he threw the grenades down one after another, thwarting another enemy attack.

    In the five-day blocking battle, he annihilated more than a hundred enemies.

    When the gunfire stopped, Comrade Wu Rulin thought: "When I joined the Party, I swore that I would be tested in struggle, strive to become a formal Party member from a probationary member on the front line, and do everything to eliminate the enemy." Moreover, when entering this position, he had guaranteed to the instructor: "As long as I am here, the position is here. I must never become a prisoner of the enemy." So he used a stone to smash the last unfired bullet into his forehead, two-thirds of the bullet went in, and he passed out.

    The Deputy Platoon Leader of the First Platoon came up with the Second Squad as reinforcements, blocking the enemy's attack. When Wu Rulin regained consciousness, he asked his comrades for a gun to continue fighting. The Deputy Platoon Leader hurriedly went up to bandage the wounds on his legs and told the soldiers to quickly carry him down. He firmly refused, insisting on a "light machine gun." He fainted and woke up again, woke up and fainted again. Everyone persuaded him to go down, but he still said: "As long as I, Wu Rulin, have a breath, I will not leave the front line."

    All the comrades in the Second Squad wrote a guarantee, promising him: "We will definitely avenge you, and we will definitely eliminate the enemy before your eyes to be worthy of you."

    Finally, they wrapped him in a quilt, and two comrades carried him, slowly sliding down the snow-covered mountain, to the battalion aid station in Baitongli.

    At the aid station, he was still in a semi-conscious state, shouting: "Give me a light machine gun, I want to go back up." The medic wanted to carry him on a stretcher. He insisted: "My mission is not completed, I want to go back up, I have not completely eliminated the enemy." He would not let the medic carry him.

    The battalion instructor, medics, cooks, and cultural officers repeatedly comforted and persuaded him. After the stretcher was lifted, he still said: "I'm not going to the rear, I want to get well here."

    During the transportation, this outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party, the good soldier of the people, Comrade Wu Rulin, finally sacrificed for the motherland.

    The Party Committee of the regiment posthumously recognized him as a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party and promoted him to squad leader. The Party Committee of the division gave him the glorious title of "People's Hero."

    Comrade Wu Rulin has sacrificed. But the spirit of Comrade Wu Rulin has not died. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army are engaging in a desperate struggle with the enemy with this great national integrity of the Chinese nation and the noble qualities of the proletariat.

　　人民英雄——吴儒林
      刘时平
    当你访问过中国人民志愿军的许许多多的功臣和英雄后，你就会得出一个结论，尽管每一个功臣、英雄的事迹各有不同，但是当他们战斗到最艰苦的时候，总是想着党，想着毛主席，想着祖国，想着祖国的人民，他们在决心书上写下：“我是共产党员，我是中国人民志愿军的战士，只能消灭敌人，不能给敌人当俘虏。”他们那怕是战斗到最后一个人，最后一颗子弹，受伤了还是坚持不下火线，在战斗中，保证“只要有我在，就有阵地在。”
    吴儒林同志，这一个二十六岁的志愿军某部八连二排四班的机枪射手，从他的英勇战斗中，可以看得出人民战士的高贵品质。在第四次战役中，在汉江南岸全线阻击敌人北犯时，他们班在汉江南岸的白冬里坚守前沿阵地，阻击敌人由右翼向龙头里侧攻。他们是二月十九日进入白冬里的二二六点六高地的阵地的。根据和美国侵略军作战的经验，“挖好工事就是胜利”，他是全连挖工事最快的一个战士。他仅用了三小时的时间，在天亮以前，帮助全班把工事挖成。
    二月二十日就打响了。美国侵略军骑兵第一师，先以一连兵力在八辆坦克掩护下，向他们阵地反复攻了三次，都被他们打退了。他和两个弹药手掌握的一挺轻机关枪，配合全班的火力，杀伤了敌人四十余名。他的轻机枪一向是火力最强的。因为他平常最爱护武器，没有事的时候，总是把枪擦得亮晶晶的，把枪栓上的油渍洗刷得干干净净。他时常记住领导上对他说的一句话：“把敌人打成满手血，不如剁敌人一个手指痛”，所以他在平常练习打靶的时候总是很用心，每发子弹可以打中五环以上。有一次，五发子弹打中了二十八环。因此他成为八连的一个出名的射手。
    根据前一天的战斗经验，他向全班同志们提出意见，“不丢阵地，一定要好好修工事。”因此他的工事筑好了，再帮助其他同志修工事。
    第二天敌人进攻时，增加到一营的兵力，先以飞机轰炸扫射，再用大炮向阵地乱轰。敌人仍然是老规律，等飞机、大炮炸完、轰完，步兵上来了，他的那挺灵活的机关枪又配合全班火力，打退了敌人的进攻。
    战斗连续进行了五天，在二十四日那一天，敌人的进攻更加疯狂了，兵力增加到两个营，有一千余人，在飞机、大炮与坦克的掩护下，连续冲了三次。吴儒林坚守着阵地，两天没有吃饭。最后他的阵地被打塌，机枪打断了，上了膛没有打出去的最后一颗子弹，从弹簧中蹦出来，掉在他的面前。他的左腿被打断，右腿也负了伤。营政治干事何超清，二排副排长冯燕贵和其他的战友都牺牲了，只剩下他一个人。他的伤很重，站都站不起来，当时他的弹药也打光了，眼看敌人的脑袋蠕动，就要冲上山头来了。他忍痛咬紧牙关，赶紧在阵地上爬来爬去，把战友们没有打完的手榴弹捡了三十多个，爬到山顶上，等敌人往上冲时，一个接一个把手榴弹扔了下去，打垮了敌人又一次进攻。
    他在五天的阻击战中，歼灭了敌人百余名。
    吴儒林同志在枪声停息的时候想：“入党时，自己曾宣誓过：要在斗争中考验，争取在火线上由候补党员转为正式党员，一切为了消灭敌人。”而且在这次进入阵地时，自己曾向指导员提出保证：“有我在，就有阵地。怎样也不能当敌人的俘虏。”于是他把最后一颗没有出膛的子弹用石头向前额砸了进去，子弹钉进去三分之二，人也昏过去了。
    一排排副带着二班上来增援，堵击了敌人的进攻。吴儒林在神志清醒过来时，就跟同志要枪，要继续坚持战斗。一排副赶忙上去给他包扎两条腿上的伤，让战士们赶快把他抬下去。他坚决不肯，硬要“轻机关枪”。他晕过去又醒过来，醒过来又晕过去，大家劝他下去，他还是说：“只要我吴儒林有一口气，也不下火线。”
    二班全体同志写了保证书，向他保证：“我们一定替你报仇，一定把敌人消灭在你的眼前，才算对得起你。”
    最后，用被子把他包起来，两个同志抬着他，从雪山上，慢慢地滑下去，抬到白冬里营的救护站。
    在救护站，他还是在半昏迷状态中叫着：“给我轻机枪，我还要上去。”卫生员要用担架抬他。他坚持说：“我的任务没完成，我还要上去，我没有把敌人完全消灭。”不让卫生员抬他。
    营指导员、卫生员、炊事员、文化干事一再安慰和劝他。在担架抬起来以后，他还说：“我不到后面去，我要在这里治好。”
    在运送途中，这个中国共产党的优秀党员，人民的好战士吴儒林同志终于为祖国牺牲了。
    团党委追认他为中国共产党的正式党员，晋级为班长。师党委给他以“人民英雄”的光荣称号。
    吴儒林同志牺牲了。但是吴儒林同志的精神没有死，志愿军的战士们正以这种中华民族的伟大气节和无产阶级的高贵品质，和敌人进行决死的斗争。
