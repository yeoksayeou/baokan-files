　　The head of the Chinese People's Delegation, Shen Junru, then delivered a speech, which was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause. He first mentioned the long-standing traditional friendship between the people of China and Germany, and that this friendship had now entered a new chapter in the history of the two countries due to the establishment of the two new republics and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He said, "The founding of New China dealt a fatal blow to the imperialist plot in the Far East. At the same time, the founding of the German Democratic Republic and its friendly coexistence with the peace-loving Soviet Union will inevitably lead to the failure of the imperialist plot to launch a new war in Europe." He concluded, "Our two countries, China and Germany, stand united at the forefront of the peace camp. The German people can regard the victory of the Chinese people as their own victory and the victory of the world peace camp. The Chinese people also regard the victory of the German people in the struggle for unity and peace as their own victory."

　　After listing the great achievements of the construction work in China and Germany, Shen Junru spoke about the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea among the Chinese people. He said, "The Chinese and Korean people fought side by side and gave the American aggressors a serious blow." This remark won warm applause.

　　Shen Junru condemned the American imperialists for rearming Japan and West Germany, and announced that 230 million people in China had signed the Berlin Resolution of the World Peace Council. This news caused great excitement among the audience.

　　The conference concluded with a cultural performance. The Free German Youth League choir sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, as well as songs such as "The People of the World Unite Tightly" and "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers."

　　All the democratic newspapers in Berlin prominently published the news of the Sino-German Friendship Month on their front pages on the 9th. Some of the headlines in the newspapers were: "The Victorious Chinese People Are Our Friends" and "Learn from the Heroic Chinese People." In the past few days, more than one million viewers in both East and West Berlin have watched the Chinese film "Daughters of China".

　　沈钧儒致词赞扬中德人民胜利
　　并指出：民主德国与苏联友好，将使帝国主义在欧洲发动战争的阴谋必败。
    中国人民代表团团长沈钧儒接着致词，他的讲话屡屡被狂热的掌声所打断。他首先提到中德两国人民间多年的传统友谊，而由于两个新共和国的成立以及两国间外交关系的建立，这种友谊现在已进入两国历史中新的一章。他说：“新中国的成立使帝国主义在远东的阴谋遭到致命的打击，同时，德意志民主共和国的成立以及它与爱好和平的苏联的友好共处，将使帝国主义在欧洲发动新战争的阴谋必然归于失败。”他最后说：“我们中德两国团结一致站在和平阵营的前列。德国人民可以把中国人民的胜利看做是他们自己的胜利和世界和平阵营的胜利，中国人民也把德国人民在争取统一与和平的斗争中取得的胜利看做是他们自己的胜利。”
    在列举了中德两国建设工作的伟大成就之后，沈钧儒谈到中国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动。他说：“中朝人民并肩作战，给了美国侵略者以严重的打击。”他这话博得了热烈的掌声。
    沈钧儒谴责美帝国主义者重新武装日本和西德，并宣布中国已有二亿三千万人在世界和平理事会的柏林决议上签了名。这消息在会众中引起了很大的兴奋。
    大会最后演出文艺节目，自由德国青年联盟合唱团用中文演唱《东方红》，并演唱了《全世界人民团结紧》及《中国人民志愿军战歌》等歌曲。
    柏林所有民主报纸在九日都用首页地位醒目地刊登德中友好月的消息。各报的标题中有：“胜利的中国人民是我们的朋友”，“向英雄的中国人民学习”。过去几天内，柏林东西两区看过中国影片《中华女儿》的观众在一百万人以上。
