The Party Inspires Us to Advance Victoriously!
Letters from Volunteer Army Combat Heroes Zhou Wenjiang and Guo Zhongtian to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

The Party's birthday, "July 1st," is approaching. At this moment, I—a battalion chief of staff, battalion party committee member, and combat hero in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—have returned to the motherland from the Korean front and to Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, because I was selected to participate in the upcoming Third World Youth and Students for Peace Festival in Berlin, Germany. Today, I want to report to you on our combat situation with the US imperialist aggressor army in Korea over the past six months and our future resolutions.

The leaders of the Volunteer Army and the higher-level Party Committee of the Communist Party of China care very much about me and our troops. When I was still the political instructor of the Fifth Company, the division and regimental leaders often came to our company to participate in various meetings and often talked to me; they educated and trained me in various ways so that I would know how to command troops and defeat the enemy in actual combat and become a glorious combat hero.

Under the leadership of the higher-level Party Committee, our troops, especially the Communist Party branch of the Fifth Company, played a strong fortress role in combat, marching, and other aspects. Communist Party members often led all the soldiers to complete various arduous tasks with their heroic combat and hard-working exemplary actions. In the defense of Height 1376 in the Hamnam Campaign, the enemy attacked the company's position in shifts with a force of four or five hundred people, combined with more than twenty aircraft, four or five tanks, and dozens of cannons. On the first day of the battle, Comrade Liu Shengzuo, the youth committee member of the branch, led a squad to repel three or four frenzied counterattacks by the enemy and wiped out more than sixty enemies. Yan Zhiqiang, the machine gun group leader and a Communist Party member, had unfortunately injured his leg during the march, but as soon as he heard that there was going to be a battle, he had long forgotten the pain. He endured the pain and bravely rushed to the battlefield. In this battle, just as more than fifty enemies rushed towards the squad's position, he killed five American devils with a burst of bullets. The other enemies retreated. On the battlefield, Communist Party members bravely stood at the forefront of the battle. In marching and other tasks, Party members played an exemplary role. Under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, the Communist Youth League has grown stronger and has become a powerful assistant to the Party and political work. Some League members have been accepted as glorious Communist Party members because they have performed very bravely and stubbornly in battle.

Under the leadership of the higher-level Party, our Party branch has become the strong core of the company. The Party members motivated all the soldiers to actively work hard, making the Fifth Company a model combat company. In the defense of West Xingli, they held on for seven days and nights. On the first day, they defeated more than twenty attacks by the enemy's infantry, air force, and artillery, destroyed six enemy tanks, and captured five enemies, gloriously earning a collective first-class merit. In the future, we must maintain this glory and carry forward this glory to achieve even greater victories in battle.

This time, just as I was about to leave for Beijing, I heard the news from the radio broadcast—the people of the motherland, under the call of the China Peace Committee, launched a campaign to donate airplanes and cannons. This news inspired the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and cheers erupted on the front lines. After arriving in Beijing, I saw reports of donations of airplanes and cannons in the newspapers every day. Workers and peasants enthusiastically launched a production increase and donation campaign, and the business community also responded to the call of the China Peace Committee. Today, dozens of aircraft are donated here, and tomorrow, hundreds of aircraft are donated there. The people of Shandong Province plan to donate an air force division. I think that in the past, we had already achieved great victories without the participation of the air force in combat; after the people of the motherland donate a large number of airplanes and cannons, we will surely achieve more rapid and more brilliant victories. I will immediately tell these news to the Volunteer Army comrades who are fighting, which will surely have a greater inspiring effect on them. After I return from Berlin, I will quickly return to the Korean front, fight more bravely, work actively, and study hard, especially modern combined arms warfare military technology, to more effectively complete the task of annihilating the enemy. The Volunteer Army comrades will surely establish greater military exploits for the motherland, for the peace of the East and the world, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of our Party, and to repay the love and care of the people of the motherland for us.

Respectfully,
Zhou Wenjiang

Respected Chairman Mao:

I am a Communist Party member in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army serving as a company commander and branch committee member. This time, I was selected as a youth representative of the Volunteer Army to participate in the upcoming Third World Youth and Students for Peace Festival in Berlin. On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Party, I returned to the motherland from Korea. I feel extremely excited and happy to be able to commemorate the birthday of our Party in Beijing, the capital of our country.

Respected Chairman Mao, I am a people's soldier who came from among the millions of working people. I was originally from a poor peasant family. In the past, I worked as a hired laborer for the landlords for many years, living a life like a beast of burden. Since the Communist Party came, we were able to turn ourselves over, defeat the landlords, the Kuomintang, and the imperialist forces, become masters of the country, and forever get rid of the beast-like life, and our lives are getting better day by day.

However, the wicked US imperialism is not willing to see us live a good life. In June of last year, it launched an aggression against the peaceful Korean people. The flames of war were approaching the Yalu River, and it wanted to bring the war to our territory to destroy our peaceful life. At this critical juncture, the Chinese people formed the Volunteer Army to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and marched across the Yalu River with great enthusiasm to resist the imperialist offensive together with the Korean military and civilians.

I am a Communist Party member. In the past few years, under the education of the Party, I have deeply realized that the victory of the Chinese people is hard-won. In order to protect our peaceful and happy life and defend our motherland, I resolutely joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

After we crossed the Yalu River, we could see the inhumane atrocities of the American aggressor army everywhere, which aroused our unparalleled hatred for the enemy even more. For eight or nine months, under the unified command of the headquarters of the Korean People's Army, we fought side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army, severely打击打击the American aggressors, and won great victories one after another.

In the battle of Gunuli, we used a platoon of troops to resist the combined attack of dozens of times the enemy's strength, more than one hundred aircraft, and dozens of cannons. After a day of fierce fighting, the attacking enemy took back two or three hundred corpses, and we did not have a single casualty. At the most intense moment of the battle, Communist Party member Zhang Xianzhong proposed: "We are going abroad to fight on behalf of the 475 million Chinese people. We Chinese people will never play the coward in front of the American bandits and resolutely hold our position!" The comrades answered in unison: "As long as there is one person left, the position will be there!" After the war, we were awarded commendations from the higher authorities, and our entire platoon was named "Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon," and I and the other thirteen comrades each won a military merit. During the Fourth Campaign, I had been transferred to the Third Company as the company commander. In this campaign, our company blocked the combined fierce attack of a regiment of enemies and thirty aircraft, ninety tanks, three hundred vehicles, and dozens of cannons in East and West Guanting, inflicting heavy casualties on the attacking enemy. In this battle, Communist Party member Jiang Shifu, the artillery squad leader who had won four major merits, threw three sixty-mm shells by himself to resist the enemy on one side and kill or wound more than thirty enemies. After the war, the entire company was awarded the glorious title of "Fighting Heroically and Defending Tenaciously," I won three major merits, and another sixty-eight members of the company won major merits, and many soldiers and members of the Communist Youth League gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

One of the important reasons why our Volunteer Army can achieve victory after victory is due to the strong leadership of the Communist Party branch in the Volunteer Army and the leading role played by all Communist Party members. They ensured the victorious progress of each battle with their heroic, tenacious, and selfless spirit of sacrifice, and achieved the final victory. Although we also encountered many hardships and difficulties on the Korean battlefield, as soon as we thought of the Party and Chairman Mao, we felt that our whole body was filled with the power to move forward.

I have won some military merits in the battle against the American bandits this time, and now I have been selected to go abroad to participate in the World Youth and Students for Peace Festival, which is my greatest glory and happiness. However, these honors should be attributed to the Party and Chairman Mao's hard work and education and the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland for us. Without these, my personal honor would be out of the question. I feel that I should devote even greater efforts to the Party and the people. I will never feel the slightest bit complacent because the people have given me some honors. In the future, I will stand even more heroically at the forefront of defending the motherland and defending the peace of the Far East and the world, and make greater contributions to the happy life of the people of the motherland.

Respectfully wishing you,
Good health,
Guo Zhongtian

### 党鼓舞着我们胜利前进！志愿军战斗英雄周文江、郭忠田给毛主席的信

　　党鼓舞着我们胜利前进！
    志愿军战斗英雄周文江、郭忠田给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的生日“七一”快到了。正在这个时候，我——中国人民志愿军中的一个营参谋长、营党委员和战斗英雄，由于被选派参加即将在德国柏林召开的第三届世界青年学生和平联欢节大会，从朝鲜前线回到了祖国，回到了中国人民的首都——北京。今天，我要向你报告一些我们半年来在朝鲜与美帝国主义侵略军的作战情况和今后的决心。
    志愿军中的首长和中共上级党委很关心我和我们的部队。当我还在第五连当政治指导员的时候，师、团的首长经常亲自到我们连队里来参加各种会议，并且时常找我谈话；他们通过各种方式来教育我、培养我，使我在实际斗争中知道怎样来指挥部队，战胜敌人，并且使我成为一个光荣的战斗英雄。
    在上级党委领导下，我们部队、尤其是第五连的共产党支部，在战斗、行军等各方面都起了坚强的堡垒作用。共产党员经常以自己英勇战斗、艰苦卓著的模范行动，带领全体战士，完成各种艰巨的任务。在咸南战役守备一三七六高地中，敌人轮回地以四、五百人的兵力，配合着二十几架飞机，四、五辆坦克和数十门炮，向该连阵地攻击。战斗的第一天，支部青年委员刘生左同志就带领了一个班，击退敌人三、四次疯狂的反击，消灭了六十多个敌人。机枪组长共产党员严志强，虽然在行军时不幸腿部遭到跌伤，但一听说要战斗，早就把伤痛忘记了。他忍受住苦痛勇敢地奔赴战场。在这次战斗中，正值五十多个敌人向该班阵地冲过来，他以一梭子子弹，打死了五个美国鬼子。其他的敌人，就溃退下去了。在战场上，党员同志都是这样英勇地站在战斗的最前哨。在行军等其他各种任务中，党员同样地起了模范作用。青年团在党的领导培养下，已经壮大巩固起来，并且成为党与政治工作的有力助手。有的团员因为战斗中表现得非常勇敢顽强，已被接收为光荣的共产党员。
    在上级党的领导下，我们的党支部已成了连队坚强的核心，党员同志带动了全体战士积极努力，使第五连成为战斗模范连队。在西兴里守备战中，坚守了七昼夜。第一天就打垮了敌人步兵、空军和炮兵配合下的二十余次攻击，炸毁敌人坦克六辆，俘虏敌人五名，光荣地立了一个集体一等功。今后，我们一定要保持这个光荣，发扬这个光荣，在战斗中获得更大的胜利。
    这次，正当我动身来北京时，从无线电收音机里听到广播的消息——祖国人民在抗美援朝总会的号召下，开展捐献飞机大炮运动。这个消息振奋了中国人民志愿军的指挥员战斗员们，战线上发出了一片欢呼声。来到北京后，看到每天的报纸上都有捐献飞机大炮的报导。工人农民们都热烈地展开了增产捐献运动，工商界也响应了抗美援朝总会的号召。今天是这里捐几十架，明天是那里捐百十架，山东省人民并计划捐献一个空军师。我想，过去我们没有空军参加作战，就已获得了伟大的胜利；祖国人民捐献大量飞机大炮后，一定会更迅速地得到更辉煌的胜利。我要把这些消息立即告诉正在战斗着的志愿军同志们，这对他们定会起更大的鼓舞作用。我到柏林去回来以后，要迅速重返朝鲜前线，更加勇敢作战，积极工作，努力学习，尤其是要学习现代化联合作战的军事技术，更有效地完成歼敌的任务。志愿军同志们必将为祖国、为东方和世界的和平建立更大的战功，以此来庆祝我们党的三十周年，来报答祖国人民对我们的热爱和关怀。
          周文江敬爱的毛主席：
    我是中国人民志愿军中的一个共产党员担任连长和支部委员。这次，被选派为志愿军青年代表，准备去参加将要在柏林召开的第三届世界青年学生和平联欢节大会。在党的三十周年纪念日的前夕，从朝鲜回到了祖国。我能够在我国的首都——北京，来纪念我们党的生日，感到万分的兴奋和愉快。
    敬爱的毛主席，我是从千百万劳动人民当中走出来的一个人民战士。我原出身于贫苦的农民家里，过去长年给地主扛活，过着牛马的生活。自从共产党来了，我们才翻了身，打垮了地主、国民党和帝国主义势力，做了国家的主人，永远摆脱了牛马般的生活，而且生活一天比一天好起来了。
    可是，万恶的美帝国主义却不甘心看着我们过好日子，它在去年六月间即向和平的朝鲜人民，发动了侵略，战争的火焰节节地向着鸭绿江边逼近，它想把战火一直引到我们的国土上来，来破坏我们的和平生活。在这个紧要的关头，中国人民组成了抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿军，慷慨激昂地开过了鸭绿江，和朝鲜军民一起抵抗帝国主义的进攻。
    我是一个共产党员。几年来，在党的教养下，我深深地认识到中国人民的胜利，是来之不易的。为了保障我们和平幸福的生活，保卫我们的祖国，我坚决地参加了中国人民志愿军。
    我们渡过鸭绿江以后，到处可以看到美国侵略军惨无人道的暴行，更加激起了我们对敌人无比的仇恨。八、九个月来，我们在朝鲜人民军总部的统一指挥下，和英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，严重地打击了美国侵略者，接二连三获得了伟大的胜利。
    我们在军隅里的战役中，以一个排的兵力，抗击了敌人几十倍的兵力和一百多架飞机和数十门大炮的联合进攻，激战一天，使进攻的敌人带回去二、三百具死尸，我们没有一个伤亡。在战斗最激烈的时候，共产党员张献忠提出：“我们是代表四亿七千五百万中国人民出国作战的，我们中国人民，决不在美国强盗面前耍孬种，坚决守住我们的阵地！”同志大家异口同声地回答：“有一个人在，就有阵地在！”战后，荣获上级嘉奖，命名我们全排为“郭忠田英雄排”，我和其他十三个同志都各立一次战功。第四次战役的时候，我已调到三连任连长。这次战役，我们连在东西官亭，阻击了一个团的敌人和三十架飞机、九十辆坦克、三百辆汽车和数门大炮的联合猛烈进攻，给予进攻的敌人大量杀伤。这次战斗中，曾经立过四大功的炮班长共产党员姜世福同志，一个人扔出三发六○炮弹，抗击敌人一面，并杀伤敌人三十多个。战后，全连荣获“打的英勇，守的顽强”的光荣称号，我立了三大功，全连又有六十八名立了大功，并有不少战士，青年团员，光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    我们志愿部队，所以能取得一次又一次的胜利，重要原因之一，就是由于志愿部队中的共产党支部的坚强领导和全体共产党员起着带头作用。他们以英勇顽强和忘我的牺牲精神，保证了各次战斗的胜利进行，一直取得最后胜利。虽然，在朝鲜战场上，我们也遇到了不少的艰苦和困难，但是，我们一想到党和毛主席，我们就觉得浑身增加了前进的力量。
    我这次在和美国强盗作战当中，曾立了一些战功，现在又被选派出国参加世界青年学生和平联欢节大会，这是我最大的光荣和幸福。但是，这些光荣，应当归之于党和毛主席的辛勤教养和祖国人民对我们的热烈支援。没有这些，我个人的荣誉是无从谈起的。我觉得我对党和人民还应该尽更大的力量。我绝不因为人民给予我一些荣誉就感到丝毫自满。今后，我一定更英勇地站在保卫祖国、保卫远东与世界和平的最前线，为祖国人民的幸福生活，做出更大的贡献。
          敬祝
            身体健康
              郭忠田
