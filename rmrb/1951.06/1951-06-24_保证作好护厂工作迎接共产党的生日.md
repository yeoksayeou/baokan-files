　　Guarantee Good Factory Protection Work to Welcome the Communist Party's Birthday
　　　　　　　　Wang Tonglun
　　I welcome and celebrate the great "July 1st" – the Party's birthday – with utmost gratitude and excitement. That we, the workers of all of China, have been completely liberated and have become masters of the new society is all due to the heroic struggle of the past thirty years under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

　　It is precisely because of today's happiness that I am reminded of the suffering of the past. I started as an apprentice at the age of fourteen, and I was always beaten and scolded. With great difficulty, the Japanese devils were defeated, but then the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang came, and it was a complete mess again. If the Communist Party had not liberated us, I would probably have starved to death long ago.

　　After liberation, I had thoughts like this to some extent: "Workers just need to work, what's all this politics, anyway, we get paid for each day we work, as long as we don't slack off." Later, thanks to the Party's education and one fact after another, it was proven that we must improve our political consciousness today. Look! Cadres promoted from the masses of workers are being sent to various departments in batches, and workers also have seats to discuss national affairs. If we don't improve our political consciousness and working ability, can we take on such important work?! In the old society of the past, workers couldn't even dream of such a thing! At the same time, in order to cultivate us and make us masters of our own affairs, the Party has established literacy classes, technical classes, political classes, and so on. I can now write simple articles, and this is all thanks to the Party. My skills have improved compared to the puppet Manchukuo era, isn't this also the result of the Party's cultivation? My thinking has changed, and I have begun to understand politics, and I understand the reasons for the suffering in the past, and who our enemies are. It is precisely because of this that I had boundless strength when I fought the special agents this time. Because the Party's education is always in my heart, I know that protecting the factory is more important than protecting my own home. If my home suffers losses, it is one person's business, but if the factory suffers losses, it is a major event for the country and the people. After I was injured, the leaders of various agencies and organizations in Shenyang City personally came to comfort me, and I could see letters of condolence sent from thousands of miles away every day. I will never forget this great class friendship! Now that I have returned to my work post, I must further raise my class consciousness, play a model role in my work, guarantee the implementation of the patriotic pact, and do a good job in factory protection. This is also my gift to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Party.

　　保证作好护厂工作迎接共产党的生日
          王同伦
    我用万分感激和最兴奋的心情来迎接和庆祝伟大的“七一”——党的诞生日。我们全中国的工人，能彻底得到了解放，作了新社会的主人，这都是在毛主席、共产党的英明领导下三十年来英勇奋斗所得来的。
    正因为今天的幸福，才更使我回想到过去的痛苦。我十四岁就开始当学徒，当时总是挨打受骂。好容易日本鬼子失败了，那知道蒋家匪帮来了，又是一团糟。要不是共产党解放了我们，恐怕早就饿死了。
    在解放以后，我多少也有这样想法：“工人就知道干活，什么政治不政治的，反正干一天领一天工资，只要不磨洋工就行。”后来由于党的教育，和一件件事实给证明了，我们今天必须提高政治觉悟。看吧！一批一批的由工人群众中提拔出来干部输送到各部门里，商量国家大事也有工人的席位。不提高政治觉悟和工作能力，能担任这样重要的工作吗？！在过去的旧社会里，工人连这样梦也想不到啊！同时党为了培养我们，使我们当家作主人，成立文化班、技术班、上政治课等等。我现在能写出简单的文章，这都是党给我的。我的技术比伪满时提高了，这不也是党的培养的结果吗？我的思想转变了，开始对政治有了认识，明白了过去受苦的原因，谁是我们的敌人。也正因为这样，所以这次和特务搏斗时，才有了无限的力量。因为党的教育时时刻刻地记在我的心里，我知道爱护工厂，比爱护自己家重要的多，家里受损失是一个人的事，工厂要受损失是国家人民的大事。当我负伤以后，沈阳市各机关、团体的首长亲自来慰问我，天天能看到由几千里外寄来的慰问信，这种伟大的阶级友爱，使我永远忘不了！我回到了工作岗位，一定要更加提高阶级觉悟，在工作中起模范作用，保证实现爱国公约，做好护厂工作，这也是我迎接党的三十周年纪念日的献礼。
