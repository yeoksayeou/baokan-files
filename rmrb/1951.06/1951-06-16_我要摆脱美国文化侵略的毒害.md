I Want to Get Rid of the Poisonous Effects of American Cultural Aggression
Lang Yun, Student of Sociology Department, Yenching University

I am not a Communist Party member, nor am I a member of the Youth League; my thinking cannot be considered progressive, and my work even less active. But I am a Chinese. I want to stand from the perspective of a Chinese person and denounce the poisonous effects of American imperialist cultural aggression on me.

Before I came to Yenching University, I was a student at Shanghai University. There, I met an American professor who taught English. She seemed very concerned about me, often inviting me to dinner and tea. She was a Christian. She often talked to me about religious matters, and of course, often boasted about the "American way of life." She also said that if I studied hard, she would find an opportunity to send me to the United States to see the world in the future.

In this way, I was constantly fantasizing about living the life of an American. In my dreams, I would dream of living in New York. I often hated myself for not being an American, and I even had this shameful idea: If one day I went to the United States, maybe I would meet an American youth and marry him; in this way, I would live in the United States for the rest of my life. These fantasies made me willing to get close to that American professor; in order to please her, I agreed to be baptized before I had a deep understanding of Christianity.

When the American troops came to our own country, when those groups of American beast soldiers were running wild on our own land, not only did I not feel heartbroken, but I felt that it was a natural thing. I only saw that the American soldiers were well-dressed. When someone talked to me about the Soviet Union or the Communist Party, I always felt that they were poor and crude. I was fascinated by the adventurous, mysterious, and bestial love killings and charming romances in American movies. I thought these were what I needed in my life. What shameful and humble thoughts these were!

But, was my thinking born so humble? No, this is mainly the result of American imperialist cultural aggression. My father was an American student, and he encouraged me to go to the United States very early. After being poisoned by this, I almost didn't want to be Chinese anymore. What a terrible slave mentality this is! This mentality made me indifferent to the crimes of American imperialism in massacring the Chinese people, and this mentality made me have no hatred for the atrocities of American imperialism.

In the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, I gradually realized my own wrong thinking. This thinking was given to me by American imperialism; the result of this thinking is to recognize the enemy as my father! Now I have realized its harm to myself and to the nation. Only by thoroughly eliminating all imperialist "educational" influences in our thinking can we become good sons and daughters of the new China!

### 我要摆脱美国文化侵略的毒害

　　我要摆脱美国文化侵略的毒害
    燕京大学社会系学生　郎芸
    我不是一个共产党员，也不是一个青年团员；我的思想算不上进步，我的工作更不能算积极。但我是一个中国人。我要站在一个中国人的立场，来控诉美帝国主义文化侵略给我的毒害。
    当我还没有来燕京大学之前，我是上海沪江大学的学生。在那里，我认识了一个教英文的美国教授。她好像很关心我的样子，常常请我去吃饭喝茶。她是一个基督教徒。她常常和我谈论关于宗教的事情，当然也常常向我夸说“美国生活方式”。她还说如果我把书念好，将来找个机会还要把我送到美国去见识见识。
    这样，使我成天幻想着过美国人的生活，在睡梦中，我也会梦到生活在纽约。我常常恨我自己为什么不是一个美国人，我甚至有过这样可耻的想法：假使有一天我去了美国，也许我会碰见一位美国青年，和他结了婚；如此，我将一辈子住在美国。这些幻想，使我愿意和那个美国教授接近；为了讨好于她，当我对于基督教还没有深刻了解之前，便答应了受洗。
    当美国军队开到我们自己国土上来的时候，当那一群群的美国兽兵在我们自己的土地之上胡作非为的时候，我不仅不痛心，反而觉得那是自然的事。我只看到美国兵的衣服穿得好。有人和我谈到苏联或者共产党时，我总感到他们是穷苦的、粗野的。我迷恋着美国电影上那些冒险的、神秘的、兽性的情杀，和迷人的恋爱方式。我以为这些都是我生活上所需要的。这该是多么可耻的卑贱的思想！
    但是，我的思想一生下来就是如此卑贱的么？不是的，这主要是美帝国主义文化侵略的结果。我的父亲是美国留学生，他很早就鼓励我到美国去。中了这种毒之后，使我几乎不想做中国人了。这该是多么可怕的一种亡国奴心理啊！这种心理使我对于美帝国主义屠杀中国人民的罪行无动于衷，这种心理使我对于美帝国主义的暴行一点仇恨都没有。
    在抗美援朝运动中，我逐渐认识到我自己这种错误的思想了。这种思想是美帝国主义给我的；这种思想的结果就是认贼做父！如今我已认识到它对于自己和对于民族的危害性了。只有从思想上来彻底肃清一切帝国主义的“教育”影响，我们才有可能成为新中国的好儿女！
