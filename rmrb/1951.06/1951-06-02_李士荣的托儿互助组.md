Li Shirong's Childcare Mutual Aid Group
    Wen Ying
    In Baima Village, a small mountain village north of Yi County, Hebei Province, there is a small farmer-run nursery. It houses nine children from four families. The children are cared for by one mother, freeing up the other three mothers to work in the fields. The nursery has been organized for a full two years. Due to the children, the adults of these four families have also formed a production mutual aid group.

    This nursery was initiated by Li Shirong, the deputy director of the village women's federation. During the spring drought the year before last, the government called for mutual labor assistance to fight the drought and plant cotton. Most of the able-bodied men and women in the village participated in the mutual labor groups. Li Shirong, because she was raising three children, though willing to work, people were unwilling to partner with her. She was also unwilling to leave all the work on her twenty-four mu of land to her children's father. In the summer, she took the children to the fields, and they were sunburned like scorched brown birds, dark and yellow, which distressed her.

    Li Shirong was determined to solve the difficulty of taking care of children while working in the fields. She went to the homes of her neighbors Xue Ziqing, Du Xingrong, and Zhao Yuzhi to discuss with them: "We have many children, let's work together!" The situations of Sister-in-law Xue, Sister-in-law Du, and Sister-in-law Zhao were similar to hers. In the past, Sister-in-law Zhao's child fell ill from the heat in the fields, and the adults had to stay home with the child for two months. Sister-in-law Xue's child had diarrhea for three and a half months and became as thin as a monkey. They were delighted to hear what Li Shirong said, and they unanimously elected Sister-in-law Xue to look after the children at home, because Sister-in-law Xue was older, had small feet, making it inconvenient to work in the fields; moreover, she had a good temper and experience in taking care of children. Sister-in-law Xue's needlework and farm work were done by everyone else. They also formulated simple rules such as not allowing the children to drink cold water or eat things indiscriminately, and not letting the children catch cold. The three breastfeeding children were given a little milk by Sister-in-law Xue; the older children were told to take the younger children to play. This freed up three mothers to work in the fields. With three female helpers added to the fields, the farm work became much easier. The sowing, weeding, and harvesting of the year before last and last year were completed smoothly. The children were all very healthy during the two summers, with only one having diarrhea for two days.

    During the busy farming season, in addition to helping each other with childcare and work, they also helped each other with making lunch. Before going to the fields, they would give the rice for making lunch to Sister-in-law Xue. Sister-in-law Xue would look after the children and make lunch for the four families all at once. Li Shirong said: "Sister-in-law Xue is our children's head and our kitchen god."

    Last autumn, Yi County suffered a severe hailstorm. The harvest in Baima Village was very poor. After the autumn harvest, the four families bought a noodle rolling machine and helped each other roll noodles. The three women rolled noodles at home, and the four men went out to sell them. They worked like this for a winter and earned more than a large autumn harvest. This spring, they pooled fifteen jin and ten liang of cotton to spin yarn, which they exchanged for nine and a half bolts of cloth. The seventeen members of the four families could each make a new set of single-layer clothes.

    This spring was dry, but because they had three female helpers, the four families planted twenty-six mu of cotton without much difficulty.

    After being cared for and educated collectively, the children also developed good habits. For example, when Sister-in-law Xue took out a cake for the children to eat, the children would automatically share it, and the phenomena of fighting, grabbing, and scolding were also reduced.

    Under the influence of Li Shirong's childcare mutual aid group, a Yang Xiuzhen childcare mutual aid group has also emerged in Baima Village.

　　李士荣的托儿互助组
    文英
    河北省易县城北的小山庄白马村，有一个小小的农民托儿所。里面有属于四个家庭的九个孩子。孩子们由一个妈妈看管，腾出了三个妈妈下地作活。托儿所已经组织起来整整两年了。由于孩子的关系，这四家的大人们也结成了生产互助组。
    这个托儿所是该村妇联会副主任李士荣发起组织的。在前年春旱的时候，政府号召拨工互助，抗旱点种棉花。村子里大部分青壮年男女都参加了拨工互助组。李士荣因为拉扯着三个孩子，劳动虽好，人们却不愿意跟她搭帮作活。她又不愿意把二十四亩地的活都推给孩子的爹去做，夏天带着孩子下地，把孩子晒的像烧焦了的胡雀儿，黑黄黑黄的，她看着也难受。
    李士荣下决心解决下地带孩子的困难。她跑到近邻薛子清、杜兴荣、赵玉芝家里去，和她们商量：“咱们孩子多的伙着闹吧！”薛大嫂、杜大嫂、赵大嫂的光景都和她不相上下。过去赵大嫂的孩子跟着下地受热生了病，累的大人陪着孩子在家里呆了两个月。薛大嫂的孩子拉稀屎拉了三个半月，瘦的像猴子一样。他们听了李士荣的话，都很欢喜，便公推薛大嫂在家里看孩子，因为薛大嫂年岁大，脚小，下地不方便；此外，她的脾气好，看孩子又有经验。薛大嫂家里的针线活，地里的庄稼活，由大伙帮她作。他们又拟出了不许孩子们喝冷水或乱吃东西，不叫孩子们受凉等简单的规则。三个吃奶的孩子由薛大嫂贴一点奶；叫大点的孩子领小点的孩子玩。这样就使三个妈妈都下了地。地里一下子添了三个女帮手，庄稼活就好作多了。前年、去年的下种、锄地、收割，都松快地完成了。孩子们在两个夏天里，身体都很好，只有一个拉了两天稀屎。
    在农忙时，她们除带孩子、干活互助以外，做午饭也是互助的。在她们下地前，都把做午饭的米交给薛大嫂。薛大嫂一面看着孩子，一面就把四家的饭一齐作出了。李士荣说：“薛大嫂是我们的孩子头，又是我们的灶君头。”
    去秋，易县遭受严重雹灾。白马村的收成很不好。秋后，她们四家伙买了一架轧面机，互助轧挂面，三个女人在家里轧，四个男人出去卖。这样干了一冬，比一个大秋收的不少。今年春天，她们又凑了十五斤十两棉花伙纺线，换成了九个半布。四家十七口人，每人能作一身新单衣。
    今春天旱，因为有了三个女帮手，四家没费大事就点种了二十六亩棉花。
    孩子们在集体看管教育后，也养成了良好的习惯。譬如薛大嫂拿出一个饼子来给孩子吃，孩子们就自动分着吃，争、抢、打骂的现象也很少了。
    在李士荣托儿互助组的影响下，白马村又出现了一个杨秀珍托儿互助组。
