　　I want to forever maintain the title of Labor Model Guarantee to unite workers and eliminate machine obstacles
    ——A letter from Huang Ruixi, Labor Model of the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau

    Dear Chairman Mao:

    I am a 59-year-old worker with 35 years of seniority in this enterprise. During the rule of the Chiang bandits, I was always oppressed, living a life like a beast of burden. Since liberation, I have stepped out of darkness into the light. I realized that the Communist Party is the party of the working class itself, protecting the long-term interests of the working class. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, I worked actively and was selected as a labor model, and I was honored to attend the National Congress of Labor, Peasants and Soldiers, and received your kind education and praise. On March 15th of this year, the Industrial Labor Model Congress of our entire province was held, and more than 400 labor models emerged, and I was one of them. At the Labor Model Congress, I was respected by the heads of the People's Government and the masses. Especially during the "May Day" parade, hundreds of thousands of parading people shouted "Salute to the labor models!" "Learn from the labor models!" Chairman Mao! I thought: The difference between the old and new worlds is too great! In the old society, the good things we did were taken away by the ruling class; when we did poorly, we suffered all kinds of bullying and scolding. Now, because I have made some contributions to production, I have been given the glorious title of labor model. This glory is given to me by you and the Party, and it is also the glory of all the working people. The staff of the Central Room of our Changsha Telecommunications Bureau was also elected as the Collective Labor Model of the Central South Postal and Telecommunications Area. Because of good study, improved political awareness, clear understanding of the responsibility of being masters of our own affairs, and the enthusiasm for labor, under the leadership of the Party and the cultivation of the administration and the trade union, we displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm in the patriotic production competition and established various work systems. From February 4th to now (June 20th), for 135 days, we have created a record of no machine failures due to negligence, improved two types of machines, improved one type of tool, doubled work efficiency, and improved three types of operation methods. We have exceeded our monthly targets. Chairman Mao! We are not complacent and are willing to follow you closely and move forward victoriously forever. On the 30th anniversary of our working class's Party, I would like to extend my revolutionary salute to you and thank the Party and you for liberating the working people of the whole country! I would like to make the following six guarantees to you: (1) Strive to maintain the glorious title of Labor Model for a long time; (2) Lead our group and the surrounding workers to continue to make contributions on the production front; (3) Teach six apprentices to learn measurement techniques this year; (4) Guarantee to unite all employees to completely eliminate machine obstacles; (5) Guarantee to implement the patriotic pact, increase production and donate airplanes and artillery; (6) Strive to gloriously join the Communist Party of China this year.

　　我要永远保持劳动模范称号  保证团结工友消灭机器障碍
    ——长沙电信局劳动模范黄瑞熙的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我是一个五十九岁工人，有三十五年本企业工龄。在蒋匪统治的时候，我一直是受压迫，过着牛马般的生活。自解放后，我由黑暗走入光明。我认识了共产党是工人阶级自己的党，是保护工人阶级长远利益的。在党的教育和培养下，我工作积极，被评选为劳动模范，光荣出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，接受了您亲切的教育和表扬。今年三月十五日，我们全省工业劳动模范代表大会召开时，涌现了劳动模范四百多人，我也是其中之一。在劳动模范大会上，受着人民政府首长及人民群众的尊重。特别是在“五一”大游行时，几十万游行群众，喊着“向劳动模范致敬！”“向劳动模范学习！”毛主席啊！我想到：新旧两个世界的分别太大了！旧社会里做得好的事情，都被统治阶级占去了；做得不好时，受尽了欺凌和责骂。现在我在生产上有些贡献，就得到劳动模范的光荣称号。这是您和党给我的光荣，也就是全体劳动人民的光荣。我们长沙电信局中央室职工也当选为中南区邮电集体劳动模范。因为学习搞得好，提高了政治觉悟，明确地认识了主人翁的责任，发挥了劳动积极性，在党的领导和行政、工会培养之下，在爱国主义生产竞赛上，发挥了高度的爱国热情，建立了各种工作制度。自二月四日起到现在（六月二十日），一百三十五天，创造了机器无责任障碍的纪录，改进了两种机器，改良了一种工具，提高了工作效率一倍，改良了三种操作方法。每月都超额完成任务。毛主席！我们没有自满，愿紧紧跟着您永远胜利前进。我们工人阶级的党三十周年纪念日，我谨向您致革命敬礼，感谢党和您使全国劳动工人翻了身！我向您提出保证，要做好六件事：（一）争取长期保持光荣的劳动模范称号；（二）带着我们小组和周围的工人兄弟们，在生产战线上继续立功；（三）在今年内教好六个徒弟学会测量技术；（四）保证团结全体职工们，彻底消灭机器障碍；（五）保证执行爱国公约，增产捐献飞机大炮；（六）今年内争取光荣加入中国共产党。
