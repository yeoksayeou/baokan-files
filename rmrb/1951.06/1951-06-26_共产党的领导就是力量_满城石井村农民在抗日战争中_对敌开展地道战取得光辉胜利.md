    The Leadership of the Communist Party is Strength
    Man Cheng Shijing Village Peasants Achieved a Glorious Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan by Carrying out Tunnel Warfare Against the Enemy
    The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China is approaching. The people of China are cheering for the arrival of this great day. The people of Mancheng County will never forget how the Communist Party led the people in an indomitable struggle against the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and finally achieved victory.
    From the history of the struggle against the enemy by the people of Shijing Village, Mancheng County, we can see how the Communist Party raised the awareness of the people, pointed out a bright future for the people, made the people realize their own strength, and led the people to victory.
    Shijing Village is a mountain village with 705 households and more than 2,800 people. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang abandoned large tracts of land to the enemy. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army went deep into the enemy's rear, established anti-Japanese democratic base areas, and led the people to fight against the enemy. In 1939, the Party organization was established in Shijing Village. Under the leadership of the Party, anti-Japanese organizations such as the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard and the Farmers' Association were established in the village. In 1941, the Japanese invaders carried out an autumn sweep. Communist Party members in the village took the lead and established guerrilla groups. At that time, there were only seven members in the group, and the weapons were only three guns and a dozen hand grenades. However, the leadership of the Communist Party is strength. It was this guerrilla group that undertook the anti-Japanese work of guarding against the enemy, protecting cadres, destroying enemy transportation lines, and escorting public grain, and became stronger and more consolidated in the struggle against the powerful enemy. In 1942 and 1943, the enemy built bunkers everywhere and implemented the "Three Alls Policy," cruelly slaughtering the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Shijing Village realized even more that the Chinese people could only survive by defeating the Japanese devils. The masses of the whole village took action and dug a tunnel that ran through the entire village. From then on, the people of Shijing Village carried out tunnel warfare against the enemy, inflicting great blows on the enemy. The peasants of Shijing Village, fighting under the leadership of the Communist Party, displayed amazing wisdom and great strength in the battle. For example, in the autumn of 1944, one day, more than 600 cadres were meeting in Shijing Village. When the enemy found out, they gathered more than 5,000 troops and surrounded Shijing Village at dawn. The guerrilla group discovered the enemy's situation, engaged the enemy in fire, and fought the enemy for two hours, covering all the cadres attending the meeting and more than 3,000 people from the village to safely enter the tunnel. The guerrilla group then lured the enemy into the village and launched tunnel warfare. The enemy could not find our people, but encountered landmines and gunfire everywhere. At dusk, the enemy retreated, and the guerrilla group bravely pursued the enemy. In this battle, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 46 enemies were killed; our side suffered no losses. As a result, the Shijing Village guerrilla group won the glorious title of model militia, and Li Quanxue and Xiao Deshun were also selected as combat heroes of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region at that time.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Mancheng have gone through heroic struggles. The people of Mancheng will always follow the Communist Party and fight for a better future for themselves.

    共产党的领导就是力量
    满城石井村农民在抗日战争中
    对敌开展地道战取得光辉胜利
    中国共产党三十周年纪念日快到了。全中国的人民都为这个伟大日子的来临而欢呼。我们满城县人民将永远不会忘记，在抗日战争中，共产党怎样领导着人民和日本强盗进行了不屈不挠的斗争，终于取得了胜利。
    就从满城县石井村人民对敌斗争的历史中，我们就可以看出，共产党怎样提高了人民的觉悟，给人民指出了光明的出路，使人民认识了自己的力量，并且领导人民走向胜利。
    石井村是一个有七百零五户、二千八百多人的山村。抗日战争爆发后，国民党把大块的土地丢给了敌人。共产党、八路军就深入敌后，建立了抗日民主根据地，领导人民进行对敌斗争。一九三九年，石井村开始建立了党的组织。在党的领导下，村中建立了青年抗日先锋队、农会等抗日组织。一九四一年，日寇进行秋季大扫荡，村中共产党员带头，建立了游击小组。那时组员只有七个人，武器只有三杆枪、十来个手榴弹，但是，共产党的领导就是力量。就是这个游击小组，担负着警戒敌人，保护干部、破坏敌人交通线、护送公粮等抗日工作，并且在和强大的敌人斗争中，更加壮大，更加巩固起来。一九四二年和一九四三年，敌人到处建造碉堡，实行“三光政策”，更加残酷地屠杀中国人民。石井村的人民，在共产党的领导下，更认清了只有打败日本鬼子，中国人民才有活路。全村群众行动起来，挖了一个贯通全村的地道。从此，石井村人民就和敌人进行地道战，给敌人以很大的打击。在共产党领导下斗争的石井村农民，在战斗中发挥了惊人的智慧和巨大的力量。如一九四四年秋后，有一天，六百多干部在石井村开会。敌人知道了，就集合了五千多人的兵力在一天拂晓包围了石井村。游击小组发现敌情，就和敌人接了火，和敌人打了两小时，掩护了开会的干部和本村群众三千多人全部安全进入地道。游击小组又把敌人诱进村来，展开了地道战。敌人找不到我们的人，却到处碰到地雷和射击。黄昏时，敌人撤退了，游击小组又英勇地追击敌人。这一次战斗，据不完全统计，击毙敌人共四十六名；我方一无损失。于是，石井村游击小组获得了模范民兵的光荣称号，李全学、萧德顺并且被选为了当时晋察冀边区的战斗英雄。
    满城人民在共产党领导下经过了英勇的斗争。满城人民将永远跟着共产党走，为自己更美好的将来而斗争。
