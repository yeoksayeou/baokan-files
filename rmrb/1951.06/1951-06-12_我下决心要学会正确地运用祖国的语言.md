    I am Determined to Learn to Use the Motherland's Language Correctly
    To the Editor:
    After reading the People's Daily editorial on June 6th, "Correctly Use the Motherland's Language, and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!", I am determined to learn to correctly use the rich and beautiful language of the motherland and to learn how to write articles.
    I work in a government agency and often have to draft official documents. However, most of my drafts are grammatically incorrect or do not express my meaning clearly. Sometimes I have a lot to say, but I always feel unable to start writing; sometimes I write things that I understand, but others don't know what they mean. As for the use of words, phrasing, and the structure of articles, there are even more problems. When I submit a draft of an official document to my superiors for review, it is often revised beyond recognition; sometimes it even forces the leading comrades to rewrite it completely. However, in the past, I did not attach importance to learning to write articles. Instead, I made excuses for not being able to write well: "As long as the meaning of official documents is correct, why demand too much?" When I met comrades from the countryside, I even complained a little: "In the past, we could get things done with a short note; now that we've entered the city, even writing official documents has to be formalized, which is simply nitpicking."
    This kind of thinking is incorrect. As the editorial says: "Every document of the government agencies..., exists to propagate the truth, instruct on tasks and methods to the masses." In order to correctly instruct the subordinate agencies on tasks and methods, in order to concisely reflect the situation below to the higher leading agencies, in order to save the leading comrades time in revising drafts, and in order to improve our work efficiency, I must learn to write articles well.
    I have decided to seriously study the "Grammar and Rhetoric Lectures" published in the People's Daily, practice writing more, and carefully study the revisions made by leading comrades to my drafted official documents, so that my writing ability can be gradually improved.

### 我下决心要学会正确地运用祖国的语言

    我下决心要学会正确地运用祖国的语言编辑同志：
    读了人民日报六月六日社论《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！》后，我下决心要学会正确地运用祖国丰富优美的语言，学会写文章。
    我在政府机关里作工作，经常要起公文稿。但是我写的稿子大部分文法不通，或辞不达意。有时候有一肚子的话想要说，但总是感到无从写起；有时写出来的东西自己看着明白，别人看了就不知道是什么意思。至于在用字、措辞和文章结构上，毛病就更多了。我起草的一篇公文稿，送给上级核阅时，常常修改得好像一个大花脸一样；有时甚至使领导同志不得不重新写过。但是我过去思想上并不重视学习写文章，反而给自己找写不通文章的借口：“写公文意思对了就行了，何必要求太高呢？”见了从农村来的同志们还发个小牢骚：“过去写个小条子就可以办事；现在进了城连写公文也得正规化，简直是咬文嚼字。”
    这种思想是不正确的。正如社论里所说：“政府机关的每一个文件……，都是为了向群众宣传真理、指示任务和方法而存在的。”为了向被领导机关正确地指示任务和方法，为了把下面的情况简明地反映给上级领导机关，为了节省领导同志修改稿件的时间，为了提高我们的工作效率，我就非得学好写文章不可。
    我决定要认真研究人民日报刊载的“语法、修辞讲话”，多多练习写作，并且仔细研究领导同志对我起草公文所作的修改，使我的写作能力逐步提高。
