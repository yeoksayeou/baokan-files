Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch. According to a dispatch from the Electric News Agency correspondent in Rangoon, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao National United Front, who recently visited Vietnam, stated to the local press that people's power has been firmly established in one-sixth of Laos, guerrilla forces and liberation armies control over one-third of the country's land, and democratic elections for local committees of the Lao National United Front have been conducted in over two-thirds of the country. Souphanouvong continued, stating that the colonialists planned to recruit volunteers for their army from Lao youth, but this plan failed. The new recruits they enlisted returned to the liberated areas with weapons and equipment. The growth of the people's armed forces has greatly strengthened the National United Front, leaving the French aggressors at a loss. Souphanouvong pointed out that since its establishment in 1950, the Lao National United Front has been educating the people in the spirit of resisting the enemy and building the nation, and exposing the enemy's propaganda aimed at dividing the Lao people and alienating the Lao people from the Vietnamese and Cambodian people.

　　老挝民族统一阵线主席谈老挝解放运动
    【新华社二日讯】据电通社驻仰光记者报道，不久以前访问越南的老挝民族统一阵线主席苏发努冯亲王，对该地报界发表谈话称：老挝六分之一的地区内已巩固地建立了人民政权，全国三分之一以上的土地为游击队与解放军所控制，全国三分之二的土地上已进行过老挝民族统一阵线地方委员会的民主选举。苏发努冯继称：殖民者计划从老挝的青年中为其军队征募志愿兵，可是，这个计划失败了。被他们征募去的新兵带着武器与装备回到了解放区。人民武装力量的增长大大地加强了民族统一阵线，结果使法国侵略者不知所措。苏发努冯指出：老挝民族统一阵线自一九五○年成立以来，一直以反抗敌人的精神和国家建设的精神教育人民，并揭发旨在分化老挝人民、离间老挝人民与越南人民及柬埔寨人民的敌意宣传。
