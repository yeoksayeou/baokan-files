　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government issued the "Notice on Abolishing the 'No Pregnant Women' Rule when Recruiting Staff and Trainees" to all Commissions, Ministries, Committees, Academies, Administrations, and Banks of the Central Government, the People's Governments (Military and Political Committees) of all Major Administrative Regions, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the People's Governments of all Provinces and Cities in North China at the end of May.

　　The notice stipulates that in the future, when recruiting staff and trainees, all government agencies should abolish the "No Pregnant Women" rule or any similar provisions, as they are inconsistent with the spirit of the Common Program. If a particular job or study is indeed unsuitable for pregnant women, it must be determined based on a hospital or doctor's examination, proving the pregnant woman's health and specific circumstances, before a pregnant woman can be rejected. The notice also suggests that all government agencies, especially the personnel departments, adopt specific and effective measures to examine whether there are erroneous ideas of discrimination against women within their own agencies, deeply study the clear provision in the Common Program that "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system which fetters women. Women shall enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life;" and requires that, in conjunction with the specific circumstances of their own agencies, they reform and improve various systems and measures related to the education, welfare, and work of women cadres.

　　中央人民政府人事部发出通知
    机关招考工作人员及学员废除“不收孕妇”的规定
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府人事部于五月底向中央各委、部、会、院、署、行，各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）、内蒙古自治区人民政府、华北各省市人民政府发出《关于废除招考工作人员及学员时“不收孕妇”规定的通知》。
    通知规定今后各机关招考工作人员及学员时，应废除“不收孕妇”或有类似含义的规定，因为这是和共同纲领的精神不相符合的。如果确有某项工作或学习不适于孕妇参加时，必须经过医院或医生的检查，证明孕妇的健康等具体情况后，始得不收孕妇。通知并建议各机关，首先是各机关的人事部门，采用具体有效的办法检查本机关是否存在歧视妇女的错误思想，深刻学习共同纲领中“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。”这一项明确的规定；并要求结合本机关的具体情况，改革和改进对于妇女干部教育、福利、工作等各项制度和措施。
