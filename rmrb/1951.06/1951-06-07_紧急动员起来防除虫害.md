　　Immediately Mobilize to Prevent and Eliminate Pests

Recently, locust nymphs, rice borers, cotton aphids, wheat thrips, wireworms, and red spiders have been found to be harming crops in many areas. Although it is just beginning, it is quite widespread. Locust nymphs have been found in many counties in northern Anhui, Shandong, and Hebei. In these areas, locust nymphs are growing rapidly in large numbers, and in two or three weeks, they will turn into migratory locusts. According to surveys, the density of "scattered" migratory locusts was very high last year, and there is a possibility of a large-scale locust outbreak this year. Rice borers have been found in Fujian, Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu. Cotton aphids have been found in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and other places, and are crawling from parasitic weeds onto cotton seedlings. In addition, the area affected by other insect pests is also considerable.

Based on the above situation, if the local leading organs do not immediately grasp the work of preventing and eliminating insect pests, it will inevitably lead to a major disaster and affect the achievements of the patriotic production increase campaign.

In order to quickly do a good job in preventing and eliminating insect pests, we believe that in areas where insect pests have already occurred, the local leading organs should immediately organize insect control command structures, mobilize the broad masses of peasants urgently, concentrate forces, and strive to completely eliminate insect pests in the shortest possible time. Areas where locust nymphs have been found should be immediately eliminated to prevent them from becoming migratory locusts. In cotton-growing areas where cotton aphids have been found, in addition to preparing pesticides such as cotton oil soap, tobacco stalks, lime, and alkali, a movement to eliminate weeds should be launched immediately, involving women and children. Areas where rice borers have been found should also be organized immediately to capture them, striving to eliminate them before they become a major disaster. In addition, in areas adjacent to those where pests have been found, the masses should be organized to conduct field inspections, and if pests are found at any time, they should be eliminated immediately. To this end, information links should be established between districts and villages. Once a pest is found in one place, it should be reported to the higher authorities immediately, and forces should be organized to eliminate it, and neighboring areas should be notified to take precautions immediately.

The prevention and control of some insect pests requires the preparation and use of pesticides and equipment (such as safe cotton oil emulsion, lime sulfur mixture, etc.). Various localities should use agricultural gaps to convene district and village cadres, labor models, etc., to conduct short-term technical training, and spread it to the masses through them, so that they can universally master and use it.

In the entire summer production work, all localities should list the prevention and elimination of insect pests as one of the main tasks, and lead the peasants to arrange time to carry out the work of preventing and eliminating insect pests simultaneously and without any relaxation, while carrying out summer selection, summer harvesting, and summer planting.

### 紧急动员起来防除虫害

　　紧急动员起来防除虫害
    最近许多地区发现蝗蝻、稻螟、棉蚜及小麦吸浆虫、金针虫、红蜘蛛等为害作物，虽然是刚刚开始，但却相当普遍。发现蝗蝻的地区，目前已有皖北、山东及河北的不少县份。在这些地区蝗蝻大量迅速生长，再过两三星期，即可变成飞蝗。据调查，去年各地“散居型”飞蝗密度很大，今年蝗虫有大量发生的可能。发现稻螟的，已有福建、浙江、皖南、苏南等地。棉蚜虫则在河北、平原、山东等地都已发现，并正从寄生的杂草中爬到棉苗上。此外，发生其他虫害的地区，面积也不小。
    根据上述情况，各地领导机关如不立即抓紧防除虫害的工作，势必酿成大的灾害，影响爱国丰产运动的成就。
    为了迅速做好防除虫害的工作，我们认为在已发生虫害的地区，当地领导机关应立即组织除虫指挥机构，把广大农民，紧急动员起来，集中力量，争取在最短的时间内，把虫害彻底扑灭。发现蝗蝻的地区，要求立即加以消灭，不让它变成飞蝗。发现棉蚜的植棉地区，除准备棉油皂、烟草梗、石灰、碱面等农药外，应立即发动妇女儿童展开清除杂草运动。发现稻螟虫地区，亦应马上组织捕捉，务求在未成大灾时予以消灭。此外，在发现害虫的邻近地区，亦应组织群众进行田间检查，随时发现，即予消灭。为此，区乡间应建立情报联系。一处发现，立即报告上级，组织力量扑灭；并通知近邻，立即防范。
    有些虫害的防治需要配制和使用药械（如安全棉油乳剂、石灰硫磺合剂等），各地应利用农隙召集区村干部、劳动模范等，进行短日程的技术训练，通过他们传播到群众中去，使能普遍掌握运用。
    在整个夏季生产工作中，各地应把防除虫害列为主要任务之一，领导农民安排时间，与进行夏选、夏收、夏种同时，丝毫不放松地交错地进行防除虫害的工作。
