Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 11th—The 52nd International Exposition held in Czechoslovakia closed on the 5th. Nearly 1.5 million people visited during the eighteen days, 50% more than at the 51st International Exposition last year. The Chinese exhibits, participating in the Exposition for the first time, received special attention and praise from visitors. During the later period of the Exposition, the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and many members of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, as well as President Gottwald's wife, carefully visited the Chinese pavilion. Czechoslovak Premier Zápotocký visited the Chinese pavilion twice.

The Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign Trade, Gregor, delivered a radio speech on the 5th summarizing the achievements of the Exposition, praising the success of the Soviet and Chinese pavilions. Czechoslovak newspapers unanimously gave high praise to the Chinese exhibits. The "Red Right" newspaper commented on May 25th: "The Chinese exhibits are worthy of admiration. They show us the richness of China and introduce China's already developed industry." The Czechoslovak Trade Union newspaper "Labor Daily" said on the same day: "Chinese products are diverse and magnificent. In them, we see the grand construction of New China, the increase in production, and the improvement of people's living standards." The Czech Farmers' Union newspaper "Agricultural Daily" commented on May 22nd: "After seeing the Chinese exhibits, our working people are even more convinced that the friendly relations between us and the People's Republic of China will be further developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; and are even more convinced that the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has the strong support of the Chinese people." The Czechoslovak Socialist Party newspaper "Free Talk" wrote on May 31st: "The artistic talents of Chinese laborers, with thousands of years of tradition, have served the creators of New China. This artistic talent will create newer and more valuable things for the Chinese people's happier and more fulfilling new life." The most widely circulated Czech magazine "World Pictorial" recently used a front view of the Chinese pavilion as its cover.

In the three large volumes of comment books in the Chinese pavilion, were filled with congratulations from people of all walks of life in Czechoslovakia to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. In the comment books, there are many opinions written in Greek, Indonesian, French, and Italian, as well as Chinese characters that are obviously written by foreigners. They praised China's silk fabrics, textiles, and exquisite handicrafts, and were extremely excited that China's vast resources are now completely serving the cause of peace.

　　捷“国际博览会”闭幕        
    我国展览品备受赞赏
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】捷克斯洛伐克举办的第五十二届国际博览会已于五日闭幕。十八天内参观的人将近一百五十万，比去年第五十一届国际博览会的参观者多百分之五十。头一次参加博览会的我国展览品，受到参观者的特别重视和赞赏。在博览会后期，捷克斯洛伐克共产党总书记和许多捷共中央委员以及哥特瓦尔德总统夫人都仔细参观了中国馆，捷总理萨波托斯基曾两度到中国馆参观。
    捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部长格里哥尔五日发表广播讲演，总结博览会的成就，盛赞苏联馆和中国馆的成功。捷克斯洛伐克各报对中国展览品一致给予很高的评价。五月二十五日的“红色权利”报评论说：中国展览品值得赞赏。它向我们展示了中国的富饶，并且介绍了中国已获得发展的工业。同一天的捷克斯洛伐克工会机关报《劳动报》说：“中国产品是花样繁多而辉煌的，在这里面我们看到新中国的宏大建设、生产的增加和人民生活水平的提高。”捷克农民联盟机关报《农业报》五月二十二日评论说：“我国劳动人民看过了中国展览品之后，更加深信我们和中华人民共和国之间的友好关系将在平等互惠的基础上获得更进一步的发展；更加深信以苏联为首的和平阵营得到了中国人民的坚强的支持。”五月三十一日的捷克斯洛伐克社会党机关报《自由谈》写道：有着数千年传统的中国劳动者的艺术才能，已为新中国的创造者服务了，这种艺术才能将为中国人民的更为幸福和充实的新生活创造更新的更珍贵的东西。捷克销路最广的《世界画报》最近一期就用中国馆的正面照片作了封面。
    在中国馆的三大册意见本中，写满了捷克斯洛伐克各阶层人民对中国人民、中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席的祝贺。在意见本里可以看到许多用希腊文、印尼文、法文和意大利文以及显然是出于外国人手笔的中国字写下的意见，他们赞美中国的丝织品、纺织品和精巧的手工艺品，对中国广大的富源目前已完全为和平事业服务感到异常兴奋。
