Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: The "Red Star Newspaper" published an article commenting on the Korean War situation in the past three weeks. The Red Star Newspaper wrote: Because the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army struck the US-British aggressor troops on May 17, the aggressor troops were forced to retreat south, suffering huge losses. The US military command then投入投入 (poured in) new reserves on May 23, reorganized its troops, and launched another offensive. The US military command planned to conduct large-scale operations to defeat the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and break into northern Korea; it妄图 (vainly attempted) to change the Korean War situation with this new offensive by British and American troops. American and British newspapers also 大事宣传 (greatly publicized) this offensive.

However, the hopes placed on this new offensive by the aggressor troops have not been realized. The progress of the war proves that the US military command's plan is still destined to fail this time. From the beginning of the aggressor troops' offensive, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army carried out顽强的 (stubborn) resistance. Fighting side by side, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army repelled the fierce attacks of the aggressor troops with active defensive warfare and ambush warfare, annihilating their manpower and equipment. After that, fierce encounters occurred across the entire front, often evolving into hand-to-hand combat. In these defensive battles, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army once again demonstrated their skillful combat techniques, heroism, and bravery.

The aggressor troops suffered huge losses in these battles. As early as May 30—the seventh day of the offensive—foreign newspapers had to admit that the US-British troops had encountered有力 (strong) resistance from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and were forced to reduce their speed of advance, and even停顿 (stalled) in some areas. The US military command's plan was thus挫败 (thwarted) by the heroic actions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Van Fleet's吹嘘 (boastful) statements, which caused delirious ravings in the American newspapers, have now given way to the gloomy忧虑 (anxieties) of British and American people about the development of the Korean War situation.

### 中朝人民部队英勇阻击  美军指挥部计划遭到挫败  红星报评论三周来朝鲜战局

　　中朝人民部队英勇阻击
    美军指挥部计划遭到挫败        
    红星报评论三周来朝鲜战局
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：《红星报》载文评论过去三个星期来的朝鲜战局。红星报写道：由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在五月十七日给予美英侵略军以打击，侵略军被迫向南退却，遭受巨大的损失。美军指挥部又在五月二十三日投入了新的后备队，整顿了它的部队，发动了另一次攻势。美军指挥部计划进行大规模作战，击溃朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并突入朝鲜北部；它妄图以英美军队的这次新攻势改变朝鲜的战局。美国和英国报纸并大事宣传这次进攻。
    然而，寄托在侵略军这次新攻势上的希望并没有实现。战局的进展证明了，美军指挥部的计划，这一次仍旧注定了是实现不了的。从侵略军的攻势开始时起，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军便进行了顽强的抵抗。并肩作战的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军战士们以积极的防御战和伏击战击退了侵略军的猛烈进攻，消灭了他们的有生力量和装备。此后全线便发生了时常演变为肉搏战的激烈的遭遇战。在这些防御战中，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的战士们再度表现了他们的巧妙的作战技术、英雄主义和勇敢。
    侵略军在这些战斗过程中遭受了巨大的损失。早在五月三十日——攻势的第七天——外国报纸就不得不承认美英军队遭到了朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的有力抵抗，被迫减低了他们的前进速度，在有些地区甚至停顿下来。美军指挥部的计划就这样被朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的英勇行动所挫败了。范佛里特的吹嘘声明在美国报纸上引起的呓语现在又让位给英美人士对于朝鲜战局发展的阴暗的忧虑了。
