The Central People's Government's General Administration of Press and Publication issued the following call on the 7th of this month to its affiliated institutions and national publishing workers:

　　"On June 6, 1951, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled 'Correct Use of the Motherland's Language, Struggle for the Purity and Health of Language!' and began publishing 'Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric' on the same day. Publishing workers should actively respond to this call. We are propagandists, and our main tool of propaganda is language. We must use correct and clear language to tell the masses about theories, policies, work experience, and cultural knowledge, and conduct propaganda among the masses. As the saying goes, 'If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools.' However, in our publications, there are often problems such as a lack of organization, empty talk, ungrammatical writing, and the indiscriminate creation of new words. Our books and magazines often exhibit linguistically intolerable chaos. Publishing administrative agencies in various regions must seriously address this phenomenon and conduct an active and effective struggle against it. To this end, 'Correct Use of the Motherland's Language, Struggle for the Purity and Health of Language!' is specifically designated as a study document for publishing administrative agencies and enterprises. Study must be linked to practice, linked to publications, and plans for improvement must be developed. 'Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric' must be used as regular professional study material."

　　出版总署号召全国出版工作者学习《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！》和《语法、修辞讲话》
    中央人民政府出版总署本月七日对所属机构和全国出版工作者发出如下的号召：
    “一九五一年六月六日人民日报发表‘正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！’的社论并同日开始刊登‘语法、修辞讲话’。出版工作者应该积极响应这一号召。我们是宣传工作者，我们宣传的主要工具是语文。我们要将理论、政策、工作经验、文化知识用正确而明晰的语文告诉群众，向群众进行宣传。古语说：‘工欲善其事，必先利其器’。但是在我们的出版物中，却经常有缺乏条理、空话连篇、文理不通、滥造新词的毛病。我们的书籍杂志中经常表现出语文上不可容忍的混乱现象。各地出版行政机构必须严肃地重视这种现象，并向这种现象进行积极而有效的斗争。为此，特指定“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”为出版行政机构与企业机构的学习文件。学习中必须联系实际，联系出版物，定出改进的计划。‘语法、条辞讲话’必须作为经常的业务学习材料。”
