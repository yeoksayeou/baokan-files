    Trainee Comrades of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
    Ni Zongtang, and Others Capture a Fugitive Special Agent
    Editor Comrade:
    Ni Zongtang, Hu Shouxi, and other trainee comrades of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Reporting Training Class, with high vigilance, captured Zeng Zhenhua, a special agent who had fled from Tianjin to Beijing.
    At approximately 8:45 PM on May 14th, the comrades of the Reporting Training Class were engaged in cultural and recreational activities when someone came looking for Ni Zongtang and Hu Shouxi. When they went out to see who it was, it turned out to be Zeng Zhenhua (telegram delivery man) from the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau. Zeng Zhenhua stammered that he had already resigned from his job and wanted to go to Suiyuan to see his sister. Because he didn't have travel expenses, he wanted to borrow some money. Upon hearing this, Comrades Ni Zongtang and Hu Shouxi became suspicious: "Why is this fellow unwilling to work? There might be a problem." They returned to the class and discussed it with everyone. Upon hearing this situation, the union chairman, Yao Chengkang, said: "We must heighten our vigilance! First, let's inquire about the situation from the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau." The comrades immediately placed a long-distance call to the Tianjin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau while having two people continue talking to Zeng Zhenhua.
    Around eleven o'clock, the call came from Tianjin, saying: "Zeng Zhenhua worked as a special agent in the Gendarmerie during the Japanese puppet regime and harmed people; during the Kuomintang period, he relied on his position to bully workers in the Telecommunications Bureau. The staff of the Tianjin Bureau exposed him at accusation meetings, and the Public Security Bureau was going to arrest him, but he escaped. Please detain him quickly." After receiving the call, the comrades immediately called the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief only after the public security officers arrested the counter-revolutionary element Zeng Zhenhua. When he was arrested, Zeng even cursed at everyone, saying: "I waited such a long time and couldn't borrow money. It turns out you were plotting against me. What kind of friends are you?" Before he could finish speaking, everyone angrily pointed at him and said: "Who is friends with you? You are a special agent, you are our enemy! We will never let you go."

    邮电部报讯训练班同学
    倪宗堂等捉住潜逃的特务编辑同志：
    邮电部报讯训练班同学倪宗堂、胡寿熹等，警惕性很高，捉住了从天津潜逃到北京来的特务曾振华。
    五月十四日晚上八点三刻左右，报讯训练班的同学们正在进行文化娱乐活动，有人来找倪宗堂、胡寿熹。他们出去一看，原是天津电信局的曾振华（递报员）。曾振华支支吾吾地说，他已经离职了，要到绥远去看姐姐，因为没有路费，想借些钱。倪宗堂、胡寿熹二同志听了便有些怀疑：“为什么这家伙不愿意作工作呢？可能有问题。”他们回到班里和大家商量。工会主任姚承康一听这个情况就说：“我们要提高警惕！先向天津电信局了解一下情况。”同学们立刻给天津邮电局挂长途电话，一面让两个人和曾振华谈话。
    时间快到十一点，天津电话来了，说：“曾振华在日伪时期，在宪兵队当过特务，害过人；国民党时期，又在电信局依势欺压工人。天津局职工在控诉会上检举了他，公安局要抓他，他逃跑了。请赶快扣起来。”同志们接到电话后，马上给北京市公安局打电话。等到公安员把反革命分子曾振华逮捕起来，大家才松了一口气。曾被捕时，还骂大家说：“我等了这么长时间借不到钱，原来你们在暗算我，这叫什么朋友？”没等他说完，大家都愤怒地指着他说：“谁和你是朋友？你是特务，你是我们的敌人！我们决不能放过你。”
