Beijing Suburban Cooperatives
Massively Pre-Purchase Cotton from Farmers

The Beijing suburban cooperatives are massively pre-purchasing cotton from farmers. Some farmers in the suburbs originally had concerns about growing cotton, fearing that they would not be able to sell the cotton after harvesting, or that they would not get a good price. The cooperatives paid attention to this situation, and started pre-purchasing large quantities of cotton from farmers in April, while explaining to them the principle of "patriotic prosperity through growing more cotton." This not only dispelled the farmers' concerns, but also solved many difficulties in their lives and production, so they all started growing more cotton!

The cotton purchase is mainly in the Nanyuan District. The production departments of the cooperatives in various villages in Nanyuan have already signed more than 5,400 contracts with farmers, pre-purchasing a total of 2.26 million jin of seed cotton. The crops in Zhiyuan Village have been flooded for two consecutive years, and many farmers lack food. Now, after receiving corn from the cooperative, they are determined to grow cotton well to repay the government. Some used the corn they received to buy farm tools, fertilizers, and livestock. The cotton fields in the entire Nanyuan District have now increased to more than 52,000 mu, an increase of 20,000 mu compared to last year.

There are also some biases in the pre-purchase of cotton. Some farmers sold the corn they received and squandered it on eating and drinking. Some received corn even though they did not grow cotton. The district and village governments and cooperatives should seriously check and correct this. (Xu Yiliang)

　　北京市郊区合作社
　  向农民大量预购棉花
    北京市郊区合作社正向农民大量预购棉花。郊区有些农民本来对种棉花有顾虑，怕棉花收下来卖不出去，或是卖不上好价钱。合作社注意了这个情况，从四月里就向农民预购了大量棉花，并向农民讲解“爱国发家，多种棉花”的道理。这样农民不但打消了顾虑，还解决了生活和生产中的许多困难，都多种起棉花来啦！
    购棉是以南苑区为主。南苑各村合作社生产部，已经和农民订了五千四百多份合同。共预购了籽棉二百二十六万斤。志远庄的庄稼连着两年都涝了，不少农民缺乏口粮，现在由合作社领到玉米后，都决心好好种棉，报答政府。有的用领到的玉米买了农具、肥料和牲口。南苑全区的棉田，现在已经增加到五万二千多亩，比去年多了两万亩。
    在预购棉花中，也有一些偏向。有的农民把领到的玉米变卖了，胡吃胡喝。还有的没有种棉也领到了玉米。各区、村政府及合作社，应该认真检查纠正。（徐亦良）
