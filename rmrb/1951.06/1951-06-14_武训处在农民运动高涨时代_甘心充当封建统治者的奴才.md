    Wu Xun Was in an Era of Rising Peasant Movements,
　　Willing to Be a Lackey of the Feudal Rulers
To the Editor:
    The criticism and discussion of "The Story of Wu Xun" should also analyze specific historical materials more. According to incomplete materials in the "A Brief Account of Military Campaigns in Shandong," I found that in Wu Xun's youth and middle age, at least three earth-shattering peasant uprisings occurred in northwestern Shandong, where he lived and was active.
    The first peasant uprising began in the fourth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty (1854 AD, when Wu Xun was 16 years old) and lasted for 16 months. At that time, the Taiping Army leaders Huang Shengcai, Zeng Lichang, Chen Shibao, Xu Zongyang, and others led their troops from northern Anhui through northwestern Shandong into Zhili to aid the Taiping Army led by Lin Fengxiang and Li Kaifang, who were surrounded by the Qing general Senggelinqin in Fucheng. This army successively conquered Yanggu, Shenxian, Guanxian, and Chaocheng, and stationed in Linqing Prefecture for ten days. From the "official" records of the rulers at the time, it can be seen that the local people warmly welcomed and actively participated in the Taiping Army. The people not only did not respond to the rulers' call to repair the city, but instead helped the old and the young out of the city to greet the Taiping Army, trampling the city wall gaps into wide thoroughfares. According to the records, among the Qing soldiers' captives, in addition to the "long-haired old bandits" and "those speaking with a southern accent," there were more "accomplices" or "those who were coerced," who were obviously local people who participated in the uprising.
    In May and June of the same year (the fourth year of Xianfeng), the Lin and Li troops once went south to Gaotang Prefecture in Shandong Province and stationed there for half a year. The Qing soldiers did not dare to invade. It was not until the battle of Dongxi Lianzhen occurred in the first month of the following year. In June, the battle of Feng Guancun in Chiping County occurred again. The Taiping Army suffered losses, and the two leaders, Lin Fengxiang and Li Kaifang, died heroically. By this time, the feudal order in northwestern Shandong slowly began to recover.
    The second was the uprising of peasants, religious sects, salt workers, and salt merchants in northwestern Shandong, which occurred from February to November in the eleventh year of Xianfeng (1861 AD). (At this time, Wu Xun was 23 years old and had already "resolved to beg for alms to establish schools.") The insurgents were quite well-organized, holding yellow, white, green, red, and black flags. Initially, there were about five or six groups, each with over a thousand people, fighting in the villages of Shenxian, Tangyi, Guanxian, and Guantao counties. Wu Xun's hometown was precisely a "shortcut for bandits to come and go." The insurgents were very popular among the people. The "official" records also said that "those who followed the rebellion returned as if to their homes." The "government troops" at the time were very embarrassed, such as in Qiuxian County, where "more than ten defending soldiers had not been paid for a year, and they were like beggars; the recruited militia had not been issued salt and grain for five days, and they were about to collapse and disintegrate." Later, the reactionary rulers bought off some traitors in the insurgent army, and slowly suppressed the uprising people.
    The third peasant uprising occurred in the seventh year of Tongzhi (1868 AD), when Wu Xun was 30 years old. Zhang Zongyu, a famous leader of the Western Nian Army, led his troops into northwestern Shandong in March of the seventh year of Tongzhi, fighting in Dongchang, Chiping, Yucheng, Lingxian, Linyi, Jiyang, and Wuding areas. The people of northwestern Shandong enthusiastically participated in the insurgent army and supplied a large amount of food and grass to the insurgent army.
    Wu Xun was completely unconcerned and resisted these peasant uprisings. He was willing to be a lackey of the feudal ruling class. Isn't this very obvious? I provide these materials to aid everyone's research.
    Sincerely,
                                Zhao Lisheng

### 武训处在农民运动高涨时代　甘心充当封建统治者的奴才

    武训处在农民运动高涨时代
　　甘心充当封建统治者的奴才编辑同志：
    关于《武训传》的批判与讨论，还应该多分析具体的历史材料。我根据《山东军兴记略》中的不完全材料，发现在武训的青年和中年时代，在他生活与活动的鲁西北，至少发生过三次轰天动地的农民起义。
    第一次农民起义，开始于清咸丰四年（公元一八五四年，武训正十六岁），共持续十六个月。那时，太平军领袖黄生才、曾立昌、陈世保、许宗扬等率部自皖北出发经鲁西北入直隶，援助被清将僧格林沁包围在阜城的太平军林凤祥、李开芳部。这支军队连续攻克阳谷、莘县、冠县、朝城，并在临清州驻扎十日。从当时统治者的“官”方记载中，可以看到当地人民都热烈欢迎并纷纷参加太平军。人民不仅不响应统治者的修城号召，反而扶老携幼出城迎接太平军，把城墙缺口踏成广衢。根据记载，清兵的俘虏中，除“长发老贼”“操南音者”外，还有更多的“胁从者”或“被裹者”，那显然是当地参加起义的人民。
    同年（咸丰四年）五、六月间，林、李部队曾南下山东境内高唐州，驻扎半年，清兵不敢侵犯。直到第二年正月，发生了东西连镇战役。夏六月又发生了茌平县冯官屯战役。太平军遭受损失，林凤祥、李开芳二领袖都壮烈牺牲。到这时候，鲁西北的封建统治秩序才慢慢恢复起来。
    第二次是鲁西北农民、教门和盐丁、盐贩的起义，发生于咸丰十一年（公元一八六一）二月到十一月。（这时武训二十三岁，已经“立志行乞兴学”了。）起义者的组织相当整齐，执黄、白、绿、红、黑等旗号。起初大约有五六股，每股千余人，转战莘县、堂邑、冠县、馆陶诸县乡村。武训的故乡恰是“匪众往来捷径”。起义者很得人民拥护，“官”方记载也说是“从乱者如归”。当时的“官兵”是很狼狈的，如邱县“守兵十余名，一年无饷，形同乞丐；所募民勇，五日未发盐粮，势将溃散，无不解体。”后来，反动统治者收买了起义军中一部分变节者，才慢慢把起义人民镇压下去。
    第三次农民起义发生于同治七年（公元一八六八），当时武训年三十岁。西捻军著名领袖张总愚率部于同治七年三月进入鲁西北地区，转战于东昌、茌平、禹城、陵县、临邑、济阳、武定一带，鲁西北人民踊跃参加起义军，大量供应起义军粮草。
    武训对这些农民起义运动是毫不关心的，是抗拒的。他甘心做封建统治阶级的奴才，这难道不是十分明显的吗？我提供这些材料，以助大家的研究。
    此致敬礼                                赵俪生
