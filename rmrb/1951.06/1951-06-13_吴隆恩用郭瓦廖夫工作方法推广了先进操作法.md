　　Wu Longen Promotes Advanced Operating Methods Using Kovalev's Working Method
　　Cui Chengwu
    Since last year, Wu Longen, the director of the assembly workshop in the Machine Three Factory, has been struggling with an old problem. That is, how to enable the slower-working comrades to catch up with the faster ones and ensure that production tasks are completed on time or ahead of schedule every month? In January and February of this year, technical worker Jie Qide could easily assemble twelve or thirteen chassis a day. Li Sheng was also a technical worker, but even ran to the toilet, yet he could only assemble one a day. Wu Longen thought: the difference in work speed is so great, there must be a problem with the operating method. So he asked Jie Qide to introduce the secrets to working fast to everyone. However, after the meeting, the production situation did not change at all. Where are the secrets? No one learned anything. One time didn't work, so they tried a second time, but the result was still the same.

    On March 13th, Wu Longen saw two articles and an editorial in the newspaper promoting the Kovalev working method, and felt that this method might solve his problem. But would it really work? One day, he thought about it from midnight until dawn, and then he was sure that the Kovalev working method could definitely be used in the assembly shop. The next day, he put forward his opinion and consulted with the chairman of the trade union and the secretary of the Communist Party branch. They all agreed, and then a working group was established to specifically lead the work of promoting the Kovalev working method. However, when the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Party branch called on everyone to learn the Kovalev working method, some workers expressed reluctance to accept it. Li Sheng said, "What 'Kovalev' this or 'Kovalev' that, 'advanced' or not 'advanced,' anyway, you can't get the job done without putting in effort!" Yao Yongkai said, "How can there be advanced experience in our assembly shop? Isn't Jie Qide's way of doing things the same as ours?! He does it fast, probably because the parts he gets are good and the tools fit his hand!"

    As the night shift was about to end, Wu Longen found five workers, including Jie Qide, who assembled chassis the fastest, and held a small meeting to explain to them what the Kovalev working method was and what its benefits were. These five people were all very willing to do it. That night, Wu Longen, together with the technicians, conducted technical measurements for them, recorded in detail the advantages of each person's operation, and after research, formulated a preliminary operating method. This preliminary operating method was reviewed and approved by the chief engineer and printed into a booklet.

    After the booklet was distributed, the workers still didn't trust it. Some said, "These rules are written in a very decent way, but I can't guarantee whether they are applicable. Besides, I'm used to the old rules, it's too much trouble to come up with a new set!" Some said, "I think this method is similar to mine, filing still has to be done, jamming still has to be done, and no procedures are reduced. How can it improve efficiency?" Li Sheng was even more unconvinced. He thought, "I, Li Sheng, have been assembling machines for so many years and have never submitted to anyone. How can I bow my head to others this time?" So he tried hard to increase his output, and worked all day without wiping his sweat. Sure enough, he assembled one more than usual. However, when the inspector checked, they were all returned because the quality was not up to standard. Li Sheng was furious and threw the work on the table: "If this thing were mine, I would smash it!"

    When Wu Longen saw that the workers still had such big ideological problems, he decided to use practical examples to conduct education. While he let Jie Qide practice the new operating method, he and the technician raised every action of the new operating method to a theoretical level for research. After starting work, he called the workers together, had Jie Qide perform, and he and the technician gave theoretical explanations. Li Sheng saw that there were many places that were different from his own method. People meticulously filed all the parts before assembly, and removed all the burrs in the important places. Once assembled, it was successful. What about himself? He deburred while assembling. The deburring was rough, and there were always problems when assembling, so he had to disassemble and file it twice. Sometimes the filing was not suitable, and he had to disassemble it again. But he was not completely convinced. He thought, "This is doing it slowly, I'm not sure what it would be like if it was done quickly." It wasn't until he saw Jie Qide assemble a chassis in forty minutes and there was nothing wrong with it that Li Sheng was convinced and kept saying, "This method is really good! This method is really good!" Yao Yongkai, who previously thought that there was no advanced experience in the assembly shop, also said, "It is true that many people produce sages, and this good method has been developed!"

    The day after the performance, all the workers in the workshop started to work according to the new operating method, and the production efficiency did increase. Li Sheng used to be able to do one at ten or eleven o'clock, but this time it only took one thirty.

    After working for two days, another disturbance arose among the workers. Some workers were afraid that the administration would change the quota after the production increased, so they held back and dared not work. After Wu Longen understood this situation, he immediately explained, "Changing the quota takes a certain amount of time. How can it be changed casually as soon as the output increases?" Everyone felt confident and started working boldly again. In eight days, the output of the entire workshop tripled. Wages also rose (they were on a piece-rate wage system). Li Sheng's group had not even been able to get the basic wage before. After learning the new operating method, the output increased eightfold, and the wage was more than three times higher than the basic wage.

### 吴隆恩用郭瓦廖夫工作方法推广了先进操作法

　　吴隆恩用郭瓦廖夫工作方法推广了先进操作法
　　崔诚五
    机器三厂装配场车间主任吴隆恩从去年以来有个老问题想不出办法解决。这就是怎样使干活慢的工友赶上干活快的，保证月月都能按期或者提前完成生产任务呢？今年一、二月间，技术工人解启德一天可以从容不迫地装十二、三个机箱。李盛也是技术工人，但是连上便所都带小跑，每天却只能装一个。吴隆恩想：做活快慢差这么远，一定是操作法上有问题。于是他就让解启德向大家介绍做活快的窍门。可是开过会以后，生产情况一点没变。窍门在那里？谁也没有学到。一次不行，又来第二次，结果还是照旧。
    三月十三日，吴隆恩看见报上登了推广郭瓦廖夫工作法的两篇文章和一篇社论，觉得这个办法也许能解决自己的问题。但是，到底行不行呢？有一天，他从半夜一直想到天亮，才肯定郭瓦廖夫工作法在装配场一定能用上。第二天他提出他的意见和工会主席、中共支部书记商量。他们都同意了，接着就成立了一个工作组，专门领导推广郭瓦廖夫工作方法的工作。可是，当行政、工会、中共支部号召大家学习郭瓦廖夫工作方法时，有些工人却表示不愿意接受。李盛说：“什么‘廖夫’不‘廖夫’，‘先进’不‘先进’的，反正不使劲，干不出活来！”姚永凯说：“我们装配场那还有先进经验哪？解启德的干法还不和我们一样？！他干的快，恐怕是因为摊的部件好，工具合手！”
    快下夜班时，吴隆恩便找装机箱最快的解启德等五个工人，开了个小会，向他们讲解什么是郭瓦廖夫工作方法，有那些好处。这五个人一听都很愿意干。当天晚上，吴隆恩就会同技术员给他们作了技术测定，详细记录了每人操作上的优点，经过研究，制订了一个初步的操作法。这个初步的操作法经总工程师审阅批准后，印成了小册子。
    小册子发下以后，工人还不信任。有的说：“这些条条订得倒很像样；能不能适用可不敢担保。再说老规矩都干顺手了，另来一套新的多麻烦！”有的说：“我看这个干法和我的差不多，锉还得锉，卡还得卡，一样手续也没有少，打那去提高效率？”李盛更不服气，他想：“我李盛装机器这么些年，从来没服过谁，这回怎么能向别人低头？”于是他努力地提高自己的产量，没擦汗地干了一天，果然比往常多装了一个。可是检查员一检查，全给退了回来，因为质量不合规格。李盛气坏了，把活往案上一摔：“这玩艺若是我的，就把它砸啦！”
    吴隆恩一看工友思想上还有这么大的问题，就决定用实际例子来进行教育。他一边让解启德练习新的操作法，一边和技术员把新操作法的每一个动作都提到理论上来研究。上班后，他就把工友召集到一起，由解启德表演，自己和技术员作理论讲解。李盛一看：有很多地方和自己的干法不一样。人家在装配前就把部件全部精细地锉了一遍，把要紧地方的毛头打得一干二净，一装就成功。自己呢？一边装配一边打刺，打得又粗糙，装上总有毛病，只好拆开再锉两下，有时锉得不合适，还得再拆开。但是他还不完全服气。他想：“这是慢慢做，如果快做可不一定怎么样。”直到眼看解启德四十分钟装一个机箱，并且一点毛病没有的时候，李盛才心服口服了，不住口地说：“这个干法真好！这个干法真好！”以前认为装配场没有先进经验的姚永凯也说：“真是人多出圣贤，搞出来这一套好办法！”
    表演后第二天，全场工友都按新操作方法做开了，生产效率果然提高。李盛过去十来点钟才能做一个，这回只用一点三十分。
    干了两天，工友当中又起风波了。有些工友怕生产提高后，行政改变定额，就缩手缩脚不敢干了。吴隆恩了解这种情况后马上解释说：“改变定额是有一定时间的，那能产量刚提高就随便改变呢？”大家心里有了底，又大胆地干起来。八天工夫，全场产量就提高了三倍。工资也涨了（他们是计件工资制）。李盛那组以前还得不到基本工资数，学习新操作方法后，产量提高了八倍，工资就比基本工资高出三倍多。
