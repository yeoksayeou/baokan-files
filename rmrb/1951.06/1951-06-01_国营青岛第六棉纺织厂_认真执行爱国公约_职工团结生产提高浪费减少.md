State-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory
    Conscientiously Implements Patriotic Pledges
    Workers Unite to Improve Production and Reduce Waste
    Based on a high level of patriotic ideological awareness, all employees of the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory universally established patriotic pledges from the team level to the whole factory at the end of March. Since their implementation began in April, significant achievements have been made in improving production, enhancing technology, promoting unity and mutual assistance, and improving work attitude.
    In terms of increasing production and reducing waste, the focus in April was on eliminating substandard cloth and consolidating the achievements in reducing cotton waste. In April, the average substandard cloth rate for the entire factory was 1.78% of total output (compared to 3.28% in March), and cotton waste accounted for 0.895% of total output (compared to 0.798 pounds in March, due to the poorer quality of raw cotton in April). In terms of conservation, for example, in the fourth week of April, the No.1 Electrical B shift in the power department saved over 60% of the average actual coal and electricity consumption. Under the slogan of "finding experience and setting examples," many teams included clauses in their patriotic pledges about "learning from strengths and making up for weaknesses." The patriotic pledges of various teams in the spinning department all included the requirement to "learn from the Hao Jianxiu work method" (Hao Jianxiu was a female spinner in the factory who grasped the key link of doing a good job in cleaning and created a record of an average daily cotton waste rate of 0.12%). People were then sent in shifts to learn from Hao Jianxiu’s machine. The repair department subscribed to more than 20 technical magazines, and Xue Yuntian, an elderly worker in his seventies, enthusiastically participated in technical theory studies. After the establishment of the patriotic pledges, workers in all areas of the factory automatically formed mutual aid groups, demonstrating the spirit of "promoting each other, learning from each other, helping each other, and supervising each other." For example, in the Hao Kecheng area of the weaving department, 27 people formed five mutual aid groups, and short-term competitions were launched between the groups. The average substandard cloth rate in this area in April was 0.36%. In the past, workers in the weaving department often complained loudly to the preparation department, which made the preparation department unhappy. After the establishment of the patriotic pledges, the female workers in the preparation department specifically wrote a guarantee to the weaving department, promising to do a good job. The female workers in the weaving department also organized a Yangko dance team to send a guarantee to the preparation department, promising to reduce substandard cloth and not let down the patriotic enthusiasm of their sisters in the preparation department. Workers consciously checked their work attitude based on the labor pledges established by the workshops. Over 90% of the female workers did not comb their hair during work hours to ensure the implementation of the labor pledges.
    The reason why the patriotic pledges of the Sixth Factory can play a role is mainly due to the fact that the factory's leading cadres, on the basis of patriotic education, conducted in-depth education on the relevant patriotic pledges, explained the principles clearly, pointed out the direction, and taught methods. The heads of each trade union team went deep into the masses to discuss, so as to avoid the cadres taking over everything. The factory trade union committee also selected typical teams to help them formulate patriotic pledges, create experience, and promote it throughout the factory. Therefore, the content of the factory's patriotic pledges is practical and closely related to the workers. After the formulation of the patriotic pledges, the factory trade union also systematically mobilized the workers to consciously check each other and supervise the implementation of the patriotic pledges. The trade union issued a "Record Form for Individuals in Teams to Implement the Patriotic Pledges." The results of the pilot implementation of this method were very good. Workers were able to consciously check and record their own shortcomings, and care about recording the advantages and disadvantages of others. This inspection method is now being promoted throughout the factory.

### 国营青岛第六棉纺织厂  认真执行爱国公约  职工团结生产提高浪费减少

　　国营青岛第六棉纺织厂
    认真执行爱国公约
    职工团结生产提高浪费减少
    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂全体职工在高度的爱国主义思想觉悟基础上，于三月底从小组到全厂普遍订立了爱国公约。四月份开始执行以来，在改进生产、提高技术、团结互助、劳动态度等方面，都有显著成就。
    在提高生产减少浪费方面，四月份重点是放在消灭次布和巩固减少白花的成绩上。四月份全厂平均次布率占总产量百分之一点七八（三月份为百分之三点二八），白花占总产量百分之零点八九五（三月份为百分之零点七九八磅，因四月份原棉品质较差）。在节约方面，如原电丙班运转四月份第四周省煤省电均超过普通实际用煤用电的百分之六十。在“找经验，树榜样”的口号下，不少小组都在爱国公约上订有“学长补短”的条文。纺部各组的爱国公约上都订着要“学习郝建秀工作法”（郝建秀是该厂细纱女工，她在工作中抓住了作好清洁工作这一主要环节，创造了每天平均白花率百分之零点一二的纪录。），随后即轮流抽人到郝建秀车旁去学习。修机部新订了二十多种技术杂志，七十多岁的老工友薛云田也热烈地参加了技术理论学习。订立了爱国公约后，全厂各区工友都自动结合组成了互助组，发挥了“互相推动，互相学习，互相帮助，互相监督”的精神。如织部郝克诚区，二十七人组成五个互助组，组与组间挑起短期竞赛，该区四月份的次布率平均为百分之零点三六。过去织部工友常常脸红脖子粗地向准备部提意见，准备部为这也老不高兴；订立爱国公约后，准备部女工特地写了保证书送到织部去，保证一定作好工作；织部女工也组织了秧歌队，送保证书到准备部去，保证少出次布，决不辜负准备部姊妹的爱国热情。工人群众都根据车间订立的劳动公约自觉地检查自己的劳动态度。百分之九十以上女工为了保证劳动公约的实现，工作时间不梳头。
    六厂的爱国公约所以能发挥作用，主要是由于：该厂领导干部在爱国教育的基础上，深入进行了有关爱国公约的教育，讲清道理，指明方向，教给办法。各工会小组长深入和群众商量，以免干部包办代替。厂工会委员会又选择了典型小组，帮助他们制订爱国公约，创造经验，向全厂推广。因之，该厂爱国公约的内容切合实际，和工人群众息息相关。爱国公约制订后该厂工会又有计划地发动工人，自觉地互相检查，监督爱国公约的执行。工会曾印发了一种“小组个人执行爱国公约记录表”。这个方法重点试行的成绩很好，工友们都能自觉检查记录自己的缺点，并关心记录别人的优缺点，这种检查办法现正在全厂推广实施。
