　　Studying and Implementing Chairman Mao's Educational Thought
    ——Written to Commemorate the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China
       Qian Junrui
    I.

　　The instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, on education work must be profoundly understood by every educator.

　　Like his great teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Comrade Mao Zedong has always approached and solved problems according to the scientific principles of dialectical and historical materialism. He did the same with cultural and educational issues.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A given culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economy of a given society, and in turn exerts a great influence on the politics and economy of that society." Therefore, "The issue is very clear. The old culture of the Chinese nation that we want to eradicate cannot be separated from the old politics and old economy of the Chinese nation; and the new culture of the Chinese nation that we want to establish cannot be separated from the new politics and new economy of the Chinese nation. The old politics and old economy of the Chinese nation are the basis of the old culture of the Chinese nation; and the new politics and new economy of the Chinese nation are the basis of the new culture of the Chinese nation." ("On New Democracy").

　　What is the conclusion? It is that we must have revolution, not reformism, and certainly not surrenderism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "These ruling political, economic, and cultural forms are the objects of our revolution. What we want to eradicate are these colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal old political, old economic, and old cultural forms. And what we want to establish is the opposite of this, namely, the new politics, new economy, and new culture of the Chinese nation." ("On New Democracy"). This is the only correct Marxist proposition, and it is fundamentally different from all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reformism.

　　When there is revolution in the world, and people participate in the revolution, things become easier, and everything is hopeful. Among these, cultural and educational work will have real methods and real hope, and before the revolution is launched, our cultural and educational work should be, and can only be, to prepare ideologically for the revolution.

　　The Great Revolution of 1925-27 erupted, and the peasant movement in Hunan developed like a storm. Let us see how Comrade Mao Zedong observed and analyzed the cultural and educational work among the peasants at that time. He said: "Over ninety percent of the Chinese people are uncultured, and the vast majority of these are peasants. Once the forces of the exploiting classes in the countryside are overthrown, the peasants' cultural movement will begin. Look how peasants, who used to hate schools, are now working hard to run night schools." "Now they are vigorously running night schools, calling them 'Peasant Schools.' Some have already been established, and some are being prepared. On average, each township peasant association has a night school. They are very enthusiastic about running these night schools, believing that such night schools are truly their own." "As a result of the development of the peasant movement, the peasants' culture has naturally improved. In a short time, there will be thousands of schools springing up in the countryside throughout the province, unlike the intellectuals and so-called 'educators,' who shout empty slogans of 'universal education,' which remain mere empty words." ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"). He also said, "The popularity of political propaganda in the countryside is entirely due to the efforts of the peasant associations. Simple slogans, pictures, and speeches have made the peasants seem as if each one of them has attended a political school, with extremely broad and rapid results." He further said, "Could opening ten thousand law and political schools popularize political education among the men and women, old and young, in the remote countryside in such a short time, as the peasant associations are doing now? I think it is certainly impossible."

　　After 1927, the land revolution developed in the southern provinces. The peasants overthrew the landlord class, distributed the land, and established a large number of primary schools, night schools, literacy classes, and clubs. The clubs also had many committees such as "sports," "wall newspapers," and "evening parties." "The clubs all have new plays." After inspecting these works in Changgang Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Every township people's government should learn from the cultural and educational work of Changgang Township!" (Investigation of Changgang Township).

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the new cultural and educational movement in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas developed very widely and deeply. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The political and economic foundation of this culture is the elected government, rent reduction and interest reduction, and the individual economy led by factories of various scales and cooperatives of various forms." ("Speech at the Cultural and Educational Conference in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region"). Without this political and economic foundation, such a large-scale new cultural and educational work is impossible.

　　The victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution gave birth to the People's Republic of China, so that we can carry out the largest-scale people's education cause. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "With a people's state, the people have the possibility to educate and transform themselves democratically on a national scale and as a whole, to free themselves from the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very great and will exist for a long time, and cannot be quickly eliminated), to transform the bad habits and bad ideas they acquired from the old society, not to go down the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and to continue to advance towards socialist and communist society." ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship").

　　From this, it can be seen that only when the revolution is victorious, the "forces of the exploiting classes" are overthrown, and the people have a "people's state" and an "elected government," can the people's cultural and educational movement "begin" on a large scale, the people can educate and transform themselves on a national scale and as a whole, and can regard schools as "truly their own" schools.

　　From this, it can be seen that all so-called "education to save the country," "education is omnipotent," the reformist theory of the Social Democrats of "cultivating talents first, and then revolution," and the empty slogans of "universal education" in old China are nothing but "empty words." To put it more seriously, it would be appropriate to say that they are self-deceiving lies. Not to mention that the reactionary "Wu Xunism," which takes "asceticism" and "promoting education" as its banner, and implements unconditional surrender to feudalism, is even more despicable and shameful.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific view on cultural and educational issues is based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview of the Party, that is, dialectical materialism. He taught us: "Marx said: 'It is not social consciousness that determines social existence, but social existence that determines social consciousness.' He also said: 'Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.' This is the first scientific provision since human history that correctly resolves the relationship between consciousness and existence, and it is the basic starting point of the active revolutionary theory of reflection later profoundly developed by Lenin. We cannot forget this starting point when discussing Chinese cultural issues." ("On New Democracy").

　　Marx once said, "The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator himself needs educating. ... The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice." ("Theses on Feuerbach"). Marx and Engels said in another of their works: "In order to produce this communist consciousness on a mass scale, as well as for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew." (Marx and Engels, Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 4, page 60).

　　Lenin continued to develop this idea. He said, "Only in the long struggle, only in persistent practical activity in creating a new, communist society, do the workers themselves achieve this transformation. And it is not possible to separate themselves from their petty-bourgeois prejudices merely by orders or slogans" (Lenin, Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 25, page 247).

　　Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly developed Lenin's theory of reflection in his famous work "On Practice." He said, "Marxist philosophy holds that the most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world. In the Marxist view, theory is important, and its importance is fully manifested in Lenin's saying, 'Without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.' But Marxism values theory precisely and only because it can guide action." ("On Practice"). He also said, "The active function of knowledge manifests itself not only in the active leap from perceptual to rational knowledge, but—and this is more important—it must manifest itself in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice. The knowledge which grasps the laws of the world, must be redirected to the practice of changing the world, must be applied anew in the practice of production, in the practice of revolutionary class struggle and national struggle, and in the practice of scientific experiment." (Ibid.).

　　He taught us: "If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing reality" (Ibid.).

　　Therefore, first, we must have revolution, because without revolution, we cannot overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and we cannot have the basis for new culture and education;

　　Second, revolutionary theory, revolutionary culture and education, must be used to promote and guide revolutionary action, otherwise it has no value;

　　Third, workers and all the people must be educated and gain knowledge in the revolution, in the struggle to change the world, that is, in the practice of changing reality.

　　Therefore, is it not obvious that to talk about education in a vacuum, divorced from revolutionary practice, divorced from the practice of transforming the world, that is, changing reality, is nothing but empty talk and essentially lies?

  II.

　　The education of the new China after the victory of the revolution should be a people's education on a national scale and as a whole, that is, an education that serves the masses of the people and becomes an education that is "truly their own" for the masses of the people. This people's education is built on the basis of the people's politics and the people's economy. It is a reflection of the new politics and new economy, and at the same time, it promotes and guides the construction of the new politics and new economy with great force.

　　The people's education of new China is the product of the people's state. Through various specific movements (such as the Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and patriotic covenants) and various specific institutions (such as groups, schools, factories, and agencies), it has gradually become a huge undertaking on a national scale and as a whole. It is the broad front where the Chinese working class, through its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, educates itself and educates the entire people, frees itself from the influence of internal and external reactionaries, transforms the bad habits and bad ideas inherited from the old society, and continues to advance towards socialist and communist society.

　　Our people's country, at the present stage, is a country of people's democratic dictatorship, that is, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Chinese Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Our people's education should be a reflection of the basic situation of this country. This determines a series of issues such as the guiding ideology, object, content, and methods of our people's education.

　　The culture and education of the new China should be culture and education led by the working class. The leading ideology of the people's culture and people's education in the new China should be and can only be the thought of the proletariat, and should not be and must not be the thought of any other class. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The so-called new-democratic culture is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal culture of the masses of the people... This culture can only be led by the cultural thought of the proletariat, that is, communist thought, and the cultural thought of any other class cannot lead it. In a word, the so-called new-democratic culture is 'an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal culture of the masses of the people led by the proletariat.'" ("On New Democracy").

　　Why must the people's culture and education be led by the thought of the proletariat, and not by the thought of any other class? This is because "with the development of society to the present era, the responsibility of correctly understanding and transforming world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party" ("On Practice"); it is "because only the working class is the most far-sighted, selfless, and revolutionary to the end. The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail. With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be successful. In the era of imperialism, no other class in any country can lead any real revolution to victory. The petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie of China have led revolutions many times, and they have all failed, which is clear evidence" ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship").

　　The proletarian thought we are talking about is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "At present, there is no doubt that we should expand the propaganda of communist thought and intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without this propaganda and study, we will not only be unable to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also unable to guide the current democratic revolution to victory." ("On New Democracy").

　　Now, due to the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, our people's democratic revolution has been victorious. The people of China are now applauding and sincerely welcoming this Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and everyone is enthusiastically asking to learn this Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Our responsibility is to educate the entire people on a national scale and as a whole, using the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, while educating ourselves, first of all to free ourselves from the influence of internal and external reactionaries, that is, to eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and at the same time "transform the bad habits and bad ideas we acquired from the old society," which also includes all kinds of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois bad habits and bad ideas. We should adopt a firm opposition and elimination policy towards the ideological influence of internal and external reactionaries, that is, towards feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "All slavish, feudal, and fascist culture and education should be eliminated by appropriate but firm steps." ("On Coalition Government"). He also said: "This kind of reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal classes and should be overthrown. Without overthrowing this kind of thing, no new culture can be established. No destruction, no construction; no damming, no flow; no stopping, no movement. The struggle between them is a life-and-death struggle." ("On New Democracy"). At the present stage, we should adopt the method of criticism and democratic debate to criticize the bad elements in the ideas of the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the peasants, because these elements are detrimental to the motherland and the people.

　　The people's education of the new China must be the education of the masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This new-democratic culture is popular, and therefore democratic. It should serve the working people, peasants, and laborers, who make up more than ninety percent of the nation, and gradually become their culture." ("On New Democracy"). Why? Because "the basis of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, mainly the alliance of workers and peasants, because these two classes account for eighty to ninety percent of the Chinese population. The overthrow of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly relied on the power of these two classes. The transition from new democracy to socialism mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes." ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship").

　　Therefore, our education must first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers (soldiers are armed workers and peasants).

　　All our educators must first solve this problem of "serving whom." This is a matter of standpoint, and it is a fundamental issue. If this problem is not well resolved among our many educators, our people's education will be difficult to advance smoothly.

　　Some people say that no one wants to serve imperialism anymore. But in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, in handling the work of cultural and educational institutions that accepted American subsidies, have some people not revealed illusions about imperialism, especially American imperialism, and varying degrees of nostalgia?

　　Some people say that no one wants to serve feudalism anymore. But when the film "Wu Xun Zhuan," which completely promoted surrender to feudalism, came out, did many educators, including some Communist Party members, applaud and surrender, raising their hands as prisoners?

　　Some people say that no one is serving the Kuomintang reactionaries anymore. But have some people who have worked obediently for a long time in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang not fully recognized their past mistakes?

　　Some people say that no one is serving the bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie first, but are there still quite a few educators who lack interest in and show indifference to the policy of opening schools to workers, peasants, and soldiers?

　　Our people's education must first be for workers, peasants, and soldiers, second for the petty bourgeoisie, and third for other patriotic democratic strata. Many of our educators have not yet solved this problem of "for whom," or have not solved it well. But this problem must be solved clearly and thoroughly. A passage from Comrade Mao Zedong about literary and art workers is equally applicable to our educators. He said: "No matter how long it takes, we must solve it, and we must solve it clearly and thoroughly. Our literary and art workers must accomplish this task, must move their butts over, and must gradually move over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the process of going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and going deep into actual struggles, in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying society. Only in this way can we have truly literary and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"). We should say that today our educators can only have truly education for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and truly people's education, if they seriously and solemnly overcome the bourgeois objectiveist thinking, correct their position, adopt a fully responsible attitude towards the motherland and the people, and truly stand on the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　This is the key issue for us to reform the old education and develop people's education today. All educators in the new China should be vigilant about this and pay serious attention to it. The discussions about the film "Wu Xun Zhuan" and the "Wu Xun spirit" that we are carrying out in various places will help solve this fundamental problem. Everyone should seize this link and relate it to their specific positions.

　　In our specific work, we should focus on striving for the popularization of education for workers, peasants, soldiers, and their children. In the work of cultivating talents for national construction, we should pay extra attention to absorbing outstanding industrial workers, agricultural labor models, and cadres who have participated in the revolution for a long time, to study science and technology in various schools, and cultivate them to become the strong backbone of the construction talents of the new China. If we fail to do so, we will make a political mistake.

  III.

　　The people's education of the new China at the present stage is a new-democratic education, that is, an education that is national, scientific, and popular, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　This people's education is national. "It is against imperialist oppression and advocates the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation. It belongs to our nation and has the characteristics of our nation." ("On New Democracy"). This education is the education of people's patriotism. Promoting a high degree of patriotism combined with internationalism is a major responsibility of all educators of the new China.

　　The Chinese people's patriotism is a great driving force for the Chinese people to complete their cause of liberation and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China. It has a strong economic, political, and ideological foundation.

　　The economic basis of our people's patriotism is the Chinese people's economy, which is led by the socialist state-owned economy and includes the division of labor and cooperation of five social economic components, each doing its best. This people's economy is growing stronger with the development of our country's industrialization, and gradually increasing the socialist economic components until it reaches socialism in the future. This guarantees the solid unity and firm progress of the people of the motherland in economic life.

　　The political basis of our people's patriotism is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and domestic ethnic groups. The purpose of this people's democratic dictatorship is to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength. The strong unity of the democratic classes and domestic ethnic groups in our country is an important source of strength for our patriotism.

　　The ideological basis of our people's patriotism is the great Mao Zedong Thought—the thought of the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and Chinese revolutionary practice. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most complete patriotic thought that thoroughly and fully represents the interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest patriot unprecedented in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong himself is the most complete and most satisfying embodiment of our great motherland and great people. Whether in the new-democratic stage or in the future socialist stage, patriotism is one of the most important aspects of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, loving the motherland is inseparable from loving Chairman Mao, and promoting patriotism is fundamentally inseparable from studying and implementing Mao Zedong Thought. This is why our patriotism has endless power in thought.

　　The purpose of carrying out patriotic education is to implement this patriotism with a strong foundation into children, youths, and the masses of the people, so that they have a high degree of national self-esteem and self-confidence, so that they love the motherland, closely link themselves with the destiny of the motherland, so that they love the people, fully trust the power of the people, and deeply hate the enemies of the people, so that they can sacrifice personal interests until the last drop of blood for the interests and glory of the motherland.

　　In order to achieve the above goals, our patriotic education should include the following main contents:

　　(1) The glorious and great history of our motherland, especially the struggles and creations of the masses of the people.

　　(2) Resolutely oppose imperialist aggression and the oppression of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, resolutely oppose national inferiority and dependence, and promote national self-esteem and self-confidence.

　　(3) The new China is more glorious and great than any period in the history of the motherland. It is the fruit of the people's long-term struggle. We must resolutely defend this victory, defend the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty, and prevent it from being violated.

　　(4) Support new democracy, support the Common Program, consolidate and expand the people's democratic dictatorship, and build a new China with a high degree of enthusiasm and loyalty, using all knowledge and skills.

　　(5) Love labor, love the people, and protect public property.

　　(6) Support the Chinese Communist Party, support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and love the great Chairman Mao.

　　(7) Support the internationalist alliance between China and the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the working people of the world.

　　(8) Insist on progress, oppose backwardness, and be determined to strive for a better future than new democracy, that is, the future of socialism and communism.

　　When carrying out patriotic education, we must be good at using fresh facts, such as the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the achievements of various constructions, to improve the understanding of young people, children, and workers and peasants through certain extracurricular activities, using and organizing their own experiences, and lead them to a higher level of patriotism. On the other hand, we must implement patriotic education in various disciplines.

　　This people's education is scientific. "It is against all feudal ideas and superstitious ideas, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the unity of theory and practice." ("On New Democracy"). Therefore, our educators must first seriously study dialectical materialism and historical materialism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice," and then systematically and popularly publicize materialism, publicize "On Practice," and integrate this universal scientific truth into the various courses of the school. This is a basic task of our educators. We must learn and impart the latest achievements in modern science and technology, closely link them with the construction of the new China, and serve this construction. Our task is to make the country industrialized in a scientific direction and to equip everyone with a scientific worldview.

　　This people's education is popular. As mentioned above, we should first popularize cultural, scientific, and political education to workers, peasants, and soldiers. The establishment of a people's democratic dictatorship creates the premise for truly and not verbally or fantastically popularizing education. The content of this popular education correctly reflects the people's democratic politics and economy, and can promote this politics and economy, that is, the content needed by the masses of the people. Its form is also acceptable to the masses of the people and not the "annoying" form that Comrade Mao Zedong criticized. The content and form of this popular education will gradually improve. Here, the problem of popularization and improvement in education work arises. Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of correctly combining popularization and improvement, which he instructed for literary and art work, is fully applicable to the work of people's education. He taught us: "The problem now facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers is that they are engaged in a brutal struggle with the enemy, and because of the long-term rule of the feudal and bourgeois classes, they are illiterate, ignorant, and uncultured. Therefore, their urgent demand is to carry out a universal enlightenment movement for them with the cultural knowledge and literary and art works that they urgently need and can quickly accept, to improve their enthusiasm for struggle and confidence in victory, and to strengthen their unity, so that they can fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind. ... Therefore, for the people, the first step, the most serious and central task, is popularization, not improvement. The attitude of neglecting and ignoring popularization work is wrong." He pointed out: "Eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for building a new China." ("On Coalition Government") He also said: "The people demand popularization, and then they demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month. Here, popularization is the popularization of the people, and improvement is also the improvement of the people, and this improvement is not improvement in the air, not improvement behind closed doors, but improvement on the basis of popularization. This improvement is determined by popularization and at the same time gives guidance to popularization. ... Therefore, our improvement is improvement on the basis of popularization, and our popularization is popularization under the guidance of improvement." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"). This dialectical combination of popularization and improvement is the law of development of people's education in the new China.

  IV.

　　Since the education of the new China is led by the thought of the working class, it must be guided by the viewpoints and thought methods of the working class. Therefore, the method of new-democratic education should be a method that unifies theory and practice. Why? Stalin said: "The connection between science and practical activity, the connection between theory and practice, and their unity should become the compass of the proletarian party." ("Dialectical and Historical Materialism").

　　Lenin once strongly criticized one of the basic characteristics of bourgeois old education, which is the disconnection between theory and practice. He said: "One of the greatest misfortunes left to us by the old, capitalist society is the complete divorce of book from practical work." ("The Tasks of the Youth Leagues"). As early as twenty-six years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong saw the irrationality of this old education. He said: "When I was studying in school, I saw the peasants opposing the 'foreign school,' and I agreed with the general 'foreign students' and 'foreign teachers,' standing on the interests of the foreign school, and I always felt that the peasants were 'ignorant and hateful.' I lived in the countryside for half a year in the 14th year of the Republic of China, and then I understood that I was wrong, and the peasants' reasoning was extremely correct. The teaching materials of rural primary schools are all about things in the city, which do not meet the needs of the countryside; and the attitude of primary school teachers towards the peasants is very bad. They are not the helpers of the peasants, but have become what the peasants hate." ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan").

　　Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently adhered to the principle of unifying theory and practice, and opposes dogmatism and empiricism. He once said in 1938: "The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is a theory that is 'applicable everywhere.' It is not to regard their theory as dogma, but as a guide to action. It is not to learn the letters of Marxism-Leninism, but to learn their position and method of observing and solving problems. Only this guide to action, only this position and method, is revolutionary science, and only this is the only correct policy for guiding us to understand the revolutionary object and guiding revolutionary action." ("The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War").

　　On May 19, 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong specifically gave a speech entitled "Reform Our Study." He severely criticized the anti-scientific subjective methodology in our learning methods and learning systems. He said: "They violated a basic principle that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have repeatedly warned people: the unity of theory and practice. Since they violated this principle of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, they themselves created a contrary principle: the separation of theory and practice. In school education, in the education of on-the-job cadres, those who teach philosophy do not guide students to study the logic of the Chinese revolution, those who teach economics do not guide students to study the characteristics of the Chinese economy, those who teach political science do not guide students to study the strategies of the Chinese revolution, those who teach military science do not guide students to study the characteristics of the Chinese military, and so on. As a result, false ideas are spread, and young people are misled." He also said, "In short, this anti-scientific and anti-Marxist subjective methodology is a great enemy of the Communist Party, a great enemy of the proletariat, a great enemy of the people, a great enemy of the nation, and a manifestation of impure Party spirit. With a great enemy at hand, we have the necessity to defeat it. ... Without a scientific attitude or without a complete scientific attitude, that is to say, without or without a complete attitude of the unity of Marxist theory and practice, it is called no Party spirit, or called incomplete Party spirit."

　　At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong specifically proposed the following suggestions: First, systematically and carefully study the surrounding environment, that is, conduct investigation and research on actual things. Second, analytically and comprehensively study the history of China in the past 100 years. Third, the education of on-the-job cadres and school cadres should focus on studying the practical problems of the Chinese revolution, and start from this to study Marxism-Leninism, and abolish the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation.

　　In 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong also advocated and led the movement to rectify the three styles. He listed opposing subjectivism to rectify the style of study as the "first important issue" of rectification. He called on all comrades to "learn to use the position, viewpoint, and thought method of Marxism-Leninism to seriously study the history of China, study China's economy, politics, military, and culture, conduct investigation and research on each issue, and then create theory." He called on "those who have book knowledge to develop in the direction of practice, so that they can not stop in books, and can not commit the mistake of dogmatism. Those who have work experience should learn in the direction of theory, and should seriously read books, so that experience can be systematic, comprehensive, rise to theory, so that they can not mistakenly regard partial experience as universal truth, and can not commit the mistake of empiricism" ("Rectify the Styles of Study, Party, and Literature").

　　In the past ten years, the broad masses of Party members and cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and the staff in various aspects of the new China have followed these instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, reformed their study, corrected their position, viewpoint, and thought methods, and achieved brilliant results, greatly accelerating the victory of the revolution.

　　After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people's education of the new China also followed the policy instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, with the principle of unifying theory and practice, reforming the old education, developing the new people's education cause, and also achieving great results. The curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods of our schools at all levels and of all types have been greatly improved. Especially in the aspect of political education, due to the correct guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, the young students and the masses of the people throughout the country have greatly improved politically through participating in the great movements of Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and Sino-Soviet friendship. This is a brilliant example of the education method of unifying theory and practice that Comrade Mao Zedong insisted on. All educators throughout the country should learn well.

　　However, our educators

　　学习和贯彻毛主席的教育思想
    ——为纪念中国共产党的三十周年而作
       钱俊瑞
    一
    中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志，对于教育工作的指示，是每一个教育工作者所必须深刻领会的。
    毛泽东同志和他伟大的老师马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林一样，历来就是照着辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的科学原理，提出问题和解决问题的。他对于文化和教育问题，也就是这样。
    毛泽东同志说：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治经济的反映，又给予伟大影响于一定社会的政治经济。”因此，“问题是很清楚的，我们要革除的那种中华民族的旧文化，它是不能离开中华民族的旧政治与旧经济的；而我们要建立的这种中华民族的新文化，它也不能离开中华民族的新政治与新经济。中华民族的旧政治与旧经济，乃是中华民族旧文化的根据；而中华民族的新政治与新经济，乃是中华民族新文化的根据。”（《新民主主义论》）。
    结论是什么呢？就是：我们必须革命，不要改良主义，更不许可投降主义。毛泽东同志说：“这些统治的政治、经济、文化形态，就是我们革命的对象，我们要革除的，就是这种殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的旧政治、旧经济与旧文化形态。而我们要建立起来的，则是与此相反的东西，乃是中华民族的新政治、新经济与新文化。”（《新民主主义论》）。这是唯一正确的马克思主义的命题，而是根本上区别于一切资产阶级的和小资产阶级的改良主义的。
    世界上有了革命，人们参加了革命，事情就都好办了，一切都有希望了，其中，文化教育工作也就有了真正的办法和真正的希望了，而在革命发动之前，我们的文化教育工作就应该是、而且也只应该是为革命作思想的准备。
    一九二五——二七年大革命爆发了，湖南的农民运动狂风暴雨般地开展着。请看毛泽东同志怎样观察和分析当时农民中间的文化教育工作吧。他说：“中国有百分之九十以上是未受文化的国民，这个里面，最大多数就是农民。农村里剥削阶级势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。试看农民一向痛恶学校，如今却努力在办夜学。”“如今他们却大办其夜学，名之曰‘农民学校’，有些已经举办，有些正在筹备，平均每一个乡农民协会有夜学一所。他们非常热心开办这种夜学，以为这样的夜学才真正是他们自己的。”“农运发展的结果，农民的文化自然提高了，不久的时间内，全省当有几千所学校在乡中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓‘教育家’者流，空唤‘普及教育’，唤来唤去还是一句废话。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）。他又说，“政治宣传的普及乡村，全是农民协会的功绩。很简单的一些标语、图画和讲演，使得农民如同每个都进过一下子政治学校的样，收效非常之广而速。”又说：“开一万个法政学校，能不能在这样短时间内普及政治教育于穷乡僻壤的男女老少，像现在农会所做的政治教育一样呢？我想一定不能罢。”
    一九二七年以后土地革命在南方各省发展着，农民打倒了地主阶级，分到了土地，就大批办小学、夜学、识字班、俱乐部；俱乐部下又有“体育”“墙报”“晚会”等很多的委员会，“俱乐部都有新戏。”毛泽东同志在考察了江西省兴国县长冈乡的这些工作之后，就说：“每个乡人民政府都要学习长冈乡的文化教育工作！”（长冈乡调查）。
    在抗日战争时期，抗日民主根据地里面的新文化新教育运动发展得非常之广泛和深入。毛泽东同志指出，“这种文化的政治经济基础，就是民选政府，就是减租减息，就是以各种规模的工厂与各种形式的合作社为领导的个体经济。”（《在陕甘宁边区文教大会上的讲话》）。而没有这种政治经济基础，这样大规模的新的文化教育工作是不可能的。
    中国人民大革命的胜利产生了人民的中华人民共和国，这样我们才能进行最大规模的人民教育事业。毛泽东同志说：“有了人民的国家，人民才有可能在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”（《论人民民主专政》）。
    由此可知，只有革命胜利了，“剥削阶级势力”打倒了，人民有了“人民的国家”和“民选的政府”了，人民的文化教育运动才能大规模地“开始”，人民才能在全国范围内和全体规模上教育和改造自己，才能把学校认为“真正是他们自己的”学校。
    由此可知，中外一切所谓“教育救国论”，“教育万能论”，社会民主党的所谓“先培养人才，然后革命”的改良主义理论，以及在旧中国空唤什么“普及教育”等等，都不过是“一句废话”，说得严重一点，说它们是自欺欺人的谎话，也是应该的。更不消说，以“苦行”“兴学”为旗帜，不折不扣地实行向封建主义屈膝投降的反动的“武训主义”，是更加可鄙与可耻的了。
    毛泽东同志这种关于文化教育问题的科学观点是以马克思列宁主义的党的世界观，亦即辩证唯物主义为根据的。他教导我们：“马克思说：‘不是社会意识决定社会存在，而是社会存在决定社会意识。’他又说：‘从来的哲学家只是各式各样的说明宇宙，但是重要的乃在于改造宇宙。’这是自有人类历史以来第一次正确解决意识与存在关系问题的科学的规定，而为后来列宁深刻发挥了的能动的革命的反映论之基本出发点。我们讨论中国文化问题，不能忘记这个出发点。”（《新民主主义论》）。
    马克思曾经说过，“认为人们是环境与教育的产物，从而认为已经改变了的人们乃是另一种环境和改变了教育之产物——这个唯物论（按指机械唯物论——钱）的学说，忘记了环境正是由人来改变的，而教育者本身就应该受教育。……环境的改变与人类活动的符合，只能看做而且应该合理地理解为革命的实践”。（“费尔巴哈论纲”）。马克思和恩格斯在他们的另一著作中说过：“为了在广大群众中产生……共产主义的觉悟，以及为了达到自己的目的，都必须使人们起大规模的改变，这种改变只有在实践的运动中，即在革命中才有可能；因此，革命之所以必需，不仅在于没有可能采取任何别的方法来推翻统治阶级，而且在于那个起来推翻它的阶级只有在革命中才能摆脱一切旧的可恶的东西，而成为有能力创造新社会的阶级。”（马恩全集俄文版第四卷第六十页）。
    列宁继续发展了这种思想。他说：“工人们只有在长期的斗争中，在为着创造新的共产主义社会而作坚持的实践活动中，他们自己也就得到思想的改造。工人们不是根据命令或口号就能马上从自己的小资产阶级的成见中解放出来的”（列宁全集俄文版第二十五卷第二四七页）。
    毛泽东同志在他的名著《实践论》中又深刻地发展了列宁的反映论。他说：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。在马克思主义看来，理论是重要的，它的重要性充分地表现在列宁说过的一句话：“没有革命的理论就没有革命的运动。”然而马克思主义看重理论，正是，也仅仅是，因为它能够指导行动。”（《实践论》）。他又说，“认识的能动作用，不但表现于从感性的认识到理性的认识之能动的飞跃，更重要的还须表现于从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃。抓着了世界的规律性的认识，必须把它再回到改造世界的实践中去，再用到生产的实践，革命的阶级斗争与民族斗争的实践以及科学实验的实践中去。”（同上）。
    他教导我们说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践”（同上）。
    因之，第一，我们必须革命，因为不搞革命，就不能推翻反动的统治阶级，就不能有新文化教育的根据；
    第二，革命的理论，革命的文化教育，必须用来推动和指导革命的行动，否则它就没有任何价值；
    第三，劳动者和全体人民必须在革命中，在变革现实的斗争中，受到教育，得到知识。
    因此，离开革命的实践，离开改造世界即变革现实的实践，而空谈教育，都不免是废话而实质上就是谎话，这难道还不明显么？
  二
    革命胜利后的新中国的教育应该是在全国范围内和全体规模上的人民教育，也就是为人民大众服务，并成为人民大众“真正自己的”教育。这种人民教育是建筑在人民的政治与人民的经济的基础之上的，它是新政治与新经济的反映，同时又以极大的力量推动和指导着新政治新经济的建设。
    新中国的人民教育是人民国家的产物。它通过了各种具体的运动（如抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、爱国公约等运动）和各种具体的机构（如团体、学校、工厂、机关），已经逐渐地成为全国范围的和全体规模的巨大事业。它是中国的工人阶级经过它的先锋队中国共产党教育自己并教育全体人民，摆脱内外反动派的影响，改造从旧社会传下来的坏习惯和坏思想，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展的广大的阵地。
    我们这个人民的国家，在现阶段，是人民民主专政的国家，也就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。我们的人民教育就应该是这种国家的基本情况的反映。这就决定了我们人民教育的领导思想、对象、内容和方法等等一系列的问题。
    新中国的文化教育应该是工人阶级领导的文化教育。新中国的人民文化和人民教育的领导思想应该也只能是无产阶级的思想，而不应该也决不能是任何别的阶级的思想。毛泽东同志说：“所谓新民主主义的文化，就是人民大众反帝反封建的文化……这种文化，只能受无产阶级的文化思想即共产主义思想去领导，任何别的阶级的文化思想都是不能领导了的。所谓新民主主义的文化，一句话，就是‘无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的文化’。”（《新民主主义论》）。
    为什么人民的文化教育必须以无产阶级的思想为领导，而不能以别的任何阶级的思想为领导呢？这是因为“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界与改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上”（《实践论》）；是“因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。在帝国主义时代，任何国家的任何别的阶级，都不能领导任何真正的革命达到胜利。中国的小资产阶级和民族资产阶级曾经多次领导过革命，都失败了，就是明证”（《论人民民主专政》）。
    我们所说的无产阶级的思想就是马列主义和毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“在现时，毫无疑义，应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马列主义的学习，没有这种宣传与学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命到胜利。”（《新民主主义论》）。
    现在我国的人民民主革命由于马列主义和毛泽东思想的领导，已经得到了胜利，全中国的人民现在都拍手欢迎和心悦诚服这个马列主义、毛泽东思想，大家都在热烈要求学习这个马列主义和毛泽东思想。我们的责任就在于用马列主义的立场、观点和方法，在全国范围内和全体规模上，教育全体人民，同时教育自己，首先要脱离内外反动派的影响，即肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，同时“改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想”，其中也包括各种各色的资产阶级的和小资产阶级的坏习惯和坏思想。对于内外反动派的思想影响，即对于封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，我们应该采取坚决反对和肃清的方针。毛泽东同志指示我们说：“一切奴化的、封建主义的与法西斯主义的文化、教育，应当采取适当的但是坚决的步骤，加以扫除。”（《论联合政府》）。又说：“这类反动文化是替帝国主义与封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”（《新民主主义论》）。而在现阶段，我们对于资产阶级、小资产阶级和农民的思想中间的坏成份，应该采取批评的方法和民主辩论的方法去加以批驳，因为这些成份对祖国和人民是不利的。
    新中国的人民教育，必须是人民大众的教育。毛泽东同志说：“这种新民主主义的文化是大众的，因而即是民主的。它应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化。”（《新民主主义论》）。为什么缘故？因为“人民民主专政的基础是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级的联盟，而主要是工人和农民的联盟，因为这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十。推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量，由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。”（《论人民民主专政》）。
    因此，我们的教育必须首先为工农兵（兵是武装起来了的工农）服务。
    我们的一切教育工作者必须首先解决这一个“为什么人服务”的问题。这就是一个立场问题，也就是一个根本的问题。如果这个问题在我们许多教育工作者中间得不到很好的解决，我们的人民教育就难于顺畅前进。
    有人说，现在再没有人愿意为帝国主义服务了。但是在抗美援朝运动中，在处理接受美国津贴的文教机关的工作中，是不是有些人还暴露出对帝国主义、特别对美帝国主义的幻想和多少不等的留恋情绪呢？
    有人说，现在再没有人愿意为封建主义服务了。但是那张完全宣传向封建主义屈服投降的电影片《武训传》一出世，是不是还有不少教育工作者，包括一些共产党员在内，就拍手叫好，并且丢下武器，举起双手当了俘虏呢？
    有人说，现在再没有人为国民党反动派服务了。但是有些原来在国民党统治地区长期驯服地工作过的人们是不是还没有完全认识过去的错误呢？
    有人说，现在再没有人首先为资产阶级或小资产阶级服务了，但是还有相当一批的教育工作者，对于学校为工农兵开门的方针缺乏兴趣和表示冷淡呢？
    我们的人民教育，第一必须是为着工农兵，第二是为着小资产阶级，第三，才是为其他爱国民主阶层。我们的许多教育工作者在“为什么人”这个问题上还没有得到解决，或者还没有得到很好的解决。但是这个问题必须明确地彻底地解决。毛泽东同志关于文艺工作者所说的一段话是同样适用于我们的教育工作者的。他说：“时间无论怎么长，我们却必须解决它，必须明确地彻底地解决它。我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把屁股移过来，一定要在深入工农兵，深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马列主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）。我们应该这样说，在今天我们的教育工作者只有认真和严肃地克服资产阶级的客观主义思想，端正自己的立场，抱对祖国、对人民完全负责的态度，把脚跟真个站到工农兵这方面来了，我们才能有真正为工农兵的教育，才能有真正的人民教育。
    这是今天我们改革旧教育和发展人民教育的关键问题。新中国的一切教育工作者对此应该警惕并引起严重的注意。现在我们在各地开展着的关于电影《武训传》和“武训精神”的讨论，对于这个根本问题的解决是会有帮助的，大家应该紧紧抓住这一环，并和自己的具体立场联系起来。
    在我们的具体工作中，我们应该着重地为普及工农兵及其子女的教育而努力。在培养国家建设人才的工作方面，我们应该加倍地注意吸收优秀的产业工人、农业劳动模范和长期参加革命的干部，到各种学校中去学习科学，学习技术，培养他们成为新中国建设人才的坚强骨干。我们如果不能这样做，那就会在政治上犯错误。
  三
    新中国现阶段的人民教育是新民主主义的教育，也就是毛泽东同志所指出的，是民族的、科学的、大众的教育。
    这种人民教育是民族的。“它是反对帝国主义压迫，主张中华民族的尊严与独立的。它是我们这个民族的，带有我们民族的特性。”（《新民主主义论》）。这种教育是人民的爱国主义的教育。发扬高度的与国际主义相结合的爱国主义，是新中国一切人民的教育工作者的重大责任。
    中国人民的爱国主义是中国人民完成其解放事业和建设独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国的一个伟大动力。它有强大的经济、政治和思想的基础。
    我们的人民爱国主义的经济基础，就是以社会主义性质的国营经济为领导的，包括着五种社会经济成份的分工合作，各得其所的中国人民经济。这个人民经济随着我们国家工业化的发展而日益壮大，并且逐渐增强社会主义的经济成份以至在将来走到社会主义。这就在经济生活上保证着祖国人民的巩固的团结和坚决的进步。
    我们的人民爱国主义的政治基础，就是以工人阶级为领导的、工农联盟为基础的，团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政。这个人民民主专政的目的，就是反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强而奋斗。我国各民主阶级和国内各民族的坚强团结就是我们的爱国主义的力量的重要源泉。
    我们的人民爱国主义的思想基础就是伟大的毛泽东思想—马列主义理论与中国革命实践之统一的思想。毛泽东思想是最彻底和最完满地代表着中华民族和中国人民的利益的最伟大和最完整的爱国主义思想，而毛泽东同志就是我国空前未有的最伟大的爱国主义者，毛泽东同志本人，就是我们伟大祖国与伟大人民之最完整的和最美满的体现。爱国主义不论在新民主主义阶段，或在将来社会主义阶段，都是毛泽东思想的一个最重要的方面。因此热爱祖国是与热爱毛主席分不开的，发扬爱国主义与学习和贯彻毛泽东思想是根本分不开的。这就是为什么我们的爱国主义在思想上有着无穷无尽的威力。
    进行爱国主义教育的目的就在于把这种有强大基础的爱国主义思想贯彻到儿童、青年和人民群众中去，使他们有高度的民族自尊心和自信心，使他们热爱祖国，将自己与祖国的命运紧紧联系起来，使他们热爱人民，充分信任人民的力量，而对人民的敌人深恶痛绝，使他们能够为着祖国的利益和光荣，牺牲个人利益直到流最后一滴血。
    为要达到上述目的，我们的爱国主义教育应该包含下列主要内容：
    （一）我们祖国光荣和伟大的历史，特别是人民群众的斗争和创造。
    （二）坚决反对帝国主义的侵略和封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫，坚决反对民族自卑心、依赖心，发扬民族自尊心、自信心。
    （三）新中国比祖国历史上任何时期都要光荣伟大。它是人民长期斗争的果实，必须坚决保卫这种胜利果实，保卫祖国领土主权的完整，使其不受侵犯。
    （四）拥护新民主主义，拥护共同纲领，巩固和扩大人民民主专政，以高度的热忱与忠诚，运用一切知识和本领建设新中国。
    （五）爱劳动、爱人民、爱护公共财物。
    （六）拥护中国共产党、拥护中国人民解放军、热爱伟大的毛主席。
    （七）拥护中国与苏联和各人民民主国家以及全世界劳动人民的国际主义的联盟。
    （八）坚持进步，反对落后，决心争取比新民主主义更加美满的前途，即社会主义与共产主义的前途。
    在进行爱国主义教育时，要善于用新鲜的事实，如抗美援朝的胜利、土地改革、镇压反革命以及各种建设的成就，通过一定的课外活动，运用和组织青年、儿童和工农群众自身的经验以提高他们的认识，引向爱国主义的更高水平，另一方面，我们要将爱国主义教育贯彻到各种学科中去。
    这种人民教育是科学的。“它是反对一切封建思想与迷信思想，主张实事求是，主张客观真理，主张理论与实践一致的。”（《新民主主义论》）。因此，我们的教育工作者首先要认真学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》，进而系统地和通俗地宣传唯物主义，宣传《实践论》，并把这种普遍的科学的真理贯穿到学校的各门功课中去。这是我们教育工作者的一项基本的工作。我们必须学习和传授现代科学技术的最新成就，使它们与新中国的建设密切联系起来，并为这个建设服务。使国家遵循科学的方向工业化，使每个人都具备科学的世界观，这就是我们的任务。
    这种人民教育是大众的。上面讲过，我们应该首先向工农兵普及文化科学和政治的教育。人民民主专政国家的成立，创造了真正地而不是口头地或幻想地普及教育的前提。这种普及教育的内容是正确地反映人民民主的政治与经济，并能推进这种政治与经济的内容，亦即为人民群众所需要的内容，它的形式也是人民群众所乐于接受而不是毛泽东同志所指斥的那种为群众“讨厌”的形式。这个普及教育的内容与形式都会逐步提高。这里就发生教育工作中的普及与提高的问题。毛泽东同志关于文艺工作所指示的普及与提高正确结合的方针，对人民教育的工作是完全适用的。他教导我们说：“现在工农兵面前的问题，是他们正在与敌人作残酷斗争，而他们由于长时期的封建阶级与资产阶级的统治，不识字、愚昧、无文化，所以他们的迫切要求，就是把他们所急需的与所能迅速接受的文化知识和文艺作品向他们作普遍的启蒙运动，去提高他们的斗争热情与胜利信心，加强他们的团结，使他们同心同德地去和敌人作斗争。……所以对于人民，第一步最严重最中心的任务是普及工作，而不是提高工作。轻视忽视普及工作的态度是错误的。”他指出：“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建立新中国的必要条件。”（《论联合政府》）他又说：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高。在这里，普及是人民的普及，提高也是人民的提高，而这种提高，不是在空中提高，不是关门提高，而是在普及基础上的提高。这种提高，为普及所决定，同时又给普及以指导。……所以我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高，我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）。普及与提高这种辩证的结合，也就是新中国人民教育发展的规律。
  四
    既然新中国的教育是以工人阶级的思想为领导的，它就必须受工人阶级的观点和思想方法的指导。因此新民主主义教育的方法，应该是理论与实际一致的方法。为什么呢？斯大林说过：“科学与实际活动间的联系，理论与实践间的联系，它们的一致，应当成为无产阶级政党的南针。”（《辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义》）。
    列宁曾经痛斥资产阶级旧教育的基本特点之一就是理论与实际脱节。他说：“旧时资本主义社会所遗留给我们的最大祸害之一就是书本与实践完全隔离。”（《论青年团的任务》）。远在二十六年前，毛泽东同志就看出这种旧教育的不合理。他说：“我从前在学校读书时，看见农民反对‘洋学堂’，也和一般‘洋学生’‘洋教习’一鼻孔出气，站在洋学堂的利益上面，总觉得农民是‘愚民可恶’。民十四年在乡下住了半年，才明白我是错了，农民的道理是极对。乡村小学教材完全说些城里的东西，不合农村的需要；而小学教师对待农民的态度又非常之不好，不但不是农民的帮助者，反而变成了农民所讨厌的。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）。
    毛泽东同志一贯地坚持着理论与实际一致的原则，反对教条主义和经验主义。他在一九三八年就曾说过：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论是‘放之四海而皆准’的理论。不是把他们的理论当作教条看，而是当作行动的指南。不是学习马克思列宁主义的字母，而是学习他们观察问题与解决问题的立场与方法。只有这个行动指南，只有这个立场与方法，才是革命的科学，才是引导我们认识革命对象与指导革命行动的惟一正确的方针。”（《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》）。
    一九四一年五月十九日毛泽东同志专门作了一次讲演，题目叫做《改造我们的学习》。他严厉地批评了在我们的学习方法与学习制度中那种反科学的主观主义的方法论。他说：“他们违背了马、恩、列、斯所谆谆告诫人们的一条基本原则：理论与实际统一。他们既然违背了马、恩、列、斯的这条原则，于是他们自己就造出了一条相反的原则：理论与实际分离。在学校教育中，在在职干部教育中，教哲学的不引导学生研究中国革命的逻辑，教经济学的不引导学生研究中国经济的特点，教政治学的不引导学生研究中国革命的策略，教军事学的不引导学生研究中国军事的特点，诸如此类，其结果，谬种流传，误人子弟。”他又说，“总之，这种反科学的反马克思主义的主观主义的方法论是共产党的大敌，是无产阶级的大敌，是人民的大敌，是民族的大敌，是党性不纯的表现。大敌当前，我们有打倒它之必要。……没有科学态度或没有完全的科学态度，即是说，没有或不完全有马克思主义的理论与实践统一的态度，就叫做没有党性，或叫做党性不完全。”
    当时毛泽东同志具体地提出下列建议：一、系统地周密地研究周围环境，也就是对实际事物进行调查研究工作。二、分析和综合地研究近百年的中国史。三、对于在职干部教育与学校干部教育应以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，由此出发去研究马列主义，废除静止地孤立地研究马列主义的方法。
    一九四二年毛泽东同志又提倡和领导了整顿三风的运动，他把反对主观主义以整顿学风列为整风的“第一个重要问题”。他号召全体同志，“学会运用马列主义的立场、观点、思想方法，认真的研究中国的历史，研究中国的经济、政治、军事、文化，对每一问题加以调查研究，然后创造出理论。”他号召“有书本知识的人向实际方面发展，然后才可以不停止在书本上，才可以不犯教条主义的错误。有工作经验的人，要向理论方面学习，要认真读书，然后才可以使经验带上条理性，综合性，上升到理论，然后才可以不把局部经验误认为即是普遍真理，才可不犯经验主义的错误”（《整顿学风党风文风》）。
    十年来中国共产党的广大党员和干部以及新中国的各方面的工作人员们遵照了毛泽东同志的这些指示，改造自己的学习，端正自己的立场、观点与思想方法，并且收到了辉煌的效果，大大加快了革命的胜利。
    中华人民共和国成立后，新中国的人民教育也是遵照着毛泽东同志指示的方针，以理论与实际一致的原则，改革旧的教育，发展新的人民教育事业，并且也收到了很大的效果。我们各级各类学校的课程、教材和教学法已经有了不少的改进。特别在政治教育方面由于毛泽东同志的正确指导，全国青年学生和人民群众通过了参加抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命，以及中苏友好等巨大的运动，在政治上确是大大地提高了。这是毛泽东同志所坚持的理论与实际一致的教育方法的辉煌例子，全国教育工作者应该好好学习。
    但是我们的教育工作者，在教育方法方面，现在还是有许多缺点的。其中最严重的缺点，还是这两条：一是教条主义，一是经验主义。
    目前新区教师们的一个相当普遍的毛病，就是老教条主义。这个老教条主义的内容，包含着封建的老教条和资本主义帝国主义的洋教条。这个内容是反科学的、反真理的，即不是毛主席所说的“科学的反映了客观事物”的“可靠的知识”（实践论），而是帝国主义、封建阶级和官僚资产阶级为要维护其反动统治的利益而进行的说教。极大多数旧中国的教育工作者习惯于用这样的不可靠的知识，生硬地灌进青年和儿童的头脑。它对于新中国教育的建设已经成为极大的阻力，我们必须坚决反对老教条主义这种反动的教育内容，而代之以新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的教育内容。
    与这种反科学的老教条的内容紧紧结合着的，就是老教条主义的一套僵硬的、机械的教学法。它对于我们的年青的一代是一座压在身上的大山。我们一定要和它进行斗争，革除这种老教条主义的教学方法，实行理论与实际联系的正确的教学方法。
    对于在老区长期工作过的同志要着重注意反对经验主义。这种经验主义的具体表现，如许多同志还轻视理论学习，特别是不习惯于系统的理论学习，政治教育只是老一套，缺乏新鲜具体的内容；在学校工作中轻视各种必要的制度；不习惯于正规的课堂教学；只求开会多，只想搞“运动”；认为生产劳动就是体育；不注重学校应以教学为主；在学校里实行极端民主等等。这种经验主义已使我们的某些同志对新鲜事物的感觉日益迟钝，自满自足，丧失上进之心。它是妨碍我们进步和提高工作质量的重大障碍，必须力求改正。我们的这些教师应该进行系统的理论学习，学习总结经验，逐步提高自己的政治、理论水平。
  五
    毛泽东同志的博大精深的教育学说是伟大的毛泽东思想的一部分。作为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的最好的学生，毛泽东同志是中国工人阶级和中国人民的最优秀的代表，他是我们一切革命工作者的最完美的模范，同时也是一切宣传工作者与教育工作者的最完美的模范。毛泽东同志说：“社会实践中的发生、发展与消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展与消灭的过程也是无穷的。根据于一定的思想、理论、计划、方案以从事于变革客观现实的实践，一次又一次地向前，人们对客观现实的认识也就一次又一次地深化。客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结”（《实践论》）。依据这种认识，毛泽东同志号召大家虚心学习。他说：“和全党同志们共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿”（《农村调查序言二》）。又说：“对自己，‘学而不厌’，对人家，‘诲人不倦’，我们应取这种态度。”（《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》）。而这也就是毛泽东同志作为伟大的人民领袖和伟大的教育家所采取了的态度。我们每个教育工作者和一切革命工作者都应该以上面所说的科学根据为基础，学习他的这种态度。
    人民的新中国的成立，为中国的工人阶级及其先锋队开辟了教育自己和教育全体人民的无限宽广远大的前程。对于这个前程，毛泽东同志描写得多么深刻和多么光灿啊！他说道：“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界与改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。这种根据科学认识而定下来的改造世界的实践过程，在世界、在中国均已到达了一个历史的时节——自有历史以来未曾有过的重大时节，这就是整个儿地推翻世界与中国的黑暗面，把它们转变过来成为前所未有的光明世界，无产阶级及革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。地球上已经有一部分实行了这种改造，这就是苏联。他们还正在促进这种改造过程。中国人民与世界人民也都正在或将要通过这样的改造过程。所谓被改造的客观世界，其中包括了一切反对改造的人们，他们的被改造，须要通过强迫的阶段，然后才能进入自觉的阶段。世界到了全人类都自觉地改造自己与改造世界的时候，那就是世界的共产主义时代。”（《实践论》）。
    一切革命工作者和一切教育工作者，朝着毛泽东同志所指示的方向，勇敢和胜利地前进吧！为完成落在我们肩上的光荣责任而奋斗吧！
