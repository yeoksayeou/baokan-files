　　Today's Shichahai (Sketches of the Capital, No. 9)
    By Shao Yu
    In the past,
    At the mention of Shichahai—at the mention of that stinking, stagnant pool,
    One would think of mud, dampness, mosquitoes, flies, infectious diseases...
    The Jiang family's officials and dignitaries,
    None of them cared about it!
    They were busy managing their mansions and villas.
    Busy squeezing the people's fat and oil!
    Now,
    Look,
    A swimming pool has been built. (Attached picture)

　　今日的什刹海（首都速写之九）
    邵宇作
    在过去，
    一提起什刹海——提起那发了臭的死水坑，
    也就会想起泥泞、潮湿、蚊子、苍蝇、传染病……
    蒋家的达官要人们，
    谁也不去管它！
    他们忙着管自己的公馆和别墅去了。
    忙着括民脂民膏去啦！
    现在，
    看吧，
    修游泳池了。（附图片）
