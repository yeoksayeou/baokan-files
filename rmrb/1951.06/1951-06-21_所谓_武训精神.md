The So-called "Wu Xun Spirit"
      Yuan Liangyi
    
    I.
    Regarding Wu Xun's "unworthiness as a model," the discussions in various places seem to have reached a consensus: Wu Xun not only lacked revolutionary thought; but his actions directly served the reactionary ruling class.

    However, in the process of the discussion, there has always been a "easily confusing" place that has not been analyzed very clearly, which is the so-called "Wu Xun spirit." Some people have cited Mr. Tao Xingzhi's past praise of the "Wu Xun spirit" to corroborate their words, believing that Wu Xun's spirit of begging for alms to establish schools for the past thirty years has always been good, and Wu Xun is ultimately a "good person," regardless of his role. Some people even believe that "after all, his strong perseverance and hard-working spirit are worth learning."

    We know that many people in the past praised Wu Xun actually starting from this point, which was regarded as a miracle of the ages and circulated. Min Erchang's compiled supplementary collection of inscriptions said: "Although Xun did not study, his actions secretly coincided with the principles of ancient sages and former virtuous men, how strange is this!" Later, Liang Qichao, Liu Bannong and others wrote biographies for Wu Xun, especially praising this point. When filming the movie "The Story of Wu Xun," Mr. Sun Yu regarded this spirit as "typically demonstrating the noble qualities of diligence, bravery, and wisdom of our Chinese nation," which can be said to be exaggerated to the extreme.

    At the same time, we can also see that although many people now have admitted that Wu Xun's behavior is "unworthy as a model," they always feel that Wu Xun's subjective wishes are not entirely reprehensible. Thus they completely separate Wu Xun's subjective wishes from social practice. As a result, the "Wu Xun spirit" has become the last line of defense for those who sympathize with Wu Xun, and based on this position, many confusing ideas continue to emerge.

    Therefore, the question now is: How to destroy this last line of defense—the "Wu Xun spirit."

  II.
    Analyzing the "Wu Xun spirit" should begin with understanding his background.

    Some people believe that Wu Xun "was originally a hardworking and kind farmer" and "was not very different from ordinary farmers before the age of twenty." This is not in line with the facts. As for Mr. Sun Yu's deliberate exaggeration, saying that he said to poor children: "Remember this, when you grow up, never forget us farmers!" it is even more out of an inappropriate subjective fabrication. In fact, it is difficult for us to say that he had any experience of rural life. When he was seven years old, his father died, and since then he had been living a life of begging and working as a hired hand. And before the age of seven, he was too young, and the life of spring plowing and summer weeding does not seem to have had a great impact on him. Moreover, it can also be seen from his later thoughts and actions that none of his forty or so school-building songs mentioned farming, and he can be said to have no interest in land at all. When his mother passed away, he negotiated to get back the three acres of ancestral land that he was entitled to and immediately sold them to someone else. A farmer who loves his land would not do this.

    An important period was Wu Xun's age from seven to fourteen (Daoguang twenty-five to Xianfeng two). During these seven or eight years, his main life was "begging," followed by doing odd jobs for others. When he was begging, he often followed the children of landlords and wealthy households, and his motivation to study was aroused by envying these children for being able to study. In his envious eyes, we cannot see any color of hatred or dissatisfaction. On the contrary, he felt that this was a very ideal thing, but that he was "not good enough, and had no clothes." Some people say that he had the idea of "climbing up," which is completely correct.

    From the age of fourteen to twenty-one, he worked as a hired hand successively in the homes of his clan uncle, the Zhang family, and a certain Xiangsheng (holder of the lowest degree in the imperial examination system). Two things are worth noting during this period. First, he worked in the Xiangsheng's house and was enslaved all day long, but he had no complaints. He often felt that it was not easy for a poor beggar like himself to find a job, and that it was right to endure the hard life and the harsh treatment. Second, he never forgot his begging life. When he was bullied by the Xiangsheng, he was both angry and sad, and he immediately changed his attitude and took begging as his lifelong main occupation. He also mentioned this point in his self-compiled school-building song: "Carrying work (i.e., helping with work) is subject to being bullied, it is better to beg for food and be your own master." From these two points, it can be seen that his begging life in his childhood often played a role in his consciousness.

    Wu Xun's experience and attitude to life make us have to consider this question: Was his thirty years of enduring hardship and poverty dominated by his "selfless spirit" or "altruism"?

    From Wu Xun's more than forty school-building songs, it can be seen that besides a slight sense of inferiority, there is no place where he feels the hardship and hatred of life. On the contrary, he is very optimistic and confident. For example, when he was begging, he sang:

    "If you don't give me, I won't complain, there will be good people to take care of my meals.
    Carrying a bag and wandering the streets, building a free school is not a worry."

    This attitude hides a most reactionary and backward idea, not at all "selfless" or "altruistic," but a parasitic vagrant idea that deviates from the track of production. This is the real reason why he insisted on "begging" for thirty years "without any doubts." As for his kneeling to everyone he met, and "erecting one, one coin, erecting ten, ten coins," this set of tricks is also an ugly habit he developed from his vagrant life since childhood.

  III.
    Wu Xun's "altruistic" spirit is criticized as "anti-reality," which is correct from the perspective of the broad masses of working people. But among the landlords and wealthy gentlemen at that time, it had its "realistic" foundation.

    It is not accidental that the ruling class representing feudal landlords praised Wu Xun as "enjoying doing good deeds," and the working people called him "bean curd dregs." This contradiction reflected on the viewpoints of thought and morality at that time, and it was clearly two different battle lines. Comrade Jia Ji criticized Wu Xun, saying that he was a "subjectivist," believing that "literacy is only his own subjective requirement," which is inappropriate, because "subjectivism" also has a certain class content. People like Wu Xun not only deviated from "the essential requirements of farmers' lives at that time" but also fundamentally betrayed the working people, willingly serving the feudal rulers, and cannot be confused and concealed by "subjective" or "subjectivism."

    Why did Wu Xun betray the working people? It is not difficult to answer this question, because the previous section has pointed out that Wu Xun was not a farmer, and he did not have a deep experience of the painful life of farmers under feudal exploitation; although he had worked hard, he did not develop a correct labor viewpoint of struggle because of this. He was located in the area of Guantao, Linqing, Tangyi, and Shenxian, which had the most revolutionary traditions and influences. The Taiping Army's northern aid troops in Xianfeng four years, the Boxer Movement that began to brew when Wu Xun was alive, and the continuous resistance and struggles caused by the change of the Yellow River's course and the exploitation of officials and gentry all reflected the "essential requirements" of the working people at that time. However, Wu Xun was able to "remain indifferent" in the face of such a great revolutionary wave, completely satisfied with the begging life of "carrying a bag and wandering the streets," and "good people will take care of my meals." After being bullied by the Xiangsheng's family, he was angry and started a school, but he did not want to take the life of the Xiangsheng, but only wanted to avoid being bullied by the Xiangsheng again. He thought that if the poor people knew how to read, they could "catch up" with the landlords and wealthy gentlemen. This idea developed from the childhood envy that the landlord's children could study and "make progress," but it was made more profound through a period of life in the Xiangsheng's house.

    As for the fact that Wu Xun's school-building was not exclusively for himself, there were also words such as "for everyone" and "for the poor" in his songs. However, this concept of "for everyone" and "for the poor" is not only vague but also contains very deep reactionary toxins. He not only willingly became a slave serving the ruling class himself, but also hoped that the children of the poor would also read the books of sages, and forcibly guide them from the front line of the working people to the opposite path of becoming slaves. His affirmation of the feudal order at that time reached an astonishing degree. The most prominent example is: he worked like a beast of burden to lend money and collect rent to run a free school. When inviting the school teacher and the gentry to drink, he "stood outside the door and waited for the banquet to end before sipping the leftovers, saying: I am a beggar, and I cannot salute the teacher." His trust and loyalty to the landlords and gentry also reached an unsurpassable level. He himself "accumulated little by little, and established schools in three prefectures and counties. The housing and expenses were entrusted to the chief administrators to manage, and he never intervened," and the only work he did in the free school every day was: "Whenever the teachers and students were lazy, he would kneel in front of them."

    Wu Xun's "miracle" is inseparable from the support and "praise" of the ruling class representing the feudal landlords. It became a "miracle" precisely because it met the requirements of the landlords and gentry. In Daoguang forty-five years, a memorial from Li Hongbin, the Governor-General of Huguang, clearly stated the ruling class's view of free schools at that time:

    "Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province borders Henan Province, and the customs of the people are fierce. Your minister Li Hongbin instructed Zhou Kai, the Prefect of Xiangyang Prefecture, in the spring of Daoguang forty-four years to supervise the subordinate prefectures and counties to persuade the gentry and elders to establish more free schools in rural villages and towns, visit and extend sincere Confucian scholars, and induce children to enter schools to recite and read, in order to educate them effectively." (Daoguang Memorial)

    Later, Yang Jinshi, Guo Zhixian, and Zhang Governor and Yuan Governor praised Wu Xun, which was basically based on this spirit. At the same time, it can also be seen from the fact that the working people despised the rulers' propaganda of "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness" and loved their own stories of heroes who "rebelled against the superiors and caused chaos" that the working people had class feelings on the cultural front. As Tan Yingshi's notes said:

    (During the Tongzhi years) "The ignorant people lack knowledge, so they regard the events of rebellion against the superiors and causing chaos as ordinary; the local officials do not care, and only focus on theft cases and adultery, which are complicated and numerous. They do not know that the events of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness are taught to thousands of people without success, while the books of adultery, theft, fraud, and falsehood are told by one or two people and immediately cause harm. Customs and people's hearts are mutually reinforcing."

    This class feeling shows that although many working people are illiterate, the situation of "one or two people telling it and immediately causing harm" is completely different from Wu Xun's illiteracy but persuading people to read the books of sages. At the same time, it can also show that the errors Wu Xun recognized were not just a matter of "illiteracy."

    There are two different ideologies between Wu Xun and the general working people.

  IV.
    Now we can further examine the most reactionary and backward ideological roots of the "Wu Xun spirit."

    To explain why Wu Xun was willing to work like a beast of burden for the rulers for thirty years, we should first understand the specific content of the reactionary feudal moral concept. The so-called reactionary feudal moral concept actually includes two aspects: the "exploitation" thought of the feudal landlords and the "slave" thought of supporting this "exploitation." Wu Xun used his "conscience," "true god," "invisible virtue," and "retribution" and other fatalistic arguments to affirm the rationality of the feudal order at that time, and combined the attitude of willingly working like a beast of burden with the enslavement and oppression of the landlords.

    The Confucian "Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues" and the Buddhist "Karma" are mutually reinforcing. The Confucian "filial piety" often contains religious content. This is fully demonstrated in Wu Xun's thoughts and actions:

    "Going to burn incense in the south and north villages is not as good as respecting your mother at home. This person is good, this person is good, I give him ten acres and he still thinks it's too little. This person is filial, this person is filial, give him ten acres to support his old age."

    Naturally, this slave thought is also often manifested in another aspect, which is kneeling in front of the rulers and attempting to "climb up" through various fantasies. This fantasy first appeared in Wu Xun's consciousness of envying the landlord's children for being able to study, and later it was transformed into a strong demand for building "free schools," and therefore he spared no effort to engage in the most despicable and dirty behaviors.

    Marx made such a scathing denunciation of these vagrants who "die on the road and are buried, die on the street and are buried" in The Class Struggles in France:

    "They live on the scraps of society and have no fixed profession; they are vagrants, without both hearth and faith; although they differ according to the degree of civilization of the country to which they belong, they will never lose their rogue nature;... they are capable of the most heroic acts and the noblest sacrifices, but they are also capable of the basest thefts and the most sordid acts of depravity."

    And Wu Xun's life deeds are precisely completing this "noblest sacrifice" and "most sordid act of depravity."

    However, some people still praise this reactionary "Wu Xun spirit" in this way: "After all, his strong perseverance and hard-working spirit are worth learning." Recently, some people have further elaborated on this "spirit," saying: "Wu Xun's spirit of sacrifice is amazing, and it has a commonality with the spirit of sacrifice of a great revolutionary. If Wu Xun transferred his 'strong perseverance' and 'hard-working spirit' to the revolutionary side, he would definitely become a great revolutionary."

    This isolated view of "spirit" and emphasis on "spirit" is idealistic. It fails to understand that spirit cannot exist apart from its practical foundation. The reason why the Wu Xun spirit exists is precisely because he accepted a set of the most reactionary, backward, and negative "slave" philosophies through the social practice of begging. If he left this ideological and practical foundation, he would have no "perseverance" to be a beast of burden for the rulers for thirty years! The working people can only create heroic figures like King Chuang, General Chuang, and Black Whirlwind, and will not create the "miracle" of Wu Xun, who worked like a beast of burden for thirty years.

  V.
    Those who affirm the "Wu Xun spirit" are actually affirming the reactionary feudal moral concept. These people are "taking ugliness as beauty." They have failed to see Wu Xun's ugliness, just as Wu Xun has failed to see his own ugliness. Naturally, there are still differences, because they regard Wu Xun's life of being a beast of burden as a bitter thing, as a "miracle," while Wu Xun himself enjoys it, thinking that "if he dies on the road, he will be buried, if he dies on the street, he will be buried, and he will have a coffin when he dies." Although they understand the rulers' "praise," they do not seem to have a good understanding of Wu Xun's "slave" spirit!

    Before the remaining feudal toxins are completely cleared from our midst, there will always be some people who cannot completely forget the "Wu Xun spirit."

### 所谓“武训精神”

　　所谓“武训精神”
      袁良义
    一
    关于武训的“不足为训”，各处的讨论似乎已归于一致：武训不仅没有革命思想；而且他的行动是直接替反动统治阶级服务的。
    但在讨论的过程中间，却始终存在着“容易迷惑人”而未分析得很清楚的地方，就是所谓“武训精神”。有些人曾引用陶行知先生过去对“武训精神”的表扬来佐证自己的话，认为武训三十年来行乞兴学的精神始终是很好的，武训究竟不失为一个“好人”，不管他所起的作用如何。甚至还有些人认为“毕竟他那种坚强的毅力与刻苦精神是值得学习的”。
    我们知道：过去许多人称颂武训实际上是从这一点开始的，它曾被视为千古奇迹而流传。闵尔昌纂录碑传集补上说：“训虽不学，而其行谊竟与古圣昔贤之旨暗合，抑何奇欤？”以后梁启超、刘半农等人为武训作传也是特别表扬这一点，到编《武训传》影剧时，孙瑜先生更把这种精神视为“典型地表现了我们中华民族的勤劳，勇敢，智慧的崇高品质”，可以说夸张到极点了。
    同时，我们也可以看出，现在许多人虽然已承认了武训行为的“不足为训”，但总觉得武训的主观愿望是未可厚非的，这样他们就把武训的主观愿望与社会实践完全分裂开来。结果“武训精神”就成为同情武训者的防守的最后阵地，而且依据着这块阵地上，不断产生出许多混乱的想法来。
    因此，现在问题是：如何摧毁这最后阵地——“武训精神”。
  二
    分析“武训精神”是应从了解他的身世开始的。
    有一些人以为武训“原是劳苦而善良的农民”，“在二十岁以前还和一般农民没有什样大差别”，这是与事实不相符合的。至于孙瑜先生的刻意煊染，说他对穷孩子们说：“你们记牢了，将来长大了，千万不要忘记咱庄稼人！”更是出于一种不妥当的主观的臆造。实际上，我们很难说他对农家生活有什么体验。他在七岁的时候，父亲就死了，从此以后他便一直过着求乞与佣工的生活。而七岁以前，他的年纪太小了，春耕夏耘的生活对他的影响似乎是不大的。并且从他以后的思想与行为上也可以看得出来，在他四十余首兴学歌中没有一首提到种庄稼的事，他对于土地可以说没有一点兴趣。当他在母亲去世以后，把自己应分的三亩祖地办交涉要了过来，立刻就出卖给人家，一个热爱自己土地的农民是不会这样做的。
    重要的一段时期是武训七岁至十四岁（道光二十五年至咸丰二年），这七八年中，他主要的生活是“行乞”，其次是替人家做零工。在行乞的时候，他是经常跟着地主富户小孩子打转子，而他想念书的动机就是由羡慕这些孩子们能念书而引起的。在他艳羡的眼光中，我们看不出一点仇恨与不满的色彩，相反，他倒是觉得这是一种很理想的事情，不过自己是“人不行，又无衣”罢了。有人说他有“向上爬”的思想，这句话是完全正确的。
    十四岁至二十一岁，他先后在族叔，张大户，与某庠生家当佣工。这段时期有两件事值得注意。第一，他在庠生家做工，终日被奴役着，却毫无怨言，常觉得像自己这么一个求乞穷小子，能够找到工作已属不易，生活劳苦些，待遇刻薄些，都是应当忍受的。第二，他始终未能忘掉求乞生活，等到他受庠生的欺侮，且愤且悲，就立刻改变态度而以求乞为终身主要的职业了。他自编的兴学歌中也说到这一点：“扛活（即帮工）受人欺，不如讨饭随自己。”由这两点看来，他年幼时的求乞生活在他的意识中是经常起作用的。
    武训的经历与生活态度，使我们不能不考虑这么一个问题：他三十年来忍苦耐贫，是不是受他的“忘我精神”或“利他主义”所支配？
    从武训所作的四十余首兴学歌来看，其中所表露的除掉微含自卑感外，没有一点感到生活的艰困与厌恨的地方，相反，他倒是非常乐观自信的。如他行乞时唱：
    “不给俺，俺不怨，自有善人管俺饭。
    背着褡子沿街溜，修个义学不犯愁。”
    这种态度，背后深藏有一种最反动的最落后的思想，完全不是什么“忘我”、“利他”，而是一种脱离生产轨道的寄生的游民思想，这才是他三十年来坚持“行乞”而“不曾发生什么疑虑”的真实理由。至于他逢人即跪，以及“竖一个，一个钱，竖十个，十个钱”，这一套把戏，也正是他自幼就过游民生活所养成的一种丑恶习惯。
  三
    武训的“利他”精神被人批判为“反现实”，这从广大的劳动人民而言，是正确的。但在当时的地主富绅之间，却有它“现实”的基础。
    代表封建地主的统治阶级表扬武训为“乐善好施”，与劳动人民叫他为“豆腐沫”，同样不是偶然的。这种矛盾反映在当时的思想道德的观点上，分明是两条不同的战线。贾霁同志批判武训时，说他是“主观主义”，认为“识字，只是他自己的主观要求”，这是不妥当的，因为“主观主义”也具有一定的阶级内容。像武训这种人，不仅离开“当时农民生活中的本质的要求”而且根本就背叛了劳动人民，甘心替封建统治者服务，是不能用“主观”或“主观主义”来混淆与掩盖其反动的本质的。
    武训为什么会背叛劳动人民呢？回答这个问题并不难，因为上一节已经指出武训并不是农民，对于在封建剥削下农家惨痛的生活原没有什么深刻的体验；他虽然做过苦工，但他并没有因此养成正确的斗争的劳动观点，他处在最有革命传统与影响的馆陶，临清，堂邑，莘县一带，咸丰四年的太平军北援部队，在武训生时就开始酝酿的义和团运动，以及因黄河改道与官绅剥削产生的饥馑所引起的不断的反抗与斗争，都反映出当时此地劳动人民的“本质要求”。但是武训面对这么伟大的革命浪潮，却能“无动于中”，完全满足于“背着褡子满街溜”，“自有善人管我饭”的行乞生活。他在受庠生家的欺侮后，愤而兴学，并不想革庠生的命，只是想如何能够不再受庠生的气。他以为穷人认识字，便可以与地主富绅“看齐”了。这种念头是由幼年羡慕地主孩子可以念书“上进”发展而来的，不过通过在庠生家的一段生活把它更加深刻化罢了。
    至于武训兴学并非专为自己也是事实，他的歌里便有“为众家”，“为贫寒”的词句。但这种“为众家”，“为贫寒”的观念不仅模糊，而且含有很深的反动毒素。他不但自己甘心情愿做为统治阶级服务的奴才，而且还希望贫寒子弟也去读圣贤书，把他们从劳动人民的战线上硬引导到相反的做奴才的道路上来。他对当时的封建秩序肯定到一种惊人的程度。最显著的例子是：他做牛做马放债收租办了义学，请教书先生与绅董吃酒时，自己却“屏立门外，俟宴罢，啜其余曰：我乞者，不能与师抗礼也”。对于地主士绅的信任与效忠也达到了无可复加的程度。自己“积铢累寸，设学三州县，宅舍经费，倩首事董理之，已绝不过问”，而每天，他自己在义学里所做的工作只是：“惟师生有惰者，则长跪其前”。
    武训的“奇迹”是与代表封建地主的统治阶级的撑持与“表扬”不可分的。它之所以成为“奇迹”，正因为它适合了地主士绅的要求。道光四五年时，湖广总督李鸿宾的一封奏章上就很明白地说出当时统治阶级对义学的看法：
    “湖北襄阳一郡，界连豫省，民俗犷悍。臣李鸿宾于道光肆年春谕襄阳府知府周凯，督令所属州县，劝谕绅耆于乡村市镇多设义学，访延端谨儒流，诱掖子弟，使之入学诵读，以冀化导有方。”（道光题本）
    后来杨进士，郭知县以及张巡抚与袁巡抚的表扬武训，基本上是根据这种精神而来的。同时就当时劳动人民卑视统治者的“忠孝廉节”的宣传，喜爱自己“犯上作乱”的英雄故事，也可以看出劳动人民在文化战线上所具有的阶级感情。如谭瀛室笔记上说：
    （同治年间）“愚民尠识，遂以犯上作乱之事，视为寻常；地方官漠不关心，方以盗案奸情，纷歧叠出，殊不知忠孝廉节之事，千百人教之而未见为功，奸盗诈伪之书，一二人道之而立萌其祸，风俗与人心，相为表里。”
    这种阶级感情说明许多劳动人民虽不识字，但“一二人道之而立萌其祸”的情况是与武训的不识字而劝人读圣贤书截然不同的。同时也可以说明武训认识的错误决不仅仅是“不识字”的问题。
    在武训与一般劳动人民之间是存在两种不同的思想意识的。
  四
    现在我们可以进一步检讨“武训精神”中最反动的，落后的思想根源了。
    要说明武训为什么甘心三十年为统治者作牛马，应先了解什么是反动的封建道德观念的具体内容。所谓反动的封建道德观念，实际上包含着封建地主的“剥削”思想与拥护这种“剥削”的“奴才”思想两方面，而武训正是以他的“良心”，“真神”“阴骘”，“报应”之类的宿命论来肯定当时的封建秩序的合理，以甘心作牛作马的态度与地主的奴役压榨相结合起来。
    儒家“纲常”观与佛家“因果”观是互为表里的，在儒家的“孝道”里常含有宗教的内容。这一点，在武训的思想与行动上也充分地表现出来：
    “南里北里去烧香，不如家里去敬娘。这人好，这人好，我给十亩还嫌少。这人孝，这人孝，给他十亩好养老。”
    自然这种奴才思想还常表现着另外的一面，就是跪在统治者面前，企图“向上爬”的种种幻想。这种幻想最初曾出现在武训羡慕地主孩子能念书的意识里，后来它又被转化为对兴“义学”的强烈要求，因而不惜干尽了最卑下和最龌龊的行为中。
    马克思在法兰西阶级斗争一书中对这种“路死路埋，街死街埋”的游民，曾作过这样的痛斥：
    “他们是以社会的残屑为生活，并没有一定的职业；是流浪人，既没有炉火，又没有信义；他们虽然是随其隶属的国家的文明程度之高低而有所不同，但决不会丧失其流氓根性；……他们能够干最英勇的行为和最高尚的牺牲，但也能够干最卑下的偷盗和最龌龊的败德行为。”
    而武训的一生事迹正是在完成这种“最高尚的牺牲”与“最龌龊的败德行为”。
    但对于这种反动的“武训精神”，还有人这样来称赞：“毕竟他那种坚强的毅力与刻苦精神是值得学习的”，最近更有人根据这种“精神”作了进一步的发挥，就是：“武训的牺牲精神是惊人的，它与一个伟大的革命者的牺牲精神有共通性的，如果武训把他的‘坚强毅力’与‘刻苦精神’转移到革命方面来，一定会成为一个伟大的革命者。”
    这种孤立起来看“精神”，强调“精神”是唯心的，它没有理解到精神是不能离开其实践基础而存在的。武训精神之所以存在，正因为他在通过行乞的社会实践中接受了一套最反动的，落后的，消极的“奴才”哲学，如果他离开了这种思想与实践基础，便会完全无“毅力”去替统治者做三十年的牛马！劳动人民只能创造像闯王、闯将、黑旋风之类的英雄人物，不会创造武训这种三十年做牛做马的“奇迹”。
  五
    肯定“武训精神”的人，实际上是在肯定反动的封建道德观念，这些人是“以丑为美”的。他们未能看出武训的丑恶正如同武训未能看出自己的丑恶一样。自然其中的分别还是有的，因为他们以武训的牛马生活为苦事，为“奇迹”，而武训自己却甘之如饴，认为“路死路埋，街死街埋，死了自有棺材”。他们虽然了解了统治者的“表扬”，却似乎还没有很好地体会武训的“奴才”精神！
    在残存的封建毒素还没有完全从我们中间清除以前，总会有一些人是不能完全忘情于“武训精神”的。
