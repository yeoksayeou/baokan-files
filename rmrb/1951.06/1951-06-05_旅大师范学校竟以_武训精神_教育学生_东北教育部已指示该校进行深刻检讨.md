　　Lüda Normal School Actually Uses "Wu Xun Spirit" to Educate Students
    Northeast Education Department Instructs the School to Conduct a Thorough Self-Criticism
    Since the beginning of this semester, Lüda Normal School in Lüda City has mistakenly used the "Wu Xun Spirit" to conduct ideological education among students. The school reported Wu Xun's deeds to the students, advocated Wu Xun's "tenacious spirit" of begging for alms to establish schools, hung Wu Xun's portrait in front of the school gate, and planned to build a "Wu Xun Pavilion" in the school. These situations fully reflect the confusion in the school's educational ideology and have already caused a very bad influence on the thinking of teachers and all students.
    When the Northeast People's Government Education Department sent people to inspect the school's work in April, it verbally expressed its opinions to the responsible comrades of the Lüda Culture and Education Bureau on the morning of April 27, pointing out that it was wrong to educate normal school students with the "Wu Xun Spirit," hoping that the Culture and Education Bureau would convey this opinion to Lüda Normal School, and asking them to take down Wu Xun's portrait as soon as possible to avoid continuing to influence students. However, as of May 20, the school still had not taken down Wu Xun's portrait, and the school leaders and faculty members had not conducted a self-criticism on the Wu Xun issue. From this, it can be seen that Lüda Normal School's attitude towards criticizing the Wu Xun issue is not serious enough. Recently, the Northeast People's Government Education Department, based on the call from the Beijing People's Daily and the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch a criticism of the errors in the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the spirit of Wu Xun, instructed the responsible comrades of the Lüda Culture and Education Bureau and Lüda Normal School to conduct a thorough self-criticism of this error, criticize the error, and improve the political theory and educational ideology level of cadres. The letter of instruction specifically pointed out: "1. The president and vice-president of Lüda Normal School are responsible for thoroughly criticizing the ideological and viewpoint errors existing in the school's education when explaining and introducing Wu Xun, and analyzing the reasons for these errors in the school. 2. Lüda Normal School should seriously and realistically estimate what adverse effects have been produced by mistakenly advocating the 'Wu Xun Spirit' among students and teachers, and take concrete steps in light of the actual situation, launch ideological debates, and openly criticize errors to reverse the influence. 3. The Culture and Education Bureau should understand and check whether there are also erroneous ideas about the 'Wu Xun Spirit' in the Lüda education circle (especially among primary school teachers) due to the promotion of the 'Wu Xun Spirit' by Lüda Normal School. If so, the same methods should be adopted to solve these ideological problems. At the same time, we hope that the Lüda Culture and Education Bureau will examine the shortcomings that existed in the past in ideological leadership work, and consider what specific measures should be taken in the future to strengthen leadership and improve the political and theoretical level and educational ideology level of cadres."

　　旅大师范学校竟以“武训精神”教育学生
    东北教育部已指示该校进行深刻检讨
    旅大市旅大师范学校，本学期开学以来，曾错误地以“武训精神”在学生中进行思想教育。该校曾向学生报告武训的事迹，提倡武训行乞兴学的“坚韧精神”，将武训的画像悬挂于校门之前，并计划在学校中修筑一座“武训亭”。这些情况，充分地反映了该校教育思想的混乱，已在教师及全体学生思想上造成很坏的影响。
    东北人民政府教育部在四月份派人视察该校工作时，曾于四月二十七日上午向旅大文教局负责同志口头提出意见，指出以“武训精神”教育师范学生是错误的，希望文教局将这意见转告旅大师范，并请他们尽快将武训画像取下，以免继续影响学生。但直到五月二十日，该校仍未将武训画像取下，学校负责人及教职员对武训问题，亦未进行检讨。由此可以看出，旅大师范对待批判武训问题的态度，是不够严肃认真的。东北人民政府教育部最近又根据北京人民日报及中共中央东北局宣传部关于号召展开对电影《武训传》的错误及武训的精神的批判，指示旅大文教局及旅大师范学校负责同志对此错误进行深刻的检讨，批判错误，以提高干部政治理论及教育思想水平。指示信中具体指出：“一、责成旅大师范校长、副校长深刻地批判该校在教育中，讲解介绍武训时思想、观点上所存在的错误，并分析该校产生这些错误的原因。二、旅大师范应认真切实地估计，由于错误地在学生、教师中提倡了‘武训精神’，已产生了那些不良影响，并针对实际情形，采取具体步骤，展开思想争论，公开地批判错误，以挽回影响。三、文教局应了解和检查，由于旅大师范的提倡‘武训精神’，在旅大教育界（特别是小学教师中），是否也存在着对“武训精神”的错误思想，如有，亦应采取同样的办法，解决这些思想问题。同时，希望旅大文教局检查过去在思想领导工作上所存在的缺点，并考虑今后应采取何种具体办法加强领导，以提高干部的政治理论水平与教育思想水平。”
