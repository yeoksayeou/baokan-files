　　The First Year the People Along the Huai River Overcame the Huai River Disaster

    Along the thousand-mile Huai River harnessing line, our hardworking and brave people are actively fighting against natural disasters. They have already achieved brilliant victories and written a glorious and splendid page of history.

    On the south levee of Zhengyangguan in Shou County, worker Wang Shanqing, comparing the present with the past, told me about the corruption of the Kuomintang reactionary government's "Huai River management." He said, "In the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932], a Huai River Diversion Association was established in Zhengyangguan. The people thought that the Huai River was really going to be managed, and they were all very happy. Who knew that the personnel of the Huai River Diversion Association put up a signboard and did nothing, spending their days eating, drinking, and gambling, causing many more brothels to open in Zhengyangguan. Of course, they also did 'work' like surveying and mapping, but construction was never seen to begin. Floods came every year, making people miserable. One autumn, the people ran to the Huai River Diversion Association to petition. The people at the association said, 'Diverting the Huai River is indeed very important, but we still need to ask for approval from higher authorities.' After a long time, there was still no action. The people went to petition again, and they became angry. In the twelfth lunar month of that year, during a time of great wind and snow, they deliberately called the people to the levee. Many people got sick and froze to death. The people asked to start construction on a sunny day, but they refused. They even scolded the people, saying, 'Hooligans! You ask for construction to start, and then you ask for it to stop. Are you deliberately causing trouble!' After that, the people didn't dare to petition anymore, they just paid the Huai River management fee every year. If all the Huai River management fees paid by the people were put together, we could have built the Huai levee even with flour." Wang Shanqing paused, his bright eyes looking at the south levee under construction, and a shining smile suddenly appeared on his face. He said, "Now it's different from before, Chairman Mao does what he says. Not only is the Huai River being repaired, but work is also being provided as a form of relief, to alleviate the famine." He concluded, "The Kuomintang's management of the Huai River was to deceive the people; the People's Government's management of the Huai River is truly for the people."

    I have visited many workers, and everyone has the same understanding. This understanding has given them firm confidence in the future of the Huai River management, inspiring them to put forth their greatest strength and strive for the final victory of the Huai River management.

    The people along the Huai River have suffered from floods for a long time, and their lives are very difficult. When they first went to the levee, many people did not have tools for river management, nor did they have mats to build work sheds. Some people didn't have quilts to cover themselves, and they couldn't even afford food and drink for the journey. However, difficulties could not stop them. They collected earthen cannons, knives, and spears, and forged them into shovels for digging soil; they saved relief grain or sold local products in exchange for picks and grappling hooks for digging sand and gravel. In villages severely affected by the flood, when the trees were all submerged and there were no willow branches to weave earth baskets, they braved the severe cold to go into the water, fished out reeds, and carried them to lightly affected villages dozens of miles away to exchange for earth baskets. Without quilts, they helped each other. The men from two families went to the levee and shared a quilt. The women and children from two families shared a quilt at home. Other difficulties were also resolved through mutual borrowing and mutual aid. In this way, they finally overcame the difficulties and went to the Huai levee.

    During the winter repair period, the severe cold and frozen ground made the hardship of the project imaginable. But they did not show the slightest timidity. The heroic deeds of Zhai Shilin, a special-class labor model from Lingbi County, who went into the water to repair the water pump, are a reflection of the iron will of thousands of workers. In the Lingbi County work section, the lotus root nozzle of the water pump that draws water was blocked by mud and weeds, preventing the pump from drawing water, which hindered the progress of the soil extraction project. The lotus root nozzle was placed at the bottom of three-meter-deep water and had to be repaired by diving into the water. At this time, the cold wind was piercing, and thin ice had formed on the water surface, making it very difficult to work in the water. However, the heroic Zhai Shilin silently thought: the crops have been flooded for six or seven years, and the stone roller has not been turned over (meaning no grain has been ground). Now that Chairman Mao is leading the management of the Huai River, and there is hope for this year's crops, what does it matter if we suffer a little! So, regardless of everything, he drank a few bowls of ginger tea, took off his cotton clothes, broke the ice, and dived into the water. The first time he came up from the water to breathe, his whole body was frozen like a red shrimp, but the work was not finished, so he dived into the water again. The second time he came up to breathe, his whole body was numb with cold, and his skin turned purplish-red, but the work was still not finished, so he dived into the water again. He gritted his teeth and dived into the water twenty-eight times in a row, finally removing all the mud and weeds blocking the lotus root nozzle, and getting the water pump working again.

    When the spring repair started, new difficulties were encountered: the men have all gone to the levee, what about the spring plowing in the villages? At this time, millions of women along the Huai River replaced the men and went to the front lines of spring plowing. They organized mutual aid teams and did all the work that men had done in previous years. Without livestock, they used human power to pull the plow and cultivate the land. Some backward women were unwilling to "show their faces" in the fields, and some even said that pulling the plow was not something that humans should do. Others asked them, "Who is Chairman Mao calling for the management of the Huai River for?" This question awakened these women who couldn't understand: if they didn't do it, and pulled their men back from the levee to work in the fields, it would cause them endless disasters in the future!

    As the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea deepened on the Huai levee, the vast number of Huai River management workers demonstrated even greater enthusiasm and creativity. Labor efficiency was further improved.

    In Yingshang County, Zou Kunhai, a Huai River management team leader, created a new method for carrying earth, which greatly increased the speed of carrying earth. This labor model had a very tragic past. In the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits broke open the Huayuankou Yellow River levee, when the Yellow River water rushed to his hometown, his family of eighteen fled from the famine, thirteen of whom starved to death, died of illness, or were killed by Japanese devils. After telling this tragic experience at a grievance meeting, he resolutely told his team members: "I must build the dam (i.e., repair the levee) as soon as possible, produce more grain, and support the resistance against America and aid to Korea, and never let the American imperialists send Chiang Kai-shek bandits and Japanese devils back!" He originally used baskets to carry earth, and could only carry two or three cubic meters a day, which was not very efficient. He studied the reasons, mainly because the baskets were large and bulky, and it was a waste of energy for two people to carry them. So, he invented a method of weaving bamboo baskets to carry earth. Bamboo baskets are more than half as light as baskets, and it is convenient and quick for one person to carry them back and forth. He also created a "relay" method of transporting earth, which greatly improved the efficiency of long-distance earth transportation. Zou Kunhai's team of forty-three people increased the average efficiency of carrying earth to 5.02 cubic meters per person per day, with the highest reaching 8.2 cubic meters (the general average efficiency is three to four cubic meters), creating a new record for carrying earth along the Huai River.

    Along the Huai River management line in northern Anhui, excellent workers implemented ramming in the construction of the levee, ensuring that the project met standards. In the past, the Kuomintang government did not ram the Huai River levee, and the levee body was loose, soft, and weak, and would break when washed by water. Now the workers have learned from the past and unanimously put forward conditions to ensure that the project meets the standards in the patriotic convention. They first used wooden ramming tools to ram the levee, and the levee body was stronger than in the past, but because the wooden ramming tools were too light, the levee body was still not very strong. Later, the workers displayed their wisdom and created stone ramming tools. The heaviest stone ramming tools weighed up to 120 pounds. After ramming, the levee body was very solid. However, hard Magang soil was often encountered in some places, and the stone ramming tools could not completely crush the soil. The Chenying team used stone rollers weighing 300 to 400 pounds to ram the soil, which overcame all difficulties.

    For hundreds of years, whenever the Huai River flood came, the people along the Huai River fled in batches. Today, when the regime is in the hands of the people themselves, they are no longer passively avoiding natural disasters, but are engaged in an unyielding struggle. This is an epoch-making change, and it is the beginning of the people along the Huai River moving towards a happy future.

　　沿淮人民战胜淮患的第一年
    本报记者　古维进
    在千里治淮线上，我国勤劳勇敢的人民，积极与自然灾害作斗争。已获得辉煌的胜利，写下了光辉灿烂的史页。
    在寿县正阳关南堤，民工王善清抚今思昔，向我谈起过去国民党反动政府“治淮”时的腐败情形。他说：“民国二十一年，正阳关设立了导淮分会，老百姓以为真要治淮了，都很高兴。谁知道导淮人员挂起招牌不作事，成天吃喝嫖赌，弄得正阳关的妓院增加了许多家。当然，他们也做了测量绘图之类的‘工作’，但是老不见动工。大水年年淹，把人都淹苦啦。有一年秋天，老百姓跑到导淮分会去请愿。分会的人说：‘导淮的确很重要，不过还要请示上级批准。’过了好长时候，还是不见动静。老百姓又去请愿，他们就发火了。在那年十冬腊月，大风大雪的时候，他们故意叫老百姓上堤。许多人冻病了，冻死了。老百姓要求晴天动工，他们不答应。还大骂老百姓说：‘混蛋！要求动工，又要求停工，这不是存心捣乱！’这以后，老百姓再也不敢请愿了，只是每年缴纳治淮费。要是把老百姓缴的治淮费都凑合起来，咱们用洋面也把淮堤打起来了。”王善清稍停了停，一双明亮的眼睛望着正在施工的南堤，脸上忽然闪出光泽的笑容。他说：“现在和从前不一样了，毛主席是说干就干。不但修了淮河，还要以工代赈，救济灾荒。”他最后像作结论似的说：“国民党治淮，是哄骗老百姓的；人民政府治淮，是真正为老百姓的。”
    我访问过许多民工，大家都是这样认识。这一认识，使他们对治淮的前途有了坚定的信心，激励他们拿出最大的力量，为治淮的最后胜利而奋斗。
    沿淮人民因长期遭受水患，生活非常困苦。开始上堤时，许多人没有治河的工具，没有搭工棚的席子。有些人没有被子盖，甚至连路上的吃喝也带不起。但是，困难不能阻止他们，他们收集土炮、刀矛，打成挖土的铁锹；节省救济粮或卖掉土产，换取挖砂礓的洋镐、抓钩。在水灾严重的村庄，树木淹完，编土筐没有柳条，他们便冒着严寒下水，捞起苲草，背到数十里外的轻灾乡换土筐。没有被子，就互助解决。两家的男人上堤合带一床被。两家的女人小孩在家合盖一床被。其他困难，也以互借互济的方法解决了。这样，他们终于战胜困难，走上淮堤。
    冬修期间，天寒地冻，工程的艰苦是可以想见的。但他们没有表现丝毫畏缩。灵璧县特等劳动模范翟士林下水修理抽水机的英勇事迹，就是千万民工的钢铁意志的缩影。在灵璧县工段，抽水机吸水的莲蓬嘴被泥沙和杂草堵塞，不能抽水，妨碍取土工程的进行。莲蓬嘴安放在三公尺深的水底，必须钻进水中修理。这时寒风凛冽，水上已结薄冰，钻到水中工作是很困难的。但是，英勇的翟士林默默地想着：庄家被水淹了六七年，石磙没有翻过身（即没有碾过粮食）。现在毛主席领导治淮，眼看今年的庄稼有了指望，我们吃点苦算什么呢！于是，他不顾一切，喝了几碗姜茶，脱掉棉衣，拨开冰块，便钻进水里去了。第一次从水中浮起换气时，浑身冻得像红虾，但是工作没有完成，他又钻进水里。第二次浮起换气时，浑身冻得发麻，肌肤变成紫红色，但工作还是没有完成，他又钻进水里。他咬紧牙关，一连下水二十八次，终于把堵塞莲蓬嘴的泥沙和杂草全部掏出，使抽水机活动起来。
    春修开始时，新的困难摆在面前：男人都上了堤，村里的春耕生产怎么办呢？这时候，沿淮数百万妇女代替男子走上春耕生产的战线。她们组织了互助组，做着往年男人担任的一切活。没有牲口，就用人拉犁的方法耕地。有些落后的妇女不肯“抛头露面”下田，有些人还说拉犁不是人干的活。别人问她们：“毛主席号召治淮为了谁？”这一问，把这些想不通的妇女问醒了：自己如果不干，把男人从堤上拉回来下田，就会造成自己将来无穷的灾害呀！
    当抗美援朝的爱国运动深入淮堤的时候，广大治淮民工更发扬了高度的积极性和创造性。劳动效率进一步提高了。
    在颍上县，治淮民工分队长邹坤海创造了挑土的新办法，使挑土的速度大大提高。这位劳动模范，过去的遭遇是十分悲惨的。民国二十七年蒋匪扒开花园口黄河大堤，黄水冲到他家乡的时候，他一家十八口人出外逃荒，其中十三口都饿死、病死或被日本鬼子杀死了。他在诉苦大会上诉出这一段悲惨遭遇之后，坚决向队员们表示：“我一定要尽快打好坝子（即修好堤），多打粮食，支援抗美援朝，决不让美帝国主义再把蒋匪和日本鬼子送回来！”他原来是用筐子抬土，一天只能抬二、三方，效率不高。他研究原因，主要是筐子大而笨重，两个人抬浪费力气。于是，他发明了用竹子编织箕子挑土的办法。竹箕子比筐子轻一倍多，一人一挑，来回轻便迅速。他又创造了“接力”运土的办法，大大提高了远距离运土的效率。邹坤海分队四十三个人，每人每天挑土的平均效率提高到五·○二公方，最高达到八·二公方（一般平均效率为三、四公方），创造了治淮沿线挑土的新纪录。
    在皖北治淮沿线，优秀的民工们在筑堤中实行打硪，保证了工程合于标准。过去国民党政府筑淮堤不打硪，堤身稀松软无力，被水一冲就破。现在民工接受过去的教训，在爱国公约上一致提出保证工程合乎标准的条件。他们首先以木片硪打堤，堤身比较过去结实了，但因木片硪份量太轻，堤身仍不十分坚固。以后民工们发扬智慧，又创造了石片硪。最重的石片硪达一百二十斤，行硪以后，堤身就很坚实了。但有的地方经常遇见坚硬的马岗土，石片硪不能完全把土打碎，陈郢中队又以三、四百斤重的石磙行硪，这就把所有困难都克服了。
    数百年来，沿淮人民每当淮河水灾到来，都是一批一批外出逃荒。今天，当政权掌在人民自己手里的时候，他们对于自然灾害已经不是消极的躲避，而是不屈不挠的斗争了。这是一个划时代的变化，这是沿淮人民走向幸福的未来的开端。
