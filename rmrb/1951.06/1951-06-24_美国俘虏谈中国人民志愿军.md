　　American POWs Talk About the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    American aggressor soldiers and officers captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean War, based on their own experiences, realized that although the American army possesses superior equipment and technology, it will never be able to defeat the brave, resourceful, and noble-minded Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Whenever the subject of night battles comes up, American POWs immediately recall the "terrifying and shudder-inducing night" when they were captured. Private Harris, a first-class soldier in K Company, 24th Regiment, 25th Division of the U.S. Army, was captured on the night of April 24th, about four miles north of the 38th parallel. He said: "Many of my comrades were killed, but I was lucky to survive. The night of April 24th was my last terrifying night, because I was captured that night. Our entire company was afraid of being surrounded, so we groped our way down the mountain to the road, but as soon as we reached the road, we were already surrounded. Gunfire was everywhere, and it was very dark, so our entire company was thrown into chaos. We didn't know where the platoon leader or company commander had gone. I ran forward, and I heard Chinese people speaking; I ran backward, and I still heard Chinese people speaking; I wanted to go back up the mountain, but there were Chinese people there too. We wandered around in your encirclement for four hours. I saw fewer and fewer of our people alive, and I escaped into a small ditch, but I was still captured."

    One of the "advantages" of the American army is that it "retreats quickly," but many people were still taken prisoner after their retreat was cut off. Private Clarence, a first-class soldier in E Company, 21st Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, was captured on April 27th. His first platoon had a total of thirty-seven people. At five o'clock that morning, they were surrounded by the Volunteer Army on a small hill. After a brief battle, the entire platoon was wiped out, with twenty-seven people captured, six wounded, and four killed. He said, "You divided and surrounded all four platoons of our company, making it impossible for us to support each other with fire, and it was impossible for each platoon to contact each other." Thompson, a medic from I Company, 5th Regiment of the same division, said, "On April 22nd, I sent several wounded soldiers to our rear C Company, but who knew that C Company's retreat had already been cut off by you. Their company commander was killed, and only two of the four platoon leaders were left. I hurriedly turned back to our company's position, but it was impossible to get through. Our company was also surrounded. You did a really great job!"

    Enemy tank units were also often cut off and annihilated. Seven 46-ton tanks from D Company of the 6th Tank Battalion of the 24th U.S. Division were destroyed on April 25th, about ten miles south of the 38th parallel. Captured tank gunner Reibe described the battle as follows: "The Chinese way of fighting was something I had never heard of before. Our giant tanks drove into the traps you had set, and we didn't even know it. As soon as the gunfire started, we knew something was wrong. When we wanted to retreat, our retreat was blocked by your fire. Your mortar shells rained down on our tanks, the radio was destroyed, and I lost contact with our platoon leader. We were hit by shells and couldn't stay in the tank anymore, so we crawled out of the vehicle. The scene before our eyes was: burning trucks, the dazzling flames of exploding mortar shells, and Chinese volunteer soldiers carrying grenades to blow up the tank treads. I knew that there was no hope of resistance, so I raised my hands in surrender. At this time, I saw you bandaging the wounds of my platoon leader, Lieutenant Xia Chen, and I realized that he had also been captured. Infantry plus mortars annihilated a heavy tank company. This is something I had never heard of before."

    American POWs always use the phrase "unimaginable" to describe the bravery and resourcefulness of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Every American soldier captured in the battles on both sides of the Han River can tell two or three stories of volunteer soldiers bravely fighting while defending a hill. After telling these stories, they always say, "This is unimaginable. American soldiers would never dare to do this." Deaken, a platoon leader of the 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion of the U.S. Army, was forced to surrender by the amazing bravery and courage of the Volunteer Army soldiers. He said, "Several soldiers of the Chinese Volunteer Army rushed straight down from the mountain. They quickly ran up to me. At that time, I still had weapons in my hand, but they took my weapons and threw them on the ground." He said, "I was simply stunned at the time and completely forgot to fire my gun. I think I was overwhelmed by the courage of those Chinese soldiers. That's how I became their prisoner."

    The Volunteer Army warriors, who fight for justice, are as brave as lions in battle, but they are magnanimous towards enemies who have laid down their weapons. This noble quality moved many prisoners to tears. Major Flemin, a U.S. military advisor in the puppet 6th Division, timidly raised his trembling hands when Volunteer Army soldiers rushed towards him. He was worried that the Volunteer Army soldiers would retaliate against him, but the Volunteer Army soldiers gestured to him to indicate that they would not beat him or kill him, and took him to a safe bunker until the battle was over before taking him off the battlefield. Flemin said, "In my long military career, this is the first time I have encountered such a brave and respectable army that takes such good care of the safety of prisoners."

    At a discussion meeting of captured American officers, these officers came to the conclusion: "Although the American army possesses superior equipment, it will never be able to defeat the brave Koreans and Chinese." (Attached picture)

　　美国俘虏谈中国人民志愿军
    新华社记者  邓蜀生
    在朝鲜战争中被中国人民志愿军俘掳的美国侵略军的官兵们，根据他们自己的经验，认识到美国军队虽然拥有优势的装备和技术，却是永远无法战胜勇敢机智和具有崇高品质的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的。
    一谈到打夜战，美国俘虏们就立刻回忆到自己被俘的那一个“使人惊悸发抖的恐怖之夜”。美军第二十五师二十四团Ｋ连上等兵哈里斯，是四月二十四日夜间在北纬三十八度线以北约四英里处被俘的。他说：“多少同伴被打死了；我却仍然幸运地活着。四月二十四日的夜晚是我最后的一个恐怖之夜，因为我在这一个夜晚被俘了。我们全连害怕被包围，就从山头上摸索着走下公路，可是刚走下公路就已经被包围了。四处都是枪声，天又黑得很，我们一个连就混乱了；我们都不知道排长、连长到那里去了。我往前面跑，听见有中国人说话，往后面跑，还是有中国人说话；想再回到山上，山上也是中国人。我们就在你们的包围圈里团团地转了四个钟头。我看见我们的人活着的越来越少，我自己逃到一条小沟里还是被俘了。”
    美国军队的“优点”之一是“逃得快”，可是许多人却仍然在被截断后路以后当了俘虏。美军第二十四师二十一团Ｅ连的上等兵克劳伦斯是四月二十七日被俘的。他所在的第一排共有三十七个人。那天早晨五点钟，他们被志愿军包围在一个小山头上，只经过短暂的战斗，这个排就被全部歼灭，其中二十七个人被俘，六个人受伤，四个人被打死。他说：“你们把我们全连四个排分割包围了，使我们无法以火力互相支援，各排想取得联系也不可能。”该师第五团Ｉ连的医务员汤普生说：“四月二十二日我送几个伤兵到我们后面的Ｃ连去，谁知道Ｃ连的后路早被你们截断了。他们的连长被打死了，四个排长只剩下两个。我急忙再回头向本连阵地走，走不通了，我们这一连也被包围了。你们干得真漂亮！”
    敌人的坦克部队，也经常被截断了后路而被歼灭。美军二十四师第六坦克营Ｄ连的七辆四十六吨重的坦克，就是在四月二十五日在北纬三十八度线以南约十里处被击毁的。被俘的坦克射手芮北描述这一次战斗的情形说：“中国人的打法是我从来没有听说过的。我们的巨型坦克闯进了你们预置的陷阱，我们自己还不知道。等到枪声一响，我们知道不妙，想往回走时，后路已被你们用火力封锁住了。你们的迫击炮弹像一阵骤雨似地落在我们坦克上，无线电被打坏了，我和我们的排长失掉了联络。我们被炮弹打得不能再呆在坦克里面，就钻出车来，一看眼前的景象是：燃烧着的卡车，耀眼的迫击炮弹爆炸的火光，和提着手榴弹炸坦克履带的中国志愿军。我知道再抵抗是没有希望的了，就举手投降。这时我看见你们在替我的排长夏晨中尉包扎伤口，我才知道他也被俘了。步兵加上迫击炮，竟把重坦克连歼灭了，这是我从来没有听说过的。”
    美国俘虏总是用“不可想像”这句话来描述中国人民志愿军的勇敢和机智。在汉江南北两岸战斗中被俘的美国兵，每个人都能讲出志愿军两三个勇士据守一个山头英勇作战的故事。他们在讲完之后总是说：“这是不可想像的，美国兵从来不敢这样干法。”美军第二化学迫击炮营的一个排长德肯是被志愿军战士惊人的勇敢和魄力逼降的。他说：“中国志愿军的几个战士从山上直冲下来，他们迅速地跑到我面前，那时我手中还有武器，他们把我的武器夺下来就往地下一扔。”他说：“我当时简直是呆了，根本忘了放枪。我想我是被那几个中国人的勇气慑服了。就这样我成了他们的俘虏。”
    为正义而战的志愿军勇士们打起仗来勇猛得好像狮子，可是对待放下了武器的敌人却是宽大的。这种崇高的品质使很多俘虏感动万分。在伪第六师当顾问的美军少校弗来敏，在志愿军战士冲到他面前时胆怯地举起了发抖的双手，他担心志愿军战士对他采取报复行动，可是志愿军战士却向他作手势表示不打他不杀他，并且把他带到一个安全的掩体里，直到战斗结束后才把他带下战场。弗来敏说：“在我长期的军事生涯中，我第一次遇见这样勇敢而且如此照顾俘虏安全的使人敬佩的军队。”
    在一次被俘的美国军官的座谈会上，这些军官们作出了这样的一个结论：“美国军队虽然拥有优势装备，却永远不能战胜勇敢的朝鲜人和中国人的。”（附图片）
