　　We are now recuperating in Hangzhou's West Lake and will work harder when we return to our production posts
    ——A letter from the first group of convalescing workers in the Shanghai area of the Railway Union

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　Since the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in February this year, we, the working class, have had the most reliable guarantee in our lives. The Labor Insurance Regulations are one of the fruits of victory won by the great Chinese Communist Party led by you and the heroic and unyielding martyrs through thirty years of resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism. At the same time, all facilities beneficial to the working class have been gradually realized in our Shanghai Railway area. Things that we had never heard of before and could not even imagine are now being personally experienced by us. Hangzhou's West Lake is a world-famous scenic spot, and in the past, our working class would never have been able to come here to play in their lifetime. However, today, our district union has set up a sanatorium here for us. The forty-three labor heroes, model workers, and advanced group representatives of our Shanghai Sub-Committee were the first to come here for recuperation from the 7th to the 12th of this month. We all deeply remember that this glory was given to us by Chairman Mao. We will never forget the benefits brought to us by the Communist Party. In order to preserve the fruits of victory and protect the long-term interests of the working class, we firmly guarantee to you: After returning to our production posts, we will definitely better complete the production and transportation tasks, use our wisdom, put forward rational proposals for saving materials, saving labor, and reducing costs, and use practical actions to do a good job in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, to repay Chairman Mao.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

　　我们现在正在杭州西湖休养回到生产岗位要更努力工作
    ——铁路工会上海区首批休养员的信敬爱的毛主席：
    自从今年二月劳动保险条例公布以后，我们工人阶级生活有了最可靠的保障。劳动保险条例是您所领导的伟大的中国共产党和英勇不屈的先烈们对国民党反动派及帝国主义经过三十年的坚决斗争换取来的胜利果实之一。与这同时，一切对工人阶级有利益的设施，在我们上海铁路区内逐步实现了。我们以前闻所未闻想也想不到的事情，今天我们亲身领受到了。杭州西湖是天下闻名的风景区，从前我们工人阶级一辈子也不会到这里来玩的。然而今天，我们的区工会在这里为我们设置了休养所。我们上海分区委员会的四十三名功臣劳动模范和先进小组代表，从本月七日至十二日首先到这里休养了。我们大家都深深地记住，这个光荣是毛主席给我们的。我们怎样也不会忘记了共产党带给我们的好处。为了保持胜利果实，保护工人阶级的长远利益，我们坚决地向您提出保证：我们回到生产岗位后，一定更好地完成生产运输任务，发挥智慧，提出节约省料省工减低成本的合理建议，用实际行动来做好抗美援朝、镇压反革命的工作，报答毛主席。中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
