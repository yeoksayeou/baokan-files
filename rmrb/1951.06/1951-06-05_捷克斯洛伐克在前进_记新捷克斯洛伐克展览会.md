　　Czechoslovakia Marches Forward
    ——A Record of the New Czechoslovakia Exhibition
    By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui
    The "New Czechoslovakia Exhibition," which opened at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace on May 28th, is a large-scale and richly-detailed exhibition. This exhibition is a return gift from the Czechoslovak government for our "New China Exhibition" held in Prague a year ago. The exhibits on display include machines, pottery, porcelain, textiles, glassware, photographs, sculptures, puppet shows, oil paintings, woodcuts, cartoons, posters, models, and printed materials. The characteristic of this exhibition is that there are many physical objects, especially industrial products. Through the exhibits and photographs, we can see how Czechoslovakia has grown and developed in struggle, and how it has victoriously embarked on the road of socialist construction.

    Czechoslovakia was already a highly industrialized country before World War II. After the war, it successfully completed its Two-Year Plan and embarked on a new Five-Year Plan, and its industry has developed by leaps and bounds. Throughout the exhibition, we can see the achievements of Czechoslovakia's economic construction. Among the industrial products on display are complete modern lathes, streamlined automobiles, motorized bicycles, X-ray fluoroscopes, microscopes, measuring instruments, chemical analyzers, as well as models of machine tools and factory equipment. In the photographs, we can see countless factories and mines working intensely. Czechoslovak workers are learning the Soviet Stakhanovite work methods, launching shock movements and socialist competitions in various industrial sectors, and workers are enthusiastically signing socialist competition pacts. Czechoslovakia's achievements in economic construction have accumulated wealth for the country and created happiness for the people. In the photographs, we can see workers and farmers enjoying their vacations in beautiful garden-like sanatorium areas.

    In the exhibition, we can also see Czechoslovakia's brilliant achievements in cultural construction. The exhibition showcases oil paintings and sculptures with workers, peasants, and soldiers as themes, ingeniously designed puppet shows, photographs of dramas and movies, and beautifully printed books and magazines of all kinds.

    Czechoslovakia has grown through continuous and arduous struggles. In May 1921, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was born, leading the people's revolutionary struggle until victory. In the anti-fascist war alone, 25,000 Communist Party members gloriously sacrificed their lives, including the Czechoslovak people's hero and outstanding Communist Party member Julius Fučík (author of the famous "Report from the Gallows," winner of the International Peace Prize).

    On May 9, 1945, with the assistance of the powerful Soviet army, the people of Czechoslovakia liberated Prague, established their own people's government, and began to build their new life. However, the reactionaries were constantly undermining this new construction. But in the February events of 1948, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people finally crushed the conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionaries. This victory was a significant step for Czechoslovakia towards socialism.

    The people of Czechoslovakia, who are engaged in peaceful construction, love peace. They actively signed peace declarations and are strengthening the world's peace and democratic forces with new production achievements. The people of Prague warmly welcomed the delegates to the World Peace Congress; people everywhere held parades and demonstrations to protest against the American aggression in Korea; workers and peasants everywhere increased production to support the Korean people.

    The people of Czechoslovakia love the new China. One corner of the exhibition displays a portrait of Chairman Mao meticulously pieced together with magnetic blocks by Czechoslovak artists, cultural workers enthusiastically translating the works of our people's leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, as well as the works of our famous writers Mao Dun and Zhao Shuli, into Czech, stills from the performance of "The White-Haired Girl" in Prague, and photographs, woodcuts, and New Year pictures about the life of the Chinese people printed in various books, newspapers, and magazines.

    On the west wall of the exhibition hangs a huge oil painting entitled "The Victorious People," by the famous Czechoslovak painter Brunos. The oil painting depicts the powerful ranks of the victorious Czechoslovak working people, advancing along a broad road. This road is the great road of socialism. The entire exhibition tells us that today, the Czechoslovak people are marching forward along this broad road with full confidence! (Attached picture)

　　捷克斯洛伐克在前进
    ——记新捷克斯洛伐克展览会
    本报记者  程光锐
    从五月二十八日起在北京市劳动人民文化宫举行的“新捷克斯洛伐克展览会”，是一个规模很大、内容丰富的展览会。这个展览会是捷克斯洛伐克政府对我们一年前在布拉格举行的“新中国展览会”的答礼。展览会中陈列的展览品，括机器、陶器、瓷包器、纺织品、玻璃品、图片、雕塑、傀儡戏、油画、木刻、漫画、招贴、模型和印刷品等。这个展览会的特征是实物多，尤其是工业品多。通过展览会中的实物和图片，我们可以看到捷克斯洛伐克怎样在斗争中成长和发展，怎样胜利地走上社会主义建设的道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克在第二次世界大战前已经是高度工业化的国家，战后胜利地完成了两年计划并进行了新的五年计划，它的工业更是突飞猛晋地发展着。在展览会中我们随处都可以看到捷克斯洛伐克经济建设的成就。展览的工业品中，有整部的现代化的车床、流线型小汽车、机器脚踏车、爱克斯光透视机、显微镜、衡量器、化学分析机以及工作母机和工厂设备的模型。在图片中我们可以看到无数在紧张工作的工厂和矿坑，捷克斯洛伐克的工人们学习苏联斯塔哈诺夫式的工作方法，在工业的各部门中展开了突击运动和社会主义竞赛，工人们热烈签订社会主义竞赛公约。捷克斯洛伐克在经济建设上的成就，给国家积累了财富，给人民创造了幸福。在照片中，我们可以看到工人们和农民们在花园一样美丽的休养地区愉快地度着假期。
    在展览会中，我们还可以看到捷克斯洛伐克在文化建设上的光辉成就。展览中陈列着以工农兵为题材的油画、塑刻，设计巧妙的傀儡戏，话剧和电影的照片，以及印刷精美的各式各样的书籍和杂志。
    捷克斯洛伐克是在不断地艰苦的斗争中成长的。一九二一年五月，捷克共产党诞生了，它领导着人民的革命斗争直到胜利。仅仅在反法西斯战争中，就有二万五千名共产党员光荣地牺牲了，其中包括捷克斯洛伐克的人民英雄、优秀的共产党员尤利斯·伏契克（名著《绞索套着脖子时的报告》的作者，国际和平奖金荣誉奖的获奖人）。
    一九四五年五月九日，在强大的苏军的援助下，捷克斯洛伐克人民解放了布拉格，建立了人民自己的政府，开始建设自己的新生活。但是反动派是随时在破坏着这种新的建设的。但是在一九四八年二月事件中，在捷克共产党的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克人民终于击破了资产阶级反动派的阴谋。这个胜利是捷克斯洛伐克走向社会主义的意义重大的一步。
    在进行着和平建设的捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱着和平，他们踊跃地在和平宣言上签名；并以新的生产成就来加强世界和平民主力量。布拉格人民热情地迎接世界和平大会的代表；各地人民举行游行示威抗议美国侵略朝鲜；各地工人农民增加生产支援朝鲜人民。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民是热爱新中国的。展览会的一角陈列着捷克斯洛伐克艺术家用磁块精心拼制的毛主席像，文化工作者们热心用捷文翻译的我国人民领袖毛主席、刘少奇同志的著作和我国著名作家茅盾、赵树理等的作品，《白毛女》在布拉格上演的剧照，以及刊印在各种书报和杂志上的关于中国人民生活的照片、木刻和年画。
    展览会的西墙上挂着一幅题名《胜利的人民》的巨幅油画，这是捷克斯洛伐克名画家布诺斯的作品。油画中描绘了胜利的捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的强大的队伍，正沿着一条宽阔的道路前进。这条道路，就是社会主义的大道。整个展览会告诉我们：今天，捷克斯洛伐克人民正沿着这条宽阔的道路，满怀信心向前迈进！（附图片）
