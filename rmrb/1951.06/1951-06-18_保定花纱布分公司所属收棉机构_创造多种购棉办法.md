The Baoding Branch of the China Textile Corporation and its subordinate branches, during the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, created a variety of cotton purchasing methods, resulting in a significant increase in the company's cotton procurement volume. The cotton purchasing team stationed in Yaocheng Village by the Textile Company, upon seeing that the masses liked "fabric remnants," came up with the idea of exchanging "fabric remnants" for cotton. Women around Yaocheng Village came one after another carrying cotton to exchange for "fabric remnants," increasing the amount of cotton available on the market from 400 jin to more than 1,200 jin; the company's procurement volume also increased. The cotton purchasing team stationed in Dabai Village by the Gaoyang Branch signed advance purchase contracts with five or six old cotton merchants in Dabai Village. The company first provided them with funds, and they would deliver a certain quantity, quality, and price of cotton to the company upon the contract's expiration. This not only reduced speculation by small merchants in the market but also helped to complete the state's cotton purchasing task. The Ding County Branch extracted more than 40 cadres and divided them into 15 mobile cotton purchasing teams to go to the countryside. In conjunction with local Party committees, governments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League departments, they mobilized Party members, League members, association members, and cadres to take the lead in selling cotton to the state. The personnel of the mobile cotton purchasing teams also used the farmers' meal and rest times to mobilize the farmers to sell cotton, simultaneously promoting and purchasing cotton. In this way, the cotton purchased through mobile procurement in various villages accounted for 53.47 percent of the total procurement, which was more than that purchased on the market. Farmers in Gaoyang, Boye, and Lixian often used cotton to exchange for bricks at brick kilns when building houses and digging wells; some brick kilns in these areas stored a portion of cotton. The Gaoyang Branch established relationships with these brick kilns, and the company supplied coal to the brick kilns through the coal industry construction company. When the brick kilns had cotton, they sold it to the company. The Xinliuzuo brick kiln in Gaoyang sold more than 1,800 jin of cotton to the company on two occasions.

　　保定花纱布分公司所属收棉机构        
    创造多种购棉办法
    中国花纱布公司保定分公司和所属支公司，在抗美援朝爱国运动中，创造了多种多样的收购棉花办法，使公司棉花收购量有显著增加。花纱布公司驻尧城村收花组，见到群众喜欢“布头”，就想出了用“布头”换棉花的办法。尧城村周围妇女纷纷背着棉花来换“布头”，棉花上市量由四百斤增到一千二百多斤；公司的收购量也增多了。高阳支公司驻大百尺村收花小组，和大百尺村的五、六个老收花贩订立了期购合同，公司先给他们款，到期交公司一定数量、质量和一定价钱的棉花。这样不光减少了小贩在市场上的投机活动，还有利于国家收棉任务的完成。定县支公司抽出了四十多个干部分成十五个流动收花组下乡，结合当地党委、政府、工会、青年团各部门干部，动员党员、团员、会员和干部带头向国家卖棉花。流动收花组的人员还利用农民吃饭和歇着的时候，动员农民卖棉花，随时宣传随时收购。这样到各村流动收购来的棉花，占总收购量的百分之五十三点四七，比在市场上收的还多。高阳、博野、蠡县的农民盖房打井，常用棉花到砖窑换砖；这些地区有的砖窑存着一部分棉花。高阳支公司就和这些砖窑建立了关系，公司通过煤业建筑公司供应砖窑煤炭，砖窑有棉花时就卖给公司。高阳辛留佐砖窑两次就卖给公司一千八百多斤棉花。
