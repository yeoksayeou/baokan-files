Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd: The four Foreign Ministers' assistants continued their meeting on the 20th. As everyone knows, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France sent a note to the Soviet government on the 15th, again refusing to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of American military bases on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and stated that there was no need for the four Foreign Ministers' assistants to continue their meetings.

At the meeting on the 20th, the Soviet representative Gromyko handed the Soviet government's reply to the three countries' note to the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France. In its note, the Soviet government reiterated the statement in the Soviet note of June 4: Once the Paris Foreign Ministers' assistants' meeting definitively resolves the issue of including the North Atlantic Treaty and American military bases on the agenda, the Soviet government is willing to immediately send representatives to the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Washington.

The note pointed out: On the one hand, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France refused to adopt the Soviet representative's proposal to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of American military bases on the agenda; on the other hand, the Soviet representative fully agreed to all the issues proposed by the three countries' representatives for discussion by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and all were included on the agenda without exception. Therefore, the three countries have placed the Soviet Union in a position of unequal rights. It is absolutely clear that the Soviet government cannot tolerate the position of unequal rights that the three countries' representatives are attempting to arrange for the Soviet Union.

The note declared that the Soviet government believes that it is necessary for the Foreign Ministers' assistants to continue their meetings in Paris in order to reach an agreement on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the basis of equality of rights for all parties concerned, so as to include the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of American military bases (as an unresolved issue) on the agenda, because this issue is extremely important for eliminating tension in Europe.

### 苏联政府复文美英法  重申北大西洋公约与美国军事基地问题应列入外长会议议程

　　苏联政府复文美英法
    重申北大西洋公约与美国军事基地问题应列入外长会议议程
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息：四国外长助理继续于二十日举行会议。大家知道，美、英、法三国政府曾于十五日照会苏联政府，再度拒绝将北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题列入外长会议议程，并表示四国外长助理已经没有继续举行会议的必要。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在二十日会议上将苏联政府对三国这项照会的复文交给美、英、法三国代表。苏联政府照会中重申苏联在六月四日照会中的声明：一俟巴黎外长助理会议肯定地解决了关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地一项议案列入议程的问题以后，苏联政府愿意立即派遣代表出席在华盛顿举行的外长会议。
    照会指出：一方面，美、英、法三国代表拒绝通过苏联代表所提出的把北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题列入议程的建议；另一方面，该三国代表提议由外长会议讨论的一切问题都得到了苏联代表的完全同意，都毫无例外地列入了议程。因此，该三国把苏联放在权利不平等的地位了。绝对明显，苏联政府不能容忍该三国代表所企图给苏联安排的权利不平等的地位。
    照会宣称，苏联政府认为，各外长助理有必要继续进行他们在巴黎的会议，以求在有关各方权利平等的基础上，就外长会议议程获致协议，务使北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题（作为未获协议的议案）列入议程，因为这个问题对于消除欧洲的紧张局势极为重要。
