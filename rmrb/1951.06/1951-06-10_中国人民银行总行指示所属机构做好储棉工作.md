The Head Office of the People's Bank of China
Instructs Affiliated Institutions to Do a Good Job in Cotton Storage

Following the issuance of the directive by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchase and storage, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, in order to cooperate with the trade and cooperative departments in carrying out this important task, specifically telegraphed its affiliated East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest Regional Branches, as well as the Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Tianjin, and Beijing branches in North China, instructing the affiliated branches and sub-branches in cotton-producing areas to immediately coordinate with relevant departments and actively prepare to proceed. At the same time, it consulted with the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to unify methods and issued joint instructions. The main points are: (1) When cotton farmers handle storage, they should be given a guarantee of principal and value based on the cotton price, allowing for increases but not decreases, and giving appropriate interest, in order to implement the policy of guaranteeing the interests of cotton farmers. (2) The storage period and types should be chosen voluntarily by the depositors. Procedures should be as simple as possible. (3) The materials needed by cotton farmers must be fully supplied. In particular, cotton farmers whose storage period has expired should be given priority purchasing rights. The instructions require all localities to widely carry out patriotic cotton storage propaganda based on these preferential conditions, and mobilize the broad masses of cotton farmers to enthusiastically respond to the call for cotton storage. The bank is now actively preparing to collect information on the implementation situation in various places, exchange work experience at any time, and study and improve work.

　　中国人民银行总行
    指示所属机构做好储棉工作
    中央人民政府政务院发布关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，中国人民银行总行为配合贸易、合作部门，做好这一重要工作，特分电所属华东、中南、西南、西北各区行及华北的河北、平原、山西、天津、北京等分行，指示所属产棉地区分、支行处，立即结合有关部门，积极准备进行。同时与中央人民政府贸易部及全国合作总社会商统一办法，发出联合指示。要点为：（一）棉农办理储存时，应按棉花牌价保本保值，听涨不听落，给以适当利息，以贯彻保证棉农利益的政策。（二）储存期限及种类，由存户自愿选择。手续力求简便。（三）棉农需要的物资，必需充分供应。尤其对储棉到期的棉农，更应给以优先购买权。指示要求各地根据这些优惠条件，普遍展开爱国主义的储棉宣传，动员广大棉农热烈响应储棉号召。该行现正积极准备搜集各地执行情况，随时交流工作经验并研究改进工作。
