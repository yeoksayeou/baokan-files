According to the China Youth Daily: Since the beginning of this semester, improving student health issues has received widespread attention from all parties. Schools in various regions have adopted many methods to bring about initial improvements in the poor health conditions of students caused by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

The methods generally adopted by schools in various regions are as follows: First, streamlining the curriculum, improving teaching quality, and reducing the burden on students. In the past, teachers of various subjects at Shijiazhuang No. 1 Middle School assigned homework without a plan, causing students to be unevenly busy. After students' suggestions, teachers of various subjects reallocated homework. Shenyang Railway Middle School is trying out a new timetable to give students adequate rest and recreation time. Previously, some students at the Jilin Institute of Technology Senior Vocational School's Mechanical Engineering Department attended 174 meetings in three weeks. Now, the school has established various meeting systems to reduce many unnecessary meetings.

Second, carrying out mass sports and recreational activities. Beijing No. 4 Middle School, the Women's Affiliated Middle School of the Normal University, and other schools are implementing the Soviet "Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system based on the specific conditions of the school, enabling each student to receive basic training in various sports according to their physical condition. Nanjing University put forward the slogan of "mass participation and diversification of sports and recreational activities" and launched singing, dancing, and other activities in the school. Linfen No. 2 Middle School in Shanxi Province pays attention to incorporating patriotic education into sports activities, enabling students to have some basic knowledge of military sports. Students at Shanghai Tongji Middle School recognize the significance of good health for building and defending the motherland, so everyone participates in morning exercises.

Third, improving food management and strengthening the education of kitchen staff. The administration and student union of Shenyang Institute of Technology Senior Vocational School jointly formed a food committee, carefully budgeting, paying attention to nutrition, and developing menus. Many schools have strengthened the education of kitchen staff, enabling them to automatically improve their operating methods and reduce waste. The kitchen staff of Shanxi No. 2 Industrial Technical School installed bellows next to the stove, saving 100 kilograms of coal per day and improving the food.

Fourth, paying attention to environmental hygiene and improving medical equipment. Schools in Beijing have generally carried out major cleanups and conducted physical examinations for students. Shaoyang No. 6 Middle School in Hunan Province hired a specialist to establish a health clinic. Shanghai Jiaotong University established a preparatory committee for tuberculosis prevention last year. After a semester of efforts, the weight of students with active tuberculosis has generally increased by five to twenty pounds.

After these efforts, the health of young students in various schools has generally improved. For example, at the end of the last semester, the number of sick students at Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School accounted for 5% of the total number of students every day, but by April of this year, it had decreased to 2%. After Baoding No. 2 Middle School improved its food according to nutritional standards, the number of students suffering from night blindness has decreased from more than 40 to 8, and the number of students suffering from gastrointestinal diseases has also been greatly reduced. According to statistics from Tie嶺 Normal School in Northeast China from the beginning of school to April, the average weight gain of new students was more than three and a half kilograms.

However, many schools misinterpret the meaning of "health first." For example, a few students at Jin 鐵 Middle School in Northeast China one-sidedly emphasize "health first" and ignore regular studies. Some students at Shenyang Institute of Technology Senior Vocational School believe that "health first" means "physical fitness first," and it doesn't matter if their grades are failing. Some schools have launched a large number of labor activities in order to improve health, even causing female students to engage in activities that their physical strength cannot bear. In addition, some schools still do not pay enough attention to student health issues. For example, students in the second grade of senior high school at Beijing Shandong Middle School have a 20% incidence of lung disease, but the school has not yet implemented isolation. These deviations urgently need to be corrected.

### 全国学生健康状况已有初步改进

　　全国学生健康状况已有初步改进
    据中国青年报载：本学期开学以来，改进学生健康问题已得到各方普遍的重视。各地学校采取了很多办法，使帝国主义和国民党反动派所造成的学生健康的不良状况，已得到初步的改进。
    各地学校大致采用了以下办法：一、精简课程，提高教学质量，减轻学生负担。石家庄市第一中学过去各科教员留给学生的作业缺乏计划，使学生忙闲不均。经学生建议后，各科教员重新调配了各科作业。沈阳铁路中学试行新作息时间表，使学生有充分休息和娱乐时间。吉林工科高级职业学校机械科，以前有的学生三周开了一百七十四次会，现在该校已订出各种会议制度，减少了许多不必要的会议。
    二、开展群众性的体育、文娱活动。北京市第四中学、师范大学女附中等校根据学校具体情况，试行苏联的“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度，使每个学生都能按自己的身体条件获得各种体育的基本锻炼。南京大学提出了“体育文娱活动群众化、多样化”的口号，在校中展开了歌咏、舞蹈等活动。山西临汾第二中学注意在体育活动中贯穿爱国主义教育，使学生能具有一些军事体育常识。上海同济中学学生认识到身体健康和建设祖国、保卫祖国的意义，因此大家都参加了早操。
    三、改善伙食管理，加强对厨工的教育。沈阳工科高级职业学校行政与学生会共同组成伙食委员会，精打细算，注意营养，订出了菜饭谱。很多学校加强对厨工的教育，使他们能自动地改进操作方法，减少浪费。山西第二工业技术学校的厨工在炉旁装设风箱，每天省炭一百斤，改善了伙食。
    四、注意环境卫生和改善医疗设备。北京市各校普遍进行了大扫除，并对学生身体施行检查。湖南邵阳第六中学聘请专人成立卫生医疗室。上海交通大学于去年成立了防痨委员会筹备会，经过一学期的努力，已使患活动性肺病的学生的体重普遍增加了五磅到二十磅。
    经过这些努力后，各校青年学生的健康状况一般地有了改进。如哈尔滨工农速成中学上期末每天病号占全体学生数的百分之五，到今年四月已减少到百分之二。保定市第二中学根据营养标准改善伙食后，学生患夜盲症的已由四十余人减到八人，患肠胃病的也大大减少。东北铁岭师范学校由开学到四月的统计，新生体重平均增加三斤半多。
    但也有不少的学校曲解“健康第一”的意义。如东北锦铁中学少数学生片面强调“健康第一”，忽视正课学习。沈阳工科高级职业学校有些学生认为“健康第一”就是“体格第一”，功课不及格也没关系。有些学校为了要搞好健康就大量展开劳动，甚至使女学生从事她们体力所不能负担的活动。此外，也有学校到现在对学生健康问题还没有足够的重视。如北京山东中学高中二年级的学生患肺病的占五分之一，但学校仍没有实行隔离。这些偏向急需纠正。
