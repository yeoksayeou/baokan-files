Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th: Soviet children live the happiest lives in the world. Children receive care from the state from the moment they are born. From the promulgation of the decree on the protection of motherhood and children in 1944 to 1950, the Soviet government allocated 18 billion rubles to subsidize mothers for childbirth expenses and allowances for large and single mothers, equivalent to the annual budget of the Ukrainian Republic. This year, the state's subsidies for large and single mothers amounted to 4.1 billion rubles.

Soviet permanent nurseries and kindergartens accommodate more than 3 million children, and collective farms' seasonal nurseries accommodate more than 4 million children in the spring and summer seasons. This year, the number of places in kindergartens will increase by 45,000 compared to last year, and nurseries will increase by 30,000. In addition, the state also subsidizes thousands of orphanages, nurturing and educating hundreds of thousands of children who lost their parents during the Great Patriotic War.

In addition to the children's institutions established by the state, the Soviet government also stipulates that all industrial enterprises with more than 500 employees must establish nurseries and kindergartens. Taking the "Red Rose" textile factory in Moscow as an example: the factory's nursery accommodates 150 children under the age of three. The nursery employs approximately 60 doctors, nurses, teachers, nannies, and cooks. In addition, it also runs a nursery for over 100 infants and a kindergarten for children aged three to seven. Last year, the nursery and kindergarten expenses amounted to 3 million rubles. The factory also established a summer camp on the banks of the Moscow Canal, with annual expenses of 300,000 rubles, where more than 800 children of employees spend their summer vacation. The summer camp life consists of games, travel, gardening, and collecting plant specimens.

In the Soviet Union, the expenses of preschool children's institutions are mostly borne by the state, with families only paying 10% to 15%. Children of martyrs' families, disabled soldiers' families, and parents with many children receive free education in children's institutions. In addition, the Soviet Union has also widely established children's auxiliary education institutions, including more than 1,000 Young Pioneer Palaces and Young Pioneer Buildings, 400 Young Technicians' Stations, 230 Young Natural Scientists' Stations, 140 children's theaters and puppet theaters, and many children's libraries and clubs.

Soviet children universally receive seven-year or ten-year education. For example, in the Kyrgyz Republic, with a population of less than 1.5 million, 330,000 children are educated in 1,650 primary and secondary schools. The Soviet government has also established hundreds of music, dance, and art schools, specializing in cultivating children with artistic talents.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to children's health. The government has widely established pregnancy consultation centers and maternity hospitals. There are currently 10,000 maternal and child health consultation centers and milk factories across the country. Every year before summer, doctors examine the physical condition of children in nurseries, kindergartens, and schools, and send them to scenic areas for recuperation according to their health conditions. Children can get the best food during recuperation. Children with weak health receive special care. Every year, 5 million primary and secondary school students go to summer camps, and 6 million young travelers travel throughout the country. Children who return from summer recuperation or travel gain weight, perform better in their studies, and get sick less often in winter. The government has specifically established schools to train pediatricians and nurses. Specialized scientific research institutes have been established in Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, and Rostov, and other regions to study methods of eliminating infant mortality and diseases, as well as caring for and educating children. Now, smallpox, diphtheria, and scarlet fever have been nearly eliminated in the Soviet Union, and other infectious diseases of children have also been greatly reduced, and the infant mortality rate has been decreasing year by year.

　　在苏联政府大力的关怀和教育下
    苏联儿童过着最幸福的生活
    【新华社莫斯科三十日电】苏联儿童过着世界上最幸福的生活。儿童一出生便受到国家的关怀。从一九四四年公布保护母性和儿童的法令到一九五○年，苏联政府补助母亲的生产费和多子及单身母亲的津贴拨款达一百八十亿卢布，等于乌克兰共和国一年的预算。今年国家给多子和单身母亲的津贴达四十一亿卢布。
    苏联常设的托儿所和幼稚园容纳三百多万儿童，集体农场的季节托儿所在春夏两季容纳四百多万儿童。今年幼稚园的容纳名额要比去年增加四万五千人，托儿所要增加三万人。此外，国家还津贴数千个孤儿之家，抚养和教育着数十万在卫国战争时失掉父母的儿童。
    除了国家设立的儿童机关以外，苏联政府还规定：凡五百人以上的工业企业都必须设立托儿所和幼稚园。以莫斯科“红玫瑰”纺织厂为例：这个厂的托儿所收养三岁以下的儿童一百五十人。在托儿所服务的医生、护士、教师、保姆和厨师约六十人。此外还办了一个收容一百多个婴儿的托儿所，和收容三岁到七岁的儿童的幼稚园。去年托儿所和幼稚园的经费达三百万卢布。工厂还在莫斯科运河岸上设立了夏令营，每年经费达三十万卢布，有职工的儿童八百多人在那里过暑假。儿童夏令营的生活是游戏、旅行、学园艺和收集植物标本。
    在苏联，学龄前的儿童机关的经费大半由国家负担，家庭只付百分之十到十五。烈士家属、残废军人家属和多子父母的子女，在儿童机关受免费教育。此外，苏联还广泛设立了儿童的辅助教育机关，包括一千多所少年先锋宫和少年先锋大厦、四百所幼年技术人员站、二百三十所幼年自然科学家站、一百四十所儿童剧院和傀儡剧院、以及许多儿童图书馆和俱乐部。
    苏联儿童普遍受到七年制或十年制的教育。例如，人口不到一百五十万的吉尔吉斯共和国，在一千六百五十所中小学校里，受教育的儿童就有三十三万人。苏联政府还设立了几百所音乐、舞蹈和美术学校，专门培养有艺术才能的儿童。
    苏联对儿童健康非常重视，政府广泛设立了孕妇顾问处和产科医院，全国现有妇婴医药顾问处和奶厂达一万所。每年夏季前医生都要检查托儿所、幼稚园和学校儿童们的体格，按健康情况分别送到各风景幽美的地区休养，儿童在休养期间可以得到最好的食物。体弱的儿童都受到特别照顾。每年有五百万中小学生到夏令营去，有六百万少年旅行家到全国各地游历。夏天休养或旅行归来的儿童，体重增加了，学习更有成绩，冬天也少害病。政府专门设立了培养小儿科医生和护士的学校。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔和罗斯多夫及其他地区都设有专门的科学研究所，研究消除儿童的夭折和疾病、以及看护和教育儿童的方法。现在苏联，天花、白喉、猩红热已近消灭，其他儿童传染病也大大减少，儿童夭折率已逐年降低。
