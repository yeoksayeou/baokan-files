　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 27th: Our reporter reports: The commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army on the Korean front are spending the anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War full of confidence in victory.
　　At dawn on June 25th, the heroes and meritorious individuals of the People's Army had already pinned their treasured and brilliant medals on their chests. In the morning light, they wrote letters to General Kim Il Sung, reporting on their combat deeds. Soldiers gathered in groups of three and five in the trenches, recounting their combat stories. Liu Jihong, a "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" who shot down five enemy planes in fifteen days during the Han River front blocking battle, said, "Our struggle this year has been arduous; but the victory has also been great. Our heroic struggle has made the US aggressors realize that the Korean people can never be conquered!"
　　These brave warriors, who have undergone severe tests of war, are full of confidence in the future of the war. At various discussion meetings, they unanimously agreed: We have the leadership of General Kim Il Sung; we have the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side; and we also have the active support of peace-loving people all over the world. The final victory must be ours. On that day, the brave men universally made new plans to perform meritorious deeds, determined to create greater victories together with the Chinese People's Volunteers in future battles, and completely defeat the invading army headed by the United States and the Syngman Rhee traitorous army.
　　On the evening of the 25th, various units of the People's Army held joyful evening parties on the front line. They sang and danced to their heart's content, and the entire front line was filled with majestic songs and music.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 28th: The Korean Workers' Party organ, "Rodong Sinmun," published an editorial on the first anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War on June 25th, entitled "The American Imperialism on the Road to Destruction," stating: Over the past year, the situation of the Korean War has become completely opposite to the situation that the American imperialists had imagined. Although the American imperialists stole the banner of the United Nations and mobilized the forces of nearly twenty countries, vainly attempting to conquer Korea with a quick victory; however, in the face of the heroic resistance of the Korean people, it has fallen into bankruptcy.
　　The editorial pointed out that the enemy's disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield and the anger of the people all over the world have not taught it any lessons; instead, it has wantonly trampled on international conventions, organized military and political aggression groups, and openly rearmed West Germany and Japan, taking the road of expanding armaments.
　　The editorial pointed out that if the American imperialists disregard the fact that the people of the world are unanimously opposed to its aggression against Korea, and if it is unwilling to learn lessons from the history of the demise of Hitler and Tojo and continue its aggressive actions, it can only accelerate its own fate of destruction.
　　The editorial concluded by saying: The bloody struggle of the people of Korea and China is a just struggle to stop the aggression of American imperialism, strive for Korean independence and freedom, and safeguard world peace and security. The final victory belongs to the people who are fighting for justice.

　　抗美战争一周年纪念日
    朝鲜人民军满怀信心决心打败美国侵略者
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社记者报道：朝鲜前线的朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员们，满怀胜利信心，度过朝鲜人民解放战争的一周年纪念日。
    六月二十五日黎明，人民军的英雄与功臣们，已经把平日珍藏着的灿烂的勋章佩挂在胸前。他们在晨曦中写信给金日成将军，报告自己的作战事迹。战士们三五成群地在战壕里倾谈自己的战斗故事。一位曾经在汉江前线阻击战十五天内击落五架敌机的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”柳基弘说：“这一年来我们的斗争是艰苦的；但胜利也是很大的。我们的英勇斗争使美国侵略者认识到朝鲜人民是永远征服不了的！”
    这些经过了战争的严重考验的英勇战士们，对战争前途充满了必胜的信心。在各处座谈会上，他们一致认为：我们有金日成将军的领导；有英勇的中国人民志愿军并肩作战；还有全世界爱好和平人民的积极支援，最后胜利一定是我们的。勇士们在当天普遍地订出了新的立功计划，决心在今后的战斗中和中国人民志愿军一起，创造更大的胜利，彻底打败以美国为首的侵略军和李承晚卖国军。
    二十五日晚，人民军各部在前线举行了愉快的晚会，他们尽情地歌唱和舞蹈，整个战线洋溢着雄壮的歌声和乐声。
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》在二十五日朝鲜人民解放战争一周年纪念日，以“走着败亡道路的美帝国主义”为题，发表社论说：一年来，朝鲜战争的形势，已变得和美帝国主义者所幻想的形势，完全相反。美帝国主义者虽然盗用联合国的招牌，动员了近二十个国家的兵力，妄图以速战速决的方法来征服朝鲜；但是，它在英勇抗战的朝鲜人民面前，陷入了破产的境地。
    社论指出：敌人在朝鲜战场上的惨败和全世界人民的愤怒，并未使它取得任何教训；它反而横暴地蹂躏国际公约，组织军事政治侵略集团，公开地重新武装西德和日本，走着扩张军备的道路。
    社论指出：如果美帝国主义者无视全世界人民一致反对它侵略朝鲜的事实，如果它不愿从希特勒、东条灭亡的历史中取得教训而继续它的侵略行动的话，那就只能加速它的自己败亡的命运。
    社论最后说：朝、中两国人民的流血斗争，是为了制止美帝国主义的侵略、争取朝鲜独立自由、保卫世界和平安全的正义斗争。最后胜利是属于为正义而斗争的人民的。
