At the Runheji Sluice Gate construction site in the Huai River midstream flood diversion area, nearly 100 technicians are working selflessly day and night for the people's water conservancy construction with a new working style and attitude. They come from cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Qingdao. More than 50 percent of them are students from universities such as Jiaotong, Tongji, Datong, St. John's, Guanghua, Fudan, Daxia, Zhejiang, and Zhijiang, as well as Nanjing Huai River Water Conservancy Vocational School and Shandong Industrial Vocational School.

The Runheji Sluice Gate is a massive project. To strengthen leadership over the construction of this project, the Huai River Harnessing Committee established the Runheji Dam Engineering Headquarters (hereinafter referred to as the Headquarters). Because this project is related to the lives and property of millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, and the completion time (before the flood season this summer) is very urgent, the design, surveying, and testing of this project are carried out simultaneously with construction. In terms of technology, many old technical methods have been changed. For example, in the past, the gate foundation of the sluice gate had to use foundation piles and sheet piles. Now, foundation piles are not used, and clay paving is used instead of sheet piles. This is a method that Chinese water conservancy experts have never used before. However, with the specific help of Soviet experts, general engineering personnel are adopting a humble and cautious attitude, and working hard to learn new engineering theories and technologies.

In the two months since the start of the sluice gate project, thanks to the enthusiastic work of these engineering personnel, they have finally overcome the difficulties of poor technical skills, insufficient manpower (only eleven chief and deputy engineers), and lack of engineering instruments and experience. They have fully demonstrated the spirit of hard struggle and connecting with the masses and reality in their work. For example, the personnel of the Design Section of the Engineering Department of the Headquarters, led by Section Chief Shen Yanji, have been working enthusiastically, constantly going to the construction site for on-site exploration, and working with construction personnel to study and improve methods, completely changing the old design method of "working behind closed doors." They work until midnight every day. Experienced engineers personally take the lead and kindly guide young engineering personnel in their work. Wu Yi and Chen Ziding, the chief and deputy directors of the Engineering Department of the Headquarters, as well as engineers Li Yuhua, Li Shi, Ma Liangji, and Wang Qingguan, work in shifts day and night, regardless of fatigue and weather, working in the factory all day long. Engineer Li Yuhua once coughed up blood due to overwork, but he still insisted on working. Director Wu Yi, with his graying hair, has been ill several times, but he still works hard with the same vigor as the young people.

Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the engineering personnel are playing an active leading role in their work. Huang Gong'an and He Desheng, Communist Youth League members from Tongji University, often stand in knee-deep muddy water to guide the migrant workers in carrying soil when repairing the fixed river channel, and voluntarily request to work the night shift. Gu Chengshi, a student from Datong University, worked continuously for 30 hours without rest when rushing to complete the clay paving project of the gate foundation. Wu Dunjun and Zhu Xiaolin, Communist Youth League members from Jiaotong University, stayed at the test site all day, patiently lying on the ground and carefully observing when testing the load-bearing capacity of the soil near the sluice gate. When the concrete pouring of the sluice gate project began, Wu Dunjun voluntarily bent down to level and tamp the bottom of the gate in order to master the engineering standards, often getting covered in cement, but never complained. Communist Party members Xu Zengyan and Huang Yuanming, and Communist Youth League members Cen Shulong and Lü Yishu directly lead the technical worker squads. They continuously and carefully learn the technical details of the construction and work together with the workers. Liu Xianggong, a Communist Youth League member from Jiaotong University, serves as the captain of the steel bar binding squad. Because the squad lacked layout masters, he personally did the layout work, took the initiative to save materials for the public, and united the workers to organize the scattered steel bars, which was supported by all the workers.

　　淮河中游蓄洪区分水闸工地近百技术人员为人民水利事业忘我工作
    在淮河中游蓄洪区的润河集分水闸工地上，近百个技术人员正以新的工作作风和态度，日日夜夜为人民的水利建设事业忘我地工作着。他们来自上海、南京、青岛等城市，其中百分之五十以上是交通、同济、大同、圣约翰、光华、复旦、大夏、浙江、之江等大学和南京淮河水利专科学校与山东工业专科学校等校的学生。
    润河集分水闸是一个规模巨大的工程，为了加强对这一工程建设的领导，治淮委员会特成立了润河集闸坝工程指挥部（以下简称指挥部）。因为这一工程关系到淮河中下游千百万人民的生命财产，完工的时间（今夏汛期以前）又非常急迫，所以这项工程的设计、测量和试验等工作都和施工同时进行。在技术方面，很多是改变了旧的技术方法的。如分水闸的闸基以往必须用基桩和板桩，现在则不打基桩，并且以铺粘土代替板桩，这是我国的水利专家们过去从未采用过的办法。但在苏联专家的具体帮助下，一般工程人员都抱着虚心谨慎的态度，努力学习新的工程理论和技术。
    分水闸工程开始两个月来，由于这些工程人员的热情工作，他们终于克服了技术差、力量不足（正副工程师仅十一人），以及工程仪器和工程经验都很缺乏的困难，在工作中充分发挥了艰苦奋斗和联系群众、联系实际的精神。如指挥部工务处设计科人员在科长沈衍基带头下，一直热情地工作着，不断地到工地上去实地勘察，并与施工人员共同研究改进办法，完全改变了过去“闭门造车”的设计方法，他们每天都工作到深夜十二时。有经验的工程师们亲自带头，亲切地指导青年工程人员进行工作。指挥部工务处的吴溢、陈志定正副处长及工程师李郁华、李石、马良骥、王庆官等都日夜轮班工作，不顾疲劳，不避风雨，整天在工场上工作。李郁华工程师曾因疲劳过度而咯血，但他仍坚持工作。须发斑白的吴溢处长，曾经累病了几次，还与青年人一样精神饱满地苦干下去。
    工程人员中的共产党员和青年团员在工作中起着积极的带头作用。同济大学青年团员黄恭安与何德生同学在修固定河槽时，经常站在水深及膝的污泥里指导民工挑土，并自动要求当夜班。大同大学顾澄世同学在突击完成闸基的铺粘土工程时，连续工作了三十小时不休息。交通大学青年团员吴敦组和朱小林同学等在试验分水闸附近土壤的荷重力时，整天不离试验场所，耐心地伏在地上仔细观察。在分水闸工程开始浇灌混凝土时，吴敦组同学为了掌握工程标准，自动弯腰在闸底做耙平捣实的工作，经常弄得满身都是水泥，从来不叫一声苦。共产党员徐曾衍、黄远明，青年团员岑书龙、吕益恕等同学直接担任技术工人中队的领导，他们不断细心地学习施工中的各项技术细节，与工人共同工作。交通大学青年团员刘显功担任扎铁中队长，由于该队的放样师傅不够，他就亲自做放样工作，并主动为公家节省器材，团结工人将零乱的钢筋整理起来，受到全体工人的拥护。（新华社）
