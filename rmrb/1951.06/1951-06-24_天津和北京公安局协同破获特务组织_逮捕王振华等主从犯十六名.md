　　Tianjin and Beijing Public Security Bureaus Cooperatively Crack Espionage Organization
    Arresting Sixteen Principal and Accessory Criminals Including Wang Zhenhua
    [This Newspaper’s Report] The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, in cooperation with the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, cracked a Kuomintang bandit secret service agency "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics" (保密局) covert espionage organization in Beijing and Tianjin in April of this year. They captured sixteen principal and accessory criminals including Wang Zhenhua, Yu Yongqing, Wang Lin, and Feng Runwu. They seized fourteen radio parts and vacuum tubes being secretly transported, as well as various pieces of incriminating evidence such as radio call signs, wavelengths, transmission schedules, and telegraph codebooks.
    The chief culprit, Wang Zhenhua, alias Wang Jiemin, colluded with Kuomintang secret service agents Ying Qianli and Ye Delu in North China during the Japanese puppet regime; after the Japanese surrender, he formally joined the Kuomintang "Military Statistics Bureau" (军统) secret service organization in Peiping and engaged in espionage activities against the Communist Party and the people. After the liberation of Beijing, not only did Wang fail to confess his crimes and surrender to the People's Government, but in the spring of 1949, he twice sneaked to Qingdao (which had not yet been liberated at that time) to contact Wang Puchen, the secret service chief of the Kuomintang bandit "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, North China Office," accepted the task of infiltrating Beijing assigned by Wang, and was appointed as "Beijing Group, Major Group Leader." He carried a radio, call signs, codes, and funds back to Beijing. In the Beijing and Tianjin area, Wang, along with criminals Hu Shanhe, Yu Yongqing, Liu Yongtian, and others who participated in infiltration and sabotage activities, actively prepared to set up a radio station, attempting to communicate with the remaining bandit gangs in Taiwan. Liu Wentian, a traitorous element lurking within our military organs as a clerk, was responsible for drawing diagrams and installation work. In October of last year and January of this year, Wang twice smuggled radio parts and fourteen vacuum tubes to Tianjin hidden inside vegetable baskets.
    Under the powerful force of our people's public security organs and the surveillance of the people, it was difficult for Wang and other secret agents to carry out their clandestine activities. However, Wang and others were not resigned to their fate. They secretly conspired with Wang Lin and other Kuomintang "Central Statistics Bureau" (中统) secret agents lurking in Beijing, planning to organize a "Common Assistance Mutual Aid Committee" to gather counter-revolutionary remnants; at the same time, they also plotted to organize an "Armed Guerrilla Training Class" to engage in armed rebellion. Up to the time the case was cracked, the criminals had successively stolen many pieces of intelligence.
    In addition to the chief villain Wang Zhenhua, the principal culprits in this case include: Liu Wentian, Wang Lin, Feng Runwu, Yu Yongqing, Dong Jingyun, and Hu Shanhe.
    There are also nine others, including Wang Suzhen and Lei Wenbing, who were either accessories or failed to report the crimes they knew about, and have all been arrested and brought to justice. All the bandits involved in the case will soon be transferred by the public security organs to the Military Law Department of the Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission for appropriate punishment in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries.

　　天津和北京公安局协同破获特务组织
    逮捕王振华等主从犯十六名
    【本报讯】天津市公安局与北京市公安局协同于今年四月间破获蒋匪特务机关“保密局”在北京、天津的潜伏特务组织，捕获王振华、于永清、王琳、冯润武等主从犯十六名，缴获正在密运的电台零件和真空管十四支以及电台呼号、波长、发报时间表、电报密码本等罪证多种。
    首犯王振华，化名王介民，在日伪时期即与国民党在华北的特务分子英千里、叶德禄相勾结；日寇投降后，即正式在北平参加国民党“军统”特务组织，从事反共反人民的特务活动。北京解放后，王犯不但不向人民政府坦白自首，反于一九四九年春两次潜赴青岛（当时青岛尚未解放）与蒋匪“保密局华北办事处”特务头子王蒲臣取得联系，接受王匪所交给的潜伏北京的任务，并被委为“北京组少校组长”，携带电台、呼号、密码及经费返京。王匪在北京、天津一带与参加潜伏破坏活动的胡山河、于永清、刘永田等犯积极筹备架设电台，企图与台湾残余匪帮通报，并由潜伏于我军事机关内任机务员的奸细分子刘文田担任绘图和装置工作。去年十月及今年一月，王匪曾两次将电台零件及真空管十四支装在菜篓内偷运至天津。
    在我人民公安机关的强大威力和人民群众的监视下，王匪等特务暗害活动难于开展。但是王匪等并不死心，又与国民党“中统”潜伏北京特务王琳等秘密商议，拟组织“共济互助委员会”，网罗反革命残余分子；同时，还阴谋组织“武装游击人员训练班”，从事武装暴动。截至破案时止，该犯等已先后偷取各种情报多件。
    本案首恶分子除王匪振华外，计有：刘文田、王琳、冯润武、于永清、董景云、胡山河。
    其他尚有王素珍、雷文炳等九人，他们或为从犯，或为知情不报，均已逮捕归案。全案匪犯即将由公安机关转送天津市军管会军法处，依照惩治反革命条例分别予以应得的惩处。
