　　Rapid Development of Cooperatives in Western Liaoning
    Over 500,000 New Members in the First Quarter, 90% of Farmers in Lishu County Join
    In Northeast China's Liaoxi Province, cooperatives have been implementing the policy of wholeheartedly serving their members, closely integrating with spring plowing preparations, promoting the sale of members' surplus grain and sideline products, and supplying members with production and living materials, leading to rapid business development for cooperatives across the province. The organization of cooperatives has also expanded accordingly. According to statistics at the end of March, the province already had 1,553,655 members, with over 500,000 new members joining in the first quarter alone, accounting for approximately one-half of the total number of members in the province last year. Cooperatives in various localities have concentrated their efforts on serving their members, satisfying them, and prompting many farmers to actively seek membership. In Lishu County, the province's 101 grassroots cooperatives added over 4,000 shares in the first quarter, with the number of farmers joining the cooperatives reaching about 90% of the total population. Cooperatives at all levels have implemented a division of labor between higher and lower-level cooperatives, expanded material exchanges within the province, and basically met the requirements of members for ordering and selling goods. In the first quarter alone, the provincial cooperative sold over 27 billion yuan worth of grain and sideline products, and according to incomplete statistics, county and city cooperatives supplied members with over 470 million yuan worth of production and living materials.
    However, due to unclear guidelines and policies or a lack of integration with actual business, some cooperatives in the province have simply emphasized consolidating cooperatives, hindering the development of business. For example, after the director of the Dachengtai Village Cooperative in Beizhen County returned from a meeting held by the county cooperative, he bluntly announced that they would not do business with non-members without going through a meeting of the board of directors or supervisors, or publicizing it to the members. At the same time, they did not actively improve supply and marketing operations, resulting in even members not buying things from the cooperative. In other cities and counties, some cooperatives have not been run well, and many members have withdrawn their shares and joined cooperatives in other villages, creating an imbalance in the development of cooperatives.

　　辽西合作社发展迅速
    第一季度吸收五十多万社员  梨树县农民百分之九十加入
    东北区辽西省合作社贯彻全力为社员服务的方针，密切结合春季备耕工作，推销社员余粮、副业产品、供应社员生产、生活资料，使全省合作社业务迅速发展。合作社的组织也随之扩大起来。根据三月底的统计，全省已有一百五十五万三千六百五十五名社员，其中在第一季度内吸收的社员就有五十多万人，约占去年全省社员总数的二分之一。各地合作社集中力量为社员服务，使社员感到满意，许多农民积极要求入社。该省梨树县一百零一个基层社，在第一季度里就增加了四千多股，全县入社的农民已达人口总额的百分之九十左右。各级合作社实行上下级社分工、扩大省内物资交流、基本上满足了社员订货和销货的要求。第一季度仅省社外销的粮食、副业产品就值人民币二百七十多亿元，由各县、市合作社供给社员的生产、生活资料，据不完全的统计就有四亿七千余万元。
    但是该省若干合作社由于方针政策不明确，或是没有结合实际业务，单纯地强调整社，因而阻碍了业务的开展。如该省北镇县大城台村合作社主任由县社开会回村后，不经过理、监事会议，也不向社员群众宣传，就生硬地宣布不做非社员生意，同时也不积极搞好供销业务，结果连社员都不到合作社买东西了。其他市、县也有些合作社因办的不好，很多社员抽股加入外村合作社，造成合作社发展不平衡的现象。
