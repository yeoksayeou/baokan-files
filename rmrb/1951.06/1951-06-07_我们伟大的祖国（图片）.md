    Our Great Motherland
    The largest People's Swimming Pool in Beijing has opened yesterday. This swimming pool was reconstructed from the dilapidated and polluted Qianhai Lake in Shichahai. The total area of the pool is 33,500 square meters, and the water area is 4,295 square meters. The pool is divided into a shallow pool, a competition pool, a deep pool, and a children's pool, which can accommodate 4,000 people in total. This is the children's pool, with a fountain of cement mushrooms. Look, the children are taking advantage of the first day to "soak in the mushrooms" in their own swimming pool!

    全国最大的北京市人民游泳场，已经在昨天开幕了。这个游泳场是由过去残破污浊的什刹海前海改建成功的。全场面积有三万三千五百平方公尺，池水面积为四千二百九十五平方公尺。全场分浅水池，比赛池，深水池，儿童池，四池共可容纳四千人。这里的就是儿童池，池子里有一个由水泥造成的蘑菇丛的喷泉。看，儿童们趁第一天就到自己的游泳池里“泡蘑菇”来啦！
