    (1) Liu Dezhen is a young worker at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant. In May 1949, in order to better cultivate him, the Party sent him to the North China Workers' Cadre School. After studying, Liu Dezhen's ideological awareness improved; he submitted an application to the Party to join, and with the Party's approval, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    (2) In September, a generator in the factory was suddenly damaged, and the workers' morale was affected. The Party organization and administrative leaders of the power plant issued a call at a general meeting to encourage everyone to repair the damaged generator.
    (3) Liu Dezhen took on the task of "repairing the No. × machine as soon as possible," diligently taking the lead in the work. For four months, he insisted on working twelve hours a day, and often promoted to the workers, "The sooner the generator is repaired, the sooner the entire city of Beijing will be restored to light." He encouraged everyone to overcome difficulties.
