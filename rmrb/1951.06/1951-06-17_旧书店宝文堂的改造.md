The Transformation of Baowentang Old Bookstore
　　Miao Peishi

　　On the south side of Damochang East Entrance in Beijing, there is an old bookstore called Baowentang. This bookstore was established during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of over a hundred years. From woodblock to letterpress printing, the books it published can be roughly divided into three categories: first, various scripts and librettos, such as: Beijing opera, Bangzi opera, Ping opera, drum lyrics, folk tunes, Pai Tzu music, etc.; second, school reference books, such as large and small calligraphy copybooks, red imitation grids, model compositions, letters and correspondence, etc.; third, daily tools and books for farmers, such as "Ask No One for Help," "Jade Box Record," "Rural Applied Writing," "Abacus Textbook," "Shixian Calendar" (old almanac), etc.

　　These books published by Baowentang were very popular in the vast rural areas of North, Northwest, and Northeast China. According to surveys: thin scripts and librettos sold about six to seven hundred thousand copies each year; the thin ones were then compiled into thicker volumes by category, such as Beijing Opera Compendium, Ping Opera Compendium, or Song Lyrics Compendium, with each thick volume containing about thirty thin ones, selling about sixty to seventy thousand copies each year. Old almanacs and calendars sold about four to five hundred thousand copies each year. The sales of student application books such as copybooks, imitation grids, and letters were also around one hundred thousand copies each year. Looking at the content of these books, they were either feudal superstitions or very low-level descriptions of pornography.

　　After the liberation of Beijing, the managers of Baowentang, Mr. Liu Shanzheng and Mr. Liu Yucheng, felt about this world: "Everything is different from the old society, and the books we print are no longer popular. What should we do in the future?" Liu Yucheng pulled students who were doing propaganda work on the street and asked, "What should we print now that the Communist Party has come?" The students simply replied, "The publishing of the democratic government is very free." Therefore, they felt: "After liberation, there are no new works suitable for them to print, and the future of their business is only to close down."

　　On October 15, 1949, a group of literary and art workers in Beijing, under the leadership of the Literary and Art Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, established the Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association to carry out the popularization of literary and art movement. I and Comrade Wang Yaping, etc., often visited Mr. Liu Shanzheng and Liu Yucheng under the pretext of buying books, to get through their thoughts, encourage them to do new publishing work, and introduce them to participate in the Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association as members. After several months of discussion and research, these two gentlemen accepted our suggestion to entrust us to compile some new mass literature and art works and hand them over to Baowentang for printing on a trial basis.

　　First of all, we used the version form of Baowentang's old opera books and old song books to edit popular versions of new folk art and new dramas. From the official publication in July last year to the end of the old lunar year, a total of more than forty kinds were printed, selling 920,000 copies. Now more than 120 kinds have been printed. This kind of popular version, because of its thin book, large font, and cheap price (each book only sells for one hundred yuan), and is also a form that the masses like to hear and see, so it has been widely welcomed by the masses as soon as it comes out. According to Baowentang's recent report, this kind of popular book has penetrated into rural temple fairs and book stalls in various parts of North China; as far as Qiqihar in the northeast and Ningxia and Gansu provinces in the northwest.

　　We also suggested that Baowentang compile some student application copybooks, model compositions, etc. The large and small calligraphy copybooks with new content such as praising Chairman Mao and The East is Red sold 100,000 copies last year.

　　Starting from March last year, we first sought Baowentang's consent to compile a new almanac, which was published jointly by Baowentang and various bookstores that had published almanacs in the past. After several meetings and discussions, everyone agreed to try to take care of the farmers' habits in form, delete the toxic parts of the old almanac in content, retain or modify those harmless contents, and add some policies and regulations, production knowledge, scientific common sense, family hygiene, and application text and entertainment materials. The "appropriate for what" annotated under the calendar in the second half of the year is what farmers check most often, so we changed this place, according to the old way, to "agricultural affairs to be done" in each season. This almanac sold about 650,000 copies.

　　In the past year, Baowentang has not only not closed down because its direction is right, but also has been greatly developed. In terms of personnel, there were only a dozen people in the previous year, and now it has increased to twenty-two people. In terms of business, the original extremely dilapidated small printing factory, after being reorganized, has now added two sets of old No. 5 and old No. 4 new lead characters, established a standardized binding room, and purchased a large foot-pedal machine, which has more than doubled the typesetting and printing power.

　　From the example of transforming Baowentang, to look at carrying out popular culture and art work, we feel that striving for old publishers to work together with emphasis is a shortcut. Because their social foundation is deep and their influence is very common, through their distribution network, we can quickly spread our new content of popular books to the vast rural areas. Bookstores of the Baowentang type exist in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xi'an, etc.

　　Second, literary and artistic forms that can be said and sung are the most familiar forms for the masses; because there are many illiterates in our country, it is very important to say it and sing it so that people can understand it.

　　Third, using some daily tool books that the broad masses are accustomed to carry out additions and transformations is the easiest to be accepted by the masses. For example, the new almanacs, large and small copybooks, picture literacy... etc., that we helped Baowentang adapt, have become best-selling items because they are welcomed by the masses.

　　With a little experience in transforming Baowentang, from December last year, under the initiative and guidance of the Beijing Municipal News and Publication Office, we united state-owned publishing enterprises such as the Workers' Publishing House and the New Beijing Publishing House, the Beijing Bookstore Industry Association, the Printing and Publishing Industry Association, and bookstores of the Baowentang type to jointly form the "New Mass Publishing House." After more than four months of organization and publicity, we have now raised enough equity of 200 million yuan, established a small-scale editorial department, specializing in editing and publishing comic strips, popular romances, and tool books for workers and peasants... etc., and it is expected to publish books this month.

　　旧书店宝文堂的改造
    苗培时
    在北京打磨厂东口路南，有一家旧书店叫宝文堂。这书店是清朝同治年间开业的，到现在有一百多年的历史了。它从木版到铅印，出版的书籍大概有三类：一是各种剧本唱本，如：京剧、梆子、评戏、鼓词、小调、牌子曲……等；二是学校参考用书，如：大小字帖、红模仿格、模范作文、书信尺牍……等；三是农民的日常工具用书，如《万事不求人》，《玉匣记》，《农村应用文》，《珠算课本》，时宪书（旧历书）……等。
    宝文堂出版的这些书籍，在华北、西北、东北的广大农村中非常畅销。据调查：薄的剧本唱本，每年要销售六七十万册；把薄的再按类合订起来，弄成什么京戏大观、评戏大观、曲词大观一类的厚本，每册厚的约包含三十本薄的，每年要销六、七万册。旧历书、日历等，每年要销四、五十万册。学生应用书的字帖、仿格、尺牍等，每年销数也都在十万左右。若从这些书的内容上看，不是封建迷信的，就是很低级的描写色情的。
    北京解放后，宝文堂的经理人刘善政先生和刘玉琤先生，对这个世面感到：“处处和旧社会不一样，自己印的这些书籍吃不开了，以后可该怎办？”刘玉琤拉着在大街上做宣传工作的学生们问：“共产党来了，我们该印些什么？”学生们仅仅回答他说：“民主政府的出版是非常自由的。”因此他们觉到：“解放了，没有新的适合他们印的作品，自己买卖的前途，只有关门的一条道。”
    一九四九年十月十五日，北京市的一部分文艺工作者们，在中共北京市委会文艺工作委员会领导下，成立了大众文艺创作研究会，来开展普及文艺运动。我和王亚平同志等，就常常到宝文堂借着买书的机会，访问了刘善政和刘玉琤先生，打通他们的思想，鼓励他们做新的出版工作，介绍他们参加了大众文艺创作研究会做会员。经过好几个月的讨论和研究，这两位先生，接受了我们的建议，委托我们编一些新的大众文艺作品，交宝文堂印一下试试看。
    首先，我们就利用宝文堂旧戏本、旧唱本的版本形式，编辑了新曲艺和新戏剧的普及本，从去年七月正式出版后，到旧历年底截止，共印出四十多种，销出九十二万册。到现在已经印出一百二十多种了。这种普及本，因为本子薄，字体大，价钱贱（每本只卖一百元），又是群众喜闻乐见的形式，所以一出来，就受到群众普遍的欢迎。据最近宝文堂的报告，这种普及本子，已经深入到华北各地农村庙会书摊上；远到东北的齐齐哈尔，西北的宁夏，甘肃等省了。
    我们又建议宝文堂编写了一些学生应用的大小字帖，模范作文等。写着歌颂毛主席、东方红等新内容的大小字帖，去年销售了十万册。
    由去年三月间开始，我们首先征求宝文堂的同意，编一本新历书，由宝文堂联合过去出版历书的各书店出版。经过几次开会座谈，大家都同意在形式上要尽量照顾农民的习惯，在内容上删掉旧历书的有毒部分，保留或修改那些无害的内容，增加一些政策法令、生产知识、科学常识、家庭卫生以及应用文字和文娱材料。后半部日历下边注解的“宜什么什么”，是农民们最经常查看的，我们就把这地方，按着老样子，改成每个季节的“农事应作”了。这历书销售约有六十五万多册。
    一年来，宝文堂因为自己的方向走对了，不但没有关门，而且得到了很大的发展。从人员上说，前一年只有十几个人，现在已增加到二十二人。从业务上说，原先一个极其破旧的小印刷厂，经过整理，现在已经补充了两付老五号、老四号新铅字，建立了正规化的装订房，添购了一架大脚蹬机，把排印力量提高了一倍以上。
    从改造宝文堂的例子中，来看开展通俗文化和文艺的工作，我们觉得、有重点地争取旧出版家共同来搞是一条近路。因为他们的社会基础较深，影响又很普遍，经过他们的发行网，很快地就可以把我们新内容的通俗书籍：传播到广大农村中去了。像宝文堂类型的书店，上海、天津、广州、西安……等大城市都有。
    二、能说能唱的文艺形式，是群众最熟悉的形式；因为我国的文盲多，说出来唱出来，能够让人听得懂，是非常重要的。
    三、利用一些广大群众习惯上的日用工具书来进行增添改造，是最容易为群众接受的。像我们帮助宝文堂改编的新历书、大小字帖、看图识字………等，因为得到群众的欢迎，都成了畅销的东西。
    我们有了改造宝文堂的一点经验，从去年十二月间，在北京市新闻出版处的倡议和辅导下面，联合了工人出版社、新北京出版社等公营出版企业，北京市书店业公会，印刷出版业公会，和宝文堂等类型的书店，合组了“新大众出版社”，经过四个多月的组织宣传，现在已经筹足了股金两亿元，成立了一个小规模的编辑部，专门编辑出版连环图画、通俗演义和工农应用的工具书……等，预计本月份就可以出书了。
