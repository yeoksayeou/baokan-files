Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), reported on the significance of the people's vote held in the GDR against German remilitarization and demanding a peace treaty with Germany be concluded in 1951. Mrs. Haulet-Mengert, a member of the Central Committee for the People's Vote in West Germany, and Mr. Hafermann, a member of the Central Committee for the People's Vote in West Berlin, reported on the preliminary statistics of the people's vote in West Germany and West Berlin. The meeting also heard a report from Wellmann, Secretary-General of the German Peace Committee, on the tasks of German peace advocates after the people's vote in the GDR, and adopted a declaration to the German people.
    Nuschke said in his report that the people's vote held in the GDR from June 3rd to 5th proved that if the German people could freely express their will, they would all support peace. The vast majority of the German people are against remilitarization and demand the conclusion of a peace treaty. He particularly pointed out that the results of this people's vote are a great encouragement to the people of West Germany, who will intensify their struggle against remilitarization.
    Mrs. Haulet-Mengert said that the people of West Germany have increasingly widely understood the necessity of opposing remilitarization. According to preliminary statistics, among those who participated in the people's vote, the percentage of those who opposed remilitarization and demanded a peace treaty with Germany be concluded in 1951 was 92.3% in Baden-Württemberg, 91.4% in Hamburg, and 89.8% in Bavaria.
    Professor Hafermann reported that as of June 7th, a total of 109,131 people in West Berlin had participated in the people's vote, of which 94,652 people, or 95.7%, opposed remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty.
    Wellmann reported that the holding of the people's vote was a great victory in the German peace movement. He reminded everyone, "Do not be complacent with our gains, but continue to consolidate and develop the achievements we have already made." Then, Wellmann put forward the tasks facing the local peace committees in strengthening the struggle for peace.
