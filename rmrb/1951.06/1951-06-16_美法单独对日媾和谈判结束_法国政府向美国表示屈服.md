Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Paris dispatch: The negotiations between the American warmonger Dulles and the French government regarding a separate peace treaty with Japan were held in Paris on the 11th and 12th. After the negotiations, the French Foreign Ministry spokesman announced on the 13th that the United States and France "have reached complete agreement on all matters of principle." This indicates that the French government has succumbed to the American plan for a separate peace treaty with Japan. One of the conditions for France's submission to the United States is that the United States allows the three French puppet regimes of Bảo Đại, Laos, and Cambodia to participate in the separate peace treaty with Japan.

Despite this, because both the United States and France have selfish motives on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, there are still differences of opinion between them on several issues. The French Foreign Ministry spokesman admitted that some of the "suggestions" put forward by France on "certain unimportant issues" still need to be "studied through diplomatic channels." According to Reuters, these issues that "remain to be resolved through diplomatic channels" include: France is concerned that Japanese goods supported by American capital will once again seize the French market, "and therefore opposes granting Japan complete trade freedom in the form of most-favored-nation treatment"; in addition, "France hopes to obtain 700 billion francs (approximately £700 million) from Japan as compensation for the damage caused by the Japanese army in Indochina during the war, to obtain the right for French citizens to claim compensation from Japan, and to obtain repayment of Japan's pre-war debts to France."

Dulles returned to London on the 13th to continue negotiations with the British government in order to completely suppress Britain's differences with the United States on the issue of a separate peace treaty with Japan.

　　美法单独对日媾和谈判结束        
    法国政府向美国表示屈服
    【新华社十五日讯】巴黎消息：美国战争贩子杜勒斯与法国政府关于单独对日媾和的谈判，于十一、十二两日在巴黎举行。谈判结束后，法国外交部发言人在十三日宣布：美法两国“在一切原则问题上已获致完全的协议”。这表明，法国政府是屈从美国单独对日和约的计划的。法国屈从美国的交换条件之一，是美国允许保大、老挝、柬埔寨三个法国傀儡政权参加单独对日和约。
    尽管如此，由于美法两国在对日和约问题上都抱有自私目的，因此它们在若干问题上仍存在着分歧的意见。法国外交部发言人承认：法国在“若干不重要的问题”上所提出的“建议”，有一部分还需要“通过外交途径加以研究”。据路透社透露，这些“尚待经由外交途径予以解决”的问题包括：法国顾虑美国资本支持下的日本商品将重新抢夺法国市场，“因而反对以最惠国待遇的形式给日本以完全的贸易自由”；此外，“法国希望获得日本关于战时日军在印度支那所进行的破坏的赔偿七千亿法郎（约合七亿英镑），获得法国公民向日本索取赔偿的权利，并获得日本战前对法国的负债的偿还。”
    杜勒斯已于十三日返抵伦敦，继续与英国政府谈判，以便完全压服英国在单独对日媾和问题上与美国的异议。
