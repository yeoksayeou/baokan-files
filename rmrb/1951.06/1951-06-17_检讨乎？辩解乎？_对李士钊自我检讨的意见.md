A Self-Criticism or a Defense?
    -- Opinions on Li Shizhao's Self-Criticism
　　Zhang Liyun
    When the People's Daily published Li Shizhao's self-criticism, "My Preliminary Understanding of the Error of Worshiping and Promoting Wu Xun," the editor stated in an editor's note: "We hope readers will write in with any opinions after reading this article." After reading it repeatedly, I feel that this piece is more of a defense than a "self-criticism." Is he willing to make up his mind to criticize himself? Has he thought about taking responsibility for the broad masses who have been poisoned by his propaganda? Is he willing to truly correct his thinking and stance through the discussion of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun"? From this self-criticism, it is highly doubtful.
    Li Shizhao is one of the active promoters of Wu Xun's thought, but when criticizing his own mistake of promoting Wu Xun, he seems to have very little connection with Wu Xun and Wu Xun's thought.
    What did Li Shizhao say in his self-criticism? He mainly talked about the following issues: First, he emphasized that his support and praise of Wu Xun was influenced by others, especially some "advanced, patriotic, and democratic people." Second, he emphasized that Mr. Tao Xingzhi's past praise of Wu Xun had a positive effect. Third, he repeatedly believed that all the blame for Wu Xun should be borne by the movie "The Life of Wu Xun." He emphasized that the Wu Xun in the movie is different from the historical Wu Xun, and that the historical Wu Xun was good. Fourth, he believes that the reason he made mistakes, in addition to being influenced by others, was mainly due to the errors of narrow sectarianism and narrow patriotic and hometown-loving thinking in education. That is to say, because Wu Xun was Chinese, and Li Shizhao is also Chinese; Wu Xun was from Shandong, and Li Shizhao is also from Shandong. In addition, "insufficient historical knowledge" is also an important reason for making mistakes.
    Isn't this using every possible means to defend himself? Where is there a hint of self-criticism?
    Li Shizhao puts the responsibility for his lifelong worship of Wu Xun and long-term promotion of Wu Xun's errors on others, which is obviously not in accordance with the facts. Li Shizhao was "very longing for" Wu Xun's behavior when he was ten years old; he began to study Wu Xun in 1933, and after 1934, he began to collect materials and documents about Wu Xun in preparation for promoting Wu Xun; at that time, he regarded Wu Xun as "a sage worthy of emulation and sincere respect." In 1943, he purchased "The Biography of Wu Xun" and "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun" and distributed them to teachers and friends. After that, he constantly promoted the "spirit of Wu Xun." In 1950, he personally wrote "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun" to promote Wu Xun's thought on a large scale and in a planned way. In this illustrated biography and the author's "My Opinion on the Movie "The Life of Wu Xun"," Wu Xun was praised to the utmost and eulogized as much as possible. It was said that Wu Xun was "a pioneer of the oppressed, humiliated, and harmed peasant class," "an ordinary but great working people," and his spirit was "willing to be an ox for the children of the poor working people, a selfless spirit of service," that Wu Xun was "the representative of the Chinese working people," and that Wu Xun "fought for the happiness of the poor children of his class for thirty years without slackening." He praised Wu Xun as "a great typical of the working people," who was willing to "be an ox for the people," and he "wholeheartedly served the people." Finally, Li Shizhao issued a call to the people of the whole country, saying: Wu Xun "is worthy of being learned by every citizen of the new China!" Judging from this series of facts, is Li Shizhao trying his best to influence others with Wu Xun's thought (that is, his own thought)? Or was he influenced by others?
    Regarding the initial criticisms from the Literary Gazette and the People's Daily, Li Shizhao "did not receive any fluctuations in his thinking" and believed that "it was just the opinion of literary critics who denied the movie." He once prepared to suggest that "the educational, historical, and literary circles widely discuss "The Life of Wu Xun"" to prove the correctness of his own opinions. At this time, Li Shizhao still refused the influence of others, and still attempted to influence others, isn't that the fact?
    Li Shizhao believes that he made an error of objectivism when writing "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun," which is also not the case. He is not a faithful objectivist. Zhang Zaixue criticized Li Shizhao in the article "Bad Thoughts Under the Cover of Good Terms" for "not only 'intentionally deleting some of Wu Xun's backward views,' but also intentionally supplementing some of Wu Xun's backward views; not only did he not 'correct all the incorrect statements,' but he also strengthened the incorrect statements and created the myth of Wu Xun's deeds." Can this be the attitude of an objectivist? When Li Shizhao promoted Wu Xun, he had a sense of love and hate, and he knew what he wanted to advocate and what he opposed, which is not objectivism. Is decorating Wu Xun colorfully and wanting "the people of New China to learn from him" also objectivism?
    It is impossible for Li Shizhao to move forward without examining his own thoughts and Wu Xun's thoughts together.
    As for the question of whether Mr. Tao Xingzhi's praise of the spirit of Wu Xun had a positive effect, I think the basic point of view in Comrade Yang Er's article is correct. "The spirit of Wu Xun" is wrong to praise today, and it was equally wrong in the past. Li Shizhao showed the contradiction in his own thinking on this issue. On the one hand, he affirmed that Mr. Tao's praise of Wu Xun was correct and had positive significance, which means that the "spirit of Wu Xun" should be praised; but on the other hand, Li Shizhao said: In the past, using Wu Xun's name to hold meetings and run schools to carry out democratic activities was only superficially "entrusted" in Wu Xun's name. This means that at that time, the name of Wu Xun was borrowed to carry out legitimate struggles, and he was not really being praised. I think both statements are wrong.
    If the purpose of "carrying out the democratic struggle for the people's main freedom" is clear, and using Wu Xun's name is only to provide cover, this is a question of the method of struggle, not a question of praising the "spirit of Wu Xun" and respecting Wu Xun. However, even so, it is not necessary to pretend to be Wu Xun to carry out democratic activities. Because at that time, there were many democratic activities in the Kuomintang-ruled areas: legal, illegal, open, and secret, and most of these activities did not "entrust" the name of Wu Xun. Li Shizhao said: "At that time, without entrusting "Commemorating Wu Xun," it would be impossible to hold a mass gathering of thousands of people under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule." In fact: workers and students have held countless mass rallies of thousands of people, and even demonstrations and parades, and it is not necessary to entrust "Commemorating Wu Xun."
    In fact, Li Shizhao and others praised the "spirit of Wu Xun" in the past not as a "pretence," but as sincere praise. The effect of this praise is bad. Li Shizhao said: At that time, the reactionary rulers also commended Wu Xun for supporting and supporting groups or schools named after Wu Xun. Why did the reactionary rulers do this? Obviously, Wu Xun's person and deeds were beneficial to them. Since this is the case, can it also be beneficial to the people at the same time? Impossible. So, what good is it to praise him for the people? Isn't this easier to confuse right and wrong, blur the people's struggle goals, and weaken the people's fighting spirit? During the Kuomintang rule, there were two opposing camps of domestic democratic forces and anti-democratic forces, but that was not a question of Wu Xun's name. On the contrary, careers and activities in the name of Wu Xun are more likely to confuse the two camps. On the contrary, it will blur the people's vision and hinder the people's awakening. Some progressive youths appeared in the schools run by Mr. Tao Xingzhi because Mr. Tao had anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideas and carried out democratic education, not because he promoted the "spirit of Wu Xun." In order to explain that Wu Xun is useful, forcibly linking Mr. Tao Xingzhi's progressiveness with the spirit of Wu Xun is the real "far-fetched."
    Promoting the "spirit of Wu Xun" is Mr. Tao Xingzhi's mistake, not his success. The reason why Mr. Tao admired Wu Xun like Liang Qichao showed the weakness in his thinking. We believe that if Mr. Tao were still alive, he would gladly correct his mistakes and would never use others as a shield to cover himself like Li Shizhao.
    Li Shizhao also tried his best to defend Wu Xun as a person. He said: "Wu Xun is fundamentally a person without political activities, and he has no factual connection with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement." But what did the author say in another article? "The insertion of characters such as Zhou Da from the Taiping Army in the play clearly pointed out the social background at that time." In this way, since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement is the social background of Wu Xun's founding of schools, he does have an internal "connection" with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement. In the course of the vigorous peasant uprising for decades, Wu Xun turned a deaf ear to the peasant struggle, took refuge in dignitaries, and devoted himself to building free schools, and prepared to use this free school as a way to solve social problems. It can be said that he was indeed carrying out a kind of political activity that weakened the peasant fighting spirit, blurred the peasant struggle goals, maintained the feudal system, and hindered social progress. The film only visualizes that internal relationship. In this way, it proves that it is not others who are wrong, but Li Shizhao himself. All accusations against the film are Li Shizhao's excuses. The nature and content of the two errors are the same.
    Wu Xun's slave-like appearance has been written and drawn clearly in the "Illustrated Biography" compiled by Li Shizhao himself, so there is no need to say more. He has a song for kneeling down to people: "Free school syndrome, no fire, see people, be respectful." Even this point, Li Shizhao has to defend Wu Xun. However, the materials are all there, what is there to defend!
    Li Shizhao does not dare to face his own ideological development and ideological essence squarely, does not dare to boldly expose and criticize the common points of his own thoughts and Wu Xun's thoughts, and does not dare to dig out his true ideological roots. When mentioning his consistent mistakes, he uses vulgar idealistic views to explain: saying that he admired him because he and Wu Xun were from the same hometown. Then, Shandong has produced countless national heroes, revolutionary martyrs, mass leaders... Why is Li Shizhao particularly interested in Wu Xun alone? Why did he yearn for Wu Xun's behavior when he was ten years old, and has become a believer in Wu Xun until today? Can this be explained by the three words "hometown people"? As for saying that because Wu Xun is Chinese and has a place in the history of education, it is also a strong argument. The reason is the same as above, so I won't say more.
    The author also uses "insufficient historical knowledge" as a shield everywhere. In fact, this is also the most clumsy weapon. Newspapers tell us that after watching the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" and listening to the legend of Wu Xun, many elementary school students, workers, and peasants feel that Wu Xun has no prospects, is not worth learning, and feels that he insulted the working people. Is this view a matter of how much historical knowledge one has, rather than a matter of class stand, mass viewpoint, and political consciousness?
    Li Shizhao said that his thoughts have been "preliminarily clarified and improved." To what extent has it been clarified and how much has it been improved? It is really difficult to figure out from the self-criticism. At the end of the self-criticism, he "earnestly hopes that all comrades who have watched the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" or read "The Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun" can enthusiastically participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" and seriously study all the documents on the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" and re-examine the erroneous influences they have received in the past." This hope is naturally good, but what is important is: it is hoped that Li Shizhao himself should first do this.

### 检讨乎？辩解乎？——对李士钊自我检讨的意见

　　检讨乎？辩解乎？
    ——对李士钊自我检讨的意见
　　张立云
    人民日报在发表李士钊的检讨《我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误》一文时，编者在按语中称：“希望读者看了这篇文章有什么意见尽量写来。”我反复看后，觉得这篇东西与其说是“检讨”，勿宁说是辩解。他是否愿意下决心检讨自己，是否想过要对受过他的宣传毒害的广大群众负责？是否愿意经过对武训和《武训传》的讨论真正把自己的思想、立场端正过来，从这篇检讨看来是大可怀疑的。
    李士钊是武训思想的积极宣传者之一，可是，当检讨自己宣扬武训的错误时，他就变得好像和武训、武训思想的关联很少了。
    李士钊在自己的检讨中讲了些什么呢？他主要讲了以下几个问题：第一、强调他自己所以拥护和表扬武训是受了别人，特别是一些“先进爱国的民主人士”的影响。第二、他强调陶行知先生过去对武训的表扬是有积极作用的。第三、他反复地认为：对武训的一切责备应由电影《武训传》负责。他强调电影上的武训和历史上的武训不同。历史上的武训是好的。第四、他认为自己所以犯错误，除了受别人的影响外，主要是犯了教育上狭隘的宗派主义和狭隘的爱国爱乡思想的错误。即是说因为武训是中国人，李士钊也是中国人；武训是山东人，李士钊也是山东人的缘故。除此之外，“历史知识太不够”也是犯错误的重要原因。
    这不是用尽一切办法为自己辩解吗？那里有一点检讨的味儿呢？
    李士钊把自己终生崇拜武训，长期宣扬武训的错误责任推到别人身上，这显然是不合事实的。李士钊十岁时就“非常向往”武训的为人；一九三三年就开始研究武训，一九三四年以后，即开始搜集关于武训的材料文献，准备为武训作宣传；当时并把武训“奉为足以师法和衷心崇敬的先哲”。一九四三年曾置买了《武训传》和《武训画传》分赠老师和朋友们。此后，即不断地宣扬“武训精神”。一九五○年亲手编写了《武训画传》，对武训思想大规模地、有计划地进行宣传。在这本画传和作者所写的《我看〈武训传〉电影》中，对武训作了无以复加的推崇和竭尽所能的歌颂。说武训是“被压迫被侮辱被残害的农民阶级的先觉者”，“一个平凡而伟大的劳动人民”，说他的精神是“俯首甘为孺子牛，为穷苦劳动人民的孩子们服务的忘我精神”，说武训是“中国的劳动人民的代表”，说武训“三十年毫无懈怠地为本阶级的苦孩子们的幸福而奋斗”。称颂武训是“一个劳动人民的伟大典型”，他甘心“作人民大众的牛”，他“全心全意为人民服务”。最后，李士钊并向全国人民发出号召说：武训“是值得每一个新中国的人民所应当学习的！”从这一连串的事实看，究竟是李士钊竭力想用武训思想（也就是他自己的思想）去影响别人呢？还是别人影响了他呢？
    对于文艺报和人民日报开初的批评，李士钊“在思想上没有受到任何波动”，并认为“不过是文艺批评家否定电影的意见。”他曾准备建议“教育界史学界文艺界广泛讨论武训传”来证明自己意见的正确。就在这时，李士钊仍然拒绝别人的影响，而仍然企图去影响别人，难道不是事实吗？
    李士钊认为自己在写《武训画传》时犯了客观主义的错误，这也不是事实。他并不是忠实的客观主义者，张再学在《好名词掩盖下的坏思想》一文批判李士钊“不但是‘有意的删除了武训的若干落后观点’，而且是有意的补充了武训的若干落后观点；不但没有‘纠正一切附会的不正确的说法’，而且还加强了附会的不正确的说法，创造了武训事迹的神话。”这能是客观主义者的态度吗？李士钊在宣传武训的时候，是有爱憎观念的，是懂得他自己要提倡什么，反对什么的，这不是什么客观主义。难道把武训装饰得花枝招展，要“新中国的人民都来学习他”也是客观主义吗？
    李士钊不把自己的思想和武训思想放在一起来检讨，就不可能前进一步。
    至于陶行知先生表扬武训精神有无积极作用这个问题，杨耳同志文章中的基本观点我认为是正确的。“武训精神”在今天表扬是错误，过去同样错误。李士钊在这个问题上表现了自己思想的矛盾。他一方面肯定陶先生表扬武训是对的，是有积极性的，这就是说应该表扬“武训精神”；可是，另一方面，李士钊又说：过去用武训的名字开会办学校，进行民主活动，只是表面上“借托”武训的名义。这就是说：当时是借武训之名进行合法斗争，并不是真正在表扬他。我认为：两种说法都是错误的。
    如果，“进行争民主要自由的民主斗争”目的是明确的，用武训之名只是为了打打掩护，这是斗争方式问题，不是表扬“武训精神”、崇敬武训的问题。但是，即使是这样，假托武训之名进行民主活动也并不是必要的。因为当时在国民党统治区有过许许多多的民主活动：合法的、非法的、公开的、秘密的，这些活动绝大部分并未“借托”武训之名。李士钊说：“那时候不借托‘纪念武训’，无法在蒋介石的反动统治下，开一个几千人的群众集会。”事实上：工人，学生举行过无数次几千人的群众大会，甚至示威游行，也并不是非借托“纪念武训”不可。
    事实上，李士钊等过去表扬“武训精神”，并不是什么“假托”，而是诚心诚意在表扬。这种表扬的作用是坏的。李士钊说：当时反动统治者也旌表武训扶植与支持以武训命名的团体或学校。反动统治者为什么要这样作呢？显然是武训其人其事对他们有利。既然如此，他还能同时也对人民有利吗？不可能。那么，表扬他对人民有何好处呢？这样不是更容易混淆黑白，模糊人民斗争目标，削弱人民斗志吗？在国民党统治时期，国内有民主力量和反民主力量两个对立的营垒，但那并不是什么以武训为名的问题。相反，以武训为名的事业与活动，反而容易把两个营垒混淆起来。反而会模糊人民视听，阻碍人民觉悟。陶行知先生办的学校里出现过一些进步青年，那是因为陶先生有反帝反封建的思想，进行了民主教育，并不是因为提倡了什么“武训精神”。为了说明武训有用，把陶行知先生的进步性，硬和武训精神拉在一起，才是真正的“牵强附会”。
    提倡“武训精神”是陶行知先生的错误，不是他的成功。陶先生之所以与梁启超一样地推崇武训表现了他的思想上的弱点。我们相信：陶先生如果还在，他一定会欣然纠正自己的错误，而决不会像李士钊这样的利用别人作盾牌来掩护自己。
    对于武训其人，李士钊也极尽其辩解之能事。他说：“武训根本是一个没有政治活动的人，他与太平天国运动在事实上毫无牵连。”但在另一篇文章里作者怎样说呢：“戏里穿插上周大等太平军人物，明确指出了当时的社会背景。”这样看来，太平天国运动既是武训兴学的社会背景，他和太平天国运动就确有内在的“牵连”。在数十年间如火如荼的农民起义过程中，武训对农民斗争不闻不问，投靠达官豪门，一心兴修义学，并准备把这种义学当作解决社会问题的办法，这就可以说他确实在进行着一种削弱农民斗志，模糊农民斗争目标、维护封建制度、阻碍社会前进的政治活动。电影不过把那种内在的关系形象化而已。这样说来反倒证明错了的不是别的，恰是李士钊自己。一切对于电影的指责，都是李士钊的推脱之辞。二者的错误性质和内容都是一样的。
    武训的奴才像，在李士钊自己编的《画传》里已写得画得明明白白，用不着多说。他见人下跪是有歌的：“义学症，没火性，见了人，把礼敬。”就连这一点，李士钊也要替武训辩解一番。可是，材料俱在，何辩之有！
    李士钊不敢正视自己的思想发展和思想本质，不敢大胆揭穿并批判自己思想和武训思想的共同之点，不敢挖掘自己真正的思想根源。在提到自己的一贯错误时，却用庸俗的唯心观点来解释：说因为和武训是同乡才崇拜他。那末，山东出过无数民族英雄，革命志士，群众领袖……为什么李士钊单单对武训这样感觉兴趣呢？为什么十岁时就向往武训的为人，直到今天竟成了武训的信徒呢？这难道是用“故乡人”三个字可以说通的吗？至于说因为武训是中国人，在教育史上有地位云云，同样是强辞夺理，理由同上，不多说了。
    作者还处处以“历史知识不够”作挡箭牌。其实，这也是最拙劣的武器。报纸告诉我们，看了《武训传》电影，听了武训的传说，许多小学生、工人、农民都觉得武训没出息，不值得学习，觉得他污辱了劳动人民。难道这种看法是历史知识多少的问题，而不是阶级立场、群众观点、政治觉悟的问题吗？
    李士钊说：自己的思想已“初步澄清和提高”，究竟澄清到若何程度，提高了多少？从检讨中实难令人捉摸。在检讨的结尾，他“剀切地盼望凡是看过电影《武训传》或读过《武训画传》的同志们，都能热烈地参加《武训传》的讨论，并认真地学习关于讨论《武训传》的一切文件，重新检讨过去所受的错误影响。”这个希望自然是好的，但是，重要的是：希望李士钊自己应当首先做到这一点。
