Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th—More than 2,600 families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in Changsha City have received preferential treatment and care from the People's Government, as well as the respect and love of the broad masses of people.  In the past year, the city's People's Government allocated more than 174,000 catties of rice and more than 800 pieces of clothing to help impoverished military families. More than 50 impoverished military families were allocated public housing by the government.  All children of 300 military families were admitted to schools free of charge. All public hospitals in the urban area provide preferential treatment for military families seeking medical care.

The Municipal People's Government also actively supports and organizes military families to engage in production or provides them with job referrals.  More than 500 military family members have been introduced to work in government agencies and state-owned enterprises.  The municipal government has organized three clothing processing factories, absorbing more than 350 military family members to participate in production.

With the strong support of the government, the lives of military families have greatly improved.  Zhao Zhigang, a military family member, relied entirely on mending clothes for others to make a living before liberation, and her income was insufficient to make ends meet.  After the liberation of Changsha, the People's Government gave her relief grain.  In November of last year, the People's Government introduced her to work in a clothing factory.  Her two sons were also approved to attend school free of charge.  Her current monthly salary is around 350,000 yuan, and in addition to maintaining her family's life, she also has monthly savings.

Military families are respected and loved by the people, and many military family members have been elected as residents' committee members.  Two military family members were elected as representatives to attend the first Hunan Provincial People's Representative Conference. Four military family members were elected as representatives to participate in the Changsha Municipal People's Representative Conference.  During this year's Spring Festival, more than 2,000 people from all walks of life in the city warmly congratulated military families on the Spring Festival.  The Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government and the Mayor of the Changsha Municipal People's Government personally extended their warm greetings to them.  Cao Kun, the younger brother of People's Hero Cao Kun in the Volunteer Army, has been introduced by the People's Government to work in a motor and dyeing factory.  Liu Qingzhong's son, Liu Zhenhua, recently performed meritorious service on the Korean battlefield. When the good news arrived, local residents beat gongs and drums to congratulate his family.

In order to thank the government and the people for their love, the families of revolutionary soldiers have written letters to encourage their children to work harder to defend the motherland and defend world peace. Military families are also participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with various practical actions. Liu Xiong, a military family member, runs a slaughtering business. He not only paid his taxes in advance, but also organized and promoted other industrialists and businessmen to pay taxes in advance, and was therefore commended by the Municipal Taxation Bureau. After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued a call for donations of airplanes and cannons, military families in the city responded enthusiastically. Some specially made Resist America, Aid Korea donation boxes, putting the money saved every day into the box, accumulating it, and preparing to donate it to buy airplanes and cannons.

　　长沙烈属及军属受到优待和尊敬
    【新华社长沙十八日电】长沙市二千六百余户革命烈士、革命军人的家属受到人民政府的优待和照顾，与广大人民的尊敬和热爱。该市人民政府去年一年中曾拨出大米一十七万四千多斤、衣服八百多件，救助了较贫苦的军属。五十多户贫苦军属由政府配给了公共房屋。三百个军属子弟全部免费入学。市区所有公立医院对军属治病都予以优待。
    市人民政府并积极扶助和组织军属进行生产或给他们介绍职业。五百多名军属已先后被介绍到政府机关和公营企业部门工作。市政府组织了三个被服加工厂，吸收了三百五十多名军属参加生产。
    军属们在得到政府的大力扶助后，生活都大为改善。军属赵志刚在解放前全靠替别人缝补衣服糊口，入不敷出。长沙解放后，人民政府发给了她救济粮。去年十一月人民政府又介绍她参加被服厂工作。她的两个儿子也都被批准免费上学。她现在每月工资收入在三十五万元左右，除维持一家生活外，每月还有积蓄。
    军属们受到人民的尊敬和热爱，很多军属被选为居民委员。有两位军属被选为代表出席了湖南省首届各界人民代表会议。有四位军属被选为代表参加了长沙市各界人民代表会议。今年春节，该市各界人民二千余人分别向全市军属热烈祝贺春节。湖南省人民政府主席、长沙市人民政府市长都亲自向他们殷切慰问。志愿军中的人民功臣曹坤的弟弟已由人民政府介绍入某电机染织厂工作。刘庆重的儿子刘振华新近在朝鲜战场上立了功，当喜报传来时，当地居民都敲着锣鼓到他家去祝贺。
    为了答谢政府和人民的热爱，革命军人家属都写信鼓舞自己的子弟，要他们更好地为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗。军属们并以各项实际行动参加抗美援朝运动。军属刘雄是经营屠宰业的。他不但自己提前纳税，而且组织与推动其他工商业者提前缴税，因而受到市税务局的表扬。中国人民抗美援朝总会发出关于捐献飞机大炮的号召后，该市军属即纷纷响应。有的特地做了抗美援朝捐献筒，将每天节省下来的钱放到筒里，储积起来，准备捐献买飞机、大炮。
