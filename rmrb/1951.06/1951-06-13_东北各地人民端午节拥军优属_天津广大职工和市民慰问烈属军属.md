Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: Around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, people in various parts of Northeast China enthusiastically launched activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs. On May 22nd, the Benxi Municipal People's Government convened a joint meeting of representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, and members of street committees in charge of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, reviewed the work of preferential treatment over the past year, and established the Municipal People's Committee for Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families, formulated a city-wide public agreement on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, and launched a campaign of soliciting donations and extending greetings. The Anshan Municipal People's Government sent 800 sets of summer clothing materials to families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen throughout the city. People from all walks of life in Heilongjiang Province voluntarily donated more than 115,000 catties of pork and 2,600,800 eggs to extend greetings to local troops, public security forces, disabled revolutionary veterans, demobilized soldiers, and families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen. The value of the consolation money donated by people from all walks of life in Qiqihar City reached more than 80 million yuan. The business community in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, donated 50 million yuan in cash to extend greetings to families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the People's Governments of various districts in Shenyang City conducted in-depth inspections of the work of giving preferential treatment to families and introduced a number of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen to employment opportunities. Each family of revolutionary martyrs and family of servicemen in Chengguan District, Nongan County, Jilin Province, received two catties of meat, two catties of flour, two catties of vermicelli, and fifteen eggs for the Dragon Boat Festival.
In addition, the districts of Shenyang City, the cities and counties of Songjiang Province, and the vast rural areas of Northeast China all held symposiums of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival to solicit their opinions on improving the work of preferential treatment. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, some cities also held army-civilian get-togethers, providing free admission for families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen to watch movies and participate in other recreational activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: Broad masses of workers and citizens in Tianjin extended greetings to families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival. In addition to sending gifts and greetings to families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen, the citizens of the city also held get-togethers with them. At the get-together held within the jurisdiction of the Dabeiyuan Police Station in the city, residents unanimously expressed that they would frequently extend greetings to families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen and help them solve difficulties in production and life in a timely manner. Wang Pingying, a representative of elementary school students, said, "We guarantee to help the younger brothers and sisters of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen do well in their studies." Yang Fulin, a representative of the business community, stated: "When families of revolutionary martyrs and families of servicemen have difficulties in life, we guarantee to help them solve them with the greatest strength." Representatives of military families also proposed at the meeting that they should not rely solely on government care but should solve their living problems through labor and production. The villagers of Ningjia Fangzi Village in the Eleventh District had done a good job in the work of giving preferential treatment in the past, and now they have formulated a specific plan: to ensure that the houses of families of martyrs and families of servicemen are repaired and do not leak a drop of water, to cultivate their paddy fields well, and to ensure that their firewood is supplied in a timely manner.
The North Station Trade Union of the Tianjin Railway Administration organized a team to extend greetings to the families of workers at the station who volunteered to go to Korea to support the war effort. Employees of the city's public bus company donated more than 600,000 yuan to buy zongzi (glutinous rice dumplings) and pastries to send to the homes of employees of the company who are participating in military cadre schools. The Fuhua Clothing and Leather Processing Factory in the city hired Chen Chunfeng and other family members of volunteers to join the factory's production.
