    (Sixteen) In August 1950, the Shijingshan Power Plant elected model workers. Comrade Liu Dezhen was elected as a labor hero and then, with the most votes among the nine units of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Municipal Engineering Union, was elected to attend the city-wide model worker representative conference. In the election of model worker representatives in Beijing, he was elected as the second representative to attend the National Industrial Model Worker Conference. He gloriously shook hands with Chairman Mao at the National Model Worker Conference!
    (Seventeen) Since being elected as a model worker, he has become even more cautious and humble. He said to the foreman Yang, Tong Huizeng, at the steam turbine plant: "I am young and need the guidance of the veteran masters in everything. My skills are far behind those of the masters!"
    (Eighteen) The No. 6 generator is running very well now. Who doesn't love light! Liu Dezhen and light are forever inseparable. (The End)

    （十六）一九五○年八月，石景山发电厂选举劳动模范。刘德珍同志被选为劳动英雄，接着又在北京市总工会市政工会的九个单位中以票数最多当选了出席全市的劳动模范代表，在全北京市的劳动模范代表选举中又以第二席当选出席全国的工业劳动模范代表。他在全国劳动模范大会上光荣的和毛主席握手了！
    （十七）他自从被选为劳动模范后，就更加谨慎谦虚。他对汽机场的杨老领班佟惠增说：“我年岁小，处处都得老师傅们指教，技术上比老师傅可差得远呢！”
    （十八）六号发电机，现在转动得很好，谁不喜欢光明呀！刘德珍和光明永远分不开。（完）
