Editor's Note: We published a selection of representative letters from readers on June 1st in this column, expressing dissent or doubt about the criticisms of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun." Today, we are publishing Mr. Xiao Zou's letter, which expresses disagreement with the articles by Comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji, also in this column. In addition to asking Comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji to respond to Mr. Xiao Zou, we also hope that readers will discuss Mr. Xiao Zou's letter and the letters in this column on June 1st.

I have seen the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" twice: the first time (in Shanghai) I thought it was very good; the second time (in Beijing) I still thought it was very good. The reason I think "The Life of Wu Xun" is good is because this film profoundly, thoroughly, and completely exposes the brutality and viciousness of the feudal system. Under such a system, some people, like Zhang the Licentiate, have absolute freedom to do whatever they please; while others, like Wu Xun, don't even dare to frown. After watching this film, I don't feel that any "Wu Xun spirit" occupies a very important or special place in this film. Of course, it has a place, but only a part. Mr. Sun Yu's "Directing and Writing the Biography of Wu Xun" can prove this point. Mr. Sun Yu said that this film can "expose the viciousness of the feudal rulers' policy of keeping the people ignorant"; can "depict the brutality of landlords and local bullies' reactionary forces"; can "praise the spirit of selfless service." Therefore, I have objections to both Comrade Yang Er's and Comrade Jia Ji's articles. Because Comrade Yang Er's article mainly talks about the "Wu Xun spirit." Comrade Jia Ji's article also only talks about the "meaning and value of Wu Xun's entire personality, thought, and behavior."

Comrade Yang Er said that Wu Xun's era was an era when the internal contradictions of feudal society had become very acute, and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement was a major eruption of this contradictory volcano. Under such specific historical conditions, Wu Xun's "begging for education" could not only not solve the fundamental problem of overthrowing the feudal mountain on the heads of the peasants, but also could not have any other role in promoting social development. Therefore, Wu Xun's path was wrong. Since this is the case, then one cannot isolate Wu Xun's lifelong suffering, enduring beatings and scolding, or his dedication to his career to the point of "selflessness," and think that his "extraordinary spirit" is great.

This is to say that from subjective wishes to life practice, Wu Xun was entirely wrong. Comrade Jia Ji's opinion is the same as Comrade Yang Er's. Comrade Jia Ji said that Wu Xun's understanding of life and the development of life (as well as the method of understanding) started from the individual, was subjectively idealistic, and formalistic. He did not know that the demands of the broad masses of peasants were to first solve the fundamental problems in life, not secondary cultural issues: literacy. He did not realize what words should be known, what to do with literacy, and for whom to do it. He thought that building a free school was a victory, but in reality, he handed it over to the landlords; he thought that students reading books was a victory, but in reality, they were being educated in the "Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues" against the interests of the people. This is said on the one hand about subjective wishes. Secondly, in terms of life practice, Comrade Jia Ji said that Wu Xun took the beggar route, the route of advanced degree holder officials, celebrities, and scholars, and took the route of class reconciliation, similar to reformist methods. Compromise and surrender were his results and his essence. In addition to this, Comrade Jia Ji also said that "social effect" should be used to test subjective wishes. Comrade Yang Er made a profound supplementary explanation to this: promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" under reactionary rule could not be less harmful than promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" after the people have seized power today. On the contrary, it could be said that it is potentially more harmful. Because promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" under reactionary rule would more directly "lower and corrode the masses' cultural and political fighting power"; while promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" today certainly has a certain degree of bad political influence. Because this would cause even those most die-hard and incorrigible counter-revolutionaries to be considered "admirable" figures in some sense.

This is to say that not only should we not use movies to promote the "Wu Xun spirit" today; even yesterday, when Mr. Tao Xingzhi promoted the "Wu Xun spirit," it was also wrong. Because this will produce a very bad "social effect." If the "social effect" is not good, no matter how good the subjective wishes are, they will not be good.

Based on the views of Comrade Yang Er and Comrade Jia Ji, I don't quite agree either.

We have said enough about the phrase "existence determines consciousness." Therefore, to criticize a person's "path" from subjective wishes to life practice, to criticize the "meaning and value of a person's entire personality, thought, and behavior," we must first clarify the "historical conditions" at that time. This is not a matter of "excusing oneself based on the limitations of historical conditions," nor is it a matter of "lowering the standard," but it is really a matter of discussing the matter on its own merits. We know that Wu Xun was a laboring peasant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He didn't even recognize a single character of Confucius, let alone Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, it was impossible for him to make a scientific analysis of the "era." He didn't know what a "fundamental problem" was or what a "secondary problem" was. He didn't understand the difference between "content" and "form," and he didn't even know what the "class reconciliation route" was all about. Because he suffered deception and insults from people like Zhang the Licentiate when he was a child, he thought of the suffering of not knowing how to read, and he had the subjective wish to run schools for poor children (this kind of thinking is the same as wanting to eat when hungry and wanting to wear clothes when cold). He didn't have the "ability" of Zhang the Licentiate to earn money by "one word" causing people to live and "one word" causing people to die. He was also very honest and would not swindle money with a black conscience like the local bully. Then how could he run schools for poor children? The only way was to sell his labor. But selling labor also depends on the occasion. It was not possible to sell labor in Zhang the Licentiate's house, because after working hard for three years, the eighteen strings of cash were still written off by Zhang the Licentiate. Since this is the case, then go to the streets to sell "skills," then go "beg." This kind of single-handedly Don Quixote-like action is very natural in a scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy society. On such a social and economic basis, how can we demand that Wu Xun take the "mass line"! Because the "mass line" is a product of collectivism and has its own certain social and economic basis! In addition, Wu Xun's era was an era of "advanced degree holder officials, celebrities, and scholars" and the "Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues" who were "self-centered". Without these two "treasures," schools would not be successful at all. This is determined by historical conditions. Under the brutal and vicious feudal system, Wu Xun's failure was an inevitable ending!

It is true that Wu Xun's era was an era when the internal contradictions of feudal society were very acute. But it is particularly important to note that the flood of peasant movements was already flowing to a low ebb at that time. And Wu Xun was also a fellow villager of Confucius and was particularly conservative. Therefore, it would certainly be better if he could have made a revolution like Hong Xiuquan. Otherwise, it doesn't matter if he honestly runs schools for poor children. Because this is always better than Zeng Guofan. Mr. Tao Xingzhi was anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. Today we say that he "promoted social development." But during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, some natural scientists and engineers who did not participate in political activities handed over all the knowledge and technology they had studied in the past to the people after liberation to serve the people and actively participated in the economic construction of New China. How can we say that their past actions "hindered social development"! Mr. Zhang Boling passed away, and memorial services were held in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Xinhua News Agency said: "...Zhang founded Nankai University in Tianjin, Nankai Middle School in Tianjin, and Nankai Middle School in Chongqing, and made some contributions to education. But in politics, he pinned his hopes on the reactionary ruling class, and in his later years, he even served as the president of the Examination Yuan of the Kuomintang reactionary government. ..." This statement demonstrates a noble political style, is convincing, and solves the problem. Mr. Zhang Boling ran Western bourgeois education, accepted Western cultural traditions, and spread Western bourgeois ideologies and lifestyles, and most of the thousands of talents cultivated under such educational influence served Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. But Xinhua News Agency still said that Mr. Zhang Boling "made some contributions to education," because these many talents can now serve the people well. Since this is the case, then what else can we say about Wu Xun!

Secondly, regarding the issue of "social effect," Comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji also imagined it too simply. We know that the "social effect" (mass action) influenced by ideology is mainly determined by the economic foundation of this society. If this ideology can adapt to the economic foundation of this society, then under the influence of this ideology, the broad masses of this society will express a strong action of "people with the same mind and the same reason." If this is not the case, then this ideology can only be a beautiful ideal, or it can only be a "decoration" in a historical museum. The popularity of "acupuncture" is because it meets the urgent needs of the broad masses of people at present. But it is not a panacea. Acute pneumonia must be treated with "penicillin." The "high-speed cutting method" at the performance meeting can increase mechanical efficiency by 30% to 40%. But on the basis of China's old-fashioned lathes, it can generally only be increased by 5% to 6%. After the Han Dynasty, because of the long-term devastation of the Three Kingdoms, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the population was sparse, and ownerless wasteland was everywhere. This created favorable conditions for the development of the large landlord economy. By the end of the Sui and the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, the development of the large landlord economy had reached its peak. In addition, because at the end of the Sui and the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, the heroes divided the territory and there had been wars for a long time, the people of the whole country longed for recuperation. Therefore, Li Shimin was able to establish a great Tang empire that "promoted social development." "Chastity arches" can only have a certain influence in extremely remote and closed places where transportation is extremely inconvenient and "men and women should not touch each other." "Bushido" is a product of Japanese society. Comrade Jia Ji is right: "Today, the environment and conditions have completely changed. That dark ruling era where one wanted to serve the people but could not is gone forever." And today's "environment and conditions" are: land reform has been implemented in the vast rural areas, and peasants have been freed economically and politically; factories and enterprises have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and workers have stood up. Comrade Jia Ji is right: "Today is a bright era, a great Mao Zedong era. The great Mao Zedong Thought has victoriously transformed and is transforming the face of our great motherland and the lives of the people, and it has also victoriously transformed and is transforming the thoughts of each of us. It is precisely the victory of Mao Zedong Thought that the working class and the peasant masses have the full environment and conditions to turn themselves culturally; and it is precisely because they first studied Mao Zedong Thought that intellectuals can truly serve the workers and peasants. ..." Since this is the case, then the "Wu Xun spirit" cannot have any influence in the Mao Zedong era. Is there still a problem with this? If someone uses "chastity arches" to seduce today's women, today's women will definitely say he is crazy. Similarly, what influence can the "Wu Xun spirit" have on the actual lives of the broad masses of people today, other than making the broad masses of people feel that it is a缥缈 ethereal and empty fantasy! Promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" is one thing, and whether the broad masses of people accept the "Wu Xun spirit" is another. Comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji did not strictly distinguish between the two, so they became confused in their ideology.

In summary, the "Wu Xun spirit" cannot be accepted by the broad masses of people today, let alone generate a mass movement. If individual counter-revolutionaries are influenced by the "Wu Xun spirit" and are "incorrigible until death," it can only be said that it is a very special exception. But the "movie" The Life of Wu Xun mainly uses Wu Xun's life to expose the brutality and viciousness of the feudal system. This is exactly the same as how "Corruption" uses the secret agent Zhao Huiming to expose the brutality and viciousness of the secret agent system. So the "movie" The Life of Wu Xun still has certain value.

专栏：

　　电影《武训传》还是有一定的价值
    和杨耳、贾霁两同志讨论
    编者按：读者对于武训和武训传的批评表示异议或怀疑的来信，我们已于六月一日选了一部分有代表性的在本栏发表。今天所发表的萧奏先生的来信，是对杨耳、贾霁两位同志的文章表示异议的，也在本栏发表。我们除请杨耳、贾霁两同志答复萧奏先生外，也希望读者同志们对萧奏先生的来信和六月一日本栏的来信加以讨论。
    武训传我看过两次：第一次（在上海）看过后觉得很好；第二次（在北京）还是觉得很好。我其所以认为《武训传》好，是因为这部影片深刻地、彻底地、全部地揭露了封建制度的残暴和毒辣。在这样的制度底下，有的人，比如张举人，有绝大的自由，爱高兴怎么干就怎么干；而有的人，比如武训，连眉毛都不敢皱一皱。看过这部影片之后，我倒不觉得什么“武训精神”在这部影片里面占据了十分重要、十分特殊的地位。当然、地位是有的，但只是一部分。孙瑜先生的《编导武训传记》就可以证明这一点。孙瑜先生说这部影片可以“揭露封建统治者愚民政策的毒辣”；可以“描述地主恶霸反动势力的残暴”；可以“歌颂忘我的服务精神”。所以，我对杨耳同志和贾霁同志的两篇文章都有意见。因为杨耳同志的文章主要是谈“武训精神”的。贾霁同志的文章也只谈了武训“全部人格、思想、行为的意义和价值。”
    杨耳同志说武训的时代是封建社会内在矛盾已经十分尖锐化的时代，太平天国运动是这个矛盾火山的大爆发。在这样一个具体的历史条件下，武训的“行乞兴学”不仅不能解决推倒农民头上的封建大山的根本问题，而且也不能有其他什么推进社会发展的作用，因此武训的道路是错误的。既然这样，那就不能孤立地从武训毕生受苦、忍打耐骂、或者对他的事业专心致志到“忘我”的境界，就认为他的“卓越精神”是伟大的。
    这是说从主观愿望到生活实践，武训是整个儿地错了。贾霁同志的意见和杨耳同志的意见相同。贾霁同志说武训对于生活和生活发展的认识（以及认识的方法）是从个人出发的，主观唯心的，形式主义的。他不知道广大农民的要求是首先解决生活中的根本问题，而不是文化上的次要问题：识字。他不曾意识到应该识什么字，识了字干什么和为谁干。他以为修成了义学是个胜利，而实际却交给地主掌握了；他以为学生念了书就是胜利，而实际上却在受“三纲五常”的反人民利益的教育。这是说主观愿望一方面。其次在生活实践一方面，贾霁同志说武训走的是叫化子路线、进士老爷名流学者路线，走的是阶级调和路线，近似于改良主义的方法，妥协与投降是他的结果，是他的实质。除此之外，贾霁同志还说要根据“社会效果”来检验主观愿望。对于这，杨耳同志作了一个深刻的补充说明：在反动统治下宣扬“武训精神”，比起今天人民取得了政权之后宣扬“武训精神”，它的为害决不可能更小些。相反，倒不如说是可能更大些。因为在反动统治下面宣扬“武训精神”，就会更直接地“降低和腐蚀群众的文化和政治上的战斗力”；而在今天宣扬“武训精神”当然也有一定程度的不好的政治影响。因为这样会使那些最死心塌地至死不悟的反革命分子，也要被认为在某种意义上“可钦佩”的人物了。
    这是说不但在今天用电影来宣扬“武训精神”是不应该的；就是昨天陶行知先生宣扬“武训精神”也是错误的。因为这样会产生一种很不好的“社会效果”。“社会效果”不好，主观愿望怎么样也不会好。
    就根据杨耳同志和贾霁同志的观点来分析，我也不大同意。
    “存在决定意识”这句话我们已经说够了。因此，要从主观愿望到生活实践来批判一个人的“道路”，要批判一个人的“全部人格、思想、行为的意义和价值”，就一定得要搞清楚他当时的“历史条件”才行，这并不是什么“借口历史条件所限”的问题，也不是什么“降低尺度”的问题，而实在是就事论事的问题。我们知道：武训是一介劳动农民，他没有机会上学。连孔夫子的字一个也认不得，更不要说马列主义了。因此，他不可能对“时代”作一个科学分析，他不知道什么叫做“根本问题”，什么叫做“次要问题”。他不懂得“内容”和“形式”的区别，他更不晓得“阶级调和路线”是怎么一回事。因为小时候遭受了张举人这些人的欺骗和侮辱，所以才想到了认不得字的苦处，才有为穷孩子们办学校的主观愿望（这样的想法和饿了要吃饭冷了要穿衣的想法是相同的）。他没有张举人那样的“本领”，可以“一字”叫人生、“一字”叫人死地赚元宝银子。他又很老实，不会像地保那样黑着良心骗钱。那他怎么能够为穷孩子们办学校呢？唯一的办法就是出卖劳动力。但出卖劳动力也要看什么场合，在张举人家里那样地出卖劳动力是不行的，因为那样白白干了三年，结果十八吊钱还是给张举人一笔勾消了。既然这样，那就去跑江湖卖“把式”吧，那就去“讨”吧。这种单枪匹马的唐·吉歌德式的举动，在一种分散的、落后的小农经济的社会里，是十分自然的。在这样的社会经济基础上，我们又怎么能够要求武训走“群众路线”呢！因为“群众路线”是集体主义的产物，是有它一定的社会经济基础的！另外，武训的时代是“进士老爷名流学者”和“三纲五常”“唯我独尊”的时代，没有这两样“宝贝”，学校就根本办不成功。这是历史条件所决定的。在残暴、毒辣的封建制度底下，武训的失败是必然的结局！
    不错，武训的时代是封建社会内在矛盾十分尖锐化的时代。但要特别注意的，就是农民运动的洪水在当时已经流向低潮。而武训又是孔夫子的老乡，又特别保守，所以，他如果能够像洪秀全那样闹革命当然更好，否则，老老实实地为穷孩子们办学校也没有关系。因为这样总比曾国藩要强些。陶行知先生反帝，反封建，我们今天说他“推进社会发展”。但在国民党反动派统治时代，有些没有参加政治活动的自然科学家和工程师，在解放以后把他们过去所研究的学问和所钻研的技术全部地交给人民，为人民服务，积极地参加新中国的经济建设，我们又怎么好说他们过去的所作所为是“阻碍社会发展”呢！张伯苓先生去世了，北京、天津、上海等地还开过追悼会。新华社说：“……张曾创办天津南开大学、天津南开中学、重庆南开中学，对教育事业有所贡献。但在政治上则寄希望于反动统治阶级，晚年竟任国民党反动政府考试院院长。……”这样的说法表现了一种崇高的政治风度，是使人心服的，是解决问题的。张伯苓先生办的是西洋资产阶级的教育，接受西洋文化传统散播西洋资产阶级的思想意识和生活方式，而在这样的教育影响下所培植出来的千千万万人材又大多数为蒋介石的反动统治服过务。但新华社还是说张伯苓先生“对教育事业有所贡献”，因为这许许多多的人材现在又能很好地为人民服务了。既然这样，那我们对武训还能说什么呢！
    其次关于“社会效果”这样的问题，杨耳同志和贾霁同志也想像得太简单了。我们知道，思想意识所影响成功的“社会效果”（群众行动），主要是这个社会的经济基础所决定的，如果这种思想意识能够适应这个社会的经济基础，那在这种思想意识的影响下，这个社会的广大群众才会“人同此心心同此理”地表现出来一种坚强的行动。如果不是这样，那这种思想意识只能是一种美丽的理想，或者只能是一种历史博物馆的“装饰品”。“针灸法”的流行是因为它满足了目前广大群众的迫切需要。但它也不是万能的。急性肺炎就一定得要打“盘尼西林”。表演会上的“高速度切削法”可以提高机械效率三、四十倍。但在中国旧式车床的基础上，一般只能提高五、六倍。从两汉以后，因为经过三国两晋南北朝长时期的摧残，人口稀少，无主荒地到处都是，这样给大地主经济的发展造成了有利的条件，到隋末唐初，大地主经济的发展已经达到了登峰造极的地步；另外因为在隋末唐初，群雄割据，久经战乱，全国人民渴望休养生息，所以李世民才能建立一个“推进社会发展”的大唐帝国。“贞节牌坊”只能在极端偏僻闭塞的、交通极端不方便的“男女授受不亲”的情况下发生一定的影响。“武士道”则是日本社会的产物。贾霁同志说得对：“今天，环境与条件完全变了。那种想为人民服务而不可得的黑暗统治时代已经一去不复返了。”而今天的“环境与条件”就是：广大的农村已经实行了土地改革，农民已经从经济上和政治上翻了身；工厂企业已经从帝国主义和官僚资本主义的枷锁中解放出来，工人已经站起来了。……贾霁同志说得对：“今天，是光明的时代，是伟大的毛泽东时代。伟大的毛泽东思想胜利地改造了和改造着我们伟大祖国和人民生活的面貌，同样胜利地改造了和改造着我们每一个人的思想。正是毛泽东思想的胜利，工农大众才具备了充分的环境与条件在文化上翻身；也正是因为首先学习了毛泽东思想，知识分子才可能真正地为工农群众服务。……”既然这样，那“武训精神”在毛泽东时代就不可能发生丝毫影响。这难道还有问题？如果有人把“贞节牌坊”来勾引今天的妇女，那今天的妇女一定会说他是疯子。同样，“武训精神”除了使广大群众感觉到是一种飘渺而空虚幻想以外，对于广大群众今天的实际生活还能发生什么影响呢！宣扬“武训精神”是一回事，广大群众接不接受“武训精神”是另外一回事，杨耳同志和贾霁同志没有把两者严格地区别开来，所以在思想意识上就给搞糊涂了。
    总括地说来，“武训精神”不可能为今天的广大群众所接受，更不可能产生一种群众性的运动。如果有个别的反革命分子受了“武训精神”的影响而“至死不悟”的话，那只能说是一个十分特殊的例外。但“电影”武训传主要是借武训的一生来揭露封建制度的残暴和毒辣的。这和《腐蚀》借特务赵惠明来揭露特务制度的残暴和毒辣的情况一模一样。所以“电影”武训传还是有一定的价值。
