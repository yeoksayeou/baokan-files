Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: The British Labour government, extremely alarmed and disturbed by the impartial report of Mrs. Felton, the British representative of the investigation team organized by the Women's International Democratic Federation regarding the atrocities of American troops in Korea about the atrocities of the American and British forces in Korea, has removed Mrs. Felton from her current position as Chairman of the Board of the British state-owned Stevenage Company, effective June 12th.

Progressive British public opinion has unanimously expressed indignation at the government's persecution of Mrs. Felton. According to a report by a reporter from the British *Daily Worker* cited by TASS, Labour Party member McAllister said: "Isn't such an action a blatant attack on civil liberties? Parliament and the whole country are extremely doubtful about this." The reporter said that McAllister's words expressed the feelings of many Labour MPs. Former Labour MP Braddock told the *Daily Worker* reporter, "I think it is regrettable if a person is fired for saying what he believes to be true without investigation by the authorities. This shows that our country has reached the point of being afraid to face unpleasant realities."

After being dismissed, Mrs. Felton told reporters: "The truth about Korea is so tragic that I cannot remain silent. I was dismissed because I discovered the truth. The government does not dare to let the people of the whole country know what barbaric things they are doing in the name of Western civilization. The simple fact is this: the entire Korean people and the life they have created for themselves are being destroyed by deliberately taken barbaric actions, which can only be compared to the barbaric actions of Hitler and the German Gestapo against the Jews. The United States is using heinous weapons against civilians. Every British soldier in Korea can prove my words."

　　英政府害怕揭露侵朝真相        
    竟免除费尔顿夫人的职务
    【新华社十五日讯】英国工党政府对于国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团英国代表费尔顿夫人关于侵朝美英军队暴行的公正报告，极为恐慌不安，自六月十二日起，已免除了费尔顿夫人现任英国营企业斯提芬内吉公司董事长的职位。
    英国进步公众对于政府迫害费尔顿夫人的行动，一致表示愤慨。据塔斯社引英国《工人日报》记者报道，工党党员麦柯利斯特说：“这样一个举动是不是对公民自由的露骨攻击呢，议会和全国对这都感到极端的怀疑。”记者说，麦柯利斯特这些话正说出了许多工党议员的感想。前工党议员布拉多克对工人日报记者说，“我觉得，如果一个人因为说了他自信为真实的事情，而当局不加调查，便加以开除，那是很可慨叹的。这表现我国已到了害怕面对不快的现实的地步。”
    费尔顿夫人在被免职后，向记者发表谈话说：“朝鲜的真相是如此的凄惨，我无法闭口无言。我被免职是因为我发现了真相。政府不敢让全国人民知道：它们正在借西方文明之名做出何等野蛮的事情。简单的事实是这样：朝鲜全体人民及他们为自己所创造的生活正被蓄意采取的野蛮行动所摧毁，这种行动只有希特勒和德国秘密警察对付犹太人的野蛮行动，可以与之比拟。美国正使用穷凶极恶的武器对付平民。每一个在朝鲜的英国士兵都能证明我的话。”
