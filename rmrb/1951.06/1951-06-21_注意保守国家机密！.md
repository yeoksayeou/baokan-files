　　Be Careful to Keep State Secrets!
  I. Be Careful Not to Expose State Secrets When Talking
    After reading the People's Daily editorial on June 11th, "Struggling to Keep State Secrets," my understanding of secrecy has been greatly enhanced. In the past, my understanding of secrecy was very narrow. I always felt that there were no secrets to keep in my work, and I thought it was enough to "not ask what should not be known, and not say what should not be said." I forgot the more important thing, which is to supervise each other, or to help others pay attention to keeping state secrets in a timely manner. I often meet comrades from some agencies and enterprises who discuss their work, study, or review something on trams or buses. However, it is very possible that when you are unintentionally talking about work, the enemy just happens to obtain the most valuable material. The serious losses suffered by a certain rubber factory in the movie "Invisible Front" were because the factory's employees talked about the upcoming celebration in the factory while waiting for the tram, and as a result, they were exploited by special agents. This is a good lesson. Therefore, I believe that the phenomenon of casually chatting about work on the road is very dangerous. In the future, we should pay attention to correcting this behavior of ignoring secrecy anytime and anywhere.

  II. Secrecy Clauses Can Be Included in the Patriotic Pact
    Comrade Editor:
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued and implemented the "Provisional Regulations on Keeping State Secrets" on June 8th. This is a major political task for the people of the whole country at present. As the People's Daily editorial said: "Strictly keeping state secrets is an important part of the struggle against the enemy and is one of the issues related to the greatest interests of the people of the whole country." Therefore, I suggest that people from all walks of life across the country stipulate clauses on keeping state secrets in the "Patriotic Pact," consciously develop the habit of keeping secrets, and resolutely fight against complacency.

### 注意保守国家机密！

　　注意保守国家机密！
  一、留心谈话时不要暴露国家秘密
    读了六月十一日人民日报《为保守国家机密而斗争》的社论以后，使我对于保密的认识更提高了一步。过去我对于保密认识是很狭隘的，总感觉自己的工作任务上并没有什么秘密可保，认为只要个人作到“不应知者不问，不应说者不说”就够了。忘记了更重要的却在于互相监督，或及时帮助别人注意保守国家机密。我常常遇见有些机关、企业的工作同志，在电车或公共汽车上畅论着工作学习或者检讨一件什么事情。但是，很可能当你无意的谈着工作的时候，敌人就正好获得了最宝贵的材料。电影《无形战线》中的某橡胶厂所受到的严重损失，就是因为该厂的职员在等电车时，谈起场内将开庆祝会的事，而结果就被特务钻了空子，这是一个很好的教训。所以我认为在道路上漫谈工作的现象，是很危险的。今后，我们应该随时随地注意纠正这种忽视保密的行为。

  二、爱国公约中可列入保密条款编辑同志：
    中央人民政府政务院在六月八日命令公布施行“保守国家机密暂行条例”。这是全国人民当前的一个重大政治任务。正如人民日报社论说：“严格地保守国家机密，是对敌斗争的重要环节，是关系全国人民最大利益的问题之一。”因此我建议全国各界人民在“爱国公约”中订立保守国家机密的条款，自觉地养成保密习惯，坚决同麻痹思想作斗争。
