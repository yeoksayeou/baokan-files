Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee
    Emergency Directive on Preventing and Controlling Locusts
    We are currently in the locust nymph outbreak season. According to reports from various regions, large numbers of locust nymphs have emerged in counties such as Xuyi, Sihong, and Funan in northern Anhui, Huanghua, Jinghai, Raoyang, Jingxian, Enxian, Hengshui, and Lulong in Hebei Province, as well as Xinhailian City, Peixian, Wudi, and Wuqiao in Shandong Province, and are beginning to harm crops. This is a major issue related to the production and livelihoods of the broad masses of people. All areas where locust nymphs have emerged, the local people's governments should immediately mobilize and organize the broad masses of farmers, according to local conditions, to urgently carry out capture and killing using methods such as digging ditches, surrounding and beating, burning with fire, netting, and insecticide spraying, resolutely implement the spirit of "attack early, attack small, attack thoroughly," and completely eliminate the locust plague in the nymph stage.
    According to investigations, the density of scattered locust nymphs increased in various regions in 1950. It is estimated that a large number of flying locusts may occur this year. Therefore, areas where locust nymphs have not yet occurred should immediately conduct in-depth inspections, especially paying extra attention to large areas of wasteland such as beaches, flood-prone saline-alkali wasteland, and marshland areas, to achieve "where locust nymphs occur, eliminate them there immediately."

　　政务院财政经济委员会
    关于防治蝗蝻工作的紧急指示
    目前正值蝗蝻发生季节，据各地报告，皖北的盱眙、泗洪、阜南等县，河北省黄骅、静海、饶阳、景县、恩县、衡水、卢龙等县，以及山东省新海连市，沛县、无棣、吴桥等县，均已发生大批蝗蝻，开始为害作物。这是关系广大人民生产生活的重大问题。凡已发生蝗蝻的地区，当地人民政府应立即发动和组织广大农民，按照当地环境，用掘沟、围打、火烧、网捕、药杀等办法紧急进行捕杀，坚决贯彻“打小、打少、打了”的精神，干净、彻底全部把蝗害消灭在幼虫阶段。
    据调查，一九五○年各地散居型蝗蝻密度增大，估计今年将有大量发生飞蝗的可能，因此现在尚未发生蝗蝻的地区，应立即进行深入检查，特别是对大片荒地如海滩、汛区盐碱荒地以及沼泽地带，更须加倍注意，做到“蝗蝻发生在那里，立即消灭在那里”。
                    主任  陈云  一九五一年六月二日
