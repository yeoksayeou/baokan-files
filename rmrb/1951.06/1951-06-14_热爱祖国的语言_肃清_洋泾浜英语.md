    Love the Motherland's Language, Eliminate "Pidgin English"
    To the Editor:
    Your article "On Cleansing the Russian Language" published on June 6th is of utmost importance. I fully agree with your borrowing of this famous short article by the great teacher Lenin to criticize the poor phenomenon of a small number of intellectuals today who abuse foreign vocabulary.
    In old China, some intellectuals, especially those deeply influenced by Anglo-American bourgeois culture, loved to intersperse some English or "Pidgin English" into the motherland's language. They even smugly said: "The Chinese vocabulary is too small to express my meaning, it is better to use English to be more straightforward." This is the evil consequence of imperialist cultural aggression for more than a hundred years, this is by no means "glory," but shame. Today, as Lenin said: "Isn't it time for us to declare war on the phenomenon of abuse of foreign vocabulary?"
    Our motherland's language is one of the most lively, rich, and beautiful languages in the world. We must love the great motherland's language, and we must thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialist cultural aggression and the bad phenomenon of using English or "Pidgin English" in the motherland's language.

### 热爱祖国的语言  肃清“洋泾浜英语”

专栏：读者来信

    热爱祖国的语言  肃清“洋泾浜英语”编辑同志：
    六月六日你们发表的《论清洗俄国语言》一文，是有极重要意义的。我完全赞成你们借用伟大导师列宁这篇著名的短文，来批评今天少数知识分子滥用外来语的恶劣现象。
    旧中国某些知识分子，特别是受英美资产阶级文化影响很深的人，最爱在祖国语言里夹用些英语或“洋泾浜英语”。他们还洋洋自得地说：“中国字汇太少，不能表达我的意思，不如用英语来得爽快。”这是百余年来帝国主义文化侵略的恶果，这决不是“光荣”，而是耻辱。今天，正如列宁所说：“难道现在还不是我们向滥用外来语的现象宣战的时候吗？”
    我们祖国的语言是世界上最活泼、丰富、优美的语言之一。我们要热爱伟大祖国的语言，我们要彻底肃清帝国主义文化侵略的影响，在祖国语言中夹用英语或者“洋泾浜英语”的恶劣现象。
