The Three Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves to Blow Up Bunkers
    ——Remembering the Glorious Deeds of Martyrs like Dong Cunrui

    During the Chinese People's Liberation War, countless outstanding Communist Party members in the Fourth Field Army sacrificed their most precious lives for the happy future of the people. In particular, the deeds of the three martyrs of the Fourth Field Army, Dong Cunrui, Liang Shiying, and Xu Hanlin, more clearly demonstrated the great qualities of Communist Party members. Their deeds will always be remembered by the people of the whole country.

    On May 25, 1948, the battle to liberate Longhua County, Rehe Province, began. The Chiang bandit army relied on bridge-shaped bunkers built on strategic terrain to stubbornly resist the advance of the People's Liberation Army. Dong Cunrui, a consistent model Communist Party member, accepted the blasting mission. When he carried the explosives, passed through the fire net, and rushed to the bottom of the bridge, he discovered that without a support to hold up the explosives, the bunker could not be destroyed. At this time, he thought that the victory of the battle and the liberation of the people of Longhua depended on him alone; sacrificing for the people was precisely the glory of a Communist Party member. He gritted his teeth, lifted the explosives with his left hand, and lit the fuse with his right hand. With a loud bang, the heroic Dong Cunrui perished together with the bunker. The troops, following his bloodstains, broke into Longhua.

    Inspired by Dong Cunrui's great spirit of self-sacrifice, the heroic deed of Communist Party member Liang Shiying sacrificing himself to blow up a pillbox emerged during the battle to liberate Jinzhou in September of the same year. During the breakthrough, the assault troops were blocked by the firepower from the enemy's pillbox. At this time, Liang Shiying picked up a demolition tube and charged up through the dense rain of bullets, inserting the demolition tube into the pillbox. When he pulled the detonator and was about to turn around and return, he saw the demolition tube being pushed out by the enemy. The squad leader saw the demolition tube already smoking and shouted anxiously: "Come back, it's going to explode!" But he thought that if the pillbox was not blown open, they could not break into Jinzhou, and for the victory of the people's cause, Liang Shiying should sacrifice himself. Ignoring the squad leader's shouts, he used all his strength to press the demolition tube firmly against the gun hole. With a deafening roar, Liang Shiying sacrificed himself, and the pillbox was also blown to pieces. The assault troops, like a sharp knife, plunged into Jinzhou.

    The heroic deeds of Dong Cunrui and Liang Shiying quickly spread throughout the army, and their spirit inspired every Communist Party member and non-Party member. On September 27, 1950, in the bandit suppression battle in Pangucun Village, Lingshan County, Guangdong Province, Xu Hanlin, another outstanding Party member similar to the two martyrs Dong and Liang, emerged. When the troops began to attack, the bandits used bunkers to block the troops' advance. Xu Hanlin picked up a pack of explosives and bravely charged forward. When he rushed to the front of the bunker, he discovered that the explosive pack had no fuse, and going back to get one would delay the battle. At this time, he thought of Dong Cunrui and Liang Shiying, and without hesitation, he pulled out a hand grenade to replace the fuse. With a loud bang, the hand grenade detonated the explosives, collapsing the bunker, and Xu Hanlin also sacrificed himself at this time.

    The heroic actions of these three martyrs have added a more glorious page to the annals of the Communist Party's wholehearted dedication to the people's cause. Their spirit has become a model for thousands of Communist Party members in the Fourth Field Army to learn from. Wang Yushan, the Communist Party member who used his own body to block the enemy's gun muzzle, is a typical example of studying the spirit of the martyrs.

    In order to commemorate their immortal achievements, the Fourth Field Army Party has made their deeds into picture stories, written them into articles, and displayed them in the Martyrs' Museum, so that the people of the whole country will always commemorate their great achievements, and all Party members will always learn from their spirit.

　　舍身炸碉堡的三烈士
    ——忆董存瑞等烈士的光荣事迹
    在我国人民解放战争中，第四野战军内无数优秀的共产党员，为了人民幸福的将来，献出了自己最宝贵的生命。特别是第四野战军董存瑞、梁士英、徐汉林三位烈士的事迹，更明显地表现出了共产党员的伟大品质。他们的事迹将永远被全国人民记得。
    一九四八年五月二十五日，解放热河省隆化县的战斗开始了。蒋匪军依托着筑在险要地势上的桥形碉堡，顽抗着解放军前进。一贯是模范的共产党员董存瑞接受了爆破任务。当他抱着炸药，穿过火网，冲到桥下的时候，发现如果没有炸药架把炸药托起，就不能炸毁碉堡。这时，他想到战斗的胜利、隆化人民的解放，都在他一个人身上；为人民牺牲，正是共产党员的光荣。他把牙一咬，左手托起炸药，右手拉着了火，轰隆一声，英雄的董存瑞和碉堡同归于尽，部队踏着他的血迹，突进隆化。
    在董存瑞伟大自我牺牲精神的感召下，同年九月解放锦州的战斗中，又出现了共产党员梁士英舍身炸地堡的英雄事迹。突破时，突击部队被敌人地堡里射出来的火力封住了。这时梁士英拿起爆破筒，从密集的弹雨里冲了上去，把爆破筒插到地堡里。当他拉着雷管，正想转身回来的时候，他看到爆破筒被敌人推出来了。班长看到爆破筒已经冒烟，急得直喊：“回来，要炸了。”但他想到炸不开地堡，就冲不进锦州，为了人民事业的胜利，梁士英应该牺牲自己。他不顾班长的叫喊，用尽全身的力量，把爆破筒死劲按在枪眼里。惊天动地的一声巨响，梁士英牺牲了，地堡也炸成粉碎。突击部队像一把尖刀，插进锦州。
    董存瑞、梁士英的英雄伟迹，迅速传遍全军，他们的精神激励着每个共产党员和非党群众。在一九五○年九月二十七日，广东省灵山县盘古村的剿匪战斗中，又出现了和董、梁二烈士同样的优秀党员徐汉林。部队在开始攻击时，土匪利用了碉堡封锁着部队前进，徐汉林抱起一包炸药，奋勇冲上去。当他冲到碉堡跟前，他发现炸药包上没有导火索，要回去再拿，就会延误战机。这时，他想起了董存瑞和梁士英，就毫不犹疑的拔出手榴弹，代替导火索，一声巨响，手榴弹炸响炸药，把碉堡炸塌了，徐汉林也在这时牺牲。
    这三位烈士的英雄行动，给共产党忠心耿耿为人民事业奋斗的史册上，更加添了光荣的一页。他们的精神，成为四野千万个共产党员学习的榜样。拿自己的肉体堵住敌人枪眼的共产党员王玉山，就是学习烈士精神中一个典型例子。
    四野党为了纪念他们不朽的功勋，把他们的事迹画成画传，写成文章，陈列在烈士博物馆内；让全国人民永远纪念着他们的伟绩，让全体党员永远学习着他们的精神。（四野新闻科）
