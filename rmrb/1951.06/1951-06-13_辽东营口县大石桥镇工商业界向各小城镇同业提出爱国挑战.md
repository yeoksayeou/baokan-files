The industrial and commercial circles of Dashiqiao Town, Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, have generally raised their political awareness since the launch of the campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries. We now unanimously respond to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, promote patriotic covenants, actively donate aircraft and artillery, do a good job of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and contribute all our strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers so that they can more effectively cooperate with the Korean People's Army to completely defeat the American bandits. Our various industries have held separate meetings, and everyone unanimously passed the following conditions to launch a patriotic challenge competition to the industrial and commercial circles of various small towns:

　　(1) Resolutely respond to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and launch a donation campaign for aircraft and artillery. In addition to actively launching tax payment competitions, our town's industry and commerce must do a good job in supply and marketing, connect urban and rural material exchanges, solve the needs of rural areas in a timely manner, and launch a patriotic movement to increase production and increase income. The more than 650 industrial and commercial households in the town are currently enthusiastically donating and have decided to donate 10 million yuan per month, starting in July and continuing until the victory of Resist America and Aid Korea.

　　(2) Universally establish and conscientiously implement patriotic covenants. Those who have already established patriotic covenants should conscientiously implement them and conduct inspections; those who have not established them should continue to establish them by industry. We must give full play to the effectiveness of patriotic covenants to promote various tasks.

　　(3) We must conscientiously and regularly do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. All our industrialists and businessmen must help the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers to carry out various handicrafts and temporary, seasonal sideline production, help them solve their financial difficulties, and help their children enter and continue their studies.

　　辽东营口县大石桥镇工商业界向各小城镇同业提出爱国挑战
    我们营口县大石桥镇工商业界自开展抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动以来，政治觉悟普遍地提高了一步。我们现在一致响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，推行爱国公约，积极捐献飞机大炮，做好优待烈属军属工作，贡献我们一切的力量支援中国人民志愿军，使他们更有力地配合朝鲜人民军彻底打垮美国强盗。我们各行业曾分别召开会议，大家一致通过以下条件向各小城镇的工商业界提出爱国主义的挑战竞赛。
    （一）坚决响应抗美援朝总会的号召，展开捐献飞机大炮运动。我们全镇工商业除积极展开纳税竞赛外，一定要搞好供销工作，沟通城乡物资交流，及时解决农村的需要，开展爱国主义的增加生产、增加收入运动。全镇工商业六百五十余户，目前就踊跃捐献，决定自七月份起一直到抗美援朝胜利结束为止，每月捐献人民币一千万元。
    （二）普遍订立和认真执行爱国公约。已订立爱国公约者应认真执行并进行检查；未订立者应继续按行按业订立。要充分发挥爱国公约的效能，推动各项工作。
    （三）我们要认真地经常地做好优待烈属军属工作。我们全体工商业者要帮助革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，进行各种手工业和临时性、季节性的副业生产，帮助他们解决资金的困难，并帮助他们的子女入学和升学。
