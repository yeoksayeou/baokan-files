To the Editor:

　　I am writing to report a great happy event in our township. A pumping machine has come to the countryside! Pengze County bought two pumping machines, one distributed to Linzi Township and one to Furong Township. Each machine has 72 horsepower and can pump water with a 1.4-foot diameter water pipe. The masses regard the pumping machine as a treasure. With the pumping machine, we can avoid some droughts and floods. The pumping machine was manufactured for us by the worker elder brothers of the Jiangxi Provincial Machinery Factory and was bought with a loan from the People's Government. We must use this pumping machine well and produce more grain to thank our worker elder brothers and our country.

　　江西彭泽县鳞字乡买回来了抽水机器编辑同志：
    向你报告我乡的一件大喜事。抽水机子下乡了。我们彭泽县买到了两部抽水机，分在鳞字乡一部，芙蓉乡一部。每部机器有七十二匹马力，可以用一尺四寸口径的水管子抽水。群众把抽水机看成宝贝，用抽水机抽水，就可以免除一部分旱灾和水灾。抽水机是江西省机器厂的工人老大哥给咱们制造的，是人民政府贷给咱们款子买到的。咱们一定要好好使用这架抽水机，多打些粮食，来感谢工人老大哥和咱们的国家。
