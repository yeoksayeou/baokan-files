Overseas Chinese Should Actively Support the Construction of the Motherland
Representative of the National People's Congress Guan Wensen

The most important proposal to be discussed at the Second Session of the National People's Congress is our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Its task is to establish a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization within these five years from 1953 to 1957, based on the national economic recovery in 1952; to establish a preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; and to establish a foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. In other words, it is to transform our country from an economically backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. This is a great event that is completely in line with the long-term and supreme interests of the Chinese people and future generations. As an old overseas Chinese, I feel infinitely honored to be able to participate in the discussion of such a major event. In a very excited mood, it seems that I have also become a young man.

To build China into a prosperous and happy country has been the common ideal of all people with lofty ideals for a hundred years. In particular, overseas Chinese living abroad have an even more ardent desire for this because of their personal experience. However, because old China was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, under the multiple exploitation and obstruction of the trinity of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, it was absolutely impossible for China to carry out construction according to its own wishes and become an industrial country. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, after the New Democratic Revolution of the Chinese people was completed in 1949, the people took control of their own destiny, and after the victory was achieved in the three-year economic recovery struggle, was it possible.

According to the first Five-Year Plan, we must concentrate our main forces on developing our country's heavy industry, which is completely correct. We know that without heavy industry, there can be no light industry of our own, let alone the construction of mechanized collective agriculture. Therefore, it is completely wrong for some people to think that we can first concentrate our main forces on developing light industry or agriculture. There are also some people who believe that because many regions in our country have abundant resources, industrial construction should be carried out simultaneously in all regions, which is also impossible. We should subordinate the interests of the region to the interests of the whole. In short, we must consider everything from the perspective of long-term interests; shortsightedness is unacceptable.

This draft Five-Year Plan was compiled under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and it was compiled after two and a half years of construction had already been carried out. Its content is built on a full factual basis. Therefore, we have every reason to believe that it can be completed on schedule and that it is possible to strive for over-fulfillment. However, we are not satisfied with such achievements. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out very objectively in his report on this plan: After the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, our production is still behind the capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain, and even Japan, but the speed of progress of the Chinese people in the past six years is far greater than that of these countries. And he stated definitively that we will catch up with the achievements of these capitalist countries in two hundred or one hundred years in just a few decades. We fully agree with Vice Premier Li's analysis and believe that under the pragmatic leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will continue to be victorious. Of course, to realize the Five-Year Plan is not such an easy task, and we still have many difficulties ahead of us. The first is the destruction and disruption that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will carry out against us with the assistance of American imperialism and its followers; the second is the issue of how to accumulate our construction funds; and the last is the issue of our country's technological backwardness. We must use all our strength to strive for the liberation of Taiwan and overcome the difficulties in funding and technology in order to realize our beautiful future. Therefore, I fully support the call of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian to practice strict economy, oppose waste, and severely punish corruption.

Overseas Chinese, the prosperous motherland that we have all eagerly hoped for in the past is already in sight, and it is a glorious and brilliant socialist motherland. I hope that you will support the great call of the motherland materially and spiritually, and strive to realize the first Five-Year Plan.

    侨胞们要积极支持祖国的建设
    全国人民代表大会代表　官文森
    全国人民代表大会第二次会议所要讨论的最主要的议案，是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。它的任务是在一九五二年全国经济恢复后的基础上，从一九五三年起到一九五七年这五年之内，建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。换言之，就是要把我国从经济落后的农业国变成为社会主义的工业国。这是完全符合于中国人民和后代子子孙孙的长远利益和最高利益的一件伟大的事。我作为一个老华侨，能够参加这样一件大事的讨论，是感到无限光荣的。在很兴奋的心情中，似乎自己也变成了一个少年。
    要想把中国建成一个富强康乐的国家，是一百年来所有一切有志之士的共同理想。特别是旅居海外的华侨，由于切身的体验，更具有这种热烈的愿望。然而由于旧中国是一个半封建半殖民地的国家，在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三位一体的层层剥削和阻碍之下，中国是绝对不可能按照自己的愿望进行建设而成为工业国家的。只有在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导之下，在一九四九年完成了中国人民的新民主主义革命，人民掌握了自己的命运，并在三年的经济恢复斗争取得胜利之后，才有可能。
    按照第一个五年计划，我们是要集中主要力量来发展我国的重工业，这是完全正确的。我们知道，没有重工业就不可能有自己的轻工业，更不能建设机械化的集体农业。所以，有些人以为可以先集中主要力量发展轻工业或农业，都是十分错误的。还有的人因为我国许多地区都有丰富的资源，所以就认为应该同时都进行工业建设，这也是不可能的。我们应该把地区的利益来服从整体的利益。总之，我们一切要从长远利益着眼，近视是要不得的。
    这个五年计划草案是在中国共产党中央委员会和毛主席的直接领导之下编制完成的，而且还是在已经进行了二年半的建设之后才编制完成的。它的内容是建筑在充分的事实基础之上的。因此，我们有完全的理由相信它可以按期完成，并且有可能争取超额完成。但是，我们并不以这样的成就为满足。李富春副总理在关于这个计划的报告中很客观地指出：在第一个五年计划完成之后，我们的生产还落后于美国和英国甚至日本这些资本主义国家，但中国人民六年来前进的速度是远远大过这些国家的。并且确定地说，我们要赶上这些资本主义国家两百年或一百年的成就，只要几十年。我们完全同意李副总理的分析，并且相信在共产党和毛主席的实事求是的领导之下，中国人民是能不断胜利的。当然，要实现五年计划，并不是那么容易的事，我们的面前还有许多困难。首先是蒋介石卖国集团在美国帝国主义和它的追随者们的协助之下所要进行的对我们的破坏和捣乱，其次是如何积累我们的建设资金问题，最后是我国技术上的落后问题。我们必须使用我们的一切力量来为解放台湾和克服资金问题和技术问题上的困难而努力，才能实现我们的美好将来。因此，我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理关于厉行节约、反对浪费、严惩贪污的号召。
    侨胞们，我们大家过去热烈希望的富强的祖国，已经在望了，而且它是光辉灿烂的社会主义的祖国。希望你们从物质上精神上来支持祖国的伟大号召，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
