The report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy is like a magnificent and brilliant picture, displaying the infinitely beautiful future of the motherland before the people and outlining the bright road to socialism for the motherland. The workers in the capital are all inspired by this plan and are willing to do their best to realize this great plan.

　　The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is holding a meeting of employee representatives. After seeing Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, the representatives at the meeting made a resolution, which stated: We warmly support the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. From the First Five-Year Plan, we can see the glorious path pointed out by the Party's general line. The resolution called on all employees to further carry out labor competitions, to strive for the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the national plan, for an annual increase of 26,276 tons of pig iron, and for an annual increase in production and savings of 11 million yuan. The workers of the Iron Smelting Department of the Iron and Steel Plant have been particularly enthusiastic in production these two days. From July 5, the opening day of the Second Session of the National People's Congress, to July 7, in addition to completing the operation plan every day, they produced an additional 134 tons of pig iron. Hou Decheng, a team leader of a blast furnace and a model worker in Beijing, said: The completion of the First Five-Year Plan will change the economic face of our country, lay the foundation for socialist industrialization, and gradually improve the people's lives. I am simply overjoyed. The focus of the First Five-Year Plan is industrial construction, and in industrial construction, emphasis is placed on developing heavy industry, which requires a large investment. To complete the Five-Year Plan, our iron and steel plant workers have a great responsibility. We must increase production, practice strict economy, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and overcome the idea of only focusing on production and not considering costs.

　　Many workshops and groups of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory read Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy yesterday at noon. The employees already knew that the Second Session of the First National People's Congress would pass China's First Five-Year Plan. On the eve of the congress, they launched a labor competition to offer new achievements in production as a gift to the congress. The Wang Wenyi team of the forging workshop's blanking group overfulfilled its task by 72.9% on the 7th. Li Hua, the leader of the plough repair group in the double-share plow workshop, said excitedly at yesterday's reading meeting: In order to realize the First Five-Year Plan, our group guarantees to complete the task ten days ahead of schedule this month. Ma Dianchun, a worker in the Model Group of Beijing car workers in the harvester workshop, said: The First Five-Year Plan calls on our workers to take the lead in realizing this plan. I guarantee to find a way to complete the active use of the car spindle sleeve, which originally took 20 workers, with 16 workers.

　　The editorial department of the "Tram Workers" newspaper of the Beijing Tram Company invited labor models and advanced producers yesterday to discuss Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy." Li Huaxin, a technician at the repair shop and a model worker in Beijing, said at the meeting: "In the past, I actively responded to the Party's call, worked hard in production, and strived to realize socialism. But what was the First Five-Year Plan? I only knew there were 156 industrial construction units, but what would they look like after completion? I didn't know either. Now, after reading Comrade Li Fuchun's report, I know, and my enthusiasm for hard work is even greater. I will work even harder to realize this great plan." Zhan Keqin, a driver at the maintenance workshop and a model worker in Beijing, said: "When I heard the broadcast, I was really happy. In the future, I will do my best to ensure safe driving and help young drivers improve their skills as soon as possible, so as to accelerate the realization of the First Five-Year Plan from this position."

　　The employees of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory were also very excited after seeing Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report. Zhang Congzhen, a model worker in Beijing and a weaver, said: The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the main force should be concentrated on developing heavy industry, and light industry should also be developed accordingly. The textile industry alone will invest 1.65 million spindles into production in five years. This economic construction plan is truly great. We must pay attention to saving and accumulate funds for the country bit by bit.

　　首都工人群众决心为实现五年计划而奋斗
    李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，像一幅宏伟的光辉灿烂的图画，在人们面前展出了祖国无限美好的未来，划出了祖国通向社会主义的光明道路。首都工人都为这个计划所鼓舞，都愿为实现这个伟大的计划而尽自己最大的努力。
    石景山钢铁厂正在举行职工代表会议，参加会议的代表看到了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告后，作出一项决议，决议中说：我们热烈拥护发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。从第一个五年计划中可以看到党的总路线指出的光辉的道路。决议号召全体职工进一步开展劳动竞赛，为全面完成和超额完成国家计划、为全年增产二万六千二百七十六吨生铁、为全年增产节约一千一百万元而奋斗。钢铁厂炼铁部工人这两天来生产情绪特别高涨，从七月五日全国人民代表大会第二次会议开幕这天起，到七月七日，除每天完成作业计划以外，又多生产了生铁一百三十四吨。某高炉值班工长、北京市劳动模范侯德成说：第一个五年计划的完成，将改变我国的经济面貌，为社会主义工业化打下基础，人民生活也将逐步得到改善，我简直有说不出来的高兴。第一个五年计划的中心是工业建设，在工业建设中，又着重发展重工业，需要很大的投资。为了完成五年计划，我们钢铁厂工人有很大责任，我们必须增加生产，厉行节约，学习苏联先进经验，克服只顾生产，不顾成本的思想。
    北京农业机械厂的许多车间和小组，昨天中午都读了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。职工们早已知道了第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议要通过我国第一个五年计划，就在大会召开前夕，展开了劳动竞赛，用生产上的新成绩向大会献礼。锻工车间下料组王文义班，在七日超额完成任务百分之七十二点九。双铧犁车间修犁组长李华，在昨天读报会上激动地说：为了实现第一个五年计划，我们小组这月，保证提前十天完成任务。收割机车间北京市模范小组车工二组工人马殿春说：第一个五年计划中号召我们工人得带头实现这个计划，我保证想办法把车主轴套原来得二十个工完成的活用十六个工完成。
    北京市电车公司“电车工人”报编辑部昨天约请了劳动模范和先进生产者，对李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”进行了座谈。修理厂车间技术员、北京市劳动模范李华鑫在会上说：“过去我就积极响应党的号召，努力生产，为实现社会主义而奋斗。可是第一个五年计划是什么？我只知有一百五十六个工业建设单位，建成后是什么样呢？我也不知道。现在看了李富春同志的报告，我知道了，我努力的劲头也更大了。我要为这一伟大计划的实现更加努力。”保养工场司机员、北京市劳动模范詹克勤说：“当我听到广播以后，我真高兴。今后我将尽我更大的力量，来保证安全行车，并帮助青年司机员尽快地提高技术，从这个岗位上加速第一个五年计划的实现。
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂职工看到李富春副总理的报告以后，也非常兴奋。北京市劳动模范、织布女工张从珍说：第一个五年计划规定要集中主要力量发展重工业，对轻工业也要相应地发展。光纺织工业在五年中投入生产的纺绽就有一百六十五万枚。这个经济建设计划真伟大。我们一定要注意节约，一点一滴地为国家积累资金。
