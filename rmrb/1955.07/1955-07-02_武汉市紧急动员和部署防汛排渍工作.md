　　Wuhan City Mobilizes and Deploys Flood Prevention and Drainage Work Urgently
    The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee held a meeting on June 30th to urgently mobilize and deploy city-wide flood prevention and drainage work.

    The meeting analyzed the current water situation in Wuhan, pointing out that the main characteristic of this year's water situation is rapid and sharp rise. Since June 20th, the water level at Wuhan Customs has risen by an average of more than five centimeters per day, an unprecedented rate of increase in history.

    Based on the development of the water situation and the city's flood prevention plan and measures for this year, the meeting decided to immediately begin the following flood prevention projects: building the riprap revetment of the Zhanggong Dike in Hankou, Changfeng South Embankment, Changfeng North Embankment, and the lower section of the Wuqing Dike in Wuchang to an elevation of 29 meters; reinforcing, raising, and thickening weak links and sections in the pre-flood embankment projects; collecting and transporting flood control materials such as reeds, grass bags, and reed mats; and gradually closing the active sluice gates along the Yangtze and Han River embankments.

    To ensure the completion of flood prevention projects, the meeting requested that all relevant departments in the city strongly support flood prevention work, help solve problems such as electricity, lighting, and telecommunications for flood prevention projects, procurement, transportation, and supply of flood prevention materials, and medical and health issues. The Municipal Flood Control Headquarters and its subordinate flood control headquarters should increase the number of full-time cadres, improve the flood control teams, and organize a certain number of people to begin patrolling and guarding the embankments.

    The meeting decided that Wuhan City will immediately establish drainage institutions, concentrating approximately 4,000 horsepower of water pumps in the city to begin draining accumulated water caused by heavy rains; and establish a drainage station in Daijiashan, in the northeast suburbs of Hankou, to drain the accumulated water from the farmland around Dasai Lake in the northern suburbs to outside the Zhanggong Dike. Residents in areas flooded by stagnant water will be handled and properly resettled by the government.

    At 2:00 PM on June 30th, the water level at Wuhan Customs had risen to 26.03 meters, approaching the warning water level (26.30 meters). The river water has risen to the foot of the city's embankments, and the sluice gates along the Yangtze and Han River embankments began to be closed on the evening of June 29th.

　　武汉市紧急动员和部署防汛排渍工作
    武汉市人民委员会六月三十日召开会议，紧急动员和部署全市防汛、排渍工作。
    会议分析了当前武汉市的水情，指出今年水情的主要特点是上涨猛和快。武汉关水位从六月二十日以来，平均每天上涨五公寸多，上涨速度是历史上少有的。
    根据水情发展和今年全市防汛工作方案和措施，会议决定立刻开始进行下列防汛工程：把汉口张公堤、长丰南垸、长丰北垸和武昌武青堤下段的块石护坡，砌筑到标高二十九公尺；加固、加高和培厚汛前堤防工程中的薄弱环节和薄弱堤段；筹集、运送芦苇、草袋、芦席等防浪材料；逐步关闭沿长江、汉水堤防线上的活动闸门。
    为了保证完成防汛工程，会议要求全市有关部门大力支援防汛工作，帮助解决防汛工程所需要的电力、照明和电讯联络，防汛器材物资的采购、运输、供应和医疗卫生等问题。市防汛总指挥部和所属各防汛指挥部应增调专职干部，健全防汛队伍，并组织一定人力，开始巡查和护卫堤防。
    会议决定，武汉市立刻成立排渍机构，把全市约合四千匹马力的抽水机集中起来，开始排除市内因暴雨造成的积水；并在汉口东北郊戴家山建立排水站，把北部郊区大赛湖周围农田的积水排向张公堤外。被渍水所淹地区的居民，由政府统一处理、妥善安置。
    六月三十日下午二时武汉关的水位已上涨到二十六点零三公尺，接近了警戒水位（二十六点三零公尺）。江水已经上升到全市堤防脚下，沿长江、汉水堤线上的闸门已在六月二十九日晚上开始关闭。　（新华社）
