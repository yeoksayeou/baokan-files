Xinhua News Agency, London, July 13th: TASS reported that British society is showing great interest in the upcoming Geneva Four-Power Summit and demanding that the British delegation adopt a position conducive to the success of the meeting.

    A resolution was unanimously passed at a gathering in Reading (Berkshire) demanding that Prime Minister Eden seek agreements at the meeting on issues such as German unification, European security, universal disarmament, and the Taiwan issue.
    Trade unions of miners, engineers, electrical workers, boilermakers, and painters in several Scottish cities have also passed resolutions calling on Eden to work towards the success of the Geneva Conference.
    Members of the Reading Peace Committee are collecting signatures for an appeal calling on the Prime Minister to work towards banning the hydrogen bomb and admitting the People's Republic of China into the United Nations.
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 13th: TASS reported that Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, told a "News Daily" reporter that he was awaiting the Geneva Conference with great concern.

    Herriot believes that this conference "could become a very significant event, the beginning of a new era in history, the first truly serious effort to combat all the war disasters that threaten humanity."
    Speaking about France's policy on the issue of East-West reconciliation, Herriot emphasized: "No consideration of domestic order should outweigh the necessity of France pursuing a policy of peace. This peace is a balanced peace, not a peace based on accidental alliances and unstable coalitions."
    Herriot concluded by expressing his hope that "constructive action will unite European countries in the long period to come." He added: "I stand at the forefront of those who hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve the results they have long awaited."
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 13th: TASS reported that on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, the broad French public is persistently demanding that the French government adopt a policy that promotes the success of the meeting.

    According to democratic newspapers, the working people of many cities and villages are electing representatives to send them to Geneva to express the French people's desire for national independence, relaxation of international tensions, and consolidation of peace.
    A delegation composed of celebrities from the Sixth District of Paris visited the office of the French Prime Minister and left a letter for Prime Minister Faure. The letter emphasized that France has a vital interest in the success of the Geneva Conference, and the French head of government must adopt an independent position at the meeting. The French government can and must demand that the conference lead to a peaceful resolution of the German question, the establishment of a European security system, and the conclusion of disarmament agreements. Signatories to the letter included Professor Aubert, industrialist Carnot, writer Sartre, Matté, a member of the directing committee of the Executive Bureau of the Union of French Women, and Bravier, secretary of the French Veterans Union, among others.
    The councilors of the Rollyon Municipal Council of Morbihan Province—including communists, socialists, radical socialists, Gaullists, and Popular Republicans—unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the French government adopt an independent position at the Geneva Conference that fully conforms to the interests of the French people, the interests of the entire country, and the cause of peace.
    "L'Humanité" sharply condemned the government majority in the National Assembly for refusing to arrange a debate on French foreign policy before the opening of the Geneva Conference. "L'Humanité" said: "In any case, the government cannot prevent the debate that is already underway across the country. During these debates, the French people have expressed their hope that the Four-Power Conference should be successful."
