Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 22nd: The heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting on the afternoon of the 21st.

The meeting was chaired by Nikolai Bulganin, head of the Soviet government delegation. He said that the foreign ministers of the four countries held a meeting on the morning of the 21st and exchanged views on the instructions they should follow when discussing the issues on the conference agenda in the future. The foreign ministers made some progress, but had not yet finished discussing the recommendations on drafting the aforementioned instructions.

Bulganin then said that it would be appropriate for the foreign ministers to continue exchanging views to produce a recommendation that the heads of government could unanimously agree on.

Eisenhower, Faure, and Eden agreed with the Chairman's suggestion.

Next, Bulganin made some supplementary remarks on the issue of European security.

Bulganin said that we all now agree to hand over the Soviet government's suggestions on the issue of European collective security, as well as other suggestions on this issue put forward during the discussion, to the foreign ministers for discussion. However, it will take a considerable amount of time to discuss these issues and reach the necessary agreements on them, especially because other relevant countries should participate in the discussion at a certain stage. However, according to the current situation in Europe, measures must be taken now to prevent a situation in Europe that may threaten the peace and security of the people of European countries.

Bulganin said that concluding a treaty between the participating countries of existing groups in Europe would be in line with this goal. The treaty stipulates that these countries undertake the following obligations: not to use armed forces to deal with each other, not to threaten with the use of armed forces, and to resolve their differences entirely through peaceful means.

After pointing out that such a treaty would help ease tensions in Europe and consolidate universal peace, Bulganin, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, submitted a proposal to the meeting for discussion. The proposal put forward the basic principles of the treaty suggested by the Soviet delegation.

The heads of government of the four countries decided to hand over the Soviet proposal to the foreign ministers for preliminary discussion.

The meeting participants then discussed the third item on the agenda - the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Bulganin spoke on this issue. He said that the Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to make some supplementary explanations to the opinions he expressed on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons in his speech on the 18th, and to submit relevant suggestions to the meeting for discussion.

Bulganin pointed out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have not yet stated their position on the Soviet government's proposals put forward on May 10 this year on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars. He said that we hope to know their views on the issues we have raised.

Bulganin said that a broad disarmament plan can only be realized when the "Cold War" is ended and the necessary trust is established in relations between countries (regrettably, there is no such trust now). We should first work together on the first two aspects.

Bulganin mentioned that the Soviet government put forward relevant suggestions in its draft declaration to the United Nations Disarmament Commission on May 10. He emphasized that the reason why the Soviet government mentioned stopping the "Cold War" was not because the "Cold War" brought more anxiety to the Soviet Union than to other countries, but because the atmosphere created by the "Cold War" was incompatible with the common desire of the meeting participants to establish good relations with each other. Bulganin said that it would be appropriate to jointly recommend that the United Nations adopt a declaration with such or similar purposes to stop the "Cold War", ease international tensions, and establish the necessary trust in relations between countries. Otherwise, it will not be possible to seriously talk about resolving outstanding international issues.

Bulganin then said that the Soviet government also believes that it is appropriate for the meeting to reach a consensus on certain basic measures that must be implemented in terms of disarmament. This refers to measures on which the countries attending this meeting have either completely the same attitude or are already very close.

First of all, the consensus that has been reached on the level of the number of armed forces in the five major powers of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France should be affirmed.

Bulganin mentioned that on this issue, the Soviet government has agreed to the Western countries' suggestion that the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should each be set at one million to one and a half million people, and Britain and France should each be set at 650,000 people. Bulganin then said that the issue of China's armed forces should be studied with the participation of the government of the People's Republic of China. As for other countries, the army of each country should not exceed 150,000 to 200,000 people, and this should be agreed upon at an appropriate international conference.

Bulganin also talked about another important issue, namely the issue of atomic weapons. He said that the Soviet government agrees that the work of banning atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should be carried out in stages. The draft resolution on disarmament issues submitted by the Soviet delegation to this meeting takes into account the attitudes of the United States, Britain, and France, and puts forward corresponding suggestions.

Bulganin then said that an agreement should be reached that before the agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons comes into effect, the countries participating in the meeting undertake the solemn obligation not to use such weapons. In the event that the Security Council passes a corresponding resolution, an exception may be made for the purpose of defending against aggression. Bulganin said that it must also be pointed out that we believe that effective international supervision should be established to supervise the implementation of measures on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The adoption of a unanimously agreed resolution on the above-mentioned issues by the meeting would greatly help prepare for an international disarmament conference in the United Nations.

Bulganin went on to say that the Soviet government believes that it is not necessary to wait for the conclusion of a general international convention - because the conclusion of this convention may take a considerable amount of time, an agreement should be reached at the current meeting: France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union undertake the obligation not to be the first to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons against any country, and call on all other countries to join this declaration.

Bulganin said that based on the reasons he explained, the Soviet delegation submitted a draft resolution of the Four-Power Government Heads Meeting on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons to the meeting for discussion.

When explaining the United States' attitude towards the issues under discussion, US President Eisenhower said that he did not want to engage in academic debates, but was prepared to talk about the practical aspects of the issue. Eisenhower said that the United States began disarmament after World War II. According to Eisenhower, however, the events that occurred abroad showed that the United States had gone too far in its disarmament plan, so the United States began to re-expand its armed forces. He said that the United States has decided to maintain, and if necessary, increase its military strength over a long period of time, as long as it is necessary to defend peace. He said that the best way to defend peace and ensure the security of the United States is a system that can reduce the level and scale of armed forces of all countries. Eisenhower said that therefore, the United States government is prepared to participate in a suitable treaty that can be trusted and can reduce and reduce the level and scale of armed forces of all countries. He said that if the agreement is not fully integrated with the system of inspection and disclosure, it is impossible to reach a reasonable and reliable agreement. According to Eisenhower, no scientific inspection method or other inspection method has yet been found to ensure the abolition of atomic weapons.

Eisenhower said that therefore, many of the disarmament proposals put forward in the past went further than what could be done under an effective inspection system.

Eisenhower said that his words were mainly addressed to the Soviet delegation, because the two major countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, possess new and terrible weapons that cause people to worry about the possibility of a sudden attack. He suggested that the two countries should take practical measures. He said that these measures include: providing each other with full plans for military strength, and providing each other with the opportunity to conduct aerial photography in any part of their own country to prevent the possibility of a sudden attack. Eisenhower said that this would help establish a more effective system of inspection and disarmament, but this is only a beginning.

Eisenhower said that his suggestion is to instruct the representatives of the four countries in the disarmament subcommittee to give priority to the inspection and disclosure system when working within the United Nations. This system may include gradual experimentation with inspection methods. Eisenhower believes that this would greatly promote mutual trust, which would pave the way for the progress of the people of all countries.

Eisenhower stressed in his speech that safeguarding peace is the most important responsibility of politicians, and security can only be obtained through patient work.

Faure, representing the French delegation, expressed agreement with Eisenhower's speech. He expressed his firm belief that this meeting would give new impetus to the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission's subcommittee, and that the four-country representatives in this subcommittee should be given some suggestions. Faure said that the issue of supervision is the central issue of disarmament. He said that some of the reasons put forward by Eisenhower make people believe that certain organizational work can be carried out in terms of supervision. He pointed out that the method of supervising budgets is appropriate. According to him, this supervision can supplement the system of supervision by inspection methods.

Faure then said that the center of the disarmament issue is that every major country should disarm. Before reducing armaments, armaments should be restricted, and a level that should not be exceeded should be stipulated. When the issue of not increasing armaments is resolved, measures can be taken to reduce armaments. Faure also pointed out that the link between reducing armaments and using the money saved from reducing armaments for other purposes should be determined.

Faure finally said that the French delegation is ready to submit a memorandum on this issue tomorrow.

Eden clarified the attitude of the British delegation.

He said that after World War II, Britain began to reduce its armed forces. But, according to him, because not everyone thought it was possible to reduce their armed forces, and because the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe were still maintained at a high level, Britain began to rearm, and in the process of rearming, it manufactured atomic bombs, and is now manufacturing hydrogen bombs. Eden then said that he welcomed the Soviet Union's proposal submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Commission's subcommittee on May 10, because these proposals included several points from the proposals of Britain and France. Eden said that it is appropriate to continue discussing the Soviet proposal and other proposals in the aforementioned subcommittee. Eden then said that he fully supported Eisenhower's view that no disarmament plan can be accepted without first having a system of inspection and disclosure that is sufficient to implement the disarmament plan at each stage. Eden said that it seems that everyone agrees on this point.

Eden said that the Soviet government was quite right in linking the issue of disarmament with the issue of establishing international trust in its May 10th proposal. He said that it is not possible now to expect international trust to be so deep that an entire disarmament plan can be drafted and implemented at the same time.

This task must be solved in stages. In this regard, Eden said that he agreed with Eisenhower's suggestion on the exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States. Eden then said that he had a simple suggestion that could be adopted immediately, which is: to have both sides send inspection teams to carry out inspections in a certain area on both sides of the demarcation line between East and West. Eden added that his proposal would give new impetus to the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission's subcommittee.

Bulganin, who was in the chair, pointed out that the frank speeches made by the heads of state at the meeting were undoubtedly of great significance for the successful resolution of the issue. He believed that efforts should be made to formulate some unanimously agreed recommendations to be handed over to the United Nations. He suggested instructing the foreign ministers of the four countries to draft these draft recommendations.

Eisenhower expressed agreement with this proposal, saying that this proposal is the best procedure for studying the issue.

Faure and Eden also agreed with Bulganin's proposal.

The meeting adjourned at this point. The foreign ministers of the four countries will hold a meeting at 10:00 am on the 22nd. The heads of the four countries will hold a meeting in the afternoon.

    四国政府首脑会议讨论裁军问题
    苏联提出关于裁军的决议草案
    并建议欧洲现有国家集团缔结安全条约
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社日内瓦二十二日讯：苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑二十一日下午举行会议。
    会议由苏联政府代表团团长布尔加宁担任主席。他说，四国外长二十一日上午举行了会议，就将来他们在讨论会议议程上所列的问题时需要遵循的指示问题，交换了意见。外长们取得了一些进展，但是，还没有讨论完关于拟订上述指示的建议。
    布尔加宁接着说，由外长们继续交换意见以拟出一个政府首脑可以一致同意的建议，是适当的。
    艾森豪威尔、富尔和艾登表示同意主席的建议。
    接着，布尔加宁就欧洲安全问题作了一些补充说明。
    布尔加宁说，现在，我们大家都同意把苏联政府关于欧洲集体安全问题的建议以及在讨论中提出的关于这个问题的其他建议交给外长们讨论，但是，为了讨论这些问题和就这些问题达成必要的协议，需要相当的时间才能办到，尤其是因为到一定的阶段，应当有其他有关国家参加讨论。然而，根据目前欧洲的情况，必须现在就采取措施，来防止在欧洲造成一种可能使欧洲各国人民的和平和安全遭到威胁的局势。
    布尔加宁说，在欧洲现有集团的参加国之间缔结一个条约是符合这个目的的。这个条约规定这些国家承担下列义务：不得使用武装力量来互相对付，不得以使用武装力量来进行威胁，完全通过和平途径来解决它们之间的分歧。
    布尔加宁在指出这样一种条约有助于缓和欧洲的紧张局势和巩固普遍和平之后，代表苏联代表团将一项建议提交会议讨论。建议中提出了苏联代表团建议的条约的基本原则。
    四国政府首脑决定将苏联的建议交给外长们进行初步讨论。
    会议参加者接着讨论议程上的第三项——关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题。
    布尔加宁就这一问题发言。他说，苏联代表团认为，必须对他在十八日发言时就裁减军备和禁止原子武器所谈的意见，作一些补充说明，并将有关的建议提交会议讨论。
    布尔加宁指出，美、英、法三国政府还没有对苏联政府在今年五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议表明它们的态度。他说，我们希望知道它们对我们所提出的问题的看法。
    布尔加宁说，只有在结束了“冷战”；在国与国之间的关系中建立了必要的信任（遗憾的是，现在还没有这种信任）的情况下，才可能实现广泛的裁军计划。首先应当在前两方面共同努力。
    布尔加宁提到，苏联政府在它五月十日向联合国裁军委员会提出的宣言草案中提出了有关的建议。他着重指出，苏联政府之所以提到停止“冷战”，并不是因为“冷战”给苏联带来的不安大于其他国家，而是因为“冷战”造成的气氛同会议参加者希望互相间建立良好关系这一共同愿望是不相容的。布尔加宁说，共同建议联合国通过一个这样的或者类似的目的在停止“冷战”、缓和国际紧张局势和在国与国之间的关系中建立必要的信任的宣言，是适当的。否则，就不能认真谈到解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    布尔加宁接着说，苏联政府还认为，会议就必须在裁减军备方面实施的某些基本措施达成一致意见，是适当的。这里所指的是这样一些措施，出席这次会议的国家在这些措施上的态度或者是完全相同，或者已经非常接近。
    首先应当把在美、苏、中、英、法五大国的武装部队数量的水平方面已经达成的一致意见肯定下来。
    布尔加宁提到，在这个问题上，苏联政府已经同意西方国家的建议，即规定美、苏、中三国的武装部队各为一百万到一百五十万人，英国和法国各为六十五万人。布尔加宁接着说，关于中国的武装部队的问题，应当在中华人民共和国政府的参加下予以研究。至于其他的国家，每一个国家的军队不得超过十五万到二十万人，关于这一点，应当在适当的国际会议上商定。
    布尔加宁还谈到另一个重要问题，即关于原子武器的问题。他说，苏联政府同意，禁止原子武器和氢武器的工作应该分阶段进行，苏联代表团提出的这次会议关于裁军问题的决议草案中，在考虑到美、英、法三国的态度下，提出了相应的建议。
    布尔加宁接着说，应该取得协议，在关于完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的协议生效以前，参加会议的国家承担不使用这种武器的庄严的义务。在安全理事会通过相应的决定的情况下，用于防御侵略的目的的可以是例外。布尔加宁说，还必须指出，我们认为，应当建立有效的国际监督，以监督关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的实行。会议就上述问题通过一致同意的决议会大大有助于在联合国中筹备国际裁军会议。
    布尔加宁接着说道，苏联政府认为，不必等待一个总的国际公约的缔结——因为缔结这个公约可能需要相当的时间，在现在的会议上就应该取得协议：法国、英国、美国和苏联承担义务不首先对任何一个国家使用原子武器和氢武器，并且呼吁所有其他国家加入这一宣言。
    布尔加宁说，苏联代表团根据它所阐明的理由，把一项四国政府首脑会议关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的决议草案提交会议讨论。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在阐明美国对所讨论的问题的态度时说，他不想作学院式的辩论，而准备谈问题的实际方面。艾森豪威尔说，美国在第二次世界大战后就开始了裁军。照艾森豪威尔说，但是，国外所发生的事态表明，美国在裁军计划上走得过远了，因此美国开始重新扩充自己的武装力量。他说，美国决定只要为保卫和平所必需，就要在一个长时期内保持、在必要的情况下并且增加它的军事力量。他说，但是保卫和平和保障美国安全的最好的办法就是能够降低各国武装力量水平和缩小它的规模的制度。艾森豪威尔说，因此，美国政府准备参加一种可以信赖的并且能使各国武装力量的水平和规模降低和缩小的适宜的条约。他说，如果协议不同视察和公布的制度完全结合起来，就不可能达成一个合理而可靠的协议。照艾森豪威尔说，现在还没有找到一种科学的视察办法或者是其他视察办法可以确保废除原子武器。
    艾森豪威尔说，因此，过去提出的许多关于裁军的建议都超过根据有效的视察制度所能做到的较远。
    艾森豪威尔说，他的话主要是对苏联代表团讲的，因为苏联和美国两大国拥有使人担心可能发生突然进攻的新的可怕武器。他建议两国应采取实际的措施。他说，这些措施中包括：彼此提供关于军事力量的充分计划，彼此提供在自己国家任何一部分进行空中摄影的机会，以防止突然进攻的可能性。艾森豪威尔说，这有助于建立更为有效的视察和裁军制度，但是这仅是一个开端。
    艾森豪威尔说，他的建议是，训令四国在裁军小组委员会中的代表在联合国范围内进行工作时优先考虑视察和公布制度。这种制度可以包括对视察方法的逐步试验。艾森豪威尔认为，这会大大促进互相信任，而这种信任会替各国人民的进步开辟道路。
    艾森豪威尔发言里着重说，保障和平是政治家们最重要的职责，只有进行耐心的工作才能获得安全。
    富尔代表法国代表团表示同意艾森豪威尔的发言。他表示深信这次会议会给联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的工作以新的推动力，并且应该给予这个小组委员会里的四国代表一些建议。富尔说，监督问题是裁军的中心问题，他说艾森豪威尔提出的一些理由使人相信，可以在监督方面进行某些组织工作。他指出，监督预算的方法是适宜的。照他说，这种监督可以补充用视察方法进行监督的制度。
    富尔接着说，裁军问题的中心就是每个大国都要裁军。在裁减军备之前应该对军备进行限制，规定不得超过的水平。当不增加军备的问题解决了之后，就可以采取措施来裁减军备。富尔还指出，应该把裁减军备和因裁减军备而誊出的钱用在其他用途上这两者之间的联系确定下来。
    富尔最后说，法国代表团明天准备提出关于这个问题的备忘录。
    艾登阐明了英国代表团的态度。
    他说，在第二次世界大战后，英国开始裁减自己的武装力量。但是，照他说，因为并不是所有的人都认为裁减自己的武装力量是可能的，而且欧洲的武装部队和常规军备还保持在很高的水平上，因此英国又开始重新进行武装，并且在重新武装的过程中制造了原子弹，现在又正在制造氢弹。艾登接着说，他欢迎苏联五月十日在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出的建议，因为这些建议中包括了英、法两国建议中的若干点。艾登说，继续在上述小组委员会中讨论苏联的建议和其他建议是适宜的。艾登接着说，他完全支持艾森豪威尔的意见，即如果不先有一个使得在每个阶段足以实现裁军计划的视察和公布制度，那末任何的裁军计划都是不能予以接受的。艾登说，看起来，大家在这一点上是一致同意的。
    艾登说，苏联政府在它五月十日的建议中把裁军问题同建立国际间信任的问题联系起来，这是十分正确的。他说，现在不可能指望国际间的信任有这样深的程度，以致于可以拟定出整个裁军计划同时就加以实现。
    这个任务必须分阶段解决。在这方面，艾登说，他同意艾森豪威尔关于苏美两国交换军事情报的建议。艾登接着说，他有一个可以立即被采纳的简单建议，这个建议就是：由双方派遣视察队在沿东方和西方分界线的两边的一定区域中实行视察。艾登又说，他的建议会给联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的工作以新的推动力。
    担任主席的布尔加宁指出，各国首脑在会上所作的坦率的发言，对圆满解决问题无疑是有重要意义的。他认为，应当设法拟定一些一致同意的建议交给联合国，他建议训令四国外交部长来草拟这些建议草案。
    艾森豪威尔表示同意这个提议，他说，这个提议是研究问题的最好的程序。
    富尔和艾登也同意布尔加宁的提议。
    会议至此休会。四国外长将在二十二日上午十时举行会议。四国首脑将在下午举行会议。
