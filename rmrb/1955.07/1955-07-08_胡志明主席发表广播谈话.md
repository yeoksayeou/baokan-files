Xinhua News Agency, July 7th:

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio address on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 7th.

　　At the beginning of his talk, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in Chinese:

　　"Dear Chinese friends: Radio Beijing has invited me to speak with you. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak with 600 million Chinese friends. However, I do not speak Chinese well, so now I will speak in Vietnamese."

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh then said in Vietnamese:

　　"First of all, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, I extend my dear greetings to the Chinese people.

　　I and the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were invited to visit China, which further strengthened the fraternal friendship between our two peoples that has existed for thousands of years. We feel extremely excited.

　　The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people received us with extreme warmth, as if receiving relatives returning from afar, which deeply moved us.

　　We were very happy to see Chairman Mao and all the responsible comrades in good health, full of energy, and in good spirits.

　　We have visited some factories, farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and schools. Wherever we went, we saw a thriving upsurge in the construction of socialism. In the factories, we saw labor models and workers mastering new machines. Productivity is increasing day by day. In the countryside, we saw fertile fields and green crops, like a splendid pattern woven by the laboring hands of millions of farmers. Beside the renovated and expanded old city streets, roads, and buildings, we saw more and more new buildings and streets.

　　In short, the things we saw and heard made us foresee that, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Government, and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the enthusiastic production spirit of the Chinese people, the Five-Year Plan will surely be a complete success. This makes us very happy, because we regard the victory of the Chinese people as the same as the victory of the Vietnamese people.

　　I love children the most, so as soon as I arrived in Beijing, I visited nurseries and primary schools. Seeing the children so well-behaved, chubby, healthy, and lively, I felt very happy. At the same time, I thought to myself: These children will be the citizens of the future communist society, and we are fighting for the cause of communism today.

　　We are pleased to see these wonderful achievements. These achievements are the initial results of the heroic struggle of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese working people for decades.

　　Now, I will briefly talk about the situation in Vietnam.

　　Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are actively struggling to consolidate peace, achieve reunification, and complete the independence and democracy of the country. We have many difficulties, but we are not afraid of difficulties. Because of our own efforts, because of the support of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, and because of the sympathy of the peace-loving people of Southeast Asia and the world, we firmly believe that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve complete victory.

　　Words are short, but feelings are deep. Before ending my talk, I wish the Chinese people good health and continuous progress in their work. I give a loving kiss to the Chinese children.

　　During my stay in Beijing, I received many letters of greetings from Chinese friends. I would like to express my gratitude here.

　　Long live the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people!

　　Long live world peace!"

　　胡志明主席发表广播谈话
    新华社七日讯　越南民主共和国主席胡志明应中央人民广播电台邀请，七日在中央广播电台发表了广播谈话。
    胡志明主席在谈话开始的时候，用中国话说：
    “亲爱的中国朋友们：北京广播电台请我和你们谈话。我有机会和六亿中国朋友谈话，心里感到十分愉快。但是，我说中国话说不好，现在我说越南话。”
    胡志明主席接着用越南话说：
    “我首先代表越南人民向中国人民致亲爱的敬礼。
    我和越南民主共和国政府代表团应邀访问中国，进一步加强了我们两国人民之间的几千年来就一直存在着的兄弟般的友谊，我们感到无比兴奋。
    中国共产党、中国政府和人民极其热烈地接待我们，像接待从远方回来的亲人一样，使我们十分感动。
    我们看到毛主席和各位负责同志都身体健康精神饱满和愉快而感到非常高兴。
    我们已经参观了一些工厂、农场、农业生产合作社和学校等地方。我们走到那里，都看到了为建设社会主义而展开的蓬蓬勃勃的热潮。在工厂，我们看见劳动模范和工人们掌握着新的机器。生产率日益提高。在农村，我们看见肥沃的田地和青绿的庄稼，好像一幅由千百万农民的劳动的手织成的锦绣图案一样。在修整了的和扩建了的旧的市街、道路和大厦的旁边，我们看到了越来越多的新的大楼和街道。
    总而言之，我们见到的和听到的事情，使我们预见到：由于中国共产党、中国政府和毛主席的英明的领导，由于中国人民的积极生产的热情，五年计划是一定能够得到美满的成功的。这一点，使我们非常高兴，因为我们把中国人民的胜利，看作和越南人民自己的胜利一样。
    我最爱儿童，因此，刚到北京，就去参观托儿所和小学校。看见孩子们又乖，又胖，又健康，又活泼，我感到十分高兴。同时，我心里想：这些孩子们将是未来的共产主义社会的公民，而我们今天正在为共产主义事业而奋斗。
    我们愉快地看到这些美好的成绩。这些成绩都是伟大的中国共产党和伟大的中国劳动人民几十年来英勇奋斗的初步结果。
    现在，我简单地谈谈越南的情况。
    越南人民在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，正在积极地为巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国的独立和民主而斗争。我们有许多困难，但是我们不怕困难。因为由于我们自己的努力，由于苏联、中国和各兄弟国家的支持，由于东南亚和世界爱好和平的各国人民的同情，我们坚决相信：我们一定能克服一切困难，得到完全的胜利。
    话短情长，在结束谈话之前，我祝贺中国人民身体健康，工作不断进步。我亲密地和中国儿童们接吻。
    我在北京期间，接到不少中国朋友写给我的问好的信。我在这里谨表示谢意。
    越中两国人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！”（附图片）
