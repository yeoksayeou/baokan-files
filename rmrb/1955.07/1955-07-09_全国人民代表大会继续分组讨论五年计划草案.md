Xinhua News Agency, July 8th. The Second Session of the First National People's Congress today continued group readings and discussions of the Draft First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China.

Many representative groups have begun to read and discuss the industrial part of the Draft First Five-Year Plan. Responsible staff members dispatched by the State Council of the People's Republic of China continued to answer the questions raised by the representatives.

In the discussions, many representatives expressed their opinions in connection with the characteristics of different economic regions. During the Shanghai representative group's discussion of the distribution of industrial areas, some representatives pointed out that many industries in Shanghai are far from the sources of raw materials and product sales areas, which is extremely unreasonable. Some representatives of the Gansu Province representative group expressed their opinions on the development of animal husbandry and closing hillsides for afforestation in Gansu. Many representatives also related specific cases of waste they had learned about in their work, illustrating the importance of Vice Premier Li Fuchun's call in his report on the Five-Year Plan to increase production and practice strict economy.

　　全国人民代表大会继续分组讨论五年计划草案
    新华社八日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今日继续分组阅读和讨论中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案。
    许多代表小组已开始阅读和讨论第一个五年计划草案的工业部分。中华人民共和国国务院派出的负责工作人员继续对代表们提出的问题进行解答。
    在讨论中，许多代表都联系到不同经济地区的特点发表意见。上海市代表小组在讨论工业地区的分布问题时，有的代表指出上海许多工业远离原料产地和产品销地，这种状态极不合理。甘肃省代表小组有的代表就在甘肃发展畜牧业和封山育林等问题，发表了意见。不少代表还联系自己在工作中所了解的浪费的具体情况，说明李富春副总理关于五年计划的报告中提出的增加生产、厉行节约的号召的重要意义。
