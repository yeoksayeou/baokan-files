On the Road to Socialist Industrialization

At the upcoming Second Session of the First National People's Congress, decisions will be made regarding the First Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy. The people of the entire nation are ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of our nation's First Five-Year Plan with heroic labor, a high degree of patriotism, and a spirit of hard work.

During the First Five-Year Plan, there are over 600 major industrial construction projects. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of workers nationwide have already built many new types of factories and mines, and produced new products that our country had never been able to produce before, such as large-scale steel, machine tools, gauges, and cutting tools, supporting other newly built and existing industrial and mining enterprises. The workers active on the front lines of basic construction are also continuing to carry out many major construction projects with high labor enthusiasm, gradually strengthening our country's socialist material foundation.

Practicing strict economy is a fundamental method for completing socialist construction. In their work, workers resolutely implement the central government's policy of practicing strict economy, using the most economical and rapid methods to complete plans ahead of schedule, increase capital accumulation, and ensure the realization of socialist industrialization.

　　The Xing'antai vertical shaft project of the Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province is under full-scale construction. The Xing'antai vertical shaft project is the second pair of mechanized vertical shafts newly built by the mine after the Dongshan vertical shaft began construction. After these two vertical shafts are put into production, the annual production of industrial coal will be tens of thousands of tons more than that of the Dongshan vertical shaft.

　　Part of the construction project of my country's first tractor manufacturing plant has started. The engineering bureau undertaking the construction of this plant recently adopted many cost-reducing measures when revising this year's construction plan, saving more than 1.43 million yuan in this year's project cost compared with the construction budget originally approved by the state. The picture shows a corner of the tractor manufacturing plant construction site.
