　　Pay Attention to the Annotation of Classic Works
　　Weng Zusheng, Wang Zhiren
　　When studying classic theoretical works, beginners often encounter unfamiliar figures and events, etc., which require annotations to help them understand. However, the annotations in some books are too simple or incomplete, which not only fails to help readers but also increases ideological confusion.
　　There is an example in the upper volume of "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" published by the People's Publishing House. In Lenin's "The impending catastrophe and how to combat it," he wrote: "Therefore, all capitalists, all bourgeois professors, the entire bourgeoisie, and all the Plekhanovs who serve it..." Note 6 in this book says: "Plekhanov (1856-1918) was a great Marxist theorist, the founder of the first Russian Marxist group 'Emancipation of Labor', and he did a great deal of work in spreading Marxism in Russia." Lenin mentioned "Yedinstvo" newspaper in the same article. Note 9 in this book says: "Yedinstvo was a newspaper sponsored by Plekhanov (see Note 6), published in Petrograd in 1917. The newspaper conducted a frenzied agitation against the Bolsheviks and firmly advocated uniting with the Constitutional Democrats." This is really baffling: the text denies Plekhanov, while Note 6 affirms him, and Note 9 contradicts Note 6. In this book and some other books, the annotations for the names of Bogdanov, Bukharin, Martov and others often have similar situations.
　　Of course, it is impossible and unnecessary to introduce many figures and events, especially the more complex ones, in great detail in one annotation; however, it is possible and necessary to explain some of the important points. For example, when introducing Plekhanov, we believe that several key points should not be omitted: He was one of the pioneers of Russian Marxism. However, he later betrayed the working class and became a member of the Mensheviks. Lenin had a very high evaluation of many of Plekhanov's works, but Lenin also pointed out a series of major mistakes made by Plekhanov.
　　In short, regarding the annotations of figures and events in books, we believe that the annotations should first be aimed at the issues to be explained in the text, and the important points must not be omitted; as for how to comprehensively understand these figures and events, readers can be introduced to refer to other books. Only such annotations are welcomed by readers.

　　注意经典著作的注释工作
　　翁祖善　王之人
    学习经典的理论著作，初学者常常会碰到一些生疏的人物和事件等等，这就要借注释来帮助理解。但是，有些书的注释太简单或不全面，对于读者不仅没有帮助，反而增加了思想上的混乱。
    人民出版社出版的“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”上册中就有一个例子。列宁在“灾祸临头和防止之法”一文中写道：“所以一切资本家，一切资产阶级教授，整个资产阶级，以及所有替它服务的普列汉诺夫辈……”这本书的注释六说：“普列汉诺夫（一八五六—一九一八）是巨大的马克思主义理论家，俄国第一个马克思主义团体‘劳动解放’社底创始人，他在俄国传播马克思主义方面进行了很大的工作。”列宁在同一文中又提到“统一 报”。这本书的注释九却说：“统一报系普列汉诺夫主办的报纸（参阅注六），一九一七年出版于彼得格拉。该报曾进行疯狂鼓动反对布尔什维克，坚决主张与立宪民主党联合”。这真太叫人莫名其妙了：正文中对普列汉诺夫是否定的，注释六却是肯定的，注释九又同注释六发生矛盾。这本书和别的一些书中，对于波格达诺夫、布哈林和马尔托夫等人名的注释，也常有类似情况。
    当然有许多人物和事件，特别是比较复杂些的，要求在一个注释中介绍得十分详细是没有可能，也没有必要；但是，说明其中的几个重要关节还是可以而且是必要的。例如，介绍普列汉诺夫，我们以为有几个要点就不可遗漏：他是俄国马克思主义的首创者之一。但是，他后来背叛了工人阶级，成为孟什维克的一分子。列宁对于普列汉诺夫的许多著作评价很高，但是列宁也指出了普列汉诺夫一系列的重大错误。
    总之，关于书中人物和事件等等的注释，我们以为首先应该是针对正文所要说明的问题去注释，对于其重要的关节是决不可省略的；至于怎样全面地去认识这些人物和事件等等，可以介绍读者去参考另一些书籍。只有这样的注释才是为读者所欢迎的。
