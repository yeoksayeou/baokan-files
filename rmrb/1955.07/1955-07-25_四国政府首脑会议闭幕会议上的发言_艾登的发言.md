Mr. Chairman:

    We have now concluded the summit conference of the heads of government, a conference that has been so much discussed and so enthusiastically advocated by everyone—especially Sir Winston Churchill—more than two years ago. This conference has set itself a limited task, which has been very well accomplished.

    Ten years ago, the European war ended. Now, we have finally begun the work that we could have hoped to start in 1945. The agreement we have now reached makes it possible to seriously study the two inseparable issues of German reunification and European security.

    No one thinks that resolving every detail of these complex issues will be an easy matter. However, there is now a better opportunity than we have known at any time since the war to begin studying practical proposals to resolve the divisions that have been splitting Europe for years.

    At this conference, we have not undertaken to formulate a detailed plan in these short few days.

    Nevertheless, in our instructions to the foreign ministers, it can be found that we have included the key points for reaching a broad solution. The world has already seen the atmosphere and mood in which we conducted our work. Those of us who have engaged in actual negotiations have noted a new spirit of reconciliation that has been present in our meetings. But apart from this formal work, we have also had many opportunities for private contact, which we now also consider to be very valuable.

    I am fully convinced that these exchanges of views outside the conference room have enabled all of us to better understand each other's viewpoints and the problems that each party must face. If we can continue our work together in the spirit of this conference, then what appears today as a promising prospect should become a reliable reality as the situation develops.

    四国政府首脑会议闭幕会议上的发言
    艾登的发言主席先生：
    我们现在已经结束了政府首脑会议，这个会议是大家——特别是邱吉尔爵士在两年多以前——这样多地讨论到和这样热诚地倡议召开的。这个会议为它自己规定了一个有限度的任务，这个任务已经非常好地完成了。
    十年以前，欧洲战争结束了。现在，我们终于开始了我们本来可以希望可能在一九四五年开始的工作。我们现在已经取得的协议使得有可能认真研究德国统一和欧洲安全这两个不可分割的问题。
    没有人认为，解决这些复杂的问题的每一个细节会是一件容易的事。但是，现在有比战后任何时候我们所知道的更好的机会来开始研究切实可行的建议来解决这些年来一直分裂着欧洲的分歧。
    在这次会议上，我们没有在这短短的几天内着手拟定一个详细的计划。
    虽然如此，在我们在给外长们的指示中，还是可以发现我们已经列入了达成广泛解决的各项要点。全世界会已经看到我们进行工作的气氛和情绪。我们当中的进行了实际谈判的人们已经注意到在我们的会议上一直存在着一种新的和解精神。但是除开这种正式的工作以外，我们还得到了许多进行私人接触的机会，我们现在也认为这种接触是非常有价值的。
    我十分相信，在会议室外进行的这些意见交换，使得我们大家都能够更好地了解彼此的观点和各方必须面对的问题。如果我们能够本着这个会议的精神在一起继续进行我们的工作，那末，今天作为有希望的前景的东西应当能随着局势的发展而成为可靠的现实。
