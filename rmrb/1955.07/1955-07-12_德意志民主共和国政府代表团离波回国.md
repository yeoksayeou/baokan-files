Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 11th – According to a report by the Polish Press Agency: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, returned home on the 10th.

    Before the delegation departed, the people of Poznań held a farewell rally. Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz and Premier Grotewohl spoke at the meeting. They emphasized that Polish-German friendship is in line with the vital interests of the two peoples. The celebrations marking the fifth anniversary of the signing of the treaty demarcating the border once again demonstrated to the world that all attempts to sow discord between the two peoples are in vain, and that the fraternal and friendly ties between the two peoples in the struggle for peace are inseparable.

    Accompanied by Cyrankiewicz, Grotewohl and members of the German Democratic Republic delegation walked from the meeting to the station. The masses of Poznań people lining the streets warmly cheered them, shouting "Long live Polish-German friendship."

    据新华社华沙十一日电　据波兰通讯社报道：以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团十日回国。
    在代表团动身回国之前，波兹南人民举行了欢送大会。波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和格罗提渥总理在会上讲了话。他们着重指出，波德友好是符合两国人民切身利益的，两国人民为纪念划定国界的条约的签订五周年的庆祝活动再一次向全世界表明了：一切想在两国人民之间散布不和的企图是徒然的，两国人民在争取和平的斗争中的兄弟友好联系是紧密不可分的。
