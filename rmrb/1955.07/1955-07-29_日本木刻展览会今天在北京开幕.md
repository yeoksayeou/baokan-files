    Japanese Woodcut Exhibition Opens in Beijing Today

    (Our newspaper reports) The Japanese Woodcut Exhibition opened at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall on the 29th. This exhibition is sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association. A preview was held on the 28th, attended by artists in Beijing, Japanese peace advocates Ikuo Oyama, Ryuko Oyama, Togo Kameda, Uemon Nakamura, the head of the Japanese press and broadcasting delegation currently visiting China, Minoru Yokota, and some members of the delegation, as well as international peace advocates in Beijing such as W.N. Turelli, Huang Fengjiu, and others.

    The exhibition displays 153 Japanese woodcut works, totaling 222 pieces. Some of these works were sent to the Chinese Artists Association by the Japan Print Movement Association, and some were sent to the Chinese Artists Association and Chinese woodcut artists by woodcut artists from various parts of Japan over the past year. The majority of the exhibited works, such as "Accusation of Atomic Bomb Victims" (by Makoto Ueno), "The Disaster of American Hydrogen Bomb Testing" (by Koji Arai), "Desolate Fish Stall" (by Yoshio Murakami), "Sending Dad to Sea to Fish" (by Koji Arai), "At the US Military Base" (by Kenji Suzuribayashi), etc., reflect the current political struggles of the Japanese people to strive for peace, independence, and against aggression, the use of atomic weapons, and the American imperialist military occupation of Japan, reflecting the tragic life and heroic struggles of the Japanese people under American military occupation.

    The exhibited works also express the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. For example, "Talking About New China" (by Ichiro Oguchi) depicts the joyful mood of the Japanese people when talking about the achievements of New China. "Don't Forget Hanaoka" (a collaboration between Koji Arai and Niro Takihira) is a set of fifty-six woodcut serial pictures created to commemorate the Chinese prisoners of war who sacrificed their lives in the Hanaoka mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    The exhibition also includes some woodcuts depicting beautiful Japanese scenery and the customs of the Japanese people, as well as bookplates, calendar headings, New Year cards, decorative woodcuts, etc. These works have strong national characteristics in style and color. Such as Senpan Maekawa's "Landscape", "Firewood", Junichiro Sekino's "Bridge", "Bitcha", Koshiro Onchi's "Street", Shudo Shun's "Mantis" and so on.

    In addition, the exhibition also showcases some "craft woodblock prints" (fine art reproductions carefully engraved and printed by Japanese folk artists based on the original works of painters).

    日本木刻展览会今天在北京开幕
    本报讯　日本木刻展览会二十九日在北京美术展览馆开幕。这个展览会是中国美术家协会主办的。展览会在二十八日举行预展，在京美术家和日本和平人士大山郁夫、大山柳子、龟田东伍、中村玩右卫门，正在我国访问的日本新闻界广播界访华代表团团长横田实和部分团员，以及在北京的各国和平人士万徒勒里、黄凤九等都曾去参观。
    这个展览会展出的日本木刻作品有一百五十三件，共二百二十二幅。这些作品，一部分是日本版画运动协会寄给中国美术家协会的，一部分是一年来日本各地木刻家陆续寄给中国美术家协会和中国的木刻家的。展出的大部分作品，如“原子病害者的控诉”（上野诚作）、“美国试验氢弹的灾害”（新居广治作）、“冷落的鱼摊”（村上芳夫作）、“送爸爸出海打鱼”（新居广治作）、“在美军基地”（铃林贤二作）等，都反映了日本人民争取和平、争取独立、反对侵略、反对使用原子武器、反对美国帝国主义在日本的军事占领等当前的政治斗争，反映了在美国军事占领下日本人民的悲惨生活和英勇的斗争。
    展出的作品中也表现了中日两国人民的友谊。如“谈新中国”（小口一郎作），描写了日本人民谈着新中国的成就时那种欢欣鼓舞的心情。“不要忘记花冈”（新居广治、泷平二郎合作）是为纪念抗日战争期间牺牲在日本秋田县花冈矿山的中国战俘而创作的一套五十六幅的木刻连环画。
    展出作品中还有一些描绘优美的日本风景和日本人民风俗的木刻，以及藏书票、月历头、贺年片、装饰木刻等。这些作品在风格上、色彩上都有强烈的民族特点。如前川千帆的“风景”、“柴”，关野准一郎的“桥”、“备茶”，恩地孝四郎的“街头”，守洞春的“螳螂”等等。
    此外，展览会还展出了一些“工艺木版画”（日本民间艺人根据画家的原作精心刻制印刷而成的美术复制品）。
