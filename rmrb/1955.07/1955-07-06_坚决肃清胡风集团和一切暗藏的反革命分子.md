Resolutely Eliminate the Hu Feng Group and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Round Up All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
	Long Yun
    The three sets of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published by the "People's Daily" fully prove that Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng group are indeed loyal lackeys of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Hu Feng group is a counter-revolutionary organization with a program, plan, and strategy; and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group entrenched in Taiwan calls these anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng group "courageous and knowledgeable, worthy of praise." The matter is as clear as can be, the truth is completely revealed, and I don't think there will be any more confused people saying that the Hu Feng problem is a "matter of thought" and "a matter of the literary and art circles." Now we demand that the government severely punish the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group according to law, and thoroughly eliminate all hidden enemies to protect our acquired and future victories.
    In recent years, the construction of our great motherland has advanced by leaps and bounds, the people's democratic regime is very solid, and the national defense force is growing stronger. It is absolutely impossible for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to openly use force to destroy our people's revolutionary cause. However, the declining imperialism and the class that is about to die are by no means willing to fail, and will inevitably make a final desperate struggle. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, on the orders of their masters, vainly attempted to "use the tactic of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly" to make trouble from within the people. This shows the intensification and complication of the class struggle during the transition period. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been lurking in the revolutionary camp for more than 20 years, causing great losses to the country and the people. The exposure of their counter-revolutionary conspiracy this time is another major victory for the Chinese people's revolutionary cause under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must learn from the Hu Feng incident, raise our vigilance, improve our ideological level, and enhance our political acumen to round up all hidden counter-revolutionary elements and cleanse them all out. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can defeat all internal and external enemies and victoriously complete the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

	We Must Draw Profound Lessons from the Hu Feng Incident
	Jiang Guangnai
    The mask of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been torn off, and their ugly faces have been exposed to the light of day. This group of vicious enemies hidden in the revolutionary ranks, for more than 20 years, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and pretending to be "progressive," has actually used extremely insidious and cunning double-dealing tactics to carry out counter-revolutionary crimes in an organized, programmed, and planned manner. Their fundamental purpose is to attempt to subvert the people's regime, undermine socialist construction, and dream of putting the shackles of reactionary rule back on the necks of the Chinese people, once again cruelly exploiting and enslaving 600 million Chinese people.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is deeply hostile to the people and extremely resentful of the new social order. They want to "take the world as their responsibility" and consistently launch frantic attacks on the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolutionary cause led by the Party. Even when the people's revolutionary forces were in extremely difficult times, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was "full of optimism," hoping that Chiang Kai-shek could "defeat" the main force of the revolution in "three months" and "clean up" in "one year." But as the editor's note in the People's Daily pointed out: "The method they use to think about things is subjective and metaphysical, so their estimates are always wrong." The revolutionary forces have grown rapidly, and the great liberation war has advanced victoriously one after another. When Nanjing was about to be liberated, the people of the whole country were extremely excited and encouraged, while the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group felt great pressure under the revolutionary storm, wanting to "welcome suffering" and carry out counter-revolutionary activities more resolutely and more secretly. After the establishment of the powerful people's democratic dictatorship, they infiltrated various departments of the people's regime in various regions and from various aspects, and even infiltrated the Communist Party of China, fraudulently obtaining the glorious title of party member. Everywhere they "strived for people" and "contacted people," adopting the tactic of "digging the heart," abiding by their counter-revolutionary organizational principles, and carrying out "drip-by-drip struggle," "wanting to promote the actual situation from this step." When they "spied on the direction" and "aimed accurately," they vainly attempted to "cut off the head" to attack the people's revolutionary cause. However, the backward and decadent reactionaries are destined to perish. Although the internal discipline of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was very strict, the concealment was very clever, and the means were very cunning, they finally did not escape the giant palm of the people. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and after the unanimous exposure and denunciation of the people of the whole country, the dirty and stinky iron wall of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was shattered. The angered people will also thoroughly eliminate them and dig up all their old roots.
    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a major victory for the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people to carry out the great socialist construction. It also clearly shows that the class struggle during the transition period is even more complex and acute. The enemy is by no means willing to accept their failure, and will inevitably make a desperate struggle in various ways, attacking the Party, the people, and the revolution more frantically. Therefore, we must not only thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, but also take advantage of the victory to pursue and resolutely and thoroughly investigate all counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks and cleanse them out.
    In order to defend the people's democratic dictatorship and socialist construction, we must draw profound lessons from the Hu Feng incident, raise our political vigilance, overcome complacency, learn the ability to identify good people from bad people in various situations, and carry out resolute struggles against all hidden enemies. What is especially important is that we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party." "The theoretical basis guiding our ideology is Marxism-Leninism." We should deeply realize that any resistance to the leadership of the Party is a crime against the socialist cause; any weakening of Marxism-Leninism is to help the growth of bourgeois ideology and other reactionary class ideologies. Therefore, we must cherish the Party as we cherish our own eyes, earnestly accept the leadership of the Party, unite more closely, and work actively and diligently in accordance with the Party's line, principles, and policies. At the same time, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, gradually transform the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, overcome individualism and liberalism, and strengthen organization, discipline, unity, and centralization. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, whose consciousness is increasing day by day and whose unity is becoming more and more consolidated, will surely overcome all obstacles and difficulties and build a great socialist society; any enemy's attempt will inevitably be thoroughly bankrupt.

	Resolutely Suppress All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
	Yi Meihou
    After the "People's Daily" published the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, the people of the whole country recognized that Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group were originally a gang of double-dealing schemers wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and secretly engaging in anti-Communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary criminal activities. Then, the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, which more clearly revealed the true faces of these schemers and confirmed that this group of schemers, who have been mixed in the revolutionary ranks for more than 20 years and tried their best to carry out organized, programmed, and planned sabotage activities, are precisely the loyal lackeys of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. They showed deep hatred for the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary forces, always adhered to their counter-revolutionary stance, and dreamed of the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. They, like all kinds of secret agents and spies we have cracked down on over the years, are the most vicious enemies of the Chinese people, and their methods are even more vicious, cunning, and despicable.
    As the "People's Daily" editorial pointed out, we must learn from the Hu Feng incident, redouble our vigilance, always maintain a clear head, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, improve our political acumen, distinguish between right and wrong, so that we can expose and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Today, we must thoroughly smash the Hu Feng group and remove this group of counter-revolutionary elements.
    I am a representative of the National People's Congress and also a returned overseas Chinese. I understand that the victory of the revolution did not come easily. In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, I fully support the denunciation of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group by democratic parties and people's organizations throughout the country in recent days, and demand that Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group be severely punished according to law! All hidden counter-revolutionary elements must be ruthlessly exposed and resolutely suppressed!

	Clearing All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements Is the Task of All Members of the Entire Revolutionary Ranks
	Qian Changzhao
    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a great lesson for the people of the whole country. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group infiltrated government agencies, trade unions, and even the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. There is no doubt that they must have also infiltrated people's organizations and democratic parties.
    As a member of a democratic party, I think that every democratic party must strive to do the following: First, every member of a democratic party, if they are directly related to the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, or indirectly related to it, must immediately confess and tell everything, without allowing any concealment; second, every member of a democratic party, if they have been directly related to other hidden counter-revolutionary groups or counter-revolutionary elements, or indirectly related to them, must immediately confess frankly and tell everything, without allowing any concealment; third, we must pay attention to those who are dissatisfied with the Communist Party and the People's Government, because those people are most likely to embark on the road of counter-revolution; fourth, we must educate those who have individualism and liberalism, because those people are the best targets for counter-revolutionary groups or counter-revolutionary elements to deceive and exploit.
    After the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was exposed, some people still have some misconceptions and some doubts, which must be clarified.
    Some people say: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been active for so long, why was it not exposed until today? Could it be that they committed some ideological mistakes in the past, and now they have become more serious, so they should be punished. This view is incorrect. Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have long been inextricably linked with Kuomintang agents: Hu Feng himself did anti-communist political work in the Jiangxi "剿共" army; A Long served as a major military instructor under the command of Hu bandit Zongnan and was trained in the Chongqing mountain cave; Lü Yuan even served as a special agent in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." These are all ironclad evidence, and if we continue to dig, there will be more than this. There is no doubt that the Hu Feng group is an insidious, vicious, and long-hidden counter-revolutionary organization. After liberation, the people's regime protected the confidentiality of communications, but they communicated extensively, insulting leaders, insulting the Communist Party, and insulting the people; after liberation, the people's regime guaranteed freedom of speech, but they published fallacies everywhere, wantonly slandering and scolding many revolutionaries and democrats. Good! Now this counter-revolutionary group has been confirmed, and after confirmation, the next step is suppression. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is something that the people's regime must do, and it is also the general demand of the broad masses of the people.
    Some people say: Hu Feng has already made a self-criticism, bowed his head to the people, literati cannot rebel, and individual education is enough. This view is extremely wrong. The methods of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are diverse, and they have been deceiving the people for so long, so of course they have a set of skills. Disintegrate into parts, retreat to advance, be "calm" when it is time to be "calm," "endure" when it is time to "endure," "play dead" when it is time to "play dead," all for their "cause," for their "grand future." The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group must have their masters, and the Chiang Kai-shek fascist Kuomintang is their master, which has been confirmed.
    Some people say: Suppressing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, at a time when national construction is busy, it seems that it is not necessary to make a big fanfare. This view is also completely wrong. This time we will not only eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, but also eliminate all lurking counter-revolutionary groups and counter-revolutionary elements. It can be asserted that in mainland China, there is more than one counter-revolutionary group besides Hu Feng, and there is more than one group of counter-revolutionary elements besides Hu Feng. There are now, and there will be in the future. In short, before imperialism and its running dogs have not been completely eliminated on the earth, counter-revolutionary groups and counter-revolutionary elements will not disappear in socialist countries and people's democratic countries. The stronger our country is, the more eager the counter-revolutionaries will be to sabotage. This is a long-term struggle, and this is an extremely sharp struggle. The louder the alarm bells ring, the clearer our minds will be, and the counter-revolutionary groups and counter-revolutionary elements will have no gaps to take advantage of and no place to hide. Therefore, it is very necessary to suppress counter-revolutionaries with great fanfare. The broad revolutionary people should participate in this movement and carefully analyze the facts and seriously learn lessons in this movement. Studying Marxism-Leninism, improving our political level, and strengthening our ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary groups and counter-revolutionary elements are our future efforts.
    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a major event, and the materials are extremely rich. From this, we can see that we were not vigilant enough in the past, and from this, we can see that our inspection of counter-revolutionary events was not strict enough in the past. Improving political vigilance and eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, as the "People's Daily" editorial said: "It is the task of all members of the entire revolutionary ranks." (Originally published in "Ta Kung Pao")

	Severely Punish Hidden Enemies
	Liang Sicheng
    I am a patient, and for more than half a year, I have been fighting a long-term battle against illness. I read with incomparable anger the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th and 24th. On June 10th, the third batch of materials was published again. I tried to restrain myself, to rest and recuperate in peace, in order to recover my health as soon as possible, but I could not suppress my anger at this counter-revolutionary group.
    Batch after batch of materials prove that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been lurking in the people's democratic united front in a planned and organized way, carrying out their criminal activities. On the surface, they pretend to "follow" the Party and the people, but secretly "use the tactic of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly" to "penetrate into" our "liver." Such insidious, despicable, and vicious elements, just like bacteria invading our body, have invaded our revolutionary ranks, and even infiltrated the Communist Party of China. We must expose these lurking counter-revolutionary elements and fight against them, just as a patient must fight against vicious bacteria. As the "People's Daily" editorial pointed out: "We must resolutely remove them. Otherwise, they will spread, expand their numbers, damage our bodies, and cause serious losses to our cause."
    Now, the Hu Feng group's problem is no longer just a problem of literary and artistic thought. What we are asking for is not just to expel Hu Feng and Hu Feng elements from various positions in the Chinese Writers Association and the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Nor is it just to demand the revocation of Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress. What we are asking for is the severe and merciless suppression of a counter-revolutionary black gang. Hu Feng elements are the real "pus," "if you don't do it, don't stop." Now is the time for our people to perform surgery.
    Hu Feng and all unrepentant Hu Feng elements must be severely punished by law. We cannot be "polite" to insidious, hidden enemies!
    We must raise our vigilance, arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, strictly guard against the sabotage of class enemies, and defend our great socialist construction.

	Educators Should Actively Participate in the Struggle to Eliminate the Hu Feng Group and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
	Xu Chongqing
    The "Southern Daily" on June 19th exposed the criminal activities of Zhu Guhuai, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Guangzhou. This exposure, as the "Southern Daily" editorial pointed out: "Is a wake-up call for the people of South China, and this wake-up call clearly tells us: We must never think that there are no Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group members and other hidden counter-revolutionary elements here!"
    Because Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong and Macau, the American aggressive group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group are constantly trying to send secret agents and bandits into our interior. In fact, according to the situation revealed by some schools in Guangzhou, hidden counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated our schools. After the struggle to criticize Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thought was launched in some universities in Guangzhou, some teachers who attached importance to and actively participated in the struggle would receive anonymous threatening letters. Doesn't this just show that the black hands of the counter-revolution are reaching out to our sides? The enemy is not only in that very, very far place, but also carrying out activities around us. Now, the exposure of Zhu Guhuai, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, proves this point. Therefore, we must not be paralyzed or careless!
    The criminal activities of Zhu Guhuai, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Guangzhou, once again show that: The reason why this kind of secret agent and bandit gang is different from general counter-revolutionary groups is that its followers are from intellectual backgrounds, and they are hidden in the cultural circles, hanging a revolutionary signboard to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. It is not a general secret agent who kills, sets fires, and poisons, but the most poisonous counter-revolutionary element who kills without seeing blood. Therefore, it is very cruel, very insidious, and very vicious. At the same time, it has been lurking in the people's interior for a long time, so that many people, especially many intellectuals, have been deceived and deceived by it.
    Therefore, in front of our educators, in front of all intellectuals, there is a serious task of political struggle: We must thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. This is a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. This is a serious struggle to defend our revolutionary achievements and defend the socialist cause of our motherland.
    However, until now, haven't some people still doubted and said: "The Hu Feng group has no knives and no guns, how can they be said to be counter-revolutionary elements?" Haven't some people said: "The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been exposed, is the movement about to end?" And aren't there still many people holding a "none of my business, hang high" attitude?
    These situations show that many of us lack a clear understanding of the sharpness and complexity of the current class struggle; we are even more insufficient in our understanding of the harmfulness of the enemy's pretense of progress, long-term lurking, and use of double-dealing tactics to sabotage from within.
    Of course, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group must be punished according to law, but we must also thoroughly investigate all hidden Hu Feng elements and other counter-revolutionary elements. The struggle has not ended, but is advancing in depth. The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution must continue to be strengthened until the classes are eliminated and all exploitation systems are eliminated. Therefore, every educator should actively participate in this struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and first of all, should seriously and carefully read the "People's Daily" editorials, editor's notes, and materials related to the Hu Feng incident, and conduct discussions in connection with ideological realities, eliminate the influence of Hu Feng's reactionary thoughts on teaching and ideology, so as to raise vigilance and learn the ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements. Only when we have drawn a clear line between ourselves and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group not only politically but also ideologically can we better expose all hidden counter-revolutionary elements in our positions.
    Finally, we want to seriously warn Hu Feng group members and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements that they must be honest and thoroughly confess and start a new life. If they are still evasive and continue to play double-dealing tactics, trying to avoid the limelight, then the broad masses of the people who have raised their vigilance will surely find them out and resolutely suppress them!

　　坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    把暗藏的反革命分子一网打尽
　　龙云
    “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料完全证明：胡风和胡风集团的许多骨干分子千真万确的是帝国主义和蒋匪帮的忠实走狗，胡风集团是一个有纲领、有计划、有战略的反革命组织；而盘踞在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团对胡风集团这些反党、反人民、反革命的罪行，称为是“有胆有识，值得赞扬”的。事情是再清楚没有了，真相完全大白了，我想不会再有糊涂人说什么胡风问题是“思想问题”和“文艺界的事”了。现在我们要求政府依法严惩胡风反革命集团，并彻底肃清一切暗藏的敌人，保卫我们已取得的和将要取得的胜利果实。
    这几年来，我们伟大祖国的建设事业突飞猛进，人民民主政权十分巩固，国防力量日益强大，美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮要想公开地用武力来破坏我们人民革命事业是万万不能了。但是没落的帝国主义和将要死亡的阶级决不甘心失败，必然要作最后的垂死挣扎。胡风反革命集团奉他们的主子之命，妄想“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，从人民内部来捣乱，这就说明了过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化。胡风反革命集团二十多年来潜藏在革命阵营里，给国家人民带来了很大的损失。这次他们反革命阴谋的被揭露，是中国人民革命事业在共产党的领导下又一次获得的重大胜利。我们必须从胡风事件吸取教训，提高警惕，提高思想水平，提高政治嗅觉，把一切暗藏反革命分子一网打尽，全部清洗出去。我坚决相信，在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，我们可以战胜一切内外敌人，胜利地完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业。
　　我们必须从胡风事件中吸取深刻的教训
　　蒋光鼐
    胡风反革命集团的假面具，已经撕下来了，他们丑恶的嘴脸，已经暴露在光天化日之下了。这伙暗藏在革命队伍中的恶毒敌人，二十多年来，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，装扮成一副“进步”面孔，实际上却采用极其阴险狡猾的两面派手法，有组织、有纲领、有计划地干着反革命的罪恶勾当。他们的根本目的，是企图颠覆人民政权，破坏社会主义建设，梦想把反动统治的枷锁重新套在中国人民的脖子上，再度残酷地剥削和奴役六亿中国人民。
    胡风反革命集团对于人民是刻骨仇视的，对于新的社会秩序是极端憎恨的。他们要“以天下为己任”，一贯地向中国共产党和党领导的人民革命事业疯狂地进攻。还在人民革命力量处在极其困难的时期，胡风反革命集团“充满了乐观”，指望蒋介石“三个月可以击破”革命的主力，“一年肃清”。但是正如人民日报编者按语指出的：“他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。”革命的力量飞速壮大起来了，伟大的解放战争一个胜利接着一个胜利地向前推进了。当着南京即将解放的时候，全国人民都异常兴奋鼓舞，而胡风反革命集团在革命的风暴下，感到极大的压力，要“迎接苦难”，更坚决、更隐蔽地进行反革命活动。在强大的人民民主专政建立起来以后，他们在各个地区，从各方面混进了人民政权的各个部门，甚至混进中国共产党党内，骗取得党员的光荣称号。到处“争取人”“联络人”，采用
  “挖心战”的战术，遵守着他们反革命的组织原则，进行着“点滴斗争”，“想从这一步去推动实际的局势”。在他们“窥测方向”“看准了的时候”，便妄图“割下头颅”来进攻人民革命事业。但是，落后的、腐朽的反动派，是注定要灭亡的。尽管胡风反革命集团的内部纪律很森严，隐蔽很巧妙，手段很狡猾，他们终于没有逃出人民的巨掌。在中国共产党英明正确的领导下，经过全国人民一致的揭露和声讨，胡风反革命集团脏臭的铁壁被击碎了。愤怒了的人民也一定要彻底肃清他们，挖尽他们的老根。
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露，是中国共产党领导中国人民进行伟大的社会主义建设的一次重大胜利。也同时鲜明地说明了过渡时期阶级斗争的更加复杂和尖锐。敌人决不甘心他们的失败，必然要以各种方式，作垂死的挣扎，更加疯狂地向党、人民和革命进攻。因此，我们不仅要彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，而且，要乘胜追击，坚决、彻底地清查一切暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子，把他们清洗出去。
    为了保卫人民民主专政，保卫社会主义建设，我们必须从胡风事件中吸取深刻的教训，提高政治警惕，克服太平观念，学会在各种情况下识别好人和坏人的本领，同一切暗藏的敌人进行坚决的斗争。尤其重要的是，必须随时记着毛主席的教导：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”我们应深刻地认识到，任何对党的领导的抗拒，就是对社会主义事业的犯罪；任何对马克思列宁主义的削弱，就是助长资产阶级思想和其他反动阶级思想。因此，我们要像爱护自己的眼睛一样来爱护党，切实接受党的领导，更紧密地团结一致，按照党的路线、方针和政策，积极努力地工作。同时，我们必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，逐步改造资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，克服个人主义、自由主义思想，加强组织性、纪律性、统一性、集中性。我们坚决相信在光荣的、伟大的、正确的中国共产党领导下，觉悟日益提高，团结更加巩固的中国人民，一定能排除一切障碍和困难，建成伟大的社会主义社会；任何敌人的任何企图，必然要遭到彻底的破产。
　　坚决镇压一切暗藏的反革命分子
　　蚁美厚
      “人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二批材料后，全国人民认清了胡风及其反革命集团原来是一伙披着马克思列宁主义外衣，暗中进行着反共、反人民、反革命罪恶活动的两面派阴谋家。接着，“人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，这批材料更清楚地揭露了这些阴谋家的真面目，证实这批二十多年来混在革命队伍里千方百计进行有组织、有纲领、有计划的破坏活动的阴谋家，正是帝国主义、蒋介石残余匪帮的忠实走狗。他们对中国共产党、中国人民和革命力量表现了刻骨的仇恨，始终坚持其反革命立场，梦想蒋介石残余匪帮的复辟。他们同我们历年来所破获的形形色色的特务间谍分子一样是中国人民最恶毒的敌人，而他们的手段又是更加毒辣、狡猾和卑鄙的。
    正如“人民日报”社论所指出的，我们必须从胡风事件吸取教训，加倍提高警惕，经常保持清醒头脑，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高政治嗅觉，识别是非真伪，才能揭发、清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，今天更要彻底粉碎胡风集团，把这批反革命分子清除出去。
    我是全国人民代表大会的代表，也是一个归国华侨。我懂得革命胜利得来不易。为了保卫祖国社会主义建设，我完全拥护近日来全国各地各民主党派、各人民团体对胡风反革命集团的声讨，要求依法严惩胡风及其反革命集团！对一切暗藏的反革命分子必须无情地揭发出来，坚决予以镇压！
　　清除一切暗藏的反革命分子是整个革命队伍一切成员的任务
　　钱昌照
    胡风反革命集团的揭发，对全国人民来说，是个很大的教训。胡风反革命集团混进了政府机关，混进了工会，甚至混进了中国共产党的队伍。毫无疑义，他们必然也混进了人民团体和民主党派。
    作为民主党派成员之一，我认为每个民主党派必须努力做到以下几件事：一、每个民主党派的成员，要是同胡风反革命集团直接有关系，或是间接发生过关系，必须立刻交代，而且要和盘托出，不容许丝毫隐瞒；二、每个民主党派的成员，要是同其他暗藏的反革命集团或反革命分子直接有过关系，或是间接发生过关系，必须立刻坦白，而且要和盘托出，不容许丝毫隐瞒；三、我们要注意那些对共产党和人民政府不满的人，因为那些人最容易走上反革命的道路；四、我们要教育那些有个人主义和自由主义的人，因为那些人是反革命集团或反革命分子欺骗利用的最好对象。
    胡风反革命集团被揭发以后，某些人还有一些错觉，一些怀疑，必须解释清楚。
    有人说：胡风反革命集团活动了那么久，为何迟至今日方才揭发，莫非他们过去犯的是一些思想上的错误，现在变本加厉，所以要加以制裁。这种看法是不正确的。胡风和胡风反革命集团许多骨干分子，早已同国民党特务结下不解缘：胡风本人在江西“剿共”军中做过反共的政治工作；阿垅在胡匪宗南手下当过少校军事教官，并在重庆山洞受过训；绿原还在“中美合作所”当特务。这些都是铁证，继续挖掘，铁证决不止此。毫无疑义，胡风集团是个阴险、恶毒、潜伏已久的反革命组织。解放后人民政权保护通信秘密，他们却大通其信，侮辱领导，侮辱共产党，侮辱人民；解放后，人民政权保证言论自由，他们却到处发表谬论，对许多革命者和民主人士肆意诬蔑、谩骂。好！现在这个反革命集团被证实了，证实以后接下去就是镇压。镇压反革命是人民政权必须做的事，也是广大群众的普遍的要求。
    有人说：胡风已经作了检讨，向人民低了头，文人造不了反，个别地教育教育也就够了。这种看法是极端错误的。胡风反革命集团的手法，多种多样，他们欺骗人民那么久，当然有他们的一套本领。化整为零，以退为进，当“冷静”的时候“冷静”，当“忍受”的时候“忍受”，当“装死”的时候“装死”，一切无非为了他们的“事业”，为了他们的“远大的未来”。胡风反革命集团必然有他们的主子，蒋介石法西斯国民党是他们的主子，乃是证实了的。
    有人说：镇压胡风反革命集团，在国家建设繁忙之际，似乎可以不必大张旗鼓。这种看法，又是大错而特错了。这一次我们不但要清除胡风反革命集团，也还要清除所有潜伏着的反革命集团和反革命分子。可以断言：在中国大陆，反革命集团不止胡风这一个，反革命分子也不止胡风这一批，现在有，将来还会有，总之，帝国主义及其走狗在地球上尚未被完全消灭干净时，反革命集团和反革命分子在社会主义国家和人民民主国家里是不会绝迹的。我们的国家愈强大，反革命的破坏也一定愈急切。这是长时期的斗争，这是极其尖锐的斗争。警钟敲得愈响，我们的头脑愈清醒，反革命集团和反革命分子也就无隙可乘，无地可容。因此，大张旗鼓地镇压反革命是十分必要的。广大的革命人民都应该参加这一运动，并在这一运动中详细分析事实，认真接受教训。学习马克思列宁主义，提高政治水准，加强我们对反革命集团和反革命分子的辨别能力，是我们今后的努力方向。
    胡风反革命集团的揭发，是件大事，材料极其丰富。从这里可以看出我们过去不够警惕，从这里可以看出我们过去对反革命事件的检查不够严密。提高政治警惕性，清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，正如“人民日报”社论所说：是“整个革命队伍一切成员的任务”。　（原载“大公报”）
　　严厉制裁暗藏的敌人
　　梁思成
    我是一个病人，半年多以来，我在同疾病作长期的斗争。我以无比愤怒的心情阅读了五月十三日和二十四日“人民日报”所发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第一批和第二批材料。六月十日，又发表了第三批材料。我企图抑制住自己，要安心静养，以期早日恢复健康，但是我无法按捺住自己对这个反革命集团的愤怒。
    一批又一批的材料证明胡风反革命集团一直是有计划、有组织地潜伏在人民民主统一战线内部，进行他们的罪恶活动。表面上伪装“顺着”党和人民，暗地里“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，要
  “深入到”我们的“肝脏里面去”。这样阴险、卑鄙、恶毒的分子，正如同细菌侵袭我们的身体一样，侵袭了我们的革命队伍，乃至混入了中国共产党。我们必须揭发这些潜伏的反革命分子，对他们进行斗争，如同一个病人必须同恶毒的细菌斗争一样。正如“人民日报”社论所指出：“必须坚决地把他们清除出去。否则，他们就会蔓延起来，扩大他们的人数，损害我们的肌体，使我们的事业遭到严重的损失。”
    现在，胡风集团的问题已经不仅仅是文艺思想的问题了，我们所要求的也不仅仅是从中国作家协会、中国文联各种职位上驱除胡风和胡风分子的问题了。也不仅仅是要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表资格。我们所要求的是对于一个反革命黑帮的严厉无情的镇压。胡风分子是真正的“脓”，“一不做，二不休”，现在是该我们人民开刀的时候了。
    胡风和一切怙恶不悛的胡风分子必须得到严厉的法律制裁。我们对于阴险的、暗藏的敌人是不能“客气”的！
    我们必须提高警惕，以马克思列宁主义武装起来，严防阶级敌人的破坏，保卫我们伟大的社会主义建设。
　　教育工作者应积极参加肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争
　　许崇清
    六月十九日“南方日报”揭发了在广州的胡风反革命集团骨干分子朱谷怀的罪恶活动。这个揭发，正如“南方日报”的社论所指出的：“对我们华南人民群众是一响清醒头脑的警钟，这响警钟明明白白地告诉我们：决不能以为我们这里就没有胡风反革命集团分子和其他暗藏的反革命分子！”
    由于广州接近香港、澳门，美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团无时无刻不在千方百计地派遣特务匪徒钻进我们的内部来。事实上，根据目前广州市的一些学校所揭露的情况看来，暗藏的反革命分子已经混进我们的学校来了。批判胡适派资产阶级唯心主义思想这一斗争在广州市的一些高等学校开展以后，一些重视并且积极参加斗争的教师，有的就会接到匿名的恐吓信。这不正是说明：反革命的黑手正伸向我们的身边吗？敌人不只在那很远很远的地方，而且就在我们自己的周围进行活动。现在，胡风反革命集团骨干分子朱谷怀的被揭发，证明了这一点。因此，我们千万麻痹不得，大意不得！
    在广州的胡风反革命集团骨干分子朱谷怀的罪恶活动，再一次说明了：这种特务匪帮所以和一般反革命集团不同，就是因为它的党羽是知识分子出身，而又隐藏在文化界中间挂着革命的幌子来干反革命的勾当的。它不是一般干杀人、放火、放毒这一类的特务，而是杀人不见血的最毒辣的反革命分子。因此，它是非常凶残、非常阴险、 非常恶毒 的。同时它长期潜伏在人民内部，使好些人，特别是好些知识分子受它的蒙蔽和欺骗。
    因此，在我们教育工作者面前，在一切知识分子面前，就摆着一个严重的政治斗争的任务：必须彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。这是一场革命对反革命的斗争。这是为了保卫我们的革命果实，保卫我们祖国社会主义事业的严重斗争。
    但是，直到现在，不是有一些人还怀疑说：“胡风集团没刀没枪，怎么能说是反革命分子？”不是有一些人说：“胡风反革命集团揭发了，运动快结束了吧？”并且不是还有不少人抱着“事不关己，高高挂起”的态度吗？
    这些情况，说明我们的许多人对于当前阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性缺乏明确的认识；对于敌人伪装进步，长期潜伏，使用两面派手法，从内部来破坏的危害性，更是认识不足的。
    当然，胡风反革命集团，必须依法惩处，但我们还必须彻底清查一切暗藏的胡风分子和其他反革命分子。斗争并没有结束，而是向纵深突进。革命对反革命的斗争必须继续加强，一直到消灭了阶级，消灭了一切剥削制度而后止。因此，我们每一个教育工作者都应该积极参加这一场革命对反革命的斗争，首先应该认真地、仔细地阅读“人民日报”有关胡风事件的社论、编者按语和材料，并且联系思想实际进行讨论，肃清胡风反动思想在教学上、思想上的影响，从而提高警惕，学会辨别反革命分子的本领。也只有当我们不单在政治上，而且在思想上同胡风反革命集团划清界限以后，我们才能够更好地在本岗位上揭发一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    最后，我们要严重警告胡风集团分子和一切暗藏的反革命分子，必须老老实实，彻底交代，重新做人。如果还躲躲闪闪，继续玩弄两面派的手法，企图避过风头，那末，提高了警惕的广大人民群众，是一定要把他们清查出来，坚决加以镇压的！
