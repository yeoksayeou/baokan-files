Xinhua News Agency, July 9th—Today was the second day of group discussions at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. Representatives in various groups have generally entered the industrial part of reading and discussing the draft First Five-Year Plan, and some have even begun reading the agricultural part.

　　The representatives in each group are extremely serious in their reading and discussion. They carefully read the documents, raised questions from all aspects, and listened attentively to the answers from responsible personnel sent by the State Council. Some representative groups did not hold discussion meetings in the afternoon, but the representatives still studied the documents separately. Some representatives, limited by their educational level and facing difficulties in reading the documents—including many model workers in industry and agriculture and combat heroes from the military—began today to listen to the explanations of important issues in the draft Five-Year Plan by responsible personnel sent by the State Council.

　　In the group discussions yesterday and today, the representatives paid attention to expressing their opinions in connection with their own work and regional characteristics. Some representatives from the Heilongjiang Province representative group focused on the issue of reducing non-productive construction standards mentioned in the draft Five-Year Plan, believing that reducing the construction cost of housing would save construction funds and prevent rents from being too high, which would be welcomed by the majority of workers and staff. The representative groups from Anhui Province and Fujian Province launched discussions on issues such as saving industrial raw materials and opening up sources of raw materials. Some representatives also commented on the issue of industrial raw materials in connection with what they learned during their recent inspections of work in various places. The Overseas Chinese representative group discussed the amount of agricultural investment and the participation of returned Overseas Chinese in industrial and agricultural production. The Sichuan Province representative group mentioned the balance between timber harvesting and processing industries in the discussion. Some representatives from the Shanxi Province representative group said that half of all cultivated land in Shanxi Province can be cultivated using tractors, but tractors will only be available after heavy industry is developed, and agricultural production can be greatly developed only then. Some representatives said that Shanxi Province currently has more than 31,000 agricultural production cooperatives, which need a large number of accountants and agricultural technicians. The speaking representatives believed that it is very important to train technical talents and various construction cadres.

　　In today's group discussions, some representative groups also considered the issue of preparing proposals.

　　Tomorrow is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day according to the meeting schedule. Group discussions will continue on the 11th.

　　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议
  　继续分组讨论五年计划草案
    新华社九日讯　今天是第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议分组讨论的第二天，各代表小组阅读和讨论第一个五年计划草案已普遍进入工业部分，有的并且开始阅读农业部分。
    各小组的代表们在阅读和讨论时，都极其认真。他们仔细地阅读文件，从各方面提出问题，并且全神贯注地听取国务院派来的负责工作人员的解答。有些代表小组下午没有举行讨论会，但代表们仍然分头钻研文件。一部分由于文化水平的限制，阅读文件有困难的代表——其中包括许多工农业劳动模范和部队战斗英雄，从今天开始听取国务院派来的负责工作人员对五年计划草案中重要问题的讲解。
    在昨天和今天的分组讨论中，代表们注意联系自己的工作和地区特点发表意见。黑龙江省代表小组有的代表在发言中着重谈到五年计划草案中提到的降低非生产性建设标准的问题，认为降低了住宅的建筑造价，既可节省建设资金，房租又不致过高，必将受到广大职工的欢迎。安徽省和福建省的代表小组就节约工业原料和开辟原料来源等问题，展开了讨论。有的代表并联系到不久前视察各地工作时所了解的情况，对工业原料问题发表了意见。华侨代表小组讨论了农业投资的数量和归国华侨参加工农业生产的问题。四川省代表小组在讨论中提到了木材采伐和加工工业的平衡问题。山西省代表小组有的代表说，山西省的全部耕地有一半可以使用拖拉机耕种，但只有发展重工业之后，才有拖拉机，也才能使农业生产得到大大的发展。有的代表说，山西省现有三万一千多个农业生产合作社，需要大批会计和农业技术人员。发言的代表认为培养技术人材和各种建设干部十分重要。
    在今天的分组讨论中，有些代表小组还联系到准备提案的问题。
    明天是星期日，按照会议日程休会一天。分组讨论将在十一日继续进行。
