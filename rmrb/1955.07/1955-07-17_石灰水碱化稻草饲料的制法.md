    Method of Making Straw Fodder Alkalized with Lime Water

    After this newspaper published an article titled "Taicang Promotes Straw Fodder Alkalized with Lime Water" on page two on May 27, we received many letters from readers requesting this newspaper to introduce the method of making straw alkalized with lime water in detail. The method that our Nanjing reporter station learned from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is introduced below:

    There are two methods for making straw fodder alkalized with lime water:

    The first method is: First, tie the straw into small bundles about the size of a rice bowl (nowadays, farmers generally use the straw of indica rice, japonica rice, and glutinous rice. According to research by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, wheat stalks, wheat husks, cotton husks, rice husks, etc. can also be used), and put them into a vat. Then add the soaked lime water (about six catties of quicklime or ten catties of slaked lime per hundred catties of straw) until it submerges the straw (Note: According to advanced Soviet experience, add three kilograms of quicklime or nine kilograms of lime powder per quintal of straw, using three hundred liters of water). The straw should be pressed with stones to prevent it from floating. After soaking for one day and one night, turn the straw into another vat, and pour the original lime water into it as well (if it cannot submerge the straw, add some more clean water), and the straw should still be pressed with stones. After another day and night (in cold weather, it can be soaked for one more day), take out the straw, chop it finely (generally into five to eight fen pieces), mix it with 50% concentrated feed, and it can be used to feed pigs.

    The second method is: First tie the straw into small bundles, soften them by hammering, chop them finely (about two or three fen pieces), and put them into a vat. Add lime water (same ratio as before), soak for one day and one night, and stir two or three times. Then wash the straw clean, add 40% rice bran, boil it, and then simmer for one or two hours, and it can be used to feed pigs.

    Of the above two methods, the first method is simpler. However, the second method has three shortcomings: First, it takes too much time. It takes more than an hour every day to raise one large pig and one small pig; second, it is not easy to wash the straw after it is chopped finely and then alkalized with lime; third, it uses a lot of fuel when cooking the straw, but it does not add much nutritional value.

    At present, most farmers in Taicang County use lime-alkalized straw mixed with rice bran, without mixing in some green grass and salt (according to Soviet experience, half a catty of salt can be used per dan of grass), which is a shortcoming. Because straw contains less vitamins and protein, adding green grass can make up for this shortcoming; adding salt can strengthen the pig, increase the pig's stomach acid, and prevent piglets from developing constipation after eating it.

    Lime-alkalized straw is best for feeding crossbred pigs, as it will make the pig's bones grow quickly and become thicker, and the pig will grow faster. If lime-alkalized straw is used to feed sows in the second half of pregnancy and lactating sows, as well as newly weaned piglets and fattening pigs that are about to leave the pen, some concentrated feed and green grass must be added, otherwise the pigs will not grow well.

### 石灰水碱化稻草饲料的制法

    石灰水碱化稻草饲料的制法
    五月二十七日本报第二版发表了“太仓推广石灰水碱化稻草饲料”一文以后，我们收到了不少读者来信，要求本报详细介绍石灰水碱化稻草的制法。现将本报南京记者站向江苏省农林厅了解的办法介绍于下：
    石灰水碱化稻草饲料有两种制法：
    第一种制法是：先把稻草扎成像饭碗口大的小把子（现在一般农民用的是籼稻、粳稻、糯稻的稻草，据江苏省农林厅研究，麦秆、麦壳、棉壳、谷壳等都可利用），放进缸里。再加进泡好的石灰水（每百斤稻草用六斤左右生石灰或十斤左右熟石灰），加到淹没稻草为止（按：根据苏联先进经验，每公担稻草加三公斤生石灰或九公斤石灰粉，用三百公升的水）。稻草上应压上石块，不让它浮起来。浸一昼夜以后，将稻草翻到另一个缸里，再将原来的石灰水也倒进去（如不能浸没稻草，再加上一些清水），草上仍压上石块。再过一昼夜（天气阴冷时可多浸一天）后，将草拿出，铡细（一般在五分至八分），拌和百分之五十的精料，就可以喂猪了。
    第二种制法是：先将稻草分扎成小把子，捶软，铡细（约二、三分），放进缸里。加上石灰水（比例同前），浸一昼夜时间，搅拌两三次。然后把稻草洗干净，加上百分之四十的清糠，煮沸后再闷一、二小时，就可以喂猪。
    以上两种制法，第一种方法较简便。而第二种制法却有三个缺点：一、费时太多，养一头大猪和一头小猪，每天要花费一小时以上；二、草先铡细，后用石灰碱化，不容易洗；三、煮草时用的燃料多，但并不增加很多营养价值。
    目前太仓县农民大部分是用石灰碱化稻草拌清糠，没有拌上一些青草和食盐（根据苏联经验每担草可用食盐半斤），这是一个缺点。因为稻草中含维他命和蛋白质较少，加青草就可以弥补这个缺点；加盐可以壮膘，又可以增加猪的胃酸，以免猪仔食后发生便秘。
    石灰水碱化稻草喂克郎猪最好，会使猪的骨骼迅速粗大，长得也比较快。如用石灰水碱化稻草喂怀孕后半期和喂奶的老母猪，喂刚断奶的小猪、要出圈的肥猪，必须另加一些精料和青草，否则猪就长不好。
