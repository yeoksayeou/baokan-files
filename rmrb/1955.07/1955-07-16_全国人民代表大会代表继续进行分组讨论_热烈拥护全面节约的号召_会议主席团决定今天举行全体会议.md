Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued its group discussions today.

    During the group discussions, many deputies emphasized that the guiding principle of focusing on key construction projects in China's socialist industrialization is very clear. The basic task of the First Five-Year Plan stipulates that we must concentrate our main efforts on industrial construction centered around the 156 units designed with Soviet assistance, consisting of 694 construction units above the quota. This can be seen from the total five-year expenditure and the allocation priorities for basic construction investment. In their speeches, many deputies criticized the erroneous ideas of "everything being revitalized," "everything being modernized," "budgeting generously and using sparingly," considering waste as a "minor matter," or "a little waste being inevitable," which violate the guiding principle of focusing on key construction projects. They cited various examples of wasting state funds, emphasizing the importance of launching a comprehensive thrift campaign nationwide. The deputies who spoke expressed their warm endorsement of Vice Premier Li Fuchun's call in his report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, urging a reduction in non-productive construction expenditures, a lowering of the cost of productive construction, a strengthening of economic accounting systems in enterprises, a further reduction in administrative management expenses of state organs, and vigorous promotion of thrift in all aspects. They believe that the State Council's measures to reduce the construction and installation costs of productive construction and to lower the cost of non-productive construction are timely and correct measures. This measure should be implemented vigorously throughout the country.

    Many deputies further pointed out in the discussion that, in order to accumulate funds and build a beautiful socialist society, we must also carry out tremendous ideological work. We must promote a spirit of hard work and plain living among the broad masses of people and all cadres nationwide, promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift, establish a virtue of loving socialist construction and loving public property, and fight against various erroneous ideas and behaviors such as "everything being revitalized," departmentalism, "budgeting generously and using sparingly," extravagance and waste, so that the entire society can adapt to the requirements of national industrialization in all aspects.

    The speeches of many labor models among the deputies especially mentioned that the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing costs stipulated in the draft of the First Five-Year Plan are major and glorious tasks. They said that with the development of socialist construction, the material and cultural living standards of the people throughout the country will continue to improve, which is precisely the goal that socialist construction requires. However, the improvement of people's living standards must be based on the development of production and the increase of labor productivity. Without today's arduous construction, there will be no better and happier life in the future. They expressed their determination to strive to improve their political awareness, improve their cultural and technical levels, learn from advanced experiences, engage in creative labor, and complete the tasks of developing production and increasing labor productivity stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

    At 3:00 p.m. today, the Presidium of the Second Session of the National People's Congress held a meeting and decided to hold a plenary session of the Second Session of the National People's Congress on the afternoon of the 16th.

    全国人民代表大会代表继续进行分组讨论
    热烈拥护全面节约的号召
    会议主席团决定今天举行全体会议
    新华社十五日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天继续进行分组讨论。
    在分组讨论中，许多代表着重指出我国社会主义工业化事业中重点建设的方针是非常明确的。第一个五年计划的基本任务规定：必须集中主要力量进行以苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个单位为中心的、由限额以上的六百九十四个建设单位组成的工业建设。这从五年支出总数和基本建设投资的分配重点上都可以看得出来。许多代表在发言中批判了那种违反重点建设方针的“百废俱兴”、“样样现代化”，在预算上“宽打窄用”、认为浪费是“小事情”或“浪费一点不可避免”的错误思想，并且举出各种浪费国家资金的事例，强调说明在全国范围内开展全面节约运动的重要意义。发言的代表都表示热烈拥护李富春副总理在关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告中提出的削减非生产性建设的支出、降低生产性建设的成本、加强企业部门的经济核算制、更进一步缩减国家机关的行政管理费、从各方面厉行节约的号召。他们认为国务院规定降低生产性建设的建筑安装成本和降低非生产性建设的造价的措施，是一项适时的正确的措施。这一措施，全国都应雷厉风行。
    不少的代表在讨论中进一步指出，为了积累资金，建设美好的社会主义社会，我们还必须进行巨大的思想工作，要在全国广大人民群众中和在全体干部中，提倡艰苦朴素的风气，发扬克勤克俭的优良传统，树立起热爱社会主义建设、热爱公共财产的美德，同百废俱兴、本位主义、宽打窄用、铺张浪费等各种错误的思想和行为作斗争，使得整个社会在各方面都能适应国家工业化的要求。
    代表中许多劳动模范的发言特别提到，第一个五年计划草案规定的提高劳动生产率和降低成本的任务，是一项重大的光荣的任务。他们说，随着社会主义建设的发展，全国人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平将不断地提高，这正是社会主义建设所要求达到的目的。但是，人民生活水平的提高必须建立在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础之上，没有今天的刻苦建设，就不会有将来更加美好幸福的生活。他们表示一定要努力提高政治觉悟，提高文化水平和技术水平，学习先进经验，从事创造性的劳动，完成五年计划所规定的发展生产和提高劳动生产率的任务。
    今天下午三时，全国人民代表大会第二次会议主席团举行会议，决定在十六日下午举行全国人民代表大会第二次会议的全体会议。
