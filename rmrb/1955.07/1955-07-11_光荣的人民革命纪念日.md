    Glorious People's Revolution Anniversary
    Ba. Oqierbat, Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China
    July 11, 1955, is the 34th anniversary of the victory of the national democratic revolution in the Mongolian People's Republic, a national holiday.
    The national democratic revolution of 1921 gave the Mongolian people true freedom and opened the path to light and progress. Colonial and feudal oppression were overthrown forever. For the first time in many years, the working people of Mongolia became the true masters of their own country. An important outpost of the revolutionary awakening of the oppressed colonial Eastern nations was formed.
    On this day, all Mongolian people express their deep gratitude to the great friend of the new Mongolian working people, the powerful Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's constant and comprehensive assistance has always been of decisive significance for the development of the Mongolian People's Republic on the road to building the foundations of socialism. The Mongolian people focus their attention on People's China and all the countries of the powerful socialist camp, whose assistance and cooperation infinitely accelerate our progress.
    The Mongolian national democratic revolution is the offspring of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution exposed the aggressive ambitions of imperialist elements and raised the national consciousness of the Mongolian people.
    The revolution of 1921 destroyed the shackles of foreign colonialists and domestic feudalism that had existed for many years, rescued the country from imperialist enslavement, and created realistic conditions for the non-capitalist development of the Mongolian People's Republic. From the very first days of the victory of the people's revolution, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has guided the country along the non-capitalist, that is, the socialist road of development. All activities of the Party and the People's Government have been focused on eliminating the political and economic rule of the feudal lords, expelling and eradicating the forces of foreign capital, vigorously developing the productive forces, and striving to consolidate the socialist base in the economy by consolidating friendship and fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union. In the past thirty-four years, under the leadership of its People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have repelled more than one imperialist aggression, victoriously defended the independence of their country, and achieved significant achievements on the front of peaceful and creative labor. The once very backward Mongolia has changed beyond recognition in this short historical period. The national economy and culture are developing at an unprecedented speed, and the material and cultural living standards of the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic are constantly improving.
    Pre-revolutionary Mongolia was the most backward country ruled by feudal relations of production and remnants of the patriarchal system. Its economic characteristics were entirely feudal and colonial. The non-religious and religious feudal lord class were the owners of the land, and they owned 49.5 percent of the total number of livestock, while accounting for less than eight percent of the population. All herdsmen were in a state of serfdom directly dependent on the feudal lord class, and the feudal lord class, together with foreign colonialists, exploited the working people in the most barbaric ways.
    One of the biggest factors determining the economic nature of pre-revolutionary Mongolia was the rule of foreign commercial usury capital, which controlled all domestic and foreign trade, as well as the country's financial and credit activities.
    In November 1924, Mongolia was declared a People's Republic. The feudal serf system was abolished, and land was nationalized, thereby eliminating the basis of feudal relations of production.
    The struggle to eliminate feudalism was carried out simultaneously with the struggle for national economic independence.
    Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and the consistent policy of the People's Revolutionary Party, the attempts of American and British imperialism to economically enslave liberated Mongolia were shattered. In December 1921, the first national trade organization in Mongolia, the Mongolian Central People's Cooperative, was established. In the summer of 1924, the Mongolian Industrial and Commercial Bank was established with the help of the Soviet Union. In 1925, currency reform was implemented, and the national currency, the Tugrik, was issued.
    In this way, the Mongolian people gradually grasped the economic lifeline and eradicated the influence of foreign capital in the domestic economy.
    The decisive achievement of the Mongolian people on the road of non-capitalist development of the Republic was the establishment of national industry. During the period from 1921 to 1940, the formation of socialist industry as a sector of the national economy and the emergence of the working class, as well as other economic lifelines held by the state, guaranteed the thoroughness of the development of the people's democratic revolution and the resolute embarking of the whole country on the non-capitalist, that is, the socialist path of development.
    In the emergence and formation of national industry in the Mongolian People's Republic, the assistance of the country where the proletarian revolution had triumphed, the Communist Party and the Leninist-Stalinist foreign policy of the Soviet state—the policy of equality and friendship among all nationalities—played a decisive role.
    Organizing industrial production in the Mongolian People's Republic began with the restoration of existing small enterprises and factories.
    In the period from 1931 to 1940, the process shifted from building individual industrial bases to a more planned and systematic process of expanding modern industry to the entire national economic system. During these years, large enterprises such as the Choibalsan Industrial Combined Factory, the Ulaanbaatar and Khatkhul wool washing factories, and the Ulaanbaatar Central Thermal Power Station were completed and put into production. The production of building materials has been greatly expanded. The Nalaikh coal mine and the work of transporting coal to Ulaanbaatar have been mechanized. As a result, the production volume of wool washing enterprises has increased by nearly one time, and the power generation of power stations has increased by nearly eight times. In 1940, the coal production of the Mongolian People's Republic reached 16.2 times that of 1930.
    During these years, great attention was also paid to the development of the cooperative industry of the Republic.
    The high-speed development of industry in the Mongolian People's Republic is a characteristic of the above-mentioned period. In 1940, industrial output increased more than 99 times compared to 1930. The fixed assets of industry increased by 42.6 times, and the number of industrial workers increased by 13.8 times.
    Therefore, by 1940, a modern multi-sector industry—a strong economic pillar in the national economic system of the people's democratic state—had been established in the Mongolian People's Republic.
    In 1940, Marshal Choibalsan pointed out: "Now we can say with full confidence that we have firmly embarked on the path of non-capitalist development... We have avoided the danger of capitalist development, developed public ownership in the country, and established new human relations, without the relationship of man exploiting man and man oppressing man.
    The Marxist-Leninist theory that backward countries can embark on the path of non-capitalist development with the help of countries where socialism has triumphed has been brilliantly confirmed in our country."
    During the years of World War II, thanks to the selfless labor of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, the Mongolian People's Republic victoriously overcame all the difficulties of the war. The national economy and culture continued to develop. The Mongolian people are proud that, in the days of severe trials, they were able to do their best to help their great friend—the heroic Soviet people—in the noble struggle against the fascist army. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, in close combat coordination with the Soviet army, made valuable contributions to the victory over Japanese imperialism.
    In the post-war years, the Mongolian People's Republic transitioned to long-term plans for economic and cultural construction, achieving great achievements for our people in building the foundations of socialism. Under the long-tested leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic successfully completed the tasks of the first five-year plan (1948-1952) for the development of the national economy and culture. During the first five-year plan, thanks to the constant assistance of the Soviet Union, socialist industry, mechanized transportation, and other sectors of the national economy developed rapidly. The socialist component of agriculture has also been significantly strengthened and expanded.
    The victory of the great Chinese people created the best environment for peaceful construction in the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1949, the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China established normal diplomatic relations. In October 1952, the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement was signed. Friendly relations and cooperation with all other people's democratic countries have also been established, which is of great significance for the development and further strengthening of the friendship between the Mongolian people and the people of the democratic camp.
    The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held at the end of last year was a major event in the life of the Mongolian people. The Congress formulated a great program for the further development of the Mongolian People's Republic along the road of building the foundations of socialism, and adopted the instructions for the second five-year plan (1953-1957) on the development of our country's national economy and culture. Inspired by the resolutions of the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people are working with full enthusiasm for the happiness of the motherland, and are making due contributions to the cause of consolidating the peace of all countries.
    On the glorious anniversary of the People's Revolution, the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic and their friends—the powerful Soviet Union, the great China, the heroic Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and the people of Vietnam—are all rejoicing at the real and great achievements of the peaceful construction of the Mongolian People's Republic. Under the tireless care of the Party and the government and the selfless labor of the herdsmen, the main sector of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, animal husbandry, has increased in quantity and has also led to changes in social relations. The total number of livestock has increased by 166 percent from 1924 to 1954. In terms of population, the number of livestock in the Mongolian People's Republic now ranks first in the world. All livestock now belongs to the working people. Agriculture has also developed. For example, a vast network of machine mowing stations, veterinary stations, and livestock artificial insemination stations has been established to help herdsmen, which has become a strong pillar of the country. In the socialist transformation of agriculture, herdsmen's production cooperatives and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms play a significant role. There are more than 200 herdsmen's production cooperatives in the Republic, with tens of thousands of members. Their public livestock exceeds one million heads, that is, almost ten times that of 1950.
    The socialist industry of the Mongolian People's Republic, established in the era of the people's government, has become a leading sector of our economy. From 1940 to 1954, the output of industrial products increased by more than two times, and it is now no less than one-half of the total industrial and agricultural output. The main direction of industrial development in the Mongolian People's Republic is the processing of livestock product raw materials. In the post-war years, dozens of large-scale enterprises for mining, petroleum, meat production, building materials, and other enterprises have been put into production. The industrial power base has been greatly expanded. Coal mining and electricity production have almost doubled.
    Modern transportation in the Mongolian People's Republic has only developed after the people's revolution. In addition to the widespread use of automobile transportation, railway transportation and air transportation have also been developed. The first railway from Ulaanbaatar to the Nalaikh coal mine was opened to traffic in 1938. During the first five-year plan, the length of the railway line more than doubled. This year, the construction project of the Ulaanbaatar-Zamyn-Üüd section has been completed, and the Moscow-Ulaanbaatar-Beijing line passes through this railway.
    A great achievement of the Mongolian people is the realization of the cultural revolution. Our country has eliminated illiteracy and opened 351 primary schools, 43 seven-year schools, and 28 middle schools; almost all school-age children have been enrolled. The National University named after Marshal Choibalsan, the National Normal University, and the Senior Party School, which our people are proud of, have become true training grounds for cultivating young experts for all sectors of the national economy. At the same time, there are more than ten secondary technical schools and secondary vocational schools working. All of this enables us to transition to universal compulsory secondary education in cities and primary education for children in rural areas, and to broadly raise the issue of comprehensively developing scientific research work, and demonstrates the tremendous surge in the cultural level of our people.
    While preparing to celebrate the 34th anniversary of the People's Democratic Revolution, the Mongolian people are selflessly struggling to successfully complete the plan for 1955—the decisive third year of the second five-year plan.
    The national holiday of the Mongolian People's Republic is being prepared under the further consolidation of the centuries-old friendship between the Mongolian people and the powerful Chinese people. Thousands of Chinese workers have come to our country to help socialist construction. The labor enthusiasm and heroism of our Chinese friends are inspiring and encouraging our people to establish new and remarkable achievements on the front of peaceful construction.
    Our people use selfless labor to confirm their indomitable will for peace and believe that the powerful worldwide movement for the friendship, peace, and happiness of the working people of all countries will surely win. The peace-loving Mongolian people angrily denounce the attempts of imperialists headed by the United States to drag the people of the world into a new war, and fully support and support the various peaceful measures taken by the Soviet Union, People's China, the countries of the democratic camp, and all progressive mankind to ease international tensions and consolidate peace, strengthen friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation among the people of all countries. Our working people defend the magnificent cause of peace and regard the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union and the great People's China as the pillar of world peace.
    The people of all countries will surely be able to defend their sacred right to life and progress, peace and happiness. Peace will surely triumph over war!

    光荣的人民革命纪念日
    蒙古人民共和国驻华大使　巴·奥其尔巴特
    一九五五年七月十一日是蒙古人民共和国民族民主革命胜利三十四周年的全民节日。
    一九二一年的民族民主革命给了蒙古人民以真正的自由，开辟了走向光明和进步的道路。殖民压迫和封建压迫被永远推翻了。多年以来，蒙古劳动人民第一次成为自己国家的真正的主人。殖民地的东方被压迫民族的革命觉醒的重要前哨形成了。
    在这一天，全体蒙古人民都对新蒙古劳动人民的伟大朋友、强大的苏联表示深切的感谢。苏联经常的、全面的援助对蒙古人民共和国在建设社会主义基础的道路上的发展一向有着决定性的意义。蒙古人民把自己的视线集中在人民中国和强大的社会主义阵营的一切国家，它们的援助和合作无限地加快我们的前进。
    蒙古的民族民主革命是伟大十月社会主义革命的产儿。十月革命揭露了帝国主义分子的侵略野心，提高了蒙古人民的民族觉悟。
    一九二一年的革命摧毁了多年来外国殖民者和国内封建制度的枷锁，把国家从帝国主义奴役下挽救出来，并为蒙古人民共和国的非资本主义发展创造了现实的条件。蒙古人民革命党从人民革命胜利的最初日子起就引导国家沿着非资本主义的，也就是社会主义的道路发展。党和人民政府的全部活动曾集中在消灭封建主的政治上和经济上的统治，驱逐和肃清外国资本的势力，全力发展生产力，用竭力巩固同苏联的友谊和兄弟般的合作来发展和巩固经济中的社会主义基地。在过去三十四年当中，蒙古人民在自己的人民革命党的领导下，击退了帝国主义者不止一次的侵犯，胜利地捍卫了自己国家的独立，并在和平的创造性劳动战线上获得重大的成就。不久以前非常落后的蒙古，在这一个短短的历史时期内改变得认不出来了。国民经济和文化以空前未有的速度发展着，蒙古人民共和国劳动人民的物质文化水平不断提高。
    革命前的蒙古是一个由封建生产关系和宗法制度残余统治的最落后的国家。它的经济特征完全是封建殖民地的。非宗教封建主和宗教封建主阶级是土地的所有者，他们不到居民人数的百分之八，却拥有牲畜总头数的百分之四十九点五。所有的牧民都处在直接依赖封建主阶级的农奴状态中，封建主阶级同外国殖民者一起用最野蛮的方式剥削劳动人民。
    决定蒙古革命前的经济性质的一个最大的因素，是外国商业高利贷资本的统治，它握有国内外的全部贸易以及国家的财政和信贷活动。
    一九二四年十一月蒙古宣布为人民共和国。废除了封建农奴制度，实行了土地国有化，从而消灭了封建的生产关系的基础。
    争取消灭封建主义的斗争是和争取国家经济独立的斗争同时进行的。
    由于苏联的帮助和人民革命党的始终一贯的政策，美英帝国主义想在经济上奴役解放了的蒙古的企图被粉碎了。一九二一年十二月，建立了蒙古第一个全国性的贸易组织——蒙古中央人民合作社，一九二四年夏天，在苏联的帮助下建立了蒙古工商业银行。一九二五年实行了货币改革，发行了本国的货币图格里克。
    蒙古人民就这样一步步地掌握了经济命脉，铲除了外国资本在国内经济上的影响。
    蒙古人民在争取共和国的非资本主义发展道路上的决定性成就，是民族工业的建立。在一九二一年至一九四○年期间，作为国民经济一个部门的社会主义工业的形成和工人阶级的产生，以及其他由国家所握有的经济命脉，保证了人民民主革命发展的彻底性和全国的坚决走上非资本主义的，即社会主义的发展道路。
    在蒙古人民共和国民族工业的产生和形成中，无产阶级革命胜利了的国家的援助，共产党和苏维埃国家的列宁斯大林的对外政策——各族人民平等和友谊的政策，都起了决定性的作用。
    组织蒙古人民共和国的工业生产，是从恢复国内已有的小型企业和工厂开始着手的。
    在一九三一年到一九四○年这个时期，从建设个别的工业基地的过程过渡到比较有计划、有步骤地把现代化工业扩展到全国国民经济系统的过程。在这几年间建成并投入生产的大企业有乔巴山工业联合工厂、乌兰巴托和哈特呼尔的洗毛厂、乌兰巴托中央热电站等。建筑材料的生产大大地扩大了。那莱哈煤矿和往乌兰巴托运煤的工作都已机械化。结果，洗毛企业的生产量提高了将近一倍，电站发电量提高了将近八倍。一九四○年蒙古人民共和国的煤产量达到了一九三○年的十六点二倍。
    在这几年间对共和国的合作社工业的发展也给了很大的注意。
    蒙古人民共和国工业的高速度发展是上述时期的特点。一九四○年工业产量比一九三○年提高九十九倍以上。工业的固定基金增加了四十二点六倍，产业工人的数量增加了十三点八倍。
    因此，到一九四○年在蒙古人民共和国已经建立起了现代化的多部门的工业——人民民主国家国民经济系统中的强大的经济支柱。
    一九四○年乔巴山元帅指出：“现在我们可以满怀信心地说，我们已经牢固地走上了非资本主义的发展道路……我们避免了资本主义发展的危险，在国内发展公有生产，建立新的人与人的关系，没有人剥削人、人压迫人的关系。
    马克思列宁主义关于落后国家在社会主义胜利了的国家的帮助下可以走上非资本主义发展道路的学说，在我国的条件下被辉煌地证实了。”
    在第二次世界大战的年代里，由于工人、农民和知识分子的忘我的劳动，蒙古人民共和国胜利地克服了战时的一切困难。国民经济和文化照旧得到了不断的发展。蒙古人民引以自豪的是，在严酷的考验的日子里，能够尽力帮助自己伟大的朋友——英勇的苏联人民进行反法西斯大军的崇高斗争，蒙古人民革命军在与苏军的紧密战斗配合之下，在战胜日本帝国主义方面作出了宝贵的贡献。
    战后年代的蒙古人民共和国过渡到经济和文化建设的远景计划，取得了我国人民在建设社会主义基础方面的伟大成就，蒙古人民共和国劳动人民在蒙古人民革命党的久经考验的领导下，顺利地完成了发展国民经济和文化的第一个五年计划（一九四八年—一九五二年）的任务。在第一个五年计划期间，由于苏联的经常援助，社会主义的工业、机械化的运输业和其他国民经济部门迅速地发展起来。农业的社会主义成分也显著地加强和扩大了。
    伟大的中国人民的胜利为蒙古人民共和国创造了和平建设的最良好的环境。一九四九年，蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国建立了正常的外交关系，一九五二年十月签订了中蒙经济及文化合作协定。同其他一切人民民主国家的友好关系和合作也建立起来，这对于蒙古人民同民主阵营各国人民的友谊的发展和进一步加强是有着重大意义的。
    去年年底举行的蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会是蒙古人民生活中的重大事件。代表大会制定了蒙古人民共和国沿着建设社会主义基础的道路进一步发展的伟大纲领，通过了一九五三年——一九五七年关于发展我国国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划的指示。为蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会各项决议所鼓舞的蒙古人民，为了祖国的幸福，正在满腔热忱地工作着，并以此为巩固各国人民的和平事业作出应有的贡献。
    在人民革命的光荣纪念日，蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民和他们的朋友——强大的苏联、伟大的中国、英勇的朝鲜、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国、阿尔巴尼亚和越南的人民，都因蒙古人民共和国的和平建设的真正的巨大成就而感到高兴。蒙古人民共和国国民经济的主要部门畜牧业，在党和政府的孜孜不倦的关怀和牧民的忘我的劳动下，在数量上增多了，并且也引起了社会关系的变化。牲畜总头数从一九二四年到
  一九五四年增加了百分之一百六十六。按人口计算，蒙古人民共和国的牲畜数量，现在在世界上占第一位。所有的牲畜现在都属于劳动人民。现在农业也有了发展。如帮助牧民建立了广大的机器割草站、兽医站和牲畜人工授精站的分布网，它们已成为国家的强有力的支柱。在农业的社会主义改造中，牧民生产合作社和国营农牧场起着重大的作用。在共和国内共有二百多个牧民生产合作社，拥有社员数万名。它们的公共牲畜超过了一百万头，也就是说，几乎达到一九五○年的十倍。
    在人民政权年代建立的蒙古人民共和国的社会主义工业已成为我国经济的一个主导部门。由一九四○年到一九五四年，工业品的产量增加了两倍多，并且已不少于工农业总产量的二分之一。蒙古人民共和国工业发展的主要方向是对畜产品原料的加工。在战后年代，已有几十个采矿、石油、生产肉品、建筑材料的大型企业和别的一些企业投入了生产。工业的动力基地大大扩充了。煤的开采和电力生产几乎增加了一倍。
    蒙古人民共和国的现代化的运输，只是在人民革命后才发展起来。除了广泛利用汽车运输外，也发展了铁路运输和空运。第一条从乌兰巴托市到那莱哈煤矿的铁路已在一九三八年通车。在第一个五年计划年代铁路线的长度增加了一倍多。今年已完成了乌兰巴托—扎木乌得段的建筑工程，莫斯科—乌兰巴托—北京的线路就是通过这条铁路的。
    蒙古人民的一项巨大成就是实现了文化革命。我国已扫除了文盲，开设了三百五十一所小学，四十三所七年制学校和二十八所中学；所有的学龄儿童几乎已全部入学。为我国人民所自豪的以乔巴山元帅命名的国立大学、国立师范大学、高级党校已成为为国民经济各部门造就青年专家的真正养成所。同时还有十多个中等技术学校和中等专科学校在工作。这一切使我们能够过渡到城市的普及义务中等教育和乡村的初级儿童教育，能够广泛地提出关于全面发展科学研究工作的问题，并表明了我国人民文化水平的巨大高涨。
    蒙古人民在筹备庆祝人民民主革命三十四周年时，正在为顺利完成一九五五年——第二个五年计划有决定意义的第三年的计划而忘我地斗争。
    蒙古人民共和国的全民节日，是在蒙古人民同强大的中国人民的许多世纪以来的友谊进一步巩固的情况下进行筹备的。成千上万的中国工人来到我国帮助社会主义建设，我们的中国朋友的劳动热忱和英雄主义，都振奋着和鼓舞着我国人民在和平建设战线上建立日新月异的功绩。
    我国人民用忘我的劳动来确证自己对和平的不屈不挠的意志，并且相信争取各国劳动人民友好、和平和幸福的遍及全世界的强大运动一定会胜利。爱好和平的蒙古人民愤怒地斥责以美国为首的帝国主义者把全世界人民拖向新战争的企图，全力拥护和支持苏联、人民中国、民主阵营各国和全体进步人类为缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平、加强各国人民之间的友谊、互相了解和合作而采取的各项和平措施。我国劳动人民捍卫着宏伟壮丽的和平事业，并把以强大的苏联和伟大的人民中国为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营看作世界和平的支柱。
    各国人民一定能捍卫住自己要求生活和进步、和平和幸福的神圣权利。和平一定能战胜战争！
