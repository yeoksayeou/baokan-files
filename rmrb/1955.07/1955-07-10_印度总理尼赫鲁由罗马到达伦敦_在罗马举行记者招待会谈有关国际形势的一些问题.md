Xinhua News Agency, July 9th. According to Western news agencies, Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Rome on the morning of July 7th from Yugoslavia, and subsequently arrived in London by plane on the evening of the 8th. Nehru will hold talks with British Prime Minister Eden to exchange views on the recent developments in the world situation before the Geneva Four-Power Summit.

During his stay in Rome, Nehru exchanged views with the new Italian Prime Minister Segni on major issues in the current international situation.

Before departing for London on the 8th, Nehru held a press conference in Rome. In his speech at the meeting, he believed that the Geneva Four-Power Summit might produce "hopeful results." He said: "The Geneva Conference may be one of a series of conferences. After this conference, other meetings of different levels may follow, and government summits may be held later."

When Nehru talked about his views on the future of world peace after meeting with Soviet leaders, he said: "I am definitely leaving with the impression that the hope of achieving peace and solving problems peacefully is now greater than ever before." He emphasized: "Any view that the current Soviet policy is due to internal weakness is completely wrong."

Nehru reiterated the necessity of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world, and he cited the Bandung Asian-African Conference as an important example of how countries with different views can gather together.

　　印度总理尼赫鲁由罗马到达伦敦
　  在罗马举行记者招待会谈有关国际形势的一些问题
    新华社九日讯　据西方通讯社报道，印度总理尼赫鲁七日上午由南斯拉夫到达罗马，随后在八日晚乘飞机抵达伦敦。尼赫鲁将同英国首相艾登进行会谈，以便在日内瓦四国首脑会议前夕交换关于最近世界形势发展的意见。
    尼赫鲁在罗马逗留期间曾同意大利新任总理塞尼就当前国际局势中的重大问题交换意见。
    尼赫鲁在八日动身前往伦敦以前在罗马举行了记者招待会。他在会上发表的谈话中认为：日内瓦四国首脑会议可能产生“有希望的结果”。他说：“日内瓦会议可能是一系列会议中的一个会议。在这次会议以后可能接着举行其他不同等级的会议，而且以后可能还要举行政府首脑会议。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到同苏联领袖会谈以后他对世界和平前途的看法时说：“我肯定地是带着这样一种印象离开的：实现和平以及用和平的方法来解决问题的希望现在要比以前任何时候为大。”他强调指出：
  “认为目前苏联的政策是由于内部软弱所产生的任何看法都是完全错误的。”
    尼赫鲁重申世界各国和平共处的必要性，他引证万隆的亚非会议作为具有不同见解的国家如何可以共聚一堂的一个重要的范例。
