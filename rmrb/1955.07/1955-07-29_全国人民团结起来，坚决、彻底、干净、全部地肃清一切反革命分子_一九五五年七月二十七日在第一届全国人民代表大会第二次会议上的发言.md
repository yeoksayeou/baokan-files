Unite the People of the Whole Country, Resolutely, Thoroughly, Cleanly, and Completely Eliminate All Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    – Speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on July 27, 1955
    Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Minister of Public Security

    I fully support the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China, and I fully agree with the reports of the four Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    I would like to talk about an important guarantee for realizing our socialist construction plan – suppressing the activities of counter-revolutionary elements.
    While the people of the whole country are fighting with joy and excitement to create our future happiness, the activities carried out by counter-revolutionary elements are just the opposite. They try every possible means to destroy the people's property, sabotage socialist construction, and vainly attempt to subvert the People's Republic of China, so that our country will still regress to the oppressed, backward, and impoverished semi-colonial and semi-feudal era. Therefore, to tolerate the activities of counter-revolutionary elements means that socialist construction cannot be carried out safely; to carry out socialist construction safely means that the activities of counter-revolutionary elements cannot be tolerated.
    Am I exaggerating the facts by saying this? Then, let us look at a few examples to see how counter-revolutionary elements have been sabotaging our construction recently.
    In January 1954, the Wuhu Yarn Factory in Anhui was set on fire by counter-revolutionary elements, destroying more than 23,000 spindles and causing a loss of more than 1.6 million yuan.
      In June 1954, Jiang Kai-shek's special agent, Tian Yukun, an employee of the Third Branch of the Shenyang Construction Engineering Bureau, set fire to the construction site's material warehouse and three dormitories, and knocked out Comrade Zhang Dianlong, the secretary of the Communist Party branch at the construction site, who was trying to put out the fire.
      In October 1954, Gong A'bao, a counter-revolutionary element at the Shanghai Petroleum Wholesale Station, took advantage of being on duty during the National Day holiday to secretly open the station's No. 202 oil tank, causing oil to flow into the river leading to the Huangpu River, attempting to cause a serious fire. Fortunately, the river had been blocked beforehand, and a major disaster was averted, but more than 2,600 catties of oil had been released.
      In October 1954, Guangzhou cracked down on a conspiracy group of 31 counter-revolutionary elements headed by Jiang Kai-shek's special agent, Lü Baobing. This group of counter-revolutionary bandits prepared凶器 such as hammers, iron bars, and lime, and planned to disguise themselves as passengers and hijack the Minsheng Shipping Company's Minzu Wheel to Taiwan during its voyage.
      In June 1955, the wheat field of the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chaoyi County, Shaanxi, was set on fire by counter-revolutionary elements, and more than 100 mu of wheat on the threshing ground was completely burned.
    These undeniable facts show that counter-revolutionary elements are carrying out frantic sabotage against our capital construction, industry, commerce, transportation, and agriculture.
    Many acts of sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements are carried out through certain techniques.
      In March 1954, the only five-ton large steam hammer in the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, which had just been installed, was deliberately damaged by counter-revolutionary element Fu Jiabang under the pretext of test hammering. This steam hammer could forge forgings of more than ten tons and create a wealth of 10,000 yuan every day.
    In March 1954, a huge cavity was discovered at the top of Tunnel No. 20 on the Fengsha Railway. Engineer Dong Diankai, a counter-revolutionary element, deliberately violated the construction rules he knew well, filling the cavity with waste wood and covering it with mortar to conceal the hidden danger, plotting to cause the tunnel to collapse when the railway was opened to traffic, attempting to cause an unpredictable serious accident.
    In July 1954, at the No. 1 Mine of the Xiahuayuan Coal Mine in Hebei, Li Dehou, the deputy director and chief technician and a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, deliberately adopted incorrect mining methods, causing a large amount of gas to accumulate, resulting in an explosion that killed 38 employees and workers and poisoned 156 people, causing direct property losses of more than 500,000 yuan.
    In March 1953, Zhang Yun, an assistant engineer in a certain defense factory and a member of the Kuomintang, privately altered blueprints, resulting in 8,400 defective and reworked parts, and all 509 assembled weapons failed to fire accurately during test firings. This was not only a huge loss of state property, but also these weapons could not kill the enemy on the battlefield and could even kill our own people.
    Our nation's workers, farmers, intellectuals, and all patriotic and kind people have devoted so much labor and overcome so many difficulties every day, every month, and every year in order to develop production and build the motherland! But these counter-revolutionary robbers can cause so many precious lives to die and countless wealth to be turned into ashes with just one bad idea. Look at how vicious and ruthless counter-revolutionary elements are in order to sabotage socialist construction!
    Perhaps some people think that counter-revolutionary elements sabotage socialist construction because they oppose socialism and the socialist state, but they may not oppose ordinary people? Facts prove that this idea is wrong. For example, during the flood control struggle in Wuhan in the summer of 1954, which was related to the safety of all residents, wouldn't counter-revolutionary elements refrain from sabotage? But Li Jianqin, a former Jiang Kai-shek major and seventh-grade technician, deliberately sabotaged a one-ton bulldozer used for repairing dikes, rendering it unable to push earth for seven days. Another Kuomintang member and landlord, Wang Jieying, a technician at the telecommunications bureau, deliberately burned down the transformer in the substation at a critical time when water was being pumped out of the city, causing 60 water pumps to stop for 18 hours. More than 100 similar sabotage incidents occurred from late June to late August, not including other incidents such as setting off signal flares, spreading rumors, inciting migrant workers to flee, taking the opportunity to disrupt the market, and adulterating and swindling money in the manufacture of flood control materials.
    What do these facts show? These facts show that counter-revolutionary elements are absolutely isolated among the people, and they have no common interests with any ordinary people. They hate the people, hate humanity, and hate society. "I almost hate everyone," the words of Hu Feng's followers represent the psychological state of all counter-revolutionary elements.
    Although counter-revolutionary elements are some desperate bandits, they are encouraged and instructed by imperialism and the Jiang Kai-shek gang, so their activities are far from limited to sabotaging construction. They are also vainly attempting to subvert the People's Republic of China and realize a counter-revolutionary restoration.
    In order to carry out subversive activities, counter-revolutionary elements try their best to buy over some social dregs to join their organizations and use various names to deceive some backward elements to be their tools. According to incomplete statistics from eight provinces, Henan, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Shanghai in 1954, a total of 83 counter-revolutionary group cases were cracked, of which 27 involved 1,074 counter-revolutionary elements. The so-called "Second Group of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang" of Jiang Kai-shek's secret service organization in Hong Kong once stipulated to a special agent they dispatched, Xu Boping, that if he developed 15 people, he would receive a monthly salary of HK$100; if he developed 25 people, he would receive HK$200 per month. This bandit indeed developed 19 special agents within half a year. We all know that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group also developed in accordance with this policy of "winning people over and contacting people."
    Some secret organizations formed by illegal elements in the bourgeoisie to resist socialist transformation have increased in the past two years compared with the "Five-Anti" period, and some of them have even directly embarked on the road of counter-revolution. For example, in July 1954, Zhou Changming, the boss of Shanghai Xiangtai Sawmill, colluded with his henchmen to organize the so-called "General Association of All Circles of People to Oppose Communism" and distributed counter-revolutionary leaflets.
      Counter-revolutionary elements lurking in religious groups are also carrying out conspiracies to develop counter-revolutionary secret organizations under the guise of religious activities. In May 1953 and March 1954, two secret organizations that used the name of Catholicism to carry out rebellious activities were cracked in Xian County and Yongnian County, Hebei. More than 110 cellars, darkrooms, and false walls were found, and the largest cellar could accommodate more than 100 people.
    Reactionary secret societies are also an important way for counter-revolutionary elements to develop organizations. In January 1955, Shaanxi Province cracked a "Zhongdao" disguised as "Yiguandao." Only 434 reactionary leaders were arrested, 102 various cellars and darkrooms were dug up, and a large number of guns, bullets, Jiang Kai-shek party flags, and other counter-revolutionary criminal evidence were seized.
    One of the important contents of the subversive activities of counter-revolutionary elements is to steal many confidential intelligence of our country and send it to the enemy.
    For example, Li Fangwu, the supervisor of Tianjin Wuda Trading Company, went to Hong Kong in July 1954 to receive training and tasks from the secret service organization, responsible for investigating the serial numbers, equipment, and deployments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the distribution of heavy industrial factories and mines, and the control status of communication equipment, etc., for the enemy; he not only used his own enterprise to establish a "transportation station" in Tianjin, but also planned to recruit his brother and friends to establish "transportation sub-stations" in Lanzhou and Shenyang.
    Xu Mengkui, the manager of Shanghai Donghuayuan Preserved Plum Factory, joined a secret service organization in Hong Kong in 1951. After returning to Shanghai in the same year, he reported military and political intelligence to the secret service organization in Hong Kong more than ten times in more than a year using secret writing methods. The military intelligence included the berthing situation of naval ships.
    Jiang Kai-shek's special agent, Wang Dizhong, sneaked into Guangdong in 1953 and fraudulently obtained the position of technician at the design company of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau. In half a year, he sent more than 20 pieces of military, political, and engineering intelligence to Jiang Kai-shek's secret service organization in Hong Kong. The engineering intelligence included detailed information about the newly built shipyard in Guangzhou; in addition, he also collected information about eight items, including the Wuhan Shipyard and the Yangtze River Bridge, preparing to send them out.
    Li Ying, a special agent dispatched by the US Central Intelligence Agency, sneaked into Guangzhou in March 1954 and also sent more than 20 pieces of intelligence about the Guangzhou garrison, anti-aircraft artillery positions, airports, and the transportation situation of the Yuehan Railway to the US secret service organization in Hong Kong in half a year.
    When counter-revolutionary elements believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of in certain rural areas, they also attempt to riot.
    For example, in December 1954, in Dongyang County, Zhejiang, counter-revolutionary elements gathered more than 100 bandits, calling themselves the "Anti-Communist Headquarters," and attacked the People's Committees of Xianggang Township and Zhaikou Township in separate routes. The head and deputy head of Xianggang Township were both tied up and砍伤. Fortunately, the county public security forces arrived in time to rescue them.
    Wu Jiesan, a special agent jointly dispatched by the US "Free China Movement Headquarters" and Jiang Kai-shek's "Presidential Palace Information Group," developed a special agent organization and collected weapons after sneaking back to his home in Lujiang, Anhui, attempting to take advantage of the flood in the autumn of 1954 to establish a so-called "guerrilla base" in the Dabie Mountains.
    In 1954, seven "emperors" appeared in Heze, Shandong, and another one appeared in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei in March 1955; this is also a form of enemy-organized riots.
    Another prominent activity of counter-revolutionary elements is murder and assassination.
    On February 28, 1955, Li Jingyun, the financial committee member of the Dayushu Village Vegetable Production Cooperative in the western suburbs of Shenyang, and his family of eight were killed by three counter-revolutionary rich peasants.
    On May 3, 1955, Chen Zhirong, the former Kuomintang district branch secretary in Yumen, Gansu, killed his two younger brothers, sisters-in-law, nephews, and nieces and砍伤 his wife at night because he resented his family members for opposing his counter-revolutionary activities and forcing him to work. He then ran to the township People's Committee in an attempt to kill the township head and the secretary of the Communist Party branch.
    Wang Pichang and two other counter-revolutionary elements, the original Kuomintang district branch secretary, who infiltrated the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei, deliberately caused multiple medical accidents from 1952 to 1954, resulting in two disabilities and ten deaths, including one secretary of the Communist Party County Committee. They even得意忘形 said to the Communist Party members in the hospital: "You are the Communist Party, I am the Kuomintang, you say what to do."
    But counter-revolutionary elements are not satisfied with killing a few people. On the eve of the 1954 National Day, Jiang Kai-shek's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics sent its deputy director of the action department, Yao Kairu, to Hong Kong to arrange a large-scale explosion in Guangzhou. Starting in June 1954, Yao Fei individually selected, trained, and dispatched 12 special agents, who were completely under Yao Fei's individual command, individually assigned tasks, and supplied with explosives. The blasting equipment received by these bandits included 54 boxes of American-made high explosives, incendiary agents, and detonators. The bandits planned to carry out explosions on National Day in 1954, targeting National Day memorial venues, parades, theaters, tea houses, factories, warehouses, oil depots, stations, bridges, barracks, airports, government agencies, and so on.
    The crimes of counter-revolutionary elements are endless. But I think that from the examples I just gave, their hideous faces can already be seen.
    Fellow Representatives! Can anyone of us here tolerate these heinous and inhumane counter-revolutionary bandits? Can any kind Chinese person, anyone who hopes that China will become rich and strong, that society will progress, or even just hopes that they can live and work in peace and contentment, remain indifferent to the heinous crimes of these bandits? Can anyone who hears such shocking conspiracies still think that counter-revolutionary elements are just "a few loaches who can't make big waves" and thus comfort themselves?
    Or someone may ask, since large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries and multiple social reform movements have been carried out since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and a large number of counter-revolutionary elements have been suppressed in these movements, why are there still so many counter-revolutionary elements active at present?
    There is no doubt that since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement and various social reform movements, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements have been greatly hit, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been greatly consolidated. Thanks to the joint efforts of the government and the masses of the people, most of the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements have been prevented in advance, and the destruction incidents that have already been caused can generally be solved quickly. In 1954 alone, 619 cases of espionage and sabotage were solved. But we must never be complacent because of this. As mentioned above, counter-revolutionary elements have still caused a lot of serious destruction; and more importantly, there are still a large number of counter-revolutionary elements lurking, preparing to create more destruction.
    Of course, counter-revolutionary elements account for only a very small number of the national population, and the number will continue to decrease in the future. But in our big country with a population of 600 million, the number of counter-revolutionary elements is definitely more than just a few hundred or a few thousand. Everyone knows that the only future for counter-revolutionary elements is destruction; but we cannot imagine that they will be completely eliminated in a short period of time. This is because:
    First, we must remember that only six years ago, most of our country's land was still ruled by counter-revolutionary forces, and the garbage left over from the years of counter-revolutionary rule cannot be completely swept away all at once.
    Second, we must also remember that although the counter-revolutionary rule has been completely overthrown on the mainland of our country, the Jiang Kai-shek gang is still entrenched in Taiwan under the protection of US imperialism, imperialism is still surrounding us, and the counter-revolutionary elements inside our country are still being supported by imperialism and the Jiang Kai-shek gang. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson brazenly testified before the US House Appropriations Committee on February 10, 1955, saying: "The way we hope to solve the problem of mainland China... is to use actions that promote internal disintegration." In the annual budget of the US government, there is openly a fund of $100 million specifically used to subvert various countries in the socialist camp, of which $50 million can be secretly used by the government without reporting to Congress. The United States has established a large number of espionage organizations around our country. Obviously, their policies are not set in vain, their money is not spent in vain, and their organizations are not set up in vain. As for the strength used by the Jiang Kai-shek gang to carry out espionage activities, everyone knows it.
    Third, we must also remember that our country is in a period of intense class struggle. Many of the past counter-revolutionary elements who have not been suppressed, or counter-revolutionary elements who have been released after serving their sentences, the landlord class elements who have been hit in the land reform, and other elements who have been justly hit for various crimes such as corruption, theft, and homicide, have not settled down because of this, and are still plotting revenge; and in the process of socialist transformation, some bourgeois elements and rich peasant elements refuse to be transformed and plot to resist.
    In this way, the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries becomes a rather long-term struggle. As long as classes exist domestically and imperialism exists abroad, the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries will inevitably exist.
    The suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement in 1951 achieved great results, but we should see that the main focus of that movement was on overt counter-revolutionary elements, and not many hidden counter-revolutionary elements were discovered and suppressed, and the enemy's main mode of activity today is covert. Because the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China have been loved and supported by the broad masses of the people, counter-revolutionary elements in most cases have to disguise themselves in order to protect themselves and strive to sneak into the Communist Party, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, government agencies, and the People's Liberation Army to carry out sabotage. Most of the examples of counter-revolutionary activities mentioned earlier were carried out by hidden counter-revolutionary elements. It is already known that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group elements disguised themselves as progressive writers, and many of them even sneaked into the Communist Party organization. Counter-revolutionary elements even sneaked into the party's leading departments and even the public security departments. Pan Hannian, the former deputy mayor of Shanghai, colluded with the enemy's secret service organization for a long time. Yang Fan, the former director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, under the joint instigation of the Communist Party traitor Rao Shushi and Pan Hannian, sheltered, covered up, and appointed a large number of special agents and counter-revolutionary elements behind the back of the Central Committee, so that the activities of Jiang Kai-shek's secret service organization were given a護身符. Various hidden counter-revolutionary elements have not been fully hit in the past suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, which is an important reason why counter-revolutionary activities have appeared rampant recently.
    What measures should we take to deal with counter-revolutionary elements who are so rampant in their activities? We have two paths to choose from.
    One is to compromise with them and implement peaceful coexistence. But they do not agree with this, and they are not willing to coexist peacefully with us. The purpose of counter-revolutionary elements is to eliminate us. Some people say: We should be more lenient towards counter-revolutionary elements and give them a way out. But the opposite is true. We have always implemented a policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements, and we will continue to implement this policy in the future. Counter-revolutionary elements understand this. And those resolute counter-revolutionary elements are not moved by leniency, but often take advantage of our excessive leniency to do evil. Li Dehou, the member of the Three People's Principles Youth League mentioned earlier, was sentenced to two years in prison with a reprieve in 1950 for a gas explosion. Isn't this considered leniency? Doesn't he have a way out? Was he moved? His "moved" performance was to cause another explosion that injured and killed 194 people! Some people also say: The reason why counter-revolutionary elements are active is because there are shortcomings in our work. But the people see the shortcomings in our work and the counter-revolutionary elements see the shortcomings in our work are completely different. The people think that our failure to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements is the biggest shortcoming, but the counter-revolutionary elements think that our not allowing them to have the freedom to be counter-revolutionary is the biggest shortcoming. Chen Zhirong, a counter-revolutionary element in Yumen, killed his entire family because his family members did not want him to continue to be counter-revolutionary. Can this be said to be a shortcoming of his family members? No one provoked the special agents who were preparing to explode in Guangzhou, but they attempted to kill a large number of people in Guangzhou by bombing; no one provoked the special agents who were hidden in the flood control organization in Wuhan, but they attempted to drown a large number of people in Wuhan. Everyone, please see, what peaceful coexistence can there be with counter-revolutionary elements? If we promote peaceful coexistence with counter-revolutionary elements, who will benefit?
    Since there is no possibility of compromise with counter-revolutionary elements, we are only left with another path, that is, the people of the whole country unite under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, take action, and for the sake of the people's own safety and happiness, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionary bandits!
    In order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, the first thing that is needed is to heighten vigilance. Counter-revolutionary elements are able to lurk, even lurk in our government agencies, the People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, and are able to carry out their various harmful activities, to a large extent because our vigilance is not high. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement in 1951, a very dangerous sense of complacency and self-satisfaction grew among many people, thinking that counter-revolutionary elements had been suppressed almost completely and that the world was already at peace. This sense of complacency and self-satisfaction opened the door to convenience for the enemy. The personnel system of the agencies is not strict, making it easy for bad elements to sneak in and maintain their positions. The country's secrets, economic and technical essentials are not well protected, allowing the enemy to have opportunities to approach. There is a lack of vigilance against possible sabotage by the enemy, so that sometimes when the enemy's sabotage plan has already shown its head, it has not yet been discovered and necessary actions have not been taken. The public security departments have made many mistakes in this regard. The public security organs in many places have not resolutely suppressed the rampant activities of counter-revolutionary elements, causing the masses to complain: "Counter-revolutionaries want to restore, 'unlimited leniency' has also been restored!" In short, many comrades lack the concept of the enemy's situation, forget the existence of the enemy, forget or do not believe that the enemy is looking for our loopholes at any time and preparing to attack us. Because of this, these comrades actually deny the most basic principle of Marxism's class struggle, deny the most basic fact that revolution and counter-revolution cannot compromise in real politics, and therefore cannot help but make serious mistakes.
    In order to illustrate how politically paralyzed some of our comrades are, let me introduce here a piece of activity history of a counter-revolutionary political rogue.
    There was a Kuomintang member named Li Wanming, who served as a clerk and second lieutenant political officer in Jiang Kai-shek's 207th Division. He was from Ankang, Shaanxi, and is now 28 years old. In May 1949, Nanjing was liberated, and Li Wanming falsely claimed to be a student of Central University and infiltrated the Military and Political University of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. After graduating in October of the same year, he forged seals and infiltrated the Construction Section of the Changzhou Municipal Government as a staff member. He then forged seals again to cheat the then-Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released on parole in January 1951.
    This swindler became even more rampant after being released. He forged a letter of introduction from the Second Field Army to Shaanxi, posing as a veteran soldier transferring to a new job, and was actually introduced to the Ankang Prefectural Office by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. At this time, he also forged a certificate of Party membership and was believed to be true by the Prefectural Office Branch, so he not only fraudulently obtained the position of staff member of the Prefectural Office Civil Affairs Section and a certificate of disabled soldier, but also infiltrated the Communist Party. In October 1951, Li Wanming was sent to study at the Northwest Agricultural College in Wugong. Soon after, he came up with an even bigger scam, fabricating a resume of "having served as a company and battalion commander of the Red Army and a staff officer of a regiment of the Volunteer Army," and an order from the Organization Department of the Military and Political University of the Second Field Army for him to "report to the Central South Bureau." This ridiculous order was originally easy to see through, but the secretary of the Party General Branch Committee of the Northwest Agricultural College actually introduced him to the Northwest Bureau for transfer to the Central South Bureau, and the Organization Department of the Central South Bureau actually assigned him to the Central South Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, making him the secretary-director of the Central South Agricultural Science Research Institute. Later, due to his various lies and deceptions, he was promoted to deputy director of the Personnel Department and secretary of the Party General Branch Committee of the Central South Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and also married a female Communist Party member.
    In September 1953, this counter-revolutionary swindler was transferred to the Central Ministry of Forestry. The Ministry of Forestry planned to appoint him as the director of the Administration Department. He has not taken office because he is "sick and recuperating." Between November and December, he forged a telegram and a "personal letter" from a senior general, saying that a certain commander wanted him to "return to the 12th Army as chief of staff and commander of the 35th Division" and asked him to "take a plane to Lanzhou as soon as possible to discuss military affairs." The comrades in the Ministry of Forestry were really enthusiastic and bought him a plane ticket without thinking, so that he flew to Xi'an on January 3, 1955. He also found the original secretary of the Party General Branch Committee of the Northwest Agricultural College, and wanted to mess around there for another two months in order to cover up the current deception and create the next step of deception. But this time, this comrade, the secretary of the Party General Branch Committee, became vigilant. He discovered his flaws, and then he was arrested by the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department.
    Li Wanming's scams, to be sure, are naive and ridiculous, but in the half year of 1949 and the four years from January 1951 to January 1955, he ran through more than a dozen cities and broke into more than a dozen important agencies, and he actually fooled them all one by one. What a bitter irony this is for us! Where has the vigilance of many of our comrades gone? Are they sleeping? Some people still think that our vigilance is not low, and think that our loudly calling for raising vigilance now is meddling; then, please ask such comrades how to explain the occurrence of the Li Wanming incident? Are such comrades not exactly what counter-revolutionary elements such as Li Wanming are seeking?
    We must know that the Li Wanming incident is by no means an accidental and isolated "marvel." This is a manifestation of the paralysis and complacency of a large number of staff members in our state organs. It is precisely this paralysis and complacency that makes many counter-revolutionary elements dare to do whatever they want, killing and arson, as if they are in no man's land! I think that each of us should learn a lesson from this incident, and the public security departments should especially learn a lesson. I very much hope that China will also produce a Gogol, and put Li Wanming and the paralyzed elements who were deceived by Li Wanming on the stage, so that public security workers and all the people will always remember such a thing, like lying on firewood and tasting gall.
    The education of heightened vigilance must be carried out with concrete facts. Some people say: Why is the Communist Party publicizing the Hu Feng group so loudly? Isn't this making a mountain out of a molehill? No! This is not making a mountain out of a molehill, but tailoring clothes to fit. The exposure of the Hu Feng group is just right to educate the people and open the eyes of the people, so it is completely appropriate to publicize it loudly. We must constantly use the task of heightened revolutionary vigilance to educate Communist Party members, Youth League members, members of various democratic parties and people's organizations, all staff members of state organs, and the people of the whole country. Only in this way can we strictly enforce various systems, block various loopholes that can be used by counter-revolutionary elements, and promptly discover counter-revolutionary elements and eliminate them. This is the most important prerequisite for our elimination of counter-revolutionary elements.
    In order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and combine specialized work to protect public security with mass struggle. To struggle with counter-revolutionary elements of course requires specialized work, but the personnel of specialized work agencies are ultimately limited. They cannot know everything, let alone do everything. But with the cooperation of the masses, their position and strength are completely different. Everyone knows that the reason why the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement in 1951 achieved great results was mainly due to the strength of the people's masses. In the past few years, the cracking of many counter-revolutionary cases has also been the result of the assistance of the masses. After the masses have their eyes opened, they have a high degree of enthusiasm and unlimited wisdom, and it is difficult for hidden counter-revolutionary elements to remain hidden among such masses, so they are most afraid of the masses rising up to struggle with them. Recently, the staff members of various agencies and organizations have studied the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and their awareness and enthusiasm have been greatly improved. They have discovered many counter-revolutionary elements on the basis of investigation and research. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Trade found three special agents, one of whom, Wang Tong, developed three other special agents and attempted to establish reactionary armed forces. The Textile Bureau of the Local Industry Department found a counter-revolutionary element, Wang Yutian. This counter-revolutionary element not only harbored a special agent with blood debts for six years, but also, until the 8th and 25th of last month (June), individually reviewed and commented on all the staff members of the Textile Bureau and created a "blacklist" in preparation for arresting and questioning them one day! The masses in the Finance Department of the North China Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, because they had already grasped some materials about the counter-revolutionary suspect Qian Rongcan in the department on weekdays, made it impossible for him to continue to hide his true colors at a group meeting.
    Question: Why do you say that life was good in the Kuomintang era?
    Answer: I was the director of accounting on the Changxindian Railway, earning ten bags of foreign flour every month.
    Question: How did you get to Changxindian?
    Answer: I came by train on the Pinghan Road.
      Question: The Pinghan Road train was not open in 1945, how could you come?
    Answer: I came in August 1946. Question: Didn't you often say that you got married in Beijing in 1945?
      Answer: ...This...This...I need to think about it...
    In this way, Qian Rongcan could no longer answer. He had to confess that the resume he had said in the past was completely fabricated, and that he was originally a major officer in the Kuomintang Railway Corps.
      Obviously, if the masses are not mobilized, these dark corners will not be easily exposed, and counter-revolutionary bacteria will grow and become active inside, endangering our state organs and the safety of the people.
    We see from the previous examples that counter-revolutionary elements will exploit every opportunity, so the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements must be carried out in all organizations and among the people of the whole country. Some people say: We are too busy with our work to take care of it. The problem is that if you don't take care of rectifying counter-revolutionaries, counter-revolutionary elements can take care of rectifying you! Some people also say: Counter-revolutionary elements exist elsewhere, but not here with us. But almost all the departments where counter-revolutionary elements have been found originally thought that their departments were clean! Therefore, in order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, especially hidden counter-revolutionary elements, it is necessary to mobilize the masses universally and without exception.
    In order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, it is necessary to adhere to and implement correct policies. Heightened vigilance and mass mobilization are all correct policies. On this basis, it is also necessary to strictly draw a clear line between counter-revolutionary elements. Chairman Mao has put forward two slogans for us: "Heighten vigilance and eliminate all special agents; prevent deviations and do not wrong a single good person." This must become the guiding principle for all public security organs and the people of the whole country in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Public security organs must conduct full investigation and research on various counter-revolutionary cases, grasp detailed materials and accurate evidence, strictly abide by the Constitution and laws, prevent wrongful arrests, prevent "extracting confessions by torture," and ensure that both counter-revolutionary elements are hit and good people are protected.
    As mentioned earlier, the state's policy on dealing with counter-revolutionary elements is still to combine suppression and leniency. Our saying that we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, of course, does not mean to physically eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, but to prevent a single counter-revolutionary element from continuing to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Only a very small number of counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes need to be sentenced to death in accordance with the law. For the remaining counter-revolutionary criminals, most of them will be subjected to labor reform, so that they have the opportunity to become new people. This method has achieved remarkable results in the past few years. For those whose crimes are relatively minor, the method of on-site education will be adopted. We demand that all criminals frankly explain their crimes to the government and help the government find out the facts of other criminals. In this regard, our principle is: those who resist will be severely punished, those who confess will be treated leniently, and those who make meritorious service can offset their crimes. That is to say, in addition to

    全国人民团结起来，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子
    ——一九五五年七月二十七日在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    中华人民共和国国务院第一办公室主任兼公安部长　罗瑞卿
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    我想说一说我们实现社会主义建设计划的一个重要的保证——镇压反革命分子的活动。
    当全国人民欢欣鼓舞地为创造我们未来的幸福而奋斗的时候，反革命分子所进行的活动恰恰相反。他们千方百计地破坏人民的财产，破坏社会主义的建设，妄想颠覆中华人民共和国，使我国仍旧退回到被压迫的、落后的、穷困的半殖民地半封建时代。因此，要容忍反革命分子的活动，就不能安全地进行社会主义的建设；要安全地进行社会主义的建设，就不能容忍反革命分子的活动。
    我这样说，是否夸大了事实？那末，让我们从几个实例来看看最近时期反革命分子是怎样破坏着我们的建设吧。
    一九五四年一月，安徽芜湖纱厂被反革命分子纵火，烧毁二万三千多纱锭，损失一百六十余万元。
      一九五四年六月，沈阳建筑工程局第三分公司职员蒋匪特务田玉昆，放火烧掉工地材料仓库的全部建筑器材和三幢宿舍，并把救火的工地中共支部书记张殿龙同志打昏。
      一九五四年十月，上海石油批发站反革命分子龚阿宝，利用国庆节值班的机会偷将该站二○二号油池打开，使石油流入通黄浦江的河沟，企图引起严重火灾。幸亏河沟事前已被堵塞，未酿巨祸，但石油已被放走二千六百多斤。
      一九五四年十月，广州破获了一个以蒋匪特务吕薄冰为首的三十一名反革命分子的阴谋集团，这批反革命匪徒准备了铁锤、铁棒、石灰等凶器，计划伪装搭客，把民生轮船公司的民俗轮在航行途中劫往台湾。
      一九五五年六月，陕西朝邑县胜利农业生产合作社的麦场被反革命分子纵火，登场的一百多亩麦子全被焚毁。
    这些确凿无疑的事实，说明反革命分子对于我们的基本建设、工业、商业、运输业和农业，都在进行着疯狂的破坏。
    反革命分子有许多破坏是通过一定的技术来进行的。
      一九五四年三月，太原重型机器厂唯一的五吨大型汽锤，刚刚安装起来不久，就被反革命分子傅家邦故意借试锤的名义加以破坏。这个汽锤可以锻造十吨以上的锻件，每天可以创造一万元的财富。
    一九五四年三月，丰沙铁路二十号隧道发现顶部有巨大的空洞，工程师反革命分子董殿凯故意违反本人所熟知的施工规则，用废木料填塞，外涂灰浆，掩饰隐患，阴谋使隧道在通车的时候受震坍毁，企图造成难以预料的严重事故。
    一九五四年七月，河北下花园煤矿第一矿，由于副矿长兼主管技术员三青团分子李德厚，故意采取错误的采掘办法，使瓦斯大量积聚，发生爆炸，牺牲职员工人三十八人，中毒一百五十六人，直接损失财产五十余万元。
    一九五三年三月，某国防工厂助理工程师国民党分子张韵私改图纸，造成了废品和返修品八千四百件，装成的五百零九件武器试射时都不能准确发火。这不但是国家财产上的巨大损失，而且这种武器在战场上不能杀伤敌人，反而可能杀伤自己。
    我们全国的工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国的、善良的人们，为了发展生产，建设祖国，每一天，每一月，每一年，是付出了多少劳动，克服了多少困难啊！但是这些反革命强盗只要出一个坏主意，转眼之间就可以使多少宝贵的生命死亡，无数的财富化为灰烬。请看反革命分子为了破坏社会主义建设，凶恶毒辣到了怎样的程度！
    或者有人以为反革命分子破坏社会主义建设，是因为他们反对社会主义，反对社会主义的国家，他们对于普通人民也许并不反对吗？事实证明这种想法是错误的。例如一九五四年夏天武汉的防洪斗争，这是关系所有居民的安全的，反革命分子可以不加破坏了吧？但是有个原蒋匪少校军官七级技工李建勤，故意破坏修堤用的一吨推土机，使它七天不能推土。另一个国民党员地主分子电讯局技工王杰英，在市内抽水的紧急时机故意烧毁变电所的变压器，使六十部抽水机停车十八小时。这一类的破坏事故在六月下旬到八月下旬竟发生了一百多起，其他放信号弹、制造谣言、煽动民工逃跑、乘机捣乱市场、在制造防汛器材中掺假骗钱等事件还不在内。
    这些事实说明什么呢？这些事实说明，反革命分子在人民中间是绝对孤立的，他们同任何普通人都没有共同的利益。他们仇恨人民，仇恨人类，仇恨社会。“我几乎恨一切人”，胡风分子的这句话，代表了一切反革命分子的心理状态。
    反革命分子虽然是一些亡命的强盗，但是他们是受着帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮鼓励和指使的，因此他们的活动远不限于破坏建设。他们还在妄想颠覆中华人民共和国，实现反革命的复辟。
    反革命分子为了进行颠覆活动，竭力收买一些社会的败类参加他们的组织，并且用各种不同的名目来欺骗一些落后分子作他们的工具。据一九五四年河南、广东、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏、贵州、云南八省和上海市的不完全统计，共破获反革命集团案件八十三起，其中二十七起即有反革命分子一千零七十四名。香港蒋匪特务机关所谓“国民党中央执行委员会第二组”曾经给他们所派遣的一个特务分子许波平规定，发展到十五人，每月薪金港币一百元；发展到二十五人，每月二百元。这个匪徒在半年内果然发展了十九个特务。我们大家都知道，胡风反革命集团也就是按这种“争取人、联络人”的方针发展起来的。
    资产阶级中的不法分子为了抵抗社会主义改造而结成的一些秘密团体，在最近两年内比在“五反”时期是增加了，其中有些竟直接走上反革命的道路。例如一九五四年七月，上海祥泰锯木厂的老板周长明，竟纠合党羽，组织所谓“各界人民反共总会”，印发反革命传单。
      潜伏在宗教团体内的反革命分子，披着宗教活动的外衣，也在进行着发展反革命秘密组织的阴谋。一九五三年五月和一九五四年三月，河北献县地区和永年地区破获了两起利用天主教名义进行叛乱活动的秘密组织，仅地洞、暗室、夹壁墙就查出了一百几十处，最大的地洞可容一百多人。
    反动会道门也是反革命分子发展组织的一种重要方式。一九五五年一月，陕西省破获了一个“一贯道”化身的“中道”，仅反动道首就捕获了四百三十四名，挖出各式地洞、暗室一百零二处，缴获大批枪支、子弹、蒋匪党旗和其他反革命罪证。
    反革命分子的颠覆活动的重要内容之一是把我国许多机密情报偷送给敌人。
    例如：天津五达贸易行监理李芳五，在一九五四年七月亲去香港接受特务机关的训练和任务，负责给敌人调查中国人民解放军的番号、装备、调动，重工业厂矿的分布，通讯器材的管制状况等等；他不但利用自己的企业在天津成立“交通站”，而且还计划吸收他的哥哥和朋友在兰州和沈阳成立“交通分站”。
    上海东华园制梅厂经理徐孟奎，一九五一年去香港加入特务组织，同年回上海后，在一年多的时间内，即向香港特务机关用密写方法报告军事和政治情报十余次，军事情报包括海军船舰停泊情况等。
    蒋匪特务王砥中在一九五三年潜入广东，骗取了广东省建筑工程局设计公司技术员的职务，在半年中间给香港蒋匪特务机关送去了军事、政治、工程等情报二十多件，在工程情报中包括广州新建船坞的详细情报；此外，他还搜集了关于武汉造船厂、长江大桥等八项情报准备送出。
    美国中央情报局派遣的特务黎英，在一九五四年三月潜入广州，也在半年中间给香港美国特务机关送去了有关广州驻军、高射炮阵地、飞机场和粤汉铁路运输情况等情报二十多件。
    反革命分子在某些农村中认为有机可乘的时候还企图暴乱。
    例如浙江东阳县在一九五四年十二月，反革命分子纠合匪徒百余人，自称“剿共司令部”，分路攻打象岗乡和宅口乡的人民委员会，象岗乡的正副乡长都被捆绑砍伤，幸经县公安部队赶到救出。
    美国“自由中国运动总部”和蒋匪“总统府资料组”联合派遣的特务分子伍杰三在潜回安徽庐江家中后，就发展特务组织，搜集武器，企图利用一九五四年秋季水灾的机会，到大别山建立所谓“游击根据地”。
    一九五四年在山东菏泽出了七个“皇帝”，一九五五年三月又在河北张家口专区出了一个；这也是敌人组织暴乱的一种形式。
    反革命分子另一项突出的活动是凶杀和暗害。
    一九五五年二月二十八日，沈阳西郊大榆树村蔬菜生产合作社财务委员李景云全家八口，被三个反革命富农分子杀死。
    一九五五年五月三日，甘肃玉门原国民党区分部书记陈志荣，由于怀恨家人反对他的反革命活动并强令他劳动，竟在夜间杀死两个弟弟、弟媳、侄儿、侄女，砍伤妻子，又跑到乡人民委员会企图杀死乡长和中共支部书记。
    混入河北石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命分子原国民党区分部书记王丕昌等三人，在一九五二至一九五四年内故意制造多次医疗事故，造成残废二人，死亡十人，内有中共县委书记一人。他们甚至得意忘形地对院内的共产党员说：“你是共产党，我是国民党，你说怎办就怎办吧。”
    但是反革命分子并不以杀害少数人为满足。一九五四年国庆节前夜，蒋匪保密局曾派它的行动处副处长姚恺如到香港，布置一个对广州的大规模的爆炸。姚匪从一九五四年六月起，就个别地选择、训练和派遣了特务十二名，完全由姚匪个别地指挥，个别地分配任务和供给炸药。这伙匪徒们所领到的爆破器材有美制烈性炸药、燃烧药、雷管等五十四盒。匪徒们计划在一九五四年国庆节实行爆炸，目标有国庆节的纪念会场、游行队伍、戏院、茶楼、工厂、仓库、油库、车站、桥梁、兵营、飞机场、政府机关等。
    反革命分子的罪恶是说不完的。但是我想，从刚才举出的这些例子，已经可以看出他们的狰狞的面目了。
    各位代表！对于这批穷凶极恶、灭绝人性的反革命匪徒，我们在座的任何人还能够加以容忍吗？任何善良的中国人，任何希望中国国家富强，社会进步，甚至只希望自己安居乐业的中国人，对于这批匪徒的滔天罪恶，还能够无动于中吗？任何人听了这样骇人听闻的阴谋，还能够认为反革命分子不过是“几条泥鳅掀不起大浪”，因而安慰自己吗？
    或者有人要问，在中华人民共和国成立以后，已经进行过大规模的镇压反革命运动和多次的社会改革运动，在这些运动中已经镇压了大批的反革命分子，为什么目前还有这样多反革命分子在活动呢？
    毫无疑问，从镇压反革命运动和各种社会改革运动以后，反革命分子的活动已经受到了极大的打击，人民民主专政已经得到了极大的巩固。由于政府和人民群众的共同努力，反革命分子的阴谋活动，大部分在事前就受到了制止，一部分已经造成的破坏事件，一般地也能迅速破案。仅在一九五四年内，破获的特务间谍案件即达六百一十九起。但是我们决不能因此而自满。如上所说，反革命分子仍然造成了不少严重的破坏；而尤其重要的是，还有大批的反革命分子还在潜伏着，准备着制造更多的破坏。
    当然，反革命分子在全国人口中只占极少数，愈往后还要愈少。但是在我们这样的六万万人口的大国里，反革命分子究竟不止几百个几千个。大家知道，反革命分子的唯一前途就是灭亡；但是我们也不能设想他们会在短时间内完全消灭。这是因为：
    第一，我们要记着，只在六年以前，我国的大部分土地还是由反革命势力统治着的，反革命多年的统治所留下的垃圾是不可能一下子完全扫清的。
    第二，我们也要记着，反革命统治在我国大陆上虽然被彻底推翻了，但是蒋介石匪帮还在美帝国主义的保护下盘据着台湾，帝国主义还在包围着我们，我国内部的反革命分子还在受着帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的支持。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊曾在一九五五年二月十日美国众议院拨款委员会明目张胆地作证说：“我们所希望的解决中国大陆问题的办法……是用促成内部瓦解的行动。”在美国政府的每年预算内，就公开地规定着专用于颠覆社会主义阵营各国的一亿美元的经费，其中并有五千万美元政府可以秘密使用，而不向国会报告。美国在我国周围设立了大批的间谍组织。很明显，他们的方针不是白定的，他们的钱不是白花的，他们的组织不是白设的。至于蒋介石匪帮进行特务活动所用的力量，更是大家所知道的了。
    第三，我们还要记着，我国正处在阶级斗争剧烈的过渡时期。过去的未被镇压的反革命分子，或虽已判刑而已期满释放的反革命分子，在土地改革中受到打击的地主阶级分子，以及其他因为贪污、盗窃、伤害人命等各种罪行而受到正义的打击的分子，有许多人并没有就此安分守己，还在图谋报复；而在社会主义改造过程中，又有一部分资产阶级分子和富农分子拒绝改造，图谋反抗。
    这样，就使得镇压反革命的斗争成为一个相当长时期的斗争。只要国内的阶级还存在，国外的帝国主义还存在，镇压反革命的斗争也就必然要存在。
    一九五一年的镇压反革命运动得到了伟大的成绩，但是我们应该看到，那次运动的主要锋芒是对着公开的反革命分子，暗藏的反革命分子被发现和镇压的并不多，而敌人今天的主要活动方式却是暗藏的。由于中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府得到了广大人民群众的爱戴拥护，反革命分子在多数情形下不得不把自己伪装起来，以便于保护自己，并且力求钻到共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、政府机关和人民解放军内部来进行破坏。前面所举的一些反革命活动的事例，大部分都是暗藏的反革命分子所进行的。胡风反革命集团分子伪装进步作家，其中有不少人还钻进了共产党的组织，这是我们所已经知道的了。反革命分子甚至还钻到党的领导部门以至公安部门中来。上海市前副市长潘汉年长期间同敌人的特务机关相勾结。前上海市公安局长杨帆，在共产党叛徒饶漱石和潘汉年共同指使下，背着中央，包庇、掩护和任用了大批的特务分子和反革命分子，使蒋匪特务机关的活动得到了护身符。各种暗藏的反革命分子在过去的镇压反革命运动中还没有受到充分的打击，这是反革命活动在最近期间显得嚣张的一个重要原因。
    反革命分子这样嚣张地活动，我们究竟应该采取什么办法来对待呢？我们有两条道路可以选择。
    一条是同他们妥协，实行和平共处。但是这一条他们不赞成，他们不肯跟我们和平共处。反革命分子的宗旨就是要消灭我们。有人说：应当对反革命分子宽大些，应当给他们出路。但是事实是相反的。我们对反革命分子历来实行镇压和宽大相结合的政策，今后也仍然要实行这个政策，反革命分子是懂得这一点的。而那些坚决的反革命分子并不因为宽大而受到感动，反而常常利用我们的过分宽大来作恶。前面说过的三青团分子李德厚，在一九五○年就曾因为瓦斯爆炸，被判处徒刑二年，缓期执行，在缓刑期满后被提升为副矿长。这还不算宽大吗？他还没有出路吗？他受了感动没有呢？他的“感动”的表现，就是再一次制造伤亡一百九十四人的爆炸！又有人说：反革命分子所以活动，还是因为我们工作中有缺点。但是人民看我们工作中的缺点和反革命分子看我们工作中的缺点是完全两样的，人民认为我们对反革命分子镇压得不坚决是最大的缺点，反革命分子却认为我们不让他们有反革命的自由是最大的缺点。玉门的反革命分子陈志荣把自己一家人都杀了，因为他家里人不要他继续反革命，这难道能说是他家里人有缺点吗？那批在广州准备爆炸的特务并没有人去惹他们，可是他们却企图把广州人大批地炸死；那批暗藏在武汉防洪组织内的特务也没有人去惹他们，可是他们却企图把武汉人大批地淹死。大家请看，同反革命分子还能有什么和平共处呢？如果宣传同反革命分子和平共处，那究竟是对谁有利呢？
    同反革命分子既然没有妥协的可能，在我们面前就只剩下另一条道路，这就是全国人民在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下团结起来，行动起来，为人民自己的安全和幸福，把一切反革命匪徒坚决、彻底、干净、全部地加以肃清！
    为了肃清反革命分子，首先需要提高警惕。反革命分子能够暗藏下来，甚至暗藏到我们的政府机关、人民解放军、共产党、各民主党派和各人民团体中间，能够进行他们的各种危害活动，在很大的程度上都是由于我们的警惕性不高。在一九五一年镇压反革命运动以后，在许多人中间生长了一种极危险的麻痹自满情绪，以为反革命分子已经镇压得差不多了，天下已经太平了，这种麻痹自满情绪给敌人开了方便之门。机关用人制度不严，使坏分子容易钻进来并保持他的职位。国家的机密、经济上和技术上的要害保护得不好，让敌人有接近的机会。对敌人可能的破坏缺少戒心，以至有时在敌人的破坏计划已经露头的时候，还没有发觉和采取必要的行动。公安部门在这个方面犯过许多错误。许多地方的公安机关对于反革命分子的猖狂活动没有坚决镇压，引起群众抱怨说：“反革命想复辟，‘宽大无边’是不是也复辟了！”总之，许多同志缺少敌情观念，忘记了敌人的存在，忘记了或者不相信敌人随时随地都在找我们的空子准备袭击我们。因为这样，这些同志就在实际上否认了马克思主义的阶级斗争这一条最基本的原理，否认了现实政治中革命和反革命不能妥协这一种最基本的事实，因而不能不犯严重的错误。
    为了说明我们有些同志在政治上麻痹到什么程度，让我在这里介绍一段反革命政治流氓的活动史。
    有一个国民党员李万铭，历充蒋匪军二○七师文书、准尉政治干事，陕西安康人，现年二十八岁。一九四九年五月南京解放，李万铭伪称中央大学学生，混入人民解放军第二野战军军政大学学习。同年十月毕业后，伪造印信，混入常州市政府建设科任科员。随后又伪造印信到当时的苏南行政公署撞骗，被判处徒刑三年。一九五一年一月假释出狱。
    这个骗子被释放以后更猖狂了。他伪造了第二野战军的介绍信到陕西，冒称是荣誉军人转业，居然被陕西省民政厅介绍给安康专署。这时他又伪造了党籍的证明信，并且被专署机关支部信以为真，因而不但骗取了专署民政科科员的职位和残废军人的证章，而且混进了共产党内。一九五一年十月，李万铭被派赴武功西北农学院学习。随后不久，他又想出更大的骗局，捏造了一个“历任红军连、营长和志愿军团参谋长”的履历，和第二野战军军政大学组织部要他“到中南局报到”的命令。这个荒唐的命令本来是容易识破的，但西北农学院党总支委书记竟当真给他介绍到西北局转中南局，而中南局组织部也竟分配他到中南农林部，使他担任了中南农业科学研究所的秘书主任。以后又由于他的种种谎骗，升任中南农林部人事处副处长，党总支委书记，并且同一个女共产党员结了婚。
    一九五三年九月，这个反革命骗子被调来中央林业部，林业部拟任为行政处长，他因为“患病休养”，尚未到职。在十一月和十二月间，他伪造了一位高级将领给他的电报和“亲笔信”，说是某司令员要他“回十二军任参谋长兼三十五师师长”，并要他“火速乘飞机去兰州商谈军务”。林业部的同志真热心，毫不思索就给他买了飞机票，使他在一九五五年一月三日飞到了西安。他又找到原来的西北农学院党总支委书记，还想再到那里去鬼混两个月，以便弥缝眼前的欺骗，制造下一步的欺骗。但是这一次这位党总支委书记同志警觉起来了，他发现了他的马脚，这才由陕西省公安厅加以逮捕。
    李万铭的骗术，说来是幼稚可笑的，但是他在
  一九四九年的半年中和一九五一年一月到一九五五年一月的四年中，跑过十几个城市，闯过十几个重要机关，竟然都一一蒙混过去了。这对我们是一个多么辛辣的讽刺！我们的许多同志的警惕性究竟到哪里去了呢？不是在睡觉吗？有些人到现在还认为我们的警惕性并不低，认为现在我们大声疾呼地要求提高警惕性是多事；那末，请问这样的同志怎样来解释李万铭事件的发生呢？这样的同志难道不正是李万铭等反革命分子所求之不得的吗？
    我们要知道，李万铭事件决不是一件什么偶然的和孤立的“奇闻”，这是我们国家机关大批工作人员麻痹自满的表现，正是这种麻痹自满使许多反革命分子敢于为非作歹，杀人放火，如入无人之境！我想我们每个人都应该从这个事件得到教训，而公安部门尤其应该得到教训。我很希望我们中国也出
  一个果戈里，把李万铭以及被李万铭欺骗的麻痹分子搬到舞台上来，使公安工作者和全体人民都永远记住这样一件事，好比卧薪尝胆一般。
    提高警惕性的教育必须用具体的事实来进行。有人说：共产党为什么对胡风集团这样大张旗鼓地宣传呢？这不是小题大做吗？不是的！这不是小题大做，而是量体裁衣。胡风集团的揭露，正好用来教育人民，把人民的眼睛擦亮，因此，加以大张旗鼓地宣传是完全合乎时宜的。我们必须时时刻刻用提高革命警惕性的任务来教育共产党员、青年团员，教育各民主党派各人民团体的成员，教育国家机关的全体工作人员，教育全国人民。只有这样，我们才能严密各种制度，堵塞各种可以给反革命分子利用的漏洞，才能及时地发现反革命分子而加以肃清。这是我们肃清反革命分子的最重要的前提。
    为了肃清反革命分子，必须发动群众，使保卫治安的专门工作同群众斗争相结合。同反革命分子作斗争当然需要专门的工作，但是专门工作机关的人员究竟是有限的，他们不可能知道每一件事情，更不可能做到每一件事情。但是有了群众的合作，他们的地位和力量就完全不同了。大家知道，一九五一年的镇压反革命运动所以得到伟大的成绩，主要地就是由于人民群众的力量。过去几年中，许多反革命案件的破获，也是群众协助的结果。群众在眼睛亮起来以后有很高的积极性和无限的智慧，暗藏的反革命分子在这样的群众中间就很难暗藏下去，因此他们最怕群众起来同他们斗争。最近各机关团体的工作人员学习了关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，觉悟性和积极性大大提高了，在调查研究的基础上发现了不少的反革命分子。例如：对外贸易部查出了三个特务，其中一个特务王桐另外又发展了三个特务，并企图建立反动武装。地方工业部纺织局查出了一个反革命分子汪雨田，这个反革命分子不但窝藏了一个有血债的特务达六年之久，而且直到上月（六月）八日和二十五日，还把纺织局的全体工作人员一一加以评点，列了一个准备有朝一日逮捕问罪的“黑名单”！建筑工程部华北工程管理局财务处的群众，由于平日对该处的反革命嫌疑分子钱荣灿已经掌握了若干材料，所以在一次小组会上就使他无法继续隐藏自己的本来面目。
    问：你为什么说国民党时代生活好？
    答：我在长辛店铁路上当会计主任，每月赚十袋洋面。
    问：你怎么到的长辛店？
    答：坐平汉路火车来的。
      问：一九四五年平汉路火车不通你怎么能来？
    答：我是一九四六年八月来的。问：你平日不是常说一九四五年在北京结的婚吗？
      答：……这个……这个……我要想一想……
    就这样，钱荣灿再也答不上来了。他只好招认他过去所说的履历完全是捏造的，他原来是国民党铁道兵团的少校军官。
      很明显，如果不是发动群众，这些黑暗的角落就不容易暴露，而反革命的细菌就会在里面滋长活动起来，危害我们的国家机关和人民的安全。
    我们从前面的实例看到，反革命分子是有空必钻的，因此反对反革命分子的斗争必须在所有的组织中和全国人民中开展起来。有人说：我们的业务太忙，顾不上。问题是你顾不上整反革命，反革命分子可是顾得上来整你呀！又有人说：反革命分子在别处是有的，在我们这里没有。可是几乎所有查出反革命分子的部门，原来也都以为自己的部门是干净的呀！因此，为了肃清反革命分子，特别是暗藏的反革命分子，必须把群众普遍地无例外地发动起来。
    为了肃清反革命分子，必须坚持贯彻正确的政策。提高警惕性，发动群众，这些都是正确的政策。在这个基础上，还必须严格划清反革命分子的界限。毛主席给我们提出这样两句口号：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人。”这必须成为全国公安机关以及全国人民在镇压反革命斗争中的指南针。公安机关对于各种反革命案情必须进行充分的调查研究，掌握详细的材料和确切的证据，严格地遵守宪法和法律，防止错捕人，防止“逼供信”，做到既打击了反革命分子，又保护了好人。
    前面已经说过，国家在处理反革命分子问题上的政策，仍然是镇压和宽大相结合。我们所说的坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子，当然不是说把一切反革命分子在肉体上消灭掉，而是说不让一个反革命分子继续进行反革命活动。只有极少数罪大恶极的反革命分子才需要依法处以极刑。对于其余的反革命罪犯，大部分将实行劳动改造，使他们有重新做人的机会，这个办法在过去几年中已经卓著成效。对于罪恶比较轻微的人，则将采取就地教育的方法。我们要求一切犯罪分子向政府坦白地说明自己的罪过，并且帮助政府查清其他犯罪分子的事实。在这一方面，我们的原则是：抗拒者从严，坦白者从宽，立功者可以将功折罪。这就是说，除了犯罪者的犯罪情节轻重以外，我们还将根据他们在犯罪以后的表现，分别地决定给以严肃而又适当的处理。
    各位代表！在我们伟大的祖国里，随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，随着镇压反革命的斗争的发展，人民的革命力量是在一天一天地不断地加强，而人民的敌人则是在一天一天地不断地被消灭。帝国主义者和蒋匪帮在过去每年都梦想他们在中国还有点什么“希望”，但是每年他们都得到一个失望。当我们这次镇压反革命分子特别是镇压暗藏的反革命分子的群众斗争在共产党和人民政府的坚强领导下广泛地展开并获得胜利以后，他们的“希望”更将受到前所未有的打击。但是我们要永远不自满，永远保持警惕。让我们全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体一致团结起来，我们一定要在警惕中进行我们伟大的社会主义建设，并且完成我们伟大的社会主义建设！
