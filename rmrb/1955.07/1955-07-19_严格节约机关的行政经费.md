    Strictly Economize on Administrative Expenses of Government Organs
    In order to realize our country's first Five-Year Plan, the staff of our state organs, institutions, and enterprises, in addition to doing their own professional work well, must strive to overcome all waste, save administrative expenses, and increase the accumulation of funds for socialist industrialization.
    The decisive measures for saving administrative expenses and improving the work of government organs are streamlining organizations and consolidating staffing. At present, the reorganization of organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has come to an end, with preliminary plans to reduce more than 47 percent of the original staff. The ministries, commissions, and directly affiliated organs of the State Council have initially reduced the original number of personnel by more than 40 percent, and are actively continuing the reorganization. While streamlining organizations and consolidating staffing, we must also pay close attention to eliminating extravagance and waste in government organs, promote the tradition of hard work and plain living, and universally establish a frugal and simple style. This is also an important way to save administrative expenses. Although the proportion of state administrative management expenses in the total state expenditure has decreased year by year in recent years, from 19.3 percent in 1950 to 7.54 percent in 1955, the amount of waste in administrative expenses of government organs is still very large and strict economy must be practiced.
    It is well known that many state organs, institutions, and enterprises have serious waste in the construction of offices, dormitories, auditoriums, and clubs. Along with the construction of luxurious houses, the interior furnishings have also become extravagant, with beautiful desks, leather sofas, spring chairs, expensive carpets, velvet curtains and tablecloths, radios, tape recorders, etc., becoming more and more complete and luxurious. The purchase of cars has also greatly exceeded regulations. In the capital, the central-level administrative organs alone have more than 500 large cars and more than 1,900 small cars. At present, many government organs are replacing large trucks with large sedans. Some responsible staff members of government organs like to have the latest model limousines and are unwilling to ride in older cars. Even if the original cars are very good, they still want to replace them with better ones. As everyone knows, our country cannot produce cars yet, and buying cars requires foreign exchange; at the same time, adding a car means adding a driver, increasing gasoline expenses and repair costs. A careful calculation shows that each additional small car costs an additional 3,500 yuan per year just for vehicle depreciation, maintenance, repairs, fuel consumption, driver wages, and miscellaneous expenses.
    The waste in operating expenses of some government organs is also very large. Especially for state organs at the provincial level and above, many meetings are held every year. Many meetings are often delayed from five days to ten days, or from half a month to a month, due to inadequate preparation and planning. The number of participants in the meetings, which should not have been increased, has increased. Some meetings that should not have been held were even convened. For example, the Ministry of Railways held a total of 142 professional meetings and the Ministry of Commerce held 112 professional meetings in 1954, which involved a lot of waste. At the same time, cigarettes, candies, banquets, meals, park visits, theater visits, and movie screenings during the meetings are even more common. Some meetings also issue commemorative albums and commemorative medals, and take group photos. This, of course, wastes a lot of funds. As for the excessive extravagance of many commemorative meetings and celebrations, the phenomenon is also very serious. The waste of office expenses in many government organs is also very large. Paper and stationery are supplied almost without limit and used arbitrarily; the use of long-distance telephone and telegrams is also unlimited; reports and documents are printed and distributed excessively; electricity and water are used wastefully; and there are other daily waste facts that seem small but are actually very large.
    It should be recognized that extravagance, waste, luxury, enjoyment, and arbitrary squandering are manifestations of the bourgeois ideology and style. Diligence, bravery, hard work, and plain living are the fine traditions of the Chinese working people and the Chinese Communists. Some of our staff members of government organs, after the national victory, forgot the tradition of hard work and plain living, were corrupted by the bourgeois ideology, and became infected with the bad habit of luxury and enjoyment. They say that the past hardship was determined by the environment, and now that there are conditions, it should be "improved." Of course, in the past, due to the enemy's blockade and "mopping-up operations," sometimes our staff members lacked even the minimum food and clothing; now that the country has won a complete victory, generally speaking, there will no longer be such situations, and with the restoration and development of the national economy, the living conditions and welfare of staff members have been significantly improved. However, it must be very clear that the current "conditions" are still limited, and the current "improvement" must also be limited. Because the country's economy and production are still very backward, we must use the main economic forces to build heavy industry, and the improvement of living standards must be adapted to economic development. The current so-called "conditions for improvement" can only be an improvement over the past very difficult environment, and "improvement" must never be the pursuit of the bourgeois lifestyle. Sitting in a car for work needs is much better than walking or riding a horse, and we should not want the most expensive cars and waste national resources. We now have stable offices to sit down and work, which is much better than running around with document bags, holding meetings in the open air, and writing on our laps, and we should not build luxurious houses and furnish the rooms lavishly, wasting national resources. There is no limit to enjoyment. If this bourgeois ideology and style is not corrected, it will develop, and even lead some people to the road of corruption and degeneration.
    Some people want to catch up with the level of Soviet socialism, which has been built for more than 30 years, in terms of living standards and welfare. They forget that our country's most important historical mission at present is to start building socialism and start building heavy industry. They forget the arduousness of this construction process. Stalin recalled the situation at the beginning of the Soviet construction in 1935, saying that it is necessary to "be willing to bear sacrifices, practice extreme economy in all aspects, save food, save education funds, save cloth, in order to accumulate the funds necessary to create industry." Our country's economic conditions and economic foundation are more backward than when the Soviet Union started construction. Therefore, we should learn from the example of the Soviet people who worked hard for the construction of socialism at that time in building socialism. As early as on the eve of the national victory, the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China taught us: Winning the national victory is only the first step in the Long March. The road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the work is more arduous. All comrades of the Party must continue to maintain the style of humility, prudence, freedom from arrogance, and freedom from impatience, and must continue to maintain the style of hard work. We should follow this instruction of the Party Central Committee, carry forward our past tradition of hard work, and learn from the spirit of thrift in Soviet construction. In order to build our motherland faster, we must strive to learn advanced Soviet production technology in production and construction, and strive to learn advanced Soviet work experience in the work of government organs. It is very appropriate and necessary to strive to learn from the Soviet Union in production and work; however, in terms of life and welfare, we should learn from the spirit of hard work and plain living of the Soviet people during the first Five-Year Plan period; in this regard, we must never "catch up," and should not imitate the happy life that the Soviet Union has achieved after many years of construction. We must strive to save in all aspects and oppose all extravagance and waste.
    Some people think that government organs do not spend much money, and saving does not save much, and the role is not great; to save, the main thing is still in production and construction. In fact, a lot of funds can be saved in this regard. If we save 1 percent of this year's national administrative management budget, it will be more than 22.4 million yuan. This number is also not small. It can be seen that those who say these things do not really understand the significance of saving administrative expenses of government organs. They do not understand that saving the administrative expenses of state organs, institutions, and enterprises is not only an indispensable method for accumulating funds for socialist industrialization, but also a key to promoting the tradition of hard work and plain living and universally establishing a style of hard work and plain living; only in this way can we unite the masses more closely and complete the great cause. In establishing a style of hard work and plain living, leading organs at all levels and leading comrades at all levels should set an example and set a good example. Recently, the State Council has stipulated new standards for the cost of office and dormitory construction, stipulated that sofas and carpets are not allowed to be bought, and stipulated that no refreshments are allowed except tea at meetings. The State Council and various ministries and commissions have recently begun to implement these regulations. This meeting of the National People's Congress has canceled refreshments such as cigarettes, fruits, snacks, daily necessities, and sightseeing, and the average daily cost per delegate is estimated to be reduced by nearly half compared with last year, which will greatly promote the establishment of a frugal style throughout the country.
    In the struggle to save administrative expenses of government organs and oppose all waste, a strict financial management system is of decisive significance. In the past, the emergence of various wasteful phenomena was also an important reason for the lack of a strict financial system. Therefore, when the Central Committee put forward the need to practice comprehensive economy and overcome all waste, it is very necessary for the organs in charge of finance to put forward the standards of various expenses, formulate various systems, and strictly manage the financial work of various government organs. All staff members of state organs, institutions, and enterprises must be mobilized to strictly abide by the financial system, expose all kinds of wasteful phenomena in government organs, and think of various ways to overcome all waste, save all administrative expenses that can be saved, and strive to ensure the full realization of the Five-Year Plan!

### 严格节约机关的行政经费

    严格节约机关的行政经费
    为了实现我国第一个五年计划，我们国家机关、事业机关和企业机关的工作人员除了应该作好本身的业务工作以外，必须努力克服一切浪费，节省机关的行政经费，增加社会主义工业化资金的积累。
    节省机关行政经费和改进机关工作的决定性的措施是精简机构和整顿编制。目前，中共中央直属机关的整编工作已告一段落，初步计划从原编制人员中减少百分之四十七以上。国务院各部、会和直属机关已初步减少了原有人数的百分之四十以上，并且正在积极地继续进行整编。在精简机构和整顿编制的同时，我们还必须十分注意消除机关中的铺张浪费现象，发扬艰苦奋斗的传统，普遍树立节约朴素的风气。这也是节省机关行政经费的一个重要办法。几年来国家行政管理费的开支，在国家整个支出中的比重虽然是逐年降低的，它已由一九五○年的百分之十九点三降低为一九五五年的百分之七点五四，但是目前机关行政经费开支上的浪费数目还是很大，还必须厉行严格的节约。
    不少国家机关、事业机关和企业机关在修建办公室、宿舍、礼堂、俱乐部等方面有着严重的浪费，这是人所共知的。而随着豪华房子的建筑，室内陈设也阔绰起来，漂亮的写字台、皮沙发、弹簧椅子、高贵的地毯、丝绒的窗帘和台布、收音机、录音机等等，越来越齐全，越来越华丽。汽车的购置也大大超过规定。在首都仅中央一级的行政机关就有大汽车五百多辆，小汽车一千九百多辆。目前很多机关的大卡车都换为大轿车。有些机关的负责工作人员喜欢要最新式的卧车，不愿意坐旧式汽车，甚至原有的汽车已经很好，还想换更好的。大家知道，我国目前还不能生产汽车，买汽车就要用外汇；同时增加一辆汽车，就要增加司机，增加汽油开支和修理费，仔细一算账，每增加一辆小汽车仅车辆的损耗、保养、修理、用油及司机工资和杂支等费用，每年就要多开支三千五百元。
    若干机关在事业费的开支上浪费也是很大的。特别是省级以上的国家机关，每年都要开很多次会议。而许多会议，往往由于准备和计划不周，本应开五天的拖延至十天，本应开半月的拖延至一个月，参加会议的人数本来不必增多的却增多了，有的甚至不应召开的也召开了。如一九五四年铁道部共召开了一百四十二次专业会议，商业部召开了一百一十二次专业会议，这中间就存在不少浪费。同时在会议中的纸烟、糖果以及请客、会餐、游园、看戏、看电影更是普遍的现象。有的会议还发纪念册和纪念章、照团体像。这样，当然大量浪费了经费。至于不少纪念大会、庆祝大会过分铺张的现象也是很严重的。很多机关的办公费的浪费也很大。纸张文具几乎无限制地供给和任意地使用；长途电话和电报的使用也漫无限制；表报文件滥印滥发；用电用水大手大脚；还有其他日常的浪费事实看起来很小而实际上是很大的。
    应该认识，铺张浪费、讲豪华、好享受、任意挥霍，是资产阶级思想作风的表现。而勤劳、勇敢、艰苦、朴素却是中国劳动人民和中国共产党人的优良传统。我们有些机关工作人员，在全国胜利以后，忘掉了艰苦朴素的传统，受到了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，沾染上讲豪华、好享受的恶劣作风，他们说什么：过去艰苦是环境决定，现在有条件应该“改善”。当然，过去由于敌人的封锁和“扫荡”，有时我们的工作人员连最低的衣食都缺乏；现在全国胜利了，一般地说不会再有那样的情况，而且随着国家经济的恢复和发展，工作人员的生活福利都有显著的改善。但是必须十分清楚地认识到：现在的
  “条件”还是有限度的，现在的“改善”也必须是有限度的。因为国家的经济和生产还很落后，我们要把主要经济力量用在建设重工业，生活改善必须和经济发展相适应。现在的所谓“有条件改善”，只能是比过去十分艰苦的环境有所改善，而且“改善”也决不是追求资产阶级的生活方式。因工作需要而坐汽车，这比过去步行、骑马已改善很多，决不应该还要最名贵的汽车，浪费国家资财。我们现在有安定的办公室坐下来办公，这比过去背着文件包东跑西跑，露天开会、伏在腿上写字的情况，也已改善了很多，决不应该再把房子造得很豪华，屋子里陈设得很阔绰，浪费国家资财。享受是没有止境的，这种资产阶级的思想和作风不纠正，它就会发展起来，以至使某些人走向腐化堕落的道路。
    有些人想在生活福利上迎头赶上已经建设了三十多年的苏联社会主义水平，他们忘掉了我国当前最重要的历史使命是开始建设社会主义，开始建设重工业，他们忘掉了这个建设过程的艰苦性。斯大林在一九三五年回忆苏联建设开始时的情形说，必须“甘愿担受牺牲，在各方面实行极端节省，节省饮食，节省教育经费，节省布匹，以求积累创立工业所必要的资金。”我国的经济条件和经济基础比苏联开始建设时还落后，因此我们建设社会主义更应该学习苏联人民当时为了建设社会主义而艰苦奋斗的榜样。早在全国胜利的前夕，中国共产党第七届二中全会的决议就曾教导我们：夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦；全党同志必须继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，必须继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们应当遵照党中央的这个指示，发扬我们过去艰苦奋斗的传统，学习苏联建设中的节俭精神。为了更快地建设我们的祖国，在生产建设上要努力学习苏联先进生产技术，在机关工作上要努力学习苏联先进工作经验，从生产上和工作上努力向苏联看齐，这是十分应当而必要的；然而在生活和福利方面，却应该学习苏联人民在第一个五年计划时期的艰苦朴素的作风；在这方面绝对不能“迎头赶上”，不应在现在就去模仿苏联建设多年才达到的幸福生活。我们必须从各方面力求节省，反对一切铺张浪费。
    有些人认为：机关花钱不多，节省也节省不了多少，作用不大；要节约主要还是在生产建设方面。事实上，在这方面也是可以节省很多经费的。如果节省今年的国家行政管理费预算的百分之一，就是二千二百四十多万元。这数目也很不小。可见，说这些话的人还不真正了解节省机关行政经费的意义。他们不了解节省国家机关、事业机关和企业机关的行政经费，不只是积累社会主义工业化资金的一种不可少的方法，而且还是发扬艰苦朴素的传统、普遍树立艰苦朴素的风气的关键；只有这样，我们才能更紧密地团结群众，完成伟大的事业。而在树立艰苦朴素的风气方面，各级领导机关和各级领导同志更应以身作则，树立良好榜样。最近，国务院在关于机关节约方面，已经规定出办公室和宿舍建筑造价的新标准，规定不许买沙发地毯，规定开会除茶水以外不许作任何招待，国务院和各部委最近已经按照这些规定开始实行。这次全国人民代表大会开会，就取消了纸烟、水果、点心、日用品、游览等招待，每个代表平均每天的费用比去年估计要减少将近一半，这对于全国树立节约风气就将起很大的推动作用。
    在节约机关行政经费、反对一切浪费的斗争中，严格财务管理制度是有决定意义的。过去各种浪费现象的出现，没有严格的财务制度也是一个重要原因。因此，当中央提出厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费的时候，各主管财政的机关相应地提出各种费用的标准，订出各种制度，并把各机关的财务工作严格地管理起来是十分必要的。国家机关、事业机关和企业机关的全体工作人员必须动员起来，严格遵守财务制度，揭发机关中的各种浪费现象，想出各种办法来克服一切浪费，节省一切可以节省的行政经费，为保证五年计划的全部实现而奋斗！
