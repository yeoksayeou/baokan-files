    Soviet Steel Plants Across the Country Promote Oxygen Blast Method
    Annual Steel Production Can Increase by More Than Ten Million Tons

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Steel factories across the Soviet Union are widely adopting oxygen blast methods in their blast furnace and open-hearth furnace workshops to strengthen the metal smelting process and increase steel production. Dozens of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces will be converted to oxygen blasting this year alone. Many steel plants in the Urals, Siberia, Donbas, and Dnieper River Basin are building new oxygen stations.

    The use of oxygen blasting is of great significance in increasing steel production. It is estimated that the adoption of oxygen blasting in existing blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces throughout the Soviet Union will increase the annual steel production by more than ten million tons in the near future. Many large Soviet steel enterprises, such as the Zaporozhye Steel Plant, the Electric Steel Factory, and the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" Steel Factory, have increased the productivity of their blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces by 15 to 20 percent in the past year and a half to two years due to the use of this method.

    The experience of the "Zaporozhye Steel Plant," the largest in the European part of the Soviet Union, is particularly rich in this regard. In the first year alone, the No. 10 open-hearth furnace of this plant produced 32,000 tons more steel than when oxygen was not used, and the smelting time per furnace was shortened by two hours. This open-hearth furnace smelted 568 furnaces of steel between two major overhauls, which was 144 furnaces more than the average steel smelting volume of other open-hearth furnaces. Recently, the open-hearth furnace workers of the factory increased the proportion of oxygen in the hot air sent into the open-hearth furnace to 30 percent and increased the thermal load of the open-hearth furnace to 32 million kilocalories per hour. As a result, the smelting time for one furnace of steel has been further shortened to six hours. Four furnaces of steel can be smelted in one day and night.

    The practice of this factory overturned the argument that the use of oxygen would greatly reduce the life of the open-hearth furnace. Before the use of oxygen, the chrome-magnesia brick roof of the factory could only smelt an average of 417 furnaces of steel before being damaged. However, when oxygen was used in 1953, the open-hearth furnace roof smelted an average of 427 furnaces before requiring repair. The chrome-magnesia brick roof and oxygen overcame the so-called "law" of the gradual aging of the open-hearth furnace. Now, the efficiency of the open-hearth furnace remains the same during continuous production. In addition, after strengthening the steelmaking process, the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom area can also be increased by increasing the steel output of each furnace.

### 苏联各地钢铁厂推广氧气鼓风方法  每年可增产一千多万吨钢铁

    苏联各地钢铁厂推广氧气鼓风方法
    每年可增产一千多万吨钢铁
    据新华社讯　苏联各地钢铁工厂的高炉和平炉车间都在广泛采用氧气鼓风，强化金属冶炼过程，增加钢铁生产量。单在今年改用氧气鼓风的高炉和平炉就将有好几十座。乌拉尔、西伯利亚、顿巴斯和第聂伯河流域许多钢铁厂都在兴建新的氧气站。
    采用氧气鼓风在增产钢铁方面具有极为重大的意义。预计苏联全国现有高炉和平炉采用氧气鼓风后就可以在最近期间使钢铁的年产量增加一千多万吨。苏联许多巨大的钢铁企业，如萨坡罗什炼钢厂、电钢工厂、莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂等，由于运用了这种方法，在最近一年半到两年中已经使高炉和平炉的生产率提高了百分之十五到二十。
    苏联欧洲部分最大的“萨坡罗什炼钢厂”这方面的经验特别丰富。这个工厂的第十号平炉，单在使用氧气鼓风的第一年，就比没有使用氧气时多生产了三万二千吨钢，每炉的冶炼时间缩短了两小时。这个平炉在两次大修之间的炼钢达到五百六十八炉，比其他平炉的平均炼钢量多一百四十四炉。最近，工厂的平炉工人把送进平炉的热风中氧气的比重提高到百分之三十，把平炉的热力负荷增加到每小时三千二百万千卡后，一炉钢的冶炼时间已进而缩短到六小时。一昼夜可以炼四炉钢。
    这个工厂的实践推翻了所谓使用氧气一定会使平炉的寿命大大降低的论点。在使用氧气以前，工厂的铬镁砖炉顶平均炼不到四百一十七炉钢就损坏了。但是在一九五三年使用氧气时，平炉顶平均炼了四百二十七炉才要修理。铬镁砖炉顶和氧气战胜了所谓平炉逐渐衰老的“法则”。现在，平炉在连续生产时期中效能始终是一样的。此外，炼钢过程强化后，还可以增加每一炉的出钢量来提高每一平方公尺炉底面积的产钢量。
