Xinhua News Agency, Lausanne, July 11th: The First World Mothers' Congress concluded in Lausanne on the evening of the 10th.

    On the morning of the 10th, the Congress heard speeches from representatives of Cyprus, Brazil, Indonesia, Chile, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The Indonesian representative said that the Bandung Conference was a glorious and splendid page in the history of the Asian and African peoples. The principles established by the Asian-African Conference could serve as a guarantee for establishing peaceful relations between countries. The Chilean representative said that the heads of government of the four countries participating in the upcoming Geneva conference should listen to the calls for peace coming from Helsinki and Lausanne.

    The Congress began passing documents drafted by various committees in the evening. The Congress first passed a letter to the heads of government of the four major powers. The reading of the full text of this letter was met with a storm of applause. Then, the Congress unanimously adopted an appeal to the United Nations. Finally, the Congress enthusiastically and unanimously adopted the Declaration of the World Mothers' Congress. All the delegates stood up and applauded and cheered.

    Mrs. Gordon delivered a closing speech, pointing out that the World Mothers' Congress was conducted in a very sincere atmosphere. She thanked the Swiss women's organizations and local authorities for their warm hospitality to the delegates. She said that the First World Mothers' Congress was a remarkable proof of the effectiveness of international conferences. The ideas of the Congress united people of different religions, different skin colors, and different opinions from various countries. According to the decision of the Presidium of the Congress and the heads of all delegations, a Standing Committee of Mothers for the Defense of Children will be established. Therefore, the work of the First World Mothers' Congress will continue. Anne Andrée, a well-known activist in the international women's movement, was elected as the chairman of the committee.

    Mrs. Gordon finally announced the closure of the First World Mothers' Congress.

    The First World Mothers' Congress demonstrated the will of mothers around the world to defend the lives of children and to defend world peace. Among the delegates to the Congress, 653 women (more than half of all delegates) had never participated in an international conference before. This is a remarkable proof of the growing development and expansion of the peace movement.

    The professional composition of the delegations from the 66 participating countries proved the breadth of the Congress. The delegations included several female ministers, 32 parliamentarians, 97 educators, 55 doctors, 49 writers, poets and journalists, more than 100 female workers, peasants and staff members, 372 housewives, 23 cultural, scientific and artistic workers, 11 university students, and women from other professions.

    第一次世界母亲大会闭幕
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社洛桑十一日讯：第一次世界母亲大会于十日晚间在洛桑闭幕。
    大会在十日上午听取了塞浦路斯、巴西、印度尼西亚、智利、瑞士、荷兰等国代表的发言。印度尼西亚代表说，万隆会议是亚非各国人民的历史的辉煌灿烂的一页。亚非会议所制定的各项原则可以成为建立各国间和平关系的保证。智利代表说，参加即将举行的日内瓦会议的四国政府首脑应该倾听由赫尔辛基和洛桑发出的和平呼声。
    大会在傍晚时开始通过各委员会拟订的文件。大会首先通过了给四大国政府首脑会议的信。在宣读这封信的全文时引起了暴风雨般的掌声。接着，大会一致通过了致联合国呼吁书。最后，大会又热烈地一致通过了世界母亲大会宣言。全体代表起立鼓掌欢呼。
    戈登夫人致闭幕词，她指出，世界母亲大会是在非常诚挚的气氛中进行的。她感谢瑞士妇女团体和地方当局对代表们的热烈招待。她说，第一次世界母亲大会是国际会议富有成效的显著证明。大会的思想把各国具有不同宗教信仰、不同肤色和各种见解的人们团结起来了。根据大会主席团和所有代表团团长的决定，成立母亲保卫儿童常设委员会。因此，第一次世界母亲大会的工作将继续下去。国际妇女运动著名的活动家安·安德琳被选为委员会主席。
    戈登夫人最后宣布第一次世界母亲大会闭幕。
    第一次世界母亲大会显示了世界母亲保卫儿童生命和保卫世界和平的意志。大会代表中有六百五十三名妇女（超过大会全体代表半数以上）过去从来没有参加过国际会议。这是和平运动日益开展和扩大的显著证明。
    参加大会的六十六个国家代表团的职业成份，证明了大会的广泛性。代表团中有好几个女部长，有三十二个议员，九十七个教育家，五十五个医生，四十九个作家、诗人和记者，一百多个女工、农妇和职员，三百七十二个家庭主妇，二十三个文化、科学和艺术工作者，十一个大学生，以及其他职业的妇女。
