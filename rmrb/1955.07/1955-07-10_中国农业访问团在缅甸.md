The People's Republic of China Agricultural Delegation in Burma
Liu Ruilong, Head of the People's Republic of China Agricultural Delegation

At the invitation of the Government of the Union of Burma, the People's Republic of China Agricultural Delegation departed from Beijing on February 27, 1955, and arrived in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, on March 8. Thanks to the hospitality of our hosts, we were able to visit major agricultural areas in both Upper and Lower Burma in just three weeks. We visited thirteen cities and towns and surrounding rural areas, including Rangoon, Mandalay, and Moulmein, and toured a total of twenty-eight units, including agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and irrigation, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, freshwater fish farming, processing factories, and cooperatives. The vast and flat rice fields of the Irrawaddy River Delta, the animal husbandry and orchards on the Shan Plateau, the floating islands covered with flowers, fruits, and vegetables on Inle Lake, the coffee plantations, botanical gardens, and sericulture schools in Maymyo, a summer resort more than 1,000 meters above sea level, and the cotton fields, tobacco, and peanuts in the dry areas of the Irrawaddy River's middle reaches all left us with a deep impression.

The warm welcome and hospitality of the Burmese government and people were unforgettable. President Ba U received us during his busy schedule. When the delegation stayed in Rangoon twice, Prime Minister U Nu was visiting abroad, but he always expressed his concern for us. Wherever the delegation went, it was warmly welcomed and cordially received by local governments, representatives from all walks of life, officials from agricultural and forestry departments, farmer representatives, and overseas Chinese compatriots. An atmosphere of Sino-Burmese friendship was everywhere. Whether in speeches or in frequent friendly exchanges, there was a feeling of mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the two countries. The chairman of the Stable Freedom League said: "The close friendship between China and Burma is a symbol of consolidated peace." The deep traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma in history has been augmented by new factors due to mutual support and sympathy in the modern struggle against imperialist aggression and colonial rule. During the visit, we personally felt that since the prime ministers of China and Burma issued the statement on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the sympathy and friendship between the two countries has been growing day by day.

We visited several rural areas and farmer cooperatives and met with Burmese farmer brothers, who welcomed and received us in a simple, sincere, but enthusiastic manner. When we traveled from Meiktila to visit the Malain cotton field, we passed through Sweetwater Village. More than two hundred local farmers greeted us with gongs and drums, lined the streets to welcome us, and took us to a temporary colored shed set up on the roadside to treat us with tea and refreshments, and performed folk songs and dances, singing of Sino-Burmese friendship and thanking the delegation for coming.

Burmese farmers are hardworking and intelligent, the land is fertile and vast, and there are abundant agricultural resources. Most of Burma is located in the tropics, and a small part is in the subtropics, with a warm climate, no winter, and abundant rainfall, mostly above 1,000 mm, allowing crops to grow year-round. The total cultivated land area once reached 21 million acres, with an average of about 1.6 acres (about 10 mu) of cultivated land per agricultural population.

Burma has many types of crops, with temperate, subtropical, and tropical crops all growing. Lower Burma is dominated by rice. In addition to rice, Upper Burma also grows sesame, peanuts, corn, millet, various beans, tobacco, jute, and chili peppers; among them, the black soil area southwest of Mandalay is the center of cotton production. Sugarcane is abundant in central Burma and near Myitkyina. Forests account for more than half of Burma's land area, and forest resources such as precious teak and valuable hardwoods are extremely abundant. Yellow cattle and water buffalo are the main power for agricultural production; trained elephants are mostly used for transportation in teak forest areas. Burma has many rivers and lakes, including the famous Irrawaddy River and Salween River, and a coastline of up to two thousand miles, with a wide variety of aquatic products.

Rice and teak are Burma's two major agricultural export products. Rice, in particular, is the lifeline of the national economy. Before the war, the rice planting area reached 12 million acres, the rice yield was 7.5 million tons, and the export of rice was about 3.2 to 3.5 million tons, making it the world's largest rice-exporting country. At present, the rice planting area is about 10 million acres, with a rice yield of about 5.5 million tons.

Burma is a country with a long agricultural history, and farmers have accumulated a lot of experience in long-term production practice. The dry zone of Upper Burma is the earliest developed agricultural area in Burma. This is where Burma has relatively little rainfall, with some places only receiving 500 to 600 mm of rainfall throughout the year. Also like other parts of Burma, rainfall is concentrated in the rainy season from May to November each year, with very little rain for the remaining half of the year. The uneven distribution of rainfall has created certain difficulties for agricultural production. Burmese farmers have demonstrated a high degree of wisdom in their struggle with nature. They have built water conservancy projects, built dams and canals for irrigation, so in addition to rice, various other crops can also be grown, and in some areas, two crops a year are possible. Now many areas use the original irrigation system to expand the cultivated area. When we were in Meiktila, we visited artificial lakes and canals handed down from ancient Burma, which are still irrigating arid land and producing a variety of abundant crops.

The development of Lower Burma was relatively late, only about a hundred years ago. The rice area in 1865 was only 1.44 million acres, but by 1950 it had expanded to 6.7 million acres. All these were reclaimed piece by piece by the working farmers of Burma, relying on cattle and the simplest agricultural tools, shedding blood and sweat in the wilderness covered with bushes and forests.

In long-term production practice, Burmese farmers have also created and developed many crop varieties suitable for growing in various natural conditions. For example, in the lower reaches of the Xitang River in the Bago District of Lower Burma and scattered in the delta, there are many swamps. Every rainy season, the water depth reaches seven or eight feet or more. Local farmers plant a kind of deep-water rice, which is sown every year before the rainy season. After the rain comes, the rice seedlings can grow with the water. They can be submerged for a week without drowning when the water level rises sharply. They are harvested in November and can still get considerable yields. In the Meiktila Shijie area, we saw a kind of sugar palm tree, which is suitable for growing in dry areas. Each tree produces about 20 catties of sugar every year. The growth period can reach 60 years. The sugar can be used for food or wine, and it is the main income of farmers in the dry areas of Burma. On both sides of the river in southern Burma, many trees called "Attap" are planted. The leaves can be used to build houses, and the fruit can be eaten or used to make wine. This is a major source of income for local farmers.

Burma's agricultural products are very abundant. However, before independence, under the long-term colonial rule of British imperialism, a large amount of people's wealth was extracted, and the rural economy was in a state of stagnation and poverty for a long time. The Burmese people deeply hate the cruel rule of British imperialism for a hundred years. After World War II, American imperialism attempted to bind and enslave Burma with the guise of "American aid" and "technical cooperation," but was rejected by the Burmese people and did not fall into its trap. The United States' dumping of wheat and rice into the Asian market directly hit the sales of Burmese rice, which was even more hated by the Burmese people. The Burmese people cherish their country's independence very much, so it is only natural to demand the eradication of the scourge of colonialism. The Burmese people believe in their own labor and wisdom, and believe that only by getting rid of the shackles of imperialism can they live and build and create a happy life.

Burmese agricultural workers and scientists love their country. They work hard and have achieved a lot of success in improving the quality and yield of rice and cotton, increasing crop varieties and the number of harvests. Their spirit of making the best of circumstances, adapting to local conditions, and overcoming difficulties is worthy of our admiration. In the comprehensive livestock farm we visited in Taunggyi, they used mountain spring water, connected pipes to divert water, dug ponds to store water, solved the problem of drinking water for livestock, and planted pasture on the slopes along the contour lines to supply feed for the farm's livestock.

Workers engaged in farmland water conservancy are planning the development of irrigation in Upper Burma. The Dong Pulu sluice gate irrigation project we visited in Meiktila was completed in 1954. With the participation of the vast number of farmers, this project used rocks as a base and built an earth dam on it. The material cost was not much, and the irrigation area could reach 7,000 to 12,000 acres. This is indeed a good start for the further development of irrigation in Burma. In the management of irrigation in the dry areas of central Burma, they divided the irrigation channels of the rivers into irrigation areas, sub-areas, and small areas, and established institutions separately, with special personnel in charge, and channel managers and gate workers specializing in water distribution. The managers also regularly patrol and inspect, and these experiences are worth referring to.

Burma's forestry industry has a long history. In order to restore the forests in the dry areas of central Burma, scientists plan to afforest 1.2 million mu within eight years. Twelve species of drought-resistant and fast-growing local and foreign tree species have now been selected, especially the Mesquite tree introduced from South America (a leguminous evergreen shrub) can grow in areas with annual rainfall below 150 mm, and the leaves can be used as feed and green manure, and the wood is also good. In order to protect forest resources, especially the felling of teak, certain felling standards and a set of forest renewal methods have been stipulated. In terms of improving the utilization rate of wood, they are carrying out research on the comprehensive wood industry. We visited a furniture factory near Rangoon, where they used wood chips to try to make wall panels, which can save 20 to 30 percent of wood. They also treated bamboo with chemicals to make it durable and replace part of the wood used for building houses.

The Burmese people have a good impression of the industriousness, intensive farming, and rich experience of our farmers, and they are concerned about China's agricultural production. Many Burmese friends have also expressed great interest in China's water conservancy construction in recent years. At many symposiums held in the rural areas we visited, and even at the welcome meeting for representatives from all walks of life in Shijie, we were earnestly invited to introduce the agricultural production situation in New China. Burmese friends have a special affinity and interest in our country's special products such as tea and silk. In our delegation, there was Mr. Ding Ying, an old rice expert and president of the South China Agricultural College, and Comrade Wang Hanguo, a national model worker. They were warmly welcomed and respected everywhere. Many Burmese agricultural scientists and farmers were willing to exchange and study production technology opinions and questions with them.

During the visit, we had extensive contact with officials from the Burmese government's agricultural and forestry departments, agricultural scientists, and the vast number of farmers, held many symposiums, introduced and exchanged information and experience on agricultural production in the two countries, and exchanged views on strengthening ties in the future. In all these occasions, what we felt most deeply was the feeling of expectation for peace, friendship and cooperation; and this feeling was based on the universal recognition that agricultural construction can only be carried out with peaceful coexistence, and that agricultural production has a way out. When Burmese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Thakin Kyaw Dun presented gifts from the Government of the Union of Burma to our government at the farewell reception of the agricultural delegation, he said: "The mutual presentation of gifts by the governments of China and Burma is a manifestation of friendly sincerity. We must exchange agricultural production experience with each other. With the mutual exchange of experience and knowledge, the agriculture of the two countries will be further developed, and the five principles of peaceful coexistence of the joint statement of the prime ministers of the two countries will be better implemented, which will help the peace of Asia and the world." During the visit, we exchanged some excellent crop seeds with each other. These seeds will undoubtedly bloom peaceful flowers and bear happy fruits on the land of the two countries, and their seeds will be passed down from generation to generation.

We believe that agricultural exchanges and ties between the two countries will increase day by day, and we wish the farmers, agricultural workers, and scientists of the two countries to work together for the development of agriculture, the happiness of the people, and the cause of peace.

　　中国农业访问团在缅甸
　　中华人民共和国农业访问团团长　刘瑞龙
    中华人民共和国农业访问团应缅甸联邦政府的邀请，于一九五五年二月二十七日从北京出发，三月八日到达缅甸首都仰光。由于主人的盛意，使我们能在短短的三个星期内，访问了上下缅甸各主要农业区域，到了仰光、曼德勒、毛淡棉等十三处城镇和附近的农村，参观了农业、林业、水利灌溉、畜牧兽医、淡水养鱼、加工工厂、合作社等共达二十八个单位。伊洛瓦底江下游三角洲平坦辽阔的稻田，掸邦高原上的畜牧、果园，英利湖上长满了花果蔬菜的浮岛，在拔海一千多公尺高的避暑胜地—眉苗的咖啡园、植物园和蚕桑学校，以及伊洛瓦底江中游干燥地区的棉田、烟草和花生，都给我们很深刻的印象。
    缅甸政府和人民对我们的热情欢迎和招待，是令人难忘的。巴宇总统在百忙中接见了我们。当访问团两度逗留仰光期间，吴努总理正在国外进行访问，但对我们是始终表示关怀的。访问团所到的地方，受到当地地方政府、各界代表、农林部门的官员、农民代表以及我国旅缅侨胞的热烈欢迎和亲切接待，中缅友好的气氛到处在洋溢着，无论在讲话里，或频繁的友好交谈中，都充满着两国间互相了解、友好合作的感情。实阶自由同盟主席说：
  “中缅两国亲密友好是巩固和平的象征。”中缅两国人民历史上深远的传统友谊，在近代反对帝国主义的侵略战争和殖民主义统治的斗争中，由于互相支持、互相同情而增加了新的因素。在访问中，我们亲身体会到，自中缅两国总理发表和平共处五项原则的声明以来，两国的同情和友好正在日益增长。
    我们曾访问了好几个农村和农民合作社，同缅甸的农民兄弟们见了面，他们用简单、纯朴但又热烈的方式来欢迎和接待我们。当我们从密地拉赴马来因棉场参观时，途经甜水村，当地二百多农民敲锣打鼓，夹道相迎，把我们接到在路旁临时搭起的彩棚里以茶点款待，并表演民间歌舞，歌唱中缅友好，感谢访问团的来临。
    缅甸的农民是勤劳而智慧的，土地是肥沃而广阔的，有着丰饶富足的农业资源。缅甸极大部分地处热带，小部分在亚热带，气候温暖，没有冬季，雨量充沛，大部地区在一千公厘以上，农作物终年可以生长。已耕地总面积曾达二千一百万英亩，平均每
  一农业人口有耕地一点六英亩左右（约合十市亩）。
    缅甸的作物种类很多，温带、亚热带、热带作物都有生长。下缅甸以水稻为主。上缅甸除栽种水稻外，还有芝麻、花生、玉蜀黍、小米、各种豆类、烟草、黄麻、辣椒等；其中曼德勒西南黑土地带是棉花生产的中心。缅甸中部和密芝那附近盛产甘蔗。森林面积占全缅甸土地面积一半以上，林木资源如珍贵的柚木和有价值的硬木等蕴藏极丰。黄牛水牛是农业生产上的主要动力；驯象多在柚木林区用作运输。缅甸境内河流湖泊很多，有著名的伊洛瓦底江及萨尔温江，海岸线长达两千英里，水产种类名目繁多。
    大米、柚木是缅甸两大出口农产。尤以大米是国民经济的生命线。战前水稻种植面积曾达一千二百万英亩，稻谷产量七百五十万吨，出口大米约三百二十至三百五十万吨，是世界上输出大米最多的国家。目前水稻种植面积约为一千万英亩，产稻谷五百五十万吨左右。
    缅甸是一个有悠久农业历史的国家，农民在长期生产实践中积累了不少经验。上缅甸的干燥地带是缅甸开发最早的农业区域。这里是缅甸雨量比较少的地方，有的地方全年雨量只有五、六百公厘，而且也像缅甸其他地区一样，雨水集中在每年五月到十一月的雨季，其余半年则极少下雨。雨量分布不匀，给农业生产造成一定的困难。缅甸农民们在同大自然的斗争中，发挥了高度的智慧。他们在这里兴修水利、建筑堤坝水渠来进行灌溉，因此，这一带除能种植水稻外，还生长多种农作物，有的地区并能一年两熟。如今许多地区都利用了原有的灌溉系统，扩大了耕种面积。我们在密地拉时曾参观了缅甸古代传下来的人工湖和一些渠道，现在仍在灌溉着干旱的土地，生产出多种丰硕的庄稼。
    下缅甸的开发较迟，距今不过百余年历史，水稻面积在一八六五年还只有一百四十四万英亩，到一九五○年已扩大到六百七十万英亩。这些都是缅甸的劳动农民，在没有任何机器的条件下，依靠耕牛和最简单的农具，在长遍灌木丛林的荒原上，流血流汗，一块一块开垦出来的。
    缅甸农民在长期生产实践中也创造了和发展了不少适合于各地自然条件生长的作物品种。如在下缅甸勃固区西汤河下游及分散在三角洲的，有不少沼泽地，每到雨季，积水深达七、八呎以上，当地农民即种植一种深水稻，每年雨季前播种，雨来后，稻苗能随水生长，在水位猛涨时可淹没一星期不致淹死，十一月收割，仍能得到相当收获。我们在密地拉实阶一带看到一种糖棕榈，适于在干旱地区生长，每株每年产糖约二十斤，生长期可达六十年，糖可供食用或做酒，是缅甸干燥地区农民的主要收入。在缅甸南部河流两岸种植很多名叫“亚答”的树，树叶可盖屋，果可食亦可酿酒，这是当地农民一项很大的收入。
    缅甸的农产是很丰富的。但在独立前，在英帝国主义长期的殖民统治下，大量的人民财富被榨取，农村经济长期处于停滞和贫困的状态。缅甸人民对于英帝国主义百年来的残酷统治是深切痛恨的。第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义希图利用“美援”、“技术合作”等幌子束缚和奴役缅甸，被缅甸人民拒绝了，没有上它的圈套。美国向亚洲市场倾销小麦和大米直接打击了缅甸大米的销路，更为缅甸人所痛恨。缅甸人民是十分珍视自己祖国的独立的，因而要求根除殖民主义的祸害是很自然的。缅甸人民相信自己的劳动和智慧，相信只有摆脱帝国主义的枷锁才能够生活下去，才能进行建设和创造幸福的生活。
    缅甸的农业工作者和科学家们是热爱自己的祖国的，他们辛勤地工作，在提高大米和棉花的品质、产量、增加作物品种和收获次数等方面，获得不少成绩。他们因陋就简，因地制宜，克服困难的精神是值得我们钦佩的。我们在东技参观的综合种畜场，他们利用山顶泉源，接管引水，凿池蓄水，解决了牲畜的饮水问题，并在山坡上等高作垅，种植牧草，供应本场牲口饲料。
    从事于农田水利的工作者，正在就上缅甸的灌溉事业的开展进行规划。我们在密地拉参观的东普鲁水闸灌溉工程，是一九五四年才完成的。这项工程在广大农民的参加下，利用岩石为基，筑土坝于其上，材料所费不多，灌溉面积可达七千至一万二千英亩，对进一步开展缅甸灌溉事业说来，这确实是一个良好的开端。在缅甸中部干燥地区灌溉事业的管理上，他们按照河流的灌溉渠道划分成灌溉区、分区、小区分别设立机构，由专人负责，并有渠道管理员及闸工专司配水，管理员并经常巡视检查，这些经验是值得参考的。
    缅甸森林事业有悠久历史，科学工作者们为了恢复中部干燥地区的森林，计划在八年内造林一百
  二十万市亩，现已选出十二种耐干旱、生长迅速的本地及外来树种，其中尤以从南美引入的马斯奎树
  （一种豆科常绿灌木）能在年雨量一百五十公厘以下的地带生长，树叶并可充饲料及绿肥，木材亦好。为了保护森林资源，特别是柚木的采伐，规定了一定的采伐标准和一套森林更新的办法。在提高木材利用率方面，他们正在开展木材综合工业的研究。我们在仰光附近曾参观了一个家具厂，他们用碎木屑试制壁板，可节省木材达百分之二十到三十。又用药水处理竹子，使其经久耐用，以代替一部分建筑房屋用的木料。
    缅甸人民对于我国农民的勤劳、精耕细作和丰富经验有良好的印象，并对我国农业生产表示关怀。许多缅甸朋友对于中国近几年来的水利建设也表示了很大的兴趣。在我们所到的农村举行的许多座谈会上，以至在实阶的各界代表欢迎会上，我们都被恳切地邀请作关于新中国农业生产情况的介绍。对于我国的特产如茶叶、蚕丝等，缅甸朋友们更有亲切的好感和兴趣。在我们访问团中，有一位年老的水稻专家华南农学院丁颖院长和一位全国劳动模范汪汉国同志，他们到处都受到热烈的欢迎和尊敬，不少缅甸农业科学工作者和农民们都愿意同他们交换和研究生产技术方面的意见和问题。
    在访问中，我们曾和缅甸政府农林部门的官员、农业科学工作者及广大农民，进行了广泛的接触，举行了很多次座谈，介绍和交流了两国农业生产的情况和经验，交换了今后加强联系的意见。在所有这些场合里，我们感觉到最深刻的是期望和平、友好和合作的感情；而这感情是基于普遍认识到，只有和平共处，才能进行农业建设，农业生产才有出路的信念上的。缅甸农林部部长德钦觉顿在农业访问团告别招待会上代表缅甸联邦政府赠送给我国政府礼物时说：“中缅两国政府的互相赠送礼物是友好真诚的表现。我们要互相交换农业生产经验，随着经验知识的互相交流，将更进一步发展两国的农业，将会更好地执行两国总理联合声明的五项和平共处的原则，有助于亚洲及世界的和平。”在访问中，我们互相致送了一些优良作物种子，这些种子无疑地将在两国的土地上开出和平的花朵，结成幸福的果实，它们的种子又会一代一代地留传下去。
    我们相信两国在农业上的交往和联系将日益增进，并祝两国的农民和农业工作者和科学家们为了农业的发展，人民的幸福、和平的事业而共同携手前进。
