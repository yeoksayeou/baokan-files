    A Great Plan to Conquer Nature
    At the plenary session of the Second Meeting of the First National People's Congress on July 18, Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Hazards and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy." This report, for the first time in our history, comprehensively presented a great plan to completely eliminate the disasters of the Yellow River and to utilize the Yellow River on a large scale to develop irrigation, power generation, and shipping, for the benefit of the country and the people. This plan embodies the aspirations of the Chinese people for thousands of years and brings great encouragement to the people of the whole country who are selflessly working for the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before." Our Five-Year Plan and the plan to harness and develop the Yellow River are both parts of this glorious and great undertaking.
    The Yellow River Basin is the birthplace of Chinese history and the cradle of culture, and for a long time, it was the political and economic center of our country. The provinces and regions through which the Yellow River flows, such as Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong, have vast arable land and rich mineral resources. According to the provisions of China's First Five-Year Plan, industry and agriculture are developing rapidly in the provinces and regions of the Yellow River Basin, and many new industrial cities and industrial bases are under construction. Radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the construction of these new industrial cities and industrial bases.
    However, the Yellow River is also the most difficult river to tame since ancient times. According to historical records, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have experienced floods and breaches more than 1,500 times in more than 3,000 years, with 26 major changes in course. Each flood, breach, and change of course of the Yellow River caused painful losses to the lives and property of the people, and often entire villages and even entire cities were largely or entirely submerged. Obviously, we must fundamentally eliminate the disasters of the Yellow River to ensure the successful implementation of the plan to develop the Yellow River Basin and to utilize the Yellow River's abundant water resources to serve the people.
    The Chinese people and the Yellow River have fought for thousands of years. Da Yu, a figure in Chinese historical legends, was revered by later generations for his success in controlling the river. On both banks of the Yellow River in Henan and Shandong, the people built 1,800 kilometers of dikes, which are still an important weapon for us to fight against the Yellow River's water hazards. However, the people of the past, limited by social, scientific, and technological conditions, never had and could not possibly have had a way to completely eliminate the Yellow River's water hazards and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy. Only today, in a country led by the Communist Party and the people's own government, when the main means of production are in the hands of society and the vast majority of the people have been liberated from heavy exploitation and oppression, coupled with the level of modern science and technology, does the cause of controlling and developing the Yellow River have a bright future. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, while carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project, reconnaissance work on important rivers such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River began. The great plan of the Yellow River comprehensive planning is the first achievement of several years of effort. This plan eloquently demonstrates the infinite power of mankind to control and utilize nature under new social and technological conditions. Engels wrote in "Anti-DÃ¼hring": "In proportion as mankind becomes master of its own social relations, it becomes at the same time master of nature's relations." This is precisely the important social significance of our management and development of the Yellow River.
    The comprehensive plan for radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy includes a long-term plan and a first-stage plan. The main content of the long-term plan is to build forty-six dams on the main stream of the Yellow River from Longyang Gorge in Guide, Qinghai, upstream, to Luokou in Jinan, Shandong; to build twenty-four reservoirs in the important tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Wuding River and the Qingjian River; and to carry out large-scale soil and water conservation projects in the upper and middle reaches. After the completion of this series of projects, we will be able to control the flow of the Yellow River, intercept and store a large amount of sediment, and develop irrigation, power generation, and shipping on this basis. In this way, the river water in the lower reaches of the Yellow River will gradually become clear, the riverbed will continue to deepen, the river course will become increasingly stable, and the disasters of Yellow River flooding, breaches, and changes in course will be gone forever. Since the flood is controlled, we can further utilize the water conservancy of the Yellow River to serve mankind. After the complete realization of the long-term plan, the irrigated area of the Yellow River will be expanded from the current 16 million mu to 116 million mu, and the agricultural products in the irrigated area can be increased by more than double, with an annual increase of about 13.7 billion jin of grain and 1.2 billion jin of cotton (more than half of the national cotton production in 1954). The power generation industry in the Yellow River Basin will also be greatly developed. The annual power generation of the Yellow River's main stream alone can reach 110 billion kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to ten times the national power generation in 1954. The huge power supply can ensure that industries, transportation, modernized agriculture, and the vast residents in the Yellow River Basin obtain cheap electricity supply, realize electrification in this area, and save the country 70 million tons of coal annually, which is more than the national raw coal production in 1952. Our North China and Northwest China regions have always lacked an east-west shipping system since ancient times, causing great inconvenience to the transportation industry in this region. After the thorough development of the Yellow River, the shipping industry of the Yellow River also has a bright future. At that time, 500-ton tugboats can go upstream from the seaport all the way to Lanzhou, greatly improving the transportation conditions in the Yellow River Basin. It can be seen that the plan to harness and develop the Yellow River is a plan with great economic significance.
    The Yellow River comprehensive plan shows the importance of water. Water is the most precious, cheapest, and inexhaustible "fuel" and "fertilizer." In the past, many people only felt that the water of the Yellow River was harmful, but did not know that the water of the Yellow River was beneficial; they only felt that the water of the Yellow River was too much, but did not know that the water of the Yellow River was too little. This view must be changed. Li Bai, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, said: "The water of the Yellow River comes from heaven, rushing to the sea never to return." This second sentence is no longer correct after the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan is realized. The water of the Yellow River can no longer freely flow to the sea, but must generate huge power for the people along the way, provide navigation for the people, and most of the water is not discharged into the sea but irrigates the farmland on both sides, with almost no waste. Our motherland has huge water conservancy resources, and we should use the same method to utilize all water conservancy resources and not let them be wasted.
    Radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and comprehensively developing the Yellow River's water conservancy will take decades and require a large amount of manpower and material resources. In order to first solve the Yellow River's flood control problem and other urgent problems, the Yellow River Planning Commission has formulated a first-stage plan to be implemented during the three Five-Year Plans, that is, from now to 1967. This plan includes the construction of the Sanmenxia Project (near Shanzhou, Henan) and the Liujiaxia Project (near Lanzhou, Gansu) that can prevent floods, generate electricity, and irrigate, the construction of more than a dozen small and medium-sized reservoirs for flood control and irrigation, and the implementation of large-scale soil and water conservation work. The implementation of the first-stage plan will lay a good foundation for fundamentally eliminating the Yellow River.
    The realization of the first-stage plan for harnessing the Yellow River is not only the task of the people in the Yellow River Basin, but also the task of the people of the whole country. The people of our country have given ardent concern and strong support to the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project; can they not give greater concern and stronger support to the project of harnessing and developing the Yellow River, which is of greater significance than these projects?
    In order to realize the first-stage plan of the Yellow River plan, the current priority task is to actively complete the design and construction preparation of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations, and use accurate and effective work to ensure that these projects start on time. All factories responsible for supplying these projects with equipment and materials must ensure the production of high-quality products and deliver them to the construction site in a timely manner. Other project items that need to be further determined should actively complete the surveying work. Farmers in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River should do a good job in soil and water conservation work in accordance with national plans and local conditions. This is an effective measure to improve local agricultural production and a serious step to fundamentally eliminate the Yellow River. We should start early and strive to complete it on time. Farmers and migrant workers in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River should continue to carry forward their glorious traditions, process and reinforce the Yellow River embankment, strengthen the existing flood detention area facilities, and build new spillway weirs, making every effort to ensure that the Yellow River does not breach or change its course before it is fundamentally eliminated. We must widely publicize the significance of harnessing and developing the Yellow River to the people of the whole country and the residents who need to be relocated in the reservoir area, so that the residents of the reservoir area understand the consistency of the overall interests of the people of the whole country and their own long-term interests, and prepare to gradually realize the government's proposed relocation and resettlement plan in the future in accordance with the needs of the project over a long period of time.
    Harnessing and developing the Yellow River is a comprehensive and great undertaking. The departments of water conservancy, forestry, agriculture, industry, transportation, and scientific research, and the Party and government organs at all levels in the Yellow River Basin, must closely cooperate and act in coordination, and march in an orderly manner towards the great goal of changing the natural appearance of the Yellow River Basin under the unified command of the central government.
    Completely eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and comprehensively developing the Yellow River's water conservancy are things that our ancestors often envisioned but did not achieve. This matter will be successfully completed by our generation within a few decades. For thousands of years, our ancestors have made tenacious and sustained struggles to control the Yellow River; within a few decades, we and our generation will completely win this struggle. People can imagine how important this struggle is and how glorious this task is! We must harness the Yellow River, the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and other major rivers and rivers. We have the firm will to overcome all difficulties. "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and let the rivers give way!" This is our slogan.
