    A Great Plan to Conquer Nature
    At the plenary session of the Second Meeting of the First National People's Congress on July 18, Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Hazards and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy." This report, for the first time in our history, comprehensively presented a great plan to completely eliminate the disasters of the Yellow River and to utilize the Yellow River on a large scale to develop irrigation, power generation, and shipping, for the benefit of the country and the people. This plan embodies the aspirations of the Chinese people for thousands of years and brings great encouragement to the people of the whole country who are selflessly working for the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before." Our Five-Year Plan and the plan to harness and develop the Yellow River are both parts of this glorious and great undertaking.
    The Yellow River Basin is the birthplace of Chinese history and the cradle of culture, and for a long time, it was the political and economic center of our country. The provinces and regions through which the Yellow River flows, such as Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong, have vast arable land and rich mineral resources. According to the provisions of China's First Five-Year Plan, industry and agriculture are developing rapidly in the provinces and regions of the Yellow River Basin, and many new industrial cities and industrial bases are under construction. Radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the construction of these new industrial cities and industrial bases.
    However, the Yellow River is also the most difficult river to tame since ancient times. According to historical records, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have experienced floods and breaches more than 1,500 times in more than 3,000 years, with 26 major changes in course. Each flood, breach, and change of course of the Yellow River caused painful losses to the lives and property of the people, and often entire villages and even entire cities were largely or entirely submerged. Obviously, we must fundamentally eliminate the disasters of the Yellow River to ensure the successful implementation of the plan to develop the Yellow River Basin and to utilize the Yellow River's abundant water resources to serve the people.
    The Chinese people and the Yellow River have fought for thousands of years. Da Yu, a figure in Chinese historical legends, was revered by later generations for his success in controlling the river. On both banks of the Yellow River in Henan and Shandong, the people built 1,800 kilometers of dikes, which are still an important weapon for us to fight against the Yellow River's water hazards. However, the people of the past, limited by social, scientific, and technological conditions, never had and could not possibly have had a way to completely eliminate the Yellow River's water hazards and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy. Only today, in a country led by the Communist Party and the people's own government, when the main means of production are in the hands of society and the vast majority of the people have been liberated from heavy exploitation and oppression, coupled with the level of modern science and technology, does the cause of controlling and developing the Yellow River have a bright future. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, while carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project, reconnaissance work on important rivers such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River began. The great plan of the Yellow River comprehensive planning is the first achievement of several years of effort. This plan eloquently demonstrates the infinite power of mankind to control and utilize nature under new social and technological conditions. Engels wrote in "Anti-Dühring": "In proportion as mankind becomes master of its own social relations, it becomes at the same time master of nature's relations." This is precisely the important social significance of our management and development of the Yellow River.
    The comprehensive plan for radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy includes a long-term plan and a first-stage plan. The main content of the long-term plan is to build forty-six dams on the main stream of the Yellow River from Longyang Gorge in Guide, Qinghai, upstream, to Luokou in Jinan, Shandong; to build twenty-four reservoirs in the important tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Wuding River and the Qingjian River; and to carry out large-scale soil and water conservation projects in the upper and middle reaches. After the completion of this series of projects, we will be able to control the flow of the Yellow River, intercept and store a large amount of sediment, and develop irrigation, power generation, and shipping on this basis. In this way, the river water in the lower reaches of the Yellow River will gradually become clear, the riverbed will continue to deepen, the river course will become increasingly stable, and the disasters of Yellow River flooding, breaches, and changes in course will be gone forever. Since the flood is controlled, we can further utilize the water conservancy of the Yellow River to serve mankind. After the complete realization of the long-term plan, the irrigated area of the Yellow River will be expanded from the current 16 million mu to 116 million mu, and the agricultural products in the irrigated area can be increased by more than double, with an annual increase of about 13.7 billion jin of grain and 1.2 billion jin of cotton (more than half of the national cotton production in 1954). The power generation industry in the Yellow River Basin will also be greatly developed. The annual power generation of the Yellow River's main stream alone can reach 110 billion kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to ten times the national power generation in 1954. The huge power supply can ensure that industries, transportation, modernized agriculture, and the vast residents in the Yellow River Basin obtain cheap electricity supply, realize electrification in this area, and save the country 70 million tons of coal annually, which is more than the national raw coal production in 1952. Our North China and Northwest China regions have always lacked an east-west shipping system since ancient times, causing great inconvenience to the transportation industry in this region. After the thorough development of the Yellow River, the shipping industry of the Yellow River also has a bright future. At that time, 500-ton tugboats can go upstream from the seaport all the way to Lanzhou, greatly improving the transportation conditions in the Yellow River Basin. It can be seen that the plan to harness and develop the Yellow River is a plan with great economic significance.
    The Yellow River comprehensive plan shows the importance of water. Water is the most precious, cheapest, and inexhaustible "fuel" and "fertilizer." In the past, many people only felt that the water of the Yellow River was harmful, but did not know that the water of the Yellow River was beneficial; they only felt that the water of the Yellow River was too much, but did not know that the water of the Yellow River was too little. This view must be changed. Li Bai, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, said: "The water of the Yellow River comes from heaven, rushing to the sea never to return." This second sentence is no longer correct after the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan is realized. The water of the Yellow River can no longer freely flow to the sea, but must generate huge power for the people along the way, provide navigation for the people, and most of the water is not discharged into the sea but irrigates the farmland on both sides, with almost no waste. Our motherland has huge water conservancy resources, and we should use the same method to utilize all water conservancy resources and not let them be wasted.
    Radically eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and comprehensively developing the Yellow River's water conservancy will take decades and require a large amount of manpower and material resources. In order to first solve the Yellow River's flood control problem and other urgent problems, the Yellow River Planning Commission has formulated a first-stage plan to be implemented during the three Five-Year Plans, that is, from now to 1967. This plan includes the construction of the Sanmenxia Project (near Shanzhou, Henan) and the Liujiaxia Project (near Lanzhou, Gansu) that can prevent floods, generate electricity, and irrigate, the construction of more than a dozen small and medium-sized reservoirs for flood control and irrigation, and the implementation of large-scale soil and water conservation work. The implementation of the first-stage plan will lay a good foundation for fundamentally eliminating the Yellow River.
    The realization of the first-stage plan for harnessing the Yellow River is not only the task of the people in the Yellow River Basin, but also the task of the people of the whole country. The people of our country have given ardent concern and strong support to the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project; can they not give greater concern and stronger support to the project of harnessing and developing the Yellow River, which is of greater significance than these projects?
    In order to realize the first-stage plan of the Yellow River plan, the current priority task is to actively complete the design and construction preparation of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations, and use accurate and effective work to ensure that these projects start on time. All factories responsible for supplying these projects with equipment and materials must ensure the production of high-quality products and deliver them to the construction site in a timely manner. Other project items that need to be further determined should actively complete the surveying work. Farmers in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River should do a good job in soil and water conservation work in accordance with national plans and local conditions. This is an effective measure to improve local agricultural production and a serious step to fundamentally eliminate the Yellow River. We should start early and strive to complete it on time. Farmers and migrant workers in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River should continue to carry forward their glorious traditions, process and reinforce the Yellow River embankment, strengthen the existing flood detention area facilities, and build new spillway weirs, making every effort to ensure that the Yellow River does not breach or change its course before it is fundamentally eliminated. We must widely publicize the significance of harnessing and developing the Yellow River to the people of the whole country and the residents who need to be relocated in the reservoir area, so that the residents of the reservoir area understand the consistency of the overall interests of the people of the whole country and their own long-term interests, and prepare to gradually realize the government's proposed relocation and resettlement plan in the future in accordance with the needs of the project over a long period of time.
    Harnessing and developing the Yellow River is a comprehensive and great undertaking. The departments of water conservancy, forestry, agriculture, industry, transportation, and scientific research, and the Party and government organs at all levels in the Yellow River Basin, must closely cooperate and act in coordination, and march in an orderly manner towards the great goal of changing the natural appearance of the Yellow River Basin under the unified command of the central government.
    Completely eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and comprehensively developing the Yellow River's water conservancy are things that our ancestors often envisioned but did not achieve. This matter will be successfully completed by our generation within a few decades. For thousands of years, our ancestors have made tenacious and sustained struggles to control the Yellow River; within a few decades, we and our generation will completely win this struggle. People can imagine how important this struggle is and how glorious this task is! We must harness the Yellow River, the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and other major rivers and rivers. We have the firm will to overcome all difficulties. "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and let the rivers give way!" This is our slogan.

    一个战胜自然的伟大计划
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议七月十八日的全体会议上，国务院副总理邓子恢同志作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。这个报告在我国历史上第一次全面地提出了彻底消除黄河灾害，大规模地利用黄河发展灌溉、发电和航运事业的富国利民的伟大计划。这个计划集中地体现了千百年来我国人民的愿望，也给今天正为祖国社会主义建设事业而忘我劳动的全国人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    毛泽东同志说过：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”我们的五年计划和根治和开发黄河的计划，就都是这光荣伟大事业的一个部分。
    黄河流域是我国历史的发源地和文化的摇篮，在一个长时期内是我国政治和经济的中心。黄河流经的青海、甘肃、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、山东等省区，有广大的耕地和丰富的矿藏。根据我国第一个五年计划的规定，黄河流域各省区的工农业正在迅速发展，许多新的工业城市和工业基地正在建设中。根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利，对于这些新工业城市和工业基地的建设无疑地有巨大的作用。
    但是，黄河也是自古以来最难驯服的一条河流。据历史的记载，黄河下游在三千多年中发生泛滥、决口一千五百多次，重要的改道二十六次。黄河的每次泛滥、决口和改道都造成人民生命财产的惨痛损失，常常有整个村镇甚至整个城市人口被大部或全部淹没的惨事。显然，我们必须根治黄河的灾害，才能保证开发黄河流域的计划的胜利实现，才能利用黄河丰富的水力资源为人民服务。
    我国人民和黄河曾经进行了几千年的斗争。我国历史传说中的大禹，就以治河有功而受到后人的崇拜。在河南、山东境内黄河两岸，人民群众就筑了一千八百公里的河堤至今还是我们同黄河水害作斗争的重要武器。但是，过去的人民限于社会的条件和科学、技术的条件，从来没有也根本不可能有彻底根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的办法。只有在今天，在共产党和人民自己的政府领导的国家，在主要生产手段已为社会掌握而广大人民已从重重剥削和压迫下获得了解放的时候，再加上现代的科学技术水平，治理和开发黄河的事业才有了光明的前途。中华人民共和国成立以后，在进行根治淮河和荆江分洪等规模巨大的水利工程的同时，就开始了黄河、长江等重要河流的勘察工作。黄河综合规划的伟大计划，就是几年来努力的第一个成就。这个计划雄辩地说明了在新的社会条件和技术条件下人类控制和利用自然的无穷力量。恩格斯在“反杜林论”中写道：“随着人类成为自己社会关系的主人翁，他们也就以同样程度成为自然界的真正的和自觉的主人翁。”我们治理和开发黄河的重要社会意义也正是这样。
    根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，包括远景计划和第一期计划。远景计划的主要内容是从青海贵德上游龙羊峡起，到山东济南泺口止，在黄河干流上修建四十六个水坝；在黄河的重要支流如无定河、清涧河等处修建二十四个水库，并在上中游进行大规模的水土保持工程。在这一系列的工程完成以后，我们就可以控制黄河的水流，拦蓄大量的泥沙，并在此基础上发展灌溉、发电和航运事业。这样，黄河下游的河水将逐渐澄清，河身将不断刷深，河道将日趋稳定，黄河泛滥、缺口和改道的灾害将一去不返了。既然控制了洪水，也就可以进一步利用黄河的水利为人类服务了。在远景计划全部实现以后，黄河的灌溉面积将由现在的一千六百多万亩扩大到一亿一千六百万亩，灌溉区的农产物可以增加一倍以上，每年约可增产粮食一百三十七亿斤，棉花十二亿斤（比一九五四年全国棉花产量的二分之一还多）。黄河流域的发电事业也将大大发展，仅仅黄河干流本身，每年发电量就可达一千一百亿度，相当于一九五四年我国全国发电量的十倍。巨大的电源可以保证黄河流域的工业、交通运输业、现代化农业以及广大居民获得廉价的电力供应，在这一地区内实现电气化，并且每年可给国家节约燃煤七千万吨，比一九五二年全国原煤的产量还多些。我国华北、西北地区，从古至今一直缺乏横贯东西的航运系统，给这个地区的交通运输事业造成极大的不方便。彻底开发黄河以后，黄河的航运事业也有了光明的前途，到那时候五百吨的拖船由海口溯河西上，一直可到兰州，使黄河流域的交通运输状况得到极大的改善。由此可见，根治和开发黄河的计划是一个有伟大的经济意义的计划。
    黄河综合规划表明了水的重要，水是最宝贵的、最廉价的和取之不竭的“燃料”和“肥料”。过去许多人只感觉黄河的水有害，而不知道黄河的水有利；只感觉黄河的水太多，而不知道黄河的水太少。这种观点是必须改变了。唐朝的诗人李白说：“黄河之水天上来，奔流到海不复回。”这第二句话在黄河综合利用规划实现以后不再是正确的了。黄河的水不能够再自由地奔流到海，而必须在一路为人民发出巨大的电力，给人民通航，并且绝大部分的水量不是下海而是灌溉到两岸的农田上去，几乎没有浪费。我们祖国有巨大的水利资源，我们应该用同样的方法来利用所有的水利资源，不让它们浪费。
    根治黄河水害和综合开发黄河水利，需要经过几十年的时间，需要投入大量的人力和物力。为了首先解决黄河的防洪问题和其他的迫切问题，黄河规划委员会已经拟定在三个五年计划期间，即从现在到一九六七年实施的第一期计划。这个计划包括修建能够防洪、发电、灌溉的三门峡工程（河南陕州附近）、刘家峡工程（甘肃兰州附近），修建十多座防洪、灌溉用的中小型水库，进行大规模的水土保持工作。第一期计划的实施，将为根治黄河打下良好的基础。
    实现治理黄河的第一期计划，不仅是黄河流域人民的任务，而且是全国人民的任务。我国人民对于治淮工程和荆江分洪工程，曾经给予热切的关心和有力的支援；对于比这些工程更有伟大意义的根治和开发黄河的工程，难道还能不寄予更大的关心和给以更有力的支援吗？
    为了实现黄河规划的第一期计划，当前的首要任务，就是要积极完成三门峡和刘家峡水电站的设计和施工的准备，用准确、有效的工作，保证这些工程按时开工。一切负责供应这些工程以器材、设备的工厂，要保证生产质地良好的产品，并且及时送到工地去。其他还待进一步确定的工程项目，应当积极完成勘测工作。黄河中上游的农民们应该按照国家计划和当地情况，作好水土保持工作。这是提高当地农业生产的有效措施，也是根治黄河的严重步骤，应该及早动手，努力争取按时完工。黄河中下游的农民和民工们要继续发扬光荣传统，加工加固黄河大堤，加强已有的滞洪区的设施，兴修新的溢洪堰，尽一切努力保证黄河在得到根治以前不决口，不改道。我们要向全国人民和水库区需要迁移的居民广泛地宣传根治和开发黄河的意义，使水库区的居民懂得全国人民的整体利益和自己的长远利益的一致性，准备在将来按照工程的需要，在一个长时期内陆续实现政府拟定的迁移、安置计划。
    治理和开发黄河是一件综合性的伟大事业，水利、林业、农业、工业、交通运输业和科学研究各部门，黄河流域各级党和政府机关，必须密切配合，协同动作，在中央的统一号令之下，步伐整齐地向改变黄河流域自然面貌的伟大目标进军。
    彻底消除黄河水害，综合开发黄河水利，这是我们的祖先经常设想但是没有作到的事情。这件事情就要由我们这一代的人在几十年内胜利完成。几千年来，我们的祖先为控制黄河作过顽强、持久的斗争；在几十年内，我们和我们这一代的人要完全赢得这个斗争。人们可以想到，这个斗争多么重大，这个任务多么光荣！我们一定要治好黄河、淮河、长江和其他大江大河。我们有战胜一切困难的坚决意志。“让高山低头，让河水让路！”这就是我们的口号。
