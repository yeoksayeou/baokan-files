    Soviet Research on Methods to Protect Organisms from Harmful Effects of Radiation
    Staff members of the Special Radiobiology Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Morphology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are striving to study the most reasonable methods to protect organisms from the harmful effects of radiation and have achieved successes.
    This laboratory uses great force to study ionizing radiation that can cause damage to the organism, and how to prevent and treat the adverse consequences caused by such radiation on animal organisms. Experiments have shown that organisms with lower oxygen content are less susceptible to radiation infection. It has now been determined that substances such as carbon monoxide, heroin, morphine, and adrenaline can reduce oxygen content in tissues. Therefore, using one of these substances as protection can reduce the organism's susceptibility to radiation infection. Living organisms have so-called radiation-sensitive organs and tissue systems (bone marrow, spleen, etc.), which are quickly destroyed once affected by radioactive light. Scientists' experiments have shown that intravenous injection of bone marrow latex fluid from the same type of organism can effectively accelerate the recovery of the hematopoietic system after high-energy light radiation damage. Scientists at the institute also studied the effect of ionizing radiation on different parts of the central nervous system, as well as the susceptibility of different parts of the organism to radiation infection.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
    Vietnam Begins the Fourth Phase of Land Reform
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam began the fourth phase of land reform in early July.
    The fourth phase of land reform will be carried out in 900 villages in nine provinces: Vinh Phuc, Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Phu Tho, Ha Nam, Son Tay, Ninh Binh, Thanh Hoa, and Ha Tinh. The characteristics of this phase of land reform are that it is wide-ranging, and the area in which it is conducted is twice as large as during the third phase of land reform.
    The thirteen work teams participating in this phase of land reform had already begun to study policies and research the conditions in the land reform areas. On the 14th, three work teams went to Bac Giang and Phu Tho provinces in the Viet Bac Interzone to start work. Recently, another part of the work teams will go to Son Tay and Ninh Binh provinces in the Third Interzone. By mid-August, the fourth phase of land reform work will be fully launched in 900 villages.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联研究使生物不受放射线有害影响的方法
    苏联科学院动物形态学研究所特种放射生物学实验室的工作人员正努力研究各种保护生物不受放射线有害影响的最合理的方法，并且获得了成就。
    这个实验室以很大的力量来研究能引起机体电离作用的辐射线，研究如何预防和治疗动物机体因受这种光线伤害而引起的恶果。实验表明，含氧量较低的生物受辐射的感染较弱。现已确定，一氧化碳、海洛因、吗啡和副肾素等物质可以减低组织中的含氧量。因此，利用这些物质中的一种作为保护，就可使机体受这种光的感染较少。生物有所谓感光性强的器官和组织（骨髓、脾脏等）系统，它们一受到放射性光的影响很快就会破坏。科学家的实验表明，往静脉里注射同种类生物的骨髓乳胶液可以有效地加速造血系统受高能量光辐射伤害后的复元。研究所的科学家们还研究了有电离作用的光对中枢神经系统各个不同部分的影响，以及生物的各个不同部分受辐射的感染性。
