    Zhuang Language's Basic Dialect and Standard Pronunciation Have Been Selected

    The Zhuang Language Work Team, organized by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has selected the basic dialect and standard pronunciation for the Zhuang language, essentially concluding the first phase of research in creating the Zhuang script.

    The first phase of research began in March of this year. From September 1954 to March of this year, the Zhuang Language Work Team investigated more than 40 counties in the Zhuang areas of Guangxi, interviewed many Zhuang people of different dialects and ages, and collected materials for researching and creating the Zhuang script. Luo Jiguang, deputy leader of the Zhuang Language Work Team, told reporters: Accurately selecting the basic dialect and standard pronunciation of the Zhuang language is a prerequisite for creating the Zhuang script. After this stage of research, and with reference to the suggestions of Soviet linguist S.N. Serdyuchenko, it was decided to select the northern dialect of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which accounts for two-thirds of the population, as the basic dialect, and the spoken language of Wuming County near Nanning City as the standard.

    The Zhuang Language Work Team is now writing a preliminary opinion on the basic dialect and standard pronunciation of the Zhuang language, which will be printed and distributed to relevant departments to solicit opinions from the general public and cadres. (Xinhua News Agency)

    僮语基础方言和标准音已选定
    中国科学院语言研究所和桂西僮族自治区所组织的僮文工作队，已选定了僮语的基础方言和标准音，基本上结束了创造僮文的第一阶段的研究工作。
    第一阶段的研究工作是从今年三月开始的。从一九五四年九月到今年三月，僮文工作队曾调查了广西僮族地区四十多个县，访问了许多不同方言、不同年龄的僮族人民，搜集了可供研究创造僮文的材料。僮文工作队副队长罗季光对记者说：准确地选择僮语的基础方言和标准音，是创造僮文的先决步骤。经过这一阶段的研究工作，最后参考了苏联语言学专家谢尔久琴柯的建议，选定以人口占三分之二的桂西僮族自治区北部方言为基础方言，以南宁市附近的武鸣县的口语为标准。
    僮文工作队现正写好了关于僮文的基础方言和标准音的初步意见，印出后就分发给各有关部门，向广大群众和干部征求意见。　（新华社）
