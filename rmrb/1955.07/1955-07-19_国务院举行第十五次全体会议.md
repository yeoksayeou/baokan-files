Xinhua News Agency, July 18th -- The State Council of the People's Republic of China held its fifteenth plenary session on the afternoon of the 18th.

    The meeting heard explanations from Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Water Resources, and Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of the Fuel Industry, and adopted the report on the comprehensive plan for controlling the Yellow River's water damage and developing the Yellow River's water resources. It was decided that Vice Premier Deng Zihui would deliver the report on behalf of the State Council at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress and requested the Congress to review and approve it.

    The meeting then passed a resolution: In order to meet the needs of national planned construction and facilitate national administrative work, it was decided to abolish Rehe Province and assign its subordinate cities, counties, and banners to Hebei Province, Liaoning Province, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, respectively; and to abolish Xikang Province and assign its subordinate cities, counties, and autonomous prefectures to Sichuan Province. These two decisions will be submitted to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for review and approval. At the same time, in view of the fact that the number of members of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee needs to be appropriately increased after Xikang Province is incorporated into Sichuan Province, the meeting decided to suggest to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress that Article 25, Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the "Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels of the People's Republic of China" be appropriately revised.

    The meeting also approved the "Regulations (Draft) on Overseas Chinese Applying for the Use of State-Owned Barren Mountains and Barren Land" and submitted it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval.

    Finally, the meeting approved various appointment and dismissal lists.

    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国国务院全体会议第十五次会议在十八日下午举行。
    会议听了水利部副部长李葆华和燃料工业部副部长刘澜波的说明，并通过了关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，决定由邓子恢副总理代表国务院在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上作报告，并请大会审查批准。
    会议接着通过一项决议：为了适应国家计划建设的需要和便利国家行政工作，决定撤销热河省，将其所辖市、县、旗分别划归河北省、辽宁省和内蒙古自治区；撤销西康省，将其所辖市、县、自治州划归四川省。这两项决定将提请第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议审查批准。同时，会议鉴于西康省划归四川省后，四川省人民委员会组成人员的名额有必要适当增加，为此，决定向第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议建议，将“中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法”第二十五条第二款第一项加以适当修改。
