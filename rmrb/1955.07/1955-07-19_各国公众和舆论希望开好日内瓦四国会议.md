Korean "Nodong Sinmun"

    The Korean "Nodong Sinmun" published an article on the 15th, commenting on the upcoming Four-Power Summit in Geneva.

    The article stated: World public opinion hopes that the Four-Power Summit will discuss the most pressing issues in current international political life and find solutions. These issues are: disarmament, prohibition of atomic weapons, establishment of a European collective security system, restoration of German unity, guaranteeing peace in Asia and the Far East (including the withdrawal of foreign troops from Taiwan, fulfillment of the Geneva Accords on Indochina, and the peaceful reunification of Korea), and the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, etc.

Vietnamese "Nhan Dan"

    The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on the 18th regarding the Geneva Four-Power Summit.

    The editorial stated that in order to effectively ease international tensions, the countries participating in the Geneva Conference must promote the resolution of the most pressing international issues, such as the issues of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the establishment of a European collective security system, and the restoration of German unity. The conference must also discuss some acute problems in Asia because Asian peace and world peace are closely related. The editorial believes that the Four-Power Conference should contribute to improving the situation in Indochina, especially in Vietnam.

    The editorial said that the people of all countries demand that the heads of government of the four countries take responsibility for the cause of defending lasting peace and sincerely seek to resolve international disputes. The Soviet government delegation has expressed this determination. The delegations of other countries should also make the same efforts.

Indonesian "People's Daily"

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 16th, wishing the upcoming Four-Power Summit a success.

    The editorial said that the Five-Power Conference held in Geneva last year to resolve the Indochina issue, the settlement of the Austrian issue, and the Asian-African Conference—all of these events prove that negotiations can become the main, or even the only, way to resolve international disputes. Mutual understanding achieved in negotiations will not only be able to ease international tensions, but also achieve and promote international cooperation as a major condition for maintaining peace.

Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali

    Damascus News: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali made a statement at a press conference on the 17th, welcoming the Four-Power Summit in Geneva.

The "Daily Express" Moscow correspondent, Markol, wrote: "This is a very conciliatory statement," and added: "They (referring to the Soviet leaders - TASS editor) are clearly making their best efforts to give the Geneva conference a good start."

    All newspapers in Paris published the statement made by the Soviet government delegation at the press conference before leaving for Geneva in prominent positions.

    各国公众和舆论希望开好日内瓦四国会议
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”十五日发表文章，评论即将举行的四国政府首脑会议。
    文章写道：世界舆论希望四国首脑会议讨论目前国际政治生活中最迫切的问题，并且找出解决的道路。这些问题就是：裁减军备、禁止原子武器、建立欧洲集体安全、恢复德国的统一、保障亚洲及远东的和平（包括从台湾撤出外国军队、履行关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定以及和平统一朝鲜问题）和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利等。
    越南“人民报”
    越南“人民报”十八日就日内瓦四国政府首脑会议发表社论。
    社论说，为了切实地缓和国际紧张局势，参加日内瓦会议的国家必须促进解决目前最迫切的国际问题，例如裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题，建立欧洲集体安全体系问题以及恢复德国统一的问题。会议也必须讨论亚洲一些尖锐的问题，因为亚洲和平和世界和平是有着密切的关系的。社论认为，四大国会议应为改善印度支那的情况、特别是越南的情况作出贡献。
    社论说，各国人民要求四国政府首脑会议担负起对保卫持久和平的事业的责任，诚心诚意地设法解决国际上的争执问题。苏联政府代表团已经表示了这样的决心。其他国家的代表团也应该作同样的努力。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”十六日发表社论，祝即将举行的四大国政府首脑会议成功。
    社论说，去年在日内瓦举行的解决印度支那问题的五大国会议，奥地利问题的解决以及亚非会议——这一切事情都证明了：谈判是能够成为解决国际争端的主要的、甚至是唯一的办法的。在谈判中取得的相互谅解不但将能够缓和国际紧张局势，而且还可以实现和促进作为维护和平的主要条件的国际合作。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利
    大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利十七日在一个记者招待会上发表谈话，表示欢迎在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议。
    阿萨利总理说，“我们以强烈的希望和兴趣注视着日内瓦最高级会议”。他说，我们祝福任何为维护世界和平而作的努力。阿萨利希望，四大国能够使核子力量用于和平目的。
  美英法报纸重视苏联代表团声明
    纽约所有的晨报十六日都在第一版刊载了苏联代表团的声明。“每日镜报”的社论说，苏联代表团的组成表明在日内瓦也许有达成某些协议的可能。
    英国报纸十分重视苏联政府代表团在动身赴日内瓦之前向报界发表的声明。“泰晤士报”以“布尔加宁元帅的和平号召”为题刊载了这项消息。“每日快报”驻莫斯科记者马科尔写道：“这是一篇十分和解的声明”，又说：“他们（指苏联领袖们——塔斯社编者）显然正在尽最大的努力来使日内瓦会议有一个良好的开端。”
    巴黎所有报纸都以显著地位刊载了苏联政府代表团在赴日内瓦前在记者招待会上发表的声明。这些报纸都强调指出这个声明的极其沉着的和平的语调。“世界报”写道，四国政府首脑在动身前往日内瓦之前都发表了声明，表示他们的乐观看法。布尔加宁的声明是最值得注意的。事实上，布尔加宁表示了这种愿望，就是应该用和平合作来代替冷战。在布尔加宁的声明中所表现的克制、乐观和明智，已经使西方国家首都感到非常满意。这家报纸最后说，日内瓦会议将在一种“令人鼓舞的气氛中”开幕。　（据新华社讯）
