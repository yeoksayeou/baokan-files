Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th (TASS): Communiqué on the Visit of the Soviet Government Delegation to the German Democratic Republic.

At the invitation of Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, visited the German Democratic Republic from July 24th to 27th on their way back to the country after attending the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference.

During their visit to the German Democratic Republic, they visited a number of industrial and agricultural enterprises, as well as cultural institutions, and learned about the life and labor achievements of the residents of the German Democratic Republic.

Bulganin and Khrushchev, on the one hand, and Grotewohl, on the other, exchanged views extensively. The talks were attended by H. Matern, First Deputy Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic; Deputy Prime Ministers O. Nuschke, H. Loch, P. Scholz, L. Bolz; members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: F. Ebert, F. Oelsner, K. Schirdewan; and the Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, G.M. Pushkin.

The Soviet government delegation briefed the government of the German Democratic Republic in detail on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. Special attention was paid to the German question and the issue of safeguarding European security. Both sides fully agreed that the Geneva Conference promoted the easing of international tensions; in order to safeguard peace and the security of all peoples, negotiations must continue in a spirit of understanding and cooperation to reach agreement on outstanding international issues.

Both sides reaffirmed their unwavering desire to restore Germany's unification on a peaceful and democratic basis. At the same time, both sides believe that in the current European situation, the only realistic way to unify Germany is through the joint efforts of the four powers and the German people to ease European tensions and build trust between countries. The best way to achieve this goal is to establish a European collective security system, first by having the two parts of Germany participate in this system on an equal footing, and then by having a unified Germany participate in this system. Such a solution to the German question is based on the actual situation, that is, there are now two German states: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with different economic and social structures.

Both sides believe that the German question should not be allowed to become an obstacle to resolving the issue of safeguarding European security. The German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should contribute to the cause of safeguarding European security, thereby promoting the solution of the German unification issue.

Both sides proceed from the premise that the solution of the German question is impossible without the participation of the German people themselves, and without the rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Prime Minister Grotewohl emphasized the will and determination of the German Democratic Republic to participate in the European security system, and pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic is determined to do its utmost to promote the rapprochement between the two parts of Germany and the restoration of German unification.

At the initiative of the government of the German Democratic Republic, an exchange of views was held on the issue of former German prisoners of war who are serving sentences for crimes committed against the Soviet people. It was decided to continue discussing this issue, taking into account the wishes of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

The talks showed that the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic share completely identical views on the issues of the international situation and on the further deepening and expansion of political, economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

The two governments agreed to take further measures to develop and strengthen the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the basis of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs.

    关于苏联政府代表团访问德意志民主共和国的公报
    新华社二十八日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：关于苏联政府代表团访问德意志民主共和国的公报。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫应德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥的邀请，在参加日内瓦四国政府首脑会议后返国途中，从七月二十四日到二十七日访问了德意志民主共和国。
    在访问德意志民主共和国期间，他们参观了一些工业和农业企业，以及一些文化机关，并且了解了德意志民主共和国居民的生活和劳动成就。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫为一方同格罗提渥为另一方广泛地交换了意见。参加会谈的有德意志民主共和国人民议院第一副主席赫·马特恩，副总理：奥·努舍克、汉·洛赫、保·舒尔茨、洛·博尔茨，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员：弗·艾柏特、弗·埃尔斯纳、卡·希德万，以及苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使格·马·普希金。
    苏联政府代表团把日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果详细地通知了德意志民主共和国政府。德国问题和保障欧洲安全的问题得到了特别的注意。双方完全一致地认为，日内瓦会议促进了国际紧张局势的缓和；为了保障和平和各国人民的安全，必须以谅解和合作的精神继续举行谈判，以就悬而未决的国际问题达成协议。
    双方重申使德国在和平和民主的基础上恢复统一这一坚定不移的愿望。双方同时认为，在当前欧洲的局势下，统一德国的唯一现实的道路是四国以及德国人民共同努力来缓和欧洲紧张局势，建立国与国之间的信任。达到这一目的的最好的方法是：建立欧洲集体安全体系，先由德国两个部分以平等的地位参加这一体系，然后由统一了的德国参加这一体系。德国问题的这样一种解决是根据现实的情况的，即现在存在着两个德国：德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国，它们的经济和社会结构各不相同。
    双方认为，不能让德国问题成为解决保障欧洲安全问题的障碍。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国应当对保障欧洲安全的事业作出贡献，从而促进德国统一问题的解决。
    双方的出发点是，如果没有德国人民自己参加，如果德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国没有接近起来，德国问题的解决是不可能的。格罗提渥总理着重指出德意志民主共和国参加欧洲安全体系的意志和决心，并且指出，德意志民主共和国政府决心全力促使德国两个部分的接近和恢复德国的统一。
    根据德意志民主共和国政府的倡议，已就因犯了反对苏联人民的罪行而在服刑的前德国的战俘问题交换了意见。决定在考虑到德意志民主共和国政府的愿望的情况下继续讨论这一问题。
    会谈表明了，无论在国际局势的问题上，或是在进一步加深和扩大苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的政治、经济和文化的合作的方面，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府具有完全一致的看法。
    两国政府议定采取进一步的措施，以便在平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上发展和加强苏联同德意志民主共和国之间的友好关系。
