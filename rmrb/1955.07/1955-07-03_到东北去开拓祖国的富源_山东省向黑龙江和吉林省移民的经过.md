　　Going to the Northeast to Develop the Motherland's Rich Resources
　　——The Migration of People from Shandong Province to Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces
　　Li Baichao
    The Northeast of our motherland has boundless and fertile wilderness. Shandong, on the other hand, is densely populated, with insufficient land and a surplus of labor. In order to develop arable land, increase grain production, and fundamentally overcome the production and living difficulties of the people of Shandong, the Central Government decided this spring to move a portion of farmers from the Yellow River flood diversion areas, riverbed areas, waterlogged areas, and barren mountainous areas of Shandong to Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.
    Migration is a complex undertaking, and the party and government leaders of Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces attach great importance to it. Immigration committees have been established in both the emigration provinces and counties and the immigration recipient provinces and counties, and immigration agencies have also been established in the emigration area townships. Under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, immigration agencies at all levels have carried out a series of mobilization and organizational work.
    Prior to the migration, all migration counties in Shandong Province held migration meetings to arrange the migration work among cadres at all levels. Subsequently, some county and district staff went to the countryside to help rural staff carry out immigration organization and mobilization work. First, the masses were told about the benefits of migration to the country and themselves, explaining that all expenses along the way for this migration would be provided by the state; that upon arriving in the Northeast, they would join agricultural production cooperatives and produce together with the members; and that the relocating households must be of good class background, strong labor force, and willing to relocate the entire family. During the mobilization, staff members and farmers who had been to the Northeast gave explanations to address the concerns, misunderstandings, and superstitions of the masses. For example, some people mistakenly believed that the soil and water in the Northeast were not good, and were afraid of the cold weather and many wild animals; some elderly people were superstitious that "the soul cannot cross the Shanhaiguan after death." After repeated explanations, the misunderstandings, concerns, and superstitions were eliminated, and the broad masses of farmers expressed warm support for the government's migration measures, vying to sign up and request relocation. In many areas, the number of applicants greatly exceeded the estimated number. Moreover, all migrants achieved "three comprehensions," that is, "the individual comprehends, the whole family comprehends, and relatives and neighbors comprehend." Wang Guangcun, a middle peasant from Qianxingzhuang, Toudaolou Township, District One, Liangshan County, lived next to the Jinshan Dam and had always disagreed with the government's plan to turn this area into a Yellow River flood storage area, opposing the demolition of the Jinshan Dam to reinforce the southern bank of the Yunhe River. However, after listening to the report on migration and understanding the relationship between national interests and personal interests, he realized that his past thinking was wrong. He said to others: "Now, let alone demolishing the Jinshan Dam, even if you dig the soil from my roof to reinforce the southern bank, I have no objection!" Not only did his family decide to move to the Northeast, but he also actively persuaded relatives and neighbors to migrate. Under his influence, 47 percent of the farmers in Toudaolou Township requested to migrate.
    The immigration agency conducted a careful review of the applicants based on the immigration conditions, and provided persuasion and education to those who could not migrate, advising them to settle down and engage in production. After the list of migrants was determined, the immigration agency helped the migrants dispose of their property. The original land, housing and other property rights of the migrants were fully protected, and entrusted to groups, cooperatives, relatives and friends, or the government for safekeeping, as they saw fit; farm tools, furniture, etc., that could be taken were taken away, and those that could not be taken were purchased by the government or disposed of by themselves.
    Organizing the transportation of migrants was a difficult and meticulous task in the migration work. The Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and several directors often personally went to the station to arrange and inspect the work. The Director and directors of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Director of the Jilin Provincial Department of Civil Affairs led the heads or staff of the civil affairs sections of each immigration recipient county to Shandong to meet the migrants. Many transfer stations were set up along the way to provide tea and medical conditions. Vehicles and food were prepared in advance. Before getting on the train, the migrants were formed into teams and groups according to their own wishes and the distance of the settlement area. Each brigade was escorted by responsible staff from the county and district and township staff, and equipped with two or three medical personnel. Before departure, the staff and medical personnel responsible for escorting repeatedly educated the migrants about the common sense of riding, safety, hygiene, and mutual assistance and love. During the journey, the staff responsible for escorting constantly took care of the migrants and encouraged them to work hard and engage in production after arriving in the Northeast. Medical personnel and train attendants patrolled around day and night, providing timely treatment when diseases were found; and helping to solve difficult problems. When they found that the migrants were not properly covered at night, they helped to cover them, and constantly reminded the migrants to pay attention to safety and hygiene. Because of the thoughtful care along the way, the migrants were very moved. They said: Chairman Mao loves us more than our parents; he is afraid that we will be hungry, so the food is issued in abundance; he is afraid that we will be thirsty, so water stations are set up along the way; he is afraid that we will get sick, so doctors are sent to follow us; he also gives pregnant women injections to prevent miscarriage; and also sends staff to send us off. Everyone expressed that they would work hard to produce and grow more grain in the Northeast. The migrant Wang Quanli said with emotion: "In the old society, there was no way to make a living, so I ran to the Northeast to make a living. No one cared if you starved or thirsted to death. This time, the Communist Party and the People's Government have thought so carefully for us in migrating to the Northeast. I have lived for more than sixty years and this is the first time I have seen it."
    The proper resettlement of migrants is the final and most important task in the migration work. This work is related to the emotions of the migrants and their future production. The areas in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces that receive migrants have long been prepared to welcome and resettle them. Which household of migrants is settled in which area and joins which agricultural production cooperative has been studied and determined in advance. The housing, food, and supplies used by the migrants have been prepared by the agricultural production cooperatives. Banks and grain departments have also prepared loans and grain. When the migrants moving to Baoqing County, Heilongjiang, arrived at the train terminus, they were warmly welcomed by responsible comrades from the county and district who had come from afar. The members of the Kaoshan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in District Three of Baoqing County greeted the new neighbors with "five haves." The "five haves" are: "There is a mat on the kang, firewood in the yard, grain in the cloth bag, paper on the window, and pots and pans in the kitchen." The migrants were very satisfied with this warm reception and wrote letters to their relatives and friends in their hometowns, asking them to rest assured. When the migrants moving to Anguang County, Jilin Province, arrived at the train terminus, the station was crowded with people, old and young, men and women, driving carts and playing gongs and drums, to welcome their new friends and new neighbors. When the migrants entered the village, the members had already prepared tea, rice, and soup for them. After eating and drinking, the members sent each family to their new home - two rooms plastered with mud. The room contained millet, potatoes, and sauce, and the yard was piled with firewood. Then they sent pigs and chickens, and the pigsty and pig feed were already there. The old ladies were particularly concerned about the neighbors from afar, asking questions and talking with them until late at night.
    In the past, Shandong people went to the Northeast because they were "forced to go to Liangshan" or "break through the Guandong"; now they are going to the Northeast to develop the rich resources of the motherland. In the past, they left with the sad emotions of "wives and children separated" and "leaving their hometowns"; but now they are happy as a family, and the future is full of unlimited hope. In the near future, large areas of wilderness in the Northeast will become fertile fields, and the lush weeds will be replaced by oily green crops. The grain-deficient households of today will then be well-fed and well-clothed.

　　到东北去开拓祖国的富源
　　——山东省向黑龙江和吉林省移民的经过
　　李白超
    祖国的东北，有一望无际的肥沃荒原。山东各地，却人口密集，土地不够使用，劳动力过剩。为了开拓耕地，增加粮食，并从根本上克服山东人民生产和生活上的困难，中央决定今年春天从山东的沿黄河分洪区、河床区、内涝区和贫瘠山区，移一部分农民到黑龙江省和吉林省去。
    移民是一项复杂的工作，山东、黑龙江和吉林省的党政领导机关都非常重视。移民省县和移民迁入省县都成立了移民委员会，移民区乡也都建立了移民机构。在各级党委和政府的领导下，各级移民机构进行了一系列的动员和组织工作。
    在移民以前，山东省各移民县都召开移民会议，把移民工作在各级干部中作了布置。接着一部分县区工作人员下乡帮助乡村工作人员开展移民的组织动员工作。先向群众讲明移民对国家和自己的好处，说明这次移民沿途的费用全由国家供给；到东北加入农业生产合作社，和社员们一起生产；说明迁移户必须是成份好、劳动力强而又愿意全家迁出的。在动员中间，工作人员和曾到过东北的农民，针对群众的顾虑、误解和迷信分别作了解释。如有些人误认为东北水土不好，害怕东北天气太冷，野兽多；有的老人则迷信“死后灵魂不能过山海关”。经过反复解释，消除了误解、顾虑和迷信以后，广大农民对政府的移民措施都表示热烈拥护，争先恐后报名，要求迁移。许多地区的报名人数都大大超过了预计数。而且所有移民都作到了“三通”，即“本人通，全家通，亲邻通”。梁山县一区头道楼乡前邢庄中农王广存，家住在金山坝旁，一向不同意政府把这一带辟为黄河蓄洪区，反对扒金山坝垫运河南堤。但当他听了关于移民的报告，懂得了国家利益和个人利益的关系以后，知道自己过去的想法是错了。他对别人说：“这会别说扒金山坝，就是挖我房上的土垫南堤，我也没意见啦！”他不但自家决定迁往东北，而且积极劝说亲友邻居迁移。在他的影响下，头道楼乡有百分之四十七的农民要求迁移。
    移民机构根据移民条件对报名户进行了认真审查，对不能迁移的户都进行了说服教育，劝他们安心生产。移民名单确定后，移民机构就帮助移民处理家产。移民原有的土地、房屋等产权，一律予以保护，交组、交社、交亲友或交政府代管，各由自便；农具、家具等能带的带走，不能带的由政府收购或本人自行处理。
    组织移民的运送，是移民工作中一项艰巨细致的工作。山东省民政厅副厅长和几位处长常常亲自到车站布置和检查工作。黑龙江省民政厅的厅长、处长和吉林省民政厅的处长都带领各移民迁入县的民政科长或工作人员到山东迎接移民。沿途设了很多转运站，供应茶水和提供医疗条件。车辆和食物，都事先准备妥当。上火车以前，移民们都根据自愿和安置地区的远近编成队和组。每大队都有县的负责工作人员和区、乡工作人员护送，并配备医务人员二、三名。出发以前，负责护送的工作人员和医务人员反复地向移民进行了关于乘车常识、安全、卫生和互助友爱的教育。旅途中，负责护送的工作人员不断来回照料移民，鼓励移民到东北以后要好好劳动生产。医务人员和列车员不分昼夜地到处巡视，发现疾病就及时治疗；有困难问题就帮助解决。夜里发现移民有没盖好被子的，他们就帮助盖好，并且时时提醒移民要注意安全和卫生。因为沿途照顾周到，移民都很感动。他们说：毛主席比爹娘还爱护咱；怕咱饿了，食物发得足足的；怕咱渴了，沿途设上水站；怕咱病了，派医生跟着；怕孕妇流产，给打上预防针；还派工作人员送咱们去。大家表示到东北一定努力生产，多打粮食。移民王全礼感慨地说：“在旧社会里，生活没办法，跑到东北去谋生，你饿死渴死根本没人管。这次往东北移民，共产党和人民政府为咱们想得多周到，我活了六十多岁还是第一次见到。”
    对移民的妥善安置，是移民工作中最后的也是最重要的一项工作。这项工作关系移民的情绪和今后的生产。黑龙江省和吉林省有移民迁入的地区，早都作好了欢迎和安置的准备。哪户移民安置到哪个地区，加入哪个农业生产合作社，都事先研究确定了。移民住的、吃的、用的，农业生产合作社都准备好了。银行和粮食部门也预备了贷款和粮食。迁入黑龙江宝清县的移民，到达火车终点站的时候，受到从远道赶来的县区负责同志的热烈欢迎。宝清县三区靠山村农业生产合作社的社员们是以“五有”来接待新邻居的。“五有”是：“炕上有席，院里有柴，布袋里有粮，窗上有纸，厨房有锅碗瓢勺”。移民对这种热情的接待很满意，都写信给家乡的亲友，请他们放心。迁入吉林省安广县的移民到达火车终点站的时候，车站上围满了人，老的少的，男的女的，赶着马车，敲着锣鼓，来迎接他们的新朋友和新邻居。移民进了村，社员们已经准备好了茶、饭、汤在等着他们。吃喝以后，社员把每家都送进新居——泥得光光的两间房子里。房里放着小米、土豆、酱，院里堆着柴。接着又送来了猪、鸡，猪圈和猪食早都有了。老太太们对从远方来的邻居特别关怀，问这问那，同他们直谈到深夜。
    过去山东人去东北，是“逼上梁山”，“闯关东”；现在他们是为开发祖国的富源而到东北去。过去出走时都怀着“妻离子散”、“背乡离井”的忧伤情绪；而现在他们是全家欢乐，前途充满了无限希望。在不久的将来，东北大片大片的荒野将会变成肥田沃土，丛生的野草将为油绿的庄稼所代替。今天的缺粮户那时都会丰衣足食。
