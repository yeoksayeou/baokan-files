    Firmly Eliminate the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries
    Broad Masses of Readers Write to This Newspaper
    To Expose Hu Feng Clique Members and Other Counter-Revolutionaries
    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people, and has also sharpened their eyes and raised their revolutionary vigilance. The broad masses of the people are actively exposing Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members and other hidden counter-revolutionaries and bad elements.
    Since this newspaper published the first batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique on May 13, the editorial department has received more than 11,800 letters from readers by July 9, including 503 letters of accusation. These letters come from major and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, Kaifeng, Xiamen, Xuzhou, Hangzhou, and Lushun; and from rural areas in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Hebei, Anhui, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia. The people writing the letters of accusation include workers, peasants, soldiers, students, teachers, government employees, medical workers, commercial workers, residents, geological survey workers, and so on. This batch of letters includes important historical information exposing Hu Feng and his group's core members such as A Long, Lü Yuan, Lu Dian, Xie Tao, Lu Ling, Peng Baishan, Liu Xuewei, and Fang Ran; revelations of their various destructive activities before and after liberation; and also revelations of the criminal activities of other hidden counter-revolutionaries.
    According to the information provided by the masses in their letters of accusation, many members of Hu Feng and his group have had close ties with the Kuomintang's "Central Statistics Bureau," "Military Statistics Bureau," "Blue Shirts Society" and other secret service agencies, as well as American and Japanese secret service agencies and terrorist groups, for a long time. Some were reactionary military officers whose profession was to massacre the people, some were landlords and local bullies with blood debts, some were heads of the false "Joint Security" system and drill instructors of the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Army"; some were shameful traitors who betrayed the revolution and sold out the revolution, and some were deserters from the revolutionary ranks. The letters of accusation also revealed that after liberation, Hu Feng and his group members opened "strongholds" in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Qingdao and other places, infiltrating into government offices, troops, enterprises, schools, and organizations, stirring up trouble, spreading rumors and slanders, undermining the prestige and policies of the Party, "winning over people," "contacting people," poisoning young people, and splitting the unity of the revolutionary ranks.
    The letters of accusation also exposed other counter-revolutionaries lurking on the mainland of our country. Among them, some were executioners who had committed many evil deeds, had heavy blood debts, and had massacred the people, and some were secret agents of Japan and the US-Chiang Kai-shek regime. Some of them had already infiltrated into the revolutionary ranks, and some were still lurking in various places. After liberation, they still refused to repent, spread rumors and cause trouble everywhere, incited the masses, and carried out various destructive activities.
    According to the appraisal of the public security organs, most of these mass letters of accusation are valuable, and some of them provide very important clues, helping the government to find out the criminal situation of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and other hidden counter-revolutionaries, and playing an active role in eliminating the Hu Feng group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries.
    These letters of accusation show that the political consciousness of many readers has been greatly improved, and they have shown their enthusiasm in the struggle against hidden counter-revolutionaries. This enthusiasm of the broad masses is very valuable, because, to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, we must rely on the correct guidance of the leading organs and the high awareness of the broad masses, and the foundation of our strength is the political vigilance of the people and their ability to distinguish between counter-revolutionaries.

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    广大读者纷纷写信给本报
    检举胡风集团分子和其他反革命分子
    胡风反革命集团的被揭发，激起了广大人民群众的愤怒，同时也擦亮了人们的眼睛，提高了人们的革命警惕性。广大人民群众纷纷检举胡风反革命集团分子及其他暗藏的反革命分子和坏人。
    本报自五月十三日公布了胡风反革命集团的第一批材料后，到七月九日，编辑部已收到读者来信一万一千八百多封，其中检举信共五百零三件。这些信件有来自北京、上海、天津、南京、武汉、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、广州、西安、兰州、昆明、重庆、开封、厦门、徐州、杭州、旅顺等大中城市的；有来自四川、江西、湖北、湖南、浙江、河北、安徽、辽宁和内蒙古等地农村的。写检举信的人有工人、农民、战士、学生、教师、机关工作人员、医务工作人员、商业工作者、居民、地质普查工作者等等。这批信件中，有检举胡风及其集团的骨干分子阿垅、绿原、芦甸、谢韬、路翎、彭柏山、刘雪苇、方然等的重要历史情况的；有揭发他们在解放前后进行种种破坏活动的；还有揭发其他暗藏的反革命分子的罪恶活动的。
    根据群众在检举信中提供的情况，胡风及其集团中的分子，有不少人，很早以来就同蒋介石国民党的“中统”“军统”“蓝衣社”等特务机关以及美国和日本的特务机关、恐怖集团有密切联系；有些人是以屠杀人民为职业的反动军官，有些人是有血债的地主恶霸分子，有的人是伪联保主任、“反共义勇队”的督练员；有些人是叛变革命、出卖革命的可耻叛徒，有的是革命队伍里的逃兵。检举信还揭发了胡风及其集团分子，解放后，在北京、上海、天津、武汉、南京、杭州、青岛等地，开辟“据点”，钻到机关、部队、企业单位、学校、团体，兴风作浪，造谣污蔑、破坏党的威信和政策，“争取人”、“联络人”，毒害青年，分裂革命队伍的团结。
    检举信还揭发了其他潜伏在我国大陆上的反革命分子，他们之中，有的是过去罪恶多端，血债累累，残杀人民的刽子手，有的是日本、美蒋的特务分子，他们之中有的已经钻到革命队伍里来了，有的还继续潜伏在各地。他们在解放后仍死不悔改，到处造谣生事，煽惑群众，进行种种破坏活动。
    这些群众的检举信，据公安机关的鉴定，认为绝大部分都是有价值的，其中一部分并提供了十分重要的线索，帮助了政府查清胡风反革命集团及其他暗藏的反革命分子的罪恶情况，对肃清胡风集团及一切暗藏的反革命分子的工作，起了积极的作用。
    这些检举信，表示了许多读者政治觉悟的大大提高，在反对暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中表现了自己的积极性。这种广大群众的积极性是十分可贵的，因为，要肃清暗藏的反革命分子，必须依靠领导机关的正确指导和广大群众的高度觉悟相结合才能办到，而我们的力量的基础是人民群众的政治警惕性和他们对于反革命分子的辨别能力。
