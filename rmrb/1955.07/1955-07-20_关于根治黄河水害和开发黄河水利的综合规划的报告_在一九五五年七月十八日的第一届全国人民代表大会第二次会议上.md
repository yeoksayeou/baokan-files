Comrades and Deputies,

I now represent the State Council to report on the comprehensive plan for controlling Yellow River floods and developing Yellow River water resources. Since this plan involves more than five years, with the first phase of the project not completing until 1967, it needs to be discussed as a separate issue outside the First Five-Year Plan.

The Yellow River is a matter of great concern to the entire nation. It is China's second-largest river, originating from the Yogong Zonglie Canal in Qinghai and flowing through Qinghai, Gansu (including the former Ningxia Province), Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong, entering the sea east of Lijin in Shandong. The total length of the Yellow River is 4,845 kilometers. The drainage area of the Yellow River, calculated from a natural geographical perspective (based on whether surface water flows into the Yellow River to define the boundary of the drainage area), is 745,000 square kilometers. For the convenience of economic statistics, we still follow the past practice and consider the entire territories of Qinghai, Gansu, the part of the former Suiyuan Province in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces, as well as the entire territory of Hebei Province, which is closely related to the Yellow River, as part of the Yellow River drainage area. The Yellow River basin is the birthplace of Chinese history and the cradle of Chinese culture. For a long period, it was the political and economic center of the country. According to statistics from 1954, the Yellow River basin has 656 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 40% of the national cultivated land area; among these, the wheat planting area accounts for 61.7% of the national total, the planting area of various coarse grains accounts for 37% to 63% of the national total, the cotton planting area accounts for 57% of the national total, and the tobacco planting area accounts for 67% of the national total. The Yellow River basin is rich in underground resources such as coal, petroleum, iron, copper, aluminum, and other large deposits. In the provinces and autonomous regions of the Yellow River basin, industry is developing rapidly, and many new industrial cities and industrial bases are being built.

The Yellow River basin has another very important resource, which is the Yellow River water system itself. According to water resource observations over the past few decades, the average annual water volume of the Yellow River is approximately 47 billion cubic meters, although this is only about one-twentieth of the average annual water volume of the Yangtze River. However, if fully utilized, it can expand the irrigation area to 116 million mu of land, and within this irrigation area, it can increase grain production by 13.7 billion jin and cotton production by 1.2 billion jin. After the water volume of the Yellow River is properly regulated, the river can be navigable from Guide in Qinghai to the sea. The hydropower of the Yellow River is particularly valuable. The river source is 4,368 meters above sea level, and just the hydropower from Guide in Qinghai downwards can generate 23 million kilowatts, producing 11 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This has great significance for the industrial development of the Yellow River basin and the overall industrialization and electrification of the country. Due to its favorable terrain, the construction cost of most hydropower stations on the Yellow River is relatively low; as for the cost of electricity generation, it can be reduced to about one-tenth of the current cost of thermal power generation in China.

However, the current state of the Yellow River cannot make such a great contribution. Although the Yellow River basin is developing into a vast industrial area, hydropower generation on the Yellow River has not yet begun. The irrigation areas along the Yellow River currently total only 165 million mu, and in most places, the equipment is outdated and cannot guarantee irrigation needs. There is no modern navigation on the Yellow River, and only individual isolated river sections allow the passage of wooden boats and rafts with a capacity of 10 to 75 tons. Moreover, the Yellow River often poses a significant threat to the Yellow River basin and the entire country.

The Yellow River is a famous river known for its disasters, both in ancient and modern times, both domestically and internationally. Its main disaster is flooding. The Yellow River basin has very little rainfall, with an average annual precipitation of only 400 millimeters, about one-third of the average annual rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and one-fourth of the average annual rainfall in the southeastern coastal regions. However, about half of the annual rainfall in the Yellow River basin is concentrated in the summer months of July and August, and during this period, a place can sometimes receive 700 to 800 millimeters of rain in a month; moreover, summer rains are often torrential, and a place can sometimes receive 150 millimeters of rain in a day. Such concentrated summer torrential rains often cause floods to surge, known as the "flood season." The Yellow River has many tributaries in Shaanxi, and if the area affected by summer torrential rains is large, several tributaries can flood simultaneously, causing extremely large floods. For example, the average annual flow rate of the Yellow River at Shanzhou in Henan is only 1,300 cubic meters per second, but during the largest flood in the summer of 1933, the flow rate reached 22,000 cubic meters per second, and during the largest flood in 1843 (the 23rd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty), the flow rate is estimated to have reached around 36,000 cubic meters per second, both causing extremely severe floods. Most of the floods in the Yellow River are caused by such summer torrential rains. In addition, large rains can sometimes cause floods in September and October, known as the "autumn flood season." In March and April, melting ice and snow can also cause floods, known as the "peach flood season." The Yellow River flows from south to north in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Shandong. During the thawing season in the south, the north is often still frozen, and a large amount of ice can block the river in the lower reaches, causing the river to surge, known as the "ice flood season."

The floods in the Yellow River are particularly severe not only because of the summer torrential rains in the Yellow River basin but more importantly because of the silt deposition in the lower reaches of the Yellow River (referring to the section from the Qinhe mouth to the sea; the section from Guide in Qinghai to the Qinhe mouth is called the middle reaches; the section above Guide is called the upper reaches). The Yellow River is called the Yellow River because it is a silt-laden river; the saying "jump into the Yellow River and you can't wash clean" reflects this characteristic. The Yellow River has the highest silt content among the rivers of the world. The average annual silt content per cubic meter is 1 kilogram in the Nile River in Egypt, 4 kilograms in the Amu Darya River in the Soviet Union, and 10 kilograms in the Colorado River in the United States, while in Shanzhou in Henan, it reaches 34 kilograms. According to water resource calculations, the Yellow River carries an average of 13.8 billion tons of silt per year from Shanzhou to the lower reaches and the sea, with a volume of approximately 9.2 billion cubic meters; if this amount of silt is used to build a levee 1 meter high and 1 meter wide, it would be enough to encircle the Earth's equator 23 times! Since the Yellow River carries so much silt, in the lower reaches, due to the gentle riverbed, the silt cannot completely flow into the sea and is deposited in large quantities, causing the riverbed to gradually rise and become shallower, eventually rising above the levees on both sides, forming a "river above ground." The silt-laden river flows on the silt bed, making it difficult to stabilize the river channel. The large amount of silt deposited at the sea mouth also gradually extends, not only making the seaward waterway itself changeable but also exacerbating the overall crisis in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Therefore, when encountering larger floods that the levees cannot contain, the lower reaches of the Yellow River will experience severe disasters such as flooding, breaches, and changes in course.

Due to the above situation, although there are also floods in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the most severe floods are concentrated in the lower reaches. According to historical records, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have experienced 1,500 or more floods, breaches, and changes in course over more than 3,000 years, with 26 major changes in course, of which 9 were significant. The northernmost change in course was through the Haihe River to the Dagu mouth, and the southernmost change in course was through the Huaihe River to the Yangtze River. Therefore, the disasters of the Yellow River have long affected the Haihe River basin, the Huaihe River basin, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, threatening the safety of more than 80 million people in an area of 250,000 square kilometers. Each flood, breach, and change in course of the Yellow River has caused tremendous losses of life and property, often resulting in entire villages or even entire cities being partially or completely submerged. In 1933, the flood caused more than 50 breaches, affecting an area of 11,000 square kilometers, with more than 3.64 million people affected, 18,000 people dead, and property losses estimated at 230 million silver dollars at the time. In 1938, the Kuomintang government in China breached the levee on the south bank near Zhengzhou in Henan, causing a major change in the course of the Yellow River, affecting an area of 54,000 square kilometers, with 12.5 million people affected and 890,000 people dead. This shows the severity of the Yellow River disasters.

The disasters of the Yellow River are inseparable from the crimes of the reactionary ruling class. The fate of the lower reaches of the Yellow River has undergone significant changes in the era of people's democracy. The Communist Party of China and the people's government have led the masses to wage a tenacious struggle against the disasters of the Yellow River. Since the restoration of the levee at Huayuankou in 1946, the people's governments on both banks of the Yellow River in the liberated areas have actively led the people to prevent the disasters of the Yellow River. Over the past nine years, the people's government has repaired and reinforced 1,800 kilometers of the Yellow River (including the north and south levees, the north and south Jin levees, and the Qinhe levee), completing 130 million cubic meters of earthwork; replaced the original straw levee slopes with stone materials, using 23 million cubic meters of stone; and discovered and filled 80,000 cavities and cracks on the levees using the cone exploration method. This fundamentally changed the original state of the levees being dilapidated, low, and full of holes—this state was a symbol of the corruption and incompetence of the reactionary ruling class and their disregard for human life. The Communist Party and the people's government have actively led the local people to engage in levee protection and flood prevention work during the flood season in the lower reaches of the Yellow River every year, and the People's Liberation Army has also actively participated in this struggle. Many brave and hardworking heroes and models have emerged in the struggle to protect the levees and prevent floods. In September 1949, when the flood situation in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was severe, 400,000 residents and troops in the lower reaches, under the leadership of the Party and the government, took turns guarding the Yellow River levee for about a month day and night, finally successfully overcoming the danger. In addition, due to the narrow river channel in Shandong, which could not discharge a large amount of floodwater, the people's government established a flood detention area on both sides of Dongping Lake in Shandong that can temporarily divert about 3,000 cubic meters per second of floodwater from the Yellow River; and established a large flood detention area between the Yellow River levee and the Jin levee north of the levee from Changyuan in Henan to Shouzhang in Shandong, which can temporarily divert 5,000 cubic meters per second of floodwater, and built a flood control weir at the entrance in Shitouzhuang, Changyuan. To reduce the threat of ice floods, in addition to organizing the breaking of ice, explosions, artillery bombardment, and aerial bombardment of ice blocks during the ice flood season, a flood control weir was also built in Xiaojiezizi, Lijin, Shandong. Relying on all these efforts, we have reversed the precarious situation of the Yellow River breaking its levees almost every year over the past century, ensuring the safety of the lower reaches of the Yellow River over the past nine years.

The following comparison can illustrate the changes in the Yellow River before and after liberation: During the Kuomintang period, the maximum flow rate of the 1934 flood (based on the flow rate near Qinchang in Zhengzhou, the same below) was only 8,500 cubic meters per second, but the Yellow River still breached in four places in Changyuan, Henan, affecting six counties. The maximum flow rate of the 1935 flood reached 13,300 cubic meters per second, and the Yellow River again breached in a major way in Xincai, Shandong, affecting more than 20 counties in Shandong and Jiangsu, with more than 2 million people affected. However, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the maximum flow rate of the 1954 flood reached 14,000 cubic meters per second, but the Yellow River remained unharmed.

However, can we say that the disasters of the Yellow River have been eliminated? Absolutely not. On the contrary, we must see that the disasters of the Yellow River have been increasingly severe in history. From 1048 (the middle of the Northern Song Dynasty, the 8th year of the Qingli reign of Emperor Renzong) to 1855 (the 5th year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty), a period of 807 years, there were three major changes in the course of the Yellow River; from 1855 to the present, there have been 200 breaches. The main reason for this is the increasing silt deposition in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. According to recent actual measurements, the riverbed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River rises by 1 to 10 centimeters per year; in some places, the riverbed is now 10 meters higher than the ground. The silt deposited at the sea mouth advances in a fan shape 40 kilometers wide, and from 1949 to 1951, it advanced 10 kilometers in three years. The silt deposition is so rapid that it is obviously not possible to solve the problem by simply raising and reinforcing the levees; moreover, in a sense, the higher and stronger the levees are, the faster the silt deposition in the river channel, as it cannot be discharged to both sides of the levees. Therefore, under this vicious cycle, the dangers of flooding, breaching, and changing the course of the river still exist. Our current flood control weirs are relatively simple and can only cope with sudden surges and drops in floodwater, and they were built with the 1933 flood as the target, without yet discovering the fact that the 1843 flood was half as large as the 1933 flood. The 1843 flood, according to records at the time, surged 2.08 meters in 44 hours, rising from Luoyang in Henan to overflow the levees in Zhongmou, flowing through eastern Henan and northern Anhui into Hongze Lake, causing extremely severe disasters along the way. This flood is still remembered in the folk songs of the Shanzhou area with a terrifying hue, with the lyrics: "In the 23rd year of Daoguang, the Yellow River surged to the sky, sweeping away Taiyangdu and carrying away Wanjin Bay." We must solve the problem of silt deposition in the Yellow River, thoroughly control the disasters of the Yellow River, and make the Yellow River never flood, breach, or change its course, to ensure the safety of countless Taiyangdu and Wanjin Bay, and to ensure the safety of millions of people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Haihe, Huaihe, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

In the Yellow River basin, in addition to the severe floods, there are also severe soil erosion in the middle reaches and severe droughts throughout the basin.

In the eastern part of Gansui, most of Shaanxi, most of Shanxi, and part of western Henan, a large amount of soil is lost every year. Most of the soil loss is due to rainwater, especially torrential rain, erosion, and a small part is due to wind erosion. According to observations by the Soil Conservation Experimental Station in Suide, Shaanxi, a 15-minute rainfall of 16 millimeters in Suide's Linjia Xian caused an average erosion of 2.6 millimeters of soil in the observation area; a 6-minute rainfall of 16 millimeters in Wanma Gorge in the same county caused an average erosion of 3.8 millimeters of soil in the observation area. In the severely eroded areas of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, about 10,000 tons of soil are lost per square kilometer per year, and the ground level drops by an average of 1 centimeter per year. In the entire middle reaches of the Yellow River, about 3,700 tons of soil are eroded per square kilometer per year, which is 26 times the world average of 134 tons of soil erosion per square kilometer per year. According to analysis, these eroded soils contain 0.8 to 1.5 kilograms of nitrogen, 1.5 kilograms of phosphorus, and 20 kilograms of potassium per ton. Due to such severe erosion, vast fertile plateaus in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi have gradually been eroded into many steep gullies 200 to 300 meters deep; then, as the gullies continue to increase and expand, the flat land gradually disappears, being cut into countless long ridges and round-topped hills, becoming a "hilly gully area"; and in some of the most severely eroded areas, the soil on some hills has already been largely lost, beginning to turn into barren rocky mountains. This process of change has been ongoing for many years in the above-mentioned areas, gradually reducing the arable land, decreasing soil fertility, lowering agricultural productivity, and making it difficult for the vast majority of farmers to significantly improve their living conditions.

Although the Yellow River basin suffers from disasters caused by torrential rains, the overall rainfall is still insufficient; in some places, due to very little rainfall, such as northern Gansu and southwestern Inner Mongolia, it has become a desert or semi-desert area. Insufficient rainfall makes the water volume of the Yellow River insufficient. Especially from November of each year to May or June of the following year, the river level is low, with the average monthly flow rate accounting for only 3% to 5% of the annual flow rate. The middle reaches have many gullies and steep slopes, the ground lacks forests and grasslands to absorb water, and there are few ponds and lakes to store water, so a lot of rainwater is lost on the ground, making the river water prone to sudden surges and drops, which is the so-called "easy to rise and fall mountain stream water." In addition, although irrigation using the Yellow River has been practiced for more than 2,000 years (the Qin Canal and Han Canal in the former Ningxia area of Gansu Province still exist), it is still not well developed. Due to these reasons, the Yellow River basin often suffers from droughts. During the 268 years of the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River basin experienced 201 droughts. From 1876 to 1879 (the 2nd to 5th years of the Guangxu reign), Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan experienced severe droughts, with more than 13 million people dying. In 1920, the above four provinces and Shaanxi had 317 counties experiencing severe droughts, with 20 million people affected and 500,000 people dying. In 1929, the Yellow River basin experienced another severe drought, with 34 million people affected.

Due to droughts, floods, and soil erosion, agricultural production in the Yellow River basin has been severely affected. Although these damages have been mitigated since liberation, due to the short period of time, the people's government has not yet been able to implement large-scale, systematic plans to transform the natural conditions of the Yellow River basin, and agricultural production in the Yellow River basin still faces some special difficulties. The Yellow River basin accounts for approximately 38% of the national grain planting area, but because the average grain yield per mu is only about 120 jin, and in areas with severe soil erosion, it is only a few dozen jin, the grain yield accounts for only about 28% of the national total. Eliminating various disasters of the Yellow River and increasing grain production in the Yellow River basin is an important measure that should be taken to solve China's grain problem.

So, what is our task regarding the Yellow River now?

Based on the various aspects of the resources and disasters of the Yellow River mentioned above, our task is not only to fundamentally control the disasters of the Yellow River but also to stop soil erosion in the Yellow River basin and eliminate droughts in the Yellow River basin; not only to eliminate water and drought disasters of the Yellow River but especially to fully utilize the water resources of the Yellow River for irrigation, power generation, and navigation, to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and transportation. In short, we must completely conquer the Yellow River, transform the natural conditions of the Yellow River basin, to fundamentally change the economic landscape of the Yellow River basin, to meet the requirements of the current socialist construction era and the future communist construction era for the resources of the Yellow River.

What principles and methods should we adopt to achieve this goal?

In Chinese history, the broad masses of the people have continuously waged a great struggle against the disasters of the Yellow River. The people in Henan and Shandong along the Yellow River alone have built 1,800 kilometers of levees, which are still our main weapons in the struggle against the disasters of the Yellow River today. As for the levees along the old courses of the Yellow River, there are countless more, and it is difficult to calculate. The millions of residents along the lower reaches of the Yellow River engage in intense flood prevention work every flood season, fight against floods when they occur, and strive to restore agricultural and other production after the disaster. It is precisely because of this that the lower reaches of the Yellow River, as early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, were one of the important regions in China with a dense population and developed economy. The legend of Yu the Great controlling the floods fully reflects the brave spirit of the ancient Chinese people in resisting floods. The legend says that Yu's father, Gun, failed to control the floods in nine years and was killed by Yu; Yu continued his father's work, married the next day and left, spending eight years outside and passing his door three times without entering. "If I do not control the floods, how can I save the people of the world?" (Guo Moruo: "The Flood Era") Yu's great ambition still inspires people's hearts today. Because the Yellow River frequently floods and breaches, successive governments have spent a lot of money to repair the levees and often appointed special officials to manage the river control work. Although many of these officials were corrupt and embezzled funds, there were also some who were serious about their work, dedicating their lives to the safety of the Yellow River. Among them, notable figures include Pan Jixun in the latter half of the 16th century (from the Jiajing to the Wanli reigns of the Ming Dynasty), Jin Fu and Chen Huo in the latter half of the 17th century (the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty), who all made significant contributions to the levee construction and flood prevention work in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

However, all those who controlled the Yellow River in the past were unable to fundamentally solve the problem of the Yellow River. This is because they were limited by the social conditions and scientific and technological conditions of their time, only trying to find ways to send the water and silt downstream in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The myth of Yu "digging the Dragon Gate" and "dredging the Nine Rivers" represents the ancient idea and practice of sending water and silt downstream. Pan Jixun's famous slogan of "building levees to control water and using water to attack silt" also did not go beyond this scope. Of course, under the conditions where the Yellow River could not be fundamentally controlled, "controlling water" in the lower reaches was better than allowing the water to flood, and "attacking silt" was better than allowing the silt to deposit. However, facts have proven that water and silt cannot be "sent" away, and the policy of sending water and silt downstream cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Today, under the conditions of science and technology, if our people's government still follows this policy to control the Yellow River, it would be completely wrong. Today, we must seek a thorough solution, a comprehensive solution to the Yellow River problem, not only to eliminate floods but also to develop water resources. Based on this requirement, the policy we should adopt for the Yellow River is not to send water and silt downstream but to control and utilize them.

Why? Because: first, the floods and silt in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the soil erosion in the middle reaches, as well as the droughts in the middle and lower reaches, are interrelated, and they are fundamentally the result of not being able to control water and silt; without solving the problem of controlling water and silt, the disaster problem of the Yellow River cannot be fundamentally solved. Second, as long as we can control the water and silt of the Yellow River, they will not only not cause disasters but will also bring us endless happiness.

Everyone knows that the lower reaches of the Yellow River, due to the elevated riverbed, have no tributaries except for the Wenshui River flowing from the Yimeng Mountains into Dongping Lake, so the floods of the Yellow River are basically from the middle reaches. But where does the silt in the lower reaches of the Yellow River come from? Chen Huo of the early Qing Dynasty explained: "The silt-laden water comes from the long journey, countless containers, and the sandy and loose soil areas in the northwest, where the water flows faster and the water is more turbid." Scientific observations have proven that this view is basically correct; the silt of the Yellow River basically also comes from the middle reaches, especially from the area where the Yellow River bends southward from the Yellow River Bend, flowing through the gorge area between Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The water in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is clear, and the average annual silt content per cubic meter in Lanzhou is only 3 kilograms, and in Baotou, it is still only 6 kilograms. But when it reaches the middle of Shaanxi at Longmen, due to the acceptance of many tributaries with extremely high silt content (such as the Wuding River with an average annual silt content of 145 kilograms per cubic meter), the average annual silt content per cubic meter increases to 28 kilograms. Below Longmen, the tributaries flowing into the Yellow River, such as the Fen River from Shanxi, the Luo River (hereafter referred to as the North Luo River to distinguish it from the Luo River in Henan), the Jing River, and the Wei River from Gansu and Shaanxi, all have high silt content (the Jing River has an average annual silt content of 161 kilograms per cubic meter), so when it reaches Shanzhou in Henan, the average annual silt content per cubic meter increases to 34 kilograms, and the maximum silt content reaches 580 kilograms. Below Shanzhou, although the tributaries flowing in from the south bank, such as the Yi River and the Luo River (hereafter referred to as the South Luo River to distinguish it from the Luo River in Shaanxi), still contain an average annual silt content of 6 kilograms per cubic meter, the silt content of the Yellow River does not increase but decreases due to gradual deposition. According to calculations, in Shanzhou, 90.9% of the massive silt in the Yellow River comes from above the river mouth of Huhekou, 49.1% comes from the section between Huhekou and Longmen, and 40% comes from the section between Longmen and Shanzhou. This means that almost all the silt of the Yellow River comes from the middle reaches, and almost 90% comes from the tributaries in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi.

Why does the middle reaches of the Yellow River have such a large amount of silt flowing into the Yellow River? Originally, from the Liupan Mountains in the west to the Yinshan Mountains in the north, from the Taihang Mountains in the east to the Qinling Mountains in the south, there is the world's largest loess area, which is basically the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Due to the loess being "sandy and loose," it is particularly easy to be eroded; due to the frequent torrential rains in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the erosion is particularly strong; due to the loess plateau being eroded into many steep slopes, the steep slopes are more easily eroded by torrential rains; and due to the deforestation and over-cultivation of the slopes, the soil lacks protection and is more quickly eroded: all these factors cause the middle reaches of the Yellow River to continuously and massively erode into the Yellow River every year, gradually turning the once vast and fertile plateau into a barren hilly area, making the riverbed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River continuously silted and changing, making the Yellow River the most silt-laden and difficult-to-control river in the world.

It can be seen that the "silt" in the lower reaches of the Yellow River is actually not sand but extremely valuable loess. It can be seen that the fundamental cause of the floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River is the soil erosion in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. And soil erosion is also an important cause of droughts in the Yellow River basin.

The erosion of loess into the Yellow River is a natural process that has been ongoing for tens of thousands of years. From a geological history perspective, today's North China Plain and even the Huaihe Plain are mainly the result of the Yellow River and its tributaries depositing silt. However, this natural process has caused a series of serious disasters for humans who have settled in the plains or plateaus. Today, we have recognized this law of nature and must change the process and results of their effects according to the laws of nature.

In his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Stalin once said: "In ancient times, the flooding of rivers, the overflowing of water, and the resulting destruction of houses and crops were considered inevitable disasters. However, with the development of human knowledge, when people learned to build dams and hydroelectric stations, they could prevent society from the floods that were previously considered unavoidable. Not only that, people have also learned to stop the destructive power of nature, so to speak, to tame it, turning water power into a blessing for society, using water for irrigation and obtaining power." What we are doing today is exactly this.

Since the floods and silt in the lower reaches of the Yellow River basically come from the middle reaches, and the middle reaches urgently need these water and silt, we should control the water and silt in the middle reaches. How can we control them?

To control water and silt in the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River and on the surface of the Yellow River basin, two methods are needed: first, to build a series of dams and reservoirs on the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River. Relying on these dams and reservoirs, we can intercept floods and silt, prevent floods; regulate water volume, develop irrigation and navigation; more importantly, we can build a series of hydroelectric stations of different scales, obtaining a large amount of cheap power. Second, in the areas with severe soil erosion in the Yellow River basin, mainly in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, we should carry out large-scale soil conservation work. This means protecting the loess from being eroded by rainwater, intercepting rainwater to prevent it from flowing into gullies and rivers, thus avoiding soil erosion in the middle reaches and eliminating the source of floods in the lower reaches.

From the plateau to the gully, from the tributary to the main stream, intercepting water at every step, intercepting silt in sections, using river water as much as possible for industry, agriculture, and transportation, and retaining loess and rainwater on farmland: this is the basic method to control the water and silt of the Yellow River, to control the floods of the Yellow River, and to develop the water resources of the Yellow River.

Of course, relying on handicraft technology, it is impossible to build reservoirs and hydroelectric stations on the Yellow River or its tributaries, and relying on the strength of individual farmers, it is impossible to carry out large-scale soil conservation work. Here, modern scientific and technological knowledge is needed, a large amount of national investment is needed, the support of the masses is needed, and the cooperation of the government and the people, workers, and farmers is needed. Therefore, it was impossible to adopt this method in the past.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the central people's government quickly began to study the Yellow River problem. To fundamentally control the floods of the Yellow River and develop the water resources of the Yellow River, the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China (mainly the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission it leads), the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Geology, and other relevant departments have carried out large-scale preparatory work in the past few years. Historical records and a large amount of data accumulated by Chinese water conservancy scholars and water conservancy workers over the past few decades have been systematically sorted out and utilized. A large number of personnel from various relevant departments have conducted extensive surveys, measurements, geological investigations, drilling, hydrological tests, and economic investigations in the entire Yellow River basin. They have surveyed 16,000 kilometers of the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River (including the source of the river), measured various topographic maps covering 85,000 square kilometers, selected 100 "comparative dam sites" on the main stream, drilled 344 boreholes at 27 dam sites, and conducted economic investigations of reservoirs covering 11,000 square kilometers.

In 1952, China invited a comprehensive team of Soviet experts to help solve the Yellow River planning task. The Soviet expert team, led by A. A. Kolosov and consisting of six other experts, has been working in China for the past few years.

Title: Comprehensive Utilization of the Yellow River

In January 1954, experts from the Soviet Union, Chinese experts, and relevant department heads formed the Yellow River Survey Team. They conducted a detailed survey from Liujiaxia upstream in Lanzhou to the Yellow River's estuary, returning to Beijing by the end of June. In April of the same year, the Water Resources Department and the Fuel Industry Department established the Yellow River Planning Commission to compile the Yellow River planning and design documents. With the full guidance and assistance of the Soviet expert team, the work was completed by October of the same year. The comprehensive utilization plan for the Yellow River proposed by the Yellow River Planning Commission was formulated in accordance with the principles and methods of controlling water disasters and developing water resources. The State Planning Commission reviewed and approved this plan, and the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also studied it. The State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that although this plan was still only an outline, its specific engineering projects and many locations and figures still needed further research and determination, the principles and basic contents were completely correct.

The comprehensive utilization plan for the Yellow River includes both a long-term plan and a first-phase plan. The main content of the long-term plan is the so-called "Yellow River Mainstream Staircase Development Plan," which involves building a series of dams on the Yellow River mainstream to transform the Yellow River into a "staircase river." This plan starts from the Longyangxia in Qinghai Province and ends at the Taohuayu in Henan Province. According to the characteristics of the river, the middle reaches of the Yellow River are divided into four sections for separate utilization. The first section is from Longyangxia to Qingtongxia in Gansu Province. This section of the river flows through mountainous areas with steep slopes and abundant water resources. New industrial areas are rapidly developing, so it is necessary to focus on hydropower generation. At the same time, the reservoir can be used for flood control and irrigation. The second section is from Qingtongxia to Hekou Town in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This section has fertile soil but lacks rainfall. The riverbed is wide and the slope is gentle, making it suitable for navigation. Therefore, the main tasks for this section are developing irrigation and navigation. The third section is from Hekou Town to Yumenkou in Shanxi Province. This section of the Yellow River enters the gorges of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, with steep slopes. However, due to geological and geographical conditions, large dams and reservoirs cannot be built, and hydropower can only be utilized after the construction of large upstream reservoirs. The fourth section is from Yumenkou to Taohuayu. This section from Yumenkou to Shaanxian is a loess plain, and the riverbed is wide. From Shaanxian to Mengjin, it is a gorge area, which is a key section for controlling floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. It is also close to the industrial areas of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. Therefore, the main tasks for this section are flood control and power generation. Below Mengjin, it is basically a plain with a gentle riverbed, where dams can be built to irrigate important agricultural areas nearby. According to the preliminary design, 44 dams suitable for different conditions and tasks will be built in the four sections of the middle reaches of the Yellow River mentioned above. Additionally, two dams will be built in the lower reaches of the Yellow River for irrigation, totaling 46 dams.

Based on detailed surveys and thorough research, the Yellow River Mainstream Staircase Development Plan selected Sanmenxia in Shaanxian as the site for the largest and most important comprehensive project for flood control, power generation, and irrigation. Sanmenxia is located east of Shaanxian and west of the famous "Middle Pillar." Two stone islands in the river divide the river into the so-called "Human Gate," "God Gate," and "Ghost Gate" of the "Three Gates." Due to the narrow riverbed and solid rock bottom, it is suitable for building large dams. The planned dam height is about 90 meters, and the water level can be raised to 350 meters above sea level. The water blocked by the dam will form a huge reservoir from Shaanxian upstream to the north of Tongguan, Linjin, and Zhaoyi on both banks of the Yellow River, the two banks of the Wei River from Tongguan west to Linjin, and the two banks of the North Luo River from Dali below. The reservoir's capacity will reach 36 billion cubic meters, second only to the world's largest Kuybyshev Reservoir, equivalent to 3.6 times the capacity of China's largest existing reservoir, Fengman Reservoir (10 billion cubic meters), and 16 times the capacity of Guyuan Reservoir (2.27 billion cubic meters). Its area is approximately 2,350 square kilometers, slightly larger than Taihu Lake (2,200+ square kilometers). In addition, large comprehensive projects will also be built in Longyangxia in Qinghai, Jishixia (Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture), Liujiaxia (Yongjing) in Gansu, and Heishanxia (Zhongwei). Among them, the Liujiaxia Reservoir has a capacity of 49 billion cubic meters.

To complement the Yellow River Mainstream Staircase Development Plan, several reservoirs will also be built on important tributaries of the Yellow River. Some of these will be comprehensive projects, while most will be used to intercept sediment from the tributaries.

After the completion of the series of dams on the Yellow River mainstream and its tributaries, the following changes will occur in the Yellow River basin:

First, the flood disasters of the Yellow River can be completely avoided. A single Sanmenxia Reservoir can reduce the maximum flood flow of the Yellow River from 37,000 cubic meters per second to 8,000 cubic meters per second. An 8,000 cubic meters per second flow can safely pass through the narrow river channel in Shandong and enter the sea. Even if Sanmenxia and the tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Yi River, South Luo River, and Shan River, simultaneously experience such a massive flood, the Sanmenxia Reservoir can close the gates and hold back the entire Yellow River flood for four days. Together with the reservoirs on the Yi River, Luo River, and Shan River, the flow in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can still be reduced to 8,000 cubic meters per second, ensuring the safety of the lower reaches. Moreover, since the sediment of the Yellow River has been intercepted by the Sanmenxia Reservoir and a series of reservoirs on the mainstream and tributaries upstream, the water in the lower reaches will become clear, and the riverbed will gradually deepen and stabilize. Therefore, the various flood control burdens of the people in the lower reaches will be lifted. As for the area above the Hetao, after the completion of the Liujiaxia Reservoir, the maximum flood flow of 8,330 cubic meters per second can be reduced to 5,000 cubic meters per second, thus completely avoiding floods.

Second, utilizing the 46 dams on the Yellow River mainstream can generate 23 million kilowatts of electricity, with an average annual power generation of 11 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to ten times the total power generation of China in 1954. The reservoirs on the tributaries of the Yellow River can also generate electricity. This will provide a cheap power source for the industrial, transportation, and modern agricultural development of Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, electrifying this vast region and saving a large amount of coal for the country.

Third, the large comprehensive water conservancy projects in Longyangxia, Liujiaxia, Heishanxia, and Sanmenxia can all be used for irrigation. The dams planned to be built from Qingtongxia to Hekou Town and below Taohuayu will mainly be used for irrigation. In addition, some reservoirs on the tributaries can also be used for irrigation. Utilizing these projects can create stable water diversion conditions, avoiding excessive river water drop and canal dryness. After building these dams, repairing and constructing a series of canals and other irrigation facilities, the irrigated land area can be expanded from the current 165 million mu to 1.165 billion mu, accounting for 65% of the total land area in the Yellow River basin that needs to be irrigated by the Yellow River. Since the water volume of the Yellow River is insufficient, the irrigation problem of the remaining approximately 35% of the land, in addition to relying on well water and rainwater to solve part of it, also needs to consider diverting water from the Han River or other nearby water systems to supplement the Yellow River water volume to completely solve the problem.

Fourth, after the completion of the 46 dams and the installation of ship passage facilities, the water volume in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River can be adjusted according to needs, thus enabling full-line navigation. Five-hundred-ton tugboats will be able to sail from the estuary to Lanzhou. The transportation conditions in the Yellow River basin will be greatly improved.

In implementing the above staircase development plan, large-scale water and soil conservation work must be carried out simultaneously in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces and other loess areas. This is because the reservoirs on the Yellow River cannot reduce soil erosion in the loess areas, and instead, if soil erosion is not stopped, these reservoirs will be gradually filled with sediment and lose their flood control capabilities. The main task of most of the reservoirs on the tributaries of the Yellow River planned in the plan is to intercept sediment. However, only by carrying out comprehensive water and soil conservation work in the loess areas can the source of sediment be fundamentally stopped; otherwise, the tributary reservoirs will quickly be filled with sediment, and it will not be possible to extend the life of the mainstream reservoirs.

The farmers in the Yellow River basin have also done some water and soil conservation work in the past. For example, in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, southern Gansu, southern Shanxi, and western Henan, terraces have been widely developed. However, it was not until after liberation, especially after the development of agricultural production cooperatives, that systematic water and soil conservation work began in some places under the guidance of the Communist Party and the people's government, and significant results were achieved. In Gangu County, Gansu Province, Niujiaping Village, by building terraces, digging ditches, and excavating ponds in 1,000 mu of hilly land, it was possible to achieve no water runoff and no soil erosion. In August 1954, during a heavy rain of 72 millimeters, there was no flash flood or soil loss. The village's per-mu wheat yield increased from 112 jin to 280 jin due to the adoption of water and soil conservation measures. In Yangjingtou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, which was originally a "barely clothed and barely covered," "chaff and vegetable half-year grain" stony mountain area, forestation was implemented in 1950, and in 1953, under the leadership of the Party and the government, a comprehensive plan was made for all 21,600+ mu of land. This plan stipulated: except for cultivated land and village roads and rivers occupying approximately 6,700 mu, 5,000 mu of pasture, 4,000 mu of pine and cypress forest, 1,000 mu of broad-leaved forest, and 4,900+ mu of fruit forest. On this basis, the village formulated a 15-year development plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, aiming to increase the per capita income to 6,542 jin of grain by 1967, six times that of 1953, with forestry income accounting for 79% of the total income. In addition, the village built a water storage pond to solve the drinking water problem; terraced 70+ mu of hillsides, increasing the yield per mu from the original 150 jin to 250-300 jin; built 198 stone "gutter dams" (small dams built with stones in the gullies) in the gullies, which can gradually silt up 150-200 mu of land, with each mu producing 200-300 jin of grain; built a 4-li-long dike along the downstream of the gully, densely planted willows on both banks to stabilize the gully, and after the rain, clear water flows for 25 days. These typical cases show that water and soil conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is completely feasible.

The comprehensive utilization plan for the Yellow River requires that in the water and soil loss areas of the Yellow River basin, the following series of measures be taken according to local specific conditions:

1. Agricultural technical measures
   1. Improving agricultural cultivation techniques—To enhance the soil's ability to absorb rainwater, deep plowing and weeding after rain are implemented; to enhance soil structure, fertilizers are applied and crop rotation is practiced, etc.
   2. Water and soil conservation farming methods—To prevent rainwater from flowing down the slopes, crops are planted in horizontal ditches, horizontal slope farming is practiced, and horizontal ditches are plowed on fallow land, etc.
   3. Improving soil cover—Dense planting, "equal-height strip intercropping" (such as corn, sorghum, and legumes are planted in strips at the same height on the same horizontal slope), planting "buffer grass strips," planting green manure in summer fallow land, "crop-grass rotation," cultivating pasture, managing grazing, etc.

2. Agricultural soil improvement measures
   1. Field engineering—Building terraces on hillsides, building ridges and level ditches, building field drainage and irrigation systems, building "water sieves" (building terraces in stages in the concave areas of the slope water flow), etc.
   2. Stopping cultivation on steep slopes and planting trees and grass instead.

3. Forestry soil improvement measures
   1. Afforestation in the bottom and slopes of gullies, on river banks and river beaches, on the banks of reservoirs, and on saline-alkali land.
   2. Establishing "windbreak and sand-fixing forests for protecting fields."
   3. Closing mountains for afforestation and planting trees on hillsides and hilly areas.

4. Water conservancy soil improvement measures
   1. Building embankments at the head and sides of gullies to prevent gully development.
   2. Building "gutter dams," "siltation dams" (building dams to intercept sediment and form farmland), and large earth dams in the gullies.
   3. Building "water-flooded land" (diverting sediment-laden water into enclosed sandbars, allowing sediment to settle, and then draining the clear water).
   4. Developing small-scale irrigation.
   5. Building ponds to intercept rainwater and sediment, and building cisterns to store rainwater.

After the complete implementation of this plan, the appearance of the loess area will be greatly changed, and agricultural production as well as forestry and animal husbandry production in this area will be greatly increased. The farmers of northern Shaanxi have sung a folk song about this future: "The distant mountains are forested, the nearby mountains are fruited. The plains are transformed into grain-producing lands, and the dry gullies are dammed to form wetlands. The slopes are planted with pasture, and the hillsides are terraced." They sing correctly. But there is something even more important: from now on, the sediment deposition problem of the entire Yellow River mainstream and its tributaries, the extension of the life of the reservoirs, and the flood problem of the entire Yellow River will all be favorably resolved.

Due to the large capacity of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the sediment-intercepting dams on the tributaries of the Yellow River, and especially the water and soil conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the Sanmenxia Reservoir can be maintained for at least 50 to 70 years or even longer. By that time, due to other series of measures, the flood disasters of the Yellow River will have been greatly reduced. As for the difficulties that may arise in power generation, irrigation, and navigation after the Sanmenxia Reservoir is silted up, they are relatively easy to solve.

The above is a general outline of the long-term plan for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River. It is clear that the complete realization of this long-term plan will take several decades. For example, the complete realization of the long-term plan for water and soil conservation will take 50 years. To solve the most urgent problems of flood control, power generation, irrigation, and other aspects of the Yellow River, the Yellow River Planning Commission proposes the following plan as the first-phase plan to be implemented within the three five-year plans, i.e., by 1967.

The first-phase plan stipulates that the first step is to build comprehensive projects at Sanmenxia downstream in Shaanxian and Liujiaxia upstream in Lanzhou. The Sanmenxia project has a decisive role in preventing flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, as mentioned earlier. The water level of the Sanmenxia Reservoir can be 70 meters higher than the water level below the dam. The power station built there can generate 1 million kilowatts of electricity using such a high "water head," with an average annual power generation of 4.6 billion kilowatt-hours, which can meet the needs of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces for a considerable period in industry and other aspects. The Sanmenxia Reservoir can adjust the minimum flow in the lower reaches during the dry season of the Yellow River from 197 cubic meters per second to 500 cubic meters per second, ensuring the water needed for irrigation and navigation in the lower reaches of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong near the riverbank. Although the Liujiaxia Reservoir is much smaller than Sanmenxia, its "water head" is 107 meters high, and the power station there can also generate 1 million kilowatts of electricity, with an average annual power generation of 5.23 billion kilowatt-hours, which can meet the electricity needs of the newly developed industrial areas in Gansu. The Liujiaxia Reservoir can raise the minimum flow of the river from 200 cubic meters per second to 465 cubic meters per second, thus ensuring the irrigation and navigation needs of the lower reaches in the original Ningxia and Suiyuan provinces.

Since the river water is intercepted by the dams, forming huge reservoirs, it is inevitable that some original residential areas will be submerged, so it is necessary for the residents of these places to move to other places for the benefit of all and for their own long-term interests. The Liujiaxia Reservoir, due to its smaller size and sparser population, only requires the relocation of 27,000 people. The Sanmenxia Reservoir, due to the need to intercept a particularly large flood flow, will submerge 2 million mu of cultivated land and relocate 600,000 residents when the water level reaches 350 meters. Of course, this cannot be compared with the losses caused by the Yellow River's flooding and breaching: flooding and breaching will cause loss of life, and property losses are incalculable; relocation is carried out under the leadership and assistance of the people's government in a planned manner, and the government guarantees that the relocated people will have appropriate production and living conditions after reaching the relocation site. Therefore, in the past, when building reservoirs or opening flood detention and storage areas, the local residents were able to follow the needs of society and the government's arrangements and complete the relocation or temporary relocation plans smoothly. However, relocating 600,000 people is indeed a great challenge. At the same time, the water level of the reservoir does not need to be raised to 350 meters immediately in the initial stage of the reservoir's operation, but only to 335.5 meters. Therefore, initially, only 215,000 people need to be relocated, and the remaining residents can be gradually relocated over the next 15 to 20 years as needed. There is no doubt that these relocated residents will be greatly appreciated by the 80 million people threatened by Yellow River disasters, and the government will strive to ensure that they do not suffer losses during the relocation and help them quickly settle down and live and work in peace after reaching the relocation site.

To intercept the sediment from the tributaries above Sanmenxia and protect the Sanmenxia Reservoir, it is necessary to build five reservoirs in appropriate locations on the Jing River, Hulu River, North Luo River, Wuding River, and Yuan River in the first-phase project. In the first-phase project, comprehensive reservoirs will also be built on the Fen River and Ba River.

As mentioned earlier, the Sanmenxia project, although built upstream of the Yi River, South Luo River, and Shan River, cannot guarantee that these three tributaries will not cause downstream floods when they simultaneously experience floods. Therefore, in the first-phase project, it is also necessary to select one or more appropriate locations on these tributaries to build flood control reservoirs.

The Sanmenxia Reservoir and power station are scheduled to start construction in 1957 and be completed in 1961. The Soviet government has agreed to undertake the design of this massive project. Korolyov, the head of the Soviet expert team assisting China in the Yellow River planning, will continue to be responsible for this design.

The reservoirs on the tributaries downstream of Sanmenxia are also scheduled to be completed by 1964. However, to prevent floods larger than those in 1933 from occurring before these projects are completed, a series of temporary flood control measures must still be taken in the lower reaches. Therefore, in the next few years, it is necessary to continue to raise and strengthen the levees in the lower reaches, strengthen and expand the facilities in the flood detention areas, and continue to strengthen flood control work.

In terms of irrigation, the first-phase plan stipulates the construction of three main stream dams at Qingtongxia (Gansu Jinji), Dukuangtang (Inner Mongolia Dukuang), and Taohuayu (Henan Chenggao), and the corresponding canal projects in these areas. According to the first-phase plan, 30.25 million mu of irrigated land will be expanded, including 2.1 million mu in Qinghai, 20.5 million mu in Gansu, 42.1 million mu in Inner Mongolia, 22.6 million mu in Shaanxi, 9 million mu in Shanxi, 96 million mu in Henan, 40 million mu in Hebei, and 70.2 million mu in Shandong. At the same time, the irrigation conditions of the original 119.8 million mu of irrigated areas will be improved.

The completion of the first-phase plan will enable the 703-kilometer section from the estuary to Taohuayu in Henan, the 843-kilometer section from Qingshuihe in Inner Mongolia to Yinchuan in Ningxia, and the two sections within the Sanmenxia Reservoir and the Liujiaxia Reservoir to be navigable. The navigable distance will account for approximately half of the total length of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River.

In terms of water and soil conservation in the Yellow River basin, the first-phase plan stipulates improving the cultivation of 127 million mu of land, 8.7 million mu of grassland rotation, improving 1.346 billion mu of natural grasslands, cultivating 6.7 million mu of artificial grasslands, planting 2 million mu of orchards, stopping cultivation on 11 million mu of steep slopes; building 28 million mu of terraces, 14 million mu of terraces with ditches, 14.7 million mu of ridged fields, 17 million mu of level ditch fields, 3.6 million mu of large water sieves; planting 21 million mu of trees, cultivating 700,000 mu of seedlings, closing 366 million mu of mountains for afforestation; building 37,000 water cisterns, 20 million cubic meters of ponds, 16,000 water storage weirs, 215,000 gully head protection facilities, 638,000 gutter dams, 790,000 siltation dams, implementing 47.6 million mu of small-scale irrigation, building 10 million mu of water-flooded land, building 300 large gully dams, and repairing 4,300 kilometers of gully roads. This is also a massive plan. It requires the active support of the broad masses of farmers and the joint investment of the government and farmers. The implementation of this plan will double the agricultural production in the area, and the sediment of the Yellow River will be reduced by half after the completion of this plan and the construction of sediment-intercepting reservoirs on the tributaries.

To implement the first-phase project of the comprehensive Yellow River plan, the initial estimate requires an investment of 5.324 billion yuan. Among them: 1.22 billion yuan for the Sanmenxia Reservoir and power station (including relocation costs, the same below), 4.16 billion yuan for the Liujiaxia Reservoir and power station; 5 billion yuan for power transmission and transformation equipment; 3.04 billion yuan for the flood control reservoirs on the South Luo River, Shan River, and Yi River, and 270 million yuan for temporary flood control measures in the lower reaches; 8.07 billion yuan for the construction of the irrigation system, 2.81 billion yuan for the construction of three main stream dams for irrigation, and 1.56 billion yuan for two comprehensive tributary dams; 7.32 billion yuan for water and soil conservation measures, 6.76 billion yuan for sediment-intercepting reservoirs on the tributaries; 2.05 billion yuan for navigation equipment. This is a large investment. However, this investment is completely worthwhile. After the completion of the first-phase plan, just from the perspective of irrigation, 54.7 billion jin of grain and 4 billion jin of cotton can be increased annually, with the value of these two increases reaching 8.56 billion yuan per year, 85.6 billion yuan in ten years, far exceeding the total investment over 15 years. In terms of power generation, the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia power stations can generate 98 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually (initially 66 billion kilowatt-hours), not to mention the great contribution this large amount of power generation will make to production development. Just the price of electricity, if calculated at the current price of approximately 6 fen per kilowatt-hour, is worth 5.88 billion yuan, and the income over ten years will also exceed the total investment over 15 years. It should be noted that the construction costs of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia power stations are particularly low. The amount of concrete and earthwork required for the construction of the power stations, if allocated to each thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity generated, is 0.357 cubic meters of concrete and 0.446 cubic meters of earthwork for Sanmenxia, and 0.232 cubic meters of concrete and 0.325 cubic meters of earthwork for Liujiaxia. In comparison, the Kuybyshev power station requires 0.8 cubic meters of concrete and 15.6 cubic meters of earthwork for each thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity generated. If one-third of the investment in the Sanmenxia project and half of the investment in the Liujiaxia project are considered as power generation costs, then the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity for Sanmenxia is only 3.3 fen, and for Liujiaxia, it is only 2.3 fen, while the current average cost of thermal power generation in China is 3 fen per kilowatt-hour. It is clear that the completion of the first-phase plan will also produce huge economic benefits in terms of navigation. Moreover, the first-phase plan fundamentally solves the flood disaster problem of the Yellow River, and just the cost of flood control can save 20 million yuan per year, not to mention the avoidance of losses of people's lives and property and the benefits obtained in various aspects, which cannot be expressed in numbers!

The Chinese people have long hoped to control the Yellow River and utilize it. While implementing the method of sending away water and sediment for river control, the idea of controlling water and sediment and utilizing it has also been proposed since ancient times. For example, in the 7th year BC, Jia Yan of the Western Han Dynasty proposed to Emperor Cheng of Han an unadopted suggestion to build a 300-li stone dike on the north bank of the Yellow River near the present-day Xunxian, Henan Province, with many water gates and canals built below the dike, "in drought, open the eastern water gate to irrigate Hebei, in flood, open the western high gate to divide the river flow." Modern water conservancy scholar Li Yizhi first pointed out the necessity of controlling the river from the middle reaches and proposed two methods for controlling sediment in the middle reaches: "(1) Preventing erosion to reduce its source. (2) Building gutter dams to intercept its path." Their ideals could only be realized in our era, the era of people's democracy under Mao Zedong—of course, at a much higher level. The Nationalist government invited American experts LeBard, Savanich, and Groth in 1946, who, in their "Initial Report on the Control of the Yellow River," although acknowledging the importance of water and soil conservation work, believed that "to promote it in the entire region and take effect, it may take hundreds of years." This cannot but remind us of the words of the people of the Zhou Dynasty: "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will people live!" But now we do not need hundreds of years, only a few decades, to see the effect of water and soil conservation work in the entire loess area; and it only takes six years, after the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, to see the water in the lower reaches of the Yellow River basically clear. The representatives present and the people of the whole country will not have to wait long to see the day that the people have dreamed of for thousands of years in the lower reaches of the Yellow River—the day when the "Yellow River clears"!

Representatives! From the above explanation, it can be seen that the comprehensive plan for controlling the water disasters of the Yellow River and developing water resources is, like the other projects in the overall socialist construction plan we are discussing, indeed a great plan, indeed a plan worthy of the hard work of the people of the whole country.

To achieve this plan, of course, it is first necessary for the relevant government departments, such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Machinery Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other relevant departments, to work together. In the first-phase plan of this plan, there are still many projects that need further surveys and research to determine. The engineering projects that have been determined need to start the design. The Sanmenxia project, which is designed by the Soviet Union, requires our relevant departments to be responsible for providing the necessary data for the design and actively carry out the necessary construction preparations and relocation preparations for the reservoir area. To achieve the requirements of the first phase of water and soil conservation, the relevant departments should actively guide the local people's governments to formulate specific plans and implement them correctly.

However, to achieve this plan, it is not only necessary for the government to work hard but also for the people of the whole country to work hard. There is no doubt that the people of the whole country will firmly support this great plan in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The people of the Yellow River basin will make the greatest contribution in the process of implementing this plan. The farmers of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, the people's committees at all levels of the provinces, counties, and townships of the three provinces, the local organizations of the Communist Party and various democratic parties, and the various people's organizations at all levels of the three provinces are responsible for the implementation of the water and soil conservation plan. We believe that for their own interests, the interests of their local areas, and the interests of the people of the whole country, they will definitely be able to fully assume their responsibilities. The residents of the Sanmenxia Reservoir area and other reservoir areas, with the virtue of "one family moving, saving thousands of families," will also move according to the government's instructions and actively help the implementation of this great plan to control and develop the Yellow River.

The formulation of the Yellow River plan shows that China's water conservancy industry is rapidly advancing. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a lot of work has been done in the field of water conservancy, and significant achievements have been made, such as the large-scale projects of controlling the Huai River and the Jingjiang flood diversion. The comprehensive plan for the Yellow River, which has made overall plans for flood control, power generation, irrigation, water and soil conservation, and navigation in the entire basin, more vividly demonstrates the great role of rivers in the development of the national economy. We not only want to control and develop the Yellow River but also want to control and develop the Yangtze River and other major rivers. The planning of the Yangtze River will collect data during the first five-year plan period and formulate plans and gradually implement them during the second five-year plan period. The government proposed to the Soviet government in October 1954 the request to invite an expert team to assist China in the planning of the Yangtze River. The Soviet government has once again generously agreed to our request. The Soviet government decided to send 12 experts to help us with the planning of the Yangtze River. The team leader, B. M. Dmitriev, and six other experts have already arrived in China. The Soviet Union has provided us with tremendous assistance in the planning of the Yellow River, the design of the Sanmenxia project, and the planning of the Yangtze River. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to express our deep gratitude to our great ally, the Soviet government and people, for their assistance!

With the united support of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the whole country, and with the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, we will definitely be able to conquer the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and other rivers, making them serve the interests of the Chinese people and the great cause of socialism!

The State Council, based on the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, requests the National People's Congress to adopt the principles and basic contents of the Yellow River plan and pass a resolution requiring the relevant government departments and the people of the whole country, especially the people of the Yellow River basin, to work together to ensure the implementation of its first-phase project as planned.

    关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告
    ——在一九五五年七月十八日的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理  邓子恢各位代表！
    现在我代表国务院作关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告。因为这一规划所涉及的不止五年，它的第一期工程就需要到一九六七年才能完成，所以需要作为第一个五年计划以外的单独的问题来讨论。
    黄河问题是全国人民所关心的。黄河是我国第二大河，从青海的约古宗列渠发源，流经青海、甘肃（包括原宁夏省）、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、山东等省区，在山东利津以东入海，全长四千八百四十五公里。黄河流域的面积，按自然地理的观点计算（以地面的水是否流入黄河来划分流域的界限），是七十四万五千平方公里。我们在这里为着经济统计上的便利，仍按过去习惯，把黄河所经青海省、甘肃省、内蒙古自治区原绥远省部分、陕西省、山西省、河南省、山东省的全境，加上同黄河密切相关的河北省的全境，都算作黄河流域的范围。黄河流域是我国历史的发源地和文化的摇篮，在一个长时期内是全国政治和经济的中心。据一九五四年统计，黄河流域共有耕地面积六亿五千六百万亩，占全国耕地面积百分之四十；其中，小麦播种面积占全国的百分之六十一·七，各种杂粮播种面积占全国的百分之三十七至六十三不等，棉花播种面积占全国的百分之五十七，烟叶播种面积占全国的百分之六十七。黄河流域的地下富源有煤、石油、铁、铜、铝和其他大量矿藏。在黄河流域各省区，工业正在迅速发展，许多新的工业城市和工业基地正在建设中。
    黄河流域还有一项非常重要的资源，这就是黄河水系本身。根据近几十年的水文观测资料，黄河的多年平均水量约为四百七十亿公方（立方公尺），虽然只约有长江的多年平均水量的二十分之一，但是只要充分利用，却可以把灌溉区域扩大到一亿一千六百万亩土地，在这个灌溉区域内可以使粮食增产一百三十七亿斤，棉花增产十二亿斤。在黄河水量得到适当的调节以后，黄河在青海贵德以下直到海口还可以通航。黄河的水力尤其宝贵。黄河河源比海平面高出四千三百六十八公尺，仅从青海贵德以下的水力就可以发电二千三百万瓩，每年能发电一千一百亿度（瓩时），对黄河流域的工业发展以至整个国家工业化和电气化事业有伟大的意义。黄河由于地形优越，大多数水电站的造价都比其他地方低廉；至于发电成本，可以低到等于目前我国火力发电成本的十分之一左右。
    但是黄河目前的状况还不能作出这样伟大的贡献。虽然黄河流域正在发展为巨大的工业区，黄河的水力发电却完全没有开始。黄河沿岸的灌溉区现在只有一千六百五十万亩，而且在大部分地方设备陈旧，不能保证灌溉的需要。黄河上现在没有现代化的航运，只在个别的互相隔离的河段上通行载重十吨至七十五吨的木船以及皮筏。不但如此，黄河还常常成为黄河流域以及全国的一个大威胁。
    黄河是古今中外著名的一条灾害性的河流。它的灾害主要是水灾。黄河流域雨量很少，平均全年只降雨四百公厘，约为长江中游的地区平均全年雨量的三分之一，东南沿海地区平均全年雨量的四分之一。但是黄河流域每年降雨量的一半左右经常集中在夏季的七八两月，在这个期间有时一个地方一个月甚至可以下七八百公厘；并且夏季的雨多是暴雨，有时一个地方一天可以下一百五十公厘。这种夏季的集中的暴雨经常造成洪水暴涨，称为
  “伏汛”。黄河在陕西境内支流很多，如果夏季暴雨的面积较大，几个支流同时涨水，就会造成特大的洪水。如黄河在河南陕县的多年平均流量每秒只有
  一千三百公方，但在一九三三年夏季的最大洪水流量曾达到二万二千秒公方，在一八四三年（清道光二十三年）的最大洪水流量据专家推算则达三万六千秒公方左右，因而都造成极严重的水灾。黄河的水灾大部分是这种夏季暴雨造成的。此外，有时九十月间也可能有大雨造成洪水，称为“秋汛”。三四月间，冰雪融化也常引起洪水，称为“桃汛”。黄河在甘肃、内蒙古边境和山东境内是由南向北流的，在南部化冰的季节北部往往还在封冻，大量流冰在下游被阻，拥塞河道，也会造成河水暴涨，称为“凌汛”。
    黄河的水灾之所以特别严重，不但是因为黄河流域的夏季暴雨，更重要的还是由于黄河下游（指由沁河口到海口的一段；由青海贵德到沁河口称为中游；贵德以上称为上游）的泥沙淤积。黄河所以叫黄河，就因为它是一条泥沙河；俗语说“跳下黄河洗不清”，就表现了它的这个特点。黄河的含沙量在世界各国的河流中占第一位。每公方水的多年平均含沙量在埃及尼罗河是一公斤，苏联阿姆河是四公斤，美国科罗拉多河是十公斤，而黄河在河南陕县却达到三十四公斤。根据水文资料计算，黄河每年经过陕县带到下游和海口的泥沙平均达到十三亿八千万吨，体积约折合九亿二千万公方；如果用这么多泥沙堆成高宽各一公尺的土坝，足够绕地球赤道二十三周！黄河既然有这样多泥沙，到了下游由于河道平缓，泥沙不能完全入海而大量沉积，河身就逐年淤浅，直至高出河堤两旁的地面，成为“地上河”。泥沙河在泥沙滩上行走，河槽当然很难固定。海口淤积的大量泥沙也逐年伸展，这不但使入海的水道本身变化无常，而且加重了整个黄河下游的危机。因此遇到较大的洪水，河堤无法约束的时候，黄河下游就要发生泛滥、决口以至改道的严重灾害。
    由于上述情况，黄河虽然在中游也有水灾，但严重的水灾却集中在下游。据历史记载，黄河下游在三千多年中发生泛滥、决口一千五百多次，重要的改道二十六次，其中大的改道九次。改道最北的经海河出大沽口，最南的经淮河入长江。因此黄河的灾害一直波及海河流域、淮河流域和长江下游，威胁二十五万平方公里上八千余万人口的安全。黄河的每次泛滥、决口和改道都造成人民生命财产的惨重损失，常常有整个村镇甚至整个城市人口被大部或全部淹没的惨事。一九三三年的洪水造成决口五十余处，受灾面积一万一千余平方公里，受灾人口三百六十四万余人，死亡一万八千余人，损失财产以当时银洋计约合二亿三千万元。一九三八年蒋介石政府在河南郑州附近掘开南岸花园口河堤，造成黄河大改道，受灾面积五万四千平方公里，受灾人口一千二百五十万人，死亡八十九万人。由此可见黄河灾害的严重程度。
    黄河的灾害同反动统治阶级的罪恶是分不开的。黄河下游的命运在人民民主时代得到了显著的转变。中国共产党和人民政府领导人民群众对黄河的灾害作了顽强的斗争。从一九四六年花园口复堤起，黄河两岸解放区人民政府就积极领导人民防治黄河的水害。在过去九年中，人民政府培修了黄河共一千八百公里（包括南北大堤，南北金堤和沁河堤），完成了土方一亿三千万公方；将原有保护堤坡的“坝埽”由秸料换成石料，共用了石料二百三十万公方；在大堤上用锥探的方法发现了八万个洞穴和裂缝，都已经加以填补。这样，就根本改变了原有河堤残破卑薄、百孔千疮的狼狈形象——这种形象正是反动统治阶级腐败无能和玩忽人命的象征。共产党和人民政府在每年黄河下游汛期都积极地领导当地人民从事护堤防汛工作，人民解放军也积极参加了这个斗争。在护堤防汛的斗争中涌现了很多勇敢勤劳、不怕困难危险的英雄模范。在一九四九年九月黄河洪水情况严重的时候，下游的居民和驻军四十万人曾在党和政府的领导下不分昼夜地轮流防守黄河大堤约一个月之久，终于胜利地渡过了危险。此外，由于山东河道窄狭，不能排泄大量洪水，人民政府在山东东平湖两侧建立了可以从黄河临时分出洪水约三千秒公方的滞洪区；又在河南长垣到山东寿张的黄河大堤和大堤北面的金堤之间建立了可以临时分出洪水五千秒公方的大型滞洪区，并在它的入口长垣石头庄地方建立了控制滞洪区的溢洪堰。为了减轻凌汛的威胁，除在凌汛期间对冰块组织打冰、爆破、炮轰和飞机轰炸外，还在山东利津小街子地方建立了防凌溢水堰。依靠了这一切努力，我们扭转了黄河近百年间几乎每年决口的险恶局面，保证了黄河下游九年来的安全。
    以下的比较，可以说明黄河在解放前后的变化：在国民党时期，一九三四年的洪水最大流量（以郑州附近秦厂的流量为准，下同）只有八千五百秒公方，黄河却在河南长垣决口四处，淹及六个县。
  一九三五年的洪水最大流量达到一万三千三百秒公方，黄河又在山东鄄城大决口，淹及山东、江苏十几个县，受灾二百余万人。但是在中华人民共和国成立以后，一九五四年的洪水最大流量达到一万四千秒公方，黄河却安然无恙。
    但是我们能否说黄河水害已经消除了呢？绝对不能这样说。相反，我们要看到，黄河水害在历史上是不断严重化的。从一○四八年（北宋中叶，仁宗庆历八年）黄河第五次大改道到一八五五年（清咸丰五年）的八百零七年中间，大改道就发生了三次；从一八五五年到现在的一百年间，决口就发生了二百次。这里主要的原因是黄河下游泥沙淤积的与日俱增。据近年的实际测量，黄河下游河身每年升高一公分至一公寸不等；有的地方，目前河滩竟比地面高出十公尺。海口淤积的泥沙作四十公里宽的扇面形推进，在一九四九年到一九五一年的三年间曾推进了十公里。泥沙淤积得这样快，单靠河堤加高加固是显然不能解决问题的；而且从一种意义上来说，河堤愈是加高加固，河道内的泥沙因为不能向河堤两旁排泄，淤积也就愈快。因此，在这种恶性循环的状况下，泛滥、决口、改道的危险仍然是完全存在的。我们现在的溢洪堰工程比较简易，只能对付暴涨暴落的洪水，并且修建的时候只以一九三三年的洪水为目标，当时还没有发现一八四三年洪水比一九三三年更大一半的事实。一八四三年的洪水，据当时记载，曾在四十四小时内陡涨二丈零八寸，从河南阌乡涨起，到中牟溢出河堤，经河南东部、安徽北部注入洪泽湖，沿途灾情极为惨重。这次水灾至今还以恐怖的色彩流传在陕县一带的歌谣中，这首歌谣说：“道光二十三，黄河涨上天，冲走太阳渡，捎带万锦滩。”我们必须解决黄河的泥沙淤积问题，彻底治理黄河的水害，使黄河永远不泛滥、不决口、不改道，才能确保无数的太阳渡、万锦滩，确保黄河下游以至海河流域、淮河流域和长江下游千百万人民的安全。
    在黄河流域，除了严重的水害以外，还有中游地区的水土流失的严重危害和整个流域的严重的旱灾。
    在甘肃东部、陕西的大部、山西的大部以至河南西部的一部，每年都有大量土壤遭受损失。土壤的损失大部分是由于雨水特别是暴雨的冲刷，小部分是由于风力的剥蚀。据陕西绥德水土保持实验站的观测，绥德林家嶮降雨十五分钟，雨量十六公厘，在观测区内平均冲刷土壤二·六公厘；同县万马沟降雨六分钟，雨量十六公厘，在观测区内平均冲刷土壤三·八公厘。在黄河中游土壤流失严重地区，每平方公里每年约损失土壤一万吨，地面每年平均约降低一公分。在整个黄河中游地区每年每平方公里土壤约被冲刷三千七百吨，比全世界每年每平方公里土壤被冲刷的平均数量一百三十四吨大二十六倍。据分析的结果，这些被冲刷的土壤每吨含氮素○·八至一·五公斤，磷肥一·五公斤，钾肥二十公斤。由于这种严重的侵蚀，在甘肃、陕西、山西的大片肥沃的高原逐渐被冲成许多坡度很陡、深达两三百公尺的沟壑；然后，由于沟壑不断地增加和扩大，平地逐渐丧失，被割成无数长条形的“山梁”和圆顶形的“山峁”，成为“丘陵沟壑地带”；而在少数侵蚀最严重的地区，有些丘陵上的土壤也已经大部丧失，开始变为荒瘠的石山。这种演变的过程多少年来不断地在上述区域进行着，使这一区域的宜耕面积逐渐缩小，土壤肥力逐渐减少，农作物产量低下，广大农民的生活条件不容易有大的改善。
    黄河流域虽然受着暴雨造成的灾害，但是整个雨量是很不够的；有些地方由于雨量特少，如甘肃北部和内蒙古西南部，已成为沙漠区或半沙漠区。雨量不足使黄河的水量不足。特别在每年十一月到下年五、六月，河水低落，平均每月流量只占全年流量的百分之三到百分之五。中游由于沟壑多，陡坡多，地面缺少森林和牧草来吸水，又缺少池塘湖泊来蓄水，所以雨水在地面流失很多，河水容易暴涨，也容易暴落，正是所谓“易涨易落山溪水”。此外，利用黄河进行灌溉虽然早在两千多年前就已经开始（甘肃省原宁夏境内的秦渠、汉渠都还存在），但直到现在还很不发展。由于这些原因，黄河流域常常遭受旱灾。在清朝的二百六十八年中，黄河流域曾发生过旱灾二百零一次。一八七六至一八七九年（清光绪二年至五年），山西、河北、山东、河南四省旱灾，死亡一千三百多万人。一九二○年上述四省和陕西共有三百十七县大旱，灾民二千万人，死亡五十万人。一九二九年黄河流域又有大旱，灾民达三千四百万人。
    黄河流域由于旱灾、水灾和水土流失，农业生产受到很大的损害。这些损害在解放以后虽然有了减轻，但是由于人民政府在短期间还不可能对黄河流域实施大规模的有系统的改造自然条件的计划，黄河流域的农业生产还是遭到一些特殊的困难。黄河流域的谷物播种面积虽约占全国的百分之三十八，却因为每亩粮食产量平均只有一百二十多斤，在水土流失严重地区只有几十斤，所以粮食产量只占全国百分之二十八左右。消除黄河的各种灾害，增加黄河流域的谷物产量，是解决我国粮食问题所应当采取的重要措施之一。
    那末，现在我们在黄河问题上的任务是什么呢？
    根据以上所说的黄河的资源和灾害的各方面情况，我们的任务就是不但要从根本上治理黄河的水害，而且要同时制止黄河流域的水土流失和消除黄河流域的旱灾；不但要消除黄河的水旱灾害，尤其要充分利用黄河的水利资源来进行灌溉、发电和通航，来促进农业、工业和运输业的发展。总之，我们要彻底征服黄河，改造黄河流域的自然条件，以便从根本上改变黄河流域的经济面貌，满足现在的社会主义建设时代和将来的共产主义建设时代整个国民经济对于黄河资源的要求。
    我们应当采取什么方针和方法来达到这个目的呢？
    在我国历史上，广大的人民曾经不断地同黄河的水害作过伟大的斗争。人民群众单只在河南、山东现在的黄河两岸就筑了一千八百公里的河堤，这个河堤至今还是我们同黄河水害作斗争的主要武器。至于历次黄河旧道的两岸，也筑过许多河堤，就不易计算了。黄河下游沿岸的千百万居民每逢汛期就进行紧张的防汛工作，发生了水灾就同水灾斗争，到了灾后又努力恢复农业生产和其他方面的生产。正因为这样，黄河下游地区远在春秋战国时期，就是我国人口稠密、经济发展的重要地区之一。大禹治河的传说充分反映了我国古代人民反抗洪水的英勇精神。传说中禹的父亲鲧治水九年不成，被舜所杀；禹继续父业，娶后三日而出，八年于外，三过其门而不入。
      “我若不把洪水治平，
    我怎奈天下的苍生？”（郭沫若：“洪水时代”）禹的这种伟大的抱负，至今还激动着人们的心。由于黄河经常泛滥决口，历代的政府花了很多钱来修复河堤，并且常常设专门的官吏来管理治河的工作。这些官吏虽然许多是腐败和贪污的，但是也有一部分人是认真办事的，他们曾经用毕生的精力来求得黄河的安全。其中特出的如十六世纪后半期
  （明嘉靖到万历）的潘季驯，十七世纪后半期（清康熙）的靳辅、陈潢，对于黄河下游的修堤防汛工作，都曾有过重大的贡献。
    但是一切过去时代治理黄河的人都没有能从根本上解决黄河问题。这是因为他们限于社会的条件和科学的、技术的条件，只是想办法在黄河下游送走水，送走泥沙。禹“凿龙门”“疏九河”的神话，表示送走水、送走泥沙的想法和做法是很古老的。潘季驯提出的“筑堤束水，以水攻沙”的著名口号，也仍然没有超出这个范围。当然，在不能根治黄河的条件下，在下游“束水”总比任水泛滥好，“攻沙”总比任沙淤积好。但是事实已经证明，水和泥沙是“送”不完的，送走水、送走泥沙的方针是不能根本解决问题的。在今天的科学的、技术的条件下，我们人民政权如果还沿用这个方针来治理黄河，那就是完全错误的了。我们今天在黄河问题上必须求得彻底解决，通盘解决，不但要根除水害，而且要开发水利。从这个要求出发，我们对于黄河所应当采取的方针就不是把水和泥沙送走，而是要对水和泥沙加以控制，加以利用。
    为什么呢？这是因为：第一，黄河下游的水灾和中游的水土流失以至中下游的旱灾是互相关联的，它们在根本上都是由于没有能够控制水和泥沙的结果；不解决水和泥沙的控制问题，就不能根本解决黄河的灾害问题。第二，只要我们能够控制黄河的水和泥沙，它们就不但不能成灾，而且能为我们造无穷的幸福。
    大家知道，黄河下游因为河身抬高，除由沂蒙山区流入东平湖的汶河以外，就没有支流，所以黄河的洪水基本上是从中游来的。但是黄河下游的泥沙又是从哪里来的呢？清朝初年的陈潢曾经解释说：“其挟沙而浊者，皆由经历既远，容纳无算，又遭西北沙松土散之区，于焉流愈疾，而水愈浊。”科学的观测证明，这个意见大致是正确的；黄河的泥沙基本上也是从中游而来，特别是从黄河河套向南折，流经山西、陕西两省间的峡谷地带的时候由各支流带来的。黄河上游的水是清的，到兰州每公方多年平均含沙量也只有三公斤，到包头还只有六公斤。而到了陕西中部的龙门，由于接受了许多含沙量特大的支流（例如无定河每公方水多年平均含沙
  一百四十五公斤），每公方多年平均含沙量就增加到二十八公斤。在龙门以下注入黄河的支流，如从山西来的汾河，从甘肃、陕西流来的洛河（以下为别于河南的洛河称为北洛河）、泾河、渭河，含沙量都很大（泾河每公方水多年平均含沙一百六十一公斤），因此到河南陕县的时候，每公方多年平均含沙量又增加到三十四公斤，最大的含沙量则达到五百八十公斤。在陕县以下，虽然从南岸注入的支流伊河、洛河（以下为别于陕西的洛河称为南洛河）也还含有每公方多年平均六公斤的泥沙，黄河的含沙量却不再增加，而且由于逐段淤积而减少。根据测算，在陕县黄河的巨量泥沙中，来自河套的河口镇以上的只占百分之一○·九。来自河口镇至龙门
  一段的占百分之四九·一，来自龙门至陕县的占百分之四○。这就是说，黄河的泥沙几乎全部是中游来的，而且几乎十分之九是从甘肃、陕西、山西境内的支流来的。
    黄河中游地区的泥沙为什么大量流入黄河？原来我国西起六盘山、贺兰山，北起阴山，东至太行山，南至秦岭，有一个世界上最大的黄土区域，这个区域基本上就是黄河的中游地区。由于黄土“沙松土散”，特别容易受侵蚀；由于黄河中游暴雨特别多，侵蚀的力量特别大；由于黄土高原被侵蚀后形成了很多陡坡，陡坡更容易被暴雨冲刷；又由于地面上的森林被滥伐，陡坡被滥垦，土壤缺少保护，被侵蚀的过程更加迅速：——一切这些因素，就使黄河中游地区的泥沙每年不停地大量地流入黄河，使黄河中游原有的一望无际的平坦肥美的高原逐渐变为瘦削的丘陵，使黄河下游的河道淤积不已，变化无常，使黄河成为世界上泥沙最多和最难治理的河流。
    由此可见，黄河下游的“沙”其实并不是什么沙，而是极为宝贵的黄土。由此可见，造成黄河下游水灾的最根本的原因也就是甘肃、陕西、山西三省的水土流失。而水土流失也是黄河流域旱灾的重要原因之一。
    黄土高原的泥沙下泻是一个已经进行了多少万年的自然过程。从地质的历史上说，今天的华北平原以至淮河平原主要地都是黄河和它的支流冲积的产物。但是这个自然过程对已经定居在平原或高原上的人类造成了一系列严重的灾难。我们今天认识了自然界的这个法则，就必须依据自然界的法则来改变它们发生作用的过程和结果。
    斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中曾说过一段著名的话：“在上古时代，江河泛滥、洪水横流以及由此引起的房屋和庄稼的毁灭，曾认为是人们无法避免的灾害。可是，后来随着人类知识的发展，当人们学会了修筑堤坝和水电站的时候，就能使社会防止在从前看来是无法防止的水灾。不但如此，人们还学会了制止自然的破坏力，可以说是学会了驾驭它们，使水力转而为社会造福，利用水来灌溉田地，取得动力。”我们今天所要做的工作正是如此。
    既然黄河下游的洪水和泥沙基本上是从中游来的，而中游又极端需要这些水和泥沙，我们就应当在中游把水和泥沙控制起来。怎样才能控制它们呢？
    为了在黄河的干流和支流内并在黄河流域的地面上控制水和泥沙，需要依靠两个方法：第一，在黄河的干流和支流上修建一系列的拦河坝和水库。依靠这些拦河坝和水库，我们可以拦蓄洪水和泥沙，防止水害；可以调节水量，发展灌溉和航运；更重要的是可以建设一系列不同规模的水电站，取得大量的廉价的动力。第二，在黄河流域水土流失严重的地区，主要地是甘肃、陕西、山西三省，展开大规模的水土保持工作。这就是说，要保护黄土使它不受雨水的冲刷，拦蓄雨水使它不要冲下山沟和冲入河流，这样既避免了中游地区的水土流失，也消除了下游水害的根源。
    从高原到山沟，从支流到干流，节节蓄水，分段拦泥，尽一切可能把河水用在工业、农业和运输业上，把黄土和雨水留在农田上：——这就是控制黄河的水和泥沙、根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的基本方法。
    当然，依靠手工业的技术不可能在黄河上或它的支流上修建水库和水电站，依靠个体农民的力量也不可能进行大规模的水土保持工作。这里需要现代的科学技术知识，需要国家的大量投资，需要广大群众的支持，需要政府和人民、工人和农民的通力合作。因此，采取这种方法在过去的时代是不可能的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以后，很快就着手研究黄河问题。为了根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利，中华人民共和国水利部（主要是它所领导的黄河水利委员会）、燃料工业部、地质部和其他有关部门在过去几年内进行了大规模的准备工作。历史的记载和近几十年我国水利学者和水利工作人员所积累的大量资料得到了有系统的整理和利用。各有关部门的大批工作人员在整个黄河流域进行了查勘、测量、地质调查、钻探、水文测验和经济调查的巨大工作。他们查勘了黄河干流和支流河道（包括河源）共达一万六千公里，测量了各种地形图八万五千余平方公里，在干流上选择了一百个“比较坝址”，在二十七处坝址上钻了三百四十四个钻孔，并进行了一万一千平方公里的水库经济调查。
    一九五二年，我国向苏联政府聘请专家综合组来我国帮助解决黄河规划的任务。由组长阿·阿·柯洛略夫和其他六位专家组成的这个苏联专家组在
  一九五四年一月到达北京。同年二月，苏联专家、中国专家和有关各部负责人员组成了黄河查勘团，从兰州上游的刘家峡直到黄河海口进行了重点的实地查勘，到六月底回到北京。同年四月，以水利部和燃料工业部为主成立了黄河规划委员会，积极进行关于黄河规划设计文件的编制工作，并在苏联专家组的全力指导帮助之下，在同年十月完成了这一工作。黄河规划委员会所提出的黄河综合利用规划，就是按照上述根治水害、开发水利的方针和方法制定的。国家计划委员会审查了并且同意了这个规划，国务院和中共中央也研究了这个规划。国务院和中共中央认为，这个规划虽然还只是一个轮廓，它的具体工程项目和项目中的许多地点、数字还有待于进一步的研究确定，但是它的原则和基本内容是完全正确的。
    黄河综合利用规划包括远景计划和第一期计划两部分。远景计划的主要内容，首先就是所谓“黄河干流阶梯开发计划”，也就是前面所说的在黄河干流上修建一系列的拦河坝，从而把黄河改造成为
  “梯河”的计划。这一计划拟定由青海贵德上游龙羊峡起，到河南成皋桃花峪止，按照河流的特点，把黄河中游分做四段来分别加以利用。第一段从龙羊峡到甘肃金积县境的青铜峡。这一段河道穿行山岭之间，河身的坡度很陡，水力资源很丰富，而新的工业区域正在迅速发展，所以需要着重利用水力来发电，同时可以利用水库来防洪和灌溉。第二段从青铜峡到内蒙古自治区的河口镇。这一段两岸是山谷间的平原，土壤肥沃，但是缺少雨水，河道开扩，坡度平缓，宜于通航，因此这一段主要的任务是发展灌溉和航运。第三段从河口镇到山西河津的禹门口。这一段黄河进入山西、陕西两岸的峡谷，河道坡度很陡，但因地质条件和地理条件的限制，不能修建大的水坝和水库，只有在上游调节流量的大水库建成以后才能利用水力来发电。第四段从禹门口到桃花峪。这一段从禹门口到陕县两岸是黄土原地，河道开扩；从陕县到孟津是峡谷地带，是控制黄河下游洪水的关键地段，又同山西、河南、陕西的工业区都靠近，因此这一段的主要任务是防洪和发电；从孟津以下基本上是平原，河道平缓，可以设坝灌溉附近的重要农业区。根据初步设计，在上述黄河中游的四个河段准备修建适应于不同条件不同任务的拦河坝四十四座，另外在黄河下游也准备修建用于灌溉的拦河坝两座，共为四十六座。
    根据详细的勘测和周密的研究，黄河干流阶梯开发计划选定在陕县三门峡地方修建一座最大和最重要的防洪、发电、灌溉的综合性工程。三门峡在陕县以东和著名的“中流砥柱”以西，河心有两座石岛把河道隔成所谓“人门”“神门”“鬼门”的“三门”。由于河道窄狭，河底都是坚固的岩石，便于修建大型的水坝。计划中的坝高九十公尺左右，拦阻河水的水位可以高出海面三百五十公尺。被拦阻的河水由陕县上溯到潼关以北临晋和朝邑的黄河两岸，潼关以西临潼以下的渭河两岸和大荔以下的北洛河两岸，形成巨大的水库。它的容积达到三百六十亿公方，仅次于世界最大的古比雪夫水电站的水库，等于我国现有较大的水库丰满水库（一百亿公方）的三·六倍，官厅水库（二十二亿七千万公方）的十六倍。它的面积约为二千三百五十平方公里，比太湖（二千二百多平方公里）还大些。此外，在青海的龙羊峡、积石峡（黄南藏族自治州）和甘肃的刘家峡（永靖）、黑山峡（中卫）也将修建大型的综合性工程。其中刘家峡水库容积可达四十九亿公方。
    为着配合黄河干流的阶梯开发计划，还要在黄河的重要支流修建不少的水库，其中的少数是综合性工程，多数是为着拦蓄支流的泥沙。
    上述的黄河干流支流一系列的水坝修成以后，黄河流域将发生如下的变化：
    第一，黄河洪水的灾害可以完全避免。一座三门峡水库就可以把设想中的黄河最大洪水流量由三万七千秒公方减至八千秒公方，而八千秒公方的流量是可以经过山东境内狭窄的河道安然入海的。万一三门峡和三门峡以下的黄河支流伊河、南洛河、沁河同时发生这种特大的洪水，那么，三门峡水库也可以关闭闸门，把三门峡以上的全部黄河洪水拦蓄四天之久。这样，加上伊河、洛河、沁河三个水库的拦蓄，黄河下游的流量就可以仍然减少到八千秒公方，下游的安全就仍然可以确保。而且由于黄河泥沙已被三门峡大水库和三门峡以上的一系列干流和支流的水库所拦截，下游河水将变为清水，河身将不断刷深，河槽将日趋稳定。因此，现在下游人民的各种防洪负担，将来都可以解除。至于河套以上，在刘家峡水库修成以后，就可以把最大的洪水流量八千三百三十秒公方减至五千秒公方，因而完全避免水灾。
    第二，利用黄河干流上的四十六座拦河坝可以发电二千三百万瓩，每年平均发电量达到一千一百亿度，相当于我国一九五四年全部发电量的十倍。黄河支流上的水库也都可以发电。这将使青海、甘肃、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、河北等地的工业以及交通运输业和现代化的农业得到廉价的电源，使这个广大地区电气化，并将为国家节约大量燃料用煤。
    第三，龙羊峡、刘家峡、黑山峡、三门峡四处大型综合性水利工程都可以用于灌溉，从青铜峡到河口镇一段和桃花峪以下准备修建的拦河坝则将主要用于灌溉。此外，支流上的一部分水库也可以用于灌溉。利用这些工程可以创造稳定的引水条件，避免河水的过分低落和渠水的干枯。在修建了这些水坝、整修和兴修了一系列的渠道和其他灌溉设备以后，灌溉土地的面积可以由现在的一千六百五十万亩扩大到一亿一千六百万亩，占黄河流域需要由黄河灌溉的全部土地面积百分之六十五强。因为黄河的水量不足，其余约百分之三十五土地的灌溉问题，除依靠井水雨水解决一部分外，还需要考虑从汉水或其他邻近水系引水补充黄河水量，才能完全解决。
    第四，在四十六座拦河坝修成并安装过船装置以后，黄河中下游的水量可以按照需要来调节，因此就可以全线通航。五百吨拖船将能由海口航行到兰州。黄河流域的交通运输状况将得到很大的改善。
    在实行上述的阶梯开发计划的时候，必须同时在甘肃、陕西、山西三省和其他黄土区域展开大规模的水土保持工作。这是因为黄河上的水库并不能减轻黄土区域的水土流失，而且相反地，如果不制止这种水土流失，那些水库还有陆续被泥沙淤满、因而丧失防洪能力的危险。计划中的黄河支流上的多数水库的主要任务就是拦蓄泥沙，这当然可以大大减少干流泥沙的来源。但是只有在黄土区域普遍做好水土保持工作，才能从根本上制止泥沙的下泻；否则支流水库本身很快就会淤满，也就无法来延长干流水库的寿命了。
    黄河流域的农民过去也做了一部分水土保持工作。例如在陕西关中、甘肃南部、山西南部和河南西部，梯田有比较广泛的发展。但是直到解放以后，特别是在农业生产合作社发展以后，才在共产党和人民政府的指导之下，在一部分地方开始了有系统的水土保持工作，并收到了显著的效果。甘肃甘谷县牛家坪村由于在一千亩坡地上修了地埂，挖了地坎沟，在道路流水集中处挖了涝池，已经做到水不下坡，泥不出沟。在一九五四年八月一次下七十二公厘的暴雨的时候，那里竟然既没有暴发山洪，也没有损失土壤。该村由于采取了保持水土的措施，每亩小麦产量由一百一十二斤增加到二百八十斤。山西平顺县羊井底村，原是个“少穿没戴，少铺没盖”、“糠菜半年粮”的石山区，一九五○年实行封山育林，一九五三年又在党和政府领导下将所有二万一千六百多亩土地作了总的规划。这一规划规定：全村土地除耕地和村庄河道等占地约六千七百亩外，划分牧坡五千亩，松柏橡树林四千亩，阔叶树一千亩，果树林四千九百多亩。在这一基础上，该村订出了农、林、牧、水（水利）全面结合的十五年发展计划，预计到一九六七年全村每人的收入可折合粮食六千五百四十二斤，等于一九五三年的六倍，其中林业收入占总收入百分之七十九。此外，该村修了一座蓄水池，解决了吃水的困难；把坡地修成梯田七十余亩，每亩由原产一百五十斤增至二百五十斤至三百斤；在沟内修了一百九十八道石“谷坊”（用石在沟中筑成的小坝），能陆续淤地一百五十亩至二百亩，每亩可产粮食二百斤至三百斤；沿沟下游修了四里多长的堤，两岸密植杨柳，固定沟道。过去该村每逢大雨，洪水满沟，三五小时即过，如今雨后清水长流，可达二十五天。这些典型事实，说明黄河中游的水土保持是完全可能的。
    黄河综合利用规划要求，在黄河流域水土流失地区，按照当地具体情况选择采取以下的一系列措施：
        （一）农业技术措施
    1、改良农业耕种技术措施——为了加强土壤吸收雨水能力，实行深耕和雨后中耕；为了加强土壤结构，实行增施肥料和作物轮换；等等。
    2、水土保持耕作法——为了阻止雨水在坡地上向下流泻，实行把作物在横沟中种植、实行横坡耕作和在休闲地上犁“水平沟”，等等。
    3、改良土壤被覆——实行密植，“等高带状间作”（如玉米、高粱和豆类在同一高度的横坡上成带形的间隔种植），种植“缓冲草带”，夏季休闲地种植绿肥，“草田轮作”，栽培牧草，管理放牧，等等。
      （二）农业改良土壤措施
    1、田间工程——坡地修筑梯田，修地边埂和等高沟埂，修田间集水沟和导水沟系统，修“水簸箕”（在坡面水流凹地中逐段修成阶梯状，一段像一个簸箕），等等。
    2、停耕陡坡，改为在陡坡上植树种草。
      （三）森林改良土壤措施
    1、在沟底和沟坡造林，在河岸和河滩造林，在水库岸边造林，在碱地造林。
    2、营造“防风固沙护田林”。
    3、封山育林，坡地和丘陵地造林。
      （四）水利改良土壤措施
    1、在沟头和沟边修筑防止沟壑发展的土埂。
    2、在沟内修筑谷坊、“淤地坝”（在坝内拦泥淤成农田）和大型土坝。
    3、修“水漫地”（将含泥的水流引入围好的滩地，泥淤积后排去清水）。
    4、发展小型灌溉。
    5、修筑拦蓄雨水和泥沙的涝池，修筑储蓄雨水的水窖。
    在这一计划完全实现以后，黄土区域的面貌将大为改变，这一区域的农业生产以及林业牧业生产将大为增加。陕北的农民对这个远景编了一首民歌：“远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山。平川修成米粮川，干沟打坝聚湫滩。坡洼地里种牧草，山腰缓坡修梯田。”他们唱得完全对。但是还有更重要的：从此以后，整个黄河干流和支流的泥沙淤积问题、水库寿命的延长问题，以至整个黄河的洪水问题，都将得到有利的解决。
    由于三门峡水库容量非常大，由于有了黄河支流的拦泥水坝，特别是由于有了黄河中游的水土保持工作，三门峡水库至少可以维持五十到七十年或更长的时间。到了那时，由于其他的一系列措施，黄河水害已经可以大大地减轻。至于三门峡水库淤浅后在发电、灌溉、航运方面发生的困难，都比较容易解决。
    以上是黄河综合利用规划的远景计划的大概。很明显，完全实现这个远景计划需要几十年时间，例如完全实现水土保持的远景计划将需要五十年时间。为了首先解决黄河的防洪、发电、灌溉和其他方面最迫切的问题，黄河规划委员会提出以下的计划作为在三个五年计划期间即一九六七年以前实施的第一期计划。
    第一期计划规定，首先在陕县下游的三门峡和兰州上游的刘家峡修建综合性工程。三门峡工程对于防止黄河下游洪水灾害有决定性的作用，这我已经在前面说过了。三门峡水库的水位比坝下的水位可以高出七十公尺，在那里修建的水电站利用这样高的“水头”可以发电一百万瓩，平均每年发电四十六亿度，可以供给陕西、山西、河南等地相当时期内在工业上和其他方面的需要。三门峡水库在黄河缺水时期可以把下游的最低流量由一百九十七秒公方调节到五百秒公方，以便保证下游河南、河北、山东接近河岸地区的灌溉用水和航运所需要的水量。刘家峡水库虽然比三门峡小得多，它的“水头”却有一百零七公尺高，那里的水电站也可以发电一百万瓩，每年平均发电五十二亿三千万度，可以使甘肃新发展的工业区用电需要得到满足。刘家峡水库可以把河流最小流量由二百秒公方提高到四百六十五秒公方，从而保证了下游原宁夏、绥远省境灌溉和航运的需要。
    河水既然被拦河坝拦蓄起来，形成巨大的水库，通常都不可避免地要淹没一些原有的居民区，因此需要这些地方的居民为着大家的利益，也为着自己的长远利益，迁移到其他地方。刘家峡水库因为面积比较小，那里的人口也比较稀，只要迁移两万七千人。三门峡水库由于需要拦蓄的洪水流量特别大，在拦蓄的水位达到三百五十公尺的时候，就需要淹没耕地二百万亩，迁移居民六十万人。当然，这同黄河泛滥、决口所造成的损失，是完全不能比较的：泛滥、决口要造成生命的损失，财产的损失更无法计算；迁移由于是在人民政府领导和帮助下有计划地进行的，政府保证移民在到达迁移地点以后得到适当的生产条件和生活条件。因此，过去在修造水库或开放蓄洪区、滞洪区的时候，当地的居民都能够服从社会的需要和政府的安置，顺利地完成迁移或临时迁移的计划。但是一次迁移六十万人究竟是有许多困难的。同时在水库开始工作的初期，水位并不需要一下子就抬高到三百五十公尺，而只需要抬高到三百三十五·五公尺。因此，初期只需要迁移二十一万五千人，其余居民，可以根据需要在以后十五年到二十年内陆续迁移。毫无疑问，这些迁移的居民将受到被黄河灾害威胁的八千余万人民的最大的感激，而政府则将努力保证他们在迁移的时候不受损失，并且帮助他们在到达迁移地点后尽快走上安居乐业的道路。
    为了拦阻三门峡以上各支流的泥沙，以保护三门峡的水库，需要在第一期工程中，首先在泾河、葫芦河、北洛河、无定河、延水的适当地方，修建五座水库，并在适当的小支流上，修建五座小型的水库。在第一期工程中，并将在汾河和灞河上修建综合性水库。
    如上所说，三门峡工程因为处在伊河、南洛河、沁河的上游，修成后还不能保证在这三条支流同时发生洪水的时候不造成下游的水灾。因此，在第一期工程中，也将在这些支流上选择一处或几处适当地点修建防洪水库。
    三门峡水库和水电站，拟定在一九五七年开始施工，一九六一年完成。苏联政府已同意担负这一巨大工程的设计。协助我国进行黄河规划的苏联专家组组长柯洛略夫同志，仍将担任这一设计的负责人。
    三门峡下游支流的水库，也拟定在一九六四年以前完成。但是为了防备在这些工程完成以前发生比一九三三年更大的洪水，还必须在下游采取一系列的临时防洪措施。因此，在今后几年内，需要继续加高加固下游的河堤，加强并扩大滞洪区的设施，并继续加强防汛工作。
    第一期计划，在灌溉方面，规定修建青铜峡（甘肃金积）、渡口堂（内蒙古磴口）、桃花峪（河南成皋）三座干流水坝，并相应地在这些地区修建渠道工程。按照第一期计划，将扩大灌溉土地三千零二十五万亩，其中青海二十一万亩，甘肃二百零五万亩，内蒙古四百二十一万亩，陕西二百二十六万亩，山西九十万亩，河南九百六十万亩，河北四百万亩，山东七百零二万亩。同时，将对原有灌溉区一千一百九十八万亩的灌溉状况加以改善。
    第一期计划完成的结果，将使黄河从海口到河南桃花峪七百零三公里的一段，从内蒙古清水河到甘肃银川八百四十三公里的一段，以及在三门峡水库内和刘家峡水库内的两段，可以通航。通航距离约占黄河中下游全长的一半。
    在黄河流域的水土保持工作方面，第一期计划规定、改良耕作面积一亿二千七百万亩，草田轮作牧草面积八百七十万亩，改良天然牧场一亿三千四百六十万亩，培植人工牧场面积六百七十万亩，种植果园二百万亩，停耕陡坡面积一千一百万亩；修梯田二千八百万亩，修带截水沟的梯田一千四百万亩，修地边埂的耕地一千四百七十万亩，修等高沟埂的耕地一千七百万亩，修大型水簸箕三十六万亩；造林二千一百万亩，育苗七十万亩，封山育林三千六百六十万亩；修水窖三万七千个，修涝池二千万公方，修路壕蓄水堰一万六千个，修沟头防护设备二十一万五千个，修谷坊六十三万八千个，修淤地坝七万九千个，实施小型灌溉四百七十六万亩，修水漫地一百万亩，修沟壑土坝三百个，整理沟壑区道路四千三百公里。这也是一个巨大的计划。它需要广大农民积极支持，并且需要政府和农民共同进行大量的投资。实现了这一计划，当地农业生产量将增加一倍，而黄河的泥沙在这一计划和支流拦泥水库修建计划完成以后，则将减少一半左右。
    为了实施黄河综合规划的第一期工程，初步估算需要投资五十三亿二千四百万元。其中：三门峡水库和水电站十二亿二千万元（包括移民费用，下同），刘家峡水库和水电站四亿一千六百万元；输电变电设备五亿元；南洛河、沁河、伊河防洪水库三亿零四百万元，下游临时防洪措施二千七百万元；修建灌溉系统八亿零七百万元，修建灌溉用的三座干流水库二亿八千一百万元，两座综合性的支流水库一亿五千六百万元；保持水土措施七亿三千二百万元，支流拦泥水库六亿七千六百万元；航运设备二亿零五百万元。这是一笔很大的投资。但是这笔投资是完全值得的。第一期计划完成后，仅仅从灌溉方面说，每年就可以增产粮食五十四亿七千万斤，棉花四亿斤，这两项增产的价值，每年达到八亿五千六百万元，十年就是八十五亿六千万元，大大超过了十五年投资的总值。再从发电方面看，三门峡和刘家峡两座水电站每年可发电九十八亿度（初期可发电六十六亿度），且不说这样大的发电量对生产的发展有多大的贡献，只是电的售价本身，如按目前售价约每度六分钱计算，就值五亿八千八百万元，十年的收入也超过了十五年投资的总值。应当指出：三门峡和刘家峡水电站的造价都是特别低廉的。水电站建筑所需要的混凝土量和土石方量，如果分摊在所发的每千度电上来计算，则三门峡每千度电所需要的混凝土为○·三五七公方，土石方为○·四四六公方，刘家峡每千度电所需要的混凝土为○·二三二公方，土石方为○·三二五公方，而古比雪夫水电站每千度电所需要的混凝土为○·八公方，土石方为一五·六公方。如果把三门峡工程投资的三分之一和刘家峡工程投资的二分之一算作发电成本，则三门峡每度电的成本只有三厘三毫，刘家峡每度电的成本只有二厘三毫，而目前我国火力发电的平均成本却是每度三分。很明显，第一期计划的完成，在航运方面也将产生巨大的经济效益。何况第一期计划根本解决了黄河的水灾问题，只是用于防汛的费用就可以省下每年两千万元，由此而避免的人民生命财产的损失和由此而取得的各方面的利益，更是不能用数字来表明的了！
    我国人民从古以来就希望治好黄河和利用黄河。在实行送走水、送走泥沙的治河办法同时，控制水、控制泥沙而加以利用的想法，古时也早有人提出过。例如公元前七年，西汉的贾让就曾向当时的皇帝汉成帝提出了一个没有被采纳的建议，要在现今河南浚县附近的黄河北岸修筑三百余里的石堤，堤下多设水门并修渠，“旱则开东方下水门溉冀州，水则开西方高门分河流”。我国近代的水利学者李仪祉，首先指出了从中游着手治河的必要，并提出过在中游防沙的两种方法：“（一）防止冲刷，以减少其来源。（二）设置谷坊，以堵截其去路。”他们的理想只有到我们今天的时代，人民民主的毛泽东时代，才有可能实现——当然是在高得多的水平上实现。国民党政府在一九四六年请来的美国顾问雷巴德、萨凡奇、葛罗同，在他们所作的“治理黄河初步报告”中，虽然承认水土保持工作的重要，却认为“以之推行于整个区域而生效，需时或将数百年”。这不能不叫人想起周朝的人早就说过的话：“俟河之清，人寿几何！”但是现在我们不需要几百年，只需要几十年，就可以看到水土保持工作在整个黄土区域生效；并且只要六年，在三门峡水库完成以后，就可以看到黄河下游的河水基本上变清。我们在座的各位代表和全国人民，不要多久就可以在黄河下游看到几千年来人民所梦想的这一天——看到“黄河清”！
    各位代表！由以上的说明可以看到，根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，同我们所正在讨论的整个社会主义建设计划的其他项目一样，确是一个伟大的计划，确是我们全国人民值得为它来艰苦奋斗的计划。
    为了实现这一规划，当然首先需要政府各有关部门即水利部、燃料工业部、地质部、重工业部、机械工业部、农业部、林业部、交通部、铁道部、科学院和其他有关方面的共同努力。这一规划的第
  一期计划中，还有许多项目需要作进一步的勘测和研究来确定。已经确定的工程项目需要开始进行设计。由苏联担任设计的三门峡工程，我国的有关部门必须负责供给设计上所需要的资料，并积极进行必要的施工准备工作以及水库区移民的准备工作。为了实现水土保持的第一期的要求，各有关部门应当积极指导地方人民政府定出具体的计划并加以正确的实施。
    但是为了实现这一规划，不仅仅需要政府的努力，还需要全国人民的努力。毫无疑问，全国人民将在人力上、物力上、财力上坚决地支持这一伟大计划的实施。黄河流域各省区的人民，将在这一计划实施的过程中作出最大的贡献。甘肃、陕西、山西三省农民，三省的省、县、乡各级人民委员会，三省的共产党和各民主党派、各人民团体的各级地方组织的工作人员，对于水土保持计划的执行负有最重要的责任。我们相信，他们为了自身的利益、本地方的利益和全国人民的利益，一定能够把他们的责任充分地担负起来。三门峡水库区和其他水库区的居民，本着“一户搬家，保了千家”的美德，也将按照政府的指示实行迁移，积极帮助这一根治和开发黄河的伟大计划的实现。
    黄河规划的拟定，说明我国的水利事业正在迅速前进。中华人民共和国成立以来，在水利方面做了不少的工作，得到很大的成绩，其中如根治淮河和荆江分洪的工程尤其规模巨大。黄河的综合规划，由于对全流域的防灾、发电、灌溉、水土保持和航运各方面都作了通盘的计划，更加显示了河流在整个国民经济的发展中的伟大作用。我们不但要根治和开发黄河，而且要根治和开发长江以及其他重要河流。关于长江的规划将在第一个五年计划期间收集资料，在第二个五年计划期间制定规划并逐步地着手实施。政府在一九五四年十月向苏联政府提出了聘请协助我国进行长江规划的专家综合组的要求，苏联政府已经又一次慷慨地同意了我们的要求。苏联政府决定派十二位专家帮助我们进行长江规划。组长巴·米·德米特立也夫和其他六位专家已经到达中国。苏联在黄河规划、三门峡工程设计和长江规划方面给予我们巨大的援助，请让我在这里代表我国政府和人民向我们伟大的盟邦苏联的政府和人民表示深切的感谢！
    在全国工人、农民、知识分子的一致支持下，在苏联的慷慨援助下，我们一定能够征服黄河，征服长江和其他河流，使它们为我国人民的利益服务，为我国人民的伟大的社会主义事业服务！
    国务院根据中共中央和毛泽东同志的提议，请求全国人民代表大会采纳黄河规划的原则和基本内容，并通过决议要求政府各有关部门和全国人民，特别是黄河流域的人民，一致努力，保证它的第一期工程按计划实现。
