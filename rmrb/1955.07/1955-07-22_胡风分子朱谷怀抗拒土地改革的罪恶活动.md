    Hu Feng Element Zhu Guhuai's Criminal Activities in Resisting Land Reform
    "Southern Daily" reporter
    Not far from Xingning County in Guangdong Province, in the first district of Gutang Township, Gutang Village, stands a fortress-like new house that dwarfs its neighbors. This is the old home of Zhu Guhuai, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. It is a large house with three courtyards, three horizontal buildings, and a surrounding wall, containing more than seventy rooms. Originally called "Hongde Compound," it has now been distributed to twenty-two peasant households and renamed "Farmer's Joy." This change alone made the counter-revolutionary Zhu Guhuai extremely uncomfortable.
    Zhu Guhuai, originally named Zhu Zhenxian, came from a family that engaged in both industry and commerce, as well as landlordism. According to land reform class classification materials, his family owned twenty-one mu and two fen of land in addition to their industrial and commercial activities. Averaging this by the family's population, they possessed more than twice the average land owned by local peasants. Moreover, all of his family's land was either cultivated by hired laborers or rented to poor peasants, engaging in feudal exploitation.
    In the winter of 1948, when our People's Liberation Army was winning victories on all fronts, Zhu Guhuai, "accepting a mission in a time of crisis" from his master Hu Feng, left the Hu Feng group's base in Hangzhou, Anhui Middle School, and returned to his hometown.
    After returning home, he appeared as a "progressive" to deceive the masses. At the same time, he systematically and deliberately arranged for his family to disperse their assets. At that time, his father, Zhu Hongzhen, and his elder brother, Zhu Hancheng, were not satisfied with owning the "Hongde Compound." They were preparing to build another horizontal building, with the foundation already laid and bricks and lumber purchased. However, Zhu Guhuai knew that the Kuomintang reactionaries were doomed, so he persuaded his family to stop construction immediately, saying, "The current situation is not good. The family should make plans early and be kind to people to avoid trouble later." Then, in order for his family to show "kindness" to the peasants, he personally arranged for his family to tell the tenants that they would not collect rent on the land they leased. He also feared that having too many houses would make them a big target, so he plotted to win over the workers in his store and distribute houses to them in order to preserve their property and sow discord between workers and peasants. Zhu Yuzhen, the maid in Zhu Guhuai's household, revealed, "Since Zhu Guhuai returned home, the family's assets have gradually been dispersed, and the landlord family has outwardly become 'kind.'" In order to divide and conquer, on the eve of liberation, Zhu Guhuai's family hired mud workers to build four stoves, and the four Zhu Guhuai brothers carried out a "fake division of property."
    In addition to "advising" his family to disperse assets, houses, and land, Zhu Guhuai himself married the granddaughter of Li Jianhou, a counter-revolutionary local tyrant landlord, in March 1949. The heads of the local reactionary class were invited to attend the wedding, including dozens of Chiang Kai-shek's army commanders and Chiang Kai-shek's Central Statistics Bureau special agents. Zhu Guhuai took this opportunity to win over the surrounding masses, inviting one person from every Zhu surname family in the village, and the entire family if they were close relatives, spending a large amount of money that his family had extracted from the working people. The banquet alone had more than one hundred tables. On the day of the wedding, reactionary armed forces came to maintain order, as if facing a major enemy. Yuan Yinting, the secretary of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang Xingning County Party Committee, praised Zhu Guhuai at the wedding for being "erudite," "talented," and having a "bright future."
    In September 1949, after the third liberation of Xingning County, Zhu Guhuai even more brazenly helped his elder brother Zhu Hancheng disperse the assets in the store. At this time, his elder brother took his concubine and went to Hong Kong to buy goods under the pretext of business, taking with him funds worth twenty-one bales of foreign yarn (each bale of foreign yarn was then worth eight hundred and twelve yuan). By the summer of 1950, Zhu Hancheng returned empty-handed. When people asked him where the money had gone, he claimed that he had lost money in a joint venture smuggling electric boats in Hong Kong. The funds worth twenty-one bales of foreign yarn were cleverly dispersed in this way under Zhu Guhuai's instigation.
    The masses also revealed that during the autumn grain requisition in 1949, Zhu Guhuai used his position as editor-in-chief of the "New Xing Newspaper" to protect his family, clamor for the landlord class, and undermine grain requisition work. At that time, his family was required by the state to pay about fifteen dan of grain as public grain. When Zhu Guhuai found out, he complained everywhere, called, and even personally went to the town district chief to lose his temper, saying that the working comrades were "not thorough," "biased," and "did not understand the situation." He even personally returned home to convene a "elders meeting" (i.e., a meeting of landlords and rich peasants), gathering more than ten landlord class elements such as Zhu Boquan and Zhu Yaozhang to clamor together, forcing district and township workers to reduce the amount of public grain. Not only that, Zhu Guhuai also attempted to transfer the amount of public grain that his family should pay to the poor and lower-middle peasants. He tried his best to distort the facts, mobilizing young students to "investigate and squeeze out hidden grain" from the poor and lower-middle peasants. When some young students did not listen to him, he personally beat gongs to hold meetings, wanting to conduct "investigation and squeezing out hidden grain" among the masses, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. But the insidious counter-revolutionary Zhu Guhuai falsely claimed that this was caused by mistakes made by the district and township governments. In this way, he used sinister means to alienate the relationship between the people's government and the masses. When Zhu Guhuai's family reluctantly handed over ten dan of rice after repeated delays, Zhu Guhuai cursed the district and township workers behind their backs for "violating policies."
    From the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951, peasants in Gutang Township, Xingning County, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carried out a land reform struggle. This aroused Zhu Guhuai's "attachment" and "grief" for his dying landlord class family, even though he had left home long ago. At that time, his elder brother, Zhu Hancheng, copied a form for classifying class components and sent it to him, asking him for advice. After receiving the letter, Zhu Guhuai wrote a letter to the leaders of Xingning County, defending his landlord family. At the same time, he immediately wrote back to his elder brother, telling him to falsely report his class component as industry and commerce, saying that his family had labor and no exploitation in the countryside. Sure enough, when classifying his family's class component, Zhu Hancheng declared himself as industry and commerce and openly took out Zhu Guhuai's letter at the meeting to argue as hard as he could. After the class component was classified, Zhu Guhuai knew that the power of the people could not be insulted. When the attack failed, he immediately ordered a retreat. So he wrote to Zhu Hancheng, telling him to temporarily bow his head to the people, saying that not "feigning death" like this would cause bad consequences. After that, Zhu Guhuai's family became "kind" again. Soon after the end of the land reform in Xingning County, Zhu Guhuai's father, Zhu Hongzhen, used money to bribe the village chief of Gutang Village at the time, and around the Lantern Festival, invited thirteen poor and lower-middle peasant households who were assigned to live in the "Hongde Compound," along with Zhu Guhuai's family, to hold a strange "unity meeting." They said that the land reform was over, the feudal tails were cut off, and the poor and lower-middle peasants and the landlords should be "harmonious" and "peacefully coexist," using this to numb the surrounding peasants' fighting spirit.
    Not long after, Zhu Guhuai's family saw that the storm had passed and began to counterattack the peasants. In the summer of 1951, Zhu Guhuai's mother, Wang Danian, took advantage of the peasants' somewhat lax emotions and frantically counterattacked the peasants, refusing to hand over the dry land that had been distributed to the peasants. She also locked the distributed houses with iron locks, not allowing the peasants to live in them. She openly snatched back a large pot that had been distributed to her maid Zhu Yuzhen. She also forcibly carried away the fertilizer from the toilet that had been distributed to the peasants. At the same time, she dared to hit the peasants' sons and often cursed the peasants: "Short-lived ghosts, exterminators of the race, get you out of here!" This lawless landlord Wang Danian was arrested and sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the People's Government in February 1952, when Gutang Township conducted a review of land reform, at the unanimous request of the peasants. The peasants also struggled against Zhu Hancheng. From these facts, we can see that Zhu Guhuai's family are all "smiling tigers," with kind faces and evil hearts, vicious and cunning landlord class elements. They retreat when they see the situation is not right, and attack when they have the opportunity.
    Because Zhu Guhuai had once wormed his way into the Party, the peasants in Gutang Township had once regarded Zhu Guhuai as a "progressive university student," "revolutionary literary and art worker," and "Communist Party member." Now that his mask has been torn off, the peasants have recognized that Zhu Guhuai was originally a counter-revolutionary element who undermined the socialist revolution. The broad masses of peasants unanimously demanded that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements must be thoroughly purged, their criminal conspiracies exposed, and Zhu Guhuai punished according to law.

    胡风分子朱谷怀抗拒土地改革的罪恶活动
    “南方日报”记者
    离广东省兴宁县城不远的第一区古塘乡古塘村，有一所傲视四邻的堡垒式的新屋，这就是胡风反革命集团骨干分子朱谷怀的老家。这是一座三进三横一围的大屋，里面有七十多间房子。这所大屋原来叫做“宏德围”，现在已经分配给二十二户农民居住，改名为“农家乐”。光是这一变迁，就使反革命分子朱谷怀十分不舒服。
    朱谷怀原名朱振先，他的家庭成份是工商业兼地主。根据土地改革划阶级的材料记载，他家除经营工商业外，还有田二十一亩二分，按他家庭人口平均计算，他们占有的土地已经超过当地农民平均占有土地的两倍以上，而且他家所有的土地都是雇工耕种或出租给贫农，进行封建剥削的。
    一九四八年冬，当我解放大军节节胜利的时候，朱谷怀“临危受命”于他的主子胡风，离开胡风集团在杭州的大本营安徽中学，回到他的家乡。
    他回到家乡后，就以“进步”的面目出现来欺骗群众；同时又有计划有步骤地布置他的家庭分散资财。那时，他的父亲朱宏珍和他的大哥朱汉澄，本来还不以占有“宏德围”为满足的，正在准备再建一所横屋，而且横屋的地基已经打好，砖料、木料等等也都买好了。但是朱谷怀知道国民党反动派的大势已去，便劝说他家立即停工，并对家里说：“现在时局不好，家里要早作打算，对人要和善一点，以免后来麻烦。”接着，他为了要家里向农民表示“和善”，便亲自布置家人对佃户说：他家出租的田地不收租。他又怕家里房屋太多，目标太大，于是又阴谋拉拢他店里的工人，分房子给他们住，以便保存他们的财产，又可挑拨工农的关系。朱谷怀家里的婢女朱玉珍揭发说：“自从朱谷怀回到家里后，家中资财就渐渐分散，地主家庭表面上也变得‘善良’起来了。”为了化整为零，在解放前夕，朱谷怀家又请了泥工建筑炉灶四座，朱谷怀兄弟四人实行“假分家”。
    朱谷怀除了“劝导”家里分散资财、房屋、土地以外，他自己在一九四九年三月间同反革命大恶霸地主李建侯的孙女结了婚。在举行婚礼时，当地反动阶级的头子都被邀请参加，其中有蒋贼军军长、蒋贼中统特务等数十人。朱谷怀乘此机会拉拢周围群众，举凡同乡姓朱的每家都请一人，是亲房的就全家邀请，不惜大量挥霍他家从劳动人民身上剥削来的金钱，仅仅酒席就摆了一百多台。在举行婚礼那天，反动武装前来维护，如临大敌。蒋贼国民党兴宁县党部书记袁荫庭在婚礼上极力夸奖朱谷怀“博学多才”、“有才华”、“前途远大”等等。
    一九四九年九月，兴宁县第三次解放后，朱谷怀更加猖狂地帮助他的大哥朱汉澄疏散店里资财。他的大哥就在这时带了自己的小老婆，托词到香港买货，带去了值二十一件洋纱的资金（每件洋纱现值八百一十二元）。至一九五零年夏天，朱汉澄空身回来了。人们问他钱哪里去了，他推托说在香港同人合伙走电船（走私）亏了本。这值二十一件洋纱的资金就是这样在朱谷怀教唆之下巧妙地被分散了。
    群众还揭露一九四九年秋征的时候，朱谷怀利用“新兴报”总编辑的职位，包庇家庭，为地主阶级叫嚣，破坏征粮工作。当时他家里按国家规定应该缴十五担谷左右的公粮。朱谷怀知道了，就到处叫重，并打电话，甚至亲自找城镇区长发脾气，说工作同志“不深入”、“有偏差”、“不了解情况”。他甚至亲自回家召开“父老会”（即地主、富农会议），纠集朱伯权、朱耀章等十多个地主阶级分子共同叫嚣，强迫区、乡工作人员减少公粮数目。不仅如此，朱谷怀还企图把自己家里应缴公粮数目转嫁到贫雇农身上。他极力歪曲事实，动员青年学生去向贫雇农“查黑挤黑”，一些青年学生并没有听他的话，他就亲自敲锣开会，要在群众中进行“查黑挤黑”，引起群众很大的不满。但是阴险的反革命分子朱谷怀却诬蔑说这是区、乡政府搞错的。他就这样使用阴谋手段，离间人民政府同群众的关系。当朱谷怀家里拖了又拖才无可奈何地交出十担稻谷时，朱谷怀还在背后大骂区、乡工作人员“违反政策”。
    一九五零年冬天到一九五一年春天，兴宁县古塘乡农民在中国共产党领导下进行土地改革斗争。这就引起了已经离家远去的朱谷怀对他那个即将死亡的地主阶级家庭的“留恋”和“悲恸”。那时他的大哥朱汉澄抄了一份划阶级成份的表寄给他，要他作参谋。朱谷怀接到信后，一面写信给兴宁县领导方面，为其地主家庭辩护；一面立即回信给他的大哥，叫他伪报工商业成份，说他家在农村里有劳动没有剥削。果然，在划他家的阶级成份的时候，朱汉澄自报是工商业，并在会场上公开掏出朱谷怀的来信念起来竭力狡辩。划了阶级后，朱谷怀知道人民的力量不可侮，进攻失败了，便立即布置退却。于是便写信给朱汉澄叫他暂时向人民低头，说不这样“装死”一下，就会引起不良恶果。此后，朱谷怀家里再一次“和善”起来了。兴宁县土地改革结束后不久，朱谷怀的父亲朱宏珍使用金钱收买了当时古塘村的村长，在元宵节前后，邀集了分配到“宏德围”住的十三户贫雇农，同朱谷怀家里的人开了一个莫名其妙的“团结会”，说是土地改革结束了，封建尾巴割掉了，贫雇农和地主要彼此“和气”，“和平共处”了，他们以此来麻痹周围农民的斗争情绪。
    过了不久，朱谷怀的家庭见风暴已经过去，就开始向农民反攻了。一九五一年夏天，朱谷怀的母亲王达娘利用农民有些麻痹大意的情绪，便疯狂地向农民反攻倒算，她拒绝把已分给农民的旱地交出来；还把已分的房子用铁锁锁住，不许农民进去居住；她的婢女朱玉珍已分到的一口大锅，她公然强夺回去；已分给农民用的厕所，她也强行把肥料担走；同时竟敢动手打农民的儿子；经常破口骂农民：“短命鬼，绝人种，赶你们出去！”这个不法地主王达娘，在一九五二年二月古塘乡进行土地改革复查的时候，在农民一致要求下，人民政府依法把她逮捕了，判了十五年徒刑。农民并斗争了朱汉澄。从这些事实，我们可以看到朱谷怀一家人都是“笑里藏刀”，面善心恶，毒辣狡猾的地主阶级分子。他们看见来头不对就退却，有机会就进攻。
    由于朱谷怀曾经钻进了党内来，所以古塘乡农民也曾把朱谷怀当成“进步的大学生”、“革命文艺工作者”和“共产党员”。现在他的假面具被剥去了，农民都认清了朱谷怀原来是破坏社会主义革命事业的反革命分子。广大农民一致要求：一定要彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，揭发他们的罪恶阴谋，并依法惩办朱谷怀。
