    Introduction to the Inter-Parliamentary Union
    The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a long-standing international organization of parliamentarians from various countries. This organization was initially established in 1889 by parliamentarians from Britain and France. The Union's charter stipulates that its purpose is "to promote contact between members of parliament from all countries participating in national parliamentary groups, and to unite them in joint action to achieve cooperation between their respective countries, especially through a universal inter-state organization, and to strive to consolidate and develop democratic institutions and for international peace and cooperation between all peoples." The Union also advocates for the peaceful resolution of international disputes through reconciliation and arbitration.
    Members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union are national parliamentary groups composed of all or part of the parliamentarians from various countries. Currently, there are forty-seven national parliamentary groups participating in the Union, including those from the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, the United States, Britain, France, India, Indonesia, Burma, Japan, West Germany, Brazil, Argentina, and others. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided on June 29th of this year to establish a Soviet national parliamentary group to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Subsequently, the Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and Belarus also decided to join the Union.
    The Inter-Parliamentary Union holds an annual conference attended by parliamentary groups from various countries to discuss major international issues and other matters. Resolutions passed by the conference are advisory in nature to the parliaments of various countries. During the recess of the conference, the Union Council is responsible for its work, with each national parliamentary group appointing two representatives to participate in the Council. The current chairman of the Council is Lord Stansgate, a member of the British House of Lords. The Union's headquarters are located in Geneva.
    The administrative body of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee exercises the powers conferred on the Council by the charter, and is composed of seven members belonging to different parliamentary groups, with the Chairman of the Council serving as its ex officio member and chairman.
    The Union Council meeting held in Rome in mid-April of this year adopted the agenda for the 44th conference to be held in Helsinki from August 25th to 31st of this year. The agenda includes issues such as peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems, international security and disarmament, development of international economic and cultural ties, and strengthening the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

    各国议会联盟介绍
    各国议会联盟是一个历史悠久的各国议会议员之间的国际组织。这个组织最初是由英国和法国的议员发起在一八八九年成立的。联盟章程中规定联盟的宗旨是，“促进一切国家中参加全国议员团的议员之间的接触，并联合他们共同行动以取得各该国间的合作，特别是通过一个具有普遍性的国家间的组织来取得这种合作，并为巩固和发展民主制度以及为国际和平和各国人民间的合作而努力。”联盟并且主张：通过和解仲裁的方式来和平解决国际争端。
    各国议会联盟的会员是各国全部或一部分议员组成的全国议员团。现在共有四十七国议员团参加了联盟，其中有苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、美国、英国、法国、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、日本、西德、巴西、阿根廷等国的议员团。苏联最高苏维埃代表是在今年六月二十九日决定成立苏联全国议员团，参加各国议会联盟。其后，乌克兰和白俄罗斯最高苏维埃代表也分别决定参加联盟。
    各国议会联盟每年召开一次代表大会，各国议员团参加，讨论重大的国际问题及其他问题，代表大会通过的决议对各国议会是建议性质。在代表大会休会期间，由联盟理事会负责工作，理事会由各国议员团指派两个代表参加。现任理事会主席是英国上院议员斯坦斯盖特。联盟总部设在日内瓦。
    各国议会联盟的行政机关是执行委员会。执行委员会行使理事会依照会章所赋予的职权，由属于不同议员团的七名委员组成，理事会主席是它的当然委员和主席。
    今年四月中旬在罗马举行的联盟理事会会议，通过了今年八月二十五日至三十一日在赫尔辛基举行第四十四届代表大会的议程，议程中包括政治和社会制度不同的国家间和平共处、国际安全和裁军、发展国际经济及文化联系、加强各国议会联盟等问题。（新华社）
