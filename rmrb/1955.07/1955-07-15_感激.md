    Gratitude
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    When working on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, people are often treated with warmth and gratitude by the herdsmen. Of course, they do this for their own reasons.
    Once, when a comrade from the Inner Mongolia Daily and I were interviewing in the Chen Barag Banner, we got lost in the large grassland of the Hatton Huoshuo Baga (village). We dismounted and went into a nearby Mongolian yurt, hoping to ask someone how to get to the "Bagada" (village head). After we went inside, the hostess put down her work, busy preparing tea, insisting that we drink some hot tea to warm up before leaving.
    While we were talking, the host also returned from outside. He heard that I was from the capital of the motherland. A childlike, innocent joy spread across the middle-aged man’s face. He shook my hand and said: "My name is Banghe. When you return to Beijing, please give our Chairman Mao a message: Thank the Communist Party, thank Chairman Mao, I have good eyes now!" He showed the herdsman's characteristic straightforwardness and simplicity, but his sudden statement left me puzzled.
    "What's the matter with your eyes?" I asked him.
    "You don't know," he said, "a year ago, I was a useless person!" He pulled my hand and sat down with me, telling me about the incident.
    His eyes had been failing him for eight years. At that time, it was shortly after liberation, and it was difficult to find a doctor on the grasslands. He asked lamas to chant scriptures everywhere and sought witch doctors to perform rituals, spending ten large cows, but his illness did not improve at all. Later, he became discouraged, believing that his eyes were beyond saving. What could a herdsman do without his eyes? He stayed in the Mongolian yurt all day, unable to see the beautiful grasslands and his own livestock.
    Although Banghe couldn't do any work, thanks to the hard work of his wife, Xilaweihen, and his brother, his family's life had been getting better year by year since liberation. In recent years, they had also joined mutual aid teams, working together lively and studying culture together, everyone thinking about living a better life in socialism.
    But the faster life moved forward, the more anxious Banghe became. He thought: Staying like this all day, like a dead man, what hope is there! When he thought of despair, he hated himself: Living like this is worse than dying!
    In June 1954, the People's Government sent a VD control team to the grasslands to treat the herdsmen. After examination, the doctor said he had a venereal disease, and according to his medical history, his blindness might also be caused by venereal disease. At the time, he was skeptical of the doctor's words, but now that the doctor had come to his door, and treatment was free, how could there have been such a good thing in the past? Adding to the persuasion of his wife, Xilaweihen, he decided to go to the VD control station for treatment.
    The VD control station was only a few miles from where he lived. Riding his horse, relying on the faint light that penetrated his eyes to find his way, he went to the VD control station every day for injections.
    He remembered clearly that it was the fourteenth day he went to the VD control station: In the past, he always had to cross a dirt hill, then walk a while, to a puddle, only a few dozen steps away from the VD control station, before he could vaguely see the Mongolian yurt of the VD control station. But that day, as soon as he crossed the hill, he saw the Mongolian yurt from afar. At that time, he didn't dare to believe his eyes, but when he walked not far, before reaching the puddle, he could clearly see the vehicles and horses parked next to the VD control station.
    Arriving at the VD control station, he hugged the doctor with both hands, tears of gratitude streaming down his face. He couldn't say much, only shouting: "My eyes are healed! My eyes are healed!"
    After receiving treatment at the VD control station, he galloped back. He saw his wife picking cow dung near the Mongolian yurt from afar and shouted on horseback: "Xilaweihen, I can see you now!"
    Xilaweihen dropped her dung basket and ran towards him. She saw Banghe riding on the horse looking at her so happily (since Banghe's eyes went blind, she hadn't seen him so happy in these years!). She believed that Banghe's eyes had light and emotion. But she still wanted to test Banghe's eyesight. Xilaweihen ran to the side, held out a hand and said: "Look! How many fingers am I holding up?"
    "Come closer, the doctor said my eyes haven't fully recovered, and they will be completely healed after another period of treatment."
    Xilaweihen held out her hand and walked forward.
    Banghe shouted: "It's four!" He was right.
    Xilaweihen ran over and helped Banghe off the horse. His Mongolian yurt was suddenly crowded with people, men and women from the mutual aid team came to congratulate him.
    Half a month later, Banghe's eyes were completely healed. He immediately joined the mutual aid team's herding work, riding his own horse again and galloping on the grassland. He felt like he had been reborn, and everything was fresh.
    In the winter of 1954, he joined the literacy class in the people's school to learn culture, taught by Chagan Naohai, the leader of the mutual aid team, every day. In one winter, he took the time to learn nineteen lessons of the literacy course. As he spoke, he took out his exercise book to show me, which was densely filled with Mongolian letters.
    "I am only forty-two years old this year," he said, "as long as I study hard, I will be able to read newspapers in two or three years. Everyone is rushing to build socialism, and I can't be illiterate anymore!"
    We drank the fragrant milk tea that the hostess had prepared and said goodbye to them. As we left, the couple said in unison: "Someday, we want to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!"

    感激
    本报记者  林沫
    在内蒙古草原上工作的时候，人们经常会受到牧民热情的款待和感激。他们这样作，当然各有各的原因。
    有一次，当我同内蒙古日报的一个同志到陈巴尔虎旗采访的时候，在哈顿胡硕巴嘎（村）的大草滩里迷了路。我们下马走进附近的一个蒙古包里，想找人问问，到“巴嘎达”（村长）那里该怎么走。我们进去之后，女主人说着话，就把手里的活计放下，忙着去烧茶，一定要我们喝点热茶暖和下再走。
    说话之间，这家的男主人也从外边回来了。他听说我是从祖国的首都来的，在这个中年人的脸上流露出一种孩子似的天真的喜悦，他握着我的手说：“我叫邦合，你回到北京给咱毛主席捎句话：感谢共产党，感谢毛主席，我有了好的眼睛！”他表现了牧民特有的直率和单纯，但他突然这么说，却使我摸不清事情的来由。
    “怎么回事呢，你的眼睛？”我问他。
    “你不知道呵，”他说，“一年前我还是个不中用的人哩！”他拉着我的手一起坐下来，向我讲述了这件事。
    八年以前他的眼睛就不中用了。那时刚解放不久，草原上还很难找到医生，他到处请喇嘛念经，找巫医跳神，花了十头大牛，病一点也不见好，以后他就灰心泄气，认为自己的眼睛没有救了。一个牧民失掉了眼睛还能干么呢？他整天呆在蒙古包里，再也看不到美好的草原和自己的畜群了。
    邦合虽然不能干什么活了，但有他妻子西拉薇痕和他哥哥的辛勤劳动，解放后他家的生活却一年比一年好起来了。这几年，他们也参加了互助组，大家热热闹闹地干活，还在一起学习文化，人人都想到社会主义过更好的生活。
      但生活前进的越快，邦合心里却越着急，他想：这样一天呆着，活像个死人样，有什么盼头呢！想到绝望的时候，他就恨自己：这样活着，还不如死了好！
      一九五四年六月，人民政府派来了驱梅队到草地给牧民治病。经过检查，医生说他有性病，而且根据病历判断，他的眼睛失明也可能是由于性病引起的。对医生的话，当时他心里半信半疑，但如今医生送上门来，治病又不花钱，过去那有这样好的事呢？再加他妻子西拉薇痕的劝说，他就决定到驱梅站去治疗。
  驱梅站离他住的地方只有几里地，他骑着马，靠着模模糊糊透进眼帘的一点亮光思寻着道路，每天到驱梅站去打针。
    他记得很清楚，那是第十四天到驱梅站去：往日他总是翻过一道土岗子，再往前走一阵，到一个水泡子旁边，离驱梅站只有几十步远的时候，他才能恍恍惚惚地看到驱梅站的蒙古包。但这天当他刚翻过那道岗子，就远远望见了那蒙古包。这时他还有点不敢相信自己的眼睛，但当他再往前走没多远，还没到水泡子那里，却已清楚看到停在驱梅站旁边的车马了。
    到驱梅站，他双手抱着医生，眼里流着感激的热泪，一时说不出更多的话来，只是喊着：“我的眼睛好了！我的眼睛好了！”
    他在驱梅站治疗之后，就飞马往回跑。他远远看见妻子在蒙古包旁边捡牛粪，就骑在马上喊着：“西拉薇痕，我现在能看见你了！”
    西拉薇痕丢下粪筐向他跑过来，她见邦合骑在马上那么欢心地望着她，（自从邦合的两眼失明以后，这些年来她就没看见他这么高兴过呵！）她就相信邦合的眼里有了光明和感情。但她还是要试试邦合的眼力，西拉薇痕跑过一边去，迎面伸出一只手说：“看呀！我的手伸出几个手指？”
    “你再走近些，医生说我的眼睛还没有复原，再治疗一个时期就会完全好的。”
    西拉薇痕伸着手往前走。
    邦合喊着：“是四个！”他说对了。
    西拉薇痕跑过去，把邦合接下马来。他的蒙古包里一下挤满了人，互助组的男男女女都来向他道贺。
    半个月之后，邦合的眼睛完全好了。他立即参加了互助组的放牧工作，重新骑上自己的马奔驰在草原上。他像死后重生一样，感到一草一木都是新鲜的。
    一九五四年冬天，他就参加民校识字班学习文化，每天由互助组组长查干脑海来教他。一个冬天，他就抽空把扫盲课学了十九课。说着，他拿出自己的练习本给我看，上面密密麻麻地写满了蒙文字母。
    “我今年才四十二岁，”他说，“只要好好学习，两三年就能看报了。大家都赶着建设社会主义，我可不能再当文盲呵！”
    我们喝了女主人给煮的浓香的奶茶，向他们告别了。临走时，他们夫妇齐声说：“什么时候，我们要到北京去看毛主席呀！”
