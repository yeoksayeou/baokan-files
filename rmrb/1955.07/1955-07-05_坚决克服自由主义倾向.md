　　Resolutely Overcome Liberalistic Tendencies
　　Xǔ Bāngyí
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident makes us see more clearly that: Liberalism is a dangerous tendency. Liberalistic tendencies actually play a role in aiding the enemy. People with liberalistic tendencies can sleep with tigers, and can also serve tigers. Counter-revolutionaries can regard people with liberalistic tendencies as good friends. For example, Hu Feng elements stole confidential documents and inquired about the Party's situation from some people in our Party with liberalistic tendencies; and Hu Feng elements also selected those with liberalistic tendencies, those dissatisfied with the Party, and those who had lost their vigilance as "targets" to be won over.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident shows that serious liberalistic tendencies do exist among some comrades in our Party. This liberalistic tendency has gradually corrupted some comrades politically, to the point where they cannot distinguish between enemies and friends. Because of the existence of this liberalistic tendency, the activities of Hu Feng elements and all counter-revolutionary elements are facilitated. Hu Feng elements and other counter-revolutionary elements, under the cover of people with liberalistic tendencies, can establish a foothold, and can "contact people" and "win over people."
    We have some such Communist Party members who often talk about being infinitely loyal to the Party, but in reality, they turn a blind eye to activities that endanger the Party, and they calmly accept incorrect words and deeds. Some people have witnessed bad people and bad things, but it does not arouse any righteous indignation, and they even echo some fallacies that are detrimental to the Party, or intentionally or unintentionally defend bad people and bad things. Some people often abandon Party principles in order to achieve certain ulterior personal motives. They neither offend Zhang San nor offend Li Si; their wish is to turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems. In their view, it is better to do less than to do more. Some people don't care about anything, as long as the sky doesn't fall. They are intoxicated by the victories they have already achieved. Some people only care about their work and don't ask about politics. Apart from their own professional work, any major political events that occur inside and outside the Party are considered "none of my business." There are also such people who regard "worldliness" as sophistication, and regard adhering to Party principles as "naiveté." Is it not a fact that at present, some comrades in our Party are gradually losing their revolutionary enthusiasm, becoming numb and apathetic, and lacking in fighting spirit due to the growth of liberalism? People with liberalistic tendencies are bound to lose their political vigilance. They can irresponsibly talk nonsense, arbitrarily conduct "small broadcasts," and leak Party and state secrets; when they are criticized or punished by the Party, they can go everywhere to find "warmth" and find people who sympathize with them; they can regard the enemy as a "confidant," and can also adopt a tolerant and indifferent attitude towards the enemy. And nothing is more dangerous to the cause of the Party than losing political vigilance.
    Communist Party members must be loyal to the Party. However, loyalty to the Party is not abstract, not verbal, but must be specifically manifested. Loyalty to the Party means having full revolutionary enthusiasm, having a high degree of initiative and responsibility; it means adhering to Party principles, and taking the interests of the Party and the people as the highest criterion for one's words and actions. If a Communist Party member does not actively participate in political life, does not expose bad people and bad things, does not fight against bad elements and all phenomena that harm the interests of the Party and the people, but adopts a liberalistic attitude of compromise, muddling along, and perfunctorily, this is a manifestation of disloyalty to the Party, which is incompatible with the identity of a Communist Party member. The Party cannot allow passive people, people who do not care about the interests of the Party and the people, and people who attempt to live in peace with the enemy in its ranks. As a Communist Party member, there is absolutely no right to say, "This matter has nothing to do with me," in the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements. It is the duty of a Communist Party member to fight against all bad people and bad things inside and outside the Party, and against all phenomena inside and outside the Party that harm the interests of the Party. Conscientiously fulfilling the obligations of a Party member is the main sign of a Communist Party member's loyalty to the Party.
    Liberalism is a corrosive, it is fundamentally opposed to Marxism. Liberalism wants people to lay down their weapons of struggle, it wants to make people live in a state of paralysis. The enemies of the Party most welcome the retention of liberalistic tendencies in our Party ranks, and our Party has consistently and resolutely opposed this bad tendency. As early as eighteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote a special thesis "Combat Liberalism." In this thesis, he made an in-depth Marxist analysis and critique of the various manifestations of liberalism, the harm of liberalism to the Party and the revolution, and its root causes, and called on every Communist Party member to overcome liberalistic tendencies. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "We must use the positive spirit of Marxism to overcome negative liberalism. A Communist Party member should be open-minded, honest, active, take the interests of the revolution as his first life, subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests; adhere to correct principles at all times and in all places, wage tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and behaviors, in order to consolidate the collective life of the Party, consolidate the Party's ties with the masses; care more about the Party and the masses than about himself, care more about others than about himself. Only in this way can one be considered a Communist Party member." In fact, liberalistic tendencies have caused significant damage to the cause of our Party. If we do not pay attention to overcoming this tendency, our Party cannot be consolidated and developed. In the history of our Party and in our daily practical work, there have been many painful lessons. However, some of our comrades have not deeply learned from these lessons. This Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident has issued us a sharp warning: Now is the time to resolutely overcome liberalistic tendencies.

### 坚决克服自由主义倾向

　　坚决克服自由主义倾向
　　许邦仪
    胡风反革命集团事件使我们更加清楚地看出：自由主义是一种危险的倾向。自由主义倾向实际上是起着援助敌人的作用。有自由主义倾向的人，可以和老虎睡在一起，也可以为老虎服务。有自由主义倾向的人，反革命分子就可以把他看成是好朋友。譬如说，胡风分子就曾从我们党内一些有自由主义倾向的人中间偷窃机密文件，探听到党内的情况；并且胡风分子也曾把那些有自由主义倾向的人，对党不满的人，丧失警惕性的人选作为可“争取”的对象。
    胡风反革命集团事件说明了在我们党内某些同志中间，确实是存在着严重的自由主义倾向。这种自由主义倾向已经使得某些同志在政治上逐渐腐化起来，以致辨别不清敌人和朋友。由于这种自由主义倾向的存在，就便利了胡风分子以及一切反革命分子的活动。胡风分子以及其他反革命分子在有自由主义倾向的人的掩护下，就可以存身立足，就可以“联络人”和“争取人”。
    我们有一些这样的共产党员，他们时常在嘴里讲对党无限忠诚，而实际上对于危害党的活动却熟视无睹，对于不正确的言论和行为却泰然处之。有人亲眼看到了一些坏人坏事，丝毫引不起义愤，甚至随声附和一些对党不利的谬论，或者有意无意地为坏人坏事作辩护。有人往往为了达到个人的某些不可告人的目的，可以放弃党的原则。他们是既不得罪张三，又不得罪李四；他们的愿望是：大事化小，小事化了。在他们看来，多一事不如少一事。有人是万事都不在乎，只要天塌不下来。他们为已经取得的胜利所陶醉。有人是只顾业务，不问政治，除了他们本行业务以外，党内党外所发生的任何重大政治事件都认为“与我无关”。也有这样的人，他们把“世故”看成是老练，把坚持党的原则看成是“幼稚”。目前在我们党内有某些同志由于自由主义的滋长，以致逐渐失掉革命热情，麻木不仁，战斗的劲头不足，这难道不是事实吗？有自由主义倾向的人，必然会丧失政治警惕性。他可以不负责任地随便乱说，随意进行“小广播”，泄露党和国家的机密；他可以在受到党的批评或处分时，到处去找“温暖”，找同情自己的人；他可以把敌人看做是“知己”，也可以对敌人采取宽容和漠不关心的态度。而对于党的事业最危险不过的就是丧失政治警惕。
    共产党员必须对党忠诚。可是，对党忠诚，不是抽象的，不是口头上的，而是要具体地表现出来。对党忠诚，这就是要有充分的革命热情，要有高度的积极性和责任感；这就是要坚持党的原则，要以党和人民的利益作为自己言论和行动的最高准则。如果一个共产党员不积极地参加政治生活，不去揭露坏人坏事，不去同坏分子以及一切损害党和人民利益的现象进行斗争，而采取调和折中、得过且过、敷衍了事的自由主义态度，这就是对党不忠诚的表现，这是同共产党员的身份不能相容的。党不能容许在自己的队伍中有消极的人，有不关心党和人民利益的人，有企图同敌人和平相处的人。对反革命分子的斗争，作为一个共产党员，更绝对没有权利说：“这件事和我没有关系。”同党内党外的一切坏人坏事，同党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象进行斗争，这是共产党员的义务。切实履行党员的义务，这是共产党员对党忠诚的主要标志。
    自由主义是一种腐蚀剂，它是同马克思主义根本对立的。自由主义是要人们放下战斗的武器，是要使人们在麻痹状态中生活。党的敌人最欢迎我们党的队伍中保留自由主义倾向，而我们党是一贯地、坚决地反对这种恶劣的倾向。早在十八年前，毛泽东同志就曾专门写了一篇“反对自由主义”的论文。他在这篇论文中，对于自由主义的各种表现、自由主义对党对革命的危害性和它的产生根源，都作了深入的马克思主义的分析和批判，并号召每个共产党员克服自由主义倾向。毛泽东同志指示说：“我们要用马克思主义的积极精神，克服消极的自由主义。一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”事实上自由主义倾向曾经给我们党的事业以重大的损害，如果不注意克服这种倾向，我们党就不能巩固和发展。在我们党的历史上以及我们日常的实际工作中，曾有过不少痛苦的教训。可是，我们有一些同志并没有深刻地吸取教训。这次胡风反革命集团事件向我们尖锐地提出了警告：现在应当是坚决克服自由主义倾向的时候了。
