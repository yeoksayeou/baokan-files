　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 1st: The Warsaw Provincial Court of Poland sentenced A. Yaroszewicz, an anti-state conspirator who infiltrated state organs, seized important positions, and engaged in subversive activities, to twelve years in prison on June 30th.

　　Yaroszewicz was a special agent of the Second Division (Intelligence Division) of the pre-war Polish General Staff. From 1940 to 1944, he also served as a special agent of the German Secret Police, responsible for collecting intelligence on the activities of the Polish anti-fascist movement. After the Soviet army liberated Poland, the defendant Yaroszewicz and other special agents of the Second Division of the General Staff, with the help of former Deputy Minister of National Defense Spychalski, seized important positions in state organs. He was appointed as the director of a department of the Ministry of Supply, and later as a deputy minister. Special agent Lechowich of the Second Division of the General Staff was appointed as the Minister of Supply. They carried out subversive activities within Polish state organs, doing everything possible to undermine the people's regime and the people's state.

　　But their evil activities were finally exposed, and the conspirators received their due punishment.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 1st: Czechoslovakia recently cracked down on an anti-state conspiracy organization case. The case has been handed over to the Trial Committee of the Military Court of the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia for trial.

　　Twelve people have been arrested from the uncovered conspiracy organization, and its leader is Niemczyk. Niemczyk and his accomplices united elements who planned to restore the fascist regime and all kinds of counter-revolutionaries to form a criminal "People's" Party. These conspirators received instructions from Slovak traitors living abroad to carry out activities to subvert the people's democratic regime. In order to carry out these criminal activities, they established leadership centers and collected weapons. They agreed to establish some underground counter-revolutionary teams in Slovakia, so that once the imperialist army attacked Czechoslovakia, they would rise up against the people. They had begun to establish a special bandit detachment, preparing to assassinate Slovak party, state, and social activists.

　　But their conspiracy failed to achieve their desires in the face of the powerful people's forces, and they themselves could not escape the sanctions of the people's law.

　　The interrogation is still in progress.

　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Berlin, June 26th, TASS: The Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic concluded the trial of five special agents of the West Berlin espionage and sabotage center—RIAS Radio—on June 25th, sentencing Webach to death, Klaus to life imprisonment, and sentencing Beer, Gast, and Vogt to eight to fifteen years in prison respectively.

　　According to the German News Agency: The trials of two other espionage and sabotage cases have also ended. The Frankfurt District Court has sentenced five special agents of the Gehlen espionage organization to eight to fifteen years in prison respectively. The Karl Marx Stadt District Court also sentenced a group of spies headed by Ingermann.

　　波、捷、民主德国破获反国家阴谋组织
    新华社华沙一日电　波兰华沙省法院六月三十日判处了混入国家机关、窃取重要职位、进行颠覆活动的反国家阴谋分子阿·雅罗谢维奇十二年徒刑。
    雅罗谢维奇是战前波兰参谋总部第二处（情报处）的特务，他在一九四○年到一九四四年期间，还充当德国秘密警察的特务，负责收集关于波兰反法西斯运动的活动的情报。在苏军解放波兰之后，被告雅罗谢维奇和参谋总部第二处的其他特务，在前国防部副部长斯彼哈尔斯基的帮助下，窃取了国家机关的重要职务。他曾被任命为供应部某处处长，后来又被任命为副部长。参谋总部第二处特务列霍维奇被任命为供应部部长。他们在波兰国家机关内进行颠覆活动，千方百计地破坏人民的政权和人民的国家。
    但是他们的罪恶活动终于被揭露了，阴谋分子受到了应有的惩处。
    新华社布拉格一日电　捷克斯洛伐克最近破获了一件反国家阴谋组织案。这个案件已交由捷克斯洛伐克最高法院军事法庭审判委员会审理。
    已破获的阴谋组织有十二人被捕，它的首领是涅姆契克。涅姆契克和他的同谋者把策划复辟法西斯政权的分子和形形色色的反革命分子联合组成一个罪恶的“人民”党。这些阴谋分子从住在外国的斯洛伐克叛国分子那里获得指令，来进行颠覆人民民主政权的活动。为了进行这种犯罪活动，他们建立了领导中心并且搜集了武器。他们商妥要在斯洛伐克建立一些地下的反革命队伍，以便在帝国主义军队一旦袭击捷克斯洛伐克时，起来反对人民。他们已开始建立一支特别的匪帮支队，准备刺杀斯洛伐克的党、国家和社会的活动家。
    但是他们的阴谋在强大的人民力量面前并没有能够如愿以偿，他们本人也逃不了人民法律的制裁。
    审讯还在继续进行。
    新华社讯　据塔斯社柏林六月二十六日讯：德意志民主共和国最高法院六月二十五日结束了对西柏林间谍和破坏中心——里亚斯电台——的五个特务分子的审讯，判处韦巴赫死刑，克劳斯无期徒刑，分别判处贝尔、加斯特和沃格特以八年到十五年的徒刑。
    据德意志通讯社报道：对其他两件间谍和破坏分子的案件的审讯也已结束。法兰克福地方法院已分别判处盖伦间谍组织的五个特务分子以八年到十五年的徒刑。卡尔·马克思斯塔特地方法院也对以英盖尔曼为首的一批间谍作了判决。
