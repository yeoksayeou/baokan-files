Seize the Rapeseed Unified Purchase Work
　　Liulin

At present, it is the season when rapeseed is on the market in large quantities, and the unified purchase of rapeseed is underway. The time for rapeseed to be on the market is generally relatively short. After the farmers thresh the rapeseed, winnow it, and dry it in the sun, they take it to the market for sale, and most of them sell it all at once in order to buy topdressing fertilizer and fertilizer needed for autumn crops, or to buy some seasonal household items.

Judging from the current situation, the rapeseed unified purchase plans in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces have been completed well; the work in Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Zhejiang provinces is progressing slowly. Why are the rapeseed unified purchase plans completed well in some areas and poorly in others? There are of course many reasons, but it is greatly related to whether the methods and regulations for implementing the unified purchase policy are appropriate and specific. Sichuan Province clearly stipulates the amount of rapeseed retained by farmers for their own use, and at the same time announces that the government only purchases 85% to 90% of the surplus, so that farmers have a clear idea; for farmers who voluntarily sell all their rapeseed, the government guarantees to supply edible oil according to the original standard for self-use edible oil. In order to encourage farmers to actively sell rapeseed, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also signed combined "selling seeds and supplying cake" contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, supplying oil cake to sellers at a ratio of 40% to 60% of the amount of oil cake that can be produced from the sold rapeseed. These measures have been supported by farmers, so the unified purchase work is progressing smoothly. Jiangsu, Anhui and other places have not made specific regulations on the amount of edible oil retained by farmers, and farmers have no clear idea, resulting in reluctance to sell. These areas should quickly take effective measures to eliminate this idea of farmers and ensure the completion of the rapeseed unified purchase task.

In addition, in some areas, because the preparatory work for the unified purchase of rapeseed was done very poorly, there have been many phenomena of farmers queuing up to sell. A small number of purchasing departments took the opportunity to suppress grades and prices, arousing dissatisfaction among farmers, resulting in a sharp decline in the amount of rapeseed on the market. The party committees and governments in these areas must quickly correct the deviations in the implementation of policies by the purchasing departments and urge them to do a good job in the unified purchase of rapeseed.

In the unified purchase of rapeseed, the purchasing departments in various places must handle the purchased rapeseed in a timely manner. The purchased rapeseed should be delivered to processing units for oil extraction in a timely manner; otherwise, after the dog days, its oil yield will decrease. At the same time, the rapeseed that should be re-dried should be exposed to the sun in time to avoid the rapeseed from heating up and rotting due to excessive moisture.

### 抓紧菜籽统购工作

　　抓紧菜籽统购工作
　　柳林
    目前正是菜籽大量上市的季节，菜籽统购工作正在进行。菜籽上市时间一般是比较短促的。农民打下菜籽扬净晒干后，就拿到市场上出售，而且大都是一次售完，以便购买追肥和大秋作物所需的肥料，或者购买一些换季的生活用品。
    从目前情况看，四川、云南、江西等省的菜籽统购计划完成得较好；江苏、贵州、浙江等省的这项工作进展较慢。为什么菜籽统购计划有的地区完成得好有的地区完成得差呢？原因当然很多，但同贯彻统购政策的办法规定得是否恰当、具体，是有很大关系的。四川省明确规定农民留下的自用菜籽数量，同时宣布，政府只统购余量的百分之八十五至九十，使农民心里有底；对自愿全部出售菜籽的农户，则保证按原定的自用食油的标准供应食油。为了鼓励农民积极出售菜籽，各地供销合作社还同农业生产合作社和互助组订立“售籽供枯”的结合合同，按出售菜籽可产油枯数量的百分之四十至六十的比例供应出售户油枯。这些办法得到了农民的拥护，因此统购工作进展顺利。江苏、安徽等地对农民自留食用油量未作具体规定，农民心里没底，产生了惜售思想。这些地区应迅速采取有效措施，消除农民的这种思想，保证菜籽统购任务的完成。
    另外，有些地区，由于菜籽统购的准备工作做得很差，发生了许多农民排队求售的现象。少数收购部门竟趁机压级压价，引起了农民的不满，结果菜籽上市量突然锐减。这些地区的党委和政府必须迅速纠正收购部门执行政策中的偏差，督促它们做好菜籽统购工作。
    在菜籽统购工作中，各地收购部门对收进的菜籽必须及时处理。收进的菜籽应及时交加工单位榨油；否则，过了伏天，它的出油率就会降低。同时，对该复晒的菜籽就要及时曝晒，以免菜籽因水份过多而发热霉烂。
