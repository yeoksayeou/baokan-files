    Improving Pull-Fuse Detonators to Eliminate Personal Accidents
    To the Editor:
    I am a worker participating in the railway construction of Northwest China. I have been working on the Baoji-Tianshui Railway since 1951.
    In the Northwest railway construction project, we have to fight against steep cliffs and rocks every day. A moment of carelessness can cause casualties. Therefore, safe production has become a major issue in our project. Under the leadership of the Party, we have successfully solved this problem.
    In order to save materials, Liu Jingxia, a worker in the 17th Engineering Area, created a "moving rope pull-fuse bottom-combustion explosion method." This method saves a lot of materials and improves work efficiency compared to the iron detonator and fuse blasting method. However, when this method was fully promoted in the Second Engineering Section, three major personal accidents occurred one after another, affecting many engineering areas that dared not use this method. I witnessed worker Chen Decai's hands and face being injured in a pull-fuse blasting accident, and I felt unspeakable sadness in my heart. I thought, I am a Communist Party member and the secretary of the Youth League branch. The Party has repeatedly called on us to do a good job in safe production. How can I watch my worker brothers get injured? I also remembered the deeds of Zhang Mingshan, who created the anti-encirclement plate to eliminate personal accidents. Therefore, I decided to improve the pull-fuse detonator and eliminate personal accidents in pull-fuse blasting.
    After countless studies, I found the cause of the accidents. The problem with pull-fuse blasting lies in the installation of the earthen detonator. The earthen detonator is buried in the blast hole, and the pull-fuse lead wire runs directly from the bottom of the bamboo tube to the outside. When workers load the explosives and dig the blast hole, they can easily touch the pull-fuse wire, causing an explosion. If the detonator is placed on top of the bamboo tube and loaded with gunpowder, accidents can be avoided. After discussing my ideas with the masses, I used rest time and rainy day shutdowns to conduct experiments. However, the experiments failed several times. The first time, I set off six blasts, but only two detonated. After research and improvement, there were still two blasts that did not detonate. Some people ridiculed me, saying, "Hey! I think it's better to just light it with fire." I didn't lose heart and continued to experiment. I persisted in experimenting six times in two months, and finally succeeded at the end of August last year. The characteristic of the "upper combustion, bottom explosion method" I adopted is that when encountering misfires or detonators that have already been set off, the detonator and lead wire can be rearranged and used, which can save more than 20 minutes of blast hole digging time. More importantly, this can completely eliminate personal accidents during pull-fuse blasting and ensure safe production. This May, I was selected as an advanced worker to participate in the First Engineering Bureau's Advanced Workers Conference. The Engineering Bureau conducted a technical appraisal of my experimental method and believed that this method could be promoted nationwide. I am very happy.
    The Baoji-Tianshui Railway is a very important part of the Northwest railway trunk line. When the Kuomintang reactionaries built this railway, they didn't want to build it well at all, so the quality of the project was very poor. This road was only open for two or three months a year, and it often collapsed, killing many passengers. At that time, the masses circulated such a saying: "Baoji-Tianshui Railway, a blind mess, either collapsing or derailing, when will it be open, no one knows." In recent years, through the selfless labor of our railway workers and some People's Liberation Army troops, the face of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway has been completely renewed. When we see trains loaded with oil from Yumen and furs from the grasslands being transported eastward every day, and large quantities of seamless steel pipes and hardware machinery being transported here from Anshan, Shanghai, and other places, we cannot help but think of the greatness of labor. Now the Northwest railway trunk line is extending towards Xinjiang. I will study hard, find shortcuts, tap potential, and improve production efficiency to build the railways in Northwest China even better.

### 改进拉火雷管消除人身事故

    改进拉火雷管消除人身事故编辑同志：
    我是一个参加祖国西北铁路建设的工人，从一九五一年起就在宝天线上工作。
    在西北铁路建设的工程中，我们每天都要同峭壁岩石作斗争，一不小心，就会造成伤亡事故。因此安全生产就成为我们工程中的重大问题，我们在党的领导下成功地解决了这个问题。
    为了节省材料，第十七工区工人刘景霞创造了一种“动绳拉火底部燃烧爆炸法”，这种方法比起用铁雷管和引线放炮法节省了不少材料，提高了工作效率。但是，这个方法在第二工程段全面推广的时候，先后发生了三次较大的人身事故，影响许多工区都不敢使用这一方法了。我亲眼看见工人陈德才在拉火放炮时炸伤了手和脸，心里有说不出来的难过。我想，我是个共产党员，又是青年团支部书记，党一再号召我们做好安全生产，我怎么能看着自己的工人弟兄被炸伤呢？我又想起张明山创造反围盘消灭了人身事故的事迹，因此我决心改进拉火雷管，消除拉火放炮中的人身事故。
    经过无数次的研究，找到了发生事故的原因。原来拉火放炮的毛病在土雷管的安装上面，土雷管埋在炮眼里，拉火铅线由竹管底部直通到外面，工人在装炮掏炮眼的时候，很容易碰着拉火线，引起爆炸。要是把雷管放在竹管上面，装上火药，就能够避免发生事故。我把自己想的办法和群众商量以后，就利用休息和雨天停工的时间进行试验。可是，试验了几次都失败了。第一次，我放了六炮，只响了两炮，经过研究改进，还有两炮不响。有的人就讽刺我说：“嘿！我看还不如干脆用火点。”我没有灰心，仍继续试验，在两个月中坚持试验了六次，终于在去年八月底试验成功了。我所采用的“上部燃烧，底部爆炸法”的特点是：在拉火放炮时，遇到瞎炮或放过的雷管，只要整理一下雷管和铅线就可以使用，可以节省掏炮眼时间二十多分钟；更重要的是，这样做能够完全消灭拉火放炮时的人身事故，保证安全生产。今年五月，我被评选为先进工作者参加了第一工程局先进工作者大会。工程局对我试验的方法进行了技术鉴定，认为这个方法在全国都可以推广，我心里非常高兴。
    宝天路是西北铁路干线中很重要的一部分。当初国民党反动派修建这条铁路的时候，根本不想把铁路修好，所以工程质量很坏，这条路一年只有两三个月通车，而且经常坍方，砸死了不少的旅客。那时候，群众流传着这样一句话：“宝天路，瞎胡闹，不是坍方就掉道，什么时候通车，谁也不知道。”几年来，经过我们铁路工人和一部分解放军部队的忘我劳动，宝天路的面貌焕然一新。当我们每天看到一列一列的火车满载着玉门的石油和草原上的毛皮往东运去，大批的无缝钢管和五金机械等器材从鞍山上海等地运到这里来的时候，不禁使我想起劳动的伟大。现在西北铁路干线正在向新疆伸展，我一定努力学习，找窍门，挖潜力，提高生产效率，把祖国西北的铁路建设得更好。
