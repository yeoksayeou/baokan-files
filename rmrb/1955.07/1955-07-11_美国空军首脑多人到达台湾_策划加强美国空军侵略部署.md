Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: Headed by U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Cather and Pacific Air Force Commander Smith, multiple U.S. Air Force chiefs from the Pacific and Far East regions arrived in Taipei on the 7th and began talks with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on the 8th. Sources reveal that the main purpose of this gathering of U.S. Air Force chiefs in Taiwan is to strengthen the aggressive deployment of the U.S. Air Force in the Taiwan area.

These U.S. Air Force chiefs will also further study and strengthen the connection between the Far East Air Force units stationed in the Taiwan area and the Pacific Air Force Command, which is responsible for Taiwan's air defense, and study the connection between the U.S. 13th Air Force's recently established task force in Taiwan and the U.S. naval and air forces in the Taiwan area.

In other news, according to a "New York Times" Taipei dispatch, U.S. military advisors are training Chiang bandit jet pilots at an air force base in northwestern Taiwan. The United States has trained approximately 450 Chiang bandit jet pilots in the past two years.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: The United States recently handed over the equivalent of 10 million U.S. dollars to the Chiang bandit "Ministry of National Defense" to help it carry out military orders and construct military projects. This sum of money comes from the U.S. dumping of surplus agricultural products in Taiwan.

According to an announcement by the U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, half of this sum will be used to pay for weapons and ammunition manufactured in Taiwan and delivered to the Chiang bandit army under the U.S. overseas procurement program. The other half will be used for so-called special construction projects, including building barracks for the Chiang bandit Marine Corps and constructing anti-aircraft artillery positions.

In other news, according to the United Press, the United States will give the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique a little over 100 million U.S. dollars in so-called "economic aid" in the fiscal year beginning July 1st. This aid will be concentrated on helping the Chiang bandit army discharge overly aged soldiers and forcibly conscript young people to replace them.

    美国空军首脑多人到达台湾
    策划加强美国空军侵略部署
    新华社八日讯　以美国远东空军司令卡特和太平洋空军司令史密斯为首的太平洋和远东地区美国空军首脑多人，七日先后到达台北，并且从八日开始同蒋介石卖国集团举行会谈。据消息透露，这批美国空军首脑聚集到台湾来的主要目的是要加强美国空军在台湾地区的侵略部署。
    这批美国空军首脑也要进一步研究和加强驻在台湾地区的远东空军部队和负责台湾的空防的太平洋空军司令部之间的联系，并且研究美国第十三航空队新近在台湾建立的特遣部队和台湾地区美国海空军之间的联系。
    另据“纽约时报”台北航讯透露，美国军事顾问正在台湾西北部空军基地训练蒋贼喷气机驾驶员。两年以来，美国已经训练了大约四百五十名蒋贼喷气机驾驶员。
    新华社八日讯　美国最近交给蒋贼“国防部”相当于一千万美元的款项，帮助它进行军事订货和建造军事工程。这笔款项是美国在台湾倾销剩余农产品得来的。
    据美国驻台湾大使馆宣布，在这笔款项中有一半将用来支付在台湾制造的并将根据美国海外采购计划交给蒋贼军的武器和弹药的费用。另外一半款项将用于所谓特别建设工程，其中包括为蒋贼海军陆战队修营房、修建高射炮阵地等。
    另据合众社透露，美国在七月一日开始的会计年度内将给蒋介石卖国集团一亿美元多一点的所谓“经济援助”。这笔援助将集中用来帮助蒋贼军遣散年龄过大的士兵和强征青年人来替换。
