    Striving for a Complete Resolution of the Korean Question
    By Xie Bocheng, Soviet Union

    Two years ago, on July 27, 1953, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in Panmunjom, a remarkable victory for the forces of peace.

    I remember very clearly that unforgettable day that the people of the world anxiously awaited. For the first time in three years of war, many families in North Korea spent the night not in air-raid shelters but in hastily built huts on the ground. On this day, an unusual silence enveloped Korea. Although a large number of American planes carried out a brutal bombing raid on the Supung hydroelectric power station on the eve of the armistice, the electric lights were still flickering in the ruins of Pyongyang, and the blackout curtains were removed from the small windows of the earthen kilns. The people fervently believed that the war would not return to their land.

    Children, who had been frantically searching for places out of the sun just days before, curiously gazed at the kind, warm sun. They had seen too much pain, death, and tears, and would never forget all the things that were imprinted on their sensitive hearts.

    It has been two years since the children—the flowers of Korea—have been living at home, not having to go down into the damp, uncomfortable air-raid shelters at night, studying their lessons quietly, and not hearing the alarm announcing the approach of large formations of enemy aircraft.

    Farmers have filled hundreds of thousands of bomb craters with soil and are working carefree in the rice paddies. In North Korea, the last day of the war was also the first day of the recovery effort. It must be seen with what high labor enthusiasm the soldiers of the People's Army are engaging in work. Throughout the country, not only has the rubble been cleared from the destroyed cities, but also tens of thousands of new houses have been built, and dikes, reservoirs, weirs, irrigation systems, railroads, and countless bridges have been repaired. The destroyed industry is being restored from the ashes.

    Peace has brought abundant fruits to the people, but unfortunately, this is not real peace, but merely an armistice.

    The clanging of weapons has been heard from South Korea. It is known that Syngman Rhee maintains twenty regular infantry divisions that are ready to be mobilized at any time, and has also established another ten reserve divisions. Even during the war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea did not maintain such a large army. Just recently, the South Korean authorities issued an order to mobilize all "underperforming" college and university graduates into the army.

    The Pentagon is continuing to intensify the arming of Syngman Rhee's army with the latest combat technology. Not long ago, the American United Press reported that the South Korean air force had received a batch of F-86 Sabre jet aircraft and a batch of C-46 aircraft from the United States. Currently, Syngman Rhee is using F-86 Sabre jet fighters to form air force squadrons.

    Peace-loving people are listening uneasily to broadcasts from the Seoul radio station. In order to incite the frenzy of war, this radio station is clamoring every day for the abolition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which is supervising the Korean Armistice, and for launching a crusade against the North.

    American officers and soldiers stationed in Seoul, Busan, and other cities in South Korea hope that they will not be suddenly driven to charge the peaks of the Kumgang Mountains, which once became the graveyards of entire divisions of American troops.

    According to official, greatly reduced figures, American manpower losses in Korea were more than 140,000. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote that even this reduced figure "exceeds the total losses suffered by Americans in five major wars combined more than doubled. These five wars are: the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the war with Mexico, the Spanish-American War, and the war against the Philippines." More than 1.2 million Americans participated in the fighting in Korea.

    The Korean War cost the United States a great deal of material. According to the same magazine, the expenditure directly related to the war, as well as the cost of expanding armaments that began because of this war, amounted to $80 billion, and more than 73 million tons of military supplies were transported to the front lines. According to the figures cited by this magazine, more than 20 million tons of liquid fuel alone were consumed.

    The Pentagon lost more than 12,000 aircraft on this small peninsula. Large formations of "Flying Fortresses" destroyed dozens of cities, thousands of villages, as well as some factories, hydroelectric power stations, and reservoirs in North Korea, but they could not change the front line. The elite troops of the most powerful industrial country in the capitalist world remained in the same place where they had launched the war after three years of fighting.

    The Korean Armistice has aroused many bright hopes, making it possible to resolve the Korean issue through diplomatic means, which is what the interests of consolidating universal peace require.

    However, the Korean issue remains unresolved; lasting peace in this country has not been guaranteed, and the reunification of the country on a democratic basis has not been achieved.

    Peace-loving countries have spent a great deal of energy and effort to solve this problem. Last year, much time was spent discussing the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. At that time, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the support of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, put forward a concrete plan that was in line with its own vital interests for restoring the national unity of Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. This plan stipulated: holding all-Korean elections on the basis of the free will of all Korean residents, granting Koreans themselves the right to vote through consultations between North and South Korea (for this purpose, an all-Korean commission should be formed by representatives from both North and South Korea), all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korean territory before the election, and all relevant countries have the responsibility not to allow the war to be launched again and to guarantee the further peaceful development of Korea.

    In view of the intensification of relations between North and South Korea caused by the three-year war, the delegations of the democratic camp countries expressed their support for holding all-Korean elections under the supervision of a neutral international commission.

    However, the stubborn Anglo-American bloc could not put forward any concrete proposals to counter this clear plan. Finally, after repeated delays, the United States finally brought the work of the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue to a standstill.

    The Korean issue continues to make mankind uneasy. This issue remains one of the main items on the political agenda, and it requires a fair solution. This is what the peace-loving people of Asia and other continents are demanding. People cannot endlessly endure the threat of a new sudden attack on their motherland.

    The most important premise and foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea, which is currently artificially divided into two parts, and for the establishment of a unified democratic Korean state, is to give the Korean people the opportunity to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference. To this end, the masses of the people in South Korea are demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops.

    However, the fact that the American generals and Syngman Rhee signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" is well known. According to this treaty, various branches of the American armed forces can be stationed on the territory of South Korea indefinitely. This "treaty" has turned South Korea into an American base for aggression in the Far East.

    It has been two years since the American "Flying Fortresses" stopped dropping bombs on the land of Korea. Two years is a long enough time to reach a decision required by healthy thinking. Now, as Molotov pointed out in his statement at the 10th anniversary of the United Nations, the North and South Koreans should be helped to restore the unity of their country according to the will of the Korean people.

    If lasting peace can be established in Korea in the shortest possible time, it would finally resolve one of the most acute contemporary issues that has long complicated the international situation.

    争取朝鲜问题的彻底解决
    苏联  谢·波诚科
    在两年以前，一九五三年七月二十七日，由于爱好和平的各国人民的努力，在板门店签订了朝鲜停战协定，这是和平力量的卓越胜利。
    我非常清楚地记得这个为全世界人士所焦急期待的令人难以忘怀的日子，北朝鲜的很多家庭在三年战争期中，第一次不在防空洞里而是在地面上匆匆盖起的小屋子里过夜。在这一天，一种异乎寻常的静寂笼罩了朝鲜。虽然大群的美国飞机在停战前夕最后一次地对水丰发电站进行了残暴的轰炸，但是在平壤市的残垣断壁中，电灯光仍然在闪烁着，并且土窑的小小窗洞上的遮光物也撤掉了。人民热烈地相信，战争不会再回到他们的土地上。
    几天以前还在惊慌地到处寻找不见天日的地方的孩子们，好奇地望着亲切的、暖和的太阳。他们看见了太多的痛苦、死亡和眼泪，并且终生忘不掉所有这些印在他们的善感的心灵上的事物。
    孩子们——朝鲜的鲜花，在家里住着，夜间不用下到那潮湿的、不舒服的防空洞里去，他们安静地学习功课，听不到报告大队敌机临近的警报声，这样已经两年了。
    农民们用土填平了几十万个弹穴，无忧无虑地在稻田里耕作。在北朝鲜，战争的最后一天也就是开始恢复工作的第一天。必须看到，人民军的战士是用多么高的劳动热情来从事工作。在全国不仅清除了各个被破坏的城市中的瓦砾，而且还建筑了数万幢新房子，修复了堤坝、水库、水堰、灌溉系统、铁路和无数的桥梁。在从灰烬中恢复着被破坏的工业。
    和平为人民带来了丰厚的果实，但遗憾的是，这还不是真正的和平，而仅仅是停战。
    从南朝鲜方面传来了武器的铿锵声。大家知道，李承晚保有二十个随时可以出动的正规步兵师，并且还建立另外的十个预备师。甚至在对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行侵略战争时期，南朝鲜都没有保持过这样庞大的军队。就在不久前，南朝鲜当局还发出一道关于动员所有“成绩不良”的高等学校毕业生和大学生入伍的命令。
    五角大楼正在继续加紧用最新式的战斗技术装备来武装李承晚的军队。不久以前，美国的合众社报道说，南朝鲜的空军从美国获得了一批F—86佩刀式喷气式飞机和一批C—46飞机。目前，李承晚正在用F—86佩刀式喷气式驱逐机编组空军大队。
    爱好和平的人们不安地收听着汉城电台的广播。这个电台为了煽起战争的狂热，每天都在叫嚣撤销监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会，并向北方发动十字军征讨。
    驻扎在汉城、釜山和南朝鲜其他城市的美国军官和士兵们希望他们不致突然被驱使着向金刚山的各山头去冲锋，过去这些山头曾经一度成为整师整师的美军的坟地。
    根据官方的、被大大缩减了的数字，美国在朝鲜的人力的损失为十四万余人。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志写道，即便这个被缩减的数字“也超过了美国人在五次大的战争中所遭受的损失的总和一倍多。这五次战争是：独立战争，一八一二年的战争，与墨西哥的战争，西美战争和对菲律宾的战争。”有一百二十多万美国人参加了在朝鲜的战斗。
    朝鲜战争耗费了美国大量的物质。根据同一杂志宣称，仅是同进行战争直接有关的支出，以及因这一战争而开始的扩充军备的耗费，就达八百亿美元，运往前线的军用物资达七千三百多万吨。根据这个杂志援引的数字，仅液体燃料就消耗了两千多万吨。
    五角大楼在这片不大的半岛上就损失了一万二千多架飞机。大群的“飞行堡垒”炸毁了北朝鲜的数十个城市，数千个乡村，以及一些工厂、水电站和水库，但是它们并不能使战线发生变化。这个资本主义世界最强大的工业国家的精锐部队，在进行了三年的战争以后，仍停留在当初发动战争的原来地点。
    朝鲜的停战唤起了很多光明的希望，它使通过外交途径解决朝鲜问题成为可能，而这正是巩固普遍和平的利益所要求的。
    但是朝鲜问题仍然悬而未决；这个国家的持久和平还没有保证，全国在民主基础上的统一还没有实现。
    爱好和平的各国人民曾费了很多的精力和努力来解决这个问题。去年，在日内瓦会议上曾用了很多的时间来讨论朝鲜问题。当时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团在苏联和中国代表团的支持下，提出了一个具体的、符合本国切身利益的恢复朝鲜的国家统一并和平解决朝鲜问题的方案。这个方案规定：在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上实行全朝鲜的选举，以南北朝鲜协商的办法给朝鲜人本身以选举权（为此，应当由南北朝鲜双方代表组成全朝鲜委员会），在选举前一切外国军队应从朝鲜领土上撤出，一切有关的国家都有不容许再发动战争并保证朝鲜进一步和平发展的责任。
    民主阵营国家的代表团鉴于因三年战争所引起的南北朝鲜之间关系的尖锐化，曾表示赞成在中立国的国际委员会监督下举行全朝鲜的选举。
    可是，顽固的美英集团提不出任何具体建议来和这个明确的方案相对抗。最后，经过一再拖延，美国终于使日内瓦会议在朝鲜问题上的工作停顿下来。
    朝鲜问题继续使人类感到不安。这个问题仍然是政治日程上的主要项目之一，它要求给予公正的解决。这就是亚洲及其他洲的爱好和平的人民所要求的。人民是不能无止境地忍受对自己祖国的新的突然攻击的威胁的。
    使目前被人为地分裂为两部分的朝鲜和平统一并建立统一的民主朝鲜国家的最重要的前提和基础，就是要在没有任何外国干预的条件下给朝鲜人民以自行决定其命运的机会。为此，南朝鲜的人民群众正在要求一切外国军队撤出去。
    但是，美国的将军们和李承晚签订所谓“共同防御条约”的这件事，是人所共知的。按照这个条约，美国的各种兵种可以在南朝鲜的领土上无限期地驻扎下去。这个“条约”使得南朝鲜变成了美国在远东的侵略基地。
    美国的“飞行堡垒”停止向朝鲜的土地上抛掷炸弹已经两年了。两年这一个长时期是尽足以通过健康的思想所要求的决议的。现在，正如莫洛托夫在联合国十周年纪念会上的声明中所指出，应当帮助南北朝鲜人，按照朝鲜人民的意志来恢复他们国家的统一。
    如果在最短期内能够在朝鲜确立持久的和平，那就会使长期以来使国际局势复杂化的这个当代最尖锐问题之一获得最后的解决。
