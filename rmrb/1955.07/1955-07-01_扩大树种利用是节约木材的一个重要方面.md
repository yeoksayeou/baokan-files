Expanding the Utilization of Tree Species is an Important Aspect of Saving Timber
　　Deng Fu
　　China has a vast territory, spanning the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, and grows a wide variety of woody plants, from tropical rubber to frigid spruce. There are currently over five thousand known species of woody plants in the country; among them, more than two thousand are coniferous and broad-leaved trees, including over fifty genera unique to China. Currently, more than one hundred and twenty species can be produced. Such a rich variety of tree species is rare in the world. This is a characteristic of China's forest resources and also a characteristic of China's timber production.
　　Because there are many tree species, the number of various trees is also different. In addition, most of China's current timber production is still seasonal handicraft production. Therefore, timber of various tree species cannot be produced proportionally, nor can only a few commonly used tree species be produced while discarding other tree species. Therefore, timber-using departments should try to expand the range of tree species used, so that all kinds of timber can be utilized. Especially in the context of insufficient forest resources in China, expanding the utilization of tree species is a central issue in saving timber.
　　To expand the utilization of tree species, timber-using departments must first overcome prejudices and conservative thinking in selecting tree species. Originally, the national "Timber Specifications and Inspection Methods" included several tree species for each type of timber, which was to expand the utilization of tree species so that when one type of timber is lacking, another type can be used as a substitute. However, timber-using departments often only want to use one or a few kinds of timber based on past usage habits, mechanically applying foreign standards, or blindly "following trends." When the timber they want is lacking or insufficient, they are unwilling to use other timber as substitutes. This creates a situation where certain tree species are in short supply while others are heavily stockpiled. In the past two years, almost every timber-using unit was vying for Korean pine; in the past year, they have all been vying for ash. Such timber demand is obviously very blind. From North China to the Yangtze River coast, fir from southern China is generally used for purlins, rafters, house frames, and even floors, doors, and windows. In recent years, due to insufficient fir production in the south, it has been necessary to replace it with Korean pine and white pine from the Northeast, and many timber-using departments feel unaccustomed to it and refuse to use it. Among the vehicle timber specified by the state, there are nine types produced in the Northeast: oak, ash, elm, birch, Korean pine, scaly bark spruce, Amur corktree, and larch. However, timber-using departments only want Korean pine, ash, and oak. Among the plywood timber specified by the state, there are eight types produced in the Northeast: ash, basswood, birch, elm, oak, Amur corktree, poplar, and alder. However, usage departments in various places insist on only using basswood. As a result, basswood is in short supply, while ash, birch, and other plywood materials are stockpiled. For making tea chest boards, there are many tasteless tree species that can be used, but tea factories only use sweetgum, so it is impossible to guarantee supply. Some timber-using departments also make various special requirements regardless of the actual situation. For example, Harbin Flax Factory only wants pear wood for shuttles; Beijing Winery only wants oak for wine barrels; Yunnan's railway sleepers must use precious chestnut wood. These unreasonable special requirements often cause undue losses to both timber production and usage departments.
　　Is it true that only one or a few kinds of timber can be used for each purpose? This is not the case. The use of timber is determined by its properties. Among the more than one hundred kinds of timber produced in China, many have similar properties, and some are even difficult to distinguish. Every timber-using department has a wide range of timber use. For example, making agricultural tools requires timber that is hard, not easy to crack, rot-resistant, and has a large specific gravity. In the past, only mongolian oak was used; however, among the tree species growing in China, there are oak, chinquapin, stone oak, small-leaved oak, Qingkao, silky chestnut, beech, paper mulberry, and other trees of the Fagaceae family that have similar properties to mongolian oak, and these can all be used to make agricultural tools. Facts have also proven that certain tree species can be substituted for each other in the same use. For example, the raw materials for match factories in North China and Northeast China have always been basswood. Last year, the supply of basswood in the Northeast was tight. After joint research and experiments by the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and other units, it was proved that in addition to basswood, white birch, poplar, and Masson's pine can all be used to make matchboxes and matchsticks. This year, there is not enough basswood again, and plywood factories in various places are feeling the difficulty of raw materials. The plywood factory in Shanghai is using wood from Fujian to trial-produce plywood, and it has been successful. Wooden shuttles in textile factories have always been made of mongolian oak, but they can also be made of other hardwood. There is not much mongolian oak in China, but other hardwood is often stockpiled. It has now been successfully tested that paper mulberry can be used to make wooden shuttles, and experiments are continuing with other tree species. Fully utilizing various tree species for the same purpose can not only save small quantities of high-quality timber with a wide range of uses, but also enable timber-using departments to obtain materials locally, reduce costs, and save transportation for the country.
　　In the past, because timber-using departments selected a narrow range of tree species, the logging in China's state-owned forest areas had to adapt to such requirements; thus, only good timber was logged, not bad timber; only tree species that everyone was willing to use were logged, not tree species that everyone was unwilling to use. This is a destructive production method. Now, the forest industry department has adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to change the past logging methods. In the future, all forest land that should be logged will be logged and transported out, except for the necessary mother trees. This will further expand the production range of tree species, and the quantity of a certain tree species will also be more unstable. If the scope of tree species use is not actively expanded, timber use will encounter greater difficulties, hindering the completion of economic construction tasks. Therefore, timber production departments, usage departments, and forestry scientific research institutions should work together to find ways to expand the utilization of tree species, make the best use of materials, and avoid waste.

　　扩大树种利用是节约木材的一个重要方面
　　邓复
    我国国土辽阔，地跨寒、温、热三带，所生长的木本植物种类繁多，有热带的橡胶，又有寒带的云杉。现在已经知道的木本植物，全国约有五千多种；其中针叶和阔叶乔木有两千多种，这些乔木中属于我国所特有的树种有五十多属，目前能生产的树种也有一百二十多种。树种这样丰富，在世界各国是少有的。这是我国森林资源的一个特点，也是我国木材生产上的一个特点。
    因为树种繁多，各种树木的数量也不一样，再加上我国目前木材生产绝大部分仍然是季节性的手工业生产，所以各样树种的木材不能按比例生产，也不能只生产少数常用的树种而废弃别的树种。因此，用材部门应当尽量扩大使用树种的范围，使各种木材都能得到利用。特别是在我国森林资源不足的情况下，扩大树种的利用是节约木材的一个中心问题。
    扩大树种的利用，首先要用材部门克服选择树种的偏见和保守思想。本来国家规定的“木材规格及检尺办法”内，每项材种都包括有若干树种，就是为了扩大树种的利用，当一种木材缺乏时可用另外一种木材代替。但是，一般用材部门往往根据过去使用的习惯，或者机械地套用外国标准，或者盲目地“赶时髦”，只愿用一种或少数几种木材，遇到他要的那种木材缺乏或不足时，也不愿用别的木材代替。这样，就造成某些树种供不应求同时又有些树种大量积压的现象。前两年，几乎每个用材单位都争着要红松；最近一年来又都争着要水曲柳。这样的用材要求，显然是带有很大盲目性的。华北至长江沿岸各地，一般建筑用的檩、椽、房架甚至地板、门窗都习惯使用江南所产的杉木；近年来由于南方杉木生产不足，不得不以东北红松、白松来代替，许多用材部门就感到不习惯而拒绝使用。国家规定的车辆用材中，东北产的有柞木、水曲柳、栬木、榆木、桦木、红松、鱼鳞松、红皮臭、落叶松等九种，可是用材部门只要红松、水曲柳和柞木三种。国家规定的胶合板用材中，有东北产的水曲柳、椴木、桦木、栬木、柞木、黄菠萝、杨木、桤木等八种，而各地使用部门都坚持只要椴木一种；结果椴木供不应求，水曲柳、桦木等胶合板材却积压着。制造茶叶箱板，本来有很多无味的树种可以使用，但各茶厂都只使用枫香一种，以致无法保证供应。还有些用材部门不顾实际情况，提出各种特殊要求。如哈尔滨亚麻厂只要梨木作梭子；北京制酒厂只要柞木作酒桶；云南的铁道枕木要用珍贵的栗木。这些不合理的特殊要求，常使木材生产和使用部门都受到不应有的损失。
    是不是每一项用途只有一种或少数几种木材可用呢？事实并不如此。木材的用途是由它的性质来决定的，我国所产的一百多种木材中，各种性质近似的很多，有些甚至难于分别出来。每一个用材部门，都有广阔的木材使用范围。像做农具，需要硬度较强、不易开裂、耐腐、比重较大的木材，过去习惯只用麻栎；可是，在我国生长的树种中和麻栎性质相似的就有柞木、槠木、石栎、小叶栎、青栲、丝栗、榉木、楮木以及其他壳斗科的树木，这些都可以用来做农具。事实也证明某些树种在同一种用途上是可以互相代替的。例如华北和东北各地火柴厂的原料，向来是采用椴木；去年东北椴木供应紧张，经林业部、轻工业部等单位共同研究试验，证明除了椴木以外，还有白桦、杨木、马尾松等都可以做火柴盒和火柴杆。今年椴木又不够，各地胶合板厂感到原料困难，上海的胶合板厂就以福建所产的木禾试制胶合板，已经成功。纺织厂的木梭历年来都是用麻栎制造，其实也可以用别的硬杂木制造；我国麻栎不多，别的硬杂木却经常积压；现在已经试验成功用楮木可以做木梭，还在继续试验用别的树种。在同一种用途上充分利用各种树种，不但可以节约数量少、用途广的优良木材，同时各用材部门也能够就近取材、降低成本，还可以为国家节省运输力。
    过去由于用材部门选用树种的范围很窄，我国国有林区的采伐也就不得不适应这样的要求；于是只采伐好材，不采伐坏材；只采伐大家愿用的树种，不采伐大家不愿用的树种。这是一种破坏性的生产方法。现在森林工业部门已经采用苏联的先进经验，改变过去那种采伐办法。今后，凡是应该采伐的林地，除留必要的母树外，一律采伐搬运出来。这样就会使树种的生产范围更加扩大，某一种树种的数量也更不稳定。如果再不积极扩大树种的使用范围，用材就会遇到更大的困难，妨碍经济建设任务的完成。因此，木材生产部门、使用部门和林业科学研究机关应该共同努力，设法扩大树种的利用，使材尽其用，避免浪费。
