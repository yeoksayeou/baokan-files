    Be Vigilant Against Counter-Revolutionary Elements Sabotaging the Party's Policies
    Song Zheng
    The Party's policies possess a clear and profound class nature, centrally representing the interests of our class. The Party's policies stipulate the specific steps and methods for realizing the Party's general line. Therefore, the correct implementation of each of the Party's policies signifies that the Party has achieved victory in the class struggle. Precisely because of this, all counter-revolutionary and reactionary elements naturally hate our policies in the extreme and are most afraid of the correct implementation of our policies. Therefore, they are bound to take sabotaging the Party's policies as an important means of undermining our socialist construction. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's frantic sabotage of the Party's literary and artistic policies is a clear example.
    The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have prescribed correct policies and guidelines for our literary and artistic movement, requiring literary and artistic workers to eulogize workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them, requiring writers to establish a correct worldview, and requiring writers to conduct ideological remolding. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was very clear that the realization of the Party's literary and artistic policies would expose this gang of enemies of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This, of course, posed a great threat to the counter-revolutionary elements, and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was bound to put forward their own set of anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary programs to oppose the Party's literary and artistic policies. They opposed writers mastering the communist worldview; opposed writers conducting ideological remolding; opposed writers integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers; opposed national forms; opposed literature and art serving the current political tasks, and arrogantly opposed the Party's organizational and ideological leadership over the literary and artistic movement. They adopted various despicable two-faced and shameless means to spread these reactionary viewpoints, preventing and undermining the expansion of the influence of the Party's literary and artistic direction. Of course, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's counter-revolutionary activities were not limited to sabotaging the Party's literary and artistic policies. Their reactionary theories were against Marxism-Leninism, against intellectuals establishing a correct worldview, against intellectuals integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and against intellectuals participating in socialist construction.
    One should not think that only counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique who can write articles and compose poems understand how to sabotage the Party's policies. In fact, other counter-revolutionary and reactionary elements also understand that the implementation of the Party's policies means their failure; therefore, whenever they seize an opportunity, no matter in which aspect they are lurking, counter-revolutionary elements will frantically try every possible means to sabotage the Party's policies. For example, ensuring the solid unity of middle and poor peasants is an important policy in the Party's socialist transformation of agriculture. If middle and poor peasants cannot unite closely, agricultural production cooperatives cannot be consolidated and developed. Counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary landlords and rich peasants who resolutely resist socialist transformation are very clear about this; therefore, undermining the unity of middle and poor peasants has become an important means for them to sabotage agricultural production cooperatives. The counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze, who had infiltrated the nationally famous Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, had tried every possible means to undermine the unity of the poor and middle peasants in the cooperative. These counter-revolutionary elements used their positions to attack poor peasants, deduct the income that poor peasants should have received, and forced poor peasants to withdraw from the cooperative; but they said to the middle peasant members: "The poor peasants are always right, it's just that our middle peasants are unlucky," "The poor peasants participate in the cooperative, the land is thin, the labor is weak, and they will ruin the cooperative if they come in." Their purpose was to shake the middle peasants' determination to take the road of collectivization. Wang Chengfu, a reactionary rich peasant who had infiltrated the Xiao Jingchang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yushu County, Jilin Province, also frequently stirred up trouble between poor and middle peasants. When a member without a horse used a cart, he would ingratiatingly shout: "Running a cooperative is just helping poor people, they can use whatever they want, it doesn't matter." Conversely, he would say to middle peasant members who had horses: "There is no system for using horses, and the horses will have to 'crawl into the nest' in two years." This gradually aroused the middle peasants' dissatisfaction with the cooperative, and seven middle peasant households withdrew from the cooperative one after another. The phenomenon of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Party's policy of unity between middle and poor peasants is very common. They always use various occasions to tell the middle peasants that the poor peasants are taking advantage of them; and tell the poor peasants that they will definitely suffer if they are with the middle peasants, so that the middle and poor peasants are not in harmony, and the cooperative cannot be consolidated and developed. The Party's various specific policies on developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation are also targets for counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage. The Party's policy is to distribute dividends according to an appropriate proportion of land and labor. Some counter-revolutionary elements go to households with less labor and say that the distribution of dividends is mainly based on labor, and to households with less land say that the distribution of dividends is mainly based on land, undermining everyone's confidence in increasing income; regarding the issue of labor dividends, the Party's policy is to pay according to labor, but some counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated agricultural cooperatives propose methods of distributing dividends according to the number of people, in order to attack the production enthusiasm of the members and sabotage the cooperative's production plan; in handling all issues of the cooperative, the Party's policy is voluntary and mutually beneficial, and counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary elements either deliberately say that things done according to the principle of mutual benefit have harmed the interests of one party, or deliberately violate the policy of mutual benefit and undermine internal unity. In the unified purchase and sale of grain, counter-revolutionary elements also frantically sabotage the Party's various policies. The Party's policy is to purchase surplus grain, but counter-revolutionary elements insist on spreading rumors among the masses, saying that they want to purchase rations; the Party's policy is to ensure the supply of grain to grain-deficient households, but counter-revolutionary elements deliberately threaten the masses, saying that the government does not guarantee the supply, creating a tense atmosphere, and instigating grain-rich households to also demand supplies from the government, creating chaos for the unified sales work…. In short, as long as the Party puts forward a policy, counter-revolutionary elements and various reactionary elements who hate socialism will use various vicious means to sabotage and prevent the implementation of this policy.
    It is worth noting that some of our comrades have such a strange view that they often limit the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements to murder, arson, theft of intelligence, and attempts to riot, etc., while they do not adequately recognize the seriousness of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Party's policies, or do not recognize it at all. Counter-revolutionary elements murdering, arson, and stealing intelligence can indeed cause great harm to our socialist construction cause; but their distorting the Party's policies and hindering the implementation of the Party's policies will also cause losses to our socialist construction. In agricultural production cooperatives, counter-revolutionary elements killing livestock, burning forage, and sabotaging production will of course affect the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives and affect the confidence of the broad masses of peasants in taking the socialist road; but counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Party's various specific policies, making the middle and poor peasants not united, and making the production enthusiasm of the masses attacked, will also make the agricultural cooperative's production not good, making those who have joined the cooperative want to withdraw, making the peasants outside the cooperative have more concerns about joining the cooperative, and even ruin the agricultural cooperative, causing us to encounter setbacks in this serious class struggle of implementing socialist transformation of agriculture. Moreover, it should also be seen that this kind of counter-revolutionary activity of sabotaging policies is often more concealed and less likely to be detected by us than murder, arson, and theft of intelligence. After being discovered, counter-revolutionary elements can also use "not understanding the policy" and "vague understanding" as excuses to conceal their true colors. The false self-criticisms of the Hu Feng elements are the best proof. Therefore, we must not relax our vigilance in the slightest against this vicious sabotage behavior of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging policies.
    Of course, this does not mean that the Party's policies cannot be correctly implemented, all of which are due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements or reactionary elements. The fact is not like this. In most cases, the Party's policies cannot be implemented because of our lack of experience, the low level of staff, and shortcomings in ideological style; however, there are also many cases where it is indeed because counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary elements are sabotaging; or counter-revolutionary elements use certain shortcomings in our work and exaggerate the shortcomings and errors in the implementation of policies. Therefore, when the Party's policies cannot be implemented, we must conduct investigation and research, make specific analysis, distinguish clearly whether the policies are not implemented well because of the shortcomings in our work, or because of the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, and then take different measures to safeguard the Party's policies. If there is conclusive evidence that it is due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, severe sanctions must be given, and these cases must be used to vigorously educate the masses, improve the revolutionary vigilance of the masses, and fight against counter-revolutionary elements; if it is due to the existence of shortcomings and errors in the work, or counter-revolutionary elements use the shortcomings in our work to carry out sabotage, we must promptly and resolutely correct our shortcomings and errors on the one hand, and attack counter-revolutionary elements on the other hand. We must never think that we can ignore correcting our own shortcomings. Facts have proved that counter-revolutionary elements often use the shortcomings in our work to sabotage policies.
    Of course, deviations and errors in the implementation of policies are difficult to completely avoid. The problem is that we should make the greatest efforts to reduce deviations in the implementation of policies, and at the same time, we should immediately check and correct any shortcomings once they are discovered. This requires our staff to earnestly study policies, the leading organs must specifically explain policies when assigning tasks, must check the implementation of policies when checking work, and resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena that violate policies. The key to doing all this work well lies in greatly strengthening the policy views of our staff, so that everyone truly understands that policies are weapons to ensure that we win in the class struggle. We have shortcomings in this regard. The policy views of some grass-roots staff who directly implement policies are not strong enough. They do not understand the great significance of policies, and even oppose policies and tasks, believing that completing tasks is important, and it does not matter whether policies are implemented or not. Therefore, they neither earnestly study policies, publicize policies, nor earnestly correct deviations in the implementation of policies. Party organizations should help these comrades to correct this tendency to neglect policies, so that everyone realizes that a weak policy view is a weak view of class struggle; the poor implementation of policies is not only a general shortcoming and error in work, but this shortcoming and error will affect our victory in the class struggle and leave loopholes for the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements.
    In the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, we have more specifically realized that we must use a clear class struggle viewpoint to safeguard the Party's policies, prevent the sabotage of all counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary elements, and make the Party's policies become our most powerful weapon to attack the enemy and defeat the enemy.

    警惕反革命分子破坏党的政策
    宋琤
    党的政策具有鲜明的深刻的阶级性，集中地代表本阶级的利益。党的政策规定了实现党的总路线的具体步骤和方法。因此，党的每一项政策的正确实现，就意味着党在阶级斗争中取得了胜利。正因为如此，一切反革命分子和反动分子自然就极端仇恨我们的政策，就最害怕我们的政策正确的贯彻执行，因此他们必然要把破坏党的政策作为破坏我们社会主义建设的一个重要手段。胡风反革命集团疯狂地破坏党的文艺政策就是一个显明的例证。
    党和毛泽东同志为我们的文艺运动规定了正确的政策方针，要求文艺工作者歌颂工农兵、为工农兵服务，要求作家树立正确的世界观，要求作家进行思想改造。胡风反革命集团很清楚，党的文艺政策的实现，就会暴露胡风反革命集团这一伙工农兵的死敌。这当然对于反革命分子是一个极大的威胁，胡风反革命集团就必然要针锋相对地提出他们的一套反社会主义的反革命的纲领来反对党的文艺政策。他们反对作家掌握共产主义世界观；反对作家进行思想改造；反对作家和工农兵结合；反对民族形式；反对文艺为当前的政治任务服务，狂妄地反对党对文艺运动的组织领导和思想领导。他们采取各种卑鄙的两面派的无耻手段来散布这些反动观点，阻止和破坏党的文艺方针的影响的扩大。当然，胡风反革命集团的反革命活动并不限于破坏党的文艺政策。他们的这些反动理论是反对马克思列宁主义，反对知识分子树立正确的世界观，反对知识分子同工农兵结合，反对知识分子参加社会主义建设。
    不能认为只有像胡风反革命集团这样能写文章会作诗的反革命才懂得破坏党的政策。事实上，其他反革命分子和反动分子也懂得党的政策的贯彻就是他们的失败；因此，只要抓到机会，不管是潜藏在那个方面的反革命分子，都要疯狂地千方百计地破坏党的政策。比如保证中农和贫农的巩固团结，是党对农业实行社会主义改造中的一个重要政策。中农和贫农如果不能亲密团结，农业生产合作社就不能巩固和发展。反革命分子和坚决抗拒社会主义改造的反动地主富农对这一点是很清楚的，因此，破坏中贫农的团结就成了他们破坏农业生产合作社的一个重要手段。混进全国著名的金星农林牧生产合作社的反革命分子张来全和张扁则就曾经千方百计地破坏社里的贫农和中农的团结。这些反革命分子利用职权打击贫农、克扣贫农应得的收益，逼迫贫农退社；却又对中农社员说：“贫农啥时候也有理，就是咱们中农倒霉”、“贫农参加社，土地薄、劳力弱，他们进来非把社搞垮不可”，他们的目的是动摇中农走合作化的道路的决心。混入吉林榆树县萧景昌农业生产合作社的反动富农王成富也经常在贫农和中农间拨弄是非。无马的社员使用大车了，他就讨好地嚷嚷：“搞社就是拉帮穷人，随便使啥都行，没关系。”反过来，又对有马的中农社员讲：“使马没个制度，再搞二年马都得‘爬窝’。”这样逐渐引起中农对社不满，先后有七户中农退出了社。反革命分子破坏党的中、贫农团结的政策的现象是十分普遍的。他们总是利用各种场合对中农说贫农沾了中农的光；对贫农又说和中农在一起一定要吃亏，使中农贫农不和，使社不能巩固和发展。党的关于发展农业互助合作的各项具体政策，同样都是反革命分子破坏的目标。党的政策是土地和劳力按适当比例分红，有些反革命分子却去向劳力少的户说分红以劳力为主，向土地少的户说分红以土地为主，破坏大家增加收入的信心；关于劳力分红问题，党的政策是按劳取酬，有些混入农业合作社的反革命分子却提出按人头分红的办法，以打击社员的生产积极性，破坏社的增产计划；在处理社的一切问题上，党的政策是自愿互利，反革命分子和反动分子不是故意把按照互利原则办的事说成是损害了某一方的利益，就是故意违反互利政策，破坏内部的团结。在粮食统购统销中，反革命分子同样疯狂地破坏党的各项政策。党的政策是收购余粮，反革命分子偏偏要在群众中散布谣言，说要收购口粮；党的政策是保证对缺粮户的供应，反革命分子故意威胁群众说政府不保证供应，制造紧张空气，并且煽动有粮户也向政府要求供应，给统销工作制造混乱……。总之，只要党提出一项政策，反革命分子和各种仇恨社会主义的反动分子，就要运用各种恶毒的手段进行破坏，阻止这一政策的贯彻。
    值得引起注意的是，在我们的同志中却有这么一种奇怪的看法，他们把反革命分子的破坏活动常常局限在杀人放火、盗窃情报、图谋暴动等方面，而对反革命分子破坏党的政策的严重性却认识不足，或者根本没有认识。反革命分子杀人放火盗窃情报，固然可以给我们的社会主义建设事业以很大的危害；但是他们歪曲党的政策，阻碍党的政策的贯彻，同样会使我们的社会主义建设受到损失。在农业生产合作社里，反革命分子杀害牲口、焚烧草料、破坏生产，当然会影响农业合作社的巩固和发展，会影响广大农民走社会主义道路的信心；但是反革命分子破坏党的各项具体政策，使中农和贫农不团结，使群众的生产积极性受到打击，同样会使农业合作社的生产搞不好，使入了社的要退社，使社外的农民对入社有了更多的顾虑，甚至会把农业社搞垮，使我们在对农业实行社会主义改造这一严重的阶级斗争中遇到挫折。而且，还应该看到，破坏政策这种反革命活动常常比杀人放火、盗窃情报等更为隐蔽，更不容易为我们所察觉。在发现以后，反革命分子还可以用“不懂政策”、用“认识模糊”等为借口来隐蔽他们的真面目。胡风分子们的假检讨就是最好的证明。因此，无论如何我们都不能对反革命分子破坏政策这种恶毒的破坏行为稍稍放松警惕。
    当然，这决不是说，党的政策不能正确贯彻，就都是由于反革命分子或反动分子的破坏。事实并不是这样的。在大多数的情况下，党的政策不能贯彻，是因为我们的经验不足、工作人员的水平不高以及思想作风上的缺点所造成的；但是，也有不少确实是因为反革命分子和反动分子进行破坏；或者是反革命分子利用我们工作中的某些缺点，夸大了贯彻执行政策中的缺点和错误。因此，当党的政策不能贯彻时，我们就必须进行调查研究，具体分析，区别清楚政策贯彻得不好，究竟是因为我们工作中的缺点，还是因为反革命分子的破坏，而后分别采取不同措施来维护党的政策。如果有确凿的证据证明是因为反革命分子的破坏，就必须给以严厉的制裁，并且运用这些事例大张旗鼓地教育群众，提高群众的革命警惕性，同反革命分子进行斗争；如果是由于工作中存在着缺点和错误，或者是反革命分子利用我们工作中的缺点来进行破坏，我们就必须一面及时地坚决地纠正自己的缺点和错误，一面打击反革命分子。决不能因为是我们自己的缺点就可以不去注意改正。事实证明，反革命分子破坏政策，常常是利用我们工作中的缺点的。
    当然，执行政策中的偏差和错误是很难完全避免的。问题在于我们应该以最大的努力来减少执行政策中的偏差，同时一旦发现缺点，就要立时检查纠正。这就要求我们工作人员认真学习政策，领导机关在布置任务时必须具体交代政策，检查工作时必须检查政策执行情况，并坚决地同一切违反政策的现象进行不调和的斗争。做好这一切工作的关键在于大大加强我们工作人员的政策观点，使大家都真正懂得政策是保证我们在阶级斗争中取得胜利的武器。我们在这方面是有缺点的。一部分基层的直接执行政策的工作人员的政策观点是不够强的，他们不懂得政策的重大意义，甚至把政策和任务对立起来，认为完成任务要紧，政策执行不执行没啥关系。因此，他们既不认真学习政策、宣传政策，也不认真纠正执行政策中的偏差。党组织应该帮助这些同志来纠正这种忽视政策的倾向，使大家认识到，政策观点薄弱，就是阶级斗争的观点薄弱；政策执行得不好，不仅是工作中的一般的缺点和错误，而且这种缺点和错误会影响我们在阶级斗争中取得胜利，给反革命分子的破坏留下了空子。
    在肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中，使我们更具体地体会到，必须用明确的阶级斗争的观点来维护党的政策，防止一切反革命分子和反动分子的破坏，使党的政策成为我们打击敌人战胜敌人的最有力的武器。
