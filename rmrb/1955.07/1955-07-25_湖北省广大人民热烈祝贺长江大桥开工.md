　　Wuhan, July 24th (By our own correspondent) The broad masses of people in Hubei Province and Wuhan City are congratulating the commencement of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge with boundless joy.

　　Zhang Nanxian, a man in his eighties and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, recalled the situation in which the people of Wuhan had longed to build a bridge over the Yangtze River since the Qing Dynasty, but it had not been realized for decades. In his article written to celebrate the commencement of the Yangtze River Bridge, he said: "Things that could not be realized in the past have been realized today. This is the greatness of the Communist Party and the greatness of the working class." Zhang Fangze, a worker at the Wuchang Transportation Station, originally lived near the bridgehead of the Yangtze River Bridge. As soon as he heard that the bridge was to be built, he immediately took the lead in relocating his residence and actively transported materials for the construction of the bridge. He guarantees that in the process of building the Yangtze River Bridge, no matter what transportation tasks there are, he will definitely complete them resolutely. Cai Yitian, the director of an agricultural production cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, said: It is necessary to learn from the spirit of the workers building the Yangtze River Bridge in overcoming difficulties, overcome natural disasters, and strive to complete this year's plan to increase production by 20% to support the Yangtze River Bridge and various aspects of national construction.

　　The early commencement of the Yangtze River Bridge has greatly encouraged the construction enthusiasm of the bridge construction workers. Xu Zonglu, a rigging foreman, and others said: We must strive to perform meritorious service and strive to join the Party in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge and dedicate all our strength to the country. Many people expressed their gratitude to the Soviet people for their help. Peng Min, Director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, said: "The early commencement of the Yangtze River Bridge is inseparable from the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. Without the help of Soviet experts, it would not have been possible for us to complete the technical design and other complex preparatory work of the Yangtze River Bridge in such a short period of one year." Many employees said that they will work harder to learn from Soviet experts in the future to ensure that the Yangtze River Bridge is well built.

    湖北省广大人民热烈祝贺长江大桥开工
    本报武汉二十四日电　湖北省及武汉市广大人民以无限欢欣的心情祝贺武汉长江大桥开工。
    八十多岁的老人、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员张难先回忆起了武汉人民从满清年间就渴望在长江上修建大桥，但是几十年都没有实现的情况他在为祝贺长江大桥开工写的文章中说：“过去不能实现的事，今天实现了。这就是共产党的伟大，工人阶级的伟大。”武昌搬运站工人张方泽原来住在长江大桥桥头附近。他一听说要兴建大桥，马上就带头迁移住处，并且积极搬运修建大桥用的器材。他保证今后在修建长江大桥的过程中，不论有什么搬运任务，一定坚决完成。湖北省谷城县一个农业生产合作社的社长蔡以田表示：要学习修建长江大桥的工人们克服困难的精神，战胜自然灾害，争取完成今年增产二成的计划，支援长江大桥和国家各方面的建设。
    长江大桥的提前开工，使修建大桥职工的建设热情受到很大鼓舞。装吊领工员徐宗鲁等表示：一定要在长江大桥建设中，争取立功，争取入党，把自己的全部力量献给国家。许多人对苏联人民的帮助表示感谢。武汉长江大桥工程局长彭敏说：“长江大桥能够提前开工，是和苏联专家无私的帮助分不开的。如果没有苏联专家的帮助，我们不可能在短短一年的时间内完成长江大桥的技术设计和其他复杂的准备工作。”许多职工表示今后要更加努力向苏联专家学习，保证把长江大桥修好。
