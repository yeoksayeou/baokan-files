　　Two Kinds of Leadership, Two Kinds of Results
　　Xue Ya
    In the struggle to lead the workers and masses in opposing waste and practicing strict economy, there are currently two approaches. One is to be satisfied with general mobilization and appeals, lacking concrete organization and leadership for the workers' and masses' economization activities. Problems that arise are not concretely resolved, and the enthusiasm of the masses declines after a short period of high spirits. The other is that the leadership pays attention to the economization proposals of the workers and masses, strengthens leadership, and assists the masses in overcoming difficulties, which results in the normal development of mass economization.

    The leadership method of the Metal Structure Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry belongs to the former. Near this company, there is a "scrap pile" of more than 600 square meters. From last winter, the company's youth economization team began to look for "treasure" in the snow. They found a large pile of useful "scrap" and showed it to the manager and the Party committee secretary. After seeing it, the manager said: This is a practical education for us! But after receiving this practical education, this manager, apart from also holding mobilization meetings and making general appeals, did not take any concrete measures. The youth economization group of the material issuing workshop saved 68 tons of steel, but it was not recorded on the books, and it was wasted by other departments. Since concrete problems were not resolved, the enthusiasm of the masses naturally cooled down quickly. Now the company's "treasure mountain" remains the same, but it has added some new dust, and the phenomenon of waste has not been eliminated.

    There is also such a case in the Harbin Flax Factory: A worker named Zhang has always cherished state property. When he sees a bit of "scrap," he picks it up and uses it in production. He often does not collect materials from the factory but can complete his tasks. Such things should have been supported and praised by the leadership. Such workers should have been respected by everyone. However, the leaders of the flax factory did not value this advanced figure. As a result, due to the dissatisfaction of some backward workers with this worker, they satirized him and called him "Zhang Scrap."

    The leadership method of the Party organization of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory is the opposite. From January to May 20 this year, the Xiao Yongkun forging group in the forging workshop of this factory used "scrap" to replace more than 8,600 kilograms of good material, made more than 28,000 parts, and saved a lot of wealth for the country. The Party committee of the factory awarded the Xiao Yongkun group the honorary title of "Forging Youth Economization Group" and called on all workers in the factory to learn from them. Now, this experience has been widely promoted in the workshop, and ten groups have used more than 88,000 kilograms of "scrap," worth more than 25,000 yuan. After the "Forging Youth Economization Group" used "scrap," it raised new questions such as how to ensure quality and how to prevent working hours from increasing. The Party organization of the factory specifically helped the workers solve these problems, so the mass economization in this factory has achieved great results.

    From this, it can be seen that mass economization cannot rely solely on large-scale mobilization and general appeals, but must go deep into the masses, carry out concrete leadership, solve the problems that arise, and study and promote the experience of the masses. In this way, the masses' struggle against waste can be launched and deepened, and the goal of saving wealth and accumulating funds for socialist construction can be truly achieved.

　　两种领导两种结果
　　薛雅
    在领导职工群众反对浪费厉行节约的斗争中，目前有两种作法，一种是满足于一般的动员号召，对职工群众的节约活动却缺乏具体的组织领导，发生的问题得不到具体解决，群众的热情高涨不久便消沉下去了。一种是领导上注意职工群众的节约倡议，加强领导，协助群众克服困难，结果就使群众性的节约得到正常的发展。
    重工业部建筑局金属结构公司的领导方法属于前一种。这个公司附近，有一个六百多平方公尺的“废料堆”。从去年冬天起，这个公司的青年节约队，就开始在雪堆里找“宝”。他们找出了一大堆有用的“废料”，让经理和党委书记去看。经理看了以后说：这对我们是一个实际的教育！但这位经理受到实际教育以后，除了也召开动员大会，也作一般号召而外，并没有采取什么具体措施。号料车间青年节约小组节约了六十八吨钢料，可是，账上却没有，原来又被其他部门给浪费掉了。具体问题得不到解决，群众的热情自然很快就冷下去了。现在这个公司的“宝山”依然如故，不过又增添了一些新的灰尘而已，浪费的现象并没有消除。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂也有这样一件事：一个姓张的工人，一向爱护国家财产，他看到一点“废料”，就拾起来用在生产上，他经常不向工厂领材料，却能完成任务。这样的事，本应当受到领导上的支持和表扬的。这样的工人，本应当受到大家的尊敬的。但是亚麻厂的领导人员却没有重视这个先进的人物。结果，由于有些落后工人对这个工人不满，对他进行讽刺，称呼他为“张破烂”。
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂党组织的领导方法同这相反，这个工厂锻冶车间的萧永崑锻工小组，从今年一月开始到五月二十日止，利用“废料”代替了八千六百多公斤的好料，制成了两万八千多个部件，给国家节省了大量的财富。这个厂的党委授予萧永崑小组“锻工青年节约小组”的光荣称号，并号召全厂工人向他们学习。现在，这个经验已在车间普遍推广，有十个小组利用“废料”八万八千多公斤，价值两万五千多元。“锻工青年节约小组”利用“废料”以后，提出了怎样保证质量，怎样使工时不增加等新的问题。工厂的党组织又具体地帮助工人解决了这些问题，所以，这个厂的群众性的节约，就取得了很大成绩。
    由此可见，群众性的节约，不能单靠大会动员和一般的号召，而是要深入到群众中去，进行具体领导，解决发生的问题，研究和推广群众的经验。这样，群众的反浪费斗争才能开展起来和深入下去，真正达到节约财富，积累社会主义建设资金的目的。
