Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
What Zeng Zhuo Did in the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles
Song Yutian, Ma Hanzhang, Zhang Yunxiang

    With extreme anger, we accuse and expose the anti-Party and anti-people crimes of Zeng Zhuo, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in Wuhan.

    During his two years in the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zeng Zhuo not only frequently, actively, and systematically promoted and disseminated Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic ideas among the staff of the Federation, but also intentionally spread many reactionary remarks that slandered and attacked the Party and the leadership of the literary and art circles. When Hu Feng launched and carried out a rampant attack on the Party in 1954, Zeng Zhuo took the opportunity to slander and attack the Party Central Committee for having sectarian ideas in its leadership of literature and art, and for disunity between Party members and non-Party members. He believed that the reason for the backwardness of creation in recent years was due to the sectarianism of the literary leadership. He said, why was Hu Feng's speech so emotional? It was because he had been suppressed for so long. This is completely the same tone as Hu Feng's slander and attack on the Party and the Party's leadership of literature and art. It is proven from this that Zeng Zhuo and his master Hu Feng echoed each other and communicated with each other.

    Zeng Zhuo also carried out the same slander and attack on the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee. During the rectification movement of literature and art in 1952, and the discussion on the issue of the workers' literary and art movement in the spring of 1953, which was caused by the influence of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic ideas promoted by Zeng Zhuo, Zeng Zhuo and some staff members of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles developed opinions that were contradictory to and dissatisfied with the Party's literary and artistic line. Seeing an opportunity, Zeng Zhuo further carried out conspiratorial activities. One day, taking advantage of the opportunity when the staff of the Federation went to his home to discuss work, he talked about the Municipal Party Committee pointing out the errors in his literary and artistic thinking, and pointing out that his understanding of the issue of literature and art serving production was insufficient. However, Zeng Zhuo disagreed with the opinions of the Municipal Party Committee. He said that his speech at the forum of worker authors was also criticized by the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee, and he still did not know where he was wrong. These malicious instigations and attacks by Zeng Zhuo created a mood of dissatisfaction with the Municipal Party Committee among some staff members.

    For two years, Zeng Zhuo has been resolutely resisting the Party's literary and artistic line, opposing "popularization first," belittling mass works, and "improving" according to Hu Feng's literary program, emphasizing "literary characteristics," and hindering and undermining the development of the Wuhan literary and artistic movement. He also caused the relationship between the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to be in an abnormal state for a long time. At the same time, in some reports and speeches he made in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he often talked a lot about his work achievements after coming to the Federation, but rarely mentioned the leading role of the Party. From the above facts, it can be seen how Zeng Zhuo was hostile to the Party organization, resisted the Party's criticism, slandered the Party's leadership, and undermined the Party's literary and artistic line.

    Zeng Zhuo was very hostile to some responsible comrades in the Wuhan literary and art circles, and carried out vicious slander and provocation. These slanders and provocations have no basis whatsoever, and can only show that the anti-Party element Zeng Zhuo is good at using the means of suspicion, jealousy, and slander to achieve his conspiratorial activities of creating disputes, splitting the Party's unity, and usurping the leadership of literary and artistic work. Hu Feng's clique members always like to say, who has opinions with whom, who is not united with whom, who doesn't understand anything, who is incompetent! Whose work is no good!… Zeng Zhuo also described the Wuhan literary and art circles as a mess. From these remarks, we can see Zeng Zhuo's sinister intentions and despicable and shameless methods, which are no different from Hu Feng's.

    In order to expand the influence of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members among young people and establish their prestige, Zeng Zhuo did his best to exaggerate. He shamelessly boasted to some young staff members of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles: "Lü Yuan, Ji Fang, Lu Ling and others are very talented." "Especially Lü Yuan, his poems were really popular when he was in Chongqing." He even boasted about Lu Ling in a nauseating way, saying: "Lu Ling's talent is amazing. He wrote 'The Children of the Landlord' when he was nineteen years old. 'First Snow' was written by him in one night, which is really amazing." He even shamelessly boasted about himself, saying: "I used to write a lot of lyrical poems, and many people said I was a 'Little Shelley'."

    Zeng Zhuo also often adopted cunning double-dealing methods, sowing discord between the Bureau of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and undermining the Party's leadership of the Bureau of Culture. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Bureau of Culture worked together, and the Party Group of the Bureau of Culture led the work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Zeng Zhuo was a member of this Party Group. Regarding many problems existing in the work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, we often asked and hoped that Zeng Zhuo would submit them to the Party Group for study and resolution. Zeng Zhuo said to us: "Okay, I will submit the opinions to the Party Group." Now we know that Zeng Zhuo rarely attended the Party Group meetings on the pretext of being busy with work, or arrived late and left early, and rarely spoke on the pretext of not understanding the situation. But in turn, he said to us: "The Party Group doesn't study, can't solve the problem, what can I do!" He also said: "To be honest, I also have a lot of opinions on the leadership of the Bureau of Culture!" He also tried his best to lower the prestige of the leadership of the Bureau of Culture among the staff, saying: "It is difficult for them to manage new literature and art, and they can't manage it." During the third Literary and Art Congress of Wuhan City, when studying the staffing of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zeng Zhuo always adopted the method of sowing discord to allocate the work of the staff, which led to disharmony between the staff and the leaders, and between the staff themselves. The above facts are sufficient to prove that Zeng Zhuo has consistently adopted the despicable means of double-dealing, and used malicious slander and discord to create contradictions, attack the leadership of the Bureau of Culture, undermine the leadership of the Party Group of the Bureau of Culture, realize his personal hegemonic ambitions, sow discord between the leaders and the staff, and undermine the Party's unity. His sinister intentions can be seen from this.

    Within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zeng Zhuo faithfully implemented Hu Feng's instructions to "woo people," "liaison people," and "strengthen strength," and used the weaknesses of some young people who were ideologically naive and had low artistic levels to woo and deceive them in many ways, so that many staff members were deceived and admired him to the point of worshiping him as an idol. He seized on the weaknesses and shortcomings of some staff members, inquired about the situation among those who were close to him, and openly or covertly carried out discord and created division. He put the staff he considered obedient in the editing positions he could directly control, while discriminating against and squeezing out other comrades. During the Spring Festival this year, he invited the "single" staff members of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to his home for drinks. In a drunken stupor, Zeng Zhuo was so carried away that he declared to them that he planned to transfer Ji Fang to the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles for "work" (it turned out that he had visited Ji Fang in Hangzhou under the guise of official business during the Spring Festival). This was his intentional or unintentional exposure of his fox tail. He wanted to turn the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles into a "base" completely "ruled" by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    Since the launch of the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Zeng Zhuo has carried out a series of activities to undermine this struggle in a planned and strategic manner.

    First, Zeng Zhuo used the method of delaying time and narrowing the scope to obstruct the development of the struggle. After the struggle against Hu Feng was launched, the staff of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles actively demanded to study and participate in the battle, and their enthusiasm was very high. However, Zeng Zhuo repeatedly obstructed and said: "Let's wait and see, the Municipal Party Committee will have a unified arrangement." As a result, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles formed a situation of "remaining dormant and waiting to see" for a long period of time. However, the development of the situation made it impossible for him to continue to delay indefinitely. During the joint meeting of the heads of various departments of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles in March this year, everyone repeatedly raised the demand to participate in the battle. Seeing that one plan failed, Zeng Zhuo came up with another plan, saying: "Hu Feng's problem is a literary problem, only the Literature Department needs to study it. Except for the secretary, general cadres in other departments do not need to participate in the study." Later, the Literature Department submitted a study plan to him, and he said: "Hu Feng's five knives are actually only three knives. The last two knives are not necessary." And he also spread rumors, saying: "According to Beijing's opinion, the study time for the whole country should be greatly shortened."

    The second method Zeng Zhuo used to obstruct and undermine the development of the struggle was to outwardly comply but inwardly resist and deceive the organization. During a joint meeting of various departments in March this year to discuss the work plan, he said: "Propagating materialism and criticizing idealism can be listed as the first item in the plan, because this is how it is arranged throughout the country, but it is not necessarily done in the implementation of the plan."

    The third method Zeng Zhuo used to obstruct and undermine the development of the struggle was to limit the opportunity for staff members to participate in possible learning opportunities. In late March this year, the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association held a membership meeting. One of the main contents of the meeting was to criticize Hu Feng. Comrade Yu Heiding asked the staff of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, especially the Literature Department, to participate in the study as much as possible. However, Zeng Zhuo used the excuse of being busy with work and did not allow most of the staff in the Literature Department to participate, and he himself rarely attended the meeting. He was obviously harboring such a ghost: if everyone participated in the study, grasped the weapons, and became clear-headed, it would be very unfavorable to the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    The fourth method Zeng Zhuo used to obstruct and undermine the development of the struggle was to lure the tiger away from the mountain and engage in sophistry. In February this year, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles wanted to comprehensively examine the work of "Workers' Literature and Art." Zeng Zhuo was afraid that the Hu Feng reactionary theories he had disseminated in this work would be exposed and revealed during the examination. On the one hand, he formulated an examination outline himself, made a mobilization report, and limited the scope of the examination. On the other hand, he arranged for the director of the editorial department, whom he deeply believed had different opinions, to participate in the examination work of the Bureau of Culture, and let the deputy director, whom he considered very obedient, preside over the examination of the publication. He himself did not participate in the examination. Later, he wanted us to discuss his examination summary outline. Although he had to admit in general that it was divorced from politics, he also said that specific problems must be viewed in light of the specific conditions and circumstances at the time, and therefore could not be considered errors. We pointed out at the time that this statement was contradictory. He immediately retorted and said: "Why do you see problems so mechanically!"

    The fifth method Zeng Zhuo used to obstruct and undermine the development of the struggle was to use his authority to place the publication "Workers' Literature and Art" outside the struggle. He not only did not care about publishing articles criticizing Hu Feng in the publication, but when the cadres raised this question, he said: "It is difficult to publish such articles in this kind of popular publication. We cannot demand the same as large publications, and workers may not understand Hu Feng's problem. We don't have to compare with 'Changjiang Literature and Art.' If we can't organize contributions, we can put it aside for the time being." As a result, "Workers' Literature and Art" withdrew from this battle position for a long time. In the past five issues, only two articles related to this aspect have been published, one of which was a fake criticism written by himself under a pseudonym.

    The sixth method Zeng Zhuo used to obstruct and undermine the development of the struggle was to explore the ideological situation of the masses and spread remarks that confused the public. In March this year, Zeng Zhuo pretended to hold a forum to "listen to everyone's reaction to the Hu Feng issue." He learned from the speeches at the forum that some people lacked understanding of some issues, and took the opportunity to say: "If we isolate each of Hu Feng's arguments, it will cause ideological confusion. Some of his arguments are correct, and some are copied from the Soviet Union, so we must look at the problem fundamentally." He also said: "Hu Feng's problem involves philosophical issues, which is very complicated, and criticism is very difficult." As a result, some people were frightened.

    What has been exposed above is only a part of the anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities carried out by Zeng Zhuo in Wuhan. We have worked with him for a long time. Due to our own many shortcomings and mistakes, we have been influenced and deceived by him without realizing it. We will conduct further inspections and criticisms in this regard. Under the leadership and education of the Party, we have recognized the criminal nature of the Hu Feng reactionary clique and its key member Zeng Zhuo. We will continue to expose Zeng Zhuo's criminal activities in Wuhan, and warn Zeng Zhuo: you must thoroughly disarm yourself to the Party and the people!

　　坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
　　曾卓在武汉市文联干了些什么
　　宋玉田　马汉章　张云骧
    我们以极其愤怒的心情，控诉和揭发胡风反革命集团在武汉的骨干分子曾卓的反党反人民罪行。
    曾卓在武汉市文联的两年多以来，在文联的工作人员中间，除了经常地积极地系统地宣扬和传播胡风的反动的文艺思想外，还有意地散布许多污蔑、攻击党和文艺界领导的反动言论。当一九五四年胡风发动和进行对党猖狂进攻的时候，曾卓便乘机污蔑和攻击党中央对文艺的领导有宗派思想，党内外不团结，认为几年来创作落后现象的原因，是由于文艺领导的宗派主义思想所造成的。他说胡风的发言为什么那么激动呢？就是因为压抑得很久的缘故。这同胡风污蔑和攻击党和党对文艺的领导是完全一样的口吻，曾卓同他的主子胡风互通声气，彼此呼应，从这里得到证明。
    曾卓对市委的领导也进行过同样的污蔑和攻击。在一九五二年的文艺整风运动，和一九五三年春天由于曾卓所宣传的胡风反动文艺思想的影响而引起的关于工人文艺运动问题的讨论中，曾卓和文联一部分工作人员对党的文艺方针产生了抵触和不满的意见。曾卓见有机可乘，便进一步进行了阴谋活动。有一天趁文联工作人员到他家里去谈工作的机会，谈到市委指出他文艺思想的错误，指出他对文艺为生产服务的问题认识不足。但曾卓是不同意市委的意见的，他说他在工人作者座谈会上的讲话也受到市委的领导同志的批评，他还不知道错在哪里。曾卓这些恶意的挑拨和攻击的言论，在一些工作人员中造成了对市委不满的情绪。
    曾卓两年来一直坚决抗拒党的文艺方针，反对“普及第一”，轻视群众作品，按照胡风的文艺纲领去“提高”，强调“文艺特质”，阻挠和破坏武汉文艺运动的发展。他还使文联和市工会之间的关系长期处于不正常的状况中。同时，他在文联所作的一些报告和发言中，常常谈了很多自己到文联工作后的工作成绩，但很少提到党的领导作用。从以上事实，可以看出曾卓是怎样敌视党的组织，抗拒党的批评，污蔑党的领导和破坏党的文艺方针的。
    曾卓是非常敌视武汉文艺界的一些负责同志的，而且进行了恶毒的污蔑和挑拨。这些污蔑和挑拨，没有任何根据，只能说明反党分子曾卓善于以猜疑、嫉妒、诽谤的手段，达到他制造纠纷，分裂党的团结，篡夺文艺工作的领导的阴谋活动的目的。胡风集团分子总是爱说，谁同谁有意见呀，谁同谁不团结呀，谁什么也不懂呀，谁怎么不称职呀！谁的作品也不行呀！……曾卓也同样是把武汉文艺界形容得一团糟。从这些言论中，我们可以看到曾卓用心的险恶和手段的卑鄙无耻，同胡风实在是一丘之貉。
    曾卓为了扩大胡风反革命集团分子在青年中的影响，树立他们的威信，就极尽吹嘘之能事。他对文联一些青年工作人员无耻地吹嘘说：“绿原、冀汸、路翎等人，很有才华。”“特别是绿原，他的诗过去在重庆时真是红得发紫。”他更把路翎吹嘘得令人肉麻，他说：“路翎才华惊人，十九岁时写了‘财主的儿女们’，‘初雪’是他在一个晚上写起来的，真了不起。”他更无耻地夸耀自己说：
  “我过去写过很多抒情诗，很多人说我是‘小雪莱’”。
    曾卓还经常采取狡猾的两面派手段，挑拨文化局同文联的关系，破坏文化局党的领导。文联和文化局合署办公，文化局党组领导文联的工作，曾卓是这个党组的成员，同文联工作中存在的许多问题，我们时常要求和希望曾卓提交党组研究解决，曾卓对我们说：“好吧，我把意见提到党组。”现在我们知道，党组开会，曾卓却借口工作忙，很少参加，或参加了也迟到早退，借口不了解情况，很少发言。但反过来又对我们说：“党组不研究，不能解决问题，我怎么办！”他又说：“老实说，我对文化局的领导也有很多意见！”他又极力降低文化局的领导在工作人员中间的威信说：“他们对新文艺很难管，也管不了。”武汉市第三次文代会期间，研究文联的工作人员配备问题，曾卓也总是采用挑拨离间的办法分配工作人员的工作，以致引起了工作人员同领导之间，工作人员同工作人员之间的不协调。以上事实足以证明曾卓一贯采取两面派的卑劣手段，用恶毒的挑拨离间，制造矛盾的方法，打击文化局的领导，破坏文化局党组的领导，实现个人专横的野心，挑拨领导同工作人员之间的关系，破坏党的团结，其用心险恶，由此可见。
    曾卓在文联内部忠实地执行了胡风的“拉拢人”“联络人”“加强实力”的指示，利用一些青年人思想幼稚和文艺水平不高的弱点，多方面进行拉拢和欺骗，使不少工作人员受了欺骗，对他佩服得简直五体投地，当成偶像来崇拜。他抓住一些工作人员的弱点和缺点，在和他接近的人中探听情况，公开地或隐蔽地进行挑拨和制造分裂，他把他认为听话的工作人员放到可以直接掌握的编辑工作岗位上，而对另外的同志则加以歧视和排挤。今年春节，他邀集了文联的“光身汉”工作人员到他家中吃酒，曾卓在醉眼朦胧中竟得意忘形地向他们宣称，他打算把冀汸调来武汉市文联“工作”（原来他春节曾假借公差到杭州见过冀汸）。这是他有意无意暴露了自己的狐狸尾巴，他是想把武汉市文联变成胡风反革命集团所完全“统治”的“据点”。
    在开展对胡风反革命集团的斗争以来，曾卓更是有计划、有策略地进行了一系列的破坏这个斗争的活动。
    首先，曾卓用了拖延时间，缩小范围的方法来阻挠斗争的开展，对胡风的斗争展开后，文联的工作人员都积极要求学习，参加战斗，情绪很高昂，但曾卓却一再阻挠说：“再等等看吧，市委将会有统一布置的。”因而使文联在一个较长期间形成“按兵不动、等待观望”的局面。但形势的发展，使他又不能无限期地偃旗息鼓拖延下去，在今年三月间文联各部负责人联席会议上，大家又一再提出参加战斗的要求。曾卓见一计不成，就再生一计，说：
  “胡风的问题是文学方面的问题，只文学部学习就行了，其他各部除秘书外，一般干部就不必参加学习了。”后来文学部订了学习计划送给他看，他说：
  “胡风的五把刀子，实际上只是三把刀子，后两把可以不必要了。”而且又造谣说：“北京的意见，全国学习的时间都要大大地缩短。”
    曾卓阻挠和破坏斗争开展的第二个方法是阳奉阴违、欺骗组织。在今年三月的一次各部联席会议上讨论工作计划时，他说：“宣传唯物主义、批判唯心主义，可以列在计划的第一位，因为全国都是这样安排的，但在执行计划时就不一定这样做。”
    曾卓阻挠和破坏斗争开展的第三个方法是限制工作人员参加可能参加的学习机会。今年三月下旬中国作家协会武汉分会召开会员大会，会议的主要内容之一是批判胡风，于黑丁同志要文联特别是文学部的工作人员可能时都参加学习。但曾卓却以工作忙为借口，不让文学部大多数工作人员参加，他自己也很少去参加会。他显然是怀着这样的鬼胎的：大家一参加学习，掌握了武器，头脑清醒了，对胡风这反革命集团是非常不利的。
    曾卓阻挠和破坏斗争开展的第四个方法是调虎离山和进行诡辩。今年二月文联要全面检查“工人文艺”的工作，曾卓怕在检查中暴露和揭发了他在这个工作上所散布的胡风反动理论，就一方面自己规定了一个检查提纲，作了动员报告，限制了检查范围，一方面把他深深认为意见不投的编辑部主任，安排去参加文化局的检查工作，而让他认为很听话的副主任主持刊物检查，他自己也不参加检查；后来他要我们讨论他的检查总结提纲，他虽然不得已在总的方面承认是脱离政治的，但他又说在具体问题上必须看当时的具体条件和情况，因而不能算错误。我们当时就提出了这个提法是矛盾的。他马上反打一耙子说：“看问题为什么这么机械！”
    曾卓阻挠和破坏斗争开展的第五个方法是利用职权把“工人文艺”这个刊物置于斗争之外。他不但不关心如何在刊物上发表批判胡风的文章，当干部提出这一问题时，他说：“在这种通俗刊物上发表这类稿子是有困难的，不能和大刊物一样要求，而且工人对胡风的问题未必懂得，我们不必和‘长江文艺’比。如果组织不来稿子，可以暂时放一放。”致使“工人文艺”长期退出这个斗争的阵地，五期以来只发表过两篇有关这方面的文章，其中一篇就是他自己化名写的假批判。
    曾卓阻挠和破坏斗争开展的第六个方法是探索群众思想情况，散布混淆视听的言论。今年三月，曾卓假借举行座谈，“听听大家对胡风问题的反映”。他从座谈会的发言中了解到有些人对一些问题还缺乏认识，就乘机说：“如果把胡风的每个论点都孤立起来看，就会引起思想上的混乱，他有些论点还是对的，有些是从苏联搬来的，所以我们要从根本上来看问题。”又说：“胡风的问题牵涉到哲学上的问题，很复杂，批判很不容易。”因而吓住了一些人。
    以上所揭发的还只是曾卓在武汉所进行的反党反人民的罪恶活动的一部分，我们曾长期和他在一起工作过，由于我们自己存在很多缺点和错误，曾经受过他的影响和欺骗而不自觉，这方面我们将要作进一步的检查和批判。在党的领导和教育下，我们认清了胡风反动集团及其骨干分子曾卓的罪恶本质，我们还要继续揭发曾卓在武汉的罪恶活动，并警告曾卓：必须向党向人民彻底缴械！
