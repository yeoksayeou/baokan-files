Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 24th. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo delivered a statement to Parliament on the evening of the 23rd regarding the government's attitude towards the army issue.

When Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo spoke, Parliament was packed, and many people outside the Parliament building who sympathized with the government's position listened attentively to his statement. As Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo walked out of the Parliament building after making his statement, many people waved to him and asked his government to continue in power.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo gave the members of parliament a detailed account of the government's patient handling of the problem caused by the appointment of the new Army Chief of Staff. Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said that the government believed that there were reasons for appointing Bambang Utojo as the new Army Chief of Staff, because he possessed all the qualifications necessary for the position of Army Chief of Staff. However, this was opposed by a group of senior army officers headed by Colonel Lubis.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo emphasized: "The government believes that even in the event of a government error, the necessary corrections cannot be made by the army, but only Parliament has this right."

He said that despite the government's concessions, senior army officers led by Lubis insisted on revoking the appointment of the new Army Chief of Staff, continued to refuse to hand over command, and refused to accept the measure of suspending Lubis.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo pointed out: "The government has been steadfastly upholding the principles of parliamentary democracy based on the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, and striving to resolve this dispute within the scope of existing laws, through discussions in accordance with Indonesian traditions." However, Lubis and others rejected all the government's suggestions.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo expressed regret that all the government's efforts had failed. He announced, "The government believes that it has fulfilled the provisions of Article 82 of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia in promoting Indonesia's prosperity and upholding the Constitution, laws and other regulations in accordance with the aims and spirit of the Constitution."

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said, "Indeed, the government could have brought the matter to Parliament for resolution, but the government considered it unwise to do so because it wanted to avoid the expansion of the conflict, which might increase national tension and unease."

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo finally announced that the cabinet meeting of July 22, 1955 had unanimously decided that the government would return the mandate to the Vice President immediately after this cabinet meeting, and notify the Parliament meeting on July 23 of this intention.

    印度尼西亚沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理
    向国会发表政府对陆军问题态度的声明
    新华社雅加达二十四日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在二十三日晚间向国会发表了政府对陆军问题态度的声明。
    在沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理发言时，国会里挤得满满的，国会大厦外面也站着许多同情政府立场的人们注意地倾听他的声明。在沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理发表声明后走出国会大厦时，许多人向他招手致意，并且要求他的政府继续执政。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理向国会议员详细地叙述了政府耐心地解决因新陆军参谋长的任命而引起的问题的经过。沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说，政府认为，任命班邦·乌多约为新陆军参谋长是有理由的，因为他具备担任陆军参谋长职务所需要的一切条件。但是这遭到了以卢比斯上校为首的一批陆军高级军官的反对。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理强调说：“政府认为，即使在政府犯了错误的情况下，也不能由陆军方面来作必要的纠正，而只有国会才有这种权利。”
    他说，尽管政府提出了让步的条件，但是，以卢比斯为首的陆军高级军官还是坚持撤销新陆军参谋长的任命，继续拒绝交出指挥权，并且拒绝接受把卢比斯停职的措施。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理指出：“政府一直在坚决维护以印度尼西亚共和国宪法为根据的国会民主的原则，以及在符合印度尼西亚传统的情况下，在现有法律的范围以内举行讨论的办法来尽力解决这一争端。”但是，卢比斯等拒绝了政府的一切建议。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理对于政府的一切努力都归于失败表示遗憾。他宣布，“政府相信，在促进印度尼西亚的繁荣，并且按照宪法的宗旨和精神维护宪法、法律和其他规定等方面，它已经履行了印度尼西亚共和国宪法八十二条的规定。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说，“的确，政府是能够把问题提到国会去解决的，但政府认为这样做是不明智的，因为它要避免冲突的扩大，这种冲突的扩大也许会增加国家的紧张和不安。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理最后宣布，一九五五年七月二十二日的内阁会议已经一致作出决定，政府在这次内阁会议以后立即把委任状退还给副总统，并且把这一意图通知七月二十三日开会的国会。
