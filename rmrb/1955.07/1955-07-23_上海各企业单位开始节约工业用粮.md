Shanghai Enterprises and Institutions Begin to Conserve Industrial Grain Use
Hu Sheng

Shanghai is a large city in our country with a concentration of industry. Each year, industrial grain consumption reaches approximately 270 million catties. During the grain conservation campaign, many industrial grain-using units in Shanghai have experimented with and switched to substitutes, or improved operational techniques to conserve grain, achieving significant results. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation is promoting the use of chemical raw materials such as "water glass" and "caustic soda pulp" to replace sizing in the textile and dyeing industries throughout the city. It is estimated that once fully implemented, this can save more than 8.4 million catties of grain annually. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Chemical Raw Materials Corporation and related factories are experimenting with using konjac (a type of creeping plant) instead of corn or sweet potatoes to produce dextrin. If this substitute is fully adopted, approximately 4.5 million catties of grain can be saved each year. The privately-owned Huaxing Chemical Factory, in the process of alcohol fermentation, has replaced Aspergillus flavus with Aspergillus niger for saccharification and improved operational techniques. The utilization rate of starch from dried sweet potatoes has increased from 84.4% in April to 88.2%. Each 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes can produce 2.2 more catties of alcohol, increasing output by more than 6%. The state-owned Shanghai Alcohol Factory is experimenting with using rice water to produce alcohol. Every 400 catties of rice water can precipitate 60 catties of rice starch, which can produce 1 catty of alcohol. If the rice water starch from approximately 136,000 individuals' food service units is collected, 365,000 catties of dried sweet potatoes can be saved annually. The Technology Section of the Food Industry Department of the Shanghai First Bureau of Light Industry is researching the use of monosodium glutamate mother liquor to make soy sauce (the successfully trial-produced soy sauce has been sent to the Municipal Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Station for testing and is harmless to people's health). If all of Shanghai's annual production of over 2.84 million catties of monosodium glutamate mother liquor is used to make soy sauce, 1.86 million catties of grain can be saved throughout the year. In addition, relevant parties are researching the use of wood chips to produce glucose, and rice bran cake to produce yeast, etc. The above examples demonstrate that the potential for conserving grain in industrial grain usage is significant.

Currently, there is an imbalance in the conservation of industrial grain in Shanghai. There is a large difference in the production rate of the same product among different units. The alcohol yield per 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes ranges from over 36 catties to just over 34 catties in some units. The production rate of wheat starch reaches 43.6% in advanced units, while it is only 41.6% in backward units. Promoting learning from advanced units among these backward units and striving for balanced development can save more grain. This is an issue that should be given attention in the conservation of industrial grain.

In addition, many units still have various phenomena of wasting grain during operation. For example, some maltose factories wash away a lot of rice fragments with water during washing; some food factories randomly discard and scatter flour during dusting; some units do not empty flour bags completely, leaving flour behind; some units do not pay attention to the storage of grain, resulting in insect infestation, rat bites, spoilage, and mildew. For example, the Dahuali Food Factory discovered over 4,000 catties of corn damaged by insects. The Shanghai Grain Bureau alone has washed out more than 60,000 catties of residual flour from recycled flour bags in the first half of this year.

The broad masses of workers and staff in Shanghai's industrial production units attach great importance to conserving industrial grain. Many units have improved operational techniques and adopted substitutes based on suggestions from workers and staff, saving a considerable amount of grain. However, some enterprise leaders do not see the surging enthusiasm of the working masses for increasing production and practicing economy, and do not value the wisdom and creativity of the working class, preventing the smooth implementation of workers' initiatives. For example, the technicians of the Dahuali Food Factory proposed extending the cultivation of the second-generation yeast by one hour to increase the yeast production rate. This suggestion does not require adding equipment or changing the formula. In principle, the leadership should actively support and test it. However, Vice Director Wang of the factory believes that this suggestion has no basis and disagrees with conducting a test. Later, with the support of the Party branch, a preliminary test was carried out, and the result was that yeast production increased from the original 1,700 catties to more than 1,900 catties, and the fermentation rate also increased from the original 700 to 940. Some units only focus on promoting sales and ignore the loss and waste of grain, unwilling to change old practices on the pretext that consumers' habits are difficult to change. In fact, as long as consumers are informed of the reasons and it is explained that this does not affect product quality, consumer habits can be completely changed. For example, using caramel coloring in soy sauce has no nutritional or flavoring benefits. If caramel coloring is not used, Shanghai can save more than 5 million catties of maltose each year, but many soy sauce factory leaders are unwilling to change this habit.

The facts of Shanghai's preliminary implementation of conserving industrial grain demonstrate that: to conserve industrial grain and actively adopt substitutes, on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome conservative thinking and capitalist management thinking, and actively adopt all substitutes that can be adopted. On the other hand, the use of substitutes or changes in operating techniques must also be based on facts, and care must be taken to prevent hasty actions and reduce product quality.

Industrial production departments must regard the work of conserving grain in the industrial system as an important part of the overall grain conservation effort. All items that can be replaced with other items and that do not require grain should be resolutely replaced. Grain must be used sparingly and frugally, and workers and staff should be mobilized to jointly find ways to eliminate waste in industrial grain use.

    上海各企业单位开始节约工业用粮
    沪生
    上海是我国工业集中的大城市，每年工业用粮达二亿七千万斤左右。在节约粮食运动中，上海市许多工业用粮单位，试用和改用代用品或改进操作技术以节约用粮，获得很大成绩。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站正在全市纺织、印染工业中，推广用“泡花碱”“烧碱浆”等化学原料代替浆料，估计全面推广以后，每年可节约粮食八百四十万斤以上。中国化工原料公司上海采购供应站和有关厂正在试用蒟蒻（蔓草名）代替玉米或甘薯制造糊精，如全面采用这种代用品，每年约可节约粮食四百五十万斤。私营华星化工厂在酿造酒精过程中，把黄曲霉改用黑曲霉进行糖化，并改进操作技术，甘薯干的淀粉利用率已由四月份的百分之八十四点四提高到百分之八十八点二，每百斤甘薯干可多生产酒精二点二斤，产量提高百分之六以上。国营上海酒精厂利用淘米水试制酒精，每四百斤米的淘米水可沉淀米浆六十斤，可生产酒精一斤。如收集约十三万六千个人的伙食单位的淘米水米浆，每年就可节约甘薯干三十六万五千斤。上海市第一轻工业局食品工业处技术科研究利用制造味精的母液可制酱油（试制成功的酱油，经送市卫生局防疫站化验，对人民身体健康无害）。如以上海市年产味精母液二百八十四万多斤全部用来制造酱油，全年就可节约粮食一百八十六万斤。此外，有关方面正在研究利用木屑制造葡萄糖，米糠饼制造酵母等等。以上事例说明在工业用粮上节约粮食的潜力是很大的。
    目前，上海市在节约工业用粮中，还有不平衡的现象。在同一产品的制成率上，各单位相差很大。每百斤甘薯干的出酒率，有的出三十六斤以上，有的只有三十四斤多；麦淀粉的制成率，先进的达百分之四十三点六，落后的只有百分之四十一点六。推动这些落后的单位向先进的单位学习，争取平衡发展，就可节约更多的粮食，这是节约工业用粮中应加注意的问题。
    另外，许多单位在操作过程中，还有各种浪费粮食的现象。如有的饴糖厂在淘洗米粞时随水冲去很多；有些食品厂在撒粉时随便扬弃抛撒；有些单位粉袋不倒净留下面粉；有些单位对保管粮食不重视，发生虫蛀鼠咬、变质霉烂等情况。如大华利食品厂发现被虫蛀坏的玉米就有四千多斤。上海市粮食局仅今年上半年回收的面粉袋中，就洗出了六万多斤残粉。
    上海市工业生产单位的广大职工都很重视节约工业用粮。许多单位根据职工的建议，改进了操作技术，采用了代用品，节约了不少粮食。但是，有些企业的领导人员，看不到职工群众增产节约积极性的高涨，不重视工人阶级的智慧和创造，使职工的创议不能顺利推行。如大华利食品厂的技术人员，提出了把第二代酵母延长培养一小时提高酵母制成率的建议，这个建议既不需增添设备，也不用改变配方，照理领导方面是应该积极支持并加以试验的；可是，这个厂的王副厂长却认为这个建议没有什么根据，不同意进行试验。后来，这个建议在党支部的支持下进行了初步试验，结果酵母生产从原来一千七百斤提高到一千九百多斤，发酵率也从原来七百多提高到九百四十。还有些单位只从推销商品着眼，不顾粮食的损耗和浪费，借口消费者的习惯不好改变，不愿改变旧作法。其实只要向消费者讲明道理，说明这样并不妨碍产品质量，消费习惯是完全可以改变的。如在酱油中使用酱色，对营养和调味都没有好处，如不用酱色，上海每年就可节约饴糖五百多万斤，但是不少酱油厂的领导人却不愿改变这种习惯。
    上海市初步推行节约工业用粮的事实证明：节约工业用粮，积极采用代用品，一方面要克服保守思想和资本主义经营思想，凡是能够采用代用品的都要积极采用。另一方面对代用品的使用或操作技术的改变也要实事求是，防止草率从事，降低产品质量。
    工业生产部门要把在工业系统中节约粮食的工作作为整个节约粮食的一个重要部分，凡能用其他物品代替粮食，可以不用粮食的，要坚决不用粮食，必须用粮食的，也要厉行节约，发动职工群众共同想办法，消灭工业用粮中的浪费现象。
