Broad masses of young workers across the country are actively participating in conservation activities. A large number of youth conservation teams, conservation groups, conservation teams, and many youth conservation supervisors have emerged in factories, mines, and basic construction sites across the country. Young people are actively collecting and utilizing waste materials, proposing to transform waste steel into useful machines and tractors for building socialism.

    Under the initiative of young workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, workers from more than 20 factories and mines in Beijing launched a campaign to collect scrap iron. In Anshan, more than 20,000 young workers participated in regular conservation activities. Young workers throughout the city established more than 150 conservation teams, collecting 20,000 tons of scrap steel, non-ferrous metals, and various equipment. Young workers in Jinan, Qingdao, Weifang, and other cities in Shandong Province also enthusiastically engaged in the collection of scrap metal. In Shanghai, nearly half of the young workers participated in this activity, collecting more than 1,600 tons of scrap steel and non-ferrous metals. In Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, more than 1,000 young people organized 32 youth conservation teams, collecting more than 30,000 kilograms of scrap iron and waste materials. More than 3,000 young conservation team members in Changchun City have saved the country nearly 70,000 yuan in wealth from the beginning of this year to late June.

    Some young workers in factories, mines, and basic construction sites have also established youth conservation warehouses and conservation boxes to store the collected materials. Young workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company established more than 220 conservation warehouses and conservation boxes. At a construction site in Wuhan, there is a youth conservation warehouse that has already collected more than 20,000 yuan worth of waste materials.

    Young workers also often bravely expose situations of waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources, and actively propose rationalization suggestions. Young conservation team members of the Fourth Engineering Area of the Changchun First Electromechanical Installation Company took the lead in exposing 166 cases of waste. Zhang Dalai, a stoker on a ferryboat at the Nanjing Ferry Institute of the Shanghai Railway Administration, improved the coal feeding method, saving more than 20 kilograms of coal per ferry trip.

　　全国广大青年职工积极参加节约活动
    全国广大青年职工积极参加节约活动。各地工厂、矿山和基本建设工地上涌现出大批青年节约队、节约班、组和许多青年节约监督岗员。青年们积极搜集和利用废旧材料，他们提出要把废钢铁变成建设社会主义的有用的机器和拖拉机。
    在石景山钢铁厂青年职工的倡议下，北京市二十多个厂矿的职工开展了搜集废铁的运动。在鞍山市有二万多青年工人参加了经常性的节约活动。全市青年工人们建立了一百五十多个节约队，他们收集的废钢铁、有色金属和各种器材已有两万吨。山东省济南、青岛、潍坊等城市的青年职工也热烈投入了搜集废金属的活动。上海市有将近一半以上的青年工人参加了这一活动，他们收集的废旧钢铁和有色金属已有一千六百多吨。江苏省徐州市一千多个青年组织了三十二个青年节约队，已搜集了三万多公斤废铁废料。长春市三千多名青年节约队员，从今年年初到六月下旬已为国家节约了将近七万元的财富。
    有些厂矿和基本建设工地的青年职工还建立了青年节约仓库和节约箱，把搜集来的材料保管起来。鞍山钢铁公司的青年职工建立了二百二十多个节约仓库和节约箱。在武汉市的一个建筑工地上，有一座青年节约仓库，里面已收集了价值二万多元的废料。
    青年职工们还经常勇敢地揭发浪费人力、物力、财力的情形，积极提出合理化建议。长春第一机电安装公司第四工区青年节约队员，曾带头揭发了一百六十六件浪费事件。上海铁路管理局南京轮渡所轮船司炉张大来改进投煤方法，每轮渡一次可节约二十多公斤煤。　（据新华社讯）
