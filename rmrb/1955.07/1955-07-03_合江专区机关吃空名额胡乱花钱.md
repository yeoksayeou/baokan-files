　　Hejiang Special District Authorities Wastefully Spent Money on Empty Positions

To the Editor:

　　At the end of last year, the Hejiang Special District of Heilongjiang Province had a surplus of 14,500 yuan in funds. To deal with this money, the Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the directly subordinate organs of the Hejiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting in late December. The meeting decided to spend all the money before December 31st and proposed a procurement plan to purchase 138 items. Subsequently, the District Committee and the Commissioner's Office sent more than ten cadres to purchase items separately. Because some items were purchased in large quantities, the market experienced a temporary shortage, while the Commissioner's Office and corridors were piled high with goods, making it difficult to walk.

　　What exactly did they buy? Please see: 938 fine porcelain bowls with lids (porcelain teacups), 265 enamel mugs, glass cups, and tea bowls, 267 spittoons. According to the actual number of people in the Commissioner's Office and the District Committee at that time, each person could have been given four sets of tea sets, and almost one spittoon per person. They already had eight blankets, but they bought 19 more Russian blankets and jacquard blankets, and also bought a bolt of white fine cloth to cover the Russian blankets. The Commissioner's Office purchased 1,012 notebooks and 17,280 steel pen nibs, which, distributed according to the actual number of cadres, would give each person six notebooks and 102 pen nibs. In terms of cleaning and hygiene supplies, they bought 120 large brooms, 50 iron dustpans, and 30 sprayers. In terms of cultural and recreational supplies, they had just bought four basketballs and five volleyballs not long ago, but this time they bought ten basketballs, five volleyballs, and 312 ping pong balls. Comrades said: This is enough to last until the successful completion of socialist construction. The District Committee also bought 55 decks of playing cards and 15 tables for playing cards. According to the number of people in the District Committee, every two people could get a deck of cards. There were too many tables for playing cards, and the offices could not accommodate them, so they had to be moved to the dormitories. They already had 19 sets of sofas of various sizes, and cadres at the director level and above had already been fully allocated, but this time they ordered seven more sets. They already had a set of portraits of the great man in the past, but this time they spent 1,100 yuan to buy eleven huge portraits of eight-foot height. Because the size was too large, it was difficult to transport by train, so they had to wait until the ice melted and transport them back by boat on the river. They also bought 87 feet of silk, precious gold velvet, and a large number of coat hooks to decorate the offices.

　　The Hejiang Special District authorities not only have serious waste in purchasing items, but also have serious extravagance in conference receptions. For example, the District Committee held a joint dance party at the end of 1954 for trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other units. At this party, they bought 230 pounds of various fruits, 39 pounds of high-quality pastries, 9 pounds of candy, and tea and cigarettes, spending a total of 133 yuan. When holding a banquet for the county party secretaries' meeting, with only more than 30 guests, they drank 41 bottles of various wines alone.

　　Where did the Hejiang Commissioner's Office and the District Committee get the money to spend? It turned out that when the Hejiang Commissioner's Office did its year-end settlement in 1954, their actual number of personnel was 118 less than the authorized number. In theory, these over-received funds for empty positions should have been handed over in full. However, the Hejiang Commissioner's Office and the District Committee spent this money indiscriminately after collecting salaries for these empty positions, which is a serious violation of financial regulations. However, the person in charge of the Hejiang Special District attributed this error to objective reasons, saying that they have always been very strict with financial regulations, but because the Commissioner's Office was newly established and needed to add some things, they used this batch of funds for empty positions... etc. It can be seen that their understanding of the error is not profound. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee should order the relevant personnel in the Hejiang Special District to re-examine themselves.

### 合江专区机关吃空名额胡乱花钱

　　坚决反对一切浪费行为
　　合江专区机关吃空名额胡乱花钱编辑同志：
    去年年底，黑龙江省合江专区结余了一万四千五百元经费，为了处理这笔钱，合江专署和中共合江地委会直属机关在十二月下旬曾召集了一个紧急会议，会上决定要在十二月三十一日前把这笔钱花完，并提出了购买一百三十八项物品的采购计划。接着地委和专署又派出十多个干部分头四出采购；由于有些物品采购数量很大，市场上一度出现了供不应求现象，而专署的办公室和走廊上却堆满了货物，几乎不好走路。
    他们究竟买了些什么东西呢？请看：细瓷带盖的扣碗（瓷茶碗）九百三十八个，搪瓷茶缸、玻璃盃、茶碗二百六十五个，痰盂二百六十七个；如按当时专署和地委实有人数来分配，每人可以分得茶具四个，痰盂几乎每人一个。原有八条毛毯，却又买了十九条俄国毯子和提花毯，还买了一匹白细布罩在俄国毯子上面。专署购买了一千零十二册笔记本，一万七千二百八十个钢笔尖，按实有干部分配，每人可得笔记本六册，钢笔尖一百零二个。清洁卫生用具方面购买大扫帚一百二十把，铁撮子五十个，喷壶三十个；文化娱乐用品方面不久以前刚买了四只篮球、五只排球，这次又买了篮球十只、排球五只、乒乓球三百一十二只。同志们说：这一下可用到社会主义建设成功了。地委会还买了五十五付扑克，打扑克用的桌子十五张。按地委人数计算每两个人就可分到一付扑克；打扑克的桌子太多，办公室放不下，不得不搬到宿舍去用。大小沙发已有十九套，处长级以上干部都已分配齐全，这次又订购了七套。伟人像过去已有一套，这次又花一千一百元买了十一幅八尺高的巨像，由于尺码过大火车不好运，要等开冻以后用船由江上运回。其他还买了八十七尺绸子、名贵的金丝绒和大量的挂衣钩来装璜办公室。
    合江专区机关，不仅在购买物品方面，有着严重的浪费现象；在会议招待方面，同样有着严重的铺张浪费现象。如地委在一九五四年底召开了一次工会、青年团、妇联等单位的联合跳舞晚会，在这个晚会上买了各种水果二百三十斤，上等糕点三十九斤，糖果九斤以及烟茶等共花去一百三十三元。召开县委书记会议举行宴会，宾主只三十多人，仅各种酒就喝了四十一瓶。
    合江专署和地委机关花的这些钱是从哪里来的呢？原来合江专署一九五四年年终结算时，他们实有人数比编制人数少了一百一十八人，照理这些多领的空额经费应该如数上缴的，然而合江专署和地委机关吃了空名字以后，就把这一笔钱胡乱地花掉了，这是严重地违反财政制度的行为。但是合江专区的负责人对于这一错误却归之于客观原因，说什么他们对财政制度一向是抓得很紧的，因为专署机关成立不久需要添置一些东西，所以才动用了这批空额经费……等。可见他们对错误的认识是极不深刻的。黑龙江省人民委员会应该责令合江专区有关人员重新检讨。　　孜孜
