    Artificial Assisted Pollination Can Increase Corn Production
    Zhu Pirong
    Corn is a monoecious plant with separate male and female flowers. Its male flowers grow at the top of the plant, also called tassels; the female flowers grow in the leaf axils in the middle of the stem, and after maturing, they form ears (also called cobs). When corn blooms, the male flowers scatter pollen, and the female flowers protrude silks. The pollen must fall on the silks of other plants or the same plant to be pollinated and bear fruit. The male flowers on the same plant generally bloom three to five days earlier than the female flowers, and the silks in the middle and lower parts of the ear emerge earlier than the silks in the upper part. Thus, the late-blooming female flowers or the late-emerging silks often do not get enough pollen, making it difficult to set kernels. In addition, if the flowering period encounters bad weather such as extreme heat, drought, rain, or strong winds, it will also affect normal pollination. Poor pollination causes barren tips or missing kernels on the corn ears, reducing yield.
    
    To remedy this loss, artificial means can be used to help corn transmit pollen. This involves manually collecting pollen from the male flowers of corn and scattering it on the silks of the female flowers. This method is called "artificial assisted pollination of corn." Implementing artificial assisted pollination can not only reduce the phenomenon of barren tips and missing kernels on corn ears, resulting in a good harvest in the current year, but also the kernels produced by the combination of corn female flowers and pollen from male flowers of other plants have stronger vitality. Sowing them next year can also result in higher yields.
    
    Artificial assisted pollination of corn is an advanced Soviet experience. In recent years, trials and demonstrations in many areas of our country have also achieved good results. In 1953, the comparative results of the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station's trial showed that artificial assisted pollination of corn could increase production by 7.9 to 18.2 percent in the current year. According to a 1954 survey in Laiwu, Huangxian, Juxian and other counties in Shandong Province, corn that implemented artificial assisted pollination generally increased production by 7 to 8 percent. More than 29,000 mu of corn in Yanshan County, Hebei Province, which implemented artificial assisted pollination, yielded an average of seven jin more per mu than corn without artificial assisted pollination, resulting in a total increase of more than 200,000 jin of corn. The results of trials and promotion in Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces have also been very good.
    
    This year, many regions across the country have expanded the corn planting area. Therefore, vigorously promoting artificial assisted pollination is of even greater value for rapidly increasing corn production. Agricultural leading departments and agricultural technology extension stations in corn-producing areas should seize the time to actively publicize the benefits of artificial assisted pollination to farmers, earnestly do a good job in technical instruction and demonstration, and guide farmers to widely adopt this method to increase corn production.

### 人工辅助授粉，可使玉米增产

    人工辅助授粉，可使玉米增产
    朱丕荣
    玉米是雌雄同株而异花的植物。它的雄花长在植株的顶端，又叫天花；雌花长在茎秆中部的叶腋里，成熟后就结成果穗（也叫棒子）。玉米开花的时候，雄花就散布花粉，雌花则吐出花丝，花粉随风飘落在别株或本株的花丝上，才能受粉结实。同一植株上的雄花一般比雌花要早开三至五天，果穗中下部的花丝又比上部的花丝吐出较早，这样，迟开的雌花或后吐出的花丝，常因得不到充足的花粉，而不容易结实。另外，如果在开花时遇到了酷热、干旱、雨天或大风等不好的气候，也会影响正常授粉。授粉不好，就造成了玉米果穗上的秃顶或缺粒，减低了产量。
    为了补救这种损失，可以用人工来帮助玉米传授花粉。这就是用人工采集玉米雄花的花粉，把它撒布到雌花的花丝上。这种方法叫做“玉米人工辅助授粉”。实行人工辅助授粉，不仅可以减少玉米果穗的秃顶和缺粒现象，当年能得到好的收成；而且玉米雌花和别株的雄花花粉结合后所结的籽粒生活力就比较强，来年播种，还能得到较高的产量。
    玉米人工辅助授粉是苏联的先进经验，近几年来，在我国很多地区进行的试验和示范推广，也收到了很好的效果。一九五三年山西省农业试验场的试验比较结果：玉米人工辅助授粉当年可增产百分之七点九至十八点二。据山东省莱芜、黄县、莒县等几个县一九五四年的调查，实行人工辅助授粉的玉米，一般增产百分之七至八。河北省盐山县实行人工辅助授粉的二万九千多亩玉米，平均每亩比没用人工辅助授粉的多收七斤，共计增产二十多万斤玉米。四川、贵州、广西、陕西、河南等省试行推广的结果也都很好。
    今年全国很多地区都扩大了玉米的种植面积，因此，努力推行人工辅助授粉，对于迅速提高玉米产量就具有更重要的价值。玉米产区的农业领导部门和农业技术推广站应该抓紧时间，积极向农民宣传人工辅助授粉的好处，认真做好技术传授和示范的工作，引导农民广泛采用这种方法，提高玉米产量。
