The production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region, in constructing the Daquangou Reservoir on the west bank of the Manas River, adopted a measure to relocate the soil borrow area, reducing construction costs by 310,000 yuan, equivalent to 5% of the original planned total investment, and accelerating project progress.

Originally, the Daquangou Reservoir planned to extract 66,000 cubic meters of soil from a site four to five kilometers away from the earthen dam; transported by trucks, each cubic meter of soil would cost about 7 yuan. Recently, the construction troops, adhering to the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, repeatedly investigated and studied the Niujuanzi soil borrow area (only over 200 meters away from the earthen dam), which had been studied in 1954 but decided against, and used newly arrived scientific instruments for testing, proving that the soil from this borrow area could be used. This greatly shortened the transportation distance, reducing the cost per cubic meter of soil from 7 yuan to 2.3 yuan, saving more than 310,000 yuan for 66,000 cubic meters of soil.

In addition, the leaders of the reservoir project adopted a rationalization proposal from Huang Qianshan, the captain of the dam construction machinery team, modifying the tractor towing frame, eliminating the need for manual compaction in all dam foundation compaction work, resulting in a savings of more than 2,600 man-days.

### 新疆大泉沟水库工程造价降低

　　新疆大泉沟水库工程造价降低
    新疆军区生产部队在修建玛纳斯河西岸大泉沟水库的工程中，采取了一项改移取土场的措施，降低工程造价三十一万元，相当于原计划工程总投资的百分之五，并可加速工程进度。
    大泉沟水库原计划在距土坝四五公里的地方取土六万六千公方；用汽车运送，每方土约需七元。最近，修建部队本着因地制宜、就地取材的原则，又反复调查研究了一九五四年曾经研究过但决定不使用的牛圈子土场（距土坝只二百多公尺），并用新到的科学仪器作了试验，证明这个土场的土壤可以使用。这样就使运输距离大为缩短，每公方土的成本由七元降低到二元三角，六万六千公方土共可节约三十一万多元。
    此外，水库工程领导方面采用了筑坝工程机械队机长黄乾山的一项合理化建议，改装了拖拉机牵引架，使全部坝基的碾压工作中都不必用人工夯实，结果节省人工二千六百多个。
