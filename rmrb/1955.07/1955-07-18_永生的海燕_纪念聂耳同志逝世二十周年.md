    The Immortal Petrel
    ——Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of Comrade Nie Er's Death
    Xiayan
    Comrade Nie Er, the singer of the Chinese people and the founder of the socialist realism music movement, has been gone for twenty full years since his death on the Kugenuma coast in Japan. He was truly like a petrel before the storm, appearing suddenly and leaving swiftly. In the short three or four years from 1932 to 1935, he used his bold, bright, and confident singing to express to the hundreds of millions of suffering Chinese people his premonition of the revolutionary storm. Gorky wrote in "The Petrel":
    "The storm! The storm is coming! This brave petrel, in the lightning, over the roaring sea, flies triumphantly, this prophet of victory cries: 'Let the storm rage more fiercely!'"
    This is the most appropriate portrayal of our talented artist.
    Comrade Nie Er came to Shanghai, the most turbulent vortex of struggle, in 1932 – on the eve of the approaching storm. At that time, he was just a young man who had just turned twenty. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he joined the "Shanghai Anti-Imperialist League" and the "Soviet Friends Society." He worked selflessly, and in order to have a "stable and correct foothold," he joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1933, when the White Terror was at its worst.
    In just three short years, he created more than thirty immortal songs. These works were all created in the intervals of his participation in intense revolutionary movements. In the revolutionary storm, he truly showed the posture of "flying triumphantly." He acted in dramas, was a movie actor, organized amateur singing groups, "ran errands" for revolutionary work, shut himself in to learn the violin, and traveled a long way to Comrade Ren Guang's house to practice the piano... He never knew fatigue and always "grabbed" at any work to do. He told me more than once, "Which movie needs music? I am grabbing for work."
    "Grabbing work," yes, he not only did not shirk work, he was always grabbing to do work. I remember in 1934, when Comrade Tian Han was arrested, what was left in my hands was a movie story, written on a few pages of ten-line paper, about "Children of the Storm," which the Dian Tong Company had decided to start filming. I rewrote it into a movie script and handed it over to the director. A few days later, when I met Nie Er, his first words were: "I heard there's a theme song at the end of 'Children of the Storm'?" I showed him the movie script, the story of which he already knew, so as soon as he got it, he looked for the last song. He read it twice and quickly said, "Let me compose the music, I'll do it." Before I could even open my mouth, he had already reached out his hand to shake mine. "I'll do it! Leave it to me." He repeated, "Mr. Tian will definitely agree." – This is the "March of the Volunteers," which quickly spread throughout China, gave great encouragement to patriotic people during the Anti-Japanese War, and is today's national anthem.
    Nie Er was like a naive child. He liked flowers, liked books, liked children, liked sports, and liked using all kinds of methods to amuse his friends. In short, he loved life and all the healthy and beautiful things in life. In the society he was in at the time, naivety and honesty were destined to suffer losses. He had been fooled, had lost love, and had been ridiculed and bullied more than once by people he considered "friends," but I had never seen bitterness or sorrow on his face. He can be said to be the embodiment of revolutionary optimism. He went to a place, and that place would immediately emit laughter, vitality, and a vibrant youthful atmosphere.
    Nie Er's optimistic spirit stemmed from his firm confidence in the revolutionary cause. I had seen him gnash his teeth in hatred for the sacrifice and arrest of his comrades, but he understood that only by intensifying work could he most effectively strike back at the enemy. Gorky's description of the petrel is perfectly applicable to Nie Er: "In its cry, there is a longing for the storm, the power of anger, the fire of passion, and the confidence in victory."
    Nie Er has been gone for twenty years. If he were alive, he would only be forty-four years old this year. He died too early. But, Nie Er is dead, Nie Er's spirit, the songs Nie Er created, have definitely become immortal. The Chinese people have already "stood up," and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people "are doing extremely glorious and great things that our predecessors have never done before." I seem to hear Comrade Nie Er's laughter again. Comrade Nie Er is laughing even more heartily.

    永生的海燕
    ——纪念聂耳同志逝世二十周年
    夏衍
    中国人民的歌手、社会主义现实主义音乐运动的奠基人聂耳同志，在日本鹄沼海岸逝世已经整整二十年了。他真像暴风雨前的一只海燕，骤然而来，倏然而去，从一九三二年到一九三五年这短短的三、四年中，用他豪迈明快、充满信心的歌声，对亿万受难的中国人民，表达了他对革命暴风雨的预感。高尔基在“海燕”中写着：
    “暴风雨！暴风雨快到来了！这勇猛的海燕，在闪电中，在怒吼着的海上，得意洋洋地飞翔着，这胜利的预言者在叫喊：‘让暴风雨来得更猛烈吧！’”
    这正是我们这位天才艺术家的最恰当的写照。
    聂耳同志是在一九三二年——暴风雨快要到来的前夕，闯进到上海这个斗争最剧烈的漩涡中来的。当时，他还是刚满二十岁的青年。一到上海，他就参加了“上海反帝大同盟”，参加了“苏联之友社”，他奋不顾身地工作，为了要求自己能有一个“稳定的、正确的立足点”，他在白色恐怖最严重的一九三三年加入了中国共产党。
    在短短的三年中，他创作了三十几首不朽的歌曲。这些作品，全是他在参加紧张的革命运动的间隙中创作出来的。在革命的暴风雨中，他真表现了“得意洋洋地飞翔”的姿态。他演话剧，当电影演员，组织业余歌咏团，为革命工作“跑腿”，关紧了门学小提琴，老远地跑到任光同志家里去练习钢琴，……他永远不知道疲倦，不论什么工作都“抢”着去做。他不止一次同我说，“有那部电影要作曲？我在抢工作。”
    “抢工作”，是的，他不仅不推诿工作，他一直是抢着做工作的。记得一九三四年，田汉同志被捕，留在我手边的是一个电通公司决定了要开拍的、写在几页十行纸上的“风云儿女”的电影故事。我替他改写成电影台本，交给了导演。几天之后遇到聂耳，他第一句话就是：“听说风云儿女的结尾有一个主题歌？”我给他看了电影台本，这个剧本的故事是他早已知道的，所以一拿到手就找最后的那一首歌，他念了两遍，很快地说：“作曲交给我，我干。”等不及我开口，他已经伸出手来和我握手了。“我干！交给我。”他重复了一遍，“田先生一定会同意的。”——这，就是很快地唱遍了中国、在抗日战争中给了爱国人民以极大的鼓舞力量的、今天的代国歌“义勇军进行曲”。
    聂耳像一个天真的孩子。他欢喜花，欢喜书，欢喜孩子，欢喜运动，欢喜用种种方法来逗朋友们开心。总之，他热爱生活，热爱生活中的一切健康、美好的事物。在他当时处身的那个社会，天真老实是注定了要吃亏的。他上过当，失过恋，不止一次受过他所认为“朋友”的人们的奚落和欺侮，但是，我从来没有在他脸上看到过苦闷和忧愁。他可以说是革命乐观主义的化身。他到一个地方，这个地方立刻就会发出欢笑、活跃和一种蓬勃的青春气息。
    聂耳的乐观主义精神，发源于他对革命事业的坚定的信心。我看见过他曾为战友的牺牲和被捕而切齿痛恨，但是他懂得，只有加紧工作才是对敌人的最有效的回击。高尔基对海燕的描写完全适用于聂耳：“在它的叫喊中，有的是对暴风雨的渴望，愤怒的力量，热情的火，和对胜利的信心。”
    聂耳离开我们已经二十年，假如他活着，今年才只有四十四岁，他死得太早了。但是，聂耳死了，聂耳的精神，聂耳创作的歌声，已经肯定地永生不朽了。中国人民已经“起来”，中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，“正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。我仿佛又听到了聂耳同志的笑声。聂耳同志笑得更爽朗了。
