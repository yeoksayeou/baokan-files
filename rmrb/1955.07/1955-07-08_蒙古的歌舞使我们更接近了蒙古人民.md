　　Mongolian Songs and Dances Bring Us Closer to the Mongolian People
　　Ma Hanbing
    In recent days, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, together with the broad masses of people in the capital, have greeted the distinguished guests from Ulaanbaatar, the cultural envoys of the Mongolian people and their army – the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Army – with excitement and joy. People's feelings are entirely understandable, because for many years our two countries have not only been connected by national borders and extremely close ties between the people of both countries, but also share many similarities in customs. Especially in the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the powerful Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, under the command of Marshal Choibalsan, fought side by side with our army and the Soviet Red Army in the vast areas of Chahar, Rehe, and Suiyuan, eliminating a large number of Japanese imperialist invading forces and forcing them to surrender unconditionally. This is not an ordinary friendly relationship, but a deep friendship forged in battle with blood and flesh. The people of our two countries, for the sake of a common ideal and cause, charged into battle together, and once shed precious blood together on the northern land of our motherland. The Chinese people will not forget heroes like Comrade Ayushi, who was wounded five times in the battle against the Japanese invasion in Zhangbei, and insisted on staying on the front line, ensuring the victorious advance of the troops. He blocked countless enemy attacks, and finally, fighting alone, ran out of ammunition and supplies, and heroically sacrificed himself on the land of our motherland. This noble quality, a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, is still praised by the broad masses of Zhangbei and has become a good example for our army to learn from. These comrades-in-arms who once shared life and death, have reunited in our liberated homeland, in the season when flowers are blooming in our capital. No wonder people, with pleasant and joyful feelings, use the houses they built themselves, the vegetables they planted themselves, and treat their comrades-in-arms like relatives.
    The broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the capital not only warmly entertained their distinguished guests, but also equally loved the outstanding artistic performances of the Mongolian people. At the opening ceremony of the performance tour of China by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, the Mongolian artists, through various song and dance forms, expressed the deep friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, the iron-like unity of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the desire of the people of all countries to love peace. At the same time, we can also see the heroic, simple, sincere and enthusiastic spirit of the Mongolian people, and see that the Mongolian people are devoting all their strength to the socialist construction of their motherland, and that they are living in freedom, joy and happiness.
    The entire opening ceremony program was rich in national color and style and possessed extremely refined artistic skills. Many melodious songs and simple and healthy dances led our minds to the towering Altai Mountains, to the picturesque Tuul River, and to the vast Mongolian grasslands.
    In the song "Ode to the Altai Mountains", from the melody of the music, we can imagine the incomparably magnificent scenery of the Altai Mountains: there are countless forests, gurgling rivers, endless treasures, and towering snow-capped peaks. How beautiful and rich are the rivers and mountains of Mongolia! In this beautiful area, many herdsmen lead their flocks of cattle and sheep, grazing on the rich grasslands, singing loudly. In the folk instrumental music "Shargyn Sharagyn Zharuul", we can hear: when dawn comes, a young Mongolian knight, after seeing his beloved girl, rides a Mongolian horse into the vast grasslands, thinking of the beautiful rivers and mountains of his motherland, thinking of the abundant products, thinking of his own happiness, sometimes slowing down, sometimes galloping on horseback. The song not only expresses the inner world of this young knight, but also gives people a very healthy, bright and lively feeling through the change of melody. The song "Song of Youth" expresses the Mongolian youth's selfless labor and joyful mood in the socialist construction of the motherland. The entire tune is full of the breath of life, especially through the outstanding performance of the lead female vocalist, Comrade Dan. Zhabu, bringing people to a jubilant state.
  The Mongolian people are heroic, intelligent and very hardworking. The song and dance
  "Aksala" depicts a Mongolian people's hero who, surrounded by the enemy, seriously injured, still uses his last strength and his ingenuity to shoot arrows at the enemy, and finally wins. This dance has rich and colorful basic movements of national dance, it is distinct, simple and healthy; especially the use of accompaniment singing, accompanying the image expression in the dance, narrates the achievements of this hero, deeply portrays the image of this hero, so that every audience sincerely reveals their respect. In the dance "Happy Labor", the diligence of the Mongolian people is expressed, they plant and harvest their crops in the fields, they celebrate the harvest with singing and dancing; this dance is very gentle and natural, it is not a mechanical simulation of life, but extracts typical movements from life, and expresses it vividly and artistically, the accompaniment of dance and music is also extremely integrated.
    The Mongolian people love peace, and they are constantly working to consolidate and defend world peace. The "Song of Mongolian-Chinese Friendship" expresses a strong, powerful, enthusiastic and sincere feeling, expressing the friendly cooperation, unity and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Mongolian people, and the unbreakable deep friendship; at the beginning of the tune, it expresses the friendly and enthusiastic atmosphere of the two peoples, and gradually turns to a calm, firm and confident mood, thereby telling people that the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, like all peace-loving people in the world, deeply believe that peace will surely defeat war, and that any conspiracies and tricks of war provocateurs will eventually be thoroughly and cleanly shattered in front of these peace-loving people. It should be particularly mentioned here is the "Friendship Dance", the choreographer of this dance, Captain Lobsang Dashi, outstandingly combined the dances of the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia softly, accompanied by the melodious and magnificent tune, highlighting the friendly and enthusiastic atmosphere between the three peoples, and also showing the unparalleled consolidation and strength of the peace camp.
    The people of our capital are able to see our dearest comrades and comrades-in-arms, and appreciate such outstanding Mongolian people's art, we are not only full of joy and excitement, but also proud to have such talented comrades-in-arms.

　　蒙古的歌舞使我们更接近了蒙古人民
　　马寒冰
    最近几天来，中国人民解放军驻京部队的军官、士兵们和首都广大人民一起，满怀着兴奋和喜悦的心情，接待来自乌兰巴托的贵宾、蒙古人民及其军队的文化使节——蒙古人民革命军歌舞团。人们的心情是完全可以理解的，因为我们两个国家，多少年来不但国境相连，两国人民间的来往极密，而且在风俗习惯上，也有着不少共同之处。特别是在抗日战争后期，强大的蒙古人民革命军，在乔巴山元帅的率领下，协同我军和苏联红军，在广大的察哈尔、热河和绥远地区，并肩作战，大量地消灭了日本帝国主义侵略军，迫使其无条件投降。这不是寻常的朋友关系，而是在战斗中，用血肉结成的深厚的友谊。我们两个国家的人民，为着共同的理想和事业，一起冲锋陷阵，也曾经在我们祖国北部的土地上，共同地洒过宝贵的鲜血。中国人民将不会忘记像阿尤喜同志这样的英雄人物，在张北反抗日本侵略的战斗中，他前后五次负伤，坚持不下火线，保证了部队的胜利前进。他挡住了敌人无数次的进攻，最后由于孤身作战，弹尽无援，终于壮烈地牺牲在我们祖国的土地上。这种高贵的品质，高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，迄今还为张北广大群众所传诵，成为我军学习的良好榜样。这些曾经同生共死的战友们，又在我们解放了的国土上，在我们首都百花盛开的季节里重逢，难怪人们满怀着愉快而喜悦的心情，用自己亲自盖起来的房舍，用自己亲自种植的菜蔬，亲人般地款待自己的战友。
    首都广大军民不但热情地款待了自己的贵宾，也同样地热爱着蒙古人民卓越的艺术表演。在蒙古人民革命军歌舞团访华演出开幕式上，蒙古艺术家们，通过了各种歌曲和舞蹈形式，表达了中、蒙两国人民的深厚友谊，表达了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营钢铁般的团结，和各国人民热爱和平的愿望。同时，也可以看到蒙古人民的英勇、淳朴、真挚、热情的精神面貌，可以看到蒙古人民正以全部力量，从事自己祖国的社会主义建设，以及他们处于自由、愉快和幸福的生活里。
    整个开幕式的表演节目中，都富有民族色彩、风格和具有极其精练的艺术技巧，很多悦耳动人的歌曲，朴实健康的舞蹈，把我们的心情引向巍峨雄伟的阿尔泰山上，引向美丽如画的托尔河畔，引向辽阔无垠的蒙古草原。
    在歌曲“阿尔泰山颂”中，从音乐的旋律里，我们可以想像到阿尔泰山无比壮丽的景色：那里有无数的丛林，有潺潺不息的河水，有无穷无尽的宝藏，有高耸入云的积雪的山峰，蒙古河山多么美丽而富饶啊。就在这秀丽的地区，多少牧人们，带领着自己成群的牛羊，在丰盛的草原上放牧，引吭高歌。在民间器乐曲“沙尔根沙尔根照饶”里，我们可以听到：当黎明来临的时候，一位年青的蒙古骑士，在看完了自己心爱的姑娘后，乘着一匹蒙古骏马，迈进辽阔广大的草原，他想到自己祖国的明媚河山，想到物产茂盛，想到自己的幸福，时而挽缰缓行，时而策马奔驰。歌曲不但表现了这位年青骑士的内心世界，并通过旋律的变化，给人们非常健康、明朗而活泼的感觉。在歌曲“青年之歌”中，则表达了蒙古青年在祖国从事社会主义建设中忘我的劳动和愉快的心情。整个曲调充满了生活气息，特别是通过领唱的女演员丹?扎布同志卓越的表演，把人们带往欢欣鼓舞的境地。
  蒙古人民是英勇机智而又非常勤劳的。歌舞
  “阿克萨拉”描绘了一位蒙古人民英雄，在敌人的重重包围中，身负重伤，仍然竭尽最后的力量，使用自己的机智，把箭射向敌人，终于获得胜利。这个舞蹈具有丰富多采的民族舞蹈的基本动作，它是鲜明，朴实和健康的；特别是采用伴唱的方法，伴奏舞蹈中的形象表现，叙述了这位英雄的业迹，深刻地刻划了这位英雄人物的形象，使每个观众都衷心地流露出自己的敬意。在舞蹈“愉快的劳动”中，则表现了蒙古人民的勤劳，他们在田野间种植和收割自己的农作物，他们用歌唱和舞蹈来庆祝丰收；这个舞蹈是非常柔美而自然的，这不是机械的生活模拟，而是摘取生活中典型的动作，形象地、艺术地把它表达出来，舞蹈和音乐的伴同也是极其融合的。
    蒙古人民热爱和平，他们时刻地为着巩固和保卫世界和平而努力。在“蒙中友谊之歌”中，表现了雄厚有力，热情而真挚的心情，表达了中、蒙两国人民的友好合作团结互助，牢不可破的深厚友谊；曲调一开始，就表现出两国人民的友好、热情的气氛，逐渐转入了沉着、坚定而自信的情绪中，从而告诉人们，中、蒙两国人民，正和全世界爱好和平的人们一样，深信和平一定会战胜战争，任何战争挑拨者的阴谋鬼计，终必在这些爱好和平的人们面前，被彻底干净地粉碎无遗。这里应该特别提出的是“友谊舞”，这个舞蹈的编舞者罗布桑达西上尉，杰出地把苏联、中国、蒙古的舞蹈，柔和地组编在一起，伴随着悠扬壮丽的曲调，衬托了三国人民间友好而热情的气氛，也表现了和平阵营的无比巩固和强大。
    我国首都的人民，能够看到我们最亲爱的同志和战友，欣赏了这样卓越的蒙古人民艺术，我们不但满怀愉快和兴奋的心情，并因为有了这样多才多艺的战友而感到自豪。
