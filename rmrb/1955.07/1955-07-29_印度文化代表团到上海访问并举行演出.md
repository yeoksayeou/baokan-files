Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 26th: The Indian Cultural Delegation arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Nanjing on the morning of the 26th for a visit.

At 7:30 PM on the 26th, Liu Jiping, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, hosted a banquet to welcome the Indian Cultural Delegation. Nearly 200 guests attended the banquet.

Liu Jiping spoke at the banquet, saying: Your visit and performances will enable the people of Shanghai to further understand the brilliant Indian culture and art with its beautiful national style, and at the same time, it will allow us to deeply appreciate the profound friendship that is growing between the 900 million people of China and India. Following this, Delegation Leader Chanda delivered a speech in which he suggested that everyone toast to Sino-Indian friendship.

Before the banquet, Delegation Leader Chanda, Secretary Gu Singh, and Stage Supervisor Dr. R. Malate paid a visit to Vice Mayor Liu Jiping of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 28th: The artists of the Indian Cultural Delegation performed for over 10,000 spectators in Shanghai on the evening of the 27th. The vast majority of citizens throughout the city also listened to a live recording of the performance.

The performance began at 8:00 PM. Singer Biswas first sang "Sino-Indian Friendship Song" in Hindi and then in Chinese. This sincere singing evoked a storm of applause from the audience. He sang it twice more at the enthusiastic request of the audience.

A total of ten programs were performed during the evening. Except for the small ballet troupe's "Striving for Friends," which was not repeated due to its length, the other nine programs were repeated from one to five times. After the repeat performance of the Kathakali dance, the performer Krishna Kutty was so moved by the enthusiasm of the audience that he used his graceful dance to portray the scene of the audience and performers being reluctant to part.

The performance ended at 11:45 PM. A group of girls rushed onto the stage with flowers to present them to the distinguished guests. At this moment, the applause from both on and off the stage merged into one. Shanghai Vice Mayor Liu Jiping and others went on stage and shook hands with each of the performers to express their thanks.

The faculty and students of the entire school specially held a welcome concert for the distinguished guests. At the concert, fifteen-year-old student Yang Yusheng played a piano solo "Children's Suite," and folk music teacher and folk artist Ding Xicai sang a solo of the Shaanxi Yulin folk song "Sending Off My Lover." The welcome concert also included performances of the late Chinese famous musician Nie Er's "Dock Workers' Song," as well as a grand chorus, string ensemble, and other programs.

Delegation Leader Chanda and his wife, as well as members of the delegation, also visited the school's buildings and the students' practice rooms.
