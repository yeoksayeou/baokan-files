    We Created Miracles
    Zhou Libo, Delegate to the National People's Congress
    I warmly support the Five-Year Plan, celebrate its announcement, and wish it success.
    This is an unprecedented and large-scale construction plan in our country's history. It will bring us a happier life and a more consolidated national defense. It will create an infinitely beautiful future for all of us, for our descendants.
    Underdeveloped industry, lack of heavy industry, using small plows pulled by hand to cultivate the land, and using foot-powered waterwheels for irrigation – these are the basic reasons why we have been bullied for so many years and suffered from poverty for so long. For many years, patriotic people in China have regarded industrialization as their dream in order to change the situation of a weak country and impoverished people. However, only when the people are in power under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can this dream truly have the possibility of realization.
    The Chinese Communist Party has focused on national industrialization from a very early stage. In 1945, when the Japanese invaders were still trampling on Chinese soil, Comrade Mao Zedong said:
  "Without industry, there is no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." This statement foreshadowed that once the working class and its political party grasped political power, they would begin to implement industrialization.
    Our Party and government did not waste any time. In 1948, when the Kuomintang bandits had not yet been completely eliminated, the Party Central Committee pointed out that the central task of urban work was to take over factories and mines and organize production. After three years of various preparatory work, in 1952, the Party Central Committee put forward the general line for the transition period. In 1954, the First National People's Congress accepted the general line and included it in the Constitution. All these measures prepared the conditions and paved the way for our first Five-Year Plan to create happiness.
    Everyone knows that implementing an industrialization plan in a country with such an underdeveloped economy is not a simple or easy task. The long-term plunder by imperialism and the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang bandits left us with very little heritage from the old China.
    I once visited a steel factory and saw the two iron-smelting furnaces there. One of them was built by Xu Shichang. Xu Shichang was one of the Northern Warlords. It is said that during the First World War, taking advantage of the fact that European and American steel could not come to the East, he built this furnace to make money. Shortly after it was built, the European war ended, and European and American goods flowed eastward again, and the Chinese warlords began to fight each other again. Xu Shichang was defeated and stepped down. The furnace he presided over the construction of was never used for a single day, standing coldly in the open air, abandoned for decades. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, no one used it either. The Japanese invaders used it for a short period. When the Kuomintang took over the factory, the furnace was abandoned again. A worker told me that once, the factory's puppet manager also wanted to use it, and a special American engineer came to the furnace and put on an act, looking it over. After reading it, the American shook his head and said, "It's no good, it's better to order a new one from the United States."
    The new furnace did not come, and the old one was abandoned like that, until liberation.
    In the same steel factory, the workers told me another thing. One day, the so-called "big shots" sent by the Kuomintang to take over the factory suddenly had the whim to establish China's light industry in this steel factory, because light industry can make money. They built a wooden bleaching powder tower near the furnace from the Xu Shichang era, preparing to produce bleaching powder. The wooden tower was built, and the inside of the low-rise small building was covered with tiles. They got the machines from somewhere, but the tower door was too small and the building was too low, and the machines could not be installed. The bleaching powder they were so eager for never came into being.
    When this factory was liberated, the rusty iron-smelting furnace and the strange bleaching powder tower stood facing each other quietly in the open field.
    Why did I talk about this iron-smelting furnace and this bleaching powder tower in such detail? Because I feel that this is a vivid picture of the fate of heavy industry in old China.
    We started our production recovery and industrial construction from such a starting point. It is not difficult to see how fast and how far we have run in the past six years, even though the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea was inserted in the middle.
    After a short three years of recovery, our industrial and agricultural output value has exceeded the highest level in our country's history. Our government, which is wholeheartedly for the people, will invest a total of more than 700 million taels of gold in construction during the Five-Year Plan period. New factories and new industrial cities are emerging across the country; new railways are connected to the railways of the Mongolian People's Republic in the north, and extended to the Leizhou Peninsula in the south. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has already been opened to traffic, and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will also be completed ahead of schedule by the end of next year. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is rapidly extending westward, and by next year, it will reach the Yumen Oilfield.
    New highways, crossing giant ridges and rivers, have already been built on the roof of the world, the Tibetan Plateau.
    Moreover, we are trying to control the huge rivers and manage the Huaihe River, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. In Guanting, Hebei, the working people moved eight mountain tops and blocked the Yongding River. From then on, the Yongding River will be truly Yongding. If the planned Sanmenxia project on the Yellow River and other projects are completed, we will turn the millennia-old myth into reality, and we will see with our own eyes: the turbid Yellow River water turns into clear blue river water.
    Good news is constantly coming from the industrial front. All kinds of steel, all kinds of machines, as well as locomotives, trucks, giant ships and airplanes, etc., which China could not manufacture in the past, can now be manufactured, and some are about to be manufactured.
    By 1957, Anshan Iron and Steel and other newly built and expanded steel plants will produce 4.12 million tons of steel; the country's coal mines will produce 113 million tons of coal. And all the farmers will produce 385.6 billion catties of grain to support industrial construction.
    New achievements and exciting production figures are too numerous to mention. We are fundamentally changing the entire economic face of our motherland. We want to build a strong and highly socialist industrialized country in forty or fifty years.
    All our construction achievements are the result of the unity and efforts of 600 million people, and are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and are inseparable from the selfless and technically superb assistance of the Soviet Union. Because of these three decisive conditions, we have created countless miracles in the past few years. As long as each of us exerts our strength, practices thrift, and redoubles our vigilance to prevent hidden counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging our cause, miracles will continue to happen. Our plan will definitely be overfulfilled. We will definitely be able to build our great motherland into a prosperous and wealthy socialist industrial power.

### 我们创造了奇迹

    我们创造了奇迹
    全国人民代表大会代表　周立波
    我热烈地拥护五年计划，庆贺它的宣布，祝福它的成功。
    这是我国史无前例，规模宏大的建设计划，它将为我们带来更为幸福的生活，更加巩固的国防，它将为我们大家，为我们子孙，创造无限美好的未来。
    工业不发达，没有重工业，用手扶的小犁耕田，用脚踏的水车车水，这是我们多年被欺侮，长期受贫困的基本原因。多少年来，中国的爱国志士，为了改变国弱民贫的状况，都把工业化当作自己的梦想。但是，只有在中国共产党领导下的人民当权的时候，这个梦想，才真正地有了实现的可能。
    中国共产党，从很早的时候起，就把眼光放在国家工业化的上面了。一九四五年，当日寇的铁蹄还在践踏中国土地的时候，毛泽东同志就说了：
  “没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”这一段话，等于预告：工人阶级和它的政党一旦掌握了政权，就要着手实行工业化。
    我们的党和政府一点也没有浪费时间。一九四八年，当时国民党匪帮还没有全部肃清，党中央就指出来了：城市工作的中心，就是接管工矿，组织生产；经过了三年种种准备的工作，一九五二年，党中央提出了过渡时期的总路线，一九五四年，全国人民代表大会第一次会议接受了总路线，并且把它列入了宪法。这一切措施都为我们这个创造幸福的头一个五年计划准备了条件，铺平了道路。
    谁都知道，在我们这样一个经济落后的国家里，实行工业化的计划，不是一件简单的，轻易的事情。帝国主义的长期的掠夺，国民党匪帮腐败的统治，使得我们从旧中国继承下来的基业少得十分可怜。
    我曾到过一个钢铁厂，看见了那里的两盘炼铁的高炉。其中的一盘是徐世昌修的。徐世昌是北洋军阀中间的一个。据说他在第一次世界大战期间，趁着欧美的钢铁不能东来的机会，为了赚钱，修建了这一盘高炉。修好不久，欧战停了，欧美的货物又源源东运，中国的军阀又开始混战。徐世昌打了一个败仗，下了台。他所主持修建的高炉没用过一天，冷落地竖立在空旷的露天底下，一搁几十年。在国民党统治之下，也没有人动用过它。日寇利用了一个短时期。等到国民党接收这个工厂的时候，高炉又搁着了。有位工人告诉我，有一回，工厂伪经理也曾想用它，特别聘请的一个美国工程师来到高炉的跟前，装腔作势，看了一遍。看完以后，这个美国人摇一摇头说：“不行了，还不如上美国订一盘新的。”
    新炉没有来，旧的就是那样子搁着，一直到解放。
    在这同一钢铁厂，工人还对我说了另外一件事。国民党派来接收工厂的所谓“大员”，有一天，心血来潮，突然想在这座钢铁厂里建立中国的轻工业。因为轻工业是能赚钱的。他们在徐世昌时代的高炉的近边，造了一个木头漂粉塔，准备生产漂白粉。木塔盖好了，一层一层低矮的小楼的里边，都铺了磁砖。他们不知从什么地方弄来了机器，但是，塔门太小，楼也太低了，机器安装不进去。他们十分渴望的漂白粉，始终没有出世。
    这个工厂获得解放的时节，生锈的炼铁炉和奇异的漂粉塔，在静静的旷场上遥遥对峙着。
    我为什么要详细地谈起这盘炼铁炉和这座漂粉塔呢？因为我觉得，这是旧中国的重工业的命运的一幅鲜明的图画。
    我们就是从这样的一个起点开始我们的生产恢复和工业建设的奔驰的。不难看见，六年以来，虽说中间还插进了抗美援朝，我们跑得多么快，又多么远了。
    经过短短的三年的恢复，我们的工农业产值已经超过我国历史上最高的水平。全心全意为了人民的我们的政府，五年计划期间，在建设上的总的投资，折合黄金达七万万两以上。新的工厂，新的工业城市，正在全国各地陆续地出现；新的铁路，北面接通了蒙古人民共和国的铁路，南边伸到了雷州半岛，成渝铁路早已通车，宝成铁路也将在明年年底提前完成，兰新铁路正在迅速地往西方延伸，到明年，就要达到玉门油矿了。
    新的公路，穿过巨岭，跨过大河，已经修上了世界屋脊、西藏高原了。
    而且，我们正在设法控制着巨大的河流，治理淮河、黄河和长江。在河北官厅，劳动人民移了八座山头，把永定河拦住，从此，永定河将真正永定了。计划中的黄河三门峡的工程和其他工程如果修成了，我们会把千年的神话变成事实，我们会亲眼看到：浑浊的黄河之水变成清碧的江流。
    可喜的消息不断地从工业战线上传来。从前中国不能制造的各种钢材，各样机器，以及机车，卡车，巨轮和飞机等等，现在有的已经能够制造，有的快要开始制造了。
    到了一九五七年，鞍钢和其他新建和扩建的钢铁厂，就要生产四百十二万吨钢；全国的煤矿，将要生产一亿一千三百万吨煤。而所有的农民会要生产三千八百五十六亿斤粮食，来支援工业的建设。
    新的成就，令人兴奋的生产的数字，是举不胜举的。我们正在根本改变我们祖国的全部经济的面貌。我们要在四五十年的时间里，建成强大的高度社会主义工业化的国家。
    我们的一切建设的成就，是六万万人的团结一心努力的结果，而且是同以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导分不开来的，是同苏联的无私的技术精湛的援助分不开来的。因为有了这三个决定性的条件，几年以来，我们创造了无数的奇迹。只要我们人人发挥自己的力量，厉行节约，又百倍地提高警惕，不让暗藏的反革命分子破坏我们的事业，奇迹就会不断地发生。我们的计划一定能超额完成。我们一定能够把我们的伟大的祖国，建设成为一个繁荣富庶的社会主义的工业大强国。
