Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - "Labor News" published letters from working people in various parts of the Soviet Union on the 5th, protesting the crime of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for detaining the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse."

　　The excavator drivers Markov, Nepogodiev, and Shardayev of the Irkutsk Hydropower Station wrote in their letter: We construction workers are people of peaceful labor. This provocative act, aimed at undermining the peace we are building and exacerbating international tensions, fills us with indignation. Together with all the Soviet people, we firmly demand that these brazen Chiang Kai-shek jailers and their protectors be severely punished.

　　The lathe operator Chumburidze of the Tbilisi Stalin Factory wrote in a letter that it is quite obvious that the US authorities are fully responsible for the robbery of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" and the insults suffered by the Soviet sailors. One can only consider this an action aimed at sharpening the international situation and opposing peace and security. We demand that the "Tuapse" oil tanker and its crew be released and returned to their homeland.

　　The letter from Kamenev, the deputy captain of the Northern Route "Sergei Kirov" ship, protested the illegal actions of the US authorities and their Taiwanese servants and demanded that the crew of the "Tuapse" oil tanker be restored to freedom!

    新华社莫斯科六日电　“劳动报”五日发表了苏联各地劳动人民的一些来信，抗议美国和蒋介石匪帮扣留苏联“图阿普斯号”油船的罪行。
    伊尔库次克水电站的掘土机司机马尔科夫、涅波戈迪耶夫和夏尔达耶夫在他们的来信中写道：我们建筑工人是和平劳动的人。这种旨在破坏我们所建设着的和平和加剧国际紧张局势的挑衅行为，使我们十分愤慨。我们同全体苏联人民一起坚决要求严厉惩办这些蛮横的蒋介石狱卒和他们的庇护人。
    第比利斯斯大林工厂的旋工楚姆布里杰在信中写道，十分明显，美国当局应对苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的被抢劫和苏联海员所遭到的侮辱完全负责。人们只能认为这是目的在使国际局势尖锐化、反对和平和安全的行动。我们要求必须释放“图阿普斯号”油船和船员，并使他们返回祖国。
    北方航线“谢尔盖·基洛夫号”轮船副船长卡麦涅夫的来信抗议美国当局和它的台湾奴仆的非法行动，并要求使“图阿普斯号”油船的船员们恢复自由！
