    Great Motherland, Great Plan
    Xu Simin, Delegate to the National People's Congress
    I arrived in Beijing from Burma, far away from the motherland, with excitement to attend the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.
    The primary task of this meeting was to review and adopt the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. After reading all the documents related to the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and after listening to Minister Li Xiannian's report on the state's final accounts and budget in Huairentang, I was deeply moved and enriched. In the past, overseas Chinese compatriots only learned about the general situation of the economic construction being carried out in the motherland in the years after liberation from newspapers and the narratives of sightseeing groups. Now I have gained an in-depth and specific understanding of many things from the meeting. More fortunately, by reading all the planning documents and from the explanations and precise figures provided by the responsible comrades of the government sent by the State Council, I can thoroughly see the beautiful socialist prospects of the motherland.
    From the documents, I first saw the great achievements made by the motherland in economic recovery from 1949 to 1952. Then, from the First Five-Year Plan from 1953 to 1957, I saw the prospects of the motherland in various aspects such as industry, agriculture, transportation, posts and telecommunications, commerce, training construction cadres, and developing science. Only our great motherland, with its vast land and abundant resources, can have such a great plan.
    During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total expenditure of the state in economic construction and cultural and educational construction will be 76.644 billion yuan. The total industrial output value in 1957 will increase by 98.3 percent compared with 1952. Among them, the growth of modern industry will be 104.1 percent. These figures clearly show that everything in this plan fully conforms to the long-term interests of the people of the whole country. In the state's final accounts for 1954, the total revenue was 30.74583 billion yuan, the total expenditure for the year was 24.63244 billion yuan, and the surplus for the year reached 6.11339 billion yuan. This is an amazing number. At present, the financial budgets of many countries in the world are in deficit, and the annual deficit is an alarming number. Such a surplus in the final accounts as our government has is rare in some other countries. In 1954, the amount of government expenditure on economic construction was 12.35822 billion yuan, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total expenditure for the year; in the same year, the amount of the final accounts spent on national defense was 5.81353 billion yuan, accounting for 23.6 percent of the total expenditure. Comparing these figures with the fact that some imperialist countries use more than 70 percent of their budgets for military expansion, it is clearer than ever who is carrying out peaceful construction today and who is engaged in war preparations.
    "The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it" is the magic weapon used by imperialists and feudal rulers to rule the people; but today, in the motherland where the people themselves are in power, any major national plan is placed before the people for consultation. It not only lets the people "know," but also relies on the people to complete this great construction task.
    The First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, which is in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, will surely receive the full support of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese compatriots, and will be victoriously realized as expected. Let all of us overseas Chinese compatriots and the people of the whole country cheer together for the victory and prospects of the motherland on the economic front!

    伟大的祖国，伟大的计划
    全国人民代表大会代表　徐四民
    我怀着兴奋的心情从离开祖国很遥远的缅甸赶到了北京，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议。
    这次会议首要的任务是审议和通过关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。当我阅读了全部有关发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的文件，当我在怀仁堂里听到了李先念部长关于国家决算和预算的报告之后，我的内心非常感动，并且得到了充实。在过去，国外的侨胞只是从报章上和观光团的口述了解解放后几年来祖国正在进行经济建设的概况，现在我从会议上深入具体地了解了许多。更幸运的是我能够通过阅读全部计划的文件，并从国务院派来的政府负责同志的讲解和精确的数目字中，透彻地看到祖国美好的社会主义远景。
    从文件里我首先看到祖国从一九四九年到一九五二年在经济恢复工作方面取得的伟大成就。以后又从一九五三年到一九五七年的第一个五年计划中看到祖国在工业、农业、运输邮电、商业、培养建设干部和发展科学等各方面的远景。只有我们地大物博蕴藏无穷的伟大祖国，才会有这样伟大的计划。
    在第一个五年计划的期间内，国家在经济建设和文化教育建设方面的支出总数是七百六十六亿四千万元。一九五七年工业的总产值将比一九五二年增长百分之九十八点三。其中现代工业的增长将为百分之一百零四点一。这些数目字清楚地说明这个计划的一切内容完全符合全国人民的长远利益。一九五四年国家决算中收入总数为三百零七亿四千五百八十三万元，本年支出合计为二百四十六亿三千二百四十四万元，本年结余共达六十一亿一千三百三十九万元。这是一个惊人的数目。目前世界各国的财政预算，有很多是入不敷出的，每年的赤字是一个惊人的数目。像我们政府这样结余的决算，在一些其他的国度里是不可多见的。一九五四年政府用于经济建设支出的数目为一百二十三亿五千八百二十二万元，占全年度总支出的百分之五十以上；同年决算用在国防支出的数目为五十八亿一千三百五十三万元，占总支出百分之二十三点六。拿这些数目字同某些帝国主义国家以百分之七十以上的预算用于扩充军备的事实相比，今天是谁在进行和平建设，谁在从事战争准备，看得再清楚也没有了。
    “民可使由之，不可使知之”，这是帝国主义和封建统治者统治人民的法宝；但是今天人民自己掌握政权的祖国，是把任何国家大计都摆在人民的面前同人民商量的。不但叫人民“知”，而且还是依靠人民来完成这伟大的建设任务。
    符合全国人民利益的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，一定会得到全国人民包括海外侨胞的全力支持而预期胜利实现。让我们全体国外侨胞和全国人民一道为祖国在经济战线上的胜利和远景而欢呼吧！
