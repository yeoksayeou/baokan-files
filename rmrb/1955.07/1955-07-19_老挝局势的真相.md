The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos has encountered significant difficulties. The United States is intensifying its interference in the Lao situation. Encouraged and supported by the United States, the Royal Lao Government has long suspended political conferences and recently suspended bilateral military conferences. At the same time, it has launched larger-scale military offensives against the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops. This situation is seriously threatening the stability of the ceasefire in Laos and the implementation of the political settlement clauses.

How did the serious situation in Laos evolve?

Article 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates that the Royal Lao Government should take measures, especially holding general elections in 1955, so that all citizens can participate in national common life. At the same time, according to Articles 14 and 19 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, pending a political settlement, the Lao Issara troops are assembled in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua, and the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops should be respected by the Royal Lao Government, which shall not take any hostile actions.

The Lao Issara troops have faithfully implemented and abided by the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Lao Issara troops once liberated half of the national territory of Laos, including the entire provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. Organizations of the Lao Issara troops were also present in the other ten provinces of the country. However, for the sake of peace and the independent and unified interests of the motherland, the Lao Issara troops withdrew from the whole country and assembled in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos issued a statement on November 22, 1954, expressing "satisfaction" with the implementation of this important clause. The chairman of the Lao International Commission, Kosala, specially praised the spirit of the withdrawing troops in overcoming difficulties and fulfilling the agreement.

However, the Royal Lao Government does not "respect the territory under the military control of the other party," and constantly launches military offensives in an attempt to divide and occupy the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. These two provinces had no French troops or Royal troops at the time of the ceasefire. However, after the ceasefire, the Royal Government, with the support of French troops and American interventionists, constantly airdropped and infiltrated armed forces into these two provinces. These illegally deployed and infiltrated armed personnel established strongholds locally, recruited scattered armed bandits and outlaws, forcibly conscripted young men, and falsely claimed to be Royal troops originally stationed in the area. At the same time, the Royal Government troops repeatedly attacked the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops and occupied Muong Boen and other places in Sam Neua province.

Due to the spirit of reconciliation of the Lao Issara troops and their efforts to seek consultation, on March 9 this year, the two sides reached an agreement to cease all hostilities, and the Royal Government "guaranteed that no hostile actions—especially military offensives—against the Lao Issara troops would recur." However, the Royal Government did not fulfill this guarantee, but expanded the offensive, making the military conflict increasingly serious. On June 7, a spokesman for the Royal Government publicly stated that "military measures" would be taken against the Lao Issara troops. Now, the Royal troops have indeed launched a new offensive against the Lao Issara troops, and have gathered a large number of troops, including aircraft and paratrooper units, around Sam Neua province, preparing to take larger-scale military actions.

While taking these hostile actions, the Royal Government, in order to conceal its violation of the Geneva Accords, constantly falsely accuses the Lao Issara troops of attacking them. But these false accusations have repeatedly gone bankrupt. As everyone knows, the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos has conducted many investigations in the past, and the results have proved that the Royal Lao Government's accusations against the Lao Issara troops are completely fabricated. On the contrary, the investigation confirmed the facts of the Royal Government airdropping personnel and supplies to Ou Nu, Ou Xi and other places in the assembly area of the Lao Issara troops, attacking the Lao Issara troops and looting the people, etc.

While carrying out military offensives against the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops, the Royal Government also violated the express provisions of the Geneva Accords by implementing a policy of terror in the other ten provinces, stifling democratic freedoms, and arresting, killing, and carrying out other retaliatory acts against former resistance personnel and patriotic citizens.

The Royal Lao Government's abandonment of political consultation methods, and its willingness to continue and expand hostile actions, in an attempt to solve problems by military means and deprive the Lao Issara troops and former resistance personnel of their right to participate in national common life without discrimination, runs counter to the spirit of the Geneva Accords.

In order to realize the democratic unification of the motherland, the Lao Issara troops have made great efforts to seek a political solution. On November 4 last year, the representative of the Lao Issara troops issued a statement recognizing the Royal Lao Government; and announced that, in principle, the administrative institutions of Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces are under the supreme supervision of the Royal Lao Government. Subsequently, the Lao Issara troops actively strived to negotiate with the Royal Government to resolve political issues.

This effort by the Lao Issara troops was supported by the Lao people, and bilateral political conferences began on January 18. This conference issued a joint statement, indicating that both sides were willing to "simultaneously implement the Geneva Armistice Agreement in order to jointly consolidate peace, bring freedom and democracy to the people, and achieve unification and national independence." The statement also stated that both sides "will seek all possible ways to resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, with a view to achieving satisfactory results." However, the Royal Government did not abide by this joint statement, but stubbornly insisted on its propositions that were inconsistent with the Geneva Accords, did not consider the reasonable suggestions of the Lao Issara troops, and interrupted the political conference six times. Moreover, it launched a military offensive just a few days after the aforementioned joint statement was issued.

At the political conference from April 19 to 24, the two sides agreed to establish a political consultation committee to implement the Geneva Accords. However, the Royal Government delegation insisted that the political consultation committee should be placed under the control of the Royal Government, and that it would only discuss the issue of separating the armed forces of both sides in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua and the issue of establishing Royal Government institutions in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. This suggestion clearly violated the principle of equal consultation between the two sides, and attempted to forcibly divide and abolish the assembly area of the Lao Issara troops, regardless of the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Due to this arrogant attitude of the Royal Government, the conference failed to reach an agreement on the functions and tasks of the consultation committee.

After this political conference was interrupted, the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Kingdom, Katay Don Sasorith, even declared that there was no need to establish a political consultation committee, and that it would be enough to establish a "surrender committee" or something similar. Subsequently, the Royal Government began to take unilateral actions, appointing "governors" for the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and establishing "provincial administrative committees" in Muong Boen and Pang Nu. At the same time, it also announced that it would hold unilateral elections that excluded the participation of the Lao Issara troops, and actively carried out preparations for this so-called election, and has so far refused to consult with the Lao Issara troops on the issue of arranging elections. These measures of the Royal Lao Government are all serious violations of the Geneva Accords.

Due to this series of actions by the Royal Lao Government that violated the Geneva Accords, a serious situation has been created in Laos after the ceasefire.

It must be pointed out that the current serious situation in Laos is created single-handedly by Washington, and it is inseparable from the United States' interference, instigation, and incitement.

The United States cobbled together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and forcibly included Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into their "protected" areas. At the same time, it planned and organized the "Mekong River Group" of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. In order to undermine the stability of the ceasefire in Laos, the United States established a so-called branch of the "Foreign Operations Administration" in Laos in November last year, allocating aircraft and combat materials to supply the Royal Lao Government to attack the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops. Subsequently, the United States planned to sign a military assistance agreement with Laos in order to turn Laos into a US military base and further drag Laos into a military bloc.

It is precisely in order to achieve this goal that the United States has been trying its best to incite military conflicts in Laos and obstruct the political settlement in Laos. After Dulles attended the Bangkok Conference in February this year, he personally ran to Laos to incite the expansion of military conflicts. In his speech, he nakedly instigated the Royal Government to "suppress" the Lao Issara troops, "try to restore" "control" over the assembly areas of the Lao Issara troops, and said that the Manila Treaty would provide support.

Recently, the United States launched a strong propaganda offensive, trying its best to distort the truth of the Lao situation, misinterpret the Geneva Accords, and slander the Lao Issara troops; at the same time, it allocated 12.2 million US dollars to the Royal Lao Government to support its expansion of military offensives against the Lao Issara troops. The "New York Times" publicly stated on June 23 that the United States "welcomed" the Royal Lao Government's determination to "take military measures."

The recent military conference of the Manila Treaty Organization convened by the United States exposed the US plot to interfere in the Lao situation. According to Agence France-Presse, the conference "carefully studied the situation in Laos" and "adopted concrete measures against the communists" to prepare for "a state of emergency." The Manila Treaty Council also held a special meeting on the Lao issue, attempting to expand the military conflict in Laos and create a tense situation.

This interference by the United States, which violates the Geneva Accords, is a serious threat to the national interests and the interests of peace in Laos. The Lao Issara troops and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos have suggested resuming the political consultation conference. For the sake of the national interests and the interests of peace in Laos, the Royal Lao Government should cease military actions and sincerely seek a political settlement in Laos in order to realize the democratic unification of Laos and consolidate peace in Laos.

    老挝局势的真相
    李高
    日内瓦协议在老挝的执行遭遇了重大困难。美国加紧干涉老挝局势。在美国的鼓励和支持下，老挝王国政府早已中断了政治会议，最近又中断了双方军事会议，同时向寮国战斗部队集结区发动了更大规模的军事进攻。这种情况正严重地威胁到老挝停战的稳定和政治解决条款的实施。
    老挝的严重局势是怎样演成的呢？
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条规定，老挝王国政府要采取措施，特别是在一九五五年内举行普选，使全体公民都能参加全国共同生活。同时，根据老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四、十九条的规定，在等待政治解决期间，寮国战斗部队集结在丰沙里和桑怒两省地区，寮国战斗部队的集结地区应受到老挝王国政府的尊重，老挝王国政府不得采取任何敌对行动。
    寮国战斗部队忠实地执行和遵守着日内瓦协议的规定。寮国战斗部队曾解放了老挝全国领土的一半，其中丰沙里和桑怒两省已全部解放，全国其他十省也都有寮国战斗部队的组织。但寮国战斗部队为了和平和祖国独立统一的利益，从全国撤退和集结到了丰沙里和桑怒两省。老挝国际委员会在一九五四年十一月二十二日曾发表声明，对于这一重要条款的履行表示“满意”，老挝国际委员会主席科斯拉并特别赞扬了撤退的部队克服困难、履行协定的精神。
    但是，老挝王国政府却不“尊重对方军事控制下的领土”，不断发动军事进攻，企图分割和占领丰沙里和桑怒两省。这两省在停战时是没有法国军队和王国部队的。但停战后，王国政府在法国部队和美国干涉者的支持下，不断将武装部队空投和渗入到这两省。这些非法地投入和渗入的武装人员，在当地建立据点，收罗零星的武装土匪和不法分子，强征壮丁，捏称是原在当地的王国部队。同时，王国政府军队还一再进攻寮国战斗部队集结地区，并攻占了桑怒省的芒奔和其他地方。
    由于寮国战斗部队的和解精神和争取协商的努力，今年三月九日，双方曾达成一项停止一切敌对行动的协议，王国政府曾“保证不许任何对寮国战斗部队的敌对行动——特别是军事进攻——重演”。可是，王国政府并未履行这一保证，而是扩大进攻，使军事冲突日益严重。六月七日，王国政府发言人又公开声称要对寮国战斗部队“采取军事措施”。现在，王国部队果然向寮国战斗部队发动了新的进攻，并在桑怒省周围集结大批军队，包括飞机和伞兵部队，准备采取更大规模的军事行动。
    王国政府在采取这些敌对行动的同时，为了掩饰自己违反日内瓦协议的行为，不断诬控寮国战斗部队进攻他们。但是这些诬控一再遭到了破产。大家知道，老挝国际监督和监察委员会在过去就曾经进行多次调查，结果证明老挝王国政府对寮国战斗部队的指责完全是捏造的。相反地，调查证实了王国政府方面向寮国战斗部队集结地区的乌怒、乌西等地，空投人员和物资，进攻寮国战斗部队和劫掠人民等等事实。
    和它对寮国战斗部队集结地区实行军事进攻的同时，王国政府还违反日内瓦协议的明文规定，在其他十个省实施恐怖政策，扼杀民主自由权利，对前抗战人员和爱国公民进行逮捕、杀戮和其他报复行为。
    老挝王国政府抛弃政治协商的方法，不惜继续和扩大敌对行动，是想用军事手段来解决问题，剥夺寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员参加全国共同生活、不受歧视的权利，这是和日内瓦协议的精神背道而驰的。
    为了实现祖国的民主统一，寮国战斗部队曾作了很大的努力来谋求政治解决。去年十一月四日，寮国战斗部队代表发表声明，承认老挝王国政府；并宣布：在原则上，丰沙里和桑怒两省的行政机构是在老挝王国政府的最高监督之下。接着寮国战斗部队又积极争取同王国政府进行谈判来解决政治问题。
    寮国战斗部队的这种努力得到老挝人民的支持，双方政治会议才在一月十八日开始举行。这次会议发表了联合声明，表明双方愿意“同时实行日内瓦停战协定，以便共同来巩固和平，给人民带来自由和民主，实现统一和达到国家独立”。声明还表示双方“将寻求一切可能的办法，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，以期取得圆满的结果”。但是，王国政府没有遵守这个联合声明，而固执地坚持它的不符合日内瓦协议的主张，不考虑寮国战斗部队的合理建议，并六次中断了政治会议，而且在上述联合声明发表后不几天就发动了军事进攻。
    在四月十九日到二十四日的政治会议上，双方曾同意建立一个政治协商委员会来执行日内瓦协议。但是，王国政府代表团坚持政治协商委员会应置于王国政府的控制之下，它将只讨论隔离双方在丰沙里和桑怒两省的武装部队问题和在丰沙里和桑怒两省建立王国政府机构的问题。这个建议显然是违反了双方平等协商的原则，并想不顾日内瓦协议的规定，强行分割和取消寮国战斗部队集结区。由于王国政府方面这种蛮横的态度，会议未能就协商委员会的职权和任务达成协议。
    这一次政治会议中断后，老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯竟声言，没有必要成立政治协商委员会，只要成立一个什么“归顺委员会”就够了。接着，王国政府开始采取片面行动，任命了桑怒和丰沙里两省的“省长”，在芒奔和磅怒设立了“省行政委员会”。同时，它还宣布要举行排斥寮国战斗部队参加的片面选举并积极进行这种所谓选举的准备，迄今仍不肯就安排选举问题同寮国战斗部队进行协商。老挝王国政府这些措施，都是严重地违反日内瓦协定的。
    由于老挝王国政府这一连串破坏日内瓦协议的行为，在停战后的老挝造成了严重的局势。
    必须指出，目前严重的老挝局势，是华盛顿一手造成的，它是同美国的干涉、挑拨和煽动分不开的。
    美国拼凑了东南亚侵略集团，硬把老挝、柬埔寨和南越划入它们的“保护”地区之内。同时策划组织泰国、老挝和柬埔寨的“湄公河集团”。为了破坏老挝停战的稳定，美国在去年十一月就在老挝设立了所谓“援外事务管理署”分署，调拨飞机和作战物资供给老挝王国政府用来进攻寮国战斗部队的集结区。接着，美国又策划同老挝签订军事援助协定，以便把老挝变为美国的军事基地，并把老挝进一步拉入军事集团。
    正是为了达到这个目的，美国竭力煽动老挝的军事冲突，阻挠老挝的政治解决。杜勒斯今年二月参加曼谷会议之后，就曾亲自跑到老挝去煽动扩大军事冲突。他在演说中，赤裸裸地唆使王国政府对寮国战斗部队进行“镇压”，“设法恢复”对寮国战斗部队集结区的“控制”，并说马尼拉条约将予支持。
    最近，美国一面发动强烈的宣传攻势，竭力歪曲老挝局势的真相，曲解日内瓦协议，污蔑寮国战斗部队；一面又拨给老挝王国政府一千二百万美元，支持它扩大向寮国战斗部队的军事进攻。“纽约时报”六月二十三日公开说：美国对老挝王国政府要“采取军事措施”的决心表示“欢迎”。
    最近美国召集的马尼拉条约组织军事会议，暴露了美国干涉老挝局势的阴谋。据法新社透露：会议“仔细地研究了老挝的局势”，并“通过了反对共产党的具体措施”，以进行“紧急状态的准备”。马尼剌条约理事会还专门就老挝问题举行会议，企图扩大老挝的军事冲突，制造紧张局势。
    美国这种违反日内瓦协议的干涉行为，是对老挝的民族利益与和平的利益的严重威胁。寮国战斗部队和老挝国际委员会都建议恢复政治协商会议。为了老挝的民族利益和和平的利益，老挝王国政府应该停止军事行动，真诚求得老挝的政治解决，以实现老挝的民主统一，巩固老挝的和平。
