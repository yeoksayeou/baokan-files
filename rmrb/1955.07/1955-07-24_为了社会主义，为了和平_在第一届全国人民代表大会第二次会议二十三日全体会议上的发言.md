    For Socialism, For Peace
    —Speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, July 23rd Plenary Meeting
    Song Qingling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    I fully agree with the reports of the four Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    At this congress, we will solemnly adopt the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. This is a plan for the Chinese people to build socialism through creative labor, a plan that concerns the happy life of our 600 million people and their descendants, and also a plan through which we will make significant contributions to world peace and human prosperity. The adoption of this plan will undoubtedly stir up a widespread surge of labor enthusiasm among our people, and I believe it will also receive the eager attention and welcome of peace-loving people in all countries.

    Before this congress, according to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I was very pleased to have the opportunity to inspect work in various places. In the past, I had seen the new industrial base in the Northeast. This time, I inspected the rural areas of Jiangnan, the textile industry in Shanghai, and social welfare undertakings. I met many workers, farmers, and cadres on the production and construction front and held many discussions with them. From them, I saw strength, confidence, the growth of our cause, and the guarantee of the victory of the Five-Year Plan. This inspection gave me a good opportunity to learn.

    In Shanghai, I inspected the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the joint state-private Rende Yarn Factory. A vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy is underway in the factories. This is a crucial issue in the construction of the Five-Year Plan, to tap the potential of existing industries and accumulate funds for national industrialization. In order to build a socialist society, the workers have expressed their desire to consciously practice economy, and great achievements can be made in this regard. In terms of saving cotton, the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory used 400 jin of cotton per piece of yarn in the first half of 1954, which has now been reduced to 382 jin; in terms of saving electricity, the workers have put forward 94 suggestions, saving 130,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first quarter of this year. Workers in the cloth factory said, "Every piece of substandard cloth produced means a loss of 2.5 yuan to the country, so substandard cloth must not be produced." This shows the working class's highly conscious sense of ownership in national construction.

    A point to note in carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement is to prevent a mentality of being satisfied with existing achievements. There are still many wastes that should be overcome and potentials that can be tapped. According to Director Huang of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the large management structure is a major waste. Management personnel account for 13 percent of the factory's employees, and many are busy with reports. One workshop alone has 74 types of reports, and not all of these reports are necessarily read. If the reports from the wage department are reduced, the number of staff can be reduced from ten to five. A full factory adjustment could reduce the staff by one hundred. This shows that we still have a lot of surplus manpower that can be saved to support national construction.

    In rural areas, in Songjiang Special District of Jiangsu Province, I inspected the "Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative" led by Chen Yongkang, a national model for high rice yield, and the neighboring "Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative." I saw that the party's general line had penetrated deeply into the countryside, and the face of the countryside had undergone and continued to undergo profound changes. The peasants have a deep understanding of the dead end of the small-peasant economy and the necessity of organizing to gradually realize socialist transformation. Farmers recall the hardship of small-peasant economy, there are "Ten Worries", that is: worry about eating, worry about clothing, worry about use, worry about fertilizer, worry about not hiring workers, worry about rent rice, worry about debt avoidance, worry about sickness, worry about death, worry about rising prices. But now it is completely different, after liberation, organizing production, it has "Ten Good", that is: good production, good loans, good mutual aid groups, no usury, no bandits, do not avoid rent rice, stable prices, good cooperative, good clothing, good to socialism. The peasants have already seen the beautiful prospect of socialism. They say: individual work is not as good as mutual assistance, mutual assistance is not as good as cooperation. They have actively participated in agricultural production cooperatives.

    Two issues that should be emphasized in rural areas are the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the strengthening of education on the worker-peasant alliance. The general reaction of farmers to the unified purchase and sale is good. This spring, the grain supply in some rural areas once became tense, and rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to stir up trouble in an attempt to create chaos; but after the facts were clarified, the farmers' emotions stabilized. The farmers are most impressed by the stable prices. They said, "In the past, the price of rice changed six times a day, but after liberation, the price changed only once every six years." They realized that after the state controlled the grain, it stabilized prices, which was beneficial to the farmers themselves and to national industrialization. After the implementation of the "three fix" policy, production had a target, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production was further enhanced.

    The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of building socialism, and farmers have further recognized this point. Chen Yongkang of the Lianmin Cooperative said: "Before the general line was put forward, seeing that the workers' lives were good, young farmers also wanted to be workers and were not at ease with agricultural production. Through the publicity of the general line, everyone understood that industry must be developed, and agriculture is also important; if everyone goes to the factory, what will the workers eat if agriculture does not develop? If industry develops, water pumps will come, fertilizer will also be cheap, and there will be tractors in the future, so agriculture must support industry, and the workers and peasants must form a solid alliance to build socialism." We should strengthen this propaganda and education, because currently, there are some people at home and abroad who do not want China to build socialism and are sowing discord in our worker-peasant relations in an attempt to undermine our worker-peasant alliance. They say, "The peasants are too poor." Some people abroad also say that China's industrialization is "at the expense of agriculture and the needs of the people." The intention of those who say this is to prevent China from implementing socialist industrialization and to keep Chinese peasants forever in the poor and backward state of the small-peasant economy. However, history will not go backwards, and the plans of these people will never succeed.

    Since liberation, the lives of Chinese workers and peasants have improved in many ways. We are engaged in socialist construction to meet the material and cultural needs of the people. However, the improvement of people's lives must develop correspondingly with the progress of industrialization. During the period of large-scale industrialization in our country, we cannot use too much funds to improve welfare. We should distinguish between priorities on the basis of production development, and appropriately address the needs of the people according to the possible conditions. For example, it is said that an open-air dance hall is to be built in a certain workers' residential area in Shanghai, and the masses reacted that it was not needed. The workers said that it would be better to build a primary school, because there are still many workers' children who have not been enrolled in school. The opinions of the masses are completely correct. For another example, the workers of the joint state-private Rende Yarn Factory requested the construction of dormitories and schools, which is currently difficult to solve; but the workers requested the solution of the bathroom problem long ago, which should and can be done. I inspected four hospitals and health care undertakings in Shanghai and saw that our health and medical undertakings have made considerable progress in recent years; a problem that currently exists is that some medical staff do not have a good enough service attitude, and the masses have more opinions. This may be a common problem that should be first addressed and improved.

    Our cause is advancing. Our work is improving. We have countless new people growing up with our cause. I saw their faces during the inspection and left a clear impression. They are all vibrant and full of vitality. They are all humble and simple, diligently and conscientiously working step by step to complete the great historical feat of the Five-Year Plan with infinite love and loyalty to the cause of the people.

    Our Five-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful construction. It represents the Chinese people's long-term desire to establish a peaceful life. We will use the time of three five-year plans to change the backward economic face of our entire country. We will spend decades to cure the Yellow River, and transform this river, which once brought endless disasters to our ancestors, into an inexhaustible source of happiness for our descendants. In the first five-year plan alone, our total investment in economic construction and cultural construction will reach 76.64 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 700 million taels of gold. If we do not have the determination for long-term peaceful construction, can we do this?

    New China has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Together with other peace-loving countries, we have made unremitting and significant efforts to ease international tensions and have achieved some success. We welcome all efforts aimed at further easing the international situation. Currently, in Geneva, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France are holding their first meeting in ten years since the war. We welcome the convening of this meeting. We hope that the meeting will strive to find ways to restore mutual trust between major countries and create conditions for resolving all outstanding international issues. The heads of government of the four major countries will have to discuss the issues of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the easing of international tensions that are of concern to the people of the world at this meeting. The firm expressions and sincere efforts made by Soviet Chairman Bulganin to promote international peace and cooperation have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. U.S. President Eisenhower recently also stated that the United States believes in negotiation and friendly meetings, and he also expressed his willingness to "respond to a universal and urgent demand, which Prime Minister Bulganin acknowledged in his July 15 speech, that the political leaders of our great powers should find a path to peace." People are eagerly awaiting these words to become concrete actions, so that there may be good prospects for world peace. We hope this meeting will not disappoint the people of the world.

    The Chinese people are pursuing the great construction work of the Five-Year Plan with the firm belief that they will work for peace unswervingly. Every step of progress in our construction cause will increase the happiness of the people and will also increase world peace. This belief will always inspire us to strive for the victorious completion of our cause.

    为了社会主义，为了和平
    ——在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议二十三日全体会议上的发言
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长　宋庆龄
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    在这次大会上，我们要庄严地通过发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。这是中国人民用创造性的劳动来建设社会主义的计划，是关系着我国六亿人民和子孙后代的幸福生活的计划，也是我们将会对世界和平和人类繁荣作出重大贡献的计划。这个计划的通过，无疑地将在我们全国人民中间掀起普遍高涨的劳动热情，同时我相信也将受到世界各国爱好和平的人们的热切关注和欢迎。
    这次大会前，根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定，我很高兴有机会到各地视察工作。过去我曾经看过东北的新工业基地，这次我视察江南的农村和上海的纺织业以及社会福利事业。我见到了许多在生产建设战线上的工人、农民和干部，和他们举行了多次的座谈。我从他们身上看到了力量，看到了信心，看到了我们事业的成长，也看到了五年计划建设胜利的保证。这次视察给了我很好学习的机会。
    我在上海视察了国营上海第一棉纺厂和公私合营仁德纱厂。工厂中正热烈展开增产节约运动，这是五年计划建设中发挥现有工业潜在力量、为国家工业化积累资金的一个关键性的问题。工人为了建设社会主义社会，都表示要自觉地进行节约，在这方面是可以取得很大成就的。国棉一厂在节约用棉方面，一九五四年上半年每件纱用棉四百斤，现在减到了三百八十二斤；在节约用电方面，工人们提出了九十四条建议，今年第一季度就节约了十三万度电。布厂工人说：“出一个次布，国家就要损失二·五元，所以绝不能出次布”。这显出了工人阶级在国家建设中高度自觉的主人翁态度。
    增产节约运动展开中应注意的问题，是要防止满足于已有成绩的心理。应该克服的浪费和可以发掘的潜力，还是很多的。据国棉一厂黄厂长说，管理机构庞大是一个很大的浪费。管理人员占全厂职工百分之十三，很多人忙于表报，一个工场就有七十四种表报，而这些表报也不一定全看。如果把工资科的表报减少，职员就可以由十人减到五人，全厂调整一下可以减少一百人。这说明我们还有许多过剩的人力，可以节约下来支援全国的建设。
    农村方面，我在江苏省松江专区视察了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康所领导的“联民农业生产合作社”和邻近的“联盟农业生产合作社”。我看到党的总路线的教育已深入农村，农村的面貌已经而且继续在发生深刻的变化。农民对于小农经济的没有出路和必须组织起来逐步实现社会主义改造，有了深切的体会。农民们回忆小农经济的苦处，有“十忧”，即：忧吃、忧穿、忧用、忧肥料、忧请不到工、忧租米、忧避债、忧生病、忧死人、忧物价涨。可是现在完全不同了，解放后组织起来生产，就有了“十好”，即：生产好、贷款好、互助组好、无高利贷好、无土匪好、不要避租米好、物价稳定好、合作社好、穿的好、到社会主义好。农民已经望到了社会主义的美好远景，他们说：单干不如互助、互助不如合作。他们已经积极地参加了农业生产合作社。
    农村中应该重视的两个问题，是贯彻粮食统购统销政策和加强工农联盟教育。农民对于统购统销的一般反应是良好的。今春农村粮食供应在某些地方一度发生紧张，富农和反革命分子乘机起哄，企图造成混乱；但在弄清了事实之后，农民的情绪就稳定下来了。农民对于物价稳定的印象最深，他们说：“过去米一天六价，解放后六年一价”。他们认识到国家掌握了粮食之后，使物价保持平稳，对农民本身和国家工业化都有好处。实行“三定”政策以后，增产有了目标，农民的生产积极性就更加提高了。
    工农联盟是建设社会主义的基础，农民对这一点也已有了进一步的认识。联民社陈永康说：“总路线提出以前，看到工人生活好，青年农民也想当工人，不安心农业生产。通过总路线宣传，大家明白了工业要发展，农业也重要；如果大家到工厂去，农业不发展，工人吃啥呢？工业发展了，抽水机来了，肥田粉也便宜了，将来还有拖拉机，所以农业一定要支援工业，工农结成巩固联盟来建设社会主义。”我们应当加强这种宣传教育，因为目前国内外正有一些不愿意中国建设社会主义的人，在挑拨我们的工农关系，企图破坏我们的工农联盟。他们说：“农民太苦了”。国外也有人说：中国的工业化是“以农业和人民的需要为牺牲的。”说这种话的人的意思，是希望中国不实行社会主义工业化，要使中国农民永远停留在小农经济的贫困落后的状态。但是，历史不会走回头路，这些人的打算是绝对不会成功的。
    解放以来，中国工人和农民的生活在多方面都已有了改善。我们从事社会主义建设，就是为了满足人民物质生活和文化生活的需要。但是，人民生活的改善必须跟着工业化的进展而相应地发展。我们国家在大规模进行工业化的期间，还不能把太多资金用在改进生活福利方面。应该在生产发展的基础之上分清轻重缓急，根据可能的条件，来适当地解决人民的需要。例如，听说上海某工人住宅区要造一个露天舞厅，群众反应认为不需要，工人们说，不如造一个小学校，因为现在还有不少工人的孩子没有入学。群众的意见是完全正确的。又如，公私合营仁德纱厂工人要求造宿舍和学校，目前要解决还有困难；但是工人很早就要求解决浴室的问题，这是应该而且可以办到的。我在上海视察了四个医院和保健事业，看到几年来我们的卫生医疗事业是有了相当大的发展；目前存在着的一个问题，是有些医务工作人员服务态度不够好，群众意见比较多，这可能是带有普遍性的问题，应当首先注意加以改善。
    我们的事业在前进。我们的工作在改进。我们有无数新的人在跟着我们的事业而成长起来。我在视察中看到了他们的面貌，留下了鲜明的印象。他们都是朝气蓬勃，充满着生命力的。他们都是谦虚朴素地，勤勤恳恳地，抱着对于人民事业的无限热爱和忠诚，在一步一步地为完成五年计划的伟大历史创举而工作着。
    我们的五年计划是和平建设的计划，它集中地表示着中国人民对于建立和平生活的长久愿望。我们要用三个五年计划的时间，来改变我们整个国家的经济落后的面貌。我们要用几十年的时间，来根治黄河，把这条曾经带给我们祖先无穷灾患的河流，改造成为我们子孙后代无限幸福的泉源。仅在第一个五年计划内，我们对经济建设和文化建设投资的总数，就达七百六十六亿四千万元，折合黄金七万万两以上。如果我们没有长期和平建设的决心，我们能够这样做吗？
    新中国一贯执行着和平外交政策。我们和其他爱好和平的国家一道，对缓和国际紧张局势作了不懈的重大努力，并已取得一些成就。我们欢迎一切旨在促使国际局势进一步缓和的努力。目前在日内瓦，在举行着苏、美、英、法四大国政府首脑在战后十年来的第一次集会。我们欢迎这个会议的召开。我们希望会议努力寻取恢复大国之间相互信任的办法，为解决一切悬而未决的国际问题创造条件。四大国政府首脑在这次会议中将不能不讨论到全世界人民所关心的裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及缓和国际紧张局势的问题。苏联布尔加宁主席为了增进国际和平合作而作的坚定表示和真诚努力，已得到全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎。美国艾森豪威尔总统最近也表示，美国相信谈判，相信友好的会议，他也表示愿意“响应一个普遍的迫切的要求，这是布尔加宁总理在他的七月十五日的演说里所承认了的，即我们大国的政治领袖们要找出一条通向和平的道路”。人们正迫切地期待这种言论成为具体的行动，这样世界和平才有可能出现良好的前景。我们希望这次会议不要使世界人民失望。
    中国人民在从事伟大的五年计划建设工作的时候，是抱着坚定不渝地为和平而努力的信念的。我们建设事业的每一步进展，都将增进人民的幸福，也将增进世界的和平。这种信念将始终鼓舞着我们，来争取我们事业的胜利完成。
