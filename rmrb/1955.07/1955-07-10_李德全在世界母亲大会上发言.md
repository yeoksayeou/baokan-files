Xinhua News Agency, Lausanne, July 9th: Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation attending the World Congress of Mothers, spoke at the morning session on August 8th, on the topic of "Creating a Peaceful and Tranquil Environment for Children."

Li Dequan said: The mothers and women of China warmly welcome the convening of the congress, and have sent us to the beautiful city of Lausanne to discuss with everyone the common problem that plagues the hearts of hundreds of millions of mothers, which is how to protect our children. We thank Mrs. Eugénie Cotton for her report to the congress, "We Gave Birth to Life, We Must Protect Life." Her beautiful and moving report expressed the kind maternal love and sincere wishes of mothers. The Chinese delegation fully agrees with this report.

We are all mothers, and we all possess the noblest human emotion – great maternal love. We conceive children, raise children, educate children, from infancy to adulthood, from innocent childhood to becoming useful talents for the country, the nation, and all of humanity. When someone attempts to destroy and kill children, we never avoid any difficulties or spare any sacrifices in order to protect them.

We Chinese mothers and women deeply understand the source of pain and happiness from our own personal experiences. In those years of war, we suffered deeply from the foreign invaders. Tens of millions of mothers lost the children they had raised with their own hands. The blood of children and the tears of mothers flowed into rivers, which is why we hate war and oppose colonialism.

War has also brought tremendous pain to mothers all over the world. The Second World War took the lives of tens of millions of children from their mothers' sides. Those who were slaughtered and tortured in the concentration camps of Birkenau and Auschwitz were all beloved children of our mothers. The unspeakable disasters suffered by mothers and children in Korea and Vietnam during the war are still vivid in our minds. We will absolutely never forget the atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters suffered by Japanese mothers and children.

Li Dequan then described the happy lives of children in New China and the beneficial work done by the government and the people for mothers and children. She said: Our country, like other countries in Asia and those that have suffered from colonialist aggression, has not completely eliminated the backwardness of its national economy and cultural undertakings, which still has a certain impact on the lives of our mothers and children. Therefore, we are striving to create an international environment of peace, continue to carry out peaceful construction, eliminate backwardness, and create a better future for our children. This is an important reason why Chinese women and mothers love peace.

Li Dequan pointed out that in recent months, new hope has emerged for the cause of peace, but there are still many obstacles on the road to achieving lasting world peace. The danger of a new war still seriously threatens mothers and children. She said: Faced with this situation, mothers all over the world must unite more closely to protect children from war, strive for disarmament, and promote friendship between the people of all countries. Chinese mothers and women guarantee their full support for and active participation in this noble and just action.

Li Dequan said: In order to defend peace and protect children, it is necessary to greatly strengthen understanding and friendship between the people of all countries. We welcome more friends to visit our country. We firmly believe that mothers of all countries are friendly, and that everyone is connected in heart and mind, sharing joys and sorrows. Eastern mothers and Western mothers, Chinese mothers and American mothers, are all equally friendly, and artificial barriers can be completely eliminated.

In order to defend peace and protect children, it is necessary to oppose war, strive for universal disarmament, oppose the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, and use atomic energy for peaceful purposes to eliminate the threat of a new war. The Chinese people and mothers have already demonstrated this strong will for peace with their own practical actions. Four hundred and five million, five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven Chinese people signed the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world. The number of Chinese mothers and women who signed the appeal accounts for about half of the total number of signatures.

Li Dequan concluded: The will of mothers is strong, the power of unity is invincible, and world peace is indivisible. Let us Eastern and Western mothers unite closely to protect children and defend peace. As long as women and mothers unite, they will mobilize the vast majority of the people to defend peace, and there will be the power to stop war, and no one will dare to launch a war. As long as we unite and bring into play the great power of mothers, we will be able to protect life and benefit mankind. Let us all bravely shoulder the task of defending world peace, as if it were the sacred duty of raising children! Long live world peace.

　　李德全在世界母亲大会上发言
    新华社洛桑九日电　出席世界母亲大会的中国代表团团长李德全在八日上午会议上发言，题目是“为孩子们创造和平宁静的环境”。
    李德全说：我们中国的母亲和妇女热烈欢迎大会的召开，派遣我们来到美丽的洛桑城，和大家一起商讨萦绕在亿万母亲心头的共同问题，就是怎样来保卫我们的孩子。感谢欧仁妮·戈登夫人给大会作了“我们孕育了生命，我们要保卫生命”的报告，她这美丽而动人的报告，表达了母亲们慈祥的母爱和衷心的愿望。中国代表团完全同意这个报告。
    我们大家都是母亲，都具有人类崇高的感情——伟大的母爱。我们孕育了孩子，抚养了孩子，教育了孩子，从婴儿直到成年，从天真无邪的童年直到成为对国家、对民族、对全人类有用的人材。当有人企图摧残和杀害孩子的时候，我们为了保卫孩子，从来不避任何艰难，不惜任何牺牲。
    我们中国的母亲和妇女们，从自己的亲身经历中，深深地懂得痛苦和幸福的来源。在那战争的年代里，我们受尽了外国侵略者带给我们的深重苦难。成千万的母亲丧失了亲手抚养成人的子女。孩子们的鲜血和母亲们的眼泪交流成渠，这就是我们为什么憎恨战争，为什么反对殖民主义者的原因。
    战争同样给全世界的母亲们带来了深巨创痛。第二次世界大战从母亲们的身边夺去了几千万子女的生命。在柏德奈克和奥斯威辛集中营里遭受屠杀和折磨的，都是我们母亲们心爱的儿女。朝鲜和越南的母亲和孩子们在战争中遭受的惨绝人寰的灾难，还历历在目。日本的母亲和儿童遭受的原子弹和氢弹的灾害，更是我们绝对不会忘记的。
    李德全接着叙说了新中国的儿童的幸福生活以及政府和人民替母亲和孩子做了许多有益的工作。她说：我们的国家也和亚洲及其他遭受殖民主义者侵略的国家一样，国民经济和文化事业的落后现象还没有完全消除，在我们母亲和儿童的生活中还有一定影响。因此，我们竭力要争取国际和平环境，继续进行和平建设，消除落后现象，为孩子们创造更美好的将来。这就是我们中国妇女和母亲热爱和平的一个重要原因。
    李德全指出，最近几个月来，和平事业出现了新的希望，但是，在争取世界持久和平的道路上，还有着重重的阻碍。新战争危险依旧严重地威胁着母亲和孩子。她说：面对着这样的情况，全世界的母亲只有更加亲密地团结起来，保卫孩子反对战争，争取裁减军备，增进各国人民间的友谊。中国的母亲和妇女保证完全支持和积极参加这种崇高的正义的行动。
    李德全说：为了保卫和平，保卫孩子，就必须大大加强各国人民间的了解和友谊。我们欢迎更多的朋友到我国访问参观。我们深信各国母亲是友好的，大家是声息相通、苦乐相共的。东方母亲和西方母亲，中国母亲和美国母亲，同样都是友好的，人为的隔阂是完全可以消除的。
    为着保卫和平，保卫孩子，必须反对战争，争取普遍裁减军备，反对制造和使用原子武器，把原子能用于和平目的以消除新战争的威胁。中国人民和母亲已经用自己的实际行动表明了这种坚强的和平意志。中国人民在世界和平理事会常务委员会告全世界人民书上签名的达四亿零五十万五千九百九十七人。中国母亲和妇女签名的人数约占签名总人数的一半左右。
    李德全最后说：母亲的意志是强大的，团结的力量是无敌的，全世界的和平是不可分割的。让我们东方和西方的母亲亲密地团结起来，保卫孩子，保卫和平。只要妇女和母亲们团结一致，就动员了最大多数的人民来保卫和平，就有力量制止战争，就没有人敢于发动战争。只要团结和发挥母亲们的伟大的力量，我们就能够保卫生命，就能够为人类造福。让我们大家把保卫世界和平的事业，当作抚育孩子的神圣职责一样，勇敢地担负起来吧！世界和平万岁。
