After reviewing the 1954 national final accounts and the 1955 national budget, the Budget Committee completed the review report on the 1954 national final accounts and the 1955 national budget at today's meeting. The Bills Committee, at its enlarged meeting held today, reviewed the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China and completed the review report on the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China.
    Prior to this, the Proposals Examination Committee of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress held meetings on the 25th and 26th to discuss the grouped review opinions on the proposals and completed the report on the examination of the proposals.
    All three review reports mentioned above will be submitted to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 28th—The delegate groups of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress concluded their discussions on the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China on the 27th.
    During the discussions, the delegates unanimously supported the draft law and the report by Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai. They said that the Military Service Law is a manifestation of the common aspiration and strong will of the Chinese people to defend the security of the motherland, safeguard our socialist construction, liberate our territory of Taiwan, and defend world peace. In the pilot work of conscripting and replenishing soldiers in accordance with the principle of compulsory military service, more than ten million young people across the country signed up for enlistment, which fully reflects this aspiration.
    The delegates said that the implementation of the Military Service Law means realizing the sacred principle stipulated in the Constitution that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to perform military service. The implementation of the Military Service Law will be a major reform in our country's military system. This reform will not only benefit national construction but also establish a solid reserve force for national defense.
    Delegates from coastal and border areas all believed that the implementation of the Military Service Law will have a significant effect on consolidating the national defense and borders of the motherland.
    Many delegates stated that after returning, they will work together with representatives of the people's congresses at all levels to vigorously carry out propaganda work among the people and assist in the implementation of the Military Service Law.
    During the discussion of the Draft Military Service Law, the State Council sent responsible staff to the meeting to answer inquiries, and they provided explanations to the various questions raised by the delegates.

    全国人民代表大会预算、法案等委员会
    完成预决算等三个审查报告
    各代表小组结束对兵役法草案的讨论
    新华社二十八日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会和法案委员会二十八日上午分别举行会议。预算委员会对一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算进行了审查以后，在今天举行的会议上完成了关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的审查报告。法案委员会在今天举行的扩大会议上，审查了中华人民共和国兵役法草案，并完成了关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的审查报告。
    在此以前，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案审查委员会先后在二十五日、二十六日举行会议，讨论了对提案的分组审查意见，完成了关于提案审查的报告。
    以上三个审查报告，都将向第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提出。
    新华社二十八日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议各代表小组讨论中华人民共和国兵役法草案，到二十七日已先后结束。
    代表们在讨论时，一致拥护这个法案和彭德怀副总理兼国防部长的报告。他们说，兵役法是我国人民保卫祖国安全、保卫我国社会主义建设、解放我国领土台湾、保卫世界和平的共同愿望和坚强意志的表现。在按义务兵役制原则试行征集补充兵员的工作中，全国青年报名应征的有一千多万人，这个事实充分地反映了这一愿望。
    代表们说，实施兵役法，就是实现了宪法所规定的中华人民共和国公民有服兵役义务的神圣原则。兵役法的实施，将是我国军事制度上的重大改革。这种改革，既有利于国家建设，又能为国防建立起雄厚的后备力量。
    从沿海和边疆地区来的代表们都认为，兵役法实施后，对巩固祖国的国防和边疆，将有重大的作用。
    许多代表表示，他们回去后，将和地方各级人民代表大会代表一起，在人民群众中大力进行宣传工作，协助兵役法的实施。
    在讨论兵役法草案时，国务院派出了负责工作人员到会接受咨询，他们对代表们提出的各种问题都作了解释。
