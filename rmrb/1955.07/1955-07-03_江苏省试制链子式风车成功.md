Jiangsu Province Successfully Trials Chain-Type Windmill

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, based on the old roller-type windmill, has successfully trial-produced a chain-type windmill. This chain-type windmill uses chain transmission, which is more solid and reduces power loss than the roller-type windmill. It uses twelve to eighteen multi-blade wind canopies made of bamboo strips, which are not only more durable and flexible than cloth canopies, but also do not catch the wind easily and are not prone to generating eddies. Compared with the old-fashioned six-blade cloth canopy windmill, the wind-receiving area is increased by 50%, and it can still operate under low wind conditions. In particular, the chain-type windmill is equipped with a balanced sliding wheel and a balanced weight hammer, which can automatically adjust the speed and stop according to the increase or decrease of wind force, making it convenient and safe to use. Because the chain-type windmill uses bamboo frames and bamboo strip canopies, it can save a large amount of cotton cloth, wood, and labor compared with ordinary old-fashioned windmills, and the price is also much cheaper than ordinary windmills. This kind of windmill can irrigate 30 to 50 mu of land a day, so it is generally welcomed by the masses. Kunshan County has decided to promote 200 such windmills in the large-scale increase in production. (Our reporter stationed in Nanjing)

　  江苏省试制链子式风车成功
    江苏省农林厅根据旧有滚筒式风车研究改造，试制成功了一种链子式风车。这种链子式风车因采用链条传动，比滚筒式风车既牢固又减少动力损耗。它采用篾篷十二到十八片的多叶风篷，不但比布篷耐久，移动灵活，而且可以不兜风，不易产生涡流，比旧式六叶布篷风车增加受风面积百分之五十，在低级风力下仍能运转。特别是链子式风车，装置了平衡滑动轮和平衡重锤，能够随着风力的增减，自动调速及停车，使用方便而又安全。由于链子式风车用的竹架、篾篷，比一般旧式风车可节省大批棉布、木材和人工，价格也比一般风车便宜很多。这种风车一天可以灌溉三十到五十亩土地，因此，受到群众普遍欢迎。昆山县已决定在大面积增产中推广二百架这种风车。　（本报驻南京记者）
