Gradually and Separately Incorporating Various Non-Socialist Economic Components into the National Plan
Xue Muqiao

The "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" of our country, which will soon be decided by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, was formulated under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, based on the general task of the state during the transition period as stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Constitution stipulates that "the general task of the state during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." The basic task of the First Five-Year Plan is to lay a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization, to lay a preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and to lay a foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. It is a major step in realizing the state's general task during the transition period.

The transition period is a period in which multiple economic components coexist, that is, on the one hand, there is the socialist state-owned economy, and on the other hand, there are small commodity economy and capitalist economy. The socialist economy and the capitalist economy are two mutually opposed economies. The socialist economy requires the planned and proportionate development of the national economy, while the capitalist economy requires free competition and blind development. The planned nature of the socialist economy and the blindness of the capitalist economy are obviously contradictory. Whether to allow the planned nature of the socialist economy to increasingly restrict the blindness of the capitalist economy, or to allow the blindness of the capitalist economy to undermine the planned nature of the socialist economy, are two different results that may arise in the development of the contradiction. Therefore, we are faced with the question of whether we can incorporate various non-socialist economic components into the national plan, and how to gradually and separately incorporate them into the national plan. This is a problem that we must properly solve in our practical work.

First of all, we must ask, is it possible to incorporate various non-socialist economic components into the national plan? Some people believe that the capitalist economy is governed by the laws of competition and anarchy of production. The small commodity economy is also the same to a certain extent. Therefore, it is impossible to incorporate them into the national plan. They can only be blindly regulated by the law of value. We believe that this idea has some basis, but they only see one aspect of the problem and not the other. Of course, for capitalist countries, their idea is correct; but in people's democratic countries, where the proletariat has grasped political power and the important economic lifeline of the country, and thus a socialist economy of the whole people has emerged, their idea is obviously incomplete and therefore wrong. Our country's experience in the past few years has fully proved that under the existing political and economic conditions in our country, with the growth of socialist economic components, the scope of the economic laws of competition and anarchy of production has been increasingly restricted, and the state has been able to gradually and separately incorporate various non-socialist economies into the national plan.

As early as the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we established the leading position of the working class in politics, and gradually established the leading position of the socialist state-owned economy in the national economy. In the past few years, due to the increasing strength of the socialist state-owned economy and the increasing consolidation of its leading position in the national economy, the socialist economic laws not only dominate the socialist economy, but also can influence other economic components to a certain extent. With the gradual socialist transformation of various non-socialist economies by the state, the role of socialist economic laws will gradually expand and gradually strengthen. This is the theoretical basis for our country to use economic plans to guide the development and transformation of the national economy.

In practical terms, the national economy is a unified and organic whole. If only the socialist economy develops according to the national plan, while the non-socialist economy is completely unrestricted by the national plan and can still develop blindly, the result will inevitably disrupt the national plan completely. This would be sacrificing the interests of the working people of the whole country for the benefit of a few people in the bourgeoisie, and jeopardizing our country's bright future of building a socialist society, which of course we cannot allow. In order to build socialism, in order to strengthen the planned nature of the national economy and restrict the blindness of the capitalist economy, in the past few years, the state has gradually grasped the important economic lifeline, grasped the production and market circulation process of many kinds of important materials (from raw materials to products), and made overall arrangements for various economic components. Under the management of the state, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, the economic activities of private industry and commerce cannot but be constrained by the national plan to a certain extent.

Of course, we must also oppose another wrong idea, that is, denying that the law of value still plays a certain role in our country, especially the regulatory role it plays in the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy, thus treating the socialist economy and the non-socialist economy in the same way. It should be recognized that the state's plan for the state-owned economy and the plan for the private economy are completely different in nature. The plan for the state-owned economy is a direct plan, requiring all state-owned enterprises to act completely in accordance with the national plan and ensure the completion of various tasks stipulated in the national plan. The plan for the private economy is an indirect plan. The state cannot directly prescribe various production tasks for private enterprises. It must be good at using the law of value and use various policies such as prices, taxes, and credit to influence the private economy, so that they meet the requirements of the national plan to a certain extent. Both the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy are governed by the law of value, and the capitalist economy is also governed by the law of surplus value. Therefore, correctly grasping the price policy, using the price policy to regulate the labor remuneration obtained by small commodity producers, and adjusting the profits obtained by capitalists, so as to guide them to develop in the direction required by the state, is a problem that planning workers should pay special attention to during the transition period. If we deny that the law of value still plays a regulatory role in the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy, and believe that our national plan can disregard the law of value and unlimitedly dominate these non-socialist economic components, this is obviously wrong.

In short, the entire transition period is a process of continuous struggle and victory between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy. Through complex and sharp struggles, the role of socialist economic laws is constantly expanding and strengthening, while the scope of the role of the law of value, especially the law of surplus value, is constantly shrinking; finally, socialist economic laws occupy a dominant position in the entire national economy, and the law of value only plays a role within a certain range. Negating the influence of socialist economic laws on the individual economy and the capitalist economy, and negating the possibility of the state using the law of value and using the law of value to gradually incorporate the individual economy and the capitalist economy into the national plan, is right-leaning opportunism that surrenders to capitalism. Conversely, if we fail to see that the law of value still plays a considerable role in the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy, and fail to see that the national plan must pass through the law of value in order to control and guide the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy, then we will draw a "left" leaning adventurous conclusion.

In order to gradually and separately incorporate various economic components into the national plan, so as to strengthen the planned nature of the national economy and overcome its blindness, our country has taken various measures in the past few years and has achieved many successful experiences. The experience of several years has proved that gradually carrying out socialist transformation of various non-socialist economic components (such as making agriculture and handicrafts cooperative, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism) can gradually incorporate these economic components into the national plan. The planning of the national economy originally had contradictions with the small commodity economy and the capitalist economy. The national plan can only give a certain degree of influence to these non-socialist economic components; only when these non-socialist economic components have been gradually added to socialist factors can the national plan gradually exert a greater regulatory role on them. Therefore, our process of gradually carrying out socialist transformation of the non-socialist economy is also the process of gradually incorporating them into the national plan. At present, although our national plan has begun to play a regulatory and guiding role in the development of the national economy, this role is still subject to a certain degree of restriction; only when our socialist transformation cause is basically completed can our national economy be completely planned.

Looking back at the period of national economic recovery, in addition to vigorously developing the socialist state-owned economy and gradually strengthening its leading position in the national economy, we also carried out socialist transformation work on various non-socialist economic components. For example, in the industrial sector, in addition to carrying out joint state-private operation of some private industries, we also widely carried out processing and ordering work. Some important industries in the private industry sector have mostly accepted the state's processing and ordering. The state can control and guide the production activities of certain important industries in the private industry sector to a certain extent through the processing and ordering plan. In the commercial sector, the state has controlled foreign trade, grasped the main part of domestic wholesale trade, and the retail sales of socialist enterprises also account for a considerable proportion in retail trade, and it also controls the market prices of many important commodities, thus making most of the activities of private commerce subject to a certain degree of restriction. In the agricultural sector, in addition to starting to develop various mutual aid and cooperative organizations, rural supply and marketing cooperatives have also been widely developed. The state has grasped the sales market of important agricultural products such as grain and cotton, and it has been possible to influence agricultural production through the organization of cooperatives and through correct price policies. These achievements have created favorable conditions for implementing national economic planning and implementing planned socialist economic construction.

In 1953, our country began to implement the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. It was unprecedented in Chinese history to use plans to guide the activities of all aspects of the national economy. In order to further exert the regulatory and guiding role of the national plan on various economic components, the state is continuing to strengthen the leading position of the socialist state-owned economy and continue to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. In addition to continuing to expand the scope of processing and ordering and purchasing, the state has also implemented planned purchase of grain, oil, cotton, and cotton cloth, and planned supply of grain, cotton cloth, and edible oil, further undertaking the task of allocating important raw materials and arranging the market for important products. These measures have played a very important role in strengthening the planning of the national economy.

In the past two years, the regulatory role of the national plan on industrial production has continued to expand. This is not only because the proportion of state-owned industry and joint state-private industry is constantly expanding, but also because the scope of processing and ordering is also continuing to expand. By 1954, the value of products processed, ordered, purchased, and marketed by the state from private large-scale industries accounted for 89 percent of the total output value of private large-scale industries. It is expected that by the time the First Five-Year Plan is completed, most of the private industries will be transformed into various forms of state capitalist economy, and most of the private modern industries will be transformed into advanced forms of state capitalist economy, that is, joint state-private industry. In addition to continuing to strengthen the planned management of state-owned industry and joint state-private industry, the state should also continue to strengthen the processing and ordering plan for private industry, make comprehensive arrangements for industries of various economic components in accordance with the policy of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, continue to give play to the production enthusiasm of private industry, and restrict its blindness and destructiveness.

The influence of the national plan on commodity circulation is also continuing to strengthen. In 1954, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises have grasped 89 percent of the pure commercial wholesale volume and 67 percent of the pure commercial retail volume. Some private commercial enterprises (including capitalist commercial enterprises and small vendors) have begun to become sales agents and distributors of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. It is expected that by the time the First Five-Year Plan is completed, most of the private wholesalers will be replaced by state-owned commercial enterprises, and more than half of the private retailers will accept the task of sales agency and distribution, becoming commercial enterprises of state capitalist nature or cooperative nature. In addition to continuing to strengthen the planned management of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises, the state should also continue to strengthen the wholesale plan for private commercial enterprises, so that private commercial enterprises can continue to play a beneficial role in urban and rural exchanges, especially in the supply of people's daily necessities, under the leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, and restrict their speculative activities and destructive effects.

The national plan is also expanding its influence on agricultural production. This is not only due to the significant development of agricultural production cooperatives in the past two years, but more importantly, the state has implemented the policy of planned purchase of grain, cotton, and oil, etc., and has continued to expand the scope of purchase of other agricultural products. The policy of planned purchase and planned supply restricts the spontaneity of farmers and effectively incorporates agricultural production into the national plan step by step. Of course, because agricultural production is particularly scattered, and under the current technical conditions, we cannot completely resist the attack of natural disasters, the national plan for agriculture can only be an indirect plan with estimates; the state must continue to promote agricultural cooperation, continue to strengthen the work of planned purchase and planned supply, and strengthen the pre-purchase work of important agricultural products such as cotton. Under the condition of ensuring the completion of the state's purchase tasks, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and develop the enthusiasm of farmers in production.

The state should also pay full attention to the small commodity production of handicrafts, organize them to participate in various forms of cooperatives, and make overall arrangements within the local scope. For handicrafts for export and handicrafts sold throughout the country, national balances should also be tried to gradually incorporate them into the national plan.

The experience of several years has proved that under the current circumstances in our country, it is not only necessary but also possible to use a unified national plan to guide the development and transformation of the national economy. The rapid progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation in the past few years not only requires us to gradually and separately incorporate various non-socialist economic components into the national plan, but has also created the necessary conditions for gradually incorporating these economic components into the national plan. Of course, in our country, where the economy is still relatively backward, the small-scale peasant economy still dominates, and the capitalist economy still occupies a relatively important position, it is also difficult to implement comprehensive planned management of the national economy, and it can only gradually advance with the development of socialist transformation work. For various non-socialist economic components, it is still necessary to be good at using the law of value, correctly implement various policies of our Party, and strengthen its planned nature and overcome its blindness through processing and ordering plans, wholesale plans, planned purchase and planned supply, and other various measures. Planning workers must also strengthen investigation and research, and strengthen the study of economic theory and economic policy. Only in this way can we gradually improve the level of planning work and further strengthen the regulatory and guiding role of the national plan on the development of the national economy.

    把各种非社会主义的经济成份逐步地、分别地纳入国家计划轨道
    薛暮桥
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议即将决定的我国“发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”，是在中共中央和毛主席的直接领导下，根据中华人民共和国宪法所规定的国家在过渡时期的总任务而制定的。宪法规定“国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造”。而第一个五年计划的基本任务，则是要为我国的社会主义工业化打下初步基础，为对农业、手工业的社会主义改造打下初步基础，为对私营工商业的社会主义改造打下基础，它是实现国家在过渡时期总任务的一个重大步骤。
    过渡时期是有多种经济成份同时存在的时期，即一方面存在着社会主义性质的国营经济，另一方面又存在着小商品经济和资本主义经济。社会主义经济同资本主义经济是两种互相对立的经济，社会主义经济要求国民经济有计划、按比例地发展，而资本主义经济则要求自由竞争，盲目发展，社会主义经济的计划性同资本主义经济的盲目性，显然是互相矛盾的。究竟让社会主义经济的计划性来日益限制资本主义经济的盲目性，还是让资本主义经济的盲目性来破坏社会主义经济的计划性，这是在矛盾的发展中可能产生的两种不同的结果。因此在我们的面前便摆着这样一个问题，究竟我们能不能把各种非社会主义的经济成份纳入国家计划，以及如何把它们逐步地、分别地纳入国家计划，这是我们在实际工作中必须妥善地来解决的问题。
    首先我们要问，究竟能不能把各种非社会主义的经济成份纳入国家计划？有人认为：资本主义经济是受竞争和生产的无政府状态的规律所支配的。小商品经济在一定的程度上也是如此，因此不可能把它们纳入国家计划，它们只能盲目地受价值规律调节。我们认为：这种想法固然也有部分理由，但他们只看到问题的这一方面，而没有看到问题的另一方面。当然，对于资本主义国家来说，他们这样的想法是正确的；但在人民民主国家，在无产阶级已经掌握政权，掌握着国家的重要经济命脉，因而已经出现了全民所有制的社会主义经济的条件下，他们这样的想法便显然是不完全的，因而是错误的。我国几年来的经验已经充分证明：在我国现存的政治和经济条件下，随着社会主义经济成份的增长，竞争和生产无政府状态的经济规律发生作用的范围已经日益受到限制，国家已有可能把各种非社会主义经济逐步地、分别地纳入国家计划。
    早在中华人民共和国成立之初，我们就确立了工人阶级在政治上的领导地位，并逐步确立了社会主义国营经济在国民经济中的领导地位。几年来由于社会主义国营经济的日益壮大，以及它在国民经济中的领导地位日益巩固，社会主义的经济规律不但支配着社会主义经济，而且能够在一定的范围内和一定的程度上影响着其它各种经济成份。随着国家对各种非社会主义经济的逐步进行社会主义改造，社会主义经济规律所起的作用还会逐渐扩大，逐渐加强，这是我们国家得以用经济计划来指导国民经济的发展和改造的理论基础。
    再就实际方面来讲，国民经济是一个统一的有机的整体，如果只有社会主义经济按照国家计划发展，而非社会主义经济则完全不受国家计划限制，仍旧可以盲目发展，其结果必然会把国家计划完全打乱。这就是为资产阶级少数人的利益而牺牲全国劳动人民的利益，断送我国建成社会主义社会的光明前途，当然我们是不能允许的。为着建设社会主义，为着加强国民经济的计划性和限制资本主义经济的盲目性，几年来、国家已经逐步地掌握了重要的经济命脉，掌握了许多种重要物资（从原料到产品）的生产和市场流通过程，对各种经济成份进行统筹安排。私营工商业在国家管理、国营经济领导，和工人群众的监督下，它们的经济活动就不能不在一定的程度上受国家计划的约束。
    当然，我们也要反对另外一种错误的想法，即不承认价值规律在我国还发生一定的作用，特别是对小商品经济和资本主义经济所起的调节作用，因而把社会主义经济同非社会主义经济完全同样看待。应该认识，国家对国营经济的计划和对私营经济的计划，在性质上是完全不同的。对国营经济的计划是直接计划，要求所有的国营企业完全按照国家计划办事，保证完成国家计划所规定的各项任务。对私营经济的计划则是间接计划，国家不能直接为私营企业规定各项生产任务，必须善于利用价值规律，并通过价格、税收、信贷等各种政策，来影响私营经济，使它们在一定的程度上符合于国家计划的要求。小商品经济和资本主义经济都要受价值规律支配，其中资本主义经济还要受剩余价值规律支配，因此正确掌握价格政策，通过价格政策来调节小商品生产者所取得的劳动报酬，调整资本家所取得的利润，从而指导他们朝着国家所要求的方向发展，这是计划工作人员在过渡时期中特别应该注意的问题。如果我们否认价值规律对小商品经济和资本主义经济仍起调节作用，认为我们的国家计划可以不理会价值规律而无限制地支配这些非社会主义的经济成份，这显然也是错误的。
    总之，整个过渡时期，是社会主义经济同资本主义经济不断斗争和取得胜利的过程。经过复杂的、尖锐的斗争，社会主义经济规律所起的作用不断地扩大和加强，而价值规律特别是剩余价值规律所起的作用的范围则不断地缩小；最后社会主义经济规律在整个国民经济中占支配地位，价值规律仅仅在一定的范围内发生作用。否定社会主义经济规律对个体经济和资本主义经济的影响，否定国家有可能利用价值规律并通过价值规律来把个体经济和资本主义经济逐步纳入国家计划，这就是向资本主义投降的右倾机会主义。反之，如果看不到价值规律对小商品经济和资本主义经济仍起相当作用，看不到国家计划必须通过价值规律，才能控制并指导小商品经济和资本主义经济，那就会得出“左”倾冒进的结论。
              ×　　×　　×
    为了把各种经济成份逐步地、分别地纳入国家计划，以加强国民经济的计划性，克服其盲目性，我们国家几年来曾采取了各种措施，并已经取得了不少成功的经验。几年的经验证明，对各种非社会主义经济成份逐步地进行社会主义改造（如使农业和手工业合作化，使资本主义工商业转变为各种形式的国家资本主义），就能把这些经济成份逐步地纳入国家计划轨道。国民经济的计划化，同小商品经济和资本主义经济原来是有矛盾的，国家计划对这些非社会主义经济成份只能给以一定程度的影响；只有当这些非社会主义经济成份已经逐步地被加入了社会主义因素的时候，国家计划才能够对它们逐步发挥更大的调节作用。因此，我们对非社会主义经济逐步进行社会主义改造的过程，同时也就是把这些经济逐步纳入国家计划的过程。目前，我们的国家计划虽然已对国民经济的发展开始起调节和指导的作用，但是，这一作用还受着一定程度的限制；只有当我们的社会主义改造事业基本完成的时候，才可能使我们的国民经济完全计划化。
    回想在国民经济的恢复时期，我们除大力发展社会主义国营经济，逐步加强它在国民经济中的领导地位以外，还对各种非社会主义的经济成分进行了社会主义改造工作。如在工业方面，除对部分私营工业进行公私合营外，还广泛地开展了加工定货工作，私营工业中的一些重要行业，大部分已接受了国家的加工定货，国家可以通过加工定货计划，在一定的程度上控制和指导私营工业中某些重要行业的生产活动。在商业方面，国家已经管制对外贸易，掌握了国内批发贸易的主要部分，在零售贸易中，社会主义企业的零售额也占相当大的比重，并掌握着许多种重要商品的市场价格，因而使大部分私营商业的活动受到了一定程度的限制。在农业方面，除已开始发展各种互助合作组织外，农村供销合作社也已广泛发展，国家已经掌握了粮食、棉花等重要农产品的销售市场，已经有可能通过合作社的组织，通过正确的价格政策来影响农业生产。这些成就，为实行国民经济计划化，和实行有计划的社会主义经济建设创造了良好的条件。
      一九五三年，我国开始实行发展国民经济的第
  一个五年计划，用计划来指导国民经济的各方面的活动，在中国历史上是前所未有的。为着进一步发挥国家计划对各种经济成份的调节和指导作用，国家正继续加强社会主义国营经济的领导地位，继续推进对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作。国家除继续扩大加工定货和收购的范围外，并对粮食、油料、棉花、棉布实施了计划收购，和对粮食、棉布、食油实施了计划供应，进一步担负起重要原料的分配，和重要产品的市场安排的任务，这些措施，对加强国民经济的计划化发挥了十分重要的作用。
    两年来，国家计划对工业生产的调节作用正在继续扩大，这不但由于国营工业和公私合营工业所占比重不断扩大，而且由于加工定货的范围也在继续扩大。到一九五四年，国家对私营大型工业加工、定货、统购、包销和收购等产品的价值，已占私营大型工业总产值的百分之八十九。预计到第一个五年计划完成的时候，私营工业的大部分将要转变为各种形式的国家资本主义经济，而私营现代工业的大部分将要转变为高级形式的国家资本主义经济，即公私合营工业。国家除应继续加强对国营工业和公私合营工业的计划管理以外，还应当继续加强对私营工业的加工定货计划，根据统筹兼顾的政策，对各种经济成份的工业进行全面的安排，继续发挥私营工业的生产积极性，并限制其盲目性和破坏性。
    国家计划对商品流通的影响也在继续加强，一九五四年，国营商业和合作社商业已经掌握了纯商业批发额的百分之八十九，掌握了纯商业零售额的百分之六十七，有一部分私营商业（包括资本主义商业和小商贩）已经开始成为国营商业和供销合作社的代销商和经销商。预计到第一个五年计划完成的时候，大部分的私营批发商将要被国营商业所代替，而私营的零售商则将有半数以上接受代销、经销的任务，成为国家资本主义性质或合作社性质的商业。国家除应继续加强对国营商业和合作社商业的计划管理以外，还应当继续加强对私营商业的批发计划，使私营商业能够在国营商业和供销合作社的领导下，对城乡交流特别是人民日用品的供应继续起有益的作用，并限制其投机活动和破坏作用。
    国家计划对农业生产也在扩大其影响，这不仅由于农业生产合作社两年来有显著的发展，更重要的由于国家实施了对粮食、棉花和油料等的计划收购政策，并继续扩大了对其它农产品的收购范围。计划收购和计划供应政策限制了农民的自发性，有效地把农业生产逐步纳入国家计划。当然，由于农业生产特别分散，并在目前的技术条件下我们还不能完全抗拒自然灾害的袭击，因此国家计划对于农业来讲，还只能是带有估算性的间接计划；国家必须继续推进农业的合作化，继续加强计划收购和计划供应工作，加强对棉花等重要农产品的预购工作。在保证完成国家收购任务的条件下，还必须因地制宜，以发展农民的生产的积极性。
    国家对小商品生产的手工业也应当予以充分的注意，组织他们参加各种形式的合作社，在地方范围内进行统筹安排。对于外销的手工业品，和行销全国的手工业品，亦应当试作全国的平衡，把它们逐步地纳入国家计划。
    几年来的经验证明，在我国目前的情况下，用统一的国家计划来指导国民经济的发展和改造，不但十分必要，而且是可能的。几年来社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的迅速进展，不但要求我们把各种非社会主义经济成份逐步地、分别地纳入国家计划，而且已经为把这些经济成份逐步纳入国家计划创造了必要的条件。当然，在我们这样一个经济还比较落后，小农经济还占优势，资本主义经济也还占有相当重要地位的国家，要实行国民经济的全面计划管理也是有困难的，只能随着社会主义改造工作的开展而逐步前进。对各种非社会主义经济成份还必须善于利用价值规律、正确执行我们党的各种政策，通过加工定货计划、批发计划、计划收购和计划供应等工作，以及其它各种措施，以逐步加强其计划性，克服其盲目性。计划工作人员还必须加强调查研究，加强经济理论和经济政策的学习。只有如此，我们才可能把计划工作的水平逐步提高，进一步加强国家计划对国民经济发展的调节和指导作用。
