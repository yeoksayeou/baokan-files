Stop the South Vietnamese Conspiracy to Sabotage the International Commission

    On July 20th, the day stipulated by the Geneva Accords for both sides of Vietnam to consult and prepare for the Vietnamese general election, a large-scale attack, clearly instigated by the South Vietnamese authorities, was launched in Saigon, South Vietnam, against the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam. Two to three thousand special agents and thugs stormed the hotel where the International Commission was located, attacking Indian and Polish members of the Commission. The Indian Chairman of the Commission also suffered extreme humiliation. The thugs destroyed the Commission's offices and residences, looted important Commission documents, plundered all the belongings of the Indian, Polish, and Canadian commissioners, and then set fire to the building. According to Reuters, the International Commission's headquarters looked like it had been hit by a typhoon after the massive attack by the thugs.

    This outrageous attack by South Vietnam on the International Commission has aroused the greatest anger of peace-loving people around the world and has provoked strong reactions from many important relevant countries. The Chinese people believe that this attack is the most serious step taken by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to deliberately sabotage the Geneva Accords and the Vietnamese general election, and it harbors extremely dangerous consequences.

    Startled by the anger of the world's people, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is lying, claiming that this criminal act, which it instigated itself, was committed by the Communists. However, Agence France-Presse has pointed out: the special agents and thugs who attacked the International Commission were transported to Saigon on July 20th, the day of the attack, by the Ngo Dinh Diem's army in hundreds of trucks. Therefore, after attacking the International Commission, they even dared to parade through the streets, shouting slogans, and not dispersing until late at night. It is a definite conclusion that Ngo Dinh Diem is the organizer and instigator of this attack.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has always been hostile to the Vietnam International Commission. It has repeatedly insulted and threatened this international organization, which impartially fulfills its responsibilities stipulated by the Geneva Accords to ensure peace in Indochina. Most recently, on July 13th, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique directed thugs to break into the International Commission and attack Polish commissioners. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's propaganda machine had long begun to slander and attack the International Commission. As the date for consultation on the general election stipulated by the Geneva Accords approached, this slander developed into blatant inflammatory clamor. The day before issuing a statement refusing to consult on the general election, Ngo Dinh Diem openly accused the International Commission of being unable to assume the duty of supervising the election; at the same time, he began to launch so-called "denunciation of the Geneva Accords" "demonstrations" against the International Commission. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique does not care about the peace and national interests of Vietnam, disregards the common aspirations of the Vietnamese people, and perversely designated the day the Geneva Accords were signed as "National Humiliation Day," regarding the International Commission, which supervises the implementation of the Geneva Accords, as a thorn in its side. They attempt to use violent means to exacerbate tensions, to achieve the goal of abolishing the International Commission, thereby sabotaging the Geneva Accords and disrupting peace in Indochina.

    It must be pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique dared to launch this attack, obviously because it was encouraged and supported by American policy. The United States is instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to oppose consultations on general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords. Its propaganda organs have always echoed and strongly supported the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's wanton slander of the International Commission. This open opposition to the general election and this vicious attack on the International Commission by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique were clearly carried out with the connivance of the United States. The United States must bear serious responsibility for this incident.

    The Chinese people express extreme indignation at the barbaric attack suffered by the International Commission and Mr. Desai, the Indian Chairman of the Commission, and other commissioners. We extend our deep condolences to them. We believe that all countries concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the peace of Indochina must stop the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to sabotage the International Commission and the Geneva Accords. The safety of the International Commission's commissioners and all staff and the facilitation of their working conditions must be fully guaranteed.

### 制止南越破坏国际委员会的阴谋

    制止南越破坏国际委员会的阴谋
    七月二十日，日内瓦协议规定越南双方协商准备越南普选的那一天，在南越西贡发生了显然是由南越当局发动的对越南国际监督和监察委员会的大规模攻击。两三千名特务和暴徒冲进国际委员会会址所在的旅馆，袭击委员会的印度、波兰两国人员。委员会的印度主席也遭受了极大的侮辱。暴徒们捣毁了委员会的办公处和住所，劫走了委员会的重要文件，洗劫了印度、波兰、加拿大三国委员的一切财物，然后纵火焚烧。据路透社消息，在暴徒大袭击之后，国际委员会会址已经是一片台风过后的景象。
    南越向国际委员会的这种猖狂进攻，激起了全世界爱好和平人民最大的愤怒，引起了许多重要有关国家的强烈反应。中国人民认为这次进攻是吴庭艳集团蓄谋破坏日内瓦协议、破坏越南普选的最严重的步骤，它孕育着极其危险的后果。
    被世界人民的愤怒惊吓住了的吴庭艳集团正在撒谎，把它自己发动的这一罪恶行动说成是共产党干的。但是，法新社已经指出：这批进攻国际委员会的特务暴徒，是吴庭艳的军队在二十日，即行凶的那一天，用数百辆卡车运到西贡来的。因此，他们在进攻了国际委员会之后，还胆敢巡游街市，大喊口号，至晚不散。吴庭艳是这次进攻的组织者和发动者，这是肯定的结论。
    吴庭艳集团一向仇视越南国际委员会。它对于这个公正地履行日内瓦协议所规定的职责以保障印度支那和平的国际机构曾经进行了许多次的侮辱和威胁，最近，七月十三日，吴庭艳集团就指使过暴徒冲入国际委员会，并向波兰委员行凶。吴庭艳集团的宣传机器，早就开始对国际委员会滥施诽谤和攻击。随着日内瓦协议所规定的协商普选日期的迫近，这种诽谤就发展为公然煽动性的叫嚣。吴庭艳在发表拒绝协商普选声明的前一天，公开指责国际委员会不能担当监督选举的职务；同时，并开始发动所谓“谴责日内瓦协定”的“示威”，反对国际委员会。吴庭艳集团不把越南的和平和民族利益放在眼中，不顾越南人民的共同愿望，竟倒行逆施，把日内瓦协议的签订日定为“国耻日”，把监督日内瓦协议实施的国际委员会视为眼中钉。他们企图用暴行手段，来加剧紧张局势，达到取消国际委员会，从而破坏日内瓦协议、破坏印度支那和平的目的。
    必须指出，吴庭艳集团敢于发动这种攻击，显然是由于受到美国政策的鼓励和支持的。美国策动吴庭艳集团反对按照日内瓦协议协商普选。它的宣传机关对于吴庭艳集团肆意诽谤国际委员会的行为，一向是一唱一和，极力支撑。吴庭艳集团这次公开反对普选并对国际委员会发动这种凶恶进攻，显然是在美国的纵容之下进行的。美国方面对于这次事件必须负起严重的责任。
    中国人民对国际委员会和委员会印度主席德赛先生及其他委员们受到的横暴攻击表示极端的愤慨。我们对他们致以深切的慰问。我们认为，一切关心日内瓦协议的实施、关心印度支那和平的国家必须制止吴庭艳集团破坏国际委员会、破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋。国际委员会委员和所有工作人员的安全和他们工作条件的便利必须得到完全的保障。
