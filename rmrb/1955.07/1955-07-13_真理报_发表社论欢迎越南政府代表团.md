Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Warmly Welcoming the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam," stating: All Soviet people warmly welcome the representatives of the heroic Vietnamese people who have gained freedom and national independence in many years of fighting against imperialism.

"Pravda," in speaking of the Vietnamese people's struggle against the colonialists, pointed out: The Soviet people have always held feelings of sincere friendship and deep respect for the freedom-loving Vietnamese people. With brotherly sympathy, the Soviet people have closely watched how the Vietnamese patriots have heroically defended the freedom and honor of their motherland.

Since the cessation of military operations, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a policy of peace. Ensuring the national independence of the Vietnamese people, striving for the restoration of Vietnam as a unified country, and building a free and democratic state throughout the territory of Vietnam—these are the main tasks of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam sincerely and unswervingly implements the resolutions of the Geneva Conference and makes every effort to achieve national unification through general elections throughout the territory of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people's concern for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords stems from the desire to safeguard peace in the Far East and strive for a further relaxation of tensions in Asia and the world.

The Soviet people are concerned with brotherly sympathy for the democratic reforms that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Workers' Party are victoriously carrying out in all aspects. The Soviet people deeply understand the difficulties encountered by the Vietnamese working people in restoring the national economy destroyed by many years of war and are therefore prepared to provide fraternal assistance to the Vietnamese people. The visit to the Soviet Union by the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Vietnam and for strengthening the forces defending peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: Moscow newspapers on the 12th published editorials and articles welcoming the visit of Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam he led, to the Soviet Union.

"Pravda," "Izvestia," "Trud," and "Krasnaya Zvezda" all published large photos of President Ho Chi Minh on the front page. "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Warmly Welcoming the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." The title of the "Izvestia" editorial was "The Friendship of the Soviet and Vietnamese Peoples." The title of the "Krasnaya Zvezda" editorial was "The Fraternal Friendship of the Soviet and Vietnamese Peoples." "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published a feature article by Soviet journalist Strelnikov entitled "The People's President." All newspapers published news of President Ho Chi Minh and others visiting Novosibirsk and Sverdlovsk.
