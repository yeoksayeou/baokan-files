Those Who Carry Guns Must Learn to Recognize and Deal with Enemies Who Do Not Carry Guns
Chen Yi

Our army consists of people who carry guns. We are very vigilant when we are at our posts on the battlefield, on the border, in the air, and at sea. Even when we are training, we know why we are training, and the concept of the enemy is often in our minds. Especially when we are on the front line, facing the enemy face-to-face, fighting them with guns and cannons, we not only have a high degree of enemy awareness, but also great courage, determination, and various ways to defeat the enemy.

But for enemies who do not carry guns, those counter-revolutionary elements in disguise, counter-revolutionary elements who engage in double-dealing activities, most of us are not good at identifying; our combat skills in dealing with them, exposing them, and cracking down on them are not as good as on the battlefield. This is because most of us often lose vigilance when fighting against hidden counter-revolutionary elements. And the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements took advantage of this weakness of ours.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, some even waving the banner of Communists, also shouting about going deep into life, and pretending to be able to endure hardship. From their mouths, you can always get support for your erroneous remarks and comfort and encouragement for your so-called grievances; when talking to you, they can pretend to be very intimate with you, as if there is nothing to hide, so as to gain your trust and sympathy, and of course, further obtain your counter-revolutionary assistance. For example, your liberalism can provide them with valuable information; for example, if you grumble and are dissatisfied with the organization, they can know your feelings and attack you; over time, they will make you completely lose vigilance, be pulled over by them, and become their prisoners, and you still think they are the best people in the world and your most intimate friends.

The Party timely exposed the crimes of this gang of counter-revolutionary elements and called on each of us to heighten our vigilance and resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

However, not long ago, some comrades mistakenly thought that this was a matter for the literary and art circles and had little to do with our army. For example, when the local area was already vigorously opposing and exposing the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, when discussing it at an important meeting, I heard a comrade say: It's just that your literary and art circles produced a Hu Feng, making us accompany you to the meeting and get busy. Obviously, comrades who have this idea do not understand that the political purpose of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary gang is to oppose socialism and oppose carrying out socialist transformation. The reason why the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique appeared in a literary and artistic guise, I think, is mainly because most of the members of this counter-revolutionary clique were mixed in the literary and art circles, they were "poets" and "writers". They opened a gap from this relatively weak front of literature and art, occupied this front, and expanded from this front, which could confuse public opinion.

Even after the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was published, there were still some situations in a certain agency of the troops: some said that the Hu Feng clique was "scholars rebelling, and they will not succeed." Some worker-peasant cadres believed that they were uneducated, had never heard of Hu Feng, and had not read their books, so it had nothing to do with them. A warehouse manager of an artillery regiment said: I guarantee that there are no members of the Hu Feng clique in our warehouse. Some people only looked for acquaintances in the newspapers and did not pay attention to and be vigilant against the people around them. Some people also emphasized that they were busy with work and could not get involved. In the troops, it is understood that there are still many people in a state of paralysis. Some people know that a counter-revolutionary clique has been discovered in Beijing, but they still don't understand what this counter-revolutionary clique is all about.

It can be seen that the work of eliminating the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements has not been widely and deeply publicized and educated in our troops. Many of us are still paralyzed and not vigilant enough.

Are Hu Feng elements just scholars rebelling? Not at all. A meteorological staff officer of our East China Air Force was a member of the Hu Feng clique. He passed messages to the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. If he was not uncovered, he would continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in his work post, causing losses to our revolutionary cause.

We are uneducated and don't recognize Hu Feng, so we won't be affected by Hu Feng's counter-revolution? His counter-revolutionary activities won't "patronize" our troops? We don't know him, but he will try his best to get to know us. Guo Junqing—our combat hero—she doesn't know Hu Feng, but Hu Feng can visit her and write a biography for her. But Hu Feng does not emphasize that she gradually improved her class consciousness under the cultivation and education of the Party, but praises her "self-restraint." This invisibly spreads the theory of opposing the leadership of the Communist Party.

Isn't Lu Ling's novel "Battle on the Lowland", a reactionary novel that challenges the discipline of our army, spreading bad influence everywhere? Some of us only know that we want to fall in love and find a wife, and don't care where, in what occasion to look for them, and what kind of person is suitable. Lu Ling took this opportunity and described in his novel that a pair of young Chinese and Korean men and women could have fallen in love, but the discipline of the troops did not allow it. How should the discipline of the troops be interpreted here? It should be interpreted as: for combat, for the victory of combat; for consolidating the combat friendship between China and Korea forged with blood. The leadership of the Volunteer Army stipulated that Volunteer Army personnel should not fall in love or marry Korean girls based on this. Lu Ling wants to challenge this discipline, and uses their so-called "talent" and "skills" (actually just more vicious counter-revolutionary tricks) to describe the feelings of the two characters in the novel so delicately and lingeringly, that some people have to write and say after reading and listening: "How ruthless discipline is!"

Isn't this Hu Feng element Lu Ling and his novel challenging our discipline—the touchstone of the army?

You can guarantee that there are no Hu Feng elements in your warehouse, but it is difficult to guarantee that there are no Zhang Feng elements, Li Feng elements, who have the same counter-revolutionary purpose as Hu Feng and Hu Feng elements, around you, in your warehouse like yours. The "People's Daily" editorial on July 3 pointed out: "Among the large and small accidents that occurred in the economic enterprise system in 1954, more than 340 cases have been found to be counter-revolutionary sabotage accidents, and the number of cases that have not been found is much larger than this. There are also many cases of rural counter-revolutionary elements setting fire to granaries, forests, and agricultural producers' cooperative property, and carrying out homicides." Doesn't this deserve our vigilance? In fact, this kind of sabotage activity by counter-revolutionary elements also exists in our troops.

A Hu Feng element sneaked into our editorial department. He was very good at using double-dealing tactics to carry out activities and provoke the unity between the writers of the troops and the editorial department. For a long time, we always considered from the leadership of the editorial department itself (this consideration is also correct), and neglected that some opinions and dissatisfaction of the writers were far from the attitude and opinions that a Communist Party member and a revolutionary soldier should have, and thus neglected to investigate the source of these opinions. Some writers even completely stood on another position to oppose the army's advocacy of showing the new heroic figures of the army, and falsely accused "the army is the ancestor of advocating writing conceptualized things"; some writers relied on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique (of course, unconsciously) to gain their sympathy and support.

After this study of anti-Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we learned that Hu Feng elements were provoking and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. On the one hand, Hu Feng elements said in the editorial department: "This article is not well written and cannot be used"; on the other hand, they wrote to the writers and said: "Your article is very good, I strongly advocate using it, but the leadership does not agree, I have to transfer it to another place for you." Writers who lacked Marxist cultivation and Party spirit training were thus deceived. Later, the Hu Feng element took them to see Hu Feng and said: "Is it okay to come to Beijing without visiting this literary giant, the successor of Lu Xun—Hu Feng?" When they met, Hu Feng of course treated them with "courtesy." Naive writers naively felt "this is warmth." This is how they were captured. But they were still sleeping in the drum!

From here, we learned a lesson: Hidden counter-revolutionary elements are accustomed to "catering to your preferences." "Stroke your fur", make you feel comfortable, because of comfort, you become negligent, paralyzed, and lose your position. Facts have proved that not only Hu Feng elements, but all hidden counter-revolutionary elements are accustomed to adopting this method. It is not that they have not said counter-revolutionary things to you, propagated their counter-revolutionary remarks, and done their counter-revolutionary work; but when you are paralyzed to the point of comfort, satisfaction, and pleasure, you have completely lost vigilance, so you listen to bad words as good words, and you see bad things as good things.

Some people say: "Doing a good job in technology is politics." This is completely wrong. Gao Gang also advocated in the past: "Production is politics"; the Hu Feng clique said: "Art is politics", the result is that they don't want politics. Is it okay not to have politics? Can we do without the Communist Party, without Marxism-Leninism, and without the socialist motherland? Without the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism, without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the lofty goal of socialism and communism, what are we busy with work, busy with technology, and busy with production for?

Okay! Let you be busy with technology, busy with work, and can't get involved! Counter-revolutionary elements can get involved, can you stand by and do nothing?

We must point out that we cannot ignore the poison spread by the long-term storage of Hu Feng elements' works and translations in our army libraries. A small department library has more than 70 books by Hu Feng elements, and more than 140 people have borrowed them. The influence of these counter-revolutionaries can be gradually eliminated only through in-depth study of the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and by linking them to oneself and conducting self-examination.

We must also pay attention to the fact that some people in our troops still hold a "neutral" attitude towards the anti-Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which is very wrong. In fact, this is sympathizing with Hu Feng. We should heighten our vigilance and question the purpose and position of these "neutral" people until we find out.

We should all clear our minds and brighten our eyes. Therefore, we must first widely and deeply publicize and discuss the "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" compiled by the "People's Daily" in the troops. In particular, we must read and discuss it word by word and sentence by sentence according to the spirit of the preface, annotations, and editorials, and then link it to ourselves, learn to identify and deal with the hidden double-dealing counter-revolutionary activities, and then eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

It is not enough to just be satisfied with "we are people who carry guns, we have fought bravely on the battlefield, we despise the enemy and are not afraid of the enemy." We have to learn from the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to recognize and deal with the non-gun-carrying, hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    拿枪的人要学会识别和对付不拿枪的敌人
    陈沂
    我们军队，是拿枪的人。我们在战场上，在边疆，在空中，在海洋，守卫着自己的岗位的时候，我们是很警惕的；就是在练兵的时候，我们也知道练兵的目的是为什么，我们脑子中经常是有敌情观念的。特别当我们在战斗前线，面对面地对着敌人，枪对枪和炮对炮地来同敌人进行战斗的时候，我们不仅具有高度的敌情观念，而且具有战胜敌人的极大勇气、决心和各种各样的办法。
    但对不拿枪的敌人，那些披着伪装的反革命分子，进行两面派活动的反革命分子，我们绝大多数人就不善于识别；对付他们、揭发他们、破获他们的战斗本领就没有在战场上那样高明了。这是因为我们绝大多数人在同暗藏的反革命分子作斗争时往往丧失了警惕性的缘故。而胡风反革命集团和其他一切暗藏的反革命分子正是利用了我们这一弱点。
    胡风反革命集团混进了革命阵营，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，有的甚至打着共产党人的旗号，也喊深入生活，还装得很能吃苦的样子。从他们的口中你总是可以得到对你的错误言论的支持和对你受了所谓委屈的安慰和鼓励；同你谈话的时候，可以装得同你很知心，好像是无话不谈，这样来取得你对他的信任和同情，当然进一步就要取得你对他的反革命的帮助。比如你的自由主义就可以供给他很有价值的情报；比如你发牢骚、对组织不满，他就可以知道你的心情，就要向你进攻；久而久之，他就会使你完全丧失警惕，被他们拉过去，成了他们的俘虏，你还觉得他们是天下最大的好人、你最知心的朋友。
    党及时揭露了这帮反革命分子的罪行，号召我们每一个人提高警惕性，坚决肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    然而不久以前，还有一些同志错误地认为这是文艺界的事，同我们军队没有多大关系。例如，当地方上已经在轰轰烈烈地反对和揭露胡风反革命集团的反革命活动的时候，在一个重要的会议上讨论的时候，我就听到一个同志说：就是你们文艺界出了个胡风，弄得我们也陪着开会忙。很显然，有这种想法的同志不了解胡风反革命黑帮的政治目的，就是反对社会主义和反对进行社会主义改造。胡风反革命集团所以采取文艺面目出现，我想主要的是因为这个反革命集团分子大多是混在文艺界，是“诗人”、“作家”，他们从文艺这个比较薄弱的阵线上来打开个缺口，占领这个阵线，从这个阵线上来扩张，可以混淆一下视听。
    即使在关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料公布后，部队某机关中还有这样一些情况：有的说，胡风集团是“秀才造反，不会成功”。有些工农干部认为自己是老粗，从没有听说过胡风，也没有看过他们的书，同自己无关。一个炮兵仓库的管理员说：我保证我们库里没有胡风集团分子。有些人则只从报纸上去找有没有认识的人，不去注意和警惕身边的人。有些人还强调工作忙，插不进手。部队中，据了解，处在麻痹状况中的人还是不少。有的知道北京发现了一个反革命集团，但这个反革命集团是怎么回事还闹不清楚。
    可见关于肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的事情，在我们部队中还没有广泛地、深入地进行宣传和教育。我们好些人还是麻痹的、警惕性不高的。
    胡风分子仅是秀才造反吗？完全不是的。我们华东空军的一个气象参谋就是胡风分子，他为胡风反革命集团通消息，如果不破获，他就会在他那个工作岗位上不断进行反革命的活动，使我们的革命事业遭受到损失。
    我们是老粗，不认得胡风，就不会受胡风反革命的影响吗？他的反革命活动就不会“光临”到我们部队吗？我们不认识他，但他会千方百计地来认识我们。郭俊卿——我们的战斗英雄，她并不认识胡风，可是胡风可以访问她，可以为她写传，但胡风不强调她是在党的培养教育下逐步提高阶级觉悟，而称赞她的“自我克制”。这就无形中散布了反对共产党领导的理论。
    胡风分子路翎的小说“洼地上的‘战役’”，一部向我军纪律挑战的反动小说，不是到处散布恶劣影响吗？我们的有一些人，只知道要恋爱、要找老婆，就不管到什么地方、什么场合去找，以及找什么人才合适。路翎就投这个机，就在他的小说中描写一对中、朝青年男女本来是可以恋爱的，只是部队的纪律不允许。部队的纪律在这个地方应该怎样解释？应该解释为：为战斗，为战斗的胜利；为巩固中、朝两个国家用血结成的战斗友谊。志愿军的领导机关就是根据这个来规定志愿军人员不能和朝鲜姑娘恋爱、结婚。路翎就要向这个纪律挑战，而且把他们的所谓“才华”和“技巧”（实际只不过是更毒辣的反革命的伎俩罢了）用来把小说中两个人物的感情描写得那样细腻、缠绵，使得有些人看了、听了之后，不得不写、不得不说：“纪律多无情呀”！
    这不是胡风分子路翎和他的小说一起在向我们的纪律——军队的试金石挑战是什么呢？
    你可以保证你的库里没有胡风分子，但是同胡风和胡风分子具有一样反革命目的的张风分子、李风分子，在你的身边，在你的和你同样的库里也没有，就很难保证了。“人民日报”七月三日的社论指出：“一九五四年经济企业系统发生的大小事故中，已查清为反革命破坏事故的有三百四十多起，没有查清的比这个数目还要多得多。农村反革命分子纵火焚烧粮仓、森林和农业生产合作社财产，进行凶杀谋害的案件为数也很多”。这难道不值得引起我们警惕？事实上反革命分子的这种破坏活动也同样存在于我们部队中。
    有一个胡风分子钻进了我们的一个编辑部，他非常善于用两面派的手法来进行活动，挑拨部队作家同编辑部的团结。我们长时期总是从编辑部本身的领导上来考虑（这种考虑也是对的），而忽视作家们有些意见和不满已远非一个共产党员、革命军人所应该有的态度和应该提的意见，从而也忽视去追究这些意见的来源。有的作家甚至完全站在另外的立场来反对部队提倡表现部队的新英雄人物，并诬蔑“部队是提倡写概念化的老祖宗”；有些作家就靠到胡风反革命集团（当然是不自觉的）那边去，取得他们的同情和支持。
    经过这次反胡风反革命集团的学习，才知道是胡风分子在挑拨、在作反革命的活动。胡风分子一方面在编辑部说：“这文章写得不好，不能用”；一方面又给作家去信说：“你的文章很好，我是非常主张用的，但领导上不同意，我只好为你转到别的地方去”。缺乏马克思主义修养和党性锻炼的作家们，就这样上当了。后来那个胡风分子就带他们去见胡风，还说：“到北京来不拜见这位文坛巨人、鲁迅的承继者——胡风，还行吗？”见面时，胡风当然以“礼”待之。天真的作家们，竟幼稚地感到“这才是温暖”。他们就是这样被俘掳的。可是他们还睡在鼓里哩！
    从这里，我们得到一条教训：暗藏的反革命分子惯于“投你所好”。“顺着你的毛摸”，使你感到舒服，因舒服而疏忽，而麻痹，而丧失立场。事实证明，不仅是胡风分子，一切暗藏的反革命分子，都惯于采取这种手法。他们并不是没有向你说反革命的话，宣传他们反革命的言论，作出他们反革命的工作；而是当你麻痹到舒服、称心愉快的程度时，你已经完全失去警惕了，所以坏话你也当成好话听了，坏事你也当成好事看了。
    有人说：“搞好技术，就是政治。”这是完全错误的。高岗过去也曾提倡过：“生产就是政治”；胡风集团说：“艺术就是政治”，其结果，都是不要政治。不要政治行吗？我们离开共产党，离开马克思列宁主义，离开建设社会主义的祖国，能行吗？要是没有马克思列宁主义的思想指导，没有共产党的领导，没有社会主义、共产主义这个远大的目的，我们忙工作，忙技术，忙生产为的什么？
    好吧！让你忙技术，忙工作，插不进手吧！反革命分子可以插进手的，你能袖手不管吗？
    我们必须指出，不能忽视胡风分子的著作、译文在我们军队图书馆中长期存放所散布的毒素。一个小部门的图书馆就有胡风分子的书七十多本，而去借阅的就有一百四十多人。这些反革命的影响是要经过深入学习胡风反革命集团的材料、并联系自己、进行检查才能逐渐清除的。
    我们还必须提起注意：目前在我们部队中还有人对反胡风反革命集团抱着一种“中立”的态度，这是很错误的。实际上这是同情胡风。我们应该提高警惕，质问这些“中立”的人的目的和立场是什么，一直到弄清为止。
    我们都应该清醒我们的脑子，擦亮我们的眼睛，因此，我们首先就要在部队中广泛深入地宣传、讨论“人民日报”所编的“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”，特别要根据序言、按语、社论的精神逐字逐句的来阅读、讨论，进而联系自己，学会识别和对付暗藏的两面派的反革命活动，进而肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    不能仅仅满足于“我们是拿枪的人，我们曾在战场上勇敢战斗过，我们是藐视敌人和不怕敌人的”。这还不够。我们得从肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争中去学会识别和对付不拿枪的、暗藏的反革命分子。
