Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th. The "Izvestia" newspaper published an article on June 30th by an "Observer" entitled "Stop the Insults Against the Crew of the 'Tuapse' Tanker!" The summary is as follows:

    The Soviet tanker "Tuapse" was illegally intercepted in the high seas south of Taiwan, completely controlled by the U.S. Navy, a year ago. News constantly coming from Taiwan about the intolerable situation of the tanker's crew has aroused great anger among the Soviet public. Although the Soviet government has lodged numerous protests and demanded the immediate release of the tanker and its crew, the U.S. government has taken no action in this regard.

    Now, more news has emerged about the intolerable conditions of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse" crew. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are holding these Soviet crew members as criminals in a special camp. According to people who have visited this special camp, the Soviet crew members appear ill. The rations for the Soviet crew are insufficient to satisfy hunger. Their request to invite a French doctor and a translator has been consistently rejected.

    The Kuomintang elements are carrying out various provocations against the crew of the Soviet cargo ship "Tuapse," attempting to get them to sign statements that would tarnish their reputation. When this attempt failed, the extremely vicious Chiang Kai-shek elements adopted inhumane coercive measures against the crew. The driver, Voronov, who refused to sign a statement tarnishing his reputation, was confined to a mental hospital, and according to people who have visited him, Voronov's mental state is completely sound. Comrade Kalinin, the captain of the cargo ship, is being treated with particular barbarity. He is being held in solitary confinement, and although he is ill, he is still being subjected to all sorts of insidious provocations in an attempt to ruin his reputation and that of the entire crew.

    The U.S. authorities are, of course, aware of the particularly brutal and inhumane treatment of the illegally detained Soviet crew members by the Chiang Kai-shek elements. However, they pretend to be completely unconcerned. The Soviet public is deeply angered by the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek warmongers, and they demand that the brutal treatment of the Soviet crew members be stopped immediately, and that the cargo ship and its entire crew be released immediately.

　　停止对“图阿普斯号”油船船员的侮辱行为
　　——苏联“消息报”观察家文章的摘要
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：六月三十日“消息报”发表了“观察家”的一篇文章，题目是“停止对‘图阿普斯号’油船船员的侮辱行为！”摘要如下：
    苏联油船“图阿普斯号”在台湾以南受美国海军完全控制的公海上被非法拦劫已经一年了，由台湾不断传来的关于这艘油船的船员处于不能容忍的境况的消息引起苏联公众的极大愤怒。虽然苏联政府提出多次抗议，并且要求立即释放这艘油船和它的船员，而美国政府在这一方面没有采取任何措施。
    现在又传来关于苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的船员处于不能容忍的环境的消息。蒋介石当局把这些苏联船员当作罪犯一样囚居在一个特别营中。据到这一特别营中去看过的人说，苏联船员面露病容。苏联船员的口粮是不够充饥的。他们提出邀请一名法国医生和一名翻译的要求一直被拒绝。
    国民党分子对苏联货船“图阿普斯号”的船员进行各种挑拨，企图要他们在沾辱他们的声誉的声明上签名。当这种企图不能得逞的时候，穷凶极恶的蒋介石分子就对船员采取毫无人性的强制办法。拒绝在沾辱他的声誉的声明上签名的驾驶员沃罗诺夫被关进了疯人院，而据前去看望过他的人证明，沃罗诺夫的精神是完全健全的。货船的船长卡里宁同志受到特别野蛮的对待。他被单独囚禁着，虽然他生着病，但仍然对他进行千方百计的阴险的挑衅，企图毁坏他以及全体船员的声誉。
    蒋介石分子用特别残暴和非人道的手段对待被非法扣留的苏联船员，美国当局当然是知道的。但是他们装做一付好像与他们毫不相干的样子。苏联公众被蒋介石好战分子的海盗行为所深深激怒了，他们要求立刻停止对苏联船员采取的残暴态度，并立刻释放货船和全体船员。
