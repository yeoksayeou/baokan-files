    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 12th (TASS): The armed resistance of the Arab tribes in the British Protectorate of Aden, sparked by the British authorities' colonial policies, has entered its second week. Reports from this region of the Arabian Peninsula indicate that actual military operations have unfolded there between Arab tribes and British troops.
    As a result of the fierce fighting, not only have many poorly armed Arabs been killed and wounded, but the British army has also suffered considerable losses. According to newspaper reports, in the Qalhat area alone, seventy-three British soldiers were killed in ambushes by Arabs, and many others were captured. In the Saqqaf area, the armed tribes surrounded the British garrison and captured one hundred and fifty British soldiers and officers. Despite the harsh repressive measures taken by the British authorities, military operations in the Aden Protectorate continue.
    The local situation has become very unfavorable for the British, and their existing military forces in Aden are unable to suppress this armed resistance.
    The press has learned that, in order to support its troops in Aden, the British command is urgently transferring ground forces from the Suez Canal area there, and sending several squadrons of military aircraft, including several jet aircraft, from the island of Cyprus.
    According to the Yemeni Chargé d'Affaires in Egypt, Jalafi, speaking to Cairo newspapers, the British authorities are determined to keep this area under their control because they "smell the odor of oil in the southern Arabian Peninsula."

    亚丁人民武装反抗英国当局的殖民统治
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特十二日讯：由于英国当局的殖民政策而激起的英国保护地亚丁的阿拉伯部落的武装反抗已经进入第二周。从阿拉伯半岛这一地区来的消息指出，阿拉伯部落和英国军队在那里已展开了实际的军事行动。
    激烈战斗的结果，不仅武装薄弱的阿拉伯人中有许多伤亡，同时英国军队也遭到了相当大的损失。据报纸报道，仅在卡尔哈特地区，受到阿拉伯人的伏击而被打死的英国士兵就有七十三名，另外还有许多被俘的。在萨干角地区，武装反抗的部落包围了英国驻军，并且俘掳了一百五十名英国士兵和军官。尽管英国当局采取了残酷的镇压措施，但是亚丁保护地的军事行动仍在继续进行。
    当地情况变得对英国人非常不利，他们在亚丁现有的军事力量已无法镇压这次武装反抗。
    据新闻界获悉，英国司令部为了支援它在亚丁的军队，急急忙忙从苏彝士运河地区调遣地面部队到那里去，并且从塞浦路斯岛派去若干军用飞机中队，其中包括若干喷气式飞机。
    据也门驻埃及代办贾拉菲对开罗报纸说，英国当局因为“嗅到了阿拉伯半岛南部的石油气味”，无论如何要把这一地区控制在自己的手中。
