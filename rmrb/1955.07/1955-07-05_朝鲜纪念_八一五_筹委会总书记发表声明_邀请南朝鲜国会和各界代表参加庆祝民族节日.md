    新华社平壤四日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：纪念“八一五”解放十周年筹备委员会总书记金刚在二日发表声明说：纪念“八一五”解放十周年筹备委员会已经对南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、机关、教育文化和宗教团体的代表们发出了请柬，同时也对在日本和中国的朝鲜侨民组织的代表们发出了请柬，以便同全体同胞一起纪念这个民族节日。
    筹备委员会还邀请南朝鲜的文化和体育组织除了它们的代表之外再派遣相当规模的艺术代表团和体育代表团，来参加从七月二十五日起在平壤举行的庆祝“八一五”解放十周年纪念日全国艺术和体育节。筹备委员会将负责他们在共和国北部逗留期间的一切开支，并且将给予他们一切其他便利，保证他们在共和国任何地区自由旅行、参观和演出。
    声明说，这将有助于开展由于人为的分割而在过去十年中一直陷于隔阂状态的北朝鲜和南朝鲜人民的联系，促进他们的团结，而对于在国外的同胞也将起同样作用。这将大有助于促进祖国的和平统一。
