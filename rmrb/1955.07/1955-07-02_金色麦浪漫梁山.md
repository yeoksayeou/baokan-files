　　Golden Wheat Waves Romance Liangshan
　　By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    In late May, I travelled northeast from Yuncheng along the Songjin River, towards the historically famous Liangshan Marsh area. Coming here, it's easy to recall the world of water and reeds described in "Water Margin." About thirty *li* northeast of Yuncheng, across the Songjin River embankment, is the lowest-lying area of Yuncheng County. Because it's a series of connected depressions, people call it the Twelve Linked Depressions. The CCP Yuncheng County Seventeenth District Committee is stationed on the southwest edge of this large depression. Shortly after I arrived, District Committee Secretary Yuan Renjin wanted me to see their large depression. What he meant was that in just the past few years, people would no longer recognize this place. Indeed, the southwest wind blowing here today was not the boundless waves of water I had imagined, but golden waves of wheat. The wheat waves rose and fell, as if to overwhelm the low-lying Liangshan. Orioles, just arrived from the south, called as they flew over the golden waves, the wheat here was about to ripen.
      "Go and take a look at that Yihe Village!" Yuan Renjin pointed to a village deep in the dark green woods in front of Liangshan, and said, "In Yihe Village there's a Liang Junhou, he'll tell you about the changes in this large depression. Many large depressions and river滩 areas in Yuncheng, Liangshan, and Juancheng counties have become grain storage areas. The area of the Twelve Linked Depressions is less than 20,000 *mu*, far smaller than the 400,000 *mu* Houji Depression. But this is the lowest-lying area, and also the first to be transformed."
    Following Yuan Renjin's directions, I walked to a village surrounded by puddles and reeds, this was Yihe Village. Liang Junhou is the militia captain of Yihe Village and participated in ditch and furrow field work. He bared his chest and after saying only a few words to me, wanted me to see the large depression. As soon as we were out the door he said:
  "In the past, after a heavy rain, water would block the door, even the stone rollers in our courtyard would be submerged, and we often had to wade through water even when it was very cold." Liang Junhou said, "As long as I can remember, this large area of depressions has only yielded half a crop of sorghum, and two crops of wheat, and even those two crops couldn't match this year's single harvest. In those years, after autumn we would seal the doors with mud and go out to beg for food. These trees," Liang Junhou pointed to the dark green woods and said, "they wouldn't even sprout in May! Any tender buds would be picked and eaten."
    As we talked and walked, we came to a north-south road. Liang Junhou chuckled and said, "In the past, Yihe Village was three villages, Lianghai in the west; Yandian in the middle; and Chenlou in the east. Although these three villages were only separated by a road, the conflicts were really deep. They were constantly fighting with guns and knives over water for planting, the root of the conflict was water. A few years ago, when administrative villages were designated, these three villages were combined and renamed Yihe Village, but people were still estranged and didn't talk much when they met. Since the construction of ditches and furrow fields, we have had bumper harvests every year, and the people of the three villages have become harmonious in the process of building ditches and furrow fields. The begging sticks in our village have also been burned for firewood. Look at how many new houses we have in our village, just in that little bit of Lianghai, one hundred and thirty rooms have been built, and my family alone has built five. In the past, Yihe Village was a typical example of disaster relief! Last year, Lianghai alone bought more than 1,600 yuan of public bonds. All this is because of the ditches and furrow fields."
    People who have never seen ditches and furrow fields, even if they live in a place with them for a few days, will find it difficult to see them, let alone understand the great role they play in the bumper harvest of low-lying areas. I walked back and forth through this area with ditches and furrow fields twice, and it was still difficult to see what they looked like.
    "What exactly do ditches and furrow fields look like?" I asked Liang Junhou.
    "What's under your feet are ditches," Liang Junhou pointed to a road as wide as a bus route, with ditches on both sides. The roads in such a large area of low-lying land are all like this, with the road base built one or two *chi* higher than the ground. In the fields, there are earthen ridges half a *chi* high, that's the furrow field, and the earthen ridges of the furrow fields are all submerged in the undulating waves of wheat.
      "Look! Such a simple project can block the water flowing from the high ground. When it rains heavily, all the water is eliminated on the spot. Think about it, no matter how heavy the rain is, as long as the water from the high ground doesn't flow into the low-lying area, the crops won't be flooded. When it rains, the ground still drinks, and if the ground can't drink it all at once, it flows into the ditches beside the road. This is much better than building dikes to block the water every year, and not knowing how to drain the water after a heavy rain."
    Although the construction of the furrow field project was so simple, it took a lot of effort at the beginning. Many people said: What good is an earthen ridge one *chi* high! In the past, after a heavy rain, the water in this depression would be waist-deep, who could stop the water from flowing into the low-lying area! Building the road like a bus route would destroy a lot of crops, the crop seedlings are already so tall! Later, using the example of ten years of crop failure out of nine, they repeatedly mobilized for three or four days before the masses' minds were opened and construction began.
    The ditch and furrow field project in the Twelve Linked Depressions was piloted in July 1952. Three days after the project was completed, it rained heavily. That night, people were really nervous. Liang Junhou led a group of people wearing straw raincoats, carrying lanterns, and holding iron shovels, running back and forth on the ditches, looking at this and that, tossing and turning in the rain all night. The next day it was still raining, and the women stood in the village, asking if there was any water in the furrow fields. The people who came back from the fields answered in a happy tone: "It's not flooded, there's only a little bit of water in the small ditches." Later, the women simply ran to the fields to see the furrow fields. The comrades from the district also came, and the comrades from the water conservancy team of the special commissioner's office also came. They were all as concerned about the crops in the depression as the masses here.
    That autumn, this low-lying area in the southwest corner of Liangshan Marsh had its first bumper harvest. Wheat was also planted along with the high-lying areas.
    After the autumn harvest, the district didn't call for it, but they started working on their own, they built the roads higher and dug the ditches deeper.
    In the spring of 1954, before the thaw, the people of Yihe Village started clamoring again, they said: The superiors told us to build five *cun*, we'll build one *chi* and five *cun*. Later, they worked hard for forty days, and even Juancheng County, one hundred *li* away, which flowed water into their depression, built ditches and furrow fields. But the rain in the autumn of 1954 was no less than in 1953, and the feared millet, beans, and sweet potatoes all had bumper harvests, and even watermelons, which had never been planted before, had bumper harvests.

　　金色麦浪漫梁山
　　本报记者　陈勇进
    五月下旬，我从郓城沿宋金河往东北，走向人们所熟知的历史上的梁山水泊地带。来到这里，不难使人想起“水浒”上所描述的水和芦苇的世界。离郓城东北三十来里路，过了宋金河堤，便是郓城县最低洼的地方。因为这里是洼地连着洼地，人们都叫十二连洼。中共郓城县十七区区委会就驻在这个大洼的西南边。我刚到这里不久，区委书记袁仁锦就要我看看他们这个大洼。他的意思是说，仅仅这几年来，人们就不会再认得这个地方了。的确，这天西南风在这里刮起的不是我想像的无边的水的波涛，而是金黄色的麦浪。麦浪起伏着，像是要漫过那低矮的梁山。刚从南方飞来的布谷鸟儿，从那金色波浪的上面叫唤着飞过去，这里的小麦就要成熟了。
      “你到那义合村去看看吧！”袁仁锦用手指着梁山前面的黑黝黝的树林深处的一个村庄，说：“义合村上有个梁君厚，他会告诉你这片大洼变化的情形。郓城、梁山、鄄城三县很多大水洼，河滩，都变成粮食囤了。十二连洼的面积还不到两万亩，比起候集那四十万亩的大洼差远了。但这是最洼的地方，也是变得最早的地方。”
    我按着袁仁锦的指引，走到一个被水坑和芦苇包围的村庄，这就是义合村。梁君厚是义合村民兵队长、沟洫畦田工作的参加者。他裸露着胸怀同我说了没几句话就要我去看大洼。一出大门就说：
  “过去一下大雨，水就堵着大门了，我们这场里的石滚都被水漫过了，往往到很冷的时候还要淌着水走路。”梁君厚说：“从我记事起，这大片洼洼里，只收过半季高粮，两季麦子，两季麦子也赶不上今年这一季收的多。那些年，一过秋天把大门用泥一封就出外逃荒了。这些树，”梁君厚用手指着那深绿色的树林子说：“到这五月里还发不出芽来哩！有几个嫩芽芽，就被人采着吃了。”
    我俩说着走着，来到一条南北大路边，梁君厚嘿嘿地笑了笑说：“过去我们义合村是三个村，西头是我们梁垓；当中是阎店；东头是陈楼，虽然这三个村只有一路之隔，矛盾实在深。为了放水种地整天价动枪动刀的，矛盾的根儿就是水。前几年划行政村时，这三个村合了，改名为义合村，可是人们还是有隔阂，见面不大说话。自从修了沟洫畦田，年年得到了丰收，三个村的群众在修筑沟洫畦田工程中和睦起来了。我们这村上的要饭棍也当柴火烧掉了，你看看我们村上有多少新房子，俺梁垓那一小疙瘩，就盖了一百三十间，光我家就盖了五间。过去我们义合村可是救灾的典型哩！去年光梁垓就买了一千六百多元的公债。这一切都是因为有了沟洫畦田。”
    没有见过沟洫畦田的人们，就是在这有沟洫畦田的地方住上几天，也很难看到它，更难理解它对低洼地带的丰收起了那么大的作用。我来回从这筑有沟洫畦田的地方走了两趟，还难以看出沟洫畦田的面貌来。
    “沟洫畦田到底是个什么样子呢？”我问梁君厚。
    “你脚下就是沟洫，”梁君厚指着像公共汽车路那样宽阔的一路两壕的道路。这么大面积低洼地方的道路，都像这条路样，路基比地面筑高了一两尺。在田地里，筑有半尺高的土埂，那就是畦田，畦田的土埂全部被淹没在起伏的麦浪里。
      “你看吧！这么简单的工程，就能挡着从高地方流来的水，下了大雨，都就地消灭了。你想吧，雨下得再大，只要高的地方的水不往这洼地里流，就淹不了庄稼，雨下着，地还喝着，地一下儿喝不了，就流到路边的壕里去。这比往年，年年筑堤挡水，下了大雨后疏水不知强多少倍。”
    修筑沟田的工程，虽然如此简单，在开始时，也曾经费了不少劲儿。很多人都说：一尺高的土岗子，顶什么事呀！过去一下大雨，这洼里就是腰多深水，谁能管住水不往洼处流了呢！把大路修得像汽车路那样，得毁好多庄稼，庄稼苗子都那样高了呀！后来，用过去十年九不收的实例，反复动员了三四天，才把群众思想搞通，开工兴建。
    十二连洼的沟洫畦田工程是一九五二年七月试办的，工程做完后三天就下了大雨。那天夜里，人们可真是紧张，梁君厚领着一班人披着蓑衣，提着灯笼，拿着铁锨，在沟洫上跑来跑去，看了这个看那个，整整地在雨里折腾了一夜。第二天雨还在下，妇女们就站在村上，问畦田里到底有水没有水。从地里回来的人，带着愉快的腔调回答：“没有淹，小沟里才那么一点点水。”后来，妇女们干脆跑到地里去看畦田去了。区里的同志也来啦，专署水利队的同志也来啦，他们都像这里的群众一样挂念着洼里的庄稼。
    这年秋天，梁山泊西南角的这块低洼地带第一次丰收了。麦子也和高地方一块种上了。
    秋后，区里没有号召，他们就干起来了，他们把路筑得更高、壕挖得更深了。
    一九五四年春天，还没化冻，义合村的人们又嚷嚷起来了，他们说：上级叫咱修五寸，咱们修一尺五。以后他们整整干了四十天，连向他们洼地流水的一百里以外的鄄城县也修起了沟洫畦田。可是一九五四年的秋天雨比一九五三年并不小，怕淹的谷子、豆子、甘薯都丰收了，连从来没种过的西瓜也丰收了。
