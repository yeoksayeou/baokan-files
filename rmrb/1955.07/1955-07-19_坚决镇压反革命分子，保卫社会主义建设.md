Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Elements and Defend Socialist Construction
    National People's Congress Representative Cheng Boren

    From the love and hatred of the broad masses of farmers, I have a clearer understanding of how to defend socialist construction and severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements.

    In June of this year, during our inspection work in Xi'an, Weinan, Baoji, Xingping, Lintong, and other places in Shaanxi with other representatives, we gained a broader and deeper understanding of the feelings of the broad masses of farmers. They support the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government with boundless enthusiasm. They said without any embellishment: Although it hasn't rained thoroughly for more than 130 days this year, which is unprecedented in the past 32 years and even more severe than the great drought of 1929, unexpectedly, the wheat harvest this year is not bad, with yields of 200 jin per mu, 300 jin per mu, and even more in some individual cases. What is the reason for this? It is the result of the Communist Party leading the broad masses of farmers since liberation to organize and build water conservancy projects, promote improved varieties, advocate deep plowing and moisture conservation, and promote rational close planting. Precisely because of this, we were able to achieve unexpected results under the threat of a severe drought. Also, like this year when rainfall was insufficient, grain prices have remained stable throughout. The farmers said: If grain was still controlled by private merchants this year, the grain prices would have skyrocketed! However, thanks to the People's Government's policy of unified purchase and supply, in the period between harvests and when it hadn't rained for a long time, timely supply was achieved, ensuring the stability of grain prices. The vast majority of farmers are not only not worried, but also have high morale and continue to buy a lot of things, such as farm tools, waterwheels, livestock, printed cloth, rain boots, thermos bottles, etc. They said: If it weren't for unified purchase and supply, this year would probably be inevitable bankruptcy, and in the old society, we would even have to sell our children and starve. It is precisely because of the leadership and care of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government that we have overcome difficulties, conquered natural disasters, and brought excitement to every person.

    However, what we are happy about is exactly what our enemies hate. We have overcome natural disasters, and the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation is constantly moving forward. American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, as well as all the counter-revolutionary elements hiding on the mainland, will hate us even more and will use various disguises and conspiracies to carry out a desperate struggle, vainly attempting to revive. Their evil activities include:

    1.  Recruiting bandits, developing organizations, and plotting riots. In Xi'an, Weinan, Baoji, and other places, dozens of counter-revolutionary cases such as the "China Dispatch Army" and "Zhongdao" were uncovered last winter and this spring. They were all appointing officials, faking seals, documents, and raising funds and weapons, conspiring to organize riots, and most of them were released after serving their sentences. In the uncovered "Zhongdao" case, most of them were Yi Guan Dao members who had previously signed statements to withdraw from the Dao. Among the seized evidence were weapons, military and administrative organization materials, etc.

    2.  Sabotaging our central tasks. Seeking gaps in our various tasks, sowing discord, or preventing farmers from joining agricultural cooperatives, or infiltrating agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams to carry out sabotage. Some even pretended to be active and seized leadership positions in cooperatives and teams, deliberately creating disputes and carrying out various acts of sabotage. These are mostly stubborn landlords and rich peasant elements. Some landlord elements even collected abolished debts from farmers, and even threatened the farmers, saying: "Whoever divides my land will be accounted for, and after ten years, the land will return to its original owner, and your days are numbered." They also tried every means to sabotage unified purchase and supply, conscription, the issuance of new currency, and other tasks. Whenever there were major international events, the bandits took the opportunity to spread rumors. Reactionary slogans have been repeatedly found in Xi'an and Weinan.

    3.  In Heyang and other places, there were also incidents of counter-revolutionary elements assassinating cadres and activists. During the summer harvest, there were even more incidents of bandits setting fires. The wheat of the security committee member of Kounan Village, Lintong Fifth District, was burned by bad guys for more than a cart.

    These situations show that the destructive activities of the hidden counter-revolutionary elements are very rampant at present; but no matter how capable these guys are, they cannot escape the eyes and palms of the people. The broad masses of people demand that the government further suppress counter-revolutionary elements. They all feel that our policies are still too lenient. They said: "We reported them, and they were released after a few days of detention, so we will not report them again." "These people have not been reformed, they are still arrogant, and they always want to bully people." Like the masses in Baiyangzhai, Weinan, they felt that the Yi Guan Dao leader Yang Qin was managed too loosely, and he was still associating with disreputable people, secretly engaging in reactionary Dao activities, and spreading rumors to deceive the masses.

    As the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation develops day by day, and as we are fighting for the liberation of Taiwan, the class struggle is very sharp, and counter-revolutionary elements and class enemies will certainly not be willing to die. We must raise our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, and see everything clearly. All counter-revolutionary criminals and recidivist criminals who should be arrested must be arrested, and those who should be severely punished must be severely punished. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of the people are sure to have the power to eliminate these "bad apples" to protect the unprecedented great cause of socialist construction.

    The cause of justice cannot be destroyed by any enemy, and those who destroy the cause of justice are the public enemies of the people. We must resolutely eliminate these enemies completely, and we will surely be able to eliminate them completely!

    坚决镇压反革命分子，保卫社会主义建设
    全国人民代表大会代表　成柏仁
    从广大农民的爱和憎中，我更清楚地认识到应如何保卫社会主义建设和严厉镇压反革命分子。
    本年六月间，我同其他代表在陕西的西安、渭南、宝鸡、兴平、临潼等地视察工作中，更广泛、更深刻地了解了广大农民的心情。他们是以无限的热情来拥护中国共产党、毛主席和人民政府的。他们毫无虚饰地说：虽然今年一百三十多天没落透雨，这是三十二年来所没有的，比一九二九年的大旱还严重；可是，出人意料的今年的麦子打得还不错，每亩产量有二百来斤的，有三百来斤的，也有个别更多的。这是什么原因呢？这是解放以来，共产党领导广大农民，组织起来兴修水利、推广良种、提倡深耕保墒和合理密植的效果。正因为这样，所以才能在严重旱灾的威胁下，还得到了出乎意料的一定收成。又像在今年天雨欠缺的情况下，粮价始终稳定。农民们说：今年要是粮食还操纵在私商手里的话，那粮价真不知要怎样窜箭冒节地上涨呀！可是，由于人民政府统购统销的政策，在青黄不接、久不落雨的情况下，做到了及时供应，保证了粮价的稳定；绝大部分农民不但不焦心发愁，而且生产情绪很高，还照常买回了不少东西，像农具、水车、牲口、花布、雨鞋、手电、暖水瓶等等。他们说：要不是统购统销，今年恐怕难免破产，像在旧社会的话甚至还要卖儿卖女饿肚子。正是由于共产党、毛主席和人民政府的领导和关怀，才克服了困难，战胜了天灾，才给每一个人民带来了兴奋。
    可是，我们所高兴的，正是我们的敌人所痛恨的。我们战胜了天灾，使社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业不断地向前发展，美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团以及隐藏在大陆上的所有的反革命分子就更会仇恨我们，更会利用各种伪装和阴谋活动，进行垂死挣扎，妄想死灰复燃。他们进行的罪恶活动有：
    一、搜罗匪徒，发展组织，图谋暴乱。西安、渭南、宝鸡等地，在去冬和今春破获的“中国派遣军”、“中道”等反革命案数十起。他们都是封官委职、假造印信、证件、筹集经费和武器，阴谋组织暴乱，且多是刑满释放分子。在破获的“中道”案中，又多是曾具结退道的一贯道分子。在缴获的罪证中，有武器，有军事、行政组织材料等。
    二、破坏我各项中心工作。在我各项工作中找寻空隙，挑拨离间，或是阻止农民参加农业合作社，或则混入农业合作社、互助组进行破坏。甚至有的伪装积极，窃取了社、组领导职位。故意制造纠纷，进行种种破坏。这些多是顽固的地主、富农分子。有的地主分子竟向农民收废债，还威胁农民说：“谁分我的地都有账，十年后地还老家，你们的日子没有几天了。”对统购统销、征集补充兵员、发行新币等各项工作，也无不千方百计进行破坏。每遇国际方面的重大事件，匪徒们都乘机造谣。西安、渭南并曾屡次发现反动标语。
    三、在郃阳等地，还发生了反革命分子暗杀干部和积极分子的事件。在夏收中，匪特放火的事件更多。临潼五区寇南村治安委员的麦子就被坏人烧了一车多。
    这些情况说明，目前暗藏的反革命分子的破坏活动是非常嚣张的；可是不论这些家伙有多么大的本领，总不能逃出人民的眼睛和手掌。广大人民要求政府进一步镇压反革命分子。他们都嫌我们的政策还是太宽大了。他们说：“我们检举了，关上几天又放了，这样的话我们再不检举了。”“这些人并没有改造过来，还是神气十足，见人总想欺侮。”像渭南白杨砦的群众，嫌把一贯道头子杨芹采管得太松，依然让他同些不三不四的人来往，暗中进行反动的道门活动，造谣欺骗群众。
    当社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业日益发展，当我们正在为解放台湾而斗争之际，阶级斗争是十分尖锐的，反革命分子和阶级敌人一定不会甘心死亡，我们必须提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，看清一切。对于一切反革命罪犯和屡教不改的犯罪分子，该捕者一定要捕，该从严惩办者一定要从严惩办。在共产党和人民政府领导下的广大人民群众，一定有力量把这些“害群之马”清除干净！以保卫史无前例的伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    正义的事业是任何敌人都破坏不了的，破坏正义事业的，就是人民的公敌。我们要坚决把这些敌人消灭干净，并且一定能消灭干净！
