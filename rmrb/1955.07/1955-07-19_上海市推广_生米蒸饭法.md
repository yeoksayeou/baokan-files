    Shanghai is promoting the "raw rice steaming method"
    Many units and neighborhood residents in Shanghai are actively seeking ways to improve cooking methods and save food. Many units have successfully tested the "raw rice steaming method." According to relevant departments, steaming rice can generally yield ten taels more cooked rice per jin of rice compared to boiling. If all canteens in Shanghai adopt the steaming method, approximately 84 million jin of grain can be saved annually.
    The "raw rice steaming method" was originally used in Guangdong, Sichuan, and other places. This year, during the food saving campaign, many units in Shanghai tested and promoted this method. According to experiments at Chengzhong High School, in the past, using the old boiling method, each jin of indica rice could produce about two jin and six taels of cooked rice, and japonica rice could produce about two jin and three taels. After switching to the "raw rice steaming method," each jin of indica rice can produce two jin and fourteen taels to three jin of steamed rice, with the best expanding indica rice yielding more than three jin and six taels. Each jin of japonica rice can yield about two jin and ten taels. The new method produces rice that is about 20% to 21% heavier and 15% larger in volume than the old method, which means a 15% saving in grain. According to the school's grain consumption, the old method required about 550 jin of rice per day, while steaming only requires 470 jin per day. This saves more than 80 jin of grain per day, or more than 2,000 jin of grain per month (calculated for 26 days, with no meals served on Sundays), which plays a significant role in saving grain. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tilanqiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the school has introduced the "raw rice steaming method" to more than 680 units in the Tilanqiao District. More than 100 canteens from other districts have also sent people to visit the school. The Secretariat of the Putuo District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent people to Chengzhong High School to learn the "raw rice steaming method." After adopting this method in the agency's canteen, the rice yield per jin also increased from two jin and two taels to about three jin. In June, even with ten days of not steaming rice, the unit saved 874 jin of grain compared to May.
    Rice made with the "raw rice steaming method" is softer, more nutritious, and very popular. The cooking procedures and equipment for the "raw rice steaming method" are also very simple. Currently, many units in Shanghai are preparing to promote this method.

### 上海市推广“生米蒸饭法”

    上海市推广“生米蒸饭法”
    上海市许多单位和里弄居民积极设法改进烧饭方法，节约粮食。不少单位已经试验“生米蒸饭法”成功。据有关方面计算，蒸饭比煮饭一斤米一般可以多出十两饭，上海全市伙食团如果都采用蒸饭的办法，每年约可节约粮食八千四百万斤。
    “生米蒸饭法”原来早已在广东、四川等地采用，今年在节约粮食运动中，上海市许多单位试验推广了这一办法。据澄衷中学的试验，过去用旧法煮饭，每斤籼米可煮饭二斤六两左右，粳米可煮二斤三两左右；改用“生米蒸饭法”以后，每斤籼米可蒸饭二斤十四两到三斤左右，胀性最好的籼米可蒸到三斤六两以上，粳米每斤可蒸二斤十两左右。新法比旧法做的饭重量约增加百分之二十到二十一，体积增加百分之十五，也就是节约了百分之十五的粮食。根据这个学校的用粮情况，用旧法煮饭每天须用米五百五十斤左右，改为蒸饭以后，每天只用米四百七十斤，每天能节约粮食八十多斤，一个月以二十六天计算（星期日不开伙），能节约二千多斤粮食，对节约粮食起了很大的作用。在中共上海市委、中共提篮桥区委的领导下，这个学校已经把“生米蒸饭法”向提篮桥区六百八十多个单位作了介绍；外区也有一百多个单位的伙食团曾派人到这个学校参观。中共普陀区委秘书室派人到澄衷中学学习了“生米蒸饭法”，在机关的食堂中采用这一办法以后，每斤米的出饭率也由二斤二两提高到三斤左右。六月份内，这个单位有十天没有蒸饭，还比五月份节约了八百七十四斤粮食。
    用“生米蒸饭法”做出的饭，比较软和，营养也好，很受欢迎。“生米蒸饭法”的做饭手续和设备也很简单。目前，上海市许多单位正在准备推广这一办法。
