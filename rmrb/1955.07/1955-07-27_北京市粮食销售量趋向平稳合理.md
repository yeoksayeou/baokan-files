    Beijing's work on saving grain is being carried out in depth. Since April, the city's grain sales have maintained a trend of gradual, stable and reasonable decline. For example, if the grain sales volume in April is taken as 100, then it was 92 in May, 84 in June, and continued to decline in July.

    The method of verifying and supplying grain on a household basis has been supported by the majority of citizens in the capital. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee transferred 7,200 trained cadres to go deep into the streets to publicize and help residents verify their grain consumption. After formulating family grain consumption plans in June, residents have a clear idea of the amount of grain they need. They see that grain verification and supply is both "guaranteed to be enough" and "saves grain," which is beneficial to themselves and the country, thus dispelling the concerns that "the plan won't be enough." Many residents who originally "padded the numbers" and set their plans too high, voluntarily lowered their plans in July. The family grain consumption plans of residents in various districts of the city in July were generally closer to actual needs than in June.

    From July, all collective catering units such as municipal agencies, enterprises, factories, schools, and hospitals began to compile grain consumption plans based on formal household registration. Every staff member and worker of state organs must correctly compile their individual grain consumption plans. People who eat in both the organs and at home can get grain coupons from grain retailers with their purchase certificates and use the coupons to join the mess in the organs. On this basis, each collective catering unit compiles its own grain consumption plan according to the actual number of people eating grain. The plan must be carefully reviewed and signed by the person in charge of the unit. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee also stipulated that the inventory grain of collective catering units should be cancelled, and the mobile grain should be strictly controlled. At the end of the month, the grain stored in the warehouses of each unit will be deducted in full by the People's Committee of each district when verifying the grain consumption plan for the next month. Some units store more grain in their warehouses than they need in July, so they only order plans in July and do not purchase grain. The implementation of these measures has blocked the loopholes of double-receiving grain, and has played a significant role in overcoming the phenomena of "padding the numbers" and "falsely reporting population and fraudulently receiving grain." The grain consumption plans of collective catering units in the city in July have already decreased compared with June, but the plans of many units are still too high. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has decided to dispatch a group of cadres to conduct a serious inspection of collective catering units such as government agencies and enterprises.

    The grain consumption of Beijing's catering, food and other industries has also begun to be adjusted based on the principle of saving.

### 北京市粮食销售量趋向平稳合理

    北京市粮食销售量趋向平稳合理
    本报讯　北京市的节约粮食工作正在深入展开。四月份以来，全市粮食销售量保持着逐步平稳合理下降的趋势。如以四月份粮食销售量为一百，则五月份为九十二，六月份为八十四，七月份续有下降。
    按户核实供应粮食的办法已经得到首都广大市民的拥护。北京市人民委员会曾抽调七千二百名经过训练的干部，深入街道宣传，帮助居民核实粮食用量。居民们经过六月份制定家庭用粮计划，对自己需用粮食数量心中有数了。他们看到，粮食核实供应，既“保证够吃”，又“节约粮食”，对自己对国家都是有益无害的，因此打消了“订了计划怕不够吃”的顾虑。许多原先“宽打窄用”把计划订得偏高的居民，在七月份自动把计划降低。全市各区居民七月份的家庭用粮计划一般比六月份接近实际的需要。
    全市机关、企业、工厂、学校、医院等集体伙食单位从七月份起开始按正式户口编制用粮计划，每一个国家机关工作人员和职工都要正确编制个人用粮计划。在机关和家里两头吃饭的人，凭购粮证到粮食代销店领取粮票，凭票到机关入伙。各集体伙食单位在这个基础上按照实际吃粮人数编造本单位用粮计划，计划必须经本单位负责人认真审核签字。北京市人民委员会并规定取消集体伙食单位的库存粮，严格掌握机动粮。各单位月底库存粮食，各区人民委员会在核查下月用粮计划时都要全部扣除。有些单位仓库储存粮食超过七月份需用粮食，它们七月份便只订计划，不予购粮。实行了这些措施，就堵塞了重领粮食的漏洞，对克服“宽打窄用”、
  “虚报人口、冒领粮食”的现象起了很大作用。七月份全市各集体伙食单位用粮计划比六月份已有降低，但尚有不少单位的计划仍然偏高，北京市人民委员会已决定抽调一批干部对机关、企业等集体伙食单位进行一次认真的检查。
    北京市各饮食、食品等行业用粮，根据节约的原则，也已开始进行调整。
