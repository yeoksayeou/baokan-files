Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 5th: According to newspaper reports, Indonesian President Sukarno said at a mass meeting in Solo on the 4th that he is trying to seek a solution to the crisis in the army, which arose from Acting Army Chief of Staff Lubis's opposition to the appointment of Udojo as Army Chief of Staff, by "allowing reason to prevail, restraining emotions, focusing on national unity, and on the basis of understanding and goodwill on both opposing sides." Sukarno expressed his conviction that this serious problem could be resolved satisfactorily through this approach.

It is reported that Sukarno held talks with Defense Minister Kusumasumantri and Justice Minister Gondokusumo in Yogyakarta on the 4th, who went there to report to Sukarno on the latest situation.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian government held another meeting on the 4th to discuss the crisis in the army. Information Minister Tubin said that the government would immediately submit a report on the meeting to President Sukarno.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: TASS, Jakarta, July 4th: With the Indonesian general election approaching, the political situation in Indonesia has become significantly more acute. According to newspaper reports, reactionary forces are attempting to divide the growing unity among the people and provoke a government crisis to postpone the election. Opposition parties are loudly publicizing a motion of no confidence in Defense Minister Kusumasumantri by some members of parliament. A group of senior military officers, headed by Colonel Lubis, continues to disregard the government's decision to appoint General Bambang Udojo as Army Chief of Staff.

Broad social strata are calling for increased vigilance because certain senior military officers are attempting to establish a military fascist regime in the country and eliminate the democratic achievements of the republic. On the 3rd, Justice Minister Gondokusumo issued a statement calling for vigorous measures to deal with those elements who attempt to use the army to achieve personal goals and endanger the republic.

　　苏加诺总统表示正设法解决陆军中的危机
    印度尼西亚反动势力企图挑起政府危机阻挠普选
    新华社雅加达五日电　据报纸报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺四日在梭罗举行的群众大会上说，他正在设法通过“使理智占优势，使感情受抑制和从全国团结着眼，并在两个相反方面的谅解和善意的基础上”，来寻求解决陆军中由于代理陆军参谋长卢比斯反对任命乌多约为陆军参谋长而产生的危机的办法。苏加诺表示确信，通过这种办法，这个严重的问题可以获得圆满解决。
    据悉，苏加诺四日在日惹同国防部长库索马素曼特里和司法部长龚多古苏莫举行了会谈，他们是到那里去向苏加诺报告最近的局势的。
    同时，印度尼西亚政府在四日再次举行会议，讨论陆军中的危机的问题。情报部长杜斌说，政府将立刻向苏加诺总统提出关于这次会议的报告。
    新华社四日讯　　塔斯社雅加达四日讯：随着印度尼西亚普选的日益接近，印度尼西亚的政治局势显著地尖锐化起来。据报纸消息说，反动势力企图分裂人民中间日益增长的团结，并且企图挑起政府危机以使选举延期。反对党大吹大擂议会中一些议员对国防部长库索马素曼特里表示不信任的动议。以卢比斯上校为首的一批高级军官还是对政府任命班邦·乌多约将军为陆军参谋长的决定置之不理。
    广大的社会阶层号召提高警惕，因为某些高级军官企图在国内建立军事法西斯政权，并消灭共和国的民主成果。三日，司法部长龚多古苏莫发表声明，号召采取有力措施来对付那些企图利用陆军达到个人目的、使共和国陷于危险境地的分子。
