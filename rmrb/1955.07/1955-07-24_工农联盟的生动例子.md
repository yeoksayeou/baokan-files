A Vivid Example of the Worker-Peasant Alliance

To the Editors:

All the farmers in our village are expressing their immense excitement and gratitude to the workers of the Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) Gongchangling Iron Mine for their selfless help in our agricultural technology reforms.

Our Hudaizibao Village is a cooperative village in the tenth district of Liaoyang County. The whole village has organized seven agricultural production cooperatives and three mutual aid teams. This year, in order to further tap the potential of agricultural production and increase grain yield, our village plans to expand the acreage of paddy fields in Hudaizibao Village. We also plan to plant rice in some low-lying areas of the Xu and Kan natural villages, where rice has never been planted before. However, the biggest difficulty is the lack of water for irrigation. Later, after research by myself, production committee member Xu Yongming, and commune member Xu Yongxiang, we decided to repair and改造 the old water mill (this kind of mill used water power to grind wood flour to supply incense shops before liberation, hence it was also called an incense mill) and use the water power to drive a water pump to solve the water shortage problem. Just at this time, the county water conservancy department lent us 1,000 yuan. So, we used the gears and pulleys from a cotton gin that farmers had used after liberation to install the pump. But after several trials, we still couldn't pump water. This made everyone very anxious. Some said, "Let's just forget about it!" Zhao Chunyang, the director of the Gangqiang Agricultural Production Cooperative, also said without confidence, "The river is more than six meters lower than the ground, how can we pump water up?"

At this critical moment, I suddenly remembered that when the farmers in our village and the worker elder brothers from Gongchangling Iron Mine held a worker-peasant get-together during the Spring Festival this year, the worker elder brothers repeatedly told us to come to them for assistance if we had any difficulties. Thinking of this, I felt like a window had been opened in my heart, and everyone's spirits were lifted when they heard that we were going to ask the worker elder brothers for assistance. So, Xu Yongxiang and I went to the Angang Gongchangling Iron Mine (thirty miles from our village) through the district committee to find Secretary Wang and Mine Director Li of the Party Committee. When Secretary Wang and Mine Director Li heard that we wanted to改造 the water mill to grow high-yield crops, they expressed their strong support and sent two veteran technicians, Wang Youchun and Zhang Baoqing, to our village to help with the design. After looking at the water mill, they found that the main reason why the water could not be pumped was that the iron gear was too small. After returning to the mine, they made a large iron gear and three pulleys out of scrap iron. The two of them also braved the drizzle to help install them. On May 15th, the river water gushed out of the water pump like a flood. At this time, everyone was so happy that they didn't know what to say. Zhao Chunyang said, "Since the worker elder brothers are helping us in economic and technical aspects, we must work hard to produce and increase grain production to support the country's industrial construction with practical actions!"

Because we used the water mill to drive the water pump, these seventy acres of paddy fields can produce 28,000 more catties of grain than last year, increasing farmers' income by 2,800 yuan. At the same time, it can also save more than 5,000 yuan in fuel oil expenses. This incident has made me more deeply realize the relationship of the worker-peasant alliance. Only by embarking on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and only by obtaining the material and technical assistance of the working class, can we farmers completely get rid of exploitation and poverty and move towards a better and happier socialist society.

    工农联盟的生动例子编辑同志：
    咱们全村的农民都以无比兴奋的心情，感谢鞍钢弓长岭铁矿工人老大哥对我们在农业技术改革方面的无私的帮助。
    咱们后达子堡村是辽阳县十区的合作化村，全村已经组织起来七个农业生产合作社和三个互助组。今年，咱村为了进一步挖掘农业生产潜力，增加粮食产量，除了准备扩大后达子堡村稻田的亩数而外，还计划在过去根本没种过稻田的徐家和阚家两个自然村把一部分洼地种上水稻。但是，最大的困难就是没有水流来灌溉稻田，后来经我和生产委员徐永明、社员徐永祥等人研究，准备利用过去农民磨木面子的旧水磨（这种磨在解放前是借水的动力来磨木面子，供给香铺作香用，因此也叫香磨），把它修理和改造一下，用水的动力带动水泵抽水，来解决缺水问题。恰巧在这时候，县水利科又借给我们一千元的贷款。于是，我们就利用解放后农民用水磨轧棉花的齿轮和皮带轮进行安装。可是安好试验了好几回，却怎么也抽不上水来。这时，可把大伙急坏了。有的说：“干脆算了吧！”钢强农业生产合作社主任赵春阳也没有信心地说：“河水比地身低有六公尺多，怎能把水抽上来？”
    正在这个紧要关头，我忽然想起今年春节咱村农民和弓长岭铁矿工人老大哥举行工农联欢的时候，工人老大哥一再嘱咐我们，让我们有困难时去找他们援助。想到这里，我心里真像开了一扇窗户似的，大伙听说请工人老大哥来援助，精神又振作起来了。于是我和徐永祥经区委介绍到了鞍钢弓长岭铁矿（距咱村三十里路）去找党委会王书记和李矿长。王书记和李矿长听说我们要改造水磨种高产作物，表示大力支持我们，派了王有春和张宝清两位老技术员到我村去帮助设计。他们看了看水磨，发现抽不上水来的主要原因是铁齿轮太小，回矿后就用废铁给作了一个大铁齿轮和三个皮带轮。两人又不辞辛苦地冒着小雨去帮着安装起来。五月十五日这天，河水从水泵里像洪流似的涌出来了。这时，大家都乐的不知说什么好。赵春阳说：“工人老大哥这样在经济和技术方面援助我们，我们一定要以实际行动努力生产，增产粮食，支援国家工业建设！”
    由于我们利用了水磨带动水泵抽水，这七十亩稻田就可以比去年增产两万八千斤粮食，为农民增加二千八百元的收入，同时，还可以节省机油开支五千多元。通过这件事情，使我更加深切地体会到工农联盟的关系，我们农民只有走上互助合作的道路，只有取得工人阶级在物质上和技术上的援助，我们才能彻底摆脱剥削和贫困，走向美好幸福的社会主义社会。
    辽阳县后达子堡村村长　徐恩常（黄仁清记）
