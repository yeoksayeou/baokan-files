    Eliminate Waste in Grain Transportation
    Chen Zhao
    Throughout the country, millions upon millions of kilograms of grain are transferred in the transportation process every day. Ensuring that grain is not lost during transportation is an important aspect of conserving grain.
    Grain departments and transportation departments bear increasingly heavy grain transportation tasks. They have contributed to supporting national construction and ensuring the grain supply to people in various regions. However, there is a serious shortcoming in grain transportation work, which is the large amount of grain wasted. First, the amount of grain lost due to transportation accidents is quite staggering. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shanghai, approximately 180,000 kilograms of grain were lost due to transportation accidents in the first three months of this year alone. In Hunan Province, 106 grain transportation accidents occurred in 1954, resulting in a loss of 400,000 kilograms of grain. Among transportation accidents, those involving sailing boats on waterways are the most frequent and the most serious. For example, in the grain transportation on the main stream of the Yuan River in Hunan Province alone, according to incomplete statistics, there were 19 accidents of varying sizes, including broken boats and sunken boats, in the first quarter of this year, with grain losses reaching more than 77,000 kilograms. Second, a lot of grain is wasted due to poor loading, unloading, and management during grain transportation. For example, in late May of this year, Barge No. 2005 of Hangzi arrived at Nanjing Port from Hankou. When the dockworkers unloaded the grain, they found that the grain inside the boat had been soaked by rain, and 131 bags of rice had begun to deteriorate and become moldy. In addition, due to improper loading operations, one-third of the rice bags were broken, and the workers swept out 40 bags of rice from the bottom of the boat. The Jiang'an轮 (Jiang'an vessel) under the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Shipping Administration transported indica rice to Shanghai. After unloading, the workers swept out more than 300 kilograms of rice from the ship's compartments. As for grain-carrying trains and trucks, it is a common phenomenon in various places that grain is leaked, scattered, and damaged along the way. However, these losses have not attracted the attention of relevant grain departments and transportation department staff. They believe that the loss of these hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of kilograms of grain is nothing more than a small amount. This understanding is very wrong. In addition, in some places, due to unsound management systems in grain transportation, some bad elements take the opportunity to steal and damage grain, causing considerable losses to the country.
    Everyone knows that grain is the most important material of the country, and wasting grain in any way is a sin. We must not only oppose the phenomenon of wasting grain in grain processing, storage, supply, and use, but also plug the loopholes in wasting grain in transportation.
    In order to eliminate the waste of grain in transportation, grain departments and transportation departments must prevent the occurrence of grain transportation accidents with a positive attitude. Some staff in the grain departments and transportation departments attribute transportation accidents mainly to objective reasons. Some say: "Shipping is fraught with danger, and some accidents are unavoidable." This fatalistic thinking is very harmful. Under the current material conditions in our country, organizing grain transportation requires the use of some backward transportation tools (animal-powered vehicles, wooden boats, livestock, etc.), and it is difficult to completely avoid losses in the transportation process. However, if the staff of the grain departments and transportation departments adopt a highly responsible and cautious attitude towards the country's grain and take all possible safety measures, then it is entirely possible to reduce the losses in grain transportation to a minimum. In fact, in the grain transportation accidents that have occurred in various places in the past, only a very small number were caused by irresistible objective factors. Among the 23 accidents that occurred in the grain-carrying ships under the Shandong Provincial Shipping Bureau's Yellow River Office last year, only five accidents were caused by natural disasters, and the rest were caused by human factors.
    Transporting the country's grain to the places needed by the country and the people in a timely and safe manner is not only an economic task, but also a political task. If there is no close coordination and cooperation between the grain department, the transportation department, and other relevant departments, it is impossible to complete this task. But unfortunately, in some grain departments and transportation departments, there is precisely a lack of this spirit of close cooperation. Some grain workers believe that the transported grain has been insured, and the insurance company is responsible for compensation in the event of an accident. Therefore, they are indifferent to the safe transportation of grain. At the same time, some transportation units, in order to pursue the completion of task figures, disregard transportation safety, resulting in many serious transportation accidents caused by human factors. This attitude of disregarding national interests and non-cooperation is very harmful and must be resolutely corrected.
    In order to eliminate the waste of grain in transportation, grain departments and transportation departments must strengthen political and ideological work and foster a spirit of cherishing grain among all employees. In carrying out political and ideological education, all employees should be mobilized to expose the shortcomings in the grain transportation process of their units, find out the causes of these shortcomings, and study ways to overcome them. Local Party committees and governments should strengthen their leadership and supervision of grain transportation work. In the season when grain transportation is frequent, they should organize inspections of grain transportation work to help relevant units solve difficult problems and overcome grain waste.
    Various systems and measures related to grain transportation work must be effectively improved. In order to ensure the safety of transportation, before each grain shipment, a detailed inspection of the grain transportation tools and safety measures must be carried out, especially for private cars, animal-powered vehicles, and wooden boats. Attention must be paid to inspection, and if unsafe loading conditions and poor ventilation, rain protection, and mildew prevention equipment are found, improvements must be promptly urged, and risky practices must be resolutely stopped. Grain transportation involves grain, transportation, insurance, banking, public security and other departments, it is necessary to establish some necessary systems so that these departments coordinate their actions, closely connect, and shorten the schedule of grain transportation as much as possible, in order to prevent grain deterioration and loss. The security work during grain transportation must be strengthened, and the procedures and systems for grain consignment and receipt must be tightened to prevent bad elements from stealing and destroying.

    杜绝粮食运输中的浪费
    陈昭
    全国各地每天都有千千万万斤的粮食流转在运输过程中；保证粮食在运输过程中不受损失，是节约粮食的一个重要方面。
    粮食部门和运输部门担负着日益繁重的粮食运输任务，它们在支援国家建设，保证对各个地区人民的粮食供应方面，是有功绩的。但是，在粮食运输工作中还有一个严重的缺点，这就是大量的粮食浪费。首先，由于运输事故损失粮食的数量是相当惊人的。据江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、江西、上海等六个省市的不完全统计，在今年头三个月中，因运输事故损失的粮食就有十八万斤左右。湖南省一九五四年发生粮食运输事故一百零六起，损失粮食达四十万斤。运输事故中，以水上帆船发生的运输事故最多，也最严重。例如仅仅在湖南省的沅水主流的粮食运输中，据不完全的统计，今年第一季度就发生了破船、沉船等大小事故十九起，光粮食损失就达到七万七千多斤。其次，在粮食运输过程中由于粮食的装卸、管理不善，也有很多粮食被糟蹋。例如，今年五月下旬，航字二○○五号运粮驳船从汉口开到了南京港，码头工人卸粮时发现船内粮食遭雨浸湿，有一百三十一包大米已开始变质和霉烂；另外，由于装船操作不当，有三分之一的大米包被摔破，工人光从船底扫出的米，就有四十包。长江航运管理局所属的江安轮向上海运籼米，卸货后，工人又从船的夹层中扫出三百多斤米。至于运粮的火车、汽车，沿路漏撒损坏粮食，更是各地常见的现象。但是，这些损失并没有引起有关粮食部门和运输部门工作人员的注意。他们把这些成百成千成万斤的粮食损失，认为是一星半点的不算什么。这种认识是非常错误的。此外，有些地方由于粮食运输中的管理制度不健全，有些坏分子乘机盗窃和毁坏粮食，使国家遭受了不少损失。
    谁都知道，粮食是国家最重要的物资，在任何方面浪费粮食，都是罪过。我们既要在粮食加工、保管、供应、使用方面反对浪费粮食的现象，也要在运输方面堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞。
    为了消除粮食运输中的浪费现象，粮食部门和运输部门必须以积极的态度防止粮食运输事故的发生。粮食部门和运输部门中有些工作人员把运输事故主要地归于客观原因。有人说：“航运三分险，发生一些事故是不可避免的。”这种听天由命的思想是非常有害的。在我国目前的物质条件下，组织粮食运输需要使用部分的落后的运输工具（畜力车辆、木船、牲口等），要在运输过程完全避免损失是有困难的。但是，如果粮食部门和运输部门的工作人员对国家的粮食抱着高度负责和谨慎爱护的态度，采取一切可能的安全措施，那末，把粮食运输中的损失减少到最低限度，也是完全可能的。事实上，过去各地发生的粮食运输事故中，真正是来自客观方面不可抗拒的原因的只占极少数。去年山东省航运局黄河办事处所属运粮船发生的二十三次事故中，由于自然灾害造成的事故只有五次，其余都是人为的原因造成的。
    把国家的粮食及时地、安全地运到国家和人民需要的地方去，这不仅是一个经济任务，而且是一个政治任务；如果没有粮食部门、运输部门以及其他有关部门的密切配合和合作，要完成这个任务是不可能的。但是可惜的是，在某些粮食部门和运输部门中，恰恰缺乏这种密切合作的精神。有些粮食工作人员认为：运输的粮食已经保了险，发生了事故有保险公司负责赔偿，因此他们对粮食的安全运输漠不关心。同时有些运输单位为了追求完成任务的数字，竟不顾运输的安全，以致人为地造成了许多严重的运输事故。这种不顾国家利益和互不合作的态度是十分有害的，必须坚决纠正。
    为了消除粮食运输中的浪费现象，粮食部门和运输部门必须加强政治思想工作，在全体职工中树立爱护粮食的风气。在进行政治思想教育工作中，应该发动全体职工，对本单位运输粮食过程中的缺点进行揭发，找出这些缺点产生的原因，研究克服缺点的办法。各地党委和政府应加强对粮食运输工作的领导和监督，在运粮频繁的季节，应组织对粮食运输工作的检查，帮助有关的单位解决困难问题，克服粮食浪费。
    有关粮食运输工作的各项制度、措施必须切实改进。为了保证运输的安全，在每次粮食起运前，都必须对运粮的工具和安全措施进行细致的检查，特别对于私人的汽车、畜力车辆、木船，更要注意检查，发现装载情况不安全以及通风、防雨、防霉的设备不良等情况，必须及时督促改进，坚决制止冒险的做法。粮食运输牵涉到粮食、运输、保险、银行、公安等部门，必须建立一些必要的制度使这些部门协同动作，密切衔接，尽可能缩短粮食运输的日程，以便防止粮食变质和损耗。粮食运输过程中的保卫工作必须加强，同时要把粮食托运、接收等项手续、制度严密起来，防止坏分子盗窃和破坏。
