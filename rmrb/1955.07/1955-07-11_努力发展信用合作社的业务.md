Strive to Develop the Business of Credit Cooperatives

In the past year, nearly 150,000 credit cooperatives, rapidly developed in rural areas of our country, including more than 30% of peasant households, have played a role in helping peasants overcome difficulties in production and life, combating rural usury activities, and promoting and supporting the consolidation and development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

Credit cooperatives provide a new source for farmers to raise production funds in addition to state agricultural loans. It is understandable that the broad masses of peasants demand the universal establishment of credit cooperatives and the development of credit cooperative business. They have seen the benefits of credit cooperatives from their own personal experience. For example, credit cooperatives in Shanxi Province issued 10.63 million yuan in loans in the first quarter of 1955, which is almost double the amount of agricultural loans issued by the State Bank during the same period. There are many such examples in various places.

However, the mass base of credit cooperatives developed in a short period of time is still very weak. Some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of developing credit cooperative business. Nearly 20% of credit cooperatives have little or no business activity; some credit cooperatives have not implemented correct policies; and there are even more cases of poor management and unreasonable use of funds. As a result, usury is still able to continue its activities in some areas, and there is even a tendency for it to develop. In Guihu Township, Fujian, more than 200 out of more than 500 peasant households seek loans from usurers, and the highest interest rate is as high as 10%. What a serious phenomenon this is! This year, the state bank's agricultural loan quota has been used up or will soon be used up in some areas, but before the autumn harvest, many peasants are still in urgent need of general production revolving funds. Therefore, credit cooperatives should strengthen their business activities during this period, fully support agricultural production, and combat usurious exploitation. This is also essential for promoting the consolidation of credit cooperatives themselves.

At present, many credit cooperatives lack funds. This is because their deposit and loan business has not been developed. This situation must be changed rapidly. Many credit cooperative staff members overemphasize the difficulty of funds. They believe that there are no funds that can be adjusted in rural areas before the peak season, and they do not think of ways to open up sources of funds, but simply rely on bank loans to carry out business activities; some credit cooperatives only focus on a few wealthy households, and do not actively try to widely attract mass deposits. These are of course wrong. Under the condition that the state is constantly purchasing agricultural products, sideline products, and local and special products, the funds available for adjustment in rural areas are not small, even before the peak season. Credit cooperatives should concentrate the temporarily unused surplus money scattered in thousands of households. This is the fundamental way for credit cooperatives to enrich their funds. Of course, before the peak season, the law of supply and demand of rural funds is generally that deposits are less and loans are more. If some newly established credit cooperatives have serious difficulties in capital turnover, the State Bank still has the responsibility to provide loan support.

Credit cooperatives must actively absorb deposits and realize the socialist transformation of agriculture through the adjustment of rural funds. That is to say, it is necessary to actively expand the position of credit activities through the loan business of credit cooperatives, help peasants overcome difficulties in production and life, and combat, restrict, and gradually eliminate the exploitation of usury. For this purpose, the incorrect practices that exist in the loan business of credit cooperatives in various places must be effectively corrected.

It should be pointed out that some credit cooperatives, when issuing loans, do not proceed from the requirements of socialist transformation, but only consider whether the loan applicant has the ability to repay the loan, so that peasants who should have borrowed money did not borrow it, or only borrowed very little, while people who should not have borrowed money got loans; some credit cooperatives even lend funds to landlords and rich peasants to run businesses, while refusing to grant loans to poor peasants, and often ridicule poor peasants, saying that they are the "burden" of credit cooperatives, and even mobilize poor peasants who have already joined the cooperative to withdraw from the cooperative. This extremely erroneous thought and practice of excluding poor peasants organizationally and business-wise is absolutely incompatible with the Party's class policy in rural areas, and is also incompatible with the nature and tasks of credit cooperatives. Credit cooperatives are mass financial organizations of the working people. Credit cooperatives should not only not exclude and discriminate against poor peasants, but on the contrary, they must rely on poor peasants and earnestly help poor peasants.

In carrying out deposit and loan business, credit cooperatives must also pay great attention to uniting with middle peasants. The economic situation of middle peasants is better than that of poor peasants. They are the main holders of idle funds in rural areas and the main source of funds for credit cooperatives to gather. But they may also have revolving difficulties sometimes. Credit cooperatives should strengthen their education, set appropriate deposit interest rates, and guarantee credit payments. When carrying out business, many credit cooperatives use overly simple methods to mobilize middle peasants to invest more shares and deposit more money, but when middle peasants encounter difficulties, they are unwilling to give them loan support. This practice is also wrong. It will not only fail to promote the development of credit cooperative business, but will also paralyze the business of credit cooperatives, and even lead to their collapse.

In order to smoothly carry out deposit and loan business, credit cooperatives must establish a sound financial accounting system. We must never treat financial accounting work as an ordinary technical work, but must treat it as a serious political work. Many members call the accounts the "root" of the cooperative, saying that "if the root is bad, things will go wrong, and if the root is not bad, the money will not be lost." This makes sense. Experience has shown that credit cooperatives with chaotic financial accounting systems are prone to corruption, misappropriation of funds, and extravagance and waste, and will lose the trust of the masses. Their business activities cannot be supported by the members. Therefore, societies with extremely chaotic financial accounting work must be quickly rectified and cleaned up, and a public explanation should be given to the members at an appropriate time; at the same time, financial accounting work should be constantly placed under the supervision of the masses to ensure the safety of funds and ensure the smooth development of deposit and loan business.

The existing staff of credit cooperatives are mostly activists selected from among poor and middle peasants who have close relations with the masses. They have high enthusiasm for work, but their political level is low and their work experience is very little; some people cannot even cope with daily business work. When they encounter difficulties in their work that they cannot overcome, they often have negative and fearful emotions, which is a practical problem. Party organizations and agricultural banks in various places should regularly strengthen their training, education, and specific assistance so that they can truly improve in terms of policy and business.

Credit cooperation is an important aspect of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture. The current situation of the business stagnation of many credit cooperatives urgently needs to be changed. The leading organs at the county level should reasonably arrange credit cooperative work within the central work of the countryside in a unified manner, and strengthen specific leadership over credit cooperative work. The key to improving leadership depends on the leadership at the district level. The experience of many regions has proven that as long as we earnestly improve and strengthen the leadership of credit cooperative work, the work of credit cooperatives will have a great improvement. It can be believed that under the strong leadership of the Party's organizations at all levels, under the condition that the policy level and work ability of the staff of credit cooperatives are constantly improved, it is entirely possible to further develop the business of credit cooperatives before this year's autumn harvest.

### 努力发展信用合作社的业务

    努力发展信用合作社的业务
    一年以来，我国农村中迅速发展起来的包括百分之三十以上农户的近十五万个信用合作社，帮助农民克服生产和生活的困难，打击农村高利贷活动，促进和支持农业生产互助合作组织的巩固和发展，起了一定的作用。
    信用合作社使广大农民在国家农业贷款以外，获得了一个新的筹措生产资金的源泉。广大农民要求普遍建立信用合作社，发展信用合作社的业务，这是可以理解的。他们从自己亲身的经验中看到了信用合作社的好处。例如山西省的信用合作社在一九五五年第一季度放出的贷款就有一千零六十三万元，比国家银行在同时期发放的农业贷款还多了将近一倍。像这样的例子各地都有许多。
    但是，在短期内发展起来的信用合作社的群众基础还是很薄弱的。某些干部对开展信用合作社业务的重要性认识还很不够。有将近百分之二十的信用合作社很少甚至根本没有业务活动；有些信用合作社没有贯彻正确的方针政策；至于经营管理不善、资金运用不合理的就更多了。以致有些地区高利贷仍然能够继续活动，甚至还有发展的趋势。福建龟湖乡五百多户农民，就有二百多户向高利贷者求借，利息最高的竟达十分。这是多么严重的现象！今年国家银行的农贷指标在一部分地区已经放完或将要放完，但在秋收以前，许多农民对一般性生产周转资金的需要还很迫切。因此，信用合作社在这个期间应该加强业务活动，全力支持农业生产，打击高利贷剥削。这对促进信用合作社本身的巩固也是十分必要的。
    现在许多信用合作社的资金是不足的。这是因为它们的存放款业务没有开展。这种状况必须迅速改变过来。不少信用合作社的工作人员过分强调资金困难。他们认为在农村旺季以前，农村没有可以调剂的资金，他们不想办法开辟资金来源，而单纯依赖银行的贷款来进行业务活动；有些信用合作社只把眼睛放在少数富裕户身上，而不积极设法广泛吸收群众存款。这些当然是错误的。在国家不断收购农产品、副业产品和土产品、特产品的条件下，农村中可供调剂的资金，即使在旺季以前也是不小的。信用合作社应该把分散在千门万户的暂时不用的余钱集中起来。这是信用合作社充实资金的根本办法。当然，旺季以前农村资金供求规律一般是存入少、贷出多，一部分新建立的信用合作社在资金周转上如果发生了严重的困难，国家银行还是有责任给予贷款支持的。
    信用合作社必须积极吸收存款，通过农村资金的调剂，实现对农业的社会主义改造。这就是说，要通过信用合作社的贷款业务积极扩大信贷活动的阵地，帮助农民克服生产和生活上的困难，打击、限制和逐步消灭高利贷的剥削。为了这个目的，各地对于信用合作社在贷款业务中存在着的不正确的做法必须加以切实的纠正。
    应该指出，有的信用合作社在放款的时候，不从社会主义改造的要求出发，而只考虑贷款户有无还款能力，以致应该借款的农民没有借到，或者只借到很少的贷款，不应该借款的人却借到了贷款；有的信用合作社甚至把资金贷给地主、富农经营商业，而拒绝对贫农贷款，并且常常讽刺贫农，说他们是信用合作社的“包袱”，甚至动员已经入社的贫农退社。这种在组织上、业务上排斥贫农的极端错误的思想和作法，同党在农村的阶级政策是决不相容的，同信用合作社的性质、任务也是决不相容的。信用合作社是劳动人民的群众性的金融组织。信用合作社不但不应该排斥和歧视贫农，相反的，它必须依靠贫农，认真帮助贫农。
    信用合作社在开展存放款业务中，还必须十分注意团结中农。中农的经济情况比贫农好，他们是农村中闲散资金的主要持有者，是信用合作社聚集资金的主要来源。但他们有时也会发生周转性的困难。信用合作社应该加强对他们的教育，把存款利息规定得适当，并保证支付信用。有不少信用合作社在开展业务的时候，用过于简单的方式动员中农多入股、多存款，而当中农发生困难的时候，却不愿意给他们以贷款支持。这种做法同样是错误的。它不仅不能促进信用合作社业务的开展，而且会使信用合作社的业务陷于瘫痪，甚至有垮台的危险。
    为了顺利地开展存款放款业务，信用合作社必须建立健全的财务会计制度。我们绝不可把财务会计工作当成一项普通的技术工作，而必须把它当成一项严肃的政治工作来做。很多社员都把账目叫作合作社的“根”，说“根子坏了就要坏事，根子不坏就丢不了款”。这是有道理的。经验证明，哪些信用合作社的财务会计制度混乱，哪些信用合作社就会发生贪污、挪用款项和铺张浪费的现象，就会失去群众的信任，它的业务活动就不能得到社员群众的支持。因此，对于财务会计工作十分混乱的社，必须迅速加以整顿、清理，并在适当时机向社员进行公开的交代；同时还应该把财务会计工作经常放在群众的监督之下，以保障资金的安全，保证存、放款业务的顺利开展。
    信用合作社现有的工作人员，多是从贫农中农当中选拔出来的和群众关系较密切的积极分子。他们的工作热情很高，但政治水平较低，工作经验也很少；有些人甚至不能应付日常的业务工作。他们在工作中遇到困难无法克服的时候，就常常产生消极畏难情绪，这是一个实际问题。各地的党组织和农业银行要经常加强对他们的培养、教育和具体帮助，使他们能够在政策和业务上切实有所提高。
    信用合作是对农业实行社会主义改造的一个重要方面。许多信用合作社的业务停顿的现状亟应改变。县一级的领导机关要合理地把信用合作工作统一安排在农村中心工作之内，并加强对信用合作工作的具体领导。改善领导的关键决定于区一级的领导。不少地区的经验证明，只要我们认真改善和加强对信用合作社工作的领导，信用合作社的工作就会有很大的起色。可以相信，在党的各级组织的坚强的领导下，在信用合作社的工作人员的政策水平和工作能力不断提高的条件下，在今年秋收以前进一步发展信用合作社的业务是完全可能的。
