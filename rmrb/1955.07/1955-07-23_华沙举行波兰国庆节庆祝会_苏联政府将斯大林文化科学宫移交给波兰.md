Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, on the eve of National Day (July 22nd), the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic held a grand celebration at the Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin in Warsaw.

The leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the state, including Bierut, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, representatives of various political parties and social organizations, figures from the scientific and cultural fields, and advanced workers attended the celebration.

Also present were government delegations from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Poland.

Representatives of Soviet and Polish construction workers who participated in the construction of the Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin also attended the celebration.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Bierut, delivered the opening speech.

Bierut said that the fact that many representatives of countries allied with Poland are participating in the celebration of Polish National Day demonstrates the sympathy and solidarity felt today towards Poland by countries liberated from the shackles of capitalism. We express our deep gratitude for this fraternal feeling, which will encourage us in our further efforts to build socialism in our country.

Today, we are gathering in the magnificent hall of the Palace of Culture and Science, built through the enthusiastic work and selfless efforts of the builders of the powerful Soviet Union, in the hall of the Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin. This is a noble example of the new relationship of friendship and eternal friendship between Poland and the first socialist country in the world.

Only three years ago, in the area where this magnificent Palace of Culture and Science stands today, were the ruins of houses burned down by German fascists. Today, when all peace-loving people are fighting against the danger of a new war, against the revival of German militarism, and against turning West Germany into a hotbed of a new war, this must also be remembered.

The politicians of the four major powers are currently holding a meeting in Geneva, seeking in friendly negotiations methods leading to a peaceful resolution of disputes, easing international tensions, and strengthening the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

The Polish people, who have been severely tested in the past two world wars, are following the progress of the Geneva Conference with keen interest and fervently hope that the representatives participating in the meeting will achieve success in their work, which is so important to mankind.

Next, Chairman of the Council of State, Zawadzki, spoke at the meeting.

Head of the Soviet government delegation Suslov, Head of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China He Long, and heads of the government delegations of other People's Democratic countries also spoke at the meeting.

Finally, a rich and colorful artistic program was performed.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: The opening and handover ceremony of the great gift from the Soviet people to the Polish people—the Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin—was held in Warsaw on the 21st.

Tens of thousands of Warsaw residents and representatives from all walks of life in the Polish capital gathered in the square in front of the Palace.

The leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the state, including Bierut, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz, attended the ceremony.

The Soviet government delegation, led by member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Suslov, also attended the ceremony.

Also present at the ceremony were government delegations from the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Poland.

Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Ponomarenko, on behalf of the Soviet government, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, on behalf of the Polish government, signed the protocol on the Soviet Socialist Republics' government's gratuitous transfer of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw to the government of the Polish People's Republic. Subsequently, Ponomarenko delivered a speech and, amidst stormy applause from the audience, handed the key to the Palace of Culture and Science to Cyrankiewicz.

Cyrankiewicz delivered a reply. The speeches of both were frequently interrupted by heartfelt applause and cheers for the unbreakable friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples.

After Cyrankiewicz cut the ribbon, those present immediately toured the interior of this magnificent building.

    华沙举行波兰国庆节庆祝会
    苏联政府将斯大林文化科学宫移交给波兰
    新华社华沙二十二日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰人民共和国部长会议在国庆节（二十二日）前夕，在华沙斯大林文化科学宫举行了盛大的庆祝会。
    波兰统一工人党和国家的领导人贝鲁特、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等，各个政党和社会团体的代表、科学文化界人士和先进工作者都出席了庆祝会。
    到会的还有苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各人民民主国家的政府代表团以及各国驻波兰的外交使节。
    参加斯大林文化科学宫建筑工作的苏联和波兰建筑工作者的代表也参加了庆祝会。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特致开会词。
    贝鲁特说，同波兰结成同盟的各国的许多代表参加庆祝波兰国庆节这一事实表现了从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的各国今天对波兰的同情和团结一致的感情。我们对这种兄弟般的感情表示深深的感谢，这种感情将使我们在我国建设社会主义的进一步努力中得到鼓励。
    我们今天在强大的苏联的建筑者们的热情的工作和无私的努力而建筑起来的文化科学宫的华丽的大厅里，在以斯大林的名字命名的文化科学宫的大厅里举行集会。这是波兰和世界上第一个社会主义国家之间的友好和永恒的友谊的新关系的一种崇高的范例。
    仅仅在三年前，在今天这个华丽的文化科学宫所在的地区，是德国法西斯分子所烧毁的房屋的残垣断壁。今天，当所有爱好和平的人民为反对新战争的危险、反对德国军国主义复活和反对把西德变成为新战争的温床而斗争的时候，也必须记住这一点。
    四大国的政治家们目前在日内瓦举行会议，他们在友好的谈判中寻求导向和平解决争执问题、缓和国际局势和加强不同社会制度的国家的和平共处的方法。
    在过去两次世界大战中受到非常严重的考验的波兰人民怀着深切的兴趣注视着日内瓦会议的进程，并且热烈地希望参加会议的代表在他们的对人类是如此重要的工作中获得成功。
    接着，国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基在会上讲了话。
    苏联政府代表团团长苏斯洛夫、中华人民共和国政府代表团团长贺龙和其他各人民民主国家政府代表团团长都在会上讲了话。
    最后表演了丰富多采的艺术节目。
    新华社华沙二十二日电　苏联人民赠给波兰人民的伟大礼物——斯大林文化科学宫的开放和移交仪式二十一日在华沙举行。
    成千上万的华沙居民和波兰首都社会各界的代表都聚集在宫前的广场上。
    参加仪式的有波兰统一工人党和国家的领导人贝鲁特、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等。
    由苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏共中央书记苏斯洛夫率领的苏联政府代表团也参加了这次仪式。
    参加仪式的还有中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的政府代表团，以及各国驻波兰的外交使节。
    苏联驻波兰大使波诺马连科代表苏联政府、波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹代表波兰政府签署了关于苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府把在华沙的文化科学宫大厦无偿移交波兰人民共和国政府的议定书。随后，波诺马连科发表了演说，并在听众的暴风雨般的掌声中把文化科学宫的钥匙交给了西伦凯维兹。
    西伦凯维兹致答词。他们两人的演说都不时被为波兰和苏联两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊而发出的衷心的鼓掌和欢呼所打断。
    西伦凯维兹剪彩后，到会者随即到这座宏伟的大厦内部参观。
