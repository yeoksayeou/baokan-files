Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th (TASS): The Soviet Peace Committee issued a communiqué regarding the signature campaign in the Soviet Union for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the Peoples of the World Against the Preparation for Atomic War."

The communiqué pointed out: The signature campaign in the Soviet Union was conducted amidst a great political and labor upsurge. During the campaign, hundreds of thousands of meetings were held in factories, collective farms, schools, and institutions. A total of 122,354,604 Soviet citizens signed the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World," a number far exceeding the number of signatures on the Stockholm Appeal and the World Peace Council's appeal for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

This campaign vividly demonstrates that the Soviet people are closely united around their government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At the signature rallies, Soviet men and women declared their unanimous support for all diplomatic measures taken by the Soviet government to ease international tensions.

The communiqué stated: Soviet men and women, like all ordinary people in the world, hope to prevent the outbreak of another world war and to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. In the course of the campaign, the Soviet people reaffirmed their determination to continue to cooperate with all peace-loving forces in the world to strive for the realization of these lofty ideals. The results of the campaign show the enthusiastic support of the entire Soviet people for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the Peoples of the World," and demonstrate their firm determination to prevent atomic war and to work to ease world tensions.
