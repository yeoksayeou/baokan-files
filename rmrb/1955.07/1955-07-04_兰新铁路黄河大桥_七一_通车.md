　　The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge was completed and opened to traffic on July 1st. On that afternoon, a decorated train passed over the bridge for the first time amidst cheers from the crowd. From now on, trains carrying crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield and goods supporting the construction of Xinjiang can be transported back and forth across the bridge. The completion of the main Yellow River Bridge on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will further improve transportation efficiency and ensure traffic safety. The original temporary bridge was a wooden frame with steel beams, and the speed was limited to 10 kilometers per hour. The completed main bridge now meets modern bridge standards, and the speed is not restricted.

　　Construction of the Yellow River Bridge began on April 1, 1954. Over the past year, the bridge-building workers have twice overcome floods. After the Yellow River froze in winter, workers chipped away at the ice in the severe cold of minus 20 degrees, speeding up the construction of the bridge piers day and night. By the time the river began to rise this year, all the bridge piers and abutments were already standing on the river surface; then, the bridge erectors spent three and a half days erecting all the steel beams of the bridge.

　　During the construction of the Yellow River Bridge, it received support from all over the country. Workers at the Shenyang Bridge Factory manufactured giant steel beams for the bridge project in a timely manner. North China, Central South China, and Northeast China transported large amounts of cement, wood, and various steel materials. Wuhan and other places sent a group of divers and shipbuilders to support the project. Farmers on both sides of the Yellow River also contributed dozens of sheepskin rafts to help workers transport materials.

### 兰新铁路黄河大桥“七一”通车

　　兰新铁路黄河大桥“七一”通车
    兰新铁路黄河大桥，已经在七月一日落成通车。当天下午，一列扎彩的火车在群众欢呼中，第一次通过了这座大桥。从此以后，装载玉门油矿原油和装载支援建设新疆的货物的列车，就可通过大桥往来运输。兰新铁路黄河正桥的竣工，将进一步提高运输效率和保证行车安全。原来的便桥是木架钢梁，行车速度限制在每小时十公里以内，现在完工的这座正桥，符合现代化桥梁标准，行车速度不受限制。
      黄河大桥是一九五四年四月一日动工兴建的。一年多来，修桥职工曾两次战胜了洪水。冬季黄河封冻后，工人们曾在零下二十度的严寒里，凿去冰块，日夜加紧修筑桥墩。到今年河水开始上涨时，大桥的全部桥墩和桥台已经屹立在河面上；接着，架桥工人用三天半时间架设好了大桥的全部钢梁。
    在黄河大桥修筑过程中，得到了全国各地的支援，沈阳桥梁厂工人为大桥工程及时地制造了巨型钢梁，华北、中南、东北等地运来了大量的水泥、木料和各种钢材，武汉等地派了一批潜水工和造船工前来支援，黄河两岸的农民也拿出几十个羊皮筏子帮助工人运输材料。
