Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 10th that people from all walks of life in Vietnam strongly condemned the Ngo Dinh Diem regime for illegally arresting people who had participated in the movement to assist victims of the armed conflict in South Vietnam, as well as suppressing a recent demonstration in Saigon. The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front pointed out in a letter to the people of the South on July 8th that these suppression measures prove that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are afraid of justice and afraid of the unity and indestructible strength of the people.

The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace stated in a statement issued on July 7th: We demand that the Southern authorities restore the freedom of all those arrested, guarantee the lives and property and democratic freedoms of the residents, and respect the people's wishes by consulting with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of general elections on the established date.

The Vietnam National Farmers' Liaison Committee also passed a resolution protesting the above-mentioned terrorist measures of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime and demanding the immediate release of those arrested in Saigon. The resolution pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has been oppressing the residents of the South, placing them in poverty and suffering. The resolution also called on farmers in the North to promote the production increase movement and land reform to support the struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

    越南人民谴责吴庭艳政权的恐怖措施
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南通讯社十日讯：越南各阶层人民强烈谴责吴庭艳政权非法逮捕曾参加援助在越南南方武装冲突中受难者运动的人士以及镇压最近在西贡举行的一次游行示威的行动。越南国民联合战线全国委员会在七月八日给南方人民的一封信中指出，这些镇压措施证明，美国和吴庭艳集团害怕正义，害怕人民的团结和不可摧毁的力量。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会在七月七日发表的一项声明中说：我们要求南方当局恢复一切被捕的人的自由，保证居民的生命财产和民主自由，并且尊重人民的愿望而同越南民主共和国政府在既定的日期就普选问题进行协商。
    越南全国农民联络委员会也作出一项决议，对吴庭艳政权的上述的恐怖措施表示抗议，并要求立即释放在西贡被捕的人。决议指出，吴庭艳集团一直在压迫南方的居民，并且把他们置于贫困和痛苦之中。决议还号召北方农民推进增产运动和土地改革以支持南越人民的斗争。
