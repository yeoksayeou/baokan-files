    Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals Should Not Be Treated with "Indifference"
    To the Editors:

    Since February of this year, the Harbin Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, China Youth Daily, and Heavy Industry Communications, among other newspapers and periodicals, have raised eleven criticisms concerning shortcomings and errors in the work of the Metal Structure Engineering Company under the Building Materials Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. However, this company has not conducted a single serious examination of any of these criticisms. Is it because these criticisms in the newspapers and periodicals are all incorrect? No, the newspapers and periodicals conducted repeated investigations and verified the facts before publishing these criticisms. The problem lies in the fact that the leading staff of this company lacks a correct attitude towards criticism.

    For example, on February 11th, the Harbin Daily published an article criticizing the shortcomings in the work of the Harbin Electric Welding School under the company. The leading personnel of this company were very dissatisfied. To resolve this issue, on March 28th, the Harbin Daily sent representatives, along with reporters from the Heilongjiang Daily and China Youth Daily, to talk to the Party Committee Secretary of the company. The Party Committee Secretary, Bi Yongtai, refused to meet them, using being busy as an excuse. At the Party Committee meeting on April 7th, Bi Yongtai even said with dissatisfaction: "We will never run such a school again..." As a result, the Harbin Daily published an article on April 24th entitled "Harbin Electric Welding School Should Correctly Treat Criticism," and the China Youth Daily published a criticism on May 19th entitled "Is This Even a School?" demanding that the company's leaders quickly correct their attitude towards criticism, seriously address the issues at the Harbin Electric Welding School, and make a public self-criticism in the newspapers. But until now, the company's leaders have not made any self-criticism to the newspaper offices.

    As another example, on February 19th, the Heilongjiang Daily published a criticism entitled "The Bitter Fruit of Blind Complacency – A Record of a Major Rework Quality Accident in the Metal Structure Company's Installation Team," and also published a commentary pointing out that the most fundamental reason for this accident was the serious pride and complacency of the company's leaders, especially the leaders of the installation team. Regarding this criticism, the company only issued a very superficial "Inspection Report" from the Party Committee; and the pride and complacency of certain leaders were not seriously criticized at all, nor were the specific negligent personnel subjected to the criticism they deserved.

    As yet another example, on February 17th, the Heilongjiang Daily published an article entitled "The Fate of a Crane," criticizing that the company had a crane worth more than 200,000 yuan that was transported from Fushun to Harbin at the end of last August and left unattended for seven months. But now, four or five months have passed, and this valuable crane is still left idle, with no one responsible, and is in terrible condition.

    In addition, on April 24th, the Harbin Daily criticized the company for violating financial regulations and defrauding state funds. On March 31st, the Harbin Daily's "Economic Work Review" criticized the company for not supporting the employees' savings initiatives, Heavy Industry Communications issue 12 criticized the company for the continuous occurrence of safety accidents, and issue 15 criticized the company for failing to complete its first-quarter plan... But despite these criticisms, the company has not seriously examined and improved its work based on them.

    It is not difficult to imagine how this company treats bottom-up criticism from the masses, given their attitude of indifference towards criticism in newspapers and periodicals. I believe that the Building Materials Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry should conduct a serious investigation and deal with the company's error of resisting criticism from newspapers and periodicals.
                                                                                                        Guan Qiuxi

### 不应该用“置之不理”的态度对待报刊批评

    不应该用“置之不理”的态度对待报刊批评编辑同志：
    从今年二月以来，哈尔滨日报、黑龙江日报、中国青年报和重工业通讯等报刊对重工业部建筑材料工业管理局金属结构工程公司工作中的缺点和错误，先后提出了十一次批评。但是，这个公司对所有这些批评，一次也没有进行认真的检查。是不是因为报刊上的这些批评都不正确呢？不，报刊发表这些批评以前，都是经过反复调查，核对事实的。问题在于这个公司的领导工作人员缺乏正确对待批评的态度。
    例如，二月十一日哈尔滨日报发表了一篇稿件，批评这个公司所属哈尔滨电焊学校工作中的缺点。这个公司的领导人员就很不满意。为了解决这个问题，哈尔滨日报在三月二十八日派人会同黑龙江日报和中国青年报的记者一起去找这个公司的党委书记谈话。党委书记毕永太借口工作忙，拒绝接见。在四月七日的党委会议上，毕永太还不满地说：“今后再也不办这样的学校了……。”因此，哈尔滨日报在四月二十四日发表了“哈尔滨电焊学校应该正确对待批评”的稿件，中国青年报在五月十九日发表了“这也是一所学校吗”的批评，要求公司领导人员迅速端正对待批评的态度，严肃处理哈尔滨电焊学校的问题，并在报纸上作公开检讨。但是直到现在，这个公司的领导人员并没有向报社作过检讨。
    又如，二月十九日黑龙江日报发表了“盲目自满情绪所造成的恶果——记金属结构公司安装队发生的重大返工质量事故”的批评，同时还发表评论，指出造成这次事故的最根本的原因，是这个公司的领导人员，特别是安装队的领导人员，有着严重的骄傲自满情绪。对于这个批评，这个公司只是由党委出面写了一个很不深刻的“检查报告”；而对于某些领导人员的骄傲自满情绪，根本没有进行严肃的批判，对具体的失职人员，也没有进行应有的批评。
    再如，二月十七日黑龙江日报发表了“一台吊车的命运”的稿件，批评这个公司有一台价值二十多万元的吊车，从去年八月末由抚顺运到哈尔滨，经过七个月没人管。可是到现在已经过了四、五个月了，这台贵重的吊车还是闲放着，无人负责，弄得体无完肤。
    此外，四月二十四日哈尔滨日报曾批评这个公司违反财政制度、骗取国家资金等问题，三月三十一日哈尔滨日报“经济工作述评”又批评了这个公司不支持职工的节约倡议，重工业通讯十二期批评了这个公司安全事故不断发生的现象，十五期又批评了这个公司第一季度完不成计划……。但是批评尽管批评，这个公司并没有根据这些批评认真地检查和改进工作。
    这个公司对待报刊的批评采取这样置之不理的态度，不难想像，他们对待来自群众的自下而上的批评将会如何了。我认为，重工业部建筑材料工业局应该对这个公司抗拒报刊批评的错误进行严肃的检查和处理。　管秋喜
