How Qiqihar Machinery Factory Utilizes the Role of Advanced Groups
By our reporter Jin Yukun

    The Xing Shouyuan group of the local state-owned Qiqihar Machinery Factory changed backward manual operations to semi-mechanized operations, increasing labor productivity by more than double. On the basis of increasing labor productivity, they also consciously broke backward norms and created higher norms. How to expand the role of the Xing Shouyuan advanced group in production? This has become a problem that the leading staff of the Qiqihar Machinery Factory urgently needs to solve.

    The Qiqihar Machinery Factory has not yet implemented a work plan, and production has long been in a state of serious imbalance. The emergence of the Xing Shouyuan group, the leap forward in advanced links, and the failure of backward links to improve accordingly have further increased the imbalance and chaos in production, making it impossible to give full play to the role of advanced groups. The weak links that often affect the normal production of the Xing Shouyuan group are, first of all, the steelmaking workshop, which produces a large number of defective agricultural steel parts and delivers them late. The second is the drilling machine, which cannot meet the needs of assembly due to insufficient equipment and personnel.

    The Xing Shouyuan group is the final process in the factory (assembly process). If there is any discrepancy in the factory's production organization, processing quality, or raw material supply, it will disrupt the normal production of the Xing Shouyuan group. Last year, due to the frequent existence of such factors, the Xing Shouyuan group was under the threat of failing to complete its plan throughout the year. In the first quarter of this year, the Xing Shouyuan group only completed 96 percent of its plan; the April plan was also completed in a rush in the last eight days. It is estimated that if the Xing Shouyuan group can start normal installation at the beginning of the month, it can not only complete the plan, but also increase the assembly volume by half to one time.

    It is difficult to give full play to the role of advanced production groups without overcoming the contradiction between advanced production groups and backward enterprise management. If the factory wants to cultivate and consolidate the Xing Shouyuan group and give full play to its role, it must actively improve its management work. Now, the factory's leaders are doing this. For example, the technical problems of the steelmaking workshop have been initially solved, and the weak production capacity of drilling machines has also been strengthened due to the adjustment of equipment and labor organization. At the same time, it has begun to solve the fundamental problems in enterprise management by strengthening plan management, which has made the situation in May start to improve.

    In the past, when many factories cultivated advanced groups, due to the weakness of political and ideological work, the advanced groups were often in a very isolated state. The situation of the Xing Shouyuan group was the same at the beginning. While other factories were learning from the Xing Shouyuan group, some people in the factory and workshop where the Xing Shouyuan group was located deliberately looked for or exaggerated the "backwardness" of the Xing Shouyuan group, saying that "this group has piles of defective products, which are all thrown into pits and buried" (this was not the case). Some cadres did not actively solve the supply of components, but watched the difficulties of the advanced groups with cold eyes. Some people even attacked the Xing Shouyuan group behind their backs as "cheating for honors," in order to arouse everyone's dissatisfaction. The factory's party organization did not promptly criticize this erroneous thinking. In addition, in its propaganda work, the factory's party organization did not deeply promote the advanced thinking of the Xing Shouyuan group, but exaggerated certain specific facts, such as the Xing Shouyuan group did not complete two years' tasks in one year, but promoted it as completing two years' tasks in one year. As a result, some people asked: They still have a year's worth of tasks left there, why can't we see it? Any achievement of Xing Shouyuan himself or their group was publicized everywhere, while some groups that learned from the experience of the Xing Shouyuan group had innovations and made achievements in completing the national plan were ignored. This aroused the dissatisfaction of some employees, isolated the advanced groups from the masses, and fostered the mentality of some people not being willing to learn from advanced experience. It is necessary to change this erroneous attitude towards advanced groups and general groups in order to enable advanced groups to lead everyone to work better, and at the same time enable advanced groups to continue to move forward under the supervision of the masses. Only in this way can we truly lead the laggards and make them catch up with the advanced, so as to achieve universal improvement.

    The party organization of the Qiqihar Machinery Factory promptly corrected the shortcomings in the propaganda work, criticized various erroneous ideas, pointed out that the achievements of the Xing Shouyuan group were inseparable from the support of various groups, and without the completion of the tasks in the previous process, there would be no completion of the tasks of the Xing Shouyuan group. Therefore, the achievements of the Xing Shouyuan group are the achievements of the collective, and the glory of the Xing Shouyuan group is also the honor of the collective. Appropriate criticisms were also given to the shortcomings of the Xing Shouyuan group. Groups that had made some achievements in learning from the Xing Shouyuan group were also praised and encouraged, and the advanced experiences of the better groups were summarized and promoted. As a result, the enthusiasm of the employees in learning from the Xing Shouyuan group increased, and the groups that originally learned the worst became very good at learning. Fifty percent of the groups in the factory have achieved practical results in learning, which has played a great role in production.

    Strengthening the internal unity of advanced groups is of great significance to giving play to their advanced role. And the key to strengthening unity lies in the fact that advanced workers must correctly get along with workers who have more serious shortcomings or mistakes, and the former should give the latter the same warm help as comrades. But the Xing Shouyuan group was not like this at the beginning. In this group, there was a worker named Wang Gongliang, who was originally a capable member of the Youth League and had always been active in production. After 1953, due to unplanned spending in life, eating and using well, and borrowing money everywhere, he often ended up with no money to buy meal tickets. This chaotic phenomenon in life also affected the mood of production, which was sometimes hot and sometimes cold. Xing Shouyuan always believed that "this person is too backward" and "there is no way to help him," and his attitude towards him was also very impatient; Wang Gongliang was also a little afraid when he saw Xing Shouyuan. The young workers in the group also wanted to help Wang Gongliang at the beginning, but there were shortcomings in the method. In all publicity and written materials, he was taken as the "typical" example whenever backwardness was mentioned. When he began to realize his mistakes and showed progress in production, he did not receive enthusiastic support and encouragement. Wang Gongliang was excluded from the group for a long time, and no one ate, slept, or played with him. His ideological burden became heavier and heavier. He only sighed and did not speak at the meeting, thinking that no one would believe him no matter how well he did! This matter aroused the attention of the factory's party organization. Under the specific leadership of the party organization, the Communist Party members and other members of the Youth League in the Xing Shouyuan group examined the shortcomings in their past attitudes towards Wang Gongliang, and ideologically clarified the issue of having to correctly treat comrades with shortcomings and mistakes. Everyone then improved their relationship with Wang Gongliang.

    In general, the Qiqihar Machinery Factory's work in cultivating the Xing Shouyuan advanced group is normal and healthy, and with the emergence of advanced groups, it is also actively working to continuously overcome weak links and improve enterprise management. However, the development of production and work puts higher and stricter demands on the leading comrades of the enterprise. It is hoped that the leading comrades of this factory will work harder to improve their leadership level and better give play to the role of advanced groups and this enterprise.

　　齐齐哈尔机械厂怎样发挥先进小组的作用
　　本报记者　金雨困
    地方国营齐齐哈尔机械厂邢守元小组，把落后的手工操作改为半机械化操作，使劳动生产率提高一倍以上。他们并在提高劳动生产率的基础上，自觉地打破了落后定额，创造了更高的定额。怎样扩大邢守元先进小组在生产上的作用呢？这已成为齐齐哈尔机械厂领导工作人员急需解决的一个问题了。
    齐齐哈尔机械厂至今还没有推行作业计划，生产长期处于严重的不均衡状态。而邢守元小组的出现，先进环节的跃进，落后环节不能相应提高，这更增加了生产的不均衡和混乱状态，使先进小组的作用不能发挥。经常影响邢守元小组正常生产的薄弱环节，首先是炼钢车间，它生产的农具钢件废品多，交货迟缓。其次是钻床，因设备和人员的不足而不能满足装配的需要。
    邢守元小组是全厂最后一道工序（装配工序）。全厂无论在生产组织、加工质量、原材料供应有一点不合拍，都会破坏邢守元小组的正常生产。去年，因这种因素经常存在，邢守元小组就整年处于完不成计划的威胁中。今年第一季度，邢守元小组仅完成了计划的百分之九十六；四月份的计划也是在最后八天中才突击完成的。据估计，如果邢守元小组能在月初就开始正常的安装，不仅可以完成计划，而且装配量还可提高半倍到一倍。
    不克服先进的生产小组跟企业管理落后之间的矛盾，要发挥先进的生产小组的作用是困难的。工厂要培养和巩固邢守元小组，要发挥它的作用，就必须积极改进管理工作。现在，工厂的领导人员也这样做了。例如炼钢车间的技术问题已初步解决，钻床生产能力薄弱亦因设备和劳动组织的调整而加强。同时已开始从加强计划管理来解决企业管理上的根本问题，这就使五月份的情况开始好转。
    过去许多工厂在培养先进小组时，由于政治思想工作薄弱，往往使先进小组处于很孤立的状态。邢守元小组开始时的情况也是这样。当其它工厂正在向邢守元小组学习的时候，邢守元小组所在的工厂和车间里，却有人故意寻找或夸大邢守元小组的
  “落后”，说“这个小组废品成堆，都丢到坑里埋了起来”（事实不是这样）。有的干部不积极解决部件的供应，而冷眼旁观先进小组的困难。有的人甚至在背后攻击邢守元小组是“骗取荣誉”，借此引起大家的不满。对这种错误的思想，工厂的党组织并没有及时地进行批判。另外，工厂的党组织在宣传工作上，没有深入宣传邢守元小组的先进思想，而夸大了某些具体事实，如邢守元小组并没有一年完成两年任务，却宣传为一年完成了两年任务。于是有的人就问：他们还有一年任务搁在那里，怎么看不见？对邢守元个人或他们的小组，一有点成绩就到处宣扬，而对一些学习邢守元小组的经验有创造，在完成国家计划方面有成绩的小组，则不理不睬。这就引起某些职工的不满，也使先进小组脱离群众，助长部分人不虚心学习先进经验的情绪。必须改变这样对待先进小组和一般小组的错误态度，才能使先进小组带动大家工作得更好，同时也使先进小组在群众的督促下不断前进。这样才能真正的带动落后者，使其赶上先进者，达到普遍提高的目的。
    齐齐哈尔机械厂的党组织及时改正了宣传工作中的缺点，批判了各种错误思想，指出邢守元小组的成就是跟各小组的支援分不开的，没有前道工序的完成任务，就不可能有邢守元小组的完成任务，因此邢守元小组的成就就是集体的成就，邢守元小组的光荣也就是集体的荣誉。对邢守元小组的缺点也给予恰当的批评。对学习邢守元小组有一点成绩的小组也给予表扬鼓励，并将较好的小组的先进经验进行了总结和推广，结果，职工学习邢守元小组的劲头大了，原来学习最不好的小组变成学习很好的小组。全厂已有百分之五十的小组在学习中有了实际成果，对生产起了很大作用。
    加强先进小组内部的团结，对发挥它的先进作用有很大的意义。而加强团结的关键又在于先进工人要正确地同有较严重缺点或错误的工人相处，前者要给后者以同志般的热情帮助。但是邢守元小组在开始的时候，却不是这样。在这个小组里，有一个工人叫王宫良，本是一个能干的青年团员，生产一直很积极，一九五三年以后由于生活上花钱无计划，好吃好用，到处借债，经常弄得连饭票都没有钱买，这种生活上的混乱现象也影响到生产情绪时热时冷。邢守元一直认为“这个人太落后”、“没有办法可以帮助他”，对他的态度也很急躁；王宫良一见邢守元也有点害怕。组里的青年工人开始时也想来帮助王宫良，但在方法上有缺点，在一切宣传和文字材料中，凡是谈到落后时都以他为“典型”。当他对自己的错误开始有了认识并在生产中表现进步时，也得不到热情的支持和鼓励。王宫良在小组里长期被排斥，甚至吃饭、睡觉、游玩都没人跟他一起。他的思想包袱越来越重，开会时只叹气不讲话，以为干得再好也不会有人相信他了！这件事引起了工厂党组织的注意。在党组织的具体领导下，邢守元小组的共产党员和其他青年团员检查了过去对待王宫良的态度上的缺点，并在思想上明确认识了必须正确对待有缺点和错误的同志这个问题。大家随即改进了同王宫良的关系。
    齐齐哈尔机械厂对于邢守元先进小组的培养工作一般来说还是正常和健康的，随着先进小组的出现，对不断克服薄弱环节和提高企业管理水平等工作也还是积极的。但生产和工作的发展，对企业的领导同志提出的要求愈来愈高，也愈来愈严格了，希望这个厂的领导同志更加兢兢业业地提高自己的领导水平，更好地发挥先进小组和本企业的作用。
