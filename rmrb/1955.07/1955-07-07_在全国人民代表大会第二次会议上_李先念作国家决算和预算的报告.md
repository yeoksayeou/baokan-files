Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian delivered a report on behalf of the State Council at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on the afternoon of July 6th, entitled "Report on the National Financial Accounts for 1954 and the National Budget for 1955."

Li Xiannian first reported on the national financial accounts for 1954.

Li Xiannian said: The 1954 national budget was realized under the premise of the gradual rise of our national economy. The execution of the budget, in turn, helped the development of the national economy. In the 1954 national financial accounts, the total revenue was 30,745,830,000 yuan (new currency, same below), with the annual revenue completing 113.15 percent of the budget; the annual expenditure in the 1954 national financial accounts was 24,632,440,000 yuan, completing 98.74 percent of the budgeted amount. Among them, expenditures for economic construction accounted for 50.17 percent of the annual expenditure, ranking first among all expenditures; expenditures for social, cultural, and educational undertakings accounted for 14.05 percent of the annual expenditure; defense expenditures accounted for 23.6 percent of the annual expenditure; national administrative expenses accounted for 8.78 percent of the annual expenditure; and credit insurance and other expenditures accounted for 3.4 percent. The execution of the 1954 national budget was good, guaranteeing the necessary allocations for national construction.

Li Xiannian said: The good execution of the 1954 national budget should primarily be attributed to the workers and peasants nationwide, who worked hard to develop production, overcame disasters and other difficulties, and tapped various potential economic forces, thereby not only completing the production plan but also exceeding the plan in many projects. The working class improved labor productivity and reduced costs in various ways, enabling state-owned enterprises to greatly overfulfill their profit plans, which played a decisive role in ensuring national budget revenue. However, we still have serious shortcomings in increasing production, practicing economy, improving systems, and opposing waste, and we must never be satisfied with the status quo.

Li Xiannian then reported on the national budget for 1955.

Li Xiannian said: 1955 is the third year of our country's first Five-Year Plan, and completing this year's national economic plan is of great significance for completing the entire Five-Year Plan. According to the resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China in March 1955 on the draft of the first Five-Year Plan, the 1955 national budget must adhere to the policy of increasing production and practicing economy in order to accumulate funds, ensure the needs of national economic construction, especially the construction of heavy industry, and maintain a considerable fiscal reserve. The 1955 national budget stipulates that the total revenue is 31,192,520,000 yuan, and the total annual expenditure is 29,736,720,000 yuan, with the total annual revenue exceeding the total annual expenditure by 1,455,800,000 yuan, resulting in an annual surplus.

The sources of the 1955 national budget revenue, excluding foreign loans, show the following changes in the proportion contributed by various social and economic components compared to 1954: the portion from the state-owned economy (including taxes and enterprise profit remittances) increased from 65.24 percent to 69.47 percent; the portion from the cooperative economy increased from 3.65 percent to 4.77 percent; the portion from the joint state-private economy increased from 1.66 percent to 1.98 percent; the portion from farmers (including agricultural producers' cooperatives) decreased from 14.23 percent to 11.76 percent; the portion from private industry and commerce decreased from 13.34 percent to 10.7 percent; and the remaining portion from different social and economic components decreased from 1.88 percent to 1.32 percent. The reason for this change is that the socialist economy will have greater growth; some private enterprises will continue to transform into joint state-private enterprises; and the state will continue to implement a policy of stabilizing burdens on farmers.

Li Xiannian said: When the Soviet government withdrew Soviet troops from the jointly used Sino-Soviet naval base in Lushunkou before the end of May 1955, in addition to transferring equipment to our country free of charge, it also transferred many military supplies in the form of loans. The Soviet government's enormous assistance to our country demonstrates the growing and unbreakable great friendship between the Soviet Union and China. Here, on behalf of our government, I express my deep gratitude to the Soviet government.

Li Xiannian said: The primary task of the 1955 national budget is to guarantee the development of heavy industry and correspondingly develop light industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings, based on the plan for developing the national economy. The 1955 national budget stipulates that expenditures for economic construction are 14,188,760,000 yuan, an increase of 14.81 percent over 1954, accounting for 47.72 percent of the annual expenditure. Among the expenditures for economic construction, industrial expenditures are 6,388,000,000 yuan, accounting for 45.02 percent of the total economic construction funds, an increase of 11.32 percent over 1954. Of this, 89.20 percent will be used for allocations to heavy industries such as electricity, coal, crude oil, metallurgy, chemical industry, and machinery manufacturing; 10.80 percent will be used for expenditures on light industries such as textiles, paper making, sugar, and salt.

In terms of economic construction expenditures, expenditures for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology account for 9.25 percent; expenditures for transportation account for 15.12 percent; expenditures for commerce, grain, foreign trade, and other departments account for 20.05 percent; and expenditures for reserve materials, municipal construction, investment in joint state-private enterprises, and other economic construction expenditures account for a total of 10.56 percent.

The realization of the 1955 national economic plan will increase our country's total industrial and agricultural output value by 7 percent compared to the previous year. The proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value will rise to 33.7 percent. In the total industrial output value, the output value of the means of production will rise to 45.1 percent. The proportion of various types of industry in the total industrial output value will rise to 59.3 percent for state-owned, 4.3 percent for cooperative-run, and 15.4 percent for joint state-private, while private will decrease to 21 percent. At the same time, many private industrial and commercial enterprises will, through state capitalist forms such as processing, ordering, consignment sales, and distribution, embark on the path of state planning. Handicraft production cooperatives will develop to 22,800. Agricultural production cooperatives have already developed to about 670,000 in the spring of this year, and efforts will be made to consolidate and continue to actively develop them this year under the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit.

With the development of the economy and the improvement of labor productivity, people's lives will be further improved. In 1955, the average wage (including promotions) of employees in various sectors of the national economy will increase by 3.3 percent. After the completion of 11 million square meters of housing built by various central ministries and their affiliated enterprises for employees in 1955, the living conditions of the majority of employees will also be further improved.

The 1955 national budget stipulates that expenditures for social, cultural, and educational undertakings are 3,850,690,000 yuan, accounting for 12.95 percent of the annual expenditure, an increase of 11.28 percent over 1954; national administrative expenses account for 7.54 percent of the annual expenditure, a decrease of 1.24 percent compared to the proportion in 1954; credit insurance and other expenditures account for 4.18 percent of the annual expenditure; and the total reserve fund accounts for 3.42 percent of the annual expenditure.

The portion of the total 1955 national budget expenditure used for capital construction (including economic, cultural, educational, and administrative aspects) will be 9,591,640,000 yuan, accounting for 32.26 percent of the annual budget expenditure, an increase of 10.43 percent over 1954. A large number of key construction units stipulated in the Five-Year Plan will begin construction or continue construction this year.

Li Xiannian said: Our country adheres to a peaceful policy. The people of our country are all engaged in the peaceful labor of building a great motherland. In 1955, economic construction and social, cultural, and educational expenditures accounted for 60.67 percent of our country's budget, which fully reflects the wishes of our people for peaceful construction. However, the imperialists are still surrounding us, occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and threatening us with a new world war. In order to defend the independence of our motherland, defend the sacred sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, protect the construction of the country, and liberate our country's territory of Taiwan, it is necessary to continue to strengthen national defense forces and consolidate national defense. The budget stipulates that defense expenditures for this year are 7,193,150,000 yuan, accounting for 24.19 percent of the annual expenditure, which is absolutely necessary.

In his report, Li Xiannian particularly emphasized the important significance of increasing production and practicing economy, opposing waste, for completing the 1955 national budget.

Li Xiannian said: The current task of the Communist Party of China, the democratic parties and non-party individuals, the people's organizations, the government departments, and the people of the whole country is to implement the struggle to increase production and practice economy, to overcome waste as much as possible, to increase the country's revenue, to save the country's expenditure, to enrich the country's fiscal reserves, and to accelerate the accumulation of funds for socialist construction. This is an important and necessary guarantee for the smooth completion of the 1955 national budget.

Li Xiannian said: In order to increase production, practice economy, and oppose waste, the following steps must be taken according to the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: First, in the industrial, transportation, and commercial sectors, efforts must be made to increase production and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan. Second, in terms of capital construction, investments and various expenses should be reduced according to regulations, and efforts should be made to continue to reduce construction and installation costs. Lower the design standards for various civil buildings. Third, the competent departments and financial departments should strengthen the review of plans, designs, and budgets for capital construction, as well as the supervision of construction and fund allocation, and strive to eliminate waste in every link. Fourth, reduce the expenditure standards for operating expenses, procurement expenses, and office miscellaneous expenses in various agencies and institutions, and reduce the expenditure standards for such expenses in various enterprises. Fifth, streamline state organs. Sixth, the competent departments should actively improve and strengthen the work of formulating quotas and managing quotas, so as to gradually legalize and institutionalize various conservation measures. Seventh, preparations should be made to gradually improve various financial systems and strengthen financial supervision. Eighth, launch a mass movement to increase production, practice economy, and oppose waste and corruption.

Li Xiannian concluded by saying: The 1955 national budget is a reflection of the national interest and the will of the people. The government is determined to rely on the broad masses of the people across the country to resolutely realize the 1955 national budget, resolutely launch the struggle to increase production, practice economy, and oppose waste and corruption, ensure the continuous improvement of our country's economic and financial situation, ensure the completion of the 1955 national economic construction plan, and lay the foundation for the smooth completion of our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

　　在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
　　李先念作国家决算和预算的报告
    新华社六日讯　中华人民共和国国务院副总理、财政部长李先念六日下午在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上代表国务院作了“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”。
    李先念首先报告了一九五四年的国家决算。
    李先念说：一九五四年国家预算是在我国国民经济逐渐高涨的前提下实现的。预算执行的结果又帮助了国民经济的发展。一九五四年国家决算中收入总数为三百零七亿四千五百八十三万元（新币，下同），本年收入完成预算的百分之一一三点一五；一九五四年国家决算中本年支出二百四十六亿三千二百四十四万元，完成预算数的百分之九八点七四。其中，经济建设的支出占本年支出百分之五零点一七，居于各项支出的第一位；社会文教事业支出占本年支出百分之一四点零五；国防支出占本年支出百分之二三点六；国家行政经费支出占本年支出百分之八点七八；信贷保险和其他支出占本年支出百分之三点四。一九五四年国家预算执行情况是良好的，保证了国家建设所需要的拨款。
    李先念说：一九五四年国家预算执行得良好，基本上应当归功于全国的工人和农民，他们努力地发展了生产，战胜了灾荒和其他困难，挖掘了各种潜在的经济力量，从而不仅完成了生产计划，并且在很多项目中超额完成了计划。工人阶级用种种方法提高劳动生产率，降低了成本，使国营企业利润计划得以大大地超额完成，这对于保证国家预算收入起了决定性的作用。但是我们在增加生产、厉行节约、健全制度、反对浪费等方面还有很严重的缺点，我们绝对不能满足于现状。
    李先念接着报告了一九五五年的国家预算。
    李先念说：一九五五年是我国进入第一个五年建设计划的第三年，完成这一年国民经济计划，对完成整个五年计划有重大的意义。根据一九五五年三月中国共产党全国代表会议关于第一个五年计划草案的决议，一九五五年国家预算必须坚持贯彻增加生产、厉行节约的方针，以便积累资金，保证国民经济建设首先是重工业建设的需要，并保持相当的财政后备力量。一九五五年国家预算规定收入总数为三百一十一亿九千二百五十二万元，本年支出合计为二百九十七亿三千六百七十二万元，本年收入总数超过本年支出十四亿五千五百八十万元，成为本年结余。
    一九五五年国家预算收入的来源，除国外贷款外，如果从各种社会经济成分缴纳所占比重来看，同一九五四年比较有如下的变化：来自国营经济
  （包括纳税和企业收入上缴）的部分由百分之六五点二四增长到百分之六九点四七；来自合作社经济的部分由百分之三点六五增长到百分之四点七七；来自公私合营经济的部分由百分之一点六六增长到百分之一点九八；来自农民的部分（包括农业生产合作社）由百分之一四点二三下降为百分之一一点七六；来自私营工商业的部分由百分之一三点三四下降为百分之一零点七；来自不同社会经济成分的其余部分由百分之一点八八下降为百分之一点三二。这种变化的原因是：社会主义经济将有更大的增长；私营企业将继续有一部分转变为公私合营；国家对农民仍继续实行稳定负担的政策。
    李先念说：苏联政府在一九五五年五月底前自中苏共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退苏联军队时，除无偿地向我国移交了设备外，并以贷款形式转让了许多军用物资。苏联政府对我国这样巨大的援助表现了苏中两国牢不可破的伟大友谊的日益增长，我在这里代表我国政府向苏联政府表示深切的感谢。
    李先念说：一九五五年国家预算支出的首要任务是根据发展国民经济的计划，保证发展重工业，并相应地发展轻工业、农业、交通运输业和文化教育事业。一九五五年国家预算规定经济建设支出为一百四十一亿八千八百七十六万元，比一九五四年增长百分之一四点八一，占本年支出的百分之四七点七二。在经济建设支出中，工业支出为六十三亿八千八百万元，占经济建设费总数的百分之四五点零二，比一九五四年增长百分之一一点三二。其中百分之八十九点二零将用于电力、煤炭、原油、冶金、化学、机械制造等重工业的拨款；百分之一零点八零将用于纺织、造纸、糖、食盐等轻工业的支出。
    在经济建设支出方面，农业、林业、水利、气象的支出占百分之九点二五；交通运输支出占百分之一五点一二；商业、粮食、对外贸易等部门的支出占百分之二零点零五；储备物资支出、市政建设支出、公私合营企业投资支出和其他经济建设支出共占百分之一零点五六。
      一九五五年国民经济计划的实现，将使我国工农业总产值比上年增长百分之七。现代工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重将上升为百分之三三点七。而在工业总产值中，生产资料的产值将上升到百分之四五点一。各类工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，国营将上升到百分之五九点三，合作社营将上升到百分之四点三，公私合营将上升到百分之一五点四，私营下降为百分之二一。同时，将有不少的私营工商业要经过加工、定货、代销、经销等国家资本主义形式，走上国家计划轨道。手工业生产合作社将发展到二万二千八百个。农业生产合作社在本年春季已经发展到六十七万个左右，本年内将在坚持自愿互利的原则下努力巩固并继续积极发展。
    随着经济的发展和劳动生产率的提高，人民生活将有进一步的改善。一九五五年内，国民经济各部门企业职工的平均工资（包括提级）将提高百分之三点三。一九五五年中央各部及其所属企业为职工修建的一千一百万平方公尺住宅完成以后，广大职工的居住条件也将有进一步改善。
    一九五五年国家预算规定社会文教事业的支出为三十八亿五千零六十九万元，占本年支出的百分之一二点九五，比一九五四年增长百分之一一点二八；国家行政经费支出占本年支出的百分之七点五四，比一九五四年的比重下降百分之一点二四；信贷保险和其他支出占本年支出百分之四点一八；总预备费占本年支出的百分之三点四二。
    一九五五年全部国家预算支出中用于基本建设
  （包括经济、文教、行政各方面）的部分将有九十五亿九千一百六十四万元，占本年预算支出的百分之三二点二六，比一九五四年增长百分之一零点四三。五年计划所规定的大批重点建设单位，将在今年开始施工或继续施工。
    李先念说：我们的国家坚持和平政策。我国人民都在从事着建设伟大祖国的和平劳动。一九五五年我国预算中经济建设费和社会文化教育费占本年支出的百分之六零点六七，这就充分反映了我国人民和平建设的愿望。但是帝国主义者还在包围着我们，侵占我国的领土台湾，并用新的世界战争威胁着我们。为着保卫我们祖国的独立，保卫我国神圣主权和领土的完整，保卫国家的建设，并解放我国的领土台湾，必须继续增强国防力量，巩固国防。本年预算规定国防费支出七十一亿九千三百一十五万元，占本年支出的百分之二四点一九，这是完全必要的。
    李先念在他的报告中，特别着重地强调增产节约，反对浪费，对完成一九五五年的国家预算的重要意义。
    李先念说：中国共产党、各民主党派和无党派人士、各人民团体、政府各部门和全国人民的当前任务就是要贯彻增产节约的斗争，尽一切可能来克服浪费现象，来增加国家的收入，节省国家的支出，来充实国家的财政后备，加速社会主义建设资金的积累。这是顺利完成一九五五年国家预算的重要的和必要的保证。
    李先念说：为了增产节约，反对浪费，根据国务院和中共中央的指示，必须采取如下的步骤：第一，在工业、运输业、商业各部门中要努力增加生产，为全面地完成和超额完成国家计划而斗争。第二，在基本建设方面，要按照规定削减投资和各种费用，并争取继续降低建筑安装成本。降低各种民用建筑的设计标准。第三，各主管部门和财政部门要加强对于基本建设的计划、设计、预算的审核和施工、拨款的监督，力求消除每一环节的浪费。第四，在各机关和事业单位降低事业费、购置费和办公杂支费的开支标准，各企业的这类费用的开支标准也实行降低。第五，精简国家机关。第六，各主管部门应当积极改善和加强制定定额的工作和定额管理工作，以便使各种节约措施逐步地法律化，制度化。第七，应当有准备有步骤地健全各种财政制度，加强财政监督。第八，要开展增产节约、反对浪费和贪污的群众运动。
    李先念最后说：一九五五年的国家预算是国家利益和人民意志的反映。政府决心依靠全国人民群众，坚决实现一九五五年的国家预算，坚决展开增产节约、反对浪费和贪污的斗争，保证我国的经济状况和财政状况的不断改进，保证一九五五年国民经济建设计划的完成，并且为我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的顺利完成奠定基础。
