    Dangerous Decision
    Pakistan's Prime Minister Ali, abandoning his long-held cautious attitude towards the Turkish-Iraqi pact instigated by the United States, suddenly announced on July 1 that Pakistan had decided to join the Turkish-Iraqi pact. According to Ali, Pakistan made this decision based on the agreement it had signed with Turkey earlier and its membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    As everyone knows, the Turkish-Iraqi pact signed on February 24, 1955, is an important step taken by the United States to establish an aggressive military bloc in the Middle East and prepare for a new war. The United States is attempting to use this pact as a center to split the unity of Arab countries, gradually pull them into a Middle Eastern aggressive bloc, and make them serve the aggressive policies of the United States. According to the strategic plan of the United States, this Middle Eastern bloc should serve as a bridge connecting the military aggression systems established by the United States in Asia and Europe, thereby forming an encirclement around China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. Starting from such a plan, the United States is attempting to first organize Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, which are adjacent to China and the Soviet Union, into a so-called "Northern Tier defense chain," and then exert pressure on other Middle Eastern countries to force them to join.
    This activity of the United States in organizing military blocs in the Middle East first endangers the independence and security of the Middle Eastern countries, undermines the unity of the Arab countries, and intensifies the situation in the region, increasing the threat of war. It is precisely for this reason that the Turkish-Iraqi pact has been resolutely opposed by the Arab people and many Arab countries. Therefore, this aggressive treaty has been unable to develop. Peace-loving countries and people around the world fully support this position of the Arab people.
    Pakistan is not unconcerned about the unity and independence of the Arab countries. Pakistan, along with many Arab countries, participated in the Asian-African Conference, which symbolizes the unity of the Asian and African peoples. The declaration of the Asian-African Conference called for promoting world peace and strengthening international cooperation. Pakistan's Prime Minister Ali is a supporter of this declaration. How can one understand the decision announced by Prime Minister Ali, starting from such a premise? Pakistan's participation in this treaty increases the pressure from the United States to split the Arab countries, thereby increasing the unease and suspicion in the Middle East. This is neither in line with the position Pakistan took at the Asian-African Conference, nor is it in Pakistan's interest at all. This is something that anyone can see.
    The so-called "Northern Tier defense chain" that the United States is attempting to organize through the Turkish-Iraqi pact is a step in preparing for war, and its target is the Soviet Union and China. This is openly admitted by the American aggressive bloc.
    Pakistan is a neighbor of China, and it has repeatedly expressed its willingness to maintain good-neighborly and friendly relations with China. The Chinese people have always been willing to regard Pakistan as a friend.
    Now, by participating in the Turkish-Iraqi pact, Pakistan has joined the so-called "Northern Tier defense chain" of the United States, placing itself in a position where it is used by the United States as a base for military threats against China. It is difficult to understand how this can be reconciled with Pakistan's repeatedly expressed desire for friendship with China. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the claim that the Turkish-Iraqi pact is of a defensive nature is groundless. In the Middle East, as in other parts of the world, there is no military attack or threat of force from the Soviet Union and China. Fair world opinion recognizes that the Soviet Union and China seek peace, and even many American journalists believe that the Soviet Union and China do not want to fight. They even describe this as a weakness of the Soviet Union and China. It can be seen from this that the purpose of the United States in organizing military blocs and establishing bases in the Middle East, like its purpose in doing so in other parts of the world, is only to exacerbate tensions and prepare to provoke a new war.
    Now, in this war preparation plan of the United States, Pakistan has joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the south and the Turkish-Iraqi pact in the north. In this way, regardless of Pakistan's subjective wishes, it is in great danger of being dragged by the United States into a new war prepared by the United States, causing unprecedented and enormous disasters to the people of Pakistan.
    The Chinese people do not want to see the Pakistani people get involved in foreign war conspiracies. As friends of the Pakistani people, we hope that Pakistan will carefully consider this dangerous decision from the perspective of its own interests and the interests of world peace.

### 危险的决定

    危险的决定
    巴基斯坦总理阿里放弃了他长期以来对美国所策动签订的土耳其—伊拉克条约的审慎态度，突然在七月一日宣布：巴基斯坦决定参加土伊条约。据阿里说，巴基斯坦是根据它在早些时候和土耳其签订的协定和它的东南亚条约组织会员国的资格而采取这个决定的。
    大家知道，在一九五五年二月二十四日签订的土伊条约，是美国为了在中东地区建立侵略性的军事集团、准备新战争而采取的重要步骤。美国企图以这个条约为中心来分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，把它们逐步地拉进一个中东侵略集团，使它们为美国的侵略政策服务。按照美国的战略计划，这个中东集团应当充当联系美国在亚洲和欧洲建立的军事侵略体系的桥梁，从而构成对中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的包围圈。从这样的打算出发，美国企图首先将毗邻中国和苏联的巴基斯坦、伊朗、伊拉克、土耳其组织成所谓“北层防御锁链”，然后对其它中东国家施加压力，迫使它们参加。
    美国在中东地区的这种组织军事集团的活动首先就危害了中东国家的独立和安全，破坏了阿拉伯国家的团结，并且使这个地区的局势紧张，战争威胁加重。正是因为这个原故，所以土伊条约受到了阿拉伯人民和许多阿拉伯国家的坚决反对，因此这个侵略条约一直不能有所发展。世界爱好和平的国家和人民对阿拉伯人民的这种立场是完全支持的。
    巴基斯坦对阿拉伯国家之间的团结和它们的独立不是不关心的。巴基斯坦和许多阿拉伯国家一起参加了象征着亚非人民的团结的亚非会议。亚非会议的宣言号召促进世界和平，加强国际合作。巴基斯坦的阿里总理是这个宣言的拥护者。从这样的前提出发，人们怎么能理解阿里总理所宣布的这个决定呢？巴基斯坦参加这个条约就使美国分裂阿拉伯国家的压力得以增加，从而使中东地区的不安和疑惧更为增长。这既不符合于巴基斯坦在亚非会议上所采取的立场，同时也对巴基斯坦完全不利。这是任何人都能看到的。
    美国通过土伊条约企图组织的所谓“北层防御锁链”，是一个准备战争的步骤、其目标是苏联和中国。这是美国侵略集团所直言不讳的。
    巴基斯坦是中国的邻国，它曾经不止一次表示过愿意和中国保持睦邻友好的关系。中国人民一向也是愿意把巴基斯坦当作朋友看待的。
    现在，巴基斯坦通过参加土伊条约而参加了美国的所谓“北层防御锁链”，使自己处在一种被美国当作对中国进行军事威胁的基地的地位。人们很难理解这如何可以同巴基斯坦所一再表示的对中国友好的愿望相协调。而且应当指出：所谓土伊条约是防御性质的说法是毫无根据的。在中东，就像在世界其他地区一样，并不存在苏联和中国的武力攻击或武力威胁。世界公正舆论都承认苏联和中国要谋求和平，甚至美国许多记者都认为中苏两国不要打仗。他们甚至把这说成是中苏两国的弱点。由此可见，美国在中东组织军事集团，建立基地的目的，同它在世界其他地区这样做的目的一样，只是为了加剧紧张局势，准备挑起新战争。
    现在，在美国的这个准备战争的计划中，巴基斯坦在南面参加了东南亚集团，在北面又参加了土伊条约。这样，不管巴基斯坦的主观愿望如何，它有身不由主地被美国拖进一场美国所准备的新战争的极大危险，使巴基斯坦人民受到空前巨大的灾难。
    中国人民不愿意看到巴基斯坦人民卷到外来的战争阴谋中去。作为巴基斯坦人民的朋友，我们希望巴基斯坦从本身的利益和世界和平的利益着想，慎重考虑一下这个危险的决定。
