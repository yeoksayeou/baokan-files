Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, held a grand reception on the evening of the 10th to host all members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Troupe, headed by Major General Damdin Hoshuu.

The Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China, Ochirbat, and embassy officials were also invited to attend the reception.

Among those present at the reception tonight were Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi and Ulanhu, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Director of the Second Office Lin Feng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Acting Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, Vice Ministers Ding Xilin and Xia Yan, Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Zongxun and Chen Geng, Deputy Directors of the General Political Department Xiao Hua and Gan Siqi, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and figures from the capital's literary and art circles.

As all members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Troupe, led by Major General Damdin Hoshuu, entered the venue, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with each of them at the door. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly to express their welcome.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the reception: I now represent the government and people of the People's Republic of China in warmly welcoming the visit and performance of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, and in celebrating the success of your performance tonight.

The Mongolian people are a brave and progressive nation. This performance by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army reflects the fighting spirit and creativity of the Mongolian people. This is worth learning from for our Chinese People's Liberation Army's literary and art workers.

The people of Mongolia and China have a long-standing friendly relationship. I believe that through this performance by the Song and Dance Troupe, and the performances to be held in various parts of China, the friendship between the armies and peoples of China and Mongolia will be consolidated and developed.

I propose a toast:
To the friendship between the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
To the friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia!
To the health of all comrades of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Troupe!
To the health of Comrade Tsedenbal, Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic, leader of the Mongolian people, and a close friend of the Chinese people!
Cheers!

Major General Damdin Hoshuu delivered a reply. He said: Please allow me, on behalf of the working people of Mongolia, all commanders and soldiers of the People's Revolutionary Army, and all comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe, to express our heartfelt thanks to Comrade Premier and, through you, to the great Chinese people.

Economic and cultural cooperation between Mongolia and China is developing day by day. Chinese cultural and artistic representatives have visited our country many times with their excellent artistic achievements. At a time when our country is undertaking large-scale construction, many Chinese technicians have supported us with practical actions. These have further encouraged the will and labor enthusiasm of our people to build their own country.

The new railway connecting the capitals of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, a railway of friendship, has now been completed, which is a symbol of the eternal friendship between the peoples of our three countries.

During this visit to China for performances, our Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Troupe, in addition to introducing our artistic achievements to our close friends, the Chinese people, will also learn from the great Chinese people who are victoriously carrying out socialist construction to create their own free and happy lives. The kind care and meticulous attention of the Chinese people and their government have greatly encouraged us to successfully complete our task.

We are deeply convinced that the successful completion of this performance task will help the ever-developing brotherly friendship between our two peoples and will help to further consolidate and develop the common cause of our two peoples.

I propose: To congratulate the great achievements of our great neighbor, the Chinese people and their Chinese People's Liberation Army, in the struggle to build their country's socialist cause, and to the good health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people and a loyal friend of the Mongolian people, please drink a toast!

Premier Zhou Enlai's and Major General Damdin Hoshuu's speeches were frequently interrupted by warm applause from the audience.

At the reception, the Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China, Ochirbat, also spoke.

During the reception, artists from China and Mongolia performed wonderful programs, and bursts of applause rang out in the hall to express their gratitude.

Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, and Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai, met with Major General Damdin Hoshuu, the leader and head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Troupe, Deputy Head Colonel Chindi, Lieutenant Colonel Namjildorj, Artistic Director Major Tserendorj, and Troupe Leader Secretary Jamsenbalasan at 7:15 pm on the 10th.
