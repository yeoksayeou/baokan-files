The Huainan Mining Bureau recently cancelled the planned Xiejiaji No. 4 mine and instead decided to drive a stone gate from the Xiejiaji No. 2 mine to extract coal, which can save the state more than 300,000 yuan in investment. The originally planned No. 4 mine in Xiejiaji required a large investment in surface and underground construction, while the coal reserves were not large. Now, changing to extracting coal by driving a stone gate from the existing Xiejiaji No. 2 mine will not only not affect coal production, but also save many unnecessary buildings. The original plan was to invest more than 400,000 yuan this year, but now only 100,000 yuan is needed.

　  淮南矿务局改变打井计划
    淮南矿务局最近把计划中的谢家集四号矿井取消，改由谢家集二号矿井打石门取煤，可以为国家节约投资三十多万元。该局原计划在谢家集打的四号矿井，井上井下建筑需要大量投资，而煤藏量并不多。现在改为从已经有的谢家集二号矿井打一石门过去采煤，既不影响煤的生产，又可以省去许多不必要的建筑。原计划今年投资四十多万元，现在只要十万元就够了。
