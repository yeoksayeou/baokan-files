　　尼赫鲁在维也纳谈印度支那问题
　　他并召集印度驻欧洲国家使节举行会议
    新华社三十日讯　据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在维也纳举行的记者招待会上，曾经谈到印度支那问题。他说：印度在印度支那作为国际委员会的主席，负有执行日内瓦协定的责任。
    尼赫鲁说：某些困难已经出现，如果北越和南越之间关于选举问题的预备性会谈到规定的七月二十日还不能安排好，日内瓦协定就将处于危险中。
    尼赫鲁又说：在柬埔寨和美国之间的军事援助协定问题上，也发生了困难。问题是这个协定是否符合日内瓦协定。
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社维也纳二十九日讯：据报纸报道，现在在萨尔斯堡的印度总理尼赫鲁召集印度驻苏联、波兰、法国、德意志联邦共和国、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克、荷兰、南斯拉夫、意大利、埃及、奥地利、瑞士等国的大使和公使举行会议。
