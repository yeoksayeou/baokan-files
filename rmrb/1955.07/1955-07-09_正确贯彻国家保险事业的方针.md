Correctly Implement the National Insurance Program's Policy
Bei Zhongxuan, General Manager of the People's Insurance Company of China

Our country's national insurance program serves the country's economic construction and the improvement of the people's material well-being. For more than five years, the People's Insurance Company of China has implemented compulsory insurance for the property of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives above the county level, and passengers traveling by train, ship, and airplane; and has developed various voluntary property and personal insurance businesses in cities.

For more than five years, the national insurance program has begun to accumulate centralized insurance funds, increasing the reserve strength of the national economy. The accumulation and use of this insurance fund enables production enterprises and individuals who have suffered disasters to receive due compensation in accordance with the provisions of the insurance contract, thereby helping them to quickly restore production. At the same time, the funds accumulated by the national insurance program that are temporarily not in use can also be invested in production through bank credit; part of the national insurance company's year-end surplus can also be turned over to the financial departments as state budget revenue to support national construction. For more than five years, the national insurance program has used 150 million yuan to compensate for losses to the national economy due to disasters, including compensation for the loss of 950,000 head of livestock and more than 200,000 mu of crops in rural areas alone. In addition, 10 million yuan was subsidized for local fire protection construction and rural animal disease prevention, which played a certain role in developing production and reducing disaster losses.

However, in the development of the national insurance program, due to subjectivism in the leadership's thinking and bureaucratic work styles of the National Insurance Company, insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, and a lack of experience, deviations of blind and rash advances also occurred in business development; especially in rural insurance, some areas experienced serious coercive commandism, arousing dissatisfaction among the peasants. In order to correct this deviation, after 1953, in conjunction with the rural anti-"Five Excesses" campaign, insurance business departments in most parts of the country temporarily suspended rural insurance, while rectifying urban insurance business and preliminarily rectifying the national insurance organization, so that insurance work was initially improved and enhanced.

In order to realize the general task of the state during the transition period, the state, based on the practice of national insurance work over the past five years and the advanced experience of Soviet state insurance, has determined that the basic policy of national insurance work in the next few years is: according to the needs of the planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, organize various insurance businesses for local state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, agriculture, handicrafts, state-capitalist industry and commerce, capitalist industry and commerce, and ordinary citizens, in order to absorb scattered social funds and establish centralized insurance funds, making them a part of the state's financial reserves. This insurance fund is mainly used to compensate economic units and individuals participating in insurance for losses caused by natural disasters and accidents, ensure the continuous development of production and the material welfare of workers, and subsidize local disaster prevention expenses, cooperate with relevant departments to carry out disaster prevention measures, strengthen the fight against disasters, and reduce the loss of social wealth. This policy correctly explains the nature, tasks, and role of the national insurance program. First of all, it shows that national insurance is an inseparable part of the national reserve, a specialized reserve used to cope with natural disasters and accidents, and its main function is to ensure the planned development of the national economy and the smooth realization of expanded reproduction. At the same time, this policy also shows that national insurance is an important link in the national financial system, and through the establishment of insurance funds and compensation to the insured, it systematically redistributes national income, which plays a certain role in stabilizing the state budget. Therefore, national insurance is one of the important tools to ensure the normal development of the national economy, an economic task that is beneficial to production, beneficial to socialist construction, and beneficial to socialist transformation. A correct understanding of this policy can clarify some incorrect understandings of the tasks and roles of the national insurance program, such as some people mistakenly believing that insurance work has no role to play, is dispensable, and has no prospects for development; some people one-sidedly emphasize that the national insurance program can accumulate construction funds for the country, neglecting the role that the national insurance program should really play, and failing to understand that the main purpose of accumulating funds by the national insurance program is to compensate for disaster losses. Due to this wrong understanding, national insurance business departments have failed to correctly lead the advancement of insurance work, even failing to see the development prospects of the insurance program and not attaching importance to insurance work, and individual insurance workers are uneasy in their work and not actively improving insurance work.

In order to correctly implement the national insurance program's policy, first of all, rural insurance should be restored and developed in a planned way to cooperate with the socialist transformation of agriculture. Because the agricultural economy is more likely to suffer from natural disasters, and the economic strength of agriculture to resist disaster losses is relatively weak. Therefore, carrying out insurance business in rural areas to cooperate with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and develop agricultural production is of great significance.

The restoration of rural insurance business must be based on the actual situation in rural areas, and must proceed steadily with conditions, plans, and steps. Because the economic development of our country's rural areas is currently unbalanced, the peasants' demands for insurance are also inconsistent, and rural insurance work lacks a set of mature experiences, so we should first select some areas with better economic conditions, a more solid foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, mass demand for insurance, and certain animal disease prevention conditions, to restore and handle livestock insurance in a focused and controlled manner, and should focus on agricultural production cooperatives. We must prevent the rash advance that may arise in the new situation of the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At the same time, we should also pay attention to overcoming the peasants' thinking of not actively improving the feeding and management of livestock and passively relying on insurance after taking out insurance. When the livestock insurance of cooperatives is well managed and other conditions are met, livestock insurance for mutual aid teams and individual peasants can also be handled. However, the principle of voluntarism must be strictly implemented to resolutely prevent the coercive commandism caused by blindly expanding business. In the operation of insurance business, it is required to conduct in-depth publicity to the peasants, continuously improve insurance work, and correctly implement the principle of economic accounting to ensure the steady development of insurance business.

Secondly, the insurance of state-owned enterprises should be gradually discontinued in a planned way. With the gradual strengthening of the state's financial reserve strength and the increasing soundness of the economic accounting system of state-owned enterprises in the future, the insurance of state-owned enterprises can be gradually discontinued in a planned way as the state's financial budget management and enterprise financial system are arranged. Which departments are prepared, and arrangements have been made in the financial and financial system, the compulsory property insurance of those departments can be discontinued. Before the discontinuation, the insurance company and the insured unit should still conscientiously do a good job in renewal work, and it is necessary to pay attention to preventing the occurrence of disconnection. As for the cargo transportation insurance of state-owned enterprises, which is currently implemented as voluntary insurance, it can be handled according to the actual needs of various departments. Local state-owned enterprises should continue to handle insurance due to the limited financial reserve strength of the local government. In the future, the national insurance program should gradually shift its main strength to organizing the scattered social funds.

Thirdly, urban voluntary insurance business should be developed steadily. The main targets of urban voluntary insurance business are state-capitalist and capitalist industry and commerce. According to the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the development of insurance for urban joint state-private and private industry and commerce can, on the one hand, ensure the normal progress of their production and operation that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and on the other hand, can compensate for the loss of state-commissioned processing, ordering, purchasing, and sales of materials. This is not only conducive to supervising safe production to protect production enterprises, but also conducive to protecting workers and employees in private industry and commerce from unexpected losses when enterprises suffer disasters. However, in order to prevent the malpractice of illegal capitalists taking out high insurance and setting fires to defraud compensation, special attention should be paid to insurance methods, especially in property valuation and determination of the amount of insurance, and supervision should be strengthened in disaster prevention.

In addition, with the development of production and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, the state should systematically organize various property insurance and personal insurance that meet the needs of the masses, and become a supplementary guarantee in addition to social welfare.

Insurance work is an indispensable aspect of our country's economic system, and it is also one of the tools for the state to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation. Our country is so large, the tasks of construction and transformation are so arduous and heavy, and the experience of all aspects of work is still very insufficient, so organizing the reserve strength of the national economy and compensating for disaster losses is a task that cannot be ignored. It is hoped that party committees, governments at all levels, and relevant departments will strengthen their leadership and assistance to the national insurance work, and improve the policy and ideological level of the national insurance work cadres, so that the national insurance program can develop steadily and healthily.

　　正确贯彻国家保险事业的方针
　　中国人民保险公司总经理　贝仲选
    我国的国家保险事业是为国家的经济建设事业和为提高人民的物质福利而服务的。五年多来，中国人民保险公司已先后对国营企业、县以上合作社的财产和乘火车、轮船、飞机的旅客，实行了强制保险；并在城市里开展了各种自愿的财产保险和人身保险业务。
    五年多来，国家保险事业已开始积累了集中的保险基金，增加了国民经济的后备力量。这种保险基金的聚积和运用，使遭受灾害的生产事业和个人，可根据保险契约的规定得到应有的补偿，从而帮助他们迅速恢复生产。同时，国家保险事业所积累起来而暂时不用的资金，还可以通过银行信贷投入生产；国家保险公司年终盈余的一部分资金，还可以一部分缴给财政部门作为国家预算的收入，支援国家建设。五年多来，国家保险事业用于补偿国民经济因灾害而损失的赔款，即达一亿五千万元，其中仅农村保险就赔偿了牲畜九十五万头和二十多万亩农作物的损失。另外还补助地方消防建设和农村畜疫防治的费用一千万元，这对于发展生产减少灾害损失是起了一定的作用的。
    但是，在国家保险事业的发展过程中，由于国家保险公司的领导思想上有主观主义和工作上的官僚主义作风，对小农经济的特点没有足够的认识，加以经验不足，在业务发展上也曾发生过盲目冒进的偏差；特别在农村保险方面，有些地区发生了严重的强迫命令作风，引起了农民的不满。为了纠正这一偏差，一九五三年以后，曾结合农村反“五多”，在全国大部分地区保险业务部门暂时停办了农村保险，同时整顿了城市保险业务和初步整顿了国家保险机构，使保险工作得到了初步的改进和提高。
    为了实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，国家根据五年多来国家保险工作的实践和苏联国家保险的先进经验，确定了今后数年内国家保险工作的基本方针是：根据国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的需要，对地方国营企业、合作社企业、农业、手工业、国家资本主义工商业、资本主义工商业和一般公民组织各种保险业务，以便吸取分散的社会资金，建立集中的保险基金，使之成为国家财政后备的一部分。这种保险基金主要是用来补偿参加保险的经济单位和个人因自然灾害和意外事故所造成的损失，保证生产的不断发展和劳动者的物质福利，并补助地方防灾费用，配合有关部门进行防灾措施，加强抵抗灾害的斗争，减少社会财富的损失。这个方针正确地说明了国家保险事业的性质、任务和它的作用。首先，它表明了国家保险是国家后备不可分割的一部分，是用来应付自然灾害和意外事故的一种专门的后备，它的主要职能是保证国民经济有计划的发展和扩大再生产的顺利实现。同时，这一方针还表明了，国家保险是国家财政体系的重要环节之一，通过保险基金的建立和对于投保人的赔偿，有计划地进行国民收入的再分配，对于稳定国家预算是有一定作用的。因此，国家保险是保证国民经济正常发展的重要工具之一，是有利于生产、有利于社会主义建设、有利于社会主义改造的一项经济工作。对于这一方针作正确的理解，可以澄清有些人对国家保险的任务和作用方面存在的一些不正确的认识，如有些人错误地认为保险工作没有什么作用，可有可无，没有什么发展的前途；有些人片面地强调国家保险事业可以为国家积累建设资金，忽视了国家保险事业真正应该发挥的作用，没有理解到国家保险事业积累资金的主要目的是用来补偿灾害损失的。由于这种错误的认识，曾使国家保险业务部门发生了不能正确领导保险工作前进，甚至看不到保险事业的发展前途而不重视保险工作，以及个别保险工作人员为此而不安心工作，不积极改进保险工作等现象。
    为了正确贯彻国家保险事业的方针，首先，应当有计划地恢复和发展农村保险，以配合农业的社会主义改造。因为农业经济遭受自然灾害的可能性较大，农业抵抗灾害损失的经济力量亦比较薄弱。因此，在农村进行保险业务以配合互助合作运动、发展农业生产就具有重要的意义。
    恢复农村保险业务，必须根据农村实际情况，有条件、有计划、有步骤地稳步前进。因为目前我国农村经济发展不平衡，农民对保险的要求也不一致，加以农村保险工作还缺乏一套成熟的经验，所以应该首先选择某些经济条件较好，互助合作运动较有基础，群众要求保险，又有一定畜疫防治条件的地区，有重点、有控制地恢复办理牲畜保险，并应以农业生产合作社为主要对象。必须防止在互助合作运动大发展的新情况下可能产生的冒进情绪。同时，也要注意克服农民在保险以后，不积极改进牲畜的饲养管理，消极依赖保险的思想。在办好合作社牲畜保险而其他条件又已具备时，也可以兼办互助组和个体农民的牲畜保险。但必须严格贯彻自愿的原则，坚决防止由于盲目扩大业务而产生的强迫命令作风。在保险业务的经营上，要求向农民进行深入的宣传，不断改进保险工作，正确贯彻经济核算的原则，以保证保险业务的稳步发展。
    其次是有计划地逐步地停办国营企业的保险。随着今后国家财政后备力量的逐渐增强和国营企业经济核算制的日益健全，可以随着国家财政预算管理和企业财务制度的安排情况，有计划地逐步地停办国营企业的保险。哪些部门做好了准备，在财政和财务制度上有了安排，就可以停办哪些部门的财产强制保险，在没有停办之前，保险公司和被保险单位仍应认真做好续保工作，必须注意防止发生脱节现象。至于国营企业的物资运输保险，目前实行的是自愿保险，则可根据各部门的实际需要来办理。地方国营企业，由于地方财政后备力量有限，仍应继续办理保险。今后，国家保险事业应该把主要的力量逐渐地转向组织分散的社会资金的方面去。
    再次，应该稳步发展城市自愿保险业务。城市自愿保险业务的主要对象是国家资本主义和资本主义的工商业。根据国家对于资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策，发展城市公私合营和私营工商业的保险，一方面保障它们有利于国计民生的生产和经营的正常进行，同时还可以使国家委托加工、订货、代购、代销的物资受到损失时得到补偿。这样既有利于监督安全生产，以保护生产事业；同时有利于保障私营工商业中工人、店员在企业发生灾害时，免除意外的损失。但为了防止不法资本家的高额投保、纵火图赔等流弊，在保险办法上，特别是在财产估价、确定保额上，应该特别注意，并在防灾上加以监督。
    此外，随着生产的发展，人民物质和文化生活水平的不断提高，国家应该有计划地组织适合群众需要的各种财产保险和人身保险，成为社会福利以外的补充保证。
    保险工作是我国经济制度中不可缺少的一个方面，也是国家进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工具之一。我们的国家是如此之大，建设和改造的任务是如此的紧张繁重，各方面工作的经验还非常不够，因而组织国民经济的后备力量和补偿灾害损失，是一件不容忽视的工作。希望各级党委、政府和有关部门，加强对国家保险工作的领导和帮助，提高国家保险工作干部的政策思想水平，使国家保险事业能够稳步地健康地发展。
