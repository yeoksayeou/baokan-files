　　The United States Cannot Distort the Truth About the Situation in Indochina
　　Hu Jin
    Recently, the joint statements of both the Soviet-Indian and Polish-Indian emphasized the threats to the Geneva Accords, and advocated that elections should be implemented in relevant areas of Indochina in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.
    These peaceful appeals have triggered a crude and clumsy propaganda offensive in the United States. American propagandists are doing their best to distort and obscure the truth, attempting to conceal the real cause of the current serious situation in Indochina—American intervention and sabotage.
    These propagandists believe that facts are not worth considering, and they insist with their eyes closed that the difficulty in holding free elections in Vietnam is due to the so-called "Communist activities in Indochina." They dare not mention the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 6th, which announced that it was ready to hold consultative meetings with the responsible authorities of South Vietnam, starting from July 20th this year, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, to discuss the organization of free general elections in Vietnam next July. The statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not yet received a response from the South Vietnamese authorities.
    However, the actual intentions of the United States cannot be concealed. Recently, the Saigon correspondent of the French newspaper "Le Monde" repeatedly exposed the fact that the United States was obstructing the general election in Vietnam, saying: "The United States does not want a general election because it does not want the unification of South and North Vietnam, despite the fact that the armistice agreement repeatedly affirmed the principle of Vietnamese unification." The "New York Times" could not help but admit in its distorted propaganda that "a 'general' election would mean the defeat of the South by the North."
    Dulles hypocritically said on June 28th that they were "not afraid of holding elections at all," but then said that the United States would only agree to elections if it believed that there were "conditions for truly free elections." As everyone knows, Dulles' speech on March 8th had already exposed that the United States wanted to create excuses to obstruct free elections in Vietnam.
    It is necessary to refute the argument that is circulating, saying that the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities did not sign the Geneva Accords and therefore are not bound by the Geneva Accords. At that time, the United States and its protégé, the South Vietnamese authorities, refused to sign, precisely because they wanted to find excuses for their violations and sabotage of the Geneva Accords. But this will not work. The United States government has stated that it "will not use threats or force to hinder these agreements and provisions." The South Vietnamese authorities were bound by the military provisions of the Geneva Accords when implementing them, and must be bound in the future. The British Information Office also pointed out in its commentary on the Vietnamese general election: The Ngo Dinh Diem government "must work within the framework of the Geneva Accords." The continued abandonment of the solemn Geneva Accords and its statements by the United States, and the abandonment of national interests by South Vietnam in favor of serving the interests of the United States, should be condemned and opposed.
    The American propaganda machine is making a particularly loud noise about the situation in Laos. The notorious extreme reactionary and bellicose American senators Nolan and Mansfield and others have wantonly slandered the Lao Fighting Units which faithfully implement the Geneva Accords. Nolan even threatened to illegally raise the Lao issue in the United Nations. This clamor is clearly aimed at covering up the conspiracy of the United States to engage in a military agreement with Laos and intensify the instigation of military conflicts in Laos.
      Any distortion of the Lao Fighting Units' loyalty to the Geneva Accords and national interests is a waste of effort. As everyone knows, before the cessation of hostilities, the Lao Resistance Forces had liberated half of the territory of Laos and nearly half of the country's population. However, for the sake of peace, independence, and unity, they complied with the Geneva Accords and transferred and concentrated their troops throughout the country to the designated assembly areas of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, which had long been liberated by the Lao Fighting Units. At the same time, under the active promotion of the Lao Fighting Units, political meetings between the Lao Fighting Units and the Lao Royal Government began in January this year to discuss the political settlement of Laos. This meeting had achieved initial results and issued a joint statement, stating that both sides "will seek all possible ways to resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, with a view to achieving satisfactory results." However, due to the fault of the Lao Royal Government, the political meetings between the two sides have been repeatedly interrupted and have not made any progress. The assembly area of ​​the Lao Fighting Units has also been subjected to constant attacks. Recently, the Lao Royal Government not only did not stop these attacks, nor did it agree to resume political meetings, but also attempted to hold unilateral elections, excluding the participation of the Lao Fighting Units. All of these are violations of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    Now, the Lao people and those who care about the peace and unity of Laos hope that the current situation can be quickly improved. But the American aggressive bloc is not like this. It wants to fish in troubled waters and intensify its interference. The "New York Times" openly stated that the United States expressed "welcome" to the recent adventurous remarks of the Lao Royal Government that it would "take military measures." According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the United States will begin a special new aid program to support the Lao armed forces. Many reports reveal that the United States is planning to sign a military "aid" agreement with Laos. All of these prove that the United States is eager to expand the armed conflict in Laos, obstruct the unification of Laos, and wants to turn Laos into its military base.
    The United States is also carrying out plans to undermine the peace and independence of Cambodia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Vienna that "the military aid agreement between Cambodia and the United States has also caused difficulties." We have already pointed out that this agreement is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. It not only damages Cambodia's sovereignty and independence but will also make Cambodia a tool in the US aggressive policy in the Far East.
    In order to facilitate further US intervention and sabotage activities, US propagandists are also slandering and attacking the work of the International Commission in Indochina. The "New York Times," while clearly stating that the United States does not want to hold general elections in Vietnam, falsely accused the International Commission of saying: "The Geneva Accords stipulate 'neutral nation supervision' of elections, but so far, no 'supervisory' agency, whether in Korea or Vietnam, has ever proven to be able to fulfill its responsibilities." United Press also attacked the International Commission in Laos for not "satisfying" the Lao Royal Government. These propagandists are attacking the International Commission because the International Commission has contributed to the implementation of the Geneva Accords.
    It is impossible for the United States to conceal the truth about its endangering the peace of Indochina. All those who care about the peace of Indochina resolutely oppose these activities of the United States. Countries obligated to the Geneva Accords should guarantee and promote the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in practical actions. In particular, the French Federal Forces, as one party to the armistice agreement, should be responsible for promoting the political settlement of relevant countries in Indochina.

　　美国歪曲不了印度支那局势的真相
　　胡今
    最近，苏印和波印联合声明都强调了日内瓦协议所受到的威胁，都主张按照协议的规定在印度支那有关地方实施选举。
    这些和平呼吁在美国引起了粗率而拙劣的宣传攻势。美国宣传家们竭力歪曲和蒙混事实的真相，企图掩盖造成目前印度支那严重局势的真正原因——美国的干涉和破坏活动。
    这些宣传家们居然认为事实是不值一顾的，他们闭着眼睛硬说，造成越南举行自由选举的困难的是所谓“共产党在印度支那的活动”。他们根本不敢提到越南民主共和国政府在六月六日发表的声明，这个声明宣布它准备从日内瓦协议规定的今年七月二十日起，同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论明年七月在越南举行自由普选的组织问题。越南民主共和国政府的这个声明，至今没有得到南越当局的答复。
    但是，美国的实际意图是掩盖不住的。最近，法国“世界报”驻西贡记者就一再揭露了美国阻挠越南普选的事实说：“美国不希望普选，是因为它不愿意南越和北越统一，尽管停战协定屡次申明越南统一这一原则”。“纽约时报”在它的歪曲宣传中也不能不承认，“一次‘普’选将意味着北部击败南部”。
    杜勒斯在六月二十八日虚伪地说他们“根本不怕进行选举”，但又说，必须美国认为有“真正自由的选举的条件”，美国才赞同选举。大家知道，杜勒斯在三月八日的演说，就已经暴露了美国是想制造借口来阻挠越南的自由选举。
    必须驳斥正在流传的论调，说什么美国和南越当局没有在日内瓦协议上签字，它们就可以不受日内瓦协议的约束。当时美国及其卵翼下的南越当局不肯签字，就是想替自己违反和破坏日内瓦协议的行为找寻借口。但，这是行不通的。美国政府已声明它“将不使用威胁或武力去妨害这些协定和条款”。南越当局在执行日内瓦协定的军事条款时是受约束的，今后也必须受约束。英国新闻处在评论越南普选时也指出：吴庭艳政府“必须在日内瓦协定范围内进行工作”。美国继续背弃庄严的日内瓦协议和它的声明的行为，南越背弃民族利益、甘为美国利益服务的行为，应该受到谴责和反对。
    美国宣传机器对老挝局势叫得特别厉害。臭名远扬的极端反动和好战的美国参议员诺兰和曼斯菲尔德之流，大肆诽谤忠实执行日内瓦协定的寮国战斗部队。诺兰还威胁说要向联合国非法提出老挝问题。这种叫嚣清楚地是为了掩盖美国企图同老挝搞军事协定，并加紧煽动老挝的军事冲突的阴谋。
      要对寮国战斗部队忠于日内瓦协议和民族利益的情况加以任何歪曲，都是枉费心机的。大家知道，寮国抗战部队在敌对行动停止以前，曾解放了老挝的一半领土，解放了全国人口的将近一半，但为了和平、独立和统一的利益，他们遵照日内瓦协定把他们在全国的部队转移和集结到协定指定的集结区桑怒和丰沙里两省，这个地区也早已被寮国战斗部队所解放。同时，在寮国战斗部队的主动的推动下，寮国战斗部队和老挝王国政府双方在今年一月开始举行政治会议，讨论老挝的政治解决问题。这一次会议曾取得了初步的结果，发表了联合声明，表示双方“将寻求一切可能的办法，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，以期取得圆满的结果”。但是，由于老挝王国政府的过错，双方政治会议一再中断，没有取得任何进展。寮国战斗部队的集结区还受到了不断的进攻。最近，老挝王国政府不但没有停止这种进攻，不但不肯恢复政治会议，而且企图举行片面的选举，排斥寮国战斗部队参加。这都是违反日内瓦协定的规定的。
    现在，老挝人民和关心老挝的和平和统一的人，都希望目前这个局面能够迅速改善。但美国侵略集团却不是这样。它要混水摸鱼，要加紧干涉。“纽约时报”公开说，美国对老挝王国政府最近声言要“采取军事措施”的冒险言论，表示“欢迎”。据路透社华盛顿电，美国将着手进行一个特别的新的援助计划来支持老挝武装部队。不少消息透露，美国在策划同老挝签订军事“援助”协定。这些都证明美国正在急于扩大老挝的武装冲突，阻挠老挝的统一，想把老挝变成它的军事基地。
    美国在柬埔寨也正在进行着破坏柬埔寨和平和独立的计划。印度总理尼赫鲁在维也纳表示，“柬埔寨和美国之间的军事援助协定也引起了困难”。我们已经指出：这个协定是对日内瓦协定的严重违反。它不仅使柬埔寨的主权和独立受到损害，而且将使柬埔寨成为美国在远东的侵略政策中的一个工具。
    美国的宣传家们为了便利美国进一步进行干涉和破坏活动，又在中伤和攻击印度支那的国际委员会的工作。“纽约时报”明明是说美国不希望越南举行普选，却污蔑国际委员会说：“日内瓦协定规定‘中立国监察’选举，而至今为止，没有任何‘监察’机构，不论在朝鲜或越南，曾经证明是能够尽其职责的”。合众社也攻击在老挝的国际委员会没有“满足”老挝王国政府。这些宣传家攻击国际委员会，是因为国际委员会对实施日内瓦协定方面作出了贡献。
    美国要想掩盖它危害印度支那和平的真相是不可能的。所有关心印度支那和平的人都坚决反对美国的这些活动。负有日内瓦协议的义务的国家应该在实际行动上保证和促成日内瓦协议的全部实施。特别是作为停战协定一方的法兰西联邦部队更应负责促成印度支那有关国家的政治解决。
