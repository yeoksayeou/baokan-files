Fengyang County Produces Large Quantities of Quartz

　　Fengyang County, Anhui Province, now produces 600 tons of quartz monthly, supplying the glass and machinery manufacturing industries in Nanjing, Suzhou, Bengbu, and other places. A joint state-private glass factory newly moved from Shanghai to Bengbu has reduced its quartz powder cost by about 38% compared to Shanghai, due to locally sourced materials.

　　The quartz here was discovered in 1952. According to surveys by the Anhui Provincial Department of Industry, the quartz reserves in the Lion Mountain and Guanzi Mountain areas are extremely abundant; calculated at a monthly output of 1,000 tons, they can be mined for more than 48 years. Recently, quartz mines have been continuously discovered in the Dahong Mountain and Ma Mountain areas, covering forty square li, nearby. Chemical tests have proven that the quartz produced in this area contains 99.5% silicon dioxide.

　　Quartz is the main raw material for the glass industry. Quartz powder is also needed to manufacture refractory bricks for iron-smelting furnace linings and sand molds for recasting steel parts. (Collective Correspondents of this newspaper, Anhui Daily Editorial Department)

　　凤阳县生产大量石英
    安徽省凤阳县现在每月生产六百吨石英，供给南京、苏州、蚌埠等地玻璃、机械制造业应用。新从上海搬到蚌埠的一座公私合营玻璃厂，因为就地取材，石英粉成本费用比在上海降低百分之三十八左右。
    这里的石英，是一九五二年发现的。据安徽省工业厅勘察，在狮子山、冠子山一带石英的蕴藏量极为丰富，以月产一千吨计算，可以开采四十八年以上。最近又在附近的大红山、马山一带方圆四十里的山岗上，继续发现了石英矿。经化验证明：此地产的石英含二氧化矽百分之九十九点五。
    石英是玻璃工业的主要原料；制造炼铁炉内壁用的耐火砖和翻铸钢铁机件的砂模，也都需用石英粉末。　（本报集体通讯员安徽日报编辑部）
