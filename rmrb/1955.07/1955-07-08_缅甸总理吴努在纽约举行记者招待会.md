Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 7th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, who is currently visiting the United States, said at a press conference in New York on the 6th that he advocates direct negotiations between the United States and China to resolve the Far East crisis. On the same day, he told the Overseas Press Club in New York that he honestly believes that the Chinese people and government genuinely desire peace. He said he did not think the American people wanted war. He said he "believed it was not impossible to reach an understanding between China and the United States."

U Nu said at the press conference that he believed the heads of government of the four major powers would "not avoid discussing the Taiwan issue" at the Geneva Conference.

Someone asked him if he thought Asia should have representatives at the highest-level meeting. He replied, "This is a very important question. It would be very useful to have one or two representatives from Asia attend the meeting. It is never advisable to discuss issues in that region without Asian representatives participating."

U Nu also spoke about the issue of admitting the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.

U Nu also mentioned at the press conference that the Bandung Asian-African Conference played a significant role in easing world tensions. He emphasized that he does not approve of establishing blocs.

　　缅甸总理吴努在纽约举行记者招待会
    新华社七日讯　纽约消息：正在访问美国的缅甸总理吴努六日在纽约举行的记者招待会上说，他主张美国和中国直接谈判，以解决远东危机。同一天，他在纽约的海外记者俱乐部说，他诚实地相信中国人民和政府真正地要求和平。他说，他并不认为美国人民想要战争。他说，他“认为中国和美国之间取得谅解不是不可能的”。
    吴努在记者招待会上说，他认为四大国政府首脑在日内瓦会议上“不会避不讨论台湾问题”。
    有人问他是否认为亚洲应当有代表出席最高级会议。他回答说：“这是一个很重要的问题。会议有一个或者两三个来自亚洲的代表出席将是一件很有用的事情。在没有亚洲的代表参加的情况下讨论那个地区的问题永远是不可取的。”
    吴努并且谈到接纳中华人民共和国参加联合国的问题。
    吴努在记者招待会上还谈到，万隆亚非会议在缓和世界紧张局势方面起了重大的作用。他强调说，他不赞成建立集团。
