Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 20th. Antara News Agency reports: The Indonesian Central Election Committee has accepted 375 candidate lists submitted by various political parties, groups, or individuals.

    The Chairman of the Indonesian Central Election Committee, Hadi Kusumo, recently stated that the general elections for the Parliament and the Constitutional Assembly will be held on September 29th and December 15th this year, respectively, according to the scheduled dates. He emphasized that the work of the Central Election Committee is not affected by political developments.
    The "People's Daily" stated on the 19th that, currently, there is no other way to calm the domestic situation except to ensure the holding of the general election.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 20th. According to Indonesian newspapers, a group of senior army officers led by Colonel Lubis refused on the morning of the 18th to accept the compromise proposal put forward by the Indonesian government to resolve the army affair as soon as possible. The main contents of the Indonesian government's proposal were: Since the Minister of Defense has resigned, Colonel Lubis's suspension order is invalid; recognize Udoyo's assumption of the post of Army Chief of Staff for a certain period, after which Udoyo will resign; at the same time, the government will consider appointing a new Army Chief of Staff from the officers nominated by the army.
    "Indonesia News" reported on the 18th that political figures in Jakarta believe that certain foreign countries are extremely eager to see the situation in Indonesia deteriorate. Some foreigners hope that the army problem will bring down the current Indonesian cabinet, because they do not want a cabinet that pursues peace, opposes colonialism, and is friendly to other countries to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.
    The "Compass," the organ of the Indonesian opposition Socialist Party, has openly called for the Sastroamidjojo cabinet to resign. In the Parliament, the vote on the bill to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Federal Agreement has repeatedly failed to take place due to the boycott of opposition members.
    The Indonesian government's policy on resolving the army issue has been supported by people from all walks of life and many mass organizations. The Indonesian Communist Party, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, the Indonesian Peasants Front, the Indonesian People's Youth League, and the Association of Fighters for the True Independence of the Republic of Indonesia have all issued statements condemning actions that violate the Provisional Constitution and democratic principles of the Republic of Indonesia, and demanding that, in order to successfully carry out the general election work, and to defend and expand the interests of democracy and freedom, unity should be strengthened and expanded, and a high degree of vigilance should be maintained.

    印度尼西亚筹备国会和制宪议会选举工作
    印度尼西亚报纸揭露某些外国和反对党的倒阁阴谋
    新华社雅加达二十日电　据安塔拉通讯社消息：印度尼西亚中央选举委员会已经接受了由各政党、团体或个人所提出的三百七十五个候选人名单。
    印度尼西亚中央选举委员会主席哈迪库苏莫最近说，国会和制宪议会的大选将按照预定的日期分别在今年九月二十九日和十二月十五日举行。他着重指出，中央选举委员会进行的工作不受政局发展的影响。
    “人民日报”十九日说，目前除了保证举行大选外，没有其他方法可以使国内局面平静。
    新华社雅加达二十日电　据印度尼西亚报纸报道，以卢比斯上校为首的一批陆军高级军官已经在十八日上午拒绝接受印度尼西亚政府提出的为了早日解决陆军事件的折衷建议。印度尼西亚政府提出的建议的主要内容是：由于国防部长已经辞职，卢比斯上校的停职令无效；在一定时期内承认乌多约就任陆军参谋长之职，然后乌多约再提出辞职；同时政府将考虑从陆军方面提名的军官中任命一位新的陆军参谋长。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”在十八日的报道中说，雅加达的政界人士认为，某些外国极其希望看到印度尼西亚的局势恶化。某些外国人希望陆军问题能够搞垮目前的印度尼西亚内阁，因为他们不想让奉行和平、反对殖民主义以及同其他国家友好的政策的内阁来执行亚非会议的决议。
    印度尼西亚反对党社会党机关报“指南针报”已经公开要求沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁辞职。在国会中，由于反对党议员的抵制，印度尼西亚国会关于废除荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦议定书法案的表决一再未能举行。
    印度尼西亚政府解决陆军问题的政策受到各界人士和许多群众团体的支持。印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚总工会、印度尼西亚农民阵线、印度尼西亚人民青年团以及争取印度尼西亚共和国真正独立战士协会等组织都发表声明，谴责违背印度尼西亚共和国临时宪法和民主原则的行动，并且要求为了成功地进行大选工作，为了保卫和扩大民主和自由的利益，加强和扩大团结，保持高度的警惕。
