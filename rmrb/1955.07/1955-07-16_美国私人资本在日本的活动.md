Activities of American Private Capital in Japan
	Wu Xuewen

During my visit to Japan with the Chinese trade delegation, I, as a journalist, had extensive contact with Japanese capitalists, economists, and journalists and found that they generally expressed concern about the current Japanese economic situation. They deeply feel that one of the important issues in the Japanese economy today is the control of American capital. This control subordinates the Japanese economy to American military policy, making it unable to be independent and autonomous.

American capital's control over the Japanese economy is carried out in many ways. This article will only deal with the activities of American private capital in Japan, but even this shows how American capital, after the war, used the favorable position of the American occupation to penetrate every aspect of the Japanese economy and gain a position of control and dominance. American capital first controls Japan's foreign exchange through banks. Citibank, Chase, and the three major American banks all have branches in Japan. The power of the three major banks is distributed in Japan's major cities and commercial ports. Their deposit and loan amounts account for 90% of the total deposits and loans of foreign banks in Japan, occupying an absolute advantage in foreign exchange operations. After the war, the United States took advantage of the weakness of Japanese banks' own lack of foreign exchange and international connections and took the opportunity to enter. Even today, most of the foreign exchange used by the Japanese government or banks is controlled by American banks. 60 to 70 percent of Japan's annual thirteen billion dollar exports and twenty billion dollar imports of cash transactions are settled through the three major American banks. This not only allows American banks to obtain huge profits through deposits and loans, but more importantly, the United States controls Japan's foreign trade through foreign exchange. This is a very tight shackle for the Japanese economy, which lacks both raw materials and markets domestically and must rely on foreign trade to survive.

The Japanese bourgeoisie does not want to get rid of American control over foreign exchange. By the end of 1952, Japan had accumulated eight hundred million dollars in foreign exchange from only sixty-seven million dollars in 1950. In August 1954, the Bank of Tokyo was reorganized into a bank specializing in foreign exchange. An individual with qualifications in the Japanese economic circles said that the reorganization of the Bank of Tokyo shows Japan's attempt to restore the power of the Yokohama Specie Bank before the war in order to compete with foreign banks. Not only that, Japan is also preparing to restore free exchange with the pound sterling to reduce Japan's dependence on the United States in foreign exchange and trade.

The United States has tried its best to interfere with this trend of the Japanese economic community to seek autonomy in foreign exchange. First of all, it uses the favorable conditions of abundant capital and lower interest rates (2-2.5% per annum) to make it impossible for Japanese banks with weak capital and high interest rates (6-7% per annum) to compete with American banks. In addition, the United States exerts pressure and obstructs whenever Japanese banks show an inclination for autonomy - such as when the Japanese side proposed the issue of direct settlement of foreign exchange between the Bank of Tokyo and the Bank of China when the Chinese trade delegation to Japan negotiated a trade agreement.

The so-called "technical assistance" of American companies to Japanese companies and enterprises is an important way for American capital to penetrate Japanese industrial sectors and exert control. The so-called "technical assistance" is a cheap way for the United States to gain control over Japanese industrial sectors in the name of assisting Japanese industrial technology, without spending a penny and relying only on a few blueprints. As of March 1954, the number of "technical assistance" projects invested by foreign countries in Japanese industrial sectors reached 363. 57% of the total number of "technical assistance" projects were invested in the machinery industry, followed by chemical, metal, petroleum and other industrial sectors. 600 major Japanese companies or well-known manufacturers have accepted this "technical assistance." If these "technical assistance" projects are converted into monetary amounts according to American calculations, it would be approximately 240 million U.S. dollars, equivalent to six times the total amount of foreign capital's equity investment and securities purchases in Japan. Of the above 363 "technical assistance" projects, the United States accounts for 257, about 71%. The United States controls Japan's production sectors related to military industries through "technical assistance."

The profits obtained from "technical assistance" account for the overwhelming figure in the profits that foreign capital remits back to their home countries from Japan each year. Taking 1953 as an example, the profits from "technical assistance" accounted for 80% of the profit amount of 17.9 million U.S. dollars, about 14.32 million U.S. dollars. If calculated based on the international profit of 3% of long-term capital, the profit of "technical assistance" alone is equivalent to the profit amount from a long-term investment of 500 million U.S. dollars.

Japanese economists pointed out that "technical assistance," which has obtained such an alarming amount of profit, cannot truly solve the problem of Japan's industrial backwardness. Because the technology that the United States "assists" Japan with is not first-rate and new, but mostly outdated things in the United States. This "technical assistance" actually hinders Japan's production. In fact, the vast majority of Japanese manufacturers who accept American "technical assistance" cannot complete production as planned. In the one year from May 1952 to May 1953, of the 80 Japanese manufacturers who accepted "technical assistance," only 20 factories completed more than 80% of the original plan; 21 factories did not carry out production at all; and 39 factories only completed less than 60% of the original production plan. Factories that were completely unable to carry out production include factories of companies such as Daicel Chemical Industries, Furukawa Electric, New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Yawata Iron & Steel, Sumitomo Chemical, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, and Mitsui Mining & Smelting.

This situation of the United States using second-rate technology as capital to extract large amounts of profits from Japan every year cannot but arouse dissatisfaction in Japan, which is suffering from a lack of foreign exchange and an imbalance in international payments. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has stated, "In the future, the introduction of foreign capital should adopt a cautious and strict selection policy," and stated that "the introduction of technology after the war has come to an end," and "in the future, it will be limited to new technology aircraft and chemical fiber and petrochemical sectors."

The United States also carries out direct equity investment in Japanese industrial sectors and participates in management. As of the beginning of 1954, American equity investment in Japan accounted for 67% of the total value of foreign equity in Japan of 35.15 million U.S. dollars. American equity investment is concentrated in industrial sectors such as chemical, electrical machinery, and metal, which are directly related to the military industry. This investment is mainly to implement the American war policy of supporting the revival of Japanese militarism and making Japanese production militarized.

The United States' direct investment in the Japanese petroleum industry, aluminum manufacturing industry, and aircraft manufacturing industry is the best example of its support and control of the Japanese military industry. Foreign capital controls 53% of the shares of the nine Japanese oil companies, of which American capital occupies a dominant position. For example, Mobil Oil Company holds 55% of the shares in Toa Nenryo Kogyo; Texaco holds 50% of the shares in both Nippon Oil Refining and Koa Oil. These American companies belong to the Rockefeller financial system. In actual operation, they control 50% of the Japanese oil market. In the aluminum manufacturing industry, Alcan, which is controlled by the United States, holds more than 50% of the shares in Toyo Aluminium and Nippon Light Metal Company respectively; US based Puda Pava Zlo Company holds 50% of the shares in Nippon Strong Rivet Company. The proportion of American shares in the aircraft manufacturing industry is even greater. The American shares in Japan Aircraft Maintenance Company account for 72.7% of all shares.

In addition, the United States also invests indirectly in Japanese production sectors related to military production through loans. For example, the American bank lent 3.2 million U.S. dollars to Japan Airlines; lent 3 million U.S. dollars to Japanese shipping companies, Iino, Mitsui and other shipping companies; lent 7 million U.S. dollars to the Electric Power Development Company.

Whether it is American direct investment or indirect investment, or "technical assistance," it is obviously focused on military production and restricts the production of Japan's peaceful industries.

Many Japanese people have also shared with us their views on American capital in Japan. A powerful figure in the Japanese economic community said frankly that it is easiest to see from the economy that Japan is not independent. It still relies on the United States, especially American capital. A Japanese Doctor of Economics pointed out that today's Japanese economy is standing at the crossroads of military and peace. To develop peaceful industries, it is necessary to get rid of American restrictions and develop international trade. In Kansai, the head of an economic research institute said that Japan is indeed short of funds in rebuilding the economy, but Japan's economic independence cannot rely on American financial "assistance," and Japan does not welcome this kind of "assistance." These people's talks provide an answer to some Japanese bourgeoisie who want to find a way out by relying on American capital: The path to Japan's economic independence and autonomy in the future requires first getting rid of American control.

    美国私人资本在日本的活动
    吴学文
    在随中国贸易代表团访问日本期间，我作为一个新闻记者，曾和日本的资本家、经济学者、新闻记者进行了比较广泛的接触，发现他们对目前日本经济情势普遍表示忧虑。他们深切地感到，今天在日本经济中的重要问题之一是美国资本的控制。这种控制使日本经济隶属在美国的军事政策下，不能独立自主。
    美国资本对日本经济的控制是从多方面进行的。本文所要涉及的只是美国私人资本在日本的活动，但即此已可以看到美国资本在战后利用美国实行占领的有利地位，无孔不入地渗透到日本经济的各个方面，取得控制和支配的地位。美国的资本首先是通过银行控制着日本的外汇。美国的花旗、大通、美国三大银行在日本都设有分行，三大银行的势力分布在日本的主要城市和商埠，它的存放款金额占在日本外国银行存放款总额的百分之九十，在外汇经营方面占绝对优势。战后，美国利用日本银行本身缺乏外汇和国际联系的弱点，乘机而入。直到今天，日本政府或银行所动用的外汇，大部掌握在美国银行手里。日本每年输出十三亿美元和输入二十亿美元的现款交易中的百分之六十到七十的外汇，要通过美国三大银行来解决。这不仅使美国银行通过存放款得到庞大利润，而更主要的是美国通过外汇控制了日本的对外贸易。这对于国内既缺乏原料又缺乏市场、必须依靠对外贸易来维持生存的日本经济来说，是一道很紧的枷锁。
    日本资产阶级并不是不想在外汇上摆脱美国的控制的。到一九五二年底，日本已经从一九五○年的仅有的六千七百万美元外汇，积增到八亿美元。一九五四年八月，又把东京银行改组为专门办理外汇的银行。一位在日本经济界有资格的人士说，东京银行的改组，显示着日本要恢复战前横滨正金银行的势力以便和外国银行进行竞争的企图。不仅如此，日本还准备恢复和英镑的自由交换，以减轻日本的外汇和贸易的对美隶属性。
    美国对日本经济界企图在外汇上谋求自主的这一动向极力加以干涉。首先是它用资本雄厚、利息较低（年利二—二·五％）的有利条件，使资本薄弱和利息很高（年利六—七％）的日本银行无法和美国银行来竞争。此外，日本银行一表露自主的倾向——如在这次中国访日贸易代表团和日本经济界谈判贸易协定时，日方曾提出东京银行和中国银行直接结汇的问题，美国就施以压力，横加阻挠。
    美国公司对日本公司、企业的所谓“技术援助”是美国资本借以渗入日本产业部门进行支配的重要途径。所谓“技术援助”是美国以援助日本工业技术为名，不用分文，只凭几张蓝图就可以在日本的产业部门取得支配权的一种便宜的办法。到一九五四年三月为止，外国在日本产业部门投入的“技术援助”件数达三百六十三件，“技术援助”总件数的百分之五十七是投入机械工业，其次是化学、金属、石油等产业部门。日本的六百个主要公司或有名厂商都接受了这种“技术援助”。这些“技术援助”如果按照美国的算法换算为金额约为二亿四千万美元，相当于外国资本在日股份投资和购买证券全部金额的六倍。在上述三百六十三件“技术援助”中，美国占二百五十七件，约为百分之七十一。美国通过“技术援助”支配着日本的和军事工业有关的生产部门。
    “技术援助”所获得的利润，在外国资本每年由日本寄回本国的利润中占压倒的数字。以一九五三年为例，在一千七百九十万美元的利润额中，“技术援助”的利润占去百分之八十，约为一千四百三十二万美元。如果以长期资金的国际利润百分之三来计算，只是“技术援助”的利润，就相当于五亿美元长期投资所得利润额。
    日本的经济学者指出：获得了这样惊人数目利润的“技术援助”，并不能真正解决日本工业的落后问题。因为，美国所“援助”日本的技术，并不是头等的和新的，而多半是在美国国内已经过时的东西，这些“技术援助”反而对日本的生产起着阻碍作用。实际上，接受美国“技术援助”的日本厂商绝大部分不能按计划完成生产。从一九五二年五月到一九五三年五月一年间，接受“技术援助”的八十个日本厂商中，只有二十个工厂是完成原订计划的百分之八十以上；有二十一个工厂竟完全没有进行生产；有三十九个工厂只完成原订生产计划的百分之六十以下。完全没有能够进行生产的工厂中有大日本赛璐珞、古河电工、新三菱重工、八幡制铁、住友化学、东京芝浦电气、三菱造船、三井金属工业等公司的工厂。
    美国这种利用二流技术作为股本每年从日本吸取大批利润的情况，在苦于缺乏外汇、国际收支不平衡的日本不能不引起不满，所以日本大藏省曾声明，“今后的外资导入要采取慎重的严选主义”，并表示“战后的技术导入已告一段落”，“今后只限于新技术的飞机和化学纤维、石油化学部门”。
    美国还在日本的产业部门中进行直接的股份投资，并参加经营。到一九五四年初为止，美国在日本的股份投资占在日外资股份总值三千五百一十五万美元的百分之六十七。美国的股份投资集中在化学、电气机械、金属等和军需产业有直接关联的工业部门。这种投资主要的是为了执行美国扶植日本军国主义复活的战争政策，使日本的生产走向军事化。
    美国在日本石油业、铝制造业和飞机制造业中的直接投资，是最能说明它扶植并控制日本军需产业的例子。外国资本控制着日本的九个石油公司股份的百分之五十三，其中美国资本占支配地位。例如：美孚油公司在东亚燃料工业公司中占有股份百分之五十五；德士古石油公司在日本石油精制和兴亚石油两公司中各据有股份百分之五十。这些美国公司都是属于洛克菲勒财阀系统，在实际经营上，它们支配着日本石油市场的百分之五十。在铝制造业中，为美国所操纵的加拿大铝公司在东洋铝公司和日本轻金属公司中各据有股份百分之五十以上；美国的波达·怕瓦·兹洛公司在日本强力打钉扣公司中据有股份百分之五十。美国股份在飞机制造业中的比重更大，日本航空整备公司中的美国股份竟占去全部股份的百分之七十二点七。
    此外，美国还通过贷款方式向日本的和军火生产有关联的生产业部门进行间接的投资。例如：美国银行贷给大日本航空公司三百二十万美元；贷给日本商船、饭野、三井等船舶公司三百万美元；贷给电源开发公司七百万美元。
    无论是美国的直接投资还是间接投资，或者是“技术援助”，很明显地都是围绕着军事生产，束缚着日本的和平工业的生产。
    许多日本人士也曾和我们谈出他们对于在日本的美国资本的看法。一位日本经济界的有力人士坦率地说，从经济上最容易看出日本没有独立，它仍然依靠于美国，特别是美国资本。日本某经济学博士指出：今天的日本经济正站在军事与和平的十字路口，要发展和平产业就必须摆脱美国的限制，开展国际贸易。在关西，一位经济研究所的负责人说，在重建经济中日本的确是缺乏资金，但日本经济的自立不能依靠美国的资金“援助”，日本也不欢迎这种“援助”。这些人的谈话给想从依靠美国资本来找出路的一部分日本资产阶级以回答：今后日本经济独立自主的出路要求首先摆脱美国的控制。
