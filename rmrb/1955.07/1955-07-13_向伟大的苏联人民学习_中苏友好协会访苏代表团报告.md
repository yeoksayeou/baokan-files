Learn from the Great Soviet People
-- Report from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation to the Soviet Union
Wang Kunlun, Head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation to the Soviet Union

I.

In April of this year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters, at the invitation of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, organized a delegation to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day International Labor Day celebrations, visit various locations, and introduce the situation of New China to the Soviet people. The delegation consisted of twelve people, including representatives from political, economic, philosophical, literary, women's work, and cultural work fields. They departed from Beijing on April 27th and returned to Beijing on June 12th.

During their visit to the Soviet Union, the delegation visited four cities: Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (some comrades were also invited to visit the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic). They participated in the May Day parade in Red Square, paid respects at the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum, visited the Soviets of each city, toured seven factories and hydroelectric power stations, one state farm, and one collective farm, six scientific research institutions and schools, seven cultural, educational, and health facilities, twenty-six museums including revolutionary history, science and technology, and art, visited the Lenin Volga-Don Canal and the Moscow subway, and watched numerous song, dance, and drama performances. During their visit, the delegation also interviewed workers and collective farmers in their homes and engaged in extensive contact with people from all sectors of Soviet society.

In addition, at the request of Soviet friends, the delegates also gave a total of fifteen specialized reports in Moscow and Leningrad to Soviet academic circles, government officials, workers, students, and women on topics such as "The General Line of the Chinese Communist Party in the Transition Period," "State Capitalism in China during the Transition Period," "The Current Situation of Criticizing Bourgeois Idealist Thought in China," and "Chinese Women's Participation in the Construction of the Motherland," and held symposiums with writers in various places on the situation of New Chinese literature and Soviet literature in China.

Our delegation visited various locations in the Soviet Union for a total of twenty-seven days. Although the days in the Soviet Union were short, thanks to the proper arrangements made by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the specific assistance from relevant parties in various locations in the Soviet Union, our delegation was able to basically complete its work tasks according to the planned schedule. During this short period, we witnessed with our own eyes the Soviet people advancing victoriously along the road of communist construction and striving for increased production and conservation; we saw the Soviet people's intense and joyful outstanding labor, witnessed their ever-improving material and cultural life, and witnessed their united and firm struggle to defend world peace. We personally experienced the Soviet people's unparalleled care and deep, great friendship towards the Chinese people. In the great socialist country, in close contact with the Soviet people, we felt excited and happy at all times, and learned valuable knowledge and advanced experience. Our gains were rich, and the impression left on us by the Soviet people will never be erased.

II.

As soon as we set foot on the vast Soviet territory, we felt that we were in a new realm of life that had never existed in human history. The central goal of this magnificent and prosperous living realm, which is constantly developing, is to accelerate the pace towards a communist society from all aspects of industry, agriculture, culture, and education. When participating in the May Day parade in Red Square, we heard Marshal Zhukov's firm and sonorous words: "The Soviet people resolutely implement the resolutions of our party and devote all their strength to the noble cause of building a communist society, and constantly achieve new achievements in the further development of various departments of industry and agriculture, as well as science and culture. The Soviet people unanimously support the Communist Party's general line of prioritizing the development of heavy industry." The enthusiastic cheers that answered his call at the time concentratedly showed the firm will of the Soviet people that cannot be shaken.

This year is the last year of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan, and many departments have already completed the production tasks of the Five-Year Plan in four years ahead of schedule. Soviet industry surpasses previous achievements every year; the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government believe that only on the basis of developing heavy industry can the entire national economy be developed, and light industry and agriculture can be further developed. In order for the Soviet Union's national economy to smoothly transition from socialism to communism, it is necessary to correct shortcomings and make great strides forward on the basis of the successes already achieved. In mid-May of this year, the Soviet Union held the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers, affirmed the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, called for improving the quantity and quality of industrial production, striving to "ensure that there is not a single backward industrial sector or a single backward enterprise in the country," and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in certain industrial sectors. Now, all industrial sectors in the Soviet Union are launching a socialist competition, making concerted efforts to create new machines, products, and materials as soon as possible, create advanced working methods, widely promote advanced experience, strengthen and expand industrial automation, improve production organization, streamline personnel, practice strict economy, reduce costs, and strengthen "professional division of labor and collaboration."

In Moscow, we visited an automobile factory famous for producing the "Moskvich" small car. It produces 160 cars per day. In order to meet the increasing demand and improve product quality, it has now reformed and produced a new type of car, increasing horsepower to 35. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory was the first factory in Soviet history to produce tractors, which is the factory mentioned in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as being completed in the Stalingrad steppe in eleven months. By 1934, this factory was able to produce 100,000 tractors, fulfilling Lenin's great wish to produce 100,000 tractors. Now, all the factory workers are enthusiastically launching a labor competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Sevan Lake Hydroelectric Station we visited in the Armenian Republic is built 60 meters below the lake surface. It uses the water power of the 28 rivers flowing into the lake to generate a large amount of electricity. This is an automated industrial construction that vigorously conquers nature, and only four or five people are on duty in the underground power station, but the entire power station is operated in Yerevan, 60 kilometers away. When visiting the Moscow Museum of Diverse Industrial Technologies, we saw various new types of machines, including semi-automatic computers and electric computers, which can greatly save manpower calculation time, and the more highly efficient electronic computers are necessary tools for promoting the atomic industry. The curator of the museum told us: "The machines displayed in each department in this museum are constantly being replaced with new ones. If you come to see the content displayed here again in a year, it will be different." Soviet scientific research and industrial production are closely integrated, and the Soviet industrial and scientific departments are creating new achievements day by day and never stop.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government believe that in addition to a strong industry, there must also be a comprehensive agricultural development that can produce enough grain and raw materials to constantly supply industrial construction and meet the needs of the country and the people. The policy decided by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in January of this year is to increase the yield per unit area, vigorously reclaim wasteland, and develop animal husbandry. Grain production should reach a national total output of at least 10 billion poods per year by 1960 (one pood equals 16.38 kilograms); the sown area of virgin land and fallow land should increase from 17 million hectares in 1955 to 28 million to 30 million hectares in 1956; and animal husbandry should reach a level in the next few years that can guarantee the constantly growing needs of residents for food and industrial raw materials; efforts should be made to greatly improve the level of mechanization of livestock farms and implement the electrification of state farms. First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Khrushchev called out: "The tasks proposed by the January plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party will be completed in three to four years, instead of in six years as originally planned."

We visited the Second Gorki State Farm near Moscow, which had won the Lenin Medal, and it can be taken as a typical example of striving to increase production. The main task of this farm is to raise chickens and dairy cows. In 1954, it raised 30,000 chickens. Egg production was 6.7 million in 1953 and will increase to 7 million this year. By 1958, the number of chickens raised will increase to 50,000, and eggs will increase to 12 million; and it is necessary to improve quality and reduce costs. The farm raises 150 dairy cows. In 1954, the average milk production per cow was 6,120 kilograms. The famous individual good cow, "Vazha," produces 16,684 kilograms of milk per year. "Vazha" was exhibited at the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition last year and was rated as the All-Union Champion. Because of the farm's outstanding production performance, the All-Union Conference of State Farm Workers issued a bulletin calling on state farms across the country to learn from it and three other state farms. For example, in the Armenian "Builder" Collective Farm we visited, female member Magaryan was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union for exceeding the grape harvest by 140 percent.

Since the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made a decision in February and March of last year to further expand the reclamation of wasteland, a large-scale movement to respond to the Party's call to work hard to reclaim wasteland has been launched throughout the Soviet Union. On various transportation lines in the Soviet Union, we can often see many scientists, agronomists, tractor drivers, collective farmers, construction workers, government officials, and cultural workers led by party and league members, or young and strong single men and women, or families with both old and young, leaving their original positions and hometowns, full of confidence, not afraid of hardship, and for the needs of national production, batch after batch, they go to remote places with vast areas and no population to explore the rich potential of the land.

III.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the education of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet people's highly efficient outstanding labor and happy life with cultural education have become a shining example that all mankind commonly expects.

The working people of the entire Soviet Union are a labor army with a precise organization and conscious discipline, a whole that carries out construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government according to the national plan. When we come into contact with any individual part of this great whole, we see their constantly unremitting, tense and joyful labor appearance. Wherever we go, we feel that the Soviet people universally love their work and are proud of the part they play in the cause. When the director of the Moscow Small Horsepower Automobile Factory guides us to look at the new type of car, when the engineer of the Sevan Lake Hydroelectric Station points to the vast lake and explains how the lake water is controlled and serves the people, they themselves do not have the slightest self-satisfaction, but are full of glory for the creativity of the masses and their participation in this labor.

The Soviet working people have a high sense of responsibility for their work. Everyone regards creating new technologies, new working methods, improving production quantity and product quality, and saving national wealth as their greatest glory, and regards wasting financial and human resources as their shame, and they will inevitably be criticized. The rationalization proposal put forward by Belousov, an old worker at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, shortened a section of each crank-shaped shaft on the tractor, which can save 10 to 15 kilograms of metal, and saves the country 100,000 rubles per quarter. In the past, each shift (eight hours) could only forge 120 crank-shaped shafts, but now it can reach 350. This old hero, who has won the Labor Red Banner Medal and the Stalin Prize, is still enthusiastically studying how to manufacture lighter and more durable tractors, and to increase the production of tractors in greater quantities.

Each construction department in the Soviet Union is based on the principle of using the old foundation to engage in expansion and doing more with fewer people. Many old houses inside and outside Moscow and Leningrad are still being retained and utilized. Stalingrad, which had become ruins, has been rebuilt into a brand-new and glorious city in the past few years; for the sake of economic and residential convenience, the standard of general buildings is four to six floors. Factories, schools, and residential houses have been built, but the department in charge of urban construction is still an old house with war wounds, and has not built a beautiful building for itself. All the buildings in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, are made of local materials, using locally produced stones, with almost no wood seen, and reinforced concrete is also reduced to the minimum amount. The construction of the houses combines national forms, but the cost is low, practical and beautiful. There are only 1,200 construction workers in the city's reconstruction project. Opposite the hotel where we stayed in Moscow, a six-story children's department store is being built. We often only see three or four female workers standing on the wall directing the crane, but every few days we see that it has increased by one floor. This is how the Soviet people save the country's financial and human resources with highly efficient labor.

Being able to contribute more to labor will be materially and honorably rewarded according to the excellence of the achievements, and lead to a prosperous and happy life; however, the Soviet working people often maintain their simple life and frugal habits. We have visited the family of Remisov, the leader of the Leningrad Stalin Turbine Factory fitter commando team, and the family of an Armenian collective farmer, and we have personally seen their simple and beautiful life. What we should pay special attention to is that the improvement of the Soviet working people's lives is not manifested in the pursuit of purely material wealth, but is built on the basis of maintaining the noble qualities of diligence and simplicity and a high level of cultural attainment.

In any factory or rural area in the Soviet Union, there are various educational institutions and cultural facilities. The technical learning and cultural education of the working people has become an indispensable part of everyone's life. In various cities, there are cultural palaces distributed by district led by the trade union, which have become mass families for the working people to carry out spare-time study and cultural entertainment. In addition, there are various night universities, night schools, and correspondence schools, which enable workers to have the opportunity to generally improve themselves in their spare time. There are 60 cultural palaces in Leningrad, and the Gorky Cultural Palace, as one of the three major cultural palaces, is the center of cultural activities between several districts in the city. This grand five-story building has 5,000 young men and women and children every day, and 8,000 people on holidays come here. In this cultural palace, which is divided into dozens of departments, various different cultural activities and amateur studies are carried out at the same time. In the hall on this floor, people are dancing happily, while in many small reading rooms on another floor, many people are silently sitting under the green lampshades and burying themselves in reading. This is a corner of the Soviet people raising their culture from a popular basis.

Improving communist moral qualities is the main part of ideological education for the Soviet working people. The spirit of loving the motherland, loving labor, caring for children, respecting the elderly, valuing noble friendship, and valuing harmonious families is universally cultivated in all sectors of society. Wastefulness, laziness, selfishness, indiscipline, treating families with a bad attitude, alcoholism, and hooliganism are severely criticized. The Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers often carry out education in these aspects for young children. At the All-Soviet Art Exhibition, we saw a painting entitled "Sending Daughter to Work in Another Place," which sharply satirized university graduates who were unwilling to obey the organization's distribution and wanted to stay in big cities and their pampered families. The Gorky Cultural Palace in Leningrad, mentioned earlier, is recently holding a series of report meetings, with topics such as "What is Soviet Patriotism?", "The Soviet Family Must Be Consolidated," and "Why are Socialist Moral Qualities Nobler than Capitalist Moral Qualities?" In order to transition to a communist society, the Soviet people are constantly carrying out a firm struggle against the remnants of bourgeois ideology.

IV.

The Soviet people are filled with unparalleled love for their great motherland and the superior socialist system. They are constantly strengthening the power of their motherland and will never allow anyone to disrupt their peaceful and happy lives or hinder their far-reaching future. At the same time, the Soviet people deeply care about the difficult situation of the people of any country in the world and the struggle for peace, and have a fraternal and deep love for the people of peaceful, democratic, and socialist countries. After 37 years of engaging in heroic construction labor and resolutely fighting to defend peace, patriotism and internationalism have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the Soviet people, becoming an unbreakable natural emotion, and the people are united in one mind, forming the world's strongest and unparalleled fortress of peace.

In the cities, factories, rural areas, schools, and along the Siberian route we visited, we saw slogans such as "Peace Overcomes War" and "Give the World Peace." Our delegation was invited to participate in the last meeting of the Fifth All-Soviet Peace Defense Conference held in Moscow. The Column Hall of the Trade Union Building was filled with many peace fighters from all ethnic groups and professions from all over the Soviet Union, as well as representatives of different religions. In this meeting place filled with the enthusiastic atmosphere of fighting for peace, we deeply realized the strong will and great strength of the Soviet people to consolidate world peace, ease international tensions, and stop new wars.

Every moment we were in the Soviet Union, we were immersed in the deep enthusiasm of the Soviet people. Wherever our delegation passed, men, women, old and young waved to us, often surrounded us, or followed us all the way; even if the language was not understandable, the enthusiastic eyes, strong handshakes, and affectionate hugs moved our hearts. On Red Square on May Day, a twelve-year-old girl named Galia came to us and said: "I love the Chinese people, so I came to talk to you myself." She wrote in a comrade's notebook: "I came to Red Square on May Day and met the representatives of the People's Republic of China. I hope that the friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people will be further consolidated, so that we can help the people of both countries overcome all difficulties. I wish this friendship will be further consolidated!" At the farewell banquet in Yerevan, an eighty-year-old poet, Isaacyan, who rarely goes out, made a long speech, recounting that the Armenian people began economic and cultural exchanges with China two thousand years ago. He sat with us until after 2:00 am, and excitedly got up and danced with us. At the farewell banquet in Moscow, Zoya's mother said that she had been constantly receiving letters from Chinese youth and Young Pioneers for several years. She said: "I can no longer hear my own children calling me 'Mom,' but at the beginning of these letters, they all call me 'Dear Mom,' and at the end, they all write 'A group of your black-haired and black-eyed children.' These black-haired and black-eyed children have become my dear children. Please express my sincere maternal respect to the Chinese youth and children!" We must convey the loving voice of this great mother to every young person and child in China.

The Soviet people's love for the Chinese people is endless, especially their respect and care for our great leader Chairman Mao. Wherever we went, people often came to ask about Chairman Mao's health. Whenever the name "Mao Zedong" was mentioned, enthusiastic applause or cheers immediately rang out from the crowd. The Soviet people have strong confidence and infinite expectations for the Chinese people who are carrying out socialist construction and defending peace under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. At the same time, the Soviet people are very concerned about our just struggle against US imperialism's occupation of our territory - Taiwan; whenever we said that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and have the strength to repel aggression, they were very excited and gratified.

In the cultural palaces, libraries, and small reading rooms of some hospitals, schools, factories, farms, and airports we visited, we often saw some Chinese publications and newspapers, as well as Russian translations of Chinese literary works. In the reading room of the Armenian "Builder" Collective Farm, we saw an Armenian translation of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The writers our delegation visited in various places said that they have translated and are about to translate some Chinese classical literary works and works by modern writers. The reports our delegation made to the Soviet people about the situation in New China were warmly welcomed by them. They raised many specific questions, caring about how the Chinese people are implementing the general line for the transition period put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, how to carry out the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought, and caring about the development of Chinese literature, as well as the lives of women and children, etc. They expressed that in addition to us learning from them, they also want to learn from us, so that the culture of the two countries can be enriched even further. All of this shows the Soviet people's universal concern for China, and at the same time reflects that the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is being further enhanced.

V.

Our delegation's visit to the Soviet Union this time has gained rich knowledge and profound feelings. We deeply thank the Soviet people for their enthusiasm and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and all relevant parties in the Soviet Union for their assistance and hospitality. Now we have left our great ally, the Soviet Union, and returned to our beloved motherland. In our increasingly strong and progressive motherland, the great construction of the first Five-Year Plan is underway, the movement to increase production and practice economy and oppose waste is being launched, the work of uniting with the peace-loving countries and people is being carried out, and the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements is being launched, which makes us deeply feel that we must be good at closely combining the specific circumstances of China and further learn from the Soviet Union.

We must learn from the Soviet people's highly efficient outstanding labor and advanced science and technology and working methods, especially their consistent spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste, in order to improve our production, create and accumulate national wealth, save manpower and material resources, and complete our first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule with redoubled efforts.

We must learn from the Soviet people's noble qualities of diligence and simplicity, and hard work.

We must learn from the Soviet people's spirit of always uniting and supporting the Party and the Soviet government, and resolutely opposing the struggle of domestic enemies, resolutely support the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and completely eliminate internal enemies.

We must learn from the Soviet people's unparalleled determination to love the motherland and defend world peace, resolutely liberate our territory Taiwan, oppose US imperialist aggression, and defend lasting peace in Asia and the world.

We must further strengthen and consolidate the greatest and deepest friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and all relevant parties must also, based on the new situation of the Soviet Union's development in various aspects and the learning gained by this delegation, strive to publicize and introduce it to the people of the whole country; and in the future, we should introduce China's construction situation from various different departments to the Soviet people in a more systematic way, and strive to adapt to the Soviet people's requirements for specific understanding of us and answer the Soviet people's eager expectations for us, in order to promote the further consolidation and development of the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    向伟大的苏联人民学习
    ——中苏友好协会访苏代表团报告
    中苏友好协会访苏代表团团长　王昆仑
    一
    今年四月，中苏友好协会总会应苏联对外文化协会的邀请，组织了访苏代表团，赴苏参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼，到各地参观访问，并向苏联人民介绍新中国的情况。代表团十二人，其中包括政治、经济、哲学、文学、妇女工作和文化工作等方面的代表。四月二十七日离京赴苏，六月十二日回到北京。
    在访苏期间，代表团先后到了莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒和亚美尼亚加盟共和国的首都埃里温等四个城市（个别同志还应邀访问了立陶宛加盟共和国），参加了红场的“五一”观礼，拜谒了列宁斯大林陵墓，访问了各城市的苏维埃，参观了七处工厂和水电站、一个国营农场和一个集体农庄、六个科学研究机关和学校、七处文教卫生设施、二十六处包括革命历史性、科学技术性与文艺性的博物馆，游览了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河和莫斯科的地下铁道，并看了多次的歌舞戏剧等表演。在访苏期间，代表团还专访过工人和集体农民的家庭，与苏联社会各方面的人士进行了广泛的接触。
    此外，应苏联朋友的要求，代表们又分别在莫斯科和列宁格勒向苏联学术界、机关干部、工人、学生及妇女等作过关于“中国共产党在过渡时期的总路线”、“中国在过渡时期的国家资本主义”、“目前中国批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的情况”和“中国妇女参加祖国建设的情况”等专题报告共十五次，并与各地的作家举行过有关新中国文学和苏联文学在中国情况的座谈会。
    我们的代表团在苏联各地参观访问共二十七天。访苏的日子虽很短促，可是由于苏联对外文化协会的妥善安排和苏联各地有关方面的具体协助，使我们代表团能依照预定的计划基本上完成了工作任务。在这短促的期间，我们亲眼看到了苏联人民沿着共产主义建设的道路胜利迈进，为了增产和节约而斗争；看到了苏联人民紧张而又愉快的卓越劳动，看到了他们日益提高的物质和文化生活，看到了他们为了保卫世界和平所做的团结一致和坚强的斗争，我们更亲身体会到苏联人民对中国人民无比的亲切关怀和深厚伟大的友谊。在伟大的社会主义国家里，在和苏联人民亲密的接触中，使我们无时无刻不感到兴奋、愉快，学习到宝贵的知识和先进的经验。我们的收获是丰富的，苏联人民给我们留下的印象是永远不能磨灭的。
    二
    我们一踏上辽阔广大的苏联国土，就感觉到自己是置身在人类历史上从未有过的崭新的生活境界中。这个雄伟繁荣的生活境界不断发展的中心目标，就是从工业、农业、文化、教育等各个方面都加紧脚步向着共产主义社会前进。当参加红场“五一”观礼时，我们听到了朱可夫元帅坚毅宏亮的语言：“苏联人民坚决贯彻我们党的决议，以全部力量致力于建设共产主义社会的崇高事业，在进一步发展工农业各部门和科学、文化方面不断取得新的成就。苏联人民一致支持共产党优先发展重工业的总路线。”当时回答他这种号召的是一片热烈的欢呼，集中地显示出苏联人民不可动摇的坚强意志。
    今年是苏联第五个五年计划的最后的一年，有不少的部门已经提前在四年内完成了五年计划的生产任务。苏联工业每年都超过以往的成就；苏联共产党和苏联政府认为只有在发展重工业的基础上才能发展整个的国民经济，并使轻工业和农业得到进一步的发展。为了使苏联的国民经济能够顺利地从社会主义过渡到共产主义，必须在已经达到的成功的基础上，纠正缺点，大踏步前进。今年五月中旬，苏联举行了全苏工业工作人员会议，肯定了提前完成五年计划，号召提高工业生产的数量和质量，要争取“使全国没有一个落后的工业部门，没有一个落后的企业”，要在某几项工业部门，超过最发达的资本主义国家。现在全苏联各工业部门正在展开社会主义竞赛，为了尽速创制新的机器、产品、材料，创造先进工作方法，广泛推广先进经验，加强扩大工业自动化，改进生产组织，精简人员，厉行节约，减低成本和加强“专业分工和协同合作”而一致努力。
    在莫斯科，我们参观了一个以出产“莫斯科人”小型汽车出名的汽车厂。它每天生产汽车一百六十辆，为了适应日益普遍的需要和改进产品质量，现已改制出新型的汽车，将马力增加到三十五匹。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂，是苏联历史上第一个出产拖拉机的工厂，也就是“联共党史”上所说到的用十一个月的工夫在斯大林格勒草原上建设完成了的工厂。一九三四年这个厂已能生产十万台拖拉机，完成了从前列宁要生产十万台拖拉机的伟大愿望。现在全厂职工正为提前完成五年计划而热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。我们在亚美尼亚共和国参观的色万湖水电站，建在湖面之下六十公尺的地方，它利用流入湖中的二十八条河的水力来大量发电。这是一个大力征服自然的自动化的工业建设，而在地下发电站里只有四、五个人值班，整个电站操纵却在六十公里以外的埃里温城里。在参观莫斯科多种工业技术博物馆的时候，我们看到了各种新型的机器，其中有半自动化的计算机和电动计算机，可以大大地节约人力的计算时间，而具有更高度效能的电子计算机是正在推行原子工业所必需的工具。博物馆馆长对我们说：“这个馆里所陈列的各部门的机器，是不断地用新的来代替旧的，今天所陈列的内容，你们再过一年来看，就要不同了。”苏联的科学研究和工业生产是密切结合在一起的，苏联的工业和科学部门是日新月异永不停息地在创造着新的成就。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府认为除了强大的工业之外，还必须有全面发展的农业，能够生产足够的粮食和原料，经常供应工业建设和满足国家和人民的需要。今年一月苏联共产党中央全体会议决定的方针是提高单位面积产量，大力开垦荒地和发展畜牧业。谷物生产要在一九六○年达到全国总产量至少每年一百亿普特的水平（一普特等于一六·三八公斤）；要在一九五六年把生荒地和熟荒地的播种面积从一九五五年的一千七百万公顷达到两千八百万至三千万公顷；要在最近几年内使畜牧业达到能够保证满足居民食品和工业原料不断增长的需要水平；要大力提高畜牧农场的机械化水平和实施国营农场的电气化。苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫号召说：“党中央一月全体会议所提出的任务，将不是像预定的那样在六年中完成，而是在三—四年中完成。”
    我们参观过曾经荣获列宁勋章的莫斯科近郊第二高尔克国营农场，可以作为努力增产的典型例证之一。这个农场的任务主要是饲养鸡和乳牛。一九五四年养有三万只鸡。鸡蛋产量一九五三年是六百七十万个，今年要增加到七百万个。到一九五八年养鸡要增加到五万只，鸡蛋要增加到一千二百万个；并且要提高质量、降低成本。农场养母牛一百五十头。一九五四年平均每头牛的乳量是六千一百二十公斤，著名的个别的好牛像“瓦札”每年产乳量是一万六千六百八十四公斤。“瓦札”曾在去年苏联农业展览会中展览，经评定当选为全苏冠军。由于这个农场生产成绩卓越，苏联全国国营农场工作会议发出布告，号召全国国营农场向它和其他三个国营农场学习。又如我们访问过的亚美尼亚“建设者”集体农庄，女庄员马加梁即因葡萄的收获量超过百分之一百四十，得到苏联社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    自从去年二、三月苏联共产党中央全体会议作了进一步扩大开垦荒地的决议之后，在全苏联展开了大规模的响应党的号召努力开荒的运动。在苏联的各个交通线上常常可以看到由党、团员带头的许许多多的科学家、农学家、拖拉机手、集体农民、建筑工人、机关干部以及文化工作人员，或是年青力壮的单身男女，或是老幼都有的一家人，离开自己原有的岗位和家乡，满怀信心、不怕艰苦，为国家生产的需要，一批一批地走向面积广阔、没有人烟的辽远的地方去发掘雄厚的土地潜力。
    三
    在苏联共产党的领导和马克思列宁主义的教育之下，苏联人民高度效能的卓越劳动和富有文化教养的幸福生活，成为全人类共同期望的光辉榜样。
    全苏联劳动人民是一支有精密组织有自觉纪律的劳动大军，是一个在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导之下按照国家计划进行建设事业的整体。我们接触着这个伟大整体的任何个别部分，都看到他们经常不懈的紧张而愉快的劳动姿容。我们走到任何地方都感觉到苏联人民普遍的热爱着自己的工作，并且都以自己参加的那一份事业而自豪。莫斯科小马力汽车制造厂的厂长指引我们看着新型的汽车的时候，色万湖水电站的工程师指着那广阔的湖水说明湖水被控制而为人民服务的时候，他们自己并没有丝毫的自满，可是却充满了对群众的创造和自己参加这种劳动的光荣感觉。
    苏联劳动人民对自己的工作都有高度的责任感。人人都把创造新技术、新工作方法，提高生产数量和产品质量，节约国家财富当作自己最大的光荣，而把浪费财力和人力看成为自己的耻辱，并且也必然要受到批评。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的老工人别洛乌索夫提出的合理化建议，使拖拉机上的每一个曲形轴截短了一段，可以节省金属十公斤到十五公斤，每一季为国家节约十万卢布。过去每一班（八小时）只能锻成曲形轴一百二十个，现在可以达到三百五十个。这个荣获劳动红旗勋章和斯大林奖金的老英雄，还正在热心研究怎样制造出更轻便的、更耐用的拖拉机，并且更大量增加拖拉机的产量。
    苏联每个建设部门，都是以利用旧基础来从事扩建和以更少的人做更多的事为原则。莫斯科和列宁格勒市内外还有不少的旧房子被保留和被利用着。曾经变成为废墟的斯大林格勒，战后几年来已经重建成为一个崭新辉煌的城市；为了经济和居住的方便，一般楼房的标准是四层到六层。工厂、学校、居民住宅都已兴建起来了，可是主管城市建筑的机关至今仍是一所带有战争创伤的旧房子，并没有给自己盖一所漂亮的大楼。亚美尼亚首都埃里温所有的建筑都是就地取材，使用本地出产的石头，几乎完全看不见木料，钢筋混凝土也减少到最低数量。房屋的建筑是结合民族形式的，但造价低廉，适用而又美观。在全市进行着改建的工程中，只有一千二百个建筑工人。我们在莫斯科所住旅馆的对面，正在建筑一座六层楼的儿童百货商店，经常只看见三、四个女工站在墙上指挥起重机，可是每过几天就看到增高了一层楼。苏联人民就是这样以高度效能的劳动来节约国家的财力和人力。
    能够在劳动上多贡献，就会按照成就的优异得到物质和荣誉的奖励，过到富裕和幸福的生活；可是苏联劳动人民经常保持着他们俭朴的生活和节约的习惯。我们曾访问过列宁格勒斯大林透平机工厂钳工突击队队长列米索夫的家庭和亚美尼亚集体农民的家庭，亲眼看到了他们的朴素而又美好的生活。我们所应该特别重视的，是苏联劳动人民生活的提高，不是表现在单纯物质富裕的追求上，而是建筑在保持勤劳朴素的高尚品质和高度的文化素养的基础上的。
    在苏联任何工厂、农村都有各种教育机构和文化设施。劳动人民的技术学习和文化教育成为每一个人生活中所不可缺少的一部分。在各城市都有职工会所领导的按区分布的文化宫，成为劳动人民进行业余学习和文化娱乐的群众大家庭。此外还有各种夜大学、夜校和函授学校，使得职工在业余之暇能有普遍进修的机会。列宁格勒全市就有六十个文化宫，作为三大文化宫之一的高尔基文化宫是市内某几个区之间的文化活动中心。这一座规模宏大的五层楼房，每天有男女青年和少年儿童五千人，假日有八千人走到这里来。在这一座分成几十个部门的文化宫里，同一时间内分别进行着各种不同的文化活动和业余学习，这一层楼的大厅里欢天喜地跳着舞，另一层楼许多小阅览室里却有很多人寂静无声地坐在绿罩子的灯底下埋头看书。这就是苏联人民从普及的基础上提高文化的一角。
    提高共产主义道德品质是苏联劳动人民思想教育中的主要部分，在社会各个部门里普遍地培养着爱祖国、爱劳动、爱护儿童、尊敬老人、重视高尚友谊和重视和睦家庭的精神。严厉地批判着浪费、懒惰、自私、不守纪律、以恶劣态度对待家庭、酗酒和流氓等等的行为。共青团、少先队经常进行着对少年儿童这些方面的教育工作。我们在全苏艺术展览会上看到一幅题名为“把女儿派到外地去工作”的画，尖锐地讽刺了不愿服从组织分配而要留在大城市里生活的大学毕业生和娇惯她的家庭。前面说到过的列宁格勒高尔基文化宫，最近正举行着一系列的报告会，有“什么是苏维埃的爱国主义精神？”、“必须巩固苏维埃家庭”、“社会主义道德品质为什么比资本主义道德品质高尚？”等等讲题。为了过渡到共产主义社会，苏联人民对于资产阶级思想意识的残余是在不断地进行着坚决的斗争。

    苏联人民对自己伟大的祖国和优越的社会主义制度充满了无比的热爱，他们不断地加强自己祖国的威力，绝不容许任何人来破坏他们和平幸福的生活，阻碍他们远大的前途。同时，苏联人民深切关怀着全世界任何国家的人民艰难的处境和争取和平的斗争，对于和平、民主和社会主义国家的人民更具有兄弟般深切的热爱。经过三十七年从事英勇的建设劳动和保卫和平的坚决斗争，爱国主义和国际主义已经深植在苏联人民的心灵里，成为牢不可破的自然情感，万众一心，形成了全世界坚强无比的和平堡垒。
    我们所到的城市、工厂、农村、学校以及西伯利亚沿途，到处都看到“和平战胜战争”、“给世界以和平”的标语。我们代表团被邀请参加了在莫斯科举行的第五届全苏保卫和平大会最后一次会议，在工会大厦的圆柱大厅里坐满了来自苏联各地各民族各种职业的以及代表不同宗教的许多和平战士。在这个充满了为和平而战斗的热烈气氛的会场中，我们深切认识到苏联人民巩固世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势、制止新的战争的坚强意志和伟大力量。
    我们在苏联每时每刻都沉浸在苏联人民深厚的热情里。我们代表团路过之处，男女老幼都和我们招手，经常把我们包围起来，或一路跟着我们走；即使言语不通，热情的眼睛、有力的握手、亲切的拥抱都感动着我们的心。在“五一”节的红场上，一个名叫加丽娅的十二岁的小女孩走到我们面前来说：“我爱中国人，所以自己走来和你们谈话。”她在我们一位同志的小本子上写道：“五一节我到红场上来了，认识了中华人民共和国的代表们。我希望苏联人民和中国人民的友谊更加巩固，这样就能帮助两国人民克服一切困难。祝这种友谊更加巩固吧！”在埃里温临别的宴会上，一位很少出门的八十岁的老诗人伊萨阿克扬做了长篇的发言，叙述着亚美尼亚人民在两千年前就开始了和中国经济文化的交流，他一直和我们坐到半夜两点多钟，而且兴奋地起来和我们一起跳舞。在莫斯科临别的宴会上，卓娅的妈妈说，她几年来不断地接到中国青年和少先队员们给她的信。她说：“我已经再听不到自己的亲生的儿女呼唤我‘妈妈’的声音了，可是在这些来信的开头都叫我‘亲爱的妈妈’，末尾都写着‘你的一群黑头发黑眼珠的孩子们’，这些黑头发黑眼珠的孩子们成了我亲爱的儿女了。请你们为我向中国青年儿童们表示我赤诚的母亲的敬意吧！”我们一定要把她这位伟大的母亲的慈爱的声音传达给中国的每一个青年和小朋友。
    苏联人民对中国人民的热爱是说不尽的，特别是他们对我们伟大领袖毛主席的敬爱和关怀。无论我们到哪里，都常有人专诚地来问毛主席的健康。每当提到“毛泽东”的名字，群众中就立刻响起热烈的掌声或欢呼。苏联人民对于在毛主席和中国共产党领导下进行着社会主义建设和保卫和平的中国人民，怀抱着坚强的信心和无穷的热望。同时，苏联人民对于我们反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土——台湾的正义斗争，是非常关心的；每当我们说到中国人民一定要解放台湾，有力量击退侵略，他们就非常兴奋、欣慰。
    在我们所到过的文化宫、图书馆以及有些医院、学校、工厂、农庄和飞机场的小阅览室里，都常看到中国出版的某些刊物和报纸，以及中国文艺作品的俄文译本。在亚美尼亚“建设者”集体农庄的阅览室里看到有亚美尼亚文译本的“毛泽东选集”。我们的代表团访问各地的作家们，他们都说出他们已经翻译和正要翻译中国某些古典文艺作品和现代作家的作品。我们的代表团向苏联人民作关于新中国情况的报告，受到他们热烈欢迎。他们提出了许多的具体问题，关心着中国人民在如何贯彻着中国共产党和毛主席所提出的过渡时期的总路线，如何对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，如何进行反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争，关心着中国文学的发展，以及妇女、儿童的生活等等。他们表示除我们向他们学习之外，他们也要向我们学习，只有这样才能使两国的文化更加丰富起来。这一切一切都说明苏联人民对中国普遍的关心，同时反映了中苏两国人民的友谊正在更进一步地增进。

    我们代表团这次到苏联参观访问，获得了丰富的知识和深刻的感受，我们深深感谢苏联人民对我们的热情和苏联对外文化协会以及苏联各有关方面的帮助和款待。现在我们离开了我们伟大的盟邦苏联回到自己亲爱的祖国来了。在我们日益强大日益进步的祖国，正在进行着伟大的第一个五年计划的建设，正在展开增产节约反对浪费的运动，正在展开与爱好和平的国家人民团结友好的工作，正在展开肃清胡风反革命集团和一切潜藏的反革命分子的斗争，这就更使我们深切感到必须善于密切结合中国的具体情况进一步地向苏联学习。
    我们要学习苏联人民高度效能的卓越劳动和先进的科学技术与工作方法，特别是他们一贯的增产节约反对浪费的精神，以提高我们的生产，创造和积累国家财富，节约人力物力，并以加倍的努力来提前完成我们的第一个五年计划。
    我们要学习苏联人民勤劳朴素、艰苦奋斗的高尚品质。
    我们要学习苏联人民从来团结一致拥护党和苏维埃政府，坚决反对国内敌人的斗争的精神，坚决拥护我们的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，严厉镇压反革命，彻底消灭内部的敌人。
    我们要学习苏联人民热爱祖国、保卫世界和平无比的决心，坚决解放我们的领土台湾，反对美帝国主义侵略，以保卫亚洲和全世界的持久和平。
    我们更要进一步地加强和巩固中苏两国人民之间的最伟大最深厚的友谊。我们中苏友好协会以及各有关方面，还要根据苏联在各方面发展的新情况和这次代表团学习所得，努力向全国人民作宣传和介绍；并且，以后应当把中国的建设情况从各个不同的部门更有系统地向苏联人民介绍，力求适应苏联人民对我们具体了解的要求，回答苏联人民对我们的热望，以促进中苏两国人民伟大友谊的更进一步的巩固和发展。　（新华社）
