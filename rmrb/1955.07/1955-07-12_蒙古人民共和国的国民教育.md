National Education in the Mongolian People's Republic
Leader and Director of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble, Dun Rubu·Damdinhu

Pre-revolutionary Mongolia was considered one of the most backward countries in Asia. There were more than 700 lama temples in the country, but not even a primary school for the children of the working people. Secondary and higher education were even more out of the question. Less than one percent of the country's 800,000 people were literate.

The People's Revolution of 1921 eliminated the regime of a handful of feudal lords, the betrayers of national interests, who were hated by the people, and drove the lackeys of imperialism out of the country. The people's democratic system that emerged from this revolution opened up broad avenues for Mongolian youth and all the people to acquire modern knowledge. What Mongolian youth could only dream of before the revolution has now been realized.

Since the victory of the Revolution in 1921, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government have tirelessly cared for the welfare of the people and the improvement of their cultural level. In this very important cause of our country, as well as in other aspects of building a new life, the people of our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, have given and are giving our country invaluable assistance. In these past years, major changes have taken place in the lives of the Mongolian people, changes that have determined the rapid advancement of the Mongolian people along the path of progress and prosperity. A broad network of schools and other cultural and educational institutions has been established, illiteracy among adults has been almost completely eradicated, higher education is developing rapidly, the number of scientific research institutions is constantly increasing, and many domestic scientific cadres have emerged.

Now, one in ten residents is studying in general education schools, and one in three hundred is studying in higher education institutions. At present, there are 422 general education schools in the country, with more than 72,000 children of working people studying in them. In the last seven years alone, from 1947 to 1954, 33 new primary schools, 32 general secondary schools, 3 technical secondary schools, and 1 higher education institution were newly built. The number of graduates from seven-year schools has increased by 90 percent, and the number of graduates from ten-year schools has increased by 18 times.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government have shown great concern for children. The state has established many kindergartens and nurseries for preschool children. In 1954, the number of children entering kindergartens and nurseries increased by 1.6 times compared to 1947, and the number of kindergartens increased by 80 percent. Schools are equipped with children's care facilities where students can live throughout the school year. The government allocates a large amount of funds each year to build new schools and nurseries.

All types of school education are free of charge. All students in technical secondary schools and higher education institutions receive monthly stipends.

In 1954, the government allocated 70 percent more funds for people's education than in 1947, and 266 percent more funds for school and nursery construction. Students can get enough textbooks. In recent years alone, 69 kinds of textbooks have been published, totaling nearly three million copies.

The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, held in November 1954, adopted the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture. The plan stipulates that all school-age children in rural areas should receive compulsory primary education, and children in large cities should receive compulsory seven-year education. During the second five-year plan period, it is planned to build 28 new primary schools, 24 seven-year schools, and 12 ten-year schools. By the end of 1957, the number of students in general education schools will reach 85,000. The quality of teachers is improving year by year. The number of teachers with higher specialized education in 1954 almost increased fivefold compared to 1947. At the end of the 1954-1955 academic year alone, 200 teachers with high cultural levels will graduate from the Education Department of the National University and the Teachers College. In recent years, the government has taken many important measures to improve the quality of teachers. Correspondence courses have been established in teachers' colleges for primary school teachers, regular tutoring is organized in ten-year schools, and part-time refresher courses are organized in the National Teachers College for secondary school teachers.

In order to improve the quality of teachers, short-term training courses are organized during the summer vacation, and regular publications such as "Teacher," teacher reference materials, and other teaching materials are published. Great importance is attached to introducing the work experience of outstanding teachers and promoting the work experience of Soviet teachers. The evaluation of primary and secondary schools, which began in 1953, ended in December 1954. All these measures have had a positive impact on improving the quality of education in schools. Students' extracurricular and out-of-school work is one of the important links in improving school education.

Literary groups, carpentry groups, technical groups, young natural scientist groups, young geographer groups, mathematics groups, etc. are organized in schools. In addition, there are sports groups, song and dance groups, chess and music groups. The amateur entertainment groups of rural school students have achieved great success in their performances among herdsmen. Outstanding members of secondary school amateur entertainment groups have participated in the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. For example, Majigesuren, a seventh-grade girl from the Second Ten-Year School in Ulaanbaatar, has participated in the festival many times.

Many children's reading rooms have been set up. The Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League and the Young Pioneers organizations occupy an important position in school life. At their initiative, with the support of school leaders and parents' committees, parties are often held in schools, and get-togethers are organized with advanced producers, outstanding writers, actors, meritorious teachers of the Republic, veteran heroes of the People's Revolution, and participants in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1936-1939 and 1945. In addition, physics evenings, chemistry evenings, biology evenings, mathematics evenings, and evenings commemorating festivals and great representatives of science, technology, and literature are often held.

The tasks facing general education schools are arduous. They must further improve the educational work of schools in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which inspires the Mongolian people to strive for new achievements in socialist construction.

All teachers in the Mongolian People's Republic are determined to successfully complete these tasks with the support and assistance of teachers in the Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democracies.

    蒙古人民共和国的国民教育
    蒙古人民革命军歌舞团领队兼团长　敦儒布·达姆丁呼
    革命前的蒙古被认为是亚洲最落后的国家之一，国内有七百多个喇嘛庙，却连一所可供劳动人民子弟上学的小学校都没有，至于中等和高等学校就更谈不上了。全国八十万人口中识字的人不到百分之一。
    一九二一年的人民革命消灭了人民憎恨的一小撮封建主——民族利益出卖者的政权，并将帝国主义的佣仆驱出国境。在这次革命中产生的人民民主制度，为蒙古青年和全体人民开辟了获得现代知识的广阔道路。革命前蒙古青年只能幻想的事情已经实现了。
    自一九二一年革命胜利以来，蒙古人民革命党和人民政府不倦地关怀人民的福利和文化水平的提高。无论在对我国这项十分重要的事业方面，也无论在建设新生活的其他方面，我们伟大的邻邦——苏联的人民给了并正在给予我国难以估价的帮助。在过去的这些年代里，在蒙古人民的生活中发生了重大的变化，这些变化决定了蒙古人民沿着进步和繁荣的道路迅速前进。广泛的学校网和其他的文化教育机关网已经建立，成年人中的文盲几乎已完全肃清，高等教育事业正在迅速地发展，科学研究机关的数量在不断地增加，并出现了许多本国的科学干部。
    现在每十个居民中有一个人在普通教育学校学习，每三百个人中有一个人在高等学校学习。目前国内有普通教育学校四百二十二个，在校学习的劳动人民的子弟有七万二千多人。仅在最近七年内，即自一九四七年到一九五四年，又新建了三十三所小学校、三十二所普通中学、三所技术专科学校和一所高等学校。七年制学校毕业生的数量增加了百分之九十，十年制学校毕业生的数量增加了十八倍。
    蒙古人民革命党和人民政府对于儿童表现了极大的关怀。国家为学龄前的儿童建立了许多幼儿园和托儿所。一九五四年进幼儿园和托儿所的儿童的数量比一九四七年增加了一点六倍，幼儿园的数量增加了百分之八十。学校里设有儿童保育院，学生在整个学年内可以住在那里。政府每年拨出大批款项来建设新的学校和保育院。
    各种类型的学校教育都是免费的。技术专科学校和高等学校的全体学生每月都可以领到津贴。
    一九五四年政府拨给用于人民教育的款项比一九四七年增加了百分之七十，拨给用于校舍和保育院建筑的费用增加了百分之二百六十六。学生可以得到足够的教科书。仅最近几年内，就出版了六十九种教科书将近三百万册。
    一九五四年十一月举行的蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会通过了发展国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划。计划规定乡村的学龄儿童一律应受初级义务教育，大城市的儿童应受七年制的义务教育。在第二个五年计划时期内，准备新建二十八所小学、二十四所七年制学校、十二所十年制学校，到一九五七年末，普通教育学校的学生的数量将达到八万五千人。教师的质量在一年年地提高。受过高等专门教育的教师，一九五四年比一九四七年几乎增加了五倍。仅在一九五四—一九五五年这个学年年底，从国立大学教育系和师范学院就将有二百个具有高等文化水平的教师毕业。近年来，政府采取了许多提高教师水平的重要措施。在师范学校里为小学教师成立了函授班，在十年制学校里组织经常性的辅导，国立师范学院里为中学教师组织有业余进修。
    为了提高教师的水平，在暑假期间组织短期训练班，出版有定期刊物“教师”、教师参考材料及其他教学材料。介绍优秀的教师的工作经验和推广苏联教师的工作经验问题，受到了极大的重视。一九五三年开始的小学校和中学校的鉴定工作在一九五四年十二月结束。所有这些措施对于提高学校的教育工作质量发生了良好的影响。学生的课外和校外的工作是改进学校教育工作的重要环节之一。
    在学校里组织有文学小组、木工小组、技术小组、少年自然科学家小组、少年地理学家小组、数学小组等等。另外还有体育小组、歌舞小组、象棋和音乐小组。乡村学校的学生业余文娱小组在牧民中间的演出，获得了很大的成就。中学业余文娱小组成员中的优秀分子，曾参加了世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。例如，乌兰巴托市第二十年制学校七年级女学生玛基格苏伦就是联欢节的多次参加者。
    许多儿童阅览室设立起来。蒙古革命青年联盟和少先队的组织在学校的生活中占有重要的位置。在它们的倡议下，在学校领导者和家长委员会的支持之下，学校里经常举行晚会，组织同先进生产者、优秀的作家、演员、共和国功勋教员、人民革命的英雄老战士，一九三六——一九三九年和一九四五年在哈尔新河战斗的参加者的联欢。另外还经常举行物理晚会、化学晚会、生物学晚会、数学晚会，以及纪念节日和纪念伟大的科学、技术、文学方面的代表人物的晚会。
    摆在普通教育学校面前的任务是艰巨的，它们要根据鼓舞蒙古人民在社会主义建设中争取新的成就的蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会决议的精神，来进一步改进学校的教育工作。
    蒙古人民共和国的全体教师决心在苏联和各兄弟人民民主国家的教师的支持和帮助下胜利地完成这些任务。
