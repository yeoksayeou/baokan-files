Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: New York dispatch: According to a recent Taipei dispatch published in the "New York Times," the Chiang bandit troops in Taiwan have become a completely Americanized puppet army under American training.

This dispatch stated that the United States completed the reorganization of the Chiang bandit ground forces last year. The military organization of the Chiang bandit troops is now being "transformed by the United States into a modern fighting force that is in principle and organization faithfully modeled on the American style." At the same time, the number of American Military Assistance Advisory Group personnel is also being expanded. Some of the American equipment is being transferred to Jinmen and Mazu. The dispatch revealed that there are American liaison officers on these islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops, "providing advice on the activities of the Chiang bandit troops."

The dispatch also said that the United States not only wants the Chiang bandit troops to "complete full combat readiness" but also wants them to "absorb American military thinking."

Despite this, the United States lacks confidence in the Chiang bandit troops. The dispatch said that although the United States has spent a lot of time, money, equipment, and effort in rebuilding a defeated Chiang bandit army, "the ultimate fate of Taiwan will depend on the protection of the US naval and air forces." "This is the essence of Washington's strategic concept regarding the Taiwan war zone."

    蒋贼军成了完全美国化的奴才军
    新华社十三日讯  纽约消息：据最近“纽约时报”刊载的一篇台北航讯透露，在美国的训练下，台湾的蒋贼军已成为一支完全美国化的奴才军。
    这篇航讯说，美国在去年完成了对蒋贼军地面部队的改组工作。蒋贼军的军事编制现在正在由美国“改造成一支在原则上和组织上都忠实地以美国式样为蓝本的现代化的战斗力量”。同时，美国军事援助顾问团的人数也在扩充。美国装备中有一部分被转运到金门和马祖去。这篇航讯透露，在这些蒋贼军盘踞的岛屿都有美国联络军官，对蒋贼军的活动提供意见”。
    这篇航讯又说，美国不仅要蒋贼军“完成充分战斗准备”，并且要他们“吸收美国的军事思想”。
    尽管如此，美国对蒋贼军是缺乏信心的，这篇航讯说，虽然美国在重建一支被击溃的蒋贼军上已经花费了很多时间、金钱、设备和努力，但是“台湾的最后命运将系于美国海空军的保护”。“这就是华盛顿关于台湾战区的战略概念的实质。”
