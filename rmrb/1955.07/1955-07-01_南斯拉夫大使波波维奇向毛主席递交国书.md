　  Mr. Chairman, on the occasion of presenting this letter of credence, I would like to express, on behalf of the President and people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, our deep respect to you and the Chinese people, and sincerely wish the People's Republic of China further development and happiness.

The Yugoslav people attach great importance to the great efforts made by the Chinese people in developing their own country and realizing their legitimate rights, and sincerely admire the achievements they have made in realizing a happy future and safeguarding world peace.
　  Mr. Chairman, please allow me to express my belief that, based on the common aspirations of our two peoples, the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries has created favorable possibilities for strengthening the friendship between the two peoples and developing cultural, economic and other mutual relations.

This relationship is not only in the interest of the Yugoslav and Chinese people, but also a contribution to the defense of world peace.

　  The various nationalities of Yugoslavia have a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Chinese people express their heartfelt congratulations to the Yugoslav people for their efforts in striving for national independence and building a happy life. Recently, the talks between the Yugoslav government and the Soviet government and their results have made an important contribution to the cause of world peace and human progress.
　  Now that China and Yugoslavia have established diplomatic relations, our two countries share a common desire to develop friendly cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. I am deeply convinced that the strengthening of friendly relations between our two peoples and governments is not only in the interest of China and Yugoslavia, but also of great significance to promoting the cause of world peace and cooperation.
　  Mr. Ambassador, I extend a warm welcome to you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslaviato the People's Republic of China. In your work to develop friendly cooperation between China and Yugoslavia, you will receive the assistance and support of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.
