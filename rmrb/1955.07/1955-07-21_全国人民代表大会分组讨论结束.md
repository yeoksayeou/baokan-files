Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. The group discussions of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, the 1954 National Final Accounts and the 1955 National Budget, the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the Comprehensive Plan for Eradicating the Yellow River's Flood Disaster and Developing the Yellow River Water Conservancy, have basically concluded today.

    Today, the representatives' groups enthusiastically discussed the comprehensive plan for eradicating the Yellow River's flood disaster and developing the Yellow River water conservancy. Many representatives cited Chairman Mao Zedong's famous statement, "We are doing a most glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before," to illustrate the important historical significance of this great plan to eradicate and develop the Yellow River. They said that the ideal that the Chinese people have dreamed of for thousands of years, the so-called "When a sage appears, the Yellow River will be clear," can only be realized today, in the era of the people's regime led by the Chinese Communist Party. Many representatives particularly pointed out that our taming and developing the Yellow River is a great struggle to transform nature. After the development of the Yellow River, it will have extremely important significance for the development of industrial construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, and shipping in the Yellow River basin. It will no longer be a disaster, but will provide great contributions to the happiness of hundreds of millions of people. This plan vividly demonstrates the superiority of our country and social system, and once again shows the world the peaceful will of our people. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their full agreement with the comprehensive plan for eradicating the Yellow River's flood disaster and developing the Yellow River water conservancy, and expressed their willingness to resolutely implement the tasks put forward in this plan. The representatives believed that this is a major event related to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country should work together to struggle to realize this great plan to transform nature. The representatives expressed their gratitude to the Soviet Union for its great and selfless assistance to our country.

    The group discussions on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan began on the 7th and have been going on for twelve days. During these ten days or so, the representatives have carefully and repeatedly studied the documents and held enthusiastic discussions on various aspects of the Five-Year Plan. Many representatives pointed out excitedly in their speeches that only under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, after the Chinese people have won the great victory of the people's revolution and established a new China, and after the national economy has been restored, is it possible to implement such a great first Five-Year Plan for building a socialist society. The representatives believed that the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan are arduous and complex; however, we have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. As long as the people of the whole country work together, we have full confidence in realizing this great plan. The representatives generally believed that the First Five-Year Plan is an action program for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people of the whole country to strive to realize the general task of the country during the transition period. In the struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, all ethnic groups in the country have glorious responsibilities. After the National People's Congress approves this great plan, it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity among the people of the whole country in order to mobilize the people of the whole country to work diligently, overcome difficulties, work diligently and thriftily, increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to fully realize the First Five-Year Plan.

    Many representatives' groups today continued to discuss the 1954 National Final Accounts and the 1955 National Budget. In today's discussions, the representatives continued to emphasize that increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste are of great significance for realizing the 1955 National Budget, and believe that it is necessary to mobilize the people of the whole country to work together.

    In the representatives' groups that continued to discuss the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress today, the representatives all expressed their unanimous agreement with the report and warmly supported the correct measures taken by the Standing Committee to approve the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng.

    From tomorrow, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress will begin plenary discussions.
