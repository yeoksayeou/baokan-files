Xinhua News Agency, July 14th. The First Ministry of Machine Building, in the spirit of comprehensive economy, has formulated a plan to further reduce production costs. This year, on the basis of the original plan to reduce costs by 9.44% compared to 1954, a further reduction of about 1.7% is required.

    In the machine building system, material consumption used to account for 56% of product costs, with significant waste. In 1954, the utilization rate of metal materials in the processing of various factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building was only 45% to 55%, the scrap rate of cast iron reached 13.3%, and the scrap rate of cast steel reached 9.67%. Now, this ministry has formulated improvement measures based on the spirit of comprehensive economy, requiring enterprises to increase metal utilization rates by 3% to 5%, reduce the scrap rate of cast iron to 9.8%, and reduce the scrap rate of cast steel to 7.5%. In addition, the use of wood in locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing enterprises and other enterprises is also required to be reduced by 3% to 5%. Savings requirements have also been stipulated for the consumption of other auxiliary materials, fuel, and electricity. In order to prevent future waste of materials, the technical department of the First Ministry of Machine Building has begun to formulate management methods for material consumption quotas, and the supply department will establish a quota-based material distribution system in some enterprises and gradually promote it in order to control the use of materials.

    The expenses required for enterprise management by the First Ministry of Machine Building account for 18.6% of production costs, and there is great potential for savings in this area. For example, the monthly office expenses for each technical and management personnel in the enterprises under the Second Machine Industry Bureau of this ministry are 5.8 yuan, while those under the First Machine Industry Bureau are more than 9 yuan, indicating significant savings potential. The First Ministry of Machine Building has, in response to this situation, decided to reduce enterprise management expenses by 10% to 15% from the original plan, and is preparing to have each professional bureau formulate quota standards for enterprise management expenses to prevent waste.

    The First Ministry of Machine Building will also reduce production costs by increasing labor productivity, and by streamlining non-production personnel and excessive management personnel in conjunction with enterprise reorganization in the second half of this year, reducing factory management expenses and non-production expenditures. The streamlined personnel will be transferred to study or support new factories.

    第一机械工业部根据全面节约的精神
    订出进一步降低生产成本的计划
    新华社十四日讯  第一机械工业部根据全面节约精神，订出进一步降低生产成本的计划，今年要求在原计划成本比一九五四年降低百分之九点四四的基础上，再降低百分之一点七左右。
    机械工业系统的材料消耗，过去占产品成本百分之五十六，其中有很大浪费，一九五四年第一机械工业部各工厂金属材料加工过程中的利用率只占百分之四十五到五十五，铸铁废品率达百分之十三点三，铸钢废品率达百分之九点六七。现在，这个部已经根据全面节约精神订出了改进的措施，要求各企业在金属利用率方面提高百分之三到五，铸铁废品率降低到百分之九点八，铸钢废品率降低到百分之七点五。另外在机车车辆制造企业和其它企业中对木材的使用，也要求节约百分之三到五。其它辅助材料、燃料、电力的消耗，也都规定了节约的要求。为了防止今后浪费材料，第一机械工业部的技术部门已着手制定材料消耗定额管理办法，由供应部门在一些企业中建立限额发料制度，并逐步推行，以此来控制材料的使用。
    第一机械工业部企业管理所需的费用占生产成本费的百分之十八点六，在这方面也可以大大节约。例如这个部的第二机器工业管理局所属企业每月每个技术人员和管理人员所耗用的办公费是五元八角，而第一机器工业管理局所属企业却要九元多，存在很大的节约潜力。第一机械工业部已经针对这种情况，决定从原计划的企业管理费用中压缩百分之十到十五，并准备由各专业局制定企业管理费用限额标准，防止浪费。
    第一机械工业部还要从提高劳动生产率，以及在今年下半年结合企业整编，精简非生产人员和过多的管理人员，减少工厂管理费用和非生产开支等方面，来降低生产成本。精简的人员将调去学习或支援新厂。
