    The People's Hope
    By Our Reporter Lu Hao
    Socialist industrialization is the unanimous hope of the nation's 600 million people. Industrialization will give us large amounts of steel, enabling us to manufacture more ships, tractors, and airplanes. Industrialization will provide us with more coal, allowing our chimneys to smoke, boilers to burn, and every family to have more light and heat. Industrialization will give us tremendous electric power, enabling us to harness rivers and provide greater power to factories and mines. Industrialization will provide us with more machinery and equipment, making people's labor more efficient. Industrialization will make our motherland prosperous, strong, and happy. Industrialization is so important, but our past industry has always been poor and backward.
    Is it that our people do not want industrialization? Is it that our people do not understand the benefits of industrialization? Of course not. In old China, industrialization was like a beautiful, dreamlike soap bubble; those engaged in industry only experienced distress and sighed.
    The situation is now completely different. The announcement of the great First Five-Year Plan has shown everyone a broad path forward.
    National People's Congress representative Shao Xianghua, although he started working with steel twenty-three years ago, only found true fulfillment in his work in New China. Shao Xianghua studied steelmaking in England and Germany, but after returning to China, he could only work in a machinery factory in Kunming. In 1941, Shao Xianghua was overjoyed to be assigned to the Qi Jiang Electrometallurgical Plant in Sichuan to build a fifteen-ton open-hearth furnace. At that time, the Burma Road was busy transporting American lipsticks and stockings from the Hwa Hwa Company, established by H. H. Kung, but the steel and refractory bricks needed for this open-hearth furnace could not be transported. It took more than three years for the open-hearth furnace to finally produce steel; but the small amount of steel produced by the small open-hearth furnace could not find a market in China at that time. After producing several dozen heats of steel, the factory had to close down.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Shao Xianghua went to Anshan. After more than a year, Anshan barely managed to restore production of one open-hearth furnace, but after smelting ninety-odd heats of steel, this only open-hearth furnace also ceased production.
    Shao Xianghua spent his ten years in this way, until the Chinese people liberated Anshan, and Shao Xianghua was able to devote all his talents to his motherland. In previous years, Shao Xianghua was the deputy director of the steelmaking plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He and the entire staff of the plant accepted the suggestions of Soviet experts and changed the "cold rammed bottom" method to the "sintering" method, increasing the furnace capacity by 50 percent. Soviet experts also helped them transform the pre-smelting furnaces, which accounted for one-third of the number of furnaces in the plant, which greatly improved steelmaking capacity. Currently, the steel production of the steelmaking plant has exceeded its original design capacity by one time, with one plant producing the steel of two plants. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex is rebuilt and completed, it will produce 3.22 million tons of steel. Comparing this to the national steel production of only 158,000 tons in 1949, the year the People's Republic of China was founded, Shao Xianghua said, "My personal experience has made me completely believe in the beautiful prospects of the motherland's socialist industrialization."
    The experience of National People's Congress representative Fei Guangtai is similar to the experiences of thousands of engineers and technicians in old China. He began working in the A Jin Gou coal mine in Fushun, which produced 100 tons of raw coal per day, in 1930. After the "September 18th Incident," Chinese engineers and technicians were all dismissed. Fei Guangtai, who had graduated from the Department of Mining and Metallurgy of Northeastern University, had to teach at the Third Municipal Primary School in Fengtian at this time. This teaching career lasted for four years, until 1937, when he found a job in the Da Wan Gou coal mine in Hailong County. It was an ancient and backward coal mine where coal was mined by hand, carried on backs, and the roadways were only three or four feet wide. The entire mine could only produce fifteen tons of coal per day. But even this small, dilapidated coal mine was later closed down, and Fei Guangtai had to become unemployed.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Fei Guangtai got a job at the Fushun Mining Bureau with the help of an old classmate. However, in November 1946, Fei Guangtai contracted typhoid fever, and the Fushun Mining Bureau immediately fired him. For nearly a year, Fei Guangtai had to sell his clothes to support his family. After the liberation of Fushun, he became the deputy director of the Long Feng mine in Fushun. The equipment of the Long Feng mine could produce several thousand tons of raw coal per day; however, before liberation, the daily output of the Long Feng mine had fallen to only 3 percent of the equipment's potential, and sometimes the mine did not produce any coal at all. Even the coal for heating had to be borrowed by the workers from the Laohutai coal mine. Fei Guangtai knew that to produce more coal, he had to find a way to drain the gas underground. In 1949, he made preliminary experiments, and in 1952, his experiments were successful. Originally, gas was a hazard to coal mining, but now it has become an indispensable raw material for the manufacture of carbon black in the rubber industry. Now, the daily coal production of the entire Long Feng mine has reached more than forty times that before liberation, and at its peak, it has reached more than fifty times. Not only has the output been greatly increased, but the gas accidents in the mine have also been basically eliminated. Everything in the mine has been gasified, and the residences, canteens, hospitals, and nurseries all use gas. Here, workers also use gas to heat their kangs to keep warm.
    This is only the first step taken by the Fushun coal mine. The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the annual output of the Fushun Mining Bureau is 9.3 million tons. As the chief engineer of the Fushun Mining Bureau, what a huge and glorious responsibility is before Fei Guangtai!
    The increase in power generation capacity during the First Five-Year Plan is 2.05 million kilowatts. Those familiar with the power industry know how huge this number is. National People's Congress representative Mao Henian told me that when he graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of the former Peiping University in 1933, China's thermal power generation capacity was only about 600,000 to 700,000 kilowatts, and this power was mainly concentrated in a few large cities, and its equipment was controlled by foreign capitalists. More than twenty of his classmates majored in electrical engineering, but after graduation, some went to the railway to manage materials; others could not even find a position as a middle school teacher. Mao Henian returned from studying abroad in 1939 and worked in a wire factory in Kunming. Raw materials had to rely on foreign countries, and the finished products produced could not find a market. Now, Mao Henian is the chief engineer of the Design Administration of the Electric Power Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The First Five-Year Plan is causing tremendous changes in his department. In old China, no one in the electric power sector knew how to design, nor did anyone engage in design work. All of this was monopolized by foreign capitalists in the past. Now, the strength of his design department can simultaneously carry out the design of one or two hundred engineering projects. Before 1952, our electric power design department only collected some design data or did some very simple restoration design work; but not long ago, a 25,000-kilowatt power plant has been expanded and completed. With the help of Soviet experts, the Northeast Electric Power Design Department designed for the first time a 370-kilometer-long 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line.
    The situation of hydropower generation in old China was also pitifully small. National People's Congress representative Yu Kaiquan told me that more than ten years ago, a hydropower station of less than 1,000 kilowatts had been built on Dianchi Lake in Yunnan; the hydropower station on the Longxi River in Sichuan had not been completed for a long time. Yu Kaiquan once worked in Fengman. The Japanese invaders established this hydropower station to plunder China's resources. He knew that more than 3,500 Chinese workers died there, so people said that the Fengman dam was built with the flesh and blood of the workers. However, Yu Kaiquan, who specialized in hydropower generation, had to go to the railway to engage in electricity in 1947, and he did not get the opportunity to return to Fengman until after liberation. Now, the Fengman Hydropower Station has been basically completed. According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, the power generation capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Station can reach more than 560,000 kilowatts after the entire reconstruction is completed. Many employees who participated in the construction of the Fengman Hydropower Station are now distributed at the construction sites of hydropower stations such as Guanting and Shizitan. When they parted, they all said that they would meet at the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River in the future. This day is certainly getting closer and closer. Yu Kaiquan is now the deputy chief engineer of the Survey and Design Bureau of the Hydropower Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. As early as 1952, he had been to Sanmenxia. The plan for the great project of building the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River in the First Five-Year Plan has been placed before him and his colleagues.
    The prospects for the development of the machinery industry in the First Five-Year Plan have encouraged many people who have long been engaged in the machinery industry. National People's Congress representative Lei Tianjue is one of them. The total number of machine tools produced by our machine manufacturing industry in the two years after the completion of the construction of the First Five-Year Plan is almost equal to the total number of machine tools in the country before liberation. The foundation of the machinery industry in old China was very pitiful. For example, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory was an agricultural machinery factory of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital before liberation. In name, it was an agricultural machinery factory, but in reality, it made hoes or assembled some cotton gins. It had never made any machines at all. Now, it is a factory that can manufacture fifteen kinds of precision grinders. The grinder is one of the most precise machines in general machines. The machines produced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have been highly praised at the Leipzig Fair and other fairs.
    The First Five-Year Plan also painted a beautiful prospect for our electrical appliance industry. When National People's Congress representative Chu Yinghuang graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1931, the electrical appliance industry in China could only make light bulbs, electric fans, small transformers, or make small accessories for foreign power equipment. By 1936, our country was able to manufacture AC induction motors from one horsepower to one hundred horsepower, and the main raw materials for these motors were of course foreign. Until before liberation, the development of China's electrical appliance industry was as slow as a snail crawling. The largest self-made generator could only make 200 kilowatts, and its capacity could only supply 5,000 forty-watt light bulbs; but now we can make 10,000-kilowatt hydropower generators ourselves. Such generators will be installed in the famous Guanting Reservoir, which can supply 250,000 forty-watt light bulbs for lighting. The Soviet Union is helping us build with the world's most advanced complete sets of technology and equipment, which has brought our electrical appliance industry into an unprecedented situation. Before liberation, we could only make part of the equipment for power grids below 10,000 volts. Now we can produce complete sets of equipment for 110,000-volt power grids; in the past, we could not make underground cables for urban factories and mines ourselves, but now we can make 10,000-volt cables ourselves. Chu Yinghuang had never thought of all this in the past. The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the factories manufacturing power generation equipment that will begin construction within five years will be able to manufacture power generation equipment with a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts, 25,000 kilowatts, and even 50,000 kilowatts per unit after they are all built. Compared with the 200-kilowatt generators that our country could only manufacture with foreign materials before liberation, Chu Yinghuang was completely attracted by the great First Five-Year Plan of the motherland.
    The great First Five-Year Plan will lay a solid foundation for the socialist industrialization of the motherland. People, for the industrialization of the motherland, for your own happiness and the happiness of your children and grandchildren, dedicate all your talents to the socialist construction of the motherland. This is the people's hope.

    人民的希望
    本报记者　陆灏
    社会主义工业化是全国六亿人民一致的希望。工业化会给我们大量的钢铁，它能使我们制造更多的轮船、拖拉机和飞机；工业化会使我们得到更多的煤，它能使我们的烟囱冒烟，锅炉燃烧，每一个家庭有更多的光和热；工业化会使我们得到巨大的电力，它能让江河为我们利用，工厂和矿山得到更大的动力；工业化会给我们更多的机械设备，人民的劳动就能变得更有效。工业化会使我们的祖国繁荣、富强和幸福。工业化是这样重要，但我们过去的工业却一直是贫穷和落后。
    是我们的人民不想工业化吗？是我们的人民不懂得工业化的好处吗？当然不是。在旧中国，工业化好像美丽的梦幻般的肥皂泡沫一样；搞工业的人，只有苦闷和叹息。
    现在的情形已经完全不同了。伟大的第一个五年计划的宣布更给每一个人展示了宽阔的道路。
    全国人民代表大会代表邵象华，虽然在二十三年以前就开始和钢铁打交道，但真正的工作却在新中国才得到。邵象华在英国和德国学过炼钢，但他回国后只好在昆明的一个机器厂里工作。到了一九四一年，邵象华欢天喜地被派到四川綦江的电化冶炼厂办一座十五吨的平炉。当时滇缅公路上可以忙碌地运输孔祥熙开办的华华公司的美国口红和丝袜，但这座平炉所需要的钢材和耐火砖却无法运来。足足花了三年多的时间，平炉才算正式出钢；但小小的平炉所出的一点点钢，在那时候的中国，却还找不到销路，出了几十炉钢，这个厂就只好关门停工了。
    抗日战争胜利以后，邵象华到了鞍山，经过了一年多的时间，鞍山才勉勉强强地恢复了一座平炉的生产，但炼了九十几炉钢以后，这唯一的平炉也停止生产了。
    邵象华就是这样度过了他的十几年，直到中国人民解放了鞍山，邵象华才有可能把自己全部的才能供献给自己的祖国。前几年，邵象华是鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂的副厂长，他和这个厂的全体职工接受了苏联专家的建议，把“冷打炉底”的办法改成“烧结”的办法，使炉子的容量增加了百分之五十。苏联专家还帮助他们把厂里占炉子数目三分之一的预炼炉加以改造，这使炼钢能力又大为提高。目前炼钢厂的钢产量已经超过了它的原设计能力一倍，一个厂子生产着两个厂子的钢。到鞍山钢铁联合企业在改建完成以后将要生产三百二十二万吨钢，对比了一九四九年中华人民共和国成立这一年全国钢产量只有十五万八千多吨的数字，邵象华说：“我自己切身的经历，已经使我完全相信祖国社会主义工业化的美丽远景了。”
    全国人民代表大会代表费广泰的经历，也和旧中国千百个工程技术人员的遭遇一样。他一九三○年开始在抚顺日产一百吨原煤的阿金沟煤矿工作。“九一八”事变以后，中国的工程技术人员都被解雇，曾经在东北大学采冶系毕业的费广泰，这时候只好到当时的奉天市立第三小学校去教书。教书的生涯一直过了四年，到了一九三七年，他才在海龙县大湾沟煤矿找到了职业。那是一座用手刨煤，用背背煤，巷道只有三四尺宽的古老而落后的煤矿，整个矿一天只能出十五吨煤。但就是这样小的破烂的煤矿，以后也停闭了，费广泰只好跟着失业。
    抗日战争胜利以后，费广泰靠了老同学的帮忙，到了抚顺矿务局工作，但在一九四六年的十一月，费广泰得了伤寒病，抚顺矿务局马上开除了他，有将近一年的日子，费广泰只好变卖自己的衣物维持全家的生活。抚顺解放以后，他在抚顺龙凤矿当副矿长。龙凤矿的设备可以日产数千吨原煤；但解放以前的龙凤矿每天的产量却低落到只有设备应产量的百分之三，有时矿上根本不出煤，连烧暖气用的煤也要让工人们到老虎台煤矿去借。费广泰知道要多出煤，就要想办法把地下的瓦斯排出来，一九四九年作了初步试验，一九五二年他的试验宣告成功，本来瓦斯是采煤的祸害，现在成为橡胶工业不可缺少的炭黑制造原料。现在龙凤全矿煤的日产量已经达到解放前的四十多倍，最高的时候达到五十多倍。不但是产量大为提高，而且坑内瓦斯事故也基本消灭了，矿上一切都煤气化了，住宅、食堂、医院、托儿所都用上了煤气。在这里，工人还用煤气烧炕取得温暖。
    这仅仅是抚顺煤矿走的第一步。第一个五年计划规定抚顺矿务局的年产量是九百三十万吨，作为抚顺矿务局总工程师的费广泰，在他的面前是多么巨大多么光荣的责任啊！
    第一个五年计划期内增加的发电能力为二百零五万瓩。熟悉电力工业的人都知道，这是一个多么巨大的数字。全国人民代表大会代表毛鹤年告诉我，他在一九三三年原北平大学电机工程系毕业的时候，中国的火电发电能力只有六七十万瓩左右，而这些电力主要是集中在几个大城市，其设备又操纵在外国资本家的手里。和他同班学电机的有二十多人，但在毕业以后，有的则去铁路上管理材料；有的连中学教员的职位也找不到。毛鹤年一九三九年从外国留学回来，在昆明的一家电线厂里工作，原料要依靠外国，而制造出来的成品却找不到销路。现在，毛鹤年是燃料工业部电业管理总局设计管理局的总工程师，第一个五年计划使他所在的部门正在发生巨大的变化。在旧中国，电业部门根本没有人懂得设计，也没有人从事设计工作，这一切过去都是外国资本家包办的，现在他所在的设计部门的力量已经同时能进行一、二百个工程项目的设计。在一九五二年以前，我们的电业设计部门还只是搜集一些设计资料或者做一些极简单的恢复设计工作；但就在不久之前，二万五千瓩容量的发电厂已经扩建完成。东北电业设计部门在苏联专家的帮助下，第一次设计了一条三百七十公里长的二十二万伏超高压送电线。
    旧中国水力发电的情形也少得可怜。全国人民代表大会代表于开泉告诉我，还是在十几年以前，云南的滇池上曾修建过一座不到一千瓩的水力发电站；四川龙溪河上的水电站却长期没有完工。于开泉曾经在丰满工作，日本侵略者为了掠夺中国的资源而建立这个水电站，他知道有三千五百多中国工人死亡在那里，所以人们说丰满的拦河坝是用工人们的血肉堆砌起来的。但专学水力发电的于开泉在一九四七年却不得不到铁路上去搞电力，直到解放以后他才获得机会回到丰满。现在丰满水电站已经基本上竣工，按照第一个五年计划的规定，丰满水电站在全部改建完成以后，发电能力可以达到五十六万瓩以上。曾经参加建设丰满水电站的很多职工现在已经分布在官厅、狮子滩等处的水电站建设工地，他们在分别的时候都说将来要在黄河的三门峡水电站会师，这个日子现在当然是越来越近了。于开泉现在是燃料工业部水电总局勘察设计局的副总工程师，早在一九五二年，他曾去过三门峡，第一个五年计划中关于兴建黄河三门峡水电站伟大工程的计划，已经摆在他和他的同事们的面前了。
    第一个五年计划关于机械工业发展的远景，鼓舞了很多长期从事机械工业的人，全国人民代表大会代表雷天觉就是其中的一个。我们的机器制造业在完成第一个五年计划建设后的两年里，工具机生产的总数就几乎等于解放前全国工具机的总数。旧中国的机械工业的基础是很可怜的，比如上海机床厂，解放以前是国民党官僚资本的一个农业机器厂，名义上是农业机器厂，实际上是造些锄头或拼凑一些轧花机，根本没有造过什么机器，而现在却是一座能够制造十五种精密磨床的工厂了。磨床是一般机器中比较最精密的一种。上海机床厂生产的机器，在莱比锡和其它博览会上都得到很高的评价。
    第一个五年计划也为我们的电器工业描绘了美丽的远景。全国人民代表大会代表褚应璜一九三一年毕业于上海交通大学电机系的时候，当时中国的电器工业只能做些电灯泡、电风扇、小变压器，或者是为国外来的动力设备做些小的配件。到了一九三六年，我国才能够自己制造从一马力到一百马力的交流感应电动机，而这些电机的主要原材料当然都是外国的。直到解放以前，中国电器工业的发展还慢得像蜗牛爬行，自制的发电机最大还只能做二百瓩的，它的能力只能供给五千盏四十瓦的电灯；而现在我们就可以自制一万瓩的水力发电机了，这样的发电机将安装在著名的官厅水库，它可以供给二十五万盏四十瓦的电灯照明。苏联以世界上最先进的成套的技术设备帮助我们建设，这就使我们的电器工业进入到从来没有过的境地。解放以前我们只能做一万伏以下的电力网的一部分设备，现在我们可以生产十一万伏电力网的成套设备；过去城市厂矿用的地下电缆自己不会做，而现在我们已经能够自己制造一万伏的电缆了。这一切，褚应璜过去是想也没有想到过的。第一个五年计划规定，在五年内开始建设的制造发电设备的工厂，在它们全部建设完成后，我国就能够制造每台容量一万二千瓩、二万五千瓩以至五万瓩的发电设备，这和解放以前我国只能用外国材料制造二百瓩的发电机相比，褚应璜就完全为祖国伟大的第一个五年计划所吸引了。
    伟大的第一个五年计划将为祖国社会主义的工业化奠定可靠的基础。人们，为了祖国的工业化，为了你自己和你子孙后代的幸福，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中，献出你的全部的才能，这是人民的希望。
