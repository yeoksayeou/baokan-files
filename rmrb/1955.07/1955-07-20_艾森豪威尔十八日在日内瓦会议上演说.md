Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 19th. U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech at the Four-Power Summit in Geneva on the 18th. He began by pointing out that the purpose of the four heads of government gathering in Geneva is to find a basis for reconciliation, which would allow the people of the four countries and elsewhere to live safer and happier lives. The four heads of government came to Geneva also in response to a universal and urgent demand, that the political leaders of the major powers find a path to peace.

Eisenhower said that one cannot expect to solve all the world's problems that need to be solved in a few days. Many of these problems are deeply rooted in war, conflict, and history. He said that these problems are made even more difficult by differences in the ideologies and aspirations of governments.

He went on to say that perhaps we can establish a new spirit, so that those problems within our scope of responsibility may be resolved in the future. These problems of concern to us are not fundamentally unsolvable. In an atmosphere of fear, suspicion, and even hostility, these problems seem insurmountable, but if these conditions can be changed, then great achievements can be made. In this case, our foreign ministers will be able to continue our work at a later stage, by themselves or together with others, to find solutions to our problems.

Eisenhower said that there is no doubt that there are some philosophical beliefs among our countries that are irreconcilable in many ways. However, it is not always necessary for people to have the same thoughts and beliefs in order to cooperate. The important point is that no one should try to impose his beliefs by force or deceit, thereby forcing unwilling people to accept his system.

Eisenhower then spoke about the specific issues that cause tension between countries and the solutions he advocated.

He said that the first is the issue of the reunification of Germany and the establishment of an all-German government on the basis of free elections. The divided state of Germany is a fundamental source of instability in Europe. If we continue to perpetuate situations that endanger peace while we talk about peace, then such talk is of little significance. The German question should remain a central topic of this conference.

He said that our solution should take into account the legitimate security interests of all parties concerned. He expressed his insistence that a unified Germany should have the right to make its own choices, the right to exercise its inherent right of "collective self-defense," while also expressing his willingness to consider the legitimate security interests of the Soviet Union. He said that the Paris Accords contain many provisions that meet this purpose. However, we are very willing to further consider reasonable, practical, and mutually guaranteed measures that are in line with the security of all parties concerned.

Eisenhower then raised the so-called issue of Eastern European countries, and he insisted that this is a matter of respecting and restoring the right of the people of all countries to choose their own form of government.

Speaking of the obstacles to the exchange and contact of people from various countries, Eisenhower said: "The American people want to be friends with the Soviet people. There is no inherent division between our people or countries. There is no territorial conflict or commercial competition. Historically, our two countries have always been at peace with each other. However, friendly understanding between people is not easy to develop when there are artificial barriers, such as the current interference with exchanges. The time has come to begin to put down all the curtains, whether made of guns, laws, or regulations. But this can only be done in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust."

Eisenhower also raised the so-called issue of "international communism," and described it as a cause of distrust and a hindrance to the relations between other countries and the Soviet Union.

Eisenhower then spoke about the issue of armaments. He said that this is both a result of the current tension and distrust and a cause of this tension and distrust. Contrary to a fundamental goal of the United Nations Charter, armaments now divert a large part of humanity's efforts from creative uses to unproductive uses. He believes that the best way to solve the problem of limiting armaments is to seek—as a first step—reliable means of monitoring and inspecting military forces, so that terrible accidents are impossible, regardless of whether the method taken is a sudden attack or the secret sabotage of agreed restrictions. In this regard, nothing is more important than exploring together the central issue of effective common inspection, which is a test. Such a system is the basis of genuine disarmament. He also believes that reducing armaments will and should guarantee that a portion of the money saved will flow into the less developed regions of the world to help their economic development.

Eisenhower also spoke about the peaceful use of atomic energy, and in this regard, he expressed his hope that the Soviet Union would participate in the "Atomic Pool" plan proposed by the United States in December 1953.

Eisenhower concluded his speech by saying that in this first speech, he had very simply stated some of the issues to be addressed by the conference. He said, "I hope that as our work progresses here, we will all make suggestions as to how we can promote the process of seeking solutions to these problems. It might be good if each of us took turns to state our country's views in the same way. Then, we can quickly see the range of issues that may be beneficial to discuss here, and thus arrange our time."

### 艾森豪威尔十八日在日内瓦会议上演说

    艾森豪威尔十八日在日内瓦会议上演说
    新华社日内瓦十九日电　美国总统艾森豪威尔十八日在四国政府首脑会议上发表演说。他首先指出，四大国首脑在日内瓦聚会的目的是要寻找一个和解的基础，这种和解将使四国人民以及其他地方人民的生活可以安全而更为幸福。四国首脑到日内瓦来也是为了响应一个普遍的迫切的要求，这就是大国的政治领袖们要找出一条通向和平的道路。
    艾森豪威尔说，不能指望在几天的时间中解决全世界需要解决的所有问题。这些问题中有许多问题的根源是深深地埋在战争、冲突和历史中的。他说，由于政府的意识形态和抱负的分歧，这些问题就更为困难。
    他接着说，可是，也许我们能建立一种新的精神，使得那些在我们责任范围之内的问题在将来可能得到解决。对我们利害有关的这些问题，并不是根本无法解决的。在恐惧、猜疑和甚至敌意的情况下，这些问题看起来是无法解决的，如果这些情况能予以改变，那末就能有很大的成就。在这种情形下，我们的外长在以后的阶段将能够继续进行我们的工作，由他们自己或同别人一道，找出我们问题的解决办法。
    艾森豪威尔说，毫无疑问，在我们国家之间，有些哲学信仰在许多方面是无法加以调和的。但是，并不总是一定要人们的思想和信仰一样，然后才能合作。重要的一点是：任何人都不应试图以武力或诡计来推行他的信仰，从而强使不愿意接受的人接受他的制度。
    艾森豪威尔接着谈到造成各国间紧张局势的具体问题和他所主张的解决这些问题的方法。
    他说，第一是统一德国和在自由选举的基础上成立全德政府的问题。德国的分裂状态是欧洲不稳定的一个基本的根源。如果在我们谈论和平的同时我们还使危害和平的情况持续下去，那末这种谈论，就没有多大意义。德国问题仍然应当是我们这个会议的一个中心题目。
    他说，我们的解决办法应当考虑一切有关方面的正当的安全利益。他表示坚持统一的德国应当有权作它的抉择，有权行使它固有的“集体自卫”的权利，同时也表示准备考虑苏联的正当的安全利益。他说，巴黎协定包含许多符合这个目的的条款。但是，我们很愿意进一步考虑合理的、切实可行的、符合于所有有关方面的安全的相互保障办法。
    艾森豪威尔接着提出了所谓东欧国家问题，他硬说这是尊重和恢复各国人民选择他们自己的政府的形式的权利的问题。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到各国人民交往和接触的障碍问题时说：“美国人民希望同苏联人民成为朋友。我们的人民或国家之间并没有什么天生的分歧。也没有领土上的冲突或商业上的竞争。在历史上说来，我们两国一直是和平相处的。但是，人民之间的友好的了解在存在着人为障碍的时候，就不容易发展，这种障碍像目前的干涉来往就是。现在是应该开始把一切不论是枪炮、法律或是条例布成的幕放下的时候了。但是，只有在互相尊重和信任的气氛中才能够做到这一点。”
    艾森豪威尔还提出所谓“国际共产主义”问题，并且把它说成是妨害其他国家同苏联之间的关系和造成不信任的原因。
    艾森豪威尔接着谈到军备问题。他说，这既是目前存在的紧张局势和不信任的结果，又是造成这种紧张局势和不信任的原因。同联合国宪章的一个基本目标相反，军备现在把人类的一大部分努力从创造性的用途分散到非生产性的用途。他认为：解决限制军备问题的最好办法是寻求——作为第一步——监督和视察军事力量的可靠办法，使得可怖的意外事件不可能发生，不管所采取的方式是突然的袭击还是暗地破坏商定的限制。在这方面，最重要的莫过于我们在一起探讨有效的共同视察这个带有考验性的中心问题。这样的制度是真正的裁军基础。他还认为，裁减军备将会而且应当能够保证省下的一部分钱流入世界上较落后的地区，以帮助它们的经济发展。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到和平利用原子能问题，在这方面，他表示希望苏联参加美国在一九五三年十二月提出的“原子共同储备”计划。
    艾森豪威尔在结束他的演说时说：他在这个第一篇发言中，已经非常简单地说明了应由会议加以解决的问题中的某些问题。他说，“我希望，随着我们在这里的工作的进行，我们大家将提出建议，说明我们可以怎样来促进寻求解决这些问题的过程。如果我们每一个人都同样地轮流表明自己国家的意见，那也许是很好的。然后，我们就可以很快地看看在这里加以讨论可能有好处的问题的范围，并从而安排我们的时间。”
