Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th - Construction of the first large iron bridge across the Yangtze River has officially commenced ahead of schedule.

	Looking out from Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang, material trains heading south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, after crossing the Han River railway bridge, continuously arrive at the bridge construction site. On the river surface between Wuchang and Hanyang, crane ships, floating power stations, and iron barges and sailboats loaded with construction machinery and materials are densely arranged. Lifting machinery raises long arms into the air, and dedicated transport steamers shuttle rapidly between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, creating a magnificent scene of waterborne construction. Engineers, technicians, railway soldiers, and demobilized soldiers participating in the bridge construction have gathered here from all over the country to undertake arduous and complex work to conquer the natural barrier of the Yangtze River. Renowned Soviet bridge experts travel back and forth on the river by speedboat every day to guide the work.

	The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge adopts the world's newest construction methods. After the successful testing of this construction method, part of the foundation engineering of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has begun construction. Before the arrival of the Yangtze River flood season, the bridge construction workers had completed the sinking of the caissons for the first and second bridge piers near the Hanyang bank and completed the first step of sinking the steel cofferdam for the eighth bridge pier. Now, the workers are persevering in drilling work on top of the caisson group of the first bridge pier, braving the high water level of the Yangtze River. The foundation engineering of the approach bridge on the Hanyang bank and the Yuehu Street overpass has also started successively.

	The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will be a double-layered railway and highway bridge. The upper layer is a wide highway where multiple large vehicles can drive side by side, with sidewalks. The lower layer is a double-track railway for trains to travel back and forth. Under the bridge, huge ships can pass unhindered all year round. After the completion of this Yangtze River Bridge, together with its components—the Han River railway bridge and the Han River highway bridge—it will connect the two major railway trunk lines running north-south in our country, the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, and the highway network north and south of the Yangtze River. The three towns of Wuhan will also be united as one.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th - A world's newest bridge construction method, the "Caisson Drilling Method," has been successfully tested on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site. After the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge adopted this new construction method, the start date has been brought forward from the original fourth quarter to July. The overall construction progress of the bridge will also be accelerated, and it is expected that the entire project can be completed ahead of schedule as a result.

	The greatest advantage of this new construction method is that it replaces the traditional underwater construction method in modern bridge construction with above-water construction of the bridge pier foundation. Therefore, even in deep water and rapid currents, it is not restricted by dry seasons, flood seasons, and water level fluctuations, and construction can be carried out almost all year round. For nearly a hundred years, the world's bridge engineering community has considered the "pneumatic caisson method" to be the most scientific method for building bridge piers in deep-water rivers. However, this construction method can only be carried out underwater during the dry season. If it is used in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, the actual construction time each year would be only about three months. Moreover, the geological conditions of the Yangtze River channel are complex, and it is very difficult for workers to enter the caisson at the bottom of the river to work, which can easily lead to danger. The new construction method avoids these shortcomings, requiring only sinking caissons, drilling, sealing the bottom, and pouring underwater concrete on the river surface to build the bridge pier from the riverbed upwards. In terms of engineering costs, the new construction method can also save approximately 10% of the cost of machinery and equipment compared to the "pneumatic caisson method."

	This new construction method was successfully tested by accepting the suggestions of the Soviet expert working group of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau. Bridge builders and Soviet experts worked together to carry out four months of arduous and complex testing work on the Yangtze River, starting in February this year. They jointly created a huge reinforced concrete caisson and other new machinery, and repeatedly carried out tests on a test pier on the riverbank, persevering even in wind and rain.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th - Before the official commencement of construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, thousands of bridge-building workers had carried out arduous and extensive preparatory work.

	The geological survey work for the bridge began in 1950. From last year to this year, hundreds of geological drilling personnel have thoroughly investigated the geological and hydrological conditions of the bridge site. During these years, they surveyed a total of eight comparison lines before finally selecting the bridge site. The Han River railway bridge and the railway connecting lines between Hankou and Hanyang, which were important preparatory steps for the bridge project, had already been completed last winter and this spring. The bridge piers of the Han River highway bridge have also been completed and are waiting to be erected with steel beams. Not long ago, the builders of the Yangtze River Bridge studied and tested a new construction plan for the bridge foundation engineering, which allowed the bridge project to start ahead of schedule. During the entire preparatory work period, a large number of construction forces were also trained and developed for the bridge construction.

    武汉长江大桥提前开始施工
    世界上最新的桥梁施工法在工地试验成功
    新华社武汉二十日电　横跨长江的第一座大铁桥工程，已按预定日期提前正式开始施工。
    登上汉阳的龟山四望，沿京汉铁路南下的材料列车，跨过汉水铁桥后，向着大桥工地源源而来。在武昌和汉阳之间的江面上，起重船、水上动力站以及满载施工机具、材料的铁驳船和帆船布列成群；起重机械向空中高举长臂，一艘艘专用运输汽轮在长江—汉水间穿梭疾驶，构成了水上施工的壮丽图景。参加建桥的工程师、技术工人、铁道兵和转业建设的军人，已从全国各地汇集在这里，为征服长江天堑展开了艰巨复杂的劳动；著名的苏联桥梁专家们，每天乘着快艇往返江上指导工作。
    武汉长江大桥采用了世界上最新式的施工方法，当这种施工方法试验成功以后，武汉长江大桥的基础工程有部分开始施工，建桥工人们在长江洪水季节到来之前，已把靠近汉阳岸边的第一号和二号桥墩的管柱下沉完毕，并完成了第八号桥墩钢围囹第一步下沉工作。现在，工人们正冒着长江的高水位，在一号桥墩的管柱群顶上坚持钻孔工作。汉阳岸的引桥和月湖街跨线桥的基础工程也先后开始了。
    武汉长江大桥将是一座双层的铁路和公路两用桥，上层为宽阔的公路，可以并列行驶多辆大型汽车，并有人行道；下层为双轨铁路，可以往来火车。桥下，巨大的轮船可以终年通行无阻。这座长江大桥建成以后，和它的组成部分——汉水铁桥和汉水公路桥一起，将使纵贯我国南北的京汉、粤汉两大铁路干线和长江南北的公路网在这里连接起来。武汉三镇也将连而为一。
    新华社武汉二十日电　一种世界上最新的桥梁施工法——“管柱钻孔法”，已在武汉长江大桥工地上试验成功。武汉长江大桥采用这种新施工法后，开工日期已由原定的第四季度提前到七月份。大桥的施工总进度也将加快，预计整个工程可以因此提前完工。
    这种新施工法的最大优点是现代化桥梁建筑上的传统的水下施工办法，改为在水上施工建筑起桥墩基础。因此，即使在深水急流中也不受枯水、洪水季节和水位涨落的限制，几乎一年四季都可施工。近一百多年来，全世界的桥梁工程界曾认为“压气沉箱法”是深水河流中建筑桥墩的最科学的方法。但这种施工法只能在枯水季节进行水下施工，如果在建筑长江大桥上采用，每年实际施工时间不过三个月左右。而且长江河槽地质情况复杂，工人进入江底沉箱中工作十分困难，容易发生危险。新施工法避免这些缺点，只需在江面上经过下沉管柱、钻孔、封底、浇灌水下混凝土等工作过程，就能把桥墩从江底上修建起来。在工程成本上，新施工法也比“压气沉箱法”大约可以节省机具、设备等费用百分之十。
    这种新施工法是接受武汉长江大桥工程局苏联专家工作组的建议试验成功的。大桥建设者和苏联专家一起，今年二月开始在长江上进行四个月的艰巨复杂的试验工作。他们共同创制了一种巨大的钢筋混凝土管柱和其他一些新的机具，在江边的一个试验桥墩上，反复进行了试验，即使在风雨中，也坚持不懈。
    新华社武汉二十日讯　在武汉长江大桥正式开工之前，几千个建桥职工曾进行了艰巨浩繁的准备工作。
    大桥的地质勘探工作从一九五零年就开始了，去年到今年，几百个地质钻探人员又详细地查清了大桥桥址的地质和水文情况。这几年中，他们共勘测了八条比较线，最后才选定了桥址。作为大桥工程重要准备步骤的汉水铁桥和汉口、汉阳间的铁路联络线工程，早在去冬今春就已修好，汉水公路桥的桥墩也已修好，正待架设钢梁。不久前，长江大桥的建筑者们又研究和试验好了大桥基础工程的新施工方案，使大桥工程得以提前开工。在整个准备工作期间，并为大桥建筑培养和锻炼了大批施工力量。
