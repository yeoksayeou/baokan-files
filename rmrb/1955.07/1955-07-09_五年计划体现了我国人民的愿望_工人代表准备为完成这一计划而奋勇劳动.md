The worker representatives attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress were very excited when discussing the First Five-Year Plan. They warmly praised the plan, rejoiced at the prospects of our country's construction shown in this plan, and also prepared to complete and over fulfill this plan on schedule with their own creative labor. They are making specific calculations from their own posts, hoping to make more contributions to the completion of this plan.

Meng Tai, special-class labor model of Anshan, director of the repair shop of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said: "After listening to the report on the First Five-Year Plan by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, I know that our responsibility is even greater. The peaceful construction of the motherland needs more steel. In order to enable the blast furnace to produce more iron, our repair shop has strengthened equipment maintenance. This year, three blast furnaces can be spared from major repairs, which can make the blast furnaces produce 110,000 tons more pig iron. In addition, another 40,000 tons of iron can be produced. When our No. 5 blast furnace was started, there was not enough water. We improved the equipment, and we can save more than 20,000 tons of water a year. In order to participate in the great construction of the motherland, we must strive to further strengthen equipment maintenance."

Zhang Zifu, a 39-year-old coal miner and vice chairman of the Fushun Mining Area Trade Union, who is now studying at the Northeast Coal Mine Accelerated Secondary School in Shenyang, said: "After listening to the report on my country's First Five-Year Plan, I know that only our country, only our Communist Party and Chairman Mao, can have the determination to set this great plan. Miners have never had their own schools in history. I couldn't even write my own surname in the past, but now I can read the Worker's Daily. In the past, I was illiterate. In the days of the motherland's great Five-Year Plan, I will improve my culture, improve my technology, and work harder to participate in coal mine construction."

Hu Zhaosen, a technician from Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company who just came from the turbo blower installation site, came to Anshan from Shanghai Jiaotong University at the beginning of the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. With the kind help of Soviet expert Shabashov, he quickly learned the installation of turbo blowers. It took them more than 17,000 man-hours and eight and a half months to install the first turbo blower. The recently completed eighth turbo blower took only 2,000 man-hours and two and a half months. He said: "Our comrades all know that the Five-Year Plan can only be completed with such a fighting spirit. We are now able to work independently. After listening to the report on the First Five-Year Plan, I know that there are many other places in the motherland that need us to go, and we are ready to go to these places at any time.

Lu Agou, a Shanghai industrial labor model, said excitedly: When I saw that the investment in heavy industry in the Five-Year Plan report was so huge, and the country attached so much importance to the development of the machine manufacturing industry, I felt even more the importance of my responsibility today. Our Shanghai machinery workers have a great supporting force for the Northeast and other industrial areas across the country. In the future, our Shanghai workers must give full play to their potential and contribute their labor and wisdom to the realization of my country's First Five-Year Plan.

Wang Meigong, an industrial labor model and people's representative of Shandong Province, said: After discussing the draft Five-Year Plan, I understood the importance of mutual cooperation and support between departments. In the First Five-Year Plan, the focus is on the development of heavy industry. Our textile factories should pay good attention to saving and accumulating funds to support the construction of heavy industry. Cui Dexi, an industrial labor model and people's representative of Shandong Province, said: From the draft Five-Year Plan, I know that coal production is very important for the development of heavy industry, but the production of our Hongshan Coal Mine is still not keeping up with the needs of national construction. We must mobilize all employees to work hard to produce and support national construction. They all believe that after reading the draft Five-Year Plan, they have also seen the beautiful scenery of socialism in concrete terms, and they also know where to use their own strength.

Peng Yangqin, deputy director of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, is a special-class labor model in Wuhan City's industry. He held the draft Five-Year Plan and said excitedly: "The Five-Year Plan of our unit is known and is being implemented, but we urgently hope to know the entire country's Five-Year Plan. This is my mood, and this is the mood of all our factory employees. Knowing the national plan will help us cooperate better with each other." He also said: "In the past, I only thought that my own unit was a key project, and blindly pursued 'comprehensiveness' in all aspects, so there was a lot of waste. Since the central government issued the call to practice strict economy in an all-round way, although there has been a turnaround, there are still some ideas of wanting to relax after this initial effort. Now after reading the Five-Year Plan, it is clear. Not only should non-productive construction plans be cut, but after careful consideration, there are still many other saving tricks, such as how to use existing equipment, etc." Peng Yangqin also thought about how to reduce enterprise management costs in the future. When he talked about the completion of the production plan, their factory had completed the plan for the past two years. In the future, the conditions in all aspects will be better, and the understanding has been improved, so of course there is more confidence in completing the plan. "In short, the Five-Year Plan represents the hope of the working class and also the hope of the people of the whole country," Peng Yangqin said with a hearty laugh at the end.

### 五年计划体现了我国人民的愿望  工人代表准备为完成这一计划而奋勇劳动

    五年计划体现了我国人民的愿望
    工人代表准备为完成这一计划而奋勇劳动
    出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的工人代表，在谈到第一个五年计划时都非常兴奋。他们热烈地赞扬这一计划，为这一计划所展示出来的我国建设的远景而欢欣鼓舞，同时也准备以自己的创造性劳动来如期完成和超额完成这一计划。他们从自己所在的岗位上作着具体的计算，以期能够对这一计划的完成作出更多的贡献。
    鞍山特等劳动模范、鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂修理场场长孟泰说：“我听了李富春副总理的第一个五年计划的报告，我知道我们的责任更加重大了。祖国的和平建设需要更多的钢铁，我们修理场为了使高炉能炼出更多的铁，我们加强了设备维护工作，今年可以使三个高炉免于大修，这样就可以使高炉多炼十一万吨生铁。另外还可以增产四万吨铁。我们的五号高炉开炉，水不够用，我们改进了设备，
  一年可以节省两万多吨水。为了参加祖国的伟大建设，我们一定争取进一步加强设备维护。”
    三十九岁的采煤工、抚顺矿区工会副主席，现在在沈阳东北煤矿速成中学学习的张子富说：“我听了我国第一个五年计划的报告，我知道只有我们的国家，只有我们的共产党和毛主席，才能有决心定出这个伟大的计划。历史上矿工从来没有自己的学校。我过去连自己的姓也不会写，现在我能够看工人日报了。过去我是一个文盲，在祖国伟大的五年计划的日子里，我将提高自己的文化，提高自己的技术，更努力地参加煤矿建设。”
    刚刚从安装透平鼓风机工地来的鞍山钢铁建设公司技术员胡兆森，在第一个五年计划第一年开始的时候，他才从上海交通大学来到鞍山，在苏联专家沙巴少夫的亲切帮助下，很快学会了透平鼓风机的安装工作。他们安装第一台透平鼓风机，共用去
  一万七千多工，八个半月时间。最近完工的第八台透平鼓风机，只用了两千个工，两个半月时间。他说：“我们的同志们都知道，五年计划就是要用这样的战斗精神才能完成的。我们现在已经能够独立工作了，我听了第一个五年计划的报告，知道祖国还有许多别的地方需要我们去，我们随时准备到这些地方去。
    上海工业劳动模范陆阿狗兴奋地说：当我看到五年计划报告中对重工业的投资这样巨大，国家对发展机器制造工业这样重视，越发使我感到今天自己责任的重大。我们上海机械工人对东北以及全国各工业区的支援力量是很大的。今后我们上海工人一定要发挥充分的潜力，为实现我国第一个五年计划而贡献自己的劳动和智慧。
    工业劳动模范、山东省人民代表王美恭说：讨论了五年计划草案以后，我懂得了各部门互相配合和支持的重要。第一个五年计划中着重发展重工业，我们纺织厂应当很好地注意节约，积累资金，支援重工业建设。工业劳动模范、山东省人民代表崔德锡说：从五年计划草案中知道煤的生产对发展重工业很重要，但我们洪山煤矿的生产还赶不上国家建设的需要，我们要发动全体职工，努力生产，支持国家建设。他们都认为看了五年计划草案以后，也就具体地看到了社会主义的美景，自己的力量也知道向那里用了。
    武汉冶电业局副局长彭仰钦是武汉市的工业特等劳动模范。他拿着五年计划草案兴奋地说：
  “本单位的五年计划是知道了，是在执行了，但迫切希望知道整个国家的五年计划。我是这种心情，我们全厂职工都是这种心情。知道了全国的计划，好互相配合得更好一些。”他又说：“过去我只以为自己单位是重点工程，各方面盲目追求‘齐全’，所以浪费很大。自从中央提出全面厉行节约的号召以后，虽然开始有了扭转，但总还有一些一劳永逸的想法。现在看了五年计划，明确了。不仅非生产性建筑计划应该削减，仔细一考虑，其他节约窍门也还多得很，比如如何利用已有的设备等”。彭仰钦还想到今后该如何降低企业管理费用等问题。他说起完成生产计划情况，过去两年多以来，他们厂都完成了计划，今后各方面条件更好，认识上又有了提高，当然更有信心完成计划。“总之，五年计划，它代表了工人阶级的希望，也是全国人民的希望。”彭仰钦最后朗爽地笑着说。
