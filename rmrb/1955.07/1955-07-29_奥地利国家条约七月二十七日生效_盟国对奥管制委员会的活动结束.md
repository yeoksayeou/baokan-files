Xinhua News Agency, July 28th – According to TASS: On July 27th, France deposited its instrument of ratification of the Austrian State Treaty with the Soviet government. Prior to this, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Austria had already deposited their instruments of ratification. The Austrian State Treaty stipulates that the treaty shall enter into force immediately upon the deposit of instruments of ratification by the signatory states with the Soviet government. Therefore, with France's deposit, the Austrian State Treaty took effect on July 27th.

On the 27th, the Allied Control Council for Austria held its final meeting in Vienna. The Soviet High Commissioner to Austria, Ilyichev, the French High Commissioner, Seydoux, the British High Commissioner, Wallinger, and the United States Acting High Commissioner, Panfield, attended the meeting. The four High Commissioners all made statements.

Ilyichev's statement pointed out that the entry into force of the Austrian State Treaty will open a new page in Austrian history. Austria has announced that it will pursue a policy of permanent neutrality, which is of great significance for consolidating peace in Europe and is very satisfactory to the Austrian people and other peace-loving people of other countries.

Ilyichev wished the Austrian people and their government continuous success in developing Austria into a democratic, independent, and neutral country, and expressed that the Soviet Union will continue to work to develop and consolidate friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Austria.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of a resolution on the cessation of activities of the Allied Control Council for Austria. After the meeting, a ceremony was held to lower the flags of the four countries from the building of the Allied Control Council for Austria.

Austrian President Körner and Prime Minister Raab delivered radio speeches in Vienna on the 27th on the occasion of the entry into force of the Austrian State Treaty. Körner said, "The consensus of the major powers has generated new hope for the restoration of world peace and paved the way for the just resolution of difficult problems... We Austrians must abide by our promises and never participate in any struggle other than the struggle for peace and justice."

    奥地利国家条约七月二十七日生效
    盟国对奥管制委员会的活动结束
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社讯：法国在二十七日向苏联政府交存了批准奥地利国家条约的批准书。在这以前，苏联、美国、英国、奥地利已经分别交存了这个条约的批准书。奥地利国家条约规定这个条约在条约签字各国把批准书交存苏联政府后立即生效，所以，法国交存批准书后，奥地利国家条约已经在七月二十七日生效。
    二十七日，在维也纳的盟国对奥管制委员会举行最后一次会议。驻奥地利的苏联高级专员伊利切夫、法国高级专员赛杜、英国高级专员华林格尔和美国代理高级专员潘菲德参加了会议，四国高级专员都发表了声明。
    伊利切夫的声明指出，奥地利国家条约的生效将在奥地利历史上展开新的一页。奥地利已经宣布将奉行永久中立的政策，这对于巩固欧洲和平有重大意义，使奥地利人民和其他国家爱好和平人民非常满意。
    伊利切夫祝奥地利人民和他们的政府在使奥地利发展成为民主、独立和中立的国家方面不断地取得成就，并且表示苏联将继续为发展和巩固苏奥两国友好关系而努力。
    会议最后通过了盟国对奥管制委员会活动结束的决议。会议以后，举行了把盟国对奥管制委员会大厦上的四国国旗降下的仪式。
    奥地利总统柯尔纳和总理拉布在二十七日在维也纳为奥地利国家条约生效发表广播演说。柯尔纳说，“各大国的一致精神产生了恢复世界和平的新希望，为公正地解决困难问题铺平了道路……我们奥地利人要遵守我们的诺言，除了争取和平和正义的斗争外，我们永不参加其他斗争。”
