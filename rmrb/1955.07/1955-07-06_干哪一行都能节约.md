　　Saving Can Be Done in Any Line of Work
　　Yang Jing
    Can one save money doing purchasing work? Yu Lianfang, a purchasing agent at the capital construction department of Chongqing No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant, initially thought that if the construction site needed certain materials, using the factory's backlog of dead stock might be a way to save. As for other things, it was hard to say. Later, in his actual work, Yu Lianfang gradually refuted his original view.
    Last August, in order to welcome the start of power transmission from the 507 power plant, the factory built a new substation. The substation's factory building was built, and the machines were installed, but it was missing the purple copper nameplates for the switchgear.
    Yu Lianfang received the task of purchasing the purple copper nameplates and went to the city. He went to the Third Engineering Team of the Southwest Electric Power Administration Bureau to inquire. The engineering team did not have any purple copper nameplates and introduced him to a private copper factory to place an order. He ran to that copper factory and saw only a few copper drawing machines, not even a copper smelting furnace.
    "Place an order with him?" Yu Lianfang thought as he looked around.
  "Hmm, no way. If you buy from him, he'll just buy from somewhere else and take advantage of you!"
    Although the capitalist's business personnel repeatedly stated that the price could be "negotiated," Yu Lianfang still went to another private factory with a copper melting furnace to inquire. If it were in the past, he would have placed an order here at the market price of eleven yuan per kilogram, and no one would have said he was cheated when buying things. However, this time he thought of another problem.
    "Where does your copper come from?" he asked.
    "Bought scrap copper," the capitalist's business personnel said.
    "How much is the processing fee per kilogram?" he asked again.
    "Three yuan and eighty cents," the other party said.
    This gave him an idea: he could save a lot of money by buying old copper wire for processing himself. And he often saw a lot of waste copper wire left over in the warehouses of other factories.
      "I'll bring waste copper wire for processing, and we'll sign a contract later," he told the other party before heading back.
    Yu Lianfang bought back the required waste copper wire, which was only worth two yuan per kilogram. Including processing fees and various expenses, it only cost a little over seven yuan per kilogram. This saved the state more than two thousand yuan.
      This incident educated him and made him realize that it was possible to save money in procurement work. After that, whenever he was asked to purchase something, he would always think in his heart: I must save money.
    Last October, the grinding machine parts needed on the construction site had already been decided to be ordered from Chongqing Machine Iron Factory. Later, the iron factory's business personnel told Yu Lianfang when calculating the unit price that the ball bearings used on the machine were foreign goods according to the drawings, but they only had Shanghai goods here. If he wanted to buy foreign goods, he would have to go to Shanghai.
    At this time, if it were a purchasing agent who didn't use his brain, he would think: Just buy them in Shanghai, what about the money? I'll get reimbursed later. Yu Lianfang didn't think that way. He thought: Why can't Shanghai goods be used instead if they're not foreign goods? Hadn't he heard the technical staff at the factory say that if the machine's rotation speed per minute was too high, the quality of the ball bearings would cause accidents if they were slightly inferior, but what if the speed was slow? He decided to go to the construction site to find out.
    "Is this machine rotating very fast?" Yu Lianfang asked.
    "Not at all."
    "Not fast?" He was moved by this. "Please show me the drawings."
    It turned out to be only a dozen revolutions per minute.
    "It can definitely be substituted," Yu Lianfang affirmed in his heart.
    He roughly calculated that using Shanghai goods would save more than eight hundred yuan. However, this was ultimately a technical issue, and he wasn't confident in his own judgment. That day, he rushed back to the factory to consult with the designers.
    "Do these ball bearings have to be foreign goods?" he asked the technician who budgeted materials in the engineering team.
    "I don't know, go ask the person who designed the drawings."
    He had no choice but to ask the technician who designed the drawings.
    "Can Shanghai goods be used instead? If they can be substituted, it can save more than eight hundred yuan," Yu Lianfang intentionally said the latter sentence loudly.
    "The rotation speed is not high, so it's possible," the designer said after looking at the drawings.
    How dangerous, a careless action would have wasted a large sum of money! Yu Lianfang was especially happy in his heart.
    In this way, because he always paid attention to saving, he saved the country a total of more than fifteen thousand yuan in the second half of last year.
    After the factory launched the anti-waste campaign, his understanding of the importance of saving became clearer and more profound. Whenever materials passed through his hands for purchase, he had to consider: whether it was necessary to buy them, and whether the materials to be bought could be substituted, etc. He said, "If we don't do this, it will cause waste and stockpiling."
    At the end of April this year, the supply team asked him to go to the city to buy magnetic bushings. When Yu Lianfang arrived at the office of the state-owned Yibin Electric Porcelain Factory in the city, he heard the purchasing staff at the office say that Engineer Zhang from the factory's capital construction office had said that they would not be needed for the time being.
    "Not needed?" Was it that they weren't needed in the past but were now needed, or were they not needed now? He ran back to the factory in a puff of smoke.
    "Do we need the magnetic bushings after all?" he asked the person in the team who compiled the purchase plan.
    "The plan has been compiled, of course we need them, just buy them back,"
    He refused to believe it and went to ask the person who budgeted materials in the engineering team.
    "That's right, just order them," the other party replied without thinking.
    Since both people said so, what was the problem? Yu Lianfang wanted to leave. But he thought: Didn't they say that Engineer Zhang said they weren't needed? Why not ask him directly!
    He found Engineer Zhang Yuancheng.
    "Are the magnetic bushings still needed now?" he asked.
    "I said long ago that they weren't needed," the engineer said. "There's no need for them at all!"
    Yu Lianfang was a little angry when he heard this, he almost wasted two thousand yuan again, he had to give them some feedback.
    "Comrade, the designer planned not to use them a long time ago, why are you still calling for them to be purchased? Aren't you intentionally wasting money?" he criticized the person who budgeted materials in the engineering team. The other party was speechless and didn't know how to answer. Later, the engineering team, based on his criticism, studied ways to plug loopholes.
    Yu Lianfang, this young purchasing agent, realized the possibility of saving and its significance in his work. He said, "Saving can be done in any line of work! If we don't save, where will the money to build new factories come from!" (Reprinted from Chongqing Daily)

### 干哪一行都能节约

　　干哪一行都能节约
　　杨竞
    干采购这一行也能节约么？重庆第二钢铁厂基本建设科的采购员余连芳，开始对这个问题的看法是：如果工地上需要某种材料时，利用一下别的厂积压下来的呆料倒是可以节约的；其余呢，就很难讲了。后来，在实际工作中，余连芳逐渐否定了自己原来的看法。
    去年八月，厂里为了迎接五零七电厂开始输电，新修了一个变电站。变电站的厂房修起来了，机器也安装了，就是差开关柜的紫铜牌。
    余连芳接到了购买紫铜牌的任务，就跑到城里去。他到西南电业管理局第三工程队去打听，工程队没有紫铜牌，就介绍他到一家私营铜厂去订货。他跑到那个铜厂一看，只有几部拉铜的机器，连炼铜的炉子也没有。
    “找他订货么？”余连芳一边看一边盘算。
  “嗯，不行，你向他买，他还不是向别处买进，趁此捞你一把！”
    虽然资方业务人员一再申明价钱可以“商量”，余连芳仍然到另一个有熔铜炉的私厂打听去了。如果照往常，他就会在这里订货，按照市价，将是十一元一公斤，谁都不会说他买东西时上了当。可是，他这时候却想到了另一个问题。
    “你们的铜是哪来的？”他问。
    “买的废铜。”资方业务人员说。
    “加工费多少钱一公斤？”他又问。
    “三元八角。”对方又说。
    这一下，他心里有底了：自己买旧铜线来加工能省很多钱。而他，经常在别的厂里看到仓库里剩下很多废铜线的。
      “我拿废铜线来加工，回头我们就订合同。”他向对方交代了以后，就往回走。
    余连芳买回来了所需要的废铜线，这废铜线只值两元多钱一公斤，加上加工费和各种开支，每公斤也只要七元多。这一下，就为国家节约了两千多元。
      这件事教育了他，使他体会到在采购工作中是可以节约的。此后，凡是叫他采购什么，他在心里就总这么想：一定要节约。
    去年十月，工地上需要的沙轮打磨机的配件，已经决定在重庆机器铁工厂订货了。后来，铁工厂的业务人员在计算单价时告诉余连芳，机器上用的弹子照图纸规定是外国货，但这里只有上海货，要买外国货就得到上海去买。
    这时，如果是不动脑筋的采购员，他就会想：到上海去买就买呗，钱么？回头报销就是。余连芳却不这样。他想：为什么不是外国货就不行呢？难道上海货不可以代用么？在厂里时，他曾经听技术人员说过，假使机器每分钟的旋转速度太大，弹子的质量稍差就会发烧造成事故，要是速度慢又怎样呢？他决定到工地了解一下。
    “这机器转数大不大？”余连芳问。
    “根本不大。”
    “不大么？”他心里动了一下。“请你把图纸拿来看看”。
    原来每分钟只十多转。
    “一定可以代用。”余连芳在心里这样肯定。
    他粗略的计算了一下，如果用上海货，就可以节约八百多元。可是，这毕竟是技术问题，自己拿不稳，当天，他就赶回厂去找设计的人商量。
    “这弹子一定要外货么？”他问工程组那个预算材料的技术员。
    “我不知道，你去问设计图纸的人吧”。
    他只好去问设计图纸的技术员。
    “是不是可以用上海货代替？能代替就可以节约八百多元哩。”余连芳有意把后面这一句说得很响。
    “转数不大，是可以的。”设计人把图纸看了看后说。
    好险呵，一不细心就会浪费一大笔钱呢！余连芳心里格外高兴。
    就这样，由于他随时注意节约，去年下半年一共给国家节约了一万五千多元。
    厂里开展反浪费斗争以后，他对节约的重要意义认识得更清楚更深刻了。凡是经过他手里去采购的材料，他都要考虑：是否有买的必要、要买的材料是否可以代用等等。他说：“不这样，就会造成浪费和积压”。
    今年四月底，有一回供应组叫他进城买磁套管。余连芳到了城里国营宜宾电瓷厂办事处，听办事处的采购人员说，厂基本建设处的张工程师曾谈过暂时不用了。
    “不用啦？”是过去不用现在又需要用啦？还是现在就不用啦？他一溜烟跑回厂里去了。
    “磁套管到底需不需要呵？”他问组里编采购计划的人。
    “计划都编出来了，当然需要呵，你只管买回来就行。”
    他不肯信，又去问工程组预算材料的人。
    “对头，你订货就是。”对方不加思索地顺口回答。
    两个人都这么说，那还有什么问题呢，余连芳本想抽身走了。但，他想：不是说张工程师讲的不要了么？何不直接问问他呢！
    他找到了工程师张远程。
    “磁套管现在还需要么？”他问。
    “老早就说过不需要啦，”工程师说：“根本用不着它嘛！”
    余连芳一听，真是有些生气，又差一点浪费两千元啦，非给他们提提意见不可。
    “同志，设计的人早就打算不用它了，你为什么还在叫采购？你这不是有意浪费么？”他批评工程组预算材料的那个人。对方张口结舌，不知怎么回答。后来，工程组根据他的批评，研究了堵塞漏洞的办法。
    余连芳，这个年轻的采购员，就是这样从工作当中认识到了节约的可能性和它的意义。他说：“干哪一行都能节约呢！不节约，建设新厂房的钱从哪儿来呢！”（转载重庆日报）
