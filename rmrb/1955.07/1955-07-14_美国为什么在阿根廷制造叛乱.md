Why the United States is Creating Rebellion in Argentina
    Qin Benli

    Since June, Argentina has experienced unrest and rebellion against the Argentine government instigated by the United States. Those participating in these disturbances and rebellions include some figures from the Navy and Catholics. As late as the 10th, these disturbances by Catholics were still occurring. What do people see from these events?

    First, this once again illustrates that the United States is hostile to the independent and autonomous policies of all countries. To force other countries to follow the United States and abandon independence and autonomy, it can use all methods, through any means, to threaten, entice, and even subvert the governments of those countries. Many legitimate governments in Latin America, such as the previous government of Guatemala, have been overthrown because they did not suit the United States. Argentina is a major country in Latin America. It is under various pressures from the United States, but for the sake of its own national interests, it cannot completely follow the will of the United States. It hopes to open up its own path in politics, economy, and trade, and get rid of the United States' forceful control. Therefore, for many years, the United States has frequently conducted a cold war in propaganda against the Argentine government. For example, no one can imagine that the Argentine government might have any connection with communism, but in April of this year, the so-called "Communist Activities in Latin America" investigation material published by the United States Information Service actually accused the Argentine government of economic and cultural ties with the peaceful democratic camp, and sensationally claimed that the peaceful democratic camp was increasing its "interest" in Argentina. It attempted to link the so-called "communist threat" with Argentina to create an unreasonable basis for its interference in Argentina's internal affairs and subversive activities.

    While conducting cold war propaganda against Argentina, the United States also took practical actions to subvert the Argentine government. The United States instigated two armed rebellions in Argentina in 1951 and 1953. This year is the third time. After the failure of this armed rebellion, the United States government, through Thomas Gordon, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement, as usual, shirking the United States' responsibility, saying that this rebellion "was an action planned by anti-Peron forces and communists." It attempted to imply that the Peron government was unstable and to frame the communists in order to divert people's attention.

    However, the facts cannot be concealed. Even American newspapers now admit that this armed rebellion "was largely carried out by the Navy," and the Argentine Navy "has traditional ties with the United States." This traditional relationship can be traced back to 1935. At that time, the United States sent a naval mission to work in Argentina. In 1948, there were also United States naval and air force missions stationed in Argentina. In 1954, the American "Courier" magazine revealed that "in every Latin American country today, there is a United States training delegation or a military assistance advisory group or both..." But, unfortunately for the United States: "In Argentina, the United States Naval Advisory Group must limit its activities to a carefully considered and formulated scope." The one who launched this armed rebellion was the Argentine Navy Minister Olivieri. Just before this armed rebellion, he went to the United States and stayed there for a whole month.

    There is an old Chinese saying: "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." The fact that the United States interferes in Argentina's internal affairs and attempts to subvert the Argentine government shows that the "communist aggression" and "communist subversive activities" that the United States clamors about everywhere are all to pave the way for its ambition to control all countries and then dominate the world.

    The United States' use of religion to endanger Argentina's security is especially worthy of deep attention and vigilance.

    In the past, Argentina implemented a system of unity of politics and religion. Now, the Argentine government advocates the separation of politics and religion. It has dismissed Catholic priests who served in public schools, abolished the law that made Catholicism the state religion, and announced the law of separation of the church from the state. All of this is the internal affair of a sovereign country, and no outsider can interfere.

    However, the United States, on this issue, shamefully interfered in Argentina by using religion. The rebellion of the Argentine Navy that it instigated was backed by a part of the Catholic Church supported by the United States. These Catholic churches, which serve the interests of the United States, have continuously driven Catholics to cooperate with the Navy's rebellion to carry out multiple disturbances, threatening Argentina's security. They even shouted the slogan "Long live the Navy." It is obviously not accidental that on the same day that the Argentine Navy carried out the rebellion, the Catholic Pope excommunicated Peron and other Argentine government officials. According to the Argentine Constitution, only Catholics can be president. Removing Peron's church membership is to find a way to further overthrow the Argentine government, that is, to hope that "Peron will meet his end."

    The Argentine government's arrest of priests who created the riots and the expulsion of relevant Catholic leaders are Argentina's exercise of its sovereignty and laws. This, like the question of whether Argentina maintains or abolishes the system of unity of politics and religion, has nothing to do with the United States, and the United States has absolutely no right to interfere. But in order to maintain and intensify the tense situation in Argentina, the senators of the United States Senate actually clamored and openly demanded that protests be lodged with Argentina. According to the logic of the United States, is the country concerned obliged to protect the riots and saboteurs supported by the United States according to the will of the United States?

    The United States' use of religion to carry out cold war and destructive activities against other countries, attempting to force other countries to accept United States control, is an intolerable matter in international relations. It is a constant threat to the security of all countries. This threat will not change because the United States shouts "religious freedom." In fact, true religious freedom is no longer what the United States wants. Many American church people have been severely persecuted because they do not approve of the United States' war policy. The so-called religious "freedom" that the United States wants is the "freedom" of the United States to use religion to carry out subversive activities against independent countries and control other countries in order to achieve the goal of world domination.

    This is people's understanding of the disturbances and rebellions that occurred in Argentina.

    美国为什么在阿根廷制造叛乱
    钦本立
    六月以来，阿根廷发生了美国指使发动的反对阿根廷政府的骚动和叛乱。参加这些骚动和叛乱的有海军一些人物和天主教徒。直到十日，天主教徒的这种骚动还在发生。从这些事件中，人们看到了
  一些什么呢？
    首先，这又一次说明，美国仇视一切国家的独立自主政策。为了迫使其他国家追随美国，放弃独立自主，它可以用一切方法，经过任何途径来威胁利诱，甚至颠覆那些国家的政府。拉丁美洲许多合法政府，例如危地马拉上届政府，因为不合美国的心意被它推翻了。阿根廷是拉丁美洲的一个大国。它处在美国的各种压力之下，但是它为了自己国家的利益，不能完全听从美国的意志。它希望在政治、经济、贸易上打开一些自己的道路，摆脱美国的强力控制。因此，多年以来，美国在宣传上经常对阿根廷政府进行冷战。例如，任何人都不能想像阿根廷政府可能同共产主义有什么关联，但是，今年四月，美国新闻处公布的所谓“共产党在拉丁美洲的活动”的调查材料，竟指责阿根廷政府同和平民主阵营的经济文化联系，并耸人听闻地说什么和平民主阵营对阿根廷增加“兴趣”。它企图把所谓“共产主义威胁”同阿根廷联系起来，为它干涉阿根廷内政、进行颠覆活动制造毫无道理的根据。
    美国一面对阿根廷进行冷战宣传，一面用实际行动来颠覆阿根廷政府。一九五一年一九五三年美国在阿根廷先后策动了两次武装叛变。今年是第三次了。在这次武装叛变失败之后，美国官方通过众议院外交委员会主席托马斯·戈登发表声明，照例推卸美国的责任，说这次叛变“倒是反庇隆势力和共产党策划的行动”。它企图这样来暗示庇隆政府不稳定，并嫁祸于共产党以转移人们的视线。
    然而，事实是掩盖不住的。现在连美国报刊也承认，这次武装叛变“在很大程度上是由海军干的”，而阿根廷的海军“是同美国的传统有关系的”。这种传统的关系可追溯到一九三五年。那时美国就派遣了海军使团在阿根廷工作。一九四八年，又有美国海、空军使团驻在阿根廷。一九五四年美国“信使”月刊透露，“在每一个拉丁美洲国家中，今天都有一个美国训练代表团或军事援助顾问团或二者都有……”但是，对美国不幸的是：“在阿根廷美国海军顾问团须将活动限制在一个经过详细考虑而制定的范围之内”。这次发动武装叛变的就是阿根廷海军部长奥利维里。就在这次武装叛变之前，他曾经到美国去，整整住了一个月。
    中国有句老话：“要得人不知，除非已莫为”。美国干涉阿根廷内政，企图颠覆阿根廷政府的事实说明，美国到处叫嚣的“共产主义侵略”、“共产党颠覆活动”，都是为了替它控制各国，进而独霸世界的野心开路。
    美国利用宗教来危害阿根廷安全的行为，尤其是值得人们深深注意和警惕。
    在阿根廷，过去实行着政教合一的制度。现在，阿根廷政府主张政教分开。它解雇了在公立学校任职的天主教教士，废除了以天主教为国教的法案，宣布了教会从国家分离的法律。所有这一切都是一个主权国家的内政，任何外人是不能加以干涉的。
    但是，美国就在这个问题上，利用宗教对阿根廷进行了可耻的干涉。它策动的阿根廷海军的叛乱，就是以美国支持的一部分天主教教会为后盾的。这些为美国利益服务的天主教教会，竟然连续驱使天主教教徒配合海军的叛乱进行多次骚动，使阿根廷的安全受到威胁。他们甚至高呼“海军万岁”的口号。美国报纸极力为他们助威，希望“庇隆走向末路”。在这种情势下，在阿根廷海军进行叛乱的同一天，天主教教皇革去庇隆和其他阿根廷政府官员的天主教教籍，显然不是偶然的。根据阿根廷宪法，只有天主教徒能当总统，革去庇隆的教籍，就是想为进一步推翻阿根廷政府寻找道路，也就是希望“庇隆走向末路”。
    阿根廷政府逮捕制造骚乱的教士，把有关的天主教首脑人物驱逐出境，是阿根廷行使自己的主权和法律。这和阿根廷保持或废除政教合一制度的问题一样，是与美国毫不相干，美国完全无权干涉的事情。但是为保持和加剧阿根廷的紧张局势，美国参议院的议员们竟然大肆叫嚣，并且公然要求向阿根廷提出抗议。难道照美国的逻辑，当事国家有义务按照美国的意旨来保护受美国支持的骚乱和破坏分子吗？
    美国利用宗教来对别的国家进行冷战和破坏活动，企图迫使其他国家接受美国的控制，是一件国际关系上不能容忍的事情。它对各国的安全是经常的威胁。这种威胁决不因为美国叫喊“宗教自由”而有所改变。事实上真正的宗教自由早已不是美国所要的东西。许多美国教会人士因为不赞成美国的战争政策而受到了严重的迫害。美国所要的所谓宗教“自由”，是美国利用宗教来对独立国家进行颠覆活动，控制其他国家以便达到独霸世界目的的“自由”。
    这就是人们对在阿根廷发生的骚动和叛乱的认识。
