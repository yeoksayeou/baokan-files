The United States recently passed a bill deciding to extend the "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act," which expired in June of this year, for three years; and authorizing the US President to reduce tariffs by 15 percent over the next three years, i.e., 5 percent each year.

The Associated Press boasted about this bill, saying: "This is a huge victory for the President in what he calls a key measure in supporting the free world against Communism."

However, the reactions of other capitalist countries have not been enthusiastic. Some countries have even expressed dissatisfaction. There is a reason for this.

On the surface, the United States has made a concession in terms of tariffs this time. But in reality, under the guise of reducing tariffs, the United States is attempting to further strengthen dumping and more tightly block the domestic market. It will only make the capitalist world market more chaotic and make the economies of backward capitalist countries more difficult.

The "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act" has always been one of the tools used by the United States to expand foreign markets and plunder cheap raw materials. According to the "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act," the US President has the power to sign agreements with foreign countries to mutually reduce tariffs. After World War II, the United States took advantage of the widespread implementation of the "Marshall Plan" and the opportunity to forcibly apportion surplus goods to force countries receiving "aid" from the Marshall Plan and their colonies to reduce tariffs on goods imported from the United States. At that time, countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway made significant concessions on import taxes on many American goods (mainly including equipment, automobiles, chemicals, airplanes, cameras, typewriters, textiles, and other industrial products, as well as wheat, etc.). The United States itself hardly changed the tariffs levied on foreign manufactured goods; the tariffs that were reduced were mainly various raw materials needed by American monopoly capital and agricultural and mineral products produced by American capital invested abroad.

The United States also uses the "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act" to block the domestic market. The "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act" is accompanied by so-called "exception clauses." According to the provisions of these clauses, if import and export commodities under reciprocal tariff reduction agreements "cause serious damage or pose a threat" to American domestic industry, American manufacturers can request that the tariffs on imported commodities that have been reduced be raised again. As soon as a domestic manufacturer expresses an opinion on an imported commodity, the US Customs uses various methods to delay or stop the import of this commodity, waiting for a discussion and decision. This decision often takes a long time to make, and this commodity cannot be imported into the United States. According to a report in the American "Time" magazine, at the end of 1953, approximately 750,000 import commodity declaration applications were still waiting to be resolved on inspectors' desks. Some British economists compare the difficulty for industrialists and businessmen from other countries to sell their products to the United States to the difficulty of making water flow uphill.

The London "Economist" vividly described the US's trade policy of building high tariff barriers itself while only dumping goods abroad: "The United States is seeking two worlds - one where it can freely sell its surpluses, and another where other countries cannot freely sell agricultural products to it."

In 1954, in order to expand commodity exports, the United States took out 5.2 billion US dollars to "help" other countries, actually relying on national loans and subsidies to forcibly export. According to the "New York Times," 25 percent of American exported commodities in 1954 were subsidized by American "foreign aid" appropriations.

The United States also forcibly exports by funding through the Export-Import Bank and other channels. In 1954, the Export-Import Bank's export loan amount expanded to 5 billion US dollars. In addition, it also used various means, such as forcing other countries to sign bilateral or triangular agreements on the supply of "surplus" agricultural products by the United States with payment in local currency, to strengthen dumping.

In the past two or three years, this trade policy of harming others to benefit oneself has been increasingly opposed by other capitalist countries. In 1952, other capitalist countries, led by the United Kingdom, put forward the slogan of "trade, not aid" to the United States, demanding that the United States open up its domestic market, relax "embargoes," and restore trade relations with democratic camp countries, and so on. In order to step up the sale of their own commodities and protect their own markets, these capitalist countries have not only increasingly stepped up their resistance to the United States' foreign trade policy, but have also squeezed out American commodities from their own positions. In 1953 and 1954, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Italy, and many other countries increased the import taxes on several commodities. In order to stimulate commodity exports, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and other countries also expanded capital exports and government export subsidies. Even for export credit, large-scale government guarantees are provided.

The United States' foreign trade volume in 1954 decreased by 5.2 percent compared to 1953, with exports decreasing by 4.5 percent and imports decreasing by 6.2 percent. The situation of large-scale export reductions has caused extreme anxiety among American politicians and business people.

It is in this context that the United States has made the decision to reduce tariffs by 15 percent over the next three years, attempting to play new tricks in terms of tariff policy. Because the United States has accumulated a large number of "surplus" commodities, especially "surplus" agricultural products, which urgently need to be dumped abroad; because enterprises seriously hit by the crisis, such as the textile industry, coal industry, etc., as well as smaller enterprises such as bicycles, dairy cheese products, and wool, need the domestic market even more, this determines that the United States' tariff reduction measures this time cannot but serve the purpose of continuing to expand abroad and further closing the domestic market.

First of all, the United States' current tariff rates are much higher than those of other capitalist countries, and reducing tariffs by 5 percent each year for the next three years is insignificant. After this tariff reduction, the United States' tariff rates are still high and are still in an advantageous position compared to the tariff rates of other capitalist country groups. The United States' tariff barriers have not really been reduced. Even if tariffs are reduced by 5 percent each year for certain commodities over the next three years, it will not lead to a significant increase in US imports.

Secondly, the United States will reduce tariffs by 5 percent each year for the next three years on the condition that it receives similar concessions from other countries. That is to say, whether the United States' tariff rates are reduced depends on whether other countries also reduce tariffs accordingly. Eisenhower said in his State of the Union address in January of this year: "We must gradually reduce some tariff barriers in trade. Of course, while taking this action, other countries should also reduce trade barriers..."

It should also be pointed out that the new tax reduction bill passed by the US Congress not only did not abolish the so-called "exception clauses" in the "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act," but on the contrary, expanded the scope of application of the "exception clauses." For example, if reducing tariffs causes a certain imported commodity to "threaten" American domestic industry, thereby weakening the role of "national security," the US President has the power to restrict imports by raising tariffs or import quotas. In May, the "New York Times" revealed that there "is already an understanding that the President will make the most of this power" in invoking the clause restricting imports due to "national security." Another example of expanding the "exception clauses" under the original "Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act" is: in the case where the same manufacturer produces multiple products, if imported commodities cause "damage" to a certain product or there is a "threat," even if the manufacturer's overall profits still increase, it can independently request that tariffs be raised again on imported commodities that "threaten" a certain product.

After the tax reduction bill was passed by Congress, the US Senate increased the tariff on imported hardboard by about double. The Swedish, Finnish, and Canadian ambassadors to the United States protested to the US State Department.

The new tax reduction bill also stipulates that the date on which the tax reduction rate is based is set as January 1, 1955. At the same time, the provisions for tax reduction cannot be invoked for countries that have not signed reciprocal tariff reduction agreements on January 1 of this year. This is particularly unfavorable for Japan. Because the negotiations and completion of the mutual tariff reduction between Japan and the United States took place after January 1. Japanese newspaper commentaries said that while the United States is trying to prevent Japan from trading with its neighbors, it is unwilling to reduce American tariff barriers on Japanese goods. The Japan Tariff Association, composed of Japanese private merchants, pointed out the unfair trade situation between Japan and the United States, saying: "When almost all Japanese goods sold to the United States are subject to tariffs of 30 to 70 percent, most of the American goods purchased by Japan are only subject to tariffs of 5 to 15 percent."

When the United States' United Press reported the news of Eisenhower signing the bill granting him the power to reduce tariffs, it pointed out: "There are some clauses included in this law that will make it easier for American industry to ask the president to raise tariffs to protect them from harm than at any time since the implementation of this 21-year-old plan."

Obviously, the United States has not changed its consistent tariff policy of harming others to benefit itself. The so-called new tax law still serves the interests of American monopoly capital. The American news agency publicized that this measure is a key measure for the "free world" to oppose "communism," and its purpose is only to divert people's attention from the true meaning of the American tariff reduction.

    美国降低关税的真实意义
    钦本立
    最近美国国会通过一个法案，决定把今年六月满期的“互惠贸易协定法”延长三年；并授权美国总统在今后三年内减低关税百分之十五，即今后三年每年减低百分之五。
    美联社为这个法案吹嘘说：“这是总统在他所谓支持自由世界反对共产主义的努力中的一个关键性措施方面的一个巨大胜利”。
    但是，其他资本主义国家的反应却并不热烈。有些国家还表示不满。这是有缘故的。
    从表面上看，美国这次在关税方面是作了一次让步。但是，实际上这是美国在减低关税的幌子下，企图进一步加强对外倾销和更严密地封锁国内市场。它只有使资本主义世界市场更加混乱，使落后的资本主义国家的经济更加困难。
    “互惠贸易协定法”是美国一向作为扩大国外市场和掠夺廉价原料的工具之一。根据“互惠贸易协定法”，美国总统有同外国签订相互减低关税协定的权力。第二次大战以后，美国利用广泛施行“马歇尔计划”，用强迫摊派的办法来推销过剩商品的机会，迫使接受马歇尔计划“援助”的国家及其殖民地降低了从美国进口商品所征的关税。当时，英国、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、瑞典、丹麦、挪威等国，对许多美国商品（主要包括设备、汽车、化学品、飞机、照相机、打字机、纺织品及其他工业品，以及小麦等）所征的进口税都作了重大的让步。而美国自己，对外国工业制成品所征的关税几乎是原封不动；减低了关税的，主要也只是美国垄断资本所需要的各种原料和美国资本在国外投资出产的农矿产品而已。
    美国还利用“互惠贸易协定法”来封锁国内市场。“互惠贸易协定法”附有所谓“例外条款”。根据这些条款的规定，在相互减低关税协定下的进出口商品，如果对美国国内工业“带有严重的损害或存在着威胁时”，美国厂商就可要求对已减税的进口商品重新提高关税。一种进口商品只要国内厂商一提出意见以后，美国海关就用各种办法延缓或停止这种商品进口，等候讨论决定。这种决定往往很长时间也做不出来，这种商品也就不能向美国进口。据美国“时代”周刊报道，一九五三年底，约有七十五万件进口商品报关申请，还在检查员办公桌上有待解决。英国有些经济学者比喻其他国家的工商业家要把自己的产品向美国出售，好像让水向山上流那末困难。
    伦敦“经济学家”周刊曾生动地描述了美国这种自己高筑关税壁垒而只是向外倾销的贸易政策：“美国是在寻求两个世界——一个是它可以放手出售它的剩余品的世界，另一个是其他国家都不能向它自由出售农业品的世界”。
    一九五四年，美国为了扩大商品输出，拿出了五十二亿美元来“帮助”其他国家，实际上是依靠国家的贷款和津贴来强行出口。据“纽约时报”报道，一九五四年美国出口商品的百分之二十五都是由美国“援外”拨款补助输出的。
    美国还通过进出口银行等出资帮助强行输出。一九五四年美国进出口银行的出口贷款额扩大到五十亿美元。此外，还施展了各种手段，如强迫其他国家签订关于由美国供应“剩余”农产品而以当地货币支付的双边或三角协定等等来加强倾销。
    美国这种损人利己的贸易政策，近二、三年来已遭到其他资本主义国家越来越多的反对。在一九五二年，以英国为首的其他资本主义国家向美国提出了“要贸易、不要援助”的口号，要求美国开放国内市场放宽“封锁禁运”和恢复对民主阵营国家的贸易关系，等等。这些资本主义国家为了加紧推销自己的商品，并保护本国的市场，不仅日益加紧地反抗美国的对外贸易政策，而且还从自己的阵地上排挤美国商品。在一九五三年和一九五四年，英国、法国、西德、意大利和许多国家都提高了若干商品的进口税。英国、法国、西德和其他国家，为了刺激商品输出，还扩大了资本输出和政府的出口补助金。甚至对于出口信贷也大规模地提供国家担保。
    美国一九五四年对外贸易额，比一九五三年缩减了百分之五·二，出口减少了百分之四·五，进口则减少了百分之六·二。出口大形缩减的情况，引起美国政界和商界人士的极度不安。
    就在这种情况下，美国作出了今后三年降低关税百分之十五的决定，企图在关税政策方面玩弄新花样。由于美国国内积有大批“过剩”商品，特别是“剩余”农产品，急需向外倾销；由于受到危机严重打击的企业如纺织业、煤业等以及自行车、乳制酪品、羊毛等较小企业更加需要国内市场，这就决定了美国这次减低关税的措施不能不服务于继续对外扩张和进一步封闭国内市场的目的。
    首先，美国现行关税税率远高于其他资本主义国家，今后三年内每年降低关税百分之五，这是微不足道的。经过这次降低税率以后，美国关税税率也还是高的，同其他资本主义国家集团的关税税率相比还是处于优势地位。美国关税壁垒并没有真正有所降低。即使今后三年内对某些商品每年降低关税百分之五，也不会使美国进口有显著的增加。
    其次，美国在今后三年内每年降低关税百分之五，是以换取其他国家相似的让步为条件的。就是说，美国关税税率是否降低要取决于其他国家是否也相应的减低关税。艾森豪威尔在今年一月的国情咨文中就说：“我们必须逐渐减少贸易方面的某些关税障碍。当然，在采取这种行动的同时，其他国家也应当同样降低贸易壁垒……”
    还应该指出的是：美国国会新通过的减税法案不但没有取消“互惠贸易协定法”中的所谓“例外条款”，相反，还扩大了“例外条款”运用的范围。例如，如果降低关税使某一种进口商品“威胁”到美国国内的工业，从而产生削弱“国家安全”的作用的话，美国总统就有权用提高关税或进口定额的方式来限制进口。五月间，“纽约时报”透露说，在援用由于“国家安全”而限制进口的条款“已经有这样的谅解，就是总统将尽量利用此项权力”。把原有的“互惠贸易协定法”下的“例外条款”扩大的另一个例子是：在同一厂商生产多种产品的情况下，如果进口商品对某一种产品带来“损害”或存在有这种“威胁”时，即使该厂商全面的利润仍有增加，也可单独对“威胁”其某一种产品的进口商品要求重新提高关税。
    减税法案在国会通过以后，美国参议院就把进口硬板的关税增加约一倍。瑞典、芬兰、加拿大驻美大使向美国国务院提出了抗议。
    新减税法案并且规定，减税税率依据的日期定为一九五五年一月一日。同时对在今年一月一日没有签订相互减低关税协定的国家不能援用减税的规定。这一点对日本来说是特别不利。因为日本和美国进行相互降低关税的谈判和完成是在一月一日以后。日本报纸的评论说，美国一方面企图阻止日本和它的邻国的贸易，一方面却不肯减低美国对日本货的关税壁垒。由日本私商组成的日本关税协会曾指出日美之间的不公平交易的情况说：当差不多所有卖给美国的日本商品被征收着百分之三十到七十的关税的时候，大部分日本购买的美国商品只被征收着百分之五到十五的关税。
    美国的合众社在报道关于艾森豪威尔签署授予他减低关税的权力的法案的消息时，指出：“这个法律中所包括的有一些条款，将使美国工业比这个已经有二十一年历史的计划实施以来的任何时候，都要容易向总统提出提高关税以保护他们不受损害的要求”。
    显而易见，美国并没有改变它一贯的损人利己的关税政策。所谓新税法，也仍然是服务于美国垄断资本的利益的。美国通讯社宣扬这个措施是“自由世界”反对“共产主义”的一个关键性措施，其目的只不过是为了转移人们对美国减低关税的真实意义的注意罢了。
