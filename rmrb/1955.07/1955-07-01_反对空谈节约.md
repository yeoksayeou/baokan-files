To do any job well, you need both determination and method, neither of which is dispensable. To transform the call for comprehensive thrift and overcoming all waste into the practical actions of the millions of masses and into a lasting system, this is even more the case. Having only determination, loudly proclaiming the importance of thrift, but failing to come up with concrete methods, or although proposing some thrift methods, yet lacking the determination to carry them out, so that after the event, waste remains as before – all of this is empty talk of thrift.

In order to resolutely and thoroughly implement strict thrift, the Party Central Committee and the State Council recently reiterated that comprehensive thrift is a fundamental method and long-term task of socialist construction, and put forward a series of measures for practicing thrift in all aspects. Conscientiously implementing the spirit of these instructions and various specific measures can strengthen the determination to be thrifty and increase the methods of being thrifty. According to the regulations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, in terms of capital construction, it is required to greatly reduce construction and installation costs in the last three years of the Five-Year Plan. In addition to reducing construction and installation costs by about 10 percent this year, it is also required to save another 10 to 15 percent of investment in non-productive construction in the second half of this year on this basis. In terms of production, transportation, and commodity circulation, efforts should be made to reduce industrial costs by 7.5 percent, transportation costs by 3.7 percent, and commercial circulation costs by 14 percent in the second half of this year. Control targets and methods have also been stipulated for streamlining the staff of institutions and the rent for public housing, public furniture, water, and electricity. These specific regulations are extremely important. With these regulations, it is easy to check and overcome all wasteful phenomena, and easy to mobilize the broad masses of workers and people across the country to supervise and fight against all behaviors that violate the principle of thrift.

However, in order to realize the regulations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, all work departments and institutions must also deeply study the waste in all aspects and links of their own units and the reasons for it, formulate thrift methods for their own units according to the regulations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and mobilize all personnel in their own units to fight for increasing production and practicing thrift, overcoming waste, and improving work. This includes a series of vivid political work, complex calculations, and meticulous organizational work. Only by doing this work well can thrift truly achieve results. Otherwise, if only the requirements of the central government are conveyed, general appeals are made, or superficial gestures are made, none of them can achieve the purpose of thrift.

However, not everyone understands this principle. Until recently, the phenomenon of empty talk about thrift was still quite prevalent in some regions and some enterprises. If this phenomenon was already intolerable in the past, then after the Party Central Committee and the State Council recently put forward various specific measures for thrift, it will be even more intolerable in the future. All departments and regions must expose and eliminate the phenomenon of empty talk about thrift. This is an important condition for ensuring the victory of the anti-waste struggle.

The joint instructions on "Opposing Waste and Launching a Comprehensive Thrift Movement" issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation and its Political Department on June 14 is an example of this kind of empty talk about thrift. In this nearly two-thousand-word instruction, no thrift methods or specific targets were mentioned. Only in the last less than two hundred words, a few "general requirements" were put forward: "In capital construction, we should ensure quality, meet urgent needs, and use funds reasonably; in production and transportation, we should tap potential, improve transportation quality, and reduce transportation costs; in affiliated industries, we should ensure repair quality and overcome rework waste; in the use of organizational structure and manpower, we should streamline institutions, reduce levels, enrich production personnel, determine staffing quotas, and use manpower reasonably." Here, which of these truly proposes thrift methods that are "meeting urgent needs" in Jiangxi's transportation industry? How should the employees of Jiangxi's transportation industry actually implement this instruction? Therefore, although they also expressed that "we must resolutely oppose waste in all aspects" and "quickly form a high tide of anti-waste in the department from top to bottom and inside to outside," it can be expected that if they do not quickly change this generalized leadership method, the anti-waste struggle will only become empty talk.

In some enterprises, workers have already proposed thrift methods, but they do not receive the support of enterprise leaders, and some thrift initiatives are even suppressed; or although the enterprise administration has formulated a thrift plan, it lacks the determination to implement it; as a result, whether it is a thrift initiative or a thrift plan, they all come to nothing, and no results are achieved. For example, in the forging and riveting workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, the raw material management system is extremely chaotic. Each work section and each group accumulates a lot of materials and has its own small warehouse. When defective products appear in production, they are thrown away, and new raw materials are taken from the "small warehouse" to redo them. Although this workshop has many defective products, they used the above method to fraudulently obtain the title of model workshop. Zhang Yi, the workshop material clerk, fought against this behavior and suggested to Yang Weijin, the workshop director, to clean up and eliminate the "small warehouses." However, his suggestion was consistently opposed and suppressed by Yang Weijin. Good methods cannot be realized, and the evil spirit of waste and deception continues to prevail. This phenomenon was only exposed and corrected recently. Another example is that all factories and mines in Shijiazhuang City recently formulated thrift plans. According to the recent calculations of forty-three state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, more than 6.24 million yuan can be saved annually. Many factories and mines in Shijiazhuang City have also implemented thrift plans very well. However, there are still individual factories and mines that, at the beginning of the anti-waste struggle, thought that everything would be fine after the plan was formulated, and did not resolutely implement the thrift plan. As a result, before the plan was formulated, the waste in these factories and mines was very serious, and after the plan was formulated, waste continued to develop. The workers criticized the leaders of these factories and mines, saying, "Thrift is a gust of wind," "Three days of heat," which is completely appropriate.

Why do the above-mentioned phenomena occur? This is because many people still do not understand the importance of thrift, let alone understand that thrift is a regular task. Some people think that production and work are very busy and cannot take care of thrift, so they make general appeals and deal with it briefly and then it is over. Some people think that increasing production and practicing thrift has been done every year, and this year will just be another "gust of wind" that will pass, so after formulating a few plans hastily, they go to be busy with other things. They do not understand that the thrift system is an important method to increase socialist accumulation and correctly use the accumulated funds, and an important method to promote the saving of social labor, obtain the best results with the least consumption, and develop socialist production. The view that opposes thrift to production and other work is completely wrong. As for the increase in production and thrift in the past few years, it has indeed achieved a lot of achievements, but compared with the requirements of building a socialist cause, it is far from enough. In the future, the phenomenon of "a gust of wind" must be overcome, and comprehensive thrift must be made a regular system and a national movement. Only in this way can we overcome various difficulties, accumulate construction funds, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction. Only by truly realizing this point can we avoid falsification and poor implementation.

Practicing comprehensive thrift and overcoming all waste is a regular and long-term struggle that must be implemented by all departments and all organizations. Leading cadres at all levels must, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, combined with the actual situation of their own departments and regions, put forward specific thrift methods and quickly implement them into all links, and avoid empty talk.

### 反对空谈节约

　　反对空谈节约
    要做好任何一项工作，都需要有决心和有办法，两者不可缺一。要把厉行全面节约、克服一切浪费的号召变成千百万群众的实际行动，成为持久的制度，更是如此。只有决心，口口声声高叫节约的重要，可是拿不出具体的办法，或者虽然提出了一些节约的办法，可是没有决心贯彻下去，事过境迁，浪费又依然如故，这都是空谈节约。
    为了坚决地、彻底地实行严格的节约，党中央和国务院最近再次指出了全面节约是社会主义建设的基本方法和长期的任务，并提出了在各方面厉行节约的一系列的措施。切实地贯彻这些指示的精神和各项具体措施，就可以坚定节约的决心，增加节约的办法。根据党中央和国务院的规定，在基本建设方面，要求在五年计划的后三年中，大大地降低建筑安装成本。今年除已降低建筑安装成本约百分之十以外，还要求在这个基础上将今年下半年的非生产性建设的投资再节约百分之十至百分之十五。在生产、交通运输和商品流转方面，要求争取在今年下半年中，降低工业成本百分之七点五，降低交通运输成本百分之三点七，降低商业流转费用百分之十四。在机关人员的精简和住用公共房屋、使用公共家具、水电等的租费方面，也都规定了控制指标和办法。这些具体规定是极其重要的。有了这些规定，就便于检查并克服一切浪费现象，便于动员广大职工群众和全国人民向一切违反节约原则的行为进行监督和斗争。
    但是，为要实现党中央和国务院的规定，各工作部门和事业机关还必须深入研究本单位各方面和各环节中的浪费情况及其原因，根据党中央和国务院的规定订出本单位的节约办法，将本单位所有的人员都动员起来为增产节约、克服浪费、改进工作而斗争。这里面包括一系列生动的政治工作，繁杂的计算工作和细致的组织工作，只有做好了这些工作，才能使节约真正收到成效。否则，如果只是传达了中央的要求，作了一般的号召，或者在表面上做做样子，就都不能达到节约的目的。
    可是，并不是所有的人都懂得了这个道理。就在不久以前，在若干地区和若干企业中，空谈节约还是相当流行的现象。这种现象如果说过去已经是不能容忍的，那么，在党中央和国务院最近提出了节约的各种具体措施以后，今后就是更加不能容忍的了。各部门和各地区必须揭发和消除空谈节约的现象，这是保证反浪费斗争胜利的重要条件。
    江西省交通厅和该厅政治处六月十四日发表的关于“反对浪费、开展全面节约运动”的联合指示，就是这种空谈节约的一个例子。在这个将近两千字的指示中，没有谈到任何节约的办法和具体的指标，只是在最后不到两百字的篇幅中，提了几点“总的要求”：“在基建上应保证质量，切合急需，合理使用资金；在生产上，运输生产中，应挖掘潜在力量，提高运输质量、降低运输成本，在附属工业中，应保证修理质量、克服返工浪费；在组织机构人力使用上，应做到精简机构，减少层次，充实生产人员，确定定员定额，合理使用人力。”这里，有哪一条是真正提出了江西省交通运输事业中“切合急需”的节约办法呢？江西省交通运输业的职工究竟应该如何来执行这个指示呢？因此，虽然他们也表示了“必须坚决反对各方面的浪费现象”，“在本部门内迅速形成上下内外一致地反浪费高潮”，但是可以预期得到，他们如果不迅速改变这种一般化的领导方法，反浪费斗争就只会变成空谈。
    在某些企业中，工人们已经提出了节约的办法，但是得不到企业领导人员的支持，某些节约的创议甚至遭到压制；或者虽然企业行政方面已经制定了节约计划，但是没有贯彻执行的决心；结果，无论是节约的创议也好，节约的计划也好，全都无疾而终，同样收不到任何成效。例如太原矿山机器厂锻铆车间，原材料管理制度极其混乱，每个工段、每个小组都积存很多材料，都有自己的小仓库。生产中出了废品，向外一扔，再从“小仓库”里拿出黑料重做。虽然这个车间的废品很多，但是它们却用上面的办法骗取了生产模范车间的称号。车间材料员张毅对这种行为曾进行了斗争，并向车间主任杨维晋建议清理和取消“小仓库”。可是他的建议始终遭到杨维晋的反对和压制。好的办法不能实现，浪费和欺骗的邪气就继续占着上风。这种现象一直到最近才被揭发并得到纠正。又如石家庄市所有的厂矿，不久前都订了节约计划，根据国营和地方国营四十三个厂矿最近的计算，全年可以节约六百二十四万多元。石家庄市的很多厂矿，执行节约计划也都很好。但是，那里也仍然有个别厂矿在反浪费斗争之初，曾经以为计划订出以后就万事大吉，没有坚决地把节约计划贯彻下去。结果，订计划以前，这些厂矿的浪费很严重，而订计划以后，浪费仍然继续在发展着。工人们批评这些厂矿的领导人员们说：“节约一阵风”，“三天热”，这是完全恰当的。
    为什么会产生上述的各种现象呢？这是由于很多人还不了解节约的重要意义，更不了解节约是一项经常的任务。有的人认为生产和工作都很忙，顾不及搞节约，因而泛泛地号召一通，应付一番以后就算了。有的人认为增产节约年年都搞，今年也不过“一阵风”就过去了，因而草率地订出几条计划以后，又去忙其他的事去了。他们不了解节约制度是增加社会主义积累和正确利用积累起来的资金的重要方法，是促进社会劳动的节省、以最少的消耗取得最好的成果、发展社会主义生产的重要方法。那种把节约同生产和其它工作对立起来的看法，是完全错误的。至于过去几年的增产节约，的确收到了不少的成就，但是和建设社会主义事业的要求相比，就是非常不够的了。今后必须克服“一阵风”的现象，使全面节约成为经常的制度和全民的运动。只有这样，才能克服各种困难，积聚建设资金，保证社会主义建设的顺利进行。也只有真正认识到这一点，才能够避免弄虚作假和贯彻不力的情况。
    厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费，这是一切部门一切组织所必须贯彻的一个经常的长期的斗争。各级领导工作人员必须根据党中央和国务院的要求，结合本部门本地区的实际情况，提出具体的节约办法，迅速贯彻到各个环节中去，切忌空谈。
