    The City of Youth - Warsaw on the Eve of the World Youth Festival
    By Our Correspondent Feng Zhidan
    The bi-annual joyous festival for youth around the world is about to begin. On the eve of the Fifth World Youth Festival, hundreds of millions of young hearts around the world are longing for this city of youth – Warsaw.
    From July 31st to August 14th, approximately 30,000 youth representatives from about 114 countries will gather here for peace and friendship. The youth of all humanity will converge here.
    Warsaw, this is a symbol of peace overcoming death, of humanity's creative labor overcoming the madness of war's destruction. During World War II, the Hitler bandits turned almost the entire Warsaw into ruins. But the heroic Warsaw rose from the ruins. Since the Polish people became the true masters of their country eleven years ago, she has been changing her appearance every day, becoming younger and more beautiful with each passing day. Since I entered Poland with the Chinese youth delegation, I have heard many times the Polish people proudly citing the reconstruction of Warsaw. Every Pole will tell you that they rebuilt their beloved Syrenka (the Warsaw city emblem - Mermaid), rebuilt the bronze statues of their respected Mickiewicz and Copernicus, rebuilt the old town from the Middle Ages that they admire, and they also rebuilt new residential areas, schools and factories on the execution grounds of the Hitler executioners. They turned the rubble piles on the banks of the Vistula River into many tree-lined gardens.... They will especially proudly tell you that in the center of Warsaw, the majestic building of the Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin towers into the clouds, radiating immortal brilliance for the Polish people.
    These days, Warsaw seems particularly young and beautiful. The beautiful Vistula River flows quietly. Beautiful music is transmitted from both banks, as if the moving Syrenka is also singing for the festival. The newly built magnificent stadium lies on the river bank, which is a huge project built by the people for the festival. This stadium can accommodate more than 70,000 people. During the construction process, a total of 2 million cubic meters of earth were excavated, 13 kilometers of water pipes were laid, and the surrounding green area covers 27 hectares. Such a huge project was completed in less than a year. In Warsaw alone, 80,000 people voluntarily participated in the voluntary labor of building the stadium. The opening ceremony of the festival and the friendship competition of athletes from various countries will be held here. In addition, thousands of loudspeakers and spotlights have been installed in the streets. The whole city is full of colorful flags, and there are slogans in various languages ​​welcoming the festival everywhere on the streets, such as "Long live peace and friendship!"
  "Peace has no borders!" and so on. At the Warsaw Central Railway Station, there is such a slogan: "Polish youth sincerely pay tribute to the peace envoys of the world!" The shop windows are decorated with flowers and patterns made up of national flags. On the streets, you can already see new buses from brotherly countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Germany, which are dedicated to the festival. Countless tents have been set up in the suburbs to prepare for the camping of 140,000 young people from all over Poland who will participate in the festival. Open-air stages have been set up in more than 20 squares such as Stalin Square and Constitution Square. Every evening, groups of young people sing and dance in these squares. In the evening, when I strolled through the streets of Warsaw, I deeply felt that the hearts of Warsaw's young people contained fiery emotions. The day before yesterday, in Dzerzhinsky Square, a Warsaw youth band was playing folk music on an open-air stage. I met a young cement worker, Royda, in the crowd. He had participated in the construction of the stadium. Royda proudly said: "I participated in the construction of the rostrum of the stadium. I feel honored because the stadium we built with our own hands will become a place for young people from all over the world to gather for peace and friendship."
    The people and youth of Warsaw are working hard to receive delegations from various countries before the festival. Young workers and students from 130 of the largest factories and universities in Warsaw are participating in these tasks. Young workers at the Warsaw Automobile Factory are preparing various gifts for the Soviet delegation, and young workers at the "Kasprzchak" radio factory are working to receive the Italian delegation. In order to agree with the Italian youth to carry out the get-together and enhance the friendship between the youth of Poland and Italy, the preparatory committee of the festival in this factory also printed a "Polish-Italian Dictionary" among the young workers. Young workers are learning Italian songs and dances. Young men and women at the Ursus Tractor Factory are busy for the Swedish delegation. Young worker Barol said: "When we come into contact with Swedish youth, we want them to understand our peaceful labor and understand that we produce tractors for the needs of the people every day in our factory."
    Polish youth launched a labor competition throughout the country to welcome the festival. Two million young people participated in the competition for the honor of Warsaw and for peace and friendship. Many factories overfulfilled their production plans. Many factories elected the most advanced workers to come to Warsaw. For example, the Bobrek Steel Plant in Stalinogród elected 26 advanced workers to participate in the festival. Sports and art competitions were also held throughout Poland to select the best programs to come to Warsaw. Thousands of Polish youths are now heading towards Warsaw from all over the country by bicycle or on foot.
    The day of the festival is coming. Youth representatives from every corner of the earth, from all walks of life and with different ideologies and beliefs, are heading towards Warsaw from the sky, the sea and the land. The entire Chinese delegation has arrived and held the first get-together with the Polish youth of the Sino-Polish Shipping Company. Then the Indian delegation arrived, the Japanese delegation arrived, the Brazilian delegation arrived, and the representatives of Australia and New Zealand arrived... These days, Warsaw is busy welcoming guests from all over the world. Although the youth of Warsaw are strangers to the newcomers and their language is difficult to understand, "peace and friendship" quickly became a language that everyone understands, whether at the station, the airport or on the street. These guests have brought the wishes of the youth of their countries for peace and friendship, as well as many of the best folk dances and excellent music from their countries. The culture and art of the world will blossom in Warsaw.
    During these days, the European Peace Youth Relay Race is advancing towards Warsaw in six routes. Young athletes will traverse many European countries, run to Warsaw, bring the message of peace to the festival, and bring the torch of peace to this city of youth.
    On the eve of the festival, congratulatory letters and telegrams from famous peace fighters, scientists, actors, artists, athletes, etc. from various countries were sent to Warsaw. They paid tribute to the festival and to Warsaw. They represent the kind people of the world and wish the festival a brilliant achievement. Turkish poet Hikmet and Bulgarian composer Bezhkov wrote a "Song of Peace and Friendship" for the festival. The poet's song will spread from Warsaw to the world, and the seeds of peace and friendship will be sown from Warsaw to the world. (July 29th in Warsaw)

    青春的城——世界青年联欢节前夕的华沙
    本报记者　冯之丹
    两年一次的全世界青年欢乐的节日就要开幕了。在第五届联欢节前夕，全世界亿万颗青年的心向往着这座青春的城市——华沙。
    从七月三十一日到八月十四日，将有约计一百一十四个国家的三万多个青年代表为了和平和友谊在这里聚会。全人类的青春的队伍将要在这里会师。
    华沙，这是和平战胜死亡，人类创造性的劳动战胜疯狂的战争破坏的象征。二次世界大战期间希特勒匪徒几乎把整个华沙变为废墟。但是英雄的华沙从废墟中站起来了。自从十一年前波兰人民成为自己国家真正的主人的时候起，她每天都在改变着自己的面貌，一天比一天更加年青，更加美丽。当我随着中国青年代表团走进波兰国境时起，许多次地听到波兰人以重建华沙而引为自豪。每一个波兰人将会告诉你，他们重建了他们所心爱的苏林娜（华沙城的城徽——美人鱼），重建了他们所崇敬的密茨凯维支和哥白尼的青铜像，重建了他们所赞美的中世纪的旧城，他们还在希特勒刽子手的刑场上重建了新的住宅区、学校和工厂。他们把维斯杜拉河岸上的瓦砾堆变成了许多绿树成荫的花园……。他们更会特别自豪地告诉你，在华沙市的中心，斯大林文化宫的雄伟建筑物高耸入云，为波兰人民发射着不灭的光辉。
    这些天里，华沙显得格外地年青和漂亮了。美丽的维斯杜拉河静静地流着。两岸传送着美妙的音乐，彷佛是动人的苏林娜也在为联欢节而歌唱。河畔躺着新落成的宏伟的运动场，这是人民为联欢节而建筑的巨大工程。这个运动场能容纳七万多人，在建筑过程中，共挖土两百万立方公尺，敷设的水管长达十三公里，周围的绿化面积有二十七公顷。这样巨大的工程在不到一年的时间内就完成了，仅仅在华沙就有八万人志愿地参加建筑运动场的义务劳动。联欢节的开幕式和各国运动员的友谊竞赛将在这里举行。除此以外，街头已安装了数千个播音器和聚光灯。全城彩旗招展，街道上到处都有迎接联欢节的各种语言的标语，如“和平与友谊万岁！”
  “和平没有界线！”等等。在华沙的火车总站，有这样的标语：“波兰青年衷心地向全世界的和平使者致敬！”在商店的橱窗里装饰着用各国国旗构成的花朵和图案。大街上已可以看到为联欢节专用的来自苏、捷、匈、德兄弟国家的崭新的公共汽车。在郊区已搭起无数帐篷，准备给波兰各地来参加联欢节的十四万青年露营。在斯大林广场、宪法广场等二十多个广场上，已搭起了露天舞台。每天傍晚在这些广场上有成群的年青人载歌载舞。傍晚，当我在华沙街头漫步时，我深深地感到华沙的年青人的心里蕴藏着火热的感情。前两天在捷尔任斯基广场上，一个华沙的青年乐队正在露天舞台上演奏着民间乐曲。我在人群中遇到了年青的水泥工人罗伊达，他曾参加了运动场的建设工程。罗伊达自傲地说：“我参加了运动场主席台的建筑。我感到光荣，因为我们亲手建筑起来的运动场将成为全世界青年、为了和平与友谊而欢聚的地方。”
    华沙人民和青年在联欢节前正在为接待各国代表团进行着紧张的工作。在华沙一百三十个最大的工厂和高等学校的青年工人和学生参加着这些工作。华沙汽车工厂青年工人为苏联代表团准备着各种礼品，“卡斯勃查克”无线电工厂的青年工人为接待意大利代表团而工作着。这个工厂的联欢节筹备委员会为了同意大利青年进行联欢，增进波意两国青年的友谊，还在青年工人中印发了一本“波意小辞典”。青年工人们学习着意大利的歌曲和舞蹈。乌尔苏斯拖拉机工厂的青年男女在为瑞典代表团而忙碌着。青年工人巴罗尔说：“在我们和瑞典青年接触时，我们要使他们了解我们的和平劳动，了解我们每天为了人民的需要而生产着拖拉机的工厂。”
    波兰青年在全国范围内为迎接联欢节而展开了劳动竞赛。二百万青年为了华沙的荣誉，为了和平与友谊，参加了竞赛。许多工厂超额完成了生产计划。许多工厂选举最先进的工作者到华沙来。如斯大林诺格罗德的波勃列克钢厂就选举了二十六个先进工人来参加联欢节。波兰全国各地还举行了体育和文艺竞赛，选拔最优秀的节目到华沙来。成千上万的波兰青年现在正骑着自行车或徒步从各地向着华沙进发。
    联欢节的日子来临了。来自全地球的各个角落、各个阶层有着不同思想信仰的青年代表，从天空、海洋和陆地向着华沙行进。中国代表团已经全部到达了，并且和中波航运公司的波兰青年举行过第一次联欢会。接着印度代表团到了，日本代表团到了，巴西代表团到了，澳大利亚、新西兰的代表到了……这几天，华沙正忙着迎接来自各国的客人。华沙青年对于初来的客人们虽然是陌生的，他们的语言是难懂的，但是无论在车站、机场或街道上，“和平与友谊”很快地成为大家都懂得的语言。这些客人都带来了本国青年要求和平与友谊的愿望，也带来了自己祖国的许多最好的民间舞蹈和出色的音乐。世界人类的文化和艺术，将在华沙百花齐放。
    在这些日子里，欧洲的和平青年接力赛跑正分六路向着华沙前进。年青的运动员们将要纵横地穿越过欧洲许多国家，奔向华沙，把和平的讯息带给联欢节，把和平的火把带给这青春的城。
    联欢节前夕，各国著名和平战士、科学家、演员、艺术家、运动员等的祝贺函电，纷纷地向华沙发来。他们向联欢节致敬，向华沙致敬。他们代表全世界善良的人民，预祝联欢节获得光辉的成就。土耳其诗人希克梅特和保加利亚作曲家贝士可夫为联欢节写下了一首“和平与友谊之歌”。诗人的歌声将要从华沙传遍全世界，和平与友谊的种子也将要从华沙撒播到全世界。（七月二十九日于华沙）
