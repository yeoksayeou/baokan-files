Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th—According to TASS, Moscow, 4th: Ivannova, Deputy Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, published an article in "Pravda" on the upcoming World Mothers' Congress.

The article said that the convening of the World Mothers' Congress allows mothers of different races, nationalities, social classes, political views, and religious beliefs to gather together to discuss and decide how they should act to protect their children and families from the threat of war, and from the suffering that war preparations bring to ordinary people. The proposal to convene a World Mothers' Congress to protect children, oppose war, strive for disarmament and international friendship has received extremely wide response and support from millions of mothers. The International Preparatory Committee of the Congress constantly receives telegrams from various women's organizations, well-known women activists, social figures, politicians, working women, etc. from all over the world, hoping that the Congress will be successful and declaring their support for the Congress. Twenty different international organizations have agreed to the proposal to convene the Congress, of which thirteen organizations have stated that they wish to send their representatives or observers to attend the Congress.

The article pointed out that seventy-six countries are actively preparing to participate in the Congress. National Mothers' Congresses have already been held in Brazil, Japan, Tunisia, West Germany, Israel, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries. Mother's Days against the danger of atomic war and against war have been held in France, Italy, Finland and other countries. Women's organizations in Kenya, Iran, Iraq, Colombia, South Africa, and Central America, under extremely difficult conditions of suppression and persecution, informed the majority of women of the decision to convene the Congress, explained the purpose of the Congress to them, and prepared to send delegations to attend the Congress.

Ivanova said that according to the wishes expressed by women's organizations and mothers in various places, it was decided to include a report entitled "Mothers Who Create Life Are Ready to Protect Life" in the agenda of the World Mothers' Congress. The mothers attending the Congress will exchange opinions based on this report.

Ivanova concluded by saying that the World Mothers' Congress is a new and important contribution by mothers to the common cause of the people of all countries to strive to safeguard and consolidate world peace.
