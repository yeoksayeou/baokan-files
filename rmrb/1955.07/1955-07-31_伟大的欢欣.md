    Great Rejoicing
    By our newspaper's collective reporters
    The six hundred million people of our country, who are vigorously advancing along the socialist road, will never forget this memorable day, July 30, 1955. On this day, thunderous applause constantly resounded in the ancient Beijing Huai Ren Hall. White-haired old men and twenty-year-old youths alike were full of vigor and vitality. Many major proposals, such as our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and the comprehensive plan for controlling the Yellow River's flood damage and developing its water resources, were unanimously adopted by the Second Session of the National People's Congress amidst thunderous applause.
    For the sake of transforming a poor and weak China into a prosperous and strong China, transforming a backward agricultural China into an advanced industrial China, and transforming a semi-colonial, disaster-ridden China into an independent, happy, and socialist China, countless patriots fought valiantly and selflessly, one after another. Today, this most noble and greatest ideal is about to be transformed into a brilliant reality in our hands through several five-year plans. The solemn resolution on the first Five-Year Plan is a major step in realizing this noble and great ideal. The resolution calls this five-year plan "a program of decisive significance for the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of the general task of the transition period," and points out that "the implementation of this plan will lay a good preliminary foundation for our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, thereby promoting the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people." This is entirely in line with our people's assessment of this great plan. In the representatives' simple language, this plan is to create a peaceful and happy life for the people of the whole country and our future generations, and to completely change the fate of our country and people. The storm-like applause that erupted when the meeting adopted this plan and lasted for a long time was a reflection of the high enthusiasm of the people of the whole country in wholeheartedly supporting this plan.
    When the representatives were discussing this plan, the elderly Professor Chen Yuan said that he now truly felt the poverty of vocabulary and felt that there were no appropriate words to express his joy. This feeling was common. He called the Five-Year Plan a "great work," a "great work that could not be compared to even if one searched through the Twenty-Four Histories, the collections of great politicians of past dynasties, and the compilations of statecraft." The writer Ba Jin compared the Five-Year Plan to "poetry in numbers"; Jin Shuliang, the president of the Northeast Institute of Technology, said that "every number in this plan radiates brilliant light"; Pei Aqian, a representative of the Nu River Lisu ethnic group, said that he "did not want to grow old," and that he "must personally participate in this great construction and live that happy and beautiful life"... This feeling is common. If a person lives among the people and not among those exploiters and parasites who spend their days pursuing petty and humble personal pleasures, if the interests he cares about are the interests of the people and not the interests of a few declining exploiters and parasites, then he will naturally experience this feeling of excitement and encouragement.
    The representatives of workers and peasants, the representatives of those who have endured exploitation and humiliation for so many years, can only stand up straight with their heads held high after liberation and live a truly human life. Of course, they are infinitely joyful and feel that they have never lived with such hope and confidence as they do today; even those in the business community who have patriotic enthusiasm and have had the idea of "saving the country through industry" cannot help but feel excited and encouraged today. Guo Dihuo, a representative of the Shanghai business community, said when talking about the development history of their Wing On Textile Factory that after this factory was founded in 1921, it developed to more than 200,000 spindles before liberation. On the surface, it seems that it was possible to develop national industry even during the reactionary rule; but what was the actual situation? He said: "Looking back at the history of development, it is not like that at all. Some of our factories were bought from fellow industries that had failed in their operations." This means that it was not a real development of the entire national economy and industry. What was the reason? Guo Dihuo said that the reason was that imperialism controlled our country's economic lifeline, and the reactionary rulers only destroyed the national industry and did not protect it.
    "The establishment and demise of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant left me with only a painful historical memory." This sentence spoken by Sun Dehe, who is engaged in steel smelting, at the conference reflects the fate of industry in old China and also reflects the universal sorrow of people engaged in industry in old China. Jin Shuliang gave a specific explanation of this: "The Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant was tightly bound by Japanese imperialism through loans and supervision of finances, so that it could not produce steel for a long time and could only mine iron ore for Japanese imperialism to use." "The Hankou Yangtze Machine Manufacturing Company, which was attached to an iron smelting plant,... could not survive and was finally seized by Japanese imperialism with all its machinery and equipment by means of mortgage loans, and then dismantled and transported away."
    How can people who have experienced and tasted this kind of pain not be excited and encouraged when they see the leapfrog progress in industrial construction in the years after liberation and the industrial prospects shown by the Five-Year Plan?
    The dark old era has passed forever, never to return, and the beautiful socialist prospects appear on the horizon, welcoming the morning sun. Although our enemies—the imperialists and their running dogs—are raising their voices and shouting, cursing us, and scolding us, asserting that we cannot do this or that; however, history will heavily slap their faces as it has done in the past. Our people have the strength to overthrow reactionary rulers at home and abroad, and they also have the strength to create a new life for themselves. The Yangtze River Bridge, which the reactionary government shouted about for forty years without seeing a shadow of, is now under active construction and will be open to traffic in 1958; the Hanshui Railway Bridge, which is a component of the Yangtze River Bridge, was opened to traffic in 1954; our country only produced hundreds of thousands of tons of steel each year before liberation; by the end of the Five-Year Plan, it will increase to 4.12 million tons. Taking the Yumen Oilfield as an example, the oil production in 1954 alone was more than all the wells drilled in the ten years of the Kuomintang era. Many wells that were scrapped before liberation have now been repaired and are producing oil. Many machine equipment, automobiles, tractors, etc., that our country could not manufacture itself in the past will be produced in large quantities. The Yellow River, which has been the greatest trouble for the Chinese people for thousands of years, many people have dreamed of conquering it, but it has always been just a dream; but now, we are going to make it obediently listen to us and serve hundreds of millions of people.
    What could be more exciting and encouraging than this? What plan can make people feel more happy and fortunate to strive for its realization?
    In order to realize this great plan, the representatives, representing the will of the people of the whole country, made solemn statements at the conference. The representatives of the workers came up with many ways to increase production and practice economy, improve quality, and reduce costs; the representatives of the rural areas guaranteed to increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials according to the national plan; the representatives of the business community guaranteed to accept the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the working masses, and actively take the road of state capitalism; the representatives of the scientific community were determined to continuously strengthen scientific research and serve the Five-Year Plan; the representatives of the education community guaranteed to complete the plan for training construction talents; the representatives of the military were determined to strengthen the modernization and regularization of national defense and defend the great motherland and the great socialist cause...
    When the solemn national anthem was played, all the representatives in the hall stood up in awe. The representatives were about to go to their solemn fighting posts. They cheered loudly, cheered for the great Mao Zedong, cheered for all the national leaders, and it lasted for a long time.
    The meeting closed. The goals of struggle pointed out by the meeting for the people of the whole country will encourage the people of the whole country to move forward more enthusiastically and vigorously along the socialist road.

    伟大的欢欣
    本报记者集体采写
    正在沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进的我国六万万人民，将永远不会忘记一九五五年七月三十日这个可纪念的日子。在这个日子，古老的北京怀仁堂里不断地轰响着雷一般的掌声，须发斑白的老年人和二十岁的青年人一样精神奕奕，充溢着生命力，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划以及根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划等许多重大的议案，由全国人民代表大会第二次会议全体一致地在雷动的掌声中通过了。
    为着把贫弱的中国变成富强的中国，把落后的农业的中国变成先进的工业的中国，把半殖民地的灾难深重的中国变成独立的、幸福的和社会主义的中国，多少志士曾经奋不顾身、前仆后继地战斗过。如今，这个最崇高最伟大的理想就要在我们手里经过几个五年计划而变成灿烂的现实了。关于第一个五年计划的庄严的决议，就是实现这种崇高伟大的理想的重大步骤。决议把这个五年计划称为
  “全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领”，指出“这个计划的实现，将为我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业奠定良好的初步的基础，从而促进国家的富强和人民的幸福”，这是完全合乎我国人民对于这一伟大计划的估价的。用代表们朴素的语言来说，这个计划就是为全国人民和我们的子孙万代创造和平幸福生活的计划，就是彻底改变我们国家和人民的命运的计划。会议在通过这一计划时轰响起暴风雨般的掌声，久久地停不下来，就是全国人民竭诚拥护这一计划的高度热情的反映。
    在代表们讨论这个计划的时候，年迈的陈垣教授说他现在才真正感觉到语汇的贫乏，感觉到没有恰当的词句可以表达他的欢欣，这种心情是共同的。他把五年计划称为“伟大的著作”，称为“翻遍二十四史、历代大政治家文集、以及经世文编等等都没有可与比拟的伟大著作”。作家巴金把五年计划比作“数字的诗”；东北工学院院长靳树梁说这个计划的“每个数字都放射着灿烂光芒”；怒江傈僳族的裴阿欠代表说他“不愿衰老”，“一定要亲手参加这个伟大的建设，还要亲身过那幸福美好的日子”……。这种心情，都是共同的。一个人如果是生活在人民群众之中，而不是生活在那些整日追求渺小的卑微的个人享乐的剥削者寄生者之中，如果他所关心的利益是人民群众的利益，而不是少数没落的剥削者寄生者的利益，那末，他都会很自然地体会到这种兴奋鼓舞的心情的。
    工人和农民的代表，那些多少年来忍受剥削和凌辱的人们的代表，只有在解放以后才能挺着胸膛站了起来，过真正的人的生活，他们当然是无限欢欣，觉得自己从来没有像今天这样充满希望充满信心地生活过；就是工商界中那些有着爱国热情和有过“实业救国”思想的人们，今天也不能不感到兴奋和鼓舞。上海工商界代表郭棣活在谈到他们的永安纱厂的发展历史时说，这个纱厂在一九二一年创办起来以后，到解放以前，一共发展到二十多万锭，表面上看去在反动统治时期也是可以发展民族工业的；实际上呢？他说：“回想一下发展的历史，完全不是这末回事。我们有些厂，是向经营失败的同业买进的。”这就是说，那并不是整个国民经济和工业的真正发展。什么原因呢？郭棣活说，原因是帝国主义掌握了我国的经济命脉，反动统治者对民族工业只有摧残，没有保护。
    “汉阳钢铁厂的建立与消灭，留给我的只是一个悲痛的历史回忆。”从事钢铁冶炼工作的孙德和在大会上发言时所说的这句话，反映了旧中国工业的命运，也反映了旧中国从事工业的人们的普遍的悲哀。靳树梁对此作了具体的说明：“汉阳钢铁厂被日本帝国主义用放款和监督财务的手段紧紧地束缚住，使它长期不能生产钢铁而只能采铁矿以供日本帝国主义利用。”“附设有炼铁厂的汉口扬子机器制造公司，……不能自存，终于被日本帝国主义用抵押放款的方式夺取了它的全部机器设备，并将其拆除运走。”
    经历过和尝受过这种痛苦的人们，看到解放后几年中在工业建设上的飞跃进展和五年计划所展示的工业的前景，他们怎能不兴奋鼓舞呢？
    阴暗的旧时代永远地过去了，一去不复返了，社会主义的美丽的远景迎着朝日出现在地平线上。尽管我们的敌人——帝国主义和它的走狗们在提高嗓子大叫，诅咒我们，辱骂我们，断言我们这也干不成那也干不成；但是，历史将像过去一样沉重地打他们的嘴巴。我们的人民既有力量把国内外反动统治者打翻，就同样有力量为自己创造新的生活。反动政府喊叫了四十年而没有见到影子的长江大桥，现在已经在积极修建，一九五八年就要通车了；作为长江大桥的组成部分的汉水铁路桥一九五四年已经通车；我国在解放以前每年只生产几十万吨钢铁；到五年计划的末期将增长至四百一十二万吨。石油生产，以玉门油矿为例，仅一九五四年一年打的井，就比国民党时代十几年打的井还多。解放前许多报废了的井，现在也都修好出油了。我国过去不能自制的许多机器设备、汽车、拖拉机，等等，都将大量生产。几千年来一直是中国人民最大的苦恼的黄河，多少人曾经梦想过要制服它，但始终只是梦想；但是现在，我们就要叫它乖乖地听我们的话，为亿万的人民服务了。
    有什么事情比这更使人兴奋鼓舞呢？有什么计划能够使人感觉到为它的实现而奋斗是更快乐、更幸福的呢？
    为了实现这个伟大的计划，代表们代表着全国人民的意志，在大会上作了庄严的表示。工人的代表们在增产节约、提高质量、降低成本方面想出了许多办法；农村的代表们保证要按国家计划增产粮食和工业原料；工商界的代表们保证要接受国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，积极走国家资本主义的道路；科学界的代表们决心不断地加强科学研究工作、为五年计划服务；教育界的代表们保证完成培养建设人材的计划；部队的代表们决心加强现代化正规化的国防建设，保卫伟大的祖国和伟大的社会主义事业……
    在庄严的国歌奏起来的时候，全场的代表都肃然起立。代表们就要走向他们庄严的战斗岗位去了。他们高声欢呼，向着伟大的毛泽东欢呼，向着所有的国家领导人员们欢呼，久久不息。
    会议闭幕了。会议所指给全国人民的奋斗目标，将鼓舞着全国人民更加激越奋发地沿着社会主义的道路向前迈进。
