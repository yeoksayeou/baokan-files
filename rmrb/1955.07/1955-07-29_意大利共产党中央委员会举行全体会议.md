Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 28th: According to a TASS report from Rome, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party recently held a plenary session. The Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, Longo, delivered a report at the meeting.

The meeting discussed Longo's report. Those who spoke during the discussion included the Secretary of the Italian Communist Party Secretariat, Pajetta, and Amendola, among others. Their speeches emphasized that the Party's work should adapt to the international situation and that it is necessary to constantly seek new forms of propaganda and work among the masses. They also pointed out that the struggle to improve living standards and defend the trade union rights of the working people should be closely linked to the struggle for the Party's main goals. At present, signs of dissatisfaction and crisis are becoming increasingly serious within the ranks of the ruling parties.

The General Secretary of the Party, Togliatti, spoke at the final meeting. He talked about the connection between the masses who support socialism and Catholics.

Togliatti pointed out that the opportunity for the forces of the people to unite is now ripe.

Togliatti pointed out that in establishing contact with Catholic believers, it is necessary not only to be extremely good at approaching them collectively and individually, but also to have the ability to persuade them, while also conducting criticism.

Togliatti said that the trends of the Christian Democratic Party should be exposed in front of the members of the Christian Democratic Party, because the purpose of this party is to consolidate reactionary forces and preserve the rule of the old conservatives in Italy.

Togliatti concluded by saying: It is not enough for contact with Catholics to be limited to seeking temporary unified action on individual economic or political issues; this discussion must revolve around the main issues and aim at reaching a common agreement.

    意大利共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社罗马消息：意大利共产党中央委员会最近举行了全体会议。共产党副总书记隆哥在会上作了报告。
    会议讨论了隆哥的报告。在讨论中发言的有意共书记处书记巴叶塔和阿门多拉等人。他们的发言强调指出，党的工作应当适应国际形势，必须经常寻找在群众中进行宣传和工作的新的形式。他们还指出，争取改善生活水平、维护劳动人民工会权利的斗争应当同争取党的主要目的的斗争紧密地联系起来。在目前，在各执政党的队伍中，不满和危机的迹象已愈来愈严重了。
    党的总书记陶里亚蒂在最后一次会议上发了言。他谈到拥护社会主义的群众和天主教徒之间的联系问题。
    陶里亚蒂指出，现在，人民大众的力量团结起来的机会成熟了。
    陶里亚蒂指出，在同天主教信徒建立联系的时候，不仅要极度善于集体地和个别地和他们接近，而且还要求有能力说服他们，同时还应进行批评。
    陶里亚蒂说，应当在天主教民主党党员面前揭露天主教民主党的动向，因为这个党的目的是巩固反动势力，保存旧的保守派在意大利的统治。
    陶里亚蒂最后说：同天主教徒的联系如果仅仅限于就个别的经济或政治问题谋求暂时的统一行动是不够的，必须使这种讨论围绕着主要的问题进行，并以达成共同协议为目的。
