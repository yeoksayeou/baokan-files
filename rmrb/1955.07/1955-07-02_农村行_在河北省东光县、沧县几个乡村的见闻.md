Rural Travels
—Observations in Several Villages in Dongguang County and Cang County, Hebei Province
Xiong Kewu, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

　　According to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Representative Wang Weizhou and I set off on June 8 to inspect work in Cang County District, Hebei Province. In addition to listening to reports from responsible persons of the Commissioner's Office and the County People's Committee, we also went to two townships in Dongguang County and one township and one village in Cang County, convened symposiums with rural staff, labor models, heads of agricultural production cooperatives, heads of mutual aid teams, and grain-deficient households, and directly contacted local farmers. We gained a preliminary impression of the significant changes that have taken place in rural areas in recent years, as well as the actual problems that exist today.

　　Cang County District is a purely flat area with many depressions and alkaline lands. All fourteen counties in the district have historically been threatened by spring droughts and autumn floods. I visited this area before liberation, and it has been over twenty years in the blink of an eye. At that time, the lives of the farmers were very hard, eating chaff and vegetables, and barely having clothes to wear. That was the case in normal years, and it was even worse in disaster years. The farmers of Li Caishen Township in Dongguang County said with great emotion: "1930 was a disaster year. Many people starved to death at that time. Out of the sixty households in the whole village, more than forty went out to escape the famine." After liberation, the land reform was implemented, and mutual aid and cooperation were developed. With the help of the state and the efforts of the farmers, agricultural production has developed considerably, and the lives of the farmers have also improved. The lives of farmers in economic crop areas have improved faster than those in agricultural areas. Although there was one drought and three floods in the six years from 1949 to 1954, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we finally overcame the disasters and survived the famine. In the past, grain production in this area was not enough to meet the consumption of the area, but in the future, we will strive to achieve self-sufficiency. From their personal experience, the farmers deeply realized that all this happiness was given to them by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They expressed their inner gratitude in simple language: "Eating pancakes in the morning, noodles at noon, and soup in the evening, when we eat, we think of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party."

　　Before I went to the countryside, I also heard people say that "the unified purchase and sale has deviations, there is not enough food in the countryside, and the lives of the farmers are very hard," and so on. What is the actual situation? According to my field inspection in the countryside, the farmers support the policy of unified purchase and sale. Many farmers have further realized the benefits of stable grain prices and guaranteed supply to the farmers after the implementation of unified purchase and sale by comparing the period before and after the implementation of unified purchase and sale, and believe that this is in line with their fundamental interests. In March and April this year, a situation of "tension" in grain supply did occur universally throughout the district. Almost all rural staff and all the masses were asking for grain, people were uneasy, and production enthusiasm was low. After rectifying the unified sales work, on the basis of in-depth ideological education, mobilizing the masses, and clarifying the bottom line, using methods such as recalling and calculating accounts, the situation of tension has been eased through mass evaluation and reasonable adjustment, coupled with the implementation of the "three fixes" policy. All places that have undergone rectification of unified sales have guaranteed the supply of grain-deficient households, while the total supply has generally decreased. In the 111 villages in Dongguang County where the rectification of the unified sales work has ended, the farmers have reduced the supply of grain by 370,000 jin, supplemented the grain-deficient households with 170,000 jin, and still have a surplus of 200,000 jin. Li Caishen Township, which we inspected, is a medium-sized township in terms of its size. In this rectification of the unified sales work, it also reduced the supply of grain by 7,925 jin, supplemented the grain-deficient households with 3,165 jin, and recovered 4,760 jin. At the same time, because ideological and practical problems have been reasonably resolved, the masses are at ease, and the issuance of the "three fixes" policy has greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production. The old farmer He Deyuan did not weed when planting spring wheat and was negative; now he has a lot of energy, and the cornfield has been weeded three times. The masses are very satisfied and believe that "now we have a number, we must produce well."

　　The experience of rectifying the unified sales work centrally shows that not all farmers who demand grain are grain-deficient households; surplus grain households and non-grain-deficient households are afraid of "revealing their wealth" and try to "strive" to become grain-deficient households and have the idea of "storing grain for famine," and also "attack as defense" and demand supply, even more urgently than the truly grain-deficient households. Bad elements took the opportunity to incite sabotage, increasing the "tension." For example, Li, the wife of rich peasant Li Lanfang in Houzheng Village, Fourth District of Dongguang County, had more than 1,000 jin of surplus grain, but she cried and shouted, shouting on the street, "The state does not supply grain, people are going to starve to death." At the same time, this also shows that our work does have shortcomings. The main shortcomings are that some staff members have not fully implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale, and the unified purchase is tight, and the unified sale is relatively sloppy. As a result, the supply is unreasonable, the task distribution is too light or too heavy, those who should not be supplied are supplied, and some who should be supplied less are supplied more, and there are also a few who should be supplied but have not been supplied or supplied less. The phenomenon of wasting grain in the early stage of supply was not corrected in time, or even ignored, which also increased the amount of supply that could be saved. Some rural staff members have no idea in their minds, and cannot distinguish between truly grain-deficient and those who say they are deficient; or they are afraid of offending people, are irresponsible, and adopt a "responsive" attitude, only reaching out to the state for grain, and putting the burden of solving the grain problem entirely on the state. As a result, the grain supply is even more "tense." Zhang Qingyi, the head of Sanlizhuang Township in Dongguang County, said at the symposium: "At that time, we had no idea. The village cadres asked us to supply 10,000 jin, so we asked the above to supply 8,000 jin. In fact, not only did we not need to supply enough, but we could also save more than 600 jin."

　　Regarding the issue of the amount of grain retained, according to the understanding gained from the symposiums in Sanlizhuang Township and Li Caishen Township in Dongguang County and Huangpu Township in Cang County, it is possible to solve the problem by supplying an average of 300 to 350 jin per person per year; even if individual households with many laborers and few children have more difficulties, they can also be adjusted and resolved within this average amount within the scope of the entire township or village. Regarding the supply ratio of staple food and miscellaneous grains, in the places we have been to, the general opinion is that staple food accounts for 70% and miscellaneous grains (mainly soybeans and black beans) account for 30%, and the masses have no major opinions. However, in some areas, such as Sanlizhuang Township, staple food accounts for 30% to 40%, and black beans account for 60% to 70%. The proportion of miscellaneous grains is large, and the masses have opinions. This is certainly due to objective reasons, such as the floods last year, and the rush to plant beans after the water receded, resulting in a large production of beans, so more should be sold. However, it is possible to make appropriate adjustments from the perspective of the entire district and even the entire province, and appropriately increase the supply ratio of staple food in certain areas. In addition, I feel that there are too few pigs raised in rural areas. Sanlizhuang Township has 540 households and only raises 18 pigs, which means that an average of 30 households raise one pig. According to farmers, this is related to the small amount of grain retained. For example, Li Caishen Township only retains an average of 60 jin of grain per pig per year. Because there are few pigs raised, there is less fertilizer, and production is also affected. This issue should attract our attention.

　　In the countryside, there is another situation that has left a deep impression on me, and that is the issue of social security. People often say: "Now in the countryside, people really do not pick up things left on the road, and do not close their doors at night. They are not afraid of having their donkeys stolen even if they sleep with the doors of their yards open." Of course, after destroying the pseudo-bao-jia system, after democratic construction, especially after the nationwide, vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the open and semi-open counter-revolutionaries floating on the social surface have been severely打击, and social security has been further consolidated. However, with the increasing acuteness of the class struggle, the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have not weakened, and some are still very rampant, but their methods are more concealed, clever, and vicious.

　　At present, the major hazards to rural social security and the more prominent activities are:

　　(1) Reactionary secret societies, especially Yiguandao. The activities of these elements are relatively secretive. Some build dark rooms and caves, some use business as a cover, and some pretend to be active and infiltrate agricultural production cooperatives. The case of Yiguandao point preachers Zhuang Shuhui and Zhou Wanlong, etc., which was cracked by Dongguang County in August 1954, used business as a cover and operated in six counties and one city. There were 63 point preachers, 45 altar masters, and 4 "three talents" participating in the activities. Another example is Ji Wanchang, a Yiguandao member in Ji Village, Fifth District of Dongguang County, who infiltrated the cooperative and stole the position of head of the cooperative, and secretly killed five of the nine livestock in the cooperative.

　　(2) Current sabotage by landlords, rich peasants, pseudo-military officers, pseudo-officials, habitual thieves, etc. According to the person in charge of Cang County, the occurrence of criminal cases has been on the rise in various places. Dongguang County's statistics are: 95 cases occurred in 1953, increasing to 113 cases in 1954, and 50 cases from January to May 1955. However, the rate of solving cases is very low, generally 60%, and some are only about 50%. This has caused dissatisfaction among the masses. These current sabotage activities are mostly aimed at the central work, public property, our staff members, and activists, spreading rumors, stealing, arson, murder, and even breaking into agricultural cooperatives to carry out sudden attacks or wait for opportunities to sabotage. Of the 50 criminal cases that occurred in Dongguang County from January to May 1955, 11 belonged to theft and sabotage of public property, accounting for 22%. In the Third District, four landlords and rich peasants were found to have infiltrated our agricultural cooperatives as accountants, deliberately messing up the accounts; Li Fuhai, a traitor in Li Xizhuang, killed three members of farmer Li Fugui's family in August 1954 (two were saved after emergency treatment). During the "tense" grain supply this year, bad elements were also found spreading rumors and sabotaging.

　　(3) In addition, in some places recently, counter-revolutionaries who were previously thought to have fled and whose whereabouts were unknown and counter-revolutionaries who falsely reported their deaths have been found in caves and hidden walls. Most of these elements are extremely guilty and have great popular indignation. Dongguang County recently discovered four people, some of whom had been hiding in caves for five years.

　　The above situation shows that the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have shown a trend of rising again. These elements have already caused great damage to our socialist cause. Some people think that after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have disappeared or are not enough to worry about; some people are paralyzed because the enemy's activities are very hidden and they cannot find the enemy; others are first paralyzed and take the enemy lightly, and then panic when something happens, do not conduct investigations and understand the situation, and do not distinguish the nature of the crime, and generally demand severe punishment. Therefore, while continuing to strengthen the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, it is also very necessary to regularly conduct education to improve the vigilance of cadres and the masses.

　　I left Cang County District on June 14 and returned to Beijing. Although this inspection lasted only one week, I heard a lot, saw a lot, and learned a lot. I deeply feel that the Communist Party and the People's Government's various policies towards the countryside are completely correct. The grassroots staff members are generally hardworking, simple, and dedicated. Although there are still some shortcomings in our work, they are all shortcomings in the process of progress. Relying on the supervision of the people, promoting the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, we will definitely be able to overcome them. Our cause cannot be destroyed by any enemy; we will surely be victorious!

　　农村行
　　——在河北省东光县、沧县几个乡村的见闻
　　全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员　熊克武
    根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定，我于六月八日和王维舟代表一道出发到河北省沧县专区视察工作。除了听取专署和县人民委员会负责人的汇报外，还到东光县的两个乡和沧县的一个乡、一个村，召集乡村工作人员、劳动模范、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长、缺粮户等开座谈会，同当地的农民直接接触。对于农村里几年来所发生的重大变化，以及今天存在的实际问题，有了一个初步的印象。
    沧县专区是纯平原区，洼地多，碱地多。全专区有十四个县历年遭受春旱秋涝的威胁。这一带地区，解放以前我曾经到过，一转眼已经二十来年了。那时候，农民们的生活很苦，吃糠咽菜，衣不蔽体；平常年景是如此，碰上灾年，就更不得了。东光县李财神乡的农民非常感慨地说：“一九三○年是灾年，那时饿死不少人，全村六十户，出外逃荒的就有四十多户。”解放以后，实行了土地改革，发展了互助合作，在国家的帮助和农民们努力之下，农业生产有了相当的发展，农民生活也随之上升，经济作物区农民生活比农产区农民生活提高得更快一些。虽然从一九四九年到一九五四年这六年中，发生过一次旱灾、三次涝灾，但在共产党和人民政府正确领导之下，终于战胜灾害，度过灾荒。过去本区粮食生产不敷本区消费，今后准备努力争取达到自给。农民们从其切身经验中，深深体会到：这一切幸福，都是共产党和毛主席给予的，他们用朴素的语言，表达了自己内心的感激：“早吃饼，午吃面，晚吃汤，吃饭就想起毛主席和共产党。”
    我在下乡之前，也曾听到有人说“统购统销有偏差，农村粮食不够吃，农民生活很苦”等等。实际情况究竟怎样呢？据我到农村实地视察，农民对统购统销政策是拥护的，很多农民从统购统销实行前后的对比中，进一步体会到统购统销后粮价稳定、保证供应对农民的好处，认为这符合他们根本的利益。在今年三、四月间，全专区确曾普遍地发生过粮食供应“紧张”的情况。几乎大部乡村工作人员和所有群众都在要求供应粮食，人心不安，生产情绪低落。经过整顿统销工作，在深入思想教育、发动群众、摸清底子的基础上，用回忆、算帐等办法，通过群众评议，进行合理调整，加上“三定”政策的贯彻，已使紧张情况和缓下来。凡是经过整顿统销的地方，都保证了缺粮户的供应，而总的供应量一般地说却减少了。东光县整顿统销工作已结束的一百一十一个村，农民共减少供应粮三十七万斤，补给缺粮户十七万斤，还节余二十万斤。我们视察过的李财神乡，按其大小来说是一个中等乡，在这次整顿统销工作中也减少供应粮七千九百二十五斤，补给缺粮户三千一百六十五斤，还收回四千七百六十斤。同时，由于思想问题和实际问题得到了合理解决，群众情绪安定，“三定”政策下达后，更大大地鼓励了农民的生产积极性。老农民何德元在种春麦时不除草，情绪消极；现在劲头很大，玉米地已经除了三遍草。群众都很满意，认为“现在有数了，要好好生产”。
    整顿统销工作的经验集中地说明：要求供应粮食的农民，不完全都是缺粮户；余粮户和不缺粮户为了怕“露富”，企图“争取”当缺粮户和有“储粮备荒”的思想，也“以攻为守”要求供应，甚至要求得比真正缺粮户还急。坏分子则乘机煽动破坏，增长了“紧张”情况。如东光县四区后郑村富农李兰芳的女人李氏有一千多斤余粮，还大哭大叫，在街上喊“国家不供应粮食，要饿死人了”。同时，这也说明我们的工作的确还有缺点。缺点主要是一些工作人员对于统购统销的政策的全面贯彻做得不够，统购抓得紧，统销较潦草。结果，供应不合理，任务分配畸轻畸重，不该供应的供应了，该少供应的供应多了，也有少数该供应而没有供应或供应少了的。对于供应早期浪费粮食的现象，没有及时纠正，甚至熟视无睹，也增加了可以节省的供应量。部分乡村工作人员心中无数，分不清真正缺粮和不缺说缺的界限；或者怕得罪人，不负责任，采取“有求必应”态度，只伸手向国家要粮，把解决粮食的担子全部放到国家身上。其结果，使粮食供应更加
  “紧张”。东光县三里庄乡乡长张庆义在座谈会上说：“当时我们没有底，村干部要我们供应万把斤，我们就向上面要求供应八千斤，其实不但不要供应就够，而且还可节余六百多斤。”
    留粮数额问题，根据在东光县三里庄乡、李财神乡和沧县黄铺乡的座谈了解，平均每人每年按三百斤至三百五十斤供应，是能够解决问题的；即使有个别劳动力多、小孩少的户比较困难，也可以从全乡或全村范围内，在这个平均数额内调整解决。主粮和杂粮的供应比例，我们到过的地方，一般是主粮百分之七十，杂粮（主要是黄豆、黑豆）百分之三十，群众意见不大。但有些地区，如三里庄乡，主粮占百分之三十至四十，黑豆占百分之六十至七十，杂粮的比例是大了，群众有意见。这固然有客观原因，如去年受了涝灾，水退后抢种豆类，豆子产得多，就要多销些。但从全专区乃至全省范围内加以适当调整，适当提高某些地区主粮的供应比例，是可以办得到的。另外，我感觉农村喂猪头数实在太少了，三里庄乡有五百四十户只喂十八头猪，即平均三十户才喂一头。据农民谈，这和留粮太少有关，如李财神乡平均每头猪每年只留粮六十斤就是例子。因喂猪少，肥料少，生产也受影响。这个问题，是应该引起我们注意的。
    在农村里，还有一种情况给我的印象很深，这就是社会治安问题。常听到人们说：“现在农村里真是路不拾遗，夜不闭户，敞开院门睡觉也不怕偷走毛驴了。”固然，经过摧毁伪保甲，经过民主建政，特别是经过全国性轰轰烈烈的镇压反革命运动，浮在社会面上的公开和半公开的反革命分子已经受到严重打击，社会治安已经进一步地巩固。但是，随着阶级斗争的日趋尖锐，反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动并没有减弱，有的还很嚣张，只是在方式上更为隐蔽、巧妙、毒辣罢了。
    目前对农村社会治安危害较大、活动比较突出的是：
      （一）反动会道门，特别是一贯道。这些分子的活动比较诡秘，有的建暗室、地洞，有的以行商做掩护，有的伪装积极打入农业生产合作社。东光县在一九五四年八月破获的一贯道点传师庄淑惠、周万隆等案，即以行商做掩护，活动于六个县一个市，参与活动的有点传师六十三名、坛主四十五名、“三才”四名。又如东光县五区姬庄一贯道分子姬万长，混入合作社窃取了社长职位，将社内九头牲口暗地害死五头。
    （二）地主、富农分子和伪军官、伪官吏、惯偷惯盗等的现行破坏。据沧县专署负责人谈，刑事案件的发生，各地都有上升趋势。东光县的统计是：一九五三年发生九十五起，一九五四年增至一百一十三起，一九五五年一至五月就有五十起。但破案率很低，一般是百分之六十，有的只百分之五十左右。这已引起群众不满。这些现行破坏，大都针对中心工作，针对公共财产，针对我工作人员和积极分子，造谣，盗窃，纵火，凶杀，甚至打进农业社，进行突然袭击或待机破坏。东光县一九五五年一至五月发生的刑事案件五十起中，属于盗窃破坏公共财产的有十一起，占百分之二十二。在三区发现地主、富农分子打进我农业社当会计，故意搞乱帐目的有四人；李习庄汉奸分子李福海在一九五四年八月杀害了农民李福贵一家三口（经急救活了二人）。今年粮食供应“紧张”时，同样发现有坏分子造谣破坏。
      （三）此外，有些地方最近从地洞、夹墙中发现了过去认为已经外逃、不明下落的反革命分子和假报死亡的反革命分子，这些分子多是罪大恶极民愤甚大的。东光县最近发现四名，其中有的已在洞里藏了五年。
    上述情况说明，反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动又有抬头的趋势，这些分子已经给我们的社会主义事业造成了莫大损害。有人以为经过镇压反革命运动，反革命分子和坏分子已经销声匿迹或不足为患了；有人因为敌人活动很隐蔽，发现不了敌人而麻痹起来；也有人先是麻痹轻敌，遇事则惊惶失措，不进行调查了解，不区别犯罪性质，一概要求严办。因此，在继续加强对反革命分子和坏分子的镇压的同时，经常地向干部和群众进行提高警惕性的教育，也是十分必要的。
    我于六月十四日离开沧县专区回到北京。这次视察虽然为时仅仅一个星期，但听到了许多，看到了许多，也学到了许多。我深深感到：共产党和人民政府对农村的各项方针政策是完全正确的。基层工作人员一般都是艰苦朴素、埋头苦干的。虽然在我们的工作中，还不免存在一些缺点，但都是进步过程中的缺点，依靠着人民群众的监督，发扬批评和自我批评精神，一定能够加以克服。我们的事业是任何敌人破坏不了的；我们一定能够胜利！
