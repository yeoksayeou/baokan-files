Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 22nd. The Soviet delegation submitted to the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference on the 21st a draft resolution on "Resolution of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference on Arms Reduction and Banning of Atomic Weapons," the full text of which is as follows:

    In order to ease tensions in international relations, strengthen mutual trust between countries, and eliminate the threat of a new war, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France consider it necessary to strive for the early conclusion of an international convention on arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    After exchanging views on the issue of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the heads of government of the four countries reached agreement on the following points:

    (1) The level of armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should be set at 1 million to 1.5 million each; the level of armed forces of the United Kingdom and France should be set at 650,000 each; the level set for China and other issues related to the Chinese armed forces should be considered with the participation of the People's Republic of China.

    The level of armed forces of all other countries shall not exceed 150,000 to 200,000, and shall be agreed upon at an appropriate international conference.

    (2) Measures to completely prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons should come into effect after the armed forces and conventional armaments have been reduced by 75 percent according to agreed-upon reduction amounts. The work of removing these weapons from the armaments of all countries and destroying them shall be completed in the process of reducing the final 25 percent of armaments according to agreed-upon reduction amounts. Thereafter, all atomic materials should only be used for peaceful purposes.

    (3) While beginning to take measures to reduce armaments and armed forces, and before the agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons comes into effect, the four major powers shall solemnly guarantee not to use nuclear weapons, considering nuclear weapons to be prohibited to them. Exceptions to this provision may be permitted if the Security Council makes corresponding resolutions for defense against aggression.

    (4) As one of the preliminary measures for implementing the plan for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons should guarantee to cease conducting tests of such weapons.

    (5) Effective international supervision should be established for the implementation of measures for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    (6) The heads of government of the four major powers have instructed the foreign ministers to strive to reach the necessary agreements on the unresolved issues concerning the aforementioned convention that will be considered in the United Nations Organization.

    At the same time, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France are determined to prohibit the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons—weapons of mass destruction—and to free the people of all countries from the threat of a devastating atomic war, and hereby solemnly declare:

    Before the conclusion of an international convention on arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France guarantee not to be the first to use atomic and hydrogen weapons against any country, and request all other countries to participate in this declaration.

    苏联代表团提出关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决议草案
    新华社日内瓦二十二日电　苏联代表团二十一日在四国政府首脑会议上提出“四国政府首脑会议关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决议”草案，全文如下：
    为了缓和国际关系中的紧张局势、加强国与国之间的相互信任和消除新战争的威胁，苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府首脑认为有必要为了早日缔结一项关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的国际公约而努力。
    四国政府首脑在就裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题交换了意见之后，对下列各点取得一致意见：
    （一）美国、苏联和中国的武装部队的水平应规定各为一百万到一百五十万人；英国和法国的武装部队的水平应规定各为六十五万人；为中国规定的水平以及与中国武装部队问题有关的其他问题应该在中华人民共和国参加之下加以考虑。
    所有其他国家的武装部队的水平不得超过十五万到二十万人，并且应在一次适当的国际会议上予以商定。
    （二）在武装部队和常规军备按照一致商定的裁减数额减少了百分之七十五以后，完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施就应该生效。从各国军备中去除这些武器并加以销毁的工作应在裁减一致商定的裁减数额的最后百分之二十五的军备的过程中完成。在此以后，所有的原子物质应只能用于和平目的。
    （三）在开始采取裁减军备和武装部队的措施的同时，在关于完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的协议生效以前，四大国应庄严保证不使用核子武器，认为核子武器对他们来说是被禁止的。如果为了对侵略进行防御，当安全理事会作出相应的决议的时候，可以允许对本条规定有例外。
    （四）作为执行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的计划的初步措施之一，拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家应保证停止进行这类武器的试验。
    （五）应对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的实行建立有效的国际监督。
    （六）四大国政府首脑已训令外长们努力对将在联合国组织中考虑的关于上述公约的尚未取得一致意见的问题达成必要的协议。
    同时，苏联、美国、英国和法国的政府首脑们决心禁止使用原子武器和氢武器——大规模杀人的武器——和使各国人民免除毁灭性的原子战争的威胁，兹庄严地宣布：
    在关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的国际公约缔结以前，苏联、美国、英国和法国保证不对任何国家首先使用原子武器和氢武器，并要求其他一切国家参加这个宣言。（附图片）
