The new Fengtai-Shacheng railway line officially opened to traffic on July 15th. This new railway section is a new component of the Beijing-Baotou Railway and is of great significance for increasing the transportation capacity of the Beijing-Baotou Railway and meeting the needs of socialist construction.

Before the construction of the Fengsha Line, trains departing from Beijing would travel through 40 to 50 kilometers of flat terrain, and after passing Nankou, they would enter the Yanshan Mountains, the remnants of the Taihang Mountains. Here, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and the roads are winding. The speed of the train began to slow down, and the locomotive had to work hard, often requiring two locomotives to pull it over the mountain peaks. The train had to pass through the famous Juyongguan Pass and the dangerous Badaling on the Great Wall, and it was not until after leaving Kangzhuang Station that this mountain section was considered to be over. Train drivers call this section the "Guangou Section," meaning that it is a difficult pass to climb. The "Guangou Section" limited the transportation capacity of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, and trains climbed slowly and carried less here.

Originally, as early as 1905, when engineer Zhan Tianyou presided over the construction of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway, he measured six comparison lines. Zhan Tianyou's most ideal route was to leave Beijing and enter the Western Hills, advancing along the mountain canyons on both sides of the Yongding River, which is the route that the Fengsha Line now takes. Although this route is relatively straight and has a smaller slope, which would be of inestimable benefit for long-term transportation, it would require the excavation of more tunnels and the construction of more bridges, making the project much more arduous. The corrupt Qing Dynasty was unwilling to spend more money to build the railway at that time, so Zhan Tianyou had to reluctantly design the route that he himself was not satisfied with, which was the "Guangou Section."

Nearly half a century has passed, and this Chinese most famous railway engineer's ideal can only become a reality in the new China led by the Communist Party today.

In the winter of 1952, the Ministry of Railways, according to the decision of the Party and the government, began to build the Fengsha Railway. This railway is the railway with the most complex geology and the highest tunnel density among the existing railways and those under construction in China. Its characteristics are: arduous engineering, complex technology, and large workload. Although the line is only 105 kilometers long, it has to traverse countless mountains. From Sanjiadian to Guanting, a distance of only 62 kilometers, 65 tunnels of various sizes have to be excavated, including nine tunnels with a length of more than one kilometer, the longest of which is 2.5 kilometers. The total length of these 65 tunnels accounts for 45% of the length of this section and a quarter of the total length of the line. On average, a train has to pass through 270 meters of tunnel for every kilometer it travels. In addition, it is necessary to cross the turbulent Yongding River eight times, and build a total of 270 bridges and culverts of various sizes in many mountain streams, with a total length of 7,875 meters. On average, there is one meter of bridge or culvert every 13 or 14 meters on the entire line. The total length of tunnels, bridges and other large buildings accounts for more than 30% of the total length of the line. In many places, the tunnels are connected to each other, and the bridges are connected to each other. Once out of the tunnel, you are on a bridge, and after crossing the bridge, you enter the tunnel again. The entire line also requires filling and excavation of 5.2 million cubic meters of earth and stone.

Despite the difficulty and arduousness of the project, it was overcome by the heroic and tenacious fighting will of the People's Liberation Army and the infinite wisdom of the working class who participated in the construction. In October 1952, when they first arrived at the construction site, the mountains were sparsely populated, and eating and living were very difficult. In order to prepare for construction, a transportation line had to be built first. At this time, the Yongding River had frozen over. In order to build a temporary bridge, Miao Zishan, the chief of staff of the engineering battalion, took the lead in jumping into the ice river to repair it. Squad leader and Communist Party members Lu Yongkui, Han Ailin, and soldier Deng Renli jumped into the water together. They persisted in the cold water for half an hour and did not go ashore until the wooden piles were firmly driven. A temporary bridge was built in just one day. Lacking tools, the soldiers used military picks to dig soil, tied stones with backpack ropes, and scooped sand with their hands and clothes. In this way, they built a transportation line along the Yongding River.

Excavating tunnels was the most difficult and arduous part of the entire project. They adopted methods such as learning while working and teaching each other to gradually become familiar with the business, master the technology, and gain construction experience. At first, the tunnel was excavated by first using a hammer and steel drill to make blast holes in the rock, and then putting explosives in to blast the stone. In this way, the pilot tunnel was first excavated, and then the excavation was expanded. Although these newly transferred soldiers were very courageous, they were not yet proficient in wielding the eight-pound hammer to strike the steel drill, and the blast holes were often chosen incorrectly. They could not complete the progress tasks assigned by their superiors, so they relied on increasing the number of people to complete the progress. After increasing the number of people, the work efficiency improved in the first few days. However, gradually this method of relying on a large number of people became unfeasible, because the working face inside the tunnel was narrow, and too many people interfered with each other, and the excavated debris could not be transported out. The pilot tunnel, two meters eight decimeters high and three meters five decimeters wide, required scaffolding to be built on the upper side for excavation, and the scaffolding had to be removed on the lower side. After blasting, the debris could not be taken out, which affected the continued progress forward. Foreman and Communist Party member Zhang Xianghe researched a double-layer, double-entry excavation method: first dig down from the upper layer, leaving a step underneath, and push the debris down to the step, so that the debris could be removed while making the holes and blasting. When hitting the upper layer, people stood on the steps, without having to build scaffolding. After the upper layer had advanced a certain distance, they would turn around and gradually remove the remaining steps. In this way, the upper and lower layers would be excavated simultaneously, and the work efficiency would be increased by one-half. The entire line of tunnel excavation universally adopted this experience, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. Later, a large number of pneumatic drills were transported to the construction site, and mechanized excavation began. The soldiers cheered and embraced them. However, the vibration of the pneumatic drill when it was running was very large, requiring six people to hold it. Later, as the technology gradually became proficient, only three people were needed to manage one pneumatic drill, and finally five people could manage two pneumatic drills, moving forward side by side and excavating at the same time. At first, each pneumatic drill could only advance five or six meters per day, but later it progressed to the point where two pneumatic drills could excavate sixty to seventy meters per day. When blasting, at first one blast could only blast about one cubic meter of stone, but later it could blast five to one hundred and twenty cubic meters of stone, and the highest was over one thousand five hundred cubic meters.

Many tunnels had very serious cave-ins. Tunnel No. 18, which was more than four li long, had six major cave-ins, some of which collapsed to a height of twenty-seven or eight meters and a length of eighteen meters. Many tunnels also had springs that gushed outwards, hindering the progress of the project. Tunnel No. 35 had five or six natural springs, and in severe cases, hundreds of tons of water would pour out per hour. Working in the tunnels, the water underfoot became a river. Some tunnels also had quicksand, with large boulders mixed in the sand. The workers worked diligently and ingeniously to overcome all difficulties and excavated the tunnels meter by meter.

Building bridges over the turbulent Yongding River was also an arduous task. In the spring, they had to fight against the ice floods, in the summer and autumn they had to prevent floods and rush to rescue, and in the winter they had to fight against wind, sand, water, and snow. They learned and implemented the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "thermos-style heat storage method" and other winter construction methods, and built many bridges.

In the two years and more since the construction of the Fengsha Railway, the workers and staff have put forward a total of 715 rationalization proposals, saving the country nearly 1.1 million yuan in wealth. Soldier Li Wuchang created a lifting scaffold, which solved the difficulties of high-altitude operations. Soldier Zhang Qianyu changed the hand-cranked centrifugal casting machine to an electric one, which greatly improved the efficiency of tile casting.

The completion of the Fengsha Railway half a year ahead of schedule was also the result of the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the active support of the people of the whole country. The railway was designed and constructed under the guidance of sophisticated Soviet technology. Problems such as the collapse of the famous Tunnel No. 18, the water outflow problem, and the winter construction problem of the foundation of Bridge No. 8 were all solved with the specific assistance of Soviet experts. During the tense construction period, tens of thousands of migrant workers participated in the road construction with carts and horses. In Huailai County, Hebei Province alone, more than 3,000 migrant workers participated in the road construction. The farmers along the line supported the road construction with the greatest effort.

The construction process of more than two years has been a process of workers fighting against floods, torrents, cave-ins, quicksand, cliffs, precipices, wind, sand, and severe cold. In the past two years, this young people's railway construction team has been trained and grown, and a total of 6,882 technicians in machinery, bridges, tunnels, civil engineering, and electrical work have been trained, as well as 3,162 business cadres. Now, the Fengsha Line is open to traffic. On this new line, the driving speed can be doubled compared to the "Guangou Section," and the transportation capacity can be tripled. The coal from Datong, the iron from Xuanhua and Baotou, the rice from the Wuyuan Hetao, the horses from Inner Mongolia, the furs and medicinal materials from the Northwest, and the natural salt from the Yikezhao League will no longer be limited by the transportation capacity of the "Guangou Section," and can be transported in large quantities to various places in the motherland that need them. Materials from all over the motherland supporting the economic construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can also be transported in large quantities through this line. More importantly, in the near future, after the opening of the international joint transportation between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, trains from the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic can pass through the Jier Line and the Beijing-Baotou Line, which is composed of the Fengsha Line, to reach China's capital, Beijing. Therefore, the opening of the Fengsha Railway also greatly facilitates economic and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe.

    伸展在丛山峻岭中的丰沙铁路
    王综
    丰台到沙城的新铁路线在七月十五日正式通车了。这段新的铁路是京包铁路新的组成部分，对提高京包铁路的运输能力，适应社会主义建设的需要有重要意义。
    丰沙线没有修建以前，火车从北京出发，经过四、五十公里的平坦地带，过了南口以后，就进入太行山余脉的燕山山脉。这里山高坡陡，道弯路曲。火车行驶的速度开始慢下来，机车要拚足了力气，并经常要用两台机车牵引，才能爬过一个一个的山峰。火车要经过万里长城上著名的居庸关和险峻的八达岭，一直到走出康庄车站以后，才算结束了这一段山路。火车司机们把这一段路程叫做“关沟段”，意思是说：这里是个关口难于攀登。“关沟段”限制了京包铁路的运输能力，火车在这里爬得慢、拉得少。
    本来，早在一九○五年，詹天佑工程师主持修筑京张铁路时，曾测量了六条比较线。詹天佑最理想的线路是出了北京进入西山，沿着永定河两旁的山峡前进，这就是现在丰沙线所走的线路。尽管这条线路比较直，坡度也小，对长期的运输有不可估量的好处，可是要开凿更多的隧道，架设更多的桥梁，工程要艰巨浩大得多。当时腐败的满清王朝是不肯多拿钱来修铁路的，詹天佑也只好委委曲曲地设计了他自己并不满意的走“关沟段”的那条路。
    近半个世纪的时间过去了，这位中国最有名的铁路工程师的理想，只有在今天共产党领导的新中国，才会成为现实。
    一九五二年冬天，铁道部根据党和政府的决定，开始修筑丰沙铁路。这条铁路是我国现有铁路和正在修筑的铁路中地质复杂、隧道密度最大的铁路，它的特点是：工程艰巨，技术复杂，工作量大。线路全长虽然仅仅一百零五公里，却要横穿无数个丛山峻岭。仅从三家店到官厅的六十二公里中，就要凿穿大小隧道六十五座，隧道长度在一公里以上的就有九座，最长的一座长达两公里半。这六十五座隧道的总长占这段线路长度的百分之四十五，占全线总长的四分之一。火车平均每行驶一公里就要穿过二百七十公尺隧道。此外，还要八次跨越水流湍急的永定河，并在许多山涧中间修建大小桥梁和涵洞共二百七十座，总长达七千八百七十五公尺，全线平均每十三、四公尺就有一公尺桥涵。隧道和桥梁等大型建筑物的总长占全线长度的十分之三以上，许多地方洞洞相连，桥洞相连，出了洞就是桥，过了桥又进洞。全线还要填挖土石五百二十万方。
    尽管工程这样困难艰巨，还是被参加筑路的人民解放军英勇顽强的战斗意志和工人阶级的无穷智慧克服了。一九五二年十月，他们初到工地，深山里人烟稀少，吃住都很困难。为了准备施工，先要修好一条运输便线。这时，永定河水已结成冰，为了修好便桥，工兵营的参谋长苗子山带头跳入冰河里抢修，班长、共产党员路永奎、韩爱林和战士邓仁立，一齐跳下水去，他们在冰冷的水里坚持了半小时，一直把木桩打稳才上岸。只一天就架好了一座便桥。缺乏工具，战士们就用军用镐挖土，用背包绳捆石头，用手和衣服捧砂子，就这样，他们沿着永定河修起了运输便线。
    开挖隧道是整个工程中最困难最艰巨的部分。他们采取边作边学、互教互学等办法，来逐渐熟悉业务，掌握技术，取得施工经验。起初，开挖隧道是先用锤和钢钎在山石上打出炮眼，然后把炸药放进去，放炮开石。这样来先凿通导洞，然后扩大开挖。这些刚转业的战士们尽管勇气很足，但是抡八磅锤打钢钎还不熟练，炮眼也常常选择得不对，完不成上级所给的进度任务，于是就靠增加人来完成进度。增加人以后，最初几天工作效率是提高了。可是，逐渐地这个拚人多的办法就行不通了，因为隧道里面工作面狭窄，人多了互相妨碍，开挖出来的石碴运不出来。导洞，两公尺八公寸高，三公尺五公寸宽，开挖上边要搭架子，开挖下边又得把架子拆掉，放完炮，碴出不去，影响继续向前挖进。工长、共产党员张向合研究出一种双层双进的开挖法：先从上层打下去，底下留个台阶，把打下来的石碴推到台下去，这样可以一边出碴一边打眼放炮。打上层的时候，人就站在台阶上，不用搭架子，等上层打进一定距离以后，再回头把留下的台阶渐次打掉，这样双层开挖上下并进，工作效率提高二分之一。全线的隧道开挖普遍吸取了这个经验，大大地加速了工程进度。后来，大批的风钻运到了工地，开始了机械化开挖。战士们欢呼地抱起了它。但是风钻开动起来震动力非常大，要六个人才能抱住。后来，技术逐渐熟练了，只用三个人管一个风钻，最后是五个人可以管理两个风钻，并肩前进，同时开挖。起初每个风钻每天只能进五、六公尺，后来进步到两个风钻每天能开挖六十到七十公尺。放炮，起初一炮只能炸开石头一立方公尺左右，到后来就能炸开五方到一百二十方石头，最高炸开过一千五百立方公尺。
    许多隧道塌方的现象非常严重。长达四华里多的十八号隧道有六处大塌方，有的塌了二十七、八公尺高，十八公尺长。许多隧道里还有向外冒水的泉眼，阻碍工程的进行。三十五号隧道里就有五、六个自然泉眼，情况严重的地方一小时要涌出百八十吨水。在隧道里工作，脚下的水流成了河。有些隧道里还有流砂，砂里夹着大孤石。工人们辛勤机智地克服了一切困难，一公尺一公尺地把隧道挖通。
    在水流湍急的永定河上修筑桥梁，同样是个艰苦的任务。春天要同凌汛作斗争，夏秋又要防洪抢险，冬天还要同风沙水雪搏斗。他们学习和贯彻了苏联“暖瓶式蓄热法”等冬季施工的先进经验，把许多桥梁修建起来。
    在修筑丰沙铁路的两年多以来，职工们共提出七百一十五件合理化建议，为国家节约了将近一百一十万元的财富。战士李武常创造了升降式脚手架，解决了高空作业的困难。战士张前煜改手摇离心浇铸机为电动式的，大大提高了铸瓦效率。
    丰沙铁路能提前半年修通，也是苏联专家的热诚帮助、全国人民积极支援的结果。这条铁路从设计到施工，都是在苏联精湛的技术指导下进行的。像著名的十八号隧道的塌方、出水问题、八号大桥基础的冬季施工问题，都是在苏联专家的具体帮助下得到解决的。在施工紧张时期，数万民工带着车马参加筑路，仅河北省怀来县参加筑路的民工就达三千多人。沿线农民以最大的力量支援了筑路。
    两年多以来的施工过程，是工人们向洪水、急流、塌方、流砂、悬岩、峭壁、风沙、严寒做斗争的过程。两年多以来，锻炼和成长了这一支年轻的人民铁路建设队伍，培养了机械、桥梁、隧道、土木建筑、电务等技术工人共六千八百八十二名，还培养了业务干部三千一百六十二名。现在，丰沙线通车了。在这条新的线路上，行车速度可以比“关沟段”提高两倍，运输能力可以提高三倍。大同的煤，宣化和包头的铁，五原河套的大米，内蒙古的骏马，西北的皮毛和药材，伊克昭盟的天然食盐都不再受“关沟段”运输能力的限制，可以大量地源源送到祖国需要的各个地方去。祖国各地支援内蒙古自治区经济建设的物资也可以通过这条线大量运去。更重要的是：在不久的将来，中、苏、蒙三国的国际联运开办以后，来自苏联和蒙古人民共和国的列车可以经过集二线和由丰沙线参加组成的京包线直达我国首都北京。因此，丰沙铁路的通车，也大大地便利了中国和苏联、蒙古以及东欧各人民民主国家在经济和文化上的交流。
