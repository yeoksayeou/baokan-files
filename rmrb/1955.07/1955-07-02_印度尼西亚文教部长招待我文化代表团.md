Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 1st July. On the evening of June 30th, in the "Proclamation Hall" where President Sukarno proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia ten years ago, the Indonesian Minister of Education and Culture, Yamin, held a grand banquet to host the Chinese Cultural Delegation.

    Among those present at the banquet were Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and his wife, Foreign Minister Sunarjo, Minister of National Welfare Abbas, Mayor of Jakarta Sudiro, and many other prominent figures from political and cultural circles, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Jakarta. Members of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association and members of the Indonesian art troupe who visited China last year also attended the banquet.

    The head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, Zheng Zhenduo, deputy head Zhou Erfu, and all members of the delegation received a warm welcome when they arrived at the magnificently decorated hall at 7:30 p.m. The Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, and personnel from the Chinese Embassy were also invited to attend the banquet.

    In his welcome speech, Minister Yamin said that Asia is the cradle of great civilizations, but cultural relations between Asian and African countries have been interrupted for many centuries under the iron heel of colonial forces. He said that Indonesia and China established cultural relations very early, but as a result of colonial rule, this friendly relationship was also hindered. Yamin said that in the past two years, in a free atmosphere, prominent figures from Indonesia have visited China, and prominent figures from China have visited Indonesia. Yamin happily recounted the recent visit of Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo to China and the earlier visit of Premier Zhou Enlai to Indonesia. Yamin emphasized: "This visit of the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China to Indonesia is in line with the Bandung Conference's decision to strengthen cultural relations between Asian and African countries."

    In his speech, Zheng Zhenduo first expressed his gratitude to the Indonesian government and people. He pointed out that this visit, following the historic Bandung Conference and the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and Indonesia, is of great significance. He said: "Undoubtedly, this friendly visit between the two countries will play a major role in promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the two countries, thereby contributing to the continuous strengthening of friendly relations between the two countries. This friendship is an important force in the cause of defending the sacred Asian and world peace."

    The banquet continued in a harmonious atmosphere until late at night.

  雅明部长在致欢迎词中说，亚洲是伟大文明的摇篮，但是，亚非国家之间的文化关系却在殖民势力的铁蹄下中断了好多世纪。他说，印度尼西亚和中国在很早的时候就建立了文化关系，但是由于殖民统治的结果，这种友好关系也受到了阻碍。雅明说，过去两年中，在自由的气氛中，印度尼西亚的著名人士访问了中国，中国的著名人士访问了印度尼西亚。雅明愉快地追述了最近阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理访问中国和前些时候周恩来总理访问印度尼西亚的情景。雅明强调指出：“中华人民共和国文化代表团这次访问印度尼西亚，是符合于万隆会议关于加强亚非国家文化关系的决定的。”
    郑振铎团长在致词中首先向印度尼西亚政府和人民表示感谢。他指出，在具有历史意义的万隆会议和中国和印度尼西亚两国总理发表联合声明之后的这次访问是具有重大意义的。他说：“无疑地，两国之间的这种友好访问将在促进两国文化交流和相互了解方面起重大作用，从而对不断加强两国友好关系方面有所贡献。这种友谊是保卫神圣的亚洲和世界和平的事业的重要力量。”
    宴会在融洽的气氛中继续到深夜。
