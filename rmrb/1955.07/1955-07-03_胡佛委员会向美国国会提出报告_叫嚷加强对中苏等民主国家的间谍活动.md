Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Washington: The Hoover Commission, currently studying the reorganization of U.S. government agencies, submitted a report to the U.S. Congress on June 28, advocating for the strengthening of subversive and espionage activities by the U.S. intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), against the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries.

    The report stated bluntly that the main targets in the U.S. "espionage field" are the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the peace and democratic camp, and that the CIA should "concentrate greater efforts on collecting intelligence from these primary targets of the United States." The report said that the CIA had not obtained "sufficient intelligence" about countries in the peace and democratic camp in the past. Therefore, the report suggests "reorganizing" the CIA to strengthen work in this area.

    The report shamelessly stated that the U.S. military needs intelligence about Soviet strength and that "every conceivable and practical effort must be made to obtain it." The report said that this requires "risking certain anticipated political and diplomatic dangers and fully utilizing technical capabilities." The report advocated that officials of the U.S. State Department should cooperate more closely with the CIA's work to "excavate" intelligence from other countries.

    According to U.S. news agency reports, the Hoover Commission report put forward a series of specific recommendations to strengthen the work of the CIA and other intelligence agencies (such as the Intelligence Division of the Department of the Army). Most of these recommendations have not been published but were submitted to Eisenhower along with a "top secret report" on the current activities of U.S. spies in other countries.

    Before the Hoover Commission submitted its report, a special group appointed by Eisenhower to study the work of the CIA also submitted a report. This report expressed sadness that the United States had failed to collect "certain intelligence" from countries in the peace and democratic camp in the past. The report advocated that the U.S. government take measures, especially through diplomatic methods, to collect intelligence. The report acknowledged that diplomatic methods and methods used to collect "intelligence in the Cold War" are "incompatible." However, the report openly stated that "diplomacy itself is not an end," and only "intelligence material" is extremely important.

### 胡佛委员会向美国国会提出报告　叫嚷加强对中苏等民主国家的间谍活动

　　胡佛委员会向美国国会提出报告
　　叫嚷加强对中苏等民主国家的间谍活动
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：目前正在研究美国政府机构的改组工作的胡佛委员会六月二十八日向美国国会提出一个报告，主张加强美国特务机关中央情报局对苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的颠覆活动和间谍活动。
    报告赤裸裸地说，在美国“间谍活动领域内的”主要目标是苏联、中国和和平民主阵营其他国家，中央情报局应该“集中更大的力量从美国的这些主要目标收集情报”。报告说，中央情报局过去还没有搞到关于和平民主阵营国家“足够的情报”，因此，报告建议“改组”中央情报局，以加强这方面的工作。
    报告里无耻地说，美国军队需要关于苏联力量的情报，“必须用尽一切可以设想的和实际的努力来获得它”。报告说，在这方面，需要“冒某些意料中的政治上和外交上的危险以及充分利用技术方面的能力”。报告主张美国国务院的官员应当更加密切地配合中央情报局的工作，来“挖掘”其他国家的情报。
    美国通讯社的消息说，胡佛委员会报告里提出了一系列加强中央情报局及其他情报机关（如陆军部的情报处）工作的具体建议，这些建议大部分都没有公布，而连同一个关于美国间谍目前在其他国家进行活动的情况的“绝密报告”提交给了艾森豪威尔。
    在胡佛委员会提出它的报告以前，一个由艾森豪威尔任命的研究中央情报局工作的特别小组也提出了一个报告。这个报告对美国过去未能收集到和平民主阵营国家“某些情报”表示伤心。报告主张美国政府采取措施，特别是通过外交的方法来收集情报。这个报告承认，外交的方法和用来收集“冷战中的情报”的方法是“不相容的”。但是报告公然说，“外交本身并不是一个目的”，只有“情报材料”才是极为重要的。
