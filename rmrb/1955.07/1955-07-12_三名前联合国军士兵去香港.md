Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Three former UN soldiers, American Griggs, Bell, and Kowart, left Guangdong Province's Shenzhen this afternoon. Chen Qi, a staff member of the Chinese Red Cross, escorted them from Guangzhou to Shenzhen. After the Shenzhen Customs of the People's Republic of China completed the routine inspection, they were handed over to Mrs. Strachey, a staff member of the Hong Kong branch of the British Red Cross, who had come to the border to receive them. The handover was completed at 1:05 PM. The three American soldiers were then led away by Mrs. Strachey, and after her entourage checked their names one by one, they left Shenzhen for Hong Kong at 1:13 PM.

These three American soldiers were all former Korean War prisoners of war who refused repatriation and applied to reside in China through the Chinese Red Cross in February 1954.

In June of this year, they applied to leave China and were approved by the relevant Chinese authorities.

Two former UN soldiers of Belgian nationality, De Vrian and Verdingen, who applied to leave China at the same time as them, are awaiting contact from the Indian Red Cross and relevant parties. They will leave China as soon as the contact is made.

    三名前联合国军士兵去香港
    新华社十日讯　前联合国军美籍士兵格里格斯、贝尔和科华特三人已在今天下午从广东省深圳出境。中国红十字会工作人员陈岐把他们从广州送到深圳，经中华人民共和国深圳海关按例检查后，交给英国红十字会香港分会派到边境接待他们的工作人员司特拉西夫人。双方在下午一时零五分将交接事项办理完毕。这三名美籍士兵即由司特拉西夫人领走，并由她的随员逐一点名后，在一时十三分离深圳去香港。
    这三名美籍士兵都是一九五四年二月经由中国红十字会申请来中国居住的拒绝遣返的朝鲜战争中的战俘。
    今年六月，他们提出离开中国的申请，并获得中国有关方面的批准。
    跟他们同时申请离开中国的两名前联合国军比利时籍士兵德夫里安和弗尔迪涅正在等待印度红十字会和有关方面的接洽。一等到接洽妥当，他们也即将离开中国。
