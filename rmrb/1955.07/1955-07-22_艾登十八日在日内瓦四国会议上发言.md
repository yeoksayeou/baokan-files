Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 19th. British Prime Minister Eden spoke at the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference on the 18th.

    In his speech, Eden said: The Four-Power Heads of Government Conference is unique in history because it is being held in a situation unprecedented in human experience. The scientific and technological discoveries of our time have made it possible for us to obtain unprecedented resources. But if the major powers go to war, it will inevitably bring about complete destruction.

    Eden went on to say that these are harsh facts, and perhaps we can finally strive for lasting peace by realizing these facts. This fact, which deters people from taking warlike actions, raises a warning, but these facts alone cannot solve international problems or remove the differences that exist between us. The Four-Power Heads of Government are meeting here to make progress in resolving these problems and differences. At this meeting, these issues must be dealt with mainly within Europe, the main one being the issue of German reunification.

    Eden said that as long as Germany is divided, Europe is divided. There will be neither trust nor security on this continent until German unity is restored.

    Eden said that it is now necessary to calmly study how much we can move forward from the apparently fixed attitudes taken by the two major powers on the German issue at the Berlin Conference. The reason for the failure of the Berlin Conference was that one of the countries believed that a unified, rearmed Germany with the right to choose to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would pose a greater threat to its security. I do not intend to argue whether these fears are justified. There have been many things in the past decade that could cause suspicion and panic. These have been expressed in huge arms programs. In order to deal with these issues in a broader scope, we have all agreed to work through the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We welcome the great progress recently made by the Commission and the great degree of common thinking now reflected in the various proposals presented by the Western countries and the proposals recently submitted to us by the Soviet government. All these discussions will continue, but the immediate need is to make a practical start. The pressing question is how to start the process of easing tensions and eliminating suspicion and fear. There is also the practical question of how we can jointly come up with and implement effective supervision of armaments and troops.

    Eden said that the reunification of Germany itself would not increase or decrease any threat to European security that people may believe already exists. Everything will depend on the conditions of reunification. Therefore, I now intend to suggest that we consider some interrelated proposals aimed at accomplishing the following two things. First, their purpose is to dispel the concerns of some people who believe that accepting our plan would increase the danger as it was at the Berlin conference. Second, their purpose is to conduct practical experiments in practical arms supervision. Eden said that his purpose is to ensure that the unification of Germany and its freedom to unite with the countries of its choice do not pose a threat to anyone. There is no doubt that there are many ways to do this.

    Eden then spoke about the British proposals on the issue of a unified Germany, saying that these proposals firstly involve the conclusion of a security pact that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and a unified Germany could join. Under the terms of this pact, each country could declare that it is prepared to go to the aid of a country that is subjected to aggression, regardless of who it is. Eden said that such a pact can take many forms. We are willing to suggest that any such pact be placed under the authority of the United Nations. If any member state should disrupt the peace, then that country will thereby lose all rights it enjoys under the pact.

    Secondly, discussions should be held and attempts made to reach agreement on the total number of troops and armaments on each side of Germany and in countries adjacent to Germany. To do this, it would be necessary to participate in a system of mutual supervision to effectively monitor this arrangement. Any suggestions in this regard will not exclude or delay the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

    Eden said that, in addition, there is a suggestion that I certainly believe should be considered, which is that we should be prepared to study the possibility of establishing a demilitarized zone between East and West.

    Eden suggested further study of the proposals he put forward.

    Eden concluded by saying that the standard by which to judge this Four-Power Heads of Government Conference will be whether we can achieve some practical results in the future of Germany and European security. We must agree on two things: the urgent need for a unified Germany and an outline of the methods to be adopted to achieve this unification. I do not want to say that the above ideas on the issue of a unified Germany have the nature of a complete plan, but they are a sketch that can certainly be supplemented once everyone agrees.

### 艾登十八日在日内瓦四国会议上发言

    艾登十八日在日内瓦四国会议上发言
    新华社日内瓦十九日电　英国首相艾登十八日在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上发言。
    艾登在发言中说：四国政府首脑会议在历史上是独一无二的，因为举行这个会议时的情况是人类经验中所没有的。我们时代的科学的和技术的发现已经使我们有可能获得空前的资源。但是如果大国进行战争，就一定会带来完全的毁灭。
    艾登接着说，这些都是严酷的事实，我们或许可以由于体会到这些事实而最后争取到持久和平。这种使人不敢采取好战行动的事实提出了警告，但是这些事实本身并不能解决国际问题或去除我们之间所存在的分歧。四国政府首脑在这里举行会议，就是为了在解决这些问题和分歧上取得进展。在这个会议上必须主要在欧洲范围内处理这些问题，其中主要的是关于德国统一的问题。
    艾登说，德国分裂一天，欧洲就分裂一天。在德国的统一恢复以前，在这个大陆上既不会有信任也不会有安全。
    艾登说，现在必须冷静地研究一下我们现在能从柏林会议上双方大国在德国问题上采取的显然固定的态度前进多少。柏林会议失败的原因是因为其中有一个国家认为一个统一的、重新武装的、有权选择参加北大西洋公约联盟的德国将对它的安全构成更大的威胁。我不打算论证这些恐惧是否有道理。在过去十年中一直存在着很多可以引起猜疑和惊慌的事情。这些已经表现在巨大的军备计划上。为了在更广泛的范围内处理这些问题，我们全都同意通过联合国的裁军委员会来进行工作。我们欢迎委员会最近获得的巨大进展以及现在表现在西方国家的各种建议和苏联政府最近向我们提出的建议上的很大程度的共同思想。所有这些讨论都将继续下去，但是，眼前的需要是要作出一个实际的开端。紧迫的问题是怎样使缓和紧张局势和消除猜疑和恐惧的过程开始。还有一个实际的问题是我们怎样才能够共同想出和执行一个关于军备和军队的有效监督。
    艾登说，重新统一德国本身是不会增加或减少人们可能认为已经存在的对欧洲安全的任何威胁。一切将决定于重新统一的条件。因此我现在打算建议我们考虑一些相互有关的建议，它们的目的是要完成下列两件事。第一，它们的目的是要解除某些人在柏林会议上认为接受我们的计划后危险会有所增加的顾虑。第二，它们的目的是在实际军备监督方面进行实际的实验。艾登说，他的目的是要保证使德国的统一和它享有的同它所选择的国家进行联合的自由不会构成对任何人的威胁。毫无疑问，这样做的办法很多。
    艾登接着谈到英国关于统一德国问题的建议，他说，这些建议首先是缔结一个苏、美、英、法和一个统一的德国可以参加的安全公约。根据这个公约的条款，每个国家可以宣布它自己准备前去援助遭受侵略的国家，不管它是谁。艾登说，这样一个公约可以采取的方式很多。我们愿建议把任何这样的公约置于联合国的权威之下。如果任何成员国竟然破坏和平，那末这个国家就将从而丧失它根据公约所享有的一切权利。
    其次是对德国的每一方和毗连德国的国家的军队和军备的总数进行讨论和设法达成协议。为了这样做，就有必要参加一个相互监督的制度来有效地监督这一安排。在这方面的任何建议将不排除或推延联合国裁军委员会的工作。
    艾登说，此外，有一个建议我肯定认为是应当予以考虑的，这就是应当准备研究在东西方之间设立一个非军事地区的可能性。
    艾登建议对他所提出的建议作进一步的研究。
    艾登最后说，判定这次四国政府首脑会议的标准将是我们能否在德国前途和欧洲安全方面取得某些实际成绩。我们要就两件事情达成一致意见：统一德国的迫切需要性和实现这种统一所应采用的方法的梗概。我并不想说上述关于统一德国问题的主意具有一个完全的计划的性质，但是它们是一张略图，一旦经大家一致同意以后肯定就能补充起来。
