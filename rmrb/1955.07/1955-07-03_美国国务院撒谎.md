　　U.S. State Department Lies
　　Hu Jin
    The U.S. State Department is lying again. It published a pamphlet on June 30, "citing" a "report" from the Ngo Dinh Diem group's "embassy in Washington," claiming that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had doubled its troop strength using war materials transported via China. They even specifically stated that this occurred "in the past five months."
    However, everyone remembers that it wasn't in the past five months, but seven months ago, in November 1954, that Dulles told almost the same lie to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that our country had "aggressive intentions" and that the military strength of North Vietnam had "doubled."
    Dulles' lie had already been shamefully exposed seven months ago. At that time, the International Commission investigated these false accusations and proved them to be complete fabrications. According to an Associated Press dispatch, the International Commission publicly announced: "The Commission is satisfied that there has been no delivery to the Viet Minh, led by the Communists, of significant quantities of ammunition, weapons or military equipment in violation of the Geneva Armistice Agreement." In its recently published third report, the International Commission still affirmed that in North Vietnam "no violations of the agreement have been found."
    It is obviously stupid to repeat lies that have already been exposed. But Dulles has no choice but to do so. The reason is that he is eager to intensify the obstruction of consultations and general elections between North and South Vietnam, and eager to expand the military strength of South Vietnam to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base. In order to cover up these activities and divert attention, he has to pull out these stale clichés from his empty arsenal of lies.
    In fact, he cannot deceive people. The Indian "Delhi Times" pointed out on June 10, when criticizing the U.S. conspiracy to obstruct the Vietnamese general election: "South Vietnam has been constantly strengthening its military strength under the supervision of the United States. If this situation continues at the current rate, peace will definitely be disturbed."
    Isn't the fact obvious? It is the United States itself, and only the United States itself, that is truly violating the Geneva Agreement, transporting large quantities of military materials and military personnel into South Vietnam, and preparing to undermine peace in Vietnam.
    The U.S. State Department's pamphlet also whistles in the dark like a timid night traveler, deceiving itself by saying that U.S. intervention in South Vietnam is not implementing a policy of colonialism and is not trying to replace France's colonial position. This shows that the criticism of public opinion has hit Washington where it hurts. Now, accusations of the United States' intensified efforts to undermine the Geneva Accords and its obvious colonialist attempts are coming from all sides. On the same day that the U.S. State Department published its pamphlet, French General de Gaulle accused: "We are now seeing a new control being formed in Indochina replacing France's position, and this new control seems to want to circumvent the general election that we solemnly promised to promote." People cannot agree with one of de Gaulle's opinions: it seems that because of this, France can circumvent its obligations to fulfill the Geneva Agreement; however, General de Gaulle's accusations against the United States are completely in line with well-known facts.

### 美国国务院撒谎

　　美国国务院撒谎
　　胡今
    美国国务院又在撒谎。它在六月三十日发表了一个小册子，“援引”吴庭艳集团“驻华盛顿大使馆”的“报告”，说什么越南民主共和国用经由中国运入的战争物资，增加了一倍的兵力。他们还确切地指明，这是发生在“过去五个月里”的事。
    但是，大家没有忘记，不是在过去的五个月，而是在七个月以前，一九五四年十一月，杜勒斯就在美国参议院外交委员会上说了几乎同样的谎话，他说我国有“侵略意图”，说越南北部的军事力量“增加了一倍”。
    杜勒斯的谎言在七个月前就已遭到了可耻的破产。当时国际委员会曾经调查了这些诬控，证明这是完全的捏造。据美联社讯，国际委员会曾公开宣布说：“委员会感到满意的是，并没有发生违反日内瓦停战协定，运交共产党领导的越盟以大量弹药、武器或军事装备的事。”在最近发表的第三次报告中，国际委员会还是肯定在北越
  “并未发现任何违反协定事件”。
    把早已破了产的谎话拿来重重复复地讲，明明是很笨的事。但是杜勒斯却不得不如此。原因是，他急于要加紧阻挠南北越协商普选，急于扩充南越军事力量，把南越变成美国的军事基地。为了掩盖他们的这些活动，转移视线，他只得从他的空虚的谎言武器库里搬出这些陈腐滥调。
    其实他是骗不了人的。印度“德里时代”六月十日在抨击美国阴谋阻挠越南普选时就指出：“南越在美国的监督之下一直不断在加强军事力量，如果这种情况以目前速度继续下去的话，和平一定会受到扰乱。”
    事实不是很明显吗？真正违反日内瓦协议，把大量军事物资和军事人员运入南越，准备破坏越南和平的，正是美国自己，也只是美国自己。
    美国国务院的这个小册子还像胆怯的夜行者吹着口哨一样，自己骗自己说，美国在南越的干涉不是执行殖民主义的政策，不是要取代法国殖民主义地位。这说明公众舆论的指责击中了华盛顿的痛处。现在，对美国加紧破坏日内瓦协议的明显的殖民主义企图的指责，正在来自四面八方。法国戴高乐将军在美国国务院发表小册子的同一天，就指责说：“我们现在看到一种新的控制权正在代替法国的地位在印度支那形成，这种新的控制权似乎想规避我们庄严地答应促进的普选。”人们不能同意戴高乐的一种意见：好像因为这样，法国就可以规避自己履行日内瓦协议的义务；但是，戴高乐将军对美国的指责却是完全符合众所周知的事实的。
