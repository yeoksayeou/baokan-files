    National People's Congress Deputies Speak in Group Discussions
    Emphasizing the Need to Prioritize the Development of Heavy Industry
    Xinhua News Agency, July 13th. The deputies of the First National People's Congress, Second Session, continued reading and discussing the draft of the First Five-Year Plan in their respective groups today. Many groups have already read the sections of the draft concerning planned targets for increasing labor productivity and reducing costs, training construction cadres and strengthening scientific research, and improving the material and cultural lives of the people.

    In today's discussions, many groups particularly emphasized the importance of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. Some groups, when discussing the investment allocation ratios in the First Five-Year Plan, believed that prioritizing the development of heavy industry is an unshakable guideline for socialist construction. The ratio stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan draft, where the state's investment in basic construction for industrial departments accounts for 58.2 percent of the total basic construction investment over five years, and investment in industries producing means of production accounts for 88.8 percent of the industrial basic construction investment, is entirely necessary and correct. The deputies expressed boundless excitement about the construction of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, as discussed in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, which will begin in our country within five years. Some deputies also spoke of the importance of chemical fertilizers in increasing the yield per unit area of agricultural products, and the importance of using tractors in expanding the cultivated area, illustrating that only by prioritizing the development of heavy industry can agriculture undergo technical transformation.

    In today's discussions, some groups also discussed the issue of state investment in agricultural construction over the five years. The deputies believed that the state's direct and indirect investment in agriculture over five years, plus the funds invested by the peasants themselves in production, is a very large sum. This ratio is also entirely appropriate. Some deputies from rural areas expressed their intention to widely carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the countryside, increase grain production, and support industrial construction.

    Today, some deputies also cited facts about the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, learned during inspection work, illustrating that the enemies of the people will inevitably adopt various methods to undermine the Five-Year Plan, and that the realization of the Five-Year Plan will inevitably involve serious class struggle. The people of the whole country must be more vigilant and resolutely struggle against various conspiracies and sabotage activities by enemies at home and abroad against the First Five-Year Plan.

    全国人民代表大会代表在分组讨论中发言
    强调必须优先发展重工业
    新华社十三日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议各代表小组今天继续对第一个五年计划草案进行阅读和讨论。许多小组都已阅读到草案中关于提高劳动生产率和降低成本的计划指标、培养建设干部和加强科学研究工作、提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平等部分。
    今天许多代表小组在讨论中，特别强调优先发展重工业的重要意义。有的小组在讨论到第一个五年计划的投资分配比例时，认为优先发展重工业是社会主义建设的不可动摇的方针。第一个五年计划草案中所规定的五年内国家用于工业部门基本建设的投资占整个基本建设投资的百分之五十八点二，而在工业基本建设投资中，用于制造生产资料工业的投资又占百分之八十八点八，这个比例是完全必要的和正确的。代表们对李富春副总理的报告中所谈到的五年内我国将开始和平利用原子能的建设这一点，表示无限兴奋。有的代表还谈到化学肥料对于增加农产品单位面积产量以及使用拖拉机对于扩大耕地面积的重要作用，说明只有优先发展重工业才能使农业得到技术改造。
    在今天的讨论中，有的代表小组也讨论了五年内国家对农业建设的投资问题。代表们认为五年内国家直接和间接用于农业的投资，加上农民自己投入生产的资金，是一笔很大的数目。这个比例也是完全适当的。有些来自农村的代表表示要在农村中广泛开展互助合作运动，增产粮食，支援工业建设。
    今天有的代表还引用在视察工作中所了解到的反革命分子破坏活动的事实，说明人民的敌人必然采取各种方法来破坏五年计划，而实现五年计划必然通过严重的阶级斗争，全国人民必须更加提高警惕性，向国内外敌人对第一个五年计划的各种阴谋破坏活动进行坚决的斗争。
