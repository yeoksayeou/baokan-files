The great iron bridge spanning the Yangtze River, which the Chinese people have longed for for many years and which connects north and south transportation, has officially started construction.

In Wuhan, on the wide Yangtze River, stand two structures composed of dozens of huge cement tubular piles. They pass through deep silt and river water from the bedrock at the bottom of the river, protruding six or seven meters above the surface. Around them are moored power generation ships that provide electricity specifically for water construction, crane ships that look like frogs with hunched backs, small steamships, and crane ships that extend one or twenty meters into the sky unloading various materials. The workers have sunk all the cement tubular piles to the bottom of the river and are using huge drilling machines to drill holes in the rocks at the bottom of the water. In the rapids near the Wuchang river surface, three large iron barges are floating a steel cofferdam as tall as a four-story building. Workers are determining its position on the river, preparing to use three huge crane ships to sink this more than one-hundred-ton cofferdam into the river... Facing this magnificent construction scene, the people of Wuhan are all spreading the news: the Yangtze River Bridge has started construction!

The start of construction of the bridge is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. They helped us revise the technical design of the bridge foundation, abandoned the old technology of building bridges with pneumatic caissons, and created a new technology of using drilling methods to build large tubular pile bearing platform foundations, building bridge pier foundations in the Yangtze River, which is dozens of meters deep. This new technology ensures the safety of workers and reduces the cost of the bridge foundation by 14 million yuan compared to the original plan using pneumatic caissons. With the specific help of Soviet experts, the workers learned to make large cement tubular piles themselves, learned to vertically pass the tubular piles through tens of meters of sand and down to the bedrock, and learned to drill underwater holes and pour underwater concrete along the tubular piles. The workers all said gratefully: The active help of Soviet experts is the decisive key to the early start of the bridge construction.

The scale of mechanized construction of the bridge is very huge. One of the drill bits used to drill holes in the bedrock at the bottom of the Yangtze River is the size of a round table used for banquets and weighs 4.8 tons.

In order to ensure the smooth construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, more than 30 factories in more than a dozen cities including Shenyang, Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuhan are stepping up the production of various machines; factories in many places such as Anshan, Shanhaiguan, Chongqing, and Daye are stepping up the production of steel rails, steel beams, cement, and various steel materials. The Wuchang Shipyard, which has accepted many temporary orders for the bridge, was personally mobilized by the secretary of the CPC Party committee to the workers and stamped the engineering orders with a round seal with the word "bridge." When the workers received this kind of engineering order, they put other work behind and rushed to produce the bridge orders first, and they had to do it quickly and well. Cities such as Tianjin, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Harbin, Guangzhou, and Liuzhou have all sent a large number of new technical forces to the bridge construction site. The Ministry of Railways also transferred a group of people from the Lanxin Line, Baocheng Line, and even the Jier Line and many railway bureaus, and the Railway Engineering Corps transferred a part of the technical force. The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee transferred all the workers from two machine factories and one welding factory to the bridge project. Among these personnel are various technical workers, technicians, and engineers such as divers, riggers, internal combustion engine drivers, welders, riveters, electricians, and concrete workers. The workers who had built the Hanshui Railway Bridge and the Hanshui Highway Bridge have generally improved their technology greatly with the specific help of Soviet experts. Those who did not understand the technology originally have now initially mastered the technology; those who originally had lower technology have now become skilled technicians. Now they have formed an experienced technical team with nearly a hundred engineers as the core. They will fight on the rolling Yangtze River for several years and are preparing to overcome difficulties with the help of Soviet experts and complete the bridge construction project ahead of schedule.

After the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is completed, it will greatly shorten the transportation distance in our country's vast land, and the unbalanced and uneconomical transportation situation will be greatly changed, thereby promoting the exchange of materials throughout the country. The major projects such as the iron and steel joint enterprises, tractor manufacturing plants, and heavy machine tool manufacturing plants that are being built in the interior of the motherland and subsequent production will be further guaranteed in supply.

Bottom picture: The future Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is as high as a twenty-story building from the bottom of the river to the top of the bridge. It is a double-layered bridge for both railway and highway use. The upper layer is a wide highway, which can accommodate multiple large cars driving side by side, and there are 2.5-meter sidewalks on both sides; the lower layer is a double-track railway, which can accommodate trains coming and going. Under the bridge, huge ships can pass unimpeded all year round. Its steel beams are 2,400 tons per bay and there are a total of three sections with nine bays. After the completion of this Yangtze River Bridge, together with its components—the Hanshui Railway Bridge and the Hanshui Highway Bridge—it will connect the two major railway trunk lines, Jinghan and Yuehan, running north and south of our country, and the highway network north and south of the Yangtze River. The three towns of Wuhan will also be integrated.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project adopted the world's latest bridge construction method—the "tubular pile drilling method," which advanced the start date from the original fourth quarter to July. The overall progress of the bridge construction will also be accelerated, and it is expected that the entire project can be completed ahead of schedule.

    横跨长江的第一座大铁桥
    我国人民向往多年的，沟通南北交通的武汉长江大桥工程正式开始施工了。
    在武汉，在宽阔的长江上，屹立着两个由几十根巨大的水泥管柱组成的建筑物。它们从江底岩盘穿过深深的泥沙和江水，露出水面六、七公尺。在它们的周围，停泊着专供水上施工用电的发电船、青蛙似的弓着背的起重船、小火轮和向天空伸出一、二十公尺长颈的吊船起卸着各种器材。工人们已将水泥管柱全部沉到了江底，正用巨大的钻机向水底岩石钻孔。在靠近武昌江面的激流里，三只大铁驳浮运着跟四层楼房一样高大的钢围领。职工纷纷在测定它在江上的位置，准备用三只巨大的吊船，将这个一百多吨重的围领，下沉到江中……面对着这个雄伟的建设工程景象，武汉人民都在传诵着：长江大桥开工了！
    大桥的开工，是与苏联专家的帮助分不开的。他们帮助我们修改了大桥基础技术设计，抛弃了用压气沉箱建桥的旧技术，创造了用钻孔法修建大型管柱承台基础的新技术，在几十公尺深的长江里，建设桥墩基础。这个新技术保证了工人的安全，并使大桥基础的造价比原来使用压气沉箱的计划减少了一千四百万元。职工们在苏联专家的具体帮助下学会了自制大型水泥管柱，学会了将管柱垂直地穿过十几公尺的沙层下到岩盘，学会了顺着管柱进行水下钻孔和浇灌水下混凝土。职工们都感激地说：苏联专家的积极帮助，是大桥提前开工的决定关键。
    大桥机械化施工的规模是非常巨大的。它用来向江底岩石钻孔的钻机的一个钻头，便跟宴会用的圆桌桌面一样大小，有四点八吨重。
    为了保证武汉长江大桥建设顺利进行，沈阳、上海、北京和武汉等十几个城市三十多个工厂正加紧赶制各种机具；鞍山、山海关、重庆和大冶等许多地方的工厂加紧赶制钢轨、钢梁、水泥和各种钢料。接受了大桥许多临时订货的武昌造船厂，由中共党委书记亲自向职工动员，并在工程单上加盖“桥”字的圆章。工人们接到这种工程单，便把其他活往后排，首先赶制大桥订货，并且要做得快，做得好。天津、重庆、兰州、哈尔滨、广州、柳州等城市都向大桥工地输送了大批新的技术力量。铁道部还从兰新线、宝成线，甚至集二线和许多铁路局调来了一批人，铁道兵团调来了一部分技术力量，武汉市人民委员会将两个机器厂和一个电焊厂的职工全部输送给大桥工程。这些人员中，有潜水工、装吊工、内燃机司机、焊工、铆工、电工、混凝土工等各种各样的技术工人、技术员和工程师。曾经建设过汉水铁路桥和公路桥的职工，在苏联专家的具体帮助下，技术上都普遍有很大的提高。原来不懂技术的，现在初步掌握了技术；原来技术较低的，现在成了熟练的技工。现在他们组成了一支以近百名工程师为核心的富有经验的技术队伍。他们要在滚滚的长江上战斗几年，并准备在苏联专家帮助下，克服困难，提前完成大桥建设工程。
    武汉长江大桥建成后，将使我们祖国辽阔广大的土地在运输上大大地缩短了距离，不平衡和不经济的运输状况将大为改变，从而促进全国范围的物资交流。正在祖国内地兴建的钢铁联合企业、拖拉机制造厂和重型工具机制造厂等重大工程及以后的生产，都将在供应上得到进一步的保证。

    下图：未来的武汉长江大桥，从江底到桥顶有二十层楼房高，是一座双层的铁路和公路两用桥。上层是宽阔的公路，可以并列行驶多辆大型汽车，两旁并有两点五公尺的人行道；下层为双轨铁路，可以往来火车。桥下，巨大轮船可以终年通行无阻。它的钢梁每孔有两千四百吨，一共有三联九孔。这座长江大桥建成后，和它的组成部分——汉水铁路和汉水公路桥一起，将使纵贯我国南北的京汉、粤汉两大铁路干线和长江南北的公路网在这里连接起来。武汉三镇也将连成一体。

    武汉长江大桥工程采用了世界上最新的桥梁施工法——“管柱钻孔法”，使开工日期由原定的第四季度提前到七月份。大桥的施工总进度也将加快，预计整个工程可以因此提前完工。图为长江大桥正桥二号桥墩钢笼架开始下沉。　　　湖北日报　张其军摄
