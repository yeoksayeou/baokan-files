　　China's First Self-Built Yellow River Bridge
　　Zeng Yagang, Chief Engineer of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge

    The workers responsible for constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Main Bridge feel a sense of victorious joy every time they think about the trains, fully loaded with passengers, petroleum, and other materials, crossing the Yellow River on this bridge. This is because this iron bridge was designed and constructed by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, guided by the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, using their own wisdom and strength, and built entirely with domestically produced materials. This is an unprecedented achievement in our country's history.

    There were many difficulties in building this bridge. When construction began in the spring of 1954, we encountered a difficulty we had never encountered before: driving circular steel sheet pile cofferdams in the turbulent currents of the Yellow River, known as the "natural barrier." How to construct it? After two discussions between technicians and veteran workers, they unanimously agreed that only a rotating piling frame could be used for construction. But what kind of piling frame, and how could the piling frame rotate, and other specific issues followed. After understanding these issues, the Party Committee of the engineering team asked the technicians to propose a preliminary plan as a basis for mobilizing the masses for further research. The technicians worked hard for three days and three nights and produced preliminary design drawings for the turntable piling frame. The leaders of the engineering team then convened a discussion with the workers. At the meeting, the engineer explained the function of each part of the turntable piling frame. Based on their rich work experience, the workers proposed many modifications, such as changing the position of the turntable rollers, changing the center axis, padding the front of the piling frame, and removing the rear herringbone pole... The workers were very concerned about the manufacturing of the turntable piling frame. After the first design drawing was completed, all the workers of the hoisting team responsible for the construction task discussed it again. They proposed the suggestion of threading pulleys on the power machine, which saved a lot of manpower during construction.

    With the turntable piling frame, the task was overfulfilled by 15.3 percent in April of last year—the first month of construction. Without the turntable piling frame, it would have been very difficult to build the steel sheet pile cofferdam, and it would have been difficult to carry out the construction of the bridge pier foundation, and the entire construction period would have been delayed indefinitely.

      June, July, August, and September of 1954 were the flood season. After October, it was winter construction, and the workers had to work in temperatures of minus twenty-five degrees Celsius.

    The No. 5 pier is located in the heart of the Yellow River, and construction could only begin after the flood season. The steel sheet pile cofferdam had to be built after the flood season and before the river froze. As soon as the workers built the steel sheet pile cofferdam, the river froze. At this time, according to the original construction steps, it was impossible to fill the cofferdam with sand and gravel. The ice in the cofferdam froze as soon as one layer was dug out, and there was no end to it. The workers held cold iron rods with their already frostbitten hands and stood on ice floes, working day and night to first break a hole in the ice cover, and then poured the sand and gravel into the hole bit by bit. After the sand and gravel were filled, a concrete caisson up to thirteen meters high was poured on it. This caisson was poured in three sections, and each section was sunk once it was poured. If the ordinary curing method was used, each section would require a curing period of twenty-one days, then the curing period for just three sections would be sixty-three days. In this way, the construction period would be prolonged, which was not acceptable. We learned the advanced Soviet capillary steam curing method, which overcame the difficulties. Each section of the caisson only needed a maximum of three days of curing.

    The caisson weighed more than a thousand tons. To sink this behemoth seven meters into hard soil and rock layers, and to sink it steadily to the bottom without being skewed (the error must not exceed one percent), was a very complex and meticulous task. Soviet expert Shaburi told us that we should use the advanced method of excavating and backfilling by jumping trenches before sinking. However, when we started to use this method, many workers couldn't understand it, thinking that it was too laborious and time-consuming to excavate and fill it up again, and then slowly sink the caisson layer by layer. In order to overcome this ideological obstacle, the Party Committee held a conference on "Resolutely Implementing the Soviet Experts' Suggestions," explaining that the method proposed by the experts was the only method to sink the caisson safely. The young people of the youth shock brigade specially organized for digging the No. 5 deep caisson, used all their strength to clamp the pneumatic drill in the dark deep well, chiseling out the rocks piece by piece, ensuring the successful sinking of the caisson.

    While full-scale intense winter construction was underway, an ice bridge had formed downstream seven kilometers from the bridge site—the river was frozen. In less than an hour, the flowing water in the downstream ice-sealed area reversed and rose, lifting the thick ice dam that had formed around the construction pontoon bridge. The construction pontoon bridge made a loud cracking sound, and the flat bridge deck was lifted into an arch shape, and the wooden piles inserted into the riverbed were pulled up. When the reversed river water rose to a certain height, it collapsed the ice bridge downstream. The suddenly falling ice river turned into an avalanche of ice flow. The huge ice blocks upstream collided with each other and rushed towards the pontoon bridge. As more and more ice blocks gathered downstream, the river water was blocked again and flowed back upstream.

    In this emergency, the engineering team ordered the workers working on the ice to retreat to both banks. However, many construction machines were still parked on the bridge piers and construction pontoon bridge, and they were about to be washed away by the ever-increasing ice surges. The workers knew that if these machines were washed away, the state property would suffer huge losses, and the construction progress would be affected. Therefore, they rushed out one after another and used the power winches on both banks to drag back the heavy machinery. The ice flow did not allow people to hesitate. After a ten-minute study by the Party Committee, it was decided to use the gap between the river's backflow and the possible safe working time to rescue the machinery in groups. Communist Party member Xu Jiafu—the leader of the hoisting team, according to the instructions of the Party Committee, divided the thirty workers of the hoisting team into two groups, put on waterproof life vests, and quickly boarded the construction pontoon bridge. Some of them removed the small steel rails on the pontoon bridge at an almost unimaginable speed, opening up a road for transporting the machinery. Some used steel cables to secure the steam winches parked there. After several tens of minutes of fighting, they rescued the ten-ton machines from the precarious pontoon bridge. At the same time, another group had gone to the No. 3 pier to rescue the water pump. The workers of the concrete team on the other side of the river had rushed to the steel sheet pile of the No. 6 pier to rescue the machine. Communist Party member Han Shuguo, the leader of the small team, carried a cement vibrator weighing eighty kilograms on his shoulder, climbed out of the steel sheet pile cofferdam, and ran a hundred meters on the ice in one breath. An hour later, when the ice bridge was washed away again, and hundreds of square meters of ice blocks upstream crashed down with the torrent, the heroic workers had rescued all the construction machinery and materials.

    In early May this year, the No. 5 pier caisson was only a few inches away from sinking to the bottom. At this moment, the flood arrived ahead of schedule. The turbulent waves hit the steel sheet pile cofferdam and broke the large wooden support inside the cofferdam. The flood became larger and larger, and finally crossed the heightened embankment inside the cofferdam and poured down into the caisson. The people in the well, on the well, on the bridge, and on the boat all put on life jackets and worked in a fighting posture.

    On May 24, the flood overturned the already heightened embankment in the No. 5 pier cofferdam with its final power and filled the No. 5 pier cofferdam. But our pier had been heightened by one meter twenty-four hours ago. We finally defeated the flood. The flood helplessly and slowly calmed down. We seized this opportunity, intensified our work, and finally poured the last bucket of concrete for the No. 5 pier on the afternoon of June 1, completing all the main projects fourteen days ahead of schedule.

    On July 1, the Yellow River Bridge was officially opened to traffic. The workers who built the Yellow River Bridge will take the accumulated work experience and happily go to the site of the Yellow River arch bridge of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway!

　　我国自己修建的第一座黄河大桥
　　兰新铁路黄河大桥主管工程师　曾亚岗
    负责修建兰新铁路黄河正桥的职工们，每次想到那满载旅客、石油和其他物资的火车将从这座大桥上越过黄河的时候，都感到一种胜利的愉快。这是因为这座铁桥是中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联先进经验指导下，以自己的智慧和力量进行设计和施工，并且完全用国产材料建设起来的。这在我国历史上还是创举。
    建设这座桥梁遇到的困难是很多的。一九五四年春天开始施工的时候，我们就遇到一个从来没有遇到过的困难，这就是要在号称“天堑”的黄河激流中打圆形的钢板桩围堰。怎样施工呢？技术人员和老工人们两次座谈以后，一致认为只有采用能转动的打桩架才能施工。但到底是什么样的打桩架、打桩架又怎能转动等等具体问题也跟着来了。工程队党委会了解了这些问题后，要求技术人员设法提出初步方案，作为发动群众进一步研究的依据。技术人员们辛勤劳动了三天三夜，把转盘打桩架的初步设计图样搞出来了。工程队的领导人员又召集工人们座谈。会上，工程师把转盘打桩架各部分的作用作了解释，工人们根据自己丰富的劳动经验，提出了很多修改意见，例如转盘滚轮应改变位置，轴心也应该改变，打桩架前面可以垫起，后面的人字扒杆可以取消……职工们非常关心转盘打桩架的制造，第一张设计图样已经弄好以后，担负施工任务的起重队全体职工又讨论一次，他们提出了在动力机上穿挂滑车的建议，使施工时又节省很多人力。
    有了转盘打桩架，去年四月——施工的第一个月，就超额百分之十五点三完成任务。要是没有转盘打桩架，钢板桩围堰就很难筑起，因而也就很难进行桥墩基础部分的施工，整个建设工期也就不知拖延到何年何月去了。
      一九五四年六、七、八、九四个月是洪水期。十月以后就是冬季施工，职工们就要在零下二十五度的气温下工作。
    五号桥墩位于黄河河心，必须过了洪水期才能施工，钢板桩围堰又必须在洪水期以后、冰封期以前做好。工人们刚筑起钢板桩围堰，河就冰封了。这时，按照原来的施工步骤，把砂石填到围堰里去是不行了。围堰内的冰刚被挖了一层又冻上了一层，一直没有个完。职工们用已经冻肿的手握着冰冷的长铁钎，双脚站在冰块上，日夜不停地先将冰盖捣开一个洞，再把砂石从洞口一点一点地倒进去。沙石填筑好了，就在上面灌注高达十三公尺的水泥沉井。这个沉井是分三节灌注的，每灌好一节就下沉一次。如果采用平常的养生方法，每一节灌好后需要二十一天的养生期，那末单单三节的养生期，就要六十三天。这样，工期就要拖长，这是不行的。我们学习了苏联先进的毛细孔蒸气养生法，才克服了困难，每节沉井最多只要三天养生期就行。
    沉井有一千多吨重。要把这个庞然大物在硬土和岩石层中下沉七公尺，并且不歪不斜地（误差数不得超过百分之一）平稳地下沉到底，是一个十分复杂的细致的工作。苏联专家沙布里告诉我们：应采用跳槽挖空回填以后再下沉的先进方法。可是，在开始采用这个方法的时候，很多工人都想不通，认为挖空了又填起来，再慢慢地把沉井一层一层下沉，太费工费时了。为了克服这个思想障碍。党委会召开了一个“坚决贯彻苏联专家建议”的大会，说明专家提出的方法，是唯一能稳妥地下沉沉井的方法。特为挖五号深沉井而组织起来的青年突击班的青年们，在阴暗的深井中，用全身的气力夹着风钻，将岩石一块一块凿出，保证了沉井的胜利下沉。
    正在进行全面的紧张的冬季施工的时候，在桥位下游七公里的地方，已经结成冰桥——封河了。没有一点钟工夫，下游冰封地方的流水就倒流上涨，把施工便桥周围结起的厚厚的冰坝抬起来了。施工便桥发出喳喳的巨响，平正的桥面被掀成了弓形，插在河床上的木桩被拔了起来。当倒流上来的河水涨到一定的高度的时候，又冲垮了下游的冰桥。陡然下降的冰河，变成了排山倒海似的冰流。上游巨大的冰块又互相撞击冲向便桥。当下游的冰块越聚越多的时候，河水又遇阻倒流上来。
    在这种紧急的情况下，工程队命令在冰上施工的工人们撤退到两岸来。但是，在桥墩上和施工便桥上还停放了很多施工机械，眼看就要被一次比一次高的涌冰冲走。职工们知道这些机械被冲走了，国家财产就遭到巨大损失，施工进度就受到影响。所以，他们纷纷赶出，利用两岸的动力绞车把笨重的机械拖回来。冰流是不容许人们犹豫的。党委会进行十分钟的研究以后，决定利用河水倒流的间隙和可能安全工作的时间，分组抢救机械。共产党员徐家富——起重队小队长，根据党委会的指示，把起重队的三十位工人分成两组，穿好防水救生背心后，就敏捷地登上了施工便桥。他们一部分人几乎是用难以想像的速度拆除便桥上小钢轨，为搬运机械开辟道路。一部分人用钢丝绳拴好停放在那里的蒸汽绞车，经过几十分钟的搏斗，才把十吨重的机器从摇摇欲坠的便桥上抢救出来。同时，另一小组已到三号墩内去抢救抽水机。河那边的混凝土小队的职工们，已赶到六号墩的钢板桩那里抢救机器。小队长共产党员韩树国把一个重八十公斤的洋灰震荡器扛在肩上，翻出钢板桩围堰，一口气在冰上跑了一百公尺远。一小时后，当冰桥又被冲垮，上游数百平方公尺大的冰块随着巨流冲击下来的时候，英勇的职工们已把全部施工机械和材料抢救出来了。
    今年五月初，五号桥墩沉井还差几公寸就要下沉到底了。就在这时，洪水提前到来了。汹涌的浪头向钢板桩围堰袭来，冲断了围堰内的支撑大圆木。洪水越来越大，终于越过了围堰内加高的堤防，泻下沉井。在井下、井上、桥上、船上的人，都穿上救生衣，以战斗的姿态进行工作。
    五月二十四日，洪水以最后的威力翻过了五号墩围堰内已经加高了的堤防，灌满了五号墩的围堰。可是我们的桥墩已在二十四小时前加高了一公尺。我们最后战胜了洪水。洪水无可奈何地慢慢平稳下来了。我们抓住了这个机会，加紧工作，终于在六月一日下午灌完了五号墩最后一斗混凝土，提前十四天完成全部主体工程。
    七月一日，黄河大桥正式通车了。修建黄河大桥的工人们将带着积累起来的工作经验，愉快地走向包兰铁路的黄河大拱桥工地！
