　　严春庵雍文谦访问黄土岗农业生产合作社
    新华社三十日讯　越南民主共和国政府代表团团员严春庵、雍文谦，三十日上午到北京郊区访问了黄土岗农业生产合作社。
    合作社主任殷维臣向贵宾们介绍了农业生产合作社的情况。这个合作社是在互助组的基础上发展起来的，共有社员二百九十八户。越南民主共和国农林部长严春庵对合作社的情况有兴趣，询问很详细。
    贵宾们参观了生长着茂盛农作物的田地、供销合作社和一所小学，访问了社员的家庭。
    贵宾们并访问了殷维臣的家。殷维臣告诉贵宾们，他的祖父和父亲都是雇工出身，他自己从十四岁起就给地主做工，直到解放后分到三十多亩土地，才结束了被剥削的生活。他们全家都参加合作社劳动，每年收入二千多元，一九五四年的收入除全家吃穿外，还有五百多元的剩余。
    殷维臣指着他住的一所有明净的玻璃窗的房子说，这是解放以后新盖起来的。解放前他住的是土屋，天一下雨屋里就漏水，下大雨时人都不敢在屋里睡觉。
    贵宾们并和殷维臣家里的人们在摆着许多花盆的院子里合影留念。
    这个合作社的社员还把自己生产的西红柿、青椒和茉莉花送给贵宾们。
