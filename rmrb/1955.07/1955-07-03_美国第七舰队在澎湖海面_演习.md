Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd:

Under the direction of Rear Admiral H.T. Jewett, commander of Task Force 72 of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the U.S. Seventh Fleet conducted a large-scale "patrol exercise" on July 1 in the waters near Penghu in the Taiwan Strait. This is the first time the United States has used the Penghu base as the center of an exercise.

This exercise, which closely followed the "visit" to Taiwan by newly appointed U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Burke, is another manifestation of the U.S.'s continuous war preparations in the Taiwan area.
