　　The summer harvest crops have already begun, and the summer grain unified purchase work has already started. In order to guarantee the food supply for urban and rural people before the autumn harvest, and to lay the foundation for completing the annual grain unified purchase task, we must do everything possible to do a solid job of the summer grain unified purchase work.

　　This year's summer grain unified purchase is the first grain unified purchase after the implementation of the policy of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales. Throughout the country, in the first quarter of this year, the policy of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales was widely publicized, and the targets for grain unified purchase and sales for the 1955-1956 fiscal year were passed down level by level to the villages, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. However, due to the short time, many places have not had time to allocate the grain unified purchase and sales targets to individual households. Therefore, some farmers say: "The 'Three Fixes' method is good, but how will it actually work?" Now, the major summer grain producing areas will specifically evaluate the summer grain unified purchase targets for each household. This is an extremely complex and meticulous task. If this work is done well, it will allow the broad masses of farmers to appreciate the benefits of the grain "Three Fixes" policy from practical experience, further enhance the enthusiasm of farmers, and lay a good foundation for this year's autumn grain unified purchase work.

　　The summer grain unified purchase task determined by the state takes into account both the needs of the state and the possibilities of the farmers. Therefore, this task can be completed. Judging from the wheat planting area and this year's harvest conditions, the national wheat output can basically maintain last year's level. This year, the planting area of early rice and mid-season rice has been expanded compared to last year. If the harvest of early rice and mid-season rice is normal, the total summer grain output this year will increase compared to last year; however, the figures for summer grain collection and unified purchase determined by the state are about the same as last year. Furthermore, judging from the situation after the widespread publicity and implementation of the measures for fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales this spring, the broad masses of farmers have a further understanding of the grain unified purchase and sales policy, and their socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm have also been further enhanced. These are the favorable conditions for completing this year's summer grain unified purchase task.

　　However, we should also fully estimate the possible difficulties in this year's summer grain unified purchase work. Due to the severe natural disasters last year and the once tense situation of grain unified sales in rural areas of some provinces and regions this spring, some farmers' concerns about the state's grain policy may not have been completely eliminated, and their reluctance to sell may continue to exist; the confidence of some rural staff in completing this year's summer grain unified purchase task may also be affected. Therefore, during the summer grain unified purchase, all localities must further conduct in-depth publicity and education on the grain unified purchase and sales policy and the policy of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales to rural staff and the broad masses of farmers, so that they can further understand the great significance of grain unified purchase and sales to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and, based on the specific conditions of their locality, check some shortcomings in this work and point out ways to correct them. In this way, the rural staff can be more confident, and the broad masses of farmers can understand the "bottom line" of the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy and actively sell their surplus grain to the state.

　　The proportion of summer grain harvest in the total annual grain output varies in different parts of our country. Therefore, different methods and steps should be taken in the summer grain unified purchase. In the double-cropping areas where the summer grain harvest accounts for a considerable proportion, after the summer grain unified purchase targets are allocated to the villages, the unified purchase figures for each farm household should be rationally assessed based on the summer grain output and the amount of grain used by the farmers themselves. When farmers sell summer grain, the state grain collection point should issue a grain sales certificate so that the total annual unified purchase figures can be settled uniformly during the autumn grain unified purchase.

　　In the summer grain unified purchase work, it is necessary to combine it with the grain unified sales work. In the past, during the summer grain and autumn grain unified purchase periods, the shortcoming of "attaching importance to unified purchase and neglecting unified sales" was quite common in various places. This was mainly manifested in: during the approximately eight-month period from the end of the summer harvest to February of the following year (i.e., the season when farmers have more grain in hand), the control of unified sales was too loose and the grain sales volume was too large; and then after March (i.e., the season when farmers need to buy more grain), a situation of tight grain supply was caused. This year, the leading organs in many regions have emphasized the importance of combining unified purchase work with unified sales work when deploying the summer grain unified purchase work, which is very necessary. However, some leading organs and staff in some regions have not given due attention to this issue. For example, after the start of the summer harvest, the leading organs in some areas of Anhui Province, seeing that the farmers already had food at hand, thought that there was no problem and attempted to hastily announce the end of the ongoing rectification of grain unified sales work. This erroneous thinking and attitude towards unified sales work must be criticized and corrected. In areas where the summer grain harvest accounts for a major proportion, it is necessary to determine the annual unified sales targets in accordance with the spirit of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales, while carrying out the unified purchase work; in other areas, it is equally necessary to make proper arrangements for the rural grain unified sales work in July, August, and September of this year while carrying out the summer grain unified purchase work, and to effectively allocate the unified sales targets for these three months rationally to the villages, and to mobilize the masses to repeatedly evaluate and correctly allocate the supply figures to those farmers who are truly short of grain.

　　Farmers in wheat-producing areas often need to buy some miscellaneous grains and rice as food after selling wheat. This year, the state has allocated a large amount of miscellaneous grains and rice to supply the people in disaster areas, and it is no longer possible to supply a large batch of miscellaneous grains and rice to the major wheat-producing provinces and regions. Under this circumstance, on the one hand, all provinces and counties should do their utmost to organize variety adjustments in the grain market and strive to do a good job in the variety allocation and adjustment work in their own counties and regions. On the other hand, farmers in wheat-producing areas should adhere to the principle of "eat what you have" and try to save on the consumption of miscellaneous grains and rice as much as possible.

　　During the summer grain collection and unified purchase period, effective measures must be taken to strengthen the management of the national grain market and strictly prohibit speculative merchants and grain processing operators from purchasing grain through illegal means. At the same time, farmers should be educated to first sell summer grain directly to the designated state grain collection points during the unified purchase period. After the end of the summer grain collection and unified purchase work, farmers should be allowed and encouraged to conduct grain adjustment in the national grain market. We must organize the national grain market better so that farmers can freely sell their surplus grain and adjust varieties in the grain market after completing the summer grain purchase task, which is very necessary. All localities must further do a good job in the work of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales, so as to appropriately relax the management of the grain market on this basis, and do more publicity and explanation to the farmers, so that the households with surplus grain can dispel their concerns and sell their surplus grain to the national grain market with peace of mind.

　　Both the summer grain unified purchase and the arrangement of grain unified sales work are carried out during the busy farming season. In order to ensure that these two tasks do not affect agricultural production, the Party committees and governments of all localities should make unified arrangements for the various rural tasks in this stage, make a reasonable division of labor, and strengthen specific leadership. The grain business departments must effectively improve the grain inspection, storage and transportation work, and conscientiously implement the principle of pricing according to quality. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should do a good job in the supply of materials in the concentrated summer grain producing areas. All relevant departments must closely cooperate and coordinate their actions under the unified leadership of the Party committees and governments of all localities, and complete the tasks of summer grain unified purchase and arranging grain unified sales smoothly in the shortest possible time, focusing on the intense summer agricultural production.

### 在“三定”政策的基础上完成夏粮统购任务

　　在“三定”政策的基础上完成夏粮统购任务
    夏收作物已经登场，夏粮统购工作已经开始。为了保证秋收以前城乡人民的食粮，并为完成全年的粮食统购任务打下基础，我们必须尽一切力量，把夏粮统购工作切实做好。
    今年的夏粮统购是在粮食定产、定购、定销的政策实行以后的第一次粮食统购。全国各地在今年第一季度普遍宣传了粮食定产、定购、定销的政策，并将一九五五——一九五六年度的粮食统购统销的指标逐级下达到乡以后，得到了广大农民的热烈拥护。但由于时间短促，许多地方还没有来得及把粮食统购统销的指标分配到户，因此，有的农民说：“三定办法是好的，实行起来究竟怎么样呢？”现在，夏粮的主要产区就要具体地把夏粮统购的指标评议到户了。这是一项极为复杂的细致的工作。这个工作做好了，就会使广大农民从实际经验中体会到粮食“三定”政策的好处，进一步提高农民的积极性，并给今年的秋粮统购工作打下一个良好的基础。
    国家确定的夏粮统购任务，既照顾了国家的需要，也照顾了农民的可能，因此，这个任务是可以完成的。从小麦种植面积和今年的年景来看，全国小麦产量基本上可以保持去年的水平。今年早稻、中稻种植面积比去年扩大了，如果早稻、中稻的收成正常，今年整个夏粮产量将比去年有所增加；而国家确定的夏粮征收和统购数字，却同去年差不多。再从今年春季普遍宣传和贯彻粮食定产、定购、定销的措施以后的情况来看，广大农民对于粮食统购统销政策有了进一步的认识，他们的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性也有了进一步的提高。这些就是完成今年夏粮统购任务的有利条件。
    但是，我们也应该充分估计到今年夏粮统购工作中可能产生的困难。由于去年严重的自然灾害和今年春季部分省区农村粮食统销情况一度紧张，少数农民对于国家粮食政策的某些疑虑可能还没有完全消除，他们的惜售心理可能继续存在；某些农村工作人员对完成今年夏粮统购任务的信心也可能受到影响。因此，各地在夏粮统购的时候，必须进一步向农村工作人员和广大农民进行深入的关于粮食统购统销政策和粮食定产、定购、定销政策的宣传教育，使他们进一步认识粮食统购统销对国计民生的重大意义，并且根据当地的具体情况，检查这一工作中的某些缺点，指出改正的办法。这样，就可使农村工作人员更有信心，使广大农民摸清国家粮食统购统销政策的“底”，积极地把余粮卖给国家。
    我国各地夏粮收成占全年粮食产量的比重是不相同的，因此，在夏粮统购时要采取不同的方法和步骤。在夏粮收获量占有相当比重的一年两熟地区，把夏粮统购指标分配到乡以后，要根据夏粮的产量和农民自用粮食的数量，合理地评议出各个农户的统购数字。农民卖出夏粮，应由国家收粮点发给售粮证，以便在秋粮统购时再统一结算全年的统购数字。
    在夏粮统购工作中，必须结合做好粮食统销工作。过去各地在夏粮和秋粮统购期间，曾经相当普遍地发生过“重视统购，轻视统销”的缺点，这主要表现在：在夏收后到次年二月的大约八个月的期间（即农民手里有粮较多的季节），对统销控制过松，粮食销量过大；而到三月以后（即农民需要买粮较多的季节）就引起粮食供应紧张的局面。今年许多地区的领导机关在布置夏粮统购工作时，就已强调了统购工作和统销工作相结合的重要性，这是非常必要的。但是也有一些地区的领导机关和工作人员对这个问题还没有加以应有的重视。例如，安徽省有些地区的领导机关在夏收开始以后，看到农民眼前已有口粮，便认为没有问题了，企图把正在进行的整顿粮食统销工作草草宣布结束。这种对待统销工作的错误思想和态度，必须加以批判和纠正。在夏粮收成占主要比重的地区应即按照粮食定产、定购、定销的精神，在统购工作进行的同时，确定一年的统销指标；在其他地区同样必须在进行夏粮统购工作的同时，对今年七、八、九月份的农村粮食统销工作加以妥善的安排，切实把这三个月份的统销指标合理地分配到乡，并发动群众反复评议，把供应数字正确地分配给那些真正缺粮的农民。
    产麦区农民常常要在卖出小麦以后买进部分杂粮、大米作为口粮。今年国家已经调拨大量杂粮和大米供应灾区人民，不可能再向各主要产麦省区供应大批杂粮和大米。在这种情况下，一方面，各省各县应当尽最大的力量，在粮食市场上组织品种调剂，力求做好本县本区的品种调拨和调剂工作。另一方面，产麦区的农民应当按照“有什么吃什么”的原则，尽量节约杂粮和大米的消费。
    在夏粮征收、统购期间，必须采取有效措施，加强对国家粮食市场的管理，严禁投机商贩和粮食复制业者套购粮食。同时，应当教育农民在统购期间，首先把夏粮直接卖给指定的国家收粮点。在夏粮征收、统购工作结束以后，应该允许和鼓励农民到国家粮食市场上去进行粮食调剂。我们要把国家粮食市场组织得更好，以便农民在完成夏粮征购任务以后可以到粮食市场自由地出售余粮，调剂品种，这是十分必要的。各地必须进一步做好粮食定产、定购、定销的工作，以便在这个基础上适当放宽粮食市场的管理，并对农民多作宣传解释，使余粮户打消顾虑，放心地拿出他们的余粮到国家粮食市场去出售。
    夏粮统购和安排粮食统销工作都是在农忙季节进行的。为了保证这两项工作不至影响农业生产，各地党委和政府应对这一阶段的各项农村工作进行统一的安排，加以合理的分工，并加强具体的领导。粮食业务部门要切实改善粮食验收、储运工作，切实贯彻依质论价的原则。国营商业和供销合作社要做好夏粮集中产区的物资供应工作。所有各个有关部门都必须在各地党委和政府的统一领导下，密切配合，协同动作，在尽可能短的时间内，以紧张的夏季农业生产为中心，顺利地完成夏粮统购和安排粮食统销的工作任务。
