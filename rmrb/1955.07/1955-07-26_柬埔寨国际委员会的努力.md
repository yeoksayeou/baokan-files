    Efforts of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia

    Recently, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia submitted its second interim report, describing the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Cambodia from January to March this year and the many efforts the commission has made in this regard.

    The report indicates that, thanks to the efforts of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia, the Royal Government has taken some positive measures to safeguard the democratic freedoms of former Khmer Resistance fighters. The Royal Government of Cambodia has released some of the imprisoned former Khmer Resistance fighters. On January 14 this year, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement expressing its willingness to issue identity cards to former Khmer Resistance fighters, enabling them to join the common life of Cambodia and enjoy various political rights. As the International Commission's report points out, these measures are welcome. However, the report also mentions that some former Khmer Resistance fighters are still being illegally detained, and others, along with their families, are still being persecuted by local authorities and police of the Royal Government; at the same time, some former Khmer Resistance fighters still face various difficulties when applying for identity cards. It should be pointed out that the Geneva Agreements clearly stipulate: retaliation against former Khmer Resistance fighters and their families is prohibited; "everyone shall enjoy the constitutional guarantees of protection of person, property and democratic freedoms without any discrimination." There is reason to demand that the provisions of the Geneva Agreements should be thoroughly implemented.

    The report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia also mentioned the plan proposed by the Royal Government of Cambodia on February 19 to amend the constitutional provisions on elections. According to this plan, only residents who have lived in the electoral district for more than three years have the right to participate in the election. The International Commission believes that while it does not intend to interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs, it has a responsibility to review whether this election reform plan complies with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements regarding the participation of all Cambodian citizens in the election. The report pointed out that all members of the International Commission
  "suspected that certain aspects of this plan might be inconsistent with the international obligations undertaken by the Royal Government" and had informally urged the Royal Government of Cambodia in a private capacity to consider this issue calmly and carefully before making a final decision. This position and view of the International Commission are entirely correct. The report shows that, due to strong domestic opposition in Cambodia, the aforementioned election reform plan has been quickly abandoned.

    In this report, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia stated that, as of March this year, the commission had no matters to report regarding the establishment of foreign military bases in Cambodia or the conclusion of military alliances with foreign countries. However, this situation has recently changed completely. On May 16 this year, the United States concluded a military aid agreement with Cambodia. This agreement is clearly a violation of the Geneva Agreements. The Cambodian people and public opinion have risen up in opposition to the United States imposing this agreement on their country. Many peace-loving countries and peoples determined to uphold the Geneva Agreements have also pointed out the seriousness of this US violation of the Geneva Agreements. Stopping the implementation of the US-Cambodian military agreement and safeguarding Cambodia's neutrality has become the primary task of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia.

    On September 11 this year, a national election will be held in Cambodia. The Geneva Agreements stipulate that the Royal Government of Cambodia should "take measures to enable all citizens to participate in the common life of the country, especially in the recent general election, which will be held in 1955 in accordance with the constitution of each country, respecting basic freedoms and by secret ballot." However, it has been noted that the Royal Government of Cambodia has not only signed a military aid agreement with the United States, but also adopted high-handed measures against the legitimate opposition of the Cambodian people to the US-Cambodian agreement, even closing newspapers that oppose the US-Cambodian agreement and arresting editors who oppose the US-Cambodian agreement. One cannot help but ask: If the Royal Government of Cambodia disregards the opposition of the vast majority of the people and insists on implementing the US-Cambodian agreement; if the Royal Government of Cambodia continues to adopt high-handed measures against the opposition of the Cambodian people to the US-Cambodian agreement, then what guarantee is there that the national election in September this year will be conducted "under conditions respecting basic freedoms"? All peace-loving countries and peoples determined to uphold the Geneva Agreements demand that the Royal Government of Cambodia respect the wishes of the vast majority of the people, maintain Cambodia's neutral status in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements, and ensure that the national election in September can truly be held under conditions that respect basic freedoms.

    Over the past year, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia has carried out arduous work to uphold the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Cambodia, overcome various difficulties, and achieved great results. People believe that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia will continue to work hard and make further contributions to the thorough implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Cambodia.

### 柬埔寨国际委员会的努力

    柬埔寨国际委员会的努力
    最近，柬埔寨国际委员会提出了第二次临时报告，叙述了今年一月到三月在柬埔寨实施日内瓦协议的情况以及委员会为此所做的许多工作。
    报告表明，由于柬埔寨国际委员会的努力，王国政府在保障前高棉抗战人员的民主自由方面采取了一些积极的措施。柬埔寨王国政府释放了一部分被监禁的前高棉抗战人员。柬埔寨王国政府并在今年一月十四日发表声明，表示愿意发给前高棉抗战人员以身份证，使他们可以加入柬埔寨的共同生活并享受各种政治权利。正如国际委员会的报告所指出，这些措施都是值得欢迎的。但是，报告也提到：还有一些前高棉抗战人员仍然被非法拘禁，另一些前高棉抗战人员和他们的家属也仍然遭到王国政府地方当局和警察的迫害；同时，某些前高棉抗战人员在申请身份证时还仍然遭到种种困难。应该指出：日内瓦协议明确规定：禁止对前高棉抗战人员及其家属实行报复；“每个人应不受任何歧视地享受保护人身、财产与民主自由的宪法的保障”。人们有理由要求，日内瓦协议的规定应该被彻底实施。
    柬埔寨国际委员会的报告中也曾提到今年二月十九日柬埔寨王国政府所提出的修改宪法中关于选举的规定的计划。按照这一计划，只有在选举区内定居三年以上的居民，才有参加选举的权利。国际委员会认为：它虽然无意干涉柬埔寨的内政，但是它有责任审查这一选举改革计划是否符合于日内瓦协议中关于柬埔寨全体公民均能参加选举的规定。报告指出：国际委员会各委员都
  “怀疑此一计划的某些方面可能与王国政府所承担的国际义务有不符之处”，并曾以私人的身份非正式地敦促柬埔寨王国政府在作出最后决定前冷静而仔细地对这个问题加以考虑。国际委员会这种立场和看法是完全正确的。报告表明，由于柬埔寨国内的强烈反对，上述选举改革计划已经很快地被放弃。
    柬埔寨国际委员会在这一次报告中说，截至今年三月止，关于在柬埔寨建立外国军事基地或同外国订立军事同盟的问题，委员会还没有任何事项可以报告。但是，这个情况最近已经完全改变。今年五月十六日，美国同柬埔寨订立了军事援助协定。这一协定显然是违反日内瓦协议的。柬埔寨人民和舆论已经群起反对美国把这一协定强加在他们的国家的头上。许多爱好和平、决心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民也已经指出了美国这种违反日内瓦协议的行为的严重性。制止美柬军事协定的实施、维护柬埔寨的中立，已经成为柬埔寨国际委员会当前的首要任务。
    今年九月十一日，在柬埔寨将举行全国性的选举。日内瓦协议规定：柬埔寨王国政府应该“采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施，特别是参加最近的普选，此项普选将在一九五五年内根据各该国宪法在尊重基本自由的条件下以秘密投票方式举行。”但是人们注意到，柬埔寨王国政府不仅同美国签订了军事援助协定，而且对于柬埔寨人民对美柬协定的正当反对，采取了高压的手段，甚至于封闭反对美柬协定的报纸，逮捕反对美柬协定的编辑。人们不能不问：如果柬埔寨王国政府不顾广大人民的反对，坚持实施美柬协定；如果柬埔寨王国政府对柬埔寨人民对美柬协定的反对继续采取高压手段，那末，又有什么保证，今年九月的全国性选举会在“尊重基本自由的条件下”进行呢？一切爱好和平和决心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民，都要求柬埔寨王国政府尊重广大人民的愿望，按照日内瓦协议的规定，保持柬埔寨的中立地位，并使今年九月的全国选举能够真正在符合于尊重基本自由的条件下举行。
    一年来，柬埔寨国际委员会为维护日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的实施，进行了艰巨的工作，克服了种种困难，并取得了很大的成绩。人们相信柬埔寨国际委员会一定会继续努力，为日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的彻底实施作出进一步的贡献。
