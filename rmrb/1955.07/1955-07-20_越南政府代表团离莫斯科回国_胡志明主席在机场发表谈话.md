Dear Comrades and Friends!

The government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which visited the Soviet Union, has completed its mission and is setting off for home today.

We received sincere and warm hospitality in the Soviet Union, as if we were close brothers. We are deeply moved. On the eve of our departure, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for the warm feelings they have shown to us and the Vietnamese people.

We visited many great industrial and agricultural construction projects, the Moscow State University, and the Young Pioneers summer camp.

We are very pleased to note that the living standards of the Soviet people are increasing day by day, and the strength of the Soviet people is very powerful. They will undoubtedly be able to victoriously defend world peace and build communism with this strength.

We held talks with the Soviet government and reached a consensus on many international issues. We are determined to continue to develop the friendly relations between the people of our two countries in the future. The Soviet government and the Soviet people have expressed sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people in the past, and are now providing more concrete assistance to the Vietnamese people in their struggle to consolidate peace, achieve the unification of Vietnam, and achieve independence and democracy throughout the country. This selfless assistance further strengthens the confidence and strength of the Vietnamese people and promotes the completion of the great tasks we face in rapidly restoring the national economy, improving the people's living standards, and strengthening the people's strength.

We firmly believe that the cooperation between the people of Vietnam and the Soviet Union will be further strengthened from today onwards, and the unbreakable friendship between our two countries will become increasingly consolidated.

We once again express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for the sincere feelings they have shown to our delegation.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Vietnam and the Soviet Union!

Long live the Soviet Communist Party!

Long live the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace!

Long live world peace!
