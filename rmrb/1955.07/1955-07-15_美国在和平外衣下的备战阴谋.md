Title: U.S. Conspiracy for War Under the Guise of Peace

The situation in Asia has drawn close attention on the eve of the Four Power Conference. Here, as in other parts of the world, the efforts of the Asian people to strive for peace and stop war are being stubbornly resisted by the U.S. aggressive bloc. This resistance is carried out under the guise of peace, which is used to paralyze the vigilance of the world's people and public opinion.

U.S. officials have recently been constantly promoting that they also want peace, stating that "the United States will seek peace by all means." They claim that the U.S. is prepared to take a "sincere" attitude at the Four Power Conference. Eisenhower's disarmament advisor, Stassen, even advocated replacing "ultimatums, threats of war," and war with "methods of peacefully resolving differences between countries, such as direct negotiations and mediation." But even as these kinds of peaceful statements were being issued, the U.S. State Department and Department of Defense were busy creating tension in Asia and clamoring for war threats.

This U.S. attitude is particularly clear in the matter of easing the situation in the Taiwan area. More than two months ago, China proposed direct negotiations with the United States in order to ease the situation. This proposal was flatly rejected by the U.S. State Department from the outset. Subsequently, under pressure from public opinion, the U.S., while forced to abandon its attitude of outright refusal to negotiate, has consistently stated that it is only willing to negotiate with China on the so-called "ceasefire" issue, which is China's internal affair, and has tried its best to evade the substantive issue of easing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. In this way, the U.S. is still refusing to negotiate.

Over the past few months, there has been progress in the Asian situation. The Asian-African Conference greatly advanced the process of easing the situation. China has made many statements to ease the situation. Many countries concerned about peace have issued joint statements in mutual talks. For example, the Soviet-Indian and Soviet-Yugoslav joint statements both advocated satisfying China's legitimate desire for Taiwan and resolving international issues through negotiations.

However, the U.S. has remained unmoved. It refuses to negotiate with China.

In order to find an excuse for the U.S.'s refusal to negotiate, Dulles has recently repeatedly promoted that a "de facto ceasefire" has appeared in the Taiwan Strait, and that the situation there is "not as dangerous as it was a few months ago." Therefore, according to Dulles, the best way to deal with the Taiwan issue now is to "leave it alone," meaning to maintain the tension in Taiwan and not negotiate.

Dulles has his reasons for this propaganda and plan. For a long time, the U.S. plan to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group to invade the Chinese mainland has suffered countless setbacks. Therefore, it attempts to retreat in order to advance, temporarily contenting itself with creating the fact of "two Chinas," legitimizing the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, and making Taiwan a long-term U.S. military base. The so-called "de facto ceasefire" is intended to imply an absolutely impossible situation: that China has acquiesced to "two Chinas" and that negotiations are unnecessary. At the same time, this propaganda is of course also to cover up the U.S.'s escalating aggressive activities in the Taiwan area.

This is precisely the case. While spreading the air of a "de facto ceasefire" in Taiwan, the U.S. is promoting this as a "victory" for its "policy of strength," as if only if the U.S. further strengthens its pressure on China can the situation be further eased. Using this absurd argument as a smokescreen, the U.S. is tensely engaged in war preparations in the Taiwan area, carrying out war threats and provocations against the Chinese people.

According to a six-point plan to occupy Taiwan for a long time, the U.S. is actively strengthening the military power of the Chiang Kai-shek group. Under U.S. instigation and support, the Chiang Kai-shek group is frantically carrying out harassment activities. From May 1 to June 18, U.S.-made Chiang planes harassed and attacked the coastal and inland areas of mainland China in 579 sorties, totaling 1,118 aircraft. The Chiang bandit troops in Jinmen and Mazu and other places also constantly dispatched small armed bandits to land and harass. The Chiang bandit's so-called "guerrilla forces" on these two islands are receiving so-called "strict combat training" with the assistance of the U.S. intelligence agency "Western Enterprise Company" (this intelligence agency has now changed its name because it is too notorious). The U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek group have also formed a so-called "Guerrilla Command Center" to unify the command of harassment activities against the Chinese mainland.

At the same time, the U.S. is trying to turn Taiwan into its permanent base of aggression. The U.S. 13th Air Force has already established a task force headquarters in Taiwan. According to the "New York Times," "Taiwan has become a base that the U.S. Air Force can fully use." The U.S. air force units in Taiwan have increased to two squadrons and will continue to increase. The U.S. is studying the issue of stationing Marine Corps troops in Taiwan. U.S. military leaders constantly visit Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu to conduct war planning and deployment. The U.S. 7th Fleet continues to operate in the Taiwan Strait. In early July, it conducted a so-called "show of force" war exercise centered on the Penghu Islands, carrying out war provocations against the Chinese people.

While conducting these war preparations, the U.S. is also taking advantage of every opportunity and using all means to slander the Chinese people. It is clear that the U.S. aggressive bloc is attempting to use this slander to provoke the feelings of the Chinese people in order to realize its conspiracy to obstruct the easing of the situation in the Far East and to pin the responsibility for creating this situation on the Chinese people.

In order to be hostile to the Chinese people, the U.S.'s war preparations are also being carried out extensively in a vast area from Korea to the Middle East.

Korea is one of the three fronts of U.S. aggression against China. Here, the U.S. is actively strengthening the armed forces of the Syngman Rhee group. In the fiscal year beginning July 1 this year, the U.S. will use a huge sum of 710 million U.S. dollars to maintain Syngman Rhee's puppet rule and a huge army of more than 30 divisions. The U.S. has supplied the Syngman Rhee group with a large number of weapons and equipment. In order to be able to provide the Syngman Rhee group with "unrestricted arms assistance," the U.S. is trying its best to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, demanding the abolition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and wantonly slandering the Korean-Chinese side for violating the Armistice Agreement. This is part of the U.S.'s overall war plan in Asia. As early as March of this year, South Korea's Minister of National Defense, Sun Won-il, revealed that, according to the U.S. deployment, the Syngman Rhee group would be responsible for "opening a second battlefield" when the U.S. attacked the Chinese mainland from Taiwan.

The U.S.'s interference in Indochina and its activities to undermine peace in Indochina are already well-known. Disregarding the opposition of the Vietnamese people, the U.S. supports the Ngo Dinh Diem group in southern Vietnam, plotting to undermine the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the peaceful reunification of Vietnam through national elections, and attempting to permanently divide Vietnam. In order to turn southern Vietnam into a U.S. base of aggression, the U.S. is stepping up the equipment and training of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's army. The U.S. violated the Geneva Accords and signed a military aid agreement with Cambodia, and is building military bases and strategic highways in Cambodia. The U.S. is also plotting to sign a similar military aid agreement with Laos. It is also directing the Laotian Royal Army to launch a large-scale attack on the Laotian Resistance Forces, attempting to create tension on the eve of the Four Power Conference and to find an excuse for the U.S. to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to expand its interference in Indochina.

It should be pointed out that the recent incident of the Laotian Royal Army launching a large-scale attack on the Laotian Resistance Forces occurred just after the end of the military advisory meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization planned by the U.S., and it is by no means a chance coincidence. According to the United Press, the meeting discussed not only the issue of organizing the ground forces of the Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but also specifically discussed the issue of so-called "protecting" the three Indochinese countries. These activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization show that the U.S. is anxious to organize the ground forces of the Asian countries participating in this organization in order to use them and the U.S.'s so-called naval and air "strength" to intimidate other Asian countries and carry out aggression.

At the same time, the U.S. is also stepping up the organization of aggressive military blocs in the Middle East. The Turkey-Iraq Treaty planned by the U.S. is expanding. Pakistan has already expressed its decision to join the treaty. The U.S. is also preparing to drag Iran into this bloc in order to form a so-called "northern tier defense chain" aimed at the Soviet Union and China, so that the network of military bases built by the U.S. in the Far East and Europe can be linked into a complete encirclement of China and the Soviet Union.

This series of aggressive activities and war preparations carried out by the U.S. in the vast region of Asia seriously threatens the independence and security of Asian countries and makes the situation in Asia increasingly tense. Many responsible politicians in the world have already felt uneasy about this situation. They believe that the upcoming Four Power Conference should discuss the Far East issue in order to ease the situation in this region. The Soviet Union has repeatedly made this proposal. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu have recently expressed such views on different occasions. However, the U.S. disregards this universal demand from the world and attempts to obstruct the Four Power Conference from discussing the Far East issue. According to U.S. columnist Robert Allen, the U.S. has prepared a so-called "white paper" slandering the Korean-Chinese side for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement as a shield to refuse to discuss the Far East issue. The U.S.'s attitude clearly exposes that it does not want to ease the tension in the Far East, it does not want peace but wants war.

At the time when the Four Power Conference is about to be held, fair world public opinion must be vigilant against the U.S.'s conspiracy to intensify the tense situation hidden under the guise of peace. Upright public opinion has already played a practical role in defending peace. The power of public opinion may prompt the Four Power Conference to strive to ease the situation in Asia.

    美国在和平外衣下的备战阴谋
    蒋元椿
    在四大国会议前夕，亚洲地区的局势引起人们密切的注意。在这里，就像在世界其他地区一样，亚洲人民争取和平、制止战争的努力，正在遭到美国侵略集团的顽强抗拒。这种抗拒是在用来麻痹世界人民和舆论的警惕性的和平的外衣之下进行的。
    美国官方人物最近不断宣传他们也要和平，表示“美国将用一切方法谋求和平”。他们声称美国准备在四大国会议上采取“老老实实”的态度。艾森豪威尔的裁军顾问史塔生甚至主张用“和平解决国与国之间的分歧的方法，如直接谈判和调停”，代替“最后通牒、战争威胁”和战争。但是就在发出这一类和平言论的同时，美国国务院和国防部却忙于在亚洲制造紧张，叫嚣战争威胁。
    美国的这种态度特别清楚地表现在缓和台湾地区局势的问题上。中国在两个多月以前，为了和缓局势提出了同美国举行直接谈判的建议。这个建议一开始就被美国国务院一口拒绝了。其后，在舆论压力之下，美国虽然不得不放弃了断然拒绝谈判的态度，但是它始终表示只愿意和中国谈判属于中国内政的所谓“停火”问题，竭力回避缓和台湾紧张局势这个实质问题。这样，美国仍然是拒绝谈判。
    几个月来，亚洲局势是有了进展的。亚非会议大大地推进了缓和局势的进程。中国作了很多和缓局势的表示。不少关心和平的国家在相互的会谈中发表联合声明，例如苏印、苏南联合声明，都主张满足中国对台湾的合法权利的愿望，主张经过谈判来解决国际问题。
    但是，美国却在那里纹风不动。它不肯同中国谈判。
    为了给美国拒绝谈判找借口，杜勒斯最近一再宣传说在台湾海峡已经出现了什么“事实上的停火”，说什么那里的局势已经“不像几个月以前那样危险了”。因此，照杜勒斯的意见，现在对台湾问题最好的办法是“置之不理”，意思就是把台湾紧张局势保持在那里，不要谈判。
    杜勒斯的这种宣传和打算有他的原因。长期以来，美国要利用蒋贼集团侵犯中国大陆的计划受到了无数挫折。因此，它企图以退为进，想暂时满足于制造“两个中国”的事实，使美国侵占台湾合法化，使台湾成为美国长期的军事基地。所谓“事实上的停火”就是想要暗示一种绝对不可能发生的情况：中国已经默认了“两个中国”，谈判已无必要。同时，这种宣传当然也是为了掩盖美国对台湾地区的有加无已的侵略活动。
    事实也正是这样。美国一面散布台湾“事实上已经停火”的空气，一面宣传说这是美国“实力政策”的“胜利”，似乎只有美国更加加强它对中国的压力，局势才能进一步缓和。用这种荒唐论调作为烟幕，美国正在台湾地区紧张地从事着战争准备，对中国人民进行战争威胁和挑衅。
    根据一个长期侵占台湾的六点计划，美国积极加强蒋介石集团的军事力量。在美国指使和支持之下，蒋介石集团疯狂地进行骚扰活动。从五月一日到六月十八日，美制蒋机骚扰袭击中国大陆沿海和内陆达到五百七十九批，一千一百一十八架次。金门和马祖等地的蒋贼军也不断派遣小股武装匪徒登陆骚扰。在这两个岛上的蒋贼所谓“游击部队”正在美国特务机关“西方企业公司”（现在这个特务机关因为过于臭名昭著，已经改了名字了。）的协助下，进行所谓“严格的战斗训练”。美国和蒋介石集团并且组成了所谓“游击指挥中心”，来统一指挥对中国大陆的骚扰活动。
    同时，美国正在力图把台湾变成它的永久性的侵略基地。美国第十三航空队已经在台湾设立了特遣部队司令部。据“纽约时报”报道，“台湾已经成了一个美国空军完全可以使用的基地了”。美国在台湾的空军部队已经增加到两个中队，并且将继续增加。美国正在研究派海军陆战队驻扎在台湾的问题。美国的军事首脑不断访问台湾、金门和马祖，进行战争策划和布置。美国第七舰队继续在台湾海峡活动，它在七月初并且以澎湖列岛为中心进行了所谓“显示力量”的战争演习，对中国人民进行战争挑衅。
    和进行这种备战活动同时，美国还利用一切机会、使用各种手段对中国人民大肆诬蔑。很明显，美国侵略集团企图用这种诬蔑来挑拨中国人民的感情，以便它实现阻挠远东局势缓和的阴谋，并把造成这种局面的责任硬推在中国人民身上。
    为了同中国人民为敌，美国的备战活动同时也在从朝鲜一直到中东的广大地区内广泛地进行。
    朝鲜是美国侵略中国的三条战线之一。在这里，美国正在积极加强李承晚集团的武装力量。从今年七月一日开始的会计年度内，美国将以七亿一千万美元的巨款来维持李承晚的傀儡统治和一支三十多个师的庞大军队。美国已经供给了李承晚集团大批的武器和装备。为了能够给予李承晚集团“不受限制的武器援助”，美国竭力企图破坏朝鲜停战协定，要求取消中立国监察委员会，并且大肆诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定。这是美国在亚洲的全面战争计划的一部分。早在今年三月间，南朝鲜的国防部长官孙元一就曾经透露，按照美国的布置，李承晚集团将在美国从台湾进攻中国大陆时担负“开辟第二战场”的任务。
    美国对印度支那的干涉和破坏印度支那和平的活动已经是众所周知的事情。美国不顾越南人民的反对，在越南南部支持吴庭艳集团，阴谋破坏日内瓦协议中关于通过全国选举来实现越南和平统一的规定，企图长期分裂越南。为了把越南南部变成美国的侵略基地，美国正在加紧装备和训练吴庭艳集团的军队。美国违反日内瓦协议，和柬埔寨签订了军事援助协定，并在柬埔寨修建军事基地和战略公路。美国还阴谋同老挝签订同样的军事援助协定。它还在指使老挝王国军队大举进攻寮国抗战部队，企图在四大国会议前夕制造紧张局势，并为美国利用东南亚集团扩大干涉印度支那寻找借口。
    应当指出，最近发生的老挝王国军队大举进攻寮国抗战部队的事件，发生在美国所策划的东南亚集团的军事顾问会议刚刚结束的时候，完全不是偶然的巧合。据合众社透露，在这次会议上不但讨论了组织东南亚集团的地面部队问题，而且特别讨论了所谓“保护”印度支那三国的问题。东南亚集团的这些活动表明：美国正在急于组织参加这个集团的亚洲国家的地面部队，以便凭着它们和美国的所谓海空“实力”恫吓其他亚洲国家，进行侵略。
    与此同时，美国在中东地区也在加紧组织侵略性的军事集团。美国所策划的土耳其——伊拉克条约正在扩大。巴基斯坦已经表示决定参加这个条约。美国还准备把伊朗也拖进这个集团，以便组成一条针对苏联和中国的所谓“北层防御锁链”，使美国在远东和欧洲构筑的军事基地网连结成一个对中、苏的完整的包围圈。
    美国在亚洲广大地区所进行的这一系列侵略活动和战争准备，严重地威胁了亚洲国家的独立和安全，并且使亚洲的局势日趋紧张。世界的许多负责的政治家们已经对这种局势感到不安。他们认为即将举行的四大国会议应该讨论远东问题，以便缓和这个地区的局势。苏联曾经多次提出这种主张。印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸总理吴努最近都在不同的场合表示了这样的意见。但是美国却不顾全世界这种普遍的要求，企图竭力阻挠四大国会议讨论远东问题。据美国专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦透露，美国为此已经准备了一份诬蔑朝中方面违反朝鲜停战协定的所谓“白皮书”，作为拒绝讨论远东问题的挡箭牌。美国的这种态度明显地暴露了它不想缓和远东的紧张局势，不要和平而要战争。
    在四大国会议将要举行的时候，世界公正舆论必须警惕美国这种隐藏在和平外衣下面的加剧紧张局势的阴谋。正直的舆论已经在保卫和平方面起了实际的作用。舆论的力量将可能促使四大国会议为和缓亚洲的局势而努力。
