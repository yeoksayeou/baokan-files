Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 22nd (TASS dispatch): The German News Agency reported that the head of the Observer Delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic in Geneva, State Secretary Hanke, made a statement to representatives of German Democratic Radio regarding the Four-Power Conference.

Hanke pointed out: The ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements are making the issue of security a major concern for the people of all European countries. The West German policy of reviving the "Bundeswehr" is making the issue of German reunification completely different. The policy of rearmament places the German people in a very difficult position.

Hanke then pointed out that the solution to the German question has two aspects: on the international front, the four governments need to agree to the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis; and on the domestic front, this is only related to the Germans themselves. He emphasized that the Geneva Conference has once again made it clearest that it is impossible to solve the German question without the Germans themselves.

Referring to the Soviet Union's proposal on reunifying Germany and establishing a European collective security system, Hanke believes that the Soviet government's主張 (zhǔzhāng - assertion/proposition) is pragmatic, in line with the interests of the German people, and conducive to restoring Germany's unification in accordance with the principles of peace and democracy.

Regarding the question of whether the Government of the German Democratic Republic has specific plans for reunifying Germany, Hanke gave an affirmative answer. He said, "We believe that Germany will not be reunified until the Germans themselves reach an agreement. The purpose of our government's policy is first and foremost to achieve mutual understanding between the two parts of Germany." Hanke also expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference will make corresponding decisions that can promote mutual understanding between East and West and strengthen the pan-German struggle for peaceful reunification.

    民主德国政府观察员代表团团长发表谈话
    希望四国会议作出加强全德争取和平统一的相应的决议
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：德意志通讯社报道，在日内瓦的德意志民主共和国政府观察员代表团团长、国务秘书韩克向德国民主电台的代表发表了关于四大国会议的谈话。
    韩克指出：巴黎协定的批准和实施正在使安全问题成为欧洲各国人民的主要问题。西德复活“国防军”的政策使得德国重新统一的问题变得完全不同了。重新武装政策使德国人处在一个非常困难的地位。
    韩克接着指出，德国问题的解决有两个方面，在国际方面，需要四国政府赞同德国在民主和和平的基础上重新统一；而在国内方面，这只是和德国人自己有关。他着重指出，日内瓦会议已再一次最清楚地表明，撇开德国人自己是不可能解决德国问题的。
    提到苏联关于重新统一德国和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议时，韩克认为，苏联政府的主张是实事求是的，是符合德国人民的利益的，而且有助于根据和平和民主的方针恢复德国的统一。
    对于德意志民主共和国政府是否有重新统一德国的具体计划的问题，韩克作了肯定的答复。他说，我们认为，德国人本身之间一天不达成协议，德国就一天不会重新统一。我们政府的政策的目的首先是取得德国两部分之间的彼此谅解。韩克并且表示希望，日内瓦会议将作出能够促进东西方之间的共同谅解和加强全德争取和平统一的相应的决定。
