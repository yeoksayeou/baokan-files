　　Ten irrigation experiment stations have been established in the western Sichuan Plain. These irrigation experiment stations were established successively by the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Department starting in 1953. The task of these experiment stations is to help farmers find out the water requirements of rice and correct irrigation systems, so as to achieve scientific water use, improve soil, and increase rice yield per unit area.
    Last year, based on their own field experiments and summaries of farmers' irrigation experience, these stations proposed water use methods such as "new method of soaking fields" and "shallow water irrigation," requiring farmers to use them. This year, these experiment stations organized 195 observation demonstrations of the above two scientific irrigation methods, and paddy fields adopting these two water use methods reached more than 363,000 mu.
    In the past, farmers in the western Sichuan Plain have always used unreasonable irrigation methods such as deep irrigation and flooding, which caused great waste of water and a large loss of fertilizer in the fields, creating a bad living environment for rice growth and affecting yield. The "new method of soaking fields" and "shallow water irrigation" can overcome these shortcomings.

### 川西平原建立十个灌溉试验站

　　川西平原建立十个灌溉试验站
    川西平原已经建立了十个灌溉试验站。这些灌溉试验站是四川省水利厅从一九五三年开始陆续建立起来的。这些试验站的任务是帮助农民找出水稻需水规律和正确灌溉制度，从而达到科学用水、改良土壤、提高水稻单位面积产量。
    这些站去年根据自己的田间试验和总结农民的灌溉经验，曾提出了水稻的“新法泡田”和“浅水灌溉”等用水方法，要农民运用。今年这些试验站组织了上述两种科学灌溉方法的观摩示范一百九十五次，采用这两种用水方法的稻田达三十六万三千多亩。
    过去，川西平原农民一向沿用着深灌、漫灌等不合理的灌溉方法，造成了水量上的极大浪费和田内肥料的大量流失，给水稻生长造成恶劣的生活环境，影响了产量。“新法泡田”和“浅水灌溉”，可以克服这些缺点。　（新华社）
