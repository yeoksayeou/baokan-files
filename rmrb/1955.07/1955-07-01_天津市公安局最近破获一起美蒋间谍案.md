　　Tianjin Public Security Bureau Recently Uncovered a US-Chiang Spy Case

　　The Tianjin Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a spy case involving agents dispatched by the US-Chiang special service organization "Sino-American Joint Office" (referred to as "Lian Gong Chu"). It successively arrested, according to law, Ye Shixiang, the "secret liaison" dispatched by "Lian Gong Chu" to Tianjin to contact the main culprits, Mao Banhou and Zhao Shuxian, the main culprits dispatched by "Lian Gong Chu" to infiltrate Tianjin, and Fu Mingqin, who was responsible for covering up the main culprits. Evidence of espionage activities was seized on the spot, including a secret letter of instruction from "Lian Gong Chu" to the main culprit Mao Banhou, a US-made special agent motor, a telecommunications contact card, and two rolls of microdot film.

　　During the interrogation of the criminals in this case, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau confirmed that the main culprit Mao Banhou and his wife Zhao Shuxian had separately received "all-around intelligence" training from US intelligence agencies in Japan and Taiwan. Under the cover of Zhao's mother, Fu Mingqin, they formed an independent intelligence group and, in 1950, accepted the mission assigned by the US-Chiang special service organization "Sino-American Joint Office" to infiltrate Tianjin and engage in the criminal activities of establishing a radio station and collecting our military and political intelligence. The criminal Ye Shixiang served as the "secret liaison" between the command organs of the "Lian Gong Chu" and the criminal Mao Banhou.

　　The main culprit Mao Banhou's English code name in "Lian Gong Chu" was HUGH, his Chinese alias was Mao Jingcheng, and his current public alias is Mao Chengyuan. He is 31 years old, a native of Jimo, Shandong, and resides at 29 Fujian Road, 6th District, Tianjin. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he received intelligence training from US-Chiang spy agencies twice in the then-Chiang-controlled areas. After Japan surrendered, Mao was assigned to the Chiang bandit Qingdao Police Bureau to engage in open anti-people activities. Before the liberation of Qingdao in February 1949, Mao and his wife Zhao Shuxian (current alias Zhao Feng, 26 years old, a native of Yantai, Shandong, address as above), and mother-in-law Fu Mingqin (62 years old, a native of Yantai, Shandong, address as above) fled to Taiwan.

　　According to the confessions of the main culprits Mao Banhou and Zhao Shuxian, as early as 1949, the US Central Intelligence Agency and Chiang’s "Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau" re-established a new joint intelligence agency and began espionage and sabotage activities against New China. Mao and Zhao were successively selected by this spy agency at the end of 1949 and received new technical training. The main culprit Mao Banhou confessed that in August 1949, in Taipei, Taiwan Province, a US agent who called himself "Mage," with the assistance of the "Security Bureau," selected special agents above the rank of captain to go to Japan to receive "all-around intelligence" training, and then sent them back to the mainland to engage in infiltration activities. Mao was one of those selected. Mao and his party flew to Yokosuka, Japan, on September 1, 1949, and entered the Yokosuka "All-Around Intelligence Officer Training Class" sponsored by the US spy agency. They began training on September 6 and completed the training on June 6, 1950. This "training class" was extremely secret. All the instructors and staff were Americans or American citizens. The training content included "Intelligence Studies" and "Telecommunications Studies," etc., with the aim of training a group of intermediate-level "all-around intelligence officers," that is, intelligence officers who could conduct intelligence activities themselves and also carry out telecommunications liaison. The US agents teaching in this training class included "Mage" and eight others, most of whom had engaged in long-term espionage activities in our country. Criminal Zhao Shuxian confessed that while Mao was receiving training, she was selected and transferred to the "Neihu Special Training Class in Taiwan," which was a large-scale "all-around intelligence officer" training class supported by US agents and organized by Chiang's "Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau." The instructors were all senior agents of the "Security Bureau," and the training content also included subjects such as "Intelligence Studies" and "Telecommunications Studies," cultivating backbone agents for elementary "all-around intelligence."

　　After Mao and Zhao completed their training, they were distributed and dispatched by the aforementioned US agent "Mage" and another US agent who called himself "Lan," with the assistance of the "Security Bureau." US agent "Mage" instructed Mao and others to infiltrate the mainland and remain in Tianjin for a long time under the guise of business, establish a secret radio station, and collect our intelligence, especially focusing on collecting our military intelligence, in preparation for the US-Chiang to launch a new war of aggression in the future. At the same time as receiving the mission, Mao and others received an activity fund of US$3,500 for 1950, a US-made special agent motor, two rolls of microdot film, and a contact card, and stipulated that their monthly salary would be US$80 in the future. After accepting the mission, Mao and Zhao, together with Fu Mingqin, who was responsible for covering them, arrived in Hong Kong from Taiwan in July 1950 and infiltrated Tianjin in November of the same year.

　　After Mao and others arrived in Tianjin, according to the arrangement of the US agents, they mainly carried out "identity cover" for several years in order to remain infiltrated for a long time. In 1952, "Lian Gong Chu" secretly transported the special agent motor for Mao to Tianjin, disguised in a cargo box, and handed it over to Mao. In 1954, "Lian Gong Chu" again sent "secret liaison" Ye Shixiang (also known as Ye Sanmao, male, 42 years old, a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, residing at No. 5, Lane 131, Catholic Street, Shanghai, a crew member of the "Hubei Wheel" before his arrest) to establish secret contact with Mao by taking advantage of his frequent trips between Hong Kong and Tianjin, instructing Mao to carry out intelligence activities and set up a station for reporting. At this time, Mao and others believed that after a long period of disguise, it was enough to deceive the eyes and ears of the people, so in August 1954, they began to set up a station to communicate with "Lian Gong Chu," reporting their activities and sending out important intelligence. Not long ago, when "Lian Gong Chu" again sent criminal Ye Shixiang to Tianjin with a secret letter instructing Mao to strengthen intelligence activities, it was detected and uncovered by our Public Security Bureau.

　　Now, the investigation work of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau on this case has come to an end, and the case will be transferred to the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate according to law, and a public prosecution will be filed with the Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court.

　　天津市公安局最近破获一起美蒋间谍案
    天津市公安局不久以前破获了美蒋特务机关 “中美联合办公处”（简称“联公处”）派遣的间谍特务案件一起，依法先后逮捕了“联公处”派遣到天津和主犯进行联络的“秘密交通员”叶世祥、“联公处”派遣潜伏天津市的主犯——毛班侯、赵淑贤及负责掩护主犯的傅鸣琴等四人。当场搜获间谍活动的罪证有“联公处”给主犯毛班侯的密写指示函件一件、美制特工电机一部以及电讯联络卡片一份、密底码胶卷两卷。
    天津市公安局在对这一案各犯进行侦讯中证实：主犯毛班侯及其妻赵淑贤曾分别在日本、台湾受过美国情报机关的“全能情报”训练。他们在赵母傅鸣琴参加掩护下，组成了一个独立的情报小组，在一九五○年受领了美蒋特务机关“中美联合办公处”的派遣任务，潜入天津从事建立电台、搜集我军政情报的罪恶活动。叶犯世祥则是担任“联公处”的指挥机关同毛犯班侯联络的“秘密交通员”。
    主犯毛班侯在“联公处”的英文代号是HUGH，中文代名是毛敬诚，现用公开化名毛承远，现年三十一岁，山东即墨人，住天津市六区福建路二十九号。远在抗日战争期间，他就两度在当时蒋贼统治区受过美蒋间谍特务机关的情报训练。日本投降后，毛犯被派到蒋贼青岛警察局任职，进行公开的反人民活动。一九四九年二月青岛解放前，毛犯同其妻赵淑贤（现用化名赵枫，年二十六岁，山东烟台人，住址同前）、岳母傅鸣琴（六十二岁，山东烟台人，住址同前）等逃往台湾。
    据主犯毛班侯和赵淑贤的口供证实：远在一九四九年，美国中央情报局就和蒋贼的“国防部保密局”重新成立了新的联合情报机构，开始了对新中国的间谍破坏活动。毛、赵二犯在一九四九年底相继被这个间谍特务机构选中并受到了新的技术训练。主犯毛班侯供认：一九四九年八月，在台湾省台北市有一自称“麦琪”（Mage）的美国特务在“保密局”协助下，选派上尉级以上的特工人员到日本受“全能情报”训练，然后派回大陆潜伏活动，毛犯是中选的一个。毛犯等一行在一九四九年九月一日飞抵日本横须贺，入了美国特务机关主办的横须贺“全能情报员训练班”，九月六日开始接受训练，到一九五○年六月六日受训期满。这个“训练班”是极端秘密的，班内所有的教官和工作人员都是美国人或美籍人，训练的内容包括“情报学”、“电讯学”等，其目的在于训练一批中级的“全能情报员”，即自己能够进行情报活动，也能进行电讯联络的情报员。在这个训练班里执教的美国特务有
  “麦琪”等八人，他们大都在我国进行过长期的间谍活动。赵犯淑贤供认：在毛犯受训同时，她被选调到“台湾内湖特训班”受训，这是一个由美国特务支持而由蒋贼“国防部保密局”负责组织的大型的“全能情报员”训练班，教官均由“保密局”的高级特务担任，训练内容也包括“情报学”、“电讯学”等课目，培养的是初等“全能情报”的骨干特务。
    毛、赵二犯受训结束后，即由前述的美国特务“麦琪”和另一自称“兰”（Lan）的美国特务在
  “保密局”的协助下进行了分发派遣。美国特务“麦琪”指令毛犯等以经商为掩护，潜入大陆并长期潜伏天津，建立秘密电台，搜集我方情报，尤其着重搜集我方的军事情报，以为美蒋日后发动新的侵略战争作准备。毛犯等在受领任务同时，领到一九五○年度活动经费三千五百美元，美制特工电机一部，密底码胶卷二卷和联络卡片一张，并规定以后每月薪金为八十元美金。接受任务后，毛、赵二犯便同负责掩护他们的傅鸣琴一起，在一九五○年七月由台湾抵达香港，同年十一月潜入天津。
    毛犯等到天津后，按照美国特务的布置，几年来，主要进行了“身份的掩护”，以求长期潜伏下来。一九五二年，“联公处”把给毛犯的特工电机伪装在货箱里秘密运到天津，交给毛犯。一九五四年“联公处”又派“秘密交通员”叶世祥（又名叶三毛，男，四十二岁，浙江宁波人，住上海天主教街一三一弄五号，被捕前充“湖北轮”船员）借经常往来香港、天津之便，同毛犯建立了秘密联络，指令毛犯开展情报活动和架台通报。这时，毛犯等自以为经过了长期的伪装，足以瞒过人民的耳目，便在一九五四年八月开始和“联公处”架台通报，报告了他们的活动情况，并发出了重要的情报。不久以前，“联公处”再度派遣叶犯世祥携带指示毛犯加强情报活动的密写函件到天津时，被我公安局侦悉破获。
    现在，天津市公安局对该案的侦讯工作已告结束，即将依法将该案移送天津市人民检察院，并向天津市高级人民法院提起公诉。
