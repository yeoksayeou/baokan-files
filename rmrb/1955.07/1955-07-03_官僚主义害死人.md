"Bureaucracy Kills People" Editor:

　　The serious bureaucracy of the administrative leaders of the Tangshan Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine caused the electrocution death of worker Chen Yongzhen.

　　The trolley wire of the trolley yard (where workers get on and off the trolley) in the 7th lane of the underground transport roadway of the Tangshan Mine was too low and did not comply with safety regulations. The National Technical Safety Inspection Group suggested that the administrative side solve this problem as early as July 1954. After an accident in which a mule was electrocuted on September 9 of the same year, they suggested again, but the administrative leaders did not pay attention to it.

　　Before the Spring Festival overhaul period in January this year, the inspection group, the health section, and the trade union jointly inspected safety and health work and raised this issue again. However, Guo Qingxi, the deputy director of the mine office, used the excuse that "the overhaul plan has already been made" to shelve the issue.

　　On January 19th and February 15th, workers An Yuqing and Sun Jiyao were electrocuted in succession (fortunately, neither of them died). The inspection group and the trade union successively put forward written suggestions, and the labor protection minister of the trade union also raised this issue at the safety production meeting on March 9th. Only then did the administrative side make a decision at the meeting without any urgency, saying that Yu Zicheng, the head of the transportation area, would be responsible for organizing the inspection, drafting a plan, and gradually making baffles.

　　This decision was delayed. After the Kailuan Coal Mine Management Office discovered this problem, it instructed the Tangshan Mine on April 21st to "immediately install protective equipment" and "take measures to maintain the locations where the cross-section of the roadway is compressed too low." The next day, the inspection group followed up with another suggestion. However, the mine was still indifferent, and it was not until the safety production meeting on May 11th that a resolution was made, saying that "anti-electrocution devices should be installed in the underground yard, and Kang Baoli (chief of the electromechanical section) will be responsible for studying this with Mine Director Bi."

　　In addition, at the end of April, in order to improve transportation capacity, the mine increased the edges of the original small coal carts (which were also used for people to ride in) by 50 to 75 millimeters. As a result, workers were more likely to touch the wires when getting on and off the carts. The electromechanical department of the general management office raised objections to this matter, but the administrative leaders of the mine ignored them.

　　The problem could not be solved for a long time, which aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. Some people commented: "The problem cannot be solved unless someone dies." Sure enough, in the middle of the night on May 24th, electromechanical worker Chen Yongzhen was unfortunately electrocuted to death when getting on the cart in the yard. Only then did the leaders realize the seriousness of the problem and hurriedly nailed the wire baffles together the day after the accident.

　　Why did the administrative leaders of the Tangshan Mine turn a blind eye to the previous accidents and treat the correct opinions put forward by all parties as mere whispers in the wind? Why did they only wake up after a death occurred? "Bureaucracy kills people!" They should be held responsible for the death of Chen Yongzhen. We demand that the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office and the relevant leading organs of Tangshan City seriously deal with this incident.

### “官僚主义害死人”

　　“官僚主义害死人”编辑同志：
    开滦煤矿唐山矿行政领导人员的严重官僚主义，造成了工人陈永珍触电死亡事故。
    唐山矿井下运输大巷七道行二十二号石门电车场子（工人上下车的地方）的电车天线太低，不合保安规程。国家技术安全监察组早在一九五四年七月就建议行政方面解决这个问题，同年九月九日发生了一头骡子被电死的事故后又再次建议解决，都没有引起行政领导的重视。
    今年一月春节检修期前，监察组、卫生科和工会共同检查安全卫生工作时，又将这个问题提出来。但是矿办公室副主任郭庆玺用“检修计划已经作出”为理由，把这个问题搁下了。
    一月十九日和二月十五日，连续发生了工人安玉清和孙继耀触电事故（幸而都没有死亡）。监察组和工会又先后提出了书面建议，工会劳保部长在三月九日的安全生产会议上也提出这个问题。行政方面这才在会上作出了一个毫不着急的决议，说是由运输区区长郁子成负责组织检查，拟出计划，逐步做好挡板。
    这个决议迟迟不见执行。开滦煤矿管理处发现了这个问题后，在四月二十一日指示唐山矿“立即安装防护设备”和“采取措施及时维护该石门所用断面被压缩过低的地点”。第二天监察组接着又提出一次建议。但是矿上仍然满不在乎，到五月十一日的安全生产会议上才作出一项决议，说是“在井下车场安装防止触电装置，由康宝立（机电科长）负责与毕矿长研究”。
    另外，在四月底，矿方为了提高运输能力，将原有的小煤车（也是坐人的小车）车沿加高了五十至七十五公厘。这样一来，工人上下车时就更容易碰到电线了。总管理处的机电处对这件事曾提出意见，可是矿行政领导方面却没理睬。
    这件事老不能解决，引起了工人群众的不满。有人议论：“非死一个人不能解决问题。”果然，五月二十四日半夜里，机电工人陈永珍在车场上车时不幸触电身死；这时，领导上才感到问题严重，连忙在事故发生后的第二天，把电线的挡板钉齐。
    为什么唐山矿的行政领导人员对过去发生的历次事故都是视而不见，对各方面提出的正确意见也都当作耳边风；非要等到发生死亡事故才能清醒起来呢？“官僚主义害死人”！他们对陈永珍的死应该负责。我们要求开滦煤矿总管理处和唐山市有关领导机关严肃处理这个事件。
