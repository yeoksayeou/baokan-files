Advanced Experiences and Advanced Producers

　　Steam Blowing
　　Shi Youguang

　　Steam blowing refers to adding water vapor to the hot air blown into iron-smelting blast furnaces, and is also known as humidified blowing. This is an advanced experience from Soviet iron-smelting blast furnace production. Currently, seven blast furnaces in Anshan, Benxi, and Beijing in our country have adopted this advanced experience. After a blast furnace in Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) adopted steam blowing, its daily output increased by 5 percent, and coke consumption decreased by 1.3 percent. Now, the wind temperature for smelting steelmaking pig iron in this blast furnace has reached a maximum of 860 degrees, an increase of about 150 degrees compared to before, while the furnace condition remains stable. Although a blast furnace in Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has limited equipment conditions, the output increase after adopting steam blowing is not significant. However, because steam is used to adjust the furnace condition, the wind temperature rarely fluctuates, and the furnace condition is very stable, thus reducing coke consumption.

　　Adopting steam blowing can strengthen the smelting process of the blast furnace, increase the output of pig iron, and also reduce the consumption of fuel, which accounts for the major part of the cost of pig iron, by 3 to 7 percent, thus greatly reducing the cost of pig iron. If all the iron-smelting blast furnaces in the country adopt steam blowing and achieve the same results as Angang, the country can save more than 5 million yuan a year. At the same time, steam blowing can also promote the smooth flow of raw materials in the blast furnace and shorten the smelting time for each furnace of iron. Therefore, promoting steam blowing in blast furnace production is an important guarantee for the iron and steel industry to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

　　Cement Clay Mortar

　　Many construction units have replaced cement lime mortar with cement clay mortar in wall construction projects, and have achieved good results. In the first five months of using cement clay mortar at the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, it has already saved the country more than 10,000 yuan in investment. This year, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's Third Company has fully adopted cement clay mortar instead of cement lime mortar. According to preliminary calculations, the cost can be saved by more than 1.10 yuan per cubic meter of building area.

　　Using cement clay mortar can not only save a lot of lime and reduce construction costs, but also save a lot of manpower because the bonding force of cement clay mortar is very strong, which can avoid watering and troweling.

　　Due to the different soil qualities in different places, the ratio of raw materials for preparing cement clay mortar is not exactly the same. The preparation method is to first put a certain proportion of clean water, cement, loess, and sand into a mortar mixer for mixing, and store the mixed mortar in a slurry pool. If it is left in the pool for a long time, water will seep out on the surface. It must be stirred well before taking it, so that the consistency of the mortar is maintained between 7 cm and 10 cm to ensure the quality of the mortar.

　　The following issues should be paid attention to when preparing cement clay mortar: 1. When using clay, the surface layer of soil must be removed. 2. Hard lumps and impurities in the clay should be sieved out to reduce mixing time. 3. The clay used must be tested regularly, because the composition of the soil quality often varies greatly in places not far apart, so the composition of the soil quality must be accurately tested to ensure the quality of the prepared mortar.

　　先进经验和先进生产者
　　蒸汽鼓风
　　时有光
    蒸汽鼓风就是在向炼铁高炉鼓入的热风中加水蒸汽，所以也叫加湿鼓风。这是苏联炼铁高炉生产中的先进经验。目前，在我国的鞍山、本溪、北京三地，已有七座炼铁高炉推行了这个先进经验。鞍钢某高炉采用蒸汽鼓风后，日产量提高了百分之五，焦炭的消耗量降低了百分之一点三，现在这个高炉冶炼制钢生铁的风温最高用到八百六十度，较以前提高了一百五十度左右，而炉况还是平稳的。北京石景山钢铁厂某高炉虽然受到设备条件的限制，采用蒸汽鼓风后，产量提高得并不显著，但由于用蒸汽调剂了炉况，风温很少变动，炉况非常稳定，因而降低了焦炭的消耗量。
    采用蒸汽鼓风可以强化高炉的冶炼过程，提高生铁的产量，还可以使占生铁成本主要部分的燃料的消耗量降低百分之三至百分之七，因而就可以大大地降低生铁的成本。如果全国的炼铁高炉都采用蒸汽鼓风，并收到与鞍钢同样的效果，全年约可给国家节约五百万元以上。同时，蒸汽鼓风也可以促进高炉内的原料行程顺利，缩短每炉铁的冶炼时间。因此，在高炉生产中推行蒸汽鼓风，是炼铁工业完成和超额完成国家计划的一项重要保证。
　　水泥黏土砂浆
　　霍学光
    不少建筑单位在砌墙工程上以水泥黏土砂浆代替水泥石灰砂浆，收到了很好的效果。第一汽车制造厂工地开始使用水泥黏土砂浆的最初五个月中，已给国家节省了投资一万多元。今年西北工程管理总局第三公司全面采用了水泥黏土砂浆代替水泥石灰砂浆，据初步计算，每立方公尺的建筑面积就能节省费用一元一角多。
    使用水泥黏土砂浆不仅可以大量节省石灰，降低建筑成本，而且由于水泥黏土砂浆的黏结力很强，可以避免浇水括斗，还能节约很多人力。
    由于各地的土质不同，配制水泥黏土砂浆的原料比例也不完全一样。配制办法是先将一定比例的净水、水泥、黄土和砂放在砂浆搅拌机内搅拌，将搅拌好的砂浆储放在浆池中。如果在池内放的时间较久，表面就要泌水，取用时必须先搅拌好，使砂浆的稠度保持在七公分至十公分之间，才能保证砂浆的质量。
    配制水泥黏土砂浆时应注意以下几个问题：一、用黏土时必须把表面一层土去掉。二、应筛去黏土中的硬块和杂物，以减少搅拌时间。三、采用黏土必须经常化验，因土质的成份往往在相隔不远的地方差别就很大，所以必须把土质的成份化验准确，配制出来的砂浆才能保证质量。
