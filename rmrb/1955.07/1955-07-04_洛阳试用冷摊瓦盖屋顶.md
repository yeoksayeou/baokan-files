　　Luoyang Tries Cold-laid Tiled Roofs
    Based on the suggestion of Soviet experts, the newly built worker dormitories in Luoyang, Henan this year will all use cold-laid tiles. Cold-laid tiles means only using tiles on the roof for rain protection, omitting the tar paper and roof sheathing underneath. According to design requirements, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau Materials Testing Institute began the first artificial rainfall test on cold-laid tiles in January. The test results showed that there were leaks at the joints between the tiles, requiring improvements to the tile model. It has now been successfully tested. It was decided to deepen the water channel of the tile and widen the raised tile back, and change the joint between the two tiles from a single groove to a double groove. The testing institute has now drawn up the blueprints.
    The use of cold-laid tiles is a new reform in construction engineering. This single item can reduce construction costs by 2.4 yuan per square meter of construction. More importantly, it can save some major building materials. The saved tar paper can be used for factory building and other aspects; tar paper is made of asphalt and mica. If the country uses less tar paper, it can save asphalt for road repairs, etc., and save mica for use as refractory materials. In addition, without laying tar paper, there is no need for roof sheathing, which can save 3,000 cubic meters of wood per 100,000 square meters of construction area.
    In addition, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau Materials Testing Institute has also trial-produced a light concrete skeleton wall panel (also known as a partition wall). This wall panel is learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, using cement, clay, broken bricks, yellow sand, and sawdust to make the partition walls on the first floor; using cement, clay, shavings, and sawdust to make the partition walls on the second and third floors. In this way, the project cost per square meter can be saved by 1.6 yuan compared to using double-sided wood strip partitions. According to the Luoyang Engineering Bureau's project volume this year, it can save the country about 248,000 yuan; at the same time, it can also save a lot of wood and save painting time, and the sound insulation is better than wood strip partitions.

### 洛阳试用冷摊瓦盖屋顶

　  洛阳试用冷摊瓦盖屋顶
    根据苏联专家的建议，河南洛阳今年新建的工人宿舍将全部采用冷摊瓦。冷摊瓦就是在屋顶上只用瓦片遮雨，省去下边铺的油毛毡和屋面板。洛阳工程局材料试验所根据设计要求，在一月间就开始在冷摊瓦上作第一次人工降雨的试验。试验结果，发现瓦片和瓦片接口地方漏水，需要改进瓦的模型。目前已经试验成功。决定瓦的流水槽子要加深，凸起的瓦背要加宽，两瓦的结合缝由单槽改为双槽子。现在试验所已经绘出图纸。
    采用冷摊瓦是建筑工程中一项新的改革，每平方公尺建筑只这一项就可以降低工程造价二元四角。更重要的是可以节约一些主要的建筑材料。节约下的油毛毡可用于厂房建筑和其它方面；油毛毡又是用沥青和云母制成的，国家少用油毛毡就可以节约下来沥青用去修马路等，节约下云母可作耐火材料。另外，不铺油毛毡，也就不需要屋面板了，每十万平方公尺建筑面积就可以节约三千立方公尺木材。
    另外，洛阳工程局材料试验所又试制了一种轻混凝土骨架墙板（也称隔墙）。这种墙板是学习苏联的先进经验，用水泥、黏土、碎砖、黄沙和锯末等材料制成第一层楼隔墙；用水泥、黏土、刨花和锯末等材料制成第二和第三层楼隔墙。这样可以使每平方公尺的工程造价比用双面木板条隔墙节省一元六角。根据洛阳工程局今年工程量计算可以给国家节省约二十四万八千元；同时，还能大量节约木材和节省粉刷时间，隔音也比木板条隔墙要好。
