    West Germany—A Formidable Rival in the Capitalist World Market
    Pan Fei
    Before the war, German imperialism was a stubborn opponent of American, British, and French capitalism in the struggle for sales markets. After the end of the Second World War, the monopoly giants of Western European countries attempted to take advantage of Germany's defeat to eliminate this formidable competitor. Indeed, in the first few years after the war, West Germany was almost completely excluded from the capitalist world market, and its exports were reduced to negligible levels. However, the situation soon changed. Today, West German monopoly capital has once again become a formidable rival in the capitalist world market, seriously threatening the position of Britain and France in this market, and even threatening the United States in some regions.
    In the short span of ten years, what fundamentally changed West Germany's position, and enabled the Ruhr giants to climb back up after their disastrous defeat to engage in competition and economic expansion, was the US imperialist policy towards Germany. The US ruling clique's policy of reviving German militarism inevitably led to the rapid restoration of the former status of West German monopoly capital. Just as after the "Treaty of Versailles" the United States used the "Dawes Plan" to support German monopoly capital, after the Second World War, Washington invested billions of dollars in West German trusts through the "Marshall Plan." It is not difficult to understand why West Germany, as a defeated country, recovered its economy faster than its Western European partners in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.
    What is enough to illustrate West Germany's economic face today is that trusts and concerns are once again playing an important role in West Germany's political and economic life. The concentration of capital in West Germany after the war even exceeded the pre-war scale. Seven metallurgical concerns concentrated 79 percent of West Germany's steel production. In coal mining, fifteen companies concentrated 82 percent of West Germany's coal production. Another figure illustrating West Germany's economic situation is the rapid increase in industrial production. West German industrial production exceeded pre-war levels in 1950. By 1954, the West German industrial index was equal to 177.3 in 1936. If in the first few years after the war, West Germany's industrial products were only equal to one-quarter of Britain's, then at present, in terms of some of the most important indicators (steel smelting, machine tool, automobile, shipbuilding production, etc.), West Germany has approached or surpassed Britain.
    After gaining a firm foothold, West German monopoly capital once again participated in the struggle among capitalist countries for sales markets. In the ten years after the war, West Germany increased its commodity exports year after year, especially after 1948, the increase was even faster. This is a unique phenomenon among capitalist countries.
        West German Post-War Annual Export Statistics
                      Exports　　　Percentage of total
    Year　　　(millions of US dollars):　　　　 world capitalist exports (%)
    1946　　　　227　　　　0.72
    1947　　　　319　　　　0.71

    1949　　　　1,129　　　　2.15

    1952　　　　4,025　　　　5.57
    1953　　　　4,422　　　　6.00
    1954 (Note)　　　　5,300　　　　6.50
    (Note) The export figure for 1954 is an estimated figure.
    The Marxist-Leninist theory of uneven capitalist development has been confirmed once again by real life. In 1947, West Germany ranked 26th in the capitalist world's exports, but by 1952 it had risen to 5th. Last year, West Germany defeated France and Canada again and jumped to third place (behind only the US and Britain). It should be particularly pointed out that under the conditions that the unified, all-encompassing world market has disintegrated, every increase in West Germany's exports is achieved by reducing the exports of other countries. In this regard, Britain and France have suffered the first blow. The rise of West Germany cannot but greatly sharpen the contradictions between capitalist countries.
    The reason why West Germany has been able to continuously achieve victories in foreign economic expansion is that it has more favorable conditions in this struggle than Britain, France, and other capitalist countries. The first is to collude with US monopoly capital and use US loans and investments. The degree of modernization of West Germany's industrial equipment after the war is much higher than that of Western European countries such as Britain and France. This makes West German commodities more competitive in the capitalist world market. Secondly, West Germany's economic expansion is directly supported by American financial oligarchs. Wall Street took advantage of the occupation system after the war to penetrate its economic power into all aspects of West Germany, further expanding the economic alliance between US and German monopoly capital that existed before the war. US monopoly capital uses West Germany to attack its competitors (especially Britain) and shares maximum profits with the Ruhr giants in West Germany's economic expansion. Finally, one must also pay attention to the fact that West Germany widely uses various means of economic expansion, especially using export subsidies to greatly reduce the export prices of commodities, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of West German commodities in the capitalist world market.
    The intensity of the struggle between West Germany, Britain, and France in the competition for sales markets is sufficient to point out the following situations.
    Europe is Germany's traditional market. Since 1951, West Germany has completely restored its pre-war status, surpassing Britain and France in exports to Western Europe. In Italy's imports, West Germany squeezed out Britain and France in 1950 and ranked second (behind only the United States), and continued to expand its power. By 1952, West Germany's exports to Italy had exceeded the sum of Britain and France. As early as three years ago, West Germany ranked first or second only to the United States in the imports of Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Greece. West German commodities are even seizing the British domestic market. In 1951-52 alone, West Germany's exports to Britain more than doubled.
    West Germany has also restored its position in Latin America. From 1949 to 1954, its exports to Latin America increased sixteen-fold. By 1951, it had surpassed France. By 1953, it had surpassed Britain again and ranked second, dividing this vast sales market with the United States. Among the more than 20 countries in Latin America, Britain barely maintained a slightly more favorable situation than West Germany only in Uruguay and Venezuela.
    West German monopoly capital has not only restored its pre-war overseas positions, but also continued to penetrate into the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia, invading the traditional spheres of influence of Britain and France. The Ruhr giants are making use of the difficulties encountered by Britain in the Middle East and the unfavorable situation of France in North Africa to try their best to attack their competitors. The situation in which it squeezed out Britain in the Turkish market is an illustrative example. In the total imports of Turkey, West German commodities accounted for only 0.7 percent in terms of quantity in 1948. By 1953, this proportion had risen to 21 percent. At the same time, the proportion of British commodities decreased from 24 percent to 15 percent. West Germany is also engaged in fierce struggles with Britain in countries such as Israel, Yemen, and Afghanistan. West Germany's exports to French overseas territories in 1954 increased almost fourfold compared with the level at the beginning of 1950.
    It can be seen from the above that the competition between West Germany and Britain in the struggle for sales markets is of an unusually sharp nature. The reasons are: 1. The expansion or contraction of overseas markets, and the increase or decrease in export levels, are matters of life and death for Britain, because the British economy is more dependent on foreign markets than other capitalist countries. 2. The composition of exports of Britain and West Germany are almost the same. Like Britain, West Germany's main export items are also machinery, automobiles, chemical products, and other industrial products. In the struggle for markets, Britain's positions are constantly being seized by West Germany. Of course, the position of Britain in foreign markets cannot be underestimated today. The quantity of British exports is about 30 percent more than that of West Germany. Britain still maintains a strong position within the Commonwealth. But it cannot be ignored that the capitalist world market is continuing to change constantly, and Britain is suffering from increasing pressure from West Germany.
    British and French monopoly capital once used the argument that the rearmament of West Germany could weaken its competitiveness in the struggle for sales markets to justify their policy of supporting the revival of the Hitler Wehrmacht. They expected that the Paris Accords would enable West Germany to use part of its strength to meet military needs, thereby reducing the pressure of West German commodities on British and French overseas markets. The actual situation is just the opposite. From the middle of 1953 to the autumn of 1954, West Germany's industrial production had a downward trend. However, once the Paris Accords were signed, this situation immediately changed. In the spring of 1954, only 80 blast furnaces in West Germany were in production. By October, when the Paris Accords were signed, the number of blast furnaces in West Germany immediately increased to 88. Steel production in that year suddenly increased to 17.4 million tons. The Paris Accords also brought
  “prosperity” to West Germany's power, chemical, automobile, shipbuilding and other industrial sectors. In addition, the development of military industry has increased West Germany's demand for raw materials, increased imports, and as a result, it will inevitably promote West German monopoly capital to step up exports in order to achieve a balance in foreign trade. West Germany's imports in 1954 increased by 20.6 percent over the previous year, and exports increased by 19.4 percent. Facts have proved that rearmament has not only not weakened West Germany's competitiveness in the capitalist world market, but has instead intensified the economic expansion of the Ruhr monopoly capital to the outside world.
    It is worth noting that in the struggle for sales markets, the contradictions between West Germany and the United States are also developing. West Germany's expansion to Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia is in conflict with the interests of US monopoly capital. Due to the restoration of the Ruhr monopoly capital and the re-participation of West German commodities in competition, and due to the stubborn resistance of Britain and France, the sales conditions in foreign markets are becoming increasingly unfavorable for the United States, and the struggle between the United States and Britain is becoming more intense. The sharp struggle has overwhelmed the exclusive position established by the United States in the capitalist world market in the early post-war period: its proportion of the total exports of the capitalist world has dropped from 40.1 percent in 1945 to 20.3 percent in the first half of 1954. In addition, the US imperialism's enforcement of discriminatory policies in international trade on various capitalist countries is very unfavorable to West German monopoly capital. The blockade and embargo on the peaceful democratic camp has aggravated West Germany's dependence on the Western European market; however, West Germany and Western European countries have the same economy and resources, which prevents Bonn from further increasing exports to Western Europe. West German capitalists are urgently in need of finding new outlets for their commodities.
    The market problem is a fundamental problem of contradictions in the capitalist world. The characteristic of the general crisis of capitalism (especially after the Second World War) is that the struggle for sales markets, raw material producing areas, and investment scopes is particularly acute. Of course, from a global perspective, the contradictions between the US and Britain are still the main contradictions within the capitalist world. But it cannot be ignored that due to the restoration of West German monopoly capital, new contradictions are growing and developing, and are greatly sharpening and complicating the old contradictions.

    西德——资本主义世界市场上的劲敌
    潘非
    战前的德帝国主义，在争夺销售市场的斗争中，曾经是美英法资本主义的倔强对手。第二次世界大战结束以后，西欧国家的垄断巨头们，力图利用德国的失败，消灭这个可怕的竞争者。的确，在战后最初的几年中，西德几乎完全被排挤出资本主义世界市场，它的输出降低到微不足道的水平。但是，不久之后，情况就有了变化。在今天，西德垄断资本已再度成为资本主义世界市场上的劲敌，严重地威胁着英法在这个市场中的地位，在某些地区甚至威胁到美国。
    在短短的十年中，使西德地位发生根本的变化，使鲁尔巨头们在惨败后又爬起来进行竞争和经济扩张的，是美帝国主义的对德政策。美国统治集团复活德国军国主义的方针，必然使西德的垄断资本迅速地恢复了昔日的地位。如同“凡尔赛和约”后美国以“道威斯计划”来扶植德国垄断资本一样，在第二次世界大战以后，华盛顿通过“马歇尔计划”向西德托拉斯投进了几十亿美元。这就不难理解，为什么作为战败国的西德，它的经济恢复反而要比北大西洋侵略集团中的西欧伙伴快得多。
    足以说明西德今日经济面貌的是：托拉斯和康采恩在西德的政治生活和经济生活中，重又扮演着重要的角色。战后西德资本的集中，甚至超过了战前的规模。七个冶金康采恩，集中了西德钢产量的百分之七十九。在采煤方面，十五个公司集中了西德煤产量的百分之八十二。说明西德经济状况的另一数字，是工业产量的迅速增加。西德工业生产在一九五○年即超过了战前水平。到一九五四年，西德工业指数已等于一九三六年的一七七·三。如果说，在战后的最初几年，西德的工业产品仅仅等于英国的四分之一，那么在目前，按一些最重要的指标来看（钢铁的镕铸量，机床、汽车、造船的生产等等），西德已经接近英国或者超过英国。
    西德垄断资本在站稳了脚跟以后，重新又参加到资本主义国家争夺销售市场的斗争中来了。战后十年中，西德年复一年地增加它的商品输出，特别是在一九四八年以后，增加更快。这在资本主义国家中是绝无仅有的现象。
        西德战后历年输出统计
                      输出量　　　在资本主义
    年份　　　（单位百万美元）：　　　　世界输出总额中所占的比重（％）
    一九四六　　　　二二七　　　　○·七二
    一九四七　　　　三一九　　　　○·七一
    一九四八　　　　七○六　　　　一·三五
    一九四九　　一、一二九　　　　二·一五
    一九五○　　一、九八一　　　　三·五六
    一九五一　　三、四七三　　　　四·四六
    一九五二　　四、○二五　　　　五·五七
    一九五三　　四、四二二　　　　六·○○
    一九五四（注）五、三○○　　　　六·五○
    （注）一九五四年的输出数字系估计数字。
    马克思列宁主义关于资本主义发展不平衡的学说，得到了现实生活的又一次证实。在一九四七年时，西德在资本主义世界的输出中处于第二十六位，到一九五二年已上升到第五位。去年，西德又击败了法国和加拿大，跃居第三位（仅次于美英）。特别应该指出的是，在统一的、无所不包的世界市场已经瓦解的条件下，西德输出的每一点增加，都是依靠缩小别国的输出来获得的。在这一方面，首先遭受到打击的，是英国和法国。西德的崛起，不能不使资本主义国家间的矛盾大大地尖锐起来。
    西德所以能够在对外经济扩张中不断取得胜利，是因为它在这一斗争中比英、法以及其他的资本主义国家具有更有利的条件。首先是，在和美国垄断资本勾结之下，利用美国的贷款和投资。战后西德工业设备现代化的程度，远比英法等西欧国家高得多。这样，就使得西德商品在资本主义世界市场上具有较高的竞争力。其次，西德的经济扩张，得到美国金融寡头的直接支持。华尔街在战后利用占领制度，把自己的经济势力渗透到西德的各个方面，进一步扩大了早在战前存在的美德垄断资本的经济联盟。美国垄断资本利用西德来打击自己的竞争者（特别是英国），在西德的经济扩张中和鲁尔巨头们分享最大限度的利润。最后，还不能不注意到这样一个因素：西德广泛地利用各种各样的经济扩张手段，特别是利用对输出的津贴大大降低商品出口价格，以加强西德商品在资本主义世界市场上的竞争能力。
    西德和英、法在争夺销售市场上斗争的激烈，只须指出下列情况就够了。
    欧洲是德国的传统市场。从一九五一年起，西德完全恢复了战前的地位，在对西欧的输出中凌驾于英、法之上。在意大利的进口中，西德在一九五○年即排挤掉英法而占第二位（仅次于美国），并且继续不断地扩张自己的势力，到一九五二年时，西德的对意输出已超过英、法两国的总和。远在三年以前，西德在奥地利、比利时、法国、荷兰、瑞典、瑞士、希腊这些国家的进口中，不是占第一位，就是仅次于美国。西德的商品甚至在夺取英国的国内市场，仅在一九五一——五二年，西德对英国的输出即增加了一倍以上。
    西德也恢复了在拉丁美洲的阵地。从一九四九年到一九五四年，它对拉丁美洲的输出增长了十六倍。到一九五一年，它已超过了法国。到一九五三年时，它又超过了英国而居第二位，和美国瓜分了这一个广大的销售市场。在拉丁美洲二十多个国家中，英国仅仅在乌拉圭和委内瑞拉勉强地维持着略比西德有利的局势。
    西德垄断资本不仅恢复了战前的海外阵地，而且继续向中东、北非、东南亚地区渗透，侵入英、法传统的势力范围。鲁尔巨头利用英国在中东地区所遭遇到的困难，利用法国在北非的不利处境，竭力打击它的竞争者。它在土耳其市场上排挤英国的情况是一个有说明性的例子。在土耳其的全部进口中，西德商品在数量上在一九四八年只占百分之零点七。到了一九五三年，这个比重已上升为百分之二十一。而同时期中英国商品所占的比重却从百分之二十四下降到了百分之十五。西德还在以色列、也门、阿富汗等国家中，和英国也进行着激烈的斗争。一九五四年西德对法国海外领地的输出，如果和一九五○年年初的水平相比，几乎增加到四倍。
    从上述情况可以看出，在争夺销售市场的斗争中，西德和英国的竞争具有异常尖锐的性质。原因在于：一、海外市场的扩大或缩小，输出水平的增涨或降低，对于英国来说是个生死攸关的问题，因为英国经济对于国外市场依赖的程度，要比其他资本主义国家大得多。二、英国和西德在输出的构成上几乎是相同的。同英国一样，西德主要的输出项目也是机器、汽车、化学制品以及其他工业产品。在争夺市场的斗争中，英国的阵地不断地为西德所攻占。当然，今天还不能低估英国在国外市场上的地位。英国的输出数量，比西德大约还多百分之三十。英国在英联邦内还保持着顽强的阵地。但不容忽视的是，资本主义世界市场正在继续不断地发生着变化，英国正遭受着西德愈来愈大的压力。
    英法垄断资本曾经以西德的重新武装可以削弱它在争夺销售市场斗争中的竞争能力，来为它们的支持复活希特勒国防军的政策辩解。他们指望巴黎协定将使西德把一部分力量用来满足军事需要，从而减轻西德商品对英法海外市场的压力。实际正好相反。从一九五三年年中到一九五四年秋，西德的工业产量曾有下降的趋势。但是，一当巴黎协定签字，这种情况立即有了改变。一九五四年春，西德只有八十个鼓风炉进行生产。到巴黎协定签订的十月份西德鼓风炉立即增加到八十八个。这一年的钢产量骤增到一千七百四十万吨。巴黎协定也为西德的电力、化学、汽车、造船和其他工业部门带来了
  “繁荣”。此外，军事工业的发展，使西德增加了对原料的需求，输入增加，结果是必然会推动西德垄断资本加紧输出，以便在对外贸易上取得平衡。西德一九五四年的输入比上一年度增加百分之二○·六，输出增加了百分之一九·四。事实证明，重新武装不仅没有削弱西德在资本主义世界市场上的竞争能力，相反地是加剧了鲁尔垄断资本向外的经济扩张。
    值得注意的是，在争夺销售市场的斗争中，西德和美国的矛盾同样在发展着。西德对于拉丁美洲、中近东、东南亚的扩张，是和美国垄断资本的利益相冲突的。由于鲁尔垄断资本的恢复和西德商品的重新参加竞争，由于英法的顽强抵抗，国外市场的销售条件对于美国是愈来愈加不利了，美国和英国之间的斗争也愈加剧烈了。尖锐的斗争，冲垮了战后初期美国在资本主义世界市场上建立的独占地位：它在资本主义世界输出总额中所占的比重，从一九四五年的百分之四○·一，下降到一九五四年上半年的百分之二○·三。另外，美帝国主义强使各资本主义国家在国际贸易中执行歧视政策，对于西德垄断资本是十分不利的。对和平民主阵营的封锁禁运，加重了西德对西欧市场的依赖；但是，西德和西欧各国具有同样的经济和资源，这种情况妨碍了波恩对西欧进一步增加输出的可能。西德资本家迫切地需要为自己的商品寻找新的出路。
    市场问题是资本主义世界矛盾的一个基本问题。资本主义总危机（特别在第二次世界大战以后）的特征，就是争夺销售市场、原料产地和投资范围的斗争特别尖锐化。固然，从世界范围来看，美英矛盾仍然是资本主义世界内部的主要矛盾。但不容忽视的是，由于西德垄断资本的恢复，新的矛盾正在增长和发展，并且使旧的矛盾大大地尖锐化和复杂化起来。
