The Benefits of Prefabricated Bamboo Houses
Li Qian

The moment you walk into the Decoration and Processing Plant of the First Construction Engineering Company of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, you can see two prefabricated bamboo houses, yellow-green in color with light gray doors and windows. These two prefabricated bamboo houses are sample products successfully trial-manufactured by the Decoration and Processing Plant this year. The cost per square meter is only 16 to 17 yuan, which is at least 40% to 50% cheaper than the cost per square meter of low-grade brick-and-wood sheds or dormitories.

Is this kind of bamboo house of too low a standard, making it very uncomfortable to live in, or even unable to guarantee safety? Not at all. The walls and roofs of the bamboo houses are pieced together with prefabricated double-layer bamboo blocks, with a 5 cm thick air layer in between the two layers of bamboo blocks. A layer of building paper is installed between the wooden frame and the bamboo layer, and a layer of tung oil is applied to the roof. Therefore, it can effectively prevent rain and moisture, and also prevent the intrusion of outdoor cold or heat. According to the comrades in the factory, its heat and cold resistance are not much different from those of standard brick-and-wood structure sheds. When I visited these two bamboo houses, which are now used as workers' dormitories and workers' clubs, I also felt that the indoor air was fresh and the light was bright, which was no worse than ordinary bungalows.

The main material used in the prefabricated bamboo houses is moso bamboo, which is not only cheap but also saves a lot of wood. According to statistics, the amount of wood required for a five-bay bamboo house can save about 60% compared with brick-and-wood houses of the same area. Moreover, because bamboo is lighter than brick and mud, the doors, windows, and bamboo block frames of bamboo houses can be assembled using old wood and unqualified short wood.

Because this kind of bamboo house is made of bamboo into bamboo blocks in advance, and then installed into a house on site, it has many significant advantages compared with brick-and-wood structure houses. First, because the bamboo house structure is simple and the construction is rapid, it can accelerate the progress of construction preparation work. According to statistics, a construction site with seven or eight hundred workers needs fifty rooms for dormitories. If dormitories with brick-and-wood structure are built, it will take fifty or sixty workers about a month to build them; if prefabricated bamboo houses are used, it will only take seven workers ten days to build them. Second, this kind of prefabricated bamboo house can be disassembled and moved five times and can be used for five or six years. If more attention is paid during disassembly and assembly or if it is slightly repaired, the service time can be extended. However, the service life of low-grade brick-and-wood sheds or dormitories is only three to five years, and at least one-third of the materials are lost each time they are dismantled. Third, this kind of prefabricated bamboo house can be used flexibly, and the user unit can divide the house into several rooms according to needs.

Now, the Decoration and Processing Plant of the First Construction Engineering Company of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has established a bamboo workshop to process bamboo houses for various construction sites of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau. However, because the establishment time is very short, the production capacity is still very low, and it can only produce prefabricated bamboo blocks to equip 300 to 500 square meters per month. In order to further meet the needs of various construction sites, the processing plant is considering expanding the production capacity of the bamboo workshop.

Adopting prefabricated bamboo houses is an appropriate measure to reduce the cost of temporary construction projects, save wood, accelerate construction preparation, and enable construction workers to live on the construction site as soon as possible. All basic construction sites, especially in the southern regions, can adopt this experience according to specific conditions; and should study measures to further reduce the cost of prefabricated bamboo houses. At present, although the cost per square meter of the prefabricated bamboo houses manufactured by the Decoration and Processing Plant of the First Construction Engineering Company of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau is only 16 or 17 yuan, there is still room for reduction. The bamboo they are using now is purchased by the local products company and then processed into bamboo blocks by hand. According to the calculation of the processing plant, if they directly purchase bamboo blocks from the producing area, the cost per square meter can be reduced by another 6%. As for the basic construction sites in bamboo-producing areas to build prefabricated bamboo houses, the cost can of course be cheaper. (Attached picture)

　　装配式竹房子的好处
　　李茜
    一走进北京市建筑工程局第一建筑工程公司装修加工厂的大门，就可以看到两幢配有淡灰色门窗的黄绿色的装配式竹房子。这两幢装配式竹房子是装修加工厂今年试制成功的样品。每平方公尺的造价只十六元至十七元，比低级砖木工棚或宿舍每平方公尺的造价至少还要便宜百分之四十至五十。
    这种竹房子是不是标准太低，住着很不舒适、甚至不能保证安全呢？完全不是的。竹房子的墙壁和屋顶都是用预制好的双层竹块拼成的，两层竹块中间是五公分厚的空气层，在木架和竹层中间装有一层血料纸，在屋顶上还涂有一层桐油，两面墙壁上安有玻璃窗。因此，既能有效地防雨、防湿，也能防止室外寒风或热气的侵入。据厂里的同志介绍，它的防热和防寒能力，同砖木结构的标准工棚没有多大的区别。我在参观这两幢现在用作工人宿舍和工人俱乐部的竹房子的时候，也感到室内空气新鲜，光线明亮，并不比一般平房差。
    装配式竹房子所用的主要材料是毛竹，不仅价钱便宜，而且可以节省大量木材。据统计，一幢五开间的竹房子所需要的木材，可比同面积的砖木房屋节省百分之六十左右。而且因为竹材较砖泥轻，竹房子的门窗和竹块框架都可以使用旧木材和不合格的短木拼合。
    由于这种竹房子是事先把竹材制成竹块，再到现场上安装成房屋，比起砖木结构的房屋来，它还有许多显著的优点。第一、由于竹房子结构简单，建造迅速，可以加速施工准备工作的进行。据统计在一个拥有七、八百名工人的工地上，需要五十间房屋作宿舍。如果盖砖木结构的宿舍，需五、六十个工人花一个月左右的时间去建造；如果用装配式竹房子，只需要七个工人花十天时间就可以建成。第二、这种装配式竹房子可以装卸移动五次，能使用五、六年，如果装卸时多加注意或稍加修理，使用时间还可以延长；而低级砖木工棚或宿舍的使用期限只有三、五年，且拆卸一次至少损失三分之一的材料。第三、这种装配式竹房子可以灵活使用，使用单位可以根据需要，将房子隔成几间。
    现在，北京市建筑工程局第一建筑工程公司装修加工厂已成立了竹工车间，替北京市建筑工程局各工地加工竹房。但因成立时间很短，生产能力还很低，每月只能生产装备三百至五百平方公尺的预制竹块。为了进一步满足各工地的需要，加工厂正在考虑扩大竹工车间的生产能力。
    采用装配式竹房子，是降低暂设工程的造价，节省木材，加速施工准备，及早使建筑工人在工地居住下来的一项适当的措施。各个基本建设工地，特别是南方各地都可以根据具体情况采用这个经验；并应该研究再进一步降低装配式竹房子造价的措施。目前，北京市建筑工程局第一建筑工程公司装修加工厂制造的装配式竹房子，每平方公尺的造价虽然只有十六、七元，但仍有可以降低的地方。他们现在用的竹子，是由土产公司负责采购、再用手工加工成竹块的。据加工厂计算，如果由他们直接从产地采买竹块，每平方公尺的造价还可降低百分之六。至于产竹地区的基本建设工地建造装配式竹房子，造价当然更可以便宜些。（附图片）
