To the Editor:

Deputy Premier of the State Council, Li Fuchun’s, "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" spoke to our hearts. Jiao Zhuanghu used to be a remote and impoverished mountain village. In 1952, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the village established an agricultural production cooperative. Now the entire village has been collectivized, and land yields have increased from the original 75 jin per mu to more than 200 jin. Our lives have greatly improved. The Five-Year Plan has given us an even clearer view of a beautiful and happy future.

Every member of our Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative deeply understands from many facts that the development of agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives cannot be achieved without the development of industry and the support of our worker brothers. For example, last year our cooperative expanded, and we had more land than before. The old farm tools were clumsy and slow, and it looked like we would not be able to complete the autumn plowing plan. Fortunately, we had the double-wheeled double-shared plow made by our worker brothers, which was both labor-saving and fast, and plowed the land deeply and well, so that we could complete the autumn plowing task on schedule. This year, more than 200 mu of cotton in our cooperative were infested with aphids. The worker brothers promptly sent sprayers and pesticides, helping us quickly eliminate the pests. Now everyone in Jiao Zhuanghu wears fine cloth clothes, and almost every household has a thermos…

However, we are not satisfied with the current situation. We are still using ancient farm tools for farming, and we have very little chemical fertilizer. We are still lighting oil lamps... We know that if we want to live the happy life of Soviet farmers, we should dedicate our strength to the realization of the Five-Year Plan.

This year, our cooperative has more than 2,900 mu of land. In addition to more than 400 mu planted with cash crops such as cotton and oilseeds, the rest is planted with grain. To ensure the realization of the Five-Year Plan, we plan to increase grain production by 200,000 jin of high-quality grain for the country. Now the technicians sent by the county are teaching us techniques; we have also prepared various pesticides for pest control. In addition, we will also develop forestry and animal husbandry production on the barren mountains near the village, increasing the income of cooperative members from various aspects and supporting national construction!

### 提高生产技术，防治病虫害，争取增产二十万斤粮食

    提高生产技术，防治病虫害，争取增产二十万斤粮食编辑同志：
    国务院李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，说出了我们的心愿。我们焦庄户过去是个地瘠民贫的偏僻山村，一九五二年在中共党支部的领导下，村里成立了农业生产合作社，现在全村已经合作化了，土地产量从原来的每亩七十五斤提高到二百多斤，我们的生活已经大大改善了。而五年计划，更使我们清楚地看到了美好幸福的未来。
    我们东方红农业生产合作社每一个社员从许多事实中都深刻地体会到：农业生产的发展和农民生活的改善，没有工业的发展和工人老大哥的支持是不行的。例如，去年我们社扩大了，土地比过去多，旧农具使起来又笨又慢，眼看要完不成秋耕计划。幸亏我们有了工人老大哥制造的双轮双铧犁，使起来又省劲又快，耕地又深又好，才能按期完成了秋耕任务。今年我社二百多亩棉花发生蚜虫，工人老大哥又及时送来了喷雾器和药粉，帮助我们很快就把虫扑灭了。现在焦庄户每一个人都穿着细布衣服，差不多的户都有了暖水瓶……。
    但是，我们并不满足于现在的光景。我们种地还使用着古老的农具，化学肥料还很少，我们还点着油灯，……。我们知道，我们要过苏联农民那样的幸福生活，就应该为五年计划的实现而献出自己的力量。
    今年，我们全社共有二千九百多亩地，除了四百多亩种棉花、油料等经济作物外，其余都是种粮食，为了保证五年计划的实现，我们计划为国家增产二十万斤优等的粮食。现在县里派来的技术人员正在向我们传授技术；我们还预备了各种治害虫的农药。此外，我们还要在村子附近的荒山上发展林业和牧业生产，从多方面增加社员收入，支援国家建设！
