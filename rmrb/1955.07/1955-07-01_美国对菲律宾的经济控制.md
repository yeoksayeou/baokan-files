　　US Economic Control Over the Philippines
　　Li Gao
    The recent struggle of all parties in the Philippines against the "Bell Trade Act," which economically enslaves the Philippines, has powerfully exposed the hypocritical face of American colonialists.

    On June 18, the Philippine government signed the agreement between the United States and the Philippines, concluded in December 1954, on revising the "Bell Trade Act." However, some influential members of the Philippine Congress have fiercely criticized this agreement and demanded the complete abolition of the Bell Trade Act. They pointed out that this agreement will keep the Philippine economy in a colonial state.

    The "Bell Trade Act" is a bill passed by the US Congress in April 1946 that stipulates the conditions for American colonial enslavement of the Philippines. On July 4 of the same year, the United States forced the Philippines to sign this bill as one of the conditions for the United States to recognize the "independence" of the Philippines.

    This bill deprived the Philippines of the right to manage its own foreign trade and tariffs. It stipulated that for the entire 28 years from July 4, 1946, American goods could be imported into the Philippines without restrictions, and the Philippines could not implement any resistance or restrictions. However, Philippine goods exported to the United States were subject to certain "quotas." At the same time, in the first eight years (later extended for another year and a half, i.e., until the end of 1955), the Philippines could not levy any tariffs on import and export commodities in trade with the United States. In subsequent years, only small tariffs could be levied gradually. It also stipulated that the Philippines had no right to regulate its own foreign exchange transactions, nor could it prohibit or restrict foreign exchange from leaving the country; and that US citizens or companies enjoy the same rights as Filipinos in doing business and developing natural resources in the Philippines.

    Relying on such a typical unequal treaty, American monopoly capital not only fully maintained but also further strengthened its monopoly over the Philippine economy, causing the Philippine economic situation to deteriorate day by day.

    The "Bell Trade Act" enabled the United States to continue to use the Philippines as a market for dumping goods and plundering cheap raw materials. The Philippines' annual trade with the United States always accounts for more than two-thirds of its total import and export trade. This one-sided trade has kept the Philippines in a state of trade deficit for many years. From 1946 to 1954, the total trade deficit reached more than 3.1 billion pesos. This serious trade deficit is mainly caused by the imbalance of trade with the United States. In 1954, the Philippines had a trade surplus of 7.2 million pesos with countries other than the United States, while it had a trade deficit of 162.2 million pesos with the United States.

    American monopoly capital also used its monopoly position to try its best to depress the prices of raw materials exported from the Philippines, while raising the prices of American industrial products to obtain super profits. According to the figures in the March 1953 issue of "International Financial Statistics," American capitalists bought 100 pounds of copra in Manila for US$6.6 and sold it for US$9 in the United States; bought 100 pounds of hemp for US$12.8 and sold it for US$25.5 in the United States. According to the materials listed in the "Philippine Industrial and Agricultural Development Plan" published by the Philippine government in 1950, if the Philippines produced one ton of steel itself, it would only cost 200 to 250 pesos, while the steel shipped from the United States was sold for 750 pesos per ton; the Philippines only needed 7 pesos per ton to manufacture fertilizer itself, while the fertilizer shipped from the United States was sold for 45 pesos per ton. From these facts, it can be seen how serious the exploitation and plunder of the Philippines by the United States is by using colonialist agreements to carry out unequal trade with the Philippines!

    The "Bell Trade Act" completely disarmed the Philippines of its weapons to protect its own national industry, allowing American goods and capital to flood the Philippines freely. Philippine Senator Laurel incisively pointed out: "Because the United States enjoys an overwhelming advantage in industrial efficiency, it is impossible for the Philippines to achieve even the slightest progress in industrialization." The goods that the United States transports into the Philippines duty-free are mainly consumer industrial products and surplus agricultural products, with very few means of production. In 1953, Philippine imports totaled 914 million pesos, of which machinery was only 59 million pesos, or only 6 percent. Not only that, but the "Bell Trade Act" also restricted the development of some processing industries in the Philippines. It stipulates that pure white sugar shall not exceed 50,000 tons of the 952,000 tons of sugar that the Philippines exports to the United States each year. That is to say, the Philippines can only produce crude sugar and cannot develop the sugar refining industry.

    Therefore, the Philippines cannot establish heavy industry, and even the original small amount of light industry is difficult to maintain. For example, in 1952, the cotton fabrics produced in the Philippines averaged only 0.3 meters per person, which was one-half less than in 1941. The total output value of the Philippine processing industry only accounted for 4.5 percent of the total national economy in 1951, while this proportion was 14.3 percent in 1938. This shows that under the increasingly heavy colonial plunder of the United States, the industrial production of the Philippines—even light industrial production—not only does not get "development" but also greatly regresses.

    The "Bell Trade Act" also hinders the development of Philippine agriculture, keeping it in a distorted state of colonial-type single raw material production. Sugar, hemp, and coconut products always account for more than 70 to 80 percent of the total export value of Philippine export commodities over the years. However, in recent years, due to the suppression of prices by the United States and the blows of "embargoes," etc., the production and export of these products in the Philippines have also been in a state of decline. For example, from 1951 to 1954, the price of ramie in the Philippines dropped from 65 pesos per picul to 26 pesos. This bankrupted many ramie producers, and the Philippine ramie output in 1954 decreased by 17.3 percent compared to 1951. The amount of copra exported from the Philippines decreased by 334,000 tons in 1953 compared to 1947, a decrease of 36 percent.

    As an agricultural country, the Philippines has been turned into "the second largest export market for American flour." In 1953, the Philippines imported 167,000 tons of flour, which was more than 60 percent higher than in 1939 before the war. In November 1954, the US "Foreign Operations Administration" stationed in the Philippines decided to dump surplus rice worth 100 million pesos (equivalent to US$50 million) to the Philippines.

    Due to the impact of the "Bell Trade Act," the Philippines is facing a serious financial and economic crisis. The trade deficit figure for 1954 was more than double that of 1953. In January of this year, its foreign exchange reserves were reduced to only 40 percent of the beginning of 1946. Its financial revenue is also very tight. In the eight years up to July last year, duty-free imports of American goods have cost it more than US$1.2 billion in tariffs, and the United States still has to force it to pay a large amount of military expansion expenses every year. The Philippine government fills part of the deficit by increasing taxes domestically and implementing inflation. As a result, the people's burden is constantly increasing.

    The lives of the Philippine people are becoming increasingly impoverished. According to statistics from the Central Bank of the Philippines, out of a total population of 21 million in the country, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people reached 4.8 million in October last year, of which 1.8 million were fully unemployed. In February of this year, the number of fully unemployed people increased to 2 million. Not only do the unemployed have no means of subsistence, but the income of employed workers is also extremely low. Philippine labor department officials have admitted that the income of 3 million employed Filipinos is not enough to maintain their lives. The situation of the farmers, who account for the vast majority of the Philippine population, is even more tragic. The "Philippine Free Press" once wrote: "The farmer lives in debt, dies in debt, but he cannot take the debt to the grave, and his descendants must inherit these debts." Kitoriano, the former acting Minister of Labor of the Philippine government, also said: "The standard of living of Filipinos today is lower than it was 20 years ago."

    Under this circumstance, the Philippine people's sentiment against American enslavement is rising day by day. In order to ease the resistance of the Philippine people, the United States and the Philippine government signed an agreement to amend the "Bell Trade Act" last December. In this revision, the United States made some superficial concessions, but in reality, it forced the Philippines to make more concessions. According to this agreement, the Philippines will abolish the 17 percent foreign exchange tax that it used to levy on export foreign exchange. This will further facilitate American capitalists to remit the profits they have seized in the Philippines back to the United States, and will also cause the Philippines to lose 180 million pesos in tax revenue each year. Under the guise of "reciprocity," American capitalists continue to enjoy the privilege of developing natural resources at will in the Philippines. The new agreement also stipulates that the Philippine authorities cannot take any industrial nationalization actions that are deemed to affect American interests, in order to protect the control of American companies over the Philippine economy. The amended agreement superficially cancels the provisions of the US president controlling the Philippine currency, but the Associated Press pointed out that because the Philippines has become a member of the International Monetary Fund, the US control over the Philippine currency exists anyway. Philippine Senator Recto sharply pointed out that this revision is to make the Philippines "suffer unequal treatment under the so-called equal rights clause." Even the leadership of the Philippine Liberal Party, which has always had close ties with the United States, said that the "concessions" obtained by the Philippines from the United States are superficial and not commensurate with the benefits obtained by the United States. The actual situation of the so-called "complete independence" and "true friendship" given by the United States is just like this. People would say that this is a typical example of American-style colonialism.

　　美国对菲律宾的经济控制
　　李高
    最近菲律宾各方反对美国在经济上奴役菲律宾的“贝尔贸易法”的斗争，有力地揭穿了美国殖民主义者对菲律宾的伪善面目。
    菲律宾政府在六月十八日签署了美菲两国在一九五四年十二月订定的关于修订“贝尔贸易法”的协定。但是，菲律宾国会中一些有势力的议员，都猛烈抨击这一协定，并要求完全废除贝尔贸易法。他们指出：这个协定将使菲律宾经济继续处于殖民地经济状态。
    “贝尔贸易法”是美国国会在一九四六年四月通过的一项规定美国对菲律宾的殖民奴役条件的法案。同年七月四日美国强迫菲律宾在这个法案上签字，作为美国承认菲律宾“独立”的条件之一。
    这个法案剥夺了菲律宾管理自己的对外贸易和关税的权利。它规定从一九四六年七月四日起的整整二十八年中，美国商品可以无限制地输入菲律宾，菲律宾不能施行任何抵制或限制，而菲律宾货物输往美国却规定了一定的“限额”；同时，在最初八年内（后来又再延长了一年半，即延至一九五五年底为止），菲律宾对美贸易的进出口商品，不能征收任何关税，以后各年也只能逐年递增地征收为数不大的关税。它又规定菲律宾无权整理自己的外汇交易，也不能禁止或限制外汇出境；并规定美国公民或公司在菲律宾经商和开发自然资源，享有和菲律宾本国人同等的权利。
    依靠这样一个典型的不平等条约，美国垄断资本不但完全保持、而且更加加强了它对菲律宾经济的垄断，使得菲律宾的经济情况日趋恶化。
    “贝尔贸易法”使美国得以继续把菲律宾作为倾销商品和掠取廉价原料的市场。菲律宾每年对美国的贸易，总是占它的进、出口贸易总额的三分之二以上。这种片面性的贸易，使得菲律宾常年处于入超状态，从一九四六年到一九五四年，入超总额达三十一亿比索以上。这种严重的入超，主要是由于对美贸易不平衡所造成的。在一九五四年，菲律宾对美国以外其他国家的贸易出超七百二十万比索，而对美贸易却是入超一亿六千二百二十万比索。
    美国垄断资本还利用它的垄断地位，极力压低菲律宾出口的原料品的价格，同时抬高美国工业品的价格，以获取超额利润。据“国际财政统计”一九五三年三月号所载的数字，美国资本家在马尼拉用六·六美元收买的一百磅椰干，在美国卖到九美元；用十二·八美元收买的一百磅麻，在美国卖到二五·五美元。又据菲律宾政府在一九五○年发表的“菲律宾工农业发展计划”中所列的材料，菲律宾如果自己生产一吨钢材，只需二百到二百五十比索，而美国运来的钢材卖价是每吨七百五十比索；菲律宾自己制造肥田粉每吨只需七比索，而美国运来的卖四十五比索一吨。从这些事实中可以看出，美国利用殖民主义的协定，对菲律宾实行不平等贸易，对菲律宾的剥削和掠夺是多么的严重！
    “贝尔贸易法”完全解除了菲律宾保护自己的民族工业的武器，听任美国商品和资本在菲律宾自由泛滥。菲律宾参议员劳雷尔说得一针见血：“由于美国在工业效能方面享有压倒的优势，因而菲律宾在工业化方面就不可能甚至获得一点点的进展。”美国免税运入菲律宾的商品，主要是消费性的工业品和剩余农产品，生产资料极少。一九五三年菲律宾进口货共值九亿一千四百万比索，其中机器只有五千九百万比索或只占百分之六。不但这样，“贝尔贸易法”还限制了菲律宾一些加工工业的发展。它规定菲律宾每年输美的九十五万二千吨糖的“限额”中，纯白糖不得超过五万吨。就是说，菲律宾主要只能生产粗糖，不能发展炼糖工业。
    因此，菲律宾不但不能建立重工业，而且连原有的一点点轻工业也难以维持。例如在一九五二年，菲律宾生产的棉织品，平均每一个人只合到○·三公尺，这比一九四一年还少了二分之一。菲律宾加工工业的生产总值，一九五一年仅占国民经济总产量的百分之四·五，而一九三八年这一比重曾是百分之十四·三。这表明在美国的越来越加重的殖民主义掠夺下，菲律宾的工业生产——即使是轻工业生产，不但得不到“发展”而且是大大地倒退了。
    “贝尔贸易法”也阻碍着菲律宾农业的发展，使它保持殖民地型的单一原料生产的畸形状态。菲律宾历年出口商品中，糖、麻和椰子产品三项总是占出口总值百分之七十几到八十以上。但近年来，由于美国的压价收购和“禁运”等的打击，菲律宾这些产品生产和出口也呈衰落状态。例如，从一九五一年到一九五四年，菲律宾苎麻的价格由每担六十五比索下降到二十六比索。这使得许多苎麻生产者破产，菲律宾苎麻产量在一九五四年比一九五一年降低了百分之十七点三。菲律宾输出椰干的数量，一九五三年比一九四七年减少了三十三万四千吨，即减少百分之三十六。
    作为一个农业国的菲律宾，它却被变成了“美国面粉的第二个最大的出口市场”。一九五三年，菲律宾进口面粉十六万七千吨，这比战前的一九三九年还增加了百分之六十多。一九五四年十一月，美国驻菲律宾的“援外事务管理署”又决定向菲律宾倾销价值一亿比索（合五千万美元）的剩余大米。
    由于“贝尔贸易法”的打击，菲律宾面临了严重的财政经济危机。一九五四年的入超数字又比一九五三年增加了一倍多。今年一月，它的外汇储备降低到只及一九四六年年初的百分之四十。它的财政收入也很窘迫，到去年七月为止的八年中，美货免税入口使它损失了关税十二亿美元以上，而美国还要迫使它每年付出大量的扩军费用。菲律宾政府以在国内增加税收、实行通货膨胀来填补部分亏空。结果是人民的负担不断加重。
    菲律宾的人民生活越来越穷困。据菲律宾中央银行统计，在全国二千一百万人口中，去年十月的失业和半失业人数高达四百八十万，其中全失业的有一百八十万。今年二月，全失业人数又增加到了二百万。不但失业者生活无依，就业工人的收入也极低微。菲律宾劳工部官员曾承认，有三百万就业的菲律宾人的收入不够维持生活。占菲律宾人口的绝大多数的农民的情况，更加悲惨。“菲律宾自由报”曾写道：“农民生活在债务中，死在债务中，可是，他不能够把债务带到坟墓里去，他的子孙必得继承这些债务。”菲律宾政府前劳工部代理部长基托里安诺也说：“菲律宾人今天的生活水平，比二十年前还要低。”
    在这种情况下，菲律宾人民反对美国奴役的情绪日益高涨，为了缓和菲律宾人民的反抗。美国和菲律宾政府在去年十二月签订了一个修改“贝尔贸易法”的协定。在这次修改中，美国作了某些表面上的让步，实际上却是迫使菲律宾作了更多的让步。根据这次协议，菲律宾要取消过去对出口外汇所征收的百分之十七的外汇税。这就更便利了美国资本家把在菲律宾攫取的利润汇回美国，而且使菲律宾每年又损失税收一亿八千万比索。在“互惠”幌子的掩饰下，美国资本家在菲律宾继续享有随意开发自然资源的特权。新的协议并规定菲律宾当局不能采取被认为是影响美国利益的任何工业国有化的行动，以保障美国企业对菲律宾经济的控制。修改后的协定在表面上取消了美国总统控制菲律宾货币的条文，但是，合众社就指出：由于菲律宾已经成为国际货币基金组织的一个会员国，美国对菲币的控制是无论如何都存在的。菲律宾参议员雷克托尖锐地指出：这种修改是使菲律宾“在所谓平等权利的条款下受到不平等待遇”。甚至和美国关系一向很深的菲律宾自由党领导机构也说：菲律宾获得美国方面的“让步”是表面的，同美国所获得的利益很不相称。美国所给予的所谓“完全独立”和“真正友谊”，其实际情况就是如此，人们倒要说，这正是美国式殖民主义的典型实例。
