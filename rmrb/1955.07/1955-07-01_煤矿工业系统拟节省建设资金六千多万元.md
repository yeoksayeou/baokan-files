The design, construction, and planning departments of the state-owned coal mine industrial system are taking various measures to strive to save more than 62 million yuan in capital construction funds this year.

The General Bureau of Coal Mine Administration has formulated standards for non-productive buildings such as dormitories, offices, and warehouses based on the different climatic conditions and people's living habits in various parts of the country. These standards stipulate that the cost of each square meter of dormitory construction should not exceed 45 yuan in northeastern northern regions and 30 yuan in areas south of the Yangtze River. After this measure is implemented, the funds saved by the state-owned coal mine industrial system in the second half of the year will be equivalent to about 40 percent of the investment in non-industrial construction in the second half of the year.

The Coal Mine Design Administration and the Coal Mine Basic Construction Administration are also taking active measures, planning to save more than 29 million yuan by selecting equipment and materials for industrial construction, lowering the standards of certain industrial auxiliary buildings, and improving management. Since the beginning of June, the Coal Mine Design Administration has concentrated a group of chief engineers from design institutes in various regions to specially study issues such as the selection of equipment for newly built and renovated mines, the reduction of standards for joint administrative and welfare buildings, the use of local materials, and material substitution. A new savings plan in terms of design has now been initially formulated. According to this plan, if half of the roadways in coal mines across the country use reinforced concrete supports instead of wooden sheds, 11 million yuan can be saved annually; simplifying the interior of certain joint buildings slightly, and changing three-story buildings to single-story buildings can reduce the cost by more than half. The design institutes under the Coal Mine Design Administration will re-examine and modify all designs according to the new standards without affecting the progress of the project. The Coal Mine Basic Construction Administration has established a savings office and decided to implement savings by strengthening the management of material quotas, improving the utilization rate of machinery, and saving management fees. According to preliminary calculations, construction aspects can save more than 8 million yuan, excluding auxiliary workshop service fees.

In order to implement these measures, the General Bureau of Coal Mine Administration is prepared to organize several working groups to go to key construction units in Northeast, North China, and East China to provide specific assistance and summarize advanced experiences. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　煤矿工业系统拟节省建设资金六千多万元
    国营煤矿工业系统的设计、施工和计划等部门，正在采取各种措施，争取在今年内节省基本建设资金六千二百多万元。
    煤矿管理总局已经根据全国各地不同的气候条件和人民生活习惯，分别订出了宿舍、办公室和仓库等非生产性建筑的标准。其中规定宿舍每平方公尺的造价在东北北部不得超过四十五元，长江以南地区三十元。这一项措施实现后，国营煤矿工业系统下半年节省下来的资金，就等于下半年非工业性建筑投资百分之四十左右。
    煤矿设计管理局和煤矿基本建设管理局也正在采取积极的措施，计划从工业建设的选用设备、材料，降低某些工业附属建筑标准和改进管理等方面，节约资金二千九百多万元。煤矿设计管理局从六月初就集中了各地设计院的一部分主任工程师，专门研究了新建、改建矿井的设备选用、行政福利联合大楼的降低标准、就地取材和材料代用等问题，现在已经初步订出一个新的设计方面的节约方案。根据这个方案，全国煤矿如有一半巷道采用钢筋混凝土支架代替木棚，每年就可节省一千一百万元；某些联合大楼的内部稍加简化，把三层楼房改为平房，造价可降低一半以上。煤矿设计管理局所属各设计院将在不影响工程进度的条件下，按照新的标准重新审查和修改所有的设计。煤矿基本建设管理局已经成立了节约办公室，决定要从加强材料定额管理、提高机械利用率和节约管理费等方面实行节约。据初步计算除辅助车间服务费外，施工方面可节约八百多万元。
    为了实现这些措施，煤矿管理总局已准备组织几个工作组，到东北、华北、华东等地的重点建设单位，具体帮助工作和总结先进经验。（新华社）
