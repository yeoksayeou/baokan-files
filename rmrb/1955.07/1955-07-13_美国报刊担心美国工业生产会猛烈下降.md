Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 11th: The magazine "U.S. News & World Report" published on July 1st, is concerned that U.S. industrial production will decline in the third quarter. The magazine believes that in the third quarter, some important industrial production may see a significant decline, with automobiles potentially falling by 47 percent and steel production by 11 percent. Housing construction activity is also estimated to be greatly reduced in the second half of the year.

The magazine said: "This year, in some sectors, the extent of production cuts will be greater than usual" because in the first half of this year, these industries had greatly increased production regardless of market demand, resulting in a large backlog of inventory and overproduction. The magazine cited the situation of automobiles as an example, saying that by June 1st this year, new car inventory reached a record 840,000 vehicles, and "the season for brisk car sales has passed, which clearly indicates that production needs to be drastically reduced."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the production index for May this year, released by the U.S. Federal Reserve System, was 138, a figure that just reached the level of the summer of 1953. This means that two years have passed, and the U.S. economy has hardly moved from its original position.

At the same time, it can be seen from U.S. newspaper reports that the foundation of the recent economic recovery in the United States is very unstable. The increase in automobile production and residential construction has led to some economic upturn. However, the production of many important industrial sectors is much lower than it was two years ago, such as the production of metal products, machinery, and instruments. The production of some consumer goods has also declined to varying degrees.

U.S. newspapers further pointed out that the large increase in military orders from the U.S. government primarily contributed to this partial economic recovery. The bulletin of the First National City Bank of New York estimates that the U.S. Department of Defense's military orders for the 1955 fiscal year are approximately $18 billion, compared to $9.2 billion in the previous fiscal year. In addition, the easing of credit is a major factor in the increase in housing construction and automobile sales. However, the easing of credit has also brought serious consequences, namely the rapid increase in consumer debt. Currently, housing mortgage debt has risen to over $80 billion, and consumer debt has increased to $31.5 billion.

U.S. newspapers point out that the United States currently has a large amount of unemployment, and the agricultural situation is also very serious. Farmers' income is constantly decreasing. According to the Department of Agriculture, farmers' mortgage debt is now approximately $8 billion. Agricultural problem expert Haskell wrote worriedly in the "Wall Street Journal" that "each major recession in business activity often starts from the farm."

"Fortune" magazine, when discussing the overall economic situation in the United States, pointed out that the economic recovery, even if it is not based on a broken leg, is based on legs made of clay. It believes that there will be a "sharp decline" in the future.

The U.S. business community is concerned that the easing of international tensions will slow down the expansion of armaments, thereby undermining the pillar on which the current U.S. economy depends. Therefore, they do not conceal their hope that any negotiations on easing international tensions will not produce decisive results.

But at the same time, some other U.S. business people also realistically estimate the current international situation, and therefore call for preparations to cope with the situation once international tensions ease. They point out that taking advantage of the opportunity to expand East-West trade is a way out.

### 美国报刊担心美国工业生产会猛烈下降

    美国报刊担心美国工业生产会猛烈下降
    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：七月一日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志担心，美国的工业生产在第三季度要下降。这家杂志认为，在第三季度内，一些重要的工业生产可能有很大的下降，汽车可能下降百分之四十七，钢铁生产可能下降百分之十一。房屋建筑活动估计在今年下半年内也要大大缩减。
    这家杂志说：“今年在某些部门，减产的程度将大过平常的情况”，因为今年上半年这些工业曾不顾市场需求情况，大量增加生产，结果积压了许多存货，生产过剩。这家杂志举出汽车的情况为例，它说，到今年六月一日为止，新车存货达到八十四万辆的纪录，“汽车畅销的季节已经过去了，这就清楚地指明生产要猛烈削减”。
    据新华社讯　美国的联邦储备系统管理局发表的今年五月份的生产指数为一三八，这一数字刚刚达到一九五三年夏天的水平，这就是说，两年过去了，美国的经济几乎还停留在原来的地方。
    同时，从美国的报纸消息中可以看到，美国最近经济的回升的基础是很不稳固的。汽车生产和住宅建筑的增加使得经济有某些上升。但是，许多重要的工业部门的生产都比两年前降低不少，例如金属制成品，机器，仪器的生产情形就是如此。某些消费品生产也有不同程度的下降。
    美国报纸还进一步指出，这一期间美国政府大量增加军事订货首先促成了这种部分性质的经济恢复。纽约花旗银行的公报估计，美国国防部在一九五五财政年度的军事订货约为一百八十亿美元，而在前一财政年度是九十二亿美元。此外，放宽信贷是房屋建筑和汽车销售增加的主要因素。而信贷的放宽同时也带来了严重的后果，即消费者债务的迅速增加。目前，房屋抵押债务上升到八百亿美元以上，消费者债务增加到三百十五亿美元。
    美国报纸指出，美国目前还有着大量的失业，农业情况也很严重。农民收入不断减少，据农业部材料，现在农民的抵押债务约为八十亿美元。农业问题专家哈斯克尔在“华尔街杂志”上担心地写道，“企业活动每次巨大的衰退经常是从农场开始的”。
    “幸福”杂志在谈到美国总的经济情况时指出，经济的恢复即使不是以断了的腿为立足点，也是以泥作的腿为立足点的。它认为今后还会发生“急剧的下降”。
    美国商业界表示担心，国际紧张局势的缓和会促使扩充军备缓慢下来，从而破坏目前美国经济所依赖的支柱。因此，他们并不掩饰这样的希望：关于缓和国际紧张局势的任何谈判将不会产生有决定意义的结果。
    但同时，另外某些美国商业界人士也现实地估计了目前的国际局势，因而呼吁要准备应付国际紧张局势一旦缓和下来的局面。他们指出，利用扩大东西方贸易的机会是一条出路。
