Welcoming the Second Session of the First National People's Congress

	An Overview of Food and Public Security as I Saw It
	Chen Shaoxian, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

    I am a delegate to the National People's Congress elected from Jiangxi Province. I originally intended to return to Jiangxi to visit the people of my hometown and listen to their opinions. However, due to health reasons, I could not travel far, so I had to conduct my inspection work in a place not far from Beijing. On May 25th, I and several other delegates went to Baoding to listen to the responsible comrades of Hebei Province introduce the general situation of Hebei Province. From June 1st to 14th, we went to Tangshan City and Tangshan Special District for on-the-spot inspections and visited the three villages of Lianghe, Zhongzhuozhuang, and Getiaogang in Changli County. Wherever we went, the local Party and government leaders provided us with every convenience in our work. Although our working time was relatively short, we extensively contacted and talked with people from all walks of life and saw some of the actual situation of industrial and agricultural production.

    When we set out, the national food shortage atmosphere had not yet been eliminated, and the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was unfolding. Therefore, during the inspection process, we paid special attention to the food issue and social security issues.

    Since our country's food policy is completely correct and the government has full guarantees for the people's food supply, then why did a food shortage occur at one time? Now everyone understands that the so-called shortage at that time was not a real shortage, but an artificial shortage; in other words, although many people shouted for food shortages, very few people actually lacked food. In Hebei Province, because the area occupied by cash crops is relatively large, the province's food production has been relatively reduced. However, the central government has allocated a large amount of grain, which can undoubtedly guarantee the supply throughout the province. Taking the situation in Tangshan City, which we saw, as an example, after the consolidation of the unified purchase and sale work, the city's total grain sales decreased significantly. The grain sales figures in May decreased by about 10% compared with April, and decreased by about 2.5% compared with the same period last year. The person in charge of Tangshan City told us that the grain sales in June may also decline. This fact powerfully illustrates that the food problem in the city is obviously not a shortage of food, but a waste; not a problem of increasing supply, but a problem of plugging loopholes. Furthermore, taking the situation in Tangshan Special District as an example, after consolidating the unified purchase and sale work in conjunction with the grain "three fix" policy, its ten counties quickly eliminated the state of tension, the masses' mood stabilized, and their enthusiasm for production increased. It can be seen that the food shortage in rural areas is mainly an artificial shortage. For example, in Henan Village, Zunhua County, there are 220 households, and 100 households call for food shortages, but only 7 of them are actually short of food. However, we believe that even if only one household out of thousands lacks food and does not receive a timely supply, it should be admitted that there are shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale work. The government's policy is to supply more to those who lack more, supply less to those who lack less, and not supply to those who do not lack. However, the rural staff members do not have a clear understanding of the food situation in their own villages and do not know the situation of each household, so some deviations will inevitably occur in the implementation. On the one hand, there are phenomena of supplies that should have been provided but were not, or supplies that were insufficient; on the other hand, there are situations where supplies should not have been provided but were, or supplies that should have been less but were more. During the consolidation of the unified purchase and sale work, some areas did not thoroughly implement the spirit of the central government's instructions, so that the masses mistakenly thought that the consolidation of the unified purchase and sale work was "returning grain," so they shouted for food shortages even if they did not lack food; at the same time, the supply to food-deficient households was not timely, and even individual staff members adopted a bureaucratic attitude to deal with the issue of supplementary grain. At this time, landlords, rich peasants, and other counter-revolutionary elements took the opportunity to carry out incitement and sabotage. For example, the landlord Zhao Wenrui of Datan Village, Changli, had 1,700 catties of stored grain, purchased 350 catties of state grain at a set price, and pretended to be short of food, and incited 15 farmers to demand supplies, which formed an artificial tension and false panic. In addition, a few people were genuinely short of food in the short term, because some farmers sold "excess grain." That is to say, they sold their rations as surplus grain. On the one hand, this shows that some working cadres did not thoroughly publicize and explain the state's policy of purchasing surplus grain; but on the other hand, it also reflects that the general farmers actively support the government's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, especially the activists in the rural areas, who, in order to motivate the masses, even said that their rations were surplus grain and sold them to the state, and did not shout when they were short of grain. In Tangshan City, we held a forum attended by more than 40 people, including workers, suburban farmers, women, cultural and educational workers, and people from other fields. The forum lasted for nine hours. They not only unanimously supported the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, but when we asked them about their opinions on the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and edible oil, they all pointed out from their own painful experience of soaring prices and merchant speculation under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek before liberation that it was absolutely necessary for the state to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale, which truly conformed to the interests of the majority of the people. The current allocation of edible oil and cotton cloth, especially in rural areas, is certainly not generous, but it is generally considered to be barely enough. They said that in order to build socialism, even if there are some difficulties, they have the confidence to overcome them. When I was in Beijing, I heard some people say that the masses had opinions on the policy of unified purchase and sale. After this inspection and visit, I realized even more that the vast majority of these so-called "masses" with opinions were landlords, rich peasants, illegal capitalists, and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, while the real people completely supported the government's policy of unified purchase and sale.

    I mentioned earlier that landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements stirred up trouble on the grain issue and carried out various kinds of incitement and sabotage. And when we heard the reports from Tangshan City and Tangshan Special District on the social security situation, we knew even more that the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements were truly all-pervasive. In the city, they first concentrated their targets on sabotaging industrial production; in the countryside, they tried every means to sabotage the agricultural cooperative movement. Obviously, what they fear most is that we will build a socialist society. In 1954, 53 counter-revolutionary sabotage accidents occurred in factories and enterprises in Tangshan City, of which 43.8% occurred in key parts such as new technology equipment, power, design, testing, and ingredients. Tan Zhaowen, a counter-revolutionary element lurking in Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant, caused an explosion accident of the "oil switch," causing a loss of more than 30,000 yuan to the state. According to incomplete statistics from Tangshan Special District, a total of 117 cases of various kinds of sabotage against agricultural production cooperatives occurred in 1954; 71 cases occurred from January to April 1955, equivalent to three-fifths of the 117 cases in 1954. In these four months, counter-revolutionary elements used theft, arson, poisoning, assassination, and other means to cause cooperatives to lose 2,468 yuan in property, kill 16 livestock, and injure 6.

    According to the statistics of Tangshan City and Tangshan Special District, it is clearly shown that after the central government put forward the general line and implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale in 1953, the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, illegal capitalists, and counter-revolutionary elements have been increasing year by year, and the means adopted have become more concealed, sinister, and vicious. They often exploit some shortcomings in the work of our staff members, and carry out rampant rumors, distortions, and instigations, using some people with discontent to be their mouthpieces. This deserves serious vigilance from everyone. I remember that when studying the general line, the leading comrades repeatedly pointed out to us: during the transition period of the state, the classes that have been eliminated and the classes that are about to be eliminated will never be reconciled to extinction, and the class struggle will become more complex, acute, and fierce. The criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique illustrate this truth, and the activities of counter-revolutionary elements in Tangshan City and Tangshan Special District also fully illustrate that internal and external enemies will try every means to sabotage our great socialist construction cause. Therefore, I think it is absolutely necessary to continue the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities throughout the country. During this inspection process, I personally saw that the masses expressed their hatred for counter-revolutionary elements and expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that some counter-revolutionary cases have not yet been solved. It can be seen that the broad masses of people urgently demand the strict suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and the eradication of all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    The lives of the farmers we saw have indeed improved significantly compared with before liberation, but there are still some difficulties. For example, the supply of feed for draught animals, chemical fertilizers, and medical and health equipment cannot meet the actual needs of farmers; in terms of living standards, there is also a considerable gap compared with cities. This specifically illustrates that only by realizing the state's socialist industrialization can the poverty and backwardness of the countryside be fundamentally changed. Through this inspection work, I have further realized the great significance of practicing strict economy, opposing waste, and concentrating efforts on doing a good job in industrial construction. Practicing strict economy and opposing waste are especially important in cities. Judging from the situation in Tangshan City, a factory spent nearly one million yuan to build a large-scale club, while two-thirds of the workers in this factory did not have dormitories. This is an unreasonable phenomenon. A farmer representative said to us: "As long as the cities can save, we have nothing to say." It can be seen that farmers have opinions on some wasteful phenomena in cities. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on vigorously increasing production and practicing economy and opposing extravagance and waste, and treat it as a regular political task. Only in this way can we better carry out socialist construction and better consolidate the great worker-peasant alliance.

    Due to my old age and poor health, this inspection work was not comprehensive and in-depth enough, and the above experiences and views may not be correct. However, during the work process, I did receive a lot of education and deeply felt that the more and wider I come into contact with the people, the brighter my eyes will become and the clearer my mind will become; in this way, when participating in the discussion of important national policies, the opinions I provide may be more practical and conform to the wishes of the broad masses of people.

### 我所看到的粮食和治安概况

    迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议
　　我所看到的粮食和治安概况
　　全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员　陈劭先
    我是江西省选出的全国人民代表大会代表，这次本想回到江西，访问故乡的人民，倾听他们的意见；但因健康关系，不能远行，只好在离京不远的地方去进行视察工作。五月二十五日，我和几位代表一道前往保定，听取河北省负责同志关于河北省一般情况的介绍。六月一日到十四日之间，我们就到唐山市、唐山专区实地视察，并访问了昌黎县两河、中桌庄、葛条港三个村。我们每到一个地方，当地党政负责同志都给了我们工作上一切的便利，我们工作的时间虽然比较短促，但还是相当广泛地同各界人民进行了接触和交谈，看到了一些工业和农业生产的实际情况。
    在我们出发的时候，全国粮食紧张气氛还未消除，对胡风反革命集团的斗争正在展开，因此，在视察过程中，我们也就特别注意粮食问题和社会治安问题。
    我们国家的粮食政策既然是完全正确的，政府对于人民粮食的供应又有着充分的保证，那末，为什么发生粮食一度紧张的情况呢？现在大家都明白当时所谓紧张，并不真是紧张，而是人为的紧张；换句话说，喊缺粮的人虽多，真缺粮的人很少。河北省因为经济作物所占面积较大，本省粮食生产就相对地减少了。但中央已经调拨了大量的粮食，无疑可以保证全省的供应。就我们所看到的唐山市的情况来说，在进行了整顿统销工作以后，全市粮食的总销量显著下降，五月份销粮数字较四月份降低了百分之十左右，比去年同期减少了百分之二点五左右。唐山市的负责人告诉我们，六月份的销粮量还可能下降。这一事实有力地说明城市的粮食问题，显然不在缺粮，而在于有浪费；不是增加供应问题，而是堵塞漏洞问题。再就唐山专区的情况来说，在结合粮食“三定”政策整顿统销工作以后，它所辖十个县也迅速消除了紧张状态，群众情绪稳定，生产积极性提高。可见农村的粮食紧张，主要是人为的紧张。例如遵化县河南村，有二百二十户，叫缺粮的一百户，而其中真正缺粮的只有七户。但是我们认为，即使在千百家中只有一户缺粮而没有及时得到供应，也应该承认统销工作是有缺点的。政府的方针是，多缺多供，少缺少供，不缺不供，而乡村工作人员对于本乡本村的粮食情况，并不是人人有数，家家摸底，执行起来就不免会发生一些偏差。一方面有应供未供或供应不足的现象；另一方面又有不应供而供或应少供而多供的情形。在整顿统销工作的时候，又有些地区对于中央指示的精神贯彻得不深不透，以致群众误会整顿统销工作就是“退粮”，因而不缺粮也喊缺粮；同时对于缺粮户供应也有不及时的情况，甚至个别工作人员采取官僚主义的态度来对待补粮的问题。这时，地主、富农及其他反革命分子就趁机进行煽动破坏。例如昌黎大滩村地主赵文瑞，存粮一千七百斤，套购国家粮食三百五十斤，还假装缺粮，并煽动十五户农民要求供应，这就形成了人为的紧张和虚假的恐慌。此外，也有少数人在短时期内是真正缺粮的，这是由于一些农户卖了“过头粮”。就是说，把口粮当作余粮卖出了。这一方面固然说明有些工作干部对于国家收购余粮的政策宣传解释得不够透彻；但另一方面也反映出一般农民是积极拥护政府的粮食统购统销政策的，特别是农村中的积极分子，他们为了带动群众，竟把口粮说是余粮卖给国家，而缺粮的时候也不叫喊。在唐山市我们曾举行过一次座谈会，参加的有工人、郊区农民、妇女、文教工作者和其他各方面的人士四十多人，连续座谈了九小时之久。他们不仅异口同声拥护粮食统购统销政策，当我们问到他们对于棉布和食油统销的意见时，他们也都从自己解放前在蒋匪统治下所受物价飞涨、商人投机倒把的痛苦经验中，指出国家实行统购统销政策是完全必要的，是真正符合多数人民的利益的。食油、棉布当前配购的数量，特别在农村，当然是不宽裕的，但是一般都认为勉强够用。他们表示，为了建成社会主义，即使有一点困难，也有信心可以克服。在北京的时候，我曾经听到一些人说群众对于统购统销政策有意见，经过这次视察访问以后，我更加体会到这些所谓有意见的“群众”，绝大多数是地主、富农、不法资本家和隐藏的反革命分子，而真正的人民群众是完全拥护政府的统购统销政策的。
    前面说到地主、富农和反革命分子曾在粮食问题上兴风作浪，进行各种煽动和破坏。而我们在听到唐山市和唐山专区关于社会治安情况的报告中，更知道反革命分子的破坏活动真是无孔不入。在城市，他们首先是集中目标破坏工业生产；在农村，他们是千方百计地破坏农业合作化运动。显然，他们最害怕的就是我们要建成社会主义社会。一九五四年唐山市的厂矿、企业中，曾发生反革命破坏事故五十三起，其中有百分之四十三点八是发生在新技术装备、动力、设计、化验和配料等要害部位。潜伏在唐山钢厂的反革命分子谭兆文，制造“油开关”爆炸事故，给国家造成三万多元的损失。据唐山专区的不完全统计，一九五四年共发生各种破坏农业生产合作社的案件一百一十七起；一九五五年一至四月就发生七十一起，相当于一九五四年一一七起的五分之三。这四个月中，反革命分子用盗窃、纵火、投毒、暗害等手段，使合作社损失财产二千四百六十八元，害死牲口十六头，伤六头。
    根据唐山市和唐山专区的统计，都清楚地说明一九五三年中央提出了总路线和实行统购统销政策以后，地主、富农、不法资本家和反革命分子的破坏活动是逐年上升，所采取的手段也更加隐蔽、阴险和毒辣。他们经常钻我们工作人员工作上某些缺点的空子，大肆进行造谣、歪曲和挑拨离间，利用一些有不满情绪的人们，来做他们的传声筒。这是值得大家严重警惕的。记得在学习总路线的时候，领导同志就曾反复地向我们指出：在国家过渡时期，已经被消灭的阶级和将要被消灭的阶级是决不甘心灭亡的，阶级斗争将更加复杂、尖锐和激烈。胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动说明了这个真理，而反革命分子在唐山市和唐山专区的活动情况，也充分说明内外敌人是要千方百计来破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设事业的。因此，我认为完全有必要在全国范围内继续进行镇压反革命活动的工作。我在这次视察过程中，亲眼看到群众对反革命分子表示切齿痛恨，并对一些反革命案件迄未破获表示不满，可见广大的人民群众是迫切要求严厉镇压反革命活动和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的。
    我们看到的农民生活，比解放前的确有了显著的改善，同时也还存在一些困难。例如耕畜饲料、化学肥料和医疗卫生设备都还不能满足农民的实际需要；在生活上和城市比较，也有着相当大的距离。这具体地说明只有实现国家社会主义工业化，才能根本改变农村的贫困和落后状态。通过这次视察工作，我更认识了厉行节约、反对浪费、集中力量搞好工业建设的重大意义。厉行节约、反对浪费，在城市尤其重要。从唐山市看到的情况说，有一个工厂花了近百万元盖一个规模很大的俱乐部，而这个工厂还有三分之二的工人没有宿舍。这就是一种不合理的现象。一个农民代表对我们说：“只要城市能够节约，我们就没有什么话说。”可见农民对于城市中一些浪费现象是有意见的。我们必须坚决贯彻毛主席关于厉行增产节约反对铺张浪费的指示，把它当作一个经常性的政治任务，只有这样，我们才能更好地进行社会主义建设，也才能更好地巩固伟大的工农联盟。
    由于我的年纪大，身体不好，这次视察工作是不够全面和深入的，以上一些体会和看法也许不够正确。但在工作过程中，自己确实受到了不少的教育，深深感到：跟人民群众接触愈多愈广，自己的眼睛就会愈加明亮，头脑也就会愈加清醒；这样，在参与讨论国家重要政策的时候，自己所提供的意见，也就有可能更加切合实际和符合广大人民的愿望。
