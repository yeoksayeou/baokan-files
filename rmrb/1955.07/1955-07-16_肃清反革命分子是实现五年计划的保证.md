Eliminating Counter-Revolutionaries is a Guarantee for the Realization of the Five-Year Plan
    National People's Congress Representative Ding Guitang
    The report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy made by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, as well as the draft of the First Five-Year Plan, clearly inform us that since 1953, China's socialist transformation and socialist construction have been advancing victoriously. The strength of China's socialist economy is growing stronger year by year. The complete realization of the First Five-Year Plan will lead to a greater increase in the socialist components of China's economy, a more astonishing development of the entire national economy, a continuous improvement in the material and cultural life of the people, and a further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship. In the following ten years or more, China will be built into a prosperous and great socialist country. All these past great achievements and the beautiful future ahead are something that people across the country are cheering and celebrating, and sincerely thanking the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for.

    However, what we the people celebrate is precisely what the enemies of the people detest and hate. American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are now further threatening us with war, the counter-revolutionaries hiding on the mainland are stepping up various sabotage activities, and some illegal capitalists are also taking various measures to resist socialist transformation. All of this shows that the enemies of the people will take various methods to sabotage the Five-Year Plan.

    In June of this year, I went to Liaoning Province for inspection. Regarding the activities of counter-revolutionaries in the province, what I learned from the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee and the Haicheng County People's Committee can be briefly summarized as follows: The US-Chiang Central Intelligence Agency, Japanese intelligence agencies, and the US-Rhee Maritime Intelligence Bureau have used various methods to send in spies and agents, collect various intelligence, and carry out subversive plots against China's economic and national defense construction, distributing reactionary leaflets, slogans, and reactionary publications to carry out so-called "psychological warfare" and so-called "enemy-occupied area work." Organized counter-revolutionary activities such as the so-called "China Youth Congress" are rampant again. In many counties, feudal and reactionary secret societies have shown signs of revival. Some counter-revolutionaries have forged documents to infiltrate factories, mines, and government agencies, taking the opportunity to sabotage, murder cadres, or burn public property. Some counter-revolutionaries have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and instigate trouble or organize theft gangs. Last year, 32 percent of basic construction accidents in Shenyang were caused by sabotage by counter-revolutionaries. In rural areas, counter-revolutionaries have organized fake cooperatives to confront genuine cooperatives, trying to lure party members and members of the Communist Youth League out of the genuine cooperatives to collapse the cooperatives, and openly proclaiming to murder party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cooperative members. Some counter-revolutionaries have tried to infiltrate the cooperatives, pretending to be active, seizing responsible positions, and taking the opportunity to create disputes, attempting to undermine the organization. Last year, there were seventy-six relatively serious sabotage incidents in the rural areas of the province, almost all of which were committed by counter-revolutionaries. Criminal activities are also rampant. Last year, 58 percent of criminal cases were related to counter-revolutionaries. The general reflection of the masses is that the government is too lenient in dealing with these counter-revolutionaries and that those who have been arrested should not be easily released to avoid endangering the people again. In Dalian, the activities of counter-revolutionaries are as follows: when the Soviet army withdrew, counter-revolutionaries spread rumors; ninety sabotage incidents occurred in factories and mines last year, and thirteen occurred from January to June this year, mainly sabotaging technical designs. There are still remnants of counter-revolutionaries in five aspects in society, some of whom have fled from other places (such as Shandong), and 60 percent of them have infiltrated internal organs and enterprises; a considerable number of counter-revolutionaries released in recent years have not been reformed and still have hostile emotions and revengeful intentions. In rural areas, some remnants of the puppet regime, landlords, rich peasants, and some controlled elements have used various methods to sabotage agricultural production cooperatives, burning crops, felling trees, threatening the masses, and writing reactionary slogans. Criminal offenses, from the end of last year to the first quarter of this year, have subsided slightly after being suppressed, but they continue to occur. Some of them are related to counter-revolutionaries.

    From the incomplete information we have learned above and from what we have seen and heard in the domestic inspections of other National People's Congress representatives as seen in the newspapers, it is proved that not only are there still hidden counter-revolutionaries all over the country, but there are also many of them. Counter-revolutionary sabotage activities have not only not stopped, but are also very serious. The enemy's sabotage has caused incalculable losses to the country and the people and has a very unfavorable impact on China's socialist construction. The reason why all counter-revolutionaries still dare to carry out continuous conspiracies and sabotage so boldly and desperately is, on the one hand, because this is an extremely cruel and extremely sharp class struggle of life and death, and they are making a dying struggle; on the other hand, it is also because we have strong paralyzing thoughts and the punishment for all counter-revolutionaries is somewhat too lenient. In order to prevent counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging socialist construction and ensure the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, our people across the country must greatly raise our vigilance, correct any degree of paralyzing thoughts and lenient behavior, resolutely launch exposure and struggle against all counter-revolutionaries, so that all counter-revolutionaries cannot find a hiding place in any corner.

### 肃清反革命分子是实现五年计划的保证

    肃清反革命分子是实现五年计划的保证
    全国人民代表大会代表　丁贵堂
    国务院副总理李富春所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，以及第一个五年计划草案，很清楚地告知我们：自一九五三年起，我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业是不断地胜利地向前迈进的。我国社会主义经济的力量是一年比一年强大的。第一个五年计划的完全实现，将使我国社会主义经济的成分更大地增长，全部国民经济更有惊人的发展，全国人民的物质和文化生活也将不断地提高，人民民主专政的政权也将益加巩固。在此后十多年间，我国将建成一个富强的伟大的社会主义国家。所有这些已往的伟大成就和将来的美好前途，我们全国人民都为之欢欣鼓舞，并衷心感谢中国共产党和毛主席。
    但是我们人民所欢欣庆祝的，正是人民的敌人所厌恶仇恨的。美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团现在正在进一步对我们进行战争威胁，隐藏在大陆上的反革命分子正在加紧进行各种破坏活动，某些不法资本家也在采取各种手段抵抗社会主义改造。这些都说明人民的敌人将采取各种方法来破坏五年计划。
    本年六月间我到辽宁省去视察，关于反革命分子在该省活动的情况，我由辽宁省人民委员会和海城县人民委员会所了解的，简要地说是这样：美蒋的中央情报局、日本特务机关和美李海上情报局曾用各种方法派进来特务间谍，搜集各种情报，对我国经济和国防建设进行阴谋破坏，散发反动传单标语、反动刊物以进行所谓“心理战”和所谓“敌后工作”；有组织的反革命活动如所谓“中国青年大会”等又见猖獗。在不少县份封建反动的会道门有死灰复燃之势；有些反革命分子曾假造证件混入各厂矿和机关，乘机破坏，谋杀干部，或焚烧公有财产；有些反革命分子乘机造谣挑拨，或组织偷盗集团。去年沈阳基本建设事故中有百分之三十二是由于反革命分子的破坏所造成。在农村中，反革命分子组织假合作社同真合作社对抗，设法由真合作社中弄出党员、团员，使社垮台，并公开宣扬要谋杀党员、团员和社员。有些反革命分子设法混入合作社，假装积极，窃据负责地位，乘机制造纠纷，想搞垮组织。去年全省农村中发生了七十六起比较严重的破坏事故，几乎全是反革命分子所为。刑事罪犯活动也是猖獗的，去年刑事罪犯案中有百分之五十八同反革命分子有关。一般人民群众的反映是政府对这些反革命分子处理太宽，已逮捕的不应当轻易释放，以免再危害人民。在旅大市，反革命分子活动的情况是：苏军撤退时反革命分子曾大肆造谣；厂矿中去年发生了九十起破坏事故，今年一月至六月发生了十三起，主要是从技术设计上进行破坏的。在社会上仍有五个方面残余漏网的反革命分子，其中有一些是从外地（如山东）逃来的，他们有十分之六已混入机关企业内部；近年释放的反革命分子中也有相当数量没有改造好，还有敌对情绪和报复企图。农村中有一些敌伪残余、地主富农分子和一些被管制分子曾用各种方法破坏农业生产合作社，焚烧庄稼，砍伐树木，威胁群众，写反动标语。刑事犯罪，从去年底到今年第一季，经过镇压，稍形敛迹，但仍继续发生。其中有些是同反革命分子有关的。
    从我们以上所了解的不完全的情况和由报纸上所看到的其他全国人民代表大会代表在国内各地视察中所见所闻的来看，证明现时全国各地不但仍有暗藏的反革命分子，而且还为数很多。反革命的破坏活动不但没有停止，而且还很严重。敌人的破坏，造成了对国家和人民的无法估计的损失，对我国社会主义建设有很不利的影响。一切反革命分子所以仍敢这样大胆地决死地进行不断的阴谋破坏，一方面是由于这是一个你死我活的极残酷极尖锐的阶级斗争，他们要作垂死的挣扎；一方面也是由于我们有浓厚的麻痹思想，对一切反革命分子的处罚有些太宽。为了防止反革命分子对社会主义建设的破坏，并保证第一个五年计划胜利完成，我们全国人民必须大大地提高警惕，纠正任何程度的麻痹思想和宽纵行为，坚决对一切反革命分子展开揭发和斗争，使一切反革命分子在任何角落找不到藏身之地。
