The following is from the column:

　　An irrigation project has been constructed by a unit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps on the fertile virgin land on the south bank of the Gongnais River near Yili. This irrigation system includes 222 buildings of various sizes, the 19-kilometer-long Kafuke River East Main Canal, four branch canals, and forty-seven lateral canals. Approximately 850,000 cubic meters of earth and stone were excavated and filled. The entire irrigation system is designed according to the requirements of a modern state-owned farm. The main canal has a flow rate of 3.5 cubic meters per second and can irrigate 50,000 mu of farmland. Soldiers began building the canals here in the winter of 1952, and the entire project was completed on June 10 this year. Since May, the water of the Kafuke River has been diverted to the reclaimed area in large quantities, irrigating the 45,000 mu of crops planted by the unit this year. Thanks to this irrigation system, the fraternal ethnic groups in the vicinity engaged in animal husbandry and agricultural production will no longer be threatened by drought.

　  巩乃斯河南岸修建灌溉工程
    新疆生产建设部队某部，在伊犁附近巩乃斯河南岸肥沃的原始荒地上，修建了一处现代化的水利灌溉工程。这个灌溉系统包括有大小建筑物二百二十二座、长十九公里的卡甫克河东干渠、四条支渠和四十七条斗渠。挖填土方约达八十五万立方公尺。整个灌溉系统是按照现代化国营农场规划的要求设计的。干渠每秒的流量为三点五立方公尺，能灌溉农田五万亩。一九五二年冬季，战士们就在这里开始修建渠道，全部工程于今年六月十日竣工。从五月开始，卡甫克河的水已经大量引向垦区，灌溉着部队今年种下的四万五千亩庄稼。由于有了这个灌溉系统，附近从事畜牧和农业生产的各兄弟民族，也不会再受到干旱的威胁了。
