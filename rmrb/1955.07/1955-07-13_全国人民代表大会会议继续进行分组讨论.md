    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued on the 12th with group readings and discussions of the transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commerce sections of the draft First Five-Year Plan. Representative groups that adopted the method of reading before discussion have already discussed the industrial section.

    In the group discussions, the representatives paid particular attention to the construction scale and production targets related to industry, especially heavy industry, in the draft Five-Year Plan, and raised many questions and opinions in this regard. Many representative groups also discussed agricultural and water conservancy construction issues with great concern. Many representatives, in connection with local conditions, believed that, according to the principle of streamlining the upper levels and enriching the lower levels, staff should be transferred from upper-level organs to factories, mines, and rural areas to strengthen grassroots work. Many representatives also believed that in order to ensure the development of industry and agriculture, it is necessary to pay attention to the planned training of young workers, farmers, and students to meet the needs of technical cadres. In the discussions, all representative groups agreed that it is absolutely necessary to vigorously promote comprehensive conservation among the people of the whole country and accumulate funds for socialist construction. The people of the whole country must practice strict economy.

    In recent days, responsible staff members dispatched by the State Council have been providing concentrated explanations on important issues in the draft First Five-Year Plan for labor models, combat heroes, representatives of minority nationalities, etc. in various representative groups. These explanations are divided into seven parts: an overview of the Five-Year Plan, industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, culture and education, and the lives of working people. The fifth part has already been explained today.
