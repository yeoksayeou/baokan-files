Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Planning Commission wrote to accept the criticism published in this newspaper on June 6th, "The Sugar Beet Plan That Changes Daily." They reviewed their shortcomings, including the lack of timely and close communication between relevant departments and insufficient awareness of the seriousness of planning work, and stated that they will work hard to improve their working methods in the future to avoid errors.
    Tong Yun, Director of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce, wrote: The reader's letter page was correct in its criticism of me for purchasing two small cars when I already had a jeep. The reason I made such a mistake was mainly due to the influence of individualism. Because of individualism, I did not consider saving funds. I am engaged in economic work, and this mistake is even more serious on my part. In addition to making a profound self-criticism at the Party meeting, I also made a self-criticism to all employees in the provincial commercial system during the campaign against losses and waste.
    The Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering wrote: Our bureau agrees with the reader's suggestion about widely using wood substitutes (published on page 6 of the People's Daily on May 29th). Although our bureau has instructed its subordinate units to pay attention to the issue of saving wood, the implementation varies from place to place. In the future, our bureau will further consider utilizing wood substitutes as much as possible within its capacity to implement the state's policy of saving wood.
    The Tianjin No. 1 Wire Factory of the First Ministry of Machine Building wrote: The reader's criticism of the serious waste phenomenon in our factory on June 19th in the People's Daily is consistent with the facts. This criticism has powerfully promoted our improvement in future work. Our factory has decided to allocate key responsible personnel to specifically lead the work of opposing waste and practicing strict economy.
    The Shandong Provincial Department of Industry wrote: The reader criticized the low quality of waterwheels produced by the Dezhou Iron Factory on May 22nd in the People's Daily. This criticism is correct. The fundamental reason for the low quality of the factory's products is that the factory leaders have long held capitalist management ideas. Now the factory has expressed its intention to correct its past erroneous ideas and has put forward suggestions for improving future work.
    The Huanglong County People's Committee wrote: The facts revealed in the reader's letter "Why Are You Unwilling to Purchase Buckwheat," published in the June 6th newspaper, are true. We are determined to accept the opinions of the masses and are currently purchasing buckwheat in large quantities.
    After this newspaper published the reader's letter "The Unfortunate Fate of a Batch of Safflower Seeds" on May 1st, the Yuebei Office of the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative wrote to make a self-criticism, stating that it would learn from the lesson and handle the accumulated 150,000 jin of safflower seeds quickly and carefully.
    The Datong Mining Bureau wrote to accept the criticism of "Datong Mining Bureau Relies on Stone Roof Support for Production" in the "Reader's Letter Page" on June 12th. They examined the erroneous thinking of prioritizing quantity over quality in production and decided to take effective measures to improve the quality of coal.
    The Liaoning No. 2 Ceramics Factory wrote: After the "Reader's Letter Page" criticized our factory's problem of stockpiling a large amount of funds on May 29th, we conducted an inspection. The reason why this situation occurred is that the leaders of our factory have bureaucratic work styles and are indifferent to state property. We have now organized forces to carry out sales work and strengthen contact with commercial departments, striving to dispose of the stockpiled products in the near future.
    The No. 1 Production Materials Management Department of the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative wrote to accept the criticism from readers in this newspaper on June 19th (originally titled "A Baffling Thing"). They have ordered the comrades in charge to conduct a profound self-criticism and decided to compensate the Jiangxi Machinery Factory for the losses suffered.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    黑龙江省计划委员会来信接受六月六日本报发表的“朝令夕改的甜菜计划”的批评。他们检讨了各有关部门之间联系不及时、不密切和对计划工作的严肃性认识不足的缺点，并表示今后一定要努力改进工作方法，以避免错误的发生。
    辽宁省商业厅厅长佟云来信：读者来信专页对我有了吉普车又购置两辆小汽车的批评是正确的。我所以会产生这样的错误，主要是个人主义思想在作祟；由于有个人主义思想，也就没有从节约资金方面加以考虑。我是做经济工作的，这个错误发生在我的身上就显得更加严重。我除了在党内会议上作深刻检讨外，并在省商业系统开展反损失反浪费的斗争中向全体职工进行检讨。
    建筑工程部设计总局来信：我局同意读者关于广泛采用木材代用品的建议（刊于五月二十九日人民日报六版）。节约木材问题，虽然我局曾责成所属单位注意，但各地执行情况不同。今后我局当进一步考虑在可能范围内尽量利用木材代用品，贯彻国家节约木材的方针。
    第一机械工业部天津第一电线厂来信：六月十九日人民日报读者对我厂有严重浪费现象的批评是符合事实的。这一批评有力地推动了我们改进今后的工作。我厂已决定抽出主要负责人员来专门领导反对浪费厉行节约的工作。
    山东省工业厅来信：五月二十二日人民日报读者批评了德州铁工厂所产水车质量低劣的情况。这个批评是正确的。这个工厂产品质量低劣的根本原因是工厂领导人员长期以来存在着资本主义经营思想。现在这个工厂已表示要纠正过去的错误思想，并且提出了改进今后工作的意见。
    黄龙县人民委员会来信：六月六日报上发表“为什么不肯收购荞麦”的读者来信中所揭发的事实是确实的。我们决心接受群众的意见，目前正在大量收购荞麦。
    本报在五月一日发表了“一批红花种籽遭到的厄运”的读者来信以后，广东省供销合作社粤北办事处已来信检讨，表示要接受教训，迅速地、谨慎地处理积存的十五万斤红花种籽。
    大同矿务局来信接受六月十二日“读者来信专页”中“大同矿务局依靠石头顶产量”的批评。他们检查了生产中重量轻质的错误思想，并且决定采取有效措施来提高煤的质量。
    辽宁陶瓷二厂来信：五月二十九日“读者来信专页”对我厂积压大量资金的问题提出批评后，我们就进行了检查。这种情况之所以发生，是因为我厂领导人员有着官僚主义作风和对国家财产漠不关心。我们现在已经组织力量进行推销工作，并且加强同商业部门的联系；争取在最近期间把积压的产品处理完毕。
    广东省供销合作社生产资料第一经营管理处来信接受六月十九日本报读者的批评（原题是“一件莫名其妙的事情”）。他们已经责成经办的同志进行深刻检讨；并决定偿付江西机械厂所受的损失。
