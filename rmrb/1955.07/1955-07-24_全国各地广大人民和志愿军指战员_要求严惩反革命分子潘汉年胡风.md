The broad masses of people across the country and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers unanimously support the correct measure of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in approving the arrest and trial of the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, and demand that the government severely punish these counter-revolutionary elements.

In Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Xinjiang and other places, many factories, agricultural producers' cooperatives, schools and other units held forums. Representatives from all walks of life delivered speeches expressing their extreme indignation at the counter-revolutionary criminal activities of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. Li Yuchang, chairman of the trade union of the Xinzhongguo Flour Mill in Baoding, said at the forum: "We are all busy with production and building the motherland, but counter-revolutionary elements like Pan Hannian and Hu Feng are trying their best to sabotage. We must uproot all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the victorious completion of the socialist construction cause." Liu Herong, deputy director of the Qianjin Second Vegetable Production Cooperative in the sixth district of Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, and others expressed that they would learn from the lessons, raise their vigilance, and strictly guard against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives and so on. Lu Kanru, vice president of Shandong University, said: "Pan Hannian, Hu Feng and other reactionary guys vainly attempted to undermine our cause from within and act as Chiang Kai-shek's special forces. It is urgent to severely punish them according to law. We should also increase our vigilance a hundredfold through this incident, so that all counter-revolutionary elements have nowhere to hide."

Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Guangdong, Anhui, Liaoning and other places have successively made speeches or written letters to local newspapers, expressing that they will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Wu Zhongxi, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The timely arrest and trial of Pan Hannian, Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated our 'liver' is completely in line with the demands of the people of the whole country. We not only support this measure, but also resolutely fight to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements." Peng Shaonong, a representative of the National People's Congress and director of the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, who did not attend this session of the National People's Congress due to health reasons, said: At this time when the class struggle is becoming increasingly acute, it is necessary to plug the loopholes for counter-revolutionary sabotage. Our business community must strengthen ideological remolding, prevent counter-revolutionary elements from using us to achieve counter-revolutionary sabotage, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements within the business community.

When the news of the arrest of the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng reached the various units of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the broad masses of commanders and fighters were very excited. They unanimously believed that this was another major victory for the people of the motherland in the struggle against the hidden class enemies in the course of socialist construction. Wang Zhanshan, a second-class hero, first-class meritorious person, and third platoon leader of a certain unit, said: "The exposure of these counter-revolutionary elements' conspiracies fully proves that as long as we are always vigilant, no matter how concealed and cunning the methods of the counter-revolutionary elements are, they will never escape the giant palm of the people!" Commanders and fighters of the fifth company of a certain unit guarding the front-line position near Shangganling expressed during the forum that they would increase their vigilance a hundredfold, guard their positions, strengthen their studies, and improve their ability to fight against the enemy.

    本报讯　全国各地广大人民和中国人民志愿军广大指战员，一致拥护全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准把反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判的正确措施，并要求政府严厉惩办这些反革命分子。
    河北、山东、四川、新疆等地许多工厂、农业生产合作社和学校等单位举行座谈会，各界代表人物纷纷发表谈话，对潘汉年、胡风的反革命罪恶活动表示极大的愤慨。保定新中国面粉厂工会主席李玉昌在座谈会上说：“我们都在忙着搞生产，建设祖国，像潘汉年、胡风这样的反革命分子却在千方百计地进行破坏。我们必须把一切暗藏的反革命分子连根拔掉，保证社会主义建设事业的胜利完成。”辽宁省锦州市郊第六区前进第二蔬菜生产合作社副主任刘鹤荣等表示要吸取教训，提高警惕，在建立农业生产合作社等工作中，严防反革命分子的破坏活动。山东大学副校长陆侃如说：“潘汉年、胡风这些反动家伙妄想从内部破坏我们的事业，做蒋贼的别动队。依法严办他们，是刻不容缓的事情。我们还应该通过这一事件百倍提高警觉，使一切反革命分子没有藏身之所。”
    广东、安徽、辽宁等地各民主党派地方组织和人民团体的负责人，纷纷发表谈话或写信给当地报社，表示要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。中国国民党革命委员会广东省委员会副主任委员吴仲禧说：“及时逮捕审判潘汉年、胡风这些钻进我们‘肝脏里’的反革命分子，完全符合全国人民的要求。我们不仅拥护这一措施，还要坚决为肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子而斗争。”因健康关系没有出席这次全国人民代表大会会议的全国人民代表大会代表、四川省工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员彭劭农说：在这阶级斗争越来越尖锐的时候，必须堵塞反革命破坏的漏洞。我们工商界要加强思想改造，防止反革命分子利用我们达到反革命破坏的目的，并要把工商界内一切暗藏的反革命分子清除出去。
    逮捕潘汉年、胡风反革命分子的消息传到志愿军各部队时，广大指战员都非常兴奋。他们一致认为这是祖国人民在进行社会主义建设中和隐藏的阶级敌人进行斗争的又一重大胜利。某部二级英雄、一等功臣、第三排排长王占山说：“这些反革命分子的阴谋被揭露，充分证明了只要我们时刻提高警惕，不管反革命分子的手法怎样隐蔽和狡猾，总是逃不出人民的巨掌！”守卫在上甘岭附近的前沿阵地上的某部第五连的指战员们在座谈时，纷纷表示要百倍提高警惕，严守阵地，加强学习，提高对敌斗争的本领。
