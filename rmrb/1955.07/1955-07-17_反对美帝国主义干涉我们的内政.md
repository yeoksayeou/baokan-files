    Oppose US Imperialist Interference in Our Internal Affairs
    By Yu. Shabo, Foreman of the Budapest Steel Plant, Hungary

    In recent weeks, US imperialist elements have been constantly clamoring to change the social systems of the people's democratic countries—including Hungary—and have indicated that they intend to raise this issue at the upcoming Four Power Conference in Geneva. Whenever I hear such clamor, I cannot help but clench my fists in anger. Millions of people in our country share the same feeling. We unanimously and resolutely declare: No interference in our people's democratic system! Supported by the powerful united strength of the peace and democracy camp, we are determined to stop every attempt by the imperialists against our country.

    For us, the working people of Hungary, the people's democratic system is of paramount importance. It means that after centuries of oppression and countless bloody struggles, we have finally gained freedom and independence and become masters of our own destiny. It means that land belongs to the working peasants. Hungarian workers are no longer subjected to exploitation by foreign and domestic capitalists, but work for the socialist industrialization of the country.

    At the beginning of this century, when I was very young, there were tens of thousands of illiterate people in our country. After finishing the fourth grade of elementary school, I had no opportunity to continue my studies. In order to make a living, I was forced to leave school. Now, every Hungarian boy and girl must complete eight grades of elementary school. Illiteracy in Hungary has been eliminated. My eldest son is now in university, preparing to become an engineer.

    US imperialist elements are afraid of the truth. While peddling war, they continue to talk empty words about peace. When they attempt to subvert the regimes of other people, they call it "liberation." We all understand very well what this so-called "liberation" policy is. This so-called "liberation" brings destruction and massacre to the people, razes the towns and villages of Korea to the ground, forcibly occupies Taiwan, prolongs the reactionary rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, interferes in the Vietnam War, obstructs the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and hinders Vietnam's reunification through free elections.

    We, the Hungarian people, have long tasted the so-called "liberation" policy of the US imperialists. American agents instigated sabotage in our country, hindering the production of the extremely important West Hungarian oil industry in our national economy. Saboteurs subsidized by imperialist elements tried their best to undermine the efforts of our working people in the Standard Radio Factory. Recently, another group of spies and saboteurs supported by imperialist elements has been exposed and brought to justice in Hungary. We, the Hungarian people, have reason to repeat: we definitely do not want this "liberation" that only brings destruction and devastation and makes us lose our hard-won achievements. Those US imperialist elements are attempting to interfere with and threaten our cherished right to self-determination, the right to manage our destiny in the manner desired by the vast majority of our nationals.

    We, the Hungarian people, believe that for our future, we need to cooperate peacefully with all countries. We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, regardless of their social system.

    Our newly built cities and rebuilt capital, our large industrial enterprises and cultural construction, the People's Stadium in Budapest with a capacity of 100,000 people, and all other achievements of peaceful construction speak for themselves. These eloquently prove that a country can create history, can build some permanent undertakings in a few short years, as long as they do not spend their strength on war preparations but concentrate their strength on creative plans for peace.

    We have demonstrated our sincere desire to cooperate with all countries not only in words but also in deeds. At present, our country maintains diplomatic relations with thirty-four countries, and our People's Republic has trade relations with virtually every country in the world.

    We are working for peace and effective international cooperation. But at the same time, we firmly oppose interference in our internal affairs by other countries. We have a firm and unwavering belief that we must safeguard our freedom, independence, and the right to people's self-determination. We will use all our strength to oppose the attempts of the imperialists to destroy our country, our people, and the people's democratic system we have chosen for ourselves.

    Our people support the foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Republic, which is a policy of peace, resolutely defending our independence and the people's democratic system. This policy is powerful because we are not isolated: the powerful camp of peace and democracy, including the 600 million heroic Chinese people, is with us; all peace-loving people in the world support us. Peace-loving people are becoming more united in their opposition to the US imperialist "policy of strength" of assembling military blocs, frantically preparing for war, and preparing for atomic warfare. Today, the people of the world are condemning the imperialist attempts to aggravate international tensions and continue the "cold war."

    We, the entire Hungarian people, are determined to spare no effort in the struggle against the imperialist plans for aggression. We must defend our freedom, independence, and the people's democratic system. We sincerely hope and believe that this struggle is also a contribution to the cause of peace and international cooperation.

    反对美帝国主义干涉我们的内政
    匈牙利布达佩斯钢铁厂领班　约·沙波
    最近几个星期以来，美帝国主义分子不断地叫嚣要改变人民民主国家——包括匈牙利在内——的社会制度，并且表示要把这个问题提到即将在日内瓦举行的四大国会议上去。每当我听到这种叫嚣的时候，我总是愤怒得不禁握紧了我自己的拳头。我国的几百万人民也和我有同样的感觉。我们一致地坚决声明：不许干涉我国的人民民主制度！我们有着和平民主阵营强大团结力量的支援，决心制止帝国主义者反对我国的每种打算。
    对我们匈牙利的劳动人民来说，人民民主制度是有着非常重要的意义的。它意味着经过几世纪的被压迫和无数次的浴血斗争后，我们终于获得了自由和独立，并成为自己命运的主人。它意味着土地归属于劳动农民。匈牙利工人从此不再遭受外国和本国的资本家的剥削，而为国家的社会主义工业化工作。
    在本世纪的初叶，当我还很年轻的时候，我国有成千成万个文盲。我在读完初小四年级以后，就没有机会继续求学了。为了自谋衣食，被迫离开了学校。现在，每个匈牙利的男女孩子必须读完初等学校八年级。匈牙利的文盲已被扫除。我的长子现在在上大学，他准备成为一个工程师。
    美帝国主义分子害怕真理，他们一边贩卖战争，一边继续空谈和平。他们企图颠覆别国人民自己的政权的时候，把这叫做“解放”。我们都很清楚懂得这所谓的“解放”政策是什么。这种所谓“解放”，就是给人们带来毁灭和屠杀，把朝鲜的城乡夷为平地，对台湾的强占，苟延蒋介石卖国贼的反动统治，干涉越南战争，阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决，和阻挠越南经过自由的选举恢复统一。
    我们匈牙利人民早就尝够了美帝国主义者的所谓“解放”政策的滋味。美国代理人在我国策动怠工，阻碍我国国民经济中极重要的西部匈牙利石油工业的生产。受到帝国主义分子津贴的怠工者，极力破坏标准无线电工厂中我国劳动人民的努力。最近，帝国主义分子支持的另外一伙间谍和怠工者在匈牙利已被揭露并被送交司法机关审理。我们匈牙利人民有理由再重复一句：我们决不要这种只会带来破坏和毁灭、使我们丧失已获得的成就的“解放”。那些美帝国主义分子企图干涉和威胁我们所珍贵的自决权、按我国绝大多数国民所愿意的形式处理我国命运的权利。
    我们匈牙利人民认为，为了我们的将来，我们需要同所有国家和睦合作。我们不想干涉任何国家的内政，不管这些国家的社会制度是怎样的。
    我们的新建城市和重建的首都，我们的大工业企业和文化建设，布达佩斯可容十万人的人民体育场以及所有其他和平建设的成就说明了一切。这些雄辩地证明了：一个国家能够创造历史，能在短短的几年里建立一些永久性的事业，只要他们不把力量花费在备战上而把力量集中在为了和平的创造性计划上。
    我们不仅在口头上，而且也用行动说明了我们同各国合作的真诚愿望。目前，我国和三十四个国家保持着外交关系，我们的人民共和国实际上和世界上的每个国家有着贸易往来。
    我们正在为和平和有效的国际合作而努力。但是同时，我们坚决反对其他国家干涉我国内政。我们怀有坚决和不可动摇的信念，一定要维护我们的自由、独立和人民自决的权利。我们要以所有力量来反对帝国主义者破坏我们的国家、我国人民和我们自己选择的人民民主制度的企图。
    我国人民拥护匈牙利人民共和国政府的外交政策，这是一种和平的、坚决保卫我们的独立和人民民主制度的政策。这种政策之所以有力，是因为我们并不是孤立的：强大的和平民主阵营，包括六亿英勇的中国人民在内，是同我们在一起的；全世界一切爱好和平的人民支持着我们。爱好和平的人民由于反对美帝国主义拼凑军事集团、疯狂备战和准备原子战争的“实力政策”而更加团结了。今天全世界人民都在谴责帝国主义分子加剧国际紧张局势和继续从事“冷战”的企图。
    我们匈牙利全国人民决心不遗余力地为反对帝国主义的侵略计划而斗争。我们要保卫我们的自由、独立和人民民主制度。我们衷心地希望并相信，这个斗争也是对和平和国际合作事业的一个贡献。
