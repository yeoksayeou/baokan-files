Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 30th: The Japanese people are actively preparing for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which they initiated.

The Standing Committee of the conference's preparatory committee held a meeting in Tokyo on June 28th and decided on the conference's schedule and content. The committee decided that the world conference would open on August 6th in Hiroshima, the tenth anniversary of the United States' atomic bombing of Hiroshima, with a plenary session. From August 7th to 9th, there will be group meetings to discuss two major issues: "The Threat of Atomic Weapons" and "How to Conduct the Movement Against the Preparation of Atomic Warfare." August 10th to 12th will be spent investigating Nagasaki, another Japanese city bombed by the U.S. with an atomic bomb, and visiting other cities. Finally, the conference will conclude on August 15th in Tokyo with a "Great Peace Festival."

In order to raise funds for the conference, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than three million members, and more than one hundred mass organizations from various sectors such as trade unions, women, and religion, will launch a "Donation Month" across the country in July. The first batch of 30,000 "August 6th" commemorative badges sold by the preparatory committee's secretariat to raise funds sold out within a week, and there are still many people who want to buy them.

The conference preparatory committee has already sent invitations to peace movement leaders and prominent figures in thirty-five countries, including the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, France, and India, to attend the conference. At the same time, this conference has also received the support of the people of the world. The Asian Countries Conference and the World Peace Conference have called on the people of Asia and the world to jointly commemorate the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. Peace groups in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have written to the Japanese preparatory committee expressing their determination to participate in the conference in Hiroshima.

　　日本人民筹备禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日本人民正在积极筹备他们发起的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。
    大会筹备会的常任委员会六月二十八日在东京举行会议，决定了大会的日程和内容。这个委员会决定，世界大会将在美国用原子弹轰炸日本广岛的十周年纪念日——今年八月六日在广岛市开幕，举行全体会议；八月七日到九日举行分组会，讨论“原子武器的威胁”和“反对准备原子战争运动的进行方法”两大问题；八月十日到十二日考察日本遭受美国原子弹轰炸的另一个城市——长崎和参观其他城市；最后在八月十五日在东京举行“大和平节”后宣告大会闭幕。
    为了替大会筹募基金，拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会和其他工会组织以及妇女、宗教等各界一百多个群众团体，七月间将在全国各地展开“募捐月”。筹备会秘书处为筹集基金而出售的第一批共三万个“八·六”纪念章，在一个星期内就卖完了，而且还有很多人想买。
    大会筹备会已经向苏联、中国、美国、英国、法国、印度等三十五个国家的和平运动领袖和著名人士发出参加大会的邀请。同时，这个大会也得到了世界人民的支持。亚洲国家会议和世界和平大会已经号召亚洲和世界人民共同来纪念广岛被炸十周年。加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰的和平团体已经写信给日本的筹备会，表示他们一定要到广岛参加大会。
