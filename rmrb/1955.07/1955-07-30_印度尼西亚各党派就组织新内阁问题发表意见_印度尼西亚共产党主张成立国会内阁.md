The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement to the press on the 26th, advocating for the establishment of a parliamentary cabinet and opposing a presidential cabinet that is not responsible to the parliament.

The statement called on the Indonesian people to remain vigilant, strengthen unity to prevent provocation, defend democracy, and oppose foreign interference.

The Political Cooperation Committee, composed of many smaller parties, issued a statement on the 27th, believing that the cabinet crisis should be resolved based on the principle of safeguarding national independence and maintaining the unity of the state apparatus, especially maintaining the unity of the armed forces, and in accordance with the constitution and the parliamentary democratic system.
