Bierut gave a speech at the airport, expressing his gratitude for the warm and friendly reception from the government and working people of the German Democratic Republic.

The talks between the Polish government delegation and the political leaders of the German Democratic Republic showed the mutual understanding and unanimity of our two neighboring countries on fundamental international issues and issues related to the two countries. Our people's trust in the progressive forces of the German people is correct. We regard the German Democratic Republic as an organized and increasingly powerful fortress of the democratic forces among the German people. Therefore, we will resolutely develop and strengthen our friendship and cooperation with the German Democratic Republic.
