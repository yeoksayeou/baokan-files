　　Defective Medicines Should Not Leave the Factory
　　Editor:
　　The Liangping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Sichuan Province often has to handle returns in its new drug business. There have been dozens of instances of returns since January of this year. For example, the discontinued Xiehe Pharmaceutical Factory's 50-ampoule, 10 ml batch number H-2-6 distilled water injection, and Yang's brand new sodium arsphenamine batch numbers 5411 and 5412, etc. The reason for the returns is that the medicines were found to be substandard upon inspection. These discontinued and returned drugs were all transported from Shanghai and other distant places, and now to return them from Liangping to the original factory would be such a waste! Whether or not medicines meet specifications is related to the life safety and health of the people of the whole country. I hope that relevant departments will strengthen the drug inspection system and not sell substandard medicines casually.

### 不应让不合规格的药品出厂

　  不应让不合规格的药品出厂编辑同志：
    四川省梁平县供销合作社在经营新药业务的工作中，经常要办理退货手续。今年一月份以来发生退货的情况就有几十起。如停用协和药厂五十支装十毫升批号H—2—6之蒸馏水注射液及杨氏出品新苯钠胂批号五四一一、五四一二等等。退货的原因都是药品经检查不合规格。这些停用和退回的药物都是从上海等很远的地方运来的，现在要从梁平退回原厂，该是多大的浪费啊！药品是否合乎规格，关系到全国人民的生命安全和健康，希望有关部门加强对药品的检验制度，不要把不合规格的药品随便出售。　　　王国度
