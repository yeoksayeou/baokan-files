Report on the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China
    ——At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on July 16, 1955
    Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China
    Fellow Deputies:
    The Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, which is now submitted for discussion to the National People's Congress, was first revised and approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in February 1955 and resolved to be issued by the State Council to the people's committees at all levels and the broad masses of the people for discussion and suggestions for revision. It was then revised and approved by the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the State Council in July 1955.
    The military service system is a major issue concerning the interests of the people and national security. When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, it was determined that our country must implement the principle of compulsory military service. Article 23 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Prepare to implement compulsory military service at an appropriate time." In order to draft laws for the implementation of compulsory military service, a drafting committee for the Military Service Law was established in March 1953 under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government. The drafting committee studied the relevant situation in our country, solicited opinions from relevant departments, referred to the military service laws of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and after discussions and research by the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Political and Legal Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the first draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China was drawn up in November 1954. This initial draft was discussed and approved by the National Defense Commission on December 9, 1954, and submitted to the State Council. On December 16, 1954, it was discussed and approved by the Third Plenary Session of the State Council and submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation. On February 7, 1955, the Fifth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress discussed and revised this draft and decided that the State Council would issue the revised draft to people's committees at all levels for discussion and to solicit the opinions of the people. After the State Council summarized the discussions and opinions solicited from the people's committees at all levels, the draft was revised and supplemented once again, and discussed and approved by the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the State Council on July 4, 1955, and is now submitted to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for review and approval.
    The basic task of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China is to replace the voluntary military service system, which is no longer suitable for the current and future needs, with the compulsory military service system, in accordance with the urgent requirements of the state and the people.
    The people's voluntary military service system played an important role in winning the victory of revolutionary wars in China's past revolutionary war periods, and it was also the only feasible and excellent system at that time. During the long revolutionary wars, under the call and leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of our country enthusiastically and voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army in order to oppose the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, ensuring the continuous replenishment and constant growth of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers who joined the People's Liberation Army were all outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. From the day they joined the army, they established the determination and confidence to fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, and regarded being a people's revolutionary soldier as a glorious revolutionary cause. They worked hard, were not afraid of difficulties and dangers, did not care about personal gains or losses, were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, and fought bravely. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in "On Coalition Government": "The reason why this army is powerful is that all those who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they are not for the private interests of a few people or narrow groups, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and the interests of the entire nation, and they are united and fighting. Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the only purpose of this army. Under this purpose, this army has a spirit of advancing bravely, it must overwhelm all enemies, and it will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and arduous the occasion, as long as there is one person left, this person will continue to fight." It was precisely because the Chinese people had undergone long-term revolutionary war training and gained rich experience in conducting revolutionary armed struggle that it was possible for the Chinese people to form a powerful Chinese People's Volunteer Army to assist the Korean people in resisting the aggression of US imperialism, and with a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and heroic and decisive actions, to cooperate with the great Korean people and the Korean People's Army to achieve the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.
    However, the voluntary military service system, due to the lack of a regular conscription and demobilization system, is not conducive to accumulating a strong reserve force that has undergone training, and it is no longer suitable for the current needs of our country. The armed forces of our country are currently shouldering the huge task of defending the motherland, and are required to continuously improve their combat effectiveness. Article 20 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people, and their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the country." According to the current situation in our country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship internally, actively prepare forces to liberate the territory of the motherland, Taiwan, and complete the great cause of liberating all of China; externally, it must defend against imperialist aggression, defend our country's socialist construction cause, and defend the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In order to shoulder this sacred task entrusted by the people of the whole country and stipulated by the Constitution, we must quickly establish powerful modernized armed forces; we must not only have a powerful army, but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy. Powerful armed forces do not rely on maintaining an excessively large number of active troops in peacetime, which is not only detrimental to the people's production and national construction, but also has limited military significance; powerful armed forces mainly rely on the combination of a strong active force and a strong reserve force. This situation requires our country to quickly implement a military service system suitable for the needs of modern national defense construction, to implement a regular conscription and demobilization system, that is to say, to implement compulsory military service.
    Only by implementing compulsory military service can our country accumulate a strong reserve force year by year. Because the implementation of compulsory military service means that there is a regular conscription and regular demobilization system, every year a group of soldiers who have completed their active service in the People's Liberation Army and have been tempered by actual military life are demobilized and transferred to the first category of reserves, and every year a large number of citizens who meet the conditions for active service but have not been conscripted are incorporated into the second category of reserves. At the same time, every year officers who have completed their active service are transferred to the officer reserve, and a large number of reserve officers are also cultivated and accumulated from schools and from non-military state organs and enterprises. With a large number of well-trained reserve personnel and a sufficient number of reserve officers, and with the material guarantee of the growing socialist state industry, we are not afraid of any enemy's aggression. Once imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, we will be able to quickly form a sufficient number of troops on this solid foundation, give a resolute counterattack, and defend the security of the country. It is precisely because of this that we can appropriately reduce the number of active troops in peacetime, save manpower and financial resources, concentrate on the country's socialist industrialization construction, and lay a solid technical and economic foundation for the modernization of national defense. From this, it can be seen that the implementation of compulsory military service is an indispensable task in the overall task of our country during the transition period.
    The implementation of compulsory military service is not only an urgent need for national construction, but also a universal demand of the people of our country. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the masses of the people wrote letters to state organs, expressing their firm support for the provisions of Article 103 of the Constitution, demanding the rapid implementation of compulsory military service, and demanding that the broad masses of young people be given the opportunity to reasonably fulfill their military service obligations and take turns shouldering the task of defending the motherland. In November 1954, the State Council decided to conduct a pilot conscription and replenishment of troops in 25 provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region according to the principle of compulsory military service, and at the same time carry out publicity on the principle of compulsory military service, which was warmly supported by the people in various places. During the pilot conscription of troops, many young women went on stage to give speeches, encouraging their relatives to sign up for enlistment, many old people boasted everywhere because their sons were approved to serve in the army, and many young people who were approved to serve in the army were so excited that they could not sleep for several nights. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces alone, there were 80,000 cases of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, fiancées sending their fiancés, and brothers vying to sign up. Therefore, the number of people who signed up for enlistment nationwide reached more than 10,032,000, while the actual number of conscripted people was only more than 830,000; at the same time, the number of demobilized people from 1954 to the present has exceeded 1,570,000. These new recruits all have political consciousness and generally believe that military service is a glorious obligation. After the draft amendment to the Military Service Law was promulgated in February 1955, the Ministry of National Defense received more than 15,000 letters from patriotic youth in various places requesting to join the army from February to May, of which 96.5 percent were young people from factories, schools, and organs. Some people wrote seven or eight or even more than ten letters in a row, and some people also attached photos, physical examination forms, and guarantees from their loved ones in their letters. Because Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin were not assigned the task of conscripting troops in 1954, the young people in these three cities wrote the most letters. Please allow me to read a letter from Xu Qingyuan, a young man from Tianjin, to the Ministry of National Defense! The letter said:
    "I am once again talking to you about my aspirations. This is the twelfth application to join the army.
    I am twenty years old this year and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. I am currently an employee of the Sixth Construction Engineering Company in Tianjin.
    I was born in a poor farmer's family and lived a miserable life since I was a child, running around, collecting firewood and cutting grass. Because our area is an old liberated area, I also studied for a few years. After graduating from elementary school, I farmed at home because of the difficult life in my family. I joined the work in 1952.
    I have had a wish since I was a child: when I grow up, I am determined to be a soldier of the national defense army -- an air force pilot!
    In my memory, it was still during the Anti-Japanese War when a fierce battle took place in our village. There was an Eighth Route Army uncle, he was a machine gun shooter in the machine gun squad, and he lived in our house. I am very familiar with him, he loves me very much, and I respect him very much. Although it was only four or five days, his gentle and kind attitude made me never forget him. After the battle, the unfortunate thing was that I learned that he had gloriously sacrificed his life for the cause of the liberation of mankind! Farewell to the people forever. At that time, I stood next to his body and shed a few tears of farewell. I secretly swore: Dear Uncle! I will definitely join the Eighth Route Army in the future and be determined to avenge you! From that time on, my wish to be a pilot in the People's Air Force was generated, and it was also doomed. Until now, I have never given up my idea of being an air force pilot.
    I am determined to be a soldier of the national defense army to defend the motherland, and I am determined to let the revolutionary red flag inserted into Taiwan be attached to a drop of my blood.
    I once again request you to approve me to be one of your soldiers, and it is better to go to the preparatory aviation school one day earlier. I have a strong body and strong courage, and I will definitely be able to shoulder the task of defending the motherland. I am willing to dedicate my youth, my light and heat, to the great People's Liberation Army."
    This young man's letter represents the reaction of the broad masses of the people and the broad masses of young people to the Military Service Law. Our country has countless such young people who are loyal to the country, which is the most powerful guarantee for our country to implement the Military Service Law, and this is the most powerful guarantee for consolidating the national defense of the motherland.
    The Military Service Law of the People’s Republic of China, like other laws of our country, is based on the interests and awareness of the people, and it is essentially different from the military service laws of imperialist countries and the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The state power of imperialism only represents the interests of a few capitalists, and the armies of imperialist countries are tools used to suppress the working people and carry out aggression against foreign countries. Therefore, the military service system of imperialist countries is completely opposed to the interests of the working people. The so-called military service law during the Kuomintang reactionary rule was also a tool against the people. Therefore, what the Kuomintang implemented was still forced drafting and conscription. Our military service law is a law for the people of our country to fulfill their military service obligations in order to consolidate their national defense and protect their own interests. Therefore, the people of our country actively support this law and regard serving in the military to defend the motherland as their glorious obligation and sacred right.
    The people of our country are working selflessly to build our country into a great socialist country. We need peace. We have never had and will never have the idea of invading other countries. We do not need to expand the army. On the contrary, in the process of implementing compulsory military service, we have already and will continue to reduce the size of our army in order to save the country's manpower and financial resources to develop the socialist economy and improve the material and cultural life of the people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have demobilized more than 4,510,000 people from the army. We warmly support the proposal put forward by the Soviet government on May10, 1955, on the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war. We also fully support the Soviet government’ s proposal to convene a world-wide disarmament and prohibition of atomic weapons conference no later than the first half of 1956 with the participation of both UN member states and non-member states. If this conference can be held and an agreement is reached on the basis of the Soviet government’s proposals, the Chinese government is willing to further reduce its army.
    The people and government of our country have made and are continuing to make unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, eliminate the threat of war, and guarantee world peace. But we cannot forget for a moment that the US aggressor group is still doing everything possible to obstruct our people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, and is threatening us with new large-scale plans for wars of aggression. Warmongers are threatening all of humanity with atomic weapons, attempting to achieve their goal of enslaving the entire world. We love peace, but if imperialism insists on inflicting the disasters of war on the people of our country and infringing on our territory and sovereignty, we will never be afraid of war, and we will never sacrifice our territory and sovereignty in exchange for peace. It is precisely because of this that we must resolutely and rapidly implement compulsory military service and strengthen our national defense in all aspects so as to be constantly prepared to use sufficient force to defend our country's independence and world peace.
    After the draft amendment to the Military Service Law was promulgated, people's committees and people's organizations at all levels conducted heated discussions. In addition to the provisions in the draft regarding military service obligations, peacetime conscription age and term of service, active duty and reserve duty for non-commissioned officers and soldiers, active duty and reserve duty for officers, rights and obligations of active duty soldiers and reserve soldiers, wartime conscription, and military training for students in senior high schools and above, it was unanimously agreed that these provisions were appropriate. More than 3,000 suggestions for revisions to the text and content were also put forward. The State Council has made some revisions to the content and text of the original draft based on these suggestions. For example: the original draft had a total of 57 articles, and now one article has been added, for a total of 58 articles; the first sentence of Article 15 and the last paragraph of Article 7 of the original draft have been merged into Article 8 of the current draft; the words "women" in the original draft have been uniformly changed to "female citizens"; Articles 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 33, 38, and 52 of the original draft have all been revised in terms of text or content based on suggestions. We believe that after being revised based on these suggestions, the draft is more perfect.
    Fellow Deputies: The enactment and implementation of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China is a major reform in our country's military system, a major event related to our country's security and the lives of the people of the whole country, and a further manifestation of the common desire and firm will of the people of our country to defend the motherland, defend peace, and oppose imperialist aggression. The broad masses of the people throughout the country have already expressed their support for the implementation of compulsory military service with practical actions. Of course, this does not mean that our publicity work and organizational work for the implementation of the Military Service Law have been done perfectly, and that we will not encounter any misunderstandings and lack of understanding, and that we will not encounter any rumors and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. No, that is not the case. Because compulsory military service is still a new system in our country, we especially need to carry out the most extensive and detailed publicity among the masses of the people in the early stage of the implementation of the Military Service Law, truly making it known to every household, and to be vigilant against counter-revolutionary saboteurs, and to expose and strike at the conspiracies and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in a timely manner. Relying on the awareness of the broad masses of the people throughout the country, and relying on the efforts of state organs and people's organizations at all levels throughout the country, we firmly believe that the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China will be smoothly implemented, and the people throughout the country will actively support and implement the various provisions of the Military Service Law, and resolutely strive to build a powerful national defense army, to consolidate national defense, and to defend our great motherland.

    关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告
    ——在一九五五年七月十六日的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长　彭德怀各位代表：
    现在提交全国人民代表大会讨论的中华人民共和国兵役法草案，是一九五五年二月经全国人民代表大会常务委员会作第一次修正通过，并决议交由国务院发给，交全国各级人民委员会和广大人民讨论，提出修改意见，又经一九五五年七月国务院全体会议第十四次会议修正通过的。
    兵役制度是关系人民利益和国家安全的重大问题。当一九四九年中华人民共和国成立的时候，就确定了我国必须实行义务兵役制的原则。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十三条规定：“准备在适当时机实行义务兵役制。”为了起草实行义务兵役制的法律，还在一九五三年三月，就在中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的领导下，成立了兵役法起草委员会。起草委员会研究了我国的有关情况，征求了有关部门的意见，参考了苏联和各人民民主国家的兵役法，并先后经过中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会政法组座谈研究，在一九五四年十一月拟出了中华人民共和国兵役法草案初稿。这个初稿，在一九五四年十二月九日经国防委员会讨论通过后，提交国务院。一九五四年十二月十六日经国务院全体会议第三次会议的讨论和通过，提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。一九五五年二月七日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第五次会议讨论和修正了这个草案，并决定由国务院将修正草案发给各级人民委员会讨论和征求人民意见。国务院把各级人民委员会讨论和征求的意见汇总后，将草案又作了一次修正和补充，并经一九五五年七月四日国务院全体会议第十四次会议讨论通过，现在提请全国人民代表大会第二次会议审查通过。
    中华人民共和国兵役法的基本任务，就是按照目前国家和人民的迫切要求，用义务兵役制代替已不适合于现时和今后需要的志愿兵制。
    人民的志愿兵制，在中国过去各个革命战争时期，对争取革命战争的胜利起了重要的作用，也是在当时唯一可行的优良制度。在长期的革命战争中，我国人民在中国共产党的号召和领导之下，为了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，踊跃地、自愿地加入了人民解放军，保证了人民解放军的源源补充和不断壮大。参加人民解放军的战士都是中国人民的优秀儿女。他们从参军的一天起，就树立了为中国人民的解放事业奋斗到底的决心和信心，把当一个人民革命战士作为一种光荣的革命事业。他们不辞劳苦，不畏艰险，不计个人得失，不怕流血牺牲，英勇奋斗。正如毛泽东主席在“论联合政府”一书中所说的：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合、而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。在这个宗旨下面，这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”我国人民就是依靠这样一支具有坚强革命意志的、全心全意为人民服务的军队，在中国共产党领导下，经过长期的艰苦的斗争，彻底推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。正是由于中国人民经过长期革命战争的锻炼，取得了进行革命的武装斗争的丰富经验，中国人民才有可能为协助朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义的侵略而组成了强大的中国人民志愿军，以高度的爱国主义、国际主义精神和英勇果敢的行动，配合伟大的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军取得了抗美援朝斗争的胜利。
    但是志愿兵制度由于缺乏定期的征集和退伍制度，不便于积蓄强大的经过训练的预备兵员，已经不能适合于我国目前的需要了。我国的武装力量目前不但担负着巨大的保卫祖国的任务，而且要求不断提高自己的战斗力。中华人民共和国宪法第二十条规定：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全。”根据我国当前情况，中国人民解放军对内必须努力巩固人民民主专政，积极准备力量解放祖国的领土台湾，完成解放全中国的大业；对外必须防御帝国主义的侵略，保卫我国的社会主义建设事业，保卫国家的主权和领土完整。为了担负起全国人民所赋予的为宪法所规定的这种神圣任务，我们必需迅速建立起强大的现代化的武装力量；不但要有一支强大的陆军，而且要有一支强大的空军和一支强大的海军。强大的武装力量并不依靠在平时保持过分庞大的现役军队的人数，这不但不利于人民的生产和国家的建设，而且在军事上的意义也是有限的；强大的武装力量，主要地依靠强大的现役兵员和强大的预备役兵员相结合。这种情况就要求我国迅速实行适合于现代国防建设需要的兵役制度，实行定期的征集和退伍制度，也就是说，实行义务兵役制。
    只有实行义务兵役制，我国才能够逐年地积蓄起强大的预备役兵员的力量。因为实行了义务兵役制，就有了定期征集和定期退伍制度，每年都有一批在人民解放军部队服现役期满的、经过军队实际生活锻炼的士兵退伍，转入第一类预备役，每年都有大批具备服现役条件、而未被征集服现役的公民编入第二类预备役。同时，每年都有服现役期满的军官转入军官预备役，也有从学校里，从非军事系统的国家机关、企业里，培养和积蓄起来的大量的预备役军官。我们有了大量的训练有素的预备役兵员和足够数量的预备役军官，我们有了正在成长的社会主义国家工业的物质保证，我们就不怕任何敌人的侵略。一旦帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，我们就能够在这种雄厚的基础上迅速地组成足够数量的军队，给予坚决的回击，保卫国家的安全。正是因为如此，我们就能够在平时适当地减少现役军队的人数，节省出人力财力，集中于国家的社会主义工业化建设，而为国防现代化打下强固的技术基础和经济基础。由此可见，实行义务兵役制是我国在过渡时期的总任务中所必不可少的一项任务。
    实行义务兵役制，不仅是国家建设的迫切需要，也是我国人民的普遍要求。在中华人民共和国宪法公布以后，人民群众纷纷向国家机关写信，表示坚决拥护宪法第一百零三条的规定，要求迅速实行义务兵役制，要求给予广大青年合理地履行兵役义务、轮流担负保卫祖国的机会。一九五四年十一月国务院决定按义务兵役制原则在全国二十五个省和内蒙古自治区试行征集补充兵员，同时进行义务兵役制原则的宣传，受到了各地人民的热烈拥护。在试行征集兵员期间，许多青年妇女登台讲演，鼓励亲人报名应征，许多老年人因儿子被批准服兵役而到处夸耀，许多被批准服兵役的青年兴奋的几夜睡不好觉。父母送儿子、妻子送丈夫、未婚妻送未婚夫、兄弟争着报名的情形，只据河北、河南、山西三省的不完全统计就有八万起。因此，全国报名应征的人数达到一千零三万二千余人，而实征的人数只有八十三万多人；同时我们从一九五四年到现在的复员人数却已有一百五十七万多人。这些入伍的新兵，都有政治上的觉悟，普遍地认为服兵役是光荣的义务。一九五五年二月在兵役法修正草案公布以后，国防部在二月至五月间收到各地爱国青年要求参军的信有一万五千多封，其中百分之九十六点五是各工厂、学校和机关中的青年，有的人接连写过七、八次甚至十多次信，有的人在信里还附来了照片、体格检查表和爱人的保证书。因为北京、上海、天津一九五四年没有分配征集兵员的任务，这三个城市的青年的来信最多。请让我念一封天津市一位青年许清元给国防部的来信吧！这封信说：
    “我再一次地和你谈谈我的志愿。这是第十二次申请参军。
    我今年二十岁，是中国新民主主义青年团团员。现在我是天津市第六建筑工程公司的一个职员。
    我生在一个贫苦农民的家里，从小过着悲惨的生活，东跑西颠，打柴砍草。因我们那里是老解放区，也念了几年书。小学毕业后，因家中生活困难，就在家种地。一九五二年参加了工作。
    我从小就有一个志愿：将来长大了决心当一名国防军战士--空军驾驶员！
    在我的记忆里，还是在抗日战争的时期，我们村里发生过一次剧烈的战斗。有一位八路军叔叔，他是机枪班的机枪射手，住在我们的家里。我和他很熟悉，他很爱我，我也很尊敬他。虽说只有四五天的光景，但他那种温柔和蔼的态度，却使我永远也忘不了他。在战斗结束后，不幸的事情被我知道了：他壮烈地光荣地牺牲了，为了人类的解放事业献出了他的生命！和人民永别了。当时我站在他的尸体旁边掉了几滴永别的纪念的眼泪。我暗暗地发过誓：亲爱的叔叔！我将来一定当八路军，决心替你报仇！从那时起我当人民空军驾驶员的志愿就产生了，也就注定了。一直到现在，无论如何也没有打消我当空军驾驶员的念头。
    我决心当一名国防军战士去保卫祖国，我决心让插到台湾去的革命红旗附上我的一滴鲜血。
    我再一次的请求你批准我当你的一名战士，早到预备航空学校一天好一天。我有一个强壮的身体，有坚强的勇气，我一定能担当起保卫祖国的任务来。我愿把我的青春，把我的光和热，献给伟大的人民解放军。”
    这位青年的信件代表了全国广大人民和广大青年对兵役法的反应。我国有无数这样忠心报国的青年，这就是我国实行兵役法的最有力的保证，这就是巩固祖国国防的最有力的保证。
    中华人民共和国兵役法同我们国家的其他法律一样，是建立在人民群众的利益和觉悟的基础上的，它同帝国主义国家以及国民党反动统治时期的兵役法有本质的区别。帝国主义的国家政权，只代表少数资本家的利益，帝国主义国家的军队是用来镇压劳动人民和对外实行侵略的工具，因此帝国主义国家的兵役制度是同劳动人民的利益完全对立的。国民党反动统治时期的所谓兵役法也同样是反人民的工具，因此国民党实行的仍然是强迫抽丁和抓兵。我们的兵役法是我国人民为巩固自己的国防、保卫自己的利益而履行兵役义务的法律，所以我国人民就积极拥护这个法律，把服兵役保卫祖国当作是他们的光荣义务和神圣权利。
    我国人民正在以忘我的劳动为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。我们需要和平。我们从来就没有而且永远也不会有侵略别国的想法。我们不需要扩大军队，相反地，我们在实行义务兵役制的过程中，已经并且还要减少我们军队的数量，以便节省国家的人力财力来发展社会主义经济和改善人民的物质文化生活。从中华人民共和国成立到现在，我们已经从军队中复员了四百五十一万多人。我们热烈地支持苏联政府在一九五五年五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议。我们也完全支持苏联政府提出的最迟在一九五六年上半年召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器会议的建议。如果这个会议能够开成，并在苏联政府建议的基础上达成协议，中国政府愿意进一步裁减自己的军队。
    我国人民和政府，对于缓和国际紧张局势，消除战争威胁和保障世界和平，曾经作了而且在继续作着不懈的努力。但是我们一时一刻也不能忘记美国侵略集团还在千方百计地阻挠着我国人民解放自己的领土台湾，用新的大规模侵略战争的计划威胁着我们。战争叫嚣者们正在以原子武器威胁着全人类，企图借此来达到他们奴役全世界的目的。我们热爱和平，但是如果帝国主义硬要把战争灾害加到我国人民的头上，侵犯我们的国土和主权的时候，我们也绝不惧怕战争，我们绝不能牺牲我国的领土和主权来换取和平。也正是因为这样，我们就不能不坚决地迅速地实行义务兵役制，并且从各方面加强我国的国防，以便时刻地准备以足够的力量来保卫我国的独立和世界的和平。
    兵役法修正草案公布以后，各级人民委员会和人民团体都进行了热烈的讨论，讨论中除对草案关于兵役义务、平时征集年龄和服役期限、军士和兵的现役和预备役、军官的现役和预备役、现役军人与预备役军人的权利和义务、战时的征集、高级中学以上学校学生的军事训练等项规定，一致认为适当外，还提出了三千多条文字上和内容上的修改的建议。国务院根据这些建议对原草案内容和文字作了一些修改。例如：原草案共五十七条，现增加一条，共为五十八条；原草案第十五条第一句和第七条末款合并成为现草案的第八条；原草案中“妇女”二字一律改为“女性公民”；原草案第十三条、第十四条、第十五条、第十六条、第十七条、第十八条、第十九条、第二十条、第三十三条、第三十八条、第五十二条，都根据建议作了文字上或内容上的修改。我们认为根据这些建议修改之后，草案是更加完善了。
    各位代表：制定中华人民共和国兵役法并颁布施行，是我国军事制度上一项重大的改革，是关系我国安全和全国人民生活的一件大事，是我国人民保卫祖国、保卫和平、反对帝国主义侵略的共同愿望和坚强意志的进一步的表现。全国广大人民已经以实际行动表示了他们对于实行义务兵役制的支持。当然，这并不是说为了兵役法的贯彻实施，我们的宣传工作和组织工作就已经做得尽善尽美，不会再遇到任何误解和不了解，不会再遇到反革命分子的造谣破坏了。不，不是这样。由于义务兵役制在我国还是一个新的制度，我们在实行兵役法的初期，特别需要在人民群众中进行最广泛最详细的宣传，真正做到家喻户晓，并且对于反革命破坏分子提高警惕，及时地揭发和打击反革命分子的阴谋破坏活动。依靠全国广大人民的觉悟，依靠全国各级国家机关和人民团体的努力，我们坚决相信，中华人民共和国兵役法必将顺利实施，全国人民必将积极拥护和执行兵役法的各项规定，为建设强大的国防军，为巩固国防，为保卫我们伟大的祖国而坚决奋斗。
