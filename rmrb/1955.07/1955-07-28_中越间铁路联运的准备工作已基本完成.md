Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 26th. Preparations for railway joint transport between China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which will begin on August 2nd, have now been basically completed.

    Because the railway gauge of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is slightly narrower than the standard gauge of China's railways, trains traveling between the two countries must be transshipped at Pingxiang Station on the Xiang-Gui Railway. The Liuzhou Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of China has expanded Pingxiang Station. The necessary building construction, freight sheds, communications, and signaling equipment for joint transport at the station were completed four days ahead of schedule on July 16th. Track-type cranes, tarpaulins, and other freight handling tools have also been transported to the station successively.

    The Liuzhou Railway Bureau also selected a group of railway workers to study joint transport experience in the Northeast beforehand. Now these cadres have been appointed as stationmasters and cargo directors of the joint transport station, respectively. At the same time, the Liuzhou Railway Bureau International Joint Transport Section, the Pingxiang Transshipment Operation Office, and the Pingxiang Handover Office, which manage the joint transport, have also been officially established.

    中越间铁路联运的准备工作已基本完成
    新华社南宁二十六日电　我国和越南民主共和国之间将自八月二日起举办铁路联运，现在联运的各项准备工作已基本完成。
    由于越南民主共和国的铁路路轨比我国铁路的标准轨稍窄，所以来往两国间的列车都要在湘桂铁路的凭祥车站换装。我国铁道部柳州铁路管理局已经把凭祥车站扩大了。车站联运必需的房屋建筑、货棚、通讯、信号设备等，已在七月十六日提前四天完成。履带式起重机、棚布等运货的工具也先后运到车站。
    柳州铁路管理局事先还选送了一批铁路工作人员去东北学习联运经验。现在这批干部已分别担任联运站站长、货物主任等职务。同时管理联运的柳州铁路管理局国际联运科、凭祥换装作业所和凭祥交接所等联运专业机构也已正式成立。
