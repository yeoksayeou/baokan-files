　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on the 5th at the request of the US side.

　　At the meeting, the US representative repeated its completely upside-down and hypocritical propaganda, insisting that the Korean-Chinese side was "violating the armistice agreement" and "illegally transporting" war materials, etc. The US even mobilized unidentified personnel on their side to fabricate baseless "materials" for malicious and provocative abuse.

　　Li Xiangchao, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, revealed at the meeting that the purpose of the US side's clamor was to undermine the armistice agreement and abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to freely implement the plan currently being discussed in Washington by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group regarding the expansion of the puppet army. To find an excuse for this matter, the US side is creating chaos by fabricating lies.

　　Li Xiangchao sternly pointed out that the armistice agreement is the prerequisite for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It is not only supported by the Korean people, but also by peace-loving people around the world. The armistice agreement was formulated according to mutually agreed-upon opinions. Therefore, the US side cannot unilaterally abolish any provision of the armistice agreement, and the Korean-Chinese side will absolutely not tolerate such behavior.

　　Li Xiangchao warned the US side that if the US side disregards everything and takes unilateral action, then the US side must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences arising therefrom and will incur the curses and condemnations of people all over the world.

　　李相朝中将揭露美方破坏停战协定的阴谋
    并表示绝不容忍美方片面废除停战协定任何条款的行为
    新华社平壤七日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会应美方的要求于五日举行会议。
      美方代表在会议上重复了它的完全颠倒黑白的虚伪宣传，硬说朝中方面是“在违反停战协定”和
  “非法运进”作战物资等等。美方甚至动员他们方面身份不明的人员捏造毫无根据的“材料”来进行恶毒的挑衅性的谩骂。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会议上揭露了美方这种叫嚣的目的是想破坏停战协定，取消中立国监察委员会，以便可以放手实现美国和李承晚集团现正在华盛顿讨论的关于扩充伪军的计划。为了替这件事寻找借口，美方正在用捏造谎话的办法来引起混乱。
    李相朝中将严厉地指出：停战协定是和平解决朝鲜问题的前提，它不但得到朝鲜人民的支持，而且还得到全世界各国爱好和平人民的支持。停战协定是按照双方一致同意的意见制定的。因此，美方不能够片面地废除停战协定中的任何条款，朝中方面也绝不能够容忍这种行为。
    李相朝中将警告美方说，如果美方不顾一切，采取片面行动的话，那末美方将必须对由此而引起的严重后果负全部责任，并将招致全世界人民的咒骂和谴责。
