Taiyuan City Reduces Investment in Basic Construction

　　By mid-June, basic construction units in Taiyuan City had formulated preliminary plans to reduce construction investment, which will save the state over 12.9 million yuan. Among the 7.6 million yuan investment reductions in eighteen units, including factories, mines, and post and telecommunications bureaus, investment reductions achieved by lowering standards for non-productive buildings amounted to more than 5.77 million yuan. For example, the five dormitory buildings contracted by the No. 202 Work Zone reduced the cost per square meter from the original 98 yuan to 74 yuan, and then re-examined the new standards, modifying the construction cost inside the dormitories. The four dormitories nearing completion originally planned to use magnesite flooring, but this was changed to concrete flooring. The "Kesaiyin" used for wall painting was replaced with whitewash, further reducing the cost of these four dormitories from 74 yuan per square meter to 66.53 yuan. For another dormitory that had not yet started construction, efforts were made to reduce the cost from 74 yuan to 60 yuan without changing the original structure, and the originally designed basement was canceled. In total, the investment reduced from the approval of new standards for these five buildings alone amounted to 200,000 yuan. In addition, various government agencies and schools in Taiyuan City are actively seeking ways to reduce unnecessary construction projects and lower costs. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party changed a planned four-story office building to a wood and earth structure single story building, which can save the state 245,000 yuan in investment.

　  太原市缩减基本建设投资
    太原市各基本建设单位已在六月中旬分别拟定缩减建设投资的初步计划，共计可为国家节省资金一千二百九十多万元。在厂矿和邮电局等十八个单位缩减的七百六十多万元投资中，降低非生产性建筑标准缩减的投资达五百七十七万多元。比如二○二工区承包的五幢宿舍大楼工程，把原每平方公尺造价九十八元降低到七十四元以后，又重新审定了新的标准，修改了宿舍内部的建筑造价。四幢快要完工的宿舍原计划采用的菱苦土地面，已改为混凝土地面；把刷墙用的“可赛银”改为大白灰等，使这四幢宿舍的造价由每平方公尺七十四元再降低到六十六元五角三分。另一幢未开工的宿舍，在不改变原结构的基础上，已设法将造价由七十四元降低到六十元，并取消原设计的地下室。总计这五幢楼房单从审定新标准缩减的投资即达二十万元。此外，太原市各机关学校也积极设法削减不必要的工程项目和降低造价，如中共山西省委把原计划修筑的一幢四层办公楼，改为土木结构的平房，可为国家节省投资二十四万五千元。（本报驻太原记者）
