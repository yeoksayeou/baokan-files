    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Soviet Union's Potato Production Ranks First in the World
    The Soviet Union's current potato production ranks first in the world, with potatoes planted in Soviet fields accounting for 33 percent of the world's total. This is the result of Soviet farmers' efforts to implement the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in September 1953 on further and rapidly increasing agricultural production.
    In the past two years, the production technology and mechanization of potato cultivation in the Soviet Union have been greatly improved. The advanced square-cluster planting method has been widely promoted in potato production. In 1954, 87 percent of the total sown area of potatoes was planted using this advanced method. This year, almost all potatoes are planted using this method. Planting with the square-cluster method not only increases the yield per unit area of potatoes, but more importantly, it allows for the extensive mechanization of planting, cultivation, harvesting, and other tasks. This year, the level of mechanization of potato production will reach 80 percent. There will be 45,000 combine harvesters alone used for harvesting potatoes, which is almost three times that of last year.
    Streamlining of Institutions in Soviet Factories
    The Party organization of the Tashkent Agricultural Machinery Factory in the Soviet Union actively led the work of improving production management institutions and reducing management expenses, achieving results.
    In May of this year, when the factory discussed the call from the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers, Communist Party members in the factory put forward dozens of suggestions at the Party meeting on reducing staffing and improving management institutions. The workshop committees of the trade union also held special meetings to study this issue. At the initiative of the Party committee, all these materials were summarized and submitted to the factory's management department.
    The factory's administrative leadership accepted and implemented the Party organization's suggestions, appropriately increasing the workload of staff members in the management institutions. Overlapping institutions were abolished, and the calculation of wages, materials, etc., which was previously scattered across various workshops, was concentrated in the factory's machine accounting office, where the workload was not excessive. The previous sixteen workshops were merged into ten workshops. This greatly reduced the number of employees in these departments. The factory also promoted methods such as simplifying reports and combining responsibilities in the administrative management departments, thereby reducing the number of employees in some departments by 25 to 30 percent. Dozens of people have now been transferred to production departments. Mergers are also underway in administrative management departments. It is estimated that the original twenty-five sections will be reduced to no more than fifteen after the mergers.
    Korea Announces Production Bulletin for the First Half of the Year
    The Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced on the 25th the bulletin on the implementation of the Three-Year Plan (1954-1956) for the Restoration and Development of the National Economy in the first half of this year.
    The bulletin shows that in the first half of this year, the total industrial output value completed 101 percent of the state plan, an increase of 70 percent compared to the first half of last year. The output of many major industrial products, such as electricity, coal, steel, chemical fertilizers, cement, and cotton textiles, has increased significantly. New types of lathes, DC generators, pig iron, and other industrial products that Korea did not produce in the past or that were suspended during the war began to be produced in the first half of this year.
    In agriculture, the total sown area of spring crops this year increased by 9,500 chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo) compared to last year. By the end of June this year, agricultural production cooperatives had grown to more than 11,000, with 44 percent of all peasant households participating in the cooperatives, and the cultivated area of the cooperatives accounting for 42 percent of the total cultivated area.
    In addition, railway, automobile, and inland waterway transportation all exceeded the semi-annual plan.
    The total investment in state capital construction in the first half of this year increased by 30 percent compared to the same period last year.
    Many important industrial production facilities have been restored and expanded and put into production.
    In commerce, the retail commodity circulation plan of state-owned and cooperative businesses completed 103 percent in the first half of last year, and the commodity circulation volume increased by 58 percent compared to the same period last year. The total value of foreign trade was 2.7 times that of the first half of last year.
    The bulletin also described the development of education and cultural undertakings in Korea in the first half of this year.
    The bulletin mentioned the huge assistance given to Korea by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries, and pointed out that this powerfully helped the restoration and development of the Korean people's economy.
    Romania Announces Production Bulletin for the Second Quarter of the Year
    The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic published a bulletin on the implementation of the national economic plan for the second quarter of 1955.
    The bulletin stated that the total output plan of socialist industry in the second quarter of this year was completed by 109 percent. Compared with the same period in 1954, the total industrial output in the second quarter of 1955 increased by 11.9 percent, and the labor productivity of industry increased by 13.8 percent.
    The railway freight transport plan for the second quarter was completed by 108 percent.
    In agriculture, the sown area in 1955 increased by 160,000 hectares compared to the sown area in 1954. In the second quarter of this year, agriculture also added 1,625 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor) and a large number of tractor-drawn plows, seeders, harvester-binders, threshers, and other agricultural machinery.
    As of the end of the first half of this year, the number of collective farms and joint farming societies has exceeded 5,500, including nearly 360,000 peasant households and owning nearly 1.3 million hectares of land. Laboring peasants have received assistance worth more than 70 million lei from the state through loans.
    In terms of cultural welfare, many new schools, cultural palaces, nurseries, and other institutions have been established in the first half of this year. In the first half of this year, the residential area completed for the use of working people was almost two and a half times that of the first half of 1954. The construction speed has been greatly increased due to the production of prefabricated components increasing to more than twice that of the first half of 1954.
    Democratic Germany Expands the Cottbus Lignite Coal Mine
    According to the German News Agency, the Minister of Heavy Industry of the German Democratic Republic, Selbmann, announced the expansion plan for the Cottbus Lignite Coal Mine on the 28th. The plan stipulates that by 1960, this coal mine will be built into the largest coal mine in Europe. It is estimated that the coal reserves of this coal mine are over 30 billion tons. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan of the German Democratic Republic (1960), the annual coal production of this mine will increase from 61 million tons in the First Five-Year Plan to 107 million tons. The plan also stipulates the opening of four new open-pit mines and the construction of a larger coking plant than the existing Lauchhammer coking plant, which is the world's first factory capable of refining lignite into coking coal. The plan also stipulates the construction of a city for 12,000 workers and their families.
    Bulgaria Mechanizes Grain Storage Work
    Bulgaria's grain management departments are making various preparations for the acquisition of new grain. State grain warehouses in various places have been repaired and disinfected, and warehouses in major grain-producing areas are also equipped with electric hygrometers.
    In order to avoid congestion and stagnation of trucks in grain transportation, the operation process of grain purchasing stations in various places will be widely mechanized. The machines used will include elevators, automatic feeding devices, and aerial conveyors. Dust removal devices will be installed in many places to eliminate dust mixed into the grain.
    In the wheat-producing areas—Dobruja and along the Danube—automatic feeding devices have been used to load grain from the grain collection yard onto transport vehicles, from here through the grain cleaning device, and then transported to the granary by the transport vehicle. The mechanization of the storage work in each granary alone can save about 50,000 leva (Bulgarian currency).
    Albania Trains Agricultural Specialists
    Before liberation, Albania had only one agricultural school and an agricultural department attached to the Tirana Secondary Technical School. Now, Albania has agricultural colleges, agricultural secondary technical schools, agricultural machinery operator training classes, schools for team leaders of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, and leadership cadre schools for agricultural production cooperatives to train agricultural talents.
    In the past two years, they have trained 1,900 agricultural specialists for the country. This year, more than 400 tractor drivers, combine harvester operators, and tractor team leaders have entered the agricultural machinery operator training classes in Shkodër and Kavajë. Recently, 600 young livestock breeders, veterinarians, and forestry experts will be sent to the countryside. In this academic year, many agronomists and livestock breeders will graduate from agricultural colleges. Eighty Albanian future veterinarians, field workers, horticulturists, and other agricultural specialists are currently studying in universities in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联的马铃薯产量占世界第一位
    苏联目前的马铃薯产量已占世界第一位，在苏联田野上栽种的马铃薯占全世界的百分之三十三。这是苏联农民努力贯彻苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全会作出关于进一步迅速提高农业生产的决议的结果。
    两年来，苏联种植马铃薯的生产技术和机械化程度大大提高了。先进的正方穴播法在马铃薯生产中得到广泛的推广。在一九五四年，占总播种面积的百分之八十七的马铃薯是用这种先进方法播种的，今年，几乎全部马铃薯都用这种方法播种。用正方穴播法播种不但可以提高马铃薯的单位面积产量，更重要的是使它的播种、中耕、收获和其他工作广泛机械化。今年，马铃薯的机械化水平将达百分之八十，单是用来收获马铃薯的联合机就将有四万五千台，这几乎等于去年的三倍。
    苏联工厂的精简机构工作
    苏联塔什干农业机器工厂的党组织积极领导改进生产管理机构，削减管理费用的工作，获得了成绩。
    今年五月间，工厂讨论全苏工业工作人员会议的号召书时，工厂里的共产党员就在党的会议上提出了几十条关于缩减编制，改进管理机构的建议。工会的车间委员会也专门开会研究了这个问题。根据党的委员会的倡议，这些材料都全部总结起来，并交给工厂的管理部门。
    工厂的行政领导接受并执行党组织的建议，适当地增加了管理机构工作人员劳动日的工作量。取消了重叠机构，把过去分散在各个车间的工资、材料等的计算工作都集中到了工作量不过多的工厂机器核算处，并且将过去的十六个车间合并成了十个车间。这样就大大减少了这些部门的职员人数。工厂在行政管理部门中，也推行了简化表报和兼管工作等办法，因而使一些部门的员额削减了百分之二十五到三十。现在已有几十人转到生产部门工作。行政管理部门中也在进行合并工作。估计原有的二十五个科室经过合并以后，将不超过十五个。
    朝鲜发表今年上半年生产公报
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局二十五日发表了人民经济恢复发展三年计划（一九五四——一九五六年）在今年上半年执行情况的公报。
    公报表明，在今年上半年，工业总产值完成了国家计划的百分之一百零一，比去年上半年增加了百分之七十。电力、煤、钢、化学肥料、水泥和棉织品等许多主要工业品的产量都有显著增加。新型车床、直流发电机、生铁等朝鲜过去不生产或在战时中止生产的工业品，在今年上半年开始生产了。
    在农业方面，今年春播作物的总播种面积比去年增加了九千五百町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。到今年六月底为止，农业生产合作社已发展到一万一千多个，全部农户的百分之四十四参加了合作社，合作社的耕地面积占全部耕地面积的百分之四十二。
    此外，铁道、汽车和内河航运也都超额完成半年计划。
    今年上半年国家基本建设的总投资额比去年同期增加了百分之三十。
    许多重要工业生产设备已恢复和扩建完成并且投入了生产。
    在商业方面，去年上半年国营和合作社营商业的零售商品流通计划完成了百分之一百零三，商品流通额比去年同时期增加了百分之五十八。对外贸易总额等于去年上半年的二点七倍。
    公报也叙述了今年上半年朝鲜教育文化事业发展的情况。
    公报谈到了苏联、中华人民共和国和其他兄弟国家给予朝鲜的巨额援助，并且指出，这有力地帮助了朝鲜人民经济的恢复和发展。
    罗马尼亚发表今年第二季生产公报
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议中央统计局发表了一九五五年第二季度国民经济计划执行情况的公报。
    公报说，今年第二季度社会主义工业的总产量计划完成了百分之一百零九。同一九五四年同时期比较，一九五五年第二季度的工业总产量增加了百分之十一点九，工业的劳动生产率提高了百分之十三点八。
    第二季度的铁路货运计划完成了百分之一百零八。
    在农业方面，一九五五年的播种面积比一九五四年的播种面积增加了十六万公顷。在今年第二季度中，农业又增加了一千六百二十五台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和大量的拖拉机曳引犁、播种机、收割—捆禾机、打谷机及其他农业机器。
    截至今年上半年终了时为止，集体农庄和共耕社的数目已超过了五千五百个，它们包括将近三十六万个农户和拥有将近一百三十万公顷的土地。劳动农民通过贷款从国家方面取得了价值七千多万列伊的援助。
    在文化福利方面，今年上半年设立了许多新的学校、文化宫、托儿所等机构。今年上半年，已经建成的供劳动人民利用的居住面积几乎达到一九五四年上半年的二倍半。由于今年上半年装配式构件的生产量增加到一九五四年上半年的两倍以上，建筑速度大大提高了。
    民主德国扩建科特布斯褐煤煤矿
    据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国重工业部部长赛尔布曼在二十八日宣布了科特布斯褐煤煤矿的扩建计划。计划规定，到一九六零年要把这个煤矿建成为欧洲最大的一个煤矿。据估计，这个煤矿的煤储量在三百亿吨以上。到德意志民主共和国第二个五年计划结束时（一九六零年），这个矿每年的产煤量就要从第一个五年计划的六千一百万吨增加到一亿零七百万吨。计划还规定要新开四个露天矿，新建一个比这里原有的劳赫汉麦尔炼焦厂更大的炼焦厂，劳赫汉麦尔炼焦厂是世界上第一个能把褐煤炼成焦煤的工厂。计划同时规定要为一万二千个工人和他们的家属建造一个城市。
    保加利亚收藏粮食工作机械化
    保加利亚的粮食管理部门正在为收购新粮进行各种准备工作。各地的国家粮食仓库已经进行了修理和消毒，主要谷物区的仓库还装备了电动湿度计。
    为了避免在运粮中卡车发生拥挤和停歇现象，各地粮食收购站的操作过程都将广泛地实行机械化。使用的机器将有升运器、自动供应装置和空中输送机等。在许多地方将装置吸尘装置，以消除混入谷物中的尘土。
    在小麦产区——多布鲁查和沿多瑙河一带已利用自动供应装置，把谷物从收谷场装上运输机，从这里经过清谷装置，再由运输机送往谷仓。单是由于每个谷仓收藏工作实行机械化，就约可节省五万列弗（保币名）。
    阿尔巴尼亚培养农业专门人才
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚只有一个农业学校和附设在地拉那中等技术学校内的一个农业科。现在，阿尔巴尼亚已经有农业学院、农业中等技术学校、农业机械操使者训练班、国营农场和农业生产合作社工作队队长学校以及农业生产合作社领导干部学校等培养农业人才的机关。
    最近两年来，它们已经为国家培养了一千九百名农业专门人才。今年，已经有四百多名拖拉机手、联合收割机手和拖拉机工作队队长进入了斯库台和卡伐雅的农业机械操使者训练班。最近，将有六百名青年牲畜饲养家、兽医和林业专家被派到农村去。在本学年，还将有许多农学家和牲畜饲养家从农业学院毕业。有八十名阿尔巴尼亚未来的兽医、田间工作者、园艺家和其他农业专家现在正在苏联和各人民民主国家的高等学校里学习。
