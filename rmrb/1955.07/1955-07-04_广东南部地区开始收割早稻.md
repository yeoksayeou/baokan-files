　　Early Rice Harvest Begins in Southern Guangdong

　　In Guangdong Province, over 4.6 million mu of early rice have begun to be harvested in the Chao-Shan Plain, the Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and parts of the Pearl River Delta. This spring, in the struggle against drought, Chenghai, Chao'an, Puning and other counties, which blockaded the Han River to divert water for irrigation, have all overfulfilled their production plans. According to statistics from 155 townships in Chao'an County, production increased by more than 9 percent. The average yield per mu in Chenghai County reached 400 jin, with the highest reaching 810 jin. Changgan and Lingao counties in the Hainan Island area increased production by about 10 to 25 percent. In Qiongshan County, twelve agricultural production cooperatives have seen an increase of 400 to 600 jin of grain income per household due to the bumper harvest of early rice. Currently, there are still more than 25 million mu of rice in the province that have headed and are being irrigated, and harvesting will begin in mid-July. (Li Shaoqiu)

　　广东南部地区开始收割早稻
    广东省的潮汕平原，雷州半岛、海南岛和珠江三角洲部分地区，已有四百六十多万亩早稻开始收割。今春在抗旱斗争中，封锁韩江引水灌溉的澄海、潮安、普宁等县，都超额完成生产计划。潮安县据一百五十五个乡统计，增产百分之九以上。澄海全县每亩平均产量达到四百斤，最高的八百一十斤。海南岛地区的昌感、临高两县约增产一成到两成半。琼山县有十二个农业生产合作社因早稻丰收，每户可增加四百至六百斤谷子的收入。现在全省还有二千五百多万亩水稻已经抽穗灌浆，将在七月中旬开始收割。　（李少球）
