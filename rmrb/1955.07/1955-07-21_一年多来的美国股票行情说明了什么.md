What the US Stock Market over the Past Year Shows
Qin Benli

The US stock market has fluctuated greatly over the past year or so, experiencing the highest peak in US history and also falling to the lowest level since the outbreak of the Korean War. What does this dramatic fluctuation in the US stock market indicate?

Some in the American business community describe the rise in stock prices over the past year as a reflection of American economic prosperity. This assessment contradicts the actual situation. In 1954 alone, the stock prices of major companies on the New York Stock Exchange rose by about 40%; in December 1954, the average price of stocks of 30 major US industrial companies was more than 60% higher than in 1953. However, US industrial production in 1954 not only did not increase compared to 1953, but actually declined. The US industrial production index fell from 137 in July 1953 (1947-1949 = 100, same below) to 123 in March 1954, a decrease of 9%. From March to August 1954, it remained roughly at this low level. Although it began to rise slowly after September 1954, it only rose to 130 by December, not yet recovering to the level of July 1953. The average level of industrial production for the entire year of 1954 was lower than that of 1953. This shows that the rise in US stock prices was not a reflection of increased production.

As for the rise in industrial production that began in September 1954, its foundation was narrow and extremely unstable. The main factor contributing to the increase in industrial production during this period was the increase in the automobile industry. However, the increase in automobile production was not due to normal consumer demand, but due to: in order to cope with possible strikes, major automobile companies brought forward their spring production plans; in addition, major automobile companies such as General Motors and Ford decided to expand the production of new models in order to compete for market share. This led to an unusually high increase in output by major automobile companies last winter. Another factor that increased industrial production was the increase in construction contracts, which was largely due to government stimulus measures such as easing loan conditions. The increased demand for steel from these two sectors was the main factor driving the increase in steel industry production. It can be seen that this increase was caused by artificial stimulus and was not a normal phenomenon. Even as this "rise" occurred, some phenomena of economic crisis continued to develop. These included increased unemployment, large-scale bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises, declining farmers' incomes, reduced investment in factories and equipment, and the increasing surplus of capital. All of this shows that the "rise" in the US economy promoted by the US government and the bourgeois press does not have a solid foundation.

The so-called "prosperity" of the stock market is purely speculative in nature.

On the one hand, industrial investment has decreased. US companies' investment in new plants and equipment in 1954 totaled $26.7 billion, a decrease of 6% from the $28.4 billion in 1953. Among them, the sectors with particularly large reductions in investment were ferrous metallurgy and machinery manufacturing. The reduction in investment exceeded 40%. The severe reduction in investment in the production of means of production reflects the lack of confidence among American business owners in the prospects for production.

On the other hand, there is an increase in floating capital in the market. In the absence of certainty about the prospects for production, the owners of floating capital are increasingly flocking to speculation in stocks. The US government's use of loose monetary policy to stimulate the economy has resulted in an increase in this capital engaged in speculation. Many people who have obtained low-interest credit loans are not investing the loans in production, but are flocking to the stock market in large numbers. A US government survey of the stock market this spring showed that loans obtained from banks for stock and securities speculation amounted to $7.2 billion. An Associated Press reporter analyzed in November last year that "credit conditions may have been eased to such an extent in the past year... that speculators are now able to borrow money to buy and sell on the stock market, and the low interest rates make borrowing for this purpose unusually attractive. This provides the possibility for a speculative rise in stocks."

The US government eliminated the excess profits tax levied on monopoly companies in January 1954. This measure greatly protected the interests of monopoly capital in the context of economic deterioration. As a result, the total number of bankruptcies of small companies in 1954 reached 11,000, an increase of 25% over 1953, while the net income and dividends of large companies remained at a high level. The total profits of US companies in 1954 decreased by nearly 3% compared to 1953, but the profits of 1,131 major manufacturing companies increased by 5%. The stocks of monopoly enterprises became objects of speculation on the exchange, further encouraging stock speculation.

Precisely because the so-called "prosperity" of the stock market is caused by feverish speculation, the stock exchange is in a nervous and tense atmosphere. As long as there is a slight hint of unfavorable news for stock speculation, stock prices will plummet. For example, on January 4, 1955, the US government announced an increase in the margin required to purchase stocks. On January 5th and 6th, the stock market experienced a large-scale drop. The magnitude of this decline greatly exceeded the usual fluctuations of the stock exchange. As some journalists pointed out at the time, increasing the margin only prompted the decline in stock prices to a certain extent; if the US economic situation were truly stable and if the rise in stock prices had a solid foundation, this serious consequence would not have occurred.

It goes without saying that the dramatic fluctuations in the US stock market in the past year are purely speculative. However, it would be incomplete not to mention the relationship between the US stock market and the international situation. Whenever the international situation becomes tense, speculators on the stock exchange buy large quantities of stocks of large monopoly companies related to military production, triggering a rise in prices; conversely, the easing of the international situation is also reflected in the decline in US stock prices.

Here are a few key examples. After the US congressional elections ended on November 2, 1954, those who advocated a significant increase in military spending gained the upper hand. The next day, US industrial stocks, especially those related to the military, experienced the most violent surge in fifteen years. In early December 1954, the signing of the US-Chiang treaty, which foreshadowed the intensification of US aggression against the Far East, occurred; in the same month, the average price of stocks of 30 major US industrial companies rose to the highest peak in US stock prices in 25 years. Starting on January 24, 1955, as President Eisenhower asked Congress to grant him full power to carry out armed intervention in China, stock prices rose sharply, especially the stocks of companies that could greatly benefit from increased military spending. For example, the stock of General Dynamics, which manufactures nuclear submarines and airplanes, rose by $5.5 per share, creating a new high in the rate of increase. Lockheed Aircraft's stock rose by $2.75, Republic Aviation's stock rose by $1.75, and the stocks of other companies related to the arms industry also rose significantly. On March 26, 1955, after former US Navy Operations Director Carney spread the news that the situation in the Taiwan area was urgent, US stock prices soared again. On April 15, the average price of stocks of 30 major US industrial companies reached $425.45, the highest peak in US history.

The most recent sharp fluctuation best illustrates the issue. In the first half of May this year, just as news of the agreement on the Austrian State Treaty and the impending summit meeting of the four major powers was being reported one after another, New York stock prices continued to fall. On May 14, the four foreign ministers reached a general agreement on the summit meeting; on May 15, the Austrian State Treaty was signed; and on May 16, the New York stock market experienced another of the most violent declines of the year. The stocks that fell the most in this decline were those of companies that produce military aircraft, such as Boeing and Douglas. These stocks fell by 35% compared to the highest prices they had reached this year. An Associated Press reporter reported at the time that the reason for the sharp drop was that Wall Street investors and businessmen were worried that these international events "were the beginning of the end of the Cold War." But in the second half of May, prominent American generals successively delivered speeches and talks, using fabricated so-called "Soviet threats" to scare the American people. It was in this burst of war rhetoric that the US House of Representatives approved the bill to allocate a huge amount of $31.488 billion to the Department of Defense in the 1955-1956 fiscal year (last year's appropriation was $28.8 billion). On May 26, the US Air Force Secretary announced that the production speed of B-52 aircraft would be increased to 35% above the current level. This clamor and these measures were immediately reflected in the stock market. On May 27, the stock price of Boeing Aircraft, which was contracted to manufacture B-52 aircraft, rose steadily after the opening, and the stocks of other aircraft companies also followed suit, and the entire stock market generally rose.

From this, people can clearly see the close relationship between the US monopoly capital groups, especially the stock prices of large companies related to military production, and the international tense situation. A tense international situation makes it easier for the US government to intensify its arms expansion and war preparations. And intensifying arms expansion and war preparations, for American monopoly capital, means booming business and huge profits. A recent report issued by the US Department of Defense illustrates how close the relationship between military orders and monopoly capital, especially large monopoly capital, is. The report said that during the half-year from July 1, 1954, to December 31, 1954, the US government issued a total of $16.3372 billion in military orders. Nineteen large monopoly companies obtained $8.2 billion in orders from this, accounting for half of the total. The five companies that received the most orders were all aircraft companies, totaling $4.5191 billion. The other companies among the above-mentioned nineteen large companies are also related to the manufacture of aviation equipment. The profits made by these monopoly companies greatly exceed the profits of other industrial companies. The Wall Street Journal reported on March 13 this year that the net profit of sixteen aircraft companies in 1954 increased by 77% compared to 1953, while the average profit of 726 companies in other industries only increased by 3.4%. The New York Stock Exchange's official newspaper reported that the dividends paid by the aircraft company group in 1954 increased by 63.3% compared to 1953, which was the highest amount of dividends obtained by all industrial companies in 1954. It is precisely because of this that, according to materials published by Standard & Poor's, the stock price of aircraft companies in 1954 rose by nearly 131%, which is higher than that of any other industrial company.

Currently, military production accounts for about 20% to 25% of the total industrial production in the United States. American monopoly capital is increasingly relying on government military orders and war preparation expenditures to maintain corporate activities and ensure huge profits. Against this background, people can understand that the drastic fluctuations in the US stock market over the past year or so are a reflection of the extreme corruption of the militarized economy of American capitalism. This clearly shows why the prospect of easing the current international situation is so unpalatable to American monopolists and why they are so deeply fearful of peace. On the very day that the summit meeting of the four heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France was held, US stock prices generally fell, and the stocks of the aircraft and steel industries, which are closely related to military production, fell the most. The Associated Press quoted comments from New York market "observers" calling it a case of "peace jitters." At the same time, American monopolists do not conceal their hope that any negotiations on easing international tensions will not produce decisive results. This should arouse deep attention and vigilance among peace-loving people.

    一年多来的美国股票行情说明了什么
    钦本立
    美国股票行情这一年多来的波动很大，出现过美国有史以来的最高峰，也跌到过朝鲜战争爆发以来最低的水平。美国股票行情这种剧烈的波动说明了什么呢？
    有些美国企业界人士把股票行情在这一年多中间上升的现象说成是美国经济繁荣的反映。这种估计是和实际情况相抵触的。一九五四年一年内，纽约交易所各大公司的股票行情上涨了百分之四十左右；一九五四年十二月，美国三十个主要工业公司股票的平均行情更比一九五三年高出百分之六十。但是，一九五四年的美国工业生产不仅没有比一九五三年增加，相反的是下降了。美国工业生产指数自一九五三年七月的一三七（一九四七—一九四九年为一○○，下同）下降到一九五四年三月的一二三，即下降百分之九。从一九五四年三月到八月，一直大致维持在这个低水平。一九五四年九月以后虽开始缓慢上升，但到十二月也只上升到一三○，还没有恢复到一九五三年七月的水平。一九五四年工业生产全年平均水平比一九五三年低。这就说明，美国股票行情上升不是生产增加的反映。
    就一九五四年九月开始的工业生产上升来说，它的基础也是狭窄和极不稳固的。这个时期工业生产增加的主要因素是由于汽车工业的增加。但汽车工业生产的增加不是由于正常的消费需要，而是由于：为着应付可能的罢工，各大汽车公司都把今年春季的生产计划提前实施；再加上通用、福特等主要汽车公司为了争夺市场，都决定了扩大新型汽车的生产计划。这就使得各大汽车公司在去年冬季都异乎寻常地提高了产量。另一个使工业生产增加的因素是建筑合同的增加，而这在很大程度上是由于政府放宽贷款条件等刺激的结果。这两个部门对钢铁需要量的增大，是促使钢铁工业生产增加的主要因素。由此可见，这种增加是人为的刺激造成的，它不是正常的现象。就在这种“上升”的同时，经济危机的一些现象也在继续发展。那就是失业增加，中小企业大批破产，农民收入下降，工厂和装备的投资减少，以及资本的日益过剩等等。所有这一切说明：美国官方和资产阶级报刊所宣扬的美国经济“上升”并没有稳固的基础。
    所谓股票市场的“繁荣”是属于纯粹投机性质的。
    一方面，工业投资减少了。美国公司一九五四年对新企业和设备的投资共为二百六十七亿美元，比一九五三年二百八十四亿美元减少百分之六。其中投资额减少程度特别大的部门有黑色冶金业、机器制造业等。投资额减少在百分之四十以上。对于生产生产资料部门投资的严重的缩减，反映了美国企业主对于生产前途的缺乏信心。
    另一方面，市场上游资增多。在生产前途没有把握的情况下，游资的拥有者日益群趋于股票的投机。美国政府用放松银根的办法来刺激经济，结果是增加了这种从事投机的资本。许多得到低息信用贷款的人并不把贷款投入生产方面，却大量地涌入股票市场。今年春季美国政府对股票市场的一次调查说明，为了从事股票和证券投机而向银行贷得的款项达七十二亿美元。美联社记者在去年十一月就曾作过这样的分析：“信贷条件可能已经比过去一年放宽到这样的程度……投机者现在能够为了进行股票市场买卖而借款，而利息之低足以使为此目的而进行的借款出乎寻常地具有吸引力。这样就为股票的投机性上升提供了可能。”
    美国政府在一九五四年一月取消了对垄断公司征收的过分利得税。这个措施在经济恶化的情况下大大地维护了垄断资本的利益。因此，一九五四年小公司破产户总数达一万一千，比一九五三年增加百分之二十五，而大公司的纯收入和红利仍维持在一个高的水平。一九五四年美国各公司的总利润比一九五三年下降了近百分之三，但一千一百三十一个主要制造业公司的利润却上升了百分之五。垄断企业的股票成为交易所投机的对象，益加鼓励了股票投机。
    正是因为股票市场的所谓“繁荣”是由于狂热的投机所造成，所以股票交易所处于神经质的紧张的气氛中。只要稍有不利于股票投机的风声，股票行情就会狂跌。例如，一九五五年一月四日，美国政府宣布提高购买股票必须付出的保证金。一月五日、六日股票市场就发生了大规模的跌风。这次下跌的幅度大大地超过了股票交易所通常的波动。正像当时有些记者所指出，增加保证金只是在一定程度上促使股票行情下降，如果美国经济情况真正稳定的话，如果股票行市的上升有着坚实的基础的话，就不会产生这种严重的后果的。
    近一年来美国股票行情的剧烈波动是属于纯粹的投机性是用不着再多说的。但是，如果不提到美国股票市场和国际局势的关系那是不全面的。每当国际局势趋于紧张的时候，股票交易所的投机者就大量买进与军事生产有关的大垄断公司的股票而掀起涨风；相反，国际局势的趋于缓和从美国股票行情下跌中也得到反映。
    这里举出几个主要的例子来看。一九五四年十一月二日美国国会选举结束，主张大大增加军备的人占了优势。第二天，美国工业，特别是和军事有关的工业股票就出现了十五年以来最猛烈的涨风。一九五四年十二月初，预示着美国对远东侵略加紧的美蒋条约签订，同月，美国三十个主要工业公司股票的平均价格就上升到二十五年以来美国股票价格的最高峰。一九五五年一月二十四日起，由于艾森豪威尔总统要国会赋予他对中国进行武装干涉的全权，股票的价格就纷纷上涨，特别是能够从军费的增加中得到很大好处的公司的股票上涨最烈。例如，制造原子潜水艇和飞机的通用动力公司股票每股上涨了五点五美元，创造了上涨幅度的新高峰。洛克希德飞机公司股票上涨了二点七五美元，共和飞机公司股票上涨了一点七五美元，其他和军火工业有关的公司股票也都显著上涨。一九五五年三月二十六日美国前海军作战部长卞湼散布台湾地区形势紧急的消息以后，美国股票行情又扶摇直上。四月十五日，美国三十个主要工业公司股票平均价格达到四二五点四五美元，为美国有史以来的最高峰。
    最近的一次激烈的波动，是最能说明问题的。今年五月上半月，正当奥地利国家条约获得协议、酝酿举行四大国政府首脑会议的消息接连传出的时候，纽约股票行情就一直下跌。五月十四日，四国外长就政府首脑会议问题达成一般协议，十五日，奥地利国家条约签字，十六日，纽约股票市场就发生了今年以来又一次最猛烈的跌风。在这次跌风中，跌得最厉害的是波音、道格拉斯等出产军用飞机的公司股票。这些股票比今年所曾达到的最高价下跌了百分之三十五。美联社记者当时报道说，这次大跌价的原因是，华尔街的投资家和商人担心这些国际事件“到底是不是冷战结束的开始”。但到五月下半月后，美国显要的将军们接连地发表演说和谈话，用捏造的所谓“苏联威胁”来恐吓美国人民，就在这一阵战争叫嚷声中，美国众议院批准了在一九五五—一九五六财政年度拨给国防部三百一十四亿八千八百万美元庞大经费的法案（去年的拨款是二百八十八亿美元）。五月二十六日美空军部长宣布把B五十二型飞机的生产速度增加到超过目前水平百分之三十五。这种叫嚣和措施立刻在股票市场得到了反映。五月二十七日，承造B五十二型飞机订货的波音飞机公司股票价格开盘后就一直上升，其他飞机公司的股票也跟着上升，整个股票行情普遍叫高。
    从这里人们可以清楚地看到，美国的垄断资本集团，特别是和军事生产有关系的大公司的股票行市同国际紧张局势的密切关系。国际局势紧张便于美国政府加紧实行扩军备战。而加紧扩军备战，对于美国垄断资本来说，就意味着兴隆的生意和巨额利润。最近美国国防部发表的一个报告说明军事定货和垄断资本、特别是大垄断资本有着怎样密切的关系。这个报告说，从一九五四年七月到一九五四年十二月三十一日这半年内，美国政府发出的军事定单共达一百六十三亿三千七百二十万美元。十九家大垄断公司从中获得定货八十二亿美元，占总数的一半。其中得到定货最多的五家公司都是飞机公司，共获得四十五亿一千九百一十万美元。上述十九家大公司中的其他几家公司也都是同制造航空设备有关的。这些垄断公司所取得的利润，大大超过其他工业公司的利润。华尔街日报今年三月十三日报道，一九五四年十六个飞机公司的净利比一九五三年上升了百分之七七，而其他各种工业的七百二十六个公司的平均利润只上升百分之三点四。纽约股票交易所机关报报道，飞机公司集团在一九五四年所付出的红利比一九五三年增加百分之六三点三，这是所有工业公司中在一九五四年中所得红利的最高数额。正是因为如此，所以据史坦德—普尔公司发表的材料，一九五四年的飞机公司股票价格将近上涨到百分之一三一，比任何其他工业公司股票都要高。
    现在，在美国全部工业生产中，军事生产已占百分之二十至二十五左右。美国垄断资本愈来愈依靠政府的军事定货和备战开支来维持企业活动和保障巨额利润。在这个背景下面，人们可以了解到，美国股票市场近一年多来的剧烈波动是美国资本主义的军事化经济的极端腐朽性的一种反映。这清楚地说明，为什么当前国际局势趋于缓和的前景是那样不合于美国垄断资本家的胃口，为什么他们对和平是那样的深怀恐惧。就在苏美英法四国政府首脑会议召开的当天，美国股票价格普遍下跌，和军用生产有密切关系的飞机和钢铁工业股票跌得最多。美联社引用纽约市场“观察家”的评论，把这称为一场“和平吃惊病”。同时，美国垄断资本家并不掩饰他们的这种希望：关于缓和国际紧张局势的任何谈判，将不产生有决定意义的结果。这一点，应该引起爱好和平的人们深切的注意和警惕。
