	Cherish Every Inch of Cotton Yarn
	Yǔn Gōng
	In the past, in the second workshop of the Shenyang Cotton Textile Factory, wads of tangled thread and long yarn tails could be seen everywhere, trampled underfoot or wrapped around yarn tubes. Many workers regarded this waste as inevitable in the textile industry. Zhang Jun'gui, a weaving worker and Communist Party member, felt heartbroken when he saw this waste.
	The looms kept clicking, and as Zhang Jun'gui patrolled and operated five looms, he thought about how the Party had taught him: "We must cherish every inch of cotton yarn, and this is the direction of the struggle for the Communist Party members in the second workshop."
	One day in March, Zhang Jun'gui kept a close eye on the yarn spools that had been used up on his looms, each of which had some cotton yarn left on it. He also noticed that the yarn spools from other looms also had a lot of yarn left. He carefully studied this matter. Every day, he experimented with moving the first rubber lever back more than four inches before each "spool change." After several such experiments, each spool wove more than four inches of cloth than before. He happily told the workshop director about this and suggested that the leadership organize everyone to adopt this method. Soon, Zhang Jun'gui's operation method was promoted in the workshop. According to preliminary calculations, if all the weaving workers in the factory implemented this method, they could weave more than two thousand feet of twill fabric more per year.
	Zhang Jun'gui not only paid attention to saving cotton yarn at all times, but also often reminded the people around him to save. Once, he passed by the yarn-sorting process and saw that there were as many as five or six wads of sorted yarn tangled on the "roller" and "roller shaft," so he told Chai Guilan, the female worker in charge of the yarn-sorting machine, and Chai Guilan immediately adjusted the yarn-sorting machine. Zhang Jun'gui's family originally lived in the countryside, and he was very familiar with the cotton production situation, so he often said to his partners: "It is not easy for cotton farmers to tend cotton, how can we be worthy of our farmer brothers if we waste cotton casually!"
	At the second Party congress of the cotton textile factory, Zhang Jun'gui was commended.

    珍惜每一寸棉纱
    允恭
    从前，在沈阳棉织厂的二车间里，到处都可以看到一团团的乱线头和长纱尾巴被踏在地下或缠在线管上。许多工人把这种浪费看成纺织工业中不可避免的。织布工人、共产党员张均贵看到这些浪费现象很心痛。
    机台不断地响着咔哒咔哒的声音，张均贵一边巡回地操纵着五台织布机，一边想着党曾经这样教育过他：“必须珍贵地使用每一寸的棉纱，这就是二车间的共产党员斗争的方向。”
    三月里的一天，张均贵的眼睛不断地瞅着自己机台上用完了的一个个纱轴，每个纱轴上都剩下一些棉纱。他又注意看了看别的机台下来的纱轴也都剩下不少纱。他就仔细研究这件事。每天他都试验着在每次“了轴”之前，把头一个胶杆往后移动四寸多。这样试验几次以后，每一个轴就都比过去多织出四寸多的布。他高兴地把这件事告诉了车间主任，同时还建议领导上组织大家都采用这个办法。不久车间里就推广了张均贵的操作法。据初步计算，这个厂织布工人都实行这个方法，全年就能多织出两千多尺斜纹布。
    张均贵不仅自己时刻注意节约棉纱，同时也经常提醒他周围的人节约。有一次他路过格纱工序，看见“罗拉”“辊轴”上缠着足有五、六团子格纱，他就告诉了看格纱机的女工柴桂兰，柴桂兰立刻调整了格纱机。张均贵的家原来住在农村，他对棉花生产情况很熟悉，因此他常对伙伴们说：“棉农侍弄棉花可真不容易呀，咱们要随便糟蹋了棉花，怎能对得起农民兄弟呀！”
    在棉织厂的第二届党员大会上，张均贵受到了表扬。
