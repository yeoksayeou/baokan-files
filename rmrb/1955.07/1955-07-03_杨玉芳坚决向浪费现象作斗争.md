　　Yang Yufang resolutely fights against waste

　　On the afternoon of March 27, Yang Yufang, a dispatcher at the riveting and welding workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, saw three or four workers in the workshop busily cutting steel plates. He inquired and found out that they were cutting this batch of steel, planing it thin, and then manufacturing a batch of hanging weights (also called drop weights).

　　Yang Yufang returned to his office, took the blueprints, and after thinking about it, felt there was a problem: This kind of hanging weight is for rough work, wouldn't it be more economical to use castings? Why use 12 mm steel plates? Even if using steel plates, the total thickness of the hanging weight is 96 mm, and eight layers of 12 mm steel plates would suffice. Why plane off 4 mm from the 12 mm steel plates and then stack twelve layers together?

　　He took the blueprints and discussed it with the group leader, Liu Shide. Liu Shide also felt there was a problem, but the engineer and technicians had reviewed the blueprints, and the construction section had also approved them, so they had to do it this way. Yang Yufang then consulted with the construction worker, Fan Yonggui, who strongly supported his opinion. The two of them did detailed calculations, and then Fan Yonggui went to the design section. Unexpectedly, the design section's Liu Shouwei replied: "Let's just do it according to the original design!" Engineer Zhang even said impatiently: "Follow the regulations, construction must adhere to the rules and regulations."

　　Yang Yufang was determined to fight to save national wealth. That day, he went to the factory director, but the factory director was in a meeting and asked him to talk the next morning.

　　The next day, as soon as the work bell rang, Yang Yufang was already talking to Factory Director Wang. Factory Director Wang agreed with Lao Yang's spirit of research and supported the suggestion, immediately summoning Engineer Zhang to study it together. Factory Director Wang explained to Engineer Zhang that the suggestion of using castings to make hanging weights was correct, and pointed out that engineering and technical personnel should respect correct opinions from the masses. At this time, Engineer Zhang still wanted to use "These are Soviet blueprints" as a reason to explain. Yang Yufang said, "There is nothing wrong with the Soviet blueprints. While learning from the Soviet Union, we must look at our specific situation, which requires us to use our brains." Engineer Zhang then excused himself by saying, "There is not enough time for castings, and besides, the steel plates have already been purchased." Factory Director Wang pondered for a while and asked, "Since this is the case, why do you have to plane off 4 mm from the 12 mm steel plates, wasting four more steel plates for each hanging weight?" Engineer Zhang was ashamed and unable to answer.

　　The economic accountant calculated that using eight steel plates stacked together would perfectly make a 96 mm hanging weight. Compared with the original plan, it saved two tons of steel plates and more than 1,600 man-hours, equivalent to more than 15,000 yuan.　Jiang Shengnian

　　杨玉芳坚决向浪费现象作斗争
    三月二十七日下午，沈阳第一机床厂铆焊车间调度员杨玉芳在车间里看见三、四个工人正忙着裁钢板。他一打听原来是把这批钢裁开刨薄以后制造一批吊铊（也叫坠铊）。
    杨玉芳回到办公室，拿了图纸心里一琢磨，感到这里有问题：这种吊铊是粗拉活，使用铸件不是很节省吗，为什么要用十二公厘的钢板呢？即使用钢板，吊铊的总厚度是九十六公厘，用八层十二公厘的钢板就行了，为什么要把十二公厘的钢板刨去四公厘后再把十二层叠起来呢？
    他拿着图纸去同小组长柳世德商量。柳世德也觉得有问题，可是工程师、技术员审查过图纸，施工科也通过了，只好这么干。杨玉芳又去找施工员范永贵商量，范永贵很支持他的意见。他们两个人又详细地算了算，就由范永贵去找设计科。不料，设计科刘守威的答复是：“还是照原设计干吧！”张工程师更是不耐烦地说：“照章办事，施工一定要遵守规程制度。?
    杨玉芳决心要为节约国家财富进行斗争，当天又去找厂长，厂长正在开会，约他第二天早晨面谈。
    第二天刚响上班铃，杨玉芳已经同王厂长谈起来了。王厂长赞成老杨的钻研精神，支持这个建议，马上把张工程师找来共同研究。王厂长向张工程师说明用铸件制吊铊的建议是正确的，并指出工程技术人员应该尊重来自群众的正确意见。这时张工程师还想用“这是苏联图纸”为理由来解释。杨玉芳说：“苏联图纸是没有错的。在学习苏联的同时一定要看看咱们的具体情况，这就需要动动脑筋。”张工程师又推托说：“铸件时间来不及了，况且已经把钢板买来了。”王厂长沉吟了一会，问：“既然这样，为什么硬把十二公厘的钢板刨去四公厘，每个吊铊多费四块钢板呢？”张工程师惭愧得解答不出。
    经济核算员计算一下，用八块钢板叠在一起正好做成九十六公厘的吊铊。比原计划节省了两吨钢板和一千六百多个工时，折合人民币一万五千多元。　姜盛年
