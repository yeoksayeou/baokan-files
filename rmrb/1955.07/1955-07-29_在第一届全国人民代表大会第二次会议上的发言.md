At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, several representatives delivered speeches. Below are the transcripts of their speeches:

**Speech by Zhang Nanshen**

I have listened to the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuqun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I fully agree with and sincerely support them. Our five-year plan was meticulously prepared by the Communist Party of China as early as 1951. It was implemented in 1953, and now, after two years, we are presenting this plan, which includes the over-fulfillment of the first two years' targets. This cautious and thorough approach, this great and courageous spirit, is truly inspiring and motivating for the entire nation. It assures us that this five-year plan can be over-fulfilled and completed on schedule. This five-year plan is the foundation for the next two five-year plans. With this solid foundation, the subsequent plans will certainly be successfully completed. I congratulate our 600 million people and extend my congratulations to the future generations of our 600 million people.

Last month, I inspected Wuhan. At that time, the grain issue was extremely serious, and the citizens were extremely vocal about it. I paid special attention to this issue and investigated many cases. I felt that the problem was not due to a shortage of grain or insufficient distribution, but rather from irregular eating habits. In our country, the food intake of each person has never been accurately measured, not even by themselves. It is purely based on personal habit, with each person claiming they are full. This standard can be described as a messy account, meaning that each person's food intake is different. In other words, a thousand people have a thousand different standards, and ten thousand people have ten thousand different standards. In such a situation, no matter who is in charge, it is bound to be chaotic.

I started from the example of Wuhan, where the grain issue was not about a shortage of grain or insufficient distribution, but rather about the excessive allocation. Initially, I suspected that there was a shortage of grain, not enough for distribution, leading to complaints. Later, I found out that the Municipal People's Committee adopted a policy of wide distribution and narrow use, allocating rice generously. Last year, the allocation was already very generous, and this year, it was re-adjusted based on the statistics from April to September of last year. I investigated based on this re-adjustment. I found that in the Jianghan District of Hankou, at No. 15 Changli, Xia Lianrong's family of six was allocated 114 jin (approximately 114 pounds) of grain per month. He said he couldn't eat so much and returned 19 jin. Another example is the family of Luo Shusheng at No. 98 Wenming Road in Wuchang. After the allocation, his wife said it was too much and voluntarily returned 44 jin. Another example is the family of Zhang Cesheng at No. 528 Minzhu Road. I went to investigate, and it was reported that his family of ten was allocated 300 jin last year, reduced to 150 jin this year. I asked if the reduced amount was enough, and he said it was still manageable (last year, his family was allocated nearly double, and this was still considered generous). I said, "Why didn't you return some last year when you were allocated nearly double?" He said, "After the great flood last year, disaster-stricken relatives came to my house every day, and if I hadn't been allocated so much rice, I would have been in trouble. This year, the relatives have returned home to work, so I asked for less." There are many such examples, and I won't list them all. From these, we can prove that there is enough grain and it has been allocated generously. If the allocation is generous, the citizens should not complain; however, this is not the case. Please see the following materials:

1. In the Jianghan District of Hankou, at No. 15 Changli, Bian Changhou's family of four (two adults and two children) was allocated 88 jin per month, but they complained that it was not enough, saying it was half of what they needed, and that people were starving. After the working staff carefully calculated with his family, it turned out that only 80 jin were needed, and 8 jin were reduced.

2. At No. 199 Jianghan Road, Tu Xiuqing's family of three was allocated 75 jin, but Xiuqing complained that it was not enough. After the street office investigated, it was found that his family still had 377 jin of surplus grain from the previous month's over-allocation, and part of it had gone moldy.

3. At No. 441 Changdi Street in Qiaokou District, Xu Tianshun's family of three was allocated 78 jin, but they complained that it was not enough. After investigation, it was found that his family still had 288 jin stored.

4. This family's complaint is truly strange. At No. 26 Shijie Avenue, Zhang Yaotou complained that he was not allocated enough, but after investigation, it was found that he was allocated 160 jin for one person. He had more than 5 jin of grain per day. How can one person be allocated more than 5 jin of grain? It was found that the certificate was filled out incorrectly, and he, as one person, had received the grain of ten people. He did not even look at the certificate, and when people complained, he also joined in.

From these examples, we can summarize a few reasons for the complaints:

1. Lack of confidence in the government, fearing that the government might run out of grain and cause starvation. Some people complain more fiercely to secure more grain in case of shortages, as in the cases of Bian Changhou and Tu Xiuqing.

2. The government's grain allocation lacks a precise standard, and some people take advantage of loopholes to secure more grain for smuggling. This type of case has been reported by provincial and municipal authorities.

3. Imperialist and KMT spies take advantage of the citizens' complaints to create trouble secretly. This has been reported by provincial and municipal public security officials.

4. Some people, seeing others complain to secure more grain, also join in to secure more. This type is not uncommon.

5. Some people, without any investigation, join in the complaints when they see others complaining, as in the case of Zhang Yaotou.

These examples are worth our serious attention.

1. They relate to people's livelihoods.

2. They relate to social order.

3. This irregular standard of food intake, the waste involved, is not equivalent to cooking a few extra bowls of rice or dropping a few grains of rice while washing rice.

In summary, these examples are all due to the lack of a regular and appropriate standard of food intake. This bottom line must be investigated. To investigate this bottom line, I think we should consult scientific experts.

Therefore, I have submitted a proposal this time, which generally requests the government to invite experts in nutrition and physiology to work with relevant departments to study the scientific standards of regular food intake for various types. Everything written in the proposal, I do not need to repeat here. My speech today is only a supplement to my proposal.

In my proposal, I suggested that experts work with relevant departments because I think that our country has only been liberated for six or seven years, and the material conditions are not sufficient, as one can imagine. If experts who do not understand the actual situation draw up a European or American-style plan, our management departments may not be able to supply it. Therefore, it is necessary to base the plan on scientific principles and combine it with the facts of relevant departments for precise calculation and management. Only then can we achieve good results without being detached from reality.

In short, what is important today is to obtain a few classifications of regular food intake. Once we have a few classifications of regular food intake, it will be much easier to manage than the current chaotic situation where each person has a different food intake (600 million people would mean 600 million different food intakes). My intention is not like the old miser or the stingy person's diet, not allowing people to eat their fill. It is to ensure that everyone eats enough, not overeating to harm themselves and waste grain. It is to truly achieve our current slogan of eating enough without wasting.

Finally, I have a few words to declare. What I said earlier does not include Wuhan and other aspects beyond my personal observations. For example, the case of Zhang Yaotou, if the working staff can write his grain certificate incorrectly and allocate more than 100 jin, who can guarantee that they will not write less for a family with many people? If such a case exists, that family will starve. Or there may be other reasons for less allocation. I cannot say that everyone is allocated more. In short, my inspection time was short, and my observations were limited. I respectfully ask all representatives to forgive and guide me.

**Speech by Shao Lizi**

I have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget. I have also read the relevant documents and feel greatly inspired.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy is the first important document with historical significance after the formulation of the constitution. This plan is based on the basic tasks of the state in the transitional period as stipulated in the preamble of the constitution. When the First National People's Congress approved the constitution, there was a common understanding that the construction of socialism in our country should take socialist industrialization as the main body, with the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce as necessary components. This meeting solemnly discussed the five-year plan, making this understanding even clearer. This ensures that the five-year plan will be unanimously approved and implemented by all representatives and supported by the entire nation.

Everyone remembers that Article 15 of the constitution stipulates: "The state uses economic plans to guide the development and transformation of the national economy, to continuously improve productivity, to improve the material and cultural lives of the people, and to consolidate national independence and security." The first five-year plan begins to implement the provisions of the constitution, providing guarantees for the Chinese people to enjoy peace and happiness. What is particularly exciting is that Vice Premier Li Fuqun mentioned in his report: "With the direct help of the Soviet Union, our country will begin the peaceful use of atomic energy within five years, making it serve the national economy." This was something we could not even imagine when we approved the constitution last year! We thank the Soviet Union for its sincere aid, and we celebrate the great leap forward of the peace forces!

I returned from Helsinki to participate in this meeting and feel particularly excited. The World Peace Conference held in Helsinki had 1,800 representatives from 68 countries, issuing a declaration and resolutions from seven committees. It pointed out the direction of action for the urgent issues in the current international situation, reflecting the common wishes of the people of the world. This is another great victory for the peace forces. The representatives of the countries attending the conference showed great respect and warmth towards our country. They valued issues related to our country and the opinions of our representatives. Many of them had been to our country and praised our economic construction unanimously. Those who had not been to our country also admired our economic construction. We can say that the people of the world who love peace are convinced that the Chinese people love peace, that China's socialist economic construction is for creating peace and happiness for itself, and for promoting the peace forces of the world. I believe that the approval of the first five-year plan will be a great encouragement to the people of the world who love peace.

In May, I accompanied Vice Premier Ulanfu to participate in the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia as a member of the Chinese government delegation. I saw the great achievements of Czechoslovakia in building socialism in various aspects over the past 10 years, the improving material and cultural lives of the Czechoslovakian people, and felt the deep affection and enthusiasm of the Czechoslovakian people towards the Chinese people. They heard about our country's support for the decisions of the Warsaw Conference and expressed great joy, deeply recognizing the Chinese people's firm will and strong power to stop aggressive wars and defend world peace. They cared about our country's socialist economic construction, congratulated our country's victories in the struggle against imperialists, and regarded every achievement and victory of the Chinese people as their own achievements and victories. When we visited factories in Ostrava and other places, the workers pointed out the many machines ordered by our country and showed unlimited enthusiasm. The people of the socialist and democratic countries are closely united, indeed forming an invincible fortress of peace in the world. Vice Premier Li Fuqun emphasized in his report the great significance of the international aid from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to our construction, which is of great significance.

Comrades, please allow me to talk a little about my personal health situation. Before I came to Beijing in 1949, my health was not very good. Reading a little bit would make my head feel swollen, and walking too fast would make my chest feel painful. The doctor examined me and said my heart was weak, not suitable for climbing high or running fast, of course, not suitable for high-altitude flying, so I lost the opportunity to go abroad. In recent years, the above symptoms have gradually decreased. This spring, the doctor diagnosed that my heart and other parts are very normal. I reported this to the leadership and was able to accept the mission of going abroad in a short period of time. My age is increasing, but why is my health improving? People often say that living in the era of Mao Zedong is happy, and I am the best example. Before liberation, I was saddened by Jiang Jieshi's destruction of Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, going against Sun's "peaceful struggle to save China," and my heart was always sad and depressed, so my body was naturally damaged. Since liberation, seeing the entire mainland united in peace, economic recovery, and then beginning planned peaceful construction, the Chinese people not only enjoy peace and happiness themselves but also undertake the responsibility of defending world peace. My spirit is extremely happy, and my body is naturally strong. I believe that many comrades have the same feelings as me. We should all thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Looking at my real example, people in Taiwan can no longer believe the rumors that people on the mainland are suffering. "We are doing the great cause of seeking happiness for the people of the entire nation and future generations," although there are still difficulties ahead, and the struggle will be arduous, but difficulties can be overcome, and hardships are not to be feared. We are very excited and happy. The first five-year plan and the 1955 budget will definitely be completed and over-fulfilled! We should all raise our political vigilance and ideological awareness, work diligently, unite closely, and strive to complete this glorious task!

**Speech by Wu Yaozong**

I enthusiastically support the development of the national economy's first five-year plan of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on this plan.

The term "five-year plan" has been mentioned many times. I know it is a good thing; I roughly know about the great achievements of the Soviet Union's several five-year plans; when our country announced the implementation of the five-year plan, I was also happy. However, this is only an intellectual matter. Until this time, after listening to Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report and carefully reading the draft of the "five-year plan," I have a personal and intimate understanding of the "five-year plan." I believe that every Chinese person, after reading the report of the "five-year plan," will feel extremely excited and infinite joy. This plan is so concrete, so comprehensive, and so detailed. The entire plan not only has a high degree of scientificity, but its spirit is also full of love for the people. As Vice Premier Li Fuqun said: "We are doing the great cause of seeking happiness for the people of the entire nation and future generations." For thousands of years, most Chinese people have lived in poverty, enduring various exploitations and oppressions. They may have heard of the so-called golden age of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang and some high-sounding discussions about national governance, but these have never aroused anyone's enthusiasm. Who could have imagined that just three years after liberation, New China would begin the construction of the first "five-year plan," truly embarking on the path of prosperity and strength?

In this all-encompassing and colorful "five-year plan," there are many projects that we could not even dream of before. For example, the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River. In Chinese history, the Yellow River has always been the most disastrous river. Western writers often refer to the Yellow River as "China's sorrow." But the "five-year plan" will start the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River for the first time, building huge reservoirs and hydroelectric power stations in places like Sanmenxia. This not only permanently eliminates the Yellow River's disasters but also makes the Yellow River benefit countless people. Another example is: "Within five years, our country will begin the peaceful use of atomic energy construction, making it serve the national economy." In today's world, where imperialism wields atomic weapons to threaten peaceful people, we start the peaceful use of atomic energy in the first five-year plan. This is indeed an exciting thing.

Is our "five-year plan" just empty talk? During the reactionary KMT period, we also saw countless laws and regulations, saw complicated plans, but these things all ended up in the wastepaper basket soon after they appeared. Our "five-year plan" is completely different. It is not only feasible but will definitely be fully implemented. We know that every project and every number in the "five-year plan" have been carefully considered; the entire plan has also undergone long-term research and numerous revisions. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's government will definitely faithfully and victoriously complete the historical task of the first five-year plan.

The first five-year plan is not only of extremely important historical significance to our country but also of great significance to the defense of world peace. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have consistently adopted a peaceful foreign policy and consistently advocated the principle of peaceful coexistence. There is no better evidence to show New China's peaceful intentions than the first five-year plan. Within five years, the total expenditure for national economic construction and cultural education construction is 76.64 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 70 million taels of gold. If China were an aggressive country, if our policy were a war policy, we would not be able to use such a large amount of funds for national construction. We do not want to start a war, and we do not want to see any country start a war because our peaceful construction must have a peaceful environment to proceed. In the past two years, the international situation has eased somewhat. In recent months, the development of friendly relations and mutual visits between some countries in the East and West has made the expansion of the peaceful region more possible. The implementation of China's five-year construction plan will more clearly show the Chinese people's love for peace.

The first five-year plan not only shows the Chinese people's love for peace but also, because this plan is the first plan to make our country prosperous and strong and the people happy, as Vice Premier Li Fuqun said: its implementation will also strengthen the forces of world peace and democracy.

The design and implementation of the first five-year plan have opened up a new era in Chinese history. For this epoch-making development, we must thank the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; we must thank the great Soviet people for their sincere and selfless aid to our country; we must thank all brotherly countries for their sympathy and cooperation. We must also pay high tribute to the laboring people and workers who are already on various posts and will participate in the work, striving to complete the first five-year plan.

The completion of the five-year plan is not just the government's responsibility but also depends on the efforts and cooperation of the entire nation. Every Chinese person should make a direct or indirect contribution to the completion of the five-year plan.

In the past five years, the self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating movement of Chinese Christianity has made great progress. This is an anti-imperialist and patriotic movement. Through this movement, the national consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of Christians across the country have been greatly enhanced. Christians across the country have actively participated in various patriotic movements and undertaken various key tasks at the local level. Many Christians have performed well in their work and set examples. The first five-year plan is the beginning of changing the face of China, creating infinite happiness for the people of the entire nation and our descendants. We Christians across the country wholeheartedly support this plan and are willing to contribute our greatest efforts to its implementation.

Imperialism, especially American imperialism, has always adopted a hostile attitude towards New China; they have also adopted a hostile attitude towards the three-self patriotic movement of New China's Christianity. In the past five years, they have tried to use various methods to sabotage this movement and split it. We Christians in the country's churches and various Christian organizations must be vigilant, distinguish between friends and enemies, and between right and wrong, and on the basis of anti-imperialism and patriotism, strengthen our unity, expand our unity, and with actual patriotic actions, strike at the conspiracies of imperialism. In this way, we can make actual contributions to the sacred cause of building the motherland and defending world peace.

**Speech by Yu Pingbo**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan. I enthusiastically support the draft of the first five-year plan because this plan is a program with decisive significance for the Communist Party of China to lead the people in striving to achieve the total tasks of the transitional period. It makes me see clearly the bright and glorious future of our great motherland's prosperity and strength, making me extremely excited and inspired.

Vice Premier Li's report points out: "The implementation of the five-year plan is a special form of class struggle under the current environment." Many facts show that class struggle is particularly sharp during the transitional period. The exploiting classes will not willingly be eliminated. Those counter-revolutionary elements will definitely try every means to sabotage our plan. From the materials exposed across the country, it can be seen that there are still some residual counter-revolutionary elements nationwide, reactionary landlords and rich peasants, incorrigible criminal offenders, and reactionary sects, who want to sabotage our national undertakings from all sides. To ensure the successful implementation of the five-year plan, we must resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary elements' sabotage activities.

Open counter-revolutionary elements are relatively easy to eliminate, but hidden ones are more difficult to discover, and their harm is more serious. Therefore, we must be particularly resolute in eliminating the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in our ranks, so they cannot carry out sabotage against our great socialist construction cause. For example, the recently exposed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a prominent case. Hu Feng hid in the revolutionary ranks for more than twenty years, carrying out organized and planned anti-party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies, which were finally exposed and crushed. This is a great victory for the party and the people. We draw profound lessons from this and must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism. In this way, we can raise our political vigilance and ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements, exposing those hidden counter-revolutionary elements. The conspiracies and tricks of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have been smashed under the mighty blow of the party and the people. All other counter-revolutionary elements will also be exposed and smashed by the people one by one.

We not only need to raise vigilance and thoroughly suppress counter-revolutionaries to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism to carry out ideological reform. At the same time, to fully implement the great five-year plan, we must also strengthen study and carry out ideological reform. Chairman Mao pointed out in the third session of the People's Political Consultative Conference: "Ideological reform, first of all, the ideological reform of various intellectuals, is an important condition for our country to thoroughly implement democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually carry out industrialization." Chairman Mao's instruction is absolutely correct, and I have a deeper understanding of it today.

I personally feel that like me, old intellectuals must actively reform to contribute to the great socialist construction cause, do some things that I can and should do, and fulfill my glorious duty. In the past, I spread idealist wrong thoughts in the "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, but I did not know it myself. I thank comrades from all over the country for their valuable criticism. This is a serious and sharp ideological struggle. At that time, I could not help but feel quite painful. However, half a year later today, after this study and tempering, I understood many truths and understood the flaws in my thinking methods for decades that I did not recognize before.

First, I want to say that I have initially studied Marxism-Leninism, recognized the harm of reactionary bourgeois literary theories, and corrected the direction of literary research. Of course, my understanding is still shallow, but for me, it should be said that the gains are great. Before liberation, I did not study Marxism-Leninism. After liberation, although I studied, I did not connect it with my work. Therefore, I still only focused on my work and neglected politics. Now I know that this is a path of detachment from reality and detachment from the masses, detachment from class struggle. At that time, I mistakenly thought that Marxism-Leninism had little to do with my research work, that comrades working in politics, law, finance, and economics must study Marxism-Leninism, but research in classical literature like "Dream of the Red Chamber" did not necessarily need to study. Now I deeply understand that studying Marxism-Leninism, reforming thoughts, is very important for every intellectual and every revolutionary work. Otherwise, we will inevitably make mistakes, even if we use effort and hard work, want to do something beneficial to the people, the result will be the opposite, and it will have a bad effect on the country and the people. This is a painful lesson, and I am willing to provide it for everyone's reference.

Next, in the process of criticizing my wrong thoughts, the concern and help from comrades from the Communist Party, democratic parties, and literary circles made me very moved, making me concretely understand that the Communist Party's policy of uniting and reforming intellectuals is completely correct. In this way, combining serious criticism with sincere concern and help, it completely conforms to Chairman Mao's instruction: "Starting from unity, through criticism and struggle, to achieve the goal of unity." Such ideological reform not only does not hinder unity but, on the contrary, strengthens and consolidates unity. The criticism within the people and the exposure and elimination of counter-revolutionary groups are two different things. Some people have misunderstandings about the criticism of academic and ideological thoughts, which is completely wrong. Truth can only be reached through free debate. I am determined to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly correct my past idealist wrong thoughts, work hard, and serve the literature and affairs of the people with correct viewpoints and methods. At the same time, I want to warn the KMT reactionary clique in Taiwan and all counter-revolutionary elements hidden on the mainland that they try to sow discord and create trouble in the self-reform movement of intellectuals, which is in vain and will definitely fail.

Finally, I say, let us intellectuals closely unite under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and strive for the completion of the first five-year plan, for the great cause of seeking long-term happiness for the people of the entire nation and our descendants.

**Speech by Li Chunqing**

In our five-year plan, there is a place in China that does not have its figures; in our great cause of building the motherland, there is a part of the Chinese people who cannot participate. This place is Taiwan, and this part of the Chinese people is the Taiwanese people.

I want to say a few words for the Taiwanese people.

When China had almost no industry, Japan seized Taiwan. The Taiwanese people have suffered greatly and deeply understand the importance of national industrialization. If we say that after the realization of two five-year plans, the industrial foundation will catch up with and surpass Japan, I believe that no one will be happier than the Taiwanese people. Those who have been separated from their motherland for fifty years and are still not protected by their motherland, I cannot express in words how much they need a strong China! The five-year plan will make China head towards socialist industrialization and gradually become prosperous and strong. I believe that the Taiwanese people's support for the five-year plan is profound; the desire to realize the five-year plan is urgent.

However, for the Taiwanese people, the current reality is cruel: while the people of the mainland are rejoicing today, they live in misery.

Taiwan is the Taiwanese people's Taiwan. In the Sui and Tang dynasties, it was still a barren island. Generation after generation of Chinese laborers opened it up with their blood and sweat, making Taiwan what it is today with its richness and beauty. Now Taiwan can produce 800,000 tons of sugar, 2 million tons of rice, 30 million jin of bananas, 20 million jin of tea, produce 70% of the world's camphor, and has 500,000 kilowatts of power equipment. The entire island has 70% of its land covered with various good timber. Such rich resources should be included in our five-year plan and used for the motherland. However, they are now seized by the KMT clique, who seize 90% of Taiwan's industry and 70% of its land. This group of locusts is destroying the Taiwanese people's homes. At the same time, the United States, through various treasonous treaties signed with the KMT, is continuously sucking the blood of Taiwan's economy.

We who came from old China have all suffered the disasters of the KMT's rule. Today, those terrible disasters are concentrated on the Taiwanese people. The KMT is brutally exploiting the Taiwanese people, and the degree of exploitation is increasing. For example, in 1953, Taiwan's budget had 83% of its revenue and other extortions from taxes. In 1954, Taiwan's tax revenue was 37 times more than in 1949, and the salt tax alone was 326 times more. Under the double plunder and extortion of the United States and the KMT, the Taiwanese people with labor power are massively unemployed, many women are forced into prostitution, and children are universally suffering from serious diseases. Taiwan is everywhere with people selling their children, and every family has to fight against hunger and even death. Not only that, the KMT, to maintain its dark rule, has special agents everywhere in Taiwan, monitoring everyone's actions, endangering everyone's freedom and safety. The lives of the Taiwanese people are not guaranteed. Taiwan has become a big prison, and the surrounding sea is the prison wall.

Comrades, 900 years before Columbus discovered the New World, the Chinese people had already started developing Taiwan. 400 years before the birth of the United States, China had already established local governments in Taiwan. In local administration, Taiwan has always been a part of Fujian until after the Sino-French War in 1887, when Taiwan was established as a province. The relationship between Taiwan and Fujian is like the relationship between Hainan Island and Guangdong. Taiwan is Chinese territory, which has never been in doubt. The United States has no reason to occupy Chinese territory, Taiwan; our liberation of Taiwan is the exercise of national sovereignty, an internal affair of China. The United States has no right to interfere with and obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan. We know that 8 million Taiwanese people are all Chinese people, with 98% being Han people. Among the Han people, the vast majority are Minnan people, followed by Hakka people from Guangdong, and then people from various provinces in China. There are also 200,000 highland people. In Taiwan, there is no such thing as a "Taiwanese nation" as some people say, and there is no such thing as "Taiwan independence." All the fallacies of "Taiwan independence," "Taiwan neutrality," "Taiwan trusteeship," "Taiwan public referendum," etc., are all plots of imperialism and are a great insult to the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people, including the highland people, have a motherland, they love their great motherland, they have a glorious history of struggle, and for hundreds of years, they have fought against foreign invasions, defended their motherland's territory, Taiwan, and shed blood. Now, they are still bravely fighting for their return to their motherland—the People's Republic of China. The Taiwanese people firmly oppose the United States' occupation of Taiwan. They did not become slaves of Japan in the past, and they will not become slaves of the United States today. The Taiwanese people, in February 1947, rose up to resist the KMT's brutal rule. The Chinese people on the mainland have already overthrown the KMT's regime, and the Chinese people in Taiwan also do not want this traitorous regime. The Taiwanese people support the motherland's decisions to liberate Taiwan and eagerly await the day of liberation.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. The United States' occupation of Taiwan not only destroys China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, threatens our country's security and peaceful construction but has also caused tension in the Far East, making the people of Asia and the world uneasy. The Chinese people love peace. The government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly expressed its willingness to sit down and talk with the United States about easing the tension in the Far East, especially the tension in the Taiwan region. We want to ask: Does the United States government want to sit down and talk? Does it want peace?

It should be pointed out that the United States is still continuously strengthening its military forces in Taiwan, actively preparing for war in the Taiwan region, and has recently handed over more than 200 jet aircraft to the KMT. Just a few days before this conference opened, the U.S. fleet also held large-scale exercises in the waters of Penghu. Taiwan is more than 5,000 miles away from the United States, and its security is unrelated to the United States. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the United States' war threats and cannot allow the United States to attempt to occupy China's territory, Taiwan, for a long time. The United States government should immediately withdraw its armed forces, including the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the U.S. Air Force, and other military forces, from Taiwan. The Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States. If the imperialists insist on imposing war on us, we should tell them: the Chinese people, tempered by war, are not afraid of war.

We believe that the cause of the five-year plan will advance victoriously, and Taiwan will gradually approach liberation. I request the conference to pass the five-year plan. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai said in his report: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army must 'actively prepare to liberate the motherland's territory, Taiwan,'" I want to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Taiwanese people living in darkness have light with Chairman Mao; they have the confidence of final victory with 600 million brothers and sisters. Taiwan will definitely be liberated. The Taiwanese people will definitely return.

**Speech by Sheng Puhua**

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's disasters and the development of water resources, I fully agree with and support these reports.

The first five-year plan is formulated based on the requirements of the state's tasks during the transitional period. Therefore, it concentrates the main forces to prioritize the construction of heavy industry, which is the central link for laying the foundation for socialist industrialization. This is necessary for realizing our country's prosperity and the people's happiness. It has planned specific paths. For many years, the national dream of industrialization has begun to be gradually realized. This is how inspiring and exciting it is! The 1954 national budget shows the splendid results of the correct implementation of the 1954 national budget, and the 1955 national budget implements the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, in order to accumulate funds and ensure the needs of national economic construction, especially heavy industry construction, and to maintain a certain amount of fiscal reserve power. It is completely correct. From the report of the Standing Committee's work, we know that Pan Hannian's counter-revolutionary activities have been exposed, making me extremely indignant. The Standing Committee, based on the request of Prosecutor-General Zhang Dingxian of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, has approved the arrest and trial of the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng in accordance with the law. This is a great victory for the people of the entire nation in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and it is a great relief.

The first five-year plan is carried out on the basis of the recovery of the national economy. In the past five years, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, our country has achieved great victories on all fronts. The leading role and position of socialist economy in the national economy have been greatly enhanced with the consolidation of people's democratic dictatorship. Due to the increasing trust and support of the people of the entire nation for the Communist Party, due to the long-term, comprehensive, and selfless aid of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union, and due to the compilation of this plan, which has undergone practice and discussion, many supplements and revisions, a lot of experience has been accumulated. This provides favorable conditions and a solid material foundation for the full implementation of the first five-year plan. We have full confidence to strive for its implementation!

Our country's socialist construction is based on socialist industrialization, while the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are two necessary components. This three-in-one is indivisible. Since liberation, private industrialists and businessmen have, under the leadership and education of the working class and the Communist Party of China, improved their ideological understanding to varying degrees. However, some still have vague ideological understanding when they encounter certain specific problems, and there are still a few who persist in resisting transformation. This is specifically reflected in the fact that many private industrialists and businessmen have initially recognized that China cannot take the capitalist road and can only take the socialist road. Therefore, in accepting socialist transformation, more and more capitalist industry and commerce have taken various forms of state capitalism, such as joint ventures, processing, ordering, sales, and agency sales. They understand that enterprise transformation must be combined with personal ideological transformation, strengthen learning, and work actively. In improving management and operation, in improving quality and reducing costs, in responding to the country's call, in patriotism and law-abiding, they have made certain progress. However, there are still many private industrialists and businessmen who, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of combining enterprise transformation with personal ideological transformation, accept transformation only to relieve the enterprise's difficulties. Some welcome the government's arrangement for the enterprise but neglect personal transformation. Some have doubts and concerns about accepting the leadership of state-owned economy. Some think that once the enterprise is jointly operated, it is "all set," and they can "enjoy the fruits of labor." These ideological situations, to varying degrees, hinder the self-transformation of private industrialists and businessmen. In addition, there are a few who insist on errors, resist transformation, and engage in illegal activities. These people must be firmly fought against.

In addition, private industrialists and businessmen have mixed and confused ideological understanding of international situations and political issues. For example, after the People's Daily exposed materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, some people thought that the Hu Feng incident was a matter of the literary circle and had nothing to do with the business circle. Some people thought that in the future, one should be careful when speaking, so as not to be regarded as a member of the Hu Feng group. Some people confused Hu Feng's "two-faced" with the "two-facedness" of the national bourgeoisie, thus lacking a correct understanding of the boundary between revolution and counter-revolution.

The ideological understanding of private industrialists and businessmen lags behind the development of objective situations. The main reason is insufficient study. First, they themselves do not study enough, only pay attention to immediate gains and losses, do not see the country's and their own distant future, do not care about domestic and international affairs, and in action, they appear hesitant, passive, lacking the spirit of a master. On the other hand, we have not done enough in assisting the government in carrying out ideological education for private industrialists and businessmen. Especially, it is not extensive and in-depth. Except for a part of the backbone of the business circle, the vast majority of private industrialists and businessmen have not had sufficient opportunities to frequently hear reports on policies and current affairs propaganda, let alone organized discussions and studies. The methods of propaganda and education are also relatively rigid, tending to be formulaic, not lively and vivid, not connected with reality. The work of textual propaganda is also not plain enough, so the effect is not great.

It is undeniable that the backward ideological understanding of private industrialists and businessmen will affect the country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, thus also affecting the progress of our socialist construction. In the future, we must overcome the shortcomings that have existed in the past, do a good job in the ideological education of private industrialists and businessmen, promote everyone to study hard, correct their understanding, follow the national plan, practice economy, eliminate waste, accumulate funds for the country's construction, and complete the tasks entrusted by the country. At the same time, I also hope that comrades from the state-owned economic departments, in the process of leading the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the ideological transformation of individual capitalists. Private industrialists and businessmen must, on the basis of improving political understanding, seriously accept socialist transformation, correctly play their role in the construction of the five-year plan, and work together with the people of the entire nation, diligently, vigilantly, distinguish between friends and enemies, prevent the conspiracies and sabotage of domestic and foreign enemies, and strive for the full implementation of the first five-year plan!

**Speech by Cao Yu**

These days, when we are sincerely discussing the first five-year plan and the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's disasters and the development of water resources, when we are discussing the great cause of seeking happiness for the people of the entire nation and future generations with great joy and confidence, I am thinking, if the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group had not been exposed by now, if Hu Feng had not been arrested, wouldn't Hu Feng, this hidden KMT spy, still be among us, also participating in this discussion? I deeply feel that we were not vigilant enough against hidden counter-revolutionary elements in the past, which is so frightening!

I thank the party, the government, and the timely exposure of this counter-revolutionary group, the arrest and trial of Hu Feng, this extremely evil counter-revolutionary. This great relief not only shows that our government is the most democratic government but also the most powerful government.

When I think of the malice, cunning, and hatred of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group towards our people's cause, my heart is filled with anger. But today is not the time to express how angry we are with counter-revolutionary elements; it is already at this critical moment. We must be determined to go through this struggle, temper ourselves into sharp-eyed and strong warriors, so that all counter-revolutionary elements will have nowhere to hide when they encounter us!

We must resolutely refute such words: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is just a group of writers; muddy eels in a ditch cannot become dragons, how can they cause trouble? Writers? People say that writers are engineers of the soul, but these things are executioners of the soul. Not to mention the harm of their reactionary thoughts to many people, just look at the dirty history of these things: Hu Feng, who appeared as a revolutionary literary theorist, was originally a political worker of the anti-communist troops that besieged Jinggangshan; Lu Yuan, who appeared as a poet, was originally a KMT spy of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization; Zhang Ke, who appeared as a novelist, was originally an instructor of the KMT Central Military Academy; A Ling, who appeared as a critic, was originally a tactics instructor of the KMT Military Academy; Jia Shifang, who appeared as a professor of literature, was originally a human trafficker. They hate the Communist Party, hate people's democratic dictatorship, hate us discussing the eternal cause of the Chinese people here so enthusiastically. They use "dark intelligence" to try to disintegrate our revolutionary ranks, with the false face of Marxism-Leninism, thus infiltrating our economy, culture, military, schools, and various agencies, spying on party secrets, deceiving the title of Communist Party members. Their leader even infiltrated the highest state power organ—the National People's Congress. These poisonous elements have deeply infiltrated our liver. We still dare to say that these are muddy eels in a ditch, that they cannot cause trouble to the people? All the people of China hate them and want to kill these poisonous snakes. The KMT gang in Taiwan is crying and wailing, lamenting the loss of their most capable dog and spy, finally perishing in the hands of the people. The KMT is crying, and the people are laughing. This is an extremely great victory for us in the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements!

We must resolutely refute such words: The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng group are indeed evidence-confirmed, so why bother with propaganda and learning, wasting our precious time for construction? The counter-revolutionary sabotage activities reported in the newspapers these days have already refuted this simplistic thought. Cruel facts show that if we do not decide to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, our beautiful construction today will add targets for counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage. In this heart-pounding struggle, I deeply feel that the idea of peace and liberalism will make people blind, making people unable to see the serious class struggle in front of us. I think that the great Communist Party is the most tightly organized, with the highest political vigilance and the strongest ideological leadership. However, the enemy—counter-revolutionary elements, using various disguises, using "dark intelligence," still want to infiltrate, sabotage our cause. The enemy is not so stupid; they also know that the fortress is easiest to attack from within. I think, the enemy can infiltrate the Communist Party, then why can't they infiltrate various democratic parties, people's organizations, and various industrial and commercial institutions? In fact, in these parties and organizations, institutions, haven't hidden enemies been discovered? We cannot simplify this struggle; we must learn well in this struggle. The tactics used by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group to attack us are the common tactics used by all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to attack the people. It is the most typical. By deeply studying the "materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group," we can raise our vigilance and help us see through the false faces of all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

We must resolutely refute such words: Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionary elements have actually been hiding among us for many years. The enemy is so good at disguising, making us feel that everyone around us can be suspected, as if this is raising vigilance. What will be the effect if such a thought spreads? That is, in our revolutionary ranks, it will cause confusion, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad, making good people lose confidence in the revolutionary cause, making bad people and counter-revolutionary elements take the opportunity to slip through. It will cause a chaotic situation. The party has always taught us to seek truth from facts; groundless suspicion has nothing to do with the revolutionary vigilance that a revolutionary worker should have. In our revolutionary ranks, more than 95% are good people, and only a few are hidden counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements. Building a hydroelectric power station requires the strength of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people, but destroying it only requires one hidden counter-revolutionary element. Therefore, although counter-revolutionary elements are few, we must unite and use all our strength to eliminate them. We have the correct leadership, we now have the high political awareness of the broad masses, and most importantly, we have the weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is very scientific, very realistic, and invincible.

In my personal study, I have two realizations. First, to be vigilant against all counter-revolutionary elements, we must first be vigilant against our own individualism and liberalism. "Individualism and liberalism are good friends of counter-revolutionary elements," anyone who has seriously studied the "materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group" will recognize that this sentence is absolutely correct. Second, after this study, I feel that I must be closer to the Communist Party and the people's government, and must be absolutely loyal and honest to the Communist Party and the people's government. This is not only my personal requirement but also a requirement that naturally arises from the hearts of those who love the country, the party, and the people. I deeply feel that if a person can be completely loyal to the party, he will naturally have sufficient courage and strength to fight against counter-revolutionary elements. The fact is like this: good people want to be closer to the party and the government, and the closer they get, the closer they get. When all good people are completely close to the party, those hidden counter-revolutionary elements will be isolated and lose their hiding place.

I love our motherland, not only because it has given us happiness, democracy, freedom, and a true harmonious family feeling, but also because in the past five years, from the progress and construction achievements in all aspects, I have felt that labor has never played such a great role, and being a Chinese person has never been so proud. Standing on this stage, I feel that all the people of China are looking at us with happy eyes, full of joy and confidence, eagerly caring about the great cause of socialist construction that we are discussing today. However, they more urgently entrusted us not to let counter-revolutionary elements act in our happy country again, not to allow socialist construction to be sabotaged even a little. This solemn entrustment, this entrustment related to the lives, careers, and happiness of countless people, we must do it. Today, the political vigilance and class awareness of the people of the entire nation have indeed been greatly enhanced. There is an old saying, "ten eyes watching, ten hands pointing," which is already severe enough. Now, we have the eyes of 600 million people watching, the hands of 600 million people guarding. All counter-revolutionary elements will definitely not escape the hands of the people.

**Speech by Ye Jianying**

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuqun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would like to express my opinions on the consolidation of national defense.

Our country's socialist economic construction, in addition to needing correct leadership and the joint efforts of the people of the entire nation, also needs a long-term international peaceful environment. In the ten years since the war, the U.S. imperialist group has implemented a policy of strength, organized an aggressive group, and actively prepared for war. During this period, the international situation has always been tense. However, the conditions for easing and leading to peace are possible. The strength of the socialist and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and united; the diplomatic policy of peaceful coexistence advocated by them has been supported and supported by the broad masses of the world. Due to the justice of the peace cause, it has gained strong support from the people of various countries in the world. These are important factors that make it possible for us to strive for a long-term international peaceful environment. The current international situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace. We welcome this trend. But striving for peace is a long-term and arduous great struggle. This struggle is complex and tortuous. We must continue to strive, strive to establish friendly relations with all countries that advocate peaceful coexistence, take on the cause of peace, and give unremitting exposure and resolute counterattacks to all forces that obstruct and sabotage peace.

However, we must not underestimate the imperialist's aggressive ambitions. U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory, Taiwan, and obstructs our people's liberation of Taiwan in various ways. The ruling clique of the United States is actively preparing for war under various "peaceful" disguises. The U.S. military expenditure has increased significantly compared to before the war; it has maintained nearly 300,000 active-duty troops and about 240,000 reserve troops, and continues to vigorously develop the air force, using atomic weapons as conventional weapons in the army, actively preparing for atomic war. To expand its aggressive power abroad, the U.S. military forces have also established a large number of military bases on other countries' territories. At the same time, everyone knows that under the instructions of the United States, in recent years, various aggressive military alliances have also been established, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Paris Agreements, the Turkey-Iraq-Pakistan Agreement, the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," etc. The United States has also signed a series of agreements with Japan, the Li Zongren group, the KMT gang, and South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem. Recently, the United States has also signed a so-called "U.S.-Cambodia Military Aid Agreement" with Cambodia and is negotiating a similar agreement with the Kingdom of Laos. The ruling clique of the United States is so enthusiastic about establishing military bases and organizing various military groups around the world. Their intention is to: rearm West Germany and Japan; and to pull in Britain, France, and other capitalist countries, as well as some countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Near East, and North Africa, to serve the war profits of U.S. monopolies.

The U.S. imperialist's ambition to monopolize the world is extremely arrogant. For this sinister purpose, it is possible that they will rashly embark on a new military adventure. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must be fully prepared and vigilant for this!

Facing this situation, in order to defend the motherland and the people's safety, to defend the motherland's socialist construction, to liberate our territory, Taiwan, and to prepare for the sudden attack of the aggressors, we must take various possible measures to continue to strengthen the Chinese People's Liberation Army. That is, we must have a sufficient number of the latest modern equipment to arm the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Because, facing us is a well-equipped imperialist army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, in several decades of revolutionary wars, has often been in a situation of inferior equipment, but it has defeated powerful enemies. However, if we add modern weapons, we can more powerfully counter such aggressors' attacks and more certainly win in anti-aggression wars. But some people seem to still not understand this point. They think that now we only need to concentrate on socialist economic construction, and we do not need to pay so much attention to national defense construction. They do not understand that national defense construction must rely on national industrialization, but we must maintain sufficient national defense forces while carrying out socialist economic construction; otherwise, we will be in a fragile situation. If imperialism launches an aggressive war against us, we will face the danger of losing national independence and sabotaging the socialist cause. Some people also have such doubts: Will our proposal to strengthen national defense forces prompt imperialism to launch a war earlier? They do not understand a truth: The weakness of imperialism is manifested in bullying the weak and fearing the strong. If we have a strong national defense force that can resist all aggressors, we can maintain peace and postpone or prevent the outbreak of aggressive wars; if we are weak and powerless, we will invite war and cannot obtain peace.

Currently, our army's equipment has improved significantly compared to before. But we should see that the level of industrial development in our country's current stage cannot provide the army with a large number of the latest equipment. This situation is obviously not in line with the needs of modern national defense. To change this backward situation, we must accelerate the development of our country's industry, especially heavy industry; and before our country's industry is established, it is also necessary to adopt the temporary method of foreign orders within a certain range. Stalin once said: "Without heavy industry, it is impossible to defend the country, so quickly start developing heavy industry. If this matter is delayed a little, it is equivalent to failure." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." These instructions have great guiding significance and practical significance for our country's socialist economic construction and national defense construction. We fully support our country's first five-year plan, which focuses on the development of heavy industry.

Modern armed forces must also have a strong reserve of manpower. The implementation of the compulsory military service system provides a reliable guarantee for our country to establish a strong reserve of military service. In his report on the draft of the Military Service Law, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai pointed out: "Because of the implementation of the compulsory military service system, there is a system of regular recruitment and regular retirement. Every year, there is a batch of soldiers who have completed their active service in the People's Liberation Army units, who have been tempered by actual military life, and who retire and enter the first-class reserve. Every year, there is a large number of citizens who meet the conditions for active service but have not been recruited for active service and are enrolled in the second-class reserve. At the same time, every year, there are officers who have completed their active service and enter the officer reserve, and there are also a large number of reserve officers cultivated and accumulated from schools and non-military systems of state organs and enterprises. We have a large number of well-trained reserve soldiers and a sufficient number of reserve officers. We have the material guarantee of the socialist state industry that is growing. We are not afraid of any enemy's aggression. Once imperialism dares to launch an aggressive war against our country, we can quickly form a sufficient number of troops on this strong foundation to give a resolute counterattack and defend the country's security." It can be seen that the implementation of the compulsory military service system has an urgent and significant meaning for strengthening our country's national defense forces. The Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly supports our country's compulsory military service system. To thoroughly implement the compulsory military service system, we must train our troops well and do a good job in our schools.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary armed force established by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong based on Marxism-Leninism. History has proven that the quality of this armed force is excellent, and its combat effectiveness is strong. To meet the needs of national defense, in recent years, the army, navy, and air force units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the sincere help of Soviet experts, have been universally carrying out modern, regular combat training and education in tactics, technology, regulations, and politics, and the training effect is good. In the army, after several years of training, the command art and management ability of each officer have improved significantly on the original basis. They not only mastered and grasped the tactics and technology of their own forces but also learned the command art of modern combined forces. Each soldier and non-commissioned officer has further mastered their weapons and learned combat actions under new conditions. However, based on the requirements of modern warfare, we should admit that our army is still in a relatively backward state in mastering modern military technology and using modern warfare combat skills. Obviously, this is not in line with the tasks assigned to us by the current situation. Therefore, we cannot be complacent. We should continue to study hard and catch up. Only when we master the command art and combat skills required by modern warfare, and at the same time, we are fully prepared in terms of ideology and materials to deal with sudden incidents, can we confidently give a fatal blow to the enemy who invades our country at any time and place.

Here, I would like to mention one more thing. To cultivate reserve officers and to enhance young students' national defense awareness, according to the provisions of Article 53 and Article 54 of the draft of the Military Service Law, we will, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of National Defense, after this year's preparation and trial, starting from 1956, gradually implement necessary military training for students in senior middle schools and above. This measure, I believe, will definitely receive the support and support of the people of the entire nation.

Consolidating people's political power and ensuring domestic order is an indispensable and organic part of consolidating national defense. National defense not only refers to our country's borders but also includes the vast rear areas. Without a consolidated rear area, the security of national defense is difficult to imagine. Everyone knows that our country's political power and the vast rear areas are consolidated and stable; but we must not be deceived by the current "peaceful" situation. We should be soberly aware that the current domestic class struggle situation is not easing but is becoming more acute and complex. The resistance and sabotage of various counter-revolutionary elements to socialist construction and socialist transformation are more intense and more ferocious. The danger of counter-revolutionary restoration still exists in reality. The exposure of the Hu Feng and Pan Hannian counter-revolutionary cases is a concrete "snapshot" of the current class struggle situation. Therefore, to defend our country's socialist construction, to defend the people's happy future, we must, while accelerating the improvement of national defense forces, strengthen the responsibility of the public security forces, assist the judicial organs to severely suppress domestic counter-revolutionary elements, and smash all the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements hidden in various organizations and the army with two-faced colors. The most important political task facing our people is to enhance political sensitivity, defend the socialist construction of our motherland, and resolutely liberate our territory, Taiwan.

**Speech by Liu Wenhui**

After listening to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuqun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I feel very excited and satisfied.

However, what makes us satisfied is definitely not satisfactory to our enemies. As Vice Premier Li Fuqun pointed out in his report: The implementation of the five-year plan is a special form of class struggle under the current environment. The enemies of the people will not willingly accept their failure; they will definitely try every means to sabotage our five-year plan. Therefore, we must keep our eyes open, be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage activities at all times, and continue to severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements. This is also a struggle task that we must carry out to implement the five-year plan.

In the past, my understanding of class struggle was very inadequate. This time, when we went to inspect Newfan County and Peng County in Wenchuan Prefecture, it made me deeply realize the seriousness of counter-revolutionary sabotage.

The sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements are varied. From the situation of the 16 townships and 28 villages we inspected this time, in rural areas, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements can generally be divided into the following categories:

First, spreading rumors to disrupt revolutionary order. They slander the party and the government, trying to disrupt the relationship between the government and the people; they distort policies, trying to incite backward masses and obstruct the implementation of policies; they create threatening reactionary slogans and rumors, threatening cadres and peasants, and disturbing people's minds; they spread reactionary slogans and rumors, maliciously cursing the people's revolutionary government, fantasizing about the restoration of reactionary rule, which is the most blatant manifestation of the enemy class's hatred and resistance towards new China's society.

For example, during the signature march against the use of atomic weapons, the reactionaries in Peng County openly wrote on a small flag: "Firmly use atomic weapons," deliberately omitting the word "oppose."

Second, sabotaging production and harming livestock.

For example, the reactionary rich peasants in Peng County removed the official canal sluice gate in May this year, affecting the irrigation of more than 200 mu of fields. Some scattered weeds in other people's seedlings. Some used large stones to damage other people's seedlings.

In the Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jixian Township, Peng County, the seedlings of 1.2 mu of land were destroyed four times in a row by saboteurs.

In the Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huoding Township, Newfan County, 70 pigs suddenly died last year, and it was later found that the landlord class had planned to secretly harm them.

Third, plotting to kill cadres and activists.

For example, in Shijian Village, Fanjiang Township, Newfan County, the habitual criminal Jia Yulin, dissatisfied with the village head's repeated education, took advantage of his guard being down and stabbed him to death with a small knife.

In the 18th village of Junzhun Township, Peng County, the landlord Xie Ziqing (a controlled person) often spread rumors, and the Youth League member Xu Caigui collected his materials and reported them to the government. He was dissatisfied and hid a knife by the road, attempting to assassinate but failed.

In the 7th village of Mengyang Township, Peng County, after the unified purchase and sale last year, a middle peasant (activist) was murdered by the enemy in a pond, and the criminal has not been found yet.

Fourth, using corrupt methods to demoralize cadres.

For example, the rich peasant Luo Kaiqu in Peng County used his sister to carry out a honey trap, corrupting 48 cadres, Youth League members, and others in two years. After the unified purchase and sale in 1953, many cadres were demoralized by the enemy. According to the statistics of Newfan County in 1954, out of 1,272 party, league, and cadre members in the county, 171 were bought off.

Fifth, arson.

For example, in the 8th village of Jixian Township, Peng County, there were 8 fires in one and a half months this year, burning down 40 households and 200 rooms. It was later found that the criminal was the Yiguandao.

In Liziji Township, Newfan County, the habitual criminal Luo Keyun, who participated in the rebellion after liberation, set 8 fires in 6 days and spread the rumor that it was the "little god child" who set the fire, making the peasants afraid to stay at home, affecting production.

More seriously, the enemy's sabotage and resistance are not only everywhere but also their sabotage activities are mostly aimed at our socialist construction and socialist transformation. For example, our country's policy of unified purchase and sale is beneficial to both the country and the people, and it is supported by the broad masses of peasants. However, it is not beneficial to the enemy. But after the unified purchase and sale in 1953, Newfan and Peng counties generally had an atmosphere of "complaining about food shortages," with more than 60% of the villages having different degrees of "complaining about food shortages." From the materials we investigated, we studied the causes of "complaining about food shortages," which were not due to too much purchase and too little supply. The main reason was the enemy's incitement and sabotage. It can be said that where there is serious food shortage, there is definitely a place where the enemy's sabotage is rampant. For example, in Longfeng Township, Banqu Village, Peng County, with 113 households and 585 people, the total production in 1953 was 360,894 jin, excluding 54,134 jin of public grain, there were still 300,676 jin of grain left. Excluding 53,730 jin of purchased grain, each person still had an average of 432 jin of grain. It should be supplied with 15,990 jin of grain, but 71,000 jin were actually supplied, with 55,000 jin more supplied. In addition to the supplied grain, each person actually had an average of 554 jin of grain. In theory, there should be no problem, but the "complaining about food shortages" was still very serious. The reason was that the hidden counter-revolutionary element Liu Zhi used small favors to demoralize the village head, the militia leader, and the production committee, threatening more than 100 people to besiege the township government and the township head to demand grain. Later, we arrested Liu Zhi, and the atmosphere of complaining about food shortages was finally calmed down.

Another example, as in the 4th village of Chongyi Township, Newfan County, the rich peasants, using the method of lending money and helping with work, demoralized the village representative and head Chen Futing (mutual aid group leader), and Chen gave the rich peasants a note to purchase grain and led the entire group members to eat in restaurants every day, signing a contract to eat in the restaurant, affecting more than 50% of the masses to complain about food. After his position was removed, the rich peasants immediately demanded the return of the debt. When we visited him, he expressed great regret and admitted his mistake to us.

Another example, as in the 11th village of Yihe Township, Peng County, the rich peasant Xiang Qingbao (a controlled person), instructed his henchman Zhou Jun to enter the village office as a clerk, bought the village head, and controlled the village political power. He gave the landlords and surplus grain households notes to purchase grain and arbitrarily detained various notices, hiding them and not letting the policies meet the masses, so that the village has never smoothly completed any key tasks. The village's purchase task in 1953 was more than 80,000 jin, but only more than 50,000 jin were completed. In 1954, after Zhou Jun was detained, the purchase task in 1954 was completed ahead of schedule.

From the above materials, it is very clear that the reason for the "complaining about food shortages" in various places is actually not due to a shortage of food, but rather a surplus of food. It is not the peasants who are complaining about food, but rather the counter-revolutionary elements and lawless landlords and rich peasants who are inciting the complaint about food. It is not the food supply that is tight, but rather a man-made tightness. Often, when a place appears to complain about food, after our cadres find out the truth and deal with a few lawless landlords, rich peasants, or counter-revolutionary elements, the people's hearts in that place immediately become stable, and the phenomenon of complaining about food also passes, and the tense atmosphere also passes. The facts are like this. However, some of us, without analyzing various rumors, hear the wind and think it's raining. As soon as they hear someone shouting "food shortage," they also join in the shouting: "Oh my, the peasants have no food to eat, it's terrible!" In fact, it is not that the peasants have no food to eat, but rather that the rich peasants have no more grain to hoard. Some people, without investigating the rural situation, also shout that "too much has been purchased, too little has been supplied, and the peasants lack food!" In fact, the purchase is not too much, and the supply is not too little. It is just that the grain is in the hands of the state, and the rich peasants and profiteers can no longer engage in speculative buying and selling. Some people still worry that the unified purchase and sale will "strike the peasants' enthusiasm for production." In fact, after the unified purchase and sale, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has only increased and has not been struck. It is the exploitative behavior of the rich peasants and profiteers that has been severely struck. All these irresponsible echoes of those rumors, those who follow the rumors and shout, think they are speaking "justice" for the peasants, but unknowingly become the megaphones of the rich peasants, profiteers, and counter-revolutionary elements; they think they sympathize with the peasants, but they do not know that they have been tricked by the counter-revolutionary elements, speaking words that go against the interests of the peasants and affect the alliance between workers and peasants. This is the result of being complacent and lacking understanding of the current class struggle. Therefore, I think that in the future, to understand rural work, first, we must comprehensively study various policies and understand what this policy is all about; second, we must definitely analyze various reflections concretely and understand from which class's interests those rumors originate, and be vigilant against the enemy's activities at all times; third, we must also investigate and study the actual situation and use facts to verify. Only in this way can we have the right to speak about rural work, only in this way can we enhance vigilance, only in this way can we distinguish the enemy. Now the facts have proven that the enemy will definitely come to sabotage our socialist construction and socialist transformation, and will definitely come to overthrow the people's democratic regime. If we do not enhance vigilance and adopt an attitude of familiar sight and indifference towards them, let them go, and be lenient with them, it is like raising a tiger to eat oneself, which will bring great disasters and losses to our people. Therefore, I think that the handling of counter-revolutionary elements in the future must be strict, and they must be arrested immediately when they are found, and killed immediately when they are found. They must be given a resolute and merciless blow.

Comrades, our first five-year plan is about to be passed. We are carrying out the great cause of building socialism under the condition of victory; our people's democratic dictatorship is very consolidated; we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and our strength is great. As long as we accept the party's education, understand the enemy's counter-revolutionary strategy, learn to distinguish various counter-revolutionary elements, insist on the powerful weapon of people's democratic dictatorship, we will definitely be able to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, smash all the conspiracies of domestic and foreign enemies, ensure the victory of the five-year plan, and protect our revolutionary fruits and socialist future.

As a member of the National People's Congress, I will definitely enhance my political vigilance in learning and work, constantly overcome my complacent and self-satisfied thoughts, and enthusiastically join the struggle against all counter-revolutionary elements, with such practice to support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to support the National People's Congress, and to support our great first five-year plan.

**Speech by Bangdaoji**

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and other reports.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, drafted and proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is in full compliance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully considers the actual situation of minority areas. Its complete implementation will advance the great cause of socialist construction in our great motherland; it will also be more conducive to the progress of various construction causes in minority areas and promote the improvement of the lives of various nationalities.

### 1955年4月23日第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议代表发言摘录

Title: Excerpts from Speeches by Delegates at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd

**Zai Shijun's Speech**

I am deeply moved by the reports of the various leaders and the discussions on the draft of the Five-Year Plan. I fully support the reports and the draft of the Five-Year Plan.

The construction of the Kangding-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet highways, under the personal care of Chairman Mao, has greatly facilitated the communication between the Changdu region and the rest of the country. The economic and cultural life of the people in Changdu has become closely linked with that of the rest of the country, various ethnic groups, and various national construction efforts. Over the past four years, the main construction effort in Changdu has been the building of the Kangding-Qinghai highway. In addition, with the help of the Central People's Government, various institutions such as health, animal epidemic prevention, trade, grain, banking, and postal services have been established. The government has implemented various measures to encourage production, such as lending seeds, distributing agricultural tools, assisting with local specialties, and providing industrial and commercial loans. Therefore, in implementing the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, which stipulates "developing Tibet's agriculture, livestock, industry, and commerce, and improving the people's living conditions," significant achievements have been made.

However, there have also been many shortcomings and errors in the work of the Changdu region. In economic construction, for example, the establishment of agricultural and livestock experimental stations, due to insufficient understanding of the region's social conditions and natural environment, mechanically applied experiences from other places, and rushed into large-scale projects from the beginning, resulting in little effect and waste. In basic construction projects, workers were hastily recruited at the beginning, work efficiency was low, and due to poor design and material supply issues, construction costs were high, resulting in waste. Although these issues have been corrected and are gradually being overcome, they have already caused losses to the state.

This year, after the publication of the National People's Congress Standing Committee's several decisions on work in Tibet, the people of all circles in our region have expressed enthusiastic support and are actively promoting their thorough implementation.

In the future, based on the actual situation of our region's work, we will strive to implement the spirit of "increasing production and practicing thrift" outlined in the First Five-Year Plan. We will further strengthen unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, raise the level of patriotism among the people, and do a good job in social security work. On this basis, we will gradually develop livestock and agricultural production as the central task of the entire region, correspondingly guide the development of commerce and handicrafts, promote cultural education and medical and health work, and according to actual needs and possibilities, build some small-scale industries. An important link in all work is to cultivate Tibetan political and technical cadres to create conditions for the future establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region and the development of the economic and cultural life of the Tibetan people.

I enthusiastically welcome the successful formulation of the great First Five-Year Plan and am willing to contribute all my strength to its full realization.

**Kui Shijuan's Speech**

I am a young female worker at the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Mill. At this meeting, I listened to the reports of various leaders and was deeply moved. I fully support these reports.

The draft of the Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which will be passed at this meeting, stipulates that the development of heavy industry should be the center. To develop heavy industry, a large amount of capital is needed. We textile workers must continuously improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce costs, and launch a labor competition centered on comprehensive savings to accumulate more funds for the construction of our motherland.

Over the past two years, after learning about the Party's general line for the transitional period, our confidence in building socialism has increased, and our enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. The workers in our group said: "Chairman Mao has given us a great plan to build socialism, and we must make our own small plans to ensure the realization of the great plan." "We cannot let one person not completing the plan affect the great plan."

In the two years of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, all workers in the factory have enthusiastically launched labor competitions and achieved remarkable results in production. Our factory reduced production costs by 0.8% compared to the plan in 1954 and exceeded the profit plan by 8.75%. In the first quarter of this year, the cost plan was reduced by 3.33%, and the profit exceeded the plan by 2.49%.

Our group formulates a feasible competition guarantee condition every month and implements it seriously. Under the leadership of the Party, we actively learn political and cultural knowledge and improve our technical level, organize production meetings, exchange experiences, and regularly conduct inspections, carry out criticism and self-criticism; at the same time, we strengthen mutual assistance in daily life, conduct home visits, and help each other overcome difficulties; so that all members of the group actively participate in production and complete the plan in an all-round way. For example, in 1954, our group's production exceeded the plan by more than 0.5%, the amount of lint on the roller was reduced by more than 16%, and the attendance rate reached 99.35%. Therefore, our group was selected as an advanced group of Shanghai City's industrial labor model in 1953 and 1954.

The biggest difficulty facing the textile industry at present is the shortage of raw materials. We textile workers understand that in socialist construction, saving one cotton flower and saving one inch of yarn can accumulate a large amount of funds for the state. Therefore, we strive to improve technology, improve technology, and save every cotton flower and every inch of yarn. Currently, our textile factory is using a batch of yellow cotton and peeled cotton, which is somewhat difficult in production, and we are fighting to overcome this difficulty. We have achieved some results. Here, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the farmer brothers for their hard work and efforts to increase production to support the textile industry, and I hope that the farmer brothers will continue to work hard to produce a large amount of cotton to support us. Let us work together to contribute greater efforts to the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

To ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the Five-Year Plan, we must overcome the complacency and conservatism. As Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in his report, although the cotton consumption in the Shanghai region is relatively low, there are still many shortcomings in our work, and the phenomenon of waste is still serious. For example, our factory's cotton consumption is higher than the most advanced factory. In the first quarter of this year, our factory used 385.52 jin of cotton per piece of 32-count yarn, while the No. 6 National Cotton Mill used 382.9 jin. We used 2.62 jin more per piece of yarn. If we make more efforts, we can further reduce our cotton consumption. In terms of electricity, machinery, and materials, some factories are better than us. We have not actively and purposefully led the reasonable suggestions of the workers. The production plan is satisfied with the achieved results, and the "topped out" mentality is fostered. In many workers, there is a lack of enthusiasm for learning and promoting advanced work methods. Some workers' labor discipline is still slack; the awareness of obeying national assignments is still very insufficient. We must strive to overcome these shortcomings in work and thought, and further tap potential.

The Five-Year Plan will bring greater happiness to the people of the whole country. Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our working conditions and material and cultural lives have been greatly improved. For example, before liberation, every time it was the rainy season or hot weather, workers had to work in the hot and stuffy workshop, and often someone would faint from the heat. Now, because the government has spent money to install ventilation and cooling equipment, the working conditions have been improved, and the temperature in the workshop during hot weather is only around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is cooler than outside, allowing us to work happily in a good environment. We know that all this is brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. At the same time, we must remember that every victory in our production is what the enemy hates. We must always be vigilant against the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements. The recent exposure of the counter-revolutionary crimes of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng is another great victory for the Party and the people. I fully support the Standing Committee's decision to arrest and try the two counter-revolutionary elements, Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. All of us workers will unite more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, contribute all our strength, and strive to complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan.

**Deng Chumin's Speech**

I sincerely support the various reports of our government leaders.

I would like to provide some opinions on the issue of "cultivating construction cadres" in Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report, in connection with the self-reform of intellectuals.

To build our motherland into a great socialist state, a large number of cadres are needed. Cultivating high-quality cadres is the responsibility of intellectuals and cultural workers. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, intellectuals have participated in socialist construction and have been welcomed by the people. However, to adapt to the needs of national construction and do a good job in cultivating cadres, intellectuals must continuously improve themselves in various aspects. Improving oneself is not something else, but continuously reforming oneself.

Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the self-reform of intellectuals can be roughly divided into three stages: this is the process of self-reform through various political movements, through various studies, and through the current scientific research and academic thought criticism. Expanding the reform from the political field to the academic thought field.

The Party's policy of uniting and reforming intellectuals has its definite basis and clear goals.

What is the basis for unity? In the past, it was the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and now it is the seven principles in the General Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. What is the goal of reform? This is: first, to clearly recognize the political direction of socialism in terms of ideology; second, to gradually establish a dialectical materialist worldview; third, to strive to cultivate communist moral qualities. These three are indispensable and inseparable conditions for cultivating all-round construction personnel and are also indispensable and inseparable conditions for the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan.

Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the self-reform of intellectuals has achieved results, especially through the recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we intellectuals have received a profound class struggle education, clearly recognizing that a series of political movement processes, various studies, criticisms, and struggle processes are the most effective self-reform processes for intellectuals.

At present, except for a few resolute counter-revolutionaries, most intellectuals are no longer a question of whether to accept reform, but a question of whether to connect themselves and carry out self-reform through each specific struggle. Our reform goal is to clearly recognize the political direction of socialism in terms of ideology. But verbally supporting the political direction of socialism does not mean actually supporting the various specific policies of socialism in action. Because the implementation and promotion of various specific policies of socialism will, to a certain extent, change the living habits of tens of millions of people (Li Fuquan's report). For example, the state's implementation of planned procurement and planned supply of grain and other major living materials has proven to be an important measure that is in line with the current and long-term interests of the people of the whole country, but in some people, it has caused false cries of grain shortage, and in some intellectuals, due to lack of investigation and analysis, consciously or unconsciously influenced by the thoughts of landlords and the bourgeoisie, followed the cry. Even for the policy of unified purchase and supply, for the state's other economic adjustments, for statistics and supervision, for the planned nature of socialist construction, they adopted a skeptical and opposing attitude. They exaggerated shortcomings and did not see that the general situation was good. Such people, although they verbally support the political direction of socialism, actually go against the political direction of socialism.

Next, our reform goal is to gradually establish a dialectical materialist worldview. But subjectively thinking that one has already established a dialectical materialist worldview does not mean that in actual action, the thought of idealism has been eliminated. It has been proven that the worldview of idealism is still dominating the lives, work, and struggles of many of us. Many intellectuals do not understand that the process of building socialism is the process of class struggle, do not understand that we are in the most acute and complex transitional period of class struggle, this is reflected in only caring about business, not asking about politics, not understanding the relationship between business and politics, not understanding the political significance of various events, not refuting rumors, not investigating, not studying, and even regarding the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements as natural accidents. The worldview of idealism is also reflected in only caring about subjectivity, not caring about objectivity; only seeing one side, not seeing the whole; only believing in oneself, not believing in the masses; thus producing non-political tendencies of being detached from reality, detached from the masses, and detached from class struggle. In fact, any error in work, if traced back to its worldview roots, is the bourgeois thought system core of idealism. In a word, if we do not understand that politics is class struggle, do not understand the objective law that class struggle penetrates economic, political, and ideological aspects, do not understand the objective law of social development, then people who verbally support dialectical materialism may not be people who have accepted socialist reform in terms of ideology and politics.

Again, our reform goal is to strive to cultivate communist moral qualities. But verbally advocating communist moral qualities does not mean that in actual action, one has communist moral qualities. For example, some teachers regard the responsibility of conducting communist moral education for young students as the responsibility of school administration, the Party, the Youth League, political courses, and political guidance offices, and has nothing to do with ordinary teachers. They think that the responsibility of teachers is to pass on knowledge to students and vulgarize teaching work and political tasks. Some teachers only propose various moral requirements to young students but do not consider that they should set an example for students' rationality, emotion, will, and other behaviors. In fact, communist morality is extremely urgent and strict for everyone today, and it is multifaceted. For example, loving the motherland, loving labor, loving science, protecting public property, observing revolutionary laws and regulations, etc. Because communist morality is derived from the class struggle of the proletariat and serves the interests of the communist cause. The communist cause is a great cause in the history of mankind, unprecedented in its greatness, it requires the class and people who undertake this great cause to have a firm stance, be brave and resolute, be self-sacrificing, and have a high degree of revolutionary discipline. In our representatives, two counter-revolutionary elements—Pan Hannian and Hu Feng—were exposed, they not only violated revolutionary laws and regulations but also went against ordinary human morality, which is unacceptable to revolutionary people. We should unanimously support the Standing Committee's report on the handling of the two counter-revolutionary elements, Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. It must be pointed out that if we intellectuals are serious about conducting communist moral education for ourselves and the younger generation, the whole problem is to make this education and every specific step of class struggle combined, not empty moral preaching. For the appearance of any counter-revolutionary elements, it should be analyzed at the height of class struggle principles and the law of class struggle, not from formal logic, occurring doubts and making various speculations. Otherwise, it only shows that one's political level is too low in subjectivity and violates the total requirements and total goals of communist morality in objectivity.

How should we intellectuals carry out self-reform under the leadership of the Communist Party of China? The key is to connect oneself, to be like an impartial judge, to judge oneself at every specific struggle. First, ask ourselves if we actually support the political direction of socialism in action when we verbally support the political direction of socialism; second, ask ourselves if we are not infiltrated and intoxicated by bourgeois idealism in objectivity when we subjectively demand to establish a dialectical materialist worldview; third, ask ourselves if we actually conform to communist morality in action when we verbally advocate communist morality. This is the key issue of our intellectuals' comprehensive reform in the transitional period and is also the key issue of the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan.

The process of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation is also a process of comprehensive reform for all the people of the country, intellectuals, and is a process of class struggle in a special form. I guarantee that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, I will not sleep in the fiery class struggle; in the process of socialist transformation, I will strive to reform myself; especially in this great era of Mao Zedong, which decides the fate of the country and future generations, I will contribute my blood and sweat.

**Che Xianqin's Speech**

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on "the development of the national economy's first five-year plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on "the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on "the draft of the conscription law of the People's Republic of China," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on "the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." After listening to the reports and discussing the draft of the Five-Year Plan, I deeply feel that the future of socialist society is within reach, and as a cultural worker, I feel that my responsibilities are both arduous and glorious. I will strive unremittingly at my post to realize the Five-Year Plan.

I work in Liaoning Province and would like to talk about the education work in Liaoning Province. The province has about 200,000 middle school students and 2.4 million primary school students. In recent years, the number of students has increased significantly, and the quality of teaching has also improved to a certain extent. However, from the perspective of cultivating a generation with all-round development for the socialist construction of the country, there are still problems in our education work. First of all, students' learning burden is too heavy, and their health is not good. According to what I know, the main reason for the heavy burden of middle school students is that they have too much homework outside of class. I asked three middle school students, and it is said that whether it is the mathematics teacher, physics teacher, or chemistry teacher, they all assign three or four problems for homework, and the problems assigned are not easy to solve. Therefore, many students cannot bear it. They get up early and stay up late, do not rest at noon, and do not rest on weekends, resulting in no weekends but only seven days a week. This serious phenomenon, although it is an old problem, has not been effectively corrected. Students in school can only memorize and recite, and some even lie in bed to recite. As a result, young students become nervous and even some get tuberculosis. We should follow the instructions of the Ministry of Education to reduce the heavy burden on middle and primary school students and make students study better.

Secondly, political education in middle schools is still weak. Some teachers still have the tendency of "managing but not guiding" and "teaching but not educating people," which means they are still influenced by the bad ideas of bourgeois education, or they are lazy and do not want to be bothered, thinking that it is better to have less trouble than more trouble, and have not established the sense of responsibility of a people's teacher. It must be known that in the transitional period, class struggle is extremely fierce, and the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie are constantly infiltrating the youth. Improving the moral character of students is not an easy task. Teachers who do not care about students are equivalent to letting them accept bad influences. Therefore, in some schools, some students have bad moral character, such as fighting, swearing, stealing, and not caring for public property, which have been discovered. If this is not corrected in the learning stage, they will not be able to become hardworking, law-abiding citizens who actively participate in socialist construction when they grow up. Of course, the majority of young students love their motherland, study hard, and are lively and lovable. Our task is not to be satisfied with this majority but to work actively and patiently to cultivate a new generation that can inherit the great cause of building the motherland.

Next, there is the issue of high school and junior high school graduates participating in labor production. This year, Liaoning Province has tens of thousands of high school graduates and tens of thousands of junior high school graduates. It is estimated that apart from those who will continue their studies, a large part of the high school and junior high school graduates will participate in labor production or organize self-study. Originally, a large number of young people with a certain level of cultural knowledge and enthusiasm for building the motherland participating in production is a big deal, and the purpose of our country's cultivation of young people is also to make them participate in the construction of the motherland sooner or later. Therefore, the vast majority of high school and junior high school graduates participating in production is a normal phenomenon, just like the majority of middle school graduates in the Soviet Union also participate in production. But from the situation over the past few years, it cannot be said that there are no problems. I think schools must strengthen their contact with parents and explain to the graduating students together that whether they continue their studies and participate in construction later or do not continue their studies and participate in construction now, as long as they actively and creatively work for the motherland, it is glorious. At the same time, I think that all levels of representatives of the People's Congress have the responsibility to change the remaining prejudice against labor in society and enthusiastically encourage young people to create the great future of the country and their own happiness with their own hands.

Finally, it is necessary to further play the exemplary role of people's teachers. I remember that a primary school had an old teacher who loved the school very much and cared about every blade of grass and every tree. One night, he thought in his sleep that there was a basket left in the courtyard of the school, and he got up to look for it but did not find it. He went back to bed but was still worried about the basket and could not sleep. When it was dawn, the students he had cultivated ran back to the school and told him: "I picked up the basket last night and put it away, afraid that it would be buried by the snow." This story seems very ordinary, but it vividly shows that a teacher who loves school property can educate students in the same way. This also shows that a teacher's every move and every word must be particularly careful and must set a good example for students. I sincerely hope that all primary and secondary school teachers in the country can set an example and cultivate all-round socialist construction personnel for our great motherland. I believe that under the inspiration of the great construction of the Five-Year Plan, we will definitely achieve greater results.

**Bo Qiwu's Speech**

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, I feel extremely excited. According to the first five-year plan, we will concentrate our main efforts on industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction, to lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country; develop part of the collective ownership of agricultural production cooperatives and develop handicraft production cooperatives, to lay the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; basically bring capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, to lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. I think this is a great plan, a plan that is initial but fundamentally changes the economic face of our country, a plan created by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao based on Marxist-Leninist theory combined with the specific situation of our country, a major step in building a socialist society in our country, and the common wish of all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, I sincerely and enthusiastically support it and am willing to exert my greatest efforts to complete this plan.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget points out that the 1954 national budget was realized under the premise of the gradual rise of our national economy. The execution of the budget has helped the development of the national economy. The main task of the 1955 national budget expenditure is to ensure the development of heavy industry according to the plan for the development of the national economy and to correspondingly develop light industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings. This shows that our national budget is a budget to ensure the realization of the national economic construction plan, a budget to create a happy life for the people, and I fully support it and suggest that the conference approve it.

Socialist industrialization is the central task of our country in the transitional period, and the central link of socialist industrialization is to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Because only with heavy industry can we produce modern industrial equipment; only with heavy industry can we create the material and technological conditions for the mechanization of agriculture; only with heavy industry can we continuously expand social production and improve people's lives; only with heavy industry can we further improve the equipment of our army and strengthen the national defense of our country; as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Therefore, we believe that the realization of socialist industrialization is the highest interest of the people of the whole country. Some people think that we have the help of brother countries and can first develop light industry or develop heavy industry and light industry equally to quickly improve the people's living standards. This view is wrong. Because we must never forget that we are still surrounded by vicious imperialism, if we do not carry out socialist industrialization and prioritize the development of heavy industry, we will not only be unable to build a socialist society in our country but also have the danger of being unable to resist the aggression of imperialism and unable to maintain economic and political independence. Of course, we will not even talk about improving or raising the people's living standards. We clearly understand that the higher the economic construction of the people, the more the domestic and foreign enemies will try to sabotage it in various ways. Therefore, the socialist construction of our country must be carried out under the protection of a solid national defense, and to establish a solid national defense, we must prioritize the development of heavy industry. Only by establishing a powerful heavy industry can we produce modern weapons to equip the warriors who defend our motherland, making our national defense more solid and peace more secure.

We are able to carry out planned socialist economic construction, which is hard-won. Looking back at the past hundred years, our country has suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, especially the twenty years of reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, who ruthlessly plundered the people, making the broad laboring people work hard all year round without a full meal. Only under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class—the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, after decades of arduous struggle, did the people of the whole country overthrow the reactionary rule and liberate the mainland. After only three years of economic recovery, in 1953, our country began the great first five-year plan of economic construction. The material and cultural lives of the people of the whole country have been continuously improved, and our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved, becoming a powerful pillar of peace in Asia and the world. It is truly heartfelt to thank the Communist Party of China and the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, for their wise leadership.

The smooth implementation of the first five-year plan is the glorious responsibility of workers on all fronts of industry and agriculture, and it is also the glorious responsibility of every soldier in the People's Liberation Army. We should be highly vigilant, keep an eye on the enemy, defend the national defense of our country, and defend the socialist construction of our country; at the same time, within the army, we must practice thrift, cherish weapons and ammunition, cherish equipment and materials, cherish horses, carts, and vehicles, cherish state property; strive to train, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve socialist awareness, improve military technology level, and build our army into a modern and excellent revolutionary army, ready to give a fatal blow to any enemy who dares to invade our country at any time.

At the same time, we know that our sacred territory of Taiwan is still under the protection of American imperialism and occupied by the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek. The eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still in a state of water and fire, and as long as Taiwan is not liberated, the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people is not completed; as long as Taiwan is not liberated, the national defense of our country is not secure; for the eight million compatriots in Taiwan, for the consolidation of the national defense of our country, for the defense of peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and definitely have the strength to liberate Taiwan.

**Ou Baichuan's Speech**

The draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China fully reflects the long-cherished wish of all ethnic groups in the country. With this plan and the guarantee of its implementation, we can lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country, smoothly carry out the cause of socialist transformation, and gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the people on the basis of developing production. The Five-Year Plan also, according to the specific different situations and conditions of various ethnic minority areas, stipulates the construction in the fields of industry, agriculture, railways, roads, health, and culture, which will promote the further development of the economy and culture of ethnic minority areas. I feel very excited. I fully agree with the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and I agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan and Li Xiannian. I have listened to the reports of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on the draft of the conscription law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of Yellow River water resources, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I fully support them.

Since the beginning of planned economic construction in 1953, the country has achieved great results in all aspects. To successfully complete the first five-year plan with socialist industrialization as the center, we must carry out arduous work in all aspects. From the situation in Guizhou, we must first concentrate our main efforts on improving agricultural production, actively develop agricultural production cooperatives, further carry out the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid, greatly increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, and actively support the socialist industrialization construction of the country. To ensure the grain supply for the construction of the five-year plan, in addition to greatly increasing grain production, we must continue to implement the policy of planned procurement and planned supply of grain. The two-year implementation of the state's grain unified purchase and supply policy and the "three fixed" measures is completely correct. Due to the implementation of this policy, the grain supply in urban and rural areas and the stability of market prices have been guaranteed, the enthusiasm of farmers for increasing production has been enhanced, the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation has been promoted, the socialist industrialization construction of the country has been supported, and the socialist construction and socialist transformation have been further consolidated, playing a great role. However, we have made mistakes in the implementation of the state's unified purchase and supply policy in the past. Some areas in Guizhou Province have paid more attention to unified purchase than to unified supply and have not done a good job in supply work in a timely manner. The propaganda of the policy is not deep and thorough, the situation of grain shortage is not investigated, and when the masses call for grain shortage, grain purchase vouchers are easily issued. The actual situation is that the vast majority of those who call for grain shortage are not really short of grain. For example, in Bijiang County, Fujian and Yangqing Towns, 440 households out of the 440 households that caused a stir over grain shortage were only 35 households, accounting for 8% of the households that called for grain shortage. After the implementation and thorough rectification of the "three fixed" measures, the propaganda and implementation of the grain supply work have been carried out, and the truly grain-short households have been supplied in a timely manner, and those who are not short of grain but cause a stir over grain shortage have been educated, resulting in not only the guarantee of supply but also a great reduction in the grain supply figures of 36,000 jin. After the rectification of the grain unified supply work, not only the supply is guaranteed and grain is saved, but also the enthusiasm of farmers for production is enhanced. For example, in Huangping County, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Miao ethnic area has developed greatly, and the number of households participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has reached 88.2% of the total number of households in the town. The masses' enthusiasm for production is high, and they are reclaiming wasteland, improving soil, building water conservancy projects, improving cultivation techniques, using improved agricultural tools, increasing fertilizer, and practicing bean planting on the edges of fields and melon planting on the edges of soil, ensuring the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task. The grain supply work in urban areas of Guizhou Province was previously too generous, the supply system was not strict, and the propaganda and education of saving grain were not deep enough, resulting in serious waste of grain in government agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, and urban residents. After the rectification, a large amount of grain can be saved. The waste in the ethnic minority areas of Guizhou Province is also very large. According to the statistics of a small town, in 1954, 42 cattle, 160 pigs, and 1,000 ducks were killed, 6,000 jin of rice was used to make wine, totaling 84,000 yuan, equivalent to 210,000 jin of rice; if calculated at 450 jin per person, it can supply the living expenses of 467 people for a year. The above situation fully shows that doing a good job in the unified purchase and supply of grain, rectifying the phenomenon of waste, not only can guarantee the supply of grain but also can save grain and accumulate funds. We must seriously overcome these shortcomings, implement the state's unified purchase and supply policy of grain, and ensure the smooth implementation of the five-year plan.

The thorough implementation of the Five-Year Plan is undoubtedly exciting for all ethnic groups in the country, but counter-revolutionary elements are not happy, and they will definitely sabotage the Five-Year Plan in various ways. From the current activities of counter-revolutionary elements, they are very rampant, and incidents of arson, robbery, murder, sabotage of production, and sabotage of central work occur frequently in cities and rural areas. According to the materials from five counties in Guizhou Province, including Guiyang, Xifeng, Luodian, and Huishui, on April 15 and 16, 180 households and 460 rooms were burned by counter-revolutionary elements, causing a loss of about 100,000 yuan, and 8 people were burned to death and 25 people were burned. Recently, in the ethnic minority areas of Taijiang County, Guizhou Province, there was also an incident of bandits robbing cooperatives and warehouses and killing district and township cadres, including three Miao cadres. These fully show that counter-revolutionary elements are the mortal enemies of our ethnic groups in building socialism. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution, decided to arrest and try the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, which is completely correct. In the past, our vigilance was not high, and there was a sense of complacency, and the masses had opinions, saying that we were too lenient with counter-revolutionary elements. We must see that the enemy will definitely use various despicable and shameless means to sabotage the Five-Year Plan, and we must be vigilant and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the successful implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

The thorough implementation of the Five-Year Plan is very arduous, and we must redouble our efforts to learn and work hard in all aspects to ensure its implementation. I believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Five-Year Plan of our country will definitely be successfully completed.

**Jin Baishan's Speech**

I sincerely support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the conference.

The greatest wish of all ethnic groups in the country is to build our country into a great socialist industrial power. The first five-year plan is a major step to realize this wish. It is a great plan that leads our country to advance along the socialist road and makes our country prosperous and strong and the people happy. It points out the specific methods for realizing this wish to all ethnic groups in the country, so all ethnic groups in the country enthusiastically support this plan. With this plan, the confidence and determination of all ethnic groups in the country to build the motherland, defend the motherland, and defend peace will be further enhanced.

I am a farmer from a collective farm. From my personal experience, we farmers can finally get rid of poverty and suffering only by leaving the old path of small-scale production that we have been accustomed to for a long time and turning to the new path of collective and mechanized socialist agriculture. Large-scale collectivization, especially mechanization of agriculture, is unimaginable without the development of state heavy industry. Therefore, the first five-year plan stipulates the policy of socialist industrialization with the development of heavy industry as the center, which is completely correct.

Our Xinghuo Collective Farm, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government and Chairman Mao, has developed from a four-household mutual aid group to a collective farm of 130 households in the direction of mutual aid and cooperation in recent years. After the organization, grain production has increased year by year; in the first year of the organization of the mutual aid group, that is, in 1948, we cultivated 120 mu of land, with an average of 15 mu per labor force, although we worked hard from dawn to dusk, the yield was slightly higher than that of individual farming, but the yield per mu was only 317 jin of rice. After two years of hard work, production has developed, and by 1951, the collective farm was organized, cultivating 1,425 mu of land, with an average of 31 mu per labor force, and a total of 844,455 jin of rice was harvested, with an average yield of 592 jin per mu. The yield in 1952 also increased, and in 1953, 3,000 mu of land was cultivated, with a total of 2,262,000 jin of rice harvested, with an average yield of 754 jin per mu. Last year, the entire farm of 121 households expanded the cultivated land to 6,300 mu, with an average of 37 mu per labor force, and although the disaster area reached 20%, the average yield was still 670 jin per mu, with a total of 4,221,000 jin of rice harvested, and 3,040,000 jin was sold to the state.

The main reason we can produce more grain is: after the organization, the potential of collective labor is brought into play, and according to each person's strengths in labor, rational division of labor is carried out, the quota management system is implemented, and the piecework system is implemented to avoid the phenomenon of idle labor and waste; horse-drawn agricultural tools and tractors are used for all dry sowing, chemical fertilizers are applied, and due to the reasonable irrigation of the tractor station and water pump station provided by the state, water is guaranteed in drought and water is drained in flood, thus increasing grain production.

With the development of production, our lives have also been gradually improved. In recent years, the income of the farm members has increased by more than three times, from 1.28 yuan per labor day in the mutual aid group to 5 yuan. The average annual income of male farm members is 1,350 yuan, with the highest reaching 1,825 yuan. Female farm members, in addition to household labor, have an average income of about 450 yuan, with the highest reaching 1,035 yuan. All school-age children in our village have been enrolled in school, and there are 6 senior high school students and 18 junior high school students. The village also has a farmers' evening school to learn culture and agricultural knowledge. There is also an amateur drama troupe. Since last year, 20 or more junior high school and primary school graduates have participated in the production of the farm and have become a powerful assistant in the production of the farm. They are not only enthusiastic about production but also active in various aspects of work and are very popular among people. Not only has the production of our Xinghuo Collective Farm developed so fast, and the life is so good, but the production and life of the other five collective farms nearby are also similar to ours. This fully shows the superiority of collectivization and mechanization.

Under the condition of continuously expanding reproduction and appropriately improving living conditions, we have accumulated 200,000 yuan of public accumulation funds for production. To give full play to the labor capacity of women, a nursery has been set up, with more than 100 infants entrusted, and actively creating conditions to reduce the burden of women's household chores, so that they can participate more in labor production.

Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in his report: "Developing agriculture is the basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan." In the implementation of the first five-year plan, the responsibility of farmers is heavy and glorious. The first five-year plan requires farmers to increase grain production by 17.6%. We, the Xinghuo Collective Farm, have the confidence and determination to ensure and overfulfill this glorious task together with all farmers in the country. To ensure and overfulfill this glorious task, we must correct the phenomenon that some farm members do not take good care of public property and some unreasonable phenomena in the current production quota management, improve the leadership level, strictly prevent the emergence of complacency, learn from the advanced experience of various places, take effective and practical measures to increase production in agriculture, improve the yield per unit area, expand the area of reclaimed land, give full play to the enthusiasm of farm members for labor production, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 4.6 million jin production task of our farm this year and sell 3.2 million jin of grain to the state to support the industrial construction of the state. We must also be 100 times more vigilant and resolutely prevent and eliminate the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and together with the people of the whole country, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, spare no effort, be modest and prudent, work hard, and strive to realize and strive to realize the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country as soon as possible!

**Han Wangchen's Speech**

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on "the development of the national economy's first five-year plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on "the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on "the draft of the conscription law of the People's Republic of China," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on "the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on "the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of Yellow River water resources," and I will resolutely implement them in my future work.

Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in his report: "Within five years, capitalist industry and commerce will be gradually brought into the orbit of state capitalism through various forms such as joint state-private enterprises, processing and contracting, and agency sales, laying the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce." This is completely correct, necessary, and possible. For example, in Xi'an, modern capitalist industry has basically entered the high-level form of state capitalism; the proportion of private industry and handicrafts accepting state processing and contracting in 1954 has reached 64.57% of their total output value; these enterprises, once they are jointly state-private, can gradually change the blindness and lack of government in capitalist management, and can improve management according to the state plan and the needs of the people, continuously improve production, and truly benefit the national economy and the people. For example, the Da Hua Textile Mill in Xi'an has gradually changed its original capitalist management methods after the joint state-private enterprise, and the enthusiasm of workers for production has generally increased; the percentage of finished products has increased from 86.7% before the joint state-private enterprise to 97.7%; the unit cost of 21-count yarn has been reduced by 20.85%; and it can now fully complete the state plan every month, and the profit has also increased compared to before. In the commercial sector: in 1954, 67.37% of the wholesale merchants in Xi'an have undergone guidance and transformation, and the number of private retailers who have carried out agency sales and sales for state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises has been increasing, so the business has undergone great changes and the sales volume has increased significantly. For example, the sales volume of the food and drug industry in Weinan has increased by more than 36% after the implementation of agency sales, and the sales volume of traditional Chinese medicine has increased by more than 42%. This has reversed their long-held misconception that there is a way for industry but not for commerce and a way for large-scale but not for small-scale. At the same time, the employees and real jobholders of the business who cannot continue to operate have been properly arranged, giving them an outlet. In the past year, more than 95% of the 4,900 shop assistants and real jobholders of the business who needed to be arranged in Xi'an have been actively and responsibly arranged by the relevant departments in accordance with the policy, law, and the principle of self-will; some real jobholders of the business with high abilities and good performance have taken on important positions; others are still in training and continue to be arranged. This is another profound education for the businessmen. Therefore, many people have reflected: "Now I am not panicked, and I will not bump into things blindly. The worries that I have no capital to walk towards socialism have been dispelled." And they all feel that as long as they sincerely accept socialist transformation, there will definitely be a way to go, and they can walk towards a socialist society.

But in the process of transformation, private industry and commerce will still have new worries. A few backward elements may resist and sabotage the transformation. In fact, in the current arrangement of transformation, there are still some businessmen who do not understand the importance of the arrangement of transformation, mistakenly thinking that the general line has closed the door and cannot go through. Even in the enterprises with better results of joint state-private enterprises, there are still a few capitalists or their agents who are satisfied with the current achievements, only compare with the backward situation of private enterprises, and rarely compare with the advanced enterprises. As for the phenomena of withdrawing capital, squandering, wasting, and speculating, they still occur from time to time; the phenomenon of tax evasion is also quite serious. In 1954, Xi'an uncovered 8,799 cases of tax evasion, totaling more than 140 million yuan. This shows that the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a long-term, detailed process of education and a complex and acute process of struggle. It is necessary to continuously carry out education and struggle to gradually complete the work of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

The existence and occurrence of the above-mentioned many problems are inseparable from the shortcomings and errors in our work, and we must strive to overcome and correct them in the future. We, the staff of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, must realize that our responsibilities are heavy, and we must actively cooperate with and assist the government in publicizing the state's policies, laws, and regulations and the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, deeply understand and analyze the opinions and demands of the business community, help them overcome difficulties, and actively carry out the transformation; we must especially mobilize law-abiding businessmen to resolutely fight against all illegal acts of resisting and sabotaging socialist transformation. We also hope that all private industry and commerce will see the bright future of socialism, sincerely accept socialist transformation; they must realize that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important part of our country's first five-year plan and is also our glorious task. We should be full of confidence and continue to work hard to complete this task.

Finally, it should be pointed out that while carrying out construction, all patriotic private industrialists and businessmen must continue to be vigilant and prevent the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, especially those hidden in the industrial and commercial circles, and resolutely resist the elements that resist socialist transformation. The recent Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident is a profound lesson. I suggest that the government firmly suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

We believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, any difficulty cannot shake our confidence, and any enemy cannot destroy our just cause. Let us follow the instructions of Chairman Mao, be honest and hardworking, encourage and help each other, and be vigilant against any boasting and arrogance, and strive to realize the first five-year plan that will make our country prosperous and happy!

**Tong Dizhou's Speech**

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China is about to be passed at this conference, which is a very important event in our great socialist construction. The implementation of the Five-Year Plan will begin to change the backward economic face of our country for a hundred years and lay the initial foundation for socialist construction. In the struggle to implement the Five-Year Plan, every person, regardless of their position, should strive to complete and overfulfill their work tasks. As a high-level educator and scientific researcher, I think that in the current situation, to better complete the tasks of cultivating construction cadres and strengthening scientific research work in the fifth chapter of our Five-Year Plan, we should pay attention to the following issues:

First, the formulation of the teaching plan. Since liberation, after the restoration and rectification of higher education and the ideological reform movement of teachers, we have entered the stage of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, reforming the education system, adjusting the departments, and formulating the teaching plan. The formulation of the teaching plan is most important to be in line with the actual situation of our country. Therefore, before formulating the teaching plan, we must conduct on-site investigations, collect relevant specific data on teaching, analyze and organize, refer to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and make a feasible plan, and then discuss and revise it after multiple discussions, and then implement it initially. If we ignore the current specific situation or have not conducted a detailed and comprehensive discussion, it is easy to deviate from reality, and such a teaching plan will encounter many difficulties in the process of implementation. At that time, if we consider revising it, we will inevitably cause great damage to the teaching work. Of course, the formulation of the teaching plan cannot be perfect at once, but it should not be changed too much. Because each university must go through a series of preparation processes to execute and implement a new teaching plan, such as the repeated learning and discussion of the teaching plan content by all teachers, the change of courses, the adjustment of teachers, the revision of teaching outlines, and the revision of textbooks, etc. Therefore, a change in the teaching plan in specific work must have a preparation time of one or two years to be basically ready. If it is changed too much, it will inevitably cause a chaotic phenomenon in teaching, which not only cannot improve the quality of teaching but also makes it difficult to maintain the normal teaching work. Therefore, the formulation of the teaching plan must be carefully considered and discussed to ensure that it is in line with reality.

Second, the cooperation between educational units, enterprise units, and scientific research units. At present, the number and quality of our teachers and scientific researchers are not enough to meet our needs. To complete the work tasks of our units and compete for teachers and scientific and technological personnel, it has become a common phenomenon among all units. To solve this problem, cultivating new cadres is the most basic method, but the close cooperation among the work of various units is also an important link to solve the shortage of cadres and ensure the completion of work. In terms of scientific research work, if only a few thousand people in scientific research institutions are responsible for this arduous task, the ability and effectiveness are limited. There are currently 38,000 full-time teachers in all universities in the country, and adding the professional personnel in factories and mines, the number is considerable. If we can organize them well, expand the team of scientific research work, cooperate with national construction, and carry out research work in a planned way, this will definitely have a great impact on the development of science in China. On the other hand, the specialized personnel in various research institutions and factory and mining departments are all outstanding scientific workers in the country. If they can undertake part of the teaching work, not only can they solve many of the problems of opening courses in universities but also can make the course content better combined with reality, assist various schools in improving the quality of education. Teaching and research are originally an inseparable whole. We hope that the Ministry of Higher Education, scientific research institutions, and relevant enterprise departments will jointly discuss and formulate a specific cooperation method, which is very necessary and urgent.

Third, the issue of saving time. Regarding the issue of saving, Vice Premier Li Fuquan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian have detailed explanations in their reports, and the small group meetings have also conducted in-depth discussions. But what is generally paid attention to is the saving of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and the saving of time is paid less attention to. In fact, time is also an important factor in all work, and the progress and achievements of any work cannot be estimated without time. In terms of scientific research work, all discoveries and inventions are not like "picking gold" that happen by chance and are obtained by chance. They are the result of years of research and gradually grow in the accumulation of materials and time. Teaching work is the same. A person engaged in teaching work, if he does not have time to read books, how can he complete his teaching tasks and improve his teaching quality? This is not to say that those engaged in teaching work and scientific research work should bury themselves in their business and not care about politics and the construction of the state, but on the contrary, they must actively participate in certain social and political movements to improve their political and ideological level. But if the activities or other affairs are too much, it affects his basic tasks, that is not appropriate. Therefore, I think that at present, those engaged in teaching work and scientific research work should have the following three requirements in the period of socialist construction and socialist transformation: (1) to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism to lay the ideological and theoretical foundation; (2) to participate in social and political movements appropriately to improve political awareness; (3) to have sufficient time to engage in their professional work. Regarding the issue of time, it has been raised by several representatives at the first session of the First National People's Congress last year. But the specific situation seems to have not changed much in a year, we hope that the responsible personnel of all parties will pay attention to this issue, so that the saving of time, in the movement of practicing thrift, can be fully developed together with the saving of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

**Zhang Haning's Speech**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of Yellow River water resources. I would like to express some opinions on the issue of treating the Yellow River.

The treatment of the Yellow River is an ideal pursued by our ancestors for thousands of years and the urgent hope of the 600 million people of the whole country. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the work of treating the Yellow River is about to begin, which is another major event in our country's economic construction. It will fundamentally change the natural face of the Yellow River Basin and create favorable conditions for our country to advance towards a socialist society and a communist society.

The Yellow River Basin is the cradle of ancient economy and culture in our country; it has fertile soil, which was highly praised in the book "Yugong" thousands of years ago; it has abundant water resources, and the area above Lanzhou accounts for only one-third of the total area, but the annual water flow accounts for seven-tenths of the total inflow; it has a magnificent situation, originating from a high source of more than 4,000 meters, flowing through mountains, and the valleys along the river have excellent terrain and geological conditions for building reservoirs; it is the location of the capital of successive dynasties before the Song Dynasty; it is sung by poets and singers of all dynasties. However, due to the unfavorable natural conditions of the Yellow River and the indifference of the reactionary ruling class to the people's lives, not caring about the management, and even destroying water conservancy, the Yellow River has often caused disasters in the past. In the past 3,000 years, there have been 1,500 records of the Yellow River breaking its banks and flooding in the lower reaches, and it has changed its course 26 times. Therefore, the Yellow River has been given the bad name of "a spendthrift."

The broad masses of the people in the Yellow River Basin have enriched their experience in treating the river through their tenacious struggle against floods and created many excellent methods of treating the river, ensuring agricultural production. However, this anti-disaster work is only limited to the lower reaches of the great plain and can only defend against the situation that has already become a disaster, so the Yellow River has not been fundamentally treated. Now the treatment plan starts from the root, not only to change the unfavorable natural conditions of the Yellow River but also to develop its resources to serve the people, not only to eliminate the threat of water disasters but also to fully utilize water and land according to the national economic development plan. This plan has completely changed our understanding of the Yellow River from "harm" to "benefit." At the same time, in terms of treatment methods, it unifies the treatment of "eliminating harm" and "benefiting," solving the past controversy of who comes first.

In terms of benefiting, the requirements for water use are also inconsistent. For example, there is a contradiction between water power utilization and irrigation of farmland. Water power utilization does not consume water, and after the water flows through the upstream power station, except for the loss of evaporation and seepage, it can still be used in the downstream power station and can be used level by level to the sea. However, irrigation consumes water, and after the water enters the field, it basically does not return to the river. It can be seen that to generate more electricity, irrigation must be correspondingly reduced, and to irrigate more, electricity generation must be reduced. Even in terms of irrigation water use, there is also a contradiction between upstream and downstream. If the upstream irrigation area is large, the downstream irrigation area must be correspondingly reduced, and vice versa. This is just two examples, and there are still other contradictions. These contradictions cannot be solved in a feudal society and a capitalist society, but in the Yellow River treatment plan, they have all been correctly solved.

Now, based on the technical possibility and economic rationality, the requirements of all aspects have been properly arranged. Because only on the basis of the superior system of people's democratic dictatorship can the maximum effect of technology be brought into play, the natural conditions can be most perfectly utilized, and the economic plan can guide the development and transformation of the national economy, making the productive forces continuously improve, improve the material and cultural lives of the people, consolidate the independence and security of the state.

This plan not only paints a beautiful future for us but also, based on the overall plan and the urgent needs of the present, arranges the first phase of the project. The first phase of the project is the first step of the comprehensive development of the Yellow River. After this resolution is passed, the blueprint will become a reality, and the water and land resources of the Yellow River Basin will serve the people in various aspects of economic construction, which is an exciting and thrilling event!

Some engineers in capitalist countries even arrogantly say that the Yellow River Basin will become a desert in two thousand years, which is completely slanderous and does not understand the power of the people. We will not only prevent it from becoming a desert but also make the Yellow River clear, make the Loess Plateau a lush forest and a fertile farmland, the Yellow River will never have water disasters, and the Yellow River will bring us a large amount of cheap electricity, promote industrial development, irrigate hundreds of millions of acres of farmland, increase agricultural production, open thousands of miles of waterways, and facilitate the transportation of ships. The Yellow River Basin will become a place of good weather, beautiful and rich. Now is the beginning of this great transformation of nature!

I have been engaged in research and investigation work on the Yellow River for exactly thirty years since I first went to the Yellow River. I have walked in many places on the Yellow River and written many articles about the Yellow River. I have longed for the beginning of the treatment of the Yellow River. However, in the dark days of reactionary rule, this was just a fantasy. Only after the victory of the people's revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, when the people became the masters of the state, could we formulate economic plans to improve the lives of the people and gradually build a prosperous and happy socialist society. I firmly respond to Vice Premier Li Fuquan's call and strive to realize the tasks of the first five-year plan in the transitional period and the tasks of the first five-year plan!

**Sha Ding's Speech**

I sincerely support our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. In the small group discussion, I was very excited because I felt more deeply that "we are doing the extremely glorious and great work that our ancestors have never done."

Now I would like to talk to the conference about the issue of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. First of all, it should be pointed out that after the first batch of materials exposing this counter-revolutionary group was published in the People's Daily, the people of all circles in Sichuan were very angry. The Sichuan Provincial People's Committee immediately convened an expanded meeting and unanimously decided to revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a member of the National People's Congress and requested the government to severely punish him according to law. At the same time, everyone began to widely expose and further understand the evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Sichuan before and after liberation.

During the Anti-Japanese War, as the secret army of the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary party led by Chiang Kai-shek, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group did a lot of sabotage against the revolution. They were responsible for the counter-revolutionary tasks of the Kuomintang in the ideological field. The various publications they published in Sichuan were always aimed at the Communist Party of China, the people, and all progressive forces, and they used various covert sabotage methods to serve Chiang Kai-shek and even achieved the counter-revolutionary goals that Chiang Kai-shek could not achieve with open counter-revolutionary means. For example, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not allow writers to satirize and expose their reactionary government's corruption and darkness, but Hu Feng cursed and satirized writers who satirized and exposed the dark rule of the reactionaries as "stirring up manure." When the reactionaries' ban could not stop the spread of satirical and expository works, Hu Feng attacked these works. In this way, the literary and artistic circles and the thoughts of intellectuals were in chaos for a long time, suffering great losses. More despicably, they have always "struggled" with the Communist Party and the revolution to "win over" young people, recruiting soldiers for the reactionaries. At that time, many young people, yearning for light and revolution, risked their lives to go to Yan'an, and Chiang Kai-shek specially built a concentration camp in Xi'an to detain them. The members of the Hu Feng group, however, spread the reactionary theory that "there is life there, there is struggle there," causing many young people to give up their plans to go to Yan'an. People are right, the publications of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are another concentration camp built by Chiang Kai-shek.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries' behavior of launching a civil war to betray the country was opposed by the people of the whole country, and all their counter-revolutionary clamor was despised by the people of the whole country. At this time, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published many publications to cheer for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary cause. Therefore, during the War of Liberation, the publications of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Sichuan, such as "Breathing," "Pulse," "Strike," "Wild Chicken Collection," and "Comet Business," were more frantic in their attacks on the revolutionary movement and literary movement led by the Communist Party than ever before. For example, in 1947, which was the eve of the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, the people of the whole country, especially young students, rose up to fight against "hunger, war, and persecution" and welcomed liberation. However, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, in response to this struggle, advocated that "for us ordinary people to go to revolution, I must first think, am I not able to live if I do not go to revolution? If it is not so, I will not go to mourn for others!" They advocated that "one must endure all the sufferings of hunger, cold, disease, danger, exile, and death," preventing people from participating in the struggle against the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. When these reactionary propaganda could not stop people from participating in the struggle against the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, they even frantically used two-faced methods, using the hatred of the broad masses of young people towards the Kuomintang and the Three Principles Youth League, shamelessly slandering the then Communist Party-led magnificent student movement as a "petition march" of a few overly enthusiastic young people under the deception of the Three Principles Youth League's thugs, directly carrying out sabotage.

According to the materials exposed and controlled by many young people in Chongqing and Chengdu, Sichuan, the poisoning of young people by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is very serious. They always try every means to approach young people, especially those who love literature and art, to expand their "mass base." Just in Chengdu, from 1940 to the end of 1949, there were more than 15 literary and art groups organized by them, as well as those originally composed of progressive young people, which were infiltrated and controlled by them after they wormed their way in and influenced. In addition, they also organized many "reading groups" and "get-togethers" to poison young people. They used the dissatisfaction of young people with the then situation to vigorously advocate "subjective fighting spirit" and "primitive life force," deliberately making some naive and ignorant young people vent their individualism. As a result, all the young people who were poisoned by them became arrogant and great, hating the collective, and some were even dragged into the counter-revolutionary swamp! Luo Luo, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, is a "representative figure" cultivated in this way by them.

After liberation, we knew that the Hu Feng elements all left Sichuan, which made us misjudge in the early stages of the movement, thinking that there were no Hu Feng elements in Sichuan. The facts proved otherwise. Because the Hu Feng elements had already infiltrated various aspects of the revolutionary ranks, but they were not necessarily famous figures. Take the Hu Feng element Feng Yi, for example, he was just an ordinary worker in the materials room of a drama troupe, and the literary and art circles did not pay much attention to him, but he had carried out a lot of sabotage activities in the literary and art circles of Chongqing. First of all, he colluded with some people with ideological and political problems within the Sichuan People's Art Theater to form a small clique, stirring up trouble and trying to collapse the orchestra of the theater; at the same time, he also contacted a group of unemployed students outside the troupe, who consistently slandered and sabotaged the prestige of the Communist Party and the people's government. Therefore, Hu Feng valued him very much and often wrote letters to him personally to issue orders, using him as a "contact person" and a "person to win over." This shows that the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are truly pervasive. The facts have proven that in 1951, when Hu Feng came to Sichuan to participate in the land reform, he not only publicly propagated his reactionary thoughts but also did a lot of "contacting people" and "winning people over."

It should be said that the struggle to purge the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Sichuan is very intense. The broad masses who enthusiastically support the Communist Party of China and the socialist cause have all actively participated in this struggle. On the other hand, many counter-revolutionary elements and those who are dissatisfied with the current socialist construction and socialist transformation have carried out various sabotage activities against this struggle. For example, at a meeting to denounce Hu Feng in a grassroots unit of the industrial system in Chongqing, a hidden agent of the Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau, Zhang Wen, dared to stand up and defend Hu Feng and shouted and disrupted the meeting. This also shows that as a counter-revolutionary group, the Hu Feng group of bandits is a fully representative one.

In this thrilling struggle, the broad cadres and masses of Sichuan have received profound education, enhanced their understanding of the increasingly acute and complex class struggle in the transitional period, and clarified the use of two-faced methods as the characteristic of hidden enemies, which are more dangerous than openly armed enemies! To safeguard the victory of the socialist cause, everyone unanimously requested the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government to put forward a very serious demand: severely punish Hu Feng and his key members! Put all hidden counter-revolutionary elements out of the people!

**Wang Yanan's Speech**

Please allow me to express some thoughts on our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy.

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report, we have also carefully studied and discussed the draft of this plan; like other representatives, I am extremely excited and inspired to feel that this is another important document of decisive significance to the political life, economic life, and cultural life of the people of the whole country after the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" was passed at last year's conference. As a representative of the National People's Congress, what should I say about this document? I am a researcher in economics, what are my opinions on this great plan for the development of the national economy? At the same time, I am also an administrative responsible person of a university, how will I carry out my work according to this plan?

I would like to talk about these aspects.

First of all, as a representative of the National People's Congress, I enthusiastically support this plan. This is because the purpose that this plan aims to achieve is completely in line with the wishes of the people of the whole country. There is no Chinese person who does not eagerly expect the country to be strong and prosperous and hope to live a better life. And all the measures taken to transform our small peasant country into a socialist industrial country are precisely to meet the wishes of the people of the whole country. The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy not only clearly stipulates the requirement to gradually improve productivity year by year but also clearly stipulates the requirement to gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people year by year. Perhaps it can be said that in the process of implementing the plan, we have many difficulties: our past economy was too backward, the technological level was too low, and the accumulation was too little; our social economy still has many contradictions: in the national economy, capitalist economy still occupies a considerable proportion, and in agricultural economy, small peasant economy still occupies a great advantage. All these difficulties and contradictions need to be gradually overcome in the process of development, and we need to pay some price for the long-term benefits. We Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have experienced many hardships and sacrifices, and have won the peaceful, democratic, independent, and free life of today, and we will definitely work harder, sweat more, and pay a certain price to realize the Five-Year Plan and strive for a better tomorrow.

Therefore, as a representative of the National People's Congress, I firmly support this plan, which embodies the wishes and demands of the people of the whole country for the development of the national economy.

Next, as an economic science researcher, I regard this plan as a scientific model of Marxism. It is formulated under the guidance of the principle of historical materialism, grasping and applying the laws of Marxist political economy, especially the law of planned and proportional development in the transitional period. The preface explains the reliable political and economic historical basis on which the plan is established and the guiding principles on which the plan is implemented. Chapter 1 proposes the programmatic tasks that the Five-Year Plan aims to achieve, and Chapter 2, based on the tasks to be striven for, drafts the investment limits and production indicators of various aspects such as production, transportation, and commodity circulation, while Chapters 3 to 11 respectively stipulate the specific tasks of various aspects such as industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, education and culture, people's livelihood and welfare, and practicing thrift and opposing waste, correctly estimating the favorable and unfavorable conditions for achieving the tasks, and pointing out the necessary measures to be taken. The plan is vast and comprehensive, constituting a Chinese social and economic encyclopedia, but it is scientific and systematic. According to the strict logical order of the mutual connection and development of economic reality movements, it grasps and applies the role of various economic laws in the transitional period, especially the law of planned and proportional development, and systematically organizes various aspects, various steps, and various links into a comprehensive and balanced whole. The persuasiveness and correctness of the plan are precisely because it does not contain a bit of fantasy and is completely established on reliable facts and solid scientific evidence.

This plan itself and Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the plan will not only have a great guiding role in the field of Chinese economics but will also, like the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, become an important document to inspire the people of the whole country and improve the ideological level of the people of the whole country.

Finally, as an administrative responsible person of a university, I think that the inspirational and educational power of this plan should be a great driving force for our work. I work in Xiamen, a national defense front line in the southeast, and in the constant struggle against the enemy, I feel the importance of political and ideological education work more keenly. We often take the great achievements in various struggles of the state and the heroic examples of our broad masses showing tenacious and selfless patriotism on various fronts to inspire and encourage all our teachers, staff, and students. But despite this, the overall atmosphere of our school still lacks a sense of war, lacks a sustained fighting spirit, and the complacent mentality and low vigilance are still the major shortcomings of our work. This makes our thoughts still lag behind the requirements of reality. Since liberation, the Communist Party and the people's government have, in order to meet the urgent need to cultivate national construction personnel, strongly supported the improvement of the educational environment of schools and the enrichment of teaching and research equipment. The original founder of our school, Mr. Chen Jiageng, also assisted in the construction of many new buildings. However, as a Soviet expert pointed out after visiting some of our colleges and universities, our "equipment is better than technology, and technology is better than ideology"; in other words, ideology lags behind technology, and technology lags behind equipment conditions. On the one hand, this shows that there is a great waste of manpower and material resources in colleges and universities, and on the other hand, it shows that non-socialist and bourgeois ideas and methods of thinking are still having a powerful influence. In such an educational atmosphere, it is difficult to cultivate cadres who meet the requirements of socialist construction. We, the administrative workers of the university, must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in the nationwide movement to expose all counter-revolutionary elements, examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in ourselves and our work, to demonstrate that we are seriously striving to realize the Five-Year Plan.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    张难先代表的发言
    我听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理及彭真副委员长的报告，我是十分同意和竭诚拥护的。我们这个五年计划，中国共产党在一九五一年就胸有成竹的，在一九五三年就开始实施，至今两年才把这个计划拿出来，却是这两年的成绩，对于这个计划所包括的前两年计划超额成完的是很多，必须经过这个实验才拿出来，这种谨慎精审、伟大英勇的作风，实足以使全国人兴奋鼓舞，都相信这个五年计划可超额完成和如期完成。这个五年计划，就是三个五年计划的基础，这个基础稳固了，那末三个五年计划当然是可以顺利完成的。我谨向我们六万万人民致贺，并向我们六万万人民的后代致贺。
    我上月是在武汉市视察的，当时粮食问题极其严重，市民叫得厉害之极，我就注意这个问题，调查了好多事例，我就感觉到并不是粮食少了，也不是配粮的人配少了，除供应上其他问题外，实在是从习惯不正规的食量上发生的问题。我国向来每个人的食量并无正确计量，连自己也没个准的，只凭个人习惯，由他说他自己饱了，就以他这个饱作为标准的，这个标准就可以说是一笔糊涂账，那就是各个人的食量各人说法不同，质言之，就是千个人就是一千个样子，万个人就是一万个样子，像这个情况，你说他每天每人只吃得一斤，他说他非吃两三斤不饱，这个胡扯的食量标准，那就无论何人去办都难免于乱叫失措了。
    我就从武汉事例，粮食不少与配粮极多的问题说起，我起初总是疑心粮食少了，不够分配，由少发而发生叫嚣，后乃知道市人民委员会是采取宽打窄用的办法，配米都配得很宽，去年本已配得极宽，今年是以去年四月至九月半年的统计再核定的，我就是依据这个核定去查的。我查得汉口江岸区昌年里十五号夏莲荣全家六口人，核定每月一百一十四斤，他说吃不了这多，他每月退了十九斤；又如武昌文明路九十八号罗树春家，已配定后，他的妇人说多了，自动退了四十四斤；又有民主路五百二十八号张澈生家，我去调查，据云：他家大小十口，去年是发的三百斤，今年核减为一百五十斤，我问核减后够否，他说还差不多（去年他一家就多发了一百多斤，这还发得不宽么）。我说你去年就几几乎多购一半，你当时何以不退些呢？他说：去年大水后被灾亲友每天总有上十人在我家吃饭，不是发这多米我几几乎不得了，今年灾亲都回家生产去了，所以我就少要了些。像这些事例很多，我不多举，即此我们就可以证明粮多和配备得多了。配备得多，市民当然不叫哪；却是不然，请看我下面几个材料：
      一、汉口江岸区昌年里卞昌侯家，二大口二小口共四人，核定为每月为八十八斤，吵不够吃、差一半、饿死人，经过工作人员与他家过细一算，却只要八十斤，结果还减去了八斤。
    二、江汉路一百九十九号涂秀清共三口，核定为七十五斤，秀清吵不够，经街办事处检查发现，他家还存有每月多领的余粮共三百七十七斤，并有
  一部分发了霉。
    三、礄口区长堤街四百四十一号徐天顺家共三口，核为七十八斤，吵不够吃，经查卫生发现他家中还存二百八十八斤。
    四、这家吵得真奇，解放大道二十六号张鸦头，乱叫不够吃，经查他家只他一人核为一百六十斤，他每日就有五斤多粮，一人怎配五斤多粮呢？经查是填证员写错了，他一人几几乎领了十个人的粮，粮证，他看也未看，人叫、他也叫起来。
    我们把这些事例一看，可归纳为几种叫的原因：
    一、对政府信心不足，怕政府一旦缺粮挨饿，他凶一点叫，多搞些以备不虞，如卞昌侯、涂秀清两例是。
    二、政府配粮无真确的标准，钻空子的多搞些了去走私，这类经省市当局报告不少。
    三、美蒋特务借这个市民的叫嚣机会，暗中捣鬼，这例曾经省市公安同志报告过。
    四、无所谓的人看见别人叫可以多搞一点，他也叫一下多搞一点，这类的却不少。
    五、毫不摸底，看见人叫他也叫，如张鸦头是。
    以上这些事例，都是值得我们十分注意的。
      一、是关系人民的生活；
    二、是关系社会的治安；
    三、这个无正规化的食量标准，其浪费的数字，就不等于多煮几碗饭糟了，淘米滴了几粒。
    总之，这些事例归根结底都是无有一个正规化的适合的定量所致，这个底非摸不行，要摸这个底，我看只有请教于科学先生。
    所以，我此次提了一个案，大意是要请政府延聘营养学、生理学专家会同有关部门研究各类典型的正规食量的科学标准，凡写在提案上的，我也不必说，我今日的发言只就我的提案加以补充。
    我提案中要专家会同有关部门的意思是觉得我国解放仅仅六、七年，物质条件不够是可想像的，若由不了解实际情况的专家开一个欧美式的单来，我们主管部门倘若供应不来，那你天花乱坠的计划不成了一纸空文吗？所以必须根据科学的原理结合有关部门的事实精细计算支配，那才能不脱离实际而有良好的结果。
    总之，今日所重要的是要得到几个分类的正规食量。几个分类的正规食量得到了，较之乱七八糟，每个人一种食量（六万万人那就是六万万个食量）那就容易掌握多了。我这个意思，并不是像旧日的守财奴刻薄人的饮食，不许人吃饱，是要个个人都吃到必须的饱，而不是饱后还多吃一些来害自己而又糟蹋粮食，是要真真做到我们现今吃饱不浪费的口号。
    末了，我还有几句话要声明，我前所说的那些话，不包括武汉及我见闻以外的其他各方面，譬如前说的张鸦头事，工作人员既可把他的粮证误写多发一百几十斤，又谁能保证他不把人多的户误写少发一百几十斤呢？如有此事，那一家人就要挨饿啰，或者还有其他原因少发的，我怎能说每个人都发得多呢？总之我视察的时间短，见闻少，定多挂一漏万之处，敬祈各代表原谅和指教。
    邵力子代表的发言
    我听取了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，和李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，阅读了有关文件，感到万分鼓舞。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是我国制定宪法以后第一个有历史意义的重要文件。这个计划是以宪法序言里规定的国家在过渡时期的总任务为基本任务的；第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过宪法时，已有共同的认识：我国建设社会主义的事业，应以社会主义工业化为主体，以农业、手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造为必要组成部分，而社会主义工业化又以优先发展重工业为中心环节。这次会议郑重地讨论五年计划，把这种认识更加明确了。这就保证了五年计划将得到全体代表
  一致同意通过，并将得到全国人民一致拥护实施。
    大家都记得，宪法第十五条规定：“国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全。”第一个五年计划开始实现宪法的规定，为我国人民享受和平幸福提供保证，是值得全国人民庆幸的事。尤其使人兴奋的，李富春副总理在报告里说：“在苏联的直接帮助下，五年内我国将开始和平利用原子能的建设，使之为国民经济服务。”这是我们去年通过宪法时还没有能够设想的！我们感谢苏联的真诚援助，我们庆祝和平力量的飞跃前进！
    我从赫尔辛基归来，参加这次会议，特别感到兴奋。在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会，有六十八个国家的一千八百多名代表参加，发布了大会宣言和七个委员会的决议，对当前迫切的国际局势问题，指出了行动的方向，反映了世界人民共同的愿望，这是和平力量的又一次大胜利。与会各国的代表，对于我国都非常敬爱，非常亲切，他们重视有关我国的各项问题和我国代表的意见。有不少人到过我国，谈到我国的经济建设，异口同声地称颂；没有到过我国的人也都欣羡我国的经济建设。我们可以说，全世界爱好和平的人民都确信中国人民热爱和平，中国进行社会主义经济建设是为自己创造和平幸福，为世界推进和平力量。我相信：第一个五年计划的通过，将是对全世界爱好和平的人民的巨大鼓舞。
    我在五月间，曾随同乌兰夫副总理，参加捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年庆祝典礼的我国政府代表团，亲眼看到了捷克斯洛伐克解放十年来在建设社会主义各方面的伟大成就，看到了捷克斯洛伐克人民日益提高的物质生活和文化生活，体会了捷克斯洛伐克的人民对中国人民无比的热情和深厚的友爱；他们听到我国支持华沙会议的决定，表示极大的喜悦，弥切认识到中国人民制止侵略战争、保卫世界和平的坚强意志和雄厚力量；他们关心我国进行的社会主义经济建设，祝贺我国对帝国主义者斗争中的不断胜利，他们把中国人民每一个成就和胜利都看做自己的成就和胜利；我们参观俄斯特拉发等工厂时，工人们指点着我国定制的许多机器，表示出无限的热情。和平民主和社会主义国家的人民紧密地团结在一起，确实形成了全世界坚强无比的和平堡垒。李富春副总理在报告里着重说明苏联和各人民民主国家的国际援助同我国建设的关系，是有着巨大意义的。
    各位代表：请允许我稍谈一点我个人的健康情况。我在一九四九年来到北京以前，身体是不大好的，看书稍多便觉头部发胀，走路过快便觉胸部刺痛，医师检查，说我心脏弱，不宜登高和快跑，当然更不适宜高空飞行，因此我失去了出国的机会。近年来，上述病况渐次减少，今春医师诊断我心脏和其他各部分都很正常，我报告了领导上，便得于短时期内两次接受出国的使命。我的年纪增长，为什么健康反而改好呢？人们常说，生活在毛泽东时代是幸福的，我便是最好的证明。解放以前，我痛心于蒋介石破坏孙中山先生的三大政策，违反孙先生
  “和平奋斗救中国”的遗言，心里常是忧愁苦闷，身体当然要受损害；解放以来，眼见全国大陆得到和平统一，经济恢复以后即开始有计划的和平建设，中国人民不只自己享受和平幸福，还能担负起保卫世界和平的责任，精神上无比愉快，身体便自然健旺。各位代表想有不少和我同感的，我们都应当感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。看我这实在的例子，在台湾的人可以不再听信谣言，说在大陆的人怎样痛苦了。“我们正在做着为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事”，虽然前面还有困难，奋斗还须艰苦，但困难可以克服，艰苦本所不辞，我们是十分兴奋愉快的。第一个五年计划和一九五五年预算，一定可以胜利地完成并超额完成！我们每个人都应当提高政治警惕性和思想觉悟，勤恳工作，紧密团结，为完成这一光荣任务而努力奋斗！
    吴耀宗代表的发言
    我热烈拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并完全同意李富春副总理关于这个计划的报告。
      “五年计划”这个名词我不知听过多少次了。我知道这是一件很好的事情；我大概知道一点苏联几个五年计划的伟大成就；在我国宣布实行五年计划的时候，我也感到高兴。然而这只是一件理智上的事。直到这一次听了李富春副总理的报告，仔细地看过“五年计划”的草案，我才亲切地体会到“五年计划”，对中国人民来说，甚至对全世界来说，具有怎样重大的、历史的意义。
    我相信每一个中国人民，在看过“五年计划”的报告之后，都会感到极度的兴奋和无限的喜悦。这个计划是多么的具体、多么的全面、多么的精细。整个计划不但具有高度的科学性，它的全部精神也洋溢着对人民的热爱。正如李富春副总理所说的：
  “我们正在做着为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事。”几千年来，大多数的中国人民都过着穷苦的生活，忍受着各种剥削与压迫。他们也许听见过所谓尧、舜、禹、汤的“黄金时代”和一些关于国计民生的高谈阔论，然而这并不曾激起过什么人的热情。谁又能想到：仅仅在解放三年之后，新中国便能开始第一个“五年计划”的建设，真正走上繁荣富强的大道呢？
    在这个包罗万象，五色缤纷的“五年计划”中，有许多项目是我们以前所不敢梦想的。举一个例：黄河的根治和综合开发的工作。在我国历史上，黄河一直是为害最严重的河道。西方的作家们常把黄河称作“中国的烦恼”。但“五年计划”却要破天荒地开始根治黄河，在三门峡等处建设巨大的水库和水力发电站。这不但可以永远消灭黄患，并且将使黄河为无数的人民造福。再举一个例：“五年内我国将开始和平利用原子能的建设，使之为国民经济服务。”在帝国主义挥舞着原子武器，以原子战争来威胁善良人民的今天，我们在第一个五年计划里面，就开始和平利用原子能，这实在是使人无限兴奋的一件事。
    我们的“五年计划”是不是纸上空谈呢？在国民党反动派的时候，我们也曾看见过多如牛毛的法令，看见过繁琐不堪的什么计划，然而这些东西，在出现不久以后，都无例外地到了废纸堆里去。我们的“五年计划”却完全是另外一回事。它不但是切实可行的，而且是一定能够完全实现的。我们知道：
  “五年计划”里面的每一个项目，每一个数字，都经过精细的推敲；全部计划，也经过长时期的研究和无数次的修改。在中国共产党领导下的人民政府，是一定能够忠实地、胜利地完成第一个五年计划的历史任务的。
    第一个五年计划，不但对我国有着异常重要的历史意义，它对保卫世界和平也有着重要的意义。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，我们一贯地采取了和平的外交政策；我们一贯地提倡和平共处的原则。没有比第一个五年计划更能雄辩地说明新中国和平意图的事实。在五年内，全国经济建设和文化教育建设的支出总数为七百六十六亿四千万元，折合黄金七万万两以上。如果中国是一个侵略的国家，如果我们的政策是战争的政策，我们就不可能用这样大量的资金来进行国家建设。我们自己不会发动战争，我们也不愿意看见任何国家发动战争，因为我们的和平建设，必须有一个和平的环境才能进行。两年以来，国际局势有了一些缓和。在最近几个月中，东西方若干国家负责领袖的相互访问和友好关系的发展，使和平地区的扩大，有了更多的可能。我国五年建设计划的执行，将更清楚地显示了中国人民爱好和平的意愿。
    第一个五年计划不只显示了中国人民爱好和平的意愿，更因为这个计划是使我国繁荣富强和人民幸福的第一个计划，正如李富春副总理所说的：它的实现，也将增强世界和平民主阵营的力量。
    第一个五年计划的设计和进行，开辟了中国历史一个崭新的局面。为了这一个划时代的发展，我们不得不感谢中国共产党和毛主席的领导；我们不得不感谢伟大的苏联人民对我国真诚无私的援助；我们不得不感谢一切兄弟国家对我们的同情和合作。我们更要对已经在各个工作岗位上和将要参加工作，为完成第一个五年计划而努力的劳动人民和工作人员，致以崇高的敬礼。
    五年计划的完成，不只是政府的事，也要依靠全国人民的努力和合作。每一个中国人民，对五年计划的完成，都应当有直接的或间接的贡献。
    五年来，中国基督教的自治、自养、自传运动有了很大的发展。这是一个反帝爱国的运动，通过这个运动，全国基督徒对爱国主义的认识和爱国的热诚都有了提高。全国基督徒积极地参加了各种爱国运动，参加了地方上各项中心任务。许多基督徒在工作上有了好的表现，做了模范。第一个五年计划是开始改变中国的面貌，为全国人民，为我们的子子孙孙，创造无穷幸福的伟大计划。我们全国基督徒衷心拥护这个计划，并愿意为这个计划的实施，献出我们最大的力量。
    帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，对新中国一直采取敌视的态度；他们对新中国基督教的三自爱国运动，也一直采取敌视的态度。五年来，他们一直企图用种种方法，破坏这个运动，分裂这个运动。我们全国的教会和各种基督教组织里面的基督徒必须提高警惕，分清敌我，辨别是非，在反帝爱国的基础上，巩固我们的团结，扩大我们的团结，以实际的爱国行动，来打击帝国主义的阴谋。这样，我们对建设祖国、保卫世界和平的神圣事业，就能够有实际的贡献。
    俞平伯代表的发言
    我完全赞同李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。我热诚拥护第一个五年计划草案。因为这个计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。它使我看清楚了我们伟大祖国繁荣富强的灿烂光辉的前途，使我无比的兴奋，非常的鼓舞。
    李副总理的报告里指出：“实现五年计划，是在现在环境下的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。”很多事实都说明：在过渡时期阶级斗争是格外尖锐的。剥削阶级是不会自己甘心被消灭的。那些反革命分子必定要千方百计地企图破坏我们的计划。从各地揭发的材料看：在全国范围内还有一些残余的反革命分子，反动的地主富农，怙恶不悛的刑事罪犯，反动的会道门，妄想从各方面来破坏我们国家的事业，为了保障五年计划的胜利实现，我们必须坚决镇压
  一切反革命分子的破坏活动。
    公开的反革命分子比较的容易肃清，而隐蔽的就比较难于发现，他们的危害性也将更加严重。因此对于隐藏在我们的队伍中的反革命分子尤其需要坚决的肃清，使他们不能对我们的伟大的社会主义建设事业进行阴谋破坏。如最近发现的胡风反革命集团便是一个突出的例子。胡风潜伏在革命的队伍里二十多年，进行着有组织、有计划的反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动，到底被揭发了，打垮了。这是党和人民的一大胜利。我们从这里吸取深刻的教训，更要加强马克思列宁主义的学习。这样，就可以提高我们的政治警惕性和对反革命分子的辨别能力，把那些隐藏的反革命分子揭露出来。胡风反革命集团的阴谋诡计已在党和人民巨大的威力一击之下粉碎了。其他一切一切反革命分子，都要一一的被人民所揭发和粉碎的。
    我们不仅为了提高警惕，彻底镇压反革命，需要加强马克思列宁主义的学习来进行思想改造。同时为了完满地实现伟大的五年计划，也必须加强学习，进行思想改造。毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上早已指示过：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”毛主席这一个指示的无比的正确性，我在今天有了更进一步的体会。
    我个人深深感到像我这样的旧知识分子，必须积极地改造，才能对伟大的社会主义建设事业出一把力，作一些我所能够作也应该作的事情，尽我所应尽的光荣的责任。我过去在“红楼梦研究”里散布了唯心主义的错误思想，而自己还不知道。我感谢全国各地的同志给我宝贵的批评。这是一场严肃尖锐的思想斗争。在当时，对我来说自不能不感到相当痛苦。但是，在半年以后的今天回想起来，经过这次的学习和锻炼，我明白了很多的道理，懂得了几十年来所不认识的自己思想方法的毛病。
    首先，我要说我初步地学习马克思列宁主义，认识了资产阶级反动的文艺理论的危害性，因而端正了文学研究的方向。当然我的认识还很肤浅，但对我来说，应该说收获是很大的。我在解放前没有学习马克思列宁主义，解放后我虽然学习了，但跟自己的业务联系不起来。因此，我仍旧只顾业务，仍旧忽视政治。现在才知道这就是脱离实际，脱离群众的路子，脱离了阶级斗争。当时我错误地认为：马克思列宁主义和我的研究工作关系不大，搞政法财经工作的同志们必须学习马克思列宁主义，而研究古典文学像“红楼梦”之类就不一定要学习。现在我深刻地体会到学习马克思列宁主义，改造思想，对于我们每个知识分子，对于每一项革命工作都是非常重要的。否则，我们便不可避免地要犯错误，纵然我们用了力气，下了工夫，想做些对人民有益的事情，结果也将适得其反，对国家和人民发生不好的作用。这是一个沉痛的教训，我愿意提供我们大家参考。
    其次，在批评我的错误思想的过程中，共产党的、民主党派的负责同志和文艺界的朋友们对我的关怀和帮助，使我非常感动，使我具体地领会到共产党对知识分子一面团结、一面改造的政策是完全正确的。这样把严肃的批评与热情诚恳的关怀和帮助结合起来，完全符合毛主席的指示：“从团结出发，经过批评和斗争，达到团结的目的。”这样的思想改造，不但不妨碍团结，相反地能把团结更巩固和加强起来。人民内部的批评与对反革命集团的揭露和消灭完全是两回事。有的人对学术思想批判因此产生了顾虑，这完全是误解。真理只有通过自由争辩才能达到的。我有决心加强马克思列宁主义的学习，彻底改正我过去唯心主义思想的错误，积极努力，以正确的观点方法为人民的文学，人民的事业服务。同时我要警告台湾美蒋反动集团和大陆上暗藏的一切反革命分子，他们企图从知识分子自我改造运动中来挑拨离间，造谣生事，这种阴谋都是枉费心机，一定要失败的。
    最后，我说，让我们知识分子紧紧地团结在共产党和毛主席领导下，跟广大的工人农民结合起来，为完成第一个五年计划而奋斗，为做好为全国人民和我们后代谋长远幸福的伟大事业而奋斗。
    李纯青代表的发言
    在我们的五年计划里，有一个中国的地方没有它的数字；在我们建设祖国的伟大事业中，有一部分中国人不能来参加。这个地方就是台湾，这一部分中国人就是台湾人民。
    我要为台湾人民说几句话。
    在中国几乎没有工业的时候，日本抢去了台湾。台湾同胞受尽苦难，深知国家工业化的重要。如果说，我们在实现两个五年计划之后，工业基础就会赶上并超过日本，我相信，没有人能比台湾同胞更高兴。曾经失掉祖国五十年、现在还不能受到祖国保护的台湾人，我不能用言语来表达，他们是多么需要一个富强的中国！五年计划将使中国走向社会主义工业化，将使中国逐步富强起来，我相信，台湾同胞拥护五年计划的感情是深刻的；要求五年计划实现的愿望是迫切的。
    但是对台湾同胞来说，眼前的事实是残酷的：在祖国人民欢欣鼓舞的今天，他们生活在苦难中。
    台湾是中国人民的台湾。在隋唐时代，那里还是一个荒岛，中国劳动人民一代又一代地用血汗把它开辟出来，台湾才有今天的富饶和美丽。现在台湾可以年产八十万吨的糖，两百万吨的大米，三万万斤的香蕉，两千万斤的茶叶，生产占世界总产量百分之七十的樟脑，有五十万瓩的电力设备，全岛十分之七的地面长着各种良好的木材。这样丰富的物产资源，本来应该列入我们的五年计划，为祖国所用。而现在却被蒋介石集团所抢占，他们抢占着台湾产业十分之九，抢占着台湾土地十分之七，这群蝗虫正在破坏着台湾同胞的家园。同时，美国通过和蒋介石签订的各种卖国条约，正在源源不断地抽取着台湾经济的血液。
    我们从旧中国过来的人，都受过蒋介石统治的灾难，今天，那些可怕的灾难大部分集中在台湾同胞身上。蒋介石对台湾人民进行着残酷的剥削，并且剥削的程度是在不断地增加。例如，一九五三年的台湾预算，税收和其他勒索占百分之八十三，一九五四年的台湾税收，就比一九四九年多出三十七倍，其中盐税一项，竟然多出三百二十六倍。在美国和蒋介石双重掠夺和榨取之下，台湾有劳动力的人大批失业，许多妇女被迫沦为娼妓，儿童普遍害着严重的疾病，台湾到处有人在卖儿鬻女，家家都要和饥饿以至死亡作斗争。不但如此，蒋介石为了维持他的黑暗统治，在台湾遍布特务，监视着每个人的行动，危害着每个人的自由和安全，台湾人民的生命毫无保障。台湾已经成为一座大监狱，四周的海水就是监狱的围墙。
    各位代表，在哥伦布发现新大陆九百年前，中国人民就早已开始开发台湾，在美国国家诞生四百多年前，中国就在台湾建立了地方政府。在地方行政上，台湾一直是福建的一部分，直到中法战争后一八八七年，台湾才建立为行省。台湾和福建的关系，就像海南岛和广东的关系一样。台湾是中国的领土，是从来不发生疑问的。美国没有任何理由可以侵占中国的领土台湾；我们解放台湾是行使国家主权，是中国的内政问题，美国没有任何权利可以干涉和阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。我们知道，八百万台湾人民都是中国人民，其中汉人占百分之九十八，在汉人中，绝大部分是闽南人，其次是广东客家人，再其次是中国各省的人。还有二十万高山族同胞。在台湾并不存在像某些人所说的有一个“台湾民族”，从而也不存在什么“台湾独立”的问题。所谓台湾“独立”“中立”“托管”“公民投票”等一切谬论，都是出于帝国主义的阴谋，都是对台湾人民莫大的侮辱。台湾人民包括高山族人民，他们有祖国，他们热爱自己伟大的祖国，他们有光荣的斗争历史，为反对外来的侵略、保卫祖国的领土台湾而流血斗争，数百年如一日。现在，他们仍然在为回到自己的祖国——中华人民共和国的怀抱里来，而不屈服地作英勇的斗争。台湾同胞坚决反对美国侵占台湾，他们过去不做日本的奴隶，今天也绝不做美国的奴隶。台湾同胞在一九四七年二月曾起来反抗蒋介石的残暴统治，在大陆的中国人已经推翻了蒋介石政权，在台湾的中国人也绝不要这个祸国殃民的傀儡。台湾同胞拥护祖国解放台湾的一切决策，日日夜夜盼望着解放时日的到来。
    台湾是中国的领土。美国侵占台湾不但破坏了中国的主权和领土完整，威胁着我国的安全和和平建设，而且已经造成远东的紧张局势，使亚洲和世界人民感到不安。中国人民是爱好和平的。中华人民共和国政府不止一次地表示，愿意坐下来同美国谈判和缓远东局势问题，特别是和缓台湾地区紧张局势问题。我们要问：美国政府究竟愿不愿意坐下来谈判？究竟要不要和平？
    应该指出，美国仍然不断在台湾加强军事力量，积极在台湾地区准备战争，最近还把两百多架喷气式飞机交给蒋介石。就在我们这次大会开幕前几天，美国舰队还在澎湖海面举行大规模演习。台湾距离美国五千多浬，和美国的安全风马牛不相及。中国人民不能容忍美国的战争威胁，不能容许美国企图长久占领中国的领土台湾。美国政府应立即把它的武装力量，包括美国第七舰队、美国空军和其他军事力量，从台湾撤走。中国人民是不要同美国打仗的。如果帝国主义者硬要把战争加到我们头上，我们应该告诉它：从战争中锻炼过来的中国人民，是不怕战争的。
    我们相信：五年计划的事业胜利前进，台湾也就一天天地接近解放。我请求大会通过五年计划。彭德怀副总理在报告中说：中国人民解放军必须
  “积极准备力量解放祖国的领土台湾”，我要向中国人民解放军，表示深深的感激。在黑暗中生活的台湾人民，有了毛主席，他们就有光明；有着六万万的兄弟姊妹，他们就有最后胜利的信心。台湾是 一定会解放的。台湾人民是一定要回来的。
    盛丕华代表的发言
    听了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，彭德怀副总理关于兵役法草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，和邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利综合规划的报告，我完全同意并拥护这些报告。
    第一个五年计划是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求制定的，因此，集中主要力量优先建设重工业，成为计划的中心环节，这是为社会主义工业化奠定基础所必要的，它为实现我们国家富强、人民幸福规划了具体途径。多少年来，全国人民梦寐以求的国家工业化的愿望，已经开始逐步实现。这是多么令人欢欣鼓舞的事！一九五四年的国家决算显示了一九五四年国家预算正确执行的辉煌效果，
  一九五五年国家预算贯彻增加生产、厉行节约的方针，以便积累资金，保证国民经济首先是重工业建设的需要，并保持相当的财政后备力量，是完全正确的。从常务委员会工作报告中，知道潘汉年从事反革命活动的罪行，使我感到无比的愤恨。常委会根据最高人民检察院张鼎丞检察长的请求，已批准将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风先后依法逮捕审判，这是全国人民进行反对国内外敌人斗争中的一个大胜利，是大快人心的。
    第一个五年计划是在国民经济已经恢复的基础上进行的。五年多来，由于共产党的正确领导，我们国家在各个战线上都获得了伟大的胜利，社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导作用和领导地位，随着人民民主专政的日益巩固，已经大大地提高起来。由于全国人民不断增长的对共产党的信任和支持，由于苏联和人民民主国家，特别是苏联，给予我们长期的、全面的、无私的援助，再由于这个计划的编制，经过实践和讨论，多次的补充和修正，已经积累了不少的经验，就为第一个五年计划的全部实现，提供了有利的条件和坚强的物质基础。我们有充分信心，为它的实现而努力！
    我国建设社会主义的事业，是以社会主义工业化为主体的，而对农业、手工业的社会主义改造和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造是两个必要的组成部分，这三者是不可分割的。解放以来，私营工商业者在工人阶级和中国共产党的领导和教育下，思想认识在不同程度上有所提高，但其中还有人在接触到某些具体问题的时候，思想认识又会模糊起来，也还有少数人依然存在着抗拒思想。具体表现在，不少的私营工商业者初步认识了中国不能走资本主义的道路，只能走社会主义的道路，因而，在接受社会主义改造方面，愈来愈多的资本主义工商业，走上了公私合营、加工、定货、经销、代销等各种不同形式的国家资本主义的轨道，懂得企业改造要与个人思想改造相结合的道理，加强学习，积极工作；在改善经营管理方面，在提高质量、降低成本方面，在响应国家号召、爱国守法方面，都有了一定的进展；对企业和个人的接受社会主义改造，发挥了积极有益的作用。但是，也还有不少的私营工商业者，由于对企业改造必须结合个人思想改造的重要意义认识不足，有的接受改造只是为了解除企业的困难；有的欢迎政府对企业进行安排，但又忽视了个人的改造；有的对于接受国营经济的领导，存在着怀疑、顾虑；有的以为企业一经合营，便是“万事大吉”，可以“坐享其成”。这些思想情况的存在，在不同程度上都阻碍了私营工商业者自己的改造。此外，更有少数人坚持错误，抗拒改造，进行非法活动；对于这些人，必须进行坚决的斗争。
      此外，私营工商业者对于国际形势和政治问题，思想认识上也表现着混乱的情况。例如，人民日报揭发了胡风反革命集团的材料之后，有的以为胡风事件是文艺界的事，与工商界无关；有的认为今后说话要当心，不要被人看作胡风分子；有的把胡风的“两面派”与民族资产阶级的“两面性”混同起来，因而对于革命与反革命的敌我界线，缺乏正确的认识。
    私营工商业者的政治认识跟不上客观形势的发展。主要原因是学习不够。首先是自己学习不够，只注意眼前的利益得失，看不见国家与自己的远大前途，不关心国内外时事，在行动上表现为彷徨、消极，缺乏主人翁的思想。另一方面，我们在协助政府对私营工商业者进行思想教育的工作上，做得不够。特别是不够广泛深入。除了工商界一部分骨干之外，广大的私营工商业者，还没有充分机会经常听到有关政策和时事宣传的报告，更谈不到有组织地进行讨论学习。宣传教育的方法，也比较呆板，流于公式化，不够生动活泼、联系实际。文字的宣传工作，也不够通俗，因此效果不大。
    不容否认，私营工商业者的思想认识落后，会影响国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的进行，因而也会影响到我们的社会主义建设事业的进行的。今后我们必须克服过去所存在的缺点，做好对私营工商业者的思想教育工作，推动大家努力学习，端正认识，服从国家计划，厉行节约，消灭浪费，为国家建设积累资金，做好国家委托的任务。同时，我也希望国营经济部门的同志，在领导私营工商业改造企业的过程中，注意加强对资本家个人思想改造的领导。私营工商业者一定要在提高政治认识的基础上，认真地接受社会主义改造，正确地发挥在五年计划建设中应有的作用，和全国人民一道，兢兢业业，提高警惕，分清敌我，防止国内外敌人的阴谋破坏，为全部实现第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    曹禺代表的发言
    这几天，当我们正在诚诚恳恳地讨论第一个五年计划和根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的时候，当我们怀着极大的喜悦和信心讨论“为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事”的时候，我在想，如果胡风反革命集团到现在还没有被揭露，胡风还没有被逮捕，那岂不是胡风——这个暗藏的蒋匪特务还会藏在我们当中，也要参加这个讨论么？我深深地感觉到我们过去对暗藏的反革命分子不够警惕，是多么可怕！
    感谢党，感谢我们的政府，及时地揭露了这个反革命集团，逮捕审判胡风这个罪大恶极的反革命分子。这个大快人心的举动不只说明我们的政府是最民主的政府，也是最有力量的政府。
      一想起胡风反革命集团的恶毒、阴险，和对我们人民事业的仇视，我的心就充满了愤怒。但是今天已经不是仅仅表示我们对反革命分子如何愤怒的时候，而是已经到了这样的关头，我们必须要下定决心，通过这场斗争，把自己锻炼成为眼光锐利的坚强战士，叫一切反革命分子遇到了我们，就无从藏身！
    我们是坚决要批驳这样的话的：胡风反革命集团不过是一群作家，车沟里的泥鳅成不了龙，他们怎么能够兴风作浪呢？作家么？人说，作家是灵魂的工程师，可是这批东西是灵魂的刽子手。且不说他们仇恨人民的反动思想毒害了多少人，就先看看这批东西肮脏的历史吧：以革命的文艺理论家面貌出现的胡风，原来是围攻井冈山的剿共军的反共政治工作人员；以诗人面貌出现的绿原，原来是中美合作所的美蒋特务；以小说家面貌出现的芦甸，原来是蒋匪中央军官学校的指导员；以批评家面貌出现的阿垅，原来是蒋匪陆军大学的战术教官；以大学文学教授面貌出现的贾植芳，原来是贩卖人口的土匪。他们恨极了共产党，恨极了人民民主专政，恨极了我们在此地这样热烈地讨论的中国人民的永久事业。他们用“阴暗的聪明”，要瓦解我们的革命队伍，脸上贴着伪装的马克思列宁主义的美丽的花纹，就这样，打进了我们的经济、文化、军事、学校、各种机关里，探听党内秘密，骗取共产党员的称号，他们的头子甚至于钻进最高国家权力机关——全国人民代表大会。这批毒菌，已经深入我们的肝脏，我们还忍心说这是车沟里的泥鳅，对人民不能兴风作浪吗？全中国人民都恨极了，要扑死这群毒蛇。蒋匪帮在台湾如丧考妣，大哭大叫，痛惜他最得力的走狗、特务终于灭亡在人民的手里。蒋匪哭了，人民笑了，这是我们在镇压反革命运动中极其巨大的胜利！
    我们是坚决要批驳这样的话的：胡风集团的反革命活动确实是证据确凿，那末就干脆依法惩治，何必又是宣传，又是学习，耗费了我们从事建设的宝贵的时间。这些天报上登载的反革命的破坏活动，早已批驳了这种只求简单化的思想。残酷的事实说明，如果我们不决心肃清一切反革命分子，我们今天这样美好的建设就会为反革命分子增加破坏的目标。在这场惊心动魄的斗争中，我深深感觉到太平观念和自由主义会把人变成瞎子，叫人看不见在我们眼前严重的阶级斗争。我想伟大的共产党是组织上最严密的，政治警惕性最高的，思想领导最坚强的，但是敌人——反革命分子，用各种伪装，用
  “阴暗的聪明”，还要钻进来，破坏我们。敌人并不那样愚蠢，他也知道堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。我想，敌人都会混进共产党里面，那末为什么他们不能够混进各民主党派，各人民团体，以及各工商业的机构里面呢？事实上，在这些党派和团体、机构里，不是已经发现了暗藏的敌人吗？我们不能把这个斗争简单化，我们必须在这个斗争里好好地学习。胡风反革命集团所采取对我们进攻的战术，是一切暗藏的反革命分子对人民进攻共同采用的战术，它是最典型的。深刻地学习“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”，就能使我们提高警惕，帮助我们看穿一切暗藏的反革命分子的假面目。
    我们是坚决要批驳这样的话的：胡风和其他的反革命分子居然在我们当中潜伏了多少年，敌人这样会伪装，使我们感觉到周围的人都可以怀疑，仿佛这样就是提高警惕了。说这样话的人不是太天真，就是别有用心的。如果这种想法散播开，它的效果会是什么呢？那就是在我们革命队伍中会搞得是非不明，真假不分，让好人对革命事业失去了信心，让坏人、反革命分子乘机混过关去，是会造成混乱局面的。党一直教导我们实事求是，毫无根据的猜疑跟一个革命工作者应有的革命警惕性是没有共同之点的。我们的革命队伍里绝大多数，百分之九十五以上都是好人，只有少数是暗藏的反革命分子和坏分子。建设一座水力发电站要数万人乃至十数万人的力量，但是破坏它，只要一个暗藏的反革命分子就成了。所以，反革命分子尽管少，我们必须团结起来，用一切力量肃清。我们有正确的领导，我们现在有广大人民的政治觉悟，最重要的，我们有马克思列宁主义的武器，因此，我们镇压反革命的工作是非常科学的，非常实事求是的，是无坚不摧的。
    在学习当中，我个人有两个体会。第一，要警惕一切反革命分子，首先要警惕自己的个人主义和自由主义。“个人主义与自由主义是反革命分子的好朋友”，凡是认真学习过“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”的人，都会认识到这句话是绝对正确的。第二，经过这次学习，我感觉到我必须更要靠拢共产党和人民政府，必须对共产党和人民政府做到绝对的忠诚老实。这不只是我个人的要求，凡是爱国爱党爱人民的人都自然的从心里会有这样的要求。我深深感到一个人如果做到对党无所不谈，他就必然有充分的勇敢和力量对反革命分子进行斗争。事实就是这样：好人想靠拢党和政府就会愈靠愈拢，当所有的好人都完完全全向党靠拢了，那暗藏的反革命分子就会被孤立起来，失掉了藏身之地。
   　我爱我们的祖国，不只因为它给了我们幸福、民主、自由，给了我们一个真正的和睦的大家庭的感情，更因为五年来，从各方面的进步和建设的光辉成就中，我感觉到劳动从来没有发挥过这样伟大的力量，做一个中国人，从来没有这样可以自豪过。我站在这个台上，我感觉到全中国的人民都用幸福的目光，满藏着喜悦同信心的目光注视着我们，万分殷切地关心着我们现在讨论的社会主义建设的大事，但是他们更迫切地嘱咐过我们，不能再放过反革命分子在我们幸福的国家里面活动了，不能再允许社会主义建设受到一丝一毫破坏了。这个庄严的嘱托，这个关系到无数人的生命、事业、幸福的嘱托，我们是一定要做到的。今天，全中国人民的政治警惕性和阶级觉悟确实大大提高了。有一句老话，十目所视，十手所指，这就够严厉的了。现在，我们有六亿人的眼睛在注视着，六亿人的手在警戒着，一切的反革命分子无论如何是逃不出人民的手掌的。
    叶剑英代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理及彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。我仅就巩固国防问题，发表一点意见。
    我国的社会主义经济建设，除了需要正确的领导和全国人民共同的努力外，同时还需要有一个长期的国际和平环境。战后十年，美帝国主义集团，实行实力政策，组织侵略集团，积极准备战争。这一期间，国际局势一直是紧张的。但是争取缓和、导致和平的条件是具有可能的。以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的力量空前强大和团结；它们所倡导的和平共处的外交政策得到了世界广大人民的拥护与支持，由于和平事业的正义性，获得世界各国人民的强烈拥护。这些，就是我们争取长期的国际和平环境成为可能的重要因素。目前的国际局势，是朝着有利于和平方面发展的。我们欢迎这种发展的趋势。但争取和平又是一个持久的、艰巨的大斗争。这个斗争是复杂的、曲折的。我们必须继续努力，争取同所有赞同和平共处的国家建立友好关系，把和平事业担当起来，对一切阻挠、破坏和平的战争势力，给予不断的揭露和坚决的回击。
    但是，我们也万万不能低估帝国主义的侵略野心。美帝国主义仍然侵占我国的领土台湾，多方阻挠我国人民解放台湾的事业；美国的统治集团，正在各种各色“和平”外衣的掩盖下，加紧准备战争。美国的军事费用比较战前大为增加；一直保持着近三百万现役部队和二百四十万左右的后备役军队，并继续大力发展空军，将原子武器作为军队中常规武器，积极准备原子战争。为了向外扩张其侵略势力，美国的武装部队还在别国的领土上建立了大量的军事基地。同时，大家知道，在美国的指使下，近几年来，还建立了各种各样的侵略性的军事联盟。如北大西洋集团、巴黎协定、土耳其—伊拉克—巴基斯坦协定、“东南亚集体防务条约”等等；美国又先后与日本、李承晚集团、蒋匪帮、南越的吴庭艳等签订了一连串的协定，最近，美国又和柬埔寨订立了所谓“美柬军事援助协定”，并和老挝王国酝酿着签订类似的协定。美国统治集团所以如此狂热地在世界各地建立军事基地，组织各种各样的军事集团，其企图在于：把西德和日本重新武装起来；并拉拢英、法等资本主义国家及东南亚、中东、近东、北非某些国家，为美国垄断资本的战争利润服务。
    美帝国主义独霸世界的野心，是非常狂妄的。它为了这一不可告人的罪恶目的，贸然投入新的军事冒险，永远是可能的。中国人民和中国人民解放军对此必须要有充分的戒备和警惕！
    中国人民面对这一形势，为着保卫祖国与人民的安全，保卫祖国社会主义建设，解放我国领土台湾，并准备应付侵略者的突然袭击，必须采取各种可能的措施，继续加强中国人民解放军。就是说，要有足够数量的、最新式的现代装备，武装中国人民解放军。因为，站在我们面前的是一支装备优良的帝国主义军队，中国人民解放军，在几十年的革命战争中，常常是处在劣势装备的情况下，战胜了强大的敌人，但如果加上有现代武器，就更能有力地回击这样的侵略者的进犯，更能在反侵略战争中获得胜利。但有些人似乎还不理解这点。他们认为，现在只要集中力量搞社会主义经济建设，对于国防建设可以不必那样重视了。他们不懂得，国防建设固然要依靠国家工业化，但我们在进行社会主义经济建设的同时，如果不能保持足够的国防力量，我们就会处于脆弱境地；帝国主义一旦向我们发动侵略战争，我们就有丧失国家独立、破坏社会主义事业的危险。也有人这样怀疑：我们提出加强国防力量，会不会促使帝国主义更早的发动战争？他们不懂得一条真理：帝国主义的虚弱表现，就是欺软怕硬。如果我们有了足以抵御一切侵略者的强大的国防力量，我们就能保住和平，就能制止或推迟侵略战争的爆发；如果我们软弱无力，就会招致战争，不能得到和平。
    目前我军的装备较前已有了很大改善。但应该看到：我国现阶段的工业发展水平，还不可能为部队提供大量的最新式的装备。这一情况，显然与现代的国防需要是不相适应的。要改变这一落后情况，只有加速发展我国的工业，特别是重工业；而在我国工业没有建立起来以前，在一定范围内采用国外订货的临时办法也是必需的。斯大林说过：
  “没有重工业就无法保卫国家，所以赶快着手发展重工业，如果这件事稍迟一着，那就等于失败。”毛主席教导我们说：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”这一些指示，对我国社会主义经济建设和国防建设，都具有巨大的指导意义和实际意义。我们完全拥护以发展重工业为重点的我国第一个五年计划。
    现代的武装力量，还要有雄厚的兵源作后备。义务兵役制的实行，为我国建立强大的兵役后备，提供了可靠的保证。国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀同志在关于兵役法草案的报告中指出：“因为实行了义务兵役制，就有了定期征集和定期退伍制度，每年都有一批在人民解放军部队服现役期满的、经过军队实际生活锻炼的士兵退伍，转入第一类预备役，每年都有大批具备服现役条件、而未被征集服现役的公民编入第二类预备役。同时，每年都有服现役期满的军官转入军官预备役，也有从学校里，从非军事系统的国家机关、企业里，培养和积蓄起来的大量的预备役军官。我们有了大量的训练有素的预备役兵员和足够数量的预备役军官，我们有了正在成长的社会主义国家工业的物资保证，我们就不怕任何敌人的侵略。一旦帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，我们就能够在这种雄厚的基础上迅速地组成足够数量的军队，给予坚决的回击，保卫国家的安全。”由此可见，实行义务兵役制，对加强我国国防力量有着迫切而重大的意义。中国人民解放军坚决拥护我国的义务兵役制度，为了义务兵役制的彻底实施，我们要训练好我们的部队，努力办好我们的学校。
    中国人民解放军是中国共产党和毛泽东同志依据马克思列宁主义建立起来的革命武装。历史证明，这支武装的素质是优良的，战斗力是坚强的。为了适应国防的需要，近几年来，中国人民解放军陆、海、空军各部队，在苏联专家热诚的帮助下，普遍进行着现代的、正规的战斗训练和技术、战术、条令、政治等教育，训练的效果是好的。在部队中，经过几年来的训练，每个军官的作战指挥艺术和管理部属的才能，在原有的基础上都提高了一大步，他们不但学会与掌握了本兵种的战术、技术，而且也学会了现代合成军队的作战指挥艺术。每个军士和兵都进一步地掌握了自己手中的武器，学会了在新条件下的战斗动作。但是，根据现代战争的要求来衡量，应该承认：我军在掌握现代的军事技术、运用现代战争的作战技能等方面，还是处在比较落后的状态。显然，这与当前形势所赋予我们的任务是不相适应的。因此，我们不能存有丝毫的自满。应该继续努力学习，迎头赶上。只有我们掌握了现代战争所要求的指挥艺术与作战技能，同时为应付突然事变充分的作好了思想准备与物质准备，我们才能够随时随地有把握地给侵犯我国的敌人以致命的打击。
    这里，我想还要提一下，为了培养预备役军官，为了增强青年学生的国防观念，根据兵役法草案第五十三条和五十四条的规定，我们将遵照国防部的命令，经过今年的准备与试点，自一九五六年起，有步骤地对高级中学以上学校学生施以必要的军事训练。这一措施，我深信一定会得到全国人民的赞助与支持。
    巩固人民政权，保障国内的治安，是巩固国防不可分割的有机组成部分。所谓国防不仅指我国的国境，同时也包括广大的后方，没有巩固的后方，国防的安全是很难设想的。谁都知道，我国的政权与广大的后方是巩固的、稳定的；但决不要被当前的“太平景象”迷惑了。应该清醒地看到，当前国内阶级斗争形势不是缓和而是益趋尖锐、复杂了，各种各色的反革命分子对社会主义建设与社会主义改造事业的抵抗、破坏，是更加剧烈了，更加凶恶了。反革命的复辟企图，依然是当前实际存在的危险。此次胡风、潘汉年反革命案件的揭发，正是当前阶级斗争形势的一幅具体“缩影”。因此，为了保卫我国社会主义建设，保卫人民幸福的前途，我们必须在加速提高国防力量的同时，加强公安部队的责任，协助国家司法部门严厉镇压国内的反革命分子，击破一切用两面色彩暗藏在各种组织中和军队中的反革命分子的阴谋。摆在我国人民面前的具有头等重要意义的政治任务就是，提高政治嗅觉，保卫祖国社会主义的建设，坚决解放我国的领土台湾。
    刘文辉代表的发言
    听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的五个报告，我感到非常兴奋和满意。
    可是，我们所满意的事，我们的敌人一定是不满意的。正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的：实现五年计划，是在现在环境下的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。人民的敌人决不甘心自己失败的，他们必然千方百计地来破坏我们的五年计划。因此擦亮眼睛，时时刻刻地警惕着敌人的破坏活动，继续严厉镇压反革命分子，这也是我们为了实现五年计划所必须进行的斗争任务。
    我从前对于阶级斗争的认识是非常不够的。这次我们去四川省温江专区的新繁县、彭县视察，才使我深刻地认识到反革命分子破坏的严重性。
    反革命分子的破坏活动是多种多样的。就我们这次视察十六个乡、二十八个村的情况来看，在农村中，反革命分子活动大概可分为下面几类：
    第一是散布谣言，破坏革命秩序。他们有的污蔑党和政府，企图破坏政府和人民的联系；有的歪曲政策，企图煽动落后群众，阻挠政策的贯彻；有的制造威胁性的反动标语和谣言，威胁干部和农民，以扰乱人心；有的散布反动标语和谣言，恶毒地咒骂人民革命政权，幻想反动政权的复辟，更是露骨地表现了敌对阶级对于新中国社会的仇视和抗拒情绪。
    例如：在反对使用原子武器签名游行时，彭县的反动分子在小旗上公开写着：“坚决使用原子武器”，故意将“反对”二字去掉。
    第二是破坏生产，伤害牲畜。
    例如：彭县的反动富农，今年五月撤去官渠堰水闸，影响了二百多亩田的灌溉。有的将稗子洒在别人的秧田内。有的用大石头打坏别人的秧子。
    彭县集贤乡农业生产合作社有一亩二分田的秧苗，破坏分子接连四次放水来淹死了。
    新繁县禾登乡农业生产合作社，去年突然死去猪七十多头，后来查明是地主阶级分子有计划地阴谋暗害的。
    第三是阴谋杀害干部和积极分子。
    例如：新繁县繁江乡世平村惯匪贾玉林，不满村主任对他屡次教育，乘其不备，用小刀将他刺死。
    彭县军屯乡十八村不法地主谢子清（被管制分子）经常造谣，青年团员许才贵搜集他的材料向政府报告，他心怀不满，持刀藏于路旁，企图暗杀未遂。
    彭县蒙阳乡七村，去年统购统销后，一中农
  （积极分子）被敌人谋害在池塘内，至今凶犯尚未查出。
    第四是用腐蚀的手段拉垮干部。
    例如：彭县富农罗开渠，以其妹进行美人计，两年内腐蚀了干部、青年团员等四十八人。一九五三年统购统销后被敌人拉垮的干部不少。据新繁县
  一九五四年的统计，全县乡、村干部党团员一千二百七十二人中，被收买者一百七十一人。
    第五是纵火。
    例如：彭县集贤乡八村，今年一个半月内，发生火警八次，烧去四十多户，房子二百多间，后来查明罪犯分子是一贯道。
    新繁县利济乡惯匪罗克云，解放后曾参加叛乱，六天中放火八次，并造谣是“小神子放火”，使农民不敢在家住宿，影响生产。
    更严重的是敌人的破坏反抗不仅无孔不入，并且他们的破坏活动，多是针对我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的。例如我们国家的统购统销政策，是对国家对人民都有莫大利益的，受到广大农民的拥护，只不利于敌人。但一九五三年统购统销后，新、彭二县却普遍存在过“闹缺粮”的空气，有百分之六十以上的村都不同程度的闹过“缺粮”。根据我们调查的材料来研究，“闹缺粮”的原因，不是统购多，供应少，主要是敌人煽动破坏。可以说，那里是闹粮严重的地方，那里就一定是阶级敌人破坏猖狂的地方。如彭县隆丰乡班竹村一百一十三户，五百八十五人，一九五三年总产量三十六万零八百九十四斤，除公粮五万四千一百三十四斤外，尚余粮三十万零六千七百六十斤。除统购粮五万三千七百三十斤外，每人平均尚有粮四百三十二斤。应该供应粮一万五千九百九十斤，实际供应了七万一千多斤，多供应五万五千多斤。加上供应粮，每人平均实有粮五百五十四斤。照理说应该没有问题了，但“闹缺粮”仍是很厉害。原因是潜藏的反革命分子刘志以小恩小惠拉垮村主任、武装队长、生产委员等，威胁群众百余人两次包围乡政府和乡长要求买粮。后来我们将刘志扣捕后，闹粮气焰才告平息。
    另一个例子，如新繁县崇义乡四村富农，以借钱、帮做活路的方式拉垮村代表主任陈富廷（互助组长），陈就给富农开条子套购粮食，并带动全组组员每天进馆子吃饭，向饭馆订吃饭合同，影响了百分之五十以上的群众闹粮。撤销了陈的职务后，富农即向其追收债款。我们去访问他时，他表示非常后悔，并向我们承认错误。
    再如：彭县义和乡十一村富农向清保（被管制分子），指使他的狗腿周均混入村办公室作文书，收买村主任，掌握了村政权，给地主、余粮户打条子套购粮食，并擅自扣留各种布告，隐藏起来，不使政策与群众见面，以致村里从来没有顺利地完成过任何中心工作。该村一九五三年统购任务八万多斤，只完成五万多斤。一九五四年周均被扣后，一九五四年统购任务提前完成。
    根据上面的材料看来，事情非常明白，各地所以“闹缺粮”，事实上决不是缺粮闹粮，而是有粮闹粮，不是真正的农民在闹粮，而是反革命分子和不法地主、富农在煽动闹粮，不是粮食供应紧张，而是人为的紧张。往往一个地方出现闹粮，等到我们的干部摸了底，法办了几个不法地主、富农或反革命分子，那地方的人心马上安定，闹粮的现象也过去了，紧张的空气也过去了。事实就是如此。但是我们有些人，对于各种流言，不加分析，听见风就是雨，一听到有人叫嚣“缺粮”，也就跟着起哄：“啊呀，农民没有饭吃了，不得了呀”！其实并不是农民没有饭吃，而是富农没有粮食囤积了。有人对农村情况不加调查，也叫嚣说“收购多了，供应少了，农民缺少口粮哩”！其实，收购并不多，供应也并不少，而是粮食掌握在国家手里，富农和奸商不能再做投机买卖了。有人还担心统购统销会“打击农民的生产积极性”，其实，统购统销之后，农民的生产积极性只有提高，并没有受打击，而是富农、奸商的剥削行为受到了严重的打击。所有这些不负责任地附和那些流言，跟着流言叫嚣的人，他自以为替农民说“公道”话，却不自觉地做了富农、奸商、反革命分子的传声筒；他自以为同情农民，却不知道自己上了反革命分子的当，说了违反农民利益、影响工农联盟的话。这就是麻痹大意，对目前的阶级斗争缺乏认识的结果。因此，我以为今后我们要了解农村工作，第一，先要全面地研究各项政策，弄清这个政策到底是怎么
  一回事；第二，一定要具体分析各种反映，搞清楚那些流言是从什么阶级立场的利益出发的，时刻警惕着敌人的活动；第三，还要调查研究实际情况，用事实来对证。只有这样，才有对农村工作的发言权，才能提高警惕，才能辨别敌人。现在事实证明，敌人是一定要来破坏我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的，是一定要来颠覆人民民主政权的。如果我们不提高警惕，对他们采取熟视无睹的态度，放松他们，宽容他们，那就是养起老虎吃掉自己，就会给我们人民带来巨大的灾害和损失。因此，我认为对反革命分子的处理，今后必须从严，应抓即抓，应杀即杀，及时地给反革命分子以坚决无情的打击。
    各位代表，我们的第一个五年计划就要通过了，我们正在胜利的条件下进行建设社会主义的伟大事业；我们的人民民主专政是十分巩固的；我们有中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导，我们的力量是强大的。只要我们接受党的教育，懂得敌人的反革命策略，学会辨别各种反革命分子的本领，坚持人民民主专政这个有力的武器，我们一定能够肃清一切反革命分子，摧毁国内外敌人的一切阴谋，保证五年计划的胜利实现，保护自己的革命果实和社会主义前途。
    作为全国人民代表大会代表之一，我一定要在学习和工作中，提高自己的政治警惕性，不断地克服自己的麻痹大意思想和自满情绪，热烈地投身于对一切反革命分子的斗争中，以这样的实践来拥护中国共产党和毛主席，来拥护全国人民代表大会，来拥护我们的伟大的第一个五年计划。
    邦达多吉代表的发言
    我完全赞同和拥护李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，李先念副总理
  “关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”以及其他的几个报告。
    由中国共产党中央委员会所拟定、提出的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，完全符合中华人民共和国宪法的规定，并充分照顾到少数民族地区的实际情况。它的全部完成，将把伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业向前推进一步；也将更有助于少数民族地区各项建设事业的进行，促进各民族人民生活的改善。
    在毛主席亲切的关怀下修建的康藏、青藏公路全线通车以后，昌都地区同祖国各地的联系更加密切起来了，昌都地区人民的经济、文化生活同全国各地、各民族、各项国家建设息息相关。四年多来，昌都地区主要的建设是修建康藏公路。此外，在中央人民政府的帮助下，先后成立了卫生、兽疫防治、贸易、粮食、银行、邮电等机构。政府奖励生产，进行了贷放种子、发放农牧工具、扶助土特产、工商贷款等各项有利人民的措施。因此，在执行和平解放西藏办法的协议规定的“发展西藏的农牧工商业，改善人民生活”方面，取得了显著的成就。
    但昌都地区工作中也发生过许多缺点和错误。在经济建设方面，如建立农牧试验场，由于对地区社会情况和自然条件认识不足，机械搬用外地经验，开始时就冒进大做，结果收效很小，造成浪费；基本建设工程中，开始兴造时，盲目招雇工人，工效不高，又因设计不善和材料供应脱节，致工程造价高，形成浪费。这些虽有改正和正在逐步克服，但已给国家造成损失。
    今年，国务院关于西藏工作的几项决定公布以后，我区僧俗各界人民都表示热烈拥护和积极促使其彻底实现。
    今后，根据我区工作实际情况，努力贯彻第一个五年计划的“增加生产，厉行节约”精神，进一步地加强民族间与民族内部的团结，提高人民群众的爱国主义觉悟水平，努力做好社会治安工作。在此基础上，逐步发展牧业、农业生产为全区中心任务，相应地指导商业、手工业的发展，推进文化教育、医疗卫生工作，并根据实际需要与可能，再建设一些小型工业。各项工作中的一项重要环节是，培养藏族的政治工作干部和技术干部，为将来成立统一的西藏自治区，发展藏族人民经济、文化创造条件。
    我热烈欢迎伟大的第一个五年计划的编制成功，并为其全部实现而贡献我的一切力量。
    裔式娟代表的发言
    我是国营上海第二棉纺织厂的青年女工。在这次会议上，我听了各位首长的报告，心里真是有说不出的高兴。我对这些报告完全拥护。
    这次会议上就要通过的关于发展国民经济的第
  一个五年计划，规定以发展重工业为中心。要发展重工业，就必需有大量的资金。我们纺织工人要不断提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本，开展以全面节约为中心的劳动竞赛，为祖国建设积累更多的资金。
    两年多来，我们在学习了党在过渡时期的总路线后，建设社会主义的信心更增强了，生产的积极性更提高了。我们小组的工人说：“毛主席给我们订了建设社会主义的大计划，我们就要订出自己的小计划，来保证大计划的实现”，“不能因为一个人完不成计划，影响到大计划。”
    在贯彻第一个五年计划的两年多中，全厂工人热烈开展了劳动竞赛，在生产上获得了显著成绩。我们厂在一九五四年生产成本较计划降低百分之零点八，上缴利润超过计划百分之八点七五；今年第
  一季度，成本计划又降低了百分之三点三三，上缴利润又超过了百分之二点四九。
    我们小组每月制定出了切实可行的竞赛保证条件，认真执行。我们在党的领导下，积极学习政治文化和提高技术水平，组织生产会议，交流经验，并经常进行检查，开展批评与自我批评；同时加强日常生活之间的团结互助，进行家庭访问，互相帮助克服困难；使全组工人积极投入生产，全面地完成了计划。如一九五四年，我们小组的产量超额完成计划百分之零点五以上，皮辊花减少了百分之十六以上，出勤率达到百分之九十九点三五。所以我们小组在一九五三年和一九五四年两次被评选为上海市工业劳动模范的先进小组。
    我们纺织工业当前最大的困难，是原料供应不足。我们纺织工人懂得，在社会主义建设中，多节约一朵棉花，多节约一吋纱，聚集起来，就可以为国家积累大量的资金。因此，我们努力提高技术、改进技术，为不浪费一朵棉花，不浪费一吋纱而进行了一点一滴的节约。目前，我们纺织厂里使用了
  一批黄棉花、剥桃棉，在生产上是有些困难的，我们正在为克服这一困难进行斗争。我们已取得了一些成绩。在这里我谨向农民兄弟辛勤劳动、努力增产对纺织工业的支援致以深厚的感谢，并希望农民兄弟继续努力生产大量的棉花，支援我们。让我们共同为完成五年计划贡献更大的力量。
    为了保证完成和提前完成五年计划，我们必须克服骄傲自满、保守落后的思想。李富春副总理在报告中提到我们上海地区用棉量较低，事实上我们工作中还是存在着很多缺点的，浪费现象也仍很严重。例如，用棉量我们厂就比最先进的厂多，今年第
  一季度我们厂每件三十二支绞纱用棉三百八十五点五二斤，国棉六厂只用三百八十二点九斤，我们一件纱就多用了二点六二斤。如果再努一把力，我们用棉量还能降低。在用电、用机物料方面，有的厂也比我们好。对工人群众的合理化建议还没有积极地有目地的去加以领导。生产计划满足于已得的成就，滋长着“到顶”的思想。在不少工人中也有认为生产比过去好得多了，目前生产任务又不急，闭着眼睛也能完成，因而有的对先进工作法不积极学习，不认真推行。我们小组有的工人每台车皮辊花只出四、五两，有的工人却要出到七、八两。有些工人劳动纪律还有松懈现象；对服从国家调配的思想认识还很不够。我们必须努力克服这些工作上思想上的缺点，进一步发掘潜在力量。
    五年计划将带给全国人民更大的幸福。解放以来，由于党和毛主席的正确领导，在发展生产的基础上，我们的劳动条件和物质文化生活都有了很大的改善。例如，解放前，每逢黄梅天和热天，工人就得在又闷又热的车间里工作，常常有人闷得昏倒。现在，由于政府花钱安装了通风降温设备，改善了劳动条件，热天车间的温度只有华氏八十多度，比外面还凉快，使我们能够在良好的环境中愉快地劳动。我们知道，这一切都是共产党和毛主席给我们带来的。同时，我们必须记得，我们生产上的每一个胜利，都是敌人所仇恨的。我们必须时刻警惕反革命分子的破坏。最近潘汉年和胡风反革命罪行的被揭发，是党和人民的又一个大胜利。我完全拥护常务委员会把潘汉年和胡风两个反革命分子加以逮捕审判的决定。我们全体工人，一定要更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，贡献出我们的一切力量，为完成和提前完成五年计划而奋斗。
    邓初民代表的发言
    我竭诚拥护我们政府首长的各项报告。
    兹谨就李富春副总理报告中“关于培养建设干部问题”联系到知识分子的自我改造来提供一点意见。
    为了把我们祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，需要大量的干部。而培养质量优秀的干部，则是我们知识分子、文教工作者的责任。解放以来，在中国共产党的领导下，知识分子参加了社会主义建设，受到了人民的欢迎。但我们知识分子为着适应国家建设的需要，做好培养干部的工作，就必须在各方面不断努力提高自己。提高自己不是别的，就是不断改造自己。
    五年多来，在中国共产党的领导下，知识分子的自我改造，约可分为三个阶段：这就是通过各项政治运动、通过各种学习，以及通过目前正在进行科学的研究，学术思想批判的阶段来进行自我改造。把改造从政治领域扩展到学术思想领域。
    党与国家团结改造知识分子的政策是有它一定的基础与明确的目标的。
    团结的基础是什么呢？过去是人民政协共同纲领，现在则是人民政协章程总纲中的七项准则和中华人民共和国宪法。改造的目标又是什么呢？这就是：一，必须从思想上明确认识社会主义的政治方向；二，必须逐步树立辩证唯物主义的世界观；三，努力培养共产主义的道德品质。这三者是培养全面发展的建设人材所不可缺少和不可分割的条件，也是胜利地完成第一个五年计划所不可缺少和不可分割的条件。
    五年多来，在中国共产党的领导下，知识分子的自我改造是有成绩的，特别是通过最近对胡风反革命集团的揭露，使我们知识分子受到了一次深刻的阶级斗争教育，明确认识到一系列的政治运动过程，各种学习，批判，斗争过程，都是知识分子最有效的自我改造过程。
    当前除了个别坚决的反革命分子外，大多数知识分子，已不是是否接受改造的问题，而是是否能够联系自己，通过每一具体斗争来进行自我改造的问题。我们改造的首要目标是从思想上明确认识社会主义政治方向。但口头上拥护社会主义政治方向，并不等于在实际行动上也拥护社会主义的各项具体政策。因为社会主义各项具体政策的执行和贯彻，都“将要在一定的程度上改变几万万人民的生活习惯”（李富春副总理报告中语）。例如国家对粮食及其他主要生活资料实行计划收购和计划供应，事实证明这是符合全国人民当前利益和长远利益的重要措施，可是在少数人中已引起假缺粮的叫唤，在知识分子中也有人由于缺乏调查和分析，自觉地或不自觉地受了地主和资产阶级的思想影响而跟着叫唤。甚至对统购统销政策，对国家的其他经济调节，对统计和监督，对社会主义建设的计划性，都采取怀疑和反对的态度。他们夸大缺点，看不见一般情况是好的。这种人尽管口头上拥护社会主义政治方向，实际上是违反社会主义政治方向。
    其次，我们改造的目标是逐步树立辩证唯物主义的世界观。但主观上认为自己业已树立辩证唯物主义世界观，并不等于在实际行动上已消除了唯心主义思想。事实证明，唯心主义世界观还在支配着我们许多人的生活、工作和斗争。许多知识分子还不懂得建设社会主义过程就是阶级斗争过程，不懂得我们正处在阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂的过渡时期，这表现在只顾业务，不问政治，弄不清业务和政治的关系，弄不清各项事件中的政治意义，对谣言不反驳，不追究，对挑拨离间行为，不调查，不研究，甚至对反革命分子的破坏事件一般都认为自然事故。唯心主义的世界观还表现在只顾主观，不顾客观；只看片面，不看全面；只相信自己，不相信群众；因而产生了脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离阶级斗争等非政治倾向。事实上，在任何工作上所犯的错误，如果从其世界观的根源去追究，都是资产阶级思想体系核心唯心主义在作怪。一句话，如果我们不懂得政治就是阶级斗争，不懂得阶级斗争贯串在经济、政治和思想意识等方面的客观规律，不懂得社会发展的客观规律，那末，空口拥护辩证唯物主义世界观的人，并不一定就是从思想上、政治上都接受社会主义改造的人。
    复次，我们改造的目标是努力培养共产主义的道德品质。但口头上高谈共产主义道德品质，并不等于在实际行动上就具有共产主义道德品质。例如有某些教师把对青年学生进行共产主义道德教育的责任，看做是学校行政、党、团、政治课教师、政治辅导处的事情，与一般教师无关。认为教师的责任就是把知识传授给学生，庸俗地把教学工作和道德品质的培养，亦即政治任务对立起来。还有某些教师只知对青年学生提出种种道德要求，但从不考虑自己要以身作则来影响学生的理智、情感、意志，及其他行为。殊不知共产主义道德品质对于今天的每一个人来说，都是异常迫切而严格的，也是多方面的。例如爱祖国，爱劳动，爱科学，爱护公共财产，遵守革命法纪等等。因为共产主义道德是从无产阶级斗争中产生并服从于共产主义事业利益的。共产主义事业，是人类历史上空前伟大的事业，它要求承担这一伟大事业的阶级和人民，具有立场坚定、英勇果敢、自我牺牲和高度的革命纪律性。在我们代表中被揭发出的两个反革命分子——潘汉年、胡风，他们不仅违犯了革命法纪，而且有背于普通为人的道德，这是革命人民所绝不容许的。我们应该一致拥护常务委员会工作报告中关于处理潘汉年、胡风两个反革命分子的英明果断的措施。必须指出，我们知识分子如果认真要向自己和青年一代进行共产主义道德教育，全部问题是要使这种教育和阶级斗争的每一具体步骤结合起来，而不是空口的道德说教。对于任何反革命分子的出现，应该把它提到阶级斗争的原则高度和阶级斗争的规律来分析，而不是从形式逻辑出发，发生怀疑而任意作出种种臆测。否则只有显示出自己在主观上政治水平太低，在客观上违反共产主义道德的总要求和总目标。
    我们知识分子应如何在中国共产党的领导下进行自我改造呢？中心环节是联系自己，要像一个铁面无私的法官一样，通过每一具体斗争，对自己时时刻刻加以审判。首先要问我们在口头上拥护社会主义政治方向是否在实际行动上也拥护社会主义政治方向；其次，要问我们在主观上要求树立辩证唯物主义世界观，是否在客观上不为资产阶级唯心主义所侵蚀、麻醉；复次，要问我们在口头上高谈共产主义道德，是否在实际行动上也符合于共产主义道德。这是我们知识分子在过渡时期全面改造的关键问题，也是胜利地完成第一个五年计划的关键问题。
    社会主义工业化和社会主义改造过程，同时就是全国人民、知识分子全面改造过程，也是一个特殊形式的阶级斗争过程。我保证要在中国共产党与毛主席的领导下，在火热的阶级斗争中不睡觉；在社会主义改造中，努力改造自己；特别要在这决定祖国和后世子孙命运的伟大的毛泽东时代，有我自己身上的一滴血和一滴汗。
    车向忱代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所讲的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，彭德怀副总理所作的“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”和彭真副委员长所作的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”。听到了报告和讨论了五年计划草案以后，我深深地感觉到社会主义社会的远景历历在目，同时，作为一个文教工作者，更感到自己责任的艰巨而光荣。我一定在自己的岗位上坚持不懈地为实现五年计划而奋斗。
    我在辽宁省工作，现在谈谈辽宁省的教育工作问题。全省共有中等学校学生约二十余万、小学生约二百四十万，几年来在学生数量方面的发展是不算少了，在教学质量方面也有一定的提高，应该说成绩是主要的。但从为国家社会主义建设培养全面发展的一代来说，我省的教育工作还存在着问题的。首先就是学生学习负担过重，健康不好。据我所了解的情况，中学学生负担过重，最主要的原因是学生课外作业过多。我问到三个中学学生，据说不论是数学教师、物理教师或化学教师都要给学生留三、四道习题，而所留的习题还不是容易算的，有时选的题目较难。所以不少的学生就吃不消了，他们早起晚睡，中午不休息，星期天都忙的不休，结果没有星期天只有星期七。这种严重现象虽然是个老毛病，但始终没有很好的纠正过来。学生们在学校只能死读硬背硬记，甚至个别学生躺在被窝里还背书。这样一来，年轻轻的学生搞的神经衰弱起来，甚至有的还得了肺病。我们应该遵照教育部指示，减轻中小学学生过重的负担，使学生学习得更好。
    其次，中等学校政治教育还很弱。有的教师仍然存在着不注重思想教育“管教不管导”，“教书不教人”的偏向，这就是说，他们还受着资产阶级教育思想的恶劣影响，有的则是贪图安逸，怕麻烦，觉得多一事不如少一事，没有树立人民教师的责任心。须知在过渡时期阶级斗争异常剧烈，资产阶级腐朽思想对青年不断侵蚀的情况下，提高学生的道德品质是颇不容易的一件事，教员不爱管学生，就等于让他们接受不良影响。因此，在某些学校的部分学生中道德品质不好，打架、骂人、偷东西、不爱护公物等都有所发现，在学习时代如此，如不加以教育改正，长大了他们也将不能成为一个勤劳守法积极参加社会主义建设的公民。当然大多数青年学生都是热爱祖国，努力学习，活泼可爱的，我们的任务就在于不满足于这个大多数，而是要积极工作耐心教育，培养整个新的一代能够继承建设祖国的伟大事业。
    再次，是高小和初中毕业学生参加劳动生产的问题。今年辽宁省约有几十万高小毕业生和几万初中毕业生。预计一部分升学而外，还有大部分高小、初中毕业生将参加劳动生产或组织自学。本来，大批具有一定文化知识和怀抱建设祖国热情的青少年参加生产，为工农业各方面增加一批生力军，是一件大事，而我们国家培养青年的目的也就是为了使他们或早或迟地用自己的劳动参加祖国的建设。因此，高小和初中毕业生的绝大部分参加生产，这是正常的现象，就是苏联中小学毕业的学生主要地也是参加生产。但根据几年来的情况看，还不能说没有问题。我认为学校必须加强与家长的联系，共同对毕业学生讲清道理，现在升学将来再参加建设和不升学现在就参加建设，只要为祖国而积极地创造性劳动，都是光荣的。同时，我认为我们各级人民代表大会代表都有责任转移社会上残留的轻视劳动的风气，而热情鼓励青年们用自己的双手创造国家的伟大前途和自己的幸福。
    最后，必须更进一步发挥人民教师的模范作用。我记得某小学有个老教师，他对于学校非常爱护，一草一木他都关心，他又能想办法给学校创造些游戏用具。有一深夜大雪，他在睡梦中想到学校有个土筐丢在院里，他挺身外出，遍寻未得，回屋后，惦念土筐不能安眠。待到天明，他所培养的学生跑回学校向他说：“我昨天夜里回校把土筐已经拾起来了，怕被雪埋上”。这一段故事看来是个很平常的，但这生动地说明了有爱护学校公物的先生，就能教育出同样的学生来。这也说明教员的一举一动、
  一言一行，都要特别注意，都要给学生作个好榜样。我诚挚地希望全国中、小学教师能以身作则，为我们伟大的祖国培养全面发展的社会主义建设的新人。我相信，在伟大的五年计划建设的鼓舞下，我们一定能够取得更大的成绩。
    董其武代表的发言
    听了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，我感到无比的兴奋。根据第一个五年计划，我们要集中主要力量进行工业建设，特别是重工业建设，以建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础；发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，并发展手工业生产合作社，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；基本上把资本主义工商业分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。我认为这是一个伟大的计划，是初步的而又是从根本上改变我国经济面貌的计划，是中国共产党、毛主席根据马克思列宁主义学说，结合我国的具体情况拟定的创造性的计划，是我国建设社会主义社会的重大步骤，是全国各族人民的共同愿望。因此，我衷心热烈地拥护，并愿尽最大努力为完成这个计划而奋斗。
    李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告指出，一九五四年国家预算是在我国国民经济逐渐高涨的前提下实现的。预算执行的结果又帮助了国民经济的发展。一九五五年国家预算支出的首要任务是根据发展国民经济的计划，保证发展重工业，并相应地发展轻工业、农业、交通运输业和文化教育事业。这说明我们国家的预算是保证国民经济建设计划实现的预算，是为人民创造幸福生活的预算，我完全拥护并建议大会予以
  通过。
    社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是优先发展重工业。因为有了重工业，才能制造现代化的工业设备；才能为农业机械化创造物质、技术条件；才能使社会生产不断的扩大，人民生活不断提高；才能使我们军队的装备进一步改善，祖国国防进一步巩固；正如毛主席所指出的：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”因此我们认为实现社会主义工业化，是全国人民最高的利益。有人认为我们有兄弟国家的帮助，可以先发展轻工业，或者是重工业与轻工业并重，以迅速提高人民生活。这种看法是错误的。因为我们一刻也不能忘记，我们还处在凶恶的帝国主义的包围中，不实行社会主义工业化，不优先发展重工业，就不仅不能使我国建成社会主义社会，并且有使我国不能抵御帝国主义的侵略，不能保持经济上和政治上的独立的危险。当然更谈不到改善或提高人民的生活。我们清楚地认识到，人民经济建设愈高涨，国内外的敌人愈要千方百计的来破坏。因此，我国的社会主义建设事业，必须在巩固的国防保卫下来进行，而要建立巩固的国防，就必须优先发展重工业。只有建立起强大的重工业，我们才能制造现代化的武器，来装备保卫祖国的战士，使我们的国防更加巩固，和平更有保障。
    我们能够进行有计划的社会主义经济建设是得来不易的，回想我国百年来受尽帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义残酷的压迫剥削，特别是蒋介石二十年来的反动统治，穷凶极恶的掠夺人民，使广大劳动人民终岁勤劳，不得一饱。只有在工人阶级的先锋队——伟大的中国共产党、毛主席领导下，全国人民经历了几十年的艰苦斗争，才推翻了反动统治，解放了全国大陆。仅仅经过三年的经济恢复，于一九五三年我国已经开始了伟大的第一个五年计划的经济建设。全国人民的物质文化生活不断得到改善，我国国际地位空前提高，成为亚洲和世界和平的有力支柱。真是使人出于至诚地感谢中国共产党和人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。
    第一个五年计划的顺利实现，是工农业各个战线上工作者的光荣责任，也是我们人民解放军每一个指战员的光荣责任。我们应以高度的警惕，注视着敌人，保卫祖国国防、保卫祖国的社会主义建设；同时，在全军之内，必须厉行节约，爱护武器弹药，爱护装备器材，爱护马骡车辆，爱护国家资财；努力训练，积极学习苏联先进经验，提高社会主义觉悟，提高军事技术水平，把我军建设成为一支现代化的、优良的革命军队，随时准备对敢于侵犯祖国的敌人以致命的打击。
    同时我们知道，我们祖国神圣领土台湾，仍在美帝国主义包庇下为蒋介石卖国集团所窃踞，台湾八百万同胞仍在水深火热中，台湾一日不解放，中国人民解放事业一日没有完成；台湾一日不解放，祖国国防一日不安宁；为了台湾八百万同胞，为了巩固祖国国防，为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，中国人民一定要解放台湾，也一定有力量解放台湾。

    中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，充分体现了全国各族人民长期以来的共同愿望。我们有了这个计划和保证这个计划的实现，就可以为我们社会主义工业化奠定初步基础，就可以顺利地进行社会主义改造事业，就可以在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民的物质文化生活。五年计划中并根据各少数民族地区的具体不同情况和条件，规定了在工业、农业、铁路、公路和卫生、文化等事业方面进行建设，这将促进我们少数民族地区经济、文化的进一步发展。我感到非常兴奋。我完全同意发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和一九五四年国家决算、一九五五年国家预算，并同意李富春、李先念副总理的两个报告。听了彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告及彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我完全拥护。
    从一九五三年开始有计划的经济建设以来，国家在各方面取得了伟大成绩。为了胜利完成以社会主义工业化为中心的第一个五年计划，我们就必须从各方面进行艰巨的工作。从贵州情况来说，首先我们必须集中主要力量搞好农业生产，积极发展农业生产合作社，进一步开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，大力增产粮食和工业原料，积极支援国家社会主义工业化的建设。为了保证国家五年计划建设的粮食供应，除了大力增产粮食而外，必须继续贯彻粮食的计划收购和计划供应政策。两年来国家已经实行的粮食统购统销政策和“三定”措施，是完全正确的。由于这个政策的实施，保证了城乡粮食供应和市场物价的稳定，提高了农民的增产积极性，促进了农业互助合作的发展，支援了国家工业化建设，进一步巩固了工农联盟，对于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的顺利进行，起到了很大作用。但是我们过去执行国家统购统销政策，在工作上是有缺点的。贵州省有些地区重统购轻统销，未及时作好供应工作，宣传政策不深不透，对缺粮情况不摸底，群众一叫缺粮，就轻易发给了购粮条子，缺粮少的多供应了，不缺粮的也供应了。实际上，绝大多数叫缺粮的并不是真正缺粮。如毕节县福集、杨菁两乡闹缺粮的四百四十户中，真正缺粮的仅三十五户，占叫缺粮户的百分之八，经过“三定”措施的宣传、贯彻实行和认真整顿了粮食供应工作，使真正缺粮的得到了及时供应，不缺粮而闹缺粮的受到了教育，结果不仅保证了供应，并大大减少了粮食供应数字三万六千多斤。经过粮食统销工作的整顿，不仅保证了供应，节约了粮食，同时提高了农民的生产积极性。如黄平县苗族聚居的东坡乡互助合作运动已有很大发展，参加互助合作运动的农户已占全乡总农户的百分之八十八点二，群众生产情绪很高，开垦荒地，改土变田，兴修水利，提高耕种技术，使用改良农具，增施肥料，实行田边种豆、土边种瓜，保证完成今年农业增产任务。贵州省城市粮食供应工作，过去是偏宽了，供应制度不严，节约粮食的宣传教育不够深入，以致机关、团体、厂矿、企业、学校及城市居民浪费粮食的现象严重，在整顿后，可节约大批粮食。贵州省少数民族地区的浪费也是很大的，据一个小乡的统计，一九五四年吃牯?，杀去耕牛四十二头、猪一百六十头、鸭一千只，大米做酒六千斤，共合八千四百元，约合稻谷二十一万斤；如以每人四百五十斤计算，可供四百六十七人的全年生活。以上情况，充分说明，做好粮食统购统销工作，纠正浪费现象，不仅能够保证粮食供应，并可节余粮食，积累资金。我们必须认真克服这些缺点，贯彻执行国家粮食统购统销政策，保证五年计划的顺利进行。
    五年计划的实施，毫无疑问，全国各族人民都是非常兴奋的，但是反革命分子是不高兴的，他们必然会对五年计划进行各种阴谋破坏。从目前反革命分子的活动来看，是很猖獗的，在城市和农村不断发生行凶、纵火、抢劫、杀害、破坏生产、破坏中心工作等事件。据贵州省贵定、息烽、罗甸、惠水等五县材料，四月十五、十六两天，被反革命分子纵火烧了一百八十多户、四百六十余间房屋，损失约达十余万元，并烧死八人，烧伤二十五人。最近贵州省台江县少数民族地区并发生了土匪抢劫合作社、仓库，杀害区乡干部的事件，其中被害的有三个苗族干部。这些充分说明了反革命分子是我们各族人民建设社会主义的死敌。全国人民代表大会常务委员会依照宪法第三十七条的规定，批准将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判，是完全正确的。过去我们警惕性不高，有太平麻痹思想，群众已有意见，说我们对反革命分子太宽大了。必须看到，敌人必然要用各种卑鄙无耻的办法来破坏五年计划的，我们必须提高警惕，坚决肃清一切反革命分子，才能保障五年计划的胜利执行。
    五年计划的彻底实现是很艰巨的，我们要从各方面加倍地努力学习、努力工作，保证贯彻执行。我相信，全国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，国家的五年计划是一定能够胜利完成的。
    金白山代表的发言
    我衷心地拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。
    全国各族人民的共同的最大的愿望，是把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国。第一个五年计划是实现这一愿望的重大步骤，它是一个引导我国沿着社会主义道路前进，使我国繁荣富强和人民幸福的伟大计划。它给全国各族人民指明了实现这一愿望的具体做法，因此，我国各族人民都热烈地拥护这一计划。有了这个计划，就更增强了全国各族人民建设祖国、保卫祖国、保卫和平的信心和决心。
    我是一个集体农庄的农民，从我亲身经历的感觉来说，我们农民要最后摆脱贫穷和痛苦，就必须离开过去长期所走惯了的小生产的旧道路，而转向集体化和机械化的社会主义农业的新道路。农业的大规模的集体化特别是机械化，若是没有国家重工业的发展是不能设想的。因此，第一个五年计划中写出了以发展重工业为中心的社会主义工业化的方针，这是完全正确的。
    我们星火集体农庄，在共产党和人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，按着互助合作运动的方向，几年来由一个四户的互助组逐渐发展到一百三十户的集体农庄。组织起来后粮食生产是逐年地增长着；在组织互助组的第一年，即一九四八年，我们耕种了一百二十亩地，每个劳动力平均十五亩地，虽然起早贪黑地干活，产量比单干时有所增加，但每亩产量仅仅是三百一十七斤水稻。此后经过两年的努力，生产有了发展，到一九五一年，组织了集体农庄，耕种了一千四百二十五亩地，每个劳动力平均三十一亩多，共收了八十四万四千四百五十五斤水稻，每亩平均收了五百九十二斤多。一九五二年的产量也有所增加，到了一九五三年种三千亩地，共收了二百二十六万二千斤，平均每亩收了七百五十四斤。去年全庄一百二十一户，扩大耕地面积到六千三百亩，每个劳动力平均三十七亩多，虽在受灾面积达百分之二十的情况下，每亩平均还收了六百七十斤水稻，共收了四百二十二万一千斤，卖给国家三百零四万斤。
    我们能够多打粮食的主要原因是：组织起来后发挥了集体劳动的潜在力量，按照各人劳动的所长合理分工，实行了定额管理，计件包工，避免了窝工浪费的现象；使用马拉农具和拖拉机进行全部干播，增施了化学肥料，并由于国家拖拉机站给耕地和抽水站的合理灌溉，保证了旱时不缺水，涝时排出水去，因而增产了粮食。
    随着生产的发展，我们的生活也得到了逐步的改善。几年来庄员的收入提高了三倍多，在互助组的时候每个劳动日的收入仅仅是一元二角八分，现在是五元。每个男庄员一年平均收入一千三百五十元，最高达一千八百二十五元。女庄员除进行家务劳动外，平均收入四百五十元左右，最高也达一千零三十五元。我们全村学龄儿童已全部入学，并有高中学生六名，初中学生十八名，庄里还有农民业余学校，学习文化和农业知识。并有业余剧团。自去年以来，参加农庄生产的初中、高小毕业生就有二十多名，成为农庄生产上的有力助手，不仅生产积极而且在各方面工作中，他们都是活动分子，颇受人们的喜爱。不仅是我们星火集体农庄生产发展的这样快，生活这样好，而且附近的其他五个集体农庄的生产和生活也和我们差不多。这充分表明了集体化、机械化的优越性。
    在继续扩大再生产并照顾到生活的适当改善的情况下，我们已积累了二十万元公积金投入了生产。为了发挥妇女的劳动能力，设立托儿所，受托一百多个幼儿，并积极地创造条件来减轻妇女的家庭负担，使之多参加劳动生产。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。在实现第一个五年计划中农民所担负的责任是重大的光荣的。第一个五年计划要求农民增加粮食产量百分之十七点六。我们星火集体农庄有决心和信心和全国农民一道保证完成和超额完成这一光荣任务。为了完成和超额完成这一光荣任务，我们必须纠正个别庄员对公共财物爱护不够和现在生产定额管理中的某些不合理的现象，提高领导水平，严格防止骄傲自满情绪的产生，努力学习各地先进经验，在农业生产上采取有效地切合实际的增产措施，提高单位面积产量，扩大开荒面积，发挥庄员的劳动生产积极性，努力完成和超额完成今年我们农庄的四百六十万斤生产任务和卖给国家三百二十万斤粮食，来支援国家的工业建设。我们更要百倍地提高革命警惕性，坚决防止和肃清反革命分子的破坏活动，和全国人民一起，在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，竭尽全力，谦虚谨慎，克勤克俭，兢兢业业，为实现并争取早日实现我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而努力奋斗！
    韩望尘代表的发言
    我完全同意和热烈拥护李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”及邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，并在今后实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“五年内资本主义工商业将经过公私合营、加工订货、代销经销等等方式，而被逐步地纳入国家资本主义的轨道，为私营工商业的社会主义改造建立基础。”这是完全正确的、必要的和可能的。如西安市，现代化的资本主义工业，已基本进入高级的国家资本主义形式；私营工业与手工业一九五四年接受国家加工订货的产值，已占其全部产值的百分之六十四点五七；这些企业，一经公私合营后，就能逐渐改变资本主义经营的盲目性和无政府状态，并能按国家计划和人民需要，不断改进经营，提高生产，真正做到对国计民生有益，对资本家有利。如西安市大华纺织厂，公私合营后即逐渐改变原来资本主义管理方式，职工生产情绪普遍高涨；正布率由公私合营前的百分之八十六点七，上升到百分之九十七点七；二十一支纱的单位成本比公私合营前降低百分之二十点八五；并已能逐月全面完成国家计划，利润也比原来有所增加。在商业方面：西安市的批发商一九五四年经过辅导转业的占原来总户数的百分之六十七点三七；全省为国营和合作社营商业进行代销、经销的私营零售商，也在不断地增加，这样业务有了很大变化，销售额也有显著增长。如渭南食品杂货业实行经销后的零售额比经销前上升百分之三十六以上，国药业上升了百分之四十二以上。这就扭转了他们思想上长期存在的工业有办法、商业无办法和大的有办法、小的无办法等等的错误认识。同时，对于不能继续经营者的从业人员都作了安置，使他们得到出路。一年来，西安市业经有关机关积极负责的、按政策法令和本人自愿原则分别安置的店员和资方实职人员，已达需要安置的四千九百多人的百分之九十五以上；一些能力较高、表现较好的资方实职人员，都担任了相当重要的职务；其余人员正在训练和继续安置中。这对于私营工商业者又是一次极深刻的教育。因而很多人反映：“这一下心先不慌了，不再盲目乱碰了，把过去认为自己没有盘缠，走不到社会主义的顾虑打消了。”并都体会到，只要自己诚心诚意地接受社会主义改造，就一定有路可走，可以走向社会主义社会。
    但今后在改造的过程中，私营工商业者还会发生新的顾虑。而少数落后分子更可能抗拒、破坏改造。事实上，目前在安排改造中，就有一些私商仍不了解安排改造的重要意义，错误地认为总路线闭了门，行不通了。即在成绩较好的公私合营企业中，也有少数资方或资方代理人满足现有成绩，只和私营时的落后情况比，很少和先进的企业比。至于抽逃资金，挥霍浪费，投机取巧等恶劣情况仍迭有发生；偷税漏税的情况也相当严重。西安市一九五四年查获的偷税漏税案，即达八千七百九十九件；税款达一百四十多万元。这即可说明对资本主义工商业的改造，是个长期的细致的教育过程和复杂的尖锐的斗争过程。必须不断地进行教育和斗争，才能把对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作逐步完成。
    上述许多问题的存在和产生，是和我们工作中的缺点和错误分不开的，今后要努力加以克服和纠正。我们陕西省工商联工作人员，必须认识自己的责任重大，应大力配合与协助政府宣传国家的政策法令和国家发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，深入了解分析工商界的意见和要求，帮助他们克服困难，积极进行改造；尤应动员正当工商业者向一切抗拒和破坏社会主义改造的违法行为作坚决斗争。并希望我们一切私营工商业者要看清社会主义的光明前途，诚心诚意地接受社会主义改造；必须认识资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是我国第一个五年计划的重要组成部分，也是我们一项光荣任务。我们应信心百倍地继续努力，来完成这个任务。
    最后，还应指出：在进行建设的同时，一切爱国的私人工商业者必须继续提高警惕，严防反革命分子特别是暗藏在工商业者内部的反革命分子和坚决反抗社会主义改造的分子的造谣破坏。最近胡风反革命集团的事件，即是一个极深刻的教训。我建议政府对胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子坚决进行镇压，以保证五年计划的贯彻执行。
    我们相信：在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，任何困难都不能丝毫动摇我们的信心，任何敌人都不能破坏我们的正义事业。让我们遵照毛主席的指示，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，为实现使我国迈向繁荣幸福的第一个五年计划而努力吧！
    童第周代表的发言
    中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，即将在这个大会上通过，这是我国进行伟大的社会主义建设事业中，一件极其重要的事件。这个计划的实现，将开始改变我国百年来经济落后的面貌，建立起社会主义建设的初步基础。在实现五年计划的斗争中，每一个人民，不论他站在那一个岗位上，都应当争取完成和超额完成他的工作任务。作为一个高等教育和科学研究工作者，我认为，在目前的情况下，要更好地完成我们五年计划中第八章所规定的培养建设干部和加强科学研究工作的任务，应当注意到下面几个问题：
    第一、教学计划的制定问题。解放以来，全国高等教育经过恢复整理和教师的思想改造运动以后，已进到学习苏联先进经验、改革教育制度、调整院系、制定教学计划的阶段了。教学计划的制定，最重要的是要切合我国的实际情况。因此在制定教学计划以前，必须经过实地调查，搜集有关教学的具体资料，分析整理，参考苏联的先进经验，作出切实可行的方案，再经多方讨论补充修正后，提付初步施行。如果忽略了目前的具体情况，或没有经过详细的、全面的讨论，就容易脱离实际，这样的教学计划，在实施的过程中就会遇到很多的困难，到了那个时候，再考虑修正，势必使教学工作受到很大的损失。当然教学计划的制定，不可能一下子就完美无缺，但也不应改变太多。因各高等学校为了执行和贯彻一个新的教学计划，须经过一系列的准备过程，如全体教师对计划内容多次的学习和讨论，课程的更改，师资的调配，教学大纲的修正，讲义的改编等等。因此一次教学计划的改变，在具体工作上，必须有一二年的布置时间，方能大致就绪。如果改变太多，势必造成教学上的忙乱现象，这不但不能提高教学质量，就连经常的教学工作也很难维持。所以教学计划的制定，必须经过仔细思考和讨论，务使切合实际才可。
    第二、教育单位、企业单位和科学研究单位的联系合作问题。目前我国的师资和科学研究人员不论在数量上和质量上都不能满足我们的需要。为了完成本单位的工作任务，争用师资和科学技术人员，成为各单位间最普遍的现象。要解决这个问题，培养新干部，当然是最基本的办法，但各单位间工作上的密切合作，也是解决干部缺乏、保证工作完成的重要环节之一。以科学研究工作来讲，如仅靠科学研究机构中的几千人来担负这项艰巨的工作，能力和成效到底是有限的。全国高等学校现共有专任教师三万八千多人，再加上厂矿中的专业人员，数量是很可观的。我们如果能够把他们很好地组织起来，扩大科学研究工作的队伍，配合国家建设，有计划地来进行研究工作，这对中国科学的发展，一定能起很大的作用。在另一方面，各研究机构和厂矿部门的专门人员，都是国内的优秀科学工作者，如果能够分担一部分教学工作，不但能解决高等学校中不少的开课问题，并能使课程内容更好地结合实际，协助各校学科提高教育质量。教学和研究本来是一个不能分割的整体，我们希望高等教育部、科学研究机构和有关的企业部门共同协商，订出一个具体合作办法，这是非常必要和急需的。
    第三、是时间的节约问题。关于节约问题，在李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告中，都有详细的说明，各小组会上也作了深刻的讨论。但一般注意的是人力、物力和财力的节约，对时间的节约注意的还是很少。其实时间也是一切工作中重要因素之一，任何工作的进行与成就，是不能离开时间来估计的。以科学研究工作来讲，所有发现和发明，并不同“拾黄金”一样，机会凑巧，偶然的获得。它是经过多年钻研，在资料和时间的积累下逐渐滋长出来的。教学工作也是一样，一个担任教学工作的人，如果没有时间看书，如何能够完成他的教学任务，提高他的教学质量呢？这并不是说从事教学工作和科学研究工作的人，应当埋头钻研业务，不必关心政治和国家的建设事业，相反的他们必须积极参加一定的社会政治运动，来提高自己的政治思想水平。但如果因活动或其他的事务过多，影响了他的基本任务，那是不妥当的。所以我觉得目前从事教学工作和科学研究工作的人，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时期，应有下列三种要求：（一）要加强马克思列宁主义的学习来奠定他的思想理论基础；（二）要适当地参加社会政治运动，来提高他的政治觉悟；（三）要有充分的时间来进行他的业务工作。关于时间问题，在去年全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，已有几位代表提出过。但具体情况，一年来似乎没有改变得很多，我们希望各方负责人员对这个问题能够重视起来，使时间的节约，在厉行节约运动中与人力、物力、财力的节约一样，能够得到全面的开展。
    张含英代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告。我想就有关治理黄河问题，发表一点意见。
    根治黄河，是我们祖先几千年来所追求的理想，是全国六万万人民迫切的希望。现在，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，根治黄河的工作就要开始了，这是我国经济建设事业上又一个重大的事情，它将从根本上改变黄河流域的自然面貌，它将为我国走向社会主义社会、共产主义社会创造有利的条件。
    黄河流域是我国古代经济、文化的孕育地；它有着肥沃的土壤，早在“禹贡”这本书上就作了很高的评价；它有着丰富的水源，兰州以上的流域面积虽仅占全流域的三分之一，而全年的水流却占入海总量的十分之七；它有着雄伟的形势，发源于海拔四千多公尺的高源，流经群山，沿河山谷有着为修建水库的优良地形和地质条件；它是宋朝以前历代首都所在地；它为历代的诗人歌手所吟咏高唱。但是由于黄河在自然方面的不利条件和反动统治阶级的不关心人民生活，不事治理，甚或破坏水利，遂使黄河在过去经常发生灾害，在三千多年间，黄河下游决口泛滥的记载有一千五百多次，大改道迁移二十六次。因此，黄河便蒙了“败家子”的恶名。
    历代黄河流域的广大人民通过和洪水的顽强斗争，不断丰富着治河的经验，创造了许多优良的治河方法，保障了农业生产。但是这种防灾工作，只限于下游大平原，仅能防御于为患的形势已成以后，所以黄河终不得根治。现在的治理计划是从根本着手，不只要改变黄河在自然方面的不利条件，而且要开发它的资源，来为人民服务，不但要消除水患的威胁，而且根据国民经济发展计划从事水流和土地的充分利用。这个计划使我们完全改变了对于黄河的认识，从“祸害”变为“利源”。同时在治理的方法上，把“除害”和“兴利”统一处理，解决了过去孰先孰后的争论。
    在兴利的各方面，用水的要求也是不一致的。例如水能利用和灌溉农田就存在着矛盾。水能利用并不消耗水，水流经过上游的发电站以后，除蒸发、渗漏的损失以外，到下边的发电站仍可使用，可以一级一级地直用到海口。可是灌溉要消耗水量，水到田地以后，基本上不再回入河道。可见要多发电，灌溉就要相应地减少，要多灌溉，发电就得减少。即专就灌溉用水说，也有上下游的矛盾。设若上游灌溉面积大了，下游灌溉面积就要相应地减少，反转来说情况也是一样。这只是两个例子，自然还有其它的矛盾。这些矛盾在封建社会和资本主义社会里是不可能得到解决的，而在治理黄河规划里都得到了正确的解决。
    现在根据技术上的可能性和经济上的合理性，把各个方面的要求都作了妥善的安排。因为只有在优越的人民民主专政制度的基础上，才能发挥技术上最大的作用，才能最完善地利用自然条件，才能用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全。
    这个计划不只给我们描绘了一幅美丽的远景，而且根据全面的规划和当前的迫切需要，安排了第一期工程。第一期工程就是黄河综合开发的第一步。在通过这个决议以后，蓝图就要变为现实，黄河流域的水流和土地资源，就要在经济建设的各方面为人民服务了，这是何等令人兴奋激动的大事！
    有些资本主义国家的工程师竟妄说二千年后黄河流域就要变成一片沙漠，这完全是诬蔑，完全不了解人民的力量。我们不只不会让它变成沙漠，而且要黄河变清，要黄土高原变为葱茂的森林、丰产的农田，黄河将永绝水患，黄河将给我们带来大量而廉价的电力，推动工业的发展，灌溉亿万亩农田，增加农业的生产，开辟几千里的航道，畅通轮船的交通。黄河流域将要变得风调雨顺，美丽富饶。现在就是这个伟大的改造自然工作的开始！
    我从初次到黄河上作调查研究工作，到现在整整三十年了。我在黄河上走过不少地方，也写过不少关于黄河的文章，我梦寐以求的是根治黄河的开端。但是在黑暗的反动统治时代，这只是幻想。只有在中国共产党领导人民革命胜利以后，人民作了国家的主人，才能制定为改进人民生活的经济计划，才能逐步建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。我坚决响应李富春副总理的号召，为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的任务而奋斗！
    沙汀代表的发言各位代表：
    我热诚拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。在小组讨论中，我一直非常兴奋，因为我更加深切地感觉到，“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”
    现在我想向大会谈一谈胡风反革命集团的问题。这里首先要说明的，在人民日报揭露这个反革命集团的第一批材料后，四川各界人民非常愤怒。四川省人民委员会跟即召开了一次扩大会议，一致决议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格，要求政府依法严惩。同时大家对于这个反革命集团在四川解放前后的罪恶活动，也开始有了广泛的揭发和进一步的认识。
    抗日战争时期，作为蒋介石国民党反革命的别动队，胡风反革命集团就对革命做了不少破坏活动。他们担负着蒋介石国民党思想方面的反革命任务。他们在四川出版的各种刊物，斗争锋芒一直是指向中国共产党、指向人民和一切进步力量的，他们采取各种隐蔽破坏方式为蒋介石效劳，而且达到了蒋介石用公开反革命手段所不能达到的反革命的目的。譬如，国民党反动派不准作家讽刺、暴露他们反动政权的腐朽黑暗，胡风则咒骂讽刺、暴露反动派黑暗统治的作家所干的工作为“搅大粪的工作”。在反动派的禁令无法阻止讽刺、暴露作品的流传时，而胡风则向这些作品进行攻击。这样，就使得文艺界和知识分子思想上发生过较长时期的混乱，受到不少损失。更可恶的是他们一贯向共产党和革命“争取”青年，替反动派招兵买马。当时很多青年因为向往光明，向往革命，不惜冒生命危险到延安去，蒋介石特别在西安建立了一座集中营来拘禁他们。而胡风集团分子则大肆宣传“那里有生活，那里有斗争”的反动理论，使得不少青年放弃了到延安去的计划。人们说得对，胡风反革命集团的刊物，是蒋介石建立的另一座集中营。
    抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派发动内战的卖国行为遭受到全国人民的反对，他们一切反革命的叫嚣遭受到全国人民的唾弃，这时胡风反革命集团办了许多刊物为蒋介石的反革命事业摇旗呐喊。因此解放战争期间，胡风反革命集团分子在四川出版的“呼吸”、“脉搏”、“突击”、“荒鸡小集”、
  “奔星小业”等，在进步的伪装下，对于中国共产党所领导的革命运动和文艺运动的进攻，比以往更疯狂了。譬如，一九四七年正是蒋介石反动政权崩溃的前夕，全国人民，特别是青年学生纷纷起来进行
  “反饥饿，反内战，反迫害”的斗争，迎接解放。但是胡风反革命集团却针对这一斗争，宣传什么
  “要我辈凡人去革命，我就得首先想，自己是不是不革命就活不下去？倘若并不如此，我决不去替人哭丧”！宣传什么“要忍受一切饥寒病危的痛苦，监视流离的痛苦，死亡的痛苦”，阻止人们参加到反美蒋的斗争中去。当着这些反动的宣传也不能阻止人们参加反美蒋的斗争时，他们竟疯狂地使用两面派的手法，利用广大青年对国民党、三青团的憎恨，无耻地诬蔑当时中国共产党所领导的轰轰烈烈的学生运动为“少数太热心的青年”在三青团的打手们迷惑下的“游行请愿”，直接进行破坏。
    根据四川重庆、成都很多青年揭发和控诉的材料，胡风反革命集团毒害青年的情形，是十分严重的。他们总是想尽一切方法接近青年，特别是爱好文艺的青年，以扩大他们的“群众基础”。单以成都而论，从一九四○年到一九四九年底，由他们组织的文艺团体，以及本来由进步青年所组成，在他们钻进去之后加以操纵和影响的文艺团体，就在十五个以上。此外他们还组织了不少“读书会”、“联欢会”，对青年进行毒害。他们利用青年对当时现状的不满，而大肆宣传“主观战斗精神”和“原始生命力”，有意使某些幼稚无知的青年任性地发泄其个人主义。结果，凡是受到他们毒害的青年，一个个变得狂妄自大，仇视集体，有的竟被拉入反革命的泥沼！胡风反革命集团骨干分子罗洛，就是他们一手这样“培养”出来的一个“代表人物”。
    解放以后，我们所知道的胡风分子纷纷离开四川，这使我们在运动初期估计错误，以为四川没有什么胡风分子了。事实证明不是这样。因为胡风分子已经侵入革命阵营的各个方面，但不一定是知名之士。单拿胡风分子冯异说吧，他就是一个剧团资料室的普通工作人员，文艺界当然不大注意，但他却对重庆文艺界进行了很多破坏活动。首先他在四川人民艺术剧院内部拉拢一些思想作风、政治历史有问题的人，组织成小圈子，兴风作浪，企图搞垮剧院的乐队；同时还在剧团外面联系了一批失业学生，一贯污蔑破坏中国共产党和人民政府的威信。所以胡风对他很看重，经常亲自写信向他发号施令，把他作为“联络人，争取人”的一个据点。由此可见，胡风反革命集团的反革命活动真是无孔不入。事实证明，胡风一九五一年到四川参加土改时，不仅公开宣传过他的反动思想，还干了不少“联络人，争取人”的勾当。
    应当说，在四川进行的肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争，是十分剧烈的。热忱拥护中国共产党、拥护社会主义事业的广大人们，都已经积极参加到这一斗争中来了。而另一方面，不少反革命分子和对目前社会主义建设和社会主义改造不满的人，则对这一斗争进行种种破坏活动。譬如，在重庆工业系统一个基层单位举行声讨胡风的大会时，一个暗藏的中统特务张稳，竟敢明目张胆地站起来为胡风辩护，并大喊大叫，捣乱会场。由此也可看出，作为一个反革命集团，胡风这一帮匪徒是具有充分代表性的。
    在这一惊心动魄的斗争中，四川的广大干部和群众都受到了深刻的教育，提高了自己对于过渡时期阶级斗争日益尖锐复杂这一问题的认识，弄清楚了以使用两面派手法为其特征的隐蔽的敌人，比拿枪的公开的敌人还更危险！为了保卫社会主义事业的胜利进行，大家更一致向中国共产党和人民政府提出了极其严正的要求。在这个庄严的大会上，我有责任重复一遍四川人民一致的呼声：严厉惩办胡风及其骨干分子！把一切暗藏的反革命分子从人民内部清洗出去！
    王亚南代表的发言
    请允许我就我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划发表一点感想。
    听过李富春副总理的报告以后，我们又比较仔细地学习讨论了这个计划的草案；我和其他代表一样，非常兴奋鼓舞地感到，这是继去年大会通过的
  “中华人民共和国宪法”之后的又一个关系全国人民政治生活、经济生活、文化生活的具有决定意义的重要文献。对于这个文献，作为一个全国人民代表大会代表，应该说些什么呢？我是一个经济科学的研究者，对于这个发展国民经济的伟大计划，有什么意见呢？我同时还是一个大学的行政负责人，我将怎样依据这个计划来进行我的工作呢？
    我愿意就这几个方面来谈一谈。
    首先，作为一个全国人民代表大会代表，我是热忱拥护这个计划的。这是因为这个计划所要实现的目的，完全符合全国人民的愿望。没有那一个中国人民不殷切期待国家富强，不希望生活过得更好。而为了使我们这个小农国家变成社会主义工业国家所采行的一切措施，就恰好是满足全国人民的这个愿望。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，不仅明确规定了逐年提高生产力的要求，并也明确地规定了逐年提高人民物质文化生活水平的要求。也许说，在实现计划的过程中，我们是有不少困难的：我们过去的经济太落后，技术水平太低，积累太少；我们的社会经济还存在着许多矛盾的：在国民经济中，资本主义经济还占有相当的比重，在农业经济中，小农经济还占有很大的优势。这一切困难和矛盾，都需要在发展过程中逐步予以克服，需要大家为了长远的福利，在目前付出一些代价，我们中国人民在中国共产党及毛主席的领导下，历经艰难困苦，流血牺牲，赢得了和平民主独立自由生活的今天，大家一定不惜在今天加把劲，出点汗，付出一定代价，争取实现五年计划，争取更美好的明天。
    因此，我以全国人民代表大会代表的资格，坚决拥护这个体现着全国人民的愿望和要求的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    其次，作为一个经济科学研究者，我把这个计划看成是马克思主义的科学范本。它是在历史唯物主义原则指导下，掌握运用了马克思主义政治经济学规律而拟制出来的。绪言说明了计划所由建立的可靠的政治经济的历史基础和施行计划所依据的指导原则。第一章提出了五年计划所要达成的纲领性的任务，第二章则依据所要争取完成的任务，拟订了生产、运输、商品流通等各方面的投资的限额和生产指标，而自第三章以下至第十一章则分别就工业、农业、交通、商业、文教、人民生活福利以及厉行节约、反对浪费等方面规定其具体任务，正确地估计了达成任务的有利条件和不利条件，指出所应采取的必要措施。计划是庞大的，包罗万象的，构成了中国社会经济的百科辞书，然而它是科学的系统的。依照经济现实运动的相互联系及其发展的严格逻辑顺序，掌握运用过渡时期的各种经济法则特别是有计划按比例发展法则的作用，把各个方面，各个步骤，各个环节，系统地组织在一个综合平衡的整体中。计划的说服力和正确性，就是由于它不带一点幻想，完全建立在可靠的事实和坚实的科学论据上面。
    这个计划本身及李富春副总理关于计划的报告，不仅会对中国经济学界发生极大的指导作用，同时，它将和中华人民共和国宪法一样，成为鼓舞全国人民，提高全国人民思想认识水平的重要文件。
    最后，作为一个大学的行政负责人，我认为，这个计划的鼓舞教育力量，应当成为我们进行工作的一大推动力。我是在我国东南国防前线的厦门工作，在经常对敌的斗争中，格外感到政治思想教育工作的重要。我们经常是把国家在各方面斗争的重大成就，把我们广大人民在各种战线上表现的艰苦卓绝的爱国主义英雄事例，拿来鼓舞激励我们全体的教职员工及同学。但尽管如此，我们学校的整个气氛，还是缺乏战争观念，缺乏持久的战斗情绪，太平麻痹思想，警惕性不高，仍是我们工作的重大缺点。这就使我们的思想还落后于现实要求。解放五年多以来，共产党和人民政府为了培养国家建设人材的急迫需要，大力支持改善学校的教育环境和充实教学研究设备，我们学校原来的创办人陈嘉庚先生又协助募建了许多新的房屋，然而正如一位苏联专家看过我们一些高等学校之后所指出的，我们的“设备优于技术，技术优于思想”；倒过来说，就是思想落后于技术，技术落后于设备条件。这在一方面说明高等学校的物力人力有极大的浪费，另一方面说明非社会主义的、资产阶级的观点和思想方法，还在发生有力的影响。在这种的教育气氛中，是很难得培养出合乎社会主义建设要求的干部来的。我们在大学的行政工作者必须在中国共产党的领导下，在全国全面展开揭露一切反革命分子的思想运动中，检查纠正我们自身及工作上存在的缺点和错误，来证示我们在认真为实现五年计划而努力。
