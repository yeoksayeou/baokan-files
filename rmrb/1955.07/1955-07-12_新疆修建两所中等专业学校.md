    Xinjiang Province is constructing two secondary vocational schools to cultivate construction talent for developing the rich resources of both the north and south sides of the Tianshan Mountains. The secondary agricultural and animal husbandry technology school located in Urumqi will train mid-level technical cadres in agriculture, animal husbandry, water conservancy, meteorology, and other fields. This school will enroll its first students in the fall of this year. When fully completed in 1957, it will be able to accommodate more than one thousand students.

    新疆修建两所中等专业学校
    新疆省正在修建两所中等专业学校，为开发天山南北富饶的资源培养建设人材。设在乌鲁木齐市的中等农牧业技术学校，将培养农牧、水利、气象等方面的中等技术干部。这所学校在今年秋季招收第一批学生；到一九五七年全部完工后，可以容纳一千多名学生。建立在喀什市郊的农业、牧业、林业和水利职业学校，将招收四百名到五百名学生。
