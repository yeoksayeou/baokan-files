At 8:00 PM, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, accompanied Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party Truong Chinh, as well as Chairman Mao's close comrades-in-arms, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yun, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Kang Sheng, Dong Biwu, Lin Boqu, Zhang Wentian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Xiaoping, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and members of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Le Van Hien, Phan Anh, Nguyen Van Huyen, Nghiem Xuan Yem, Ung Van Khiem, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Pham Ngoc Thach, Hoang Van Hoan, etc., entered the venue amidst welcoming music.

From the entrance of Zhongshan Park to Zhongshan Hall, on the tree-lined road packed with people, excited people jumped and cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!"

At 8:10 PM, the garden party celebration began. Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho received flowers from children. The kind Chairman Ho Chi Minh hugged and kissed the children who presented the flowers. Chairman Mao talked to the children with a smile.

After the band played the Internationale, Peng Zhen first delivered a speech saying that today is the 34th anniversary of the founding of our Party, and we are holding a garden party here to celebrate. Chairman Mao and other comrades of the Central Committee, as well as many comrades and friends from home and abroad, have also come to celebrate this festival with us.

This year's "July 1st" coincides with the visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh to our country. We warmly welcome respected Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Comrade Truong Chinh, and friends from the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We wish the Vietnamese people victory in their struggle, wish the Vietnamese people go from victory to victory, and strive to develop the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then spoke. He first said in Chinese: Dear Chairman Mao, dear comrades! At this time, people kept cheering: "Long live Chairman Ho!" Then he said in Vietnamese: "First of all, let me, on behalf of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, express my warm gratitude to the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the comrades and friends participating in the garden party!"

"I have been to China before the liberation of China, and I have come to China again after the liberation. The appearance before and after is very different. I have personally seen the great achievements of the Chinese people in building socialism. This achievement is like the achievement of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people and the Labor Party feel very encouraged to see this achievement."

When Chairman Ho Chi Minh spoke, the cheers from the masses gathered in various parts of the park echoed the cheers in the venue, forming a scene of jubilation.

At this time, Zhongshan Park was brightly lit. After Peng Zhen announced the start of the garden party, the green lawn was filled with joyful songs and lively dances.

Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh first watched the performance of the China Acrobatic Troupe in front of Zhongshan Hall. The superb vehicle skills won applause from the audience. Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh entered the Five-Color Altar, a 15th-century building symbolizing our country's vast territory and abundant resources. The Air Force Political Department Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sang "Dear Chairman Ho" and "Great Mao Zedong" and performed Korean Sword Dance and Potato Dance. Each performance received long-lasting cheers from the audience.

Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh were warmly welcomed by the people during their stroll in the garden. They watched the Northeast Yangko Dance and "Pig Bajie Carries His Bride" performed by the China Puppet Theater after leaving the west gate of the altar.

Everywhere, people sang "The East is Red" and "Ode to Chairman Ho", and everywhere people cheered "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live Chairman Ho". After Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh arrived, the actors of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began to perform. The song "Anti-Japanese Expedition Song" rippled through the ancient cypress forest, bringing people's memories back to the years of the Anti-Japanese War. The song reminded people that our Party led the people of the whole country to go from victory to victory through a long and arduous struggle. When Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh arrived in front of Chunming Hall, they watched the Hainan Li children's dance "Playing with Bowls" performed by the China Children's Art Theater. After the performance, the little actor Hu Huiguang happily jumped up and said: "Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh smiled at our performance, how happy!"

Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh came to Xili Pavilion, where they watched the performances of young literary and art workers from Vietnam and China. The program performed by the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe was the folk dance of the Mang and Dai ethnic groups in the northwest region of Vietnam: "Bamboo Dance". This is a dance depicting the scene of a celebration after the victory of the Vietnamese army and people in the war. The performers danced lightly through the bamboo poles that clapped and made sounds. After the performance, Chairman Mao Zedong specifically waved to the Vietnamese dancers to show his regards. Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh then watched the Peking Opera dance "Stopping the Horse at the Pass". Next, Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh watched the Lion Dance and Sword Dance performed by the Political Department Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy.

Wherever Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh went, a climax was set off there. People know that the victory of the Vietnamese people, as well as the struggle of the Vietnamese people for peace and unification, is an important contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh and their close comrades-in-arms left Zhongshan Park at 11:00 PM. At this time, Zhongshan Park was filled with cheers and applause.

The people participating in the garden party will never forget this close relationship between the leaders and the masses, and the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam.

    新华社一日讯　为庆祝中国共产党成立三十四周年和欢迎正在我国访问的越南民主共和国主席、越南劳动党主席胡志明和越南民主共和国政府代表团，今天，中国共产党北京市委员会在中山公园举行了盛大的游园晚会。
    下午八时，中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记彭真和中共北京市委第二书记刘仁陪着毛泽东主席、胡志明主席、越南劳动党总书记长征，以及毛主席的亲密战友、中共中央书记处书记刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、中共中央政治局委员康生、董必武、林伯渠、张闻天、彭德怀、邓小平和越南民主共和国政府代表团团员黎文献、潘英、阮文煊、严春菴、雍文谦、阮维祯、范玉石、黄文欢等在欢迎曲中进入会场。
    从中山公园大门口到中山堂，在挤满人群的林荫道上，激动的人们跳跃着，欢呼着：“毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”
    八时十分，游园庆祝大会开始。毛主席和胡主席接受了少年儿童的献花。慈祥的胡志明主席抱着献花的孩子吻了又吻。毛主席含笑和孩子们谈话。
    乐队奏完国际歌，彭真首先致词说，今天是我们党成立的三十四周年纪念，我们在这里举行游园大会庆祝。毛主席和中央其他同志，以及国内和国外的许多同志们和朋友们也来和我们一块欢度这个节日。
    今年“七一”，欣逢以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团来我国访问，我们热烈地欢迎敬爱的胡志明同志、长征同志和越南民主共和国政府代表团的朋友们。我们祝越南人民斗争胜利，祝越南人民从胜利走向胜利，为发展中越人民的友谊而努力。
    胡志明主席接着讲话。他首先用中国话说：亲爱的毛主席，亲爱的同志们！这时人们不断欢呼：
  “胡主席万岁！”然后他用越南话说：“首先让我代表越南民主共和国政府代表团向中国共产党、毛主席和参加游园大会的同志们、朋友们，致热烈的感谢！”
      “在中国解放以前，我来过中国，解放之后又来到了中国，前后的面貌大不相同。我亲眼看见中国人民在建设社会主义中的伟大成就。这种成就犹如越南人民的成就一样。越南人民和劳动党看到这种成就感到非常鼓舞。”
    胡志明主席讲话时，聚集在公园各处的群众所发出的欢呼声和会场内的欢呼声互相呼应，汇成一片欢腾。
    这时，中山公园已灯火通明。彭真宣布游园开始后，绿茵似锦的园地上，到处是欢愉的歌声，到处是生气勃勃的舞姿。

    毛主席和胡志明主席来到习礼亭前，在这里观看了越南和中国的青年文艺工作者的表演。越南人民歌舞团表演的节目是越南西北地区芒族和傣族的民间舞：“竹杆舞”。这是描写越南军民在战争胜利以后的联欢情景的舞蹈。表演者穿过互相拍击作声的竹杆间轻盈地舞蹈。毛泽东主席在表演结束后，特地向越南的舞蹈家招手致意。毛主席和胡志明主席接着观看了京剧舞蹈“拦马过关”。接着，毛主席和胡志明主席看了中国人民解放军海军政治部文工团表演的狮子舞和剑舞。
    毛主席和胡志明主席到那里，那里就掀起了高潮。人们知道，越南人民的胜利，以及越南人民为和平、统一的斗争，是对亚洲和世界和平的重要贡献。
    毛主席和胡志明主席和他们的亲密战友们在晚上十一时离开中山公园。这时，中山公园响彻了欢呼声和鼓掌声。
