Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th. Saigon Dispatch: On July 3rd, the people of Saigon held a demonstration demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities abide by the Geneva Accords and hold consultations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrange for free and fair general elections next year.

The demonstrators were suppressed by Ngo Dinh Diem's police, and more than 100 people were arrested.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th. Vietnam News Agency reported that recently, as the movement of the South Vietnamese people demanding the holding of political consultative conferences to prepare for next year's general election has been rising, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have strengthened their reign of terror in South Vietnam and intensified their persecution of former resistance personnel.

Tran Van Lam, the representative of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam, recently convened a meeting to discuss the implementation of a plan to persecute all those who advocate peace and reunification.

In the Central Vietnamese region, the persecution movement carried out by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities is also rampant. In the four provinces of Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh, Ngo Dinh Diem's secret agents colluded with the French Federal Forces to carry out large-scale attacks on former resistance personnel. They formed assassination squads composed of notorious hooligans and thugs, calling them "Mobile Security Police," in order to track, kidnap, and murder former resistance personnel who participated in the patriotic war.

Saigon newspapers reported that from the day of the ceasefire to May of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities had arrested 3,363 people in Quang Tri Province alone who had previously participated in or supported the resistance war. In Quang Nam Province, more than 200 murder and terrorist cases occurred, resulting in 520 casualties and 1,349 arrests. Currently, prisons in Da Nang, Hoi An, Tam Ky, and Tien Phu in Quang Nam Province are filled with detainees.

The Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army in the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee and the International Commission of Vietnam have continuously received many letters accusing these violations of the ceasefire agreement and requesting them to intervene.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 2nd. According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique recently launched a so-called "Oppose and Condemn Communists" movement, attempting to openly retaliate against those who had participated in or supported the resistance war, and persecute those who advocate peace and reunification. These actions have aroused strong anger among the people of Vietnam. Residents in the southern region of Vietnam, in their appeals to the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces to the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee, demanded that the other party immediately release all those arrested for participating in resistance activities and cease any retaliation against former resistance personnel.

Since the ceasefire, more than 3,000 incidents of retaliation against former resistance personnel have occurred in the southern region of Vietnam by the French side. The International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission of Vietnam has so far completed investigations into thirty-six cases of retaliation, and based on the findings, has concluded nine cases, determining that the French side violated the provisions of Article 14, Paragraph C of the Geneva Accords.

　　西贡人民示威要求就普选问题进行协商
    南越各地人民强烈抗议吴庭艳集团的报复行为
    新华社河内五日电　西贡消息：西贡人民在七月三日举行游行示威，要求南越当局遵照日内瓦协定同越南民主共和国举行协商以安排明年的自由普选。
    示威者遭到吴庭艳警察的镇压，一百多人被捕。
    新华社河内五日电　越南通讯社报道，最近，由于南越人民要求举行政治协商会议来准备明年的普选的运动日益高涨，吴庭艳当局在南越加强了恐怖统治，并加紧对前抗战人员进行迫害。
    吴庭艳当局驻南越的代表陈文林不久以前曾召开了一个会议，讨论实施迫害所有主张和平和统一的人的计划。
    在中越地区，吴庭艳当局进行的迫害运动也很猖獗。在富安、广南、广义、平定四省，吴庭艳的特务勾结法兰西联邦部队对前抗战人员进行大规模的袭击。他们把声名狼藉的流氓恶棍组成所谓“机动保安警察”的暗杀团，以便追踪、绑架和谋害参加爱国战争的前抗战人员。
    西贡报纸报道，从停火的那一天起到今年五月止，吴庭艳当局单在广治省就逮捕了三千三百六十三名以前参加或支持抗战的人员。在广南省发生了二百起以上的谋杀和恐怖案件，结果有五百二十个人伤亡，一千三百四十九人被捕。目前在广南省的岘港、会安、三岐和先福等地的监狱充满了被拘禁的人。
    越南中央联合停战委员会中的越南人民军代表团和越南国际委员会不断收到许多指责这种违反停战协定行为的信件，要求它们进行干涉。
    新华社河内二日讯　据越南通讯社报道：吴庭艳集团最近发动了一个所谓“反对和谴责共产党分子”的运动，企图公开地对那些曾经参加过或者支持过抗战的人们进行报复，并且迫害那些主张和平和统一的人们。这些行为已激起了越南全国人民的强烈的愤怒。越南南部地区的居民们在他们给法兰西联邦部队总司令部驻中央联合停战委员会代表团的申诉书中，要求对方立即释放所有因为参加过抗战活动而被逮捕的人们以及停止对前抗战人员的任何报复。
    从停战以来，法方在越南南部地区对前抗战人员进行报复的事件已发生了三千多起。越南国际监督和监察委员会到目前为止已经完成了对三十六起报复事件的调查，并且根据调查结果已对九起作出结论，断定法方违反了日内瓦协定第十四条丙款的规定。
