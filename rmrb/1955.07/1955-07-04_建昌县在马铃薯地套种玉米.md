Jianchang County Intercrops Corn in Potato Fields

During the summer hoeing period, Jianchang County, Hebei Province, summarized and promoted the experience of intercropping corn in potato fields to increase production. This year, the county planted more than 14,600 mu of potatoes, and plans to intercrop corn in more than 8,000 mu of potato fields. Farmers in Sanjia Village, District 1, planted 250 mu of potatoes this year and plan to intercrop 100 mu of corn. They have now intercropped more than 70 mu, and the early-planted corn seedlings have emerged from the soil, some already three or four inches tall.

Farmers in Jianchang County have the habit of growing potatoes, but after harvesting potatoes, they only grow autumn vegetables and rarely grow crops. In 1954, Zhang Fuling, a farmer in Yibaidongdi Village, intercropped corn in two mu of potato fields and produced 6,000 jin of potatoes and 840 jin of corn, equivalent to more than 2,500 jin of unprocessed grain, which was 1,800 jin more than growing sorghum. The intercropping method is: before the potatoes bloom, plant corn in the furrows. After the potatoes are harvested, the corn seedlings will also have grown. This can change one harvest per year into two harvests per year. (Sun Dongzhou)

　  建昌县在马铃薯地套种玉米
    热河省建昌县在夏锄期间，总结和推广了在马铃薯地套种玉米的增产经验。今年全县种了一万四千六百多亩马铃薯，计划在八千多亩马铃薯地套种玉米。一区三家村农民今年种了二百五十亩马铃薯，计划套种玉米一百亩，现已套种了七十多亩，早种的玉米苗已出土，有的已经三四寸高。
    建昌县农民都有种马铃薯习惯，但是收了马铃薯以后，只种秋菜，很少种植庄稼。一九五四年一百洞底村农民张富龄在二亩马铃薯地套种了玉米，共产了六千斤马铃薯，八百四十斤玉米，折原粮两千五百多斤，比种高粱多收了一千八百斤。套种的方法是：在马铃薯开花前，在垅沟里种上玉米，收了马铃薯后，玉米苗也长起来了。这样就可变一年收一季为一年收两季。　（孙东州）
