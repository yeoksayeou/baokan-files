How Shijiazhuang City is Carrying Out the Grain Conservation Campaign
    Qi Bin
    Since late March of this year, Shijiazhuang City has comprehensively launched a mass grain conservation campaign. Over the past few months, not only has the state saved a large amount of grain, but the ideological awareness of staff and citizens has also been raised through the grain conservation campaign, and the grain supply situation has also been stable. According to preliminary statistics, in April, May, and June, although Shijiazhuang City added some new grain consumption factors (the city's population increased by 13,000, and the use of grain for flood discharge canal construction and preferential grain purchase for cotton totaled 400,000 jin), the average monthly grain consumption was still 4.5 million jin less than the grain consumption in March.

    At the beginning of the movement, various ideological obstacles were encountered among different departments, some staff members, and the broad masses of workers and street residents. Some people in the grain processing and industrial grain consumption departments believed that ensuring quality and conservation were contradictory, saying "it is inevitable to waste something when doing something." Some staff members thought that "grain conservation is a trivial matter and should be left to the general affairs department to manage." Some workers and citizens said, "I have money to buy grain, and whether I waste it or not has nothing to do with others." In response to these ideological situations, the Municipal Party Committee held several meetings in succession to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization. Various units also launched extensive publicity and mobilization through report meetings, group meetings, forums, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and other means to correct thinking and establish a social atmosphere of "grain conservation is glorious, wasting grain is shameful, and illegal purchase and trafficking are illegal." The publicity also paid attention to combining specific examples, giving praise and encouragement to departments and individuals who had made achievements in grain conservation, and strictly criticizing the bad phenomena of wasting, over-purchasing, and hoarding grain, so that the broad masses of citizens began to realize the great significance of grain conservation, laying an ideological foundation for the grain conservation campaign.

    On this basis, a mass struggle to expose the waste of grain was launched through various forms. Various units checked the phenomena of grain waste in their own units. For example, in the grain processing department, the loss due to uncleared sacks and poorly handled native grain alone amounted to tens of thousands of jin per year. The flour mill's flour extraction rate was affected by uneven moisture content of wheat and inconsistent operating methods, resulting in a waste of more than one million jin of wheat per year. Among street residents, due to lax grain management, some people took the opportunity to over-purchase, falsely claim, hoard, and traffic grain, resulting in a large waste of state grain. Some government agencies, enterprises, and schools also violated the grain planned supply system, falsely reporting the number of people, over-reporting grain consumption, and failing to report grain storage, which were also very serious. For example, the transportation company's parking lot had more than 100 employees, but when reporting the grain consumption plan, it falsely reported 350 people; the actual monthly grain consumption was 4,000 jin, but it falsely reported that 14,000 jin were needed. The No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill had more than 40,000 jin of long-term grain storage in February and March alone. Some units had serious waste of grain due to poor food management. For example, some cooks in the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill dumped barrels of stewed pancakes, entire sieves of rice, and steamed cakes into the ditches without any regrets, and sometimes even used old steamed buns for firewood. Grain warehouses and transportation departments also had a lot of waste in grain transportation and storage. One warehouse spoiled more than 1,000 jin of corn and soaked more than 100 bags of rice at one time. After these phenomena were checked and exposed, many citizens and staff members deeply realized the urgency and necessity of grain conservation.

    After mobilizing the masses for serious criticism, many units formulated measures and established systems according to their own circumstances, effectively blocking the loopholes in grain waste. For example, flour mills universally promoted the advanced experience of "separate grinding and separate sieving," modified the flour routes, unified the operating methods, improved the wheat blending composition, and increased the flour extraction rate. The Local Industry Bureau also held an experience exchange training class for three flour mills. Some factories improved their machinery and equipment, reducing grain waste in all aspects. As a result of these measures, the three flour mills increased flour production by 576,000 jin more than the state plan in the second quarter, while the cost also decreased. For example, the power consumption of the No. 2 Flour Mill for grinding one bag of flour decreased from 1.1 degrees to 0.93 degrees. The grain conservation of various industrial grain consumption units also achieved significant results. For example, breweries used substitutes to make koji, textile mills reduced the sizing rate, and the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill reduced the sizing of each cloth from 0.197 kg to 0.162 kg. In the second quarter, various industrial grain consumption departments saved a total of 117,600 jin of grain.

    In terms of street residents, mobilizing the masses to formulate grain conservation covenants and specific conservation plans played a great role in saving grain. Some street residents proposed in the covenants to abide by the state's grain policy, respond to the call for grain conservation, not waste, not over-purchase, not hoard, and not traffic grain. At the same time, they also put forward grain conservation targets and specific methods, such as not dropping rice when cooking and not wasting leftovers. The Second District checked more than 9,000 households that signed covenants and saved more than 30,000 jin of grain. In addition, strengthening management, strictly reviewing the number of grain purchasers, days, and actual grain consumption by grain stores, and establishing a regular meeting system among residents' committees, police stations, and grain stores were very beneficial to leading, checking, and supervising residents' grain conservation. Some residents were also able to promptly report waste of grain and violations of the grain system to the police station and put forward suggestions to plug the loopholes in grain waste. In terms of government agencies, enterprises, and schools, food management was strengthened and improved. For example, the North China Workers' Middle School and the Fenghua Cigarette Factory promoted the "meal ordering pre-sale system" and the "table management system," strengthened the education of cooks, and improved the methods of making meals. According to statistics from 47 units, more than 30,000 jin of grain were saved in May alone compared to March. In terms of warehouse storage, the responsibility system for stacking and sweeping grain was established, and the working system of temperature measurement and testing of safe grain and dangerous grain was earnestly implemented, and the work of pest control and rat catching was strengthened. Therefore, the grain loss rate was greatly reduced, and the total grain loss was reduced by more than 61,000 jin in the second quarter.

    In order to make the grain conservation campaign continue to develop in depth, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, through the Grain Office in coordination with relevant departments, specially organized a grain conservation inspection team to conduct in-depth inspections, and convened a representative meeting on grain conservation, held a grain conservation exhibition, promoted advanced experience and methods of grain conservation, and gave criticism or punishment to some government agencies, enterprises, schools, and street residents who still had serious waste of grain. The representative meeting on grain conservation and the exhibition gave everyone another practical education, making the grain conservation campaign even more in-depth. It is preliminarily estimated that the city can save more than 25 million jin of grain from July 1955 to June 1956 (based on the actual grain consumption in March 1955).

    The main shortcomings in the current grain conservation work are that the development of the movement is uneven. It is better carried out in street residents, but poorer in government agencies and enterprises. The development is also uneven in the same system. Some units have unspecific grain conservation measures and generalized systems. In particular, a regular urban grain planned supply system has not yet been established, so the loopholes in grain waste cannot be completely blocked. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the city conducted another thorough inventory and registration work at the end of June, and more practically found out the standards for supplying grain, making consumption closer to reality, and laying a good foundation for further implementing the urban grain planned supply.

    石家庄市是怎样开展节约粮食运动的
    齐斌
    从今年三月下旬起，石家庄市就全面地展开了群众性的节约粮食运动。几个月来，不仅为国家节约了大量的粮食，工作人员和市民群众经过节约粮食运动思想觉悟也有所提高，粮食供应情况也很稳定。据初步统计，四、五、六月份，石家庄市虽然增加了一些新的用粮因素（市内人口增加了一万三千人，修泄洪渠和预购棉优待粮共用粮四十万斤），但每月平均用粮较三月份的用粮还少了四百五十多万斤。
    运动开始，在不同部门和部分工作人员以及广大职工、街道居民中，遇到了各式各样的思想阻力。粮食加工和工业用粮部门有些人认为保证质量和节约有矛盾，说“干什么难免糟蹋什么”。有些工作人员认为“节约粮食是事务事，交给总务部门去管就够了”。有些职工和市民说“我有钱我吃粮，浪费不浪费和别人没关系”。根据这些思想情况，市委曾连续数次召开会议，进行了深入的思想动员，各单位并通过报告会、片会、座谈会、读报组、黑板报等方式，展开了广泛的宣传动员，端正思想，树立“节约粮食光荣、浪费粮食可耻，套购、贩运违法”的社会风尚。宣传中并注意结合具体事例，对节约粮食有成绩的部门和个人给以表扬和鼓励，对浪费、多购、囤存粮食的坏现象进行了严格的批评，使广大市民群众开始认识到节约粮食的重大意义，为节约粮食运动奠定了思想基础。
    在这样的基础上，通过各种不同形式，展开了群众性的揭发浪费粮食的斗争，各单位纷纷检查了自己单位存在的浪费粮食现象。如在粮食加工部门，仅麻袋倒不净、土粮处理不好等每年损失即达数万斤。面粉厂由于麦子的干湿不匀，操作方法不一等原因，影响出粉率低，一年就浪费小麦一百多万斤。在街道居民中，由于粮食管理松懈，有些人就乘隙多购、冒领、囤存、贩运，造成了国家粮食大量浪费的现象。有些机关、企业、学校违反粮食计划供应制度，虚报人数，多报用粮，存粮不报等现象也很严重。如运输公司停车厂实有职工百多人，但造报用粮计划时，却虚报为三百五十人；每月实用粮四千斤，假报需用粮一万四千斤。国棉一厂仅二、三月份即长存粮达四万多斤。有些单位因为伙食管理不好，存在严重的浪费粮食的现象。如国棉二厂有些炊事员把成桶的烩饼、整筛的大米饭和蒸熟的糕，毫不可惜地倒在地沟里，有时甚至用旧馒头烧火。粮食仓库和运输部门，在粮食调运保管方面，也都有不少浪费。有一个仓库一次即霉坏玉米千多斤，淋湿大米百余包。这些现象经检查揭发后，使很多市民群众和工作人员都深刻认识到节约粮食的迫切和必要。
    经过发动群众严肃批判，不少单位都根据本单位情况，制定办法，建立制度，有效地堵塞了浪费粮食的漏洞。如面粉厂普遍推行了“分磨分筛”的先进经验，改装了粉路，统一了操作方法，改进了配麦成分，提高了出粉率。地方工业局还举办了三个面粉厂的经验交流训练班，有些厂改进了机器设备，从各方面减少了粮食的浪费。经过这些措施，三个面粉厂第二季度即较国家计划增产面粉五十七万六千斤，同时成本也有所降低。如面粉二厂每磨一袋面粉的耗电量由一点一度降至零点九三度。各工业用粮单位的粮食节约也有显著成绩。如酒厂用代用品制曲，纺织厂降低上浆率，国棉一厂每匹布上浆已由零点一九七公斤降为零点一六二公斤。第二季各工业用粮部门共计节约粮食十一万七千六百斤。
    在街道居民方面，发动群众制定节约粮食公约和具体节约计划，对节约用粮起作用很大。有些街道居民在公约中提出遵守国家粮食政策，响应节约粮食的号召，不浪费、不多购、不囤存、不贩运等，同时还提出了节约粮食的指标和具体办法，如作饭不丢米，不糟蹋剩饭等。二区检查了订公约的九千多户，就节约了粮食三万多斤。此外，加强管理，严格粮店对购粮人数、天数、实用粮数的审核工作，并建立了居民委员会、派出所、粮店相互间定期的碰头会议制度，对领导、检查、监督居民节约用粮很有好处。有些居民并能及时向派出所检举浪费粮食和违反粮食制度的行为，并提出堵塞浪费粮食漏洞的建议。在机关、企业、学校方面，加强和改进了伙食管理，如华北职工中学，风行烟厂等推行了“订饭预售制”“分桌管理制”，加强了对炊事员的教育，改进了饭菜的作法。据四十七个单位统计，五月份一个月即较三月份节约粮食三万多斤。仓库保管方面，建立了囤垛责任制、扫粮责任制，并认真执行了安全粮、危险粮测温化验工作制度，加强了防虫捕鼠工作，因此，使粮食耗损率大大降低，总计第二季度约减少粮食损耗六万一千多斤。
    为了使节约粮食运动持续深入地开展，中共石家庄市委通过粮食办公室协同有关部门，专门组织了节约粮食检查小组，深入检查，并召开了节约粮食的代表会议，举办了节约粮食展览会，推广节约粮食的先进经验和办法，对一些浪费粮食仍很严重的机关、企业、学校和街道居民分别给以批评或处分。经过节约粮食代表会和展览会使大家又受了一次实际的教育，使节约粮食运动又大大深入了一步。初步预计全市由一九五五年七月至一九五六年六月可节约粮食（以一九五五年三月份实用粮为基数）二千五百多万斤。
    当前节约粮食工作中的主要缺点是运动发展不平衡，街道居民中开展得较好，机关企业中开展得较差。在同一系统中也不平衡，有些单位节约措施不具体，制度一般化。特别是经常性的城市粮食计划供应制度尚未建立，因此，浪费粮食的漏洞仍不能彻底堵塞。为了克服这些缺点，全市在六月底又进行了一次彻底的清查登记工作，较切实地找出了供应粮食标准，使消费量更接近实际，为进一步实行城市粮食计划供应打好了基础。
