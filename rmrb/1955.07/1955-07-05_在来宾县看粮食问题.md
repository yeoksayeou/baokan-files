On the Grain Issue in Laibin County
National People's Congress Representative Mo Naiqun

I inspected work in Laibin and Liujiang counties in Guangxi, visiting Pingxi and Fenghuang townships in Laibin County, and Liwan and Chentuan townships in Liujiang County. Laibin is a county with a relatively poor natural environment and more severe disasters among the counties in Guangxi. Most of the area is loess hills, lacking water sources, prone to drought, with barren soil and low yields per unit area. Last year, due to drought, the late rice harvest in Pingxi Township was only about 60 jin per mu. In contrast to Laibin County, Liujiang is a relatively good county.

The grain issue here once experienced a state of tension. Why was there tension? Is there a problem with the policy of unified purchase and sale? Was the tension caused by the policy of unified purchase and sale? No, it wasn’t. Laibin is the most obvious example. The total amount of grain purchased in Laibin County was 18,402,300 jin, while more than 25,800,000 jin were sold from July 1954 to May of this year. It is clear that it was not a case of purchasing more and selling less, let alone purchasing without selling, but rather purchasing too little and selling too much.

Where does the reason for the tension lie? There are several main aspects:

First, natural disasters. Since August of last year, the province has lacked rain, causing winter and spring droughts last year; coupled with the frost disaster last winter, Laibin County lost more than 50 million jin (calculated in terms of rice), and Liujiang County lost more than 23 million jin. In this way, those in the masses who truly lacked grain naturally said they lacked grain; those who did not lack grain also said they lacked grain, because they were afraid of others asking them to borrow, afraid of having seeds but no harvest due to drought, and wanted to buy more grain to store for disaster relief. Some rural cadres also took the lead in purchasing more grain. This illustrates the reasons and nature of the grain tension. The tension was not caused by unified purchase and sale, but by natural disasters.

Second, the psychology of the peasant masses is to purchase more grain so they can eat more and keep more for themselves. So, as long as they can buy it, they buy as much as possible; if they can't buy it, they still clamor to buy it. This psychology of the peasant masses coincided with certain shortcomings in the work of some rural cadres, who responded to all requests without distinguishing between surplus and deficit, thus creating a great waste of grain. Because the grain supply was too loose at the beginning, a lot of grain was wasted, and the subsequent state of tension followed closely.

Third, there were shortcomings in the grain work. Because cadres lacked experience, and ideologically emphasized production and unified purchase while neglecting unified sale, they did not do enough to publicize the unified sale policy to the masses, and they did not clearly understand the surplus and deficit situation. They could not truly achieve supplying more to those with greater deficits, less to those with smaller deficits, and none to those without deficits. Instead, they did not distinguish between surplus and deficit and responded to all requests, supplying those who should not have been supplied and supplying more than should have been supplied. It was not until later, when they realized the grain situation was tense, that they understood the problem was not simple. As a result, some districts and townships adopted egalitarian methods, rigidly adhering to quotas, without distinguishing between surplus and deficit, resulting in a very wide range of supply with very small amounts, causing ideological confusion and unease among the masses. After taking a big detour in their work, they seriously rectified the unified sale work. Generally speaking, after rectifying the unified sale work and carrying out disaster relief work, the tense situation has been eased. At the same time, because early corn, melons, and vegetables have been harvested, the problem has been basically solved.

Fourth, class enemies and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to sabotage. These people are always and everywhere trying to undermine our socialist cause. Coupled with the shortcomings in our cadres' work and some weaknesses in the thinking of the masses, this gave them an opportunity to take advantage of, spread rumors, sow discord, and incite discontent, so that some deceived masses echoed and blindly shouted. There were also speculators and illegal merchants who took the opportunity to make trouble, purchase grain in sets, engage in black market trading, and disrupt the state grain market. In addition to staple grains, they also purchased coarse grains in sets, causing coarse grain prices to be higher than staple grain prices.

Based on the situation I saw and heard during the inspection, I have gained several insights:

First, it is necessary to comprehensively and correctly implement the policy of unified purchase and sale and complete the "three fixings" work, without emphasizing one over the other and neglecting unified sale. Cadres must strive to study policies and improve their policy level, so that when implementing policies, they will be comprehensive rather than one-sided, and correct rather than deviating, so that they can do a good job in both unified purchase and unified sale.

Second, it is necessary to strengthen the propaganda and education of policies among the masses, raise the political consciousness of the masses, and dispel ideological concerns. The masses are sure to support the policy. Facts have also proven that after rectifying the unified sale work, the scope and amount of unified sales have generally been reduced, and the masses not only do not demand to purchase more grain, but also return the excess grain they purchased.

Third, it is necessary to consolidate the existing agricultural cooperatives and continue to expand the socialist position in the countryside. Agricultural cooperatives have not only demonstrated their superiority in doing a good job in production, but also demonstrated their superiority in unified purchase and sale. An agricultural cooperative in Fenghuang Township, Laibin, sold more surplus grain to the state than ordinary farmers, and there were no grain-deficient households, so there was no need for the state to supply grain. Therefore, we should consolidate existing agricultural cooperatives, continue to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and increase grain production to meet the needs of consumption growth.

### 在来宾县看粮食问题

　　在来宾县看粮食问题
　　全国人民代表大会代表　莫迺群
    我在广西的来宾和柳江两县视察工作，到过来宾县的平西乡和凤凰乡，柳江县的里弯乡和陈团乡。来宾在广西各县中是自然环境较差、灾情较重的一个县。全境绝大部分是黄土丘陵，缺少水源，最易受旱，土壤贫瘠，单位面积产量低；去年因旱减产，平西乡晚稻一亩只收六十斤左右。和来宾县相反，柳江则是比较好的一个县。
    这里的粮食问题，曾经一度出现紧张状态。为什么会紧张？是否统购统销政策有问题呢？是否因为统购统销政策造成了紧张状态呢？不是的。来宾是最明显的一个例证。来宾全县统购数是一千八百四十万二千三百斤，一九五四年七月至今年五月销出了二千五百八十万多斤。可见不是多购少销，更不是购而不销，乃是购的少、销的多。
    紧张原因在那里？主要有几个方面：
    第一、自然灾害。从去年八月以来，全省缺雨，造成去年冬旱和今年春旱；加以去冬又有冻灾，来宾全县减收了五千万斤以上（折合大米计算），柳江全县减收了二千三百万斤以上。这样，群众中真缺粮的固然说缺粮；不缺粮的也说缺粮，这是因为怕别人向他求借，怕天旱有种无收，想多买些粮食储存备荒。也有个别乡村干部带头多购粮食。这里说明了粮食紧张的原因和性质。紧张不是统购统销造成的，而是自然灾害造成的。
    第二、农民群众的心理是多购一些粮食，自己可以多吃点，多留点，所以只要能够买得到，就尽可能的买；买不到也叫喊要买。农民群众这种心理，刚巧碰上了某些乡村干部工作中的缺点，不分余缺，有求必应，这样又造成了粮食很大的浪费。由于粮食供应前面太松了，浪费掉很多粮食，于是后面的紧张状态，就接踵而至。
    第三、粮食工作有缺点。由于干部缺乏经验，在思想上又是重视生产，重视统购，忽视统销，对群众宣传统销政策做得不够，对余缺情况也没有摸清，不能真正做到多缺多供，少缺少供，不缺不供，而是余缺不分，有求必应，不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了；直到后来，发现粮食情况紧张，这才知道问题不简单。于是有的区乡采取平均主义的办法，死扣指标，余缺不加区别，弄的供应的面很宽，供应的量很小，引起群众思想混乱，情绪不安。在工作上走了很大的弯路以后，才认真整顿统销工作。一般地说：经过整顿统销工作又进行了救灾工作，紧张情况已经是缓和下来。同时，由于早玉米、瓜菜之类又已收获，问题基本上是解决了。
    第四、阶级敌人和反革命分子乘机破坏。本来这些人是随时随地都在企图破坏我们的社会主义事业的。加以我们干部工作上有缺点，群众思想上又有些弱点，这样就给了他们以可乘之机，造谣惑众，挑拨离间，鼓动不满情绪，以致有些被欺骗的群众，随声附和，盲目叫喊。还有投机分子、不法商贩，也乘机捣乱，套购粮食，搞黑市买卖，破坏国家粮食市场。他们除主粮以外，还套购杂粮，造成杂粮价格比主粮还高的现象。
    根据视察所见所闻的情况，使我得到几点体会：
    第一、必须全面地正确地贯彻统购统销政策，完成“三定”工作，不能重彼轻此，忽视统销。干部要努力学习政策，提高政策水平，这样，在执行政策的时候，才会是全面而不致片面，才会是正确而不出偏差，既能搞好统购，又能搞好统销。
    第二、必须在群众中加强政策的宣传教育，提高群众的政治觉悟，解除思想顾虑，群众是一定拥护政策的。事实也已证明：整顿统销工作以后，统销的面和量一般都压缩了下来，群众不仅不要求多购粮食，还把多购的退了出来。
    第三、必须巩固现有的农业合作社，继续扩大社会主义在农村的阵地。农业合作社不仅在搞好生产方面表现了它的优越性；同样，在统购统销方面也表现了它的优越性。来宾凤凰乡的一个农业合作社，卖给国家的余粮，比一般农户多，也没有缺粮户，用不着国家供应粮食。所以应该巩固现有农业合作社，继续发展互助合作运动，增加粮食生产，适应消费增长的需要。
