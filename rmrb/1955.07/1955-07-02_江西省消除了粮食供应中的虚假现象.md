　　Jiangxi Province Eliminates False Phenomena in Grain Supply
　　Jiang Yi
    Like several other provinces and regions, Jiangxi Province also experienced a period of "tension" in grain supply this spring. As a result, some people complained, "The supply is too small." In fact, the "tension" was mostly a false phenomenon; this year's grain supply was even greater than last year. So, what was the real reason? The main reason was shortcomings in our work. Many staff members at that time emphasized unified purchase but neglected unified sales, relaxing the unified sales work. When issuing supply certificates, they did not investigate or study, and gave them to whoever made the most noise. Some grassroots staff members also echoed the sentiment of "grain shortage" and issued blank slips indiscriminately. The clerk of the eighth district of Chongyi County kept blank slips and stamps in his pocket, issuing them to whoever wanted them. As a result, those who should not have been supplied were supplied, those who should have been supplied less were supplied more, and a small number of those who should have been supplied were not supplied in time. In five townships of the third district of Xinyu County, out of a total of 2,712 households, only 240 households were short of grain, with a total shortage of 91,127 jin. However, these five townships reported to the district that they needed to supply 1,056 households, claiming a shortage of 401,092 jin, more than three times the actual shortage. This serious situation reached its peak in March. Seventy counties across the province exceeded their sales targets by more than 70 percent; of these, 25 exceeded 80 percent, nine exceeded 90 percent, and two exceeded 100 percent. The province's average daily sales exceeded the target by more than 39 percent. The province's total sales in March increased by 37.6 percent compared to January, 58.19 percent compared to February, and 28.49 percent compared to the same period last year. If the province's daily sales in the second quarter continued to accumulate according to the above figures, it would exceed the planned supply figure by more than 240 million jin, a rather serious situation.
    Was the state of grain unified sales due to a reduction in supply targets, meaning that the province genuinely did not have enough grain to eat? In fact, this was not the case at all. According to statistics: Last year, the province's total grain output was 11.489 billion jin, generally maintaining the 1953 grain output level. After deducting the grain requisitioned, the province's rural areas retained a total of approximately 10.01 billion jin of grain (including approximately 7.193 billion jin of surplus grain after requisition and 2.82 billion jin supplied by the state), averaging 583 jin of grain per person. Compared with the same period from 1953 to 1954, except for the Gannan Administrative Region which was roughly the same, and the Shangrao and Ji'an special districts which decreased slightly, the remaining Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Fuzhou special districts retained 0.79 to 4.63 percent more grain; plus the various grains harvested in various places, it should be said that it was sufficient to guarantee the reasonable needs of the people of the province. This was the case for the province as a whole, as well as for individual special districts and counties. Last year, the total grain output of Jinxi County was more than 112.696 million jin of rice. After the state requisitioned more than 18.724 million jin of rice and purchased more than 43.241 million jin of rice, the rural areas still retained more than 50.73 million jin of rice; plus the 9.68 million jin of rice supplied by the state (equivalent to 13.828571 million jin of rice), totaling more than 64.558 million jin of rice. According to the county's population, the average person had 662 jin of rice. This figure was 79 jin of rice more than the province's average per capita grain; if hoarding and waste could be avoided, it would be sufficient no matter what. However, since the beginning of spring, the grain supply in this county, like other places, experienced a "tense" situation. The actual sales volume of rice in the first quarter exceeded the planned figure by 22.18 percent, and the supply volume in April was 512,223 jin more than the supply volume in the same period last year. The average daily sales volume for the entire month reached 45,763 jin, and the highest daily sales volume reached 69,040 jin. By the end of April, the amount of grain supplied in the county had reached 86.84 percent of the total annual target, leaving only a remaining target of 1,366,277 jin. If calculated based on the aforementioned average daily sales volume, a total of 2,791,543 jin of rice would be needed by the end of June, which would exceed the target by 1,425,266 jin of rice. After rectifying the grain unified sales work, the county verified the supply, reduced the unreasonable supply portion, and voluntarily returned the over-received portion, totaling 1,784,311 jin of rice. After supplementing the grain shortage and increasing the supply for farmers with insufficient supply by 77,426 jin of rice, the state recovered 1,706,885 jin of rice that should not have been supplied. The county's supply by the end of June not only did not exceed the plan, but also had a surplus of 281,619 jin of rice, replenishing the reserve stock; at the same time, the masses were satisfied. These facts tell us that the "tension" in rural grain supply is a false phenomenon; as long as the work is done well, it can be stabilized and normalized.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee grasped this actual situation and carried out the work of rectifying grain unified sales in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
    In order to achieve reasonable supply, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee successively dispatched a large number of staff members to the countryside in April and May to assist various localities in carrying out the rectification of grain unified sales work in conjunction with the development of the production movement. Various localities extensively and deeply carried out political and ideological education work, so that staff members, Party members, League members, and activists could correctly recognize where the problem of grain supply lay, recognizing that it was not due to insufficient grain supply, but mainly due to unreasonable supply. The sentiment of staff members blindly demanding an increase in supply targets was analyzed and criticized. After the staff members' thinking was straightened out, they explained the principle of reasonable supply of "supplying more to those with larger shortages, less to those with smaller shortages, and not supplying to those with no shortages" to the masses, breaking down the various ideological concerns of the peasant masses. Then, based on the 1954 unified purchase and sales records and in combination with this year's in-depth understanding, the masses were mobilized to calculate the big picture and the detailed picture, relying on the masses to clarify the boundaries of surplus, shortage, and sufficiency, and re-examine the supply certificates; and through mass discussion, it was ensured that those who should not be supplied were not supplied, and those who should be supplied less were not supplied more, guaranteeing the necessary supply for households with grain shortages.
    In the rectification of grain unified sales work, the Party's class line in the countryside was implemented. For the middle peasants and new middle peasants with surplus grain, the method of persuasion and education was used to dispel their concerns, and they voluntarily conducted transactions in the national grain market. For a small number of landlords, rich peasants, and hidden counter-revolutionaries who deliberately spread rumors and sabotage, they were given severe blows. In the rectification of grain unified sales work in Nanchang County, the fact that rich peasant Chen Honggui and others hid more than 5,000 jin of grain in thirteen places such as cowsheds and earthen cellars, while making unreasonable demands for supply, was exposed in a timely manner, raising the awareness of staff members and the masses. As a result, the daily sales volume in mid-May decreased by 33.5 percent compared to the first ten days of the month.
    During this period, Jiangxi Province also widely carried out a grain saving movement. In most cities and towns with more than 2,000 people across the province, the population and grain consumption plans were further verified, initially eliminating the past phenomena of loose urban supply and serious grain waste, and cracking down on the grain speculation activities of unscrupulous merchants. In addition to saving grain, farmers in various places also planted early-maturing crops, striving to buy less grain from the state. Grain management departments also strengthened supply management work, changed supply methods, and began to promote saving and preventing grain waste from the organizational and institutional perspectives.
    The rectification of grain unified sales work in most areas of Jiangxi Province ended at the end of May. The false "tension" in grain has gradually disappeared, the phenomenon of over-sales has been basically eliminated, and the average daily sales volume has now fallen below the national target; the mood of the masses is stable, and the enthusiasm for production has been improved. Early rice in Nanchang, Shangrao, Fuzhou, Ji'an and other special districts has been universally weeded twice, and many areas have carried out the third weeding. In the past, some places were accustomed to planting "white water fields"; after rectifying grain unified sales, farmers launched a fertilizer accumulation movement during the weeding gaps in order to increase grain production.
    At present, rural areas in various parts of Jiangxi are still, in accordance with the instructions recently issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, further eliminating the phenomenon of tight or loose grain supply in some areas in conjunction with production, and further implementing the reasonable supply policy to consolidate the achievements of the rectification of grain unified sales work.

　　江西省消除了粮食供应中的虚假现象
　　江贻
    像其他若干省区一样，江西省在今年春季也曾一度出现粮食供应的“紧张”现象。因此，有些人埋怨说：“供应量太少了。”其实，“紧张”现象多是虚假的现象；今年供应的粮食比去年还多。那末，原因究竟在哪里呢？主要是因为工作中发生了缺点。许多工作人员那时有重视统购，轻视统销的思想，放松了统销工作。他们在发供应证时，不调查，不研究，看谁闹得凶就给谁。有些基层工作人员也跟着说“缺粮”，乱开白条子。崇义县第八区文书把白条子和章子放在口袋里，谁要就给谁开。这样做的结果，自然是不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了，也有一小部分应该供应的反而没有及时供应。新喻县第三区五个乡，共计二千七百一十二户，其中只有二百四十户缺粮，共缺九万一千一百二十七斤。但这五个乡向区里报告要供应的竟达一千零五十六户，说缺粮四十万一千零九十二斤，较实际缺粮数扩大三倍以上。这种严重情况，到三月份可以说达到了顶点。全省各县销售数超出指标百分之七十以上的有七十个县；其中超出百分之八十以上的有二十五个县，超出百分之九十以上的有九个县，超出百分之百以上的有两个县。全省平均日销量超过指标百分之三十九强。全省三月份全月销量较一月份增加百分之三十七点六，较二月份增加百分之五十八点一九，较去年同一期间增加百分之二十八点四九。如果全省第二季度日销量继续按上述数字累加上去，就要突破计划供应数字二亿四千多万斤，情况是相当严重的。
    粮食统销处于这种状态，是不是因为供应指标少了，全省的粮食真的不够吃了呢？事实上完全不是这样的。根据统计：去年全省粮食产量为一百一十四亿八千九百万斤，一般保持了一九五三年粮食产量水平。除征购粮食外，全省农村共留粮一百亿零一千万斤左右（其中征购后余粮约七十一亿九千三百万斤，国家供应二十八亿二千万斤），平均每人有粮五百八十三斤。如果同一九五三年到一九五四年同一时期比较，除赣南行政区大致相同，上饶、吉安两专区略有减少以外，其余南昌、九江、抚州三专区都多留了粮食百分之零点七九到百分之四点六三；再加上各地收获的杂粮，应该说是足可保证全省人民的合理需要的。就全省来说是如此，就一个专区、一个县的情况来看也是如此。金谿县去年粮食总产量为稻谷一亿一千二百六十九万六千多斤，除去国家征了稻谷一千八百七十二万四千多斤，购了稻谷四千三百二十四万一千多斤以外，农村留粮尚有稻谷五千零七十三万多斤；加上国家供应大米九百六十八万斤（折合稻谷一千三百八十二万八千五百七十一斤），共计稻谷六千四百五十五万八千多斤；按照该县人口计算，平均每人有稻谷六百六十二斤。这个数字比全省每人粮食平均数还多七十九斤稻谷；如能做到不囤积、不浪费，无论如何也是够用的。可是，自入春以来，这个县的粮食供应和其他地方一样地出现了“紧张”情况，第一季度大米实际销售量超过计划数字百分之二十二点一八，四月份供应量又比去年同期供应量多五十一万二千二百二十三斤，全月平均日销量达四万五千七百六十三斤，最高日销量达六万九千零四十斤。至四月底止，全县供应粮食量已达到跨年度总指标的百分之八十六点八四，仅剩余指标一百三十六万六千二百七十七斤。如以上述平均日销量推算，到六月底止，共需大米二百七十九万一千五百四十三斤，也就是要突破指标计大米一百四十二万五千二百六十六斤。整顿粮食统销工作以后，全县核实供应，减少了不合理供应部分和自愿退回多领部分，共计大米一百七十八万四千三百一十一斤，除补给缺粮和缺多供少的农户增补大米七万七千四百二十六斤以外，国家收回了不应该供应的粮食计大米一百七十万六千八百八十五斤。全县到六月底的供应不仅不会突破计划，而且还多余大米二十八万一千六百一十九斤，充实了库存后备；同时，群众也满意了。这些事实告诉了我们：农村粮食供应的“紧张”是一种虚假现象；只要做好工作，是可以使它趋于稳定和正常的。
    中共江西省委、省人民委员会掌握了这种实际情况，根据中共中央和国务院指示的精神进行了整顿粮食统销工作。
    为了做到供应合理，中共江西省委、省人民委员会先后于四、五月间两次抽调大批工作人员下乡，协助各地在开展生产运动中结合进行整顿粮食统销工作。各地广泛、深入地进行了政治思想教育工作，使工作人员、党员、团员和积极分子正确认识粮食供应的问题在哪里，认识这并不是粮食供应量不够，而主要是供应不合理。对于工作人员盲目要求增加供应指标的情绪进行了分析和批判。工作人员思想打通以后，便向群众讲解“缺多多供，缺少少供，不缺不供”的合理供应原则，打破农民群众的各种思想顾虑。然后，以去年统购统销的底册为基础，结合今年的深入了解，发动群众算大账，算细账，依靠群众摸清余、缺、够的界限，重新审查供应证；并且通过群众讨论，切实做到不该供应的不供应，该少供应的不多供应，保证缺粮户必需的供应。
    在整顿粮食统销工作中，贯彻了党在农村中的阶级路线。对于有余粮的中农和新中农，运用说服教育的方法使他们打消顾虑，在国家粮食市场上自愿地进行交易。对于少数蓄意造谣破坏的地主、富农和潜伏的反革命分子，则给予严厉的打击。南昌县在整顿粮食统销工作中，及时地揭露了富农陈洪贵等一方面把五千多斤粮食藏在牛栏、土窖等十三个地方，一方面胡乱要求供应的事实，提高了工作人员和群众的觉悟。结果，五月中旬日销量比上旬下降了百分之三十三点五。
    江西省在这期间还广泛地开展了节约粮食运动。全省二千人以上的城镇，绝大部分都进一步核实了人口和用粮计划，初步消除了过去城市供应偏松和严重浪费粮食的现象，并打击了奸商的粮食投机行为。各地农民除节约粮食之外，还栽种早熟作物，争取少向国家买粮食。粮食管理部门也加强了供应管理工作，改变供应办法，开始做到从组织上、制度上促进节约和防止浪费粮食。
    江西省大部分地区的整顿粮食统销工作已在五月底结束。粮食的虚假的“紧张”情况已经逐渐消失，超销现象基本上已经消除，现在平均日销量已下降到国家指标以下；群众情绪安定，生产积极性提高了。南昌、上饶、抚州、吉安等专区早稻已普遍耘了二次禾，不少地区进行了第三次耘禾。过去有些地方种惯了“白水田”；经过整顿粮食统销后，农民们为了增产粮食，都利用耘禾间隙展开积肥运动。
    目前，江西各地农村还在根据中共江西省委最近发出的指示，结合生产进一步消除部分地区粮食供应偏紧或偏松的现象，进一步贯彻合理供应政策，以巩固整顿粮食统销工作的成果。
