The Potential of an Old Paper Machine is Tapped
By Our Reporter Ji Yin

    In the old workshops of the Shanghai State-owned Lihua Paper Mill, a large paper machine is installed. This machine has spent over fifty years here. Now, no worker in the entire factory came to the factory with it, and no one can tell its detailed history. People only know that it experienced the Xinhai Revolution, warlord battles, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and even suffered directly from two major fires. At that time, the factory buildings were completely destroyed, and the machine was also damaged.

    After liberation, this old paper machine continued to be used, and the rumbling sound of the machine vibrated the old workshop day and night. However, the staff of the Lihua Paper Mill were not very interested in this machine, because although the production quantity of this old machine increased after liberation, the quality of the products had always been very poor. There were dozens of kinds of defects on the paper, such as unqualified physical tensile strength and density, wet spots, folds, pulp lumps, cloud flowers, etc. It can be said that all the quality defects found on general paper were all present on Paper Machine No. 1. Especially since the third quarter of 1953, after the state issued quality standards for paper, stipulating that unqualified paper would not be included in the task quota, Paper Machine No. 1 produced a lot, but upon inspection, it was almost always entirely unqualified. The production plan completion indicator board in the workshop constantly had "zeroes" marked on it. The technical staff were exhausted, and the workers were all dejected. Sometimes, the machine's production suddenly improved, and the qualified rate even reached 60 percent. The workers were happy for a while, but the next day, "zeroes" appeared on the indicator board again, and the workers' joy disappeared.

    The poor product quality of Paper Machine No. 1 caused difficulties in completing the factory's production tasks. Because it was the machine with the largest output in the factory, its products accounted for more than 40 percent of the total value of the factory's production. The quality of its production had a significant impact on the completion of the factory's production tasks. Since Paper Machine No. 1 failed to complete its production tasks, the Lihua Paper Mill failed to complete its tasks month after month. The newspaper constantly criticized the factory, and the leadership constantly urged the factory to make rapid improvements.

    How to change the production situation of Paper Machine No. 1? Two different opinions emerged. Many people were disappointed with this machine that had been working for more than fifty years. They said: The machine is too old and useless. To produce good quality products, the equipment must be completely refitted and the machine renovated. Otherwise, there is no way. They pinned all their hopes on large-scale capital construction. Under the guidance of this view, in the second quarter of last year, the factory decided to start refitting Paper Machine No. 1, compiling a huge capital construction plan. The plan stipulated that the entire massive machine would be turned around, the copper wire mesh on the machine would be lengthened, equipment would be added, the drying cylinders would be raised, the entire foundation would be renovated, and the factory building would be heightened. In short, everything would be rebuilt according to the style of advanced factories. This project would not only require an investment of more than 500,000 yuan, but also require the workshop to stop production for half a year. Some people applauded this plan, believing that this was the real way to make the old Paper Machine No. 1 reborn.

    Some people had another view. They believed that although this machine had been working for more than fifty years, it was still strong and not old. The quality problems were not due to the machine itself, but because people had not yet grasped its rules. Although the machine had some shortcomings, the main problem was our work had shortcomings. Improving quality must start with improving work. However, this opinion did not initially attract attention. The former view was clearly dominant in the factory.

    It was not until the beginning of last year that the entire factory, from leaders to employees, studied the general task of the state's transition period. During the study, everyone couldn't help but discuss Paper Machine No. 1: Should improving product quality start with large-scale addition of equipment and reconstruction, or with improving technical management? They raised a fact: the quality of Paper Machine No. 1's products was not bad every day. Sometimes it suddenly improved. For example, one day the qualification rate reached 60 percent, but the next day it dropped to 10 percent. If the machine itself was not working, how should the sudden improvement in product quality be explained? It was clear that the problem was that people had not grasped the rules of work, and therefore could not consolidate this accidental achievement. Through study and discussion, more and more people began to realize that simply relying on capital construction to improve the production of old enterprises was obviously wrong and contrary to the state's requirements for old enterprises during the transition period. Therefore, they should seek another way to improve the condition of Paper Machine No. 1.

    At this time, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry convened a factory director meeting, pointing out that factories must strengthen technical management and formulate process regulations to improve product quality. Therefore, in the second quarter, the Lihua Paper Mill launched the work of strengthening technical management, transferring a large number of technicians to the workshop to measure the machine and summarize the workers' operations. Through measurement and summarization, many specific facts showed that the past poor product quality was not due to the machine being old, but because technical management was too chaotic and workers operated based on personal experience without scientific and unified operating procedures. For example, in the past, the machine was always blamed for having problems, but measurements proved that the wet spots on the paper were actually due to the pulp concentration being too high and poor operation. As long as the concentration was adjusted and the operation improved, the problem could be solved. Sometimes the quality of the paper suddenly improved, which was the result of correct operation, but because there was no record, the achievements could not be consciously consolidated. After this summary, many mysteries about quality problems were solved. The factory absorbed the reasonable parts of the workers' operations, discarded the incorrect parts, and formulated process regulations. They established a technical management organization, a process regulation inspection responsibility system to promptly check and correct errors in the implementation of the regulations, and a production technology post responsibility system to ensure that the leadership of various production technologies and the implementation of process regulations could be responsible at each level.

    While formulating process regulations, the factory also took some technical measures based on the problems found in the inspection of Paper Machine No. 1, repairing the first water-pressing roller, refitting the second water-pressing roller, and then adding a smoothing roller. These technical measures took little time and cost little money, but they were all key issues for Paper Machine No. 1.

    After these two aspects of efforts, the production situation of Paper Machine No. 1 suddenly changed. The product qualification rate increased significantly, and by December of last year, it began to meet and exceed national standards. Starting in January of this year, problems such as wet spots and folds, which had been persistent for several years, were eliminated. The production indicator board no longer showed the heartbreaking "zeroes," but exceeded the plan every month. This old machine has vigorously caught up with the other paper machines. In May of this year, Paper Machine No. 1 completed the state plan for May six days ahead of schedule, enabling the Lihua Paper Mill, which had not completed the state plan for fifteen months, to fully complete the state plan for the first time this month. The entire factory was filled with joy. In June of this year, the entire factory exceeded the state plan by 4 percent, and Paper Machine No. 1 exceeded it by more than 15 percent.

    The views of the employees of the Lihua Paper Mill on Paper Machine No. 1 have completely changed. Everyone in the factory praised Paper Machine No. 1, and the workers in the paper-making workshop were even more excited. Recently, when I visited the Lihua Paper Mill, the old worker Xi Shunfu led me to visit the factory building of Paper Machine No. 1. "Look how energetic it is in production, it's really not much worse than a new machine!" he said to me, pointing to the booming Paper Machine No. 1 in front of him. At this time, milky white pulp was evenly flowing through the copper wire mesh of Paper Machine No. 1 and into the machine. And at the other end of the machine, white and smooth coated printing paper was flowing out continuously like water. Xi Shunfu readily took a few sheets of paper, shook them a few times, and exclaimed, "What good paper this is! Look, it's snow-white, smooth, without any blemishes. It's great for printing pictorials!"

    The employees of the Lihua Paper Mill have now completely abandoned the large-scale reconstruction plan for Paper Machine No. 1. They feel that canceling this wasteful plan and choosing the path of tapping the potential of the machine is a victory for the Party's policy and a victory for all the employees of the factory.

    一部老造纸机的潜力被挖掘出来了
    本报记者　季音
    在上海国营利华造纸厂古旧的厂房里，安装了一部庞大的造纸机。这部机器已经在这里度过五十多年了，现在全厂已找不出一个工人是同它一起来到工厂的，也已经没有人能说出它的详细历史。人们只知道它曾经经历过辛亥革命，军阀混战和抗日战争，并且还曾经直接遭到了两次大火灾。当时厂房完全烧毁了，机器也受了损伤。
    解放以后，这部老造纸机继续被使用着，隆隆的机器轰鸣声，昼夜不息地震动这个古旧的厂房。但是利华造纸厂的工作人员们，对这部机器却很不感兴趣，因为这部老机器在解放后生产数量虽然增加了，但是产品的质量一直很不好，纸张上的毛病达数十种之多，什么物理性的拉力、紧度不合格啦，湿斑啦，折子啦，浆块啦，云彩花啦等等，可以说凡是一般纸张上所有的质量毛病，在一号造纸机上真是样样齐全了。特别是从一九五三年第三季度起，国家颁发了纸张的质量标准，规定不合格的纸张一律不能计算在任务以内后，一号造纸机产品虽然生产了很多，但一检查，几乎经常是全部不合格，车间每日生产计划完成情况指示牌上就不断画上了“零”。技术人员被弄得焦头烂额，工人们也个个垂头丧气。有时候，机器生产情况突然好了，合格品甚至达到了百分之六十，工人们一阵欢喜，但是紧接着第二天指示牌上又出现了“零”，工人们的欢喜也就随之消失。
    一号造纸机产品质量低劣，给全厂生产任务的完成造成了困难。因为它是厂里产量最大的一部机器，它的产品占全厂生产总值的百分之四十以上。它的生产情况的好坏对全厂生产任务的完成起举足轻重的影响。自从一号机完不成生产任务以来，利华造纸厂也就月月完不成任务，报纸上不断地给予批评，领导上也不断督促，要求工厂迅速改进。
    怎样改变一号造纸机的生产状况呢？在这里，发生了两种分歧意见。有许多人对这部已工作了五十多年的机器失望了，他们说：机器年纪太大啦，不中用啦，要想出质量好的产品，只有彻底地改装设备，翻新机器，否则没有办法。他们把全部的希望寄托在大规模的基本建设上，就在这种说法的指导下，去年第二季度，厂里决心动手改装第一号机，编造了一个庞大的基本建设计划，计划中规定要把这部庞大机器整个掉一个头，把机器上的铜网放长，增加设备，抬高烘缸，整个地基要翻修，厂房要盖高。总之，一切都按照先进厂的样式来重新改建。这项工程不仅要投资五十万元以上，而且车间要停止生产半年。有些人对这个计划，连连拍手叫好，认为这才是使年老的一号造纸机新生的真正道路。
    有些人却有另一种看法，他们认为：这部机器虽已工作了五十多年，但还很强壮，并没有衰老。质量问题的发生不是由于机器不好，而在于人们还没有摸到它的规律。机器虽然有些缺点，但主要是我们工作有缺点。改进质量就得先从改进工作着手。但是，这个意见最初并没有引起重视，前一种说法在厂里显然地占了优势。
    一直到去年年初，全厂从领导到职工进行了国家过渡时期总任务的学习，在学习中大家不禁联系到一号机讨论起来：到底改善产品质量应当从大规模地增添设备和改建着手？还是从改进技术管理工作着手？他们提出了一个事实：一号机产品的质量不是每天都很坏的，有时候也突然好起来，譬如有一天的合格率曾达到百分之六十，但第二天又下降到百分之十；如果是机器本身不行，那末产品质量突然好转的现象应怎样来解释呢？可见问题是在于人们没有摸到工作的规律，因而不能巩固这个偶然的成就。通过学习和讨论，愈来愈多的人开始认识到单纯地依靠基本建设来改善旧有企业生产的做法，显然是错误的，是同国家过渡时期对旧有企业的要求相违背的，因此，他们应当寻求另外的一条道路，来改善一号机的状况。
    就在这时候，轻工业部造纸工业管理局召开了厂长会议，指出各厂提高产品质量必须从加强技术管理，制定工艺规程入手。于是就在第二季度，利华造纸厂开展了加强技术管理的工作，抽调大批技术人员下车间对机器进行测定，将工人的操作进行总结。通过了测定和总结，许多具体事实说明了过去产品质量不好并非是机器老旧，而是由于技术管理太混乱，工人们凭个人的经验操作，而没有科学的统一的操作制度。譬如过去总是怪机器有毛病，而测定后证明纸上有湿斑实际上是纸浆浓度太大和操作不良的缘故，只要调节浓度，改进操作就行。有时候纸的质量突然提高了，这是由于正确操作的结果，但因为没有记录，成绩也就不能自觉巩固。经过这次总结，许多关于质量问题的闷葫芦打开了，厂里吸收了工人操作中的合理部分，抛弃了不正确部分，制定了工艺规程。他们建立了技术管理的机构，建立了工艺规程检查责任制，及时检查和纠正执行规程中的错误，又建立了生产技术岗位责任制，使各项生产技术的领导工作人员对生产技术和工艺规程的执行能按级负责。
    在制定工艺规程的同时，厂里还根据在检查一号造纸机中发现的问题，采取了一些技术措施，修理了第一道压水辊，改装了第二道压水辊，以后又加装了一道光滑辊。这些技术措施费时短、花钱少，但却都是一号机的关键问题。
    经过这两方面的努力以后，一号机的生产情况顿然改观了。产品合格率显著上升，到去年十二月份起开始达到和超过国家标准。今年一月份起，更消除了几年来没有断过的湿斑、起折子等毛病，生产指示牌上再也看不到令人痛心的“零”，而是月月都超额完成计划。这部年老的机器已生气勃勃地赶在其他几部造纸机的前面。今年五月，一号机提前六天完成了五月份的国家计划，使已经有十五个月没有完成过国家计划的利华造纸厂，在这个月第一次全面完成了国家计划，全厂人人喜气洋洋。今年六月份，全厂又超额百分之四完成国家计划，一号造纸机则超额百分之十五以上。
    利华造纸厂的职工们对一号机的看法已完全改变了，全厂的人都称赞一号机，造纸车间的工人们更加兴奋。最近，当我去访问利华造纸厂时，厂里的老工人奚顺福领我参观了一号机的厂房，“你看它生产得多有劲啊，真不比新机器差多少！”他指着面前轰轰地震响的一号机对我说。这时候，乳白色的纸浆正在均匀地流过一号机的铜网，流进机器。而在机器的另一端，洁白光滑的胶板印刷纸正像水流似地源源不绝地流出来。奚顺福顺手拿了几张纸，哗哗的抖了几下，赞叹着：“这是多么好的纸！你看，雪白，光滑，没有一点疤，拿去印画报是很好的啦！”
    利华造纸厂的职工们，现在已把一号造纸机大规模改建的计划全部打消了。他们觉得取消了这个浪费的计划，选择了发挥机器潜力的道路，这是党的政策的胜利，也是全厂职工的一个胜利。
