　　Some Experiences from Inspecting the Qinzhou Special District in Guangxi
　　National People's Congress Representative Lei Rongke
    The People's Republic of China will soon be six years old. In the past few years, due to our continuous glorious achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and various democratic reforms, our motherland has become increasingly strong, public security has been consolidated, the annual output of industry and agriculture has greatly exceeded the highest historical records, and people's lives have improved significantly. The First Session of the First National People's Congress was held last year, the Constitution was promulgated, and the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy will be reviewed and decided at the second session. At the same time, the great victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and various diplomatic achievements, have made our country's international status increasingly high. However, US imperialism still occupies our Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang still exists, and the counter-revolutionary elements in the classes that have been and will be eliminated will inevitably struggle to the death and try every means to undermine our cause. The enemy is not asleep! We have no reason to relax our vigilance against the enemy! I obtained many examples of this during this inspection of the Qinzhou Special District.
    The Qinzhou Special District faces the sea to the south, with a winding coastline stretching for 1,300 li, and large mountains to the northeast and northwest. Before liberation, these mountainous areas were areas where bandits roamed. In the years since the liberation of the mainland, the coastlines and borders of this area have been channels for enemy infiltration. During the bandit suppression period at the beginning of liberation, due to the heroic and arduous combat of our bandit suppression troops and the unity and cooperation of the people, banditry within the scope of this area has been basically eliminated, and public security has been very consolidated. However, since the restoration of peace in Indochina last year, on the one hand, due to the increase in our thoughts of complacency, which relaxed public security work; on the other hand, due to drought and frost last winter, winter crops and early-maturing crops failed, and our drought resistance and famine relief and grain supply work had certain shortcomings, giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, the enemy's counter-revolutionary activities have increased again. The enemy's methods of activity are diverse. Now, the main points are listed as follows:
    Armed bandits: From January to May this year, there were many counter-revolutionary bandit cases. In solving the cases, our public security forces arrested 231 criminals, killed 14, and 80 surrendered and repented. Enemy weapons seized included machine guns, rifles, pistols, hand grenades, machine gun shells, various bullets, and various knives. Among the enemy's documents seized were related defense documents, dispatch orders, notices, long strips, telegram drafts, bandit lists, bandit badges, and forged long strips from our district government. Each bandit gang had a small number of four or five people, and a large number of thirty or forty people, but each had its own pseudo-unit number, such as "China Freedom Army" and the like.
    The main leaders of these bandit gangs are mostly landlords, rich peasants, pseudo-staff, pseudo-military officers, and released criminals from labor reform. Most of the bandit gangs have connections with the Chiang bandit gang and are a political reactionary organization. They lurk in the mountains, taking advantage of the fact that our work of mobilizing the masses in this area in the past was not enough, they can obtain temporary shelter and places to carry out activities.
    Sabotaging transportation: On the more than 70-kilometer highway from Qinzhou County to Datang, there are 25 bridges. Enemy agents once removed part of the screws on the bridge piers. This incident was discovered early and did not cause disaster. In the past six months, the power lines in Qinxian County have been cut many times, and two power poles have been sawn off.
    Sabotaging agricultural production cooperatives: Before the spring of this year, 468 cooperatives were established in Hepu County. According to statistics from after the spring to May 4, six collapsed. The reason for the inspection is that most of them were bought by bad elements to buy off cooperative cadres, manipulate cooperative affairs, provoke members, or spread rumors to bring them down. Counter-revolutionary elements in Shuangtai Township, Third District, Hepu, specialize in stealing sweet potatoes from the township's cooperatives. One night, they even chopped and injured a cooperative member who was guarding the sweet potatoes. The Maoling Market Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the First District of Fangcheng was stolen more than 400 yuan in Renminbi, and an agricultural production cooperative in the same place was also stolen five plows, more than 500 catties of corn, and hundreds of yuan in Renminbi. It has been found that all of these were done by enemy agents.
    Sabotaging the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain: Fu Guoyong, a habitual bandit in Jianshan Township, Qinxian County, used chemical medicine to alter grain purchase certificates and illegally purchased thousands of catties of grain to distill private liquor. Before the case of the bandit leader Wu Chengkai in Lingshan was solved, his family had more than 20 dan of surplus grain and illegally purchased more than 1,000 catties of rice.
    In the past six months, reactionary leaflets and slogans have been continuously discovered in this area. In Duantian Township, Fifth District, Hepu, reactionary leaflets were discovered, inciting landlords to rebel.
    There are also many reactionary rumors. The content is mainly aimed at sabotaging our central work, publicizing the enemy's counter-offensive, and trying to arouse the peasants' thoughts of changing the world. For example, rumors that the US Air Force dropped atomic bombs, Zhejiang has been occupied, Guangzhou has fallen, inciting everyone to hoard food, etc. This area has been dry for a long time, and the enemy took the opportunity to spread rumors and incite.
    Although the enemy is very rampant, as long as we pay attention to mobilizing and educating the masses and raising the masses' vigilance, we can effectively combat counter-revolutionary elements. There is a story in Lingshan about an uncle designing to capture a bandit nephew, and there is also a story in Pubei about two farmers using sugarcane as rifles to capture a bandit leader at dusk. The reformed bandit Huang Bingquan said: "We are not afraid of the Communist Party coming to fight, but we are most afraid of the Communist Party holding meetings. The Communist Party explained the policies, and the masses will expose us, and we will not be able to find anything to eat, and there is only one way to surrender." It can be seen that improving the masses' political awareness and enthusiasm for struggle is indeed the most effective way to prevent bandit and spy activities.

　　在广西钦州专区视察中的一点体会
　　全国人民代表大会代表　雷荣珂
    中华人民共和国诞生将满六周年了。几年来，由于我们在镇压反革命、土地改革和民主改革的各种工作上，不断获得辉煌的成就，使祖国日益强盛，治安巩固，工农业的年产量已大大超过历史上最高的纪录，人民生活已显著提高。去年召开第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，公布了宪法，并且即将在第二次会议上审议决定发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。同时，抗美援朝的伟大胜利，和各种外交上的成就，使我国的国际地位也愈来愈高了。但现在美帝国主义还侵占着我们的台湾，蒋介石匪帮依旧存在，已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中的反革命分子，也必然要作垂死的挣扎，想尽方法来破坏我们的事业。敌人并没有睡着！我们没有任何理由可以对敌人放松警惕！我在这次视察钦州专区的过程中，得到了不少的例证。
    钦州专区南面为海洋，曲折的海岸线连绵达一千三百华里，东北面和西北面为大山。这些山岳地带，在解放前素为盗贼出没的区域。在全国大陆解放后，几年来，这地区的沿海岸线和边防线上，都可为敌人潜入的通道。在解放初剿匪期间，因我剿匪部队的英勇艰苦作战，和人民群众的团结合作，本地区范围内的匪患基本上已被肃清，治安已很巩固。但自去年印度支那恢复和平后，一方面由于我们的太平思想的增长，使治安工作松劲；他方面由于干旱和去冬的霜冻，冬种作物和早熟作物失收，加以我们的抗旱渡荒和粮食供应工作存在某些缺点，给敌人以可乘之机，所以敌人的反革命活动又多起来了。敌人活动的方式是多种多样的，现在择要举述如下：
    武装土匪：今年一月至五月，曾发生反革命土匪案件多起。在破案中，我公安部队逮捕案犯二百三十一人，击毙十四人，投案自新八十人。缴获敌人的武器有机枪、长短枪、手榴弹、机关炮弹，各种子弹和各种刀。在缴获敌人的证件中有关防、派令、通知单、长条、电报稿、匪名单、匪胸章和伪造我区政府长条等。每一股匪帮，人数少者四、五人，多者三、四十人，但都各有自己的伪番号，如：“中国自由军”之类。
    这些股匪的首要分子大都是地主、富农、伪职员、伪军官、劳改释放犯等。各股匪大都和蒋匪帮有联系，是一种政治性的反动组织。他们潜伏在山里，利用这地区过去我们发动群众的工作做得不够，可以获得暂时栖身和活动的场所。
    破坏交通：自钦县城到大塘七十多公里的公路上，有桥梁二十五座，敌特曾经将桥柱上的螺丝钉拔去一部分，这事件发觉得早，未酿成灾祸。半年来，钦县被割电线多次，且被锯断电杆木两条。
    破坏农业生产合作社：合浦县本年春前建社四百六十八个，春后至五月四日止统计，垮了六个。检查原因，大都是被坏分子收买社干部，操纵社务，挑拨社员或散播谣言等搞垮的。合浦第三区双泰乡的反革命分子，专门盗窃该乡合作社的番薯。有一夜竟把看守番薯的社员斫伤了。防城一区茅岭圩供销合作社被窃人民币四百多元，同地一农业生产合作社也被偷去犁耙五把，玉米五百多斤和人民币数百元，据查明都是敌特所为。
    破坏粮食统购统销政策：钦县尖山乡惯匪符国用化学药水涂改购粮证，套购了粮食数千斤，以蒸私酒。灵山匪首吴承楷家在未破案时，原积有余粮二十余担，套购了大米千多斤。
    这地区半年多来不断发现反动传单和标语。合浦五区端田乡，曾发现反动传单，煽动地主们造反。
    反动谣言也很多。内容主要是针对我们的中心工作进行破坏，宣传敌人的反攻，想引起农民的变天思想。如造谣说美国空军投下了原子弹，浙江已被占，广州已陷落，煽动大家囤积粮食等。这地区久旱不雨，敌人就趁机造谣煽惑。
    敌人虽然很猖狂，但只要我们注意发动和教育群众，提高群众的警惕性，我们就能够有效地打击反革命分子。灵山有舅父设计捉获土匪外甥的故事，浦北也有农民两人在黄昏时用计将甘蔗当步枪捉得匪首的故事。自新土匪黄炳权说：“不怕共产党来打，最怕共产党开会。共产党交代了政策，群众就会检举我们，我们也就无法找得东西来吃，只有投降一条路。”可见提高群众的政治觉悟和斗争积极性，确是防止匪特活动最有效的办法。
