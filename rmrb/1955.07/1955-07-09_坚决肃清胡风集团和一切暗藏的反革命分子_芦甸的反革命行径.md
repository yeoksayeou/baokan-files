Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Lu Dian's Counter-Revolutionary Actions
　　Zhang Xuexin Chen Yin
Mentioning Lu Dian, this loyal lackey of Hu Feng, one cannot suppress the hatred and anger in one's heart. It is hard to believe that there could be such an ugly and despicable soul in the world, but these are the facts, merely a part of the facts that have just been exposed.

Looking at Lu Dian's historical background, we can understand what kind of members the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was composed of, and what kind of dark "snake pit" the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was, a place that hid dirt and harbored evil. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Lu Dian's hometown, Jiangxi, was the center of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and Lu Dian participated in counter-revolutionary activities. In 1934, he was admitted to the Kuomintang's cadre training institute. After graduating, he first worked as a "training officer" for the "anti-communist" Baojia system. Later, because of his "meritorious anti-communist service," he became the pseudo-Lianbao Director, brutally beating peasants, extorting money, and acting as a tyrant, doing everything imaginable. In the winter of 1935, he was admitted to the pseudo-Nanjing Training Corps. After six months of training, he was sent to the pseudo-Hangzhou Training Corps as a squad leader, and he went to Bengbu to recruit new soldiers for the Kuomintang. In 1937, he was recommended to the 14th class of the pseudo-Whampoa Military Academy for "advanced studies," where he joined the Kuomintang, was inspected by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, and listened to Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. Later, he received training as a pseudo-political worker and served as a squad leader and instructor at the Kuomintang Central Military Academy. This is the true face of this Hu Feng confidant.

While at the pseudo-Central Military Academy, Lu Dian became acquainted with the Hu Feng elements of the "July" Society and participated in the activities of the "Modern Literature Society" hosted by Hu Feng elements Fang Ran, Xie Tao, and others. Before he infiltrated our Central Plains Liberated Area in 1945, he "specially" went to Hu Feng's home in Chongqing to "visit," and A'long got him a passport to pass through the Chiang-controlled areas. During the Central Plains Breakout in 1946, he disguised himself and returned to the Chiang-controlled areas. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he stayed at the home of Hu Feng element Ji Fang, and then he met Hu Feng and claimed that he had re-established contact with the Liberated Area through Hu Feng.

When Lu Dian entered the Liberated Area for the second time, he immediately became close to Lu Li with two "July Poetry Series" and a set of "Hope" magazines, and established a "relationship" with him, and used this to participate in the work of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles. At this time, he fully used double-dealing tactics, pretending to be "pure" and "honest," and won people's trust. In this way, this counter-revolutionary element, while concealing his participation in the Kuomintang and other reactionary history, was introduced and assisted by Lu Li and sneaked into the Party.

After entering Tianjin, he usurped the position of Secretary-General of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles and began to act wildly. On the one hand, he secretly slandered and vilified the Party's literary and artistic leadership and progressive writers, both Party and non-Party members, and on the other hand, he openly promoted Hu Feng everywhere and publicized Hu Feng's reactionary theories. He once publicly shouted: "Beijing has suppressed new poetry to death, we must fight." After Hu Feng's "Time Has Begun" was published, he immediately wrote to Hu Feng to express his "congratulations." In order to "ignite" things in Tianjin, he personally went to radio stations, theaters, and schools to recite this reactionary poem. In 1950, he acted as a voluntary salesman for Hu Feng, running around selling a large number of books of the Hu Feng clique that had been backlogged for many years. For this matter, A'long wrote to Hu Feng many times to "report his merits," saying: "Brother Dian has won another great victory."

In order to turn Tianjin into a strong "base" for Hu Feng's counter-revolution, under Hu Feng's instruction, he and Lu Li jointly wrote a letter inviting A'long to work in Tianjin. As soon as A'long arrived in Tianjin, he accompanied A'long to visit various places and shamelessly publicized: "Yi Men is one of the few theorists in China," and "The revolutionary literature and art of the rear area was led by Hu Feng and Yi Men and a few others." Under his "efforts," A'long quickly obtained the editorial position of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles' journal, and even the "final decision-making power for editorial affairs." As for "liaisons" and "converts," Lu Dian spared no effort. He seized on several young cadres of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles who had ideological problems and poor character, provoked their dissatisfaction and confrontation with the leadership, and cultivated their blind worship of Hu Feng and A'long, forming the so-called "Four King Kongs" that were controlled and utilized by A'long and Lu Dian, creating the so-called "Tianjin Literature and Art" (the 1951 journal of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles) situation of "Commander A'long, Central Army Lu Dian, and Four Little Flags Feng (Dahai) Li (Li) He (Ku) Yu (Xiao)." Coupled with Lu Li, a Hu Feng element who had usurped the position of director of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles at that time, the organ of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles at that time almost became a "one-color" Hu Feng position, a "strong" base for the Hu Feng clique to oppose the Party and revolution. No wonder Hu Feng was ecstatic in his secret letters, greatly praising Tianjin's "literary fortune."

In order to make the counter-revolutionary elements penetrate into our "liver," Lu Dian had been trying to pull A'long into the Communist Party. Usually, he praised A'long in front of everyone as "sincere," "humble," and "worthy of being a teacher," creating a "mass base" for A'long. Before the Party group discussed A'long's application to join the Party, he secretly incited the "Party members" among the "Four King Kongs." At the group meeting, Lu Dian passionately "escorted" A'long, saying that A'long "had been following the revolution for more than ten years and had always stood at the forefront of revolutionary literature and art in the rear area," "He was someone who had broken out of the old society," and "He had always been active and responsible in his work in the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles." Under his incitement, the "King Kongs" also sang praises to A'long, and Feng Dahai even shamelessly said: "A'long's Party spirit is even higher than that of some Party members." At the meeting, some comrades raised questions about A'long's "unclear history" and errors in his literary and artistic thought, but Lu Dian refuted them, saying: "A'long has not violated Chairman Mao's direction in literature and art," and "Theoretical issues cannot be regarded as political issues." After the meeting, he cursed these comrades as "narrow-minded peasants." A'long's application to join the Party was not approved, and the counter-revolutionary elements failed to drill in as they wished, which aroused Lu Dian's despicable hatred of the Party. He even encouraged A'long to file a complaint with the Party Central Committee about this matter.

In Tianjin for several years, Lu Dian consistently sowed discord, undermined unity, and carried out planned anti-Party and anti-leadership criminal activities. Once, the Party journal criticized him and another cadre of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles for shielding A'long's mistakes. He took the opportunity to sow discord, saying that this was a fabrication and personal revenge, and that it must have been done by so-and-so, and incited the "Four King Kongs" and their small followers to write many anonymous letters to slander and "accuse." After Dong Naixiang, an amateur Tianjin worker-writer, was sent back by the Central Institute of Literature for making mistakes, he took the opportunity to sow discord: "You are from the working class, you can't get along with those petty bourgeois. They are using dogmatism to deceive you." And he tried to pull Dong Naixiang into becoming A'long's "follower." During the literary rectification in 1951, the responsible comrades of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles had serious bourgeois ideological influences and that the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers was not clear. This touched the pain of this group of counter-revolutionary elements, and Lu Dian incited dissatisfaction with the municipal committee everywhere, cursing the leadership as "not wanting culture" and "not understanding literature and art," and wrote a report opposing the municipal committee and the Party's literary and artistic policies, which he submitted to the municipal committee in the name of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Party branch. This report was not seen by any other Party members, but it was "approved" and revised by A'long.

This poisonous snake, hanging the signboard of "Party member," faithfully carried out the "Sun Wukong drilling into the belly" tactic. He tried every means to steal Party documents for Hu Feng and find out Party secrets. He took almost every Party document he could see to Hu Feng's place for a few days; if he couldn't see it, he tried to steal it in secret. His "circulation" of Party documents to Hu Feng had almost become a "system." When he was about to leave Beijing to go to the countryside, Hu Feng openly asked him: "What will I do about reading documents when you leave?" Then he ordered him: "Ask your wife to bring them." In his own words, "Everything I knew, whether it was beneficial or detrimental to Hu Feng, I told him." The facts fully prove that Lu Dian was originally a mole of the counter-revolutionary clique who had infiltrated the Party. He even frequently secretly reported the remarks and actions of other Hu Feng elements, especially those who suspected or were dissatisfied with Hu Feng, to Hu Feng. Like all counter-revolutionary cliques, they depended on each other for survival, flattered each other, and competed for power and profit, and attacked each other. Lu Dian, this unlearned, despicable, insidious, and treacherous counter-revolutionary element, was able to gain Hu Feng's favor and trust by these utterly servile means.

This obsequious lackey, towards the Party, was completely a vicious and ferocious person. From A'long's secret letters to Hu Feng, we found that he offered advice and suggestions for everything the Hu Feng clique did. He not only offered advice in secret letters, but also directly participated in various conspiracies of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In 1953, A'long's accusation against the Party was discussed at his home. He was responsible for convening the secret meeting, and he was the one who came forward to mediate and reconcile the party members when they had disagreements at the meeting.

In Beijing, he also actively "liaisoned" and "won over" people to develop the organization. He introduced Feng Dahai and Li Li, two of the "Four King Kongs," to Hu Feng, turning them into Hu Feng's loyal followers. He also repeatedly invited others whom he had taken a liking to go to Hu Feng's home to "play," and proactively copied and left Hu Feng's address and phone number for others.

During the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, he participated in a series of gatherings of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. They met secretly at Hu Feng's home every night to study plans to sabotage the congress and collectively discuss attacks on comrades such as Zhou Yang and He Qifang. After the Second Congress of Literary and Art Workers, following Hu Feng's instructions, he went to Shanghai and Hangzhou to convey Hu Feng's new strategic policies after the Second Congress of Literary and Art Workers to Hu Feng elements Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao, and Fang Ran, and encouraged the party members to further attack the Party under the guise of "prospering creation" and "criticism of criticism."

Lu Dian was one of the drafters of Hu Feng's "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues," which was an attack on the Party. He and Lu Ling, Lü Yuan, Xie Tao, Ouyang Zhuang, and others read the draft chapter by chapter, provided comments. Lu Dian painstakingly came up with ideas for the "Opinions." He suggested that Hu Feng add a little "self-criticism" to deceive the Central Committee. He also organized his wife and others to help copy the original manuscript of the "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues." In short, he had great hopes for this anti-Party program of the Hu Feng clique, vainly hoping to make it more "perfect" and more viciously attack the Party.

In order to cooperate with Hu Feng's attack in the "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues," Lu Dian also submitted a "complaint" to the Party. He questioned the Party: "Why did He Qifang say that Hu Feng's thinking was bourgeois?" "Hu Feng is not a bad person, why is it a problem to approach him?" His "complaint" was also discussed by Hu Feng's core members. After his "complaint" was submitted, the leading comrades wrote him a letter criticizing him, pointing out that Hu Feng was reactionary. After his wife received this letter, she immediately sent it to Hu Feng's home.

After Hu Feng's "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" were submitted to the Central Committee, Lu Dian was both surprised and pleased, and frequently went to Hu Feng's home to inquire about the situation. Last November, at the enlarged joint meeting of the Presidium of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, Hu Feng launched a frenzied attack on the Party. Lu Dian was overjoyed when he heard the news and prepared to immediately write articles to cooperate with the "general offensive." At this time, Lu Dian appeared arrogant and invincible in front of people, as if the world had become the "Hu family's" from then on.

After the movement to criticize Hu Feng's thought was launched nationwide, Lu Dian immediately turned around and changed course by "one hundred and eighty degrees" when he saw that the wind was not right, and told everyone he met that "Hu Feng was wrong." He actively participated in all symposiums and discussions, and wrote "notes" criticizing Hu Feng, and made "passionate" and hoarse speeches at the meetings. He also seriously suggested to the leadership not to ask A'long to go to Beijing to listen to Comrade Yang Xianzhen's report, so as to avoid him meeting Hu Feng again. And he voluntarily requested to help A'long "reflect" and constantly reported A'long's ideological situation to the organization, saying that A'long's "attitude was sincere" and that he was "willing to conduct a review." After April, he took the initiative to report to the Party organization, claiming that he had "blindly worshiped Hu Feng in the past," that he "wanted to draw a clear line with Hu Feng," and that he "wanted to thoroughly explain his problems," appearing very "sincere" and "painful."

But the facts proved that all this was a disguise, a complete illusion, and that all this was carrying out Hu Feng's retreating tactics. It turned out that while he was scolding Hu Feng at the meetings, he frequently went to Hu Feng's home to "tip him off" and "listen to instructions." In January, February, March, and April of this year, he "saw" Hu Feng more than fourteen or five times. He reported all the news he heard, "whether it was beneficial or detrimental to Hu Feng," to Hu Feng. Every time he went to Beijing to listen to a "materialist" report, he had to go to Hu Feng's home. His suggestion "not to ask A'long to go to Beijing to listen to the report" was originally to cover up his conspiracy. His helping A'long "conduct a review" was originally to gain a legitimate position to carry out conspiracy activities with A'long. His reporting A'long's ideological situation to the Party was originally to feel out the "bottom line" of the leadership. A'long's completely hypocritical and malicious false review was also "reviewed" and revised by him.

Why did he "explain the problem" to the Party organization in April? It turned out that Hu Feng and Lu Ling had received "intelligence" that someone had reported Lu Dian, so they "summoned" him, gave him confidential instructions, and told him to "proactively" conduct a false review. At that time, Lu Ling told him "only talk about yourself, don't talk about others, and absolutely don't expose Xie Tao." He completely carried out this "instruction." As a result, his "proactive" explanation was only about "having met a few times," "not having met anyone else," and "only talking about literary and art issues when we met," and so on.

As the movement deepened, the Party wanted him to honestly explain the problem. He only explained some minor problems, avoiding the important ones, but pretended to have racked his brains, tearfully guaranteeing to the Party that "there is nothing more," and saying things like "I feel the warmth of the Party," "What good is it to me to stand on the position of individualism and not tell the truth?" "In the past, I was not loyal to the Party, but now I am absolutely loyal to the Party, please believe me." The Party had already become accustomed to his face at this time and did not believe his false review that avoided the important and emphasized the minor. But it was not expected that at this time, his several formal "introspection" materials submitted to the Party branch had also been personally revised by A'long. A'long told him not to mention a certain person, so he crossed it out.

After the "People's Daily" exposed the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and called on "everyone who has mixed with Hu Feng and has secret letters should also hand them over," Lu Dian opened several drawers in front of people, pretending to look for a while, but said: "I rarely corresponded with Hu Feng, only a few daily greeting letters, and I didn't save them." But everyone has now seen that they exchanged not a few secret letters, but dozens of them. Their letters were not "daily greetings," but were intended to give the Party and the people "a blow from behind"; and were studying the "arduousness and long-term nature of their struggle."

At this time, he pretended to be moved by the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique exposed by the "People's Daily," put on a self-struggle and determination face, and told the story of his wife copying the draft of Hu Feng's "Opinions," and then expressed "I have told about my wife, what else do I want to keep." As a result, he still kept it! He kept his "promise" to the "old man," and kept "Xie Tao" and many important counter-revolutionary activity materials.

Now the mouth of the poisonous snake has been pried open, and the painted skin of the ghoul has been peeled off. The true face of Lu Dian, this core member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, can no longer be hidden!

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
　　芦甸的反革命行径
　　张学新　陈因
    提起芦甸这个胡风的忠实走狗，就抑制不住心里的憎恶和愤怒。很难相信，天下竟有这样丑恶、卑鄙的灵魂，但这些是事实，仅仅是刚被揭发出来的事实的一部分。
    看一看芦甸的历史出身，我们可以了解胡风反革命集团到底是一些什么样的成员组成的，胡风反革命集团是一个怎样藏垢纳污的黑暗的“蛇窟”。第二次国内革命战争期间，芦甸的家乡江西是革命同反革命斗争的中心，芦甸就参加了反革命的活动。一九三四年，他就考入了国民党的干部人员养成所，毕业以后，先担任了一段“反共”保甲的“训练工作”，以后就因“反共有功”，当了伪联保主任，毒打农民，敲诈勒索，作威作福，无所不为。一九三五年冬又考入伪南京教导总队，受训六个月后，被派到伪杭州集训总队任班长，曾到蚌埠为国民党招募新兵。一九三七年又被保送入伪黄埔军校十四期“深造”，在那里参加了国民党，并受过蒋贼的检阅，听过蒋贼的训话。以后又受过伪政工人员训练，担任过国民党中央军官学校的分队长、指导员等职务。这就是这个胡风亲信的本来面目。
    芦甸在伪中央军校时，就结识了“七月”社的胡风分子们，并参加了胡风分子方然、谢韬等主持的“现代文学社”的活动。一九四五年他混入我中原解放区之前，曾“特意”到重庆胡风家去“拜访”，并由阿垅给他弄了通过蒋管区的护照。一九四六年中原突围时，他化装转移，又回到蒋管区，一到上海就住到胡风分子冀汸家里，接着就拜见了胡风，并自称通过胡风才接上了回到解放区的关系。
    芦甸第二次进入解放区时，凭着两本“七月诗丛”，一套“希望”杂志，马上同鲁藜一见如故，接上“关系”，并借此参加了晋冀鲁豫边区文联的工作。这时，他充分地使用了两面手段，装着一副
  “纯洁”“正直”的面孔，骗取了人们的信任。这样，这个反革命分子就在隐瞒了参加国民党等反动历史的情况下，经过鲁藜的介绍和帮助，混进党内。
    进入天津以后，他窃取了天津文协秘书长的职务，便大肆活动起来。一面暗地里到处谩骂污蔑党的文艺领导和党和非党的进步作家，一面公开地到处给胡风捧场，宣传胡风的反动理论。他曾公开地叫喊：“北京方面把新诗都压死了，我们要战斗。”胡风的“时间开始了”发表以后，他马上给胡风写信表示“祝贺”。为了要在天津“烧起了”，他亲自跑到电台、剧院、学校各处去朗诵这首反动的诗。一九五○年，他给胡风当义务推销员，各处奔走，出卖积压多年的胡风集团的大批书籍。为此事，阿垅曾向胡风多次写信，给他“报功”说：“甸兄又打了一个大胜仗。”
    为了把天津变成胡风反革命的有力“据点”，在胡风授意下，他同鲁藜联名写信邀请阿垅来天津工作。阿垅一到天津，他就陪着阿垅到各处登门拜访，并到处无耻地宣传：“亦门是中国少有的理论家”、“大后方的革命文艺就是胡风、亦门几个人领导的”。就在他这样的“努力”下，使阿垅很快取得了天津文协机关刊物的编辑地位，以至“编务最后决定权”。对于“联络人”、“争取人”，芦甸更是不遗余力。他抓住当时天津文协几个思想上有毛病和品质恶劣的青年干部，挑起他们对领导的不满、对抗，培养他们对胡风、阿垅的盲目崇拜，形成了为阿垅、芦甸掌握利用的所谓“四大金刚”，造成了当时所谓“天津文艺”（一九五一年的天津文联刊物）的“主帅阿垅，中军芦甸，四小旗冯（大海）李（离）何（苦）余（晓）”的局面。加上当时窃取了天津文协主任职务的胡风分子鲁藜，那时的文协机关差不多变成了“清一色”的胡风阵地，成了胡风集团反党反革命的“坚强”据点。无怪乎胡风在密信中对天津的“文运”得意忘形地大加表扬了。
    为了要使反革命分子深入到我们的“肝脏里面来”，芦甸一直在想法把阿垅拉进共产党内。平时他就在大家面前称赞阿垅“真诚”、“虚心”、“可为人师”，替阿垅制造“群众基础”，党小组讨论阿垅入党问题以前，他更秘密找“四大金刚”中的
  “党员”进行鼓动。小组会上，芦甸慷慨激昂地为阿垅“保驾”，说阿垅“追随革命十几年，在大后方一直站在革命文艺的最前哨”，“他是一个人从旧社会里冲出来的”，“在天津文联工作，一贯积极负责”。“金刚”们在他的鼓动下也都给阿垅唱起了赞歌，冯大海甚至无耻地说：“阿垅比一些党员的党性还高”。会上有些同志提出了阿垅的“历史不清”和文艺思想的错误，芦甸就加以反驳，说：
  “阿垅并没有违背毛主席的文艺方向”，“理论问题不能当成政治问题”。散会后又大骂这些同志是
  “狭隘的农民意识”。阿垅的入党申请没有通过，反革命分子没有能如意地钻进来，激起了芦甸对党的卑鄙的仇恨，他竟鼓动阿垅为此事向党中央提出控诉。
    芦甸在天津几年来一贯挑拨离间，破坏团结，进行着有计划的反党反领导的罪恶活动。一次，党刊上批评了他和文联的另一个干部包庇阿垅的错误，他就乘机挑拨，说这是无中生有，私人报复，一定是某某人搞的，并鼓动“四大金刚”和他们的一些小喽啰，写了许多匿名信进行污蔑、“控告”。天津工人业余写作者董乃相因犯了错误被中央文学研究所送回来以后，他就乘机挑拨：“你是工人阶级，跟他们小资产阶级合不来。他们拿教条主义诓你。”并且企图把董乃相拉成阿垅的“信徒”。一九五一年文艺整风时，中共天津市委负责同志指出天津文联有严重的资产阶级思想影响，为工农兵服务的方针不明确。这下触着了这批反革命分子的痛处，芦甸就到处煽动对市委的不满，谩骂领导“不要文化”，“不懂文艺”，并写了一份反对市委、反对党的文艺政策的报告，盗用了天津文联党支部名义送交市委。这个报告未经任何其他党员看过，但却经过了阿垅的“批准”和修改。
    这个挂着“党员”招牌的毒蛇，忠实地执行着“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”。他千方百计地给胡风盗窃党内文件、探听党内机密。他能看到的党内文件，差不多每本都要拿到胡风那里放几天；他看不到的，就设法阴谋窃取。他给胡风“传阅”党内文件几乎已经形成“制度”。当他要下乡离开北京时，胡风竟公然问他：“你走了，我看文件怎么办？”接着又命令他：“叫你老婆拿来吧。”用他自己的话说，就是“凡是我所知道的一切机密，不管对胡风有利或无利，我都告诉他。”事实完全证明了，芦甸原来是一个钻进党内的反革命集团的坐探。他甚至还经常把其他胡风分子的言论、行动，特别是对胡风的怀疑、不满，偷偷密告给胡风。像一切反革命集团一样，他们相依为命，互相吹捧，而又争权夺利，互相倾轧。芦甸这个不学无术卑鄙阴险的反革命分子，就是凭着这些十足的奴才手段而取得胡风的宠爱和信任的。
    这个卑躬屈膝的奴才，对党则是完全一副狠毒、凶恶的心肠。从阿垅给胡风的密信中，我们发现胡风集团的任何一件事情，他都要出谋献策。他不但在密信中献计，而且直接参加了胡风反革命集团各种的阴谋活动。一九五三年，阿垅向党进攻的控告书，就是在他家里集会讨论的，密会就是他负责召集的，党羽们在会上闹了别扭，是他出面调停和解的。
    在北京他也积极地“联络人”、“争取人”，发展组织。他把“四大金刚”中的冯大海、李离引见给胡风，使这两人变成了胡风的忠实走卒。他还三番五次地邀请他所看中的其他一些人到胡风家去
  “玩”，主动地给别人抄留胡风的地址和电话号码。
    中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会期间，他参加了一系列胡风反革命集团的集会。他们每天晚上在胡风家秘密集会，研究对大会的破坏计划，集体讨论对周扬、何其芳等同志的攻击。第二次文代会后，他按着胡风的指示，到上海、杭州向胡风分子罗洛、张中晓、方然等人传达了胡风在第二次文代会后的新的战略方针，鼓励党羽们在“繁荣创作”和“对批评的批评”的掩盖下，进一步向党进攻。
    芦甸是胡风向党进攻的“对文艺问题的意见”书的起草人之一。他同路翎、绿原、谢韬、欧阳庄等人逐章逐段地传阅草稿，提供意见。芦甸煞费苦心地替“意见书”出主意。他建议胡风加上一点
  “自我检讨”，以欺骗中央。他还组织他的老婆等帮助抄写“对文艺问题的意见”书原稿。总之，他对胡风集团这个反党纲领抱有极大的希望，妄想搞得“完善”一点，更恶毒地向党进攻。
    芦甸为了配合胡风“对文艺问题的意见”书的进攻，也向党递上了“申诉书”。他向党质问：“何其芳为什么说胡风是资产阶级思想？”“胡风又不是坏人，为什么接近他就有问题？”他的“申诉”也经过了胡风骨干分子的讨论。他的“申诉”交上以后，领导同志写信对他批评，指出胡风是反动的。他老婆接到这封信后，就马上送到胡风家里。
    胡风的“对文艺问题的意见”书送交中央后，芦甸是又惊又喜，经常到胡风家探听情况。去年十
  一月，在中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上，胡风向党作了疯狂的进攻，芦甸听到消息欢欣若狂，并且准备马上写文章来配合
  “总攻”。这时，芦甸在人们面前表现得趾高气扬，不可一世，好像天下从此已是“胡家”的了。
    批判胡风思想运动在全国展开以后，芦甸一看风头不对，马上顺风转舵，转了个“一百八十度的弯子”，见人就讲“胡风错了”。他积极地参加一切座谈会、讨论会，并写了“批判”胡风的“箚记”，在会上做了“慷慨激昂”声嘶力竭的发言。他还曾一本正经地向领导上建议，不要叫阿垅到北京听杨献珍同志的报告，免得他又同胡风见面。并且自动要求帮助阿垅“反省”，还不断地向组织上反映阿垅的思想情况，说阿垅“态度诚恳”、“愿意进行检讨”。四月以后他更主动向党组织汇报，扬言“过去盲目崇拜过胡风”，“要同胡风划清界限”，“要彻底交代自己的问题”，样子显得非常
  “真诚”“沉痛”。
    但事实证明，这一切完全是伪装，完全是假象，这一切都是在执行胡风的退却战术。原来他一面在会上大骂胡风，一面却经常到胡风家去“通风报信”“听取指示”，今年一、二、三、四月内，他
  “晋见”胡风竟在十四、五次以上。把他听到的
  “对胡风有利或无利”的消息统统汇报给了胡风。每次他到北京听“唯物主义”报告时，都要到胡风家里。他的“不要叫阿垅到北京听报告”的建议，原来正是为了掩护他的阴谋活动。他的帮助阿垅
  “进行检讨”，原来是想取得同阿垅进行阴谋活动的合法地位。他向党汇报阿垅思想情况，原来是为了摸领导上的“底”。阿垅的那篇完全虚伪的充满恶意的假检讨，也是由他“审查”修改的。
    他为什么要在四月份向党组织“交代问题”呢？原来是胡风、路翎得到了“情报”，说有人检举了芦甸，于是他们“召见”了他，面授机密以后，叫他“主动”地进行假检讨。那时路翎告诉他
  “只谈自己，不要谈旁人，绝对不许暴露谢韬”。他完全执行了这个“指示”，结果他的“主动”交代只是一些“只见过几次面呀”，“没见过别人呀”，“见面只谈谈文艺问题呀”等等。
    运动深入展开了，党要他老老实实交代问题。他只避重就轻地交代了一些枝节问题，却装着已经挖空心思的样子，痛哭流涕地向党保证“再也没有了”，并说什么“我感到了党的温暖”，“我就是站在个人主义的立场不讲对我有什么好处？”“过去我对党不忠实，现在我对党绝对忠实，请党相信我。”党这时已经看惯了他那副嘴脸，不相信他的避重就轻的假检讨了。但却没有想到就在这个时候，他的向党支部交代的几次正式“反省”材料，也都是经过阿垅亲自动手修改过的。阿垅叫他不要提哪一个人，他就勾去。
    “人民日报”揭发了胡风反革命集团的材料并号召“一切和胡风混在一起而得有密信的人也应当交出来”，芦甸当着人们开了几个抽屉，装模作样地找了一会儿，却说：“我与胡风很少通信，只有几封日常问候信，也没有保存。”但大家现在已看到，他们来往的密信不是几封，而是几十封，他们的信不是什么“日常问候”，而是要给党和人民“一个闷棍吃吃”；而是在研究他们“战斗的坚苦性和长期性”。
    这时他又假装着好像被“人民日报”揭发的胡风反革命集团的材料感动了，摆出一副自我斗争和痛下决心的样子，讲出了他老婆抄过胡风“意见书”的稿子的事情，接着就表白“我把我老婆都讲了，还有什么要保留”。结果他还是保留了！保留了对“老头子”的“诺言”，保留了“谢韬”和许多重要的反革命活动材料。
    现在毒蛇的洞口掀开了，狞鬼的画皮剥掉了。芦甸这个胡风反革命集团的骨干分子的真面目是再也隐藏不住了！
