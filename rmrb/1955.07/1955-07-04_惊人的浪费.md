Astonishing Waste
Zhao Zhenzhong

　　The State-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as the No. 2 Cotton Factory), in accordance with the instructions of the Hebei Textile Industry Administration Bureau, the criticism of the Hebei Daily, and the resolution of the National Conference of Directors of State-owned Textile Factories on carrying out the anti-waste struggle, inspected and criticized the waste in its self-funded investment. Preliminary calculations show that the waste and stockpiling total more than one million yuan. This figure is roughly equal to the sum of the three additional self-funded investment plans of the No. 2 Cotton Factory. That is to say, the money that the factory repeatedly requested from the state was unnecessarily wasted.

　　In April of last year, a technical design book was sent to the preparatory office of the No. 2 Cotton Factory. Some leaders of the preparatory office believed that the No. 1 Cotton Factory was built earlier and was half the size of the No. 2 Cotton Factory, yet it was so "grand." Could the No. 2 Cotton Factory be inferior to it? The state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin were taken over from the bureaucratic capital of old China and were also so particular. How could a large factory established by New China be "backward"? Moreover, "If the interior is not decorated well, how can it match the magnificent buildings and modern machinery and equipment?"

　　Why was the preparatory office, which managed capital construction, so concerned about the internal decoration? Because the preparatory office was the administrative body after the factory was built. They always hoped to use the basic construction investment to buy everything they needed now, so that it would be convenient to use in the future.

　　How to ask the state for money? They had many "tricks." One important "trick" was not to act according to the plan and violate the principle of using special funds for special purposes. They gave it a moving name, called "internal balancing." The result was often that the money was "balanced" away, but it was discovered that some money that had to be spent was gone. Then they applied for additional funds, "If it is not approved, it will affect the work." This was the reason for repeatedly requesting additional budgets.

　　Since they were unwilling to lag behind and had the magic weapons of "internal balancing" and "applying for additional funds," they went all out. Later, with the support, connivance, and tacit approval of the leaders, this wave of "going all out" became more and more turbulent, so that the allocation indicators, financial control, and the savings tasks arranged by the higher authorities could not stop it.

　　Let's see how they spent the money!

　　Those who have seen the movie "Far from Moscow" must still remember the dispatching desk in the engineer's office—a microphone and a loudspeaker. In front of the dispatching desk, the leaders could directly talk to the various work areas hundreds of miles away, issue instructions, and listen to reports. Zhang Tianxing, the director of the preparatory office, insisted on "having such a set" regardless of his actual conditions. Coincidentally, the Ministry of Textile Industry was also planning to select a factory across the country to demonstrate the dispatching work, so this request was approved. The planned amount was about 25,000 yuan. They sent the chief of the power department to Shanghai to pick the best imported goods and bought one. They bought it, but because they didn't understand the technology, the dispatching desk had been sleeping in the warehouse for several months. In the future, inviting someone from Shanghai to install it will cost at least 40,000 yuan in total. And a domestically produced dispatching desk recently installed in a factory in Tianjin cost only more than 10,000 yuan.

　　Another "masterpiece" of the No. 2 Cotton Factory was a large transportation vehicle. The car was converted from an old truck in Tianjin. The original equipment and decoration were already beautiful and exquisite enough. However, the personnel of the general affairs department in charge of the modification still felt that it was not outstanding enough, and without the approval of the director, they installed a radio and an amplifier in the car without authorization. In this way, "it can be used as a transportation vehicle and a propaganda vehicle," and it will naturally be majestic when it is driven out. However, this "masterpiece," including the cost of buying the old car and the modification fee, amounted to 42,000 yuan, which is almost equivalent to the price of three brand-new Soviet trucks.

　　The furnishings in the factory's office are also quite exquisite. When the factory construction project was in full swing, Zhang Tianxing instructed the general affairs department: "Make the conference room and reception room better." For this "better," the staff of the general affairs department really spent a lot of effort. The camp construction department of the preparatory office could make a set of sofas for 160 yuan, but it could only be made of velvet, which was not as "decent" as leather sofas; originally, the chemical floor was comfortable enough, but wouldn't it be better to lay a carpet on it? So the chief of the general affairs department went to Tianjin and spent 2,100 yuan to buy five sets of leather sofas and one set of velvet sofas; he spent 390 yuan to buy four carpets. The reception room and conference room looked good, but the office looked too shabby in comparison. "Let's all be comfortable!" So he spent more than 1,500 yuan to make fifty-two small velvet sofas, and spent more than 300 yuan to buy some "ordinary" flowers and plants and put them in each department.

　　In order to pursue beauty and exquisiteness, many instruments such as ammeters, power factor meters, screw wrenches, etc., which were originally available in China and could be used completely, the chief of the power department still bought many foreign products. Even the hair clippers and razors in the barber shop had to be imported. The chief of the public utilities department even complained that the domestically produced large barber mirrors "could not show the true color," and did not hesitate to spend five or six times the price to buy foreign mirrors.

　　The small wooden stools made for the staff dormitory are currently more than three for each staff member, and even if all the staff are fully staffed two years later, they will not be able to distribute one to each person. There are more than 20 departments in the factory, but there are more than 160 velvet armchairs specially made for the department-level staff.

　　Such things may seem unbelievable, but the two chiefs of the general affairs department who presided over this matter had their own plans: "If the quantity is large, it will be convenient to use in the future. If it really doesn't work, we can sell it to the future third and fourth factories. Anyway, selling things in the future is much easier than asking the superiors for money to buy things."

　　The factory also has a lot of medical equipment, X-ray machines, ultra-short wave electrotherapy machines, sun lamps, universal delivery beds, refrigerators, and even dental, ophthalmology, ENT, and surgical medical equipment, etc., costing a total of 34,000 yuan. Before buying this medical equipment, although everyone knew that there would soon be a unified hospital for the first and second factories, and the factory itself did not need so much medical equipment, the chief of the health department still declared: "We want to solve all the problems of the patients in the factory without going out!" This huge purchase plan was supported by the directors. The X-ray machine, which accounted for half of the total health equipment, was personally approved by Deputy Director Huo Xiangxin. Recently, the Hebei Textile Administration Bureau pointed out in its inspection that they bought too much and too complete, and the amount of money exceeded the central government's regulations. Section Chief Yu of the Health Section was still very dissatisfied.

　　Since other aspects are so exquisite and complete, the equipment of the laboratory "serving production" should be more exquisite and complete. There is even such a thing: when the Ministry of Textile Industry asked the No. 2 Cotton Factory to make a foreign order plan so that the ministry could order it uniformly, a responsible comrade from the factory's cloth workshop heard that a new "flash tachometer" was made abroad, worth more than 1,500 yuan, and he said: "Buy one, let's see what that thing is!" So he applied for ordering. According to the preliminary inspection by the Hebei Textile Administration Bureau, about 20,000 yuan worth of instruments in the yarn and cloth workshop laboratories are dispensable. The bureau proposed that some instruments should be reduced, but some leaders of the yarn and cloth workshop believed that this was not an inspection, but that people from the bureau wanted to increase their experimental instruments to find the No. 2 Cotton Factory's advantage, and therefore expressed great dissatisfaction.

　　The No. 2 Cotton Factory is a new stall that has just been established, and there are many difficulties. To do a good job, we must work hard to overcome difficulties. But some generous leaders believe that spending more money can "overcome difficulties."

　　The No. 2 Cotton Factory originally had three temporary canteens: one in the dormitory, one in the factory, and one in the middle of the factory and the dormitory. Originally, according to the area of the canteen and the number of diners, three canteens were enough, but because of poor management, there were often some canteens that were too crowded, and people had a lot of opinions. Some people asked the general affairs department for money to build a new canteen. The people in the general affairs department felt that they could not afford it and did not agree to build it. The lawsuit went to Director Zhang Tianxing. Director Zhang approved without asking questions: "Allow the expenditure, and the specific project will be decided after completion." In February of this year, a temporary canteen costing more than 7,000 yuan was built. But because other canteens are still poorly managed, the crowding phenomenon has not been eliminated. And the new canteen was also idle after selling two mornings of meals because the food was not well-run.

　　In order to recover these serious losses and eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology on the factory construction work, the No. 2 Cotton Factory accepted criticisms from all parties, and successively held party committee meetings, section chief cadre meetings, and general staff meetings to examine the phenomenon of extravagance and waste. Zhang Tianxing and other responsible staff members made self-criticisms and took some specific measures to reduce six non-productive construction projects, reduce the stock of machinery and materials worth hundreds of thousands of yuan in the yarn and cloth workshop, save greening costs, and send the surplus sofas, carpets, trucks, beds, stools, etc. to the warehouse for storage, ready to be sold to other units in need or transferred to higher authorities. According to preliminary calculations, a loss of 1.4 million yuan can be recovered.

　　惊人的浪费
　　赵震中
    国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂（以下简称国棉二厂）根据河北纺织工业管理局的指示、河北日报的批评和全国国营纺织厂厂长会议关于开展反浪费斗争的决议，检查和批判了自营投资使用中的浪费。初步计算，浪费积压共达一百多万元。这个数字大略同国棉二厂三次追加自营投资计划的数字相等。这就是说，这个工厂一而再、再而三地向国家要求追加的钱，都被不必要地浪费掉了。
    去年四月，一份技术设计书送到了国棉二厂筹建处。筹建处的某些领导人员认为：国棉一厂建的早，比二厂小一半，尚且那么“阔气”，二厂能不如他们？天津的各国营棉纺织厂是接收的旧中国的官僚资本，也是那么讲究，新中国建立的大厂岂能
  “落后”？再说，“内部要不装璜得好些，怎能跟雄伟的建筑和近代化的机器设备配得上呢？”
    管理基本建设的筹建处为什么这样关心日后的内部装璜问题呢？因为筹建处就是将来厂子建成后的行政机构。他们总希望趁现在就用基本建设投资把东西买齐全些，将来使用就方便了。
    用什么法子向国家要钱呢？他们的“窍门”是很多的。其中一个重要的“窍门”是不按计划办事，违反专款专用原则。他们给它起了个动人的名称，叫做“内部平衡”。这样做的结果常常是：钱被“平衡”完了，却发现了某些必须花的钱没有了。于是再申请追加，“不批准就要影响工作”。这就是一而再、再而三地要求追加预算的理由。
    既然不甘落于人后，又有绝妙的“内部平衡”和“申请追加”的法宝，他们就大干起来。以后，在领导人员的支持、纵容、默许之下，这种“大干”的浪潮愈来愈汹涌，以致拨款指标、财务控制和上级布置的节约任务也拦阻不住了。
    看看他们是怎样地花这笔钱吧！
    看过“远离莫斯科的地方”这个电影的人们，一定还记得工程师办公室里的那个调度台——一个麦克风和一个喇叭。在调度台前，领导人员可以同百十里外的各工区直接通话，下达指示、听取汇报。筹建处主任张天性不顾自己的实际条件，坚持
  “也来那么一套”。刚好，纺织工业部也正打算在全国选择一个厂子做调度工作的示范，于是这个要求便被批准了。计划款数是二万五千元左右。他们派动力科的科长到上海去拣最好的进口货买了一部。买倒是买来了，可是因为不懂技术，这部调度台已在仓库里睡了几个月的觉。将来从上海请人来安装，总共至少要花四万元以上。而天津有一个厂近日安装的国产调度台才一万多元。
    国棉二厂的另一件“杰作”是一辆大交通车。车是由旧卡车在天津改装的。按照原来的设备装璜已是够漂亮够讲究的了。但是负责改装的总务科人员仍嫌它不够出众，没经主任批准就擅自在车上安装了一部收音机，一套扩大器。这样，“既可做交通车，又可做宣传车”，开出去自然威风凛凛。不过，这件“杰作”，连买旧车带改装费竟达四万二千元，差不多相当于三辆全新的苏联卡车的价格。
    这个工厂的办公室的陈设也是够讲究的。还在建厂工程紧张进行的时候，张天性就指示总务科：“把会议室、会客室弄得好一些。”为了这个“好一些”，总务科的人员着实费了一番心血。筹建处自己的营缮部做一套沙发一百六十元就够了，但只能做绒的，不如皮沙发“像样子”；本来化学地板已经够舒适的了，可是再铺上地毯岂不更妙？于是总务科长亲赴天津花了两千一百元买了五套皮沙发，一套绒沙发；花了三百九十元买了四块地毯。会客室和会议室像样子了，办公室相形之下又太寒伧了。“大家都舒服一些吧！”于是又花了一千五百多元做了五十二个小绒沙发，又花三百多元买了些“普通的”花草摆在各科室里。
    为了追求漂亮讲究，许多仪器如电流表、力率表、螺丝搬子等，本来国内有这些产品，完全可以用，但动力科长仍然买了许多国外产品。甚至理发室里的推头推子、刮脸刀子也要进口货。公共事业科科长甚至嫌国产的大理发镜子“照不出本色来”，不惜多花五、六倍的价钱去买外国镜子。
    为职工宿舍所做的小木凳子，目前全体职工一人分三个还多，即使两年以后职工全部满员，一人一个还分不完。全厂一共二十多个科室，但仅仅为科长级工作人员特别制做的绒圈椅就有一百六十多个。
    这样的事说起来也许令人难以相信，可是主持这件事的两位总务科长是有自己的打算的：“数量多些，将来使用方便，实在不行还可以卖给将来的三厂、四厂。反正将来卖东西比再向上级要钱买东西容易的多。”
    这个工厂的医疗设备也很多，X光机、超短波电疗机、太阳灯、万能产床、电冰箱，甚至牙科、眼科、耳鼻喉科和外科医疗器械等等，一共花了三万四千元。在买这些医疗设备之前，虽然大家都知道一厂和二厂不久将有一个统一的医院，工厂本身完全不需要这么多的医疗设备，但卫生科科长仍然宣称：“我们要使厂里的一切病人不出门就能解决问题！”这个庞大的购置计划得到了主任们的支持。价格占全部卫生设备一半的X光机就是副主任霍向新亲自批准的。最近，河北纺织管理局在检查中指出他们买的太多太全了，钱数超出了中央规定。卫生科于科长还很不满意。
    既然别的方面都那么讲究、齐全，“为生产服务”的实验室的装备就更要讲究、齐全了。竟有这样的事：当纺织工业部要国棉二厂做国外订货计划，以便由部里统一订购的时候，厂里布场的一个负责同志听说国外新制一种“闪光测速计”，价值
  一千五百多元，他就说：“买一个，咱们看看那是个嘛玩艺儿！”于是就申请订货。据河北纺织管理局初步检查，纱、布场实验室大约有两万元左右的仪器是可有可无的。局里提出应当削减某些仪器，纱、布场的某些领导人员却认为：这不是检查，是局里的人想给自己增加实验仪器来找二厂的便宜的，因而大表不满。
    国棉二厂是个刚刚建立起来的新摊子，困难很多。要做好工作自然要努力克服困难。但某些大方的领导人认为只要多花钱就可以“克服困难”。
    国棉二厂原有三个临时食堂：宿舍一个，厂里一个，厂子和宿舍当中还有一个。本来按照食堂面积和就膳人数三个食堂已经够用了，但因为管理不善，常常发生有些食堂过于拥挤的现象，人们很有意见。有人要总务科拿钱盖新食堂。总务科的人觉得无法开支，不同意盖。官司打到主任张天性那里。张主任不问青红皂白，大笔一挥批曰：“准予开支，具体项目完工后再作决定。”今年二月，造价七千多元的一座临时食堂盖起来了。但因为别的食堂仍然管理不善，拥挤现象仍然没有消除。而新食堂也因伙食办得不好，卖了两个早晨的饭就闲起来了。
    为了挽回这些严重的损失，肃清资产阶级思想给予建厂工作的影响，国棉二厂接受各方面的批评，连续召开党委会议、科长干部会议和全体职工大会，检查铺张浪费现象。张天性和其他负责工作人员都作了检讨，并采取了一些具体措施，削减了六项非生产性建设项目，减少了纱、布场价值数十万元的机物料储备量，节省了绿化费用，多余的沙发、地毯、卡车、床、凳子等都送到仓库里存起来，准备卖给别的需用单位或交上级调拨，据初步计算可以挽回损失一百四十万元。
