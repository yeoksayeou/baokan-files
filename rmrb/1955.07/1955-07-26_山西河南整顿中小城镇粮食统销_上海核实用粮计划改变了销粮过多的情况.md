Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 23rd: Shanxi Province has launched a rectification of the unified grain sales in more than 90 small and medium-sized towns. Over 6,000 collective mess units in government agencies, organizations, and schools in various towns have implemented strict grain supply budgeting and final accounting systems. The Taiyuan City Grain Bureau audited the grain consumption budgets of 349 units in July, and the average grain needed per person per month was reduced by five jin compared to June. In order to supervise and check grain waste at any time, some collective mess units in Yuci and Datong have also established inspection groups and correspondents.

Residents in the aforementioned towns have begun to subscribe to grain consumption plans. More than 3,000 staff members have been dispatched by Taiyuan City to residential areas to conduct publicity and assist in verifying the population. Propagandists distributed in various towns and urban areas have taken doing a good job in grain conservation publicity as the current political task, requiring that publicity on grain conservation reach every household.

The average amount of grain sold in various cities in May decreased by 15% compared to April, and in June it decreased by 23.8% compared to May. In Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xinxiang, the grain supply in the second quarter decreased by more than 9.6 million jin compared to the original supply target. Recently, the Henan Provincial People's Committee held another meeting to study the unified grain sales work in these 13 cities and four larger market towns in the province.

The rectification of unified grain sales in small and medium-sized cities in Henan Province began between April and May. Various cities carried out education on grain conservation for residents and staff of government agencies and organizations, gradually promoted the method of fixed quantity per household and planned supply at designated points in the citizens, and at the same time established and improved the strict audit system for grain consumption budgets and final accounts of collective mess units such as government agencies, organizations, and schools. At the same time, various localities have strengthened the management of the cooked food industry and other grain-using industries, reducing or preventing the phenomenon of repeated supply in the unified grain sales work.

    山西河南整顿中小城镇粮食统销
    上海核实用粮计划改变了销粮过多的情况
    新华社太原二十三日电　山西省九十多个中、小城镇的粮食统销整顿工作已经展开。各城镇的机关、团体、学校六千多个集体伙食单位，都实行了严格的粮食供应预决算制度。太原市粮食局七月份审核的三百四十九个单位的用粮预算，平均每人每月需要的粮食都比六月份减少五斤。为了随时监督和检查粮食浪费，榆次、大同等地的一些集体伙食单位还建立了检查组和通讯员。
    上述城镇的居民们已经开始订用粮计划。太原市派往居民区进行宣传和帮助核实人口的工作人员有三千多人。分布在各城镇和市区内的宣传员，已经把做好粮食节约宣传工作作为当前的政治任务，要求粮食节约的宣传做到家喻户晓。
    据新华社郑州二十二日电　河南省郑州、洛阳、开封等十三个中小城市在整顿粮食统销中，浪费粮食和虚报冒领现象大大减少。五月份各市粮食销售数量平均比四月份减少了百分之十五，六月份又比五月份减少百分之二十三点八。郑州、洛阳、新乡三市，第二季度粮食供应数量比原订供应指标减少九百六十多万斤。最近，河南省人民委员会又开会研究了这十三个城市和省内四个较大集镇的粮食统销工作。
    河南省各中小城市整顿粮食统销工作是在四、五月间开始的。各市对居民和机关、团体的工作人员进行了节约粮食的教育，在市民中逐步推行以户定量和划片定点计划供应的办法，同时建立和健全了机关、团体、学校等集体伙食单位的用粮预算和决算的严格审核制度。同时，各地还加强了对熟食业及其他用粮行业的管理，减少或制止了粮食统销工作中的重复供应现象。
    据新华社上海二十二日电　上海全市居民开展的反对浪费、厉行节约、认真核实用粮计划的工作已经在七月中旬基本结束。核实后的全市居民的用粮，比核实前降低了百分之十五左右。以往粮食销售过多的不合理情况已有改变。
    在核实用粮的工作中，上海市粮食部门事先作了比较深入的调查研究，了解了居民以往粮食消费的实际水平，指导居民把用粮计划核实得比较准确。全市里弄居民小组长以上干部二十多万人首先核实了自家的计划，然后以自己的经验，教育和帮助群众核实计划。共产党员、各级人民代表大会代表和工会会员、青年团员等有组织的成员，都以身作则，带头认真核实用粮计划，作出了榜样。在动员居民核实计划时，还组织群众交流了各种节约粮食的经验。
