　　Beijing Two Distillery Merger Saves Construction Funds
　　The state-owned Beijing Winery project, which began construction this year, has been merged with the Beijing Distillery recently based on the spirit of fully utilizing existing equipment. This has reduced many non-productive construction projects of the two factories, saving the state more than 480,000 yuan in investment.
　　The site of the Beijing Winery is adjacent to the original Beijing Distillery, and both factories are under the leadership of the Sugar and Wine Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry. When designing this winery, the relevant leaders did not adequately consider the coordination of production and equipment with the Beijing Distillery, resulting in many unreasonable aspects in the design of the factory buildings and welfare facilities. For example, the Beijing Distillery built a new office building in 1951, and only half of it is used for office work, with the other half used as a collective dormitory. However, the construction plan of the winery required an additional investment of more than 157,000 yuan to build another office building. The Beijing Distillery's koji-making workshop is close to the winery's production workshop. The bacteria in the koji-making workshop will inevitably affect the quality and hygiene of the wine in the future, but this was not fully considered in the design and appropriate adjustments were not made.
　　In April, the leadership of the Ministry of Light Industry re-examined the construction plan of the Beijing Winery, pointed out the above-mentioned unreasonable aspects, and requested modifications. It was also decided that after the winery was completed, it would be merged with the Beijing Distillery into one enterprise. After repeated studies by relevant units, it has recently been preliminarily decided to: move the koji-making workshop of the Beijing Distillery to the original Lu wine workshop of this factory, and incorporate the equipment of the Lu wine workshop into the production workshop of the winery; the building of the koji-making workshop will be converted into a family dormitory, and the office buildings of the new factory preparation office of the winery will also be converted into dormitories in the future. After the merger of the two factories in this way, the number of staff will not increase much, and the existing office building can still be used for half office work and half collective dormitory. The planned new office building of the winery and the two dormitories originally planned to be built by the two factories can be stopped. Other welfare facilities will also use the existing houses and equipment of the distillery, and no new ones will be built. In this way, in addition to increasing some investment in repairing old houses, a large amount of investment can be saved for the country, and a set of administrative management agencies can be reduced in the future, saving a large number of management personnel and management costs.

　　北京两酒厂合并节约建设资金
    今年动工兴建的国营北京葡萄酒厂工程，由于有关方面最近根据充分利用现有设备的精神，同北京酿酒厂合并，削减了两厂许多非生产性的建设项目，为国家节约投资四十八万多元。
    北京葡萄酒厂的厂址同原有的北京酿酒厂毗邻，两厂都属轻工业部糖酒工业管理局领导。在设计这个葡萄酒厂的时候，由于有关领导方面没有很好地考虑同北京酿酒厂的生产和设备相配合，在厂房和福利设施的设计中有许多不合理的地方。如北京酿酒厂在一九五一年新建办公大楼一座，现在办公只用一半，另一半作集体宿舍，而葡萄酒厂的建设计划中又要投资十五万七千多元另建一座办公楼；北京酿酒厂的制曲车间紧靠葡萄酒厂的生产车间，制曲车间的菌种将来必然影响葡萄酒的质量和卫生，设计时也没有全面考虑，作适当的调整。
    四月份，轻工业部领导方面重新审查了北京葡萄酒厂的建设计划，指出上述不合理的地方，要求加以修改，并决定葡萄酒厂建成以后同北京酿酒厂合并为一个企业。经过有关单位的多次研究，最近已经初步决定：把北京酿酒厂的制曲车间搬到这个厂原来的露酒车间，把露酒车间的设备并入葡萄酒厂的生产车间；制曲车间的房子改为家属宿舍，葡萄酒厂的新厂筹备处等办公房子，将来也改作宿舍。两厂这样合并以后，工作人员增加不多，现有办公楼仍旧可以一半办公，一半做集体宿舍。葡萄酒厂计划新建的办公大楼和这两个厂原来计划新建的两幢宿舍等项目都可以停建。其他福利设施也都利用酿酒厂现有的房屋、设备，不再另建。这样，除去增加一些修理旧房屋的投资以外，可为国家节约大量投资，将来还可以减少一套行政管理机构，节约大量的管理人员和管理费用。　（张之钝）
