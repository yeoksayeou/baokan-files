　　The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle for independence and peace have written the most glorious page in the history of the colonial people's liberation movement. The great victory of the Vietnamese people is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party. In leading the Vietnamese people in a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party, based on the objective and subjective conditions of Vietnam in various periods, timely put forward programs, policies, and slogans of struggle that reflected the demands of the broad masses of the Vietnamese people, and organized and led the Vietnamese people to struggle for the realization of these programs, policies, and slogans, enabling the Vietnamese revolution to move from one victory to another. The historical facts of the Vietnamese revolution for more than 20 years have proved that the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, are the most faithful representatives of the interests of the Vietnamese working class, working people, and the Vietnamese nation. Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the founder, organizer, and leader of the Party, is the great revolutionary teacher of the Vietnamese people. The Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh have received the heartfelt love and support of people from all walks of life across the country.
　　On the day of its founding in 1930, the Indochinese Communist Party put forward the famous January Program for striving to achieve a national democratic revolution in Vietnam. This program clearly stipulated the noble tasks of the Indochinese Communist Party: to lead the working class, peasants, and other working people, unite all patriotic elements, resolutely oppose imperialism and feudalism, achieve peace, unification, independence, and democracy, complete the national democratic revolution, and prepare conditions for the establishment of a beautiful socialist society.
　　In the early days of its birth, the Party led the famous Nghe-Tinh Uprising and established the first people's regime in Vietnamese history. After the failure of this people's regime, the revolution entered a low ebb. During the difficult period of 1931-1935, the Party persisted in underground activities under the brutal persecution of the enemy and continued to carry out anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. During the period of the French Popular Front in 1936-1939, the Party put forward the slogan of "opposing fascism and opposing war," organized and led the Indochinese Democratic United Front, united people from all walks of life around the Party, and promoted the rapid development of the revolutionary situation.
　　In 1940, Japanese fascists invaded Vietnam, and the French colonial authorities surrendered. The Indochinese Communist Party immediately called on people from all walks of life across the country to unite, establish an anti-imperialist national united front, and organize armed struggles. The Party led the Vietnamese people in launching the famous Bac Son, Do Luong, and Nam Ky uprisings, launching mass guerrilla warfare. Base areas were established, and at the same time, a united front including all strata of Vietnamese society—the Vietnam Independence League—was formed. In the five years of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, the Party led the Vietnamese people in severely打击 (dǎjī, strike) Japanese fascists, protecting the interests of the Vietnamese people, supporting the Allied forces in their operations, and preparing conditions for the subsequent August Revolution.
　　On August 15, 1945, the heroic Soviet Red Army defeated the elite Kwantung Army of the Japanese army, forcing Japanese fascists to surrender unconditionally. The Indochinese Communist Party immediately led the Vietnamese people in launching a general uprising on August 19, overthrowing the rule of Japanese fascists and establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the founder and organizer of the Indochinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups, was unanimously elected by the people of the country as the Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared the bankruptcy of the imperialists' colonial policy in Vietnam, and the national independence dreamed of by the Vietnamese people for many generations was realized.
　　However, the imperialists were unwilling to see the Vietnamese people gain independence and freedom, and they attempted to strangle the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its cradle as soon as it was born. Less than a month after the end of World War II, French colonialists began to launch armed aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Indochinese Communist Party immediately led the people of the whole country in an heroic war of liberation to defend the independence of the motherland and defend peace. The Party foresaw the long-term and arduous nature of this war, formulated a strategic policy of long-term, arduous, and self-reliance, and called on the people to overcome all difficulties, regardless of men, women, old, or young, to mobilize and fight against the aggressors in order to defend national independence. As a result, a broad-scale guerrilla warfare developed, which frustrated the enemy's conspiracy of "quick victory."
　　In March 1951, in order to meet the needs of the new situation in the war, the Party held its Second National Congress and decided to change the organization of the Indochinese Communist Party in Vietnam to the Vietnam Workers' Party. The Congress formulated a new party program and constitution and issued a declaration. The Vietnam Workers' Party inherited all the fine traditions of the Indochinese Communist Party and Vietnamese national history, and adopted important measures to consolidate the Party, such as rectifying the Party's ideology and rectifying the Party's organization, which greatly improved the Party's combat effectiveness and pushed forward the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and peace victoriously. Now, the Vietnam Workers' Party has become a party with more than 600,000 members that is closely linked to the broad masses.
　　During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, paid great attention to consolidating and expanding the united front based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Party closely united all patriotic forces around itself. In July 1949, the Party formulated the Rent Reduction Decree. In April 1953, the Party formulated the "Land Reform Program" to eliminate feudal land ownership. As a result of the implementation of this program, the anti-Japanese and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants was greatly enhanced, and the national democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance was unprecedentedly consolidated and expanded.
　　During the armed struggle against the French and puppet forces, the Party used its greatest strength to guide the war and build the Vietnam People's Army. The Party sent its best members to participate in military work and political work in the army, building the Vietnam People's Army into a powerful revolutionary army. Since the winter of 1950, the Vietnam People's Army has successively achieved major victories in the Border, Mid-Region, Hoa Binh, and Northwest campaigns, wiping out a large number of enemy effectives. In particular, the brilliant victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign in the spring of 1954 played a great role in promoting the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina.
　　After the restoration of peace, the Vietnam Workers' Party timely put forward new situations and new tasks in the peaceful period, resolutely leading the Vietnamese people to implement the armistice agreement, complete land reform, restore and improve production, and strengthen the construction of the People's Army, so as to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy. The Party has achieved many major achievements in realizing these new tasks. In particular, the Party led the broad masses of people in smashing the obstruction and sabotage of the United States, completing the withdrawal and transfer of troops, liberating all of North Vietnam. It also took over the vast areas of the Red River Delta and major cities such as Hanoi and Haiphong, restoring production and order in these areas, and began construction, demonstrating excellent results. The Vietnamese people are now moving forward with full confidence in the direction pointed out by the Vietnam Workers' Party.
　　For nearly a century, the Vietnamese people have waged unyielding struggles against imperialist aggression and to overthrow the brutal colonial rule and seek their own national independence and freedom. The famous anti-French struggles of Hoang Hoa Tham and Phan Dinh Phung lasted for more than ten years, demonstrating a heroic spirit of struggle worthy of praise and tears. However, these struggles all suffered failures because they lacked the leadership of advanced classes and parties. Only after the emergence of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party, in 1930, did the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom and independence undergo great changes. The history of the Vietnamese people's national liberation movement shows that the leading role of the working class and the parties of the working people armed with Marxism-Leninism is an indispensable condition for striving for national freedom and independence.
　　History proves that the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Indochinese Communist Party are the most faithful friends and representatives of the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups. They have always stood at the forefront of the struggle to strive for Vietnamese national independence and safeguard the rights of the Vietnamese people, and can overcome any hardships and difficulties to achieve victory. At present, the Vietnamese people are again facing a serious struggle against the US imperialists and their puppets who are undermining the Geneva Accords and attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time, but with the leadership of the Workers' Party, their struggle for the unification, independence, democratic peace of the motherland will surely be victorious.

　　越南劳动党——越南人民胜利斗争的组织者和鼓舞者
　　杜波
    越南人民在争取独立与和平的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，在殖民地人民解放运动史上写下了最光荣的一页。越南人民的伟大胜利，是和越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党的正确领导分不开的。印度支那共产党和越南劳动党在领导越南人民进行长期的艰苦的革命斗争中，根据越南的各个时期的主客观情况，及时地提出反映广大越南人民要求的斗争纲领、方针、口号，并组织和领导着越南人民为实现这些斗争纲领、方针、口号而斗争，使越南革命从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。二十多年的越南革命史实，证明了越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党是越南工人阶级、劳动人民和越南民族利益的最忠实的代表者。党的创始人、组织者和领导者——胡志明同志是越南人民的伟大的革命导师。党和胡志明同志得到了全国各阶层人民衷心的爱戴和支持。
    一九三零年印度支那共产党成立的那一天，它就提出了在越南争取实现民族民主革命的著名的一月政纲。这个政纲明确地规定印度支那共产党的崇高任务：领导工人阶级、农民和其他劳动人民，团结一切爱国分子，坚决反对帝国主义，反对封建主义，实现和平、统一、独立和民主，完成民族民主革命，为建立美好的社会主义社会准备条件。
    党在诞生的初期，就领导了著名的宜安起义，建立了越南历史上第一个人民政权。这个人民政权失败后，革命转入低潮，在一九三一—一九三五年的艰苦时期，党在敌人残酷的迫害下，坚持地下活动，继续进行反帝反封建斗争。在一九三六—一九三九年法国人民阵线时期，党提出“反对法西斯反对战争”的口号，组织和领导了印度支那民主统一战线，把各阶层人民团结到党的周围，推动了革命形势的迅速发展。
    一九四○年，日本法西斯侵入越南，法国殖民当局屈膝投降。印度支那共产党立即号召全国各阶层人民团结起来，建立反帝民族统一战线，组织武装斗争。党领导越南人民发动了著名的北山、都梁、南圻起义，展开群众性的游击战争。建立根据地，同时又组成了包括越南各阶层的统一战线——越南独立同盟。党领导越南人民在五年的抗日游击战争中，沉重地打击了日本法西斯，保护了越南人民的利益，支援了同盟国作战，并为后来的八月革命准备条件。
    一九四五年八月十五日，英勇的苏联红军击溃了日本军队的精锐关东军，迫使日本法西斯无条件投降。印度支那共产党立即领导越南人民在八月十九日举行总起义，推翻了日本法西斯的统治，建立了越南民主共和国。印度支那共产党的创始者和组织者、越南各族人民所爱戴的领袖胡志明同志，被全国人民一致选举为越南民主共和国主席。越南民主共和国的成立，宣告帝国主义者在越南的殖民政策的破产，越南人民多少世代来梦寐以求的民族独立得到了实现。
    但是，帝国主义不愿意看到越南人民获得独立和自由，它们企图在越南民主共和国刚刚诞生时就把它绞死在摇篮里。第二次世界大战结束还不到一个月，法国殖民者便开始向越南民主共和国发动武装侵略。印度支那共产党立即领导全国人民为保卫祖国独立、保卫和平而进行英勇的解放战争。党预见到这个战争的长期性和艰苦性，制定出长期、艰苦、自力更生的战略方针，号召人民为了保卫民族独立，克服一切困难，不分男女老少，全体动员起来同侵略者作战。于是一个规模广阔的游击战争发展起来，这就挫败了敌人“速战速决”的阴谋。
    一九五一年三月，为了适应战争新的形势的需要，党召开第二次全国代表大会，决定把印度支那共产党在越南的组织改为越南劳动党。大会制定新的党纲、党章，并发表宣言。越南劳动党继承着印度支那共产党和越南民族历史上一切优良的传统，并采取整顿党内思想、整顿党的组织等重要的巩固党的措施，这就大大地提高了党的战斗力，把越南人民争取独立与和平的斗争胜利地向前推进。现在，越南劳动党已成为拥有六十余万党员的密切联系广大群众的党。
    在八年抗战中，越南劳动党和它的前身印度支那共产党，十分注意巩固和扩大以工农联盟为基础的统一战线工作。党把一切爱国力量紧紧地团结在自己的周围。一九四九年七月，党制定了减租法令，一九五三年四月，党又制定了消灭封建土地所有制的“土地改革纲领”。这个纲领实施的结果，广大农民的抗战积极性和生产积极性大大地提高了，以工农联盟为基础的民族民主统一战线空前巩固和扩大了。
    在同法伪进行武装斗争期间，党用最大的力量来指导战争和建设越南人民军，党派出最优秀的党员参加军事工作和军队中的政治工作，把越南人民军建设成一支强大的革命军队。自一九五零年冬季开始，越南人民军接连取得了边界、中游、和平、西北等战役的重大胜利，歼灭了敌人大量有生力量。特别是一九五四年春的奠边府战役的辉煌胜利，对于促使日内瓦会议达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议起了很大的作用。
    和平恢复后，越南劳动党适时地提出了在和平时期的新形势和新任务，坚决领导着越南人民为实施停战协定，完成土地改革，恢复和提高生产，加强建设人民军，以巩固和平，实现统一，完成全国独立和民主而斗争。党在实现这些新的任务中，已经取得了许多重大的成就。特别是党领导广大人民击破了美国的阻挠和破坏，完成了军队的撤退转移工作，使北越全部解放。又接管了红河三角洲广大地区和河内、海防等大城市，恢复了这些地区的生产和秩序，并开始进行建设，表现了优异的成绩。越南人民现在正满怀信心，朝着越南劳动党所指引的方向迈进。
    近百年来，越南人民为了反对帝国主义的侵略，为了推翻残暴的殖民地统治，求得自己民族的独立和自由，曾经进行了不屈不挠的斗争。历史上有名的黄花探和潘庭逢的反法斗争，都坚持了十多年之久，表现了可歌可泣的英勇斗争精神。但是，这些斗争都因为没有先进阶级和政党的领导，遭受了失败。只有在一九三零年越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党一经出现，越南人民争取自由和独立的斗争形势就大为改观。越南人民争取民族解放运动的历史表明，以马克思列宁主义武装起来的工人阶级和劳动人民的政党的领导作用，是争取民族自由和独立的不可缺少的条件。
    历史证明，越南劳动党和印度支那共产党是越南各族人民最忠实的朋友和代表，它在争取越南民族独立，维护越南人民权利的斗争中，始终站在斗争的最前线，并能够克服任何艰险和困难而达到胜利。目前越南人民又面临着同美帝国主义者及其傀儡破坏日内瓦协定，企图长期分割越南的严重斗争，但是越南人民有了劳动党的领导，他们为祖国的统一、独立、民主和平的斗争就定会获得胜利。
