Following the National Oil Production Conference in early November 1954, which proposed an oil increase movement centered on promoting advanced oil extraction experience to improve oil yield, with the goal of increasing edible oil production by 100,000 tons, the oil increase movement has gradually unfolded across the country over the past six months. Many oil factories have studied and promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method, and some regions have also launched inter-factory labor competitions. In these units, the oil yield has gradually increased. The cottonseed oil yield of Yuncheng Oil Factory in Shanxi Province increased from 14 percent to 17.5 percent, the peanut oil yield of Dawenkou Oil Factory in Shandong Province increased from 39.25 percent to 42.97 percent, the rapeseed oil yield of Meitan Oil Factory in Guizhou Province increased from 33 percent to 39.2 percent, and after the Fuyang wooden oil mill in Anhui Province promoted the advanced experience of soybean softening and heating, the oil yield increased from 12.5 percent to 15.6 percent, creating the highest soybean oil yield record in the province. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen provinces and cities in the first quarter, oil production increased by more than 11,400 tons, of which Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Jilin provinces all overfulfilled their quarterly production increase targets. The results in April and May were even better than in the first quarter, and it is expected that most provinces and cities will be able to complete the second quarter production increase plan.

However, at present, the oil increase movement in most regions is not in-depth, and the progress between regions, between different types of economies, and between different enterprises is very uneven. The main reason for this situation is that the leaders of some departments and enterprises do not fully understand the significant economic and political significance of increasing oil production by 100,000 tons, and therefore have not paid enough attention to the promotion of advanced experience. Some units are still in the pilot stage; some lack confidence in the development of the oil increase movement; and even those departments and enterprises that have already promoted advanced experience do not work deeply enough. There are also some regions that, on the one hand, have surplus capacity in mechanized oil extraction equipment, and on the other hand, blindly develop indigenous oil presses, attempting to use this method to meet the temporary and local supply of oil cake fertilizer. As a result, the management of indigenous oil presses is poor, the oil yield decreases, and a large amount of oilseeds is wasted. These problems must be resolved quickly.

As everyone knows, with the development of socialist industrialization and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for oils and fats is also increasing. An important way to increase oils and fats is to increase the production of oil crops, but the planting area of oil crops cannot be expanded extensively without considering the needs of food crops and other cash crops. At the same time, under the conditions where the small-scale peasant economy still occupies a dominant position, the yield per unit area can only be gradually increased. Therefore, another way to increase oil production is to vigorously tap the potential of industrial production, improve oil yield, and rationally utilize oilseeds. This is an extremely realistic and extremely important task. If we can complete the task of increasing oil production by 100,000 tons in this area this year, we can improve the supply of edible oil, create wealth of about 100 million yuan for the country, expand the accumulation of socialist construction funds, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Of course, it takes arduous efforts to complete the task of increasing oil production by 100,000 tons. The economic types of oil industrial enterprises are diverse, the management level is uneven, the distribution of oil extraction equipment and oilseed production areas is unbalanced, and indigenous oil extraction still accounts for about 70 percent. In particular, the existing quantity of raw materials is less than the original plan last year, and the oil content of raw materials in some areas has decreased due to floods last year. These are all difficulties in completing the production increase task. However, it must also be seen that the potential for increasing oil production in the oil industry is very large. So far, the difference between advanced and backward oil yields in various regions is still very large. Compared with Huaiyin and Yangzhou special districts in Jiangsu Province, the oil yield per hundred catties of soybeans is about half a catty to one catty different. The newly developed indigenous oil presses in Dezhou, Huimin, Liaocheng, and Heze special districts of Shandong Province have a peanut oil yield of only 26 percent (the oil yield of normal oil factories can reach at least 38 percent or more); the oil yield of first, second, and third-grade mixed cottonseeds is only about 6 percent (the oil yield of normal oil factories can reach at least 12 percent or more). Moreover, there is often a large gap between workshops and workshops, and between groups and groups in the same factory. As long as we make further efforts to improve on the existing operations and make the backward catch up with the advanced, we can increase a large amount of oil.

Actively opening up new oil sources is also an important way to increase oil production. At present, industrial by-products and wild oilseeds with relatively high oil content and considerable output have been discovered, and thirteen types of silkworm pupae, camphor tree seeds, Chinese toon seeds, cocklebur seeds, saltwort seeds, prickly ash seeds, candle nut seeds, and knotweed seeds have been successfully trial-extracted by various provinces and cities. As long as industrial and commercial departments at all levels cooperate closely, widely mobilize the masses to collect, and organize procurement and pressing in a timely manner, it is estimated that more than 30,000 tons of oil can be increased throughout the year.

It can be seen that increasing oil production by 100,000 tons is completely reliable, and there should be no doubt or concern. As long as we can proceed from the overall interests, quickly correct the shortcomings in our work, overcome all difficulties, and continue to complete the tasks in the second half of the year on the basis of the production increase in the first half of this year, the glorious task of increasing oil production by 100,000 tons will definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

In order to ensure the comprehensive development of the oil increase movement and continuously improve the existing level, it is first necessary to strengthen organizational leadership in the future. All regions should establish and improve oil increase committees under the provincial and municipal people's committees, establish office institutions, and unify the leadership of various economic types of production increase plans, arrange production, allocate oilseeds, promote advanced experience, and conduct regular inspections. In special districts or counties and cities with a large number of oil factories (workshops), advanced oil extraction experience promotion stations or committees should also be established, with certain personnel responsible for daily liaison work. As for some areas where the strength of the industrial system is relatively weak and there are more private and handicraft oil factories or workshops, the oil company or supply and marketing cooperative may be responsible for leadership under the overall arrangement of the oil increase committee. Oil increase institutions at all levels must verify the tasks in detail for their subordinate units, and implement the production increase targets specifically into each factory and workshop, and promptly inspect and promote them.

In the movement to increase oil production, special attention should be paid to strengthening the leadership and management of indigenous oil extraction, which accounts for a large proportion of oil production. Indigenous oil extraction is more common in central and southern, southwestern, and northwestern regions. These indigenous oil extractions have a considerable waste of oilseeds due to backward operation methods. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously organize technical assistance and promote advanced experience to improve its production technology level. Various regions can also appropriately adjust their equipment according to local conditions and adopt centralized merger methods to adapt to the needs of centralized procurement, allocation, supply of oilseeds, and improvement of operation methods. At the same time, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should also do a good job of exchanging oil for seeds, and educate and persuade the masses not to use simple tools to self-extract oilseeds, so as to avoid waste.

We should continue to actively promote Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method. Li Chuanjiang's advanced operation method is a relatively mature and systematic advanced experience at present. After it was promoted in Northeast China in early 1952, the soybean oil yield increased from about 10 percent to the current 13 percent or so, and some factories have reached about 15 percent. This experience has been continuously enriched and improved in various places over the years. Its basic principles are not only applicable to pressing soybeans, but also applicable to pressing oilseeds such as peanuts, cottonseeds, rapeseed, and sesame; it is not only applicable to indigenous oil workshops and semi-mechanized oil factories, but also applicable to new-style mechanized oil factories. As long as we can learn from this experience and formulate specific operation methods under different conditions such as different equipment and different oilseeds in a focused manner and implement them, then the oil yield can definitely be improved.

For other new advanced experiences, we must also actively, cautiously, and repeatedly conduct experiments, and promote them after appraisal. For example, the "single-circle thin cake" pressing method is a relatively mature experience at present, and each hundred catties of raw materials can produce an extra 0.3 to 0.5 catties of oil. In order to encourage the promotion of advanced experience and improve oil yield, we must do a good job in rewarding and comparing work to encourage the advanced and drive the backward. At the same time, the trade union should assist the administration to effectively improve the labor organization and production management system.

All regions should conscientiously implement the "Agreement on Processing Methods of Vegetable Oil Materials" and supplementary agreements jointly issued by the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. This agreement has a positive effect on encouraging processing factories to improve technology, rationally utilize oilseeds, and increase oil production. However, so far, some provinces and cities have not yet reached a processing agreement, or although an agreement has been reached at the provincial level, the subordinate special districts and counties have not conscientiously implemented it. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to quickly reverse the idea and practice of haggling over the partial interests of one's own department without regard to the overall national interests, and under the leadership of the local people's committee, sign specific agreements and processing contracts as soon as possible, and resolutely and conscientiously implement them.

Now is the season when rapeseed is on the market in large quantities, and other pre-autumn oilseeds will also gradually begin to be supplied. All regions should seize the opportunity to conscientiously do the above-mentioned work, so that the oil increase movement can be carried out comprehensively, deeply, and rapidly, and strive to complete or overfulfill the task of increasing oil production by 100,000 tons.

    努力完成十万吨油脂的增产任务
    一九五四年十一月初全国油脂生产会议提出以推广先进榨油经验提高产油率为中心内容的、以增产十万吨食油为奋斗目标的油脂增产运动之后，半年来，油脂增产运动已在全国各地逐步展开。许多油脂工厂都学习和推广了李川江先进榨油法，若干地区还开展了厂际劳动竞赛。在这些单位中，产油率都逐步有所提高。山西运城油厂棉籽产油率由百分之十四提高到百分之十七点五，山东大汶口油厂花生产油率由百分之三十九点二五提高到四十二点九七，贵州湄潭油厂菜籽榨油率由百分之三十三提高到三十九点二，安徽阜阳木榨油厂推行大豆软化加热的先进经验后，产油率由百分之十二点五提高到十五点六，创造了全省大豆产油率的最高纪录。据第一季度十八个省市不完全统计，油脂增产共达一万一千四百吨以上，其中江苏、安徽、河南、吉林四省都超额完成了季度增产任务。四、五月份各地的成绩，又比第一季度好，预计大部分省市能完成第二季度增产计划。
    但是，目前大部分地区的油脂增产运动还不深入，各地区间、各类型经济间、各企业间的进度还很不平衡。产生这种情况的主要原因在于某些部门和企业的领导人员对于增产十万吨油脂的重大经济意义和政治意义认识不足，因而对推广先进经验还没有引起足够的重视。有的单位目前还停留在试点阶段；有的对油脂增产运动的开展缺乏信心，即使已经推广先进经验的部门和企业，工作也不够深入。还有些地区，一方面机榨设备能力还有多余，一方面又盲目发展土榨油坊，企图用这种办法来满足一时一地的饼肥供应。结果，土榨油坊的管理工作不好，产油率反而下降，浪费了大量油料。这些问题是必须迅速解决的。
    大家都知道，随着社会主义工业化的发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，油脂的需要量也越来越多。增加油脂的一个重要途径，就是增产油料作物，但油料作物的种植面积又不可能不顾及粮食作物及其他经济作物的需要而大量扩展，同时，在小农经济还占优势的条件下，单位面积产量也只能逐步提高。因此，增产油脂的另一个途径，就只有大力挖掘工业生产潜力，提高产油率，合理地利用油料，这是一项极其现实的和极其重要的工作。如果今年能在这方面完成增产十万吨油脂的任务，就可以改进食油的供应情况，为国家创造一亿元左右的财富，扩大社会主义建设资金的积累，并进一步巩固工农联盟。
    当然，要完成增产十万吨油脂的任务是需要艰苦努力的。油脂工业企业的经济类型多，管理水平不一，榨油设备的分布和油料产区不平衡，土榨比重还占百分之七十左右，特别是现有原料数量比去年原计划又减少了一部分，部分地区因去年受水灾以致原料含油率降低，这些都是完成增产任务的困难。但是，也必需看到，油脂工业的增产潜力是很大的，到目前为止，各地区之间先进和落后的产油率还相差很远。以江苏淮阴专区和扬州专区相比，每百斤大豆的产油率约差半斤至一斤。山东德州、惠民、聊城、菏泽等专区新发展的土榨油坊，花生出油率只百分之二十六（正常油厂的出油率至少可达百分之三十八以上）；一、二、三等混合棉籽的出油率仅百分之六左右（正常油厂的出油率至少可达百分之十二以上）。而且同一工厂的车间和车间之间、组和组之间，往往也有很大距离。只要经过进一步的努力，在现有操作的基础上提高一步，使落后的赶上先进的，就能够增产大量油脂。
    积极开辟新油源也是增产油脂的一个重要方法。目前已发现的含油量较多、并有相当产量的工业副产品及野生油料，并经各省市试榨成功的有蚕蛹、樟树籽、椿树籽、苍耳籽、盐蒿籽、花椒籽、石栗籽、木蓼籽等十三种。只要各级工商部门密切配合，广泛发动群众采集，及时组织收购、压榨，全年估计能增产油脂三万多吨。
    由此可见，增产十万吨油脂是完全有可靠根据的，不应该有丝毫怀疑和顾虑。只要我们能从整体利益出发，迅速纠正工作中的缺点，克服一切困难，在今年上半年增产的基础上，继续完成后半年的任务，增产十万吨油脂的光荣任务是一定能够完成和超额完成的。
    为了保证油脂增产运动的全面展开，并不断提高现有水平，今后首先必须加强组织领导。各地都应在省市人民委员会下建立并健全油脂增产委员会，设立办公机构，统一领导各种经济类型的增产计划、安排生产、调拨油料、推广先进经验和经常进行检查。在油厂（坊）较大、较多的专区或县、市，也应该建立榨油先进经验推广站或委员会，设置一定的人员负责日常联系工作。至于某些工业系统的力量比较薄弱、私营和手工业油厂或油坊较多的地区，则可由油脂公司或供销合作社为主、在油脂增产委员会统筹安排下负责领导。各级油脂增产机构对所属各单位必须详细核实任务，把增产指标具体贯彻到每个厂坊中去，及时加以检查和推动。
    在增产油脂的运动中，对于在油脂生产中占有很大比重的土榨要特别注意加强领导和管理。在中南、西南、西北等地区，土榨都较为普遍。这些土榨因为操作方法落后，油料的浪费现象相当严重。因此，必须大力组织技术协助，推广先进经验，以提高其生产技术水平。各地区还可根据当地具体情况，适当调整其设备，采取集中合并的方式，以适应油料集中收购调拨供应和改进操作法的需要。同时，基层供销合作社还应做好以油换籽的工作，并教育说服群众不要用简单的工具自榨油料，以免浪费。
    我们应该继续积极地推广李川江先进榨油法。李川江先进操作法是目前较为成熟的、系统的先进经验，一九五二年初在东北地区推行后，大豆产油率就从百分之十左右，提高至现在的十三左右，个别厂已达十五左右。这个经验，几年来在各地推广中又不断丰富和提高了。它的基本原理不但适用于压榨大豆，而且适用于压榨花生、棉籽、菜籽和芝麻等油料；不但适用于土榨油坊和半机榨油厂，并且适用于新式机榨油厂。只要我们能够学习这个经验，有重点地制定出在不同设备、不同油料等不同条件下的具体操作法，加以贯彻，那末，产油率是肯定可以提高的。
    对于其他新的先进经验，也必须积极地、慎重地反复进行试验，经过鉴定后，加以推广。如“单圈薄饼”压榨法是目前较为成熟的经验，每百斤原料可多出油零点三至零点五斤。为了鼓励推广先进经验、提高产油率，必须做好奖励、评比工作，以鼓励先进、带动落后。同时，工会应协助行政，有效地改善劳动组织和生产管理制度。
    各地要认真贯彻轻工业部、地方工业部、粮食部、商业部、全国供销合作总社联合颁发的“植物油料加工办法的协议”及补充协议。这个协议对于鼓励加工工厂改进技术、合理利用油料、增产油脂是有积极作用的。但到目前为止，还有一些省市仍未达成加工协议，或虽在省一级已达成协议，而所属的专、县则又未认真贯彻。因此，目前必须迅速扭转那种斤斤计较本部门局部利益而不顾整个国家利益的想法和做法，在当地人民委员会领导下，及早签订具体协议和加工合同，坚决、切实地贯彻执行。
    现在正当菜籽大量上市的季节，其他秋前油料，也将逐步开始供应，各地应抓紧时机，认真做好上述各项工作，使油脂增产运动全面地深入地迅速开展起来，为争取完成或超额完成增产十万吨油脂的任务而努力。
