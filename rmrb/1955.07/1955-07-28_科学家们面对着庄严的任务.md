Scientists Face a Solemn Task
By our reporters Bai Sheng and Jian Yuan

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country has written down the common aspirations of 600 million people to build a happy socialist life, and also the joy of those veteran scientists who have been looking forward to the industrialization of the country for many years.

The representatives from the scientific community attending the Second Session of the National People's Congress, whether at the congress, in group discussions, or at their residences, disregarded the sweltering summer heat and studied this great construction plan carefully, time and time again. The plan excited them and filled them with all sorts of emotions.

"Our ideals have been realized!" said bridge expert Mao Yisheng with deep feeling after reading the report on the Five-Year Plan.

Like many in the scientific community in the old society, Mao Yisheng had dreamed of saving the country through industry and building his country into a strong industrial power, but he also felt that this was a very remote possibility and that he would not see it in his lifetime. After returning from studying in the United States, he had dreamed of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. "But that was just like a dream! The Kuomintang reactionaries shouted for decades about building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, but in the end, not even a shadow of a bridge appeared. Today, the People's Republic of China has been established for only a few years, and the Chinese people have begun to build the massive Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge with their own hands. This long-term dream will soon become a reality."

Mao Yisheng said excitedly, "Today, I am fortunate to participate in the technical advisory work for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. This bridge is not only many times larger than the Qiantang River Bridge (Mao Yisheng was the designer of this bridge), but also technically complex. Especially because the river is wide, deep, and the current is rapid, there are many difficulties in construction. But today, we can overcome these difficulties. With the help of Soviet experts, we can do all the design and construction ourselves. Most of the steel and machinery used in the construction are also our own products. Although this project is only one of the many important construction projects in our Five-Year Plan, it is a groundbreaking event in the history of bridge engineering in our country."

Mao Yisheng is full of confidence in the realization of China's Five-Year Plan. He said, "Only the road of socialist industrialization can enable us old people to see the beautiful prospects of the motherland's construction. As a scientist and engineer, I am willing to contribute my share to the research work of railway bridge engineering and the training of young scientific and technical cadres."

Zhou Ren, an old scientist who was the first to do electric furnace smelting research in China and the director of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attended the National People's Congress despite his illness. He sees most clearly the backwardness of industry and the extreme underdevelopment of technical science in old China, and the great development of technical science in new China in just a few years. Today's Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics was founded by him personally in 1928. At that time, under the rule of the reactionaries, his research work received no attention or support. But today, Zhou Ren feels that his work is so closely linked to the industrial construction of the motherland. In recent years, he and the researchers of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics have personally participated in the construction of the motherland's new iron and steel industrial base, and have conducted a series of studies on mineral processing, smelting, etc., providing the necessary data for the establishment of relevant iron and steel centers.

This old scientist said excitedly, "The Five-Year Plan has put forward a solemn task for us scientific and technological workers. The pace of national construction is so fast that there is much work that needs to be done by us. I am old, but I feel very fortunate to be able to see the rapid progress of new China on the road to industrialization in my later years. I am willing to work hard in my own position to give full play to my share of strength."

The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total output value of agriculture and its sideline industries will increase by 23.3 percent in five years. Agricultural scientists bear a major responsibility in completing this plan. Agronomist Jin Shanbao said that now every agricultural scientist will deeply feel that "heroes have a place to use their talents." He recalled the frustration of agricultural scientific research being divorced from reality before liberation. When he wanted to go to the countryside, the reactionary government would do everything possible to obstruct him. In 1939, in Sichuan, he and a comrade went to the countryside to conduct a survey and research on local crops, but were subjected to unreasonable interrogation and restrictions. There were many similar incidents of agricultural scientists being persecuted by the reactionary government, so they had to stay in the "laboratory" and develop the habit of splitting hairs. It was simply a dream to want to research any valuable results. After liberation, thanks to the encouragement and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, agricultural scientists strictly criticized the reactionary theories of Weismann and Morgan, and learned advanced Soviet agricultural science, recognizing that Michurin's theory is the most advanced biological science in the world, full of militancy and creativity, and a science that is closely linked to theory and practice. Therefore, agricultural scientists continue to go deep into the countryside to learn from the vast number of working farmers the rich practical experience of agricultural production, summarize these experiences, and raise these experiences to the theoretical level to enrich science. Nanjing Agricultural College, with Jin Shanbao as its president, is now, under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, organizing ancient Chinese agricultural books, studying the experience accumulated by Chinese farmers in agricultural production and in fighting nature for thousands of years. Jin Shanbao said, "With the Five-Year Plan, the goal of struggle is clearer. Agricultural scientists should unite, learn better from agricultural labor models, and strengthen research work to complete the Five-Year Plan."

Since liberation, China's meteorological undertaking has made great progress, and the quality and quantity of high-altitude and ground meteorological stations and networks have improved. Now, from Hainan Island to Heilongjiang, from the coast of the East China Sea to Xinjiang, many meteorological stations have been established. On the edge of the desert, on high mountains or plateaus of four to five thousand meters above sea level, meteorological workers are everywhere performing their tasks. However, before liberation, meteorological undertaking and meteorological science, in addition to being ornaments of the reactionary government, mainly served as tools for imperialism to steal meteorological intelligence in our country. Meteorologist Tu Changwang said, "As a meteorological scientist, my only feeling at that time was depression, endless depression, because this undertaking had no future!" He continued, "Now I also have depression, but not because there is no future, we now have a very bright future; now I am depressed that meteorological work from quantity to quality can not keep up with the needs of the people." Facing the Five-Year Plan, meteorological work must ensure the needs of national defense, serve industrial and mining bases, serve transportation, serve agricultural production, and improve the accuracy of forecasts and extend the forecast period. By the time the Five-Year Plan is completed, the total number of meteorological stations will increase tenfold compared with before liberation, and the number of high-altitude meteorological stations will increase thirty to forty times. And these stations will be equipped according to the latest technical standards. Faced with the Five-Year Plan, every meteorological worker is excited. Therefore, Tu Changwang emphasized, "The implementation of the Five-Year Plan will further develop the meteorological undertaking and enable meteorological technology science to obtain new themes closely combined with the needs of the country in research, and conduct more in-depth research work."

The scientists' views on the Five-Year Plan are consistent. They said, "The Five-Year Plan itself is a scientific document." Faced with the Five-Year Plan, scientists all thought that their work was not done well enough. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "Since the founding of the country, the entire scientific research work has been continuously progressing, but it is still far from keeping up with the needs of the country. For example, even by the time the Five-Year Plan is completed, petroleum is still far from meeting the needs. The problem is that many geological structures are not clear, so the quantity and quality of drilling are not enough. Finding more petroleum resources and studying methods for developing artificial petroleum industry are one of the glorious tasks assigned to scientists by the Five-Year Plan. In addition, the country also requires scientific and technical personnel to conduct a series of research work: research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, research to support the construction of new iron and steel bases, research on earthquakes, investigation and research to support river basin planning and development, investigation and research on tropical plant resources in South China, research on China's natural regionalization and economic regionalization, etc." Zhu Kezhen continued, "With the Five-Year Plan, we can more clearly know the country's hopes for scientists, and every aspect of scientific research work has a direction and specific goals. The Five-Year Plan is a lighthouse. It makes us see that the future is difficult, but also bright. All scientific workers should wholeheartedly contribute their strength and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan." Zhu Kezhen's words expressed the common feelings of the scientists attending this meeting.

    科学家们面对着庄严的任务
    本报记者　柏生　鉴远
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，写下了六万万人民建设社会主义幸福生活的共同愿望，也写下了那些多少年来就盼望着国家工业化的老科学家们的满怀喜悦。
    出席全国人民代表大会第二次会议的科学界的代表们，无论是在大会上或小组讨论中，或是在代表住处，他们都不顾盛夏的酷热，一次又一次地仔细研读着这个伟大的建设计划。这计划使他们兴奋，也使他们感触万端。
    “我们的理想实现了！”桥梁专家茅以升读过关于五年计划的报告以后，深有所感地说。
    茅以升在旧社会里，和多少科学界人士一样，幻想过工业救国，幻想过把自己的国家建设成富强的工业国，但他自己也感觉到这是很渺茫的事，觉得自己这一生是看不到了。他从美国留学回国以后，曾经有过修建武汉长江大桥的想望。“但那究竟像做梦一般呵！国民党反动派空喊了几十年修建武汉长江大桥，最后连个桥影也不见。今天，中华人民共和国成立才不过几年，中国人民就用自己的双手开始修建规模巨大的武汉长江大桥了，这个过去长期的梦想很快就要变成现实了。”
    茅以升兴奋地说：“今天我庆幸自己能参加修建武汉长江大桥的技术顾问工作。这桥不仅规模比钱塘江大桥（茅以升是这大桥的设计者）要大许多倍，而且技术复杂。特别因为江面宽，水深流急，修建困难很多。但今天，这些困难我们都能克服。在苏联专家的帮助下，一切设计、施工，我们自己都能做。施工用的大部分钢材和机器，也都是我们自己的产品。这个工程虽然只是我们五年计划中许多重要建设工程中的一项，但它在我国桥梁工程史上是破天荒的一件大事。”
    茅以升对实现我国五年计划充满信心。他说：“只有社会主义工业化的道路，才能使我们这些老年人也能看到祖国建设的美好远景。作为一个科学家、工程师，我愿意在铁道桥梁工程的研究工作中和培养年青科学技术干部的工作中，贡献出我的一分力量。”
    最早在中国做电炉冶炼研究工作的老科学家、中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所的所长周仁，带病参加了全国人民代表大会。他对旧中国工业落后，技术科学极端不发达的情形，和新中国技术科学在短短几年中获得很大发展的情形，看得最清楚。今天的冶金陶瓷研究所就是他在一九二八年亲手创办起来的。那时候在反动派统治下，他的研究工作得不到任何重视和支持。但是今天，周仁感到自己的工作岗位和祖国的工业建设联系得那么密切，几年来，他和冶金陶瓷研究所的研究人员亲身参加了祖国新钢铁工业基地的建设工作，对选矿、冶炼等进行了一系列的研究，给有关钢铁中心的建立提供了所需要的数据。
    这位老科学家兴奋地说：“五年计划给我们科学技术工作者提出了庄严的任务，国家建设速度这么快，许多工作都需要我们去做。我年纪老了，但在我的晚年能够看到新中国在工业化道路上如此迅速地前进，我觉得很幸运。我愿意在我自己的工作岗位上努力发挥出我的一分力量来。”
    五年计划规定，农业及其副业的总产值在五年内增长百分之二十三点三。在完成这一计划中，农业科学工作者负有重大的责任。农学家金善宝说，现在每一个农业科学工作者都会深深感受到，“英雄有用武之地”了。他回想起解放以前农业科学研究工作脱离现实的苦闷。想到农村去，反动政府却要百般阻挠。一九三九年在四川时，他曾和一位同志到乡间去，准备对当地农作物作一番调查研究，但受到无理的盘查和限制。农业科学工作者受到反动政府类似这样的迫害事件是很多的，因此他们只好老呆在“研究室”，养成钻牛角尖的习惯。要想研究出什么有价值的成果，根本是梦想。解放以后，由于共产党和人民政府的鼓励和帮助，农业科学工作者严格地批判了魏斯曼、毛尔根主义者的反动学说，学习了先进的苏联农业科学，认识到米丘林学说是世界上最先进的生物科学，它充满着战斗性和创造性，是理论同实际密切联系的科学。所以农业科学工作者们不断深入到农村，向广大劳动农民学习丰富的实际的农业生产经验，总结了这些经验，把这些经验提高到理论上来丰富科学。以金善宝作院长的南京农学院，在农业部的领导下，现在正在整理我国古代农书，研究我国几千年来农民从事农业生产以及和自然进行斗争中积累起来的经验。金善宝说：“有了五年计划，奋斗的目标更明确了。农业科学工作者应该团结起来，更好地向农业劳动模范学习，同时加强研究工作，为完成五年计划而努力。”
    解放以来，我国气象事业有了很大进步，高空和地面气象台、站网的质和量都有进展。现在从海南岛到黑龙江，从东海滨到新疆，已经设立了很多气象台、站。在沙漠的边缘上，在拔海四、五千公尺的高山或高原上，到处有气象工作者在执行他们的任务。可是在解放以前，气象事业和气象科学，除了作为反动政府的点缀品以外，主要只作为帝国主义在我国窃取气象情报的工具。气象学家涂长望说：“作为一个气象科学工作者，我那时唯一的感受是苦闷，说不完的苦闷，因为这个事业没有前途！”他接着说：“现在我也有苦闷，不过不是因为没有前途，我们现在有非常远大的前途；现在我苦闷的是气象工作从量到质都赶不上人民的需要。”面对着五年计划，气象工作要保证国防的需要，要为工矿基地服务，要为交通运输服务，要为农业生产服务，并且要求提高预报准确率，延长预报期。到五年计划完成，气象台、站的总数将较解放前增加十倍，高空气象台、站将增加三十至四十倍。并且这些台、站将是按最新技术标准设备的。面对着五年计划，每一个气象工作人员都是兴奋的。因此涂长望强调说：“五年计划的实施，将使气象事业得到进一步的发展，将使气象技术科学在研究方面获得新的密切结合国家需要的题材，进行更深入的研究工作。”
    科学家们对五年计划的看法是一致的。他们说：“五年计划本身就是一个科学文献。”科学家们面对五年计划，大家都想到自己的工作做得不够。中国科学院副院长竺可桢说：“建国以来，整个科学研究工作是在不断进步，但还远远赶不上国家的需要。比如石油，即使到五年计划完成，同需要相比也还相差很远，问题就是许多地质结构还不清楚，以致钻探的量和质都不够。找寻更多的石油资源和研究发展人造石油工业的办法，这就是五年计划赋给科学家们的光荣任务之一。另外，国家还要求科学技术工作人员进行一系列的研究工作：原子能和平利用的研究，配合新钢铁基地的建设的研究，地震的研究，配合流域规划与开发的调查研究，华南热带植物资源的调查研究，中国自然区划和经济区划的研究，等等。”竺可桢接着说：“有了五年计划，可以更清楚地知道国家对科学家们的希望，科学研究工作的每一方面都有了方向和具体的目标，五年计划是一座灯塔。它使我们看到前途是艰巨的，但又是光明的。全体科学工作者应当全心全意贡献自己的力量，为完成五年计划而努力。”竺可桢的话，表达了出席这次会议的科学家们共同的心情。
