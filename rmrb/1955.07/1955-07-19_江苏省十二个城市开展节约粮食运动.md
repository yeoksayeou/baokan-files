    Twelve cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Xuzhou, are continuing to carry out a food saving campaign in their government offices, schools, and factories. Government offices, organizations, factories, and schools in various cities have all adopted food consumption budgeting and daily reporting systems to curb food waste. In Nanjing, after sixty units in the secondary school system implemented food budgeting and other systems, food waste in June decreased by more than 200,000 jin compared to May. The volume of food sales in Nanjing and Xuzhou in June decreased by about 13 percent compared to May.

    The actions of government offices, organizations, factories, and schools in saving food have had a good impact on residents, and many residents have voluntarily applied to reduce their food supply. In Nanjing's Second District alone, more than 580 households applied to the food supply department to reduce their grain supply by more than 5,600 jin.

    江苏省十二个城市开展节约粮食运动
    江苏省南京、常州、无锡和徐州等十二个城市中的机关、学校和工厂继续开展节约粮食运动。各市机关、团体、工厂和学校等单位都用粮食消费的预决算和日报制度，来限制了用粮的浪费。南京市中等学校系统六十个单位实行粮食预决算等制度后，六月份粮食浪费量比五月份减少二十多万斤。南京和徐州两市六月份粮食销售量比五月份减少了百分之十三左右。
    机关、团体、工厂和学校节约粮食的行动在居民中发生了良好影响，很多居民自动申请减少粮食供应量。仅南京市二区就有五百八十多户居民向粮食供应部门申请减少供应粮五千六百多斤。
