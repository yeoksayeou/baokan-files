    Strive to Fully Realize the First Five-Year Plan
    Launch Labor Emulation Drive to Greet the First Five-Year Plan with New Production Achievements
    Editor:
    The entire staff of the Tangshan Power Plant, inspired by Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," has achieved new results in production.
    When discussing the national plan for July at the beginning of the month, all the groups in the plant stated that in order to greet the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, they would practice strict economy, ensure safe and economical power transmission, and overfulfill the national plan for July; and they also formulated group guarantee conditions. After the publication of Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report in the newspaper, the staff were even more delighted and excited. After study and discussion, the entire plant launched a labor emulation campaign centered on ensuring safety, using more low-value coal, and saving electricity for plant use. Zhou Enrong, a sixty-year-old master worker and leader of the boiler workshop who was on sick leave, said: "The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the national power generation should be more than doubled in five years, which is the responsibility of our power industry workers. In the future, we must overcome difficulties and reduce coal consumption." He also went to his colleagues while ill to study how to save fuel and reduce coal consumption for the country. Up to the 13th, the coal consumption of each shift in the boiler workshop was the most significantly reduced by their shift, from the original plan of 0.575 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour to 0.449 kg. Jing Xutian, the welding team leader of the repair shop, tapped the potential of the welding machine, successfully improved the welding machine, and increased work efficiency eightfold.
    From July 7th to 15th, the plant's main economic quota indicators declined daily: coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was 2.46% lower than the original plan, plant electricity consumption rate was 7.91% lower, and fuel cost was 1.38% lower. During this period, there were no accidents, and misoperations and minor errors in production were also greatly reduced. Therefore, the national plan for the first half of July was overfulfilled. All the staff are determined to continue their efforts and greet the First Five-Year Plan with new production achievements.

    为全部实现第一个五年计划而奋斗
    开展劳动竞赛，用新的生产成绩迎接第一个五年计划编辑同志：
    唐山发电厂全体职工在李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”的鼓舞下，生产上获得了新的成绩。
    全厂各个小组在月初讨论七月份国家计划的时候，就表示为了迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的召开，要厉行节约，保证安全地经济地发送电，超额完成七月份国家计划；并且还分别制定了小组保证条件。报上发表了李富春副总理的报告以后，职工们更是欢欣鼓舞，兴奋万分。经过学习和讨论，全厂展开了以保证安全为中心的多用低值煤和节省厂用电的劳动竞赛。因病休养的锅炉车间领班班长、六十岁的周恩荣老师傅说：“第一个五年计划规定五年内全国发电量要增加一倍以上，这是我们电业工人的责任。今后我们一定要克服困难，降低煤耗。”他还抱病去找班里的伙伴们研究怎样给国家节约燃煤、降低煤耗的问题。到十三日止，锅炉车间各班的煤耗，数他们这个班降低得最显著，由原计划每发一度电需煤零点五七五公斤降低到零点四四九公斤。修配场电焊班长靖绪田挖掘电焊机潜力，改进电焊机成功，提高工作效率八倍。
    从七月七日到十五日，全厂各项主要经济定额指标逐日下降：每发一度电的煤耗比原计划降低百分之二点四六，厂用电率降低百分之七点九一，燃料成本降低百分之一点三八。在这期间中没有发生任何事故，生产中的误操作和小错误也大大减少。因此，超额完成了七月上半月的国家计划。全厂职工还决心继续努力，要用新的生产成绩来迎接第一个五年计划。
