IV. Striving to Complete and Overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan

Dear Representatives:

The State Council of the People's Republic of China submits to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress the proposal for the development of the national economy for the first five-year plan. I now report on behalf of the State Council to this session regarding the first five-year plan.

The draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China was compiled under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. In March 1955, it was discussed and basically approved by the National Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China. After the Central Committee of the Party revised the draft based on the opinions discussed at the Party's National Representative Conference, it was submitted to the State Council. The State Council discussed and unanimously approved this five-year plan draft and now requests the Second Session of the First National People's Congress to review and approve it.

Our first five-year plan began to be implemented on the basis of the recovery of the national economy. Before national liberation, the national economy of our country suffered severe plundering and destruction by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people's lives were miserable. The people's revolution overthrew the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and transformed the major economic lifelines originally monopolized by imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie, such as large banks, large industries, large commerce, and railways, into public property. It also transformed the land ownership of landlords into the land ownership of peasants. This made it possible for the people of our country to quickly create a new life. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, relying on the high enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and the broad masses of the people in the labor front, relying on the victories of the people in various fronts such as land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and carrying out the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," and relying on the correct economic policies of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, as well as the support of the great Soviet Union and other people's democracies, we successfully completed the task of restoring the national economy. In 1952, the year when our country ended the economic recovery period, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country (including the total output value of industry, handicrafts, agriculture, and rural sideline occupations, all calculated at 1952 constant prices) increased by 77.5% compared to 1949. Among them, modern industry increased by 178.6%, and agriculture (including rural sideline occupations) increased by 48.5%. In 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products, except for a few, all exceeded the highest levels before liberation. Due to the relatively rapid recovery and development of modern industry, its share in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 17% in 1949 to 26.7% in 1952. While industrial and agricultural production was being restored and developed, transportation and postal services also experienced corresponding restoration and development. The significant achievements in balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices played a notable role in the rapid restoration of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives.

During the recovery period, we began to carry out the transformation of the national economy. The socialist economic component gradually strengthened its leading position in the national economy. During this period, both public and private industries developed, but the development speed of state-owned industries far exceeded that of private industries. Some private industries have already transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Therefore, the share of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private industries in the total industrial output value (including modern industry and factory handicrafts, excluding cooperative handicrafts and individual handicrafts) increased from 36.7% in 1949 to 61% in 1952, while the share of private industry decreased from 63.3% in 1949 to 39% in 1952. During the same period, the mutual aid and cooperative movement in agriculture also made initial progress. In 1952, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for 63% of domestic commercial wholesale and 34% of social retail, and foreign trade was under state control. In general, the leading role and position of the socialist economy in the national economy have been greatly strengthened with the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, thereby greatly paving the way for our country to implement planned economy and requiring us to start formulating long-term plans for the development of the national economy.

The sincere, selfless, and fraternal aid from the Soviet Union is an important condition for our country to carry out planned economic construction rapidly. The Soviet government and people helped our country design new enterprises and supply the equipment needed for construction, as well as other series of aids, which demonstrated the greatest and most sublime internationalism. As Stalin said: "The issue is not only that this aid is extremely cheap and technologically first-class. The issue is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and to seek common economic prosperity."

The period of our first five-year plan is from 1953 to 1957. The drafting of this plan began in 1951, and after multiple supplements and revisions, it was completed in February 1955, after the first five-year plan had been implemented for two years. This is because our country lacks resource surveys, statistical data is scarce, there are multiple economic components coexisting, we have no experience in drafting long-term plans, and construction experience is insufficient. Moreover, from the overall situation of the country, the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which began in 1950, only achieved an armistice in late July 1953. The main part of the 156 industrial units that the Soviet Union helped our country build—the second batch of 91 units—was only confirmed in May 1953. All these indicate that in the past two years, we could only build while drafting long-term plans. Although this is the case, since our country completed the restoration of the national economy in 1952, we have been able to draft and implement annual plans for the development of the national economy since 1953. The first batch of 50 units that the Soviet Union helped our country build was confirmed as early as 1950 and construction began immediately, so we did not lose time in construction. Moreover, because we have carried out many preparatory tasks and gained a lot of experience in the process of implementing two annual plans, this makes our first five-year plan more in line with reality and more guaranteed to be completed successfully.

Now, I will explain the following about the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country.

I. The Overall Task of the State in the Transition Period

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country was formulated based on the general line for the transitional period of the Communist Party of China, which was proposed in 1952, i.e., the overall task of the state in the transitional period.

The entire revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China includes two stages: the New Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution. The task of the first stage of the Chinese revolution was to lead the masses of the people to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, transforming a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society into a New Democratic society. This task has been successfully completed. The founding of the People's Republic of China marks the basic end of the first stage of the Chinese revolution and the beginning of the second stage. The task of the second stage of the Chinese revolution is to build a socialist society in China.

According to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, in any country, socialism cannot be established all at once. After the proletariat overthrows the reactionary rule and achieves revolutionary victory, before the establishment of a socialist society, there must be a transitional period. Lenin pointed out that after the proletariat seizes power, it must use its political ruling position to solve the economic tasks of socialism. To solve the economic tasks of socialism, it is not only necessary to develop an industrial system based on heavy industry but also to transform the national economy, including agriculture, to the technical foundation of large-scale production, and to transform the national economy, which includes various economic components, into a single socialist economy.

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the teachings of Lenin about the transitional period, summarized the experience since the founding of the People's Republic of China and proposed the general line for the transitional period of the Party in 1952. The general line for the transitional period of the Party, proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was accepted by the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954 and included in our country's constitution as the overall task of the state in the transitional period. The preamble of the constitution stipulates: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the establishment of a socialist society, this is a transitional period. The overall task of the state in the transitional period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the state and to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." The fourth article of the constitution also stipulates: "The People's Republic of China, relying on state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, will gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and establish a socialist society."

The construction of socialism in our country is centered on socialist industrialization, while the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are two necessary components. These three are inseparable.

Heavy industry is the material foundation for building a socialist society. Lenin repeatedly pointed out: "The real and only foundation for building a socialist society is one, that is, heavy industry." Without heavy industry, we cannot transition to socialism and cannot transform agriculture and the entire national economy on the basis of modern technology.

Everyone knows that our country was once a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country under the rule of imperialism, with a very backward economy. Before liberation, modern industry in our country accounted for a very small share of the national economy, and most of it was light industry, many of which were processing industries dependent on imported raw materials from foreign countries. As for the foundation of heavy industry, it was even weaker. Although there were some heavy industries, most of them were machine repair shops of imperialist countries in China or mines and factories that provided raw materials and semi-finished products to imperialist countries. The backward state of the national economy of our country, caused by the lack of a foundation for heavy industry, made our country weak and poor for more than a hundred years, suffering from the invasion and oppression of various imperialist powers. The Kuomintang reactionaries, led by Chiang Kai-shek, ruled China for more than twenty years, greatly deepening the backward state of our country. They only cared about ruthlessly plundering the people and did not establish any industry. For a long time, they boasted about building a steel plant with an annual output of ten million tons, but year after year passed, their families became increasingly rich, but they still could not build even such a small-scale steel plant. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the entire country, except for Northeast China, produced only about four million tons of steel per year, and these were all products of steel plants built during the late Qing Dynasty and the warlord era. After Japan occupied Northeast China, especially from 1939 to 1943, to plunder resources and expand the war of aggression, it expanded some steel industries there. Of course, these were colonial-style industries purely subordinate to the industrial system of the Japanese homeland, and many factories and mines were later severely damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his 1945 book "On Coalition Government": "Without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry." After national liberation, the people took power, and such an independent, free, democratic, and unified new China appeared. A new China that is industrialized is in sight. Such a new China is what the Chinese people have obtained through long-term bloody struggles under the leadership of the working class, so the path of national industrialization can only be socialist industrialization. Only socialist industrialization can overcome the contradiction between our advanced political power and backward economy and transform a weak China into a truly strong and prosperous China.

Socialist industrialization is the central task of our country in the transitional period, and the key link of socialist industrialization is to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Only by establishing a powerful heavy industry, that is, establishing modern steel, machinery manufacturing, power, fuel, non-ferrous metals, basic chemical industries, etc., can we manufacture modern industrial equipment, transform heavy industry itself and light industry technologically; we can provide agriculture with tractors and other modern agricultural machinery, provide agriculture with sufficient fertilizers, and transform agriculture technologically; we can produce modern means of transportation, such as locomotives, automobiles, ships, airplanes, etc., and transform the transportation industry technologically; we can also manufacture modern weapons to equip the warriors defending the motherland, making national defense more solid. At the same time, only on the basis of the development of heavy industry can we significantly improve production technology and labor productivity, continuously increase the production of agriculture and consumer goods industries, and ensure the continuous improvement of the living standards of the people. It can be seen that the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the only correct policy for making the country rich and the people happy. Implementing this policy will lay a solid material foundation for socialism in our country. Some people think: The international environment of our country is different from the situation after the victory of the Soviet revolution. We now have the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democracies, so why rush to industrialize? We believe that this view is wrong. We face the backward state of the national economy at home, and there are still vicious imperialists surrounding us abroad. If we do not implement socialist industrialization, we will not only be unable to build a socialist society in our country but also face the danger of being unable to resist imperialist aggression and maintain economic and political independence. It can be seen that realizing socialist industrialization and developing the national economy in China is a responsibility that the Chinese people themselves should undertake. The help of the Soviet Union and other people's democracies to our country is a favorable condition for our country to realize socialist industrialization. We should strive even harder to build under such conditions and fight to accelerate the task of realizing socialist industrialization.

To build socialism, we must solve the contradiction between small-scale peasant economy and socialist industrialization. Socialism cannot be established on the basis of small-scale peasant economy but can only be established on the basis of large-scale industrial economy and collective large-scale agricultural economy. Socialist industrialization requires agriculture to transform from a dispersed and backward mode of production to a collective and advanced mode of production, producing more grain and industrial raw materials on the basis of collectivization and mechanization, and also requires individual handicrafts to take the path of cooperation. The vast majority of peasants must ultimately free themselves from poverty and suffering and must leave the old path of long-term individual small-scale production and turn to the new path of collectivized and mechanized socialist agriculture. Therefore, we must carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, that is, according to the provisions of Articles 8 and 9 of the Constitution, encourage individual peasants to organize production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperatives based on the principle of voluntariness, and encourage individual handicraft workers and other non-agricultural individual laborers to organize production and supply and marketing cooperatives based on the principle of voluntariness. Some people think: After the land reform, Chinese peasants have already obtained land, and their production enthusiasm is high, so why implement cooperation? We believe that this view is also wrong. The reform of the feudal land system is only the first step in the liberation of the peasants, because they still cultivate small plots of land in a dispersed manner, cannot use modern agricultural machinery, and cannot further develop production and resist natural disasters, nor can they avoid urban and rural capitalist exploitation, let alone mention encountering serious natural disasters and unexpected accidents. Only by gradually transforming agriculture and handicrafts from individual operations to collective operations and equipping them with modern technology on this basis can we greatly develop the productive forces of agriculture, expand agricultural reproduction, increase production, meet the requirements of the socialist industrialization of the country, and also limit and eliminate the basis for the development of capitalism, enabling the vast majority of peasants and handicraft workers to permanently free themselves from poverty and suffering and obtain a universally prosperous life.

To build socialism, we must also solve the contradiction between capitalist economy and socialist economy. The private ownership of the means of production in the capitalist economy hinders the further development of the productive forces of our country, and the anarchic state of the capitalist economy is opposed to the planned development of the socialist economy. With the development of the national economy and the implementation of planned leadership, the contradiction between the capitalist economy and the socialist economy becomes more prominent and acute. Therefore, we must carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, that is, according to the provisions of Article 10 of the Constitution: "The state adopts a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. The state, through the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, utilizes the positive role of capitalist industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, restricts its negative role that is not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and encourages and guides it to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy, gradually replacing capitalist ownership with public ownership." Some people hope that the socialist economy and the capitalist economy can coexist for a long time in one country and hope that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will not be carried out, or not yet be carried out. We believe that this idea is also wrong. The two opposing production relations of socialism and capitalism cannot coexist in one country without interfering with each other. Not taking the socialist path means taking the capitalist path, and the latter path is something that the Chinese people will never allow. Taking the socialist path is the inevitable law of the historical development of our country. Under the current specific political and economic conditions of our country, transforming capitalist industry and commerce through various forms of state capitalism and gradually transforming them into socialist enterprises is not only necessary but also possible, as proven by the actual experience of the past five years.

The above points show that to build socialism, we must actively realize socialist industrialization and simultaneously realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. However, does this mean that we can complete the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation in the first five-year plan period? No. According to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, we should regard the transition to socialism as a historical period. Our country is a large country with complex conditions, and the national economy was originally very backward. There are more than 110 million peasant households with small-scale peasant economy, a large number of handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce still account for a considerable share of the national economy. Therefore, the work of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation in our country is arduous and time-consuming, and it will take a relatively long time. According to the actual situation of our country, to complete the overall task of the transitional period, in addition to the three years of the recovery period, it will probably take another fifteen years, that is, it will probably take three five-year plans. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: We will work hard and build for about fifteen years and may basically build a socialist society, but to build a powerful, highly socialist industrialized country, it will take decades of effort, for example, it will take forty or fifty years, that is, the entire second half of this century.

In the process of building socialism in our country, when carrying out socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, we should follow the actual situation of our country at present and adopt feasible measures to gradually realize them. In industrial construction, we must proceed with construction according to the possible financial and technological resources, adhering to the principle of concentrating on key projects. The idea of not distinguishing between important and unimportant tasks and thinking that construction should be large-scale and modern everywhere is harmful to the realization of socialist industrialization. Building a modern heavy industry enterprise generally takes about five years, involving a series of heavy work, and requires coordination from all aspects. We want to build many industrial enterprises equipped with modern technology to achieve industrialization. Can we hope to build successfully in a short period without much effort? The collectivization and mechanization of agriculture and handicrafts cannot be easily completed in a short period. This is a fundamental reform of the production and living methods of tens of millions of peasants and thousands of handicraft workers, requiring them to completely abandon the old path of individual small-scale production and turn to a new path of socialist development. Therefore, it is necessary to go through some necessary transitional forms over a considerable period to gradually complete this. The realization of the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts not only requires the overall development of the economy to help agriculture and handicrafts but also requires peasants and handicraft workers to have cultural knowledge and their personal experience. All these require time. The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce should also be gradually completed through some necessary transitional forms.

We have won a new China, and we must speed up economic construction to protect and consolidate this new China. This construction is mainly the construction of socialist industrialization. Lenin, on the eve of the October Revolution, pointed out to the Russian people: "Either perish or entrust your fate to the most revolutionary class to quickly and radically transition to a higher mode of production." In China, the problem is the same. Chairman Mao Zedong said before liberation: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national strength." We cannot rely on backward small-scale peasant economy to live, and we must also abandon the capitalist path that impoverishes the broad masses. The liberated Chinese people, to avoid various dangers on their path forward, can only strive to realize the cause of socialist industrialization and gradually transform our country's individual agriculture, individual handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce according to socialist principles on this basis. In the transitional period, we are to solve such tasks, and based on the achievements we have already made in the recovery period and the first two years of the five-year plan, we are fully confident in solving such tasks.

II. Outline of the First Five-Year Plan

The basic task of our first five-year plan is based on the overall task of the state in the transitional period. The basic task of the first five-year plan, in summary, is: to concentrate the main forces to carry out industrial construction centered on the 156 units designed by the Soviet Union to help our country, consisting of 694 construction units above the limit, to lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country; to develop some collective-owned agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives, to lay the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; to basically incorporate capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, to lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

Our first five-year plan is a major step in realizing the overall task of the transitional period of the state. The construction scale of the first five-year plan is very large, and the development speed of various sectors of the national economy is very fast.

In five years, the total expenditure for national economic construction and cultural education construction is 766.4 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 70 million taels of gold. To carry out national construction with such a large amount of funds is unimaginable in the history of our country, and only a government that works wholeheartedly for the people under the leadership of the working class can do this.

In the total expenditure for economic construction and cultural education construction in five years, the investment in basic construction is 427.4 billion yuan, accounting for 55.8% of the total expenditure. The remaining 44.2%, which is 339 billion yuan, is partly used for resource exploration, engineering survey, engineering design, and equipment reserve needed for basic construction; partly used for the development of industrial production and transportation, such as major equipment repairs, technical organizational measures, trial production of new types of products, and miscellaneous fixed asset purchases; partly is the working capital of various economic sectors; and partly is the operational funds and professional cadre training funds of economic and cultural education sectors. The five-year basic construction investment of 427.4 billion yuan is distributed as follows: 248.5 billion yuan for the industrial sector, accounting for 58.2%; 32.6 billion yuan for the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sectors, accounting for 7.6%; 82.1 billion yuan for the transportation and postal sectors, accounting for 19.2%; 12.8 billion yuan for the trade, banking, and material reserve sectors, accounting for 3%; 30.8 billion yuan for the cultural, educational, and health sectors, accounting for 7.2%; 16 billion yuan for urban public utilities construction, accounting for 3.7%; and 4.6 billion yuan for others, accounting for 1.1%. From the above distribution of basic construction investment, it can be seen that the focus of investment is on industry. It can also be seen that the distribution of investment has also taken into account the needs of the development of various sectors outside of industry. The proportion of state investment in agriculture in our first five-year plan is not large. This is because mechanization cannot be widely implemented in agriculture in five years, and large-scale water conservancy construction and forestry construction cannot be fully carried out; at the same time, the basic construction investment of the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sectors does not include agricultural disaster relief funds, agricultural loans, etc., and does not include the funds invested by farmers themselves in production. If these funds are all included, then the total funds for agricultural development in five years will be close to the investment figures for industry. The proportion of investment in transportation in our first five-year plan is also not large, but it can basically guarantee the needs of the first five-year plan period and the initial period of the second five-year plan. In five years, the new and reconstructed industrial basic construction units, including the 156 units that the Soviet Union helped our country build, will have 694 units above the limit. In addition to agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, there will be 252 units; in transportation, communications, and postal services, there will be 220 units; in culture, education, and health, there will be 156 units; in urban public utilities, there will be 118 units; and in other sectors, there will be 160 units. The total number of basic construction units above the limit will be 1,600. In addition to the basic construction units above the limit, there will be more than 6,000 basic construction units below the limit, of which about 2,300 will be in industry. The basic construction units above the limit can be completed in five years, with 455 in industry, and a total of 1,271 in other sectors; most of the basic construction units below the limit can be completed. The completion of these construction units will greatly improve the productive forces of our country's industry, promote the development of agriculture, increase transportation capacity, and expand cultural and educational undertakings.

The state, for the convenience of managing and controlling major basic construction units, has formulated investment limits for various types of basic construction units according to the specific situation of our country. Any construction unit, regardless of whether it is new, reconstructed, or restored, if its total investment exceeds the limit, is a basic construction unit above the limit; if it is below the limit, it is a basic construction unit below the limit.

For example, in industry, the investment limits for various types of industrial basic construction units are stipulated as follows: the investment limit for steel, automobile manufacturing, tractor manufacturing, shipbuilding, and locomotive and vehicle manufacturing industries is 100 million yuan; the investment limit for non-ferrous metal, chemical, and cement industries is 60 million yuan; the investment limit for power plants, power transmission lines and substations, coal mining, petroleum extraction, petroleum processing, machinery manufacturing (excluding transportation machinery), automobile and ship repair, and textile (including dyeing) industries is 50 million yuan; the investment limit for rubber, papermaking, sugar manufacturing, cigarette, and pharmaceutical industries is 40 million yuan; the investment limit for ceramic, food (excluding sugar manufacturing), and other light industries is 30 million yuan. Including basic construction units above and below the limit, the main industrial products' construction scale and the increase in annual production capacity in five years are as follows:

Iron: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 575 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 280 million tons.

Steel: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 610 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 253 million tons.

Electricity: The increased generating capacity after full completion will be 40.6 million kilowatts, and the increased generating capacity in five years will be 20.5 million kilowatts.

Raw coal: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 931 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 538.5 million tons.

Metallurgical machinery and mining machinery: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 1.9 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 700,000 tons.

Power generation equipment: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 8 million kilowatts, and it will be fully completed in five years.

Automobiles: The annual production capacity after full completion will be 90,000 vehicles, and the annual production capacity reached in five years will be 30,000 vehicles.

Tractors: The annual production capacity after full completion will be 15,000 units, and it will be completed in 1959.

Chemical fertilizers: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 9.1 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 2.8 million tons.

Cement: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 36 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 23.6 million tons.

Cotton spindles: The increased spindles after full completion will be 18.9 million, and 16.5 million spindles will be put into production in five years.

Machine-made paper: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 1.86 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 950,000 tons.

Machine-made sugar: The increased annual production capacity after full completion will be 5.6 million tons, and the increased annual production capacity in five years will be 4.28 million tons.

In terms of transportation, in five years, the newly completed railway trunk lines and branch lines will total more than 4,000 kilometers. In addition to the restoration of railways, the reconstruction of railways, the construction of new double tracks, the extension of station lines, and industrial and other dedicated lines, the total length of railways will increase by about 10,000 kilometers. In five years, more than 10,000 kilometers of highways will be built, and the newly increased operating mileage will be more than 7,100 kilometers. In five years, 40 million deadweight tons of ships will be added.

In terms of agriculture and water conservancy, in five years, 91 state-owned mechanized farms and 194 tractor stations will be newly built. In addition to the construction of 13 large reservoirs, the excavation of river channels will have a soil and stone volume of 13 billion cubic meters, and the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River will begin.

In five years, the total building area of factories, worker and staff dormitories, schools, hospitals, etc., will be approximately 1.5 billion square meters.

Industrial construction is the center of our first five-year plan, and the construction of the 156 industrial units under Soviet aid is the center of industrial construction. The 156 industrial units that the Soviet Union helped our country build, 145 units started construction during the first five-year plan period, and the remaining 11 units conducted surveys and design during the first five-year plan period and will start construction during the second five-year plan period. These industrial construction units are large in scale and advanced in technology. Many of them are completely new achievements in the history of our country's industry. For example:

The Anshan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, based on its original production scale, will basically complete the reconstruction and new construction of the following 48 major projects from 1953 to 1960: three iron mines, eight beneficiation plants and sintering plants, six automated blast furnaces, three new-style steel plants, 16 steel rolling mills, 10 coke ovens, and two refractory material workshops. The reconstruction and new construction of these plants and workshops will make full use of the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union. This, the largest iron and steel united enterprise in our country, after the reconstruction is completed, its production scale can be expanded to an annual output of 250 million tons of pig iron, 322 million tons of steel, and 248 million tons of steel products. The various specifications of steel products, steel plates, and steel pipes it produces can basically meet the needs of manufacturing locomotives, ships, automobiles, tractors, etc., in the first five-year plan and the initial period of the second five-year plan in the country; the various specifications of steel rails it produces can be used to lay more than 3,000 kilometers of railways each year.

While reconstructing the Anshan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, the construction of the Wuhan and Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprises will be carried out.

In five years, power stations with a generating capacity of more than 50,000 kilowatts will have 15 thermal power stations; the Fengman Hydropower Station, after reconstruction, will have a generating capacity of more than 560,000 kilowatts. The completion of these construction units will greatly strengthen the power supply capacity of various regions.

In five years, coal mining enterprises with a design capacity (including existing production capacity) of more than 100 million tons of coal per year will have 31. Among them, the five largest coal mining enterprises will reach the following annual production capacities in 1957: Fushun Mining Bureau's coal mines will be 930 million tons, Fuxin Mining Bureau's coal mines will be 845 million tons, Kailuan Coal Mine will be 968 million tons, Datong Mining Bureau's coal mines will be 645 million tons, and Huainan Mining Bureau's coal mines will be 685 million tons. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which will be built and completed in five years, will be able to produce 30,000 heavy-duty trucks per year after its production capacity is fully utilized. The Second Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which is twice the size of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, will also begin construction during the first five-year plan period. These two automobile manufacturing plants will lay the foundation for our country's automobile manufacturing industry.

In five years, the construction of tractor manufacturing plants will begin. During the second five-year plan period, our country will be able to produce 15,000 tractors with 54 horsepower per year, meeting the needs of agriculture.

In five years, the construction of two heavy machinery manufacturing plants (one designed with Soviet help and one designed by our country) will begin. After construction is completed, according to the design capacity, their products can equip an annual steel production of 160 million tons of iron and steel united enterprise every year, supplying a full set of equipment for smelting iron, smelting steel, rolling steel, and coking.

In five years, the construction of factories manufacturing power generation equipment will begin. After all construction is completed, our country will be able to manufacture power generation equipment with a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts, 25,000 kilowatts, and even 50,000 kilowatts per unit, meeting the needs of various sectors of the national economy to build power stations.

Many of our country's light industry factories are designed and built by domestic efforts, and many factories are also quite large in scale. For example, in our capital Beijing, three cotton textile mills are being built, equipped with 230,000 spindles and more than 7,000 looms. In five years, 39 textile mills with relatively large scales will be built.

Not only are many industrial construction units large in scale, but many railway, highway, water conservancy, and other construction units are also large in scale. For example:

In five years, the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which connects Gansu and Xinjiang, the railway from Baoji to Chengdu, which connects Northwest and Southwest China, the railway from Yingtan to Xiamen, which connects Jiangxi and Fujian, and the railway from Jining to Erlian, which connects our country with the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union, will be carried out. These railways are not only long but also have to pass through desert areas or cross high mountains and steep ridges, and the construction projects are very large.

In five years, the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, which have a total length of more than 4,300 kilometers, will continue. These highways are opened up in sparsely populated areas at an altitude of several thousand meters, and the construction projects are particularly arduous. In five years, the construction of the Huai River comprehensive treatment project will continue. It is planned to build four large reservoirs, Nanwan, Boshan, Foziling, and Meishan, with a total capacity of more than 38 billion cubic meters; at the same time, flood control and drainage projects will be carried out on major tributaries such as the Hong River, Yu River, Si River, and Bei River. The Guanting Reservoir, which was completed in 1954, can store 23 billion cubic meters of water and will play a major role in preventing water disasters in the lower reaches of the Yongding River.

In five years, the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River will begin. The Yellow River is more than 4,800 kilometers long, flows through seven provinces, and has a drainage area of 745,000 square kilometers. It has always been the most severely affected river in our country's history. According to the comprehensive utilization plan of the Yellow River, dozens of dams will be built in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and its major tributaries, and giant water storage and hydroelectric power stations will be built in five places such as Sanmenxia to regulate the flow. During the first five-year plan period, the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River will complete the river basin planning and begin the construction of the water conservancy and hydroelectric hub project at Sanmenxia.

The state-owned Friendship Farm, built with direct help from the Soviet Union, will cultivate 375,000 mu of wasteland. This farm is equipped with a large number of modern mechanical equipment donated by the Soviet Union and will play an important role in demonstrating and leading the mechanization of agriculture in our country in the future.

With the direct help of the Soviet Union, our country will begin the construction of peaceful use of atomic energy in five years, making it serve the national economy.

The above examples are sufficient to show that we are doing great things for the happiness of the people of the whole country and future generations. The completion of the tasks of industrial construction and other construction specified in our first five-year plan will undoubtedly play a very important role in promoting the socialist industrialization of our country and changing the backward economic face of our country. This socialist economic construction represents the long-term and highest interests of the Chinese people as a whole.

During the first five-year plan period, due to the utilization of the production capacity of existing industrial enterprises and the investment of new and reconstructed industrial enterprises in production, the productive forces of our country's industry will be greatly improved. By 1957, the share of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase from 26.7% in 1952 to 36%. In 1957, compared to 1952, the total industrial output value of our country will increase by 98.3%, that is, an average annual increase of 14.7%. Among them, modern industry will increase by 104.1%, that is, an average annual increase of 15.3%. Such a speed of industrial development in our country is undoubtedly high and is impossible in capitalist countries.

In five years, the output of various industrial products will increase significantly. The planned output in 1957 compared to the output in 1952 is as follows: Steel: from 135 million tons to 412 million tons, an increase of 2.1 times. Electricity generation: from 72.6 billion kilowatt-hours to 159 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 1.2 times. Raw coal: from 635.3 million tons to 1.13 billion tons, an increase of 0.8 times. Electric generators: from 30,000 kilowatts to 227,000 kilowatts, an increase of 6.7 times. Electric motors: from 640,000 kilowatts to 1,050,000 kilowatts, an increase of 0.6 times. Heavy-duty trucks: reaching 4,000 vehicles (in 1952, we could not produce them). Cement: from 286 million tons to 600 million tons, an increase of 1.1 times. Machine-made paper: from 37 million tons to 65 million tons, an increase of 0.8 times. Cotton cloth: from 1.1163 billion meters to 1.6372 billion meters, an increase of 0.5 times. Machine-made sugar: from 2.49 million tons to 6.86 million tons, an increase of 1.8 times.

Some people may think: After the completion of the first five-year plan, the steel production of our country is only about 400 million tons, which is not only far behind the United States and Britain but also behind Japan. Is this in line with the status of China as a major country? We believe that this only sees one side of the matter and does not see the other side. The United States, Britain, Japan, and other countries, as well as other countries with relatively developed industries, have a history of industrial development of one or two hundred years, and the shortest is nearly one hundred years. The history of industrial development in our country lags behind theirs by more than one hundred years or several decades. Only after the people took power in our country was it possible to carry out planned construction. In 1907, our country built the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant, and the steel production that year was only 8,500 tons. By 1933, the national steel production was only 25,000 tons. In 1936, the national steel production exceeded 40 million tons, but 364,000 tons were produced in Northeast China, which was then under the occupation of Japanese imperialism. The highest year of steel production in the history of our country was 1943, with an output of 180 million tons of pig iron and 90 million tons of steel, but most of it was produced in Northeast China under Japanese occupation. Due to the sabotage of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, in the year the People's Republic of China was founded, that is, 1949, the national pig iron production was only 24.6 million tons, and the steel production was only 15.8 million tons. It can be seen that we inherited the extremely miserable legacy of old China. After national liberation, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people took on the arduous task of changing the backward economy and culture of China, and in a short three years, they restored the national economy and made some progress, and then in five years, they will increase industrial production by onefold. We do not have the ability to "summon the wind and rain" from the "Deities' List," so how can we catch up with industrially developed capitalist countries in five years? Stalin once said: "One must not confuse the speed of industrial development with the level of industrial development." Our speed of industrial development will be fast, but in terms of the level of industrial development, we will still be behind some capitalist countries for a certain period, so we must catch up. We can confidently say that catching up with or surpassing their level of industrial development does not require a hundred years, but only a few decades. We have only used five years to surpass the several decades of the reactionary ruling era in China. Is such a speed of industrial development slow?

The national industrialization that our country aims to achieve is socialist industrialization, which is industrialization modeled after the Soviet Union and directly aided by the Soviet Union and other people's democracies, not capitalist industrialization. Therefore, our industry, especially the industry that manufactures means of production, can develop at a very high speed. According to the first five-year plan, in the investment of industrial basic construction, the investment in the industry that manufactures means of production accounts for 88.8%, and the investment in the industry that manufactures means of consumption accounts for 11.2%. At the same time, according to the plan, the output value of means of production will increase by 126.5% in five years, and the output value of means of consumption will increase by 79.7%. Therefore, the share of the output value of means of production in the total industrial output value will increase from 39.7% in 1952 to 45.4% in 1957, and the share of the output value of means of consumption will decrease from 60.3% in 1952 to 54.6% in 1957.

The change in the ratio of the growth of production between socialist industry and capitalist industry also reflects the socialist characteristics of the development of our industry. In five years, the growth of the output value of state-owned industry will be 130.1%; the development speed of cooperative industry and joint state-private industry that existed before the five-year plan is also very fast; the output value of private industry will have half of it transformed into joint state-private industry in five years. Therefore, by 1957, in the total industrial output value of the country, the share of the output value of state-owned, cooperative (including processing factories of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, excluding handicraft production cooperatives), and joint state-private industry will increase to 87.8%, and the share of the output value of private industry will decrease to 12.2%. Moreover, most of it will accept state processing orders, basically incorporating it into the track of state capitalism.

The first five-year plan sets appropriate increase targets for agriculture. In five years, the total output value of agriculture and its sideline occupations will increase by 23.3%, that is, an average annual increase of 4.3%.

According to the plan, the planned output in 1957 and its increase compared to 1952 for major agricultural products are as follows: Grain: reaching 385.6 billion jin, an increase of 17.6%. Cotton: reaching 32.7 million dan, an increase of 25.4%. Hemp and jute: reaching 7.3 million dan, an increase of 19.7%. Flue-cured tobacco: reaching 7.8 million dan, an increase of 76.6%. Sugarcane: reaching 26.3 billion jin, an increase of 85.1%. Sugar beet: reaching 4.27 billion jin, an increase of 346.4%.

Oil crops: calculated by sowing area, reaching 118 million mu, an increase of 37.8%.

Overcoming the contradiction that agricultural development lags far behind industrial development is a major task of the five-year plan. During the period when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled our country, agricultural production not only did not develop but was also severely destroyed. In 1936, the grain production was 300 billion jin, and it decreased almost every year thereafter. By 1949, the grain production was only 226 billion jin, and the cotton production was only 8.8 million dan. After liberation, in just three years, the grain production of our country in 1952 reached 327.8 billion jin, and the cotton production reached 26 million dan, both exceeding the highest annual production before liberation. The five-year agricultural plan further increased these figures based on the 1952 base. Given the specific conditions of our country at present, the speed of agricultural development is not low and should be striven to complete and even overfulfill.

Agricultural production cooperatives are the foundation of agricultural increase during the first five-year plan period and are also the necessary path for the transformation of small-scale peasant economy. By 1957, the proportion of peasant households participating in the existing primary form of agricultural production cooperatives in the total number of peasant households in the country will reach about one-third.

In response to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the people's demand for transportation, transportation and postal services will also develop accordingly during the first five-year plan period. By 1957, the freight turnover of railways will reach 1,210 billion ton-kilometers, an increase of onefold compared to 1952; the passenger turnover will reach 32 billion person-kilometers, an increase of 59.5%. The freight turnover of inland river barges will reach 153 billion ton-kilometers, an increase of 3.2 times compared to 1952; the passenger turnover will reach 3.4 billion person-kilometers, an increase of 78.7%. The freight turnover of coastal barges will reach 5.75 billion ton-miles, an increase of 1.9 times compared to 1952; the passenger turnover will reach 2.4 billion person-miles, an increase of nearly 1.4 times. The freight turnover of highway trucks will reach 32 billion ton-kilometers, an increase of 3.7 times compared to 1952; the passenger turnover will reach 57 billion person-kilometers, an increase of nearly twofold. The freight turnover of civil aviation will reach 805 million ton-kilometers, an increase of 2.3 times compared to 1952. The total length of postal routes will reach 1.97 million kilometers, an increase of 45.2% compared to 1952; other postal and telecommunications services will also develop to a considerable extent.

Based on the above development of industry and agriculture and various changes in proportions, the total retail sales of social commodities in the country in 1957 will reach approximately 49.8 billion yuan, an increase of about 80% compared to 1952. Among them: state-owned commerce will increase by approximately 133.2%, and cooperative commerce will increase by approximately 239.5%. The original private commerce will undergo socialist transformation in five years, and about half of it will transform into various forms of state capitalist commerce and cooperative forms of small commerce. The total retail sales of these two types of commerce and private commerce will still increase. By 1957, in the total retail sales, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce will account for 54.9%, various forms of state capitalist commerce and cooperative forms of small commerce will account for 24%, and private commerce will account for 21.1%.

In five years, cultural, educational, and scientific research undertakings will develop to a considerable extent. In 1957, compared to 1952, the number of students in higher education will increase by 127%, reaching 434,000; the number of students in senior middle schools will increase by 178%, reaching 724,000; the number of students in junior middle schools will increase by 78.6%, reaching 39.83 million; the number of primary school students will increase by 18%, reaching 60.23 million, which is more than 70% of the school-age children in the country. In five years, scientific research undertakings will develop significantly, and only the research institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences will increase by 23, and the number of researchers will increase by 3,400. In publishing, broadcasting, literature and art, film, and social culture, there will also be different degrees of relatively rapid development in five years.

The five-year plan has made appropriate provisions for the improvement of the people's material living standards. In five years, the number of employed people will increase by approximately 4.2 million, and the average wage of workers and staff will increase by approximately 33% in terms of currency; the labor insurance fund, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and cultural and educational expenses paid by state-owned enterprises and state organs will total more than 5 billion yuan; the state will allocate funds to build housing for workers and staff, totaling approximately 460 million square meters. In five years, the living conditions of rural people will gradually improve, and with the development of production and the increase in the degree of commodification, purchasing power will increase by nearly onefold. The state will allocate a certain amount of funds to relieve farmers and other laborers who are in difficulty in production and life due to disasters. The public health undertaking will develop significantly, and the number of hospital beds will increase by 77%, and the number of doctors will increase by 74%, and the strength of traditional Chinese medicine will be brought into play.

Everyone can see that the implementation of the first five-year plan will bring about major changes in our national economy. In five years, the rapid development of our industry, especially heavy industry, will begin to change the economic face of our country and lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country. In five years, the rapid development of the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts will lay the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. In five years, capitalist industry and commerce will undergo various forms of joint state-private operations, processing orders, agency sales, etc., and will gradually be incorporated into the track of state capitalism, laying the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. All these changes will undoubtedly further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, further strengthen our national defense forces, and create conditions for further improving the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Therefore, the successful completion of the first five-year plan is a major event related to the destiny of our country and the happiness of the people. It can be said that the first five-year plan is the first plan for the prosperity and strength of our country and the happiness of the people, and the realization of this plan will also strengthen the forces of the world peace and democracy camp.

After successfully implementing the first five-year plan, our country will certainly not be able to solve all aspects of the tasks of economic development. Many important construction projects started in the first five-year plan will be completed in the second five-year plan, and some will play an important role in production in the second five-year plan. At the end of the first five-year plan, in the field of industry, our country's machine manufacturing capacity and level will still not be able to meet the needs of technical transformation of various sectors of the national economy, and many large and precision machinery and equipment will not be able to be manufactured; at the same time, the regional distribution of industry, although many new industrial enterprises have been built in the interior, will still not be able to completely overcome the unreasonable state of being concentrated in one place and along the coast. In the field of agriculture, the socialist transformation of small-scale peasant economy has only been realized in the initial form of collectivization in about one-third of the peasant households, and large-scale technical transformation has not yet begun, and the state of agricultural development lagging behind the rapid development of industry will still not be completely changed. The socialist transformation of the capitalist economy has also only taken the first step, and it will take a longer time to transform them into socialist economies. In the field of culture, the scientific and technological level of our country is still lagging behind the requirements of economic development, and the cultural level of the broad masses of the people is still not high, and there is still a considerable number of illiterates. In addition, the unemployment phenomenon left over from old China will also not be completely eliminated, and the surplus labor force will not be fully utilized. These problems need us to continue to strive and solve them in the second and third five-year plans.

III. Several Issues of the First Five-Year Plan

(1) Issues Regarding the Basic Construction of Industry and Transportation

Now I would like to explain several issues regarding the basic construction of industry and transportation. These issues are the scale of basic construction, the proportion of investment in heavy and light industry, the coordination of large, medium, and small enterprises, the regional distribution of industry, the standards of basic construction, and the guarantee of engineering quality.

First, the issue of the scale of basic construction.

In the process of formulating the five-year plan, we have repeatedly considered and studied this issue many times. We believe that under the current conditions, the determined scale of construction is appropriate and is something that can and should be striven to complete in five years.

Some people have doubted whether such a scale of construction is too large. Their reason is: Our country is still a country that is economically backward and very poor, with limited national finances and insufficient technical strength, and many resource conditions are unclear. It is impossible to undertake such a large-scale basic construction in five years. Therefore, they think it is possible to reduce this scale of construction. They say not to make it so tense and reduce the tasks. They also say that "the peasants are too poor" and slow down the industrialization. We do not agree with such proposals. Our reason is just as we have said before: To get rid of the economically backward position of our country, there is no other way except to accelerate the construction of industry. At the same time, our industrialization construction is precisely to enable the peasants to have the possibility to get rid of poverty. The industrial construction units determined in the five-year plan are all necessary. If they are reduced, it will delay the speed of the entire socialist construction of our country and disrupt the deployment of national construction.

Is it possible for our country's financial resources to adapt to such a scale of construction? We reply that it is possible. The reason it is possible is that our revolution has provided us with the following sources of accumulation:

First, our people have overthrown the rule of imperialists in China, and imperialists can no longer plunder the wealth of our people on a large scale as they did in the past. This provides an important source of accumulation for our country's construction.

Second, our people have overthrown feudalism and transformed landlord land ownership into peasant land ownership. In the past, peasants had to pay high rent to landlords, but now they no longer pay rent, and peasants improve their own lives with the fruits of their labor and can also use part of it to help national construction.

Third, our people have overthrown bureaucratic capitalism and transformed the property of bureaucratic capitalists into public property. Now workers no longer produce for the profits of bureaucratic capitalists but for the needs of the state and the people. This is also an important source of accumulation for our country's construction.

Fourth, in private factories, although workers still have to turn over part of their labor results as the profits of capitalists, now capitalists can only obtain a portion of the profits as stipulated by law. A considerable part of the profits of capitalist enterprises is either paid as income tax and invested in national construction, or turned into enterprise reserves for the expansion of production. This is also beneficial to the state and the people under the conditions of people's democratic dictatorship.

All these prove that our country is not without construction funds, but in the past, a large amount of funds were put into the pockets of imperialists, landlords, and the bourgeoisie. Only after the victory of the people's revolution, our people have the possibility to use the funds created by their own labor for national construction and create a beautiful future for ourselves and our descendants. We should timely and properly use such funds.

As for the insufficiency of technical strength and the unclear situation of many resources, this is correct. But can we not learn while building with the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democracies? Can we not gradually learn skills and gradually clarify the situation while building? Chairman Mao Zedong said in his work "Strategic Problems of the Chinese Revolutionary War": "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning.... Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learning well first and then doing it, but doing it first and then learning, doing is learning." Chairman Mao here is talking about revolutionary war. However, to do any people's cause well, it is necessary to learn in practice, and this is a universal truth. The facts of the past few years have proven that we have learned many things in the actual construction, and we also know much more about the situation of resources than before. Obviously, waiting will not increase our skills and knowledge. The idea that everything must be "learned well first and then done" and therefore advocates reducing the scale of five-year construction, planning to lighten one's own responsibilities that should be undertaken and can be undertaken, is an idea that should not be adopted.

Then, can the scale of basic construction be further expanded?

According to the needs of our country, whether it is heavy industry or light industry, whether it is steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical fertilizers, petroleum, machinery, textiles, etc., the basic construction plan and production plan for these industries in the five-year plan draft are still not enough to meet the needs of the state. However, whether the scale of construction can be further expanded depends not only on whether it is needed but also on whether it is possible. We are not utopians but Marxist-Leninists. The reason we believe that the scale of the five-year plan construction is appropriate and that it should not be reduced is that according to the current objective conditions of our country, it is possible to realize it. Moreover, we believe that in the annual plan, it is possible to appropriately expand some necessary construction, such as coal mines, petroleum, railways, etc. We are already preparing to do this. In particular, the output of our country's petroleum industry is very low, far from the degree of need, and we must strive to find more petroleum resources and study the methods of developing synthetic petroleum industry to expand the scale of petroleum industry construction. But does this mean that we can ignore the financial strength, technical strength, and equipment supply of various possible objective conditions and arbitrarily and limitlessly expand all construction? Of course, things cannot be done this way. From the perspective of financial strength, the expenditure of the state on economic construction and cultural education construction in five years has reached 766.4 billion yuan. From the perspective of technical strength, the huge and complex new enterprises already stipulated in the five-year plan are all designed with the help of the Soviet Union, and our engineering and technical personnel currently lack the conditions to independently design such new enterprises. From the perspective of equipment supply, under the current situation where our country's machinery manufacturing industry lacks the ability to manufacture important equipment and complex components, it is also difficult to increase the supply of many equipment. Based on these conditions, the construction that we can further expand in five years is still within a certain limit. The idea that it is possible to expand the scale of construction without regard to possible objective conditions or that it is possible to ignore the most reasonable and effective use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources and to handle everything without confidence is wrong.

Opposing the right-wing conservatism and also opposing the "left-wing" adventurism. This is our conclusion on the issue of the scale of basic construction.

Second, the issue of the proportion of investment in heavy and light industry.

The first five-year plan of our country stipulates that the proportion of investment in heavy industry is particularly large, and it is even larger than the proportion of investment in heavy industry in the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union. As mentioned earlier, in the investment of industrial basic construction in five years, the investment in the industry that manufactures means of production accounts for 88.8%, and the investment in the industry that manufactures means of consumption accounts for 11.2%. While the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union, the investment in the industry that manufactures means of production accounts for 85.9%, and the investment in the industry that manufactures means of consumption accounts for 14.1%. The proportion of investment in heavy industry in our country is so large, while the proportion of investment in light industry is relatively small. Is this appropriate? Can the investment in heavy industry be reduced and the investment in light industry be increased?

Everyone knows that the ratio of investment in heavy and light industry must be determined based on the principle of prioritizing the growth of means of production. And in each development period, the specific regulation of this ratio should also take into account the specific conditions at that time. The current situation in our country is: the foundation of existing heavy industry is particularly weak, and we need to actively and long-term expand the foundation of heavy industry to promote the overall development of the national economy. At the same time, state-owned and private light industry still have a considerable part that has not been utilized, and there is also a vast handicraft industry that can be an important supplement. In our country, on the one hand, many light industrial products cannot fully meet the growing needs of the people, and on the other hand, many light industrial equipment are still idle, the reason is the lack of raw materials. Therefore, the current problem of developing light industry in our country is mainly not the problem of increasing investment, but the problem of increasing the production of raw materials. Before some raw materials of light industry can be increased in large quantities, increasing the investment in light industry cannot play the effect of investment, because the raw materials cannot be supplied, even if the factory is built, it cannot start production. But if agriculture is bountiful, light industrial raw materials have a significant increase, when the existing light industrial equipment is insufficient, we can consider increasing the construction of some light industrial factories in the annual plan. Because the construction of light industrial factories is relatively easy and the construction time is relatively short, it will not delay the progress of construction.

Therefore, we believe that the regulation of the proportion of investment in heavy and light industry in the first five-year plan is appropriate.

Third, the issue of the coordination of large, medium, and small enterprises.

We emphasize concentrating forces to ensure the construction of key projects. Does this mean that we can ignore or relax the construction of medium and small factories and mines? Undoubtedly, the large enterprises designed and equipped with the help of the Soviet Union, such as iron and steel combined enterprises, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, and heavy machinery manufacturing plants, are indispensable factories for our country's industrialization. Without such a batch of large, industry backbone-like factories, we cannot realize industrialization. But this does not mean that we only need large enterprises and can do without medium and small enterprises. On the contrary, medium and small enterprises can be completed and put into production in a shorter time, can quickly play the effect of investment and increase production capacity, not only play a major role in increasing the supply of industrial products and supporting agricultural production but also are indispensable forces for the increase of capital accumulation and supporting and coordinating the construction of key projects. Therefore, we must correct two wrong tendencies: one tendency is to ignore the overall situation, not to distinguish between important and unimportant tasks, and to blindly build everywhere, thereby hindering the construction of key projects; while the other tendency is to be solely infatuated with the construction of giant enterprises, to look down on the construction of medium and small enterprises, and to inappropriately concentrate national funds too much in a few giant construction units, so that the effect of investment cannot be quickly played.

Our task is to appropriately allocate the investment of large enterprises and medium and small enterprises in the process of industrial construction, so that the construction of large, medium, and small enterprises can be coordinated and cooperate with each other, to achieve the goal of both ensuring the construction of necessary key projects and ensuring that many enterprises can quickly play the effect of investment.

Fourth, the issue of the regional distribution of industry.

The regional distribution of our existing industry is very unreasonable. According to the statistics of 1952, the industrial output value of the coastal provinces accounted for more than 70% of the total industrial output value of the country. Gradually changing the unreasonable state left over from old China, reasonably distributing the productive forces of industry in various regions of the country, making industry close to the raw material and fuel production areas and consumption regions, and making the distribution of industry adapt to the conditions of consolidating national defense, gradually improving the economic level of backward regions, is an important task in the planned development of our national economy.

The five-year basic construction plan has made a more reasonable deployment for the regions, which is: on the one hand, to reasonably utilize the industrial base of Northeast, Shanghai, and other cities, to play their role, and especially to carry out necessary reconstruction for the industrial base in Northeast, centered on the Anshan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, to quickly expand the production scale and supply the needs of the national economy and support the construction of new industrial regions; on the other hand, to actively carry out the construction of new industrial bases in North China, Northwest China, Central China, and to start partial industrial construction in Southwest China. According to this policy, among the 694 industrial construction units above the limit that started construction in five years, 472 will be distributed in the interior, and 222 will be distributed in coastal areas. To adapt to the needs of industrial construction and the overall development of the national economy, to connect the original industrial bases with new industrial bases, the construction of railways in five years has also made corresponding deployment. At the same time, according to this industrial deployment policy, our current task of urban construction is not to develop large coastal cities but to develop medium and small cities in the interior and to appropriately limit the development of large cities. Now some coastal cities have the problem of blind development, which should be corrected.

Obviously, the regional distribution of industrial and railway basic construction stipulated in the five-year plan draft is in line with the long-term interests of the state. According to the deployment of this plan, by the end of the second five-year plan, our country will not only strengthen the industrial base in Northeast China but will also have some new industrial bases distributed in North China, Northwest China, and Central China. In this way, the economic life of a considerable part of our vast regions will also be greatly changed. Such industrial regional distribution is based on the development of heavy industry, so it has also begun to change the nature of the past industrial distribution.

Fifth, the issue of the standards of basic construction.

Whether it is the new construction and reconstruction of enterprises or cities, we must distinguish between productive construction and non-productive construction. In the past few years, we have neglected this distinction, and in many non-productive constructions, we have made mistakes in policy, making many non-productive construction standards far deviate from the current level of economic development of our country, deviate from the current level of social life of our country, and inappropriately build many tall buildings in many places. Moreover, many enterprises have built those auxiliary constructions that can be simplified, such as factory offices, staff dormitories, canteens, etc., into modern ones, and some have even built all the welfare facilities such as auditoriums and clubs before the new factories and mines are effectively put into production, not only are they all built, but they are also adopted very high standards. Many new industrial zone city constructions also have excessively high standards, too early requirements for modernization, and excessive emphasis on street and city appearance. All these have also wasted funds, manpower, and material resources, violated the policy of concentrating on key projects. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the National Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China, we are correcting this mistake. Our distinction of standards is as follows: many construction units above the limit, especially those belonging to key construction, must strive to adopt the latest technology, and the factory buildings should also be as far as possible to meet the requirements of the latest technological equipment; as for other non-productive construction standards, they should all be greatly reduced, and the standards of urban planning should also be reduced. By distinguishing these two standards, we can save those unnecessary and savable expenditures and use them to increase productive construction, to accelerate the speed of our country's construction. This is a major decision related to the long-term interests of our country's construction, and all state organs from the central to the local and all enterprise departments must obey this decision and cannot violate this decision. I will explain the issue of economy in the following and will not elaborate on this here.

Sixth, the issue of guaranteeing engineering quality.

The several issues I mentioned above about the basic construction of industry and transportation are policy issues. Of course, correct policy is not enough, and after having the correct policy, it is important to do the work well. Everyone knows that our current technical level is still very low, and moreover, to save time, we have to survey, design, and construct at the same time for some construction projects, and in the process of construction, we have to trial-manufacture various machinery and equipment, so some projects have serious problems such as poor quality, slow progress, and waste. The task before us is to strive to overcome these problems, and it is especially important to guarantee the quality of the project. It should be seen that the quality of new factories and mines, railways, whether good or bad, will have completely different consequences in the long term. The Baoji-Tianshui Railway built during the Kuomintang rule has extremely poor engineering quality. If it is not reconstructed in the future, it will not be able to change the state of paralysis for many days a year. In the past few years, we have repaired many factories and mines, railways, but it must be seen that repairing the original factories and mines, railways is one thing, and building new factories and mines, railways is another thing. We must not regard new construction as simple as repair. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen the following aspects of work to ensure the quality of the project:

First, improve the design work, establish the correct design concept and responsible work attitude among the design personnel, and strive to avoid errors in the design;

Second, strengthen the technical guidance of construction, strictly carry out construction according to the requirements of the design documents, and actively promote the advanced construction experience of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff, and encourage rationalization suggestions;

Third, all relevant parties must work seriously and cooperatively to ensure that the equipment and materials needed for basic construction can meet the design standards and be supplied in a timely manner;

Fourth, state organs and basic construction management departments should regularly conduct practical inspections of the quality of the project.

(2) Issues Regarding Industrial Production

The first five-year plan of our country stipulates that the total industrial output value will increase by 98.3%, that is, an average annual increase of 14.7%. This speed is lower than the recovery period but is high under the conditions of the first five-year plan and is of an active nature.

The situation of the construction period and the recovery period is different, and the speed of industrial production growth in the construction period is lower than the speed of industrial production growth in the recovery period, which is natural. The reason is: the restoration of production of old enterprises is relatively easy, while the construction of new enterprises and the use of new technology are relatively difficult, and moreover, the base number of industrial output value increases year by year. Although this is the case, based on the production potential of the existing industrial equipment of our country, the speed of industrial production growth in five years is possible to be higher. If we strive to overcome difficulties, then we will not only be able to complete the plan but also have the possibility to overfulfill the plan.

The completion of the industrial production plan in five years mainly relies on the existing enterprises of our country. According to the overall calculation of the total industrial output value of the country, in 1957, compared to 1952, the newly increased output value accounts for about 70% of the existing enterprises, and the newly increased output value of new and major reconstructed enterprises accounts for only about 30%. Existing enterprises, in addition to supplying new enterprises with equipment and materials and meeting the daily necessities needed by the people, also undertake the important tasks of accumulating funds for the state and cultivating cadres. Therefore, in addition to the fact that new and expanded enterprises should strive to enter production as early as possible under the premise of ensuring the quality of the project, it is necessary to attach importance to the production work of existing enterprises, to fully tap the potential of existing enterprises, and to strive to overfulfill the production plan. Some departments and some places only focus on the construction of new factories and mines, do not pay attention to utilizing the existing factories and mines, and do not try to tap the production capacity of the existing factories and mines. This is obviously wrong and must be corrected.

The local industry and handicrafts of our country play an important role in supplying the production and living needs of urban and rural people. In the past few years, due to the shortcomings in planning work and other reasons, some industries of local industry have experienced the problem of blind development, which has increased some difficulties in the arrangement of national industrial production. But in general, the active development of local industry is correct. In the future, we should adapt to the requirements of the national plan, implement the policy of serving agricultural production, continue to correctly play the role of local industry, and play the role of handicrafts. Some departments and some places underestimate the role of local industry and handicrafts in the national economy, and therefore do not actively and plannedly lead and help the development of local industry and handicrafts, which is obviously wrong and must be corrected.

The completion and overfulfillment of the industrial production indicators stipulated in the five-year plan are of decisive significance: increasing and saving industrial raw materials, trial-manufacturing new types of products, and improving the level of enterprise management work. I will now explain the following three issues.

First, the issue of increasing and saving industrial raw materials.

One difficulty in increasing the output of industrial products in five years is the insufficient industrial raw materials. I mentioned this point when I talked about the issue of the proportion of investment in heavy and light industry. The so-called insufficient raw materials are first of all the insufficient industrial raw materials of agricultural products, which are cotton, hemp, oil crops, tobacco leaves, sugarcane, etc., the growth in the quantity of which will temporarily still be lower than the requirements of industrial production growth. Secondly, it is the insufficient raw materials from heavy industry, some of which have low output, and some of which cannot be produced domestically at present. Of course, some raw materials can be imported, but due to the insufficient increase in agricultural products or the excessive domestic consumption, the export quantity of local products is insufficient, reducing foreign exchange earnings, and thus also reducing the import of industrial raw materials.

To overcome the difficulty of insufficient industrial raw materials, we must increase the output of industrial raw materials such as cotton, hemp, oil crops, tobacco leaves, sugarcane, sugar beets, peanuts, sesame, and rapeseed. The five-year plan stipulates the indicators for expanding the sowing area of the above various technical crops, which must be guaranteed to be completed and strive to be overfulfilled. At the same time, the unit area yield of these technical crops must be increased as much as possible. Taking cotton as an example, it is possible to expand the sowing area by more than 11 million mu in five years, and because the main production areas are mostly old liberated areas, as long as special attention is paid to the work of organizing agricultural production cooperatives in these areas, and the state provides as much assistance as possible to cotton farmers, it is still possible to increase the unit area yield. Taking tobacco leaves and sugarcane as examples, it is also possible to expand the sowing area of tobacco leaves by more than 10 million mu and the sowing area of sugarcane by more than 10 million mu in five years. We should try to expand the sowing area of grain as much as possible, and at the same time, we should strive to increase the sowing area of technical crops under the condition of not affecting the increase in grain production. Increasing the sowing area of 50 million mu of tobacco leaves can increase the production of 50 million boxes of cigarettes; increasing the sowing area of 40 million mu of sugarcane can increase the production of 10 million tons of sugar. Taking oil crops as an example, if the vast majority of farmers make the most of the idle land to start planting, the plan to expand the sowing area by more than 320 million mu in five years is not only possible to complete but also possible to exceed.

We must increase the output of export local products to exchange foreign exchange and increase the import of industrial raw materials necessary for production. As long as local governments and farmers across the country pay attention to this, the increase in the output of export local products is completely possible.

In the issue of industrial raw materials, in addition to actively increasing production, we must use raw materials economically and overcome waste. If each piece of cotton yarn uses two jin less of cotton on average, the country can increase the production of at least 2 million pieces of cotton yarn per year. According to the materials we recently obtained, in the first quarter of 1955, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in public and private textile mills in Shanghai was reduced to 386.1 jin, which is nearly 7 jin less than the planned cotton consumption per piece of yarn for the country in the first half of 1955. Among them, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in state-owned cotton textile mills is 384.98 jin, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in joint state-private cotton textile mills is 386.65 jin, and the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in private cotton textile mills is 387.42 jin. This advanced experience of saving cotton should be seriously promoted in various places. Again, as long as each 100 jin of oil crops produces one jin more of oil on average, the country can increase the production of at least 1 billion jin of edible oil per year. The "Soybean Oil Pressing Operation Method" of Li Chuanjiang in Siping City, Jilin Province, increased the oil yield per 100 jin of soybeans to 13.5 jin in 1954, which is about 2 jin more than the average oil yield per 100 jin of soybeans in the country; the oil pressing workshop where Li Chuanjiang is located increased the oil yield per 100 jin of soybeans to more than 14 jin in the first quarter of 1955. This advanced operating method should be seriously studied and promoted in all places. For some industrial products with insufficient raw materials, we should also actively study some substitute materials, expand the sources of raw materials, and increase production.

Many products, such as coal, phosphate fertilizer, and salt, still have the potential to increase production. As long as we organize and provide the necessary investment, then increasing production is completely possible.

Second, the issue of trial-manufacturing new types of products.

Another difficulty in increasing the output of industrial products in five years is that some enterprises, due to low technical level, can only manufacture products that do not meet the needs, while the products that have a market cannot be manufactured for the time being.

Some urgently needed things cannot be manufactured for the time being, which is an inevitable phenomenon in the progress of our industry. The mechanical industry department of the state is trying to improve this. However, the phenomenon of too few new products is not unique to the mechanical industry department. What should be examined is whether the various levels of leadership departments have made the necessary efforts for the manufacture of new products? Have all aspects of the country, first of all, the various industrial departments, regarded this work as a common work and made joint efforts? We believe that our efforts are not enough. We must concentrate all possible forces, design new products, trial-manufacture new products, and give full enthusiasm to assist the trial manufacture of new products. Some industrial products needed in the market, such as some metal products, some mechanical products, some chemical industry products, some medical equipment, we not only have raw materials but also have the ability to manufacture them ourselves, just because we have not organized production, so they have not been manufactured. Therefore, enterprise management agencies must constantly understand the needs of national construction and the market, and manufacture products that meet the needs of national construction and the market.

It must be understood that the significance of the trial manufacture of new products is not only limited to improving the current industrial production but more importantly, it is a necessary way to improve the technical level of our industry, and improving the technical level of industry is a basic condition for completing the task of socialist industrialization.

The economic work departments of the state should establish leadership organs for the research and trial manufacture of new types of products, so as to systematically understand and collect the production situation of new types of products of production materials and living materials at home and abroad, strengthen the planning, design, experimentation, and manufacturing work of new types of products, continuously summarize the experience of the trial manufacture of new types of products, regularly check the trial manufacture plan of new types of products, and ensure the implementation of the plan. The state should formulate measures to reward public and private enterprises and handicrafts for manufacturing new types of products, reward the inventions and creations of scientists, technical personnel, and the masses of workers, and encourage public and private enterprises to pay attention to utilizing their inventions and creations and carry out the trial manufacturing work. Seriously paying attention to the emergence of new things and giving them enthusiastic help is the responsibility of our country's workers. Those who do not value new things and lose their sense of new things should be criticized.

An important key to increasing new types of products and industrial product output is to strengthen the cooperation within enterprises, between various enterprises, and between various industrial departments. Industrial production is interrelated and requires mutual cooperation. Only by cooperating can we produce and increase production. The scattered and uncoordinated industrial equipment of our country requires us to cooperate more broadly, so that the specialization of enterprises and the cooperation of enterprise production can be further combined, thoroughly changing the idea and practice of only producing within one's own enterprise or department. Not only should the various workshops or sections within an enterprise cooperate in production, but the various enterprises within a department should also cooperate in production, and moreover, various departments should also cooperate in production. To be able to cooperate well, each workshop or section, each enterprise, and each department should establish an overall perspective, overcome local perspectives. Major cooperation projects between enterprises and between departments should be listed in the production plans of the state and departments respectively; at the same time, the contract between enterprises and the contract between various workshops within an enterprise should be universally promoted, so that industrial departments and various enterprise units can cooperate and connect well in production, improve the organizational level of industry.

Third, the issue of improving the level of enterprise management work.

In the past few years, the management work of our enterprises has improved significantly, and as a result, the production tasks have been overfulfilled every year nationwide. However, many enterprises have not completed the plan, some have not completed the output value indicators; some have only completed the output value indicators but have not completed the indicators of product categories and quality; some have completed the output and quality indicators but have not completed the indicators of increasing labor productivity and reducing costs. Many enterprises have the phenomena of being loose and tight and being loose in the beginning and tight in the end when executing the plan, and the production is very uneven, increasing the chaos in production. Many enterprises still frequently have accidents and equipment accidents, causing losses. Due to the shortcomings and low level of enterprise management work, phenomena such as fewer varieties, lower quality, and higher costs still exist quite commonly in industrial products. Therefore, all industrial enterprises must, according to the sixth item of the necessary measures for realizing the industrial production plan in Chapter 3 of the five-year plan draft, continuously improve the level of enterprise management, especially strengthen technical management and the cost accounting system, and strengthen political work within the enterprise, so that political work and economic work are combined, improve the political awareness of the broad masses of workers and staff, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and improve labor productivity.

We should see that the completion of the industrial production plan is facing some difficulties, and the attitude of not caring about completing the industrial production indicators and thinking that there is "no problem" is wrong. However, as long as the people of the whole country make joint efforts, increasing industrial production and improving the quality of industrial products, completing and overfulfilling the plan indicator of increasing the industrial production value by 98.3% in five years is completely possible. The mood of fearing difficulties and losing confidence is also wrong.

(3) Issues Regarding Agricultural Increase

Agricultural production supplies food for the people of the whole country. At present, the output value of industrial products using agricultural products as raw materials still accounts for more than 50% of the total industrial output value of the country, and most of the foreign exchange needed for the import of industrial equipment and construction materials is also obtained from the export of agricultural products. Therefore, developing agriculture is a basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan. We concentrate our efforts on developing industry, but we must not reduce the significance of developing agriculture. Without the corresponding development of agriculture, our industrialization cause cannot be realized. Preventing and overcoming the contradiction that agricultural development lags far behind industrial development is a major and urgent task for us in building a socialist society.

The first five-year plan stipulates that the total output value of agriculture and its sideline occupations will increase by 23.3% in five years, reaching 59.66 billion yuan in 1957; in terms of output, grain will increase by 17.6%, that is, an increase of 57.8 billion jin, reaching 385.6 billion jin in 1957, and cotton will increase by 25.4%, that is, an increase of 6.6 million dan, reaching 32.7 million dan in 1957. Although the above indicators have been reduced compared to the originally planned ones, because they are based on the bumper harvest of agricultural products in 1952, they are still very high; moreover, because the agricultural production in 1953 and 1954 did not complete the originally planned increase due to disasters, it increased the increase task of the last three years of the five-year plan. Therefore, to achieve the above indicators, we must make great efforts.

Now I will talk about the three issues of agricultural collectivization, agricultural increase measures, and leadership of agricultural production.

First, the issue of agricultural collectivization.

During the first five-year plan period, we must actively and step-by-step, on the basis of the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, rely on the poor peasants (including all those who were originally poor peasants and became new middle peasants), firmly unite the middle peasants, and organize agricultural production cooperatives. This is an agricultural production cooperative with the characteristics of stocking land and unified management. That is to say, this is still a cooperative with partial collective ownership and semi-socialist nature. However, such initial collectivization organizes the scattered small-scale peasant economy into a joint operation of dozens of households, which can reasonably organize labor and use land, can accumulate funds to increase agricultural investment, use improved tools, build water conservancy projects, improve cultivation techniques, and implement various other increase measures that individual peasants find difficult to carry out alone. According to the materials from various places, agricultural production cooperatives can generally increase production by 10% to 20% in the first one or two years of establishment, and can maintain a certain increase ratio every year in the future, which is higher than mutual aid teams and much higher than the increase rate of individual peasant economy. According to the current situation, this is a way of increasing agricultural production with less investment, greater returns, and quicker results, and it is also a necessary step to guide peasants to socialism. Through such initial forms of collectivization, combined with initial technical improvement, and then gradually transitioning to higher forms of collectivization, combined with agricultural mechanization and other technical reforms, this is the path for the continuous progress of agricultural production in our country.

Based on the experience of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past few years and the achievements reached by various places, the first five-year plan stipulates that the proportion of peasant households participating in the existing primary form of agricultural production cooperatives in the total number of peasant households in the country will reach about one-third. Among them, the scale of collectivization in Northeast China and the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other old liberated areas will reach about half of the peasant households. In technical crop areas and suburban areas of cities, efforts will be made to achieve collectivization first. This agricultural collectivization plan is possible to realize, and we must strive to realize it. The state will fully support the development of agricultural production cooperatives in terms of financial and material resources.

Our agricultural cooperation movement has achieved great success. The agricultural production cooperatives organized in the past few years are more than 90% consolidated, and among them, the vast majority have significantly increased their output. But in some places, there are also a few agricultural production cooperatives that, due to the hasty and rough work, have the tendency of coercion and other shortcomings. If these problems are not corrected, not only will they not increase production, but they may even reduce production. We must adhere to the policy of active leadership and steady progress in agricultural production cooperatives, consolidating while developing. In the work, we must resolutely adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit of the masses, prevent and correct the practice of coercion, and behaviors that harm the interests of middle peasants, and properly solve various problems within agricultural production cooperatives, such as the calculation of labor, the remuneration of land and other means of production, the collection of production funds, the proportion of public accumulation funds, etc.

While striving to develop agricultural production cooperatives, we must continue to develop and improve various specific forms of agricultural labor mutual aid organizations to prepare conditions for the development of agricultural production cooperatives; we must continue to pay attention to and lead the production enthusiasm of individual peasant households, give active help and leadership to individual peasant households, tap their potential production power, and improve the unit area yield.

Second, the issue of agricultural increase measures, the fourth chapter of the five-year plan draft has already written in detail, now I propose the following points:

First, open up wasteland suitable for cultivation. Our country has a large population, but the cultivated land is still very little, and we must actively and plannedly open up the land suitable for cultivation to fundamentally overcome the shortage of agricultural production. The five-year plan stipulates the expansion of cultivated land area by 38.68 million mu, which is the minimum indicator, and we must try to exceed this number by various means. The opening of wasteland has three methods: one method is for state-owned farms to open up wasteland, all existing state-owned farms should, according to the possible conditions of the locality, appropriately expand the cultivated land area, and at the same time, in areas with more wasteland suitable for cultivation, new state-owned farms should be built in a planned way to open up wasteland; another method is to use machinery and other methods to open up wasteland, and to organize the migration of people to cultivate, this method is complex in work and large in scale, and the state should work with various localities to formulate specific plans and carry out them in a planned way; another method is for farmers to open up wasteland locally, this method is relatively easy to carry out and small in scale, and it can be led by local state organs to carry out. Whether it is state-owned farms opening up wasteland, migrant opening up wasteland, or farmers opening up wasteland locally, in the next three years, all should be actively implemented as an important method of increase. The funds saved by the state from reducing non-productive construction expenditures and administrative expenses will be used to a considerable extent for the opening of wasteland.

In the next three years, we will continue to build the Kangding-Qamdo Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which were started in 1954 and have a total length of more than 4,300 kilometers. These highways are opened up in sparsely populated areas at an altitude of several thousand meters, and the construction projects are particularly arduous. In the next three years, we will continue to build the Huai River comprehensive treatment project. It is planned to build four large reservoirs, Nanwan, Boshan, Foziling, and Meishan, with a total capacity of more than 38 billion cubic meters; at the same time, flood control and drainage projects will be carried out on major tributaries such as the Hong River, Yu River, Si River, and Bei River. The Guanting Reservoir, which was completed in 1954, can store 23 billion cubic meters of water and will play a major role in preventing water disasters in the lower reaches of the Yongding River.

In the next three years, we will begin the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River. The Yellow River is more than 4,800 kilometers long, flows through seven provinces, and has a drainage area of 745,000 square kilometers. It has always been the most severely affected river in our country's history. According to the comprehensive utilization plan of the Yellow River, dozens of dams will be built in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and its major tributaries, and giant water storage and hydroelectric power stations will be built in five places such as Sanmenxia to regulate the flow. During the first five-year plan period, the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River will complete the river basin planning and begin the construction of the water conservancy and hydroelectric hub project at Sanmenxia.

The state-owned Friendship Farm, built with direct help from the Soviet Union, will cultivate 375,000 mu of wasteland. This farm is equipped with a large number of modern mechanical equipment donated by the Soviet Union and will play an important role in demonstrating and leading the mechanization of agriculture in our country in the future.

With the direct help of the Soviet Union, our country will begin the construction of peaceful use of atomic energy in five years, making it serve the national economy.

Title: On the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 6th.

During the first five-year plan period, we should actively conduct surveys and prospecting of wasteland suitable for cultivation, complete the prospecting of over 100 million mu of wasteland, and at least complete the planning and design of 40 to 50 million mu of wasteland reclamation, to prepare for large-scale wasteland reclamation in the second five-year plan.

Second, water conservancy projects. Water conservancy construction can both expand the area of irrigation and promote the increase of agricultural production, and can also prevent water and drought disasters and avoid the reduction of agricultural production. Many water conservancy facilities, as long as they have a few years of increased production or disaster reduction benefits, can offset the investment in water conservancy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have vigorously carried out water conservancy construction. The newly built large water conservancy projects have played a huge role in the fight against water and drought disasters, especially the floods in 1954. During the first five-year plan period, in addition to the large water conservancy projects built by the state, small-scale farmland water conservancy, such as projects benefiting a few dozen to a few hundred mu, should also be carried out on a large scale according to the actual needs and possible conditions of each place. Because these projects are scattered, construction is relatively easy, and agricultural production cooperatives and the masses of farmers can be organized to carry them out in parts; when necessary, the state will provide financial and material assistance.

Third, fully and effectively utilize the land. The characteristic of our country's large population makes it necessary and possible for us to fully utilize the land. In addition to reclaiming wasteland and increasing the area of irrigation, soil improvement work should be carried out, such as turning saline-alkali land and sandy land into fertile fields, turning hilly land into terraced fields, and turning dry land into paddy fields. In the possible conditions of climate, rainfall, terrain, and other natural conditions, and fertilizer, water conservancy, labor, and animal power and other economic conditions, the multiple cropping index of cultivated land should be appropriately increased. In mountainous areas, unified planning should be carried out to combine the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and rural sideline industries, develop diversified economy, and strengthen soil and water conservation. Farmers should be encouraged to further refine cultivation, improve fertilizer, and gradually promote advanced planting methods suitable for the local area, such as planting more water-tolerant crops in low-lying areas, more early-maturing crops and increasing the planting of winter crops in autumn waterlogging areas. Some of the above aspects have already achieved initial experience in some provinces, and these experiences should be summarized and promoted in various places in a way that suits local conditions. The effective production experiences of the masses in various places should also be actively and gradually promoted.

Various technical crops should be actively and gradually expanded in suitable areas to hilly and mountainous areas, avoiding increasing the sowing area of technical crops while reducing the sowing area of grain crops as much as possible.

Fourth, increase the sowing area of high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and tuber crops. The unit yield of rice is nearly twice as high as that of wheat, the unit yield of corn can be increased by 50% compared to other coarse grains, and tuber crops such as sweet potatoes and potatoes have a yield several times higher than that of general coarse grains (in terms of use, 2.5 catties of tuber crops can replace 1 catty of grain). There is no doubt that expanding the sowing area of these high-yield crops will have an important role in alleviating the tension of grain and feed in our country. In the national coarse grain production areas and other suitable areas, if a few thousand mu of grain fields are converted to tuber crops, although the annual grain production will be reduced by a few billion catties, it will be possible to increase the production of tuber crops by more than 100 billion catties to more than 200 billion catties. Therefore, in the coarse grain production areas and areas suitable for the growth of tuber crops, local state organs should study and plan the issue of expanding the sowing area of tuber crops and other high-yield crops, and actively implement them. Agricultural departments and scientific research institutions should seriously study and cultivate excellent varieties of tuber crops, study the prevention and treatment of rot, improvement of storage and processing methods.

Fifth, the use of new plows, double-wheel double-share plows, and double-wheel single-share plows, the active accumulation of fertilizer and the reasonable application of fertilizer, the promotion of excellent varieties, the elimination of crop diseases and pests, etc., are all effective measures to increase crop yields, and should be implemented in a way that suits local conditions. Various levels of state organs should strengthen the work of issuing agricultural loans, strengthen the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools, strengthen the work of technical promotion stations, tractor stations, and water pump stations, strengthen the demonstration role of state farms, carry out agricultural technology improvement and seed improvement experiments among farmers, and organize training classes for farmers on these experiments and promotions, so that the state's assistance to farmers can be combined with the production increase measures taken by the broad masses of farmers.

Third, the leadership of agricultural production.

The development of agricultural production requires not only unified leadership in terms of policies, principles, and steps at the national level, but more importantly, it requires the initiative of local areas, strengthening the leadership of local party and government organs over agriculture, and adopting effective production increase measures in combination with local specific conditions. Each province must concentrate sufficient strength on leading agricultural production increase. County, district, township, and village should, without exception, take leading agricultural production and agricultural mutual aid cooperation as the focus of their work.

Local party and government organs at all levels should, based on the specific conditions and actual experience of their local areas, formulate a five-year plan for agricultural production increase, and implement the various policies of the party and the state regarding rural work and agricultural production increase, raise the production enthusiasm of the masses of farmers, and ensure the realization of this plan. The local agricultural production increase plan should adapt to the requirements of the national plan, based on the possible conditions of the local area, formulate an index for over-fulfilling the national plan, so that the national plan has a more reliable foundation. At the same time, the local agricultural production increase plan should also take into account the specific needs of the local masses, so that agricultural production can meet the diverse needs of farmers and stimulate and give full play to the enthusiasm of farmers for management.

Some local state organs and cadres in rural areas have not concentrated their efforts on leading agricultural production, and have not seriously studied effective production increase or disaster prevention measures, and mobilized the masses to implement production increase or disaster prevention measures, resulting in the leadership of agricultural production being in a state of laissez-faire. Some, when promoting various advanced experiences and measures for production increase, do not base them on the specific conditions of the local area, but rather do so in a uniform manner, regardless of the effect. Some, when developing agricultural cooperatives, do not patiently persuade and educate the farmers and adopt the method of typical demonstration, but violate the principle of voluntarism and implement compulsory orders. All these shortcomings in rural work must be corrected.

Here, I would like to specially talk about the issue of developing animal husbandry. The development of animal husbandry can increase the draught animals and fertilizers needed for agricultural production, increase the raw materials needed for light industry such as leather and fur, increase the supply of meat in the market, and increase the income of farmers and herdsmen. Therefore, in all agricultural areas and pastoral areas, the various measures regarding the development of animal husbandry stipulated in Chapter 4 of the five-year plan should be earnestly implemented, to promote the rapid reproduction of livestock, and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the five-year plan's targets for increasing the number of horses, cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, pigs, and other livestock. The state organs should, in terms of finance and technology, provide as much assistance as possible to the development of animal husbandry in ethnic minority areas, and strengthen the leadership of work in pastoral areas.

(Four) On the issue of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce

Now I want to talk about some issues in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state, that is, the issue of the steps of transformation, the issue of the deployment of the transformation of capitalist industry, the issue of the deployment of the transformation of capitalist commerce, and the issue of capitalists must abide by state laws and accept transformation.

First, the issue of the steps of transformation.

At present, there is still a large amount of complex private industry and commerce in our country. In terms of industry, by 1953, the number of employees in private industry (excluding individual handicrafts) was more than two million, of which there were more than 45,000 capitalist industrial enterprises with more than ten employees, employing more than 1.5 million workers. In terms of commerce, by 1953, the number of employees in the national capitalist wholesale trade was nearly 200,000, the number of employees in the national capitalist retail trade was about 2 million, and there were still several million small traders. Among the employees in the above private industry and commerce, there is a considerable number of capitalists. For such a large and complex private industry and commerce, to completely implement socialist transformation is a very arduous task.

For the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, we should distinguish between capitalist nature and independent laborer nature, and adopt appropriate steps and flexible forms accordingly.

The state's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is realized in two steps, the first step is to transform capitalism into state capitalism, and the second step is to transform state capitalism into socialism.

State capitalism is a transitional form of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that it is necessary to encourage and guide capitalist industry and commerce to "transform into various different forms of state capitalist economy, and gradually replace capitalist ownership with public ownership." This means that during the transition period, we will gradually eliminate the capitalist exploitation system, not by realizing it all at once, but by gradually realizing it through various different forms of state capitalism. We will allow capitalists to have a necessary period of time to gradually accept the transformation under the leadership of the state and the working class through the transitional form of state capitalism.

State capitalism has various different forms. The highest form is joint state-private ownership; the middle and low forms are, in industry, processing and ordering, and in commerce, agency buying, agency selling, and consignment selling.

In the past few years, our work of transforming capitalism has generally been from low-level, middle-level forms to high-level forms, from major industries to minor industries, and from large cities to medium and small cities. This systematic and steady approach has been proven to be relatively appropriate, and we will continue to promote this approach.

Several years of experience have shown that after transforming the capitalist economy into a state capitalist economy, there have been different degrees of changes in nature, that is, to different degrees, the socialist factor has been added, which limits the anarchic production and operation of capitalism and the activities of capitalists seeking profit, and makes this part of the economy to different degrees enter the orbit of national planning. At the same time, due to the change in the position of workers in production, labor enthusiasm has been improved, thereby improving the labor productivity of enterprises and improving management, and making it possible to properly handle labor-management relations within the enterprise. From this, it can be seen that under the conditions of our country, adopting the transitional form of state capitalism to gradually transform capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually overcome the contradiction between capitalist production relations and the growth of productive forces, and thereby facilitate the gradual replacement of capitalist ownership with public ownership, is necessary and feasible.

The state's transformation of private industry and commerce of an independent laborer nature is carried out according to the different situations of various industries, based on the principle of voluntarism, and gradually organizes them through various forms of cooperation, from various low-level forms of cooperation, gradually transitioning to higher-level forms of cooperation, so that they can effectively serve the needs of the state and society.

During the first five-year plan period, it is estimated that the transformation of private industry and commerce will achieve the following results, that is, most of the private industry will be transformed into various forms of state capitalism, and most of the modern private industry will be transformed into the high form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership; more than half of the private commerce will be transformed into various forms of state capitalist commerce and cooperative forms of small commerce organized by small traders.

Second, the issue of the deployment of the transformation of capitalist industry.

For state-owned industry, cooperative industry, joint state-private industry, and private industry, in the distribution of production tasks, the distribution of raw materials, and the procurement of products, the principle of comprehensive balancing as stipulated by the state must be implemented. On the one hand, the development of socialist industry is given priority, while non-socialist economic components do not have this priority, and there are differences between them in this regard; on the other hand, the role of private industry in our country's transition period should be appropriately taken into account, and in some aspects, especially for the workers and employees of joint state-private enterprises, they should be treated equally.

During the period of national economic recovery, the state, in order to adjust private industry and commerce, had already implemented processing and ordering for some private factories (firstly cotton mills). This policy had a great effect on the arrangement of private industrial production. Since 1953, when the state began planned construction, in order to strengthen the planned nature of production, for many important raw materials, some were almost entirely procured by the state, and some were largely procured by the state. These procured raw materials were all distributed by the state. At this time, the state had already implemented processing and ordering, unified procurement and marketing for most of the products of private industry, making this type of private industry into middle-level and initial-level state capitalist industry. In this process, due to the increase in the amount of processing and ordering during the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the beginning of large-scale construction in 1953, and the lack of foresight in the commercial sector in the work of processing and ordering, many industries in the country, including state-owned and private enterprises, had blindly expanded their equipment. After the amount of processing and ordering for some products was relatively reduced in 1954, some industries experienced insufficient production tasks and insufficient operation. At the same time, in industries with insufficient operation, there was a period when the distribution of raw materials and production tasks for public and private enterprises was not appropriate, that is, public and private joint enterprises and private enterprises received less, resulting in some industries in private enterprises encountering greater difficulties. This situation has been somewhat improved.

According to the state's principle of comprehensive balancing, the production of public and private industries is being uniformly arranged. The distribution of raw materials and orders for national industry will, when necessary, receive more, but at the same time, it is necessary to appropriately take into account public and private joint enterprises and private enterprises, so that they can maintain production. Because only by maintaining the production of private enterprises can it be beneficial to consolidate the unity and solidarity of the working class, and also beneficial to maintain the necessary economic alliance between the working class and the bourgeoisie during the transition period, and at the same time beneficial to the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The central industrial departments should include the production capacity of private industry in the formulation of industrial production plans, incorporate it into the plan, and make reasonable use of it. At the same time, the central and local governments will establish specialized agencies to jointly manage the business of public and private joint enterprises and private factories with the relevant industrial departments.

According to the principle of comprehensive balancing, the state adopts the method of arranging private industry in a row-by-row and industry-by-industry manner and comprehensively within the original industry. This method is not to arrange only a few factories in an industry, but to comprehensively arrange all private factories in this industry. For example: for those with conditions to implement joint state-private ownership, joint state-private ownership should be carried out; for those that currently do not have the conditions for joint ownership, processing and ordering should be carried out as much as possible, or the state should procure their products; for medium and small factories that need and can be merged, capitalists should be encouraged to adopt the method of "big leading small" to gradually merge, creating conditions for accepting joint state-private ownership; for those factories that truly have no transformation conditions and must be eliminated, they should be helped to arrange workers and eliminate enterprises. With the above arrangements, joint state-private ownership should be gradually developed.

We should actively implement joint state-private ownership for private industry, but we must also proceed steadily and prevent rash advances. All necessary preparations must be made so that after the joint ownership, the level of production management can be improved, and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility and production decline can be prevented.

In profitable private enterprises, profits should be appropriately obtained by capitalists according to the law; in joint state-private enterprises, private shares should also obtain the benefits stipulated by the law. But at the same time, those capitalists who seriously commit bribery, shoddy work, theft of state property, tax evasion, and theft of state economic intelligence, known as the "five poisons," and those capitalists who resist state leadership, sabotage the unity of the working class, and sabotage the enterprise, should be given the punishment they deserve.

Third, the issue of the deployment of the transformation of capitalist commerce.

Private commerce can be divided into two categories: one is wholesale commerce, and the other is retail commerce. We should adopt the following methods to deal with these two types of private merchants.

Most of the original wholesale merchants were capitalists who had more capital and employed more workers. If the wholesale merchants control the market's goods, they will inevitably seek profit and engage in various speculative hoarding activities, which will be harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the state-owned commerce must control the wholesale business of major commodities. From 1950 to the first half of 1953, the state gradually reduced the business of wholesale merchants by procuring major agricultural products and processing and ordering a large number of industrial products. From the second half of 1953 to now, the state has implemented unified procurement and marketing for grain, oil, cotton, and cloth, and for most industrial products, from the factory to retail, generally does not allow wholesale merchants to control the goods. In this way, many commodities in short supply have avoided the speculative hoarding of wholesale merchants. The state has either allowed those wholesale merchants who no longer have goods to engage in secondary wholesale or has recruited their employees by the state-owned commercial department. Some commodities that the state does not operate or only operates a part of, continue to be operated by wholesale merchants. The state will gradually transform this part of wholesale merchants who can still operate into state capitalist wholesale merchants.

Most of the retail merchants are small traders and small vendors, in addition to shop assistants and small traders who do not employ shop assistants, there are also some handicraftsmen who sell their products, and some people in the catering and service industries. The business of retail merchants has undergone great changes in recent years compared to before liberation. Since the state implemented processing and ordering, unified procurement and marketing for most industrial products, and the procurement of major agricultural products by cooperatives, most of the retail merchants, whether they are seated merchants or street vendors, their sources of goods can only rely on state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce for wholesale, so their business is generally for state-owned and cooperative commerce to act as agents and consignors.

In the socialist transformation of commerce, since the winter of 1953, due to the fact that the retail business volume of some state-owned commerce, especially cooperative commerce, has increased too fast, the retail business volume of private retail merchants has decreased too much. Now this has been adjusted. The state, in order to maintain private retail merchants, maintain urban and rural small vendors, whether in cities or towns, for those state-owned and cooperative commerce retail volumes that have increased too much, have temporarily stopped advancing or appropriately retreated; in towns, cooperative business has also appropriately reduced retail and done more wholesale, and organized small vendors through agency selling and consignment selling. At the same time, each city and town will, according to the local situation, set a public-private ratio for retail volume that can stabilize market prices and maintain private business, and try to stabilize this public-private ratio for a period of time, so that it is possible to appropriately arrange the employees of private commerce and facilitate the socialist transformation of private commerce row by row and industry by industry.

Fourth, the issue of capitalists must abide by state laws and accept transformation.

In the process of socialist transformation, it is difficult to completely avoid some difficulties in production and operation for private industry and commerce. Under the principle of comprehensive balancing and the overall arrangement of private industry and commerce by the state, capitalists should strive to overcome difficulties, obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, abide by the state plan, actively rectify enterprises, improve management, and prepare conditions to accept socialist transformation.

In recent years, a group of capitalists who can love the country and abide by the law, take an active attitude towards accepting socialist transformation, and play a leading role have emerged among industrial and commercial capitalists. The state welcomes and values these people. But on the other hand, some capitalists still take a negative attitude towards socialist transformation, and some of them are still committing the "five poisons" activities prohibited by the Constitution, such as endangering public interests, disrupting the social economic order, and sabotaging the state economic plan, using more cunning methods to commit the "five poisons"; some even resist or sabotage socialist transformation. Such people should be criticized by public opinion and punished by law.

The various complex forms adopted for the socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises are the result of the special historical conditions of the special form of class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie in the transition period. At the same time, it must be seen that this is also a special form of class struggle. The idea that socialist transformation can be achieved without struggle is not in accordance with the historical development of society and actual conditions, and is therefore completely wrong. We, according to the Constitution, protect the ownership of production materials and other capital ownership of capitalists by law during the transition period, and allow law-abiding capitalists to obtain the profits stipulated by the law within a certain period of time; at the same time, for those capitalists who violate the law, they must be given the punishment they deserve. Small retail merchants who do not employ workers, although they are self-employed, we should unite them, but they participate in the labor of commodity circulation, and at the same time, they are owners, so they can easily become speculators. Therefore, the socialist transformation of them must also go through a certain degree and a certain form of struggle.

Several years of experience have shown that the transformation of capitalist enterprises needs to be carried out in conjunction with the transformation of the thoughts of capitalists. We encourage capitalists to study the general tasks of the state in the transition period and various policies, strive to transform themselves, abide by state laws, and actively support the cause of socialist transformation by the state.

(Five) On the issue of ensuring market stability

Ensuring market stability is a necessary condition for the completion of the first five-year plan.

The first five-year plan draft stipulates the following measures to ensure market stability:

1. Continue to maintain the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and increase fiscal and material reserves;
2. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, correspondingly develop the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign areas, and expand the circulation of commodities;
3. For some major industrial and agricultural products that are in short supply, gradually implement the policy of planned procurement and planned supply on the basis of increasing production.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the market prices were stabilized in a short period of time, specifically in early 1950. This is related to the measures such as the balance of state fiscal revenue and expenditure and the state's control of huge material reserves. Because the state fiscal revenue and expenditure are balanced, it is possible to stabilize the currency value, and thus stabilize the prices. Because the state has huge material reserves, it is possible to supply the materials needed by the market, and thus fight against the hoarding and speculation of private merchants. This market stability is a major achievement in the period of economic recovery in our country. This achievement has played a significant role in the rapid recovery of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives. There is no doubt that we must continue to consolidate this achievement in the period of planned economic construction.

Developing the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign areas, expanding commodity circulation, promoting the development of production and economic prosperity, and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, is an important economic policy of our country. The first five-year plan must strive to increase production and open up sources of goods to continue to implement this policy. According to the five-year plan, the public and private commerce will have different degrees of growth in the sale of various major commodities for the daily consumption of the people. For several major daily necessities, by 1957 compared to 1952, there will be the following growth rates: grain will increase by 13.3%, pork will increase by 57%, edible vegetable oil will increase by 65.9%, aquatic products will increase by 70.1%, salt will increase by 34.3%, sugar will increase by 122.9%, cotton cloth will increase by 55.1%, knitted goods will increase by 105.3%, rubber shoes will increase by 69.8%, kerosene will increase by 143.5%, machine-made paper will increase by 89.2%, and cigarettes will increase by 87%. These growth rates of several major daily necessities are not low by usual standards, and China has never had such high growth rates in such a short period of time in history.

However, due to the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the rapid increase in people's purchasing power, and the fact that many industrial enterprises invested in by the state need to go through a period of time to increase the quantity of commodities more, and the current slow progress of agricultural raw material production is inevitable, it will make some light industrial products face considerable restrictions in large-scale production. Therefore, for a considerable period of time, the growth rate of people's purchasing power will exceed the growth rate of consumer goods production, and the growth rate of purchasing power in rural areas will be even faster than that in urban areas. The phenomenon of many commodities being in short supply is difficult to avoid for a period of time.

At the first session of the First National People's Congress held in 1954, Comrade Chen Yun's speech detailed the fundamental reasons for the shortage of grain, oil, meat, and cloth and other consumer goods, which is because the growth rate of people's purchasing power exceeds the growth rate of the production of these consumer goods, not because of the reduction of consumer goods production, or because of too much export, as some people suspected.

We believe that the phenomenon of some consumer goods being in short supply in the market should not be allowed to develop freely, and effective measures should be taken to gradually solve this problem.

The increase in the supply of people's consumer goods can only be gradually realized on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, solving the problem of the shortage of some consumer goods, the fundamental way is to develop industrial and agricultural production, which is the task of the people of the whole country, especially the workers and peasants.

In order to continue to maintain market stability, in addition to striving to increase production, the state must, according to the different production situations of major commodities, gradually promote the policy of planned procurement and planned supply, so as to have planned control over the sources of goods and organize supply, severely fight against speculators, and not allow private merchants to manipulate the market.

The state began to implement the planned procurement and planned supply of grain in November 1953, and subsequently implemented the planned procurement and planned supply of edible vegetable oil; in September 1954, the planned procurement of cotton and the planned procurement and planned supply of cotton cloth were also implemented. In these two years, the state also expanded the processing and ordering and procurement and marketing of industrial products, and expanded the procurement of other major agricultural products. The facts have proven that these measures are beneficial and harmless to both commodity producers and the vast consumers, and only harmful to speculators, because they can no longer speculate. This policy is undoubtedly an important guarantee for the state to realize the five-year plan, and is in line with the current and long-term interests of the people. Of course, the implementation of this policy will change the living habits of tens of millions of people to a certain extent, and reorganize the supply and marketing relationship of the market. Such a major reform will inevitably have some shortcomings in the work in the first few years of its implementation. However, it must be seen that our achievements are the main ones.

Regarding the planned procurement and planned supply of grain, the state has begun to use the method of "fixed production, fixed procurement, and fixed sales" since the spring of 1955, determining that the total amount of planned procurement nationwide will not change in the next three years. Recently, in view of the fact that the sales volume in cities and rural areas is too wide or the supply is inappropriate, specific measures to improve grain supply have been formulated to strictly reduce the sales volume, so that it is possible to appropriately reduce the procurement volume and reserve some grain. These measures not only enable the state to control the necessary amount of grain, ensure the state's supply of grain to the people, but will also be able to further improve the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, and promote the development of agricultural production. This is extremely important for improving urban-rural relations, strengthening the combination of industry and agriculture, and consolidating the unity of the working class and peasants.

Regarding the policy of planned procurement and planned supply of grain, some people have adopted a skeptical or even opposing attitude. Some people, taking advantage of some shortcomings in this work, deny the great achievements of the implementation of this policy. They do not see the fact that the general situation is good. Of course, these are all wrong.

What are the benefits of the planned procurement and planned supply of grain? Farmers have given a good answer. Recently, Mr. Liang Xi, a representative of the National People's Congress, returned from an inspection of rural areas in Zhejiang and said that the farmers of Xiaojian Village in Shaoxing pointed out twelve benefits, which are: "Supporting industrial construction is good, supporting the liberation of Taiwan is good, supporting the people of disaster-stricken areas is good, stabilizing prices is good, promoting mutual aid and cooperation is good, increasing production and developing production is good, saving grain and reducing waste is good, weakening capitalism is good, banks favor savings is good, improving life is good, reasonable supply is good, saving labor is good." We summarize these benefits as follows:

First, support industrial and national defense construction. This means ensuring the demand for grain for 90 million people in cities, towns, and industrial and mining areas, and ensuring the demand for grain for several million national defense and public security troops. Everyone knows that farmers do not want the counter-revolutionary restoration, and they hope to liberate Taiwan. To prevent the counter-revolutionary restoration and liberate Taiwan, industrial and national defense construction is necessary. Therefore, supporting industrial and national defense construction is also protecting the interests of farmers themselves, and farmers understand this very well.

Second, it prevents the buying and selling of grain and other major agricultural products from being manipulated by speculators, avoiding the exploitation of producers and consumers by speculators' buying cheap and selling dear. If the planned procurement and planned supply are not implemented, private merchants will manipulate the grain market, make a fortune, and the stability of market prices throughout the country will be destroyed, capitalism and rural class differentiation will develop, tens of thousands of farmers will go bankrupt, and the lives of workers and urban residents will deteriorate. Obviously, farmers and the vast majority of the people also understand this very well.

Third, promote the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, salt industry, and rural sideline industries. This means ensuring the demand for grain for poor peasants, rural handicraftsmen, and other grain-deficient people, ensuring the demand for grain for farmers and herdsmen, foresters, fishermen, salt workers, and boatmen in technical crop areas, and non-agricultural laborers, so that they can obtain grain at reasonable prices, and thus can concentrate on production.

Fourth, the policy of planned procurement and planned supply of grain has played a great role in ensuring the demand for grain for the people in disaster-stricken areas. For example, in 1954, our country suffered a once-in-a-century flood disaster in a large area. If the state had not implemented such a grain policy, the lives of the people in the disaster-stricken areas and the recovery of production in the disaster-stricken areas would have been unimaginable. The people in the disaster-stricken areas believe that the People's Government is a good government that has never been seen in Chinese history, which is quite understandable.

Fifth, the planned procurement and planned supply of grain has struck at speculators and rich peasants, that is, it has struck at capitalist economy in rural areas, further weakened the influence of capitalism in farmers, and weakened the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of farmers, thereby promoting the development of agricultural production cooperatives.

From this, it can be seen that the planned procurement and planned supply of grain has a major role in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country, and in the vital interests of all the people. This is a major measure for the state to realize the general task of the transition period. Experience has proven that this policy is completely necessary and must be resolutely implemented, but the specific methods of procurement and supply should be continuously improved, shortcomings should be overcome, and achievements should be consolidated.

As much as possible, fully supply and prioritize the supply of production materials and living materials needed by farmers, so that the money obtained by farmers from selling grain can be used to develop production and improve living conditions, which is closely related to the smooth completion of the grain procurement plan; at the same time, this is also important for reducing the pressure on grain supply caused by the purchasing power of rural areas. Therefore, in 1953, while implementing the unified procurement and marketing of grain, the state determined the policy of "industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas should be preferentially supplied to rural areas." In the past two years, the state-owned and cooperative commerce departments have implemented this policy with achievements, but there are also shortcomings. The main problem is that the supply is not timely, and the variety of supply does not fully meet the needs. The needs of farmers are specific and diverse, and they are different in each place. The state-owned and cooperative commerce departments must seriously improve the supply of industrial products to rural areas based on different regions, different seasons, and different habits of farmers.

(Six) On the issue of cultivating and building cadres

The lack of scientific and technological personnel is obviously a major difficulty in our progress. One of the major political tasks we must complete in the first and second five-year plans is to cultivate a large number of cadres who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the cause of socialism, who have modern scientific knowledge, to cultivate skilled workers, and various specialized talents. In the next five years, our work of cultivating and building cadres will be carried out in two aspects, that is, on the one hand, adjusting, expanding, and building new higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools, and on the other hand, using the favorable conditions of enterprises and institutions to set up various evening schools and training classes. Since the liberation of the whole country, the state has actively adjusted and expanded higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools, and carried out the construction of new institutions, and the number of students has increased rapidly. In the next five years, higher education will focus on the development of higher engineering schools and the natural science departments of comprehensive universities, while appropriately developing agriculture, forestry, education, medicine, and other types of schools. By 1957, our country will have 208 higher education institutions. The focus of secondary specialized education is also to cultivate technical and management cadres for industry and agriculture. In higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools, the cultivation of cadres should focus on improving quality in the future, while also taking into account quantity, so that improving quality and increasing quantity are correctly combined. The tendency to pursue quantity at the expense of quality is obviously not beneficial to national construction. Now, various higher engineering schools have already felt that the increase in the number of students is too fast, while the quality of learning is too low. The industrial sector has also universally demanded the improvement of the quality of cadres. In the future, we must pay attention to the issue of student quality, appropriately increase the number of students under the condition of ensuring quality, so that the cadres cultivated are politically reliable, professionally capable of mastering modern scientific and technological knowledge, and physically healthy. Of course, student quality can only be gradually improved. We must actively create conditions for improvement and cannot demand too high and too urgent standards at once, nor can we demand uniformity, but there must be a minimum standard. For example, the minimum condition for new students admitted to higher education institutions should be politically reliable, physically able to persist in learning, and academically able to keep up with the class. Those who do not meet these minimum conditions will not be able to or will have difficulty cultivating useful construction personnel. According to this policy, the Ministry of Higher Education has revised the enrollment plan for higher education institutions for the last three years of the first five-year plan and decided to gradually change the four-year system of higher engineering schools to a five-year system in the next two to three years, and gradually abolish the two-year or three-year specialized courses; for secondary technical schools, it was decided to actively rectify and improve quality, and appropriately expand.

In the future, the plan for cultivating and building cadres should especially focus on the plan for adult education. The state should establish a large number of correspondence schools and evening universities on a gradual basis, so that in-service cadres who have not received systematic scientific and technological education can have the opportunity to gradually and systematically improve their cultural and scientific and technological levels. In factories and mines or industrial areas with a larger scale, in the future, regular worker evening schools should also be gradually and universally established, from primary school to university, to continuously improve the cultural and scientific and technological knowledge of workers. In the past, our educational leadership agencies and trade unions did not pay enough attention to the adult education of workers, allowing it to drift, and many evening schools could not improve because they did not receive leadership, did not receive appropriate teachers and teaching materials. In the future, this shortcoming must be corrected, and the cultivation of in-service workers and employees should be regarded as an important component of the plan for cultivating and building cadres.

In order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction in the country, the current situation where higher education institutions, especially higher engineering schools, are overly concentrated in coastal cities, should be gradually changed in the future development plan. In coastal cities, in the future, generally, new higher education institutions should not be built and existing ones should not be expanded on a large scale. Higher education institutions in inland areas should be gradually built according to a reasonable deployment.

While actively cultivating cadres, various levels of state organs and various enterprise departments should pay great attention to the issue of the reasonable use of existing scientific and technological personnel. Many industrial production units, basic construction units, and other economic units and economic leadership agencies do not reasonably allocate and use the existing scientific and technological personnel, or place some people with specialized skills in other positions, or although they are placed in appropriate positions, they cannot play to their strengths and roles. Generally speaking, the allocation of existing technical personnel is more in the upper and management departments, and at the same time, some enterprise departments and factories do not support the creative inventions and reasonable suggestions of their personnel. It should be recognized that any waste of technical strength is a loss to national construction. Using various excuses to place many people with specialized skills in inappropriate positions for a long time, making them unable to contribute their talents to the country, this phenomenon must not be allowed to continue. On the other hand, we must also pay attention to continuously improving the political and ideological awareness of scientific and technological personnel in the work, so that they can establish the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly, and be able to obey the needs of national construction without fearing any difficulties.

(Seven) On the issue of improving the material and cultural living standards of the people

The highest purpose of the people's revolution and socialist construction is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

Since the liberation of the whole country, the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in our country have been gradually improving. During the three-year recovery period, due to the stabilization of prices, the increase in employment, the increase in wages, and the reform of the land system in rural areas, the income of urban and rural people has increased, and people's material life has been significantly improved, and cultural life has also become more active. The people of ethnic minorities, due to the government's policy of assisting production and developing trade, stabilizing social order, and strengthening cultural and health work and other related measures, have also improved their lives to a certain extent. The indicators and measures stipulated in the five-year plan, as mentioned in the second part of my report, will further improve the material and cultural living standards of the people of the whole country on the original basis.

The indicators and measures for improving the material and cultural living standards of the people stipulated in the five-year plan are the limit that our country can achieve at present. We do not deny that the current living standards of the people in our country are still relatively low. However, the satisfaction of people's needs depends on the level of productive forces, and depends on the material resources that society possesses. The improvement of people's living standards must be based on the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity. The production of industry and agriculture in our country is developing year by year, but the current level of production is still very low; the labor productivity in our country's industry and transportation is improving year by year, but the level of labor productivity is still not high. We must develop production and ensure that the development of production maintains a constant high speed, to establish a material foundation for improving people's lives, we must expand the construction of heavy industry and other industries, so we cannot use the fruits of the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity to improve living standards, but must use an appropriate part of it as capital, to meet the needs of national construction. The question before us is: should we use the necessary financial resources to guarantee national construction, to establish a material foundation for the improvement of people's lives, or should we reduce and postpone construction, and arbitrarily increase wages or spend money? We believe that from the overall and long-term interests of the people of the whole country, we should first use the necessary financial resources to guarantee national construction, and at the same time, improve the living standards according to the indicators stipulated in the five-year plan. Because the purpose of construction is to be able to improve the living standards in the future; without the hard work of construction today, it is impossible to have a happier life in the future. The idea and practice of hoping to improve people's living standards without hard work of construction is pure fantasy and wrong.

Of course, all personnel of state organs and enterprise departments should always and everywhere care about the lives of the masses, and gradually improve the lives of the masses under possible conditions. The attitude of indifference to people's lives, not solving those problems that must be solved and can be solved, is wrong. The correct approach is to combine the current interests of the people with long-term interests, and appropriately improve the living standards of the people on the premise of guaranteeing national construction. The indicators and measures for improving the material and cultural living standards of the people stipulated in the five-year plan must be guaranteed to be implemented as much as possible, so that the people of all ethnic groups in our country can truly experience the necessity of national construction and the personal interests of each individual, and thus more actively and creatively participate in national construction.

People have raised such questions: Can we increase the production of daily necessities more than the indicators stipulated in the five-year plan, to meet the needs of the people more? We believe that we should strive to increase production, and also strive to increase the supply. However, it should be seen that due to the increase in the number of employed people, the increase in the purchasing power of farmers, and the increase in consumption by those who have consumed less of these consumer goods in the past, and the fact that the national population is as large as 600 million, therefore, the actual increase in consumption per person is still limited for the time being. We should of course continue to strive to tap the potential for production, and it is wrong to ignore this effort. However, as we said earlier, the increase in industrial raw materials is temporarily restricted to a certain extent. The large-scale increase in agricultural products or consumer goods made from agricultural raw materials can only be realized after large-scale mechanization of agriculture and large-scale use of machinery for land reclamation.

People have also raised such questions: Can we increase the facilities for cultural and educational undertakings to adapt to the increasing needs of the people in this regard? We believe that more measures should be taken to appropriately handle this problem. The various indicators of cultural and educational undertakings in our country have already exceeded the highest level before liberation in 1952, and on this basis, the five-year plan has stipulated further development indicators. However, due to the higher requirements of the people for cultural life, some cultural and educational facilities still cannot fully meet the needs of the people, such as primary schools cannot fully meet the demand for school-age children to enroll, and middle schools cannot fully meet the demand for primary school graduates to advance. To handle this problem, the state, in addition to continuing to develop cultural and educational undertakings in a planned manner, advocates that the people themselves set up some cultural and educational undertakings, such as primary schools, farmers' evening schools, and amateur drama troupes; the state will provide guidance in work and provide assistance in manpower, financial, and material aspects as far as possible. At the same time, local governments, institutions, and enterprises should try to set up various remedial classes, night schools, correspondence schools, etc., so that those young people who cannot advance to higher education can continue to improve their cultural level in labor production.

The improvement of people's living standards can only be a steady improvement, and people's happiness must be obtained through their own diligent labor. We can fully believe that after the diligent and thrifty labor of 600 million people, after implementing a few five-year plans to greatly improve the productive forces of our country, it will be possible to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. This is the only broad and smooth path for the people of our country to improve their living standards, and there are no shortcuts.

(Eight) On the issue of strict economy

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy is a five-year plan with the focus on vigorously developing heavy industry. The construction of heavy industry requires long-term investment of a large amount of construction funds. The funds necessary for this industrialization must be obtained from the accumulation within our country. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a strict economy system, eliminate all unnecessary expenditures and inappropriate non-production expenditures, and not allow any waste, so as to accumulate all possible funds to meet the needs of national construction and increase the necessary reserves of the state.

When Stalin summarized the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union, he said: "To implement extremely strict savings methods and accumulate the funds necessary for assisting our industrialization, this is the road we must take to achieve the goal of establishing heavy industry and realizing the five-year plan." The road that the Soviet Union has taken is also the road that we should take now. At present, our national economy is more backward than that of the Soviet Union during the implementation of the first five-year plan, and the accumulation of construction funds in our country will be even more difficult. Therefore, we must learn from the spirit of frugal construction of the Soviet people in the past, and continue to carry forward the excellent tradition of hard work and hard struggle of the people of our country.

In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the work efficiency of state organs, the continuous improvement of the management of state-owned enterprises, we have reduced the cost of construction, installation, production, transportation, and commodity circulation year by year. This has increased the accumulation of national construction funds and reduced the waste of national construction funds. These achievements are undoubtedly worthy of affirmation. However, we cannot deny that at present, some aspects, some departments, some places, and some enterprises still have serious waste phenomena. A considerable number of workers have forgotten the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle of the Communist Party of China, do not understand that after the victory of the people's revolution, the construction of socialist industrialization still requires our long-term self-sacrificing efforts, and thus often violate the economy system of the state and the economic accounting system. In the article "Economic and Financial Problems during the Anti-Japanese War," Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "Economy is something that all work units must pay attention to, and economic and financial work units must pay special attention to it." In order to build socialism, our current task is to seriously implement Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction, effectively establish various economy systems, and truly learn to manage state organs and state-owned enterprises with economy methods, and fight against all waste phenomena in all aspects.

First of all, we must greatly reduce the expenditure of non-production construction. In recent years, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in non-production construction has been universal and serious.

According to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau: the non-production investment of the six industrial departments under the Central Government accounted for 21.6% of the total investment in 1953 and 1954, but in the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union, the non-production investment in the industrial sector only accounted for 14.5% of the total investment. In 1954, the non-production investment in the basic construction investment of the whole country accounted for 24.3%. We must change this unreasonable investment ratio.

In the construction of non-production buildings, due to the neglect of the principle of "practicality, economy, and attention to beauty under possible conditions," blindly pursuing the so-called "national form," emphasizing luxurious decoration, and extensively using precious or special materials, have caused astonishing waste. Just for the "big roof," the 39 buildings of various organs in Beijing have wasted 5.4 million yuan. The building of Changchun Geological Institute, known as the "Geological Palace," is a very famous luxurious building. The institute was built on the basis of an unfinished royal palace of the puppet regime, and because of the many unnecessary decorations, the construction cost per square meter was 220 yuan, and with the original foundation, the construction cost reached 300 yuan, exceeding the construction cost stipulated by the state by 125 yuan, which is 140% more. The construction cost of some dormitories for workers and staff is also too high. For example, the 150,000 square meters of workers' dormitories built by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1953 had a unit construction cost of 163 yuan.

The result of excessive decoration is not only that the construction cost of the building will be greatly increased, but also that the usable area will be greatly reduced. The main building of a building in Beijing has a construction cost of 293 yuan per square meter, but the usable area only accounts for 44%. The construction cost of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's design building is as high as 240 yuan (60% higher than the budget, a total waste of 1.38 million yuan), but the usable area is still less than 50%. These buildings that pursue formal luxury are also without exception neglecting the needs and interests of the users. For example, the laundry room of a sanatorium has a unit construction cost of 346 yuan, and after installing washing machines, the gap is too small, and workers operate very inconveniently; its kitchen area is 450 square meters, and the unit construction cost is as high as 275 yuan, but there is no place to store rice and flour.

After building luxurious houses, it is necessary to correspondingly purchase luxurious indoor equipment, so the trend of purchasing carpets, sofas, and other high-end luxury goods has also developed.

All these luxurious non-production constructions are unacceptable and do not conform to our socialist industrialization construction policy.

Obviously, reducing the above-mentioned expenditures of non-production construction and overcoming other waste, this will save a large amount of funds.

Second, we must greatly reduce the cost of production construction.

Some industrial construction units do not act according to the construction procedures, do not clarify the situation, do not carry out systematic preparatory work, and even start material procurement blindly and rush to construction without a confirmed construction plan, resulting in the universal occurrence of waste of funds and accumulation of materials. For example, the reconstruction project of a steel plant is a typical case of waste. When the scale of the reconstruction of this plant had not been determined, the design had already begun. The design was not completed, and the construction had begun. After the construction started, the design was constantly modified, resulting in the construction drawings not being delivered on time, or being discarded after delivery. Some drawings were delivered in reverse order and construction sequence, and some drawings were marked "for reference only," and could not be used as the basis for construction. Due to the simultaneous design and construction, the constant change of the design, and the disruption of the construction plan, sometimes there was idle work, sometimes there was rush work, and the equipment and materials were accumulated. In this situation, the faster the progress of the project, the slower it is. The construction project of this plant had just begun, and the work completed in 1954 was less than half of the original plan. The idle work expenditure alone was 2 million yuan, and the accumulated materials reached more than 700 million yuan. This lesson of not making sufficient preparations and not making good designs before construction must be deeply noted by all basic construction units.

The more important the construction unit, the greater the possibility of waste. Because these projects are often supported by the whole country and are not spared of effort, people's attention is on its completion, and often neglect and forgive its waste. By the end of November 1954, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had accumulated materials worth 10.57 million yuan, and various wastes such as material scrapping, equipment damage, large materials used as small materials, good materials used as inferior materials, idle work, design errors, and poor management totaled 6.3 million yuan.

The waste in construction also manifests itself in poor labor organization, low utilization rate of machinery and equipment, low construction quality, and as a result, low labor productivity and high construction cost.

Obviously, reducing the cost of production construction will also save a large amount of funds.

Third, we must greatly strengthen the economic accounting system in various production departments, transportation and communication departments, and commercial departments.

We have many enterprises with very poor product quality, and a lot of defective products. For example, some factories under the First Ministry of Machine Industry, due to poor technical control, low product quality, resulting in a large number of rework and scrap in production, the scrap rate of castings in 1954 was 12.5% (the scrap rate of cast iron in the Soviet Union was 5%), and the scrap of pig iron reached more than 20,000 tons, and together with the scrap in processing, the total loss in the year was more than 20 million yuan.

In the first quarter of 1955, many products had poor quality, especially the products of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Industry had a more widespread phenomenon of poor quality. In the products of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the pig iron produced in the first quarter, due to excessive sulfur content, did not meet the specifications, reaching 4,632 tons; the large steel and bridge steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company, due to the chemical composition not meeting the requirements, had 30% that did not meet the specifications; the production of glass, all enterprises did not complete the first-class product rate index. In the products of enterprises under the Ministry of Machine Industry, for example, the 322 50-ton open cars produced by Dalian Railway Vehicle Factory in the first quarter, due to the performance not meeting the design requirements, 90% needed to be reworked and repaired. In particular, the Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory, the 380 drilling machines produced by this factory, due to the violation of the prescribed trial production procedures, the performance did not meet the design requirements, all needed to be repaired, and the loss of parts alone reached 12 million yuan, resulting in no finished products being produced from September 1954 to the first quarter of 1955. The production of plows, due to the curve of the plows not meeting the requirements, the hardness not reaching the standard after quenching, resulting in 40% of the products being defective. In textile products, the Ministry of Textile Industry did not complete the first-class product rate plan for cotton cloth and printed cloth in the first quarter. The quality of some products of enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry, such as rubber shoes and sugar, was unstable or deteriorated, and the situation was also more serious than before.

We have many enterprises that waste a lot of resources due to poor management. For example, the Harbin Food Company had 50 or more waste incidents in 1954, and the waste figures that could be checked in the accounts reached 5.7 million yuan. The livestock processing plant of this company had a total loss of more than 8 million yuan in 1954, but exactly how much was wasted and lost is still a mess.

In the newspaper, a material was published, and some enterprises under the Ministry of Commerce had wasted 80 million yuan on dead pigs and rotten eggs in 1954 due to poor management.

We still have many enterprises where the number of non-production personnel is too high, and the organization is bloated. For example, the number of production workers in Benxi Iron and Steel Company only accounts for 56% of the total number of employees, and the number of management personnel accounts for about one-fourth of the total number of employees. There are not a few such examples. According to the investigation by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: the Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Qinghe Woolen Mill can reduce 3,600 people, accounting for one-fourth of the total number of employees in the three units.

Obviously, strengthening the economic accounting system in various economic departments, thereby reducing waste, reducing defective products, lowering consumption quotas, lowering costs and circulation expenses, and reducing non-production personnel, this will also save a large amount of funds.

Fourth, we must further reduce the administrative management expenses of state organs.

In recent years, the administrative management expenses of state organs have been gradually reduced in proportion to the total expenditure of the state. However, up to now, there are still many state organs in our country that are overstaffed, with too many people, and some organs are still blindly recruiting people, thus making it difficult to further reduce administrative management expenses. According to the policy of streamlining organizations, tightening staffing, and adjusting cadres, it has now been decided to start the reorganization work from the central organs, and to plan to transfer a batch of cadres from the central organs to strengthen the grassroots and basic production units. Local organs at all levels should also carry out this reorganization work in a stepwise manner. Experience has shown that for organs with too many people, after reducing some people, not only will the work not be weakened, but it will be done better. In the future, the increase in personnel needed by various organs should be strictly restricted, and the adjustment should be carried out as much as possible among the existing organ personnel. The state should formulate laws to require all civil servants (including enterprise employees) to obey the government's order to transfer jobs. Only in this way can manpower be reasonably used and state financial resources be saved.

As for the many phenomena of extravagance and waste that still exist in many state organs, they must be immediately prohibited.

Obviously, after streamlining the organization and eliminating the many phenomena of extravagance and waste in state organs, this will also save a large amount of funds.

In short, in the future, the state must establish a series of economy systems and economy methods in all aspects, stipulating what is allowed to be done and what is not allowed to be done. All those that are not allowed to be done, if done, are illegal.

The State Council stipulates: in the next three years, the construction and installation costs of production construction should be at least 10% lower than the original plan; the construction costs of various non-production constructions should be at least 15% lower than the original plan. On this basis, whether it is production construction or non-production construction, the cost should be reduced by 2% to 3%, or even more, every year. In this way, at least 2 billion yuan will be saved for the state. This fund, if used for industrial construction, can build a metallurgical enterprise with an annual output of 150 million tons of steel, or 30 five-million-kilowatt power stations, or 5 factories with an annual output of 15,000 tractors; if used for railway construction, it can build more than 3,000 kilometers of new railways; if used for agricultural construction, it can open 40 to 50 million mu of wasteland. From this, it can be seen how important strict economy is to the socialist construction of our country.

In order to implement a comprehensive economy, it is necessary to severely criticize various thoughts that oppose economy and promote waste.

1. It is necessary to criticize the idea of "everything starting up." Because the so-called "everything starting up" will make the construction lose its focus, and because the funds are dispersed in too many projects, the result will be that the construction time will be dragged out too long, and the effect of investment cannot be quickly realized.

2. It is necessary to criticize the idea that "in order to build modern industrial enterprises, other non-production constructions and welfare facilities must also be modernized." Because the modernization of life should first have the foundation of industrial modernization, without the foundation of industrialization and the modernization of agriculture, and prematurely requiring the modernization of life, it will actually delay the modernization of industry.

3. It is necessary to criticize the idea of "wide budget and narrow use." Because since the budget is allowed to be wide, it must not be narrow in use, wide budget can only be wide in use, and the result will inevitably be waste.

4. It is necessary to criticize the idea that "construction experience is not enough, work experience is not enough, and some waste is inevitable." Because the person in charge of the work has this idea, then waste is definitely inevitable.

5. It is necessary to criticize the idea of looking at waste as "small things" by isolating one waste incident from another, and treating waste as a "small thing." Now such "small things" exist in any factory, enterprise, any organ, and school, and because this is called a "small thing," it is familiar and ignored every day. However, any small waste, if not corrected, when calculated for the entire department, the entire country, calculated for one year, five years, ten years, twenty years, then there is no waste that is not huge. We must observe "small things" in this way, so as not to continue to waste by familiar and ignoring, and to know that correcting these "small things" is very necessary, and needs to be done immediately.

Overcoming the above series of wrong ideas is a condition for launching the economy movement.

The state must strengthen financial supervision to ensure the implementation of the economy system. Not only the financial department should strengthen the financial supervision agency, but all enterprise departments and administrative and military departments should also establish their own financial supervision agencies. Any organ, any person, must abide by the financial system and obey financial supervision. Any organ, any person, should not forgive themselves or others in the matter of waste, or use mutual forgiveness to replace mutual supervision and inspection.

The economy movement must be a movement of the whole people. The people of the whole country, first of all, all employees must be mobilized to actively participate in the struggle of saving funds, opposing waste, and supervising finances in various enterprises and organs.

(Nine) On the relationship between the construction of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and our country

Now I would like to talk about the relationship between the international aid of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and our construction.

Everyone knows that our country can implement the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy so quickly, which is inseparable from the aid of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially the aid of the Soviet Union. The 156 industrial construction units designed by the Soviet Union are the center of the first five-year plan industrial construction in our country.

The aid of the Soviet Union to our construction is comprehensive and systematic. The 156 industrial units aided by the Soviet Union, from geological prospecting, selecting factory sites, collecting basic design data, carrying out design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and start-up, supplying technical data of new types of products, to guiding the manufacture of new products, etc., in short, from beginning to end, they are fully aided. The designs provided by the Soviet Union extensively adopt the latest technological achievements, and the equipment given to us by the Soviet Union are all first-class and the most advanced. In order to help us, the great Soviet working class strives to manufacture the equipment we need as quickly and as well as possible with the highest labor enthusiasm, and the great Soviet government gives us the best equipment first. The Soviet government and our government also signed a scientific and technological agreement, and through this agreement, the aid of the Soviet Union to our economic construction is also very great. The Soviet government actively proposed to assist us in the research of the peaceful use of atomic energy, and signed an agreement with us on the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Soviet Union has spared a large number of experts from its busy socialist construction to help us. They introduced the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction to us, and specifically helped us to carry out various economic work. All the Soviet experts sent to our country not only have profound scientific and technological knowledge and rich practical work experience, but also have a high spirit of internationalism and a selfless attitude towards labor. They have loyally, selflessly, and without reservation contributed their experience, knowledge, and skills in the fields of industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, railways, transportation, postal services, construction, geology, education, health, and other departments in our country, and in scientific and technological and cultural cooperation, they treat the great cause of building socialism in our country as their own cause. The labor attitude of Soviet experts, which is full of communism, has become a model for the people of our country to learn from. It should be said that our important achievements in economic construction are inseparable from the help of Soviet experts.

The Soviet Union has spared a great deal of effort to help us cultivate technical personnel. The Soviet Union has accepted a large number of our students and trainees, and has given them various convenient conditions for study and practice, which is extremely important for us to master modern industrial technology, ensure the start-up of new enterprises, and improve our scientific level. The Soviet experts who came to our country also made many contributions in cultivating our technical personnel.

The Soviet government has given us significant financial aid, and has continuously loaned us at the most favorable terms, and in the trade relations between the two countries, it has enabled us to obtain cheap technical equipment and materials. This loan and the benefits in trade have also helped the rapid recovery and development of our economy, especially the help of our industrial construction.

From this, it can be seen that the reason why our current construction can have such a large scale, such a fast speed, such a high technical level, and can also avoid many mistakes, the aid of the Soviet Union has played an extremely important role.

In addition to the aid of the Soviet Union, our construction has also received economic and technical aid from people's democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, Mongolia, Bulgaria, and Albania, these people's democratic countries also have economic cooperation with our country.

The heroic people of Korea and the heroic people of Vietnam, their struggle for the independence and freedom of their countries, occupy an important position in the world's peace and democratic movement. Their struggle also has great significance for our construction cause.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people express their heartfelt thanks to the aid of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially the great, long-term, comprehensive, and selfless aid of the Soviet Union. In order to consolidate and develop the socialist construction cause of our country, we must further consolidate and develop the economic alliance and friendly cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, to promote the common prosperity of the socialist camp, and strengthen the forces of world peace and democracy.

Four, Struggle to Complete and Overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan

Our first five-year plan has been implemented for two years. The situation of the plan's implementation in 1953 and 1954 is basically good, although some errors and shortcomings have been exposed in the work and plans.

In terms of the total industrial and agricultural output value: in 1953, it increased by 14.4% compared to 1952, and in 1954, it increased by 9.4% compared to 1953. The average annual increase over two years is 11.9%, exceeding the speed of 8.6% annual average increase stipulated in the five-year plan.

In terms of basic construction: the basic construction plan over the past two years has been nearly completed each year. The reason for not fully completing the plan is: the collection of basic data needed for design was delayed, the design work could not catch up, materials, drawings, and equipment could not be supplied on time, there was a lack of a realistic construction plan according to the progress, and the construction site was not yet standardized, with considerable chaos.

The actual completed investment (i.e., work volume) over the past two years accounts for 32% of the total investment over five years. Over the past two years, 136 industrial construction units above the limit have been put into production, and the newly increased production capacity is mainly: 427,000 tons of steel, 530,000 kilowatts of electricity, 13 million tons of coal, 6.5 million tons of cement, 700,000 spindles, 400,000 tons of paper, 160,000 tires, 109,000 tons of sugar. Over the past two years, 1,400 kilometers of new railway tracks have been laid, including the completion of track laying for the railway from Jingning to Ertian and the railway from Lintang to Zhanjiang; 6,600 kilometers of new highways have been built, including the main ones being the Kangding-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Important water conservancy projects completed over the past two years include: the Sanhe Regulating Sluice and Boshan Reservoir in the Huaihe River Basin, the Guanting Reservoir in the Yongding River and the Duliushan River Project in Hebei Province, etc. The Foziling Reservoir in the Huaihe River Basin has also been basically completed. They played a significant role in defending against the special floods in 1954. Over the past two years, various types of buildings with a total area of approximately 780 million square meters have been built by the state.

In terms of industrial production: the annual plans for the two years have been overfulfilled, and the total industrial output value in 1954 increased by 53.7% compared to 1952; the production of important products has increased significantly, such as iron by 56%, steel by 65%, electricity by 51%, coal by 26%, cement by 61%, timber by 111%, cotton cloth by 37%. The labor productivity of state-owned industry over the past two years has increased by 29%, and the product cost has been reduced by 9.6%. The changes brought about by the development of industry over the past two years: first, the proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 26.7% in 1952 to 33% in 1954; second, the proportion of the output value of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private industry in the total industrial output value has increased from 61% in 1952 to 75.1% in 1954.

In terms of agricultural production: due to the spring drought and autumn waterlogging in many areas in 1953 and the special floods in many areas in 1954, the agricultural production plans for the past two years were not completed. However, the grain production in 1954, in terms of the national scope, increased by 3.4% compared to 1952, and sugar crops, oil crops, and tobacco and other technical crops generally increased over the past two years, but cotton production decreased. Over the past two years, agricultural production cooperatives have developed greatly, and by the end of 1954, nearly 500,000 have been developed, creating favorable conditions for the further development of agricultural production and agricultural cooperativization.

In terms of transportation and communication: the turnover of goods on railways over the past two years has increased by 55%, and the turnover of passengers has increased by 45%; the turnover of goods on coastal and inland ships has increased by 85%; the turnover of goods on highway buses has increased by 175%; civil aviation and postal services have also developed considerably.

In terms of commerce: the total social retail volume in 1954 was approximately 41.7% higher than in 1952. The proportion of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in domestic commercial wholesale has increased from 63% in 1952 to 89% in 1954; in social retail, it has increased from 34% in 1952 to 58% in 1954.

In terms of culture, education, and health: in 1954 compared to 1952, the number of students in higher education institutions increased by 33%, the number of students in ordinary middle schools increased by 44%, and the number of students in primary schools also increased after focusing on rectification and consolidation over the past two years. In 1954 compared to 1952, the number of hospital beds increased by 34%.

Over the past two years, the total number of workers and employees in state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private enterprises and cultural and educational undertakings, and state organs has increased by approximately 3 million, excluding workers and employees who have transferred from private to joint state-private and state-owned enterprises, with a net increase of about 2 million; the total wage bill over the past two years has increased by 56%, and the average wage of workers and employees has increased by 14% in terms of currency. The income of farmers from agriculture and sideline industries has increased by approximately 7% over the past two years.

The above situation shows that the annual plans for 1953 and 1954 have been successfully realized under the guidance of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and the efforts of the people of the whole country. It is completely possible to complete and strive to overfulfill the various indicators stipulated in the five-year plan. Imperialists and reactionaries have repeatedly shamelessly spread lies, saying that China has no possibility of realizing industrialization, or that the five-year plan has failed. However, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have already and will continue to prove to the world with brilliant facts: we not only have the strength to complete the great task of the people's democratic revolution, but also have the strength to complete the more great task of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Of course, the tasks of the first five-year plan in our country are very arduous in all aspects. The tasks in the latter three years will be even more arduous than in the first two years. From 1955 to 1957, basic construction will complete 68% of the total investment over five years, and many large-scale, technically complex factories, mines, railways, and water conservancy projects will be started simultaneously; the total industrial output value will increase by 29% on the basis of 1954, and many technically complex new types of products will be successfully tested and produced in large quantities; the task of agricultural production is very tight, with a 13.7% increase in grain production on the basis of 1954, which is an increase of 466 billion catties, and a 53.5% increase in cotton production, which is an increase of 114 million piculs; the turnover of goods on railways will increase by 30% on the basis of 1954, and the transportation tasks of highway buses and waterways are also very heavy; according to the estimation of social purchasing power, the social commodity retail volume will increase by 27% compared to 1954. The tasks of work in culture, education, scientific research, health, and other aspects will also be very arduous in the latter three years. The work of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce will require more in-depth and detailed work, and should be arranged in a unified manner according to the principle of comprehensive balancing. The above various aspects indicate that the latter three years are the most important years in the five-year plan, and only by fully completing the work in the latter three years can the five-year plan be fully completed.

During the first five-year plan period, it is inevitable that we will encounter difficulties in carrying out large-scale construction work on the basis of the original weak productive forces. Our work is very tense. In the past two and a half years, we have overcome many difficulties and completed many arduous and complex tasks, but in the future, we will still encounter various difficulties, and the tasks will be more arduous and complex. We must fully estimate the difficulties that will arise from the contradiction between the supply of technical personnel and equipment and the needs of construction, the difficulties that will arise from the lag of agriculture behind the rapid development of industry, and the difficulties in the unified arrangement of various economic components in the process of socialist transformation. Facing these difficulties, we must use manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the most reasonable and effective way, strengthen work in all aspects, and take appropriate measures to overcome them. We must remain fully alert to domestic and foreign enemies at all times and defeat their sabotage and resistance. At the same time, due to our lack of experience in planning work and incomplete statistical data, this will inevitably affect the accuracy of the plan. Therefore, in the process of plan implementation, we must pay attention to the combination of planning work and actual development at all times, and based on actual experience and the creative experience of the broad masses, continuously make the plan more accurate and more perfect.

The first five-year plan is a program of decisive significance for the Communist Party of China to lead the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the general task of the transition period. The successful completion of the first five-year plan will enable us to achieve a decisive victory in the realization of the general task of the transition period. Therefore, the people of the whole country must unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, mobilize, and work diligently to overcome difficulties, increase production, practice strict economy, and struggle to fully realize the five-year plan.

In the struggle to realize the five-year plan, the active role and creativity of the working class of the whole country in increasing labor productivity and reducing costs are of primary importance. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to strive to improve the political awareness, technical and cultural level, and business level of the masses of workers and employees, launch labor competitions, consolidate labor discipline, learn and promote advanced experience, and make the majority of workers and employees active fighters in the struggle to fully complete the state plan.

Everyone knows: the five-year plan for the development of the national economy is not only an industrial plan, but also a plan for agriculture and all other economic sectors. Therefore, the labor of workers and employees in all state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, private enterprises, as well as handicraftsmen and handicraft workers, the labor of all state-owned farm workers, members of agricultural production cooperatives, individual farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen, the labor of all personnel in national economic work departments, including industrial, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, railway, transportation, postal, commercial, grain, financial, and various work departments, are all indispensable labor for the completion of the five-year plan, and are glorious labor. Precisely because of this, not only workers and employees in state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and state-owned farms are responsible for completing the indicators for them stipulated in the five-year plan, but workers and employees in joint state-private and private enterprises, as well as all employees, members of agricultural production cooperatives, individual farmers, handicraftsmen and handicraft workers, personnel in national economic work departments are also equally responsible for completing the tasks for them stipulated in the five-year plan. Only when the people of the whole country complete the production tasks can the first five-year plan be fully and perfectly realized.

Industry and agriculture are the two main sectors of the national economy, and workers and peasants are the largest number of laborers in the country. The alliance between workers and peasants is the basis for the great victory of the people's revolution in our country, and strengthening and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class is the basis for completing the first five-year plan and striving for socialist victory. Therefore, we must rely on the basic social force of the alliance between workers and peasants to fully tap all possible potential forces in our country's economy, and at the same time, prepare necessary reserve forces, so that the victory of the first five-year plan in our country can be reliably guaranteed.

Everyone also knows: our economic work in industry, agriculture, and other economic sectors is not carried out in isolation, and they must be combined with education, culture, health, justice, supervision, public security, civil affairs, diplomacy, national defense, and other work. Therefore, the labor of all personnel serving in these aspects, including a part of freelancers in cultural and health undertakings, is also indispensable labor in the five-year plan. Seriously doing their own work is also completing the tasks they should undertake in the five-year plan. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army are responsible for the glorious and important task of defending the motherland and defending socialist construction. In recent years, many labor models and advanced workers have emerged in the economic front of industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce, and many labor models and advanced workers have also emerged in the cultural and educational front. In various administrative work departments, there are also many model workers, which is the honor of our country. All labor models and advanced workers should further give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity, better complete the tasks they undertake, and play a leading, backbone, and bridging role in the masses, uniting and leading the broad masses to strive for the overfulfillment of the five-year plan. In the struggle to realize the five-year plan, scientific and technological workers bear a heavy responsibility. The cause of socialist construction urgently needs science and technology, and without science and technology, socialism cannot be built. Therefore, scientific research personnel and engineering and technical personnel in any department should continuously improve their political and ideological awareness and scientific and technological level, strengthen the connection between theory and practice, pay attention to the connection between scientific research and production work, and give full play to the role of science and technology in the cause of socialist construction, and contribute their wisdom to the state and the people.

Youth and women should also actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Young people should temper their bodies, learn culture and science, cultivate the habit of labor and good moral character, do a good job, and serve the construction and defense of the motherland. Women should also improve their political awareness, improve their production and work abilities, and actively participate in the construction of the state.

The five-year plan is closely related to the people of all ethnic groups and all classes in the country. The five-year plan requires the people of all ethnic groups in the country to unite more firmly, requires the people of all ethnic groups to strengthen economic and cultural ties and cooperation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups should actively participate in the political life and economic construction of the whole country, and work together to build our motherland. At the same time, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the autonomy of ethnic minority areas should be realized, and efforts should be made to develop the economy and cultural education in ethnic minority areas, and strengthen medical and health work. The Han people must sincerely help the various brotherly ethnic minorities in economy and culture, so as to gradually improve the lives of the people of various ethnic minorities. The socialist transformation of various ethnic minorities should be carried out according to the historical development characteristics of their own ethnic groups, respecting the will of the people.

Due to the special historical conditions of our country, the working class and the national bourgeoisie have an alliance relationship in politics and economy. In the transition period, the national bourgeoisie still has an important role in the national economy. The responsibility of industrial and commercial capitalists in the five-year plan is to obey the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working class, engage in businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, honestly obey the state plan, do a good job in the tasks entrusted by the state, and accept socialist transformation. In this way, they can correctly play their due role in the five-year plan and make a certain contribution to the five-year plan.

Overseas Chinese are patriotic and hope for the prosperity and strength of their motherland. The state should pay attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and at the same time, overseas Chinese should also further unite and actively participate in the construction of the motherland.

To fully complete the five-year plan, not only must there be a unified leadership of policies, principles, and steps at the national level, but also must have specific measures of local state organs and party organizations at all levels to realize the local tasks stipulated in the plan, especially the tasks related to agricultural production. Local state organs and party organizations at all levels must not only be responsible for managing various economic and cultural education undertakings in the local area, but also manage the political work and party work of factories, mines, basic construction sites, economic enterprises, and cultural institutions under the jurisdiction of the central government in their own jurisdiction, check the degree of implementation of the state plan by these enterprises and institutions, and supervise and help them complete the plan. Central enterprises and institutions scattered in various places must obey the leadership of local state organs and party organizations, and if there is a tendency to disobey local leadership in them, it must be seriously fought against and corrected. The departments under the State Council must fully rely on the initiative of local leadership organs to realize the state plan.

In order to advance our cause victoriously, all Communist Party members, all personnel of state organs, and all work cadres of various enterprise departments must further improve their work style, strive to overcome various shortcomings and errors in their work. Undoubtedly, the vast majority of Communist Party members and state organ personnel are working diligently for the people, actively striving to complete the work tasks entrusted by the party, the state, and the masses, and are able to connect with the masses and engage in self-criticism. But it cannot be denied that some Communist Party members and state organ personnel, due to being satisfied with their existing achievements, have already developed a very dangerous sense of pride, do not want to expose and overcome the shortcomings and errors in their work; they do not go deep into the grassroots to carry out specific leadership, but adopt bureaucratic and clerical methods to carry out generalized leadership, and are not responsible for their own work and the property of the state. There are even some people who, in order to achieve their personal goals, exaggerate their work achievements, conceal the errors and shortcomings in their work, and cover up the behavior of violating party and state discipline. Obviously, if we do not resolutely fight against this bad tendency, our cause cannot advance, and the five-year plan cannot be successfully realized. Therefore, the party and the state require all Communist Party members and workers, especially leading cadres, to honestly fulfill their responsibilities to the party and the state, set an example, work hard, strive to study business, improve political level, go deep into the grassroots, investigate and study the situation, concretely solve the actual problems existing in the work, expose and overcome the shortcomings and errors in the work, supervise and help the subordinate units to better complete the state plan.

We have already started a large-scale construction, our experience is not enough, our technical level is not high, if we do not seriously study economic work and other related work, we will not be able to smoothly complete the five-year plan. We should, on the one hand, learn in production and work, summarize our own experience, and improve our abilities, and on the other hand, absorb all the advanced knowledge in the world and reasonably apply it to production and work. We should learn from all the brotherly countries, especially learn from the Soviet Union, and learn from Soviet experts. People often talk about gratitude for the aid of the Soviet Union and the brotherly countries. Due to the great, selfless aid of the Soviet Union and the brotherly countries, people's gratitude is completely natural. However, the best way to thank the Soviet Union and the brotherly countries is not to do anything else, but to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the brotherly countries, to learn the knowledge that Soviet and brotherly country experts teach us in construction, to fully realize the state's five-year plan. Our current construction is much more favorable than the conditions of the Soviet Union at that time, because the Soviet Union once built socialism alone in a country surrounded by capitalism, while we already have the experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries with high technology. We should make full use of these favorable conditions to learn, so that after a few five-year plans, we can improve the construction experience and scientific and technological level of our country to the level it should be.

We must learn to do economic work, and at the same time, we must do political work, and constantly propagate Marxism-Leninism to the broad masses, propagate the policies of the party in various periods, and propagate the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. All cadres engaged in leadership work should seriously study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Chairman Mao Zedong, criticize bourgeois ideology, continuously improve their theoretical level, so as to do the work better.

The realization of the five-year plan is a special form of class struggle under the current environment. The complete realization of the five-year plan will enable the industry and the entire national economy of our country to develop greatly, and the proportion of socialist economic components will increase greatly, while the proportion of non-socialist economic components will decrease greatly. This means that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance between workers and peasants will be further consolidated. All these will make the people of the whole country and our friends around the world rejoice. However, the victory of the people is the failure of the people's enemies, and the failure of the counter-revolutionary restoration attempts of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek sellout clique, and all anti-people elements. The people's enemies will never want their own failure, and they will inevitably use all means to sabotage our five-year plan. American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek sellout clique are further threatening us with war; the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek sellout clique hidden on the mainland are constantly carrying out various sabotage activities; some landlords and counter-revolutionaries are using some shortcomings in our work to incite the masses; some unscrupulous capitalists are also using various means to resist the socialist transformation. All these show that the people's enemies will use various methods to sabotage the five-year plan, and the realization of the five-year plan is a complex and sharp class struggle. The people of the whole country must always be politically vigilant, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and break through any form of sabotage of the five-year plan by domestic and foreign enemies and reactionaries. There have been many state organ and enterprise department personnel who have been complacent about the sabotage activities of hidden enemies, and have been indifferent to the various accidents caused by counter-revolutionaries, which is a very dangerous tendency and must be corrected immediately. The recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory for the people of the whole country in the struggle against counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

The Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause, and the unity of the Communist Party of China is the core of the unity of the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China has always maintained a solid and unbreakable unity. Especially after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the Communist Party of China exposed and smashed the anti-party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, and the Communist Party of China became more united and more consolidated. Gao Gang and Rao Shushi are the agents of imperialism and the bourgeoisie in our party, and the struggle against the anti-party activities of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi is a struggle to defend the Communist Party, defend socialist construction, and defend communism. The great victory of smashing the anti-party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi is a great victory for us in carrying out socialist construction. This victory proves the unity of the Communist Party of China, and will further consolidate this unity. Of course, the Communist Party of China, in order to continuously strengthen the unity of the party, will continue to be vigilant and pay attention to and smash the conspiracies and tricks of domestic and foreign enemies, and resolutely fight against all speeches and actions that are not conducive to the unity of the party, correct the arrogant and complacent sentiments of some Communist Party members, and more unitedly and more strongly lead the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the general task of the state in the transition period and the task of the first five-year plan.

At the opening of the first session of the First National People's Congress, Chairman Mao Zedong instructed, "Our general task is: to unite the people of the whole country, to seek the support of all international friends, to struggle for the construction of a great socialist country, and to struggle for the defense of international peace and the development of the cause of human progress." Based on the instruction of Chairman Mao Zedong, we must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, consolidate the unity between the working class and peasants, and consolidate the people's democratic united front. At the same time, on the basis of the solid unity of the whole party and the people of the whole country, we will further strengthen the unity with the great ally country, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries, to further strengthen the forces of defending world peace. Our country will also further strengthen friendly cooperation with all peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa. Based on the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our country has already established friendly cooperative relations with India, Burma, and Indonesia. Our country is willing to establish peaceful cooperative relations with any country in the world based on the same principles and sincerity, expand economic and cultural ties, as long as these countries also have the same aspirations and sincerity. The principles of China's foreign policy are to safeguard the independence, freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the country, to support the lasting peace of the world and the friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries, and to oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism. We will persist in participating in all struggles to ease international tensions.

Dear representatives! Our first five-year plan is a great plan, which will begin to change the history of economic backwardness in our country for a hundred years and push our country towards the goal of an industrialized socialist society. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are doing a very glorious and great cause that our ancestors have never done." The responsibility of each of us is heavy, and our experience is not enough, we must work diligently, and at the same time, we must have the spirit of not fearing difficulties, persevering, and striving for revolutionary victory as in the past. We have the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the policies of the state towards domestic and foreign affairs are correct. As long as the people of all ethnic groups in the country, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all patriotic people unite and strive hard, we will definitely be able to successfully complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country.

    中华人民共和国国务院向第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提出关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的议案，我现在代表国务院向本次大会作关于第一个五年计划的报告。
    中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，是在中国共产党中央委员会和毛泽东主席的直接领导下编制完成的。一九五五年三月间经过中国共产党的全国代表会议讨论并基本通过。党的中央委员会根据党的全国代表会议讨论的意见作了修改之后，把这个计划草案提交国务院。国务院会议对这个五年计划草案加以讨论并一致通过，现在请求第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议予以审议和通过。
    我国第一个五年计划是在国民经济已经恢复的基础上开始实行的。全国解放之前，我国国民经济受到了帝国主义和国民党反动派的残酷掠夺和严重破坏，人民的生活痛苦不堪。人民的大革命推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，把原来由帝国主义和官僚买办资产阶级垄断的大银行、大工业、大商业和铁路等经济命脉变成全民的财产，把地主的土地所有制变成农民的土地所有制，这就使我国人民有可能来迅速地创造自己的新生活。在中华人民共和国成立以后的三年中间，依靠工人阶级和广大人民群众在劳动战线上的高度的积极性和创造性，依靠全国人民在改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、进行“三反”“五反”等各个战线上的胜利，依靠中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确的经济政策的领导，同时还由于伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的支援，我们胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作。在一九五二年，即我国结束经济恢复阶段的这一年，我国工业农业总产值（包括工业、手工业、农业和农村副业的全部产值，这种产值都是按一九五二年的不变价格计算的，下同），比一九四九年增长了百分之七十七点五，其中：现代工业增长了百分之一百七十八点六，农业
  （包括农村副业）增长了百分之四十八点五。一九五二年，工业和农业的主要产品的产量，除个别的以外，都超过了解放前的最高水平。由于现代工业的恢复和发展比较快，它的产值在工业农业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之十七上升到一九五二年的百分之二十六点七。在工业农业生产恢复和发展的同时，运输和邮电有了相应的恢复和发展。国家在平衡财政收支和稳定物价这些方面所取得的重大成就，对于国民经济的迅速恢复和人民生活的改善，起了显著的作用。
    在恢复时期中，我们已经开始进行了国民经济的改造工作。社会主义经济成份逐步地加强了它在国民经济中的领导地位。在这个时期，公私工业都有发展，但国营工业的发展速度远远超过了私营工业，私营工业中的一部分已经转变为公私合营，因而国营、合作社营和公私合营的工业的产值，在工业总产值（包括现代工业和工场手工业的产值，不包括合作化手工业和个体手工业的产值）中所占的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之三十六点七上升到一九五二年的百分之六十一，而私营工业的产值所占的比重，则由一九四九年的百分之六十三点三下降为一九五二年的百分之三十九。同时期内，农业的互助合作运动也有了初步的发展。一九五二年，国营商业和合作社营商业在国内商业批发中的比重达到百分之六十三，在社会零售中的比重达到百分之三十四，对外贸易已由国家管制。总的说来，社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导作用和领导地位，随着我国人民民主专政的日益巩固，已经在恢复时期大大地加强起来，因而也就大大地为我国实行计划经济开辟了道路，并需要我们着手制定发展国民经济的长期计划。
    苏联的真诚的、无私的、兄弟般的援助，是我国能够迅速地进行有计划的经济建设的重要条件。苏联政府和苏联人民帮助我国设计新企业和供应我国建设所需的设备，以及对我国的其他一系列的援助，表现了最伟大的和最崇高的国际主义。正如斯大林所说的：“问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    我国的第一个五年计划的期间是从一九五三年到一九五七年。这个计划草案的编制工作，在一九五一年就已经开始，中间经过多次的补充和修正，到一九五五年二月，即在第一个五年计划执行了两年之后，才编制完毕。这是由于我国资源缺乏调查，统计资料也很少，有多种经济成份同时并存，我们又没有编制长期计划的经验，建设工作的经验又很不够。而且，从国家的整个情况来说，一九五○年开始的抗美援朝战争，到一九五三年七月底才实现了停战。苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六个工业单位中的主要部分——第二批九十一个单位，也到一九五三年五月才确定。所有这些，都说明了过去两年，只能一面进行建设，一面编制长期计划。虽然如此，但由于我国在一九五二年已经完成了国民经济的恢复工作，从一九五三年起我们已经能够每年编制和执行发展国民经济的年度计划，苏联帮助我国建设的第一批五十个单位，早在一九五○年就已经确定并陆续施工，所以我们在建设方面并没有丧失时间。而且正因为我们进行了许多准备工作，在执行两个年度计划的过程中又取得了不少的经验，这就使我国第一个五年计划更加接近实际，更加能够保证它的胜利完成。
    现在，我谨对我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划作如下的说明。
      一、国家在过渡时期的总任务
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是根据中国共产党中央一九五二年提出的党在过渡时期的总路线、亦即国家在过渡时期的总任务而制定的。
    中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，包括新民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段。中国革命第一阶段的任务，是由工人阶级领导人民大众，推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，变半殖民地半封建的社会为新民主主义的社会，这个任务已经胜利地完成了。中华人民共和国的成立，标志着中国革命第一阶段的基本结束和中国革命第二阶段的开始。中国革命第二阶段的任务，就是要在中国建设社会主义社会。
    根据马克思列宁主义的学说，无论在什么国家，社会主义社会都不是一下子可以建成的，无产阶级在推翻了反动统治、取得革命胜利以后，到社会主义社会建成之前，都要经过一个过渡时期。列宁指出，无产阶级在取得政权之后，必须利用自己政治上的统治地位来解决社会主义的经济任务。要解决社会主义的经济任务，就不仅要发展以重工业为基础的工业体系，而且要把包括农业在内的国民经济转移到大生产的技术基础上来，把包括多种经济成份的国民经济改变成为单一的社会主义经济。
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央根据列宁关于过渡时期的学说，总结了中华人民共和国成立以来的经验，在一九五二年提出了党在过渡时期的总路线。中国共产党中央提出的党在过渡时期的总路线，在一九五四年已经被第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所接受，列入了我国的宪法，作为国家在过渡时期的总任务。宪法序言规定：“从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义社会建成，这是一个过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”宪法第四条又规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”
  我国建设社会主义的事业，是以社会主义工业化为主体的，而对农业、手工业的改造和对资本主义工商业的改造是两个必要的组成部分，这三者是不可分割的。
    大工业是建立社会主义社会的物质基础。列宁一再地指示说：“建立社会主义社会的真正的和唯一的基础，只有一个，这就是大工业。”没有大工业我们就不可能过渡到社会主义，就不可能在现代技术的基础上来改造农业和整个国民经济。
    大家知道：我国曾经是一个在帝国主义统治下的殖民地、半殖民地和半封建的国家，经济是很落后的。在解放前，我国现代工业在国民经济中只占很小的比重，而且主要是一些轻工业，这些轻工业很多还是依赖于外国进口原料的加工工业，至于重工业的基础则更加薄弱，虽然也有某些重工业，大多只是帝国主义国家在中国的机械修理厂，或者只是为帝国主义国家提供原料和半成品的矿山和工厂。我国这种因为缺乏重工业的基础而造成的国民经济十分落后的状况，使我国百余年来国弱民穷，受尽各帝国主义列强的侵略压迫。以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派统治中国二十多年，极大地加深了我国这种落后的状况。他们只顾穷凶极恶地掠夺人民，没有建立起什么工业。他们在一个很长的时间内曾经大肆吹嘘要建立一个什么年产十万吨的钢铁厂，一年又一年地过去了，他们的家族越来越惊人地富了，但是结果连一个这样小规模的钢铁厂也建立不起来。直到抗日战争爆发以前，全国除东北外每年只生产钢四万吨左右，而且都是满清末年和北洋军阀统治时代所建立的钢铁厂的产品。日本帝国主义在侵占了我国的东北以后，特别是在一九三九年到一九四三年，为了掠夺资源，扩大侵略战争，曾经在那里扩建了一些钢铁工业，那些当然是附属于日本本国工业系统的纯粹殖民地式的工业，而且许多工厂和矿山在以后又被国民党反动派所严重地破坏了。事实正如毛泽东主席在一九四五年“论联合政府”一书中所说的：“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”全国解放以后，人民掌握了政权，这样一个独立、自由、民主和统一的新中国出现了，一个工业化的新中国也就在望。这样的新中国是中国人民在工人阶级领导下长期流血斗争得来的，因此，国家工业化的道路只能是社会主义的工业化。只有社会主义的工业化，才能克服我国现在先进的政权和落后的经济之间的矛盾，而把贫弱的中国变成真正富强的中国。
    社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是优先发展重工业。只有建立起强大的重工业，即建立起现代化的钢铁工业、机器制造工业、电力工业、燃料工业、有色金属工业、基本化学工业等等，我们才可能制造现代化的各种工业设备，使重工业本身和轻工业得到技术的改造；我们才可能供给农业以拖拉机和其他现代化的农业机械，供给农业以足够的肥料，使农业得到技术的改造；我们才可能生产现代化的交通工具，如火车头、汽车、轮船、飞机等等，使运输业得到技术的改造；我们也才可能制造现代化的武器，来装备保卫祖国的战士，使国防更加巩固。同时，只有在发展重工业的基础上，我们才能够显著地提高生产技术，提高劳动生产率，能够不断地增加农业和消费品工业的生产，保证人民的生活水平的不断提高。由此可见，优先发展重工业的政策，是使国家富强和人民幸福的唯一正确的政策，实行这个政策，将为我国建立起社会主义的强大的物质基础。有人认为：我国所处的国际环境不同于苏联革命胜利后的情况，我们现在有了苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助，何必急于工业化呢？我们认为这种说法是错误的。我们在国内面对着国民经济的落后状态，在国外还有凶恶的帝国主义的包围，不实行社会主义工业化，就不仅不能使我国建成社会主义社会，并且有使我国不能抵御帝国主义的侵略、不能保持经济上和政治上的独立的危险。由此可见，在中国实现社会主义工业化，发展国民经济，是中国人民自己应该担当的责任；苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的帮助，是我国实现社会主义工业化的有利条件，我们在这种条件下只应该更加努力建设，为加速实现社会主义工业化的任务而斗争。
    建设社会主义，必须解决小农经济同社会主义工业化之间的矛盾。社会主义不可能建立在小农经济的基础上，而只能建立在大工业经济和集体大农业经济的基础上。社会主义工业化要求农业从分散的落后的生产方式转变为集体的先进的生产方式，在集体化和机械化的基础上生产更多的粮食和工业原料，同时也要求个体手工业走向合作化的道路。广大的农民要最后摆脱贫穷和痛苦，也必须离开过去长期所走惯了的小生产的旧道路，而转向集体化和机械化的社会主义农业的新道路。因此，我们必须对农业和手工业实行社会主义改造，即根据宪法第八、第九两条规定，鼓励个体农民根据自愿的原则组织生产合作、供销合作和信用合作，鼓励个体手工业者和其他非农业的个体劳动者根据自愿的原则组织生产合作和供销合作。有人认为：中国农民在改革土地制度以后，已经分得了土地，生产积极性很高，何必实行合作化呢？我们认为这种说法也是错误的。封建土地制度的改革，这还只是农民解放的第一步，因为他们仍然分散地耕种着小块土地，不能使用现代化的农业机器，就不能进一步发展生产和抵御自然灾害，也就不能避免城乡资本主义的剥削，当然更不用说遇到严重的自然灾害和发生意外的事故了。只有使农业和手工业从个体经营逐步地转变为集体经营，并在这个基础上用现代技术装备起来的时候，才能大大地发展农业的生产力，扩大农业的再生产，提高生产量，以适应国家的社会主义工业化的要求，也才能限制以至消灭资本主义发展的基础，使广大农民和手工业者永远摆脱贫穷和痛苦，而得到普遍富裕的生活。
    建设社会主义，当然必须解决资本主义经济同社会主义经济之间的矛盾。资本主义的生产资料私有制妨碍着我国生产力的进一步发展，资本主义经济的无政府状态同社会主义经济的有计划发展是互相对立的。随着国民经济的发展和实现计划领导，资本主义经济同社会主义经济之间的矛盾就更加显著和尖锐起来。因此，我们必须对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，即根据宪法第十条规定：“国家对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制和改造的政策。国家通过国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，利用资本主义工商业的有利于国计民生的积极作用，限制它们的不利于国计民生的消极作用，鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。”有人希望社会主义经济和资本主义经济长时期地在一个国家里并存，希望对资本主义工商业不要实行社会主义改造，或者现在还不要实行社会主义改造。我们认为这种想法也是错误的。社会主义和资本主义这两种相反的生产关系，在一个国家里互不干扰地平行发展是不可能的。不走社会主义的路，就要走资本主义的路，而后面这条路，是中国人民所决不许可的。走社会主义的路，是我国历史发展的必然规律。在我国目前的政治和经济的具体条件下，经过国家资本主义的各种形式来改造资本主义工商业，使之逐步地转变为社会主义企业，不但是必要的，而且是可能的，这已经由过去五年的实际经验所证明。
    上述种种，说明我国为着建设社会主义，必须积极地实现社会主义工业化，同时实现对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，但是，是不是说，社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的事业，我们可以在第一个五年计划期间就全部完成呢？不是的。根据马克思列宁主义的学说，应该把向社会主义的过渡看做是一个历史时期。我国是一个大国，情况是复杂的，国民经济原来又很落后，有一亿一千多万农户的小农经济，有很大数量的手工业，而且资本主义工商业在国民经济中还占相当大的比重。因此，我国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的工作很艰巨很繁重，也就需要比较长的时间。按照我国的实际情况，完成这个过渡时期的总任务，除了恢复时期的三年以外，大概还需要十五年左右的时间，即大概需要三个五年计划。正如毛泽东主席的指示：我们经过十五年左右的紧张工作和刻苦建设，可能在基本上建成社会主义社会，但要建成一个强大的高度社会主义工业化的国家，就需要几十年的努力，譬如说，要有四、五十年的时间，即本世纪的整个下半世纪。
      我国在建设社会主义的过程中，在进行社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的时候，都应该按照我国当前的实际情况，采取切实可行的办法，逐步地实现。在工业建设中，必须根据资金和技术力量的可能，贯彻重点建设的方针来进行建设，那种不分轻重缓急，认为要建设就应该处处大规模和样样现代化，这种想法和做法，对实现社会主义工业化是有害的。建设一个现代化的重工业企业，一般都要有五年左右的时间，要进行一系列的繁重的工作，要有各个方面的配合；我们要建设起很多用现代技术装备起来的工业企业，才能达到工业化，那能希望在一个短时期内，不费什么力气就建设成功呢？农业和手工业的合作化也不可能在短时期内轻易完成，这是关系到几万万农民和成千万手工业者的生产方式和生活方式的根本改革的大事情，要使劳动农民和手工业者彻底摆脱个体的小生产的道路，而转向一条新的社会主义发展大道，这就必须经过相当长期的艰苦工作，通过一些必要的过渡形式，才能逐步地完成。实现农业和手工业的合作化，不仅需要整个经济发展能够帮助农业和手工业，也不仅需要农民和手工业者有文化知识，而且还需要有农民和手工业者的亲身经验，所有这一切都是需要时间的。对资本主义工商业的改造，同样也应该通过一些必要的过渡形式逐步地完成。
   我们已经赢得了一个新中国，我们必须加紧努力进行经济建设来保护和巩固这个新中国，这个建设主要的就是社会主义工业化的建设。列宁在十月革命前夜曾经对俄国人民指出：“或是灭亡，或是把本身命运信托于最革命的阶级，以便最迅速地和最急进地过渡到更高的生产方式。”在中国，问题也是这样。毛泽东主席在解放前说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”我们不能只是依靠落后的小农经济过生活，我们也必须抛弃使广大群众倾家荡产的资本主义的道路。解放了的中国人民，要避免在自己前进道路上的各种危险，只有努力实现社会主义工业化的事业，并在这个基础上按照社会主义的原则逐步地改造我国的个体农业、个体手工业和资本主义工商业。在过渡时期，我们就是要解决这种任务，而根据我们在恢复时期和五年计划前两年所已取得的成就，我们是有充分信心来解决这样的任务的。二、第一个五年计划概要
    我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务提出的。第一个五年计划的基本任务，概括地说来，就是：集中主要力量进行以苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个单位为中心的、由限额以上的六百九十四个建设单位组成的工业建设，建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础；发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，并发展手工业生产合作社，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；基本上把资本主义工商业分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。
    我国第一个五年计划是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个重大的步骤。第一个五年计划的建设规模是很大的，国民经济各部门的发展速度是很快的。
    在五年内，全国经济建设和文化教育建设的支出总数为七百六十六亿四千万元，折合黄金七万万两以上。用这样大量的资金来进行国家建设，这在中国的过去历史上，完全是不可想像的，只有在工人阶级领导下的、全心全意为人民的利益而工作的政府，才可能来这样做。
    在五年经济建设和文化教育建设的支出总数中，属于基本建设投资的是四百二十七亿四千万元，占支出总数的百分之五十五点八。其他的百分之四十四点二，即三百三十九亿元；一部分用于基本建设所需要的资源勘探、工程勘测、工程设计和器材储备等；一部分用于发展工业生产和运输交通，如设备大修理、技术组织措施、新种类产品试制、零星固定资产购置等；一部分是各经济部门的流动资金；再有一部分是经济和文化教育各部门的事业用费和培养专业干部用费。五年基本建设的投资四百二十七亿四千万元，是这样分配的：工业部门为二百四十八亿五千万元，占百分之五十八点二；农业、林业和水利部门为三十二亿六千万元，占百分之七点六；运输和邮电部门为八十二亿一千万元，占百分之十九点二；贸易、银行和物资储备部门为十二亿八千万元，占百分之三；文化、教育和卫生部门为三十亿八千万元，占百分之七点二； 城市公用事业建设为十六亿元，占百分之三点七；其他为四亿六千万元，占百分之一点一。从上列的基本建设投资的分配比例可以看出，投资的重点是工业。同样可以看出，投资的分配也已照顾到工业以外的其他各部门事业发展的需要。我国第一个五年计划农业方面国家投资的比例不算大，这是因为五年内农业还不可能广泛地实现机械化，更大规模的水利建设和林业建设也还不可能全面展开；同时，农业、林业和水利部门的基本建设投资额并没有包括农村救灾费、农业贷款等项，更没有包括农民自己投入生产的资金。如果把这几笔钱都算进去，则五年内为发展农业的资金总数将接近于工业的投资数字。我国第一个五年计划运输方面的投资比例也不算大，但在基本上可以保证第一个五年计划期间和第二个五年计划初期的需要。五年内我国工业基本建设的新建和改建的单位，包括苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六个单位在内，在限额以上（注）的有六百九十四个，加上农业、林业、水利方面的二百五十二个，运输交通和邮电方面的二百二十个，文化、教育、卫生方面的一百五十六个，城市公用事业方面的一百十八个，其他方面的一百六十个，全部限额以上的基本建设单位共有一千六百个。除了限额以上的基本建设单位以外，还有限额以下的建设单位六千多个，其中工业方面约有二千三百个。限额以上的建设单位，能够在五年内建设完成的，工业方面有四百五十五个，加上其他方面共有一千二百七十一个；限额以下的建设单位，绝大多数可以完成。这些建设单位的完成，就将大大地提高我国工业的生产力，推动农业的发展，增长运输能力，扩大文化教育事业。（注）国家为着便于管理和掌握重大的基本建设单位，按照我国的具体情况，规定出各类基
    本建设单位的投资限额。凡一个建设单位，不论其为新建、改建或恢复，它的全部投
    资额大于限额者，即是限额以上的建设单位；小于限额者，即是限额以下的建设单位。
    例如，在工业中，各类工业基本建设单位的投资限额规定如下：钢铁工业、汽车制造
    工业、拖拉机制造工业、船舶制造工业、机车车辆制造工业的投资限额为一千万元；
    有色金属工业、化学工业、水泥工业的投资限额为六百万元；电站、输电线路和变电
    所、煤炭采掘工业、石油开采工业、石油加工工业、除交通机械以外的机器制造工业、
    汽车和船舶的修配工业、纺织（包括印染）工业的投资限额为五百万元；橡胶工业、造
    纸工业、造糖工业、卷烟工业、医药工业的投资限额为四百万元；陶瓷工业、除制糖
    以外的食品工业、其他各项轻工业的投资限额为三百万元。以工业说，包括限额以上和限额以下的建设单位在内，其主要工业品的建设规模和五年内增加的年产能力的数字如下列：
    铁：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为五百七十五万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为二百八十万吨。
  钢：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为六百一十万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为二百五十三万吨。
    电：全部建成后增加的发电能力将为四百零六万瓩，五年内增加的发电能力为二百零五万瓩。
  原煤：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为九千三百一十万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为五千三百八十五万吨。
  冶金机械和矿山机械：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为十九万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为七万吨。
    发电设备：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为八十万瓩，五年内建成。
    汽车：全部建成后的年产能力将为九万辆，五年内达到的年产能力为三万辆。
    拖拉机：全部建成后的年产能力将为一万五千辆，一九五九年建成。
    化学肥料：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为九十一万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为二十八万吨。
    水泥：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为三百六十万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为二百三十六万吨。
    棉纺锭：全部建成后增加的纺锭将为一百八十九万枚，五年内投入生产的纺锭为一百六十五万枚。机制纸：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为十八万六千吨，五年内增加的年产能力为九万五千吨。机制糖：全部建成后增加的年产能力将为五十六万吨，五年内增加的年产能力为四十二万八千吨。
    以运输业说，五年内新建成的铁路干线和支线共四千公里以上，加上恢复铁路、改建铁路、新建复线、延长车站站线、工业和其他的专用线，则增加的铁路总长度约为一万公里。五年内修建公路一万公里以上，新增加的通车里程为七千一百公里以上。五年内新增轮船四十万载重吨。
    以农业和水利说，五年内将新建国营机械化农场九十一个，拖拉机站一百九十四个。五年内除建设十三个大型水库外，修浚河道的土石方工程就有十三亿立方公尺，并将开始进行黄河的治本工程。
    五年内，包括工厂厂房、工人职员宿舍、学校、医院等在内的房屋建筑面积，约有一亿五千万平方公尺。
    工业建设是我国第一个五年计划的中心，而在苏联援助下的一百五十六个工业单位的建设，又是工业建设的中心。苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六个工业单位，在第一个五年计划期间开始施工的是一百四十五个单位，其他十一个单位在第一个五年计划期间进行勘察和设计，将在第二个五年计划期间进行施工。这些工业建设单位，规模大，技术新，许多是我国工业史上完全崭新的创举。例如：
    鞍山钢铁联合企业在原有生产规模的基础上，从一九五三年到一九六○年这八年时间内，将基本上完成以下四十八个主要工程的改建和新建：三个铁矿，八个选矿厂和烧结厂，六座自动化的炼铁高炉，三个新式的炼钢厂，十六个轧钢厂，十座炼焦炉，二个耐火材料车间。这些厂矿和车间的改建和新建，都将尽可能地利用苏联最新的技术成就。这个我国最大的钢铁联合企业，在改建完成以后，它的生产规模可以扩大到年产生铁二百五十万吨，钢三百二十二万吨，钢材二百四十八万吨。它所生产的各种规格的钢材、钢板和钢管，可以基本上供应国内在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划初期制造火车头、轮船、汽车、拖拉机等等的需要；它所生产的各种规格的钢轨，每年可以用来铺设三千多公里的铁路。
    在改建鞍山钢铁联合企业的同时，将进行武汉和包头两个钢铁联合企业的建设。
    五年内进行建设的电站，发电能力在五万瓩以上的火力发电站就有十五个；丰满水电站在改建完成后，发电能力可以达到五十六万瓩以上。这些建设单位的完成，将大大地加强各地区的电力供应能力。
    五年内进行建设的煤矿企业，设计能力（包括原有的生产能力在内）在年产煤一百万吨以上的就有三十一个。其中五个最大的煤矿企业在一九五七年将达到的年产能力如下：抚顺矿务局所属煤矿为九百三十万吨，阜新矿务局所属煤矿为八百四十五万吨，开滦煤矿为九百六十八万吨，大同矿务局所属煤矿为六百四十五万吨，淮南矿务局所属煤矿为六百八十五万吨。五年内建设并完工的第一汽车制造厂，在它发挥了生产能力以后，每年能够出产载重汽车三万辆，供应运输业的需要。设计能力比第一汽车制造厂大一倍的第二汽车制造厂，也将在第一个五年计划期间开始建设。这两个汽车制造厂将为我国建立汽车制造工业的基础。
    五年内开始建设的拖拉机制造厂，在第二个五年计划期间建设完成后，我国将能够每年出产五十四匹马力的拖拉机一万五千台，供应农业的需要。
    五年内开始建设的二个重型机器制造厂（其中一个是苏联帮助设计的，一个是我国自己设计的），在建设完成后，按照设计能力，它们的产品每年可以装备一个年产一百六十万吨钢的钢铁联合企业，供应炼铁、炼钢、轧钢和炼焦的全套设备。
    五年内开始建设的制造发电设备的工厂，在它们全部建设完成后，我国就能够制造每台容量一万二千瓩、二万五千瓩以至五万瓩的发电设备，供应国民经济各部门建设电站的需要。
    我国许多轻工业工厂是由国内自己设计和建设的，许多工厂的规模也是相当巨大的。例如在我国首都北京建设的三个棉纺织厂，共装备纺锭二十三万枚，织机七千多台。五年内进行建设的规模较大的纺织厂，共有三十九个。
    不只是许多工业建设单位的规模是很巨大的，许多铁路、公路、水利等等的建设单位的规模也是很巨大的。例如：
    五年内进行建设的贯通甘肃和新疆的兰新铁路，贯通西北和西南的宝鸡到成都的铁路，贯通江西和福建的鹰潭到厦门的铁路，连结我国和蒙古人民共和国及苏联的集宁到二连的铁路，不仅线路很长，而且它们或者要经过沙漠地带，或者要穿过高山峻岭，建设工程都是很浩大的。
    五年内继续进行建设并已在一九五四年通车的康藏公路和青藏公路，全长共有四千三百多公里，它们都是在人烟稀少的拔海几千公尺的高山上开拓出来的，建设工程是特别艰巨的。五年内继续进行建设的淮河根治工程，计划建成南湾、薄山、佛子岭、梅山等四个大型水库，共可蓄水三十八亿立方公尺以上；同时对洪河、汝河、濉河、北淝河等主要支流进行防洪排涝工程。在一九五四年已经建设完成的官厅水库，可蓄水二十三亿立方公尺，对免除永定河下游的水患将起重大的作用。
      五年内将开始进行黄河的根治和综合开发工作。黄河全长四千八百多公里，流经七省，流域面积七十四万五千平方公里，在我国历史上一直就是为害最严重的河道。根据黄河的综合利用的规划方案，在黄河中下游及其主要支流将修建水坝几十座，在三门峡等五处将建设足以调节流量的巨大水库，并建设巨大的水力发电站。在第一个五年计划期间，黄河的根治和综合开发工作将完成流域规划，并开始建设三门峡的水利、水力枢纽工程。
    在苏联直接帮助下建设的国营友谊农场，将开垦荒地三十七万五千亩。这个农场拥有由苏联赠送的大批现代化的机械设备，它将在我国今后农业机械化的发展道路上起重要的示范和带头的作用。
    在苏联的直接帮助下，五年内我国将开始和平利用原子能的建设，使之为国民经济服务。
       上面所举的一些例子，已经足以说明，我们正在做着为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事。完成我国第一个五年计划所规定的工业建设和其他建设的任务，对推进我国社会主义工业化并从而改变我国经济落后的面貌，无疑将起极其重大的作用。这种社会主义的经济建设，代表着中国人民整体的长远的利益和最高的利益。
    在第一个五年计划期间，由于原有工业企业的生产能力的发挥，加上新建和改建的工业企业投入生产，将使我国工业生产力有很大的提高。到一九五七年，现代工业在工业农业总产值中的比重，将由一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升到百分之三十六。
    一九五七年比一九五二年，我国工业总产值将增长百分之九十八点三，即平均每年递增百分之十四点七。其中，现代工业增长百分之一百零四点一，即平均每年递增百分之十五点三。我国这种工业发展速度，无疑是比较高的，在资本主义国家是没有的，也是不可能有的。
    五年内，我国各种工业产品的产量都将有显著的增长，主要产品在一九五七年的计划产量比一九五二年的产量增长的情况如下列：钢：从一百三十五万吨增加到四百十二万吨，增长二点一倍。发电量：从七十二亿六千万度增加到一百五十九亿度，增长一点二倍。原煤：从六千三百五十三万吨增加到一亿一千三百万吨，增长零点八倍。发电机：从三万瓩增加到二十二万七千瓩，增长六点七倍。电动机：从六十四万瓩增加到一百零五万瓩，增长零点六倍。载重汽车：达到四千辆（一九五二年还不能制造）。水泥：从二百八十六万吨增加到六百万吨，增长一点一倍。机制纸：从三十七万吨增加到六十五万吨，增长零点八倍。棉布：从一亿一千一百六十三万匹增加到一亿六千三百七十二万匹，增长零点五倍。机制糖：从二十四万九千吨增加到六十八万六千吨，增长一点八倍。
    或者有人认为：我国在第一个五年计划完成之后，钢的产量仍然不过四百多万吨，不仅远远落后于美国和英国，而且也落后于日本，这和中国作为一个大国这样的地位相称吗？我们认为：这只看到事情的一面，没有看到事情的另一面。美国、英国、日本这些国家，以及其他工业比较发达的国家，它们工业发展的历史已有一两百年，少的也将近一百年，我国工业发展的历史比它们落后了一百多年，或者几十年，仅仅在人民掌握了国家政权以后，才有可能有计划地进行建设。我国在一九○七年，才建设起一个汉阳钢铁厂，当年的钢产量只有八千五百多吨。到一九三三年，全国钢产量也只有二万五千吨。一九三六年全国钢产量超过四十万吨，但其中三十六万四千吨是由当时在日本帝国主义侵占下的东北生产的。我国历史上钢铁生产的最高年份是一九四三年，出产生铁一百八十万吨，钢九十万吨，而其中绝大部分是在日本侵占下的东北。由于蒋介石反动派的破坏，在中华人民共和国成立的这一年，即一九四九年，全国生铁产量只有二十四万六千吨，钢产量只有十五万八千多吨。由此可见，我们承受的是旧中国极其可怜的遗产。在全国解放以后，中国共产党和中国人民才把改变中国经济和文化落后的艰巨任务担当起来，在短短三年时间内使国民经济得到恢复并有一些发展，接着又将在五年时间内使工业生产提高一倍。我们没有“封神榜”上那种呼风唤雨的本领，那能用五年时间就赶上工业发达的资本主义国家？斯大林曾经说过：“决不可把工业发展速度和工业发展水平混为一谈”。我们工业发展的速度将是很快的，可是就工业发展的水平来说，在相当时期内，我们比一些资本主义国家将还是落后的，因此，我们必须赶上去。我们可以确定地说，赶上它们，或者赶过它们的工业水平，并不需要一百年，有几十年的时间就够了。我们仅仅用了五年的时间，就赶过中国反动统治时代的几十年，这样的工业发展速度难道还慢吗？
    我国要实现的国家工业化，是社会主义的工业化，是以苏联为榜样并在苏联和各人民民主国家直接帮助下的工业化，而不是资本主义的工业化，所以我国工业——特别是制造生产资料的工业部门就能够有很高速度的发展。按照第一个五年计划的规定，在工业基本建设投资中，制造生产资料工业的投资占百分之八十八点八；制造消费资料工业的投资占百分之十一点二。同时，按照计划，五年内生产资料的产值将增长百分之一百二十六点五，消费资料的产值则增长百分之七十九点七，因此，生产资料的产值在工业总产值中所占的比重，将由一九五二年的百分之三十九点七到一九五七年上升为百分之四十五点四，消费资料的产值所占的比重，将由一九五二年的百分之六十点三到一九五七年下降为百分之五十四点六。
    社会主义工业和资本主义工业的生产增长的比例的变化，也表现着我国工业发展的社会主义的特点。五年内国营工业的产值增长将为百分之一百三十点一；合作社营工业和五年计划前已有的公私合营工业的发展速度也很快；私营工业的产值在五年内将有一半要转变为公私合营。因此，到一九五七年，在全国工业总产值中，国营、合作社营（包括供销合作社和消费合作社的加工工厂，不包括手工业生产合作社）和公私合营的工业产值所占的比重将上升为百分之八十七点八，私营工业产值所占的比重将下降为百分之十二点二，而且其中的主要部分将接受国家的加工定货，基本上纳入国家资本主义的轨道。
    第一个五年计划对农业规定了适当的增产指标。五年内，农业及其副业的总产值增长百分之二十三点三，即平均每年递增百分之四点三。
    按照计划，主要农业产品一九五七年的计划产量及其比一九五二年增长的情况如下列：粮食：达到三千八百五十六亿斤，增长百分之十七点六。棉花：达到三千二百七十万担，增长百分之二十五点四。黄麻、洋麻：达到七百三十万担，增长百分之十九点七。烤烟：达到七百八十万担，增长百分之七十六点六。甘蔗：达到二百六十三亿斤，增长百分之八十五点一。甜菜：达到四十二亿七千万斤，增长百分之三百四十六点四。
    油料作物：以播种面积计算达到一亿一千八百万亩，增长百分之三十七点八。
    克服农业的发展过分落后于工业发展的矛盾，是五年计划的一个重大任务。我国在国民党反动派统治时期，农业生产不仅没有发展，相反地还受了严重的破坏。一九三六年的粮食产量是三千亿斤，此后差不多年年下降，到一九四九年，粮食产量只有二千二百六十亿斤，棉花产量只有八百八十多万担。解放以后，仅仅经过三年的时间，我国在一九五二年的粮食产量就达到三千二百七十八亿斤，棉花产量达到二千六百万担，都超过了解放前的最高年产量。五年农业计划又在一九五二年的基数上再提高到上列数量，这在我国目前的具体条件下，农业发展的速度是不能算很低的，应该努力完成并争取超额完成。
    农业生产合作社是第一个五年计划期间农业增产的基础，也是改造小农经济的必由之路。到一九五七年，参加现有的初级形式的农业生产合作社的农户，在全国农户总数中的比重，将达到三分之一左右。
      适应于工业农业生产的发展和人民对交通的需要，运输和邮电在第一个五年计划期间也将有相应的发展。到一九五七年，铁路货物周转量将达到一千二百一十亿吨公里，即比一九五二年增长一倍；旅客周转量将达到三百二十亿人公里，增长百分之五十九点五。内河轮驳船货物周转量将达到一百五十三亿吨公里，即比一九五二年增长三点二倍；旅客周转量将达到三十四亿人公里，增长百分之七十八点七。沿海轮驳船货物周转量将达到五十七亿五千万吨浬，即比一九五二年增长一点九倍；旅客周转量将达到二亿四千万人浬，增长将近一点四倍。公路汽车货物周转量将达到三十二亿吨公里，即比一九五二年增长三点七倍；旅客周转量将达到五十七亿人公里，增长将近二倍。民用航空货物周转量将达到八百零五万吨公里，即比一九五二年增长二点三倍。邮路总长度将达到一百九十七万公里，即比一九五二年增长百分之四十五点二；其他邮电业务，也将有相当的发展。
    在上述工业农业发展以及各种比重变化的基础上，一九五七年全国社会商品零售总额将达到四百九十八亿元左右，比一九五二年增长百分之八十左右。其中：国营商业约增长百分之一百三十三点二，合作社营商业约增长百分之二百三十九点五。原有私营商业在五年内经过社会主义改造，将有半数上下转变为各种国家资本主义形式的商业和由小商小贩组织起来的合作形式的小商业，这两部分商业和私营商业的零售额合并计算，在五年内仍将有所增长。到一九五七年，在社会零售总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业将占百分之五十四点九，各种国家资本主义形式的商业和合作形式的小商业将占百分之二十四，私营商业将占百分之二十一点一。
    五年内文化、教育和科学研究的事业将有相当的发展。一九五七年同一九五二年比较，高等学校在校学生的人数将增长百分之一百二十七，在一九五七年达到四十三万四千人；高级中学在校学生的人数将增长百分之一百七十八，在一九五七年达到七十二万四千人；初级中学在校学生的人数将增长百分之七十八点六，在一九五七年达到三百九十八万三千人；小学学生的人数将增长百分之十八，在一九五七年达到六千零二十三万人，即占全国学龄儿童的百分之七十以上。五年内科学研究事业将有较大的发展，只是中国科学院所属的研究机构即将增加二十三所，研究人员将增加三千四百人。在出版、广播、文学艺术、电影、社会文化等方面，五年内也都有不同程度的比较快的发展。
    五年计划对人民物质生活水平的提高作了适当的规定。五年内，就业人数共增加约四百二十万人，工人职员的平均工资以货币计算约增长百分之三十三；国营企业和国家机关所支付的劳动保险基金、医药费、福利费和文化教育费将共达五十亿元以上；国家拨款为工人职员建筑的住宅，将约达四千六百万平方公尺。五年内，农村人民的生活将逐步地得到改善，随着生产的发展和商品化程度的提高，购买力将增长近一倍。国家将拨付一定数量的款项，救济因受灾而在生产上和生活上发生困难的农民和其他劳动人民。人民保健事业有较大的发展，五年内病床将增长百分之七十七，医师人数将增加百分之七十四，中医师的力量将被发挥。
    谁都能够看到，实现第一个五年计划将使我国国民经济发生重大的变化。五年内，我国工业特别是重工业的迅速发展，将使我国的经济面貌开始发生变化，为我国的社会主义工业化建立初步的基础。五年内农业和手工业的合作化的迅速发展，将为农业和手工业的社会主义改造建立初步的基础。五年内资本主义工商业将经过公私合营、加工定货、代销经销等等方式而被逐步地纳入国家资本主义的轨道，为私营工商业的社会主义改造建立基础。这一切变化，无疑地将进一步地巩固我国的人民民主专政，进一步地加强我国的国防力量，并为进一步地改善我国各族人民的物质生活和文化生活创造条件。因此，第一个五年计划的胜利完成，是关系着我国国家命运和人民幸福的大事情。可以说，第一个五年计划是使我国繁荣富强和人民幸福的第一个计划，这个计划的实现，也将增强世界和平民主阵营的力量。
    我国在胜利地实现了第一个五年计划以后，当然还不可能解决国民经济发展的一切方面的任务。第一个五年计划开始建设的许多重要的建设工程，有的要在第二个五年计划期间才能建成，有的要在第二个五年计划期间才能在生产上起重要的作用。在第一个五年计划终结的时候，在工业方面，我国机器制造的能力和水平都还不可能满足国民经济各部门实行技术改造的需要，许多大型和精密的机器设备还不能制造，某些工业部门如石油工业的落后状况还不可能有很大的改变；同时，工业的地区分布，虽然在内地建设了不少新的工业企业，但还不能完全克服原来偏集于一方和沿海的不合理状态。在农业方面，对小农经济的社会主义改造只在三分之一左右的农户中实现了初级形式的合作化，大规模的技术改造还没有开始，农业发展落后于工业迅速发展的状况还不能完全改变。对资本主义经济的社会主义改造，也只是实行了第一步，还需要较长的时间，才能把它们改造成为社会主义经济。在文化方面，我国科学技术水平还落后于国民经济发展的要求，广大人民的文化水平还是不高的，并且还有相当大量的文盲存在。此外，旧中国遗留下来的失业现象，也还不可能完全消灭，剩余劳动力还不能得到充分利用。这些问题，都需要我们在第二个和第三个五年计划期间继续努力，加以解决。
    三、第一个五年计划的若干问题
        （一）关于工业和运输业的基本建设问题现在我想就关于工业和运输业的基本建设的以下问题作一些说明。这些问题就是基本建设的规模的大小问题，轻重工业投资的比重问题，大中小型企业的配合问题，工业的地区分布问题，基本建设的标准问题，保证工程的质量问题。
    第一，基本建设规模的大小问题。
    对于这个问题，在五年计划的编制过程中，我们曾经作过反复的考虑和多次的研究。我们认为在目前条件下，已经确定的建设规模是适当的，是五年内应当而且可以争取完成的。
    有人怀疑过这样的建设规模是否过大。他们的理由是：我国现在还是一个在经济上很落后和很贫穷的国家，国家财力有限，技术力量不足，资源情况很多不明，在五年内进行这样巨大规模的基本建设是不能胜任的。因此他们觉得可以把这个建设规模加以缩小。他们说不要搞得这样紧张，把任务减轻下来吧。他们又说“农民太苦”，慢一点搞工业化吧。我们不同意这样的主张。我们的理由正像我们在前面已经说过的：摆脱我国在经济上很落后的地位，除了加速工业的建设以外，并没有别的出路。同时，我们工业化的建设，也正是为着使农民有可能摆脱贫穷的状况。五年计划已经确定的工业建设单位，都是必需的，如果削减，就将延缓我国整个社会主义建设的速度，同时打乱国家的建设部署。
    我们国家的财力是不是有可能来适应这样的建设规模呢？我们答复这是可能的。其所以可能，就是因为我们的革命已经为我们提供了以下的积累来源：
      一、我国人民已经推翻了帝国主义者在中国的统治，帝国主义者已经不可能像过去那样掠夺我国人民的大量财富，这样就提供了我国建设的一个重要积累来源。
    二、我国人民推翻了封建主义，把地主的土地所有制变成了农民的土地所有制，农民过去要向地主交纳高额的地租，现在不再交纳了，农民用劳动的所得改善了自己的生活，同时也可以用其中的一部分帮助国家的建设。
    三、我国人民推翻了官僚资本主义，把官僚资本家的财产变成了全民的财产，现在工人已经不为官僚资本家的利润而生产，而是为国家和人民的需要而生产，这也是我国建设的重要积累来源。
    四、在私营工厂做工的工人，现在虽然仍旧要拿出一部分劳动成果作为资本家的利润，但是现在资本家只能得到法令所规定的适当的一部分利润。资本主义企业利润中相当大的一部分或则缴纳所得税，投入国家的建设；或则变为企业公积金，用于企业的扩大再生产；这在我们人民民主专政的条件下也是对于国家和人民有利的。
    所有这些都证明：我国并不是没有建设资金，而是以前大量资金都装进了帝国主义者、地主、资产阶级的腰包，只有人民革命胜利以后，我国人民才有可能把自己劳动所创造的资金，用于国家建设，为我们自己和我们的后代创造美好的将来。我们应该及时地和好好地来利用这种资金。
    说到技术力量不足和资源情况很多不明，这是不错的。可是难道我们不可以在苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助之下一面建设一面学习吗？难道我们不可以在建设中逐步地学会本领、逐步地摸清情况吗？毛泽东主席在“中国革命战争的战略问题”著作中说过：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。……革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”毛主席在这里说的是关于革命战争。可是要做好任何的人民事业，都是必须在实际中去学习，这却是普遍的真理。几年来的事实证明：我们在实际的建设中已经学会了不少事情，对于资源情况比以前也知道得多了。显然，等待并不能够增加我们的本领和知识。认为一切都必须“先学好了再干”，而因此主张削减五年建设的规模，打算减轻自己所应该担当并且能够担当的责任，这种主张是不能采取的。
    那末，基本建设规模能不能够更加扩大呢？
    按照我国的需要来说，无论是重工业、轻工业，无论是钢铁、有色金属、化学肥料、石油、机器、纺织等工业，五年计划草案规定的基本建设计划和生产计划，都还是不能满足国家的需要的。但是建设规模能否更加扩大，不但必须根据是否需要，而且必须根据是否可能。我们不是空想家，而是马克思列宁主义者。我们所以认为五年计划建设规模是适当的，削减它是不应该的，这就是因为按照我国现在客观的条件，实现它是可能的。而且，我们认为：在年度计划中，还可能适当地扩大一些必要的建设，例如煤矿、石油、铁路等等，我们已经在准备这样做。特别是我国的石油工业的产量很低，同需要的程度相差很远，我们必须努力地去找寻更多的石油资源和研究发展人造石油工业的办法，以便把石油工业的建设规模加以扩大。但这是不是说，我们可以不顾财政力量、技术力量和设备供应的各种可能的客观条件，而任意地、无限制地去扩大一切建设呢？当然，事情也不可以
  这样做。从财政力量方面说，五年内国家对经济建设和文化教育建设的支出已经达到七百
  六十六亿四千万元。从技术力量方面说，五年计划所已经规定建设的巨大的复杂的新企业都是苏联帮助设计的，我国的工程技术人员目前还缺乏条件来独立设计这样的新企业。从
  供应设备方面说，在我国机器制造工业目前还缺乏制造重要设备和复杂机件的能力的情况
  下，也难于增加很多设备的供应。根据这些条件，我们在五年内可能再扩大的建设，也还
  是有一定限度的。认为可以不顾可能的客观条件而无限制地扩大建设的规模，或者不注意
  最合理地和最有效地利用物力、人力和财力，而无把握地去处处动手，这些都是错误的。
      反对右的保守主义，也反对“左”的冒险主义。这就是我们关于基本建设规模大小问
  题的结论。
    第二，轻重工业投资的比重问题。
    我国第一个五年计划规定重工业投资的比重特别大，而且比苏联第一个五年计划重工业投资的比重还要大。前面说过，在五年内的工业基本建设的投资中，制造生产资料工业的投资占百分之八十八点八，制造消费资料工业的投资占百分之十一点二。而苏联的第一个五年计划，制造生产资料工业的投资占百分之八十五点九，制造消费资料工业的投资占百分之十四点一。我国重工业投资占这样大的比重，而轻工业投资占较小的比重，这是否适当呢？是否可以减少重工业的投资，增加轻工业的投资呢？
    大家知道，轻重工业的投资的比例关系，必须根据生产资料优先增长的原理来决定。而在每个发展时期中，这种比例关系的具体规定，又应该照顾到当时的具体条件。我国现在的情况是：原有的重工业的基础特别薄弱，需要我们积极地长期地去扩大重工业的基础以促进国民经济的全面发展。同时，国营和私营的轻工业还有相当大的一部分没有使用的潜在力量，并且还有广大的手工业可以做重要的补充。在我国，一方面许多轻工业品不能充分满足人民日益增长的需要，另一方面许多轻工业设备还有空闲，原因就在于缺少原料。所以说，我国目前发展轻工业的问题，主要不是增加投资的问题，而是增加原料生产的问题。在轻工业的一些原料还不能大量地增产以前，增加轻工业的投资，是不能发挥投资效果的，因为原料供不上，即使工厂建成也不能开工生产。但如果农业丰收，轻工业原料有很大的增产，在现有的轻工业设备不足的时候，我们可以在年度计划中考虑增加一些轻工业工厂的建设。因为轻工业工厂的建设比较容易，建设时间比较短，也就不致于拖延建设进度。
    因此，我们认为第一个五年计划关于轻重工业的投资比例的规定是适当的。
    第三，大中小型企业的配合问题。
    我们强调集中力量保证重点工程的建设，是不是说就可以不注意或者放松中小厂矿的建设呢？毫无疑问，苏联帮助设计和供应设备的那些大企业，像钢铁联合企业、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、重型机器制造厂等等，都是我国工业化事业决不可少的工厂，没有这样一批巨大的、带有工业骨干性质的工厂，我们就无法实现工业化。但这决不是说，我们只要大企业，可以不要中小企业。相反的，中小企业能够在较短的时间内建设完工和投入生产，能够迅速地发挥投资效果和增加生产能力，不但对于增加工业品的供应和支援农业的生产有重大的作用，而且对于资金积累的增加以及支援和配合重点工程的建设，也都是不可缺少的力量。因此，我们必须纠正两种错误的偏向：一种偏向是看不见全局，不区别轻重缓急，盲目地到处建设，从而妨碍重点工程的建设；而另一种偏向则是单纯地醉心于巨大企业的建设，轻视中小型企业的建设，不适当地使国家资金过多集中在少数巨大企业的建设单位，以致不能迅速地发挥投资的效果。
    我们的任务就是要在工业建设的进行中适当地分配巨大企业和中小企业的投资，使大中小型的企业建设能够互相配合和互相协作，以达到既能保证必要的重点工程的建设、又能保证许多企业能够迅速地发挥投资效果的目的。
    第四，工业的地区分布问题。
    我国原有工业的地区分布是很不合理的。据一九五二年的统计，沿海各省的工业产值
  占全国工业总产值的百分之七十以上。逐步地改变旧中国遗留下来的这种不合理的状态，
  在全国各地区适当地分布工业的生产力，使工业接近原料、燃料的产区和消费地区，并使
  工业的分布适合于巩固国防的条件，逐步地提高落后地区的经济水平，这是有计划地发展
  我国国民经济中的重要任务之一。
      五年基本建设计划，对地区的分布作了比较合理的部署，这就是：一方面合理地利用
  东北、上海和其他城市的工业基础，发挥它们的作用，而特别是对于以鞍山钢铁联合企业为中心的东北工业基地进行必要的改建，以便迅速地扩大生产规模，供应国民经济的需要，支援新工业地区的建设；另方面则积极地进行华北、西北、华中等地新的工业基地的建设，在西南开始部分的工业建设。根据这样的方针，五年内开始建设的限额以上的六百九十四个工业建设单位，分布在内地的将有四百七十二个，分布在沿海各地的将有二百二十二个。为着适合工业建设和整个国民经济发展的需要，为着把原有工业基地和新工业基地连接起来，五年内关于铁路的建设也作了相应的部署。同时，根据这种工业部署的方针，我们现在关于城市建设的任务不是发展沿海的大城市，而是要在内地发展中小城市，并适当地限制大城市的发展。现在沿海城市有些盲目发展的毛病，是应该加以纠正的。
    显然，五年计划草案规定的关于工业和铁路的基本建设的地区分布，是符合于国家长远利益的。按照这个计划的部署，到第二个五年计划完成的时候，我国就不但将加强东北的工业基地，而且还将有分布在华北、西北和华中各地区的一些新工业基地，这样也就将在相当大的程度上改变我国广大地区的经济生活。这种工业的地区分布是建立在发展重工业的基础上的，因此也就开始改变了过去工业分布的性质。
    第五，基本建设的标准问题。
    不论是企业或城市的新建和改建，我们必须把生产性的建设和非生产性的建设这两种标准区别开来。在过去几年中，我们疏忽了这个区别，因而在许多非生产性的建设中犯了方针上的错误，使得许多非生产性的建设标准远远地脱离我国现在经济发展的水平，脱离我国现在社会的生活水平，在许多地方不适当地建造起许多高楼大厦，而且有不少企业把那些可以从简的附属建设、工厂办公室、职工宿舍、食堂等也都建成现代化的，甚至有的在新建厂矿还未有效地投入生产以前，一切福利设施如礼堂、俱乐部等等，不但都已建设齐全，而且还是采用了很高的标准。不少新工业区的城市建设也标准过高，过早地要求现代化，过份地讲究街道市容。所有这些，也就浪费了资金，浪费了人力和物力，违反了重点建设的方针。根据中国共产党中央委员会和中国共产党的全国代表会议的指示，我们正在改正这个错误。我们区别的标准是这样：许多限额以上的、特别是属于重点建设的厂矿，必须力求采用最新的技术，厂房也要尽可能地适合最新技术设备的要求；至于其他非
  生产性的建设标准则一律都要大大降低下来，城市规划的标准也要降低。区别了这两种标
  准，就使我们有可能节省那些不应有的和可以节省的支出，而用于增加生产性的建设，来加速我国建设的速度。这是有关我们国家建设长远利益的一个重大的决定，从中央到地方
  的一切国家机关和一切企业部门都必须遵守这个决定，不能违反这个决定。我在下面说明节约问题的时候，还将联系到这个问题，这里就不再多说了。
      第六，保证工程的质量问题。
    上面我所说的关于工业和运输业的基本建设的几个问题，是属于方针上的问题。当然，
  只有正确的方针是不够的，有了正确的方针之后，重要的是必须把工作做好。大家都知道，
  我们现在的技术水平还很低，而且为着争取时间，我们有些建设工程不得不边勘察、边设
  计、边施工，并在建设的过程中来试制各种机器设备，因此，某些工程就存在着质量差、
  进度慢、浪费多等严重缺点，而放在我们面前的任务，就是要努力去克服这些缺点，特别
  重要的是要保证工程的质量。应该看到新建厂矿、铁路的工程质量的好坏，对于这些厂
  矿、铁路在长时期中有着完全不同的后果。国民党统治时期所筑的宝鸡——天水铁路，因
  为工程质量极端低劣，如果今后不加改建，就不能改变这条铁路一年中许多日子处于瘫痪
  的状态。过去几年，我们曾经修复了许多厂矿、铁路，但是必须看到修复原有厂矿、铁路
  是一回事，新建厂矿、铁路是另一回事，决不可以把新建看成修复那样简单。因此，今后
  必须加强以下几个方面的工作，以求保证工程的质量：
      一、提高设计工作，在设计人员中确立正确的设计思想和负责的工作态度，力求避免
  在设计中造成差错；
      二、加强施工的技术指导，严格地按照设计文件的要求进行施工，同时积极地推广工
   人、工程技术人员和职员中的先进施工经验，鼓励合理化建议；
    三、各有关方面必须认真地协同地工作，保证基本建设所需要的设备和材料能够合乎
  设计的标准，并及时地供应；
      四、国家机关和基本建设主管部门经常对工程的质量进行切实的检查。
        （二）关于工业的生产问题
    我国第一个五年计划规定工业总产值增长百分之九十八点三，即每年递增百分之十四点七。这个速度比起恢复时期要低，但就第一个五年计划的条件说来，这个速度是高的，是带有积极性质的。
    建设时期和恢复时期的情况不同，建设时期工业生产增长的速度低于恢复时期工业生产增长的速度，这是自然的。原因是：旧企业生产的恢复比较容易，新企业的建设和新技术的利用比较困难，而且工业产值的基数又一年一年地增加。虽然是这样，但根据我国现有工业设备的生产潜力，五年内工业生产增长的速度是可能更高些。如果我们努力设法去克服困难，那末我们就不但能够完成计划，并且有可能超额完成计划。
    五年内工业生产计划的完成，主要地依靠我国原有的企业。按照全国的工业总产值大体计算，一九五七年比一九五二年新增加的产值中约有百分之七十左右为原有企业所增产，由新建和重大改建的企业增产的还只占百分之三十左右。原有企业除供应新建企业以设备、材料和满足人民所需要的日用品外，还担负着为国家积累资金和培养干部等重大任务。因此，除了新建和扩建的企业应该在保证工程质量的前提下，争取提早投入生产外，必须重视现有企业的生产工作，充分发挥现有企业的潜在力量，争取超额完成生产计划。有些部门和有些地方，只顾建设新的厂矿，不重视利用原有的厂矿，不设法发挥原有厂矿的生产能力，这显然是很错误的，必须加以纠正。
    我国的地方工业和手工业，在供应城乡人民的生产需要和生活需要方面，起着重要的作用。过去几年中，由于计划工作方面的缺点和其他原因，地方工业的某些行业曾经发生过盲目发展的毛病，使全国工业生产的安排增加了一些困难。但总的说来，地方工业的积极发展是正确的。今后应该适应国家计划的要求，贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，继续正确地发挥地方工业的作用，发挥手工业的作用。有些部门和有些地方，对地方工业和手工业在国民经济中的作用估计不足，因而不去积极地有计划地领导和帮助地方工业和手工业的发展，这显然是错误的，必须加以纠正。
    完成和超额完成五年计划规定的工业生产指标，有决定意义的问题是：增产和节约工业原料，试制新种类产品，提高企业管理工作的水平。我现在就这三个问题作如下的说明。
    第一，增产和节约工业原料问题。
    五年内增加工业品产量的一个困难是工业原料不够。我在前面说到轻重工业投资比重问题的时候已经提出这点。所谓原料不够，首先是农产品的工业原料不够，这就是棉花、麻、油料、烟叶、甘蔗等等原料增长的数量暂时将还低于工业生产增长的要求。其次是来自重工业的原料不够，这些原料有的是产量还少，有的是目前国内还不能生产。当然，有些原料是可以争取进口的，但是由于农业土产品的增产不够，或者国内消耗过多，使土产品的出口数量不够，减少了外汇收入，因而也减少了工业原料的进口。
    为着克服工业原料不足的困难，我们必须增加棉花、黄麻、洋麻、烤烟、甘蔗、甜菜、花生、芝麻、油菜子等工业原料的产量。五年计划规定的关于扩大上述各种技术作物的播种面积的指标，必须保证完成并争取超额完成，同时，这些技术作物的单位面积产量，必须尽可能地提高。以棉花来说，五年内扩大播种面积一千一百多万亩，是有可能实现的，而且因为主要产区大部是老解放区，只要在这些地区对于组织农业生产合作社的工作给以特别的注意，国家对于棉农尽可能地加以援助，提高单位面积产量还是可能的。以烟叶和甘蔗来说，五年内扩大烟叶的播种面积一百多万亩，扩大甘蔗的播种面积一百多万亩，也是能够实现的。我们应该尽可能地扩大粮食的播种面积，另一方面要力求在不影响粮食增产的条件下，多增加一些技术作物的播种面积。多种五十万亩烟叶，就能增产五十万箱纸烟；多种四十万亩甘蔗，就能增产十万吨食糖。以油料作物来说，如果广大农民群众都尽可能地利用空隙土地动手种植，五年内扩大播种面积三千二百多万亩的计划，是不但可以完成，而且可以超过的。
    我们必须增加出口土产品的产量，以便换取外汇，增加工业生产所必需的进口原料。
  只要各地方国家机关和全国农民加以重视，出口土产品的增产是完全可能的。
    在工业原料问题上，我们除积极地增产以外，必须节约地使用原料，克服浪费。如果每件棉纱平均少用两斤棉花，全国每年就可以至少增产两万件棉纱。根据我们最近得到的
  材料，上海市在一九五五年上半年第一季度，公私纺织厂每件纱的平均用棉量已降低到三百
  八十六点一斤，比全国一九五五年上半年每件纱的计划用棉量降低将近七斤。其中国营棉纺织厂每件纱的平均用棉量为三百八十四点九八斤，公私合营棉纺织厂每件纱的平均用棉量为三百八十六点六五斤，私营棉纺织厂每件纱的平均用棉量为三百八十七点四二斤。这种节约用棉的先进经验，应该认真地在各地推广。又如，只要每百斤油料平均多出一斤油，全国每年就可以至少增产一亿余斤食油。吉林省四平市李川江的“大豆榨油操作法”，使每百斤大豆的出油量在一九五四年提高到十三斤半，比全国每百斤大豆的平均出油量多二斤左右；李川江所在的榨油车间于一九五五年第一季度，每百斤大豆的出油量又提高到十四斤以上。这个先进的操作方法，全国各地都应该认真地加以研究和推广。对于某些原料不足的工业品，我们还应该积极地研究某些代用材料，扩大原料的来源，来增加生产。
    有许多产品，例如煤炭、磷肥、盐等，还有提高产量的潜力，只要我们加以组织，并给以必要的投资，那末，增加产量是完全可能的。
    第二，试制新种类产品问题。
    五年内增加工业品产量的另一个困难，是有一些企业由于技术水平低，能够制造的产品不适合需要，而有销路的产品一时还不会制造。
    某些急需的东西一时不会制造，这是我国工业前进过程中不可避免的现象。国家的机械工业部门正在设法改进。但是新产品太少并不只是机械工业部门独有的现象。应当考查的是各级主管部门对于新产品的制造工作，是否作了应有的努力？全国各个方面首先是各个工业部门是否已经把这件工作看成是共同工作而共同努力？我们以为，我们的努力还不够。我们必须集中一切可能的力量，设计新产品，试制新产品，给新产品试制工作以充分热情的协助。有些市场需要的工业品，例如若干金属产品、若干机械产品、若干化学工业产品、若干医疗器械，我们不但有原料，也有自制的能力，仅仅因为没有去组织生产，所以没有制成。因此企业管理机关必须经常了解国家建设和市场需要，制造适合国家建设和市场需要的产品。
    必须了解，试制新产品这一工作的意义，决不只限于提高目前的工业生产，更重要的在于这是提高我国工业技术水平的必要途径，而提高工业技术水平，又是完成社会主义工业化的任务的一个基本条件。
    国家的经济工作部门，应该设立关于研究和试制新种类产品的领导机构，以便有系统
  地了解和收集国内外关于生产资料和生活资料的新种类产品的生产情况，加强关于新种类
  产品的计划、设计、试验和制造的工作，不断地总结新种类产品试制的经验，经常地检查新种类产品的试制计划，保证计划的实现。国家应该制定办法，奖励公私企业和手工业制造新种类产品，奖励科学家、技术人员和工人群众的发明和创造，并鼓励公私企业注意利
  用他们的发明和创造，进行试制的工作。认真地注意新事物的出现，并对它们的生长给以热情的帮助，是我们国家工作人员的责任。那种不重视新事物，对新事物丧失感觉的人，
  是应该受到批判的。
      增加新种类产品和工业品产量的一个重要关键，是加强企业内部、各个企业之间、各
  工业部门之间的协同合作。工业生产是互相联系和需要互相配合的，只有协同合作起来才能生产和增产。我国原有工业设备的零散和不相配合，要求我们更加广泛地协同合作，使
  企业的专业化同企业生产之间的协作进一步地结合起来，彻底地改变那种只在本企业或本部门范围内关起门来生产的想法和做法。不仅企业内部在生产上要协同合作，一个部门的
  各企业之间在生产上要协同合作，而且各部门之间在生产上也要协同合作。为了能够很好地
  协同合作，各个车间或工段、各个企业、各个部门都应该树立全局观点，克服局部观点。
    有关企业同企业之间、部门同部门之间重大的协同合作的项目，应该分别地列入国家和部门的生产计划；同时，应该普遍地推行企业同企业之间的合同以及企业内部各车间的
  联系合同，使工业部门、各企业单位在生产中能够很好地相互配合和相互衔接，提高工业
  的组织程度。
    第三，提高企业的管理工作水平问题。
    几年来我们企业的管理工作是有很大改进的，因而全国每年都超额完成了生产任务。
  但是，有不少的企业并没有完成计划，有的没有完成产值指标；有的只完成了产值指标，没有完成产品的种类和质量的指标；有的完成了产量和质量的指标，没有完成提高劳动生
  产率和降低成本的指标。有不少的企业在执行计划的时候，存在着忽松忽紧和前松后紧的
  现象，生产很不均衡，增加了生产中的混乱。有不少的企业仍然经常发生伤亡事故和设备
  事故，造成损失。由于企业管理工作的缺点和水平不高，工业品中种类少、质量低、成本
  高等等现象还相当普遍地存在着。因此，一切工业企业，必须按照五年计划草案第三章关
  于实现工业生产计划的必要措施的第六条规定，不断地提高企业管理的水平，特别是加强技术管理和经济核算制，并加强企业中的政治工作，使政治工作和经济工作互相结合，提
  高广大工人职员群众的政治觉悟，充分地发挥群众的积极性和创造性，提高劳动生产率。
    我们应该看到工业生产计划的完成，是存在着一些困难的，那种对于完成工业生产指标满不在乎地认为“没有问题”的态度，是不对的。但是，只要全国劳动人民共同努力，
  增加工业生产，提高工业品的质量，完成和超额完成在五年内工业生产增加产值百分之九
  十八点三的计划指标是完全可能的。那种害怕困难、丧失信心的情绪，也是不对的。
        （三）关于农业的增产问题
    农业生产供应全国人民的食粮，同时，用农产品作原料的工业产品，在目前又占全国工业总产值的百分之五十以上，而且进口工业设备和建设器材所需要的外汇，大部分也是农产品出口换来的。因此，发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。我们集中力量发展工业，但决不能够减轻发展农业的意义。没有农业的相应发展，我们的工业化事业是不可能实现的。防止和克服农业同工业的脱节，是我们在建设社会主义事业中重大而又迫切的任务。
    第一个五年计划规定农业及其副业的总产值在五年内增长百分之二十三点三，到一九五七年达到五百九十六亿六千万元；以产量说，粮食增长百分之十七点六，即增产五百七十八亿斤，到一九五七年达到三千八百五十六亿斤，棉花增长百分之二十五点四，即增产六百六十万担，到一九五七年达到三千二百七十万担。上述指标，虽然已经比原来拟定的有所降低，但因为是以农产品丰收的一九五二年为基数，所以仍然是很高的；而且因为一九五三年和一九五四年两年的农业生产都由于灾荒没有完成原来拟定的增产计划，就增加了五年计划的后三年的增产任务。因此，要达到上述指标，还必须作很大的努力。
    我现在要说的是关于农业的合作化、农业的增产措施、对农业生产的领导这三个问题。
    第一，农业的合作化问题。
    第一个五年计划期间，必须积极地有步骤地在自愿互利原则的基础上，依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，组织农业生产合作社。这是以土地入股、统一经营为特点的农业生产合作社。就是说，这还只是实现部分集体所有制的、半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。但是，这种初步的合作化把分散的小农经营组成几十户的联合经营，就有可能比较合理地组织劳动力和使用土地，就有可能积累资金，来增加农业的投资，使用改良农具，兴修水利，提高耕种技术，以及实现个体农民难于单独进行的种种其他增产措施。根据各地的许多材料看来，农业生产合作社在初建的一、二年内，如果办得不坏，一般可以增产百分之十到二十左右，往后还可以在每年保持某种的增产比例，比互助组高，比个体农民经济的增产率更高出很多。按照目前情况来说，这是一种投资少、收效大、收效快的农业增产办法，又是引导农民走向社会主义的必要步骤。经过这种初级形式的合作化，结合初步的技术改良，而后再逐渐地过渡到高级形式的合作化，结合农业机械化和其他的技术改革，这是引导我国农业生产不断地进步的道路。
    根据几年来互助合作运动的经验和各地方已经达到的成就，第一个五年计划规定，参加现有的初级形式的农业生产合作社的农户将占全国农户总数的三分之一左右。其中东北各省和山西、河北、山东、河南及其他老解放区，合作化的规模都将达到农户半数左右。在技术作物地区和城市郊区，将努力地争取先一步合作化。这个农业合作化的计划，是有可能实现的，我们必须努力地争取实现。国家在财力物力上，将全力支持农业生产合作社的发展。
    我们的农业合作运动有很大的成就。过去几年组织的农业生产合作社，百分之九十以上是巩固的，其中的绝大多数，它们的产量有显著的增加。但有些地方也有少数的农业生产合作社，由于工作进行得较粗较急，发生了强迫命令的倾向和其他的缺点，这些毛病如不纠正，则非但不能增产，可能还要减产。我们对农业生产合作社必须贯彻积极领导、稳步前进的方针，一面巩固，一面发展。在工作中，必须坚决地遵守群众自愿和互利的原则，防止和纠正强迫命令的做法和损害中农利益的行为，并妥善地解决关于农业生产合作社内部的各种问题，如劳动力的计算、土地和其他生产资料的报酬、生产资金的筹集、公积金的比例等等问题。
    在努力发展农业生产合作社的同时，仍然必须进一步地发展和提高各种具体形式的农业劳动互助组织，为农业生产合作社的发展准备条件；仍然必须照顾单干农户的生产积极性，给单干农户以积极的帮助和领导，发挥他们生产的潜在力量，提高单位面积的产量。
    第二，关于农业的增产措施，五年计划草案第四章已经写得很详细，现在我提出以下几点：
    一、开垦宜于耕种的荒地。我国的人口很多，但已耕的土地还很少，必须积极地有计划地把宜于耕种的土地开垦起来，才能从根本上克服农业生产的不足。五年计划规定扩大耕地面积三千八百六十八万亩，是最低的指标，必须尽可能地用各种办法超过这个数字。开垦荒地，一种办法是由国营农场开荒，一切原有的国营农场，应该根据当地可能的条件，适当地扩大耕地面积，同时，应该力求在宜耕荒地较多的地区，有计划地建设新的国营农场，进行开荒；另一种办法是使用机器和采用其他办法进行开荒，有组织地移民耕种，这种办法因为工作复杂，规模较大，国家应该协同各地方统一地拟定具体方案，有领导地进行；再一种办法是农民就地开荒，这种办法因为进行较易，规模较小，可由各地方国家机关领导农民进行。不论是国营农场开荒，移民开荒或农民就地开荒，在今后三年，都应该积极地实施，作为增产的一种重要办法。国家从缩减非生产性建设的支出和行政机关的经费等方面所节约的资金，将有相当大的一部分用之于荒地的开垦。
    在第一个五年计划期间，应该积极地进行宜耕荒地的调查和勘察，完成一亿亩以上荒地的勘察工作，至少完成四千万亩到五千万亩荒地开垦的规划设计工作，为第二个五年计划大规模地开垦荒地做好准备。
    二、兴修水利。水利建设，既能够扩大灌溉面积，促进农作物的增产，又能够防止水旱灾害，避免农作物的减产。许多水利设施，只要有几年增产或减灾的受益，就能抵偿水利的投资。中华人民共和国成立以来，我们曾经大力地进行了水利建设工作，新建的大型水利工程，几年来在同水旱灾害特别是一九五四年洪水斗争中已经发挥了巨大的作用。第一个五年计划期间，除由国家投资建设的巨大水利工程以外，小规模的农田水利，例如受益几十亩到几百亩的工程，也应该根据各地方的实际需要和可能条件，大量地举办。因为这种工程是分散的，建设较易，可以组织农业生产合作社和农民群众来分头进行；在必要的时候，国家将给以财力和物力的帮助。
    三、充分地有效地利用土地。我国人口众多这一特点，使我们有必要并有可能来充分地利用土地。扩大土地的利用除了开垦荒地和增加灌溉面积以外，应该进行土壤的改良工作，如变碱地和砂地为良田，变山坡地为梯田，变旱地为水田。在气候、雨量、地形等自然条件和肥料、水利、劳动力、畜力等经济条件的可能情况下，应该适当地增加耕地的复种指数。在山区，应该适当地进行统一规划，使农业、畜牧业、林业、农家副业的发展互相结合，发展多种经济，并加强保持水土的工作。应该鼓励农民进一步精耕细作，加工加肥，并逐步地推行适合于本地的先进的种植方法，如在低洼地区多种耐水作物，在秋涝地区多种早熟作物和增种小春作物。上述各个方面，有些省份已经取得了初步经验，这些经验，应该加以总结，并因地制宜在各地方逐步地加以推广。各地方群众中行之有效的增产经验，也应该积极地和逐步地加以推广。
    各种技术作物应该积极地和逐步地在适当的地区向山坡和山地扩大种植面积，尽可能地避免因为增加技术作物的播种面积而缩小粮食作物的播种面积。
    四、增加稻米、玉米、薯类等高产量作物的播种面积。稻米的单位面积产量比小麦高至将近两倍，玉米的单位面积产量比别的杂粮可能增加百分之五十，薯类像红薯、土豆等则比一般杂粮的产量要多五、六倍（在使用上，二斤半薯类可以顶一斤粮食）。毫无疑问，扩大这些高产量作物的播种面积，对缓和我国粮食、饲料的紧张情况将有重要的作用。在全国的杂粮产区和其他适当地区，如果再把一、二千万亩粮田改种薯类，则虽然每年减少粮食二、三十亿斤，但能增产薯类一百多亿斤到二百多亿斤。因此，在杂粮产区和适宜于薯类生长的地区，地方国家机关应该研究和计划扩大薯类和其他高产量作物的播种面积的问题，并积极地实施。农业机关和科学研究机关，应该认真地研究和培植薯类的优良品种，研究薯类的防治腐烂、改良储藏和加工的方法。
    五、使用新式步犁、双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁，积极地蓄肥造肥和合理地施肥，推广优良品种，消灭农作物的病害和虫害等等，都是对提高农作物产量有效的措施，都应该因地制宜地加以实施。各级国家机关，应该加强发放农贷的工作，加强供应肥料、农具的工作，加强技术推广站、拖拉机站、抽水机站的工作，加强国营农场的示范作用，在农民中进行农业技术改良和种子改良的试验工作，并组织关于这种试验和推广的农民训练班，使国家对农民的援助同广大农民群众实行的增产措施结合起来。
    第三，对农业生产的领导问题。
    发展农业生产，除了必须在全国范围内对方针、政策、步骤有统一的领导以外，更重要的是发扬地方的积极性，加强地方党政机关对农业的领导，结合地方的具体情况，因地制宜地采取有效的增产办法。各省必须集中足够的力量放在领导农业增产上，至于专区、县、区、乡，则无例外地必须以领导农业生产和农业互助合作运动为工作的重点。
    地方各级党政机关，都应该根据当地的具体情况和实际经验，定出本地方农业增产的五年计划，并贯彻党和国家关于农村工作和农业增产的各项政策，提高农民群众的生产积极性，保证这个计划的实现。地方的农业增产计划，应该适应于国家计划的要求，根据本地方的可能条件，拟定超额完成国家计划的指标，使国家计划有更加可靠的基础。同时，地方的农业增产计划，应该切实地照顾到当地群众的具体需要，使农作物的生产能够多样地满足农民的要求，刺激和发挥农民的经营积极性。
    有些农村的地方国家机关和工作人员，还没有集中力量去领导农业生产，也没有认真地研究增产或防灾的有效办法，并动员群众去实行增产或防灾的措施，使农业生产的领导处于自流的状态。有的在推广增产的各种先进经验和措施的时候，不是根据当地的具体条件，因地制宜，而是千篇一律，不问效果。有的在发展农业合作化的时候，不是耐心地向农民进行说服教育工作和采取典型示范的方法，而是违反群众自愿的原则，实行强迫命令。所有这些农村工作中的缺点，都应该加以改正。
    这里，我还要特别地说一说关于发展畜牧业的问题。畜牧业的发展，可以增加农业生产所需要的耕畜和肥料，可以增加轻工业所需要的皮毛等原料，可以增加市场所需要的肉类的供应量，可以增加农民和牧民的收入。因此，在所有的农业区和畜牧区，都应该切实地执行五年计划第四章所规定的有关发展畜牧业的各项措施，促进牲畜的迅速繁殖，保证第一个五年计划关于增加马、牛、骡、驴、羊、猪等牲畜数量的指标的完成和超额完成。国家机关应该在财力上和技术上尽可能地扶助少数民族地区的畜牧业的发展，并加强对牧区工作的领导。
        （四）关于对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题
    现在我要说的是国家对于资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造中的若干问题，即关于改造的步骤问题，资本主义工业改造的部署问题，资本主义商业改造的部署问题，资本家必须遵守国家法律、接受改造的问题。
    第一，改造的步骤问题。
    我国目前还存在大量的复杂的私营工商业。以工业说，一九五三年私营工业（不包括个体手工业）的从业人员有二百多万人，其中十个职工以上的资本主义工业企业有四万五千多户，职工一百五十多万人。以商业说，一九五三年全国资本主义批发商的从业人员将近二十万人，资本主义零售商的从业人员有二百万人左右，小商小贩还有几百万人。在上述私营工商业的从业人员中，资本家占相当的数量。对于这样大量的复杂的私营工商业，要全部实行社会主义改造，是一件很艰巨的工作。
    对于私营工商业的社会主义改造，应该区别资本主义性质和独立劳动者性质，而分别地采取适当的步骤和灵活的形式。
    国家对资本主义工商业的改造，是分两个步骤实现的，第一步是把资本主义转变为国家资本主义，第二步是把国家资本主义转变为社会主义。
    国家资本主义，这是国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造中的过渡形式。中华人民共和国宪法规定，要鼓励和指导资本主义工商业“转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。”这就是说，我们在过渡时期内，要消灭资本主义的剥削制度，并不是一下子实现的，而是通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义逐步地实现的。我们将让资本家有一个必要的时间，通过国家资本主义这个过渡形式，在国家和工人阶级的领导下逐步地接受改造。
    国家资本主义有各种不同的形式。高级的形式是公私合营；中级和低级的形式，在工业中是加工定货和收购包销，在商业中是代购、代销和经销。
    过去几年，我们对资本主义的改造工作，一般地是由低级、中级形式发展到高级形式，由主要行业推广到次要行业，由大城市扩展到中、小城市。这种有系统的稳步推进的办法，经验证明是比较适当的，我们以后将继续推行这种办法。
    几年来的事实证明，把资本主义经济转变为国家资本主义经济以后，在性质上已经有不同程度的变化，即在不同程度上加进了社会主义这个因素，这就限制了资本主义的生产、经营的无政府状态和资本家唯利是图的活动，并使这一部分经济在不同程度上纳入国家计划的轨道。同时，由于工人在生产中的地位的改变，就提高了劳动热情，从而提高了企业的劳动生产率和改善了经营管理，并使企业内部的劳资关系有可能得到适当的处理。由此可见，按照我国的条件，采取国家资本主义这个过渡形式来逐步地改造资本主义工商业，逐步地克服资本主义生产关系同生产力增长的矛盾，并由此便于逐步地以全民所有制代替资本家的所有制，这是必要的和行得通的。
    国家对独立劳动者性质的私营工商业的改造，是按照它们不同行业的情况，根据自愿的原则，分别地用不同的合作形式把它们逐步地组织起来，经过各种低级的合作形式，逐步地过渡到较高级的合作形式，使他们能够有效地为国家和社会的需要服务。
    在第一个五年计划期间，预计对于私营工商业的改造将达到如下的成就，就是：私营工业的大部分将转变为各种形式的国家资本主义，而私营的现代工业的大部分将转变为高级形式的国家资本主义——公私合营；私营商业中有一半以上将转变为各种国家资本主义形式的商业和由小商小贩组织起来的合作形式的小商业。
    第二，资本主义工业改造的部署问题。
    对于国营工业、合作社营工业、公私合营工业、私营工业，在分配生产任务、分配原料、收购产品方面，必须贯彻国家规定的统筹兼顾的方针。一方面，对于社会主义工业的发展，国家给予优先的权利，而非社会主义经济成分的企业则没有这种优先的权利，在这点上，它们之间是有所不同的；另方面，又应该适当地照顾私营工业在我国过渡时期的作用，在
  一些方面，特别是对于公私企业的工人职员，要一视同仁。
    在国民经济恢复时期，国家为着调整私营工商业，就已经对一部分的私营工厂（首先是棉纺厂）实行加工定货，这种政策，对安排私营工业的生产收到了很大的效果。一九五三年国家开始有计划建设以后，为了加强生产的计划性，对许多重要原料，有的由国家差不多全部收购，有的由国家大部收购，这些收购的原料，都由国家实行统一分配。这时候，国家对于私营工业的产品，绝大部分已经实行加工定货、统购包销，使这类私营工业成为中级形式和初级形式的国家资本主义工业。在这个过程中，由于抗美援朝期间和一九五三年开始大规模建设的时候加工定货数量的增加，由于商业部门在加工定货工作中存在某些盲目性，全国若干行业的工厂，包括国营的和私营的，都曾经盲目地扩充设备。一九五四年某些产品加工定货相对减少以后，若干行业就发生生产任务不足、开工不足的现象。同时，在开工不足的行业中，有过一段时间对公私工厂的原料和生产任务的分配不够适当，即公私合营和私营的工厂分得少些，因而私营工厂中的某些行业就遇到了较大的困难。这种情况已经有所改善。
    根据国家的统筹兼顾的方针，对于公私工业的生产正在进行统一安排。对原料和定货的分配，国营工厂在必要的时候，可以分得多些，但同时必须适当地照顾公私合营和私营的工厂，使它们能够维持生产。因为只有维持私营工厂的生产，才有利于巩固工人阶级的统一和团结，也有利于保持工人阶级同资产阶级在过渡时期中必要的经济联盟，同时有利于对资本主义工商业的改造的顺利进行。中央各工业部在制定工业生产计划的时候，必须把私营工业的生产能力计算在内，纳入计划，合理地加以利用。同时，中央和地方都将设立专门机构，协同有关工业部，来分工管理公私合营和私营的工厂的业务。
    根据统筹兼顾的方针，国家采取逐行逐业并在原行业中全面安排的办法，来进行对私营工业的改造。这种办法，不是在一个行业中只安排几家工厂，而是把这一行业的所有私营工厂统一加以安排。例如：凡有条件实行公私合营的，就进行公私合营；目前还没有条件合营的，就尽可能地进行加工定货，或由国家收购它们的产品；中小工厂需要和可以联营合并的，就鼓励资本家采取以大带小的办法，逐步地联营合并，为接受公私合营创造条件；对于那些确实没有改造条件而必须淘汰的工厂，就帮助它们安排职工，淘汰企业。随着上述各种安排，有步骤地发展公私合营。
    对于私营工业我们应该积极地实行公私合营，但又必须稳步前进，防止冒进。必须作好一切准备工作，使合营以后，生产管理的水平能够提高，防止无人负责、生产下降的现象。
    在有盈利的私营企业中，应该依照法令规定让资本家得到适当的一部分利润；在公私合营企业中，也应该让私股得到法令规定的利益。但同时必须对那些重犯行贿、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、偷税漏税、盗窃国家经济情报等所谓“五毒”行为的不法资本家，对那些抗拒国家领导、破坏工人阶级团结、破坏企业的不法资本家，给以应得的处分。
      第三，资本主义商业改造的部署问题。
    私营商业可以分为两大类：一类是批发商，一类是零售商。我们对于这两类私商应该采取下列的处理办法。
    原来批发商的绝大部分都是拥有较多资金、雇用较多职工的资本家。如果让批发商掌握市场的货源，他们都必然唯利是图，进行各种投机囤积的活动，而有害于国计民生。因此，必须由国营商业来掌握主要商品批发的业务。一九五○年到一九五三年上半年，国家对于主要农产品的收购和主要工业品的加工定货、大量收购，批发商的业务已经逐渐缩小。一九五三年下半年到现在，国家对粮食、油料、棉花、布匹实行了统购统销，对绝大部分工业品从出厂到零售，一般不让批发商掌握货源，这样，就使许多供不应求的商品避免了批发商的投机囤积。国家对于已经没有货源的批发商，或则让他们经营二批发，或则正由国营商业部门录用其从业人员。有些商品，国家没有经营或者只经营一部分的，仍让批发商继续经营。国家将使这一部分现在还能经营的批发商，逐步地改造成为国家资本主义的批发商。
    零售商是私商中的绝大部分。在零售商中，除商业资本家以外，大多数是店员和不雇店员的小商小贩，此外还有一部分是出卖产品的手工业者，还有一部分是饮食业和服务业中的人员。零售商的业务在近年同解放以前相比，已经有了很大的变化。自从国家对于绝大部分工业品实行加工定货、统购包销和主要农产品由合作社收购以后，零售商中的大多数，不论是座商或摊贩，他们的货源只能依靠国营商业和合作社营商业的批发，因此他们的业务大体上已经是为国营和合作社营商业进行代销、经销。
    在商业的社会主义改造方面，一九五三年冬季以来，由于某些地方的国营商业特别是合作社营商业的零售营业额增加得快了一些，使私营零售商的营业额下降多了一些。现在已经加以调整。国家为了维持私营零售商，维持城市和农村的小商小贩，无论在城市或集镇，凡属国营、合作社营商业的零售额增加得太多了的，已暂时停止前进或者适当后退；在集镇上，合作社营业也已适当减少零售，多做批发，并用代销、经销形式把小商小贩组织起来。同时，各个城市集镇，将根据当地情况，按照行业定出一个既能够稳定市场物价、又能够维持私商经营的关于零售额方面的公私比重，并尽可能地使这种公私比重稳定一个时期，以便有可能对私营商业的从业人员作适当安排，并便于逐行逐业地对私营商业实行社会主义的改造。
    第四，资本家必须遵守国家法律、接受改造的问题。
    在社会主义改造过程中，私营工商业在生产上和经营上遇着某些困难是难于完全避免的。在国家的统筹兼顾和对私营工商业进行全面安排的方针下，工商业资本家应该努力克服困难，服从国营经济的领导，遵守国家计划，积极整顿企业，改善经营管理，准备条件来接受社会主义改造。
    几年来，在工商业资本家中，出现了一批能够爱国守法、对于接受社会主义改造采取积极态度、并起带头作用的人。对于这样的人，国家是表示欢迎和重视他们的。但另一方面，仍有一些资本家，对社会主义改造抱着消极态度，其中有些人还在进行宪法所禁止的
  “危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划”的非法行为，用更巧妙的方法重犯“五毒”；有些人甚至抗拒或破坏社会主义改造。像这类人，就应该受到舆论的指责和法律的制裁。
    对于资本主义工业和资本主义商业的社会主义改造所采取的各种复杂的形式，是工人阶级同资产阶级在过渡时期实行经济联盟的特殊历史条件下所产生的。同时必须看到，这也就是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。以为不经过斗争就能够改造的看法，是不符合社会发展的历史和实际情况的，因此是完全错误的。我们根据宪法规定，在过渡时期，依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权，并让守法的资本家在一定时期内得到法令所规定的利润；同时，对那些违法的资本家，则必须给以应得的处罚。不雇职工的私营零售商，虽然他们是自己劳动的人，我们对他们应该加以团结，但是他们所参加的是商品流转中的劳动，同时他们是私有者，所以很容易转变成为投机者。因此，对于他们的社会主义改造也必须经过一定程度和一定形式的斗争。
    几年来的经验证明了：对资本主义企业的改造，需要同资本家思想的改造结合进行。我们鼓励资本家努力学习国家在过渡时期的总任务和各项政策，努力改造自己，遵守国家法律，积极地拥护国家的社会主义改造的事业。
          （五）关于保证市场的稳定问题
    保证市场的稳定，是完成第一个五年计划的必要条件。
    第一个五年计划草案关于保证市场稳定的措施是这样规定的：
    一、继续保持财政收支的平衡，增加财政和物资的后备力量；
    二、随着工业农业的生产的发展，相应地发展城乡和内外的物资交流，扩大商品的流通；
    三、对供应不足的某些主要的工业农业产品，在努力增产的基础上逐步地实施计划收购和计划供应的政策。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，在很短的时间内，即在一九五○年初就把市场物价稳定下来，这是同国家财政收支的平衡和国家掌握巨大的物资后备力量这类措施相联系的。由于国家财政的收支平衡，所以就能够稳定币值，因而也就能够稳定物价。由于国家有巨大的物资后备力量，所以就能够供应市场上所需要的物资，因而也就能够同私商的囤积居奇、投机倒把作斗争。这种市场稳定，是我国在经济恢复时期的一个重大的成就。这个成就对国民经济的迅速恢复和人民生活的改善，起了显著的作用。毫无疑义，我们在有计划的经济建设时期，必须继续巩固这个成就。
    发展城乡和内外的物资交流，扩大商品流通，以促进生产的发展和经济的繁荣，并巩固工农的联盟，这是我们国家的一个重要的经济政策。第一个五年计划必须努力增加生产，开辟货源，来继续贯彻这个政策。根据五年计划的规定，公私商业出售给人民日常消费的各种主要商品，将有各种不同程度的增长。就几种主要的日常消费品来看，一九五七年比一九五二年将有如下的增长比例：粮食增长百分之十三点三，猪肉增长百分之五十七，食用植物油增长百分之六十五点九，水产品增长百分之七十点一，食盐增长百分之三十四点三，食糖增长百分之一百二十二点九，棉布增长百分之五十五点一，针织品增长百分之一百零五点三，胶鞋增长百分之六十九点八，煤油增长百分之一百四十三点五，机制纸增长百分之八十九点二，卷烟增长百分之八十七。这些主要的日常消费品增长的比例，按照通常的情况来说，是不算低的，中国历史上从来也没有过在这样短的时间内有这样高的增长比例。
    但是，由于人民生活的不断改善，人民购买力的迅速提高，同时由于国家投资建设的许多工业企业要经过一个时期才能够更多地增加商品量，而且目前农业原料增产进度比较缓慢的情况也不可免地使某些轻工业品的大量增产受到相当的限制，所以在一个相当长的时期内，人民购买力的增长速度将超过消费品生产的增长速度，而农村购买力的增长速度将比城市购买力的增长速度还要来得快些。许多商品供不应求的现象在一个时期内是很难避免的。
    在一九五四年召开的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，陈云同志的发言里已经详细地说明了粮食、食油、肉类、布匹等消费品供不应求的根本原因，是因为人民购买力增长的速度超过了这些消费品生产增长的速度，而不是像有些人所怀疑的那样，认为是消费品生产量的减少，或者是因为出口多了。
    我们认为市场上某些消费品的供不应求的现象是不应该让它自流地发展下去的，必须采取有效的措施来逐步地解决这个问题。
    人民消费品的供应量的增加，只能在发展工业农业生产的基础上逐步地实现。因此，解决某些消费品供不应求的问题，根本的道路是发展工业农业生产，这是全国人民的任务，特别是工人和农民的任务。
    为着继续保持市场的稳定，除努力增加生产外，国家必须分别主要商品生产的不同情况，逐步地推行计划收购和计划供应的政策，以便有计划地掌握货源和组织供应，严厉地同投机商作斗争，不让私商有操纵市场的可能。
    国家在一九五三年十一月开始实行了粮食的计划收购和计划供应，随后对食用植物油也实行了计划收购和计划供应；在一九五四年九月，又对棉花实行计划收购，对棉布实行计划收购和计划供应。在这两年内，国家也扩大了对工业品的加工定货和收购包销，扩大了对其他主要农产品的收购。事实已经证明：这种措施，无论对于商品生产者或广大消费者都是有利无害的，仅仅对于投机者不利，因为他们无法投机倒把了。这种措施，对于国家实现五年计划，无疑是一个重要的保证，是符合于人民的目前利益和长远利益的。当然，这个政策的实施，将要在一定的程度上改变几万万人民的生活习惯，并改组市场供销关系，这样一项巨大的改革，在开始实行的几年内，工作中是很难不发生缺点的。但是必须看到，我们的成绩是主要的。
    关于粮食的计划收购和计划供应，国家已经在一九五五年春季开始采用了“定产、定购、定销”的办法，确定全国计划收购的总数今后三年不变。最近，鉴于城乡销量有些过宽或供应不当的情况，制定了改进粮食供应的具体办法，坚决压缩销量，以便有可能适当减少购量，并储备一些粮食。这些办法不仅使得国家能够掌握必要数量的粮食，保证国家对人民的粮食供应，而且将能够进一步地提高农民的增产积极性，促进农业生产的发展。这对于改善城乡关系，加强工业同农业的结合，巩固工人阶级同农民的团结，是极其重要的。因此，我们必须说服工人阶级和其他缺粮人民，说服一切粮食消费者，尽量地节约粮食，减少国家的供应，使得国家有可能减少收购的数量，以提高农民特别是中农的生产积极性。
    关于粮食的计划收购和计划供应的政策，曾经有过一些人采取怀疑甚至反对的态度。有些人借口我们在这个工作中所发生的一些缺点，而否认这个政策实施的重大成就。他们看不见一般情况是好的这个事实。当然，这些都是错误的。
    粮食的计划收购和计划供应的好处何在呢？农民对这个问题作了很好的回答。最近我们全国人民代表大会的代表梁希先生从浙江农村视察回来说，绍兴新鉴乡的农民指出了十二个好处，这些就是：“支援工业好，支援解放台湾好，支援灾区人民好，稳定物价好，促进互助合作好，增加生产发展生产好，节约粮食减少浪费好，削弱资本主义好，银行优待储蓄好，改善生活好，合理供应好，节约工夫好。”我们把这些好处概括为如下几点：
    第一，支援工业建设和国防建设。这就是说，保证城市、集镇和工矿区共有九千多万人对粮食的需要，保证几百万国防部队和公安部队对粮食的需要。大家知道，农民是不愿意反革命复辟的，是希望解放台湾的，而要避免反革命复辟，要解放台湾，没有工业建设和国防建设是不行的。因此，支援工业建设和国防建设，同时也就是保卫农民自己的利益，农民是很清楚地懂得这一点的。
    第二，使粮食和其他主要农产品的买卖不受投机商人的操纵，避免生产者和消费者受投机商人的买贱卖贵的剥削。如果不实行计划收购和计划供应，私商就要操纵粮食市场，大发横财，而整个国内市场物价的稳定就要被破坏，资本主义和农村阶级分化就要发展，成千成万的农民就要破产，工人群众和城市居民的生活就要恶化。显然，农民和其他广大的人民群众，也是很清楚地懂得这一点的。
    第三，促进农业、畜牧业、林业、渔业、盐业和农村副业的发展。这就是说，保证贫农、农村的手工业者和其他缺粮人民对粮食的需要，保证技术作物区的农民和牧民、林民、渔民、盐民、船民等非农业劳动者对粮食的需要，使他们能够按照合理的价格得到粮食，因而能够安心地从事生产。
    第四，保证灾区人民对粮食的需要这一点上，粮食的计划收购和计划供应的政策起了很大的作用。像一九五四年我国大片地区遇到百年来未有的洪水灾害，如果国家没有实行这样的粮食政策，灾区人民的生活和灾区生产的恢复是不堪设想的。灾区人民认为人民政府是中国历史上从来没有过的好政府，这一点是很可以理解的。
    第五，粮食的计划收购和计划供应，打击了投机商人，打击了富农，就是说，打击了农村的资本主义经济，进一步削弱了资本主义在农民中的影响，也削弱了农民中的资本主义自发倾向，因而促进农业生产合作化的发展。
    由此可见，粮食的计划收购和计划供应，对于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，对于全体人民的切身利益，是有重大作用的，这是国家实现过渡时期总任务的一个重大的措施。经验证明，这个政策是完全必要和必须坚决地贯彻的，但是收购和供应的具体办法，应该不断改善，克服缺点，巩固成绩。
    尽可能地充分供应和优先供应农民以他们所需要的生产资料和生活资料，使农民卖粮所得的钱能够用来发展生产和改善生活，这对于粮食收购计划的顺利完成是有密切关系的；同时，这对于减轻农村购买力所加给粮食供应方面的压力，也有重要的作用。所以，一九五三年，在实行粮食的统购统销的同时，国家就确定了“城市和农村都需要的工业品，应该优先地供应农村”的方针。两年来，国营和合作社商业部门对这个方针的贯彻，是有成绩的，但也存在着缺点。这主要是供应不及时，供应的品种不尽合需要。农民的需要是具体的，多样性的，各地都不同的。国营和合作社商业部门必须根据不同地区、不同季节和农民的不同习惯等情况，认真地改善对农村的工业品的供应。（六）关于培养建设干部问题科学技术人材的缺乏，显然是我们前进中的一个巨大的困难。我们在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划中必须完成的重大政治任务之一，就是培养大量的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的工程技术人员，培养熟练工人，以及各方面的专门人材。五年内，我们培养建设干部的工作是从两个方面进行的，即一方面是调整、扩充、新建高等学校和中等专业学校，另一方面是利用企业和机关的有利条件，开办各种业余学校和训练班。全国解放以来，国家对高等学校和中等专业学校积极地进行了调整和扩充，并进行了新院校的建设，学生人数有了迅速的增加。五年内，高等教育以发展高等工科学校和综合大学的理科为重点，同时适当地发展农林、师范、医药和其他各类学校，到一九五七年，我国将共有高等学校二百○八所。中等专业教育的重点也是培养工业和农业的技术干部和管理干部。在高等学校和中等专业学校中培养建设干部，今后应该着重提高质量，同时兼顾数量，使提高质量和增加数量正确地结合起来。那种片面追求数量而忽视质量的倾向，对于国家建设显然是不利的。现在各高等工业学校已经感觉到学生的数量增加过快，而学习的质量过低，厂矿方面也已经普遍地要求提高技术干部的培养质量。今后必须努力地注意学生质量的问题，在保证质量的条件下适当地增加数量，使培养出来的技术干部在政治上是可靠的，在业务上能够相当掌握现代科学技术知识，同时身体是健康的。当然，学生质量也只能够逐步地提高，要积极地创造提高的条件，不能够一下子要求过高过急，也不能够强求一律，但必须有一个最低限度，例如高等学校招收的新生，最低限度的条件，应当是政治上可靠，身体能够坚持学习，学业上能够跟得上班。达不到这些最低限度的条件，是不能够或者很难培养出有用的建设人材来的。根据这样的方针，高等教育部已重新修订了第一个五年计划后三年的高等学校的招生计划，并且决定将高等工业学校在两三年内逐步地从四年制改为五年制，逐步地取消两年或三年毕业的专修科；对中等技术学校则决定积极地加以整顿，提高质量，并适当地扩大。同时，决定深入地研究各种专业的招生比例，使学校的各种专业培养计划，能够同各业务部门的需要互相适应。
      今后关于培养建设干部的计划，应该特别重视业余教育的计划。国家应该大量地同时是逐步地创办函授学校和夜大学，使没有受过系统的科学技术教育的在职干部，能够有机会逐步地系统地提高自己的文化和科学技术的水平。在规模比较大的厂矿中或工矿地区，今后也应该逐步地普遍地设立正规的工人业余学校，从小学、中学一直到大学，来不断地提高工人的文化和科学技术知识。过去我们的教育领导机关和工会对于工人的业余教育没有予以充分的注意，任其自流，许多业余学校由于得不到领导，得不到适当的师资和教材而不能够提高。今后必须改正这个缺点，把培养在职的工人职员作为培养建设干部计划的一个重要组成部分。
    为了适应在全国范围内经济建设的需要，高等学校尤其是高等工业学校过分地集中在沿海城市的状况，在今后的发展计划中，应该逐步地加以改变。在沿海城市中，今后一般地不应该再新建和大规模地扩建高等学校。内地的高等学校应该按照合理的部署，逐步地建设起来。
    在积极地培养干部的同时，各级国家机关和各企业部门应该十分重视现有科学技术人员的合理使用问题。有许多工业生产单位，基本建设单位，以及其它经济单位和经济领导机关，对现有科学技术人员，还没有合理地分配和使用，或者把一些有专门技术的人放在其它岗位，或者虽然放在适当的岗位而不能发挥他们的专长和作用。一般说来，现有技术人员的分配，放在上层和管理部门的是多了些，同时，有些企业部门和厂矿对他们的创造发明和合理建议支持不力。应该认识，任何一分技术力量的浪费，都是对国家建设的一个损失。利用某些借口，而把许多有专门技术的人长时期地放在不适当的工作岗位，使他们无法把自己的才能贡献给国家，这种现象决不容许继续存在。另一方面，我们也必须注意在工作中不断地提高科学技术人员的政治思想觉悟，使他们建立起全心全意为人民服务的观念，能够服从国家建设需要而不怕任何艰难困苦。
        （七）关于提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平问题
    人民革命和社会主义建设的最高目的，就是要不断地提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    全国解放以来，我国各民族人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平是逐步地提高的。在恢复时期的三年中，由于物价的稳定，就业人数的增加，工资的提高，农村中土地制度的改革，城乡人民的收入都有增加，人民的物质生活相当地改善了，文化生活也随着活跃起来了。少数民族人民由于政府对他们实行了扶助生产和发展贸易的政策，安定了社会的秩序，同时加强了文化和卫生的工作及其他有关措施，生活也都有了一定程度的改善。五年计划规定的各项指标和措施，如像我在报告的第二部分已经说过的那样，又将使全国人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平在原来的基础上有新的提高。
    五年计划所规定的关于提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平的指标，是我国目前可能实现的限度。我们不否认，我国人民目前的生活水平还是比较低的。但是，人民需要的满足决定于生产力的水平，决定于社会所拥有的现有物质资源，人民生活水平的提高必须建立在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上。我国工业农业的生产是逐年发展的，但目前生产的水平还是很低的；我国工业和运输业中的劳动生产率逐年都有提高，但劳动生产率的水平也还是不高的。我们要发展生产，并使生产的发展保持经常的高速度，为改善人民生活建立物质基础，就必须扩大重工业和其他各种事业的建设，这就不能把生产发展和劳动生产率提高的果实都用来改善生活，而必须把适当的部分作为资金，用来满足国家建设的需要。放在我们面前的是这样一个问题：用必要的财力来保证国家建设，以便建立人民生活改善的物质基础好呢？还是减少和推迟建设，而不合理地随便增加工资或者随意开销好呢？我们认为，从全国人民整体的长远的利益来考虑，应该首先用必要的财力来保证国家的建设，同时按照五年计划规定的指标来提高生活水平。因为建设的目的就是为了将来能够提高生活水平；没有今天的刻苦建设，就不可能有将来更加幸福的生活。那种认为可以不经过刻苦的建设而希望一下子把人民生活提得很高的想法和做法，是纯粹的幻想，是错误的。
       当然，国家机关和企业部门的所有工作人员，都应该随时随地关心人民群众的生活，在可能的条件下逐步地改善人民群众的生活。那种对人民生活采取漠不关心的态度，不注意解决那些必需解决而又可能解决的问题，是错误的。正确的做法是要把人民当前利益同长远利益结合起来，在保证国家建设的前提下，适当地提高人民生活水平。五年计划规定的提高人民物质生活和文化生活水平的指标和措施，必须尽可能地保证实现，使我国各族人民群众真正体验到国家建设的必要和对每个人的切身利害关系，从而更加积极地创造性地参加国家建设。
    人们曾经提出这样的问题：可否比五年计划所规定的指标更多地增加日常消费品的生产量，来更多地供应人民的需要？我们认为应该努力增产，也应该努力增加供应量。但是应该看到，由于就业人数还会增加，农民购买力还会提高，过去对这些消费品消费得少的人都可能要增加消费量，而全国人口有六万万之多，因此，实际上每个人平均所能增加的消费量暂时还是有限的。我们当然应该继续努力去发掘可能的生产潜力，忽视这种努力是不对的，但是，正如我们在前面所说的，工业原料的增产是暂时受着一定的限制的。农产品或者用农业原料制成的消费品的大量增产，只能在大规模地实现农业机械化和大规模地使用机器开荒之后。
    人们也曾经提出这样的问题：可否增加文化教育事业的设施，来适应人民在这方面越来越多的需要？我们认为应该采取更多的办法来适当地处理这个问题。我国的文化教育事业的各种指标，在一九五二年已经超过了解放以前的最高水平，在这个基础上，五年计划又规定了进一步发展的指标。但是，由于人民对文化生活提出了更高的要求，某些文化教育的设施就还不能完全适应人民的需要，如像小学不能完全适应学龄儿童入学的要求，中学不能完全适应小学毕业生升学的要求等等。为着处理这个问题，国家除了继续有计划地发展文化教育事业以外，提倡由人民来自办某些文化教育事业，如小学校、农民业余学校、业余剧团等；这些文化教育事业，国家将在工作上给以指导，并在可能的条件下给以人力、财力、物力方面的援助。同时，各地方各机关、各企业都应该尽可能地举办各种补习班、夜校、函授学校等等，而使那些不能升学的青年在劳动生产中继续提高文化水平。
    人民生活水平的提高只能是一种稳步前进的提高，人民的幸福要靠人民自己的辛勤劳动去取得。我们完全可以相信：经过六万万人克勤克俭的劳动，在进行几个五年计划大大地提高我国的生产力之后，就有可能大大地提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。这是我国人民提高生活水平的唯一的康庄大道，其他的捷径是没有的。
        （八）关于厉行节约问题
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是以大力发展重工业为中心的五年计划。建设重工业，必须长期地投入大量的建设资金。这种工业化所必需的资金是要依靠我国内部积累来取得的。因此，必须实行极严格的节约制度，消除一切多余的开支和不适当的非生产的开支，不能容许任何微小的浪费，以便积聚一切可能的资金，用来保证国家建设事业的需要，并增加国家必要的后备力量。
    斯大林在总结苏联第一个五年计划的时候曾经说过：“规定极严格节省的办法，积蓄为资助我国工业化所必需的经费，——这就是我们为达到建立重工业和实现五年计划目的所应走的道路。”苏联走过的这条道路，也就是我们现在应该走的道路。目前我国的国民经济，比苏联在实行第一个五年计划时期还要落后，我国建设资金的积累也就会比当时的苏联还要困难。厉行节约以积累建设资金，对我国就更加重要，更加迫切。因此，我们就非学习苏联人民当时节衣缩食刻苦建设的精神不可，就非继续发扬我国人民克勤克俭艰苦奋斗的优良传统不可。
    几年来，随着国家机关工作效率的不断提高，国营企业经营管理的不断改善，我们逐年地降低了建筑安装、生产、运输交通的成本和商品流转费用。这样就增加了国家建设资金的积累，减少了国家建设资金的浪费。这些成绩，无疑是应该加以肯定的。但是，我们不应该否认，目前我们有些方面、有些部门、有些地方、有些企业仍存在着很严重的浪费现象。有相当的一部分工作人员忘记了中国共产党的艰苦奋斗的革命传统，不了解在人民革命胜利后的社会主义工业化的建设仍需要我们长期的自我牺牲的努力，因而时常地破坏了国家的节约制度，破坏了经济核算制。毛泽东主席在“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”一文中指出：“节约是一切工作机关都要注意的，经济和财政工作机关尤其要注意。”为着建设社会主义，我们现在的任务，就是必须更加认真地执行毛泽东主席的这个指示，有效地建立各种节约制度，真正地学会用节约的方法来管理国家机关和国营企业，而在各个方面同一切的浪费现象作无情的斗争。
    首先，我们必须大大地削减非生产性建设的支出。几年来在非生产性的建设中，铺张浪费的现象是普遍而严重的。
    据国家统计局的材料：中央六个工业部在一九五三年和一九五四年的非生产性的投资占全部投资的百分之二十一点六，但苏联在第一个五年计划中，工业部门的非生产性投资只占全部投资的百分之十四点五。在一九五四年全国的基本建设投资中，非生产性的投资占百分之二十四点三。我们必须改变这种不合理的投资比例。
    在非生产性的房屋建筑中，由于忽视“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的原则，盲目地追求所谓“民族形式”，讲究豪华装饰，大量地采用贵重的或特殊的材料，造成了惊人的浪费。单就“大屋顶”来说，北京市内各机关建筑的三十九座房屋即因此浪费了五百四十万元。被人称为“地质宫”的长春地质学院校舍是一个很出名的豪华建筑，该院是利用伪满未建成的皇宫基础建设的，因为搞了好多不必要的装饰，每平方公尺造价为二百二十元，加上原有基础的造价则达三百元，超过国家规定造价一百二十五元的百分之
  一百四十。有些职工宿舍的造价也过高，例如鞍山钢铁公司在一九五三年修建的职工宿舍十五万平方公尺，单位造价高达一百六十三元。
    过分地增加装饰的结果，不但会使建筑物的造价大大增加，而且会使使用面积大大减少。北京有一个建筑物的主楼，每平方公尺的造价达二百九十三元，而使用面积只占百分之四十四。鞍钢设计大楼的造价高达二百四十元（比预算增高百分之六十，共浪费一百三十八万元），但使用面积还不到百分之五十。这些追求形式的豪华建筑，同时也无例外地都忽视了使用者的需要和利益，例如有一个疗养院的洗衣房，单位造价高达三百四十六元，安装上洗衣机后空隙太小，工人操作很不方便；其厨房面积四百五十平方公尺，单位造价高达二百七十五元，却无处存放米面。
    建筑了豪华的房子，就必须相应地购置豪华的室内设备，因之购置地毯、沙发等高级奢侈品的风气也随着发展。
    所有这类豪华的非生产性的建设，都是要不得的，都是同我们的社会主义工业化的建设方针不相符合的。
    很显然，削减上述这些非生产性建设的支出和克服其他的浪费，这将节约出一笔很大的资金。
    第二，我们必须大大地降低生产性建设的成本。
    有些工业建设单位不按照建设程序办事，不弄清情况，不进行有系统的准备工作，甚至建设方案尚未确定，就盲目备料，仓促施工，因而普遍地发生了浪费资金、积压器材的严重现象。例如有一个钢铁厂的改建工程，就是浪费的典型之一。当这个厂的改建规模还没有确定的时候，就开始了设计，设计没有作出，就进行施工，施工开始后，设计又经常发生重大的修改，致使施工图纸不能及时交付，或交了又作废，有些图纸交的先后和施工顺序颠倒，有的图纸注明“仅供参考”，都不能作为施工的依据。由于边设计、边施工，设计不断改变，施工计划也不断被打乱，这就造成有时窝工，有时赶工，而设备、材料就被积压。在这种情况下，工程进度想快反慢。该厂的建设工程还才开始，一九五四年完成的工作量还不到原定计划的一半，仅窝工开支就有二百万元，积压材料就达七百多万元。这种不作充分准备、不作好设计而进行施工的教训，必须引起一切基本建设单位的深刻注意。
    愈是重要的建设单位，浪费的可能性愈大。因为进行这些工程，常常是全国支援和不惜工本的，人们注意的是希望它建成，常常忽视和原谅它的浪费。第一汽车制造厂的建设到一九五四年十一月底为止，共积压器材一千零五十七万元，各种浪费如材料报废，设备损坏，大材小用，优材劣用，窝工，设计错误，以及管理不当等共计浪费六百三十万元。
    施工中的浪费，还表现在劳动组织得不好，机械设备的利用率低，建筑质量低，其结果必然是劳动生产率低，建筑成本高。
    很显然，降低生产性建设的成本，这也将节约出一笔很大的资金。
    第三，我们必须大大地加强各生产部门、运输交通部门和商业部门的经济核算制。
    我们有许多企业的产品质量是很不好的，废品是很多的。例如第一机械工业部有些厂，由于技术掌握不住，产品质量低劣，造成生产中大量返修和报废，一九五四年全年的铸件废品率为百分之十二点五（苏联的铸铁废品率为百分之五），报废的生铁达二万多吨，连同加工中的废品，全年共损失二千多万元。
    一九五五年第一季度内，许多产品质量不好，特别是重工业部和第一机械工业部所属企业的产品质量不好的现象较为普遍。在重工业部所属企业的产品中，第一季度生产的生铁，由于含硫过多而不合规格的达四千六百三十二吨；鞍钢生产的大型钢和桥梁钢，由于化学成分不合要求而有百分之三十不合规格；玻璃的生产，所有企业都没有完成一级品率的指标。在第一机械工业部所属企业的产品中，例如大连工矿车辆厂第一季度生产的五十吨敞车三百二十二辆中，由于性能达不到设计的要求，有百分之九十需要返工重修。特别是沈阳第二机床厂，该厂生产的三百八十台钻床，由于违反应有的试制程序，性能达不到设计的要求，全部需要返修，仅零件报废一项，即损失一百二十万元，以致从一九五四年九月起到一九五五年第一季度为止，都没有能够出产成品。犁铲的生产，由于犁铲的曲线不合要求，淬火后硬度达不到标准，致有百分之四十的产品是废品。在纺织产品中，纺织工业部第一季度内棉布和印染布的正品率计划都没有完成。轻工业部所属企业的某些产品，例如胶鞋、食糖等质量不稳定或下降的情况，也都比过去严重。
    我们有许多企业因为管理不善而浪费了很多资财。例如哈尔滨食品公司一九五四年一年中发生的浪费事件就有五十多次，有账可查的浪费数字就达五十七万元之多。一九五四年这个公司的畜产加工厂共亏损八十多万元，但究竟浪费损失多少，至今还是一笔糊涂账。
    在报上曾经发表过一个材料，商业部所属的一些企业在一九五四年曾经因为管理不善，单是死猪和臭蛋就值八百万元。
    我们还有很多企业，其中非生产人员过多，机构臃肿。例如本溪钢铁公司的生产工人只占职工总数的百分之五十六，管理机构人员约占职工总数的四分之一。这类的例子是不少的。据中国共产党北京市委员会调查：石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、清河制呢厂三个单位，可以减少三千六百多人，占三个单位职工总数的四分之一。
    很显然，加强各经济部门的经济核算制，从而减少浪费，减少废品，降低消耗定额，降低成本和流通费用，减少非生产人员，这也将节约出一笔很大的资金。
    第四，我们必须更进一步地缩减国家机关的行政管理费。
    几年来，国家机关的行政管理费，在国家整个支出中的比重是逐年降低的。但是，一直到现在，我们有许多国家机关还是人浮于事，人员太多，而且有的机关还在盲目地招收人员，这样就使得行政管理费难于更大地削减下来。根据精简机构、紧缩编制、调整干部的方针，现在已经决定从中央各机关起，开始整编的工作，有计划地从中央各机关中调出
  一批干部以加强下层和基层的生产单位。地方各级机关，也应该有步骤地来进行这种整编的工作。事实证明：凡属人员过多的机关，在减少一些人之后，非但不会减弱工作，而且会工作得更好一些。以后各机关需要增加的人员，应该加以严格的限制，而且应该尽可能地在原有的机关人员中进行调整。国家应该制定法令，规定所有公务人员（企业职工也在内）都必须遵守政府调动工作的命令。这样才可以合理地使用人力，节省国家的财力。
    至于许多国家机关还存在的许多铺张浪费的现象，那是必须立即禁止的。
    很显然，在精简机构和杜绝国家机关的许多铺张浪费的现象以后，这又将节约出一笔很大的资金。
    总之，今后国家必须在各方面建立一系列的节约制度和节约办法，规定那些是允许做的，那些是不允许做的。凡是那些不允许做的，如果做了，就是犯法。
    国务院规定：在今后三年内，生产性建设的建筑安装的造价，应该比原计划至少节约百分之十；各种非生产性建设的造价，应该比原计划至少节约百分之十五。同时，在这个基础上，不论生产性建设或非生产建设的成本，每年还应该力求降低百分之二到百分之三，或者更多些。这样，就将至少为国家节约二十亿元。这一笔资金，如用之于工业建设，就可以建设一个年产一百五十万吨钢铁的冶金企业，或三十个五万规模的电站，或五个年产一万五千辆拖拉机的工厂；如用之于铁路建设，则可以新建铁路三千公里以上；如用之于农业建设，则可以开荒四千万亩到五千万亩。由此可知，厉行节约对于我国的社会主义建设事业将起何等重大的作用。
    为着厉行全面的节约，必须严厉地批判各种反对节约、助长浪费的思想。
    一、必须批判那种“百废俱兴”的想法。因为所谓“百废俱兴”，就会使建设失去重点，而且因为把资金分散在过多的工程里面，结果将使工程建设的时间拖得太久，不能迅速地发挥投资的效果。
    二、必须批判那种认为“既要建设现代化的工业企业，则其他非生产性的建设和福利设施也就必须现代化”的想法。因为生活现代化应该先要有工业现代化的基础，还没有工业化的基础和农业的现代化，而过早地要求生活现代化，实际上就会推迟工业现代化。
    三、必须批判那种在预算上“宽打窄用”的想法。因为既然允许宽打，就一定不能窄用，宽打只能是宽用，结果就必然造成浪费。
    四、必须批判那种认为“建设经验不够，工作经验不够，浪费一点不可避免”的想法。因为主管工作的本人有了这种想法，那么浪费就一定不可避免。
    五、必须批判那种把浪费的事情一件一件地孤立起来看，而把浪费当作“小事情”的想法。现在这样的“小事情”，在任何一个工厂、企业，任何一个机关、学校，都是存在的，因为这叫做“小事情”，就天天熟视无睹。但是任何一项小的浪费，如果不加纠正，推算到整个部门、到全国，推算到一年、五年、十年、二十年，那就没有一项不是巨大的浪费。我们只有这样去观察“小事情”，才不致熟视无睹地继续浪费，才知道纠正这种“小事情”是大有必要，需要立即动手的。
    克服上述的一系列的错误思想，是开展节约运动的条件。
    国家必须加强财政监督，来保证节约制度的实施。不但财政部门要加强财政监察机构，各个企业部门和行政、军事部门也都要建立自己的财政监察机构。任何机关、任何人，都必须遵守财政制度，服从财政监察。任何机关、任何人，在浪费问题上，都不应该原谅自己，或者原谅旁人，或者用彼此原谅来代替彼此间的监督和检查。
    节约运动必须是全民的运动。全国人民首先是全体职工都要动员起来，积极地参加各个企业和机关的节约资金、反对浪费、监督财务的斗争。
        （九）关于苏联和各人民民主国家同我国建设的关系
    现在我来说一说苏联和各人民民主国家的国际援助同我国建设的关系。
    大家知道，我国所以能够这样迅速地实行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是同苏联和各人民民主国家的援助分不开的，特别是同苏联的援助分不开的。苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个工业建设单位，是我国第一个五年计划工业建设的中心。
    苏联对我国建设的援助是全面的和系统的。苏联援助我们建设的一百五十六个工业单位，从勘察地质，选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，进行设计，供应设备，指导建筑安装和开工运转，供应新种类产品的技术资料，一直到指导新产品的制造等等，总之是从头到尾全面地给予援助。苏联提供的设计，广泛地采用了最新的技术成就，苏联给我们的设备，都是第一流的、最先进的。为着帮助我们，伟大的苏联工人阶级用最高的劳动热情力求更快地和最好地制造我们所需要的设备，伟大的苏联政府尽先地把最好的设备供应我们。苏联政府和我国政府还签定了科学技术协定，通过这个协定，苏联对我国经济建设的帮助也是很大的。苏联政府主动地建议在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面，给予我国以科学、技术和工业上的帮助，并同我国签定了和平使用原子能的协定。
    苏联在繁忙的共产主义建设中抽出了大批的专家来帮助我们。他们给我们介绍了苏联社会主义建设的先进经验，具体地帮助我们进行各项经济工作。所有苏联派来我国的专家，不仅具有精湛的科学技术知识和丰富的实际工作经验，而且具有高度的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动态度。他们在我国工业、农业、林业、水利、铁路、交通、邮电、建筑、地质、教育、卫生以及其他各个部门中，在科学技术和文化的合作方面，忠诚无私地、毫无保留地将他们的经验、知识和技能贡献出来，他们把我国建设社会主义的伟大事业当作他们自己的事业一样看待。苏联专家们那种共产主义的劳动态度，已经成为我国人民学习的榜样。应该说，我们在经济建设中的重要成就，是同苏联专家的帮助分不开的。
    苏联用了很大的力量，帮助我国培养技术人材。苏联接受了我国大量的留学生和实习生，并且给予学习和实习的各种方便的条件，这对于我们掌握工业的近代技术、保证新建企业的开工生产以及提高我们的科学水平，是极关重要的。来我国的苏联专家，在培养我国的技术人材方面，也有很多的贡献。
    苏联政府给了我国重大的财政援助，以最优惠的条件陆续地贷款给我们，并且在两国之间的贸易关系上使我们得到廉价的技术装备和器材。这种贷款和贸易上的利益，也就帮助了我国经济的迅速恢复和发展，特别是帮助了我国的工业建设。
    由此可见，我国现在的建设所以能够有这样大的规模，有这样快的速度，有这样高的技术水平，并且还能够避免许多错误，苏联的援助起了极其重大的作用。
    除了苏联的援助以外，我国的建设还得到了波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国等人民民主国家在经济上和技术上的援助。同时，蒙古、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家同我国也有经济上的合作。
    英雄的朝鲜人民和英雄的越南人民，他们争取祖国的独立和自由的斗争，在全世界的和平民主的运动中占有重要的地位。他们的斗争，对于我国的建设事业也有着巨大的意义。
    中国政府和中国人民对苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，特别是对苏联的伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢。为着巩固和发展我国的社会主义建设事业，就必须进一步地巩固和发展我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济联盟和友好合作，以促进社会主义阵营经济的共同高涨，增强世界和平民主的力量。
    四、为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗
    我国第一个五年计划已经执行了两年。一九五三年和一九五四年两年计划执行的情况，基本上是好的，虽然在工作上、计划上暴露了若干错误和缺点。
    在工业农业总产值方面：一九五三年比一九五二年增长百分之十四点四，一九五四年又比一九五三年增长百分之九点四。两年平均每年增长百分之十一点九，超过五年计划规定的平均每年增长百分之八点六的速度。
    在基本建设方面：两年来基本建设计划，每年都接近完成。没有全部完成计划的原因是：设计所需要的基础资料的收集工作延迟了，设计工作赶不上，图纸、材料、设备不能按时供应，缺乏按照进度所需的切实的施工计划，施工现场还不够正规化，还有相当混乱的现象。
    两年实际完成的投资额（即工作量），占五年投资总额的百分之三十二。两年中投入生产的限额以上的工业建设单位有一百三十六个，新增生产能力举其重要的来说，有：钢四十二万七千吨，电五十三万瓩，煤一千三百万吨，水泥六十五万吨，纱锭七十万枚，纸四万吨，汽车轮胎十六万条，糖十万九千吨。两年中新建铁路铺轨一千四百多公里，其中集宁到二连的铁路和黎塘到湛江的铁路已经铺轨完成；新建公路六千六百多公里，其中主要的是康藏公路和青藏公路。两年中完成的重要水利工程有：淮河流域的三河节制闸和薄山水库，永定河的官厅水库和河北省的独流减河工程等。淮河流域的佛子岭水库也已基本完工。它们在一九五四年防御特大洪水的时候起了显著作用。两年中由国家建筑的各种房屋面积约七千八百余万平方公尺。
    在工业生产方面：两个年度计划都超额完成，一九五四年工业总产值比一九五二年增长了百分之五十三点七；重要产品的产量都有显著增长，如铁增长百分之五十六，钢增长百分之六十五，发电增长百分之五十一，煤增长百分之二十六，水泥增长百分之六十一，木材增长百分之一百一十一，棉布增长百分之三十七。两年国营工业的劳动生产率已提高百分之二十九，产品成本已降低百分之九点六。两年工业发展所引起的变化：第一是现代工业在工业农业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升到一九五四年的百分之三十三；第二是国营、合作社营、公私合营的工业的产值在工业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之六十一上升到一九五四年的百分之七十五点一。
    在农业生产方面：由于一九五三年许多地区的春旱秋涝和一九五四年许多地区遇到了特大的洪水，影响到两年农业生产都没有完成计划。但一九五四年的粮食产量，就全国范围来说，比一九五二年仍增长了百分之三点四，糖料、油料、烟叶等技术作物在两年中一般都有增加，只是棉花减产了。两年中农业生产合作社有了很大的发展，一九五四年底已发展到将近五十万个，为今后农业增产和农业合作化的进一步发展创造了有利的条件。
    在运输交通方面：两年铁路的货物周转量增长百分之五十五，旅客周转量增长百分之四十五；沿海和内河轮驳船的货物周转量增长百分之八十五；公路汽车货物周转量增长百分之一百七十五；民航和邮电的业务也有相当发展。
    在商业方面：一九五四年社会零售总额，比一九五二年大约增长百分之四十一点七。国营商业和合作社营商业在国内商业批发中所占的比重，由一九五二年的百分之六十三上升到一九五四年的百分之八十九；在社会零售中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之三十四上升到一九五四年的百分之五十八。
    在文化教育和保健方面：一九五四年比一九五二年，高等学校在校学生人数增长百分之三十三，普通中学在校学生人数增长百分之四十四，小学两年来着重整顿巩固，在校学生人数也有增长。一九五四年比一九五二年医院病床增长百分之三十四。
    两年来，国营、合作社营、公私合营的企业和文化教育事业、国家机关的工人职员总数共增加大约三百万人，除去由私营转入公私合营和国营企业的工人职员，实增约二百万人；全国工资总额共增长百分之五十六，工人职员平均工资以货币计算增长百分之十四。农民从农业和副业所得到的收入，两年增长约百分之七。
    以上情况说明，一九五三年和一九五四年的年度计划，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的指导下，经过全国人民的努力，已经胜利地实现。完成和争取超额完成五年计划所规定的各种指标，是完全有可能的。帝国主义者和反动派曾经一再无耻地散布谎言，说中国没有可能实现工业化，或者说五年计划已经失败。但是，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下已经而且将继续用灿烂的事实向全世界证明：我们不但有力量完成伟大的人民民主革命的任务，而且有力量完成更伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务。
    当然，我国第一个五年计划，不论那一方面的任务，都是很艰巨的。后三年的任务要比前两年更为艰巨。一九五五年到一九五七年，基本建设要完成五年投资总额的百分之六十八，许多规模巨大、技术复杂的工厂、矿山、铁路、水利的工程要同时开工；工业总产值要在一九五四年的基数上增长百分之二十九，许多技术复杂的新种类产品要试制成功和大量生产；农业生产的任务是很紧张的，以一九五四年为基数，粮食产量要增长百分之十三点七，即增产四百六十六亿斤，棉花产量要增长百分之五十三点五，即增产一千一百四十万担；铁路货物周转量要在一九五四年基数上增长百分之三十，公路汽车和水路的运输任务也很繁重；根据社会购买力估算，社会商品零售额要比一九五四年增长百分之二十七。文化教育、科学研究、卫生等方面的工作任务，在后三年也是很艰巨的。对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的工作，要求更加深入和细致，并且应该根据统筹兼顾的方针，对私营经济加以统一安排。以上种种，说明后三年是五年计划中最关重要的年份，只有完满地做好后三年的工作，才能全部完成五年计划。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国在原来生产力薄弱的基础上进行大规模的建设工作，是不能够不遇到困难的。我们的工作是十分紧张的。在过去的两年多中，我们已经克服了许多困难，完成了许多艰巨复杂的工作任务，但今后我们还会遇到各种困难，工作任务也将更艰巨更复杂。我们必须充分地估计到技术人材、设备供应同建设需要的矛盾而发生的困难，农业落后于工业的迅速发展而发生的困难，以及在社会主义改造过程中各种经济成份统筹安排的困难。面对着这些困难，我们必须最合理地和最有效地利用人力、物力和财力，加强各方面的工作和采取适当的办法，加以克服。对于国内外敌人，我们必须随时地保持充分的警惕，战胜他们的破坏和反抗。同时，由于我们的计划工作经验缺乏和统计资料不全，这就不能不影响到计划的准确性。因此，在计划执行过程中，我们必须随时注意计划工作和实际的发展情况相结合，从而根据实际的经验，根据广大群众的创造性的经验，来不断地使计划能够比较准确和比较完善。
    第一个五年计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。胜利地完成第一个五年计划，将使我们在实现过渡时期总任务的道路上得到一个具有决定意义的胜利。因此，全国人民，必须在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，团结起来，动员起来，兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约，为全部实现五年计划而奋斗。
    在实现五年计划的斗争中，全国工人阶级发挥积极性和创造性，不断地提高劳动生产率和降低成本，具有首要的意义。为了达到这一目的，就需要努力提高工人职员群众的政治觉悟、技术文化水平和业务水平，展开劳动竞赛，巩固劳动纪律，学习和推广先进经验，使广大的工人职员成为全面地完成国家计划而斗争的积极战士。
    大家知道：发展国民经济的五年计划不仅是工业的计划，同时是农业和其他所有经济部门的计划。因此，所有的国营企业、合作社营企业、公私合营企业、私营企业的工人职员以及手工业者、手工业工人的劳动，所有的国营农场职工、农业生产合作社社员、个体农民、牧民和渔民的劳动，所有的国家经济工作部门，包括工业、农业、林业、水利、铁道、交通、邮电、商业、粮食、财政、金融各工作部门的工作人员的劳动，都是完成五年计划所必须互相配合而不可少的劳动，都是光荣的劳动。正因为这样，不但国营企业、合作社营企业和国营农场的工人职员，负有完成五年计划为他们规定的指标的责任，而且公私合营和私营企业的工人职员以及一切从业人员，农业生产合作社社员和个体农民，手工业者和手工业工人，国家经济工作部门的工作人员，都同样负有完成五年计划为他们规定的任务的责任。只有全国人民群众都完成生产任务，才能全部完满地实现第一个五年计划。
    工业和农业是国民经济的两个主要部门，工人和农民是全国最大多数的劳动者。工农联盟是我国人民革命获得伟大胜利的基础，加强和巩固在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，是完成第一个五年计划争取社会主义胜利的基础。因此，我们必须依靠工农联盟这个基本的社会力量，来充分地发挥我国经济上一切可能的潜在力量，同时准备必要的后备力量，以便使我国第一个五年计划的胜利完成得到可靠的保证。
    大家又知道：我们在工业、农业和其他经济部门方面的一切经济工作，并不是孤立地进行的，它们必须有教育、文化、卫生、司法、监察、公安、民政、外交、国防等项工作的配合。因此，所有在这些方面服务的人员的劳动，包括文化卫生事业中一部分自由职业者的劳动，也都是五年计划中必不可少的劳动。认真地做好他们自己的工作，也就是完成五年计划中他们所应当担负的任务。中国人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员，担负着保卫祖国和保卫社会主义建设的光荣的重大的责任。几年以来，在工业、农业、运输交通、商业等经济战线上出现了许多劳动模范和先进工作者，在文化和教育的战线上也出现了许多劳动模范和先进工作者，在各个行政工作部门也有许多模范工作者，这是我们国家的荣誉。所有的劳动模范和先进工作者，都应该进一步地发挥自己高度的积极性和创造性，更好地完成自己所担负的任务，在群众中起带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，团结和带领着广大群众，为超额完成五年计划而奋斗。在实现五年计划的斗争中，科学、技术工作者担负着重大的责任。社会主义建设事业迫切要求科学和技术，没有科学和技术就不能建设社会主义。因此，不论在那一部门工作的科学研究人员和工程技术人员，都应该不断地提高政治思想水平和科学技术水平，加强理论同实际的联系，注意研究工作同生产工作的联系，在社会主义建设事业中充分发挥科学和技术的作用，把每个人的智慧贡献给国家和人民。
    青年和妇女都应该积极地参加祖国的社会主义建设事业。青年们应该锻炼身体，学习文化和科学知识，养成劳动习惯和良好的道德品质，做好工作，为建设和保卫祖国服务。妇女们也应该提高政治觉悟，提高生产和工作的能力，积极地参加国家建设事业。
    五年计划同全国各民族各阶层人民都有密切的关系。五年计划要求国内各民族更巩固地团结起来，要求国内各民族加强经济和文化的联系和合作。各民族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，应该积极地参与整个国家的政治生活和经济建设事业，共同努力来建设我们的祖国。同时，按宪法的规定来实现少数民族的区域自治，努力发展少数民族地区的经济和文化教育事业，加强医疗卫生工作，汉族人民必须在经济上和文化上给各兄弟民族以真心诚意的帮助，以逐步地改善各少数民族人民的生活。各少数民族的社会主义改造，应该根据本民族历史发展的特点，尊重人民自己的意愿。
    由于我国的特殊历史条件，工人阶级同民族资产阶级在政治上和经济上存在着联盟的关系。在过渡时期，民族资产阶级在国民经济中还有重要的作用。工商业资本家在五年计划中的责任，就是应该服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，接受工人群众的监督，经营有利于国计民生的事业，老老实实地服从国家计划，做好国家委托的任务，接受社会主义改造。这样，他们就能够正确地发挥他们在五年计划中的应有作用，而对五年计划作出一定的贡献。
   华侨是热爱祖国的，他们希望祖国的繁荣和强盛。国家应该注意保护华侨正当的权利和利益，同时，华侨也应该进一步地团结起来，积极地参与祖国的建设事业。
    要完满地完成五年计划，不但必须有全国范围的方针、政策、步骤的统一领导，而且必须有地方各级国家机关和党组织的具体措施，来实现计划规定的当地任务特别是关于农业生产的任务。地方各级国家机关和党组织不仅必须负责管理地方的各种经济事业和文化教育事业，而且必须管理自己管辖区域内属于中央的工厂、矿山、基本建设工地、经济企业、文化机关的政治工作和党的工作，检查这些企业和机关对于国家计划的执行程度，监督和帮助它们完成计划。散在各地的中央所属的企业、机关必须服从地方国家机关和党组织的领导，在它们当中如果有不服从地方领导的倾向，那就必须进行严肃的斗争加以纠正。国务院所属的各部必须充分地依靠地方领导机关的积极性，来实现国家的计划。
      为了胜利地向前推进我们的事业，一切共产党员，一切国家机关的工作人员，一切企业部门的工作干部，都应该进一步地改进工作作风，努力克服工作中的各种缺点和错误。毫无疑问，我们绝大多数的共产党员和国家机关的工作人员，是勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的，是积极努力地去完成党和国家及人民群众委托的工作任务的，是能够联系群众和进行自我批评的。但并不能否认，有一些共产党员和国家机关的工作人员，他们由于满足于已有的成绩，已经滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，不愿揭露和克服工作中的缺点和错误；他们不能深入下层进行具体领导，而是采取官僚主义、文牍主义的方法来进行一般化的领导，对自己所担负的工作和国家的财产不负责任。甚至还有这样一些人，他们为了达到个人的目的，夸大自己的工作成绩，隐瞒工作中的错误和缺点，包庇违犯党纪国法的行为。很明显，如果我们不同这种不良的倾向进行坚决的斗争，我们的事业就不能前进，五年计划就不能胜利实现。因此，党和国家要求全体共产党员和工作人员，特别是领导干部，忠诚老实地履行对党和国家的责任，以身作则，勤俭刻苦，努力钻研业务，提高政治水平，深入下层，深入群众，调查研究情况，具体地解决工作中存在的实际问题，揭露和克服工作中的缺点和错误，督促和帮助所属单位更好地完成国家计划。
    我们已经开始了巨大规模的建设，我们的经验不够，我们的技术水平不高，如果我们不认真地学习经济工作和其他有关的工作，我们就不能顺利地完成五年计划。我们应该一方面在生产和工作中学习，总结自己的经验，提高自己的能力，一方面吸收世界上一切先进的知识，合理地运用到生产和工作中去。我们要向所有的兄弟国家学习，特别是要向苏联学习，向苏联专家学习。人们经常谈论着对于苏联和各兄弟国家的援助的感谢。由于苏联和各兄弟国家伟大的无私的援助，人们这种感谢心情是完全自然的。但是感谢苏联和各兄弟国家的最好的办法，不是别的，是学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，是学会苏联和各兄弟国家的专家在建设中所教给我们的知识，来全部实现国家的五年计划。我们现在的建设比之当年苏联的条件有利得多，因为苏联曾经单独一个国家在资本主义包围中建设社会主义，而我们却已经有了经验很多、技术很高的苏联和各兄弟国家的援助。我们应该充分利用这种有利条件来进行学习，以便在几个五年计划之后，把我国的建设经验和科学技术提高到应有的水平。
    我们必须学会做经济工作，同时必须做好政治工作，经常地向广大群众宣传马克思列宁主义，宣传党在各个时期的政策，宣传中华人民共和国宪法。一切担负领导工作的干部，都应该认真地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习毛泽东主席的著作，批判资产阶级的思想，不断地提高理论水平，以便把工作做得更好。
    实现五年计划，是在现在环境下的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。五年计划的完全实现，将使我国的工业和全部国民经济有巨大的发展，将使社会主义经济成份的比重大大增加，非社会主义经济成份的比重很大缩小。这也就是说，以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政将更加巩固。所有这些，全国人民和我们在全世界的朋友都将为之欢欣鼓舞。可是人民的胜利就是人民的敌人的失败，就是帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团、一切敌视人民的分子的反革命复辟企图的失败。人民的敌人是决不愿意自己失败的，他们必然千方百计地来破坏我们的五年计划。美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团正在进一步对我们进行战争的威胁；隐藏在大陆上的蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子经常进行各种破坏活动；一些地主和反革命分子正在利用我们工作中的某些缺点，来煽动群众；某些不法资本家也在采取各种手段对社会主义改造进行抵抗。所有这些都说明，人民的敌人将采取各种方法来破坏五年计划，而实现五年计划是一种复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争。全国人民必须时时刻刻地提高政治的警惕性，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，击破国内外敌人和反动分子对于五年计划任何形式的破坏。曾经有不少的国家机关和企业部门的工作人员，对于暗藏的敌人的破坏活动，麻痹大意，对于反革命分子所造成的各种事故，熟视无睹，这种倾向是很危险的，必须立即纠正。最近对于胡风反革命集团的揭露，是全国人民在同反革命阴谋的斗争中所取得的一个重大的胜利。
    中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量，中国共产党的团结是全国人民团结的核心。中国共产党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，始终保持着巩固的牢不可破的团结。特别在党的七届四中全会以后，揭露了和粉碎了高岗、饶漱石的反党联盟，党就更加团结和更加巩固了。高岗、饶漱石是帝国主义和资产阶级在我们党内的代理人，反对高岗、饶漱石反党活动的斗争，是一次保卫共产党、保卫社会主义建设、保卫共产主义的斗争。粉碎高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的伟大胜利，是我们在进行社会主义建设中的一个伟大胜利。这个胜利证明了中国共产党的团结一致，并将进一步地巩固这种团结。当然，中国共产党为着不断地加强党的团结，将继续提高警惕，注意和粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋诡计，同一切不利于党的团结的言论行动进行坚决的斗争，纠正某些共产党员骄傲自满的情绪，更加团结一致地和更加坚强地领导全国人民，为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的任务而斗争。
    毛泽东主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕的时候曾经指示，“我们的总任务是：团结全国人民，争取一切国际朋友的支援，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。”根据毛泽东主席的这个指示，我们必须在中国共产党的领导下，巩固全国各族人民的团结，巩固工人阶级同农民的团结，巩固人民民主统一战线。同时，在全党和全国人民巩固的团结的基础上，我们将进一步地加强同伟大的盟国苏联和各人民民主国家的团结，以进一步地加强保卫世界和平的力量。我国也将进一步地加强同亚洲、非洲所有爱好和平的国家的友好合作。根据有名的和平共处五项原则，我国已经同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚建立了友好合作的关系。我国愿意根据同样的原则，同世界上任何国家建立和平合作的关系，扩大经济和文化的联系，只要这些国家也具有同样的愿望和诚意。中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，就是保障本国的独立、自由、主权和领土完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。我们将坚持不懈地参加一切为缓和国际局势而进行的斗争。世界各国人民争取和平、民主和自由的运动，在实际上援助了我国的建设。凡是爱好和平、民主和自由的人民，当然是必须互相援助的。
    各位代表！我国第一个五年计划是一个伟大的计划，它将开始改变我国百年来经济落后的历史，把我国向工业化的社会主义社会的目标推进一步。像毛泽东主席所说的：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”我们每一个人的责任是重大的，我们的经验又不够，我们必须勤勤恳恳地做工作，同时又必须具有像过去那样不怕困难、百折不回、争取革命胜利的精神。我们有中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，国家对内对外的政策是正确的，只要我们全国各族人民群众、各民主阶级、各民主党派、一切爱国人士团结起来，努力奋斗，我们就一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
