Strike Movements of Workers in Capitalist Countries
    Over 1.2 Million Workers in Chile Hold General Strike
    According to a resolution by the Chilean Workers' United Center, employees of Chilean state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises announced a 24-hour general strike in solidarity with striking transport workers demanding wage increases and a halt to rising prices. Currently, over 1.2 million workers in Chile are participating in the strike (the population of Chile is approximately six million).
    According to a United Press reporter, on the evening of July 6th, workers in the Chilean capital, Santiago, organized demonstrations demanding that authorities take measures to curb rising prices. This was the largest demonstration in Chilean history. The government deployed tanks and troops to the capital, and "the capital of Chile has virtually become a military camp."
    Clotario Blest, president of the Chilean Workers' United Center, sharply criticized the government's policies, demanded that the government revise its economic and fiscal policies, and called on participants in the demonstrations to continue their struggle to improve their living and working conditions. He said that if the government does not meet the workers' demands, Chilean workers will hold another general strike within the next ten days.
    Strike of 60,000 U.S. Mining and Smelting Workers Continues
    The strike by over 60,000 members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers in the United States has continued for seven days. According to a "Wall Street Journal" reporter, due to the strike, domestic copper smelting in the United States has decreased by 60%. Copper mines in Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada have been closed, and copper smelting plants in many other states have also been closed.
    French Working Class Launches Extensive Strike Struggle
    The French working class is launching an extensive strike struggle. Striking workers are demanding higher wages, an end to oppression against striking workers, and the reinstatement of workers fired for participating in strikes, etc.
    The largest-scale strike struggle has occurred among metalworkers. The strike by metalworkers at the "Citroen" automobile factories in Levallois and Saint-Ouen has continued for three days. 3,500 people are participating in the strike. They are demanding paid vacations and a 20% wage increase.
    The strike by metalworkers in Gennevilliers has continued for fourteen days. Because the factory management of a local factory refused to meet the strikers' demands, the workers passed a resolution to continue the struggle. Residents of the city are providing financial and food assistance to the striking workers.
    The 3,000 workers at the Sidélor steel plant in Homécourt, who have been on strike for more than two weeks, have achieved a preliminary victory. The factory's management has agreed to meet many of the strikers' demands. Therefore, the factory resumed work on July 7th.
    Victory for Singapore Harbor Board Employees' Strike
    Singapore News: According to Western news agencies, 1,300 employees of the Singapore Harbor Board have won many of their demands after persisting in their strike for more than sixty days. The Singapore Harbor Board has agreed to twelve of the fifteen demands put forward by the employees for improving living standards and working conditions, and has changed its attitude of refusing to negotiate the remaining three demands, agreeing on the 5th to resolve them through arbitration.
    End of Strike by Dockworkers in Six Major British Ports
    On July 4th, under pressure from the leadership of the National Dock Labour Board, 18,000 dockworkers in six of Britain's largest ports, who had been on strike for six weeks, returned to work. Their main demand was not met, which was to have the port authorities fully recognize the union's right to negotiate wages and working conditions for dockworkers representing the five northern ports.
    The union's leadership adopted a compromise and wavering stance. The strike was able to continue for so long solely due to the persistence, resilience and unity of the union's rank-and-file members. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    资本主义国家工人的罢工运动
    智利全国一百二十多万职工举行总罢工
    根据智利工人统一工会的决议，智利国营的工业和贸易企业的职工宣布总罢工二十四小时，以声援要求增加工资和制止物价上涨的运输业职工的罢工。现在智利总共有一百二十多万职工在举行罢工（智利的人口约为六百万人）。
    据合众社记者报道，七月六日晚间，智利首都圣地亚哥的职工组织了示威游行，要求当局采取措施制止物价上涨。这是智利有史以来最大的一次示威游行。政府把坦克和军队调到首都，于是“智利的首都实际上已经变成了一个兵营”。
    智利工人统一工会主席克洛塔里奥·布勒斯特尖锐抨击政府的政策，要求政府修改经济和财政政策，并且号召参加示威游行的人继续为改善生活和劳动条件而斗争。他说，如果政府不满足工人的要求，智利工人将在最近十天内再一次举行总罢工。
    美国六万名开采和冶炼工人罢工在坚持中
    美国国际开采冶炼工人工会六万多名会员的罢工已继续七天。据“华尔街日报”记者报道，由于这次罢工，美国国内铜的冶炼已经减少百分之六十。犹他州、新墨西哥州、亚利桑那州和内华达州的铜矿已经关闭，国内其他许多州的炼铜工厂也关闭了。
    法国工人阶级展开广泛的罢工斗争
    法国工人阶级正在展开广泛的罢工斗争。罢工工人要求提高工资、取消对罢工工人的压迫、恢复因参加罢工而被解雇的工人的工作等等。
    在五金工人中间发生了最大规模的罢工斗争。勒伐勒瓦和圣多昂的“雪铁龙”汽车工厂的五金工人的罢工已经连续了三天。参加罢工的有三千五百人。他们要求给予工资照发的假期，要求提高工资百分之二十。
    谷诺圃的五金工人的罢工已经连续了十四天。因为当地一家工厂厂方拒绝答应罢工者的要求，工人们通过了继续斗争的决议。这一城市的居民给罢工工人以金钱和食物上的援助。
    罢工两个多星期的奥梅古的西戴洛冶金厂的三千名工人已经取得了初步胜利，这个工厂的资方已经答应满足罢工者的许多要求。因此，这一工厂七月七日复工了。
    新加坡海港局职工的罢工斗争获得胜利
    新加坡消息：据西方通讯社报道，新加坡海港局职工一千三百人，在坚持罢工六十多天以后，已经赢得了他们提出的许多要求。新加坡海港局已经答应了职工们所提出的改善生活待遇和劳动条件的十五条要求中的十二条，并且改变了拒绝谈判其余三条要求的态度，而于五日答应通过仲裁来解决。
    英国六大港口码头工人罢工结束
    七月四日，在英国全国码头工人工会联合会领导机构的压力下，罢工已经六个星期的英国六个最大港口的一万八千名码头工人复工了。他们的主要要求并没有得到满足，这就是要港口管理当局完全承认这个工会有代表北部五个港口的码头工人谈判工资和劳动条件问题的权利。
    工会的领导机构采取了妥协和动摇的立场。罢工所以能继续这样久，仅仅是由于这个工会的普通会员的坚持不屈和团结一致。（据新华社讯）
