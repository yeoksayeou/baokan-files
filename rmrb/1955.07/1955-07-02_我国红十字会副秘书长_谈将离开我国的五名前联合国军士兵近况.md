Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Our reporter interviewed the Chinese Red Cross today regarding the recent situation of the former UN soldiers, Lewis Griggs and the other four, who are about to leave China. The Vice Secretary-General of the association, Lin Shixiao, received the reporter.

Vice Secretary-General Lin Shixiao told the reporter that the Chinese Red Cross began contacting the Indian Red Cross in early June regarding some necessary arrangements for the five to leave China. Recently, they received a reply from the Indian Red Cross on June 24, stating that the association had contacted the relevant countries and would notify the Chinese Red Cross of the progress. It is believed that specific results will be obtained from the Indian Red Cross soon. Once the negotiations are settled, they can leave China.

Regarding their recent situation in Beijing, Vice Secretary-General Lin Shixiao said: They arrived in Beijing on June 7. The Chinese Red Cross provided them with food, accommodation, and pocket money, and helped them make necessary clothing. Unfortunately, in the first few days after their arrival in Beijing, it was discovered that some of them often did not return at night and were drinking heavily outside. For their safety, the Chinese Red Cross advised them and hoped that they would return to their residence before 12 o'clock every night and not drink heavily outside. However, they did not accept this well-intentioned advice. In the twenty-odd days after arriving in Beijing, they have repeatedly engaged in behaviors that endanger public security, such as causing trouble while drunk, picking quarrels and fighting, verbally abusing police officers, and molesting women. Louis Verdine was summoned and detained by the Beijing Public Security Bureau on the night of June 19 for endangering public security. Otto Bell admitted to cutting his own skin with a knife, pretending to commit suicide in an attempt to coerce; and took pictures of the scars, claiming that he would use them as proof of his mistreatment in China after leaving China. On the night of June 22, he hurled abuse and provocation at passersby and police officers on duty, threatened to beat people, and resisted the summons of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. On June 29, he was detained by the Public Security Bureau and admitted that his above-mentioned behavior was wrong. These behaviors of theirs have aroused dissatisfaction from the Beijing Public Security Bureau and the citizens of Beijing. Vice Secretary-General Lin Shixiao pointed out that when the Chinese Red Cross accepted these American prisoners of war who refused repatriation to live in China, it had the responsibility to give an explanation to the international political conference that will discuss the Korean issue in the future. Now that they are about to leave China, the Chinese Red Cross cannot but be concerned about their safety; if the current situation continues, the Chinese Red Cross will not be able to take responsibility for their safety. Therefore, the Chinese Red Cross has obtained the consent of the Beijing Public Security Bureau to assist in managing them before they leave China. China has always adopted a responsible attitude towards its international obligations. As long as these foreign prisoners of war who refuse repatriation are still in China, the Chinese Red Cross will fulfill its due responsibilities.

### 我国红十字会副秘书长　谈将离开我国的五名前联合国军士兵近况

　　我国红十字会副秘书长
　　谈将离开我国的五名前联合国军士兵近况
    新华社一日讯　本社记者今天向中国红十字会采访关于将要离开中国的前联合国军士兵刘易斯·格里格斯等五人的最近情况，由该会副秘书长林士笑接见。
    林士笑副秘书长告诉记者说，关于他们五人离开中国的一些必要安排，中国红十字会在六月初开始同印度红十字会进行接洽，最近接到印度红十字会六月二十四日的复电，该会已向有关国家进行接触，并将以发展情况通知中国红十字会。相信最近就可以从印度红十字会获知具体的结果。一等到接洽妥当，他们就可以离开中国。
    关于他们最近在北京的情况，林士笑副秘书长说：他们是六月七日来到北京的，由中国红十字会供给他们的食宿零用，并资助他们做了必要的服装。令人遗憾的是，在他们到京后的最初几天，就发现他们经常有人深夜不归，在外酗酒。为了他们的安全，中国红十字会曾向他们劝告，并希望他们每晚十二时以前回到住所，并且不要在外酗酒。但是，他们不接受这种善意的劝告。在到达北京以后的二十几天里，他们之中曾经不断发生妨害治安的行为，例如酗酒闹事、寻衅打人、辱骂警官、调戏妇女，等等。路易·弗尔迪涅在六月十九日夜就因为妨害治安的行为被北京市公安局传讯拘留。奥托·贝尔自认曾经用小刀划破自己的皮肤，佯装自杀，企图要挟；并拍了伤痕的相片，扬言要在离开中国后作为他受中国虐待的证明。六月二十二日夜，他在街上向过路的市民和执行任务的警察谩骂挑衅，威胁打人，并抗拒北京市公安局的传讯，二十九日被公安局拘留，承认了他的上述行为是不对的。他们的这些行为已经引起北京市公安局和北京市民的不满。林士笑副秘书长指出，中国红十字会在接受这些拒绝遣返的美国战俘来中国居住的时候，负有向将来讨论朝鲜问题的国际政治会议对他们作出交代的责任。现在，他们即将离开中国，中国红十字会对于他们的安全不能不关心；如果让目前的情况继续下去，中国红十字会势将无法负责他们的安全。因此，中国红十字会已经商得北京市公安局的同意，在他们离开中国以前，由北京市公安局协助管理他们。中国对于它所承担的国际义务，一向采取负责的态度，只要这些拒绝遣返的外国战俘还在中国一天，中国红十字会就要负起它应负的责任。
