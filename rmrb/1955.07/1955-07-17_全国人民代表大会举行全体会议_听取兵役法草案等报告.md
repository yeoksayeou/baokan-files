Xinhua News Agency, 16th. On the morning of the 16th, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued group discussions on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan.

Many delegates pointed out in the discussions that the reason why our country has been able to implement the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy so rapidly is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, especially from the assistance of the Soviet Union. Some delegates, based on their experience in practical work and the results of their recent inspections in various places, excitedly pointed out that many key factories and mines built with the help of the Soviet Union in our country were built according to the most advanced designs and with the latest technology and equipment. They also specifically talked about the sincere and selfless assistance of a large number of Soviet experts in our country's construction. Many delegates emphasized in their speeches the importance of learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building socialism and learning from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology. They believe that the 156 construction units designed by the Soviet Union to help our country are schools for us to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology, and we must carry out this learning in a more planned and organized manner.

Many delegates mentioned that as the socialist construction cause is developing more and more, there will be more and more new factories and new machines in our country. In order to manage the new factories and master the new technologies, it is very important to train a large number of engineering and technical personnel with modern scientific knowledge who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the cause of socialism, and to train skilled workers and specialized talents in various fields. They believe that the indicators and measures for training technical personnel and building cadres stipulated in the draft of the First Five-Year Plan are very correct. Many delegates engaged in cultural and educational work pointed out in their speeches that cultural and educational workers have a particularly important responsibility in this regard.

In the group discussions in recent days, the speeches of the army delegates emphasized the importance of giving priority to the development of heavy industry for consolidating national defense and promoting the modernization of national defense. They all expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland.

Many minority delegates have also enthusiastically supported our country's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in their speeches in the past few days. They believe that after the implementation of this plan, the rich resources of minority areas will also be gradually developed, and the economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of minority areas will be gradually developed, which precisely reflects the common interests and wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

The Overseas Chinese delegation believed in the discussion that the First Five-Year Plan is in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese compatriots. It will make our motherland increasingly prosperous and strong, which is exactly what overseas Chinese compatriots urgently hope for. The Overseas Chinese delegates expressed that they will mobilize all overseas Chinese compatriots to actively support and participate in the construction of the motherland.
