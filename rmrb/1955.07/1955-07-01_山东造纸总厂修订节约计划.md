　　Shandong Paper Mill Revises Savings Plan
　　Chen Hualu
    The Shandong Paper Mill has revised its cost-saving plan several times. The first target was more than 175,000 yuan, the second was more than 349,000 yuan, and the third was 554,000 yuan. The factory director said with confidence: We will exceed it again.
    At the end of March this year, after receiving instructions from the Ministry of Light Industry on saving, the leaders and managers of the Shandong Paper Mill began to deliberate. At that time, everyone believed that this year's plan was more advanced than any previous year, with costs reduced by nearly 11.5 percent compared to last year's plan. The completion of the plan in the first quarter was also good. Discarded fishing nets and rope ends were also used as raw materials to make good paper. Although there was waste, "the old factory doesn't have big problems." Therefore, the planning department, in consultation with relevant departments, finalized the plan.
    In April, the Ministry of Light Industry held a national factory director conference. The director of Shandong Paper Mill heard the leaders of the ministry repeatedly emphasize at the meeting: We must look forward. He also listened to the reports of brother factories and thought that other factories were making rapid progress. For example, in terms of unit pulp consumption, paper mills in Shanghai used only over 820 kilograms of pulp per ton of cigarette paper, and paper mills in Anhui also used only over 850 kilograms, while their own factory used over 900 kilograms; for glazed paper, some factories used only over 900 kilograms, while their own factory used 1,040 or 1,050 kilograms. In comparison, it seemed backward. The factory director also studied the production situation. He found that although the cost plan for the first quarter was overfulfilled by 3.88 percent, saving more than 70,000 yuan, it was 0.29 percent higher than the actual cost in the fourth quarter of last year. Among the 137 quotas, 53 were not completed. If the backward factors were eliminated, there would be much more income than now. After the factory director returned to the factory, he told everyone about these situations, and many people felt that their past pride, complacency, and conservative thinking were too serious, and they requested to revise the plan.
    Some people verbally and theoretically support key construction projects and agree to accumulate more funds for socialist industrialization, but they are unwilling to make the plan more advanced. The Shandong Paper Mill encountered such people in the process of revising the plan and quotas. For example, the actual harvest rate of sunflower hemp is 59.26 percent on average, and it reached 63.9 percent in January. However, the person responsible for making the plan only set the harvest rate at 59 percent. Their reason was: The hemp is not good now, and the harvest rate is low. This is a fact, but how to strive to improve the supply and processing of hemp to increase the harvest rate? They did not consider it. It was only changed to 60 percent during the workers' discussion. The waste fish harvest rate actually reached 43.12 percent in the first quarter, but the person making the plan only set it at 43 percent. Their reason was that the nets bought were getting worse and worse. Regarding the use of substitutes, the person making the plan thought that they could not be used more, because substitutes such as rope ends and fish nets were not easy to buy. However, after the factory leaders' criticism and help in analysis, they realized that substitutes could be bought and used more, and decided to use all substitutes to make cigarette paper in the fourth quarter, which could save more than 190,000 yuan, and the good hemp saved could be used where the country needs it most.
    It is very important for leaders to grasp the key points and keys of savings from a comprehensive analysis and mobilize the masses to break through them. However, small, common, and widespread waste cannot be ignored. The leaders of the Shandong Paper Mill did not have enough understanding of this point before, thinking that a little bit of waste was nothing. It was not until later, when they comprehensively reviewed the plan and helped the workshops calculate accounts and formulate measures plans, that they began to pay attention to small waste and also grasp small savings. This attention revealed huge potential. After a little calculation, the Third Paper-making Workshop could save at least another 15,000 yuan. The factory headquarters did not stipulate savings targets for the pulping workshop, and the workers automatically proposed saving more than 13,000 yuan. The savings target given by the factory headquarters to the Second Paper-making Workshop was more than 244,000 yuan. After paying attention to small savings, this workshop increased it by more than 57,000 yuan. The oiling workers only needed to "add oil diligently, add less oil, and prevent splashing" when oiling, and the monthly consumption of machine oil was reduced from 150 jin to 50 jin. The workers in the papermaking section originally thought that the Shandong Paper Mill was a "big tree with plenty of shade," and it didn't matter if they used a little bit more, but later, after calculating a few tricks, they could save more than 40,000 yuan throughout the year. As an engineer in the factory said: Small savings are not easy to see, but the numbers become large when they are put together.
    Savings must ensure product quality. This point has been repeatedly emphasized in the Shandong Paper Mill in the process of saving, and the facts have also proved that the two are consistent. The Second Paper-making Workshop only needs to increase the first-class products of cigarette paper by 3 percent, and it can save more than 18,300 yuan for the country throughout the year. The quantitative tolerance of cigarette paper is no more than 2.7 kilograms per roll. However, in the past, the paper surface was not good, and the workers were afraid of producing defective products, so they deliberately made it thicker, and the quantitative tolerance reached more than 3 kilograms. The Shandong Paper Mill wasted more than 4,300 yuan for this reason in the first quarter. Due to the uneven thickness of the paper, the quality of cigarettes was also affected. This time, everyone conducted a serious study and improved the operation, which resulted in a reduction in pulp consumption and also improved the quality of the paper. In order to ensure quality, the workers will install the embossing machine that has been idle for a long time; the repair workers are designing and manufacturing a screening machine that has never been manufactured before. The Shandong Paper Mill recently took the initiative to have discussions with relevant personnel from the commercial department to listen to users' opinions and further improve quality in order to expand sales.
    Now, all the employees of the Shandong Paper Mill are focusing on the realization of savings plans and quotas, deliberating on signing collective contracts and contact contracts, vigorously improving the work of departments, promoting economic accounting in work groups, and strengthening the analysis of economic activities, so as to discover advanced factors and overcome backward phenomena in a timely manner. They are full of confidence in carrying out the savings work normally and persistently.

### 山东造纸总厂修订节约计划

　　山东造纸总厂修订节约计划
　　陈华鲁
    山东造纸总厂节约成本的计划修改了好几次，第一次是十七万五千多元，第二次是三十四万九千多元，第三次是五十五万四千元。厂长还满有把握地说：现在又要超过了。
    今年三月底，山东造纸总厂接到轻工业部关于节约的指示后，领导人员和管理人员就进行酝酿。当时大家认为今年的计划比任何一年都订得先进，成本比去年计划降低了将近百分之十一点五，第一季度完成计划的情况也不坏，废鱼网、绳头，也当做原料做成好纸了，浪费虽然有，但“老厂问题不大”。因此，计划科同有关部门一合计，就把计划订好了。
    四月，轻工业部召开全国厂长会议。山东造纸总厂的厂长在会上听到部的领导同志反复强调：必须向前看。他再听听兄弟厂的汇报，认为别厂进步很快。譬如单位用浆量，上海的纸厂每吨卷烟纸仅用浆八百二十多公斤，安徽的纸厂也只用八百五十多公斤，而自己厂里却用九百多公斤；有光纸的用浆量，有的厂只用九百多公斤，自己厂里却用一千零四、五十公斤。相形之下，显得落后了。厂长又研究一下生产情况。他发现第一季度成本计划虽超额完成了百分之三点八八，节约七万多元，但比去年第四季度的实际成本却提高了零点二九，在一百三十七项定额中，就有五十三项没有完成。如果把落后的因素消灭掉，那就会比现在增加许多收入。厂长回厂以后，把这些情况跟大家一讲，许多人才感到过去骄傲自满和保守思想太严重了，要求修订计划。
    有些人在口头上理论上拥护重点建设，赞成为社会主义工业化多积累资金，但是却不愿把计划订得先进些。山东造纸总厂在修改计划和定额的过程中，便遇到这种人。例如，葵麻的实际收获率平均是百分之五十九点二六，其中一月份曾达到百分之六十三点九。但是负责订计划的人只把收获率订为百分之五十九，他们的理由是：现在麻不好，收获率低了。这是事实，但如何努力改善麻的供应和加工，以提高收获率呢？他们就不考虑了。工人讨论时，才改为百分之六十。废鱼收获率，第一季度实际已达到百分之四十三点一二，但订计划的人只订为百分之四十三，他们的理由是买的网子越来越差。对使用代用品，订计划的人认为不能多用，理由是绳头、鱼网等代用品不容易买。但是，经过厂的领导人员的批判和帮助分析，他们才认识到可以多买多用代用品，并决定第四季度全部用代用品造烟纸，这一项就可节约十九万多元，还可以把省下的好麻用到国家最需要的地方去。
    领导人员必须从全面分析中，抓住节约重点和关键，发动群众突破它，这是很重要的。但是，小的普遍存在的点滴浪费也不可忽视。山东造纸总厂的领导人员原来对这点是认识不够的，认为一星半点的浪费算不了什么。直到后来全面审查计划和帮助车间算账、制定措施计划时，他们才开始注意小的浪费，也抓小的节约。这一注意就发现了巨大潜力。三抄成车间稍一合计，起码还可再节约一万五千多元。厂部没规定制浆车间的节约指标，职工们自动提出节约一万三千多元。厂部给二抄成车间的节约指标是二十四万四千多元，这个车间注意了小的节约后，又增加了五万七千多元。加油的工人们，只在加油时“勤加、少加、防止扑嗤一倒”，每月用的机油就由一百五十斤减到五十斤。抄纸工段的工人们，原来认为造纸总厂“树大荫凉大”，多用一星半点没什么，但后来把几个窍门一合算，全年就可节约四万多元。正如厂里一位工程师所说的：小的节约虽不容易看见，但集合起来数字就大了。
    节约必须保证产品质量。这一点，山东造纸总厂在节约中是反复强调的，事实也证明，两者是一致的。二抄成车间，只把卷烟纸的一等品提高百分之三，全年就可为国家多节约一万八千三百元。卷烟纸的定量公差，是每盘纸不超过二点七公斤。但过去纸面不好，职工们怕出废品，便故意做得厚点，定量公差达三公斤多。山东造纸总厂第一季度为此浪费了四千三百多元。因纸厚薄不匀，卷烟的质量也受到影响。这次大家认真进行了研究，改进操作，结果降低了用浆量，也提高了纸的质量。为了保证质量，工人们将把闲置好久的压纹机安装起来；修理工人们正在设计和制造从来没有制造过的筛浆机。山东造纸总厂最近曾主动同商业部门有关人员座谈，听取用户的意见，进一步改善质量，以便扩大销路。
    现在，山东造纸总厂全体职工正围绕实现节约计划和定额，酝酿签订集体合同、联系合同，大力改进科室工作，推广班组经济核算，加强经济活动分析，以便及时地发现先进因素，克服落后现象。他们满怀信心地要把节约工作正常地坚持下去。
