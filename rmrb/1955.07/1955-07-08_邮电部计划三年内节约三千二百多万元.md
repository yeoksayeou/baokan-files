The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently formulated a preliminary plan to save over 32 million yuan from 1955 to 1957. The cost-saving measures stipulate that long-distance telecommunications construction and technical upgrades of telecommunications equipment must be carried out with a focus on key areas. The principle for urban telephone construction should prioritize major cities that are national key construction political, economic, and industrial centers, as well as newly built industrial areas with fixed urban planning and basically formed factory buildings, neighborhoods, and roads.

The cost-saving plan proposes different cost reduction requirements for various construction projects that have already started and those that have not yet started. For long-distance telecommunications line construction in 1955, construction management costs should be reduced as much as possible. While ensuring quality, efforts should be made to reduce construction costs even below the original target of 4 percent. For equipment room buildings that have not yet started construction, efforts should be made to reduce costs by 10 percent; for general building construction, costs should be reduced by 10 percent for projects that have already started, and by 15 percent for projects that have not yet started; all projects that are in the design phase or have not yet started design should be designed in accordance with the standards stipulated by the central government.

The cost-saving plan determines that for capital construction projects in 1956 and 1957, the cost of public service buildings will be reduced by 7 percent; civil buildings will be designed according to cost standards, reducing costs by 38.9 percent from the original budget, saving a total of 10.93 million yuan.

The cost-saving plan stipulates that measures to reduce production costs include strengthening supervision and inspection, eliminating corruption and theft, streamlining management organizations, strengthening equipment management, and reducing transportation costs. After these measures are implemented, production costs can be reduced by over 17 million yuan from 1955 to 1957.

　　邮电部计划三年内节约三千二百多万元
    新华社六日讯　邮电部最近初步订出了从一九五五年到一九五七年节约三千二百多万元的计划。节约措施规定，长途电信建设和电信设备的技术改造，必须有重点地进行；市内电话建设的原则，应该是以国家重点建设的政治经济工业中心的大城市，和城市规划已定，厂房、街坊、马路已经基本形成的新建工业区域作为重点。
    节约计划中对已经开工的和还没有开工的各项建设工程，分别不同性质提出降低造价的要求。一九五五年长途电信线路建设应尽量降低施工管理费用，在保证质量的原则下，争取降低造价比原定百分之四的指标还要少。还没有开工的机房建筑，争取降低造价百分之十；一般房屋建筑，已经开工的要求降低造价百分之十，还没有开工的要求降低造价百分之十五；开始进行设计或还没有进行设计的，一律遵照中央规定的标准进行设计。
    节约计划确定，一九五六年和一九五七年的基本建设工程，事业建筑降低造价百分之七；民用建筑根据造价标准进行设计，按原预算降低造价百分之三十八点九；共可节约一千零九十三万元。
    节约计划中规定减少生产费用的措施是加强监督检查，肃清贪污盗窃，精简管理机构，加强器材管理，降低运输成本。这些措施执行以后，一九五五年到一九五七年就可以节约生产费用一千七百多万元。
