    Some Questions Concerning Poor Peasants' Cooperative Fund Loans

    Q: Why is it necessary to provide poor peasants' cooperative fund loans?

    A: The state provides poor peasants' cooperative fund loans in order to help poor peasants solve the difficulty of paying the fees to join agricultural production cooperatives, thereby consolidating the unity of poor and middle peasants, implementing the principle of mutual benefit, and inspiring and encouraging middle peasants to actively invest in the cooperatives, so as to further promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, providing poor peasants' cooperative fund loans is an important measure for the state to help poor peasants participate in agricultural production cooperatives in terms of material support.

    Q: Who are the recipients of poor peasants' cooperative fund loans?

    A: The recipients of poor peasants' cooperative fund loans are mainly poor peasants participating in agricultural production cooperatives, as well as individual new middle peasants who still lack production funds. Since the land reform period, poor peasants have actively developed production with the help of the state in recent years, and a large part of them have risen to become new middle peasants. Therefore, they already have the ability to bear the cost of joining the cooperatives. Therefore, when determining the loan recipients, the existing class composition, economic conditions, and degree of difficulty should be the main basis, while also referring to the original class composition during the land reform period.

    Although individual poor peasants are not the recipients of agricultural cooperative fund loans, the Party and the government are also very concerned about them. If impoverished peasants who have not participated in agricultural production cooperatives have difficulties in production or life, they can obtain loans from general agricultural loan programs.

    Q: What should poor peasants' cooperative fund loans be used for?

    A: The state provides this loan specifically to help poor peasants participating in agricultural production cooperatives solve the difficulty of paying the fees to join the cooperatives. Generally, there are two items for the cost of joining an agricultural production cooperative for its members: one is the apportioned price of the current year's production expenses, that is, the production base share fund (such as fertilizer, seeds, livestock feed, sideline production expenses, and membership fees) that each household should share; the other is the apportioned price of the main means of production (such as livestock, large farm tools, vehicles, boats, etc.) that have been valued and returned to the agricultural cooperative. Poor peasants' cooperative fund loans can only be used for these two membership fees. As for the individual living difficulties of poor peasant members, if agricultural production cooperatives need assistance in expanding basic construction and temporary capital turnover, it should be resolved through other agricultural loan programs.

    Q: How much can each poor peasant household borrow?

    A: The principle for determining the amount of loan for each household is: lend more to those who lack more, lend less to those who lack less, and lend nothing to those who lack nothing. That is to say: for the apportioned membership fees, each poor peasant member should first try to take out their own funds as much as possible, and if their own funds are insufficient, the state will provide loans. In short, the amount of the loan should be based on the actual needs of the poor peasant members. If the loan is too small, it will not solve the actual difficulties of poor peasants when joining the cooperatives, and at the same time, it will prevent the loan from playing a role in promoting the development of the cooperative movement, which is not right. However, if we blindly lend too much, it will also encourage agricultural production cooperatives to depreciate and return the main means of production to the cooperatives too much and too quickly, increasing the burden on poor peasant members, affecting the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, and at the same time wasting the state's agricultural loan funds.

    Q: What is the loan term and interest rate?

    A: Since poor peasants need a certain amount of time to gradually increase their income based on the development of production after joining agricultural production cooperatives, the repayment period for poor peasants' cooperative fund loans is very long, generally five years, starting from the end of the second production year (that is, the third year), and repaid within the fifth year. For individual loan households with special difficulties, the repayment period can also be appropriately extended according to the actual situation. If some loan households have better economic conditions and are willing to repay early (such as within two, three, or four years), it is of course welcome. In this way, the state's agricultural loans can help other farmers in need.

    The loan interest rate is very low, only 4 per mille per month, which is a special preferential treatment by the state for poor peasant members.

    Q: What procedures are required to apply for a loan?

    A: Poor peasant members can apply for poor peasants' cooperative fund loans to the agricultural production cooperative. After discussion and evaluation by other members within the cooperative, the cooperative will summarize and submit the application uniformly to the local bank. Under the leadership of the local Party and government, the bank will convene district and township staff and cooperative staff to discuss and review the application in batches. After approval, the members will sign a contract with the bank, and the agricultural production cooperative will uniformly handle the loan procedures. This loan will be used uniformly by the cooperative. When the loan is due, the members will repay the loan individually, and the agricultural production cooperative will uniformly handle the repayment procedures with the bank. Since not all agricultural production cooperatives use loans at one time, in order to use state agricultural loans rationally, the loan can be approved at one time and issued in installments according to the actual time of need under the contract.

    有关贫农合作基金贷款的一些问题
    问：为什么要举办贫农合作基金贷款？
    答：国家举办贫农合作基金贷款，是为了帮助贫农解决加入农业生产合作社入社费用的困难，从而巩固贫农和中农的团结，贯彻双方互利原则，启发和鼓励中农积极向社内投资，以便于进一步促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。因此，举办贫农合作基金贷款，是国家在物质上帮助贫农参加农业生产合作社的一项重要措施。
    问：贫农合作基金贷款的对象是谁？
    答：贫农合作基金贷款的对象主要是参加农业生产合作社的贫农，以及个别生产资金仍然很缺少的新中农。由于土地改革时期的贫农，几年来在国家帮助下积极发展生产，他们已有很大一部分上升为新中农，因之，他们已有能力负担入社费用。所以在确定贷款对象时，应以现有的阶级成份、经济条件和困难程度作主要根据，同时参照土地改革时期原来的阶级成份。
    个体贫农虽然不是农业合作基金贷款的对象，但是，党和政府对他们也是很关怀的。没有参加农业生产合作社的贫困农民在生产上、生活上如果有困难，可以在一般农贷项目中贷款给他。
    问：贫农合作基金贷款应该用在什么地方？
    答：国家举办这项贷款，是专门为了帮助参加农业生产合作社的贫农解决入社费用的困难。农业生产合作社社员的入社费用一般有两项：一项是应缴纳的当年生产费用平摊价格，也就是每户应摊的生产底垫股份基金（如肥料、种籽、牲畜饲料、副业生产费用和入社费等）；另一项是已经作价归农业社的主要生产资料（例如牲畜、大农具、车、船等）每户应平摊的价款。贫农合作基金贷款只能用于这两项入社费用。至于贫农社员个人在生活上如果还有困难，农业生产合作社在扩大基本建设和临时资金周转方面如果还需要帮助，应该在其他农业贷款项目中另行解决。
    问：每户贫农可以贷多少款？
    答：确定每户贷款数量的原则是：多缺的多贷，少缺的少贷，不缺的不贷。这就是说：对于应摊的入社费用，每户贫农社员先要尽量拿出自有的资金，如果自有资金不足，再由国家贷款。总之，贷款数量要根据贫农社员的实际需要。如果贷款过少，不能解决贫农入社时的实际困难，同时也使贷款不能起促进合作化运动发展的作用，这是不对的。不过，如果盲目多贷款，也会助长农业生产合作社将主要生产资料过多、过快地折价归社，使贫农社员负担过重，影响农业生产合作社的巩固，同时也会浪费国家的农贷资金。
    问：贷款的期限多长？利息是多少？
    答：由于贫农参加农业生产合作社后需要一定的时间才能在发展生产的基础上逐年增加收入，因此贫农合作基金贷款的偿还期限订得很长，一般的是五年，从第二个生产年度结束以后（就是第三年）开始偿还，在第五个年度内还清。对于个别有特殊困难的贷款农户，还可以根据实际情况酌量延长归还期限。如果有的贷款农户经济条件较好，愿意提前还清（如在两年、三年或四年内还清），当然也是值得欢迎的。这样，就可以使国家的农贷能够帮助别的有困难的农民。
    贷款利息很低，只收月息四厘，这是国家对贫农社员的一种特殊优待。
    问：申请贷款需要什么手续？
    答：贫农社员申请贫农合作基金贷款，可以向农业生产合作社提出，经过社内其他社员讨论评议，由社汇总统一送交当地银行。银行在当地党政领导下，召集区、乡工作人员和办社工作人员分批讨论，审查批准。批准以后，社员向银行立约，由农业生产合作社统一承办借款手续。这项贷款交社统一使用。贷款到期的时候，由社员个人归还贷款，农业生产合作社统一向银行办理归还手续。由于有的农业生产合作社并不都是一次使用贷款的，为了合理使用国家农贷起见，贷款可以一次批准，按实际需要的时间，分期订立契约发放。
