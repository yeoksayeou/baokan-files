    Expansion work on the Mengjin Reservoir in Xinjiang Province commenced on June 17th. This reservoir is located in Wujiaqu, 55 kilometers north of Urumqi. After the Urumqi River flows out of the Tianshan Mountains, a large amount of river water seeps into the ground. In the downstream area, spring water emerges from the ground, and the reservoir mainly collects and stores this spring water. In 1952, a unit of the People's Liberation Army built this reservoir, which only stored 3 million cubic meters of water. After the current expansion is completed, it will be able to store 60 million cubic meters of water and irrigate 260,000 mu of farmland. The entire project will be completed by mid-November of this year.

　  新疆猛进水库扩建工程开工
    新疆省猛进水库于六月十七日动工扩建。这座水库在乌鲁木齐市以北五十五公里的五家渠，乌鲁木齐河从天山流出后，大量河水，渗漏到地下，到了下游，泉水又涌出地面，水库主要引蓄这些泉水。一九五二年，人民解放军某部曾修建这座水库，只蓄水三百万立方公尺，这次扩建竣工后，可蓄水六千万立方公尺，灌溉农田二十六万亩。全部工程将在今年十一月中旬完成。
