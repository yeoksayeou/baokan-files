Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 14th: The Argentine Perón government announced on the 11th that it would try the leaders of the anti-government riots of the 9th and 10th, who had been arrested, for crimes endangering national security. As previously reported, after the failure of the U.S.-backed armed coup against the Perón government on June 16th, riots incited by the Catholic Church occurred again in Buenos Aires on July 9th and 10th. These riots were suppressed by government police at the time.

The Argentine Minister of the Army, Lucero, delivered a radio address on the 11th, stating that the army would continue to be loyal to Perón.

Signs indicate that the Catholic Church is brewing new actions. Influential Catholic figures announced on the 13th the establishment of an initiating committee to organize the Catholic Democratic Party, and openly expressed their hostility towards the Perón government. An Associated Press report said that the Catholic Church is attempting to oppose the Perón regime by organizing such a political party.

It was precisely the day before the establishment of the Catholic Democratic Party initiating committee that more than eighty Catholics from the United States arrived in Argentina for a "visit."

    阿根廷政府将以危害国家罪审讯骚动头目
    新华社十四日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷庇隆政府在十一日宣布，它将以危害国家安全罪审判被逮捕的九日和十日反政府骚乱的领导者。前已报道，在六月十六日美国幕后策动的反对庇隆政府的武装政变失败后，七月九日和十日又在布宜诺斯艾利斯发生过天主教教会煽动的骚乱，这次骚乱当时就被政府警察镇压下去。
    庇隆政府的陆军部长卢塞罗在十一日发表广播演说，表示陆军将继续效忠庇隆。
    迹象表明，天主教教会方面正在酝酿着新的行动。有势力的天主教人士已在十三日宣布成立组织天主教民主党的发起委员会，并且公开表示他们敌视庇隆政府。美联社消息说，天主教教会是企图靠组织这样一个政党来反对庇隆政权。
    正是在天主教民主党发起委员会成立的前一天，美国有八十多名天主教人士到达阿根廷进行“访问”。
