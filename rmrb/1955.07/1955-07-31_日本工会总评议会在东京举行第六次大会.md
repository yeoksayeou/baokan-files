Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 30th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") held its sixth congress in Tokyo from the 26th to the 29th. More than three million "Sohyo" members elected more than two hundred representatives to attend the congress.

The congress was held under the slogan of "Unifying the Labor Front." The congress received congratulations from left-wing political parties and international and domestic trade union organizations.

Takano Minoru, Secretary-General of "Sohyo," reported on the situation of the Japanese labor movement in the past year at the congress on the 26th. He pointed out that the struggles led by "Sohyo" in the past year have expanded and intensified, especially the nearly 200-day anti-layoff strike by workers at the Muroran factory of Japan Steel Works, which greatly alarmed the capitalists. Takano Minoru said that in the past year, "Sohyo's" organization has expanded, and the Japanese labor movement has advanced. At the same time, international ties have also been strengthened. The congress, after heated discussion, approved this report.

The congress discussed and adopted the future direction of "Sohyo's" movement, which included: opposing participation in the so-called "Productivity Headquarters" in the name of increasing production, carrying out struggles to demand higher wages, unifying the domestic labor front, and strengthening cooperation with trade unions in Asian and African countries. "Sohyo" also advocated promoting cooperation between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party and fighting against the Hatoyama Cabinet.

In a declaration passed on the last day of the congress, it was stated that Japan is groaning under the clutches of domestic and foreign monopoly capital that is attempting to subordinate Japan to the United States and to launch an atomic war. Under the slogan of "increasing productivity," the masses of people are in a state of poverty characterized by unemployment and hardship. The declaration stated that "Sohyo" has united with people from all walks of life to fight against domestic and foreign monopoly capital. Now, the working class must stand at the forefront of the people and actively fight for peace and independence, and for improving living standards.

At the final day of the conference, Fujita Tohtaro was re-elected as the chairman of "Sohyo," and Ohta Kaoru, Imamura Akira, and Shioji Nobuo were elected as vice-chairmen of "Sohyo." Takano Minoru and Iwai Akira, head of the planning department of the National Railway Workers' Union, competed for the position of Secretary-General of "Sohyo." As a result of the first ballot, neither candidate obtained a majority of the votes. Before the second ballot, Takano Minoru announced his withdrawal from the candidacy, and therefore Iwai Akira was confirmed as the Secretary-General of "Sohyo," while Takano Minoru was reassigned as a permanent director. Before the "Sohyo" congress was held, news had spread that right-wing elements had long planned to use the election to split "Sohyo," which unites half of all organized workers in Japan. After being elected, Iwai Akira said that he was willing to do his best to achieve the goal of unifying the labor front.

While "Sohyo" held its congress, the right-wing All-Japan Trade Union Congress also held its second congress on the 26th and 27th. The congress did not make a positive resolution on the issue of unifying the labor front, and rejected the proposal to include supporting the peaceful constitution and opposing rearmament in the trade union movement's policy.

    日本工会总评议会在东京举行第六次大会
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）从二十六日到二十九日在东京举行了第六次大会。三百多万名“总评”会员推选出二百多名代表出席了大会。
    大会是在“统一劳动战线”的口号下举行的。大会受到了左翼政党、国际和国内工会团体的祝贺。
    “总评”事务局局长高野实二十六日在大会上报告了一年来日本劳工运动的情况。他指出，“总评”在这一年里领导的斗争在扩大和高涨，特别是日本制钢所室兰工厂工人的坚持了将近两百天的反解雇罢工，使资本家大为惊骇。高野实说，一年来，“总评”的组织扩大了，日本的工人运动前进了。同时，国际联系也加强了。大会经过热烈的讨论，批准了这个报告。
    大会讨论和通过了“总评”今后运动的方针，其中包括：反对参加以增加生产为名的所谓“生产力本部”，进行要求提高工资的斗争，统一国内劳工战线，加强同亚非各国工会的合作。“总评”也主张促进左、右两派社会党的合作和同鸠山内阁进行斗争。
    大会在最后一天的会议中通过一项宣言说，日本正呻吟在企图使日本隶属美国和企图发动原子战争的国内外垄断资本的魔掌之下。在“提高生产力”的口号下，人民群众正处于失业和生活困苦的贫穷状况之中。宣言声明，“总评”曾经同各阶层人民团结一起，对国内外垄断资本进行了斗争。现在，工人阶级要站在人民的前列积极地为争取和平和独立、为提高生活水平而斗争。
    大会最后再次选举藤田藤太郎为“总评”主席，选出太田薰、今村彰、盐谷信雄为“总评”副主席。高野实和国营铁道工会企划部部长岩井章竞选“总评”事务局局长的职位。第一次投票的结果，两个候选人都未能获得过半数票。在第二次投票前，高野实宣布放弃候选人资格，因此确定由岩井章担任“总评”事务局局长，高野实改任常任干事。在这次“总评”大会举行前就有消息传出，右翼分子早就策划要通过竞选来使团结着日本全部有组织的工人的一半的“总评”分裂。岩井章在当选后表示，他愿全力达成统一劳工战线的目标。
    在“总评”举行大会的同时，右翼的全日本工会会议也在二十六日和二十七日举行了第二次大会。大会没有对统一劳工战线问题作出积极的决议，并且否决了把拥护和平宪法和反对重整军备两项列入工会运动方针的主张。
