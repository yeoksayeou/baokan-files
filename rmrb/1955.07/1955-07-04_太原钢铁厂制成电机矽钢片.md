　　Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Manufactures Electrical Silicon Steel Sheets
    The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has successfully trial-produced electrical silicon steel sheets. After magnetic testing and user trials, the quality has been proven to fully meet technical requirements, with a qualification rate of over 70%.
    Electrical silicon steel sheets are the material used to manufacture motor cores. Before the invention of electrical silicon steel sheets, motor cores were made of soft iron, and such motors could only achieve 60% efficiency. After using electrical silicon steel sheets to manufacture the core, the motor's efficiency can reach 80% to 95%.
    Previously, China's silicon steel sheets were entirely imported from abroad, with each ton costing more than 2,000 yuan. Now that the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has successfully trial-produced silicon steel sheets, it can gradually supply the needs of China's motor industry, saving the country a lot of foreign exchange every year.

　　太原钢铁厂制成电机矽钢片
    电机矽钢片已在太原钢铁厂试制成功。经过磁性检验和用户试用，证明质量完全合乎技术要求，合格率达百分之七十以上。
    电机矽钢片是制造电机铁心的材料。在没有发明电机矽钢片以前，电机铁心都是用软铁制造的，这种电机仅能发挥百分之六十的效率；改用电机矽钢片制造铁心以后，电机的效率能达到百分之八十到九十五。
    我国以前使用的矽钢片完全由外国进口，每吨矽钢片的价格需要两千多元。现在，太原钢铁厂试制矽钢片成功后，可逐步供应我国电机工业的需要，每年并可给国家节省很多外汇。（丁继盛）
