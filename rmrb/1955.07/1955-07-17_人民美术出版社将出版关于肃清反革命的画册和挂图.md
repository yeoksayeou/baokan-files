The People's Fine Arts Publishing House, to coordinate with the struggle to purge the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, will soon publish several albums, slides, wall charts, and propaganda posters.

The album "Collection of Cartoons on Resolutely Purging the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements" collects fifty-one cartoons that have been published in newspapers and magazines across the country. The slide show "Resolutely Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements" is a series of continuous cartoons. These cartoons expose the nature of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and its double-dealing tactics, point out the harm caused to revolutionary work by liberalism and a lack of vigilance, and call on people to smash all hidden enemies. This slide show will also be printed as a comic book album. In addition, propaganda posters and color-printed wall charts on this subject will also be published.
