Nanfen Mining General Plant Emphasizes Saving Manpower
　　Yu Song
　　When the Nanfen Mining General Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in Liaoning Province was newly established in April of last year, the most troublesome issue for the leaders was: the labor productivity of Nanfen Mining had improved very little in recent years, and the mining workshop only completed 94.3 percent of the national plan in 1953. Accompanying this situation was the very small reduction in production costs. This meant that national funds were being wasted, and the enterprise's management level was not high.
　　The biggest obstacle to improving labor productivity was too many personnel. There were so many personnel that the number of auxiliary workers exceeded the number of basic workers, and the number of technical personnel and clerks was almost half the number of basic workers.
　　No matter which section of the General Plant's office you went to, you could see many people with nothing to do. There were more than thirty statistical personnel in the open-pit mine, and some people only compiled one or two reports a month. The General Plant's capital construction finance section had a clerk whose entire daily workload was filling out one report, which could be completed in just six minutes, and the rest of the time was spent studying culture and doing algebra. There were also many people who wrote limericks and chatted idly to kill time, and labor discipline in the office was very lax.
　　The situation was the same in the office, and the phenomenon of idleness at the site was also very serious. Some classes of workers only needed four or five hours to complete eight hours of work, and the remaining time was spent "in meetings." There were too many auxiliary workers, and they ran to the duty director every day to ask for work, but the duty director had no solution. Therefore, sometimes when the site needed two repair workers, the duty director would generously say: "I'll give you six!"
　　Comrades with nothing to do said that this situation was really uncomfortable, and they all asked the leaders of their units to give them work to do, but the leaders had no good work to assign, so they had to comfort them by saying, "The future of Nanfen Mining's development is bright, study hard, and you will be needed in the future."
　　The development prospects of Nanfen Mining are indeed bright, and a large amount of manpower will indeed be needed in the future, but it is the greatest waste to leave personnel idle in various departments at present. After the General Plant's Party Committee carefully studied these situations, it mobilized the employees in all its departments to carefully calculate the workload of their units; at the same time, it also investigated how many people were redundant in each unit. Then, the General Plant's Party Committee referred to the Soviet mining quota standards, determined the General Plant's staffing quota, and decided to carry out the work of reorganizing the organization in stages and in several times.
　　From August of last year to now, under the leadership of the General Plant's Party Committee, a total of three large-scale organizational reorganization efforts have been carried out. The first time was in August of last year, and the latter two times were carried out at the end of last year and in April of this year. They were all mobilized and deployed from top to bottom by the leaders according to the overall plan, and the staffing quotas were distributed to the masses for discussion, thus receiving the effect of combining top and bottom and giving play to the experience and wisdom of the masses.
　　After the reorganization, in addition to improving labor organization and eliminating the phenomenon of idleness in the production department, the main focus was on promoting advanced experience and holding small-scale mechanization, which improved work efficiency and saved manpower. For example, after the plant promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "hard alloy drill bit" in the open-pit mine, the drilling efficiency increased by 48 percent. Previously, three people operated one drilling machine, but now three people can operate two, and many auxiliary workers such as those making drill bits can be saved. Due to the promotion of this advanced experience, a total of 152 workers were saved. Another example is that after the ore dressing workshop implemented mechanized ore crushing and feeding, dozens of workers were saved, and the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced. Other examples include the promotion of the advanced experience of the "wind leg rock drill" in the open-pit mine, the implementation of small-scale mechanization of "electric shovel ore extraction," and the adoption of the workers' rationalization proposal of "one person operating two grinding machines" (previously one person per machine) in the ore dressing workshop, which all improved labor efficiency and saved manpower.
　　In the management organs, the main way to save manpower is by reducing levels, improving working methods, and streamlining reports. For example, the plant merged the original mining workshop and open-pit construction site into the open-pit iron mine, saving more than 100 management personnel; after the section-level levels below the division were abolished, more than 80 section chiefs in the plant who were partially detached from production participated in practical work. In various business sections, many advanced working methods were promoted, such as the "journal voucher system" in the accounting department and the "quota material issuance and delivery system" in the materials department, which reduced many unnecessary procedures and saved a lot of manpower. Taking the "quota material issuance system" as an example, in the past, workers in the open-pit mine needed to go through four procedures and stand in line three times to receive materials, but now they only need to get the foreman's approval and take the quota material issuance book to receive the materials. Due to the simplification of procedures, the number of material issuance personnel was reduced from ten to three. In addition, many statistical personnel were saved by streamlining internal reports. For example, the open-pit mine used to report more than 90 kinds of reports every month, an average of more than 120 copies per day, and more than 30 people were dedicated to making these reports; after the reorganization, more than 60 kinds of reports were cancelled, and the number of copies was reduced by more than 90 percent. Now, it only takes one person to make these reports.
　　In streamlining the organization, the Party Committee strengthened political and ideological leadership. When the staffing quota standards were issued, many middle-level leaders and division leaders had ideological concerns. Some said: "If we reduce so many people, what should we do if we can't complete the task?" Some said: "The level of our staff is much lower than that of the Soviet comrades, and the staffing quota is similar to that of the Soviet Union, so how can it work?" The method of solving these ideological problems is, on the one hand, the General Plant's office and the Party and mass organizations play a leading role. The General Plant's office resolutely abides by the staffing quota standards, and the Party and mass organizations also streamline a large number of people (for example, the open-pit mine used to have more than 50 full-time cadres, but after the streamlining, there are only 28). On the other hand, the Party Committee and the General Branches mobilize the masses to help the leaders relieve their concerns. If the division chief has concerns, the division chief and the staff members are brought together to study how much work there is in the division, how much potential has not been tapped in the past, how many people are needed at most, and how to divide the work. Because the masses enthusiastically supported the work of reorganizing the organization and took the initiative to demand an increase in their workload, after the masses discussed, the staffing quotas all reached the General Plant's targets, and the staffing quotas of many divisions such as the accounting, technical supply, and labor organization divisions of the open-pit mine were even lower than the General Plant's targets.
　　After these reorganizations, a new atmosphere has emerged in the Nanfen Mining General Plant. On average, one out of every three employees in the plant has been removed. In terms of proportion, the most employees were removed from the ranks of clerks, accounting for 56.6 percent of the total number of clerks. After a large number of personnel were removed, the monthly wage expenditure was more than 110,000 yuan less than last year, and the production cost could be reduced by 6.7 percent compared with the actual cost last year. The proportion of employees has also become more reasonable, with basic workers accounting for more than 60 percent, and technical personnel and clerks accounting for only about 10 percent of the total number of employees. This has enabled labor productivity to be rapidly improved. The value created by each employee in March last year was 231 yuan, and it has reached 335 yuan in April this year, an increase of 45 percent. Most of the people who were removed were transferred to the General Plant's new factories and mines and are studying culture or technology; some were used to support factories and mines in other places or within Benxi Iron and Steel Company; and some were producing bricks, tiles, sand and gravel for the needs of capital construction in the plant. In short, all have been properly arranged and are actively working and studying in new positions.

　　南芬矿山总厂重视节约人力
　　雨松
    去年四月，辽宁省本溪钢铁公司南芬矿山总厂新成立时，使领导者最感头痛的是：几年来南芬矿山的劳动生产率提高得很少，矿山车间一九五三年只完成国家计划百分之九十四点三。随着这种情况而产生的是生产成本降低得很少。这就意味着国家资金被浪费，企业的管理水平不高。
    阻碍劳动生产率提高的最大原因是人员太多。人员竟多到这样的程度：辅助工人多于基本工人，技术人员和职员差不多等于基本工人的一半。
    不论到总厂机关的哪一个科，都能看到很多人没有工作做。露天矿有三十多个统计人员，有的人一个月只统计一两种表报。总厂基本建设财务科有一个职员，每天的全部工作量是填一张表报，只要六分钟就能做完，其余时间就学文化、算代数。还有很多人为了消磨时间，作打油诗、闲扯，机关中的劳动纪律很松弛。
    机关是这样，现场的窝工现象也很严重。有的全班工人只要四、五个钟头就做完了八小时的活，余下时间就“开会”。辅助工人太多了，每天跑到值班主任处要求工作，值班主任也没有办法。因此，有的时候现场要两个检修工人，值班主任却慷慨地说：“给你六名！”
    没有活干的同志都说，这种情况真难受，都要求本单位的领导者给他工作做，而领导者也没有工作好分配，只好以“南芬矿山发展的前途远大，好好学习，将来需要”来安慰他。
    南芬矿山的发展前途的确是远大，将来确实需要大批人力，但在目前把人员闲置在各部门中，这却是最大的浪费。当总厂党委细致地研究了这些情况后，便动员所属各部门的职工群众，把本单位的工作量算了一下细账；同时还调查了一下各单位究竟多了多少人。接着，总厂党委便参照苏联矿山的定员标准，确定了总厂的人员定额，决定分几次逐步地进行整编机构的工作。
    从去年八月到现在，在总厂党委的领导下，一共进行了三次较大规模的整编机构的工作。第一次是去年八月份开始的，后两次是在去年年底和今年四月间进行的，都是由领导上按照总的计划从上到下地动员、布置，把定员定额发给群众讨论，因而收到了上下结合、发挥群众的经验和智慧的作用。
    经过整编以后，在生产部门除改善了劳动组织、消灭了窝工现象以外，主要是推广先进经验和举办小型机械化，提高了工作效率，节省了人力。比如该厂在露天矿推广苏联“硬质合金钎子头”的先进经验后，打眼效率提高了百分之四十八，以前三人操纵一台打眼机，现在三人可以操纵二台，并可以节省制钎等很多辅助工人。由于推广这一先进经验，共节省了工人一百五十二人。又如选矿车间实行机械化碎矿、给矿以后，节省了几十名工人，并且大大地降低了工人的劳动强度。其他如在露天矿推行“风腿子顶凿岩机”的先进经验，实行“电扒出矿”的小型机械化，在选矿车间采纳工人“一人操纵两台磨矿机”（以前一人一台）的合理化建议等，都提高了劳动效率，节省了人力。
    在管理机关中，主要是通过减少层次、改进工作方法，精简表报来节省人力的。如该厂把原矿山车间和露天工地合并为露天铁矿，节省了一百多名管理人员；把科下面的股级层次取消以后，使全厂八十多个股的半脱离生产的股长参加了实际工作。在各业务科内，推行了很多先进的工作方法，如会计部门的“日记账凭单制”，材料部门的“限额发料、送料制”等，都减少了很多不必要的手续，节省了很多人力。以“限额发料制”为例，过去露天矿的工人领一次材料需要办四次手续，站三次队，现在只要经过工长批准，拿了限额发料折就可以领到材料，由于简化手续，发料人员由十人减少为三人。另外，通过精简内部表报，还节省了很多统计人员。如露天矿以前每月要报九十多种表报，平均每天要报一百二十多份，有三十多人专门造这些表报；整编以后，取消了六十多种表报，份数减少了百分之九十多，现在，造这些表报只要一个人就行了。
    在精简机构时，党委加强了政治思想领导。当定员标准发下去以后，很多中层领导同志和科的领导同志思想上都有顾虑，有的说：“要减这许多人，完不成任务怎么办？”有的说：“我们的工作人员的水平比苏联同志低得多，定员和苏联差不多，那怎么能行？”解决这些思想问题的方法，一方面是由总厂机关和党群机关起带头作用，总厂机关坚决遵守定员标准，党群机关也大量精简（如露天矿以前有专职干部五十多名，精简后只有二十八名）。另一方面，是党委和各总支发动群众来帮助领导上解除顾虑。科长有顾虑的，就把科长和科员一块找来，研究到底科内有多少工作，过去有多少潜力没有发挥，最多需要多少人，怎样分工。由于群众热烈地拥护整编机构的工作，主动地要求增加自己的工作量，所以经过群众讨论后，定员都达到了总厂的指标，很多科室如露天矿的会计、技术供应、劳动组织等科的定员，都比总厂的指标还少。
    经过这几次整编以后，南芬矿山总厂已经出现了新气象。全厂职工平均在三人中抽出一个。在比重上，以职员抽出最多，共计抽出职员占总数的百分之五十六点六。抽出大批人员以后，每月的工资开支比去年节省了十一万多元，生产成本比去年实际成本可降低百分之六点七。职工的比例也趋于合理，基本工人达到了百分之六十以上，技术人员和职员只占全员总数的百分之十左右。这就使劳动生产率得以迅速提高，去年三月每一个职工创造的价值是二百三十一元，今年四月已达到三百三十五元，提高了百分之四十五，抽出来的人员，大部分输送给总厂内的新建厂矿，正在学习文化或技术；一部分用来支援了外地或本溪钢铁公司内部的厂矿；还有一部分在为厂内基本建设的需要生产砖瓦砂石。总之，全部得到了适当地安排，正在新的岗位上积极地工作和学习。
