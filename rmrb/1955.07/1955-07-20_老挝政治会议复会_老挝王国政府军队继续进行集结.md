Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: Lao sources report: The Lao Political Conference has resumed on July 15th, with representatives from the International Control Commission in Laos also attending.

    The Lao Fighting Units delegation is led by Phoumi Vongvichit, and the Royal Lao Government delegation is led by Chao Như Ý.

    According to the Lao "Liberation Newspaper," the Lao Fighting Units delegation raised the following main issues during the discussion of the political agenda:

    1.  Holding free general elections, seeking all possible ways to unite all Lao citizens in the common life of the nation;
    2.  Guaranteeing all democratic freedoms in Laos;
    3.  Discussing the establishment of an administrative organization in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly.

    However, the Royal Lao Government delegation insisted on discussing the establishment of a royal administrative organization in the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua first, before discussing the issue of general elections. Therefore, the two sides did not reach an agreement on the conference agenda.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 19th: The Royal Lao Government is assembling aircraft and transferring many more battalions of troops from Savannakhet and Pakse to the Muong Hiem area in order to cooperate with the Royal forces in Muong Bon to occupy Sam Neua city, Highway 6, and the Sam River basin.

    The Lao Fighting Units have had to resist in order to defend themselves and protect the residents, preventing the Royal Lao Army from infiltrating their assembly areas.
