Strive to Realize the Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce

Xu Dixing, Deputy Director of the Eighth Office of the State Council

I.

Based on the nation's socialist industrialization, and in accordance with socialist principles, gradually transforming capitalist industry and commerce is one of the great historical tasks that our people must achieve during the transition period. According to the country's overall task during the transition period, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, we must basically bring capitalist industry and commerce into the orbit of various forms of state capitalism, and establish the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

In the past, China's national bourgeoisie, under the leadership of the working class, participated in the national democratic revolution. After the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, they recognized the leading role of the working class in the country and, under the leadership of the state and the working class, participated in the patriotic movement and economic recovery work. After the state and the working class conducted multiple serious struggles against their illegal activities, many capitalists recognized the general trend and expressed their willingness to accept socialist transformation. At the same time, China's original economy was very backward. In 1949, the output value of modern industry only accounted for about 17 percent of the total output value of industry and agriculture; and scattered and backward small-scale production accounted for an absolute advantage in the national economy. Under such circumstances, capitalist industry and commerce, on the one hand, had a negative impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, and on the other hand, also had a positive impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. The state needs to make as much use as possible of the positive role of capitalism to expand production, accumulate funds, train technical personnel, maintain social employment, and assist socialist commerce in expanding commodity circulation to meet the growing needs of the people. The above-mentioned circumstances require that in the stage of socialist revolution, we do not adopt the method of confiscating capitalist property to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system.

However, the capitalist ownership of the means of production hinders the further development of our country's productive forces. The anarchic state of the capitalist economy is opposed to the planned development of the socialist economy. With the development of the socialist economy, and with the strengthening and improvement of the state's planned leadership over the national economy, the contradictions between the capitalist economy and the socialist economy become more obvious and more acute. Therefore, we must carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Under China's specific conditions, due to the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic power led by the working class, and due to the increasing strength of the socialist state-owned economy, which has become the leading force of the entire national economy, we can rely on the people's democratic power and social forces led by the working class to adopt gradual and prudent transitional methods for capitalist industry and commerce, that is, through the form of state capitalism, and after a considerable period of time, to achieve socialist nationalization.

The Chinese Communist Party's policy on state capitalism is based on Lenin's theory on state capitalism under the New Economic Policy, and is the result of creatively applying this theory to China's specific conditions. Lenin once pointed out that under the conditions that the working class has seized power, state capitalism is a kind of capitalism that can be restricted and can define its boundaries, and is a stepping stone to socialism. In Russia at that time, because the bourgeoisie's industries, mines, railways, etc. had been confiscated by the Soviet state, and socialist industry developed rapidly, the state capitalist economy did not gain much development in the Soviet Union at that time. But in China, due to the above-mentioned historical conditions, and due to the above-mentioned characteristics of the national bourgeoisie, it still retains a considerable production base. Therefore, it is possible and necessary for us to gradually and steadily transform capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises through various forms of state capitalism.

Under China's specific historical conditions, state capitalism is a transitional form for the state to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Through this form of state capitalism, favorable conditions can be created for replacing capitalist ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people in the future. Doing so is in line with the long-term interests of the working class and the working people; it is conducive to uniting the national bourgeoisie to jointly oppose imperialist aggression, defend national independence and world peace; it is conducive to gradually weakening the bourgeoisie's resistance to socialist transformation, avoiding as much as possible all avoidable destruction, and using capitalism's positive role in the economy to promote the forward development of the national economy, and using the skills of bourgeois elements to serve national construction; it is also conducive to the state's calmly transforming and arranging the large number of small and medium-sized capitalist enterprises, so as not to make the state suddenly "shoulder the unbelievable burden of arranging jobs and guaranteeing the lives of millions of newly unemployed people." (Stalin: On the Program of the Communist International)

II.

According to incomplete statistics, China's capitalist industry had more than two million employees in 1953, and its output value accounted for 37 percent of the country's total industrial output value. In the total output value of capitalist industry, modern industry accounted for 73 percent and handicraft industry accounted for 27 percent in 1953, but in terms of the number of enterprises, handicraft industry accounted for the absolute majority. The regional distribution is also very uneven, with the output value of capitalist industry in Shanghai and Tianjin accounting for about half of the national capitalist industry output value.

At present, in terms of output value, the vast majority of capitalist industry has been incorporated into the intermediate form of state capitalism. In the early days of liberation, the form of state capitalism was mainly low-level, that is, state-owned enterprises purchased the products of capitalist enterprises. According to statistics from twelve major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, the intermediate forms of state capitalism—processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales—have been developing year by year since 1950. By 1954, the output value of processing and ordering had accounted for more than 90 percent of the output value of private industry in eight major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. All these intermediate forms have a common basic characteristic, that is, socialist economic components and capitalist economic components mainly conduct contact and cooperation outside the enterprise. The socialist economic components basically control the supply of raw materials and the sales of products of capitalist industry, and through processing and ordering contracts and the supervision of the masses of workers, the production of these capitalist industries is brought into the orbit of the state plan, restricting their anarchic state of production to varying degrees. Through these forms, the state restricts the profits of capitalists and restricts the exploitation of workers by capitalists; and makes a part of the value of some processed and exclusively sold commodities return to the state in the form of commercial profits, increasing the accumulation of state funds. Through these forms, capitalist industry produces not only for profit, but also for the needs of the state plan and the people, which makes the masses of workers feel interested in their work, and on this basis, gradually increase the labor productivity of workers. Through these forms, the state-owned economy can continuously expand its control over finished products and raw materials, gradually cut off the connection between capitalist industry and capitalist commerce, thereby severing the capitalist system. This makes the capitalist economy further dependent on the state-owned economy; and makes the production scale and development of capitalist industrial enterprises accepting processing, ordering, and exclusive sales determined by the needs of the people and the state plan.

However, under the intermediate form of state capitalism, the enterprise is still owned by the capitalist, and the enterprise's operation and management are basically carried out in accordance with the capitalist method. Therefore, the contradictions between public and private, labor and capital, and many other contradictions, cannot be effectively resolved. In the relationship between public and private, although some capitalists can obey the interests of the state and complete the tasks entrusted by the state in terms of quantity, quality, and time: but there are still many capitalists who adopt a profit-seeking attitude. Some of them resist the state's processing and ordering tasks; some of them do not complete the tasks in terms of quantity, quality, and time; some of them engage in illegal activities such as cutting corners, using inferior products as good ones, and falsely reporting costs. This causes great harm to the country's economic construction and national defense construction. In the labor-capital relationship, the capitalist's corrupt operation and management and the bad behavior of some capitalists in corroding workers have caused confusion in the wage system. This situation not only increases costs, increases the burden on the state-owned economy and the people, but also hinders the enthusiasm of the employees and the spirit of production innovation, and affects the wage system of state-owned enterprises and the unity within the working class. The existence and development of the above-mentioned contradictions become obstacles to improving the labor productivity of enterprises and developing social productive forces, and also become obstacles to educating and transforming capitalists and capitalist agents. Thus, it is necessary to gradually push these industries from the intermediate form of state capitalism to the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership.

Joint state-private enterprises are enterprises invested by the state and jointly operated by state-appointed cadres and capitalists. When a capitalist enterprise is transformed into a joint state-private enterprise, the production relations of the enterprise undergo the following changes: (1) The enterprise changes from private ownership to joint public-private ownership, and socialist components cooperate with capitalist components within the enterprise and occupy a leading position. Therefore, the operation and management of joint venture enterprises gradually align with state-owned enterprises, and gradually take the requirements of the state plan as the guiding principle. Here, the basic socialist economic laws and the laws of planned development of the national economy play a leading role in joint state-private enterprises. Of course, it is impossible for the capitalist operating ideas of capitalists and capitalist agents to be completely changed all at once. Within joint state-private enterprises, there is often a struggle between capitalist operating ideas and socialist operating ideas. Only after a serious struggle, only after educating and transforming the bourgeoisie, can capitalist operating ideas be overcome in joint venture enterprises, and only then can the basic socialist laws not be hindered when playing their role. (2) In joint state-private enterprises, the public side and the masses of employees unite and occupy a leading position. Many excellent workers have been promoted to various leadership positions in the enterprise. Therefore, the employees take a master attitude towards the enterprise, and labor enthusiasm and labor productivity are greatly improved. Due to the improvement of labor enthusiasm, joint state-private enterprises can accumulate funds better than in the private sector, improve production equipment better, and expand production scale better to support socialist construction and meet the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of society. (3) The joint state-private ownership of enterprises changes the status of capitalists in controlling enterprises during the private sector. They are now not in a dominant position in the enterprise, but in a position of being led. Capitalists and capitalist agents receive direct and regular leadership and education from the public side, and are supervised by the masses of employees. Therefore, it is possible to learn new things and new ideas in practice and gradually transform themselves. (4) Although the exploitation of surplus value has not been eliminated in joint state-private enterprises, it occupies an unimportant position. When distributing the surplus of the enterprise, the capitalist can only obtain a certain share in the dividends according to the proportion of public and private shares. This fact shows that in joint state-private enterprises, the law of surplus value has lost its dominant role.

The above-mentioned changes make joint state-private enterprises enterprises of a semi-socialist nature; and make joint state-private enterprises a form that facilitates the transformation of capitalist enterprises and the transformation of bourgeois elements and combines the two. Socialist components in joint state-private enterprises will continuously improve the operation and management of enterprises, better implement state plans, develop production, ensure supply, continuously improve the awareness and organization of employees, continuously transform bourgeois elements, and calmly and properly prepare conditions for future nationalization. Therefore, the state's transformation of capitalist industry will mainly be carried out through joint state-private ownership.

In the past few years, a considerable number of capitalist industries have been transformed into joint state-private ownership. By 1953, there were a total of 1,036 enterprises in the country that implemented joint state-private ownership, and their output value accounted for 5.7 percent of the country's total industrial output value. Since 1954, the state has been carrying out planned expansion of joint state-private ownership throughout the country. In that year, about 800 capitalist enterprises were transformed into joint state-private enterprises. As a result, the proportion of the output value of joint state-private industry in the country's total industrial output value reached 12 percent; and the proportion in the country's capitalist industrial output value accounted for about one-third. During the first five-year plan period, most of the capitalist modern industry will be transformed into joint state-private industry; but at the same time, a part of the smaller private small and medium-sized industries will also be transformed into joint state-private industry under the conditions of transforming by industry and large leading small.

The experience of the past few years has proven that to smoothly expand joint state-private ownership, it is necessary to combine the socialist transformation of capitalist industry with the state's production, supply, and sales plan. This requires implementing the state's policy of overall consideration for various economic components, and under this policy, adopting the method of carrying out comprehensive arrangements in each industry and in the original industry to transform private industry. For those that are qualified for joint venture, joint state-private ownership will be carried out; for those that need to prepare conditions, guidance will be provided to improve production and operation, improve production technology, and carry out production reorganization in order to further carry out joint state-private ownership; for those that need to be relocated and may be relocated, assistance will be provided for relocation, and joint venture will be carried out under certain conditions; for those that do not have the conditions for transformation, their enterprises should be eliminated step by step and their personnel arranged. Carrying out unified production arrangements and transformation by industry is a complex and arduous task. Therefore, we must do all the preparatory work and adhere to the policy of steady progress.

The state invests the necessary funds in enterprises to implement joint state-private ownership, but this is only to use the original personnel and equipment to transform capitalist enterprises, rather than to use state funds to replace private capital by buying stocks. Because the leading position and leading role of socialist components in joint venture enterprises, and the continuous strengthening of this leading position and leading role, do not depend on the amount of state investment, but depend on the nature of the state power and the position of the socialist economy in the national economy, depend on the combination of the public representatives and the masses of employees in the enterprise and their education and transformation of capitalists and their agents, and depend on whether this leadership can indeed promote the progress of the enterprise. Therefore, the ideas and practices of hoping that the state will invest a large amount of funds in joint state-private enterprises, or use state funds to replace private capital, are all wrong.

State capitalism is a transitional form for transforming capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises. After capitalist industry is transformed into joint state-private ownership, it will be transformed into socialist enterprises in the future, but this is not today's task. Our task today is to gradually transform capitalist industry into joint state-private enterprises, and to transform enterprises and transform bourgeois elements in joint state-private ownership. We know that there are complex and profound struggles within joint state-private enterprises, and it is not an easy task to do a good job in enterprise transformation and the transformation of bourgeois elements. The time required from joint state-private ownership to the implementation of socialist nationalization is not short. If someone confuses the implementation of joint state-private ownership with the implementation of socialist nationalization, and believes that the implementation of joint state-private ownership is to abolish capitalist ownership, this view is clearly wrong.

III.

In 1953, China's private commerce had nearly 200,000 employees in wholesalers nationwide, about 2 million employees in retailers, and several million small merchants and peddlers. The characteristics of private commerce are that there are many households, many people, little capital, and small scale. In urban retailers, the number of family businesses and peddlers who do not employ shop assistants is very large; in rural private merchants, commercial capitalists account for only less than 2 percent; and the rest are small merchants and peddlers who have no capital or very little capital and do not employ shop assistants.

Since China entered the period of planned economic construction, due to the continuous improvement of people's lives, it takes a period of time for many newly built industries to increase the output of consumer goods and agricultural production materials, and there is still a considerable amount of scattered and backward individual economy in agriculture. Therefore, a new trend has emerged that the speed of growth of social purchasing power is increasingly exceeding the speed of growth of consumer goods and agricultural production materials. The existence of the free market and the disturbance of speculative merchants have given great difficulties to guaranteeing supply and have deepened the severity of this contradiction. In order to ensure the needs of the people, eliminate speculation, and stabilize market prices, the state has successively implemented planned purchase and planned supply of grain, edible oil, cotton cloth, and cotton; at the same time, it has expanded processing, ordering, and exclusive sales for capitalist industry, and further controlled the source of goods of major industrial and agricultural products and the wholesale links in commodity circulation. At this point, socialist commerce has become the leading force in all aspects of commercial activities in the country. The proportion of private wholesalers' turnover in the country's total domestic wholesale volume has decreased from about 30 percent in 1953 to about 10 percent in 1954. The economic ties between private commerce and farmers' small producers, and between private commerce and urban industry and handicrafts, have been largely severed. This is a great victory in the "who will win" struggle we have carried out in the commodity market. However, due to the sudden increase in wholesale business and business varieties, the organization and operating capacity of state-owned commercial wholesale business cannot meet the requirements of the work, so that the phenomenon of overstocking here and stockouts there has occurred in some secondary commodities. In order to solve the livelihood problems of the employees of these replaced private wholesalers, and to fully utilize their experience, technology, and business relations to improve the wholesale business of state-owned commerce, the state has adopted the method of having state-owned commerce absorb the employees of private wholesalers (including shop assistants and capitalists) who have been replaced by socialist commerce separately by industry and business, and become the staff of state-owned commercial wholesale institutions. For small wholesalers and urban and rural small merchants and peddlers who operate secondary commodities, they are allowed to continue to operate commodities that state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises do not operate or cannot operate under the management of state administrative organs and the leadership and supervision of socialist commerce. For the small number of wholesalers who can continue to operate at present, they will be allowed to continue to operate for a certain period of time, or they will be changed into agents for state-owned commercial wholesale business.

We cannot take the method of exclusion and replacement for private retail commerce as we do for private wholesalers. To replace the private retailers in urban and rural areas across the country, we would have to shoulder the heavy burden of solving the employment and livelihood problems for nearly 10 million employees and their families. This is unthinkable. For urban private retailers, they must mainly be gradually transformed through various forms of state capitalism. After the implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of grain, edible oil, and cotton cloth, private retailers in these three industries have been brought into the orbit of state capitalism throughout the country; in retailers in other industries, state capitalism has also developed greatly. Experience shows that only by transforming the entire industry rather than individual stores into state capitalism can the phenomenon of increased business in a few stores and closure of most stores be avoided.

Due to the complexity of the commercial situation and the varying degrees of state control over commodities, state capitalism in the commercial sector needs to have various forms to adapt to different situations. Among them, the more developed forms of state capitalism are distribution (wholesale and retail also belong to this category) and consignment sales (consignment wholesale and consignment purchase also belong to this category). In addition, there are forms such as "joint state-private ownership" (mainly for commerce with processing characteristics), "joint state-private operation," and "joint state-private purchase," but in reality, they do not account for a large proportion.

After private commerce is brought into the orbit of state capitalism, their capitalist blindness is restricted to varying degrees; and to varying degrees, they assist socialist commerce in sharing the distribution and supply of social commodities. How much they sell, what they sell, how high the price is, and how much profit they make are all determined by socialist state-owned commerce. This characteristic is particularly evident in consignment stores. In consignment stores, because the goods are owned by the state, most of the private merchants' funds have been deposited into the state bank as a deposit, and the operating relationship in the consignment store has undergone major changes; the price of goods and the sales plan are completely controlled by socialist commerce, and the private merchants' blind operation and commercial profits have also been restricted; the status of employees within the enterprise has also changed, and the employees' work is mainly not for the profit of the capitalists, but to complete the state sales plan and serve the needs of the residents; not only is the supervisory role of employees in the consignment store gradually strengthened, but also they are subject to regular and widespread supervision by consumers. After a long period of education and transformation, the state capitalist consignment store is conducive to transforming the consignment store into a socialist sales institution and transforming the employees of private merchants into staff of state-owned commerce.

IV.

Gradually realizing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through state capitalism is a long-term, complex, acute, and profound class struggle of "who will win." As Lenin said, state capitalism "is the continuation of another form of class struggle, and it is by no means replacing class struggle with class peace." (On the Food Tax)

Practice has proven that after enterprises are brought into state capitalism, the bourgeoisie still adopts various methods to resist socialist transformation. The specific manifestations are: in distribution and consignment sales, private merchants engage in illegal activities such as adulterating, raising prices, lowering prices, embezzling state materials, and misappropriating state funds; in processing and ordering, capitalists have practices such as cutting corners, corrupting workers, and raising wages to damage the interests of the state; in joint state-private enterprises, some capitalists take the method of wooing and buying off senior staff and technical personnel, or take the method of provoking the relationship between the masses of workers and the representatives of the state in the enterprise, and provoking the relationship between cadres. Some even take the method of corrupting the state personnel dispatched to the joint state-private enterprises and the party, league, and trade union cadres in the enterprise, attempting to usurp the leadership of the enterprise, obstruct the reform of the enterprise, and try to make the operation and management of the enterprise subject to the capitalist profit-seeking policy. In response to this resistance and destructive behavior of capitalists, we must rely on the workers and carry out a profound and acute struggle in the dual transformation of transforming enterprises and transforming bourgeois elements.

The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a process of struggle and education. In this process, the transformation of enterprises must be combined with the transformation of people. The transformation of bourgeois elements (i.e., capitalists and their agents) is a serious political task. This work and the work of enterprise transformation are closely linked together. Only by carrying out enterprise transformation, only in the practice of enterprise transformation, can bourgeois elements clearly recognize the reactionary nature of the capitalist profit-seeking operating ideology, and can bourgeois elements gradually change in their ideology; at the same time, only by doing a good job in the ideological education of bourgeois elements, only by doing a good job in their patriotic education, can they actively accept enterprise transformation, and can we obtain assistance and reduce resistance when promoting enterprise transformation and when we transform state capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises in the future. According to the current situation, the transformation work for bourgeois elements lags behind the requirements of the objective situation. We must strengthen this work, we must universally and deeply publicize the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce; we must implement the state's policy on the legitimate rights and interests of the bourgeoisie; we must ensure that the bourgeois elements in joint state-private enterprises have jobs, rights, and responsibilities under the leadership of socialist components; we must struggle against and give due punishment to those illegal capitalists who continue to engage in the five poisons and resist state leadership, undermine the unity of the working class, and undermine the production and operation of enterprises. If we do not struggle against these illegal capitalists, if we do not give them due punishment, then our socialist transformation cause will be hindered and cannot move forward smoothly.

Under China's specific conditions, it is necessary and possible to transform bourgeois elements. Due to the consolidation of the people's democratic power based on the worker-peasant alliance, due to the continuous development and strengthening of the socialist economy, due to the continuous development of the individual economy towards the road of cooperativization, due to the increasing awareness and organization of the masses of workers, due to the support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries for China's socialist construction, and due to the continuous differentiation of the national bourgeoisie, the progressive elements who play a leading and bridge role are increasing day by day, the middle elements who take a passive attitude towards socialist transformation will tend to be more active, and the reactionary elements who resolutely resist transformation and undermine transformation will become increasingly isolated—all this shows that socialism is the general trend, all this shows that the majority of bourgeois elements can gradually accept socialist transformation.

In order to build the motherland into a brilliant socialist country, we must strive to realize the socialist transformation of the country's capitalist industry and commerce!

    为实现国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而奋斗
    国务院第八办公室副主任　许涤新
    一
    在国家的社会主义工业化的基础上，按照社会主义的原则，逐步地改造资本主义工商业，是我国人民在过渡时期必须实现的伟大历史任务之一。根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，在第一个五年计划期间内，我们必须在基本上把资本主义工商业分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。
    中国的民族资产阶级在过去曾经在工人阶级领导下参加了民族民主革命，在新民主主义革命胜利之后，承认工人阶级对国家的领导地位；并在国家和工人阶级的领导下，参加了爱国运动和经济恢复工作。经过国家和工人阶级对他们的不法行为进行多次的严重斗争以后，许多资本家认清了大势所趋，表示愿意接受社会主义改造。同时，中国原来的经济是十分落后的。现代工业的产值在一九四九年只约占工农业总产值的百分之十七；而分散落后的小生产，在国民经济中占绝对的优势。在这种情况之下，资本主义工商业一方面具有不利于国计民生的消极作用，一方面也还具有有利于国计民生的积极作用。国家需要尽可能地利用资本主义的这种积极作用，去扩大生产，积累资金，训练技术人材，维持社会就业，协助社会主义商业扩大商品流转，以供应人民日益增长的需要。上述这些情况要求我们在社会主义革命阶段，不采用没收资本家财产的办法去消灭资本主义的剥削制度。
    但是，资本主义的生产资料所有制妨碍着我国生产力的进一步发展。资本主义经济的无政府状态同社会主义经济的有计划发展是相对立的。随着社会主义经济的发展，随着国家对于国民经济的计划领导的加强和提高，资本主义经济同社会主义经济之间的矛盾，就更加显露，更加尖锐。因此，我们必须对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。在我国的具体条件之下，由于工人阶级领导的人民民主政权的日益巩固，由于社会主义国营经济的日益壮大并已成为整个国民经济的领导力量，我们就可以依靠工人阶级领导的人民民主政权和社会力量，对资本主义工商业采取逐渐而慎重的过渡的办法，即通过国家资本主义的形式，经过一个相当长的时间，达到社会主义的国有化。
    中国共产党关于国家资本主义的方针，是根据列宁关于新经济政策下国家资本主义问题的理论，并把这种理论创造性地应用于中国具体条件下的结果。列宁曾经指明在工人阶级已经掌握政权的条件下，国家资本主义是能够加以限制，能够规定其界限的一种资本主义，是走向社会主义的一个门阶。在当时的俄国，由于资产阶级的工业、矿山和铁路等等已被苏维埃国家没收，而社会主义工业又迅速地发展起来，所以国家资本主义经济在当时的苏联就没有获得什么发展。但在中国，由于上述的历史条件，由于民族资产阶级具有上述的特点，它还保有不小的生产基础，因此，我们有可能和必要，经过各种形式的国家资本主义，将资本主义企业逐渐地稳步地改造为社会主义企业。
    在中国的具体历史条件之下，国家资本主义是国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的过渡形式。经过国家资本主义这种形式，就可以为将来用全民所有制代替资本家所有制造成有利的条件。这样做，是符合工人阶级和劳动人民的长远利益的；是有利于联合民族资产阶级来共同反对帝国主义的侵略，保卫国家的独立和世界和平；有利于逐步削弱资产阶级对社会主义改造的反抗，尽量避免一切可以避免的破坏，并利用资本主义在经济上的积极作用来推进国民经济的向前发展，利用资产阶级分子的技能来为国家建设服务；也有利于国家从容地改造和安排为数众多的中小资本主义企业，而不致使国家一下子就“肩负起替千百万人为的新的失业者安排工作和保证生活的难以置信的重担”。（斯大林：论共产国际纲领）
     二
    中国的资本主义工业，据不完全的统计，一九五三年从业人员有二百多万人，产值占全国工业总产值的百分之三十七。在全部资本主义工业的产值中，一九五三年现代工业占百分之七十三，工场手工业占百分之二十七，但从企业的户数来看，则工场手工业占了绝对多数。在地区分布上也很不平衡，上海、天津两市的资本主义工业产值，即占了全国资本主义工业的产值一半左右。
    目前资本主义工业，就产值说，绝大部分已被纳入国家资本主义的中级形式。在解放初期，国家资本主义的形式主要是低级的，即国营企业收购资本主义企业的产品。据上海、天津、北京等十二大城市的统计，从一九五○年起，中级形式的国家资本主义——加工、订货、统购、包销则逐年在发展。到了一九五四年，加工订货的产值已占了北京、天津、上海等八大城市的私营工业产值的百分之九十以上。所有这些中级形式，都有一个共同的基本特点，就是社会主义经济成分和资本主义经济成分，主要地在企业外部，进行联系和合作，社会主义经济成分基本上掌握了资本主义工业的原料供应和产品销售，并通过加工订货的合同和工人群众的监督，使这些资本主义工业的生产，纳入国家计划的轨道，在不同程度上，限制它们的生产无政府状态。经过这些形式，国家限制了资本家的利润，限制了资本家对于工人的剥削；并使某些加工包销的商品的一部分价值，以商业利润的形式归于国家，增加国家资金的积累。经过这些形式，资本主义工业就不仅为着利润而生产，而且为着国家计划和人民的需要而生产，这就使工人群众对自己的劳动感到有兴趣，并在此基础上，逐步提高工人的劳动生产率。经过这些形式，国营经济就能不断地扩大其对于成品和原料的控制，逐步地切断了资本主义工业和资本主义商业的联系，从而割裂了资本主义的体系。这就使资本主义经济更进一步依赖国营经济；使接受加工、订货和包销的资本主义工业企业的生产规模和它的发展，决定于人民需要和国家计划。
    但在国家资本主义中级形式之下，企业仍为资本家所有，企业的经营管理基本上仍按照资本主义的方式去进行，因此，公私矛盾、劳资矛盾和其他许多矛盾，都不能获得有效的处理。在公私关系上，虽然有一部分资本家能够服从国家的利益，按量、按质、按时完成国家委托的任务：但还有不少资本家采取唯利是图的态度，他们有的抗拒国家的加工订货的任务；有的不按量、按质、按时完成任务；有的进行偷工减料、以坏顶好、虚报成本等违法活动。这对国家经济建设和国防建设，发生很大的危害。在劳资关系上，资本主义的腐败的经营管理和一些资本家腐蚀工人的恶劣行为，使工资制度发生了混乱状态。这种情况，不但增加成本、增加国营经济和人民的负担，而且阻碍了职工群众的劳动热情和生产革新精神的提高，影响了国营企业的工资制度和工人阶级内部的团结。上述这些矛盾的存在和发展，成为提高企业劳动生产率和发展社会生产力的障碍，也成为对资本家和资本家代理人进行教育改造的障碍。这样，便需要将这些工业由国家资本主义中级形式，逐步推向国家资本主义高级形式——公私合营。
    公私合营企业是由国家投资并由国家派干部同资本家合营的企业。当资本主义企业转变为公私合营之后，企业的生产关系就发生下列变化：（一）企业由私有变为公私共有，社会主义成分在企业内部同资本主义成分合作，并居于领导地位。因之，合营企业的经营管理，就逐步向国营企业看齐，逐步以国家计划的要求为指导方针。在这里，社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划发展的规律，就在公私合营企业内起主导作用。当然，公私合营企业的资本家和资本家代理人的资本主义经营思想，不可能一下子就完全改变。在公私合营企业内部，经常要发生资本主义经营思想和社会主义经营思想的斗争。只有经过严肃的斗争，只有对资产阶级分子进行教育改造，才能在合营企业内克服资本主义的经营思想，才能使社会主义基本规律在发挥其作用时，不受到障碍。（二）在公私合营企业中，公方和职工群众结合一起居于领导地位。很多优秀的工人，被提拔到企业的各种领导岗位上来。因此，职工群众对待企业采取了主人翁的态度，劳动积极性和劳动生产率就大大提高。由于劳动积极性的提高，公私合营企业，比较在私营时期，更能积累资金，更能改善生产设备，更能扩大生产规模以支持社会主义建设，并满足社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。（三）企业的公私合营，改变了资本家在私营时期支配企业的地位。他们现在不是处在企业的支配地位，而是处在被领导的地位。资本家和资本家代理人受到公方直接经常的领导和教育，得到职工群众的监督，因而有可能在实践中学习新事物和新思想，逐步改造他们自己。（四）剩余价值的剥削在公私合营企业内虽未消灭，但占不重要的地位。资本家在分配企业的盈余时，只能在股息红利中，按照公私股份的比重，取得一定的份额。这种事实说明：在公私合营企业中，剩余价值规律是失去了支配作用的。
    上述的这些变化，使公私合营企业成为半社会主义性质的企业；使公私合营企业成为便利于改造资本主义企业和改造资产阶级分子并使两者结合起来的形式。社会主义成分在公私合营企业中将不断地改善企业的经营管理，更好地贯彻国家计划，发展生产，保证供应，不断地提高职工的觉悟性和组织性，不断地改造资产阶级分子，从容地妥善地为将来国有化准备条件。因此，国家对资本主义工业的改造，主要将经过公私合营来进行。
    几年来，资本主义工业转变为公私合营的已有相当数量。到一九五三年，全国实行公私合营的企业，共一、○三六户，产值占全国工业总产值的百分之五点七。国家从一九五四年起，在全国范围内，进行了有计划地扩展公私合营的工作。这一年约有八百户的资本主义企业改造为公私合营企业。这么一来，公私合营工业的产值，在全国工业总产值中的比重，就达到百分之十二；在全国资本主义工业产值中的比重，占了三分之一左右。在第一个五年计划期间，资本主义现代工业的大部分将转变为公私合营工业；但同时有一部分规模较小的私营中小工业，亦将在按业改造、以大带小的条件下，转变为公私合营工业。
    过去几年的工作经验证明：要顺利地扩展公私合营，必须将对资本主义工业的社会主义改造工作和国家的产供销计划相结合。这就要贯彻国家对各种经济成分的统筹兼顾的方针，并在这个方针之下，采取逐行逐业并在原行业中采取全面安排的办法，进行对于私营工业的改造。对于有条件实行合营的就进行公私合营；对于需要准备条件的就辅导其改善生产经营，改善生产技术并进行生产改组，以便进一步进行公私合营；对于需要而可能迁移的就协助其迁移，并在一定条件下进行合营；对于没有改造条件的，就应有步骤地淘汰其企业安排其人员。按行业统一地进行生产安排和改造，是一件复杂而繁重的事情，因此，我们必须做好一切准备工作，坚持稳步前进的方针。
    国家对企业实行公私合营，要投入必需的资金，但这只是为了利用原有的人员和设备，去改造资本主义企业，而不是以收买股票的方法，用国家资金去代替私人资本。因为社会主义成分在合营企业中的领导地位和领导作用，以及这种领导地位和领导作用的不断加强，不是取决于国家投资数量，而是取决于国家政权的性质和社会主义经济在国民经济中的地位，取决于企业中公方代表同职工群众的结合和他们对于资本家及其代理人的教育改造工作，取决于这种领导能够确实地推动企业向前进步。因此，那种希望国家对公私合营企业投下大量资金，或者用国家资金去代替私人资本的想法和做法，都是错误的。
    国家资本主义是资本主义企业改造为社会主义企业的过渡形式。资本主义工业转变为公私合营以后，将来还要转变为社会主义企业，但这不是今天的任务。我们今天的任务是在于将资本主义工业逐步地转变为公私合营企业，并在公私合营中进行改造企业和改造资产阶级分子。我们知道，公私合营企业内部存在着复杂而深刻的斗争，要做好企业改造和对资产阶级分子的改造，并不是一件轻易的事情。从公私合营到实行社会主义国有化，其所需的时间，并不是短促的。如果有人把实行公私合营和实行社会主义国有化，混为一谈，认为实行公私合营就是废除资本家所有制，这种看法分明是错误的。

    我国私营商业在一九五三年全国批发商的从业人员将近二十万人，零售商的从业人员有二百万人左右，小商小贩还有几百万人。私营商业的特点是户数多、人数多、资金少、规模小，城市零售商中不雇佣店员的家庭商户和摊贩的数量很大；在农村私商中，商业资本家只占百分之二弱；其余大都是没有资金或资金极少、不雇佣店员的小商小贩。
    我国进入有计划的经济建设时期以来，由于人民生活的不断改善，新建的许多工业要经过一个时期才能更多地增加消费品和农业生产资料产量，农业中还存在着相当大量的分散落后的个体经济，因此，就出现了社会购买力增长的速度日益超过消费品和农业生产资料生产增长的速度的新趋势。而自由市场的存在和投机商人的捣乱，给予保证供应以极大的困难，又加深了这一矛盾的严重性。为着保证人民的需要，消灭投机，稳定市场物价，国家对粮食，食用油脂以及棉布、棉花，先后实行了计划收购和计划供应；同时，并对资本主义工业扩大了加工、订货和包销，进一步地掌握了工农业主要产品的货源和商品流转中的批发环节，至此，社会主义商业就成为全国商业活动各方面的领导力量。私营批发商的营业额在全国国内批发总额中所占的比重，就由一九五三年的百分之三十左右下降到一九五四年的百分之十左右。私营商业同农民小生产者，同城市工业和手工业的经济联系，已经在很大程度上被割断了。这是我们在商品市场上所进行的“谁战胜谁”的斗争中的一个大胜利。但是，由于批发业务和经营品种的骤然大增，国营商业批发业务的机构和经营能力还不能适应工作的要求，以致在某些次要商品上，发生了此处积压彼处脱销的现象。为要解决这些被代替的私营批发商的从业人员的生活问题，为要充分利用他们的经验、技术和业务关系以改进国营商业的批发业务，国家对那些被社会主义商业所代替的私营批发商的从业人员（包括店员和资本家），采用由国营商业按行、按业地分别加以吸收，变为国营商业批发机构的工作人员的办法。对经营次要商品的小批发商和城乡小商贩，则在国家行政机关的管理和社会主义商业的领导监督之下，让他们继续经营那些国营和合作社商业还不经营或不可能经营的商品。对目前还能继续经营的小部分批发商，则在一定时期中，让其继续经营，或将他们改变为替国营商业代理批发业务。
    我们对私营零售商业不可能像对私营批发商那样采取排除和代替的方法。要代替全国城乡的私营零售商，就要负担起替将近一千万从业人员和他们的家属解决职业和生活问题的重担。这是不可设想的。对城市的私营零售商，主要地必须经过国家资本主义的各种形式，逐步加以改造。在粮食、食油、棉布实行计划收购和计划供应后，这三个行业的私营零售商，已在全国范围内，整个行业纳入国家资本主义的轨道；在其他行业的零售商中，国家资本主义也有很大的发展。经验表明：只有将整个行业而不是将个别商店，转变为国家资本主义，才不致造成少数商店营业增加，多数商店因而停业关门的现象。
    由于商业情况复杂，国家对商品的掌握程度不一，商业方面的国家资本主义需要有多种形式来适应不同的情况，其中，比较发展了的国家资本主义形式是经销（批购零销亦属于这一类）、代销（代批、代购亦属于这一类）。此外，还有“公私合营”（主要是对带有加工性质的商业）“公私联营”及“公私联购”等形式，但实际上它们所占的比重并不大。
    私营商业被纳入国家资本主义的轨道后，它们的资本主义盲目性，就在不同程度上受到限制；并在不同程度上，协助社会主义商业，分担社会商品的分配和供应。他们销售多少、销售什么、价格多高、利润多大，都要由社会主义国营商业来决定。这种特点，在代销商店中特别显著。在代销商店中，因为商品是国家所有，私商的大部分资金已作为保证金存入国家银行，代销店中的经营关系已发生重大变化；商品的价格和销售计划完全受社会主义商业控制，私商的盲目经营和商业利润也就受到了限制；职工在企业内部的地位也改变了，职工的劳动主要地已经不是为资本家的利润，而是为完成国家销售计划，为供应居民的需要服务；代销店中不仅职工的监督作用逐步增强，而且受到消费者的经常和广泛的监督。国家资本主义代销店经过长时期教育、改造工作后，就有利于将代销商店转变为社会主义的销售机构，将私商从业人员改变为国营商业的工作人员。

    经过国家资本主义逐步实现对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是长期的、复杂的、尖锐的和深刻的“谁战胜谁”的阶级斗争。正如列宁所说，国家资本主义“是阶级斗争另一形式底继续，决不是用阶级和平来代替阶级斗争”。（论粮食税）
    实践证明资产阶级在企业纳入国家资本主义以后，仍采用各种办法来对抗社会主义改造，具体表现是：在经销代销中，私商有掺杂掺假、抬价跌价、盗用国家物资、挪用国家资金等违法活动；在加工订货中，资本家有偷工减料、腐蚀工人和提高工资等损害国家利益的作法；在公私合营企业中，有些资本家采取拉拢、收买高级职员和技术人员的办法，或者采取挑拨工人群众同国家在企业中的代表的关系，挑拨干部相互间的关系的办法，有的甚至采取腐蚀国家派遣在公私合营企业中的工作人员及企业中的党、团、工会干部的办法，企图篡夺企业领导权，阻挠企业改革，设法使企业的经营管理，服从于资本主义唯利是图的方针。针对着资本家这种抗拒行为和破坏行为，我们必须依靠工人，在贯彻改造企业和改造资产阶级分子的双重改造中，进行着深刻而尖锐的斗争。
    对资本主义工商业的改造是一个斗争和教育的过程，在这个过程中必须把对企业的改造和对人的改造结合起来。对于资产阶级分子（即资本家及其代理人）的改造，是一件严重的政治工作。这一工作和企业改造的工作，是密切地结合在一起的。只有进行企业改造，只有在企业改造的实践中，才能使资产阶级分子明确地认清资本主义的唯利是图的经营思想的反动本质，才能使资产阶级分子在思想意识上逐渐发生变化；同时，只有做好对资产阶级分子的思想教育，只有做好对他们的爱国主义的教育，才能使他们积极地接受企业改造，才能使我们在推动企业改造的时候，才能使我们在将来将国家资本主义企业转变为社会主义企业的时候，获得助力，减少阻力。照目前的情况来看，对于资产阶级分子的改造工作，是落后于客观形势的要求的。我们必须加强这方面的工作，必须普遍地深入地宣传国家对于资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策；必须贯彻国家对资产阶级合法权益的政策；必须使公私合营企业中的资产阶级分子，在社会主义成分的领导之下，有职有权、守职尽责；必须对那些继续进行五毒行为和对抗国家领导、破坏工人阶级团结、破坏企业生产经营的不法资本家，进行斗争并给以应得的处分。对于这些不法资本家，如果不进行斗争，如果不给予应得的处分，那就会使我们的社会主义改造事业，受到障碍而不能顺利地前进。
    在我国的具体条件下，对资产阶级分子进行改造，是必要的，也是可能的。由于以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权的巩固，由于社会主义经济的不断发展和壮大，由于个体经济不断地走上合作化的道路，由于工人群众的觉悟性和组织性的日益增强和提高，由于苏联和人民民主国家对我国社会主义建设的支援，又由于民族资产阶级的不断分化，发挥着带头作用和桥梁作用的进步分子日益增加，对社会主义改造采取被动态度的中间分子，将有更多的人趋向积极，而坚决抗拒改造和破坏改造的反动分子将日益孤立，——这一切，说明社会主义是大势所趋，这一切，说明资产阶级分子的大多数，是可能逐步接受社会主义改造的。
    为了把祖国建设成为一个光辉灿烂的社会主义国家，我们必须为实现国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而奋斗！
