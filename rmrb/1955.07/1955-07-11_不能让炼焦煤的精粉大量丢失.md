    Large-Scale Loss of Coking Coal Fine Powder Must Be Prevented
    Wang Huadong
    Coking coal is an important raw material for smelting iron and steel. With the development of China's iron and steel industry, the demand for coking coal is also increasing. However, coking coal is only a portion of the total coal reserves; not all coal can be used for coking. Moreover, after coking coal is mined, it must be crushed and washed to become fine powder with a certain particle size, ash content, and low sulfur content in order to meet the needs of coking. In addition to mining new coking coal, an important and effective measure to expand the production of coking coal is to improve the recovery rate of fine powder during washing and beneficiation. Last year, as a result of the efforts of coking coal production units across the country in this regard, several tens of thousands of tons of fine powder were recovered for the state throughout the year.
    However, up to now, the coking coal washing plants have also been allowing large-scale loss of fine powder for a long time. Taking last year as an example, in Benxi alone, more than 100,000 tons of fine powder containing small particles were lost in the coal slime. If we add the fine powder lost by washing plants in Fushun, Jixi, and Tonghua due to the same reason, the total number will be close to 250,000 tons. That is to say, the fine powder lost by these units alone is much more than the fine powder recovered by washing plants across the country with a lot of effort. Calculated at the current price, it is worth about ten million yuan. The rivers near these washing plants have changed color as a result, attracting residents on both sides to dig up coal slime. A large amount of fine powder from the Hegang washing plant flows into the Heli River with the coal slime, and many nearby residents dig it up and sell it in the city. Last year, the Heli River rose and flooded some civilian houses. After the water receded, a foot-thick layer of coal slime accumulated on the sleeping platforms of many civilian houses. What an astonishing waste!
    Some people say that the main reason for the loss of fine powder is the outdated equipment, low technical operation level, and low management level of the washing plants. These are certainly facts. However, are these facts unchangeable? Outdated equipment can be upgraded, and some washing plants are already undergoing upgrades; technical operation level and management level can be improved. What reason is there not to strive to improve the recovery rate of fine powder from these aspects, but to allow a large amount of valuable raw materials for smelting iron and steel to be lost in vain?
    Moreover, the so-called outdated equipment, etc., is actually just an excuse. The key to the problem is that some enterprise leaders and staff have not truly realized the loss caused to the country by the loss of fine powder. Therefore, they have not taken effective measures in this regard, and even the existing and feasible suggestions of the masses have not been supported by the leadership.
    The Jixi washing plant is one example. When this washing plant dewaters the fine powder, a lot of fine powder flows into the nearby river with the water. The residents on both sides of the river dig up these fine powder and use it as fuel, and they don't have to buy coal all year round; some residents who can't burn it all themselves sell it and use it as a source of living expenses. These fine powder flow into the river year after year, raising the riverbed higher and higher, so that the nearby farmland was flooded when the river rose last year. Can the phenomenon of fine powder loss in the Jixi washing plant be eliminated? Yes, and someone came up with a solution as early as the year before last. At that time, Zhong Jishuang, an old worker at the washing plant, and Li Weimin, a technician, went to the river to fish once, but they didn't catch anything for a long time. Later, they found that the bottom of the river was covered with coal powder, and there were no fish at all. This shocked them. They stopped fishing and went back to work together, painstakingly researched, and finally created a small vibrating screen. Installing this screen can recover a large amount of fine powder every day. If the screen holes are reduced, the problem of fine powder loss during dewatering can be basically solved. However, this relatively effective measure has not been valued by the leaders of the Jixi washing plant. Up to now, the Jixi washing plant still loses a lot of fine powder in terms of dewatering. What objective reason can explain this?
    In implementing the central government's comprehensive conservation policy, all coking coal washing plants must earnestly take measures and must no longer allow the large-scale loss of coking coal fine powder.

    不能让炼焦煤的精粉大量丢失
    汪华东
    炼焦煤是冶炼钢铁的重要原料，随着我国钢铁工业的发展，炼焦煤的需要量也不断增加。可是，炼焦煤只是煤的全部埋藏量中的一部分，并不是所有的煤都能炼焦；而且炼焦煤开采出来以后，还要经过破碎、洗选，成为一定粒度、一定灰分和含硫很少的精粉，才能合乎炼焦的需要。扩大炼焦煤的生产，除了开采新的炼焦煤外，一个十分重要和有效的措施，就是提高精粉的洗选回收率。去年全国生产炼焦煤的单位从这方面努力的结果，全年就为国家多回收了几万吨精粉。
    但是，一直到目前为止，各个生产炼焦煤的洗选厂，也同时有长期听任精粉大量丢失的现象。单以去年来说，仅本溪一个单位，在煤泥中丢失的含有小粒的精粉，就达十万多吨；如果再加上抚顺、鸡西和通化等洗选厂因同样原因而丢失的精粉，总数就接近二十五万吨。这就是说，仅这几个单位丢失的精粉，就比全国洗选厂费了不少力气多回收的精粉，还要多得多。如果按现在的价格计算，就值千万元左右。这些洗选厂附近的河流都因此变色，吸引了两岸的居民前来挖取煤泥。鹤岗洗选厂有大量精粉随煤泥流到鹤立河中，附近就有不少居民把它挖出来，到市上去贩卖。去年鹤立河水涨，淹了一些民房，等水退后很多民房的睡炕上竟积存了一市尺厚的煤泥。这是多么惊人的浪费啊！
    有人说，丢失精粉的主要原因是洗选厂的设备陈旧，技术操作水平和管理水平低。这些当然是事实。但是，难道这些事实是不能改变的吗？设备陈旧可以进行改造，有的洗选厂已在进行改造；技术操作水平和管理水平低可以提高。有什么理由不从这些方面去努力提高精粉的回收率，却听任大量冶炼钢铁的宝贵原料白白丢失呢？
    况且，所谓设备陈旧等等，实际上不过是一种借口。问题的关键还在于有些企业领导工作人员并没有真正认识丢失精粉给国家造成的损失，因此并没有在这方面采取有效措施，甚至群众已有的、可行的建议也没有得到领导的支持。
    鸡西洗选厂就是一例。这个洗选厂在精粉脱水时，有很多精粉顺水流到附近的河里去。河两岸的居民就把这些精粉挖出来当燃料，终年不要买煤；有的居民自己烧不完还拿去卖，并以此作为生活费用的来源。这些精粉常年不息地流到河里去，把河床越填越高，以致去年河水上涨时竟至淹了附近的农田。鸡西洗选厂丢失精粉的现象能不能消除呢？能，而且远在前年就有人想出了办法。那时，洗选厂的老工人钟继双和技术员李维民，有一次到河里去捕鱼，很久没捕到，后来发现河底都被煤粉铺满了，根本没有鱼。这使他们大吃一惊，也不捕鱼了，回去后两人合作，苦心研究，终于创造了一种小型震动筛子。装上这种筛子，每天可多回收大量的精粉，如果再把筛孔缩小，可以基本上解决脱水跑精粉的问题。但是，这个比较有效的措施，并没有被鸡西洗选厂领导上重视，到目前为止，鸡西洗选厂在脱水方面还有不少精粉跑失。这还有什么客观原因可以解释呢？
    在贯彻中央全面节约的方针中，各个洗选炼焦煤的洗选厂，都要认真采取措施，再也不能让炼焦煤的精粉大量丢失了。
