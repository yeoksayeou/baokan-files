　　The Traditional Friendly Relationship Between the Chinese and Vietnamese Peoples
　　Zhou Yiliang
    The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, is currently visiting our country at the invitation of our government. This is a major event in the history of friendly relations between China and Vietnam. It marks a new development in the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.
    The friendly relationship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples has a long historical tradition. Just by looking at a map of Asia, we can see that the same ocean embraces the southeastern borders of China and Vietnam, and countless rivers and streams nurture the people of both countries. Continuous high mountains and ridges run through and connect the borders of our two countries. Between our two countries, there is a contiguous zone of about a thousand kilometers. This natural geographical condition has enabled the people of our two countries to have close exchanges and live in harmony since ancient times. As President Ho Chi Minh said: "Our Vietnamese and Chinese peoples have shared the same bloodline and culture for thousands of years. Historically, we have been known as brotherly countries. Moreover, our lands are adjacent and our regions are connected, making us as close as lips and teeth, serving as mutual safeguards."
    According to archaeological materials, we can know that as early as more than 5,000 years ago, Chinese and Vietnamese cultures had many things in common. The stone tools discovered in northern Vietnam are almost identical to those discovered in Sichuan, China. Later on, the bronzes excavated in Thanh Hoa, northern Vietnam, are also very similar to the relics of the Warring States, Qin, and Han Dynasties in China. Chinese and Vietnamese history has also long recorded the relations of mutual exchange between the two countries. In the tenth century, an independent state was established in northern Vietnam, and although dynasties changed several times thereafter, they all maintained good relations with China.
    Mutual exchanges and migrations between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples have been common in history since the Qin and Han dynasties. The largest migration of Chinese to Vietnam in history occurred in 1679. At that time, Yang Yandi, the chief military officer of Longmen (Qinzhou) in Guangdong Province of the Ming Dynasty, and Vice General Jin Gao, Chen Shangchuan, the chief military officer of Gaozhou, Leizhou and Lianzhou, and Vice General Chen Anping, and others, because they "refused to serve the Qing Dynasty," led more than 3,000 people in fifty ships to Annam, sailing to Tourane, where they were welcomed by the Annam government. They later went to develop the southern region that Annam had not yet managed, namely the areas of Gia Dinh, Dinh Tuong, and Bien Hoa. They worked diligently there, settled down, and made this area a place where merchant ships from China, Japan, Java, and Western countries converged. Gia Dinh Province later developed into Saigon, the most prosperous commercial city in southern Vietnam.
    There are also many records of Vietnamese people coming to our country to live, do business, or work. During the Northern Song Dynasty, people from Jiaozhi and Champa often came to our country in whole families (sometimes several hundred at a time) and resided in Guangzhou, Chenzhou, Hainan Island, and other places. When Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty was managing the city of Beijing, Nguyen An, a Vietnamese, participated in the design work, and he also helped the Chinese people to control the river, making a significant contribution.
    Economic and trade relations between China and Vietnam began very early. About 200 years before the Common Era, there was already trade between the people of our country and Vietnam. Our country exchanged "gold, iron, field tools, horses, cattle, sheep" and "silks" for Vietnamese "rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, jadeite, pearls" and other items. By the Song Dynasty, Vietnam exported products from the South China Sea, such as tortoiseshell, rhinoceros horn, ivory, spices, betel nuts, and cardamom, to China, and imported paper, pens, straw mats, parasols, silk fans, lacquerware, porcelain, lead, tin, and books from China. There were also many facts about the exchange of production knowledge and technology. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the people of the two countries exchanged experience in smelting copper. In the first century AD, some people in northern Vietnam still lived by hunting. At that time, Ren Yan, the governor of Jiuzhen, introduced Chinese agricultural production methods to the Vietnamese, such as casting agricultural tools and cultivating wasteland, so that they turned from hunting to farming. Champa rice seeds from Vietnam began to be introduced into China during the Song Dynasty. In 1012 AD, Emperor Zhenzong of Song Dynasty, because the rice fields in Jianghuai and Liangzhe areas suffered a slight drought and resulted in poor harvests, distributed 30,000 hu of Champa rice seeds, which had already been planted in Fujian, to Jiangnan, Huainan, Liangzhe, and other places for promotion. Because Champa rice was longer and awnless than Chinese rice, was resistant to drought, and could grow regardless of the land, it was promoted in the Jianghuai and Liangzhe areas at that time, and later also in Henan.
    The cultural relations between China and Vietnam have deep roots, and they have been exchanging and influencing each other since a long time ago. It is said that Chinese characters began to be introduced into Vietnam around 100 BC and became widely used in Vietnam. In the fourteenth century, the Vietnamese created "Chu Nom" (i.e., Vietnamese script) based on Chinese characters and referring to the methods of creating characters in the Chinese six scripts. The "Truyen Kieu," a poem in luc bat meter written by Nguyen Du, a great Vietnamese poet of the nineteenth century, was written in "Chu Nom" and is still a great classic work known to the Vietnamese people. However, this script has the same shortcomings as Chinese characters: the script is complex and combines sound and meaning, so it must be reformed. Only by promoting the current new Latinized script has the Vietnamese people greatly advanced their culture. In addition to the common historical origin in writing, immortal classical literary works in our country, such as Dream of the Red Chamber, Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Journey to the West, have also been translated into Vietnamese and widely circulated in Vietnam, and are loved by the Vietnamese people. The costumes, music, and performance styles in Vietnamese dramas have many things in common with Chinese opera.
    What is even more valuable in the history of Sino-Vietnamese relations is that the people of the two countries have more than once fought side by side against the common enemy, imperialist aggression, since modern times. In the 1870s, French colonialists armed themselves and invaded Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people launched a struggle to resist aggression. In this struggle, the Chinese people gave strong support. According to historical records, in 1873, the French general Francis Garnier occupied Hanoi. The Chinese peasant armed Black Flag Army fought side by side with the Vietnamese people and defeated the French army. In the fierce battle of Paper Bridge near Hanoi in the spring of 1883, the French army was severely damaged again. In the Sino-French War of 1885, the Black Flag Army joined forces with the Vietnamese Volunteer Army to intercept the enemy in Lintao and won a great victory, severely hitting the French colonialists. Until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vietnamese peasants, led by the Vietnamese national hero Huang Hua Tam and others, carried out nearly 20 years of arduous guerrilla warfare against the French colonial army. Many surviving members of the Black Flag Army continued to fight alongside Vietnamese peasants to resist the French army.
    Since the beginning of this century, the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle for national independence and liberation. China's Xinhai Revolution, May Fourth Movement, May 30th Movement, and the First Revolutionary Civil War have had a tremendous impact and inspiration on the Vietnamese people. At the same time, the Vietnamese people have also expressed warm sympathy and support for the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement of the Chinese people. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Vietnam to carry out activities during the Xinhai Revolution, he received strong support from the Vietnamese people and overseas Chinese in Vietnam. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the workers of the Saigon Arsenal in Vietnam supported the struggle of the Chinese people by means of strikes. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the coast of China was blockaded by the Japanese invaders. The Vietnamese people transported anti-Japanese military supplies from Haiphong to China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. In September 1940, when the Japanese landed in northern Vietnam, the Vietnamese people held an uprising in Bac Son, which effectively prevented the Japanese army from using northern Vietnam as a military base to attack southwestern China.
    After the Second World War, the Chinese people greeted the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with excitement.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples entered a new stage. On January 18, 1950, China and Vietnam officially established diplomatic relations. Since then, the people of the two countries have been united more closely in the common struggle to defend Asian and world peace and resist the conspiracy of aggression by US imperialism. At the same time, the economic and cultural relations between the two countries have also been strengthened. There is no doubt that the visit of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh to our country will surely consolidate and develop the brotherly mutual assistance, cooperation, and friendly relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

　　中越两国人民的传统友好关系
　　周一良
    由胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团，应我国政府的邀请，目前正在我国访问。这是中越两国友好关系史上的一件大事。它标志着中越人民友谊的新的发展。
    中越两国人民的友好关系是有悠久的历史传统的。只要打开亚洲的地图，我们就可以看到：同一个海洋拥抱着中国和越南的东南边境，无数的大小河川共同养育着我们两国的人民。连绵不绝的高山峻岭贯穿和连接着我们两国的国界。在我们两国之间，有着长达一千公里左右的交接地带。这种天然的地理条件，使我们两国人民自古以来就密切交往，和睦相处。正如胡志明主席所说的：“我们越中两民族，数千年来血统相通，文化相同，在历史上素称兄弟之邦，加之国土接壤、地区毗连，更属唇齿相依，互为屏障。”
    根据考古的材料，我们可以知道，远在五千多年以前，中国和越南的文化就有不少共同之处。越南北部所发现的石器，和我国四川所发现的石器，几乎是完全相同的。再晚一些，越南北部清化发掘出来的青铜器，和中国战国、秦、汉时代的遗物也很相似。中国和越南的历史，也早就记载了中越两国之间互相交往的关系。十世纪时越南北部建立独立国家，以后虽更换了几次王朝，但都同中国通好。
    中越两国人民之间的相互往来移居，秦汉以后在历史上屡见不鲜。历史上中国人移居越南最多的一次是在一六七九年。当时明朝广东的龙门（钦县）总兵杨彦迪、副将进高，高雷廉总兵陈上川、副将陈安平等因为“义不事清”，曾率领三千余人，船五十余艘，出奔安南，航至土伦，受到安南政府的欢迎。他们后来就去开辟当时安南未暇经营的南方地区，即此后的嘉定、定祥、边和一带。他们在那里辛勤垦植，安居乐业，使这一带成为中国、日本、爪哇及西洋各国商船辐凑之地。嘉定府后来发展成为越南南部最兴盛的商业城市——西贡。
    越南人前来我国居住、经商或工作的，也有不少记载。北宋时交趾人和占城国人常常举族（有时
  一次达数百人之多）前来我国，侨居于广州、郴州和海南岛等地。明成祖经营北京城时，越南人阮安就曾参与设计工作，他还帮助了中国人民治河，作了不小的贡献。
    中越两国在经济和贸易上的联系是很早以前就开始了的。在公历纪元前约二百年，我国民间和越南已有贸易往来。我国以“金、铁、田器、马、牛、羊”和“缯帛”换回越南的“犀角、象齿、翡翠、珠玑”等物。到了宋代，越南向中国输出的有玳瑁、犀角、象牙、香料、槟榔、豆蔻等南海各地的产品，从中国输入的有纸、笔、草席、凉伞、绢扇、漆器、磁器、铅、锡等以及书籍。在生产知识和生产技术的交流方面，也有不少事实。春秋战国时代，两国人民交流了镕铜的经验。公元一世纪时，越南北部有些地方的人民还以狩猎为生，当时九真太守任延向越南人介绍了中国农业生产的方法，诸如铸制农具，开垦荒地等，使得他们从狩猎转入耕作。越南占城的稻种在宋代开始传入中国。公元一○一二年，宋真宗因为江淮两浙等地的水田稍有旱灾就致歉收，于是把已经在福建栽种的越南占城稻种三万斛，分给江南、淮南、两浙等地推广栽种。由于占城稻米比中国稻穗长而无芒，富于抗旱能力，且能不择地而生，因此就在当时的江淮两浙一带，后来也在河南地方得到推广。
    中越两国的文化关系渊源深远，很早以来就互相交流，互相影响。据传我国汉字早在公元前一百年左右就开始传入越南，并在越南广泛通行。十四世纪时，越南人以汉字为基础，参照中国六书造字方法，创造“字喃”（即越南文字）。越南十九世纪的伟大诗人阮攸所写的“金云翘传”六八体长诗，就是用“字喃”写成的，至今犹为越南人民有口皆碑的伟大古典作品。不过这种文字有着和汉字同样的缺点，书体繁复，音义兼用，所以又必须进行文字改革。只有推行了拉丁化的现行新文字，越南人民才把文化大大推进了一步。除了文字方面的共同历史渊源，我国不朽的古典文学作品，如红楼梦、水浒、三国演义和西游记等，也被译为越南文字，在越南流传很广，受到越南人民的喜爱。越南戏剧中的服装、音乐、演出方式等，同我国旧剧有很多相通之处。
    在中越两国关系史上更其值得珍贵的，是两国人民自近代以来，曾经不止一次地并肩反抗共同的敌人——帝国主义的侵略。在十九世纪七十年代，法国殖民者武装侵入越南，越南人民掀起了反抗侵略的斗争。在这一斗争中，中国人民曾经给予了有力的支援。据历史的记载，一八七三年法将安邺侵占河内，我国农民武装黑旗军，和越南人民并肩作战，大败法军；一八八三年春，在河内附近的纸桥激战，又重创法军。在一八八五年的中法战争中，黑旗军联合越南义勇队，在临洮截击敌人，获得大胜，沉重地打击了法国殖民者。直到十九世纪末期和二十世纪初期，越南农民在越南民族英雄黄花探等领导下，和法国殖民军队进行了将近二十年的艰苦的游击战争，很多遗留下来的黑旗军还继续同越南农民共同作战，抗击法军。
    本世纪以来，中越两国人民在争取民族独立的解放斗争中，一直是互相同情，互相支持的。我国的辛亥革命、五四运动、五卅运动和第一次国内革命战争，曾给越南人民以巨大的影响和鼓舞。同时，越南人民对中国人民的反帝反封建革命运动也寄予热情的同情和支持。孙中山先生在辛亥革命时期到越南活动的时候，曾得到了越南人民和在越南的华侨的有力支持。在第一次国内革命战争中，越南西贡兵工厂的工人曾以罢工的方式来声援我国人民的斗争。在抗日战争时期，中国的海岸遭到日本侵略者的封锁。越南人民曾经把抗日军事物资从海防经滇越铁路运往中国境内。一九四○年九月，当日本登陆越北时，越南人民在北山举行起义，实际上这也就阻挠了日本军队用越北作为军事根据地向中国西南的进攻。
    第二次世界大战后，中国人民怀着兴奋的心情迎接了越南八月革命取得胜利和越南民主共和国成立的喜讯。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，中越两国人民的友好关系进入了新的阶段。一九五○年一月十八日，中越两国正式建立了外交关系。自此以后，两国人民在保卫亚洲和世界和平、反抗美帝国主义侵略阴谋的共同斗争中，团结得更加紧密无间。同时，两国的经济和文化关系也日益加强。毫无疑问，这次以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国代表团的访问我国，必定将使中越两国人民之间的兄弟般的互助合作和友好关系更加巩固和发展。
