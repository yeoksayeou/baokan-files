Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 9th: TASS reports that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party opened on the 7th. At the morning session on the 7th, Laurent Casanova, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party Central Committee, gave a report on the development of the struggle for peace. He pointed out the changes in the balance of power between war and peace forces in the international situation. He pointed out that the people place great hopes on the upcoming Four-Power Conference in Geneva.

He said that the trend of easing international tensions is primarily because the imperialists, in view of the pressure from the people, dare not launch a war. This force of public opinion has a great influence on international politics. This fact proves that the democratic forces have made considerable progress.

The speaker refuted the bourgeois propaganda that the security of Europe can be achieved by strengthening two opposing military blocs. Casanova then pointed out that the supporters of the "policy of strength" hope for the failure of the Geneva conference, but the people of all countries believe that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement on many issues. In this situation, France should play its role in easing international tensions. He called on French public opinion to influence the government, urging it to adopt an independent position on the following issues at the upcoming Geneva conference: banning atomic weapons and disarmament, peaceful settlement of the German question, European security and cooperation, strict implementation of the Geneva Accords on Indochina, recognition of the People's Republic of China and its admission to the United Nations, and resolution of the Taiwan issue.

Casanova finally emphasized that fulfilling all these tasks is entirely in line with France's interests and the French people's desire for peace.

At the evening session on the 7th, Marcel Servin, secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, gave a report on building a united front of the working class and safeguarding the demands of the working people. Servin's report exposed the anti-scientific arguments of bourgeois theorists who deny the absolute impoverishment of the French working class and used concrete examples to illustrate the great material poverty suffered by the French working class. This situation has prompted the working masses to wage strike struggles to improve their lives. He pointed out that the will to struggle of the French working class has been greatly strengthened recently.

Servin pointed out that, regardless of the opposition from right-wing trade union leaders and leaders of the French Socialist Party, the working people are increasingly expanding their unity of action in the course of struggle. The French Communist Party plays a major role in establishing unity of action, and the French Communist Party's policy of unity of action is supported by an increasingly broad range of working people.

The speaker pointed out that in order to deal with this situation, French bourgeois representatives Mendes-France and Guy Mollet put forward the proposal to establish a so-called "new left wing." This is actually to establish an alliance against the Communist Party and to split the working class.

The speaker pointed out that the French Communist Party is prepared to sincerely cooperate with various social strata in order to promote a democratic policy of peace and progress. The unity of action between Communists and Socialists is developing in cities and villages across the country, which is essential for safeguarding the demands of the working class, for implementing a policy of peace and disarmament, for promoting the success of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, for stopping the implementation of colonial policies in Algeria, and for abolishing the state of emergency law. In every factory and every rural area, building unity of action is possible and necessary. The task of all party organizations and all party members is to strive to establish this unity.

The plenary session on the 8th began to discuss the reports of Casanova and Servin. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez attended the plenary session.

　　法国共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议七日开幕。在七日上午会议上，法国共产党中央政治局委员洛朗·加桑诺瓦作了关于争取和平的斗争发展情况的报告。他指出国际形势中战争与和平力量对比的变化。他指出，人民对即将在日内瓦举行的四国会议寄予极大的希望。
    他说，国际紧张局势缓和的趋势首先是因为帝国主义者鉴于人民的压力而不敢发动战争。这种舆论力量在国际政治中发生极大影响。这个事实证明了民主力量获得了相当大的进展。
    报告人驳斥了资产阶级宣传的所谓欧洲的安全可以由加强两个敌对军事集团而取得的论调。加桑诺瓦接着指出，“实力政策”拥护者希望日内瓦会议失败，但是各国人民认为在许多问题上有达成协议的可能性。在这种情况下，法国应当在缓和国际紧张局势的事业中起它的作用。他号召法国舆论对政府施以影响，促使它在即将举行的日内瓦会议上对下列问题采取独立的立场，这就是：禁止原子武器和裁军、和平解决德国问题、欧洲的安全和合作、严格执行关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定、承认中华人民共和国并让它进入联合国和解决台湾问题。
    加桑诺瓦最后着重说，执行所有这些任务，是完全符合法国的利益和法国人民对和平的愿望的。
    在七日晚间会议上，法国共产党中央委员会书记马赛尔·赛尔文作了关于建立工人阶级的统一战线和保障劳动人民的要求的报告。赛尔文的报告揭露了资产阶级理论家否认法国工人阶级的绝对贫困化的反科学论调，并且用具体的事例说明了法国工人阶级所受到的极大的物质贫困。这种情况促使劳动群众为争取改善生活而进行罢工斗争。他指出，最近法国工人阶级的斗争意志是大大加强了。
    赛尔文指出，不顾右翼工会领导和法国社会党领袖的反对，劳动人民在斗争过程中日益扩大他们的行动一致。法国共产党在建立一致行动中起着重大的作用，法国共产党的一致行动的政策受到日益广泛的劳动人民的拥护。
    报告人指出，为了对付这种情况，法国资产阶级代表孟戴斯—弗朗斯和居伊·摩勒提出了建立所谓“新的左翼”的主张。这实际上是要建立反对共产党的联盟和使工人阶级分裂。
    报告人指出，法国共产党准备诚恳地同各个社会阶层进行合作，以便推行和平和进步的民主政策。共产党人和社会党人的行动一致正在全国各城市和乡村中发展起来，这对保障工人阶级的要求，对实行和平和裁军的政策，对促使四大国政府首脑会议成功，对停止在阿尔及利亚实行殖民政策，对取消紧急状态法都是十分必要的。在每个工厂里和每个农村里，建立行动一致是可能而且是必要的。所有党组织和全体党员的任务就是争取建立这种团结一致。
    八日全体会议开始讨论加桑诺瓦和赛尔文的报告。法国共产党总书记多列士参加了全体会议。
