To the Editor:
　　We are immigrants who moved from Beijing to Helan County, Yinchuan area, Gansu Province. Before we came here, we had many concerns, but after arriving in Yinchuan, all our worries completely disappeared. Now, we want to tell you the true situation we have seen with our own eyes, and through you, inform everyone who cares about us.
　　Yinchuan is truly a good place. This is a Yellow River alluvial plain with very fertile land, and there are large tracts of wasteland everywhere. According to the local people, these wastelands, once cultivated and sown with seeds, will grow very good crops without fertilization. The weather here is relatively mild, and although it does not rain often, there are crisscrossing canals, making the water conservancy conditions very superior. The Yinchuan area began to draw water from the Yellow River to irrigate the fields two thousand years ago. Now there are thirty-one large main canals such as Tanglai, Hanyan, Huinong, and Qin Canal, and small canals are everywhere, making irrigation very convenient. Here, there is neither drought nor flood. A local folk song says: "Ningxia Plain, pointed at both ends, leaning on the Yellow River to the east and the Helan Mountains to the west, not afraid of rain or drought, as long as you can work, you won't go hungry, blame fate, not heaven." This shows that the natural conditions in the Yinchuan area are excellent. In recent years, the farmers here have had bumper harvests. The highest yield of rice per mu is more than 1,000 jin, and wheat can also yield more than 700 jin. How can we not be happy to move to such a good place?
　　When we came, the staff of the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau accompanied us all the way to our destination. We took a train from Beijing to Baotou, and then took a car from Baotou to Helan. There were reception stations along the way, and the care was very thoughtful. After we arrived here, the local people warmly welcomed us. The responsible comrades of the Yinchuan Special Zone and Helan County Party and government also came from afar to express their condolences. We were truly grateful beyond words. Before we arrived, the government had prepared houses and daily necessities for us. Rows of spacious houses, all with glass windows. Every family was given a set of all necessary daily necessities, such as pots, bowls, basins, knives, etc., and the oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, coal, and kerosene for monthly consumption were also distributed by the public. The government will provide us with living expenses for one year until we can cultivate the wasteland and become self-sufficient. Before we set off from Beijing, we had a major concern in our minds, which was the fear that we would not be able to catch up with the planting season if we came here to open up wasteland temporarily. However, we never expected that the local government had already mobilized the masses to open up more than 4,000 mu of wasteland for us, and also dug a canal and planted more than 2,000 mu of rice, as well as many beans, sweet potatoes, flax, etc. Now, the green crops that stretch as far as the eye can see have grown very tall. We have many newly purchased horses, mules, cattle, carts, and new-style farm implements, all of which belong to our collective. In addition, the government has also taken care of some things that we did not expect. The Helan County People's Hospital has specially sent two medical personnel to live here for a long time to treat us. This medical room has general medicines and equipment, and can be diagnosed and treated at any time, day or night, when there is illness. The Helan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also set up a sales station here, where we can buy all our daily necessities. We will never forget the government's care and consideration for us.
　　The local people are also very enthusiastic to us. In addition to helping us build houses and open up wasteland, they also introduced us in detail to the local customs and some issues related to planting crops. Farmers nearby, even elderly grandmothers, came to see us and asked if we had any difficulties. Some people were afraid that we would not be able to eat green vegetables, so they brought vegetables, eggs, etc. from far away. We get along very well with the local people, and we don't feel strange or estranged at all.
　　Most of us have lived in cities for a long time and have not engaged in agricultural production. But we will definitely live up to the government's expectations. We know that the country needs grain very much during the economic construction period, but there is a lot of fertile land here waiting for people to cultivate. We will definitely work hard to learn agricultural farming techniques, settle down in agricultural production, and cultivate all the vast wasteland here, increase more grain for the country, and support the country's socialist construction.

### 北京移民谈西北银川的生活情况

　　北京移民谈西北银川的生活情况编辑同志：
    我们是从北京市迁到甘肃省银川地区贺兰县的移民。没有到这里的时候，我们是有许多顾虑的，可是，来到银川以后一切顾虑就完全消除了。现在，我们把亲眼看见的真实情况告诉你们，通过你们告诉一切关怀我们的人。
    银川真是个好地方。这是一片黄河冲积平原，土地非常肥沃，到处都有大块荒地，据当地群众谈，这些荒地开垦以后播上种子不用施肥就会长出很好的庄稼。这里天气比较温和，虽然不常下雨，但是河渠纵横，水利条件非常优越。二千年以前银川地区就开始引黄河的水灌溉田地，现在有唐徕、汉延、惠农、秦渠等三十一条大的干渠，小的渠道到处都是，灌溉非常方便。这里，既不受旱灾，也不会遭水灾，当地农民有一首歌谣说：“宁夏川，两头尖，东靠黄河西靠贺兰山，不怕下雨不怕旱，只要能劳动不怕吃不上饭，饿死怨人不怨天。”这说明银川地区的自然条件是再好不过了。几年来，这里的农民都获得了丰收，每亩水稻最高有产一千多斤的，麦子也能产七百多斤。我们迁移到这样好的地方，心里怎能不高兴呢？
    我们来的时候，北京市民政局的工作人员一直送我们到达目的地。我们从北京坐火车到包头，又从包头乘汽车到贺兰，沿途有接待站，照顾很周到。我们到这里以后，当地的群众热烈地欢迎我们，银川专区和贺兰县的党和政府的负责人也远道赶来慰问我们，我们心里真是说不出的感激。在我们没有来的时候，政府就替我们准备了房子和生活上必需的用具。一排一排宽大的房子，都是玻璃窗子。一切生活上必需的用具，如锅、碗、盆、刀等等，每家都分得一套，每月吃的油、盐、酱、醋和用的煤、灯油等也由公家分给，吃的粮食有大米、白面和黄米。政府将供应我们一年的生活用费，直到我们开垦荒地生产能自给为止。我们在北京动身到这里来以前，思想有一个很大的顾虑，就是怕来这里临时开荒赶不上播种的季节了。可是，真没想到当地政府早就发动群众为我们开垦了四千多亩荒地，并且开了一道渠，种了二千多亩稻子，还种了许多豆子、山芋、葫麻等。现在那一眼望不到边的绿油油的庄稼已经长得很高了。我们这里有许多新买的马、骡、牛和大车、新式农具等，这些都属于我们集体所有。另外，有些我们没有想到的事情，政府也都办好了。贺兰县人民卫生院专门派了两位医务人员长期住在这里为我们看病，这个医疗室里一般的药品和设备都有，不管白天黑夜有了病随时可以诊治。贺兰县供销合作社也在这里设立了推销站，我们一切生活上的用品都可以买到。政府对我们的关怀和照顾，我们永远也不会忘记的。
    当地群众对我们也很热情。他们除了帮助我们修建房子、开垦荒地外，还详尽地向我们介绍这里的风俗人情和种植农作物的一些问题。附近的农民，甚至连上了年纪的老大娘也都跑来看我们，问我们有什么困难。有些人惟恐我们吃不上青菜，从很远的地方送来蔬菜、鸡子等。我们和当地群众相处得很好，一点也不感到生疏和隔阂。
    我们这些人大部分都是长期生活在城市里，没有作过农业生产。但是我们一定不会辜负政府对我们的希望。我们知道国家在经济建设时期非常需要粮食，这里却有许多肥沃的土地等待人们来开垦。我们一定努力学习农业耕作技术，安心农业生产，把这里广阔的荒地都开垦出来，为国家增产更多的粮食，支援国家的社会主义建设。
