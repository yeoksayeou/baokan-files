　　Nepotism Undermines National Regulations
　　To the Editor:
　　According to national regulations, workers' and peasants' secondary schools should enroll people of worker and peasant origin who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years. However, the workers' and peasants' secondary school attached to our Beijing Institute of Technology has admitted a rural youth named Zhang Shusheng, who has never participated in work, to study at our school as an auditor for two years. This auditor was introduced through the personal connections of his uncle, Cui Yueli, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
　　Although we have repeatedly raised objections to the school leaders, the answer we received was: "He's already here, it would be embarrassing to send him away now. Let's wait until he graduates!" Is it permissible to violate national regulations for the sake of "face"? Therefore, we are very dissatisfied with the school leadership's behavior of only considering personal relationships and not acting in accordance with regulations, because this kind of decadent personal relationship is incompatible with the moral atmosphere of our society.

### 不允许利用私人关系破坏国家规定

　　不允许利用私人关系破坏国家规定编辑同志：
    按照国家规定，工农速成中学应该吸收参加革命工作三年以上的工农成份的人入学，但是我们北京工业学院附设工农速成中学却吸收了一个从来没有参加过工作的农村青年张树声以旁听生的名义在我们学校里学习了两年。这位旁听生是通过他叔父中共北京市委会统一战线工作部副部长崔月犁的私人关系介绍来的。
    我们虽然多次向学校负责人提过意见。但回答我们的是：“已经来了，再叫走，面子上不好看。等他毕业以后再说吧！”难道为了“面子”就可以违反国家的规定吗？因此，我们对学校领导方面只顾私人关系，不按规定办事的行为很不满意，因为这种腐朽的私人关系是同我们社会的道德风气不相容的。　北京工业学院附设工农速成中学学生
