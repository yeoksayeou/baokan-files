At 7:00 AM, President Ho Chi Minh, General Secretary Truong Chinh, and other members of the government delegation, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the People's Army Vo Nguyen Giap, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the entire venue resounded with warm applause and slogans.

Leaders of government departments, the army, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, heroic models, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials, also attended the meeting.

The meeting began under the chairmanship of Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front. Ton Duc Thang pointed out that the Vietnamese people welcomed this visit of great historical significance with joy and excitement, and welcomed and thanked the government delegation led by President Ho for successfully completing its mission.

Subsequently, President Ho Chi Minh delivered a report at the meeting on the visit of the Vietnamese government delegation to the Soviet Union and China.

President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: The purpose of the visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Soviet Union and China was: 1. To consolidate the unity and friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of the Soviet Union and China; 2. To develop economic and cultural relations between Vietnam and these two friendly countries.

President Ho Chi Minh said: "Our delegation met with the government leaders of these two friendly countries and discussed with them the situation in Southeast Asia and the world, measures to defend peace, and the work to be carried out to restore and develop our country's economic and cultural life. Our delegation has reached a complete consensus with the leaders of these two friendly countries."

President Ho Chi Minh also said: "The people and governments of these two friendly countries have expressed very close and very deep friendship to us, and have expressed very warm and very active sympathy and support." He then described the assistance given to the Vietnamese people by the friendly countries.

President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "Our country is a member of the large family of democratic and socialist countries with a population of over 900 million. We have experienced eight or nine years of arduous and heroic resistance. Now, peace has been rebuilt, but peace is not yet consolidated, and the American imperialists are trying to divide our country forever. Under such circumstances, we must maintain a high degree of fighting spirit and vigilance. We must unite closely from North to South, resolutely carry out the struggle, and overcome all difficulties in order to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords."

President Ho Chi Minh concluded: "Thanks to the assistance of friendly countries, we feel that we are stronger in the struggle to consolidate peace, strive for unification through free general elections, and strive for the complete independence and democracy of the entire country."

    新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国首都河内各界人民五万多人在二十三日上午举行大会，庆祝胡志明主席和他率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问中国、苏联后胜利归来。
    上午七时，胡志明主席、长征总书记和政府代表团的其他团员，以及副总理范文同、国防部长兼人民军总司令武元甲等登上主席台。这时，全场响起了热烈的掌声和口号。
    政府各部门、军队、各民主党派和人民团体的负责人，英雄模范们，以及各国外交使节和外交官员也都参加了大会。
    大会在越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席孙德胜的主持下开始。孙德胜指出，越南人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情欢迎这一有伟大历史意义的访问，欢迎和感谢胡主席所率领的政府代表团胜利完成任务。
    接着，胡志明主席在大会上作了关于越南政府代表团访问苏联和中国的报告。
    胡志明主席指出：越南民主共和国政府代表团访问苏联和中国的目的是：一、巩固越南人民同苏联和中国两国人民之间的团结和友谊；二、发展越南同这两个友好国家之间的经济和文化关系。
    胡志明主席说：“我国代表团会见了这两个友好国家的政府领袖们，并且同他们讨论了东南亚和世界的局势、保卫和平的措施和为恢复和发展我国的经济和文化生活所要进行的工作。我国代表团同这两个友好国家的领袖们已经取得完全一致的意见。”
