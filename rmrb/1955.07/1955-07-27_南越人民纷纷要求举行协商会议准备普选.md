Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 26th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the movement demanding a consultative conference to prepare for a general election is expanding daily in various parts of South Vietnam.

    In Saigon, Cholon, and other cities and rubber plantations in South Vietnam, people are widely expressing their demands for national unification, and that the responsible authorities in both North and South Vietnam hold a consultative conference, and guarantee the livelihood of the working people.
  The Ngo Dinh Diem regime responded to these demands with armed suppression. People's demonstrations in My Tho, Can Tho, Soc Trang, Tay Ninh, Bien Hoa and other provinces have been devastated by them. In central South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime mobilized a large number of troops to "mop up" the area in order to suppress the people's patriotic movement demanding a consultative conference.
    Residents of Binh Dinh Province and Thua Thien Province in central Vietnam also responded to the movement demanding a consultative conference. Residents of Phu Vinh area in Thua Thien Province held many gatherings for this purpose. The Ngo Dinh Diem government is carrying out suppression here. At the same time, they are forcing local people to sign petitions against the general election. But people firmly oppose doing so. Residents of a village in Phong Dien district, Thua Thien province, told Ngo Dinh Diem's henchmen bluntly: The unification of our country is our most sincere wish. A consultative conference must be held to prepare for a general election to unify the country.

    南越人民纷纷要求举行协商会议准备普选
    新华社河内二十六日讯　据越南通讯社报道：要求举行协商会议准备普选的运动，在越南南方各地日益扩大。
    在西贡、堤岸以及越南南方其他城市和橡胶园里，人们广泛地表示要求全国统一，并且要求越南南北双方负责当局举行协商会议，以及保证劳动人民的生活。
  吴庭艳政权用武装镇压来回答这些要求。美荻、芹苴、沙沥、西宁、边和等省的人民示威都遭到了他们的摧残。在中越南部，吴庭艳政权为了镇压人民要求举行协商会议的爱国运动，动员了大批军队去“扫荡”这一地区。
    中越平定省、承天省的居民也响应了要求举行协商会议的运动。承天省富荣地方的居民为此举行了许多次集会。吴庭艳政府在这里一面进行镇压，同时，还强迫当地人民签名反对普选。但是人们坚决反对这样做。承天省丰田县一个村庄的居民对吴庭艳的爪牙直率地说：我国的统一是我们大家最亲切的愿望。一定要举行协商会议以准备统一国家的普选。
