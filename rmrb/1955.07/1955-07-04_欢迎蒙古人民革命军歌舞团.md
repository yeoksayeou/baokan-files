　　Welcome the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army
　　Duan Suquan
    We extend a warm welcome to the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, led by Major General Damdinhuu, on their visit to our country. The people of China and Mongolia share a long and profound friendship. This brotherly friendship has played and continues to play an extremely important role in overthrowing domestic feudal forces, jointly resisting and ultimately defeating the aggression of Japanese imperialism, jointly building a happy and prosperous socialist society, and safeguarding world peace.

    As everyone knows, the Mongolian people are not only known for their diligence, simplicity, riding skills, and bravery, but also have a long history and culture. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the late Comrade Sukhe Bator and Marshal Choibalsan, since the victory of the revolution in 1921, the Mongolian people have achieved great gains in political, economic, and cultural construction over the past thirty-four years. On such a solid social foundation, the armed forces of the Mongolian people—the People's Revolutionary Army—have grown stronger and become an invincible force. In 1935, it victoriously resisted the perfidious and barbaric attacks of Japanese imperialism on the Mongolian border in the Baikal Lake area. In the summer of 1939, it fought alongside the Soviet army in the Khalkhin Gol area and successfully crushed the invasion of the Japanese invading army, which possessed 90,000 soldiers and officers, hundreds of tanks, hundreds of aircraft, and a large number of artillery pieces. After days of fierce fighting, the entire Japanese army group was annihilated. This forced the Japanese warlords to retreat again, and on July 9, 1940, the Mongolian-Manchu border agreement was concluded in Moscow, and the Mongolian People's Republic recovered the territories previously occupied by Japan and the puppet Manchukuo.

    On May 8, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally, and the only obstacle on the road to a complete cessation of bloody war was Japanese imperialism, which refused to surrender and continued to resist militarily. Loyal to its allied obligations and eager to quickly stop the war and restore world peace, the Soviet government notified the Japanese government on August 8, 1945, that the Soviet government would be at war with Japan from August 9. The Mongolian People's Republic also declared war on Japan on August 10, 1945. The Mongolian people joined the ranks of the various peoples of the Soviet Union and fought with them against the most cunning and ferocious enemy. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, mainly composed of cavalry mechanized units, under the command of its supreme commander Marshal Choibalsan, took charge of the right wing of the forces commanded by Soviet Marshal Malinovsky. In close coordination with the Soviet army, it overcame great difficulties, carrying water and feed for people and horses, passed through the Gobi Desert, advanced 40 to 50 kilometers day and night in the war, destroyed enemy resistance, and coordinated with the Eighth Route Army of our country, which persisted in fighting behind enemy lines in the Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan areas, to liberate the vast area north of the Great Wall in Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, cutting off the retreat route of the Japanese invaders from the puppet Manchukuo to North China, and achieved extremely brilliant results.

    The victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution and every achievement in socialist construction have always been a great encouragement to the Chinese people, especially to the broad masses of people who persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle behind enemy lines. Of course, based on the righteousness of our own struggle, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we would inevitably guide the struggle to final victory; but at the same time, we also deeply realized the great role of the immensely powerful Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic in helping our country.

    Shortly after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945, the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces crushed the Japanese army's elite Kwantung Army with overwhelming force, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army fought alongside the Soviet Union, overcoming the stubborn resistance of the Japanese army along the way, and advanced rapidly to the area north of the Great Wall in Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. When the troops advanced to the area south of Duolun County, Chahar Province, on August 17, they first met with the Chahar North Guerrilla Cavalry Detachment of our Eighth Route Army, which had persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle on the Chahar North grasslands for many years. This was a meeting of righteous people! At that time, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's telegram congratulating the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces on their victory in the war against Japan aroused warm cheers.

    On August 20, 1945, the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese invaders at Laohugou (the Great Wall pass north of Zhangjiakou), which had a direct impact on our army's liberation of Zhangjiakou City on August 25.

    Although we spent a short time with the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, we still vividly remember their harmony between officers and soldiers, the internal unity and friendship of the army, the officers' tireless spirit of learning, their respect and care for the interests of the working people, and their sincere friendship with the Eighth Route Army.

    Not long after, the Soviet Union faithfully fulfilled its promise. After completing the task of disarming the Japanese army in Manchuria and withdrawing the Japanese army from the area, the Soviet army began to withdraw. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army also withdrew from the area north of the Great Wall in Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Since then, as the comrades of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army said in their farewell message, the Chinese People's Liberation Army experienced an extremely arduous struggle, and finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, defeated the millions of Kuomintang reactionaries armed to the teeth by American imperialism, won a historic and great victory, and established the People's Republic of China. From then on, the relationship between our two peoples further developed on a new basis.

    On the occasion of the visit and performance of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army to China, we once again express our heartfelt respect to the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army for its outstanding contributions to the struggle to overthrow feudal forces and resist the aggression of Japanese imperialists!

　　欢迎蒙古人民革命军歌舞团
　　段苏权
    应邀来我国访问的以达姆丁胡少将为首的蒙古人民革命军歌舞团来到北京，我们表示热烈的欢迎。中蒙两国人民具有长期的深厚的友谊，这种兄弟般的友谊，在推翻国内的封建势力和共同抵抗以及最后战胜日本帝国主义的侵略的斗争中；在共同建设美满幸福的社会主义社会以及维护世界和平的事业上，发挥了而且还在发挥着极为重大的作用。
    大家知道，蒙古人民不仅以勤劳、纯朴、善骑骁勇著称，而且具有悠久的历史和文化。在蒙古人民革命党和已故的苏赫·巴托尔同志及乔巴山元帅领导下，于一九二一年取得革命的胜利以后，三十四年来蒙古人民在政治、经济、文化各方面的建设上，都取得了巨大的收获。在这样坚实的社会基础上，蒙古人民的武装力量——人民革命军更加壮大和发展，成为一支不可被战胜的力量。它于一九三五年在贝加尔湖一带胜利地抵抗了日本帝国主义在蒙古边境的背信的野蛮进攻，而于一九三九年夏，在哈勒欣格河一带和苏联军队并肩作战，顺利地粉碎了拥有九万士兵和军官、几百辆坦克、几百架飞机和大量大炮的日本侵略军的侵袭，经过多日激战之后，终将日本军团全部歼灭。这就迫使日本军阀不得不再度退却，于一九四○年七月九日在莫斯科缔结蒙满边境协定，蒙古人民共和国收复了先前被日本和伪满侵占去的领土。
    一九四五年五月八日，法西斯德国无条件投降，全面停止流血战争的道路上的唯一障碍，只是日本帝国主义，它拒绝投降而继续作军事抵抗。忠于自己的同盟国义务，并热望迅速停止战争和恢复世界和平的苏联政府，于一九四五年八月八日通知日本政府：苏联政府从八月九日起跟日本处于战争状态。一九四五年八月十日蒙古人民共和国也向日本宣战。蒙古人民参加了苏联各族人民的队伍，跟他们一起反对最奸诈、最凶恶的敌人。蒙古人民革命军主要是由骑兵机械化部队所组成的，在其最高统帅乔巴山元帅统率下，担当了苏联元帅马林柯夫斯基所指挥的部队的右翼，在和苏军紧密的协同下，克服了极大的困难，携带了人和马喝的水和马料，通过了大戈壁，在战争中一昼夜前进四、五十公里，摧毁敌人的抵抗，协同在热、察、绥地区坚持敌后斗争的我国八路军，解放了热河、察哈尔和绥远境内长城以北的广大地区，切断了日寇从伪满到华北的退路，取得了极为辉煌的战绩。
    蒙古人民革命的胜利以及社会主义建设的每一成就，对于中国人民一向是莫大的鼓舞，特别是对深入敌后坚持抗日斗争的广大人民，更加深切。当然，基于我们自己的斗争的正义性，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，我们必然会把斗争引导到最后的胜利；但同时我们也深深地认识到强大无比的苏联和蒙古人民共和国对我国的帮助的重大作用。
    一九四五年八月八日苏联对日宣战后不久，苏蒙联军以排山倒海之势，击溃了日寇精锐的关东军，迫使日本无条件投降。而蒙古人民革命军和苏联并肩作战，沿途克服日军顽强抵抗，神速地向热、察、绥长城以北地区进军。当部队于八月十七日进至察哈尔省多伦县以南地区时，首先和多年在察北草原坚持抗日斗争的我国八路军察北游击骑兵支队会师。这是正义的人民的会师！当时朱总司令祝贺苏蒙联军对日战争胜利的电报，更引起了热烈的欢呼。
    一九四五年八月二十日，苏蒙联军在老虎沟（张家口以北的长城口）和日寇进行搏战，这对我军八月二十五日解放张家口市是有其直接影响的。
    我们和蒙古人民革命军相处时间虽短，但对于他们官兵间的融洽、军队内部的团结友爱、军官孜孜不倦的学习精神、对劳动人民利益的尊重和爱护，以及对八路军的诚挚友谊等等，至今记忆犹新。
    过后不久，苏联忠实地履行自己的诺言，苏军在完成解除满洲日军武装并自该地撤退日军的任务后，开始撤退。而蒙古人民革命军也从热、察、绥长城以北地区撤退。此后，正像蒙古人民革命军同志临别赠言所说的一样，中国人民解放军经历了一段极为艰苦的斗争道路，终于在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导之下，战胜了美帝国主义所全副武装起来的数百万国民党反动派军队，取得了历史性的伟大胜利，成立了中华人民共和国。从此，我们两国人民的关系在新的基础上进一步发展起来。
    在蒙古人民革命军歌舞团这次到中国访问和表演的时候，我们再一次对蒙古人民革命军在推翻封建势力和抵抗日本帝国主义侵略者的斗争中所作出的卓越贡献，表示衷心的敬意！
