    Good Cotton Yarn Should Not Be Used to Wipe Machines
    Editor:
    Our engineering section领 (lǐng - receive, get) received forty kilograms of "waste cotton yarn" for wiping machines from the Xuzhou Materials Factory in June. However, the waste cotton yarn allocated to us was actually continuous strands of finished raw material. This made it difficult for us to handle. Initially, we thought the Materials Factory had made a mistake, so we called to inquire. The comrade who answered the phone said, "This cotton yarn was allocated from the Jinan Materials Factory and is intended for wiping machines." When we distributed this good, fine yarn to the work areas, the workers raised many objections. They felt it was a waste to use such clean, white fine yarn as waste material for wiping oil. We accepted the workers' opinions and put the cotton yarn into the warehouse.
    We request the Party newspaper to strictly criticize those individuals and units who waste national wealth, so that they recognize that wasting national wealth is a shameful thing.

### 不该用好棉纱擦机器

    不该用好棉纱擦机器编辑同志：
    我们工务段在六月份向徐州材料厂领擦机器用的“废棉纱”四十公斤。但拨来的废棉纱却是一丝不断的成品原料，使我们很难处理，开始，我们以为材料厂发错了，于是打电话去问，接电话的同志说：“这些棉纱是济南材料厂拨来，就是擦机器用的。”当我们把这些好细纱发给工区使用时，工人们提出很多意见。他们认为用这样洁白的细纱，当废料来擦油，真是浪费。我们接受工人们的意见，就把这些棉纱放进了仓库。
    我们要求党报给那些浪费国家财富的个人和单位以严格批评，使他们认识到浪费国家财富是一种可耻的事情。
