Strengthen the Struggle to Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Elements
National People's Congress Representative Huang Changshui

This time, I, along with representatives Lei Jieqiong, Guangdong Provincial People's Representatives, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and provincial CPPCC members, a group of ten, went to the Yuexi area for inspection, lasting two weeks, inspecting the three counties and one city of Taishan, Dianbai, Kaiping, and Zhanjiang.

Through this inspection, I gained some understanding of the situation, listened to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and further clarified the advantages and disadvantages of our work and the direction of our future efforts to improve our work.

One of the most profound impressions I gained during this inspection was learning about the activities of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and remnant counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the country in the Yuexi area, as well as how the government and the people suppress counter-revolutionary elements.

In the entire Yuexi area, counter-revolutionary activities by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, landlords, rich peasants, and reactionary capitalists, such as disrupting public order, sabotaging production, killing cadres, and spreading rumors during disasters, are quite serious. The nature of their activities can be roughly divided into the following categories:

First, cases of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and counter-revolutionary elements dispatched from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and abroad. The main activities of these secret agents are stealing military and political intelligence, etc. More than 100 cases have been uncovered in the past year. Among them, the three bridge-burning incidents discovered in Maoming, Kaiping, Enping and other places are relatively prominent; the attempted bombing of factories and warehouses in Zhanjiang was unsuccessful; a counter-revolutionary element who infiltrated our administrative organization killed our Deputy Director of the Grain Bureau, planning staff, and a communications officer; and six abandoned empty boats of counter-revolutionary elements who sneaked into the mainland from Taiwan were discovered along the coast of Yuexi.

Second, cases of remnant counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the country. The perpetrators are counter-revolutionary elements who escaped during the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, as well as those who have served their sentences or been released early. The activities of these counter-revolutionary elements are mainly manifested in developing various counter-revolutionary underground organizations. Their methods are:

1.  First, they collude with each other and establish contact with secret agents in Hong Kong and Macau, attempting to assassinate our leading staff.
2.  They sabotage the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement by spreading rumors, inciting disturbances, and arson. For example, counter-revolutionary elements in the sixth district of Haikang County spread rumors that there was "immortal water" in a certain place that could cure all diseases. After the rumors spread, people from nearby counties and even Guangxi and Hainan Island came to take "immortal water" to drink. As a result, more than 100 people died from drinking "immortal water" because of illness, and more than 500 people became ill from drinking "immortal water." Counter-revolutionary elements in Taishan County set fires while farmers were attending mobilization meetings for expanding cooperatives, attempting to sabotage the agricultural cooperativization movement.

In addition, there are also destructive activities such as sabotaging power lines, posting reactionary slogans, and poisoning.

The reasons for the above serious situation are as follows:

First, because we are determined to liberate Taiwan, and because of the increasing progress of our socialist construction and socialist transformation, the enemy is not reconciled to its failure. The enemies abroad are stepping up their efforts to send secret agents to the mainland to engage in activities. In addition, the Guangdong area is close to Hong Kong and Macau, and the coastline of the Yuexi area is more than 2,300 li, which also facilitates the enemy's infiltration; the class enemies who have been eliminated and will be eliminated in the country are intensifying their resistance. In addition, Yuexi has suffered relatively serious disasters in recent years, and our work in unified purchase and sales has some shortcomings, which has given the enemy opportunities to carry out sabotage.

Second, cadres are complacent with the victories they have achieved in the past and have a blindly optimistic and negligent attitude, so they do not fully recognize the madness of the enemy's sabotage and lack a strong concept of fighting the enemy. Our administrative leaders at all levels have also not done enough to educate cadres on fighting the enemy.

Third, there is a right-leaning tendency in the implementation of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Emphasizing that we should not arrest or kill the wrong people is of course correct; but some of our cadres have developed a tendency to shrink back due to fear of arresting or killing the wrong people, turning into not arresting those who should be arrested and releasing those who should not be released. The general situation is that fewer people are arrested and more are released, and sentences are lenient. On the other hand, from the second half of last year to the end of March this year, more than 100 of our cadres and masses were killed or injured by counter-revolutionary elements.

In addition, because some cadres did not implement the central government's principle of "stricter measures from now on," some counter-revolutionary criminals were only sentenced to one or two years in prison. Because these prisoners' sentences were short, they were not reformed well and were released home, and soon committed crimes again.

The situation of these counter-revolutionary activities in the Yuexi area has made me deeply aware of the necessity of strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements, and also of the great power of the people in fighting against counter-revolutionary elements. The cracking of many counter-revolutionary cases in the Yuexi area is due to the reports of local people and the government's close reliance on the people. In agricultural production cooperatives, mass anti-espionage and security organizations have mostly been established. Moreover, due to the improvement of the masses' political consciousness, the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements often cannot escape the eyes of the broad masses of the people. Once, counter-revolutionary elements planned to rob the weapons of the township government in our district and go up the mountains to make trouble, but the case was solved due to the reports of the masses. It can be seen that in the future we must further improve the political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the people and rely closely on the people. Only in this way can we achieve greater victories in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary elements.

In order to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, in order to ensure the victorious completion of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and in order to protect and develop agricultural production, I believe that one of the very important tasks before us is to raise our vigilance and strengthen the suppression of all counter-revolutionary elements. To this end, we must mobilize all the power of the masses to cooperate with national laws and public security organs to do a good job in protecting the country and protecting the long-term interests of the people. We must learn from the experience of fighting against all hidden counter-revolutionary elements from the publicity and education of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. When the broad masses of the people have improved their political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance, there is absolutely no room for any counter-revolutionary elements to engage in activities.

### 加强镇压反革命分子的斗争

    加强镇压反革命分子的斗争
    全国人民代表大会代表　黄长水
    我这次同雷洁琼代表、广东省人民代表、全国政协委员、省政协委员一行十人，到粤西区视察，前后历时两周，视察了台山、电白、开平、湛江三县一市。
    通过这次视察，在一定程度上了解了一些情况，倾听了群众的意见和批评，进一步明确了工作上的优缺点和今后改进工作的努力方向。
    在这次视察中使我比较具有深刻印象之一的，是了解到美蒋特务分子和潜伏在国内的残余反革命分子，在粤西地区的活动情况，以及政府和人民如何镇压反革命分子的情况：
    在整个粤西区，美蒋特务、地主、富农、反动的资本家等反革命分子，破坏治安、破坏生产、杀害干部、趁着灾荒散播谣言等反革命活动是相当严重的。他们活动的性质大体可分为下列几项：
    第一，由台湾、香港、澳门及国外派遣进来的美蒋特务反革命分子的案件。这些特务分子的活动，主要是偷窃军事、政治情报等，计一年来被我破获的有一百多件。其中比较突出的是在茂名、开平、恩平等地发现的三次烧桥事件；企图爆炸湛江工厂和仓库未遂事件；一个潜入我行政机构的反革命分子杀害了我粮食处副处长、计划科员、通讯员三人的事件；粤西沿海发现由台湾潜入内地的反革命分子遗弃空船六艘的事件等。
    第二，潜伏在国内的残余反革命分子案件。犯罪者都是土地改革、镇压反革命运动中漏网的及刑满或提前释放的反革命分子。这些反革命分子的活动，主要表现在发展各种各样的反革命地下组织。其活动方式是：
    一、首先串连起来，并同香港、澳门的特务取得联系，企图刺杀我领导工作人员。
    二、通过散播谣言、煽惑骚动和放火，破坏农业互助合作运动。例如海康县第六区反革命分子造谣说：某地有仙水，可医百病。谣言传出后，附近县份甚至广西、海南岛都有人来取“仙水”吃，结果因病吃“仙水”而死的有一百多人，因吃“仙水”而生病的有五百多人。台山县反革命分子趁农民参加扩社动员大会时放火，企图破坏农业合作化运动。
    此外，还有破坏电线、张贴反动标语、放毒等破坏活动。
    造成以上严重情况的原因有以下几方面：
    第一，由于我们一定要解放台湾，由于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益进展，敌人是不甘心于自己的失败的，在国外的敌人加紧派遣特务到内地来活动，加上广东地区接近香港、澳门，粤西区海岸线有二千三百多华里，这也便于敌人的潜入；国内已被消灭的和将被消灭的阶级敌人加紧反抗，加上年来粤西灾情较为严重，我们在统购统销工作中有某些缺点，就给了敌人进行破坏的机会。
    第二，干部陶醉于过去取得的胜利，存在着盲目乐观的轻敌麻痹情绪，因而对敌人破坏的疯狂性认识不足，对敌斗争观念不强，而我们的各级行政领导在干部中进行对敌斗争的教育也做得不够。
    第三，在执行镇压反革命政策上存在着右倾偏向。强调不要逮错杀错，这当然是正确的；但我们有些干部由于怕逮错杀错而发生缩手缩脚的偏向，变成应抓的不抓，不该放的却放了。一般情况是少抓多放，重刑轻判。但另一方面，从去年下半年到今年三月底，我们的干部和群众被反革命分子杀害、打伤的竟达一百多人。
    另外，由于有的干部没有贯彻中央指示“今后从严”的原则，有些反革命罪犯只判一、二年刑期，这些犯人因刑期短没有改造好，便被释放回家，不久便又犯罪了。
    粤西区这些反革命活动的情况，使我深深认识了加强镇压反革命分子的必要，也认识了人民群众对反革命分子进行斗争的伟大力量。粤西区许多反革命案件的破获，都是由于当地群众的检举和政府密切依靠人民的结果。在农业生产合作社，大多建立了群众性的防奸保卫组织。更由于群众政治觉悟的提高，反革命分子的阴谋活动常常是逃不过广大人民的眼睛的。有一次反革命分子打算抢劫我区乡政府的武器上山作乱，就由于群众的检举而破案。可见今后我们必须更进一步提高人民群众的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，密切依靠人民。只有这样，才能在镇压反革命分子的斗争中取得更大胜利。
    为了进一步巩固人民民主专政，为了保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利完成，为了保护和发展农业生产，我认为摆在我们眼前的十分重要的工作之一就是要提高警惕，加强镇压一切反革命分子。为此，我们就必须动员一切群众力量配合国家法律、治安机关来做好这一保卫国家、保护人民长远利益的工作。我们必须从肃清胡风反革命集团的宣传教育中，学习同一切暗藏的反革命分子作斗争的经验。在广大人民群众提高了政治觉悟，提高了革命警惕性的时候，任何反革命分子是决然没有活动余地的。
