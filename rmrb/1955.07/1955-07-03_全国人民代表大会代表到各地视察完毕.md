Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The National People's Congress deputies who have been conducting inspection work throughout the country have now generally completed their inspections. The deputies are arriving in Beijing one after another, preparing to attend the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.

During their inspections, the deputies went deep into factories, mines, and peasant households, extensively engaging with the masses and collecting many opinions and requests. Many deputies held forums with workers and peasants at the inspection sites. Deng Fangzhi, a National People's Congress deputy in Sichuan Province in her sixties, braved the scorching sun to visit many peasant households, collecting over one hundred opinions and requests from the masses regarding the government's work. Zha Xi Wangxu, a deputy inspecting in Qinghai Province, arrived at the construction site on the Maqin Snow Mountain, 4,800 meters above sea level, to inspect the road construction; he promptly relayed the urgent difficulties encountered in the road construction, which he had gathered on-site, to the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee. Some deputies went deep into the Greater Khingan Range forest area to inspect the forestry industry. In remote areas such as Honghe, Nujiang, Lancangjiang, and Lijiang in Yunnan, deputies conducted inspections, visiting people of various ethnic groups and extensively gathering the opinions of people in minority areas regarding the government's work.

The deputies were greatly encouraged by witnessing the development of various national construction endeavors during their inspections. Deputies inspecting in Hunan, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces witnessed the new look of urban construction and the thriving scene in the countryside. They were very excited to see the soaring production enthusiasm of workers and peasants and the daily improvement of their lives. Deputies inspecting in Tianjin personally witnessed the new atmosphere that emerged after many private factories were unified in arranging production tasks, and they warmly supported the government's measures.

After the inspections, the deputies mostly held meetings with people's committees at all levels in the localities, reflecting the opinions of the masses to the government, and some criticized shortcomings in the government's work. Many deputies who inspected the rural situation criticized the errors in the mutual aid and cooperation movement that violated the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, as well as the confusion in the grain supply work. Deputies inspecting factories and mines seriously criticized wasteful phenomena. Some deputies who inspected minority areas raised suggestions for improvement targeting shortcomings in the government's implementation of ethnic policies.

Deputies inspecting in Hubei, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Fujian, Yunnan, and other places also seriously criticized the right-leaning paralysis of certain government cadres based on their own understanding of the situation. They suggested that the government strengthen public security work and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. Deputies inspecting in Chongqing received many suggestions from the local masses demanding severe suppression and thorough elimination of all counter-revolutionaries. The deputies studied the opinions of the masses and put forward suggestions to the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee and public security departments to strengthen public security work. Deputies inspecting in Heilongjiang Province seriously criticized some county public security organs and judicial organs for being too lenient and complacent towards counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders, and for neglecting the dictatorship over the enemies of the revolution; they suggested that the Provincial People's Committee take measures to quickly correct these shortcomings.

The relevant leading organs in various places warmly welcomed the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the deputies. Heilongjiang and Hunan provinces specifically convened meetings of the Provincial People's Committee to listen to the deputies' opinions on the government's work. Some provincial and municipal people's committees also sorted out the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the deputies and instructed relevant departments to study and implement them seriously.
