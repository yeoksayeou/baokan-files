Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 12th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio said at a gathering hosted by the Jakarta branch of the Indonesian Nationalist Party on the 10th that the treaty between Indonesia and China on the issue of dual nationality is one of the encouraging results of the Asian-African Conference. He said that this treaty has set a precedent for resolving similar issues between Indonesia and other countries, as well as between other countries themselves.

Subandrio said that the Indonesian government only recognizes one China, namely People's China, and regards the Taiwan issue as an internal affair of People's China. He said, therefore, that those with dual nationality should choose between Indonesian citizenship and citizenship of the People's Republic of China.

    苏纳约外长谈关于双重国籍问题的条约
    新华社雅加达十二日讯　印度尼西亚外交部长苏纳约十日在印度尼西亚国民党雅加达支部主办的一次集会上说，印度尼西亚和中国关于双重国籍问题的条约是亚非会议的令人鼓舞的结果之一。他说，这个条约已经为解决印度尼西亚和其他国家之间以及其他国家相互之间的类似问题树立了典范。
    苏纳约说，印度尼西亚政府只承认一个中国，即人民中国，并且把台湾问题看做是人民中国的内政问题。他说，因此，那些有双重国籍的人应该在印度尼西亚公民资格和中华人民共和国公民资格之间进行选择。
