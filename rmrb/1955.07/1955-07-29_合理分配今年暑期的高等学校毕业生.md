    Rationally Allocate This Year's College Graduates

    The allocation of over 50,000 college graduates for the summer of 1955 has now begun. The allocation of this year’s graduates will still be conducted according to the established principle of "centralized use and prioritized allocation" and the principle of "integration of learning and application." However, in order to further implement this principle, the allocation of graduates in various categories and departments this summer should adopt a more detailed approach. That is, according to the professional nature of different categories and departments and the actual needs of various undertakings, different allocation priorities should be determined separately. For example, graduates of mechanical engineering departments should be mainly used in the mechanical industry, that is, the production preparation and new product design of the machine manufacturing industry in the 156 projects; graduates of geology departments should be mainly used in geological survey work, and appropriate consideration should also be given to the needs of production geology; graduates of civil engineering and architecture departments should be mainly used in the basic construction projects of heavy industry and the construction of emerging industrial cities. Furthermore, the key areas for the allocation of agricultural graduates are the main grain-producing areas, newly reclaimed grain-producing areas, and technical crop areas, and state-owned agricultural enterprises should be appropriately strengthened and various regions should be taken care of.

    New regulations have been made this year regarding the allocation principles for graduates in agriculture, forestry, political science and law, and the arts. The principle of "local allocation and central adjustment" adopted in 1954 has proven to have certain difficulties in practice over the past year, and this summer it has been changed to the principle of overall consideration based on national needs. Graduates of normal schools will still adopt the allocation principle of "local allocation and central adjustment."

    Since the key construction areas and the areas where universities are located are not completely consistent, and the graduates of some newly established majors should meet the needs of the whole country, the transfer of graduates will be more frequent this summer, which will inevitably increase the difficulty of the allocation work. However, personnel departments and universities in various regions should overcome difficulties and complete the allocation tasks in accordance with the relevant policies for allocation work. First, graduates with different qualifications should be allocated according to the different nature of various jobs; second, necessary consideration should be given to the actual difficulties of graduates' health, family, etc.

    It should be estimated that, on the one hand, in order to support the construction of the country, it is difficult to fully take care of the actual difficulties of some graduates; on the other hand, there are indeed a few graduates who are attached to the life in big cities and are unwilling to go to the inland, to the countryside, or even unwilling to leave the cities they are used to living in. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for graduates.

    Graduates should realize that our country is still economically backward, and it will take a considerable period of arduous construction to catch up with advanced countries. Many of our construction undertakings need to start from scratch. For example, in the industrial field, new industrial bases must be built in the inland and remote areas to form a reasonable industrial distribution; correspondingly, many new railways and highways must also be built in the inland and remote areas. Of course, it is more difficult to carry out construction work in the inland and remote areas; however, the more difficult the place is, the more it needs energetic people. What the country requires of graduates is to be able to consciously devote themselves to arduous construction work, not to be afraid of difficulties, and not to be greedy for comfort. Graduates should also see that the people of the whole country are working hard and frugally for socialist construction. Today, the more difficulties we overcome and the more hardships we endure, the sooner we can establish a long-term happy life. Even if some personal practical difficulties cannot be solved for a while, we should try to overcome them and happily go to work.

    Thanks to the implementation of the principle of integrating learning with application on the basis of national needs, the allocation and use of college graduates have been largely reasonable in recent years. However, many facts revealed in newspapers and magazines recently show that there are still quite serious irrational phenomena in the allocation and use of college graduates. At a time when the country's construction is very short of talents, this issue deserves serious attention. The reasons for this phenomenon are mainly: some employers' needs plans and allocation plans for graduates are not accurate, and the departments responsible for allocating graduates do not review them strictly, so that the allocation plan itself has a certain degree of blindness. Some employers lack serious research on the combination of the professional use of graduates and the actual work needs. Some employers allocate too many engineering graduates to work in central and local administrative agencies, etc. The fundamental reason is that some departments and some leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of rationally using professional talents and cherishing talents for the socialist construction of our country, and therefore do not pay enough attention to the issue of rationally allocating and using college graduates.

    This summer, the work allocation of college graduates should learn from the past shortcomings and earnestly overcome these shortcomings. In addition to carefully reviewing the needs plans and allocation plans of their departments in the future, all employing departments, especially the industrial departments, should put forward practical and feasible improvement methods based on the use of graduates and the existing problems in their departments this summer, and issue instructions to their subordinate factories, mines, and enterprises. After the allocation of graduates is completed, a serious inspection should be carried out on the use of graduates in their departments, and graduates who are improperly used should be quickly given reasonable adjustments. One-sidedly emphasizing the needs of one's own unit, adopting a bureaucratic attitude of delaying and ignoring graduates' reasonable requests for work adjustments, being unwilling to adjust graduates who are not suitable for their own unit to other units in need, and even suppressing graduates from expressing their opinions is a kind of departmentalism that must be opposed. For the allocation of engineering graduates, all employing departments should allocate them to work in grass-roots units as much as possible, except for those who need to stay in the upper-level institutions. All factories, mines, and enterprises should allocate graduates to directly participate in production and technical work as much as possible, so that graduates can be trained in practical work.

    How to help graduates continuously improve politically and quickly improve their professional skills after they start working, so that they can quickly become experts in the work they are engaged in, in order to reduce the difficulties of the lack of cadres and weak technical forces in the construction industry, is an important issue currently facing employing units. Some employing departments, especially some newly built factories and mines, are too busy with production and basic construction and lack the necessary leadership for the work of college graduates during their internship period, and they have not done enough to boldly promote the outstanding workers among them to take on more important work, which has hindered the growth of technical forces to a certain extent. This situation must be changed. The work of universities in cultivating construction talents is only a basic stage in the entire cadre training process. The learning of college graduates in school is only to lay the foundation for future work, and they must continue to be trained in a planned way in their work positions. Our country's socialist construction is a long-term undertaking. We must not only see the needs of current work, but also see the needs of long-term construction. In a few years, our country must have thousands of senior professional cadres who play a backbone role in various construction works. We should cultivate a generation of experts with high socialist consciousness, proficient in business, and with rich construction experience in actual work for the future construction industry, just as the Soviet Union once did. Every employing department should take on this task.

    All employing departments, local personnel departments, and universities must learn from the experiences and lessons of past work in this summer's allocation of college graduates and improve the allocation work. The graduates who have been educated by the Party and the state will also obey the allocation, happily go to the glorious work posts, and work hard to learn and improve their ideological and professional level, and contribute their knowledge to the construction of the motherland.

### 合理分配今年暑期的高等学校毕业生

    合理分配今年暑期的高等学校毕业生
    一九五五年暑假的五万多名高等学校毕业生的分配工作现已开始。今年毕业生的工作分配，仍然根据既定的“集中使用、重点配备”的方针和“学用一致”的原则进行。但为了进一步具体地贯彻这个方针和原则，今年暑期在考虑各类、各系科毕业生的分配时，应采用比较细致的作法，即按照不同类、不同系科的专业性质和各种事业的实际需要情况，分别确定不同的分配重点。如机械系科的毕业生，应该主要用于机械工业，即一百五十六项工程中机器制造工业的生产准备和新产品设计；地质系科的毕业生，应该主要用于地质调查工作，对于生产地质的需要，也作适当的照顾；土木建筑系科的毕业生，应该主要用于重工业的基本建设工程和新兴工业城市的建设工作。再如，农科类毕业生的配备重点是主要产粮区、新垦产粮区和技术作物区，并适当充实国营农业企业和照顾各地区。
    农、林、政法、艺术等类毕业生的分配原则，今年作了新的规定。一九五四年所采取的“地方分配、中央调剂”的原则，经过一年来的实践证明，执行起来确有一定的困难，今年暑假已改为根据全国的需要统筹考虑的原则。师范类毕业生则仍采用
  “地方分配、中央调剂”的分配原则。
    由于重点建设地区和高等学校分布的地区不完全一致，加以某些新设置的专业的毕业生应当满足全国的需要，今年暑期毕业生的调动就更加频繁，这不能不增加调配工作的困难。但各地人事部门及高等学校应当排除困难，根据有关调配工作的政策，完成调配任务。首先，要根据各种工作不同的性质配备具有不同条件的毕业生；其次，对于毕业生的身体、家庭等实际困难，应该给予必要的照顾。
    应该估计到，一方面，为了支援国家的建设，对有些毕业生的实际困难，难以完全照顾；另一方面，确实有少数毕业生留恋大城市的生活，不愿到内地、到农村，甚至不愿离开自己住惯了的城市，因此，必须加强对毕业生的思想教育工作。
    毕业生应该认识到，我们的国家在经济上还是落后的，要经过相当长期的艰苦的建设，才能赶上先进的国家。我们的许多建设事业是需要平地起家的，譬如，在工业方面，必须在内地和边远地区建设新的工业基地，以形成合理的工业分布；与此相适应的，还要在内地和边远地区建设许多新的铁路和公路等等。当然，到内地和边远地区去进行建设工作是比较艰苦的；但是，愈是艰苦的地方就愈需要生气勃勃的人，国家所要求于毕业生的，是能够自觉地投入艰苦的建设工作，不怕困难，不贪安逸。毕业生还要看到，全国人民为了社会主义建设，都在节衣缩食地艰苦奋斗，今天我们多克服一些困难，多忍受一些艰苦，就能够更快地建立起长远的幸福生活。个人的某些实际困难，即便一时不能解决，也应该努力加以克服，愉快地走上工作岗位。
    由于执行了在国家需要的基础上贯彻“学用一致”的原则，几年来，对高等学校毕业生的分配和使用大体上是合理的。但是，近来报纸杂志揭露的许多事实说明，目前对高等学校毕业生的分配、使用还存在着相当严重的不合理的现象。在国家建设十分缺乏人材的时候，这一问题值得严重注意。造成这种现象的原因主要是：有的用人单位拟订的毕业生需要计划和配备计划不准确，而负责分配毕业生的部门又审查不严，致使分配计划本身就带有一定程度的盲目性。有的用人单位对毕业生所学专业用途和实际工作需要相结合的问题缺乏认真研究。有的用人单位分配了过多的工科毕业生在中央和地方的管理机关工作等等。根本原因则是有些部门和有些领导干部，对合理使用专业人材、珍惜人材这一问题对于我国社会主义建设事业的重要意义认识不足，因而对于合理分配、使用高等学校毕业生的问题重视不够。
    今年暑假高等学校毕业生的工作分配，应该从过去的缺点中吸取教训，认真克服这些缺点。各用人部门特别是各工业部门，除了今后应认真审查本部门的需要计划和配备计划以外，今年暑假应该根据本部门毕业生的使用情况及存在的问题，提出切实可行的改进办法，对所属各厂、矿、企业下达指示。毕业生工作分配完毕后，对本部门毕业生的使用情况，应认真进行一次检查，对使用不当的毕业生迅速给予合理的调整。片面强调本单位工作的需要，对毕业生提出的合理的调整工作的要求，采取拖延不理的官僚主义态度，不愿将不适合本单位的毕业生调整给其他需要的单位，甚至压制毕业生提意见，是一种本位主义的作法，必须反对。各用人部门对工科毕业生的分配，除必要留在上层机构者外，应尽可能把他们分配去基层单位工作，各厂、矿、企业应该尽可能地分配毕业生直接参加生产技术工作，使毕业生能在实际工作中得到锻炼。
    毕业生参加工作以后，如何帮助他们在政治上不断进步，业务上迅速提高，使他们能够很快地成为自己所从事的工作的内行，以期减少建设事业中干部缺乏、技术力量薄弱的困难，是目前摆在用人单位面前的重要课题。有的用人部门，特别是有些新建厂、矿，因为忙于生产和基本建设，对于高等学校毕业生在见习期间的工作，缺乏应有的领导，大胆提拔他们中间的优秀工作者担负更重要的工作，也做得不够，这就使技术力量的生长受到了一定的阻碍。这种情况必须改变。高等学校培养建设人材的工作，只是整个干部培养过程的一个基础阶段。高等学校毕业生在学校中的学习只是为将来的工作打下基础，必须在工作岗位上对他们继续有计划地加以培养。我国的社会主义建设事业是长期的，我们不仅要看到目前工作的需要，还要看到长远建设的需要。若干年后，我国必须有成千上万在各种建设工作中起骨干作用的高级专业干部。我们应该在实际工作中，为将来的建设事业培养出一代具有高度社会主义觉悟、精通业务并具有丰富的建设经验的专家，就像苏联曾经做到的那样。每一个用人部门都应该把这个任务担当起来。
    各用人部门、各地人事部门和高等学校，在今年暑假高等学校毕业生分配工作中一定要吸取过去工作中的经验教训，把分配工作提高一步。受过党和国家教育的毕业生们，也将会服从分配，愉快地走上光荣的工作岗位，并在工作中努力学习，提高思想和业务水平，把所学的知识贡献给祖国的建设事业。
