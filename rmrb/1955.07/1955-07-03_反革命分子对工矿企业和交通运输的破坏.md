　　Counter-Revolutionary Sabotage of Factories, Mines, and Transportation
　　An Ming
　　Long before the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, scurried out of mainland China, they had already planted a large number of secret agents and other counter-revolutionaries in factories, mines, and the transportation system. After the 1951 campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, these hidden counter-revolutionaries were not completely eliminated. In order to sabotage and obstruct our country's socialist construction, the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandit gang not only continued to use the counter-revolutionaries who had already been lurking, but also constantly sent new special agent spies to infiltrate the mainland, taking advantage of our recruitment of technical personnel and organization of labor employment to sneak into factories, mines, and transportation departments, put on the false masks of "technical personnel," "workers," and "staff," cleverly hiding themselves to carry out various sabotage activities.
　　The main methods used by counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage in factories and mines were to sabotage from design and technical guidance; to create accidents by exploiting various loopholes, damaging machinery and equipment; and to carry out sabotage during the production process, especially in the trial production of new products. The characteristic of the sabotage was that it was often disguised as "responsibility accidents" or "lack of experience." Li Dehou, a reactionary element lurking in the Xiahuayuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province, deliberately violated the design and repeatedly refused the suggestions of the workers, insisting on mining, resulting in a major gas explosion accident that killed thirty-eight workers and poisoned one hundred and fifty-six workers with gas, causing great losses to the country. Damage to machinery and equipment has also been discovered in various places. Counter-revolutionaries, fearing that our production would develop rapidly, tried every means to sabotage and obstruct the trial production of new products. Ma Lizhi, a counter-revolutionary lurking in a factory in Fushun as a "technician," was one of them. He once used his authority and the lack of technical knowledge of new workers to violate the operating procedures that only allowed adjusting the "flow rate" (the chemical composition to be added each time) once during the trial production of a certain new product, but repeatedly adjusted it seven or eight times each time. When the leadership discovered this situation and the workshop director personally took charge of the trial production, he changed his sabotage method, secretly discharging the materials in advance and, taking the opportunity to sort out the operating procedures records, secretly changed the specified temperature, so that the trial production of the new product ultimately failed.
　　Counter-revolutionaries are also carrying out vicious sabotage in our transportation departments. In the second half of last year alone, multiple accidents involving ships running aground, stranding, colliding, sinking, exploding, catching fire, and damage to vehicle and ship machinery occurred in three provinces, two cities, and the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau. In order to carry out sabotage in our transportation system, the U.S.-Chiang special agent agencies have established so-called "Sea General Intelligence Office" and "China Seamen's Union" and other special agent organizations, specializing in sending special agent spies to infiltrate the mainland and sneak into our transportation departments to engage in sabotage. Last year, there were many accidents, large and small, in the national railway system due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries. Zeng Genglin, a "Central Bureau of Statistics" special agent hidden in our Xuzhou Station, used his duty shifts to create traffic chaos and obstruct the on-time transportation of trains. Counter-revolutionary Xu Wenliang sneaked into the basic construction engineering team of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Jiangsu Province as a foreman. Taking advantage of the construction of a new wooden bridge, he deliberately increased the height of the bridge piers by 300 millimeters compared to the original specification; made the iron railings of the bridge very short; and did not install the bent ends of the iron railings according to the drawings, so that the bridge deck could not withstand the design pressure, seriously endangering the safety of transportation.
　　In addition to the above-mentioned sabotage activities, counter-revolutionaries in our factories, mines, and transportation systems also directly engage in arson and explosions. The entire factory building of the Second Work Area of the Matian Coal Mine in Hunan Province was set on fire by counter-revolutionary Liang Zhongshu in July last year. The arson of the factory building caused a gas explosion underground, killing and injuring more than forty workers. The entire work area was shut down for one and a half months, causing a national loss of 60,000 yuan. Yuan Zongchao, a counter-revolutionary in the Hubei Paper Mill, deliberately threw a twelve-inch long baffle into the pulp pool, damaging sixty-five fly knives and eleven bottom knives, causing a national loss of 220,000 yuan. The Chiang gang’s "Security Bureau" also repeatedly instructed special agents to set fire to and explode important bridges, tunnels, stations, and warehouses on our railway trunk lines. In June last year, special agents lurking in Guangdong conspired to explode a freight train from Shenzhen to Guangzhou south of the Buji Station. In December, they conspired to use a time bomb to explode the train from Kowloon to Shenzhen. In Guangdong Province, from August to December last year, more than ten highway bridges were burned. The telecommunications lines between Chaozhou and Shantou were also cut off continuously. During the same period, bridge burning incidents also occurred in Hubei, Guangxi, and other provinces. A warehouse of a new railway project was set on fire by special agents, causing a loss of more than 17,000 yuan. The U.S.-Chiang special agent agencies also organized a water blasting team in Hong Kong, Macao, and enemy-occupied islands along the coast, specializing in sabotaging our ships sailing overseas. When a certain ship of our South China Shipping Bureau was about to enter the dock for repairs in a certain place, special agents once attempted to destroy it with a water mine.
　　The theft and robbery of state property, the collection of information on the production of our economic enterprises and military intelligence, are also important aspects of the sabotage carried out by counter-revolutionaries. In May of this year, the "Guixin" motor sailboat of the Zhujiang Shipping Bureau, which sailed from Haikou to Beihai, was robbed by twenty-six counter-revolutionaries disguised as workers when it sailed to the sea area of Wushi Port. A theft group led by counter-revolutionaries Wang Liben and others, consisting of hooligans and bandits, has been active on the Huangpu River for a long time, specializing in stealing state property from ships of our state-owned wharfs and factories under the guise of the "garbage clearing service team." Counter-revolutionaries lurking in factories, mines, and transportation departments have continuously stolen our military and economic secrets. Wang Dizhong, a special agent who sneaked into the design company of the Guangdong Construction Engineering Bureau as a first-class "technician," stole more than twenty confidential documents related to engineering, etc., within seven months last year, including the scale and design of a certain shipyard. Zhang Wanlu, a special agent who sneaked into Tanggu, Tianjin, provided the U.S.-Chiang special agent agencies with intelligence more than twenty times, including some military intelligence and the construction of the new port wharf and the inventory in the wharf warehouse. In addition, hidden counter-revolutionaries are also developing special agent organizations within our enterprises, attempting to carry out larger-scale sabotage activities.
　　These sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries have been severely suppressed with the efforts of our local public security organs and the active support of the broad masses of the people. However, this does not mean that the sabotage activities of the remaining and unpunished counter-revolutionaries will stop. On the contrary, they will be more covert, more cunning, and more vicious in sabotaging us. Because our great cause of socialist industrialization is developing rapidly, our enemies increasingly feel that they have reached the end of the road, so they are intensifying their sabotage of our socialist industrialization. And some of the laxity in our work system and the low vigilance of some staff members have also left loopholes for the enemy's sabotage. Therefore, all staff members in all enterprises must raise their vigilance, open their eyes, and resolutely eliminate the hidden counter-revolutionaries.

　　反革命分子对工矿企业和交通运输的破坏
　　安明
    美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团远在滚出中国大陆的前夕，就在工矿企业和交通运输系统中埋伏了大批的特务分子和其他反革命分子。经过一九五一年镇压反革命的运动，这些潜伏的反革命分子并没有完全肃清。美帝国主义及蒋匪帮为了破坏和阻挠我国的社会主义建设事业，除了继续利用已经潜伏下来的反革命分子从事破坏以外，还不断派遣新的特务间谍分子潜入大陆，利用我们招聘技术人员、组织劳动就业等机会，钻进工矿企业和交通运输部门，戴上“技术人员”、“工人”、“职员”的假面具，巧妙地隐藏起来，进行各种破坏活动。
    反革命分子在工矿企业中进行破坏的主要方法是从设计、技术指导上进行破坏；利用各种空隙制造事故，破坏机器设备；在生产操作过程特别是新产品试制中进行破坏。破坏的特点，多是以“责任事故”或者“经验不足”为借口来掩护。潜伏在河北省下花园煤矿的反动分子李德厚，故意违反设计，又屡次拒绝职工的建议而坚持采掘，以致发生瓦斯爆炸的重大事故，死亡职工三十八人，瓦斯中毒一百五十六人，使国家遭受了极大的损失。破坏机器设备的事件，各地也都有发现。反革命分子唯恐我们生产迅速发展，就千方百计破坏和阻挠新产品的试制工作。潜伏在抚顺某厂充任“技术员”的反革命分子马立智，就是其中的一个。他曾经利用职权和新工人不懂技术的空隙，在试制某种新产品时，不按每次试制只准调整一次“流速”
  （每次应加的化学成份）的操作规程去作，每次却反复调整七、八次之多。当领导上发现这一情况并由车间主任亲自掌握试制时，他就变换了破坏办法，暗中提前出料，并借整理操作规程记录的机会，偷改了规定的温度，以致新产品的试制工作最后归于失败。
    反革命分子在我交通运输部门中也进行着恶毒的破坏。去年下半年，仅在三省二市和长江航运局，就发生了多起轮船触礁、搁浅、碰撞、沉没、爆炸、起火、车船机械损坏等大小事故。美蒋特务机关为了在我交通运输系统进行破坏，设有所谓“海总情报处”、“中华海员工会”等特务机构，专门派遣特务间谍分子潜入大陆，钻进我交通运输部门从事破坏。去年全年，全国铁路系统因反革命分子的破坏，发生大小事故很多。隐藏在我徐州车站的“中统”特务曾庚林，曾借值班时机制造行车混乱，阻碍列车正点运输。反革命分子徐文良混入江苏省戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂基本建设工程队当领工，趁新建木桥的机会，他故意把桥墩高度比原规定的加高了三百公厘；把桥的铁栏楞做得很短；铁拦楞弯头不按图样安装，致使桥面承受压力不能达到设计标准，严重危害了交通运输的安全。
    反革命分子在我工矿企业和交通运输系统中除进行上述破坏活动以外，还直接进行纵火、爆炸。湖南省马田煤矿二工区的全部厂房，就是被反革命分子梁中恕在去年七月间纵火烧毁的。由于厂房纵火而引起了井下瓦斯爆炸，死伤职工四十多人，整个工区停工一个半月，国家损失达六万元。湖北省造纸厂反革命分子袁宗朝，故意把十二吋长的活板丢入浆池，打坏飞刀六十五片、底刀十一片，使国家损失二十二万元。蒋贼“保密局”还多次指示特务分子纵火烧毁和爆炸我铁路干线的重要桥梁、隧道、车站和仓库。去年六月，潜伏在广东的特务分子阴谋在布吉车站以南爆炸由深圳开返广州的货物列车，十二月又阴谋用定时炸弹爆炸我由九龙开入深圳的列车。广东省境内，从去年八月到十二月，公路桥梁被烧十余座。潮州到汕头间的电讯线路也曾经被连续割断。同一时期，湖北、广西等省也发生桥梁被烧的事件。新建铁路某工程的一个仓库，被特务纵火烧毁，损失一万七千多元。美蒋特务机关还在香港、澳门及沿海敌占岛屿，组织水上爆破队专门破坏我海外航行的船只，我华南海运局某号轮在某地拟入坞修理时，特务分子就曾经企图用水雷把它炸毁。
    盗窃和抢劫国家财产，搜集我经济企业生产情况和军事情报，也是反革命分子进行破坏的重要方面。今年五月，由海口开往北海的珠江航运局“桂信”号机帆船驶行到乌石港海面时，就被冒充工人的二十六个反革命分子抢走。以反革命分子王立本等为首纠合流氓盗匪分子组成的盗窃集团，长期活动于黄浦江上，在“清倒垃圾服务组”这一职业的掩护下，专门在我国营码头工厂的船只上盗窃国家财产。潜伏在工矿企业和交通运输部门的反革命分子，不断窃取了我军事和经济机密。混入广东建筑工程局设计公司充任一级“技术员”的特务分子王砥中，在去年七个月内，就窃取了工程等方面的机密二十多件，其中有某船坞的规模和设计等。潜入天津塘沽的特务张万禄，先后供给美蒋特务机关情报二十多次，其中包括一部分军事情报和新港码头修建情况及码头仓库存货等。此外，潜藏的反革命分子还在我企业内部发展特务组织，企图进行更大规模的破坏活动。
    反革命分子的这些破坏活动，经我各地公安机关的努力和广大人民群众的积极支持，都已给予严厉的镇压。但是，这并不是说，残余的、漏网的反革命分子的破坏活动就会停止了，相反，他们还会更加隐蔽、更加狡猾而恶毒地来破坏我们。因为我们的社会主义工业化的伟大事业正在迅速发展，我们的敌人越来越觉得自己到了穷途末路，因此他们就加紧来破坏我们社会主义工业化的事业。而我们工作中的某些制度不严、某些工作人员的警惕性不高，也给敌人的破坏留下了可乘之隙。因此，一切企业中的工作人员，都必须提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，坚决肃清暗藏的反革命分子。
