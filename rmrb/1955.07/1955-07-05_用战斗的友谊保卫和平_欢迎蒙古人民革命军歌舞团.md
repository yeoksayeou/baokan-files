　　Defending Peace with Combat Friendship
　　——Welcome the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army
　　Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
　　We have heard Mongolians say, "From the moment Lenin and Sukhe-Bator met and shook hands in the Kremlin, the sun rose over our homeland."

　　This not only illustrates the relationship between the Mongolian People's Republic and the great Soviet Union, but also illustrates the glorious path the Mongolian People's Republic has traveled. This nomadic people, who had been ruled by the foreign Qing Dynasty and feudal princes and lamas for more than 300 years, has now been built into a socialist country because it followed the path of the Soviet Union and followed Lenin's instructions: "...with the help of the proletariat of the most advanced countries, backward countries can avoid the stage of capitalist development and transition to the Soviet system, and after a certain stage of development, transition to communism" (Lenin: "National Liberation Movement and the Strategy and Tactics of the Communist International"). For many years, it was difficult for people to imagine that modern cities and modern industries could be built in the desert - the Gobi Desert. Now, these have all become reality. As Comrade Stalin said:

　　"Formerly, it was 'customarily always' believed that the world had been divided since ancient times into inferior races and superior races, into black races and white races, the former having no ability to reach civilization and destined to be exploited, the latter being the sole representative of civilization and bearing the mission of exploiting the former.

　　Now it should be considered that this absurdity has been shattered and discarded. One of the most important results of the October Revolution is that it dealt a fatal blow to this absurdity, because it factually showed that those non-European nations who were liberated and led on the path of Soviet development, their ability to promote truly advanced culture and truly advanced civilization is no less than that of European nations."
　　("The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 10, page 207, "The International Nature of the October Revolution")

　　The non-European nation that Comrade Stalin referred to as being no less than European is Mongolia—Mongolia under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mongolia protected by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army.

　　This is also our glorious neighbor—heroic Mongolia. Mongolia that has created miracles in the history of human development. Soldiers and officers of a Soviet Air Force Regiment also praised it in a poem written to the Mongolian people during World War II:

　　"You are warmed by the sun of true truth,
　　Are beautiful, rich, and powerful.
　　To you, the kind and bright country,
　　Mongolia, the country of miracles, we pay our respects.
　　In difficult days, from the Mongolian aimak
　　Gifts and salutations were sent to us on the front line—
　　This is a sincere sign of love and friendship,
　　Along with them—also the blessing of victory.
　　This is our answer to the Mongolian people:
　　Friends, we thank you for everything, everything,
　　We will defend immortal freedom,
　　And defend the happiness of all people."

　　During World War II, the Mongolian people used their own money to establish a tank column, named "Revolutionary Mongolia." The workers of the Mongolian People's Republic also bore the expenses of this tank brigade until the end of the war. The tank brigade "Revolutionary Mongolia" gloriously raised the battle flag given to it by Marshal Choibalsan near Moscow in January 1943 all the way to Berlin. In addition, the fighter air squadron "Mongolian Arat" was established with the money of the Arat (working people).

　　Here, we cannot help but recall the assistance of the Mongolian people and the People's Revolutionary Army to our people in the fight against Japanese fascism in World War II in coordination with the Soviet army and our army. The Mongolian People's Republic sent an army of 80,000 people to the front to fight against Japan. This army, acting in concert with the Red Army, completed the famous march across the Gobi Desert and the Greater Khingan Mountains.

　　The desert area that the Mongolian army passed through was almost uninhabited, with no wells or supply stations along the way, but under these very difficult conditions, they heroically defeated the enemy and completed their historical mission. Our liberation of Northeast China and the liberation of all of China are also inseparable from the victory of the Soviet Union and the advance of the Mongolian army.

　　In the movie "The Victory of the Chinese People," we can still see the heroic posture of Marshal Choibalsan entering Zhangbei on horseback. Even at his advanced age, he personally led troops to the battlefield. I can say that at that time, the people watching the film were applauding the appearance of Marshal Choibalsan on the screen with a very grateful and respectful mood.

　　We can never forget the lofty internationalism and revolutionary heroism demonstrated by Mongolian hero Avuksi in coordinating with the Soviet army to liberate Zhangjiakou, China. Comrade Avuksi, in the battle to liberate Zhangjiakou in coordination with the Soviet army and our army in August 1945, bravely penetrated deep into the enemy's阵地 in the Chabei area, was wounded five times, insisted on staying on the front line, eliminated many enemy firepower points, ensured the victorious advance of the troops, and finally sacrificed himself in the Chabei area. The Mongolian People's Republic posthumously awarded him the title of Mongolian Hero, and the famous Mongolian writer D.Sengge wrote a novella to commend the heroic deeds of this hero and his combat friendship with our country. The song and dance troupe's visit to our country this time also includes the program "Ode to Hero Avuksi." We can see from this how deep the combat friendship forged with blood between the people of our two countries is.

　　Of course, we can also recall a little further: Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's memorial mentioned that "to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." The Mongolian People's Republic's answer to Tanaka's aggressive memorial was to inflict a devastating blow on the invading Japanese army near the Khalkha River, causing the Japanese army to lose 60,000 soldiers and officers, of whom 25,000 were killed on the battlefield. From then on, the Japanese warlords never dared to provoke the Mongolian border.

　　This is the People's Revolutionary Army of the Mongolian People's Republic. We can fully believe that this army, built on the example of the Soviet Union, has not only established immortal feats in the past in defending its own national independence and freedom and defending peace, but will also play a great role in the cause of defending peace in the future.

　　Now, the representative of this heroic army—the Song and Dance Troupe of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army has come to visit our country. We do not feel strange to them at all. This is our closest comrade-in-arms. For the peace of the Far East and the world, and for the freedom and independence of our motherland, we have fought side by side. Just as we welcomed Marshal Choibalsan's appearance on the screen, we also welcome the visit of our dearest guests, our dearest brothers, with gratitude and respect.

　　This song and dance troupe was established as early as 1932, growing from ten people at the beginning to about two hundred people today. In addition to the constant care of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the government, and the army, the troupe's own experience also shows that it has been tempered in battle, grown up from inheriting and carrying forward the excellent national traditions, and enriched itself by learning the advanced art of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

　　The song and dance troupe believes that its primary task is to actively participate in improving the military training and political education work of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army and the peaceful development of defending the motherland.

　　The song and dance troupe attaches special importance to developing creation, expressing the images of heroes, learning from models and advanced figures, and publicizing the model deeds of advanced detachments and troops, and advanced producers in industry and agriculture.

　　In addition to improving its own political level and artistic skills, the song and dance troupe also helps improve the artistic skills of troops and corps, and has cultivated many young and talented artistic talents among the soldiers.

　　The song and dance troupe also helps the art groups of enterprises, schools, state-owned farms, and agricultural production cooperatives.

　　This song and dance troupe is one of the largest art groups in the Mongolian People's Republic. In art, there are many aspects worthy of our respect and learning; its artistic direction is also worthy of our respect and learning.

　　We are all honored to be able to welcome this song and dance troupe in our capital—guests who represent the combat friendship between the people and armies of our two countries, Mongolia and China.

　　May this sincere, brotherly combat friendship be further consolidated and developed through this visit of the song and dance troupe and through their outstanding performances—for peace, for the great cause of socialism.

　　Long live the unbreakable combat friendship between the people and armies of Mongolia and China!

　　用战斗的友谊保卫和平
　　——欢迎蒙古人民革命军歌舞团
　　中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长　陈沂
    我们曾经听过蒙古人说：“从列宁和苏赫—巴托尔在克里姆林宫晤面握手的时候起，太阳就在我们的祖国上空升起来了。”
    这不只是说明蒙古人民共和国和伟大的苏联的关系，也是说明蒙古人民共和国所走过的光荣的道路。这个曾经被异族满清和封建王公、喇嘛统治了三百多年的游牧民族，因为走了苏联的道路，遵照列宁所指示的“……在最先进国家底无产阶级帮助之下，落后国家可以避免资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到苏维埃制度，并经过一定的发展阶段过渡到共产主义”（列宁：“民族解放运动与共产国际底战略和策略”），现在已经建设成为一个社会主义的国家了。多少年来人们都很难想像，在沙漠——大戈壁滩上能够建设现代化的城市、现代化的工业。现在，这些也都成为现实了。正如斯大林同志说的：
    “从前，‘照例总是’认为：世界自古以来就分成低等人种和高等人种，分成黑种人和白种人，前者没有达到文明境地的能力，注定成为剥削的对象，后者是文明的唯一代表者，负有剥削前者的使命。
    现在应该认为这种奇谈被打破了，被抛弃了。十月革命最重要的结果之一就是它给这种奇谈以致命的打击，因为它在事实上表明，那些获得解放而被引上苏维埃发展轨道的非欧洲民族，他们推进真正先进文化和真正先进文明的能力是丝毫不亚于欧洲民族的。”
  （“斯大林全集”第十卷，二○七页，“十月革命的国际性质”）
    斯大林同志所指的并不亚于欧洲民族非欧洲民族，就是蒙古——在蒙古人民革命党领导下的蒙古，在蒙古人民革命军保卫下的蒙古。
    这也是我们光荣的邻邦——英雄的蒙古。在人类发展史上创造奇迹的蒙古。苏联一个空军联队的战士和军官在第二次世界大战中写给蒙古人民的诗中也这样称道过：
    “你被真正真理的太阳所温暖，
    是美丽的、丰富的和强大的。
    向你，善良和光明的国家，
    蒙古，奇迹的国家致敬。
    在艰苦的日子里从蒙古艾马克
    向前线给我们寄礼品和敬礼——
    这是热爱和友情的诚恳的记号，
    同它们在一起——还有胜利的祝福。
    这是我们对蒙古人民的答复：
    朋友们，我们感谢一切、一切，
    我们将保卫不朽的自由，
    和保卫一切人民的幸福”。
    在第二次世界大战中，蒙古人民用自己的钱建立了一支坦克纵队，命名为“革命的蒙古”。蒙古人民共和国的劳动者并且自己承担了这个战车旅的开支，直到战争结束为止。战车旅“革命的蒙古”把乔巴山元帅一九四三年一月在莫斯科附近所交给它的战斗旗帜，光荣地举到柏林。此外并以阿拉特（劳动人民）的钱建立驱逐机空军大队“蒙古阿拉特”。
    我们在这里就不能不回忆在第二次世界大战中，蒙古人民和人民革命军在配合苏军和我军消灭日本法西斯的战斗中对我国人民的援助。蒙古人民共和国派遣了八万人的军队到前线同日本作战，这支军队和红军采取共同行动，完成了有名的越过戈壁和大兴安岭的进军。
    蒙古军队所走过的沙漠区几乎没有人烟，路上没有井，也没有军需站，但就在这非常困难的条件下，他们英勇地击溃了敌人，完成了自己的历史任务。我们解放东北，解放全中国，也和苏联，和蒙古军队进军的胜利分不开的。
    在电影“中国人民的胜利”中，我们还可以看到乔巴山元帅骑在马上进入张北的雄姿，以他那样的高年，还亲率部队奔驰疆场。我可以说，当时看影片的人，都是以一种非常感激和尊敬的心情在为乔巴山元帅在银幕上的出现而鼓掌的。
    我们永远不能忘记蒙古英雄阿伏西同志在配合苏军解放我国张家口时所表现的崇高的国际主义和革命英雄主义精神。阿伏西同志曾于一九四五年八月在配合苏军及我军解放张家口的战斗中，在察北地区时，勇猛深入敌阵，负伤五次，坚持不下火线，消灭了敌人许多火力点，保证部队胜利前进，最后牺牲在察北地区。蒙古人民共和国曾追赠他为蒙古英雄，蒙古著名作家德森格写了一个中篇小说来表彰这个英雄的事迹和他对我国的战斗友谊。歌舞团这次来我国访问也带有“英雄阿伏西颂”这个节目。我们当可从这中间来体现我们两国人民用鲜血结成的战斗友谊是如何的深厚。
    我们当然还可以回忆得更远一点：日本首相田中奏折中曾提到“欲征服支那，必先征服满蒙”。蒙古人民共和国对田中这个侵略性奏折的回答就是在哈尔哈河附近给进犯的日本军队以歼灭性的打击，使日本军队损失了六万士兵和军官，其中二万五千人在战场上被打死。从此，日本军阀再不敢向蒙古的边界挑衅了。
    这就是蒙古人民共和国的人民革命军队。我们完全可以相信这支以苏联为榜样建设起来的军队，它不仅过去在保卫自己祖国独立自由和保卫和平中已经建立了不朽的功勋，而且在今后保卫和平事业中也将发挥它极大的作用。
    现在，这支英雄军队的代表——蒙古人民革命军歌舞团来到了我国访问，我们对他们一点也不感到陌生。这是我们的最亲密的战友，为远东和为世界的和平，也为我们祖国的自由和独立，我们曾经并肩作战过。像我们对乔巴山元帅在银幕上的出现一样，我们也是用感激和尊敬的心情来欢迎我们最亲爱的贵宾，我们最亲爱的兄弟的访问的。
    这个歌舞团远在一九三二年即已成立，由开始的十个人达到今天的约二百人，除了蒙古人民革命党、政府和军队的不断关怀外，歌舞团本身的经历也说明了它是从战斗中锻炼出来的，从继承和发扬民族优良传统中成长起来的，也是学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进艺术中来丰富自己的。
    歌舞团认为自己的头等任务，就是积极参加提高蒙古人民革命军的军事训练和政治教育工作及保卫祖国的和平发展事业。
    歌舞团特别重视发展创作，表现英雄、学习模范和先进人物的形象，宣传先进分队和部队、工农业先进生产者的模范事迹。
    歌舞团除了提高自己的政治水平和艺术技巧外，还帮助提高部队和兵团的艺术技巧，并在军人中培养了许多年青的、天才的艺术人材。
    歌舞团同样还帮助企业、学校、国营农场、农业生产组合的艺术团体。
    这个歌舞团是蒙古人民共和国的巨大艺术团体之一，在艺术上许多地方值得我们尊敬和学习；它所遵循的艺术方向也是值得我们尊敬和学习的。
    我们都以能在我国首都欢迎这个歌舞团——代表着我们蒙、中两国人民和军队的战斗友谊的贵宾而感到光荣。
    愿我们这个真诚的兄弟般的战斗友谊，通过歌舞团这次的访问，并通过他们卓越的表演更加巩固和发展起来——为和平，为社会主义的伟大事业。
    蒙、中两国人民和军队之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
