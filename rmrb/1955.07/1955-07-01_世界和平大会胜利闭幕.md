Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 30th: The World Peace Congress held its closing session on the 29th. The meeting was chaired by Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

　　Mäkelä, Chairman of the Finnish Committee for the Defense of Peace, spoke and once again welcomed the delegates attending the conference on behalf of the Finnish peace supporters. He said that the convening of this congress and its work have inspired the Finnish people to further fight for peace.

　　Subsequently, the chairmen of the seven committees established by the Congress spoke. They reported to the delegates on the achievements of the work of each committee, as well as the resolutions passed by these committees.

　　Magnad Saha (India) spoke on behalf of the Committee on Disarmament and Atomic Weapons. He said that the committee reached a unanimously agreed resolution in free discussion. For example, the committee unanimously decided that efforts must be made to ban atomic weapons, destroy stockpiled atomic weapons, and strive for the peaceful use of atomic energy. The committee recommended August 6th—the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima—as a day of struggle against atomic weapons. The committee recommended striving to convene a conference on disarmament issues.

　　Jacques Madaule (France) spoke on behalf of the Committee on Military Blocs and Security. He said that this committee established three subcommittees: the Subcommittee on European Security and the German Question, the Subcommittee on Asian Security, and the Subcommittee on the United Nations and the Defense of Peace. All three subcommittees passed some reports, which reached common conclusions. The first subcommittee unanimously agreed that propaganda against military blocs must be carried out in all countries. The Subcommittee on European Security and the German Question believed that the foundation for universal collective security in Europe must be laid in accordance with the principles announced at the Bandung Conference and the Belgrade talks. The subcommittee also unanimously agreed on the need to unify Germany. The Subcommittee on Asian Security advocated that the People's Republic of China obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations and that Taiwan, an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China, be returned to the People's Republic of China; abide by the Geneva Accords on the Indochina armistice; advocate that relevant countries convene a conference on the Korean issue; and advocate a peaceful solution to the Goa and West Irian issues, etc.

　　Yukil (Syria) reported on behalf of the Committee on National Sovereignty and Peace, Castro (Brazil) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Social Issues, Repaci (Italy) on behalf of the Committee on Cultural Exchange, Mrs. Dunlson (Canada) on behalf of the Committee on Education and Youth, and Donini (Italy) on behalf of the Committee on Cooperation and Activities of Peace Forces.

　　The reports of the chairmen of the committees were applauded by the delegates. The chairman of the congress announced that all opinions, resolutions and suggestions put forward by the committees were adopted and will be disseminated and promoted in various countries.

　　Jean Lafitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, reported on behalf of the Credentials Committee that 1,841 delegates from 68 countries participated in the congress.

　　Next, Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie (France) read out the World Peace Congress Declaration, followed by a vote. A total of 1,493 people voted, with 1,492 votes in favor and one abstention, passing the full text of the declaration. Six people did not vote. After the announcement of the voting results, a storm of sustained applause resounded throughout the hall. The delegates stood up and cheered for a long time, shouting "Long live peace!" in various languages.

　　Finally, Guo Moruo delivered the closing address to the congress. He pointed out that the congress had conducted eight days of discussions on major international issues, including universal disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the wider use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world, respect for national independence, and the establishment of regular economic and cultural relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The congress has reached unanimous agreements on these issues, which is the great achievement of this congress.

　　Guo Moruo continued, this congress was convened at a very important moment. Although there has been some easing of international tensions, the arms race, division and discord, racial discrimination, and especially the threat of atomic war have not yet been eliminated.

　　Guo Moruo said: We place the greatest hope on the four-power summit, hoping that the outcome of this meeting will not disappoint the expectations of the people of the world and that the current tensions will be further eased.

　　Our congress has expressed the world's attitude towards the summit of the great powers. We hope that the four-power summit will consider our declaration in a democratic spirit, thoroughly and with full responsibility.

　　Guo Moruo thanked the Finnish people for their great help in the successful work of the congress.

　　In the last part of his speech, Guo Moruo, as a representative of the Chinese people, sincerely invited all friends who wish to visit China to come to China. He said that our country has been born for less than six years. We still have many shortcomings. We are willing to hear criticism from our friends. He said that thousands of words are hard to compare with facts. The Chinese people will prove with more facts in the future that the Chinese people are loyal friends of peace.

　　Guo Moruo expressed the hope that all the hopes of the congress could be gradually realized through the joint efforts of the people of all countries in the world. He finally shouted: Long live peace and friendship!

　　Guo Moruo's last few words were drowned in thunderous applause. The hall shouted slogans: Long live peace! The cheers lasted for a long time. The congress was then declared closed.

　　世界和平大会胜利闭幕
    据新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：世界和平大会在二十九日举行闭幕会议。会议由世界和平理事会副主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若担任主席。
    芬兰保卫和平大会常设委员会主席麦尔蒂讲话，他代表芬兰和平拥护者再次向参加大会的代表表示欢迎。他说，这次大会的召开以及大会的工作鼓舞着芬兰人民进一步为争取和平而斗争。
    随后由大会成立的七个委员会的主席讲话。他们向代表们报告各委员会工作的成果，以及关于这些委员会所通过的决议。
    麦格纳德·萨哈（印度）代表裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会讲话。他说，委员会在自由讨论中得出了一致同意的决议。譬如，委员会一致决定，必须争取禁止原子武器，销毁储存的原子武器，以及争取和平利用原子能。委员会建议八月六日——在广岛投掷原子弹的一天——作为反对原子武器斗争日。委员会建议争取召开一个关于裁减军备问题的会议。
    雅克·马道尔（法国）代表军事集团和安全问题委员会讲话。他说，这个委员会成立了三个小组委员会：欧洲安全和德国问题小组委员会、亚洲安全问题小组委员会、联合国和保卫和平问题小组委员会。这三个小组委员会都通过了一些报告，在这些报告中得出了共同的结论。第一个小组委员会一致认为，必须在各国进行反对军事集团的宣传。欧洲安全和德国问题小组委员会认为，必须根据万隆会议以及贝尔格莱德会谈所宣布的那些原则来奠定欧洲普遍集体安全的基础。小组委员会还一致认为有必要使德国统一。亚洲安全问题小组委员会主张让中华人民共和国取得它在联合国里的合法地位，把中华人民共和国不可分割的领土——台湾归还中华人民共和国；遵守关于印度支那停战的日内瓦协定；主张有关国家召开关于朝鲜问题的会议；主张和平解决果阿和西伊里安问题等。
    尤基尔（叙利亚）代表民族主权和和平问题委员会，卡斯特罗（巴西）代表经济和社会问题委员会，雷帕奇（意大利）代表文化交流委员会，顿尔逊夫人（加拿大）代表教育和青年问题委员会，多尼尼（意大利）代表和平力量合作和活动问题委员会作了报告。
    各委员会主席的报告都受到了代表们鼓掌赞同。大会主席宣布，各委员会提出的全部意见、决议和建议都被通过，并将在各国加以传播和推行。
    世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德代表资格审查委员会报告说，六十八个国家的一千八百四十一名代表参加了这次大会。
    接着，爱麦虞埃·达斯迪埃—德拉维热里（法国）宣读了世界和平大会宣言，宣读后接着进行投票表决。投票人数一共有一千四百九十三人，以一千四百九十二票赞同，一票弃权通过了宣言全文。六个人没有参加投票。表决结果宣布后，在整个大厅中响起了暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。代表们起立长时间地欢呼，用各种语言高呼“和平万岁！”
    最后，郭沫若向大会致闭幕词。他指出：大会对当前重大的国际问题进行了八天的讨论，这些问题包括普遍裁减军备、禁止原子武器、更广泛地把原子能用于和平，世界上一切国家和平共处，尊重民族独立，在平等和互相尊重的基础上建立经常的经济和文化关系等。大会在这些问题上取得了一致的协议，这就是这次大会的巨大成就。
    郭沫若接着说，这次大会是在非常重要的时刻召开的。虽然国际紧张局势出现了某些缓和的趋势，但是军备竞赛、分裂和分歧、种族歧视、特别是原子战争威胁还没有消除。
    郭沫若说：我们对四国政府首脑会议寄予最大的希望，希望这次会议的结果不致辜负全世界人民的期望，使得目前的紧张局势更加缓和下来。
    我们这次大会表示了全世界对大国首脑会议的态度。我们希望：四国政府首脑会议本着民主的精神，周密地和完全负责地考虑我们的宣言。
    郭沫若感谢芬兰人民对大会的圆满工作作了巨大的帮助。
    郭沫若在发言的最后以中国人民代表的身份，表示诚心诚意地邀请一切希望到中国去的朋友到中国访问。他说，我们的国家诞生还不到六年。我们还有许许多多的缺点。我们愿意听到来自我们朋友方面的批评。他说，千言万语难与事实比拟。中国人民今后将以更多的事实证明：中国人民是和平的忠实朋友。
    郭沫若表示希望：大会的全部希望将能通过世界各国人民的共同努力来逐步实现。他最后高呼：和平和友谊万岁！
    郭沫若的最后几句话为雷动的掌声所淹没。大厅里高呼起口号：和平万岁！欢呼声经久不息。大会至此宣告闭幕。
