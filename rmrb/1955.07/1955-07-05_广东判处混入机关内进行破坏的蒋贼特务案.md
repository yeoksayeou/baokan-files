Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 4th: The Guangdong Provincial People's Court recently tried a case involving a Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization, the "Kuomintang Central Committee Sixth Group South China Working Committee Yue-Sui (Guangdong-Guangzhou) District Work Station Intelligence Group," which had infiltrated government agencies to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage.

The principal offender, Wang Dizhong, was the leader of the "Intelligence Group" and resided in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province. Before Guangzhou's liberation, Wang fled to Hong Kong with his father (the puppet county magistrate of Dongguan County). In Hong Kong, Wang Dizhong had close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization "Kuomintang Central Committee Sixth Group South China Working Committee." This special agent organization knew that Wang Dizhong had studied architectural technology, so they instructed him to find old classmates in Guangzhou and other places to infiltrate our industrial agencies for counter-revolutionary activities. In October 1953, Wang wrote to a classmate working at the Design Company of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau. On December 10th, he personally came to Guangzhou to make contact, using a hypocritical facade to deceive the leadership of the design company into employing him. After Wang returned to Hong Kong, the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization sent two special agents to train Wang in special agent theory and techniques such as "arming his ideology," "intelligence gathering," "inciting defection," "psychological warfare," and secret writing. On March 10, 1954, Wang Dizhong officially joined the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization. The task assigned to him by the special agent organization was to collect intelligence on domestic military, political, and industrial construction and to develop a special agent network. On March 20th, Wang openly infiltrated the Design Company of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, serving as a first-level technician.

After infiltrating the design company, Wang actively collected various intelligence, developed a special agent network, and engaged in technical sabotage.

Wang used various methods to collect intelligence. He utilized his position to accumulate information on various engineering designs he handled and to probe for internal information from the cadres of the construction units. He also exploited the lax system of the design company and the ideological complacency of some cadres, secretly viewing design drawings of other projects undertaken by the company. Through technical personnel on outside assignments, he used communication under the guise of exchanging experience to probe for architectural facilities in other regions. He also instructed the special agents he had recruited to collect intelligence from other departments. Wang successively collected more than twenty pieces of intelligence in various fields, including military, political, and engineering, and secretly sent them to the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization in Hong Kong.

Wang's method of developing a special agent network within the agency was to win over some old classmates and "new colleagues" with whom he was close, using casual conversations to spread corrupt and degenerate ideas to conduct so-called "psychological warfare." He also used these conversations to understand each person's history, background, and ideological weaknesses in order to cater to their preferences and seize opportunities to exploit them by buying them off or drawing them into the special agent network. When Wang's conspiracy to develop an organization within the agency failed, he turned to secret development outside the agency. Through Zhou Shengxi, a technician at the design company, Wang Dizhong met Zhou Shengxi's father, Zhou Naishi (manager of the private "He Lian" Construction Company). Wang learned that Zhou Naishi was a reactionary officer who had been sentenced to two years in prison in 1953 for stealing state property and harbored resentment towards the government. Wang used the introduction of engineering business to win him over and incite him, absorbing Zhou into the special agent organization. Wang used the same method to recruit Liang Quanfu and Zhao Bingheng into the special agent organization.

Using technology to sabotage national construction projects was also a component of Wang's counter-revolutionary criminal plan. His methods of sabotage included delaying the submission of design drawings, violating the contracts signed between the design company and the construction units; creating flawed designs, omitting dimensions, omitting details, scrambling numbers, or making the foundation bearing capacity insufficient, causing the project to sink and crack, in an attempt to achieve the criminal purpose of rework, waste, and loss of state property. All the design projects he handled had varying degrees of sabotage. While in charge of the construction project for the Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Bureau office building, Wang secretly reduced the steel reinforcement of the continuous beam by one-third and installed dozens of prefabricated floor slabs with poor rainproof performance and cracks. The loss was avoided only after the construction unit discovered it.

Based on the criminals' crimes, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court sentenced Wang Dizhong, Zhou Naishi, and Liang Quanfu to death in accordance with the law, and Zhao Bingheng to fifteen years in prison.

### 广东判处混入机关内进行破坏的蒋贼特务案

　　广东判处混入机关内进行破坏的蒋贼特务案
    新华社广州四日电　广东省人民法院最近审判了一个混入机关内部进行反革命破坏的蒋贼特务组织“国民党中央委员会第六组华南工作委员会粤穗区工作站情报组”案件。
    主犯王砥中是“情报组”的组长，家住广东省东莞县。广州解放前夕，王犯随他的父亲（东莞县伪县长）逃往香港。王砥中在香港和蒋贼特务机关“国民党中央委员会第六组华南工作委员会”有密切联系。这个特务机关知道王砥中学过建筑技术，于是就叫王砥中向广州等地找老同学，以便混入我工业机关内部进行反革命活动。一九五三年十月王犯就写信给在广东省建筑工程局设计公司工作的同学，到十二月十日又亲自来到广州市接洽，以伪善的面目骗取了设计公司领导方面的任用。王犯回到香港后，蒋贼特务机关便派出两个特务分子对王犯进行“武装思想”、“情报”、“策反”、“心战”、密写等特务理论和技术训练。在一九五四年三月十日，王砥中正式加入蒋贼特务组织。特务组织给他的任务是：搜集国内军事、政治、工业建设等情报和发展特务组织。三月二十日，王犯公开潜入了广东省建筑工程局设计公司，任一级技术员。
    王犯潜入设计公司后，即积极搜集各种情报，发展特务组织，进行技术性破坏。
    王犯搜集情报的方式是多种多样的。他利用本身职务，积累自己经办的各种工程设计情况，并从兴建单位的机关干部中刺探内部情况；他还利用设计公司制度不严和某些干部思想麻痹等缺点，偷看公司承办的其他工程设计图样；通过外调技术人员，以交流经验为名，用通讯方式探悉其他地区的建筑设施。他并指示被发展了的特务分子搜集其他部门的情报。王犯先后搜集了我军事、政治、工程等各方面的情报共达二十多件，秘密送往香港蒋贼特务机关。
    王犯在机关内部发展特务组织的方式是拉拢一些旧同学和自己较接近的“新同事”，利用闲谈方式，散布腐化堕落思想，以进行所谓“心战”；并从闲谈中了解每个人的历史、出身和思想上的弱点，以投其所好，相机利用收买或拉入特务组织。王犯在机关内部发展组织的阴谋未能实现，便转向外部秘密发展。王砥中通过设计公司技术员周绳禧的关系，认识了周绳禧的父亲周乃士（私营“合联”营造厂经理）。王犯了解周乃士是一个反动军官，一九五三年因盗窃国家财产罪行被判处两年徒刑，对政府不满。王犯就利用介绍工程生意进行拉拢煽动，吸收周犯参加特务组织。王犯以同样方式，另外拉拢了梁全福和赵秉衡加入特务组织。
    利用技术破坏国家建设工程也是王犯反革命罪恶计划的一个组成部分。他的破坏方法，一是拖延交出设计图样的时间，破坏设计公司和兴建单位签订的合同；一是绘制错误的设计，漏注尺寸，漏绘大样，编乱号码，或使基础承载力不足，工程自行沉陷裂缝，企图达到返工浪费损失国家资财的罪恶目的。在他经办的所有设计工程中都有不同程度的破坏行为。王犯在负责广东省气象局办公楼的建筑工程中，暗中把连续梁的钢筋减少了三分之一，安装了防雨性能很差的而又有裂缝的预制楼板数十张，后经兴建单位查觉，才避免了损失。
    广东省人民法院根据罪犯罪行，依法判处王砥中、周乃士、梁全福死刑，赵秉衡十五年徒刑。
