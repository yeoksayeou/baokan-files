Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an article from Paris by Lasakin and Berezinsky on the 15th, stating: "In recent days, the diplomatic activities of the three Western countries in Paris to prepare for the Geneva Conference have entered an intense stage. In Paris, plans are being drafted by the three Western governments for the Geneva Conference."

These plans have not yet been published, but there have been many rumors talking about the so-called "Stassen Plan" on disarmament that American diplomats are currently drafting. It is said that strenuous efforts have been made to revise the "Eden Plan," which was previously proposed at the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the procedures for elections in Germany.

What draws people's attention is that Western commentators are trying to limit the issue to the procedures for all-German elections, while setting aside the question of how to ensure that a reunified Germany is a peace-loving and democratic country and will never again become a victim of Hitler-style militarists and revanchists.

An important thing worth noting is that, in view of public opinion, the French government has announced that it hopes to achieve certain results at the Geneva Four-Power Conference. French Prime Minister Faure said in a statement to reporters that in the current international situation, "we should turn our eyes to the future rather than the past" and "we should seek to agree on the principles of future action."

The reporters finally said: The general public in France expects the Geneva Four-Power Summit to make significant contributions to resolving basic international problems and easing international tensions. They expect all parties participating in the meeting to show that they are truly prepared for negotiation, mutual understanding, and respect for national interests. No man or woman in France wants the upcoming meeting to fail.

### 苏联“真理报”发表文章  评西方三国在四国首脑会议前夕的活动

    苏联“真理报”发表文章
    评西方三国在四国首脑会议前夕的活动
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十五日刊载了拉萨金和别列津斯基从巴黎发来的文章说：这些天来，三个西方国家在巴黎为日内瓦会议进行准备的外交活动已经进入紧张阶段。在巴黎，人们正在拟定三个西方国家的政府对日内瓦会议的计划。
    这些计划都还没有公布，但是已经有许多传闻，谈到美国外交人员现在正在拟定的关于裁军的所谓“史塔生计划”。据说，已经进行了紧张的努力来修改以前在柏林外长会议上提出的关于在德国举行选举的程序的“艾登计划”。
    引起人们注意的是：西方评论员们竭力要把问题局限在全德选举的程序问题上面，而对于怎样来保证一个重新统一的德国是一个爱好和平和民主的国家而且永远不再成为希特勒式的军国主义者和复仇主义者的牺牲品的问题，却撇开不谈。
    值得注意的重要事情是：法国政府鉴于公众的意见，已经宣布它希望在日内瓦四大国会议上取得某些结果。法国总理富尔在向记者发表的一篇声明中说，在目前的国际局势下，“应当把眼睛转向将来而不是过去”，并且“应当谋求就未来的行动达成协议的原则”。
    记者们最后说：法国社会一般人士期望日内瓦四国最高级会议在解决基本的国际问题和缓和国际紧张局势方面作出重大贡献。他们期望参加会议的各方面表明是真正准备谈判、相互谅解和尊重民族利益的。法国任何男女都不希望即将举行的会议失败。
