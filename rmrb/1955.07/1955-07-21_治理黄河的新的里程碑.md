A New Milestone in the Governance of the Yellow River
Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of Water Resources

At the Second Session of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier Deng Zihui delivered a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Controlling Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Conservancy" on behalf of the State Council. This plan is a new milestone in the history of Yellow River governance.

The Chinese people have been harnessing the Yellow River for thousands of years. Through their tenacious struggle against floods, the vast population of the Yellow River basin has continuously enriched their experience in river management. Legend has it that Yu the Great controlled the floods by means of dredging, dividing the river into nine branches in the northeastern part of the lower plains to weaken the water's force. Wang Jing of the Han Dynasty managed the river (69 AD) by building dikes, protecting banks, and dredging. Jia Lu of the Yuan Dynasty managed the river (1351 AD) by diverting various river branches, deepening the silted channels, blocking breaches, and consolidating embankments (the so-called "dredging, diverting, and blocking" methods). By the time of Pan Jixun's governance of the Yellow River in the Ming Dynasty (around 1565-1592), the role of dike construction was further enhanced. He advocated "blocking breaches to correct the main flow, using dikes to constrain the water, and using water to scour sediment." This meant maintaining an integrated channel, avoiding diversion, and keeping the distance between dikes narrow to concentrate the flow, scour away sediment, and prevent channel silting. Dike construction in the Ming Dynasty was divided into four types: distant dikes, secondary dikes, grid dikes, and crescent dikes. Secondary dikes were close to the river, meant to constrain the flow and scour sediment. Crescent dikes were built inside the secondary dikes as a forward defense, preventing the flow from directly impacting the secondary dikes. Distant dikes were outside the secondary dikes, serving as a second line of defense. Grid dikes were built between distant and secondary dikes to prevent the flow from following the distant dikes after a breach in the secondary dikes, avoiding the formation of a new channel. In addition, meticulous dike defense and maintenance methods were established.

The characteristics of the Yellow River are rapid flood surges and declines, meaning that the water rises very high but does not last long, and after a short period of decline, another surge may occur. Secondly, the Yellow River carries a large amount of sediment, and east of Mengjin, the flow gradually slows, causing channel silting. In response to these natural conditions, to reduce the force of the water as it enters the plains from the mountains, and to prevent the channel from silting up too quickly, the ancient people adopted a wide dike distance in the section of Henan Province. Below Zhengzhou, the distance between the two dikes is generally more than ten kilometers, about twenty kilometers in the Jiahetan area, and gradually narrows east of Lanfeng. This wide channel serves as a lake to reduce the force of sudden surges and regulate floods in normal years. In addition, when the water rises and overflows the滩 (tān, flood plains), the flow slows, and sediment can settle on the banks. A wide dike distance means a wide滩 (tān), a broad sedimentation area, and slower channel silting. Thus, a wide dike distance in the upper section can retain floods and reduce silt, while a narrow dike distance in the lower section can constrain the water to scour sediment.

Protecting dikes from erosion by the flow was also a concern in ancient Yellow River management. Stone revetments existed early on. The stone dikes mentioned in Jia Rang's strategy for Yellow River management in the Han Dynasty (7 BC) is an example. The History of Song Dynasty, Records of Rivers and Canals, states: "In the second year of Chunhua during the reign of Emperor Taizong (991 AD), patrol envoys were appointed to inspect the river dikes." 埽 (sào) refers to bank protection made of branches, reeds, straw, or grass. This method is still used in some places today.

The method of overflow was also adopted early on to defend against extraordinary Yellow River floods. The减水坝 (jiǎn shuǐ bà, flood reduction dams) built on the dikes during Pan Jixun's governance of the Yellow River in the Ming Dynasty are similar to modern overflow weirs or diversion weirs, allowing overflow through the dams when the water rises to a certain level and there is a risk of dike overflow and breach. Several flood reduction dams built during the Qing Dynasty still remain on the Hongze Lake dike.

Although the ancient people had many creations and accumulated much experience in governing the Yellow River, playing a certain role in ensuring agricultural production in the lower plains, the growth of river management experience and the effectiveness of its results were inevitably limited under feudal rule.

Feudal society's management of the Yellow River primarily protected the interests of landlords, nobles, and the imperial family. For example, the main purpose of Yellow River management in the Ming Dynasty was to maintain imperial court shipping and protect the imperial ancestral tombs. At that time, the Yellow River flowed south, passing through Xuzhou and Huaiyin, and entering the sea through the Huai River at Yuntiguan. The Ming ancestral tombs were northeast of Sizhou, between the Yellow River and the Huai River; the imperial tombs were in Fengyang, south of the Huai River (see Illustrations of Ancestral Tombs and Imperial Tombs). Yellow River flooding would encroach on the Ming ancestral tombs. Therefore, protecting the ancestral tombs became a primary task of Yellow River management. At that time, the Ming Dynasty had its capital in Beijing, and north-south transportation mainly relied on the Grand Canal. The section of the Grand Canal from Huaian north to Xuzhou used the Yellow River for passage. Therefore, the Ming Dynasty's management of the Yellow River was also for the purpose of unblocking the canal, preventing it from blocking navigation, and transporting grain to supply the ruling base. Pan Jixun stated in his memorial "Stopping the Dormant Inspection of the Zijiaying Project": "Ancestral tombs must be protected, the canal is concerning, the lives of a million people in Huai are in imminent danger," pointing out the three major goals of river management at that time. Pan Jixun also discussed the Henan Province project in his memorial "Clearly Explaining Henan Repair and Defense": "Because it is not a place traversed by the shipping route, and cannot be directly observed, people believe there is no danger, but how can they know that the water comes from the upper reaches and will harm the shipping route?" He suggested that the dike projects in Henan Province should also be repaired and defended, and said that if attention is not paid, it will hinder the shipping route that the ruling class cares about. Thus, it is clear that the main concerns of the Ming Dynasty's Yellow River management were ancestral tombs and the shipping route to the capital.

Secondly, feudal society's management of the Yellow River was fragmented, forming a separatist situation. For example, the irrigation east of the Helan Mountains and south of the Wolf Mountains and Wula Mountains, as well as the irrigation of the Jing River and Wei River, had a long history and achieved results, but were all fragmented and varied in prosperity and decline over time. The main river management work was mostly limited to the lower plains. This section of the river was sometimes managed by special officials and sometimes concurrently by local officials. Even within this section, there were often conflicts between upstream and downstream, left and right banks, and various regions, preventing unified management. In the fifth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty (1855 AD), the Yellow River breached at Tongwaxiang and flowed north. At that time, Li Hongzhang of Anhui, representing the opinions of Anhui and Jiangsu, disagreed with blocking the breach and advocated that the Yellow River flow north from the breach. Shandong Governor Ding Baozhen, representing Shandong's opinion, demanded that the breach be blocked and advocated that the Yellow River return to its old course. The two sides disagreed, and for twenty years, neither the breach was blocked nor dikes were built in Shandong, causing the floodwater to spread. Another example is when the river breached at Huzi during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (132 BC). At this time, Marquis of Wu'an, Tian Fen, was prime minister. His official income came from 鄃 (Shū), which was north of the Yellow River. When the Yellow River breached south, 鄃 (Shū) was spared the threat of disaster and had a bumper harvest. Tian Fen told the emperor: "River breaches are all acts of Heaven, not easily blocked by human force, and blocking them may not comply with Heaven," so the breach was not blocked for a long time. "Using neighbors as a sinkhole" was the inevitable result of this society. After the Yellow River changed course in 1855, there were also great contradictions in the river defense of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. If the Yellow River breached east of Lanfeng County in Henan Province and on the south bank of Hebei Province, the affected areas would mainly be in Shandong Province. Although Shandong Province was very concerned about the river defense in these two regions, it could not manage beyond its borders. Therefore, the dikes in this section could not be well maintained and defended, becoming an area prone to breaches.

Due to the limitations of feudal society, the people fought the Yellow River for thousands of years, but ultimately did not change the Yellow River's characteristics of "prone to silting, prone to breaching, and prone to shifting." According to historical records, the lower reaches of the Yellow River breached and flooded more than 1,500 times in more than 3,000 years, and changed course drastically 26 times. This number alone shows the severity of the Yellow River disaster. People love this region that has nurtured our national history, conquering and utilizing the Yellow River day after day for thousands of years, but they have also lived in frequent disasters.

After the Opium War in 1840, foreign capitalism invaded China, and modern science was introduced along with it, and river management strategies also changed. However, in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, only the methods of feudal society were inherited, and nothing was added to the measures for dike construction in the lower reaches. The changes in strategy were also limited to discussions on paper.

Some technical personnel from capitalist countries have also put forward opinions on governing the Yellow River. However, neither Freeman from the United States nor Engels and Fangxius from Germany had studied the development of the Yellow River dike line, and they did not have enough understanding of the nature of the Yellow River flow and sediment. Therefore, they failed to put forward opinions on eradicating the Yellow River, and even their suggestions on dike construction in the lower reaches were mostly unrealistic.

The first person to propose a radical solution to the problem of floods and sediment in the lower reaches was Li Yizhi, a famous Chinese water conservancy expert. In 1931, he advocated "Guiding the Yellow River should focus on the upper reaches." The management method he advocated was to prevent sediment from flowing into the river channel, especially emphasizing the extensive opening of ditches and gullies on the Loess Plateau in the Northwest, building many valley weirs in the gullies; building reservoirs on the tributaries in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces to block excess floods; and fixing the downstream river channel with medium water as the standard. Li Yizhi's advocacy advanced China's river management strategy by a big step, opening a new page in the history of river management. The ancients also knew the source of the Yellow River disasters, such as Chen Huang during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty (around 1677) said: The main stream of the Yellow River is very long, and the amount of water flowing in is also large, so the water is turbulent; the soil in the northwest is loose, and when it encounters turbulent water, it flows down with the water, so the river water becomes turbid; when it reaches the lower reaches, the river water is turbid and easy to silt, and silting is easy to cause breaches. However, scientific technology was not developed at that time, and the method of building reservoirs could not be proposed. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty (around 1743), Hu Ding also had a suggestion to block sand in the northwest, saying: Most of the sediment in the Yellow River comes from the gullies above Sanmen and in the Zhongtiao Mountains of Shanxi. Please build dams at the mouths of each gully to block them. In times of heavy water, the sediment will silt up in the gullies, gradually forming a flat land that can be planted with autumn wheat. Chinese farmers also have rich experience in preventing soil erosion, which is still widely circulated. Li Yizhi accepted China's old experience and imported science, and made great contributions to the development of river management strategies. However, his advocacy could not be realized in the society at that time, so it was limited to discussion.

After the Japanese imperialists launched the war of aggression against China in 1937, they also made a preliminary plan for governing the Yellow River in order to obtain China's hydropower resources. The main content of this plan was hydropower generation, which was used to develop Japanese imperialist industry in China; the water flow was used to irrigate the farmland in the lower plains only after the power generation was utilized at all levels. Because the water storage of each reservoir mainly took into account power generation, the regulation amount for other uses was low, the irrigated area was not large, and the control of flood prevention was not enough. Regardless of the technical shortcomings of this plan, its essence was a complete colonial plan, which only considered using China's water energy, developing China's mineral resources, and developing imperialist industry, and did not consider the lives of farmers in the Yellow River basin at all.

I personally also put forward opinions on governing the Yellow River in my early years. At that time, I believed that developing agriculture was the main thing. The Balihutong Reservoir and Sanmenxia Reservoir that were proposed were mainly for flood prevention, and other reservoirs were mainly for irrigation. The generated electricity was also advocated to be used more for water lifting irrigation and fertilizer production. This opinion was exactly the opposite of the Japanese strategy of mainly generating electricity. However, because my understanding of agriculture was very superficial, and more importantly, I underestimated industry, my opinion on governing the Yellow River at that time was also one-sided.

In the spring of 1947, the so-called "Yellow River Governance Advisory Group" of the United States also drafted a plan. This plan was even more like child's play. The three Americans in the advisory group looked at the Yellow River on an airplane and sent out a report on the plan. The absurdity of this plan can be seen from how one of its specific opinions was obtained. The "On-the-spot Investigation" section of the report said: "On January 1, 1947, we flew from Xi'an back to Kaifeng, flying along the river, paying special attention to checking the Balihutong dam site. Based on the impression of the aerial observation, we believe that a high dam should be built." Just imagine: they had never been to Balihutong, and there was very little information about Balihutong at that time, so how could they decide the dam site? This was completely fooling people.

After the Opium War, although there was some progress in river management strategies, the sources and laws of water flow and sediment began to be studied, and some work was done on hydrological observation and topographic surveying, and these works were gradually extended to the upper, middle, and tributary reaches of the Yellow River. However, there was no progress in the actual work of governing the Yellow River; especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Yellow River was even more harmful.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, it became possible to radically control the Yellow River. The people's government led the masses to carry out huge work to ensure that the lower reaches of the Yellow River would not breach and change course. The 1,365-kilometer-long dikes on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yellow River have been expanded over the years, and the height of the dike top in Henan Province exceeds the 1933 flood level by 2 to 3 meters, and the height of the dike top in Shandong Province exceeds the 1949 flood level by 2 to 2.5 meters, adding more than 100 million cubic meters of earthwork. Not only has the height and thickness of the dike body increased, but the quality of the dike has also been improved. In the past, the dike body was really full of holes. After years of efforts, more than 58 million cone probes have been made, and more than 79,000 holes and cracks have been filled. These holes and cracks vary in size. The animal burrows are 6 decimeters in diameter and 100 meters long, and the cracks are 4 decimeters wide and more than 20 meters long. The holes dug by people buried in the dike are more than 1 meter wide and 30 meters long. These are all hidden dangers of the Yellow River, and are the reasons why it collapsed before the river water could even reach the top of the dike in the past. In addition, the straw revetments close to the water in the past have now been completely replaced by stone revetments. The 3 million cubic meters of stonework and brickwork have greatly enhanced the ability to defend against the impact of floods.

Although these measures have strengthened the material foundation for flood prevention, they are not enough to eliminate the threat of floods. Therefore, a flood overflow weir was built near Shitou Village on the left bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County to divert part of the flood, flowing through the area between the left bank dike and the Jin Dike as a flood storage area to reduce the flow of the main river. The confluence of the Qin River and the Yellow River and Dongping Lake in Shandong Province were also used as flood storage areas for temporary storage of floods. A凌汛 (líng xùn, ice flood) overflow weir was also built near Xiaojiezi on the right bank of the Yellow River in Lijin County for diversion in case of ice dam blockage. These are all extraordinary flood prevention measures.

In addition to strong dikes and extraordinary measures, there are also regular maintenance, defense, and temporary defense work during high water periods. Regular work is undertaken by regularly established institutions and engineering teams. Flood prevention work is organized temporarily to strengthen leadership, and a flood prevention reserve team is established to be on the dikes in case of emergency during large floods. This organization is strict and effective, and has played a great role in flood prevention over the years. Taking 1952 as an example, the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters was established during the high water period, and three provincial headquarters (there was also Pingyuan Province at that time), ten special zone headquarters, forty-six county headquarters, one hundred and fifty district-village headquarters, five hundred and eighty-two township headquarters, and six thousand seven hundred and seventy-four village headquarters were established. In terms of mobilizing the masses, a flood prevention army of 579,000 people, including flood prevention workers, rescue teams, transportation teams, and reserve teams, was organized, and tools and materials for rescue were prepared. This flood prevention organization and the material foundation for flood prevention have become favorable conditions for winning the fight against floods.

These measures have ensured that the Yellow River, which has an average of one breach and flood every two years for more than 3,000 years, has safely passed the 伏秋 (fú qiū, summer and autumn) flood season in these years since the people have seized power, ensuring the safety of the lives of the people in the lower reaches and the harvest of crops.

However, these preliminary results of Yellow River management are not enough to eradicate floods and further utilize the resources of the Yellow River to meet the needs of socialist construction. In the past, many people thought that the Yellow River was a "spendthrift," and they would be satisfied if they could get rid of the disasters and quickly lead the water into the sea. However, they did not know that water is also a valuable resource that can be utilized. Especially the Yellow River, whether from a natural or economic point of view, has huge development value. Only in the new China can the ideal of completely transforming the Yellow River, turning the harmful river into a beneficial river, be realized. In order to realize the people's demand for the Yellow River to be "fully utilized for its benefits and its harms completely eliminated," in order to develop the Yellow River, to benefit the country, especially the development of industry and agriculture in the interior, large-scale survey, measurement, and research work has been carried out in the past few years. Finally, with the help of Soviet experts, the comprehensive utilization plan of the Yellow River was compiled, the most advanced strategy for governing the Yellow River was determined, and the infinitely beautiful vision was planned.

The Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan determines that the water flow and land resources in the Yellow River basin should be utilized rationally economically and correctly technically to serve all sectors of the national economy. Therefore, the working area will not be limited to the lower reaches or any part, but will be based on the entire basin, including the main and tributary streams and land. The purpose of the work will not only be for flood prevention or any single use, but will be comprehensively developed, that is, to serve various projects of the national economy. The requirement of the work will not only be to seek technical feasibility, but also to achieve economic rationality. The method of work is not to advance all tasks equally, but to proceed in an orderly manner according to the national economic plan, with priority given to the important and urgent tasks. This river management strategy determined from the perspective of the entire national economic plan is impossible for capitalist societies that only seek profit, and it is also impossible for feudal societies that are decentralized, divided, and technically backward. Therefore, our current Yellow River governance strategy is the most advanced, belongs to the socialist type, and is also the most perfect strategy in the history of Yellow River governance.

The Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan, in terms of soil improvement, that is, in terms of using irrigation to increase agricultural production, plans to fully utilize the water sources of the Yellow River main stream and tributaries. According to technical investigations, this is possible, and the amount of land in the Yellow River basin and its neighboring areas that needs and can be irrigated is extremely large, and even after the Yellow River water source is fully regulated, it will not be enough to irrigate these lands. The Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan has made several different irrigation plans according to the long-term economic development of each province and soil conditions, stipulating the total irrigation area and the area of different regions; it also considers the possibility of water diversion buildings, and the favorable coordination of water flow in other uses. As for the land that cannot be irrigated with Yellow River water, other sources of groundwater or other rivers must be found.

Secondly, in terms of water energy utilization, the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan, according to the industrial development prospects in the next three five-year plans of the Yellow River basin and its neighboring areas, according to the study of hydrological, topographic, and geological survey data and the comparison of various dam sites, and with reference to the calculation of water flow utilization, has formulated a ladder development plan for the Yellow River main stream. The so-called ladder development is to build a series of dams on the river to make the river look like a ladder, using the dams to store water, raise the water head, and generate electricity. Several of these dams create large reservoirs in different regions to regulate the water flow. Large reservoirs are the key measures for comprehensive development. They can not only block and store water to supply irrigation and power generation, but also regulate floods and avoid water disasters.

Again, in terms of shipping, according to economic needs and the progress of other water conservancy projects, the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan has formulated the development layout of Yellow River shipping.

Finally, in order to reduce the siltation of reservoirs, and to increase the agricultural production of the Loess Plateau, after studying the laws of soil erosion and its economic impact, and studying the water and soil conservation experience of farmers and the achievements of experimental stations in various places, the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan has formulated measures to prevent soil erosion and block sediment, and estimated the reduction of erosion and the increase in agricultural production within fifteen years.

Based on the long-term plan formulated by this research, combined with the current needs and possibilities, the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan further formulated the first phase of various measures for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River. After the completion of the first phase of the project, the threat of Yellow River floods can be basically eliminated, and favorable conditions will be created for various uses.

Although the Chinese people have a long history of governing the Yellow River and have accumulated rich experience, only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Soviet Union, have we found the most correct way to govern the Yellow River. We are determined to overcome all difficulties and strive to realize the tasks stipulated in the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan.

    治理黄河的新的里程碑
    水利部副部长　张含英
    在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，邓子恢副总理代表国务院作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。这个规划是治理黄河历史上的一个新的里程碑。
    我国人民整治黄河有数千年的历史。历代黄河流域的广大人民通过同洪水的顽强斗争，不断地丰富了治河的经验。相传大禹治水用疏导的方法，在下游大平原的东北部把河分为九股，以杀水势。汉朝王景治河（公元六九年）采取了修堤、护岸和疏浚的方法。元朝贾鲁治河（公元一三五一年）用分导各股河流、浚深淤塞河道、堵塞决口并巩固堤岸等方法（就是所谓疏、浚、塞三法）。到了明朝潘季驯治河（约在公元一五六五——一五九二年间），更提高了修堤的作用。他主张“塞旁决以挽正流，以堤束水，以水攻沙”。就是说要维持一个整一的河道，不要分疏，堤距不要太宽，以便于集中水流，冲去泥沙，免使河槽淤淀。明朝修堤已分遥堤、缕堤、格堤、月堤四种。缕堤近河，用以约束水流，意在束水攻沙。缕堤以内又筑月堤，作为前卫，以免水流直冲缕堤。遥堤在缕堤以外，作为第二道防线。遥堤和缕堤水间又筑格堤，为的是缕堤决口以后，防止水流顺遥堤而下，免致冲成河道。此外，还制定了缜密的防堤制度和修守方法。
    黄河的特点是洪水涨落很快，也就是说，水涨很高，但持时不久，水落不久以后，可能又有一次涨水。其次是黄河携带大量泥沙，孟津而东，水流渐缓，因而淤淀河身。针对这种自然情况，为了消杀从山区刚进入平原的水势，为了不使河槽淤高太快，古代人民在河南省的一段采取了宽堤距的办法。自郑州而下，两堤相距一般在十公里以上，在夹河滩一带宽约二十公里；至兰封以东才逐渐收缩。这段宽河槽便成为消杀猛涨的湖泊，可以调节一般年的洪水。此外，水涨漫滩，漫滩流缓，泥沙便可以沉淀在两岸的滩上，堤距远，河滩宽，沉淀的范围广，河槽的淤高也慢了。由此可见，上段的宽堤距可以滞洪落淤，下段的窄堤距可以束水攻沙。
    保护临河的堤，免受水流的冲刷，也是我国人民治河中早已注意的问题。我国很早就有石护岸。汉朝贾让治河策（公元前七年）所说的石堤即是一例。宋史河渠志载：“太宗淳化二年（公元九九一年）设巡河主埽使臣，巡视河堤”。埽，就是用梢、苇、秸或草所制的护岸。这种方法直到现在还有些地方在采用。
    我国很早以前，也已采用溢流的办法，防御黄河的非常洪水。明朝潘季驯治河时在堤上修的减水坝，就颇似现代的溢洪堰或分水堰，在水涨到一定高度而有漫堤决口的危险时，可以由减水坝溢流。洪泽湖大堤上现在还留着清朝所修的几座减水坝。
    古代人民治理黄河虽然有许多创造，积累了许多经验，对于下游大平原的农业生产起了一定的保障作用，但是在封建统治下，治河经验的成长和所得的效果，是不能不受到限制的。
    封建社会治理黄河是以保护地主、贵族、皇室的利益为主的。例如明朝治理黄河主要就是为了维持皇朝航运和保护皇族祖陵。那时黄河走南道，经徐州、淮阴、夺淮河自云梯关入海。明朝祖陵在泗州东北，黄河和淮河之间；皇陵在凤阳，在淮河以南（见祖陵图说及皇陵图）。黄河泛滥便侵及明朝祖陵。所以保护祖陵便成为治理黄河的一个主要任务。当时明朝建都北京，南北交通主要依靠运河，而运河自淮安以北到徐州的一段是借黄河通行的，所以明朝治黄河又是为了沟通运河，不使阻塞航道，以便运输粮食，供给统治的大本营。潘季驯在“停寝訾家营工疏”的奏章里说道：“祖陵当护，运河可虑，淮民百万，危在旦夕。”指出了当时治河的三大目的。潘季驯又在“申明河南修守疏”奏章里论及河南省的工程，说道：“缘非运道经行之处，耳目所不及见，人遂以为无虞，而岂知水从上源出，运道必伤。”建议对河南省的堤工也应加以修理防守，并且说如果不加注意，将妨碍统治阶级所关心的运道。由此可见明朝治黄主要考虑的是祖陵、是通向京城的运道。
    其次，封建社会治理黄河是分散的，成为割据的形势。例如黄河在贺兰山以东和狼山、乌拉山以南的灌溉，以及泾河和渭河的灌溉，都有悠久的历史和成效，但都是分散的，且随着时代而有盛衰。至于主要的治河工作，大都限于下游大平原，这段河道有时设专官管理，有时由地方官兼管。就在这一段内也常有上下游、左右岸以及各地区间的矛盾，不能得到统一的治理。清咸丰五年（公元一八五五年）黄河从铜瓦厢决口北流。当时安徽的李鸿章代表安徽、江苏的意见不同意堵口，主张黄河从决口向北流。山东巡抚丁宝桢代表山东的意见要求堵决口，主张黄河归故道。双方争执不下，在二十年间，既没有堵口，也没有在山东修堤，致使决水泛滥横流。又如汉武帝元光时候（公元前一三二年），河在瓠子决口。这时武安侯田蚡为丞相，他作官的收入来自鄃，鄃在黄河北边。黄河向南决了，鄃地免除了灾害的威胁，收成丰足。田蚡对皇帝说：“江河之决皆天事，未易以人力疆塞，塞之未必应天”，所以很久没有堵口。“以邻为壑”乃是这种社会里必然的结果。一八五五年黄河改道以后，河南、河北、山东三省的河防也存在很大的矛盾。如果黄河在河南省兰封县以东和河北省的南岸决堤，受灾的地区主要在山东省。山东省对这两个地区的河防虽然很关心，却不能越境治理。因之，这一段的堤防便不能很好地培修和防守，成为决口频繁的地区。
    由于封建社会的限制，人民和黄河斗争了几千年，终究没有改变黄河“善淤、善决、善徙”的性格。根据历史文献的记载，黄河下游在三千多年中决口泛滥一千五百多次，大改道迁徙二十六次。单从这个数字，就可以知道黄河灾情的严重。人民喜欢这个孕育我们民族历史的地区，数千年如一日地征服黄河、利用黄河，但也一直生活在频繁的灾害中。
    一八四○年鸦片战争以后，外国资本主义侵入我国，随着也输进了现代科学，治河的策略也有所改变。但是在半封建、半殖民地的社会里，也只有因袭封建社会的办法，仍然在下游从事堤防，措施上毫无增添。策略的改变，也只限于纸上的谈论。
    有一些资本主义国家的技术人员，也曾提出过治理黄河的意见。但无论是美国的费礼门、德国的恩格斯和方修斯都没有研究过黄河堤线的发展，对黄河水流及泥沙的性质也不够了解，所以他们没有能提出根治黄河的意见，即便是对下游修堤的建议也多偏于空想。
    第一个针对为患下游的洪水和泥沙的来源而提出根治黄河意见的人，是我国著名的水利专家李仪祉。他在一九三一年倡议“导治黄河宜注重上游”。他主张的治理方法是防止泥沙流入河道，尤其着重在西北黄土高原上广开沟洫，沟壑里多修谷坊；在山西、陕西、河南各省支流修水库，以拦蓄过量的洪水；固定下游河槽，以中水为准则。李仪祉的主张使我国治河策略向前推进了一大步，为治河史上开一新页。古人也知道黄河灾害的来源，如清康熙间（约在一六七七年左右）陈璜说：黄河的干流很长，流入的水也多，所以水势汹涌湍急；西北的土性松浮，遇到湍急的水流，便随水而下，所以河水变浊；到了下游，因河水浊而易淤，淤就容易使河决。但是那时的科学技术还不发达，提不出修水库的办法。清乾隆间（约在一七四三年左右）胡定也有在西北拦沙的建议，他说：黄河的泥沙大多来自三门以上和山西中条山一带的沟涧里，请在各沟涧口修筑坝堰拦阻，大水时，泥沙淤留在沟涧里，渐成一块平地，可以种秋麦。我国农民也有丰富的防御土壤冲蚀的经验，到现在还广泛地流传着。李仪祉接受了我国旧有的经验和输入的科学，对于治河策略的发展有很大贡献。但他的主张在当时的社会里是不能实现的，因此也只限于谈论。
    一九三七年日本帝国主义发动侵华战争后，为谋获取我国水力资源，也曾作过治理黄河的初步计划。这个计划的主要内容是水力发电，用以发展日本帝国主义在华的工业；水流在各级发电利用之后，才灌溉下游平原的农田。由于各水库的蓄水主要照顾到发电，所以对于其它利用的调节量较低，灌溉面积不多，而对于防洪的控制也不够。姑不论这个计划在技术上的缺点，单就它的本质说，是一个十足的殖民地计划，只考虑利用我国的水能，开发我国的矿藏，发展帝国主义的工业，丝毫没有考虑黄河流域农民的生活。
    我个人早年也曾提出过治理黄河的意见，那时我认为发展农业是主要的。所建议的八里胡同水库和三门峡水库便以防洪为主，其他水库则多以灌溉为主，所发电力也主张多用于提水灌溉和制造肥料。这个意见和日本人以发电为主的策略恰恰相反。但由于我对农业的认识很肤浅，更重要的是轻视了工业，所以当时我对治理黄河的意见也是片面的。
    一九四七年春天，美国所谓“治黄顾问团”也拟了一个计划。这个计划更是形同儿戏。顾问团的三个美国人，乘飞机在黄河上看了一下，就送出关于这个计划的报告。这个计划的荒唐，单从它的一项具体意见是怎样得来的，就可以看出来。报告里的“实地查勘”节下说：“一九四七年一月一日，自西安乘机返开封，沿河飞行，特别注意查看八里胡同坝址，就空中观察之印象，认为宜建高坝。”试想：他们从没有到过八里胡同，那时关于八里胡同的资料也很少，怎么能决定坝址呢？这完全是愚弄人。
    鸦片战争以后，虽然在治河策略上有所推进，也开始研究水流和泥沙的来源和规律，对于水文观测和地形测量作了些工作，并且逐渐把这些工作推广到黄河的上游、中游和支流上去。但在治理黄河的实际工作上毕竟没有什么进展；特别是在国民党反动统治时代，黄河为害更甚。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，才有了根治黄河的可能。人民政府领导群众首先为求得黄河下游不致于决口改道进行了巨大的工作。黄河下游两岸长一千三百六十五公里的大堤，经过历年的培修，堤顶高度，在河南省境超过一九三三年洪水位二至三公尺，在山东省境超过一九四九年洪水位二至二·五公尺，共添加土工一亿多立方公尺。不特堤身高度和厚度增加了，堤的质量也提高了。过去的堤身真是千疮百孔，经过几年来的努力，共锥探五千八百多万眼，填塞洞穴、裂缝七万九千多个。这些洞穴和裂缝大小不等，动物的洞有的直径六公寸，长一百公尺，裂缝有的宽四公寸，长二十多公尺，已埋在堤内的人挖的洞有的宽一公尺多，长三十公尺。这些，都是黄河的隐患，是过去河水还淹不到堤顶时就溃决的原因。此外，过去临水的秸埽现在已经全部改为石护岸，三百万立方公尺的石工和砖工，大大地增强了防御洪水冲击的力量。
    这些措施虽然加强了防御洪水的物质基础，但还不能消除洪水的威胁，所以又在长垣县境黄河左岸石头庄附近修了一道溢洪堰，分泄一部分洪水，流经左岸大堤和金堤之间作为滞洪区，以减少正河流量。并把沁河同黄河交会处和山东省的东平湖作为蓄洪区，以为临时分蓄洪水之用。又在利津县境黄河右岸小街子附近修有凌汛溢水堰，为在冰坝壅塞时分流之用。这都是防水的非常措施。
    坚强的堤防和非常的措施以外，还有经常的保护工作、防守工作和大水期间的临时防御工作。经常的工作由经常设立的机关和工程队担任。防汛工作则有临时组织，以加强领导，并设立防汛预备队，以便在大汛期间遇有紧急情况时上堤。这种组织严密有效，对于历年防御洪水起了很大的作用。以一九五二年为例，在大水期间成立了黄河防汛总指挥部，又建立三个省指挥部（那时还有平原省），十个专区指挥部，四十六个县指挥部，一百五十个区村指挥部，五百八十二个乡指挥部，六千七百七十四个村指挥部。在发动群众方面，组织了一支包括防汛员、抢险队、运输队、预备队等五十七万九千人的防汛大军，并准备了工具和抢险用的料物。这种防水的组织和防水的物质基础便成为战胜洪水的有利条件。
    这些措施保证了三千多年来平均两年多有一次决口泛滥的黄河在人民掌握政权的这些年来平安地渡过伏秋汛期，保障了下游人民生活的安全和农作物的收成。
    但是，治理黄河的这些初步效果，并不足以根除水患，更不能进而利用黄河的资源，满足社会主义建设的需要。过去有很多人认为黄河是个“败家子”，只要能祛除灾害，赶快把水引到海里去就心满意足了。却不知水也是一种宝贵的资源，可以利用。特别是黄河，无论就自然条件或经济条件上看，都有巨大的开发价值。这种彻底改造黄河，把害河变为利河的理想，只有在新中国才能付之实现。为了实现人民对黄河“利必尽兴、害必根除”的要求，为了开发黄河，以利国家、特别是内地的工业和农业的发展，几年来进行了规模巨大的调查、测量和研究工作，最后在苏联专家的帮助下编制了黄河综合利用规划，确定了治理黄河的最先进的策略，规划了无限美好的远景。
    黄河综合利用规划确定要在经济上合理地、技术上正确地利用黄河流域中的水流和土地资源，为国民经济的各个部门服务。因之，工作的地区将不仅限于下游或任何一部分，而是以全流域为对象，包括干支流和土地。工作的目的将不仅为了防洪或任何一项利用，而是综合地开发，也就是服务于国民经济的各种项目。工作的要求将不仅是求得技术上的可能，而且必须达到经济上的合理。工作的方法不是各项工作平头前进，而是按照国民经济计划，分别轻重缓急，有次序地进行。这种从整个国民经济计划出发来确定的治河策略，是唯利是图的资本主义社会所不可能有的，也是分散、割据的，在技术上是落后的封建社会所不可能有的。因之，我们当前的治理黄河策略是最先进的，是属于社会主义类型的，也是在治理黄河历史上最完善的策略。
    黄河综合利用规划在土壤改良方面，也就是在利用灌溉以增加农业生产方面，预定对黄河干流和支流的水源要全部加以利用。根据技术上的调查，这是可能的，而且，黄河流域和它邻近地区需要并可能灌溉的土地数量极大，黄河水源全部调节后也还不够灌溉这些土地。黄河综合利用规划按照各省经济发展的远景情况和土壤条件，作了若干个不同灌溉方案，规定了灌溉总面积和不同地区的面积；同时也考虑到引水建筑物的可能性，以及水流在其它利用方面的有利配合。至于不能应用黄河水灌溉的土地，就须另找地下水或其它河流的水源。
    其次，在水能利用方面，黄河综合利用规划根据黄河流域和它邻近地区最近三个五年计划中的工业发展的远景，根据对水文、地形和地质勘测资料的研究和各个坝址的比较，参照水流利用的计算，拟定了黄河干流的阶梯开发方案。所谓阶梯开发，就是在河流上修一系列的拦河坝，把河身造成类似阶梯的形状，利用坝来蓄水、来抬高水头，来发电。其中有几个拦河坝在不同地区造成大蓄水库，以调节水流。大水库是综合开发的关键措施，它们不只可以拦蓄水流供给灌溉、发电各种利用，还可以调节洪水，避免水灾。
    再次，在航运方面，根据经济的需要和其它水利工程的进展，黄河综合利用规划拟定了黄河航运的开发布置。
    最后，为了减轻水库的淤积，为了增加黄土高原的农产，研究了水土流失的规律和它对于经济的影响，研究了农民水土保持的经验和各地实验站的成果，黄河综合利用规划拟定了防御土壤冲蚀和拦沙的措施，并估计了这项工作在十五年内冲蚀减轻情况和农产的增益情况。
    根据这样研究所拟定的远景方案，结合当前的需要和可能，黄河综合利用规划进一步制定出黄河综合利用的第一期各项措施。第一期工程完成后，就可以基本上解除黄河水灾的威胁，并为各项利用创造了有利的条件。
    中国人民治理黄河虽然有悠久的历史，积累了丰富的经验，但是只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在苏联的帮助下，我们才找到了治理黄河的最正确的道路。我们有决心克服一切困难，为实现黄河综合利用规划所规定的任务而奋斗。（附图片）
