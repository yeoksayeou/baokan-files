Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: The Chinese Yue Opera Troupe's tour performances in various parts of the German Democratic Republic have been warmly welcomed by the German people. Up to now, the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe has performed a total of fifteen shows, all of which were fully seated. The Chinese Yue Opera Troupe returned to Berlin on the 23rd.

During the sixteen days it was away from Berlin, the Yue Opera Troupe visited Karl-Marx-Stadt, a major industrial city in southern Democratic Germany, Weimar, the hometown of the world-renowned German writer Goethe and a German cultural center, as well as Cottbus and Altenburg. In these cities, they performed "The Story of the Western Wing" and "The Butterfly Lovers." No matter where these two famous Yue operas were performed, many audience members traveled from afar to watch. At the end of each act, the audience responded with long and enthusiastic applause. Wherever the Yue Opera Troupe went, many residents gathered around the actors and actresses for friendly conversations. Many factories and cultural organizations also presented gifts to the Yue Opera Troupe, expressing sincere welcome and as lasting mementos.

Leading comrades of local governments and representatives of the German art community in the German Democratic Republic, in their speeches for the Yue Opera Troupe's performances, emphasized the richness of the Chinese national cultural treasure and pointed out that this performance by the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe in the German Democratic Republic has made a significant contribution to enhancing the profound friendship and mutual understanding between the people of China and Germany.

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Berlin by air) The performances of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe in the German Democratic Republic have been highly valued and praised by people from all walks of life.

Art critic Hans-Jürgen Schäfer pointed out in one of his essays: "The expressive, elegant, and appropriate gestures of Yue Opera, and the dance-like brisk movements, make each performance perfect. Yue Opera vividly and clearly symbolizes every emotion to such an extent that the 'passion' in our European opera pales in comparison. Everywhere it maintains a delicate sentiment, everywhere it is proficient and skilled, harmonious, and always beautiful in a praiseworthy way." He believes that the impression Yue Opera gives the audience is unforgettable.

German writer Jens Gerlach described his impression this way: "The singing in Yue Opera is simply a complete outpouring of emotion. Its melodies shoot straight to the back row. Although people don't understand the language, they can understand everything. In an indivisible moment, it can make people's hearts feel boundless joy and infinite sorrow. What a masterpiece of art! I sat in my seat and instantly forgot everything around me. I laughed and cried. I appreciated perfect art that was so simple and true..." He then commented on the expressions and movements of Yue Opera: "Every expression is simple, but surprisingly detailed. An almost imperceptible gesture represents a meaningful expression. A slight movement reveals a plot, this slight movement seems to replace a long torrent of words. Unobtrusive and very moving light steps have the artistic effect of causing a burst of tension that makes people grieve deep into their hearts."

Dr. Karl Schneewolf, an art history expert, believes: "The performance method of Yue Opera has indisputable beauty and vivid expression. Its movement style is combined with realistic acting skills. The beautiful and meaningful hand gestures with silk robes and long sleeves, as well as the quiet steps while wearing half-boots, are excellently coordinated with lifelike acting skills."

German art critic Dr. Ernst Klufft also specially pointed out that the Yue Opera's "sets are magnificent and rich; the style of the costumes and the diversity of their colors have a fascinating power. Every scene is filled with the infectious brilliance of these sets and costumes. This ancient folk art, which has been carefully and modernly innovated and promoted by our friendly country, represented by Yue Opera, immediately dominates the hearts of the audience."

Even West Berlin's "Die Welt" praised the performance of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe. It said: "From an aesthetic point of view, Yue Opera has artistic magic." "Die Welt" emphasized the success of the entire Yue Opera performance. When discussing the musical effects and modern stage equipment of Yue Opera, the newspaper wrote: "The accompanying music of Yue Opera is completely understandable. Its melody is simple and infectious. Its music is a non-semitone pentatonic music, but rhythmically attractive. The audience will then silently follow along and sing."

    我越剧团在民主德国演出受到热烈欢迎
    新华社柏林二十五日电　中国越剧团在德意志民主共和国各地的巡回演出受到德国人民的热烈欢迎。到现在为止，中国越剧团一共演出了十五场，场场满座。中国越剧团已在二十三日回到柏林。
    越剧团在离开柏林的十六天中曾到过德意志民主共和国南部主要工业城市卡尔·马克思斯塔特、世界闻名的德国文学家哥德的故乡——德国文化中心魏玛以及科特布斯和阿尔登堡等城市，在这些城市中演出了“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”。这两出著名的越剧，不论在那里上演都有许多观众纷纷自远道赶来观剧。每场幕落，观众都报以长时间的热烈鼓掌。在越剧团所到之处，往往有许多居民围集在演员身旁，同他们作亲切的攀谈。许多工厂和文化团体还把礼物送给越剧团，表示真挚的欢迎和留作永远的纪念。
    德意志民主共和国各地政府领导同志和德国艺术界代表人物在为越剧团演出发表的讲话中都着重指出中国民族文化宝藏的丰富，并且指出这次中国越剧团在德意志民主共和国的演出，对增进中德两国人民深厚友谊和相互了解有重大贡献。
    本报柏林航讯　中国越剧团在德意志民主共和国的演出受到各界人士的重视和好评。
    艺术评论家汉思约根·谢弗在他的一篇论文中指出：“越剧的表情丰富的、幽雅的、恰如其分的姿势，舞蹈式的轻快动作，使场场都臻于完美。越剧把每种感情都维妙维肖地、明白地象征化了，它达到这样的程度，以致于我们欧洲歌剧里的“激情”在相形之下显得黯淡。处处保持着细腻的情调，处处是精通熟练的，是和谐的，是永远值得赞扬地那么美。”他认为越剧给观众的印象是永远难忘的。
    德国作家颜斯·盖拉赫这样描写他的印象：“越剧的歌唱简直是全部感情的通盘流露。它的旋律之箭，一直射到最后一排。人们虽然不通语言，然而能懂得一切。它能在无法分割的一瞬间内使人们的心坎感受到无比的欢欣和无限的悲痛。这是何等的艺术杰作！我坐在我的座位上，顿时忘却了周围的一切。我笑了又哭。我欣赏了完美的艺术，它是那样的简洁而真实……”他继而评论越剧的表情和动作：“每个表情都是简洁的，然而是惊人地细致。几乎觉察不出的一个手势，表示着意味深长的表情。轻轻的一动，道出了一段情节，这轻轻一动仿佛代替了一长篇滔滔不绝的道白。不引人注意而十分动人的轻轻步伐，具有引起一阵紧张心情的艺术效力，这种紧张心情会令人一直悲痛到心坎的深处。”
    艺术史专家卡尔·雪奈伏尔夫博士认为：“越剧的表演方法是具有无容置辩的优美和生动表情的，它的动作风格和现实主义的演技相结合。美观的含意深长的带有绸袍长袖的手部表情以及穿着半统靴时的娴静步伐，同逼真的演技十分出色地相互配合着。”
    德国艺术评论家恩斯特·克鲁夫特博士特别还指出越剧“布景辉煌富丽；服装的样式及其色彩的多样性有引人入胜的力量。场场都充满了这些布景和服装的富于感染力的灿烂的光彩。这种由我们友好的国家加以认真地和现代化地革新了的和提倡了的古老民间艺术，以越剧为代表，顿时就已支配了听众们的心灵。”
    就是西柏林的“世界报”也对中国越剧团的演出加以好评。它说：“从审美学来看，越剧是具有艺术魔力的”。“世界报”强调越剧全部演出的成功。该报在论述越剧的音乐效果和现代化的舞台设备时写道：“越剧的伴奏音乐是完全能使人领会的。它的旋律是简洁的，而且富于感染力。它的音乐是一种无半音的五音阶音乐，但在节奏上是富于吸引力的。观众随即就会默默地跟着唱。”
