To the Editor:

The number of personal accidents at the Kunming Geological Exploration Company, under the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Geological Bureau, is shockingly high. From January to May of this year, according to very incomplete statistics, there were more than 400 personal accidents, including eight major injury and death accidents. Among these accidents, 467 employees suffered minor injuries, 17 suffered serious injuries, and 12 died. In June, there were three more major injury and death accidents in succession, resulting in a total of six deaths.

Why does this company continue to have such serious accidents? This is inseparable from the lack of attention paid to safety technology work by the responsible personnel of the company. The company has never established a safety technology section in accordance with the instructions of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and no one has been responsible for safety work for a long time. Most accidents are avoidable, but they occur because there is no prior prevention. For example, the treading board of the No. 904 blind shaft was too short, and worker Zhang Zhaojian suggested increasing the length of the treading board, but the leaders did not accept this opinion, resulting in the accident in which worker Wu Shangren fell to his death. After the accident occurred, the leaders often appeared flustered and unable to handle major accidents seriously and in a timely manner, and failed to mobilize the masses to implement various safety systems based on checking the causes of the accidents. As a result, as soon as this accident was dealt with, another accident occurred, and the problem became more and more serious.

We demand that the leading staff of the Kunming Geological Exploration Company quickly correct their erroneous attitude of not paying attention to safety technology work, and actively take effective measures to prevent the continued occurrence of accidents.

### 昆明地质勘探公司必须大力防止人身事故

    昆明地质勘探公司必须大力防止人身事故编辑同志：
    重工业部地质局所属昆明地质勘探公司人身事故多得令人吃惊：从今年一月到五月，据极不完全的统计，就发生了人身事故四百多次，其中重大的伤亡事故有八次。在这些事故中，职工受轻伤的四百六十七人，受重伤的十七人，死亡的十二人。六月份，又连续发生了三次重大的伤亡事故，死亡的共六人。
    为什么这个公司不断发生这样严重的事故呢？这和这个公司的负责人员对待安全技术工作重视不够是分不开的。这个公司始终没有按照重工业部地质局的指示成立安全技术科，安全工作长期无人负责。大部分事故都是可以避免的，但是因为事先没有预防而发生了。例如九○四天井踏板太短，工人张兆俭建议增长踏板，但领导人员不接受这个意见，结果发生了摔死工人武尚人的事故。而在事故发生以后，领导人员往往表现得张惶失措，对重大事故不能及时进行严肃的处理，没有发动群众在检查事故发生原因的基础上贯彻各项保安制度。因此，这个事故刚处理了，那个事故又发生了，问题越来越严重。
    我们要求昆明地质勘探公司的领导工作人员迅速纠正不重视安全技术工作的错误态度，并且积极采取有效措施来防止事故的继续发生。
