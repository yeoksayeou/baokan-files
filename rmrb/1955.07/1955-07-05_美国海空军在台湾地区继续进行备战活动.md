Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—The United States Air Force and Navy are continuing their war preparations in the Taiwan area.

According to an announcement by the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing of the Fifth Air Force flew from its base in Okinawa to Taiwan on July 3rd to replace the 16th Squadron of the 51st Fighter-Bomber Wing. This transfer is part of the U.S.’s so-called air force rotation system based in Taiwan, the purpose of which is to train as many American pilots as possible to familiarize themselves with the conditions in the Taiwan area. Under this system, several U.S. Air Force squadrons have been operating from Taiwan in recent months.

Meanwhile, according to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. Seventh Fleet concluded its war games centered on Penghu on July 3rd, which had begun on July 1st. The news said that although U.S. military officials emphasized the "routine nature" of the exercise, Taipei called it an exercise in "showing strength". In addition to the Task Force 72, which is usually responsible for "patrolling" the Taiwan Strait, more than 20 other warships of the Seventh Fleet participated in the exercise, including the aircraft carrier "Badoeng Strait" and several other units. The news said that the U.S. is doing this to show Asian countries its "strong determination" to invade and occupy China's territory of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—TASS, New York, July 3rd: “The New York World Telegram and Sun” published a dispatch from Taipei by Kennedy, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate, saying that the U.S. military “is studying the issue of stationing U.S. Marines in Taiwan in order to maintain internal security...many senior figures involved in drawing up the plan are considering the possibility of U.S. troops taking on garrison duties here in the future.”

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rear Admiral Burke, the newly appointed Chief of Naval Operations of the U.S. Navy, who is currently active in Southeast Asia, arrived in Taiwan on June 28. According to sources, Burke's trip to the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, South Vietnam, and Taiwan is to "familiarize himself with the situation" and to facilitate the implementation of the U.S.'s aggressive policy in the Pacific region after he returns to the U.S. to take office.

Prior to Burke's arrival in Taiwan, U.S. naval activities in the Taiwan area had already appeared to be increasing. U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride arrived in Taiwan on June 26 to provide Burke with first-hand information on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. On June 27, the U.S.-Chiang military authorities also held a meeting to discuss the situation. There are also reports that the U.S. Seventh Fleet's task force, which "visited" Keelung on June 24, is now patrolling between Okinawa and Taiwan. This task force has been engaged in a series of exercises related to the so-called "defense" of Taiwan.

At the same time, the U.S. is also planning to accelerate the supply of military materials to Taiwan. To this end, Howe, Deputy Commander of the Sacramento Air Materiel Area responsible for supplying the Pacific region, and Wilderom, Commander of the U.S. 315th Air Transport Division stationed in Guam, have been active in Taiwan for several days. The U.S. and Chiang sides are also negotiating the U.S. military assistance utilization plan for Taiwan for the 1956 fiscal year. It is said that this utilization plan will be implemented from September this year, because by that time the shipment of U.S. military assistance materials will enter a "new stage."

After being active in Taiwan for three days, Burke arrived in Japan via Okinawa on June 30 and began inspecting U.S. military facilities in Japan. According to Agence France-Presse, Burke promised to increase U.S. military assistance to the Chiang gang in the naval field, including warships, during his meeting with the Chiang Kai-shek traitor in Taiwan. There are also reports that Burke's investigation in Taiwan is not limited to naval affairs, but also extends to U.S. military administration and foreign "aid" affairs. Burke's current trip to Asia is actually a preparatory step to strengthen the U.S. Navy's aggressive activities in Asia.

　　美国海空军在台湾地区继续进行备战活动
    新华社四日讯　美国海空军在台湾地区的备战活动继续在进行。
    据美国远东空军司令部宣布，第五航空队的第十八战斗—轰炸机联队的第六十七战斗—轰炸机中队已在七月三日从冲绳岛基地飞到台湾，替换第五十一战斗—轰炸机联队的第十六中队。这次转移是美国以台湾为基地的所谓空军轮换制度的一部分，其目的在于训练尽可能多的美国飞行员熟悉台湾地区的情况。根据这个制度，最近几个月以来已经有好几个美国空军中队以台湾为基地进行了活动。
    同时，据法新社报道，美国第七舰队在七月三日结束了从七月一日开始的以澎湖为中心的战争演习。消息说，尽管美国军方人士强调这次演习的
  “常规的性质”，但是台北方面却把它称作为“显示力量”的演习。参加演习的除了平常负责“巡逻”台湾海峡的第七十二特遣舰队以外，还有第七舰队的其他二十多艘军舰，包括航空母舰“巴登海峡号”和几个其他部队。消息说，美国这样做是为了要向亚洲各国表示它侵占中国领土台湾的“坚强的决心”。
    新华社四日讯　塔斯社纽约三日讯：“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”刊载了报纸托辣斯“报业社”的记者肯尼迪从台北发出的消息说，美国军方“正在研究美国海军陆战队驻扎台湾以便维护内部安全的问题……制定计划的许多高级人物都在考虑美国军队将来在这里担任卫戍任务”。
    据新华社讯　正在东南亚各地活动的新近被任命将出任美国海军作战部长的美国海军少将伯克，已在六月二十八日到达台湾。有消息说，伯克的菲律宾、泰国、柬埔寨、南越和台湾之行是为了“熟悉情况”，在便利他在返美就职后执行美国在太平洋区域的侵略政策。
    在伯克到达台湾以前，美国海军方面在台湾地区的活动已经显得增加。美国第七舰队司令普赖德在六月二十六日就先期到达台湾，以便给予伯克以关于台湾海峡局势的第一手情报。六月二十七日，美蒋军事当局还开会讨论了局势。还有消息说，六月二十四日曾经“访问”基隆的美国第七舰队的特遣舰队现在正在冲绳岛和台湾之间巡逻。这支特遣舰队一直在从事有关台湾的所谓“防务”的一系列的演习。
    同时，美国也在策划加速美国对台湾的军事物资的供应。为了这个目的，美国负责供应太平洋地区的萨克拉门托空中物资地区副司令霍威和驻在关岛的美国第三一五空运师司令威尔德朗曾经在台湾活动了好几天。美蒋双方并且正在谈判一九五六财政年度美国对台湾军事援助使用计划。据说这个使用计划将从今年九月开始执行，因为到那个时候美国军事援助物资的装运情况将进入“新的阶段”。
    伯克在台湾活动三天以后，已在六月三十日经过冲绳岛到达日本，并且开始视察在日本的美国军事设施。据法新社透露，伯克在台湾同蒋介石卖国贼会谈时，曾经答应增加美国对蒋贼在海军方面的军事援助，包括军舰在内。还有消息说，伯克在台湾的调查不限于海军事务，而且扩充到美国的军事行政和对外“援助”的事务。伯克当前的亚洲旅行实际上是加强美国海军对亚洲的侵略活动的准备步骤。
