    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the West German Federal Constitutional Court on the 15th, protesting the sentencing of Jupp Angenfort, Chairman of the Free German Youth League of West Germany, to five years of hard labor and Wolfgang Seifert, another leader of the Free German Youth League, to four years in prison. The telegram said that all Chinese youth felt boundless anger at this and lodged a stern protest. The telegram said: These two German youth peace fighters are being falsely accused and persecuted for striving for peace and the friendship of German youth, which is against the will of the peace-loving people and youth of Germany and the world. The Chinese youth demand the revocation of this illegal verdict and the immediate release of Angenfort and Seifert, and the restoration of their inviolable freedom.
    On the same day, the All-China Youth Federation also sent a telegram to Angenfort and Seifert saying: We express our highest respect for your will to persist in the struggle for peace and justice, and express our deepest sympathy for the illegal persecution you have suffered.

    我青联抗议西德法院迫害进步青年领袖
    新华社十六日讯　中华全国民主青年联合会十五日打电报给西德联邦宪法法院，抗议判处西德自由德国青年联盟主席尤普·安根福特五年苦役和自由德国青年联盟的另一领导人沃尔夫冈·塞弗特四年监禁。电文说，全中国青年对此感到无比的愤怒，并且提出严正的抗议。电文说：这两位德国青年和平战士由于争取和平和德国青年的友谊而被诬告和受到迫害，这是违背德国和全世界爱好和平的人民和青年的意志的。中国青年要求撤销这一非法的判决，并且立即释放安根福特和塞弗特，恢复他们不容侵犯的自由。
    同日，中华全国民主青年联合会也打电报给安根福特和塞弗特说：我们对你们为和平和正义而坚持斗争的意志表示崇高的敬意，对你们所遭到的非法迫害表示深切的慰问。
