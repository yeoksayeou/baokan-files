Xinhua News Agency dispatch

    British Foreign Secretary Macmillan
    British Foreign Secretary Macmillan said in the British House of Commons on the 27th that the situation in the Far East remains a matter of serious concern, and he was pleased that China and the United States will have direct contact in Geneva.
    Spokesman for the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs
    Draksovic, a spokesman for the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, welcomed the news of the upcoming talks between China and the United States at a press conference on the 28th. He said that the upcoming Sino-American talks in Geneva will be a positive factor and the most effective way to reach an agreement on the Far East issue.
    Draksovic also talked about the Goa issue. He said that Goa is Indian territory, so it is just and reasonable for the Indian government to demand its incorporation.
    Western European countries
    United Press reporter Randre sent a dispatch from Paris on the 27th saying: "The Sino-American talks to be held in Geneva next Monday have ignited hope throughout the (European) continent that the 'Cold War truce' of the four major powers can be expanded so that Asia can also achieve peace."
    The dispatch said that France "welcomes the decision of the United States and Beijing to hold talks."
    "The highest-level Italian figures are concerned about the upcoming negotiations on the Far East issue in Geneva. The Italian government hopes that the negotiations will make progress in clarifying the issue of trade with Communist China and general peace in Asia." A spokesman for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Geneva negotiations should help to start work on collective security, disarmament, and East-West relations, as these three issues must be dealt with on a global basis, including the West and Asia.
    "People close to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they hope that the ambassadorial-level talks next week may lead to a formal meeting between the foreign ministers of the United States and Communist China. Like Italy, Norway also hopes to ease trade embargoes."
    U.S. Senators
    According to a United Press report from Washington, many Republican and Democratic senators expressed support for the U.S. government's ambassadorial-level talks with the government of the People's Republic of China in Geneva. Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that the U.S. government had made a good start in deciding to hold ambassadorial-level negotiations between the United States and China in Geneva.
    Senator Sparkman, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic senator, said that the United States must recognize that "the Chinese Communists" are "indeed existent," "they have controlled many territories, and they are greatly related to our own position, so why don't we negotiate with them?" Sparkman said: "As long as there is hope of getting some results, we should be willing to negotiate with anyone, anytime, anywhere."
    Republican Senator Aiken said: "You can't deal with people unless you talk to them."
    Democratic Senator Fulbright said that such talks are "very likely" to make some progress.
    Democratic Senator Mansfield also believes that Sino-American talks should be held. At the same time, he said: "We must act carefully" and "wait and see what happens in the preliminary negotiations" before embarking on plans to hold higher-level talks with the Chinese.
    United Press said that the only public attack on holding talks on a Sino-American agreement came from Republican Senator McCarthy.

    各国政府和议会人士欢迎中美会谈
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦二十七日在英国下院发言时说，远东的局势仍然是一个令人严重忧虑的问题，他对中美两国将在日内瓦直接进行接触一事感到满意。
    南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人
    南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人德拉斯科维奇二十八日在记者招待会上对中国和美国即将举行会谈的消息表示欢迎。他说，即将在日内瓦举行的中美会谈将是一个积极的因素，是在远东问题上达成协议的最有效的途径。
    德拉斯科维奇还谈到果阿问题。他说，果阿是印度的领土，因此，印度政府要求归并果阿是正义的，是理所当然的。
    西欧国家
    合众社记者兰德雷二十七日自巴黎发出的一条电讯说：“下星期一在日内瓦举行的中美会谈使整个（欧洲）大陆燃起了希望，希望四大国‘冷战停战’能够加以扩大，而使亚洲也得到和平。”
    这条电讯说，法国“欢迎美国和北京展开会谈的决定”。
    “意大利最高级人士对即将在日内瓦举行的远东问题谈判表示关心。意大利政府希望这次谈判在澄清同共产党中国贸易问题和亚洲普遍和平方面将有进展。”意大利外交部一位发言人认为，日内瓦谈判应该帮助展开在集体安全、裁减军备、东西方关系各项问题上的工作，因为这三个问题必须在全球基础上加以处理，包括西方也包括亚洲。
    “接近挪威外交部的人士说，他们希望下星期的大使级谈判可能会导致美国和共产党中国两国外交部长的正式会议。同意大利一样，挪威也希望放宽贸易禁运。”
    美国参议员
    据合众社华盛顿报道，美国共和党和民主党中许多参议员表示支持美国政府同中华人民共和国政府在日内瓦举行大使级会谈，参议院外交委员会的好几位委员说：美国政府在决定美国和中国在日内瓦举行大使级谈判时，是作了一个良好的开端。
    外交委员会委员、民主党参议员斯巴克曼说，美国必须认识到，“中国共产党”是“的确存在的”，“他们已控制了许多领土，并且和我们自己的地位有很大的关系，因此，我们为什么不同他们谈判呢？”斯巴克曼说：“只要是有得到某种结果的希望，我们都应该愿意随时随地和任何人谈判。”
    共和党参议员埃肯说：“你不和人们谈判，就不能和他们打交道。”
    民主党参议员福尔布莱特说，这种会谈“很有可能”获得某种进展。
    民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德也认为中美会谈是应该举行的。同时，他说：“我们必须小心行事”，以及“等着看看在初步谈判上发生什么事情”，然后再着手执行和中国人举行更高级会谈的计划。
    合众社说，唯一的对于中美协议举行会谈进行公开攻击的是共和党参议员麦卡锡。
