　　Resolutely Crack Down on the Destructive Activities of Reactionary Secret Societies in Rural Areas
　　An Ming
    Since the People's Government issued a decree in 1951 banning reactionary secret societies, many leaders of these societies have registered with the People's Government to express their repentance, ceased their counter-revolutionary activities, and turned to engage in labor production, starting a new life. However, there are also some reactionary secret society leaders who remain unrepentant and determined to be enemies of the people. Some of them, although registered, have never stopped their criminal activities. There are even some leaders who were sentenced to imprisonment or placed under surveillance by the People's Government, who, after serving their sentences or being released from surveillance, colluded with some unapprehended reactionary leaders and other counter-revolutionary elements to actively recruit followers and develop various reactionary secret society organizations, carrying out vicious sabotage against the central tasks of our rural areas at various periods.

    Since 1954, some counties in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi have discovered the destructive activities of reactionary secret societies. In the Bijie Special District of Guizhou Province, the destructive activities of reactionary secret societies such as Yiguan Dao, Guigen Dao, and Tiandao have spread across fifteen districts and thirty-five townships in six counties, including Qianxi, Dading, Weining, Shuicheng, and Hezhang. In the first quarter of this year, Hebei Province discovered the destructive activities of reactionary secret societies such as Yiguan Dao, Dafo Dao, Shengxian Dao, and Xiantian Dao, involving one hundred and forty villages in thirty counties and cities. Most of the leaders carrying out these destructive activities are Chiang Kai-shek's bandit officers, secret agents, and landlord class elements and reactionary rich peasant elements who are resolutely hostile to the people. The Yiguan Dao "Jin Xian Pai Yu Gui" case cracked in Hebei Province was organized with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit officers and secret agents as the core, and reactionary party and league members and professional reactionary leaders as the backbone. The principal offender, Xin Peide, was a Chiang Kai-shek colonel and a "Military Statistics Bureau" agent. They clearly knew their crimes and their counter-revolutionary nature, which had long been exposed to the broad masses of the people. Therefore, when developing followers, they mostly used methods such as visiting relatives, friends, doing business, and seeing doctors, in the name of so-called "kinship" and "friendship" to make contact. After joining the Dao, they would carry out "sealing the mouth oath" education, stipulating that followers must strictly keep "secrets" and are not allowed to confess to the People's Government. Their activities have also become extremely concealed. Some leaders cover up their criminal activities by opening shops; some prepare clothing for peasants, merchants, and students in order to disguise themselves at any time. Some dig underground tunnels, build darkrooms, and build mezzanine walls to set up secret liaison points, secretly directing counter-revolutionary activities. In Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces alone, more than one hundred and fifty underground tunnels and mezzanine walls of reactionary leaders have been uncovered. Some of the underground tunnels can accommodate more than thirty people. In a village in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, underground tunnels connected each other within a radius of two *li*. The underground tunnels were equipped with "offices", as well as gas lamps and mimeographs. Liu Zhihe, the leader of the "Zhong Dao" case cracked in Shandong Province in March this year, had three underground tunnels, which were finally cracked after three searches by us.

    Like other counter-revolutionary elements, reactionary secret societies are hostile to the people and to the cause of socialist construction.

      After the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, they spread various rumors, distorted the government's policies, disturbed people's minds, and provoked the relationship between peasants and the government. In many places, reactionary secret societies also convened meetings of followers, forbidding them to sell surplus grain to the state; and instructed followers to snap up and hoard grain. In March and December of last year, Shaanxi Province successively cracked two cases of reactionary secret societies. The reactionary leader Wu Anxi and others instructed followers such as Liu Wenhua to snap up and purchase grain and oil totaling more than 43,000 *jin* from the state grain company and the grain market for hoarding. When another Yiguan Dao organization "Zhong Dao" case was cracked, a large amount of hoarded grain and flour was dug out from underground tunnels and darkrooms. From the home of a leader in Dali County alone, about forty *shi* of hoarded grain was found. Lin Dongfu, the leader of the Baiyang Dao altar in Weining County, Guizhou Province, even stole more than 7,000 *jin* of hoarded grain to the outside in the middle of the night, and used the unfinished amount to brew wine and cook sugar. Reactionary secret societies in Cangxian Special District of Hebei Province and other places also used deceptive propaganda such as "accumulating good grain" and "accumulating meritorious grain" to obstruct followers and peasants from selling surplus grain to the state. When the government explicitly implemented the planned purchase and planned supply of edible oil, they created the reactionary slogan "Don't buy cattle when cattle are cheap, don't sell oil when oil is expensive," attempting to incite peasants to bury oil. Reactionary secret societies in Guanghan County, Sichuan Province, and other places instructed followers to plant more broad beans, potatoes and other crops, reduce the planting area of grain, and resist the state's measures to increase grain production.

    The rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is one of the main targets of destruction by reactionary secret societies. The means of destruction are also diverse. Some leaders threaten followers, not allowing them to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations; some leaders pretend to be active and infiltrate mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives to carry out sabotage; some organize fake mutual aid teams to cover up their criminal activities. In Panxihe Township, Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, there are two mutual aid teams organized by Yiguan Dao. They often hold Yiguan Dao "class meetings" in the name of holding mutual aid team meetings. Wu Chengde, the reactionary leader of Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, and Li Shifu, the reactionary leader of Jianyang County, not only infiltrated the mutual aid teams, but also seized leadership, resulting in the mutual aid teams becoming tools for them to develop followers and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Yuan Huaiying, the reactionary leader of Yangqu County, Shanxi Province, carried out a series of destructive activities after infiltrating the Shangzhuang Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. In order to increase reactionary forces in the cooperative, he pulled a rich peasant into the cooperative. When the work points were evaluated in the cooperative, he provoked the leaders of two production teams to quarrel. In order to accumulate fertilizer and increase production, the cooperative bought back eighty sheep, and he threatened the members responsible for herding the sheep, saying: "You let them graze, if one of the public's sheep dies, you have to compensate seven." As a result, the shepherd was not in the mood to herd the sheep, and seven sheep died. Just when the cooperative was busy with spring plowing and sowing, he incited seven members to strike for a day. Because of his various provocations and sabotage, four members sold their livestock, and twenty-three households demanded to withdraw from the cooperative.

    Reactionary secret societies also exploit the weaknesses of some peasants' superstition, backwardness, and lack of scientific knowledge, despicably extorting money from peasants, and even murdering peasants' lives. The incident of seeking "fairy water" that occurred in Haikang County, Guangdong Province in August last year affected several nearby counties. After the Spring Festival this year, it spread to eight counties and cities including Zhanjiang and Suixi. The number of people going to seek "fairy water" every day was at least two or three hundred, and at most two or three thousand. Peasants died from drinking "fairy water." In Haikang and other three counties alone, there were thirty-three deaths. The rumor of "fairy water" was created by reactionary secret societies. In February this year, reactionary secret societies in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, created an incident of seeking "divine medicine." Many peasants were deceived by them, abandoned production, took incense paper, brought steamed buns, and some even hitched up carts to burn incense and seek "divine medicine," seriously affecting production. Reactionary secret societies often use names such as "merit fees" and "fulfilling vows" to swindle a large amount of peasants' property. In the Yiguan Dao case cracked in Sanyuan and Fuping counties, Shaanxi Province, the leader Wu Changyan alone defrauded the people of 24,795 yuan, more than three *liang* of gold, one hundred and twenty-five *liang* of silver, six thousand and forty silver dollars, and more than eighty *shi* of grain, as well as cloth and cotton, over the years. A peasant in Kouzhen, Jingyang County, sold twenty *mu* of land and a mule, and handed over all the proceeds as "Dao fees," leaving the whole family with little to eat and wear, and his son also died of illness.

    Even more egregious is that these reactionary secret society leaders take advantage of various names to rape women and abuse young children. Wu Changyan and other reactionary leaders in Shaanxi have coerced many children in their teens into dark underground tunnels to learn "spirit writing." After the children were locked in the underground tunnels, they were not fed enough, did not have enough clothes, and were not given medical treatment when they fell ill. They were also burned with incense and made to kneel on bricks. Some were tortured into disabilities, and some were raped or killed alive. Liu Laiwa and four other children were locked up by them for more than four years. Each of them was pale and bruised all over, and their legs were too weak to walk. Bi Tianbao and five other children have already died tragically in the underground tunnels.

    The various counter-revolutionary activities carried out by reactionary secret societies seriously endanger the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of the people, disrupt social order, and undermine the progress of various tasks and production. We can no longer allow reactionary secret societies to continue to be rampant! All localities must take effective measures to resolutely crack down on the criminal activities of all reactionary secret societies. Those reactionary secret society leaders who continue to carry out destructive activities after being banned, regardless of whether they are large leaders, middle or small leaders, whether they registered in the past or not, whether they are old leaders or newly promoted leaders from among the followers, should be punished accordingly. Those reactionary secret society leaders and backbone elements who have committed heinous crimes and are unrepentant must be severely suppressed. Ordinary followers who continue to participate in the activities of reactionary secret societies after the ban should continue to be subjected to the policy of striving for education, but they must be ordered to go through registration procedures with the government and forced to sign a guarantee to withdraw from the Dao. Only in this way can we effectively defend the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

　　坚决打击反动会道门在农村中的破坏活动
　　安明
    一九五一年人民政府明令取缔反动会道门以来，不少道首向人民政府进行了悔过登记，停止了反革命的活动，转而从事劳动生产，重新做人。但是也有一些反动会道门的道首，仍然执迷不悟，决心与人民为敌。他们有的虽然进行了登记，但一直没有停止其罪恶活动，甚至还有一些曾被人民政府判处徒刑或管制的道首，在刑满释放或解除管制以后，又同一些漏网的反动道首及其他反革命分子勾结起来，积极网罗道徒，发展各种反动会道门组织，针对我农村各个时期的中心工作，进行恶毒的破坏。
    一九五四年以来，陕西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西五省都有一些县份发现了反动会道门的破坏活动。贵州省毕节专区一贯道、归根道、天道等反动会道门的破坏活动遍及黔西、大定、威宁、水城、赫章等六县十五个区三十五个乡。河北省今年第一季度发现一贯道、大佛道、圣贤道、先天道等反动会道门的破坏活动，涉及三十个县、市的一百四十个村庄。这些进行破坏活动的道首大部分是蒋贼军官、特务分子和坚决与人民为敌的地主阶级分子和反动富农分子。河北省破获的一贯道“金线派豫柜”案，就是以蒋贼军官、特务为核心，以反动党团分子和职业的反动道首为骨干组织起来的。首犯辛培德是一个蒋贼上校军官、“军统”特务。他们清楚地知道自己的罪恶及其反革命的本质，早就暴露在广大人民群众的面前，因此在发展道徒时，他们多以走亲、访友、行商、看病等所谓“亲亲”“友友”的方式进行联络。入道后就进行“封口愿”的教育，规定道徒必须严守“机密”，不准向人民政府坦白。他们的活动方式也变得极为隐蔽。有的道首以开设店铺来掩护其罪恶活动；有的准备有农民、商人、学生等服装，以便随时化装。有的则挖地洞、造暗室、筑夹墙，设立秘密联络据点，在暗中指挥反革命的活动。仅河北、陕西、甘肃等省已破获的反动道首的地洞、夹墙就有一百五十多处。其中有的地洞能容纳三十多人。陕西省兴平县有个村子，方圆二华里都有地洞互相勾通。地洞内设有“办公室”，还有汽灯、油印机。山东省今年三月破获的“中道”案的大道首刘志合，一人有三个地洞，经我搜查三次，才最后破获。
    反动会道门和其他反革命分子一样，他们敌视人民，敌视社会主义建设事业。
      粮食统购销政策实行以后，他们散布各种谣言，歪曲政府的政策，扰乱人心，挑拨农民同政府的关系。许多地方的反动会道门还一面召集道徒开会，不准把余粮卖给国家；一面指使道徒抢购和囤积粮食。去年三月、十二月，陕西省先后破获两件反动会道门案，反动道首武安喜等就曾指使道徒刘文华等从国家粮食公司和粮食市场上抢购、套购粮食、油料四万三千多斤进行囤积。在破获另一件一贯道组织“中道”案时，从地洞、暗室中挖出大批囤积的粮食、面粉，仅从大荔县一个道首家中就查出囤积的粮食约四十石。贵州省威宁县白阳道坛主林东福，竟把囤积的七千多斤粮食深夜向外盗运，盗运不完的就用来煮酒、熬糖。河北省沧县专区等地的反动会道门还以“积善粮”、“积功德粮”等等进行欺骗宣传，阻挠道徒和农民向国家出卖余粮。当政府明令实行食油计划收购和计划供应时，他们又制造了“牛贱别买牛、油贵别卖油”的反动口号，企图煽动农民埋藏油料。四川省广汉县等地的反动会道门，则指使道徒多种胡豆、洋芋等作物，缩小粮食播种面积，抗拒国家增产粮食的措施。
    农村互助合作运动，是反动会道门破坏的主要目标之一，其破坏的手段，也是多种多样的。有的道首威胁道徒，不许他们参加互助合作组织；有的道首伪装积极混入互助组和农业生产合作社内部进行破坏；有的组织假互助组来掩护他们的罪恶活动。陕西省宝鸡县磻溪河乡就有两个互助组是一贯道组织的，他们经常以开互助组会的名义开一贯道的“班会”。四川省乐至县反动道首吴成德和简阳县反动道首李世富，不仅混入了互助组，而且窃取了领导权，结果使互助组成为他们发展道徒和进行反革命活动的工具。山西省阳曲县反动道首袁怀英，混入上庄村农业生产合作社之后，就进行了一连串的破坏活动。他为了在社内增加反动力量，就拉了一户富农入社。当社内评工记分时，他挑拨两个生产队的小组长闹别扭、吵架。社里为了积肥增产，买回八十只羊，他就威吓负责牧羊的社员说：“你放吧，公家的羊死了一只得赔七只。”以致牧羊的无心放牧，羊死了七只。正当社内忙着春耕播种的时候，他竟然煽动七个社员罢工一天。因为他的各种挑拨破坏，有四个社员把牲口都卖掉了，有二十三户要求退社。
    反动会道门还利用部分农民迷信落后、科学知识缺乏的弱点，卑鄙地勒索农民的钱财，甚至谋害农民的生命。去年八月，广东省海康县发生的求
  “仙水”事件，波及附近几个县。到今年春节以后，更蔓延到湛江、遂溪等八个县市，每天前往求
  “仙水”的少时二、三百人，多时两三千人。农民因吃“仙水”而病死的，仅海康等三县就有三十三人。而“仙水”的谣言就是反动会道门造出来的。河北省高阳县反动会道门今年二月制造出求“神药”的事件。许多农民受他们欺骗，放下生产，拿着香纸，带上馒头，有的还套上大车，去烧香求“神药”，严重地影响了生产。反动会道门经常用“功德费”“了愿”等名义，大量骗取农民财物。陕西省三原、富平等县破获的一贯道案，仅道首武昌炎一人，几年来就骗取人民财物二万四千七百九十五元，黄金三两多，白银一百二十五两，银元六千零四十个，粮食八十多石，还有布匹、棉花等。泾阳县口镇一个农民卖了二十亩地和一头骡，全部缴了“道费”，弄得全家少吃无穿，儿子也病死了。
    更加恶劣的是这些反动会道门头子假借各种名义，强奸妇女，摧残幼儿。陕西反动道首武昌炎等曾把许多十几岁的孩子诱迫进漆黑的地洞里学“扶生”。孩子们被关进地洞之后，吃不饱，穿不暖，病了不给医治，还要挨香火烧，跪砖头，有的被折磨成了残废，有的被奸污或被活活害死。刘来娃等四个孩子，被他们关了四年多，一个个全身惨白、青肿，两腿软得不能走路。毕天保等五个孩子已经惨死在地洞里。
    反动会道门进行的种种反革命活动，严重地危害着广大人民生命财产的安全，扰乱着社会治安，破坏着各种工作和生产的进行。我们再也不能容许反动会道门继续猖狂下去了！各地一定要采取有效措施，坚决打击一切反动会道门的罪恶活动。对于经过取缔后仍继续进行破坏活动的反动会道门头子，不论大道首或中、小道首，不论过去登记与否，不论老的道首或新从道徒中提升的道首，都应当分别予以惩办。对于那些罪大恶极，怙恶不悛的反动会道门头子、骨干分子，必须实行严厉的镇压。对于在取缔后仍然参加反动会道门活动的普通道徒，虽应继续实行争取教育的政策，但必须责令其向政府履行登记手续并强迫其具结退道。只有如此才能很好地保卫社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业顺利进行。
