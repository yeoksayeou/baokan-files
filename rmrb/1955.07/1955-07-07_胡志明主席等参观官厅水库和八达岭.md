　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Others Visit Guanting Reservoir and Badaling

(By Our Staff Reporter) Vietnamese Democratic Republic President Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam Workers' Party General Secretary Truong Chinh, and Vietnamese government delegation members Le Van Hien, Phan Anh, Nguyen Van Huyen, Nghiem Xuan Yem, Ung Van Khiem, Nguyen Duy Trinh, and Pham Ngoc Thach, accompanied by Director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee Yang Shangkun, Vice Minister of Water Resources Li Baohua, and Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Luo Guibo, yesterday (the 6th) visited the Guanting Reservoir and ascended the famous Great Wall.
    The delegation's special cars arrived at Guanting Reservoir at dawn. Bathed in the light of the rising sun, the delegation was presented with the magnificent 290-meter-long and 45-meter-high dam, as well as rows of clean, white new houses scattered on the mountains. These are the residences of the workers that appeared with the construction of the reservoir. Hao Zhizhai, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Water Resources and Director of the Engineering Bureau during the construction of the Guanting Reservoir, pointed to the reservoir model and introduced the construction of this huge reservoir project on the Yongding River to the delegation. Since 1951, thousands of workers had been changing the face of nature with their labor. The result of 8.3 million workdays was the emergence of a huge reservoir with a storage capacity of nearly 2.3 billion cubic meters. The completion of this reservoir not only controls floods and stores water, relieving Beijing and Tianjin from water disasters, but also turns water hazards into water resources, providing irrigation, transportation, and electricity.
    The delegation then visited the water intake tower, the dam, and the hydroelectric power station under construction. Vice Minister of Water Resources Li Baohua told the delegation that the 10,000-horsepower turbine and generator of the hydroelectric power station were all manufactured by new China's factories. After the power station is completed, the electricity will be transmitted to Beijing to supply the capital's industrial and residential electricity needs.
    Wherever Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the delegation appeared, the workers under construction applauded and cheered enthusiastically. When leaving, Chairman Ho Chi Minh smiled kindly and nodded to the many workers who came to see them off, and encouraged them in Chinese: "You do it fast, do it fast, do it economically. The success of the Chinese working people is the success of the Vietnamese people!"
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Comrade Truong Chinh, and the delegation members all signed the reservoir's commemorative album.
    The train carrying the distinguished guests traveled through layers of overlapping mountains to the strategically important Juyongguan and Badaling. This is one of the key passes of the Great Wall. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Comrade Truong Chinh, and the delegation members all enthusiastically braved the scorching sun to climb this famous historical site. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, while nimbly climbing the layers of bunkers at Badaling, said with a smile:
  "There is an ancient Chinese poem that says, 'To see a thousand miles further, ascend another story.' Today I am 'To see a thousand miles further, ascend another section of the Wall'." He and the delegation members all climbed to the heights of Badaling, took in the magnificent scenery of rolling mountains and strategically important passes, praised the great achievements of the Chinese working people, and carefully observed the construction of the Great Wall. On the way back, Chairman Ho wrote a poem in Chinese: "I heard the Great Wall stretches ten thousand miles long, with its head linked to the East Sea and its tail to the Western border. Several thousand million laborers built this town and fortress on one side."
    Xinhua News Agency, dated the 5th, reports that members of the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Le Van Hien, Nghiem Xuan Yem, Ung Van Khiem, and Pham Ngoc Thach, visited the Palace Museum on the afternoon of the 5th. The distinguished guests visited the three major halls of the Palace Museum, the International Friendship Museum, and the Ceramics Museum.

　　胡志明主席等参观官厅水库和八达岭
    本报讯　越南民主共和国主席胡志明、越南劳动党总书记长征和越南政府代表团团员黎文献、潘英、阮文煊、严春庵、雍文谦、阮维祯、范玉石昨（六）日在中共中央办公厅主任杨尚昆、水利部副部长李葆华、中国驻越南大使罗贵波的陪同下，参观了官厅水库，并登临了著名的长城。
    代表团的专车迎着晨曦到达官厅水库。在初升朝日的照耀下，展现在代表团面前的是二百九十公尺长、四十五公尺高的雄伟的拦河坝以及散布在山上的一层层、一排排白色洁净的新屋。这是随着水库的修建而出现的劳动者的住屋。水利部办公厅副主任、修建官厅水库时的工程局局长郝执斋指着水库模型给代表团介绍了矗立在永定河上这一巨大水库工程的修建情况。自一九五一年起这里曾经有成千上万的工人在用自己的劳动改变着自然的面貌。八百三十万个劳动日付出的结果，是出现了蓄水量将近二十三亿立方公尺的巨大水库。这一水库的建成，不仅拦洪蓄水，解除了北京、天津的水灾；并将变水患为水利，既可灌溉、运输，又将供应电力。
    代表团随后参观了进水塔、拦河坝和正在修建的水力发电站。水利部副部长李葆华告诉代表团：水力发电站的一万马力的涡轮机和发电机全部是由新中国工厂自己制造的。发电站完成后，电力将输送到北京，供应首都的工业用电和居民的生活用电。
    在胡志明主席和代表团出现的地方，正在建设的工人都热烈地鼓掌欢呼。在临走的时候，胡志明主席对拥上来送行的许多工人亲切地微笑点头，并用中国话鼓励他们：“你们搞得快，搞得快，搞得节约。中国劳动人民的成功就是我们越南人民的成功！”
    胡志明主席、长征同志和代表团团员都在水库的纪念册上签字留念。
    火车载着贵宾穿越过重重叠叠的山峦，来到地形险要的居庸关和八达岭。这是万里长城的要塞之一。胡志明主席、长征同志和代表团团员都兴致勃勃地冒着烈日，登临这一著名的古迹。胡主席一面矫健地攀登着八达岭的一层层碉堡，一面笑着说：
  “中国有句古诗‘欲穷千里目，更上一层楼’，我今天是‘欲穷千里目，更上一层墙’了。”他和代表团团员都登临了八达岭的高处，纵览群山起伏、关隘险要的胜景，赞扬中国劳动人民的伟大成就，并仔细观察了长城的建筑。在归途中，胡主席并用中文写了一首诗：“听说长城万里长，头联东海尾西疆。几千百万劳动者，建筑兹城镇一方。”
    据新华社五日讯　越南民主共和国政府代表团团员黎文献、严春庵、雍文谦、范玉石，在五日下午参观了故宫博物院。贵宾们参观了故宫的三大殿、国际友谊馆、陶瓷馆。
