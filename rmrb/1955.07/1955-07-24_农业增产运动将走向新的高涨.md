    Agricultural Production Increase Movement Will Usher in a New Upsurge
    Our reporter Zhou Huizhi
    Some of the delegates attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress focused on studying the agricultural part when discussing the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country. They generally believe that the increased production targets stipulated in the plan are well-founded, stable and reliable. In general, there is no problem in completing the plan, and it can be exceeded if it is done well.
    When studying agricultural production increase targets, the delegates combined them with the specific conditions of their regions and made preliminary plans to tap potential and strive for over-production. Sichuan is the province with the largest grain output. It has achieved bumper harvests in the first two years of the five-year plan. From 1952 to 1954, grain production has increased by about 10% in two years. The Sichuan delegates are confident that they will complete and exceed the requirement to increase grain production by 17.6% in five years. Delegate Yan Hongyan said: "Sichuan Province has a large population and little land, and the farming is relatively meticulous. Although the yield of paddy fields cannot be increased a lot at once, Sichuan is characterized by the large variety of crops. Highland areas have highland crops, and hilly areas have hilly crops, and the yields of wheat, corn, etc. are very high. In the future, we should pay attention to diversified management." Delegate Yan Hongyan believes that "as long as the masses can be mobilized to solve the problems of small-scale water conservancy and fertilizers, there are many places in Sichuan where another season can be planted." He said: "Sichuan Province exports about 2 billion catties of grain this year. If the output increases in the future and transportation conditions improve, it can export more grain every year to support other places."
    Hebei Province, one of the main cotton-producing areas, has suffered production declines due to disasters in the past two years and has not completed its plan. This year, Hebei Province planted more than 17.6 million mu of cotton, exceeding the national plan by more than 400,000 mu; it plans to produce 5.87 million dan of cotton, exceeding the national requirement by 170,000 dan. Delegate Lin Tie estimates based on the current situation: "Although there are some insect pests, the actual output may be slightly higher than the original plan." He said confidently: "By 1957, the cotton planting area in Hebei Province can be expanded to more than 18.8 million mu, and the yield per unit area can be increased from 34 jin this year to 39 jin, and the total output will reach more than 7.4 million dan, which is 27% more than in 1952." He specifically analyzed Hebei's natural conditions and potential for increased production, saying: "Hebei Province is prone to natural disasters, with spring droughts and autumn floods every year. In the past few years, the average area affected by floods has been more than 20 million mu every year. Therefore, disaster prevention is the main key to increasing production in the future. We have already started the flood control projects of the Hutuo River and Dou River, and organized the masses to universally carry out the work of digging wells and ditching and ridging fields, which are important measures to overcome disasters and strive for high yields."
    Delegate Lin Tie flipped through the materials and continued: "Hebei Province has 18 million mu of low-lying land and 7 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. We plan to change the planting of early-maturing crops to 10 million mu within three years, reclaim 1 million mu of wasteland, and expand the multiple cropping area, expand the planting of high-yield crops, universally promote new technologies, and improve leadership methods. By 1957, grain production can also exceed the national target of 18.1 billion jin." He said: "When the grain output reaches 22 billion jin, Hebei Province will be completely self-sufficient."
    Delegates from Heilongjiang said that their potential for increased production is the greatest. They believe that as long as the farming techniques of the existing cultivated land are improved, a lot of grain can be increased. Delegate Ren Guodong said: "According to the requirements of the five-year plan, Heilongjiang needs to increase grain production by an average of 87 jin per hectare per year. However, in many places, as long as the ridge width of sorghum is reduced from two chi to one chi eight, and the plant spacing is appropriately shortened, and the smut disease is eliminated, each hectare can increase production by 1,000 jin." According to what the delegates saw during their inspection in Jiamusi, Huachuan and other places, the corn plant spacing is generally around three chi, which can be shortened by at least half. As for the phenomena of broken rows, missing seedlings, less plowing, and lazy fertilization, the phenomenon of extensive cultivation is even more common. The idea of "hanging around and messing around in the wilderness" is still playing a role among the masses. Delegate Ren Guodong believes that to solve this problem, it is necessary to vigorously carry out publicity and education work among the masses and district and township staff. He said: "At present, some masses are not very enthusiastic about new technologies, and some cadres are shrinking back and not very motivated. When I inspected, I visited a responsible staff member in a district, and this staff member had no plan to improve technology at all. This phenomenon must be corrected to ensure increased production."
    Heilongjiang also has countless pieces of fertile wasteland of all sizes, which is our country's untapped grain treasure. Delegates Yang Xianting and Deng Guozhang praised the wasteland when they talked about it, saying: There is so much wasteland, everywhere! It is flat and flat, with a black soil layer two or three chi deep. Plowing it for eight or ten years without applying manure will still produce grain as usual. They said: The people of Heilongjiang are very welcome to farmers from Guanxi to go there to jointly develop the country's granary. More than 10,000 immigrant households who came from Shandong this spring have settled down and are actively producing with the help of local farmers. Agricultural cooperatives with local conditions are also organizing manpower to reclaim wasteland nearby. The "July 1st" agricultural cooperative in Suihua Ninth District, where Delegate Wang Ximing is located, dispatched a remote farming team composed of 30 laborers this spring to open up 25 hectares of wasteland in the Fourth District, 80 li away, and planted rice. The seedlings are growing very well now, and it is estimated that each hectare can produce 6,000 jin.
    Agricultural production cooperation is not only a guarantee of increased production, but also the only way to transform the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, delegates from all over the country have fully studied the development of cooperatives, and generally have the confidence to complete or exceed the national plan. Hebei Province developed nearly 100,000 cooperatives last winter and this spring, with more than 2.9 million peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 38% of the total number of peasant households. The work was a bit rough during the major development, but after more than two months of serious rectification, there are still more than 2.7 million peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 35% of the total number of peasant households. In order to continue to consolidate and steadily develop, they will combine the reorganization of institutions and draw more than 11,000 cadres equivalent to the district level or above and send them to the townships as resident instructors in the counties and districts to strengthen grassroots work and guide the mutual aid and cooperation movement on a full-time basis. They plan to have more than 60% of the total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the winter of 1957. Currently, one-third of the peasant households in Heilongjiang Province have joined the cooperatives, and it is expected to reach about 50% by the end of the five-year plan. Some places with better foundations may reach about 70%. Delegates from Sichuan believe that although there are only more than 28,000 agricultural cooperatives in their province, the foundation of mutual aid teams is not bad. There are currently more than 310,000 perennial mutual aid teams in the province (including 77,000 joint teams), and their members are mostly enthusiastically requesting or have already prepared to build cooperatives after the autumn. The delegates plan to further improve and enhance the mutual aid teams, train and train the backbone for building cooperatives, and strive to develop 160,000 cooperatives before the spring plowing in 1957, with more than 50% of the total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives.
    After discussing the draft of the five-year plan, many peasant delegates specifically saw the beautiful scenery of the country's socialist industrialization, and were prepared to go back and mobilize the vast number of peasants to increase grain and industrial raw materials in accordance with the national plan to support industrial construction. After listening to Comrade Li Fuchun's report, Shandong peasant delegate Lü Hongbin couldn't sleep while lying in bed during his lunch break. He got up and wrote letters to the cadres and peasants in his township and cooperative, asking them to study the report on the five-year plan carefully and revise the production increase plan. He said: "In the past, when we made plans, it was like a gourd without a handle, and there was no way to grasp it. Now that we have a goal, we must use more specific and verifiable plans to organize production so that the masses can work hard for this goal, and the national plan will be guaranteed."
    Although Lushan County in Henan is not a major tobacco-producing area, the soil there is very suitable for growing tobacco. Delegate Su Dianxuan saw that the five-year plan required a large increase in flue-cured tobacco production, and he was prepared to lead the farmers to expand the planting of flue-cured tobacco. The agricultural cooperative he is in has already planted 300 mu of tobacco this year, and plans to plant another 100 mu of late tobacco. He also often pondered a question, that is, some farmers are unwilling to sell flue-cured tobacco on time. He said: "This will disrupt the country's acquisition plan. After returning, we must persuade them to obey the national plan and sell flue-cured tobacco on time." Jianyang area in Sichuan is a hilly area, where sweet potatoes used to grow in large areas. Now, this famous sweet potato area has become a cotton-producing area. Delegate Zhang Sizhou lives in this area, and he is prepared to formulate a three-year plan in accordance with national requirements after returning to continue to increase grain and cotton production. Last year, the agricultural cooperative he is in was also supplied with more than 150 jin of fine grain per person by the state. He plans to not only not need the state to supply grain next year, but also sell some fine grain to the state.
    What Delegate Pu Zhongzhi from Shaanxi thought about was something else. He said that the farmers in Guanzhong Plain have a lot of spare money. In addition to purchasing means of production to expand reproduction, some people are preparing to demolish thatched houses and build tile houses. This spring, he has persuaded seven farmers to live in thatched houses for a few more years and deposit the money in the bank. Now he feels even more the importance of this work, and plans to mobilize more people to deposit their spare money in the bank to support national construction after returning.
    The delegates have their own ideas and plans, but the purpose is the same - to complete the national plan.
    Now, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress is proceeding intensely. The delegates are still discussing seriously. The national farmers and agricultural workers, like people from all walks of life, are also paying attention to every progress of the conference, listening to every message of the conference, and preparing to fully implement the resolutions of the conference. It can be predicted that the agricultural large-scale production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation is about to usher in a new upsurge.

    农业增产运动将走向新的高涨
    本报记者　周慧之
    出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的一部分代表，在分组讨论我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案时，着重地研究了农业的部分。他们对计划中所规定的增产指标，普遍认为是有根有据，稳妥可靠，一般情况下完成计划没问题，搞得好还可以超过。
    代表们在研究农业增产指标时，都结合所在地区的具体情况，作出挖掘潜力、争取超额增产的初步打算。四川是出产粮食最多的省份，在这个五年计划的头两年中都获得了丰收，一九五二年到一九五四年，两年中粮食已经增产了百分之十左右。四川代表们有信心完成并超过五年中增产粮食百分之十七点六的要求。阎红彦代表说：“四川省人多田少，耕作比较细致，水田产量虽然不可能一下子提高很多，但四川的特点是作物种类多，高山区有高山区的作物，丘陵地有丘陵地的作物，而且小麦、玉米等产量都很高，今后应当重视多种经营。”阎红彦代表认为：“只要能发动群众解决小型水利、肥料问题，四川有很多地方还可以多种一季。”他说：“四川省今年外运粮食约二十多亿斤，将来产量增加，交通条件改善，每年还可以运出更多的粮食支援外地。”
    棉花主要产地之一的河北省，过去两年都因灾减产，没有完成计划。今年，河北省共种棉花一千七百六十多万亩，超过国家计划四十多万亩；计划产棉五百八十七万担，超过国家要求十七万担。林铁代表根据当前情况估计：“虽然有些虫害，实产量还可能比原计划稍高些。”他很有信心地说：“到一九五七年，河北省的植棉面积可以扩大到一千八百八十多万亩，单位面积产量可以从今年的三十四斤提高到三十九斤，总产量将达到七百四十多万担，那就比一九五二年增长了百分之二十七。”他具体分析河北的自然条件和增产潜力说：“河北省自然灾害较重，年年都是春旱秋涝。几年来，每年平均受水灾面积都在两千万亩以上。因而防灾是今后增产的主要关键。我们已经着手进行滹沱河、陡河的防洪工程，并组织群众普遍开展打井和沟洫畦田的工作，这都是战胜灾害、争取丰产的重要措施。”
    林铁代表翻了翻材料继续说：“河北省有一千八百万亩低洼地，七百万亩可垦荒地，我们计划三年内改种早熟作物等一千万亩，开荒一百万亩，再加上扩大复种面积，扩种高产作物，普遍推广新技术，改善领导方法等，到一九五七年，粮食生产也可以超过国家规定的一百八十一亿斤的任务。”他说：“等到粮食产量达到二百二十亿斤时，河北省就完全可以自给了。”
    来自黑龙江的代表说他们那里的增产潜力最大。他们认为只要把现有耕地的耕作技术改进一下，就能增产很多粮食。任国栋代表说：“根据五年计划的要求，黑龙江平均每年每垧地要增产八十七斤粮食。但很多地方只要把高粱的垅幅从二尺缩到一尺八，再适当缩短株距，消灭黑穗病，每垧地就可以增产一千斤。”根据代表们在佳木斯、桦川等地视察时所看到的，玉米株距一般都在三尺左右，至少可以缩短一半。至于断条缺苗、少耕翻、懒施肥等耕作粗放的现象，更是普遍。“吊儿浪当混大荒”的思想还在群众中起着作用。任国栋代表认为要解决这一问题，必须大力向群众和区乡工作人员进行宣传教育工作。他说：“目前有些群众对新技术还不太热情，一部分干部又缩手缩脚，积极性不高，我视察时曾访问一个区里的负责工作人员，这位工作人员根本就没有改进技术的计划。必须纠正这种现象，增产才有保证。”
    黑龙江还有大小无数片的肥美荒地，是我国尚未开辟的粮食宝藏。杨显亭和邓国章两代表谈起荒地时，赞不绝口地说：荒地真多啊，到处都是！平平坦坦，黑土层二、三尺深，耕起来十年八年不上粪也照常产粮食。他们说：黑龙江人非常欢迎关内农民到那里去，共同开发祖国的粮仓。今春从山东去的一万多户移民，在当地农民帮助下，都已安居乐业，积极生产。当地有条件的农业社，也正组织人力就近开荒。王喜明代表所在的绥化九区“七一”农业社，今年春季抽出三十个劳动力组成一个远耕队，到八十里外的四区开了二十五垧荒地，种上水稻，现在秧苗长得很好，估计每垧可产六千斤。
    农业生产合作化既是增产的保证，又是改造小农经济的必由之路，因而各地代表对发展合作社都作了充分研究，一般也都有信心完成或超过国家计划。河北省去冬今春发展了近十万个社，入社农户二百九十多万户，占总农户百分之三十八。大发展中工作有些粗糙，但经过两个多月的认真整顿，入社农户还有二百七十多万户，占总农户百分之三十五。为了继续巩固和稳步发展，他们结合整编机构，将抽出相当于区级以上的干部一万一千多人，派到乡里去，作为县区的驻乡指导员，以加强基层工作，专职指导互助合作运动。他们计划在一九五七年冬季，入社农户达到总农户百分之六十以上。黑龙江省目前入社农户已有三分之一，五年计划末可达百分之五十左右，有些基础较好的地方可能达到百分之七十左右。四川代表认为他们省虽然现在只有二万八千多个农业社，但互助组基础还不坏。全省现有常年互助组三十一万多个（其中有联组七万七千个），其成员大都热烈要求或者已经准备在秋后建社。代表们计划进一步健全和提高互助组，培养和训练建社骨干，争取在一九五七年春耕前发展到十六万个社，入社农户达到总农户百分之五十左右。
    很多农民代表在讨论了五年计划草案以后，具体地看到祖国社会主义工业化的美景，都准备回去以后动员广大农民按照国家计划增产粮食和工业原料，支援工业建设。山东农民代表吕鸿宾听了李富春同志的报告以后，午睡时躺在床上睡不着觉，翻起来写信给乡里和社里的干部和农民，要他们好好学习关于五年计划的报告，重订增产计划。他说：“过去订计划，像个没把的葫芦，没法抓。现在有了目标，我们必须用更具体的可以检查的计划来组织生产，让群众都来为这个目标努力，国家计划才有保证。”
    河南鲁山县虽然不是主要产烟区，但那里的土质很适合种烟。苏殿选代表看到五年计划中要求大量增产烤烟，他准备回去带动农民扩种烤烟。他所在的农业社今年已种烟三百亩，还准备再种一百亩晚烟。他还经常盘算着一个问题，就是有些农民不肯按时出卖烤烟。他说：“这样就打乱了国家的收购计划，回去后一定要说服他们服从国家计划，按时出卖烤烟。”四川简阳一带是丘陵地区，过去大片生长红苕。现在，这个有名的红苕区已经变成产棉区。张泗洲代表就住在这个地区，他准备回去以后按照国家要求制定一个三年计划，继续提高粮棉产量。他所在的农业社，去年还由国家供给每人一百五十多斤细粮，他计划明年不仅不要国家供给粮食，还要卖些细粮给国家。
    陕西代表蒲忠智所想的又是另外一回事。他说他们关中平原的农民手里余钱很多，除了购买生产资料扩大再生产以外，有些人准备拆草房盖瓦房，今春，他已经说服了七户农民暂住几年草房，把钱存入了银行。现在他更感觉到这一工作的重要，打算回去以后动员更多的人把余钱存入银行，支援国家建设。
    代表们各人有各人的想法，各人有各人的计划，而目的却是一个——完成国家计划。
    现在，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正在紧张进行，代表们还在认真讨论，全国农民和农业工作者和其他各界人民一样，也都在注视大会的每一进展，倾听大会的每一消息，并准备全力贯彻大会的决议。可以预见，以互助合作为中心的农业大生产运动，即将走向新的高涨。
