    Agricultural Production Increase Movement Will Usher in a New Upsurge
    Our reporter Zhou Huizhi
    Some of the delegates attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress focused on studying the agricultural part when discussing the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country. They generally believe that the increased production targets stipulated in the plan are well-founded, stable and reliable. In general, there is no problem in completing the plan, and it can be exceeded if it is done well.
    When studying agricultural production increase targets, the delegates combined them with the specific conditions of their regions and made preliminary plans to tap potential and strive for over-production. Sichuan is the province with the largest grain output. It has achieved bumper harvests in the first two years of the five-year plan. From 1952 to 1954, grain production has increased by about 10% in two years. The Sichuan delegates are confident that they will complete and exceed the requirement to increase grain production by 17.6% in five years. Delegate Yan Hongyan said: "Sichuan Province has a large population and little land, and the farming is relatively meticulous. Although the yield of paddy fields cannot be increased a lot at once, Sichuan is characterized by the large variety of crops. Highland areas have highland crops, and hilly areas have hilly crops, and the yields of wheat, corn, etc. are very high. In the future, we should pay attention to diversified management." Delegate Yan Hongyan believes that "as long as the masses can be mobilized to solve the problems of small-scale water conservancy and fertilizers, there are many places in Sichuan where another season can be planted." He said: "Sichuan Province exports about 2 billion catties of grain this year. If the output increases in the future and transportation conditions improve, it can export more grain every year to support other places."
    Hebei Province, one of the main cotton-producing areas, has suffered production declines due to disasters in the past two years and has not completed its plan. This year, Hebei Province planted more than 17.6 million mu of cotton, exceeding the national plan by more than 400,000 mu; it plans to produce 5.87 million dan of cotton, exceeding the national requirement by 170,000 dan. Delegate Lin Tie estimates based on the current situation: "Although there are some insect pests, the actual output may be slightly higher than the original plan." He said confidently: "By 1957, the cotton planting area in Hebei Province can be expanded to more than 18.8 million mu, and the yield per unit area can be increased from 34 jin this year to 39 jin, and the total output will reach more than 7.4 million dan, which is 27% more than in 1952." He specifically analyzed Hebei's natural conditions and potential for increased production, saying: "Hebei Province is prone to natural disasters, with spring droughts and autumn floods every year. In the past few years, the average area affected by floods has been more than 20 million mu every year. Therefore, disaster prevention is the main key to increasing production in the future. We have already started the flood control projects of the Hutuo River and Dou River, and organized the masses to universally carry out the work of digging wells and ditching and ridging fields, which are important measures to overcome disasters and strive for high yields."
    Delegate Lin Tie flipped through the materials and continued: "Hebei Province has 18 million mu of low-lying land and 7 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. We plan to change the planting of early-maturing crops to 10 million mu within three years, reclaim 1 million mu of wasteland, and expand the multiple cropping area, expand the planting of high-yield crops, universally promote new technologies, and improve leadership methods. By 1957, grain production can also exceed the national target of 18.1 billion jin." He said: "When the grain output reaches 22 billion jin, Hebei Province will be completely self-sufficient."
    Delegates from Heilongjiang said that their potential for increased production is the greatest. They believe that as long as the farming techniques of the existing cultivated land are improved, a lot of grain can be increased. Delegate Ren Guodong said: "According to the requirements of the five-year plan, Heilongjiang needs to increase grain production by an average of 87 jin per hectare per year. However, in many places, as long as the ridge width of sorghum is reduced from two chi to one chi eight, and the plant spacing is appropriately shortened, and the smut disease is eliminated, each hectare can increase production by 1,000 jin." According to what the delegates saw during their inspection in Jiamusi, Huachuan and other places, the corn plant spacing is generally around three chi, which can be shortened by at least half. As for the phenomena of broken rows, missing seedlings, less plowing, and lazy fertilization, the phenomenon of extensive cultivation is even more common. The idea of "hanging around and messing around in the wilderness" is still playing a role among the masses. Delegate Ren Guodong believes that to solve this problem, it is necessary to vigorously carry out publicity and education work among the masses and district and township staff. He said: "At present, some masses are not very enthusiastic about new technologies, and some cadres are shrinking back and not very motivated. When I inspected, I visited a responsible staff member in a district, and this staff member had no plan to improve technology at all. This phenomenon must be corrected to ensure increased production."
    Heilongjiang also has countless pieces of fertile wasteland of all sizes, which is our country's untapped grain treasure. Delegates Yang Xianting and Deng Guozhang praised the wasteland when they talked about it, saying: There is so much wasteland, everywhere! It is flat and flat, with a black soil layer two or three chi deep. Plowing it for eight or ten years without applying manure will still produce grain as usual. They said: The people of Heilongjiang are very welcome to farmers from Guanxi to go there to jointly develop the country's granary. More than 10,000 immigrant households who came from Shandong this spring have settled down and are actively producing with the help of local farmers. Agricultural cooperatives with local conditions are also organizing manpower to reclaim wasteland nearby. The "July 1st" agricultural cooperative in Suihua Ninth District, where Delegate Wang Ximing is located, dispatched a remote farming team composed of 30 laborers this spring to open up 25 hectares of wasteland in the Fourth District, 80 li away, and planted rice. The seedlings are growing very well now, and it is estimated that each hectare can produce 6,000 jin.
    Agricultural production cooperation is not only a guarantee of increased production, but also the only way to transform the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, delegates from all over the country have fully studied the development of cooperatives, and generally have the confidence to complete or exceed the national plan. Hebei Province developed nearly 100,000 cooperatives last winter and this spring, with more than 2.9 million peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 38% of the total number of peasant households. The work was a bit rough during the major development, but after more than two months of serious rectification, there are still more than 2.7 million peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 35% of the total number of peasant households. In order to continue to consolidate and steadily develop, they will combine the reorganization of institutions and draw more than 11,000 cadres equivalent to the district level or above and send them to the townships as resident instructors in the counties and districts to strengthen grassroots work and guide the mutual aid and cooperation movement on a full-time basis. They plan to have more than 60% of the total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the winter of 1957. Currently, one-third of the peasant households in Heilongjiang Province have joined the cooperatives, and it is expected to reach about 50% by the end of the five-year plan. Some places with better foundations may reach about 70%. Delegates from Sichuan believe that although there are only more than 28,000 agricultural cooperatives in their province, the foundation of mutual aid teams is not bad. There are currently more than 310,000 perennial mutual aid teams in the province (including 77,000 joint teams), and their members are mostly enthusiastically requesting or have already prepared to build cooperatives after the autumn. The delegates plan to further improve and enhance the mutual aid teams, train and train the backbone for building cooperatives, and strive to develop 160,000 cooperatives before the spring plowing in 1957, with more than 50% of the total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives.
    After discussing the draft of the five-year plan, many peasant delegates specifically saw the beautiful scenery of the country's socialist industrialization, and were prepared to go back and mobilize the vast number of peasants to increase grain and industrial raw materials in accordance with the national plan to support industrial construction. After listening to Comrade Li Fuchun's report, Shandong peasant delegate LÃ¼ Hongbin couldn't sleep while lying in bed during his lunch break. He got up and wrote letters to the cadres and peasants in his township and cooperative, asking them to study the report on the five-year plan carefully and revise the production increase plan. He said: "In the past, when we made plans, it was like a gourd without a handle, and there was no way to grasp it. Now that we have a goal, we must use more specific and verifiable plans to organize production so that the masses can work hard for this goal, and the national plan will be guaranteed."
    Although Lushan County in Henan is not a major tobacco-producing area, the soil there is very suitable for growing tobacco. Delegate Su Dianxuan saw that the five-year plan required a large increase in flue-cured tobacco production, and he was prepared to lead the farmers to expand the planting of flue-cured tobacco. The agricultural cooperative he is in has already planted 300 mu of tobacco this year, and plans to plant another 100 mu of late tobacco. He also often pondered a question, that is, some farmers are unwilling to sell flue-cured tobacco on time. He said: "This will disrupt the country's acquisition plan. After returning, we must persuade them to obey the national plan and sell flue-cured tobacco on time." Jianyang area in Sichuan is a hilly area, where sweet potatoes used to grow in large areas. Now, this famous sweet potato area has become a cotton-producing area. Delegate Zhang Sizhou lives in this area, and he is prepared to formulate a three-year plan in accordance with national requirements after returning to continue to increase grain and cotton production. Last year, the agricultural cooperative he is in was also supplied with more than 150 jin of fine grain per person by the state. He plans to not only not need the state to supply grain next year, but also sell some fine grain to the state.
    What Delegate Pu Zhongzhi from Shaanxi thought about was something else. He said that the farmers in Guanzhong Plain have a lot of spare money. In addition to purchasing means of production to expand reproduction, some people are preparing to demolish thatched houses and build tile houses. This spring, he has persuaded seven farmers to live in thatched houses for a few more years and deposit the money in the bank. Now he feels even more the importance of this work, and plans to mobilize more people to deposit their spare money in the bank to support national construction after returning.
    The delegates have their own ideas and plans, but the purpose is the same - to complete the national plan.
    Now, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress is proceeding intensely. The delegates are still discussing seriously. The national farmers and agricultural workers, like people from all walks of life, are also paying attention to every progress of the conference, listening to every message of the conference, and preparing to fully implement the resolutions of the conference. It can be predicted that the agricultural large-scale production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation is about to usher in a new upsurge.
