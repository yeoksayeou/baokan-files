Oppose "Killing the Chicken to Get the Eggs" Style of Production Method
To the Editor:

    The leading staff of the Datong Mining Bureau's Second Mine do not pay attention to the maintenance of coal mining machinery, resulting in very serious machinery damage.

    The mine's hoisting winch, transportation winch, electrical and other fixed equipment originally had a regular shutdown maintenance system. However, the mine director said to the electromechanical department staff responsible for maintenance: "The machines are working fine, what's the point of inspecting them? Wait until they break down." As a result, these machines have not been maintained for years, and accidents have occurred repeatedly. The steel wire rope inspection system, which is related to the safety of workers' lives, has also been cancelled. In the event of an accident, irreparable losses will be caused! The machinery on the work surface is supposed to be two production shifts and one maintenance shift per day, but the leadership decided to change it to three production shifts, squeezing out the maintenance work, which greatly shortened the life of the machinery. Many machines have shown signs of damage, but the administrative leadership still insists on using them at risk. For example, the head of the No. 5 well's 816 working face's sixth scraper conveyor was unstable, and the electromechanical department repeatedly requested repairs, but the administrative leadership did not give time. As a result, the small chain broke eleven times in one shift's production time, affecting production.

    The system of dedicated personnel for dedicated machines in this mine has not been implemented for a long time. The drivers of electric scraper conveyors, reversing winches, small fans, etc., are not only not fixed, but are often filled by "injured" and "sick" personnel. Due to the drivers' unfamiliarity with the operation, their inability to identify problems also increased machine accidents.

    The reason why the leading staff of this mine do not pay attention to machinery maintenance is because they simply pursue the completion of the output plan, believing that machinery maintenance work will take up production time. However, the consequence of their wrong approach is massive machinery damage and increased accidents. This not only wastes national wealth, but also affects production; more seriously, it also makes workers worry about using mechanical and electrical equipment, hindering the rapid improvement of the degree of coal mining mechanization. I believe that the production method adopted by the leaders of this mine is a "killing the chicken to get the eggs" method, which must be corrected.

### 反对“杀鸡取蛋”式的生产方法

    反对“杀鸡取蛋”式的生产方法编辑同志：
    大同矿务局第二矿的领导工作人员不重视采煤机械的维修工作，以致机械损坏情况十分严重。
    这个矿的提升绞车、运输绞车、电气等固定设备原有定期停机检修制度。但是，矿长对负责检修的机电科工作人员说：“好好的机器，检查它干什么？等坏了再说。”因此这些机器年久失修，屡次发生事故。工人生命安全所系的钢丝绳检验制度也被取消了，万一发生事故，就会造成不能弥补的损失！工作面的机械，按规定是每天两班生产，一班检修；可是领导方面决定改成三班都是生产，把检修工作挤掉了，以致机器寿命大为缩短。很多机械已经出现了损坏的迹象，但是行政领导方面还硬是要冒险使用。如五号井八一六工作面第六部溜子的机头不稳，机电科屡次提出要检修，但行政领导方面不给时间，结果在一个班的生产时间内就断小链十一次，影响了生产。
    这个矿的专人专机制度长久以来也没有被执行。电溜子、回柱绞车、小风扇等的司机不但不固定，还经常由“公伤”“病号”来充任。由于司机操作不熟练，不能发现问题也增加了机器事故。
    这个矿的领导工作人员所以不重视机械维修工作，是因为他们单纯地追求完成产量计划，认为机械维修工作要侵占生产时间。但是，他们这种错误做法所造成的后果是机器大量毁损，事故增多。这不但浪费了国家财富，而且也影响了生产；更严重的是，这还使工人对使用机电设备发生顾虑，阻碍采煤机械化程度的迅速提高。我认为，这个矿的领导人员所采取的是一种“杀鸡取蛋”的生产方法，必须加以纠正。刘正民
