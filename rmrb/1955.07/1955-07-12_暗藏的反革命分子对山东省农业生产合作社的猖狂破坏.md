Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries' Rampant Sabotage of Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Shandong Province
    Yu Xiyao

    In recent years, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong Province has greatly developed. There are now more than 91,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, and the number of farmer households participating in the cooperatives accounts for about 20 percent of the total number of households in the province. With the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the class struggle in the countryside has become increasingly acute and complex. Landlord class elements, reactionary rich peasants, and other counter-revolutionary elements are doing everything possible to sabotage the agricultural production cooperatives.

    The enemy's methods of sabotaging agricultural production cooperatives are extremely insidious and vicious, and are becoming increasingly rampant. In the early stages of establishing cooperatives, they mostly used the conservative and backward psychology and spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some farmers to spread rumors such as "after joining the cooperative, land and property will be collectivized," "land remuneration will be cancelled, and those without labor power will starve to death," and "the grain harvested will be divided equally among households," causing farmers to misunderstand the Party and government's policies on mutual aid and cooperation, and increasing their concerns about joining the cooperatives. These rumors did confuse some farmers, causing some who had already joined the cooperatives to request withdrawal.

    During the process of establishing cooperatives, counter-revolutionary elements pretended to be active, or bought over and won over cadres and the masses, gained trust, and took advantage of the fact that some cooperatives did not strictly examine their members during the rapid development of mutual aid and cooperation to sneak into agricultural production cooperatives, using conspiracies and tricks to usurp the leadership of the cooperatives, and seize important positions such as cooperative director, accountant, and warehouse keeper. Then they adopted internal dismantling methods to carry out various sabotage activities in a planned way. Ma Shanji, a reactionary rich peasant in Caijiazhuang, Jiyang County, instructed his wife to seduce the village branch secretary, and instructed his daughter to seduce party member Ren Yueqin. Then he sneaked into the agricultural production cooperative and became the accountant. Zhang Jixiang, who had been a Japanese translator in Huayuan Village, Eleventh District, Jiaoxian County, applied to join the cooperative but was not approved. He pretended to be active, often cleaning the streets, carrying water for the cooperative director (who was also the township head), and sweeping the courtyard. Finally, he sneaked into the cooperative. Soon after joining the cooperative, he incited the members to replace the director, saying that "the director participates in less labor," "the director is useless, doesn't understand anything, our cooperative can't harvest grain, and in the autumn we'll ask the director for food!" and so on, causing confusion among the members for a time. Huang Ronggang, who had been a puppet army officer in Huangmeng Village, Fourteenth District, Shouguang County, sneaked into the agricultural production cooperative, colluded with reactionary landlords and bandits who had been released from prison, held secret meetings continuously, and incited the members to jointly file a complaint with the district, demanding the removal of the director, in an attempt to usurp the leadership. Zhao Junyi, a puppet village chief in Fengzitun Village, Tenth District, Jiaoxian County, sneaked into the agricultural production cooperative led by Yang Guilan as a technician. He seized on the shortcomings of the director's somewhat rigid work style, colluded with bad elements, fabricated charges that the director was corrupt, shielding counter-revolutionaries, and oppressing and exploiting the masses, and actively organized the members to expose her, claiming that whoever stood on Yang Guilan's side would be as ugly as Yang Guilan after she was overthrown. Due to Zhao Junyi's sabotage, Yang Guilan was forced to commit suicide by taking poison (but was rescued), and the agricultural production cooperative suffered losses of more than a thousand yuan in production and other aspects, seriously disrupting production. Even more insidious is the organization of fake agricultural production cooperatives by counter-revolutionary elements in order to cover up their criminal activities. This kind of fake cooperative has occurred in Linqu, Gaomi, and other places.

    In order to hinder the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the enemy even used terrorist means to assassinate agricultural production cooperative workers and activists, in order to create chaos and threaten farmers to withdraw from the cooperatives. On June 8th, when more than 20 members of the Yihezhuang Central Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District of Liangshan County were sharpening their sickles to cut wheat in the wheat field, Song Lianyuan, a counter-revolutionary element who had sneaked into the cooperative, used a sickle to kill the deputy director Meng Guang'en, and wounded the militia captain and three others before escaping. The gate of the house of the deputy director of the Lizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in En County was set on fire by the enemy, and a grenade was thrown into the house of the cooperative's accountant (but did not explode). Liu Zhaoshun and Liu Zishun, bad elements who had been expelled from the Wang Shanrenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Heze County, poisoned all seven members of the family of the cooperative director Liu Dongli. These destructive crimes of the enemy seriously endangered the safety of the lives and property of the cooperative members.

    The enemy also carried out sabotage activities such as theft, arson, and poisoning draft animals. Arson is the most prominent of these types of sabotage. More than 50,000 jin of cow grass were burned in the Yanglou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linshu County. More than 30,000 jin of grass were burned in the Liu Shanrenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heze County. Of the major arson cases that occurred this year, there were 39 in the first quarter alone, including nine cases where more than 10,000 jin of grass were burned. On June 5th, during the wheat harvest, 30 mu of wheat were burned in the Qianma Erzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the First District of Yanggu County. 15 mu of wheat and 2,000 jin of bean stalks were burned in the Zhao Longgang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Eleventh District of Linyi County by enemies who committed arson. Cases of theft from agricultural production cooperatives also occur frequently. In April of this year, one rubber-wheeled cart and two cart wheels were stolen from the Taozhuang and Changqian Village Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the Sixth District of Jimo County. Poisoning draft animals is one of the important means used by the enemy to sabotage agricultural production cooperatives, because poisoning livestock can directly affect production. Li Wenzhang, a reactionary rich peasant in Duzhuang, Second District, Gaotang County, sneaked into the cooperative as a feeder, and consistently beat the oxen and mixed soil into the fodder, causing seventeen oxen to become so thin that they could not work. He also once used an axe to kill an ox alive. There are also cases of killing draft animals with metal objects and poisons. For example, an ox in the Hu Peidong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Cuizhuang, First District, Linqing County, was fed in the home of the puppet village chief Hu Wenhuan for one day, and a two-inch long needle was found stuck in the ox's head. When Liu Fapan's mutual aid group in Chenghe Village, Ninth District, Zhucheng County, transferred to the cooperative in January, a landlord element in the group actually put poison in the livestock trough.

    The enemy and reactionary elements also often target important links in the production process for sabotage, affecting the increased production of agricultural production cooperatives. Huang Ronggang, who had been a puppet army company commander who had sneaked into the agricultural production cooperative in Huangmeng Village, Shouguang County, sowed only nine jin of bean seeds per mu last autumn, eleven jin less than the prescribed amount, resulting in a reduction of 600 jin of grain per mu due to lack of seedlings. When planting flue-cured tobacco, the cooperative stipulated that it should be planted with water, but the production team under his control planted one and a half mu dry, and applied twice as much chemical fertilizer, causing half of the flue-cured tobacco to die. When the agricultural production cooperative led by Liu Yonghong in Zhangjia Village, Tenth District, Jiaoxian County, was preparing to plant sweet potatoes, saboteurs destroyed more than 12,000 sweet potato seedlings with salt water. During the drought resistance process, the enemy often sabotaged the water conservancy construction of agricultural production cooperatives. In the Eleventh District of Junan County, four cases of sabotage of waterwheels occurred continuously within three days from May 8th to 10th. During the tense period of drought resistance, cases of sabotage of wells and springs were also continuously discovered in the Second District of Weixian County and the Sixth District of Jiaoxian County. Many counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary elements who have infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives also use their power to embezzle large amounts of public funds. They generally mess up the accounts first, abolish the cash manuals of the members, and then use methods such as recording more than they received and less than they spent, multiple entries, and omissions to embezzle funds, and some even burn the accounts in order to destroy evidence. Gao Lizong (a San Qing Tuan member), the accountant of the Xinzhuang Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Seventh District of Gaomi County, used this method to embezzle more than 350 yuan.

    Counter-revolutionary elements, profiteers, and other bad elements who have infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives also often use the capitalist trends of the small-scale peasant economy to engage in speculative commerce within the cooperatives, causing the agricultural production cooperatives to degenerate, and stealing state property from them. Liu Yanchen, a profiteer, and Yue Xiudong, a puppet army officer, from Lutang, First District, Linqing County, sneaked into the agricultural production cooperative and became the director and accountant. They encouraged the members to raise 800 yuan, and defrauded the state of 300 yuan in loans for cattle trading, and evaded state taxes. The advanced agricultural production cooperative in Lijia Village, Eighth District, Jiaoxian County, was seized by the puppet village chief Li Yunrang, enemy and puppet personnel Li Yunxiang, and others. They engaged in oil mills, kilns, cotton ginning, and other activities in the cooperative, evaded state taxes, and stole 550 jin of bean cake and peanut cake and 77 jin of oil when accepting the task of providing soybean oil and peanut oil to the state, and stole 300 jin of coal when transporting coal to the school. Due to the malfeasance of Li Yunrang and others, the sideline production of this cooperative also lost money, and coupled with the fact that there was little labor and many sidelines in the cooperative, and the agricultural management was poor, the output was lower than that of individual households, resulting in each member household owing 130 yuan, which led to the collapse of the cooperative.

    These situations fully demonstrate that agricultural production cooperatives are the main target of sabotage by various enemies in the countryside, and that as the socialist transformation of agriculture gradually deepens, the enemy will inevitably adopt more cunning and vicious means to carry out more serious sabotage. The main reason why these counter-revolutionary elements, landlord class elements, and reactionary rich peasants are able to infiltrate production cooperatives and blatantly carry out sabotage is that some of our grassroots workers have a complacent and paralyzed attitude towards the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, do not deeply understand the Party's class policies in the countryside, are not clear about the fact that the socialist transformation of agriculture is also a fierce class struggle, are not vigilant enough against the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, landlords, and rich peasants, and do not conduct class education for the masses on a regular basis. Therefore, there is still serious paralysis among many grassroots workers and the masses, and some even mistakenly believe that "rich peasants have strong livestock, many farm tools, can write, can calculate, and have skills," and deliberately absorb rich peasants into the cooperatives. This is a very dangerous practice. In order to ensure the complete victory of the state's socialist transformation of agriculture and the smooth development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's class policies in the countryside, strictly examine the members entering the cooperatives, and resolutely remove the counter-revolutionary elements, landlord class elements, and rich peasant elements who have infiltrated the agricultural production cooperatives.

    暗藏的反革命分子对山东省农业生产合作社的猖狂破坏
    于曦耀
    近几年来，山东省互助合作运动有了很大发展，全省现有农业生产合作社九万一千多个，入社农户已占全省总农户的百分之二十左右。随着互助合作运动的迅速发展，农村阶级斗争也日益尖锐复杂起来，地主阶级分子、反动富农及其他反革命分子正千方百计地对农业生产合作社实行破坏。
    敌人对农业生产合作社进行破坏的手段是极其阴险毒辣的，而且越来越猖狂。在建社初期，他们多利用部分农民的保守、落后心理和自发的资本主义倾向，散布所谓“入社以后土地、财产要归公”，
  “土地报酬要取消，没劳动力的要饿死”，“打的粮食要按户平分”等谣言，使农民对党和政府的互助合作政策发生误解，增加入社的顾虑。这些谣言确曾迷惑过部分农民，因而使有些已经入社的农民要求退社。
    在建社过程中，反革命分子伪装积极，或收买拉拢干部和群众，骗取信任，并利用互助合作大发展时有些合作社对社的成员审查不严的空隙，钻进农业生产合作社内，用阴谋诡计篡夺社的领导权，窃取社长、会计、保管等重要职位，然后采取内部拆台的办法有计划地进行各种破坏。济阳县蔡家庄反动富农马善吉指使他的妻子勾引村支部书记，指使他的女儿勾引党员任月琴，然后他混进了农业生产合作社，并当上了会计。胶县十一区花园村曾当过日本翻译官的张吉祥要求入社没被批准，他就伪装积极，经常打扫街道，给社长（乡长兼）挑水，扫天井，最后混进了社里。入社后不久，他就煽动社员撤换社长，说什么“社长参加劳动少”，“社长不顶事，什么也不懂，咱社打不了粮食，秋天向社长要吃的！”等等，在社员中一度造成混乱。寿光县十四区黄孟村当过伪军官的黄荣岗混进了农业生产合作社，勾结刑满释放的反动地主、土匪等，连续秘密集会，并煽动社员联名到区控告，要求撤换社长，企图篡夺领导权。胶县十区丰子屯村伪保长赵俊义混进杨桂兰领导的农业生产合作社当技术员，抓住社长工作作风有些生硬的缺点，勾结坏分子，捏造社长贪污、包庇反革命、欺压剥削群众等罪名，积极组织社员检举，并声言谁要站在杨桂兰那边，把杨桂兰打倒以后他就要和杨桂兰一样难看。由于赵俊义的破坏，杨桂兰被逼服毒自杀（遇救未死），农业生产合作社在生产等方面损失达千元以上，严重地破坏了生产。更阴险的是反革命分子为掩盖其罪恶活动而组织假生产合作社。这种假社，在临朐、高密等地都有发生。
    敌人为了阻碍互助合作运动的发展，更用恐怖手段暗害农业生产合作社工作人员和积极分子，以便造成混乱，威胁农民退社。六月八日，梁山县五区义合庄中心农业生产合作社二十多名社员正在麦田磨镰刀割麦子，混进社内的反革命分子宋连元用镰刀把副社长孟广恩砍死，并砍伤民兵队长等三人之后逃跑。恩县李庄农业生产合作社副社长家大门被敌人放火，该社会计家中被扔进手榴弹（未炸）。菏泽县三区王善人庄农业生产合作社被开除出社的坏分子刘兆顺、刘子顺，曾向社长刘东礼全家七口人放毒。敌人的这些破坏罪行严重危害了社员生命财产的安全。
    敌人还进行偷盗、纵火、暗害耕畜等破坏活动。这类破坏以纵火为最突出。临沭县阳楼村农业生产合作社被烧牛草五万多斤。菏泽县刘善仁庄农业生产合作社被纵火烧草三万多斤。今年发生的重大的纵火案件，仅第一季度就有三十九起，其中烧草一万斤以上的有九起。六月五日麦收期间，阳谷县一区前马二庄农业生产合作社被放火烧掉小麦三十亩。临邑县十一区赵龙岗农业生产合作社被敌人纵火烧掉小麦十五亩，豆秸两千斤。农业生产合作社被盗案件也经常发生。即墨县六区陶庄和长阡村两个农业生产合作社今年四月份被盗胶轮车一辆、车轮两个。毒害耕畜是敌人破坏农业生产合作社的重要手段之一，因为毒害了牲畜，就可以直接影响生产。高唐县二区杜庄反动富农李文章混进合作社内当饲养员，一贯毒打耕牛，在草料内掺土，使十七头牛瘦得不能干活，他还曾用斧子把一条牛活活砍死。也有用金属品、毒品杀害耕畜的。如临清县一区崔庄胡培东农业生产合作社的牛，在伪保长胡文焕家中喂了一天，就发现牛头上插有二寸长的大针一根。诸城县九区城河村刘发潘互助组一月份转社时，组内一地主分子竟在牲口槽里投放了毒药。
    敌人和反动分子也常常针对生产过程中的重要环节进行破坏，影响农业生产合作社的增产。寿光县黄孟村混进农业生产合作社的当过伪军连长的黄荣岗，在去年秋天种豆时，每亩下种九斤，比规定少十一斤，使土地因缺苗减产六百斤；栽黄烟时，社里规定要水栽，他掌握的生产队却旱栽一亩半，并多施化学肥料二分之一，使黄烟死掉一半。胶县十区张家村刘永洪领导的农业生产合作社准备栽红薯时，破坏分子用盐水把一万二千多棵红薯秧全部毁坏。抗旱过程中，敌人又往往破坏农业生产合作社的水利建设。莒南县十一区五月八日到十日三天内，即连续发生破坏水车案件四起。潍县二区、胶县六区在抗旱紧张时期，也都连续发现破坏水井、水泉的案件。许多钻进农业生产合作社的反革命分子和反动分子，还利用职权大量贪污公款。他们一般都是先把账目弄乱，废除社员的现金手册，再用收多记少、支少记多、复记、漏记等手段进行贪污，有的甚至为毁灭证据而把账目烧掉。高密县七区辛庄曙光农业生产合作社会计高立宗（三青团分子）就用这种办法贪污了三百五十多元。
    混进农业生产合作社的反革命分子、奸商和其他坏分子，也常常利用小农经济的资本主义趋势，在社内从事投机商业，使农业生产合作社变质，并从中盗窃国家资财。临清县一区吕堂奸商刘延臣、伪军官岳修动混入农业生产合作社当了社长和会计，他们鼓动社员集资八百元，又骗取国家贷款三百元作贩牛买卖，并偷漏国税。胶县八区李家村先进农业生产合作社，被混入的伪保长李云让、敌伪人员李云祥等窃取了社的领导权。他们在社内大搞油坊、窑厂、弹花等，偷漏国税，并在接受给国家榨豆油和花生油的任务时，从中窃取豆饼、花生饼五百五十斤、油七十七斤，给学校运煤时，从中盗煤三百斤。由于李云让等人营私舞弊，这个社的副业生产还赔了钱，又加社内劳力少、副业多，农业经营管理不善，产量低于单干户，使每户社员负债一百三十元，结果把社搞垮。
    这些情况充分说明，农业生产合作社是各种敌人在农村进行破坏的主要目标，而且随着对农业实行社会主义改造的逐步深入，敌人必然会采取更加狡猾和毒辣的手段进行更加严重的破坏。这些反革命分子、地主阶级分子和反动富农所以能够混入生产合作社并明目张胆地进行破坏，主要是我们有些基层工作人员对反革命分子的破坏有太平麻痹思想，对党在农村的阶级政策领会不深刻，对于农业的社会主义改造同样是场激烈的阶级斗争认识不明确，对反革命分子和地主、富农的破坏警惕性不高，对群众没有经常进行阶级教育，所以在不少基层工作人员和群众中还有严重的麻痹思想，甚至有人错误地认为“富农牲口强、农具多、能写、会算、有本领”，而故意吸收富农入社。这是非常危险的做法。为了保证国家对农业实行社会主义改造的彻底胜利，保证互助合作运动的顺利发展，必须坚决贯彻党在农村的阶级政策，严格审查入社成员，并把已经混进农业生产合作社的反革命分子、地主阶级分子、富农分子坚决清洗出去。
