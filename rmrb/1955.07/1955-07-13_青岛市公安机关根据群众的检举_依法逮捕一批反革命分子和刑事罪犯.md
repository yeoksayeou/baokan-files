Following the concentrated arrest and punishment of a batch of hooligans and bandits in Qingdao from June 15th to 23rd, the people of the city have become even more active in reporting criminal elements such as hooligans and bandits, as well as remaining counter-revolutionaries. After investigation and verification by the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, these criminals have been lawfully arrested.

The arrested remaining counter-revolutionaries are mostly criminals with numerous crimes and immense popular resentment. For example, the traitor Yang Shengshan once served as the section chief of the Japanese puppet secret service and a translator for the Japanese military police. He was one of the "Three Great Mountains," notorious bullies in the Taidong District of Qingdao during the Japanese puppet regime. He colluded with the Japanese to harm the people and patriotic anti-Japanese individuals, and relying on the power of the Japanese, he extorted and seized civilian property and raped women. The criminal Sun Bingxian, when he served as the Security Commander of the Jiang thief's special zone in 1941, sent Jiang thief troops to kill farmers in Zhifang Village, Heze County, who were resisting exorbitant taxes and levies, burned down farmers' houses, and repeatedly directed Jiang thief troops to harm many of our revolutionary comrades. In 1946, when Sun was the chief of the Jiang thief's police bureau in Qingdao, he actively cooperated with the Jiang thief's "Garrison Headquarters" in counter-revolutionary activities, persecuting revolutionary personnel and progressive individuals. The criminal Zhu Zhanjun served as a councilor in the Japanese puppet Zhang Zongyuan's department, a "liaison commissioner for the suppression of communists in the Mutsu Rikugun unit" of the Japanese, and a "deputy commander for the suppression of communists" of the Jiang thief. He extensively carried out pro-Japanese and anti-communist, anti-people propaganda in Pingdu, Changyi, Shouguang, and Guangrao areas of Shandong. In 1947, when the Jiang thief army attacked our Jiaodong Liberated Area, Zhu actively raised funds to purchase munitions and organized "homecoming corps."

Among the arrested counter-revolutionaries, some are die-hard reactionary leaders of secret societies. After the government explicitly banned reactionary secret society organizations, these criminals not only refused to register or made false registrations but also frequently spread "change of dynasty" ideas, created rumors to confuse the public, and vainly attempted to restore the old order. For example, the criminal Wang Jishan, the "Kaifa Master" of the reactionary Taoist sect Houtian Jiugong Dao, not only engaged in false registration to deceive the People's Government but also prevented his younger brother, Wang Jilin (a reactionary Taoist leader), from registering with the People's Government to start anew. He also funded other Taoist leaders to flee and go into hiding, vainly hoping to rise again. Li Jiyao, the "Kaifa Master" of Houtian Jiugong Dao, who refused to register, entered into an alliance with other Taoist leaders, concealed their organization, destroyed evidence of their crimes, and frequently spread rumors and "change of dynasty" ideas.

The arrested criminal offenders are all habitual thieves, pickpockets, swindlers, and hooligans who seriously endanger social order. Some were caught in the act by the masses. For example, the criminal Xu Yingjie, a habitual thief who had infiltrated the joint state-private Yongyu Salt Company, stole 240 yuan from the mutual aid fund of the transportation workshop of the company on June 20th, just as the people of Qingdao were angrily condemning criminal offenders. He was immediately apprehended by the employees and handed over to the public security organs.

    青岛市公安机关根据群众的检举
    依法逮捕一批反革命分子和刑事罪犯
    青岛市在六月十五日到二十三日集中地逮捕、惩处了一批流氓盗匪分子之后，全市人民更加积极地检举流氓盗匪等刑事犯罪分子和残余的反革命分子。青岛市人民政府公安局经过调查证实，已依法把这批罪犯逮捕。
    被逮捕的残余反革命分子，大都是罪恶多端、民愤极大的罪犯。如汉奸杨圣山，曾当过日伪特务股长、日寇宪兵队翻译，是日伪时期青岛市台东区著名恶霸“三大山”之一，曾勾结日寇残害人民和抗日爱国人士，并依仗日寇势力，敲诈、霸占民财，奸污妇女。罪犯孙秉贤一九四一年当蒋贼专区保安司令时，曾派蒋贼军杀害菏泽县芝房村抗缴苛捐杂税的农民，烧毁农民的房屋，并多次指挥蒋贼军，残害我革命同志多人；一九四六年孙犯在青岛任蒋贼警察局局长时，积极配合蒋贼“警备司令部”进行反革命活动，迫害革命人员和进步人士。罪犯祝占俊，曾任日伪张宗援部的参议、日寇“睦陆关部队剿共联络专员”及蒋贼“剿共副司令”等反动职务，在山东平度、昌邑、寿光、广饶一带大肆进行所谓“中日亲善”等卖国和反共、反人民的宣传。一九四七年蒋贼军进攻我胶东解放区时，祝犯又积极募款购买军火，组织“还乡团”。
    在逮捕的这批反革命分子中，有些是怙恶不悛的反动道会门头子。这些罪犯在政府明令取缔反动道会门组织后，不但拒不登记或进行假登记，并经常散布“变天”思想，造谣惑众，妄图复辟。如罪犯王集山，是反动道门后天九宫道的“开法师”，他不但进行假登记欺骗人民政府，而且阻止其弟王集林（反动道首）向人民政府登记自新，并资助其他道首外逃潜伏，妄想待机再起。拒不登记的后天九宫道“开法师”李继尧，同其他道首订立同盟，隐蔽组织，毁灭罪证，并经常造谣，散布“变天”思想。
    被逮捕的刑事罪犯，都是严重危害社会治安的惯盗、惯窃、骗子手及流氓恶棍等，有的是正在做案时当场被群众捕获的现行犯。如罪犯许英杰，是混进公私合营永裕盐业公司的惯窃，六月二十日，正当青岛市人民愤怒声讨刑事犯罪分子之际，许犯竟又盗窃该公司搬运车间互助金二百四十元，当场被职工扭送公安机关。
