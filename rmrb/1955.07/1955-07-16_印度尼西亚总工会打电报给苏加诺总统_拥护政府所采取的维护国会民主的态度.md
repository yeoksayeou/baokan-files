Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 15th. According to a report in the Indonesian "People's Daily" on the 13th, the National Council of the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the President, government, and parliament of Indonesia on the 12th, expressing its endorsement of the government's attitude in maintaining parliamentary democracy.

The telegram stated that Indonesian workers unanimously support a system that conforms to the spirit and substance of the Indonesian Provisional Constitution, namely, a parliamentary democratic system. The telegram also stated that the Indonesian working people oppose military dictatorship and presidential cabinets because they would conflict with the Provisional Constitution and endanger the democratic freedoms of the working people in their struggle for a better life. The telegram pointed out that the attempt to establish a military dictatorship in the "October 17 Incident" of 1952 was condemned by all Indonesian workers.

The National Council of the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor called on all Indonesian workers to unite more closely to confront attempts to oppose parliamentary democracy.

The Executive Committee of the Indonesian Plantation Workers' Union and the Executive Committee of the Railway Workers' Union also sent similar telegrams to the Indonesian President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Parliament, supporting the government's attitude in maintaining the principles of parliamentary democracy and opposing military dictatorship.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 15th. According to newspaper reports, the domestic situation in Indonesia has become more tense and complex as reactionary forces try to take advantage of the appointment of a new Army Chief of Staff to overthrow the Sastroamidjojo government.

Rendunowu, chairman of the Progressive faction in Parliament, announced at a press conference held in Jakarta on the 14th that the Progressive faction had withdrawn Defense Minister Kusumasumantri from the cabinet on the evening of the 13th.

According to Antara News Agency, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo will temporarily act as Minister of Defense.

However, the opposition is insisting that the entire Sastroamidjojo government resign and is plotting various conspiracies against the government to achieve this goal.

Masjumi Party leader Wibisono issued a statement advocating that Vice President Hatta organize a presidential cabinet to replace the current government.

Several influential mass organizations and newspapers have expressed opposition to the establishment of a presidential cabinet, because such a cabinet carries the danger of establishing a military dictatorship in the country.

    印度尼西亚总工会打电报给苏加诺总统
    政府所采取的维护国会民主的态度
    新华社雅加达十五日电　据印度尼西亚“人民日报”十三日报道，印度尼西亚总工会全国理事会在十二日打电报给印度尼西亚总统、政府和国会，表示拥护政府所采取的维护国会民主的态度。
    电报说，印度尼西亚工人一致支持符合印度尼西亚临时宪法内容的精神和实质的制度，即国会民主制度。电报又说，印度尼西亚劳动人民反对军事独裁和总统内阁，因为它们将同临时宪法相抵触，并且会危害劳动人民为争取美好的生活而进行斗争的民主和自由。电报指出，在一九五二年“十月十七日事件”中想要建立军事独裁的企图曾遭到全体印度尼西亚工人的谴责。
    印度尼西亚总工会全国理事会号召全体印度尼西亚工人更紧密地团结起来，对付反对国会民主的企图。
    印度尼西亚种植园工人工会执行委员会和铁路工人工会执行委员会也打了类似的电报给印度尼西亚总统、总理和国会议长，支持政府所采取的维护国会民主原则和反对军事独裁的态度。
    新华社雅加达十五日电　据报纸消息，印度尼西亚国内局势由于反动势力力图利用任命新的陆军参谋长事件推翻沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府而更趋紧张和复杂化。
    国会中的进步系主席伦度诺乌十四日在雅加达举行的记者招待会上宣布，进步系已在十三日晚上把国防部长库素马素曼特里从内阁中撤回。
    据安塔拉通讯社获悉，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理将暂时代理国防部长的职务。
    但是，反对派硬要沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府全体辞职，并且策划各种反对政府的阴谋来实现这个目的。
    马斯友美党领袖维比索诺发表了一项声明，主张副总统哈达组织总统内阁来代替现政府。
    一些有影响的群众组织和报纸已表示反对成立总统内阁，因为这种内阁有使在这个国家内建立军事独裁的危险。
