Governments and Public Opinion in Various Countries Attach Importance to Sino-US Talks
Eden and the British Foreign Office

British Prime Minister Eden, in a report to the House of Commons on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit on the 27th, welcomed the Sino-US agreement to begin ambassadorial-level talks in Geneva on August 1. Eden said that "the situation in the Far East is far more dangerous than in Europe," and that "we should all hope for the success of the talks. The talks can be a useful beginning." The British government is "pleased to have played some part in these developments."

A British Foreign Office spokesman commented on the Sino-US agreement to hold ambassadorial-level talks on the 25th, saying that the British Foreign Office believes that "this is a welcome development and hopes that this new contact on specific issues will help to ease tensions between China and the United States."

U Nu

Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said in a statement to the press on the 27th that the Sino-US talks to be held in Geneva on August 1 were "a major step towards world peace."

U Nu said: "I strongly feel that the proposed Geneva talks are merely the forerunners of promising things to come, and I fully endorse Senator George's suggestion that the next logical step is a meeting of foreign ministers." "I expect the Geneva talks to make the work of subsequent foreign ministers' meetings easier."

Senator George, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Walter George, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, said again on the 26th that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States and the People's Republic of China must be held.

He told reporters that the ambassadorial-level talks between the US and China beginning on August 1 might help "clear the atmosphere" for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries to discuss Far Eastern issues.

George said he believed that "in my opinion, the only talks that will produce good results are those that involve direct contact with Zhou Enlai and other senior officials of their government."

American Newspapers

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" said in an editorial that the Sino-US Geneva talks were "an auspicious sign" and "of paramount importance." The newspaper said that Senator George's proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of the US and China was "appropriate and timely." The editorial said: "The meeting with Beijing must discuss specific issues such as Jinmen, Mazu, Taiwan and the future recognition of Beijing by the United States."

"New York Post" reporter Lash commented that if the talks go smoothly and further discuss broader issues, "the talks may be taken over by the foreign ministers of the two countries," which would be the case according to George's proposal. "Baltimore Sun" editorial believes that the talks in Geneva are a "significant shift."

The "Philadelphia Inquirer" said that holding talks in Geneva was a "dramatic and necessary consequence" of the Four-Power Summit. At the same time, the newspaper said: "This does not mean that we recognize the Chinese communist regime."

British Newspapers

Many British newspapers expressed the hope that direct negotiations between representatives of China and the United States would help normalize relations between the two countries.

The "Yorkshire Post" published an article by its diplomatic commentator Adam saying that the Sino-US talks were "an extremely encouraging step that helps open the door to further easing tensions in the Far East." "It is hoped that what they will achieve is to remove the mutual distrust between the United States and China, which has been deeply undermining relations between the two countries." "A better atmosphere created may pave the way for tackling more important issues."

The "Star" pointed out that tensions in the Far East can never be eliminated until the United States recognizes the established fact that the People's Republic of China was founded, just like Britain did. The newspaper said that the government of the People's Republic of China "now rules China, and it, not Chiang Kai-shek, should have a seat in the United Nations."

The "Scotsman" wrote that one of the most encouraging results of the Four-Power Summit was that China and the United States will hold ambassadorial-level talks in Geneva. The newspaper said: Initially, it was only pointed out that the main purpose of the meeting would be to discuss the issue of Americans detained in China, but now Dulles says that the scope of the talks will be broader. The United States is prepared to discuss with China issues directly related to both parties.

Hungarian "Free People's Daily"

The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" commented on the agreement between China and the United States to hold ambassadorial-level negotiations on the 28th, saying that the very fact of holding negotiations between the two countries helps to further ease international tensions and strengthen the peace aspirations of people all over the world. The newspaper said that the whole world received this news with great satisfaction. The "Free People's Daily" called on the forces of peace to continue their constant struggle in order to promote positive results in the Sino-US negotiations, because there are still obstacles on the road to reaching an agreement, and these obstacles are not small.

Indian Newspapers

The "Times of India" said on the 27th: "The upcoming negotiations will be a noteworthy event. This negotiation will be the first independent diplomatic contact between the two countries, and will undoubtedly be the first step towards further consultations on the political issues of the East."

The "Hindustan Standard" wrote: "This resumption of direct ambassadorial-level talks between the United States and Beijing is some progress towards a diplomatic reconciliation." The newspaper hopes that the talks "can open up further prospects for negotiations on larger issues such as the recognition of China and the future of Taiwan."

The "Indian Express" said: "India and Burma's patient efforts to bring the United States and People's China together have achieved their first results." "Although the talks appear to have limited objectives on the surface, they have full potential implications for the future." The newspaper hopes: "Once the negotiations proceed amicably, the issues involved will be resolved more or less satisfactorily, and then it will reach the point where an agreement can be reached on how to explore other issues." The newspaper also said, "This meeting may prove to be the first step towards easing the tensions existing between the United States and People's China." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    各国政府人士和舆论重视中美会谈
    艾登和英国外交部
    英国首相艾登二十七日在下院报告日内瓦四国政府首脑会议结果时，对中美两国协议八月一日开始在日内瓦举行大使级会谈表示欢迎。艾登说，“远东局势比欧洲局势危险得多”，“我们大家都应该希望会谈顺利。会谈是可以成为一个有益的开端的”，英国政府“由于曾经在这些发展中起了一些作用而感到高兴”。
    英国外交部发言人二十五日曾就中美关于举行大使级会谈的协议发表评论说，英国外交部认为，“这是一个值得欢迎的发展，并且希望这次就具体问题进行的新接触将有助于缓和中国和美国之间的紧张局势”。
    吴努
    缅甸总理吴努二十七日在向报界发表的一项声明中说，将在八月一日在日内瓦举行的中美会谈是“世界走向和平的一大步”。
    吴努说：“我强烈地感觉到，拟议中的日内瓦会谈只是未来的有希望的事情的先驱，我充分赞成参议员乔治的建议：下一个合乎逻辑的步骤是外交部长级的会议。”“我期望日内瓦会谈将使随后的外交部长会议的工作较易进行。”
    美国参院外委会主席乔治
    美国参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人华尔特·乔治在二十六日又一次说，必须举行美国和中华人民共和国的外交部长会议。
    他对记者们说，八月一日开始的美中两国大使级会谈可能有助于“澄清气氛”，以便召开两国外交部长会议来讨论远东问题。
    乔治说，他认为，“在我看来，唯一会产生良好结果的会谈就是同周恩来和他们的政府的其他高级官员直接进行接触的会谈。”
    美国报纸
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在社论中认为美中两国日内瓦会谈是“一个吉兆”，“具有头等重要意义”。这家报纸说，参议员乔治提出的举行美中两国外交部长会议的主张是“适当和适时”的。社论说：“同北京的会议必须讨论如金门、马祖、台湾和美国在将来承认北京等具体问题。”
    “纽约邮报”记者拉希评论说，如果会谈顺利进行，进而讨论较为广泛的问题，“会谈可能由两国外长接手进行”，要是根据乔治的主张，情况就会是这样。“巴尔的摩太阳报”社论认为，在日内瓦的会谈是“意义深长的转变”。
    “费城问询报”说，在日内瓦举行会谈是四国最高级会议的“戏剧性的和必要的后果”。同时，这家报纸又说：“这并不意味着我们承认中国的共产党政权。”
    英国报纸
    英国许多报纸都表示希望：中美两国代表之间的直接谈判将有助于两国关系的正常化。
    “约克郡邮报”刊载它的外交评论员亚当的一篇文章说，中美会谈是“有助于打开远东紧张局势进一步缓和的大门的极为令人鼓舞的步骤”。“人们期望，他们将获致的是去除美国和中国之间的互不信任心理，这种心理一直在深刻地破坏着两国之间的关系。”“通过所酿成的较好的气氛或许可以为着手处理更重大的问题扫清道路。”
    “明星报”指出，在美国没有像英国一样承认中华人民共和国成立这一个既成的事实以前，远东的紧张局势是永远不可能消除的。这家报纸说，中华人民共和国政府“现在统治着中国，是它，而不是蒋介石，应当在联合国中占有席位”。
    “苏格兰人报”写道：四国政府首脑会议最令人鼓舞的结果之一就是中美两国将在日内瓦举行大使级会谈。报纸说：起初仅仅是指出，会议的主要目的将是讨论被拘禁在中国的美国人的问题，但是现在杜勒斯说，会谈的范围将更为广泛。美国准备同中国讨论同双方直接有关的问题。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”
    匈牙利“自由人民报”二十八日就中美两国举行大使级谈判的协议发表评论说，举行两国间的谈判这一事实本身即有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强世界各国人民的和平愿望。这家报纸说，全世界都以极满意的心情接待这个消息。“自由人民报”要求和平力量继续进行不断的斗争以便促使中美谈判获得积极的结果，因为在达成协议的道路上仍然存在着障碍，而且这些障碍并不小。
    印度报纸
    “印度时报”二十七日说：“即将来到的谈判将是一个值得注意的事件。这次谈判将是两国之间第一次独立的外交接触，并且无疑将是走向关于东方的政治问题的进一步协商的第一个步骤。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”写道：“美国和北京之间这次恢复大使级的直接谈判是趋向于一种外交和解的某种进展。”这家报纸希望：会谈“能为关于中国的被承认和台湾的前途等较大的问题的谈判开拓进一步的前景。”
    “印度快报”说：“印度和缅甸使美国和人民中国共聚一堂的耐心的努力已经获得了第一个成果”。“这次会谈虽然外表上看来是目的有限的，但是却对将来具有充分的潜在影响”。这家报纸希望：“一旦谈判进行得很友好，所涉及到的问题将或多或少地得到满意的解决，然后就将达到这样的地步：能够达成关于探讨其他问题的方法的协议。”报纸并且说，“这次会谈可能证明是走向存在于美国和人民中国之间的紧张局势的缓和的第一步。”　（据新华社讯）
