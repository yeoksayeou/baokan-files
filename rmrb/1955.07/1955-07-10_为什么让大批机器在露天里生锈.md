　　Why are Large Quantities of Machines Allowed to Rust in the Open Air?

Editor:
    At the state-owned Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, there is a huge open-air warehouse filled with a large number of machines. There are fourteen steam pumps, four blowers, one boiler, two ovens, and one rotary machine, as well as a large number of transformers, reaction tanks, filters, cotton gins, steam rollers, etc., and a large number of various machines whose types and numbers are difficult to ascertain; it is said that the total value is more than one million yuan. Some of these machines are usable, and some only need minor repairs to be used; but they have been left in the open air for a long time, exposed to the wind and rain, and many have rusted beyond recognition.
    Machines have been accumulating in the open-air warehouse since 1951. As early as 1953, workers suggested to the factory management to build a reed mat shed to store the machines, and the Shenyang Daily also published a reader's letter criticizing this phenomenon of poor machine maintenance; however, the problem was not resolved. In 1954, I raised the issue with the materials section, and the section chief replied that "it is being studied for resolution." Until now, a large number of machines are still in the open air, unresolved.

### 为什么让大批机器在露天里生锈

　　为什么让大批机器在露天里生锈编辑同志：
    在国营东北制药总厂，有一个巨大的露天仓库，里面堆积着大批机器。这里有十四台汽泵、四台送风机、一台锅炉、两台烘箱和一台回转机，有大批变压器、反应罐、过滤器、打棉机、轧汽机等，还有大批种类和数字已经不易搞清的各式机器；据说总值在一百万元以上。这些机器，有的是能用的，有的只要稍加修理就能使用；但是长期放在露天，任凭风吹雨淋，有不少已经锈得不像话了。
    从一九五一年开始露天仓库就积压了机器。早在一九五三年，工人们就向厂部建议搭个芦席来存放机器，沈阳日报也发表读者来信批评了这种保管机器不善的现象；但是问题并没有解决。一九五四年，我曾向材料科提过意见，科长的答复是“正在研究处理”。直到现在，大批机器还放在露天没有处理。
