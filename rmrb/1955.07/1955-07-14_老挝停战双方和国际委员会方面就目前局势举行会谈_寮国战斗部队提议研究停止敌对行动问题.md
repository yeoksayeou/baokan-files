Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: News from Laos states that on July 11th, the military delegations of the Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao Royal Government, as well as the military group of the Lao International Supervisory and Monitoring Committee, held talks on the current situation in Laos. During the talks, the military delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces proposed that the issue of ceasing hostilities in the Muong Phanh area should be studied. The Royal Government side stated that it would study this proposal before replying.

The military conference between the Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao Royal Government, which began on June 27th, was stalled due to a unilateral request from the Royal Government side, at a time when the Royal Army was intensifying its offensive in the Muong Phanh area. At that time, the Royal Government informed the Lao Fighting Forces that its negotiating representative could not attend the meeting because he was "unwell."

    老挝停战双方和国际委员会方面就目前局势举行会谈
    寮国战斗部队提议研究停止敌对行动问题
    新华社河内十三日电　从老挝来的消息说，七月十一日，寮国战斗部队和老挝王国政府双方的军事代表团以及老挝国际监督和监察委员会军事小组就老挝目前的局势进行了会谈。在会谈中，寮国战斗部队军事代表团提议应当研究停止芒奔地区的敌对行动的问题，王国政府方面表示对这个建议要加以研究后再答复。
    寮国战斗部队和老挝王国政府方面从六月二十七日开始举行的军事会议，在王国军队加紧进攻芒奔地区的时候曾由于王国政府方面的片面要求而陷于停顿。当时，王国政府方面通知寮国战斗部队说它的谈判代表因为“不舒服”而不能出席会议。
