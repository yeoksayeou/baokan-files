Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued today, with thirty-two deputies and heads of various departments of state organs speaking at the meeting.

    The speakers were: Ye Jizhuang, Mao Yisheng, Zhu Dehai, Li Minghao, Shen Dejian, Hu Juewen, Li Chenggan, Li Dequan, Hu Yaobang, Feng Yunhe, Pei A’qian, Cheng Xiaogang, Xi Zhongxun, Chen Yuan, Tao Shufan, Zhao Cunxin, Cui Jiangong, Shi Liang, Yang Xiufeng, Deng Baoshan, Chen Jingshe, Huang Jiasi, Wang Kun, Lu Han, Li Yong, Zhang Chong, Huo Weide, Geng Changsuo, Sun Dehe, Chen Yongkang, Sun Zuobin, and Xie Rao Dengzhu.

    Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang spoke on the situation of China's foreign trade at the meeting. He said that with the needs of China's economic construction, China's foreign trade has had and will have great development. According to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, the imported materials within five years are primarily equipment and important materials needed for the 156 industrial construction units designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union; secondly, the equipment necessary for various industries, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy; and also imports of some light industrial raw materials that are not produced or are insufficiently produced domestically, and some daily necessities. Ye Jizhuang said that China must use export materials to exchange for the imported materials needed for construction. Export is for import, and import is for the country's socialist industrialization. At present, the export of various materials is not much, and the export of grain and oils is limited. In the coming years, the export of grain will be maintained at the 1953 level, and edible vegetable oil will be maintained at the 1954 level. The main exported commodities are native products, animal products, special products, etc., and the export quantity of many native products has not reached the pre-war export level. For these things that have little relation to the people's lives, domestic consumption should be appropriately economized to ensure export needs, in exchange for a large number of machinery and equipment to support national industrialization.

    Ye Jizhuang described China's trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. He said that the growth rate of trade volume in recent years has been very fast. This trade is entirely based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual cooperation, and is carried out according to the needs and possibilities of both sides. This new type of international trade relations plays a great role in promoting the common economic upsurge of all countries in the socialist camp. Through foreign trade, the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union, have given China tremendous assistance.

    Ye Jizhuang said that China's trade relations with Southeast Asian countries have had new developments in 1954. We are also actively carrying out trade with Asian and African countries. He said: We firmly believe that developing this trade will have a great positive effect on improving the lives of the people of all countries, promoting peaceful coexistence, and enhancing understanding and friendship between governments and peoples of all countries. He said that although trade with Japan has gradually developed in recent years, due to the Japanese government's continued implementation of the US's "embargo" policy, the current trade volume is not only far from the pre-war level, but also has not recovered to the 1950 level. We hope this situation will change.

    Ye Jizhuang said that China's trade with Western countries once had considerable development after liberation. Due to the obstruction of the US imperialist "blockade" and "embargo," the trade volume once declined in the second half of 1951. However, because China has consistently adhered to the policy of developing normal international economic affairs relations, and many business people in Western countries have increasingly experienced that adopting trade restrictions and discriminatory policies is first and foremost detrimental to them, China's trade volume with Western countries rebounded significantly in 1953. If they can truly take measures to eliminate artificial obstacles hindering peaceful trade, the prospect of China further developing trade with them in the future will be very great.

    Deputy Mao Yisheng said that the development of scientific research work requires a longer time, while the Five-Year Plan's requirements for scientific research are very urgent. He believes that the following appropriate measures must be taken to eliminate this contradiction: (1) Give full play to the role of human and material resources in existing scientific research institutions, avoid duplication and waste, strengthen weak links, and establish economic accounting ideas among research workers; (2) Firmly establish a system of scientific research serving production, determine the service objects of each research institution, and strengthen coordination and cooperation; (3) Open the doors of scientific research institutions to technological innovators in enterprises, so that they can complete their technological innovation work in a scientific research environment; (4) Ensure that the research work of universities and colleges still serves production and construction through teaching; (5) Expand the activities of various specialized societies of natural sciences to cooperate with research work in production; (6) Link the inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals in various enterprises with relevant scientific research work.

    In his speech, Deputy Zhu Dehai, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province, wholeheartedly supported the First Five-Year Plan. He said that the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is a region mainly engaged in agricultural production, and the focus of economic development should be agricultural production. They will vigorously carry out agricultural production increase work in accordance with the general spirit and provisions of the First Five-Year Plan.

    Deputy Li Minghao spoke on the production and disaster relief work in Hubei Province over the past year. He said that Hubei Province suffered a once-in-a-century flood last summer, and since late November, it has suffered two consecutive cold waves and heavy snow attacks. However, such a severe natural disaster was finally overcome. He said that this should first of all be attributed to the close care and wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao; and to the strong support of all parts of the country. The state's socialist transformation of agriculture, especially the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, has created extremely favorable conditions for production and disaster relief work; at the same time, the vast number of district and township cadres and activists have always stood at the forefront of the flood prevention and disaster relief struggle, together with the disaster-stricken people, regardless of day and night, wind and rain, sharing joys and sorrows and sharing hardships, forming a huge force, so that they were able to overcome the severe natural disaster.

    Deputy Shen Dejian said that the dawn of socialist construction has illuminated all corners, and traditional Chinese medicine has also gained the attention of the Communist Party and the People's Government. The People's Government's correct policy towards traditional Chinese medicine will mobilize all Chinese medicine practitioners across the country to participate in the great people's cause, and every Chinese medicine practitioner feels infinite excitement and infinite glory. He said that in the future, we must learn more from Western medicine and get more help from Western medicine, so as to complete the glorious task of sorting out and improving Chinese medicine.

    Deputy Hu Juewen recalled his past "industrial salvation" ideal and said that under the dual oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, his enterprise was "dying," and "industrial salvation" became a dream. Since liberation, his enterprise has improved production, overcome difficulties, and played a positive role beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood after the state processed and ordered goods and implemented joint state-private ownership. Hu Juewen said that today the state is implementing the First Five-Year Plan to develop industrial construction as the center, realizing the common aspiration of the people of the whole country for a long time, proving that only by embarking on the road of socialist industrialization can we turn a poor and weak China into a truly prosperous and strong China.

    Deputy Li Chenggan said that the "unifying the national system of weights and measures; establishing a regular calibration system for measuring instruments and meters and a unified product inspection system" stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan are necessary measures to realize the industrial production plan. He said that China's system of weights and measures is extremely chaotic. At present, unifying the system of weights and measures is an urgent matter. We must learn from the Soviet Union, learn and do at the same time, so that the country's measurement work can be on track as soon as possible.

    Minister of Health Li Dequan's speech focused on reviewing the mistakes made by the Central Ministry of Health in the past on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine. She said that there are still hundreds of thousands of Chinese medicine practitioners in China, which is a huge force in the health team. Traditional Chinese medicine does have good curative effects on many diseases, and traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated many years of experience in treating diseases. However, some responsible persons in the health department believe that traditional Chinese medicine is "unscientific" and adopted a discriminatory and exclusionary policy towards traditional Chinese medicine, violating the party and the state's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. This is a reflection of bourgeois ideology in the health department. She said that we must continue to fight this erroneous ideology in the future and strive to develop the precious medical heritage of the motherland. Li Dequan also mentioned that in addition to improving the work of traditional Chinese medicine, the health department should also do a good job in higher medical education, improve the management of industrial hygiene, pay attention to rural health work, and strictly manage infectious diseases that are more harmful to people's health. Li Dequan said that the most important thing is to educate medical staff and the vast number of health cadres to study Marxism-Leninism well, overcome bourgeois ideology, improve the quality of medical technology, and serve socialist construction wholeheartedly.

    Deputy Hu Yaobang's speech talked about the issue of cultivating the younger generation. He said that there are currently 186 million young people in China, of whom 100 million are already working on various fronts of the motherland, and the vast majority of the remaining 86 million are studying, that is, actively preparing to work for the motherland. If we better cultivate this new force and link this force with the strength of the entire people, all our undertakings will have the most reliable guarantee. He said that we hope that national staff at all levels and all those who love the future of socialism will all better care for the growth of China's younger generation. In particular, we must care about the growth of their communist ideas, qualities, and morals.

    Feng Yunhe, a deputy from Shandong Province, believes in his speech that it is entirely correct to stipulate in the draft Five-Year Plan that the artificial fiber industry should be established and the linen spinning industry should be developed on the basis of restoring and developing the production of silk, wool and hemp. She said that in order to develop the artificial fiber industry, it is necessary to develop the pulp industry it requires accordingly; in order to develop the linen spinning industry, it is necessary to expand the area of hemp cultivation accordingly. She also put forward many suggestions on increasing textile raw materials and trial-producing artificial fibers.

    Pei A’qian, a deputy from Yunnan Province, said that their Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture is located on the southwestern border, with a vast area and sparse population. The people of all ethnic groups live between cliffs and steep walls. Due to the long-term oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionary ruling classes, they lived a backward and poor life. He said: After liberation, the Communist Party led us to implement ethnic regional autonomy, and the production and life of the people of all ethnic groups have undergone great changes. The health center provides free medical treatment to the people of all ethnic groups; several post roads have been repaired, industrial products are continuously transported in, and native products are sold smoothly; the government has distributed many loans and agricultural implements, and improved farming techniques. He said that the people of all ethnic groups, facing these new scenes, watched and watched, thought and thought, and thought that this was unprecedented happiness, which they could not dream of. But just like they climbed over the mountains and ridges, after discussing the Five-Year Plan this time, he felt that this mountain was higher than that mountain, and he saw a more beautiful vision.

    Cheng Xiaogang, a representative of scientific and technological workers, said that it is very important to do a good job in basic work in everything. The heavy rolling mill and heavy forging press themselves are only a few meters high, but the foundation is more than ten meters deep; any house or bridge building must start from the foundation. He believes that the Chinese people have a fine tradition of diligence and thrift, and they also have the wisdom to plan for the long term. They will certainly not hesitate to temporarily reduce some material requirements and do a good job in the heavy industry foundation for the country's socialist construction. Cheng Xiaogang said that our scientific and technological workers must study hard, work hard, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, improve our professional level and political and ideological level, and gradually complete the tasks assigned to us by the state.

    Secretary General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun focused on the issue of streamlining state organs in his speech. He first pointed out that streamlining state organs and reducing state administrative expenditures is an important national policy, a necessary means to practice economy and accumulate construction funds, and a powerful measure to improve the work of state organs and ensure the victorious advance of the national construction cause. He then pointed out: At present, many unreasonable phenomena have arisen and been exposed in the upper-level leading organs of the state, that is, overlapping institutions, huge staffing, redundant personnel, low work efficiency, and chaotic work order, which also promote the occurrence and development of bureaucracy and red tape. If these phenomena are not corrected in a timely and resolute manner, they will inevitably cause serious damage to the cause of national construction.

    Xi Zhongxun said: In January of this year, under the instruction of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong, the State Council established a staffing and wage committee to be responsible for presiding over the work of streamlining state organs, and decided to first implement the policy of streamlining institutions, tightening staffing, and adjusting cadres in the central organs. After several months of work, it has been proven that state organs should and can be more streamlined, and personnel can be reduced. Moreover, judging from the achievements already made, the effect is very good.

    Xi Zhongxun said: Correctly handling the personnel transferred out during the streamlining process is the most important link in thoroughly doing a good job in streamlining, and a serious and responsible attitude must be adopted to effectively do this work well. Xi Zhongxun especially emphasized that the personnel transferred out during the streamlining process are the state's valuable property, and they will all be used more rationally or receive necessary resettlement, so that they can play a greater role in the national construction cause.

    Xi Zhongxun finally said that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have decided to gradually carry out streamlining work nationwide and strengthen staffing management work. Not only administrative leading organs at all levels should be streamlined, but also enterprises and institutions should be streamlined. We must resolutely implement the central government's policy, conscientiously promote streamlining work, and combine it with the development of the conservation movement, carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, improve the style of leadership work, improve the work efficiency of state organs, and strive to victoriously complete the First Five-Year Plan.

    Deputy Chen Yuan's speech focused on two issues: cultivating construction cadres and strengthening scientific research work. He said that our universities and colleges are responsible for training cadres for the country who are technically good, physically healthy, and, first of all, politically reliable. We must ensure that students' knowledge, physique, and politics all reach a certain quality. Therefore, our teaching must implement the educational policy of all-round development. He said that in the future, educators will continue to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and scientific research work, so that scientific research can be effectively combined with teaching and the needs of national construction.

    Tao Shufan, a model primary school teacher, said that the task of all primary school teachers in our country is to cultivate well-rounded new people for the motherland and builders and defenders of socialist society. In order to accomplish this glorious and arduous task, all primary school teachers must actively participate in the country's political life, participate in the current struggle to criticize bourgeois ideology, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the country's guidelines and policies, and resolutely oppose educating students with bourgeois viewpoints and methods. At the same time, we must resolutely expose and eliminate all counter-revolutionaries lurking in the educational ranks.

    Zhao Cunxin, a deputy from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, talked about how the people of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture have become more closely united day by day between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups since the implementation of regional autonomy, and their material and cultural lives have been continuously improved and improved. He especially mentioned that the recent approval by the Central Committee of the Dai script program jointly improved by the Academy of Sciences and the Yunnan Nationalities Affairs Commission for trial implementation in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture will enable the cultural and educational undertakings in Xishuangbanna to develop more rapidly.

    Army representative Cui Jiangong pointed out in his speech that with the development of economic construction, China's national defense construction has also been further developed. Now the army's weapons and equipment have been greatly improved, and the material supply is more abundant. The formulation of the First Five-Year Plan and the Military Service Law has created very favorable conditions for the modernization of national defense, and all commanders and fighters of the army feel infinitely excited and encouraged. He believes that the solid material foundation of national industrialization and the well-trained active and reserve personnel will greatly enhance the people's army's will and determination to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and defend peace.

    Minister of Justice Shi Liang said: The more victorious the socialist construction cause is, the more the enemy will fail. They try to escape the fate of death and will inevitably carry out various sabotage activities against our country's construction cause madly. However, because we have insufficient understanding of the current class struggle situation and the enemy's sabotage, we are blindly intoxicated with the past achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the great victory of national construction, so we turn a blind eye to the above situation, and there is a widespread right-leaning pacifist paralysis thought of not arresting those who should be arrested, not sentencing those who should be sentenced, and sentencing serious crimes lightly. This phenomenon of ineffective strikes, lenient punishments, and untimely handling of counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders is extremely harmful to the country and the people. She said that these errors have been seriously reviewed and criticized at the judicial work symposium in June of this year, and requested that people's courts at all levels immediately and resolutely correct them.

    Shi Liang said: After the First Five-Year Plan is adopted at this meeting, state organs and the people of the whole country must make their own contributions to the realization of this plan. The judicial organs must cooperate with the public security and procuratorial organs to resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders, and continue to punish embezzlers, thieves, and those responsible for major accidents that constitute criminal responsibility and those who seriously violate labor discipline, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of the First Five-Year Plan.

    Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng's speech focused on how to improve the quality of higher education. He pointed out that in order to adapt to the needs of national construction and train qualified senior construction talents, higher education work in the future must pay attention to greatly improving quality, especially to improving political quality. To this end, we should first implement the policy of "ensuring quality and taking care of quantity," improve enrollment work, and improve the quality of freshmen. In the future, freshmen admitted to universities and colleges must be politically reliable, able to keep up with their studies, and have health conditions that can persist in learning. Students in schools should also be rectified according to current requirements.

    Yang Xiufeng said that continuously strengthening Marxism-Leninism education is the fundamental method to cultivate the correct world outlook of young people, improve their socialist awareness, and enhance their resistance to the erosion of bourgeois ideology. He also pointed out that the students' thinking is inseparable from the influence of the teachers' thinking. In order to improve the quality of teaching, the ideological transformation of teachers is particularly important.

    Yang Xiufeng said that through the recent struggle to expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we can see the seriousness of the attack by hidden counter-revolutionaries on schools. Higher education workers should use this struggle to raise their political awareness and greatly advance political and ideological work, and thoroughly eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    Deng Baoshan, the governor of Gansu Province, pointed out in his speech based on his understanding of the situation during his inspection of rural areas that the peasants warmly support the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. They call the unified sale of grain "three insurances," which means insurance of grain, no price increase, and no exploitation. He said that as long as we continue to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale and the "three fixed" measures, do a good job in ideological education, and combat all counter-revolutionary activities, the grain tension in some areas can be eliminated. He also explained that the lives of farmers are improving day by day based on key survey materials in various parts of Gansu.

    Deputy Chen Jingshe said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, private industrialists and businessmen have found a way to transition to socialism, which is the path of state capitalism. Through state capitalism, private industrialists and businessmen can not only carry out enterprise transformation, but also obtain opportunities for personal transformation. He said that we private industrialists and businessmen must correctly understand the significance of the government's overall arrangement, honestly obey the national plan, consciously strive for further transformation, and advance together with the great motherland.

    Deputy Huang Jiasi said in his speech that the people's health care cause will have great development in the First Five-Year Plan. To complete this task, medical workers must first do a good job in the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. In 1957, the number of doctors in our country was 390,000, of which 324,000 were Chinese medicine practitioners, and only 66,000 doctors were trained by medical schools. It is impossible to rely solely on 66,000 Western doctors to protect the health of more than 25 million workers and more than 500 million rural people. Only with the addition of 324,000 Chinese medicine practitioners can we become a strong medical team. He said that the preliminary results of Western medicine studying traditional Chinese medicine in recent years have proved that many methods of traditional Chinese medicine are scientific and effective. In the future, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine must further unite and learn from each other. Huang Jiasi also pointed out in his speech that cultivating new forces and improving the scientific level of existing cadres are also urgent tasks of current medical work.

    Wang Kun, a representative of music workers, said in his speech that we should launch a new singing movement in the great era of socialist construction, use our voices to sing about the cause of our people, and let our songs truly become pleasant sounds and advancing sounds in the lives of construction and struggle. In her speech, she also talked about the importance of music workers improving their political and ideological and professional levels. She said that what is hindering the development of our art cause now is the impurity of the art team in ideology and organization. Therefore, the guidance of Marxist-Leninist ideology is extremely important and absolutely necessary for the music work team.

    Deputy Lu Han said in his speech that China's First Five-Year Plan is the gospel of the 600 million people of China and a symbol of our path to prosperity and well-being. Only under the people's power led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we have full confidence in realizing this great plan. Lu Han suggested that grassroots cadres and cadres of agricultural production cooperatives should employ as many demobilized construction soldiers as possible in rural areas; the wages of construction workers should be stipulated according to their actual living needs; and individual households in rural areas should be helped to do a good job in production, their education should be strengthened, and attention should be paid to guiding them to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    Li Yong, a railway labor model, said that in order to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Five-Year Plan, our railway workers must work hard in the following aspects: (1) Resolutely implement comprehensive conservation, oppose all waste, and carry out labor competitions in depth; (2) On operating railways, we must further carry out the movement of full load, over-axle, and 500 kilometers; (3) In new railways and capital construction, we must further carry out labor competitions with good, economical, fast, and safe results. Li Yong also proposed that railway workers should strengthen labor discipline, study hard, and improve technology in labor competitions.

    Deputy Zhang Chong said in his speech that Yunnan is a multi-ethnic province, and the social development of all ethnic groups is extremely unbalanced. In recent years, due to the implementation of the policy of prudence, stability, and progress, and unity, production, and progress, ethnic unity has been enhanced, the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups has been improved, and the social situation is gradually changing. Zhang Chong pointed out that Yunnan is located on the border of the motherland, and the situation is relatively complicated. To complete the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to carry out more meticulous and stable work and extremely arduous and complicated struggles. We must pay attention to overcoming the arrogance and complacency that currently exist among cadres, raise vigilance, and strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries.

    Huo Weide, a deputy from Gansu Province, expressed in his speech the warm support and support of the people of Gansu Province for the great plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River flood and develop the Yellow River water conservancy. He said that the people of Gansu Province are determined to make efforts to do a good job in various tasks related to the control of the Yellow River under the unified planning and leadership of the central government, especially to do a good job in water and soil conservation, to support and ensure the realization of this great plan. At the same time, we must strive to do a good job in the preparation for the relocation of people in the reservoir area. As for the people who need to be relocated to Gansu in other reservoir areas, we will definitely give them necessary help in production and life.

    Geng Changsuo, an agricultural labor model, explained in his speech that the road of agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation is the road for peasants to get rid of poverty forever with the increasingly developing facts of the agricultural production cooperative he led in Wugong Township. He said that organizing is strength. The agricultural production cooperative in Wugong Township is already a large cooperative of 419 households. In the past, the land in Wugong Township could produce at most 200 jin of grain per mu, but now it can receive more than 400 jin of grain. He also talked about how the material and cultural lives of the members have been improved with the development of production. Geng Changsuo said that their cooperative plans to increase the output of grain, cotton, and other crops by about 22 percent this year compared with last year, and to support the country's socialist industrialization with more grain and industrial raw materials.

    Deputy Sun Dehe said in his speech that he was deeply moved by the great plan of the Five-Year Plan on the scale of heavy industry development and the fundamental control of the Yellow River. He believes that designers should not only ensure that they study technology diligently from Soviet experts, learn advanced Soviet science, but also learn the ideological style and working methods of Soviet experts, and actively improve socialist design ideas. He said that only through long-term diligent study and work, accepting criticism, and correcting shortcomings can we ensure that we can complete the glorious tasks that designers should undertake in the several five-year plans in the process of building socialism.

    Chen Yongkang, a deputy from Guizhou Province, believes in his speech that the Five-Year Plan is in line with the long-term interests and immediate interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. He said that from the spirit of the Five-Year Plan, the ethnic minority areas in Guizhou should take the development of the mutual assistance and cooperation agricultural production increase movement as the center and increase the production of grain and other technical crops to support national industrialization. He said that taking the road of mutual assistance and cooperation is the basic link for the ethnic minorities in Guizhou Province to change from backward to advanced.

    Sun Zuobin, a deputy from Qinghai Province, said that the development of the Qaidam Basin is a major issue directly related to the development of China's national economy and the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. He said: We have listed supporting the exploration of the Qaidam Basin as one of the main tasks in 1955. Cadres at all levels and people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are excited that the country has started to develop the Qaidam Basin, and they have shown very active enthusiasm in supporting the work.

    Xie Rao Dengzhu said in his speech that supporting and assisting the People's Liberation Army and staff who entered Tibet, doing a good job in the current work in the Tibet region, and the various construction projects that the State Council decided to help the local government of Tibet are in line with the country's entire construction plan, and at the same time, they are laying the foundation for further building a new Tibet. He said that the unity between the Tibetan and Han people and cadres is an indispensable and important condition for building Tibet. To gradually develop the construction cause in the Tibet region, it is necessary to vigorously train local ethnic cadres.

    The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Liu Bocheng, Xu Teli, Chen Jiageng, Yang Mingxuan, Ou Baichuan, Hua Luogeng, Li Chengjun, and Hu Yaobang.

    Today's meeting began at 3:00 pm and adjourned at 7:15 pm. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

专栏：

    全国人民代表大会代表继续发言
    新华社二十九日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天继续举行，三十二位代表和国家机关各部门负责人在会上发言。
    发言的人有：叶季壮、茅以升、朱德海、李明灏、沈德建、胡厥文、李承干、李德全、胡耀邦、酆云鹤、裴阿欠、程孝刚、习仲勋、陈垣、陶淑范、召存信、崔建功、史良、杨秀峰、邓宝珊、陈经畬、黄家驷、王昆、卢汉、李永、张冲、霍维德、耿长锁、孙德和、陈永康、孙作宾、协饶登珠。
    对外贸易部部长叶季壮就我国对外贸易情况在会上发言。他说，随着我国经济建设发展的需要，我国对外贸易已经有了并且还将有很大的发展。根据五年计划建设的要求，五年内进口的物资，首先是苏联帮助我国设计的一五六项工业建设单位所需的设备和重要器材；其次是其他各项工业、交通运输、农林水利所必需的器材；同时也进口一部分国内不生产或生产不足的轻工业原料和一部分日用生活必需品。叶季壮说，我国必须用出口物资来换回建设所需的进口物资。出口是为了进口，进口是为了国家的社会主义工业化。目前各种物资的出口是并不多的，粮食和油脂是限量出口的，今后各年出口粮食将维持在一九五三年的水平，食用植物油将维持在一九五四年的水平。主要出口的商品是土产品、畜产品、特产品等，并且许多土产品的出口数量还没有达到战前出口水平。对这些同人民生活关系不大的东西，应当适当节约国内消费，保证出口需要，以换回大量的机器设备，支援国家工业化。
    叶季壮叙述了我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易情况。他说，几年来贸易额增长速度是很快的。这种贸易是完全建立在平等互利和互助合作的基础上，并根据双方需要与可能进行的。这种新型的国际贸易关系，对促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨有很大作用。通过对外贸易，苏联和各人民民主国家，特别是苏联给我国以巨大的援助。
    叶季壮说，我国同东南亚国家的贸易关系，一九五四年有了新的发展。对亚非国家的贸易，我们也正在积极进行。他说：我们深信发展这种贸易对改善各国人民生活，促进和平共处，增进各国政府之间和人民之间的了解和友谊，都有很大的积极作用。他说，对日本的贸易近几年来虽然逐步有了发展，但由于日本政府仍在执行美国的“禁运”政策，因此目前的贸易额不但距离战前的水平很远，而且也未恢复到一九五○年的水平。我们希望这种情况有所改变。
    叶季壮说，我国同西方国家的贸易，解放后曾一度有过相当的发展。由于美帝国主义“封锁”“禁运”的阻挠，一九五一年下半年贸易额曾一度下降。但由于我国一贯坚持发展正常国际经济事务关系的政策，和西方国家的许多工商界人士日益体验到采取贸易限制和歧视政策首先而且主要的是对他们不利，因此一九五三年我国与西方国家的贸易额又有了较大的回升。如果他们能够真正采取措施消除妨碍和平贸易的人为障碍，今后我国同他们进一步发展贸易的前途将是很大的。
    茅以升代表说，科学研究工作的发展需要更长久的时间，而五年计划对于科学研究的要求则是非常迫切的。他认为必须采取下列适当的措施来消除这个矛盾：（一）充分发挥现有科学研究机构中人力物力的作用，避免重复浪费，加强薄弱环节，并在研究工作人员中树立经济核算思想；（二）牢固地建立科学研究为生产服务的制度，确定每个研究机构服务对象，并加强配合协作；（三）使科学研究机构为企业中的技术革新者开门，使他们能在科学研究的环境中，完成他们的技术革新工作；（四）使高等学校的研究工作，通过教学，仍然表现为生产建设服务；（五）扩大自然科学各专门学会的活动，来配合生产中的研究工作；（六）使各企业中的创造发明及合理化建议同各有关的科学研究工作联系起来。
    朱德海代表在发言中代表吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区的各族人民衷心地拥护第一个五年计划。他说，延边朝鲜族自治区是一个以农业生产为主的地区，发展经济的重点应该是农业生产，他们将按照第一个五年计划的总精神和规定，大力做好农业增产的工作。
    李明灏代表就湖北省一年来的生产救灾工作发言。他说，湖北省去年夏季遭受了百年仅有的大洪水，十一月下旬起，又接连遭受两次寒潮大雪的袭击。但是，这样严重的自然灾害终于被战胜了。他说，这首先应当归功于中央和毛主席的亲切关怀和英明领导；归功于全国各地的大力支援。国家对农业的社会主义改造，特别是粮食统购统销政策的贯彻执行，给生产救灾工作创造了极为有利的条件；同时，广大的区、乡干部和积极分子始终站在防汛救灾斗争的最前列，与灾民群众一起，不分昼夜风雨，同甘苦、共患难，形成了一个巨大的力量，因而得以战胜了严重的自然灾害。
    沈德建代表说，社会主义建设的曙光，照亮了一切角落，中医也获得了共产党和人民政府的重视。人民政府对于中医的正确政策，将动员全国中医师共同参加伟大的人民事业，每一个中医师都感觉到无限兴奋和无限光荣。他说，今后必须多向西医学习，多得西医帮助，才可以完成整理、提高中国医学的光荣任务。
    胡厥文代表回忆了他过去一直向往的“实业救国”理想说，在帝国主义和官僚资本主义双重压迫下，他所经营的企业已是“奄奄一息”，“实业救国”也成了梦想。解放以来，他的企业经过国家加工定货和实行公私合营以后，才改进了生产，克服了困难，发挥了有利于国计民生的积极作用。胡厥文说，今天国家要实行发展以工业建设为中心的第一个五年计划，实现了全国人民长期以来的共同愿望，证明只有走向社会主义工业化的道路，才能把贫弱的中国变成真正富强的中国。
    李承干代表说，第一个五年计划所规定的“统一全国度量衡；建立量具和计器定期校正制度和统一的产品检验制度”，是实现工业生产计划的必要措施。他说，我国的度、量、衡制度是极为混乱的，目前统一度量衡是一件迫不及待的事，必须以苏联为师，边学边做，使国家的计量工作早日走上轨道。
    卫生部部长李德全的发言着重对中央卫生部过去在中医问题上所犯的错误进行了检查。她说，中国目前还有几十万的中医，是卫生队伍中一支巨大的力量。中医对许多疾病，确有良好的疗效，几千年来中医积累了许多治病的经验，可是卫生部门中有些负责人认为中医“不科学”，对中医采取歧视和排挤的政策，违反了党和国家对中医的政策。这是一种资产阶级思想在卫生部门中的反映。她说，我们今后一定要对这一错误思想继续进行斗争，为发扬祖国的宝贵医学遗产而努力。李德全并谈到，除了改善中医工作，卫生部门今后还应办好高等医学教育，改善工业卫生的管理，注意农村的卫生工作，对危害人民健康更大的传染病严加管理。李德全说，最重要的是要教育医务人员和广大的卫生干部很好地学习马克思列宁主义，克服资产阶级思想，提高医疗技术质量，全心全意地为社会主义建设服务。
    胡耀邦代表的发言谈到培植年轻一代的问题。他说，我国现有青少年一万万八千六百万人，他们当中有一万万人已经在祖国各个战线上劳动着，其余的八千六百万人中的绝大部分在学习，也就是正在积极准备为祖国劳动。如果我们更好地培植这支新生力量，并把这支力量和整个人民的力量联结起来，我们的一切事业，就有了最可靠的保证。他说，我们希望各级国家工作人员，希望一切热爱社会主义前途的人们，大家都来更好地关心我国年轻一代的成长。特别要关心他们的共产主义思想、品质和道德的成长。
    山东省代表酆云鹤在发言中认为，五年计划草案中规定在恢复和发展丝、毛、麻生产的基础上，建立人造纤维工业，发展麻纺工业，是十分正确的。她说，要发展人造纤维工业就必须相应地发展它所需要的纸浆工业；要发展麻纺工业，就必须相应地扩大种麻面积。她并对增加纺织原料和试制人造纤维的工作提出许多建议。
    云南省的裴阿欠代表说，他们怒江傈僳族自治区地处西南边疆，地广人稀，各族人民居住在悬崖陡壁之间，由于过去长期受帝国主义及国内反动统治阶级的压迫，过着落后、贫困的生活。他说：解放后共产党领导我们实行了民族区域自治，各族人民的生产和生活起了很大的变化。卫生院给各族人民免费治病；修好几条驿道，工业品源源运来，土产品畅销出去；政府发放了许多贷款和农具，改进了耕作技术。他说，各族人民面对着这些新景象，看了又看，想了又想，想到这是旷古未有的、做梦也想不到的幸福。但是正像他们爬山越岭一样，这次讨论五年计划以后，他觉得这山更比那山高，看到了更美好的远景。
    科学技术工作者程孝刚代表说，凡事做好基础工作很重要，重型轧钢厂、重型锻压机的本身只几公尺高，但基础却深达十几公尺；任何房屋或桥梁建筑都必需先从基础做起。他认为，我国人民有克勤克俭的优良传统，又有善于长远打算的智慧，一定会不惜暂时减少一些物质要求，而为国家的社会主义建设搞好重工业的基础。程孝刚说，我们科学技术工作者一定要努力学习，努力工作，彻底清除资产阶级思想残余，提高业务水平和政治思想水平，逐步完成国家交给我们的任务。
    国务院秘书长习仲勋在发言中着重谈到关于精简国家机关的问题。他首先指出：精简国家机关，缩减国家行政开支，是国家的一项重要政策，是厉行节约、积累建设资金的必要手段，又是改进国家机关工作、保障国家建设事业胜利前进的有力措施。他接着指出：目前国家上层领导机关中产生了和暴露了许多不合理的现象，这就是，机构重叠，编制庞大，人浮于事，工作效率不高，工作秩序紊乱，同时也就助长了文牍主义、官僚主义现象的发生和发展。这些现象如果不及时地坚决地加以纠正，势必对于国家建设事业造成严重损害。
    习仲勋说：今年一月间，在中共中央和毛泽东主席的指示下，国务院成立了编制工资委员会，负责主持精简国家机关的工作，并决定首先在中央机关贯彻精简机构、紧缩编制、调整干部的方针，经过几个月的工作，证明了国家机关是应当而且可能更加精干的，人员是能够缩减下来的。而且从已经获得的成就来看，效果是很好的。
    习仲勋说：正确地处理精简中抽调出来的人员，是彻底做好精简工作最重要的环节，必须采取认真负责的态度，切实地把这项工作做好。习仲勋特别强调地说，在精简中抽调出来的人员，是国家宝贵的财产，他们都将得到更合理的使用，或者得到必要的安置，因而可以在国家建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
    习仲勋最后说：中共中央和国务院已经决定要逐步地在全国范围内开展精简工作，加强编制管理工作，不仅各级行政领导机关要精简，企业、事业单位也要精简。我们必须坚决贯彻中央的方针，认真推行精简工作，并结合开展节约运动，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，改进领导工作作风，提高国家机关的工作效率，为胜利完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    陈垣代表的发言着重谈到关于培养建设干部和加强科学研究工作两个问题。他说，我们高等学校要负责给国家培养出技术好、身体健康，而且首先是政治上可靠的干部。要使同学们的知识、体格和政治都达到一定的质量。所以我们教学一定要贯彻全面发展的教育方针。他说，今后教育工作者还要继续加强马克思列宁主义的学习和科学研究工作，做到科学研究切实结合教学，结合国家建设的需要。　
    模范小学教师陶淑范代表说，我国全体小学教师的任务是为祖国培养全面发展的新人，培养社会主义社会的建设者和保卫者。为了完成这一光荣而又艰巨的任务，全体小学教师必须积极参加国家政治生活，参加当前批判资产阶级思想的斗争，努力学习马克思列宁主义和国家的方针政策，坚决反对用资产阶级的观点和方法教育学生。同时，必须坚决揭发和消除暗藏在教育队伍中的一切反革命分子。
    来自西双版纳傣族自治州的召存信代表谈到西双版纳傣族自治州的各族人民，在实行了区域自治以后，各族人民之间和民族内部一天比一天地更加紧密地团结起来了，物质生活和文化生活也得到了不断改善和提高。他特别谈到，最近中央批准西双版纳傣族自治州试行由科学院和云南民族事务委员会协助改进的傣文方案，将使西双版纳的文化教育事业得到更迅速的发展。
    军队代表崔建功在发言中指出：随着经济建设的发展，我国的国防建设也有了进一步的发展，现在部队的武器装备已大大地改善，物资供应也更加充分。第一个五年计划和兵役法的制定，已为国防现代化创造了非常有利的条件，部队的全体指战员都感到无限地兴奋和鼓舞。他认为国家工业化的雄厚的物质基础以及训练有素养的现役兵员和预备役兵员，将大大地增强人民军队保卫祖国、解放台湾、保卫和平的意志和决心。
    司法部部长史良说：社会主义建设事业愈加胜利，敌人就愈加失败，他们企图逃脱死亡的命运，必然要疯狂地对我们国家的建设事业进行各种破坏活动。但是，我们由于对当前的阶级斗争形势和敌人的破坏认识不足，盲目陶醉于过去的镇反成绩与国家建设的伟大胜利，因而对上述情形就熟视无睹，普遍存在着该捕不捕、该判不判、重罪轻判的右倾太平麻痹思想。这种对反革命分子及其他各种刑事犯罪分子打击不力，惩办不严、处理不及时的现象，给予国家和人民极大的危害。她说，这些错误已在本年六月司法工作座谈会上认真地作了检查和批判，要求各级人民法院立即坚决纠正。
    史良说：第一个五年计划经这次会议通过后，国家机关和全国人民都必须为实现这个计划而作出自己的贡献。司法机关必须配合公安、检察机关坚决镇压一切反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子，继续惩治贪污、盗窃分子以及构成刑事罪责的重大责任事故和严重违犯劳动纪律的犯罪分子，以保障第一个五年计划的顺利实施。
    高等教育部部长杨秀峰的发言着重谈到如何提高高等教育质量的问题。他指出，为了适应国家建设的需要，培养合格的高级建设人才，今后高等教育工作，必须注意大力提高质量，特别要注意提高政治质量。为此，首先应贯彻“保证质量，照顾数量”的方针，改进招生工作，提高新生质量。今后高等学校录取的新生必须是政治可靠、学业能跟得上班、健康条件能够坚持学习的。对于在学校学生也要根据当前要求，加以整顿。
    杨秀峰说，不断加强马克思列宁主义教育是培养青年正确的世界观、提高社会主义觉悟、增强他们对资产阶级思想侵袭的抵抗力的根本方法。他同时指出，学生的思想同教师的思想影响是分不开的，为要提高教学质量，教师的思想改造就显得特别重要。
    杨秀峰说，通过最近揭发胡风反革命集团的斗争，更可以看到暗藏反革命分子向学校进攻的严重性。高等教育工作者应该通过这次斗争，提高政治觉悟，把政治思想工作大大向前推进一步，彻底清除暗藏的反革命分子。
    甘肃省省长邓宝珊根据他视察农村时了解的情况，在发言中指出，农民对国家粮食统购统销政策是热烈拥护的，他们把粮食统销叫作“三保险”，就是保险有粮、不涨价、不受剥削。他说，只要我们继续贯彻统购统销政策和“三定”措施，作好思想教育工作，并打击一切反革命分子的活动，某些地方的粮食紧张现象就可以消除。他还根据在甘肃各地的重点调查材料，说明农民生活在日益改善。
    陈经畬代表说，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，私营工商业者找到了一条过渡到社会主义的道路，这便是国家资本主义的道路。通过国家资本主义，私营工商业者不但可以进行企业改造，同时也获得了个人改造的机会。他说，我们私营工商业者必须正确认识政府统筹安排的意义，老老实实地服从国家计划，自觉地争取进一步改造，随着伟大的祖国一起前进。
    黄家驷代表在发言中说，第一个五年计划中人民卫生保健事业将有很大的发展，医务工作者要完成这一任务，首先必须做好中西医的团结工作。一九五七年我国医师人数为三十九万人，其中中医师三十二万四千人，受过医学院校训练的医师只有六万六千人，单依靠六万六千个西医来保障二千五百多万个职工和五亿多农村人口的健康是不可能的，只有加上三十二万四千个中医师，才成为一个雄厚的医学队伍。他说，近年来西医学习中医的初步结果，已证明不少的中医方法是有科学根据而且行之有效的。今后中西医必须进一步地团结和互相学习。黄家驷在发言中同时指出了培养新生力量和提高现有干部的科学水平，也是当前医学工作的迫切任务。
    音乐工作者王昆代表在发言中说，我们应该在伟大的社会主义建设时代，展开新的歌咏运动，用我们的声音，歌唱我们人民的事业，让我们的歌声真正成为建设和斗争生活中愉快的声音，前进的声音。她在发言中还谈到音乐工作者提高政治思想和业务水平的重要。她说，现在阻碍我们艺术事业发展的正是艺术队伍在思想上和组织上的不纯，因此，马克思列宁主义思想的指导，对音乐工作队伍来说，是极端重要和绝对必要的。
    卢汉代表在发言中说，我国第一个五年计划，是中国六亿人民的福音，是我们走向富裕康乐道路的标志。只有在共产党和毛主席领导的人民政权之下，才有充分把握实现这个伟大的计划。卢汉建议：基层干部和农业生产合作社的干部，应尽可能多地任用农村中复员建设军人；对建筑工人应按照他们的实际生活需要规定他们的工资；应帮助农村里的单干户搞好生产，加强对他们的教育，注意引导他们加入互助合作组织。
    铁路劳动模范李永代表说，为了保证全面完成和超额完成五年计划给我们规定的光荣任务，我们铁路工人要从以下几方面努力：（一）坚决贯彻全面节约，反对一切浪费，深入开展劳动竞赛；（二）在营业铁路上要进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动；（三）在新建铁路和基本建设方面，更进一步开展好、省、快、安全的劳动竞赛。李永并提出铁路工人在劳动竞赛中要加强劳动纪律，努力学习，提高技术。
    张冲代表在发言中说，云南是多民族省份，各民族社会发展极不平衡，几年来由于贯彻了慎重稳进和团结、生产、进步的方针，增强了民族团结，提高了各族人民的觉悟，社会情况正在逐步发生变化。张冲指出：云南地处祖国边疆，情况比较复杂，完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造任务，需要进行更加细致稳妥的工作和极其艰苦复杂的斗争。要注意克服目前干部中存在的骄傲情绪和麻痹思想，提高警惕，加强同反革命分子的斗争。
    甘肃省霍维德代表的发言，表达了甘肃省人民对根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利这一伟大计划的热烈拥护和支持。他说，甘肃省人民决心在中央的统一规划和领导下，努力做好有关治理黄河的各项工作，特别是要做好水土保持工作，来支持和保证这一伟大计划的实现。同时，要努力做好水库区的移民准备工作，至于其他水库区需要移到甘肃的人民，我们一定在生产和生活上给他们以必要的帮助。
    农业劳动模范耿长锁代表在发言中以他所领导的五公乡农业生产合作社日益发展的事实说明：只有农业互助合作的道路是农民永远摆脱贫困的道路。他说，组织起来力量大。五公乡农业生产合作社已经是四百一十九户的大社，五公乡的土地过去每亩顶多打二百斤粮食，现在能收到四百多斤粮食了。他还谈到随着生产的发展，社员们的物质文化生活也得到改善的情形。耿长锁说，他们社今年粮食、棉花等作物的产量计划要比去年提高百分之二十二左右，要以更多的粮食和工业原料支持国家的社会主义工业化。
    孙德和代表在发言中表示自己深受五年计划关于重工业发展规模和根治黄河的伟大计划所感动。他认为，设计人员不但要保证刻苦地向苏联专家学习技术，学习苏联先进科学，更要学习苏联专家的思想作风与工作方法，积极提高社会主义设计思想。他说，只有通过长期的勤勤恳恳地努力学习和工作，接受批评，纠正缺点，我们才能够保证在建设社会主义过程中的几个五年计划里，完成设计工作者应该承担的光荣任务。
    贵州省的陈永康代表在发言中认为，五年计划是符合我国各族人民的长远利益和眼前利益的。他说，从五年计划的精神来看，贵州少数民族地区应以发展互助合作农业增产运动为中心，多增产粮食和其他技术作物来支援国家工业化。他说，走互助合作道路是贵州省少数民族由落后成为先进的基本环节。
    青海省的孙作宾代表说，开发柴达木盆地，是与发展我国国民经济和青海省各族人民利益直接相关的重大问题。他说：我们已把支援开发柴达木盆地的勘探工作，列为一九五五年主要任务之一。青海省各级干部和各族人民都为国家着手开发柴达木盆地而感到兴奋，他们在支援工作上表现非常积极的热情。
    协饶登珠代表在发言中表示，支援和协助进藏的人民解放军和工作人员，做好西藏地区当前各项工作和国务院决定帮助西藏地方进行的各个建设项目，就是配合了国家的整个建设计划，同时也就是为进一步建设新西藏奠定基础。他说，藏汉两族人民和干部之间的团结，是建设西藏的必不可少的重要的条件。而要逐步发展西藏地区的建设事业，更必须大力培养当地的民族干部。
