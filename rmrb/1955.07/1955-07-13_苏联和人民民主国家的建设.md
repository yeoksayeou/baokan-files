    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    New Achievements of the Soviet Union in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
    Staff members of the Central Laboratory for Physical Methods of Testing Materials Science in the Soviet Union have designed a diagram of an electron cyclotron. It works on the principle of high-frequency reaction. The electron flow obtained using this new principle will reach a thousand times that of usual. Such a strong electron flow can cut metal even without touching it. Currently, the laboratory is also designing a specialized television device to observe gamma-ray and ion streams.
    This laboratory has designed dozens of automatic instruments for checking various production processes. These instruments use isotopes of cobalt, strontium, and other radioactive isotopes as energy sources. One instrument, used to check the wall thickness of steel pipes, can inspect six to seven meters of steel pipe in just a few seconds. If a similar instrument were used on a rolling mill, the operation of the rolls could be fully automated. Gamma-ray flaw detectors have been widely promoted and used. They can penetrate metal up to three hundred millimeters thick.
    In addition, an instrument for the textile industry is of interest. The laboratory uses a specialized device with a vial containing radioactive isotopes to ionize the air inside the loom, preventing the fabric from carrying a charge, thus eliminating the phenomenon of yarn fiber splitting.
    The Molotov Steel Rolling Mill in Leningrad has already begun using radioactive isotopes in the steel rolling production process. During steel rolling, various grades of blanks have their own strict technological regulations, so they must be distinguished by different markings during processing. In the past, a tag was attached to each blank to indicate the grade of steel. Now, the Molotov Steel Rolling Mill has begun using radioactive isotopes to mark various blanks. This type of marking using tracer atoms can withstand the treatment of acidic solutions and heating without falling off. During steel rolling, no matter how fast the blank passes through the rolling mill, its marking can be quickly recorded by a special calculator installed on the rolling mill and reported to the workers through the instrument. This allows the workers to know exactly the grade of the blank being processed and operate smoothly.
    Soviet Building Technology Exhibition Opens in Moscow
    The annual Soviet Building Technology Exhibition opened in Moscow on July 10. The exhibition showcases the outstanding creations of Moscow builders in the past year in the factory production of industrial buildings, residences, and cultural facilities.
    Exhibited items include: new types of prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components for building houses, huge wall panel blocks made of cinder concrete, foam concrete, etc., as well as models of houses made with large wall panels and large blocks, new varieties of cement, and new materials for building roads and bridges. In addition, there are various new types of construction machinery such as tower cranes of different sizes, excavators, bulldozers, and new transport vehicles for transporting large components. The exhibition also features many standard drawings of residential and cultural buildings, and the construction plans for the main streets of Moscow in the last three years.
    Visitors also saw demonstrations of high-efficiency methods for plastering, painting walls, paving, and other decorative work.
    First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, visited the exhibition on the eve of its opening.
    Widespread Thrift Movement Launched by Employees of Various Enterprises in North Korea
    Construction workers at various construction sites in Pyongyang have been widely using a mixed mortar of lime and clay and chalk mortar to plaster walls since this year, saving a large amount of cement. In the past five months, the Pyongyang construction sites under the Construction Bureau have saved enough cement using this method to build two schools with a construction area of over 3,000 square meters each, based on North Korean standard designs.
    Factory employees are working hard to save raw materials and utilize waste materials. Workers in the rolling steel workshop of the Hwanghae Iron Works saved 5.6 percent of steel ingots and 24.6 percent of coking coal in May compared to April. The Pyongyang Rubber Factory saved four tons of raw rubber and more than 600 kilograms of gasoline in the ten days from June 1st to June 10th.
    Train drivers and car drivers in various regions have also launched a movement to save coal and gasoline.
    Vigorous Land Reclamation Movement Unfolds Throughout Vietnam
    A large-scale land reclamation movement is underway throughout Vietnam. Until recently, the area of reclaimed land north of the 17th parallel in Vietnam has reached more than 53,200 hectares, accounting for 39 percent of the total wasteland area of more than 135,000 hectares in northern Vietnam.
    Reclaiming land that has been deserted due to the war is a major task for the Vietnamese people in restoring agricultural production. The policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to help and encourage people to reclaim wasteland have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of farmers. For newly reclaimed wasteland, farmers will be exempt from agricultural tax for three to five years and can receive assistance from the government in terms of loans, seeds, etc.
    According to personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, it is expected that all the wasteland in the plains will be reclaimed by next year. Agricultural machinery from some fraternal countries will soon be transported to Vietnam, so that machinery can be used to reclaim wasteland in the mountainous and forested areas that are more difficult to reclaim.
    Poland Exceeds Fuel Saving Plan for Railways
    Poland's plan to save fuel on railways in the first half of this year has been completed by 101 percent. Some locomotive engineers, due to the extensive use of inferior coal and peat, and frequently filling vehicles to capacity, reduced coal consumption per thousand ton-kilometers of freight transport by 5.5 percent. The best results in fuel saving were achieved by workers on the railway lines of Gdansk Province, who saved 41,000 tons of coal in the first half of the year. Railway lines in Krakow Province also saved 38,000 tons of coal in the first half of the year.
    In terms of railway freight volume, the first half of this year increased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year.
    Romania's Civil Aviation Continues to Develop
    Compared with 1951, the first year of the first five-year plan, the number of passenger and cargo aircraft in Romania has increased by 35.7 percent this year, the number of air passengers has increased by 91.6 percent, and the volume of air cargo has increased by 93.2 percent. Currently, the Romanian capital, Bucharest, has air links with Moscow, Budapest, Prague, Berlin, Sofia, and Warsaw. Within Romania, most of the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the states also have direct air links with Bucharest.
    Albanian Oil Enterprise Completes Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The Albanian Stalin Oil United Enterprise completed its oil extraction plan for the first half of this year five days ahead of schedule, and production costs were further reduced. Workers at the Patos oil well alone saved the country more than 1.26 million lek (Albanian currency) in the first six months of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面的新成就
    苏联中央物理方法试验材料科学研究实验室的工作人员设计了一种电子回旋加速器的图样。它是根据高频率反应的原理工作的。利用这个新原理获得的电子流将达到通常的一千倍。这样强的电子流甚至还没挨近金属就能把金属切断。现在，实验室还正在设计一种专门的电视设备，用以观察丙种射线流和离子流。
    这个实验室已经设计了几十种自动检查各种生产过程的仪器。这些仪器用钴、锶的同位素和其他放射性同位素作为能源。有一种用来检查钢管壁厚度的仪器，只需几秒钟就可以检查六、七公尺长的钢管。如果在轧板机上使用类似的仪器，就可以使操纵轧辊的工作完全自动化。丙种射线疵病检查器已被普遍地推广使用了。它所射透的金属的厚度可达三百公厘。
    此外，还有一种供纺织工业用的仪器很有趣。这个实验室用一种装有放射性同位素的小瓶的专门设备使织机内部的空气电离，而不让织物上带有电荷，可以消除这种纱纤维裂开的现象。
    列宁格勒的莫洛托夫轧钢厂已经把放射性同位素使用到轧钢生产过程中去。在轧钢时，各种品种的毛胚都有自己严格的工艺规程，因此加工时必须用不同的标记把它们区别开来。过去，在各种毛胚上都附上一块号牌，用来标明钢的品种。现在，莫洛托夫轧钢厂开始利用放射性同位素来做各种毛胚的标记。这种采用示踪原子的标记能够耐得住酸性溶液和加热的处理而不脱落。轧钢时，不论毛胚以多快的速度通过轧钢机，它的标记都可以迅速地被轧钢机上装置的一个特殊的计算器记录下来，通过仪器报告工人。这一来，工人们就可以确切地知道被加工的毛胚的品种，顺利地进行操作。
    苏联建筑技术展览会在莫斯科开幕
    苏联一年一度的建筑技术展览会七月十日在莫斯科开幕。展览会展示了莫斯科建筑者们去年一年内在工业建筑、住宅和文化生活建筑的工厂化方面的优秀创造。
    在展览会上展出的物件有：建筑房屋用的新型的装备式钢筋混凝土结构和构件，巨大的矿渣混凝土、泡沫混凝土等制成的壁板砌块，以及用大型壁板和大型砌块造成的房子模型，新品种的水泥和建筑道路和桥梁用的新材料等。此外，还有建筑用的各种新型机器如大小不同的塔式起重机、挖掘机、堆土机和运送大型构件的新式运输工具。展览会还展出了许多住宅和文化生活建筑物的标准图样，和莫斯科在最近三年内主要街道的建筑计划。
    参观者们还看到了涂灰泥、刷墙、铺面和其他各种装饰工作的高效率方法的表演。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在展览会开幕的前夕参观了展览会。
    朝鲜各企业职工普遍展开节约运动
    平壤市各建设工地的建筑工人从今年以来广泛地使用石灰和黏土的混合灰浆和白垩灰浆来抹墙，节省了大量的水泥。在过去的五个月中，建设省所属的平壤市建设工地用这个方法所节省的水泥，就可以供修建朝鲜标准设计建筑面积三千多平方公尺的学校两所之用。
    工厂职工们在努力节约原料和利用废材。黄海制铁所压延钢车间工人在五月份比四月份节约了钢锭百分之五点六，焦煤百分之二十四点六。平壤橡胶工厂在六月一日到六月十日的十天中节约了四吨生胶、六百多公斤汽油。
    各地的火车司机和汽车司机也都展开了节约煤炭和汽油的运动。
    越南各地蓬勃展开开垦荒地运动
    大规模的开垦荒地运动正在越南各地展开。到最近为止，越南十七纬线以北开荒的面积已经达到五万三千二百多公顷，占越南北部地区全部荒地面积十三万五千多公顷的百分之三十九。
    开垦由于战争而荒废的土地是越南人民恢复农业生产工作中的一项主要任务。越南民主共和国政府帮助和鼓励人民开垦荒地的各项政策大大鼓舞了农民的积极性。对于新开垦的荒地，农民将可以免交三年到五年的农业税，并且可以得到政府在贷款、种籽等方面的帮助。
    据农林部人员说，在平原地区的荒地预计到明年就可以全部得到开垦。一部分兄弟国家的农业机械将于不久后运到越南，这样，在比较难于开垦的山林地区的荒地就可以使用机械开垦。
    波兰铁路节约燃料计划超额完成
    波兰铁路今年上半年节约燃料的计划已经完成了百分之一百零一。有些机务员由于大量使用劣质煤和泥煤，并经常使车辆满载，因而使每一千吨公里货运的耗煤量减少了百分之五点五。节约燃料成绩最好的是革但斯克省各铁路线的工人，他们在上半年中节省了四万一千吨煤。克拉科夫省各铁路线在上半年也节省了三万八千吨煤。
    在铁路货运量方面，今年上半年比去年同期增加了百分之十。
    罗马尼亚的民用航空事业不断发展
    同第一个五年计划开始的一年——一九五一年相比，罗马尼亚今年客运和货运飞机数增加了百分之三十五点七，乘飞机的旅客增加了百分之九十一点六，空运的货物的数量增加了百分之九十三点二。目前，罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特已同莫斯科、布达佩斯、布拉格、柏林、索非亚和华沙都有航空线联系。在罗马尼亚国内，大多数州的直辖城市也同布加勒斯特有直接航空线联系。
    阿尔巴尼亚一石油企业提前完成计划
    阿尔巴尼亚斯大林石油联合企业提前五天完成了今年上半年的石油开采计划，生产成本也进一步减低，单是巴托斯油井的工人在今年头六个月就为国家节约了一百二十六万多里克（阿币名）的资金。　（据新华社讯）
