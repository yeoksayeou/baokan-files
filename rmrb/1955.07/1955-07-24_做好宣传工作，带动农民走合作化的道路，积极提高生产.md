    Do a Good Job in Propaganda, Lead Farmers to Take the Road of Cooperation, and Actively Improve Production
    To the Editor:
    I attended the Second Session of the First National People's Congress and listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy." The First Five-Year Plan is an important step in the socialist construction of our motherland. I am determined to dedicate all my strength to completing this plan.
    The First Five-Year Plan has been implemented for more than two years. Facts have proven that the development of industry has indeed brought many benefits to agricultural production. For example, in Liling County, Hunan Province, where I live, sixty-seven pumping stations have been established, solving the irrigation problems of thousands of acres of farmland and generally increasing grain production. Industrial products such as chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and new agricultural implements have also strongly supported farmers' production. These benefits are something that every farmer can appreciate.
    In order to make agricultural production adapt to the development of the entire national economic plan, I think the following things should be noted, and I am determined to do them well:
    1. Strengthen the propaganda and education work among farmers, raise their socialist consciousness, and encourage their enthusiasm for production. Many members of our agricultural producers' cooperatives believe that the cooperative is doing well, and production is increasing year by year, so they feel that everything is almost perfect. Therefore, it is necessary for us to widely and deeply publicize and educate the spirit of the general line and the Five-Year Plan to the farmers, repeatedly clarify the long-term goals of socialism, call on everyone to strive to improve production, and pay attention to the unity of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and lead them to embark on the road of cooperation as soon as possible.
    2. Tell the farmers that socialist construction requires our hard work and must not be enjoyed readymade. At present, the state cannot supply a large number of machines and chemical fertilizers for agricultural use. Therefore, in addition to selling grain and cotton to the state to support industrial construction, we must also rely on our own brains, think of ways to open up fertilizer sources, plant more high-yield crops, etc., to develop production.
    3. During the socialist transformation in the countryside, class enemies are bound to carry out sabotage. We must not be paralyzed and careless. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, expose and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, prevent them from sabotaging our production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and ensure the smooth progress of the motherland's construction.
                Representative of the National People's Congress Li Chenggui

### 做好宣传工作，带动农民走合作化的道路，积极提高生产

    做好宣传工作，带动农民走合作化的道路，积极提高生产编辑同志：
    我参加第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，听了国务院李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。第一个五年计划是祖国社会主义建设的重要的一步。我决心为完成这个计划而献出我的全部力量。
    第一个五年计划已经实行两年多了。事实证明，发展工业确实给农业生产带来了不少的好处。比如，我们湖南醴陵县设立了六十七部抽水机的抽水机站，解决了数以千亩计的农田灌溉问题，使粮食普遍增产了。化学肥料、杀虫药械、新式农具等工业品也有力地支持了农民的生产。这些好处是每个农民都能体会到的。
    为了使农业生产能够适应整个国家经济计划的发展，我认为下面几件事情是应该注意的，我决心把它做好：
    一、加强对农民的宣传教育工作，提高农民的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞农民的生产积极性。我们的农业生产合作社有不少社员认为社搞得不错了，生产年年上升，就觉得目前一切已经差不多了。因此我们有必要把总路线和五年计划的精神向农民进行广泛深入的宣传教育，反复讲清社会主义的远大目标，号召大家努力提高生产，并且注意对互助组和单干户的团结，带动他们早日走上合作化的道路。
    二、要告诉农民，建设社会主义要经过我们大家的艰苦努力，决不能坐享现成。目前国家还不可能把大量的机器和化学肥料供给农业使用，因此我们除了把粮食、棉花卖给国家，支援工业建设外，还得靠自己多动脑筋，想办法开辟肥源、多种高产作物等等，来发展生产。
    三、在农村进行社会主义改造的时候，阶级敌人是一定要来进行破坏的。我们千万不能麻痹大意，要百倍地提高警惕，揭发和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，防止他们来破坏我们的生产和互助合作运动，保证祖国建设的顺利进行。
                全国人民代表大会代表　李呈桂
