Li Shunda and other model agricultural laborers attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, including Shen Jilan, Qu Yaoli, Wu Chun'an, Guo Yu'en, Li Shunzhang, and Rao Xingli, all expressed unanimous and enthusiastic praise for China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. They were very excited about the grand scale of construction outlined in the Five-Year Plan and expressed their determination to vigorously develop agricultural production to meet the needs of industrial construction. Li Shunda said: "The Five-Year Plan stipulates that priority should be given to the development of heavy industry, which is completely correct. Only in this way can we build our solid national defense and supply agriculture with a large number of agricultural machines to transform backward agriculture into advanced agriculture. Our farmers must produce according to the national plan, supply grain to industrial construction, and supply raw materials." Qu Yaoli and Guo Yu'en both said: The Five-Year Plan is very comprehensive and takes all aspects into consideration. No matter which aspect, it is all for the development of socialism and for the benefit of the people. The way for farmers to realize the Five-Year Plan is to produce more grain and cotton. Wu Chun'an continued: "If industry develops but agriculture cannot keep up, it will become a big problem. Like last year, industry increased production, but our cooperative's cotton production decreased compared to the previous year. How can this support industrial construction? This time, we must go back and promote increased production to the farmers, and socialism will come sooner." Shen Jilan said: "The Five-Year Plan is a national plan, and in the future, individual small production plans must be subordinate to this big plan. The state needs to plant what, and we will plant what."

Li Shunzhang said when talking about his feelings: "The people of Shandong have been threatened by the Yellow River for generations. The Five-Year Plan proposes to start the fundamental treatment project of the Yellow River, turning water hazards into water conservancy, which is a great joy for the people of Shandong and even the whole country. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that many power stations and factories should be built, and many mines should be mined. We must strive to increase grain and industrial raw materials to meet the needs of national industrialization."

Rao Xingli, with a beaming face, compared the policy of developing heavy industry first to "If you want to eat eggs, you must first raise hens." He said that their cooperative used chemical fertilizers such as calcium sulfate and superphosphate, as well as insecticidal powder, last year, and the result was a significant increase in output. "It can be imagined that with the continuous establishment and development of heavy industry, and with the realization of the first Five-Year Plan, the benefits to agriculture will become greater and greater. After we go back, we must work hard to find tricks and produce more grain to better support industrial construction."

    李顺达等决心多生产粮食支援工业建设
    本报讯　出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的代表农业劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰、曲耀离、吴春安、郭玉恩、李顺章、饶兴礼等，对于我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划都一致热烈赞扬。他们对五年计划所提示的建设规模的宏大都非常兴奋，同时表示要努力发展农业生产以适应工业建设的需要。李顺达说：“五年计划规定要优先发展重工业，这完全正确。只有这样，才能建设起我们巩固的国防，才能给农业生产供给大批农业机器，把落后的农业改变为先进的农业。我们农民一定要按照国家计划生产，给工业建设供给粮食，供给原料。”曲耀离和郭玉恩都说：五年计划订得很全面，各方面都照顾到了，不论那一方面都是为了发展社会主义，都是给人民谋利益。农民们实现五年计划的办法就是多生产粮食和棉花。吴春安接着说：“工业发展了，农业跟不上，就成了大问题。像去年，工业都增产，我们社的棉花却比前年减了产，这怎么能支援工业建设？这回回去一定要向农民宣传，多多增产，社会主义就来得快一点。”申纪兰说：“五年计划是国家的大计划，以后个人生产的小计划就要服从这个大计划，国家需要种什么，自己就种什么。”
    李顺章在谈到他的感想时说：“我们山东人民世世代代都遭受到黄河的威胁，五年计划中提出要开始进行黄河治本工程，把水害变成水利，这对山东以至全国人民来说都是一件大喜事。五年计划中规定要建立很多发电站和工厂，要开采很多矿山，我们一定要努力增产粮食和工业原料，满足国家工业化的需要。”
    红光满面的饶兴礼把先发展重工业的方针比作“要想吃鸡蛋，先得养母鸡”。他说，他们的合作社去年使用了硫酸钙、过磷酸钾等化学肥料以及除虫药粉，结果产量就增加很大。“可以设想，随着重工业的不断建立和发展，随着第一个五年计划的实现，带给农业的好处将越来越大。我们回去以后一定要努力找窍门，多生产粮食，更好地支援工业建设。”
