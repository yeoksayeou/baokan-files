Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: This year, the mechanical irrigation and drainage in China's agriculture has made new progress in the first half of the year. According to statistics from fifteen provinces and one municipality alone, approximately 1,200 sets of agricultural water pumps with a total of 27,000 horsepower were added in the first half of this year, and it is planned to benefit approximately 1.5 million mu of farmland.

　　Most of these water pumps are in the rice-growing areas of the South. In addition to adding more than 3,700 horsepower of small water pumps this year, Jiangsu Province also newly built a large-scale water pump irrigation station in Huangli, Wujin, and a water pump drainage station in Jinjia Dawei, Changshu. These two locations have a total of 21 sets of water pumps, with 1,560 horsepower, benefiting 75,000 mu of farmland. This year, Anhui Province used 459 sets of water pumps with approximately 8,500 horsepower, which were temporarily used for flood prevention and drainage last year, to establish 30 water pump stations in six special districts, which can protect more than 370,000 mu of farmland from drought and flood disasters. Many dry lands in the beneficiary area will be converted into paddy fields, and single-season rice will be converted into double-season rice. In addition to building eight new mechanical drainage projects in the ninth district of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province also built a larger-scale Xiataihewei mechanical drainage station in Gaoming County. Its equipment capacity can discharge 32,400 tons of flooded water in one hour, freeing more than 35,000 mu of farmland in six townships in the fourth district of Gaoming County from the threat of perennial waterlogging, and increasing grain production by more than 7 million jin for the country every year. This year, three new artificial rainfall stations were built in the suburbs of Shanghai to irrigate vegetable fields. Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai provinces in the Northwest region have also started pilot water pump stations this year, starting to pump water to irrigate the high terraces along the Yellow River and wheat and cotton on the plateau, turning dry land into irrigated land. This year, many small water pumps run by the masses themselves have been added in the Northeast region, and nearly 100,000 mu of dry land have been converted into paddy fields in Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces as a result.

　　Most of the water pumps used in various places this year are manufactured by our own factories. After using water pumps, the farmers all expressed that they would step up production to support the country's industrial construction.

### 全国农业机械灌溉排水事业有新发展

    全国农业机械灌溉排水事业有新发展
    据新华社二十六日讯　今年上半年我国农业上的机械灌溉排水事业有了新的发展。仅据十五个省、一个市的统计，今年上半年增加了约一千二百多套共有二万七千匹马力的农用抽水机，计划受益农田达一百五十万亩左右。
   这些抽水机大部分在南方的水稻地区。江苏省今年除增加了三千七百多匹马力的小型抽水机外，另在武进湟里新建了一个规模较大的抽水机灌溉站，在常熟金家大圩新建了一个抽水机排水站。这两处共有抽水机二十一套，一千五百六十匹马力，受益农田面积达七万五千亩。安徽省今年用去年临时用来防汛排涝的四百五十九套约八千五百匹马力的抽水机，在六个专区内建立了三十个抽水机站，可使三十七万多亩农田免除旱涝灾害的威胁，受益区内很多旱地将改为水田，单季稻改为双季稻。广东省除在新会县第九区新建了八个机械排水工程外，还在高明县新建一个规模较大的下泰和围机械排水站，它的设备能力可以在一小时内排出三万二千四百吨的渍水，使高明县第四区六个乡的三万五千多亩农田永远解除了历年内涝的威胁，每年可为国家增产七百多万斤粮食。上海市郊今年新建了三座人工降雨站，灌溉蔬菜田。西北地区的甘肃、陕西、青海三省今年也都试办了抽水机站，开始抽水灌溉黄河边上的高台地和高原上的小麦、棉花，变旱田为水浇地。东北地区今年增加了很多群众自办的小型抽水机，辽宁、黑龙江两省因此有近十万亩旱地改成了水田。
    今年各地所用的抽水机绝大部分是我国工厂自己制造的。农民们使用抽水机以后，都表示要加紧生产，支援国家工业建设。
