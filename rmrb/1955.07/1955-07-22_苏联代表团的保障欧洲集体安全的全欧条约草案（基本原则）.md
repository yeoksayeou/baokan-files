    Draft of the All-European Treaty on Ensuring Collective Security in Europe (Basic Principles) by the Soviet Delegation
    In order to guarantee peace and security in Europe and prevent aggression against any European country,
    In order to strengthen international cooperation based on the principles of respecting the independence and sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in their internal affairs,
    In order to make all European countries work together to guarantee collective security in Europe, instead of organizing groups of some European countries against other European countries, thereby causing international friction and tension and increasing mutual distrust,
    Considering that the establishment of a European collective security system will help to resolve the German issue as soon as possible through the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis,
    The European states, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, conclude an All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe, the basic provisions of which are as follows:
    (1) All European countries—regardless of their social system—and the United States of America can participate in this treaty, as long as they recognize the purposes stated in the treaty and undertake the obligations stipulated in the treaty.
    Before the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can participate in this treaty and enjoy equal rights with other contracting parties. Of course, after the unification of Germany, a unified Germany can participate in this treaty on an equal footing with any other European country.
    The conclusion of the European Collective Security Treaty shall not affect the powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to deal with the German issue, and the German issue shall be resolved in accordance with the decisions previously made by the four countries.
    (2) The contracting parties guarantee not to engage in aggression against each other, nor to use threats or force in their international relations, and guarantee to resolve any disputes that may arise between them by peaceful means and in a manner that does not endanger international peace and security in Europe, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
    (3) Whenever any contracting party believes that one or more contracting parties are in danger of armed attack in Europe, they shall consult with each other in order to take effective steps to eliminate such danger and maintain European security.
    (4) Any armed attack in Europe by one country or some countries against any one or more contracting parties shall be regarded as an attack against all contracting parties. In the event of such an attack, each contracting party shall exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense, and use all means at its disposal, including the use of force, to assist one or more countries that have been subjected to such an attack, in order to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe.
    (5) The contracting parties guarantee to jointly discuss and determine as soon as possible the methods by which the contracting parties provide assistance—including military assistance—when a situation arises in Europe that requires collective efforts to restore and maintain peace in Europe.
    (6) The contracting parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, immediately notify the United Nations Security Council of any action already taken or intended to be taken for the purpose of exercising the right of self-defense or maintaining peace and security in Europe.
    (7) The contracting parties guarantee not to participate in any alliance or union whose purposes are contrary to the purposes of the European Collective Security Treaty, nor to conclude any such agreement.
    (8) The contracting parties guarantee to promote broad economic and cultural cooperation between themselves and between themselves and other countries, by developing trade and other economic relations and expanding cultural ties on the basis of eliminating any discrimination and restrictions that hinder such cooperation.
    (9) In order to implement the provisions of the treaty regarding consultations between the contracting parties and to consider issues arising from the task of ensuring European security, the following provisions shall be made:
    (A) Hold regular meetings, or special meetings when necessary, with each country appointing a government official or some other special representative to attend the meetings.
    (B) Establish a Standing Political Consultative Committee, whose task is to prepare appropriate recommendations to be submitted to the governments of the contracting parties.
    (C) Establish a military consultation body, the scope of its authority to be specified at an appropriate time.
    (10) Recognizing that the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, the contracting parties shall invite the Government of the People's Republic of China to appoint representatives to participate as observers in the various institutions established in accordance with the treaty.
    (11) This treaty shall not in any way prejudice the obligations undertaken by European countries under the international treaties and agreements to which they are parties, provided that the principles and purposes of such agreements are consistent with this treaty.
    (12) The contracting parties agree that, during the first stage (two to three years) of implementing the measures stipulated in this treaty for establishing a European collective security system, they shall not be relieved of their obligations under existing treaties and agreements.
    At the same time, countries participating in existing treaties and agreements with military obligations shall not use force and shall resolve all disputes that may arise between them by peaceful means. In the event of any differences or disputes between them that may constitute a threat to the maintenance of peace in Europe, the contracting parties to the relevant treaties and agreements shall also consult with each other.
    (13) Pending the conclusion of agreements on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of European countries, the contracting parties guarantee not to take any further steps to increase their armed forces in the territories of other European countries in accordance with treaties and agreements previously concluded by them.
    (14) The contracting parties agree that, upon the expiration of a mutually agreed time limit from the date of entry into force of this treaty, the Warsaw Treaty of May 14, 1955, the Paris Agreements of October 23, 1954, and the North Atlantic Treaty of April 4, 1949, shall all expire.
    (15) The term of validity of this treaty shall be fifty years.

    苏联代表团的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案（基本原则）
    为了保障欧洲和平和安全并且防止对欧洲任何国家的侵略，
    为了按照尊重各国的独立和主权和不干涉各国内政的原则来加强国际合作，
    为了使所有欧洲国家一致努力来保障欧洲的集体安全，而不是组织某些欧洲国家反对其他一些欧洲国家的集团，从而引起国际磨擦和紧张关系并且加重互不信任，
    鉴于建立欧洲集体安全体系会有助于通过在和平和民主基础上统一德国的途径早日解决德国问题，
    欧洲国家本着联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，缔结一项保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，条约的基本条款如下：
    （一）所有欧洲国家——不管它们的社会制度如何——以及美利坚合众国都可以参加这个条约，只要它们承认条约中陈述的宗旨，并且承担条约中规定的义务。
    在一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的德国成立以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以参加这个条约，享受同其他缔约国平等的权利。当然，在德国统一以后，统一的德国可以在同其他任何欧洲国家处于平等地位的情况下参加这个条约。
    欧洲集体安全条约的缔结不应当影响苏、美、英、法四国处理德国问题的权限，德国问题应当按照四国从前作出的决定加以解决。
    （二）缔约国保证互不进行侵略，也不在它们的国际关系中使用威胁或者武力，并且保证遵照联合国宪章，用和平方法和不危及欧洲的国际和平和安全的方式，解决它们中间可能发生的任何争端。
    （三）凡任何缔约国认为一个或者一个以上的缔约国在欧洲有遭受武装进攻的危险时，它们应彼此进行协商，以便采取有效步骤来消除这种危险和维持欧洲安全。
    （四）任何一国或者一些国家在欧洲对任何一个或一个以上的缔约国发动的武装进攻，应被认为是对所有缔约国的进攻。一旦遇有这样的进攻发生时，每一缔约国应行使单独自卫或者集体自卫的权利，以它所拥有的一切手段，包括使用武力在内，来援助受到这种进攻的一个或者一个以上的国家，以便恢复和维持欧洲的国际和平和安全。
    （五）缔约国保证尽速共同讨论并确定在欧洲出现需要作集体努力来恢复并维持欧洲和平的局势时缔约国提供援助——包括军事援助在内——的办法。
    （六）缔约国应根据联合国宪章的规定，把为了行使自卫权利或者维持欧洲和平和安全而已经采取或者打算采取的任何行动，立即通知联合国安全理事会。
    （七）缔约国保证不参加其宗旨与欧洲集体安全条约的宗旨相抵触的任何同盟或联盟，也不缔结任何这样的协定。
    （八）缔约国保证促进它们之间以及它们和其他国家之间广泛的经济和文化合作，办法是在排除任何妨碍这种合作的歧视和限制的基础上，发展贸易和其他经济关系，扩大文化联系。
    （九）为了执行条约中关于缔约国间进行协商的规定并且考虑由于保障欧洲安全的任务而产生的问题，应当作下列规定：
    （甲）举行定期会议，或者在必要时举行特别会议，每一国家指派一个政府官员或者某一其他特派代表参加会议。
    （乙）设立一个常设政治协商委员会，它的任务是准备向缔约国政府提出的适当的建议。
    （丙）设立一个军事协商机构，它的职权范围到适当时间加以具体规定。
    （十）认识到联合国安全理事会常任理事国对维持国际和平和安全负有特别责任，缔约国应邀请中华人民共和国政府指派代表以观察员身份参加依照条约成立的各种机构。
    （十一）本条约不应丝毫损害欧洲国家根据它们参加的国际条约和协定所承担的义务，只要这种协定的原则和宗旨同本条约一致。
    （十二）缔约国同意，在执行本条约规定的建立欧洲集体安全体系的措施的第一阶段（两年到三年），它们不应解除它们根据现有条约和协定承担的义务。
    同时，参加有军事义务规定的现有条约和协定的国家，不得使用武力，并且应当用和平方法解决它们之间可能发生的一切争端。在它们之间发生可能构成对维持欧洲和平的威胁的任何分歧或争端时，有关条约和协定的缔约国也应互相协商。
    （十三）在关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及关于从欧洲国家的领土上撤退外国军队的协议缔结以前，缔约国保证不采取任何进一步的步骤来根据它们先前缔结的条约和协定增加它们在其他欧洲国家领土上的武装部队。
    （十四）缔约国同意，在一致商定的从本条约生效之时起的某一时限期满时，一九五五年五月十四日的华沙条约，一九五四年十月二十三日的巴黎协定和一九四九年四月四日的北大西洋公约都应失效。
    （十五）本条约的有效期限为五十年。
