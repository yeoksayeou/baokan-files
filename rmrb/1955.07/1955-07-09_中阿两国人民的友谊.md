　　The Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian People
　　By Fikeili Wo Ge Li, Editor-in-chief of Albanian "People's Voice"
　　In April 1939, the fascist Italian army forcibly landed at the port of Durrës in order to occupy the small territory of Albania, and encountered armed resistance from the Albanian people.
　　Now, sixteen years later, in this same port of Durrës, Albanian workers are unloading goods and gifts from a brotherly country across the ocean. The gifts from the great Chinese people to the Albanian people on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation arrived in our country this spring. This is a new manifestation of the close cooperation between the invincible camp of peace and socialism.
　　In the initial days after liberation, that is, ten years ago, many ships began to arrive in our ports, bringing tractors to cultivate our liberated fertile land, equipment for our newly built factories, and the first locomotives and carriages for the railway, as well as automobiles, various consumer goods, etc. All of these marked friendship, marked the love of the Soviet Union and the people of the fraternal people's democratic countries for our people.
　　As everyone knows, for the past thousand years, the Albanian people have been subjected to barbarous aggression, enslavement, and slaughter, and have been the object of slaughter and territorial plunder by other countries. But they have never yielded in the face of the enemy. The Albanian people took up arms, sometimes together with other nations, sometimes single-handedly, and overcame many historical disasters, defended their glory and freedom, and won victory. But now they are no longer alone, they are the masters of their own destiny, they are part of the great camp of peace and democracy. In our country, whether you talk to workers, peasants, or intellectuals, they are very accustomed to saying: "Now we are not one million, we are nine hundred million."
　　Our heroic Party, following the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, has made our people participate in the great family of nations, and has united our people with the free nations of the new world with close and unbreakable friendship. The working people of this new world are successfully building a better and more prosperous life.
　　Not long ago, the Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl" was staged in a theater in Tirana. The audience saw not only the great epic of the Chinese people's struggle and their glorious victory, but also many features similar to the past life of our people under the barbaric oppression of feudal lords and the bourgeoisie. A close bond of friendship has now been established between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people. Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, wrote in his reply to the Chinese government delegation that came to our country to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation: "The friendship between our two peoples is invincible, because our friendship is based on friendship with our common friend, the Soviet Union, the glorious banner of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism."
　　Relying on the help of our friends headed by the Soviet Union, relying on the patriotism and revolutionary upsurge of the Albanian people, and relying on the correct leadership of our Party, our country, which was once backward and uncultured, has made many significant achievements in the struggle to build the foundations of socialism. This year, our people are waging a tenacious struggle to strive to overfulfill the plan for the final year of the first five-year plan. The achievements made in 1954 are a reliable guarantee for the completion of the five-year plan. Compared with 1953, the total value of industrial products in 1954 increased to 110.7 percent. Significant achievements have also been made in agriculture. Agricultural cooperatives have been established, and they have obtained high yields of crops and other crops. New machine tractor stations have been established and existing machine tractor stations have been expanded. The tractors, which increase year by year, have greatly promoted the completion of agricultural production tasks. Great achievements have also been made in art and culture.
　　In the final year of the Five-Year Plan, namely 1955, the total output of industrial products in our country will increase by 10 percent. In agriculture, wheat production will increase by 25 percent, and cotton production will increase by 87 percent. The completion of the 1955 plan will create conditions for the implementation of the second five-year plan.
　　Our people have diligently begun their creative and constructive labor. They believe in their bright future, because now the Albanian people not only have the correct leadership of the Party, but also have the full support of close friends. Although our country is not geographically adjacent to the camp of peace and socialism, it is inextricably linked to the camp of peace and socialism. The hysterical cries and barks of the American and British imperialists and their accomplices, who do not want our country to develop and prosper, cannot frighten the Albanian people. As everyone knows, the imperialist aggressors, headed by the reactionary American group, have done everything they can to sabotage our country during the National Liberation War, especially in the ten years since liberation, in order to cause losses to our people. They used pressure, blackmail, and sending spies and saboteurs to sneak into our country, organizing large-scale provocative activities, and so on. But the conspiracies and tricks of the American and British imperialists aimed at opposing the People's Republic of Albania have been shamefully defeated. A wise proverb in our country says it well:
　　"Although dogs are barking, the camel caravan moves on." We are moving forward along the road of laying the foundations of socialism, vigilantly defending our peaceful labor, peace, and socialism.
　　Our people have never been so strong and confident as they are now. Albania will never be as lonely as it was in 1939. Its internal and international situation is now very favorable, because it is a member of the socialist camp of the great nine hundred million people. The Albanian people will always be faithful to the camp of peace and socialism, in which the People's Republic of China enjoys great prestige.
　　The friendship between the Albanian and Chinese people has existed for a long time. The Albanian people have watched the long struggle of the Chinese people with great sympathy and concern. The Albanian people celebrated the victory of the Chinese people's revolution with enthusiasm, and they regarded the victory of the Chinese revolution as the most important international event after the Great October Socialist Revolution. This victory opened up the road for the people of China to build socialism; the Albanian people congratulated the victory of the Chinese people as a brilliant victory for the camp of peace and democracy.
　　Our people are pleased with the victories won by the Chinese people in the struggle to build a new life. The Chinese people's construction of huge water conservancy projects, industrial and mining enterprises, railway lines, etc., has been warmly praised by our people. Because the great victories won by the Chinese people in the struggle for peace and socialism, like all the victories of the camp of peace and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, are also the victory of our people and the victory of our entire camp. The Albanian people are deeply concerned about and support the struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people fighting side by side against American imperialism. The Albanian people are very indignant at the American imperialists' occupation of Taiwan. We are very clear about what it means for Taiwan to be in the hands of enemies who are trying to incite war. Because of the Italian imperialists' occupation of Sazani Island in Albania in 1920, the Albanian people were also in a similar situation at that time, although the scale was smaller and the historical conditions were different. Later, this island became a springboard for attacking the Balkans. A member of an agricultural production cooperative in the village of Rembez, Korçë, once replied to a propagandist who reported to them on the international situation: "Just as Sazani Island finally returned to the embrace of its motherland Albania, Taiwan should and will belong to the People's Republic of China. The people of all countries who love freedom and peace demand this, and it is the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China."
　　After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the relations and friendship between our two countries have begun to develop and consolidate continuously. Diplomatic relations were established for the first time in the history of the two countries. Four different agreements have been signed between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania: a barter and payment agreement; a cultural cooperation agreement; a technical and technical-scientific cooperation agreement; and an agreement on Chinese loans to Albania. Like the gifts given by the Chinese people to the Albanian people on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation, and the mutual exchange of government delegations, all these vividly demonstrate the consolidation and development of the friendly relations and cooperation between our two peoples.
　　The reason why friendly, close, and sincere relations can be established between a country with a small population like ours and a country with a population of 600 million is because of the existence of our common friend, the glorious Soviet Union, and because the people of our two countries are standing on the forefront of the struggle to defend peace and build socialism, and to guarantee international security. This is the foundation on which the friendship between our two peoples is increasingly consolidated and developed. We believe that victory must belong to us. New things are growing, and they will surely defeat the old and declining things. Because in this great struggle, the camp of peace and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, is united by the feeling of close friendship, by the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and by unbreakable friendship.

　　中阿两国人民的友谊
　　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”主编　菲克里·沃格利
    一九三九年四月，法西斯意大利的军队为了占领领土狭小的阿尔巴尼亚，在都拉斯港强行登陆，遇到了阿尔巴尼亚人民的武装抵抗。
    而现在，十六年以后的今天，就在这同一个都拉斯港，阿尔巴尼亚的工人们在卸运来自远隔重洋的兄弟国家的货物和礼物。伟大中国人民在阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年之际赠送给阿尔巴尼亚人民的礼物在今年春天运到了我国。这是不可战胜的和平和社会主义阵营国家之间亲密合作的新的表现。
    在解放以后的最初日子里，即十年以前，许多轮船都开始来到我们的港口，运来了耕耘我们解放了的肥沃土地的拖拉机、供我们新建工厂用的装备和第一批铁路用的机车和车厢，以及汽车、各种消费品等，所有这些都标志着友谊，标志着苏联和各兄弟人民民主国家的人民对我国人民的热爱。
    大家都知道，阿尔巴尼亚人民在最近一千年以来，都是野蛮的侵略、奴役和屠杀的对象，是其他国家屠杀和掠夺领土的对象。但是他们在敌人的面前，从来也没有屈服过。阿尔巴尼亚人民拿起武器，有时同其他民族一起，有时单枪匹马地战胜了许多次历史上的灾难，他们保卫了自己的光荣和自由，并且赢得了胜利。但是，现在他们不再是孤独的了，他们是自己命运的支配者，他们是伟大的和平民主阵营的一部分。在我国，无论同工人、农民和知识分子谈话，他们会很习惯地说：“现在我们已不是一百万，我们是九亿了。”
    我们英勇的党，遵循着马克思列宁主义的学说，使我国人民参加了各民族的大家庭，用亲密的和牢不可破的友谊把我国人民同新世界的自由的各民族联合起来了，这个新世界的劳动人民在顺利地建设更美好和更富裕的生活。
    不久前，在地拉那的剧院里上演了中国歌剧“白毛女”，观众们在这个歌剧里不仅看到了中国人民斗争的伟大史诗和他们的光荣胜利，而且也看到了同过去我国人民在封建主和资产阶级的野蛮压迫下的生活相类似的许多特征。在阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间，现在已经建立起亲密的友谊联系。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，在他给为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年来我国的中国政府代表团的回信中写道：“我们两国人民之间的友谊是不可战胜的，因为我们的友谊是建立在同我们共同的朋友，和平、民主和社会主义阵营的光荣旗手苏联的友谊的基础之上的。”
    依靠着以苏联为首的我们朋友的帮助，依靠着阿尔巴尼亚人民的爱国主义和革命的高涨，依靠着我党的正确的领导，我们这个过去落后的和没有文化的国家，在争取建设社会主义基础的斗争中已获得了许多重大成就。今年，我国人民为争取超额完成第一个五年计划的最后一年计划而展开顽强的斗争。一九五四年所获得的成就是完成五年计划可靠的保证。同一九五三年相比，一九五四年的工业产品总额增加到百分之一百一十点七。在农业方面，也获得了显著的成就。农业合作社已建立起来，它们获得农作物和其他作物的高额收获。建立了新的机器拖拉机站并扩大了现有的机器拖拉机站，逐年增加的拖拉机大大地促进了农业生产任务的完成。在艺术和文化方面也获得了巨大的成就。
    在五年计划的最后一年，即一九五五年，我国的工业品总产量将增加百分之十。农业方面，小麦的产量将增加百分之二十五，棉花的生产量增加百分之八十七。一九五五年计划的完成，将为实施第二个五年计划创造条件。
    我国人民勤勉地开始了他们的创造性和建设性的劳动，他们相信自己美好的未来，因为现在阿尔巴尼亚人民不仅有党的正确的领导，而且有挚友的充分支持。尽管在地理上我国同和平和社会主义阵营不相接壤，但是它是同和平和社会主义阵营不可分割地联系着的。不愿我国发展和繁荣的美英帝国主义分子及其助手的歇斯底里的叫嚣和狂吠，是吓不住阿尔巴尼亚人民的。大家都知道，以美国反动集团为首的帝国主义侵略分子，在民族解放战争时期，特别是在解放后这十年以来，曾尽其所能地对我国进行破坏，以使我国人民遭到损失。他们使用了压力、讹诈和派遣间谍和破坏分子潜入我国，进行组织大规模的挑衅活动等等。但是美英帝国主义者旨在反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的阴谋诡计都遭到了可耻的失败。我国一句智慧的谚语说得好：
  “尽管狗在狂吠，骆驼队照样前进。”我们沿着奠定社会主义的基础的道路前进，警惕地保卫着我们的和平劳动、和平和社会主义。
    我国人民从来都没有像现在这样强大和自信。阿尔巴尼亚再也不会像在一九三九年那样孤独了。它的内部情况和国际情况现在是非常有利的，因为它是伟大的九亿人的社会主义阵营的一员。阿尔巴尼亚人民将自始至终地忠实于和平和社会主义阵营，在这个阵营中，中华人民共和国是享有很大威望的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊早就存在了。阿尔巴尼亚人民曾非常同情地和关切地注视着中国人民的长期斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民曾满怀热忱地庆祝中国人民革命的胜利，他们认为中国革命的胜利是伟大十月社会主义革命以后最重大的国际事件。这个胜利为人民中国开辟了建设社会主义的道路；阿尔巴尼亚人民把中国人民的胜利当作和平和民主阵营的辉煌胜利来祝贺。
    我国人民因为中国人民在争取建设新生活的斗争中所获得的胜利而感到愉快。中国人民修建巨大的水利工程、工矿企业、铁路干线等等，得到我国人民的热烈赞扬。因为中国人民在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中所获得的伟大胜利，就像以苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营的一切胜利一样，也是我们人民的胜利，也是我们整个阵营的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民并肩携手地反对美帝国主义的斗争寄予深切的关怀和支持。美国帝国主义分子强占台湾使阿尔巴尼亚人民非常愤恨。我们十分清楚，台湾掌握在企图煽动战争的敌人的手里是意味着什么。由于一九二○年意大利帝国主义分子占领阿尔巴尼亚的萨斯诺岛，当时阿尔巴尼亚人民也处于一种相似的情况，虽然其规模较小而且历史条件不同，后来，这个岛成为进攻巴尔干的跳板。科尔察州列姆别兹村的一位农业生产合作社社员曾这样回答一位对他们报告国际局势的宣传员说：“像萨斯诺岛终于回到它的祖国阿尔巴尼亚的怀抱一样，台湾也应当而且一定会归属于中华人民共和国的。爱自由和爱和平的各国人民要求这样，这是中华人民共和国合法的权利。”
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国之间的关系和友谊已开始不断地发展和巩固。在两国历史上首次建立起外交关系。在中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国之间已缔结了四个不同的协定：换货和付款协定；文化合作协定；技术和技术科学合作协定以及中国对阿尔巴尼亚贷款的协定。如中国人民在我国解放十周年之际给与阿尔巴尼亚人民的赠礼，互派政府代表团，所有这些都鲜明地证明我们两国人民之间友谊关系和合作的巩固和发展。
    像我们这样一个人口少的国家和一个六亿人口的国家之间所以能建立起友谊的、亲切的和真挚的关系，这是因为我们共同的朋友——光荣的苏联的存在，这是因为我们两国人民都是站在争取保卫和平和建设社会主义，以及争取保障国际安全的斗争的前沿阵地。这就是日益巩固和发展我们两国人民之间的友谊所依靠的基础。我们相信，胜利一定是属于我们的。新生的东西在成长着，它必将战胜旧的和衰退的东西。因为在这个伟大的斗争中，以苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营，是以亲密的友谊的感情，是以马克思列宁主义的原则，以牢不可破的友谊团结起来的。
