    Resolutely Oppose All Forms of Waste

    Steel blocks are thrown away in the slag pit every day.
    To the Editor:
    For the past two years, workers at the Chongqing 101 Factory's iron smelting workshop have been picking up many discarded steel blocks from the factory's slag pit every day. Some of these blocks weigh dozens of kilograms, and some even weigh over two hundred kilograms.

    The amount of waste produced by the steelmaking workshop last year due to various reasons was shocking. Based solely on a calculation comparing the amount of raw materials entering the workshop with the expected output of steel, the total loss for the year was approximately 900 tons of steel. The cost overrun alone, if used to buy rice, would be enough to feed all the workers in the workshop for seventeen years.

    The workers' proactive efforts to retrieve steel blocks from the slag pit are an act of cherishing state property, and the factory leaders often commend them. However, what's strange is that they only commend the workers who pick up the steel blocks, but they haven't taken any measures to stop the phenomenon of discarding steel blocks. It is said that they don't think such things are worth getting "alarmed" about and that "it's nothing new." The company manager even said, "Having been in the workshop for a long time, we are used to seeing it, and we turn a blind eye to it." This "it's a big enterprise, so it doesn't matter" mentality is unacceptable. The country is currently engaged in socialist construction, and the need for steel is very urgent. Is losing thousands of tons of steel a small matter?

    A prospecting team that squanders money pursuing comfort
    To the Editor:
    The First Prospecting Team of the North China Coalfield has serious problems with waste and stockpiling.

    According to instructions from higher authorities, the offices of the prospecting departments should be mobile yurts so that they can be moved after the prospecting work is completed. However, Wang Changlin, the captain of this prospecting team, insisted on building three semi-permanent wooden houses, which cost several times more than yurts. At the same time, without the approval of higher authorities, he decided to build luxurious clinics, staff canteens, bathhouses, and barbershops. In the canteen, Jiangxi porcelain was used for tableware; the large round tables were covered with a layer of high-quality lacquered cloth, and then covered with a layer of bleached cloth. The barbershop spent nearly 600 yuan on three swivel chairs. In addition, the prospecting team spent more than 20,000 yuan to buy boilers and water pumps, preparing to install heating equipment. Although this was stopped by the team's Party branch, these valuable heating and plumbing equipment have been left outdoors for a long time, exposed to the wind and rain.

    This prospecting team also frequently and blindly allocated materials and purchased equipment. For example, they requested six 20-horsepower water pumps from higher authorities, which have not been used to this day; a large number of pipes have been transferred, and there are currently 60 tons of seamless steel pipes and 65 tons of one-inch and two-inch black iron pipes stockpiled; a large number of angle irons and wood have also been stockpiled for more than a year. A very small repair shop also spent more than 20,000 yuan to buy a universal milling machine, but it cannot be installed because the workshop is too small. What is even more intolerable is that some of these materials are thrown away whenever the drilling rig is moved. For example, after a certain drilling rig was moved, thirteen drill bits were discarded, and many steel pipes were picked up by local people to be used as roof beams; even a large crane was lost, and it was later found in the deep mountains. According to a recent investigation, several tons of materials are still missing.

    I suggest that the Ministry of Fuel Industry correct the wasteful behavior of this unit and rationally allocate the stockpiled materials. 　Dong Maoxia

    No one is responsible for managing equipment.
    To the Editor:
    The management of equipment in the Linxi Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine has been unattended for a long time, and waste is very serious. A large amount of equipment is piled up everywhere in this mine, and much of it has been damaged. In the wheel eyes of the 6653 dregs, there are many parts and chains of electric vehicles, most of which are immersed in water. 500 cable hooks were spent on the 6671 dregs, but they were all lost after only four or five disassemblies.

    The utilization rate of equipment in this mine is very poor. The mine has nearly a hundred pneumatic hammers in stock that are not used, and in 1954, it asked higher authorities for seventeen new ones. There are a total of 126 electric coal drills, but less than half of them are actually put into production and standby, and the rest are piled up in the electromechanical section, already damaged or missing parts. Two loading machines that were requested last year have not been used to this day. There are tens of thousands of meters of cables in the mine, occupying half of a large courtyard, but the mine is still short of cables to use.

    The mine's supply plan is also very chaotic. In December 1954, a water inrush accident occurred in this mine. Due to the suddenness of the incident, the General Administration of Kailuan Coal Mine allowed the use of materials first and then supplement the plan. But until February of this year, the materials had already been used, and the plan had not yet been reported. After the completion of the construction of temporary and permanent weirs, it was impossible to find out which materials were used and how much money was spent. Due to the urging of the General Administration, the mine barely put together a plan that was far from the actual situation. In the disaster recovery work of the water inrush accident, the mine first made a plan of 830,000 yuan. The mine leaders felt that the amount of money was too small and increased it to 1.17 million yuan. The General Administration saw that this plan was unrealistic and asked for a reduction, and finally formulated a plan of 510,000 yuan, which was not only completely sufficient, but also had some equipment still stockpiled in the warehouse.

    I believe that the emergence of this phenomenon is completely inconsistent with the requirements of the state to increase production and practice economy. The leaders of the Linxi Mine should quickly check and correct this wasteful phenomenon. 　Lao Song

    Unnecessary memorial pavilion
    To the Editor:
    In the municipal construction projects of Shenyang City last year, many comrades from the troops stationed in Shenyang and various organs, schools, and enterprises in Shenyang City participated in voluntary labor. The Shenyang Municipal Construction Bureau specially established a voluntary labor management committee; the government also allocated a sum of money as management fees and tool purchase fees for voluntary labor. Later, the Engineering Office of the Construction Bureau (now the Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau) allocated tools worth 20,000 yuan, so the tool fee of the voluntary labor management committee was more than enough, and as a result, 27,000 yuan was left over at the end of the year. In principle, this money should be turned over. However, in addition to spending 7,000 yuan on a clinic, the voluntary labor management committee of the Construction Bureau also planned to use the remaining 20,000 yuan to buy prizes. Later, a representative of a certain unit of the Shenyang garrison stated that they did not want prizes and asked to build a memorial pavilion. Therefore, the Construction Bureau decided to use this money to build two memorial pavilions.

    I believe that building a memorial pavilion is unnecessary. Since liberation, many great and arduous construction projects in the country, such as the Huai River control project and the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, have been built by the comrades of the troops. These projects themselves are the best memorials. The Shenyang Municipal Construction Bureau should cancel the plan to build the memorial pavilion and correctly handle this money in accordance with the financial system.

    Traveling thousands of miles to buy flowers for "greening"
    To the Editor:
    In order to green the environment of its unit, the Lanzhou Engineering General Company of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering actually sent someone to the Doukou Agricultural Experimental Farm in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province (more than 1,400 miles away from Lanzhou) and Wugong County, Shaanxi Province (more than 1,100 miles away from Lanzhou) to purchase famous flowers and exotic trees. The number of flowers and trees purchased was very large, with more than 2,400 flowers and more than 6,000 trees; if calculated on the basis of planting one flower or one tree per square meter, it would be enough to arrange a garden covering more than 8,000 square meters. There are many varieties of flowers and trees, including 29 kinds of flowers such as Four Seasons Plum, Iron Angle Begonia, Winter Jasmine, Holly, and Crape Myrtle, the most expensive of which is 3 yuan per plant, and some are even accompanied by high-quality flower pots of 4 yuan each; there are 22 kinds of trees such as apple, autumn pear, Dongshan peach, Xijing honey peach, flat peach, French parasol, and locust.

    In order to transport these flowers and trees back to Lanzhou from thousands of miles away, the company has been sending people to relevant stations since March of this year to ask for train carriages. The station refused this unreasonable transportation and made severe criticisms. However, the company was not reconciled, and they adopted the method of less-than-carload transportation to smuggle some of the flowers back one after another. Soon, the station found out and stopped this practice. As a result, most of the flowers and trees are still at the purchasing location. As for the small number of flowers that were smuggled back, some of them have already died.

    The company's large-scale greening project was decided by the company's leaders. What is even more serious is that the funds for the greening project were eliminated when the higher-level leading organs reviewed the company's basic construction plan, but the company's leaders did not hesitate to violate financial discipline and extracted more than 3,800 yuan from the funds of other engineering projects for "greening." However, when the problem was exposed, the company's leaders even thought that "this is a small matter and cannot be put on the work agenda." People find it strange, at a time when the people of the whole country are enthusiastically fighting for practicing economy and opposing waste, why do the leaders of this unit still take such a tolerant attitude towards their wasteful behavior? 　Chen Guang

    Measures that pick up sesame seeds and throw away watermelons
    To the Editor:
    On May 20th of this year, the Jilin Chemical Metallurgical Construction Company of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry issued a notice of more than 1,000 words on the "Provisional Measures for the Labor Wage System of Barbers," stipulating the wage standards, working hours, wage payment methods, and calculation formulas for barbers. This "provisional measure" took two months, went through discussions in various meetings, and was drafted; after drafting, it was approved by the Jilin City Labor Bureau. However, after this "provisional measure" was sent to the affiliated units, everyone was indifferent to it and thought it was useless.

    However, on the other hand, there are many loopholes in the current piece-rate wage method of the Jilin Provincial Chemical Metallurgical Construction Company, which have not been resolved for a long time. For example, in April and May, the task orders issued by the Second Company's Fourth Construction Site based on supplementary quotas accounted for more than one-fifth of those that were not timely; in April, the actual measurement of the earthwork project completed by the Second Construction Site of the First Company was only 9,589 cubic meters, but the task order was accepted according to 12,851 cubic meters, seriously wasting the state's wage fund. The labor organization is unreasonable, and the phenomenon of labor waste is also very serious. From January to April, the average daily waste of labor days in only the three affiliated companies was more than 1,600. The labor productivity is very low, and the plan is not completed every month. From January to April, the average completion rate of the labor productivity plan was only 64.5%.

    Why did the company leaders abandon these most important issues and not seriously study and improve them, but spend so much manpower and time to engage in such a "useless" "provisional measure"? Isn't this a measure of throwing away watermelons and picking up sesame seeds? 　Fang Xieji

    I hope to write the name and address clearly
    To the Editor:
    I am engaged in the registration of people's letters. The most difficult thing for me in my work is that the signature and address at the end of some letters are written very vaguely, and sometimes even after spending a lot of time, I can't tell what the words are. I think that the people who write letters all hope that people will help them solve their problems. If the name and address are not written clearly, the problem cannot be answered in time or cannot be answered at all. Therefore, I hope that people who write letters must write their name and address clearly. 　Liu Shuhe

    A batch of incomplete sets of new agricultural implements
    To the Editor:
    The Liyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Tenth District of Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, has a serious lack of responsibility in the operation of new agricultural implements. The agricultural implements in stock are lost here and there, and are scattered. The handle of the walking plow is broken, the large wheel of the weeder is lost at the mouth of the waterway, eight sections of the water wheel pipe were taken by the staff to make fire cylinders last winter, the sack is moldy and cannot be moved, and the screws of the small weeding hoe are so loose that the tip can be turned upwards.... When farmers buy a new agricultural implement, they have to look for a long time to put the parts together.

    At present, the Liyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative also has 60 sets of attachments such as pipe chains and winnowing baskets for the Liberation-style water wheel, which have been stockpiled in the courtyard for a long time. At first, they were covered with reed mats, but later, the wind and rain broke the reed mats, and they became the place for sparrows to nest. A rough calculation shows that these materials alone are worth 8,154 yuan. The car bodies of these water wheels are placed in the county cooperative, so that the water wheels cannot be complete sets; when the masses see these things, they often ask: "Do you lend out water wheels? Lend me one." The staff of the Liyang Cooperative have to answer: "These are incomplete sets of things!"

    The relevant parties should thoroughly check and correct the Liyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative's bad behavior of irresponsibility to the people's cause. 　Zhang Mingde

    坚决反对一切浪费现象
    渣坑里每天都有扔掉的钢块编辑同志：
    重庆一○一厂炼铁车间的工人，两年来每天都要从厂内渣坑里捡出很多扔掉的钢块，其中有几十公斤重一块的，甚至有二百多公斤重一块的。
    炼钢车间去年一年因各种原因所造成的废品是十分惊人的。仅据进料量同应出钢数来计算，全年损失约有九百多吨钢。成本超支一项，如果拿来买大米，足够全车间几百个工人吃十七年。
    工人主动从渣坑里捡出钢块是一种爱护国家财产的行为，厂的领导人也经常表扬他们。但奇怪的是他们只是表扬捡钢块的工人，却并没有采取什么办法来制止丢钢块的现象。据说，他们认为这样的事情不值得“大惊小怪”，“不是什么新鲜事”。公司经理还说：“在车间里呆久了，看惯了，也就熟视无睹了”。这种“大家业，不在乎”的思想是要不得的。目前国家正在进行社会主义建设，需要钢材是很迫切的。难道损失成千吨钢材还是小事吗？

    追求舒适乱花钱的勘探队编辑同志：
    华北煤田第一勘探大队的浪费行为和积压现象很严重。
    按照上级指示，勘探部门的办公室应该是活动式的蒙古包，以便勘探工作完毕后能够迁移。但是这个勘探大队的大队长王长林却私自主张修建了三幢半永久性的木板房，造价比蒙古包高出好几倍。同时他又未经上级同意，擅自决定修建了华丽的医务所、职工食堂、澡塘和理发室。食堂里，餐具用的是江西瓷器；大圆桌上铺了一层上等的漆布，上面再铺一层漂白布。理发室花了近六百元买来三个转椅。另外，这个勘探大队还花了二万多元买了锅炉、水泵，准备安装暖汽设备。这件事虽然被大队的党总支制止了，但是这些价值昂贵的水暖器材却长期放在露天里，任凭风吹雨淋。
    这个勘探大队还经常盲目调拨物资和购置器材。例如他们要求上级部门调来六台二十匹马力的水泵，至今没有利用；调来的大批管材，目前还积压着无缝钢管六十吨，一寸和两寸口径的黑铁管六十五吨；还有大批三角铁和木材也都积压了一年以上。规模很小的修配厂，也花了两万多元买来一台万能铣床，结果由于厂房过小而不能安装。更难令人容忍的是，这些器材每当钻机迁移就会被扔掉一些。像某号钻机迁走后扔掉了十三个钻头，许多钢管被当地老百姓拾回去作房梁；连体积很大的起重机也丢失了，后来才从深山里找了回来。据最近清查，还有好几吨物资找不到下落。
    我建议燃料工业部纠正这个单位的浪费行为，并且合理调配积压的物资。　董茂霞
    器材设备无人负责管理编辑同志：
    开滦煤矿林西矿井下的器材管理工作长期无人负责，浪费现象很严重。这个矿井到处都堆着大量器材，有不少已经损坏了。六六五三碴各轮子眼里，就有许多电溜子的部件和链子等，大部分都浸在水中。六六七一碴支出五百个电缆钩子，只拆了四、五次就丢完了。
    这个矿的设备利用情况很差。矿里积压着近百台风锤不用，一九五四年又向上级要了十七台新的。电煤钻共有一百二十六台，但真正投入生产和备用的不到半数，其余的堆在机电科里，已经搞得坏的坏，缺件的缺件。去年要来的两台装车机，到现在也没有用上。矿里有电缆约几万公尺，占了半个大院子，但是井下还缺少电缆用。
    矿里的供应器材的计划也十分混乱。一九五四年十二月，这个矿井下发生透水事故。由于事出突然，开滦煤矿总管理处为了照顾生产，允许先用器材后补计划。但是直到今年二月，器材早用了，计划还没上报。其中修建临时水闸和永久水闸的工程完工后，竟查不出到底用了哪些器材，花了多少钱。由于总管理处的催促，矿里才勉强凑出一个和实际情况相差甚远的计划来。在透水事故的灾害复旧工作中，矿里先作了八十三万元的计划。矿的领导人员认为要的钱太少，增加为一百一十七万元。总管理处看到这个计划不切实际，要求削减，最后制定出一个五十一万元的计划，不但完全够用，而且还有一些器材到现在还积压在库里。
    我认为，这种现象的出现是同国家增产节约的要求完全不相符的。林西矿领导方面应该迅速检查并纠正这种浪费现象。　老宋
    毫无必要的纪念亭编辑同志：
    在去年沈阳市的市政建设工程中，驻沈阳市的部队和沈阳市各机关、学校、企业的很多同志都参加了义务劳动。沈阳市建设局特设立了义务劳动管理委员会；政府还拨了一笔款，作为义务劳动的管理费和工具购置费。后来建设局工程处（现在的建设局工程公司）又拨来了价值二万元的工具，这样义务劳动管理委员会的工具费就多下来了，因而到年终结算时，结余了二万七千元。照理，这笔钱应该上缴。但是，建设局义务劳动管理委员会除了用掉七千元搞一个医务所外，还计划把剩下的两万元买奖品。后来沈阳驻军某部代表表示不要奖品，要求修一个纪念亭。因此，建设局就决定把这笔钱用来修两个纪念亭。
    我认为，修建纪念亭是没有必要的。解放以后国家很多伟大、艰巨的建设工程，如治淮工程、康藏、青藏公路等都是部队同志参加修建的。这些工程的本身，就是最好的纪念。沈阳市建设局应该取消修建纪念亭的计划，按照财政制度正确地处理这笔钱。	沈阳市财政局基建财务科　薛湛曾
    千里买花搞“绿化”编辑同志：
    建筑工程部西北工程管理总局兰州工程总公司为了绿化本单位的环境，竟派专人到陕西省三原县斗口农业试验场（距离兰州一千四百多华里）和陕西省武功县（距离兰州一千一百多华里）去采购名花异木。采购花木的数量很大，花共二千四百多株，树共六千多棵；如按每平方公尺栽一株花或一棵树计算，足够布置一个占地八千余平方公尺的花园。花木的品种繁多，花有四季梅、铁角海棠、迎春花、冬青、紫薇等二十九种，最贵的每株三元钱，有的还带着每个四元钱的上等花盆；树有苹果、秋白梨、东山桃、西景水蜜、蟠桃、法桐、刺槐等二十二种。
    为了把这些花木从千里之外运回兰州来，从今年三月开始，这个公司就派人到有关车站去要车皮。车站拒绝了这种不合理的运输，而且提出了严厉指责。但是，这个公司并不甘心，他们采取零担运输方式，把花陆续偷运了一些回来。不久，车站发觉了，又制止这种做法。于是，大部分花木直到现在还存在采购地点。至于少量偷运回来的花，也有一部分已经死掉了。
    这个公司这样大规模地进行绿化工程，是公司领导人员决定的。而更严重的是，绿化工程的经费在上级领导机关审核这个公司的基本建设计划时被削除了，而公司领导人员不惜违反财政纪律，从其它工程项目的经费中抽出三千八百多元钱来作为“绿化”之用。但是，当问题被揭发以后，这个公司的领导人员竟还认为“这是小事情，提不到工作日程上来”。人们感到奇怪，在全国人民热烈地为厉行节约、反对浪费而斗争的时候，为什么这个单位的领导人员还对自己的浪费行为采取这样的宽容态度呢？　晨光
    拣起芝麻扔掉西瓜的措施编辑同志：
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局吉林化学冶金建设公司在今年五月二十日发出一项长达一千多字的“理发人员劳动工资制度暂行办法”的通知，规定了理发工人的工资标准、工作时间、工资支付办法和计算公式等等。这个“暂行办法”，是花了两个月的时间，经过了各种会议的讨论，才拟订出来的；拟订后又经过吉林市劳动局批复。但是这个“暂行办法”发到所属单位以后，大家对它很冷淡，认为没啥用。
    可是，另一方面，吉林省化学冶金建设公司现行的计件工资办法中有很多漏洞，长期没有解决。例如二公司四工地四、五月份根据补充定额所签发的任务单不及时的竟占五分之一以上；一公司二工地四月份完成的土方工程量实际测量只有九千五百八十九立方公尺，而任务单上竟按一万二千八百五十一立方公尺验收，严重地浪费了国家的工资基金。劳动组织不合理，劳动力浪费现象也很严重，一月到四月仅所属三个公司平均每天就要浪费一千六百多劳动日。劳动生产率很低，月月完不成计划，一月到四月劳动生产率计划平均也只完成百分之六十四点五。
    公司领导方面为什么扔下这些最主要的问题不去认真研究改进，偏偏花那末多人力，费那末多时间搞这样一项“没啥用”的“暂行办法”呢？这不是扔掉西瓜拣起芝麻的措施吗？　方燮机
    希望把姓名地址写清楚编辑同志：
    我是搞人民来信登记工作的。在工作中最使我棘手的就是有些信尾的署名和地址写得很模糊，有时即使花了很多时间，也辨不出是什么字来。我想，写信的人，都是希望人家帮他解决问题的。如名字地址写不清，问题就不能及时得到答复或者根本无法得到答复。因此，希望写信的人，一定要把姓名、地址写清楚。　刘淑和
    一批不成套的新式农具编辑同志：
    陕西省临潼县十区栎阳供销合作社在经营新式农具的工作中，存在着严重的不负责任现象。库存的农具东丢西拉，七零八落。步犁把子被折坏了，锄草机的大轮子丢在水道口，水车管子在去冬被工作人员拿去八节做了吸火筒，麻袋霉坏得不能移动，小耘锄的螺丝活动得尖子翻得可以朝上……。农民买一件新式农具，要找好半天才能把零件凑齐。
    现在，栎阳供销合作社还有六十部解放式水车的管链、簸箕等附件长期积压在院子里。最初，还用芦席遮盖，后来风吹雨打，芦席破烂了，成了麻雀做窠的地方。粗略计算，光这些物资就值八千一百五十四元。这批水车的车身却放在县社，使水车都不能成套；群众看到这些东西常问：“水车贷不贷，给我贷一辆。”栎阳社工作人员不得不这样回答：“这是不成套的东西呀！”
    栎阳供销合作社这种对人民事业不负责任的恶劣行为，有关方面应彻底检查和纠正。　张明德
