　　The middle reaches of the Yangtze River's water level is rising, and the people along the river are tensely fighting floods.
    In most areas of the Yangtze River basin, continuous days of overcast and rain have led to the first peak of this year's flood season in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. People on both sides of the river are engaged in the fight against floods and flood control.
    During this period, the characteristics of the rising water levels in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are relatively large amplitude. The water level in Shashi rose by 6.11 meters from the 17th to the 27th; at noon on the 27th, it rose to 43.55 meters, which is nearly 4 meters higher than the water level in the same period last year (1954), exceeding the local warning water level (the Shashi water level had slightly decreased at noon on the 27th). Subsequently, Jianli and other places also exceeded the warning water level. From the 18th to 2:00 AM on the 29th, the Wuhan Guandu water level rose to 25.49 meters, an increase of 5.25 meters. On the morning of the 30th, the Wuhan Guandu water level had risen to 25.97 meters, only 3.3 decimeters away from the warning water level. The speed of water level rise in Huangshi, Anqing, Wuhu and other places is also unprecedented in recent years.
    Party and government leading departments in various places along the river are taking emergency measures to mobilize workers to the dikes and transport a large number of flood control materials to the dike sections.
    The Hubei Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on June 29, requiring leaders at all levels and all staff to mobilize urgently, overcome complacency and fluke mentality, conduct a comprehensive inspection of the current flood control preparation work, and complete it within a limited time; further strengthen the preparation work for preventing mountain floods.
    The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters held a meeting of the district flood control headquarters on the 27th to deploy the current flood control preparation work. The meeting decided to first quickly establish flood control institutions and systems in each district, quickly complete the unfinished tail-end projects, prepare for closing gates and culverts, and prepare flood control materials.
    The gates to the wharves along the river dikes in the urban area must be closed when the water level reaches 26 meters. Now, the movable gate pillars being rushed to manufacture by Wuhan Machine Tool Factory and Wuhan Hardware Manufacturing Factory have been installed one by one at the dike gates along the Yangtze River and Han River in the city.
    The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters and its ten flood control headquarters have now shifted from flood control preparation work to flood control struggle. More than 10,000 dike workers are racing against time to reinforce the weak dike sections in the pre-flood dike project, and have rushed to transport yellow soil, gravel and filter materials for blocking gates and building sub-dikes. High-rise stone slopes are also being built outside the dike sections that are vulnerable to wind and waves. The flood control telephone lines on the dikes are also being prepared for installation.

　　长江中游水位上涨沿江人民紧张防汛
    长江流域大部地区连日阴雨连绵，长江中游水位已出现今年汛期的首次高峰。沿江两岸人民正投入防汛防洪斗争。
    这一时期，长江上、中游水位上涨的特点是幅度较大。沙市水位从十七日到二十七日上涨了六点一一公尺；二十七日中午涨到四十三点五五公尺，比去年（一九五四年）同期水位高出近四公尺，超过了当地警戒水位（沙市水位在二十七日中午已稍有回落）。接着，监利等地也随着超过了警戒水位。武汉关水位从十八日到二十九日上午二时已涨到二五点四九公尺，上涨了五点二五公尺。三十日上午，武汉关水位已涨到二十五点九七公尺，距警戒水位只有三点三公寸。黄石、安庆、芜湖等地水位上涨速度，也是近年来所没有的。
    沿江各地党政领导部门正采取紧急措施，动员民工上堤，并把大批防汛器材源源运上堤段。
    湖北省人民委员会在六月二十九日发出指示，要求各级领导和全体工作人员紧急动员起来，克服麻痹思想和侥幸自满情绪，对目前防汛准备工作，进行一次全面检查，限期做好；进一步加强防山洪的准备工作。
    武汉市防汛总指挥部在二十七日召开各分区指挥部会议，布置当前的防汛准备工作。会议决定首先迅速建立各区防汛机构和制度，对尚未完工的收尾工程迅速完成，作好封闭闸门、涵洞的准备工作，作好防汛器材的准备工作。
    市区沿江堤防通各码头的闸门在水位到达二六公尺时就要封闭，现在，由武汉机器厂和武汉五金制造厂赶制的活动闸门柱，已经一根根地安装在全市沿长江和汉水的堤防闸门口上了。
    武汉市防汛总指挥部和所属的十个防汛指挥部，目前已由防汛准备工作转入防汛斗争。一万多名堤防工人正连日冒雨加固汛前堤防工程中的薄弱堤段，并已赶运了堵塞闸门和加筑子堤用的黄土，砂石和导滤材料。易受风浪袭击的堤段外面也正砌筑高层的石坦坡。堤上的防汛电话线路也在准备安装架设。
