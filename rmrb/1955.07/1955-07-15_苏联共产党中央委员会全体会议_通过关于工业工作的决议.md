Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th, TASS dispatch from Moscow, July 14th: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on July 11, 1955, adopted a resolution on the report made by Bulganin entitled "On the tasks in the further upsurge of industry, technological progress, and the improvement of production organization."

The first part of the resolution states: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union points out that in the years since the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, socialist industry has made great achievements. In terms of total industrial output, the Fifth Five-Year Plan was completed by May 1, 1955, that is, in four years and four months. This is a great victory for the Soviet people in their struggle to strengthen the economic power of the Soviet state and to further advance our country towards communism.

Heavy industry, which serves as the foundation for developing the entire national economy, continuously improving the welfare of the working people, and strengthening our national defense, has made tremendous achievements. The production of means of production will increase by at least 84 percent by the end of 1955 compared to 1950, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total industrial output of the Soviet Union.

The large-scale construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River (at Kuibyshev and Stalingrad) and many rivers in Siberia is a major achievement of the post-war period. The generating capacity of the hydroelectric power stations currently under construction in the country is nearly three times the generating capacity of all hydroelectric power stations at the beginning of 1954.

The total output of the machine-building industry in 1955 will be more than double that of 1950 and 4.6 times that of 1940. Great achievements have been made in manufacturing and mastering new and efficient machinery, equipment, and precision instruments, and in formulating and implementing advanced technological processes.

The increase in the production of the machine-building industry has made it possible to raise the level of mechanization of heavy and arduous labor in important industrial sectors such as coal mining, metallurgy, petroleum, logging, construction, transportation, and agriculture. At present, the number of tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery working in the fields of collective farms and state farms has doubled compared to 1940; on this strong technological foundation, the task of land reclamation and increasing the production of grain, industrial raw materials, and livestock products is being successfully resolved.

On the basis of the full development of heavy industry, light industry and the food industry are also developing. The production level of consumer goods in 1955 will be 72 percent higher than the production level in 1950, while the Five-Year Plan stipulated 65 percent. The summary of industrial work in recent years has once again proved the correctness of our Party's general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. The Party firmly implements this line, consistently following the instructions of the great Lenin: the production of means of production must develop faster than the production of consumer goods; this is a necessary condition for expanding socialist reproduction, and heavy industry must continue to develop faster than other sectors of the national economy in the future. The higher the level of development of heavy industry in our country, which determines the further upsurge of all sectors of the national economy, the more fully we can meet the ever-growing needs of the Soviet people, the more rapidly we can manufacture abundant consumer goods, and the more rapidly we can realize the transition from socialism to communism. To this end, it is necessary to continuously implement technological improvements in the national economy, make fuller use of existing production potential, and continuously enhance the creative initiative of the masses, and on this basis, greatly increase labor productivity.

After pointing out that the adoption of the most important scientific and technological achievements in production is very slow in some industrial sectors, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU considers that the most important tasks of Party organizations, Soviet organs, and economic organizations in industry, in addition to ensuring the completion of the national economic plan, are to vigorously improve the technological level of production. The basic conditions for solving this task should be to rapidly increase the speed of technological improvement in all sectors of industry on the basis of electrification, full mechanization, and automation of the production process, the adoption of the latest highly productive machine tools, machines, and equipment, the continuous improvement of production technology, and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Plenary Session believes that it is necessary to carry out scientific research and design work on a large scale to manufacture highly productive machine tools, automatic devices, mechanical and hydraulic presses for forging, automatic forging machines, sand casting equipment, large-horsepower steam turbines, turbo generators, water turbines, hydro generators, high-evaporation capacity boilers, gas turbine equipment, as well as diesel engines, gas turbine locomotives, internal combustion locomotives, electric locomotives, automated rolling mills, mining equipment, and instruments for automatic control and manipulation of production processes.

The Plenary Session instructed relevant personnel to formulate and implement measures for the technological transformation of existing factories—replacing outdated equipment with new, more efficient equipment and modernizing already installed equipment.

Widely promote the experience accumulated by advanced factories in strengthening the production process in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industries.

In the coal mining industry, the utilization of existing machines and machinery should be improved, and work should be carried out in various mines to create and adopt new mining technologies. In the petroleum industry, ensure the widespread use of advanced methods of oil extraction.

When implementing the construction of power stations and lines, consideration should be given to ensuring that the rate of increase in power capacity exceeds the rate of development of the entire national economy.

When designing new enterprises and expanding existing enterprises, the highest technical and economic indicators achieved by advanced enterprises at home and abroad should be taken into account.

In order to expand the work of automating production processes in the most important industrial sectors, from partial automation to full automation, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of automatic instruments and tools. The Soviet State Committee for Technology, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, various government ministries and competent authorities should improve the exchange of scientific and technological information, expand ties with foreign scientific research institutions, expand the exchange of scientific and technological information, and purchase foreign technical works. It is considered necessary to hold regular Soviet exhibitions of scientific achievements and advanced experience in the national economy, to exhibit and promote the achievements in industry, agriculture, and construction.

The resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU stipulated measures to expand the specialization and cooperation between industrial enterprises, to improve industrial management and the work of managers and experts, and to eliminate shortcomings in the distribution of domestic productive forces.

In the part of the resolution discussing the increase of labor productivity, it pointed out that labor productivity in industry in 1955 will increase to almost twice that of 1940. On this basis, the real wages of employees in the industrial sector will increase by more than 90 percent compared to the pre-war level. Ensuring this is primarily the adoption of the latest machines and machinery in production, improving technology and production organization, raising the cultural and technical level of workers and engineering and technical personnel, and developing socialist competition.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU called for attention to be paid to eliminating shortcomings in labor organization, the determination of labor quotas, wage adjustments, and the improvement of workers' living and working conditions, in order to continuously increase labor productivity in industry as a basis for ensuring a steady increase in real wages.

The resolution of the Plenary Session pointed out that planned economic development is one of the most important factors demonstrating the superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. The entire industry and most industrial enterprises not only fulfilled but even overfulfilled the production tasks every year.

However, some enterprises, and even individual industrial sectors, are still unable to fulfill the state plan.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU instructed the Central Committees and Councils of Ministers of the Communist Parties of the republics, local Party organizations and Soviet organs, ministers of various ministries, leaders of various competent authorities and enterprises, to ensure that every enterprise comprehensively fulfills the state plan in terms of the production of specified product varieties, the adoption of new technologies, and various technical and economic indicators.

The Plenary Session decided: to instruct the ministers of various ministries and leading organs at all levels to thoroughly implement Lenin's principles of state management, resolutely improve the leadership of industry, eradicate the bad phenomena of bureaucracy and irresponsibility in the work of government agencies.

It is necessary to continue to rectify the industrial management system, abolish multi-layered organizational links between ministries and enterprises, bring management organs closer to production, make agencies more streamlined, reduce them to the minimum number, but make them powerful, capable and flexible. Transfer a part of the all-Union industrial enterprises located in the territories of the republics to the leadership of the republics, and move general management bureaus, trusts, scientific research institutions, and design institutes from Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of the union republics to the concentration points of the relevant industrial sectors.

The final part of the resolution states: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU calls on Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, male and female workers, foremen, technicians, engineers, scientific workers, and staff to intensify their efforts to successfully complete the already formulated plan for the further development of socialist industry, and expresses its firm belief that our country's heroic working class, intellectuals, and all working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will certainly be able to ensure the vigorous development of industry, thereby making new contributions to the cause of further strengthening the strength of the Soviet state and to the cause of building communism in our country.

    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议
    通过关于工业工作的决议
    新华社十四日讯塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：一九五五年七月十一日苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议就布尔加宁所作的“关于在工业的进一步高涨、技术的进步和生产组织的改进方面的任务”的报告通过了一项决议。
    决议的第一部分说：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会举行以后的几年中，社会主义工业取得了很大的成就。在工业总产量方面，第五个五年计划到一九五五年五月一日就完成了，即以四年零四个月的时间完成了。这是苏联人民在争取加强苏维埃国家的经济力量、把我国进一步推向共产主义的斗争中的一个伟大的胜利。
    作为发展整个国民经济、不断提高劳动人民的福利和加强我国防御力量的基础的重工业有了巨大的成就。生产资料的生产到一九五五年年底将比一九五零年至少增加百分之八十四，占苏联工业总产量的百分之七十以上。
    在伏尔加河上（在古比雪夫和斯大林格勒）和西伯利亚许多河流上进行的规模宏大的水电站的建设，是战后时期的重大成就。目前国内正在建设中的水电站的发电能力差不多相当于一九五四年年初所有水电站的发电能力的三倍。
    一九五五年机器制造工业的总产量将增为一九五零年的二倍以上，增为一九四零年的四点六倍。在制造和掌握新式的生产效能高的机器、设备和精密仪器方面，在制定和实行先进的工艺规程方面，都有很大的成绩。
    机器制造业生产的增加使得有可能来提高采煤、冶金、石油、伐木业等重要工业部门以及建筑业、运输业和农业方面的繁重劳动和费力劳动的机械化水平。现在，在各集体农庄和国营农场田地上工作的拖拉机、谷物收割联合机和其他农业机器的数量增为一九四零年的二倍；在这样强大的技术的基础上，正在胜利解决垦荒以及增产谷物、工业原料作物和畜产品的任务。
    在全力发展重工业的基础上，轻工业和食品工业也在发展。一九五五年消费品的生产水平比一九五零年的生产水平将提高百分之七十二，而五年计划规定是百分之六十五。最近几年来的工业工作总结，又一次证明了我们党优先发展重工业的总路线的正确。党坚定地执行这个路线，它一贯遵循着伟大列宁的指示：必须比消费品的生产更加快地发展生产资料的生产，这是扩大社会主义再生产的必要条件，重工业今后仍然必须比国民经济其他各部门发展得快些。决定国民经济各部门进一步高涨的重工业在我国发展的水平愈高，我们就愈能更充分地满足苏联人民不断增长的需要，就愈能更迅速地制造丰裕的消费品和实现从社会主义到共产主义的过渡。为此，必须在国民经济中不断地实行技术改进，更充分地利用现有的生产潜力，不断地提高群众的创造主动精神，并且在这个基础上大大地提高劳动生产率。
    在指出了某些工业部门在生产中采用最重要的科学和技术上的成就是很缓慢的之后，苏共中央全体会议认为党组织、苏维埃机关和经济组织在工业方面最重要的任务，除了保证完成国民经济计划之外，就是大力提高生产的技术水平。解决这个任务的基本条件应当是在生产过程电气化、全盘机械化和自动化，采用高度生产率的最新机床、机器和设备，不断改进生产的工艺规程以及和平使用原子能的基础上，急速提高工业各部门技术改进的速度。
    全体会议认为必须大规模展开科学研究和设计工作，以制造高度生产率的机床、自动装置、锻中用机械压力机和水压机、自动压锻机、翻砂设备、大马力汽轮机、涡轮发电机、水轮机、水力发电机、高蒸发容量的锅炉、煤气涡轮装置以及柴油机、煤气涡轮机车、内燃机车、电力机车、自动化轧钢机、采矿设备以及自动控制和操纵生产过程的仪器。
    全体会议责成有关人员制定和实施关于对现有工厂进行技术改造的措施——以新的、生产效能更高的装备来更换已经陈旧的装备，使已经安装的设备现代化。
    在黑色和有色金属冶炼业中广泛推广先进工厂在强化生产过程方面所累积的经验。
    在采煤工业方面应当改进现有机器和机械的利用，在各个矿井展开创造和采用新的采矿技术的工作，在石油工业方面保证普遍地使用先进的开采石油的方法。
    在实行发电站和线路的建设时应考虑到使动力能力的提高速度超过整个国民经济的发展速度。
    在设计新的企业和扩建现有的企业的时候，应当考虑到本国和外国的先进企业所达到的最高的技术经济指标。
    为了扩大最重要的工业部门中的生产过程的自动化的工作，将生产过程的部分自动化过渡到全盘自动化，必须大大增加自动仪器和工具的生产。苏联国家技术委员会、苏联科学院、政府各部和主管机关改进科学和技术的情报交流工作，扩大同外国科学研究机关的联系，扩大科学和技术情报的交换，以及购买外国的技术著作。认为必须举办经常性的苏联的科学成就和国民经济中的先进经验展览会，以展览和宣传工业、农业和建筑业获得的成就。
    苏共中央全体会议的决议规定了扩大工业企业之间的专业化和协作的措施，以改善工业管理工作和管理人员和专家的工作，消除国内生产力分布方面的缺点等。
    决议在谈到提高劳动生产率的部分中指出，一九五五年工业的劳动生产率差不多将增加为一九四零年的两倍，在这个基础上，工业部门职工的实际工资将比战前提高百分之九十以上。保证这一点的首先是在生产中采用最新的机器和机械，改进工艺规程和生产组织，提高工人和工程技术人员的文化和技术水平，开展社会主义竞赛。
    苏共中央全会号召必须在劳动组织、确定劳动定额、调整工资和改进工人生活和劳动条件方面注意消除缺点，以便不断提高工业的劳动生产率，作为保证稳步增加实际工资的基础。
    全体会议的决议指出，计划经济发展是显示社会主义经济制度优于资本主义经济制度的最主要因素之一。整个工业和大多数工业企业每年不仅完成了而且甚至超额完成了生产任务。
    但是，有些企业，甚至个别工业部门仍然不能完成国家计划。
    苏共中央全会责成各共和国共产党中央委员会和部长会议、地方党组织和苏维埃机关、各部部长、各主管机关和企业的领导者，保证每一个企业在规定的产品品种生产方面、在采用新技术方面和各项技术经济指标方面全面地完成国家计划。
    全体会议决定：责成各部部长，各级领导机关彻底实现列宁的国家管理的原则，坚决改善对工业的领导，铲除机关工作中的官僚主义恶劣现象和对工作的不负责任的态度。
    必须继续整顿工业管理机构，撤消部和企业间多层的组织环节，使管理机关接近生产，使机关更加精简，在数量上减少到最低限度，然而办事却有力、干练和灵活。把一部分设在各共和国领土上的全苏工业企业移交给共和国领导，以及把总管理处、托辣斯、科学研究机关以及设计院从莫斯科、列宁格勒和加盟共和国首都迁移到有关工业部门的集中地点。
    决议的最后部分说：苏共中央全会号召共产党员、共青团员、男女工人、工长、技师、工程师、科学工作者和职员加紧努力，以求胜利完成已经制定的进一步发展社会主义工业的计划，并且表示坚信：我国的英雄的工人阶级、知识分子和全体劳动人民在共产党的领导下，一定能保证工业得到大力发展，从而对进一步加强苏维埃国家的力量的事业和在我国建设共产主义的事业作出新的贡献。
