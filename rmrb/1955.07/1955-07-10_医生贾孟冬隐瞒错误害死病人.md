    We are writing to you with immense anger to denounce the grave crime of Jia Mengdong, a doctor at the Third Hospital Directly Under the Central Organs of the Ministry of Health (hereinafter referred to as the Third Hospital), who caused the death of Chen Wanling.
    Chen Wanling was hospitalized in the Third Hospital on August 24th of last year for the treatment of anemia. In order to determine the source of the illness, the hospital decided that Jia Mengdong should perform a sigmoidoscopy. On August 27th, Jia Mengdong inserted the sigmoidoscope three times through the patient's anus, but was unable to insert it further. The patient screamed in agony. At that time, Jia Mengdong did not check his operating method but forcibly ordered the nurse to hold the patient down and forced the sigmoidoscope into the anus. After the examination, the patient suffered unbearable abdominal pain, developed a high fever, and passed a large amount of blood in her stool. All these symptoms indicated that the intestines had been punctured during the examination. However, Jia Mengdong did not report this situation to the attending physician, but instead fabricated a "history of high fever" for the patient and concealed the patient's bloody stools. On the 28th, Sun Jing, the attending physician of internal medicine, suspected after examining the patient that Jia Mengdong might have punctured the intestines during the sigmoidoscopy. But Jia Mengdong denied it. On the 30th, the hospital invited a professor from a certain hospital affiliated with Peking Medical College for a consultation. Jia Mengdong pretended to ask the professor if there was a possibility of intestinal rupture. The professor said, "Intestinal rupture must cause a large amount of blood in the stool." At this time, Jia Mengdong not only continued to conceal the bloody stools, but also said that the patient's condition was very good after the examination. As a result, the consultation diagnosed typhoid perforation. Jia Mengdong knew that this diagnosis was wrong, but he did not bring it up, attempting to use the professor's diagnosis to cover up his own mistake.
    Based on the diagnosis of intestinal perforation, the patient immediately underwent an abdominal ileocecal incision operation, only to find that it was not intestinal perforation; however, there was bloody mucus in the abdomen, indicating that the rectum was indeed ruptured. In order to save the patient, another incision was made in the middle of the abdomen, only to find a 4 cm long tear 6 or 7 cm away from the anus, proving that it was punctured during the sigmoidoscopy, and the puncture caused peritonitis. Because of Jia Mengdong's long-term concealment, the treatment time was delayed, and the patient finally died.
    Editor, what a shocking thing this is! Chen Wanling should not have died at all; even if the intestine was punctured, it could have been saved with emergency measures. In order to save Chen Wanling's life, more than a dozen of our classmates ran to the hospital and scrambled to give him blood transfusions, but Jia Mengdong spared no effort in using various despicable means to conceal his mistake and kill the patient!
    After the Chen Wanling incident occurred, the hospital leaders asked Jia Mengdong to conduct a review, but he attempted to shift the blame onto others, saying that "Chen Wanling's death was related to the surgical operation"; and said, "Even experts cannot make a correct diagnosis, let alone a junior doctor like me?" This fully exposes the extent to which Jia Mengdong's moral character has degenerated and decayed!
    Jia Mengdong's bad style is consistent. He completely adopts a hostile attitude towards patients. For example, Yu Bingxin, a student in our school who suffers from rheumatic heart disease, asked Jia Mengdong about her condition, and he bluntly said, "Your heart disease is incurable!" Causing the patient to cry uncontrollably. Another time, Jia Mengdong told a patient with infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis who was recovering, "Your lung disease is in its final stage and there is no hope!" There are countless examples of such malicious stimulation of patients.
    Now, Chen Wanling has been dead for more than half a year, and Jia Mengdong is still working at the Third Hospital (the Third Hospital ordered Jia Mengdong to suspend his duties for introspection on June 11th - Editor's note), and has not been punished in any way. In order to ensure the safety of the people's lives, we demand that the government punish Jia Mengdong according to law. The leaders of the Third Hospital must also make a profound review of this matter.
          All students of the third year of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University

    Editor's note: Chen Wanling's death, after examination by the Ministry of Health in conjunction with the Third Hospital, proved to be caused by Jia Mengdong's deliberate concealment of mistakes.
    After Chen Wanling's death, the Third Hospital Directly Under the Central Organs and the Ministry of Health organized special personnel to conduct multiple inspections, and submitted the inspection report to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate on April 5th of this year, requesting the court to file a public prosecution. However, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate has delayed the processing until now on the grounds of too many cases. We believe that Jia Mengdong's criminal behavior must be dealt with according to law, and we hope that relevant departments will quickly handle this matter.

### 医生贾孟冬隐瞒错误害死病人

　　医生贾孟冬隐瞒错误害死病人编辑同志：
    我们以莫大的愤恨心情向你们控诉卫生部中央直属机关第三医院（以下简称第三医院）医师贾孟冬害死陈万玲的严重罪行。
    陈万玲因患贫血症，在去年八月二十四日到第三医院住院治疗。医院为了弄清病源，决定由贾孟冬作乙性结肠镜检查。八月二十七日贾孟冬用结肠镜由患者肛门插了三次，都插不进去，病人惨叫不已。当时贾孟冬不检查自己的操作方法，竟不顾一切地强令护士把病人按住，硬把结肠镜插入肛门。检查后，病人腹部疼痛难忍，发高烧，同时大量便血。这一切症状表示肠子在作检查时被戳破了。贾孟冬却不把这种情况报告主治医生，反而捏造病人有“高烧史”，还隐瞒了病人便血的情况。二十八日，内科主治医师孙敬检查病人后，就怀疑贾孟冬在作乙性结肠镜检查时可能将肠子戳破。但贾孟冬否认了。三十日，院方请北京医学院某教授会诊，贾孟冬假意询问教授是否肠有破裂的可能？教授说：“肠破裂必然要大量便血。”这时，贾孟冬不但继续隐瞒便血情况，反说病人检查后情况很好。因此使会诊诊断为肠伤寒穿孔。贾孟冬明知道这个诊断是错误的，但他不提出来，企图利用教授的诊断掩盖自己的错误。
    根据肠穿孔的诊断，当即将病人实行腹部回盲部切开手术，才发现不是肠穿孔；但腹内有黏血，说明直肠确实破裂。为了急救病人，又在腹中部开刀，才发现距肛门六、七分处有四公分长的裂孔，证明是在作结肠镜检查时所戳破，戳破后又引起了腹膜炎。因为贾孟冬的长期隐瞒，延误了治疗时间，病人终于无法挽救而死亡了。
    编辑同志，这是一件多么骇人听闻的事情！陈万玲是完全不应该死的；即使将肠戳破，只要采取紧急措施也是完全可以挽救的。我们为了挽救陈万玲的生命，曾有十几个同学跑到医院，争着为他输血，但是贾孟冬竟不惜用各种卑劣的手段，隐瞒自己的错误，害死病人！
    陈万玲事故发生后，医院领导上要贾孟冬进行检查，他却企图嫁祸于人，说“陈万玲死亡同外科手术有关”；又说：“专家都不能作出正确诊断，何况我这个小大夫呢？”这充分地暴露了贾孟冬道德品质堕落腐朽到何种程度！
    贾孟冬的恶劣作风是一贯的。他对病人完全采取一种敌对的情绪，例如，我们学校的余冰心患风湿性心脏病，向贾孟冬询问病情时，他劈头就说：“你的心脏病根本不能治了！”害得病人痛哭不止。另一次贾孟冬给一个患浸润性肺结核而正在好转的病人说：“你的肺病已到末期，没有希望了！”这种恶意刺激病人的事例是举不胜举的。
    现在，陈万玲死去已经半年多了，而贾孟冬还在第三医院工作（第三医院已于六月十一日令贾孟冬停职反省——编者），并且没有受到任何处分。为了保证人民的生命安全，我们要求政府依法惩办贾孟冬。第三医院的领导上对这件事也必须作出深刻的检讨。
          北京师范大学中文系三年级全体学生
    编者按：陈万玲的死亡，经卫生部会同第三医院检查，证明确系贾孟冬有意隐瞒错误所造成。
    陈万玲死后，中央直属机关第三医院和卫生部曾组织专人多次检查，并在今年四月五日将检查报告提交北京市人民检察院，要求该院向人民法院提起公诉。但北京市检察院以案件过多为理由，拖延到现在未作处理。我们认为贾孟冬的犯罪行为必须依法处理，希望有关部门迅速处理这件事。
