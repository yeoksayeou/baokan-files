    The Evil Consequences of Violating the National Unified Labor Allocation Policy
    An Jing, Niu Guangde
    One day in February of this year, Jia Shengtong, a coal miner from the Songshukeng mine of the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, led two farmers into the workshop office. As soon as he entered, he said to Yan Shifang, the workshop labor organizer:
    "Old Yan, I have two fellow villagers who just came from home. Please arrange a job for them."
    "Do they have a letter of introduction? We don't need people here. Don't bring people here indiscriminately," Yan Shifang replied coldly.
    "Indiscriminately? How is it that your fellow villagers can work underground without any formalities, but mine can't? Today, you still..."
    When Yan Shifang heard that the tone was wrong, he knew that his weakness had been seized by someone else, so he quickly changed his tone and said: "What's all the fuss about? How many people are there?" As he spoke, he readily completed the procedures for them to start working.
    People who don't know the inside story might think this is an isolated strange event. In fact, this kind of thing of using personal connections to employ people and arbitrarily undermining the state's unified labor allocation policy is "commonplace" in the Xishan Coal Mine. According to preliminary statistics, in 1954 alone, the Xishan Coal Mine privately recruited 2,900 temporary workers without the consent of the government labor department. The Xishan Coal Mine has always been like this. No matter what documents people bring when looking for work, such as certificates from county, district, or township people's committees or street residents' committees, letters of introduction from supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives, or public security police stations, completion certificates from construction units, and unemployment registration cards from labor bureaus, as long as there is a piece of paper, they can be hired by the mine.
    More seriously, the Xishan Mine adopted extremely vile methods when privately recruiting workers. In May of last year, Zhao Xingjiu, the chief of the construction section, on the pretext of an urgent task, privately asked workers Bai Lianzhu, Bai Zuowu, and Zhang Taiming to write letters home to call people, causing more than 50 farmers in Wutai County to abandon their land and run to the mine to find work. Even the director of the Shipo Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wutai County secretly ran away. Lv Shantong, a farmer from Lvjia Village, Three District, Wutai County, abandoned his house and land and came to the mine with his wife and children. Although he had no formalities, he found a job at the mine. After the news of Lv Shantong's employment spread to the village, everyone said that Lv Shantong was lucky, and many people blindly ran to Taiyuan with their families. As a result, they did not find work and had to wander around Xiaozhaogou Village in the suburbs of Taiyuan, digging earthen kilns for homes, lacking clothing and food, and living a very hard life. The People's Committees of Gaoping County and Jiaocheng County called or wrote to the mine, expressing their opinions because the Xishan Mine casually recruited and took in farmers who blindly flowed into the city, but the Xishan Mine ignored these opinions and repeatedly made the same mistakes. For example, for a certain shock task, Bai Wenfang, deputy director of the Xishan Mine, personally instructed the broadcaster to publicly announce the recruitment of workers through the mine's broadcasting station. Temporary workers from the Taiyuan First Engineering Company, which was under construction near the mine at the time, rushed to sign up upon hearing the news, causing the ongoing project of the First Engineering Company to be almost forced to stop.
    Why did the leading staff of the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine do this? This is related to the leadership's thinking. Deputy Director Bai Wenfang once instructed the labor organization section, saying: "Next year's task is big, it's not easy to ask the labor bureau for people, let's recruit people first and report later, don't be afraid that it won't be approved." Since the leadership instructed this way, the subordinates followed suit. Last year, the construction section, supply section, public utilities management office, supply and marketing section, transportation section, and repair team successively recruited many temporary workers. Among the 1,480 workers recruited from January to March this year, a large portion had not been approved by the labor bureau. Once, the leadership of the Xishan Mine decided to use a batch of workers. Because the number needed was too large, they had to let the labor organization section study going to other places to recruit. Who knew that before the labor organization section could make a plan, Deputy Director Ma Ligong was already getting anxious. While the labor organization section was still studying the plan, he issued an order, ordering the section to immediately send people out to recruit people, and finally recruited more than 800 people from other places. Because the pit mouth did not need so many people, many people were left over and could not be placed.
    Because the Xishan Mine randomly recruited workers without the approval of the labor bureau or the competent department, the labor organization work of the Xishan Mine was very chaotic. Until now, the mine's leaders did not know how many people were in the entire mine, and the labor organization section did not know how many workers there were. There were more than 30 staff members in the mine, and even the personnel section did not know their origins. In other aspects, it was also chaotic. For example, when eating, temporary workers and long-term workers were mixed in the same cafeteria, and the control of the meal tickets used was not strict. Some people who were not mine workers could also buy meals at the cafeteria with tickets, and even peddlers mixed into the cafeteria to eat. As a result, many workers had to wait for more than an hour to buy meals. In terms of accommodation, many workers' families often had relatives and friends who came to the mine to find work living with them. Sometimes, when there were too many people to live in, they ran to the collective dormitory for single workers. Some peddlers and unemployed people also took the opportunity to mix in, posing as workers and living in the dormitory, which affected the workers' rest, and theft often occurred in the dormitory, affecting the workers' ability to concentrate on production. The Xishan Mine had more than 250 management personnel, but they did not try to change this chaotic situation. They paid even less attention to the lives of the recruited temporary workers, and even treated temporary workers with a bourgeois viewpoint, openly violating the provisions of the state's labor insurance regulations. When signing contracts with temporary workers, they even stipulated in the contract that "workers shall be responsible for all work-related and non-work-related injuries and deaths," which aroused the workers' dissatisfaction.
    Another evil consequence of indiscriminately recruiting and using workers is the resurgence of the foreman system! In January of this year, the Xishan Mine contracted the earthwork project for the electric tram transportation road in the Guandi Pit to Yang Shouxin, a foreman who pretended to be a worker representative. Yang Shouxin used to be a foreman and often contracted well-digging projects. After the abolition of the foreman system, he had neither a business license issued by the government nor basic workers. The mine knew about these situations, but still did not consider it at all and contracted a project to Yang Shouxin. After Yang Shouxin contracted the project, he immediately found a few helpers and went around swindling and deceiving people. In a few days, he recruited more than 500 people from various places. In addition to some farmers who were deceived by him, there were many unemployed people, peddlers, and former military officers. Yang Shouxin appointed himself as the construction brigade captain. After this "team" arrived at the Xishan Mine, the mine did not conduct any review. All negotiations were conducted with Yang Shouxin, and even the daily pre-borrowed wages and meal tickets were forwarded to the workers through Yang Shouxin. After Yang Shouxin got the money, he embezzled and squandered it, while the workers' lives were very hard and their labor morale was extremely low, which delayed the project. Finally, the Xishan Mine saw that the project was delayed for too long and the cost overruns were too large, so it had to order a shutdown. After the shutdown, the workers had nowhere to eat or live, their wages could not be settled, and they had no travel expenses to go home. The workers were forced to elect representatives to complain to the Municipal Labor Bureau. It was not until the Labor Bureau came to the Xishan Mine to investigate and mediate that the leaders of the Xishan Mine discovered the problem. After processing, the mine paid out more than 1,000 yuan to make up for the wages and dismiss the workers.
    The erroneous practices of the Xishan Coal Mine in violating the unified labor allocation policy not only caused harm to itself and caused serious political and economic losses to the state, but also disrupted the local social order. According to the household registration statistics of the Baijiazhuang Public Security Police Station near the Xishan Mine from October of last year to the present, an average of no less than 600 people come to the mine every month to find work. The two hotels in Baijiazhuang are full of people every day. These people often engage in fights and thefts, and some bad elements take the opportunity to make trouble, stealing, abducting, and defrauding in every way. Some bad elements take advantage of the mine's casual recruitment of workers to deceive farmers everywhere. For example, some farmers in Shouyang County and Qingxu County were deceived by their flowery words, under the banner of the mine needing people, to Baijiazhuang, and soon the farmers' money and luggage were stolen. In addition, all kinds of incidents such as illegally making fake seals and fake letters of introduction also emerge one after another. Although the various acts of impersonation and forgery are full of loopholes, the Xishan Mine, on the pretext of urgently needing people, does not investigate too much. As a result, the local social order is seriously affected.
    The Xishan Mine should immediately stop the behavior of randomly recruiting and using workers. This year, the task of the Xishan Mine is greater than last year, and a certain number of workers need to be added, but absolutely not because the task is large to add more people, let alone recruit workers privately without going through the labor bureau or the competent department. Facts have proved that randomly recruiting workers has not brought any benefits to the mine. On the contrary, it has caused great waste to the state. Taking the first quarter of this year as an example, due to blindly increasing workers, there were more than 8,400 wasted workdays. Therefore, it is hoped that the leaders of the Xishan Mine will adopt proper methods to solve the problem of labor shortage: on the one hand, strengthen enterprise management and improve labor productivity, so that labor can be saved; on the other hand, if urgently needed, it must be allocated through the labor department and the competent department to avoid chaos and waste.

    违反国家劳动力统一调配政策的恶果
    安静　牛光德
    今年二月里的一天，太原西山煤矿松树坑的刨煤工人贾生同带领两个农民，走进了车间办公室，
  一进门便冲着车间劳动组织员阎世芳说：
    “老阎，我有两个老乡刚从家乡来，给安排个工作吧。”
    “有介绍信没有？我们这里不用人，别瞎往这里领。”阎世芳冷冷地回答。
    “瞎领？怎么，你的老乡没什么手续能下井工作，我的老乡就不能？今天你还……”
    阎世芳一听话头不对，知道自己的小辫子叫别人抓住了，赶紧转了口气说：“这有啥嚷的，几个人？”说着便顺手办了参加工作的手续。
    不了解内情的人，也许会认为这是个别的怪事。其实，这种以私情用人、任意破坏国家劳动力统一调配政策的事，在西山煤矿里已是“家常便饭”了。根据初步的统计，在一九五四年一年中，西山煤矿未经政府劳动部门同意，私自招用的临时工人即有二千九百名。西山煤矿向来是如此，不管找工作的人拿来什么文件，如县、区、乡人民委员会或者是街道居民委员会证明，供销合作社、农业生产合作社、公安派出所的介绍信，建筑单位的完工证明信和劳动局的失业登记卡片等等，只要有个纸条，都能被矿上录用。
    更严重的是，西山矿在私自招用工人时，竟采取了极其恶劣的手段。去年五月间，施工科科长赵兴九借口任务紧急，竟私自叫工人白联珠、白作武和张太明往家乡写信叫人，使五台县有五十多个农民抛下土地，跑到了矿上找工作，连五台县石坡村农业生产合作社社长也偷偷跑出来了。五台县三区吕家庄农民吕善通，扔下房屋和土地，带着妻子和儿女来到矿上，虽没有任何手续，也在矿上找到了工作。吕善通被录用的消息传到村里后，大家都说吕善通交了好运，许多人也带着家属盲目跑来太原，结果没有找到工作，只得流落在太原郊区小枣沟村里，挖土窑为家，少衣缺食，生活很苦。高平县和交城县人民委员会，因西山矿随便招收和收留盲目流入城市的农民，曾打长途电话或写信向矿上提出意见，而西山矿对这些意见毫不理睬，依然一犯再犯。例如，为了某项突击任务，西山矿副矿长白文芳亲自指示广播员通过矿的广播站公开宣布招用工人，当时正在该矿附近施工的太原市第一工程公司的临时工人听到消息后，纷纷跑到矿上报名，致使第一工程公司正在进行的工程几乎被迫停工。
    太原西山煤矿的领导工作人员为什么这样做呢？这是和领导思想有关的。副矿长白文芳曾指示劳动组织科说：“明年任务大，向劳动局不好要人，我们先招人，后上报，不怕批不准。”既然领导上这样吩咐，于是“上行下效”。去年，施工科、供应科、公用事业管理处、供销科、运输科和修缮队等单位，就曾陆续招用了许多临时工人，在今年一至三月份招用的一千四百八十名工人中，仍有一大部分没有经劳动局批准。有一次，西山矿的领导上决定要用一批工人，因需要的数量太大，只好让劳动组织科研究到外地去招，谁知还没等劳动组织科作出计划，副矿长马立功已等得着了急，就在劳动组织科正研究计划的当儿，下了一道命令，叫科里马上派人四出招人，最后从外地招回来八百多人。因坑口并不需要这么多人，结果剩下了许多人，无法安插。
    由于西山矿不经过劳动局或主管部门批准乱招工人，使西山矿的劳力组织工作十分混乱，直到现在，矿的领导人员不知道全矿究竟有多少人，劳动组织科不知道工人究竟是多少；矿上有三十多个工作人员，连人事科都不知道他们的来历。在其他方面也混乱不堪。如吃饭时，把临时工人和长期工人混在一个食堂里吃饭，加之对使用的饭票控制不严，有些不是矿上的工人也可持票到食堂买饭，甚至连行商小贩也混进食堂吃饭。结果是不少工人排队买饭，要等一个多小时。在住宿方面，不少工人的家里因常常住着来矿上找工作的亲友，有时人多住不下，便跑到单身工人的集体宿舍里去住。有些行商小贩和无业游民也乘机混杂进去，冒充工人住在宿舍里，以致影响了工人的休息，而宿舍里还常常失盗，影响工人不能安心生产。西山矿有管理人员二百五十多人，他们没有设法改变这种混乱情况。对招来的临时工人的生活，更不注意，甚至以资产阶级的观点对待临时工人，公开违反国家劳动保险条例的规定，同临时工人订合同时竟在合同上规定了“工人因工、非因工伤亡，一律由工人负责”的条件，引起了工人的不满。
    滥招工人、滥用工人的另一个恶果是使把头制度死灰复燃了！今年一月，西山矿把官地坑电车运输道土方工程包给了一个冒充工人代表的把头杨守信。杨守信在过去是把头，常承包打井工程，取消把头制后，他既没有政府颁发的承包营业执照，又没有基本工人。这些情况矿上是知道的，仍丝毫不加考虑，把一项工程包给了杨守信。杨守信包得工程后，立即找了几个帮手，四出招摇撞骗，几天工夫便从各地收罗了五百多人，其中除一些被他骗来的农民外，有不少人是无业游民、小商贩、旧军官等，杨守信自任建筑大队长。这支“队伍”到西山矿后，矿上也没作任何审查，一应交涉都是同杨守信接头，甚至把每天的工人预借工资和饭票也通过杨守信之手转发给工人。杨守信拿到钱后，便大肆贪污、挥霍，而工人的生活却很苦，劳动情绪极低，使工程拖延。最后，西山矿见工程拖延过久，超支太大，不得已只好下令停工。停工后，工人无处食宿，工资又不能清算，想回家又没盘费，工人迫不得已选派了代表到市劳动局控告，直到劳动局到西山矿进行调查调解时，西山矿的领导人员才发现这个问题。经过处理，最后矿上又垫出了一千多元，才补发了工资，遣散了工人。
    西山煤矿违反劳动力统一调配政策的错误做法，不仅祸及本身，给国家在政治上和经济上造成了严重损失，而且也扰乱了当地的社会治安。据西山矿附近的白家庄公安派出所从去年十月到现在的户籍统计，到矿上找工作的人，平均每月不下六百人。白家庄有两个旅店，每天都住满了人。这些人经常发生打架斗殴和盗窃事件，有些坏分子更乘机捣乱，偷盗拐骗无所不为。某些坏分子乘矿上随便招用工人之机，到处诓骗农民，如寿阳县和清徐县就曾有些农民被他们花言巧语，打着矿上要人的旗号骗到了白家庄，不久把农民的钱和行李都骗了去。此外，违法制造假图章和假介绍信等形形色色的事件也层出不穷。尽管各种冒充、造假的行为破绽百出，但西山矿借口急需用人，并不过分追究。于是严重地影响了当地的社会秩序。
    西山矿应立即中止乱招乱用工人的行为。今年，西山矿的任务比去年大，需要增加一定数量的工人，但绝不能因为任务大就多多加人，更不应该不通过劳动局或主管部门私自乱招工人。事实证明，乱招工人并没有给矿上带来什么好处，相反的却给国家造成了很大浪费。仅以今年第一季度为例，由于盲目增加工人，窝工达八千四百多个工作日。因此，希望西山矿的领导人员采用正当的办法解决劳动力不足的问题：一方面，加强企业管理，提高劳动生产率，这样才可以节省劳动力；另方面，如迫切需要时，一定要经过劳动部门和主管部门的调配，以避免混乱和浪费。
