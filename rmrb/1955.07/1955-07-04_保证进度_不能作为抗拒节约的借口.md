"Guaranteeing Progress" Cannot Be Used as an Excuse to Resist Thrift
　　Wang Pu
　　Strictly examining the designs of domestically made factory buildings and modifying uneconomical parts is an important way to save investment. Because many of our design personnel lack experience and technical skills, and have generally ignored the principle that engineering design must be economical and rational in the past, there are many places in these designs that should be modified, and a lot of investment that can be saved.
　　Of course, modifying the design of factory buildings is more difficult than modifying the design of non-production buildings. The state requires that we must not delay construction progress due to design modifications. Therefore, when reviewing factory designs, leaders need to spend more energy on careful research, give fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of technical personnel, and more conscientiously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
　　However, some people exaggerate the difficulties, believing them to be insurmountable. They say, "Modifying the design will make it impossible to start construction on schedule, and saving money will make it impossible to guarantee progress." They raise the "no delaying progress" sign, neither studying whether there are places in the original design that can be modified and saved, nor studying whether the modifications will really delay progress, let alone studying how to overcome difficulties so as to achieve both savings and no impact on progress, but only stifling and stifling the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.
　　Wang Xinmin, Deputy Director of the Fourth Machine Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, is one such person with this erroneous view. Wang Xinmin went to Shanghai to preside over the review of the technical design of a factory. During the review, the original designers and the technical personnel participating in the review, based on consultations with Soviet experts, proposed changing the steel roof truss of the original design to a reinforced concrete roof truss, changing the pile foundation to a strip foundation without piles, and changing the steel windows in each living room to wooden windows. This could save a lot of investment. However, Wang Xinmin did not consider this suggestion at all. He said dogmatically: "I deny this opinion in my capacity as the director of the bureau. I have no right to approve the modification of the design and delay production." In fact, modifying the design according to the opinions of the original designers and the technical personnel participating in the review would not affect the progress. Because modifying the foundation of the original design would take time; but if it is not modified, it would take more time to drive more than 700 piles. Moreover, the construction time of the roof truss and windows is relatively late, and modifying this part of the design will not affect the progress.
　　It is not difficult to see from this example that many people who claim that "progress cannot be delayed" and are unwilling to consider modifying the design often do not come to a conclusion after painstaking research and seeking truth from facts; but use the good name of "cannot delay progress" to cover up the ideological essence that they do not intend to save money at all.
　　We must resolutely expose and stop all those who distort and resist the policy of thrift. Only in this way can we ensure that all correct austerity measures can be implemented.

　　“保证进度”不能作为抗拒节约的借口
　　王朴
    严格审查国内自作的工厂建筑的设计，修改其中不合经济要求的部分，这是节约投资的一项重要办法。由于我国很多设计人员经验不足，技术水平不高，过去又普遍忽视工程设计必须经济合理的原则，这些设计中应该修改的地方、可以节省的投资是很多的。
    当然，修改工厂建筑的设计，要比修改非生产性建筑的设计困难。国家要求我们不能因为修改设计而推迟建设进度。所以，在审查工厂设计时，领导人员就需要花费更多的精力来缜密研究，更充分地发挥技术人员的积极性和创造精神，更认真地学习苏联的先进经验。
    但是，有些人却把困难夸大了，认为它是不可克服的。他们说：“要修改设计就不能按期开工，要节约就不能保证进度。”他们举起“不允许耽误进度”的禁牌，既不去研究原设计中有没有可以修改、节约的地方，也不去研究修改以后是不是真的会耽误进度，更不去研究如何克服困难，做到既能节约又不影响进度，只是窒息和扼杀群众的热情和创造精神。
    第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局副局长王新民就是有这种错误观点的一个人。王新民曾到上海去主持审查一个工厂的技术设计，在审查时，原设计人员和参加审核的技术人员根据向苏联专家请教的结果，提出把原设计的钢屋架改成钢筋混凝土屋架，把打桩的基础改成不打桩的带形基础，把各个生活间的钢窗改成木窗。这样可以节省不少投资。但是，王新民对这个建议根本不加考虑。他武断地说：“我以局长的身份否定这个意见。我没有权利批准修改设计，耽误生产。”实际上按照原设计人员和参加审核的技术人员的意见修改设计，并不会影响进度。因为修改原设计的基础，固然需要时间；但如果不修改，要多打七百多根桩，同样要多花费时间。而且屋架和窗户的施工时间比较晚，修改这部分设计更不会影响进度。
    从这个例子不难看出，有许多声称“不能耽误进度”而不肯考虑修改设计的人，往往不是经过苦心研究，实事求是地得出结论来的；而是借“不能耽误进度”的美名，掩盖他根本不打算节约的思想实质。
    对一切歪曲和抵抗节约方针的人，我们必须坚决地加以揭露和制止。只有这样，我们才能保证一切正确的节约措施能够实现。
