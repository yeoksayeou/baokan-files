　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: According to Vietnam News Agency on July 13th: Saigon residents held a strike and closed shops on July 10th to protest the South Vietnamese authorities' delay in responding to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal to hold a consultative conference to discuss the issue of general elections.

　　After noon on the 10th, the streets of Saigon, which are usually crowded with people, suddenly became deserted. On the Galliéni Avenue connecting Saigon and堤岸 (Cholon), only a few cars were driving. All taxi drivers went on strike. Tricycle workers took the chains off their tricycles and rested under the trees. Some open-air markets were also deserted.

　　Ngô Đình Diệm's police went door-to-door questioning people and telling them to go out into the streets. However, many people told the police that it was Sunday and that they were "willing to stay at home rather than go out."

　　Usually, there are many pedestrians on the streets of Saigon late at night. But on that day, only military vehicles drove through the streets, breaking the silence.

　　Prior to this, more than a thousand residents of Saigon held a demonstration on July 3rd, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities correctly implement the Geneva Accords.

    抗议南越当局延不答复协商会议的建议
    西贡人民罢工罢市
    新华社河内十三日电  据越南通讯社十三日讯：西贡居民在七月十日举行了一次罢工和罢市，抗议越南南方当局延不答复越南民主共和国政府提出的关于举行协商会议来讨论普选问题的建议。
    在十日中午以后，西贡市通常挤满人群的街道突然变得冷冷清清。在连接西贡和堤岸的加里埃尼大道上，只有寥寥几辆汽车在行驶。全部出租汽车都罢工了。三轮车工人把他们的三轮车上的链条拿了下来，在树底下休息。一些露天市场也是冷清清的。
    吴庭艳的警察挨家盘问，并且要人们到街上去。但是许多人对警察说，这天是星期日，他们“愿意留在家里，而不愿意出去”。
    往常，西贡街道上深夜仍然有许多行人来往。但是在那一天，只有军车在街道上驶过，打破沉寂。
    在此以前，西贡的一千多名居民还曾经在七月三日举行示威游行，要求南越当局正确地履行日内瓦协定。
