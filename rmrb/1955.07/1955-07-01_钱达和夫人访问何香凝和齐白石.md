The host also presented the guests with her own collection of paintings and two original paintings. He Xiangning also inscribed a poem on a plum blossom painting, saying: "There are tall branches in the south, the plum blossoms bloom first on the ridge, standing tall against the wind, unafraid of snow and frost."
    Qi Baishi, chairman of the China Artists Association, warmly received the guests and presented Mrs. Chand with one of his own paintings. Mrs. Chand said happily, "We have known Mr. Qi Baishi in India for a long time, and we are very happy to see him today." She presented Qi Baishi with two portraits of Tagore painted by herself.

Mr. Chand greatly appreciated the painting "Tent School" by the young painter Huang Zhou and the sculpture "Reading to Grandpa" by Chen Heting. He said, "Indian artists should also learn to paint works that express the new life."

　　钱达和夫人访问何香凝和齐白石
    本报讯　印度文化代表团团长钱达先生和夫人三十日在北京访问了何香凝和齐白石，参观了中国美术家协会展览馆。
    在访问何香凝时，钱达夫人送给何香凝自己画的两幅“泰戈尔像”。主人也把自己的画集和两幅亲笔画赠给客人。何香凝并在一幅梅花画上题诗说：“南国有高枝，先开岭上梅，临风高挺立，不畏雪霜花。”
    中国美术家协会主席齐白石热情地接待了客人，并送了钱达夫人一幅自己作的画。钱达夫人高兴地说：“我们在印度很早就知道齐白石先生，今天看到了，真高兴”。她把自己画的两幅泰戈尔像赠给齐白石。齐白石仔细地观看着钱达夫人作的画，连声说：“画得好极了”。为了纪念这次会见，他们同齐白石、徐悲鸿夫人坐在一起照了像。
    在参观展览馆时，他们仔细看了陈列的约三百件美术作品。中国名画家陈半丁、于非暗和著名的民间艺术家张景祜，也陪同贵宾一道参观。当钱达先生看到岑学恭画的一幅彩墨画“四川梯田”时，高兴地说：“在印度也有这样的景色”。钱达先生对青年画家黄胄画的“帐篷小学”和陈鹤亭作的“读给爷爷听”的雕塑，很赞赏，他说：“印度的美术家也应该学习画一些表现新生活的作品”。
    随后，贵宾们还到北京图书馆参观了“中印文化交流展览”，到中山公园水榭参观了“印度艺术品展览会”。
