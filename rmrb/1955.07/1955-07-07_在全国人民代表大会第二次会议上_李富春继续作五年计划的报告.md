At the Second Session of the National People's Congress
　　Li Fuchun Continues to Deliver Report on the Five-Year Plan

　　Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Director of the State Planning Commission, continued to deliver a report on behalf of the State Council at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on the afternoon of the 6th, entitled "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy."
　　At today's meeting, Li Fuchun continued to explain the third part of his report – "Several Issues of the First Five-Year Plan."
　　The third part of Li Fuchun's report is divided into nine issues, namely: basic construction of industry and transportation, industrial production, agricultural production increase, socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, ensuring market stability, training construction cadres, raising the people's material and cultural living standards, practicing strict economy, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and our country's construction.
　　In the first issue, Li Fuchun explained the size of the basic construction scale, the proportion of investment in light and heavy industries, the coordination of large, medium and small enterprises, the regional distribution of industry, basic construction standards, and ensuring project quality.
　　Li Fuchun believes that under the current conditions, the determined scale of basic construction is appropriate and should and can be strived for completion. He analyzed from various aspects that those who advocate reducing the scale of the five-year construction, intending to lighten the responsibilities they should bear and are capable of bearing, or who believe that the scale of construction can be expanded indefinitely regardless of possible objective conditions, are not to be adopted.
　　Li Fuchun said that China's first five-year plan stipulates that the proportion of investment in heavy industry is particularly large, and even larger than the proportion of investment in heavy industry in the Soviet Union's first five-year plan. This is because China's original heavy industrial base is particularly weak, and we need to actively and continuously expand the heavy industrial base to promote the overall development of the national economy; at the same time, light industry still has a considerable amount of unused potential, and there are also vast handicrafts that can serve as important supplements. He pointed out that the current development of China's light industry is mainly not a matter of increasing investment, but a matter of increasing raw material production.
　　Li Fuchun explained that the five-year basic construction plan has already made a more reasonable deployment of regional distribution. That is: on the one hand, reasonably utilize the industrial foundations of Northeast China, Shanghai, and other cities to give play to their role, so as to rapidly expand the scale of production, supply the needs of the national economy, and support the construction of new industrial areas; on the other hand, actively carry out the construction of new industrial bases in North China, Northwest China, and Central China, and start partial industrial construction in Southwest China. At the same time, according to this industrial deployment policy, the task of urban construction is not to develop large coastal cities, but to develop small and medium-sized cities in the interior, and appropriately restrict the development of large cities.
　　Li Fuchun emphasized that it is necessary to distinguish between productive construction and non-productive construction, so as to save funds and use them to increase productive construction to accelerate the speed of our country's construction.
　　When explaining the second issue, namely the issue of industrial production, Li Fuchun particularly pointed out that the completion of the industrial production plan within five years mainly relies on existing enterprises. According to the overall industrial output value of the country, approximately 70 percent of the increased output value in 1957 compared to 1952 was produced by existing enterprises, while the output value increased by newly built and significantly renovated enterprises only accounted for about 30 percent. In addition to supplying new enterprises with equipment and materials and meeting the daily needs of the people, existing enterprises also undertake major tasks such as accumulating funds and training cadres for the country. Therefore, it is necessary to attach importance to the production work of existing enterprises, give full play to the potential of existing enterprises, and strive to overfulfill the production plan. Li Fuchun also emphasized the important role of China's local industry and handicrafts in supplying the production and living needs of urban and rural people.
　　Li Fuchun then separately explained the three issues that are decisive for completing and overfulfilling the industrial production targets stipulated in the five-year plan, namely, increasing production and saving industrial raw materials, trial-producing new types of products, and improving the level of enterprise management.
　　The third issue explained by Li Fuchun was the issue of agricultural production increase. He pointed out that preventing and overcoming the disconnection between agriculture and industry is a major and urgent task in building socialism. He said that the agricultural production increase targets stipulated in the first five-year plan are high because they are based on the bumper harvest of agricultural products in 1952, and because the agricultural production in the first two years did not complete the original plan due to disasters, the production increase tasks in the last three years have been increased. Therefore, great efforts must be made to achieve the targets.
　　Li Fuchun made specific explanations on three issues: agricultural collectivization, agricultural production increase measures, and leadership of agricultural production. Li Fuchun said that during the first five-year plan, it is necessary to actively and step by step organize agricultural production cooperatives based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, relying on poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), and firmly uniting with middle peasants. The state will fully support the development of agricultural production cooperatives in terms of financial and material resources. Li Fuchun also emphatically explained the major agricultural production increase measures such as reclaiming cultivable wasteland, building water conservancy projects, fully utilizing land, increasing the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, and using new agricultural tools.
　　Regarding the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Li Fuchun focused on explaining the steps of transformation, the deployment of the transformation of capitalist industry, the deployment of the transformation of capitalist commerce, and the fact that capitalists must abide by national laws and accept transformation.
　　Li Fuchun said that during the first five-year plan, the transformation of private industry and commerce is expected to achieve the following achievements: most of the private industry will be transformed into various forms of state capitalism, and most of the private modern industry will be transformed into advanced forms of state capitalism, namely joint state-private ownership; more than half of the private commerce will be transformed into various forms of state capitalist commerce and small businesses organized by small vendors and peddlers in cooperative forms.
　　When Li Fuchun talked about the fifth issue, he pointed out that ensuring market stability is a necessary condition for completing the first five-year plan. In this issue, Li Fuchun particularly explained the major achievements since the implementation of the planned purchase and supply policy of grain. He pointed out that this policy is completely necessary and must be resolutely implemented, but the specific methods should be continuously improved to overcome shortcomings and consolidate achievements.
　　Li Fuchun talked about the issue of training construction cadres. He pointed out that one of the major political tasks that must be completed in the first and second five-year plans is to train a large number of engineering and technical personnel who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the socialist cause with modern scientific knowledge, train skilled workers, and train specialized talents in various fields. He focused on gradually improving the quality of students in universities and secondary specialized schools, attaching importance to the in-service cadre and employee spare-time education plans, and rationally using and improving existing scientific and technical personnel.
　　Li Fuchun explained that the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in our country have been gradually improving since liberation, and the various targets and measures stipulated in the five-year plan will further improve the living standards of the people across the country on the original basis. When he talked about this issue, he pointed out that the targets stipulated in the five-year plan regarding improving the people's living standards are the limits that can be achieved at present, and these targets and measures must be guaranteed to be achieved as much as possible. He said that the only broad road for the people of our country to improve their living standards is to improve our country's productivity through their own diligent and thrifty labor, and there are no other shortcuts.
　　Li Fuchun then spent more time explaining the eighth issue, namely the issue of practicing strict economy. He pointed out the importance and urgency of practicing strict economy to accumulate funds for our country's construction. We should learn from the spirit of the Soviet people who scrimped and saved to build hard during the first five-year plan, and continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of the Chinese people. He called on the people of the whole country, especially all employees, to mobilize actively to participate in the struggle of various enterprises and institutions to save funds, oppose waste, and supervise finances.
　　In the third part of the report, Li Fuchun also particularly pointed out that the reason why our country can implement the first five-year plan so quickly is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially from the assistance of the Soviet Union. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially to the great, long-term, comprehensive, and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. In order to consolidate and develop our country's socialist construction, it is necessary to further consolidate and develop our country's economic alliance and friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, so as to promote the common upsurge of the socialist camp's economy and enhance the strength of world peace and democracy.
　　In the final part of the report, Li Fuchun put forward the call to "Strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan."
　　Li Fuchun said that our country's first five-year plan has been implemented for two years. The annual plans for 1953 and 1954 have been successfully realized under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government and through the efforts of the people across the country. It is entirely possible to complete and strive to overfulfill the various targets stipulated in the five-year plan. Of course, the tasks in all aspects of our country's first five-year plan are very arduous. The tasks in the last three years are more arduous than in the first two years. We must fully estimate the difficulties caused by the contradiction between technical talents, equipment supply, and construction needs, the difficulties caused by the backwardness of agriculture compared to the rapid development of industry, and the difficulties in the overall arrangement of various economic components in the process of socialist transformation. Facing these difficulties, we must most rationally and most effectively utilize human, material, and financial resources, strengthen work in all aspects, and adopt appropriate measures to overcome them. Regarding domestic and foreign enemies, we must maintain full vigilance at all times and defeat their sabotage and resistance.
　　Li Fuchun pointed out that the first five-year plan is a program of decisive significance for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people of the whole country to strive to realize the general task of the transition period, and the people of the whole country have the responsibility to strive for the full realization of the five-year plan. He also pointed out the importance of learning from all fraternal countries, especially from the Soviet Union, for the smooth completion of the five-year plan.
　　Li Fuchun finally said that our country's first five-year plan is a great plan. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." The responsibility of each of us is significant, and our experience is not enough. We must work diligently and conscientiously, and at the same time we must have the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, persevering, and striving for revolutionary victory as in the past. We have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the country's domestic and foreign policies are correct. As long as the people of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all patriotic people unite and work hard, we will surely be able to victoriously complete and overfulfill our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy.

　　在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
　　李富春继续作五年计划的报告
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理、国家计划委员会主任李富春六日下午在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上代表国务院继续作“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。
    李富春在今天的会议上继续对他的报告的第三部分——“第一个五年计划的若干问题”作了说明。
    李富春的报告的第三部分共分九个问题，这就是：关于工业和运输业的基本建设问题、关于工业的生产问题、关于农业的增产问题、关于对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题、关于保证市场的稳定问题、关于培养建设干部问题、关于提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平问题、关于厉行节约问题、关于苏联和各人民民主国家同我国建设的关系。
    在第一个问题中，李富春对基本建设规模的大小、轻重工业投资的比重、大中小型企业的配合、工业的地区分布、基本建设的标准、保证工程的质量等问题作了说明。
    李富春认为在目前条件下，已经确定的基本建设规模是适当的，是应当而且可以争取完成的。他从各方面分析了那种主张削减五年建设的规模，打算减轻自己所应该担当并且能够担当的责任，或者认为可以不顾可能的客观条件而无限制地扩大建设规模，都是不能采取的。
    李富春说，我国第一个五年计划规定重工业投资的比重特别大，而且比苏联第一个五年计划重工业投资的比重还要大。这是因为我国原有重工业的基础特别薄弱，需要我们积极地长期地去扩大重工业的基础以促进国民经济的全面发展；同时，轻工业还有相当大的一部分没有使用的潜在力量，并且还有广大的手工业可以做重要的补充。他指出我国目前轻工业的发展，主要还不是增加投资的问题，而是增加原料生产的问题。
    李富春说明，五年基本建设计划已经对地区的分布作了比较合理的部署。这就是：一方面合理地利用东北、上海和其他城市的工业基础，发挥它们的作用，以便迅速地扩大生产规模，供应国民经济的需要，支援新工业地区的建设；另方面则积极地进行华北、西北、华中等地新的工业基地的建设，在西南开始部分的工业建设。同时根据这种工业部署的方针，城市建设的任务就不是发展沿海的大城市，而是要在内地发展中小城市，并适当地限制大城市的发展。
    李富春强调指出必须把生产性的建设和非生产性的建设这两种标准区别开来，以便节约资金，用于增加生产性的建设，来加速我国建设的速度。
    李富春在说明第二个问题，即关于工业的生产问题时，特别指出，五年内工业生产计划的完成，主要地依靠原有的企业。按照全国的工业总产值大体计算，一九五七年比一九五二年新增加的产值中约有百分之七十左右为原有企业所增产，由新建和重大改建的企业增产的还只占百分之三十左右。原有企业除供应新建企业以设备、材料和满足人民所需要的日用品外，还担负着为国家积累资金和培养干部等重大任务。因此，必须重视现有企业的生产工作，充分发挥现有企业的潜在力量，争取超额完成生产计划。李富春同时还强调我国地方工业和手工业在供应城乡人民的生产需要和生活需要方面的重要作用。
    李富春接着就完成和超额完成五年计划规定的工业生产指标有决定意义的三个问题，即增产和节约工业原料、试制新种类产品、提高企业管理工作的水平等问题，分别作了说明。
    李富春说明的第三个问题，是关于农业的增产问题。他指出，防止和克服农业同工业的脱节，是建设社会主义事业中重大而又迫切的任务。他说，第一个五年计划规定农业的增产指标因为是以农产品丰收的一九五二年为基数，所以是高的，而且因为前两年的农业生产由于灾荒没有完成原定计划，就增加了后三年的增产任务。因此，要达到指标还必须作很大努力。
    李富春就关于农业的合作化、农业的增产措施、对农业生产的领导等三个问题作了具体说明。李富春说，在第一个五年计划期间，必须积极地有步骤地在自愿互利原则的基础上，依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农）。巩固地团结中农，组织农业生产合作社。国家在财力物力上，将全力支持农业生产合作社的发展。李富春并且着重地说明了开垦宜于耕种的荒地，兴修水利，充分地利用土地，增加稻米、玉米、薯类等高产量等作物的播种面积、使用新式农具等重大的农业增产措施。
    关于对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题，李富春着重说明了改造的步骤、资本主义工业改造的部署、资本主义商业改造的部署、资本家必须遵守国家法律接受改造等问题。
    李富春说，在第一个五年计划期间，预计对于私营工商业的改造将达到如下的成就，就是：私营工业的大部分将转变为各种形式的国家资本主义，而私营的现代工业的大部分将转变为高级形式的国家资本主义即公私合营；私营商业中有一半以上将转变为各种国家资本主义形式的商业和由小商小贩组织起来的合作形式的小商业。
    李富春在谈到第五个问题时指出，保证市场的稳定，是完成第一个五年计划的必要条件。在这个问题中，李富春特别说明了粮食的计划收购和计划供应政策实施以来的重大成就。他指出，这个政策是完全必要和必须坚决贯彻的，但是具体办法应该不断改善，克服缺点，巩固成绩。
    李富春谈到了培养建设干部的问题。他指出，第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划中必须完成的重大政治任务之一，就是培养大量的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的工程技术人员，培养熟练工人，以及各方面的专门人材。他着重对逐步提高高等学校和中等专科学校学生质量、重视在职干部和职工业余教育计划、合理使用和提高现有科学技术人员等问题，作了说明。
    李富春说明，解放以来我国各族人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平是逐步地提高的，五年计划规定的各项指标和措施，又将使全国人民的生活水平在原来的基础上有新的提高。他在谈到这个问题时指出，五年计划规定的关于提高人民生活水平的指标是目前可能实现的限度，这些指标和措施必须尽可能地保证实现。他说，我国人民提高生活水平的唯一康庄大道，是靠自己克勤克俭的劳动来提高我国的生产力，其他的捷径是没有的。
    李富春接着以较多的时间说明了第八个问题，即厉行节约的问题。他指出厉行节约以积累资金对于我国建设的重要性和迫切性，我们应该学习苏联人民在第一个五年计划时节衣缩食刻苦建设的精神，继续发扬我国人民艰苦奋斗的优良传统。他号召全国人民首先是全体职工都要动员起来，积极地参加各个企业和机关的节约资金、反对浪费、监督财务的斗争。
    李富春在报告的第三部分中，还特别指出我国所以能够这样迅速地实行第一个五年计划，是同苏联和各人民民主国家的援助分不开的，特别是同苏联的援助分不开的。中国政府和中国人民对苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，特别是对苏联的伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢。为着巩固和发展我国的社会主义建设事业，就必须进一步地巩固和发展我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济联盟和友好合作，以促进社会主义阵营经济的共同高涨，增强世界和平民主的力量。
    李富春在报告的最后部分提出了“为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗”的号召。
    李富春说，我国第一个五年计划已经执行了两年。一九五三年和一九五四年的年度计划，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的指导下，经过全国人民的努力，已经胜利地实现。完成和争取超额完成五年计划所规定的各项指标是完全有可能的。当然，我国第一个五年计划，不论那一方面的任务，都很艰巨。后三年的任务要比前两年更为艰巨。我们必须充分估计到技术人材、设备供应同建设需要的矛盾而发生的困难，农业落后于工业的迅速发展而发生的困难，以及在社会主义改造过程中各种经济成份统筹安排的困难。面对着这些困难，我们必须最合理地和最有效地利用人力、物力和财力，加强各方面的工作和采取适当的办法，加以克服。对于国内外敌人，我们必须随时地保持充分的警惕，战胜他们的破坏和反抗。
    李富春指出，第一个五年计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领，全国人民都负有为全部实现五年计划而奋斗的责任。他同时指出了向所有的兄弟国家学习，特别是向苏联学习，对于顺利完成五年计划的重要性。
    李富春最后说，我国第一个五年计划是一个伟大的计划。像毛泽东主席所说的：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”我们每一个人的责任是重大的，我们的经验又不够，我们必须勤勤恳恳地和兢兢业业地做工作，同时又必须具有像过去那样不怕困难、百折不回、争取革命胜利的精神。我们有中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，国家对内对外的政策是正确的，只要我们全国各族人民群众、各民主阶级、各民主党派、一切爱国人士团结起来，努力奋斗，我们就一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。（新华社）
