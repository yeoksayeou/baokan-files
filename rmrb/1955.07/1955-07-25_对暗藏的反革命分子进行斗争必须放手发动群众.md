To Fight Against Covert Counter-Revolutionaries, We Must Boldly Mobilize the Masses

Since liberation, our country has carried out a large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, eliminating a large number of open and exposed counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, it has also removed some covert counter-revolutionaries from factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, the army, and broad urban and rural areas, including secret agents and spies sent in and buried by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This has played a significant role in safeguarding national economic construction, protecting the safety of people's lives and property, and consolidating the people's political power.

However, there is still a considerable number of open and exposed counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated, and the number of covert counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated is far greater. They hide themselves, some disguise themselves as revolutionaries, and take advantage of our 麻痹大意 [ma bi da yi - negligence] to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks and even the Communist Party. The recently exposed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is one example. Now, our socialist construction and socialist transformation are being carried out on a large scale. To obstruct our country's socialist cause, American imperialism and its running dogs are carrying out war threats against our country and intensifying their counter-revolutionary espionage activities. The counter-revolutionaries from the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated in the country are gradually colluding with secret agents and spies to intensify their sabotage of the people's revolution and socialist cause. In rural areas, the enemy is taking advantage of certain weaknesses and difficulties in our rural work to actively spread rumors, provoke disturbances, and carry out assassinations and sabotage activities. In factories and mining enterprises, the enemy is taking advantage of our lax systems and the low technical capabilities of our cadres to create various destructive accidents. Enemies who have infiltrated our state organs and the Communist Party are stealing our political, economic, and military secrets and supplying them to imperialism. These situations show that our struggle against counter-revolutionaries has entered a new stage that is more concealed, more complex, and more acute.

Eliminating covert counter-revolutionaries is a necessary task to ensure the consolidation of our people's democratic dictatorship, the smooth success of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and is one of the important tasks of the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

How can we eliminate all covert counter-revolutionaries? The experience of the past few years tells us that to eliminate all covert counter-revolutionaries, we must rely on the correct leadership of the leading organs and the high awareness of the broad masses of the people, and we must rely on the specialized work of the public security and security organs and the active participation of the broad masses of the people in the anti-espionage and anti-special agent struggle. Every victory we have achieved on this front in the past has directly or indirectly obtained the support and help of the people. The people have provided a large number of clues and reliable evidence, and have assisted the public security and security organs in solving many difficult cases. This conscious action of the people has left counter-revolutionaries with nowhere to hide. If we are to achieve greater victories on this front in the future, until all covert counter-revolutionaries are eliminated, we must extensively and deeply mobilize the masses, so that the specialized work of the public security and security organs and the anti-espionage and anti-special agent struggle of the broad masses of the people can be better closely combined.

However, there is an erroneous idea among some of our comrades, that is, they believe that in the past, when suppressing counter-revolutionary movements, we could rely on the masses to deal with relatively open and exposed counter-revolutionaries, but now, to deal with hidden enemies, it is enough to rely on the leadership and specialized organs, and there is no need to mobilize the broad masses to participate. They use the pretext that this work is confidential, fearing that the masses will know and leak secrets; they also use the pretext that this struggle is complex, fearing that the masses will mess things up or make mistakes after participating. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, some of our leaders are tied hand and foot when it comes to the current struggle to eliminate covert counter-revolutionaries in state organs, Party organizations, people's organizations, cultural and educational organs, and economic organs, and they dare not boldly and freely mobilize the masses. They are afraid that the atmosphere in the organs will become tense, and they arrange the current movement as if it were peacetime. Their actions are slow, the struggle cannot be carried out, and some even criticize impatience too early at large and small meetings when the masses' fighting spirit is high and they sharply expose counter-revolutionary statements and actions, and hurriedly announce "discipline," which is essentially pouring cold water on the masses. Some units do not earnestly mobilize the masses to carry out struggles and expose counter-revolutionary words and deeds, attempting to replace mass movements with judicial means, and arresting a few counter-revolutionaries to settle the matter. Some units also use the excuse of being busy with work to not seriously carry out struggles. In units where the masses have not been mobilized, there are still many counter-revolutionaries carrying out various sabotage activities during the movement, refusing to confess, threatening waverers, obstructing others from being frank, destroying documents, and forming "offensive and defensive alliances." The arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries has not been suppressed. In addition, there are ideas of mystification and isolationism among some of our specialized organs and personnel. This kind of thinking is manifested in their constant struggle against covert counter-revolutionaries, in that they do not pay attention to educating, organizing, and mobilizing the masses to participate in this struggle, and they do not see the strength of the masses. Many places discover counter-revolutionary sabotage accidents and do not mobilize the masses to assist in the investigation, and they secretly wipe out counter-revolutionary slogans without daring to let the masses see them, supposedly because they are afraid that the masses will see and be adversely affected. Many counter-revolutionary cases are investigated solely by specialized organs, without mobilizing the masses to assist in solving the cases. Some cases that have been solved that should be publicized to the masses are not publicized to the masses, thus blinding the eyes of the masses, which in turn facilitates the activities of counter-revolutionaries. In many places and departments, the struggle against covert counter-revolutionaries is still limited to a few leaders and specialized organs fighting alone, the scope of the struggle is very small, and it cannot form a massive force. This is the main reason why covert counter-revolutionaries have not been fundamentally struck. The ideas of mystification and isolationism not only hinder the combination of specialized organs and the masses, but also seriously hinder the mutual coordination and unified operations of various departments fighting against the enemy. In addition, although some people believe in their minds that the struggle against covert counter-revolutionaries must rely on the masses, they lack concrete methods on how to rely on the masses, how to combine the work of specialized organs with the anti-espionage and anti-special agent struggle of the broad masses of the people, and they have no active actions, so their mass line remains only on paper and has not been solved in actual work.

Why must the struggle against covert counter-revolutionaries rely on the masses? Because covert counter-revolutionaries, especially the secret agents and spies of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are the most dangerous enemies of our country and people, and their actions seriously endanger the interests of the country and all the people. If their conspiracy succeeds, it will be a counter-revolutionary restoration, which will cause China to regress for decades. Therefore, eliminating covert counter-revolutionaries is an issue that everyone should be closely concerned about, and it is everyone's inescapable responsibility. Therefore, such a serious struggle cannot be regarded as a matter for a few leaders and specialized personnel that is irrelevant to the majority of people. Everyone knows that covert counter-revolutionaries are ubiquitous and will seize any opportunity. As long as they find that there are weaknesses to exploit, that defenses are lax, and that leaders and the masses are not vigilant, they will infiltrate there. Therefore, if any place, department, or corner does not raise the vigilance of the masses and organize the anti-espionage and anti-special agent work of the masses, it is possible for covert enemies to infiltrate. It is not enough to rely solely on the eyes of a few leaders and public security organs for covert counter-revolutionaries. Only when everyone's eyes are opened will counter-revolutionaries have nowhere to hide. We cannot fail to rely on the masses simply because the activities of counter-revolutionaries are more concealed and the struggle is more complex. On the contrary, it is precisely because counter-revolutionaries are more concealed and the struggle is more complex that it is even more necessary to rely on the masses and to have millions of eyes to monitor the enemy. Isn't the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and many other covert counter-revolutionaries a good proof? Doesn't it prove that as long as the eyes of the masses are opened, it is difficult for any cunning counter-revolutionary to hide? It should be noted that counter-revolutionaries can sometimes deceive the leadership and also the public security organs, but they cannot deceive the broad masses of cadres and all the people. This is because any counter-revolutionary must live among the masses, and no cunning counter-revolutionary is "seamless." Counter-revolutionaries always have origins, always have suspicious histories, and if they are counter-revolutionary, they will have counter-revolutionary activities. If they have counter-revolutionary activities, there will be a possibility of being discovered. The reason why covert counter-revolutionaries were not completely exposed in the past was not entirely because of their high skills, but mainly because we did not mobilize all the cadres and the masses, and raise their vigilance to fight against covert counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, in the future, the entire Party and the people of the whole country must be mobilized to eliminate all covert counter-revolutionaries. The power of the people is great, and the eyes of the people are sharp. What counter-revolutionaries fear most is the mobilization of the masses and the raising of the masses' vigilance. Because the masses know the details of counter-revolutionaries best and can expose the true face and all the crimes of counter-revolutionaries. As long as the masses are mobilized, the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries will be suppressed, and counter-revolutionaries will have to bow their heads.

After the masses are mobilized, will they mess up the struggle or make mistakes? Of course, the possibility of messing up or making mistakes is not completely non-existent, but the problem does not lie with the masses, but with the leadership. Places where things are messed up and mistakes are made are often places where leaders are irresponsible or do not actively take responsibility for leadership. If the leadership can attach importance to the work of eliminating covert counter-revolutionaries, the leaders are responsible, personally take action, correctly implement the central government's policies on eliminating covert counter-revolutionaries, and rely on the masses, summarize the experience of the masses' struggle, and use it to educate the masses, then things will not be messed up or mistakes will be made. Conversely, if the leaders are irresponsible or do not actively take responsibility, do not mobilize the masses or do not fully mobilize the masses to fight against covert counter-revolutionaries, and do not constantly educate the masses in the struggle, then there is a high possibility of problems and errors. Experience has proved that the more fully the masses are mobilized, the brighter the eyes of the masses are, the easier it is to expose covert counter-revolutionaries, the easier it is to overcome the two tendencies of numbness and "草木皆兵" [cao mu jie bing - seeing ghosts everywhere], the easier it is to avoid the mistakes of random arrests and "逼、供、信" [bi, gong, xin - extorting confessions and believing them], and the easier it is to correctly realize the policy of "raising vigilance, eliminating all secret agents; preventing deviations, and not wronging a single good person." At the same time, the higher the vigilance of the masses, the more they can keep the secrets of the Party and the state, and keep the secrets of the struggle against covert counter-revolutionaries. It is also wrong to use the excuse of being too busy with work and not mobilizing the struggle, and to put business work and the elimination of covert counter-revolutionaries in opposition to each other. If covert counter-revolutionaries are not eliminated, there is no guarantee that business work will be done well. It is true that the business work of our various organs is very busy, but we cannot therefore fail to eliminate covert counter-revolutionaries. We should appropriately combine business and political work. We must both do a good job in business work and eliminate covert counter-revolutionaries. All excuses for not mobilizing the masses to fight against covert counter-revolutionaries are unfounded. The mass line is a principle that must be followed in any work. The mass line must be followed in suppressing relatively open and exposed counter-revolutionaries, and the mass line must also be followed in eliminating covert counter-revolutionaries. The mass line must be followed in the current movement, and the mass line must also be followed in future regular struggles.

Of course, our emphasis on the need to rely on the masses in the struggle against hidden enemies does not mean that the work of specialized organs is not important, or that it does not need to be strengthened. In the struggle against hidden enemies, the specialized work of public security and security organs must be strengthened. Without this, it will not be possible to effectively deal with cunning enemies, and it will not be possible to identify and discover enemies under special conditions, and to strike the enemy. All public security and security personnel must constantly learn the skills to fight against hidden enemies, and must constantly learn various scientific and technological knowledge, learn production knowledge, and class struggle knowledge required for this struggle, and constantly summarize the experience of the struggle, build a strong team and various scientific and technological equipment. Only when this specialized work is strengthened can the masses' anti-espionage and anti-special agent struggle gain a strong core. However, this specialized work must be strengthened on the basis of organizing and mobilizing the broad masses to actively participate in the struggle.

At present, the exposure of the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people against the enemy. A struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and to eliminate covert counter-revolutionaries has been launched throughout the country, and the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of cadres and the masses in the anti-espionage struggle are rising day by day. As long as we let go of and effectively organize the power of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party and the government, we will surely be able to completely eliminate all hidden enemies.

    对暗藏的反革命分子进行斗争必须放手发动群众
    解放以来，我们国家曾进行了大规模的镇压反革命运动，肃清了一大批公开的和暴露的反革命分子。同时也从厂矿、企业、机关、学校、军队和广大城乡社会中清除了一些暗藏的反革命分子，包括美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团派遣进来和埋伏下来的特务间谍。这对于保卫国家经济建设、保护人民生命财产的安全、巩固人民的政权都起了重大作用。
    但是，公开的暴露的反革命分子还有不小的一批没有肃清，至于暗藏的反革命分子则还远没有肃清。他们隐蔽起来，有的伪装革命，利用我们的麻痹大意，钻进革命阵营以至共产党内。最近揭露的胡风反革命集团，就是一个证明。现在，我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作正在大规模地展开，美帝国主义及其走狗们为了阻挠我国的社会主义事业，正在对我国进行战争威胁，并加紧了反革命的特务间谍活动。国内已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中的反革命分子，则逐步和特务间谍分子相互勾结起来，加紧对人民革命和社会主义事业进行破坏。在农村，敌人利用我们农村工作中的某些弱点和困难，积极进行造谣挑拨，煽动扰乱，进行凶杀暗害的活动。在厂矿企业部门，敌人利用我制度不严，干部技术能力不高，制造着各种破坏事故。钻入我国家机关和共产党内的敌人，则窃取我政治、经济和军事的机密，供给帝国主义。这些情况表明，目前我们同反革命分子的斗争，已经进入了一个更加隐蔽、更加复杂和尖锐的新时期。
    肃清暗藏的反革命分子是保证我国人民民主专政制度的巩固，保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业顺利成功的必要工作，是全党和全国人民的重要任务之一。
    怎样才能肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子呢？几年来的经验告诉我们，要肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，必须依靠领导机关的正确领导和广大群众的高度觉悟相结合才能办到，必须依靠公安保卫机关的专门工作和广大人民群众的积极参加防奸反特斗争相结合才能办到。过去我们在这条战线上所取得的每一胜利，都直接间接取得了人民群众的支持和帮助。人民群众提供了大批的线索和可靠的证据，并协助公安保卫机关破获了许多难以破获的案件。人民群众的这种自觉的行动，使反革命分子没有藏身之地。今后要在这条战线上取得更大的胜利，直至肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，就必须广泛地深入地发动群众，使公安保卫机关的专门工作和广大群众的防奸反特斗争更好地密切结合起来。
    但是，在我们的一些同志中有一种错误的思想，就是认为过去在镇压反革命运动时对付比较公开暴露的反革命分子可以依靠群众，现在对付隐蔽的敌人，只要依靠领导与专门机关就够了，用不着动员广大群众参加。他们借口这一工作有秘密性，怕群众知道，泄露秘密；他们还借口这一斗争的复杂性，怕群众参加后会搞乱或搞错了。在这种错误思想的支配下，我们的某些领导人员对于当前在国家机关、党的组织、人民团体、文化教育机关、经济机关中所进行的肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争，束手束脚，不敢大胆放手地发动群众。他们害怕机关空气紧张，以平时状态布置当前运动，动作迟缓，斗争展不开，有的甚至在群众斗争情绪激昂，尖锐地揭露反革命的言论和行为时，唯恐过火，过早地在大会小会上批判急躁情绪，急忙宣布“纪律”，实质上是给群众泼冷水。有一些单位不去认真地发动群众开展斗争，揭发反革命的言论和行动，企图以司法手段代替群众运动，抓几个反革命分子了事。也有一些单位借口业务忙而不认真开展斗争。在群众没有发动起来的单位，仍有不少反革命分子在运动中进行各种破坏活动，拒不交代，威胁动摇者，阻挠别人坦白，销毁证件，订立“攻守同盟”，反革命分子的嚣张气焰没有被打击下去。另外在我们某些专门机关和人员中存在着神秘化和孤立主义的思想。这种思想表现在他们同暗藏反革命分子的经常斗争中，不去注意教育、组织和发动群众参加这一斗争，看不见群众的力量。许多地方发现了反革命破坏事故，不动员群众协助追查，发现了反革命标语，偷偷擦掉，不敢让群众看见，据说是怕群众看见影响不好。单靠专门机关去侦察许多反革命案件，不去发动群众协助破案。有些已经破获的案件应当向群众宣传的也不去向群众宣传，这样就把群众的眼睛蒙蔽起来，结果反而便利于反革命分子的活动。许多地方和部门对暗藏反革命分子的斗争至今还限于少数领导人员和专门机关在那里孤军作战，斗争的范围很小，不能形成声势浩大的力量。这是暗藏反革命分子没有受到根本性的打击的主要原因。神秘化和孤立主义思想不但妨碍专门机关和群众的结合，也严重地妨碍着各个对敌斗争部门相互配合和统一作战。另外有些人虽然在思想上认为对暗藏反革命分子进行斗争必须依靠群众，但如何依靠群众，如何把专门机关的工作同广大群众的防奸反特斗争结合起来，则缺乏具体的办法，也没有积极的行动，因此他们的群众路线还停留在口头上，而没有在实际工作中得到解决。
    为什么对暗藏反革命分子斗争必须要依靠群众呢？因为暗藏反革命分子特别是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的暗探奸细，是我们国家和人民的最危险的敌人，他们的行动严重地危害着国家和全体人民的利益，如果他们的阴谋得到成功，那就是反革命的复辟，那就要使中国倒退几十年。因此肃清暗藏反革命分子是每个人所应当密切关心的问题，是每个人义不容辞的责任，因此不能把这样一个严重的斗争看作是与多数人无关的少数领导人员和专门人员的事情。大家知道暗藏的反革命分子是无孔不入，无隙不钻的，只要他们发现我们那里有弱点可利用，那里防范不严，那里领导和群众警惕性不高，他们就向那里钻，因此任何一个地方、部门与角落，如果不把群众的警惕性提高起来，不去组织群众的防奸反特工作，就有可能被暗藏敌人钻进来。对于暗藏的反革命分子仅仅依靠少数领导人员和公安机关的眼睛是不够的，必须所有人的眼睛都睁开以后，反革命才没有藏身之地。我们不能因为反革命分子的活动更加隐蔽，这一斗争越来越复杂，而不去依靠群众，相反的，正是因为反革命分子更加隐蔽，斗争更加复杂，因而更加需要依靠群众，更加需要有千百万双眼睛去监视敌人。胡风反革命集团以及其他许多暗藏的反革命分子的被揭露，还不是一个很好的证明吗？还不是证明了只要群众眼睛睁开以后，任何狡猾的反革命分子都难以躲藏吗？须知，反革命分子有时可以瞒过领导，也可以瞒过公安机关，但他们不能瞒过广大干部和所有的人民。这是因为任何一个反革命分子总是要生活在群众之中，任何狡猾的反革命也不是“天衣无缝”的。反革命总是有来历的，总是有可疑的历史的，他既要反革命就会有反革命的活动，既有反革命的活动就会有被发现的可能。过去暗藏的反革命分子没有被彻底揭露出来，倒不完全是因为他们的本领高明，而主要的是因为我们没有把所有的干部和群众发动起来，提高他们的警惕性，使其与暗藏的反革命分子作斗争。因此，今后必须全党动员，全国人民动员，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。人民的力量是伟大的，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，反革命分子最害怕的是群众的发动与群众警惕性的提高。因为群众最知道反革命分子的底细，最能揭露反革命分子的真面目与一切罪行。只要群众发动起来，反革命分子的嚣张气焰就会被打击下去，反革命分子不能不低头。
    群众发动起来后会不会把斗争搞乱与搞错呢，当然搞乱搞错的可能不是完全不存在的，但这个问题不在于群众，而在于领导。搞乱和搞错的地方，经常是领导者不负责任或不积极负责领导的地方。如果领导能够重视肃清暗藏的反革命分子的工作，首长负责，亲自动手，正确执行中央所规定的肃清暗藏反革命分子的政策并依靠群众，总结群众斗争的经验，并以之教育群众，则不会搞乱搞错，反之，如果领导者不负责任或不积极负责，不发动群众或者不充分发动群众与暗藏反革命分子作斗争，并在斗争中经常教育群众，就很有可能发生乱子与错误。经验证明群众发动的越充分，群众的眼睛擦得越亮，就越容易揭露暗藏反革命分子，越能克服麻木不仁和“草木皆兵”的两种偏向，也越能避免乱抓乱捉和“逼、供、信”的错误，越能正确实现“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针。同时群众警惕性越高，就越能保守党和国家的机密，保守与暗藏反革命分子作斗争的机密。借口业务工作太忙而不去发动斗争，把业务工作与肃清暗藏反革命分子对立起来也是不对的，如果不肃清暗藏的反革命分子，业务工作是没有保证做好的。不错，我们各机关的业务工作都很忙，但不能因此不去肃清暗藏的反革命分子，应当把业务与政治工作两者适当地结合起来。我们既要做好业务工作，又要肃清暗藏的反革命分子，一切不去发动群众同暗藏反革命分子作斗争的借口都是没有根据的。群众路线是进行任何工作都必须遵守的原则。镇压比较公开暴露的反革命分子要走群众路线，肃清暗藏的反革命分子也要走群众路线，在当前的运动中要走群众路线，在今后的经常斗争中也必须走群众路线。
    当然，我们强调与隐蔽敌人进行斗争必须依靠群众，并不是说专门机关的工作不重要了，或不需要加强了。与隐蔽的敌人作斗争，必须加强公安、保卫机关的专门工作。不如此，就不能有效地对付狡猾的敌人，不能在特殊的条件之下识别和发现敌人，打中敌人，所有的公安保卫工作人员必须不断学习与隐蔽敌人作斗争的本领，必须不断地学习这种斗争所需要的各种科学技术知识、学习生产知识、阶级斗争知识，不断地总结斗争的经验，建设坚强的队伍和各种科学技术设备。只有这种专门工作加强了，才能使群众的防奸反特斗争获得坚强的核心。但是，这种专门的工作必须在组织和发动广大群众积极参加斗争的基础上来加强。
    目前，由于揭露了胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，激起了广大人民群众对敌人的愤怒。在全国范围内，展开了肃清胡风反革命集团和肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，广大干部和群众反奸斗争的热情和积极性正在日益高涨。只要我们放手发动和有效地组织广大群众的力量，在党和政府的领导下，我们一定能够把一切暗藏的敌人彻底消灭干净。
