Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: New soldiers who enlisted during the recent conscription efforts are making rapid progress under the guidance and assistance of leaders and veteran soldiers at all levels of the People's Liberation Army.

After large numbers of newly enlisted young soldiers were assigned to various units of the People's Liberation Army, Party organizations at all levels of the PLA generally made the work of uniting and educating new soldiers one of their central tasks. They called on staff and veteran soldiers to care for the new soldiers and to set an example for them in work and study. In military training, staff and veteran soldiers actively helped the new soldiers master military techniques. Many veteran soldiers also used their spare time to help the new soldiers study. In a certain naval unit, many veteran soldiers and new soldiers signed a "Unity, Mutual Assistance, and Common Progress" pact. In the Air Force, veteran soldiers also adopted the "mentorship" method, patiently helping the new soldiers learn military techniques. In order to enable the new soldiers to quickly master military technology and military science knowledge, many instructors in the troops improved their teaching methods and created many easy-to-understand teaching aids. In daily life, the staff and veteran soldiers took meticulous care of the new soldiers. They often helped the new soldiers wipe their weapons, tidy up their quarters, and mend their clothes. Some veteran soldiers even gave their beloved study notebooks, pens, tooth mugs, etc., to the new soldiers to encourage them to study hard. Many units also organized report meetings and forums, where staff, veteran soldiers, and heroes and model workers introduced the glorious history of their unit and the deeds of heroes and model figures to the new soldiers. A certain unit also held a history exhibition of the unit, displaying the banners won by the unit in various battles to liberate and defend the motherland, as well as introductions and pictures of the deeds of heroes and model figures. All of these gave the new soldiers great encouragement. The new soldiers expressed that they would study hard and resolutely become excellent national defense soldiers to thank the staff and veteran soldiers for their care, and take practical actions to inherit the glorious traditions of the troops and maintain the honor bought by the blood of martyrs and veteran comrades.

With the help of staff and veteran soldiers and inspired by the honor of the troops, the new soldiers worked hard and diligently, and made rapid progress in all aspects such as military skills and political awareness. Wang Chengjun, a new soldier on a certain naval vessel, often stood on the gun position in strong winds and waves, using the seagulls flying on the sea as targets for practice in order to quickly master maritime aiming techniques. Ji Changyou, Zhang Jingquan, and other new soldiers of an anti-aircraft unit practiced aiming in their dormitories and on their beds when they could not go outdoors due to rain. Now, many new soldiers have initially mastered shooting techniques and achieved "excellent" results in live ammunition shooting. At an award ceremony held in a certain unit, Mi Guiwen and 15 other new soldiers were rewarded for their good performance in work and study. Long Dingsheng, a new soldier in a certain unit, also won the glorious title of special-grade shooter. Wang Zhen, a new soldier and member of the Youth League in a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region, not only had good academic performance himself, but also actively helped other new soldiers learn. He was elected as a representative to attend the Youth League member representative meeting of this unit.

After preliminary military training, a large number of new soldiers have begun to perform guard and combat missions under the leadership of veteran soldiers. On the anti-aircraft artillery positions on the Fujian front, some new soldiers participated in air defense operations under the leadership of veteran soldiers. They showed composure and courage in combat, and were praised by the staff and veteran soldiers. On naval ships, many new sailors are proud and honored to be able to undertake maritime patrol and other tasks. Li Dequan, a gunner on a certain ship, said excitedly: "Now I can also guard the gate for the motherland and stand guard for 600 million people." These young and strong new soldiers have also brought a new atmosphere to the troops, making the life of the troops more active and richer. New soldiers have participated in the amateur drama teams and sports teams of many units, and they have become a new force in the cultural and recreational activities of the troops.

    解放军新战士在老战士的教导下进步很快
    据新华社二十八日讯　在征集补充兵员时应征入伍的新战士，在人民解放军各级领导工作人员和老战士的教导和帮助下，进步很快。
    大批应征入伍的青年战士分配到人民解放军各部队后，人民解放军部队中各级党组织普遍把做好团结、教育新战士的工作列为中心任务之一，号召工作人员和老战士爱护新战士，并在工作和学习中做新战士的表率。在军事训练中，工作人员和老战士积极帮助新战士掌握军事技术，许多老战士还利用自己课余的休息时间来帮助新战士学习。海军某部中许多老战士和新战士订立了“团结互助共同进步”的公约。在空军中，老战士也都采取了“包教”的方法，耐心地帮助新战士学习军事技术。部队中的许多教练员为了让新战士很快地掌握军事技术和军事科学知识，改进了教学方法，创造了许多通俗易懂的教具，在日常生活中，工作人员和老战士对新战士的关怀更是无微不至。他们经常帮助新战士擦拭武器、整理内务、缝补衣物等。有些老战士还把自己心爱的学习本、钢笔、牙缸等送给新战士，鼓励他们努力学习。许多部队还专门组织了报告会、座谈会，由工作人员、老战士和英雄模范向新战士介绍本部队的光荣历史和英雄模范人物事迹。某部并举办了本部队历史展览会，陈列出这支部队在解放祖国和保卫祖国建设的各次战斗中获得的锦旗和涌现的英雄模范人物的事迹介绍和图片。这些，都给新战士极大鼓舞。新战士们纷纷表示：他们要以努力学习，坚决做一个优秀的国防战士，来答谢工作人员和老战士的关怀，并以实际行动继承部队的光荣传统，保持烈士和老同志用鲜血换来的荣誉。
    新战士们在工作人员和老战士的帮助下以及受到部队荣誉的鼓舞，都能勤学苦练，在军事技术和政治觉悟等各方面都有了迅速的提高。海军某艇上的新战士王成俊，为了迅速掌握海上瞄准技术，常常在大风浪中站在炮位上，把飞翔在海面上的海鸥作为目标进行练习。防空部队某部新战士姬长友、张景全等，在下雨天不能到室外去，他们就在宿舍里、床铺上练习瞄准。现在，许多新战士已经初步掌握了射击技术，在实弹射击中得到“优秀”成绩。在某部举行的授奖大会上，米贵文等十五名新战士由于在工作、学习中表现良好受到了奖励。某部新战士龙丁生并且获得了特等射手的光荣称号。新疆军区某部新战士、青年团员王祯，不但自己学习成绩良好，而且积极帮助其他新战士学习，他被推选为出席这个部队的青年团团员代表大会的代表。
    大批新战士在经过初步军事学习后，已经开始在老战士带领下执行警卫和战斗任务。福建前线的高射炮兵阵地上，有些新战士在老战士带领下参加了对空作战。他们在作战时表现沉着、勇敢，受到工作人员和老战士的赞扬。在海军舰艇上，许多新水兵都以能够担负起海上巡逻等任务而感到骄傲和光荣。某舰炮手李德全兴奋地说：“现在我也能为祖国守卫大门，为六亿人民站岗放哨了。”这些年轻、强壮的新战士还给部队带来新的气象，使部队生活更活跃、更丰富了。许多部队的业余演剧队、体育队，都有新战士参加，他们已经成为部队文娱活动的新的力量。
