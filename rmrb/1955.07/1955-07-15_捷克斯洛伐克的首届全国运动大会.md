    Czechoslovakia's First National Games
    Chen Li'ang

    Czechoslovakia held its first National Games in its capital, Prague, from June 23 to July 6. This was part of the celebration of the tenth anniversary of Czechoslovakia's National Day.

    This sports event had extensive mass participation, demonstrating a great organizational force. Since the Czechoslovak State Committee for Physical Culture passed the resolution to hold the games last March, the whole country, under the call of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, launched a vigorous campaign. Whether in factories, rural areas, or government offices and schools, men and women, old and young, plunged into this movement in their tens of thousands. About 760,000 athletes participated in the sports meets held in various counties across the country, and about 390,000 athletes participated in the sports meets held in various states across the country. From these sports meets, there were selections of representatives of 120,000 young people and more than 130,000 adults. In addition to these representatives, tens of thousands of people, including athletes from the armed forces and other athletes, participated in the National Games. These Czechs, Slovaks, and other ethnic minorities from all over the country and all walks of life performed 28 kinds of group performances, such as gymnastics, during the conference. Each performance involved as many as tens of thousands of people, and as few as hundreds of people. More than 500,000 person-times participated in these performances in eight days. From beginning to end, the movements were agile, neat, and beautiful. It can be said that no one's practice did not match the beautiful music rhythm and pattern-like pictures, even when it rained heavily on July 3. All of these demonstrated a high level of practice, unity, and organization. The track and field competitions, various ball games, water sports competitions, and car races held before and during the conference demonstrated an increasing level of skill, and new records were created in many aspects.

    The mass character of the sports event can also be seen from the enthusiastic participation of the audience. During the eight days, a total of 1.49 million people watched the performances of youth and adult gymnastics at the main venue of the conference - the Strahov Stadium in Prague. In addition, the number of people watching track and field, ball games, water sports competitions, car races, and folk song and dance troupe performances has not yet been calculated. When viewed in connection with the national population figure of Czechoslovakia - 13 million - people can fully understand the broad mass character displayed by the above-mentioned figures of athletes and audiences, as well as the high degree of organizational ability required to ensure the supply and transportation for this large-scale work.

    This sports event also demonstrated the high level of sports movement of the Czechoslovak people. Whether it was the sports representatives of the fraternal countries of the socialist camp or the guests from capitalist countries, they unanimously praised this point. N. Romanov, Chairman of the Sports Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, gave a very appropriate evaluation. After watching the gymnastics performance of nearly 10,000 labor reserve students, he said: This is an unparalleled and excellent performance. These gymnastics attract the audience and attract them from beginning to end. The sports trainers who created these gymnastics made the best use of the achievements of sports in this regard. The conference showed that Czechoslovakia's sports movement is developing on a very broad mass basis. People from capitalist countries also admired the achievements of the sports event. Stanley Clark, Deputy President of Reuters, said after watching the conference performance: "I have never seen such a performance before. The great success of the performance should be attributed not only to its organizers but also to the hundreds of thousands of young people who participated."

    This conference was also a major exchange of sports movement experience among various countries, especially the socialist camp countries. A total of sports and cultural figures from 35 countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas (according to incomplete statistics) came to participate in the conference. The Soviet Union, China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Mongolia also sent sports teams to participate in the performance. These performances were all very exciting and had their own unique features, providing good opportunities for mutual learning among countries. In particular, the performances of the Soviet athletes became a model for everyone to learn from. The performance of our country's gymnastics team of more than 150 people was also warmly welcomed. The audience constantly gave stormy applause during the performance. After the performance, the audience came to shake hands and asked for autographs as souvenirs. The leaders of the Czechoslovak party and government and the diplomatic envoys of various fraternal countries congratulated Cao Ying, our ambassador to Czechoslovakia, on the success of the Chinese sports team.

    Today's great achievements in Czechoslovakia's sports movement have been achieved under the care of the party and the people's democratic government. The people of Czechoslovakia have always loved sports. However, before liberation, the people were often threatened by unemployment, bankruptcy, and starvation. Physical activities that were beneficial to their physical and mental health could not be well carried out among the people. Sports movement became a means for a few people to seek profit or leisure to a considerable extent. Only after liberation and under the people's democratic regime, did the people's sports movement gradually develop extensively. In 1953, the Czechoslovak National Assembly approved an allocation of 144 million crowns for sports undertakings, which was almost twice as much as the allocation in 1950. In terms of sports equipment, at the end of the war in 1945, there were only 100 tracks and one artificial ice winter sports field in the country. Under the people's regime, during the Five-Year Plan alone, 150 football fields, 150 outdoor swimming pools, 50 gymnasiums, 11 skating rinks, 30 ski jumping platforms, 4 indoor swimming pools, and about 1,000 sports fields were newly built. In order to ensure the wide development of sports among the people, the sports exercise system of "Labor Defense of the Motherland" was also implemented, which was divided into different levels according to people's age and gender. These included: walking, running, jumping, throwing, swimming, cycling, skiing, gymnastics, shooting, first aid, and general sports knowledge. By the end of last year, there were more than 1.25 million people participating in voluntary sports associations (31% of whom were women), which means that one out of every ten people in the country was a member. Since the implementation of the "Labor Defense of the Motherland" system, by the end of last year, 280,000 athletes, that is, one out of every four or five members of the association, had won the "Labor Defense of the Motherland" medal.

    On the basis of such extensive development of mass sports movement, Czechoslovak athletes have won more and more honors in international competitions. From 1900 to 1936, in the ten Olympic World Games, Czechoslovak athletes won a total of only four gold, seven silver, and four bronze medals. However, in the 15th Olympic World Games in Helsinki in 1952, Czechoslovak athletes won seven gold, three silver, and three bronze medals. In 1954 alone, Czechoslovak athletes broke seven world and European records and 181 national records. Long-distance runner Zatopek broke the world record for 10,000 meters with a score of 28 minutes and 54.2 seconds. Race walker Dolezel broke the world record for 15 kilometers with a score of 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 6 seconds, and also broke the world record for 10 miles with a score of 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 45.8 seconds. Skobla won the European championship in shot put, and Mrs. Zatopek won the European championship in javelin. In addition, in 1954, in the World Rowing Championships held in France, Vaknel won the first place in the 10,000-meter single sculls. In the World Gymnastics Championships held in Rome, Bosakova won the second place in the individual all-around. In the World Table Tennis Championships held in London, Andriadis, together with a Hungarian player, won the doubles championship. In the European Women's Basketball Championships held in Belgrade, the Czechoslovak team won the second place. Outstanding achievements have also been made in other aspects, such as ice hockey, skating, football, and car racing.

    In the past ten years, Czechoslovakia's socialist construction has achieved great achievements. On this basis, the people's living standards have been greatly improved, and the sports movement has also gained strong development. After further and powerful mobilization by this sports event, Czechoslovakia's sports movement will definitely develop more rapidly in the future and make greater contributions to peace and socialist construction.

    捷克斯洛伐克的首届全国运动大会
    陈理昂
    捷克斯洛伐克从六月二十三日到七月六日在首都布拉格举行了第一届全国运动大会，这是捷克斯洛伐克国庆十周年庆祝活动的一部分。
    这次运动大会具有广泛的群众性，表现了巨大的组织力量。从去年三月捷克斯洛伐克国家体育运动委员会通过举行这次大会的决议起，全国在捷共和政府的号召下展开了轰轰烈烈的运动。无论在工厂、农村或机关、学校，无论男女老少，成千成万地投入了这一运动。约七十六万运动员参加了全国各县举行的运动会，约三十九万运动员参加了全国各州举行的运动会。从这些运动会选拔出的代表有十二万青少年和十三万多成年人。参加全国运动大会的除这些代表外，还有武装部队运动员及其他运动员等数万人。这些来自全国各地各阶层的捷克人、斯洛伐克人和其他少数民族的人，在大会中进行了体操等二十八种集体表演。每次表演多至数万人，少至数百人，八天中参加这些表演的共计五十多万人次。自始至终，动作敏捷，整齐优美，可以说没有一人的操练不合美妙的音乐节奏和图案似的画面，甚至七月三日下大雨时也是如此。所有这些表现了高度的操练水平、团结一致和组织性。在会前和会中举行的田径赛、各种球赛、水上运动比赛、车赛都表现了日益增长的技巧水平，而且在不少方面又创造了新的纪录。
    运动会的群众性还可以从观众的踊跃情形看出。八天中到大会主要会场——布拉格斯特拉霍夫运动场观看青少年和成年集体操等表演的共计一百四十九万人次，此外观看田径、球赛、水上运动比赛、车赛和民间歌舞团会演的尚未计算在内。观众不仅是布拉格及其附近的居民，而且有成万从全国各地特地赶来的观众以及为着运动会特地回国的国外捷侨约三千人。同捷克斯洛伐克全国人口数字——一千三百万联系起来看，人们才能充分了解上述运动员和观众数字所显示的广泛群众性，以及为大会保证供应和交通这个巨大规模工作所要求的高度组织能力。
    这次运动大会也表现了捷克斯洛伐克人民高度的体育运动水平，无论是社会主义阵营兄弟国家的体育代表还是从资本主义国家来的客人，对这点都异口同声地称赞不绝。苏联部长会议体育运动委员会主席尼·罗马诺夫给了一个极恰当的评价。他在观看近一万名劳动后备学生的集体操后说：这是无与伦比的绝佳的表演。这些体操吸引着观众，自始至终吸引着他们。创造这些体操的体育训练工作者最好地利用了体育在这方面的成就。大会显示捷克斯洛伐克的体育运动正在很广泛的群众基础上发展。来自资本主义国家的人们也钦佩运动会的成就。路透社副社长斯坦莱·克拉克观看大会表演后说：“我以前从来没有看过这样的表演。表演的巨大成功不仅要归功于其组织者而且要归功于参加的数十万青年人。”
    这次大会也是各国，特别是社会主义阵营各国体育运动经验的大交流。前来参加大会的总共有欧亚美三大洲三十五个国家（据不完全统计）的体育文化界人士。苏联、中国、波兰、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、蒙古还派有体育队参加表演。这些表演都十分精采而且各有独到之处，为各国彼此学习提供了良好的机会，尤其是苏联运动员的表演更成了大家学习的榜样。我国一百五十多人的体操队的表演也受到极热烈的欢迎。表演中观众不断报以暴风雨般的鼓掌。表演后观众纷纷前来握手要求签名留念。捷克斯洛伐克党和政府的领袖和各兄弟国家外交使节纷纷向我驻捷大使曹瑛祝贺中国体育队的成功。
    今天捷克斯洛伐克体育运动的巨大成就是在党和人民民主的政府的关怀下才获得的。捷克斯洛伐克人民一向爱好体育运动。但是解放前，人民经常处于失业、破产、饥饿的威胁中，有益身心健康的体育活动不能在人民中间很好地开展，体育运动在相当程度上成为少数人谋利或消闲的手段。只是在解放后在人民民主政权下，人民体育运动才逐步广泛地开展起来。一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克国民议会批准对体育事业的拨款达一亿四千四百万克朗，差不多比一九五○年的拨款多一倍。在运动设备方面，大战结束时的一九四五年，全国仅有跑道一百条和一个人造冰的冬季运动场。在人民政权下，仅在五年计划中，就新建了一百五十个足球场，一百五十个露天游泳池，五十个体育馆，十一个溜冰场，三十个滑雪跳板，四个室内游泳池，约一千个运动场。为了保证体育运动在人民中间广泛开展，还实行了“劳动卫国”的体育锻炼制度，按人们年龄及性别而分成不同的级别。其中包括：走、跑、跳、掷、游泳、自行车、滑雪、体操、射击、急救及一般体育知识等项目。到去年底全国参加自愿体育运动协会的有一百二十五万多人（其中百分之三十一是妇女），即是说全国每十人中即有一个会员。而从“劳动卫国”制实行以来到去年底已有二十八万名运动员即协会会员中每四、五人即有一人已获得“劳动卫国”奖章。
    在这样广泛地发展群众体育运动的基础上，捷克斯洛伐克的运动员在国际比赛中获得愈来愈多的荣誉。从一九○○年到一九三六年在十次奥林匹克世界运动大会上，捷克斯洛伐克运动员一共只获得四枚金质、七枚银质和四枚铜质奖章。但在一九五二年赫尔辛基第十五届奥林匹克世界运动大会上，捷克斯洛伐克运动员便得到七枚金质、三枚银质和三枚铜质奖章。仅在一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克运动员就打破了七个世界和欧洲纪录、一百八十一个全国纪录。长跑健将查托皮克打破一万公尺世界纪录，成绩二十八分五十四秒二。竞走健将多勒热尔打破十五公里世界纪录，成绩一小时五分六秒，还打破十英里世界纪录，成绩一小时十分四十五秒八。斯科布拉荣获铅球欧洲冠军，查托皮克夫人荣获镖枪欧洲冠军。此外，在一九五四年中，在法国举行的世界划船冠军赛中，沃克涅尔得一万公尺单划第一名。在罗马举行的世界体操冠军赛中，波萨科娃得个人全能第二名，在伦敦举行的乒乓球世界冠军赛中，安德里亚迪斯会同匈牙利选手获得双打冠军，在贝尔格莱德举行的欧洲女子篮球冠军赛中，捷克斯洛伐克队得到第二名。其他方面，如冰球、溜冰、足球、车赛方面也获得了杰出的成绩。
    十年来，捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设得到了很大的成就，在这个基础上，人民的生活水平大大提高，体育运动也获得了强大的发展。经过这次运动大会的进一步有力的动员，今后捷克斯洛伐克体育运动必将更迅速地发展，为和平和社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。（布拉格航寄）
