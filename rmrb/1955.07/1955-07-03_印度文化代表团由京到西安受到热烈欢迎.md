　　Indian Cultural Delegation Warmly Welcomed in Xi'an After Arrival from Beijing

　　(Our report) The Indian Cultural Delegation concluded its visit and performances in Beijing and, accompanied by Zhou Weizhi, Deputy Director of the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, and Ramu, Administrative Commissioner of the Indian Embassy in China, left Beijing by plane on the morning of the 2nd to visit and perform in various places.

　　More than 1,000 people from the capital went to the airport to see them off.

　　During their stay in Beijing, the distinguished guests visited some factories, universities, places of interest, museums, and exhibitions, and also watched Chinese song and dance performances. They were reluctant to leave. Mr. Apunni Vasudo Karta, a performer and dancer from the Small Ballet Troupe, said before boarding the plane: "We don't want to leave this city, but we have a lot of work ahead, so we have to leave. Here, we saw the art of the real people. We deeply love the Chinese people. Ms. Shamishta Badan from our troupe has never written poetry before, but this time she came to China and saw many new things, and she was very moved. She wrote two poems in her illness praising Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. From this alone, you can see how much we love the people of New China."

　　As the plane was about to take off, people shook hands tightly once again to say goodbye. Mr. Gyan Sharma gave the flowers given to him by Chinese children, one by one, to his Chinese friends who came to see him off.

　　Mr. Chanda stood at the hatch for a long time after boarding the plane, waving goodbye to the crowd seeing them off.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 2nd. The Indian Cultural Delegation, headed by Chanda, arrived in Xi'an by plane in the rain today.

　　More than 500 literary and art workers in Xi'an waited in the heavy rain for four hours, starting from 9:00 a.m.

　　When the plane carrying the distinguished guests landed, the welcomers applauded and waved flowers, wading through the mud, and crowded towards the plane.

　　After Chairman Chanda and his wife got off the plane, they accepted flowers from two child actors from the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe.

　　Xi'an Mayor Fang Zhongru, Deputy Mayor Zhang Fengbo, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Culture Bureau Yu Xun, Director of the Xi'an Municipal Culture Bureau Hu Cai and others shook hands with the distinguished guests one by one, expressing a warm welcome; they also used their raincoats and umbrellas to shield the distinguished guests from the rain.

　　At the airport, all the distinguished guests also received flowers from the welcomers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 2nd. The head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Chanda, and other leaders of the delegation paid a visit to Zhao Boping, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, and Fang Zhongru, Mayor of Xi'an, at 5:30 this afternoon. During the visit, both the host and guests had a lively conversation about Xuanzang's tomb and other cultural relics and historic sites related to Chinese-Indian culture in the Xi'an area.

　　After the visit, Chairman Chanda and all members of the delegation visited the city of Xi'an separately, and were warmly welcomed by citizens and children along the way. People waved to the cars carrying the guests.

　　At 8:00 p.m. that evening, all members of the Indian Cultural Delegation attended a song and dance reception hosted by the Shaanxi Provincial Culture Bureau. At the reception, the guests first heard the newly composed chorus song "Welcome to the Indian Cultural Delegation" by the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe, and enjoyed wonderful programs such as Qinghai folk songs, Northern Shaanxi folk songs, and Tibetan dances performed by Xi'an literary and art workers.

    本报讯　印度文化代表团结束了在北京的访问演出，由文化部艺术事业管理局副局长周巍峙和印度驻我国大使馆行政专员拉穆陪同，在二日晨乘飞机离开北京去各地访问和演出。
    首都有一千多人到机场欢送。
    贵宾们在北京停留的这一段时间里，参观和访问了一些工厂、大学、名胜、博物馆、展览会，还观看了中国的歌舞演出。他们依依不舍离去。小巴蕾舞剧团演出者兼舞蹈家阿普尼·瓦苏多·卡尔塔先生在临上飞机时说：“我们不想离开这个城市，但前面有许多工作，我们不能不离开。在这里，我们看到了真正人民的艺术。我们深深地热爱中国人民。我们剧团的沙米什塔·巴丹女士她从没写过诗，但这次到中国，看了许多新东西，她很感动。她在病中写了两首歌颂毛主席和中国人民的诗。光从这一点你就可看出我们是如何热爱新中国的人民了。”
    飞机就要起飞了，人们再一次紧紧地握手告别。吉安·夏尔马先生把我国儿童送给他的花，一朵一朵分送给欢送他的中国朋友。
