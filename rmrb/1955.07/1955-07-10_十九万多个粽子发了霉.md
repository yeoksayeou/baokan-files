    More Than 190,000 Zongzi Have Gone Moldy
    To the Editor:
    The Harbin No. 1 Food Production Cooperative started producing zongzi on a large scale from June 14th (ten days before the Dragon Boat Festival).

    Before long, people could smell a strong, sour, rotten odor emanating from the cooperative from afar. Upon closer inspection, the cooperative was full of moldy zongzi in the houses and courtyard, with flies swarming over them.

    How many zongzi were spoiled? By June 23rd (the day before the festival), the total was 190,375, weighing 9,518.75 jin of Jiangmi (glutinous rice). Another 50,000 needed to be re-cooked to determine if they were still good.

    The director of the cooperative calmly told the inspectors from the grain and sanitation departments: "These moldy zongzi can be sold for making yellow wine, syrup, or vinegar. After the zongzi leaves are cleaned by hand, they can still be sold for making zongzi." And he really did it. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, he personally led the workers, pushing carts to the market, shouting about big price reductions, and retailed some of them for one fen each. In addition, he sold some to those who make wine, vinegar, and syrup for one jiao for twenty; and he sold a box for five jiao to someone nearby to use as pig feed.

    Why did the Harbin No. 1 Food Production Cooperative blindly produce these zongzi? An investigation should be conducted.

### 十九万多个粽子发了霉

    十九万多个粽子发了霉编辑同志：
    哈尔滨市第一食品生产合作社从六月十四日（端午节前十天）就大规模地生产粽子。
    不几天，人们远远地就能闻到从该社发散出来的一股浓厚的腐酸味。走近一看，只见该社满屋子满院子都晾着发霉的粽子，苍蝇在上面盘旋。
    究竟坏了多少粽子呢？到二十三日（节前一天）那天止，共是十九万零三百七十五个，计九千五百十八斤七两五江米。另有五万个要回锅重煮以后才能确定好坏。
    合作社主任曾经很泰然地对粮食部门和卫生部门的检查人员说：“这批发霉的粽子可以卖给做黄酒、做糖稀、做醋的使用，粽叶用人工扒洗以后，还可卖给做粽子的。”真的他这样做了。在端午节这天，他亲自率领了工人们推着小车到市场上高喊大减价，以一分钱一个零售了一部分。此外，他以一角钱二十个卖给了做酒、醋、糖稀的一部分；以五角钱一箱卖给了附近某人做猪食。
    哈尔滨市第一食品生产合作社为什么盲目生产这些粽子？应该进行检查。
