Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 13th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser issued a joint statement on the 12th after holding talks in Cairo.

    The statement first reviewed the previous talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Egypt held in Cairo, New Delhi, and Bandung. The statement said that these talks "involved many issues of common concern to both countries and larger issues of international concern. In particular, they are concerned with maintaining peace and granting freedom to those regions that are still in a state of dependency or under colonial rule."
    The statement then mentioned the declaration on world peace and cooperation adopted at the Asian-African Conference. "The two Prime Ministers believe that this declaration is of great significance and that it should guide international relations."
    The two Prime Ministers again discussed international developments, the situation in the Middle East, and other issues of common concern to both countries. The statement said: "The two Prime Ministers wish to reiterate their firm belief in the urgent need to promote the cause of world peace and ease the tensions that exist in various parts of the world. To this end, they firmly believe that participation in military agreements or alliances concluded with major powers does not contribute to the cause of peace and, in fact, often has the opposite effect. The cause of peace can only be further strengthened by peaceful means, and not by any steps that would make any other country feel uneasy. Only through friendly contact and by establishing a sense of security can the fear and suspicion that unfortunately exist in the world today be eliminated. In this regard, universal disarmament and the prohibition of the production and use of nuclear weapons are of fundamental importance."
    The statement said, "The two Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction that the international situation has improved somewhat in recent months, and some steps have been taken to ease tensions. However, serious problems remain, and the situation in some parts of the world is still fraught with danger. This requires constant vigilance by all countries and attempts to avoid mutual recrimination and any steps that might hinder the peaceful atmosphere being sought."
    The statement said that the two Prime Ministers sincerely hope that the upcoming Geneva Four-Power Summit will avoid the danger of modern war and lay the foundation for world peace and security. They are further convinced that the upcoming conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy will promote the purpose of convening the conference and will give special attention to the needs of vast regions of Africa and Asia in this regard.

    印埃两国总理在开罗会谈后发表联合声明
    新华社新德里十三日电　印度总理尼赫鲁和埃及总理纳赛尔在开罗举行了会谈以后，十二日发表了联合声明。
    声明首先回顾了印度和埃及两国总理在这以前在开罗、新德里和万隆举行的会谈。声明说，这些会谈“涉及了同两国共同有关的许多问题和国际上关心和关切的较大的问题。特别是，他们关心维护和平和给予目前仍然处于附属国地位或在殖民统治下的这种地区以自由。”
    声明接着提到了在亚非会议上通过的关于世界和平和合作的宣言。“两国总理认为，这个宣言具有重大意义，它应该指导国际关系。”
    两国总理这一次又讨论了国际发展、中东局势和其他对两国共同有关的问题。声明说：“两国总理愿意重申他们坚信迫切需要促进世界和平事业和缓和世界各个部分存在的紧张局势。为此目的，他们坚信，参加同大国缔结的军事协定或联盟并不会有助于和平事业，事实上，往往得到相反的效果。只有用和平方法才能够进一步加强和平事业，而不是用将使任何其他国家感到不安的任何步骤。只有通过友好接触和通过建立一种安全感，今日世界上不幸存在的恐惧和怀疑才能消除。在这方面，普遍裁军和禁止生产和使用核子武器具有基本的重要性。”
    声明说，“两国总理满意地注意到，近几个月来，国际局势已经有了某些改善，一些有助于缓和紧张局势的步骤已经采取。然而，严重的问题依然存在，世界某些部分的局势还充满了危险。这就需要各国经常保持警惕，并试图避免互相攻讦，避免可能会妨害设法建立的和平气氛的任何步骤。”
    声明说，两国总理诚挚地希望：即将来到的日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议将使现代战争的危险得以避免，并且打下世界和平和安全的基础。他们进一步确信，即将来到的和平利用原子能的会议将促进召开这个会议的目的，并且将对于非洲和亚洲的广大地区在这一方面的需要给予特别的注意。
