    Promoting the "Sewn Upper, Lasted" Operation Method
    Wang Ruxing
    The advanced experience of the "sewn upper, lasted" method has been promoted in many rubber shoe factories, achieving considerable results. In April of this year, 19 private rubber shoe factories in Shenyang promoted the "sewn upper, lasted" operation method, saving four tons of raw rubber. The "sewn upper, lasted" operation method was successfully researched and developed by the Shanghai Jin’gang Rubber Factory. According to statistics, using this method to produce rubber shoes can save 13 kilograms of raw rubber, 19.8 kilograms of gasoline, and 20.5 square meters of shoe upper fabric per thousand pairs of shoes, while production efficiency is increased by more than 60 percent. At the same time, it overcomes the shortcomings of uneven shoe soles and avoids industrial injuries such as workers piercing their fingers and spraining their wrist joints.

    The difference between the "sewn upper, lasted" operation method and the old operation method is as follows: First, the "sewn upper, lasted" operation method uses a sewing machine to sew the shoe upper and the bottom fabric together. This saves a circle of fabric for the upper foot compared to the past method of manually wrapping the last and attaching the bottom fabric. Second, it simplifies the lasting operation. In the past, the shoe upper was wrapped around the last by hand, requiring the use of tools such as pliers, scissors, and rolling hammers, resulting in low production efficiency and high labor intensity. The new method is to directly slip the shoe upper, after it has been sewn to the bottom fabric, onto the last, which saves many tools, reduces the labor intensity of workers, and increases production efficiency. Third, in the past operation method, before pasting the sponge insole, a filler was needed to make the shoe sole flat. By adopting the sewn upper operation method, the sponge insole can be directly pasted onto the lasted shoe bottom fabric, thus saving fabric and adhesive.

    The problems that need attention when adopting the "sewn upper, lasted" operation method are: First, the size of the lasts for the same number of shoes should not differ too much, otherwise the quality will be affected. Second, after lasting, the laces should be threaded and knotted inside the shoe buckle, otherwise the shoe upper will easily loosen.

### 推广“缝帮套楦”操作法

    推广“缝帮套楦”操作法
    王汝兴
    “缝帮套楦”的先进经验，已在许多胶鞋工厂推行，取得不少成绩。今年四月，沈阳市十九家私营胶鞋厂推行“缝帮套楦”操作法后，节省了四吨生胶。“缝帮套楦”操作法是上海金刚橡胶厂研究成功的。据统计，用这种方法生产胶鞋，每千双胶鞋可节约生胶十三公斤，汽油十九点八公斤，鞋面布二十点五平方公尺，生产效率提高了百分之六十以上。同时克服了鞋底凸凹不平的缺点，还避免了工人戳破手指和手腕关节扭筋等工伤事故。
    “缝帮套楦”操作法和旧操作方法不同之处是：一、“缝帮套楦”操作法是先用缝纫机把鞋帮和底布缝在一起，这样就比过去用人工包楦贴合底布的方法省去了帮脚一圈布料。二、简化了套楦的操作手续。过去是用手把鞋帮包在鞋楦上，需要使用钳子、剪子、滚锤等工具，生产效率低而且劳动强度大。新方法是把鞋帮和底布缝合好后，就可直接套在鞋楦上，既省去了很多种工具，又可减低工人的劳动强度，也提高生产效率。三、过去的操作法在粘贴海绵中底前，为了使鞋底平整，需要先填上一个填底，采用缝帮的操作法，就可以直接把海绵中底贴在套好楦的鞋底布上，因而节省了布料和胶浆子。
    采用“缝帮套楦”操作法需要注意的问题是：一、同一号码的鞋楦，大小不能相差过大，否则就要影响质量，二、套楦后要在鞋扣内穿带打结，否则鞋帮容易松开。
