　　Shenyang Daily Social Services Group's Investigation

　　The situation revealed by Comrade Cai Zhaocai has been confirmed by our investigation. In the open-air warehouse of the Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, which covers an area of about 2,000 square meters, the value of the accumulated machinery far exceeds the one million yuan reported by the reader. It is difficult to accurately calculate the specific figure for the time being. Among the accumulated machinery, some are materials left over from the enemy and puppet regimes, some are machines dismantled due to changes in production conditions, and some are new machines purchased but not used. Due to poor storage, some machines have rotted into scrap iron, and some have developed thick rust. If they are not dealt with in time, they will become unusable.

　　In 1953, the factory conducted a disposal of stagnant materials, but it passed like a gust of wind. After the reader's critical letter was published in the newspaper in 1953, the factory only painted some of the machines with oil and did not take other active measures; a few months later, the oil had fallen off, and the machines continued to rust.

　　The leading staff of this factory believe that accumulated materials are difficult to handle. In fact, many machines, such as transformers, washing machines, steam pumps, and complete sets of new boilers, are completely usable, and some are very much needed by other units. In order to improve storage conditions and properly store a batch of useful machines, workers have repeatedly suggested building a simple mat shed to improve storage conditions, but the factory believes that it costs too much and refuses to approve it. According to our on-site understanding, there is an idle mat shed of several hundred square meters near the open-air warehouse, which can be fully utilized. Just move the machines to this mat shed.

　　The factory also does not have a special department responsible for the storage of machinery, and several departments shirk responsibility to each other. Idle equipment is fixed assets and is kept on the books by the accounting department. In fact, the accounting department can only keep the books and has no capacity to store them. The factory leadership still instructs the materials department to be responsible for storage. The materials department only sends a storekeeper to look after them. They believe that storage work is not within the business scope of the materials department and request that it be handed over to the equipment and power department. The equipment and power department emphasizes that they lack manpower and are unfamiliar with the business, and are also unwilling to manage it. This unclear division of labor and everyone pushing each other is one of the reasons why the problem has not been completely resolved for several years.

### 沈阳日报社会服务组的调查

　  沈阳日报社会服务组的调查
    蔡照才同志揭发的情况，经我们调查是确实的。在东北制药总厂这个面积约两千平方公尺的露天仓库里积压的机器，价值远远超过读者所反映的一百万元，具体数字一时不易统计清楚。积压的机器中，有一部分是敌伪时遗留下来的物资，有的是因生产情况改变而拆下来的机器，还有一些是买来未用的新机器。由于保管不善，有的机器已经烂成废铁，有的已经生了很厚的锈，如再不及时处理也就不能使用了。
    一九五三年厂里进行过一次呆滞物资的处理工作，但不过是像一阵风似地过去了。一九五三年报纸上发表了读者的批评信后，厂里只是把部分机器涂上了油，并没有采取其它积极措施；几个月以后油都掉了，机器依然继续生锈。
    这个厂的领导工作人员认为积压物资不好处理。事实上有不少机器，如变压器、洗布机、汽泵和全套的新锅炉等是完全能用的，有的是其它单位很需要的。为了改善保管情况，把一批有用的机器保管好，工人们曾一再建议搭一个简易席棚，改善保管情况，但是厂方却认为花钱太多，不予批准。据我们到现场了解，在露天仓库附近就有一座几百平方公尺的席棚闲着，完全可供利用。只要把机器运到这个席棚里就行了。
    厂里对机器的保管也没有一个专门的部门负责，几个部门互相推诿。闲置设备是固定资产，由会计科上账保管。实际上会计科只能记个账，无力保管。厂领导方面仍责成材料科负责保管。材料科只是派一名保管员去看管，他们认为保管工作不属材料科的业务范围，要求交给设备动力科。设备动力科强调人力、业务不熟悉，也不愿意管。这样分工不明，大家推来推去，也是问题几年来不能彻底解决的原因之一。
