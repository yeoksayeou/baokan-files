    The Japanese People Oppose the Establishment of U.S. Military Bases in Japan

    After the United States and Japan concluded the so-called San Francisco "Peace Treaty," formally ending the occupation, the United States, through the so-called "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," continued to station troops in Japan and establish military bases without restriction, effectively keeping Japan under U.S. military occupation. To date, U.S. military authorities have established approximately 800 military facilities in Japan, including army, navy, and air force bases, radar bases, military training grounds, and barracks, spread throughout Japan.

    Currently, the United States is expanding its military bases in Japan. Fukushima Shintaro, Director-General of the Japan Procurement Agency, told the Senate Budget Committee that the U.S. military requested the Japanese government to provide an additional 377,300 acres of land to expand military training grounds and air force bases. Recently, U.S. Far East Air Force Vice Commander Major General McNaughton told American journalists visiting Tokyo that one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. Far East Air Force was obtaining land in Japan to expand runways needed to accommodate modern jet aircraft. According to Japanese newspapers, the United States is expanding its military base network in Japan with Mount Fuji as its center. The expansion of air force bases such as Tachikawa, Komaki, Yokota, Kisarazu, and Niigata is being accelerated to accommodate the take-off and landing of large jet aircraft (B-47, B-52) carrying atomic bombs. Military roads connecting the surrounding bases with Mount Fuji as the center are also under construction.

    The establishment of U.S. military bases in Japan not only threatens the security of Asian countries but also, first and foremost, subjects the Japanese people to deep suffering and humiliation. The Japanese economy is severely affected, especially the farmers. The U.S. military bases in Japan occupy an area of approximately 200,000 hectares, exceeding two-hundredths of Japan's land area, with an average of one base or military facility for every less than 500 square kilometers. In these lands, thousands of residents are forced to leave their homes. Japanese agricultural production is therefore severely damaged, grain production is reduced, and farmers' lives become more impoverished. From Hokkaido to the Kyushu coastline, U.S. naval training grounds occupy 48,000 square kilometers of fishing grounds, causing more than 200,000 fishermen throughout Japan to lose 250,000 tons of fish annually. Moreover, U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan enjoy extraterritorial rights, running rampant, behaving atrociously, and insulting the national feelings and dignity of the Japanese people in the base areas. According to Kyodo News, from October 1953 to the end of August 1954, there were 5,000 criminal cases involving murder, robbery, and rape committed by Americans, averaging 500 cases per month. U.S. military bases have also become dens of decadence and immorality. An American military chaplain revealed that among the 5,000 residents of the U.S. Air Force Base in Misawa, Japan alone, there were 1,200 prostitutes. In addition, due to frequent U.S. military exercises, the constant noise of aircraft and artillery fire disrupts the peace of residents everywhere. According to the lowest estimates, about 70 schools are completely unable to hold classes as a result. As early as July 1954, an article published in the Japanese "Industrial Labor Newspaper" entitled "No Good Days Since the Americans Came" pointed out that the damage caused by U.S. military bases to the interests of the Japanese people "is no longer a question of reduced harvest or reduced income, but has reached a critical point of survival."

    More and more Japanese people are realizing that the establishment of U.S. military bases and the stationing of troops in Japan keep Japan in a state of being occupied and harmed, and put Japan at risk of being drawn into new wars. In order to safeguard national dignity, protect their lives, and strive for peace and independence, the Japanese people have continuously waged struggles against the establishment of U.S. military bases. The vast number of farmers, workers, social organizations, and representatives of political parties have participated in this struggle. The form of struggle began with petitions to the Diet and the expression of opinions in newspapers and periodicals, followed by mass rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and even gatherings to prevent U.S. troops from occupying farmland as bases. In 1953, a world-shaking event occurred in Uchinada Village, Ishikawa Prefecture. For a long time, the residents of Uchinada Village waged a heroic resistance against the U.S. military's opening of an artillery firing range on their land. This struggle quickly developed into a nationwide movement.

    In recent months, due to the U.S. plot to expand its military bases in Japan, the Japanese people's movement against U.S. military bases has become even more vigorous. After the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee announced plans to expand the military base at the foot of Mount Fuji on March 9th of this year, the Japanese people immediately rose up to carry out organized struggles. First, Fujiyoshida City and Yamanashi Prefecture, led by the mayor and prefectural governor, successively convened representative meetings and mass rallies. They firmly opposed the U.S. military's expansion of military bases, demanded that the U.S. military return its military training grounds at the foot of Mount Fuji to Japan, and established an organization to lead this movement—the Alliance for the Return of the North Fuji Training Grounds. Many residents near Mount Fuji demonstrated around the U.S. military firing ranges, opposing U.S. live-fire exercises, and, disregarding the danger to their lives, broke through the U.S. military's firing range forbidden zone and held sit-in protests near U.S. artillery mounts and in the impact area.

    This just struggle of the residents in the Mount Fuji area quickly set off a new wave of opposition to U.S. military bases throughout the country. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with three million members, announced that more than ten national trade union organizations, including railway and electricity unions, had decided to send representatives to participate in this struggle. The Left-wing Socialist Party Diet Countermeasures Committee decided to launch a movement against the United States maintaining and expanding military bases in Japan. Right-wing Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives, Tahara Haruji, raised an urgent interpellation to the government at a House of Representatives meeting regarding the U.S. military's shelling of Mount Fuji. Many Japanese Diet members demanded amendments to the agreement allowing U.S. military firing exercises. When the residents of the Mount Fuji area opposed the U.S. military firing exercises, the Japanese electricity, railway, and other trade union organizations sent one hundred representatives to the foot of Mount Fuji to sit near the U.S. military artillery mounts all night, preventing the U.S. military from firing. Deputy Chairman Kamiyama of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan went to Yamanashi Prefecture to support the struggle of the residents in the Mount Fuji area. Many students, women, and cultural groups from various places organized support teams and went to the Mount Fuji area to help farmers plant crops and wash clothes.

    Under the influence of the struggle to defend Mount Fuji, the struggle against the expansion of U.S. military bases in various parts of Japan expanded more widely. Shizuoka Prefecture, adjacent to Mount Fuji, established an action committee against the U.S. seizure of land near Mount Fuji. Farmers in many villages in Kanagawa Prefecture, with the support of trade union organizations in Yokohama City, prevented the U.S. military authorities from surveying new foundations. In particular, the residents of Tachikawa and other places, where the United States plans to expand air force bases, launched struggles, preventing the measurement work for the expansion of the bases from progressing. The residents of Sunagawa-machi near Tachikawa Air Force Base rang alarm bells whenever survey teams arrived, and hundreds of people immediately gathered, forcing the survey teams to retreat. Residents in other places, such as Komaki, Itami, Yokota, Kisarazu, and Niigata, have also launched struggles against the U.S. expansion of air force bases.

    Under the firm opposition of the Japanese people, the U.S. military authorities were forced to abandon plans to establish a military training ground in the Mount Myogi area of Japan, announced the removal of all anti-submarine nets in Tokyo Bay, abandoned plans to expand the Itazuke base, and recently announced the withdrawal of some troops from Japan, attempting to ease the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. expansion of air force bases. In addition, they are using so-called compromise measures (such as the plan to expand Tachikawa and other airports can be realized, Haneda Airport will be completely returned to Japan) to deceive and divide the Japanese people.

    However, the Japanese people's movement against U.S. military bases continues to develop in depth. Recently, 150 representatives from all over Japan who insisted on fighting against U.S. military bases held a "National Anti-Base Representatives Conference" in Tokyo, deciding to establish a "National Liaison Council Against Military Bases" to be responsible for coordinating anti-base activities in various places and serving as a central agency for negotiations with the government. The Japan Peace Advocates Conference held in Tokyo passed a resolution firmly opposing the use of Japanese bases by U.S. aircraft carrying atomic bombs, and to carry out the movement against the preparation for atomic warfare more widely. The declaration of the "National Rally to Protect Livelihood, Rights, and Land," attended by 50,000 people in Tokyo, put forward the slogan of "protecting the land from atomic bombs and military bases." Under the influence of the people's struggle, on July 14, the Cabinet Committee of the Japanese House of Councillors and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives held meetings to discuss the issue of local residents opposing the U.S. expansion of air force bases. According to Kyodo News, witnesses attending these two meetings unanimously expressed their determination to oppose any U.S. plan to expand even one inch of air force bases in Japan. The Japanese people's firm demand is: abolish U.S. military bases and troops stationed in Japan, restore Japan's independence, and prevent Japan from being drawn into aggressive military blocs and atomic warfare.

    日本人民反对美国在日本建立军事基地
    裴达
    在美国和日本订立了所谓旧金山“和约”之后，形式上取消了占领，但美国通过所谓“安全条约”和“行政协定”，继续在日本驻扎军队，并且无限制地建立军事基地，使日本实际上继续处于美国的军事占领之下。到现在，美国军事当局在日本已建立了陆海空军基地和雷达基地、军事演习场、兵营等军事设施约八百处，遍布日本全国。
    目前，美国正在日本扩充军事基地。日本调达厅长官福岛慎太郎曾对参议院预算委员会说，美国军队要求日本政府再给予三十七万七千三百英亩土地，以便扩大军事演习场和空军基地。最近，美国远东空军副司令麦克诺顿少将对来东京的美国新闻记者说，美国远东空军所面临的最大问题之一，是在日本获得土地来扩展容纳现代喷气式飞机所需要的跑道。据日本报纸报道，美国正在以富士山为中心扩充它在日本的军事基地网。立川、小牧、横田、木更津和新潟等空军基地的扩充工作正加紧进行，以供装载原子弹的大型喷气式飞机（B—47、B—52）起落。以富士山为中心的连结它周围基地的军用道路，也正在修建。
    美国在日本建立军事基地，不仅威胁亚洲国家的安全，而且首先使日本人民遭受到深重的灾难和屈辱。日本的经济受到极其不利的影响，特别是农民受害最甚。美军在日本的军事基地所占土地的面积约达二十万公顷，超过日本国土面积的二百分之一，平均不到五百平方公里就有基地或军事设施一处。在这些土地上，千百户的居民被迫离开了自己的家园。日本农业生产因此遭到严重的破坏，粮食产量减少，农民生活更加贫困。从北海道到九州的海岸线上，美军的海上演习场占了四万八千平方公里的渔场，使全日本二十万以上的渔民每年损失了二十五万吨的鱼产。不仅如此，美国驻日军职人员还享有治外法权，在基地所在地区横行霸道、胡作非为，侮辱日本人民民族感情和民族尊严。据共同社报道，从一九五三年十月到一九五四年八月底，美国人杀人、抢劫和强奸等犯罪案就有五千件，平均每月达五百件之多。美军驻地还成了伤风败俗的淫窟。一个美国随军牧师透露，仅在日本三泽美国空军基地的五千名居民中，就有妓女一千二百名。此外，由于美军经常演习，不绝于耳的飞机声、大炮声，闹得各地居民不得安宁。据最低的估计，约有七十个学校因此根本无法上课。早在一九五四年七月，日本“产业劳动日报”刊载的一篇题为“自从美国来了就没有好日子过”的文章就指出，美国军事基地对日本人民利益的损害，“已不是收获减少或收入减少的问题，而是到了生死存亡的关头”。
    愈来愈多的日本人认识到，美国在日本建立军事基地和驻扎军队使日本继续处于被占领和被损害的状态，并使日本有被卷进新的战争的危险。日本人民为了维护民族尊严，保卫生活，争取和平和独立，不断地进行了反对美国建立军事基地的斗争。广大农民、工人和社会团体、政党的代表都参加了这个斗争。斗争的形式开始是向国会请愿，在报刊上发表言论，继而举行群众大会、示威游行、罢工，以至集合起来阻止美军占用田地作为基地。一九五三年在石川县内滩村曾发生了轰动世界的事件，在很长时期内，内滩村的居民对美军在他们田地上开辟炮兵射击场一事，进行了英勇的抵抗。这个斗争后来很快地发展成为全国性的运动。
    近几月来，由于美国策划扩大在日本的军事基地，日本人民反对美国军事基地的运动更加高涨起来。当今年三月九日，美日联合委员会宣布美军要扩大富士山麓军事基地的计划之后，日本人民便立即起来进行有组织的斗争。首先，富士吉田市和山黎县以市长、县知事为首，连续召开了各界代表会和群众大会。他们坚决反对美军扩大军事基地，要求美军把它在富士山麓的军事演习场归还日本，并成立了领导这个运动的组织——要求归还北富士演习场同盟。许多富士山附近的居民到美军打靶场周围示威，反对美军实弹演习，并且不顾生命危险，冲破美军打靶的禁区线，在美军炮座附近和落弹区举行静坐斗争。
    富士山地区居民的这一正义斗争，迅速地在全国掀起了反对美国军事基地的新浪潮。拥有三百万会员的日本工会总评议会宣布，铁路、电力等十多个全国性工会组织决定派代表参加这个斗争。左派社会党国会对策委员会决定要发起一个运动，反对美国在日本保持和扩大军事基地。右派社会党众议员田原春次在一次众议院会议上，就美军炮击富士山向政府提出紧急质问。许多日本国会议员要求修改准许美军打靶的协定。当富士山地区居民反对美军打靶的时候，日本电力、铁路等工会组织派遣了一百个代表到富士山麓，彻夜地坐在美军炮座附近，阻止美军发炮。日本工会总评议会神山副议长，到山梨县支持富士山地区居民的斗争。各地许多学生、妇女和文化团体纷纷组织支援队，前往富士山地区帮助农民种地、洗衣服。
    在保卫富士山的斗争的影响下，日本各地反对美国扩大军事基地的斗争更广泛地扩展起来。邻近富士山的静冈县建立了反对美国没收富士山附近土地的行动委员会，神奈川县许多乡村的农民，在横滨市工会组织的支持下，阻止美军当局测量新地基。特别是在美国计划扩大的空军基地立川等地居民纷纷展开斗争，使扩充基地的测量工作一直没有进展。立川空军基地的砂川町居民，每逢测量队到来时就敲起警钟，数百名群众立即集合起来，迫使测量队退回去。其他如小牧、伊丹、横田、木更津、新潟等地居民，也都展开了反对美国扩大空军基地的斗争。
    美国军事当局在日本人民坚决反对之下，曾被迫放弃了在日本妙义山地区建立军事演习场的计划，宣布撤除在东京湾的全部防潜艇网，放弃了扩大板付基地的计划，最近并且宣布将从日本撤退一部分驻军，企图以此来缓和日本人民反对美国扩大空军基地的斗争，另外还以所谓妥协的办法（如扩大立川等机场的计划能够实现，羽田机场将全部归还日本），来欺骗和分化日本人民。
    但是，日本人民反对美国军事基地的运动，仍在继续深入发展。最近，日本全国各地坚持反对美国军事基地斗争的人民的代表一百五十人，在东京举行了“全国反对基地代表会议”，决定要成立“全国反对军事基地联络会议”，负责进行各地反对基地活动的联系工作，并作为向政府进行交涉的中心机构。在东京举行的日本和平爱好者大会通过一项决议，坚决反对美国装载原子弹的飞机利用日本基地，并且要把反对准备原子战争的运动更广泛地开展起来。在东京举行的有五万人参加的“保卫生活、权利和国土国民大集会”的宣言中，提出了“从原子弹、军事基地下保卫国土”的口号。在人民斗争的影响下，七月十四日，日本国会参议院的内阁委员会和众议院的外务委员会分别举行会议，也讨论了各地居民反对美国扩大空军基地的问题。据共同社报道，出席这两个会议的作证人，一致表示决心反对美国任何扩大一寸在日本的空军基地的计划。日本人民的坚决要求是：取消美国在日本的军事基地和驻军，恢复日本的独立，避免日本被卷进侵略军事集团和原子战争。
