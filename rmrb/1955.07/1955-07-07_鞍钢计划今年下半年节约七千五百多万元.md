Anshan Iron and Steel Company has formulated a plan to save over 75 million yuan in the second half of this year. The plan stipulates that the 40,000 square meters of employee dormitories that have not yet started construction will all be built according to the new cost standard of 30 to 40 yuan per square meter. The central library, originally planned to be built this year, will be accommodated by squeezing space from Anshan Iron and Steel's existing offices. The Anshan Iron and Steel Hygiene Department's office will be converted into an employee hospital, and the Hygiene Department's office will be replaced with other buildings. The cost of other residential and school projects already under construction is also planned to be reduced by 10% to 25%. In this way, more than 14 million yuan of investment can be saved in civil construction. In terms of reducing unnecessary construction projects, such as rationally organizing production in existing workshops and fully tapping potential, the sand cleaning workshop and magnesite brick workshop can be not be expanded, saving more than 3.6 million yuan in investment. The plan also decides to reduce the start-up costs and dormitory and office installation fees for some new factories. The necessary tables, chairs, typewriters, etc. in these places will be solved by internal adjustment within the company, thus saving 4.75 million yuan in the second half of this year.

At the end of June, Anshan Iron and Steel had already formulated dozens of saving measures plans in six areas, including reducing consumption quotas for raw materials, auxiliary materials, fuel, and power, and tightening management expenses. After these measures are implemented, costs can be reduced by more than 20 million yuan in the second half of this year alone. For example, in reducing raw material consumption, by improving the mix ratio of sintered ore raw materials and reducing consumption quotas, more than 20,000 tons of concentrate and rich iron ore powder can be saved. After each steel rolling mill implements measures such as "fixed-length steel cutting" and improving yield, more than 9,000 tons of steel billets can be saved.

Anshan Iron and Steel also plans to save more than 16 million yuan in working capital in the second half of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　鞍钢计划今年下半年节约七千五百多万元
    鞍山钢铁公司已经订出今年下半年节约七千五百多万元的计划。计划规定，现在还没有动工的四万平方公尺的职工宿舍，全部按每平方公尺三十元到四十元的新标准造价进行建筑；原准备在今年建筑的中央图库，将由鞍钢现有办公室中挤出；现在鞍钢卫生处的办公室改为职工医院，卫生处的办公室用别的房屋代替。其他已经施工的住宅、学校工程的造价也计划降低百分之十到百分之二十五。这样，民用建筑方面就可以节省一千四百多万元的投资。在削减不需要建筑的工程方面，如合理地组织现有车间的生产，充分发掘潜力以后，就可以不扩建清砂车间和镁砖车间，节约三百六十多万元的投资。计划中还决定削减一些新厂的开办费和宿舍、办公室的装置费，这些地方必需的桌、椅、打字机等，一律由公司内部调剂解决，因而今年下半年可节省四百七十五万元资金。
    六月底，鞍钢已经订出降低原材料、辅助材料、燃料、动力等消耗定额和紧缩管理费用等六个方面几十项节约措施计划。这些措施执行以后，仅今年下半年就可以降低成本二千多万元。如降低原材料消耗方面，改进烧结矿原料的配合比和降低消耗定额以后，可以节约精矿和富铁矿粉二万多吨。各轧钢厂贯彻“定尺切钢”及提高收得率等措施以后，可以节约钢坯九千多吨。
