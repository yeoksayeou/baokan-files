    Labor allocation work must be treated with a serious and responsible attitude

    To the Editor:
    In May of this year, the Tangshan City Labor Bureau issued a circular criticizing the Tangshan City Construction Company for its mistakes in blindly recruiting personnel and allocating workers. In January of this year, the company recruited 26 recorders through the Labor Bureau's examination; however, they were never notified to report for duty, and in April they were told that they were no longer needed. The company had requested the Labor Bureau to allocate workers several times, but after the workers arrived at the company, they were told that they were not needed; sometimes the company assigned workers to construction sites, but they were returned by the construction sites. The circular pointed out that the company should correct these erroneous practices.
    However, this circular did not attract the attention of the Tangshan City Construction Company, and similar events still occur frequently in this company. On June 13, the company hired 104 laborers (all construction workers and demobilized soldiers from the suburbs) through the Labor Bureau, and all of them were assigned to the Second Engineering Zone on the same day; the Second Engineering Zone assigned work to the workers and asked them to report to the construction sites the next day. The next day, the workers went to the construction sites, but they were all turned back; it turned out that the construction sites did not need to add so many workers (only 45 were needed). The Second Engineering Zone contacted the company's Labor and Wage Section, blaming each other for a while, and finally decided to lend the remaining workers to the First and Third Engineering Zones. These two engineering zones were going to assign the workers to work at construction sites 50 miles away. Some workers raised objections because they had already been running back and forth and were exhausted. The two engineering zones did not explain, but instead sent the workers back to the Second Engineering Zone. At that time, it was raining, and the workers were getting wet in the yard after arriving at the Second Engineering Zone, while the staff of the Second Engineering Zone sat in the room chatting idly, without solving the workers' work problems.
    In addition, the company reserved 1,200 workers last November. The contract stipulated that the workers should report on May 30 of this year; if the company needed to terminate the reservation relationship due to changes in the task, it should notify the Labor Bureau 15 days in advance. However, the company did not issue a notice to terminate the reservation relationship until May 31, by which time more than 300 migrant workers from Ba County, Fengrun, Yutian and other counties had arrived from afar one after another.
    The Tangshan City Construction Company's irresponsible attitude towards labor allocation work and its disregard for the Labor Bureau's circular criticism are intolerable, and it is recommended that the leading organs promptly deal with this issue.

### 必须用认真负责的态度对待劳动力调配工作

    必须用认真负责的态度对待劳动力调配工作编辑同志：
    今年五月，唐山市劳动局通报批评了唐山市建筑公司盲目招用人员和调配工人的错误。这个公司在今年一月通过劳动局招考录用了二十六名记录人员；但是一直不通知他们到职工作，拖到四月份说是全部不要了。这个公司曾好几次请劳动局调配工人，但在工人到公司后又说不要了；有时公司把工人分配到工地，却被工地退了回来。通报指出，这个公司应该纠正这些错误做法。
    但是，这个通报并没有引起唐山市建筑公司的重视，类似的事件仍然在这个公司经常出现。六月十三日，公司通过劳动局招雇了壮工一百零四人（都是郊区的建筑工人和转业军人），当天全部介绍到二工区；二工区把工人分配了工作，让他们第二天到各工地上班。第二天工人分别到了各工地，但都被退了回来；原来工地并不需要增加这么多工人（只需四十五名）。二工区就同公司劳动工薪科联系，互相责怪了一阵，最后决定把其余工人借给一工区和三工区。这两个工区要把工人分配到五十里外的工地去工作。有的工人因为已经往返奔走，疲劳不堪，就提出意见。这两个工区却不进行解释，就把工人又介绍回二工区。当时天正下雨，工人们到二工区后都在院子里挨淋，二工区的工作人员们坐在屋里闲谈，不给工人解决工作问题。
    另外，这个公司去年十一月预约了一千二百名工人。合同规定工人应在今年五月三十日报到；公司如因任务改变而要解除预约关系，应在十五天前通知劳动局。但是，公司到五月三十一日才发出通知要解除预约关系，这时已有霸县、丰润、玉田等县三百多个民工陆续远道跑来了。
    唐山市建筑公司对劳动力调配工作的不负责任的现象和对劳动局通报批评置之不理的态度是不能令人容忍的，建议领导机关迅速处理这个问题。
