The State Council机关事务管理局 Saves Construction Project Expenses

    (By our reporter) The State Council机关事务管理局, which is responsible for the construction projects of office buildings and dormitories for central-level government agencies, originally planned to build 400,000 square meters this year. In the spirit of practicing comprehensive economy, after review, the construction area of these projects has been reduced by more than 160,000 square meters. Through reducing the construction area, changing the design, and reducing the costs of decoration and equipment for projects under construction, the state can save more than 43 million yuan, a reduction of two-thirds compared to the original planned investment.
    Although the planned cost of various projects of the State Council机关事务管理局 this year has been reduced somewhat compared to the past two years, the cost is still too high according to the new construction standards. The cost of office buildings is generally between 120 and 140 yuan per square meter; the cost of dormitories is generally between 100 and 110 yuan per square meter, and the cost of individual units is as high as more than 150 yuan per square meter. Now, after calculation, all projects that have already started or are preparing to start construction in July after modifying the original design can generally reduce the original planned cost by more than 15%, and the maximum reduction is 48.5%. Projects starting in August will be constructed strictly in accordance with the new standards, with the cost of office buildings reduced to less than 70 yuan per square meter and dormitories reduced to less than 60 yuan per square meter. At present, the first batch of new residential buildings designed by the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design has completed the preliminary design. The unit cost of these residential buildings is within 58 yuan. Each family has two rooms, one large and one small, one kitchen, a balcony for drying clothes and a stove. The house also has heating equipment and public sanitation facilities. Its practical standard is not lower than in the past.

    国务院机关事务管理局节约建筑工程费用
    本报讯　国务院机关事务管理局负责管理的中央级各机关办公楼房和宿舍等建筑工程，今年原计划为四十万平方公尺。根据厉行全面节约的精神，经过审核，这些工程已经减少了十六万多平方公尺的建筑面积。从削减建筑面积、改变设计和对于正在施工的工程减少装修、设备等费用方面，共可为国家节约资金四千三百多万元，比原计划投资数减少三分之二。
    国务院机关事务管理局今年各项工程的计划造价，虽然比过去两年降低了一些，但是按照新的建筑标准来衡量，造价仍然过高。办公楼每平方公尺一般是一百二十元到一百四十元；宿舍每平方公尺一般是一百元到一百一十元，个别单位每平方公尺的造价有的高达一百五十元以上。现在，经过核算以后，凡是已经开工的或就原设计进行修改准备在七月份开工的工程，一般都可以比原计划造价降低百分之十五以上，最多有降低了百分之四十八点五的。八月起开工的工程，将严格按照新的标准施工，办公楼每平方公尺的造价降低到七十元以内，宿舍降低到六十元以内。目前，北京市设计院为他们设计的第一批新的住宅楼房，初步设计已经做好。这批住宅楼房的单位造价在五十八元以内。每家有一大一小两个房间，一家一个厨房，每家有凉台晒衣服和生火炉。屋内还有暖气设备和公共卫生设备。它的实用标准并没有比过去低。
