Title: The Aggressor Admits Guilt Without Being Forced

On the eve of the Four-Power Summit, on July 14th, the U.S. Senate passed two resolutions aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere and creating difficulties for the great power conference.

One of the two resolutions, which was proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives a long time ago, expresses the U.S.'s opposition to so-called "imperialism" and "other forms of colonialism." The U.S. attempts to use this resolution to slander the socialist camp, conceal its colonial aggression around the world, deceive the colonial peoples striving for independence and freedom, and shirk all responsibility for the current international tensions caused by the U.S. aggressive policy.

The other resolution passed by the U.S. Senate further exposes the true face of the U.S. aggression group, confessing guilt without being forced.

The preamble to this resolution states that millions of people in Europe and Asia live under so-called "totalitarian imperialism." Indeed, in Europe and Asia, and also in the Americas and Africa, millions of people are living in the clutches of U.S. imperialism. This net is successfully organized by U.S. monopoly capital, military bases, overseas troops, and a handful of politicians bought with dollars. The U.S. is like a giant octopus, and wherever its aggressive tentacles extend, the people there fall into the abyss of disaster.

Of course, U.S. senators do not want to expose this bloody fact, but want to divert people's attention from this fact by slandering the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. They insist that the socialist system "increases" the "threat to the security" of free people, including the United States.

But socialist countries have not threatened any countries with different social systems, nor have they invaded the territory of any country. This is recognized by people of justice all over the world. They know that all steps taken after the war to ease the international situation and eliminate the threat of war were proactively taken by socialist countries. However, launching the Korean War, invading China's Taiwan, subverting the Guatemalan government, and other things that threaten the independence and security of various countries were all done by the United States. Isn't it a clear fact that it is the United States, which is yelling that its security is supposedly "threatened," that is threatening the security of all free people?

Moreover, what kind of state system a country adopts is an internal matter of that country. It is absurd to say that a state system can "threaten" others, just like saying that a person can make others catch a cold by putting on his own clothes. There can only be one explanation for U.S. senators saying this: they want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and use the excuse of "threatening" U.S. security to change the state system of other countries. This is also the purpose openly declared in the resolution passed by the U.S. Senate.

The resolution states that the United States hopes that the people under the so-called "foreign despotic system" will "re-enjoy the right to self-determination within a system sufficient to maintain peace." If this sentence is translated into plain language, it means that the United States wants to carry out subversive activities in the socialist camp countries, overthrow the socialist system of these countries, restore capitalism in those countries, and incorporate them into the U.S. aggressive system.

In this way, the U.S. Senate openly declares that subverting the governments of other countries is the principle of U.S. foreign policy and the guideline of U.S. diplomatic activities. The U.S.'s abandonment of all international law, its contempt for the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and its taking interference in the internal affairs of other countries and aggression against other countries as its own task is an unprecedentedly ugly act in the history of international relations.

The U.S. aggression group's conspiracy to subvert the socialist camp countries is, at best, wishful thinking. The more it clamors like this, the more it proves that its subversive activities are not going smoothly. At the same time, its attempt to obstruct the great power conference with these tension-creating resolutions will make the world more clearly aware of the true face of U.S. imperialism, and will make the U.S. aggression group more isolated and despised.

    侵略者不打自招
    在四国首脑会议前夕，七月十四日，美国参议院里通过了两项目的在于毒化国际气氛、给大国会议制造困难的决议。
    两项决议中的一项是由美国众议院老早提出来的，其中表示美国反对所谓“帝国主义”和“其他形式的殖民主义”。美国企图用这项决议诬蔑社会主义阵营，并掩饰它在全世界所进行的殖民侵略，欺骗争取独立和自由的殖民地人民，推卸美国侵略政策对于造成目前国际紧张局势应负的全部责任。
    美国参议院所通过的另一项决议进一步不打自招地暴露了美国侵略集团的真面目。
    这项决议在前言中说，在欧洲和亚洲有千百万人民生活在所谓“极权帝国主义”之下。的确，在欧洲和亚洲，而且还有美洲和非洲，千百万人民正生活在美国帝国主义的罗网之中。这个罗网是由美国的垄断资本、军事基地、海外部队和一小撮被美元收买的政客组织成功的。美国像一头巨大的章鱼，它的侵略的触角伸到哪里，那里的人民就落进了灾难的深渊。
    当然，美国参议员并不是想揭露这个血淋淋的事实，而是想用诬蔑苏联、中国和各人民民主国家来转移人们对于这个事实的注意。他们硬说社会主义制度“增加了”包括美国在内的自由人民的“安全所受的威胁”。
    但是社会主义国家并没有威胁任何不同社会制度的国家，也没有侵略任何国家的领土。这是全世界有正义感的人们所承认的，他们知道，战后一切足以缓和国际局势、消除战争威胁的步骤都是社会主义国家主动采取的。而发动朝鲜战争、侵占中国的台湾、颠覆危地马拉政府等等威胁各国的独立和安全的事情，却都是美国干下的勾当。威胁一切自由人民的安全的正是大叫自己的安全受到了所谓“威胁”的美国，这难道不是明摆着的事实？
    而且，一个国家采取怎样的国家制度，是这个国家内部的事情。硬说国家制度能够“威胁”到别人，就像说一个人穿上自己的衣服就能使别人受凉一样荒唐。美国参议员们说这种话只能有一个解释，这就是他们要干涉别国的内政，要用“威胁”美国安全为借口来改变别国的国家制度。这也就是美国参议院通过的这个决议所公然宣布的目的。
    这个决议说，美国希望在所谓“外国专制制度”下的人民将在“足以维持和平的体制内重新享受自决的权利”。如果把这句话翻成明白易懂的话，就是美国要在社会主义阵营各国进行颠覆活动，推翻这些国家的社会主义制度，使资本主义在那些国家复辟，并把它们纳入美国的侵略体制。
    美国参议院这样就公然地宣布：颠覆其他国家的政府是美国外交政策的原则和美国外交活动的方针。美国这样背弃一切国际公法、蔑视联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，把干涉别国内政和侵略其他国家作为自己的任务，是国际关系史中空前未有的丑恶行为。
    美国侵略集团颠覆社会主义阵营各国的阴谋充其量也不过是痴心妄想。它愈是这样叫嚷，就愈是证明它的颠覆活动进行得并不顺利。同时，它想用这些制造紧张的决议来阻挠大国会议，也将使全世界更加清楚地认识到美帝国主义的真面目，并且使美国侵略集团更加处于众所不齿的孤立地位。
