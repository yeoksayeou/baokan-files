The Chinese Pavilion at the Poznań International Fair
By our correspondent Li He

"We wish China further brilliant achievements in the peaceful and creative labor of building socialism" – these are the friendly wishes left in the inscription by the Polish government delegation led by Comrade Bolesław Bierut after visiting the People's Republic of China Pavilion at the opening of the Poznań International Fair on July 3. Since that day, the Chinese Pavilion has been one of the most visited pavilions at the fair. This magnetic attraction will be maintained until the last moment of the fair's closing on July 24, because the Chinese Pavilion brings to the Polish people a basic picture of our country's progress on the socialist road, and because the Polish people hope to increase their understanding of our people's construction.

Poznań is located in western Poland, midway on the railway from Warsaw to Berlin. Twenty-five countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as two hundred and fifty private companies from the West, participated in the Poznań International Fair. Many transactions were completed between the East and the West at the fair. This fair, like the past Leipzig fairs and the upcoming Plovdiv fair in Bulgaria this September, not only demonstrates the prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries but also illustrates that these countries, despite their different social systems from Western countries, can still develop trade relations. Facts have proven that this connection cannot be blocked even by those who deliberately maintain international tension. People from all corners of the world and from all over Poland came to Poznań to visit, many traveling there and back on the same day. In the first five days of the fair's opening, there were 250,000 visitors. The Chinese Pavilion was recognized as one of the most beautiful and interesting pavilions.

The Chinese Pavilion is located in the center of the fair, covering an area of more than 5,000 square meters. In front of the main pavilion, the Five-Star Red Flag fluttered in the wind on all sides. A constant stream of people walked through the Chinese national-style gate, admired the full-body statue of Chairman Mao in the entrance hall, looked at the photos of the meeting between the leaders of China and Poland and the signing of the Sino-Polish economic and cultural agreement hanging on both walls, and felt the atmosphere of close friendship between China and Poland. People marveled at the rich reserves of gold, antimony, tin, aluminum, tungsten, and molybdenum in the right corridor, and counted the products of coal, petroleum, construction, and chemical industries in the left corridor. The model of the hydraulic sand filling coal mining method of the Fushun Coal Mine, illuminated by electricity, attracted the interest of Polish friends from the developed coal industry. In the rear corridor, people paid attention to steel pipes, steel plates, steel materials, and non-ferrous metal ingots. In the square in front of the main pavilion, people saw powerful tower cranes, coal mining combines, rock drills, drilling machines, and other mining machinery. In the squares on each side of the main pavilion, people saw power machines and agricultural machines. In the machinery hall behind the main pavilion, various machine tools were displayed, among which the "1A-62" high-speed lathe and the textile winder attracted the most attention. The speed of China's industrial development, as well as the unlimited potential and prospects, shown in these industrial sections, aroused the amazement of the audience. "The Poznań Newspaper" said: "China, not long ago, was a country that almost had to import even raw materials. Today, China's industry has become an increasingly important component in the world market... The vigorous development of Chinese industry is a convincing proof of the unlimited possibilities of the development of this country that has embarked on the socialist road."

In the agricultural section of the main pavilion, people saw China's rich and diverse agricultural products – grains, oil crops, tea, hemp, egg products, bristles, furs, as well as models of fruits and vegetables. They cast admiring glances at the fruits, and some expressed the hope to have the opportunity to taste them. The audience paid attention to the water conservancy project models of the Foziling Reservoir and the Guanting Reservoir and were extremely concerned about the charts showing the development of agricultural cooperativization in our country. Some cooperative farmers left messages after visiting, extending brotherly respect to the cooperative farmers of our country.

Many daily industrial products and handicrafts were exhibited upstairs in the main pavilion. Here, without following the crowd, one could hardly see anything. Porcelain, pottery, lacquerware, silverware, ivory carvings, jade carvings, stone carvings, wood carvings, bamboo carvings, embroidery, and carpets were all carefully admired by the audience. One teacher left a message: "I think the Chinese people are artists." Silk and textiles were the focus of the audience's attention. The colorful and diverse silks and satins made the female audience dazzled and reluctant to leave. They said that Chinese silk is not an industrial product but a work of art.

The People's Republic of China Pavilion at the Poznań International Fair showed the great achievements of our country's construction to the people of various countries and played its due role in promoting Sino-Polish friendship. The Polish people enthusiastically left their strong impressions in the opinion book: "The Chinese Pavilion opened my eyes to see new China." "Your pavilion is a proof of the strength and powerful growth of your great people and the entire peaceful and socialist camp." "The Chinese people have shown their economic and political strength. May Sino-Polish friendship last forever."

    波兹南国际博览会上的中国展览馆
    本报记者　李何
    “我们祝中国在建设社会主义的和平和创造性的劳动中获得更进一步的辉煌成就”——这是七月三日波兹南国际博览会开幕时由贝鲁特同志率领的波兰政府代表团在参观中华人民共和国馆后题词中留下的友好的希望。从这一天起，中国馆在博览会上一直是吸引最多观众的展览馆之一。这种磁力将会保持到七月二十四日博览会闭幕的最后一刻。因为中国馆带给波兰人民以我国在社会主义道路上前进的基本景象，因为波兰人民希望增加对我国人民的建设的了解。
    波兹南在波兰西部从华沙到柏林的铁路的中途。有苏联、波兰、越南民主共和国等二十五个国家和西方二百五十家私人公司参加了波兹南国际博览会。东西方在博览会上作成了不少交易。这次博览会正如过去在莱比锡和今年九月将在保加利亚的普罗夫迪夫举行的博览会一样，不但显示苏联和人民民主国家经济的繁荣和力量的强大，而且说明这些国家尽管社会制度和西方国家不同，仍然可以发展贸易联系。事实证明，这种联系是蓄意保持国际紧张局势的分子封锁也封锁不住的。从世界各个角落来的人们和波兰各地人民络绎不绝地来到波兹南参观，许多人朝来晚归。博览会开幕头五天，观众就有二十五万人。中国馆被公认是最美、最有兴趣的展览馆之一。
    中国馆在博览会的中心，面积五千多平方公尺。在正馆前，四面五星红旗迎风招展。川流不息的人们走进中国民族色彩的大门，景仰入口大厅中毛主席的全身塑像，盼顾两边墙上悬挂的中波两国人民领袖会见和中波两国经济文化协定签字的照片，感受到中波两国亲密友谊的气氛。人们在右边走廊赞叹金、锑、锡、铝、钨、钼等富藏，在左边走廊点数煤、石油、建筑和化学工业的产品。用电光示意的抚顺煤矿的水砂充填采煤法模型，吸引煤业发达的波兰友人的兴趣。在后边廊上人们注目钢管、钢板、钢材和有色金属的铸锭。在正馆前面广场上，人们看到强大的塔式起重机、采煤联合机、凿岩机、钻探机和其它矿山机械。在正馆各侧广场上，人们又看到动力机器和农业机器。在正馆后面的机械馆里，陈列着各式工作母机，其中“一A—六二”式高速车床和纺织的络筒机，最受注意。这些工业部分所显示的中国工业发展的速度以及无限的潜力和前途，引起观众的惊叹。“波兹南报”说：“中国在不久以前还是个几乎连原料都要输入的国家，今天中国的工业在世界市场上成为愈来愈重要的组成者……中国工业蓬勃的发展，是这个走上社会主义道路的国家的发展的无限可能性的令人信服的证明。”
   人们在正馆的农业部分中看到中国丰富多样的农产品——粮食、油料、茶叶、麻、蛋品、猪鬃、皮毛以及水果、蔬菜的模型。他们向水果投着欣赏的眼光，有些表示希望有机会尝尝味道。观众注意佛子岭水库和官厅水库的水利工程模型，对于显示我国农业合作化发展的图表极为关切，有些合作社农民在参观后留字向我国合作社农民致兄弟的敬意。
    在正馆楼上展览了许多日用工业品和手工艺品。在这里，不随着人群的行列休想看到东西。磁器、陶器、漆器、银器、象牙雕刻、玉刻、石刻、木刻、竹刻、刺绣、地毯，每一件都受到观众的仔细观赏。一位教员留言：“我认为中国人民是艺术家。”丝绸和纺织品是观众视线的焦点。彩色缤纷的各式绸缎，使妇女观众们目不暇接和舍不得离开。她们说，中国的丝绸不是工业品而是艺术品。
    波兹南国际博览会上的中华人民共和国馆，在各国人们面前显出了我国建设的伟大成就，对于促进中波友谊起着应有的影响。波兰人民踊跃地在意见簿上留下自己的强烈印象：“中国馆打开了我看新中国的眼界。”“你们的馆是你们的伟大的人民，也是整个和平和社会主义阵营的力量强大增长的证明。”“中国人民显示出自己经济上和政治上的强大。愿中波友谊长存。”
