　　Two Suggestions Regarding Translations
　　Wang Yuzhen
    The translation of proper nouns must strive for uniformity. In the current translation field, where there are no unified regulations for many proper nouns, although achieving complete uniformity is difficult, consistency should be sought for those common proper nouns. At the very least, a proper noun should not have different translations within the same book.

    However, the translation of proper nouns is currently very chaotic in many books. For example, the name of a small village in Siberia where Lenin was exiled at the end of the 19th century has at least four translations: "Sushenskoye Village" (translated by Cao Baohua in "The Development of Capitalism in Russia"), "Shoushan Village" ("A Brief History of Lenin's Life and Work"), "Shoushanskoe Village" ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)"), and "Shushinskoe Village" (translated by Ge Baoquan in "On Lenin's book 'The Development of Capitalism in Russia'"). In addition, the term "Tumi Dor" on page 223 of Volume 1 of the advanced group edition of "On Soviet Socialist Economic Construction" is translated as "Qimitu'er" in Volume 2, page 114, and as "Temi Dor" in Volume 3, page 169.

    Regarding the names of people in foreign books, many translators only translate the surname and not the given name and patronymic. This makes it impossible for readers to identify who the person is. For example, "Shebilov" is mentioned on page 40 of the Chinese translation of Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," but there is also an author named "Xuebilov" in the first collection of "Reference Materials for Studying 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR'". Because these two surnames are the same in Russian, readers are confused as to whether they are the same person or two different people.

　　对于译名的两点意见
　　王玉震
    专有名词的翻译必须力求统一。在目前翻译界对于许多专有名词还没有统一规定的情况下，虽然要做到完全的统一是有困难的，但是对于那些普通的专有名词也应求得一致，至少是一个专有名词在同一本书中决不应有不同的译法。
    然而，目前很多书中专有名词的翻译十分混乱。例如，列宁在十九世纪末流放到西伯利亚的一个小村的名称，至少就有四种译法：“苏辛斯克村”（曹葆华译：“俄国资本主义底发展”），“寿山村”（“列宁生平事业简史”），“寿山斯克村”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”）和“舒新斯考野村”（戈宝权译：“关于列宁著‘俄国资本主义的发展’一书”）。此外，“论苏联社会主义经济建设”高级组第一册第二二三页中“图米多尔”一词，在第二册第一一四页中译为“齐米图尔”，在第三册第一六九页中又译为“特米多尔”。
    关于外国书籍中的人名，很多译者只译出姓氏，而未译出本名和父名。这样就使读者无法辨别这个人究竟是谁。例如，斯大林所著“苏联社会主义经济问题”中译本第四十页中曾提到“舍比洛夫”，但是“学习‘苏联社会主义经济问题’参考资料”第一辑中有一篇文章作者也叫“雪比洛夫”。由于这两个姓氏在俄文上是一样的，所以读者就搅不清二者究竟是一个人还是两个人了。
