The Five-Year Plan Expresses the Aspirations of Patriotic Industrialists and Businessmen
National People's Congress Representative Rong Yiren

At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and I felt extremely delighted and encouraged. This plan outlines a brilliant and splendid vision for the motherland, paves the way for a socialist society, reflects the common will of the people of the whole country, and also expresses the common aspirations of patriotic industrialists and businessmen. The full realization of this plan will bring about significant changes in our national economy, lay the foundation for the increasing prosperity of our country and the happy life of the people, and strengthen the power of the world's peace and democracy camp, safeguarding lasting world peace.

Our country is an economically backward country. Although some patriots advocated "saving the country through industry" and industrialists and businessmen opened some factories, due to the imperialist aggression and oppression, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie's and reactionary rule's deception and plunder, what we were able to build with great difficulty were only some light industries with weak foundations. Heavy industry was pitifully small. Even these light industries suffered from insufficient raw material supplies due to the scattered and backward nature of agricultural production, and production was also insufficient. Moreover, because we did not have our own heavy industry, most of the machinery and materials needed to be imported from abroad, and we suffered all kinds of bullying. Now, the Five-Year Plan prioritizes the development of heavy industry, which will enable us to manufacture various modern industrial equipment and transportation tools to meet needs, reform existing enterprises, and increase industrial production; supply agriculture with needed agricultural tools and fertilizers, so that both grain and cash crops can increase; reverse the situation of being dependent on others, and create a foundation for self-reliance. At the same time, we can also manufacture modern weapons to strengthen national defense and protect the people's democratic power. Only the Communist Party leadership can do such a great thing.

To achieve the entire plan, we need sufficient funds. To accumulate funds, we must practice strict economy and oppose waste. In the past, the waste in our private industries was very serious. Taking the enterprises I run as an example, the waste is shocking. When there is money, it is used randomly without a plan, without considering the economic effects of the investment or whether it is necessary. For example, the bathroom in one factory has been rebuilt three times in the past five years, which has greatly wasted funds. When there is no money, nothing is done; things that should be repaired are not repaired, and materials that should be added are not added, which affects production. Regarding the waste of raw materials, taking raw cotton as an example, although our factories in Shanghai have now achieved an average of 387 jin of cotton per bale of yarn, even compared to the average of 396 jin of cotton per bale of yarn for the entire last year, the raw cotton wasted last year was also considerable. Compared with the 383 jin of cotton used by some advanced factories this year, there is still great potential. The above situation reduces profits and affects improvement for the enterprise; for the country, it also reduces capital accumulation and reduces the funds that can be invested in construction. Vice Premier Li said: "A very strict economy system must be implemented, all superfluous expenditures and inappropriate non-productive expenditures must be eliminated, and no slight waste can be allowed, in order to accumulate all possible funds to ensure the needs of national construction and to increase the necessary reserve strength of the country." This is completely correct, and we should implement it in accordance with this principle.

This plan points out that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state will be achieved in two steps: first, transforming capitalism into state capitalism, and second, transforming state capitalism into socialism. This is what Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "We will give capitalists a necessary period of time to gradually accept transformation under the leadership of the state and the working class." Since we private industrialists and businessmen recognize the bright future of our country and ourselves, we should play our due role correctly in the implementation of this Five-Year Plan, obey the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working masses, work hard in our respective positions, study diligently, and accept transformation. This is our correct path. This "necessary period of time" is quite long, which requires us to redouble our efforts, follow closely, play a beneficial role, make certain contributions to the country and the people, and constantly transform ourselves ideologically and actionally, so that we can become citizens of a socialist society in the future and not fall behind.

Our ability to carry out construction in a planned way is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. In particular, the Soviet Union provides comprehensive assistance to our construction in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources, with 156 industrial units, from surveying and design to equipment supply and production. This kind of generous and selfless assistance can only exist within the socialist peace and democracy camp. The Soviet Union is also helping our country begin the construction of peaceful uses of atomic energy. This shows that the Soviet Union has made outstanding achievements in the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy, and it does not monopolize these experiences, but contributes these achievements so that atomic energy can be used for peaceful construction and benefit mankind. We thank the Soviet Union for its assistance, and we are more determined in our confidence in active construction, believing that if we build rapidly according to this Five-Year Plan, it will satisfy the happy life of the people throughout the country and strengthen the power of the peace and democracy camp.

While we are engaged in peaceful construction, the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are unwilling to accept it, and they are trying their best to carry out sabotage activities. Facts have also proven this. If we are satisfied with the achievements of construction and ignore the harm of counter-revolutionaries carrying out sabotage, it will bring serious disasters to our construction results. Therefore, we must strive to consolidate the unity within our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, on the one hand, work hard and actively build, and on the other hand, be vigilant, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and smash any conspiracies and tricks of enemies at home and abroad, and strive to victoriously complete and overfulfill our country's First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.

    五年计划表达了爱国工商业者的愿望
    全国人民代表大会代表　荣毅仁
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，我听到了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，感到万分的欢欣鼓舞。这一计划，为祖国画出了光辉灿烂的远景，铺设了走向社会主义社会的道路，反映了全国人民的共同意志，也表达了爱国工商业者的共同愿望。这个计划的全部实现，将使我国国民经济发生重大的变化，为我国的日益富强和人民幸福生活奠定基础；并将增强世界和平民主阵营的力量，保卫世界持久和平。
    我国在经济上是一个落后的国家，虽然有若干爱国人士提倡过“实业救国”，工商业者开设了一些工厂；但是，由于帝国主义者的侵略压迫，官僚资产阶级和反动统治的欺诈掠夺，我们千辛万苦所能建立起来的只是一些基础薄弱的轻工业，重工业是渺小得可怜。即是这些轻工业，也由于农业生产的分散落后，原料不够供应，生产也是不足。而且因为自己没有重工业，机器材料，大部分需要国外输入，也受尽了欺侮。现在五年计划要优先发展重工业，这样就能制造各种现代化的工业设备和交通工具，来供应需要和改革原有企业，提高工业生产；供给农业上需要的农具和肥料，使粮食和经济作物都能增加；扭转仰人鼻息的状态，创造自立更生的基础。同时，我们也能制造现代化的武器，来充实国防，保卫人民民主政权。这样的大好事，只有共产党领导才能做。
    我们要实现全部计划，就需要足够的资金。要积累资金，就必须厉行节约，反对浪费。过去我们私营工业浪费的情况也是十分严重的。就以我所经营的企业为例，浪费情况是惊人的。对于资金，有钱的时候，无计划地乱用，既不考虑投资的经济效果，也不考虑是否必需。如有一个厂里的浴室，五年来已改建了三次，这就大大地浪费了资金。到了没有钱的时候，就什么也不做，该修理的也不修理，应添的材料也不添，影响了生产。对于原材料的浪费，仅以原棉为例，我们上海的几个厂现在虽然已经做到每件纱用棉量平均三百八十七斤，但是即以去年全年平均每件纱用棉三百九十六斤来比较，去年一年浪费的原棉也是很可观的。如以今年有的先进厂用棉三百八十三斤来比较，则尚有很大潜力。上述情况，对企业来说是减少了利润，影响了改进；对国家来说，也是减少了资金积累，减少了可能投资建设的资金。李副总理说：“必须实行极严格的节约制度，消除一切多余的开支和不适当的非生产的开支，不能容许任何微小的浪费，以便积聚一切可能的资金，用来保证国家建设事业的需要，并增加国家必要的后备力量。”这是完全正确的，我们应当按照这方针来贯彻。
    这个计划，指出了国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造分两个步骤来实现，即第一步把资本主义转变为国家资本主义，第二步把国家资本主义转变为社会主义。这就是刘少奇委员长所说的：“我们将让资本家们有一个必要的时间在国家和工人阶级的领导下逐步接受改造。”我们私营工商业者既然认识到我们国家和自己的光明前途，就应该在实行这个五年计划中正确地发挥应有的作用，服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，接受工人群众的监督，在各自岗位上努力工作，认真学习，接受改造，这是我们正确的途径。这“一个必要的时间”相当长，这就需要我们加倍努力，紧紧追随，发挥有益的作用，对国家人民作出一定的贡献，在思想上、行动上不断地改造，到将来能成为社会主义社会的公民，不致掉队。
    我们能够有计划地进行建设，是同苏联及各人民民主国家的援助分不开的。特别是苏联，从人力物力财力各方面来援助我们建设，一百五十六个工业单位，从勘察设计供应设备一直到开工生产予以全面的援助。这种慷慨无私的援助，只有在社会主义和平民主阵营中间才会有。苏联并且帮助我国开始和平利用原子能的建设。这说明了苏联在和平利用原子能方面的研究有了卓越的成就，它不把这些经验独占起来，而把这些成就贡献出来，使原子能用之于和平建设，为人类造福。我们感谢苏联的援助，我们更坚定了积极建设的信心，相信我们按照这一个五年计划迅速地建设起来，将会满足全国人民幸福的生活，将为和平民主阵营增强力量。
    当我们在进行和平建设的时候，帝国主义者和蒋介石卖国集团是不甘心的，它们千方百计地要来进行破坏活动。事实也证明如此，我们如果满足于建设的成就而忽视了反革命分子进行破坏的危害性，必将为我们的建设成果带来严重的灾害。因此，我们必须努力巩固我们人民内部的团结，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，一方面努力工作，积极建设，一方面提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎任何国内外敌人的阴谋诡计，为胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。
