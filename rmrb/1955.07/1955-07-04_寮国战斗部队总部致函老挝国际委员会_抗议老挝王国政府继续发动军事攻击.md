　　Lao Fighting Forces Headquarters Sends Letter to International Commission in Laos
　　Protesting the Lao Royal Government's Continued Military Attacks
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 3rd: According to a delayed dispatch from Laos by the Vietnam News Agency, the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces wrote a letter to the International Commission in Laos on June 23rd, protesting the Lao Royal Government’s continued military attacks against the Lao Fighting Forces stationed in the regrouping areas of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces.
    The letter stated that by mid-June 1955, the Royal Government's troops had infiltrated Sam Neua province several times. On June 21st, two companies of Royal Government troops launched a new attack, occupying the Sala area of Sam Neua province. In addition, the armed forces of the Lao Royal Government also occupied the villages of Na Khang and Pha Gu Hai. They transferred a battalion of troops from Xieng Khouang to Ba Kha in Sam Neua province. They also dispatched another battalion of troops to Na Gang in order to prepare for infiltration into Sam Neua province.
    The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces pointed out in its protest letter that the aforementioned actions have made the situation serious. The Lao Royal Government is increasingly shamelessly carrying out its conspiracy to gradually occupy the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly.
    The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces requested the International Commission to conduct an on-site investigation and suggested that the Lao Royal Government cease its military infiltration into the regrouping areas of the Lao Fighting Forces, cease all armed attacks against the Lao Fighting Forces, and withdraw its armed forces currently stationed in Muong Phun from Sam Neua province.

　　寮国战斗部队总部致函老挝国际委员会
　　抗议老挝王国政府继续发动军事攻击
    新华社河内三日电　据越南通讯社引来自老挝的一项迟到消息说，寮国战斗部队总司令部曾在六月二十三日给老挝国际委员会写了一封信，抗议老挝王国政府继续对驻在重新集结区桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队发动军事攻击。
    这封信说，到一九五五年六月中旬，王国政府军队几次渗入了桑怒省。在六月二十一日，王国政府部队的两连军队发动一次新的攻击，占领了桑怒省的沙拉地区。此外，老挝王国政府的武装部队还占领了那康和发古海村。他们从川圹调了一营军队前往桑怒省的巴卡。他们又派遣了另一营军队前往那冈，以便准备渗入桑怒省。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部在抗议信中指出：上述行动已使局势严重起来。老挝王国政府方面已经愈来愈无耻地在实行逐步占领桑怒和丰沙里两省的阴谋。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部要求国际委员会进行现场调查，并建议老挝王国政府停止对寮国战斗部队重新集结区进行军事渗入，停止对寮国战斗部队进行一切武装攻击，以及把它目前驻在芒奔的武装部队撤出桑怒省。
