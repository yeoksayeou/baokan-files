Fujian, Zhejiang, Rehe and other provinces, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and other cities, have properly resettled most of the demobilized construction soldiers. Many demobilized construction soldiers have become model figures and backbones in production and construction posts.

More than 11,000 demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Zhejiang Province this spring have all been properly resettled. The vast majority of them have joined agricultural production, and some have been introduced to work in factories and government agencies. Ninety-two percent of the demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Fujian Province have been properly resettled; among those who have been resettled, 85 percent have joined agricultural production. Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Transfer and Construction Committee has frequently received letters from government agencies, factories, enterprises and other departments actively requesting to receive demobilized construction soldiers. All demobilized construction soldiers who arrived in Wuhan before June 15 this year, except for a small number of people who have not yet been introduced to work, have been properly resettled. In order to cultivate employment conditions for demobilized construction soldiers, the Beijing Municipal Transfer and Construction Committee signed a "guaranteed training and employment" contract with the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative General Society in early April to train 400 accounting personnel in batches. The first batch of more than 170 people has already started studying. In the first half of this year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee systematically transferred more than 3,000 demobilized construction soldiers to various production and construction posts. Some factories and enterprises also opened technical training classes to help demobilized construction soldiers learn technology.

Demobilized construction soldiers returning to various places have played an active role in production and construction posts, and many have become model figures and backbones. Yao Junqing and Yuan Zhensheng, demobilized construction soldiers and Communist Party members who returned to Guozhangzi Village, Lingyuan County, Rehe Province, quickly joined the agricultural production cooperative. They also publicized the Party's policies to the members and enhanced their confidence in taking the road of cooperation. Now, Yao Junqing has been elected as the Party branch secretary and cooperative committee member in the village, and Yuan Zhensheng has also been elected as a member of the Party branch committee. Among the 1,002 demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Yongding, Shanghang, Liancheng and Longyan counties in Fujian Province, 671 were promoted and elected as district, township staff members and leaders of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Not long after demobilized construction soldier Rao Jiaxiang returned to Chenpu Township, Wuping County, Fujian Province, he led local farmers in building water conservancy projects and built a water conservancy project that could irrigate more than 100 mu of paddy fields. Rao Jiaxiang also actively led farmers to build mountain roads. The road construction team he led was rated as a first-class model team, and he himself was awarded first-class merit twice. Many demobilized construction soldiers in Zhejiang Province also voluntarily took out their production subsidies to solve the problem of insufficient production funds for cooperatives and mutual aid groups. In Fuyang County, demobilized construction soldiers invested more than 2,900 yuan in production funds for cooperatives and mutual aid groups.

Demobilized construction soldiers returning to coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang also actively participated in local militia organizations to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in guarding the coast. On May 20, before dawn, Ye Nanshan, a demobilized construction soldier from Zhenhai Township, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, led the militia of his township to search for Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were harassing the coast. With the cooperation of militia from other townships, he captured four armed Chiang Kai-shek bandits alive. He was therefore commended by the Fujian Provincial People's Committee and the Fujian Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. (Xinhua News Agency)

    福建、浙江等地妥善安置复员建设军人
    回到福建、浙江、热河等省和北京、上海、武汉等市的复员建设军人，绝大部分都得到了妥善安置。许多复员建设军人已在生产建设岗位上成了模范人物和骨干分子。
    今年春季回到浙江省的一万一千多名复员建设军人，已经全部得到了妥善安置。其中绝大部分参加了农业生产，也有被介绍到工厂和机关工作。回到福建省的复员建设军人有百分之九十二得到了妥善安置；在已经得到安置的复员建设军人中，有百分之八十五参加农业生产。最近，武汉市转业建设委员会经常接到机关、工厂、企业等部门主动要求接收复员建设军人的来信。所有在今年六月十五日前到达武汉市的复员建设军人，除一少部分人还没有介绍工作以外，其余都已得到了妥善安置。北京市转业建设委员会为了培养复员建设军人的就业条件，在四月初和北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社订立了分批训练四百名会计人员的“保训保用”合同。第一批一百七十多人，已经开始学习。上海市人民委员会在今年上半年内有计划地把三千多名复员建设军人输送到各生产建设岗位，有些工厂企业部门还开办了技术训练班，帮助复员建设军人学习技术。
    回到各地的复员建设军人在生产建设岗位上都发挥了积极作用，许多人已成了模范人物和骨干分子。回到热河省凌源县郭杖子村的复员建设军人、共产党员姚俊卿和袁振生，很快就参加了农业生产合作社，他们还向社员宣传党的政策，提高社员走合作化道路的信心。现在，姚俊卿已在村子里被选为党支部书记和合作社社务委员，袁振生也被选为党支部委员。回到福建省永定、上杭、连城、龙岩四个县的一千零二名复员建设军人中，有六百七十一人被提拔和选举为区、乡工作人员及农业互助合作组织的领导人。复员建设军人饶嘉香回到福建省武平县陈埔乡后不久，就带领当地农民兴修水利，修好了一个可灌溉一百多亩山田的水利工程。饶嘉香还积极带领农民修建山区公路。他领导的修路小队被评为一等模范小队，他本人也立了两次一等功。浙江省很多复员建设军人还自动地把生产补助金拿出来解决合作社和互助组生产资金不足的困难。在富阳县，复员建设军人投入合作社和互助组的生产资金有二千九百多元。
    回到福建、浙江沿海地区的复员建设军人，还积极参加当地民兵组织，配合人民解放军守卫海防。福建省海澄县镇海乡的复员建设军人叶南山，在五月二十日拂晓率领本乡民兵搜索在沿海骚扰的蒋贼兵，经外乡民兵的配合，活捉了四个蒋贼武装匪徒。他因此受到了福建省人民委员会和中国人民解放军福建军区的嘉奖。　（新华社）
