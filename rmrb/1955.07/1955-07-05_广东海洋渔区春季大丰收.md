Guangdong Province's marine spring fishing season has achieved a historically rare bumper harvest. From January to the end of May this year, the province's fishing grounds harvested approximately three million dan (approx. 150,000 metric tons) of yellow croaker, hairtail, cuttlefish, etc., an increase of more than 30 percent compared to the same period in 1954. In Zhapei port, ordinary small fishing boats can catch five to six hundred jin (250-300 kg) of cuttlefish a day. In the first quarter, Jiadong port harvested more than 50,000 dan of sardinella, pomfret, yellow croaker, etc., equivalent to the total output for the entire year of 1954.

Due to the abundant fish production this spring, the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for fish products during the traditional lean fishing season from May to July has been reversed in Guangdong Province. From January to May this year, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company purchased a total of 1.78 million dan of fish products, more than double the amount for the same period in 1954; sales also increased from 750,000 dan to 1.07 million dan. Currently, the Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company still has more than 400,000 dan of fish in stock, which can guarantee the fish demand of the people throughout the province during the lean fishing season.

　  广东海洋渔区春季大丰收
    广东省海洋春季渔汛获得历史上少见的丰收。从今年一月到五月底止，全省各渔场捕获黄鱼、带鱼、墨鱼等达三百万担左右，比一九五四年同期增产百分之三十以上。闸波港一般的小钓船一天可以钓到墨鱼五、六百斤。甲子港第一季度捕获丁鱼、立鱼、黄花鱼等五万多担，等于一九五四年全年的总产量。
    由于今年春汛鱼产丰收，改变了广东省历年来五至七月份渔汛淡季期间鱼货供不应求的现象。广东省水产供销公司从今年一月到五月共收购鱼货达一百七十八万担，比一九五四年同期增加了一倍多；销售量也由七十五万担增加到一百零七万担。目前水产供销公司仍有库存鱼四十多万担，已可保证全省人民渔汛淡季期间对鱼的需求。
