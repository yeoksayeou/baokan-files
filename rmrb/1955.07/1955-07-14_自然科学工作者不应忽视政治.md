Natural Scientists Should Not Neglect Politics
Hua Luogeng

The crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have been presented to the masses with ironclad evidence! Needless to say, everyone recognizes this as a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution.

Scientific workers pursue truth, and therefore cannot tolerate anything that is contrary to truth; even less can they tolerate scoundrels who are cloaked in the guise of "truth" but harbor treachery and malice. The Hu Feng elements are precisely this kind of people; they use progress as a front to spread reactionary ideas.

Every scientific worker in the new China remembers the past experiences of science and scientists under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and also feels how fortunate we are to have the environment that enables us to achieve something today. Therefore, everyone loves our Party and our people's democratic regime, and we hate any ideas and conspiracies that help the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We must wage a resolute struggle against the Hu Feng clique! This is a struggle for our own happiness.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that while scientific workers are deeply engaged in scientific research with concentrated effort, they are also prone to neglecting politics and losing vigilance. Speaking for myself, I mistakenly thought that I did not know Hu Feng, and had never read his articles, that this was a matter for literary workers and had little to do with us natural scientists, and therefore ignored the seriousness of this issue, failing to see their anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary nature. It was not until I saw the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily" that I realized the true face of the Hu Feng elements with great indignation.

This lesson tells us that complacency can cause us to let go of those who pass off black as white, and let go of those who are plotting to undermine the people's regime that we cherish like the apple of our eye. This is incompatible with our scientific workers' adherence to the position of truth.

Do not relax our vigilance when scientific research is underway, we must constantly study Marxism-Leninism, study current affairs, and sharpen our sense of smell, so that we can more easily judge black and white, distinguish right from wrong, and not allow the enemy to undermine our revolutionary cause.

    自然科学工作者不应忽视政治
    华罗庚
    胡风反革命集团的罪行已经铁证如山地摆在群众面前了！不用多说，谁都认清了这是一个革命同反革命的斗争。
    科学工作者们所追求的是真理，所以最不能容忍的是一切反真理的事物；更不能容忍的是披了“真理”外衣，而内藏奸诈，心怀恶毒的败类。胡风分子正是这一种人，他们以进步为幌子，传播反动的思想。
    每一个新中国的科学工作者都会想到过去在蒋介石统治下科学和科学工作者的遭遇，也会感觉到今天使我们能够有所作为的环境是多么幸福。因之，大家都热爱我们的党，热爱我们的人民民主政权，任何帮助蒋介石卖国集团的思想和阴谋，都为我们所痛恨。我们必须对胡风集团作坚决的斗争！这是一个为了我们自己的幸福的斗争。
    另一方面，无可讳言的，在科学工作者深思力索，专心一致地从事科学研究工作的时候，也正是容易忽视政治、失去警惕的时候。就我自己来说，谬以为我不知胡风其人，胡风的文章从未读过，这是文艺工作者们的事情，同我们自然科学工作者不太有关系，因而忽视了这一问题的严重性，看不清他们的反马克思列宁主义，反人民，反革命的本质。直到看到“人民日报”所发表的三批材料，才万分愤慨地认识到胡风分子的嘴脸。
    这一教训告诉我们，麻痹大意会使我们放过以黑为白的人，放过阴谋破坏我们如眼珠般珍爱的人民政权的人。这是同我们科学工作者坚持真理的立场不相容的。
    不要在科学研究工作展开的时候松懈我们的警惕性，必须经常地学习马克思列宁主义，学习时事，锻炼我们的嗅觉，使我们更容易地判断黑白，分清是非，不让敌人破坏我们的革命事业。
