The Intermediate People's Court of Tongren Area, Guizhou Province, recently sentenced counter-revolutionary element Wang Xianzhang to death for sabotaging postal and telecommunications services.

Counter-revolutionary element Wang Xianzhang was from Fengxiangxi, Sixth District, Dejiang County, Guizhou Province. Before liberation, in 1934, he killed his younger sister, Wang Meifang, to prevent her from joining the Red Army. After liberation, this criminal participated in rebellions, served as a special agent for a bandit unit, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities endangering the people. Later, he infiltrated our postal and telecommunications department, serving as the director of the Fengxiangxi Postal Agency in Dejiang County. During his tenure, he massively withheld and burned letters, and stole postage from them. In 1951, this criminal burned a bundle of letters about four feet thick. In June 1954, 428 letters withheld by this criminal were found at the postal agency, about half of which were letters sent home by the Chinese People's Volunteers and letters from military families to soldiers, as well as a parcel. The counter-revolutionary crimes of this criminal Wang in sabotaging the people's postal and telecommunications services seriously damaged the credibility of the people's postal and telecommunications services, undermined the people's freedom of communication and the communication between revolutionary soldiers and their families, and brought significant losses to the state and the people.

After Wang Xianzhang's crimes were exposed, the Intermediate People's Court of Tongren Area verified the facts through trial and, in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, recently sentenced Wang Xianzhang to death and immediate execution. Local people expressed enthusiastic support for this judgment.

　　贵州省铜仁地区人民法院
　　把破坏邮电事业的罪犯王显章判处死刑
    贵州省铜仁地区中级人民法院最近判处破坏邮电事业的反革命分子王显章死刑。
    反革命分子王显章是贵州省德江县第六区枫香溪人。解放前于一九三四年为阻止其妹王梅芳参加红军而将她杀死。该犯在解放后曾参加叛乱，任某匪部特务长，进行反革命活动，危害人民。后混入我邮电部门，担任德江县枫香溪邮政代办所主任。他在任职期间，曾大量扣压和烧毁信件，并从中盗取邮资。一九五一年，该犯烧毁约四尺粗的信件一捆。一九五四年六月，在该邮政代办所查出被该犯扣压的信件即达四百二十八封，其中约有半数为中国人民志愿军寄回的家信和军属寄给军人的信件，另外还有包裹一个。该犯破坏人民邮电事业的反革命罪行，严重地破坏了人民邮电事业的信誉，破坏了人民的通讯自由和革命军人同家庭的通讯联系，给国家和人民带来了重大的损失。
    王犯显章的罪行被揭发后，经铜仁地区中级人民法院审理属实，依据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，在最近判处王犯显章死刑，立即执行。当地群众对这一判决表示热烈拥护。
