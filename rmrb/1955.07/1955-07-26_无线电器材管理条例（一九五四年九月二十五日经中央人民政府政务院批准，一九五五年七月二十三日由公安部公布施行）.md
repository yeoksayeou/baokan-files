Regulations on the Management of Radio Equipment
(Approved by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on September 25, 1954, promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Public Security on July 23, 1955)

Article 1 These regulations are formulated to strengthen the management of radio equipment, prevent counter-revolutionaries from using such equipment for sabotage, consolidate national security, and safeguard economic construction.

Article 2 The scope of radio equipment under control:

	(1) Complete radio transmitters, receivers, transceivers, and receiver-radio two-way machines (referring to superheterodyne radios equipped with beat frequency oscillators and regenerative radios capable of receiving bands other than the broadcast band (535 kHz to 1605 kHz), but those equipped with high-frequency amplification stages are considered receivers).

	(2) Complete machines with built-in high-frequency oscillating equipment (such as high-frequency electrotherapy devices, high-frequency heating devices, high-frequency water softeners, beat frequency meters, etc.) and direction finders.

	(3) All types of audio frequency amplifiers (including the amplification section of film projectors).

	(4) All transmitting tubes; receiving tubes with an output power of two watts or more (calculated based on Class A operation); receiving tubes with an output power of less than two watts but with strong transmitting capability, such as: 3A4, 30, 31, 33, 71A, etc.

	(5) All types of fixed capacitors with a DC working voltage of 1,500 volts or more.

	(6) Variable capacitors with a plate spacing (referring to the distance between the moving and fixed plates) of one millimeter or more, telegraph keys, and crystals dedicated to transmitters.

Article 3 These regulations apply to state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories and businesses that manufacture, repair, and sell radio-controlled equipment, as well as to government agencies, organizations, enterprises, schools, and individuals who possess radio-controlled equipment not for business purposes.

Article 4 The possession and use of complete radio transmitters, receivers, transceivers, and receiver-radio two-way machines are limited to state telecommunications and broadcasting institutions; radio stations established with approval in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets"; and agencies, organizations, enterprises, and specialized schools above the specialized level that genuinely require such equipment for business purposes, with simple receiving equipment registered with the local public security agency after approval by the people's government at or above the provincial (municipal) level; otherwise, any unit or individual is strictly prohibited from possessing or using them.

Article 5 Factories and businesses that manufacture, repair, and sell radio-controlled equipment must complete the following procedures with the local municipal (county) public security bureau or sub-bureau: fill out two application forms, attach three recent half-length, bareheaded photographs of the applicant, and a detailed registration form for managers, shareholders, and employees. After review and approval by the municipal (county) public security bureau, a business license will be issued, and registration must be applied for with the local industrial and commercial administrative agency to obtain a business license before business operations are permitted. The complete machines specified in Article 2, paragraph 1 are strictly prohibited from being manufactured, repaired, or sold without special permission. It is prohibited for peddlers, second-hand dealers, and stall vendors to acquire, sell, or repair radio-controlled equipment.
