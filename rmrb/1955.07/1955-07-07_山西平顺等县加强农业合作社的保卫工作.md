　　Shanxi Pingshun and Other Counties Strengthen Security Work in Agricultural Cooperatives

　　Many agricultural production cooperatives in Pingshun, Lingchuan, Xiangyuan, and Luan counties in Shanxi Province have recently learned a lesson from the counter-revolutionary sabotage of the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. They have heightened their vigilance and further improved the internal public security organizations of the cooperatives.

　　Many cooperatives have formulated security work plans and "protect the cooperative" pledges, and have strengthened supervision and management of warehouses, farm tools, livestock, and finances. When discussing this incident, agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangyuan, Pingshun, and other counties conducted an ideological education among their members to raise vigilance and combat complacency. Members of agricultural production cooperatives in Hei Hu, Hongling, and other townships in Pingshun County also assisted local public security organs in investigating and identifying more than ten landlords, rich peasants, and lawbreakers, including Feng Changchun, who had infiltrated the cooperatives to carry out sabotage activities. They have now been arrested and dealt with according to law by the public security organs. In Xiangyuan County, members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beilixin Township discovered that landlord Li Yufa had infiltrated the cooperative, gained trust by deception, usurped the position of cooperative accountant, provoked discord among cadres, divided unity within the cooperative, and embezzled more than 140 yuan of public funds. Based on Li Yufa's acts of sabotage, the members immediately reported him to the People's Government for handling. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　山西平顺等县加强农业合作社的保卫工作
    山西省平顺、陵川、襄垣、潞安等县的许多农业生产合作社，最近从反革命分子破坏金星农林畜牧生产合作社事件的教训中，提高了警惕，进一步健全了社内的治安保卫组织。
    许多合作社制定出保卫工作计划和护社公约，并加强了对仓库、农具、牲畜和财政的监督管理。襄垣、平顺等县的农业生产合作社在讨论这一事件时，向社员们进行了一次提高警惕反对麻痹的思想教育。平顺县黑虎、虹岭等乡农业生产合作社的社员，还协助当地公安机关审查出冯长春等十多个混到社里进行破坏活动的地主、富农和违法分子，现已由公安机关依法逮捕法办。襄垣县北里信乡先锋农业生产合作社的社员在检查工作中，发现地主李余发混入社内骗取信任，篡夺了合作社会计的职务，挑拨干部之间的关系，分裂社内团结，并贪污公款一百四十多元。社员们根据李余发这些破坏事实，立刻报告人民政府作了处理。（新华社）
