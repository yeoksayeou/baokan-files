Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: Li Fuchun's report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy has inspired the vast number of commanders and fighters in the various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

	On the 7th and 8th, cadres and soldiers from many organs of the Volunteer Army listened to the Central People's Broadcasting Station's broadcast of the report on the First Five-Year Plan. Shooters and athletes attending the Volunteer Army shooting and sports review also gathered in tents to listen to the broadcast despite the rain. Soldiers guarding the front lines cheered "Long live the motherland!" upon hearing the good news. Shen Zhihong, a platoon leader, Second-Class Hero, and First-Class Merit Citation recipient from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said, "The realization of the First Five-Year Plan will not only make our motherland more prosperous and strong, but also play a significant role in consolidating the national defense and accelerating the modernization of the armed forces. In the future, I will work harder to improve my skills and be a brave warrior who will always defend the motherland." Wang Qingyuan, head of the cooking squad of the Second Company of a certain unit, who had just returned from visiting his family in the motherland, said, "I saw many newly built factories, mines, and many new agricultural production cooperatives in the countryside in the motherland, all of which were established during the First Five-Year Plan. When I think of these, I feel that the task I am undertaking now is even more glorious and important."

	The soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit, whose homes are in Henan Province, were particularly excited about the Yellow River control project mentioned in the Five-Year Plan report. They said that after the completion of this project, the disaster-prone Yellow River will bring happiness to the people. In the future, we must practice strict economy, cherish the motherland's resources, and support the motherland's economic construction. Lai Pinran, a soldier from Guangxi in a certain unit, said happily, "The Li-Zhan Railway, stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, has already been opened to traffic, which is a very favorable condition for the development of our hometown's economy. I really have unspeakable joy in my heart."

	In recent days, cadres and soldiers from many Volunteer Army companies have held discussions on Li Fuchun's report. The soldiers of the Eleventh Company of a certain Volunteer Army unit, which won the title of "Second-Class Hero Company," expressed in the symposium that they would increase their vigilance a hundredfold, strictly guard their positions, and strive to study military and politics.

    志愿军指战员对五年计划感到欢欣鼓舞
    新华社平壤十二日电　李富春所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，鼓舞了中国人民志愿军各部队的广大指挥员、战斗员。
    七日和八日，志愿军许多机关的干部和战士，收听了中央人民广播电台播送的关于第一个五年计划的报告。出席志愿军射击、体育检阅大会的射手和运动员们，也冒雨聚集在帐篷里收听了这一广播。守卫在前沿阵地上的战士们听到这一喜讯后，都高呼“祖国万岁！”志愿军某部排长、二级英雄、一等功臣沈志宏说：“第一个五年建设计划的实现不但使我们祖国更加繁荣富强，同时对巩固祖国国防和加速部队的现代化建设也起着重大作用。今后我更要努力提高自己的本领，做一个永远保卫祖国的英勇战士。”刚从祖国探家归队的某部第二连炊事班长王庆元说：“我在祖国看到了许多新建的工厂、矿山和农村中许多新的农业生产合作社，这都是在第一个五年计划中建立起来的。我一想到这些，就感到自己现在担任的任务更加光荣和重大。”
    某部第三连家在河南省的战士们，对五年计划报告中提到治理黄河的工程特别感到兴奋。他们说：这一工程完成后，将使多灾的黄河为人民带来幸福。今后我们更要厉行节约、爱护祖国资财，支援祖国的经济建设。某部广西籍战士赖品然高兴地说：“第一个五年计划中规定的黎湛铁路已经通车了，这对发展我们家乡的经济是个很有利的条件。我心里真有说不出的喜欢。”
    最近几天，许多志愿军连队的干部和战士，都先后就李富春的报告进行了座谈。志愿军某部荣获“二级英雄连”称号的第十一连的战士们，在座谈会上纷纷表示要百倍提高警惕，严守阵地，努力学习军事和政治。
