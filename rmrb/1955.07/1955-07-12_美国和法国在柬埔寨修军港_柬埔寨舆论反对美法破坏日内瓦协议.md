Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: Phnom Penh Dispatch - The long-rumored project of the United States and France to build a military port in southern Cambodia has begun. The site of the military port is chosen near Phu Quoc Island at the southern end of Kompong Som Bay, not far from the originally selected Ream Naval Base. At this military port named Kompong Som, an airport will be built, and a modern highway will be constructed from there to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.

The construction of the military port and highway is the responsibility of France and the United States, respectively, in terms of engineering and expenses. American engineers responsible for building the highway, riding in jeeps and airplanes, have "gone as deep as possible" into Cambodia and completed the surveying work for the highway. The project is expected to take two dry seasons and be completed in 1957.

According to the Bangkok "Forum," in addition to building a military port and highway in Kompong Som Bay, the United States and France are also preparing to build an international airport in Phnom Penh to accommodate aircraft weighing sixty tons.

The US and French actions of undermining the Geneva Accords by openly establishing military ports in Cambodia have aroused suspicion and opposition from Cambodian public opinion. The Phnom Penh "Unity" once wrote that the Cambodian people cannot help but worry that the intention of building new ports and highways is very different from building ordinary commercial ports. Obviously, American imperialism attempts to turn Cambodia into a military base. "Unity" emphasized that the Cambodian people will never allow "putting the stove on their chest."

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press, the U.S. Department of Defense has appointed Brigadier General George R. Roan, Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics of the U.S. Army, as the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Cambodia.

Roan will be responsible for implementing the recently signed U.S.-Cambodian military aid agreement, which violates the Geneva Accords.

According to the provisions of the military agreement, this U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group will not only control the military aid provided to Cambodia, but will also be responsible for training Cambodian troops in the future.

### 美国和法国在柬埔寨修军港  柬埔寨舆论反对美法破坏日内瓦协议

    美国和法国在柬埔寨修军港
    柬埔寨舆论反对美法破坏日内瓦协议
    据新华社河内十一日电　金边消息，传说已久的美国和法国准备在柬埔寨南方修建一个军港的工程已经动工。军港的地点选定在磅逊湾南端的浮萍岛附近，离原先选定的云壤港不远。在这个定名为磅逊的军港将要建筑一个机场，从那里还要修一条通到柬埔寨的首都金边的现代化公路。
    建筑军港和公路的工程和费用分别由法国和美国负责。负责修建公路的美国工程师乘着吉普车和飞机“尽可能地深入”柬埔寨，已完成了公路的测量工作。工程预计要用两个干季，在一九五七年完成。
    据曼谷“论坛报”报道，美法除了在磅逊湾修建军港和公路以外，还准备在金边建立一个国际机场，以便可容六十吨重的飞机降落。
    美法破坏日内瓦协议公然在柬埔寨建立军港的行为，已引起了柬埔寨舆论的疑惧和反对。金边“团结报”曾经写道，柬埔寨人民不能不担心，修建新港和公路的意图是同修建平常的商港大有区别的。显然美帝国主义企图把柬埔寨变成一个军事基地。“团结报”强调指出，柬埔寨人民决不会允许把“火炉搁在自己的胸脯上”。
    新华社七日讯　据合众社华盛顿消息，美国国防部已任命国防部陆军后方勤务参谋乔治·罗多恩准将为美国驻柬埔寨军事援助顾问团团长。
    罗多恩将负责执行最近签订的美柬军事援助协定，而这个协定是违反日内瓦协议的。
    根据军事协定的规定，这个美国军事援助顾问团除了掌握向柬埔寨提供的军事援助以外，还要在将来负责训练柬埔寨的军队。
