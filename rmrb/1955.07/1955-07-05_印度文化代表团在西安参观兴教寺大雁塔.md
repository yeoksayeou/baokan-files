Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 4th: This afternoon, Chanda and his wife, along with members of the Indian Cultural Delegation, braved the rain to travel by car to Xingjiao Temple, more than 40 li outside Xi'an city, and the Great Wild Goose Pagoda in the suburbs, to visit the tomb and pagoda of the eminent Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang and the site where he translated Indian Buddhist scriptures.

At Xingjiao Temple, Chanda and his wife laid a wreath at Xuanzang's tomb. In front of the tomb, the singer Biswas and the dancer Guha recited a poem about Buddhism by the Indian literary giant Tagore. The dancer Gian Sharma took many photos with Chinese friends. Afterwards, the guests visited the entire temple. In a room behind the tomb, the distinguished guests viewed a stone tablet engraved with a portrait of Xuanzang, depicting him on his journey to India more than 1,300 years ago.

The distinguished guests arrived at the Great Wild Goose Pagoda, and they climbed all the way to the top of the seventh story, more than 60 meters high. The host introduced, "This is where Xuanzang translated scriptures after returning from India. The Indian Buddhist scriptures he brought back at that time were stored in this pagoda." In a showroom, Chanda and his wife saw records of Xuanzang's journey to India, a chronology of major events, and a list of the classics he translated.

Today, along the villages and streets the distinguished guests passed, many people came to welcome them.

　　印度文化代表团在西安参观兴教寺大雁塔
    新华社西安四日电　四日下午，钱达和他的夫人以及印度文化代表团团员们冒雨乘车到西安城外四十多里的兴教寺和市郊大雁塔，参观中国唐代名僧玄奘墓塔和翻译印度佛经的场所。
    在兴教寺，钱达和他的夫人向玄奘墓献了花圈。在墓前，歌唱家毕斯瓦斯和舞蹈家古哈朗诵了一篇印度文豪泰戈尔的关于佛教的诗篇，舞蹈家吉安·夏尔马和中国朋友合拍了许多照片。接着，客人们参观了整个寺院。在墓后的一间房子里，贵宾们观看了一块刻有玄奘像的石碑，这幅像画着玄奘在一千三百多年前去印度时的情形。
    贵宾们到了大雁塔，他们一口气登上了六十多公尺高的第七层塔顶。主人介绍说：“这里就是玄奘当年从印度归国译经的地方，他带来的印度佛经那时就收藏在这个塔内。”在一间陈列室里钱达和他的夫人看到记述玄奘到印度去的历史、大事纪和他翻译的经典要目。
    今天，在贵宾们途经的村庄和街道，到处有许多人赶来欢迎。
