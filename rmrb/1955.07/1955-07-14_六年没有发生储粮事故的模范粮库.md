    Model Grain Depot That Has Not Had a Grain Storage Accident for Six Years
    Hu Xingye
    Wuyang District Grain Depot in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, is a model grain depot that has not had a grain storage accident for six years. This grain depot has a total of fourteen warehouses, distributed in four townships: Chigang, Wuyang, Nantou, and Zhufang. These warehouses were all converted from civilian houses, ancestral halls, and old rice mill stores. The warehouse foundations are very low, the ground is often damp, and the equipment is very simple. However, the amount of grain stored in this grain depot has been increasing year by year. Last year, its annual storage volume reached more than 15.46 million jin. The sixteen staff members of the entire depot stored an average of more than 966,000 jin of grain per person. The grain depot also has three supply stations attached to it, which are responsible for supplying grain to the eighteen townships (towns) in the entire district. Every day, two or three people have to be drawn from the warehouse to do grain supply work. Last year, the late rice that was put into storage had high moisture content, and the early rice often had insects, which also increased the difficulties for the work of Wuyang District Grain Depot.
    However, it was under such difficult circumstances that the Wuyang District Grain Depot learned from the advanced experience of the insect-free granary in Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, and made extraordinary achievements in ordinary work.
    
    Leveraging Collective Strength
    The work achievements of the Wuyang District Grain Depot are based on the collective wisdom and labor enthusiasm of all staff members. Before the start of each task at the grain depot, the depot director, Yao Genshui, would explain the significance of the work to the warehouse keepers, allowing everyone to use their collective wisdom to research and develop methods to complete the task. In mid-October of last year, after the new grain was put into storage, it was discovered that the grain in some warehouses was heating up, and the warehouse keepers actively carried out ventilation work on the grain surface. The prevention and chemical warfare officer, Xiong Maolin, often led the warehouse keepers to carefully check the grain quality: measuring the grain temperature once every four days, testing the grain moisture content once every half a month, and carefully checking the grain for insect pests and the solidity of the warehouses every three days. During the inspection, they never overlooked even the dark bottom of the warehouse. After each inspection, all the warehouse keepers would hold a meeting to study the changing characteristics of grain quality and explore the changing laws of grain. When dampness or insect pests were discovered in the grain, everyone would classify the grain according to the degree of dampness and insect pests. Whenever it was a sunny day, they would turn and dry the damp grain and sift the grain with insects. After the national movement to conserve grain was launched, the slogan "Implement grain conservation in our grain storage work!" became the clear goal of the Wuyang District Grain Depot's entire staff. In March of this year, on one occasion, a strong wind suddenly blew up, and many tiles were blown off the back of the No. 4 Grain Warehouse, and it was clear that it was about to rain heavily. When Luo Guoping, a temporary worker at the grain depot, noticed this, he automatically put up a ladder, climbed onto the roof, and covered all the tiles that had been blown off by the wind as they were before. Warehouse keeper Xiong Rungen would go to the warehouse to check for leaks whenever it rained at night, and if he found any leaks, he would immediately use a wooden basin to catch the water. Thanks to everyone's efforts, the safe storage of the grain depot's grain was ensured.

      The Emergence of Insect-Free Warehouses
    In March of last year, the Wuyang District Grain Depot learned from the methods of Yuhang County in creating insect-free warehouses and thoroughly carried out grain warehouse cleaning work. Their slogan was: "Create insect-free warehouses as soon as possible, and eliminate warehouse insects and grain consumption as soon as possible!" The grain depot sent four or five people every day to thoroughly clean up garbage in the warehouse and wash and wipe the warehouse walls. Warehouse keeper Xiong Rungen often crawled into the dark and damp bottom of the warehouse, sweeping out a lot of dust. Grain depot director Yao Genshui and Wang Zhen, the head of the district grain management office, worked with the warehouse keepers to scrape the insect corpses from the warehouse seams at the bottom of the warehouse and destroy the insect nests. Warehouse keeper Zeng Xueshu's eyes were damaged by moisture during the work at the bottom of the warehouse, but he always insisted on the cleaning work at the bottom of the warehouse. After clearing the dust, insect webs, and insect corpses in the grain warehouse, they carried out insecticide work in the empty warehouse; they also used lime slurry to block the warehouse seams and insect holes in the grain warehouse, so that the insects had nowhere to hide. In this way, the appearance of all the warehouses in the entire depot was changed, and insect-free warehouses finally emerged. In October of last year, when they discovered that there were warehouse insects in the newly stored grain, they began winter insect removal work. They disguised many holes suitable for the habits of insects on wooden blocks and placed them all on the surface of the grain. Soon, they could collect a lot of grain borers, rice weevils, and other insects from the wooden blocks. The grain depot also drew two or three staff members every day to sift the grain with insects in the grain warehouse, removing many pests. Handling insect-infested grain was also an arduous task. People worked in the dusty warehouse, often sweating profusely, but no one complained. In just a few days, the entire depot sifted more than 310,000 jin of insect-infested grain, achieving the goal of "insect-free warehouses storing insect-free grain." What force supported them in enduring these hardships? Let the words of grain depot director Yao Genshui answer: "The peasants sell the grain produced by their hard work to the state, and the state entrusts us to store this grain. This is a glorious task. When we think of these things, although the work is a bit tiring, we feel happy in our hearts!"

    "This is truly an insect-free grain depot!"
    In February of this year, the Wuyang District Grain Depot began preparations for bird prevention in the grain warehouse. Warehouse keepers Huang Yousheng and Zeng Xueshu squatted in the grain warehouse they were in charge of, weaving grain warehouse bird-proof nets. Their hands were frozen purple and numb, but they breathed hot air on them and insisted on weaving. By the end of May, the Wuyang District Grain Depot had woven 2,639 square feet of bird-proof nets, covering all 31 large and small patios and 76 doors and windows of the grain warehouses under its jurisdiction with bird-proof nets. The warehouse keepers also destroyed 195 sparrow nests on the walls around the warehouse and captured 236 sparrows. In this way, they really achieved "doors with curtains, windows with nets, and patios also with net curtains for prevention," and the entire depot's grain was completely free from bird damage.
    In early June, when the staff of the grain depots in various districts of Nanchang County visited the Wuyang Grain Depot one after another, everyone gave unanimous praise to the achievements of the grain depot's grain storage work. When visiting the bird-proof patio of the No. 1 Grain Warehouse, which covers an area of more than 200 square feet, a representative of the Fushan District Grain Depot said with emotion: "I really didn't expect that a civilian house could be turned into a grain depot with such good bird-proof equipment!" Many representatives acknowledged: "This is truly an insect-free grain depot!"

    Mass Grain Protection Work
    After the autumn grain is put into storage every year, the grain depot often reports its work to the district's Party and government leading organs. The district committee and the district office also often send people to the grain depot to check the work and widely carry out propaganda and education on grain protection work to the local masses. Under the leadership of the district committee and the district office and with the assistance of the local Party branches, two grain protection committees were formed in the grain warehouse locations throughout the district. Militiamen were on duty and on guard every day to strictly prevent bad elements from sabotaging the grain warehouses.
    The staff of the grain warehouses also often visited the masses to help them solve difficult problems. Last spring plowing season, the peasant Tu Yucheng was too busy to transplant rice seedlings due to the lack of labor. Warehouse director Yao Genshui led several warehouse keepers to help him transplant rice seedlings. In July of last year, the villagers were busy with rushing to plant and harvest. One afternoon, the staff of the grain depot saw that the rice harvested by the villagers was all drying on the open space, and it was clear that it was about to rain heavily and the rice was about to get wet. They rushed to help the villagers pick up the rice and carry the rice. The villagers were very moved. The relationship between the grain depot and the masses thus became close. At night, when the masses came to the depot to protect the grain, the warehouse keepers of the grain depot also helped the masses to learn culture, read newspapers for everyone, and promptly answer some questions related to the unified purchase and sale of grain. Therefore, the masses regarded the grain warehouse as their own warehouse to protect. In February of this year, the grain depot organized four neighborhood protection teams, including Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, agricultural cooperative members, and mutual aid team members, so that the warehouse protection work was further transformed into a mass work.
    Since 1953, the local Party committee, government health departments, and local masses have all recognized the Wuyang District Grain Depot as a model of the patriotic health movement in Nanchang County. Recently, two grain warehouses with no insects, no mold, and no rat and sparrow pests, one grain warehouse with no mold, no rats, and no sparrows, and eleven grain warehouses with no mold and no sparrows have emerged in this grain depot. The entire depot has not had any accidents such as mold, theft, fire, or flooding for more than 1,900 consecutive days. At the same time, the grain storage loss of the grain depot in 1954 was also reduced to 0.0134%, which is 0.000826% less than the loss of general grain depots, which is equivalent to saving the state 4,571 jin of grain. In the first half of this year, its storage loss fell to 0.00002% of the total grain storage. Due to the creation of these model deeds, the grain depot has received continuous rewards from the Nanchang County Grain Bureau. Now, in the office of the Wuyang District Grain Depot, seven model banners and an "Insect-Free Grain Warehouse Award Certificate" issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Department are hung. These banners and award certificates represent the fruits of the hard work of these ordinary grain workers and represent their honor.

### 六年没有发生储粮事故的模范粮库

    六年没有发生储粮事故的模范粮库
    胡兴业
    江西省南昌县武阳区粮库是一个六年来没有发生储粮事故的模范粮库。这个粮库一共有十四座仓房，分布在茌港、武阳、南涂、朱坊等四个乡。这些仓房都是利用民房、祠庙和古老的米厂店房改修的，仓房地基很低，地面经常潮湿，设备都很简陋。但是这个粮库的粮食保管量却在逐年增加，去年它的全年保管量已达到一千五百四十六万多斤，全库十六个工作人员平均每人保管粮食九十六万六千多斤。粮库还附设了担负着对全区十八个乡（镇）的粮食供应任务的三个供应站，每天都要由仓库抽出两三个人去做粮食供应工作。去年入库的晚谷水份高，早谷又多有虫子，这也给武阳区粮库的工作增加了困难。
    但是武阳区粮库就是在这样的困难情况下，学习了浙江省余杭县无虫粮仓的先进经验，在平凡的工作中，做出了不平凡的成绩。
    发挥集体力量
    武阳区粮库的工作成绩是依靠全体工作人员的集体智慧和劳动热忱得来的。粮库的每项工作开始以前，粮库主任姚根水都要向保管员们说明工作的意义，让大家发挥集体智慧研究出完成任务的方法。去年十月中旬，新粮入库后，发现部分粮仓的粮食发热，保管员们积极地展开了粮面通风工作。防化员熊茂林经常带领保管员细查粮食质变情况：每隔四天测查粮食温度一次，每半月化验粮食水份一次，平时每隔三天就细查粮食虫害情况和仓房的坚固情况。在检查中，就连黑暗的仓底他们也决不放过。每当检查之后，全库保管员便开会研究粮食质量的变化特征，探求粮食的变化规律。发现有粮食潮湿或虫害的现象时，大家便按照粮食潮湿和虫害的轻重程度，进行粮食分类。一遇晴天，他们就翻晒潮粮，风筛虫粮。全国开展节约粮食运动以后，“把节约粮食贯彻到我们的保粮工作中去！”的口号，就成为武阳区粮库全体工作人员的明确的努力目标。今年三月间，有一次，突然刮起狂风，第四粮仓的后屋被风吹掉了很多瓦，眼见就要下大雨了。当粮库临时工人罗国萍发觉后，自动地搭起梯子爬上屋顶，将被风所吹掉的瓦全部盖得和原来一样。保管员熊润根，每逢夜晚天雨时，就跑到仓内去检查屋漏情形，发现有漏的地方，立即用木盆接水。由于大家的努力，保证了粮库粮食的安全保管。
      无虫仓的出现
    去年三月间，武阳区粮库学习了余杭县创造无虫粮仓的办法，深入地开展了粮仓清洁工作。他们的口号是：“早日创造无虫仓，早日消灭仓虫耗粮！”粮库每天派了四、五个人，专门在仓内彻底打扫垃圾，洗抹仓库的板壁。保管员熊润根，经常钻进黑暗、阴湿的仓底下，匍匐着扫出了很多的灰尘。粮库主任姚根水和区粮食管理所长王镇和保管员一道，在仓底剔刮仓缝内的虫尸，捣毁虫巢。保管员曾学书在仓底工作中，眼睛被湿气浸坏了，但是，他始终坚持仓底清扫工作。在清除了粮仓内的灰尘、虫网、虫尸以后，他们又进行了空仓的药剂杀虫工作；还在粮仓内用石灰浆堵塞了仓缝和虫洞，使虫子无孔可藏。这样，就改变了全库所有仓房的面貌，无虫仓终于出现了。去年十月间，当他们发觉入库新粮中有仓虫时，便开始了冬季除虫工作，在木块上伪装了很多适合虫子习性的空洞，全部摆放在粮食表面，不久，便可从木块上搜集到很多的谷蠹、米象等虫子。粮库每天还抽出了两、三个工作人员，专门在粮仓内风筛虫粮。清除了不少害虫。处理虫粮也是一项艰苦的工作，人们在仓内灰尘腾腾中工作，往往累得满头大汗，但是没有一个人叫苦。不到几天工夫，全库便风筛了虫粮三十一万多斤，达到了“无虫仓装无虫粮”的目标。是什么力量支持着他们经受了这些艰苦的呢？还是让粮库主任姚根水的话来回答吧：“农民把辛勤劳动生产出来的粮食卖给国家，国家委托我们保管这些粮食，这是一件光荣的任务。我们一想到这些，工作虽然累些，心里却是快活的！”
    “这才是个无雀粮库啦！”
    今年二月间，武阳区粮库就开始了粮仓防雀的准备工作。保管员黄有生、曾学书蹲在自己所保管的粮仓内，编织粮仓防雀网帘，双手被冻得发紫发麻，但他们用口呵着热气坚持编织工作。到五月底，武阳区粮库编织了二千六百三十九平方尺的防雀网，把所属粮仓的三十一个大、小天井、七十六个门窗统通罩上了防雀网帘。保管员们还在仓库周围的墙壁上捣毁了一百九十五个雀巢，捕捉到二百三十六只麻雀。这样，真的做到了“门有帘，窗有网，天井也有网帘防”，全库粮食彻底免除了雀害。
    六月初，当南昌县各区粮库工作人员先后到武阳粮库参观时，大家对这个粮库保粮工作的成绩给了一致的好评。在参观第一粮仓的一个面积达二百多平方尺的防雀天井时，富山区粮库一个代表感动地说：“真想不到一间民房能搞成有这样好的防雀设备的粮库！”很多代表们都公认：“这才是个无雀粮库啦！”
    群众性的护粮工作
    每当秋粮入库后，粮库经常要向区的党和政府领导机关汇报工作，区委会和区公所也经常派人到粮库检查工作，并广泛地向当地群众进行护粮工作的宣传教育。在区委会和区公所的领导和当地党支部的协助下，全区粮仓所在地组成了两个护粮委员会，天天有民兵值班放哨，严防坏分子破坏粮仓。
    粮仓的工作人员还经常到群众中去访问，帮助群众解决困难问题。去年春耕时，农民涂玉成由于劳动力少，栽禾忙不过来，仓库主任姚根水便带领几个保管员去帮他栽禾。去年七月间，乡里群众正忙着抢种抢收。一天下午粮库的工作人员看到群众割的禾尽晒在空坪上，眼见就要下大雨，禾将要被雨淋湿，他们便赶来帮助群众拾禾、挑禾，群众很受感动。粮库和群众的关系就这样密切起来了。夜晚，群众来库护粮时，粮库的保管员还帮助群众学文化，为大家读报纸，及时解答一些有关粮食统购统销的问题。因此，群众都把粮仓看成是自己的仓库来保护着。今年二月，粮库又组织了四个四邻防护小组，参加的有共产党员、青年团员、农业社员、互助组员等，使护仓工作进一步变成了群众性的工作。
    从一九五三年起，当地党委、政府卫生部门和当地群众都公认武阳区粮库是南昌县爱国卫生运动的榜样。近来，这个粮库中出现了两座无虫、无霉又无鼠雀害粮的粮仓，一座无霉、无鼠、无雀的粮仓和十一座无霉、无雀的粮仓。全库已连续一千九百多天没有发生霉烂、偷盗、火烧、水淹等事故。同时，粮库一九五四年的粮食保管损耗也降低到万分之一点三四，比一般粮库的损耗要减少万分之八点二六，等于替国家节约了粮食四千五百七十一斤。今年上半年，它的保管损耗又降到占储粮总数的十万分之二。由于创造了这些模范事迹，粮库连续得到了南昌县粮食局的奖励。现在，在武阳区粮库的办公室内，挂上了七面模范锦旗和江西省粮食厅发给的“无虫粮仓奖证”。这些锦旗和奖证代表着这些平凡的粮食工作者的辛勤劳动的成果，代表着他们的荣誉。
