Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 22nd: Indonesian public opinion believes that the current political crisis is a conspiracy carried out for the benefit of foreign colonialists against parliamentary democracy and general elections.

The editorial pointed out that the organizers of the Guatemalan incident are now coming to Indonesia from Bangkok. The editorial called on the public to remain highly vigilant and oppose any incitement.

　　"Indonesia News" said on the 22nd that some Indonesian political parties that are not supported by the people are afraid of holding general elections, and their anti-democratic actions to sabotage the general elections are in line with the colonialists' conspiracies. The newspaper also accused the actions of a group of senior army officers against the government's appointment of the army chief of staff as a violation of the principles of parliamentary democracy.

　　Jakarta's "People's Daily" on the 22nd called on the people to safeguard the principles of parliamentary democracy and oppose military dictatorship. The "People's Daily" said that the general election must be held on schedule. Anyone who tries to obstruct the general election will be strongly opposed by the people who support democracy.
