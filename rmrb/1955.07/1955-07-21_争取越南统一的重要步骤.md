An Important Step in Striving for Vietnam's Reunification

    On July 19th, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a note to the South Vietnamese authorities, suggesting that the South Vietnamese side send representatives to a consultation meeting with representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, starting from July 20th, 1955, at a location in Vietnamese territory agreed upon by both parties, in order to jointly discuss the issue of achieving national reunification through free general elections nationwide.

    This note is an important step taken by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to strive for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords, to unify Vietnam on the basis of respecting Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and to consolidate peace in Indochina. It is the third action taken by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to seek consultation and prepare for general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people fully support this action and proposal by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They are not only of direct and significant importance to peace in Indochina and Asia, but also beneficial to world peace.

    Achieving Vietnam's reunification through free general elections is not only the sacred and inviolable national and democratic right of the Vietnamese people, but also a solemn international obligation stipulated by the Geneva Accords. On this issue, there have been two different attitudes up to now. On the one hand, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam embodies the common desire and demand of the entire Vietnamese people for national reunification, strictly abides by the Geneva Accords, and has repeatedly put forward proposals to hold consultations with the South Vietnamese authorities to arrange general elections. On the other hand, the attitude of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam is not like this. They have repeatedly refused to assume the international obligations stipulated by the Geneva Accords, and opposed seeking Vietnam's reunification and independence through consultation and preparation for general elections. It is precisely because of this attitude of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that, despite repeated suggestions from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to send representatives for consultation, the date stipulated by the Geneva Accords for the start of consultations, July 20th, has passed, and consultation is still nowhere to be seen.

    Complying with and implementing all the provisions of the Geneva Accords is a major key to ensuring peace in Indochina and Asia. Carrying out consultations in accordance with this agreement to prepare for the Vietnamese general election in order to seek the national reunification of Vietnam is also the key to the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. Thanks to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's insistence on fulfilling the provisions of the agreement, and thanks to the impartial efforts of the International Commission for Vietnam, the relevant clauses of the Geneva Accords regarding military ceasefire and the re-assembly of both sides' forces in certain areas have been implemented, and the necessary prerequisites for seeking a political solution to Vietnam and Vietnam's reunification have been created. The Vietnamese people's long-standing sacred demands for the independence, unity, and territorial integrity of their motherland can be quickly realized as long as consultations and general elections are not obstructed. Ngo Dinh Diem also flaunts the so-called "national cause." If his words have even a shred of truth, he has no reason to refuse to satisfy the Vietnamese people's demands and to refuse to realize Vietnam's reunification.

    The United States government has a particularly important responsibility for promoting Vietnam's consultation and general elections. The United States solemnly declared at the Geneva Conference that it would not use threats or force to hinder the Geneva Accords. However, for the past year, the United States has been single-mindedly devoted to increasing South Vietnam's military strength, interfering in South Vietnam's internal affairs, and attempting to split Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a US military base. To this end, the United States has created civil war in South Vietnam, encouraged and directed the South Vietnamese authorities to carry out rampant terrorist suppression activities, and openly instructed the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique to oppose the Geneva Accords and undermine consultation and general elections. Dulles himself has repeatedly expressed opinions against the Vietnamese general election. It is precisely because of the United States' intentions and actions that the South Vietnamese authorities have made undermining the Geneva Accords and opposing Vietnam's reunification their main task today. Now, people have reason to believe that the key to implementing the Vietnamese general election stipulated by the Geneva Accords lies with the United States. If the Geneva Accords are undermined here, the United States must be held responsible for the serious consequences of such destructive actions.

    All countries and peoples who wish to maintain peace in Indochina have expressed deep concern about the threat of the Geneva Accords being undermined. The joint communique issued by the Soviet and Democratic Republic of Vietnam governments on July 18th emphasized: "The implementation of the clauses of the Geneva Accords regarding Vietnam is of particular significance. Their starting point is that peace in Indochina can only be consolidated after Vietnam is unified on the basis of respecting Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords." The Soviet-Vietnamese communique also specifically stated: "It is extremely important that authorized representatives from both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and South Vietnam hold consultations within the time limit stipulated by the Geneva Accords to discuss preparing for the general election to be held in July 1956 to unify Vietnam." The joint Soviet-Indian and Polish-Indian statements and the joint Sino-Vietnamese communique all specifically called upon and appealed to the relevant governments, in places where holding elections should be a prerequisite for a political solution, to strive to fully implement the provisions of the agreement. On July 18th, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office also stated: "Consultations" regarding the Vietnamese elections "should proceed as quickly as possible." All of these calls and appeals represent the unanimous wishes and demands of peace-loving people. The demands of the people must not be ignored by a few with ulterior motives.

    Today is the anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords. A year ago, peace-loving people around the world, together with peace-loving countries, fought resolutely, overcoming all obstacles and resistance, to obtain such a peaceful agreement, extinguishing the flames of war in Indochina and giving the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia the opportunity to realize their pursuit of peace, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. Now, a year later, the Geneva Accords are facing a major threat, and peace in Indochina is at a critical juncture. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that failure to comply with the Geneva Accords "in any particular place means its destruction, and such destruction may lead to disrupting the entire Geneva structure and would have very serious consequences." This is entirely in line with the actual situation. At this important juncture, all countries that respect the Geneva Accords must fulfill their obligations, overcome obstruction and destructive forces, so that Vietnam's consultation and general elections can be realized and the Geneva Accords can be fully implemented.

### 争取越南统一的重要步骤

    争取越南统一的重要步骤
    越南民主共和国政府在七月十九日照会南越当局，建议南越方面派出代表同越南民主共和国的代表按日内瓦协议的规定，自一九五五年七月二十日起，在一个越南领土上双方协议的地点举行协商会议，以便共同讨论在全国范围内通过自由普选实现国家统一的问题。
    这个照会，是越南民主共和国为了争取全部实施日内瓦协议，为了在尊重越南的独立、主权和领土完整的基础上统一越南，为了巩固印度支那和平而采取的重要步骤。它是越南民主共和国方面为根据日内瓦协议谋求协商、准备普选而作出的第三次行动。中国人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的这种行动和建议。它们不但对印度支那和亚洲和平有直接的重大意义，而且有利于世界和平。
    通过自由普选来实现越南的统一，不仅是越南人民的神圣不可侵犯的民族权利和民主权利，而且是日内瓦协议所规定的庄严的国际义务。在这个问题上，到现在为止，一直存在着两种不同的态度。一方面，越南民主共和国政府体现了越南全体人民要求全国统一的共同愿望和要求，严格遵守日内瓦协议，几次提出建议，要求同南越当局举行协商，安排普选。另一方面，南越吴庭艳集团的态度却不是这样。他们口口声声拒绝承担日内瓦协议规定的国际义务，反对经过协商，准备普选来谋求越南的统一和独立。正是由于吴庭艳集团的这种态度，所以尽管越南民主共和国再三建议双方派出代表进行协商，可是日内瓦协议规定开始协商的日期，七月二十日，已经过去了，而协商还不见踪影。
    遵守和实施日内瓦协议的全部条款，是保障印度支那和亚洲和平的重大关键。按照这个协议的规定进行协商准备越南普选，以谋越南的全国统一，又是全部实施日内瓦协议的关键。由于越南民主共和国坚持履行协议的规定，由于越南国际委员会的公正努力，现在，日内瓦协议关于军事停战、重新集结双方部队在一定地区内的有关条款，已经实施，谋求越南的政治解决和越南统一，已经有了必要的前提。越南人民长期以来，对祖国独立、统一和领土完整的神圣要求，只要协商普选不受阻挠，就可以很快实现。吴庭艳也标榜所谓“民族事业”。假如他的话有半点真实的意义，他就没有任何理由拒绝满足越南人民的这种要求，拒绝实现越南的统一。
    美国政府对于促成越南协商普选有特别重大的责任。美国曾经在日内瓦会议上郑重声明：美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害日内瓦协议。但是，一年以来，美国却专心致志地努力于增加南越的军力，干涉南越内政，力图分裂越南，把南越变成美国的军事基地。为此，美国制造南越内战，鼓励和指使南越当局肆行恐怖镇压活动，公开指使南越吴庭艳集团反对日内瓦协议，破坏协商普选。杜勒斯本人就多次发表意见，反对越南普选。正是由于美国的这种意图，这种行动，所以南越当局才把破坏日内瓦协议、反对越南统一当作他们今天的主要任务。现在，人们有理由认为实施日内瓦协议所规定的越南普选的关键就在美国身上。如果日内瓦协议在这里遭到破坏，美国就必须对这种破坏行动产生的严重后果负责。
    所有希望维护印度支那和平的国家和人民，都对日内瓦协议可能遭受破坏的威胁，表示深切的关怀。七月十八日，苏联和越南民主共和国两国政府发表的联合公报强调指出：“日内瓦协议中关于越南的条款的履行具有特别的意义。它们的出发点是：只有在根据日内瓦协议的规定，在尊重越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上统一了越南之后，印度支那的和平才能得到巩固。”苏越公报并特别声明：“越南民主共和国和越南南方双方的受权代表在日内瓦协议规定的期限内举行协商，以讨论准备在一九五六年七月举行的普选以统一越南的问题，是十分重要的。”苏印、波印联合声明和中越联合公报都特别号召和呼吁，在应以进行选举作为政治解决的先决条件的地方，有关政府应当努力促使完全实现协议的条款。七月十八日，英国外交部发言人也表示：关于越南选举的“磋商应该尽速进行”。所有这些号召和呼吁表示了爱好和平人民的一致愿望和要求。人民的要求决不能容许少数别有用心者加以忽视。
    今天是日内瓦协议签订一周年的纪念日期。一年以前，全世界爱好和平人民同爱好和平的国家一道坚决奋斗，才排除了一切的障碍和阻力，得到了这样一个和平的协议，才使印度支那熄了战火，使越南、老挝、柬埔寨的人民得到了实现他们争取和平、独立、统一和领土完整的机会。现在，一年以后，日内瓦协议正在受到重大威胁，印度支那和平面临着紧要关头。印度总理尼赫鲁说，日内瓦协议“在任何特别的地方不遵守它就意味着它的被破坏，这种破坏可能导致打乱整个日内瓦结构，而且会产生十分严重的后果。”这完全是符合于实际情况的。在这种重要关头，一切尊重日内瓦协议的国家都必须履行它们的义务，克服阻挠和破坏势力，使越南的协商普选得以实现，使日内瓦协议彻底实施。
