Xinhua News Agency, July 10th—The Proposals Examination Committee of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress held its first meeting on the 8th and began its examination work.

Among the proposals already received from deputies, many concern important issues in national construction and current work. These include severely punishing the chief culprits of the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng and his clique, strengthening the struggle against hidden counter-revolutionary elements, developing transportation construction, building water conservancy projects, strengthening the storage of grain and overcoming the phenomenon of wasting grain, strengthening scientific research, and developing livestock production in minority areas. Some of these proposals were put forward by deputies based on problems they discovered in their daily work, some were based on problems they learned about during recent inspections in various places, and some were based on requests and opinions they collected from the masses in their daily lives. In many proposals, deputies also put forward specific solutions to these problems.

The Proposals Examination Committee has divided the proposals into five groups according to their content: political and legal affairs, culture, education, and health, industry and transportation, finance and trade (including state capitalism), and agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry, to conduct a serious study of the proposals in order to put forward examination opinions.
