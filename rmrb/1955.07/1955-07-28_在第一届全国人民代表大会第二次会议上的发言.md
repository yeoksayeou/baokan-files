**Speech by Minister Liang Xi at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress**

I fully agree with the report by Vice Premier Li Fuquan on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for controlling the Yellow River's flood and developing its water resources, the report by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on the draft of the Military Service Law, and the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work of the Standing Committee. I would like to present some opinions on how to achieve the five-year plan for forestry and request the guidance of all representatives!

Forests can conserve water and soil, ensure agricultural water supply, and provide the necessary timber for industry, mining, transportation, construction, and other basic construction needs. If forestry construction cannot keep up with the development needs of industry, agriculture, and other construction projects, it will inevitably affect the overall development of the national economy. This shows that forestry construction is an indispensable and important part of the national economic development plan. However, forestry construction is a long-term and arduous task. Only by relying on the relevant regional party and government leaders and the broad masses, and by doing a good job in the following aspects, can we smoothly achieve the five-year plan for forestry.

(1) Further strengthen the protection of existing forests, especially fire prevention: Due to the insufficient forest resources in our country and the slow growth of trees, in addition to accelerating afforestation, it is more important to protect existing forests. In recent years, we have learned a serious lesson in this regard: to protect forests well, we must rely on the masses under the attention and leadership of local party and government, organize the masses, and tirelessly fight against forest fires and pests. Fire is the greatest enemy of forests. Since liberation until 1953, although forest fires have gradually decreased, in 1954 they increased again, and this spring the situation has become more severe. Some regions have paid great attention to forest fire prevention, and under the unified leadership of the party and government, forest fire prevention has been included in the rural work plan. During periods when mountain fires are likely to occur, provinces, counties, and districts in forest areas all have forest fire prevention command departments; villages and hamlets in forest areas all have forest protection teams; agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams all have forest protection small groups. Everyone, regardless of gender or age, is mobilized to implement a strict piece-by-piece responsibility system, stand guard, and supervise each other. Once a fire occurs, the leading cadres immediately lead the team to extinguish it. In these regions, the spirit of actively preventing and extinguishing fires has become a habit and custom of the local people. However, some regions are complacent and do not understand the spirit of prevention being better than firefighting. They do not supervise and inspect the forest protection organizations of the masses, allowing them to drift; some even think that private forests are not worth protecting and adopt an indifferent attitude. This is extremely wrong. The causes of fires are many, and a considerable part of them are due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements. This cannot but make the party and government in the mountainous areas pay serious attention. In the future, how to heighten vigilance and further organize the masses in the mountainous areas to eliminate all hidden enemies is a necessary and important measure that must be taken for forest fire prevention, and it should also be regarded as an aspect of the complex and long-term class struggle at present. Some fires occur due to the carelessness of the masses in burning fields and clearing land. Due to our inadequate leadership of the mass forest protection organizations, insufficient education of the masses on forest protection, and unclear instructions to the grassroots cadres on the policy of combining forest protection with the production interests of the mountainous areas, burning fields and clearing land have also become an important cause of forest fires. This is extremely inappropriate. Everyone knows that forest areas are mostly sparsely populated and have inconvenient transportation. Once a fire occurs, firefighters cannot arrive in time, often causing serious losses. Based on the experience gained over the past few years, in the future, to prevent fires, in large state-owned forest areas, in addition to relying on the people around the forest areas for protection, the state must also establish some corresponding specialized institutions for management, more importantly, build main roads, equip armed forest protection troops and police stations, and prepare horses and cars. With fire, fight fire; without fire, prevent fire. Search the mountains and forests to prevent spies. In normal times, the forest protection troops can build roads, build watchtowers, and do afforestation and renewal work. In this way, forest fire prevention outside the forest areas can be closely combined with fire prevention inside the forest areas. In the southern private forest areas, where the population is denser than in the border areas, the method of leading by circumstances and adapting to local conditions can be adopted to organize the farmers and implement forest fire prevention, and properly arrange the production in the forest areas. Winter and spring seasons should prohibit burning fields and clearing land. In places where it must be burned, specific places and times should be designated, and organized, led, and guarded burning should be conducted. In short, whether it is state-owned forests or private forests, forest protection work needs everyone to participate.

(2) Actively carry out the planning work in mountainous areas: Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the five-year plan says: "In mountainous areas, appropriate unified planning should be carried out to make the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline industries of farmers mutually complementary, develop diversified economies, and strengthen water and soil conservation work." This is very important. Only by implementing such planning can the contradictions between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry be resolved, can afforestation be promoted in mountainous areas, and can land be fully, effectively, and rationally utilized to gradually prosper the economy of mountainous areas. Based on the planning experience of counties such as Zhejiang's Kaihua, Shandong's Pingyi, and Shanxi's Pingyao, it is estimated that after two or three five-year plans, the economic development level of mountainous areas can be increased by more than two times, and the development potential will be inexhaustible.

Implementing such planning can also avoid the continuous deforestation of mountains. Recently, due to the need for increased grain production, some areas in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Zhejiang provinces are developing large-scale farmland on the mountains. If this is allowed to continue blindly and without planning, it will violate the principles of water and soil conservation and bring long-term and serious disasters to the state and the people. Because every year the mountains are cultivated, coupled with the indiscriminate felling of forests, the soil on the mountains will lose its cover, and a large amount of it will flow into rivers, silt up the rivers, and fill up the riverbeds, causing terrible disasters to the farmland in the plains. In the future, to stop the indiscriminate cultivation, in steep slopes and areas where water and soil are easily lost, strict prohibition of cultivation should be implemented. In areas suitable for cultivation, cultivation should also follow the principles of water and soil conservation, and at the same time, to combine the current interests of the masses with long-term interests, it is necessary to rationally utilize the land and appropriately divide the areas suitable for cultivation, grazing, and forestry. In summary, mountain area production planning must be implemented.

We hope that within the first five-year plan, or a little more time, except for some ethnic minority areas and sparsely populated remote mountainous areas, each province can basically complete the mountain area production planning work. In the southern private forest areas, it is also necessary to combine production planning to investigate and clarify forest resources to strengthen the leadership of private forest afforestation work. These mountain area production planning works must be led by the party and government in a unified manner, must be coordinated by relevant departments, must be carried out on the basis of developing mutual aid and cooperation, and must organize a certain amount of technical force, that is, everyone must participate.

(3) Continue to mobilize the masses to plant trees on a large scale: In recent years, various regions have relied on the masses to plant trees and have achieved great results. For example, in 1954, the area of trees planted by the masses accounted for 94.4% of the total area of trees planted in the country, and among the trees planted by the masses, cooperative afforestation accounted for 70% to 80% of the proportion. Some provinces, such as Shanxi, Anhui, and Hebei, even reached more than 90%. In the first five-year plan, 444.9 thousand hectares of economic forests and 156.2 thousand hectares of protective forests will be planted, with a total area of 601.1 thousand hectares of trees planted. We believe that with the increasing enthusiasm of the masses for socialism and patriotism and the development of mutual aid and cooperation, we can complete and even overfulfill this task.

With the development of cooperative afforestation, various cooperative afforestation organizations have been established nationwide, such as forestry mutual aid groups, forestry cooperatives, agricultural and forestry production cooperatives, or agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives. By the end of May this year, according to the statistics of 17 provinces, the total number of various cooperative afforestation organizations (not the existing timber cooperatives) has reached 182,000. We hope that the relevant regional party and government will lead these organizations more actively to further consolidate and improve them. Especially in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations in mountainous areas, afforestation work should be included in the annual production plan and ensure the completion of the tasks according to the plan. This is also a task that requires everyone to participate.

(4) Steadily promote the work of closing mountains for afforestation: Many facts have proven that closing mountains for afforestation is indeed the most effective and economical way to eliminate barren mountains and conserve water and soil. Over the past five years, various provinces have afforested many mountainous areas through this method, achieving the effects of water storage and soil conservation, and solving part of the fuel and fodder problems for the masses. For example, the Shandong's Yimeng Mountain area, Hebei's Laiyuan County, and Hangzhou's Lingyin Mountain, after planned mountain closure, the slopes are covered with weeds and young trees, and the forests are filled with fallen leaves and humus. In the past, during the rainy season, mountain floods would occur, carrying mud and sand down the mountains. Now this phenomenon has changed, and some places have restored the cultivated land that was washed away. In addition, after closing mountains for afforestation, fruits can be harvested, firewood can be collected, and in some places, oak silkworms can be raised. The benefits are numerous.

However, if the work of closing mountains for afforestation is not done well, it is easy to conflict with the current interests of the masses, and appropriate measures must be taken: (1) There must be unified leadership from the party and government, through mountain area production planning, reasonably divide the forest land, grazing land, and firewood collection areas within a village or township, and establish some necessary and simple-to-operate systems; (2) It must be decided through the township people's congress; (3) It is necessary to carry out continuous propaganda and education to make the closure of mountains for afforestation a collective cause of a village or township, and if necessary, a village or inter-village agreement should be established. This also requires everyone to participate.

(5) Strengthen the management of timber logging in private forest areas: There are many private forests in the southern regions. In recent years, farmers have indiscriminately felled trees, not only exceeding the state's procurement plan every year but also seriously affecting water and soil conservation. For example, the procurement plan for private forests in 1954 exceeded the plan by 40%. According to the repeated suggestions of Soviet experts, it is believed that the forests in the south are basically water source forests. To conserve water sources and conserve water and soil, it is currently advisable to plant more and log less. We believe this suggestion is correct. Therefore, how to limit the indiscriminate logging of farmers through state timber procurement, gradually bring private forest timber production under state planning, is one of the tasks of socialist transformation in rural areas. To achieve the above goals, the following measures must be taken:

(1) Correctly and reasonably adjust the timber prices in various regions, correct the shortcomings of being too high or too low, and use price policies to gradually guide agricultural and forestry production into state planning. (2) Publicize the state's policy of firmly protecting the labor achievements of farmers, as long as they are planted by themselves or obtained during land reform, the state will protect their ownership according to law, so that they can manage their forests with peace of mind and not indiscriminately fell trees. (3) Implement contract procurement. Various levels of party and government should, based on the timber procurement tasks assigned by the state, formulate possible production logging plans, submit them to the forest area township people's congress for discussion, and let the farmers report and discuss the logging quantities of mutual aid groups, cooperatives, and individual farmers, and not log indiscriminately. The procurement stations should, in addition to procuring according to the contract, also prepare a certain amount to procure the timber of individual farmers.

(4) The forest industry institutions and forestry administrative departments should respectively provide technical guidance to farmers in logging, manufacturing, transportation, and afforestation and renewal. (5) Banks and credit cooperatives should, through savings and loans, absorb the idle funds of farmers to engage in forestry and other production. (6) Forest area supply and marketing cooperatives should strengthen the supply of production materials and daily necessities for farmers. This also requires everyone to participate.

(6) Practice thrift and oppose waste: This issue has been seriously raised in the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuquan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Here, we have many problems, especially in the timber industry. Although the timber industry has completed the tasks for the state over the past few years and accumulated funds, the phenomenon of waste is serious. This is mainly manifested in: In logging, only good timber is logged, bad timber is not logged, mother trees are not seriously preserved, and logging sites are not cleaned up to create conditions for natural regeneration, causing great damage to forest resources. In basic construction, the standards for building houses are too high. In forest areas where flat houses can be built, some forest industry bureaus in Northeast China prefer to imitate the style of cities and build multi-story buildings and heating systems; each forest industry bureau has a hall, and some halls are decorated quite luxuriously. Although forest railways are production-oriented, some of them also have high design standards. The machines purchased have not been fully utilized. In personnel use, there are too many non-production personnel, and the phenomenon of too many people for too few jobs is serious; absenteeism is also too much. For example, the Yichun Management Bureau had 770,000 man-days of absenteeism last year, and the Harbin Management Bureau had 990,000 man-days of absenteeism last year. In timber storage, according to incomplete statistics of 15 timber yards in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, due to poor management, among the 27.2 million cubic meters of timber currently in the timber yards, 3.2 million cubic meters have deteriorated and degraded due to pests and rot. To overcome these serious waste phenomena, we are drafting a thrift plan, significantly reducing non-production personnel, and drafting new regulations to lower the standards and costs of basic construction. In the future, in addition to our strict supervision of the thrift of forestry and timber industry institutions in various places, we also hope that various levels of party and government and all representatives will strictly supervise, criticize, expose, and criticize these waste behaviors. That is to say, here, we also hope that everyone will participate. In the past few days, everyone has enthusiastically discussed the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China. Five years is a very short time in forestry. China has so many barren mountains, and trees take so long to grow. The red pines and larches in the Greater and Lesser Xing'an Mountains take 100 to 140 years to grow into large timber, and the firs south of the Yangtze River also need to be cultivated for more than 30 years before they are useful. In just five years, not much work can be done. But five years is the beginning of fifty years or a hundred years. Today, we have learned some experience, discovered boundless strength, and realized that forestry is an indispensable and important part of the overall national economic construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, from the party and government leadership organs to the masses, from the central to the local, everyone participates in the construction of forestry. I believe that we will definitely be able to complete China's first five-year plan and step onto the bright and great road of socialism.

**Speech by Representative Chen Qiyou**

I fully agree with the report by Vice Premier Li Fuquan on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, the report by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for controlling the Yellow River's flood and developing its water resources, and I am determined to strive for their realization! I agree with the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country is not only of great historical significance to our country but also of great significance to the world. Due to the reality of the first five-year plan itself, this plan is completely possible to be successfully completed. Naturally, there will be some difficulties in implementation (as pointed out by Vice Premier Li Fuquan), but under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, plus the enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese people for socialist construction and the selfless help of the Soviet Union and the support of various people's democratic countries, these difficulties can be overcome.

At the beginning of our liberation, American imperialism and other enemies of the Chinese people had placed their hopes on the crazy idea that the new China would not be able to handle its economy and collapse. But the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led us to carry out three years of economic recovery work. By 1952, our national economy had largely recovered to the highest level before the war, and some industrial sectors had even greatly exceeded it; starting from 1953, we began to implement our first five-year plan for construction. After more than two years of practice, we are now able to formulate the plan more realistically and confidently based on reality, and raise some important industrial production to a higher level. History has determined that the people will inevitably win, and what power do the imperialists and all enemies of the Chinese people have to stop the progress of history?

On the other hand, every victory of socialist construction in our country is heartily congratulated by our brother countries and all peace-loving people in the world, because our victory is also their victory; and in the process of implementing the first five-year plan for construction in our country, the active support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has also become one of the factors for our victory. We should, with the sincerest feelings, thank the Soviet Union, because it is the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union that has enabled us to take fewer detours in our construction. With the long-term selfless help of the Soviet Union, we can more confidently complete and overfulfill our construction plan.

The 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget are in line with our country's great economic construction plan. They have prepared the construction funds for us in a reasonable manner according to our construction steps and stipulated the reasonable expenditure. The 1955 budget clearly indicates the relationship between every unit of income and expenditure and every unit of labor and our national economic construction, and also clearly indicates the direction of our efforts. Completing the state budget is a step forward in the realization of our national economic plan.

In the report on the first five-year plan and the national budget and expenditure report, the issue of increasing production and practicing thrift is specially raised, which is very correct. The huge construction funds needed for socialist construction can only be accumulated from increasing production and saving. However, from past inspections, some funds have been wasted, which is unacceptable. I fully support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's opinion on punishing the behavior of embezzlement and waste. Again, in the 1955 budget, the expenditure for economic construction and social welfare is more than 75%, which strongly proves our country's sincere desire for peace. The slander and defamation of imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries are self-defeating. Finally, I would like to mention a couple of thoughts from my inspection before this meeting: First, after the release of the report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, I heard that some people doubted the increase of grain production in the agricultural sector by only 17.6% compared to 1952. They said that the population growth rate in our country is quite high, and the current grain supply situation is much less than the average rate of rich countries. Therefore, in the first five-year plan, the improvement of the lives of the vast majority of farmers is still very little. I think this view is wrong. Because the characteristic of the first five-year plan for agriculture in our country is to implement the policy of "organizing together." The first five-year plan stipulates that the number of households participating in cooperatives reaches one-third, and further develops and improves various specific forms of labor mutual aid organizations. I myself have inspected the state-owned Nankou Farm and Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative near Beijing, and from there, I learned that the income of agricultural production cooperatives is about twice that of when they were still in mutual aid groups, and the income of state-owned farms is about 70% higher than that of cooperatives due to the use of machinery. These two agricultural organizations are still very young and have some shortcomings, but after improvement, they will have greater improvements. This shows that only by gradually bringing agriculture into socialist organizations and implementing agricultural mechanization can income be increased and the lives of farmers be improved. Again, in the first five-year plan, the total value of agriculture and its sideline industries increased by 23.3%, which is not without important significance for improving the lives of farmers. Second, many representatives mentioned the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries during the group discussions, which is indeed a serious fact; in coastal areas such as Guangdong Province, because it is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, there are more cases of infiltration by American and Kuomintang spies and hidden counter-revolutionaries. During my inspection of the Qinghe Farm labor reform work, I also heard that there was a plot by a former Military Intelligence Bureau spy to organize a riot last year. Combined with the Pan Hannan and Hu Feng incidents, we deeply realize that the sabotage of the enemy is very cunning, and we cannot be complacent. To ensure that our socialist construction is not sabotaged, we must severely suppress all counter-revolutionaries and at the same time strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism to enhance political vigilance.

I am fully satisfied with the work of the Standing Committee over the past year. The comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River, which is valid for fifty years, is a rare giant project in the world. It will transform the river, which is famous for its disasters, to serve the interests of the people. This is something that can only happen in the era of Mao Zedong. I fully support this great plan. I propose that we pass the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, the work report of the Standing Committee, and the comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River.

**Speech by Representative Guo Menghe**

I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report and felt that the first five-year plan is truly great. I fully support it and will resolutely implement it.

I am a drilling worker from the Yumen Oilfield. Since 1945, I have been working there. I am very familiar with the situation in the oilfield before and after liberation. American imperialism and the Kuomintang traitor clique did not want our country to have a petroleum industry at all. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Yumen Oilfield operated for more than ten years and was still in ruins. The oilfield had only five small drilling rigs, and each rig could only drill 20 meters per day. A single oil well could drill up to a depth of 800 meters. Only six months of drilling per year. The lives of oil workers were even more miserable. The reactionaries did not treat us as human beings. Living in the Gobi Desert, eating cold rice, many workers got stomach diseases, and even if they were sick, they had no money to treat them.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the situation in the Yumen Oilfield was completely different. Now we have more than 30 large drilling rigs, and we can drill all year round. The daily drilling progress is also improving year by year, and this year we have created a new record of 372 meters per day; and we can drill wells up to 3,000 meters deep. Just in 1954, the number of wells drilled in a single year exceeded the number of wells drilled in more than ten years during the Kuomintang era. Many abandoned wells from before liberation have now been repaired and are producing oil. In the past, American technicians boasted: "Building a Daps coking furnace without three years is not possible, and without Americans is not possible." After liberation, we only took six months to build it. We workers have also become the masters of the oilfield, and our political awareness and production enthusiasm have greatly improved, and our lives have improved a lot. Now we are all working and living happily in the oil city in the Gobi Desert.

The importance of oil is known to everyone. The socialist industrialization and mechanization of agriculture in our country cannot do without oil. Currently, our oil industry is very backward, and the production is far from meeting the demand. The Yumen Oilfield is the first natural oil base in our motherland, and it bears a particularly important responsibility during the first five-year plan. We must strive to do a good job in the reconstruction and expansion, strive to find new oil fields, and increase production to produce more oil to support national construction. There is still a lot of potential in our oilfield. As long as everyone uses their brains and finds ways, it can be tapped. For example, moving a drilling rig used to take seven days, but now it only takes four days, saving the time to drill an average of more than 100 meters, and in the future, it can be shortened even more. Again, take the drilling progress as an example. Although the monthly progress has already reached 800 meters, it is still low compared to the Soviet workers using the same drilling rig to achieve a monthly progress of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, and it can still be improved. The waste in our oilfield is also quite serious. For example, when drilling, only the progress is pursued, regardless of the high cost, and the oil and materials are not cherished, and they are consumed at will. Therefore, we must practice thrift and oppose waste, saving more manpower and money for the state. The youth thrift team in our oilfield has done a good job. They spend one to two hours after work every day, and in more than a month, they have recovered 73 tons of original oil, 35 tons of waste materials, 900,000 bricks, and 10,000 cubic meters of gravel. They have set a good example for all workers.

We want to build, and the enemy will definitely try to infiltrate and sabotage. We have also discovered such incidents in our oilfield. In March, a crane's wire was cut by a counter-revolutionary. In the past, some people thought that there was nothing in the oilfield. In fact, the problem is not that simple. Complacency makes it easy for the enemy to find loopholes. We must all heighten our vigilance, be alert at all times, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries to prevent the enemy from sabotaging our cause.

I will definitely bring the spirit of this meeting back to convey it clearly to all my fellow workers and, together with all the workers, actively respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to increase production and practice thrift, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and ensure the completion of the glorious task assigned to us by the state's first five-year plan.

**Speech by Minister Qian Ying**

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and firmly support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China.

In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the first five-year plan has been implemented, and our country's industrial and agricultural production has grown rapidly. The national economy has begun to undergo significant changes, and socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved great success. The political awareness of state workers has been improved. Most of them can faithfully perform their duties, maintain close contact with the masses, maintain a frugal and plain style of work, carry forward the spirit of diligent and conscientious service to the people, and create many heroic and model deeds. This is a powerful guarantee for the realization of China's first five-year plan.

However, in the past two years of implementing socialist construction and socialist transformation, it has also been proven that class struggle is more acute, complex, and profound. This acute and complex struggle is not only manifested in the fact that domestic and foreign enemies have adopted all kinds of despicable and vicious methods to sabotage our construction, but also in the fact that feudal remnants and bourgeois ideology have been constantly infiltrating and corrupting the workers in our departments and enterprises, thereby increasing many difficulties and losses for our construction. This is something we must be vigilant about at all times.

In the past two years, various levels of supervisory organs have focused on inspecting certain serious losses and waste phenomena in some state-owned enterprises. Some departments and enterprises, due to the bureaucracy of the leadership and the irresponsibility of the workers, or the lack of planning and blind procurement, or the practice of wide use and narrow procurement, layer upon layer of increasing the plan, have caused serious material accumulation. By the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955, the supervisory organs of eight industrial departments inspected 300 enterprises, and the accumulation of materials reached 350 million yuan. Some enterprises still have not completely overcome this phenomenon. For example, the thermal power station of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant only needed 18 tons of quicklime in the second quarter of this year, but when formulating the second quarter plan, it blindly set it at 7,000 tons, which was 380 times the actual demand. This plan was approved by six people, including the station's planning, review, planning department head, supply department head, chief engineer, and station head, until it was discovered by the supply department's planning department during the review and corrected in conjunction with the supervisory room.

Some factories do not pay attention to safety equipment and maintenance work, resulting in serious accidents. For example, the No. 2 boiler of Tianjin National Cotton Mill No. 1 was found to be leaking water as early as 1951, and after repair, it still leaked occasionally. Since February this year, the leakage has increased, and by April, it leaked 1.5 tons per hour. Workers had repeatedly reported this, but the responsible personnel of the power department and the boiler workshop of the mill covered up and arbitrarily changed the maintenance plan, and did not repair it for a long time. The leadership of the mill did not check this, resulting in an explosion accident, injuring and killing 77 workers and civilians, with a direct property loss of 369,000 yuan, the entire mill stopped work for five days, reducing the production of cotton yarn by 890 pieces and cotton cloth by 20,000 pieces, affecting the completion of the yarn and cloth production plan of the Textile Industry Department in April.

Some industrial and mining enterprises pursue production value and quantity one-sidedly, neglect quality, and do not seriously implement operating procedures and learn from Soviet experience, resulting in the production of a large number of defective products, causing great losses. For example, it was recently found that the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory produced 2,800 tons of defective products in 1954, with a net loss of 152,500 yuan, and affected the production and construction of 89 sister factories and mines.

Some state-owned companies also have serious problems with the accumulation and loss of goods. In the first half of this year, the supervisory bureaus of 17 provinces and cities inspected 43 companies, and according to incomplete statistics, the accumulated goods were valued at 52,844,450 yuan. There were also 57 units where the goods were spoiled and damaged due to poor management, with a value of 545 million yuan.

The grain department also has serious problems with grain loss due to poor processing and storage management. According to the inspection of 14 county and city grain warehouses by the Liaoning Provincial Supervisory Bureau in the first half of this year, there were 100 million jin of grain with insects, and 18,000 jin of grain that was completely moldy and unfit for consumption. Some units, due to the political complacency of the leadership, neglected security and protection work, resulting in serious losses caused by bad people taking advantage of the situation. In the first three months of 1955, there were 375 cases of grain theft in Hunan Province, with 46,000 jin of grain stolen, and 52 cases of fire, with 154,500 jin of grain burned.

The causes of the above-mentioned many waste and losses are due to the fact that some institutions are not sound, the leadership is negligent in supervision and inspection; some workers have impure work styles and are seriously irresponsible; some are the result of sabotage by reactionary elements. But some people are indifferent to these situations or do not pay attention to them, and even some leaders of departments and enterprises emphasize that the work is busy and the tasks are urgent, and do not investigate the causes of many serious problems in their work, and therefore, it is not easy to discover the attacks from the enemy from all sides. In the past two years, many supervisory organs have inspected the growing phenomena of embezzlement and theft. In 1954, the supervisory rooms of eight financial and economic departments inspected and handled 5,100 embezzlement cases. Most of the embezzlers were retained personnel or newly recruited personnel, some of whom could not resist the temptation of the bourgeoisie, and some were originally from the bourgeoisie and mixed into our state-owned enterprises to steal intentionally. For example, Xu Weizhen, an embezzler from the Harbin Branch of the People's Bank of China, was originally a capitalist who mixed into our state bank and embezzled a large amount of money. From the late stage of the "Three Antis" movement in 1952 to February 1955, there were 110 instances of embezzlement of "Three Antis" refunds, totaling 26,000 yuan, and he brazenly deposited the money in the bank for two years without being discovered because he pretended to be active. He was only caught and the case was solved when he fled in fear. Again, in a supply and marketing cooperative in a certain district in Hubei Province, a merchant mixed in and became the deputy director, and then brought in eight merchants and hooligans to become cadres, embezzling and stealing, engaging in speculation, exploiting farmers, and causing great indignation among the masses.

In the past two years, various local supervisory organs have focused on inspecting the situation of cadres implementing policies in rural areas, indicating that the vast majority of rural cadres, with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, have carried out various arduous tasks such as the production increase movement, production rescue, flood prevention and drought relief, and unified purchase and sale, and have implemented the various policies of the state for the socialist transformation of agriculture. They have always led the masses with their model behavior and selfless spirit, overcome various difficulties, and fought resolutely against natural disasters and class enemies. They have also discovered counter-revolutionary elements and various criminal elements hidden in rural areas. On the one hand, they have used all kinds of tricks to sabotage our socialist transformation of agriculture, and on the other hand, they have disguised themselves as progressive and active, infiltrated mutual aid and cooperative organizations, usurped the power of the grassroots, and carried out various sabotage activities. For example, in Shandong's Zhangyang County, several bandits such as Mao Dexin usurped the power of the township, colluded with landlords, extorted and robbed, raped women, and framed township cadres, causing unrest. Again, in the 10th district of Shandong's Deqing County, the landlord and former Kuomintang soldier Zheng Qingxiang usurped the position of district head, appointed a bloodthirsty hooligan as the township head, sheltered many counter-revolutionaries, persecuted Communist Party members and cadres, and oppressed the masses. Among the lawless and disorderly elements handled by the national supervisory organs in 1954, there were 2,193 people who were engaged in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Due to the heavy workload in rural areas and the bureaucracy of some leading cadres, who do not understand the situation, only give tasks to cadres, do not clearly explain policies and methods, and do not inspect and help after the tasks are assigned, and some rural cadres have poor work styles or low policy level and lack of experience, they often only care about completing the tasks and do not know how to educate the masses, resulting in some phenomena of forced orders. We should mainly educate these cadres patiently, improve their policy and ideological level, and help them correct their shortcomings and errors. But we must strictly distinguish between those who have degenerated and committed lawless and disorderly acts, especially counter-revolutionary saboteurs. Some people, due to a lack of vigilance against the tricks of class enemies, cannot distinguish between the shortcomings and deviations of our cadres in their work and the deliberate sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, and attribute many serious problems in rural areas caused by the sabotage of the enemy to the account of rural cadres, or exaggerate the errors and shortcomings of a few cadres into the errors and shortcomings of the majority of cadres, and do not see the hard work and selfless dedication of our broad grassroots cadres, which is obviously incorrect.

The supervisory organs at all levels have suggested that the relevant competent departments improve and correct the problems exposed by the above inspections, and for those who have committed minor errors, they are ordered to reflect and correct, and for those who have committed dereliction of duty, they are punished according to discipline and law. But in the past two years, the supervisory organs at all levels still have many shortcomings in their work, and some problems have not been inspected in time, and some inspections have not been handled in time; some complex problems have not been inspected deeply and thoroughly, and sometimes events caused by the sabotage of bad elements are simply regarded as general events of lax institutions, bureaucratic leadership, and irresponsibility of workers, and therefore the problems cannot be thoroughly solved, the bad elements cannot receive the punishment they deserve, and valuable experience and lessons cannot be learned to educate the broad cadres and masses. These shortcomings should be corrected in the future.

To adapt to the requirements of the new stage of class struggle and more effectively oppose bad people and bad deeds to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, it is necessary to further strengthen state supervision, fully play the role of supervision, improve the ideological and combative nature of supervision, and under the leadership of the party committees and governments at all levels and with the assistance and support of relevant departments, rely on the broad masses to concentrate on supervising and inspecting the implementation of the economic construction plan, especially the industrial construction plan. To this end, the political, theoretical, and professional level of supervisory workers must be continuously improved, so that they have a clear and firm class stance, sharp political sensitivity, a high sense of responsibility, and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and can resolutely fight against bourgeois ideology and saboteurs; can resolutely fight against bureaucracy, extravagance and waste, embezzlement and theft, and lawlessness and disorder, to consolidate state discipline and ensure the implementation of the first five-year plan.

**Speech by Minister Huang Jing**

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuquan on the five-year plan. I would like to express some opinions on a key issue in the implementation of the five-year plan by the machinery industry—the issue of mastering new technologies.

The industrialization of the state is to gradually transition the national economy, including agriculture, to a modern technological foundation. Modern production technology is mainly the mechanization of the labor process, replacing manual production with machine production. Therefore, to transform the production technology of various economic departments, it is necessary to have a large number of new machine equipment.

In the first five-year plan, about 38% of the total basic construction investment is used to purchase machinery and equipment. In industrial investment, it accounts for about 40%, in agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy investment, it accounts for about 17%, and even in cultural and educational construction investment, it accounts for 10%. These figures show that the machinery industry bears a heavy responsibility in national construction.

The foundation of China's machinery industry is very backward. Before liberation, the machinery factories were basically engaged in repair and assembly work. Even if they manufactured, they could only make some simple and low-technology machines. After liberation, by transforming repair factories into manufacturing factories, expanding small factories into large ones, and building several new factories, the technical level and manufacturing capacity of the machinery industry have been greatly improved. For example, the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, which was formed by combining more than ten small repair workshops, initially could only manufacture simple products such as water cranes for adding water to trains and small water pumps. After several years of effort, it can now mass-produce Soviet-type universal milling machines. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which was a farm machinery factory of the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital before liberation, was only a sales outlet for surplus agricultural machinery from the United States in name, and it had never manufactured any machinery. Now it has become a factory that manufactures precision grinders. The total output value of the national machinery industry in 1954 has reached 13 times that of 1949, and nearly 2,000 new types of products have been added. At present, we can manufacture more than 70 types of new machine tools, 6,000 kW thermal power generation equipment, 10,000 kW hydropower generation equipment, medium-speed diesel engines, coking equipment, mining exploration, mining, transportation, washing, crushing, and hoisting equipment for one cubic meter of electric shovels, railway locomotives, medium-sized ships, grain combine harvesters, and pneumatic tools, rolling bearings, etc. In the next three years, we will produce and trial-manufacture more than 1,540 new varieties, including about 100 new types of machine tools, 12,000 kW thermal power generation equipment, 3 cubic meter electric shovels, 1,000 cubic meter blast furnace equipment, heavy-duty trucks, and light tractors. These facts show that the supply capacity of the machinery industry is rapidly increasing, but compared to the growth of national needs, it is still far from enough. During the first five-year plan period, the number of machines and equipment needed is only about 60% that can be supplied domestically; in terms of variety, the proportion that can be supplied is even less, and many especially large, special precision, and complex sets of equipment cannot be manufactured during the first five-year plan period. In addition, some of the products we can manufacture are still not up to standard in quality. For example, some machine tools do not meet the specified accuracy, some power machinery does not meet the required efficiency, and some factories, because the quality of the products is not good, often send people to various places to repair the products that have already been shipped. The lack of variety and poor quality are the fundamental problems of the machinery industry at present, and the main reason is our technological backwardness.

First, the technological foundation is backward. To manufacture modern machinery products, a certain level of technological equipment is required. To manufacture large products, large equipment is needed; to manufacture precision products, precision machine tools are needed. To mass-produce complex and precise products, many special equipment is needed. In recent years, although existing enterprises have added a lot of equipment, it is still difficult to manufacture especially large and special precision products. For example, a set of rolling mill equipment with 1,150 millimeters of initial rolling equipment has tens of thousands of parts, and many of these parts are large. Among them, the heaviest part weighs 80 tons, and casting and forging these parts require a large steel casting workshop and heavy forging equipment; processing these parts also requires a set of special heavy machine tools. Therefore, to produce such products in sets, new factories must be built.

Second, the technological strength is weak. Especially high-level technical personnel and high-level skilled workers are not only few in number but also incomplete in their trades. Therefore, many technical institutions that should be established cannot be established; new large factories require many engineers, and we cannot fully equip them; many technical problems in existing factories cannot be solved in time. The design of new factories and the design of products are mostly dependent on the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and we cannot yet independently carry out relatively complex designs. In terms of technology, many advanced processing methods, such as precision machining, welding, and large-scale forging, are still difficult to implement.

Third, there are still backward repair habits in production. In recent years, under the direct help of experts sent by the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, we have learned some advanced experience, and the organization and technical level of production have been greatly improved. However, in establishing a regular technological system and changing the old repair habits, the extent to which various factories have done so is very uneven. To thoroughly and universally do this work well, we still need to make great efforts. At present, some products do not have a complete set of technical documents, or even if there are technical documents, they still lack the necessary regulations and systems to ensure their implementation. Some products, although they have drawings and standards, are not strictly manufactured according to the drawings and standards, and there is a lack of unified and strict regulations for the production process, the machines, tools, materials, and operating methods that should be used, and some, although there are regulations, have not been strictly implemented. Some workers still habitually use old methods, and each master has their own set of operating methods. In terms of inspection, there is also a lack of clear inspection standards and strict systems. In this way, the parts made cannot be precise, and when assembling, they can only be adjusted by making large ones smaller and small ones larger, using the so-called "matching" and "filing, scraping, hammering, and hitting" methods to assemble them together. The machines made in this way, of course, cannot be of good quality.

The technological backwardness of the machinery industry is obviously not in line with the requirements of national economic development. Without building a powerful machinery industry, it is not possible to achieve socialist industrialization and independently develop the national economy. Therefore, the first five-year plan puts the development of heavy industry as the central link of socialist industrialization and emphasizes the development of the machinery industry, which is completely necessary. Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in the five-year plan report: Improving industrial technology level is a basic condition for completing the task of socialist industrialization. We believe this is completely correct. It is necessary to overcome the technological backwardness of the machinery industry to make the machinery industry develop strongly.

To overcome the technological backwardness of the machinery industry, efforts must be made in two aspects: on the one hand, under the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, build a batch of new modern factories to fundamentally change the backward technological foundation of the machinery industry; on the other hand, carry out technological transformation of the existing factories.

In the five-year plan, the machinery industry will build a batch of new factories, and these factories are equipped with the latest technology. After completion, they will greatly change the face of the machinery industry. This is the most important aspect of overcoming the technological backwardness of the machinery industry. After the new factories are completed, the key issue is the problem of mastering new technologies. Only by mastering new technologies can qualified products be manufactured, and the production capacity of the factory can be fully utilized to meet the requirements of the factory design. To master new technologies, first of all, various preparatory works must be done before starting production. When the various technical documents of a factory designed abroad arrive, they must be quickly organized for translation and carefully studied, and then these documents are used as the basis for various specific preparatory works. Such as personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and external cooperation. These preparatory works must be prepared in full according to the conditions specified in the technical documents before starting production. Next, trial production must be carried out: to test whether the equipment, tools, materials, etc. meet the requirements, to check various technical documents, and to educate the workers to familiarize themselves with and master the new equipment, tools, and operating methods. In the trial production, from parts to finished products, the first requirement is to make them according to the rules (to meet the quality standards), and then to make them fast (to meet the technical quotas), until all processes are mastered, and then it is considered that the new production has been completely mastered.

In the process of mastering new production, the most important thing is to strictly follow the regulations of the technical documents, and to repeatedly educate the workers that they must insist on learning new technologies, actively overcome difficulties, and not arbitrarily change the regulations, and must abide by the technological discipline. Only by cultivating such a regular production habit can a good foundation be laid for formal production in the future; if a bad root is left at this time, it will be difficult to change it later. However, we have shortcomings in this regard. In the past, we lacked a clear understanding of mastering new production, and some comrades thought that being able to produce one or two qualified products meant mastering new production. But how were these one or two qualified products made? They were made under the condition of wasting a lot of labor and materials by using irregular methods. Although these one or two finished products can barely meet the standard, they cannot be produced in batches when formally produced. The Wind Power Tool Factory, which has been put into production, once neglected this point. They did not seriously study and implement the design materials of the Soviet Union and still acted according to their old habits. Although they corrected it later, they had already taken a detour. This is a serious lesson for us. Of course, in the process of trial production, there will be situations where the requirements of the technical documents are not suitable for the specific conditions of our country, and it is necessary to make some necessary modifications, for example, some materials cannot be produced domestically for the time being, and substitute materials must be used. The method of processing and other things must also be changed accordingly. However, such modifications must not be made lightly, and they can only be changed when it is really necessary, and they must be strictly reviewed and approved.

During the first five-year plan period, the number of new factories put into production is not large, and the main reliance is still on the production of existing factories. Moreover, the cultivation of technical strength and the accumulation of technical experience also need to be undertaken by existing factories. Therefore, the technological transformation of existing factories is also an extremely important aspect of changing the technological backwardness of the machinery industry. We cannot only pay attention to the construction of new factories and neglect the transformation of existing factories.

Based on the experience of the past few years, the technological transformation of existing factories mainly involves the following aspects:

First, clarify the professional development direction of the enterprise and organize specialized production. At present, some enterprises have not determined their professional direction, or although they have a professional direction, they have not organized specialized production. Therefore, in these factories, there are many universal machines and few specialized machines, and specialized technical problems cannot be solved. The production efficiency is very low. The professional direction of the enterprise is not clear, so it cannot consider the sequence of product development in a planned manner, and therefore the technical development lacks direction. Not organizing specialized production cannot reasonably organize the production process according to the characteristics of the products, equip specialized equipment and tools, and accumulate specialized design and manufacturing experience and cultivate specialized technical personnel and workers, thus greatly hindering the improvement of the technical level. Therefore, clarifying the professional direction of the enterprise and organizing specialized production is an important prerequisite for the comprehensive technological transformation of old enterprises. The professional direction of each factory must be arranged and decided comprehensively and in detail according to the needs of the state and combined with the specific conditions of each factory. Otherwise, production and needs will not be able to adapt to each other.

Second, it is necessary to appropriately supplement the necessary equipment, tools, and experimental and inspection instruments according to the professional development direction of the enterprise; the old equipment should be fully utilized, and it should be checked and repaired to improve its efficiency and restore its precision, so that the existing enterprises can produce more and better varieties of products, and fully utilize the production capacity.

Third, it is necessary to establish a modern and regular production technical order through the trial production of new products and the technical improvement of old products. The trial production of new products must prepare drawings and necessary technical documents, and in these documents, the technical conditions of the products, the methods of processing and inspection, and the use of what equipment, tools, materials, etc. should be specified, and then the above drawings and various regulations should be tested and identified through trial production, and then formally enter production in a regular manner, and strictly implement the inspection work in production. Unqualified products cannot be shipped. Continuously produced old products should also be improved technically in the same way as new products.

In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the creation of the masses in technology and not to neglect it because it is necessary to act according to the rules. It is necessary to organize rationalization suggestions under leadership, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and solve some key problems in technology. The creation of the masses should be scientifically identified and summarized, and then promoted.

To master new technologies, it is also necessary to solve two problems:

First, cultivate technical strength. The cultivation of technical strength requires two aspects: one is training from schools. At present, the frameworks of technical schools at all levels have been established, and the number of graduates will increase year by year in the future, but the general quality is still relatively poor and needs to be improved. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop part-time education. Soviet experience proves that this is the most effective way to cultivate industrial talents. In our current situation where there are many transferred cadres, promoted workers, and new workers, part-time education is even more important.

Second, cultivate independent design capabilities and develop scientific research work. At present, the design of our factories and the design of products are mostly dependent on the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries; but we cannot rely on this indefinitely. In the future, we need to build more new factories, produce more products, and also need to carry out special designs according to the characteristics of our country's resources and special needs, which requires us to have independent design capabilities; and independent design must be based on experimental research work. Therefore, we must strengthen our ties with the research institutions of the Academy of Sciences and universities, and actively establish and strengthen the design and technological research institutions within the department, and carry out technological research work. The above are the main tasks we need to do to master new technologies. To carry out the above work, we must first fully estimate the role of the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. They not only help us design new factories, supply important equipment, train and train personnel, and provide valuable technical data, but also send their best experts to specifically guide our work, which is a very favorable condition for us to overcome technological backwardness, and we must make full use of this superior condition. Next, the mastery of new technologies cannot be carried out in isolation, but must be combined with the work of all aspects of the enterprise, especially with the improvement of management and the increase of production and savings, and the strengthening of political and ideological work, and the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, to ensure the completion of our tasks.

In our work, there are many difficulties, but we believe that as long as we follow the instructions of Chairman Mao: earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, be honest and hardworking, help and encourage each other, and be vigilant against any boasting and arrogance, we will be able to overcome the difficulties and complete the tasks assigned to us by the five-year plan.

**Speech by Representative Cai Tingkai**

I fully agree with the report by Vice Premier Li Fuquan on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan and the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

Our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy reflects the will and demands of the entire nation, is centered on the implementation of socialist industrialization, and is formulated based on the general line of the Communist Party of China in the transitional period, that is, the general task of the state in the transitional period. This is a great and unprecedented economic construction plan. This plan has been successfully implemented since 1953 and has already achieved great success and gained valuable experience in the past two years of practice, thereby further guaranteeing that our first five-year plan will definitely be completed and overfulfilled. I sincerely support this plan and will exert all my efforts to implement it.

I deeply realize that the future of our great motherland is to build a brilliant socialist society. The central task of building a socialist society must be to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the state, and the priority development of heavy industry is the central link of socialist industrialization. The first five-year plan clearly points out this correct policy and emphasizes this correct policy, which is a great help and encouragement to the people's ideological understanding. Our revolutionary teacher Lenin repeatedly instructed: "The only and true foundation for building a socialist society is one, that is, large-scale industry." It is obvious that without heavy industry, we cannot transition to socialism, and we cannot transform agriculture and the entire national economy on the basis of modern technology.

The first five-year plan also elaborates on how to solve the contradictions between small peasant economy and socialist industrialization, and how to solve the contradictions between capitalist economy and socialist economy. These explanations and regulations show that our first five-year plan is such a comprehensive and correct great economic construction plan. The implementation of this great economic construction plan marks the unlimited bright and happy future and beautiful prospect of our great motherland.

In the short three years since liberation, our great motherland has successfully completed the work of restoring the national economy, and it is on this basis of victory that we have the superior conditions to carry out large-scale economic construction. Since 1953, we have achieved many remarkable results in industrial construction, and now the reconstruction and new construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Combined Enterprise in our country are making rapid progress; the rapid increase in steel production has greatly changed the face of the steel industry. In the machinery manufacturing industry, many factories have been built or are being newly built, such as heavy machinery factories, machine tool factories, wire factories, automobile factories, locomotive factories, tractor factories, etc., all with very large construction scales. In addition, the development of coal, electricity, and petroleum industries has achieved astonishing results. For example, the Fuxin Haizhou open-pit coal mine has completely mechanized production, and an electric shovel can dig 50,000 jin of coal at a time. The 700-mile-long ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in Northeast China can fully supply the power needs of many industrial cities and factory and mine enterprises. The production of the Yumen Oilfield has increased unprecedentedly, and the production in 1953 was nearly two and a half times that of 1949. These facts show that the foundation of our country's heavy industry has gradually and steadily been established. With the development of heavy industry, our country's light industry and transportation industry have also developed accordingly. Agriculture and handicrafts have also organized and moved towards the path of cooperation. Capitalist industry and commerce have gradually moved towards state capitalism through the paths of utilization, restriction, and reform. In the commercial sector, the development of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises has guaranteed the implementation of the planned procurement and planned supply policy, ensuring market stability. Due to the rapid progress and remarkable achievements of all these construction projects, in recent years, the material and cultural lives of the people across the country have been continuously improved and improved accordingly. This is a good start for building socialism, the victory fruit of the first two years of implementing the first five-year plan, and thus has gained the unanimous trust and praise of the people across the country. At the same time, it reflects internationally that the achievements of China's economic construction and peaceful foreign policy are increasingly gaining the admiration and sympathy of the people of various countries, with increasing influence and rising international status. In recent years, I have attended the World Peace Council and the World Peace Conference many times and deeply felt that people from various countries have a correct understanding of our country day by day, and have expressed their friendship and deep and cordial tendencies in different ways. Of course, comrades and friends from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries are even more joyful and inspiring about our construction achievements.

Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in the report: "No matter what aspect of the task of our country's first five-year plan, it is very arduous. In the first five-year plan period, our country is carrying out large-scale construction work on the basis of weak productive forces, which cannot be without difficulties. Our work is very tense. In the past two years, we have overcome many difficulties and completed many arduous and complex tasks, but in the future, we will still encounter various difficulties, and the tasks will be more arduous and complex." This shows that the tasks of the next three years of work are more arduous and complex than the past two years, and the difficulties we will encounter will certainly not be few. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the situation of the first five-year plan being successfully implemented in the past two years and the achievements it has shown; we must be full of spirit and work even harder for the tasks of the next three years, and make unremitting efforts, so that we can fully complete the five-year plan. In the past two years of work, we must not avoid saying that there were some shortcomings and some mistakes. In the basic construction, especially in the non-production housing construction, there were many and serious waste phenomena. In the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy of grain, there were also some deviations, more or less. This has brought great losses to the state and the people and has added some difficulties to the implementation of the first five-year plan. However, we have discovered the shortcomings in time and corrected the shortcomings in time; we have discovered the deviations in time and also corrected the deviations in time, so that we can continuously improve and continuously advance through the methods of checking work in time and summarizing experience and lessons in time.

In early February, I went to Guangzhou and attended the second session of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress. I heard the report of the local administrative chief and also observed the facts with my own eyes. I think that the construction work in various aspects in Guangdong Province has made great progress and development in the past two years. The deviations in the treatment of overseas Chinese relatives during the land reform and the individual shortcomings in the grain procurement have also been checked and corrected, so the people of Guangdong Province are enthusiastically supportive of the measures of the local government. I hope that the working cadres in Guangdong will, in the future, further carry out the intentions of the central government, based on the regulations of the five-year plan, continue to work hard, and complete the tasks of the future work.

At the meeting, I heard Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, which pointed out that our country has achieved certain results in developing the national economy, improving people's lives, and consolidating national defense forces by realizing the 1954 budget, and the realization of the 1955 national budget will further achieve results in these aspects. Therefore, I feel that this is an exciting and inspiring report. We must ensure that, like 1954, we will successfully realize the 1955 national budget. This will be very beneficial to the completion of the tasks of the five-year plan. I fully agree with the current nationwide efforts to implement the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's instructions to practice thrift and the launch of a mass campaign against waste. Only in this way can we combine the development of production and the increase of income to ensure the complete realization of the 1955 national budget of our country, and thus also ensure the successful completion of the five-year plan, especially the 1955 annual plan.

In the progress of the great cause of socialist construction, I deeply realize that the realization of the five-year plan is a complex and acute class struggle. Domestic and foreign enemies and all counter-revolutionaries will not be willing to die and will inevitably make desperate and cunning struggles. The recent cases of American and Kuomintang spies uncovered and sentenced in Tianjin and Guangdong, as well as other cases of reactionary sectarian organizations uncovered in various places, prove that the enemy is making every effort to attack us and sabotage our construction. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is an enemy who has infiltrated into our ranks in a hidden and disguised manner. We must heighten our political vigilance, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and break through any form of sabotage by domestic and foreign enemies and counter-revolutionaries against the five-year plan. The recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory in the struggle of the people across the country against counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Our country's first five-year plan is a great plan for the development of the national economy. To ensure the realization of this great five-year plan and to ensure the completion of our country's socialist construction, we must closely unite around the Communist Party of China, faithfully accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. As Chairman Mao Zedong said:

"We are doing an extremely glorious and great business that our predecessors have never done." The people of the whole country should unite as one, unite together, and strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan!

**Speech by Representative Wang Yilun**

I fully agree with the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the conference, and I propose that the conference adopt them.

Heilongjiang Province is an important industrial and agricultural region in our country, with rich forest resources. During the first five-year plan period, it bears heavy responsibilities in basic construction, industry, agriculture, and forestry production. In recent years, although we have done some work in industrial construction and achieved certain results, there are still many shortcomings. The problems in industrial construction mentioned by Vice Premiers Li Fuquan and Li Xiannian in their reports exist in Heilongjiang Province, and the criticism of the waste phenomena in some units in Heilongjiang Province is also completely correct. In the future, we must strengthen leadership and supervision to ensure the smooth completion of the state's industrial construction tasks.

Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in the report: Overcoming the contradiction between the development of agriculture lagging far behind the development of industry is a major task of the five-year plan. We deeply feel that in the first five-year plan, Heilongjiang Province has a particularly important responsibility in agriculture. Heilongjiang Province has a vast land area, with about 97.5 million mu of cultivated land, and nearly 1 billion mu of cultivable land; the existing cultivated land has fertile soil, convenient transportation, abundant water sources, and a climate and rainfall suitable for the production of various crops, so the grain yield is abundant, and commercial grain accounts for half of the total yield; if the cultivable land is fully developed, it can increase a large amount of fertile land for the state, equivalent to the cultivated land area of Heilongjiang Province. Due to the vast land and sparse population, the cultivation is relatively rough, and the small peasant economy is still dominant, and a large area of wasteland has not been developed, so the potential of agricultural production is great. We have confidence and will ensure the victory of the agricultural production increase indicators and agricultural cooperativization indicators assigned to our province by the state in the first five-year plan and strive to overfulfill them.

The report of the five-year plan mentions the issues of agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production increase measures, and agricultural leadership, which are also the main issues of Heilongjiang Province's agriculture. After the end of the fallow period last year, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Heilongjiang Province made a great leap forward, with the number of households participating in cooperatives increasing from 7% of the total number of households to 36%. The development of the cooperativization movement is basically normal and healthy, with 95% being consolidated or can be consolidated, and the vast majority can increase production or can increase production through efforts. The main problem in the cooperativization movement at present is: the policy of voluntary mutual benefit is not fully implemented, and the interests of middle peasants are not paid enough attention to in the aspects of stock investment, horse price, rent, agricultural tools, and manure pricing; on the other hand, there are also some phenomena of excluding poor peasants; in leadership, there is a tendency to emphasize the commune and neglect the group, and the propaganda of the policies and guidelines of the cooperativization movement is not deep enough; some production cooperatives have weak cadres, and some communes have impure leadership. These shortcomings are inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leading organs, which do not understand the situation below and do not give specific instructions on policies and methods, and after the tasks are assigned, there is a lack of in-depth inspection and help, and some rural cadres have poor work styles or low policy level and lack of experience, often only care about completing the tasks and do not know how to educate the masses, resulting in some phenomena of forced orders. We should mainly educate these cadres patiently, improve their policy and ideological level, and help them correct their shortcomings and errors. But we must strictly distinguish between those who have degenerated and committed lawless and disorderly acts, especially counter-revolutionary saboteurs. Some people, due to a lack of vigilance against the tricks of class enemies, cannot distinguish between the shortcomings and deviations of our cadres in their work and the deliberate sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, and attribute many serious problems in rural areas caused by the sabotage of the enemy to the account of rural cadres, or exaggerate the errors and shortcomings of a few cadres into the errors and shortcomings of the majority of cadres, and do not see the hard work and selfless dedication of our broad grassroots cadres, which is obviously incorrect.

The supervisory organs at all levels have suggested that the relevant competent departments improve and correct the problems exposed by the above inspections, and for those who have committed minor errors, they are ordered to reflect and correct, and for those who have committed dereliction of duty, they are punished according to discipline and law. But in the past two years, the supervisory organs at all levels still have many shortcomings in their work, and some problems have not been inspected in time, and some inspections have not been handled in time; some complex problems have not been inspected deeply and thoroughly, and sometimes events caused by the sabotage of bad elements are simply regarded as general events of lax institutions, bureaucratic leadership, and irresponsibility of workers, and therefore the problems cannot be thoroughly solved, the bad elements cannot receive the punishment they deserve, and valuable experience and lessons cannot be learned to educate the broad cadres and masses. These shortcomings should be corrected in the future.

To adapt to the requirements of the new stage of class struggle and more effectively oppose bad people and bad deeds to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, it is necessary to further strengthen state supervision, fully play the role of supervision, improve the ideological and combative nature of supervision, and under the leadership of the party committees and governments at all levels and with the assistance and support of relevant departments, rely on the broad masses to concentrate on supervising and inspecting the implementation of the economic construction plan, especially the industrial construction plan. To this end, the political, theoretical, and professional level of supervisory workers must be continuously improved, so that they have a clear and firm class stance, sharp political sensitivity, a high sense of responsibility, and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and can resolutely fight against bourgeois ideology and saboteurs; can resolutely fight against bureaucracy, extravagance and waste, embezzlement and theft, and lawlessness and disorder, to consolidate state discipline and ensure the implementation of the first five-year plan.

**Speech by Representative Wang Renhe**

I fully agree with the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuquan on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, and I fully agree with the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

The five-year plan is a great program for the struggle of the whole country. We know that the figures stipulated in the five-year plan have such great significance: the first grand bridge will be built on the Yangtze River; a huge hydropower station will be established on the Yellow River; huge steel and iron combined enterprises will be built in Wuhan and Baotou; many wastelands will be reclaimed into fertile fields; we will manufacture airplanes, automobiles, tractors, locomotive engines, and various mechanical equipment by ourselves. Just as Lenin instructed, we will transition from the horse of poor peasants to the horse of huge mechanical industry. For such a great cause, our people will not hesitate to give their blood and sweat and energy. Our country is becoming more and more prosperous and strong; our people's lives are improving every year. We are very happy with the progress of socialist construction; but domestic and foreign enemies are not happy. The enemy is hostile to our cause, and their sabotage activities are crazy and cunning. At the beginning of our liberation, American imperialism and other enemies of the Chinese people had placed their hopes on the crazy idea that the new China would not be able to handle its economy and collapse. But the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led us to carry out three years of economic recovery work. By 1952, our national economy had largely recovered to the highest level before the war, and some industrial sectors had even greatly exceeded it; starting from 1953, we began to implement our first five-year plan for construction. After more than two years of practice, we are now able to formulate the plan more realistically and confidently based on reality, and raise some important industrial production to a higher level. History has determined that the people will inevitably win, and what power do the imperialists and all enemies of the Chinese people have to stop the progress of history?

On the other hand, every victory of socialist construction in our country is heartily congratulated by our brother countries and all peace-loving people in the world, because our victory is also their victory; and in the process of implementing the first five-year plan for construction in our country, the active support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has also become one of the factors for our victory. We should, with the sincerest feelings, thank the Soviet Union, because it is the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union that has enabled us to take fewer detours in our construction. With the long-term selfless help of the Soviet Union, we can more confidently complete and overfulfill our construction plan.

The 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget are in line with our country's great economic construction plan. They have prepared the construction funds for us in a reasonable manner according to our construction steps and stipulated the reasonable expenditure. The 1955 budget clearly indicates the relationship between every unit of income and expenditure and every unit of labor and our national economic construction, and also clearly indicates the direction of our efforts. Completing the state budget is a step forward in the realization of our national economic plan.

In the report on the first five-year plan and the national budget and expenditure report, the issue of increasing production and practicing thrift is specially raised, which is very correct. The huge construction funds needed for socialist construction can only be accumulated from increasing production and saving. However, from past inspections, some funds have been wasted, which is unacceptable. I fully support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's opinion on punishing the behavior of embezzlement and waste. Again, in the 1955 budget, the expenditure for economic construction and social welfare is more than 75%, which strongly proves our country's sincere desire for peace. The slander and defamation of imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries are self-defeating. Finally, I would like to mention a couple of thoughts from my inspection before this meeting: First, after the release of the report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, I heard that some people doubted the increase of grain production in the agricultural sector by only 17.6% compared to 1952. They said that the population growth rate in our country is quite high, and the current grain supply situation is much less than the average rate of rich countries. Therefore, in the first five-year plan, the improvement of the lives of the vast majority of farmers is still very little. I think this view is wrong. Because the characteristic of the first five-year plan for agriculture in our country is to implement the policy of "organizing together." The first five-year plan stipulates that the number of households participating in cooperatives reaches one-third, and further develops and improves various specific forms of labor mutual aid organizations. I myself have inspected the state-owned Nankou Farm and Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative near Beijing, and from there, I learned that the income of agricultural production cooperatives is about twice that of when they were still in mutual aid groups, and the income of state-owned farms is about 70% higher than that of cooperatives due to the use of machinery. These two agricultural organizations are still very young and have some shortcomings, but after improvement, they will have greater improvements. This shows that only by gradually bringing agriculture into socialist organizations and implementing agricultural mechanization can income be increased and the lives of farmers be improved. Again, in the first five-year plan, the total value of agriculture and its sideline industries increased by 23.3%, which is not without important significance for improving the lives of farmers. Second, many representatives mentioned the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries during the group discussions, which is indeed a serious fact; in coastal areas such as Guangdong Province, because it is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, there are more cases of infiltration by American and Kuomintang spies and hidden counter-revolutionaries. During my inspection of the Qinghe Farm labor reform work, I also heard that there was a plot by a former Military Intelligence Bureau spy to organize a riot last year. Combined with the Pan Hannan and Hu Feng incidents, we deeply realize that the sabotage of the enemy is very cunning, and we cannot be complacent. To ensure that our socialist construction is not sabotaged, we must severely suppress all counter-revolutionaries and at the same time strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism to enhance political vigilance.

I am fully satisfied with the work of the Standing Committee over the past year. The comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River, which is valid for fifty years, is a rare giant project in the world. It will transform the river, which is famous for its disasters, to serve the interests of the people. This is something that can only happen in the era of Mao Zedong. I fully support this great plan. I propose that we pass the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, the work report of the Standing Committee, and the comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th.

In places like Huangmei County's Fusheng Township, where the leadership has been usurped by counter-revolutionaries or reactionary forces, this is not an isolated incident. These places have become strongholds for counter-revolutionary activities. Incidents such as "miracle water," "fairy goddesses," riots, banditry, forcing poor tenants to commit suicide, and murdering cadres often occur in these areas. Even in relatively good townships, some natural villages are often controlled by counter-revolutionaries or reactionary elements. To ensure the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production, it is necessary to resolutely strike the enemy several more times. Strong work teams must be sent to backward townships and villages to mobilize the masses deeply and combine the transformation of backward townships with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. When selecting township and village cadres, we must pay attention to selecting those with pure class backgrounds, clean histories, socialist ideological awareness, active work, firm struggle, and strong ties with the masses; we must not be deceived by disguised counter-revolutionaries or bad elements. Counter-revolutionary element Liu Zhensheng instructed Zhang Muxiang, saying: "You can delay the work, I'll take responsibility. My affairs you know, when the time comes to change the world, I'll take responsibility." Their specific methods are that Zhang Muxiang holds a meeting, and Liu Zhensheng's "mutual aid group" gives him ten points of work. Remnant counter-revolutionaries and some reactionary landlords and rich peasants are using various methods to infiltrate party organizations, government organizations, and mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the countryside. In some places, they have already infiltrated; others use the method of "pulling them over." Some counter-revolutionaries and reactionary landlords and rich peasants let their wives, daughters, and cadres have illicit relationships or marry, give gifts, send money to bribe and corrupt cadres. Money and women are dangerous weapons used by the enemy to attack us. We must strengthen the political and ideological education of district and township cadres, raise class vigilance, purify and strengthen the party organization, and smash the enemy's plots to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

We know that on our road to progress, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties. The enemies of society and natural disasters are two sources of difficulties, and another source is the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and complacency in our work. These errors often give the enemy an advantage and create difficulties for ourselves. As long as we eliminate subjectivism, bureaucracy, and complacency, raise our political awareness, and better mobilize and unite the people to fight, all difficulties will be overcome, and the enemy's plots will be smashed. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the first five-year plan of our country will definitely be completed, and we will strive to complete it ahead of schedule and over-fulfill it. The torrent of socialist revolution will sweep away all obstacles and destroy all decaying forces. Our people will definitely build a beautiful and happy life for themselves.

Xu Jie, Vice Minister, spoke:
I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

In the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, geological work, in addition to providing the necessary mineral resources for the first five-year plan, must also prepare for the needs of the second five-year plan, and in some mineral aspects, it is necessary to consider the needs of the third five-year plan. Therefore, our geological work needs to be doubled. In terms of the percentage of geological exploration work done by the Geological Department in each year of the first five-year plan, if the total geological exploration work done in 1952 is taken as 100, then the total work done in the last year of the first five-year plan, 1957, would be 3,860, with an average annual increase of 108 percent. In simple terms, this means that the work volume should double each year. Our geological work must advance at this speed and continuously improve the quality of work in the process to meet the requirements of national economic construction.

In the first two years of the five-year plan, 1953 and 1954, the Geological Department's exploration work in submitting mineral reserves has basically completed the planned tasks for those two years; in iron, manganese, copper, lead, tin, and coal, which are the main mineral types, considerable reserves have been discovered, providing the necessary mineral raw materials and fuels for the country's steel enterprises, and establishing a new and huge mineral raw material base in non-ferrous metals. In addition to mineral exploration, in 1954, large-scale mineral surveys were organized, and some coal, chromium, molybdenum, lead, and copper minerals were found. In the two years, important river basin geological surveys and geological surveys for various water conservancy projects were also carried out, providing the necessary geological data for the design of the country's major construction projects.

The achievements of the first two years of the five-year plan are worth our satisfaction, but we must not be complacent. As mentioned earlier, to adapt to the rapid development of national construction, our annual planned work volume must double compared to the previous year. Therefore, the tasks of the last three years of the five-year plan, 1955 to 1957, are more arduous. Currently, the important mineral areas under exploration will be completed one after another, and a large number of new backup mineral areas must be found to ensure the continuous increase of mineral reserves. Coal, iron, manganese, copper, lead, and other minerals, in addition to continuing to increase reserves, must also establish new mineral raw material bases for the reasonable distribution of industrial enterprises. As for the black metals, non-ferrous metals, and other minerals necessary for industry, as well as diamonds, asbestos, etc., and phosphates, potash, etc., necessary for agriculture, some work has been done very little, and some have not yet started work, and it is necessary to actively organize forces, strengthen work, and quickly obtain reserves. The resource exploration work for natural oil and synthetic oil, undertaken by the Geological Department, has just begun and urgently needs to be strengthened. These major tasks require us to redouble our efforts in the future to complete them.

To better complete our tasks, we must vigorously solve the main problems existing at present and correct the shortcomings and errors in the work, among which the most important are the following:

First, the various links of geological work cannot adapt to each other. The mineral survey work, which is the vanguard of exploration, still cannot adapt to the progress of exploration, and thus cannot provide backup mineral areas for exploration in a timely manner. A large number of mass-reported minerals and known locations have not been widely checked, and at the same time, the regional geological surveys, which are the vanguard of surveys, have not been carried out on a large scale, resulting in mineral surveys lacking reliable geological bases and affecting the progress of surveys; large-scale and topographic surveys are far behind the needs of surveys and regional geological surveys. The situation where the various links of work do not adapt to each other will certainly seriously affect the progress and quality of work.

Second, the economic accounting perspective and planning perspective are weak, management work is not strict, and waste is serious. First of all, the various technical specifications and technical economic quotas are currently not complete and unified, and the execution of the existing specifications and quotas is not serious enough, exploration designs are not comprehensive, sometimes violate procedures, and cause rework waste; some drilling work blindly pursues quantity and neglects quality, resulting in scrapping. The design budget system, financial supervision, technical management, and production responsibility system are just beginning to be established and need to be vigorously implemented. The organization of labor and wage system still has unreasonable phenomena, and therefore the labor productivity has not been improved as expected. Basic construction has a tendency to extravagance and waste, and even some field work teams have the idea of "keeping up with the city" for temporary buildings.

Third, the learning of advanced Soviet science and experience is not enough, the technical and theoretical level is not high, and scientific research work has not been vigorously carried out, and it has not been able to play the guiding role for surveys and exploration work. In the past few years, under the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the work level has generally improved; but due to the lack of comprehensive and systematic learning of advanced Soviet experience, our current technical level and theoretical level still cannot meet the increasing requirements of national construction.

Fourth, political and ideological work is weak. The ideological education of a large number of workers and technical personnel has not been deepened, the resourceful individualist thought style has not been strictly criticized and corrected; subjectivism and various idealist thoughts have not been fully exposed and criticized, affecting the progress of various work and the improvement of work level.

To improve the work, we must take the following measures to address the above-mentioned shortcomings in the work:

First, in addition to continuing to expand the periphery of the existing exploration areas as much as possible, we must vigorously carry out systematic mineral surveys and inspections nationwide, mobilize the masses to report minerals, and fully mobilize the forces of various provincial industrial departments and geological surveys to quickly discover a large number of oil, iron, coal, lead, phosphate, and various metal and non-metal mineral areas, and carry out exploration work to ensure the continuous increase of mineral reserves. To enable the survey work to be carried out smoothly, we must accelerate the development of regional geological surveys and large-scale and topographic surveys. At the same time, we must strengthen geophysical prospecting and engineering geology and hydrology work to make various work adapt to each other.

Second, we must vigorously carry out scientific research work, comprehensively sort out and analyze the accumulated data, combine field surveys, and seriously study the types, mineralization, and distribution laws of various minerals to play the guiding role of scientific research work for mineral surveys and exploration work.

Third, implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, further formulate and revise various technical specifications and technical economic quotas, improve the organization of labor and wage system, strengthen the design budget and economic accounting system, strictly implement financial supervision, and improve the level of management work.

Fourth, to further strengthen the geological work team, we must strengthen school education and the training of cadres in the work. At the same time, we must continue to strengthen the learning of advanced Soviet science and technology by cadres in office, and adopt methods such as cadre training classes, part-time study, and work summaries to improve professional level.

Fifth, we must seriously strengthen political and ideological work, criticize various bourgeois thought styles, establish a dialectical materialist scientific work attitude among cadres, especially among technical personnel, improve the political vigilance of cadres, and prevent the sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionaries. On the vast territory of our motherland, the geological conditions for the formation of various mineral deposits are fully present. All geological conditions for the formation of sedimentary, magmatic, and metamorphic deposits, such as the complete development of various geological age strata, various types of igneous rock bodies representing various geological age magmatic activities and crustal movements, and various geological structural forms, are widely distributed in our country. In fact, from the known mineral areas in the country, various types of metal and non-metal mineral deposits have also been found in our country. All these indicate that the mineral resources of our country are rich. Take oil as an example. In the western and southwestern regions of our country, there are vast basins, where oil seeps and layers and geological structures suitable for oil production and storage have been found everywhere; the North China Plain and the Songliao Plain in Northeast China have also found oil seeps. Although oil geology is very complex, we believe that with continued efforts in this area, we will definitely find more and larger oil-producing areas in our country. In short, the exploration work in the past few years has discovered huge mineral reserves; continued efforts in the future will open up a broader prospect for the mineral resources of our country. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and the support of the people of the whole country and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, through the unremitting efforts of all geological workers, the socialist industrialization of our country will be able to obtain powerful guarantees in terms of mineral resources.

Le Songsheng, Representative, spoke:
I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the development of the national economy's first five-year plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Law on National Service of the People's Republic of China, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The formulation of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy is an unprecedented event in our country's history. The implementation of the national economic development plan with socialist industrialization as the center is a major step to achieve the country's transitional period's overall task. Its goal is to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist society after several five-year plans. This is the unanimous wish and demand of the people of the whole country. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in the new China can we have the possibility of realizing this great plan.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important part of the implementation of the first five-year plan. Only by restricting the blind and destructive nature of capitalist economy and gradually bringing it into the national planning track can we develop the national economy according to the laws of socialist economy in a planned and proportional manner. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, Beijing has implemented the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the work of socialist transformation has achieved remarkable results. In the industrial sector, the number of public-private joint ventures increased from 9 in 1953 to 32 in 1954, and the proportion of their output value in the total industrial output value of the city increased from 3.3% to 4.96%. In 1954, the total value of the state's processing orders, purchases, and sales for private industry accounted for 71% of the total output value of private industry, up from 58.5% in 1953. Public-private joint ventures, with the socialist component in a leading position within the enterprise, have improved the enthusiasm of workers, and generally improved technology, increased varieties, improved quality, production, management, and reduced costs in various aspects. More and more people have seen the superiority of public-private joint ventures and are actively creating conditions to strive for this bright future. To improve the backwardness of private industry, in 1954, under the leadership of the government and the assistance of workers, an increase in production and reduction in waste campaign was launched in more than 300 private factories, which achieved remarkable results in improving quality, reducing costs, saving raw materials, and completing state processing orders on time, in quantity, and in quality. For example, in the city's 49 private weaving factories, after the increase in production and reduction in waste campaign was launched for more than a month, the output of grade-A products increased by 5.6%, and the number of factories that could meet the company's quality standards increased from 3 to 20, increasing the confidence of the capitalists in management. This spring, the government, according to the central government's instructions on comprehensive and balanced arrangements, arranged the production and management of private industry, helped solve the supply problems of more than 80 kinds of raw materials, adjusted the profits of 85 kinds of products, increased tasks, and improved the inspection procedures of finished products. After these measures, the production of private industry has been basically maintained, and there has been a certain profit. In the commercial sector, at the beginning of 1954, about 700 private wholesalers dealing with major commodities could no longer continue their operations due to significant changes in the market. The government, according to their requests, made proper arrangements; since 1953, the state has successively implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, and cotton cloth. Most of the private retailers in these industries have been entrusted by the state to sell or consign, and have been brought into the track of state capitalism; at the same time, other retailers have been gradually brought into the track of state capitalism in various forms such as consignment, agency, batch purchase and retail, and agency wholesale. By October 1954, 23% of the total number of private retailers in the city had been brought into the track of state capitalism. These "consignment" and "agency" private commercial enterprises, because they have been brought into the track of national economic planning, have been able to solve the problems of supply and sales channels appropriately, and the business situation is relatively stable. This spring, various relevant state-owned companies have given appropriate consideration to the supply and business volume of private commerce, implemented the policy of comprehensive and balanced arrangements, and turned around the loss-making phenomenon of some private commerce. To improve the various shortcomings of private commerce, last winter, a campaign to improve management was launched in 700 private commercial enterprises in the city, reducing waste, establishing necessary systems, and preparing for consignment and agency. Currently, the work of improving management is being further carried out in larger private commercial enterprises, with the main content being to reduce the circulation cost of commodities, follow the state plan, and change the management style.

In the process of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "There are still some capitalists who take a negative attitude towards socialist transformation. Some of them are still carrying out 'acts harmful to public interests, disrupting social economic order, and sabotaging national economic plans' prohibited by the constitution, using more cunning methods to commit 'five poisons'; some even resist or sabotage socialist transformation. Such people should be subject to public condemnation and legal punishment." We must seriously fight against these law-breaking capitalists, call on patriotic industrialists and businessmen to draw a clear line between law-abiding and law-breaking, expose and report their illegal acts, and request the government to punish them according to law.

To ensure the realization of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, private industrialists and businessmen must sincerely accept socialist transformation, love the country and the law, actively manage, study hard, and gradually walk onto various forms of state capitalism tracks; and should deeply realize that the more successful the socialist construction and socialist transformation, the more the imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries will try every means to sabotage our construction. As in the recent exposure of the counter-revolutionary activities of the Pan Hannian and Hu Feng groups, they are our enemies. Therefore, we private industrialists and businessmen should unite closely around the Communist Party of China, transform our thoughts, actively participate in the struggle to smash all hidden counter-revolutionaries, increase vigilance, overcome passivity, and not give the enemy any opportunity; increase production, practice economy, and strive for the sincere acceptance of socialist transformation and the elimination of all counter-revolutionaries and opposition to domestic and foreign enemies!

Finally, I am very excited about Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources. Hearing about the greatness and difficulty of this plan and the magnificent and beautiful prospect of comprehensive utilization, I once again deeply feel that in the era of people's democracy under Mao Zedong, it is an era of turning human ideals into reality. Due to the treatment and utilization of the Yellow River, the progress of socialist construction will be greatly promoted, benefiting human society and future generations, and changing the appearance of our great motherland. I cheer for this unprecedented great construction!

Tao Luba, Representative, spoke:
I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the meeting.

I think the speed of industrial development set by the first five-year plan in our country is correct, and I feel very encouraged. Everyone knows that "developing agriculture is the basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the overall economic plan." Now I would like to express some opinions on this issue.

I think the production increase target set for agriculture in the five-year plan is active and reliable, and it is compatible with the needs of industrial development. The investment in agriculture and the measures taken in the plan are also appropriate. Of course, to complete the agricultural production increase plan, we must make great efforts. It is wrong to underestimate the difficulties and be blindly optimistic. However, some people lack confidence in agricultural production increase, and thus doubt the development of industry. This is groundless. Judging from the situation in Shanxi Province, the conditions for completing and even over-fulfilling the agricultural production increase plan are fully available. In recent years, despite the fact that the arable land area in Shanxi Province has not changed much, the situation of grain and cotton production increase is as follows: 1952 was a year of full harvest, with a total grain production of 7.6 billion jin, an increase of 20% over 1951. The total cotton production reached 180 million jin, an increase of 67% over 1951; in 1953, the total grain production increased by 12% over 1952, but the total cotton production decreased by 15% due to the reduction of planting area, but the yield per unit area increased by 3%; in 1954, although about one-sixth of the arable land suffered serious disasters, the total grain production still increased by more than 7% over 1952 and by 29% over 1951; the total cotton production increased by 3% over 1952 and by 70% over 1951. If calculated by the total agricultural output value, 1954 increased by 13.6% over 1952. The above figures can fully illustrate that the potential of agricultural production is very great. Then, what methods have we used in the past few years to tap this potential? In summary, there are the following points: First, vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1952, the entire province had only 546 agricultural production cooperatives, with participating households accounting for 0.4% of the total number of households, and households participating in mutual aid groups accounting for about 50%. By this year, the entire province has more than 31,000 cooperatives, with cooperative households accounting for 41% of the total number of households, and households participating in mutual aid groups accounting for 76% of the total number of households. There are 16 counties that have basically achieved cooperation. Experience has proven that where cooperation is correctly developed, the effect on agricultural production increase is the most significant. For example, in Huguang County, 66.4% of the total number of households have joined cooperatives, and in 1954, the total grain production of the county increased by 18.5% over the bumper harvest year of 1952. Second, change the cultivation system, expand the replanting area, and carry out land basic construction to turn wasteland into good land. As a result, in 1954, the total crop planting area in the entire province increased by 1 million mu over 1952 and by 7.8 million mu over 1951. Third, carry out water and soil conservation and small water conservancy projects in a planned manner. In 1954, the total area of paddy fields and irrigated land in the entire province reached 6.82 million mu, an increase of 2.9 million mu over 1952. Fourth, since 1952, we have systematically summarized and promoted various high-yield experiences of crops, such as the use of new agricultural tools, improvement of cultivation techniques, expansion of the planting area of superior varieties and high-yield crops, promotion of rational dense planting and intercropping, and the launch of mass fertilizer movements, all of which have achieved great results. For example, cotton planting, due to the promotion of the advanced experience of labor model Qu Yao Li, the yield per unit area in the Jinan cotton-producing area has increased year by year since 1952, reaching 53 jin of raw cotton per mu in 1954, up from 39 jin in 1951. The county of Quwo in the Jinan area has reached 65 jin. Fifth, develop diversified economy, and promote the experience of combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy in Baisha Zhujiang Village and Yangjiaoping Village. In Shanxi Province, where more than 70% of the total area is mountainous, this is an important way to increase farmers' income and achieve agricultural production increase. The above methods have proven to be effective in practice. The problem is that so far, each method we have done is very insufficient, and there are still many shortcomings in the work we have done. But this shows that the potential for agricultural production increase is still very great. As long as we implement these methods better, plus the state's investment in agriculture and technical assistance, if there are no unexpected serious disasters, we believe that it is completely possible to strive for over-fulfilling the agricultural production increase plan.

Those who lack confidence in agricultural production increase often exaggerate the shortcomings of the grain unified purchase and sale work, and thus doubt and oppose the grain unified purchase and sale policy. On this issue, I fully agree with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech. Judging from the situation in Shanxi Province, in the past two years, due to the increase in grain production, in addition to meeting the needs of Shanxi Province, more than 5 billion jin of grain can be exported each year. This year, in May, the grain supply in some rural areas of Shanxi Province also experienced a tense situation for a while. What is the actual situation? What are the reasons? This is a problem that needs to be clarified. In late May, when the work of rectifying the unified purchase and sale in the entire province ended, we organized more than 900 party and non-party cadres to conduct a one-month investigation in 300 townships. According to the materials from these 300 townships, it is shown that the originally identified surplus households totaled 50,360, of which 3% were not supposed to be purchased but were purchased, and 9% were supposed to be purchased less but were purchased more, totaling 12%; 5% were supposed to be purchased more but were purchased less. 83% were completely reasonable. In addition, there were actually surplus households that were not identified as surplus households, accounting for about 4% of the total number of households in the 300 townships. In the 300 townships, the originally identified shortage households totaled 30,800, of which 12% were not supposed to be supplied but were supplied, 18% were supposed to be supplied less but were supplied more, 12% were supposed to be supplied more but were supplied less, and 58% were supplied reasonably. In addition, there were actually shortage households that were not identified as shortage households, accounting for about 3% of the total number of households in the 300 townships. After the rectification, the supply became reasonable, and the number of shortage households decreased by 20%, and the grain unified purchase and sale volume decreased by 23%. The above materials show that although the grain unified purchase and sale work in the past period had many problems, it was generally correct. The tense situation that once appeared in some rural areas was not caused by the state's purchase and sale indicators being too low, nor was it caused by the grain unified purchase and sale policy not being acceptable to the majority of farmers. The reasons are: on the one hand, due to the shortcomings in our work. This is mainly due to the poor understanding of the situation, the tasks arranged are not very realistic, the implementation of the policy is not deep enough, the inspection work and the correction of deviations are not timely, especially the failure to seriously pay attention to the demarcation of surplus households, self-sufficient households, and shortage households, and the demarcation of full shortage, half shortage, less shortage, and slight shortage among shortage households. The facts have proven that in 20-plus counties in Shanxi Province, due to the good work, there was basically no such tense situation. On the other hand, more importantly, some surplus households, under the influence of rich peasant thoughts and grain speculators, appeared as so-called "thought shortage households," and they were afraid of being identified as surplus households and shouted for shortage; coupled with the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements taking the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, causing trouble. In this situation, some rural leading cadres were not sober-minded, did not distinguish between true and false shortage households and enemy lines, but blindly adopted the wrong method of supplying whoever shouted the loudest; as a result, the more grain was supplied, the more people shouted for shortage, and the bad elements thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so their attacks became more rampant. Therefore, in the rectification of the grain unified purchase and sale work, we first criticized the rightist wavering sentiment among cadres, resolutely corrected the shortcomings in the work, and at the same time severely struck the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. The facts have proven that by doing this, not only the grain unified purchase and sale indicators were greatly reduced, but also the majority of farmers further clarified the benefits of the unified purchase and sale policy, and improved revolutionary vigilance, which in turn promoted the high tide of mutual aid and cooperation and the increase in production and reduction in waste movement.

The grain unified purchase and sale work is a new work, and we still lack sufficient experience. The State Council and the Central Committee's instructions on implementing the "three-definite" policy for grain have been actively supported by the majority of farmers. Of course, there will still be some deviations and problems in the future work, but if this is used to exaggerate the shortcomings in the work and doubt the grain unified purchase and sale policy, it would be completely wrong. Take an example: in April this year, due to the fact that the leading cadres of Pingyao County in Shanxi Province heard that many people were shouting for shortage and "lost their composure," the County People's Committee issued a wrong notice, stipulating that in the entire county, farmers could exchange grain, seeds, and feed for each other, and any township or individual should not interfere. After this notice was issued, the "black market" flooded in just 7-8 days, and grain prices soared, causing widespread dissatisfaction among local farmers. For example, farmer Liang Jutong said to himself while grinding flour: "Chairman Mao, will the grain unified purchase and sale policy change? It seems that the cadres below have made a mistake." Only the rich peasants and grain speculators were happy, and they smiled to people, saying: "The grain market has been liberated." The chaotic and tense situation caused by this was quickly turned around after we realized and immediately corrected it. It is obvious that this proves that doubting the grain unified purchase and sale policy and attempting to return to capitalist free trade is only beneficial to the free spread of capitalism in cities and rural areas, but it is harmful and of no benefit to the majority of farmers. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the grain unified purchase and sale policy and not waver at all. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report that the five advantages of the grain unified purchase and sale policy are completely in line with the actual situation, and we should vigorously publicize them.

Now, the imperialists, who hate the industrialization of our country, are pinning their hopes on the failure of our agriculture. However, the facts have proven and will continue to prove that the failure is not ours but theirs. Some people, due to their lack of confidence in agricultural production increase, want to use the method of reducing the speed of industrialization to develop agriculture. Obviously, this idea is completely contrary to the common wishes and actual situation of the people of our country. Therefore, we must oppose it.

This meeting, we heard Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources, and we feel very happy. The wish of the Chinese people for thousands of years to treat the water disasters of the Yellow River and the beautiful vision of developing the Yellow River's water resources have finally come true in the era of Mao Zedong. This great creation has further strengthened our confidence in the development of industry and agriculture. Undoubtedly, the people of Shanxi Province will, together with the people of other provinces along the Yellow River, fully shoulder their responsibilities according to the requirements of this plan. The practice of farmers in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province has proven that water and soil conservation is not only a fundamental measure for the treatment of the Yellow River but also the key link for the increase in agricultural production in the mountainous areas. Therefore, last August, the People's Congress of Shanxi Province passed a resolution on the comprehensive development of water and soil conservation work and formulated a 15-year plan. This year, special agencies have been established in 22 counties, and a large number of full-time cadres have been sent to carry out this work comprehensively. We are convinced that the great plan of comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River will be warmly supported and actively supported by millions of laboring people. Therefore, it will definitely succeed.

The first five-year plan, with the development of heavy industry as the center, is a program of historic significance for the construction of socialism in our country. It vividly shows us the increasingly prosperous country and the increasingly improved living standards of the people. Let us unite and, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, work hard, overcome difficulties, increase production, practice economy, and strive with confidence to complete and over-fulfill the first five-year plan. Gu Daicun, Representative, spoke:
I fully support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, the draft of the Law on National Service, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I suggest that the meeting approve them and call on the people of the whole country to resolutely fight for the completion of the first five-year plan of our country, the implementation of the state budget, the implementation of the Law on National Service, and the realization of the great plan to treat the water disasters of the Yellow River and develop the water resources of the Yellow River.

The main task of Guangdong in the first five-year plan period is to vigorously develop agricultural production with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, and at the same time, actively and plannedly develop local industries, and strengthen the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and individual handicrafts, to serve the country's socialist industrialization overall task.

Under the care and strong support of the central government, through the hard work of the people of the whole province, after the completion of land reform in the whole province, especially after the strengthening of the leadership of agricultural production by the local party committees and various levels of state organs, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production has been developed, and there has been significant development. In 1952, the total grain production reached 17.9 billion jin, exceeding the highest annual production before the war by 8%; in 1953, Guangdong's agricultural production achieved a comprehensive and bumper harvest; in 1954, due to the severe frost disaster that had not been seen in decades, the production of coarse grains was seriously reduced, but the production of rice still increased. This has fundamentally changed the grain situation in Guangdong compared to before liberation. Guangdong is no longer a grain-deficient province, but can also export a certain amount of grain to support the country's socialist industrialization. The people of the whole province, especially the 700 million people in cities, industrial areas, economic crop areas, and fishery and salt areas, whether during the new grain season or during the lean period, can guarantee to obtain grain supplies at stable prices. The people of the whole province have gradually improved their lives on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Guangdong is located in the subtropical zone, with high temperatures, sufficient rainfall, evergreen all year round, and three crops a year. These are favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production. However, uneven rainfall, severe pests, frequent typhoons, and various natural disasters have seriously threatened agricultural production increase. In just the second half of last year to the first half of this year, the entire province has been hit by water, drought, wind, pests, and frost disasters; especially last winter's severe cold, even Hainan Island froze; this spring's severe drought, after the summer solstice, there were still many paddy fields that could not be plowed. These are disasters that have not been seen in decades, resulting in the severe loss of winter crops and almost no spring plowing. Of course, disasters will increase our difficulties, but they will not make us surrender. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, with 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives and 840,000 mutual aid groups as the core, we launched a large-scale anti-drought struggle. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong stopped training for a total of six days twice to help farmers fight against drought; more than 100,000 cadres, workers, students, and staff from state organs, institutions, enterprises, and schools in the entire province participated in the anti-drought struggle; and more than 6 million farmers directly participated in the anti-drought movement. This anti-drought production army persisted for three to four months and carried out tens of thousands of river-blocking, well-digging, spring-digging, and saltwater-repelling projects. From mid-March to early May, all large and small rivers in the province, except the West River, had water flow and were blocked. The province has a total of 21,400 river-blocking projects. The largest of these was the successful completion of the sealing of the Han River project in five days, which made the Han River water, for the first time in history, stop flowing south to the sea and instead flow west to irrigate the 760,000 mu of drought-affected paddy fields in the Pingjiang Plain. The province dug 353,000 wells in the eastern, central, and western regions of Guangdong alone, solving the problem of saving seedlings and transplanting for a large number of paddy fields. The province mobilized more than 250,000 dragon-bone carts and more than 1,000 horsepower of water pumps (including 1,000 horsepower of water pumps sent by Wuhan City, Hubei Province, to support), solving the water problem for a large number of dry fields in hilly areas. Farmers in the lower reaches of the Zhujiang, Hanjiang, Rongjiang, and Jianjiang rivers adopted methods such as "blocking springs and sealing holes" and "storing fresh water and resisting salt water" to overcome the threat of seawater backflow into fields. In this way, the people of the entire province finally overcame the severe drought, transplanted more than 90% of the paddy fields before the summer solstice, completed the spring plowing production task, and immediately strengthened field management, did a good job of fertilizer application, weeding, and reasonable irrigation and drainage. The areas with good water conservancy work in the Hanjiang Plain appeared to be bumper harvests. Now the entire province has entered the busy summer harvest season, and various places have suffered severe floods, with hundreds of thousands of mu of flooded fields and more than a million disaster-stricken people, causing heavy losses. In terms of the entire province, a reduction in production in the first crop is inevitable. We deeply realize that to develop Guangdong's agricultural production, we must overcome various natural disasters. This is a very arduous task for the people of the entire province of Guangdong.

In the anti-drought production, the organizational advantages of the entire province's mutual aid and cooperation organizations were fully demonstrated, proving that once farmers are organized, they are more likely to overcome natural disasters. As the representative of the National People's Congress, Mr. Wang Han Guo, led the agricultural production cooperative, although it also suffered from a severe drought disaster, but their cooperative increased production by 14.5% on the basis of the victory of the anti-drought struggle. This proves that we must develop agricultural production with the development of mutual aid and cooperation as the center, which is completely correct.

We fully support the state's policy of concentrating the main force on the development of heavy industry during the first five-year plan period. From the situation of agricultural production development in Guangdong Province in recent years, the target of increasing agricultural and sideline production by 23.3% within five years in the first five-year plan is also completely correct. The people of Guangdong will definitely strive to complete this task and even over-fulfill it.

Since the people of Guangdong want to develop agricultural production in the first five-year plan period to serve the country's overall task of socialist industrialization, in addition to strengthening the measures for the development of agricultural production from various aspects, it is also necessary to do a good job in the unified purchase and sale of grain. This is of great significance to the socialist construction of the state and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain not only kept the grain market in Guangdong stable, ensuring the stable life of the people of the entire province, but also enabled the people of the entire province to overcome the severe frost disaster and drought disaster that had not been seen in decades. Guangdong did experience a tense situation in grain supply for a while this year, causing work losses. However, this is not, as some people say, "the grain unified purchase and sale policy is bad, it does not take care of farmers and causes tension," nor is it, as some other people say, "Guangdong's grain has not increased, but the unified purchase and sale has taken away a large amount of grain from Guangdong farmers." It should be said that the main reason for the tense situation in Guangdong's grain supply this year is that we made deviations in the implementation of the central policy and did not do a good job in the unified purchase and sale work.

Due to the fact that the grain situation in the entire province of Guangdong has been very stable for several years, and the summer purchase task was completed smoothly last year, there was a certain degree of complacency in the thinking of the provincial leadership and various levels of cadres. The summer purchase was not tightened last year, and only 30.3% of the annual task was completed, while the summer sale was left to flow freely, and 3 billion jin more were sold. Nearly 70% of the annual purchase task was concentrated in the autumn to be completed, and at the same time, to support the disaster areas across the country, additional tasks were added, and the overall purchase task was a bit heavy. However, the winter crops also encountered a severe frost disaster that had not been seen in decades, with losses of sweet potatoes and wheat equivalent to 7-8 billion jin of rice, which made the food of some farmers really not enough. Coupled with the spring drought, farmers' psychology was tense, and they hoarded grain to prepare for disasters, so the tense situation of grain supply began to appear in January this year. Although the provincial leadership had discovered this problem at that time and greatly relaxed the sale indicators, due to the cadres' "emphasis on purchase and neglect of sale" mentality, the "less supply for less shortage, no supply for no shortage" policy was not seriously implemented, but an average approach was adopted, resulting in the grain sales in January, February, and March this year, although greatly exceeding the same period last year (in February this year, the sales exceeded the same period last year by 44.47%), the problem was still not well solved. In early April, the province, on the one hand, arranged for the rectification of the sale, and on the other hand, greatly reduced the sale, trying to reverse the phenomenon of serious oversale of grain, but due to the full participation of the entire province in the anti-drought production struggle, the rectification of the sale was actually not carried out, and various places still issued the reduced indicators evenly, so from mid-April to early June, the supply work in severely disaster-stricken areas such as Maoming, Taishan, and Yangjiang in western Guangdong, and in grain-producing areas such as eastern and northern Guangdong and some mountainous areas in Hainan was indeed very tense. This is the biggest mistake in our work. It was not until late May, when the anti-drought production in the entire province was basically completed, and early June, that we had the time to mobilize 16,000 cadres to go down to the countryside to do a good job in the "three-definite" work and further rectify the grain work. Now the grain situation in Guangdong has completely eased. At the same time, it must be pointed out that even in the extremely tense situation of grain supply at that time, according to the results of the "three-definite" work investigation, it was proved that only about 10% of the rural population really lacked grain and needed to be supplied, while about 90% of the people could basically get by or even had some surplus grain, and their shouting had a great deal of falseness.

From this, it can be seen that the state's grain unified purchase and sale policy is completely correct. As for the tense situation that appeared in Guangdong's grain sale for a while, it was caused by the mistakes and shortcomings in our work. If we had not had the phenomenon of "loose in the front and tight in the back" in the grain unified purchase and sale work last year, and had grasped the grain sale work tightly from January this year, and had not adopted the method of sudden reduction in sale (it can be affirmed that if the reduction in sale method had not been adopted in April, the most that would have been oversold would have been 1 billion jin of rice, which is bearable for Guangdong's current grain situation), then the tense situation in April and May could have been completely avoided. This is a very profound lesson for the entire province of Guangdong, and we have already corrected it in conjunction with the "three-definite" work. Judging from the current situation of the first batch of townships that have completed the "three-definite" work, we have the confidence to do a good job in the grain work. The grain unified purchase and sale policy is one of the fundamental measures of the state in the transitional period, and it cannot be shaken at all. As for the shortcomings and errors in our work, they must be corrected. The current rampant sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries are worthy of our serious vigilance. We fully support the Standing Committee's decision to arrest and try the counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. Guangdong is located on the front line of national defense, and the enemy situation is serious. The people of Guangdong, who are fighting day and night against open and hidden enemies, deeply understand the seriousness of strengthening national defense forces and strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In the past year, due to our failure to grasp the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, counter-revolutionaries and various bad elements were very rampant, and the enemy's acts of murder, sabotage, rumor-mongering, and slander were endless. The proportion of criminal cases in Guangzhou City and other cities has increased significantly, seriously threatening the social order, economic construction, and the consolidation of national defense in the south of the motherland. Therefore, we must quickly correct the shortcomings in our work, unite the people of the entire province more closely, and resolutely fight against open and hidden counter-revolutionaries, eliminate them completely, consolidate the coastal and border defenses, and fight to the end for the smooth progress of the great cause of socialist construction in our great motherland!

Wang Guoxing, Representative, spoke:
During the meeting, I participated in the discussion of the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, which made me feel that its basic tasks and the center set by it, as well as the specific policies, methods, and steps for the implementation of the plan, are complete and feasible. Especially in the regulation of the progress of economic and cultural development and the training and allocation of construction personnel, it fully pays attention to the specific situation and characteristics of minority areas according to needs and possibilities, which creates important conditions for further improving the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, making me feel excited and inspired. I fully agree with and support the five-year plan and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun on the five-year economic construction, Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and I will unshakably implement them. I suggest that the meeting approve this great and complete socialist construction plan.

We, the Li and Miao people of Hainan, will never forget that before liberation, we suffered from the brutal oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and we could not even talk about industry. Even some handicraft products were brought in from other places through unequal exchange, and the entire region had no schools, almost illiterate, making us live in a state of hunger, poverty, and backwardness for a long time. Therefore, we once resisted and fought against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang with great difficulty and tenacity, and finally, through the struggle, we found the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, which enabled us to achieve complete liberation, establish a people's democratic government, and implement the system of ethnic regional autonomy. Now, we, the Li and Miao people of Hainan, and all other ethnic minorities in the country, have united and lived in the friendly and cooperative big family of our various ethnic peoples, which cannot be separated, and have gradually entered the overall track of the country's transitional period from the current development stage of the autonomous region, opening up a broad road to socialism for the future development of the Li and Miao people. Since the establishment of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region three years ago, there have been significant progress and development in politics, economy, and culture. According to the current actual needs and possible conditions, we have established power plants, oil presses, brick and tile factories, lime factories, printing factories, and grain, red and white vine processing factories, etc. In the development of agricultural production, we have implemented the socialist transformation of agriculture, gradually changing the extremely backward cultivation technology of slash-and-burn, wooden plows, and wooden harrows in the past. Many farmers have learned and adopted iron agricultural tools and pest control, and with the help of the government and the self-reliance of the masses, we have built or started to build a total of 8,266 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, reducing various natural disasters such as wind, pests, water, and drought; coupled with the steady development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the entire region has established 129 agricultural cooperatives, and the counties of Changle and Lingao have organized 32,502 households, accounting for 59.7% of the total number of households in the two counties; making grain production increase year by year. For example, in 1954, the county of Qiongzhong increased production by 19.73%, and Baoting increased production by 20%. In terms of culture and health, by the end of 1954, there were 510 primary schools, 5 secondary schools, and cultural palaces, cultural stations, film teams, and ethnic song and dance troupes, from the autonomous prefecture to the county, district, and township, a total of 261 health centers, clinics, health stations, health stations, health stations, health stations, and health stations. From last year to this year, the entire region bought more than 10,000 oxen, and now all farmers in the entire region have clothes to wear, and in Baisha Zhujiang Township, Dongpai Village, every farmer has two sets of clothes, and most of them have cotton quilts, cotton blankets, and mosquito nets. This can be said that we, the Li and Miao people of Hainan, have begun to live a healthy, happy, free, and happy life under the correct leadership and great care and help of the Party and the government. This is the victory of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, and it is also the great achievement that has been preliminarily manifested in the minority areas in the country's transitional period development plan and the implementation of the first five-year plan.

Our Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region is located in the subtropical zone, with excellent natural conditions, and crops can be harvested three times a year. In mountainous areas, there are various mineral resources and special products suitable for industrial raw materials. Wuzhishan has rich forests, and coastal areas have excellent ports that can be developed, and the fishery and salt industry have a great development prospect. With these superior objective conditions, our confidence and determination to support the industrialization of the motherland have been further strengthened. But we will not only see the favorable conditions for national construction and ignore the existence of difficulties, nor should we be complacent about the achievements we have made. We must fully pay attention to the fact that the minority areas have been in a state of extreme backwardness due to the long-term historical legacy, and we must work hard to learn, improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, and adapt to the requirements of the motherland for us. At the same time, our Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region is located on the front line of national defense. When our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, whether it is the open or hidden enemies from outside, such as the special agents of the United States and the Kuomintang, or the counter-revolutionaries hidden inside, they will definitely try every means to sabotage our people's happy cause. We must further strengthen the unity and friendship between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, maintain high vigilance, and closely cooperate with the national defense army to give a powerful blow to all enemies who dare to invade and sabotage. Finally, I will do my best to unite all cadres, unite the Li and Miao people, continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, improve the enthusiasm and creativity of production, practice economy, increase production, and complete and over-fulfill the specific tasks assigned to us by the state plan on time, in quantity, and in quality, and strive for the complete realization of the first five-year plan.

Wazha Moji, Representative, spoke:
I fully support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Law on National Service of the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy outlines a preliminary picture of our country's march towards prosperity and strength, and its realization will lay a good foundation for our country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. This is also a reliable guarantee for the development and progress of the Yi areas. The realization of this plan is the greatest benefit to all ethnic groups in the country, and it is also the greatest benefit to the Yi people. We must make every effort to strive for its realization.

It cannot be said that the five-year plan is only a matter of the Han areas, nor can it be said that the five-year plan has nothing to do with or little to do with the minority areas. In the draft of the five-year plan, according to the different regions where the various ethnic minorities are located and the different conditions they possess, specific regulations have been made to build several railways and highways, establish several mechanized farms, tractor stations, schools, health institutions, and conduct surveys and research on resources and transportation, etc., which are directly related to the development of economic and cultural undertakings in the minority areas (including the Yi areas). Take our West Sichuan Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture as an example. In the past few years, due to the implementation of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, with the overall development of the country and the strong support of the Han areas, the Liangshan Yi area has made significant progress and development. In political terms, ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented, a group of Yi cadres have grown, and in various levels of power, they mainly manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups; ethnic relations have been greatly improved, many disputes within the Yi ethnic group have been mediated, and many "enemies" have become relatives, and many battlefields for fighting enemies have become markets that meet the needs of the people, and many wastelands have become good fields. In economic terms, in recent years, due to the large amount of investment by the state (only the free distribution of iron agricultural tools has reached more than 400,000 items) and the promotion of advanced cultivation technology, the extremely backward state of "slash-and-burn" has been greatly changed, and both agriculture and animal husbandry have developed. According to the investigation and calculation of key areas, in 1954, the main crops increased by about 40% compared to 1949, and the income from animal husbandry and sideline industries increased by more than one fold, and the purchasing power of the people increased by 2.7 times. The remaining trade and transportation industries have also developed rapidly, and the business volume of state-owned commerce in 1954 increased by 69 times compared to 1951. The autonomous prefecture and various counties have connected the postal roads and wired telephones. In terms of culture and health, most areas have established ethnic primary schools, and each county has a well-equipped health center, health station, and health station, and the disease and death rates of the Yi people have been greatly reduced. Due to the above changes, the Yi people deeply feel the warmth of the big family of the motherland and Chairman Mao's care for ethnic minorities. They say: "The sun only shines during the day, the moon only shines at night, only Chairman Mao is the sun that never sets day and night." From the development and changes of the Yi areas in recent years, it should be understood that only when our entire country develops in all aspects, especially when socialist industrialization develops, can we guarantee that the Yi areas achieve success in all aspects, promote the development of the economy and culture of the Yi areas, and ensure that the minority areas can gradually transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, the realization of the five-year plan is not unrelated to us or has little to do with us, but has a very close relationship. We, the Yi people, must, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, strive for the realization of this plan. Although the Liangshan Yi area has made some progress and changes in various aspects in recent years, it is still a very backward area. To eliminate this backward state, to make the work of the Yi area adapt to the requirements of national construction, and to liberate the Yi people thoroughly, we must steadily, resolutely, and actively advance along the socialist road. Those who are satisfied with the status quo, think that "progress" has already been enough, and therefore do not actively work according to objective possible conditions, or do not actively and patiently cultivate and help Yi cadres, or do not actively seek the help of Han cadres, or do not actively develop production, and carry out trade, health, and other work in a passive attitude, are all wrong. These attitudes actually make our various work "stable but not progressive," and will make the Yi area remain in a backward state for a long time, which is not beneficial to the Yi people or national construction. These problems, we often produce ourselves, and we must pay attention to overcoming them. Of course, it is also necessary to prevent and correct the tendency of impetuousness and adventurism that exceeds the objective possible conditions. In short, we, the Yi people, must resolutely and actively walk the socialist road to have a bright future. At present, we should actively prepare the conditions for the implementation of democratic reform, and create more favorable conditions for the development of the economy and culture of the Yi area and the improvement of people's lives. Only in this way can we gradually make the Yi people shake off backwardness and join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and gradually transition to a socialist society.

Bo Yibo, Director, spoke:
The development of the national economy's first five-year plan in our country is a major step for the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the State Council, to realize the country's overall task in the transitional period. Its thorough implementation will lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country. Here, I would like to express some opinions on the development of heavy industry in the five-year plan.

Heavy industry is the industry that produces means of production, and it bears the heavy responsibility of transforming the technological foundation of the national economy and expanding socialist reproduction. The five-year plan stipulates the priority development of heavy industry and uses 88.8% of industrial investment to build heavy industry. I think this is completely in line with the party's general line in the transitional period and the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. Since liberation, heavy industry has developed greatly, and the annual output of major products, if 1952 is taken as 100, the growth situation in 1954 is as follows: pig iron 156, steel 165, electricity 151, raw coal 126, raw oil 184.1, ammonium sulfate 164.7, cement 161; the output value of machinery products, if calculated by the total production value, is 200% of 1952 in 1954. The growth of product varieties is also very rapid, and the machinery industry has successfully developed nearly 2,000 new products in a few years, and the black and non-ferrous metal industries have successfully developed more than 220 new products in 1954 alone. We can now produce 6,000-kilowatt power generation equipment, 154,000-volt and 20,000-kilovolt-ampere single-phase transformers, lathes with a cutting diameter of up to 5 meters, combined coal mining machines, locomotives, grain combine harvesters, new sets of textile machinery, medium-sized coastal ships and inland river ships. We are currently producing 10,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power generation equipment, blast furnace equipment with a capacity of 1,000 cubic meters, and coking equipment with an annual output of 300,000 tons, etc.

However, compared to the needs of the state, the level of heavy industry is still very backward. In 1955, the planned output of steel is only 3.6 kilograms per person when distributed per capita; especially high-quality steel, large and high-grade alloy steel cannot be produced; the varieties of non-ferrous and rare metals are not many; machinery and equipment can only meet about 60% of the needs of the state, especially large, special precision, and complex sets of products, most of which cannot be manufactured; the supply of electricity and oil is very tight; geological work is lagging behind the requirements of industrial development. Therefore, we must vigorously develop heavy industry. During the five-year plan period, various departments of heavy industry will build a large number of modern new enterprises and renovate existing enterprises; they will smelt hundreds of varieties of high-quality steel; they will manufacture thousands of new products, including those that cannot be manufactured now, and many kinds of heavy machinery and precision machine tools, aircraft, heavy trucks, and tractors, etc. By 1957, the total production value will be increased by 126.5% compared to 1952.

On the basis of the very weak heavy industry, to smoothly complete the above construction and production tasks is a very difficult task, and we must make the greatest efforts to solve the following problems.

First, regarding the technological renovation of heavy industry and the mastery of new technologies

The technological foundation of heavy industry in our country is very backward: the scale of enterprises is small, the equipment is outdated, the development is unbalanced, the degree of mechanization is low, and there is a lack of technical experience. On this backward basis, it is difficult to undertake the task of comprehensively transforming the technological foundation of the national economy. Therefore, in the initial stage of our industrial construction, we must first focus on the technological renovation of heavy industry and strive to gradually improve the technological level of heavy industry in our country to the level that an advanced industrial country should have after several five-year plans, and gradually transform the technological foundation of industry, transportation, and agriculture in our country in a planned and step-by-step manner.

During the first five-year plan period, the 156 new enterprises built by the Soviet Union to help our country are the first step in realizing the technological renovation of heavy industry in our country. These new enterprises have adopted the latest technological equipment and already have an advanced technological foundation. After building and mastering this batch of new enterprises, it will be possible to gradually place heavy industry in our country on the foundation of modern scientific and technological achievements. The main problem in these new enterprises is how to master new technologies, produce products that meet the design requirements in quality, and strive to quickly reach the design capacity. To do this, we must seriously study Soviet technical materials, train technical personnel and workers, learn to use new machinery and equipment, be familiar with the operation methods of new equipment, strictly follow the requirements of advanced design, and master the entire new production process.

Another important aspect of the technological renovation of heavy industry is to adopt and master new technologies in existing enterprises. Various departments of heavy industry should, on the basis of fully utilizing existing equipment, plan to add modern technological equipment according to the needs and possibilities of production development, improve the degree of mechanization of the production process, and gradually replace heavy manual labor with machines. We must strengthen product design, trial production, testing, and inspection work, establish strict technical order, formulate complete technical documents, strengthen process discipline, learn to use new technological equipment and new operation methods, and overcome backward production habits. In this way, we can improve production efficiency, increase the variety of products, and continuously improve product quality.

The adoption and mastery of new technologies must rely on the guidance of scientific and technological research work. For this reason, various departments of heavy industry must establish and improve research and experimental institutions as soon as possible, gradually do so that they can propose the technological development direction of their own departments, and make the formulation of technological policies and the compilation of technological development plans have a basis.

In the process of implementing technological renovation, we must comprehensively learn from the Soviet Union, and we must always summarize and apply all the existing and newly created advanced experiences at home and abroad. This is the basic way to quickly improve the technological level.

Second, carry out the work of industrial standardization

Standardization is an important technological policy in the process of realizing socialist industrialization. Standardization is to make unified regulations for various elements such as raw materials, products, production processes, technical conditions, and quality requirements in industry. Those that need to be implemented nationwide are promulgated as national standards by national laws. For example, the standard for steel specifications is formulated, and steel mills organize production according to the standard, which can simplify varieties, mass production, and improve quality. Machinery manufacturing factories select steel according to the standard, which can simplify design, process, material supply, and other aspects of work.

In recent years, some departments and enterprises have adopted some parts of the Soviet national standards in production, which has played a certain role, but because our country has not yet established national standards, so the production technology between departments still cannot be well coordinated. The supply of raw materials, the manufacture and use of equipment between departments often occur supply and demand imbalances, making the varieties complex, and the work of trial production of new products is greatly increased, and technical strength is greatly wasted. Take voltage as an example. Our country has inherited voltage levels from various countries, reaching 30-40 kinds (the Soviet Union has only 10 kinds), so power generation, transmission, and use, as well as the manufacture of equipment are much more complicated. Therefore, the promotion of standardization is an important prerequisite for simplifying varieties, improving quality, increasing production, and promoting the cooperation and coordination of production.

The current main problem in promoting standardization is, first of all, to establish a national agency in charge of standards, formulate national standards for our country according to the specific conditions of industrial development, and gradually unify them with reference to Soviet national standards. The method of formulation can be proposed from the bottom up and approved and approved from the top down. Second, various departments of heavy industry should also establish standardization agencies accordingly and gradually promote the standardization work of their own professions. The steps of promotion should start from the main industrial raw materials and main equipment in the heavy industry, first promote the basic standards, and then promote the professional standards.

Third, regarding the planning arrangement, specialization, and cooperation and coordination of heavy industry

Various departments of heavy industry are closely related to each other, and in terms of work arrangement, factory scale, construction speed, and variety development, they must be coordinated and coordinated, otherwise there will be a phenomenon of disconnection. The five-year plan has made appropriate arrangements for these problems, but in the process of implementing the plan, we must also actively adapt to the development of the situation and actively achieve the coordination and connection of annual plans, so as to smoothly complete the five-year plan.

In the heavy industry sector, in addition to state-owned and locally state-owned enterprises, there are also many joint-state and private enterprises. Taking the machinery industry as an example, in 1953, the total production value of modern large-scale machinery industry was 50.5% state-owned, 14.8% locally state-owned, 2.9% joint-state, and 31.8% private. These enterprises should be arranged in a planned manner in terms of production and construction. In the past few years, some capitalists, in pursuit of high profits, have blindly expanded production; some state-owned and locally state-owned enterprises, due to insufficient planned arrangements, have also had the phenomenon of blind development, resulting in repeated varieties, product accumulation, and poor quality, and a great waste of manpower, material resources, and technical strength. In the future, various departments of heavy industry should, based on needs and possibilities, and in accordance with the policy of socialist transformation of private capitalist industry, make more specific arrangements in the plan, so that various types of enterprises can be closely coordinated.

The reasonable arrangement of the plan must be based on specialization and cooperation and coordination. Specialized production is to define the product scope for each enterprise according to the principle of similar products and similar processes. In this way, the enterprise can be proficient in producing technology, quickly develop varieties, adopt specialized high-efficiency equipment, improve processes, organize large-scale or batch production. On the other hand, the products of heavy industry are diverse, the more specialized the production is, the more extensive the cooperation and coordination are needed. Especially in the machinery manufacturing industry, the product structure is complex, such as the factory producing cars and tractors, which needs dozens or even hundreds of factories to cooperate and coordinate. The Soviet Union produces cars and tractors, and the parts supplied by the cooperative and coordinated factories account for more than 50% of the cost of cars and about 30% of the cost of tractors. In our opinion, this level of specialization and cooperation and coordination is already high, but the Soviet Union still thinks it is low, thinking that it affects technological progress and the speed of production development.

Lenin believed that the development of socialized production, the increasing specialization of social labor, and the increasing number of independent industrial departments are one of the most important prerequisites for the socialist mode of production. With the development of heavy industry in our country, a batch of new enterprises will be put into production one after another, and the enterprises will increasingly need to develop in the direction of specialization, and the division of labor and cooperation and coordination will become more extensive and complex, so the work in this aspect will become more important.

In recent years, the state has established and will continue to establish some new industrial departments according to the principle of division of labor, and at the same time, various industrial departments have also defined the professional direction of most enterprises according to the principle of division of labor and organized specialized production, which is completely correct and necessary. However, there are still some factories that have not determined the professional direction, or have determined the professional direction but have not organized specialized production. There are also some factories that emphasize specialized production one-sidedly and do not want to accept cooperative tasks, and even if there is surplus capacity, they do not want to take on odd jobs. There are also some factories that want to make themselves a comprehensive factory, doing everything themselves, requiring the establishment of workshops and the addition of equipment, without considering cooperation and coordination with other factories.

In the future, to further strengthen specialization and cooperation and coordination, the following measures should be taken: first, formulate a long-term variety development plan based on the needs of the state, and thus determine the professional direction of enterprises; second, organize specialized factories according to the principles of need and economic rationality, such as specialized casting, forging, and standard parts factories; third, compile regional cooperation plans and combine departmental cooperation and regional cooperation in a planned manner; fourth, establish systems and set up special agencies to solve various problems in specialization and cooperation and coordination. To implement the above measures, we must also advocate the overall perspective and holistic concept in terms of ideology, and oppose the tendency of localism.

Fourth, improve enterprise management and implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy to improve labor productivity

During the first five-year plan period, the number of newly built enterprises put into production is not large, and the production plan mainly relies on existing enterprises to complete. Therefore, the technological renovation and improvement of enterprise management of existing enterprises are of great significance. It is wrong to only focus on the construction of new enterprises and not pay attention to the utilization of existing enterprises and not try to bring into play the production capacity of existing enterprises. Experience in recent years has proven that the potential of existing enterprises is still great. As long as we actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, accept the rationalization suggestions of the masses, and continuously improve enterprise management, we can greatly improve production capacity. For example, if the backward enterprises in the national flat furnace steel production can reach the production quota of the advanced enterprises, 170,000 tons of steel can be increased annually, accounting for 6.5% of the current production.

The management work of various departments of heavy industry has been greatly improved in recent years, but there are still many shortcomings. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out, many enterprises have only completed the output value indicators, but have not completed the variety and quality indicators of products, and have not completed the indicators of improving labor productivity and reducing costs; in the formulation of production plans, the requirements for output value and quantity are relatively clear and strict, while the variety, quality, and cost are not paid much attention to. Taking steel as an example, everyone pays attention to the tonnage and output value, but pays less attention to the production of new varieties; taking the machinery manufacturing industry as an example, in the calculation of completing the state tasks, it is often also based on the quantity and output value of the machinery, parts, and components produced, not based on the variety, quantity, and quality of the machinery, parts, and components produced for unified accounting. The phenomenon of loose and tight production in the middle of the month is still very common, and many enterprises only complete 20% of the monthly plan in the first ten days, 30% in the middle ten days, and 50% in the last ten days. The phenomenon of waste in production is also very serious: the metal utilization rate of our country's machinery and equipment manufacturing is only 45.5%, while the metal utilization rate in the Soviet Union's machinery manufacturing industry is 60-80%. There are too many non-production personnel, by the end of 1954, the proportion of non-production personnel in the enterprises under the three departments of heavy industry, fuel industry, and first machinery industry had risen to 26%. The equipment utilization rate is very low, the actual operating hours of cutting machine tools and forging and pressing equipment throughout the year still do not reach 60% of the hours that should be operated. The labor quota is not advanced, and many enterprises still use the method of estimated labor or experience statistics quota, so they cannot reflect the achievements of advanced workers and improve labor productivity. The work of implementing piecework wages is also very slow.

To overcome the above shortcomings, in addition to the previous mention of adopting and mastering new technologies, we must also strengthen planning work and economic work to improve labor productivity and economic results, and ensure the full completion of the state plan and the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy. First, we must overcome various causes of unbalanced production, strive to achieve balanced production, reduce non-production hours, actively eliminate overtime, prevent equipment accidents and personal accidents, and strengthen labor discipline. Second, we should better utilize the existing production area, increase the operating hours of machines, improve the equipment utilization rate, fully bring into play the production capacity, and oppose the tendency to easily abandon the existing equipment. Third, we should improve the quota work, gradually adopt advanced economic and technical quotas to improve the advanced nature of the plan. Improve the wage work so that the wage policy can promote the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Fourth, we should vigorously reduce the industrial administrative organs and non-production personnel, strengthen the production units. Fifth, we should strengthen economic activity analysis and accounting supervision, and through the comprehensive examination of plan indicators to expose shortcomings, expose waste, and expose subjectivism and bureaucracy in the leadership work of enterprises.

Fifth, regarding the training of technical personnel

The scale of heavy industry is gradually expanding, and new enterprises are being put into production one after another, all of which require technical personnel. In the past few years, although the growth rate of technical personnel is not small, it still cannot keep up with the needs. The current situation of technical personnel is: the number is not enough, the types of workers are unbalanced, and the technical level is not high. The average technical personnel of various departments of heavy industry only account for 5.7% of the total number of production workers; there are more low-level workers among the production workers, and there are not enough high-level workers and special workers, and the average technical level of workers is only 3.2-3.5 levels, while the new enterprises designed by the Soviet Union for our country generally require an average of 4 levels or above. Due to the lack of technical personnel, the increase in new products is still not fast enough, the quality of products is not good enough, new enterprises and new equipment cannot be quickly mastered, and technical research work cannot be quickly carried out. Therefore, training and strengthening the technical force is a key problem that must be solved at present, and in the future, we should: improve the quality of school education, and plan to send personnel to study abroad; strengthen the part-time education of workers, and pay attention to organizing the learning of technology by transferred senior and middle-level cadres, and improve their business leadership capabilities; rationally use the existing technical personnel, strengthen their political and ideological education, and through the establishment of scientific and technological research institutions, cultivate scientific and technological talents.

The above are the main problems that the heavy industry sector must solve during the five-year plan. Due to our weak foundation and lack of experience, solving these problems will encounter many difficulties. However, we have the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and the high enthusiasm for construction of the broad masses of workers, technical personnel, and cadres. As long as we seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, do a good job in the political and ideological work of enterprises, and combine political and ideological work with economic work well, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the tasks of heavy industry in the five-year plan will definitely be completed.

In the heavy construction work, we must also maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. Counter-revolutionaries are extremely hostile to our country's industrial construction, and heavy industry is the lifeline of the country's economy and the foundation of industrialization. They will first sabotage heavy industry. The events of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the Pan Hannian treason case, as well as other sabotage incidents, have already sounded the alarm for us. Therefore, all of us in the heavy industry sector must, while working hard in construction, also learn to fight against all enemies and resolutely eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries to protect the achievements of our country's heavy industry construction.

Comrades, the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country has been formulated. Let us, under the banner of Mao Zedong, together with the people of the whole country and all the workers, strive for the victory and over-fulfillment of this great five-year plan!

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    梁希部长的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告、彭德怀副总理关于兵役法草案的报告和彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告。我谨就如何实现林业五年计划问题，提出一些意见，请各位代表指教！
    森林，能保持水土，保障农田水利；保证供应工、矿、交通、建筑及其他基本建设所需用的木材。如果林业建设跟不上工业、农业及其它建设事业发展的需要，必然使整个国民经济发展受到影响。由此可见，林业建设是发展国民经济计划中不可缺少的一个重要部分。但林业建设是一项长期性的、艰巨的任务，只有依靠有关地区党政领导干部及广大群众大家动手，做好下列各项工作，才能顺利地实现林业五年计划。
    （一）进一步加强现有森林的保护工作，特别是防火工作：由于我国森林资源不足，且林木成长期慢，除加紧造林外，更重要的是保护现有森林。几年来，我们在这方面所吸取的严重教训是：要保护好森林，必须在当地党政的重视和领导下，依靠群众，组织群众，不倦地为预防火灾和病虫害作斗争。火，是森林最大的敌人。解放以后到一九五三年止，森林火灾虽已逐步减少，然一九五四年又增加，今年春季更严重。对护林防火工作，有些地区很重视，在党政统一领导下，把防火工作列入农村工作计划之内。每到容易发生山火的时期，各林区省、县、区都有护林防火指挥部；各林区村、屯都有护林队；各农业生产合作社和互助组都有护林小组，无论男女老少都动员起来，实行严格的分片分段的包干负责制，站岗放哨，互相督促检查，一有火灾发生，立即由领导干部带队前往扑救。在这些地区，积极防火救火的精神，已成为当地的一种习惯和风气。但也有一些地区却麻痹大意，不了解防火胜于救火的精神，对群众护林组织不勤加督促检查，任其自流；甚至某些私有林区，认为私有林不值得加以保护，采取不闻不问的态度，这是极端错误的。火灾发生的原因很多，其中有不少部分是出自反革命分子的破坏，这就不能不促使山区党政严重注意，今后应如何提高警惕，进一步把山区群众严密地组织起来，肃清一切暗藏的敌人。这不仅是护林防火所必须采取的重要措施之一，而且应该看成是当前的也是长期的复杂的阶级斗争的一个方面。有一些火灾的发生是由于群众烧荒烧垦不慎所引起的。由于我们对群众性的护林组织领导不够，对群众爱林护林教育不够；对护林和山区群众生产利益相结合的方针向基层干部交代不清，部署不周，使烧荒烧垦也成为森林火灾的重要原因，这是极不应该的。大家知道，林区多半是地广人稀，交通不便，一旦发生火灾，救火人员不易及时到达，往往造成重大的损失。根据几年来所摸索出来的一条重要经验，今后为了防止火灾，在大片国有林区，除了依靠林区周围群众护林外，国家还必须设立一些相应的专门机构来管理，更应修筑公路干线，添置武装护林部队及警察派出所，配备马匹、汽车，有火救火，无火防火，搜查山林，防止奸特。在平时，护林部队可以修道路，筑了望台，并做抚育更新工作。这样，林区周围防火可以和林区内部防火密切结合。在南方私有林区，人烟较关外稠密，可以采取因势利导因地制宜的办法，把林农组织起来，实行护林防火，并妥善安排林区生产。冬春两季应禁止烧垦烧荒，在非烧不可的地方，也应指定一定地点一定时间，有组织、有领导、有防备的进行。总而言之，不论国有林或私有林，护林工作是需要大家动手的。
    （二）积极进行山区生产规划工作：李富春副总理的五年计划报告中说：“在山区，应该适当地进行统一规划，使农业、畜牧业、林业、农家副业的发展互相结合，发展多种经济，并加强保持水土的工作”。这是非常重要的。实行了这种规划，才可以解决农、林、牧之间的矛盾，才可以在山区普遍地发动群众造林，才可以充分地、有效地、合理地利用土地，使山区经济逐渐繁荣起来。根据浙江开化、山东平邑、山西平顺等县的规划经验，估计经过二个、三个五年计划，山区经济发展水平可以提高二倍以上，而以后的发展潜力还取之不尽用之不竭的。
    实行了这种规划，还可以避免群众继续滥垦山坡。近来由于粮食增产需要，江西、湖北、浙江等省部分地区，正向山上大量发展耕地。如果听其盲目地无规划地乱垦下去，就会违反水土保持原则，给国家人民带来长期的重大的灾害。因为山上每年耕垦，加上滥伐森林，山土就会丧失覆被，大量地流向河川，把河道淤塞，把河床填高，造成平原农田可怕的灾害。今后为了停止乱垦，在陡坡和水土易于流失的地区应严禁乱垦，在宜垦地区垦荒，也应遵守水土保持原则，同时为了把群众目前利益和长远利益结合起来，又必须合理利用土地，把宜耕、宜牧、宜林地区，适当划分。概括地说，必须实行山区生产规划。
    我们希望在第一个五年计划内，或者再多一点时间，除了少数民族地区及人烟稀少的边远山区外，各省基本上能完成山区生产规划工作。在南方私有林区，还必须结合生产规划，查清森林资源，以便加强对私有林抚育工作的领导。这些山区生产规划工作，必须由党政统一领导，必须由有关部门协同动作，必须在发展互助合作的基础上发动群众，必须组织一定的技术力量，就是说，需要大家动手。
    （三）继续发动群众大力造林：几年来，各地区依靠群众造林，已取得了很大的成绩。以一九五四年为例：群众造林面积，占全国造林总面积的百分之九十四点四，而在群众造林中，又以合作造林占百分之七十至八十的比重。个别省份如山西、安徽、河北更达到百分之九十以上。在第一个五年计划中，造经济林四四四·九万公顷，防护林一五六·二万公顷，总共造林面积达六○一·一万公顷。我们相信，在广大群众日益高涨的社会主义与爱国主义的热情下，与互助合作日益发展的基础上，是可以完成而且超额完成这个任务的。
    随着合作造林的发展，全国已有了合作造林组织，如林业互助组，林业合作社，农林生产合作社或农林牧生产合作社等。到今年五月底为止，据十七个省的统计，各种合作造林组织（不是现有的林木合作社）合计已有十八万二千多个。我们希望有关地区党政更积极地领导这些组织，使获得进一步的巩固与提高。尤其是在山区现有的农业生产互助合作组织内，都要把造林工作列入常年生产计划，并保证按计划完成任务。这也是需要大家动手的一项工作。
    （四）稳步开展封山育林工作：不少事实证明，封山育林的确是消灭荒山保持水土的最有效最经济的办法。五年多以来，各省已因此绿化了许多山区，收到了蓄水保土的功效，还解决了群众一部分的燃料和饲料问题。如山东的沂蒙山区，河北省的涞源县，杭州的灵隐山，自从有计划的封山以后，山坡上长满了杂草和幼树，林子里积起了落叶腐殖质。过去每年雨季山洪暴发，泥沙俱下，现在这种现象已改变，有些地方，被冲毁了的耕地已恢复起来。此外，封山育林以后，可以收果实，采柴火，有的地方还可以养柞蚕，好处多得很。
    但，封山育林作得不好，容易和群众目前利益发生矛盾，必须要有适当的办法：（1）要有党政统一领导，通过山区生产规划，把一村或一乡之内的林地、牧地和打柴地合理的加以划分，并建立一些必要的、简而易行的制度；（2）一定要通过乡人民代表大会讨论决定；（3）要经常宣传教育，使封山育林成为一村或一乡的集体事业，必要时，要订立一村或联村公约。这也需要大家动手。
      （五）加强对私有林区木材采伐的管理工作：南方地区有很多的私有林，几年来，林农大肆砍伐，不仅年年突破国家收购计划，而且大大地影响了水土保持。如一九五四年全国私有林的收购计划即超过计划的百分之四十。据苏联专家们多次建议，认为南方森林，基本上是水源林。为了涵养水源，保持水土，目前只宜多造，不宜多采。我们认为这个建议是正确的。因此，如何通过国家的木材收购，来限制林农盲目采伐，把私有林木材生产逐步纳入国家计划轨道，这是对农村社会主义改造的工作之一。要达到上述目的，必须实行下列措施：
    （1）要正确合理地调整各地区的木材价格，纠正偏高偏低的缺点，用价格政策逐步引导农林生产纳入国家计划。（2）要向林农宣传国家坚决保护林农劳动成果的政策，只要是他们自己种植的，或在土改时分到的林木，其所有权国家一律依法予以保护，让他们安心经营，不要滥砍滥伐。（3）要实行订约收购。各级党政应根据国家分配的木材收购任务，定出可能生产的采伐计划，提交林区乡人民代表大会讨论，由林农自报公议，定出互助组、合作社与个体林农的采伐数量，不得任意多伐。收购站除照约收购外，还应准备一定数量，收购个体林农的木材。
    （4）森林工业机构和林业行政部门应分别对林农在伐木、造材、运输及抚育更新各方面加以技术指导。
    （5）银行和信用合作社应通过储蓄和信贷的办法，吸收林农游资，从事林业及其他生产。
    （6）林区供销合作社应加强对林农生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。这又是大家动手。
    （六）厉行节约，反对浪费：这个问题，在李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两个报告中都郑重地提出了。在这里，我们犯的毛病甚多，特别是木材工业。虽然木材工业几年来为国家完成了任务，积累了资金，但浪费现象是严重地存在的。这主要表现：在采伐上，不采坏木材，只采好木材，不认真保留母树，清理林场，为迹地更新创造条件，使森林资源大受损失。在基本建设上，房屋建筑标准过高，林区里本来可以盖平房，“烧火墙”的，而东北有些森林工业局偏要学都市的样子，造楼房，烧暖汽；每个森林工业局都有个礼堂，有些礼堂装饰得相当华丽。森林铁路虽然是属于生产性的，但也有些设计标准偏高。买来的机器，有许多没有充分利用。在人员使用上，非生产人员太多，人浮于事的现象很严重；旷工也太多，伊春管理局去年一年旷工数达七十七万个工日，哈尔滨管理局去年一年旷工数达九十九万个工日。在木材保管上，据东北、内蒙十五个贮木场不完全统计，由于保管不善，目前存在贮木场的二百七十二万立方公尺木材中，因虫害及腐朽而变质降等的，有三十二万立方公尺之多。为了克服这些严重的浪费现象，我们正在拟订节约计划，大量缩减非生产人员，并拟订降低基本建设标准、降低造价的新规定。今后除我们严格督促各地林业及木材工业机构厉行节约外，还希望各级党政和各位代表对这些浪费行为严格地加以监督、指责、揭发和批评。就是说，这里也一样地希望大家动手。这几天，大家热烈地讨论了中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。五年的时间，在林业上是很短很短的，中国荒山这么多，树木长成这么慢，大小兴安岭的红松、落叶松要生长一百年到一百四十年才成大材，长江以南的杉木也至少要培养三十年以上才中用。短短五年，做不了多少工作。但五年就是五十年、一百年的开端。今天，我们已吸取了若干经验，发现了无穷力量，认识到了林业是整个国民经济建设中不可分割的一个重要部分，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，从党、政领导机关到群众，从中央到地方，大家一齐动手来建设林业，我相信，我们一定能够完成中国历史上第一个五年计划，踏进光明的伟大的社会主义道路。
    陈其尤代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，并决心为实现它们而努力！我同意彭真副委员长兼秘书长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，不仅对于我国是具有伟大的历史意义，对于世界来说，也是具有伟大的作用的。由于第一个五年计划本身所具的现实性，这个计划是完全可能胜利完成的。自然，在执行中不免有某些困难（如李富春副总理所指出的），但在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导之下，加上全国人民对于社会主义建设的积极性与创造性和苏联无私的帮助及各人民民主国家的支持，困难是可以克服的。
    在我国解放之初，美国帝国主义和其他与中国人民为敌的人，曾把他们的希望寄托在新中国在经济方面没有办法而垮台的狂妄想法上。但中国共产党和毛主席领导着我们进行了三年的经济恢复工作，到一九五二年我国国民经济就大部分恢复了战前的最高水平，有的工业部门还大大地超过；一九五三年起便开始了我们的第一个五年计划的建设。经过两年多的实践，现在我们更能够在现实的基础上把计划订得更切实，更有把握，把某些重要的工业生产提高到更高的水平。历史注定了人民必然胜利，帝国主义者和一切中国人民的敌人们有什么力量来阻止历史前进呢？
    但在另一方面，我国社会主义建设的每一个胜利都是为我们兄弟国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民所衷心祝贺的，因为我们的胜利也就是他们的胜利；而在我国进行第一个五年计划的建设工作中，苏联和各人民民主国家给予我们积极的支援，更构成我们能够胜利的因素之一。我们尤当以最大的诚恳心情感谢苏联，因为有了苏联对社会主义建设的经验，使我国在进行建设中少走弯路。有了苏联长期的无私的帮助，使我们更能满怀信心地完成和超额完成我们的建设计划。
    一九五四年的国家决算和一九五五年的国家预算是配合我们国家伟大的经济建设计划的。它们妥善地按照我们的建设步骤，准备了我们的建设资金并规定了合理的开支。一九五五年预算明确地指示了我们每一分资金的收入和支出的关系和每一个劳动时与我们国家经济建设的关系，也明确指示了我们努力的方向。完成了国家的预算就是对于我们国家的经济计划的实现推进了一步。
    在第一个五年计划的报告和国家预决算的报告中都特别提出增加生产、厉行节约的问题，这是非常正确的。社会主义建设所需的庞大建设资金，只有从增加生产、节约支出来积累，这是很明白的。可是从过去的检查中，有些资金却给浪费了，这是不可容忍的。我完全拥护李先念副总理提出的对贪污浪费的行为分别给予惩处的意见。又在一九五五年的预算中，用于经济建设及社会福利事业的费用达百分之七十五以上，这就有力地证明了我国对于和平的真诚愿望。帝国主义者和一切反革命分子的造谣诬蔑是不攻自破的。最后我想提一提我在这一次会议前视察中的一两点感想：第一、在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告发表之后，听说有人对于农业方面仅比一九五二年提高粮产量百分之十七点六有些怀疑。他们说我国人口的增加率相当大，目前粮食的供应情况比起富裕的国家平均率还少得多，那末在第一个五年计划中对广大农民生活的改善还是很少的。我认为这看法是不对的。因为我国第一个五年计划对于农业方面的特点是贯彻“组织起来”的方针。第一个五年计划中规定参加合作社的农户达三分之一，并进一步发展和提高各种具体形式的劳动互助组织。我本人这一次曾视察了北京附近的国营南郊农场和黄土岗乡农业生产合作社，从那儿了解到农业生产合作社比还在互助组时的收入平均增加一倍，而国营农场由于使用机器，其收入又比合作社增加百分之七十以上。这两个农业组织还很年轻，还存在着缺点，改进后当有更大的提高的。由此可见，只有逐步把农业纳入社会主义组织，实行农业机械化，才能增加收入提高农民生活。再则，在第一个五年计划中农业及其副业总值提高了百分之二十三点三，这对于改善农民生活并不是没有重要意义的。第二、许多代表在分组讨论时都提到反革命分子的破坏行为，这确是一个严重的事实；在沿海地区如广东省，因为接邻港、澳，潜入的美蒋特务和暗藏的反革命分子进行破坏的事实更多。我在视察清河农场劳改工作时也听到去年还有在劳改中的军统特务阴谋组织暴动的事。结合潘汉年及胡风的事件，我们深刻地认识到敌人的阴谋破坏是十分凶顽的，我们是不能麻痹大意了。为了保证我们社会主义建设的不遭破坏，我们一定要严厉镇压一切反革命分子，同时还要加强马克思列宁主义的学习以提高政治警惕。
    我对于常务委员会一年来所作的工作，完全满意。以五十年为期的关于根治和开发黄河的综合规划，是世界上少见的巨大工程，它将变以灾害著名的河流为人民的利益服务，这是只有在毛泽东时代才能有的事情。我完全拥护这个伟大的规划。我提议我们通过发展国民经济的第一个五年计划、一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算、中华人民共和国兵役法、常务委员会工作报告和治理和开发黄河的综合规划。
    郭孟和代表的发言
    我听了李富春副总理的报告，感到第一个五年计划真是伟大，我完全拥护，坚决执行。
    我是玉门油矿的一个钻井工人，从一九四五年起，我就在那里做工。解放前后矿上的情形，我都很清楚。美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团，是根本不要我国有石油工业的。在国民党反动统治时期，玉门油矿办了十几年，还是破破烂烂。矿上一共只有五部小型钻机，一部钻机每天只能打二十公尺。一口油井至多打到八百公尺深。一年只打六个月。石油工人的生活更苦，反动派把我们不当人。住在戈壁滩上，吃的是冷饭，许多工人都得了胃病，有病也没钱治。
    解放后，在共产党的领导下，在苏联和各人民民主国家帮助下，玉门油矿的情形就完全两样了。现在我们已经有大型钻机三十多部，全年都可以打钻。每天打井的进度，也一年比一年提高，今年已经创造日进尺三百七十二公尺的新纪录；并且可以打三千公尺的深井。光是一九五四年一年打的井，就比国民党时代十几年打的井还要多。解放前许多报废了的井，现在也都修好出油了。过去美国技师吹牛：“建设一座达普斯裂炼炉，没有三年不行，没有我们美国人也不行。”解放后我们只用六个月就修成了。我们工人也当了油矿的主人，政治觉悟和生产积极性大大提高，生活有了很大改善。现在我们大家都在戈壁滩上的石油城里很愉快地劳动和生活着。
    石油的重要，大家都是知道的。我们国家的社会主义工业化和农业的机械化，都离不了石油。目前我们的石油工业还很落后，产量还远远赶不上需要。玉门油矿是祖国第一个天然石油基地，在第一个五年计划期间，负有特别重要的责任。我们一定要努力做好改建和扩建工作，努力寻找新的油田，努力增加产量，生产更多的石油来支援国家建设。我们油矿的潜力还很多，只要大家动脑筋，找窍门，就可以挖掘出来。譬如一台钻机搬家，过去要用七天，现在只要四天，节省出来的时间，平均可以多打一百多公尺，将来还能够更加缩短时间。再拿钻进来说，现在月进尺虽然已经达到八百公尺，但是同苏联工人用同样钻机月进尺一千五百到两千公尺来比较，还是低的，还能够提高。我们矿上各方面的浪费也相当严重。譬如打钻的时候，只图进尺，不管成本高低，不爱惜油料器材，随便消耗。所以我们一定要厉行节约，反对浪费，替国家节省更多的人力和金钱。我们矿上的青年节约队干得很好，他们每天下工后用一两个钟头的时间，在一个多月内就收回了原油七十三吨，废料三十五吨，青砖九万多块，卵石一万多方。他们给全体工人做出了好榜样。
    我们要建设，敌人一定要钻进来破坏。我们矿上也发现过这种事件。今年三月就有一部吊车的电线被反革命分子割断。过去有些人总以为矿上没有什么。其实问题决不是这样简单。麻痹大意就容易给敌人钻空子。我们大家都要提高警惕，时刻留心，清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，决不让敌人来破坏我们的事业。
    我一定要把这次会议的精神带回去向全体工人同志传达清楚，并且同全体工人一道，积极响应党和毛主席的号召，增产节约，学习苏联先进经验，保证完成国家第一个五年计划交给我们的光荣任务。
    钱瑛部长的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，坚决拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案。
    过去两年，在中国共产党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，执行第一个五年计划以来，我国工业、农业生产有了迅速的增长，国民经济面貌开始发生重大的变化，社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业已经取得巨大的成就，国家工作人员的政治觉悟有了提高。他们当中绝大多数都能忠实地履行自己的职责，密切地联系广大群众，保持了艰苦朴素的作风，发扬了勤勤恳恳为人民服务的精神，创造了许多英雄模范事迹。这就是实现我国第一个五年计划的有力保证。
    但是，在两年来我们实行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的过程中，也证明了阶级斗争是更加尖锐、复杂和深刻的，这种尖锐复杂的斗争，不仅表现在国内外敌人采取了一切卑鄙恶毒的办法来破坏我们的建设事业，而且还表现在封建残余和资产阶级思想不断向我们机关企业中的工作人员侵袭腐蚀，因而增加了我们建设事业的许多困难和损失，这是值得我们时刻警惕的。
    两年来，各级监察机关有重点地集中地检查了某些国营企业中严重的损失、浪费现象。有些部门企业中由于领导上官僚主义和工作人员不负责任，或缺乏计划性盲目采购，或宽打窄用，层层追加计划，致造成物资的严重积压。一九五四年底和一九五五年初八个工业部门监察机关检查了三百多个企业单位，材料积压即达三亿五千万元。有些企业中这种现象至今仍未完全克服。如第一汽车制造厂热电站今年第二季度只需要生石灰十八吨，但在编制第二季度计划时，盲目地编为七千吨，比实际需要量大了三百八十多倍，而这个计划竟为该站的制表、复核、计划科长、供应科长、总工程师、站长等六人层层签章同意，直到供应处计划科审查时才发觉，会同监察室检查纠正。
    有些工厂不注意安全设备和检修工作，致造成严重事故。如天津国棉一厂早在一九五一年即发现二号锅炉漏水，修理后仍经常渗水，今年二月起漏水加多，至四月每小时漏水竟达一吨半，工人曾不断反映，但该厂动力科及锅炉车间负责人员欺上压下，任意修改检修计划，长期不予修理，该厂领导上对此亦未检查，致发生爆炸事故，伤亡职工和市民七十七人，其中死亡八人，直接损失财产三十六万九千余元，全厂停工五天，减产棉纱八百九十余件，棉布二万余匹，影响到纺织工业部四月份的纱布生产计划没有完成。
    有些工矿企业片面追求产值、产量，忽视质量，不认真贯彻操作规程和学习苏联经验，致出产大量废品，造成很大损失。如最近检查出沈阳重型机器厂一九五四年全年废品达二千八百余吨，净损失一百五十二万五千余元，并影响到八十九个兄弟厂矿的生产建设。
    有些国营公司，商品积压、损耗现象亦很严重。今年上半年十七个省市监察厅局检查了四十三个公司，据不完全统计积压商品价值五十二万八千四百四十五元，又有五十七个单位因保管不善致商品霉烂残损，价值五百四十五万元。
    粮食部门有些单位，因加工和仓储保管不善，造成粮食损失的情况也是严重的。仅辽宁省监察厅今年上半年所检查的十四个县、市粮食仓库即有生虫的粮食一亿四千余斤，完全霉烂不能食用的粮食一万八千余斤。有些单位由于领导上政治思想麻痹，忽视安全保卫工作，致坏人乘机破坏造成很大的损失。湖南全省一九五五年一至三月份共发生粮食被盗事件三百七十五起，被盗粮食四万六千余斤，失火事件五十二起，烧毁粮食十五万四千五百余斤。
    上述许多浪费、损失的造成，有些是由于制度不健全，领导上疏于督促检查；有些则由于工作人员思想作风不纯，严重不负责任；也有的是反动分子的破坏所致。但某些人对这些情况漠不关心或不予过问，甚至有些机关企业的领导干部强调业务繁忙，任务紧迫，对自己工作中存在的许多严重问题，不追究原因，因而对于敌人来自各方面的袭击，不易发现。两年来，许多监察机关检查了又在滋长的贪污盗窃现象。一九五四年工业、商业、银行等八个财经部门监察室检查和处理了贪污案件五千一百多起。贪污人员大多是留用人员或新招收人员，有的是经不起资产阶级的引诱，有的则原系资产阶级分子出身，混入我国营企业中有意行窃的。如中国人民银行哈尔滨分行贪污分子徐维珍，原系资本家，混入我国家银行后，大肆贪污，从一九五二年“三反”运动后期到一九五五年二月，有据可查者，先后贪污“三反”退赃款项一百一十次，金额二万六千余元，而且他一手贪污，一手明目张胆地在该行存款，历时两年余无人发觉，因为他伪装积极，反而被认为是好干部，受到表扬和提拔。最后由于他自己做贼心虚，突然潜逃，才被捉回破案。又如湖北省某区供销合作社被奸商混进来当了副主任后，又拉进八个奸商和流氓当干部，大肆贪污盗窃，做投机买卖，剥削农民，引起群众极大的愤恨。
    两年来，各地监察机关有重点地检查了农村干部执行政策的情况，说明广大农村干部在以互助合作为中心的增产运动、生产救灾、防汛抗旱、统购统销等各项艰巨的工作中，执行了国家对农业社会主义改造的各项政策，并一直以自己的模范行为和忘我精神领导着广大群众，克服各种困难，和自然灾害及阶级敌人作坚决的斗争。也发现潜伏在农村中的反革命分子和各种犯罪分子，一方面用尽阴谋诡计破坏我们的农业社会主义改造事业，另一方面则伪装进步积极，混入互助合作组织，篡夺基层政权，进行各种破坏活动。如山东滋阳县尚彭乡土匪毛德心等数人篡夺了乡政权，勾结地主，敲诈勒索，强奸妇女，陷害乡村干部等，横行不法。再如山东德平县第十区，地主、伪军出身的郑庆祥篡夺了区长职务后，任用有血债的流氓为乡长，包庇反革命分子多人，迫害共产党员和干部，欺压群众。全国监察机关一九五四年处理的违法乱纪分子中，有二千一百九十三人是属于反革命的破坏活动。
    由于农村的工作任务繁重，又由于某些领导干部的官僚主义，不了解下情，只给干部任务，不具体交代政策和作法，任务布置以后，又缺乏深入的检查和帮助，加以某些农村干部作风不好，或者政策水平太低，经验缺乏，往往只顾完成任务，不懂得教育群众，而发生了一些强迫命令的现象。我们对于这些干部，主要应耐心教育，提高其政策思想水平，帮助其纠正缺点、错误。但必须与那些蜕化变质的违法乱纪分子特别是反革命破坏分子严格区分。有些人由于对阶级敌人的阴谋破坏缺乏警惕，分不清那些是我们干部在工作中的缺点和偏差，那些是反革命分子有意的破坏，把农村中由于敌人的破坏而发生的许多严重问题都算在农村干部的账上，或者把少数干部的错误和缺点，夸大成为多数干部的错误和缺点，看不见我们广大下层干部的艰苦积极，任劳任怨，全心全意为人民服务的革命精神。这显然是不正确的。
    各级监察机关对上述检查揭发出来的问题，有的已建议有关主管部门改善纠正，对其中有关人员，错误情节轻微者则令其检讨纠正，违法失职的则分别予以纪律和法律的制裁。但过去两年各级监察机关在工作中还存在许多缺点，有些问题还未能及时进行检查，有的检查以后未能及时处理；有些情节复杂的问题检查得不深不透，有时将由于坏分子破坏而造成的事件，简单地看成为制度不严、领导上官僚主义、工作人员不负责任的一般事件，因而使问题得不到彻底解决，坏分子未能受到应有的制裁，也不能取得深刻的经验教训，以教育广大干部和群众。这些缺点，今后当努力纠正。
    为了适应阶级斗争新时期的要求，更有效地反对坏人坏事，以保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，必须进一步加强国家监察工作，充分发挥监察工作的作用，提高监察工作的思想性和战斗性，各级监察机关必须在各级党委和政府的领导下及各有关部门的协助、支持下，依靠广大人民群众，集中地监督和检查经济建设特别是工业建设计划的执行情况。为此，就要不断地提高监察工作人员的政治思想、理论和业务水平，使他们有明确坚定的阶级立场，尖锐的政治敏感，高度的责任心和实事求是的精神，能够坚决地和各种资产阶级思想及破坏分子作斗争；能够坚决地和官僚主义、铺张浪费、贪污盗窃和违法乱纪的现象作斗争，以巩固国家纪律，保证第一个五年计划的切实执行。
    黄敬部长的发言
    我完全同意发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，和李富春副总理关于五年计划的报告。我只就机械工业在执行五年计划中的一个关键性的问题——掌握新技术问题发表一点意见。
    国家工业化就是要把国民经济，包括农业在内，逐步过渡到现代化的技术基础上去。现代化生产技术主要是劳动过程的机械化，用机器生产代替手工生产。因此，要改造各经济部门的生产技术，就需要有大量的、新式的机器装备。
    第一个五年计划，全部基本建设投资中，用于购买机械设备的约占百分之三十八。工业投资中约占百分之四十，农林水利投资中约占百分之十七，就是在文教建设投资中也占百分之十，这些说明机械工业在国家建设中担负着重大责任。
    我国机械工业的基础很落后，解放以前的机械工厂基本上是干修配活的，即使制造，也只能做些简单的、技术要求不高的机器。解放后，经过把修配厂改造为制造厂，把小厂扩充为大厂，并建设了若干新厂，机械工业的技术水平和制造能力有了很大提高。例如：北京第一机床厂，是由十几个小修械所拼凑起来的，开始只能制造火车添水用的水鹤、小型的水泵等简单产品，经过几年的努力，现在已经能够大批制造苏联型号的万能铣床了。上海机床厂，在解放前是国民党官僚资本的一个农业机器厂，名义是机器厂，实际上只是替美帝国主义推销剩余农业机器，根本没有制造过什么机器，现在已经是一个制造精密磨床的工厂了。全国机械工业一九五四年的总产值已达一九四九年的十三倍，新型的产品增加了近二千种。目前我们已能制造新式机床七十多种，六千瓩火力发电设备，一万瓩水力发电设备，中速柴油机，炼焦设备，矿山用的勘探、采掘、运输、洗选、破碎和卷扬设备，一立米电铲，铁路机车，中型轮船，谷物联合收割机以及风动工具、滚珠轴承等等。今后三年还要生产和试制一千五百四十多种的新品种，其中包括约一百种新型机床，一万二千瓩火力发电设备，三立米电铲，一千立米高炉的成套设备，载重汽车及轻型拖拉机等等。这些说明机械工业供应设备的能力正在迅速增长，但是，这些发展和国家需要的增长相比较，则还相差很远。第一个五年计划期间所需要的机器设备，从数量上说国内只能供应约百分之六十；从品种上说，能供应的比例更少，许多特别大型的、特殊精密的和复杂成套的设备，在第一个五年计划期间还不能制造。此外，我们能够制造的产品，有些在质量上也还未能达到标准，例如有些机床达不到规定的精度，有些动力机械达不到应有的效率，有些厂因为产品质量不好，经常派人到各地去修理已经出厂的产品。
    产品品种少，质量差，这就是机械工业当前的根本问题，其主要原因在于我们的技术落后。
    第一、技术基础落后。要制造现代化的机械产品，必须有一定的技术装备。制造大型产品，需要大型设备；制造精密产品，需要精密机床。大量生产复杂而精密的产品就需要许多专用设备。几年来，现有企业虽然增添了不少设备，但制造特别大型的、特殊精密的产品仍有困难。例如，一套轧钢厂的一千一百五十公厘的初轧设备全部有十几万件零件，这些零件中大件很多，其中最重的零件重达八十吨，铸造和锻造这些零件就要有很大的铸钢车间和重型的锻造设备；加工这些零件，还要有一套特殊的重型机床，因此要成套生产这种产品就要建设新厂。
    第二、技术力量薄弱。特别是高级技术人员和高级技工，不仅数量少，而且工种不全。因此很多应该建立的技术机构建立不起来；新建的大厂要求有很多的工程师，我们配备不齐；现有工厂的许多技术问题也得不到及时的解决。新厂设计和产品的设计，大部要靠苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，自己目前还不能独立进行比较复杂的设计。在工艺上，很多先进加工方法，像精密加工、电焊、大型锻造等等，运用起来都还有困难。
    第三、在生产中还存在着落后的修配习惯。这几年在苏联和各人民民主国家派遣的专家直接帮助下，学习了一些先进经验，生产的组织与技术水平有了很大提高。但是，在建立正规的技术制度，改变旧的修配习惯上，各工厂做到的程度还很不平衡，要把这项工作普遍彻底做好，还要作很大的努力。目前有些产品还没有一套完整的技术文件，或者有了技术文件也还缺乏必要的规章和制度来保证贯彻。有的产品虽然有图样、有标准，也没有严格地按照图样和标准制造，对工艺过程及所应当使用的机器、工具、材料及操作方法等缺乏统一和严格的规定，有的虽然有了规定，也没有认真贯彻。有些工人仍习惯于老办法，一个师傅一个传授，各有自己的一套操作方法。在检验上，也还缺乏明确的检验标准和严格的制度。这样，做出来的零件就不可能精确，最后装配时只好大的改小，小的扩大，用所谓“对号入座”和锉、刮、敲、打的办法装在一起，这样做出来的机器，质量当然好不了。
    机械工业的这种技术落后状况，显然是和发展国民经济的要求不相适应的。不建立一个强大的机械工业，就不能实现社会主义工业化，不能独立地发展国民经济，因此，第一个五年计划把发展重工业作为社会主义工业化的中心环节，并强调发展机械工业，是完全必要的。李富春副总理在五年计划的报告中指出：提高工业技术水平，是完成社会主义工业化的任务的一个基本条件，我们认为这是完全正确的。必须克服机械工业的技术落后状况，才能使机械工业强大地发展起来。
    克服机械工业的技术落后状况，要从两个方面努力：一方面要在苏联和各人民民主国家的技术援助下建设一批新的现代化的工厂，以根本改变机械工业落后的技术基础；另一方面还要对原有工厂进行技术改造。
    五年计划中，机械工业将建设一批新的工厂，这些工厂都是用最新技术装备起来的，建成后，将大大改变机械工业的面貌。这是克服机械工业技术落后状态最重要的一个方面。新工厂建成以后，关键问题是掌握新技术问题，掌握了新技术才能制造出合格的产品，发挥工厂的生产能力，达到工厂设计的要求。要掌握新技术，首先，在开工前要做好各项准备工作。国外设计的厂，当各种技术资料到厂以后，就要迅速组织翻译，认真学习，而后以这些资料为根据，进行各方面的具体准备工作。如人员、设备、工具、材料、厂外协作等。这些准备工作，都要依照技术资料中所规定的条件，在开工前准备齐全。其次，要进行试生产：考验设备、工具、材料等是否符合要求，校对各种技术文件，并教育职工熟悉和掌握新设备、工具及操作方法等。在试生产中从零件到成品都先要求按规矩做成（达到质量标准），然后要求做快（达到技术定额），直到所有过程都被掌握了，才算完全掌握了新的生产。
    在掌握新生产过程里，最要紧的就是必须规规矩矩地按照技术文件的规定办事，要向职工反复进行教育，必须坚持学会新技术，遇到困难要积极克服，不能随便更改规定，必须遵守工艺纪律，只有养成了这样的正规的生产习惯，才能给以后正式生产打下良好的基础；如果在这时候马虎凑合留下一个坏根子，以后再改，就困难了。可是我们在这方面是有缺点的，过去对掌握新生产缺乏明确的认识，有的同志以为能够做出一两个合格产品就算是掌握了新生产了。但是，这一两个合格的产品是怎样做出来的呢？它是用不正规的办法，在浪费很多工时和材料的条件下凑出来的。这一两个成品虽然可以勉强合格，但一到正式成批制造就不行了。已投入生产的风动工具厂，就曾经忽视了这一点，他们不认真学习和贯彻苏联设计的资料，仍按自己老一套的落后习惯办事，后来虽然纠正了，但是已经走了一段弯路。这对我们来说，是一个严重的教训。当然，在试生产的过程中，会遇到技术文件上的要求有些和我国具体条件不相适应的情况，不得不做一些必要的修改，例如，有些材料国内一时还不能生产，就要采用代用材料，材料一变，加工的方法等也要跟着改变。但是这种修改决不可轻率，只有在确实有必要时才可以改变，而且一定要经过严格审查和批准。
    在第一个五年计划期间，投入生产的新工厂还不多，满足国家需要主要还依靠原有工厂的生产，而且培养技术力量和积累技术经验，也都要由原有的工厂担任。因此，对原有工厂进行技术改造，也是改变机械工业技术落后状态的一个极重要的方面。不能只注意建设新厂，而忽视了原有工厂的改造。
    根据这几年的经验，原有工厂的技术改造，主要要做好以下几个工作：
    第一、明确企业的专业发展方向，组织专业化生产。目前有一部分企业的专业方向还未确定，或者有了专业方向，还没有组织专业化生产。因此在这些厂里通用的设备多，专用设备少，专门技术问题解决不了。生产效率很低。企业的专业方向不肯定，就不能有计划地考虑产品发展的顺序，因此技术发展缺乏方向。不组织专业化的生产，就不能按产品特点合理地组织生产过程、配备专用的设备和工具，也无从积累专业的设计与制造经验和培养专门的技术人员与工人，这样，就大大地阻碍了技术水平的提高。因此，明确企业的专业方向和组织专业化生产，是旧企业进行全面技术改造的一个重要前提。各工厂的专业方向必须根据国家需要的情况，结合各厂的具体条件，进行全面的安排和决定，不然就会使生产和需要不能适应。
    第二、要根据企业的专业发展方向，适当补充必要的设备、工具和试验、检验仪器等；对旧有的设备要充分利用，应进行检查和修理，提高其效能，恢复其精度，使现有企业有可能生产更多的和质量更好的产品品种，充分发挥生产能力。
    第三、要通过新产品的试制和老产品的技术补课，建立起现代化的、正规的生产技术秩序。试制新产品一定要准备好图样和必要的技术文件，在这些文件中应规定产品的技术条件，加工和检验的方法，以及使用什么设备、工具、材料等，并且要经过试制把上述的图样和各种规定加以鉴定，然后规规矩矩进入正式生产，要严格执行生产中的检验工作，不合格的产品不能出厂。继续生产的老产品，也要比照新产品的办法进行技术补课。
    此外，应重视群众在技术上的创造，不能因为要按规矩办事，就忽视了它。应当有领导地组织合理化建议工作，发挥群众智慧，以解决技术中的一些关键问题。对群众创造应经过科学的鉴定和总结，然后加以推广。
    为了掌握新技术还要注意解决两个问题：
    第一、培养技术力量
    培养技术力量要靠两方面，一方面是从学校训练。目前，各级技术学校的架子都已经搭起来了，今后毕业学生的数量是会逐年增多的，但一般质量还较差，需要注意提高。另一方面要发展业余教育。苏联经验证明，这是培养工业人材最有效的办法。在我们目前转业干部多，工人提拔的干部多、新工人多的情况下，业余教育更加重要。
    第二、培养独立设计能力和开展科学研究工作
    目前我们的工厂设计和产品设计，极大部分是依靠苏联和各人民民主国家的援助；但是我们不能长此依赖下去，今后要建设更多的新厂，要制造更多的产品，并要适应我国资源特点与特殊的需要进行专门的设计，这就要求我们有独立的设计能力；而独立的设计又要建筑在试验研究工作的基础上。因此，我们必须加强同科学院及高等学校研究机构的联系，并积极建立与健全部内的设计和工艺研究机构，开展技术研究工作。以上就是我们为了掌握新技术所要做的主要工作。进行以上工作，我们首先要充分估计苏联和各人民民主国家援助的作用。他们不仅帮助我们设计新厂，供应重要的设备，培养和训练人材，供给宝贵的技术资料，并且派遣他们最优秀的专家来具体指导我们工作，这是我们克服技术落后的一个最有利的条件，我们必须充分利用这个优越条件。其次，掌握新技术不能孤立进行，必须和企业中各方面的工作相结合，特别是要同改善管理和增产节约工作，和加强政治思想工作，和肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争相结合，才能保证我们任务的完成。
    在我们的工作中困难是不少的，但是，我们相信只要本着毛主席的指示：努力学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何虚夸和骄傲，我们一定能够克服困难，完成五年计划所规定给我们的任务。
    蔡廷锴代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理所作的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，和李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划是反映全国人民的意志和要求的，是以实行社会主义工业化为中心的，是根据中国共产党在过渡时期的总路线，亦即国家在过渡时期的总任务而制定的。这是一个伟大空前的经济建设计划。这个计划自一九五三年起已经胜利地实行两年了，而且在过去两年实践中已获得了巨大的成就，并取得了宝贵的经验，因而就更加保证了我们的第一个五年计划一定会胜利的完成和超额的完成。我对这个计划表示衷心的拥护，并将尽我的一切力量来贯彻这个计划的实施。
    我深深地认识到，我们伟大祖国的前途是要建成为一个光辉灿烂的社会主义社会。而建设社会主义社会的中心任务，必须是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，而优先发展重工业，更是社会主义工业化的中心环节。第一个五年计划明确地指出了这一正确的方针，强调了这一正确政策，这对全国人民在思想认识上是一个很大的帮助和鼓舞。我们的革命导师列宁一再地指示说：“建立社会主义社会真正的和唯一的基础，只有一个，这就是大工业。”很显然，没有重工业我们就不可能过渡到社会主义，也不可能在现代技术的基础上来改造农业和整个国民经济。
    第一个五年计划也详尽地说明了关于如何解决小农经济同社会主义工业化之间的矛盾。同时也详尽地说明了关于如何解决资本主义经济和社会主义经济之间的矛盾。这些说明和规定，正显示了我们的第一个五年计划是多么全面多么正确的一个伟大的经济建设计划，这一伟大经济建设计划的实行，标志着我们伟大的祖国的前途有无限的光明幸福和美好的远景。
    我们伟大的祖国在解放后的短短三年中，胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作，在这个胜利的基础上，我们才有优越的条件进行大规模的经济建设。从一九五三年起，我们在工业建设方面有了许多显著的成绩，现在我国鞍山钢铁联合企业的改建和新建是日在突飞猛进中；钢铁产量的迅速提高，大大地改变了钢铁工业的面貌。在机器制造工业方面，已经建成或正在新建的工厂有重型机器厂、机床厂、电线工厂、汽车工厂、火车头工厂、拖拉机工厂等等，建设规模都非常巨大。此外，煤炭、电力和石油工业的发展都有惊人的成绩，例如阜新海州露天煤矿生产完全机械化，电铲开挖一下就是五万斤煤。东北的超高压送电线有七百多里长，可以充分供应许多工业城市和厂矿企业的电力需要。玉门石油矿的产量空前增加，一九五三年比一九四九年的产量就增加到接近两倍半。这些说明了我国重工业的基础已逐步地稳固地建立起来了。与重工业发展的同时，我国轻工业和交通运输业也相应地发展。农业、手工业也分别组织起来走向合作化的道路。资本主义工商业通过利用、限制和改造的途径，也逐步走向国家资本主义化了。在商业方面，国营和合作社营商业的发展，保证了计划收购和计划供应政策的实施，保证了市场的稳定。由于以上一切建设事业的飞速进步和显著的成就，几年来就使全国人民的物质生活和文化生活都不断地相应地改善和提高。这就是建设社会主义的良好开端，是第一个五年计划前两年执行的胜利果实，因而获得了全国人民一致的信任和颂扬。同时，反映到国际方面，我国经济建设的成就和和平外交政策是日益得到各国人民的赞美和同情，影响日益扩大，国际地位日益提高。这几年来，我曾多次出席世界和平理事会和世界和平大会，深深感觉到，世界各国人士对于我国一天一天有了正确的认识，并一次一次不同地表示了他们的友谊和深厚亲切的倾向。当然，苏联和人民民主国家的同志朋友们，对于我国的建设成就更是十分欢欣和鼓舞的。
    李富春副总理在报告中曾指出：“我国第一个五年计划，不论那一方面的任务，都是很艰巨的。……在第一个五年计划期间，我国在原来生产力薄弱的基础上进行大规模的建设工作，是不能够不遇到困难的。我们的工作是十分紧张的。在过去的两年多中，我们已经克服了许多困难，完成了许多艰巨复杂的工作任务，但今后我们还会遇到各种困难，工作任务也将更艰巨更复杂。”这说明了我们今后三年的工作任务是比前两年更艰巨更复杂，所遇到的困难也必然不会少的。因此，我们决不能满足于第一个五年计划在前两年胜利执行的情况和所表现的成绩；我们还要精神百倍更加努力地为今后三年的工作任务，作艰苦不懈的奋斗，这样，我们才能全部完成五年计划。我们在过去两年工作中应毋庸避讳地说是存在了一些缺点，也发生了一些错误，我们在基本建设方面、特别是在非生产性的房产建筑方面就有很多很大的浪费现象。在执行粮食统购统销政策方面，也或多或少地发生了一些偏差。这都对国家对人民带来了很大的损失，也对实行第一个五年计划加上了若干困难。不过我们是及时发现了缺点，就及时纠正缺点；及时发现了偏差，也就及时纠正偏差，因而我们在工作任务中通过及时检查工作和及时总结经验教训的办法，才能不断地提高和不断地前进。
    本年二月间，我曾到广州，列席广东省人民代表大会第二次会议。我听到了地方行政首长的报告，以及亲眼所观察的事实，我认为广东省近两年来各方面的建设事业都有很大的进步和发展。过去在土地改革时对华侨家属的一些偏差，以及在粮食征购中的个别缺点也都进行了检查和纠正，因而广东省的人民对于地方政府的措施是热烈拥护的。我希望在广东方面的工作干部，今后更进一步地秉承中央的意旨，根据五年计划的规定，继续努力，完成今后的工作任务。
    我在大会上听了李先念副总理所作“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，其中指出了我们的国家由于实现了一九五四年的预算，在发展国民经济，改善人民生活和巩固国防力量方面已经有了一定的成就，而一九五五年的国家预算的实现又将使我们在这些方面得到进一步的成就。因此，我感觉到这是一个令人兴奋和鼓舞的报告，我们必须保证和一九五四年一样，胜利地来实现一九五五年的国家预算，这样做对于我们完成五年计划的任务是有极大好处的。我完全同意目前全国各地正在深入地贯彻中共中央和国务院厉行节约的指示，以及展开群众性的反浪费斗争。只有这样，才能结合发展生产增加收入，来保证一九五五年度我们国家预算的完全实现，从而也保证了五年计划特别是一九五五年年度计划的胜利完成。
    在伟大的社会主义建设事业的进展中，我深刻地认识到实现五年计划是一种复杂尖锐的阶级斗争。国内外敌人和一切反革命分子是不会甘心于死亡，是必然要作疯狂的垂死的挣扎。最近天津、广东所破获和判处的美蒋特务案件，以及其他各地破获的反动会道门案件，证明敌人正在千方百计地向我们进攻，破坏我们的建设事业。胡风反革命集团就是这样用隐蔽的、伪装的方式方法打进到我们内部来的敌人。我们必须提高政治警惕性，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，击破国内外敌人和反革命分子对于五年计划任何形式的破坏行动。最近对于胡风反革命集团的揭露，是全国人民在同反革命阴谋的斗争中所取得的重大的胜利。我国第一个五年计划是一个伟大的发展国民经济的计划。为了保证这一伟大的五年计划的实现，为了保证我国社会主义建设的完成，我们必须紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，忠实地接受中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导。正如毛泽东主席所说：
  “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。全国人民应万众一心，团结起来，共为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    王一伦代表的发言
    我完全同意关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢各位副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告，并建议大会予以通过。
    黑龙江省是我国重要的工业和农业地区之一，并有丰富的森林资源。在第一个五年计划时期，不论在基本建设、工业、农业和林业生产方面，都担负有重大责任。几年来，我们在工业建设上虽然做了一些工作，取得了一定成绩，但缺点仍然很多。李富春和李先念两位副总理在报告中所说的工业建设中的问题，在黑龙江省都是存在的，对黑龙江省某些单位的浪费现象的批评也是完全正确的。今后我们一定加强领导与监督，保证国家工业建设任务的顺利完成。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：克服农业的发展过分落后于工业发展的矛盾，是五年计划的一个重大任务。我们深深地感觉到，在第一个五年计划中黑龙江省在农业方面负有特别重要的责任。黑龙江省土地面积广阔，现有已耕土地约九千七百五十万亩，还有可耕地近一亿亩；现有耕地土质肥沃，交通便利，水源充足，气候、雨量均适宜于多种作物生产，因而粮产丰富，商品粮占总产量一半；如果可耕地得到全部开发，更可为国家增加相当于黑龙江省现有耕地面积的良田。由于地广人稀，耕作较粗糙，加以小农经济仍占优势，大片荒地尚未开发，因此，农业生产潜力很大。我们有信心，保证国家在第一个五年计划中为我省规定的农业增产指标和农业合作化指标的胜利完成并争取超额完成。
    五年计划报告中提到农业的合作化、农业的增产措施、农业的领导等问题，同样是黑龙江省农业方面的主要问题。去年挂锄以后，黑龙江省农业合作化运动有很大的跃进，参加合作社的农户由占农户总数的百分之七上升到百分之三十六。合作化运动的发展基本是正常的、健康的，百分之九十五是巩固的或可以巩固下来的，绝大多数是能够增产或经过努力可以增产的。目前合作化运动中的主要问题是：自愿互利政策贯彻不够，在入股投资、马价、地租、农具和粪肥作价等方面对中农利益注视不够，另方面也还有某些排斥贫农的现象；在领导上，重社轻组，对合作化运动的方针政策的宣传还不够深透；部分生产合作社骨干较弱，个别社领导不纯。这些缺点，是同领导机关深入下层差、具体领导不够分不开的。黑龙江省宜于耕种而尚未开垦的土地较多，有计划地开垦荒地确实是增加农业产量的重要途径。
  一九四九年以来，黑龙江省采取农场开荒、移民开荒和农民就地开荒等办法，已经开垦了一千三百五十万亩，并有组织地安排了移入农村人口五十万人，对农业增产起了一定作用。李富春副总理报告中提到，国家从缩减非生产性建设的支出和行政机关的经费等方面所节约的资金，将有相当大的一部分用之于荒地的开垦，我们完全赞成这一措施。关于移民开荒问题，根据历年经验，必须进行周密的准备工作，有计划有组织地进行，才能收到良好的效果；相反的，农民自流流入，则问题很多。今年山东向黑龙江省移民一万户，思想与组织准备工作都较充分，工作顺利，移民安心生产，当地群众满意，希望今后在这方面仍能继续得到有关省份的密切协助与合作。
    根据黑龙江省情况，改进农作技术，提高单位面积产量，是有很大的可能性。在第一个五年计划中，农业增产任务绝大部分还需依靠提高单位面积产量来完成，增植玉米、水稻、薯类等高产作物是增加粮食产量的重要措施。
    黑龙江省国营农场很多，这是发展和提高农业生产的极为有利的条件。苏联帮助我国建设的大规模的现代化的国营友谊农场，在苏联专家的热忱指导帮助下，已经超额完成了今年的开荒与播种计划，干部和职工的工作学习热情都很高涨。我们一定要加强对国营友谊农场及其他国营农业的领导，保证办好这些农场，提高生产，积累经验，培养干部，充分发挥其示范作用。
    黑龙江省森林面积广阔，林源丰富，在木材生产上有很大的重要性，对保持水土、调解雨量、含蓄水源和保障农业发展也有很重要的作用。为保证完成黑龙江省在第一个五年计划中农业和林业上所担负的任务，必须大力加强对于森林方面的工作。
    为完成合作化运动和农业生产任务，必须加强地方党政对于农业生产的领导，经常以批评与自我批评的方法克服缺点，反对命令主义和改进干部作风；必须根据中央精简编制的精神，从领导机关中精简出一部分较强的干部去加强下层和县一级的领导力量。
    为实现第一个五年计划，提高政治警惕，防止和粉碎一切反革命分子的破坏活动是一个重要问题。我们去各地视察了解，近年来反革命分子、一般刑事犯罪分子、一些地主和富农分子，对社会主义建设采取了各种手段进行破坏。有些国家机关和企业工作人员，对进行社会主义建设是一个尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争认识极为不足，错误地认为黑龙江省已解放十年了，已经镇压过反革命分子，因而存在着严重的麻痹思想。有些主管部门的工作人员也放松警惕性，应审查的不审查，应严办的不严办，致使反革命分子没有受到应有的打击，给工作上造成了严重的损失。因此，无论在工厂、矿山、农村、林区和机关，都必须时时刻刻地提高革命警惕性，纠正对于反革命活动熟视无睹的倾向，彻底肃清一切反革命分子。
    我们坚决相信，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，积极勤劳地谦虚谨慎地工作，我们伟大的第一个五年计划一定能够胜利的实现！
    王任重代表的发言
    我完全同意中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。
    五年计划这是全国人民奋斗的一个伟大纲领，我们知道五年计划上所规定的数目字有着多么重大的意义：在长江上将建设起第一座雄伟的大桥；在黄河上将建立起巨大的水电站；在武汉、包头将建设起巨大的钢铁联合企业；许多荒地将开垦成良田；我们要自己来制造飞机、汽车、拖拉机、火车头和各种机械设备。正像列宁所指示的，我们要从穷苦的庄稼汉的马上，跨到巨大的机械工业的马上去。为了这样极其伟大的事业，我们人民是不会吝惜自己的血汗和精力的。我们的国家日益繁荣富强起来；我们人民的生活每年都有所改善。我们人民对于社会主义建设事业的进展是十分高兴的；但是国内外的敌人则是很不高兴的。敌人对我们的事业是仇视的，他们的破坏活动是疯狂的和鬼计多端的。在农村中残余的反革命分子和一些反动的地主、富农分子，除了谣言惑众，破坏生产，暗杀干部，制造暴乱等罪恶活动之外，我们还发现了反革命分子和反动分子篡夺乡村党、政领导权力，肆行反动统治的情形。湖北省黄梅县的福胜乡就是一个典型例子。这个乡土改时，发动群众不充分，镇反不彻底，两个罪大恶极的反革命分子刘振声（国民党情报站长）刘钦明（国民党宿松县法院书记）和恶霸地主卢仲威逍遥法外，为所欲为。在他们的指使下，派遣反革命分子张木香，坏分子卢作楫伪装积极，先后打入党内，由于区干部的官僚主义、麻木不仁，为卢作楫、张木香的伪装积极和挑拨离间所蒙蔽，竟让卢担任党支部书记，张担任党支部组织委员。他们在夺取了党支部的领导权力之后，就将原任财粮委员撤换，把伪营长刘文宗的侄子刘国香提升为财粮委员，把反革命分子洪如卓提升为民兵分队长，把流氓懒汉洪丙奎提升为生产委员，把小偷洪云阳和伪军排长张金水提升为治安委员，这样，就在反革命分子刘振声、刘钦明、卢仲威等人的幕后指挥之下实行着反动的统治。
    卢作楫（小商人出身）曾利用副乡长的职权，包庇反革命分子和恶霸地主。一九五○年宿松县公安局派人到该乡逮捕反革命分子刘钦明，卢欺骗来人说：“刘钦明已死，”致未能逮捕归案。该乡恶霸地主石柏生土改时畏罪逃亡江西，卢给他写信证明：“是小土地出租者，不是地主，并无罪恶。”
    张木香流氓成份，从一九四一年任国民党情报站副站长，密报我军情报，并曾勾结土匪杀害我革命同志四人。张木香混入党内之后，当上了信用合作社主任，给反革命分子刘振声贷款十四元，救济款四元七角；让恶霸地主卢仲威代收公粮尾欠二百斤谷以饱私囊；一九五三年支持卢仲威霸占农民胡生荣荒山一块；包庇富农卢柏愿少卖余粮五百斤，评供应时又给了他二百五十斤；对贫农则仇视打击，少发贷款，少给供应粮，罚贫农洪火苟六桌酒席（说洪盖屋压了公有地基）；指使日伪时镇长洪孔壁打符过阴，闹神闹鬼，造成群众恐惶，组织假互助组，如刘振声、张木香等人组成的互助组，是原国民党情报站长、副站长和三个情报员组成，群众称之为“情报组”。他们经常威胁群众，打击积极分子，欺上压下，作恶多端，说什么：“党的决议，谁敢不执行。”转业军人王均海被逼自杀（遇救未死），该乡农民群众敢怒不敢言，暗地议论“党根扎错了，革命革假了。”“别的乡是共产党领导，咱乡还是国民党统治。”群众的眼睛是亮的，黄梅县委派了一个工作组到该乡，深入地发动了群众，终于完全查清了反革命分子的罪恶活动，把卢作楫、张木香开除党籍，送法院处理，逮捕惩办了反革命分子刘振声、刘钦明、恶霸地主卢仲威等人，群众反映“这一次才真正翻了身。”
    像黄梅县福胜乡这样被反革命分子或反动势力篡夺了领导权的乡，并不是个别的，这些地方是反革命分子活动的据点。闹“神水”，闹“仙女”，闹骚乱，闹土匪，逼死贫雇农，杀害干部，多半发生在这些地方。有些较好的乡，也往往有子（自然村）被反革命分子或反动分子操纵着。为了保障农业社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，发展农业生产，必须坚决地再给敌人几次打击。要派出强有力的工作组到落后乡以及落后村（塆）去深入地发动群众，把改造落后乡与镇压反革命的工作结合起来进行。我们在挑选乡村干部时，必须注意挑选那些成份纯洁，历史清白，具有社会主义思想觉悟，工作积极，斗争坚决，联系群众的先进人物；不要被伪装的反革命分子或坏分子所欺骗。反革命分子刘振声指示张木香说：“你误点把工没关系，我负责，我的事情你晓得，将来要变天，我负责。”他们的具体办法是张木香开一次会，刘振声的“互助组”就给他记十分工。残余的反革命分子和一些反动的地主、富农分子正在采取各种办法，向乡村的党组织、政权组织和互助合作组织里钻，有的地方已经钻进来了；也有的是采取“拉过去”的办法，有些反革命分子和反动的地主、富农分子，让他们的老婆、女儿和干部通奸或结婚，请客、送礼、送钱以收买腐蚀干部。金钱美女是敌人向我们进攻的一种危险武器，我们必须加强区乡干部的政治思想教育，提高阶级警惕性，整顿与纯洁党的组织，粉碎敌人的阴谋诡计，以巩固人民民主专政。
    我们知道在我们前进的道路上，不会不遇到许多困难的，社会的敌人和自然灾害是两种困难的来源，还有一种，就是我们工作上的主观主义、官僚主义和麻痹自满，这种错误常常给敌人以方便，给自己造成困难。只要我们去掉主观主义、官僚主义，去掉麻痹自满，提高政治嗅觉，更好地动员和团结人民群众进行斗争，则一切困难都会被克服的，敌人的阴谋诡计都会被粉碎的。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们国家建设的第一个五年计划一定要完成，也一定要争取提前和超额完成。社会主义革命的洪流必将扫除一切障碍，摧毁一切腐朽势力，我们人民一定要建设起自己美好幸福的生活。
    许杰副部长的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告和李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。
      （一）
  　在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中的地质工作，除了必须为第一个五年计划提供必需的矿产资源以外，还要为第二个五年计划的需要作好准备，而在某些矿产方面还需要考虑第三个五年计划的需要。因此我们的地质工作是需要加倍努力的。以地质部在第一个五年计划期间各年的地质勘探工作量的百分比来说，如以一九五二年的地质勘探工作总量作为一百，则到第一个五年计划最后一年即一九五七年的工作总量就为三千八百六十，平均每年递增百分之一百零八，简单地说，就是平均每年都要比上一年增加一倍的工作量。我们的地质工作就必须以这样的速度前进，并在前进中不断提高工作质量，才能满足国家经济建设的要求。
    在五年计划的头两年即一九五三及一九五四两年中，地质部的勘探工作在提交矿产储量方面，已基本上完成了该两年的计划任务；在铁、锰、铜、铅、锡及煤等主要矿种上探明了相当大的储量，为国家的钢铁企业提供了必需的矿物原料及燃料，并在有色金属方面建立了新的巨大的矿物原料基地。除矿产勘探外，一九五四年还组织了大规模的矿产普查工作，找到了一些煤、铬、钼、铅、铜等矿产。两年中还进行了重要的流域地质勘察和各种水利工程的地质勘察工作，为国家的巨大建设工程的设计提供了必需的地质资料。
    五年计划头两年的工作成果是值得我们欣慰的，但我们决不能以此自满。上面谈过，为着适应国家建设迅速发展的需要，我们每年计划的工作量都要比上一年的增加一倍，因此五年计划的后三年即一九五五至一九五七年的任务是更加繁重的。目前正在进行勘探的重要产地将陆续勘探完毕，必须寻找大量的新的后备产地，以保证矿产储量的持续上升。煤、铁、锰、铜、铅等矿产，除了需要继续增长储量外，还必须为工业企业的合理分布建立新的矿物原料基地。至于在工业上所必需的其他黑色金属、有色金属及金刚石、石棉等，以及农业上所需要的磷灰石、钾盐等等矿产，有的工作做得很少，有的尚未开始工作，也必须积极组织力量，加强工作，尽速地取得储量。由地质部担任的天然石油和人造石油方面的资源勘察工作，目前仅是开始，还急待加强。这些重大的工作任务，都需要我们今后加倍地努力来完成。
      （二）
    为着更好地完成我们的任务，必须大力解决当前存在的主要问题和改正工作中的缺点和错误，其中最主要的是下列几点：
    第一、地质工作的各个环节不能互相适应。作为勘探工作先导的矿产普查工作还不能适应勘探的进度，因而不能及时地为勘探提供后备矿产地。大量的群众报矿和已知地点，还没有力量进行广泛检查，同时作为普查先导的区域地质调查还没有大规模地开展，以致矿产普查缺乏可靠的地质的根据而影响普查的进行；大地、地形测量工作则又远远落后于普查及区域地质调查的需要。工作的各个环节像这样不相适应的情况，必然会严重地影响到工作的进度和质量。
    第二、经济核算观点及计划观点薄弱，管理工作不严，浪费现象严重。首先是各项技术规范及各项技术经济定额目前还不够齐全和统一，对已有的规范及定额执行得还不够认真，勘探设计不够全面，有时违反程序，造成返工浪费；有的钻探工作盲目追求数量，忽视质量，以致报废。设计预算制度、财务监督、技术管理及生产责任制只是开始建立，尚待大力贯彻。劳动组织与工资制度尚有不合理的现象，因而劳动生产率尚未得到应有的提高。基本建设上存在着铺张浪费的风气，甚至有的野外工作队对于临时性的建筑也抱着向城市看齐的思想。
    第三、对苏联先进科学及先进经验学习不够，技术及理论水平不高，科学研究工作尚未大力开展，还未能对普查及勘探工作发挥应有的指导作用。几年来在苏联专家热情的帮助之下，工作水平一般地有了提高；但由于对苏联先进经验的学习不够全面和系统，我们目前的技术水平和理论水平还不能满足国家建设日益增进的要求。
    第四、政治思想工作薄弱。对于广大职工和技术人员的思想教育还不深入，资产阶级个人主义的思想作风尚未受到严格的批判和纠正；主观主义和各种唯心主义的思想还没有受到充分的揭发和批判，以致影响各项工作的进展和工作水平的提高。（三）
    为着改进工作，我们必须针对上述工作缺点，努力贯彻下列各项措施：
    第一、除须尽可能地继续扩大已有勘探矿区的外围外，必须在全国范围内大力开展系统的矿产普查、检查工作，发动群众报矿，充分发挥各省工业部门和地质勘察的力量，以求迅速发现大量的石油、铁、煤、铅、磷灰石以及各种金属和非金属矿产地，并进行勘探工作，以保证矿产储量的持续上长。为使普查工作能够顺利开展，必须加速地开展区域地质调查及大地、地形测量工作。与此同时，必须加强地球物理探矿及工程地质与水文地质工作，使各项工作能够互相适应。
    第二、必须大力开展科学研究工作，对已积累的资料加以综合的整理与分析，结合野外勘察，把各种矿产的类型、成矿及分布规律认真地加以研究，以发挥科学研究工作对矿产普查及勘探工作的指导作用。第三、贯彻增加生产，厉行节约的方针，进一步制定和修订各项技术规范及技术经济定额，改善劳动组织与工资制度，加强设计预算及经济核算制度，严格财务监督，提高管理工作水平。第四、为着继续壮大地质工作的队伍，必须加强学校教育与在工作中培养干部的工作。与此同时，必须继续加强在职干部对苏联先进科学技术的学习，有计划地采取干部训练班、业余学习及总结工作等方式，以提高业务水平。第五、认真加强政治思想工作，批判各种资产阶级思想作风，在干部中特别是在技术人员中树立辩证唯物主义的科学工作态度，提高干部的政治警惕，严防暗藏的反革命分子的破坏。在我们祖国辽阔的疆土上，形成各种矿产的各种地质条件是充分地具备着的。所有形成沉积矿床、岩浆矿床及变质矿床的各种地质条件，例如，发育完整的各地质时代的地层，代表各地质时代岩浆活动及地壳运动的各种性质的火成岩体及各种地质构造型式，都在我国有广泛的分布。而事实上，从全国已知的矿产地来看，各种金属和非金属矿床的各种类型，在我国也是已经找到了很多的。所有这些情况都显示我国的矿产资源是丰富的。即以石油来说，在我国的西北、西南等地区有宽广的盆地，其中已到处发现油苗及宜于产油与储油的地层与地质构造；华北平原及东北松辽平原亦曾发现油苗。虽然石油地质是十分复杂的，但我们相信今后在这方面继续努力工作，必能在我国找到比目前更多更大的石油产区。总之，在过去短短几年中的勘探工作已探明了巨大的矿产储量；今后的继续努力必能为我国的矿产资源开辟更广阔的远景。在中国共产党和国务院的正确领导及全国人民的支援和苏联专家的热情帮助之下，通过全体地质工作者坚持不懈的努力，我国的社会主义工业化是能在矿产资源方面获得有力的保证的。
    乐松生代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，以及彭真副委员长关于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的制定，是我国历史上空前未有的一件大事。实行以社会主义工业化为中心的发展国民经济计划，是实现国家在过渡时期总任务的重大步骤，其目标就是要将我国通过几个五年计划以后建成一个繁荣富强的社会主义社会。这是全国人民一致的愿望和要求，只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国，我们才有实现这伟大计划的可能。
    对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造是实行第一个五年计划的重要组成部分，只有限制资本主义经济的盲目性和破坏性，把它逐步纳入国家计划轨道，才能按照社会主义经济法则，有计划、按比例来发展国民经济。北京市几年来在党政领导下，对资本主义工商业贯彻了利用、限制和改造的政策，社会主义改造工作已有显著的成绩。在工业方面，公私合营企业一九五三年原有九户，一九五四年又发展了二十三户，其产值在全市工业总产值中所占比重，已由百分之三点三增加到百分之四点九六。一九五四年国家对私营工业加工订货、收购、包销的总值，在私营工业总产值中所占比重已由一九五三年的百分之五十八点五上升到百分之七十一。公私合营企业由于社会主义成分在企业内部居于领导地位，职工的劳动积极性提高，一般在改进技术、增加品种、提高质量、产量、改善经营管理、降低成本等方面，都有了不同程度的改进。有越来越多的人看到了公私合营企业的优越性，积极创造条件，争取走上这条光明的前途。为了改进私营工业的落后性，一九五四年曾在政府领导、职工协助下，在三百多家私营工厂中，展开了增产节约运动，对提高质量、降低成本、节约原材料、按期按质按量完成国家加工订货等方面，都有了显著的收获。如全市四十九户私营织布厂在增产节约开展一个多月后，甲等品产量提高了百分之五点六，能达到公司质量指标的亦由三户增加到二十户，增加了资方经营信心。今春政府又按照中央指示的统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针，对私营工业的生产和经营进行了安排，协助解决了八十余种原料的供应问题，调整了八十五种产品的工缴利润，增加了任务，改进了成品验收手续等措施后，私营工业的生产已基本上得到了维持，还有了一定的利润。在商业方面，一九五四年初，约有七百户经营主要商品的私营批发商，由于市场情况起了重大变化，不能继续经营，政府根据他们的要求，作了妥善的安排；一九五三年以来，国家先后实行了粮食、油料和棉布的统购统销。这些行业的私营零售商大都给国家经销、代销，纳入了国家资本主义轨道；同时对其他零售商亦逐步按行按业使它们走上经销、代销、批购零销、代批等国家资本主义道路，截止一九五四年十月，全市私营零售商纳入国家资本主义的，已占全市私营零售商总户数的百分之二十三强。这些“代销”“经销”的私营商业，因为已纳入国家经济计划的轨道，货源及销路问题均能得到适当解决，营业情况较为稳定。今春各有关国营公司曾对私营商业的货源和营业额方面予以适当照顾，贯彻了统筹安排的方针，扭转了一部分私营商业的亏累现象。为了改善私营商业存在的各种缺点，在去年冬季曾对全市七百户的私营商业，推动了改善经营管理工作，减少了浪费，建立了必要的制度，为走上经销、代销准备了条件；目前正进一步在私营商业较大户中继续开展改善经营管理工作，以降低商品流转费用，服从国家计划，改变经营作风为主要内容，并在绸布业中实行并店合营的工作。
    在国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造过程中，正如李富春副总理的报告中所指出的：“仍有一些资本家，对社会主义改造抱着消极态度，其中有些人还在进行宪法所禁止的‘危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划’的非法行为，用更巧妙的方法重犯‘五毒’；有些人甚至抗拒或破坏社会主义改造。像这类人，就应该受到舆论的指责和法律的制裁。”我们对这些违法资本家一定要向它们进行严肃的斗争，号召爱国的工商业者与它们划清守法与违法的界限，揭发和检举它们违法事实，并请求政府依法予以制裁。
    为了保证发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的实现，私营工商业者必须衷诚接受社会主义改造，爱国守法，积极经营，努力学习，逐步走上各种形式的国家资本主义轨道；并应深刻认识到社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业越胜利，帝国主义和一切反革命分子，必然要千方百计地破坏我们的建设事业，如同最近揭发的潘汉年和胡风反革命集团所进行的种种阴谋破坏活动，都是我们的死敌。因此，我们私营工商业者应紧密团结在中国共产党的周围，努力改造思想，积极参加粉碎一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，提高警惕，克服消极的一面，不予敌人以可乘之隙；增加生产、厉行节约，为衷诚接受社会主义改造和肃清一切反革命分子、反对国内外敌人而奋斗！
    最后我对于邓子恢副总理所作的“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，感觉到非常兴奋。听到了这个计划的伟大和艰巨以及综合利用后的雄伟和美丽的远景，使我又一次深深感觉到在人民民主的毛泽东时代，是一个把人类理想变为现实的时代，由于黄河的根治和利用，将大大促进社会主义建设事业的进展，造福于人类社会及子孙万代，改变我们伟大祖国的面貌。我为这个史无前例的伟大建设而欢呼！
    陶鲁笳代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长分别向会议所作的报告。
    我国第一个五年计划所规定的工业发展的速度，我们认为是正确的，并感到十分鼓舞。大家知道，“发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件”。现在我想就这个问题发表一些意见。
    我认为五年计划中农业增产要求达到的指标是积极的、可靠的，它和工业发展的需要是相适应的。计划中对农业的投资和所采取的措施也都是适当的。当然，要完成农业增产计划，必须作很大的努力。对困难估计不足而盲目乐观是不对的。但是，有些人对农业增产缺乏信心，因而对工业的发展发生怀疑，这是没有根据的。就山西省的情况来说，完成并争取超额完成农业增产计划的条件是完全具备的。几年来山西省在可耕土地面积没有多大变动的条件下，粮、棉增产的情况是：一九五二年是全面丰收的一年，粮食总产量达到七十六亿多斤，比一九五一年增长百分之二十。棉花总产量达到一亿八千多万斤，比一九五一年增长百分之六十七；一九五三年粮食总产量比一九五二年增长百分之十二，棉花因播种面积缩小，总产量比一九五二年减少了百分之十五，但单位面积产量比一九五二年提高了百分之三；一九五四年虽然约有六分之一的耕地遭受严重灾害，但粮食总产量仍比一九五二年增长百分之七强，比一九五一年增长百分之二十九；棉花总产量比一九五二年增长百分之三，比一九五一年增长百分之七十。如以农业总产值计算，一九五四年比一九五二年增长了百分之十三点六。上述这些数字完全可以说明农业生产的潜在力是很大的。那末，这几年来我们用了些什么办法来发掘这种潜在力呢？概括起来有以下几点：第一，大力发展互助合作运动。一九五二年全省还只有五百四十六个农业生产合作社，参加的农户占总农户数的百分之零点四，参加互助组的农户约占总农户数的百分之五十。发展到今年，全省已有三万一千多个社，入社农户占总农户数的百分之四十一，加上参加互助组的农户数，共占总农户数的百分之七十六。有十六个县基本上合作化了。经验证明，凡是正确地发展合作化的地方，对农业增产的作用最为显著。如壶关县入社农户已达该县总农户数的百分之六十六点四，一九五四年该县粮食总产量，比一九五二年的丰收年成提高了百分之十八点五。第二，改变耕作制度，扩大复播面积，进行土地基本建设，变荒地为良田。由此一九五四年全省农作物播种面积较一九五二年增加了一百万亩，较一九五一年增加了七百八十万亩。第三，有计划地进行水土保持和兴修小型水利的工作。一九五四年全省水田和水浇地共达六百八十二万亩，较一九五二年增加了二百九十万亩。第四，自一九五二年起，我们逐年有系统地总结与推广了各种农作物的丰产经验，诸如使用新式农具，改进耕作技术，扩大优良品种和高产作物的种植面积，提倡合理密植和间作，开展群众性的积肥运动等方面都取得了很大的成效。例如植棉由于推广了劳动模范曲耀离的先进经验，晋南产棉区的单位面积产量自一九五二年以来逐年增长，到一九五四年每亩产皮棉已由一九五一年的三十九斤提高到五十三斤，该专区的曲沃县已达六十五斤。第五，发展多种经济，推广平顺县西沟村和羊井底村农业、林业、畜牧、水利全面结合的经验。在山西省总面积百分之七十以上是山区的情况下，这是增加农民收入和实现农业增产的一个重要办法。以上这些办法，实践证明都是行之有效的。问题只是到目前为止，每一条办法我们还做得很不充分，而且已经做过的工作也还有不少缺点。但由此说明了农业增产的潜在力仍然很大，只要我们把这些办法贯彻得更好，加上国家对农业的投资和技术上的援助，如果没有意外的严重灾害，我们相信争取超额完成农业增产计划是完全可能的。
    对农业增产缺乏信心的人，常常夸大粮食统购统销工作的缺点，以至对粮食统购统销政策表示怀疑和反对。对此，我完全同意陈云副总理的发言。以山西省的情况来说，最近两年来，由于粮食的增产，除供应山西省的需要外，每年尚可外调五亿多斤。今年五月前山西省粮食供应在部分农村中也曾一度发生过紧张现象。情况究竟如何？原因何在？这是要弄清楚的问题。五月下旬在全省整顿统销的工作结束时，我们又组织了九百多个党内外干部深入三百个乡进行了一个月的调查工作。据这三百个乡的材料表明：原来确定为余粮户的共五万零三百六十户，其中不该购而购了的占百分之三，该少购而多购了的占百分之九，二者合计占百分之十二；该多购而少购了的占百分之五。完全合理的占百分之八十三。此外，实际是余粮户而未确定为余粮户的，在三百个乡中约占农户总数的百分之四。三百个乡在粮食统销工作整顿前，原来确定为缺粮户的共三万零八十户，其中不该供应而供应了的占百分之十二，该少供应而供应过多的占百分之十八，该多供应而供应不足的占百分之十二，供应合理的占百分之五十八。此外，实际是缺粮户而未确定为缺粮户的，在三百个乡中约占农户总数的百分之三。整顿后，供应合理了，而缺粮户数却减少了百分之二十，粮食统销量减少了百分之二十三。以上这些材料，说明了过去一个时期粮食统购统销工作虽然发生的问题不少，但总的方面是正确的。部分农村中曾经一度出现过的那种紧张情况，其原因绝不是国家的统销指标少，也不是统购统销政策不能为广大农民所接受。原因是：一方面，由于我们在工作中有缺点。这主要是了解下情差，布置任务还有些不够切实，贯彻政策不很深入，检查工作和纠正偏向不及时，特别是没有认真地注意划清余粮户、自给户、缺粮户的界限，缺粮户中又没有注意划清全缺、半缺、少缺、略缺的界限。事实证明，山西省有二十多个县由于工作做得较好，基本上就没有出现那种紧张情况。另一方面，更重要是部分余粮户由于受了富农思想和粮食投机分子的影响，出现了所谓“思想缺粮户”，他们怕当余粮户而拚命叫喊缺粮：加之地主、反革命分子和其他坏分子乘机造谣破坏、兴风作浪。在这种情况下，我们一部分农村领导干部头脑不够清醒，不去辨别真假缺粮户和敌我界限，而盲目地采取谁叫喊得凶就给谁供应的错误办法；结果，粮食越是供应得多，叫喊缺粮的越多，坏分子认为有隙可乘，因而向我们的进攻也就越是猖狂。所以我们在整顿粮食统销工作中，首先批判了干部中的右倾动摇情绪，坚决地纠正工作中的缺点，同时严厉地打击反革命分子的破坏活动。事实证明：这样做的结果，不仅粮食统销指标大大压缩下来了，特别是广大农民进一步明确了统购统销政策的好处，并且提高了革命警惕性，从而促进了互助合作和增产节约运动的高涨。
    粮食统购统销工作是一件新的工作，我们还缺乏足够的经验。国务院和中共中央关于实行粮食“三定政策”的指示，已经得到广大农民的积极拥护。当然，今后工作中还难免发生一些偏差和问题，但如果因此夸大工作中的缺点而对粮食统购统销政策发生怀疑，那就完全错了。举一个例子来说吧，今年四月，山西省平遥县由于领导干部听到不少人叫喊缺粮而“乱了方寸”，于是由县人民委员会发布了一个错误的通告，规定在全县范围内农民为了换取口粮、种籽和饲料可以互济互借，互通有无，任何乡村或个人都不得予以干涉。这个通告发出后，仅仅在七、八天的时间内，“黑市”泛滥，粮价暴涨，引起了当地农民普遍不满。例如，农民梁巨通在磨面时自言自语道：“毛主席呀！统购统销政策不会变了吧。可能是下边的干部搞错了。”而唯有富农分子和粮食投机商人表示高兴，他们向人笑着说：“粮食市场解放了。”由此造成的混乱、紧张的局面，当我们发觉并立即纠正后，就很快转变过来了。很显然，这个事实证明了对粮食统购统销政策动摇而企图回到资本主义的自由贸易，这只是对城乡资本主义的自由泛滥有利，而对广大农民是有害无利的。所以我们必须坚决贯彻粮食统购统销政策，不能有任何的动摇。李富春副总理在报告中，对粮食统购统销政策所指出的五条好处，我认为完全符合实际情况，我们应当大加宣传。
    现在帝国主义者仇视我国工业化的发展而正在把他们的幻想寄托在我们农业的失败上。然而事实已经证明而且还必将证明，失败的不是我们而是帝国主义者。我们有些人由于对农业增产缺乏信心而想用降低工业化速度的办法来发展农业。显然这种想法根本不符合于我国人民的共同愿望和实际情况。因而它是极端错误的。我们必须反对。
    这次会议，我们听了邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，感到非常高兴。我国人民几千年来根治黄河水害的愿望和梦想不到的开发黄河水利的美好图景，终于在毛泽东时代活现在人们的眼前了。这个伟大的创举更加增强了我们发展工业和农业的信心。毫无疑问，山西人民将和其他沿黄河各省人民一道，按照这一规划的要求充分地担负起自己应尽的责任。山西省山区农民的实践已经证明，实行水土保持不仅是根治黄河的一项根本措施，同时也是山区实现农业增产的中心环节。因此，去年八月山西省人民代表大会通过了全面开展水土保持工作的决议，并制定了十五年的计划。今年已在二十二个县设立了专门机构，派了大批专职干部全面地着手进行这一工作。我们确信黄河综合利用的伟大计划，必将得到千百万劳动人民的热烈拥护和积极支持。因而它是一定能够成功的。
    以发展重工业为中心的五年计划，是我国建设社会主义的具有历史意义的纲领。它具体地生动地向我们展示出我们国家的日益昌盛、人民生活日益改善的美好前景。让我们团结起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约，满怀信心地为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。古大存代表的发言
    我完全拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案、兵役法草案、李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念、彭德怀，邓子恢三位副总理以及彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。我建议大会予以通过，并号召全国人民为我国第一个五年计划的完成、为国家预算的实施、为兵役法的贯彻执行、为根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利这个战胜自然的伟大计划的实现而坚决斗争。
    广东在我国第一个五年计划期中的主要任务是大力发展以互助合作为中心的农业生产，同时积极地有计划地发展地方工业，并加强对资本主义工商业与个体手工业的社会主义改造，以之为国家社会主义工业化的总任务服务。
    广东的农业生产在中央的亲切关怀和大力支持下，通过全省人民的艰苦努力，在全省土地改革完成之后，特别是在地方各级党委与各级国家机关大力加强对农业生产的领导，农业互助合作运动开展起来之后，有了显著的发展。一九五二年粮食总产量达到一百七十九亿斤，超过战前最高年产量百分之八；一九五三年广东农业生产获得了全面的大丰收；一九五四年由于遭到几十年没有的冻灾，杂粮严重减产，但稻谷仍获得了增产。这样就使得广东的粮食情况较之解放前起了根本的变化，广东不但不再是一个缺粮的省份，而且还能调出一定数量的粮食来支援国家社会主义工业化。全省人民特别是城市、工矿区、经济作物区、渔盐区的七百多万人民，无论在新谷上市或青黄不接时，都能保证得到价格平稳的粮食供应。全省人民在发展了工农业生产的基础上逐年改善了自己的生活。
    广东地处亚热带，气温高，雨量足，四季常青，一年三熟，这些都是发展农业生产的有利条件。但是，雨量不匀，虫害严重，台风频仍，各种自然灾害对农业增产造成了严重威胁。仅去年下半年到今年上半年，全省即普遍受到水、旱、风、虫、冻五灾的袭击；特别是去冬严寒，连海南岛都结了冰；今春苦旱，过了立夏还有许多水田无法进行春耕。这些都是几十年来未遇的灾害，以致造成冬耕作物严重失收，春耕几乎无法插秧。当然灾害会增加我们的困难，但是决不能使我们屈服。全省人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，以一万三千个农业生产合作社和八十四万个互助组为核心，进行了规模巨大的抗旱斗争。驻防在广东的人民解放军曾经前后二次全部停止操课六天帮助农民抗旱；全省国家机关、团体、企业、学校的干部、工人、学生有十万人参加了抗旱斗争；而直接投入到抗旱运动中的农民则在六百万人以上。这支抗旱生产大军先后坚持了三、四个月，进行了几十万宗拦河堵、打井挖泉、排咸引淡的工程。从三月中旬到五月上旬，全省所有大小河流除西江外凡是有水流的都进行了拦堵，全省共计拦河二万一千四百余处。其中规模最大的是在五天内胜利完成封锁韩江工程，使韩江水在历史上第一次停止南流出海，而让它改向西去，灌溉榕江平原七十六万亩受旱的水田。全省打井仅粤东、粤中、粤西三个区即达三十五万三千余口，解决了大量水田的保苗、插秧问题。全省动员了二十五万辆以上的龙骨车和一万匹马力以上的动力抽水机（包括湖北省武汉市调来支援的一千匹马力），解决了丘陵地带大量旱田用水问题。珠江、韩江、榕江、鉴江下游农民采用了“堵涌塞窦”“蓄淡拒咸”等办法，克服了海水倒灌入田的威胁。这样，全省人民终于战胜了严重的旱灾，在小满前后把百分之九十以上的水田抢插下去，完成了春耕生产任务，并紧接着加强田间管理，做好追肥、中耕、合理排灌等工作，韩江平原水利工作较好的地区出现了丰收。现在全省已进入夏收大忙时，各地又遭严重水灾，被淹田地数百万亩，灾民百余万人，损失很重。以全省计，上造减产恐不可免。我们深深认识到，要发展广东农业生产，必须战胜各种自然灾害，这是广东全省人民一个十分艰巨的任务。
    在抗旱生产中全省的互助合作组织充分显示了组织起来的优越性，证明了农民一旦组织起来就更可能战胜自然灾害。如全国人民代表大会代表汪汉国同志所领导的农业生产合作社，虽然同样遭到大旱灾，但是他们的社却在抗旱斗争胜利的基础上增产百分之十四点五。这就证明我们发展农业生产必须以发展互助合作为中心是完全正确的。
　我们完全拥护国家在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期中集中主要力量发展重工业的方针。从广东省这几年农业生产发展情况来看，我国第一个五年计划关于五年内农业及其副业增产百分之二十三点三的指标也是完全正确的。广东人民一定为完成这个任务并且为超额完成这个任务而努力。
    广东人民既然要在第一个五年计划期中以大力发展农业生产来为国家社会主义工业化为中心的总任务服务，那末，除了从各方面加强发展农业生产的措施外，还必须做好粮食统购统销工作。这对于国家的社会主义建设与农业的社会主义改造，有极其重要的意义。粮食统购统销的实施不仅使广东粮食市场一直很平稳，保障了全省人民安定的生活，而且使全省人民战胜了几十年来未有的大冻灾和大旱灾。广东今年确曾一度出现粮食供应紧张的现象，使工作受到损失。但是，这绝不是像一些人所说的“是粮食统购统销政策不好，没有照顾农民而引起的紧张”，也不是像另一些人所说的“广东粮食并没有增产，而统购统销却拿走了广东农民的大量粮食”。应当说：引起今年广东粮食供应紧张的主要原因，是我们在执行中央政策的过程中有偏差，没有把统购统销工作做好所致。
    由于几年来，广东全省粮食情况一直很平稳，前年统购任务顺利完成，因此，我们省的领导以至各级干部，思想上存在一定程度的自满情绪。去年夏征夏购没抓紧，只完成全年任务的百分之三十多一点，而在这个时期粮食统销却放任自流，多销了三亿多斤。全年征购任务的近百分之七十集中到秋季来完成，同时为了支援全国灾区，又加了一些任务，合计起来，整个购粮任务是重了一些。而冬耕作物又遇到几十年未见的大冻灾，损失蕃薯、小麦相当于七、八亿斤大米，这就使得一部分农民的口粮确实不够。加上春间苦旱，农民心理紧张，纷纷囤粮备荒，因此今年一月间开始出现了粮食紧张现象。虽然当时省的领导已发现这个问题，大大地放宽了统销指标。但是由于干部存在“重购轻销”的思想，没有认真贯彻“缺多多供应，缺少少供应，不缺不供应”的方针，而采取平均主义的办法，以致一、二、三月份粮食销售虽然大大超过去年同期数量（如今年二月份比去年同期超销百分之四十四点四七），仍未能很好解决问题。四月初，省里一方面布置统销补课，一方面大力压销，想把粮食严重超销的现象扭转过来，但是由于全省投入抗旱生产斗争，统销补课实际上没有贯彻下去，而各地仍然将大量压缩了的指标平均发放出去，因此，从四月中旬到六月初，重灾区如粤西的茂名、电白、阳江等地，杂粮产区如粤东、粤北和海南的一些山区的供应工作确实很紧张。这是我们工作上的一个最大的错误。直至五月下旬全省抗旱生产基本上完成，六月初我们才腾出手来动员一万六千名干部下乡切实搞好“三定”，进一步整顿粮食工作，现在广东粮食情况已完全和缓下来。同时必须指出：就是当时粮食情况表现极端紧张的情况下，根据这次“三定”工作摸底结果，证明真正缺粮而必须供应的只占农村人口的百分之十左右，而百分之九十的人是大体可以过得去甚至是有不少余粮的，他们的叫喊带着很大的虚假性质。
    由此可见：国家的粮食统购统销政策是完全正确的。至于广东粮食统销上一度出现的紧张情况，则是我们工作上的错误和缺点造成的。如果我们在去年统购统销工作上没有前松后紧的现象，今年一月份以后的统销工作抓得紧，而四月份以后又不是采取猛然压销的办法（可以肯定四月份如不采取压销办法，最多超销一亿斤大米，这在广东当前粮食情况说来是可以负担的），那末四五月间的紧张现象就完全可以避免。这是广东全省极深刻的教训，我们已经结合“三定”工作，坚决予以纠正。按照目前第一批已完成“三定”的乡的情况看来，我们有信心把粮食工作做好。粮食统购统销政策是国家在过渡时期的根本措施之一，是不能有丝毫动摇的，至于我们工作中的缺点和错误则是必须坚决纠正的。目前反革命分子猖獗的破坏活动，是值得我们严重警惕的。我们完全拥护常务委员会批准将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判的措施。广东地处国防前线，敌情是严重的。日夜同公开的和隐蔽的敌人斗争着的广东人民，深刻地体会到加强国防力量、加强镇压反革命工作的严重意义。一年来由于我们对镇反工作没有抓紧，反革命分子和各种坏分子十分嚣张，敌人所进行的凶杀、破坏、造谣、诬蔑事件层出不穷，广州市及其他各城市的刑事案件比重也大为增加，严重威胁到广东的社会治安、经济建设和祖国南部国防的巩固。因此，我们要迅速改正工作中的缺点，更紧密地团结全省人民坚决地向公开的和暗藏的反革命分子作斗争，把他们彻底消灭干净，巩固海防边防，为保卫伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业的顺利进行而奋斗到底！
    王国兴代表的发言
    我在会议期间，参加讨论了中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，使我体会到它所规定的基本任务和所确定的中心以及实现计划所采取的具体政策、方法、步骤，都是完整的、切实可行的。特别在规定经济、文化发展的进度上和建设人材的培养与配备上都能根据需要与可能充分注意到按照少数民族地区的具体情况和特点，给予适当的比重和特殊的照顾，这就为进一步地改善我国各族人民的物质生活和文化生活创造了重要条件，使我感到兴奋和鼓舞。我完全拥护五年计划和李富春副总理关于五年经济建设的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，并毫不动摇地去贯彻执行。我建议大会通过这一个伟大而完整的社会主义建设计划。
    我们海南黎族苗族人民并不会忘记，在解放前我们曾受着帝国主义和国民党反动统治的残酷压迫和剥削，根本谈不上工业，就是一些手工业品都是从外地用不等价的交易运进来，全区没有一所学校，差不多是文盲，使我们长期处于饥饿、贫困和落后的状况，因此我们曾对国民党反动统治作过艰难困苦而又英勇顽强的反抗和斗争，最后由于在斗争中找到中国共产党的正确领导，使我们取得了全面解放，建立了人民民主政权，实行了民族区域自治制度。现在我们海南黎族苗族人民和全国各少数民族一样，已团结和生活在我们各族人民不可分离的友爱合作的祖国大家庭里，并从自治区的当前发展阶段逐步地进入国家过渡时期的总轨道，为黎族苗族人民今后的发展开辟了走向社会主义的广阔的道路。海南黎族苗族自治区成立三年以来，在政治、经济、文化各方面都有着长足的进步和发展，我们根据目前的实际需要与可能的条件建立了发电、榨油、砖瓦、石灰、印刷等工厂和粮食、红白藤加工厂等。在发展农业生产上实行农业的社会主义改造，逐渐改变了过去刀耕火种，木犁木耙这种非常落后的耕作技术。不少农民学会了和采取了铁制农具和防治病虫害等，并由政府帮助和群众自力修建或兴建的大、中、小型水利工程共有八千二百六十六宗，使我们减少了风、虫、水、旱的各种自然灾害；加上稳步展开互助合作运动，全区已建立农业合作社一百二十九个，崖县、陵水两县已有三万二千五百零二户组织起来，占两县户数百分之五十九点七；使粮食得到逐年增产。如琼中县一九五四年比一九五三年增产百分之十九点七三。保亭增产百分之二十。在文教卫生方面，到一九五四年止，已有小学五百一十间，中等学校五间，并有文化馆、文化站、电影队、民族歌舞团等，从自治州到县、区、乡共设有卫生院、医疗所、卫生所、保健站、接生站等二百六十一个。去年至今年全区买一万多首耕牛，现在全区农民普遍有衣服穿，如白沙珠江乡东排村农民每人都有两套衣服，大部分有了毛毡、棉被、蚊帐。这可以说，我们海南黎族苗族人民在党和政府的正确领导与极大的关怀帮助下，已经开始过着健康、愉快、自由、幸福的生活。这是中国共产党和毛主席民族政策的胜利，也是国家在过渡时期发展计划经济，实行第一个五年计划中已经在少数民族地区初步体现出来的巨大成绩。
    我们海南黎族苗族自治区，地处亚热带，有优良的自然条件，农作物年可三熟，在山区有着适应工业原料需要的各种矿藏和特产，五指山有丰富的森林，沿海地区又有可开辟的优良港口，海产渔盐业具有远大的发展前途，有了这些优越的客观条件，更加强了我们支援祖国工业化的信心和决心。但我们决不会只看到国家建设的有利条件而忽视了困难的存在，更不应该因既得的成绩而产生骄傲自满，我们要充分注意到少数民族地区由于历史长期遗留下来的过分落后的状况，必须加倍努力学习，提高政治、文化和技术水平，才能适应祖国对我们的要求。同时，我们海南黎族苗族自治区处在祖国国防前线，当我国在进行大规模的经济建设当中，无论是从外部来自空中与海上的美蒋特务或潜藏在内部的反革命分子，必然会千方百计地来破坏我们人民的幸福的事业，我们一定要进一步加强民族之间和民族内部的友爱团结，保持高度警惕性，密切配合国防大军，给予敢于侵犯与破坏建设的一切敌人以有力打击。最后，我一定尽一切力量，团结全体干部，团结黎族苗族人民，继续发扬爱国主义精神，提高生产的积极性和创造性，厉行节约，增加生产，把国家计划所规定给我们的具体任务，依期、依量和依质完成和超额完成，为第一个五年计划的全部实现而奋斗。
    瓦渣木基代表的发言
    中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案、李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，我都完全拥护。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，为我国规划出一幅走向繁荣富强的初步图景，它的实现，将为我国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业打下良好的基础，这也是我们彝族地区获得发展与进步的可靠保证。这个计划的实现，就是全国各族人民的最大利益，也就是我们彝族人民的最大利益，我们一定要尽最大的努力为它的实现而奋斗。
    不能认为五年计划只是汉族地区的事情，不能认为五年计划与我们少数民族地区没有关系或者关系不大。在五年计划草案中，已经根据各少数民族所处的不同地区和具备的不同条件，具体地规定了修建若干铁路、公路，兴建若干机械化农场、拖拉机站、设立学校、卫生机构，进行对资源、交通的勘测和研究等等，这都是直接关系着我们少数民族地区（包括彝族地区）经济和文化事业的发展的。再以我们西康凉山彝族自治州来说，过去几年来，由于中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策的实施，随着整个国家的发展，汉族地区的大力帮助，凉山彝族地区是有显著的发展和进步的。在政治方面，实行了民族区域自治，成长了一批彝族干部，在各级政权中主要是由他们来管理本民族的事务；民族关系得到了很大的改善，彝族内部的许多纠纷得到了调解，不少的“冤家”变为亲人，许多打冤家的战场变为满足人民需要的市场，许多荒地变为良田。在经济方面，几年来由于国家的大量投资（仅无偿发放铁质农具即达四十余万件）和推广先进耕作技术，大大地改变了“刀耕火种”的落后状态，使农业和畜牧业都有了发展。据重点地区的调查计算，一九五四年，主要农作物比一九四九年增产百分之四十左右，畜牧业和副业收入各增加一倍以上，人民购买力提高了二点七倍，其余贸易和交通事业发展也很快，国营商业的营业额一九五四年比一九五一年增加了六十九倍，自治州和各县间的驿道和有线电话已均通达。在文教卫生方面，大部地区设立了民族小学，各县都有了设备较好的卫生院、卫生所和保健站，彝族人民的疾病和死亡率大为减少。由于上述这些变化，使彝族人民深切地体会到祖国大家庭的温暖和毛主席对少数民族的关怀，他们说：“太阳只照白天，月亮只照晚上，只有毛主席才是日夜不落的太阳。”从彝族地区几年来的发展变化看，应当了解，只有我们整个国家在各个方面有了发展，特别是社会主义工业化有了发展，才能保障我们彝族地区在各个方面获得成就，才能促进彝族地区经济和文化事业的发展，才能保证我们少数民族地区能够逐步过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此，五年计划的实现并不是和我们没有关系或是关系不大，而是有着非常密切的关系的。我们彝族人民必须和全国各族人民一道，共同为这一计划的实现而努力奋斗。凉山彝族地区几年来虽然在各个方面都有了不少的发展和变化，但是仍然是一个很落后的地区。要消灭这种落后状态，使彝族社会向前发展，使彝族地区的工作能够适应国家建设的要求，使彝族人民得到彻底的解放，我们必须稳步地、坚决地、积极地沿着社会主义的道路前进。那些满足于现状，认为“进”得已经够了，因而不按照客观可能的条件积极进行工作的思想和态度，不积极耐心地培养帮助彝族干部，或者不积极争取汉族干部对自己的帮助的态度，不积极地发展生产，开展贸易卫生等工作的消极态度，都是不对的。这些态度实际上是使我们的各项工作“稳而不进”，也就将使我们彝族地区长期处于落后的状态，这对彝族人民、对国家的建设都是不利的。这些毛病，我们自己常常会产生的，我们必须注意克服它。当然，不顾少数民族地区的特点，超过客观可能条件的急躁冒进的倾向，也是必须防止和纠正的。总之，我们彝族人民必须坚决地、积极地走社会主义的道路，才有光明的前途。在目前，就应积极地为实行民主改革准备条件，为发展彝族地区的经济、文化，改善人民生活，创造更有利的条件。只有这样，才能逐步地使彝族人民摆脱落后，跻于先进民族的行列，才能逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
   薄一波主任的发言
    发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，是全国人民在中共中央、毛泽东主席和国务院领导下，实现我国过渡时期总任务的重大步骤，它的彻底实现将为我国社会主义工业化奠定初步基础。在这里，我只就五年计划中发展重工业的问题提出一些意见。
    重工业是生产生产资料的工业，它担负着改造国民经济技术基础和扩大社会主义再生产的重大责任。五年计划规定优先发展重工业，并以工业投资的百分之八十八点八来建设重工业，我认为这是完全符合党在过渡时期的总路线的要求和全国人民的根本利益的。解放以来，重工业有了很大的发展，主要产品的年产量，如以一九五二年为一百，到一九五四年的增长情况是：生铁一五六，钢一六五，发电一五一，原煤一二六，原油一八四点一，硫铵一六四点七，水泥一六一；机械产品以生产总值计算，一九五四年为一九五二年的百分之二百。产品品种的增长也很迅速，机械工业几年来试制成功的新产品近二千种，黑色和有色金属工业在一九五四年一年就试制成功二百二十多种。我们已经能够制造六千瓩的火力发电设备，十五万四千伏两万千伏安的单相变压器，切削直径达五公尺的大车床，联合采煤机，机车，谷物联合收割机，新式的全套纺织机械，中型的沿海轮船和内河轮船。我们正在制造一万瓩的水力发电设备，容积一千立米的高炉设备，年产三十万吨的炼焦设备等。
    但是，同国家需要相比较，重工业的水平还很落后。一九五五年钢的计划产量，按人口平均分配每人只有三点六公斤；特别的钢材、大型和高级合金钢材还不能生产；有色金属和稀有金属的品种也不多；机械设备还只能供应国家需要的百分之六十左右，特别大型的、特殊精密的及复杂成套的产品，多半还不能制造；电力和石油的供应都很紧张；地质工作还落后于工业的发展的要求。因此，我们必须大力发展重工业。五年计划期间，重工业各部要建设大批现代化的新企业，并改造现有企业；要炼制几百种优质钢；要制造几千种新产品，包括现在还不能制造的，许多种重型机器和精密机床、飞机、载重汽车和拖拉机等等。到一九五七年生产总值要比一九五二年提高百分之一二六点五。
    在重工业十分薄弱的基础上，要顺利完成上述建设和生产任务，是有许多困难的，我们必须用最大的努力来解决以下几个问题。
    （一）关于重工业的技术改造和掌握新技术问题
    我国重工业的技术基础是十分落后的：企业的规模小，设备陈旧，发展不平衡，机械化的程度低，技术经验缺乏。在这种落后的基础上，要担负起全面改造国民经济技术基础的任务是困难的。因此，在我国工业建设的初期，首先就要着眼于重工业的技术改造，争取经过几个五年计划，把我国重工业的技术水平，逐步提高到一个先进工业国家所应具备的水平，并有计划地逐步地把我国工业、交通运输业、农业的技术基础加以改造。
    在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国建设的一五六项新企业，是实现我国重工业技术改造的首要步骤。这些新企业采用了最新的技术装备，已经具备了先进的技术基础，在建设并掌握了这批新企业之后，就有可能把我国重工业逐步地安放到近代科学技术成就的基础上去。在这些新企业里面的主要问题，是如何掌握新的技术，生产出质量上合乎设计要求的产品，并争取迅速达到设计能力。要做到这一点，就必须认真学习苏联的技术资料，训练技术人员和工人，学会使用新的机器设备，熟悉新设备的操作方法，严格遵照先进设计的要求，掌握全套新生产过程。
    重工业实行技术改造的另一个重要方面，是在原有企业中采用和掌握新技术。重工业各部门应该在充分利用原有设备的基础上，根据发展生产的需要和可能，有计划地增添现代化的技术装备，提高生产过程的机械化程度，逐步以机械来代替笨重的手工劳动。要加强产品设计、试制和试验、检验工作，建立严格的技术秩序，制定完备的技术文件，加强工艺纪律，学会使用新的技术装备和新的操作方法，克服落后的生产习惯。这样，才能提高生产效率，更多地增加产品品种，和不断地改进产品质量。
    采用和掌握新技术，必须依靠科学技术研究工作的指导。为此，重工业各部必须及早建立和健全研究试验机构，逐步地做到能够提出本部门的技术发展方向，使制定技术政策，编订技术发展计划有所依据。
    在实现技术改造的各项工作中，必须全面学习苏联，必须经常总结和运用国内外一切已有的和新创造的先进经验，这是迅速提高技术水平的基本道路。
      （二）开展工业标准化的工作
    标准化是实现社会主义工业化过程中的重要技术政策之一。标准化就是把工业的原料、产品、生产过程、技术条件和质量要求等等方面的各种要素作统一的规定。其中要在全国范围内执行的，用国家法令颁布为国家标准。例如规定了钢料规格的标准，钢铁厂按照标准组织生产，就可以简化品种、大量生产并改进质量。机器制造工厂按照标准选用钢料，就可以简化设计、工艺、材料供应等各方面的工作。
    几年来，有些部门和企业在生产上采用了苏联国家标准的某些部分，起了一定作用，但是由于我国还没有建立起国家标准，所以部门之间在生产技术上，还不能很好地配合。原料供应、设备制造和使用部门之间经常发生供求不协调，使品种复杂，新产品试制的工作量大大增加，技术力量浪费很大。以电压为例，我国沿用着各国的电压等级达三、四十种（苏联只有十种），因此发电、输电、用电以及设备的制造都复杂得多了。因此，推行标准化是简化品种、提高质量、增加生产和促进生产上协作配合的重要前提。
    推行标准化当前的主要问题，首先是成立国家主管标准的机构，根据我国工业发展的具体条件，参照苏联国家标准，逐步地统一制定我国国家标准。制定办法在目前可以由下而上提出，由上而下审定和批准。其次，重工业各部也应相应地设立标准化机构，逐步地推行本专业的标准化工作。推行的步骤，在重工业方面应从主要工业原材料及主要设备开始，先推行基本的标准，后推行专业的标准。
    （三）关于重工业的计划安排、专业化和协作配合的问题
    重工业各部门之间有着密切的联系、地质、冶金、燃料、电力、机械等工业在工作安排上、建厂规模上、建设速度上、品种发展上，都要协调配合，否则必将发生脱节现象。五年计划中对这些问题已作了恰当安排，但是在具体执行计划的过程中，还要随时根据情况的发展，主动地作到年度计划上的配合衔接，这样，才能顺利地完成五年计划。
    在重工业部门中，除国营、地方国营企业外，还有很多公私合营和私营企业。以机械工业为例，一九五三年现代大型机械工业的生产总值中，国营占百分之五十点五，地方国营占百分之十四点八，公私合营占百分之二点九，私营占百分之三十一点八。这些企业在生产和建设上，应做到统筹安排。以往几年中，有些资本家为了追求高额利润，曾盲目扩大生产；某些国营和地方国营企业，因统筹安排不够，也有盲目发展的现象，因而造成品种重复、产品积压、质量低劣，在物力、财力、技术力量上都浪费很大。今后重工业各部门在执行五年计划的过程中，应从需要和可能出发，并依照对私人资本主义工业的社会主义改造方针，在计划上做更具体地安排，使各类企业密切配合。
    计划的合理安排，必须以专业化和协作配合为基础。专业化生产就是对每一个企业，依照产品类似、工艺相近的原则，划定产品范围。这样，企业就可以熟练生产技术，迅速发展品种，采用专用的高效率设备，改善工艺方法，组织大量或大批的生产。另一方面，重工业产品是多种多样的，生产越专业化越需要广泛的协作配合。特别是机器制造业，产品结构复杂，如生产汽车和拖拉机的工厂，要有几十个甚至一百多个工厂来配合。苏联制造汽车和拖拉机，由各协作配合厂供应的零件，占汽车成本的百分之五十以上，占拖拉机成本的百分之三十左右。在我们看来，这样专业和协作配合的水平已算很高了，但苏联还认为是低的，认为影响了技术进步和生产的发展速度。
    列宁认为：生产社会化的发展，社会劳动的日益专门化，和独立工业部门的日益增加，是社会主义生产方式的最重要前提之一。随着我国重工业的发展，一批一批新企业投入生产，企业日益需要向着专业化的方向发展，专业分工和协作配合必将更加广泛和复杂，因而加强这方面的工作愈益重要。
    几年来，国家按照专业分工的原则，已经建立并将继续建立一些新的工业部门，同时，各工业部门也已按照专业分工的原则，划定了大部分企业的专业方向，并组织专业化生产，这是完全正确的和必要的。但是，还有一部分工厂没有确定专业方向，或是确定了专业方向，还未组织专业化生产。还有一些工厂，片面地强调专业化生产，不愿意接受协作任务，有富余能力也不肯承揽杂活。也还有一些工厂总想把自己搞成全能的工厂，样样都要自己做，要求建立车间、增添设备，而不考虑和其他厂协作配合。
    今后为了进一步加强专业化和协作配合，要采取下列措施：第一、根据国家需要，制定长远的品种发展计划，从而确定企业的专业方向；第二、根据需要和经济合理的原则，组织专门性质的工厂，例如专门的铸造、锻造以及生产标准件的工厂等；第三、编好地区的协作计划，把部门的协作和地区的协作有计划地结合起来；第四、建立制度，设置专管机构，解决专业化和协作配合上的各种问题。为了贯彻以上措施，还必须在思想上提倡全局观点，整体观念，反对本位主义倾向。
      （四）改进企业管理，贯彻增产节约，提高劳动生产率
    第一个五年计划期间，新建企业投入生产的还不多，生产计划主要还靠原有企业来完成。因此，原有企业的技术改造和经营管理的改进是有重大意义的。只顾建设新企业，不重视利用原有企业，不设法发挥原有企业的生产能力是错误的。几年来经验证明，原有企业的潜力还很大，只要积极学习苏联先进经验，接受群众的合理化建议，不断改进企业管理，就能大大地提高生产能力。例如全国平炉钢的生产，如果落后企业都能达到先进企业的生产定额，一年就可多出十七万吨钢，相当于现在产量的百分之六点五。
    重工业各部的企业管理工作，几年来虽有很大改进，但是缺点还很多。正如李富春副总理所指出的，不少企业只完成了产值指标，没有完成产品的品种和质量指标，没有完成提高劳动生产率和降低成本的指标；在编制生产计划时要求产值和数量比较明确严格，而对品种、质量和成本则不很注意。拿钢铁来说，大家重视的是吨数、产值，对出产新品种却注意较少；拿机械制造业来说，在计算完成国家任务时，往往也是按所生产的数量、产值，不是按所生产的机器、零件和部件的品种、数量和质量来统一核算。生产中忽松忽紧、前松后紧的现象还很普遍，不少企业在上旬只完成月计划的百分之二十，中旬完成百分之三十，下旬则完成百分之五十。生产中的浪费现象也很严重：我国制造机床和动力机械的金属利用率仅达百分之四十五点五，在苏联机器制造业的金属利用率是百分之六十到八十。非生产人员过多，一九五四年底，重工业、燃料工业、第一机械工业三个部所属企业非生产人员的比例，已上升到百分之二十六。设备利用率很低，切削机床和锻压设备全年实际开动的台时，还达不到应开动台时的百分之六十。工时定额还不先进，不少企业还是用估工办法或经验统计定额，因而不能反映先进工人的成就和提高劳动生产率。推行计件工资的工作也很迟缓。
    克服上述缺点，除了前面说的要采用和掌握新技术外，还必须加强计划工作和经济工作，以提高劳动生产率和经济效果，保证全面完成国家计划和增产节约任务。第一、要克服不能均衡生产的各种原因，努力做到均衡生产，减少非生产工时，积极消灭加班加点的现象，防止设备事故和人身事故，加强劳动纪律。第二、更好地利用现有生产面积，增加机器开动台时，提高设备利用率，充分发挥生产能力，反对轻易废弃原有设备的倾向。第三、改进定额工作，逐步采用先进的经济技术定额，以提高计划的先进性。改进工资工作使工资政策能够促进劳动生产率的不断提高。第四、大力精减工业行政机构和非生产人员，充实生产单位。第五、加强经济活动分析和会计监督，通过计划指标的全面考核来揭露缺点，揭发浪费，揭露企业领导工作中的主观主义和官僚主义。
      （五）关于培养技术力量问题
    重工业的规模逐渐扩大，新建企业陆续投入生产，这都是需要技术力量的。这几年来，技术力量增长的速度虽然不小，但仍赶不上需要。目前技术力量的情况是：数量不够，工种不平衡，而且技术水平不高。重工业各部技术人员平均只占生产工人总数的百分之五点七；生产工人中低级工多，高级工和特种工不足，工人平均技术等级只有三点二级到三点五级，而苏联为我国设计的新企业一般要求都在平均四级以上。由于技术力量不足，就使新产品增加还不够快，产品的质量不够好，新企业和新设备不能很快掌握，技术研究工作不能很快展开。因此，培养和壮大技术力量，是当前必须解决的一个关键问题，今后应当：提高学校教育的质量，有计划地派遣人员出国学习；加强职工的业余教育，并注意组织转业的高级和中级干部学习技术，提高他们的业务领导能力；合理地使用现有技术人员，加强对他们的政治思想教育，并通过建立科学技术研究机构，培养科学技术人材。
    以上就是重工业部门在五年计划中所必须解决的几个主要问题。由于我们基础差，经验不足，解决这些问题是会遇到许多困难的。但是，我们有苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，有广大工人、技术人员和干部的高度建设热情，只要我们认真地学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验，做好企业的政治思想工作，把政治思想工作和经济工作很好地结合起来，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，重工业在五年计划中的任务是一定能够完成的。
    在建设重工业的繁重工作中，我们还必须保持高度的革命警惕性。反革命分子对我国工业建设是极端仇视的，重工业又是国家的经济命脉、工业化的基础，他们首先要破坏的就是重工业。胡风反革命集团和潘汉年叛国案的事件及其他许多破坏事件，已向我们敲起了警钟，因此，我们全体重工业部门的职工，在紧张建设工作的同时，还必须学会和一切敌人作斗争的本领，坚决把暗藏的反革命分子清除出去，以保卫祖国重工业建设的成果。
    各位代表，发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划已经制定出来了，让我们在毛泽东的旗帜下，和全国人民一起，和全体工人阶级一起，共同努力为胜利完成和超额完成这个伟大五年计划而奋斗吧。
