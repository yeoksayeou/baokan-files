    The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education Issue Several Regulations
    Colleges and Universities Should Properly Handle the Re-enrollment of Demobilized Construction Soldiers
    The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education recently issued several regulations on colleges and universities properly handling the re-enrollment of demobilized construction soldiers.
    The regulations point out: For demobilized construction soldiers (including those transferred to civilian work, the same below) who enlisted in the army from colleges and universities and who request to return to colleges and universities to study, colleges and universities should fully recognize the great political significance of properly resettling demobilized construction soldiers, understand their eager desire to study and participate in construction, and actively handle their re-enrollment issues. They should show great concern for them and resolutely prevent and correct the erroneous attitude of indifference and discrimination, and the irresponsible behavior of procrastination and shirking responsibility.
    The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education stipulate: Those who enlisted in the army from colleges and universities after liberation (referring to the date of liberation of the location of the school, the same below), and who still request to return to the original school to study after demobilization, the original school should allow re-enrollment. If the original school has been adjusted or merged, it should follow the original department (specialty), and the relevant school after the adjustment or merger should allow re-enrollment. If the original school still exists, but the original department (specialty) has been adjusted to another school, the original school should be responsible for introducing them to the school where the department (specialty) has been adjusted and allow re-enrollment. If the original school still exists, but the original department (specialty) has been discontinued, and the individual is willing to study in other existing departments (specialties) of the original school, they should be admitted to the appropriate grade after a placement test. If the individual is unwilling to re-enroll in other existing departments (specialties) of the original school, they can take the college entrance examination and apply for other schools and majors. Those who enlisted in the army from colleges and universities after liberation, but have acquired specialized skills during their time in the military and are not suitable for re-enrollment in the original department (specialty), the original school should review their expertise (after a placement test) and admit them to an appropriate major. If the original school does not have a suitable major to admit them to, the original school can contact relevant schools and transfer them to a suitable school according to transfer procedures. If there is no suitable school to transfer to, they can take the college entrance examination and apply for a comparable school. Those who enlisted in the army from colleges and universities after liberation, and who request to continue their studies after demobilization, but the original school has been discontinued and cannot be re-enrolled, the individual can apply to a college or university of the same or similar nature as the original school near their home, through the introduction of the Transfer to Civilian Work Construction Committee, the Civil Affairs Department, or the original military unit. After a placement test, they will be admitted to the appropriate grade. If their level is too poor to keep up with classes, they can reapply for re-enrollment or take the college entrance examination after studying on their own for a year.
    The regulations point out: Students who were in the first or second grade of a five-year vocational school before the reorganization of departments when they enlisted in the army, should return to a corresponding secondary vocational school if they wish to continue their studies after demobilization. Those who studied in a five-year vocational school up to the third grade or above should be handled according to these regulations. Because colleges and universities have undergone great changes in teaching content and methods due to teaching reforms, the courses studied by demobilized construction soldiers before enlisting in the army cannot be connected with the current courses in colleges and universities. Re-enrollees should generally start from the first grade. If the individual requests to continue studying in the original grade, they should be placed in the appropriate class after a placement test; those who fail the placement test should still start from the first grade.
    The regulations point out: When applying for re-enrollment, demobilized construction soldiers must be introduced by the Transfer to Civilian Work Construction Committee or the regiment or equivalent unit of the military unit above the county level (district for large and medium-sized cities). Colleges and universities should contact the Transfer to Civilian Work Construction Committee or relevant departments that introduced their demobilization or transfer to civilian work to understand the situation, and conduct a health examination according to the provisions of the "National College Enrollment Health Examination Method". Those who are not suitable for re-enrollment in the original department (specialty) can be transferred to other departments (specialties) in the school. Those who are not suitable for continuing their studies in colleges and universities should be advised to recuperate, receive medical treatment, or participate in work in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Resettlement of Demobilized Construction Soldiers". For those who cannot re-enroll immediately due to health reasons but are expected to recover in the short term, the school can retain their student status for one year from the date they apply for re-enrollment. Those who cannot re-enroll after the deadline will no longer have their student status retained. Colleges and universities should accept applications for re-enrollment from May 1st to the end of July each year (may be extended to the end of August in 1955). Re-enrollment procedures will not be handled in the middle of the semester.
    The regulations point out: Demobilized construction soldiers who have served in the military for more than three years will be entitled to the treatment of People's Scholarship for Cadres Transferred from Other Work after re-enrollment.
    The regulations believe that those who enlisted in the army from political schools such as North China University, Revolutionary University, and short-term training classes, those who have been transferred to civilian work for more than one year after demobilization, and those who have been admitted to colleges and universities but have not registered, cannot be handled according to these regulations.

    高等教育部和教育部作出几项规定
    高等学校应妥善处理复员建设军人复学问题
    高等教育部、教育部在最近发出关于高等学校妥善处理复员建设军人复学问题的几项规定。
    规定指出：从高等学校参军的复员建设军人（包括转业军人，以下同此），他们要求仍回高等学校学习，高等学校应该充分认识妥善安置复员建设军人的重大政治意义，体贴他们迫切要求学习、参加建设事业的心情，主动地积极地处理他们的复学问题。高度地关怀他们，切实防止和纠正那种冷淡歧视的错误态度和拖延推诿的不负责任行为。
      高等教育部和教育部规定：凡是解放以后（指学校所在地的解放日期，以下同此）从高等学校参军，复员后本人仍要求回原学校学习者，原校应准予复学。如果原校已经调整、合并，则应跟随原来肄业的系（科），由调整、合并后的有关学校准予复学；如果原校虽存在，而原来肄业的系（科）调整到其他的学校，应由原校负责介绍到该系（科）调整后的学校，准予复学；如果原校虽存在，而原来肄业的系（科）已经停办，本人愿意到原校现有的其他系（科）学习，应经过编级考试编入适当年级复学；如本人不愿意到原校现有的其他系（科）复学，可自行参加高等学校招生考试，另行报考志愿的学校、专业。凡是解放以后从高等学校参军，但因在部队期间已学有专门技术，不宜在原肄业的系（科）复学者，原校应审查其专长（经过编级考试）编入适当的专业，准予复学。如果原校确无适当专业可以编入，可由原校与有关学校联系，按转学手续，转入适当的学校，准予复学。如无适当学校可转，可自行参加高等学校招生考试，另行报考相当的学校。凡是解放以后从高等学校参军，复员后本人要求继续学习，而原校已停办，不能复学者，本人可经转业建设委员会、民政部门或原部队介绍，就近向原来肄业学校性质相同或相近的高等学校申请复学，经过编级考试，编入适当年级复学。如果程度过差，不能跟班学习者，可经过本人自修一年后，再行申请复学或另行报考高等学校。
    规定指出：参军时如系院系调整前五年制专科学校一、二年级的学生，复员以后本人愿意继续学习者，应到相当的中等专业学校复学；如在五年制专科学校肄业至三年级以上者，按本规定办理。由于高等学校经过教学改革，教学内容、教学方法已大有改变，复员建设军人参军以前所学课程和现在高等学校的课程无法衔接，复学者一般应由一年级从头学起。如果本人要求衔接原来年级继续学习，应经编级考试插入适当班级；编级考试不合格者，仍应从一年级学起。
    规定指出：复员建设军人申请复学时，须经原籍县（大中城市为区）以上的转业建设委员会或部队的团或相当于团的单位负责介绍，高等学校应与其介绍复员、转业的转业建设委员会或有关部门取得联系，了解情况，并按“全国高等学校招生健康检查办法”所附各项规定，进行健康检查。对不宜于复学原肄业系（科）者，可调整到本校其他系（科）复学；对不宜于在高等学校继续学习者，应劝其按“复员建设军人安置暂行办法”的有关规定休养、医治或参加工作。对于因为健康关系不能立即复学而可望在短期内治愈者，学校可以从他提出申请复学的那天起，继续保留学籍一年，逾期不能复学者，不再保留学籍。高等学校于每年五月一日到七月底（一九五五年可延至八月底）以前受理申请复学工作。学期中途，不办理复学手续。
    规定指出：凡参军满三年以上的复员建设军人，复学后得享受调干人民助学金待遇。
    规定认为：从华北大学、革命大学等政治学校和短期训练班性质的学校参军者，复员转业后已经参加工作一年以上者，曾经考取高等学校，但未注册入学者，都不能按本规定办理复学。（新华社）
