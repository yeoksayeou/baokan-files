Why Spend So Much Money on Greening a Factory?
By Our Reporter Zhu Bo

　　The State-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as the Northwest No. 3 Cotton Factory) is divided into a production area, a welfare area, and a green area. The production area is surrounded by rows of plane trees. Adjacent to the factory buildings are thirty-two flower beds of different sizes and styles, planted with dozens of kinds of flowers and trees. Here, almost every place where flowers and trees can be planted is planted with them. Even near the warehouses, garages, pump rooms in front of the factory buildings, and water towers, flowers and trees have been planted or orchards have been built.

　　The welfare area is divided into nine large courtyards, which people call villages. According to the original plan, each village (courtyard) would be an orchard. Some villages would be apple orchards, some peach orchards, some grape orchards, some pear orchards, some apricot orchards... Each orchard would be surrounded by a hedge (using holly or juniper). Later, because some people raised objections, it was changed to a large flower bed in the middle of each village (courtyard). Around the welfare area, there are three rows of trees, one row of poplars, one row of pagoda trees, and one row of plane trees.

　　Most of the flowers and trees in the production area and welfare area have already been planted. Only the greening work in the green area has not yet started because the ground is occupied by some temporary buildings built during the construction of the factory. But just looking at the greening plan for the green area is shocking enough.

　　The green area is located between the welfare area and the production area, covering more than two hundred acres of land. Here, there are plans for forty-two flower beds and groves of various sizes, an open-air theater, pavilions, fountains, etc. On the road from the welfare area to the production area, there will be two green hedges, two rows of pagoda trees, and two rows of plane trees. It is said that this will prevent all factory workers from seeing the sun when they go to and from work.

　　In the No. 3 Northwest Cotton Factory, hundreds of kinds of flowers and trees have already been planted. In terms of flower types, there are varieties of plum blossoms alone, such as Great Pearl Plum, Winter Plum, Large Leaf Plum, Butterfly Plum, Prunus triloba, Prickly Plum, Spring Plum, Yellow Jasmine Plum, Red Plum, and Green Plum. There are also jasmine, crape myrtle, Cymbidium, Staghorn Fern, cycad, tuberose, weeping willow, golden bell, etc., no less than a hundred kinds. In terms of trees, there are fruits like quince, Cotoneaster, apple, cherry, pomegranate, crabapple, betel nut, hawthorn, peach, pear, and grapes. There are also various pines and cypresses, boxwood, holly, Chinese toon, etc.

　　Most of these flowers and trees were purchased from other places. The General Affairs Section sent many people to Huangshan Slope and Jigong Mountain in Henan, as well as Nanjing and other nine places to specifically purchase flowers and trees. At Huangshan Slope, they bought a total of fifty to sixty thousand trees, which took thirteen train cars to transport. In Nanjing, they bought various precious flowers and trees, including boxwood balls costing fifty yuan apiece, and variegated junipers costing fifty yuan apiece (some of the more valuable flowers and trees have been returned due to repeated prohibitions from the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau). The flowers and trees they purchased in Xi'an and Lintong were also very valuable, including small-leaf boxwood balls costing ninety yuan apiece, bluish dogbane costing sixty yuan apiece, and grape seedlings costing twenty-six yuan apiece. The purchase of these flowers and trees cost more than 24,000 yuan, the packaging and transportation of the flowers and trees cost more than 5,400 yuan, and flower pots, planting tools, etc., cost a total of more than 30,000 yuan.

　　To carry out greening work, the factory has set up two staff members, three gardeners, and eighteen flower workers, of which eleven are temporary workers.

　　It is said that this is only a preliminary plan for greening work. Even this preliminary plan is already very extravagant. Why does the Northwest No. 3 Cotton Factory spend so much of the state's construction funds on greening work? The leading staff of this factory believe that a new type of socialist enterprise must meet "socialist standards" in everything. Greening work is no exception. This is obviously very wrong. It should be known that according to the principle of practicing strict economy, in the construction of socialist enterprises, production buildings and equipment can be better, but non-production buildings and equipment must be as simple as possible. Welfare facilities, greening work, etc., must be handled gradually with enterprise bonus funds after the factory starts production. The Northwest No. 3 Cotton Factory's behavior of wasting state construction funds should be taken as a warning by all newly built enterprises.

### 为什么花这样多钱去绿化工厂呢

　　为什么花这样多钱去绿化工厂呢
　　本报记者　朱波
    国营西北第三棉纺织厂（以下简称西北国棉三厂）分为生产区、福利区和绿化区。在生产区的周围是清一色的梧桐树。紧靠着厂房的四周，共有三十二个大小和样式不同的花坛，花坛里栽种几十种花木。在这里，只要能栽种花木的地方差不多都栽种了花木，连仓库、汽车库附近，厂房前边的水泵房和水塔附近，也都栽种了花木或修成了果树园。
    福利区分九个大院，人们把这些院叫村。按原来计划，每一个村（院）就是一个果树园。有的村是苹果园；有的是桃树园；有的是葡萄园；有的是梨树园；有的是杏树园……每个果树园周围都栽一道绿篱（用冬青或刺柏）。后来因为有人提出反对意见，才又改为每个村（院）中间修一个大花坛。在福利区的四周，共有三排树，其中一排是白杨；一排是杨槐；一排是梧桐。
    生产区和福利区的花木大部分已经栽种好了。只有绿化区的绿化工作，因为地面被建厂时的一些临时建筑物占着，直到现在还没有开始。但是只要看一看绿化区的绿化图，也就够惊人的了。
    绿化区在福利区和生产区之间，共有二百多亩地。在这里，计划有四十二个大小花坛和树丛，有露天剧场、亭子、喷水池等。从福利区到生产区的路上，将有两道绿色的篱笆，两排杨槐和两排梧桐。据说，这样可以使全厂职工上、下班时都不见太阳。
    在国棉三厂里，已经栽种上的花木就有数百种。从花的种类上来看，仅梅花就有大珍珠梅、腊梅、大叶梅、蝴蝶梅、榆叶梅、刺梅、春梅、黄莉梅、红梅和绿梅等。其它还有茉莉花、紫薇、千首兰、鹿角掌、铁树、晚香玉、圣柳、深碧连翘等不下百余种。在树木方面，仅果树就有木瓜、栒橘、苹果、樱桃、石榴、海棠、槟榔、莎果、山楂、桃、梨和葡萄等。其它还有各种松柏、黄杨、冬青、香椿等。
    这些花木大部分是从外地购买来的。总务科派许多人到河南的黄山坡和鸡公山以及南京等九个地方去专门采购花木。在黄山坡，他们共买了五、六万棵树，用十三个火车皮才运完。在南京，他们买了各种名贵花木，其中有五十元一株的黄杨球；有五十元一株的洒金柏（还有一部分贵重花木，由于西北纺织管理局的一再制止已退了货）。在西安和临潼等地，他们购买的花木也非常名贵，其中有九十元一棵的小叶黄杨球；有六十元一棵的翠兰松；有二十六元一棵的葡萄树苗。买这些花木共用了二万四千多元，花木的包装和运费用了五千四百多元，连同花盆、栽花木工具等共用三万多元。
    为进行绿化工作，厂里专设两个工作人员，三个花匠和十八个花工，其中十一个是临时工。
    据说这仅仅是绿化工作的初步计划。就是这个初步计划，已经是很铺张的了。西北国棉三厂为什么把这样多的国家建设资金去花费在绿化工作上呢？这个厂的领导工作人员认为：新型的社会主义企业一切都要达到“社会主义标准”。绿化工作也不例外。这显然是十分错误的。应该知道：根据厉行节约的原则，在社会主义企业的建设中，对生产性的建筑和设备可以好一些，但对非生产性建筑和设备则必须尽可能地简朴一些，福利设施、绿化工作等则必须在工厂开工生产以后用企业奖励金来逐步办理。西北国棉三厂这种浪费国家建设资金的行为，一切新建的企业都应该引以为戒。
