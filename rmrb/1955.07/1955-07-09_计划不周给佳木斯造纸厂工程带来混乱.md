Poor Planning Leads to Chaos in Jiamusi Paper Mill Project
Gan Xu, Yi Shan

The newly built Jiamusi Paper Mill is a large-scale comprehensive factory, including the paper mill, copper wire mesh factory, and thermal power plant. It is one of the key projects in China's first Five-Year Plan. However, since construction began in 1953, this project has suffered from poor planning and many problems in construction management, resulting in significant waste and seriously affecting the completion of the plant construction plan.

The Jiamusi Paper Mill is a large-scale and technically complex project, but to date, there is no overall plant construction plan. There is no unified plan or arrangement as to which projects should be started first and which should be started later. When formulating annual plans, some projects are proposed and construction is carried out hastily. As a result, the state's investment cannot achieve economic results, and the plant construction work is constantly backtracking. Just as the factory's third dedicated line was about to be laid, it was discovered that the line would affect the construction of the main material warehouse and building material warehouse, so it had to be completely dismantled. After the 25-meter-high concrete water tower in the workers' village was built, it was discovered that the water quality was poor, so it had to be abandoned and water was drawn from a source a kilometer away. The heating equipment in the workers' village dormitory built in 1953 was originally designed with steam radiators, but after it was installed last year, the Ministry of Light Industry and the Paper Industry Administration Bureau believed that steam radiators were not suitable for the climate conditions in Jiamusi and decided to convert them all to hot water heating; the two "Lancashire" boilers that had only been in use for a year also had to be dismantled and re-modified. What is particularly intolerable is that after the hot water heating packages in three dormitory buildings were installed, it was discovered that the hot water boiler had not yet been built. Winter was approaching at that time, and it was too late to build a hot water boiler, so the hot water packages in the three buildings had to be dismantled again and re-fitted with steam radiators; and this year they will be converted to hot water packages again. In this way, the newly built buildings have to be repeatedly chiseled twice, seriously affecting the service life of the project. According to preliminary statistics, the loss from this rework alone amounted to 19,400 yuan. The sewer project in the workers' village dormitory built in 1953 had to use seepage wells for drainage because the plan was not finalized for a long time. In winter, the workers' village was simply turned into a skating rink. The foundations of the buildings have begun to sink due to sewage erosion, seriously affecting the service life of the buildings. Other projects such as sewage pumping stations, sewers, and heating pipes have all changed their plans several times, and even a simple canteen has moved several times, wasting more than 5,000 yuan in material transportation costs alone.

Due to the lack of a comprehensive plant construction plan, the Second Engineering Office of the Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Light Industry, which contracted the paper mill project, was almost completely shut down in the first half of 1954. It was not until May that the Ministry of Light Industry decided to temporarily build a 10,000-square-meter dormitory. While the dormitory project was under construction, the drawings for the copper wire mesh factory arrived at the construction site. Because it was an industrial construction project, it had to be started immediately, and the Second Engineering Office of the Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Light Industry transferred a large number of workers to the copper wire mesh factory construction site; the dormitory project, which was under construction, had to be paralyzed. However, the copper wire mesh factory project was not well prepared for construction due to the urgency of time, and it was suspended after construction began due to lack of materials. As a result, both the dormitory project and the copper wire mesh factory project were delayed until winter without being completed, resulting in a huge waste of manpower and financial resources. After entering winter, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry believed that the task in 1955 was heavy, so in order to concentrate efforts on building the factory building project, it decided to advance the 20,000-square-meter dormitory project for 1955 to be constructed in the winter of 1954. However, due to the lack of sufficient preparation for winter construction, materials were prepared while construction was underway, and budgets were made while construction was underway. After construction started, it fell into extreme chaos. In the early stage of construction, three shifts were adopted. Due to the large number of people and the small working surface, one person worked and two people "visited." In particular, due to insufficient insulation equipment, shutdowns and idleness often occurred. For example, the sand and gravel heating shed was small in area and could only accommodate a limited amount of sand and gravel, which was far from meeting the construction needs, and construction was often interrupted. Once, after 96 workers arrived at the construction site, the block stone heating had not reached the specified temperature, and the workers had to return to the dormitory. Sometimes, the workers were working, and the heating materials were used up, so they had to stop working. In order to complete the task, the leaders took the approach of working overtime and adding people. There were 1,600 people in November, and the number increased to 2,400 in December. However, the more people there were, the more chaotic the management became, the more passive the work became, and the leaders had to "treat the head when it hurts, and treat the foot when it hurts," and the progress of the project was delayed again and again. The project, which was originally required to be completed last winter, has not yet been handed over.

Due to the lack of an overall plant construction plan and chaotic construction management, quality accidents have also occurred frequently. Quality accidents have occurred in every project, including the canteen project, the single dormitory project, and the family dormitory project. The quality of the factory building project is also similarly poor. The 4,000-square-meter road in the copper wire mesh factory was crushed by more than one-third shortly after being paved due to insufficient compressive strength of the prefabricated parts, and the entire road was rebuilt. The asphalt roof of the factory building drips oil when exposed to the sun, and the oil felt paper also drips down with it. Although it has been remedied now, it has affected the life of the roof.

The construction of the Jiamusi Paper Mill is so chaotic, but the Ministry of Light Industry and the units directly responsible for construction have not learned a lesson from this. It was originally thought that the task this year was heavy, so the 20,000-square-meter dormitory project was rushed to be constructed last winter in order to "concentrate efforts on building the factory building project" this year. Who knew that the plan this year was still not finalized, and it was delayed until May, and the construction preparation was not done well, and it took the old path of hasty construction. For example, the steel workers of the central laboratory project at construction site 202 entered the construction site on May 6th. Because there were no tools, they could not work for more than ten days. Due to the inaccurate plan of the central laboratory project at this construction site, too few block stones were prepared. In order to simply catch up with the progress, it did not hesitate to replace the block stones with high-priced concrete. The fire truck garage project at construction site 203 started on May 17th. Due to insufficient allocation of masonry workers, the operation plan was delayed by four or five days, and the daily progress only reached about 0.2%. The construction period of the car garage project was delayed by five days due to the untimely supply of drawings and the unpreparedness of materials. The average daily progress of the fifteen projects in the factory area and the front factory area only reached about 0.2%. Due to the late start and slow progress of these projects, the second batch of projects, which was originally planned to start in July, will inevitably be delayed until August or September to start.

In the past two years, the waste caused by poor project quality, idleness, and rework, according to verifiable accounts, amounted to 139,000 yuan. In addition, waste in other aspects is also serious. For example, at the beginning of winter construction, grass bags could have been used for insulation, but 15,000 reed mats were purchased at a higher price. After use, they were not well kept and were left to be exposed to wind and rain, and most of them have been damaged. The loss amounted to 45,000 yuan. Many construction machines were also not fully utilized due to poor management.

The Jiamusi Paper Mill construction project has been in a state of chaos, firstly because the Ministry of Light Industry lacks a comprehensive plan for the paper mill construction project, and the Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Light Industry has not given enough attention to such an important project. It only placed a Second Engineering Office with a very incomplete organization here for construction, but rarely provided specific help, so that problems in construction have not been solved for a long time. Secondly, the leaders of the Jiamusi Paper Mill Preparatory Office and the Second Engineering Office of the Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Light Industry lack a sense of responsibility to the national construction. Instead of diligently studying their business and doing a good job in construction management, they are afraid and complain when encountering difficulties. They rarely take the initiative to solve problems in their work. A director of the preparatory office once said: "The top is shouting chaos, and the bottom is shouting chaos. What can I do if I don't shout!" In addition, both Party A and Party B lack an overall concept and cannot cooperate well with each other, and many difficulties that can be overcome have not been overcome. Finally, the Jiamusi Paper Mill Party organization has not carried out regular and effective supervision of the construction work, which is also an important reason why the chaos and waste in the construction cannot be overcome in time.

　　计划不周给佳木斯造纸厂工程带来混乱
　　甘徐　奕山
    新建的佳木斯造纸厂，是一座规模很大的综合性工厂，它包括造纸厂、铜网厂、热电站三项工程，是我国第一个五年计划中的重点工程项目之一。但是，这项工程从一九五三年动工修建以来，由于计划不周和施工管理方面有很多问题，不但浪费很大，而且严重地影响了建厂计划的完成。
    佳木斯造纸厂，是一个规模很大、技术很复杂的工程，可是直到目前为止，还没有一个总的建厂计划。究竟那些工程应该先开工，那些工程应该后开工，都没有统一的规划和安排。制定年度计划时，只是草率地提出一些项目就进行施工。结果是国家的投资不能发挥经济效果，建厂工作不断走回头路。厂内第三条专用线刚要铺轨，发现线路影响主要材料库和建筑材料库施工，只得全部拆除。工人村二十五公尺高的混凝土水塔建成后才发现水质不好，只得废弃不用，另从相距一华里的地方接源。一九五三年修建的工人村宿舍采暖设备，原来设计全部都是蒸汽包，但在去年安装好后，轻工业部和造纸工业管理局又认为蒸汽包不适于佳木斯的气候条件，决定全部改为温水暖汽；刚刚使用一年的两台“兰克夏”锅炉也得拆除重新改制。特别令人不能容忍的是，有三栋宿舍温水暖汽的暖水包安好后，才发现还没有修温水锅炉，当时冬天已经迫近，再修温水锅炉已来不及，只好又把三栋楼房的暖水包拆掉，仍旧改装成蒸汽包；而今年还要改为暖水包。这样，新建成的楼房就得反复凿两次窟窿，严重地影响了工程寿命。据初步统计，仅这一项返工损失就达一万九千四百元。一九五三年修建的工人村宿舍下水道工程，由于计划迟迟不决，下水道工程只好用下水渗井进行排水。到了冬天，工人村简直变成了滑冰场。建筑物基础因受污水浸蚀，有的已开始下沉，严重地影响了建筑物的寿命。其他污水泵房、下水道、暖汽管道等工程，都曾变更过几次计划，就连一个简单的食堂也搬了几次家，仅材料转运费就浪费了五千多元。
    由于缺乏通盘的建厂规划，承包造纸厂工程的轻工业部工程公司第二工程处，一九五四年上半年几乎完全陷于停工状态。到五月份轻工业部才确定暂时修建一项一万平方公尺的宿舍。在宿舍工程正紧张进行施工的时候，铜网厂的图纸到达了工地，因为是工业建设项目，必须立即动工修建，轻工业部工程公司第二工程处又把大批劳动力都调往铜网厂工地；正在紧张进行施工的宿舍工程只好陷于瘫痪状态。但铜网厂工程因时间仓促，施工准备工作没有做好，开工后就停工待料。结果，宿舍工程和铜网厂工程都拖到冬天还没有竣工，造成了人力、财力的巨大浪费。入冬以后，轻工业部造纸工业管理局认为一九五五年任务大，为了便于集中力量修建厂房工程，决定将一九五五年两万平方公尺的宿舍工程提前在一九五四年冬季施工。但是，由于对冬季施工没有进行充分准备，边施工，边备料，边作预算，开工后，即陷于极度混乱状态。开工初期采取三班施工，因人多工作面小，形成一人干活两人“参观”。特别是由于保温设备不足，经常发生停工、窝工现象。如砂土加热棚，面积狭小，容纳砂石有限，远远跟不上施工需要，施工经常中断。有一次，九十六名工人到工地后，块石加热还没有达到规定温度，工人只好重返宿舍。也有时工人正在干活，加热材料用完了，只好停止工作。领导人员为了完成任务，就采取了加班加点和增加人的办法。十一月份是一千六百人，十二月份就增加到二千四百人。但是，人越多，管理越混乱，工作越被动，领导人员只好“头疼医头，脚疼医脚”，工程进度一拖再拖。原来要求去年冬季竣工的工程，直到现在还不能交工。
    由于没有总的建厂计划和施工管理混乱，质量事故也不断发生。食堂工程、单身宿舍工程、家属宿舍工程没有一处不发生质量事故。厂房工程质量也同样低劣。铜网厂四千平方公尺的马路，因预制件抗压力不够，铺完不久就被压碎了三分之一以上，全部返工重建。厂房沥青屋面，太阳一晒就往下流油，油毡纸也随之往下淌，现在虽已补救，但已影响屋面寿命。
    佳木斯造纸厂的建设是这样混乱，可是轻工业部和直接负责施工的单位，却没有从这里吸取教训。原来认为今年任务大，因而把两万平方公尺的宿舍工程抢在去年冬季施工，以便今年“集中力量修建厂房工程”。谁知到今年计划还是迟迟订不下来，拖到五月，施工准备还没有做好，又走上仓促开工的老路。例如，二○二工地中心化验室工程的钢筋工，五月六日就进入了工地，因为没有工具，十来天都不能工作。这个工地的中心化验室工程，由于计划不准确，准备的块石太少，为了单纯赶进度，竟不惜以高价的混凝土代替块石。二○三工地消防车库工程五月十七日即开工，因砌石工调配不足，使作业计划拖后了四、五天，日进度只达到百分之零点二左右，汽车库工程因图纸供应不及时，材料没准备好，使工期较计划拖延五天。厂区，厂前区十五项工程，平均每日进度只达到百分之零点二左右。由于这些工程开工晚，进度慢，原计划在七月份开工的第二批工程，势必拖到八、九月才能开工。
    两年来，由于工程质量低劣，窝工、返工造成的浪费，据有账可查的，就达十三万九千元。除此而外，在其他方面的浪费也是严重的。如冬季施工开始时，本来可以用草袋子保温，但却以较高的价钱购买苇席一万五千张，用完后也不很好保管起来，任凭风吹雨淋，现已大部损坏。损失达四万五千元。很多施工机械也因管理不善，没有充分发挥作用。
    佳木斯造纸厂建厂工程，所以一直陷于混乱状态，首先是由于轻工业部对造纸厂建厂工程缺乏通盘筹划，轻工业部工程公司，对这样一个重要的工程也没给予足够的重视，只是放了一个机构很不健全的第二工程处在这里施工，却很少进行具体帮助，以致施工当中的问题长期得不到解决。其次，佳木斯造纸厂筹备处和轻工业部工程公司第二工程处的领导人员缺乏对国家建设负责的精神，不是兢兢业业地钻研业务，把施工管理工作做好，而是遇到困难就畏惧、埋怨。很少主动地去解决工作中的问题。筹备处一位主任曾说：“上面喊乱，下面喊乱，我不喊有什么办法呢！”另外甲乙双方也缺乏整体观念，不能相互很好配合，许多可以克服的困难也没有克服。最后佳木斯造纸厂党组织对于建厂工作没有进行经常地有效的监督，也是使得建厂中的混乱和浪费不能及时克服的重要原因。
