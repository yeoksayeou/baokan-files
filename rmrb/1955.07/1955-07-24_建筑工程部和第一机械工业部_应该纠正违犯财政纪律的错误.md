The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the First Ministry of Machine Building Should Correct Errors in Violation of Financial Discipline
Editor's Note:
    The following are excerpts from two reader letters exposing the erroneous practices of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the First Ministry of Machine Building in violating financial discipline. Upon investigation by the Financial Supervision Department of the Ministry of Finance at the request of this newspaper, the readers' reports were confirmed. Strictly enforcing financial discipline is an important guarantee for the rational use of state funds and the elimination of waste. However, according to our understanding, these two units are not the only ones violating financial discipline. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the First Ministry of Machine Building correcting their erroneous practices, we hope that other agencies will also check and prevent similar phenomena. The financial departments should also strengthen financial supervision to stop all acts violating financial discipline.
    (I) Editor Comrades:
    I am a staff member of the First Mechanical Construction Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. I want to expose an inappropriate practice of the Ministry of Construction Engineering when using state investment.
    Our company, formerly the Second Engineering Office of the Mechanical Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, was established in May 1953. Because our company's office buildings and dormitories were insufficient, in 1954 the ministry agreed to our company building 2,000 square meters of office buildings and 3,000 square meters of dormitories, with a total investment of more than 540,000 yuan. After this plan was approved by the state, design began in August of last year, construction began in October, and it has now been completed.
    However, these houses, which were urgently needed by our company and designed according to our company's needs, were taken over by the ministry with a formal official document after completion. As for our company's housing problem, the ministry's solution was to invest more than 470,000 yuan in the 1955 basic construction plan to build another 5,000 square meters of houses in the name of our company's mechanical station.
    I think this practice of the ministry is wrong. Our company is a construction enterprise. The ministry uses our company's name to build houses for other units to use, which is actually equivalent to embezzling state investment in industrial construction. This is a violation of financial discipline and should be corrected quickly.

    (II) Editor Comrades:
    In 1953, the First Ministry of Machine Building decided to establish a primary school for the children of its cadres. Fearing that the application for basic construction funds and land from the state would not be approved, the First Ministry of Machine Building adopted a "sleight of hand" method, using the name of the Beijing Industrial Cadre School (a secondary technical school affiliated to the ministry) for basic construction. Last year, this primary school had already built more than 8,200 square meters of houses, with an investment of more than 1.2 million yuan; recently, a dining hall with an area of more than 600 square meters has been under construction. These expenses are listed separately in the ministry's accounts under the names of the Beijing Industrial Cadre School and the primary school for the children of cadres; but when reporting to the state, they are all listed under the name of the basic construction of the Beijing Industrial Cadre School.
    Some staff members of the First Ministry of Machine Building have raised objections to this practice that violates financial discipline. However, these opinions have not been valued by the responsible personnel related to this matter. Although these responsible personnel know that this practice is wrong, they are unwilling to correct it immediately and want to wait until the dining hall is built before considering it. I believe that the state financial supervisory authority should investigate this matter and make appropriate handling.

### 建筑工程部和第一机械工业部  应该纠正违犯财政纪律的错误

    建筑工程部和第一机械工业部
    应该纠正违犯财政纪律的错误编者按：
    下面摘要发表的两封读者来信，揭发了建筑工程部和第一机械工业部违犯财政纪律的错误做法。经本报委托财政部财政监察司检查，证明读者反映的情况是确实的。严格地执行财政纪律，是使国家资金得到合理使用和杜绝浪费的重要保证之一。但是，据我们了解，违犯财政纪律的还不只是这两个单位。因此，除了建筑工程部和第一机械工业部应该纠正他们的错误做法以外，希望其它机关也要检查和防止类似的现象。而财政部门也应该加强财政监察工作，以制止一切违犯财政纪律的行为。
    （一）编辑同志：
    我是建筑工程部第一机械施工公司的工作人员，我要揭发建筑工程部使用国家投资时的一种不妥当的做法。
    我们公司原名建筑工程部机械管理局第二工程处，在一九五三年五月才成立。因为我们公司的办公房屋和宿舍都不够，一九五四年部里同意我们公司建筑二千平方公尺的办公楼和三千平方公尺的宿舍，投资共五十四万多元。这个计划经国家批准以后，在去年八月开始设计，十月开始动工，到现在已经完工了。
    但是，这些为我们公司所急需、而且也是按着我们公司的需要设计的房屋，建成后却由部里用正式公文通知接收了。至于我们公司的房屋问题，部里的解决办法是：在一九五五年基本建设计划里，又用我们公司机械站的名义，投资四十七万多元，另建五千平方公尺的房子。
    我认为部里这种做法是错误的。我们公司是一个建筑企业，部里用我们公司的名义建筑房屋，而给其它单位使用，实际上等于挪用国家对工业建设的投资。这是一种违犯财政纪律的做法，应该迅速得到纠正。　　　　　　　　　　　　施修荫
    （二）编辑同志：
    第一机械工业部在一九五三年决定办一个机关干部子弟小学。这个小学需要建筑房屋，第一机械工业部怕向国家申请基本建设的经费和土地时会批不准，就采取了一种“偷天换日”的办法，用北京工业干部学校（部里所属的一个中等技术学校）基本建设的名义。这个小学去年已经建筑了八千二百多平方公尺的房子，投资一百二十多万元；最近又在修建一个面积六百多平方公尺的食堂。这些费用的开支，在部里的账上分列为北京工业干部学校和机关干部子弟学校两项；但在向国家报告时全都列在北京工业干部学校基本建设的名下。
    对于这种违犯财政纪律的做法，第一机械工业部有一些工作人员曾经提出过意见。但是这些意见并没有得到同这件事情有关的负责人员的重视。这些负责人员虽然明知这种做法是错误的，却不愿意马上纠正，想等食堂盖好以后再说。我认为，国家财政监察机关应该对这件事进行检查，并作出适当的处理。　　　　　　　　　　陈仙华
