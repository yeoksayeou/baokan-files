Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 4th: According to TASS, "Unità" published on the 3rd the resolution of the Italian Communist Party's leadership on the domestic political situation caused by the government crisis.

　　The resolution stated that the Party's leadership calls on public opinion to pay attention to the serious domestic unrest and economic and social struggles. This struggle is an indicator of the increasing difficulties experienced by the working people. The resolution pointed out that the people and progressive groups within pro-government political movements are demanding the government crisis be resolved as quickly as possible, and in a way that can ease international and domestic tensions, while immediately resolving the most pressing living and working problems of the Italian people.

　　The resolution pointed out that the most conservative and reactionary groups controlling Italian politics are using all sorts of conspiracies to delay the resolution of the crisis in the face of these demands, and to prevent Italy from adopting a new political line, which is to end the cold war among Italians and provide the necessary conditions for a turn to the left, which would help eliminate obstacles hindering the cooperation of democratic forces.

　　The resolution calls for a large-scale, powerful, and unified movement to destroy the evil conspiracy, so that all political groups and political leaders recognize the full strength of the people's will. The resolution said that the people demand the establishment of a government that can solemnly guarantee the implementation of a clear and concrete plan – even if it is only a moderate plan – in accordance with the constitution to meet the most basic and pressing needs of the country.

　　The resolution said: The task of the Communists, in close alliance with their Socialist comrades, is to demand that the public – from the Catholic camp to people and groups inclined towards the Republican and Social Democratic parties – take action within their respective parties to ensure the success of the progressive movement, and to sever all ties with parties and leaders who speak directly for the interests of large monopoly capital and landlords. The resolution calls on all Communist Party members to hold the banner of Italian people's unity in their own hands.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome: The Italian government crisis has lasted for twelve days and has not yet been resolved. Segni, a Christian Democrat entrusted with the task of forming a cabinet, has repeatedly asked Italian President Gronchi to extend the deadline for forming a cabinet.

　　The original date set for submitting the final answer was June 30.

　　Segni attempted to form a government in the usual way with a coalition of four parties (Christian Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, Republican Party, and Liberal Party), but encountered great difficulties. Reuters reported that these four parties "still have sharp differences in terms of government programs and distribution of positions." After much compromise, Segni requested that the deadline for his cabinet formation activities be extended again for two days, until the 5th before submitting a final answer.

　　These days, the Italian people are increasingly demanding a change in Italy's domestic and foreign policies, and opposing continuing on the old path of Scelba. Countless letters and telegrams from all over the country poured into the President, Parliament, and leaders of various political parties, demanding that the new government implement social reforms and maintain peace and safeguard Italy's national independence.

　　意共领导机构发表关于国内政治局势决议
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：“团结报”三日刊载了意大利共产党领导机关关于政府危机所引起的国内政治局势的决议。
    决议说，党的领导机关要求舆论注意国内的严重不安和经济和社会斗争。这种斗争是劳动人民所经受的困难增加的一个指标。决议指出，人民和亲政府的政治运动内部进步的集团正要求尽可能迅速地解决政府危机，并且要求解决的方式能使国际和国内紧张局势得到缓和，同时还立即解决意大利人民的最迫切的生活和工作问题。
    决议指出，控制着意大利政策的最保守和反动集团，在这些要求面前正以各种形式的阴谋诡计来拖延危机的解决，并且阻止意大利采取一种新的政治路线，这就是结束意大利人之间的冷战和提供向左转的必要条件，这种向左转是有助于消除妨碍民主力量合作的障碍。
    决议号召以一个大规模的、强有力的和统一的运动来摧毁罪恶的阴谋，使一切政治集团和政界领袖认识人民意志的全部力量。决议说，人民要求成立一个能够庄严地保证按照宪法实行一项明确具体的计划——那怕只是一项温和的计划——来满足国内最基本和最迫切的需要的政府。
    决议说：共产党人的任务是在同社会党同志结成紧密的联盟的情况下，要求公众——从天主教阵营一直到共和党和社会民主党倾向的人和集团——在他们各自的政党内采取行动以保证进步运动的成功，并且要求同直接替大垄断资本和地主的利益发言的政党和领袖割断一切联系。决议要求全体共产党员把意大利人民团结的旗帜掌握在自己手里。
    据新华社讯　罗马消息：意大利政府危机已经持续了十二天还没有解决。受命进行组阁尝试的天主教民主党人塞尼已一再要求意大利总统格隆基延长组阁的期限。
    在原先预订提出最后答复的日期六月三十日。
    塞尼企图按以往方式组织一个四党（天主教民主党、社会民主党、共和党和自由党）联盟的政府，但是遭到了很大困难。路透社消息指出，这四个党派在政府“纲领和职位分配方面仍然存在着尖锐的分歧”。经过许多折冲以后，塞尼要求把他的组阁活动的期限再次延长两天，到五日前再提出最后答复。
    这些日子，意大利人民愈来愈广泛地要求改变意大利的内外政策，反对继续走谢尔巴的老路。无数的信件和电报从全国各地涌向总统、议会和各政党领袖，要求新政府执行社会改革和维护和平、保障意大利民族独立的政策。
