Higher Education Institutions Should Learn a Lesson from the Hu Feng Incident
　　Zhang Jian
　　From the three batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily" regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we can see not only that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique attempted to seize our Party's leadership in the field of literature and art, but also that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique tried every means to infiltrate their core members into some higher education institutions to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. For example, Xie Tao, one of the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, disguised himself as a "Marxist-Leninist theorist" and won the trust of the leadership, infiltrating into the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of the Renmin University of China as the deputy director. On the one hand, he acted as a makeup artist to prettify the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique; on the other hand, he used flowery words to spread counter-revolutionary ideological poisons and carry out anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities. Furthermore, other core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, such as Jia Zhifang, Lu Dian, and A Long, at the Chinese departments of Fudan University and Nankai University, often used counter-revolutionary literary fallacies and works to deceive students who lacked experience in class struggle and literary cultivation. Even the head of this counter-revolutionary clique, Hu Feng himself, would go to some art colleges and Chinese departments of comprehensive universities to give reports whenever he had the opportunity, attempting to win over and poison more young students. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique also infiltrated higher industrial schools. For example, the notes of Comrade Lin Mohan's communication at the Party group of the Higher Education Department mentioned in Ouyang Zhuang's letter to Hu Feng were secretly copied from the president (a Party member) of Nanjing Institute of Technology by Wu Renxiong, a Hu Feng element who had infiltrated the institute. The facts listed above should already be a profound warning to all teachers, students, and staff in higher education institutions.
　　Why did the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique infiltrate higher education institutions to carry out sabotage activities? The reasons are: First, higher education institutions are the main places in our country for cultivating high-level specialized talents for socialist construction. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements also understand that accumulating funds and cultivating cadres are two important links in China's socialist construction, especially heavy industry construction. In order to undermine the socialist construction cause of the Chinese people, they will try every means to sabotage the cultivation of high-level construction talents. Second, the students educated in higher education institutions are mostly young students who lack experience in class struggle and political cultivation, and these young people will soon participate in various national construction undertakings. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements deeply understand the principle that "youth is the future of the country." They vainly attempt to spread counter-revolutionary "pus" to all parts of our great motherland through these young people, in order to finally ruin our socialist revolutionary cause. Third, the foundation of ideological and political work in some higher education institutions is relatively weak, and higher education institutions have close relationships with various national construction undertakings, from which many state secrets can be stolen; some leading Party comrades are also suffering from paralysis, carelessness, and liberalism, sleeping with tigers all day long without being awake, which makes it easy for counter-revolutionary elements to exploit loopholes.
　　Currently, there are some erroneous views circulating in higher education institutions, such as: As long as teaching work is done well, the task is completed; in the highest institutions of learning in the new China, besides scholars, there are only pure young people, how can there be any counter-revolutionary elements; the task of teaching reform is extremely heavy, where is the time to clean up counter-revolutionary elements; "Scholars revolt, it won't succeed in three years," even if there are a few unarmed counter-revolutionary elements in the school, it doesn't matter, and so on. These erroneous views make it easy for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to carry out anti-Party and anti-people sabotage activities.
　　The Party's timely exposure and crushing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has given us a concrete and vivid lesson. We must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, not only to always heighten our vigilance against open counter-revolutionary elements, but also to especially learn to be good at identifying hidden counter-revolutionary elements like the Hu Feng clique, to sound the alarm for everyone sleeping with tigers, and help them cure their paralysis, carelessness, and liberalism. Everyone must fully realize that: on the one hand, because the Chinese people have achieved a great victory in the revolution under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and will achieve even greater victories, under the bright daylight of the people, all counter-revolutionary elements do not dare to carry out open counter-revolutionary activities in an undisguised manner, and have to adopt more insidious and vicious double-dealing tactics in order to infiltrate into our interior to carry out so-called "heart-digging war" sabotage activities. On the other hand, because the revolution is constantly achieving victories and various construction undertakings are constantly achieving successes, it is easy to be overwhelmed by victory, thinking that the world is peaceful and you can rest easy, fostering paralysis, carelessness, and liberalism, giving the enemy a chance to exploit. We must wipe our eyes brighter and thoroughly criticize the paralyzing thought that focuses on teaching all day long and ignores the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements in the school, and be good at waging a resolute struggle against all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.
　　Secondly, precisely because national higher education institutions are one of the important targets for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements to carry out sabotage activities, and our Party's leadership force in schools is still relatively weak, and in the past some departments and disciplines in some higher education institutions had become strongholds for the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to carry out activities, therefore, today higher education institutions urgently need, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Committee, and on the premise of not hindering the completion of the state's teaching plan, to mobilize and organize more than 90 percent of the teachers, students, and staff through the study of this Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, in a guided and planned manner, to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique elements and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements. This is an important step in purifying the ranks of higher education institutions and improving the quality of education.
　　Thirdly, we must vigorously strengthen the Party's leadership and the school's political and ideological work, and wage a resolute struggle against all tendencies of paralysis, carelessness, and liberalism; we must establish and strengthen personnel and confidentiality systems to plug all loopholes that hidden counter-revolutionary elements can use to infiltrate higher education institutions.

    高等学校应从胡风事件中吸取教训
    张健
    从“人民日报”所揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料里，不仅可以看到胡风反革命集团企图夺取我们党在文艺方面的领导地位，而且也可以清楚地看到胡风反革命集团曾经想尽办法将他们的骨干分子打入到部分高等学校里去进行反革命的阴谋破坏活动。例如胡风反革命集团的骨干分子之一的谢韬，伪装成一个“马克思列宁主义理论家”而骗取领导上的信任，钻进中国人民大学任马克思列宁主义教研室副主任，一面充当胡风反革命集团涂脂抹粉的化装师的角色；一面又到处花言巧语地来散布反革命的思想毒素，进行反党反人民的罪恶活动。又如胡风反革命集团的另一些骨干分子贾植芳、芦甸、阿垅等在复旦大学和南开大学中文系，经常用反革命文艺谬论和作品来欺骗缺少阶级斗争经验和文艺修养的同学。就连这个反革命集团的头子胡风本人，一有机会就到部分艺术院校和综合大学中文系去作报告，企图拉拢和毒害更多的青年同学。胡风反革命集团也打入高等工业学校，例如欧阳庄给胡风信中提到林默涵同志在高教部党组传达的笔记，就是混入南京工学院的胡风分子吴人雄从该院院长（党员）处偷抄的。上面所列举的事实，已经值得高等学校全体师生员工同志们深加警惕的了。
    为什么胡风反革命集团要打入高等学校里来进行破坏活动呢？其原因就在于：一，高等学校是我们国家培养社会主义建设高级专门人材的主要场所，胡风反革命集团及其他一切暗藏的反革命分子也都懂得：积累资金和培养干部，这是我国社会主义建设特别是重工业建设的两个重要环节，他们为着破坏我国人民的社会主义建设事业，就会想出千方百计来破坏关于高级建设人材的培养工作。二，在高等学校受教育的大都是缺乏阶级斗争经验和政治修养的青年同学，而这些青年不久即将参加国家各种建设事业，胡风反革命集团及其他一切暗藏反革命分子深知“青年是国家的未来”的道理，他们妄想通过这些青年将反革命的“毒脓”传布到我们伟大的祖国身体上各个部分去，以便最后搞垮我们社会主义革命事业。三，在一部分高等学校中思想工作和政治工作的基础比较薄弱，而高等学校又和国家各种建设事业有着密切的关系，从这里可以偷窃国家不少的机密；有些党员领导同志又患着麻痹大意和自由主义重病，成天同老虎在一起睡觉而不清醒，便于反革命分子钻空子。
    目前，在高等学校中流行着一些错误看法，例如说：只要搞好教学工作就算完成任务啦；在新中国最高学府里，除了学者就是纯洁的青年，有什么反革命分子啦；教学改革任务异常繁重，哪有时间来清理反革命分子啦；“秀才造反、三年不成”，学校里即使有几个不拿枪的反革命分子，也没啥关系啦，等等。这些错误看法，就便于胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏反革命分子进行反党反人民的破坏活动。
    党及时地揭发和粉碎了胡风反革命集团，具体而又生动地给我们上了一次大课。我们必须从胡风反革命集团事件吸取教训，不但要时刻提高对于公开反革命分子的警惕，而且要特别学会善于鉴别类似胡风集团的暗藏反革命分子，要向一切同老虎一起睡觉的人敲起警钟，帮助他们医治好麻痹大意和自由主义重病。每个人必须充分认识到：一方面由于中国人民在中国共产党正确领导下，已经取得了革命的伟大胜利，并将要取得更伟大的胜利，在人民的光天化日之下，一切反革命分子是不大敢于明目张胆地进行公开的反革命活动，不得不采用更阴险更毒辣的两面派的手法，以便打入到我们内部来进行所谓“挖心战”的破坏活动。另一方面，由于革命不断地取得胜利和各种建设事业不断地得到成就，容易被胜利冲昏头脑，以为天下太平，可以高枕无忧了，滋长着麻痹大意和自由主义，给敌人可乘之隙。我们必须把自己的眼睛擦亮一些，要彻底批判那种成天忙于教学忽视校内反革命分子进行破坏的麻痹思想，要善于同一切暗藏的反革命分子进行坚决的斗争。
    其次，正因为全国高等学校是胡风反革命集团和其他一切暗藏反革命分子进行破坏活动的重要目标之一，目前我们党在学校里的领导力量还比较薄弱，过去有部分高等学校少数系科曾经成为胡风反革命集团骨干分子的活动据点，因此，今天高等学校就迫切需要，在当地党委和人民委员会统一领导下，在不大妨碍完成国家的教学计划的前提下，有领导、有计划地通过对这次胡风反革命集团事件的学习，动员和组织百分之九十以上的师生员工，来肃清胡风反革命集团分子及其他一切暗藏的反革命分子。这是纯洁高等学校队伍和提高教育质量的重要步骤。
    第三，要大力加强党的领导和学校政治思想工作，向一切麻痹大意和自由主义倾向作坚决的斗争；要建立和加强人事制度和保密制度，堵塞一切暗藏的反革命分子可以混入高等学校的漏洞。
