Eliminate Counter-Revolutionaries Completely
Xue Yu

For more than twenty years, Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng clique, just like the Trotsky and Bukharin double-dealers who were purged in the Soviet Union during socialist construction, have been wearing the cloak of Marxism and secretly engaging in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Historical facts tell us that the power of the people's revolution, under the leadership of the Party, is immensely powerful and invincible, and that all counter-revolutionaries and cliques will eventually escape the giant hand of the people and will inevitably suffer a shameful demise. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a powerful example.

Crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a class struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and it is a major political task for the people of the whole country, which no one can ignore. However, some people still have the mistaken idea that it "has nothing to do with me" and adopt a laissez-faire attitude of indifference. The root cause is that they do not fully understand the complexity and sharpness of the class struggle during the transition period, and therefore they are arrogant, complacent, and inattentive, burying themselves in economic construction and unwilling to get involved in politics. They forget that politics guides work, and only when the two are closely combined can we consolidate the people's democratic government and ensure the complete victory of socialist construction. Neglecting either aspect is wrong. If we "take care of our work and forget politics" and lose our vigilance, it will be easy for the enemy to take advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate our revolutionary ranks and carry out sabotage activities, which will bring undue damage to the cause of socialist construction. This is the reason why the members of the Hu Feng clique were able to lurk in the revolutionary ranks for a long time without being discovered by us. Is this not worthy of our drawing a lesson from?

There are also extremely individual comrades who not only are indifferent to this thrilling political struggle, but also adopt the extremely wrong attitude of "pouring cold water." They seem to have "doubts" about whether such a vicious and insidious clique is counter-revolutionary. They believe that the evidence in the three batches of materials is not enough to constitute a counter-revolutionary crime, as if it is best to seize a pistol or a transceiver to constitute a counter-revolutionary crime. These "well-meaning" people are really thinking too naively and simply. They seem to think that only killing people with guns and destroying our factories and institutions with explosives counts as counter-revolutionary. But the enemy is not as simple as they are. They understand that under the consolidation of the people's democratic government, they will adopt all kinds of double-dealing methods, legal, illegal, open, and hidden, to carry out conspiracies. They do not easily openly kill and set fires. They cunningly wear masks, infiltrate the ranks of the people, beat people with steel whips wrapped in rubber, and kill people with invisible knives, destroying the revolution and strangling the revolution from all sides. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is carrying out such counter-revolutionary activities under the banner of Marxism and wearing the cloak of progressive writers. The three batches of materials revealed by the "People's Daily" have irrefutably proved that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique not only hates a few revolutionary writers, nor only opposes the literary movement; what they hate is "this social order," what they hate is the Communist Party of China that leads the Chinese people's revolution, what they oppose is the people's revolutionary cause, they vainly hope that the people's democratic government will "utterly collapse," and all their actions and purposes are completely consistent with those of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Is this still worthy of "doubt"?

Those who adopt the above two kinds of wrong attitudes, or those who have similar attitudes, are precisely showing a serious tendency to deviate from political struggle and a lack of love for the people's democratic government. This is exactly what counter-revolutionaries welcome. We should wake up, actively plunge into this serious struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, firmly stand on the revolutionary position, and never have the slightest sympathy for counter-revolutionaries, just as Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "We will never exercise benevolence towards the reactionary acts of the reactionaries and the reactionary classes." Only in this way can we cleanse all the hidden counter-revolutionaries and ensure the complete victory of socialist construction.

We should learn a lesson from the Hu Feng clique incident. First of all, we must deeply realize that as our great motherland's socialist transformation and socialist construction develop, the class struggle is becoming more and more acute. Imperialism and its running dogs are unwilling to see our success and sit idly by and watch their own demise, and they will inevitably try every means to carry out sabotage. Cultural, educational, scientific, medical, and health undertakings are an inseparable part of our entire socialist construction, and the enemy will inevitably use all kinds of means to carry out sabotage in this area. The activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are an example. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant in the future, always pay attention to the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate liberalistic ideas and styles, so that the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of.

Secondly, the Hu Feng incident also fully illustrates the importance of ideological remolding of intellectuals. An intellectual who has not yet been well reformed is prone to bourgeois idealism and individualism, and those with these weaknesses are precisely the targets that the enemy wants to "win over." We must honestly and unremittingly study Marxism-Leninism, resolutely eliminate all remaining bourgeois ideas, and establish a communist world outlook. Chairman Mao taught us: "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." If we do not have the theoretical thought of Marxism-Leninism to guide us, we will not be able to see the world clearly, see the international situation and the future of the country clearly, distinguish between enemies and friends, and we will inevitably become a mediocre person who is busy all day long, politically numb, with dull senses, and increasingly short-sighted, and we will feel that international and domestic political issues have nothing to do with us. In this way, the enemy will take advantage of the opportunity and attack us, and we will easily be fooled by counter-revolutionaries. Marxism-Leninism is the pointer for our work. Only by mastering this universally applicable weapon can we improve our political and theoretical level, plug the loopholes in our thinking, learn the ability to distinguish counter-revolutionaries, and not give the enemy any chance to take advantage of. We must strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and carry out a resolute struggle to completely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries!

    把反革命分子消灭干净
    薛愚
    二十多年来，胡风和胡风集团分子，正像苏联在社会主义建设过程中所肃清的托洛茨基、布哈林两面派分子一样，一直披着马克思主义的外衣，暗中进行着反党、反人民、反革命的勾当。历史的事实告诉我们：人民革命的力量在党的领导下，是强大无比、战无不胜的，而一切反革命分子和集团终于逃不出人民的巨掌，必然会遭到可耻的灭亡。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，就是有力的例证。
    粉碎胡风反革命集团，是一个革命同反革命的阶级斗争，是全国人民当前的一个重大政治任务，任何人都不能忽视。可是，有些人还存在着“与我无关”的错误思想，而采取了漠不关心的自由主义的态度。其根本原因是：由于他们对于过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性认识不足，因而骄傲自满，麻痹大意，埋头经济建设，不愿过问政治。忘记了政治是指导业务的，只有二者密切的结合起来，才能巩固人民民主政权，保证社会主义建设彻底胜利。忽视任何一面都是错误的。如果我们“顾了业务，忘记政治”，丧失了警惕性，那就便利敌人乘隙钻入我们革命队伍中来进行破坏活动，而给社会主义建设事业带来不应有的损害。胡风集团分子所以能长期潜伏在革命队伍中而我们不能及早发觉，其原因就在于此。这难道还不值得我们引为教训吗？
    还有极其个别的同志对于这一场惊心动魄的政治斗争，不仅是漠不关心，而且采取了“泼冷水”的极端错误的态度。他们似乎对于这样一个凶恶、阴险的集团是否反革命还存有“怀疑”。认为三批材料的证据，还不能构成反革命罪证，好像是最好缴获一枝手枪，或一架收发报机，才能构成反革命犯罪的行为。这些“好心”的人，实在想得太天真和单纯了。他们好像认为只有用枪来杀害人民，用炸药来破坏我们的厂矿和机关，才算是反革命。可是敌人并不像他们那样简单，他们却懂得在人民民主政权巩固之下，采取合法的、非法的、公开的、隐蔽的等一切两面派手法进行阴谋活动。他们并不轻易地公开杀人放火。他们狡猾地戴上假面具，混进人民的队伍，打人用橡皮包的钢丝鞭子，杀人用不见血的刀子，从各方面来破坏革命，绞杀革命。胡风反革命集团，就是打着马克思主义的旗号，披着进步作家的外衣，进行着这样的反革命活动的。“人民日报”揭发的三批材料，铁证如山地证实了胡风反革命集团不仅是仇恨几个革命作家，也不仅是反对文艺运动；他们憎恨的是“这个社会秩序”，他们所仇视的是领导中国人民革命的中国共产党，他们所敌对的是人民革命事业，他们妄想人民民主政权
  “呜呼完蛋”，他们的一切作为和目的同美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的作为和目的完全一致的。这难道还值得“怀疑”吗？
    采取以上两种错误态度的人，或是有类似这种态度的人，正是严重的脱离政治斗争的倾向和不热爱人民民主政权的表现。这正是为反革命分子所欢迎的。我们应该清醒过来，积极地投身到这一革命同反革命的严重斗争中去，坚定革命立场，决不能对反革命分子有丝毫同情，正如毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中所说的，“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政”。只有这样，我们才能把一切暗藏的反革命分子清洗干净，保证社会主义建设彻底胜利。
      我们应该从胡风集团事件里吸取教训。首先，我们要深刻地认识到：随着我们伟大的祖国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展，阶级斗争愈来愈尖锐了。帝国主义及其走狗是不甘心于我们的成功而坐视自己的灭亡的，他们必然会千方百计地来进行破坏。文教科学、医药卫生事业是我们整个社会主义建设事业中的一个不可分割的组成部分，敌人必然也会从这方面用尽各种各样的手段来进行破坏。胡风反革命集团的活动就是一个实例。因此我们今后必须百倍地提高警惕，随时注意反革命分子的破坏活动，并肃清自由主义的思想和作风，使敌人无隙可乘。
    其次，胡风事件也充分地说明了知识分子思想改造的重要性。一个尚未改造好的知识分子，容易犯资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义的思想毛病，有这些弱点的人，正是敌人所要“争取”的对象。我们必须老老实实、坚持不懈地学习马克思列宁主义，坚决地肃清一切残余的资产阶级思想，建立共产主义的世界观。毛主席教导我们：“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”如果我们没有马克思列宁主义的理论思想来指导，我们就会看不清世界，看不清国际局势和国家前途，分不清敌友，必然会成为一个终日忙忙碌碌的庸人，在政治上麻痹大意，嗅觉不灵，目光越来越短小，就会觉得国际国内的政治问题都同自己无关。这样，敌人就会乘虚而入，向我们进攻，而我们也就容易上反革命分子的当。马克思列宁主义是我们工作的指针，只有掌握了这放之四海而皆准的武器，才能提高自己的政治理论水平，堵塞我们思想上的漏洞，学会辨别反革命分子的本领，不给敌人一点可能利用的机会。我们一定要加强对反革命分子的斗争，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子而进行坚决的斗争！
