　　Disregard for Public Opinion Leads to Waste
    To the Editor:
    The leadership of the Liaoning Provincial State-Owned Yantai Coal Mine has caused significant waste in the pithead construction project due to their failure to listen to the opinions of the masses.

    The Yantai Coal Mine decided to build the Beixin Pit in 1953. However, due to insufficient consideration beforehand, work had to be suspended midway. In March 1954, the mine continued to build the Beixin Pit to replace the ventilation shaft of the Dong'er Pit. Later, they blindly decided to expand the tunnel and convert it into a transportation tunnel. At that time, the pit manager, Mu Riqing, suggested that the coal seam in this pit was sparse and the reserves had not been clarified. He argued that converting it into a transportation tunnel would not only be unsuitable but would also prevent the extraction of the nearby safety coal pillars, resulting in waste. This correct opinion did not receive the attention it deserved. As a result, after the transportation tunnel was built, only over 28,000 tons of coal were extracted, wasting more than 50,000 yuan of investment. Moreover, 15,000 tons of coal were lost and could not be extracted.

    In 1953, the central small haulage of the West Seventh Pit encountered water and could not be mined temporarily. The mine decided to mine a temporary small haulage. In reality, the temporary small haulage was shallower than the central small haulage and could not replace it at all. The Party branch secretary of the pit raised this issue with the mine, but the mine manager and engineer insisted on proceeding with the construction. As a result, after more than three months of construction and over 500 meters of tunneling, it was discovered during acceptance inspection that it was useless. In 1954, the mine decided to replace the Right Eleventh Gully with the Huimagou. Deputy pit manager Liu Guoliang raised a different opinion, but the leadership refused to accept it. As a result, after tunneling over 300 meters, it was discovered that it was useless. These two items alone wasted more than 130,000 yuan of state property.

    In addition, some waste was also caused in the construction process of the East Seventh Pit due to the leadership's failure to listen to the opinions of the masses.

    The Yantai Coal Mine leadership wrongly believed that all technical problems could only be decided by a few senior technical personnel, and that the opinions of personnel performing specific tasks were not worth considering. After causing waste, they always claimed that "there are many objective difficulties, and waste is inevitable." Because they do not face up to their mistakes and do not learn from them, wasteful events continue to occur.

    We believe that the Yantai Coal Mine leadership should examine their mistakes of being divorced from the masses ideologically, establish the idea of relying on the masses to do a good job, and only in this way can they effectively overcome the phenomenon of waste.

### 不听取群众意见造成了浪费

　　不听取群众意见造成了浪费编辑同志：
    辽宁省地方国营烟台煤矿领导人员在坑口建设工程中不听取群众意见，造成了很大的浪费。
    烟台煤矿在一九五三年就决定新建北新坑。但是由于事先考虑不周，不得不中途停工。一九五四年三月，矿里继续修建北新坑来代替东二坑的通风道，后来却又盲目决定扩大坑道，改为运输道。当时坑长穆日清提出：这个坑煤层稀少，埋藏量没弄清，如果改为运输道，不但不适宜，而且会使附近的安全煤柱不能取出，造成浪费。这个正确的意见并没有得到应有的重视。结果运输道建成后，只取了二万八千多吨煤就完了，白白浪费了五万多元的投资；而且还丢了一万五千吨煤无法取出。
    一九五三年，西七坑中央小卷遇水，暂时不能掘进，矿方决定开采临时小卷。实际上，临时小卷比中央小卷浅，根本不能代替中央小卷。坑的党支部书记就把这个情况向矿上提出，矿长和工程师仍然坚持施工。结果，施工三个多月，掘进五百多公尺，在验收时才发现没有用。一九五四年，矿方又决定把回马沟代替右十一沟。副坑长刘国良提出不同的意见，领导方面拒不接受，结果掘进了三百多公尺，才发现没有用处。这两项，就浪费了国家财产十三万多元。
    此外在东七坑的建设过程中，由于领导人员不听取群众意见，也造成了一些浪费。
    烟台煤矿领导人员错误地认为所有技术问题只能由几个高级技术人员来决定，做具体工作的人员的意见是不值得重视的。他们在造成浪费以后，总是认为“客观困难多，难免浪费”。由于他们不正视自己的错误，不从中吸取教训，浪费事件也就不断发生。
    我们认为，烟台煤矿的领导人员应该从思想上检查脱离群众的错误，树立依靠群众搞好工作的思想，只有这样，才能有效地克服浪费现象。
