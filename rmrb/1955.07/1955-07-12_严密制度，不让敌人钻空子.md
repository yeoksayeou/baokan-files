Strict Systems, Leaving No Gaps for Enemies to Exploit
Zhong Huai

The fact that Hu Feng elements infiltrated state organs, even infiltrating the Communist Party, stealing Party and state secrets and engaging in other counter-revolutionary activities, shows that the personnel systems and procedures for accepting Party members in many of our state organs and Party organizations are not strict enough, thus leaving loopholes for counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements to exploit. In fact, there are far more than just Hu Feng elements; there are even more other counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements who have exploited and continue to exploit the loopholes in our lax systems to carry out their criminal activities.

The case of the swindler Ai Xiuzhen, who pretended to be a Communist Party member and infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, which was exposed in Jiangxi Province not long ago, is one of many such facts. Ai Xiuzhen was a female rogue and swindler who consistently stole and extorted other people's property. By chance, she picked up a piece of paper that had not been torn up from the wastepaper basket of the secretary section of the Jiujiang Water Public Security Bureau, which had the seal of the "Chinese Communist Party Jiujiang Special District Public Security Office Branch" on it. She then used this piece of paper, after altering it, as her "Party member introduction letter," pretending to be an official member of the Chinese Communist Party. She successively carried out deceptive activities in many units such as the CCP Nanchang County Sixth District Committee, Fifth District Committee, Sanjiang Town Branch, Nanchang County Committee, Nanchang Prefectural Committee, Nanchang Municipal Committee, Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Organization Department, and Fengxin County Committee, and was finally assigned to work in the Communist Youth League Fengxin County Committee. The reason why Ai Xiuzhen was able to deceive so many Party organizations was not only because the relevant staff in these Party organizations suffered from severe political paralysis, but also because the systems in these units were not strict and had many loopholes. For example, the so-called Party member introduction letter that Ai Xiuzhen initially stole from the Jiujiang Water Public Security Bureau and the so-called administrative introduction letter she later stole from the Nanchang Municipal Committee were both pieces of paper with official seals that were picked up from the wastepaper basket without being destroyed. Why could such "pieces of paper" be casually thrown into the wastepaper basket without being destroyed? Since what Ai Xiuzhen took was a piece of paper with the seal of the Jiujiang Special District Public Security Office Branch, and the paper did not specify the unit being introduced, how could the relevant personnel of the Nanchang County Fifth District Committee regard it as a formal Party member introduction letter? Is this permissible under the Party's organizational procedures? When Ai Xiuzhen went to the Fengxin County Committee Organization Department to request "job assignment," she brought a Party member introduction letter from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Organization Department and an administrative introduction letter from the Nanchang Municipal Committee, which was a complete mismatch, and there was no personnel material at all. However, the Fengxin County Committee Organization Department quickly assigned her a job without any review. This shows how lax the personnel system in this unit had become! Since these people were so careless and the systems in these organs were full of loopholes, is it any wonder that the swindler Ai Xiuzhen was able to swagger in and out of many units!

The counter-revolutionary case of the "China Advanced Revolutionary Committee Anti-Communist and Anti-Soviet National Salvation General Association" cracked in the Jinan Special District of Shanxi is another example. The backbone elements of this counter-revolutionary organization were all loyal lackeys of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs before liberation. After liberation, they took advantage of our weakness in not strictly reviewing the recruitment of staff and infiltrated state organs and enterprise departments such as the People's Bank of Jinan District, the Grain Bureau, and state-owned farms. After they infiltrated, wearing the guise of state workers, they took advantage of our lax systems and procedures to carry out counter-revolutionary activities wantonly. For example, the bandit leader Zhao Zichang and others, who were lurking in the former Linfen Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, not only stole the organ's documents and seals to cover up their own and other counter-revolutionary elements' sabotage activities, but also stole passbooks and forged deposit slips, embezzling large amounts of state funds. At the same time, they also stole the public's inkpads, ink, and numbering machines to be used as funds and tools for their counter-revolutionary activities.

Don't think that the examples mentioned above are just isolated phenomena. Aren't unsound and lax personnel systems, security systems, fire prevention and anti-theft systems, production management systems, work systems, and even procedures for accepting Party members quite common? Some comrades believe that strict systems are a kind of constraint on themselves. This view is wrong. Strict systems are not a constraint on us, but only a real constraint on counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements. Therefore, they try their best to sabotage these systems or exploit the loopholes in our lax systems to infiltrate our revolutionary organizations and carry out sabotage activities. Some comrades also think that following strict systems is too "troublesome." But if we are casual, careless, and do not follow the systems, and as a result, counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements exploit the loopholes, wouldn't that be even more troublesome? In studying the Hu Feng incident, we all said that we must raise our vigilance. Raising vigilance is not just empty talk, it should be manifested in practical actions. One of the practical measures we should take is to resolutely plug the loopholes in lax systems and not leave the slightest gap for counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements!

    严密制度，不让敌人钻空子
    锺怀
    胡风分子混进了国家机关，甚至打入共产党内，盗窃党和国家的机密并进行其他反革命活动。这个事实说明了我们不少国家机关和党组织的人事制度和接受党员的手续很不严格，因而给反革命分子和其他坏分子留下了可钻的空隙。事实上，绝不止是胡风分子，还有更多别的反革命分子和坏分子，曾经钻了而且还在继续钻我们制度不严的空子，进行他们的罪恶活动。
    不久以前江西省揭露的骗子艾秀珍冒充共产党员，混进革命队伍的事情，是许多这样的事实中的一件。艾秀珍是个一贯盗窃、讹诈别人财物的女流氓和骗子。她因一个偶然的机会在九江水上公安局秘书股的字纸篓里拾到一张没有撕破的、上面盖了
  “中国共产党九江专署公安处支部”章子的便条，便利用这张便条加以涂改作为自己的“党员介绍信”，冒充起中共正式党员，先后在中共南昌县六区区委、五区区委、三江镇支部、南昌县委、南昌地委、南昌市委、江西省委组织部、奉新县委等许多单位进行欺骗活动，最后并被分配到青年团奉新县委会工作。艾秀珍之所以能够蒙混过许多党组织，除了因为这些党组织的有关工作人员患了严重的政治麻痹症外，还因为这些单位的制度不严，漏洞很多。举例来说，艾秀珍最初从九江水上公安局盗窃来的所谓党员介绍信和以后在南昌市委盗窃来的所谓行政介绍信，都是从字纸篓里拾到的盖有公章、未经撕毁的便条。为什么像这样的“便条”可以随随便便扔在字纸篓里而不加销毁呢？艾秀珍拿的既然是一张盖有九江专署公安处支部公章的便条，而且便条上并未写明被介绍的单位，南昌县五区区委的有关人员就把它看作正式的党员介绍信，这难道是党的组织手续所能允许的吗？当艾秀珍到奉新县委组织部要求“分配工作”时，带的是江西省委组织部的党员介绍信和南昌市委的行政介绍信，这真是“牛头不对马嘴”，同时又没有一点人事材料；可是奉新县委组织部竟不加任何审查就很快地分配她的工作。这又说明这个单位的人事制度已经松弛到了怎样的程度！既然这些人马马虎虎，这些机关的制度漏洞百出，骗子艾秀珍能够大摇大摆地出入于许多单位，这又有什么奇怪呢！
    山西晋南专区破获的“中国先进革命委员会反共抗苏救国总会”反革命案件，是另外一个例子。这个反革命组织的骨干分子解放前都是蒋阎匪帮的忠实走狗，解放后却利用我们吸收工作人员审查不严的弱点，钻进了晋南地区的人民银行、粮食局、国营农场等国家机关和企业部门。他们在钻了进来，披上了国家工作人员的外衣之后，又利用我们制度松弛、手续不严的弱点，放肆地进行反革命活动。例如潜藏在中国人民银行前临汾中心支行的匪首赵梓昌等，就不仅窃取了机关的证件、印章，来掩护他们自己和其他反革命分子进行破坏活动，而且窃取存摺、伪造存单，大量盗窃国家资财。同时还窃取公家的印台、油墨、号码机等，充作他们反革命活动的经费和工具。
    不要以为像上面所说的例子，只是个别的现象。人事制度、保密制度、防火防盗制度、生产管理制度、工作制度乃至接收党员的手续等等不健全不严密，难道不是相当普遍的现象吗？有的同志认为严密的制度对于自己是一种约束。这种看法是错误的。严密的制度对于我们并不是约束，只是对于反革命分子和坏分子才是真正的约束，因此他们千方百计地来破坏这些制度或利用我们制度不严的空子，钻进我们的革命组织，进行破坏活动。也有的同志认为按照严密的制度办事太“麻烦”。但是如果我们随随便便，马马虎虎，不按制度办事，结果让反革命分子和坏分子钻了空子，那岂不是更大的麻烦？在学习胡风事件中，我们都说要提高警惕。提高警惕不是一句空话，它应当表现为实际行动。我们所应当采取的实际措施之一，就是坚决堵塞制度不严的漏洞，不给反革命分子和坏分子留下丝毫的空隙！
