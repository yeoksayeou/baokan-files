The State Council recently approved the Sports Commission's report on "Summary of National Sports Work in 1954 and Work Tasks for 1955."

The report stated that under the attention and leadership of the Party and the state, and with the development of national economic construction and the increasing improvement of the people's material and cultural lives, mass sports activities in China developed greatly in 1954. In 30 cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the proportion of workers in factories and mines who regularly participate in radio exercises, ball games, martial arts, and other sports activities has reached 15% of the total number of workers. In cities above the level of provincial capitals, schools promoting the Labor and Defense System (preparatory level) account for 50% of the total number of schools. On average, more than 70% of government employees nationwide participate in workplace exercises. In the military, comprehensive sports meets, individual sports competitions, and league round-robin matches are held regularly; the trial implementation of the Labor and Defense System has also yielded good results.

In terms of national defense sports, gliding and parachute jumping, motorcycle riding, shooting, radio, rowing, sailing, and military camping activities were also held in Beijing, Qingdao, Chengdu, and Chongqing in 1954.

The development of mass sports activities has shown good results in improving people's health, strengthening their physique, and increasing production, work, and study efficiency. Many factory and mine workers reflected that "sports activities have made us all feel younger."

In 1954, various sports competitions were held throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 202 comprehensive sports meets were held at the provincial and municipal levels nationwide, with the participation of more than 239,000 athletes. Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun regularly held triangular league matches.

In 1954, 54 new national records were set in track and field, swimming, ice sports, and cycling. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the highest records for men's and women's track and field events were only changed seven times in the eighteen years from 1930 to 1948; however, in the two years of 1953 and 1954 in New China, they were changed 72 times. In August 1954, at the 12th World Student Games held in Budapest, the scores of Chinese athletes were also higher than in the previous Games.

In order to learn from each other and exchange experiences, China and the Soviet Union, as well as other fraternal countries, also exchanged sports delegations and sports teams in 1954. China has also joined twelve international sports organizations. The People's Sports Publishing House published 61 kinds of sports books last year; the circulation of the "New Sports" magazine has reached 100,170 copies.

The report also pointed out that the shortcomings in sports work in 1954 were: insufficient implementation of the Party's policies and instructions on developing sports activities, so that some erroneous understandings and vague views on sports activities have not been thoroughly clarified among the masses and many cadres; mass sports activities have been widely developed, but there is insufficient planned leadership and technical guidance; insufficient study of the Soviet Union and insufficient research into professional skills; and sports commissions at all levels in various regions are very incomplete in their organizations, and the quantity and quality of cadres are weak.

The report said that in order to further develop sports activities, the Sports Commission has determined that sports activities in 1955 should continue to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the principle of "combining with actual conditions, developing mass sports activities, and gradually popularizing and regularizing them" on the basis of 1954, according to the overall tasks of the country, so as to "ensure that mass sports activities are effectively carried out first in factories, mines, schools, troops, and government offices." To make sports a cause for all the people, and more effectively serve production and national defense. The specific tasks are: (1) According to the requirements of the masses and the experience of the Soviet Union, establish sports associations. The focus is on various industrial systems, with the trade union as the main body and the Sports Commission assisting. Some industrial systems can first establish central sports associations, and then gradually establish local and grassroots organizations. Some larger factories and mines with a considerable foundation in sports activities can also first establish grassroots sports associations, from the bottom up, to cooperate with each other. Universities and colleges should only select key points to try to build grassroots sports associations. (2) Continue to promote the Labor and Defense System, so that it gradually becomes the foundation of China's sports system. Continue to promote the Labor and Defense System (preparatory level) in secondary schools and above throughout the country, and gradually promote the Labor and Defense System, requiring a development of one to one and a half times on the original basis, and conduct tests in a planned and organized manner in stages and seasons. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must implement the Labor and Defense System throughout the army in accordance with the national unified regulations, items and standards. In developing mass sports activities, actively carry out national defense sports activities. In major cities, select different key points to carry out activities such as aviation modeling, shooting, gliding, parachute jumping, rowing, sailing, and motorcycles. These activities will gradually form a widespread mass movement. (3) Better organize competition activities, and develop mass sports activities through competition activities. Learn from the Soviet experience and gradually develop a set of competition systems. Minimize large sports meets with long durations, many events, and formalism, and hold more small or single-item competitions.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the Sports Commission is also preparing to train cadres in large numbers in a planned way according to the development of work in various regions; strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government over sports activities, strengthen the organizations of sports commissions at all levels in various regions, and improve work methods and work style.

    体育运动委员会
    总结去年全国体育工作确定今年工作任务
    最近国务院批准了体育运动委员会关于“一九五四年全国体育工作的总结和一九五五年的工作任务”的报告。
    这个报告说明：在党和国家的重视和领导下，随着国家经济建设的发展，以及人民物质、文化生活的日益改善，一九五四年，我国群众性的体育运动有很大的开展。在北京、天津、上海等三十个城市中，厂矿里的职工经常参加广播操、球类、武术和其他体育活动的，已占总人数的百分之十五。省辖市以上的城市，推行劳卫制预备级的学校占学校总数的百分之五十。全国参加工间操的机关干部，平均占机关总人数的百分之七十以上。在部队中，经常举行综合性的运动会、单项运动竞赛和连队循环比赛；试行劳卫制也得到良好的效果。
    在国防体育方面，一九五四年在北京、青岛、成都和重庆等城市还分别举行过滑翔跳伞、摩托车、射击、无线电、划船、航海和军事露营等活动。
    群众性体育活动的开展，对增进人民的健康和增强人民的体质，以及提高生产、工作、学习效率等方面，都显示了良好的作用。许多厂矿的职工反映说：“开展了体育活动，都变得年轻了”。
    一九五四年，各地举行了多种多样的运动竞赛。据不完全统计，全国省市以上举行的综合运动会共二百零二次，参加的运动员有二十三万九千多人。鞍山、本溪、抚顺三市经常举行三角联赛。
    一九五四年，在田径、游泳、冰上、自行车运动中，出现了五十四项新的全国最高纪录。在国民党反动统治时期，一九三零到一九四八的十八年中，男、女田径项目的最高纪录只改变了七次；而在新中国一九五三、一九五四两年内，就改变了七十二次。一九五四年八月，在布达佩斯举行的第十二届世界学生运动会上，我国运动员得分也比上届多。
    为了互相学习和交流经验，一九五四年我国和苏联以及其他兄弟国家，还互派了体育代表团和运动队。我国并已参加了十二个国际体育组织。人民体育出版社去年已出版了六十一种体育书籍；“新体育”杂志的发行量已达到十万零一千七百份。
    报告中还指出：一九五四年体育工作中存在的缺点是：贯彻党对开展体育运动的方针、指示不够，以致在群众和不少干部中，对体育运动的某些错误认识和模糊观点还没有彻底澄清；群众性体育运动曾有广泛开展，但有计划地领导和技术指导不够；学习苏联、钻研业务不够；各地各级体育运动委员会机构很不健全，干部量少质弱。
    报告说，为了进一步开展体育运动，体育运动委员会确定一九五五年的体育运动应根据国家的总任务，在一九五四年的基础上，继续贯彻党中央的指示和“结合实际情况，开展群众性的体育运动，并逐步使之普及和经常化”的方针，“使群众性的体育运动首先在厂矿、学校、部队和机关中切实地开展起来”。使体育运动成为全民的事业，更有效地为生产和国防服务。具体的任务是：（一）根据群众的要求和苏联的经验，建立体育协会。重点放在各产业系统，以工会为主，体委协助。有些产业系统可以先成立中央的体育协会，然后逐步建立地方的和基层的组织。有些体育活动有相当基础的较大厂矿也可以先建立基层的体育协会，由下而上，互相配合。高等学校只选择重点，试建基层的体育协会。（二）继续推行劳卫制，使它逐步成为我国的体育制度的基础。继续在全国中等以上学校推行劳卫制预备级和逐步推广劳卫制，要求在原有的基础上发展一倍到一倍半，并有计划有组织地按季节分期进行测验。中国人民解放军要根据国家统一规定的项目和标准，在全军推行劳卫制。在开展群众性体育工作中，积极开展国防体育活动。在各大城市，选择不同的重点，开展航空模型、射击、滑翔、跳伞、划船、航海、摩托车等项活动。使这些活动逐步形成广泛的群众性的运动。（三）更好地组织竞赛活动，并通过竞赛活动开展群众性的体育运动。要学习苏联经验，逐步订出一套竞赛制度来。尽量少开时间长、项目多、形式主义的大运动会，多举行小型的或单项的竞赛。
    为保证上述任务的完成，体育运动委员会还准备根据各地工作发展的情况，有计划地大批地培养和训练干部；加强党和政府对体育运动的领导，充实各地各级体委机构，改进工作方法和工作作风。
