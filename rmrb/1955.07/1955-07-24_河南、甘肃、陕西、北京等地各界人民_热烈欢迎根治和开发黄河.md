People from all walks of life in Henan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Beijing and other places, with boundless excitement, welcomed Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Calamities and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy," and expressed their determination to vigorously support the successful realization of this great plan.

Ren Zhiming, Vice Chairman of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference of Henan Province, said: Before liberation, the people of Henan suffered from the four major disasters of water, drought, locusts, and Tang (referring to the Chiang bandit army of Tang Enbo, which entrenched itself in Henan during the Anti-Japanese War). Now that the state is going to eliminate the Yellow River's water calamities, this is truly a great joy for the more than 40 million people of Henan Province. Our people from all walks of life in Henan must vigorously support the construction of the project to fundamentally solve the Yellow River problem. The people in the Yellow River flooded area more enthusiastically support the grand plan for radically solving and developing the Yellow River. Seventeen years ago, the Chiang bandits breached the Huayuankou levee, and the Yellow River flowed south. The people of Zhongmu County were the first to bear the brunt. Now, after hearing the news that the state is going to fundamentally solve and develop the Yellow River, the people of Zhongmu County feel extremely excited. Zhang Shulin, a member of the Communist Youth League in Mengzhuang Township, said, "Whenever people are needed, I will be there! I will definitely take the lead in participating in the Yellow River control." Meng Zhaolan, a young woman, said: "We women also have a part in controlling the Yellow River. We will start a competition with the men."

The staff of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission were particularly excited. Zhou Hongshi, a member of the survey team who traveled thousands of miles in 1952 to survey the source of the Yellow River, said: "At that time, we hoped that the day of fundamentally solving and developing the Yellow River would come sooner. Now that day is not far away. We surveyors must do everything in our power to strive for the complete realization of the Yellow River plan!" The entire staff of the Comprehensive Survey Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River, which is conducting investigations and research on the Loess Plateau in western Shanxi Province, wrote to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on the 20th, saying: "In addition to successfully completing the task of surveying soil and water conservation in an area of more than 20,000 square kilometers in western Shanxi Province, we are also willing to contribute all our strength to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the state at any time."

The entire staff of the Forestry Bureau of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Gansu Province held a discussion. Forestry Engineer Yuan Shuzhi said: "In the future, I will work hard to do a good job in afforestation in soil and water conservation, so that I can play the role of a cog in the great plan to fundamentally solve and develop the Yellow River." The peasants of Zhang Panma Village in Lijin County, Shandong Province, in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, were very excited and expressed their willingness to support the state in realizing the plan to control the Yellow River as soon as possible, and to ensure that people are provided when needed, and money is contributed when needed. An elderly farmer, Zhang Linxue, said: "Since the old generation, people have dreamed of when the Yellow River would be controlled. Now it is really going to be controlled. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would not be possible in ten thousand years."

The responsible persons of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee and relevant agencies unanimously expressed their firm implementation of the great plan to fundamentally solve the Yellow River problem. Shi Yizhi, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, said: "The people of our Shaanxi Province should actively support and support this plan, and bravely shoulder the responsibilities that the people's committees at all levels in the province and the people of the province should bear, so as to promote the early realization of this plan." Xie Huaide, Director of the Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Office of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee and Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Li Zijian, Director of the Provincial Department of Forestry, Guan Jianxun, Director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and Ma Huating, Director of the Provincial Animal Husbandry Bureau, also expressed their determination to lead agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry workers throughout the province and farmers throughout the province to ensure the realization of this great historical task.

Workers in Shanxi Province engaged in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation have expressed their determination to do a good job in soil and water conservation for the management of the Yellow River. Cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau are revising the province's five-year plan for water conservancy in accordance with the general task of managing and developing the Yellow River, and are preparing in advance for the planning of the basins of the Sushui River, Qinhe River, and other tributaries of the Yellow River. All cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Soil and Water Conservation Bureau expressed their intention to step up their work in the second half of the year and strive to exceed the target of controlling 1 million mu of farmland, gullies, and other areas in 22 key counties along the Yellow River and its tributaries, and to mobilize the people of the province to manage and maintain the existing soil and water conservation projects.

Water conservancy workers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region expressed their determination to contribute all their strength to the realization of this grand plan. Wang Tingzhang, a water conservancy engineer who has been engaged in Yellow River management for nearly ten years, and He Liang, a water conservancy engineer who used to work in the Beiluo River, believe that the realization of this plan will bring unlimited benefits to the people.

The broad masses of people in Beijing regard the plan for fundamentally solving and developing the Yellow River as a plan to benefit future generations. The employees of the Hydraulic Machinery Repair Plant of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, who are manufacturing drilling equipment for the Yellow River project, are in an unprecedented state of high morale in production. Zuo Jingwen and other workers in the machine shop expressed their intention to make drilling equipment in a timely manner and send it to the construction site for fundamentally solving and developing the Yellow River as soon as possible.

    热烈欢迎根治和开发黄河
    本报讯　河南、甘肃、陕西、山西、内蒙古自治区、北京等地各界人民，以无限兴奋的心情欢迎国务院副总理邓子恢“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，并表示要大力支持这个伟大计划胜利实现。
    中国人民政治协商会议河南省第一届委员会副主席任芝铭说：解放前，河南人民苦于水、旱、蝗、汤（指抗日时期盘踞河南的蒋贼军汤恩伯部）四大灾害。现在国家要根除黄河水害，这对河南全省四千多万人民来说真是大喜事。我们河南各界人民一定要大力支持根治黄河工程的建设。黄泛区人民更为热烈地拥护根治和开发黄河的宏伟计划。十七年前蒋匪扒开花园口大堤，黄河南流，中牟县人民首当其冲。现在中牟县人民听到国家要根治和开发黄河的消息后，感到无比兴奋。孟庄乡青年团员张树林说，啥时要人啥时到，我一定带头参加治黄河。青年妇女孟照兰说：治黄河我们妇女也有一份，我们要和男子挑起竞赛。
    黄河水利委员会的工作人员特别感到兴奋。曾在一九五二年远涉几千里查勘黄河河源的查勘队队员周鸿石说：那时我们就盼望根治和开发黄河的日子早些到来。现在这个日子不远了。我们查勘工作者，今后要尽一切力量为黄河规划的彻底实现而奋斗！正在山西省西部黄土高原上进行调查研究的黄河中游水土保持综合考察队全体工作人员，二十日写信给第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议说：我们除了要胜利完成山西省西部二万多平方公里面积内的水土保持考查任务外，还愿意贡献自己的一切力量，完成国家随时交给的光荣任务。
    甘肃省农林厅林业局的全体工作人员召开了座谈会。林业工程师袁述之说：“我今后要努力作好水土保持中的植树造林工作，使自己在实现根治和开发黄河的伟大计划中起一个螺丝钉的作用。”黄河下游山东省利津县张潘马村农民都非常兴奋，纷纷表示要支援国家早日实现治理黄河的计划，保证作到要人有人，要钱出钱。老年农民张林学说：从老辈里，人们就梦想啥时候把黄河治好。现在真要开始治理黄河了，要不是共产党的领导，一万年也是办不到的。
    陕西省人民委员会和有关机关的负责人，一致表示坚决贯彻执行根治黄河的伟大计划。陕西省副省长时逸之说：我们陕西省人民应该积极拥护和支持，并要把地方各级人民委员会和全省人民应该担负的责任勇敢地担负起来，促使这个计划早日实现。陕西省人民委员会农林水利办公室主任、省农业厅厅长谢怀德、省林业厅厅长李子健、省水利局局长管建勋、省农业厅畜牧局局长马华亭也都表示要领导全省农业、林业、水利、畜牧工作者和全省农民，保证这一伟大历史任务的实现。
    山西省从事农业、林业、水利和水土保持工作的工作者们，纷纷表示决心为治理黄河而做好水土保持工作。山西省水利局的干部正根据治理和开发黄河的总任务着手重新修订山西省水利工作的五年计划，并要提前做好涑水河、沁河等黄河支流流域的规划工作。山西省水土保持局全体干部表示要在下半年加紧工作，并在沿黄河及其支流的二十二个重点县争取超额完成控制田面、沟壑等面积一百万亩，发动全省人民管理护养现有各项水土保持工程。
    内蒙古自治区的水利工作者表示要为这个雄伟计划的实现贡献出全部力量。曾从事治黄工作近十年的水利工程师王廷璋和过去在北洛河工作的水利工程师何量，认为实现这个计划后，将给人民带来无限的福利。
    北京市广大人民都把根治和开发黄河的计划，看作是为子孙万代造福的计划。正在为黄河工程制造钻探器材的水利部工程总局水工机械修配厂的职工们，生产情绪空前高涨。机工车间工人左敬文等表示要及时作好钻探器材，早日送到根治和开发黄河的工地去。
