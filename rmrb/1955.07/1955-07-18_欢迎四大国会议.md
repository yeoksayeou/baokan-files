　　Welcome Four-Power Conference

　　The whole world is now watching Geneva. There, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France begin their meeting today.

　　The holding of the Four-Power Summit is an international event of great historical significance. It is the first top-level meeting of major powers since the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The resumption of consultations between the heads of major powers after a ten-year hiatus reflects the significant changes in international political life over the past decade. It marks the failure of the policy of strength pursued by some countries and the victory of the policy of peaceful consultation pursued by peace-loving countries.

　　The people of the world are against war and demand peace. The Four-Power Summit should be a good start to ending the "Cold War," restoring mutual trust between countries, and further easing international tensions. To this end, the Soviet government delegation attending the conference stated on July 15 that the Soviet delegation was going to Geneva "to frankly discuss extremely important international issues with other major powers, to find common ground, and to work together to ease international tensions and strengthen trust in relations between countries." We believe that this is the attitude that all delegations participating in the conference should maintain.

　　Obviously, the conference will have to discuss issues of close concern to the whole world, such as disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, European collective security, the German question, and the situation in the Far East. All these issues are closely related to consolidating peace and easing international tensions. The resolution of the disarmament issue will greatly eliminate the threat of a new war and free the people of all countries from the heavy burden of armaments. In this regard, the Soviet government's proposal of May 10, 1955, on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war, has opened up broad avenues for resolving this issue, and has therefore received widespread attention and welcome from world opinion. On the 16th of this month, Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, solemnly declared at the Second Session of the National People's Congress: The Chinese people warmly support this proposal of the Soviet government. At the same time, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai also stated: "We also fully support the Soviet government's proposal to convene a world conference on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, with the participation of member states and non-member states of the United Nations, no later than the first half of 1956." People now have every right to expect the Western countries to make a peace-friendly response to the Soviet proposals at the Geneva conference.

　　The issue of establishing a European collective security system in which all European countries can participate and the resolution of the German question are not only major keys to ensuring European peace, but are also closely related to world peace. A rearmed West Germany being drawn into the North Atlantic bloc is incompatible with the establishment of European collective security. That can only deepen the division of Europe and Germany, make the European situation more tense, and increase the threat of war. The Soviet Union firmly advocates the establishment of a European collective security system, and advocates the restoration of German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Soviet Union's position is in the interests of the German people and the interests of the European people. The Western countries have no tenable reason to disagree with the Soviet Union's position.

　　The Four-Power Conference must discuss the situation in the Far East. This is of particular significance to the Chinese people and the Asian people. The United States has repeatedly expressed its unwillingness to discuss this issue, which is entirely based on the desire to create tension and prepare for war, rather than the desire to ease the situation. This attitude must be opposed by the world's fair-minded public opinion.

　　It cannot be denied that the tasks facing the Four-Power Conference are complex and arduous, and some people with ulterior motives are still trying to belittle the conference, saying that it is seemingly insignificant. Some people are spreading rumors in an attempt to widen the mistrust between the participating countries. They even spread pessimistic air, thinking that the meeting cannot achieve success. These people want to control the world according to their own evil ideas. But the people of the world have their own firm understanding. The key to whether the conference can achieve success lies in whether the participating countries have the sincerity to solve the problems. History proves that the summit of the great powers can promote the development of the situation. Several summits of the great powers during World War II decided the course of the war and guaranteed the great victory of the anti-fascist war. In the post-war period, the 1954 Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Berlin Conference opened the way for the restoration of great power consultation, leading to the convening of the Geneva Conference with the participation of the five major foreign ministers, and at the Geneva Conference, the issue of restoring peace in Indochina was finally resolved.

　　As pointed out in the statement issued by the Soviet delegation attending the conference on July 15, "If all participants in the conference can show sincerity and sincerely commit themselves to reaching an agreement, there is no doubt that we will find common ground and develop practical ways to effectively solve extremely important issues related to peace and the happiness of the people of all countries." Based on its peaceful foreign policy, the Soviet Union has indicated that it will make great efforts to achieve these lofty goals. U.S. President Eisenhower also recently stated that although he "does not have too many expectations" for the conference, he believes that "if some ways can be found to relieve people of the burden of fear and tension, we should explore these ways to the maximum extent." He also said that "peaceful rather than provocative methods" should be adopted, and that the slogan of the "Cold War" should be abandoned. If Eisenhower really turns these words into concrete actions at the Four-Power Conference, then there is a good prospect for world peace.

　　With ardent aspirations for peace and strong hatred for war, world public opinion unanimously demands that the Four-Power Conference make due contributions to promoting mutual trust between countries and consolidating peace. The Soviet Union has made many efforts, and the United States, Britain, and France should live up to the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world and make the conference a start to ending the "Cold War" and further easing international tensions.

　　The Chinese people fully understand the important responsibility they bear in the cause of maintaining peace. We have made and are still making unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, eliminate the threat of war, and ensure world peace. The Chinese people warmly welcome the convening of the Four-Power Summit and will join with peace-loving people all over the world to work to promote the success of the conference in resolving major international issues.

### 欢迎四大国会议

    欢迎四大国会议
    全世界现在都注视着日内瓦。在那里，今天开始了苏、美、英、法四国政府的首脑会议。
    四大国首脑会议的举行是具有重大历史意义的国际事件。它是从一九四五年波茨坦会议以来的第一次大国最高级会议。中断了十年之久的大国首脑之间的协商的恢复，反映着十年中国际政治生活的重大变化。它标志着某些国家所奉行的实力政策正在走向失败，爱好和平国家所奉行的和平协商政策正在走向胜利。
    世界人民反对战争，要求和平。四大国首脑会议应当成为结束“冷战”、恢复各国间的相互信任、进一步缓和国际局势的良好开端。为此，参加这个会议的苏联政府代表团在七月十五日声明：苏联代表团去日内瓦，“是为了要开诚布公地同其他大国商讨极其重要的国际问题，寻找共同的基础，共同努力求得缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国关系中的信任。”我们认为，这是所有参加这个会议的各国代表团都应当保持的态度。
    显然，会议将不能不讨论全世界所密切关心的这样的问题，如像裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题、欧洲集体安全问题、德国问题以及远东的局势问题。所有这些问题都同巩固和平、缓和国际紧张局势有着十分密切的关系。裁减军备问题的解决将大大消除新战争的威胁，并使各国人民摆脱军备的沉重负担。在这方面，苏联政府在一九五五年五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议，已经为解决这个问题开辟了广阔的途径，因而受到了世界舆论的广泛重视和欢迎。本月十六日，中华人民共和国彭德怀副总理兼国防部长在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上庄严声明：中国人民热烈支持苏联政府的这一建议。同时彭德怀副总理还表示：“我们也完全支持苏联政府提出的最迟在一九五六年上半年召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器会议的建议。”人们现在完全有权利期望在日内瓦会议上听到西方国家对苏联的建议作出有利于和平的答复。
    建立所有欧洲国家都能参加的欧洲集体安全体系的问题和德国问题的解决，不仅是保障欧洲和平的重大关键，而且也密切关系着世界和平。一个重新武装的西德被拉进北大西洋集团，同建立欧洲集体安全是不能相容的。那只能加深欧洲和德国的分裂，使欧洲局势更加紧张，战争威胁日益加深。苏联坚决主张建立欧洲集体安全体系，主张在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一。苏联的主张既符合德国人民的利益，也符合欧洲人民的利益。西方国家没有任何站得住脚的理由不同意苏联的主张。
    四大国会议必须讨论远东形势。这对于中国人民和亚洲人民有着特殊的意义。美国一再表示不愿意讨论这个问题，这完全不是从缓和局势的愿望，而是从制造紧张、准备战争的要求出发的。这种态度一定要受到世界公正舆论的反对。
    不能否认，四大国会议所面临的任务是复杂而且艰巨的，而且某些别有用心的人还在努力贬低会议，把它说成似乎是无足轻重。有些人则在散播流言蜚语，企图扩大与会各国之间的不信任。他们甚至散播悲观空气，认为会议不可能取得成就。这些人想按照自己的邪恶主张来左右世界。但是世界人民却有自己坚定的了解。会议能否取得成就的关键就在于与会各国之间是否具有解决问题的诚意。历史证明：大国首脑会议能够推动局势的发展。二次大战期间的几次大国首脑会议曾经决定了战局，保证了反法西斯战争的伟大胜利。在战后时期中，一九五四年的四大国外长柏林会议为恢复大国协商打开了道路，导致了有五大国外长参加的日内瓦会议的召开，而在日内瓦会议上终于使恢复印度支那和平的问题获得了解决。
    正如出席会议的苏联代表团在七月十五日发表的声明中所指出的，“如果所有参加会议的人都能表现诚意，真诚地致力于达成协议，毫无疑问，我们会找到共同的基础，拟订出切实可行的办法来有效地解决关系着和平和各国人民的幸福的极其重要的问题”。苏联根据它的和平外交政策，已经表明它将作巨大的努力来达到这些崇高的目的。美国总统艾森豪威尔最近也表示，他虽然对会议“不作太多的期望”，但是他认为，“如果能够找到一些办法使人们消除恐惧和紧张的负担的话，我们应该对这些办法作最大限度的探讨”。他并且说，应该采取“和平的、而不是挑衅的办法”，并且应该抛弃“冷战”这一口号。如果艾森豪威尔真的在四大国会议上把他这些话变成具体的行动，那末世界和平就有可能出现良好的前景。
    世界公众舆论怀着对于和平的热烈憧憬和对于战争的强烈憎恨，一致要求四大国会议在促进国与国之间的相互信任和巩固和平方面作出应有的贡献。苏联已经作了许多努力，美英法三国应当不辜负全世界爱好和平的人民的期望，使会议成为结束“冷战”、进一步缓和国际紧张局势的开始。
    中国人民完全了解自己在维护和平的事业中所担负的重大责任。对于缓和国际紧张局势、消除战争威胁和保障世界和平，我们曾经作了而且还在作着不懈的努力。中国人民热烈欢迎四大国政府首脑会议的召开，并且将和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，为促使会议在解决重大的国际问题方面获得成就而努力。
