Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th: "Pravda" published an editorial on July 7th entitled "The World Mothers' Congress." The editorial stated that the World Mothers' Congress for the Defense of Children Against the Threat of New Wars opens today in Lausanne. The proposal to convene this significant congress has received the warmest response from mothers around the world. Women's organizations from seventy-seven countries have declared their support for the congress and expressed their willingness to actively participate in it.

The editorial pointed out that the World Mothers' Congress, opening immediately after the World Peace Congress, is an important milestone in the struggle of peace-loving people of all countries to consolidate world peace. Women all over the world are closely watching the development of international events. They cannot fail to see the real danger that the arms race carried out by reactionary groups and the act of spreading hostility and distrust among countries bring to the cause of peace. The notorious "position of strength" policy makes women in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, West Germany and other countries worry about their children, their lives and their peace. It increases rents, increases unemployment, and increases taxes to pay for military spending. The "position of strength" policy has built barriers between the people of all countries. The advocates of this policy instill hostility and hatred towards the people of other countries among young people, and spiritually destroy the younger generation. All this cannot but cause unease among the people.

The editorial said that in the ten years since the end of the war, millions of women have united in the world movement to maintain peace and protect children. Everywhere mothers are sending out stern and resolute calls.

The recent development of the international situation, the new and effective steps taken by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to consolidate world peace, have opened up broad prospects for millions of women in all countries, pointed out a clear path for easing tensions, for seeking mutual understanding between countries with different social systems, and for stopping the "Cold War."

Hundreds of millions of mothers warmly endorse the Soviet plan to reduce armaments and ban atomic weapons. This plan is understandable to every mother who cherishes the life and peace of her children, because the realization of this plan means ending the "Cold War," and it means eliminating the terror of the atomic bomb, of the disasters and sacrifices of a new war. The realization of this plan makes it possible to relieve residents of the burden of military taxes and improve the lives of the people of all countries and every family.

For the happiness of their children, mothers of all countries demand that their governments resolve all international disputes by peaceful means. Women of all countries place great hopes on the upcoming four-nation summit conference in Geneva. The struggle for peace requires a strong will and indomitable courage. However, the courage of mothers when they rise up to defend their children is beyond doubt! History knows that in the war years, mothers showed examples of unparalleled heroism. Now, mothers all over the world are defending their children with greater energy and courage. No force can destroy this will and courage!

After listing the preparations made by women of all countries to welcome the World Mothers' Congress, the editorial said that Soviet mothers, like all the Soviet people, have always been and still are at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace. The Soviet delegation will express the will of all our people at the Lausanne Congress - that in the future, they will continue to work tirelessly for the cause of peace, against military blocs, for collective security, for peaceful coexistence, for easing international tensions, and for stopping the "Cold War." Soviet women and mothers, together with all the Soviet people, extend warm congratulations to the World Mothers' Congress, and believe that this congress is a major new step towards the great unity of women all over the world, and it will make a significant contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries to protect children from the threat of new wars.

　　“真理报”发表社论祝贺世界母亲大会开幕
    据新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科七日电：“真理报”七日发表了一篇社论，题目是“世界母亲大会”。社论说，保卫儿童免除新战争威胁的世界母亲大会今天在洛桑开幕。召开这次有重大意义的大会的主张，得到了世界各地母亲们的最热烈的响应。七十七个国家的妇女组织声明支持这个大会，并表示愿意积极参加这个大会。
    社论指出，紧接在世界和平大会之后开幕的世界母亲大会，是各国爱好和平的人民争取巩固世界和平的斗争中的重要里程碑。全世界妇女密切地注视着国际事件的发展。她们不能不看到反动集团进行的军备竞赛和在各国之间散布敌对情绪和不信任气氛的行径给和平事业带来的实际危险。臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策使美国、英国、法国、意大利、西德和其他国家的妇女们为自己的孩子、为他们的生活和安宁而担忧。它使房租上涨、失业增加、赋税加重以充作军费。“实力地位”政策在各国人民之间筑起了壁垒。这种政策的鼓吹者在青年中间灌输对其他国家人民的敌对和仇视情绪，在精神上摧残年青一代。这一切不能不引起人民的不安。
    社论说，在战争结束以来的十年当中，千百万妇女团结到维护和平和保卫儿童的世界运动中来了。到处母亲们都在发出严厉而坚决的呼声。
    最近国际局势的发展，苏联和其他爱好和平国家为巩固世界和平而采取的新的有效步骤，为所有国家千千万万的妇女打开了宽广的远景，为缓和紧张局势、为不同社会制度的国家求得相互谅解和为停止“冷战”指出了一条明确的道路。
    亿万母亲热烈赞同苏联提出的裁减军备和禁止原子武器的计划。这个计划是为珍惜自己孩子的生命与和平的每一位母亲所能理解的，因为实现这个计划就意味着终止“冷战”，就意味着消除对原子弹、对新战争的灾难和牺牲的恐怖。实现这个计划就有可能使居民解除军事捐税的重担，使各国人民和每一个家庭的生活有所改进。
    为了孩子的幸福，各国的母亲要求自己的政府用和平的方法解决所有国际争端。各国妇女对即将在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议寄予巨大的希望。争取和平的斗争要求坚强的意志和不屈不挠的英勇。但是，母亲们在起而保卫自己的孩子的时候的英勇是无容置疑的！历史知道，在战争年月中，母亲们表现了无与伦比的英雄主义的范例。现在，全世界的母亲们以更大的精力和勇气在保卫自己的孩子。没有任何一种力量能够摧毁这种意志和勇气！
    社论列举了各国妇女为迎接世界母亲大会而进行的筹备工作之后说，苏联的母亲，和全体苏联人民一样，过去一直是，现在仍然是站在保卫和平斗争的最前列。苏联代表团将在洛桑的大会上表示我国全体人民的意志——今后仍将始终不倦地为和平事业，为反对军事集团，为争取集体安全，为争取和平共处，为争取缓和国际紧张局势和为停止“冷战”而斗争。苏联妇女和母亲同全体苏联人民一道，向世界母亲大会致以热烈的祝贺，并且相信，这次大会是走向全世界妇女大团结的重大的新步骤，它将对各国人民保卫儿童免遭新战争威胁的斗争作出重大贡献。
