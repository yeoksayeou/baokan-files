The New China Sugar Factory, which is under construction in Jilin Province, has repeatedly studied and reviewed various projects, reduced twenty-three engineering plans, and adopted various methods to reduce costs. According to preliminary statistics, it can save the state more than 500,000 yuan.

In the past, under the influence of the incorrect ideology of "seeking bigness and completeness, and seeking advancement in everything," this factory planned to build some projects even though they were not needed; some projects that could be built in the future were also to be built now; and some projects that could have been built with a small amount of funds were also designed extravagantly in the name of "building modernization" and "long-term planning," wasting a large amount of state funds. For example, for the belt conveyor used on the construction site in winter, the existing warehouse could completely keep it safe, but it was planned to build a new machine warehouse of more than 370 square meters at a cost of more than 90 yuan per square meter. This time, it was decided to cut this project, which can save more than 30,000 yuan. Another example is that the sewage from the workers' village could have been discharged through dirty water ditches, but in order to pursue "modernization," it was planned to build a sewer of 2,300 meters long with a fund of more than 31,000 yuan. This time, after reduction, only one-eighth of the original investment plan was used to solve the problem.

Recently, this factory has also revised the design, removed many unnecessary equipment and decorations, and reduced the project cost. The walls and floors of the boiler room and turbine generator room were originally planned to be paved with tiles, but now they have been replaced with cement. In the beet flume yard, it was originally planned to build a 23-meter-high lighting iron tower, but now it has been changed to a 17-meter-high wooden tower. The cost of the internal painting and attached projects of the two three-story dormitories has also been reduced as much as possible.

Now, the New China Sugar Factory is continuing to mobilize all employees to practice economy in all aspects and strive to save the state 700,000 yuan before the end of the project.

### 新中国制糖厂节约五十多万元

　　新中国制糖厂节约五十多万元
    正在吉林省修建的新中国制糖厂对各项工程反复研究、审查，削减了二十三项工程计划，并采取各种办法降低了造价。据初步统计，可给国家节省资金五十多万元。
    过去，这个厂在“求大求全、一切求先进”的不正确思想支配下，有些工程虽然不需要也计划修建；有些可以在将来修建的也要现在修建；还有些本来可以用少量资金来修建，也以“建设现代化”和“长远打算”为名，很铺张地进行设计，浪费国家的大量资金。如工地上冬季使用的带式运送机，现有的仓库完全可以把它保管好，却计划用九十多元一平方公尺的造价，修建一个三百七十多平方公尺的新机器库。这次决定减掉这项工程，可以节省资金三万多元。又如工人村的污水本来可以挖脏水沟排出，但是为了追求“近代化”，计划用三万一千多元的资金修一条长达二千三百公尺的下水道。这次经过削减，只使用原投资计划的八分之一就解决问题了。
    最近，这个厂又修改了设计，去掉了很多不必要的设备和装饰，降低了工程造价。锅炉房和透平发电机室的墙和地面，原来计划铺磁砖，现在都改用水泥代替。在甜菜流送场，原打算修一个二十三公尺高的照明铁塔，现在改为十七公尺高的木塔了。两栋三层楼宿舍内部的粉刷和附设工程，也尽量降低了造价。
    现在，新中国制糖厂仍继续发动全体职工，从各方面厉行节约，争取在工程结束前为国家节省七十万元资金。
