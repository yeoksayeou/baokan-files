Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report from Karlsruhe: Representatives of the German Communist Party (DKP) made their final statements in the West German Federal Constitutional Court from the 12th to the 14th, exposing the West German government's conspiracy to ban the DKP through a "trial."

	On the 12th, the DKP's legal representative, Krüger, spoke, demanding the cessation of the "trial" of the DKP, because it violates the policy of peaceful reunification of Germany as stipulated in the preamble to the West German constitution. Krüger pointed out that the government's launch of the "trial" against the DKP is an attempt to eliminate its most determined opponents of its rearmament policy.

	On the 13th, the DKP's legal representative, Houch, spoke. He pointed out that the Potsdam Agreement and the West German Constitution stipulate that striving for the reunification of Germany and respecting international law are the responsibility of every German government, and the DKP's program for reunification is constitutional.

	On the 14th, the DKP's representative, Reschke, read out the DKP's statement, exposing the background of the "trial" and the conspiracy to ban the DKP. The statement pointed out that reactionary forces are eager to create a fait accompli before the Geneva Four-Power Summit, in order to obstruct mutual understanding within Germany and internationally. The statement said that the DKP has always stood at the forefront of the opposition to imperialist war, militarism and fascism. The Communist Party will never be defeated because it is inseparable from the working-class movement and conforms to historical development. On this day, the DKP's legal representative, Gauer, also spoke and handed over to the court a petition signed by 23,112 people demanding that the DKP not be banned, and about 500 telegrams expressing the same demand from abroad.

	In recent days, delegations of people from all over Germany have come to Karlsruhe to protest the conspiracy to ban the DKP and demand an end to the "trial." On the afternoon of the 14th, a grand demonstration was also held on the streets of Karlsruhe.

    德共代表在法庭上谴责西德政府的“审讯”
    全德各地人民抗议西德政府压迫德共的阴谋
    新华社柏林十六日电　据德意志通讯社加尔斯卢合消息：德国共产党的代表在十二日到十四日在西德联邦宪法法院的法庭上作最后发言，揭露西德政府阴谋通过“审讯”来禁止德国共产党。
    德国共产党的法律代表克吕格尔在十二日发言，要求停止“审讯”德国共产党，因为这是违反西德宪法序言中所规定的关于和平重新统一德国的政策的。克吕格尔指出：政府发动对德国共产党的“审讯”，是企图消除它的重新武装政策的最坚决的反对者。
    十三日，德国共产党的法律代表胡希发言。他指出：波茨坦协定和西德宪法规定，争取德国的重新统一和尊重国际法是每一个德国政府的责任，德国共产党的争取重新统一的纲领是符合宪法的。
    十四日，德国共产党的代表雷熙宣读了德国共产党的声明，揭露了“审讯”的背景和企图禁止德国共产党的阴谋。声明指出：反动势力急于在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议举行前造成既成事实，以便阻挠德国内部以及国际之间的相互谅解。声明说：德国共产党一向站在反对帝国主义战争、军国主义和法西斯主义的最前列。共产党绝不会被击溃，因为它是同工人阶级的运动分不开的，是符合于历史发展的。在这一天，德国共产党的法律代表高尔也发了言，并且把由两万三千一百一十二人签名的要求不要禁止德国共产党的请愿书和约五百封表达同样要求的来自国外的电报交给了法院。
    连日以来，全德国各地人民的代表团纷纷来到加尔斯卢合，抗议禁止德国共产党的阴谋，要求停止“审讯”。十四日下午，在加尔斯卢合的大街上还举行了盛大的示威游行。
