How Unified Street in Wuhan Adjusted Residents' Grain Purchase Plans
    Wang Jiaxiu
    Unified Street in Wuhan has a total of 3,150 households and 11,695 people. After the implementation of grain supply based on household verification in May this year, many residents were worried that the verified amount of grain would not be enough to eat. By the end of May, 480 households in the entire street had pre-borrowed grain for June, totaling 4,600 jin.
    In response to the above situation, the Jianghan District People's Committee dispatched a working group to go deep into the street to assist the street office in re-checking and verifying the work, and made realistic adjustments to those with high or low verification amounts. A total of 328 households in the entire street were increased, adding 3,205 jin of grain; 360 households were decreased, reducing 3,467 jin of grain. After the adjustment, the average monthly grain consumption level per person in the entire street was more than two jin lower than the consumption level from April to September of last year, and the total grain supply in the entire street was reduced by 262 jin compared with before the re-examination, and the masses expressed satisfaction.
    Unified Street's success in the re-checking and verification work is mainly due to its ability to earnestly implement policies, rely on the broad masses, and make adjustments based on facts.
    First, through a comprehensive review, do a good job of internal screening and ranking, find out the grain consumption and verification situation of each household, and have a clear idea of the situation. The main methods are:
    1. Internal Four-Check Screening and Ranking. That is, check: the number of people eating together from April to September last year and the current population changes; check whether there are any errors in the calculation of the original verified plan; check the reasons for over- or under-verification; check the grain consumption situation from April to September last year. In the four checks, in addition to correcting calculation errors immediately, we mainly rely on residents' activists to find out the reasons why the actual grain consumption calculation results from April to September were too high or too low. After understanding and analysis, the reasons why the actual calculation results from April to September were too high are: more visitors; having people who eat or sell food; having unregistered household members; formal household members working in government agencies but eating at home. The reasons why the actual calculation results from April to September were too low are: flood prevention on the embankment; going out to do temporary work; formal household members working in government agencies but eating at home (such as porters, students, nannies, etc.); visiting relatives; frequent illness; children who didn't eat much in the past now eat more; changes in occupation.
    Based on the above four-check screening, it is clear which households' grain verification amounts are inappropriate. After the four-check screening, it was decided to focus on the small number of households whose grain consumption performance from April to September last year was too high or too low, and therefore the verified grain consumption amount this time was also not appropriate. For these households, we first rely on residents' activists to continue to find out about their situation. Based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, we carefully calculate the details according to each household's population, age, occupational nature, and the number of people actually eating together. Then compare the calculation results with the adjusted number at the end of May to see if it is reasonable, and combine it with the grain pre-borrowing situation of each household at the end of May to conduct preliminary ranking. Except for households that basically remain unchanged, those with high or low situations are divided into three categories: households that should be reduced, households that should be increased, and households that need to be understood (for households that need to be understood, immediately check the population with the public security police station, understand the actual situation, and then decide which category to include), and find out whether the number of grains that should be reduced and the number of grains that should be increased are balanced.
    2. Based on the four-check, understanding situation, and ranking materials, the street director convenes meetings with resident committee directors, grain work representatives, resident group leaders, and activists to discuss. First, explain the reasons and basis for raising or lowering the amount at the meeting, and mobilize everyone to further study. After discussions at the meeting, individual visits, understanding, and adjustments are made immediately to individual households whose verification amount is inappropriate, so that the understanding is combined with the actual situation. In this way, the review work has a certain mass base.
    Secondly, after repeated review and research, after the internal determination of the quantity that should be adjusted, the adjustment is made on a household-by-household basis based on repeated explanation of policies and explaining the great significance of saving grain. In this step, the method adopted by the Unified Street Office is to have the street women's federation hold housewife meetings according to the residents' group, and typical households make key speeches at the meeting. Some of these typical households voluntarily requested to reduce grain, some originally thought that the verified grain was not enough to eat, but after careful calculation, the grain was not only enough to eat but also had surplus, and some were initially verified too little, and the government truthfully increased it. They all talked about their understanding of the grain policy at the meeting through their own personal experiences, their own careful calculation methods, and the benefits of saving grain for the country and themselves. At the meeting, the director of the Women's Federation also made a summary speech based on the ideological situation of the residents and combined with the content of the meeting, and further explained the policy. After the meeting, the resident group leaders and activists were asked to stay and make a final study of the survey data.
    Again, in the specific adjustment, the households with high verification amounts are adjusted first, and then the households with low verification amounts are adjusted. The adjustment of households with high verification amounts relies on residents' committee members and residents' group leaders to adjust household by household. Before the adjustment, they are first told the reasons and basis for the reduction, so that they have a bottom line in their minds. The method adopted is mutual crossing (that is, the backbone of this residents' group adjusts the residents of another residents' group). The adjustment is carried out in the form of household visits. On the one hand, starting from talking about the feelings of the housewife meeting, persuade them from the perspective of reason, and on the other hand, help them calculate the details and prove from the facts that the verified amount is too high, and negotiate the amount that can be reduced. If the negotiated number is close to the internal survey number, the grain purchase certificate is taken back on the spot and the street office reduces it before returning it. With this approach, the households that are reduced are generally more satisfied.
    For households with high verification amounts, the certificates are collected in advance and the planned numbers are adjusted and filled in uniformly. Then, a meeting is convened for households with high verification amounts to explain the reasons for the increase and explain that the government is making adjustments based on the principle of "eating enough without wasting", not only asking for reductions but not increasing; then explain how many households have been increased in total and how many households have been decreased. After the meeting, the resident group leader returns the grain purchase certificates to each household. After the adjustment of the entire street is completed, a small meeting (no more than twenty people) is held, mainly in the form of a housewife meeting. At the meeting, the policy is mainly explained, the adjustment situation is explained, and it is further publicized to save grain, emphasizing that no grain will be pre-borrowed after this adjustment.
    After the adjustment in the above manner, the masses unanimously expressed satisfaction. For example, Lu Yinshuan, a resident of No. 13, Kunyuan Lane, has three adults in his family. The original verification was 32 jin (because he is from the north and often buys noodles outside, the average grain consumption from April to September last year was only 10 jin and 11 taels per person), which was indeed not enough to eat. In this review, he was actively increased by 22 jin of grain. He said: "The government is really seeking truth from facts." Huang Wenhai, a resident of No. 5, Dahuo Lane, has a family of four, two adults and two children, verified as 76 jin. At the end of May, he quarreled with the street government that it was not enough to eat and wanted to borrow grain, and wrote a written application saying that he was short of more than ten jin of grain. In this review, after listening to the typical speech at the housewife meeting, he voluntarily proposed not to request more grain, and took back the written application he had written. Guo Menglan, a resident of No. 166-2, Minquan Road, has a family of five (three adults and two children), originally verified as 87 jin, and quarreled that it was not enough to eat. At the end of May, he went to the street office to ask for grain, saying that he was short of one or two days of grain. After mobilizing him to make a plan and find ways to save grain, he voluntarily requested to reduce 10 jin of grain and changed it to 77 jin.
    At the beginning of this adjustment, a small number of street activists had ideological concerns, especially they did not dare to raise the issue of households that should be reduced. For example, the phenomenon of residents of Minzhong Le Garden residents' group quarreling about not having enough to eat was more serious in the past. At the beginning of this adjustment, the residents' group leader had ideological concerns and had no confidence. After the internal four checks and the convening of housewife meetings to educate and enlighten the masses through typical speeches, as a result, the Minzhong Le Garden residents' group, with a total of 45 households, reduced grain by more than 600 jin, and the work went smoothly, and the masses expressed satisfaction. This not only implemented the policy of grain supply based on household verification, but also effectively educated street staff, opened up their minds, and made it clear that as long as we are serious, responsible, and meticulous in understanding and reviewing in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and implementing policies, the review work can be done well.
    After this centralized review and adjustment, after understanding by street staff, it was found that there were still 24 households with high verification amounts and 18 households with low amounts, and adjustments were made based on facts.
    After repeated investigation and adjustment, the total grain supply in Unified Street was reduced by 336 jin compared with the originally verified amount, and no household in the entire street pre-borrowed grain in June.

    武汉市统一街怎样调整居民的购粮计划
    王嘉修
    武汉市统一街全街共有三千一百五十户、一万一千六百九十五人。今年五月实行粮食按户核实计划供应以后，很多居民都顾虑着怕核定的粮食不够吃。五月底，全街预借六月份粮食的就有四百八十户，共借了粮食四千六百斤。
    针对上述情况，江汉区人民委员会抽派工作人员组成工作组，深入街道协助街办事处复查核实工作，对核实量偏高偏低的都实事求是地进行了调整。总共全街调高的有三百二十八户，增加粮食三千二百零五斤；调低的有三百六十户，减少粮食三千四百六十七斤。调整以后，全街平均每人每月粮食消费水平比去年四至九月份的消费水平要低两斤多，全街粮食供应量比复查以前还减少了二百六十二斤，而且群众也都表示满意。
    统一街在复查核实工作中，主要是能认真贯彻政策，并且依靠广大群众，实事求是地进行调整。
    首先是通过全面复查，作好内部的摸底排队工作，弄清各家粮食消费和核实情况，作到心中有数。主要的作法是：
    一、内部四查摸底排队。即查：去年四至九月的起伙人数和目前人口异动情况；查原核定计划数计算上有无差错；查核高或核低的原因；查去年四至九月用粮情况。在四查中，除对计算上的差错即时更正以外，主要依靠居民积极分子摸清去年四至九月用粮量核算实绩偏大或过小的原因。经过了解分析，四至九月核算实绩偏大原因是：来客较多；有搭饭或卖饭的；有黑户口；正式户口在机关但在家吃饭。四至九月核算实绩过小原因是：防汛上堤；出外做临时工；正式户口在家但在机关吃饭（如搬运工人、学生、保姆等）；串亲走人家；经常有人害病；过去小孩不会吃现在会吃；职业的改变。
    根据以上四查摸底情况，那些户的粮食核实量不恰当，就明显地看出来了。经过四查摸底后，决定把工作重点放在去年四至九月用粮实绩偏大或过小，因而这次核实用粮数也不够恰当的少数户上。对这些户首先依靠居民积极分子继续摸清他们的情况，本实事求是的精神，按每户人口情况、年龄、职业性质、实际起伙人数多寡等，分别进行算细账。然后再把核算结果和五月底调整数比较是否合理，并结合五月底各户预借粮食情况，初步进行排队，除了基本不动的户外，把有偏高偏低情况的分为应减户、应加户和待了解户三类（对待了解户即时和公安派出所查对人口，了解实际情况后再决定并入哪一类），求出应减粮数和应加粮数是否平衡。
    二、根据四查、摸情况、排队的材料，由街主任召集居民委员会主任、粮食工作代表、居民小组长和积极分子等开会讨论，先将调高调低的理由和依据在会上交代清楚，发动大家进一步进行研究。经过会上讨论，对个别核实量不妥当的户又即时进行个别访问了解和调整，使了解数达到与实际结合。这样复查工作就有了一定的群众基础。
    其次，经过复查和反复研究，内部确定了应该调整的数量以后，就在反复交代政策，讲明节约粮食的重大意义的基础上，来按户调整。在这一步工作中，统一街办事处采取的办法就是由街妇联按居民小组开主妇会，会上由典型户作主要发言。这些典型户有的是自动要求核减粮食的，有的是原来认为核的粮不够吃，经过算细账，粮食不但够吃而且有多的，有的是第一次核少了，政府又实事求是地核增的。他们都通过自己的切身体会，在会上谈了自己对粮食政策的认识，他们自己精打细算的办法和节约粮食对国家对自己的好处。会上妇联主任还针对居民思想情况结合会议内容作了总结性的发言，进
  一步交代了政策。会后，叫居民小组长和积极分子留下，把调查数字再作最后的研究。
    再次，在具体调整上，是先调偏高户，再调偏低户。对偏高户是依靠居民委员、居民小组长、逐户调整。在调整前，首先对他们讲清应调低的理由和依据，使他们心中有底，在方式上采取相互交叉的办法（就是这个居民小组的骨干调整另一个居民小组的住户）。在调整中都是以逐户访问的方式进行的，一方面从谈对主妇会的感想入手，从道理上加以说服，一方面帮助算细账，从事实上证明核实量过高，并协商可以减少的数量，如果协商数和内部调查数接近，当时就收回购粮证由街办事处核减后再发还。这样做法，被调低户一般都比较满意。
    对调高户则事先逐户收证统一调整填改计划数，然后召集调高户开会，说明调高理由并交代政府是根据“吃饱不浪费”的原则，实事求是的进行调整，不是只要求调低而不调高；然后交代总的调高了多少户，调低了多少户。会后由居民小组长按户送还购粮证。全街调整完毕后就召开小型会议（不超过二十人），以主妇会形式为主，在会上，主要是交代政策，说明这次调整情况，进一步宣传要节约粮食，强调这次调整后一律不再预借粮食。
    通过以上方式调整后群众都一致表示满意，如坤元里十三号居民卢印宣，全家三口都是大人，原核为三十二斤（因系北方人时常在外面买面食吃，去年四至九月平均用粮每人每月仅十斤十一两），确实不够吃，这次复查中，主动给他增加了二十二斤粮。他说：“政府真是实事求是”。大火巷五号居民黄文海全家四口人，二大二小，核为七十六斤，在五月底向街政府吵不够吃要借粮，并写书面申请说差十几斤粮食。这次复查中在主妇会上听了典型发言后，自动提出不再要求增加粮食，并把所写的申请书要了回去。民权路一六六号之二居民郭梦兰全家五口（三大二小），原核八十七斤，吵不够吃，五月底到街办事处要求借粮，说差一二天的粮食，经过动员他订计划并想办法节省粮食以后，他自动要求减低十斤粮，改为七十七斤。
    在这次开始调整时，有少数街道积极分子思想有顾虑，特别是对应该核减户不敢提出来，如民众乐园居民小组过去群众吵闹不够吃的现象较严重，这次调整时开始居民小组长思想有顾虑，没有信心。经过内部四查和召开主妇会通过典型发言教育启发群众后，结果，民众乐园居民小组共四十五户，核减粮食达六百多斤，且工作进行顺利，群众都表示满意。这不但贯彻了按户核实计划供应政策，并且有力地教育了街道工作人员，打通了思想，明确了只要我们是以实事求是精神认真负责细致的去了解复查，贯彻政策，复查工作是可以作好的。
    这次集中地复查调整以后，经过街道工作人员了解，又发现仍有二十四户核实量偏高，十八户偏低，接着又实事求是地进行了调整。
    经过这样反复调查调整，统一街全街的粮食供应量还比原核定的数量减少了三百三十六斤，而六月份全街没有一户预借粮食的。
