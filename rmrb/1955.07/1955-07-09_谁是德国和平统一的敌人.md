　　Who are the Enemies of Germany's Peaceful Reunification
　　Tan Wenrui

Recently, the American aggressive clique has been trying hard to pretend to care about restoring German unity. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said sanctimoniously at a press conference on June 28, "If there is a sincere desire to promote the cause of peace and eliminate the root causes of international friction, then of course there should be a desire for a unified Germany."

Dulles suddenly talking enthusiastically about the "desire for German unity" is not without reason. As everyone knows, after the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the voices of the German people and the people of Western European countries demanding the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification have become even louder. The American ruling clique also felt that it would be dangerous to directly oppose this wish of the German people and the European people. Therefore, they want to pretend to be supporters of German unity in order to divert everyone's attention from their destructive activities of splitting Germany and obstructing German unity.

In the current situation, the United States and its followers are holding a competition in pretending to support German unity, and there is another ulterior motive. It wants to obstruct the resolution of this issue, sabotage the Four-Power Conference, and shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union when it is forced to discuss the issue of German unity at the Four-Power Conference.

However, the facts cannot be concealed.

Everyone knows that the American ruling clique had been actively planning the permanent division of Germany as early as during World War II. A special advisory committee of the U.S. State Department on postwar issues drafted a plan in 1942 to dismember Germany into three, five, or seven states. A memorandum from the U.S. State Department on August 17, 1943, even stated the arguments for dismembering Germany, advocating dividing Germany into three parts. In the same year, U.S. Secretary of State Hull repeatedly discussed the plan to split Germany with British Foreign Secretary Eden, and later put this plan forward at the Moscow meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. At the Tehran Conference held in October 1943, the U.S. representative once again put forward a similar plan, advocating dividing Germany into five states. In 1944, Sumner Welles, chairman of the U.S. State Department Advisory Committee, put forward another suggestion, advocating dividing Germany into West Germany, South Germany, and East Germany. In the same year, the U.S. government's German Problem Committee approved the Morgenthau Plan, and later the U.S. and British leaders reached an agreement based on this plan at the Quebec Conference, advocating that Germany be divided into two autonomous states, South Germany and North Germany, after the war, and that the Ruhr-Rhine region be an international trusteeship area. These facts undeniably show that during the war, the American ruling clique was determined to remove Germany as a unified, independent, and complete sovereign state from the map. They clearly believed that it would be easier to enslave the German people after dismembering Germany. One of the planners of the dismemberment plan, U.S. wartime Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, said, "Two Germanys are easier to deal with than one."

The Soviet Union took a completely different attitude on this issue. Stalin pointed out in 1942: "We do not have the task of destroying Germany, because it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as it is impossible to destroy Russia." Stalin reaffirmed this position of the Soviet Union when he announced the victory over fascist Germany on May 9, 1945:
  "The Soviet Union is celebrating its triumph, although it does not intend to dismember Germany, nor does it intend to destroy Germany." Robert Sherwood, who served as an official in the U.S. Information Service during the war, wrote in his book "Roosevelt and Hopkins" about the Tehran Conference when the U.S. and Britain put forward the plan to dismember Germany: "Stalin was not enthusiastic about this plan... On the contrary, he did not think there was any difference between the people of one part of Germany and the other. … He said that the Germans always strongly advocated unity..." All of this fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union had established a firm position as early as during the war against Germany to make Germany an independent, democratic, unified, and peaceful country after the war. The Soviet Union's position stemmed from the national aspirations of the German people and also from the interests of lasting peace in Europe.

The two diametrically opposed positions of the Soviet Union and the United States determined the two different policies adopted by the two countries on the German issue after the war. The Soviet Union has always been actively working to promote the restoration of German unity, while the United States and its British allies have tried every means to split Germany. The Soviet Union firmly opposed the plans to dismember Germany put forward by the United States at various international conferences. Due to the Soviet Union's insistence, the United States and Britain agreed to stipulate such a clause in the Potsdam Agreement, which stated that "the Allies do not intend to destroy or enslave the German people, but rather want the German people to have the opportunity to rebuild their lives on a democratic and peaceful basis...." But the Soviet Union's proposal at the Potsdam Conference to establish a pan-German central administrative body was rejected by the United States and Britain. At the various foreign ministers' conferences from 1946 to 1947, the U.S. and Britain stubbornly opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a central administrative body to prepare for the establishment of a pan-German provisional government, and put forward a so-called German federalization plan that actually dismembered Germany into several autonomous states to counter the Soviet Union's efforts to restore German unity. Thus, the London Conference held at the end of 1947 was deadlocked on the issue of restoring German unity. The American ruling clique could not hide their joy at this time. The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote in commenting on the results of the London Conference: "We have reached the end of the road. The era of Yalta is over. … The division of Germany allows us to let go and include West Germany in the system of Western countries." Subsequent facts proved that the United States resolutely embarked on the road of splitting Germany. The United States, Britain, and France turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's appeals to resolve the German issue and the German people's demands for the restoration of unity. On the other hand, they separately implemented currency reforms in West Germany, promulgated the West German occupation regulations, and then created the "Federal Republic of Germany." The United States and its followers thus deepened the division of Germany step by step.

In recent years, the United States' actions to obstruct the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification have been obvious to all. The United States has been evading negotiations to resolve the German issue, refusing to consider a peace treaty with Germany on the pretext that there is no pan-German government, while at the same time doing everything possible to obstruct the establishment of a pan-German government through genuine free elections. At the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference held at the beginning of last year, the Soviet Union put forward many reasonable proposals one after another in order to seek German unity, but the United States, Britain, and France flatly said "no!" Throughout the conference, they did not even put forward a decent counter-proposal to the Soviet Union's many proposals, except for shaking their heads. At that time, they were concentrating on rearming West Germany to block the road to restoring Germany's peaceful reunification. The Paris Agreement signed last year was the result of the United States and its followers pursuing this policy.

One of the means by which the United States obstructs Germany's peaceful reunification is to try its best to refuse to allow the German people to participate in the cause of restoring the unity of their motherland. It opposes the establishment of a pan-German provisional government, opposes free elections by the German people themselves, opposes all measures that help promote understanding between the people of East and West Germany, and even opposes allowing representatives from East and West Germany to participate in international conferences discussing the German issue. The so-called "Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime in West Germany" signed in Paris clearly stipulates that the United States, Britain, and France "reserve their previously enjoyed rights and responsibilities regarding Berlin and the entire Germany, including the reunification of Germany and the signing of a peace treaty." This is in fact depriving the German people of the right to renegotiate the reunification of Germany and the signing of a peace treaty. The United States does not allow the German people to make their own decisions, but wants the United States to make all the decisions. The idea of the American ruling clique is: either impose the West German regime, which is tightly bound to the American chariot, on the entire German people, or Germany will be divided for a long time. This is why the American ruling clique has recently been desperately trying to obstruct West Germany's negotiations with the Soviet Union to establish diplomatic and trade relations. Washington was very annoyed that the West German government had made a preliminary reply of agreement in principle without the consent of the United States, and had to force Adenauer to promise that West Germany would not hold talks with the Soviet Union before the Four-Power Conference, in an attempt to sabotage it again. This is because the United States is deeply afraid that direct contact and improved relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany will be conducive to promoting the restoration of Germany's peaceful reunification. Dulles said bluntly in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 29 this year: West Germany must adopt a policy that does not "harm" the "interests" of the United States on the issue of "reunification or peaceful resolution." What his so-called policy that is in line with the "interests" of the United States is, was clearly stated in a secret memorandum given by some American monopoly capitalists to Dulles in 1953. According to the "New Germany Daily," shortly after the elections in West Germany in September 1953, American monopoly capitalists gave Dulles a memorandum, praising his "tough stance" on the German issue and his policy of not agreeing to the establishment of a pan-German government. The memorandum said: Such a policy is the best way to protect the interests of American monopoly capitalists, because if East and West Germany are reunited, it may strengthen the neutral tendency there and prevent West German industry from being incorporated into military production, so that the profits of American trusts that maintain close relations with German companies will be greatly reduced. This "private talk" most thoroughly stated the ulterior motives behind the United States' policy of splitting Germany.

The American ruling clique clearly wants to use the Paris Agreement as an effective tool to prevent German unity. American commentator Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" on December 14, 1954: One of the basic assumptions of the Paris Agreement is that the division of Germany will last for a considerable period of time... The decision to rearm West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization confirms that the existing division of Germany during the period when the agreement is in effect is permanent." When public opinion in various countries recently strongly demanded that the issue of German unity be resolved through negotiations, the United States tried to make West Germany quickly establish its "Defense Force" before the Four-Power Conference, using the established fact of rearming West Germany to create more obstacles to German unity. But this practice of the United States is extremely unpopular even in West Germany. The conscription bill proposed by the Adenauer government has met with strong opposition in both the upper and lower houses of the West German parliament. German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer pointed out in the debate that the debate on military issues runs counter to the policy of restoring German unity. The debate in the Bonn Parliament reflected the aspirations of the people of West Germany. More and more people have realized who is trying to make it impossible to restore Germany's peaceful reunification.

Falsehood is falsehood. The United States wants to steal the banner of reunifying Germany to cover up its conspiracy to continue to obstruct German unity, and it will not succeed.

　　谁是德国和平统一的敌人
　　谭文瑞
    最近以来，美国侵略集团竭力装作关心恢复德国统一的样子。美国国务卿杜勒斯六月二十八日在记者招待会中道貌岸然地说：“如果有促进和平事业和消除国际摩擦根源的真诚愿望的话，当然应当有统一德国的愿望。”
    杜勒斯忽然热心地谈论起“德国统一的愿望”来，这不是没有原因的。大家知道，巴黎协定实施以后，不论是德国人民和西欧各国人民要求恢复德国和平统一的呼声都愈加高涨了。美国统治集团也感觉到，要想直接反对德国人民和欧洲人民的这个愿望，是危险的。因此他们就想装扮成为德国统一的拥护者，以转移大家对他们分裂德国和阻挠德国统一的破坏活动的注意。
    就目前的情况来说，美国同它的追随者们在伪装赞成德国统一的活动上举行竞赛，还有一个不可告人的动机。它想在四国会议上被迫就统一德国问题进行讨论时，设法阻挠这个问题的解决，破坏四国会议，并把责任推到苏联头上。
    然而，事实是无法掩盖的。
    谁都知道，美国统治集团早在第二次世界大战期间就已经积极在策划永久分裂德国的勾当。美国国务院的一个专门研究战后问题的咨询委员会在一九四二年就草拟过把德国肢解为三个、五个或者七个邦的计划。美国国务院一九四三年八月十七日的备忘录中并且陈述了肢解德国的论据，主张把德国分裂三部分。同年，美国国务卿赫尔曾一再同英国外交大臣艾登商量过分裂德国的计划，后来并把这个计划在莫斯科美、英、苏三国外长会议上提出来。在一九四三年十月举行的德黑兰会议上，美国代表并曾再一次提出了类似的计划，主张把德国分裂成为五个邦。一九四四年，美国国务院咨询委员会主席萨姆纳·韦尔斯提出了另外一个建议，主张把德国分裂为西德、南德和东德三国。同年美国政府的德国问题委员会批准了摩根韬计划，后来美英首脑在魁北克的会议就以这个计划为基础达成了协议，主张战后把德国分成为南德和北德两自治邦，而把鲁尔—莱因区作为国际托管地区。这些事实无可置辩地说明，在战争期间，美国统治集团就一心想把德国作为一个统一、独立的和完整的主权国家而从地图上划掉，他们显然认为把德国肢解之后易于奴役德国人民。肢解德国计划的策划者之一，美国战时的财政部长摩根韬就说过：“两个德国比一个德国好对付”。
    苏联在这个问题上却抱着完全不同的态度。斯大林在一九四二年就指出：“我们没有抱定任务要去消灭德国，因为不可能消灭德国，犹之不可能消灭俄国一样。”斯大林在一九四五年五月九日宣布战胜法西斯德国的时候，重申苏联的这种立场：
  “苏联在庆祝凯旋，虽然它并不打算瓦解德国，也不打算消灭德国。”战时，担任美国新闻处官员的罗伯特·塞尔伍德在他所著的“罗斯福和霍普金斯”一书中谈到在德黑兰会议上当美英提出肢解德国的计划时写道：“斯大林对于这种计划是不热心的……相反的他认为德国这一部分和另一部人民并没有什么分别。……他说德国人方面总是强烈主张统一的……”这一切都充分表明，苏联早在对德战争期间就确定了要使德国在战后成为一个独立、民主、统一和和平的国家的坚定立场。苏联的这种立场是从德国人民的民族愿望出发，也是从欧洲的持久和平利益出发的。
    苏联和美国两种截然不同的立场，决定了战后两国在德国问题上所采取的两种不同的政策。苏联一直是积极努力促成恢复德国的统一，美国和它的英国盟国则千方百计要分裂德国。美国在历次国际会议上提出的肢解德国的计划，苏联都坚决表示反对。由于苏联的坚持，美国和英国才同意在波茨坦协定中规定了这样一项条款，即声明“盟方并无毁灭或奴役德国人民之心意，盟方实欲德国人民获得机会，在民主及和平之基础上重建其生活。……”但是苏联在波茨坦会议上提出成立一个全德中央行政机构的建议，却为美国和英国所否决。在一九四六年到一九四七年的各次外长会议上，美英顽固反对苏联关于建立一个中央行政机构来筹备成立全德临时政府的建议，并且提出了实际上是把德国肢解为几个自治邦的所谓德国联邦化的计划来同苏联恢复德国统一的努力相对抗。这样，一九四七年底举行的伦敦会议就在恢复德国统一问题上陷于僵局。美国统治集团这时候掩饰不住他们的高兴。“纽约先驱论坛报”在评论伦敦会议的结果时写道：“我们已经走到路的尽头了。雅尔塔的时代已经过去了。……德国的分裂可以使我们放手把西德列入西方国家的体系以内了。”以后的事实证明，美国果然不顾一切地走上了分裂德国的道路。美英法一方面对苏联催促解决德国问题的呼吁和德国人民要求恢复统一的呼声置若罔闻。另一方面它们却从在西德单独实行货币改革、公布西德占领法规进而制造了“德意志联邦共和国”。美国和它的追随者们就这样步步加深德国分裂。
    近几年来，美国阻挠德国恢复和平统一的行径更是人所共见的。美国一直规避谈判解决德国问题，借口还没有一个全德政府，拒绝考虑对德国和约，同时它又百般阻挠通过真正的自由选举来促成全德国政府的成立。在去年年初举行的柏林四外长会议上，苏联为了谋求德国统一，先后提出了许多合理建议，但是美英法却一口咬定说“不！”在整个会议上，它们对苏联的许多建议除了摇头之外，甚至连一个像样的对案都没有提出。其时，它们正在专心致志地要重新武装西德来堵塞恢复德国和平统一的道路。去年签订的巴黎协定就是美国和它的跟班们推行这种政策的结果。
    美国阻挠德国和平统一的一种手段，就是竭力拒绝让德国人民自己来参加恢复祖国统一的事业。它反对成立全德临时政府，反对由德国人民自己来举行自由选举，反对一切有助于促进德国东西两部人民谅解的措施，甚至反对让东西德的代表参加讨论德国问题的国际会议。在巴黎签订的所谓“关于终止在西德占领制度的议定书”，就明白规定：美、英、法“三国保留它们以前所享受的关于柏林及整个德国的权利和责任，其中包括重新统一德国及签订和约在内。”这事实上就是剥夺了德国人民经过谈判来重新统一德国和签订和约的权利。美国不让德国人民自己作主，是要一切由美国来作主。美国统治集团的主意就是：要么把被美国紧紧绑在美国战车上的西德政权强加到全德人民的头上，要么德国长期分裂。这就是为什么美国统治集团最近拚命想要阻挠西德同苏联进行建立外交和贸易关系的谈判。华盛顿方面，对于西德政府没有得到美国的同意就作了原则上赞同的临时答复甚为恼火，只好迫使阿登纳答应，西德不在四国会议以前同苏联举行会谈，以图再设法进行破坏。这是因为美国深恐苏联和西德的直接接触和改善关系会有利于促成德国和平统一的恢复。杜勒斯今年三月二十九日在美国参议院外交委员会上曾露骨地说过：西德在“重新统一或和平解决”的问题上，必须采取一种不“损害”美国“利益”的方针。他的所谓符合美国“利益”的方针是什么，在美国一些垄断资本家一九五三年交给杜勒斯的一份秘密备忘录中曾说得很明白。据“新德意志报”报道，在一九五三年九月西德举行选举后不久，美国垄断资本家就曾把一份备忘录给杜勒斯，夸奖他在德国问题上所采取的“强硬方针”和不答应建立全德政府为基础的政策。该备忘录说：这样的方针和政策才是保护美国垄断资本家利益的最好方法，因为如果东西德重归统一的话，那就可能加强那里的中立倾向，并妨碍把西德工业纳入军事生产的轨道，这样同德国公司保持密切关系的美国托辣斯的利润就会大大减少。这一番“私房话”最透彻不过地说出了美国分裂德国政策的背后的不可告人的目的。
    美国统治集团显然要把巴黎协定作为阻止德国统一的一个有效的工具。美国的评论家李普曼在一九五四年十二月十四日“纽约先驱论坛报”上曾写道：巴黎协定的一个基本的假设就是德国的分裂将延续一个相当长的时期……在北大西洋公约组织中重新武装西德的决定，就是肯定了在协定生效期间德国现存的分裂就是永久不变的。”当最近各国舆论都热烈要求通过谈判来解决德国统一问题的时候，美国就力图使西德赶快在四大国会议举行之前建立起它的“国防军”，用重新武装西德的既成事实来给德国统一制造更多的障碍。但是美国的这种做法，即使是在西德也是极不得人心的。阿登纳政府提出的募兵法案在西德议会上下两院中都遭到了强烈的反对。德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在辩论中指出，关于军事问题的辩论是同恢复德国统一的政策背道而驰的。波恩议会的辩论反映出了西德的人心所向。越来越多的人都认清了，究竟是什么人竭力要使德国恢复和平统一成为不可能。
    假的就是假的。美国想窃取重新统一德国的旗帜，来遮掩它继续阻挠德国统一的阴谋，是办不到的。
