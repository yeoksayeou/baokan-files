    National People's Congress Representatives and People from All Walks of Life in Shanghai
    Endorse the Arrest of Counter-Revolutionary Elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng

    (Reported by this newspaper) Many representatives of the National People's Congress have made statements warmly endorsing the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng.

    Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, said: Pan Hannian's counter-revolutionary crimes are extremely serious. His exposure is another great victory for the Party and the people after crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We were really too careless in the past, and we must be a hundred times more vigilant in the future. I firmly believe that in the face of the people's high vigilance and powerful strength, any conspiracy of the most hidden and cunning counter-revolutionary double-dealers will eventually be shattered.

    Zhang Qi, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said: The successive exposure of the Pan Hannian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements is a major victory for our working class in the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the initial exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, many workers in Shanghai were still very careless, thinking it had nothing to do with the workers. It was not until the in-depth exposure of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary facts that everyone realized the seriousness of this counter-revolutionary incident. Today, Pan Hannian's counter-revolutionary incident has sounded the alarm for our Shanghai workers. Our working class must learn from these lessons, raise our vigilance, and continue to carry out a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionary elements.

    Geng Changsuo, a model agricultural laborer, said: I fully support the arrest and trial of the two counter-revolutionary elements, Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, and demand severe punishment according to law. The destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements in rural areas are also very serious. More than 700 of our cooperative's cotton seedlings were cut off by bad people at night. This series of events further illustrates that the enemy is sabotaging our cause from all sides. We must be vigilant and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    Huang Runping, a model worker in Beijing, said: I felt an unspeakable sense of relief when I heard that the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng were arrested and tried. The government is really doing good things for the people by eliminating such a great scourge.

    Ma Zhemin, Director of the Wuhan Branch of the China Democratic League and President of the Zhongnan University of Economics and Finance, said: The arrest and trial of the two counter-revolutionary elements, Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, is truly gratifying. It is extremely necessary to carry out the movement to eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and it should be carried out more deeply. I and several other representatives submitted a proposal requesting the arrest and prosecution of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements. Now I also hope that a public trial will be held to try these counter-revolutionary elements.

    Sha Ting, a representative from Sichuan, said: The handling of the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng is completely justified, and it is a heartening news. After the publication of the first and second batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, all sectors of Sichuan were very angry and demanded an investigation into Hu Feng's political background. The enlarged meeting of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference proposed revoking his qualifications as a People's Representative. After the publication of the third batch of materials, even more people demanded his punishment. The Pan Hannian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary cases further illustrate the intensification of class struggle during the transition period.

    Zhou Xinfang, a famous Peking opera actor, said: I fully support the decision to arrest and try the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident has already been a profound lesson for people in the cultural and artistic circles. Now that Pan Hannian's counter-revolutionary crimes have been exposed, this is another alarm bell ringing for us. We must learn from the lessons, raise our revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: After receiving the news that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had approved the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, people from all walks of life in Shanghai expressed their warm support and unanimously demanded that these counter-revolutionary elements be severely punished.

    On the day they received the news, staff and workers from many organizations, groups, and factories in Shanghai held meetings and discussions, and wrote letters or made phone calls to newspapers, demanding that Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, the two counter-revolutionary elements, be severely punished. Communist Party members participating in the enlarged meetings held by the Huangpu District Committee and the Tilanqiao District Committee of the Communist Party of China expressed great anger at the counter-revolutionary element Pan Hannian, who had deceived the Party and gained important positions such as the Third Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai. They said: The exposure of the counter-revolutionary element Pan Hannian has further cleared our minds. We must take action and join the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. Many employees and model workers at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory warmly supported the arrest and trial of the counter-revolutionary elements Pan Hannian and Hu Feng.

    全国人民代表大会代表和上海各界人民
    拥护逮捕反革命分子潘汉年胡风
    本报讯　全国人民代表大会许多代表发表谈话，热烈拥护将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判。
    上海市副市长金仲华说：潘汉年的反革命罪行是极严重的，它的被揭露是党和人民在粉碎胡风反革命集团之后取得的又一个大胜利。过去我们实在麻痹得厉害，今后必须百倍提高警惕。我坚决相信在人民的高度警觉和强大力量面前，任何最隐蔽最狡猾的反革命两面派的阴谋，最后都是会被粉碎的。
    上海市工会联合会副主席张祺说：潘汉年和胡风反革命分子事件的相继揭发，这是我们工人阶级在共产党的领导下同反革命分子进行斗争中所取得的一项重大胜利。在最初揭露胡风反革命事件中，我们上海很多工人还十分麻痹，认为和工人无关系，直到胡风反革命事实深入揭发以后，大家才认识了这一反革命事件的严重性。今天潘汉年的反革命事件更向我们上海工人敲响了警钟。我们工人阶级一定要吸取教训，提高警惕，继续开展同反革命分子的坚决斗争。
    农业劳动模范耿长锁说：我完全拥护逮捕审判潘汉年、胡风两个反革命分子，并要求依法严惩。农村中反革命分子的破坏活动也很厉害，我们社内的棉苗就曾在夜里被坏人割掉七百多棵。这一连串的事件更说明了敌人正从各方面破坏我们的事业。我们必须提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    北京市劳动模范黄润萍说：听说把反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判，我心里真有说不出的痛快。政府真是给人民办好事，除了这样的大害。
    中国民主同盟武汉市支部主任委员、中南财经学院院长马哲民说：将潘汉年、胡风两个反革命分子逮捕审判，真是大快人心。目前开展肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的运动，极为必要，应该更深入地开展。我曾经和其他几位代表提出提案，要求逮捕法办胡风这批反革命分子，现在我还希望，召开公审大会审判这批反革命分子。
    四川代表沙汀说：对反革命分子潘汉年和胡风的处理完全应该，这是一个大快人心的消息。关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二批材料公布后，四川各界都很愤怒，要求追查胡风的政治背景，省政协扩大会议提出撤销他人民代表的资格。第三批材料公布后，要求惩办他的人就更多了。潘汉年、胡风反革命案件更说明过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化。
    著名京剧演员周信芳说：我完全拥护逮捕审判潘汉年、胡风反革命分子的决定。胡风反革命事件，对我们文化艺术界人士的教训已经是很深了，现在又揭露了潘汉年的反革命罪行，这又一次向我们敲起了警钟。我们一定要接受教训，提高革命的警惕性，坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    据新华社上海十八日电　上海市各界人民得到全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准把反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判的消息以后，都表示热烈拥护，一致要求严厉惩办这些反革命分子。
    上海市许多机关、团体、工厂的工作人员和工人们，在获得消息的当天，分别集会座谈，和写信或打电话给报社，要求严办潘汉年、胡风这两个反革命分子。正在参加中共黄浦区委员会和提篮桥区委员会举行的扩大会议的共产党员们，对曾骗取中共上海市委员会第三书记和上海市副市长等重要职务的、钻进党内的反革命分子潘汉年，表示极大的愤怒。他们说：反革命分子潘汉年的揭露，进一步清醒了我们的头脑，我们要行动起来，投入肃清一切反革命分子的斗争。国营上海机床厂许多职工、劳动模范都热烈拥护把反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判。
