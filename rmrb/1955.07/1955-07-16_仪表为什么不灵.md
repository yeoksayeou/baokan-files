    Why Are Instruments Malfunctioning?
    By our reporter, Fang Qing
    At the Shenyang Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, a dispute arose between the buyer and seller over an electric meter:
    Buyer: "Look, the needle isn't moving at all, proving the meter is broken. Please give me a good one."
    Seller: "No, you took this meter yourself from the warehouse. The needle was moving then; you should be responsible for the damage."
    Buyer: "I didn't drop and break it."
    Seller: "Because it was good when you took it..."
    As they were arguing, an instrument repairman came over, disassembled the meter, and found that the hairspring inside was broken. He replaced it with a good one on the spot, the needle moved, and the buyer bought it.
    It turned out that this instrument repairman was specially sent by the Acheng Instrument Factory to inspect the quality of the instruments. The electric meters sold by the Shenyang Transportation Electrical Equipment Company were products of their factory.
    Many poor-quality products from the Acheng Instrument Factory were sent out, and ordering units raised criticisms one after another. This factory had no choice but to send out a large number of people for repairs. In the past three years, in Shenyang alone, more than 40,000 instruments produced by the Acheng Instrument Factory were backlogged for repair (some of which were damaged due to poor storage by the ordering units). This factory sent out a repair team of more than 30 people in January of this year, and they have been repairing in Shenyang for a full five months. At the same time, users who bought products from the Acheng Instrument Factory in places like Beijing and Changsha also frequently sent letters criticizing the poor quality. The factory sent out "quality visiting groups" to inspect and found that six ordering units had 16,500 products needing repair, and many were rejects that could not be shipped at all. The cost of the rejects produced by the factory in 1954 was worth 220,000 yuan.
    The main reason for the poor product quality is that the leading comrades of the Acheng Instrument Factory were blindly complacent, fond of boasting and exaggerating, did not delve into technology, and did not study advanced Soviet experience well, thinking that "instruments are difficult to make, and it is inevitable to produce rejects." In 1953, because they completed the annual production task 45 days ahead of schedule, the Acheng Instrument Factory won the title of "Advanced Unit" within the Electrical Industry Administration system. Due to the needs of national industrial development, the factory had 33 new product varieties in 1953 and another 67 in 1954. The number of ordering units also increased from 200 to 560 at the same time. In supporting the construction of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, they did contribute a lot and continuously received thank-you letters, big red flags, and silver shields from the other party. In particular, the instruments and electricity meters they produced were called the "eyes of industry" by users. Therefore, they developed a sense of blind complacency and a series of mistakes.
    The leading personnel of the Acheng Instrument Factory did not carefully consider their technical strength, so that among the 67 new products in 1954, 30 were not successfully designed at all. For example, the Harbin Linen Textile Factory ordered thermal relays, and the Acheng Instrument Factory proceeded with the design without considering whether they could make it. After the drawings were completed, they realized that two kinds of materials needed for it were imported goods, which could not be bought for a while; after further understanding, this kind of product should be undertaken by the low-voltage switch factory according to the division of labor. Among the 37 products that completed the design, due to the rough design, 36 drawings were reworked and modified as many as 248 times. Among them, a complex electricity meter was modified 60 times in the three months of production. With such constant changes, how could the product quality be guaranteed to meet the standards? Therefore, only 17 of these 67 new products were put into production in the end.
    Because the leading comrades did not correctly estimate their technical strength and only cared about taking on more work, the technical personnel were sloppy. Most products did not have process regulations written, nor did they explain the design intention and precautions in the operation process to the workshop. They did not go deep into the trial production process to review their drawings. Therefore, errors occurred continuously in each trial production process. When workers had problems, they would go to the technical personnel to solve them. Sixty percent of the technical personnel's time was spent being called to the workshop by the workers, which made the work passive step by step. On the one hand, the production situation in the workshop did not strictly implement the new product trial production system, and often cross-proceeded with trial production and batch production, resulting in batches of defective products. On the other hand, it did not adhere to the process regulations. Once, when the fourth workshop was manufacturing magnets, the workshop director clearly knew that it did not meet the process regulations, but still insisted on doing it with the idea of ​​"taking a chance," resulting in a batch of defective products. The seventh workshop only cared about its own assembly. Knowing that the parts from the second workshop were not up to specifications, they insisted on assembling them, which affected the repair of the entire product, while the seventh workshop thought it had "completed the assembly task." If the inspection personnel could carefully check the product quality, they would also check out all the substandard problems in the design and production process. However, their acceptance work was not strict. Some workers said: The acceptance is easy to pass, the inspector's eyes are calipers, and the mouth is a certificate of conformity. Some workers deliberately sent unqualified products for inspection twice, and some even stole the qualified seal. The inspection standards of the acceptance personnel are not uniform. Sometimes, when encountering strict inspectors, they often argue with the workers, all the way to the factory director. The factory director believes that it is a pity to scrap the parts, so he comes forward as an "arbitrator" to mediate, persuading the inspectors to accept them "reluctantly." In another situation, like the hairspring problem of the electric meter mentioned earlier, it was good during acceptance, but it would be damaged with a slight vibration; sometimes it was damaged during transportation due to poor packaging.
  From the entire production process, there are loopholes everywhere that cause poor product quality. If a link is not cautious, it will produce returned or defective products. Therefore, the Acheng Instrument Factory must comprehensively check its work and tighten every link. But more importantly, the leadership must implement strict technical requirements in every production process to block the loopholes that cause rejects. Although some veteran workers have manufactured the most precise gears on electricity meters without precise tools, and although they have used the "copycat" method to manufacture precise instruments without machines in the past, this is after all based on experience, eyesight, and craftsmanship, rather than relying on science and technology. Therefore, this is not fully based and is a matter of "luck."
    At the end of last year, after the superior leading organs made strict criticisms of the poor product quality of the Acheng Instrument Factory, they conducted a thorough technical inspection and found the "five major keys" that most seriously affected the quality in eight major products. For example, some aluminum parts used on electric meters were only made quickly in the past. After die-casting, they were immediately drilled and assembled. The inspection was also qualified at the time, but over time, some die-cast parts often deformed and had to be repaired. At that time, they did not know what the reason was. In the process of checking the quality, they learned from advanced Soviet experience and realized that after die-casting, they must go through a certain period of stabilization treatment before drilling and assembling can prevent deformation forever. This fully illustrates that as long as you use your brains to delve into technology, you can improve product quality. In the past, some workshop directors and veteran workers believed that "Soviet experience is too strict, we can't learn it," and "instruments are very precise things, it is impossible not to produce rejects." After this study, they understood that many profound scientific principles are interspersed in the ordinary production process, and there is nothing unfathomable. From this, it can be inferred that improving the product quality of the Acheng Instrument Factory is not a mysterious thing.
    The product quality of the Acheng Instrument Factory has only begun to improve, and the factory's leading comrades still need to be determined to improve quality and brighten our "eyes of industry."

    仪表为什么不灵
    本报记者　方青
    在沈阳交通电工器材公司里，买卖双方曾经为一个电表发生争执：
    采买员：“你看，表针一点也不动，证明电表是坏的；请给我换好的。”
    推销员：“不，这个电表是你自己从仓库里拿出来的；那时表针还在动，坏了应当由你负责。”
    采买员：“并不是我把它摔坏的。”
    推销员：“因为你拿到手时还是好货……”
    双方正在相持不下，有一位仪表修理工走过来，把电表卸开，发现里面的游丝断了。他当场给换了一根好的，表针动起来了，采购员就买走了。
    原来这位仪表修理工是阿城仪表厂特地派来检查仪表质量的。沈阳交通电工器材公司出售的电表，就是他们厂的产品。
    阿城仪表厂许多质量不好的产品送出去，订货单位纷纷提出指责，这个工厂只好派出大批人员去进行返修。三年以来，仅在沈阳一地就积压了阿城仪表厂生产的四万多只仪表要返修（其中有部分是订货单位保管不好弄坏的）。这工厂在今年一月份派出一个由三十多人组成的返修大队，在沈阳已经足足修了五个月。同时，阿城仪表厂卖给北京、长沙等地的产品，使用单位也经常来信指责质量不好。工厂派出“质量访问组”去检查，发现六个订货单位就有一万六千五百只产品需要返修，还有很多是根本不能出厂的废品。工厂在一九五四年出产的废品，按成本计算就值二十二万元。
    造成产品质量低劣的主要原因，是由于阿城仪表厂领导同志的盲目自满，好大喜功，不深入钻研技术，不好好学习苏联先进经验，认为“仪表难作，出废品难免”。一九五三年由于提前四十五天完成全年的生产任务，阿城仪表厂曾在电器工业管理局系统内获得了“先进单位”的称号。由于国家工业发展的需要，该厂一九五三年新产品品种有三十三种，一九五四年又增加了六十七种，订货单位也在同时由二百户增加到五百六十户。在支援鞍钢三大工程建设中，他们也确实出了很大力气，连续得到对方送来的感谢信、大红旗和银盾。特别是他们所生产的仪表、电度表，是被订户称为“工业的眼睛”的。他们因此就滋长了盲目自满的情绪，产生了一系列的错误。
    阿城仪表厂的领导人员没有好好考虑自己的技术力量，以致在一九五四年六十七种新产品中，根本没有设计成功的就有三十种。如哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂订购的热力继电器，阿城仪表厂没有考虑能不能做，就进行设计。图纸画好了，才发现它所需要的器材有两种是进口货，一时买不来；再进一步了解，这种产品按照分工应当由低压开关厂承做。在完成了设计的三十七种产品里，由于设计粗糙，竟有三十六种图纸返工修改了二百四十八次之多。其中有一种复杂的电度表，在投入生产的三个月内，图纸修改了六十次。这样改来改去，怎么能保证产品质量合乎标准呢？因此，这六十七种新产品中到后来只有十七种投入了生产。
    由于领导同志没有正确估计自己的技术力量，只顾多揽活，技术人员便粗制滥造，大部分产品不编写工艺规程，也不将设计意图和操作过程中应注意的事项向车间说清楚，更没有深入到试制过程中去审查自己的图纸，因而在每一试制过程中，不断发生错误。工人一有问题，就去找技术人员来解决，技术人员有百分之六十的时间被工人叫到车间里去，这样就使得工作步步被动。车间里的生产情况是一方面没有严格执行新产品试制制度，往往把试制和成批生产交叉进行，造成成批的废品。另一方面是不坚持工艺规程，第四车间有一次制造磁铁时，车间主任明知不符合工艺规程，还抱着“碰碰看”的思想，坚持要做下去，结果产生了一批废品。第七车间只顾自己装配，明知第二车间的部件不合规格，也一定要求装配，结果影响整个产品返修，而第七车间还以为“完成了装配任务”。如果检验人员能认真地检查产品质量，也会把设计、生产过程中的一切不合标准的问题都检查出来的。但他们的验收工作不严格。有些工人说：验收这一关好过，检查员的眼睛是千分尺，嘴是合格证。有些工人故意将不合格的产品二次又送去检查，有的甚至偷盖合格印。验收人员的检验标准不统一，有时遇到严格的检查员，就往往同工人发生争论，一直争论到厂长那里去，厂长认为部件作废太可惜，便以“仲裁人”方式出面调停，说服检查员“将就”收下。另外一种情况，像前面说的电表的游丝问题，验收时是好的，可是稍一震动就会弄坏；也有时因为包装不好，在运输途中弄坏了。
  从整个生产过程来看，到处有造成产品质量低劣的漏洞，一个环节不谨慎，就会产生返修品或废品，因此，阿城仪表厂必须全面检查工作，把每一个环节都紧一紧。但更重要的是领导上必须把严格的技术要求贯彻到每一个生产过程中去，才能把造成废品的漏洞堵死。尽管有些老工人不用精密的工具也曾经制造过电度表上最精密的牙轮，尽管过去用“照葫芦画瓢”的办法，不用机器也制造过精密的仪表，但这毕竟是凭经验，凭眼力，凭手艺，而不是依靠科学技术，因此这是没有充分根据的，是“碰”上的。
    去年年终，上级领导机关对阿城仪表厂的产品质量低劣现象提出了严格批评后，他们在技术上作了一次深刻的检查，在八种主要产品中，找到了影响质量最严重的“五大关键”。像电表上所用的一些铝质零件，过去只图快，压铸以后立即钻眼、装配，当时检查也合格，但时间长了，一些压铸的零件往往变形，必须返修，当时不知道是什么原因。在检查质量过程中，他们学习了苏联先进经验，才了解到压铸以后，必须经过一定时期的稳定处理过程，再钻眼、装配，才能永不变形。这就充分说明了只要开动脑筋钻研技术，就会把产品质量提高。过去有的车间主任、老工人认为“苏联经验太严格，我们学不来”，“仪表是很精密的东西，不可能不出废品”，经过这次学习，使他们理解到很多科学上深奥的道理，都是贯穿到平凡的生产过程中的，决没有什么深不可测的。由此可以推论，改进阿城仪表厂的产品质量，也就不是什么神秘事情了。
    阿城仪表厂的产品质量才开始好转，厂的领导同志还需要下决心提高质量，把我们的“工业的眼睛”擦亮。
