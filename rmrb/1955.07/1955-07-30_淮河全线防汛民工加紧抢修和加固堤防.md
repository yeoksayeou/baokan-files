Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, July 29th: After the retreat of the second flood peak in the Huai River, flood control workers along the upper, middle, and lower reaches are seizing the opportunity to repair and reinforce embankments. Many dangerous sections have been discovered in the embankments of tributaries in the upper reaches of the Huai River after this flood test, and they are now being rapidly repaired. Of the 74 dangerous sections on the Sha River, 40 have been repaired. The repair projects for 50 dangerous sections on the Hong River, Liu Yan River, and three other rivers will be completed soon. The embankment reinforcement projects in the middle reaches of the Huai River are mostly concentrated on the Huai Bei Dike, Wo Dong Dike, and Shang Ge Dike. Dangerous sections of the Huai Bei Dike such as Yu Shan Ba have been repaired. To date, more than 3.1 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed for embankment reinforcement projects in the middle reaches. In the lower reaches of the Huai River, the Grand Canal dikes, which defend the vast farmland of northern Jiangsu, are also being repaired. The reinforcement project of the east dike of the Grand Canal has been mostly completed, and the west dike is being heightened and filled with earth. More than 1,300 wooden boats are being used by the people along the coast to transport earth. The stone revetment project of the Hongze Lake Dike and the reinforcement project of the south dike of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal are also under intense construction.
	While repairing the embankments, the Huai River Harnessing Committee of the CPC issued instructions to all flood control construction sites in the middle reaches to strengthen security work. It requires all flood control agencies to establish flood control security organizations, strengthen the guarding of闸坝 (zhaba - a type of dam), embankments, and equipment and materials, patrol important sections, and strictly prevent counter-revolutionaries from sabotage.

    淮河全线防汛民工加紧抢修和加固堤防
    新华社蚌埠二十九日讯　淮河第二个洪峰消退之后，上中下游上堤防汛的民工正抓紧时机抢修和加固堤防。淮河上游许多支流的堤防，经过这次洪水考验发现多处险工，目前正在迅速整修。沙河的七十四处险工，已有四十处修好。洪河、柳堰河等五条河道的五十处险工整修工程最近就要完工。淮河中游的堤防加固工程大都集中在淮北大堤、涡东大堤和上格堤等堤线上。淮北大堤上禹山坝等险要堤段已整修好。到目前止，中游的堤防加固工程已完成土方三百一十万公方以上。淮河下游，捍卫苏北广大农田的运河堤防也在整修中。其中运河东堤加固工程已大部分结束，西堤正紧张加高上土。沿岸人民驾驶着一千三百多只木船参加运土。洪泽湖大堤的块石护坡工程、苏北灌溉总渠南堤加固工程也都在紧张施工。
    在抢修堤防的同时，中共治淮委员会对中游各防汛工地发出了加强保卫工作的指示，要求各防汛机构必须建立防汛保卫组织，加强对闸坝、堤防、器材物资的看守，巡逻险要工段，严防反革命分子进行破坏。
