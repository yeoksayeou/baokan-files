Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. TASS reports: The Soviet Academy of Sciences' conference on scientific and technological issues concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy opened in Moscow on July 1st. Approximately two thousand scientists, engineers, and technicians from various Soviet republics, as well as scientists from China, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Albania, Japan, Romania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Israel, Hungary, Finland, Sweden, Egypt, and other countries, attended the conference.

    The opening ceremony was presided over by Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He spoke about the tremendous possibilities that atomic energy opens up for human progress. He pointed out that the use of atomic fuel heralds a technological and economic transformation. Under conditions of peaceful coexistence of different social systems and friendship among the peoples of all countries, the development of nuclear energy can enable technologically more developed countries to help technologically less developed countries rapidly improve their power and economy. He then mentioned some steps already taken by the Soviet government in this regard.

    Nesmeyanov said that we are on the eve of a great technological and economic revolution, and we have entered the atomic age. Our task is to do everything possible to promote the widespread and in-depth application of all the potential currently offered by nuclear science and nuclear industry in science, technology, agriculture, and medicine. We firmly believe that we are moving towards unprecedented heights in scientific, technological, and economic development, and we are exploring these aspects to the highest degree, while at the same time we have not forgotten the threat of atomic war. But we are convinced that the will of the people of all countries will inevitably triumph. Soviet scientists and hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world demand the immediate prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and demand that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes, to benefit mankind rather than harm it. We call on scientists all over the world to work together for the benefit of all peoples to devote themselves to the work of peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The first report of the conference was Professor Vlasov, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, on "Research on Uranium-Graphite Reactors by the Soviet Academy of Sciences." He talked about the extensive research on chain reactions in the Soviet Union in recent years, and the first Soviet atomic boiler has already been put into production. Professor Vlasov pointed out that this is also the first atomic boiler in Europe. The establishment and power generation of the world's first atomic power station in the Soviet Union undoubtedly marks a technological revolution and the beginning of a new century—the atomic energy century.

    Subsequently, Academician-Correspondent of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, M. Meshcheryakov, made a report on "Research on Nuclear Change Processes in Accelerators under Conditions of Huge Energy." Academician A. Vinogradov made a report on "Radiochemical Research on Nuclear Transmutation Products under the Impact of Particles Containing Huge Energy."

    Wang Ganchang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference. A congratulatory telegram from the German Academy of Sciences to the conference was also read at the meeting.

    苏联举行讨论和平利用原子能会议
　　苏联和各国的科学家两千人出席会议
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院讨论和平利用原子能的科学和技术问题的会议七月一日在莫斯科开幕。出席会议的有苏联各加盟共和国的科学家、工程师与技师和中国、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚、日本、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、以色列、匈牙利、芬兰、瑞典、埃及和其他国家的科学家共约两千人。
    会议由苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫主持开幕。他谈到了原子能为人类的进步所开辟的巨大可能性。他指出，原子燃料的利用预示着在技术上和经济上的一个变革。在各种社会制度和平共处和各国人民友好的条件下，发展核子能就可以使技术上较发达的国家帮助技术上比较不发达的国家急剧地提高自己的动力和经济。他接着提到了苏联政府在这方面已采取的一些步骤。
    涅斯米扬诺夫说，我们正处在伟大的技术经济革命的前夕，我们已经进入了原子时代。我们的任务是全力促进目前核子科学和核子工业所提供的全部潜能在科学、技术、农业和医学中得到广泛和深入的运用。我们坚信，我们正在走向科学、技术、经济发展的空前高峰，并且正在最高度地发掘这些方面的潜力，而同时我们也没有忘记原子战争威胁。但是我们深信，各国人民的意志必然会胜利。苏联科学家和全世界数以亿计的普通人民同声要求立即禁止原子弹和氢弹，要求将原子能用于和平目的，使它造福人类而不是危害人类。我们号召全世界科学家为了各国人民的利益而同心协力地致力于和平使用原子能的工作。
    会议的第一个报告是物理数学博士弗尔索夫教授的“苏联科学院对铀—石墨反应堆的研究”。他谈到苏联最近几年来广泛研究链锁反应的情况，苏联第一个原子锅炉已经投入生产了。弗尔索夫教授指出，这也是欧洲第一个原子锅炉。世界上第一个原子能发电站在苏联的建立和发电，无疑地标志着技术的革命以及新世纪——原子能世纪的开始。
    接着，苏联科学院通讯院士麦·麦谢里雅科夫作了“在巨大能量情况下加速器中核子变化过程的研究”的报告。亚·维诺格拉多夫院士作了“在含有巨大能量的粒子的冲击情况下，核子蜕变物的放射化学研究”的报告。
    中国科学院物理研究所副所长王淦昌向会议致了贺词。会上还宣读了德国科学院给会议的贺电。
