　　Nationwide Denunciation of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
　　People from All Walks of Life Heighten Vigilance to Resolutely Eliminate All Counter-Revolutionary Elements

　　(Our News) The struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is unfolding more widely and deeply across the country. More and more people from all walks of life are participating in the struggle, and they have unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

　　In Beijing, over 200,000 staff members of municipal-level organizations, factories, mines, and enterprises, as well as teachers and students from schools, participated in thousands of report meetings, symposiums, and discussions while studying the first and second batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. After the publication of the third batch of materials, it aroused even greater anger among the broad masses of people against the counter-revolutionary elements. All units of municipal-level organizations, all twenty-seven universities and colleges in the city, factories, mines, enterprises, basic construction sites, Beijing organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, faculty and staff of primary and secondary schools, literary and art circles, medical circles, rural cadres, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and even street residents, regardless of class, belief, occupation, ethnicity, or gender, have all joined the struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In Jiangsu Province, provincial-level units held forty denunciation rallies in the six days from June 15th to 20th, with the participation of over 14,000 staff members. In Zhejiang Province, over 110,000 staff members of organizations, teachers, and students listened to reports on exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in the three days from June 18th to 20th. In Chongqing, organizations, groups, factories, mines, and schools also held continuous rallies to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique; from June 9th to 19th, according to incomplete statistics, over 80,000 person-times participated in the rallies. In Shenyang, 140,000 staff members of organizations and groups, and intellectuals actively participated in the struggle. Religious figures in various places have also participated in the struggle. Over 900 religious figures in Nanjing, including Catholic priests and nuns, Christian pastors, and Buddhist monks and nuns, held a rally to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

　　The struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has now penetrated small and medium-sized towns and some rural areas across the country. People from all walks of life in Qichun County, Hubei Province, also held a rally to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements. Chen Qinghua and Fang Tanfa, representatives of farmers from Shaolong Township and Xiashitan Township in the Second District of Qichun County, where Hu Feng's family is located, accused Hu Feng at the meeting of consistently supporting and shielding landlord families and attacking farmers before and after liberation. Farmers from Xishan Village (formerly under Ba County) in Huayan Township, Chongqing, accused Hu Feng of sabotaging the land reform movement when he participated in the land reform in Xishan Village in 1951. Liu Yunqing, a farmer who participated in the rural land reform, said at the meeting that when we struggled against the landlords, Hu Feng said, "Farmers are people, and landlords are also people, don't struggle excessively." During the land reform, when the Xishan Village militia captured Duan Sinong, the company commander of the pseudo "Self-Defense and People-Protection Army" special force, Hu Feng used the excuse of "not having grasped any materials" to prevent the masses from struggling against him, and finally released this counter-revolutionary element. The farmers who attended the meeting unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng according to the law. Many village staff members and farmers also expressed that they would learn from the lessons, heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and strictly prevent the enemy from sabotaging agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

　　During this period, people from all over the country have exposed and accused many key members of the Hu Feng clique of carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. Staff members of the cultural departments in Tianjin further exposed the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of Hu Feng clique members A Long, Lu Dian, and Lu Li. Representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou exposed the criminal activities of Hu Feng clique member Zhu Guhuai, who infiltrated Guangzhou No. 5 Middle School as a teacher. Staff members of the Shanghai New Literature Publishing House held meetings for days to expose the counter-revolutionary activities of key members of the Hu Feng clique, such as Liu Xuewei, Mei Lin, Geng Yong, Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao, and Hang Xing. Workers in Hangzhou accused Hu Feng clique member Ji Fang of selling Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary private goods among the workers.

　　After studying, discussing, and participating in various rallies, and listening to reports on denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, people from all walks of life in various places have universally raised their awareness and further recognized that the class struggle in the transition period is becoming more complex and acute. They unanimously expressed their determination to heighten revolutionary vigilance and pay attention to the enemy's sabotage activities at all times. Many staff members of organizations, in connection with their own ideological style, examined the liberalism, individualism, and political carelessness that are easily taken advantage of by hidden enemies.

　　全国广泛声讨胡风反革命集团
　　各界人民提高警惕决肃清一切反革命分子
    本报讯　声讨胡风反革命集团的斗争，在全国各地更加广泛深入地展开。各地各阶层人民越来越多地参加到斗争中来，他们一致表示要坚决、彻底肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    北京市市级机关、厂矿企业的工作人员、工人和学校的教师、学生在学习关于胡风反革命集团的第一、第二两批材料时，就有二十多万人参加了数以千计的报告会、座谈会和讨论会。在第三批材料公布以后，激起了广大人民群众对反革命分子的更大的愤怒。市级机关的一切单位、全市二十七所高等学校、全市厂矿企业、基本建设工地、各民主党派北京市组织、人民团体、中小学校教职员、文艺界、医务界、农村干部、工商界、宗教界，以至街道居民，不分阶层，不分信仰，不分职业，不分民族，不分男女，一致投入声讨胡风反革命集团的斗争。江苏省省级各单位从六月十五日到二十日的六天中就分别举行了声讨大会四十次，参加大会的机关工作人员达一万四千多人。浙江省在六月十八日到二十日的三天中，就有机关工作人员、教员、学生十一万多人听了关于揭露胡风反革命集团罪行的报告。重庆市的机关、团体、厂矿、学校也连续不断地举行声讨胡风反革命集团的集会，六月九日到十九日，据不完全的统计，参加集会的达八万多人次。沈阳市有十四万机关、团体的工作人员和知识分子积极参加了斗争。各地的宗教界人士也都参加了斗争。南京市宗教界人士九百多人，包括天主教神甫、修女，基督教教牧人员和佛教界僧、尼，曾举行声讨胡风反革命集团罪行大会。
    现在声讨胡风反革命集团的斗争已经深入到全国各省的中小城镇和部分农村。湖北省蕲春县各界人民也举行了声讨胡风反革命分子大会，胡风家庭所在的蕲春县第二区邵垅乡和下石潭乡的农民代表陈庆华、方坦发在会上控诉了胡风在解放前后一贯支持包庇地主家庭，向农民进攻的罪行。重庆市华岩乡（原属巴县）西山村的农民控诉胡风一九五一年在西山村参加土地改革时，破坏土地改革运动的罪行。曾经参加过乡村土地改革工作的农民刘云清在会上说，当我们斗争地主时，胡风就说：“农民是人，地主也是人，不要斗争过火了。”在土地改革中，西山村民兵捕获伪“自卫保民军”特种队连长段司农时，胡风以“没有掌握什么材料”为借口，阻止群众去斗争，最后并把这个反革命分子放掉了。参加会议的农民一致要求政府把反革命分子胡风依法严办。许多村工作人员和农民并表示要很好地接受教训，提高警惕，加强团结，严防敌人破坏农业生产和互助合作运动。
    在这个期间，各地人民纷纷揭露和控诉了胡风集团中的许多骨干分子进行反革命活动的罪行。天津市文化部门工作人员进一步深入揭发了胡风集团分子阿垅、芦甸、鲁藜的反革命破坏活动。广州市各界代表揭发钻入广州第五中学作教师的胡风分子朱谷怀的罪恶活动。上海新文艺出版社的工作人员连日开会揭发了胡风集团骨干分子刘雪苇、梅林、耿庸、罗洛、张中晓、杭行等人的反革命活动。杭州市工人控诉了胡风分子冀汸在工人中贩卖胡风反革命私货的罪行。
    各地各阶层人民经过学习、讨论并参加各种集会，听了关于声讨胡风反革命集团和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的报告以后，普遍提高了觉悟，进一步认识了过渡时期阶级斗争越发复杂和尖锐了，一致表示要提高革命警惕，时时刻刻注意敌人的破坏活动。许多机关工作人员在学习中联系自己的思想作风，检查了容易被暗藏敌人所乘的自由主义、个人主义，以及在政治上的麻痹大意。
