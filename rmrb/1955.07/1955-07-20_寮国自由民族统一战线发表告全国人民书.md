Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: The Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a letter to the people of the whole country on July 16th.

The letter to the people calls on all Lao people to consolidate peace, achieve unity, and complete independence and democracy, demanding that the Lao Royal Government agree to the following: 1. Immediately stop the offensive against the Lao fighting forces and withdraw all Royal Army troops that have been reinforced to Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces since March 9th; 2. Sincerely conduct talks with the Lao fighting forces to discuss holding free and democratic general elections with the participation of the Lao fighting forces in order to unify the country under a coalition government; 3. Guarantee all freedoms and democratic rights, and release all arrested patriots.

The letter to the people points out that since the ceasefire, the Lao fighting forces have sincerely implemented the Geneva Accords. At the political conferences between the two sides, the Lao fighting forces have repeatedly expressed their sincerity in negotiating and cooperating with the Lao Royal Government on the principles of mutual respect and mutual concession. However, some elements within the Royal Government, at the instigation of US imperialism, have continuously undermined the political conferences, attempting to prevent the Lao side from participating in the general elections. They are also plotting to carry out terrorist reprisals against former resistance personnel, seize the two provinces where the Lao fighting forces are concentrated, and scheming to eliminate the Lao fighting forces before the general elections.

The letter to the people calls on all Lao people to unite with the Lao fighting forces to expose and thwart the schemes of US imperialism and its loyal running dogs.

    寮国自由民族统一战线发表告全国人民书
    新华社河内十九日电　寮国自由民族统一战线中央执行委员会在七月十六日发表告全国人民书。
    告全国人民书号召全体老挝人民为了巩固和平，实现统一，完成独立和民主，要求老挝王国政府答应下列事项：一、立即停止对寮国战斗部队的进攻，把从三月九日以来增援到丰沙里、桑怒两省的王国军队全部撤出；二、诚恳地同寮国战斗部队进行会谈，讨论举行有寮国战斗部队参加的自由的、民主的普选，以便把全国统一到一个联合政府下；三、保障一切自由、民主权利，释放全部被逮捕的爱国者。
    告全国人民书指出，自从停战以来，寮国战斗部队诚意地执行了日内瓦协定。在双方的政治会议上，寮国战斗部队多次表示了愿意在互相尊重、互相让步的原则上同老挝王国政府协商、合作的诚意。但是，王国政府里面有一些分子在美帝国主义的唆使下，不断地破坏政治会议，企图不让寮国方面参加普选，他们又阴谋对前抗战人员进行恐怖报复，侵占寮国战斗部队集结的两省，并且阴谋在普选前把寮国战斗部队消灭掉。
    告全国人民书中号召老挝全体人民同寮国战斗部队团结在一起，揭露并挫败美帝国主义及其忠实走狗的阴谋。
