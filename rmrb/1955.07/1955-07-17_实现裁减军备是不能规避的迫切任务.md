Achieving Disarmament is an Urgent Task That Cannot Be Avoided
    Wan Guang

In the current struggle to strive for peace and ease international tensions, the issue of disarmament is a fundamental one. The World Peace Assembly held in Helsinki in late June once again raised the urgent demands of broad sections of the public in various countries on this issue. Representatives of the people from sixty-eight countries at the conference unanimously advocated that in order to eliminate the threat of atomic war and relieve the burden of armaments, it is necessary to gradually reduce armaments and destroy all stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Representatives of mothers from sixty-six countries who gathered in Lausanne, Switzerland in early July also unanimously passed a resolution, requesting the heads of government of the four major powers to conduct serious consultations to promote the resolution of this issue and other major international issues. This strong sentiment, which pervades the world, was also reflected at the recent commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter held in San Francisco. Government representatives from various countries who spoke at the commemoration almost unanimously talked about seeking to resolve the issue of disarmament.

At present, it is not only extremely necessary for all countries, especially the major powers, to seek to reach an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, but there are also good opportunities for this. The new proposals on the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars put forward by the Soviet government on May 10 have provided a broad basis for reaching an agreement on this issue. On June 22, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also elaborated on this proposal at the United Nations commemoration in San Francisco.

The great significance of the Soviet Union's new proposal lies in the fact that it proceeds from the current international reality and puts forward a comprehensive, practical, and feasible plan for achieving disarmament, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of war in a realistic manner. The lack of necessary trust between major powers in current international relations is the main obstacle hindering the resolution of outstanding international issues. Therefore, the Soviet proposal first puts forward many specific steps to restore the necessary trust between nations. The proposal also calls for convening a world conference on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons in the first half of 1956, with the participation of member and non-member states of the United Nations. The Chinese people have long expressed their support for this proposal. World public opinion also widely supports it. This proposal is entirely a manifestation of the Soviet Union's sincerity. If Western countries can also show the same sincerity, then nothing will prevent the Four Power Conference from reaching an effective agreement on the issue of disarmament, thereby promoting mutual trust among the major powers.

The great significance of the Soviet proposal also lies in the fact that it implements the spirit of coordination and eliminates the differences in the specific plans for reducing conventional armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons in the past. Western countries have always used the excuse that the Soviet Union, China, and other countries have an advantage in conventional armaments to reject the Soviet Union's proposal for proportional and universal disarmament and to resist discussions on proposals to prohibit atomic weapons. Now that the new plan put forward by the Soviet Union has adopted the opinions put forward by Western countries in the process of discussing this issue in the reduction of conventional armaments, Western countries can no longer use this excuse to delay disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Western countries have also repeatedly insisted that the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic weapons would cause Western countries to lose their weapons to deal with aggression and opposed this proposal. Now the Soviet Union advocates that before completely prohibiting such weapons, countries have the right to use them to defend against aggression, but the Soviet Union advocates that in this special situation, a unanimous decision should be made by the United Nations Security Council. This takes into account the opinions of Western countries and prevents any country from using the name of defending against aggression to use this weapon. The Soviet Union also reiterated its position: all countries must undertake the obligation not to use atomic weapons. The Soviet proposal has cleared the way for countries to reach an agreement and quickly enter into concrete actions on the issue of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, which has a decisive effect on consolidating world peace, eliminating the threat of war, and reducing the burden on the people. This is a major contribution to the cause of peace. It is precisely because of this that it has been warmly welcomed and supported by peace-loving countries and peoples.

Now, the urgent task of resolving the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is placed before the governments of Western countries. The question is whether the United States and other Western countries will show their sincerity.

In this regard, it is noted that French and British government officials have recently stated that the Four Power Summit should discuss the issue of disarmament and find solutions. U.S. President Eisenhower also said at a press conference on July 6 that some way should be sought to reduce the danger.

It is appropriate for responsible parties in Western countries to make such statements. However, although the Soviet Union's May 10 proposal has been put forward for more than two months, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have not yet expressed their willingness to discuss the Soviet proposal. The Soviet proposal was put forward in the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, but the U.S. representative, with the support of the British and French representatives, suspended the work of the subcommittee indefinitely, evading discussion of the Soviet proposal. The U.S. representative had then used the excuse that the Four Power Summit was about to be held as a pretext for suspending the work of the subcommittee. Eisenhower, however, stated at a press conference on June 29 that the United States did not intend to propose any specific plans on disarmament during the Four Power Conference. The situation has become like this: the United States refuses to discuss the Soviet plan and does not put forward any practical plans of its own.

It should be pointed out that some influential figures in the United States are making every effort to find ways to continue to resist the Soviet proposal and obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue. Some U.S. government officials and newspapers have recently been spreading the argument that "nuclear production has reached such a stage that in fact no supervision would be effective." Therefore, according to these "Cold War" propagandists, the United States should continue to "rely on force" and "threats," and "stand aside" from seeking to reach a disarmament agreement. In fact, this argument is completely untenable. In the current international situation, it is a difficult task to establish effective international supervision of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, but it is not an impossible task. As long as there is sincerity in solving the problem and willingness to take measures to promote international trust, such international supervision can be established. And even in the current situation, as stipulated in the Soviet Union's May 10 proposal, it is possible to establish effective international supervision sufficient to prevent one country from suddenly attacking another country. The fallacy of so-called ineffective supervision is actually to conceal the intention of those who create this argument that they are unwilling to disarm and prohibit atomic weapons.

At the same time, it is noted that some people are carrying out another plan to obstruct the discussion of the issue of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. They insist that it is difficult to solve such broad issues as proposed in the Soviet proposal, and they attempt to narrow the entire issue down to the so-called "limitation of European armaments" issue. From news in American and Western European newspapers, it can be seen that the essence of this so-called "limitation of European armaments" is to limit the armaments of the Soviet Union and European People's Democratic countries, while not stopping West Germany's rearmament, and the United States itself can continue to expand its armaments and accumulate atomic weapons without restriction. Obviously, this is just asking others to give up their weapons of self-defense to be beaten.

"U.S. News & World Report" magazine recently openly stated that the U.S. attitude is, "U.S. bases overseas will not be abandoned," "U.S. troops will not withdraw from Europe in the foreseeable future," "Atomic weapons will not be abandoned." These are also the main points of some statements recently made by U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Commander U.S. General Gruenther, and U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss.

This shows that influential groups in the United States are not interested in disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. What they intend to do is to continue to pursue a "policy of strength" in preparation for a new war, and to maintain and deepen international tensions.

However, this plan runs counter to the wishes of the people of all countries. It must be seen that the will of the people of all countries in the world to eliminate the threat of new wars and to lift the burden of military preparations is stronger than ever before. The pressure of world public opinion has sharply raised the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons on the international agenda, and it is impossible to avoid the condemnation of the people of all countries by using empty talk to deflect this issue. The people will not allow the continued avoidance of the urgent task of achieving disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

U.S. President Eisenhower said at the United Nations commemoration in San Francisco on June 20 that the United States "will work with other nations so that peace and reasonable negotiations can replace the slaughter on the battlefield. In this way, we can in time make huge armaments unnecessary." Now, the Four Power Summit will prove whether these remarks by the United States will be followed by actual actions.

    实现裁减军备是不能规避的迫切任务
    万光
    在当前争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中，裁军问题是一个根本问题。六月下旬在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会，又一次提出了各国广泛阶层公众在这个问题上的迫切要求。六十八个国家人民的代表在这个会议上一致主张：为了消除原子战争威胁和解除军备负担，必须逐步裁减军备，销毁核子武器的一切储存。七月上旬在瑞士洛桑集会的六十六个国家的母亲的代表们也一致通过决议，要求四大国政府首脑进行认真的协商，促使这个问题和其他国际重大问题的解决。遍及全世界的这种强烈的情绪，在最近在旧金山举行的联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会上也得到了反映。在纪念会上发言的各国政府代表几乎一致地都谈到要谋求解决裁军问题。
    在目前，各国，首先是各大国谋求在裁军和禁止原子武器问题上达成协议，不仅是十分必要，而且也是有着良好的机会的。五月十日苏联政府提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的新建议，已为在这个问题上达成协议提供了广泛的基础。六月二十二日，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在旧金山联合国纪念会上又阐述了这个建议。
    苏联新建议的巨大意义在于，它从当前国际的现实情况出发，实事求是地提出了实现裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除战争威胁的全面的、切实可行的方案。目前国际关系中，各大国间缺乏必要的信任，这是阻碍着悬而未决的国际问题得到解决的主要障碍。因此，苏联的建议首先提出了恢复国际间必要信任的许多具体步骤。这个建议还提出要在一九五六年上半年召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的世界裁减军备和禁止原子武器的会议。中国人民早就表示支持这个建议。世界舆论也广泛赞成它。这个建议完全是苏联的诚意的表现。如果西方国家也能表现同样的诚意，就再没有什么东西会妨碍四大国会议就裁军问题达成有效的协议，从而促进大国间相互的信任。
    苏联建议的巨大意义还在于，它贯彻了协调的精神，消除了过去在裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器的具体方案上的分歧。西方国家一直以苏联、中国等国家在常规军备上占有优势为借口拒绝苏联提出的按比例普遍裁军的方案，并抵制关于禁止原子武器的建议的讨论。现在苏联提出的新方案在裁减常规军备方面采取了西方国家在讨论这个问题过程中所提出的意见，西方国家就不能够再用这种借口来拖延裁减军备和禁止原子武器了。西方国家也曾经一再硬说苏联的禁止原子武器的建议是要使西方国家失去对付侵略的武器而反对这个建议，现在苏联主张在完全禁止这种武器之前各国有用它来防御侵略的权利，但苏联主张在这种特殊情况下，应由联合国安全理事会作出一致的决定。这样既考虑到了西方国家的意见，又防止了任何国家假造防御侵略的名义而使用这种武器。苏联并重申它的主张：各国必须承担义务不使用原子武器。苏联的建议已经为各国就普遍裁军和禁止原子武器这个对巩固世界和平和消除战争威胁同时减轻人民负担具有决定性作用的问题达成协议并迅速进入具体行动扫清了道路，这对和平事业是一个重大的贡献。正是因为如此，所以它受到爱好和平国家和人民的热烈欢迎和支持。
    现在，解决裁军和禁止原子武器问题这个迫切任务摆在西方国家政府的面前。问题是要由美国和其他西方国家来表明它们的诚意了。
    在这方面，人们注意到，法国和英国政府人士最近表示四国政府首脑会议应该讨论裁军问题，并找出解决办法。美国总统艾森豪威尔七月六日在记者招待会上也说，应该寻求某种办法来减少危险。
    西方国家负责方面作出这种表示是应该的。但是，虽然苏联五月十日的建议提出来已有两个多月，而美、英、法三国政府至今仍然没有表示准备讨论苏联建议。苏联建议是在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出的，然而美国代表却在英国和法国代表支持下，无限期地中断了小组委员会的工作，规避讨论苏联建议。美国代表当时曾经以将要举行四国政府首脑会议，作为中断小组委员会工作的借口。艾森豪威尔六月二十九日在记者招待会上却表示，美国不打算在四国会议期间提出裁军方面的任何具体计划。情况就成为这样：美国既拒绝讨论苏联的方案，自己又不提出任何切实可行的方案。
    应当指出，美国的一些有势力的人物，正在竭力找寻各种办法来继续抵制苏联建议，阻挠裁军问题的解决。美国一些政府官员和报纸最近正在大量散布着这样一种论调：“核子生产已经达到这样一个阶段，事实上任何监督都不会有效”，因此，按照这些“冷战”鼓吹者的意见，美国应继续“凭借武力”和“威胁”，而对谋求达成裁军协议“站开不管”。实际上，这种论调是根本站不住脚的。在目前国际局势中，要对裁军和禁止原子武器建立有效的国际监督是一件有困难的事情，但是并不是一件不可能做到的事情。只要有解决问题的诚意，愿意采取措施来促进国际间的信任，就能够建立这样的国际监督。而且即使在目前情况下，像苏联五月十日的建议中所规定的，也是可能建立一种足以防止一个国家对另一个国家进行突然攻击的有效的国际监督的。所谓监督无效的谬论，实际是要掩饰制造这种论调者不愿裁军和禁止原子武器的居心。
    同时，人们注意到正有人在进行着阻挠讨论普遍裁军和禁止原子武器问题的另一种策划。他们硬说很难解决苏联建议中提出的这样广泛的问题，他们企图把整个问题缩小为所谓“限制欧洲军备”问题。从美国和西欧报纸消息中可以看到，这种所谓“限制欧洲军备”的实质就是要限制苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的军备，同时却不停止西德重新武装，而且美国自己可以不受限制地继续扩充军备、积蓄原子武器。显然，这只是要别人放弃自卫的武器来挨打。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近公开说，美国的态度是，“美国在海外的基地将不会放弃”，
  “美国军队将不会在可以预见得到的将来撤出欧洲”，“原子武器将不放弃”。这些也就是美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、北大西洋集团军队总司令美国将军格仑瑟、美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯等人最近发表的一些言论的要点。
    这说明，美国有势力的集团对裁军和禁止原子武器是不感兴趣的，他们打算的是继续奉行准备新战争的“实力政策”，保持和加深国际紧张局势。
    但是，这种打算是同各国人民的愿望背道而驰的。必须看到，现在世界各国人民要求消除新战争威胁、要求解除军事准备重担的意志比过去任何时候都更为坚强。世界舆论的压力已经把裁军和禁止原子武器问题尖锐地提到国际议事日程上，要想用空谈来挡开这个问题，那是躲不过各国人民的谴责的。人民不容许继续规避实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器这个迫切的任务。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔六月二十日在旧金山联合国纪念会上曾经说，美国“将同其他国家一起努力以便可以使和平和讲道理的谈判来替代战场上的厮杀。这样我们就可以及时使庞大的军备成为不必要。”现在，四国政府首脑会议就将证明美国的这些言论是否将继之以实际行动了。
