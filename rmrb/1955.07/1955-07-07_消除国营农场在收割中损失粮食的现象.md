　　Eliminate the Phenomenon of Grain Loss During Harvesting on State Farms
　　Ding Luxu
    The wheat harvesting season is approaching in the Northeast region. In the past, some state farms often lost a lot of grain during the harvest due to carelessness and negligence in their work. We should strictly prevent this phenomenon from recurring in the future.

    In the past, the loss of grain during the harvest season in state farms in the Northeast was very serious. During the wheat harvest, many farms one-sidedly emphasized harvesting speed and ignored harvesting quality. Many combine harvesters cut the stalks too high or performed rapid operations inappropriately; therefore, many ears of wheat were cut off halfway, and the number of wheat grains that were not threshed cleanly and blown away was countless. According to a survey of several larger farms such as Jiusan, Tongbei, and Hongxing, the harvesting loss per hectare was more than 50 kilograms. The actual loss was even greater than the surveyed figures, as evidenced by the large number of wheat seedlings that grew in the fields after the wheat harvest. During the autumn harvest, many farms left soybean pods and scattered grains all over the soybean fields after harvesting, and there were even half-cut soybean stalks. In 1954, some soybean fields in Tongbei Farm had a harvesting loss of more than 200 kilograms per hectare. A large amount of beans were left on the drying ground of Yong'an Farm, which was not completely cleaned up until this spring, but many had already gone bad. In the paddy fields after the harvest of Zhaheyang Farm, each person could pick up more than 100 kilograms of rice a day.

    Why is such loss and waste caused? One of the main reasons is that some staff and workers feel that "it is very good to hand over 10,000 tons of grain to the state every year," but they do not see the problems existing in their work and cannot overcome their shortcomings in time. Most of the employees of state farms always believe that "state farms have fewer people, larger plots, and more grain, and harvesting losses are unavoidable." Is harvesting loss really unavoidable? Facts have proved that this is not the case. Last year, the combine operator of No. 138 automatic combine harvester at Baoquanling Farm paid special attention to reducing harvesting losses during the wheat harvest and continuously adjusted the machine carefully, so that the average harvesting loss per hectare was reduced to 3.64 kilograms. Many people always oppose the quality and efficiency of harvesting. They believe that emphasizing quality will inevitably affect efficiency. In fact, what affects harvesting efficiency is machine failure and poor organization and management, not that improving work quality will necessarily reduce harvesting efficiency. Taking the No. 138 combine harvester of Baoquanling Farm as an example, the workload it completed during the wheat harvest exceeded the average workload completed by the entire farm by 48.6 percent.

    Some people also think that "it doesn't matter if a little bit is lost," which is even more wrong. The wheat sowing area of ​​farms in Heilongjiang Province is nearly 50,000 hectares; if the harvesting loss is 1%, the country will lose more than 600 tons of wheat. Shouldn't this attract serious attention?

    Another important aspect of grain loss during the harvest season is the poor management of grain, especially the poor management of seeds, which greatly reduces the germination rate. During the wheat harvest at Baoquanling Farm in 1954, the high-quality wheat seeds were harvested too early, damaging the grains, and there were also problems in the management of the wheat drying ground, which reduced the germination rate of most of the improved varieties to about 70%. Later, such seeds were not carefully selected (broken and fragmented grains were not selected), and the cleaning rate was reduced to 92%, resulting in a utilization rate of only 60%. That is to say, more than 30 kilograms out of 100 kilograms of this kind of wheat seeds were thrown into the ground in vain. This one item alone cost nearly 100 tons of grain. The loss of wheat seeds at Hongxing Farm was also very serious. The germination rate was reduced to about 70%, resulting in a loss of about 50 to 60 tons of wheat seeds. In addition, many farms forgot to bring the harvested grain bags to the wheat drying ground in time or did not turn them over in time, resulting in moldy grain, some of which amounted to thousands of kilograms, and some to tens of thousands of kilograms.

    The serious problem is that some people have not only failed to take positive measures to eliminate this phenomenon of grain loss, but instead believe that "farms are large and there is a lot of grain, which is really difficult to manage." In fact, this is not the case. More than 1,000 tons of wheat seeds from Jiusan Farm have a germination rate of over 90%, because they carefully selected the seeds twice, so that the cleaning rate reached 98% and 99%. Facts have proved that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and can mobilize all employees to fight to eliminate the phenomenon of grain loss, the grain of state farms can definitely be managed well.

    The employees of state farms should realize that: During the period of socialist construction in the motherland, it is of great political significance to strive to increase grain production, eliminate loss and waste, and hand over more grain to the state to support socialist construction. In the harvest season, learn from past lessons and strive to fight for increasing grain production and eliminating loss and waste!

### 消除国营农场在收割中损失粮食的现象

　　消除国营农场在收割中损失粮食的现象
　　丁履枢
    东北地区收获小麦的季节到了。过去，有些国营农场在收获过程中往往因工作上的粗枝大叶和漫不经心而损失了大量的粮食。今后应严格防止这种现象重新出现。
    过去东北地区国营农场在收获季节损失粮食的情况是十分严重的。在麦收中，许多农场片面强调收割速度，忽视收割质量。很多联合收割机在麦收中高茬收割，或不适当地实行快速作业；因此，不少麦穗被剪掉半截，脱粒不净和吹掉的麦粒更是难以计数。据调查，九三、通北、红星等几个较大的农场，每公顷收割损失都在五十公斤以上。实际的损失比调查的数字还要多，这从麦收后地里长出的麦苗之多就足以证明。在秋季收获作业中，许多农场在收割后的大豆地上，剩下的豆荚和撒掉的豆粒到处都是，甚至还有半截半截的豆棵。一九五四年通北农场有些大豆地每公顷的收割损失达二百多公斤。永安农场的晒场上遗留了大量的豆子，今年春天才彻底清理，但已坏了不少，查哈阳农场收割后的稻田上，每人一天能拣稻谷一百多公斤。
    为什么会造成这样的损失浪费呢？主要原因之一是，有些工作人员和工人觉得“年年上缴给国家万吨粮食”就很不错了，而看不到工作中存在的问题，不能及时克服缺点。大多数国营农场的职工，总认为“国营农场的人数少，地块大，粮食多，收割损失是不可避免的”。收割损失真的不可避免吗？事实证明，并不是这样的。去年宝泉岭农场一三八号自动联合收割机的联合机手，在麦收中特别注意到减少收割损失的问题，不断地认真调整机器，使收割损失平均每公顷降低到三点六四公斤。许多人总是把收割的质量和效率对立起来，他们认为要强调质量，就必然会影响效率。事实上影响收割效率的是机器故障，是组织管理不善，并不是改进工作质量就一定会降低收割效率。就以宝泉岭农场一三八号联合收割机来看，它在麦收中完成的工作量，比全场平均完成的工作量超过了百分之四十八点六。
    还有些人认为“损失一星半点没啥”，这更是错误的。黑龙江省境内各农场的小麦播种面积近五万公顷；如果收割损失百分之一，就使国家损失了六百多吨小麦。难道这还不应当引起严重的注意吗？
    在收获季节里损失粮食的另一个重要方面，就是对于粮食管理的不善，特别是对于种子管理不好，大大降低了发芽率。一九五四年宝泉岭农场麦收时，优良的小麦种子收割过早，把麦粒打伤，又加以晒麦场管理上也有问题，使大部分良种的发芽率降低到百分之七十左右。这样的种子后来又未认真精选（破半碎粒未能选出），清洁率又降低到百分之九十二，结果利用率仅为百分之六十几。这就是说，这种小麦种子，一百公斤就有三十多公斤白白地扔到地里去。仅仅这一项，就损失了近百吨粮食。红星农场的麦种损失也很严重。发芽率降低到百分之七十几，约损失五、六十吨小麦种子。此外，不少农场，因为把收获后的粮袋忘在田间没有及时拉到晒麦场或者翻晒不及时而霉坏的粮食，有的是数千斤，有的达数万斤。
    严重的问题是有些人对于这种损失粮食的现象，不仅未能采取积极的办法加以消灭，反而认为“农场大，粮食多，实在难以管理”。事实上并不是如此。九三农场的小麦种子千多吨，大部分的发芽率在百分之九十以上，就是由于他们把种子认真精选了两遍，使清洁率达到百分之九十八、九十九。事实证明，只要领导方面重视，并能发动全体职工一致为了消灭损失粮食的现象而斗争，国营农场的粮食，一定能管理好。
    国营农场的职工们应当认识到：在祖国社会主义建设时期，努力增产粮食，消灭损失浪费，交给国家更多的粮食，以支援社会主义建设，是具有重大的政治意义的。在收获的季节里，接受以往的教训，努力为增产粮食、消灭损失浪费而斗争吧！
