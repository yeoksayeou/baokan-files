    How Investment of Over 54 Million Yuan Was Saved

    The First Ministry of Machine Building recently revised the product plan for the reconstruction of the 8101 and 8102 locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories. After the revision, the product variety and quantity remained unchanged, but it could save the country 54,466,800 yuan in investment.
    Why could so much investment be saved for the country just by modifying the product plan, while the product variety and quantity remained unchanged?
    Originally, both of these locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories had workshops for producing locomotives and freight cars, but neither factory alone could produce locomotives or freight cars to meet the needs of the country. Therefore, the initially formulated product plan distributed the task of producing locomotives and freight cars to the two locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories. At that time, the design unit only considered how to produce to meet the needs of the country, and did not consider how to produce to both meet the needs of the country and save construction funds.
    This spring, after Soviet experts helped the design unit review the product plans of these two factories respectively, they discovered the following problems: The locomotive assembly workshop of the 8101 locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factory still had great potential in terms of workshop area and crane lifting capacity, and the load rate of the machine tools was also very low. For example, the standard load rate of general machine tools should reach about 80%, while the machine tool load rate of the machining workshop of the 8101 factory only reached 75%, and the machine tool load rate of the mechanical processing part of the coal water car only reached 61%. According to the original product plan, this factory would need to demolish a large part of the building area to add a large part of the building area for producing freight cars, and the ability to produce locomotives would never be fully utilized.
    On the other hand, the equipment foundation of the 8102 locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factory for producing locomotives was originally very weak. If it were to produce locomotives according to the original product plan, it would have to spend a lot of money to renovate the original factory to increase the construction and equipment for producing locomotives.
    After detailed calculations by Soviet experts and design personnel, it was proved that it was technically completely possible for the 8101 locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factory to concentrate on producing locomotives, and the 8102 locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factory to concentrate on producing freight cars. As a result, the equipment potential of the 8101 factory to produce locomotives can be fully utilized, and the 8102 factory can also reduce the equipment renovation for producing locomotives, which is very reasonable from an economic point of view. For example, after the locomotives are centrally produced by the Dalian factory, the machine tool load rate of the locomotive machining workshop of the 8101 factory will increase from the original 75% to 82%; although the output of locomotives has increased by 80%, the machine tool equipment only needs to increase by 45%. For another example, the machine tool load rate of the mechanical processing part of the coal water car can be increased from the original 61% to 79%, so the machine tool only needs to increase by 22.7%.
    Since the number of machine tools that need to be increased has been reduced, the area of ​​factory buildings that need to be demolished and added has been reduced, and the power equipment and management costs required by the machine tools have also been reduced accordingly. This not only reduced basic construction investment, but also reduced product costs. For example, according to the original product plan, the cost of each locomotive produced in the 8101 factory was 133,051 yuan; the cost of each locomotive produced in the 8102 factory was 135,500 yuan, but now it is concentrated in the 8101 factory, and each locomotive only costs more than 123,900 yuan. According to the original product plan, the cost of each gondola (a type of freight car) produced in the 8101 factory was 16,147 yuan, and the cost of each gondola produced in the 8102 factory was 16,400 yuan, but if they are centrally produced by the 8102 factory, each only costs 16,010 yuan.
    After adopting the new product plan, not only can more than 50 million yuan of construction investment be saved, but also several million yuan of costs can be saved for the country every year when producing locomotives and freight cars. Facts have proved that when formulating product plans, it is necessary to conduct repeated economic analysis and comparison in the spirit of practicing thrift to avoid waste.

    五千四百多万元的投资是怎样节省下来的
    叶克明
    第一机械工业部最近修改了改建八一○一和八一○二两个机车车辆制造工厂的产品方案。修改后，产品品种、数量不变，却可为国家节约五千四百六十六万八千元的投资。
    为什么只修改了产品方案，产品品种、数量不变，就可为国家节约这么多的投资呢？
    原来这两个机车车辆制造工厂都有生产机车和货车的工场，但是单独让哪一个厂生产机车或货车都不能满足国家需要。因此，最初制定的产品方案，将生产机车和货车的任务分担在两个机车车辆制造厂身上。当时，设计单位只考虑怎样生产才能满足国家需要，而没有考虑怎样生产才能既满足了国家需要又能节省建设资金。
    今年春天，苏联专家帮助设计单位分别审查了这两个厂的产品方案以后，就发现了如下的问题：八一○一机车车辆制造工厂的机车装配车间，无论从车间面积上来看或从吊车起重能力上来看，都还有很大的潜力，而机床的负荷率也很低。如按一般机床的标准负荷率应该达到百分之八十左右，而八一○一厂机械加工车间机床负荷率只达百分之七十五，煤水车机械加工部分的机床负荷率只达百分之六十一。如按原来的产品方案，这个厂就需要拆除很大一部分的建筑面积来增建很大一部分生产货车的建筑面积，而生产机车的能力永远得不到充分发挥。
    另一方面，八一○二机车车辆制造工厂生产机车部分的设备基础本来就很薄弱，如果要按原来产品方案生产机车，还要花很多钱进行对原工厂的改建，以增加生产机车的建筑和设备。
    经过苏联专家帮助设计人员详细计算，证明八一○一机车车辆制造工厂集中生产机车，八一○二机车车辆制造工厂集中生产货车，这在技术条件上是完全可能的。这样做的结果，八一○一厂生产机车的设备潜力可以充分发挥，八一○二厂也可以减少改建生产机车的设备，从经济效果上看这是非常合理的。如机车集中由大连厂生产后，八一○一厂机车机械加工车间机床负荷率就由原来的百分之七十五提高到百分之八十二；机车的产量虽增加了百分之八十，但机床设备只要增加百分之四十五就够了。再如煤水车机械加工部分机床负荷率就由原来只能达到百分之六十一提高到百分之七十九，因此机床只需要增加百分之二十二点七就够了。
    由于需要增加的机床台数减少了，需要拆除和增建的厂房面积减少了，使机床所需要的电力设备和管理费用等也都相应地减少了。这样，不仅减少了基本建设投资，而且降低了产品成本。如机车的成本，按原产品方案在八一○一厂生产，每台是十三万三千零五十一元；在八一○二厂生产，每台是十三万五千五百元，而现在集中在八一○一厂生产，每台只要十二万三千九百多元。棚车（货车的一种）的成本，按原产品方案，在八一○一厂生产每台是一万六千一百四十七元，在八一○二厂生产每台是一万六千四百元，集中由八一○二厂生产每台只要一万六千零十元。
    采用新产品方案后，不但节省了五千多万元建设投资，而且每年生产机车、货车时，还可为国家节约数百万元的成本。事实证明，制定产品方案时，必须本着厉行节约的精神，进行反复的经济分析和比较，以免造成浪费。
