Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued an emergency notice on strengthening current pest control work.

    The notice states: Since the beginning of summer, the average temperature in most areas north of the Huai River and Qinling Mountains, as well as the Pearl River, Taihu Lake, and Wei River basins, has been higher than in previous years, which is extremely conducive to the breeding and reproduction of pests. Currently, armyworms have infested and damaged many areas, red spider mites and cotton bollworms are rapidly developing and causing damage in cotton-growing areas, and rice pest infestations are also relatively severe in rice-growing areas. In locust-affected areas, special attention should be paid to the egg-laying of summer locusts and the occurrence of autumn locusts. It is expected that July and August will be a period of severe infestation by various pests and diseases, and even the slightest negligence will cause significant losses. Therefore, effectively carrying out pest control work has become a key to ensuring a good autumn harvest and increased production.

    The notice puts forward the following points, requiring agricultural departments at all levels to immediately study and implement them. 1. Agricultural departments at all levels should list pest control work as one of the central contents of leading agricultural production at present, make serious deployments and inspections, quickly mobilize the masses to take action, and correct the tendency in some areas where pests occur but no one cares, with the higher authorities being anxious while the lower levels are inactive. Agricultural technology extension stations at all levels should effectively organize the masses to do a good job in pest control in their respective areas. 2. Clarify the pest situation and have a clear understanding of it. The masses should be widely mobilized to carry out field inspections, give full play to the role of existing forecasting stations and information points, strengthen the reporting system, carefully study and analyze the pest situation, and issue timely forecasts. 3. The development of pest control work should focus on state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives. In order to enable agricultural production cooperatives to play a demonstrative leading role, first of all, assistance should be given to agricultural production cooperatives in doing a good job in pest control work evaluation and work point recording, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members in pest control, and the principle of equal pay for equal work should be earnestly implemented to encourage women to participate in pest control in order to solve the labor shortage in pest control and other agricultural activities. 4. The supply of agricultural and agricultural machinery this year is generally sufficient, and there are still large amounts of stockpiles in most areas. Supply and marketing cooperatives should be assisted in allocating medicines and machinery according to the development of pests and the foundation of prevention and control, and vigorous publicity and education work should be carried out on the use and storage of related medicines and machinery. Since many areas suffered from flooding last year and the wheat harvest was not good in some areas this year, loans should be issued in a timely manner in cooperation with banks to farmers who have difficulties in pest control.

    农业部发出加强当前治虫工作的紧急通知
    新华社二十八日讯　农业部最近发出关于加强当前治虫工作的紧急通知。
    通知中说：入夏以来，淮河秦岭以北大部地区，珠江、太湖、渭河流域平均气温皆高于往年，极有利于害虫的滋生繁殖。目前粘虫已在不少地区发生为害，棉区红蜘蛛、棉铃虫迅速发展和为害，水稻地区稻虫发生情况也较严重。蝗区应特别注意夏蝗产卵和秋蝗的发生。预计七、八月份将是多种病虫严重为害时期，稍一疏忽，即将造成重大的损失。因此，切实开展治虫工作已成为当前保秋增产的关键。
    通知中提出下列各点，要求各级农业部门立即研究贯彻执行。一、各级农业部门应将治虫工作列为当前领导农业生产的中心内容之一，认真地部署，检查，迅速发动群众，投入行动，纠正部分地区虫子发生，无人过问，上面着急，下边不动的偏向。各农业技术推广站应切实组织群众，做好本区的治虫工作。二、澄清虫情，做到心中有数。应广泛发动群众开展田间检查，充分发挥现有预测站、情报点的作用，加强汇报制度，认真研究分析虫情，及时发出预报。三、治虫工作的开展应以国营农场、农业生产合作社为中心。为使农业生产合作社发挥示范带头作用，首先应协助农业生产合作社做好治虫的评工记分工作，以刺激社员的治虫积极性，并切实贯彻同工同酬的原则，鼓励妇女参加治虫，以解决治虫与其他农事活动的劳力不足。四、今年农业、农械的供应数量一般是充裕的，目前大部地区积存尚多。应根据虫害发展和防治基础，协助供销合作社做好药械调拨，并大力进行有关药械使用、保管的宣传教育工作。由于去年不少地区遭受水淹，今年部分地区麦收不好，对于治虫有困难的农户应配合银行及时发放贷款。
