Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 3rd: The "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 3rd, commenting on the achievements of the World Peace Conference, saying: The World Peace Conference has further widely and consolidated the unity of all peace forces, demonstrating the growth and strengthening of this invincible force.
The editorial said: "The Korean people are satisfied with and welcome the position taken by the Helsinki Conference on the Korean issue. The Korean people believe that the final resolution of the Korean issue cannot be delayed any longer, and they firmly demand the early convening of a political conference with the participation of relevant countries to resolve the Korean issue."
The editorial concluded: "The great achievements of the Helsinki Conference have further powerfully encouraged the people of the world—including the Korean people—in their struggle to eliminate the threat of a new war and consolidate peace."
"Democratic Korea" also published an editorial on the 3rd, saying: The Korean people actively support and welcome the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Conference and are determined to continue to fight to further strengthen the friendship and unity with peace-loving people, ease tensions in the Far East, consolidate world peace, and accomplish the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 2nd: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on July 1st on the World Peace Conference, entitled "The People of All Countries Call for Peace." The editorial pointed out that many events in recent months have shown that the possibility of easing international tensions and resolving outstanding international issues through negotiation exists, and that efforts should now be made in this regard, which largely depends on the efforts of public opinion in various countries.
The editorial pointed out that the aggressive forces have not abandoned their attempts to undermine the summit meeting of the four major powers, which requires public opinion in all countries to exert influence on those ruling groups that disregard the will of the people.
The editorial said that the World Peace Conference has a very wide representation. Although the representatives attending the conference with different political views and religious beliefs have different opinions on many issues, they have reached a complete consensus on major issues, which is a very valuable contribution.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 2nd: Prague newspapers on the 1st wrote articles welcoming the achievements of the Helsinki World Peace Conference. "Agricultural News" said that the achievements of the conference will have a significant and beneficial impact on the further struggle for the cause of peace and international friendship. The newspaper pointed out that the conference showed that despite differences in opinion, a genuine desire for peace is the main and decisive factor in reaching agreements on major international issues.
"People's Defense News" emphasized: The Five Principles advocated by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai have once again received great moral support from this most powerful international movement.
"Labor News" wrote: The wide representation of the Helsinki Conference shows how the peace front is expanding. The newspaper said that the conference showed that the whole world condemns the United States' occupation of Taiwan, and the whole world demands that China should obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations.
