Capital design and construction units, along with many design units in the Southwest and Northwest, are negotiating with construction units to reduce the cost of non-productive building projects in the spirit of comprehensive economization. Everyone is re-examining and revising the designs of over 1.5 million square meters of building projects that have already started construction. For projects that are currently being designed, they have all decided to reduce the cost to within the new standards.

The Urban Design Institute, based on the principles of suitability, economy, and aesthetic considerations where possible, and on the premise that the structure is not significantly changed and construction is not delayed, has modified the designs of seven projects, which can save a total of more than 1.41 million yuan, accounting for 17.4% of the original cost. For example, for the office building and auditorium project of a certain college, the height of each floor of the office building was appropriately reduced, the artificial stone was changed to washed stone, the architrave and floral decorations were changed to exposed brick walls, and the wooden floor was changed to cement plaster. At the same time, some unnecessary equipment in the auditorium was eliminated, which can save more than 440,000 yuan.

The original plan for the office building of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with a construction area of 30,000 square meters, was modified by reducing the height of each floor, etc., so that the cost per square meter was reduced to within the new standard. The office building project of more than 12,000 square meters, jointly constructed by the ministries and commissions of the State Council, can reduce the cost by more than 70 yuan per square meter after the design is modified. The dormitory building with 23,000 square meters also reduced the cost by more than 40 yuan per square meter.

Xinhua News Agency - The Southwest Engineering Management Bureau, the Southwest Industrial Building Design Institute, the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau, and the Chongqing Coal Mine Design Institute have revised their designs in accordance with the spirit of comprehensive economization, saving the country more than 8.4 million yuan. In reducing the standards of non-productive buildings, the Southwest Engineering Management Bureau saved 2.63 million yuan just by modifying the designs of 67 projects. The high-rise dormitory originally planned to be built by the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau has now been changed to single-story buildings. The structures of the buildings with excessively high standards have all been changed. The cost per square meter of the dormitory has been reduced from 55 yuan to 20 yuan. The costs of other productive construction projects have also been appropriately adjusted. The Chongqing Coal Mine Design Institute saved 2.38 million yuan by reducing four projects such as the transmission line of Nantong Coal Mine and modifying other designs.

Xinhua News Agency - The Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute is launching a comprehensive economization campaign. They have already modified the designs of four types of dormitories, which can save the country more than 1 million yuan. They have proposed a variety of modification plans for non-productive buildings to be constructed after July, and the cost of construction can be reduced by more than 50% compared with the past.

These plans eliminate the large roofs, ridges, drooping ridges, and ridge kisses that blindly pursue architectural forms and cause waste, reduce the balconies with complex patterns on the facades for decoration, and eliminate wardrobes, double-layer windows, and other items that blindly increase project standards. At the same time, the cement floor is changed to a brick floor, and the height of the houses is appropriately reduced.

In the process of studying these plans, many designers adopted a proactive and responsible attitude. In order to reduce project costs, Chief Engineer Xue Shengzu sometimes studied until after 2:00 a.m. Liu Dahai, Nie Qijun, Dong Shiying, and others voluntarily gave up their rest time to rush to revise the design drawings. Many designers also went to the construction sites of key project dormitory areas in Xi'an and Lanzhou to fully exchange opinions with the responsible persons of the construction and construction units based on the construction progress and material preparation, and to determine the modification plan.

After they read Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report "Practice Economy and Strive to Complete Socialist Construction," they were greatly inspired. Now they are studying this report, combining it with the criticism of various erroneous ideas, and deeply carrying out the comprehensive economization campaign.

### 首都和西南、西北很多设计单位　降低非生产性建筑造价

　　首都和西南、西北很多设计单位
　　降低非生产性建筑造价
    本报讯　根据全面节约的精神，首都各设计单位和施工单位纷纷和建房单位洽商降低非生产性建筑工程造价问题。大家对已经动工的一百五十多万平方公尺的建筑工程，正进行重新审核和修改设计，对正在设计的工程，都决定把造价降低到新标准以内。
    城市设计院本着适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观的原则和在结构不大变、不误施工的前提下，对七个工程的设计进行了修改，共可节约一百四十一万多元，占原造价的百分之十七点四。例如，对于某学院的办公楼和礼堂工程，适当降低了办公楼每层楼的高度，把斩假石改为水刷石，把额坊、花饰改为清水墙，把木地板改为水泥抹面；同时又取消了礼堂里的一些可以省去的设备，共可节约四十四万多元。
    中共中央办公厅原计划建筑的三万平方公尺的楼房，作了降低每层楼房高度等修改后，使每平方公尺的造价降低到新标准以内。国务院各部统一筹建的一万二千多平方公尺的办公楼工程，修改设计以后，每平方公尺可降低造价七十多元；二万三千平方公尺的宿舍楼，每平方公尺也降低了造价四十多元。
    本报讯　西南工程管理总局、西南工业建筑设计院、西南纺织管理局和重庆煤矿设计院四个单位根据全面节约精神修改设计，为国家节约八百四十多万元。西南工程管理总局在降低非生产性建筑标准中，仅六十七个工程项目的修改设计，就节省了二百六十三万元。西南纺织管理局原准备修建的高层宿舍，现在改为平房；原来标准太高的，都改变了结构。宿舍每平方公尺造价由五十五元降到二十元。其他生产性建筑项目的造价，也适当作了调整。重庆煤矿设计院在削减南桐煤矿输电线路等四项工程和修改其他设计中，节省了资金二百三十八万元。
    本报讯　西北工业建筑设计院正在展开全面节约工作。他们已经修改了四种宿舍的设计，可为国家节约资金一百万元以上；他们对七月份以后施工的非生产性建筑，提出了多种修改方案，工程造价可比过去降低百分之五十以上。
    这些方案，取消了盲目追求建筑形式造成浪费的大屋顶、正脊、垂脊、脊吻等，削减了为了装饰的立面有复杂花纹的阳台，取消了盲目提高工程标准的衣柜、双层窗等；同时把水泥地面改为砖铺地，把房屋高度作了适当的减低。
    在研究这些方案过程中，很多设计人员采取了积极负责的态度。为了降低工程造价问题，总工程师薛绳祖，有时研究到夜里两点多钟以后。刘大海、聂其俊、董世英等，则自动放弃了休息时间，赶着修改设计图纸。许多设计人员，还分别到西安、兰州两地重点工程宿舍区的施工现场，根据施工进度和备料情况，同建设、施工单位的负责人员充分交换意见，确定修改方案。
    他们看了李富春副总理作的“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告以后，受到了更大的启发。现在他们正学习这个报告，结合批判各种错误思想，深入开展全面节约工作。
