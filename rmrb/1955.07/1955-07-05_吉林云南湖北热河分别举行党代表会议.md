Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 2nd: The Third Representative Meeting of the Communist Party of China in Jilin Province was held in Changchun from June 10th to 26th.

　　During the meeting, the representatives studied and discussed the documents of the National Congress of the Party, and listened to and discussed the three reports of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC. They unanimously supported the resolutions of the National Congress of the Party, agreed with the reports of the Provincial Committee, and expressed their willingness to strive for their thorough implementation.

　　All the representatives, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined the pernicious influence spread by the Gao Gang anti-Party faction in Jilin Province and criticized the shortcomings and errors in their respective areas of work. The meeting held that it is necessary to raise revolutionary vigilance, continue to implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and the spirit of the National Congress of the Party, and regard the elimination of the influence of the Gao Gang anti-Party faction (in essence, the elimination of the influence of the bourgeoisie within the Party) as a long-term struggle to defend the Communist Party and the socialist cause.

　　The meeting held that, based on the specific conditions of the Jilin area, the focus of the Five-Year Plan is to develop agricultural production, while also grasping the leadership of capital construction and industrial production of key projects, and resolutely and comprehensively complete the national plan.

　　The meeting finally adopted the resolution of the Third Representative Meeting of the CPC Jilin Province and elected the Supervisory Committee of the CPC Jilin Province.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 2nd: The Third Representative Meeting of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province, which began on June 16th in Kunming, concluded on June 30th.

　　The representatives attending the meeting listened to and discussed the report of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC, "Strive to resolutely implement the resolutions of the National Congress of the Party." The representatives unanimously supported the resolutions and documents of the National Congress of the Party.

　　The meeting held that Yunnan is located on the border of our country, with many ethnic groups. In the border ethnic areas, the principle of prudence and steady progress should be followed to enrich and improve the content of ethnic regional autonomy, implement the rights of ethnic autonomy, and gradually achieve the nationalization of autonomous organs. Because counter-revolutionary activities are still rampant in some areas of Yunnan Province, and imperialism and the Kuomintang remnants are still constantly threatening and sabotaging, we should be more vigilant, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and crush all the conspiracies and sabotage of enemies at home and abroad.

　　The meeting supported the resolution of the National Congress of the Party on the Gao Gang-Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, and held that the Party organization in Yunnan had made serious localism errors in a period before the liberation of the province. Although this error has been overcome under the leadership of the Central Committee after the rectification campaign, it still has a certain impact, especially the bourgeois individualism, which still exists in large quantities within the Party. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism theory, persist in continuously opposing bourgeois individualism, raise revolutionary vigilance, and wage a resolute struggle against all bad people and bad things that harm the interests of the Party.

　　The meeting elected the Supervisory Committee of the CPC Yunnan Province.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 1st: The Fifth Representative Meeting of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province was held from June 6th to 29th.

　　The meeting listened to the reports of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the issue of Party building and the draft of Hubei Province's First Five-Year National Economic Plan. After full discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed with these two reports.

　　The representatives fully developed the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in the discussion and analyzed the current situation of class struggle by using the method of class analysis. The meeting held that it is necessary to draw lessons from the struggle to smash the Gao Gang-Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. According to the resolution of the National Congress of the Party, with the development of the class struggle situation, further strengthen Party building, enhance Party unity, implement the Party's principle of collective leadership, implement Party supervision, strengthen the Party's ideological and political work, oppose the erosion of the Party by bourgeois ideology, and resolutely struggle against all counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the victorious completion of the socialist construction cause.

　　The meeting finally elected the Supervisory Committee of the CPC Hubei Province and passed resolutions on carrying out a comprehensive conservation campaign and other matters.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, July 2nd: The Fourth Representative Meeting of the Communist Party of China in Rehe Province was held in Chengde City from June 15th to 29th.

　　The meeting listened to the reports made by the Rehe Provincial Committee of the CPC on "Resolutely Implement the Resolutions of the National Congress of the Party and Strive to Complete the Tasks of the National First Five-Year Construction Plan" and "Strengthen Party Building, Improve Party Leadership, and Strive to Complete the National Construction Plan." The meeting unanimously supported the resolutions of the National Congress of the Party and agreed with the two reports of the Provincial Committee.

　　Sixty-two representatives spoke at the plenary meeting. They conducted strict criticism and self-criticism of the leadership and work of Party organizations at all levels in the province and the shortcomings and errors in their respective work areas, especially regarding right-leaning paralysis thought and subjectivism, bureaucratism, and coercive commandism.
