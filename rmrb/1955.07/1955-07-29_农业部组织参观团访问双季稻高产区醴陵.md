The Ministry of Agriculture recently organized a double-season rice visiting group to visit Liling County, a well-known high-yield double-season rice area in Hunan Province. The members of the visiting group included some agricultural labor models, agricultural production cooperative directors, agricultural scientists and technical cadres from provinces such as Anhui, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Hubei. In Liling County, they listened to the local agricultural department's introduction to the double-season rice production situation and visited the double-season rice bumper harvest experience exhibition specially held for them. They successively visited the county farm and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Hejialong, Hequan, and Cuanxi townships. In order to allow the visitors to see the actual output, the Fifth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hequan Township organized the acceptance inspection of 2.5 mu of early rice. The results of the acceptance inspection showed a total of 1,865 jin of grain, with an average of more than 596 jin of dried grain per mu. The visitors believed that Liling County's double-season rice bumper harvest experience was exactly what other places lacked, and they expressed their intention to promote it after returning. Based on their own experience, they also put forward some beneficial suggestions for Liling County's production.

Farmers in Liling County have had the habit of planting double-season rice for a long time and have accumulated relatively rich farming experience. In 1952, 1953 and 1954, the average yield of double-season rice in the whole county was more than 610 jin per mu, which was more than 20% higher than the yield in the best years before liberation. Liling County is located in the Xiangjiang River Basin in eastern Hunan Province, and the entire county is basically a hilly area. According to investigations by the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and relevant local departments, the natural conditions such as climate, rainfall, and soil in Liling County are not significantly different from other hilly areas in Hunan Province suitable for planting double-season rice. The reason why farmers in Liling County are able to obtain increased double-season rice production is that they attach importance to repairing small-scale farmland water conservancy and improving farming techniques. They not only pay attention to intensive cultivation, increasing fertilizer application, and promoting close planting, but also, in view of the fact that double-season rice has a longer harvest time and consumes more land fertility than single-season rice, they pay special attention to improving varieties and applying top dressing in a timely manner to advance the maturity period of double-season rice, as well as universally planting green manure crops after the autumn harvest to cultivate land fertility and increase fertilizer.

    农业部组织参观团访问双季稻高产区醴陵
    本报讯　农业部最近组织双季稻参观团访问了湖南省著名的双季稻高产区醴陵县。参观团成员包括安徽、贵州、四川、广西、湖北等省的一部分农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社社长、农业科学工作者和技术干部。他们在醴陵县听了当地农业部门关于双季稻生产情况的介绍，参观了特地为他们举办的双季稻丰产经验展览会，先后访问了县农场以及何家垅、河泉、氽溪等乡的农业生产合作社和互助组。为使参观者看到实际产量，河泉乡第五农业生产合作社组织了二亩五分早稻的验收。验收结果，共收谷一千八百六十五斤，平均每亩折干谷五百九十六斤多。参观者认为醴陵县双季稻丰产经验正是各地所缺少的，纷纷表示回去要加以推广。他们还根据自己的经验，对醴陵县的生产提出一些有益的意见。
    醴陵县农民很早就有种植双季稻的习惯，并积累了较为丰富的耕作经验。一九五二年、一九五三年和一九五四年，全县的双季稻平均每亩产稻谷都在六百一十斤以上，比解放以前最好年成的产量高百分之二十以上。醴陵县位于湖南省东部湘江流域，全县基本上是丘陵地区。据湖南省农业厅和当地有关部门调查，醴陵县的气候、雨量、土壤等自然条件和湖南省适宜种双季稻的其他丘陵地区并无显著不同。醴陵县农民所以能够获得双季稻增产，是因为重视了整修小型农田水利和提高耕作技术。他们不仅注意精耕细作、增施肥料和推行密植，而且针对双季稻比单季稻收获时间长和耗费地力大的特点，特别注意从改良品种、适时追肥等方面来提早双季稻的成熟期，以及在秋收后普遍种植绿肥作物来培养地力和增加肥料。
