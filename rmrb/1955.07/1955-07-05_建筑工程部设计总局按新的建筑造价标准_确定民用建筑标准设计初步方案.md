Xinhua News Agency, July 4th. The General Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which is conducting standard designs for civil buildings nationwide, has produced some preliminary designs and plans for standard designs within the new building cost standards. These preliminary designs and plans were made at the meeting of the heads of major districts and the Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute under the General Design Bureau from June 21st to 29th.

The preliminary designs and plans made at this meeting are divided into two categories: multi-story buildings (preliminary designs) and single-story buildings (plans). Each category is further divided into six sets based on different building structures, costs, and regional conditions. These preliminary designs and plans are for single dormitories, residences, and offices, which currently have the largest engineering volume and are urgently needed in construction. Now, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is preparing to submit these preliminary designs and plans to relevant central leading organs for review and approval.

The preliminary designs and plans for these standard designs of civil buildings are based on the climate and other conditions of North China. Therefore, these preliminary designs and plans are only suitable for areas with the same climate as North China. The General Design Bureau has made different preliminary designs and plans according to the climate differences within this vast region. For example, when making architectural designs for Beijing, Luoyang, and Xi'an, different designs were made in terms of heating, cold protection, and heat prevention.

Before convening this meeting, the General Design Bureau sent designers to Tianjin and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to investigate people's living habits and residential conditions. The preliminary designs and plans for the standard designs of civil buildings now made stipulate that the building cost is at least 48 yuan per square meter for multi-story buildings and at least 29 yuan for single-story buildings; the service life of buildings is 40 to 60 years for multi-story buildings and 10 to 15 years for single-story buildings. The rent and utility bills paid by residents living in multi-story buildings built according to the new standard design, due to the low construction cost and reasonable and applicable design, will be reduced by one-third or one-half compared to living in multi-story buildings built according to the previous minimum standard design.

The designers participating in this meeting are currently conducting standard designs for multi-story and single-story buildings in cold areas such as Northeast China and relatively hot areas in the Yangtze River Basin based on the above preliminary designs and plans, combined with the specific conditions of these areas. The meeting also formulated 78 methods for modifying the current design and discussed other issues of implementing the principle of economy in design.

The designers participating in this meeting all believe that through the specific design work carried out at the meeting, their design thinking has been improved a step further. Everyone believes that only by carrying out such standard design can it conform to the country's construction policy and meet the current living standards of the people; those who believe that there is no need for design or construction technology after the construction cost is reduced are wrong. They believe that after the construction cost is reduced, it is even more necessary to give full play to the technical talents of designers to ensure that the building is suitable and guaranteed in quality.

### 建筑工程部设计总局按新的建筑造价标准  确定民用建筑标准设计初步方案

    建筑工程部设计总局按新的建筑造价标准
    确定民用建筑标准设计初步方案
    新华社四日讯　为全国进行民用建筑标准设计的建筑工程部设计总局，在新的建筑造价标准以内作出了一些标准设计的初步设计和方案。这些初步设计和方案，是在设计总局六月二十一日到二十九日召开的所属各大区和北京工业建筑设计院院长会议上作出来的。
    这次会议上作出的初步设计和方案，共分楼房（初步设计）和平房（方案）两类。每类又根据建筑结构、造价和地区等不同条件，分作六套。这些初步设计和方案，都是当前工程量最大、施工中急需的单身宿舍、住宅和办公室。现在，建筑工程部准备把这些初步设计和方案送中央有关领导机关审查批准。
    这些民用建筑标准设计的初步设计和方案，都是以华北地区的气候等条件为依据设计的。因此，这些初步设计和方案，只适合于同华北气候相同的地区。设计总局根据这一广大地区内气候差异的情况，分别作出了不同的初步设计和方案。如作北京、洛阳和西安等三个地区的建筑设计时，在采暖、防寒防热等方面都作了不同的设计。
    设计总局召开这次会议以前，曾派出设计人员到天津市、石景山钢铁厂调查了人民的生活习惯和居住情况。现在作出的民用建筑标准设计的初步设计和方案，规定建筑造价楼房每平方公尺最低是四十八元，平房最低是二十九元；建筑的使用年限楼房可达到四十年到六十年，平房是十年到十五年。按新的标准设计建造的楼房，由于建筑造价低，设计合理适用，居住者支付的房租和水电费，将比居住按过去最低标准设计建造的楼房还要减少三分之一或一半。
    参加这次会议的设计人员，目前正根据上述初步设计和方案，结合东北等寒冷地带和长江流域较热地带的具体情况，进行这些地带的楼房和平房的标准设计。会议上还制定了修改当前设计的七十八条办法，并讨论了在设计中贯彻节约方针的其他问题。
    参加这次会议的设计人员，都认为通过会议上进行的具体设计工作，把自己的设计思想提高了一步。大家认为只有进行这样的标准设计，才符合国家的建设方针，符合目前人民的生活水平；那些认为建筑造价降低以后就用不着设计或不需要施工技术的看法是错误的。他们认为，建筑造价降低以后，要求建筑物适用并保证质量，就更需要发挥设计人员的技术才能。
