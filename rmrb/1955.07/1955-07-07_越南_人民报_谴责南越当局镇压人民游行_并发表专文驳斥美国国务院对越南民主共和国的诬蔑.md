Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: The "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 6th, strongly condemning the South Vietnamese authorities for suppressing the demonstration held by the people of Saigon and Cholon on July 3rd to demand consultations on general elections.

The commentary pointed out that the demonstration by the people of Saigon and Cholon reflected the ardent patriotism and the will for unification of all the people of South Vietnam. This was a completely legitimate demonstration. Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords clearly stated that each side should guarantee the democratic freedoms of the people.

The commentary said that the fascist measures taken by the Ngo Dinh Diem government to suppress the demonstration once again demonstrated that the Ngo Dinh Diem government openly opposed the people's will for unification and patriotism, and trampled on the most basic freedoms of the South Vietnamese people.

The commentary pointed out that the people of Saigon, Cholon, and the entire South Vietnam are struggling to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to conduct consultations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from July 20, 1955, to discuss next year's general election, and demanding the release of the arrested people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on the 6th, refuting the recent report on the situation in Southeast Asia issued by the US State Department, which slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for receiving many war materials from "Communist countries."

The article pointed out that the International Commission had already conducted investigations and concluded that no weapons had been transported into the North from foreign countries. The US imperialists' despicable trick of crying "stop thief" is merely to cover up their increasingly open interference in South Vietnam.

The article said: The facts in South Vietnam have exposed the US imperialists' ambition to turn South Vietnam into their military base in preparation for re-igniting the war. The US imperialists sent military delegations into South Vietnam to train and strengthen the Ngo Dinh Diem army, to make it an American mercenary army. The Ngo Dinh Diem army radio station also said on June 16: "At present, the international and domestic situation requires the country to establish a strong military force, which should be larger than before the signing of the Geneva Accords if possible."

The article pointed out that it is clear that the US imperialists and Ngo Dinh Diem are openly violating the Geneva Accords.

　　越南“人民报”谴责南越当局镇压人民游行
    并发表专文驳斥美国国务院对越南民主共和国的诬蔑
    新华社河内六日电　“人民报”六日发表评论，强烈地谴责南越当局镇压西贡、堤岸人民七月三日为要求协商普选而举行的游行。
    评论指出，西贡、堤岸人民的游行反映了南越全体人民的热烈的爱国主义和要求统一的意志。这是完全合法的游行。日内瓦协定第十四条丙款明确地提到，每方应保证人民的民主自由。
    评论说，吴庭艳政府镇压游行的法西斯措施再一次表明，吴庭艳政府公然反对人民要求统一的意志和爱国主义，蹂躏了南越人民最基本的自由。
    评论指出，西贡、堤岸和整个南越的人民正在进行斗争，敦促南越当局从一九五五年七月二十日起同越南民主共和国政府进行协商来讨论明年的普选，并要求释放被捕人民。
    新华社河内六日电　越南“人民报”六日登载了一篇文章，驳斥美国国务院最近发表的关于东南亚情况的报告，这个报告污蔑越南民主共和国正在从“共产党国家”得到许多战争物资。
    文章指出，国际委员会早已进行调查并作出结论，认为没有从外国运入给北部的武器。美帝国主义又一次的贼喊捉贼的卑鄙手段不过是为了掩饰他们对南越日益公开干涉的行为。
    文章说：南越的事实已经暴露了美帝国主义企图把南越变为他们的军事基地以准备重新挑起战争的野心。美帝国主义把军事代表团派入南越，训练和加强吴庭艳军队，要使它成为一支美国的雇佣军队。吴庭艳军队广播电台在六月十六日也说：“目前，国际和国内局势要求国家建立一支强大的兵力，在可能时要比日内瓦协定签订以前更要多。”
    文章指出，很明显，美帝国主义和吴庭艳是在公开地违反日内瓦协定。
