　　The Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Overpays Profits by More Than 700,000 Yuan in the First Half of the Year

　　In the first half of this year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant paid a total of more than 2.68 million yuan in profits to the state, overpaying by more than 740,000 yuan compared to the original plan.

　　In the first half of the year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant further improved and strengthened its production technology preparation work; all factory employees actively promoted 24 advanced experiences such as "short-arc welding" and proposed more than 100 rationalization proposals, which increased labor productivity by more than 6 percent compared to the original plan. The reject rates of all workshops have also been significantly reduced. The steel casting workshop, which had the highest reject rate, saw a decrease of more than 17 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. In addition, due to the strict control of the finance department, the average monthly expenditure on administrative management fees in the first half of the year was more than 20,000 yuan less than last year.

　　In the first half of this year, the plant also completed or overfulfilled the state plan in terms of total production value, total product value, product variety, cost, and capital turnover. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　沈阳矿山机器厂上半年多缴利润七十多万元
    今年上半年，沈阳矿山机器厂上缴给国家的利润共二百六十八万多元，比原计划多缴了七十四万多元。
    上半年，沈阳矿山机器厂进一步改进和加强了生产技术准备工作；全厂职工积极推广了“短弧焊接”等二十四种先进经验，并提出了一百多件合理化建议，使劳动生产率比原订计划提高了百分之六以上。各车间废品率也都显著降低，废品最多的铸钢车间，第二季度废品率比第一季度下降了百分之十七多。此外，由于财务部门严格的控制，上半年行政管理费用的开支，每月平均比去年节省了两万多元。
    今年上半年，这个厂在生产总值、产品总值、产品品种、成本、资金周转等方面也都完成或超额完成了国家计划。（新华社）
