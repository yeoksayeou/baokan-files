Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 19th: The new Italian government, headed by Christian Democrat Segni, won a vote of confidence in the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the 18th by a slim majority. Members of the Communist and Socialist parties voted against the Segni government.

Segni presented the list of his new cabinet and its policy program to the Chamber of Deputies on the 13th. In his policy program, Segni stated that the policies of the new government were not much different from those of the previous Scelba government. He declared that Italy would continue to be faithful to the North Atlantic Treaty and the European Union, although he also expressed the desire to promote the easing of tensions between East and West.

During the debate on the new government's policy program, Socialist Party member Martino stated that the Socialist Party could not support the new government, but on certain specific issues, the party would sometimes be willing to support the Segni government for the benefit of the country and the Italian working people.

Communist Party member Pajetta explained in detail the reasons why the Communist Party opposed the new government in his speech. Pajetta said: This government, "while recognizing the seriousness of some problems and admitting that it is impossible to continue to pursue policies that have been condemned by the whole country, is unable to pursue a new policy. It is the product of a failed compromise. We reject the formation of this government and cannot accept its program."

Pajetta went on to point out that the Scelba government was forced to resign due to public opposition and anger. He said that it is impossible to solve the country's problems without taking into account the influence of millions of Communists and Socialists across the country.

Another representative of the Communist Party parliamentary group, Ingrao, criticized the foreign policy of successive Christian Democratic governments in recent years. He said that Italy's foreign policy is in crisis, that it is subservient to the United States and lacks initiative.

Ingrao concluded by saying that we will vote against the Segni government. However, we will support any initiative taken by the government in seeking a genuine relaxation of international tensions, disarmament and improved relations with all countries.

    塞尼政府在意大利下院以微弱多数获得信任
    意共产党和社会党议员投票反对塞尼政府
    新华社十九日讯　罗马消息：以天主教民主党人塞尼为首的意大利新政府，十八日在意大利下议院的信任投票中以微弱多数获得信任。共产党和社会党议员投票反对塞尼政府。
    塞尼在十三日向下议院提出新内阁的名单和施政纲领。塞尼在施政纲领中表明，新政府的政策和前任谢尔巴政府的政策没有什么不同。他声明意大利将继续忠实于北大西洋公约和欧洲联盟，虽然他同时也表示要促进东西方之间紧张局势的缓和。
    在辩论新政府的施政纲领时，社会党议员马蒂诺发言说，社会党不能支持新政府，但是在某些具体问题上，这个党为了国家和意大利劳动人民的利益，有时愿意支持塞尼政府。
    共产党议员巴叶塔在发言中详细说明了共产党反对这个新政府的理由。巴叶塔说：这个政府“虽然承认一些问题的严重性和承认继续奉行为全国斥责的政策是办不到的，但是它又不能奉行一种新政策。它是一个失败的妥协的产物。我们拒绝这个政府的组成，也不能接受它的政纲。”
    巴叶塔接着指出，谢尔巴政府是由于公众的反对和愤怒而被迫辞职的。他说，如果不考虑到全国数以百万计的共产党人和社会党人的影响是不可能解决国家的问题的。
    共产党议会党团的另一名代表英格拉奥批评最近几年来历届天主教民主党政府的外交政策。他说，意大利的外交政策是在危机中，它屈从美国而缺乏主动性。
    英格拉奥最后说，我们要投票反对塞尼政府。然而我们将支持政府在谋求国际紧张局势的真正缓和、裁军和改善同各国的关系方面所采取的任何主动。
