Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 23rd: According to a report from the Polish News Agency, the head of the Soviet government delegation, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, M. Suslov, delivered a speech at the Polish National Day celebration on the 21st. The following is an excerpt:

    On this great National Day—the festival of the revival of the new People's Democratic Poland—please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet government, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and all the Soviet people, to extend warm fraternal greetings to you, and through you, to all the Polish people.

    The Soviet people wholeheartedly celebrate Poland's National Day together with the Polish people. The period that has passed since the Soviet armed forces, together with the fighting units of the Polish army, liberated Polish territory from the fascist aggressors has powerfully convinced everyone that a new era, an era of national and social rebirth of Poland, has begun in your country's history.

    During the eleven years of People's Democratic rule, the Polish people have traversed a glorious road of struggle and victory. Under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish nation has resolutely consolidated the People's Democratic system of the state and has victoriously developed and strengthened this new, free, and independent People's Democratic Poland.

    In the struggle for the rebirth of a strong, independent, People's Democratic Poland, for the establishment of socialist foundations in Poland, the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and other countries of the powerful socialist camp were, and will continue to be, the true friends of the Polish people.

    The Soviet Union highly cherishes its friendship with the free Polish people. It observes the creative achievements of the fraternal Polish people with sympathy and affection; and sincerely rejoices and is happy for the brilliant achievements you have made in peaceful and creative labor.

    The friendship and cooperation between our countries, strengthened and consolidated in the years of the common liberation struggle to crush the aggressors, has been further developed in the years of post-war peaceful construction.

    The fact that today's festive gathering is being held in this magnificent Palace of Culture and Science, built by Soviet workers with Soviet materials and presented as a gift to Poland, is another proof of Soviet-Polish friendship. We hope that this Palace of Culture and Science will become a powerful symbol of the great and lasting friendship between our countries.

    The unity and friendship among the countries of the democratic and socialist camp is unbreakable and eternal. This friendship is the greatest and most significant factor in present international life.

    The relations between the Soviet Union and Poland after the Second World War, like the relations between the countries in the united democratic camp, are a new type of socialist relations, unprecedented in history. It is based on a common desire to achieve great ultimate goals, to satisfy the most important interests of the working masses, and on the principles of complete equality, fraternal friendship, and mutual assistance. This relationship is a concrete manifestation of the great Leninist idea of friendship between free and equal countries, and the victory of the principle of internationalism.

    The further strengthening of the solidarity among the nationalities of the Soviet Union and the nationalities of the People's Democratic countries has been demonstrated by the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance among Eight Countries signed in your capital, Warsaw, this May. The results of the Warsaw Conference on safeguarding peace and security in Europe are of historic significance and are a new and decisive proof of the unity and rock-solid strength of the peace-loving, democratic, and socialist camp.

    The Soviet Union, Poland, and the various countries of the socialist camp, which are developing their peaceful economies, are deeply concerned with maintaining lasting peace and ensuring the security of all countries. The Soviet government and the governments of the People's Democratic countries, supported by all progressive people throughout the world, are stubbornly and consistently struggling to consolidate peace and ease international tensions.

    The people of our two countries, as well as the progressive people all over the world, are paying great attention to the progress of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference.

    The ordinary people of all countries sincerely hope that the participants in this conference will work together to find ways to peacefully resolve outstanding international issues.

    The talks between the Soviet government delegation and the government delegation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on normalizing and improving relations between the two countries are a significant contribution to the cause of peace, friendship between nations, and security. The results of the Belgrade talks show that despite the various conspiracies of hostile forces, the strengthening and further development of friendly cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is entirely possible.

    It should be emphasized with great satisfaction that Poland and the countries of the socialist camp have shown complete unanimity in their evaluation of the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations, as well as in their views on the further development and strengthening of friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and between the People's Democratic countries and Yugoslavia, because this is in line with the vital interests of their respective nations and the interests of peace and socialism.

    There is no doubt that People's Poland will, in the near future, achieve even more brilliant achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction, in the struggle to improve the welfare of the working people, and in the struggle for the victory of socialism. The increasingly close alliance between the working class and the working peasants, the more resolute unity of the entire Polish nation around the Polish United Workers' Party and the People's Government, and the friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, all guarantee this.

    The working people of Poland can be assured that the Soviet Union will continue to be their reliable and sincere friend, and that the Soviet Union will continue to develop and consolidate economic and cultural cooperation between our allied countries, and will provide comprehensive assistance and support to Poland in building a new and beautiful socialist life.

    On this great National Day, please allow me to wish the talented and hardworking Polish nation new and brilliant victories in the struggle to build a socialist society.

    苏斯洛夫在波兰国庆节庆祝会上讲话
    新华社华沙二十三日讯　据波兰通讯社报道：苏联政府代表团团长、苏联共产党中央委员会书记米·苏斯洛夫二十一日在波兰国庆节庆祝会上的讲话摘要如下。
    在这伟大的国庆日——新的人民民主波兰的复兴节——的时候，请允许我代表苏联政府、苏联共产党中央委员会和全体苏联人民，向你们，并通过你们向全体波兰人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    苏联人民同波兰人民一起衷心地庆祝波兰的国庆日。自从苏联武装部队同波兰陆军战斗部队把波兰国土从法西斯侵略者手中解放出来以来，已过去了的这一段时期有力地使大家相信，一个新的纪元、波兰民族和社会重生的纪元已经在你们国家历史中开始了。
    在人民民主统治的十一年的时期内，波兰人民走过了斗争和胜利的光荣道路。在工人阶级和它的先锋队波兰统一工人党的领导下，波兰民族毅然决然地巩固了国家的人民民主制度，并且在胜利地发展和加强这个新的、自由的、独立的人民民主波兰。
    在为一个强大的、独立的、人民民主波兰的重生，为在波兰建立社会主义基础而进行的斗争中，苏联各民族和强有力的社会主义阵营的其他国家过去是，今后仍然是波兰人民的真正朋友。
    苏联非常珍视它同自由波兰人民的友谊。它以同情和友爱的态度注视着兄弟般的波兰人民的创造性的成就；对于你们在和平和创造性的劳动中所取得的辉煌成就真心地感到欢欣和高兴。
    在为粉碎侵略者而进行的共同解放斗争的年代里加强和巩固了的我们国家的友谊与合作，在战后和平建设的年代中进一步发展了。
    今天的节日大会举行的地点——苏联工人用苏联的材料建筑起来的这座宏伟堂皇的文化科学宫作为礼物交给波兰一事，是波苏友谊的又一个证明。我们希望这座文化科学宫成为我们国家之间伟大和持久的友谊的有力的象征。
    团结民主和社会主义阵营中各个国家的友谊是牢不可破的和永恒的。这种友谊是现时国际生活中最伟大和最重大的因素。
    第二次世界大战后，苏联和波兰之间的关系正如团结一致的民主阵营中各个国家之间的关系一样，是一种社会主义的、前所未有的新关系，它是以达到伟大的最后目标的共同愿望和满足劳动群众最重大的利益以及完全平等、兄弟般的友谊和互相帮助的原则为基础的。这种关系是伟大的列宁主义关于自由平等国家的友谊的思想的具体表现，是国际主义原则的胜利。
    苏联各民族和人民民主国家各民族之间的团结的进一步加强，已由今年五月在你们的首都华沙签订的八国友好合作互助条约中表现出来了。关于保卫欧洲和平安全的华沙会议的结果，是具有历史性重要意义的，它是和平民主和社会主义阵营各国的团结和磐石般力量的新的决定性的证明。
    正在发展和平经济的苏联、波兰和社会主义阵营各个国家，十分关心保持持久和平和保障各国的安全。苏联政府和各人民民主国家政府得到全世界一切进步人民的支持，它们正在顽强地、始终不渝地为巩固和平与缓和国际紧张局势而进行斗争。
    我们两国的民族以及全世界的进步人民都以极大的注意注视着日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的进程。
    各国的普通人民真诚地希望这次会议的参加者共同努力寻求和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的方法。
    苏联政府代表团和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府代表团之间的关于使两国关系正常化和改善两国关系的会谈是对于和平事业、国家间的友谊和安全的重大贡献。贝尔格莱德会谈的结果表明，尽管有敌对力量的种种阴谋，苏联和南斯拉夫之间的友好合作关系的加强和进一步发展是完全可能的。
    应该极其满意地强调指出，波兰和社会主义阵营各国在对苏南谈判结果的评价方面，以及在有关进一步发展和加强苏联同南斯拉夫之间的友谊和人民民主国家同南斯拉夫之间的友谊问题的看法上，都表现了完全一致，因为这是符合于它们各民族的切身利益以及和平和社会主义的利益的。
    毫无疑问，人民波兰在最近的将来在所有经济和文化建设方面，在提高劳动人民的福利斗争中，在为争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，将获得更加辉煌的成就。工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的日益紧密，整个波兰民族更加坚决地团结在波兰统一工人党和人民政府的周围，和苏联以及和整个社会主义阵营的国家的友好与联盟，所有这一切都保证了这一点。
    波兰劳动人民可以确信：苏联将继续是他们可靠的和真诚的朋友，苏联将继续发展和巩固我们盟国之间的经济和文化合作，它将在波兰为建设一个新的美好的社会主义生活方面，给予全面的援助和支持。
    请允许我在伟大的国庆日，祝贺有才能的和勤劳的波兰民族在建设社会主义社会的斗争中获得新的辉煌的胜利。
