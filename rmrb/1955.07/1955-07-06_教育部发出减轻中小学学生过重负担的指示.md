The Ministry of Education issued instructions on July 1 regarding the reduction of the excessive burden on middle and primary school students. The instructions stated that the excessive burden on students has been a problem for several years. After the autumn of 1954, a new and serious situation arose. Students have heavy extracurricular assignments and many exams. Students are busy coping with homework and exams every day, getting up early and going to bed late, not resting at noon, and also rushing to finish schoolwork on Sundays, often in a state of nervous tension. Some schools and certain subjects teach beyond the scope of textbooks and teaching syllabi, arbitrarily supplementing teaching content and accelerating the pace of instruction. Some schools also arbitrarily increase the number of class periods, not following the provisions of the teaching plan. In schools with excessively heavy academic burdens, study time generally exceeds the time stipulated in the State Council's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools" in July 1951.

The instructions noted that the reasons for the excessive burden on students in recent years are mainly because the Ministry of Education did not simplify certain textbooks that were too heavy early enough, lacked specific guidance on basic issues such as improving teacher levels and the levels of school leaders, and failed to promptly supervise and correct the problem of excessive burden on students. After the autumn of 1954, the educational administrative organs in some regions had errors in their guiding ideology for improving the quality of education. They did not conscientiously implement the educational policy of all-round development, neglected students' health and ideological education, and were overly eager to improve teaching quality and learning quality, adopting some unrealistic practices that exacerbated the severity of the situation.

The instructions pointed out that the excessive burden has seriously damaged the physical and mental health of students and weakened political and ideological education. Because the excessive burden only allows students to passively cope with homework and exams, and to memorize by rote, they have no time to review and consolidate what they have learned, and cannot digest and apply it, making it difficult to truly improve the quality of knowledge.

The instructions believe that in addition to improving teaching materials, raising the level of teachers, and improving school leadership, the following measures must be taken to solve the problem of excessive student burden:

First, strictly control the amount of teaching material and the pace of instruction according to textbooks and teaching syllabi, and do not allow arbitrary increases or acceleration. Correct the practice of discarding textbooks and teaching a separate set of materials, copying excessive notes, making extensive digressions, and assigning students to read too many reference books. It is not allowed to arbitrarily increase the number of class periods.

Second, reduce the excessive burden of extracurricular homework. Teachers are required to work hard to study teaching materials and improve teaching methods, to explain lessons clearly and thoroughly, to pay attention to the work of review, digestion, and consolidation, to guide students to develop the habit of reviewing their lessons before doing homework, and to correct the past tendency of abandoning review and rushing to do homework by rote. Reduce the amount of extracurricular homework - some subjects do not have to leave written homework for each lesson (only appropriate homework should be left in certain paragraphs); some subjects can set aside a certain amount of time in class for classroom assignments to reduce extracurricular homework; the school leadership should control the number of hours and the amount of homework for various extracurricular assignments in each grade. Homework questions are not allowed to exceed the scope of the teaching syllabus and textbooks, and are not allowed to exceed the actual level of the students.

Third, strengthen the usual assessment of grades and improve the examination system. The types and frequency of written examinations can be reduced, and only academic year examinations and graduation examinations should be held. Semester exams can be temporarily held before the usual grade assessment methods can be correctly mastered. The test questions and scoring should have correct standards and scales.

Fourth, improve extracurricular activities. Extracurricular physical exercise, recreational activities, productive labor, extracurricular research, school and class meetings within the school, as well as social activities outside the school, are entirely led and arranged by the school administration in a unified manner, and various activities are not allowed to be directly arranged to the school from various aspects outside the school. Appropriately strengthen physical exercise and recreational activities. Reduce the burden of Youth League members (especially League and team cadres) with too many meetings, concurrent positions, and tasks.

Fifth, observe work and rest times to ensure students' sleep and rest. The provisions of the State Council in July 1951 must be strictly observed. The student's study time, extracurricular activity time, and community activity time must not exceed the regulations. Ensure students' sleep time and ensure that students have complete rest on Sundays and Saturday nights.

The instructions pointed out that in order to implement the above methods, it is necessary to criticize erroneous understandings and practices in improving the quality of education.

The instructions finally pointed out that reducing the excessive burden on students is not to lower the quality of education, so it is also wrong to arbitrarily change the teaching plan, reduce the content of teaching materials, lengthen the pace of teaching, and excessively reduce or make homework and examinations too easy. Reducing the excessive burden is to enable students to learn better, not to advocate carelessness, laziness, or shortcuts in learning.

### 教育部发出减轻中小学学生过重负担的指示

　　教育部发出减轻中小学学生过重负担的指示
    教育部在七月一日发出关于减轻中、小学学生过重负担的指示。指示说，中小学学生负担过重，是几年来存在着的一个问题。一九五四年秋季以后，发生了新的严重情况。学生的课外作业繁重、考试多。学生每天忙于应付作业和考试，早起晚睡，中午不休息，星期日也赶功课，经常处在神经紧张的状态中。有些学校的某些学科的教学超出教科书和教学大纲的范围，任意补充教材内容和加快授课进度。还有一些学校，不按照教学计划的规定，随便增加上课的节数时数。在课业负担过重的学校，学习时间普遍超过一九五一年七月政务院“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”所规定的时间。
    产生几年来学生负担过重的原因，主要是由于教育部对某些分量过重的教材没有及早精简，对提高教师水平和学校领导干部水平等基本问题缺乏具体指导，对学生负担过重问题未及早督促纠正。一九五四年秋季以后，有的地区的教育行政机关，在提高教育质量的指导思想上有错误，没有认真贯彻全面发展的教育方针，忽视学生的健康和思想教育，对于提高教学质量和提高学习质量的要求过急，并采用了一些不切实际的做法，更加重了这一情况的严重程度。
    指示指出，负担过重已经严重地损害了学生的身心健康，削弱了政治思想教育。又因为负担过重使学生只能被动地忙于应付作业和考试，忙于死记硬背，对于所学知识没有时间复习和巩固，不能消化和运用，使知识质量也难真正提高。
    指示认为解决学生负担过重问题除了改善教材，提高教师水平，改进学校领导等基本办法外，目前还必须采取下列办法：
    第一，根据教科书和教学大纲严格掌握教材分量和授课进度，不准随便加多和加快。纠正教学中丢开教科书另讲一套、多抄笔记、大量旁征博引、指定学生阅读过多的参考书等做法。不准随便增加上课的节数时数。
    第二，减轻课外作业的过重负担。要求教师努力钻研教材和改进教法，做到讲课讲清楚讲透彻，注意复习、消化和巩固的工作，指导学生养成先复习好功课然后再做作业的习惯，纠正过去放弃复习而死记硬背地赶作业的偏向。减少课外作业的分量——有些学科不必每课都留书面作业（只在一定段落留适当作业即可）；有些学科可在课堂留出一定时间进行课堂作业，减少课外作业；各年级各种课外作业时数和作业分量，学校领导方面应加控制。留作业题不准超出教学大纲和教科书的范围，不准超出学生的实际水平。
    第三，加强平时的成绩考查和改善考试制度。可减少书面考试的种类和次数，只举行学年考试和毕业考试，在平时成绩考查办法未能正确掌握以前可暂时举行学期考试。出考试题和评分应有正确的标准和尺度。
    第四，改进课外活动。校内的课外体育锻炼、文娱活动、生产劳动、课外研究、校会班会以及校外社会活动，完全由学校行政统一领导和安排，校外各方面不得直接向学校布置各种活动。适当加强体育锻炼和文娱活动。减轻青年团员（特别是团、队干部）的会议多、兼职多、任务多等负担。
    第五，遵守作息时间，保证学生的睡眠和休息。必须严格遵守政务院一九五一年七月的规定，学生的学习时间、课外活动时间、和社团活动时间不得超过规定。保证学生的睡眠时间，保证学生星期日和星期六夜晚完全休息。
    指示指出：为了贯彻上述各种办法，必须批判在提高教育质量中的错误认识和错误做法。
    指示最后指出：减轻学生过重负担不是降低教育质量，故随便变更教学计划、削减教材内容、拉长授课进度、作业和考试过分减少或过分容易等，也是错误的。减轻过重负担是为了使学生学习得更好，不是提倡学习上的马虎、偷懒、取巧。
