Xinhua News Agency, London, July 11th (TASS): According to Reuters, Indian Prime Minister Nehru left London on the 10th and flew back to India via Cairo. Nehru visited Britain for two days, during which he held talks with British Prime Minister Eden. According to the British Central Office of Information, "The talks involved political issues of mutual concern, including the Far East situation and the upcoming Four-Power Heads of Government Conference in Geneva."

Before his departure, Nehru held a press conference at London Airport. When talking about the prospects of the Geneva Conference, Nehru said that he did not think any unexpected plans would be formulated at the Geneva Conference, but "there is no doubt that several steps can be expected to appear in the peaceful settlement of disputes." Nehru then said: "It seems that we have reached an excellent moment to shift from the tense atmosphere of the so-called Cold War to peace."

Nehru continued: "I don't think complete peace will appear suddenly. But this is a turning point, and people in all countries have a strong feeling for peace."

Someone asked Nehru if he had the impression during his visit to the Soviet Union that Russia hoped to ease international tensions. Nehru replied: "I believe there is such a desire to ease international tensions and promote disarmament." According to Nehru, he also believes that the Soviet Union has a desire to use its resources for peaceful development. Nehru also said that he and Eden discussed the Taiwan issue.

Prime Minister Eden and diplomatic envoys from various countries saw Nehru off at the airport.

    尼赫鲁总理离伦敦返回印度
    他在启程前向记者谈四大国会议等问题
    新华社十一日讯　塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：据路透社报道，印度总理尼赫鲁十日离伦敦经开罗飞返印度。尼赫鲁在英国访问了两天，在访问期间同英国首相艾登进行了会谈。据英国中央新闻处说：“会谈涉及到了双方共同关心的政治问题，其中包括远东局势和即将在日内瓦举行的四大国政府首脑会议。”
    尼赫鲁启程以前在伦敦机场举行了记者招待会。尼赫鲁在谈到日内瓦会议的前途时说，他认为，在日内瓦会议上，未必会制定出任何出人意外的计划，但是，“毫无疑问，可以指望出现在和平解决争端方面的若干步骤”。尼赫鲁接着说：“似乎我们已经到达了一个绝好的时机，从所谓冷战的紧张气氛转向和平。”
    尼赫鲁继续说：“我并不以为，完全的和平会突然出现。但是，这是一个转折点，在一切国家的人民中都对和平怀着强烈的情感。”
    有人问尼赫鲁，他在访问苏联时，是否留下这样一种印象：俄国希望促使国际紧张局势趋向缓和。尼赫鲁回答说：“我相信有着这样一种促使国际紧张局势趋向缓和以及促进裁减军备的愿望。”据尼赫鲁说，他还相信苏联有把自己的资源用于和平发展的愿望。尼赫鲁又说，他同艾登讨论了台湾问题。
    在机场欢送尼赫鲁的有艾登首相和各国外交使节。
