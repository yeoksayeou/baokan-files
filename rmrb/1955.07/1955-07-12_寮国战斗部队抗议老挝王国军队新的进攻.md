    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 9th – The Royal Lao Army, in violation of the Geneva Accords, continues to infiltrate the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units and attack them.
    On June 22nd, the Royal side airdropped two companies of troops in Baka (20 kilometers south of Muong Phine) and Bon Hom (3 kilometers north of Baka). These troops also carried out terrorist activities against the people in the neighboring two villages.
    On July 1st and 2nd, the Royal side airdropped a large amount of weapons and food to the troops operating in the Heutou area (approximately 10 kilometers southwest of Sam Neua), preparing to expand military operations.
    On July 5th, the 8th Battalion of the Royal Army fiercely attacked the Laotian Fighting Units north of Bon Ouan (approximately 10 kilometers south of Muong Phine). The Laotian Fighting Units, in self-defense, repelled this attack.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 9th – Keoson, a representative of the General Headquarters of the Laotian Fighting Units, sent a letter to the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos and the Royal Lao Government on July 3rd, strongly protesting the new military offensives carried out by the Royal Lao Army against the Laotian Fighting Units.
    The letter pointed out that the Royal Government, on June 20th, dispatched numerous troops to attack the Nasala area east of Muong Phine, attempting to expand its occupied territory. They also continuously mobilized troops and attacked the Laotian Fighting Units stationed in Nasala Village again on July 1st. These actions by the Royal Government seriously violated Articles 14 and 19 of the Geneva Accords and created a tense situation.
    The Laotian Fighting Units declared that the Royal Lao Government should bear full responsibility for this tense situation. The Laotian Fighting Units also requested the International Commission to immediately take effective measures to force the Royal side to immediately cease all military actions and offensives against the Laotian Fighting Units, to ease the situation, and to create conditions for the negotiation between the two sides' military delegations to achieve positive results.

    寮国战斗部队抗议老挝王国军队新的进攻
    新华社河内九日电　老挝王国军队违反日内瓦协定，继续不断地渗入寮国战斗部队集结区，进攻寮国战斗部队。
    六月二十二日，王国方面在巴卡（芒奔以南二十公里）和本富（巴卡以北三公里）空投了两个连的军队。这批军队并且对邻近的两个村庄的人民进行恐怖行动。
    七月一日和二日，王国方面曾给在会头地区（桑怒西南约十公里）活动的部队空投很多武器和粮食，准备扩大军事行动。
    七月五日，王国军队第八营曾在本玩（芒奔以南约十公里）以北猛攻寮国战斗部队。寮国战斗部队方面为了自卫，打退了这次进攻。
    新华社河内九日电　寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在七月三日给老挝国际监督和监察委员会和老挝王国政府一封信，强硬抗议老挝王国军队对寮国战斗部队进行新的军事进攻。
    信中指出，王国政府在六月二十日，派遣了许多部队向芒奔以东的那萨拉地区进攻，企图扩大占领地区。他们又不断地调动军队，在七月一日再次向驻扎在那萨拉村的寮国战斗部队进攻。王国政府的这些行为严重地违背了日内瓦协定十四条和十九条，造成了紧张局势。
    寮国战斗部队声明，老挝王国政府对这个紧张局势应负完全责任。寮国战斗部队同时要求国际委员会立即采取有效措施，迫使王国方面立即停止一切军事行动和对寮国战斗部队的进攻，使局势得到缓和，为双方军事代表团的谈判取得良好结果创造条件。
