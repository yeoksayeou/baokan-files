What Kind of Care Is Needed
Song Zheng

　　Within our Party, some comrades, after committing errors and receiving criticism and disciplinary action from the Party, do not earnestly correct their mistakes. Instead, they become dissatisfied with the Party organization, feeling that the Party organization lacks "warmth" and "care," that the Party organization has "wronged" them, and is "cold and heartless" towards them, and so on. Since these comrades are full of grievances, they always try to find one or two "confidants" to vent their complaints and dissatisfaction, hoping to get some "warmth" and "comfort" from these "confidants." In their view, this is merely letting off steam in front of comrades and getting a little "sympathy" from others, at most just liberalism, and not a serious problem worth mentioning.

　　Comrades, is the matter really that simple? Please look at a letter from Ouyang Zhuang, a member of the Hu Feng clique, to their leader Hu Feng: "There is a comrade in Suzhou who can be talked to (working in the Municipal Party Committee, a Party member). This person was hit hard in the early days of liberation ('liberalism'), and may have a weaker fighting spirit, but it is worth a try." When a Communist Party member makes a mistake and is criticized by the Party, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique sees this as being "hit hard." If this comrade persists in his errors, they consider him to have a strong "fighting spirit," and they will wave to him, call him "comrade," and try to pull him into their counter-revolutionary clique. This is an important method for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and other counter-revolutionaries to "win over people" and "contact people." The Hu Feng elements seize every opportunity in this regard. When a Party member of the New Literature Publishing House took too much sick leave, which had a bad impact on the masses, and the Party organization offered him some suggestions, the Hu Feng elements immediately came forward to "defend him," expressing "sympathy" to this comrade, and scolding the Party organization for "not treating cadres as human beings" and "it's simply outrageous!" They even seize any opportunity to win over a comrade who has been criticized by his superiors, using sweet words, expressing sympathy, and first launching into a tirade themselves to "enlighten" the other party's dissatisfaction. We must not underestimate these insidious and vicious tactics of the counter-revolutionaries. Some Communist Party members who are not firm in their stand, have extremely serious individualism, and persist in their errors and are dissatisfied with the Party, are dragged into the water by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in this way. A Party member who had been disciplined during the Three-Anti Campaign was transferred to the New Literature Publishing House. As soon as the Hu Feng elements in the publishing house discovered that this Party member had grievances against the organization, they immediately used their despicable methods. They fabricated stories to sow discord between this Party member and the leadership, saying: "When you were transferred here, Comrade Wu Qiang (then a deputy director of the East China Cultural Department) said, 'Is this kind of person worthy of being an editor!'" "The leaders here know about your problems and have a lot of opinions about you!" When this Party member was criticized at a Party meeting for various mistakes, the Hu Feng element Luo Luo came to express his "sympathy": "There is no warmth in Party life at all, treating a comrade as if he were an enemy. If it were me, I really couldn't stand it!" This Party member who was unwilling to correct his mistakes was thus "won over" by them! The same goes for Lu Li in Tianjin. The Party organization and comrades in his unit had constantly given serious criticism to Lu Li's reactionary literary ideas and his ideological and moral errors. However, Lu Li always resisted the Party's criticism, was dissatisfied with the Party, and felt that the Party did not "respect" him or "understand" him. Hu Feng and his followers took the opportunity to attack. The Party and comrades criticized Lu Li's poems for having anti-people tendencies, and criticized Lu Li for not going deep into life. However, Hu Feng and his followers praised Lu Li as a "poet who has reached international standards," saying that his poems are "simple flowers, each with its own fragrance and color..." For Lu Li, who persisted in his errors, the "support" of the Hu Feng elements certainly sounded much "warmer" than the Party's serious criticism! Therefore, he regarded Hu Feng as his "soulmate," often saying "Hu Feng respects my labor, and I also respect him"; on the contrary, he thought that the Party and comrades were too "cold and ruthless" towards them, so he gradually became estranged from the Party, gradually hated the Party, and eventually was pulled over by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Do not think that this kind of problem only occurs in the cultural circles. If counter-revolutionaries want to develop their reactionary organizations, they must use all their ingenuity to find objects. All Communist Party members who have made mistakes but persist in not correcting them will be regarded as "comrades" to be "won over" and "contacted." Lin Qiurong (a Communist Party member), the militia instructor of Huangshi Township, Zaotou District, Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, had very serious individualistic ideas and complained that the superiors did not promote him. The counter-revolutionary Wang Zhengman seized on this weakness to sow discord, saying: "You will never get ahead doing this kind of thing," and lured him to collude with bad elements in embezzlement and corruption, eventually joining the reactionary organization of counter-revolutionaries.

　　Communist Party members need the Party organization to give them care and love. Our Party organization is precisely very concerned about its members. The Party organization's care and love for its members is to enable them to better and faster transform themselves, improve themselves, and grow up healthily; Communist Party members need the Party's care and love to gain strength from the Party's embrace and gradually transform and train themselves into a true advanced fighter of the working class. Therefore, this kind of love and care can only be guidance, help, and encouragement in work, study, and life, as well as strict criticism of shortcomings and errors, and cannot be the petty-bourgeois "tenderness" and unprincipled indulgence and leniency. It is always difficult for a person to avoid making mistakes. When a person makes a mistake, only when the Party organization gives him a "stern warning," gives him severe criticism and even punishment, and points out to him the way to correct his mistakes, can he be helped in time to correct his mistakes, so that he can learn from his mistakes and be tempered and improved in the process of recognizing and correcting his mistakes. However, strict criticism is not something that everyone is happy to accept. As the saying goes, "Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, and good medicine tastes bitter." For many people, criticism does not cause the same pleasant feeling as being praised. A Communist Party member who is firm in his stand and wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause of the Party, when he makes a mistake and is criticized and punished, although he will feel pain and heaviness, his pain and heaviness is first of all because his mistake has caused losses to the Party. In order to recover the Party's losses and to transform himself, even if receiving criticism is not a pleasant thing, they still have the courage to accept it and resolutely correct their mistakes, and become a good Communist Party member again. Therefore, they also regard the Party's severe criticism as true warmth and love, and will not feel that the Party organization is "cold and ruthless." They understand that once a person is sick, he can only endure all the pain in the treatment process to regain his health; when they make mistakes, the Party is the doctor who treats the illness and saves people with a high degree of care and sympathy for people. In our Party, thousands of outstanding Communist Party members have grown up in this kind of love and care from the Party. There are also some Communist Party members who have a different view of love and care. When they make mistakes and are criticized by the Party organization and comrades, they think that the Party organization and comrades are "cold and ruthless." They will have a lot of dissatisfaction and alienation from the Party organization and comrades. This is because these comrades are considering the problem from the standpoint of individualism. They are unwilling to consider the losses that their mistakes have brought to the Party and the people, but only consider that the Party's criticism and punishment have violated their personal interests and damaged their dignity. Therefore, they adhere to the standpoint of individualism, resist criticism, and persist in their mistakes. In their view, no matter when, whether they have done a good job or made mistakes, the Party organization can only give praise and praise, and can only let them handle things according to their own wishes, and comrades can only say what they want to hear. Obviously, this kind of "warmth" and "care" cannot be found in our Party organization. The more the Party organization needs to give a "stern warning" to this kind of unhealthy and disease-evading person, to make them realize that their illness is already very serious. Because small diseases that are not treated will become major diseases, and small mistakes that are not corrected will lead to major mistakes. If the Party organization indulges such Party members, it is irresponsible to the Party. Where is this kind of "warmth" and "care"? Apart from the mutual "comfort" of those who have the same problems and the "resonance" given by those serious liberals, only those hidden counter-revolutionaries with ulterior motives are most willing to give them this kind of "warmth" and "sympathy." What is this "warmth" and "care"? That is just poison wrapped in sugar. Comrades must be deeply vigilant. If you are once captured by this kind of "warmth" and "care," you will either fall into deeper mistakes or break away from the Party and betray the Party and throw yourself into the arms of counter-revolutionaries.

　　A Party member who is loyal to the Party and willing to solemnly fulfill his obligations to the Party and the masses will inevitably have the courage to accept criticism and correct mistakes. They are happy to accept the severe criticism of the Party and the masses, dare to face their own mistakes, are good at correcting mistakes in a timely and sincere manner, constantly learn from mistakes, and constantly exercise and improve themselves, so that they gradually become an excellent Communist Party member and a mature Marxist. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "In many cases, cadres who have made mistakes are not worse than cadres who have not made mistakes, as long as they truly understand their mistakes and correct them, they may be better than cadres who have not made mistakes and can serve the people better." This is the Party's view of those comrades who have made mistakes but truly recognize and correct them. Comrades should also treat their mistakes with this attitude. If you do not take this path, those hidden counter-revolutionaries with ulterior motives will be very happy, will wave and call to you, and will try their best to pull you to another path—the path of counter-revolution!

　　需要什么样的关怀
　　宋琤
    在我们党内，有些同志犯了错误受到党的批评处分后，不是认真地改正错误，而是对党组织不满，觉得党组织内缺少“温暖”和“关怀”，党组织“委曲”了他，对他“冷酷无情”等等。这些同志既然满腹怨气，就总想找上一个两个“知己”，发泄一下自己的牢骚和不满，从“知己”那里得到一些“温暖”和“安慰”。在他们看来这不过是在同志们面前发发牢骚，得到别人一点“同情”，至多不过是自由主义而已，算不得什么了不起的严重问题。
    同志们，事情果真就是这么简单吗？请看胡风集团分子欧阳庄给他们的头子胡风的一封信：“苏州有一个同志可谈（在市委工作，党员），此人在解放初期受了打击（‘自由主义’），可能斗志较差，但可一试。”共产党员犯了错误，受到党的批评，胡风反革命集团就认为这是“受了打击”。如果这位同志坚持错误，他们就认为是很有“斗志”，就要向他招手，称他为“同志”，想办法把他拉到自己的反革命集团中来。这正是胡风反革命集团以及其他反革命分子“争取人”、“联络人”的一个重要办法。胡风分子在这方面是见空子就要钻的。新文艺出版社一个党员因为请病假过多，在群众中影响不好，党组织对他提了一点意见，胡风分子就马上来“打抱不平”，向这位同志表示“同情”，骂党组织“不把干部当一回事”、“真是岂有此理”！甚至只要看到一个同志受到领导上的批评，他们就要来趁机拉拢，甜言蜜语，表示同情，自己先发上一通牢骚，以“启发”对方的不满情绪。我们千万不能轻视反革命分子的这一套阴险毒辣的手段。有一些立场不坚定、个人主义极端严重而又坚持错误对党不满的共产党员，就是这样被胡风反革命集团拖下水去的。一个三反中受过处分的党员调到新文艺出版社了，社内的胡风分子一发现这个党员对组织有不满情绪，立刻就施展开他们的卑鄙手段。他们无中生有地挑拨这个党员同领导的关系说：“你调到这里来时，吴强同志（当时华东文化部的一位副处长）说‘这样的人也配去当编辑吗！’”“这里领导上知道你的问题，对你很有意见！”当这个党员因为种种错误在党的会议上受到批评的时候，胡风分子罗洛就来向他表“同情”：“党内生活没有一点温暖，对待一个同志好像对待敌人一样。要是我，那真受不了！”这个不愿改正错误的党员就这样被他们“争取”过去了！天津的鲁藜也是这样。他所在单位的党组织和同志们曾经对鲁藜的反动的文艺思想以及他思想品质方面的错误不断地给予严正的批评。鲁藜却始终抗拒党的批评，对党不满，认为党不“尊重”他、不“了解”他。胡风和他的喽啰们就乘机进攻。党和同志们批评鲁藜的诗有反人民的倾向，批评鲁藜不深入生活，胡风和胡风分子却把鲁藜捧为“达到国际标准的诗人”，说他的诗是“朴素的花朵，每一朵都有它的香气和色彩……”。对于坚持错误的鲁藜说来，胡风分子们的“捧场”，听起来当然要比党的严正的批评“温暖”得多！于是，就把胡风当成他的“知音”，常说“胡风尊重我的劳动，我也尊重他”；相反地认为党和同志们对他们太“冷酷无情”，于是逐渐对党疏远，逐渐对党仇恨，终至于被胡风反革命集团拉了过去。不要以为这种问题只会发生在文化界，反革命分子要发展他们的反动组织，就一定要用尽心计地去物色对象。一切犯有错误而又坚持不改的共产党员，都会被他们当做“同志”去“争取”“联络”的。江西省上饶县皂头区黄市乡的民兵指导员林裘荣（共产党员）个人主义思想非常严重，埋怨上级不提拔。反革命分子王正满就抓住他的这一弱点从中挑拨，说什么：“干这名堂一世也不能出头”，拉拢他和坏分子们在一起贪污腐化，终至参加了反革命分子的反动组织。
    共产党员是需要党组织给予关怀和爱护的。我们的党组织也正是十分关怀自己的党员。党组织关怀和爱护自己的党员，是为了让他们更好地更快地改造自己，提高自己，使他们健康地成长起来；共产党员需要党的关怀和爱护，是要从党的怀抱里取得力量，把自己逐渐地改造锻炼成一个真正的工人阶级的先进战士。因此，这种爱护和关怀就只能是工作、学习以及生活上的指导帮助和鼓舞以及对于缺点错误的严格的批评，而不能是小资产阶级的“温情”和无原则的纵容姑息。一个人总是难免要犯错误的。当一个人犯了错误时，只有党组织向他“大喝一声”，给予严厉的批评以至处分，指给他改正错误的办法，才能及时地帮助他改正错误，使他在认识和改正错误的过程中吸取教训受到锻炼而有所进步提高。但是，严格的批评并不是每一个人都乐于接受的。俗话说，“忠言逆耳，良药苦口”，对于很多人来说，批评是不会引起像被表扬时的那种愉快的感觉的。一个立场坚定全心全意地献身给党的事业的共产党员，在犯了错误受到批评处分时，虽然也会感到痛苦和沉重，但是他的痛苦和沉重首先是因为自己的错误给党造成了损失。为了挽回党的损失，为了改造自己，纵然受批评不是愉快的事情，他们也还是勇于接受并坚决改正错误，重新做一个好的共产党员的。因此，他们也就把党的严厉的批评当成真正的温暖和爱护，而不会感到党组织“冷酷无情”。他们懂得，一个人既然生了病，就只有忍受治疗过程中的一切痛苦，才能重新恢复健康；当他们犯了错误时，党对他们就是具有对人的高度关怀和同情的治病救人的医生。在我们党内，成千上万的优秀的共产党员，就是在党的这种爱护和关怀中成长起来的。也还有一些共产党员，他们对爱护和关怀另有一种看法。当他们犯了错误受到党组织和同志们的批评时，他们就认为是党组织和同志“冷酷无情”。他们对党组织和同志就会有很大的不满和疏远。这是因为这些同志是站在个人主义的立场上来考虑问题的。他们不愿意考虑自己的错误给党和人民带来的损失，而只考虑到党的批评、处分触犯了他们个人的利益，损伤了他们的尊严，因而就坚持个人主义的立场，抗拒批评，坚持错误。在他们看来，不论什么时候，不管是他们做好了工作或犯了错误，党组织都只能给以夸奖称赞，只能让他们顺着自己的意思去办事，同志们也只能说他们愿意听的话。很明显地，在我们的党组织内是找不到这样的“温暖”和“关怀”的。越是对这种不健康的而又讳疾忌医的人，党组织越要向他“大喝一声”，要他们认识自己的病已经很重。因为小病不治就要成为大病，小错不改，就要铸成大错，党组织如果对这样的党员纵容姑息，就是对党不负责任。那里有这种
  “温暖”和“关怀”呢，除了犯有同样毛病的人互相“安慰”和那些严重的自由主义者给以“共鸣”外，就只有像胡风分子这样的别有用心的暗藏反革命分子最愿意给他们以这种“温暖”和“同情”。这种“温暖”和“关怀”是什么呢，那只是包着糖衣的毒药。同志们要深深地警惕啊，如果你一旦被这种“温暖”和“关怀”俘掳了去，不是陷入更深的错误，就是脱离党背叛党而投入反革命分子的怀抱。
    一个对党忠诚、愿意严肃地履行自己对党对群众所负义务的党员，必然会有接受批评改正错误的勇气。他们乐于接受党和群众的严厉的批评，敢于正视自己的错误，善于及时地诚恳地改正错误，不断地从错误中吸取教训，不断地锻炼和提高自己，使自己逐渐成为一个优秀的共产党员，一个成熟的马克思主义者。刘少奇同志说过：“在许多情形下，犯过错误的干部并不比没有犯过错误的干部更坏，只要他真正了解错误，改正错误，他可能比没有犯过错误的干部更好，更能为人民服务。”这就是党对那些犯了错误但是真正认识错误改正错误的同志们的看法。同志们也应该用这种态度来对待自己的错误。如果不走这一条路，那些别有用心的暗藏的各种反革命分子就会大为高兴，就会向你招手呼唤，就会用尽办法想把你拉到另一条路——反革命的路上去！
