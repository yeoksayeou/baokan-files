The Changning District of Shanghai, under the unified deployment of the Municipal People's Committee, began implementing grain rationing by household in mid-May, and the district's grain sales volume decreased somewhat compared to April. However, because the publicity work on saving grain was not deep or thorough enough at the time, the general public did not sufficiently recognize the great significance of saving grain, and there were still some ideological concerns when formulating plans. Some residents believed that a larger plan would allow for flexibility, while a tight plan would cause trouble later, fearing that it would be discounted when submitted, etc. Therefore, residents' grain consumption plans were generally 15% to 20% higher than necessary. For example, the Fanhua Ferry Road Office investigated the grain consumption plans of 70 industrial worker families, 15 staff members, and 47 stall vendors, and found that they were generally about 15% higher than necessary, with some serious cases being as high as 60% to 70%. In order to eliminate waste and further reduce grain sales, the district conducted a verification of residents' grain consumption plans in June. Pilot work was carried out in early June. After June 15th, grain consumption plans were verified in batches among residents throughout the district by residents' committee members and group leaders reaching out to the masses. In the Sunjiazhai East Section pilot area of the district, after verification, 411 households' grain consumption plans were found to be relatively realistic and did not need to be reduced; 221 households' plans were found to be too high and were reduced. The original planned grain consumption was 27,195 jin, which was reduced to 22,424 jin after verification, a decrease of more than 17%, generally 15% to 20% lower than the original plan, and even more in some cases.

    When the household rationing work came to an end, the staff of the grain work team (more than half of whom were transferred from district-level agencies) generally developed a sense of relaxation and complacency. In response to this situation, the district's leading staff conducted work summaries and mobilization for the plan verification work among the work teams, pointing out the shortcomings of the generally inflated grain consumption plans of residents, and explaining the principles of the plan verification work: "Practice strict economy, eliminate waste, be meticulous in calculations, be realistic and pragmatic, so as to ensure reasonable supply." Then arrangements were made for investigation and fact-finding: First, find out the actual grain consumption, and calculate three accounts: one is to conduct investigations and fact-finding among typical households, analyze the grain consumption standards of people of different classes and different ages, and the situation of general residents' grain consumption plans being too high, as a reference for verifying plans. The second is to calculate the overall account, based on the overall task requirements and the investigation and fact-finding materials in various regions, propose the approximate numbers and percentages that can be reduced as indicators. The third is to verify the grain consumption plans of residents' committee members and residents' group leaders, calculate accounts, and then study and sort residents' grain consumption plans. Second, understand the thoughts of the masses of all classes, so as to carry out education in light of the actual ideological situation of the masses.

    In the process of investigation and fact-finding in pilot areas and general areas, many work team members had conservative ideas such as "although it is a bit high, the number is not large" and "it won't work if it's calculated too tightly." Therefore, the preliminary investigation materials were still too lenient, and there was a lack of confidence in the 20% reduction target proposed by the leadership. This conservative thinking was only broken after repeated investigations and the factual education of verification in the pilot areas. For example, staff members of the Wuyi Road Office went down to investigate a residents' committee member's grain consumption, and after a rough calculation, they believed that it could not be reduced any further, and expressed wavering in adhering to the principle of verification. Later, with the help of leading comrades, the account was calculated, and the possibility of reducing the plan was pointed out. At the same time, the residents' committee member, who was considered unable to reduce any further, automatically proposed to reduce 20 jin, which profoundly educated the staff member and strengthened his confidence in his work.

    Before the work was fully promoted to the neighborhoods, the district's leading staff summarized the experiences of the pilot areas, overcoming the fear of difficulties that was relatively common among the staff. After investigation, accounting, and repeated education, most of the staff improved their understanding, became familiar with the policies, and clarified the working methods and steps. Ideological preparation was made for the comprehensive launch of the household grain consumption plan verification work.

    When the household grain consumption plan verification work was officially launched, the entire work was carried out in two steps: The first step was to verify the grain consumption plans of the residents' committee members and group leaders, and at the same time, to train them to become models of saving grain. The second step was to rely on residents' committee members and group leaders to verify the grain consumption plans of the masses in batches. In the work, the policy of patient persuasion, relying on the active, uniting the middle, and promoting the backward, starting with the easy and then the difficult was adhered to. The methods of combining large-scale reports, small group discussions, typical introductions, mutual assistance in accounting, and individual visits were used to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological education. Then, on the basis of raising ideological awareness and dispelling concerns, the masses were mobilized to consciously revise their grain consumption plans. The specific methods were:

    1. Carry out education in light of the masses' thoughts: On the basis of preliminary investigation and accounting, the achievements of the household rationing work were affirmed, and the shortcomings of the plan being too high and serious waste were also pointed out. The important significance of saving grain was further explained, the reasons and harms of the plan being too high were analyzed, and residents' committee members and group leaders were called upon to verify the grain consumption plan, play a leading role, and set an example for the masses. In small group discussions, residents' committee members and group leaders generally could relate to their own experiences and realize the importance of saving grain. Some also recalled their lives before liberation and made comparisons. This solved the original thinking that it was okay for the plan to be a little higher, and generally admitted that the plan being too high was a fact, and expressed their willingness to be meticulous in calculations and verify the plan.

    Some residents' committee members and group leaders supported the principle of verifying the grain consumption plan in theory, but still had many concerns. Some thought that this work would be difficult to do and lacked confidence; some were not in charge of the household and were concerned that their families would not agree; some had sentimental views and were afraid of being scolded by the masses if they were too strict; some thought that the plan was not too high and there would not be much to reduce; a few did not agree with the idea and were unwilling to modify the plan. According to this situation, they were repeatedly given supplementary education; and family work was strengthened in conjunction with individual assistance. After such publicity and mobilization, most residents' committee members and residents' group leaders began to consciously verify the plan. For example, Zhu Zhifa, the sanitation deputy director of a three-wheeled vehicle worker, had a family of five and originally planned to use 165 jin. After listening to the first report, he said that he could reduce half a jin per day and was willing to reduce 15 jin per month. After listening to the second report, he went back and recalculated carefully and reduced another 15 jin per month. After an individual conversation, he was inspired by his responsibility as the head of the family through recalling the past and making comparisons. Finally, the plan was verified to be 123 jin.

    Among the residents, after ideological investigation, there were roughly the following situations: (1) They thought that their plan was not too high, and it was convenient to have a larger plan. (2) They doubted the policy and were afraid of "tightening step by step," worrying that they would not have enough to eat in the future. (3) They did not agree with the idea of verifying the plan and thought that the government was being too strict. A few residents expressed antagonism towards verifying the plan emotionally, and a few residents knew that the grain consumption plan would be reduced and instead applied to increase the supply first. In order to get through the residents' thoughts, residents' group meetings were held in a guided manner. Through recalling the past and making comparisons in accounting, the residents' own experiences were used to understand the principle of saving grain and the necessity of verifying the plan, laying the ideological foundation for being meticulous in calculations and verifying the plan.

    2. In-depth deliberation, individual visits, and detailed accounting. After publicity and mobilization, although the residents' understanding of saving grain was somewhat improved, they were still not meticulous enough in calculations when they returned home to verify the plan. Some were afraid of accounting or did not know how to account. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on activists to carry out in-depth deliberation among the masses, help each other in detailed accounting, persuade the masses with facts, and consciously verify the plan. Generally, the following accounts are calculated: one is to calculate the old grain purchase account, deduct the abnormal grain consumption figures, and find out the general grain consumption rules and the average monthly grain consumption. The second is to find out the daily grain consumption under normal grain consumption conditions based on the new grain purchase certificate in June, and thereby obtain the total monthly grain consumption. The third is to calculate the actual daily grain consumption. With reference to these three accounts, a more practical grain consumption figure can be obtained. For example, Zhu Baozhen's family has eight people. According to the first method, the monthly grain consumption is 190 jin; according to the second method, it is 192 jin; and the third method is 186 jin. Therefore, the actual monthly grain consumption of the household should be about 190 jin. When accounting, attention should also be paid to the highest and lowest grain consumption figures, analyze the reasons, and grasp the characteristics of grain consumption in each period. For example, February is the Spring Festival, and the amount of grain consumption is generally large and cannot be used as a normal grain consumption figure. In addition, it is necessary to understand the usual waste situation, the factors that can be saved, the population flow, and the usual standard of living. If the accounts are calculated correctly, the masses can be effectively persuaded.

    3. Organize the masses to carry out self-education. After listening to reports and small group discussions, some of the masses' ideological concerns were still not eliminated. At this time, the method of advanced people leading the backward was generally used, and it was very effective. For example, most of the residents in Wujiaochang, Fanhua Ferry, are shops and stall vendors, and the amount of grain consumption is too high. Some of the average per capita consumption is as high as 36 jin, and not much was reduced after mobilization. After research, the main ideological concern of the masses was that they were afraid that they would not have enough to eat if they reduced it again, and at the same time, they had the idea of ​​waiting and seeing each other. Therefore, Li Deye, a resident, was cultivated to make a typical speech at the meeting, introducing his own ideological struggle and meticulous calculations for verification, dispelling the concerns of many residents that they would not have enough to eat if the verification was too strict. On the spot, 25 households proposed to reduce the amount, and many people went back and recalculated, which greatly promoted the verification work. In addition, it is also very effective to use the households that have already verified the plan to persuade those that have not yet verified the plan. For example, the stepmother of the deputy director of the Sunjiazhai Residents' Committee insisted on not reducing the plan. Later, through the persuasion of a woman who usually had a good relationship with her, the problem was solved.

    4. Use social forces to conduct education through relevant organizations: For example, the second residents' group of Sunjiazhai has a total of 19 households, of which 18 households are families of tram workers, which has always been a dead corner in neighborhood work. This time, the tram trade union was contacted in advance, and first through the party member Wang Jincai, his mother's thoughts were cleared, and she consciously verified the grain consumption plan, thus opening up the situation. In addition, for individual cases that are difficult to solve, specific analysis must be carried out, and different methods must be adopted according to the specific situation. For individual people who have speculative behavior, and whose grain consumption plan is much higher than necessary, and who have a bad attitude and intentionally resist, they should be exposed to the masses and reduced.

    After the household grain consumption plan verification was initially implemented, the residents were generally satisfied and believed that the verified amount was enough to eat, and the ideological concern that they would "not have enough to eat after verification" has been basically eliminated.

    上海长宁区核实居民用粮计划的工作
    李仲英
    上海市长宁区在市人民委员会的统一部署下，于五月中开始实行粮食按户计划供应，全区粮食销售量比四月份就降低了一些。但是由于当时对节约粮食的宣传工作做得不深不透，一般群众对节约粮食的重大意义认识不足，在制定计划时还有一些思想顾虑。有些居民认为计划大点可以机动，紧了怕以后要麻烦，怕送上去要打折扣等。因此，居民用粮计划普遍偏高百分之十五至二十左右。如梵皇渡路办事处调查了七十户产业工人家属、十五户职员、四十七户摊贩的用粮计划，一般偏高百分之十五左右，严重的甚至偏高达百分之六、七十。为了杜绝浪费，进一步压缩粮食销量，这个区就在六月份进行了居民用粮计划的核实工作。六月初先进行了试点工作，六月十五日后，在全区居民中间，由居民委员、小组长到群众，分批核实了用粮计划。这个区孙家宅东段试点地区居民的用粮计划，经核实后，计划较切合实际不必核减的共四百十一户；计划偏高经核减的有二百二十一户，用粮数量原计划为二万七千一百九十五斤，核减后下降为二万二千四百二十四斤，减少了百分之十七以上，一般比原计划降低了百分之十五至二十，有的更多。
    在按户计划供应工作告一段落时，粮食工作队的工作人员（有半数以上是由区级机关抽调的）普遍产生了松劲思想和自满情绪。针对这种情况，区的领导工作人员在工作队中进行了工作总结和核实计划工作的动员，指出了居民用粮计划普遍偏高的缺点，交代了“厉行节约，杜绝浪费，精打细算，实事求是，以保证合理供应”的核实计划工作原则。接着对调查摸底工作作了布置：第一、摸清实际用粮的底，算三笔账：一是根据典型户调查摸底，分析不同阶层、不同年龄的人的粮食消费标准和一般居民用粮计划偏高的情况，以作为核实计划的参考。二是算大账，根据总的任务要求和各地区调查摸底材料，提出大体可以降低的数字和百分比作为指标。三是核实居民委员、居民组长的用粮计划，进行算账，然后对居民的用粮计划进行研究排队。第二、摸清各阶层群众的思想，以便能针对群众的实际思想情况，进行教育。
    在试点地区和一般地区的摸底过程中，不少工作队人员有“虽有偏高，但数字不大”“算紧了搞不通”的保守思想。因此，初步摸底的材料仍然偏松，对领导方面提出的核减百分之二十的指标缺乏信心。后经反复摸底和试点地区核实的事实教育，这种保守思想才被打破。如武夷路办事处工作人员下去摸一居民委员用粮的底，只是粗粗一算，就认为无法再减，对坚持贯彻核实原则表示动摇。后经领导同志帮助算账，指出降低计划的可能性，同时这个被认为无法再减的居民委员，自动提出减了二十斤，因而深刻地教育了这个工作人员，坚定了他的工作信心。
    在工作全面推向里弄之前，区的领导工作人员又对试点地区的经验作了总结，克服了在工作人员中比较普遍存在的畏难情绪。经过摸底算账和反复教育，使大部分工作人员提高了认识，熟悉了政策，明确了工作方法步骤。为按户核实用粮计划工作的全面推开，做好了思想准备。
    在按户核实用粮计划工作正式推开时，整个工作是分为两步进行的：第一步是核实居民委员和小组长的用粮计划，同时对他们进行了训练，使他们成为节约用粮的模范。第二步，依靠居民委员和小组长分批核实群众的用粮计划。在工作中坚持了耐心说服，依靠积极，团结中间，推动落后，先易后难的方针。运用大会报告、小组座谈、典型介绍和互助算账、个别访问相结合的办法，进行了深入细致的思想教育。然后在提高思想觉悟解除顾虑的基础上，发动群众自觉地修订了用粮计划。具体做法是：
    一、针对群众思想进行教育：在初步摸底算账的基础上，肯定了按户计划供应工作的成绩，同时也指出计划偏高和浪费严重的缺点，进一步说明节约粮食的重要意义，分析了计划偏高的原因和危害，号召居民委员和小组长核实用粮计划，起带头作用，为群众树立榜样。在小组讨论中，居民委员和小组长一般都能联系自己切身体验，认识节约粮食的重要。有的还回忆解放前的生活，进行了对比。解决了原来认为计划高点没啥的思想，一般的都承认计划偏高是事实，表示愿意精打细算，核实计划。
    有部分居民委员和小组长对核实用粮计划道理上拥护，但还有不少顾虑。有的认为这次工作难搞，缺乏信心；有的自己不当家，顾虑家属思想打不通；有的有情面观点，怕抓得紧了，会被群众骂；有的则认为偏高不大，要核减的不多；个别的则思想不通，不愿修改计划。根据这个情况，对他们又反复进行了补课教育；并结合个别帮助，加强了家属工作。经过这样的宣传动员，大部分居民委员和居民小组长开始自觉地核实了计划。如三轮工人治安副主任朱志发，一家五口原订计划一百六十五斤，听了第一次报告后，表示每天可减半斤，每月愿核减十五斤，听了第二次报告后，回去再细算，每月又核减了十五斤，后经过个别谈话，进行回忆对比，启发了他当家作主的责任感，最后核实为一百二十三斤。
    在居民群众中，经过思想摸底，大致有以下几种情况：（1）认为自己计划偏高不大，计划打大点方便。（2）对政策怀疑，怕“步步紧”，耽心以后不够吃。（3）对核实计划思想不通，认为政府抓得太紧。有个别居民对核实计划情绪上表示对抗，也有个别居民知道要核减用粮计划，反而先来申请增加供应。为了打通居民群众的思想，有领导地召开了居民小组会。通过回忆对比算账，用群众的切身体验来领会节约粮食的道理和核实计划的必要，为精打细算，核实计划打下了思想基础。
    二、深入酝酿，个别访问，算细账。经过宣传动员后，居民群众虽则对节约粮食认识有所提高，但回家核实时，精打细算仍然不够。有的怕算账，或不会算账。因此必须依靠积极分子在群众中进行深入的酝酿，互助算细账，以事实说服群众，自觉核实计划。一般是算这样几笔账：一是算旧购粮的账，扣除不正常的用粮数字，摸出一般的用粮规律和每月平均用粮数。二是根据六月份的新购粮证，找出正常用粮情况下每天用粮数，并由此求得每月用粮总数。三是计算出每天的实际用粮数。参照这三笔账，就得出较近实际的用粮数。如居民朱宝珍家八口人，按第一种算法，得出每月用粮是一百九十斤；根据第二种算法是一百九十二斤；第三种算法是一百八十六斤。因此，该户的每月实际用粮数应是一百九十斤左右。在算账时并应注意最高和最低用粮数，分析原因，掌握每一时期用粮的特点。如二月是春节，一般用粮数量较大不能作为正常用粮数。另外必须了解平时浪费情况、可能节约的因素、人口流动情况以及平时生活水平。账算得正确，就能有力地说服群众。
    三、组织群众进行自我教育。在听报告和小组讨论后，部分群众思想顾虑仍未消除。这时，普遍运用了先进带动落后的方法，收效很大。如梵皇渡五角场居民大部为商店及摊贩，用粮数偏高，有的大小口平均达三十六斤，经过动员核减不多。经过研究，群众的主要思想顾虑是怕再减了会吃不饱，同时有相互观望的思想。于是培养了居民李德炎在会上作典型发言，介绍了他自己思想斗争和精打细算进行核实的经过，解除了不少居民怕核得太紧吃不饱的顾虑。当场就有二十五户提出减低，不少群众回去后重新算账，大大推动了核实工作。另外，运用已经核实计划的户劝说尚未核实的，也有很大的作用。如孙家宅居民委员会副主任的后母，坚持不肯核减计划，后通过和她平时感情较好的妇女出面劝说，解决了问题。
    四、运用社会力量，通过有关组织进行教育：如孙家宅第二居民小组，共十九户，其中十八户为电车工人家属，一向为里弄工作死角，这次事先和电车工会进行了联系，首先通过党员王金财，打通了他母亲的思想，自觉将用粮计划核实，因而打开了局面。此外对于个别较难解决的，必须进行具体分析，根据具体情况，采取不同办法。对于个别有投机行为和用粮计划偏高很多、态度恶劣有意对抗者，则在群众中进行揭发，加以核减。
    初步实现按户核实用粮计划后，居民一般都很满意，认为核实后的数量够吃，怕“核实后不够吃”的思想顾虑已基本解除。
