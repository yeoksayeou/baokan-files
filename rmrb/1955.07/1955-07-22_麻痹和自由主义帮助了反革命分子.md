    Complacency and Liberalism Help Counter-Revolutionaries
    Wang Zhongfang
    Recently, newspapers have continuously published news of cracking down on counter-revolutionary cases in various places. The revealed facts all prove that our people's complacency and liberalism are convenient conditions for counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities.
    The "People's Daily" published on July 5 the Guangdong Provincial People's Court's recent trial of a Kuomintang secret agent organization that had infiltrated internal organs to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage—the "Kuomintang Central Committee Sixth Group South China Working Committee Yue-Sui District Work Station Intelligence Group." The principal offender, Wang Dizhong, was the leader of this "Intelligence Group." He used deceptive means to infiltrate the Guangdong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau Design Company and became a first-level technician. He used various methods to carry out many sabotage activities. An important sabotage activity was the secret collection of more than 20 pieces of intelligence on our military, political, and engineering aspects and secretly sent them to the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's spy agency in Hong Kong. Most of the more than 20 pieces of intelligence obtained by the special agent Wang Dizhong, except for a few that were obtained from his own handling of several engineering designs by virtue of his position, were obtained by taking advantage of our people's complacency and liberalism.
    The intelligence reported by the counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's spy agency in Hong Kong involved our important engineering design situations with defense significance. He himself did not participate in the design of these projects. How did he know about them? It turned out that complacency and liberalism helped. Because the design drawings of the design projects undertaken by this design company were not handled by special personnel, nor were there any confidentiality systems, everyone could read them casually. People in the company, including responsible cadres, thought this way: What's so important about letting everyone look at the design drawings? We don't have any counter-revolutionaries here, what are we afraid of? The facts were just the opposite, and the secrets of those important projects were taken away by the enemy.
    The counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong not only knew many secrets of the design company where he worked, but also, in his report to the spy agency, involved the secrets of some important projects in other places, even in Central South and North China. How did this happen? It turned out that complacency and liberalism were helping him again. Because this design company often had personnel transfers due to national engineering needs, these transfers were casually mentioned in a serious atmosphere of complacency and liberalism, and there was no confidentiality at all. For example, if a technician was to be transferred to a certain important or even highly confidential project in a certain place, everyone would know about it. Unintentional people just knew that so-and-so was going to work somewhere; intentional counter-revolutionaries would obtain intelligence about a certain important project being built somewhere. What was even worse was that these complacent and liberal people who were transferred to new jobs would write letters reporting on the situation, expressing too much enthusiasm in their letters, to the point that they unreservedly wrote down state secrets. Unintentional people were excited to see the great construction of the motherland; intentional counter-revolutionaries felt like "searching high and low, finding nothing; it came easily without any effort." The counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong used this method to obtain more than one important piece of intelligence.
    The design company also had technicians transferred from other places, which were also not to be missed by counter-revolutionaries. Hainan Island is a frontier of national defense, and the situation in this area is naturally more needed by the spy agency. The counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong tried to win over a technician transferred from the Haikou City Construction Company, and this complacent and liberal person supplied the counter-revolutionary with a lot of valuable secrets, such as where certain projects were being built, how they were being built, where naval barracks were being built, and other defense secrets.
    From the intelligence given by the counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong to the spy agency, we can also see how much the spy agency valued our exhibitions and newspapers and periodicals. For example, the counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong learned a lot of important information from the "Central South Design Exhibition" in Hankou in 1954. After visiting the exhibition, he prepared to report eight items of intelligence about the Yangtze River Iron Bridge, shipyard, etc. to the spy agency, but he was arrested by the People's Public Security organs before he had time to send them out. Some of our exhibitions and newspapers and periodicals do have a phenomenon of not paying attention to keeping state secrets, which is very alarming.
    On the train from Wuhan back to Guangzhou, the counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong met three volunteer army personnel. After Wang Dizhong feigned "intimacy," the conversation became quite enthusiastic, including the following dialogue: "Where are you from?" One volunteer army replied: "Returning from Korea." "Where are you going?" One volunteer army replied: "Going to ××, our brigade has already arrived at ××, we are logistics personnel." "Is your brigade all at ××?" "No, not all at ××, some are also at ×× and ××." Readers can easily understand the significance of such a conversation to a counter-revolutionary who intends to gather information about our army. The counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong went to a certain place to "work" and saw some warships. Wang Dizhong wanted to find out which department the navy here belonged to. Soon he obtained this information. It was a cadre from a local native products company who told him. Was this cadre of the native products company a counter-revolutionary? No, he was not, and could even be said to be a very good person. It turned out that Wang Dizhong was walking back and forth in front of the gate of our naval organ, asking people, and a cadre of the native products company kindly told him that this was "Department ××." The above three volunteer army personnel and this cadre of the native products company might say:
  "Who knew that the person asking the question was a counter-revolutionary?" But we can also say: Is it permissible to casually tell people about the movements of the army and the serial numbers of military organs?
    The counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong also obtained a secret document on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and sent it to the Hong Kong spy agency. This document was kept by a party member cadre, how did it get into the hands of the counter-revolutionary? It turned out that this party member cadre had serious problems with complacency and liberalism, and did not keep the secret document properly in his dormitory, so it was stolen by the counter-revolutionary. Regarding this fact, if you say that the person who committed complacency and liberalism gave the secret document to the counter-revolutionary, what is wrong with that!
    Now the counter-revolutionary Wang Dizhong has been sentenced to death by the Guangdong Provincial Court, and the people have eliminated him. However, there are still many hidden counter-revolutionaries like Wang Dizhong who have not been eliminated and are still carrying out various sabotage activities in every corner.
    In order to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, we must vigorously correct complacency and liberalism, and implement a "strengthen the walls and clear the fields" policy against all hidden counter-revolutionaries, so that they have no loopholes to exploit.

    麻痹和自由主义帮助了反革命分子
    王仲方
    最近报纸上连续登载了各地破获反革命案件的消息，从已揭露的事实来看，都证明了我们的人麻痹和自由主义，是反革命分子得以进行破坏活动的便利条件。
    七月五日“人民日报”公布了广东省人民法院最近审判了一个混入机关内部进行反革命破坏的蒋贼特务组织——“国民党中央委员会第六组华南工作委员会粤穗区工作站情报组”的案件。主犯王砥中是这个“情报组”的组长。他用欺骗的手段，混进了广东省建筑工程局设计公司，当了一级技术员。利用各种各样的方法，进行了许多破坏活动。其中重要的破坏活动是先后搜集了我们的军事、政治、工程等各方面的情报共二十多件，秘密送给香港蒋介石卖国集团的特务机关。特务王砥中所取得的二十多件情报，除了少数情报是利用本身职务，从他自己经办的几种工程设计情况中得来的以外，大多数都是利用我们的人麻痹和自由主义取得的。
    反革命分子王砥中向香港蒋介石卖国集团特务机关报告的情报中，牵涉到我们某些重要的有国防意义的工程设计情况，他本人并没有参加这些工程的设计，他是怎么知道的呢？原来是麻痹和自由主义帮的忙。因为这个设计公司所承办的设计工程的设计图样，没有专人负责，也没有保密的制度，大家都可以随便看。公司的人们包括负责干部在内是这样想的：设计图纸大家看看有什么要紧？我们这里又没有反革命分子，怕什么？事实恰恰相反，那些重要工程的秘密就这样给敌人拿走了。
    反革命分子王砥中不仅知道他所在的设计公司的许多机密，而且在向特务机关的报告中，还牵涉到外地，以至中南、华北等地某些重要工程的秘密，那又是怎么一回事呢？原来又是麻痹和自由主义在帮助他。因为这个设计公司为了全国工程需要，经常有人员调动，在严重的麻痹和自由主义空气里，这些调动都是随便乱说的，根本没有保密。例如一个技术人员要被调到某地某项重要的甚至是很机密的工程上去了，于是大家都知道了。无心的人，只是知道某某人要调到哪里去工作就算了；有意的反革命分子，就从此获得了某地正在建筑某项重要工程的情报。事情比这还要糟糕的，是这些上调的麻痹和自由主义的人们，到了新的工作岗位，还要写信报告情况，在信中表示了过多的热情，以至把国家的机密都毫不吝惜地写在信上。无心的人看了，对祖国的伟大建设感到兴奋；有意的反革命分子看了，真是“踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费功夫”。反革命分子王砥中，就利用了这个方法，取得了不止一件重要情报。
    设计公司也有从外地调进来的技术人员，也是反革命分子不能放过的。海南岛是国防前哨，这个地区的情况自然更为特务机关所需要。反革命分子王砥中向一个海口市建筑公司调来的技术员进行拉拢，于是这个麻痹和自由主义的人，就供给了反革命分子不少有价值的机密，例如在哪里建筑了什么工程啦，建筑得怎么样啦！什么地方又建筑了海军营房啦！以及关于国防的其他机密等等。
    从反革命分子王砥中给特务机关的情报中，还可以看到特务机关是如何重视我们的展览会和报纸书刊，例如反革命分子王砥中从一九五四年汉口“中南设计展览会”上，就了解了不少重要情况，在参观以后，准备向特务机关报告关于长江铁桥，造船厂等的情报有八项之多，只是在他还没有来得及送出之前，就被人民公安机关逮捕了。我们的某些展览会和报纸书刊，确实还有不重视保守国家机密的现象，这是很值得警惕的。
    反革命分子王砥中从武汉回广州，在火车上碰到三个志愿军工作人员。经过王砥中的假作“亲热”，谈话进行得相当热烈，其中包括以下一段对话：“你们从那里来？”有一个志愿军回答：“从朝鲜回来”，“你们到那里去？”有一个志愿军回答：“到××去，我们的大队已经到了××了，我们是后勤人员”，“你们的大队是不是都在××？”“不，不都在××，也有在××和××的”。读者不难了解，这样的谈话，对于一个蓄意探取我军情报的反革命分子，有什么意义。反革命分子王砥中到某地“工作”，看到一些军舰，王砥中想刺探这里海军是那个部分的。不久他就获得了这个情况。是当地土产公司的一个干部告诉他的。这个土产公司的干部是反革命分子吗？不，不是的，甚至还可以说是个大大的好人。原来王砥中在我海军机关门口走来走去，向人打听，土产公司某干部就关心地告诉了他，这里是“××部”。以上这三位志愿军的工作人员和这位土产公司的干部也许会说：
  “谁知道这问话的是反革命分子呢？”可是我们也可以说：难道军队的行动和军事机关的番号是可以随便告诉人的吗？
    反革命分子王砥中还取得了一本关于镇压反革命问题的秘密文件寄往香港特务机关。这份文件是一个党员干部保存的，怎么会到了反革命分子手上呢？原来这个党员干部有着严重的麻痹和自由主义的毛病，把秘密文件放在宿舍里也不好好保存，就给反革命分子偷走了。对于这种事实，你要说是犯了麻痹和自由主义的人把秘密文件送给了反革命分子，又有什么不可以呢！
    现在反革命分子王砥中已经被广东省法院判处死刑，人民已经把他消灭了。可是像王砥中这样暗藏的反革命分子，还有不少没有肃清，还在各个角落进行着各种破坏活动。
    为了肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，我们必须大力纠正麻痹和自由主义，对一切暗藏的反革命分子实行“坚壁清野”的工作，使他们无空子可钻。
