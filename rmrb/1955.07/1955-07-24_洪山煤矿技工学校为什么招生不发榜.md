To the Editor:

    This past April, the Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School, under the Huadong Coal Mining Bureau, conducted an entrance examination in Huainan City. More than 500 people applied, some of whom came from afar from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other places.

    Strangely, it has been three months since the examination, and there is still no news of the "results being announced." We wrote to the Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School to inquire, and the school replied: "After our school conducted the examination in Huainan City this time, we received an order from the Huainan Municipal People's Committee requiring our school to hand over all the exam papers to the government. After discussions with the person in charge of the Huainan Mining Bureau and with the consent of the Huadong Coal Mining Bureau, all candidates in the Huainan area will not be admitted. As for the follow-up explanation, the Huainan Mining Bureau should be responsible for the explanation…." We then went to the Personnel Department of the Huainan Mining Bureau to inquire, and they said "they didn't know about this matter" and refused to explain or handle it. Finally, we wrote to the Huainan Municipal Labor Bureau asking them to negotiate this matter for us, and the reply we received was: "This matter has nothing to do with our bureau and should be handled by the Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School."

    Editor, what exactly is going on? The Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School publicly recruits students, but why is there no follow-up after the exam? We are waiting for a responsible reply from the school. Jing Rongsheng, et al.

    Editor's Note: The reason why the Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School did not announce the admission results, as investigated by the "Huainan Miner's News" entrusted by this newspaper, is as follows: This school privately recruited students in the city without the formal consent of the Huainan Municipal Labor Bureau in early April this year, resulting in a large influx of young people and farmers from various places into Huainan City. After the Huainan Municipal People's Committee discovered this, it requested the school to stop recruiting students, but the staff responsible for handling the recruitment ignored it. Therefore, the Huainan Municipal People's Committee decided to detain all the exam papers and wait for the school to complete the formalities before taking them away. However, the school adopted the method of "not admitting any candidates from Huainan City," attempting to shirk responsibility. We believe that the attitude of the Hongshan Coal Mine Technical School is very wrong. The Huadong Coal Mining Bureau should investigate and deal with this issue, and earnestly and responsibly do a good job in the follow-up work of this recruitment.

### 洪山煤矿技工学校为什么招生不发榜

    洪山煤矿技工学校为什么招生不发榜编辑同志：
    今年四月间，华东煤矿管理局所属洪山煤矿技工学校在淮南市招考学员，报考的共有五百多人，其中有些人是从上海、江苏、山东等地远道赶来的。
    奇怪得很，这次考试到现在已经三个月了，还没有“发榜”的消息。我们曾经给洪山煤矿技工学校去信询问，学校答复说：“我校此次在淮南市招考后，接到淮南市人民委员会的命令，要我校将全部考卷交给政府。此事经与淮南矿务局负责人研究，并取得华东煤矿管理局的同意，我校在淮南地区的考生一律不作录取。至于善后的解释问题应由淮南矿务局负责交代……。”我们又到淮南矿务局人事处询问，他们说“不知道这件事”，拒绝解释和处理。最后，我们写信要求淮南市劳动局为我们交涉这件事情，得到的回答是：“此事与我局无关，应由洪山煤矿技工学校负责处理。”
    编辑同志，这究竟是怎么一回事呢？洪山煤矿技工学校公开招考学员，为什么考过以后就没有下文了呢？我们等待着学校方面给我们一个负责的答复。景荣生等
    编者按：洪山煤矿技工学校招生不发榜的原因，经本报委托淮矿工人报调查是这样的：今年四月初这个学校未经淮南市劳动局正式同意，就私自在市内招生，造成了各地青年和农民大批流入淮南市的情况。淮南市人民委员会发现后曾要求这个学校停止招生，但是负责办理招生的工作人员却置之不理。因此淮南市人民委员会决定将全部考卷扣留，等待学校办妥手续后再来取走。但是，这个学校却采取了“淮南市的考生一律不予录取”的办法，企图一推了事。我们认为，洪山煤矿技工学校这种态度是十分错误的。华东煤矿管理局应该对这个问题进行检查和处理，并且认真负责地做好这次招考的善后工作。
