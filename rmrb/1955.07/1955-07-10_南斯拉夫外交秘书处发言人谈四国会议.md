　　Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, July 9th: The spokesperson of the Yugoslav Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, Draskovic, emphasized the issue of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference at a press conference on the 8th. He said, "The Yugoslav government's assessment of the Geneva Conference is that it is a positive and beneficial action, and a further factor in promoting the easing of world tensions."

　　He said, "The Geneva Conference has undoubtedly confirmed that a realistic opinion has finally prevailed, which is that the methods of the Cold War cannot lead to the resolution of international problems. These problems can only be resolved through negotiation and agreement or understanding, in an atmosphere of easing tensions and strengthening mutual trust and confidence between nations."

　　He also expressed the hope that the four powers "will make every effort to further ease the international situation, further improve the international atmosphere, and achieve a mutually agreed-upon solution to international problems."

　　南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人谈四国会议
    新华社九日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德八日讯：南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人德拉斯科维奇八日在记者招待会上着重谈到日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议的问题。他说：“南斯拉夫政府对日内瓦会议的评价是，它是一个积极的和有益的行动，是一个促进世界紧张局势的缓和的进一步的因素。”
    他说：“日内瓦会议无疑地证实了：一项现实的意见最后已经占上风，这就是：冷战的方法并不能导致国际问题的解决，这些问题只能用谈判和协议或谅解的办法，在紧张局势缓和和国际间彼此的信任和信心加强的气氛中加以解决。”
    他并且表示希望，四大国“将会尽力来进一步缓和国际局势，进一步改善国际气氛并使国际问题得到一致同意的解决。”
