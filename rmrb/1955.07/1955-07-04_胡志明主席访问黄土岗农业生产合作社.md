　　When Chairman Ho Chi Minh arrived, many cooperative members gathered in the square to welcome him. Two Young Pioneers wearing red scarves presented two bouquets of flowers to Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

　　The director of the cooperative, Yin Weichen, introduced the history of the cooperative's development to Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Chairman Ho Chi Minh asked many questions about the cooperative with concern, especially inquiring about the annual income of the farmers after joining the cooperative. Yin Weichen said that the income of farmers has been increasing year by year, and their lives are getting better year by year. Yin Weichen used himself as an example, saying that his income in 1952 was more than 1,300 yuan, more than 1,800 yuan in 1953, and in 1954, although the cooperative suffered a flood, his income still increased to more than 2,100 yuan.

　　While visiting a supply and marketing cooperative, Yin Weichen pointed to a lot of rice and flour and told Chairman Ho Chi Minh that in the past, this rice and flour could only be eaten during festivals, but now the cooperative members can eat it every day.

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh visited the green peppers and jasmine planted by the cooperative members, and visited the homes of two cooperative members to understand their living conditions.

　　Before leaving, the cooperative members gave Chairman Ho Chi Minh tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, potatoes, and other products they produced.

　　胡志明主席访问黄土岗农业生产合作社
    新华社三日讯　三日上午，越南民主共和国胡志明主席由外交部副部长姬鹏飞、我国驻越南大使罗贵波陪同，访问了北京郊区黄土岗乡黄土岗农业生产合作社。
    胡志明主席到达时，许多社员聚集在广场上欢迎。两个系着红领巾的少年儿童把两束鲜花献给胡志明主席。
    合作社主任殷维臣向胡志明主席介绍了这个合作社发展的历史。胡志明主席关切地问到了许多关于合作社的问题，特别询问了农民入社后每年收入的情况。殷维臣说，农民入社后，收入年年增加，生活一年比一年好。殷维臣以他自己作例子，他在一九五二年收入一千三百多元，一九五三年一千八百多元，到一九五四年虽然合作社受到了水灾，但收入仍增加到二千一百多元。
    在参观一所供销合作社时，殷维臣指着许多大米和面粉告诉胡志明主席，过去这些米和面只有在过节的时候才能吃到，现在社员们天天都可以吃到了。
    胡志明主席参观了社员们种的青椒和茉莉花，访问了两个社员的家庭，了解了他们的生活情形。
    临别前，社员们把自己生产的西红柿、青椒、茄子、土豆等送给胡志明主席。
