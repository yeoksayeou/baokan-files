More than 100,000 People in Hubei Along the Yangtze River Go on Dikes to Fight Floods

　　Due to continuous rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, more than 100,000 people in various areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province have gone onto the dikes to fight floods. Wuhan City began inspecting critical dike sections from July 1st, all culverts along the river have been closed, and waterlogging in the city is being vigorously drained. Huangshi City has urgently organized a rescue team of more than 5,000 people, and workers are building secondary dikes around the Daye Steel Plant. The Jingjiang Dike, which defends the Jianghan Plain, experienced a flood peak on the 27th. Thanks to the round-the-clock patrol of more than 12,000 flood prevention troops, five dangerous situations were rescued. By the 28th, the Jingjiang Dike had safely passed its first flood peak of the year. In Xiaogan and Huanggang Prefectures, due to mountain torrents, some embankment sections of tributaries were flooded and breached. After vigorous rescue efforts, most of them are now out of danger and are being repaired. (Yuan Jun)

　  湖北沿江十多万人上堤防汛
    长江中游地区连续降雨，湖北省沿江各地已经有十多万人上堤防汛。武汉市从七月一日起开始巡查险要堤段，沿江各涵闸已经封闭，市内渍水正在大力排除。黄石市紧急组织起来的抢险队有五千多人，大冶钢厂四周，民工们正在加筑子堤。捍卫江汉平原的荆江大堤，二十七日出现洪水高峰，由于防汛大军一万二千多人日夜巡护堤防，抢救了五处险情，到二十八日，荆江大堤已经安全度过了今年的第一次洪峰。孝感和黄冈专区，因为山洪暴发，支流的部分堤垸漫水溃决，经过大力抢护，现在大部分已经脱险，正在堵复中。　（袁军）
