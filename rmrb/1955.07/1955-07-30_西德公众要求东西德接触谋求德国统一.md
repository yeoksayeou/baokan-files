Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 27th: Following the Geneva Four-Power Summit, voices within West German political circles demanding that the Adenauer government reconsider its relationship with NATO and take proactive steps to seek the reunification of Germany have been growing louder.

According to a report by the German Press Agency on the 26th, forty prominent figures in West German society, holding diverse political and religious views, jointly wrote a letter to Adenauer, urging him to cooperate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic in seeking ways to reunify Germany. Among these forty individuals are Colonel Bohning, former head of the planning department of the "Blank Office," and Stenger, a member of the West German Federal Parliament. Colonel Bohning was originally one of the actual organizers of West German rearmament. He was dismissed in April of this year for disagreeing with NATO's atomic "offensive" strategy. Stenger, until recently, was a supporter of NATO policy. When asked why he had recently changed his attitude, he said that after carefully reading the speech delivered by Chairman Bulganin of the Soviet Council of Ministers in Geneva and the comments in European newspapers regarding Germany's future, he realized that if West German figures truly wanted to reunify Germany, they had to take a different path.

Bohning and Stenger submitted a motion to the Geneva conference regarding a solution to the German problem, the day before the Four-Power Summit concluded. The motion advocated revising West Germany's relationship with NATO, limiting West German armed forces to 150,000 instead of the 500,000 stipulated in the Paris Agreements, the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, and the drafting of a law for a Germany that does not participate in any military alliances.

On the day the Geneva conference ended, the West German Social Democratic Party's "New Rhine Newspaper" urged West Germany to increase contact with the German Democratic Republic. On the 25th, the Social Democratic Party once again issued a statement demanding that the federal government "take all possible measures to normalize relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in order to achieve an early resolution of the German question."

Many West German newspapers have been discussing the impact of the Geneva conference decisions on the West German government. The "South German Daily" wrote: Many issues must be reconsidered, and the role and purpose of rearming West Germany is an important issue that must be considered.

    西德公众要求东西德接触谋求德国统一
    新华社柏林二十七日电　在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后，西德政界要求阿登纳政府重新考虑它同北大西洋公约组织的关系，并且采取主动步骤以谋求恢复德国统一的呼声已日趋高涨。
    据德意志通讯社二十六日报道：四十名有着不同政治和宗教观点的西德社会著名人士联名写信给阿登纳，呼吁他同德意志民主共和国代表合作，寻求重新统一德国的办法。在这四十个人中间，有前
  “布兰克部”计划处处长波宁上校和西德联邦议院议员斯丹格纳。波宁上校原来是西德重新武装事宜的实际主持人之一，因为不同意北大西洋集团的原子“攻势”战略而在今年四月被撤职。斯丹格纳则在不久前还是北大西洋政策的支持者。他在回答为什么最近改变态度的问题时说，当他仔细地阅读苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在日内瓦发表的演说以及欧洲国家报纸关于德国前途的评论以后，他认识到：西德人士如果真想重新统一德国，就必须另走一条道路。
    波宁和斯丹格纳曾经在四国政府首脑会议结束的前一天，向这个会议提出一项解决德国问题的动议。这项动议主张修改西德同北大西洋集团的关系，限制西德武装部队为十五万人而不是巴黎协定规定的五十万人，外国军队逐渐从德国撤退以及拟定一个不参加任何军事联盟的德国的法规。
    在日内瓦会议结束的那一天，西德社会民主党的“新莱因报”敦促西德多同德意志民主共和国接触。二十五日，社会民主党再度发表声明，要求联邦政府“采取一切可能的措施使德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国的关系正常化，以达成德国问题的早日解决”。
    许多西德报纸纷纷议论日内瓦会议的决定对西德政府的影响。“南德意志报”写道：必须把许多问题重新考虑一下，重新武装西德的作用和目的问题就是一个必须考虑的重要问题。
