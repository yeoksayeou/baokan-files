Everything for socialist industrialization
The people of the whole country are striving to realize the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country. This great plan is an important step in realizing the socialist industrialization of our country. Only socialist industrialization can comprehensively develop our country's national economy, guarantee the country's economic independence, consolidate national defense, and ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of our people.

For more than two years, the people of the whole country have made great achievements in realizing this glorious historical task. But we must not be arrogant and complacent because of past achievements. Farmers should produce more grain and cash crops to support national industrial construction, cultural and educational departments should train more and better construction talents for the country, and people in other positions should continue to work hard to jointly realize the entire first Five-Year Plan of our country.

The current task of farmers across the country is to actively participate in the agricultural production increase movement centered on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, produce a large amount of grain and cash crops, and support national industrial construction.

    全国人民正在为实现我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。这个伟大的计划是实现我国社会主义工业化的一个重要步骤。只有社会主义工业化，才能全面地发展我国的国民经济，才能保证国家的经济独立，才能巩固国防，才能保证我国人民的物质生活和文化生活水平的不断提高。
    两年多来，全国人民为实现这一光辉的历史任务已作出了巨大的成绩。但我们决不能因过去的成绩而骄傲自满。农民们应生产更多的粮食和经济作物，支援国家工业建设，文化教育部门应为国家培养更多更好的建设人材，其它岗位上的人们也应继续努力，共同为全部实现我国第一个五年计划而奋斗。
