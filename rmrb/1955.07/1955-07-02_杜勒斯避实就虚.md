　　Dulles Evades the Real Issues
　　Jiang Yuanchun
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said on June 28th that the United States "does not, in principle, rule out" direct negotiations with China. However, his further explanation regarding the content of the negotiations makes one doubt whether he is truly willing to negotiate, or is merely engaging in empty talk.
    Dulles stated that the United States is not prepared to discuss "substantive issues" related to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique without the participation of this clique. Here, Dulles' so-called "substantive issues" can only refer to the issue of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan. This statement by Dulles is completely superfluous, as it is entirely a matter of China's internal affairs, and does not require the United States to worry or interfere. The Chinese government has already stated its position on this in previous relevant statements and speeches, which Dulles knows very well.
    Dulles also said that there are "certain issues" that the United States is prepared to discuss. He did not specify what these so-called "certain issues" are. Judging from some of the things he has said in the past, he is referring to the issue of a so-called "ceasefire" between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. However, this issue simply does not exist, because China is not at war with the United States, nor does it want to be at war with the United States. Dulles' insistence on coming forward to negotiate a "ceasefire" between the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and China places himself in a position of interfering in China's internal affairs.
    It is very clear that the issues that Dulles announced he was not prepared to discuss and those he said he wanted to discuss are all unrelated to the issues that should be discussed in direct Sino-American negotiations. What Sino-American direct negotiations should resolve is the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area. This is the real substantive issue. However, Dulles completely avoids talking about this issue. On the contrary, he pushes the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to the forefront, insisting that without the participation of this clique, the United States is not prepared to negotiate.
    People remember that after China expressed its willingness to negotiate with the United States to ease tensions in the Taiwan area, Eisenhower stated at a press conference on April 28th that the United States was willing to negotiate with China on issues "that we see offer opportunities to further reduce tensions and promote world peace." It is precisely such issues that China advocates negotiating with the United States. Dulles' current remarks show that the United States has retreated from its position two months ago. He is again bringing up the issue of China's internal affairs to entangle the negotiations.
    Dulles' attitude of evading the real issues in the matter of Sino-American negotiations fully demonstrates that they have no interest in easing international tensions, do not want to conduct direct negotiations with China, but are merely attempting to use the guise of empty talk about negotiations to conceal the fact that the United States is stepping up war preparations and aggravating tensions in the Taiwan area. This attitude of the United States should arouse the serious vigilance of all those who are concerned about the situation in the Far East and Taiwan.

　　杜勒斯避实就虚
　　蒋元椿
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在六月二十八日说，美国“在原则上并不排斥”和中国进行直接谈判。然而他的关于谈判内容的进一步说明，却使人怀疑他是真的愿意谈判呢，还是只是空谈谈判。
    杜勒斯表示，美国不准备在没有蒋介石卖国集团参加之下讨论同这个集团有关的“实质问题”。在这里，杜勒斯的所谓“实质问题”，只能是指的中国人民解放台湾的问题。杜勒斯这个声明是完全多余的，因为这完全是中国的内政问题，用不着美国来操心干涉。中国政府在历次有关的声明和发言中早已对此表明了态度，杜勒斯知道得很清楚。
    杜勒斯又说，有“某些问题”美国是准备讨论的。他没有说明所谓“某些问题”是什么问题。从他过去说过的一些话看来，他指的是中国人民和蒋介石集团之间的所谓“停火”的问题。然而这个问题根本就不存在，因为中国并没有同美国打仗，也不要同美国打仗。杜勒斯一定要出来替蒋介石卖国集团和中国谈判“停火”，就使自己处在干涉中国内政的地位。
    事情很清楚，杜勒斯所宣布的不准备讨论的和他说要讨论的问题，都是和中美直接谈判所应该讨论的问题无关的事情。中美直接谈判所要解决的是缓和远东、特别是台湾地区的紧张局势的问题。这是真正的实质问题。但是对于这个问题，杜勒斯却完全避而不谈。相反，他还把蒋介石卖国集团顶在前面，硬说没有这个集团参加，美国就不准备谈判。
    人们记得，在中国表示愿意同美国谈判和缓台湾地区紧张局势的问题以后，艾森豪威尔曾经在四月二十八日的记者招待会上表示，美国愿意同中国谈判“我们看来有机会进一步缓和紧张局势、促进世界和平”的问题。中国主张同美国谈判的正是这样的问题。杜勒斯现在的谈话表明，美国从它两个月以前的立场上缩回去了。他重新拿出中国内政问题来纠缠，想挡住谈判。
    杜勒斯在中美谈判问题上这种避实就虚的态度，充分说明他们对于缓和国际紧张局势没有兴趣，不想同中国进行直接谈判，而只是企图用空谈谈判的姿态，来掩饰美国在台湾地区加紧战争准备、加剧紧张局势的事实。美国的这种态度应该引起一切关心远东和台湾局势的人的严重警惕。
