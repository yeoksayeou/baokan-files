Reactions to Newspaper Criticism

　　On June 2nd, this newspaper's commentator, in the article "Earnestly Mobilize the Masses in Carrying Out Streamlining Work," criticized the slow progress of the streamlining work of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China. Recently, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China sent a letter stating that the newspaper's criticism was correct. The letter mentioned that the preparation for the head office's streamlining work had originally begun in March, but due to other meetings being held, the Streamlining Committee meeting was not officially convened until May 21st. Initially, the leadership one-sidedly believed that mobilizing the masses to discuss streamlining work too early would cause ideological fluctuations among the masses. Therefore, the research was only conducted at the leadership level and within the Party, and a preliminary plan was proposed. In fact, the masses had already known at that time that the central-level organs were carrying out streamlining, and they were ideologically prepared. Under such circumstances, if the central government's policies and guidelines had been clarified to the masses earlier, combined with the specific situation of the agency, and the masses had been mobilized to discuss them together, this work could have been carried out a step earlier. The letter from the bank stated: After the newspaper's criticism, Deputy Governor Chen of the Head Office made a mobilization report to all employees on June 14th and mobilized everyone to participate in the discussion. At present, various units have put forward streamlining plans, and the Streamlining Committee is conducting research and preparing to submit them to the Executive Meeting and the Party Group for review and approval.

　　对本报批评的反应
    六月二日，本报评论员在“进行整编工作必须认真发动群众”一文中，曾对中国人民银行总行整编工作进行迟缓的情况提出了批评。最近，中国人民银行总行来信认为报纸的这一批评是正确的。来信中提到，总行的整编工作原来在三月份已开始准备，但由于召开了别的会议，所以直到五月二十一日才正式召开整编委员会会议。起初，领导思想上片面地认为过早地发动群众讨论整编工作，会引起群众思想波动，因此，只是在领导上和党内进行了研究并提出了初步方案。其实当时群众早已知道中央级机关在进行整编，思想上已有了准备。在这种情况下，如果早根据中央的政策方针，结合本机关的具体情况，向群众讲清政策，发动群众一齐来讨论，是可以早一步进行这一工作的。该行来信说：报纸批评以后，总行陈副行长已在六月十四日向全体员工作了动员报告，并发动大家进行讨论。目前各单位已提出了整编方案，整编委员会正在进行研究，准备送交行务会议和党组审查确定。
