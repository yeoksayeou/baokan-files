The visit to China by the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by President Ho Chi Minh has concluded. During their visit, the government delegations of China and Vietnam held talks and issued a joint communiqué. The talks proceeded in a sincere and harmonious atmosphere from beginning to end. Both sides expressed complete agreement on issues of common concern and important issues in the international situation. The two countries will continue to make joint efforts to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, especially for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. Obviously, the results of the two countries' talks are of great significance for strengthening the just struggle of the two peoples for their national independence and strengthening the common cause of the people of all countries in maintaining peace. This historic meeting marks a further development of Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations.

This is a major event in the lives of the people of China and Vietnam. The Chinese people express a warm welcome to the outcome of the talks.

Since the Geneva Conference, a sharp, complex, and repeated struggle has continued between the forces of peace and the forces of war. Contrary to the wishes of the American aggressive bloc, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people. This not only extinguished the flames of war that seriously threatened world peace, but also provided an excellent example for the international settlement of disputes through consultation, which has had a profound impact on the international situation. Therefore, the people of all countries regard the Geneva Accords as a brilliant victory for international peace forces and fully support the struggle of the Indochinese people to implement the Geneva Accords and consolidate peace in Indochina. However, the American aggressive bloc is unwilling to learn from reality. In order to undermine the achievements of the Geneva Conference, it pieced together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, forcibly placed South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos under the "protection" of this bloc, and is stepping up efforts to further pull these countries into the military bloc. In order to undermine peace in Indochina, the United States is intensifying its military, political, and other forms of interference activities, stepping up the equipping and training of local troops in South Vietnam, and signing a military aid agreement with Cambodia, and is also attempting to sign a similar agreement with Laos. These activities in violation of the Geneva Accords have exacerbated the tense situation in the Far East and internationally.

Thanks to the efforts of the Vietnamese people and the support of the people of all countries for these efforts, the assembly and transfer of military forces stipulated in the Geneva Accords have been completed. The International Commission has made an important contribution in this regard. The key issue now is to achieve the democracy, independence, and unification of the Vietnamese people through free general elections. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the responsible authorities in both regions of Vietnam should begin consultations on the issue of general elections from July 20 this year, so that free general elections can be held next July under the supervision of the International Commission composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada to achieve the unification of the whole of Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to continue to faithfully implement the Geneva Accords and announced on June 6 that it was prepared to consult with the responsible authorities in South Vietnam on matters related to general elections. However, the American aggressive bloc is doing everything possible to step up the obstruction of the general elections in Vietnam, attempting to split Vietnam. Not only that, but the "New York Times" on June 29 openly stated: "The United States does not like the Geneva Accords." It said that the United States is "implementing aid and training programs" to make South Vietnam "strong and stable enough so that it can provide a reasonable alternative to the Communist rule of North Vietnam." This shows that the American aggressive bloc attempts to completely disregard the Geneva Accords and impose the reactionary regime fostered by the United States on the entire Vietnamese people. The Ngo Dinh Diem government dares to use violence to suppress the patriotic movement of the South Vietnamese people demanding general elections because of the support of the United States. This is a serious threat to the Geneva Accords.

Peace-loving countries and people resolutely oppose the United States' actions to undermine the Geneva Accords and firmly support the efforts of the Vietnamese people to achieve national unity through consultations between the North and South and the holding of free general elections. The recent joint declarations of the Soviet Union and India, and Poland and India, have called on the countries of the Geneva Conference to fulfill their obligations and ensure the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. It is also noted that the governments of Britain and France have also expressed their willingness to fulfill their obligations under the Geneva Accords. What is important now is that the countries concerned must take practical actions to promote consultations between the North and South of Vietnam and ensure that the general elections are held as scheduled. We are deeply convinced that as long as the countries concerned persevere and strive hard, the Geneva Accords can be implemented.

The people of China and Vietnam have a long tradition of friendship, always caring for and helping each other. In recent years, the two countries have been developing economic and cultural relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The agreement reached between the two countries on transportation and water conservancy issues last December has strengthened the economic cooperation between the two countries. Trade between the two countries has also increased, and the trade volume stipulated in the trade contracts between the two countries this year has increased three times compared with last year. In order to assist the Vietnamese people in healing the wounds of long-term war and restoring and developing the national economy, our country will provide a gratuitous grant of 800 million yuan in RMB to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries will also be gradually expanded. There is no doubt that the development of Sino-Vietnamese friendship will make a significant contribution to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

### 中越友好关系的进一步发展

　　中越友好关系的进一步发展
    胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团已结束了在中国的友好访问。在他们的访问期间，中越两国政府代表团举行了会谈，发表了联合公报。会谈自始至终在诚恳融洽的气氛中进行，双方对共同关心的各项问题和国际局势中的重要问题表现了完全一致的意见，两国将继续为维护亚洲和世界和平，特别是为了日内瓦协议的彻底实施，而作共同的努力。显然，两国的会谈结果，对于两国人民加强为自己的民族独立事业的正义斗争，加强世界各国人民维护和平的共同事业，都有着重大的意义。这次历史性的会谈标志着中越友好关系进一步的发展。
    这是中越两国人民生活中的一个重大事件。中国人民对会谈的结果表示热烈的欢迎。
    自日内瓦会议以来，和平力量和战争势力之间继续展开着尖锐、复杂和反复的斗争。日内瓦会议违反美国侵略集团的愿望，达成了在尊重印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那和平的协议。这不仅熄灭了严重威胁世界和平的战火，而且为国际协商解决争端作出了极好的范例，对国际局势发生着深远的影响。因此，各国人民把日内瓦协议看作国际和平力量的一个辉煌胜利，并全力支持印度支那人民贯彻实施日内瓦协议、巩固印度支那和平的斗争。但是，美国侵略集团是不肯从现实中吸取教训的。为了破坏日内瓦会议的成果，它拼凑了东南亚侵略集团，硬把越南南部、柬埔寨和老挝放在这个集团的“保护”之下，并正在加紧设法把这些国家进一步拉入军事集团。为了破坏印度支那的和平，美国变本加厉地进行军事、政治和各方面的干涉活动，在南越加紧装备和训练当地军队，并同柬埔寨签订了军事援助协定，还企图同老挝签订同样的协定。这种违反日内瓦协议的活动，加剧了远东和国际紧张局势。
    由于越南人民的努力和各国人民对这种努力的支持，日内瓦协议所规定的军事部队的集结和转移工作已经完成。国际委员会在这方面作出了重要的贡献。今后的关键问题，是通过自由普选，实现越南人民的民主、独立和统一。根据日内瓦协议的规定，越南双方地区负责当局应从今年七月二十日开始就普选问题进行协商，以便明年七月在印度、波兰、加拿大三国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行自由普选，实现越南全国的统一。越南民主共和国政府决心继续忠实地履行日内瓦协议，并已在六月六日宣布准备同越南南部负责当局协商有关普选的事宜。但是，美国侵略集团却千方百计地加紧阻挠越南的普选，企图分裂越南。不仅如此，六月二十九日的“纽约时报”还公开说：“美国不欢喜日内瓦协定”。它说美国正在“实行援助和训练计划”，要使南越“足够强大和稳定，以便它能够为北越的共产党统治提供一个合理的代替办法”。这说明美国侵略集团企图根本不顾日内瓦协议，把美国扶植的反动政权强加在全越南人民身上。吴庭艳政府胆敢用暴力镇压南越人民要求举行普选的爱国运动，就是由于有美国的支持。这是对日内瓦协议的严重威胁。
    爱好和平的国家和人民坚决反对美国破坏日内瓦协议的行为，坚决支持越南人民通过南北双方协商和举行自由普选以实现国家统一的努力。最近的苏印、波印联合声明，都呼吁日内瓦会议各国应履行它们的义务，保证日内瓦协议的全部实施。人们还注意到，英、法两国政府也表示愿意履行日内瓦协议的义务。现在重要的是，有关各国都要拿出实际行动来，促成越南南北双方的协商，保证普选的如期举行。我们深信，只要有关各国坚持不懈，努力奋斗，日内瓦协议是可以贯彻下去的。
    中越人民有着悠久的传统友谊，一直互相关怀，互相帮助。这几年来，两国在平等互利的基础上开展着经济和文化关系。去年十二月两国关于交通和水利问题会谈所达成的协议，加强了两国的经济合作。两国的贸易往来也有了增加，今年两国贸易合同规定的贸易额比去年增加了三倍。为了协助越南人民医治长期的战争创伤，恢复和发展国民经济，我国将以人民币八亿元无偿赠送给越南民主共和国政府，两国的贸易和文化交流也将逐步扩大起来。毫无疑问，中越友谊的发展，一定会对维护亚洲和世界和平作出重大的贡献。
