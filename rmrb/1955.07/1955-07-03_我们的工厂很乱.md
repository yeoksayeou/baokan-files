To the Editor:

"Our factory is very chaotic!"—This phrase has become a common saying among the employees of the Transportation Factory under the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation. After working in this factory for some time, I deeply feel that this statement is very accurate.

Take the "chaos" during the final inspection (pre-delivery inspection) of truck No. 68 in early April as an example: someone was lying under the truck adjusting the brakes, while the people repairing the body above were hammering, covering the person under the truck with dirt and sand; someone was washing the carburetor with gasoline in the front, while someone was welding on the roof, with sparks flying everywhere, almost setting the gasoline on fire; someone was painting, while someone else was installing parts, and the freshly painted areas were rubbed by the installers' clothes, turning it into a "painting." Such situations, where several mutually hindering processes are concentrated on one object simultaneously, are not accidental phenomena in this factory.

Once, section chief Xing Wanquan wanted to start a truck to test the brakes. Suddenly, more than twenty people from the paint group came and said they wanted to push the truck to be painted. Xing Wanquan sat in the driver's seat and stepped on the brakes hard to prevent them from pushing it away; the people from the paint group forcibly pulled Xing Wanquan out of the truck and pushed it away. Xing Wanquan was not convinced and ran to the paint group to drive the truck back…

Such chaotic "processes" inevitably affect work efficiency and the quality of repair. This factory has six hundred employees, but can only overhaul fifty vehicles per month; and by mid-April, the number of vehicles returned for rework had reached "No. 38."

I am amazed by the chaotic situation in this factory. But what amazes me even more is why the leading staff of this factory turn a blind eye to such a serious chaotic phenomenon and do not carry out necessary rectification?

### “我们的工厂很乱”

　　“我们的工厂很乱”编辑同志：
    “我们的工厂很乱！”——这句话已经成为山西省交通厅所属交通工厂职工的口头禅。我到这个工厂工作了一个时期，深深感到这句话很确切。
    拿四月上旬交检（交车前的检修）六十八号卡车时的“乱劲”来看吧：有人躺在车底调整刹车，上面修车身的人却在敲鎯头，使躺在车底的人弄得满脸泥砂；前面有人拿了汽油在洗汽化器，车顶上却有人在烧电焊，火花四散，差点把汽油烧着；有人在油漆，有人却在装配件，刚漆好的地方就被装配件人的衣服擦成像一幅“油画”。像这样把好几道互相妨碍的工序集中在一个工作物上同时进行的情况，在这个工厂里并不是偶然的现象。
    有一次，工段长邢万泉要将一辆卡车开动试刹车。突然，油漆组来了二十多个人，说是要把这辆车子推去喷漆。邢万泉坐在驾驶室使劲踩住刹车，不让推走；油漆组人就硬把邢万泉从车子上拉了下来，把车子推走了。邢万泉不服气，又跑到油漆组把车子开了回来……。
      “工序”这样乱，不能不影响工作效率和修车质量。这个厂子有六百名职工，每月只能大修车五十部；而到四月中旬为止，返工车的编号就到了“三十八号”。
    我为这个工厂的混乱情况感到惊异。但更使我感到惊异的是，为什么这个厂的领导工作人员见到这种严重的混乱现象却熟视无睹，而不进行必要的整顿呢？　　谢锡源
