Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 20th - The Burmese Committee for the Defence of World Peace issued a statement on the 15th, exposing the United States' plot to undermine the Geneva Accords and attempt to turn Indochina into its military base.

The statement pointed out that after the Geneva Conference, the US government, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, supplied the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam with large quantities of weapons, and supported the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in arresting peaceful and democratic people, in order to undermine Vietnam's unification and general elections. The statement said that in order to expand its base of aggression, the United States also signed a military aid agreement with Cambodia, and is attempting to turn Laos into its military base as well. The statement pointed out that these facts prove that the United States is plotting to drag all the Indochinese countries into the Manila Treaty Organization to serve its aggressive policies.

The statement said that in order to defend peace in Asia, the countries concerned should work to promote the realization of general elections in Vietnam, oppose the US military agreement with Cambodia, and demand the complete implementation of the resolutions of the Geneva Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th - The latest issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly published a dispatch from its Tokyo correspondent stating that US Ambassador to the Ngo Dinh Diem government, Reinhardt, has been intensifying his activities to try to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct elections.

The dispatch said that the US Ambassador, acting on instructions from the US State Department, is implementing a new plan, which has three main points:

	(1) In order to strengthen the Ngo Dinh Diem government in South Vietnam, combat troops that are loyal to the government and well-equipped should be established, and they should be supplemented by a strong police force. The United States will send a large number of military advisors to Saigon, who will help organize the army.

	(2) The country should be declared a "Republic," and the administrative structure must be reorganized according to the American model, as South Korea has done.

	(3) Efforts to hold elections in Vietnam should be obstructed.

The dispatch said that this is a carefully considered plan of the US government that has been revealed to top-level figures in Tokyo.

    缅甸和平委员会斥责美国破坏日内瓦协议
    印度报纸揭露美国破坏日内瓦协定和阻挠选举的阴谋
    新华社二十日讯　仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在十五日发表声明，揭露美国破坏日内瓦协议，企图把印度支那变为它的军事基地的阴谋。
    声明指出，在日内瓦会议以后，美国政府即不顾世界人民的反对，以大批武器供给南越吴庭艳集团，支持吴庭艳集团逮捕和平民主人士，以破坏越南的统一和普选。声明说，美国为了扩大侵略基地，又同柬埔寨签订了军事援助协定，并企图也把老挝变为它的军事基地。声明指出，这些事实证明，美国正阴谋把印度支那各国都拉进为它的侵略政策服务的马尼拉条约组织。
    声明说，为了保卫亚洲和平，有关国家应努力促成越南普选的实现，反对美国同柬埔寨的军事协定，要求彻底实现日内瓦会议的决议。
    新华社新德里十八日电　最近一期“德里时代”周刊刊载它的驻东京记者发来的电讯说，美国驻吴庭艳政府大使莱因哈特一直在加紧活动，来设法破坏日内瓦协定和阻挠选举。
    电讯说，根据美国国务院指示行事的美国大使正在实行新的计划，这个计划分三个要点：
    （一）为了加强南越的吴庭艳政府，应该建立忠于政府的、装备良好的战斗部队，并且应该辅以强大的警察部队。美国将派遣大批军事顾问到西贡去，他们将帮助组织军队。
    （二）应该宣布国家为“共和国”，必须按照美国的方针改组行政机构，像南朝鲜所做的那样。
    （三）应该阻挠在越南举行选举的努力。
    电讯说，这是向东京最高级人士透露的美国政府周详考虑过的计划。
