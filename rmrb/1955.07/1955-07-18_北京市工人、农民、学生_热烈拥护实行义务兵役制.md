    Beijing Workers, Farmers, and Students
    Warmly Support the Implementation of Compulsory Military Service
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Following the publication of Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's "Report on the Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China" at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, employees and students of many factories and schools in Beijing, as well as farmers in the suburbs, held discussion meetings or collective newspaper readings on the 17th. Everyone warmly supported this report.
    After reading the report, young workers Kong Xiangyun, Liu Hua, and five others from the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant didn't even eat breakfast before collectively writing a letter to the Ministry of National Defense, expressing their firm support for the implementation of compulsory military service. The letter stated: "In addition to our determination to overfulfill the 1955 production tasks on the basis of safe production, we must also strive to study politics and culture, exercise, and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and dedicate our strength to defend our great motherland. We must also vigorously promote the advantages of compulsory military service so that everyone around us understands its benefits and prevents sabotage by bad elements." Han Ying, a young worker at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, said, "In addition to doing my current job well, I must also exercise regularly and strive to learn political and scientific knowledge so that I can go to the front line of defending the motherland when necessary." Yan Fukun, a young ticket seller from the Beijing Tram Company's Maintenance Yard No. 3 and a Beijing model worker, said after reading the report: "I must not only work hard in production but also actively exercise, preparing to serve in the military at any time and undertake the sacred duty of defending the motherland."
    The Youth Shock Brigade of the Yongqing Vegetable Production Cooperative in Landianchang Township, Haidian District, Beijing, collectively read the newspaper containing the report on the draft military service law on the 17th. Li Fengyun, a member of the Communist Youth League, said, "When compulsory military service is implemented in Beijing, I will definitely sign up first. I talked to my mother about it a long time ago, and she agrees too." Zhang Liantong, a member of the Communist Youth League, said, "The implementation of compulsory military service is great. Serving in the military to defend the motherland is our civic duty. In the future, if I join the army, I will be able to learn technology, and my political thinking will also be improved." Zhao Weixin, a military dependent in his sixties from Huoqi Camp Township, said: "After reading the report on the draft military service law, I couldn't help but feel happy from the bottom of my heart. Both of my children, a son and a daughter, have joined the army. They have learned a lot in the army and are working very well. With the implementation of compulsory military service, other young people will also be able to take turns serving in the military and fulfill their responsibility to defend the motherland!"
    Many students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School and other schools, after studying the report on the draft military service law, expressed that they would study hard, exercise well, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Liu Huadong, a student who was recently recommended by the school to study at the Military Engineering Academy and has not yet left school, said excitedly: "In 1951, I signed up to join the People's Liberation Army, but I was not approved because my physical condition was not good enough. Now I can go to the Military Engineering Academy to study, I am really happy." Xia Peidao, a graduating senior from Beijing No. 25 Middle School, said that after he goes to university, he will definitely study hard and exercise well to strive to become a reserve officer.

    北京市工人、农民、学生
    热烈拥护实行义务兵役制
    本报讯  国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”发表后，北京市许多工厂、学校的职工、学生和郊区农民在十七日举行了座谈会或进行集体读报，大家都热烈拥护这一报告。
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部青年工人孔祥云、刘华等七人在读过这一报告以后，连早饭也没有吃，就集体给国防部写了一封信，表示他们坚决拥护实行义务兵役制。信里写道：“我们除决心在安全生产的基础上超额完成一九五五年的生产任务之外，还要努力学习政治和文化，锻炼身体，准备随时响应祖国号召，为保卫我们伟大的祖国献出我们的力量。我们还要大力宣传义务兵役制的优越性，使我们周围每一个人都懂得它的好处，并防止坏分子的破坏。”北京农业机械厂青年工人韩英说：“我除了把现在的工作做好之外，还要经常锻炼身体，努力学习政治和科学知识，以便将来必要时走到保卫祖国的国防前线去。”北京电车公司保养三场青年售票员、北京市劳动模范延福坤读过报告以后说：“我一定要一方面努力生产，一方面积极锻炼身体，准备着随时服兵役，担当起保卫祖国的神圣义务。”
    北京市海淀区蓝靛厂乡永青蔬菜生产合作社青年突击队十七日集体阅读了载有关于兵役法草案报告的报纸。青年团员李凤云说：“北京实行义务兵役制的时候，我一定首先报名。我和母亲早就谈过了，她也赞成。”青年团员张连通说：“实行义务兵役制太好了。服兵役保卫祖国，是我们公民的义务。将来我参加了部队，能学习到技术，政治思想也能提高一步。”火器营乡六十多岁的军属赵维新说：“我读了关于兵役法草案的报告以后，不由得从心里高兴。我两个孩子一男一女都参军了，他们在军队里学会了很多东西，工作得也很好。实行了义务兵役制，其他青年就也能轮流服兵役，尽保卫祖国的责任了！”
    北京市第四中学等不少学生在学习了兵役法草案的报告以后，纷纷表示要努力学习，锻炼好身体，随时响应祖国的召唤。最近被学校保送到军事工程学院去学习尚未离校的学生刘华栋兴奋地说：“一九五一年我报名参加解放军，因为身体不够条件，没有批准。现在我能去军事工程学院学习，真高兴极了。”北京市第二十五中学高三应届毕业生夏培道表示自己升入大学以后，一定努力学习，很好地锻炼身体，争取做一个预备役军官。
