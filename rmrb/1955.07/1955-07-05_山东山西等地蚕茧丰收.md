Shandong, Shanxi and other places have bumper harvests of silkworm cocoons
    Shandong Province's average cocoon yield per silkworm egg card this year is 50 jin, an increase of about 3 jin compared to 1954. According to surveys in key cocoon-producing counties such as Linqu, Yidu, Laiwu, Mengyin, and Tai'an, this year's cocoon production increased by more than 200,000 jin compared to 1954. As of June 24, the province has nearly completed its procurement plan. (Lu Jianmin)
    This year, Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province experimentally raised 1,000 silkworm egg cards of improved Jiangsu breeds, and generally achieved a bumper harvest. Duanshi Township in Qinshui County experimentally raised 143 cards, producing more than 8,800 jin of fresh cocoons, an average of 61 jin and 11 liang per card. Huangyinpo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township raised 5 cards, with an average yield of 68 jin per card, more than twice the yield of local silkworm breeds. The improved silkworm breeds experimented with in other regions generally yielded more than twice the yield of local silkworm breeds. (Chang Yongfeng, Wang Shoujun)
