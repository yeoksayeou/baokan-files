Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th: TASS Geneva, July 24th: The full text of the instructions from the heads of government of the four powers to their foreign ministers is as follows:

The heads of government of France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States, desiring to contribute to the relaxation of international tension and the consolidation of trust between nations, instruct their foreign ministers to continue to consider the following questions on which views have already been exchanged at the Geneva Conference, and to propose effective solutions to these problems, taking into account the close link between the reunification of Germany and the issue of European security, and the fact that the successful resolution of each of these issues will contribute to the consolidation of peace.

	I. European Security and Germany

In order to establish European security, taking into account the legitimate interests of all countries and their inherent right to individual and collective self-defense, the foreign ministers are instructed to consider various proposals to this end, including the following: the conclusion of a European, or a security treaty involving a part of Europe, including provisions whereby member states undertake not to use force and not to assist aggressors; the implementation of limitations, supervision, and inspection of armed forces and armaments; the establishment of a zone between East and West within which the deployment of armed forces must be subject to common agreement; and consideration of other possible proposals for resolving this issue.

The heads of government, recognizing their shared responsibility for resolving the German problem and reunifying Germany, have agreed that the resolution of the German problem and the reunification of Germany through free elections should be carried forward in accordance with the German people's national interests and the interests of European security. The foreign ministers should make such arrangements as they may deem appropriate for participation or consultation by other interested parties.

	II. Disarmament

The four powers' heads of government, desiring to eliminate the threat of war and alleviate the burden of armaments, believe that it is necessary to establish a system for the effective guarantee of the control and reduction of all armaments and armed forces to ensure peace and human happiness.

Recognizing that achievements in this area would allow vast material resources to be diverted to the peaceful economic development of all countries, to promote their welfare, and to assist underdeveloped countries,

Agree:

	(1) To work together for these purposes, through the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, to develop an acceptable disarmament system;
	(2) To instruct their representatives in the Subcommittee to fulfill the tasks entrusted to them by the United Nations, taking into account in their work the views and proposals put forward by the heads of government at this conference;
	(3) To recommend that the next meeting of the Subcommittee be held in New York on August 29, 1955;
	(4) To instruct the foreign ministers to pay attention to the progress of the Disarmament Commission, taking into account the views and proposals put forward by the heads of government at this conference, and to consider whether the four governments can proactively take any further useful action on disarmament.

	III. Developing Contacts Between East and West

The foreign ministers should, through experts, study measures—including those that may be taken in the institutions and specialized organizations of the United Nations—that should be able to (a) facilitate the gradual elimination of obstacles to the free movement of people and peaceful trade between countries; (b) facilitate freer contact and exchange of mutual benefit to the countries and peoples concerned.

	IV. The four foreign ministers should meet in Geneva in October to begin discussing these issues and to decide on the organization of their work.

    四国政府首脑给外长们的指示
    新华社二十四日讯　塔斯社日内瓦二十四日讯：四国政府首脑给外交部长们的指示全文如下：
    法国、联合王国、苏联和美国的政府首脑，本着对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固各国间的信任作出贡献的愿望，指示他们的外交部长们继续考虑已经在日内瓦会议上交换过意见的下列各项问题，并且提出解决这些问题的有效办法，应该考虑到重新统一德国和欧洲安全问题之间的密切联系以及这些问题中的每一个问题的成功解决将有利于巩固和平这一事实。
      一、欧洲安全和德国
    为了在考虑到所有国家的合法利益和它们进行单独的和集体的自卫的固有权利的情况下建立欧洲安全，指示外交部长们考虑以此为目的的各种建议，包括下列建议在内：缔结一项欧洲的、或者是欧洲一部分国家的安全条约，其中包括成员国承担不使用武力和不援助侵略者的义务的规定；对武装部队和军备实行限制、监督和视察；在东西方之间建立一个地区，在这个地区之内的武装部队的部署必须取得共同协议；此外还要考虑关于解决这个问题的其他可能的建议。
    政府首脑们认识到他们对解决德国问题和重新统一德国的共同责任，已经同意德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国的工作应该在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下进行。外交部长们应当作出他们可能认为适当的关于由其他有关方面参加或同其他有关方面磋商的安排。
      二、裁军
    四国政府首脑，希望消除战争的威胁和减轻军备的负担。相信为了保证和平和人类幸福，有必要建立一个制度在有效的保障下控制和裁减所有军备和武装部队，
    认识到这方面的成就会使广大的物质资源得以转而用于各国的和平经济发展，以增进它们的福利，以及援助落后国家，
    同意：
    （一）为了这些目的而共同努力，通过联合国裁军委员会小组委员会拟订一个可以接受的裁军制度；
    （二）指示他们在小组委员会的代表履行联合国委托给他们的任务，在他们的工作中考虑政府首脑们在这次会议上提出的意见和建议；
    （三）建议小组委员会下次会议于一九五五年八月二十九日在纽约举行；（四）指示外交部长们注意裁军委员会的进程，考虑到政府首脑们在这次会议上提出的意见和建议，考虑四国政府是否能在裁军方面主动采取任何进一步的有用的行动。
    三、发展东西方之间的接触
    外交部长们应该通过专家研究措施——包括在联合国的机构和专门组织中可能采取的措施在内，这些措施应当能够（甲）促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间的自由往来和和平贸易的障碍；（乙）促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交流。
      四、四国外交部长应在十月间在日内瓦举行会议来开始讨论这些问题，并且决定他们的工作的组织。
