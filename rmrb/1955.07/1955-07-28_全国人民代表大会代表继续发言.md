Xinhua News Agency, July 27th – The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued today, with deputies of the National People's Congress and responsible persons from various departments of state organs delivering speeches on the main items on the agenda of this session.

    Today, the following twenty-three individuals spoke at the meeting: Bo Yibo, Zhang Nanxian, Shao Lizi, Wu Yaozong, Yu Pingbo, Li Chunqing, Sheng Pihua, Cao Yu, Luo Ruiqing, Ye Jianying, Liu Wenhui, Bangda Duoji, Yi Shijuan, Deng Chumin, Che Xiangchen, Dong Qiwu, Ou Baichuan, Jin Baishan, Han Wangchen, Tong Dizhou, Zhang Hanying, Sha Ting, Wang Yanan.

    Bo Yibo, Director of the Third Office of the State Council and concurrently Director of the State Construction Commission, spoke on the issue of developing heavy industry in the Five-Year Plan. He said that the First Five-Year Plan stipulates the priority development of heavy industry, and the allocation of 88.8 percent of industrial investment to heavy industry construction is entirely in line with the requirements of the Party's general line during the transition period and the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. Since liberation, heavy industry has made great progress, but compared with the needs of the country, the level of heavy industry is still very backward. In his speech, Bo Yibo elaborated on several key issues that must be resolved by the heavy industry sector in the Five-Year Plan, such as the technological transformation of heavy industry and the mastery of new technologies, the development of industrial standardization, the planned arrangement, specialization, and collaboration of heavy industry, the improvement of enterprise management, the implementation of increased production and thrift, the improvement of labor productivity, and the training of technical personnel.

    Bo Yibo said that due to China's poor foundation in heavy industry and lack of experience, solving the above problems will encounter many difficulties. However, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and with the high construction enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, technicians, and cadres, as long as we earnestly learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and do a good job in the political and ideological work of enterprises, and give play to the initiative and creativity of the masses, the heavy industry construction and production tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan will surely be completed.

    Bo Yibo concluded by pointing out that in the arduous work of heavy industry construction, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance, resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and protect the achievements of heavy industry construction.

    Deputy Zhang Nanxian, in his speech, used many examples he saw during his inspection in Wuhan to prove that there is an abundance of grain in the cities, and the monthly grain ration allocated to citizens is generally generous, exceeding the normal monthly food intake per person. He said that the government's standard for fixed-quantity supply should be one that ensures everyone has enough to eat without wasting grain.

    Deputy Shao Lizi said that before liberation, he was saddened by Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, and he was often worried and depressed, which harmed his health. Since liberation, seeing that the mainland of the country has achieved peaceful reunification, and after economic recovery, planned peaceful construction has begun, the Chinese people not only enjoy peace and happiness themselves, but can also shoulder the responsibility of defending world peace. He feels incomparably happy in spirit and naturally vigorous in body. He said: Look at my real example, and people in Taiwan can no longer believe the rumors that people on the mainland are suffering. He said that each of us should raise our political vigilance and ideological awareness, work diligently, unite closely, and strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan.

    Deputy Wu Yaozong said: The First Five-Year Plan is of great significance for defending world peace. There is no fact that can more eloquently demonstrate the peaceful intentions of New China than the First Five-Year Plan. He also said: The First Five-Year Plan is a great plan that begins to change the face of China and create infinite happiness for the people of the whole country and for our children and grandchildren. He expressed that Christians across the country wholeheartedly support this plan and are willing to dedicate their greatest efforts to the implementation of this plan.

    Deputy Yu Pingbo thanked people from all over the country for their help in criticizing his book "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber." He said that after this criticism, he deeply felt that old intellectuals must actively reform themselves in order to contribute to socialist construction. This serious and sharp ideological struggle made him understand the errors of idealism that he had not recognized for decades. Yu Pingbo said that he had gained a lot from this ideological struggle. He had preliminarily studied Marxism-Leninism, recognized the harm of bourgeois literary theory, and corrected the direction of literary research. He also said that the concern and help of the responsible comrades of the Communist Party and the democratic parties and friends in the literary and art circles made him very moved. He specifically understood that the Communist Party's policy of uniting and reforming intellectuals is completely correct.

    Deputy Li Chunqing, in his speech, expressed the feelings of the people of Taiwan about the country's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. He said: When China had almost no industry, Japan seized Taiwan. The compatriots in Taiwan have suffered all kinds of hardships and deeply understand the importance of national industrialization. The Taiwanese, who have lost their motherland for fifty years and are still unable to be protected by their motherland, need a strong China so much. He believes that the Taiwanese compatriots have a profound feeling of supporting the Five-Year Plan, and their desire to realize the Five-Year Plan is urgent.

    He said: For the compatriots in Taiwan, the current facts are cruel: while the people of the motherland are rejoicing, they are living in suffering. Now, they are still fighting heroically and unyieldingly to return to the embrace of their motherland—the People's Republic of China. The compatriots in Taiwan resolutely oppose the United States' occupation of Taiwan. They did not become slaves of Japan in the past, and they will never become slaves of the United States today. The compatriots in Taiwan support all decisions made by the motherland to liberate Taiwan, and they look forward to the day of liberation day and night. Li Chunqing said: The cause of the Five-Year Plan is advancing victoriously, and Taiwan is getting closer to liberation day by day. Taiwan will surely be liberated, and the people of Taiwan will surely return.

    Deputy Sheng Pihua pointed out in his speech that it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for private industrialists and businessmen in socialist transformation. He said that many private industrialists and businessmen have insufficient understanding of the important significance of combining enterprise transformation with personal ideological transformation. In the future, we should promote private industrialists and businessmen to study hard, correct their understanding, obey national plans, practice strict economy, eliminate waste, accumulate funds for national construction, and do a good job in the tasks entrusted by the state. At the same time, he hoped that the staff of state-owned economic departments will pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the ideological transformation of individual capitalists in the process of leading the transformation of enterprises by private industrialists and businessmen.

    Deputy Cao Yu's speech first expressed his gratitude to the Party and the government for timely exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and arresting and interrogating Hu Feng, a counter-revolutionary element with heinous crimes. He said that this heartening move not only shows that our government is the most democratic government, but also the most powerful government. He also talked about two personal experiences he gained from the Hu Feng incident: First, we must be vigilant against all counter-revolutionary elements, and first of all, we must be vigilant against our own individualism and liberalism, because "individualism and liberalism are good friends of counter-revolutionary elements." Second, we must be closer to the Party and the government, and we must be absolutely loyal and honest to the Party and the government. He said that when all the good people completely lean towards the Party, the hidden counter-revolutionary elements will be isolated and lose their hiding place.

    Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council and Minister of Public Security, made a speech at the meeting on the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionary elements.

    Luo Ruiqing first used examples of the recent activities of counter-revolutionary elements to illustrate that counter-revolutionary elements are trying their best to destroy the people's safety and property, undermine socialist construction, and vainly attempt to subvert the People's Republic of China.

    After analyzing the various reasons for the rampant activities of counter-revolutionaries, Luo Ruiqing said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951 achieved great results, but we should see that the main focus of that movement was on open counter-revolutionaries, and not many hidden counter-revolutionaries were discovered and suppressed, and the enemy's main mode of activity today is hidden.

    Luo Ruiqing said that in order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, we must first raise our vigilance. We must constantly educate Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, members of various democratic parties and people's organizations, all staff members of state organs, and the people of the whole country with the task of raising revolutionary vigilance. Only in this way can we tighten various systems, block various loopholes that can be exploited by counter-revolutionary elements, and discover and eliminate counter-revolutionary elements in a timely manner.

    Luo Ruiqing said that in order to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, we must mobilize the masses and combine the specialized work of maintaining public security with the struggle of the masses. We must adhere to and implement correct policies. We must strictly draw the line between counter-revolutionary elements. Chairman Mao's instructions on "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents; preventing deviations, and not wronging a good person" must become the guiding principle for all public security organs and the people of the whole country in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, he pointed out: The state's policy on dealing with counter-revolutionary elements is still a combination of suppression and leniency. We ask all criminals to frankly explain their crimes to the government and help the government find out the facts of other criminals. In this regard, our principle is: those who resist will be severely punished, those who confess will be treated leniently, and those who perform meritorious service can offset their crimes. Luo Ruiqing's speech repeatedly aroused warm applause from all the deputies.

    Deputy Ye Jianying expressed his opinions on the issue of consolidating national defense in his speech. He said: Our socialist construction needs a long-term international peaceful environment. In order to safeguard the security of the motherland and the people, safeguard the socialist construction of the motherland, and liberate our territory of Taiwan, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must have sufficient preparedness and vigilance. We must take all possible measures to continue to strengthen the Chinese People's Liberation Army and arm the Chinese People's Liberation Army with a sufficient number of the latest modern equipment. To this end, we must accelerate the development of our industry, especially heavy industry. He pointed out that modern armed forces must also have strong reserve forces as a backup. The implementation of the compulsory military service system provides a reliable guarantee for our country to establish a strong military service reserve.

    Deputy Liu Wenhui said that judging from his inspection in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, the reason why various places are "short of food" is not actually a shortage of food, but a lack of food and a shortage of food, and it is not the real farmers who are causing the shortage of food, but counter-revolutionary elements and illegal landlords and rich peasants who are inciting the shortage of food. But some people do not analyze various rumors. As soon as they hear someone clamoring for "food shortage," they also join in the clamor. All those who irresponsibly echo those rumors and clamor along with the rumors are unconsciously acting as megaphones for rich peasants, profiteers, and counter-revolutionary elements, and are being fooled by counter-revolutionary elements. He said that he believes that in the future, to understand rural work, we must first comprehensively study various policies, specifically analyze various reflections, find out which class position the rumors are based on, always be vigilant against the activities of the enemy, and also investigate and study the actual situation and use facts to verify. Only in this way can we have the right to speak in rural work, raise vigilance, and be able to distinguish the enemy.

    Bangda Duoji, a Tibetan representative from Changdu Prefecture, talked about the achievements made by the people of Changdu Prefecture in developing agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce and improving people's lives with the help of the Central People's Government in recent years. He pointed out that, especially after the opening of the entire Kangzang and Qingzang highways, the connection between the people of Changdu Prefecture and the people of all parts of the motherland has become closer. Bangda Duoji talked about the various tasks that Changdu Prefecture should carry out in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. He said that an important link in carrying out various tasks in Changdu Prefecture is to train Tibetan political work cadres and technical cadres to create conditions for the establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region in the future and to develop the economic and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan people.

    Yi Shijuan, a model worker in the textile industry, said in her speech that our textile workers must continuously improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce costs, and carry out labor competitions centered on comprehensive conservation, so as to accumulate more funds for the construction of the motherland. He said that in the two years of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, all the workers in his factory—the state-owned Shanghai Second Cotton Textile Factory—enthusiastically launched a labor competition and have achieved remarkable results in production. Yi Shijuan said that in order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we must overcome complacency, conservatism, and backward ideas, strive to improve technology, improve technology, overcome waste, and further tap potential forces.

    Deputy Deng Chumin made a speech on the issue of self-transformation of intellectuals in connection with the issue of "training construction cadres" in the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun. He said that in order to adapt to the needs of national construction and do a good job in the work of training cadres, intellectuals must constantly strive to improve and transform themselves in all aspects. He believes that intellectuals must clearly recognize the socialist political direction ideologically; they must gradually establish a dialectical materialist worldview; and they must strive to cultivate communist moral qualities. These three are indispensable conditions for training well-rounded construction talents.

    Deputy Che Xiangchen's speech talked about the education work in Liaoning Province. He proposed that the current excessive learning burden on primary and secondary school students should be reduced; political education in secondary schools should be strengthened. When he talked about the participation of graduates of senior primary schools and junior middle schools in labor production, he pointed out that representatives of people's congresses at all levels have the responsibility to change the lingering social atmosphere of despising labor, and enthusiastically encourage young people to create a great future for the country and their own happy life with their own hands. Che Xiangchen also hoped that the middle and primary school teachers across the country will further play the exemplary role of people's teachers, be able to set an example by their own conduct, and train new people for socialist construction in a well-rounded way for the motherland.

    Deputy Dong Qiwu talked about the close relationship between prioritizing the development of heavy industry and consolidating national defense in his speech. He said that the higher the people's economic construction rises, the more the enemies at home and abroad will try their best to sabotage it. Therefore, our country's socialist construction must be carried out under the protection of a consolidated national defense; and to establish a consolidated national defense, we must prioritize the development of heavy industry. Only by establishing a strong heavy industry can we strengthen our soldiers who defend the motherland with modern equipment. In this way, our national defense can be more consolidated and peace can be more guaranteed.

    Deputy Ou Baichuan said in his speech that he was excited that the draft Five-Year Plan stipulated various construction matters based on the specific circumstances and conditions of various ethnic minority areas. He said that, taking Guizhou's situation as an example, it is necessary to do a good job in agricultural production, actively develop agricultural production cooperatives, further carry out agricultural production increase movements centered on mutual aid and cooperation, vigorously increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, and actively support the construction of national socialist industrialization.

    Jin Baishan, a representative of Heilongjiang Province from the Xinghuo Collective Farm, used his personal experience to illustrate that if farmers want to finally get rid of poverty and suffering, they must leave the old road of small-scale production that they have been accustomed to for a long time and turn to the new road of collectivized and mechanized socialist agriculture. He said that in the first year of organizing mutual aid groups, the yield per mu of land was 317 jin of rice. After organizing collective farms in 1951, rice production increased greatly. In 1953, the average yield was 754 jin per mu. Last year, although the disaster-affected area reached 20%, the average yield per mu was still 670 jin. With the development of production, the lives of the villagers have also been gradually improved. Jin Baishan said that large-scale collectivization, especially mechanization, of agriculture cannot be achieved without the development of heavy industry. The First Five-Year Plan, which focuses on the development of heavy industry as the center of socialist industrialization, is completely correct.

    Deputy Han Wangchen said that after the private industry and commerce in Xi'an City underwent socialist transformation, production and management have improved, and the government has made arrangements for private commercial employees who cannot continue to operate. These are extremely profound education for private industrialists and businessmen. Many private industrialists and businessmen have realized that as long as they sincerely accept socialist transformation, they have a future.

    Deputy Tong Dizhou said that as a worker in higher education and scientific research, he believes that in the current situation, in order to better complete the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for training construction cadres and strengthening scientific research work, attention should be paid to several issues: First, the formulation of teaching plans must be in line with the actual situation in our country; second, education units, business units, and scientific research units must cooperate closely to solve the problem of the lack of cadres; third, attention should be paid to saving time, and saving time should be regarded as important as saving manpower, materials, and financial resources.

    Deputy Zhang Hanying said that controlling the Yellow River is the ideal pursued by our ancestors for thousands of years and the urgent expectation of the 600 million people of the whole country. Now, only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the ideal of controlling the Yellow River be turned into reality. The water flow and land resources of the Yellow River Basin will serve the people in all aspects of economic construction. This is another major event in our country's economic construction, which will fundamentally change the natural appearance of the Yellow River Basin, which will create favorable conditions for our country to move towards a socialist society and a communist society.

    Deputy Sha Ting focused on describing the criminal activities carried out by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in Sichuan before and after liberation. He said: The struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in Sichuan is very fierce. In this struggle, the vast number of cadres and masses in Sichuan have received a profound education, improved their understanding of the increasingly sharp and complex class struggle during the transition period, and recognized that the hidden enemy, characterized by the use of double-dealing tactics, is more dangerous than the open enemy with guns. He said: The unanimous voice of the people of Sichuan is: severely punish Hu Feng and his backbone members, and cleanse all hidden counter-revolutionary elements from the people's interior.

    Deputy Wang Yanan said that he studies economic science. After studying the draft of the First Five-Year Plan, he regarded the plan as a scientific model of Marxism because it does not carry any illusions and is completely based on reliable facts and solid scientific arguments. He believes that the plan itself and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the First Five-Year Plan will not only have a great guiding role in China's economic circles, but also become an important document to encourage the people of the whole country and improve the ideological awareness of the people of the whole country.

    Today's executive chairmen of the meeting are: Chen Shutong, Nie Rongzhen, Gao Chongmin, Wang Weizhou, Zhu Dehai, and Long Yun.

    Today's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and adjourned at 7:10 p.m. The meeting will be adjourned for one day tomorrow. The general discussion will continue on the 29th.

专栏：

    全国人民代表大会代表继续发言
    新华社二十七日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天继续由全国人民代表大会代表和国家机关各部门负责人就本次会议的各项主要议程发言。
    今天在会上发言的有薄一波、张难先、邵力子、吴耀宗、俞平伯、李纯青、盛丕华、曹禺、罗瑞卿、叶剑英、刘文辉、邦达多吉、裔式娟、邓初民、车向忱、董其武、欧百川、金白山、韩望尘、童第周、张含英、沙汀、王亚南等二十三人。
    国务院第三办公室主任兼国家建设委员会主任薄一波就五年计划中发展重工业的问题作了发言。他说，第一个五年计划规定优先发展重工业，并以工业投资的百分之八十八点八来建设重工业是完全符合党在过渡时期总路线的要求和全国人民的根本利益的。解放以来重工业有了很大的发展，但是同国家需要相比较，重工业的水平还很落后。薄一波在发言中对五年计划中重工业部门必须解决的几个主要问题，如关于重工业的技术改造和掌握新技术，开展工业标准化的工作，重工业的计划安排、专业化和协作配合，改进企业管理、贯彻增产节约、提高劳动生产率，培养技术力量等问题，都详细地作了说明。
    薄一波说，由于我国重工业基础差、经验不足，解决上述问题是会遇到许多困难的。但是我们有苏联和人民民主国家的援助，有广大工人、技术人员和干部的高度建设热情，只要我们认真学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验，做好企业的政治思想工作，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，五年计划规定的重工业建设和生产任务是一定能够完成的。
    薄一波最后指出：在重工业建设的繁重工作中，必须保持高度的警惕性，坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫重工业建设的成果。
    张难先代表在发言中用他在武汉市视察所见的许多事例，证明在城市中粮食都很充裕，而且给市民核定的每月粮食供应量，一般都很宽，超过每人每月的正常食量。他说，政府定量供应的标准应是既要做到个个人都吃得饱，而又不浪费粮食。
    邵力子代表说，他在解放以前痛心于蒋介石破坏孙中山先生的三大政策，心里常是忧愁苦闷，身体健康也受到损害；解放以来，眼见全国大陆得到和平统一，经济恢复以后开始有计划的和平建设，中国人民不只自己享受和平幸福，还能担负起保卫世界和平的责任，精神上无比愉快，身体自然健旺。他说：看我这实在的例子，在台湾的人可以不再听信谣言，说在大陆的人怎样痛苦了。他说，我们每个人都应当提高政治警惕性和思想觉悟，勤恳工作，紧密团结，为完成第一个五年计划而努力奋斗。
    吴耀宗代表说：第一个五年计划对保卫世界和平有重要的意义。没有比第一个五年计划更能雄辩地说明新中国和平意图的事实。他又说：第一个五年计划是开始改变中国的面貌，为全国人民，为我们的子子孙孙创造无穷幸福的伟大计划。他表示全国基督徒衷心拥护这个计划，并愿意为这个计划的实施，献出最大的力量。
    俞平伯代表在发言中感谢全国各地在批判“红楼梦研究”一书中对他的帮助。他说，经过这次批评以后深深感到旧知识分子必须积极地改造，才能对社会主义建设事业出一把力。这次严肃尖锐的思想斗争，使他懂得了几十年来所不认识的唯心主义的错误。俞平伯说，他在这次思想斗争中得到的收获是很大的，他初步地学习了马克思列宁主义，认识了资产阶级的文艺理论的危害性，端正了文学研究的方向。他又说，共产党和民主党派的负责同志和文艺界的朋友们对他的关怀和帮助，使他非常感动。使他具体领会到共产党对知识分子一面团结、一面改造的政策是完全正确的。
    李纯青代表在发言中表达了台湾人民对国家开始实行第一个五年计划的心情。他说：在中国几乎没有工业的时候，日本抢去了台湾。台湾同胞受尽苦难，深知国家工业化的重要。曾经失掉祖国五十年、现在还不能受到祖国保护的台湾人，是多么需要一个富强的中国。他相信，台湾同胞拥护五年计划的感情是深刻的，要求五年计划实现的愿望是迫切的。
    他说：对台湾同胞来说，眼前的事实是残酷的：在祖国人民欢欣鼓舞的今天，他们生活在苦难中。现在，他们仍然在为回到自己的祖国——中华人民共和国的怀抱里来，而不屈服地作英勇的斗争。台湾同胞坚决反对美国侵占台湾，他们过去不做日本的奴隶，今天也绝不做美国的奴隶。台湾同胞拥护祖国解放台湾的一切决策，日日夜夜盼望着解放时日的到来。李纯青说：五年计划的事业胜利前进，台湾也就一天天地接近解放。台湾是一定会解放的，台湾人民是一定要回来的。
    盛丕华代表在发言中指出，在社会主义改造中要加强对私营工商业者的思想教育工作。他说，有不少的私营工商业者，对企业改造必须结合个人思想改造的重要意义是认识不足的。今后应当推动私营工商业者努力学习，端正认识，服从国家计划，厉行节约，消灭浪费，为国家建设积累资金，做好国家委托的任务。他同时希望国营经济部门工作人员在领导私营工商业改造企业的过程中，注意加强对资本家个人思想改造的领导。
    曹禺代表的发言首先表示感谢党和政府及时揭露了胡风反革命集团，逮捕审讯了胡风这个罪大恶极的反革命分子。他说，这个大快人心的举动不只说明我们的政府是最民主的政府，也是最有力量的政府。他还谈到他个人从胡风事件中得到的两点体会：第一、要警惕一切反革命分子，首先要警惕自己的个人主义和自由主义。因为“个人主义与自由主义是反革命分子的好朋友”。第二、必须更要靠拢党和政府，必须对党和政府做到绝对的忠诚老实。他说，当所有的好人都完完全全向党靠拢了，那暗藏的反革命分子就会被孤立起来，失掉了藏身之地。
    国务院第一办公室主任兼公安部长罗瑞卿对肃清反革命分子的问题，在会上作了发言。
    罗瑞卿首先以最近时期反革命分子进行活动的事例，说明反革命分子正在千方百计地破坏人民的安全和财产、破坏社会主义建设、妄想颠覆中华人民共和国。
    罗瑞卿在分析了反革命活动嚣张的种种原因之后说，一九五一年的镇压反革命运动得到了伟大的成绩，但是我们应该看到，那次运动的主要锋芒是对着公开的反革命分子，暗藏的反革命分子被发现和镇压的并不多，而敌人今天的主要活动方式却是暗藏的。
    罗瑞卿说，为了肃清反革命分子，首先要提高警惕。我们必须时时刻刻用提高革命警惕性的任务来教育共产党员、青年团员，教育各民主党派各人民团体的成员，教育国家机关的全体工作人员，教育全国人民。只有这样，我们才能严密各种制度，堵塞各种可以给反革命分子利用的漏洞，才能及时地发现反革命分子而加以肃清。
    罗瑞卿说，为了肃清反革命分子必须发动群众，使保卫治安的专门工作同群众斗争相结合。必须坚持贯彻正确的政策。必须严格划清反革命分子的界限。毛主席关于“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的指示，必须成为全国公安机关以及全国人民在镇压反革命斗争中的指南针。他同时指出：国家在处理反革命分子问题上的政策，仍然是镇压和宽大相结合。我们要求一切犯罪分子向政府坦白地说明自己的罪过，并且帮助政府查清其他犯罪分子的事实，在这一方面，我们的原则是：抗拒者从严，坦白者从宽，立功者可以将功折罪。罗瑞卿的发言一再激起全体代表的热烈鼓掌。
    叶剑英代表在发言中就巩固国防问题发表意见。他说：我国的社会主义建设需要有一个长期的国际和平环境。为着保卫祖国与人民的安全，保卫祖国社会主义建设，解放我国领土台湾，中国人民和中国人民解放军必须有充分的戒备和警惕。必须采取各种可能的措施，继续加强中国人民解放军，用足够数量的最新式的现代装备来武装中国人民解放军。为此就必须加速发展我国的工业，特别是重工业。他指出：现代的武装力量，还要有雄厚的兵源作后备。义务兵役制的实行，为我国建立强大的兵役后备，提供了可靠的保证。
    刘文辉代表说，从他这次在四川省温江专区视察的情况看来，各地所以“闹缺粮”，事实上决不是缺粮闹粮，而是有粮闹粮，不是真正的农民在闹粮，而是反革命分子和不法地主、富农在煽动闹粮。但有些人对于各种流言，不加分析，一听到有人叫嚣“缺粮”，也就跟着起哄。所有这些不负责任地附和那些流言，跟着流言叫嚣的人，是不自觉地做了富农、奸商、反革命分子的传声筒，上了反革命分子的当。他说，他以为今后要了解农村工作，一定要先全面地研究各项政策，要具体地分析各种反映，搞清楚那些流言是从什么阶级立场的利益出发的，时刻警惕着敌人的活动，还要调查研究实际情况，用事实来对证。只有这样，才有对农村工作的发言权，才能提高警惕，才能辨别敌人。
    昌都地区的藏族代表邦达多吉在发言中谈到几年来昌都地区人民在中央人民政府的帮助下，在发展农牧工商业和改善人民生活方面所取得的成就。他指出，特别是康藏、青藏公路全线通车后，使昌都地区人民和祖国各地人民的联系更加密切了。邦达多吉谈到在执行第一个五年计划中，昌都地区所应该进行的各项工作。他说，昌都地区在进行各项工作中的一个重要环节是，培养藏族的政治工作干部和技术干部，为将来成立统一的西藏自治区，发展藏族人民的经济、文化事业创造条件。
    纺织工业劳动模范裔式娟代表在发言中说，我们纺织工人要不断提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本，开展以全面节约为中心的劳动竞赛，为祖国建设积累更多的资金。他说，在贯彻第一个五年计划的两年多中，她所在的厂——国营上海第二棉纺织厂的全体工人热烈开展了劳动竞赛，已在生产上获得了显著成绩。裔式娟说，为了保证完成和提前完成五年计划，我们必须克服骄傲自满、保守落后的思想，努力提高技术、改进技术，克服浪费现象，进一步发掘潜在力量。
    邓初民代表就李富春副总理报告中“关于培养建设干部问题”联系到知识分子的自我改造问题作了发言。他说，知识分子为着适应国家建设的需要，做好培养干部的工作，就必需在各方面不断努力提高自己，改造自己。他认为，知识分子必须从思想上明确认识社会主义的政治方向；必须逐步树立辩证唯物主义的世界观；努力培养共产主义的道德品质。这三者是培养全面发展的建设人材所不可缺少的条件。
    车向忱代表的发言谈到了辽宁省的教育工作问题。他提出，应该减轻目前中小学生过重的学习负担；应该加强中等学校的政治教育。他在谈到高小和初中毕业生参加劳动生产的问题时指出，各级人民代表大会代表都有责任转移社会上残留的轻视劳动的风气，而热情鼓励青年们用自己的双手创造国家的伟大前途和自己的幸福生活。车向忱并希望全国中、小学教师进一步发挥人民教师的模范作用，能以身作则，为祖国培养全面发展的社会主义建设的新人。
    董其武代表在发言中谈到优先发展重工业和巩固国防的密切关系。他说，人民经济建设愈高涨，国内外的敌人愈要千方百计地来破坏。因此，我国的社会主义建设事业，必须在巩固的国防保卫下来进行；而要建立巩固的国防，就必须优先发展重工业。只有建立起强大的重工业，才能用现代化的装备来加强我们保卫祖国的战士。这样，才能使我们的国防更加巩固，和平更有保障。
    欧百川代表在发言时表示，他为五年计划草案中根据各少数民族地区的具体情况和条件规定了各种建设事项而感到兴奋。他说，以贵州情况来说，必须搞好农业生产，积极发展农业生产合作社，进一步开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，大力增产粮食和工业原料，积极支援国家社会主义工业化的建设。
    来自星火集体农庄的黑龙江省代表金白山以亲身的经历，说明农民要最后摆脱贫穷和痛苦，必须离开过去长期走惯了的小生产的旧道路，而转向集体化和机械化的社会主义农业的新道路。他说，他们在组织互助组的第一年，每亩地的产量是三百十七斤水稻。一九五一年组织集体农庄后，水稻产量大为增加，一九五三年平均每亩收七百五十四斤，去年虽然受灾面积达百分之二十，每亩平均产量还收到六百七十斤。随着生产的发展，庄员们生活也得到逐步改善。金白山说，农业的大规模的集体化特别是机械化，没有重工业的发展是不行的。第一个五年计划中以发展重工业为社会主义工业化的中心，是完全正确的。
    韩望尘代表说，西安市私营工商业进行社会主义改造后，生产和经营有了改善，政府对不能继续经营的私营商业从业人员都作了安置。这些，对于私营工商业者是一次极深刻的教育。很多私营工商业者体会到，只要自己诚心诚意地接受社会主义改造，他们是有前途的。
    童第周代表说，作为一个高等教育和科学研究工作者，他认为在目前的情况下，要更好地完成五年计划中所规定的培养建设干部和加强科学研究工作的任务，应当注意几个问题：一、教学计划的制定，要切合我国的实际情况；二、教育单位、企业单位和科学研究单位要密切合作，解决干部缺乏的问题；三、要重视时间的节约，把节约时间看得和节约人力、物力、财力一样重要。
    张含英代表说，根治黄河是我们祖先几千年来所追求的理想，是全国六万万人民迫切的期望。现在，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，根治黄河的理想才能变为现实。黄河流域的水流和土地资源，就要在经济建设的各方面为人民服务了。这是我国经济建设事业上又一个重大的事件，它将从根本上改变黄河流域的自然面貌，它将为我国走向社会主义社会、共产主义社会创造有利的条件。
    沙汀代表在发言中着重叙述了胡风反革命集团在四川解放前后进行的罪恶活动。他说：在四川进行的肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争，是十分剧烈的。在这一斗争中，四川的广大干部和群众都受到了深刻的教育，提高了自己对于过渡时期阶级斗争日益尖锐复杂的认识，认清了以使用两面派手法为其特征的隐蔽的敌人，比拿枪的公开的敌人还更危险。他说：四川人民一致的呼声是：严厉惩办胡风及其骨干分子，把一切暗藏的反革命分子从人民内部清洗出去。
    王亚南代表说，他是研究经济科学的，他在研究了第一个五年计划草案以后，把这计划看成是马克思主义的科学范本，因为它不带一点幻想，完全建立在可靠的事实和坚实的科学论据上面的。他认为，这个计划本身及李富春副总理关于第一个五年计划的报告，不仅会对中国经济学界发生极大的指导作用，同时将成为鼓舞全国人民，提高全国人民思想认识水平的重要文件。
    今天会议的执行主席是：陈叔通、聂荣臻、高崇民、王维舟、朱德海、龙云。
    今天的会议下午三时开始，七时十分休会。明天休会一天。二十九日继续进行大会讨论。
