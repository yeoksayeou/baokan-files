    Turning Saline-Alkali Land into Fertile Fields

    The Yinchuan area of Gansu Province is a vast alluvial plain of the Yellow River, a land of rice and wheat production. A long time ago, the farmers here diverted water from the Yellow River to irrigate farmland along both banks, creating favorable conditions for developing agricultural production. However, most of the land in the irrigated area contains varying degrees of saline-alkali content, which has become an obstacle to further increasing crop yields.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of the Yinchuan area have launched an arduous and complex struggle against the natural disaster of soil salinization. Based on the method of combining water conservancy soil improvement with agricultural soil improvement, the People's Government has established a sound drainage system and scientific irrigation management system in this irrigated area, which stretches for hundreds of miles. It has vigorously promoted rational irrigation and economical water use among the masses of farmers, correcting the past bad habit of flood irrigation. A system of "slightly upward, high first and then low, intermittent rotation irrigation" has been implemented in all channels. In many areas, water is allocated according to the nature of the soil, the characteristics of the crops, and the planting area. This set of scientific irrigation system ensures that crops receive the necessary moisture, lowers the groundwater level, and prevents the saline-alkali substances in the stratum from being brought to the surface to harm crop growth.

    Changing the farmers' habit of flood irrigation for many years is not an easy task. In the beginning, some farmers were skeptical of this approach, believing that soil salinization was impossible to change. However, vivid facts made them believe that creative labor can overcome disasters and change the face of nature. In 1954, a comparative experiment of economical water use, frequent shallow irrigation, and flood irrigation was conducted at the Yongning Wang Taibao Farm. The results showed that the farmland with frequent shallow irrigation had the highest yield. In this experiment, spring wheat was irrigated three times per mu, each time without water accumulation on the ground, with a total irrigation of 134.2 cubic meters, and a yield of more than 484 jin. The land with flood irrigation was irrigated with 259 cubic meters per mu, and the yield was only more than 390 jin. The soil quality, fertilizer, variety, and cultivation methods of these two experimental fields were the same, but the crop yield was greatly increased simply by changing the irrigation method and reducing the degree of soil salinization.

    In the past, although there were crisscrossing canals in the Yinchuan irrigation area, there was no complete drainage ditch. As a result of flood irrigation, the alkalization degree of many farmlands became more and more serious. After liberation, the government actively reorganized the existing ditches and built new drainage systems. Preliminary estimates show that the drainage area can reach more than 2.74 million mu, and hundreds of thousands of mu of lake fields can be reclaimed for planting. Now, the degree of salinization in the farmland along these main and branch drainage ditches has been greatly reduced. In order to further combat soil salinization, the drainage project in the Yinchuan irrigation area is still being expanded in a planned manner, and many scientists are carrying out the struggle to change the face of nature here. Ninety-nine groundwater observation wells have been set up in an area of about 400 square kilometers from Yinchuan to Yaofubao in Pingluo County, and water gauges have been installed in canals, lakes, and the Yellow River to observe water level rises and falls and compare them with groundwater level rises and falls to provide reliable data for the construction of drainage systems.

    In the struggle against soil salinization, the Yinchuan area has also adopted a series of agricultural measures, implemented deep plowing and close planting to prevent soil moisture evaporation and lower the groundwater level, and divided rice planting areas and alkali-resistant crop planting areas in some areas. The improvement of agricultural operation techniques has also played a significant role in preventing and changing soil salinization.

    The natural landscape of the Yinchuan irrigation area is changing day by day. The former alkaline land is gradually turning into fertile fields. The beautiful and rich "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall" has become even more fertile. Lu Jiang

    把盐碱土地变成良田
    甘肃省银川地区是一片辽阔的黄河冲积平原，是一个盛产稻米、小麦的米粮川。很早以前，这里的农民就沿黄河两岸开渠引水灌溉农田，创造了发展农业生产的优越条件；可是，灌溉区里的大部分土地都含有程度不同的盐碱质，成为进一步提高农作物产量的障碍。
    解放以后，银川地区的人民在人民政府的领导下向土壤盐碱化的自然灾害展开了艰巨而复杂的斗争。人民政府根据水利土壤改良和农业土壤改良相结合的方法，在这片纵横数百里的灌溉区内，建立了健全的排水系统和科学的灌溉管理制度，在农民群众中大力提倡合理灌溉，经济用水，纠正了过去大水漫灌的不良习惯。在各个渠道上，都实行了“由稍向上，先高后低，间段轮灌”的制度。在许多地区，根据土壤的性质、作物的特点和种植面积，实行计划配水。这一套科学的灌溉制度，保证了农作物能得到必要的水份，降低了地下水位，使得地层中的盐碱质不致被带到地面上来危害农作物的生长。
    改变农民多年来大水浇田的习惯，是一件很不容易的事情。开始的时候，有些农民怀疑这种作法，他们认为土壤的盐碱化是没有办法改变的。但是，生动的事实使得他们不能不相信，创造性的劳动是能够战胜灾害改变自然面貌的。一九五四年，在永宁王泰堡农场进行了一次经济用水、勤浇浅灌和大水漫灌的对比试验，结果证明勤浇浅灌的农田产量最高。这次试验中，每亩春小麦灌溉三次，每次灌水都不使地上有积水，共灌水一百三十四点二公方，产量在四百八十四斤以上；而大水漫灌的土地，每亩灌水二百五十九公方，产量仅三百九十多斤。这两块试验田的土质、肥料、品种和耕作方法等都是相同的，仅仅由于改变了灌溉方法，减轻了土壤的盐碱化程度，就使得农作物的产量大大增加。
    过去，银川灌溉区虽然渠道纵横，却没有一条完整的排水沟，由于大水漫灌的结果，许多农田的碱化程度一天比一天严重起来。解放以后，政府积极整理旧有水沟和修建新的排水系统，初步估计排水面积可达二百七十四万多亩，并且可以使几十万亩的湖田开垦种植。现在沿着这些排水干沟和支干沟的农田的盐碱化程度已经大大减轻。为了进一步战胜土壤盐碱化，银川灌溉区的排水工程还在有计划地增建中，许多科学工作者在这里进行着改变自然面貌的斗争。在银川到平罗县姚伏堡一带约四百平方公里的面积上，已经设置了地下水观测井九十九眼，并且在渠道、湖泊和黄河上，安设了水尺，以观测水位涨落和地下水位的升降作联系比较，为修建排水系统提供可靠的资料。
    在同土壤盐碱化作斗争中，银川地区还采取了一系列的农业措施，实行深耕密植，防止土壤中的水份蒸发和降低地下水位，并且在一部分地区划分了水稻种植区和种植耐碱作物区。农业操作技术的改良，对于防止和改变土壤盐碱化也起了很大的作用。
    银川灌溉区的自然面貌正在一天一天地改变着。过去的碱滩正逐渐变成良田。美丽富饶的“塞上江南”变得更加肥美了。　陆江
