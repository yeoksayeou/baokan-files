We, women and mothers from sixty-six countries, speaking different languages, with different customs and religious beliefs, different viewpoints and social positions, gathered together in Lausanne for the first time from July 7th to 10th, 1955, to hold the World Mothers' Congress.

We came here with only one intention: to protect our children from war and ensure them a peaceful and happy future.

At our Congress, we heard again the suffering endured during the war years. We cannot forget the tears of mothers, the suffering, pain, and misfortune of children—all brought about by World War II. More than forty million people were killed, more than thirty million were injured and disabled, millions of children were orphaned, millions died of hunger and poverty, how many towns and villages were destroyed, how many homes were ruined! How many hopes were dashed, how many talented people sacrificed, how much happiness was destroyed!

The firm determination to prevent another war that arose from this suffering led us to attend this Congress. Here, we understood each other better, forgave each other, and loved each other. We recognized how enormous a force we are, and how insignificant the things that separate us are compared to the things that unite us. We felt even more strongly that there is no reason for the people of different countries to be hostile to each other. The world is large enough for everyone to find their place and live a peaceful life.

However, as long as the arms race continues, as long as military blocs are still being established, as long as violence is still used and war propaganda is carried out, as long as atomic weapons are still being stockpiled and tested, as long as there is no trust and coordination between countries, peace is in danger, and mothers are in a state of unease. The people of all countries have the right to live freely, and the national independence of all countries must be respected. This is the only way to guarantee peace!

We now know that war is not inevitable, that war can be avoided, and that peace can be achieved.

The will of the people of all countries brought the wars in Korea and Vietnam to an end; the Bandung Conference of the Ten Principles has shown that peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems is possible; the signing of the Austrian State Treaty proves that a great step forward has been made in peacefully resolving conflicts; and overcoming differences on the issue of disarmament has become increasingly possible.

These initial victories have been achieved through the joint and tireless efforts of peace-loving people in all countries. Let us contribute the great strength of our maternal love to the people who are defending life and peace.

Women make up half of humanity. We must recognize our responsibility to children and to the people of all countries.

Let us call upon all women, call upon all mothers, to guide them to participate in the struggle for peace.

Let us appeal to the emotions and reason of those who have not yet stood with us. Let us tell those who have not yet recognized the danger: it is not enough to just love children, one must protect children from war.

Let us issue a call to those who are also working for peace but have not taken joint action. Isolated and divided, we can do nothing. United, we are invincible.

Women of all countries!

The World Mothers' Congress earnestly hopes that we will take concerted action. We all know how much effort and spirit it takes to raise a child and bring them to adulthood. We do not want the lives we have nurtured to be destroyed.

We do not want war.

Let our voices spread more and more powerfully; let us angrily reject the idea that atomic weapons might be used, let us demand the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons. We demand that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes.

At a time when more than half of humanity is still suffering from hunger, we cannot agree to war preparations swallowing up huge amounts of funds.

Let us achieve disarmament, let us demand that military allocations be used to build housing, hospitals, schools, and maternity hospitals, and to improve the condition of children.

All the wealth in the world must be used to serve the improvement of living standards.

It is not enough to express one's wishes in words. Let us take action until we reach our goals.

Women of all countries!

We do not want our sons to kill each other.

Let us educate our children in the spirit of loving the people of all countries, and not allow their hearts to be tainted by hatred and racial prejudice.

All children—white, yellow, and black—are equal, have equal rights to life, and it is urgent to protect them all.

The World Mothers' Congress is a vivid manifestation of the great friendship between all women in the world.

In order to defend our children from war, in order to strive for disarmament and friendship between the people of all countries, let us ensure that we maintain unity and expand our contacts.

There are millions upon millions of us, let us reach out to each other!

### 世界母亲大会宣言

    世界母亲大会宣言
    我们，来自六十六个国家、说着不同语言、有着不同的风俗习惯和宗教信仰、不同的观点和社会地位的妇女和母亲们，从一九五五年七月七日到十日在洛桑第一次聚会一堂，举行世界母亲大会。
    我们是只抱着一个意愿来到这里的，那就是要保护我们的孩子免遭战争，保证他们有一个和平和幸福的未来。
    在我们的大会上，我们再次听到在战争年代所经受过的苦难。我们不能忘记母亲们的眼泪，孩子们遭受的苦难、痛苦和不幸——第二次世界大战所带来的一切。四千多万人被杀害，三千多万人受伤残废，成百万孩子成为孤儿，成百万人死于饥饿和贫困，多少城镇和乡村被毁灭，多少家园被破坏！多少希望破灭了，多少有才能的人牺牲了，多少幸福被破坏了！
    从这种苦难中产生的制止另一次大战的坚定决心使我们前来参加这次大会。在这里，我们彼此更加了解了，彼此谅解，彼此相爱了。我们认识到我们是多么巨大的一支力量，使我们彼此分离的东西比起使我们团结一致的东西来是多么微不足道。我们更加强烈地感到各国人民毫无理由彼此敌对。世界之大足以使每一个人都能够找到自己的地方，过和平的生活。
    但是，只要军备竞赛还在继续进行，只要军事集团还在建立，只要还在使用暴力和进行战争宣传，只要还在储存和试验原子武器，只要国与国之间没有信任和协调，和平就处在危险之中，母亲们就处于不安状态中。各国人民都有权利自由地生活，必须尊重各国的民族独立。这是保障和平的唯一的道路！
    我们现在知道，战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以避免的，和平是可以获得的。
    各国人民的意志使得朝鲜和越南的战争停止；通过十项原则的万隆会议已经表明，具有不同制度的国家和平共处是可能的；奥地利国家条约的签订证明了在和平解决矛盾方面已经获得一个巨大的进展；克服裁军问题上的分歧已经愈来愈有可能办到。
    这些初步的胜利是由于各国爱好和平的人民的共同的不倦的努力而取得的。让我们把我们的母爱的伟大力量贡献给正在保卫生活与和平的人们吧。
    妇女占人类的半数。我们必须认识到我们对儿童、对各国人民的责任。
    让我们号召全体妇女，号召全体母亲，引导她们参加争取和平的斗争吧。
    让我们向那些还没有同我们站在一起的人的感情和理智呼吁吧。让我们告诉那些还没有认清危险的人：光是爱儿童是不够的，人们必须保护儿童免遭战争。
    让我们向那些也为争取和平而工作但是没有采取联合行动的人们发出号召吧。孤立起来和分割开来，我们就不能做任何事情。团结起来，我们就是不可战胜的。
    各国的妇女们！
    世界母亲大会热烈地希望我们将采取一致行动。我们大家都知道抚育一个孩子，使他长大成人，需要花费多少心血和精神。我们不希望我们孕育的生命被毁灭。
    我们不要战争。
    让我们的声音愈来愈有力地传播出去；让我们对原子武器可能被使用的想法都愤怒地加以摈斥，让我们要求禁止和销毁原子武器。我们要求原子能只用于和平用途。
    在半数以上的人类还在忍饥受饿的时候，我们不能同意准备战争的活动吞没巨额经费。
    让我们来实现裁减军备吧，让我们要求把军备拨款用来建设住宅、医院、学校和产科医院，用来改善孩子们的境况吧。
    世界上的一切财富都必须用来为提高生活水平服务。
    单是用言词来表示一个人的意愿是不够的。让我们行动起来，直到我们达到我们的目标。
    各国妇女们！
    我们不希望我们的儿子们互相残杀。
    让我们以爱一切国家的人民的精神来教养我们的孩子，不要使他们的心灵为憎恨和种族偏见所玷污。
    一切儿童——白种、黄种和黑种的——都是平等的，都有平等的生活权利，保护他们全体是迫切需要的。
    世界母亲大会是全世界所有的妇女之间的伟大友谊的生动表现。
    为了保卫我们的孩子免遭战争，为了争取裁军和各国人民之间友好，让我们保证保持团结和扩大我们的联系。
    我们的人数有千千万万，让我们相互伸出手来吧！
