Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 7th: Brussels dispatch: The Chinese Art Troupe held its first performance at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels on the 5th. More than 1,200 spectators watched the performance, and they warmly welcomed the Peking Opera, dance and other programs performed by the art troupe.

After the performance, the Belgian "International Performing Arts Exchange Center" held a reception to celebrate the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe. More than 400 people attended the reception, including Belgian Minister of Education and Art Collard, Minister of Interior Vermeylen, former Minister of Colonies Wigny, former Minister of Foreign Affairs De Smets, as well as the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, the United Kingdom, and Indonesia to Belgium, and well-known figures from the cultural and artistic circles of Brussels. Attendees repeatedly toasted to the success of the Chinese Art Troupe's performance.

On the 6th, major newspapers in Brussels published extensive reviews of the Chinese Art Troupe's performance and published performance photos. The "Soir," which has a wide circulation, said: "Brussels is not like Paris. It did not anticipate the arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe in advance, and therefore was not prepared to accept something new. However, it still warmly welcomed the Chinese Art Troupe and understood it through the performance of each item on the program. Although the performance form of the Chinese Art Troupe is completely new to the West, people can still appreciate it very well. If you pay attention, you will find outstanding creativity." The "Modern Newspaper" commented: The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe opens the door for us to contact new things.

　　我国艺术团在布鲁塞尔举行首次演出
    新华社布拉格七日电　布鲁塞尔消息：中国艺术团五日在布鲁塞尔的蒙奈皇家剧院举行首次演出。观看这次演出的观众有一千二百人以上，他们对艺术团演出的京剧、舞蹈及其他节目表示热烈欢迎。
    演出后，比利时“国际表演观摩交流中心”举行酒会，庆祝中国艺术团的演出。出席酒会的有四百余人，其中有比利时教育与艺术大臣柯拉，内政大臣维尔梅朗，前殖民大臣魏格尼，前外交大臣德斯梅尔以及苏联、波兰、匈牙利、英国和印度尼西亚驻比利时的大使和布鲁塞尔的文化、艺术界知名人士等。出席酒会的人一再为中国艺术团演出的成功而干杯。
    六日，布鲁塞尔各大报以巨大篇幅发表了关于中国艺术团演出的评论，并且刊载了演出照片。发行甚广的“晚报”说：“布鲁塞尔不像巴黎，它事先并没有预料中国艺术团前来，因而也没有准备接受一种新事物。但是，它仍然给中国艺术团以热烈欢迎，并且通过节目单上的每个项目的表演而了解了它。尽管中国艺术团的表演形式对西方来说是全新的，但是人们仍然能够很好地欣赏。如果你注意，就会发现出卓越的创造。”“现代报”评论说：中国艺术团的表演给我们打开了接触新事物的大门。
