　　An Encounter of a Tower Crane
　　By our reporter Zhu Bo
　　In the construction site of the Fifth Engineering Company of the Northwest Engineering Bureau in Xi'an, you can see dozens of workers laboriously carrying precast concrete components weighing two thousand kilograms upstairs for installation. At the same time, you can also see a tower crane lying nearby in pieces.

　　This tower crane was shipped from Shanghai last October. It is a very useful hoisting machine in construction engineering, 30 meters high and weighing 45 tons. It can lift various precast components weighing up to 6 tons. It can play a big role in building large factories and high-rise buildings of four stories or more.

　　In Xi'an, there had never been such a new type of machine before. Many construction workers had never even heard of it, so they were very excited when this tower crane arrived. The workers who were installing large precast concrete components were even happier, thinking that installing precast concrete components would be much easier in the future. However, after the technicians inspected it, they found that the crane could not be used because it was missing thirty or forty kinds of accessories. The personnel responsible for purchasing this tower crane had not expected that so many accessories would be needed.

　　What to do? To purchase accessories, an investment of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan would be needed. Since it was not budgeted in advance, where would the money come from? So, the tower crane had to be shelved for a long time.

　　There was no warehouse on the construction site. The crane was dismantled and placed in the open air, exposed to the wind and rain. As time went by, the gray paint of the machine began to peel off, and many places had already rusted. Workers passing by who saw this crane said indignantly: It can't speak, but if it could, it would have cursed those bureaucratic elements long ago!

　　More and more people complained about this crane, and the Fifth Engineering Company had no choice but to transport it back from the construction site and store it at the company's machinery station. However, at the machinery station, the tower crane was still exposed to the wind and rain just like at the construction site.

　　In May of this year, this tower crane was transferred to the Third Engineering Company. When the personnel of the Machinery Section of the Third Engineering Company accepted the tower crane, they found that it had been completely changed: the gray paint had peeled off, and a layer of rust had grown in the places where the paint had peeled off; the top of the crane was bent; and a crack had been broken in the motor. Although the Northwest Engineering Bureau required the Third Engineering Company to install the tower crane in June, the Third Engineering Company only made a budget for purchasing accessories in early June, and had not sent anyone to purchase the accessories by mid-June. It can be said with certainty that this crane will be shelved for another period of time.

　　This crane, from its manufacture to its transportation to Xi'an, consumed the labor of thousands of workers and occupied more than 100,000 yuan of state funds. Many construction departments that urgently need this crane cannot buy it, but here it is shelved and allowed to be damaged. Shouldn't the relevant personnel of the Northwest Engineering Bureau, who are responsible for this crane, feel that this is a criminal act of wasting state funds?

### 一台塔式起重机的遭遇

　　一台塔式起重机的遭遇
　　本报记者　朱波
　　在西安的西北工程管理局第五工程公司的工地里，你可以看到几十个工人非常吃力地把两千公斤重的混凝土预制构件，抬上楼去安装，同时你又可以看到就在附近有一台塔式起重机，四分五裂地躺着。
    这台塔式起重机是去年十月从上海运来的。它是建筑工程上用处很大的一种起重机械，机身高三十公尺；重四十五吨。它可以起重六吨重的各种预制构件。建设大型的厂房和四层楼以上的高层建筑时，它都能够发挥很大作用。
    在西安，过去还没有这种新型的机械。许多建筑工人连听都没听说过，所以，这台塔式起重机运来的时候，他们非常兴奋。正在安装大型混凝土预制构件的工人们更加高兴，以为以后安装混凝土预制构件要省事得多了。但是，技术人员检查一番以后，发现起重机不能用，因为还缺少三、四十种配件。负责购买这台塔式起重机的人员，根本没有想到还需要这么多的配件。
    怎么办呢？要购买配件，就需要四、五万元的投资。事先没作出预算，钱从哪里来呢？于是，只好把塔式起重机长期搁置下来了。
    工地上没有仓库。起重机就被拆开放在露天地方，任凭风吹雨打。日子一久，机器的灰色的漆皮开始脱落，不少地方已经生了锈。过往的工人看到这台起重机，就愤愤不平地说：它不会说话，如果会说话，早就痛骂那些官僚主义分子啦！
    替这台起重机抱不平的人越来越多，第五工程公司不得不把它从工地里运回来，存放在公司的机具站上。但是，在机具站上，塔式起重机也跟在工地一样任凭风吹雨打。
    今年五月份，这台塔式起重机被调拨给第三工程公司了。第三工程公司机械科的人员接受这台塔式起重机时，发现它已经面貌全非了：灰色油漆剥落了，在油漆剥落的地方生了一层锈；起重机上边的塔尖被碰弯了；马达被摔裂了一道缝。西北工程管理局虽然要求第三工程公司在六月份把塔式起重机安装起来，但是第三工程公司六月初才作出购买配件的预算，直到六月中旬还没有派人去购买配件。可以肯定地说：这台起重机还要搁置一个时期。
    这台起重机从制造出来直到运来西安，耗费了千百个工人的劳力，占用了十多万元的国家资金。很多急需这种起重机的施工部门没法买到，而这里却把这台起重机搁置起来，任它损坏。应该对这台起重机负责的西北工程管理局的有关人员们，难道你们一点都不感觉到这是一种浪费国家资金的罪恶行为吗？
