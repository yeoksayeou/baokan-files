The Ministry of Forestry issued a "Notice on Seizing the Season to Vigorously Lead and Organize the Masses to Reclaim and Nurture Camellia Oleifera Forests" in late June. The notice stated: In recent years, China's tea oil production has greatly improved, but it has not yet reached the highest pre-war production level. About half of the country's Camellia oleifera forests are barren, and the nurturing of the reclaimed Camellia oleifera forests is also very poor, with very low average yield per mu. Therefore, it is necessary to actively mobilize and organize the broad masses of farmers to carry out the reclamation and nurturing of Camellia oleifera forests, and strive to reclaim all the existing 20 million mu of Camellia oleifera forests in the country within two to three years. In this way, four to five years later, tea oil production can be increased from 960,000 dan in 1954 to 4 million to 5 million dan, which will play a significant role in solving the national shortage of edible oil.

The notice pointed out: Local people say "Digging gold in July, digging silver in August." July and August are the best seasons for reclaiming and nurturing Camellia oleifera forests. All Camellia oleifera producing areas should seize the time to do the following tasks well: First, strengthen the leadership of the reclamation and nurturing of Camellia oleifera forests. Formulate practical and feasible reclamation and nurturing plans. Forestry departments must deploy and organize forces to go deep into key counties and districts to strengthen specific leadership, summarize technical experience among the masses, and promote it. Second, Camellia oleifera production itself has the characteristics of being labor-intensive, capital-intensive, and having late returns. Therefore, the reclamation of Camellia oleifera forests should first rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In the work, the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit should be earnestly implemented. Attention should be paid to correcting the tendency of Camellia oleifera owners or laborers suffering losses in some mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For Camellia oleifera that has not joined the cooperative, it can be managed by the Camellia oleifera owner at his own discretion, or the Camellia oleifera can remain privately owned, and the cooperative can uniformly organize labor for reclamation and nurturing, and determine an appropriate profit sharing ratio based on the quality of Camellia oleifera production and the amount of labor involved. In areas where the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations is weak, methods such as hiring labor, contracting, or temporarily not paying remuneration and sharing profits proportionally when there are returns can be adopted according to the actual needs of local tea farmers. State banks should focus on issuing loans to help farmers overcome the difficulties of reclaiming Camellia oleifera forests. Third, in accordance with the national policy of vigorously developing oil crops production, deeply publicize the forestry policy of "whoever plants it owns it" and the policy of unified purchase and sale of tea oil to eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses. Fourth, strengthen technical guidance. Educate farmers to pay attention to soil and water conservation when reclaiming mountains. For Camellia oleifera hills with small slopes, full reclamation can be carried out; for large slopes, hole reclamation or strip reclamation should be adopted; for steep mountains, reclamation should not be carried out to prevent water from scouring. In areas with abundant labor, the masses should be guided to prune branches; for old Camellia oleifera forests that have lost their management value, rejuvenation through germination should be implemented; and diseased plants with serious diseases must be cut down and burned to prevent the spread of germs.

### 林业部通知各地垦复油茶林

　  林业部通知各地垦复油茶林
    林业部于六月下旬发出“关于抓紧季节大力领导、组织群众垦复、抚育油茶林的通知”。通知说：几年来，我国茶油产量已有很大提高，但仍未达到战前最高生产水平。全国油茶林约有半数荒芜，已垦复的油茶林抚育也很差，每亩平均产量很低。因此，积极地发动、组织广大农民进行油茶林的垦复和抚育工作，争取在二、三年内将全国现有二千万亩油茶林全部垦复。这样，四、五年后，茶油产量即可由一九五四年的九十六万市担提高到四百至五百万市担，这对于解决全国食油不足问题是有重大作用的。
    通知指出：当地群众有“七月挖金，八月挖银”之说，七、八两月正是垦复和抚育油茶林的最好季节，各个油茶产区应抓紧时间，做好以下几项工作：第一、加强对油茶林垦复和抚育的领导。制定切实可行的垦复抚育计划。林业部门必须调配、组织力量，深入重点县、区，加强具体领导，总结群众中的技术经验，加以推广。第二、油茶生产本身具有费工多，投资大，收益迟的特点，因此，油茶林垦复工作应首先依靠互助合作组织来进行。工作中应切实贯彻自愿互利政策，对有些互助合作组织中存在的油茶主或劳力方面吃亏等偏向，应注意加以纠正。对未入社的油茶，可根据油茶主的自愿，由他自己经营，或采用油茶仍归私有，由社统一组织劳动进行垦复、抚育，按照油茶生产好坏和费工多少，确定适当的分益比例。在互助合作组织发展薄弱的地区，还可根据当地油农生产的实际需要，采取雇工、大包干或暂不给报酬、有收益时按比例分成等办法，进行垦复。国家银行要有重点地发放贷款，帮助农民克服垦复油茶林的困难。第三、根据国家大力发展油料作物生产的方针，深入地宣传“谁种谁有”的林业政策和茶油统购统销政策，解除群众的思想顾虑。第四、加强技术指导。教育农民垦山中注意水土保持，油茶山坡度小的可进行全垦，坡度大的应采取穴垦或带状垦，山势较陡的不开垦，以防水大冲刷。在劳力充裕的地区，要指导群众整枝；对于已失去经营价值的老油茶林，应实行萌芽更新；对病害严重的病株，必须砍掉焚毁，以防止病菌蔓延。
