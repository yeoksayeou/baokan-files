Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 26th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a letter to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam on the 25th, protesting the recent actions in South Vietnam that violate the Geneva Accords, particularly the brutal behavior of the Ngo Dinh Diem group towards some representatives of the International Commission during a demonstration in Saigon on July 20th.

Vo Nguyen Giap listed the facts, pointing out that the atrocities in Saigon were organized and prepared actions under the protection of the South Vietnamese authorities. Their purpose was to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, oppose the presence of the International Commission and the liaison officers of the Vietnamese People's Army in the South, in order to realize the conspiracy to obstruct the consultative conference, undermine peace and the unification of Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the actions of the South Vietnamese authorities seriously violated Articles 14A, 25 and 27 of the Geneva Accords and ran counter to the Vietnamese people's desire for peace and unification, as well as the world people's desire for peace. The Commander-in-Chief of the French Federal Forces in Indochina and the South Vietnamese authorities must be held responsible for the events that have occurred.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army strongly protests the above-mentioned destructive actions and agrees with some of the necessary measures taken by the International Commission to deal with the July 20th incident. It recommends that the International Commission continue to take necessary measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and fully implemented.

Vo Nguyen Giap concluded by saying that this is a very important issue, which is not only related to the consolidation of peace in Vietnam, but also to the peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    武元甲抗议南越当局制造西贡暴行事件
    新华社河内二十六日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在二十五日送了一封信给越南国际监督和监察委员会，抗议最近在越南南方发生的违反日内瓦协定的行动，特别是七月二十日吴庭艳集团在西贡制造的一次示威中对国际委员会的一些代表的粗暴行为。
    武元甲列举事实，指出在西贡发生的暴行是在越南南方当局庇护下有组织、有准备的行动，其目的在于破坏日内瓦协定的履行，反对国际委员会和越南人民军联络官驻在南方，借以实现阻挠协商会议、破坏和平和越南统一的阴谋。
    武元甲指出：越南南方当局的行动严重违反了日内瓦协定第十四条甲款、第二十五条和第二十七条的规定，并且是同越南人民要求和平和统一的愿望以及世界人民要求和平的愿望背道而驰的。印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部和越南南方当局对已发生的事件必须负责。
    武元甲说，越南人民军总司令部强烈抗议上述破坏行动，并且同意国际委员会为处理七月二十日的事件而采取的一些必要的措施。它建议国际委员会继续采取必要的措施来保证日内瓦协定得到尊重和充分执行。
    武元甲最后说，这是一个非常重要的问题，它不但关系到越南和平的巩固，而且也关系到东南亚和世界的和平。
