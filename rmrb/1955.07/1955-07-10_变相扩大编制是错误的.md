    Disguised Expansion of Staffing is Wrong
    To the Editor:
    The Commercial Section of the Luoyang Prefectural Office in Henan Province frequently transfers staff from state-owned enterprises to assist with their work for extended periods. The staffing and salaries of these personnel are still counted within the state-owned enterprises. Their reasoning is: the Commercial Section has a small staff, is overwhelmed with work, and higher authorities won't approve an increase in personnel. As a result, four or five staff members from enterprise departments have consistently been transferred to the Commercial Section to assist with its work. Shangguan Jie was transferred to the Luoyang branch of the China Oil and Fat Company in January 1955, but he has not worked a single day in his official capacity, having been directly transferred to the Prefectural Office's Commercial Section to assist with work. However, his salary is still paid by the Luoyang branch. Not long ago, the Commercial Section issued a notice to the branch, requesting funds for one person's salary and office expenses, without specifying who it was or where they worked, simply stating that they were responsible for a certain amount of supply expenses each month, for which the Prefectural Office's Commercial Section would provide a receipt, which could then be used for reimbursement.
    I believe this practice is wrong. Since the number of staff in the Commercial Section is fixed, why should they be privately increased? Our state-owned enterprises have all implemented economic accounting systems, and now the Commercial Section is asking our company to pay for one person's salary and benefits. Isn't this an expansion of staffing, violating the economic accounting system? This erroneous practice of superiors exploiting subordinates and disguising the expansion of staffing is absolutely unacceptable. The Luoyang Prefectural Office must immediately rectify this erroneous practice of the Commercial Section.

### 变相扩大编制是错误的

    变相扩大编制是错误的编辑同志：
    河南省洛阳专署商业科经常抽调国营企业部门的工作人员长期协助工作，这些人员的编制及工资仍然算在国营企业里。他们这样做的理由是：商业科编制人员少，工作忙不过来，如果增添人员的话，上级又不批准。因此一直就有四、五个企业部门的工作人员被调在商业科工作。上官杰从一九五五年一月份调到中国油脂公司洛阳支公司来以后就没有到职工作一天，就直接被抽调到专署商业科协助工作去了，但薪金仍由洛阳支公司付给。不久以前，商业科又给支公司下了一个通知，叫供给一个人的薪金和办公费，也不说是谁，在那里工作，只是说每月负责多少元的供给费，由专署商业科给打一张单据，然后凭单据报销即可。
    我认为这样的作法是错误的。既然商业科的工作人员规定了一定的名额，为什么又要私自增加呢？我们的国营企业都已实行了经济核算制，现在商业科又叫我们公司替他开支一人的工薪，这不是扩大了编制，违反了经济核算制吗？这种上级卡下级，变相扩大编制的错误做法是绝对不能容许的。洛阳专署要立即纠正商业科的这种错误作法。
