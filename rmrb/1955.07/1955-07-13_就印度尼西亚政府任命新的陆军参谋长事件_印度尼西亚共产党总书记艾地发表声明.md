Ai Di said: "In the current situation where there are attempts to forcibly establish a military dictatorship and some are trying to forcibly establish a presidential cabinet that violates the constitution, the Indonesian Communist Party's attitude is to absolutely support the government's defense of parliamentary democracy, which is to say, the defense of the provisional constitution."
