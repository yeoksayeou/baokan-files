Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: The Vietnam Women's Union held a national women's conference in Hanoi on the evening of the 10th, demanding a consultative conference to prepare for the realization of national unification through general elections.

More than 10,000 representatives from women's organizations in various inter-zones and provinces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, representatives of women from South Vietnam, and representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi attended the conference.

Le Thi Xuyen, Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union, delivered a report in which she pointed out that the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demanding consultation with the relevant authorities in South Vietnam on general elections fully meets the vital requirements of Vietnamese women. Only with the peaceful unification of the country can the happiness of families and children be guaranteed. Therefore, all mothers and women in Vietnam are determined to strive for the peace and unification of the country.

Le Thi Xuyen pointed out that U.S. imperialism is plotting to sabotage the general elections and unification of Vietnam. She called on women across the country to actively struggle for the realization of consultation and general elections.

Nguyen An Ninh, a representative of mothers from South Vietnam, spoke at the conference. She stated that the people and women of South Vietnam, who have persisted in the war of resistance, resolutely demand national unification. Other speakers also expressed their will to hold consultations and general elections.

The conference finally adopted a resolution supporting the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on preparing to hold a consultative conference with the responsible authorities in South Vietnam. The conference also adopted a letter to the World Mothers' Congress and letters to the women of South Vietnam and the women of France.

Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: According to TASS, Paris, July 11th: The French Committee for a Peaceful Settlement of the Vietnam War has written to French Prime Minister Faure, demanding that the government faithfully abide by the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The letter emphasizes that the general elections in Vietnam, scheduled for July of next year, should guarantee the independence, unification, and territorial integrity of the country. The letter states: "However, some people are attempting to delay this election under the pretext of the current situation in South Vietnam and the Saigon government's non-recognition of the Geneva Accords, and delaying the election is contrary to the task of restoring Vietnam's unification and the unanimous aspirations of the Vietnamese people. Delaying the election will affect the implementation of the Geneva Accords, as well as the possibility of establishing friendly relations between France and Vietnam in the cultural, economic, and political fields, thereby potentially undermining peace in Vietnam and causing serious consequences for France, Vietnam, and the world."

The letter was signed by figures from various sectors of French political, social, trade union, and religious circles, as well as writers and scientists.

    法国人民要求法政府确切地遵守日内瓦协定
    新华社河内十一日电　越南妇女联合会十日晚在河内召开了全国妇女大会，要求举行协商会议准备通过普选来实现全国的统一。
    参加大会的有越南民主共和国各联区、各省妇女代表、越南南方妇女代表以及河内各界代表共一万多人。
    越南妇女联合会主席黎氏钏作了报告，她指出，越南民主共和国政府要求越南南方有关当局协商普选的声明，完全符合越南妇女的切身要求，只有国家和平统一，家庭和儿童的幸福才能得到保障。因此，全越南的母亲们、妇女们都坚决争取国家的和平和统一。
    黎氏钏指出，美帝国主义正在阴谋破坏越南的普选和统一。她号召全国妇女积极斗争，争取实现协商和普选。
    越南南方的母亲代表阮安宁在大会上讲话。她表示，坚持抗战的越南南方的人民和妇女坚决要求国家统一。其他发言者也都表示了要求举行协商、普选的意志。
    大会最后通过决议，支持越南民主共和国政府关于准备同越南南方负责当局举行协商会议的声明。大会并且通过了给世界母亲大会的信和给越南南方妇女、法国妇女的信。
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：法国争取和平解决越南战争委员会写信给法国政府总理富尔，要求政府确切地遵守关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协定。
    这封信着重指出：预定在明年七月举行的越南普选应当保证这个国家的独立、统一和领土完整。这封信说：“但是，有人正在借口越南南方目前的局势和西贡政府不承认日内瓦协定，企图拖延这次选举，而拖延选举是同恢复越南统一的任务、同越南人民的一致愿望牴触的。拖延选举就会影响日内瓦协定的实施，也会影响法国和越南之间在文化、经济和政治方面建立友好联系的可能性，从而可能破坏越南的和平，给法国、越南和全世界造成严重的后果。”
    在信上签名的有法国政治、社会、工会和宗教各界人士以及作家和科学家。
