    To the Mothers of All Nations Gathering in Lausanne
    —A Mother of Four Blesses the World Mothers' Congress from Her Hospital Bed
    Chen Guangyu
    I am now lying in the recovery room of the Obstetrics Department of the Beijing Municipal Fifth Hospital. The air here is serene: white gowns, white sheets, white walls... The nurse comrades are hurrying back and forth in the corridor with light steps, carrying medicine trays... Looking out from the large glass window, the breeze is swaying the willow branches outside, and the cicadas' chirps break the silence... Not far from here is the nursery. The babies have just been fed, and now there is not a single cry to be heard; perhaps they are all asleep!

    I cannot help but smile slightly. Five days ago, my fourth child was born. Seeing the child's pink face, dark and shiny hair, chubby little hands... the hardship of pregnancy and the fatigue of childbirth are all forgotten. I look again at my companions in the neighboring beds. Some are becoming mothers for the first time, and some are already mothers of several children, but they all, like me, have joyful smiles on their faces from time to time.

    Peace, creation, life... this is the greatest happiness of mankind!

    My thoughts stretch far away. I think of our mothers' generation; they have walked a difficult road.

    In our country, there is a very popular song that begins like this:

    The old society, it was like,
    A bottomless, dark, and gloomy well,
    With us common people trapped at the bottom,
    And women at the very bottom.

    Yes, in the past, Chinese women lived in a dark well with no sunlight. In those days, being born a woman was the greatest misfortune. Parents called girls "money-losing goods" and even drowned them in chamber pots immediately after birth; in those days, women were bought and sold like commodities, without even their own names; in those days, how many unmarried girls were married to memorial tablets, how many young women lived as widows while their husbands were still alive; in those days, how much did women want a child, yet how afraid they were to have a child, because giving birth to a child meant increasing the burden; in those days, how many disasters, famines, and diseases stood in the way of life, causing mothers anxiety and sorrow...

    In 1949, the Chinese people's revolution triumphed throughout the country. Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared to the world: "The Chinese people have stood up!" Our women have also been liberated and are living better and better lives.

    "Women of the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. Marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state." Such articles are brilliantly written into our Constitution. All professional doors are open to women: the first female tractor driver, the first female train driver, the first group of female pilots... such "firsts" or "first groups" can often be seen in the newspapers; female factory directors and female ministers... are also becoming more and more common. I am a middle school teacher. In the old society, I often worried that having too many children would lead to dismissal. Now, my profession has a reliable guarantee. I can get fifty-six days of leave for childbirth and still receive my salary. My hospitalization costs nothing, because I enjoy the state's free medical care... As for the child, from the moment she is born, she is under the care and affection of the state. In the future, she can enter nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools... her aspirations and ideals will be taken care of, her personality can develop in a healthy way, and she can become a useful person to the country and the people.

    We have no doubt that our labor, our strength, and our wisdom are for ourselves and for our descendants, for a happy today and for a better future.

    However, we also clearly know that in this world, there is still a small handful of people who want the people to bleed and themselves to get rich, who are creating war hysteria and preparing for a new world war. In order to increase their company stocks and bank deposits, they are busily planning to drive tens of thousands of people to become cannon fodder, planning to take away our husbands and children. On a newspaper on my bedside table from a few days ago, there was a news item saying that the American authorities held a large-scale so-called "hydrogen bomb attack" drill from June 15th to 17th in more than fifty cities, including Washington and New York. The Associated Press described it as the "largest ever" drill, a "ruthless" "rehearsal."

    Who exactly wants to carry out an "atomic attack" on the United States? Our peaceful and democratic country has always advocated the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and universal disarmament. We want peace, we want construction, we want our children to sleep peacefully in their cradles, we want the flowers and trees in the parks to grow lushly... We have never wanted to threaten anyone, nor have we ever threatened anyone. The gentlemen in Washington are enthusiastic about atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and it is they who plan to turn the "rehearsal" into a real "performance," to turn the "cold war" into a "hot war."

    My second daughter, Beibei, heard that some people wanted to provoke war and asked me strangely: Are those people covered in green fur, with bloody mouths, two long fangs sticking out, and two claws always trying to prey on small creatures, like the monsters in the movies?

    We have no right to laugh at this idea of a six-year-old child. In her small mind, she also believes that "human" is a noble name. Those guys who want to use war to slaughter people cannot be called "human," they are just a group of beasts in human skin.

    My eldest son, Ganggang, is already a second-grade student in elementary school, and he understands more than his younger sister. He said: "If they are beasts, we will tie them up with iron chains and not let them come out to eat people!"

    This is our children's sacred hope for us!

    We—the mothers of mankind—need peace and do not allow war. We are absolutely unwilling for our children to tear each other apart on the battlefield. Mothers who conceive life want to protect life.

    Mothers all over the world cannot forget the deaths of fifty million people in World War II, including their own husbands and sons; cannot forget the horrific massacres and tortures in the concentration camps of Lidice, Buchenwald, and Auschwitz; cannot forget the suffering of the Korean and Vietnamese people who suffered the hardships of war not long ago; cannot forget the atomic disasters of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They see the increasingly heavy war budgets and war economies, which have plunged millions of families in Western countries into poverty and unemployment, and have brought unbearable pain to millions of women and mothers. Therefore, the urgent desire and responsibility of mothers all over the world is to take immediate action to stop war, maintain peace, strengthen friendship between people, and protect the lives, safety, and happiness of children.

    When I learned from the radio broadcast that the World Mothers' Congress had opened in Lausanne, Switzerland, I could not restrain my inner joy and excitement. You—the outstanding representatives of hundreds of millions of mothers all over the world—with the noble dignity of motherhood, with the great feelings and sense of responsibility for your children, have gathered in Lausanne to discuss the common issues of greatest concern to all mothers in the world. In the name of an ordinary Chinese woman, in the name of a mother of four children, I bless you and am determined to fight for the implementation of the Congress's resolutions. I am an ordinary mother, and my strength is very small; but I believe that if millions of mothers all over the world take action, they will hold down the black hand that attempts to ignite the flames of aggression.

    As I write this, the young nurse is pushing the baby carriage again. It is time to breastfeed the child. I take my yet-to-be-named child from the nurse's hand. She opens her bright little eyes and looks at me. In order to make her only know the fragrance of flowers and not understand the smell of gunpowder; only know the happiness of life and not understand the disasters of war; I am willing to pay any price and dedicate all my strength.

    寄汇集洛桑的各国母亲们
    ——一个四个孩子的母亲在产床上对世界母亲大会的祝福
    陈光玉
    我现在正躺在北京市立第五医院产科休养室的床上，这儿的空气是宁静的：白色的罩衫，白色的床单，白色的墙壁，……护士同志正端着药盘在走廊里轻手轻脚地匆匆来去，……从宽大的玻璃窗里望出去，外面，轻风正摇动着柳条，声声的蝉鸣划破了寂静，……离这儿不远就是婴儿室，刚才喂过了奶，现在听不到一声啼哭，也许都已睡熟了吧！
    我禁不住微微地笑了。五天以前，我的第四个孩子降生了。看到孩子粉红色的脸蛋，黑油油的头发，胖胖的小手，……孕育的辛苦，分娩的疲劳，都一齐忘掉了。我再望望邻床的同伴们，有的还是头一次当母亲，有的已是几个孩子的母亲了，但她们都和我一样，脸上不时露出愉悦的笑容。
    和平，创造，生命……这是人类最大的幸福！
    我的思想伸展得很远，我想到了我们的母亲一代，她们走过了一段艰难的道路。
    在我们国家里，有一首很流行的歌曲，一开头就这样唱道：
    旧社会，好比是，
    黑古隆冬的枯井万丈深，
    井底下压着咱们老百姓，
    妇女在最底层。
    是的，从前中国妇女是在不见天日的枯井中生活的啊。在那个时候，生为一个妇女，就是最大的不幸，父母把女孩子叫做“赔钱货”，甚至一生下来就扔在尿桶里溺死了；在那个时候，妇女像货物一样被买来卖去，连个自己的名字都没有；在那个时候，多少没有过门的女孩子同牌位成亲，多少年纪青青的妇女守活寡；在那个时候，妇女们想要一个孩子，又多么怕有一个孩子，因为生下一个孩子，就意味着增加一份负担；在那个时候，有多少灾难、饥饿和疾病横在生活的道路上，引起母亲们的焦虑和忧愁……
    一九四九年，中国人民的革命在全国范围胜利了，毛泽东同志向全世界庄严地宣告：“中国人从此站立起来了”；我国妇女也从此翻了身，日子越过越美。
    “中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利。婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。”这样的条文，辉煌地写在我们的宪法上。所有职业的大门为妇女而打开：第一个女拖拉机手，第一个女火车司机，第一批女飞行员，……经常可以从报纸上看到这样的“第一个”或“第一批”；女厂长、女部长……也是愈来愈平常了。我是一个中学教师，在旧社会里，常常担心孩子多了被解聘，现在我的职业有了可靠的保障；我生小孩可以得到五十六天的休假，仍然照领工资；我住医院不化一文钱，因为我享受着国家的公费医疗待遇。……至于孩子，她一生下来就在国家的关怀和爱抚之下，她将来可以进托儿所、幼儿园、小学、中学……她的志愿和理想会得到照顾，她的个性能够有健全的发展，她可以成为对国家、对人民有用的人。
    我们毫不怀疑，我们的劳动，我们的力量和智慧，是为了我们自己也为了我们的后代，为了幸福的今天也为了更美好的未来。
    但是，我们也清楚地知道，在这个世界上，也还有想叫人民流血、自己发财的那么一小撮人，正在制造战争的歇斯底里，准备新的世界战争。他们为了增多他们的公司股票和银行存款，正在紧张地筹划着驱使成千上万的人去当炮灰，筹划着要夺去我们的丈夫和儿女。在我床头的一张前些日子的报纸上，就有这么一条消息，说美国当局从六月十五日到十七日，在包括华盛顿和纽约在内的五十几座城市内，举行了一次大规模的所谓“氢弹攻击”演习。合众社把它形容为“有史以来规模最大”的一次演习，“一次冷酷无情的”“彩排”。
    究竟是谁要对美国进行“原子攻击”呢？我们和平民主的国家是一直主张无条件禁止使用原子武器和普遍裁减军备的。我们要和平，我们要建设，我们要孩子们安静地睡在摇篮里，我们要公园里的花木成长茂盛，……我们从来不想威胁谁，也从来没有威胁过任何人。华盛顿的老爷们才热衷于原子弹和氢弹，正是他们打算把“彩排”变成真正的“演出”，把“冷战”变成“热战”。
    我的二女儿蓓蓓，听说有人要挑动战争，很奇怪地问我：那些人是不是周身长着绿毛，张着血嘴，突出两根长牙，两只爪子老想捕食小生物，像电影里的恶兽一样？
    对于六岁孩子的这个想法，我们是没有权利发笑的。在她小小的心目中，也认为“人”是一个崇高的名字。那些想用战争来屠杀人的家伙，实在不能称为“人”，它们只是一群披着人皮的野兽。
    我的大儿子钢钢，已经是小学二年级的学生了，他比妹妹懂得多些。他说：“如果是野兽，我们就用铁链子把它们拴起来，不能让它们出来随便吃人！”
    这就是我们的孩子对我们的神圣希望！
    我们——人类的母亲需要和平，不容许有战争。我们决不愿意我们的孩子在战场上互相撕杀。孕育生命的母亲要保卫生命。
    全世界的母亲们都不能忘记第二次世界大战中五千万人的死亡，这里面有她们自己的丈夫和儿子；不能忘记利台斯、柏德奈克和奥斯威辛集中营的惨绝人寰的屠杀和折磨；不能忘记不久以前朝鲜和越南人民遭受过的战争的苦难；不能忘记广岛和长崎的原子灾祸。她们看到越来越沉重的战争预算和战争经济，使西方各国千千万万的家庭陷于贫困和失业的状态之中，给千千万万的妇女和母亲带来了难以忍受的苦痛。因此，全世界的母亲们的迫切愿望和责任，就是立刻行动起来，制止战争，维护和平，加强人民之间的友谊，保卫孩子的生命、安全和幸福。
    当我从无线电广播里知道了世界母亲大会在瑞士洛桑开幕的消息，我抑制不住自己内心的喜悦和激动。你们——全世界亿万母亲的卓越的代表，以崇高的母性的尊严，对子女伟大的感情和责任感，齐集洛桑商讨全世界所有的母亲所最关切的共同问题。我以一个中国普通妇女的名义，以一个四个孩子的母亲的名义，向你们祝福，并决心为实现大会的决议而斗争。我是一个普通的母亲，我的力量是很小的；但是我相信，倘若全世界千千万万的母亲都行动起来，就会按住那只企图燃起侵略战火的黑手。
    写到这里，年轻的护士又推着婴儿车来了，这正是给孩子哺乳的时候，我从护士的手里接过我的尚未命名的孩子，她睁开明亮的小眼望着我。为了使她只知道花朵的芬香，不懂得硝烟的气味；只知道人生的幸福，不懂得战争的灾难；我甘愿付出任何代价，献出我的一切力量。
