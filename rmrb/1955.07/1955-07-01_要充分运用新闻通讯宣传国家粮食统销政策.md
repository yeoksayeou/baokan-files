　　To fully utilize news communications to publicize the National Grain Unified Sales Policy
　　Tie Yi
    In addition to making necessary explanations, newspaper publicity on the Party and state's grain unified sales policy should also use rich and powerful factual materials to illustrate the correctness and necessity of this policy, reflect how this policy is being accepted by the vast number of cadres and the masses, and report on the situation and experience in implementing the policy, in order to enhance the understanding of the policy among cadres and the masses and promote the development of practical work. In this way, in addition to publishing necessary commentaries and articles, newspapers should make full use of a large number of news reports and communications to vividly reflect the specific situation of the implementation of the grain unified sales policy in the local area, so that news and communications can play a significant role in policy publicity. The Guangxi Daily is doing a relatively good job in this regard.
    In its publicity on the rectification of grain unified sales work, the Guangxi Daily has published a large number of news reports and communications, in addition to publishing commentaries and articles explaining the policy content, comprehensively reporting on the progress of this work in the local area. Taking May as an example, reports on the rectification of grain unified sales work appeared almost daily on the newspaper pages, with a total of fifty-five reports on this aspect published throughout the month. In these reports, the Guangxi Daily has strived to use vivid facts to confirm the complete correctness of this national policy. In a communication entitled "'Grain Shortage' Stories," the newspaper used the story of a surplus grain farmer fraudulently purchasing grain to explain the reason for the grain shortage. This farmer, who had not sold enough surplus grain during the unified purchase, could not sleep well at night because he was afraid of people borrowing grain from him and afraid that the government would continue to buy his surplus grain. He repeatedly inquired whether other farmers with surplus grain had reported grain shortages. When he learned that a farmer in his village with surplus grain had reported a grain shortage, and the township had issued a grain purchase certificate to this person without investigation, he also went to fraudulently report a grain shortage and bought back three hundred catties of grain. The newspaper used this fact to powerfully illustrate that the farmers' lack of understanding of the grain policy was the main reason for the surplus grain farmers' fraudulent reporting of grain shortages and fraudulent grain purchases; it also illustrated that it is very necessary to rectify the grain unified sales work and further publicize the national grain policy to the farmers through this work. In another communication on the situation of the rectification of grain unified sales work in Liulian Township, Wuming County, the newspaper used facts to prove to the masses that the purpose of compressing unreasonable supplies is to ensure reasonable supplies. This township has only four hundred and eight households, but even after the government issued four hundred and fifteen grain purchase certificates, some people still said they were short of grain, and there were indeed a very few households short of grain. After in-depth investigation and research, it was found that most of the people who shouted the loudest about grain shortage and bought the most grain were some people with surplus grain, while a few people who were truly short of grain did not buy grain. After rectification, the actual grain sales were less than one-third of the amount originally requested by the masses, but it enabled all the people short of grain to buy grain. This shows that the current tense grain unified sales situation is not because the state is selling less grain, but because a large amount of grain has been bought by people who are not short of grain. The current rectification of grain unified sales work is precisely to change this abnormal and unreasonable phenomenon. Being good at selecting facts with typical significance for publicity in news communications can deepen the understanding of the policy spirit among cadres and the masses, eliminate their various ideological concerns, and enhance their confidence in implementing the policy.
    In order to help cadres correctly and effectively implement the national grain policy, the Guangxi Daily has widely disseminated good work experience from various places through news and communications. The newspaper has successively introduced the experience of Liangjiang Township in Wuming County, which mobilized from within the Party to outside the Party, from backbone elements to the masses, and contracted tasks by area to do a good job in rectifying grain unified sales and production work; introduced the experience of Leilong Township in Fusui County, which mobilized the masses to do a good job in rectifying grain unified sales work by having Party member backbones take the lead in inspections and agricultural production cooperatives drive mutual aid groups; introduced how Zichong Township in Lingshan County deeply investigated the masses to calculate the three accounts of grain production, purchase, and sales to carry out the rectification of grain unified sales work; introduced the experience of some counties in holding branch general meetings of Party members to clarify various erroneous understandings in the grain unified sales work, as well as the experience of village and township staff in conducting individual publicity to the masses, and so on. If policy explanations can make the vast number of cadres aware of the importance of mobilizing the masses, the importance of relying on the leadership of the Party branch and giving play to the exemplary role of Party members, and the importance of eliminating the ideological concerns of grassroots backbone elements and cadres setting an example; then, this kind of experience introduction can not only make cadres recognize the importance of these issues from the point of view of reason, but also learn the methods of doing this work well from vivid examples. The characteristic of the Guangxi Daily in reporting these work experiences is that it does not seek completeness in every article, nor does it write long and tedious articles, but rather is concise, specific, and highlights the key points. This is both timely and widespread; both suitable for the current urgent requirements of work and in line with the actual development of work.
    The Guangxi Daily has carried out some vivid and engaging publicity in this regard. For example, two pieces of self-narration by a director of an agricultural production cooperative who withdrew grain that should not have been purchased and a head of a district who withdrew a grain purchase certificate, published on May 12, and a communication entitled "The Transformation of Branch Secretary Meng Shucun," published on May 14, not only reflected the fact that these people corrected their past mistakes and actively and happily carried out the rectification of grain unified sales work, but also reflected the fact that these people, as Communist Party members, were growing in their sense of responsibility and were striving to overcome the various aspects of their own selfish and self-interested thinking. Similarly, when reporting on the activities of the peasant masses, the newspaper not only reflected their actual actions in supporting the national policy, but also paid attention to publicizing the growth of their socialist consciousness. For example, a communication entitled "This Time We Can Produce with Peace of Mind," in reporting on a member of an agricultural production cooperative who understood the issue and withdrew the grain purchase certificate and the excess grain purchased, quoted the member's own words to explain his understanding of the issue: "... Those who are not short of grain or are slightly short of grain have purchased grain and purchased excess grain, and the real grain-short households like Zhong Qingzhen are affected. How can we jointly take the socialist road?" Another report also quoted a farmer who had falsely reported a grain shortage as saying: "Our grain sales are for the 'three major supports.' If everyone is like me, reporting a shortage even when not short, wouldn't we be blocking the socialist road?" These words can move the vast number of peasants who are eager to take the socialist road but are temporarily blinded by the false phenomenon of artificially created grain shortages. In addition, the newspaper also paid attention to exposing the activities of bad elements who disrupt the grain unified sales work in order to educate peasants to raise their political vigilance.
    In the process of reporting on the implementation of the Party and state's policies, the Party's newspapers should also focus on reflecting the role of Party organizations and Party members. The Guangxi Daily paid attention to this point in its reports on the rectification of grain unified sales work. For example, in the newspaper's report on the rectification of grain unified sales work in counties directly under the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, it was reported that 90% of the Party members in the Fourth and Ninth Districts of Heng County played an active leading role in the work. The masses reflected that Communist Party members can indeed be selfless. In addition to reflecting the activities of Party organizations and Party members in general reports, the newspaper also focused on reporting the leadership and core role of rural Party organizations and Party members in this work in the Party Life column. The Party Life column on May 14 reported on the example of Party member Dan Zhouzong setting an example in doing a good job in rectifying grain unified sales work; the Party Life column on May 18 also reported that the Third District of Laibin County convened a general meeting of Party members to solve problems in the grain unified sales work.
    These reports from the Guangxi Daily once again prove how significant a role politically oriented, combative, and multifaceted news communications play in publicizing the Party's great thought and policies.

### 要充分运用新闻通讯宣传国家粮食统销政策

　　要充分运用新闻通讯宣传国家粮食统销政策
　　铁衣
    报纸对党和国家粮食统销政策的宣传，除了作必要的解释以外，还应该运用丰富有力的事实材料来说明这一政策的正确性和必要性，反映这一政策如何为广大干部和群众所接受，报道贯彻政策中的情况和经验，以提高干部和群众对政策的认识，推动实际工作的开展。这样，报纸除了发表必要的评论、文章外，就要充分运用大量的新闻和通讯，把当地贯彻粮食统销政策的具体情况生动地反映到报纸上来，使得新闻、通讯在政策宣传中发挥重大的作用。广西日报在这方面是做得比较好的。
    广西日报对整顿粮食统销工作的宣传，除发表阐释政策内容的评论、文章外，还发表了大量的新闻通讯，全面地报道了这一工作在当地开展的情况。以五月份为例，整顿粮食统销工作的报道，几乎天天不离报纸版面，全月共发表关于这一方面的报道五十五篇。广西日报在这些报道中，努力用生动的事实来证实国家这一政策的完全正确。报纸在一篇“‘缺粮’的故事”的通讯里，用一个余粮户农民冒购粮食的经过，说明了粮食紧张的原因。这个在统购中并没有卖足余粮的农民，因怕人向他借粮，又怕政府继续购买他的余粮，晚上连觉都睡不好。他再三打听其他有余粮的农民是否报了缺粮，当他知道本屯一个有余粮的农民报了缺粮，乡上没有调查就发给这个人购粮证后，也就去冒报缺粮，买回了三百斤粮食。报纸用这个事实有力地说明了，农民不了解粮食政策是引起有余粮的农民冒报缺粮冒购粮食的主要原因；也说明了对粮食统销工作进行整顿，并通过这个工作向农民群众进一步宣传国家的粮食政策是非常必要的。报纸在另一篇关于武鸣县六联乡整顿粮食统销工作情况的通讯中，又用事实向群众证明压缩不合理的供应的目的就是为了保证合理的供应。这个乡只有四百零八户人家，但在政府发了四百一十五张购粮证以后，仍然有人说缺粮，而且也真的还有极个别的缺粮户。经过深入的调查研究，发现原来喊缺粮最凶和买粮最多的人，大都是一些有余粮的人，而个别真正缺粮的人反倒没有买上粮食。经过整顿，实际销粮还不到原来群众要求量的三分之一，但却使所有缺粮的人都买到了粮食。这就说明目前粮食统销情况所以紧张，并不是因为国家销售的粮食少，而是因为大量的粮食被并不缺粮的人买去了，现在进行整顿粮食统销工作，正是为了改变这种不正常不合理的现象。在新闻通讯中善于选择有典型意义的事实来进行宣传，都能加深干部和群众对政策精神的理解，消除他们的各种思想顾虑，增强他们贯彻政策的信心。
    为了帮助干部正确有效地贯彻国家粮食政策，广西日报运用新闻和通讯广泛地传播了各地好的工作经验。报纸先后介绍过武鸣县两江乡由党内到党外，由骨干到群众，层层发动，按片包干做好整顿粮食统销和生产工作的经验；介绍过扶绥县蕾陇乡由党员骨干带头检查，由农业生产合作社带动互助组，发动群众做好整顿粮食统销工作的经验；介绍过灵山县梓崇乡如何深入群众算好粮食产、购、销三笔账以开展整顿粮食统销工作的经验；介绍过一些县开好支部党员大会澄清对粮食统销工作中的各种错误认识的经验，以及乡村工作人员怎样向群众进行个别宣传的经验等等。如果说政策讲解可以使广大干部认识到发动群众的重要，认识到依靠党的支部的领导和发挥党员模范作用的重要，认识到消除基层骨干分子思想顾虑和干部以身作则的重要；那么，这种经验介绍就不只是可以使干部们从道理上认识这些问题的重要，而且可以从活生生的事例中学得做好这一工作的方法。广西日报报道这些工作经验的特点，是并不篇篇求全，也不是长篇大论，而是简明、具体、突出，有哪一点就介绍哪一点。这样既可及时，又可广泛；既适合于当前工作的迫切要求，又符合实际工作发展的状况。
    广西日报在这方面曾进行了一些生动引人的宣传。例如五月十二日发表的一个农业生产合作社社长退出不应购的粮食和一个片长退出购粮证的两篇当事人的自述，五月十四日发表的“支部书记蒙树村的转变”的通讯，就都是不只反映了这些人纠正了自己过去的错误行为，积极愉快地去进行整顿粮食统销工作的情况，而且反映了这些人作为共产党员，他们的责任感正在增长，他们正在努力克服着本身自私自利思想的种种情况。同样地，报纸在报道农民群众的活动时，除了反映他们拥护国家政策的实际行动以外，也注意宣扬他们社会主义意识的增长。例如一篇题为“这回我们可安心生产了”的通讯，在报道一个农业生产合作社社员弄通思想，退出了购粮证和多购的粮食时，就引用了这个社员自己的话来说明他对这个问题的认识：“……不缺粮和少缺粮的都购了粮和多购了粮，像锺庆珍这样的真正缺粮户反而受到影响，这怎么能够共同走社会主义道路呢？”另一篇报道也引用了一个曾经冒报缺粮的农民说过的话：“我们卖粮就是为了‘三大支援’，如果人人像我一样，不缺也报缺，不是把社会主义道路堵塞起来了吗？”这些话是可以打动那些渴望走社会主义道路，但暂时被人为的粮食紧张的虚假现象所蒙蔽了的广大农民的。此外，报纸还注意揭露坏分子破坏粮食统销工作的活动，来教育农民提高政治警惕性。
    党的报纸在报道党和国家政策贯彻的过程中，还应该着重地反映党组织和党员的作用。广西日报在整顿粮食统销工作的报道中就注意了这一点。例如报纸在关于桂西僮族自治区直属县的整顿粮食统销工作的报道中，就报道了横县四、九两区的党员，有百分之九十在工作中起了积极带头作用。群众反映说：共产党员确能做到大公无私。除了在一般的报道中反映党组织和党员的活动以外，报纸还特别在党的生活栏里集中地报道了农村党组织和党员在这一工作中的领导和核心作用。在五月十四日的党的生活栏内就报道了党员淡周宗以身作则做好整顿粮食统销工作的事例；在五月十八日的党的生活栏内又报道了来宾县三区召开党员大会解决了粮食统销工作中的问题。
    广西日报的这些报道再一次证明了：有政治方向的、战斗性的、多方面的新闻通讯，在宣传党的伟大的思想和政策方面，起着多么重大的作用。
