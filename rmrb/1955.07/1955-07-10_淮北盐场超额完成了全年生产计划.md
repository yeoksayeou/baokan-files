　　Huaibei Saltworks Exceeds Annual Production Plan
Editor:
    I am a trade union worker in the Huaibei Salt Area. I am writing to inform you that the workers of the Huaibei Saltworks have exceeded this year's annual production plan.

    The more than 10,000 workers of the state-owned Huaibei Saltworks have already achieved great success in the labor emulation drive. As of June 16th, the entire saltworks had produced more than 716,000 tons of salt, completing over 101% of the annual state plan, which is more than three times the output of the same period last year.

    In recent years, due to weather conditions, the production situation at the saltworks has not been good. At the beginning of salt production this year, through discussions of the annual state salt production plan, the broad masses of workers recognized the important role of salt production in national construction and people's lives. Everyone seriously put forward competition conditions, launched competitions, and displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and wisdom.

    In April and May, due to the dry weather, seawater was not drawn in, and there was a serious shortage of water. The ninth work area of the Second Saltworks found in the discussion of the May plan that the seawater raw materials were only enough for six or seven days. Worker Fu Caijing came up with the idea of digging cart ponds, connecting river routes, and then using windmills to pump water into the salt flats, ensuring the source of raw materials. In order to quickly turn seawater into the semi-finished product of salt – brine – the workers, regardless of the scorching sun, organized manpower to scoop water on the vast salt flats. Through the concerted efforts of all the workers, by the end of May, the water shortage problem in the entire saltworks had been solved. The seventeenth work area of the First Saltworks, due to securing water sources, produced more than 10,000 dan (unit of weight, approx. 50 kg) of extra salt.

    Beginning in March, through technical classes, production meetings, organized observations, and exercises, the advanced production experience of Liu Guoxi (National Salt Industry Labor Model) was promoted throughout the saltworks, greatly reducing technical accidents. For example, in April, the number of dry ponds only accounted for 1% of the total number of salterns. On the night of May 26th, there was a 30mm heavy rain. The workers, according to Liu Guoxi's "leaching brine" experience, operated effectively, not only did not suffer any loss of brine, but also accumulated a large amount of brine. The seventh saltworks alone increased the brine by 7,700 ponds. Workers throughout the saltworks rescued salt piles in the gale and rain, from late at night until dawn, their entire bodies were soaked, but no one complained. Everyone was happy that thousands of dan of salt were rescued.

    At present, all the workers are confidently striving for a large surplus production. On June 18th, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing that they would guard against arrogance and rashness, be conscientious and diligent, and strive to produce one million dan of salt for the whole year, completing 141% of the annual plan!

### 淮北盐场超额完成了全年生产计划

　　淮北盐场超额完成了全年生产计划编辑同志：
    我是淮北盐区的一个工会工作者。现在我把淮北盐场职工超额完成今年全年生产计划的情况告诉你们。
    国营淮北盐场的一万多职工在劳动竞赛中已经取得很大成绩。到六月十六日为止，全场已产盐七十一万六千多吨，完成了全年国家计划的百分之一百零一强，为去年同时期产量的三倍多。
    近年来由于天时的影响，盐场生产情况不好。今年开晒时，通过讨论全年国家产盐计划，广大职工认识了盐业生产对国家建设和人民生活的重要作用。大家认真提出了竞赛条件，展开竞赛，并发挥了高度的劳动热情和智慧。
    在四、五月份，因为天时亢旱，没有纳入潮水，缺水现象很严重。第二制盐场九工区在讨论五月份计划时发现海水原料只够用六、七天了。工人伏彩景就想出了挖车塘，沟通河路，再用风车把水打进滩内的办法，保证了原料来源。为了迅速把海水制成盐的半制成品——卤，工人们不顾灼热的太阳，在广阔无垠的盐滩上组织人力戽水。经全场职工的一致努力，到五月下旬，全场缺水问题已经解决。第一制盐场十七工区由于争取了水源，多产盐一万多担。
    从三月份开始，通过技术课、生产会议、组织观摩、演习等方法，在全场范围内推广了柳国喜
  （全国盐业劳动模范）的先进生产经验，使技术事故大大减少。如四月份干池数只占全部晒池数的百分之一。五月二十六日夜里下了一场三十公厘的大雨，工人们根据柳国喜的“淋卤”经验进行操作，不但没有使卤水遭受损失，而且增积了大批的卤水，单第七制盐场就增积了卤水七千七百塘。全场工人们在狂风暴雨中抢救盐堆，从深夜一直到天明，混身都湿透了，但谁也没有叫苦，大家都为上千担盐被抢救上来而感到高兴。
    目前，全场职工正满怀信心地争取大量超额生产。他们在六月十八日写信给毛主席，保证要戒骄戒躁、兢兢业业，为全年产盐一百万担，完成全年计划百分之一百四十一而奋斗！
