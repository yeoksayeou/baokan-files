Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 3rd. Prominent Indonesian painter and secretary of the Indonesian People's Cultural Association, Sudjojono, published an article in Jakarta's "Life Daily" on the 2nd, praising the Chinese Cultural Delegation's first performance in Indonesia.

Sudjojono said that the initial impression of the Chinese Cultural Delegation's performance is that the superb performances of the Chinese artists are a powerful demonstration of human talent.

Sudjojono praised the Peking Opera performed by the Chinese Cultural Delegation, saying that although we do not understand the Chinese language, our two peoples can communicate through brilliant performance techniques. He mentioned the Peking Opera "Farewell My Concubine" and said that through every movement of the male and female leads in this play, through the movements of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and mouths, and through their movements of walking, running, and jumping, their inner feelings were fully expressed, and the entire story was revealed.

Sudjojono said, when talking about Ye Shengzhang's performance of the Peking Opera "Havoc in Heaven," that the actor successfully performed the role of the monkey with vivid, lively, and humorous movements, which is actually a dance of magic. This success can only be achieved after a long period of study and effort. Speaking of the Peking Opera "Stealing the Immortal Herb," he said that people watched the amazing scenes in the play in stunned silence. All the dance movements are very complex and closely, appropriately intertwined, and are full of beauty.

Sudjojono praised the performance of the "Lotus Dance," saying that the "Lotus Dance" exceptionally beautifully and simply describes China's beautiful land and bright future. He also praised Dai Ailian's performance art in the dance "Grandfather Carries Grandson on His Back."

    新华社雅加达三日电　印度尼西亚著名画家、印度尼西亚人民文化协会秘书苏佐诺二日在雅加达“生活报”发表文章，赞扬中国文化代表团在印度尼西亚的首次演出。
    苏佐诺说，中国文化代表团演出的初步印象是，中国艺术家们精湛的表演是表示人的才能的有力证明。
    苏佐诺赞扬中国文化代表团演出的京剧说，虽然我们不懂中国语言，但是我们两国人民能够通过精采的表演技巧进行交谈。他谈到京剧“霸王别姬”时说，通过这个剧中的男女主角的每个动作，通过他们的手、眼睛、眉毛和嘴的动作，通过他们走、跑和跳的动作，他们内心的感情都充分表现出来了，而且全部故事也揭晓了。
    苏佐诺在谈到叶盛章演出的京剧“闹天宫”时说，演员以生动活泼和幽默的动作，实际上是一种舞蹈的奇技，成功地表演了猴子的角色。这种成功是只有经过长时期的学习和努力以后才能够达到的。他在谈到京剧“盗仙草”时说，人们对剧中的惊人场面看得目瞪口呆。所有舞蹈动作都是很复杂和紧密地、恰到好处地交错着的，都充满了美感。
    苏佐诺赞扬“荷花舞”的演出说，“荷花舞”异常美丽和朴素地描述了中国美丽的国土和光明的前途。他还赞扬戴爱莲演出的舞蹈“祖背孙”的表演艺术。
