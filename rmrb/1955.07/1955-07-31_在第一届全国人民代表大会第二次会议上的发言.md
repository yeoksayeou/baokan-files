I am filled with great joy and excitement to participate in this meeting and to listen to all the reports. Last year, at our first session, we adopted the Constitution of our country, which clearly outlined the path to a prosperous and powerful socialist society. This year's session further determines the specific methods and steps to achieve this socialist society.

The tasks of this conference are to discuss and decide on the first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy, to review and approve the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, to draft the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, to adopt the decision on the Yellow River Plan, and to approve the work report of the Standing Committee, among other things. During each discussion and each report, I was deeply moved. I felt excited and honored.

Our first Five-Year Plan is a great blueprint for building socialism. It will completely change the face of our national economy and lay the initial foundation for building a socialist society. In the short few years since liberation, we have not only rapidly completed the restoration of the national economy but have also successfully begun large-scale, planned economic construction. Who else but the Chinese working class, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao could create such unprecedented miracles?

Our national budget is a very stable, construction-oriented, and peaceful budget. It is entirely dedicated to developing production and continuously increasing the welfare of the people. The execution of the budget has improved year by year. In 1955, the budget allocated 47.72% to economic construction, fully embodying the principle of key construction and the wishes of the entire nation for peaceful construction. At the same time, it also ensures the successful completion of our planned economic construction.

The implementation of the compulsory military service system is a completely necessary and significant matter in the current international environment in which our country finds itself. On one hand, our country has joined the peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. On the other hand, we are still surrounded by the aggressive bloc led by American imperialism. To strengthen our national defense and to safeguard world peace, we must continuously strengthen our people's army. Replacing the volunteer military system with compulsory military service greatly enhances the strength of our army while also saving national expenditures, allowing the younger generation to receive education and training in defending the motherland.

The Yellow River Plan has a special significance for the people living in Wuhan. Last year, Wuhan faced the threat of a once-in-a-century flood, but life in the city continued as usual. Without the attention given by the Chinese Communist Party to water conservancy work and the concern for the safety of people's lives over the past few years, the residents of Wuhan would have suffered greatly. The Yellow River has long been the biggest trouble for our country. Now, we are going to control it, no longer allowing it to harm the people, but instead making it serve the people. This is a great task. Our country has a saying: "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will people live?" Even the young people can see that the Yellow River will soon have power stations built, and the banks will be covered with green crops and wheat waves. Even someone like me, who is older, is fully convinced that the Yellow River will soon transform from a muddy river that harms the people into a clear stream that benefits the people.

Comrades, all our work revolves around one goal: to make our motherland prosperous and strong, to improve the welfare of the people, and to build a happy and prosperous socialist society. To achieve this goal, everyone has a responsibility, and everyone should strive to play their part to the fullest. I often think about this issue and frequently ask myself, what can I do for the socialist construction of our motherland?

I am a private entrepreneur. In the past, I only knew about my own enterprise, thinking that if I managed my enterprise well and developed it, that would be my contribution to the people and the country. Over the past five years, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have continuously educated me, and I gradually came to understand that the issue is not as simple as I had thought. The general task of our transitional period is to build a happy socialist society that eliminates poverty and exploitation. Private ownership of the means of production hinders the further development of our productive forces, and the anarchic state of capitalist economics is opposed to the planned development of socialist economics. I love our motherland and look forward to the beautiful future of a socialist society, but I myself am a capitalist entrepreneur. How can I resolve this contradiction? I think every private entrepreneur will face this problem.

I sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we private entrepreneurs have found a path to socialism, which is the path of state capitalism. Through state capitalism, the personal interests of private entrepreneurs and the interests of the state are combined. We private entrepreneurs not only can carry out enterprise reforms but also have the opportunity for personal reform, allowing us to gradually change our thinking and become healthy citizens of a socialist society when it is built.

In the construction of our country's first Five-Year Plan, after private industry and commerce are integrated into the state's planned track, they still have a certain role to play. We cannot abandon our responsibilities. We must work together with the people of the entire nation to strive for the complete realization of the state's first Five-Year Plan. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "The responsibility of capitalist entrepreneurs in the Five-Year Plan is to obey the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working masses, operate businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, honestly follow the state plan, and do well the tasks entrusted by the state, and accept socialist transformation. In this way, they can correctly play their due role in the Five-Year Plan and make a certain contribution to the Five-Year Plan." I assure the conference that I will definitely do this, and all entrepreneurs in the country will definitely do this. Some private entrepreneurs are pessimistic and passive, relying entirely on government arrangements and abandoning their own initiative and active efforts. This is completely unacceptable and shows a lack of responsibility. Among them, there are even some who violate the Constitution, engage in activities harmful to the public interest, disrupt social and economic order, sabotage the state's economic plan, and use more cunning methods to commit the "five poisons" and other illegal acts. This is resistance to socialist transformation and must be punished by law. This year, the government, in order to further utilize, restrict, and transform private industry and commerce, has implemented the "comprehensive planning and overall arrangement" policy. The production and operation of private industry and commerce have improved, and most enterprises have made profits. We private entrepreneurs must correctly understand the significance of the government's comprehensive planning, and we must sincerely and honestly strive to further transform ourselves, work hard at our posts, and together with the people of the entire nation, strengthen our efforts to advance with the great motherland.

Comrades, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the united efforts of the people of the entire nation, our motherland is like the rising sun, flourishing and prospering. Our friends are all excited about our achievements. But domestic and foreign enemies are strengthening their sabotage activities, attempting to drag our country back to the miserable position of a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has sounded an alarm for us, showing that the American Kuomintang reactionaries are doing everything they can to sabotage our great socialist construction. Therefore, to ensure the glorious and great cause of ours is successfully completed, we must always be vigilant and must resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionary activities, thoroughly eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan" and discussing in detail the draft of the first Five-Year Plan proposed by the State Council, we recognize that during the five-year period from 1953 to 1957, our national economy will develop rapidly. The total industrial and agricultural output value will increase from 827.1 billion yuan in 1952 to 1,249.9 billion yuan in 1957. This plan also reflects the transformation of the national economy. The proportion of heavy industry output value will increase, while the proportion of light industry output value will decrease; the proportion of state-owned, cooperative, and joint-venture industry and commerce will increase, while the proportion of private industry and commerce will decrease; individual agricultural and handicraft production will gradually move from low-level to high-level cooperative production. These changes indicate that our economic development plan is to gradually realize the industrialization of the state and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, thus meeting the requirements of the state's transitional period. After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, we know that the execution of the 1954 national budget was good, and the 1955 budget is in line with the spirit of the national economic development plan, which shows that the plan proposed by the State Council is feasible. I fully support this plan and the reports of the two vice premiers.

I am a medical worker. I know that doing a good job in people's health and hygiene work is a powerful guarantee for the smooth development of industrial and agricultural construction. At present, the development of our medical and pharmaceutical industry is lagging behind the development of the economy and the needs of the people. In these five years, we will establish six new higher medical schools nationwide and enroll 57,600 new medical and pharmaceutical students. At the same time, we will increase hospital beds by 100,647, sanatorium beds by 39,150, clinics by 641, district health stations by 4,028, and industrial and mining health stations by 746. We medical workers are both infinitely excited to see the new development of the people's health industry and feel the great responsibility. To complete this arduous task, I believe that medical workers must do the following three things:

First, we must do a good job of uniting traditional and Western medicine. By 1957, the total number of doctors in China will be 390,000, but among them, 324,000 are traditional doctors, while only 66,000 have received medical school training. It is impossible to rely on 66,000 doctors to guarantee the health of 252.4 million workers and more than 500 million rural and urban populations. However, adding 324,000 traditional doctors forms a powerful medical team. In recent years, following Chairman Mao's instructions to promote traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine, some large cities have established traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, many hospitals have set up traditional Chinese medicine departments, and more hospitals have established traditional and Western medicine consultation systems. The initial results of Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine have proven that many traditional Chinese medicine methods are scientifically based and effective. Traditional and Western medicine must further unite and learn from each other. The promotion of traditional Chinese medicine will also guarantee the health of the broad laboring people.

Second, we must do a good job of cultivating new forces. In these five years, China will have 26,600 graduates from higher medical and pharmaceutical schools, and in 1957, there will be 54,800 students in school. This is a powerful force. This new force must be cultivated into medical and health personnel who are both morally and intellectually excellent, physically healthy, able to master modern scientific knowledge, and have a Marxist worldview. Cultivating this new force is not only the responsibility of teachers in higher medical and pharmaceutical schools but also the responsibility of all medical workers. Now, some medical workers in medical and preventive institutions do not want to accept medical students for internships, thinking that students' internships increase their workload, or even if they accept internships, they think that leading internships is only the responsibility of medical school teachers. This is not entirely correct. In fact, medical workers in medical and preventive institutions have accumulated a lot of experience in actual work, and in today's severe shortage of teachers, they should all take on the responsibility of cultivating a new generation.

Third, we must do a good job of improving the current cadre. Carrying out scientific research work and improving the scientific level of the current cadre is an urgent task. "Give us time to engage in scientific research work" has become the unanimous call of scientists. This requirement is correct and necessary, but at the same time, we scientists must also carry out self-reform to do a good job of scientific research in the new era. First, scientific research must serve socialist construction, so scientists must continuously improve their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, making theory combine with practice, technology combine with politics, engaging in both deep theoretical exploration and meeting the needs of the people. Next, carrying out scientific research work must be based on learning from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's scientific work has a strong ideological leadership and a complete organizational structure, thus producing the most advanced science and technology, and Soviet science is of the socialist type. Soviet scientists have more than 30 years of experience serving socialist construction, so Soviet science is the most in line with the requirements of New China. These principles are easy to understand, but when it comes to implementation, obstacles often arise. For us, some scientists who have long been educated in capitalist ideology, the process of learning from the Soviet Union is a process of struggle between new and old thoughts, a process of struggle between materialism and idealism. We must resolutely learn from the Soviet Union, using Soviet scientific thought and methods, combined with China's actual situation, to carry out research work.

Comrades, the tasks before us are arduous, but as long as we strive to improve our scientific and political levels, vigorously cultivate new forces, and do a good job of uniting traditional and Western medicine, we have the confidence to complete the great task of medical workers in the first Five-Year Plan.

I am an opera singer, an ordinary music worker. After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," I have been excited and happy these days, just like everyone else, because the Five-Year Plan has unfolded a brilliant picture of a socialist society in front of us. We will gradually realize our fairy-tale-like dreams in our own country. In the fairy tale world, people can sit on a piece of felt and fly into the sky, blow a breath to turn the earth into gold, and have a sage come out to make the Yellow River clear. Now, our economic construction plan will turn all these dreams into reality. The water of the Yellow River will soon be clear. For a happy and beautiful life, we firmly support the first Five-Year Plan and will use our strength to realize the Five-Year Plan.

The socialist cause has made the fate of the motherland and each of us even more closely connected. While feeling happy, we also deeply think about how to contribute more to this sacred cause. As a vocal worker, we should use our voices to inspire the people's labor enthusiasm and fighting spirit. In the past, we have performed in the struggle, and these performances have also received the support and encouragement of the people. But today, if we raise our work to the level needed for building a socialist society, it seems that our work is far behind.

In recent years, our great victories in various basic construction projects, such as the restoration and expansion of Anshan Steel, the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Kangding Highway, the construction of the Foziling Reservoir and the Guanting Reservoir, and the bustling labor life in every corner of the country, have not been deeply and vividly reflected in music and singing. On the industrial and agricultural production front, many heroes and models have emerged, but we have not sung them out, and we have not sung out the true feelings of millions of laboring people. Therefore, the songs have not spread widely and have not been passed down. The call to liberate Taiwan has stirred up such a huge wave in the hearts of the people nationwide, but if we look at the few songs about this topic, they are still far from matching the people's indignant emotions. Many singers are overly fond of love songs like "The river flows gently, my brother is like the moon walking in the sky" and "The river rises with sand, a pair of carp and a pair of shrimp." In our concert programs, most of them are love songs like "Beautiful Girl," "The Girl on the Opposite Mountain," and "In that distant place, there is a good girl." Of course, these songs are also loved by our people, but we cannot say that the people do not like works that are more exciting and reflect the current construction and struggle, in addition to describing love. This is just due to some singers' artistic bias. They think that only such love songs and some works that they think can show singing skills can be used as solo songs for vocalists. As for the theme of the work, its realism and the depth of thought it expresses, as well as the needs of the broad masses, are rarely considered. This makes our singing monotonous, weak, and detached from reality and the masses. At the same time, our vocalists also have a serious phenomenon of not being among the people. Singers are used to answering the audience's applause under the spotlight, but they rarely use various opportunities to go to construction sites, mines, factories, rural areas, and the front lines to sing for those who are building socialism and defending the motherland with intense labor. Our literary and artistic work, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, has a fighting tradition. We should not let down this great era of socialist construction. We should launch a new singing movement, use our voices to sing about our people's cause, let our laboring people sing and advance on the construction front. Let our songs truly become the joyful, advancing, and victorious voices in our construction and struggle life.

Following the development of economic construction, our cultural undertakings will certainly flourish, which puts forward the problem of improving our vocal workers' artistic cultivation. We want to sing beautiful songs for the people, so we must pay attention to technical training. We must fight against the attitude of being indifferent to our profession. We must work hard, diligently, and love our work, like Mr. Mei Lanfang, who devoted his life to continuously improving his artistic level, making himself truly familiar and beloved by millions of people. At the same time, we must cherish our national artistic heritage. We should be happy to have such a rich heritage. We should change the wrong view that folk singing is "primitive," "unscientific," and "backward," and change the wrong idea of blindly worshiping Western bourgeois art. We should oppose replacing our lively and varied folk singing with a singing method that is actually detached from the masses. Chairman Mao's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy is the only correct principle for developing our singing art.

Not long ago, our art troupe's performance in Paris was enthusiastically received. Our Peking opera art, rich in national characteristics, shocked the French art world. They said they had never encountered such fresh and vital art. They said this performance was an unforgettable glorious victory. This fully shows that our art has a very high value. We inherit these precious artistic legacies, face the great reality of construction and the great people, and have the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. We will definitely do a better job. I think it is necessary to point out here that the guidance of Marxism-Leninism thought is extremely important and absolutely necessary for the music work team. Now, what hinders the development of our art is not something else, but the impure thought and organization of the art team. This makes us need to launch a thorough struggle to clean up the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionaries within our team, and further launch a criticism of bourgeois idealist thought to strengthen and build our literary and artistic team.

The thriving great construction is unfolding before our eyes. We vocal workers must work hard, shoulder the responsibility of singers in the struggle, and use our magnificent and fighting songs to promote the completion of the great Five-Year Plan and the thorough realization of the socialist construction cause!

I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I fully agree with and enthusiastically support them. What particularly makes me deeply moved and excited is the report on the first Five-Year Plan. I think this is an unprecedented great event in our country's history, a good news for six hundred million Chinese people, and a symbol of our journey towards prosperity and happiness.

Did the past feudal dynasties have "plans"? They did. What they "planned" was only how to satisfy their extravagant and licentious lives and how to consolidate their dynasties passed down from generation to generation. Did the Kuomintang reactionary government have "plans"? They also had. What they "planned" was only how to fill the pockets of the "Four Families" and how to sell the interests of the state and the people to curry favor with imperialism. They "planned" how to squeeze the people and then slaughter the people. If it comes to a genuine national economic plan for the benefit of the country and the people, not only is it impossible, but it is not even imaginable. Representatives! Only today, only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only under the superior people's democratic system, only with the selfless help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and the great support of the people of the whole country, can we spend 700 million taels of gold in the first Five-Year Plan period to carry out this large-scale national construction. Moreover, we also have the full confidence to realize this great plan. From the content of this Five-Year Plan, I see the brilliant future of the motherland, the happiness of the people of the whole country, and the happiness of future generations.

The state's first Five-Year Plan has been implemented for more than two years. In the planned year, the state has made significant changes and progress. From the Korean War ceasefire, the Geneva Conference, and the Bandung Conference, we have achieved brilliant victories, and our international status has been unprecedentedly raised. Through a series of social reforms and national construction work, the material and cultural life of the people has been improved. This time, I followed the instructions of the Standing Committee and visited Shanxi Province for half a month, which made me fully understand this. At the same time, I learned a lot of new things, received a profound enlightenment and education.

The focus of our visit was on the unified purchase and sale of grain, mutual aid and cooperation movement, and social order in three aspects. Shanxi is a prosperous and wealthy province economically and a region that was liberated relatively early politically. In the past few years, due to the correct leadership of the party and government at all levels and the efforts of the masses, achievements have been made in all aspects. The rural landscape has been renewed. The problem of unified purchase and sale of grain, although Shanxi had suffered from the destruction of the Japanese invaders and bandits and some natural disasters in the past, after liberation, due to the unprecedented improvement of farmers' enthusiasm for production, agriculture has not only been completely restored but also increased production in various places. Farmers generally understand and enthusiastically support the grain unified purchase and sale policy. However, this work is new, and everyone's experience is insufficient. Some places have gone through a detour. Because the production and consumption of farmers were not fully investigated, some cadres emphasized unified purchase while neglecting unified sale, and the boundaries of food and surplus grain were not clear, resulting in some high and low phenomena. But these shortcomings were immediately overcome. Now, with the wise "three fixes" policy, the grain work will definitely be done better. As for the mutual aid and cooperation movement, Shanxi's development is very fast. By April this year, the province had 31,926 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 40% of the total households in the province joining the cooperatives. After the farmers organized, they worked actively and increased production. But the work of agricultural production cooperatives, according to our visit to different types of cooperatives this time, is very complex and detailed. To do a good job of agricultural production cooperatives is not a simple matter, especially in the problems of scoring, accounting, property handling, labor allocation, etc., it is not easy to grasp. Therefore, some cooperatives have the phenomenon of not being united, and the production enthusiasm is affected. But these problems can be summarized and improved immediately. As for social order, the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries are relatively serious. They spread rumors, incited, wrote counter-revolutionary slogans, poisoned, set fires, and even assassinated. The characteristics are that the methods are becoming more cunning, and the means are becoming more vicious. From last winter to this spring, six months saw 170 cases of assassinating cadres and the people, killing 93 people. There were also cases of inciting farmers to petition for grain, destroying seedlings, deliberately wasting land, burning corn, and various counter-revolutionary incidents. In short, before the government took decisive measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the situation of social order was relatively serious.

Comrades, I have three suggestions for the conference to consider:

(1) Demobilized soldiers have received the party's cultivation and long-term organizational and disciplinary education in the army. Their political level is relatively high. In the agricultural production cooperatives we see, those led by demobilized soldiers do a better job. They are principled and can implement policies. I think it is very appropriate to use as many demobilized soldiers as possible in the grassroots cadres and agricultural production cooperatives.

(2) In small cities, some construction workers have certain skills and have played a certain role. But today, most of their work is to accept government contracts. Some departments emphasize saving money one-sidedly, not in line with reality, and reduce the contract price. These construction workers have no other work to do, so they have to accept the low contract price, which affects their lives. In the future, it seems that the wages of these construction workers should be regulated according to their actual living needs.

(3) In the countryside, single-tenant households are generally those with less or weaker labor force and less or poorer land. Some agricultural production cooperatives do not want to absorb them, saying that they will become a burden after joining, so they give up leading and educating them. Single-tenant households themselves also have wrong thoughts, thinking that their land is less and the dividend is less, the labor force is less, and they cannot "win over others," and they earn less money, which is not enough to live on. Some even say: "Not free, can't bear the hardship." This makes 50% of the land and farmers not organized, and the state plan and production are affected, and the transformation of farmers is also obstructed. In the future, we should help them improve production, strengthen their education, and absorb them into the cooperatives as soon as possible.

Finally, I request the conference to recommend that the government severely punish Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, who are anti-party and anti-people. In the future, we must be more vigilant, thoroughly clean up all hidden counter-revolutionaries within the people, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. I resolutely support the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, enthusiastically support the call for comprehensive savings, and strive for the realization of the state's first Five-Year Plan to build a great socialist new China!

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan.

The first Five-Year Plan is a great step for our country's socialist industrialization. In the first Five-Year Plan, the investment in the railway sector is considerable, and the tasks assigned are very heavy. Within five years, more than 4,000 kilometers of main and branch railways will be built, plus the restoration, reconstruction of old railways, and the construction of new double tracks, totaling more than 10,000 kilometers. The railway freight volume in 1957 will be 186% of that in 1952, and the freight turnover in 1957 will be 201% of that in 1952. Such tasks would be unimaginable in the old China. However, in the new China, we railway workers have full confidence and determination to ensure its completion. Because leading us forward is our great Communist Party and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we fear no difficulties, and we have full confidence in victory. In the past two and a half years, we have already completed 40% of the Five-Year Plan for railways. In the next two and a half years, we will make even greater efforts to ensure the full and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan's glorious tasks assigned to us. To achieve this goal, we railway workers will make efforts in the following aspects.

First, we will resolutely implement comprehensive savings, oppose all waste, and deeply launch labor competitions to strive for the realization of the national railway increase-production and savings plan. In 1955, we will ensure that the transportation cost is reduced by 1.05% as originally planned, the major repair project cost is reduced by 4%, and the cost of affiliated enterprises is reduced by 2%, to save the country's precious construction funds.

Second, on the operating railways, we will further launch the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements, strive to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, and fight to increase the average net load of freight cars to 32.5 tons, over-axle traction to 40 million tons, and save 66,000 tons of coal.

Third, in the construction of new railways and basic projects, we will further launch the "good, economical, fast, safe" labor competition, reduce non-production buildings, cancel unreasonable, premature, and overly high-standard investments, improve design and construction quality, shorten the construction period, ensure on-time or early delivery for use, and can reduce the original total investment (after deducting the value of rails and beams, etc.) by 26.9%.

Fourth, in the labor competition, we must strengthen labor discipline, seriously implement the regulations, orders, technical management procedures, and technical operation processes issued by the Ministry of Railways. Only in this way can we overcome waste, implement the savings plan, ensure quality, reduce costs, and ensure the safe completion of transportation and basic construction tasks.

Fifth, in the labor competition, we must strive to learn, improve technology, learn from Soviet advanced experience, promote the advanced experience of the Changchun-Liaoning Railway, and launch rationalization suggestions to push the labor competition forward.

We are fully aware that to complete the tasks assigned by the Five-Year Plan, we need to make great efforts. At the same time, we also know that the class enemies are not reconciled to any of our victories. Therefore, we must further strengthen the unity of all railway workers nationwide, continuously improve class consciousness, be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage at all times, and drive out all hidden counter-revolutionaries to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and the successful implementation of the first Five-Year Plan.

I fully support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am willing to strive for the full realization of the first Five-Year Plan and the various tasks proposed in these reports.

Yunnan is a multi-ethnic province, with great disparities in the social development of various ethnic groups and economic backwardness. It is also located on the border of the motherland, with both internal and external environments being relatively complex. To complete the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation, we need to work more carefully and prudently and carry out more arduous and complex struggles. In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the central government, the various ethnic groups in the province have been closely united and worked hard, and both industrial and agricultural production have completed the state's plans. However, in our actual work, there are still many shortcomings, and even some mistakes have been made. In rural work, some people have resistance to socialist transformation, and when they see the tight supply of grain in some rural areas this spring, they immediately think that the government has bought too much grain from the farmers and sold too little, intending to modify the state's unified purchase and sale policy. In fact, since liberation, Yunnan has increased grain production every year, with no external transfer tasks. The grain controlled by the state, except for maintaining a certain stock to meet necessary needs, more than 80% is used for unified sale. It is precisely because of the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy that the market has been stabilized and the supply of cities, industrial areas, and rural areas with grain shortages has been guaranteed. Of course, there are shortcomings in the cadres' implementation of policies, but this cannot be used as a basis for doubting the unified purchase and sale policy. However, we have not correctly analyzed this incorrect view of rural conditions from the essence of class struggle, the boundary between socialism and capitalism is not clear, and there has been a wavering in thought, indulging the above-mentioned wrong thoughts, relaxing the control of grain supply. This has opened the door for speculators and rich peasants to engage in speculation and hoarding, once causing a mess in the grain market and artificially aggravating the tension in rural areas. Although this mistake has been corrected, it is still an important lesson we should learn. In adjusting the public-private ratio of commercial retail, there have also been cases of unprincipled retreat and relaxation of the transformation of capitalist commerce in some aspects. Other aspects of work also have similar situations of unclear thought boundaries and indecisiveness. We must change this situation, improve our thinking, and strengthen our firmness in principles to ensure that various tasks proceed steadily.

The socialist revolutionary cause is carried out in a sharp and complex class struggle. Moreover, Yunnan was once a stronghold of the Kuomintang reactionaries, where they intended to make their last stand. There are many open and hidden counter-revolutionaries. The American Kuomintang bandits are also sending a large number of spies and agents into the country, so the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is even more intense. But we have many cadres who are satisfied with some achievements during the reform period and have developed a sense of arrogance, lacking vigilance and strength in the struggle against internal and external enemies. They strike hard against openly exposed enemies but are more complacent and negligent towards hidden and more sinister counter-revolutionaries who use two-faced tactics. Similar to the counter-revolutionaries arrested in Jilin Province, such as Zheng Dianming, we have discovered many cases in Yunnan Province. The situation of sleeping with tigers is very serious. In the past year, many cadres, activists, and laboring people have been killed by counter-revolutionaries using various cruel means. Many cases of counter-revolutionary arson have also been discovered, and many large and small sabotage incidents caused by counter-revolutionaries hidden in industrial and mining enterprises have been found, causing serious losses to state and people's property. The counter-revolutionaries' sabotage activities in border minority areas are particularly prominent, openly looting, murdering, spreading rumors, and trying to incite ethnic relations, create ethnic conflicts, and sabotage our country's national defense. The reason why counter-revolutionaries are so rampant is, of course, due to historical and social reasons, but the most dangerous thing is that there are serious complacency and various confused views among our cadres and the people around us. Some cadres think that hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang bandits have been eliminated, the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the growing strength of the people make a few remaining counter-revolutionaries insignificant. This view is very harmful. In addition, some people think that counter-revolutionary activities are created by the pressure of the revolution. Based on this fallacy, it seems that as long as the people put down the weapons of people's democratic dictatorship, the counter-revolutionaries will put down their butcher's knives and behave properly. The fact is the opposite. The reason why counter-revolutionary activities are rampant is precisely because our cadres are complacent and have relaxed the pressure of the revolution. Some people even advocate treating counter-revolutionaries with "benevolent rule." Chairman Mao has already severely criticized this wrong view in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." According to investigations in five areas including Kunming, a considerable number of counter-revolutionaries have continued their counter-revolutionary activities after various lenient treatments, still opposing the people. This shows that the incorrect implementation of the policy of combining leniency with severity, being too lenient with counter-revolutionaries, is tantamount to indulging counter-revolutionaries, seriously harming the interests of the people. Some people even openly declare that counter-revolutionaries "do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death," which is standing on the wrong side and openly defending counter-revolutionaries. These serious complacency and confused views, if not corrected, will continue to indulge and encourage counter-revolutionary activities, giving counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to take advantage of. The facts learned by the representatives of the National People's Congress during their inspection in Yunnan have made us more aware of the necessity of thoroughly eliminating all counter-revolutionaries. Only in this way can we effectively consolidate the border defense of the motherland and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause. Yunnan has more than 20 ethnic groups, each at different stages of historical development, with their own ethnic characteristics. It is of special importance to seriously implement the provisions of the Constitution that "the state will consider the needs of various ethnic groups in economic and cultural construction and will fully consider the characteristics of various ethnic groups in the socialist transformation issue." In the inland ethnic areas, land reform has already been carried out, and we must help the farmers of various ethnic groups to actively and steadily walk the road of cooperation—this is the road to completely get rid of poverty and achieve common prosperity, and it is also the road to completely solve the ethnic issue. In the border ethnic areas, due to different situations, land reform has not been carried out. In recent years, by implementing the cautious and steady policy and the policy of unity, production, and progress, ethnic unity has been strengthened, and the awareness of the people of various ethnic groups has been raised, and the social situation is gradually changing. In some areas, the masses of some ethnic groups and most of the public figures who have contact with the masses are increasingly feeling that the feudal land system seriously hinders the further development of their ethnic group and the further unity within their ethnic group, so they voluntarily request to solve the land issue in a peaceful and consultative manner. After repeated consultations and discussions by the ethnic autonomous organs and consultative organs, and after conducting pilot tests, it is proven that this approach is feasible; it satisfies the demands of the masses while also considering the interests of ethnic public figures, which is beneficial for strengthening ethnic unity, developing production, and consolidating national defense, and for gradually transitioning to a socialist society and creating conditions. However, the situation in the border areas is complex, and in the implementation of the peaceful consultation policy, we should continue to implement the cautious and steady policy, carry out meticulous and arduous work, and strictly follow the policy. We must act according to the demands of the masses and ethnic upper-level leaders, and we must not force anything. We must also pay attention to preventing deviations.

As for the areas where conditions are not yet available for reform, we should continue to implement the policy of unity, production, and progress. To ensure the completion of various tasks in the border and inland ethnic areas, we must seriously implement the ethnic regional autonomy policy stipulated in the Constitution, ensure that ethnic minorities exercise their autonomy rights, make the autonomous organs fully function, vigorously cultivate and promote ethnic minority cadres to meet the needs of the work.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech at the first session: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." The people of various ethnic groups in Yunnan must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite more closely, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, improve their ideological level, overcome various shortcomings and mistakes, enhance vigilance, consolidate national defense, work diligently, overcome difficulties, increase production, practice thrift, and strive with the people of the whole country to realize the state's first Five-Year Plan!

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The control and development of the Yellow River's water resources is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country. The people of various ethnic groups in the middle reaches of the Yellow River in Gansu have long been eager to control the Yellow River. This wish can only be realized in the new era of people's democracy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When the Yellow River Survey Team organized by the Central People's Government, consisting of Soviet experts, Chinese experts, and responsible comrades from relevant departments, conducted surveys in Gansu in 1954, they were warmly welcomed by the people of various ethnic groups. Now, after hearing the report of this great plan, I am even more excited and happy.

According to the first phase of the comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River, in Gansu, the Liujiaxia comprehensive project and the Qingtongxia main stream dam project will be constructed. After the completion of these projects, Gansu's power generation will increase by 2,800 times compared to 1952, the increased irrigated farmland will be equivalent to 20% of the total irrigated land in the province in 1954, the navigable distance of the Yellow River within the province will reach more than 900 kilometers, and the water disasters along the Yellow River, especially the "spring ice jam" from Jinji County to Mengkou County, will be completely eliminated. At the same time, with the large-scale development of water and soil conservation work, the natural landscape of Gansu will be fundamentally changed from the root, allowing the people of various ethnic groups to gradually get rid of the threat of drought, and the development of agricultural production will have a reliable guarantee. All these will have a very important impact on the socialist construction and socialist transformation of Gansu, and on the improvement of the material and cultural life of the people of various ethnic groups in Gansu. We enthusiastically support this great plan that benefits the country and the people and are determined to do a good job in all aspects related to the control of the Yellow River under the unified planning and leadership of the central government, especially to do a good job in water and soil conservation, to support and guarantee the realization of this great plan.

Most of Gansu is in the loess area, with about three-quarters of the province being mountainous, with bare mountains and deep gullies; the average annual rainfall is about 300 millimeters, with the highest reaching 600 millimeters and the lowest only 42 millimeters, mostly concentrated in July, August, and September, and many places often experience heavy rain; water and soil loss is very serious. Tianzhen, Pingliang, Qingyang, Dingxi, and other special districts have most of their mountainous and original land eroded into gullies. The people say: "The mountains are like a monk's head, the bottom has no water flow, if you walk carelessly, you will fall into the gully." Wuyi, Jiuquan, Yinchuan, and other special districts have become semi-deserts. Liupan Mountain and other areas have become barren stone mountains. According to the measurements of the Shaan County Wenxian Station, every year, about 330 million cubic meters of silt flow into the Yellow River from the Jinghe, Weihe, and Zuli Rivers and other tributaries of the Yellow River within Gansu, containing about 11 million tons of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers. The nitrogen alone is equivalent to 1,000 times the nitrogen contained in the soybean meal supplied this year. Such serious water and soil loss is the root cause of the frequent occurrence of water disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and is also the fundamental reason for the decrease in soil fertility, low crop yields, and frequent droughts in Gansu. According to historical records, from 1671 to 1929, Gansu experienced 139 droughts. In addition, the reactionary rulers of the time squeezed the people, causing great losses to the lives and property of the people of various ethnic groups. The severe drought of 1929, for example, resulted in nearly a million victims, with nine out of ten households suffering, and many people dying.

For a long time, the people of various ethnic groups in Gansu have fought tenaciously against the phenomenon of water and soil loss and accumulated a lot of experience. However, due to the constraints of reactionary rule and the feudal land system, as well as the limitations of scientific and technological conditions, it was impossible to achieve greater results. After liberation, the people's government led and helped the masses to focus on some water and soil conservation work. By 1954, the province had completed field projects in more than 2 million mu, 7 large and small water retention projects, more than 20,000 various water channels, more than 40,000 water dams, ponds, and wells, more than 19,000 flood control ditches, more than 6.4 million mu of "water-soaked land," and expanded the planting area of alfalfa and grass to more than 730,000 mu. These projects have played a certain role in alleviating water and soil loss locally and increasing grain production. At the same time, under the guidance of the Central Water and Soil Conservation Station, Tianzhen, Qingyang, and other regions have also established some relatively successful models and gained a lot of experience. Wushan County's Dengjiaba Village, originally a barren mountain village, has begun to show the scene of "every field has a ridge, every ridge is connected, trees are lush, grass is everywhere, mud does not flow out of the gullies, water does not flow out of the fields"; the grain yield, which was 100 jin per mu in 1952, increased to 160 jin per mu in 1954. Out of the 25 households in the village, only 2 households could eat and live in 1952, but now 22 households can.

Of course, these projects are only the beginning. Compared with the great task of changing the natural landscape, they are still very small. In the future, we must follow the comprehensive plan of the central government for controlling the water disasters of the Yellow River and developing the water resources of the Yellow River, combined with the specific situation of Gansu, mobilize all forces, actively and on a large scale, carry out water and soil conservation work. Our preliminary plan is: within 15 years, in the eastern and central regions, complete water and soil conservation field projects in 40 million mu of mountainous and original land, build 2.6 billion cubic meters of river and gully projects in the gullies, and build 24 million mu of "water-soaked land." In the areas with serious water and soil loss, plant 550 million mu of alfalfa and grass. In the Jinghe, Weihe, Zuli Rivers, and other tributaries of the Yellow River and mountainous areas, plant 99 million mu of water source forests, bank protection forests, slope protection forests, sand control forests, and economic forests; and in the northern Helan Mountains, eastern Zhongnan Mountains, and western Qilian Mountains, plant 100 million mu of forests. After the implementation of this plan, the phenomenon of water and soil loss in most areas of the Gansu Loess Plateau will be basically stopped, the drought will be alleviated, many barren gullies and riverbeds will become fertile fields, the mountains will begin to turn green, and agricultural production will be more guaranteed. Just in the central and eastern regions, the 40 million mu of mountainous and original land that has undergone water and soil conservation, if each mu increases production by 20 jin, it will produce an additional 800 million jin of grain each year. The lives of the people of various ethnic groups will also be greatly improved. At the same time, the silt in the middle and upper reaches of the Jinghe, Weihe, and Zuli Rivers and the Zuli River will be greatly reduced, creating favorable conditions for the control of the Yellow River.

Water and soil conservation work is a long-term, systematic, and large-scale work to transform nature, which requires the close integration of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. We need to conduct comprehensive surveys and planning throughout the province, uniformly arrange the distribution of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and rationally organize the production of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Under the overall plan, implement specific plans in one county, one township, and even one village or one cooperative, so that water and soil conservation and agricultural production are closely integrated, and various economies complement each other, preventing and overcoming contradictions between them. According to the characteristics of various regions in Gansu, we need to grasp different links and take different measures. For example, in the Qingyang and Pingliang highland gully areas, we should focus on protecting the original land and gullies, combined with equal-height planting and deep plowing and dense planting. In the Tianzhen gully area, we should focus on protecting gullies and slopes, combined with the construction of economic forests. In the Dingxi drought area, we should focus on drought resistance, build "water-soaked land," dig ponds and wells, plant more autumn crops and drought-resistant high-yield crops, and promote alfalfa and grass. In the Liupan Mountain stone mountain area, we should focus on flood control and waterlogging prevention, build terraces, store water, intercept silt, and build a large number of forests and grass. In the Bailong River forest area, we should focus on protecting existing forests and promoting the construction of economic forests and medicinal materials. In the Wuwei, Jiuquan, and Yinchuan sandstorm areas, we should focus on fixing sand dunes, preventing sand, protecting fields, and building protective forest belts.

Water and soil conservation is a mass work. Carrying out this work will inevitably bring about a series of changes in the production and life of the masses, and at the same time, it requires the active support and hard work of the broad masses. Just as some farmers say: "Thousands of gullies need thousands of people to treat." Therefore, we need to strengthen the ideological education of the farmers, eliminate various concerns, make the masses understand the importance of water and soil conservation work, and understand the consistency of immediate interests, long-term interests, and overall interests. At the same time, we must correctly implement various related policies. For example, afforestation must implement the principle of "who plants, who owns; who plants together, who owns together; the village plants, the village owns"; in the evaluation of land for joining agricultural production cooperatives, there should be some consideration for land improvement, etc. What is particularly important is that the development of water and soil conservation work must be closely combined with the agricultural cooperation movement, combining the transformation of nature with the transformation of individual economic ownership. Individual farmers have a certain enthusiasm for water and soil conservation, but under the conditions of scattered small peasant economy, land is interspersed, interests are contradictory, labor force is insufficient, and material conditions are difficult, it is impossible to carry out water and soil conservation work in the same catchment area, combining upstream and downstream, left and right, and cooperating to control water and soil loss. While mutual aid and cooperation organizations generally have higher socialist awareness among their members and are more willing to accept technical reforms and scientific knowledge; in terms of labor force, funds, and the reasonable use of land, they also have better conditions, which makes it easier to implement various measures that individual farmers find difficult to carry out alone. Therefore, only by relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations can we mobilize the collective power of the masses and promote water and soil conservation work; and water and soil conservation work can also enrich the production content of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, making individual farmers more aware of the superiority of organization, which is more conducive to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Water and soil conservation work is a new work, so we need to pay attention to summarizing and promoting the effective experiences of the masses. In recent years, the people of various ethnic groups in Gansu have accumulated a lot of experience in this regard, but we have not done a good job of summarizing and promoting. The main problem at present is no longer how to try it out, but how to promote experience and carry out work. In the future, we need to pay more attention to this aspect, strengthen specific leadership, educate cadres, cultivate activists among the masses, impart scientific and technological knowledge, and enhance vigilance to prevent counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, so that water and soil conservation work can be firmly and actively promoted step by step.

The Liujiaxia comprehensive project and the Qingtongxia dam project have been included in the first phase plan. The people of various ethnic groups in Gansu must support these projects from all aspects, do a good job in the survey, design, and preparation for construction, and do a good job in the resettlement of the reservoir area. As for other people who need to move to Gansu, we warmly welcome them and provide them with necessary help in production and life.

Comrades, the beautiful future of the Yellow River is unfolding before us. The ideal that countless people have yearned for for thousands of years will be realized in our generation. Just as Chairman Mao said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our ancestors have never done." For the socialist future of our country and the happiness of our descendants, we must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the great ally, the Soviet Union, actively mobilize, and strive to realize the great task of controlling the water disasters of the Yellow River and developing the water resources of the Yellow River as soon as possible!

After listening to the reports and speeches of the vice premiers and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I am indescribably happy and sincerely support them from the bottom of my heart.

The first Five-Year Plan discussed at this conference is to lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country, with a focus on developing heavy industry. I fully support this. Only in this way can we consolidate national defense, liberate Taiwan, strike back at imperialist aggression, and defend our happy lives; only in this way can we provide farmers with tractors and various new agricultural tools, making our agriculture gradually move towards collectivization and mechanization.

The leaders are right. Developing industry is the key, but we must also develop agriculture. Developing agriculture is also very important. In national construction, the task undertaken by all farmers in our country is very heavy and very glorious. The agricultural development plan stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, we must strive to complete, and we must strive to exceed it.

I am the chairman of the Wugong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province. Wugong Township is fully cooperative, and Raoyang County is now also cooperative. More than 84% of the households in the county have joined the cooperative. The path of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation indicated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the path for farmers to permanently get rid of poverty and the path for farmers to gradually become rich. Take the Wugong Township cooperative as an example. From its establishment in 1943 with only four households in the "Land Cooperation Group," it has now developed into a large cooperative with 419 households. Ten years ago, we had no plows, so we had to use large hoes to till the land. Now, not only do we have a set of new horse-drawn agricultural tools, 20 seven-inch plows, 33 large carts, and 103 draft animals, but the state has also established a tractor station in our township, and more than 40% of the land has been mechanized. In the past, the whole township had only a dozen water wheels, but now there are 68 water wheels, and there are also two mechanized wells.

The Second Session of the First National People's Congress was held in Beijing from July 15th to July 28th, 1955. During this session, various representatives delivered speeches expressing their support for the country's development plans and policies. Below are the translated speeches from the representatives.

**Speech by Sun Dehe (孙德和代表发言)**

The reports given by several vice-premiers at the conference and the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, I fully agree with and will enthusiastically support with the greatest enthusiasm. I also hope that all scientific and technical personnel in the country will closely unite with the people of the whole country to strive for the realization and over-fulfillment of the five-year plan.

I am a technician who has been engaged in steel smelting since the old society. Like many other technicians, I once had some naive and simple ideas about improving industry to enable the broad masses of the people to live a good life and to resist imperialist aggression. After liberation, I truly realized that under the rule of that evil old society, this was just an illusion.

From the past facts of the steel industry and today's comparison, it is obvious. The establishment and destruction of the Hanyang Steel Plant left us only a painful historical memory. The steel plant built during the Sino-Japanese War in Shijingshan could not be put into operation. The steel plants that the reactionary government had been calling to build for a long time were not realized, and their scale was also very small. In the past, the development of the steel industry had to rely entirely on a few imperialist monopolists and their design institutions, who of course only cared for themselves and the reactionary regime, and could not be for the Chinese people.

Today, the five-year plan stipulates the development of a huge steel industry, and several steel bases will be established, which are the world's first-class steel and iron combined enterprises; after detailed investigation and research, the most advanced technology achievements in the world are adopted; the largest, most efficient, and most economical equipment is selected; the operation is mechanized and automated; and the most advantageous use of resources is guaranteed. Why is there such a sharp contrast? In fact, Chairman Mao's words, "Without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry," have long explained this problem. Moreover, the Soviet Union has sincerely and selflessly helped our country to carry out socialist industrialization with the spirit of internationalism, while imperialism does not want our country to industrialize.

From the mid-19th century to the present, the growth rate of steel production in capitalist countries is about 25 years to double, while we have increased by 3.06 times in five years, equivalent to their 38 years, and our growth rate is approximately 7.5 times their average growth rate. The total production of pig iron in the capitalist world in 1950 was only 1.6 times that of 1918 (during which the production in 1932 regressed to only half of that in 1918), while we increased by 2.46 times in five years. Our growth rate, from the situation, will continue to accelerate, which is indeed a great miracle. For these great achievements, how can we not be excited and jubilant, how can we not cheer for these brilliant and dazzling achievements, how can we not sing praises for our superior system and great leadership?

The five-year plan not only greatly develops the steel and metal industries but also invests heavily in the machinery industry. We will have heavy machinery factories and a series of machinery factories. With these factories, we can manufacture more heavy equipment for heavy industry, establish more industrial bases and related important industries. I have a deeper understanding of the words of revolutionary leader Stalin: "Metal is the foundation of all industries" and that the machinery industry is the heart of industry. We will be able to better develop industry, consolidate national defense, and safeguard the cause of world peace.

What excites me even more is that we have a plan to control and develop the Yellow River. The Chinese people will soon see with their own eyes that the Yellow River, which has threatened the lives and safety of the Chinese people for thousands of years, will be tamed. Its immense power will serve irrigation, navigation, and power generation according to the will of the people. Everyone's heart is filled with boundless joy, and it is difficult to express our inner feelings in words. This engineering plan is like a beautiful poem, which can shake the heart of every person and the whole world.

Of course, in the long-term situation of scientific backwardness and lack of talent in our country, it will not be without difficulties to complete these major constructions in a short period. However, we have the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the wise Chairman Mao. We also have the selfless technical and material support of the brotherly countries led by the Soviet Union and their experts. I have full confidence that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and complete the five-year plan.

Soviet experts have helped us recover and build, and they have also cultivated a large number of technical personnel in the process of work. Under the guidance of the experts, the design strength of China's black metallurgy factories has increased significantly in a few years. At the beginning of 1953, there were only a few people gathered from all sides, and it can be said that at that time, everyone did not know how to do design work. In more than two years, through the guidance of experts and practical work, the design strength and ability have been significantly improved, and a certain amount of work has been completed. A considerable amount of construction drawings have been completed, playing a certain role in the construction. Under the guidance of the experts, the design units are currently cultivating the ability to design general steel plants and mines or individual workshops within them. However, it must be said that in terms of establishing systems, obtaining design materials, and improving levels, all aspects are inseparable from the guidance of experts and the support of the Soviet Union. We are sincerely grateful for the great and selfless help of the Soviet Union.

However, design work is complex and difficult, and the technical level of designers is still very low, with a considerable gap from the needs of the situation. In the past work, there have been many errors and serious shortcomings. For example, designs often change, drawings have errors, and often need to be modified, which causes delays in construction, idle work, and accumulation of materials, resulting in great losses. In the future, we must strictly check, correct errors, learn from experience and lessons, and carry out the struggle of thrift and against waste.

In terms of learning, designers not only need to study technology and advanced science of the Soviet Union diligently, but also need to learn their thoughts, work methods, and styles. We deeply feel that we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialist thought methods, criticize the remaining idealist concepts, be vigilant, and greatly improve the political and ideological level of designers, so as to overcome many errors of localism, liberalism, and subjectivism, and to implement socialist design ideas, to implement the concept of the whole, economic accounting, improve labor productivity, and make the design products truly represent the combination of politics, economy, and technology. In addition to the design of expansion, the design unit must also cultivate the ability to design new, large, and complex steel and iron combined enterprises, and cooperate closely with scientific research, basic construction, and production units to provide more metal materials and special materials for the construction of our country in the future.

Only through long-term diligent study and work, accepting criticism, and correcting shortcomings, can we guarantee that in the construction of a socialist society in several five-year plans, we will complete the glorious task that design workers should undertake, and truly support the five-year plan with actual actions, and thank the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

**Speech by Chen Yongkang (陈永康代表发言)**

I fully support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the development of the national economy and Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the national budget for 1954 and the national budget for 1955. I have also fully agreed with the reports of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

After three years of national economic recovery, our country entered the stage of planned economic construction in 1953. The central task of our country in the transitional period is socialist industrialization, and the key link of socialist industrialization is to give priority to the development of heavy industry. Under the guidance of the principle of the overall task of the transitional period, the draft of the first five-year plan of our country allocates a total of 766.4 billion yuan, of which 427.4 billion yuan is allocated for basic construction, and 248.5 billion yuan is allocated for the industrial sector, accounting for 58.2% of the basic construction investment, and other sectors account for 41.8%. The draft allocates in this way, which is based on the scientific law of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Only with such a scientific deployment can we establish a powerful heavy industry in our country, so that we can manufacture modern industrial equipment by ourselves, to technically transform our industry, agriculture, and transportation, to consolidate our national defense, to continuously increase the production of agricultural products and consumer goods, and to improve the material and cultural life of the people. These plans are completely correct and are in line with the long-term and immediate interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

This plan is planned for the whole country, aiming to change the unreasonable situation of industrial concentration in the coastal provinces of the old China, and to distribute industrial production forces appropriately in various parts of the country. Therefore, in addition to actively building new industrial bases in North China, Northwest China, Central China, and other places, partial industrial construction has also begun in Southwest China. Therefore, we can foresee that even in relatively backward areas like Guizhou, we will gradually walk on the road to industrialization, and the many ethnic minorities distributed in Guizhou will be liberated from the economic backwardness and hardships that have lasted for thousands of years. We also see that this plan is a meticulous and comprehensive plan for the whole country, and the industrial construction in various regions is carried out according to specific needs and possibilities, with a clear order of priority. Some regions should immediately carry out large-scale construction, while some regions need to be postponed for a step. After discussing the draft of the five-year plan and listening to the reports, I have further clarified in my mind that industrial construction must have a center and concentrate forces on key points, rather than evenly distribute forces everywhere. I am a local official and should always strengthen the overall perspective to avoid deviations in understanding. Looking back at my past thoughts, they were somewhat distant from the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. If we overly emphasize local interests or overly emphasize the local, without considering the coordination of light and heavy, urgent and non-urgent in the whole country, the speed of industrialization will slow down. This is not only not good for the industry of the whole country but also not good for the local in the end. The industrial deployment of the five-year plan is in line with the interests of national socialist construction and the interests of the people of Guizhou Province of all ethnic groups.

While increasing production and accumulating funds to build heavy industry, it is also correct to correspondingly develop agricultural and other construction projects. From the perspective of the need for agricultural development, I think that the amount of investment in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy stipulated in the draft plan is not small; moreover, as the report says, these investments plus the investment of farmers themselves in expanding reproduction are enough to meet the needs of farmers. In the current situation where industry is still backward and agriculture is only initially moving towards cooperation, if too much investment is made in agriculture, it will not only affect the concentration of funds needed for industrial construction but also may not be able to play the role of investment in agriculture. I think the investment of the draft plan in agriculture is correct and can complete the task of increasing production.

From the spirit of the five-year plan, our Guizhou ethnic minority areas should take the development of mutual aid and cooperative agriculture as the center to implement the task of agricultural increase production stipulated in the five-year plan, to produce more grain and other technical crops to support national industrialization, and to serve the 156 key projects and other industrial construction and national defense consolidation. Therefore, walking the road of mutual aid and cooperation has become the key link for the ethnic minorities in Guizhou Province to move from backwardness to advancement.

We must rely on the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to prevent wasteful behavior in construction, and we must resolutely fight against waste to make our country's wealth fully play its role in developing production. In order to prevent waste, we strongly support the principle of reducing non-production construction standards stipulated in the plan. In this regard, our past work has been seriously wasteful, which shows that our past understanding of the principle of accumulating socialist construction funds through thrift is still insufficient, and we must resolutely correct it.

In general, to realize the five-year plan, we must vigorously implement the instructions of the Central Committee on thrift and against waste, carry forward the spirit of hard work and concrete work, and save unnecessary expenses on the basis of living within our means to strive for the realization of the first five-year plan.

**Speech by Sun Zuobin (孙作宾代表发言)**

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country and the reports of the conference. The first five-year plan is a plan of historical significance to fundamentally change the economic face of our country. We must strengthen our learning, work diligently and conscientiously, and strive for the realization of this great plan.

Qinghai is a region with a vast territory and sparse population, and a weak industrial foundation. The total area of the province is about 820,000 square kilometers, with only 1.7 million people. Due to the fact that the Yangtze River and the Yellow River both originate in Qinghai, the soil is fertile, and the grass is lush, the potential and prospects for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry are great. According to our preliminary survey, there are about 30 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed in the Qaidam Basin alone, and there are vast natural grasslands that can increase the number of livestock by about 10 million head, but at present, more than 95% of this region is uninhabited. In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, the grass is lush, and it is truly said that "the wind blows the grass low to see the cattle and sheep."

In recent years, we have, based on such a vast and beautiful natural environment with great development prospects, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, and through the unity and efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, achieved remarkable results in agricultural and animal husbandry production. By 1954, the grain production had reached self-sufficiency in the province, changing the situation of grain shortage for many years; the number of large and small livestock had reached 12 million head, more than doubling the number in 1949. We believe that with the realization of the first five-year plan, agricultural and animal husbandry production will achieve greater development. By 1957, the number of organized households will reach 85% of the total households, of which 48% will join agricultural production cooperatives; the irrigated area will be expanded by more than 500,000 mu; 400,000 mu of wasteland will be reclaimed; the grain production will increase by 36% compared to 1952; the number of large and small livestock will reach 18 million head. The poor herdsmen in the pastoral areas account for about 20% of the total households. Since liberation, we have used loans and relief to actively help them solve production and living difficulties, and some of them have already established households, and their production and living difficulties have been basically solved. In the future, we will continue to provide loans and relief to herdsmen who still have difficulties, to help them solve their difficulties.

Although the industry in Qinghai is weak, the underground resources are extremely rich, and the prospects for industrial development are also great. According to preliminary surveys and understanding, the underground resources in Qinghai, such as oil, coal, and rare metals, are all abundant. The state has begun large-scale prospecting work on these underground resources. We believe that with the development of the national industry, especially heavy industry, it will not be long before chimneys of factories will stand on the Qinghai grassland and smoke will rise.

The development of the Qaidam Basin is a major issue directly related to the development of the national economy and the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. Therefore, we have listed the support for the prospecting work of the Qaidam Basin as one of the main tasks for 1955. All levels of cadres and people of all ethnic groups are excited about the state's start of the development of the Qaidam Basin and are very active and enthusiastic in supporting the work.

Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region. Since liberation, we have vigorously promoted the system of regional ethnic autonomy, widely united the public figures who have connections with the masses of all ethnic groups, actively mediated ethnic conflicts, and thus strengthened ethnic unity. However, due to historical legacy, ethnic barriers have not been completely eliminated, and hidden counter-revolutionaries and reactionary landlords and rich peasants are still trying to find loopholes to sabotage ethnic unity. These enemies' methods of sabotage are very cunning and vicious, mainly disguised as religious figures or using ethnic relations. Hidden counter-revolutionaries also use arson, robbery, spreading rumors, and even organizing open armed rebellions to sabotage our production. Reactionary landlords and rich peasants also use incitement of middle peasants and poor peasants, infiltration into mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and other methods to actively sabotage the mutual aid and cooperative movement. The lessons of these sabotage activities are serious. This fully proves that the more the revolutionary cause advances and the more victories it achieves, the more vicious and poisonous the sabotage activities of the enemy will be. Therefore, to achieve the victory of the first five-year plan, we must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries, oppose any complacency, and pay attention to blocking all possible loopholes that counter-revolutionaries can use in our work.

To achieve the victory of the first five-year plan, we must also actively respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to oppose waste and practice thrift. Although our Qinghai's scale is small, the phenomenon of waste is still serious. For example, the waste in the construction of the Xining Hotel reached 20% of the total construction cost, and some organs, schools, factories, and mines have occurred phenomena of false reporting of population and wasting grain, and there are also many other wastes. Some state organs' staff do not yet understand the principle that modern life should be based on the modernization of industry, and thus there is a thought of pursuing modern life too early. In addition, because we have not done enough propaganda and education work on increasing production and saving for the people of all ethnic groups, there are also some phenomena of waste among a part of the people. These are not conducive to the realization of the first five-year construction plan of our country, and we must vigorously overcome and prevent them in the future work.

**Speech by Coqiao Denzhu (卓饶登珠代表发言)**

At this conference, I listened to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the development of the national economy and the first five-year plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the national budget for 1954 and the national budget for 1955, read the draft of the first five-year plan and other related documents, and after discussion and study, I learned a lot, improved my understanding, and further strengthened my confidence in building socialism. I sincerely support the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country and other related documents, and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

The first five-year plan is an important step in realizing the overall task of the transitional period of our country. Its proposal points out a more specific goal of struggle and a clearer direction of advance for the people of the whole country in realizing the overall task of the transitional period. Therefore, it will receive the enthusiastic support and active support of the people of all ethnic groups.

The first five-year plan, with the development of heavy industry as the center, is completely correct. Because only by developing heavy industry can we establish a powerful material foundation for our country's socialism, making our country strong and the people happy; only by developing heavy industry can the state have the power to help ethnic minorities develop various construction projects, changing the backward economic status of the ethnic minorities in our country. Therefore, concentrating the main forces to develop heavy industry is in line with the long-term interests and highest interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country; and the formulation of the first five-year plan is also the embodiment of the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

In March, the Seventh Plenary Session of the State Council decided to "help Tibet to carry out construction projects," including the construction of water and power stations and leather factories in Lhasa and Shigatse, and the construction of public roads and river embankments, which have been included in the first five-year plan. Therefore, the Tibetan people not only need to continue to actively support and assist the People's Liberation Army and cadres entering Tibet, take the initiative to do a good job of unity and work, but also need to actively participate in various construction projects. We understand that supporting and assisting the People's Liberation Army and cadres entering Tibet, doing a good job of the current work in the Tibetan region and the construction projects decided by the State Council to help Tibet, is to cooperate with the overall construction plan of the state, and at the same time, it is to lay the foundation for further construction in Tibet. Therefore, the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country are completely consistent.

Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army and cadres entering Tibet have faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's policy on ethnic minorities, religious policy, and the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, earnestly respected the equality of ethnic minorities, religious beliefs, and customs, and in extremely difficult conditions, did their best to help the Tibetan people develop production and construction, gradually improving their material and cultural living conditions. The Tibetan people, under the great ethnic policy of Chairman Mao and the actual actions of the cadres entering Tibet, also actively participated in the support of transportation, procurement, and road construction. The Tibetan and Han peoples have developed a new relationship of friendship and cooperation through various practical activities in recent years; the Tibetan and Han cadres have also established a good relationship of mutual respect, mutual consultation, mutual learning, and mutual assistance in work and study. The unity of ethnic groups is an important condition for the construction of the motherland; and the unity of the Tibetan and Han peoples and cadres is an indispensable and more important condition for the construction of Tibet. Therefore, in the future, we must continue to strengthen and consolidate the unity of ethnic groups in our country and between the Tibetan and Han peoples, and further develop the friendly relationship of mutual respect and mutual learning between the Tibetan and Han cadres, and strive for the construction of the motherland and Tibet.

To complete the first five-year plan of our country, we must seriously cultivate various construction cadres; and to gradually develop the construction projects in the Tibetan region, we must vigorously cultivate local ethnic cadres. In recent years, the work of cultivating ethnic cadres in the Tibetan region has achieved great results. In addition to sending hundreds of Tibetan men and women to study in the interior, we have also paid attention to the cultivation of ethnic cadres in the local area through various practical work and social activities, improving their patriotism and actual work skills. From the current work needs and the development of construction in Tibet, the work of cultivating ethnic cadres must be further strengthened in the future, and it should be arranged in a more important and regular position to further strengthen this work from all aspects.

The construction of Tibet is a long-term and arduous task. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, with the help of the Han and other brotherly ethnic peoples and the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and the close unity and joint efforts of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, we will be able to cooperate with the construction plan of the motherland and complete the task of constructing Tibet smoothly.

The Tibetan people will, together with the brotherly ethnic peoples of the whole country, exert all their strength to strive for the realization of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country!

**Speech by Wang Zhen (王震代表发言)**

I enthusiastically support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I fully agree with the speech of Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways on reducing railway construction costs and am willing to implement it in the new line construction of the Railway Corps.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, in the construction of the Lianjiang to Zhanjiang and Yingtan to Xiamen railways, obtained the enthusiastic support of the local party and government leadership and the people, making the Lianjiang to Zhanjiang railway completed half a year ahead of schedule on July 1, 1955. The Yingtan to Xiamen railway is now concentrating forces to start construction throughout the line. The construction of these railways, with the help of Soviet experts, made the construction troops more able to learn the advanced experience of surveying, designing, and constructing in the Soviet Union. In the construction of the Yujian Bridge, we learned to use pneumatic caissons, various bridge-building methods, and the use of wind drills to excavate tunnel guide holes, and quickly mastered the operation of various mechanical tools, and the speed of manual track laying increased from 2.5 kilometers per day to 6.6 kilometers per day.

In many foundation constructions of bridge piers, we often encounter the impact of heavy rain and mountain floods, and the soldiers bravely rushed to rescue, protecting the safety and stability of the buildings, and many collective units achieved outstanding merits, including the famous rescue heroes Ye Chuanwen, Zhang Jiafang, and Luo Ganghui.

In the construction process, we often encounter heavy rain, mountain floods, typhoons, heat, and cold. To defend against and resist the invasion of adverse weather, this requires a detailed construction plan and a strong fighting will.

The sense of responsibility for loving socialist property and creative labor is also moving. Once, a sailboat loaded with steel rails from Guangzhou to Zhanjiang encountered a storm at sea, and the ship was tilted by the waves, and 51 steel rails fell into the sea. The water here is 40 meters deep even at low tide, and the mud at the bottom of the sea is 3 to 4 meters deep, making the salvage very difficult. The diving team leader Wang Quanfu and three divers volunteered to take on this task. They dived into the sea, with their bodies bearing huge pressure, and the work was very difficult, and there was also the danger of shark attacks. However, they regarded the property of the motherland as more important than their own lives. They worked continuously for a month to salvage the steel rails, renting a boat and buying ropes cost only 800 yuan, and salvaged 51 steel rails worth about 20,000 yuan from the sea.

In the process of building railways, we rely on the active leadership of the local party and government, mobilizing the people to participate in the construction of roads. At the same time, we also saw that counter-revolutionaries began to act when we started to arrange the construction, distributing printed newspapers, slogans, leaflets, shooting guns, burning warehouses, and trying to use feudal superstitions to sabotage. For example, when moving a tomb, counter-revolutionaries secretly incited the masses to demand 40 yuan to buy a coffin, resulting in the exposure of the counter-revolutionary organization by the local peasant masses. The peasants actively supported socialist construction, voluntarily proposed to move the tomb, and according to the traditional customs of laboring people, used earthen jars to hold the remains, and only 4 to 8 yuan was needed for each tomb.

The workers participating in the construction of the road are organized young and middle-aged men and women, and the women in Guangdong and Guangxi work as hard as the men. They are united with the Chinese People's Liberation Army like one family. The state's construction of railways not only makes the people see the prospects of economic and cultural development but also promotes the development of agricultural production cooperatives. The workers' team said that they learned the organizational methods of collective labor. They said, "Organization brings great strength, and labor efficiency is high." These all embody the superiority of our country's people's democratic system.

I fully support the call for "increasing production" and "practicing thrift." Since the National Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China, the People's Daily has successively exposed the phenomena of waste in basic construction, proposed specific measures for practicing thrift, especially Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the military cadre conference, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the issue of thrift, and Minister Teng Daiyuan's report to the State Council after inspecting the new line construction in the Southwest and Northwest, after transmission and study, greatly improved the enthusiasm of the construction troops for "increasing production and practicing thrift" and reducing railway construction costs. Everyone has started to think, check, and criticize the phenomena of waste in their own work, and can put forward reasonable suggestions for thrift. From the preliminary budget of the design of the Yingtan to Xiamen line, it can be seen that the original average cost per kilometer was 829,000 yuan. However, after the design, construction, and basic construction units worked together to conduct a field survey along the line, and under the guidance of Expert Sherbakov, widely carried out democratic discussions, criticized the blindly increased safety factor and the pursuit of high standards in the design, proposed design standards that are suitable for the line's traffic volume and mountainous difficulties, and modified inappropriate design standards, after the approval of the Ministry of Railways, and with the help of experts, studied the improvement of construction methods, saved materials, improved efficiency, and reduced indirect costs, the current budget per kilometer is reduced to 677,500 yuan. Although the Yingtan to Xiamen railway passes through mountainous areas, with many rivers and heavy rainfall (the average number of completely sunny days in five years is only about 50 days), we will continue to deepen detailed calculations after this National People's Congress, mobilize collective wisdom, guarantee the construction period, guarantee the quality of the project, and strive to further reduce the construction cost from the construction side, which is still possible. For example, to reduce non-production investment, there is such an example. The survey and design, basic construction, and construction units need to go to the Yingtan to Xiamen line construction site to work, which requires more than 30,000 square meters of housing. Originally, it was planned to build 26,000 square meters of houses, but under the personal guidance of Governor Ye Fei of Fujian Province, more than 30,000 square meters of houses and most of the furniture were vacated in a small town. These houses and furniture were vacated by the local party, government, and military. We saved the money for building these temporary houses. When we accepted the construction task of the Lianjiang line last year, Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai instructed: "Your headquarters should move to the construction site, and the Railway Corps should regard the construction site as a training ground and a cadre school, and if you don't know, go to the construction site to learn!" Experience has proven that this instruction is completely correct. The Railway Corps can do a good job in railway construction. Because there are many good conditions. Since the People's Liberation War, the Railway Corps has been established, and there are many excellent engineers and skilled workers on the national railways participating in the Railway Corps. Later, graduates from colleges and universities were also supplemented, especially the technical guidance of Soviet experts. This is the condition for us to do a good job; the Railway Corps, when it arrives at the construction site, not only obtains the enthusiastic support of the people but also the direct support of the leadership of the local troops, and all aspects such as supply and health are guaranteed, which is the condition for us to do a good job; the army's organizational discipline is strong, political awareness is high, and when the whole army is dispersed to the construction site, it is like a battle, and construction can be quickly opened, which is the condition for us to do a good job. We still have many shortcomings in the construction process, and there are still many phenomena of waste, which need to be overcome. Therefore, as long as we work diligently and conscientiously, avoid arrogance and complacency, study hard, and seriously establish the idea of economic accounting and improve the economic accounting system, we can become a shock brigade in peaceful construction, learn skills; in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, if imperialism dares to invade our sacred motherland, we can also guarantee the smooth operation of railways to support the victory of the heroic combat troops and branches. At present, we strive to complete the Yingtan to Xiamen line ahead of schedule.

I fully support the military service law of our country and the report of Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai. Young people, after being conscripted into the army and receiving modern military training, are also excellent workers in industry and agriculture. Modern workers in industry and agriculture are also excellent soldiers in modern national defense. As pointed out by Representative Liu Bocheng, after the implementation of the compulsory military service system, the broad "military in industry," "military in agriculture," and "military in education" national defense potential has been opened up. In this way, we can reduce the number of standing troops, save more funds to build industry. Therefore, the military service law is completely consistent with the great socialist construction of our country.

**Speech by Li Chuanjiang (李川江代表发言)**

I am an oil worker. I participated in this conference, listened to the reports of the four vice-premiers and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, read and discussed the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and I feel very happy and pleased. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our China will become a country with developed industry, prosperous and strong, and even the Yellow River will become clear. This is completely in line with the will and hope of the people of the whole country. Therefore, I fully agree with and enthusiastically support these reports and the draft of the five-year plan.

In his report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that socialist industrialization is the central task of our country in the transitional period, and the key link of socialist industrialization is to give priority to the development of heavy industry. This is completely correct. I now realize that the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry is the best way to make the country strong and the people happy. For example, in our country's oil mills, there are many traditional oil presses, and the equipment of a few mechanized oil mills is also outdated. Only when the heavy industry of the country is developed, can we mass-produce various new machines, and the oil industry can fundamentally change the situation of technological backwardness.

After reading and discussing the draft of the five-year plan, I have a deeper understanding of the great task of the workers in the oil industry. I used to think that the shortage of oil was not enough, and farmers should plant more oil crops. Now I realize that the average per capita land in our country is only about 2.5 mu, and it has to be used to produce grain, clothing, and other industrial raw materials needed by the country. Therefore, it is not enough to just plant more oil crops. We still need to vigorously tap the production potential of the oil industry. The vast majority of the oil industry in our country is equipped with outdated equipment and is technologically backward, which shows that the production potential is also very large. If we can seriously study technology and promote advanced experience in time, we will definitely be able to produce more oil. For example, our local state-owned Fourping Oil and Wine Factory has very outdated equipment, and the factory building was restored after being burned down in the war. In 1949, the oil extraction rate was only about 9 jin per 100 jin of soybeans. Under the correct leadership and support of the Party and the administration, and the education of the trade union, all employees have actively worked hard to study technology and seriously promoted advanced experience, and the oil extraction rate reached about 11 jin in 1950. Later, the oil extraction rate increased year by year, and now it is about 14 jin. We still have the confidence to further improve it.

The experience and achievements of the Fourping Oil and Wine Factory in recent years are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the government, and the support of the brother factories across the country. Especially in November last year, the Central Committee held the National Oil Industry Conference, which proposed the honorable task of increasing the production of 100,000 tons of oil for the country in 1955 on the basis of fixed raw materials in 1954; the conference also summarized and exchanged the advanced oil extraction experience of brother factories across the country, and called for a movement to increase oil production with the promotion of advanced oil extraction experience and the improvement of oil extraction rate as the center. The Fourping Oil and Wine Factory is responsible for the task of increasing production by 44,800 jin. Through the efforts of all employees, the semi-annual production increase task has been over-fulfilled by 0.3% in the first half of this year. The Fourping Oil and Wine Factory was able to over-fulfill the semi-annual production increase task mainly because it seriously learned and promoted the advanced experience of brother factories, such as the "single circle thin cake" of Taonan and the "no grass circle" of Dalian. With the advanced oil extraction experience of brother factories across the country, we have the confidence to definitely guarantee the completion and strive to over-fulfill the production increase task. The work of the Fourping Oil and Wine Factory also has many shortcomings. Some workers are arrogant, and some workers do not seriously implement the operating methods, causing great losses to the state. I realize that arrogance is a backward path, and I will go back to the factory to work with all the employees to overcome these shortcomings, seriously implement the operating methods, and actively learn advanced experience.

After the first National Oil Industry Conference last year, the relevant departments of the Central Committee issued the "Agreement on Oil Processing Methods." The initial implementation of this agreement has greatly promoted and improved the enthusiasm of enterprises and employees for management and production, and has begun to reverse the tendency of pursuing the amount of pressing and neglecting the improvement of the oil extraction rate. However, some places have not yet seriously implemented this agreement. We oil workers should, under the leadership of the Party, supervise the implementation of the oil processing methods.

The oil pressing industry is heavy physical labor. Since liberation, because the leadership attaches importance to it, many oil mills have improved the working conditions with little or even no money. But some places and oil mill leaders do not pay attention to this problem, so some oil mills still have problems such as long working hours or high temperatures in the workshop, which affect the health and enthusiasm of the workers. This should be paid attention to by the relevant departments.

We oil workers guarantee and with the working class and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, for the completion of the first great five-year plan of our country, we will exert our greatest efforts. The employees of the Fourping Oil and Wine Factory have launched a friendly competition with the brother oil factories across the country, and by the time I came to the meeting, we had received more than 100 letters of challenge from brother factories. Actively carry out the movement to increase oil production, this is our oil workers' practical action to enthusiastically support the first five-year plan. We will continue to seriously implement the spirit of the National Oil Industry Conference last year, earnestly promote the advanced experience of soybean, peanut, cottonseed, rapeseed, and other oil extraction, improve production technology, fully tap the potential of the existing equipment, and guarantee to over-fulfill the task of increasing production by 100,000 tons on the basis of fixed raw materials. Here, we would like to thank the support of the farmer brothers. To complete the task of increasing production by 100,000 tons of food oil, we must rely on the farmer brothers to sell the high-oil-content good grains to the state. We will continue to vigorously use various substitute oil materials to expand the oil sources for the state.

To guarantee the completion of the first five-year plan, we must also improve political vigilance and participate in the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries to protect our victory.

**Speech by Kang Keqing (康克清代表发言)**

I sincerely support the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the conference. The first five-year plan clearly points out that the key link of socialist industrialization is to give priority to the development of heavy industry, which is completely correct. Because only by establishing a powerful heavy industry can the country be strong, and only then can the living standards of the people be continuously improved, so that the broad masses of the people and future generations can be freed from poverty forever and enjoy a universally prosperous life. Here, I will only talk about the issue of child care and education in the five-year plan. The five-year plan stipulates: "Gradually develop the child care industry." It also points out that "within five years, according to possible conditions, appropriately develop kindergartens, and in cities, they can be organized by organs, groups, enterprises, and the masses, and in rural areas, it is advocated that agricultural production cooperatives organize them." This policy is completely correct. This not only allows the state to concentrate funds on key construction but also fully utilizes and develops the manpower and material resources of various aspects of society to gradually promote the child care industry, which is completely beneficial to socialist construction and socialist transformation.

We know that with the development of socialist construction, the number of women participating in various production and construction in cities and rural areas is increasing, and the demand for solving the problem of children's upbringing is becoming more and more urgent. If the problem of children's upbringing is not properly solved, it will affect the parents' production and work enthusiasm. Therefore, doing a good job in child care work can make parents actively produce and work, becoming a condition to guarantee the successful completion of the five-year plan. Therefore, we fully support the establishment of various forms of day care centers, day care stations, mutual aid, and individual foster care by organs, groups, enterprises, production organizations, and the masses. On the one hand, it can solve the problem of more women who participate in production and work but have no one to take care of their children at home, and on the other hand, it can also make children receive more reasonable upbringing. Experience has proved that this method is simple and convenient, does not cost much, meets the needs of the masses, and is welcomed by the masses. However, some parents think that day care cannot solve all their problems and require full-time care. They think that day care will increase troubles, and they think that taking care of children after work is an additional burden. They try to push the responsibility of raising children entirely to the day care centers and kindergartens. Some people think that the simple equipment and upbringing methods of day care are low-level and unsatisfactory, and require the state to spend more money to raise the level of day care centers as high as possible, while they themselves bear less expenses. These ideas are obviously not in line with today's social living standards, are contrary to the spirit of overall thrift for socialist construction, and are not in line with the responsibility of new Chinese citizens to cultivate a new generation with sound bodies and minds. Only by advocating the establishment of simple and convenient day care organizations can we make up for the lack of full-time organizations that cannot be universally established. Moreover, the manpower and material resources needed to run day care are only half of those needed to run full-time care, which not only reduces the economic burden on parents but also allows various organs and enterprises to more effectively solve the problems of more parents. At the same time, parents must also understand that day care centers and kindergartens cannot completely replace the responsibility of parents. The fact is that some parents have indeed fulfilled their responsibilities in raising children and accumulated a lot of experience, but some parents have adopted wrong attitudes towards their children's upbringing: some are indulgent and pampering, some are arbitrary beating and scolding, and some are indifferent to the good or bad of children's life and study, or treat children with methods of educating adults. These wrong attitudes are due to the influence of bourgeois and feudal residual thoughts, or due to the lack of new knowledge and methods of educating children. Therefore, parents and adults in society should educate children with socialist thoughts and viewpoints, thoroughly eliminate all incorrect thoughts, strive to learn the scientific knowledge of child upbringing, and set an example for children with their selfless labor spirit and excellent qualities for socialist construction. Educate children to love their country, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property; encourage school-age children to collect scrap steel and iron, help with household chores, and cultivate the habit of hard work and simplicity, and fulfill their glorious responsibility in the construction of a great motherland.

We all know that conducting socialist moral quality education is an indispensable part of socialist construction, especially to truly change the bad living habits and ideological foundations of the old society, we should start from the serious education of the next generation. Therefore, in the process of socialist construction, we must pay attention to the moral education of children. At present, there are still bourgeois class thoughts in society that are constantly influencing children, and thieves, hooligans, and counter-revolutionaries are trying every means to destroy the physical and mental health of children. Such as spreading various reactionary rumors to threaten and frighten children, using superstitions and ghosts to deceive children, using small favors to lure children, using reactionary, obscene, and absurd books to corrupt children, and even organizing hooligan gangs to commit theft or assault, and the most serious is that they, like beasts, rape young girls and sodomize young children. Therefore, we solemnly request that those who destroy children should be severely punished by law; request all citizens, starting from caring for and loving children, to supervise and expose the bad people and bad deeds that destroy children. At the same time, we sincerely request every parent and every teacher to seriously fulfill the responsibility of educating children. Any parent who, because of production and work, does not pay attention to educating and caring for their children; any teacher who only cares about the classroom and does not care about extracurricular activities, only teaches books and does not teach people; if teachers and parents cannot closely cooperate, relax the moral education of children from the family, school, and society, then they will give thieves, hooligans, and counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to take advantage of, and bring lifelong pain to children, which is a great sin to the state and society. We request all cadres and staff of state organs and people's organizations, especially Communist Party members, to set an example in educating children and caring for the next generation of the country. We also request all sectors of society to give enthusiastic care and support to children's work, especially the literary and artistic circles to create more for children, to enrich the knowledge of parents in educating children.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people's government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, a new wind of protecting and caring for children has been gradually and widely established in our country. With the implementation and completion of the first five-year plan, this will provide unprecedented good conditions for the growth of children. Let us make further joint efforts to raise a new generation of physically and mentally healthy socialist new people.

**Speech by Liu Jiuxue (刘九学代表发言)**

I fully support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country, the national budget for 1954 and the national budget for 1955, the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and the comprehensive plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River. I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and I will strive for their realization.

I am a worker from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. Since I was nine years old, I have been working in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. I am 50 years old this year and have been working in Jiaozuo for 38 years. Before liberation, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine was under the rule of foreign imperialism, especially Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The capitalists did not care about the lives of the workers, and ruthlessly exploited and oppressed the working masses. The workers' lives and lives were not guaranteed at all; the production conditions were extremely poor, and major accidents such as mine water, gas explosions, and underground collapses occurred frequently. In the year I was 18, the Dongsihe Coal Mine in Jiaozuo had a gas explosion, and 23 workers were seriously injured, with their hair and skin burned off. When the injured workers crawled out of the mine, they were in so much pain that they could only cry and scream, and no one took care of them, resulting in the death of 22 people. In the year I was 21, the Sihe Mine had a water inrush accident, and 30 workers were drowned in one go. Accidents with three or five casualties were common. The capitalists did not even ask about the workers' deaths. During the rule of Japanese imperialism, sometimes when workers died, the capitalists' response was: "The death of ten or eight people is nothing, there are plenty of workers." The workers' lives were even less secure. At that time, in addition to being oppressed and exploited by imperialism, they were also oppressed and exploited by feudal foremen. The capitalists gave workers very little wages, and the feudal foremen bought bad grain to distribute to the workers. The wages workers earned could not maintain the minimum living standards of the workers. In 1939, a worker's daily wage could only buy one and a half jin of bean skins. Workers who could work could barely maintain their lives, and once they were sick or old and could not work, they would be starved to death. In the dilapidated workers' dormitories, sometimes dozens of workers and their families would starve to death in a day, and after death, they would be thrown out of the window, and no one would take care of them. Under these circumstances, workers lived a miserable life and had no energy to work, and their production enthusiasm was extremely low.

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the political status of workers has been unprecedentedly improved. All levels of party committees and governments care very much about the lives and welfare of the working masses, improved production conditions, and paid attention to safety management. The broad masses of workers, after various social reform movements, have greatly improved their political awareness, realized that production is for themselves, established the attitude of labor as the master, fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, guaranteed safe production, and improved production efficiency. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine has not had any major work-related accidents since its liberation in 1948 until now, and no one has died from an accident. The main experience of safe production is: the leadership pays attention to safe production work, and there are specific measures for safe production; workers are constantly educated on safe production, making them understand the importance of safe production, and overcoming the idea of complacency. Let the workers master the safety technology, mobilize the workers to think of ways; strictly observe the labor discipline, work according to the safety procedures; clearly divide the work, establish a responsibility system, and establish a reward and punishment system; regularly inspect, find problems, and solve them in time, no matter how small the accident is, it must be seriously handled to prevent the recurrence and expansion of accidents. In short, as long as we rely on the masses, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. I will give an example here. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine has an old tunnel that has not been mined for decades. It is said that there are snakes and other poisonous insects inside, and no one dares to go in. There is coal that cannot be mined. After the masses thought of a way, they reopened this tunnel, and it is now being mined.

In recent years, under the condition of guaranteeing safety, technology has been improved and production has been increased. Before 1951, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine transported coal with backward coal baskets, pulling and carrying by hand, and the production efficiency was very low, with an average of only 0.8 tons of raw coal per person per day. In February 1952, after discussion with the masses, the small baskets were changed to large baskets, and the manual pulling and carrying were changed to small car transportation. In this way, each person can produce 1.6 tons of raw coal per day, and the production efficiency is doubled. In October 1952, the workers comrades also made efforts to learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, changing the small car transportation of coal to mechanical transportation, and adopting the coal cutting machine for coal mining, increasing the production of coal from 1.6 tons per person per day to 5 tons. Due to the improvement of technology, the current production has reached an average of 8 tons of raw coal per person per day, and the production efficiency has increased by 9 times compared to 1951. Due to the improvement of production efficiency, the production task for the whole year was completed 31 days ahead of schedule in 1954. At the same time, on the basis of improving labor productivity and production, the material life of workers has also been improved. Before liberation, workers' daily wages could only buy one jin of rice, workers had no place to live, could not eat enough, and could not keep warm. Now the lowest wage per person per month can buy more than 100 jin of grain, and more can buy about 1,000 jin of grain. Workers now eat fine grains, wear foreign cloth, gabardine, and woolen clothes, have hospitals set up by the state when they are sick, have old-age homes when they are old and cannot work, and have relief for families with special difficulties, and their lives are completely guaranteed.

Although we have achieved great results in our work, there are still many shortcomings, and we must not be arrogant and complacent. To complete and over-fulfill the production tasks assigned by the state to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine during the five-year plan period, we will, after returning, first of all, earnestly convey the spirit of the resolutions and various reports of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, assist the leadership in organizing all employees to study the various documents and reports of this conference, and advance towards the bright road pointed out by the five-year plan with the masses. Secondly, we will further carry out the labor competition movement, improve production efficiency, increase production, and reduce costs. In the labor competition movement, we will continue to play the role of labor models as the backbone, bridge, and leader, with the spirit of hard work, diligent work, and hard work, to mobilize the broad masses of workers; rely on the masses, consult with the masses on everything, and give full play to the collective wisdom of the masses; strengthen cultural and technical learning, promote advanced experience, and improve production technology; at the same time, always care about the lives and welfare of the masses. We will mobilize all comrades to strive to over-fulfill the state's plan for 18,000 tons of raw coal in 1955.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    陈经畬代表的发言
    我以高度欢欣鼓舞的心情，参加了这次会议，听取了所有的报告。我们去年第一次会议通过了我国的宪法，具体规定了我们走向富强繁荣的社会主义社会的道路。今年这次会议则进一步决定了走向社会主义社会的具体方法和步骤。
    我们这次大会的任务是讨论和决定我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，审查和批准一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算，制定我国兵役法，通过关于黄河规划的决定以及通过常务委员会的工作报告等等。在每次讨论和每次听取报告的时候，我都是非常激动的，我感到兴奋，我感到荣幸。
    我国第一个五年计划是一个建设社会主义的伟大纲领，它将完全改变我国国民经济的面貌，奠定我国建成社会主义社会的初步基础。解放后短短几年中，我们不但迅速地完成了国民经济的恢复工作，而且胜利地开始了规模这样宏伟的有计划的经济建设。这除了中国工人阶级的领导，中国共产党和毛主席的领导，谁还能创造这样空前未有的奇迹呢？
    我们的国家预算是一种非常稳定的建设性的和平预算，是完全为发展生产，为人民的福利不断增长服务的。预算的执行一年比一年良好。一九五五年的预算用于经济建设的支出占百分之四十七点七二，完全体现了重点建设的方针和全国人民和平建设的愿望，同时，也为我国有计划的经济建设胜利完成提供了保证。
    义务兵役制的实施，在我国当前所处的国际环境中是一件完全必要的大事。我国一方面已经结合在以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营中，一方面仍遭受着以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的包围。为了巩固我们的国防，为了保卫世界和平，我们就有不断地加强我国的人民军队的必要。以义务兵役制替代志愿兵制是大大地加强了我国军队的力量，同时又节约了国家的支出，使年轻的一代都能受到保卫祖国的教育和锻炼。
    黄河的规划，对于我们居住在武汉的人民来说，是具有特别亲切意义的。去年武汉遭受百年来未有的洪水的威胁，而市区内人民生活仍旧照常进行，这如果不是中国共产党几年来对于水利工作的重视，对于人民生命安全的关怀，我们武汉居民将不知有多少人已葬身鱼腹。黄河是我国向来为患最大的一条河流，现在我们要控制它，不再使它为害人民，而且要它为人民服务，这是一件多么伟大的工作。我国有一句谚语说：“俟河之清，人寿几何”，现在还年青的人，固然可以看到黄河将建立起发电站，沿河两岸将翻腾着绿油油的禾苗和麦浪；就是像我这样上了年纪的人，我也充分地相信可以很快地看到：黄河将由一条为害人民的浊水转变成为一条造福人民的清流。
    各位代表，我们各项工作都是环绕着一个目的，这就是为了我们祖国的富强，人民的福利，建成幸福繁荣的社会主义社会。为了达到这个目的，每一个人都是有责任的，每一个人都应该尽最大可能来发挥他的作用。对于这个问题，我是经常在考虑，不时地反问自己，我能为祖国的社会主义建设尽一些什么力呢？
    我是一个私营工商业者。过去我是只知道我自己的企业，以为我办好我的企业，发展我的企业，就是我对人民、对国家的贡献。五年以来，中国共产党和毛主席不断地教育了我，我逐步地了解到问题是并不像我过去所想那样的简单。我国过渡时期的总任务，是要建设一个消灭贫困、消灭剥削的幸福的社会主义社会，资本主义的生产资料私有制妨碍着我国生产力的进一步发展，资本主义经济的无政府状态同社会主义经济的有计划发展是互相对立的。我热爱我们的祖国，向往于美好的社会主义社会的前途，而我自己又是一个资本主义工商业者，这个矛盾我将怎样解决呢？我想，每个私营工商业者都会发生我的这样问题的。
    我衷心地感谢中国共产党，衷心地感谢毛主席。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们私营工商业者，找到了一条过渡到社会主义的道路，这便是国家资本主义的道路。通过国家资本主义，我们私营工商业者的个人利益和国家的利益结合了起来，我们私营工商业者不但可以进行企业改造，同时也获得了个人改造的机会，使我们能够逐步地改造思想，到将来建成社会主义社会时，能够成为一个社会主义社会的健全的公民。
    在我国第一个五年计划建设中，我们私营工商业纳入国家计划轨道后，仍然是有一定的作用。我们不能放弃我们的责任，我们要和全国人民一起，共同为完全实现国家的第一个五年计划而努力。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“工商业资本家在五年计划中的责任，就是应该服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，接受工人群众的监督，经营有利于国计民生的事业，老老实实地服从国家计划，做好国家委托的任务，接受社会主义改造。这样，他们就能够正确地发挥他们在五年计划中的应有作用，而对五年计划作出一定的贡献。”我对大会保证，我一定这样做，我们全国工商业者也一定要这样做。我们有些私营工商业者，消极悲观，一味地依赖政府安排，而放弃自己主动的积极努力，这是完全不应该、完全没有担负起自己应尽的责任的。其中更有一些人，违反宪法，进行危害公共利益，扰乱社会经济秩序，破坏国家经济计划，和用更巧妙方法重犯“五毒”等非法行为。这就是抗拒社会主义改造，必须给以法律制裁。今年以来，政府为了进一步利用限制和改造私营工商业，贯彻了
  “统筹兼顾全面安排”的方针，私营工商业的生产经营情况有了好转，大部分企业都得到了盈余。我们私营工商业者必须正确认识政府统筹安排的意义，就要诚诚恳恳、老老实实、自觉地争取进一步改造，在自己岗位上和全国人民一起加强努力，才能随着伟大祖国的前进而一起前进。
    各位代表，我们的祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在全国人民一致的努力下，正像旭日初升，正在蒸蒸日上。我们的朋友，均为我们的成就而欢欣鼓舞。但国内外敌人却在对我们加强阴谋破坏活动，企图把我国拖回到半殖民地半封建的悲惨地位。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，是给我们敲了警钟，说明美蒋反动派是在千方百计地想破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设。所以，为了保证我们极其光荣伟大的事业胜利完成，我们必须随时随地提高革命的警惕，我们必须对一切反革命活动作坚决的斗争，把一切隐蔽的反革命分子彻底肃清。
    黄家驷代表的发言
    听了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，也详细地讨论了国务院提出的第一个五年计划草案，我们认识到在一九五三年至一九五七年的五年期间，我国的国民经济将有迅速的发展。工农业总产值将由一九五二年的八百二十七点一亿元增加为一九五七年的一千二百四十九点九亿元。这个计划也体现了国民经济的改造工作。生产资料工业产值的比重上升，而消费资料工业产值的比重下降；国营、合作社营和公私合营工商业的比重上升而私营工商业的比重下降；个体生产的农业和手工业也将逐步地走向从低级到高级的合作化的生产。这些变化，说明我国的经济发展计划是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的计划，因此是符合国家在过渡时期总任务的要求的。听了李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，我们知道一九五四年国家预算的执行情况是良好的，一九五五年的预算也是符合发展国民经济计划的精神的，这就说明国务院所提出的计划是切实可行的。我完全拥护这个计划和两位副总理的报告。
    我是一个医务工作者。我知道做好人民卫生保健事业是工农业建设顺利发展的有力保证。在目前，我国的医药卫生事业的发展是落后于经济的发展和人民的需要的。在这五年内，我们要新设六所高等医学院校，全国要招收五万七千六百名新的医药专业的学生。在同一时期内，要增加医院病床十万零六千四百七十二张，疗养院床位三万九千一百五十张，门诊所六百四十一个，区卫生所四千零二十八个，工矿保健站七百四十六个。我们医务工作者一方面是无限兴奋地看到人民卫生事业的新的发展，一方面更觉得我们责任的重大。要完成这一艰巨的任务，我认为我们医务工作者必须做好下列三点：
    第一，我们必须做好中西医的团结工作。一九五七年我国医师的人数共为三十九万人，但其中中医师三十二万四千人，而受过医学院校训练的医师只有六万六千人。单依靠六万六千个医师来保障二千五百二十四万个职工和五亿多的农村人口和城市人口的健康是不可能的，但加上三十二万四千个中医师就成为一个雄厚的医学队伍。近年来，遵循着毛主席发扬祖国医学、西医学习中医的指示，有些大城市已设有中医院，不少的医院设立了中医部，更多的医院建立了中西医会诊的制度。西医学习中医的初步结果已经证明了不少的中医方法是有科学根据而且行之有效的。中西医必须进一步地团结，相互学习。祖国医学的发扬光大，也就保障了广大劳动人民的健康。
    第二，必须做好新生力量的培养工作。在这五年内，我国有二万六千六百个高等医药院校毕业生，而在一九五七年还有五万四千八百个在校学生。这是一批强大的力量。这批新生力量必须培养为德才兼备、体魄健全，既能掌握现代科学知识，又有马列主义世界观的人民卫生干部和医务人员。培养这批新生力量，固然是高等医药院校教师的责任，也是全体医务人员的责任。现在医疗预防机构的医务工作者有的不愿接受医药学生去实习，认为学生实习增加了他们的负担，或虽接受实习而认为领导实习只是医药院校教师的责任，这是不够正确的。实际上，在医疗预防机构的医务工作者，都在实际工作中积累了不少的经验，在师资非常缺乏的今天都应负起培养新一代的责任。
    第三，必须做好现有干部的提高工作。开展科学研究工作，提高现有干部的科学水平，是当前的迫切任务。“给我们时间以从事于科学研究工作”已成为科学家们一致的呼声。这个要求是正确的，也是必须的，但同时我们科学工作者亦必须进行自我改造，才能做好新时代的科学研究工作。首先，科学研究必须是为社会主义建设服务，因而科学工作者必须不断地提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平，使理论结合实际，技术结合政治，既从事于高深理论的探讨，又切合人民的需要。其次，开展科学研究工作，必须是在学习苏联的基础上进行。苏联的科学工作有坚强的思想领导与完整的组织机构，因而产生了最先进的科学技术，而且苏联的科学是社会主义类型的，苏联科学家已有三十多年为社会主义建设服务的经验，因此，苏联的科学是最符合新中国的要求的。这些道理是容易理解的，然而实行起来，就往往遇着障碍，因为对于我们一些曾经长期地接受资本主义教育的科学工作者来说，学习苏联的过程，是新旧思想斗争的过程，是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的过程。我们必须坚决地学习苏联，以苏联的科学思想、科学方法，结合我国实际情况，开展研究工作。
    同志们，摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的，但是只要我们能努力地提高自己的科学水平和政治水平，大力培养新生力量，做好中西医的大团结，我们有信心能胜利地完成第一个五年计划中医务工作者的伟大任务。
    王崑代表的发言
    我是一个歌剧演员，一个普通的音乐工作者。在听了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”以后，这几天来，我像大家一样兴奋、愉快，因为五年计划已经把一幅光辉灿烂的社会主义社会祖国的图画，在我们面前展示开来了。我们将在自己的国家里逐步地实现童话般的梦想。在童话世界里，人坐上一块毡子可以飞上天空，吹一口气可以使黄土变成黄金，有圣人出来黄河才能清。而现在我们的经济建设计划就将把这一切梦想变为现实生活了，我们的黄河水在不久的将来也就要澄清了。为了幸福、美好的生活，我们坚决拥护第一个五年计划，我们一定用我们的力量来实现五年计划。
    社会主义事业把祖国的命运和我们每一个人更加紧密地联系起来了。我们在感到幸福的同时，也深切地想到怎样为这神圣的事业贡献更多的力量。作为声乐工作者，就是要用我们的歌声去鼓舞人民的劳动热情和斗争意志。过去我们在斗争中进行过这样的演出，这些演出也曾得到人民的支持和鼓励。但是在今天，如果把工作提高到建设社会主义社会需要的水平来看，就显得我们的工作是大大地落后了。
    近几年来我们在各项基本建设工程上的伟大胜利，如鞍钢的恢复和扩建，成渝铁路和康藏公路的完成，佛子岭水库和官厅水库的建成……以及每日在全国各个角落里沸腾着的劳动生活，都还没有在音乐和歌唱中得到深刻的和生动的反映。在工业和农业生产战线上出现了好多的英雄模范人物，我们没有将他们歌唱出来，我们还没有唱出千百万劳动人民的真正的心情；因此，歌声没有流行开来，没有留传下去。解放台湾的呼声在全国人民心中激起了那样巨大的浪潮，但如果从关于这方面的不多的几首歌曲来看，和人民的激愤情绪相比较仍是非常不相称的。有不少歌唱家过份热中于“小河淌水清悠悠，哥像月亮天上走”和“大河涨水沙浪沙，一对鲤鱼一对虾”一类的爱情曲调。在我们的音乐会的节目单上，也大半是“美丽的姑娘”，“对面山上的姑娘”和“在那遥远的地方，有位好姑娘”一类的抒情歌曲。当然，这些歌曲也是我们人民所喜爱的，但不能说人民除了描写爱情的歌曲就不再喜欢有着更激动人心的反映当前建设斗争的作品，不能说人民除了“小河淌水”“大河涨水”以外就没有别的题目能够引起人们更大的兴趣。这只不过是由于某些歌唱家的艺术偏见。他们以为只有这样的爱情歌曲和某些他们认为足以表现唱歌技巧的作品才能作为声乐家的独唱节目，至于作品的主题的现实性和它所表现的思想深度以及广大群众的需要等等却很少去考虑。这就使得我们的演唱不能不单调、贫弱、脱离现实生活和脱离群众了。同时，我们的声乐家们，在事实上也还存在着没有深入群众的严重现象，歌唱家习惯在水银灯照射下，答谢观众的喝采，可是很少利用各种机会到工地、矿山、工厂、农村以及国防前线上，去为那些以紧张劳动建设社会主义和保卫祖国的人演唱。我们文学艺术工作，在毛主席文艺方向的指导下，是有着战斗的传统的，我们应该不辜负这一个伟大的社会主义建设的时代，我们应该展开新的歌咏运动，用我们的声音，来歌唱我们人民的事业，让我们劳动人民唱着歌，在建设岗位上前进。让我们的歌声真正成为我们建设和斗争生活中的愉快的声音，前进的声音，胜利的声音。
    跟随着经济建设的发展，我们的文化事业就必然繁荣起来，这就提出了我们声乐工作者提高自己的艺术修养的问题。我们要给人民唱优美的歌曲听，我们就必须重视技术锻炼，我们要与那种对自己的业务漫不经心的态度做斗争，我们要刻苦、用心、热爱自己的工作，要像梅兰芳先生那样，以自己毕生的精力，不断精益求精地提高艺术水平，使自己真正成为千百万人所熟悉所热爱的艺术家。同时，我们要非常珍爱自己民族艺术的遗产，我们应该为有这样丰富的遗产而感到幸福。要改变那些认为民间歌唱是“原始的”，“不科学的”，“落后的”的错误看法，改变那些盲目崇拜西洋资产阶级文艺的错误思想，反对以一种自己偏爱的、其实是脱离群众的唱法去代替我们生动多采的民间唱法。毛主席的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，是发展我们歌唱艺术的唯一正确的原则。
    不久以前，我国艺术团在巴黎的演出受到狂热的欢迎，我们的富有浓烈的民族色彩的京剧艺术，引起法国艺术界的震动。他们说，他们第一次接触到这样新鲜的、富有生命力的艺术。他们说，这次演出是难忘的一个辉煌胜利。这就充分说明了我国的艺术是有着很高的价值的。我们继承着这些宝贵的艺术遗产，同时面对着这伟大的建设现实和伟大的人民，又有马克思列宁主义的思想指导，我们一定可以把工作做的更好的。我想在这里提出，马克思列宁主义思想的指导，对音乐工作队伍来说，是极端重要和绝对必要的。现在阻碍我们艺术事业发展的不是别的，正是艺术队伍在思想上和组织上的不纯。这就使我们必须在我们队伍中，展开彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切反革命分子的斗争，更深
  一步地展开对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判，来加强和建设我们的文学艺术队伍。
    蓬蓬勃勃的伟大建设正在我们眼前开展。我们声乐工作者一定要努力工作，负担起斗争中的歌手的责任，用我们雄伟的战斗的歌声，来促进伟大的五年计划的完成和社会主义建设事业的彻底实现！
    卢汉代表的发言
    我听了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，彭德怀副总理兼国防部长“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”，彭真副委员长兼秘书长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我完全同意和热烈拥护。特别使我衷心激动和兴奋的是关于第一个五年计划的报告；我认为，这是我国历史上空前未有的大喜事，这是中国六亿人民的福音，这是我们走向富裕康乐道路的标志。
    从前的若干封建王朝有没有“计划”呢？有。他们所“计划”的，只是如何满足其骄奢淫逸的生活，如何巩固其世代相传的“家天下”。后来的蒋介石反动政府有没有“计划”呢？也有。他们所
  “计划”的只是如何装满其四大家族的腰包，如何出卖国家人民的利益以巴结帝国主义，他们“计划”如何榨取了人民再来屠杀人民。如果说到真正为国为民的国民经济计划，不要说不可能，连想也想不起来。代表先生们！只有今天，只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导的人民政权之下，只有在优越的人民民主制度当中，只有在苏联和其他人民民主国家无私的帮助和全国人民大力支持之下，我们才能够在第一个五年计划时期就支出了价值七万万两黄金的资金来进行这个规模宏大的国家建设。而且也才有充分的把握实现这个伟大的计划。我从这一个五年计划的内容中，看到了祖国灿烂的远景，看到了全国人民和后代子孙的幸福。
    国家第一个五年计划已经实行两年多了，在计划年度里，国家是有了显著的变化和进步的。从朝鲜停战、日内瓦会议和亚非会议取得了辉煌的胜利，我们的国际地位空前提高；经过一系列的社会改革运动和国家建设工作，人民物质与文化生活已得到改善。这一次我遵照常务委员会的指示，曾到山西省进行半个月的访问与视察，更使我得到充分的证明。同时，使我学习了很多新鲜事物，受到一次深刻的启发和教育。
    我们视察的重点，是粮食的统购统销、互助合作运动、社会治安三方面。山西在经济上是繁荣富庶的省份，政治上又是解放较早的地区，这几年来由于各级党政正确领导和人民群众的努力，在各方面都获得了成就。农村面貌是焕然一新了。统购统销问题，在山西，虽然过去曾受日寇阎匪的摧残，又受到一些自然灾害，但解放后由于农民生产积极性空前提高，农业不止是完全得到恢复并且各地都是增产的。农民对粮食统购统销政策普遍了解，热烈拥护。但是这个工作是新的，大家经验还不足，有些地区曾走了一段弯路。因为对农民的生产量和消费量摸底不够，个别干部重视统购忽视统销，口粮余粮界限不清，有偏高偏低现象，但都即时克服了这些缺点，今后有了贤明的“三定”政策，粮食工作一定会做得更好。以互助合作运动来说，山西的发展是很快的。到今年四月为止，全省已有三万一千九百二十六个农业生产合作社，入社的农户占全省总农户百分之四十以上。农民在组织起来以后，工作积极，生产增加。但农业生产合作社的工作，据我们这次选择不同的类型的社进行了访问，才知道是非常复杂和细致的，要把农业生产合作社办好是不简单的事，特别是对于评分记分、财产处理、劳动配备……等问题掌握不容易，因此有些社有不团结的现象，生产情绪受到影响。但是这些问题他们都能总结经验，即时改进了的。在治安方面，反革命的破坏活动比较严重，他们造谣，煽动，写反动标语，放毒，纵火，甚至暗杀。特点是，方法愈来愈巧妙，手段愈来愈毒辣。去冬到今春六个月中发生一百七十次暗杀干部和人民的案件，死了九十三个人。还有鼓动农民请愿要粮、破坏青苗、故意荒芜田地、火烧玉茭……种种反革命事件发生。总之，在政府未采取彻底镇压反革命措施之前，治安的情况是比较严重的。
    各位代表！现在我有三点建议，提供大会参考：
    （一）复员军人曾受到了党的培养和部队中长期的组织与纪律教育。他们政治水平是比较高的。我们看着的农业生产合作社中，有复员军人来领导的，工作就比较做得好。他们原则性强，政策能够贯彻。我认为基层干部和农业生产合作社的干部，尽可能地多任用农村中的复员军人，那是很合适的。
    （二）在小城市中有些建筑工人，他们具有一定的技术，发挥了一定的作用。但今天大部分工作是接受政府的包工。而有些机关片面的强调节约，不结合实际，降低包价。这些建筑工人又没有其他工作可做，结果不得不接受低价包工，以致影响其生活，今后似乎对这些建筑工人应该按照他们的实际生活需要规定他们的工资。
    （三）农村里的单干户一般是劳动力少或弱，田地少或不好的。有些农业生产合作社不愿吸收他们，说他们加入以后是个包袱，因此放弃领导和教育他们。单干户本身思想也不对，认为自己土地少分红不多，劳动力少“苦不赢别人”，挣钱少了不够生活。有的还说：“不自由，苦不起。”这就使百分之五十的土地和农民没有组织起来，国家计划和生产却受到影响，对农民的改造也有了阻碍。以后我们应该帮助他们搞好生产，加强对他们的教育，提早吸收他们入社。
    最后，我要求大会建议政府对反党反人民的潘汉年和胡风予以严厉惩处。我们今后更要提高警惕，肃清一切隐藏在人民内部的反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政。我坚决的拥护中国共产党和毛主席，热烈拥护全面节约的号召，为实现国家第一个五年计划，建设伟大的社会主义新中国而奋斗！
    李永代表的发言
    我完全同意并且衷心拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。
    第一个五年计划是我们祖国社会主义工业化的一个伟大的步骤。在第一个五年计划中对铁路方面的投资数字相当大，规定的任务也很繁重。在五年内要建成铁路干线、支线四千公里以上，加上恢复、改建旧有铁路和新建复线等，共达一万公里以上；铁路货运量一九五七年将为一九五二年的百分之一百八十六，货物周转量一九五七年将为一九五二年的百分之二百零一。这样的任务，在旧中国，可以说是不可想像的。但是在新中国，我们铁路工人就有充分的信心和决心来保证完成它。因为领导着我们前进的是我们伟大的共产党，是我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。有了共产党和毛主席的领导，我们就什么困难也不怕，我们就有了充分的胜利信心。过去的两年半，我们已经完成了铁路五年计划的百分之四十，在今后的两年半，我们更将以百倍的努力，保证全面完成和超额完成五年计划给我们规定的光荣任务。为了达到这个目的，我们铁路工人将从以下几个方面努力。
    一、坚决贯彻全面节约，反对一切浪费，深入开展劳动竞赛，为实现全国铁路的增产节约计划而奋斗。在一九五五年内，保证将运输成本按原计划再降低百分之一点零五，大修工程费降低百分之四，附属企业成本再降低百分之二，以节约国家宝贵的建设资金。
    二、在营业铁路上要进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，努力加速机车车辆周转，为提高货车平均净载重达到三十二点五吨，超轴牵引四千万吨，节约燃煤六万六千吨而斗争。
    三、在新建铁路和基本建设方面，更进一步开展“好、省、快、安全”的劳动竞赛，减少非生产性建筑，取消不合理的、过早的和标准过高的投资，提高设计和施工质量，缩短工期，保证如期或提前交付使用，并可较原投资总额（扣除钢轨钢梁等价值以后）降低百分之二十六点九。
    四、在劳动竞赛中，要加强劳动纪律，认真执行铁道部颁布的规章、命令、技术管理规程和技术作业过程。只有这样才能克服浪费，实现节约计划，保证质量良好、降低成本，保证安全地完成运输和基本建设任务。
    五、在劳动竞赛中要努力学习，提高技术，学习苏联先进经验，推广中长铁路的先进经验，开展合理化建议，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。
    我们清楚地知道，要完成五年计划给我们规定的任务，需要我们作很大的努力。同时我们也知道，阶级敌人对我们的任何胜利都是不甘心的。因此，我们还要进一步加强全国铁路职工的团结，不断提高阶级觉悟，随时警惕敌人的阴谋破坏，把一切暗藏的反革命分子清除出去，保证社会主义建设的顺利进行，保证第一个五年计划的胜利实现。
    张冲代表的发言
    我完全拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，愿为全部实现第一个五年计划和这些报告所提出的各项任务而努力。
    云南是多民族省份，各民族社会发展极不平衡，经济落后；又是地处祖国边疆，内外环境均较复杂，要完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务，需要更加细致稳妥地工作和进行更其艰苦复杂的斗争。过去两年，全省各族人民在中央的正确领导下，紧密团结，辛勤劳动，工农业生产均已完成了国家计划。但是我们在实际工作中还存在着许多缺点，甚至犯有错误。在农村工作方面，有些人由于对社会主义改造存有抵触思想，他们看到今年春天农村若干地区的某些粮食供应紧张情况，即认为是政府把农民的粮食购得太多，销得太少，企图修改国家的统购统销政策。事实上云南自解放以来，粮食连年增产，没有外调任务，国家所掌握的粮食，除保持一定库存以备必需外，百分之八十以上都作为统销之用。正是因为实行了统购统销政策，才稳定了市场和保证了城市、工矿区和农村缺粮户的供应。当然干部在执行政策上是有缺点的，但这绝不能作为对统购统销政策产生怀疑的根据。但是我们对于这种不正确看待农村情况的观点，缺乏从阶级斗争的实质上去分析，社会主义和资本主义的界限不够明确，曾一度在思想上发生摇摆，迁就了上述错误思想，放松了对粮食供应的掌握。这样就给奸商富农的投机套购开了方便之门，以致一度造成粮食市场的混乱，人为地加重了农村的紧张。此种错误虽已纠正，但仍是我们应该接受的重要教训。在调整商业零售的公私比重上，在某些方面也产生过无原则后退，放松了对资本主义商业的改造工作的偏向。其他方面的工作，亦存在类似的思想界限不清、摇摆不定的情况。必须改变此种情况，提高思想，加强原则坚定性，才能保证各项工作稳步前进。
    社会主义革命事业是在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中进行的。加以云南曾经是蒋介石反动派长期盘踞，企图进行最后顽抗的大陆据点之一，公开的和暗藏的反革命分子为数不少；美蒋匪帮又正在大量派遣特务间谍进来，因此革命与反革命的斗争更其激烈。但我们有不少干部，满足于改革时期以来的某些成绩，产生了骄傲情绪，在和内外敌人斗争中缺乏警惕性和力量，对公开的暴露的敌人打击很不够，对暗藏的以两面派手法活动的更为阴险的反革命分子更是麻痹大意。类似吉林省所逮捕的郑殿铭那样的反革命分子，在云南省已发现多起。和老虎在一起睡觉的情况，异常严重。一年来干部、积极分子和劳动人民有许多人被反革命分子以各种残酷手段杀害，反革命纵火案也发现了很多起，潜伏在工矿企业中的反革命分子所制造的大小破坏事故，已经查明的也有数十多起，使国家和人民财产遭受严重损失。敌人在边疆少数民族地区的破坏活动，尤为突出，公开抢劫、凶杀、制造谣言，企图挑拨民族关系，制造民族纠纷，破坏我祖国国防。反革命之所以如此猖獗，固然有其历史社会原因，但最危险的是在我们的干部和我们的周围的人中间，存在着严重的麻痹思想和各种糊涂观点。有的干部认为，几百万蒋匪军都消灭了，抗美援朝胜利了，人民的力量一天天强大了，几个残余的反革命分子无足轻重了。这种观点是十分有害的。此外，还有人认为，反革命活动是革命的压力所制造出来的。根据这种谬论，好像只要人民放下了人民民主专政的武器，反革命分子就会放下屠刀，规规矩矩了。事实恰恰相反，反革命活动之所以猖獗，正是因为我们的干部思想麻痹，放松了革命压力的原故。还有人主张对反革命分子也一律“施行仁政”，毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中，已经严厉地批判过这种错误观点。据昆明市等五个地区的调查，有相当一批反革命分子经过各种宽大处理后，仍不改悔，继续进行反革命活动，与人民为敌。足见不正确贯彻宽大与镇压相结合的政策，对反革命分子宽大无边，就是纵容反革命，严重损害人民利益。还有个别的人公然宣称：反革命分子“不畏死，奈何以死惧之”，这是站在错误立场公开为反革命辩护。这些严重的麻痹思想和糊涂观点，如不坚决纠正，就将继续纵容和助长反革命活动。给反革命分子以可乘之机。此次全国人民代表大会代表在云南视察所了解的事实，使我们更加认识到肃清一切反革命分子的必要性，只有这样才能切实有效地巩固祖国边疆，保障社会主义建设事业的安全进行。云南二十多种民族多处于不同的历史发展阶段，各有其民族特点，认真贯彻宪法所规定的“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”有其特殊的重要意义。内地各少数民族地区，已经过土改，必须帮助各族农民积极稳步地走上合作化的道路——这是彻底摆脱贫困、共同富裕的道路，也是彻底解决民族问题的道路。边疆各少数民族地区，因情况不同，未进行民主改革，几年来由于贯彻了慎重稳进和团结、生产、进步的方针，增强了民族团结，提高了各族人民的觉悟，社会情况正逐步发生变化。某些地区的少数民族人民群众以及大部分同群众有联系的公众领袖人物，日益感到封建土地制度严重阻碍着本民族的进一步发展和本民族内部的进一步团结，因此主动要求以和缓的和平协商的方式解决土地问题，并经民族自治机关和协商机关反复协商讨论，进行重点试验，证明采取这种方式是可行的；既满足人民群众的要求，又照顾到民族公众领袖人物的利益，有利于加强民族团结、发展生产和巩固国防，并为逐步过渡到社会主义社会创造条件。但是边疆情况复杂，在实行和平协商政策当中，仍应继续贯彻慎重稳进方针，进行艰苦细致的工作，严格按照政策办事。必须确实根据人民群众和民族上层领导人物的要求，千万不可勉强，并须注意防止偏差。
    至于目前尚无条件进行改革的地区，仍继续贯彻团结、生产、进步的方针。为保证边疆和内地民族地区各项任务的完成，必须认真执行宪法所规定的民族区域自治政策，保证各少数民族行使自治权利，使自治机关充分发挥作用，大力培养提拔少数民族干部，以适应工作的需要。
    毛主席在第一次会议的开幕词中指示：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”云南各族人民，必须在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，提高思想水平，克服各种缺点和错误；提高警惕，巩固国防，兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约，同全国人民一道，为实现国家第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    霍维德代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    根治黄河水害，开发黄河水利，对全国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。处在黄河中游的甘肃各族人民，渴望治理黄河的心情，一向是十分殷切的。这一愿望，只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的人民民主新时代才能实现。当一九五四年，中央人民政府组织的、由苏联专家、中国专家和有关部门的负责同志组成的黄河查勘团，到甘肃境内进行勘察的时候，他们曾经受到各族人民的热烈欢迎。现在，听了这个伟大计划的报告，我更感到无限的兴奋和愉快。
    根据根治和开发黄河的综合规划的第一期计划，在甘肃境内，将要修建刘家峡综合性工程和青铜峡干流水坝工程。这些工程完成后，甘肃的发电量，将比一九五二年增加两千八百倍，增加的农田灌溉面积，相当于一九五四年全省水地面积的百分之二十，境内的黄河通航里程将达九百多公里，并且，黄河沿岸的水患，特别是从金积县到磴口县每年的“凌汛”，将根本消除。同时随着大规模水土保持工作的开展，将从根本上逐步改变甘肃的自然面貌，使各族人民逐步摆脱旱灾的威胁，农业生产的发展获得可靠保障。所有这些，对于甘肃地区的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，对于甘肃各族人民物质和文化生活的提高，都有着极其重大的作用。我们热烈拥护这个富国利民的伟大计划，决心在中央的统一规划和领导下，努力做好有关治理黄河的各项工作，特别是做好水土保持工作，来支持和保证这一伟大计划的实现。
    甘肃绝大部分处于黄土地带，全省约有四分之三以上的山地，山岭荒秃，沟壑纵横；年雨量平均约三百公厘，最高达六百公厘，最低只有四十二公厘，多集中在七、八、九三个月，许多地方常常发生暴雨；水土流失十分严重。天水、平凉、庆阳、定西四个专区的绝大部分山地和原地已经冲刷成为丘陵沟壑。群众说：“山上和尚头，底下没水流，走路不小心，掉在沟里头。”武威、酒泉、银川等专区的部分地区，已变成半沙漠。六盘山等部分地区已变成荒瘠的石山。根据陕县文水站测量，每年从甘肃境内的泾河、渭河、祖厉河等黄河支流流入黄河的泥沙约有三亿三千万公方，其中含有氮素磷肥和钾肥一千一百多万吨，仅氮素一项，就相当于今年全省供应豆饼所含的氮素一千倍。这样严重的水土流失，是造成黄河下游经常发生水灾的一个根源，同时，也是甘肃地区土壤肥力减少，农作物产量低，并且经常发生旱灾的根本原因。据历史记载，从公元一六七一年到一九二九年，甘肃共发生一百三十九次旱灾，加之当时反动统治者的压榨，使各族人民的生命财产受到了极大的损失。严重的如一九二九年的大旱，灾民近千万，十室九空，死人很多。
    长期以来，甘肃各族人民向水土流失的现象曾经进行了顽强的斗争，也积累了不少的经验；但由于反动统治和封建土地制度的束缚以及科学技术条件的限制，不可能得到更大效果。解放以后，人民政府曾经领导和帮助群众，重点地做了一些水土保持工作。到一九五四年，全省完成田间工程二百多万亩，大小留淤工程七处，各种谷坊两万多条，蓄水堰和涝地、水窖四万多个，防洪沟一万九千多条，修“水漫地”六十四万多亩，扩大苜蓿、草木樨种植面积七十三万多亩，造林和封山育林一百三十七万亩，挖水平沟和推广垅作区田六万一千多亩。这些工作，对于局部地减轻水土流失，对于粮食增产，起了一定的作用。同时在中央水土保持工作站的指导下，天水、庆阳等地区还创办了一些比较成功的典型，取得了不少的经验。武山县邓家堡村，原来是一个贫瘠的山村，经过几年来的水土保持工作，已开始出现“地地有埂、埂埂相连、树木成林、青草遍地、泥不出沟、水不出田”的景象；粮食产量，一九五二年平均每亩一百斤，到一九五四年增加到一百六十斤。全村二十五户，在一九五二年，够吃够用的只有两户，现在已有二十二户。
    当然，这些工作，还只是一个开端，同改变自然面貌的伟大任务比较起来，还是非常渺小的。今后我们必须依照中央的根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，结合甘肃的具体情况，动员一切力量，积极地大规模地开展水土保持工作。我们初步计划：十五年内，在东部和中部地区完成四千万亩山地和原地的水土保持田间工程，在沟壑中修筑两亿六千万土方的河沟谷坊工程，并修“水漫地”二百四十万亩。在水土流失严重的坡地和山沟，种植苜蓿、草木樨等牧草五百五十万亩。在泾河、渭河、祖厉河等黄河支流和山区，营造水源林、护岸林、护坡林、防沙林和经济林九百九十万亩；并在北部的贺兰山、东部的子午岭、西部的祁连山等林区，封山育林一千万亩。这个计划实现以后，将基本上制止甘肃黄土高原上大部地区的水土流失现象，旱象可以减轻，不少荒沟干滩将会变成良田，山岭开始绿化，农业增产更加有了保障，单是中部和东部经过水土保持的四千万亩山地和原地，每亩增产以二十斤计算，每年就可以增产粮食八亿斤。各族人民的生活也可以得到重大改善。同时，泾河、渭河的中上游和祖厉河的泥沙将大大减少，对治理黄河创造了有利条件。
    水土保持工作是一项长期的、系统的改造自然的巨大工作，需要农业、林业、畜牧业和水利事业密切结合。我们要在全省范围内进行全面勘察和规划，统一地安排农业、林业和畜牧业的分布，合理地组织农业、林业、畜牧业的生产，并在总的规划之下，进行一县、一乡以至一村、一社具体实施计划，使水土保持和农业增产紧密结合，使多种经济相辅相成，防止和克服彼此之间的矛盾。根据甘肃各个地区的特点，需要抓住不同环节，采取不同的措施。例如，在庆阳、平凉等高原沟壑区，着重保原固沟，结合等高种植、深耕密植。在天水等丘陵沟壑区，着重固沟护坡，结合营造经济林。在定西等干旱区，着重防旱抗旱，修“水漫地”、挖涝池和水窖，多种秋季作物和耐旱高产作物，推广苜蓿和草木樨。在六盘山等石山区，着重防洪防涝，修梯田、蓄水、拦泥淤地，大量造林育草。在白龙江等林区，着重保护现有森林，并提倡营造经济林和种植药材。在武威、酒泉、银川等风沙区，着重固定沙丘，防沙护田，营造防护林带。
    水土保持是一项群众性的工作。进行这一工作，必然会引起群众在生产上和生活上的一系列的变化，同时，又需要广大群众的积极支持和辛勤劳动。正像有的农民说：“千万条沟要千万人去治”。因此，就需要加强对农民群众的思想教育，消除各种顾虑，使群众认识水土保持工作的重要性，懂得眼前利益和长远利益、局部利益和整体利益的一致性。同时要正确地贯彻有关各项政策。如植树造林必须贯彻“谁种谁有、伙种伙有、村种村有”的原则；土地加工，在参加农业生产合作社土地入股评产时，应有一定的照顾等。尤其重要的是，开展水土保持工作，必须同农业合作化运动密切结合起来，把改造自然同改变个体经济所有制结合起来。个体农民对保持水土虽有一定的积极性，但在分散的小农经济情况下，地块插花，利害矛盾，劳动力不足，物质条件困难，不可能在同一个汇水面积上，结合上下左右，协同进行水土保持工作，全面控制水土流失。而互助合作组织，一般成员社会主义觉悟较高，并容易接受技术改革和科学知识；在劳动力、资金和合理使用土地等方面，也有较好的条件，这就便于实现个体农民难于单独进行的种种措施。所以，只有依靠互助合作组织，才能发挥群众的集体力量，推动水土保持工作；而水土保持工作，又能丰富互助合作组织的生产内容，使个体农民更加认识到组织起来的优越性，更有利于农业的社会主义改造。
    水土保持工作是一项新的工作，这就需要重视总结和推广群众中行之有效的经验。几年来，甘肃各族人民在这方面是积累了不少经验，但我们总结和推广工作做得很不够。目前的主要问题已经不是如何试办的问题，而是如何推广经验开展工作的问题。今后需要更加重视这方面的工作，加强具体领导，教育干部，培养群众中的积极分子，传授科学技术知识，并提高警惕，严防反革命的破坏活动，使水土保持工作巩固地积极地不断向前推进。
    刘家峡综合性工程和青铜峡水坝工程，已经列入第一期计划。甘肃各族人民一定要从各方面大力支持这些工程的勘测设计和施工准备工作，并做好水库区的移民准备工作。至于其他水库区需要移到甘肃的人民，我们热烈欢迎，并在生产和生活上给他们以必要的帮助。
    各位代表，未来的美丽的黄河远景已经展开在我们面前，几千年来多少人梦寐以求的理想，就要在我们这一代人的手里实现。正如毛主席所说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的
  事业。”我们为了国家的社会主义前途，为了我们子孙万代的幸福，一定要在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在伟大的盟邦苏联的帮助下，积极地动员起来，为早日实现根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利这一伟大任务而奋斗！
    耿长锁代表的发言
    听了各位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告和发言以后，我有说不出来的高兴，从心眼里诚心拥护。
    这次会议所讨论的我国的第一个五年计划，是为我国社会主义工业化打初步基础。着重发展重工业，我完全拥护。只有这样，才能巩固国防，解放台湾，打击帝国主义的侵略，保卫住咱们幸福的生活；才能供应给农民拖拉机和各种新式农具，使我国的农业逐渐走向集体化和机械化。
    各位首长说的对，发展工业是重点，同时也要发展农业，发展农业也是很重要的。在国家建设中，我们全国农民所担负的任务是很重大的，也是极为光荣的。第一个五年计划里所规定的发展农业的计划，我们一定要努力完成，还要争取超过。
    我是河北省饶阳县五公乡农业生产合作社的社长。五公乡是全乡合作化了的，饶阳县现在也已合作化了。全县百分之八十四的农户都入了社。共产党、毛主席所指示的农业互助合作的道路，是我们农民永远摆脱贫困的道路，是我们农民步步登高走向共同富裕的道路。拿五公乡合作社来说，从一九四三年成立时，仅有四户的“土地合作组”，现在已发展到四百一十九户的大社了。十年前，我们没有犁耙，只好用大镐刨地；现在不但有一套新式马拉农具、二十张七吋步犁、三十三辆大车、一百零三头牲口，而且国家还在我乡建立了拖拉机站，百分之四十以上的土地都已机耕。过去全乡只有十几辆水车，现在有了六十八辆水车，还有两眼机井。
    常说组织起来力量大，合作社的好处是很多的。五公乡的土质和其他自然条件都不很好，过去每亩顶多打二百斤粮食的土地，现在能收到四百多斤粮食了，增加了一倍多。去年秋收的时候，谷子熟了，整天下雨，眼看着谷子要坏在地里，我们发动了全社“千人大抢收”运动；大家冒着雨抢收了四百四十八亩谷子，减少损失一万多斤。合作社比单干户容易接受科学技术。棉花过去每亩只有一千五百棵，去年我们社三百七十六亩棉花都密植到两千五百棵以上。全社的谷子，全都采用了“手提苗”。去年虽然有灾，秋收作物平均每亩产量仍达到三百五十九斤原粮（棉花一斤籽棉折三斤原粮），比一九五三年提高百分之十二点九。除交公粮外，卖给国家统购粮八万七千七百斤，比一九五三年增加三万五千多斤；还卖给国家四万六千斤棉花，十二万斤花生。每个劳动日分了七斤原粮，比前年增加了百分之十七。去年每个劳动力平均得到一千六百二十二斤原粮。今年一千二百多亩小麦，全都作到了窄垅密植，比去年增产百分之六点三。我们社种植各种庄稼都是按照国家的种植计划去作的，每年都能超额完成指标。合作社不但能提高生产，服从国家种植计划，而且能够使大家共同富裕。我们社有四十五户孤、寡、老弱户，除去完全失去劳动力的以外，都参加了生产。去年有二十户都得到六十个以上的劳动日，其中有十八户还卖给国家余粮四千多斤。随着生产的发展，我们的物质文化生活也改善了。现在我们社里有医药社、妇幼保健站、常年民校、图书馆、收音站，还有业余剧团。
    在共产党的正确领导和人民政府的支持下，我们五公乡农业生产合作社虽然有很大成绩，但是在政治思想工作上和经营管理上都还有缺点。这些缺点，正在努力纠正。
    五公乡农业生产合作社今年的增产计划，比去年要多收粮食两万三千斤，多收棉花五万三千斤，多收花生六万斤。比去年产量提高百分之二十二点
  一四。我们要把更多的粮食和工业原料贡献给国家，支持国家的社会主义工业化，支援解放台湾。
    去年开会的时候，毛主席教导我们：应当努力工作，努力学习苏联，老老实实、勤勤恳恳、互勉互助、不要骄傲。我一定记住毛主席的话，作好工作，努力生产，更密切地团结群众，和大家共同努力完成并且超额完成我国第一个五年计划。
    孙德和代表的发言
    国务院几位副总理在大会上所作的报告与发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，我都完全同意，并且愿以最大的热情来拥护。也希望全国的科学技术工作者同全国人民紧密地在一起为实现与超额完成五年计划努力奋斗。
    我是一个从旧社会里生长的从事于钢铁冶炼工作的技术人员，与不少的其他的技术人员一样，在以往也曾有过搞好工业使广大的人民能过好生活的一些幼稚而单纯的想法，也希望从而能抵抗帝国主义的侵略。解放以后，我才真正认识到在那万恶的旧社会的统治之下，这完全是幻想。
    从钢铁工业以往的一些事实来与今天对比便很显然。汉阳钢铁厂的建立与消灭，留给我们的只是一个悲痛的历史回忆。欧战时建起来的石景山钢铁厂不能开工，反动政府时代叫了很久要建立的钢铁厂没有一个实现而且规模也很小，以往搞钢铁工业必须全部依赖帝国主义的少数垄断资本家和他们的设计机构，他们当然只为他们自己与反动政权着想，而不可能是为中国人民打算的。
    今天，五年计划里规定了发展巨大的钢铁工业，将要建立好几个钢铁基地，它们的规模是世界上头等的钢铁联合企业；经过了详细调查研究，采用的是世界上最新技术的成就；选用了最大的，效率最高的，也是最经济的设备；操作是机械化、自动化的；更保证了资源的最有利的利用。为什么会有这样鲜明的对照呢？事实上，毛主席所讲的“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”早就说明了这个问题。另外，苏联是以国际主义的精神诚恳无私的帮助我国实行社会主义工业化的，而帝国主义是不希望我国工业化的。
    从十九世纪中到现在，资本主义国家钢的生产的增长大约是需二十五年增长一倍，而我们五年之间增长为三点零六倍，约相当于他们的三十八年的时间，我们增长的速度约等于他们平均增长的七倍半。资本主义世界的生铁总产量，一九五○年约只等于一九一八年的一点六倍（其间一九三二年倒退只等于一九一八年的二分之一），我们则在五年内增长为二点四六倍。我们的增长速度从形势上看以后还会加速提高，这确是伟大的奇迹。为这些伟大的事迹所激动，我们怎能不欢欣鼓舞，怎能不为这些光辉、灿烂的事迹欢呼，怎能不为我们优越的社会制度与伟大的领导而歌颂。
    五年计划不但大大发展钢铁、金属工业，对于机械工业也有同样的巨大投资，我们将要有重型机厂与一系列的机械工厂，有了这些工厂我们就能自制更多的重工业的重大的装备，就能够创建更多的工业基地与相关的各类重要工业。我更深刻地体会到革命导师斯大林同志所讲的话：“金属是一切工业基础的基础”与机械工业是工业的心脏的意义。我们将能更好地发展工业，巩固国防力量，保卫世界和平事业。
    更使我兴奋的是我们有了根治和开发黄河的计划。中国人民就要亲眼看到，几千年来威胁中国人民生活与安全的凶猛的黄河就要受到驯服，它的巨大的力量将要遵循人民的意图为灌溉、为航运、为发电而服务。我们每个人内心里都充满无限的喜悦，我们很难用言语说出内心的情感。这工程规划计划简直是像一篇美丽的诗，这焉能不震动每一个人的心，焉能不震动整个世界。
    自然，在我国长期科学落后与人才不足的情况下，要在短期内完成这些重大的建设是不会没有困难的。
  但是我们有中国共产党的坚强的领导，有英明的毛主席。我们还有以苏联为首的兄弟国家及他们的专家们的国际主义的无私的技术与物质的支援，我有完全的信心，一定能克服一切困难完成五年计划。
  苏联专家帮助我们恢复，帮助我们建设，另外还在工作中培育了大量的技术人员。在专家的教导下，几年来我国黑色冶金工厂设计的力量有了很大的增长。一九五三年初，只有从各方面调来的不多的人数，而且可以说，那时大家都不知道怎样作设计工作，在两年多的时间里，通过专家的教导及工作的实践，设计力量与能力都有了相当的提高，也完成了一定的工作任务。已经完成了相当大量的施工图纸工作，在建设里起了一定的作用。在专家的指导下，目前设计单位正在培养能力进行一般钢铁厂与矿山的扩建或其中的各别车间设计。但是必须说明，从建立制度、取得设计资料以及提高水平各方面都是同专家的指导，与苏联的支援分不开的。对于苏联伟大无私的帮助，我们是衷心感激的。
    但是设计工作是复杂与困难的工作，设计人员的技术水平还很差，与形势发展的需要还有相当大的距离。在过去的工作里有很多的错误与严重的缺点。例如设计常有变更，图纸有错误，常常要修改，因而造成施工的误期、窝工返工与积压器材等浪费情况，造成很大的损失。今后，必须严格检查，纠正错误，接受经验教训，贯彻厉行节约、反对浪费的斗争。
    在学习方面，设计人员不但要保证刻苦地向专家学习技术，学习苏联先进科学，更要学习他们的思想与工作方法及作风。我们深深感觉到，必须大力加强马克思列宁主义与辩证唯物主义的思想方法的学习，批判唯心主义的残存概念，提高警惕，大大地提高设计人员的政治与思想水平，才能克服许多本位主义、自由主义、主观主义的错误，才能发挥社会主义设计思想，才能贯彻整体观念、经济核算制，提高劳动生产率，作到设计产品确实是先进技术的传播，真能代表政治、经济与技术的结合。除去扩建的设计以外，设计单位还须培养为建设新的巨大的、复杂的钢铁联合企业的设计能力，并同科学研究、基本建设、生产单位密切协作，为我国今后的建设提供更多的金属材料与特殊材料。
    只有通过长期的勤勤恳恳的努力学习与工作，接受批评，纠正缺点，我们才能够保证在建设社会主义社会的几个五年计划里，完成设计工作者应该承担的光荣任务，我们才真正作到以实际的行动拥护五年计划，感谢中国共产党和毛主席的领导。
    陈永康代表的发言
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，并拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告以及李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。听了彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告及彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我完全同意。
    我国经过三年国民经济恢复以后，到一九五三年即进入计划经济建设时期，社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节是优先发展重工业。在过渡时期总任务原则指导下，我国第一个五年计划草案支出总数七百六十六亿四千万元，其中基本建设投资四百二十七亿四千万元，分配工业部门的基本建设投资为二百四十八亿五千万元，占基本建设投资的百分之五十八点二，其他各部门占百分之四十一点八。计划草案作这样的分配，是依据优先发展重工业的科学法则的。只有这样科学的部署，才能保证在我国建立起强大的重工业，使我们能够自己制造现代化的工业设备，来在技术上改造我们的工业、农业和交通运输业，来巩固我国国防，来不断增加农业品和消费品的生产，提高人民物质文化生活。这些计划是完全正确的，是符合我国各族人民的长远利益和眼前利益的。
    这个计划是照顾到全国范围的，它力求改变旧中国工业偏在沿海各省的不合理状态，在全国各地适当地分布工业的生产力。因此除在华北、西北、华中等地积极进行新的工业基地的建设外，也在西南已开始部分的工业建设。因此我们可以预见到，像我们贵州这样比较落后的地区，也将会一步一步地走上工业化的先进道路，分布在贵州地区的许多少数民族也将要从千百年来经济落后的困苦中解放出来。我们也看到这个计划是对全国范围作了精密的通盘筹划制定的，各地区的工业建设的进行，是按照具体的必要和可能的条件，有着轻重缓急的分别。有些地区应该立刻进行大规模的建设，有些地区须要稍缓一步。经过讨论五年计划草案和听报告以后，我在思想上又进一步明确认识到工业建设必须有中心，必须在重点方面集中使用力量，而不能到处一样地平均使用力量。我是在地方工作的人，应该经常加强全局观点，才能避免认识上的偏差。回忆我过去的想法，是与优先发展重工业的原则有些距离的。假如过份从地方着想或过份地强调地方，而不考虑到全国各地轻重缓急互相配合，那就使工业化的速度会慢起来。这不但对全国的工业没有好处，而且归根结底对地方也没有好处。五年计划发展工业的部署，既合于全国社会主义建设的利益，也符合贵州省各族人民的利益。
    在增产节约积累资金建设重工业的同时，相应地发展农业等建设事业，这完全是正确的。就发展农业的需要来说，我认为我们的计划草案所规定的农业、林业、水利的投资数目是不算少的；何况正如报告所说，这些投资再加上农民自己用于扩大再生产的投资，就很够满足农民的需要了。在目前工业还很落后而农业也还只是在初步走向合作化的情况下，如果对农业方面进行太多的投资，不但会影响到工业建设所要的资金的集中，而且对农业来说，也不见得就能发挥投资应有的作用。我认为计划草案对农业的投资是正确的，是能完成增产任务的。
    从五年计划的精神来看，我们贵州少数民族地区应以发展互助合作农业增产运动为中心，来贯彻五年计划关于农业增产的任务，多增产粮食与其他技术作物来支援国家工业化，为一百五十六项中心建设以及其他工业建设和巩固国防服务。因而，走互助合作道路就成为贵州省少数民族由落后到先进的基本环节。
    我们要依靠中国共产党、毛主席的正确领导，防止建设中的浪费行为，必须与浪费作坚决的斗争，以便使我们的国家的资财，能够在发展生产方面发挥充分的作用。为着防止浪费，我们非常拥护我们计划规定的尽量降低非生产建设标准的原则。在这方面，过去在我们的工作中是有严重的浪费的，这说明我们以前对于用厉行节约的方法来积累社会主义的建设资金的原则，认识还是不足的，必须坚决纠正。
    总的说来，要实现五年计划，必须大力贯彻中央的厉行节约，反对浪费的指示，要发扬艰苦奋斗、具体深入的工作作风，在量入为出的基础上尽量节约不必要的开支，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    孙作宾代表的发言
    我完全同意我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和大会的几个报告。第一个五年计划是从根本上改变我国经济面貌的一个具有历史意义的计划。我们必须加强学习，勤勤恳恳作好自己担负的工作，为实现这个伟大的计划而努力奋斗。
    青海是一个地广人稀，工业基础很薄弱的地区。全省面积约八十二万平方公里，仅有人口一百七十余万。由于长江、黄河均发源于青海境内，土壤肥沃，水草丰美，农牧业潜在力和发展前途很大。据我们初步勘察，仅柴达木盆地就有可垦荒地约三千万亩，并有广阔的天然草原可增放牲畜约一千万头，但目前这个地区百分之九十五以上并无人居住。在长江、黄河上游地区，水草茂盛，真是所谓“风吹草低见牛羊”。
    几年来，我们依据这样有广阔发展前途的优美的天然环境，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，由于各族人民的团结努力，在农业和畜牧业生产方面，已取得显著的成绩。截至一九五四年，粮食产量已达到全省能够自给，改变了多年来粮食不能自给的情况；大、小牲畜发展到一千二百余万头，较一九四九年增长一倍多。我们相信，随着第一个五年计划的实现，农业和畜牧业生产将获得更大的发展。计划至一九五七年，组织起来的农户将达总农户百分之八十五，其中参加农业生产合作社的农户将达总农户的百分之四十八；扩大灌溉面积五十余万亩；开垦荒地四十余万亩；粮食增产量较一九五二年提高百分之三十六；大、小牲畜增加到一千八百余万头。牧区的贫苦牧民约占总户数的百分之二十，解放以来，我们曾用贷款救济的办法，积极扶助他们解决生产和生活上的困难，有些人现已建立起家务，生产和生活上的困难基本上得到解决，今后对于还有困难的牧民，要继续贷款救济，帮助他们解决困难。
    青海省工业虽很薄弱，但地下矿藏非常丰富，工业发展前途同样是很大的。根据初步勘察了解，青海地区的地下资源如石油、煤及稀有金属等都有大量蕴藏。对于这些地下资源，国家已在开始进行大规模的勘探工作。我们相信，随着国家工业、特别是重工业的发展，不久将会在青海草原上竖起工厂的烟囱，冒起烟来。
    开发柴达木盆地，是与发展我国国民经济和青海省各族人民利益直接相关的重大问题。因此，我们已将支援开发柴达木盆地的勘探工作，列为一九五五年主要任务之一。各级干部和各族人民都为国家着手开发柴达木盆地而感到兴奋，在支援工作上表现非常积极和热情。
    青海是一个多民族地区，解放以来，大力推行了民族区域自治，广泛地团结了各民族中同人民群众有联系的公众领袖，积极调解了民族之间和民族内部的纠纷，从而使民族团结日趋巩固。但由于历史上遗留的民族隔阂尚未完全消除，因而暗藏的反革命分子和反动地主、富农，还在千方百计地找寻空隙，破坏民族团结。这些敌人进行破坏的方法是很阴险毒辣的，主要的是披上宗教外衣或利用民族关系。暗藏的反革命分子还以放火、抢劫、造谣等办法破坏我们的生产，甚至组织公开武装进行叛乱。反动地主、富农也以挑拨中农和贫农关系、混入互助组和合作社等办法，积极破坏互助合作运动。敌人这些破坏活动，对于我们的教训是严重的。这充分证明：革命事业愈前进、愈胜利，敌人的破坏活动就必然愈凶恶、愈毒辣。因此，为了胜利地实现第一个五年计划，我们必须加强团结，提高警惕，坚决镇压一切反革命分子，反对任何麻痹思想，注意在工作中堵塞一切可能为反革命分子利用的漏洞。
    为了胜利地完成第一个五年计划，我们还必须积极响应中共中央和国务院关于反对浪费厉行节约的号召。我们青海省的摊子虽小，但所存在的浪费现象仍是严重的。如在修建西宁宾馆中的浪费竟达全部工程费的百分之二十，一些机关、学校、工厂、矿山曾发生虚报人口，浪费粮食的现象，在其他方面的浪费也是很不少的。有些国家机关工作人员尚不很懂得生活现代化应该先要有工业现代化的基础的这一道理，因而存在着过早的要求生活现代化的思想。另外，由于我们向各族人民广泛地进行关于增产节约的宣传教育工作做得不够，因而在一部分人民群众中也存在着一些浪费现象。这些都是不利于我们第一个五年建设计划的实现的，在今后工作中我们必须大力克服和防止。协饶登珠代表的
  发言
    我在这次会议上听了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，阅读了第一个五年计划草案及其他有关文件，并经过研究讨论，学习了很多东西，提高了认识，更加增强了建设社会主义的信心。我衷心拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划及其他有关文件，并完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。
    第一个五年计划，是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个重要步骤。它的提出，给全国人民在实现过渡时期总任务的道路上指出了更具体的奋斗目标和更明确的前进方向。因此，将得到各族人民的热烈拥护和积极支持。
    第一个五年计划以发展重工业为中心，这是完全正确的。因为只有发展了重工业，才能为我国建立起社会主义的强大的物质基础，使我们的国家富强和人民幸福；也只有发展了重工业，国家才能更有力地帮助少数民族发展各项建设事业，改变我国各民族在经济上的落后状态。所以，集中主要力量发展重工业，是符合我国各族人民的长远利益和最高利益的；而第一个五年计划的编成，也正是我国各族人民共同利益的体现。
    今年三月国务院全体会议第七次会议通过的“关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定”中规定在拉萨、日喀则等地分别建立水力、火力发电站和皮革厂、小型铁工厂、修筑河堤水坝、修筑公路等项目，也已分别包括在第一个五年计划之中。因此，西藏人民不但要继续积极支援和协助进藏人民解放军和工作人员，主动搞好团结，做好工作，而且应当积极努力参加各项建设事业。我们懂得，支援和协助进藏人民解放军和工作人员，做好西藏地区当前各项工作和国务院决定帮助西藏地方进行的各个建设项目，就是配合了国家的整个建设计划，同时也就是为进一步建设西藏奠立基础。所以，西藏人民和全国各族人民的利益是完全一致的。
    西藏和平解放后，进藏人民解放军和工作人员坚持执行了毛主席的民族政策、宗教政策和和平解放西藏办法的协议，认真地尊重民族平等权利、宗教信仰和风俗习惯，并在非常困难的条件下，尽力帮助藏族人民发展生产建设，逐步改善物质和文化生活状况。西藏人民在毛主席的伟大民族政策和进藏人员这种实际行动的感召下，也踊跃地进行了支援运输、采购、修路等工作。藏汉两族人民几年来通过各种实际活动，逐步发展了友爱合作的新的关系；藏汉两族干部也在工作和学习中建立了互相尊重、互相商量、互相学习、互相帮助的良好关系。各民族之间的团结，是建设祖国的重要条件；而藏汉两族人民和干部之间的团结，则是建设西藏的必不可少的更重要的条件。因此，今后还必须继续加强和巩固我国各民族之间和藏汉民族之间以及西藏内部的团结，进一步发展藏汉两族干部之间的互相尊重、互相学习的友好关系，为建设祖国、建设西藏而努力。
    要完成我国第一个五年计划，必须认真培养各种建设干部；而要逐步发展西藏地区的建设事业，更必须大力培养当地的民族干部。几年来，西藏地区培养民族干部的工作是有很大成绩的。除过先后选送数百名藏族男女青年到内地学习外，并在当地通过各种实际工作和社会活动，注意了培养民族干部的工作，提高了他们的爱国主义觉悟和实际工作的业务水平。从西藏当前工作的需要及其建设的发展来看，民族干部的培养工作今后仍须加强，并应把它放在经常的更重要的地位上加以安排，以便进一步从各方面加强这一工作。
    建设西藏，是一项长期的艰巨的工作任务。我们坚决地相信，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，在汉族及其他兄弟民族人民的帮助和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的直接领导以及西藏僧俗人民的亲密团结、一致努力下，我们一定能够配合着祖国的建设计划，圆满地完成建设西藏的任务。
    西藏人民将和全国各兄弟民族人民一道，尽一切力量为完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    王震代表的发言
    我热烈地拥护李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。我完全同意铁道部滕代远部长关于降低铁路造价措施的发言，并愿在铁道兵部队所担负的新线工程施工中贯彻执行。
    中国人民解放军铁道兵在修建黎塘至湛江和鹰潭至厦门铁路的施工中，得到当地党、政领导机关和人民群众热烈支援，使黎（塘）湛（江）铁路比原订计划提前半年于本年七月一日全线通车了。鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路现在正集中力量在全线展开施工。这些铁路的建筑，由于取得了苏联专家的帮助，施工部队能更实际地学习苏联的勘测设计与施工的先进经验。在建筑郁江大桥时，学会了使用气压沉箱施工，学会了各种架桥法，学会了使用风钻开挖隧道导坑等作业法，并能迅速地学会掌握各种机械机具的操作法，人工铺轨的速度从每天二·五公里提高到每天六·六公里。
    在许多桥墩基础的建筑中，经常遇到暴雨山洪的袭击，战士们奋不顾身地抢救，保护了建筑物的安全和稳固，出现了许多集体立功的单位，其中有著名的抢险英雄叶传文、张家方、罗柑辉等同志。
    在施工中，经常遇到暴雨、山洪、台风、炎热和寒冷等等的侵袭。要御防和对抗不良气候的袭击，这就要求有指导施工的周详计划和坚强斗争的意志。
    热爱社会主义的财产的责任感和创造性的劳动，也是动人的。有一回，一只帆船满载着钢轨从广州到湛江去，在海上突然遇到了风暴，船被浪涛冲歪了，有五十一根钢轨掉进了海里。这里的海水就是退潮的时候也有四十公尺深，海底的泥沙还有三至四公尺深，打捞是很困难的。潜水班长王全福和三位潜水员，自告奋勇地担负了这个工作。他们潜入海底去，身上受到巨大的气压，工作十分困难，而且还有鲨鱼袭击的危险。但是，他们把祖国的财产，看得比自己的生命还重要，他们为了打捞钢轨，连续工作了一个月，他们租船和购买绳索只用了八百元，把价值约两万元的五十一根钢轨从海里全部打捞起来了。
    在我们建筑铁路的过程中，我们依靠着当地党、政的积极领导，发动了人民群众参加筑路。同时，我们也看到反革命分子在我们开始布置施工时乘机活动起来，散发油印报纸、标语、传单、打黑枪、烧仓库，以及企图利用封建迷信进行破坏。譬如，在迁移一座坟墓的时候，反革命分子暗中挑拨群众要四十元买棺材，结果是由当地农民群众检举了反革命分子，破获了反革命组织。农民积极拥护社会主义建设，自动提出迁移坟墓，按劳动人民传统习惯用瓦罐盛骨骸，每一座坟墓只须国家付出四元到八元钱就够了。
    参加筑路的民工，都是有组织的男女青年壮丁，两广的妇女与男子一样劳动，他们同中国人民解放军团结得像一家人一样。国家修筑铁路不但使人民看到了经济文化发展的前途，而且能推动农业生产合作社的发展。民工队回家时，都说学会了集体劳动的组织方法。都说“组织起来力量大，劳动效率高。”这些都体现了我们国家人民民主制度的优越性。
    我完全拥护“增加生产”、“厉行节约”的号召。自从中国共产党全国代表会议后，人民日报陆续揭露了基本建设方面的浪费现象，提出厉行节约的具体措施，特别是周恩来总理在军队干部会上的讲话，李富春副总理关于节约问题的报告，以及滕代远部长视察西南和西北新线建设后，向国务院所做的报告，经过传达和学习后，大大地提高了施工部队全体人员对于“增产节约”降低铁路造价的积极性。大家都开动了脑筋，检查和批评了自己工作中的浪费现象，能够提出节约的合理化建议。从鹰（潭）厦（门）线设计总则的预算可以看出：原来平均每公里造价为八十二万九千元。但是经过设计、施工、基本建设各单位协同进行沿线踏勘，并在谢尔巴可夫专家指导下，广泛地实行民主讨论，批判了盲目地增大安全系数和追求高标准的设计思想，提出了符合该线运量和山岳困难地段的条件，变更不适当的设计标准，经铁道部鉴定批准后，又在专家帮助下，研究了改善施工方法，节约工料，提高工率，压缩间接费用，现在的预算每公里降为六十七万七千五百元。鹰厦铁路虽然通过大山区，河流多，雨量多（五年记录平均每年完全晴天只五十多天）等困难条件，但我们将在此次全国人民代表大会会议后，继续深入精打细算，发挥集体智慧，保证工期，保证工程质量，要求从施工方面再降低一些造价，还是可能的。比如说，要减少非生产性的投资上，就有这样一个例子，勘测设计、基本建设和施工方面的各机关，要进到鹰潭—厦门线工地进行工作，即需要三万多平方公尺的房屋，原先准备建造二万六千多平方公尺的房子，但是在福建省叶飞省长亲自指导下，在一个不大的市镇就腾出了三万多平方公尺的房屋以及大部家具。这些房屋和家具都是当地党、政府、军队腾出来的。我们就把修建这笔临时房屋的钱节省下来了。去年我们接受黎湛线的施工任务时，国防部长彭德怀指示：“你们司令部搬到工地去，铁道兵应当把工地当教练场，当干部学校，自己不懂，就到工地去见学！”经验证明这个指示是完全正确的。铁道兵在修建铁路中是应该能够做到“好、省、快”的。因为这是有许多好条件的。从人民解放战争以来就成立了铁道兵部队，全国铁路上有一批优秀工程师和熟练工人参加了铁道兵，以后又不断地有高等学校的毕业生补充进来，特别是有苏联专家作技术上的指导。这是我们能够做到“好”的条件；铁道兵部队到达工地，不但得到人民的热烈的拥护，而且得到各地驻军领导机关的直接支援，举凡供给、卫生保证等，都不要临时筹措，这是使我们能够做到“省”的条件；军队的组织性、纪律性强，政治觉悟高，调到工地整师整团分散开来就如同战斗一样，可以迅速展开施工，这是我们能够做到“快”的条件。我们在施工中还存在着许多缺点，还有许多浪费现象，须要努力克服。因此，只要我们勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，力戒骄傲自满，努力学习，并认真地确立经济核算思想和健全经济核算制，我们就有可能在和平建设中成为建筑铁路的突击队，从而学会本领；在解放台湾的斗争中，在假如一旦帝国主义敢于侵犯我们神圣的祖国时，我们也就能够保障铁道畅通，以支援英雄的战斗军种、兵种的胜利。而在当前则努力争取鹰厦线提前修成。
    我完全拥护我们国家的兵役法和彭德怀副总理兼国防部长的报告。青年人应征入伍受了现代化的军事训练后，也是很好的工农业的劳动者。而现代化的工农业的劳动者，又是现代化国防军的很好的士兵。这正如刘伯承代表所指出的实行义务兵役制后就广阔地展开了“寓兵于工”、“寓兵于农”、“寓兵于学”的兵多将广的国防潜力。这样，我们就可以减少常备官兵，可以节省出更多的经费来建设工业。因此，兵役法是同我们国家的伟大的社会主义建设完全一致的。
    李川江代表的发言
    我是一个榨油工人，我参加这次大会，听了四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，阅读和讨论了关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案，我心里感到十分高兴和愉快。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们中国将要建设成为一个工业发达、繁荣富强的社会主义国家，连黄河的水也要变清了，这完全符合我们全国人民的意志和希望。所以对于这些报告和五年计划草案，我完全同意和热烈拥护。
    李富春副总理在报告中提出：社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是优先发展重工业。这是完全正确的。我现在认识到，优先发展重工业的政策，是使国家富强和人民幸福的最好办法。如我国油厂中土榨油坊很多，少数机榨工厂的设备也多是技术落后的，只有国家的重工业发达了，能大批制造各种新机器，油脂工业才能从根上改变技术落后的情况。
    经过这次五年计划草案的阅读和讨论，我更深一步认识到我们油脂职工任务的重大。我过去认为油脂缺乏不够用，农民弟兄多种点油料作物就行了。现在认识到全国人民每人平均才二亩多地，要靠它吃粮食、穿衣服、还要多种国家需要的其他工业原料，所以光靠多种油料作物是不行的，还需要大力挖掘油脂工业的生产潜力。我国油脂工业绝大部分是设备陈旧、技术落后，这种情况说明，生产潜力也还很大。如果我们能够认真钻研技术，及时推广先进经验，就一定能够多增产油脂。比如我们地方国营四平油酒厂，设备很陈旧，厂房是经过打仗烧毁以后恢复起来的。一九四九年出油率每百斤大豆只出九斤左右，由于党和行政的正确领导和支持，在工会的教育下，全体职工积极努力钻研技术，认真推广了先进经验，一九五○年出油率达到十一斤左右，以后出油率逐年上升，现在出油率是十四斤左右，我们还有把握把它进一步继续提高。
    四平油酒厂几年来的经验和成绩是同共产党、毛主席和政府的领导，是同全国兄弟厂的支援分不开的。特别是去年十一月初中央召开了全国油脂生产会议，会议提出了在一九五四年固定原料的基础上，一九五五年全国油脂工业为国家增产十万吨油脂的光荣任务；会议还总结和交流了全国兄弟厂的先进榨油经验，号召展开以推广先进榨油经验、提高产油率为中心内容的油脂增产运动。四平油酒厂担当的增产任务是四万四千八百斤，经过全体职工努力，今年上半年已超额百分之零点三完成了半年增产任务。四平油酒厂能够超额完成上半年增产任务，主要是因为认真学习和推广了兄弟厂的先进经验，如洮南“单圈薄饼”，和旅大“无草饼圈”等先进经验。有了全国兄弟厂的先进榨油经验，我们就有信心能一定保证完成和争取超额完成增产任务。四平油酒厂的工作也还存在很多缺点，有的工人自骄自傲，有的工人不认真执行操作方法，给国家造成很大损失。我认识自骄自傲就是一种落后的道路，我回厂后一定和全厂职工一起，克服这些缺点，认真执行操作方法，积极学习先进经验。
    去年第一次全国油脂会议后，中央各有关部门颁发了关于油料加工办法的协议。这个协议初步贯彻的结果，有力地推动与提高了企业经营管理与职工生产的积极性，开始扭转了片面追求压榨量、忽视提高出油率的偏向。但是有些地区到现在还没有认真贯彻这个协议。我们油脂职工应在党的领导下，切实监督油料加工办法贯彻实行。
    榨油工业是繁重的体力劳动。解放以来，因为领导重视，有不少油厂花钱不多，甚至不花什么钱，就使劳动条件有了很大改善。但有些地方和油厂的领导同志不重视这个问题，所以有一些油厂还存在着劳动时间过长或车间温度过高，影响了工人的健康和生产的积极性，这应引起有关部门加以注意。
    我们油脂工人保证和全国工人阶级和全国人民
  一道，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，为完成我国第
  一个伟大的五年计划，尽我们最大的力量。四平油酒厂的职工已经向全国油脂兄弟厂发起了友谊竞赛，到我来开会的时候，已经收到了一百左右个兄弟厂的应战书。积极开展油脂增产运动，这就是我们油脂工人热烈拥护第一个五年计划的实际行动。我们要继续认真地贯彻去年全国油脂会议的精神，切实推广大豆、花生、棉籽、菜籽及其他各项榨油的先进经验，提高生产技术，充分发挥现有设备潜在能力，保证在固定油料的基础上，超额完成增产十万吨的光荣任务。在这里，我们要感谢农民弟兄们的支援，我们要完成增产十万吨食油的光荣任务，必须依靠农民弟兄们把含油率高的好粮食卖给国家。我们还要继续大力利用各样代用油料，为国家增辟油源。
    为了保证完成第一个五年计划，我们还必须提高政治警惕，参加肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，以保卫我们的胜利果实。
    康克清代表的发言
    我衷心地拥护关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理及彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。第一个五年计划明确指出：社会主义工业化的中心环节是优先发展重工业，这是完全正确的。因为只有建立起强大的重工业，才能使国家富强，才有可能从根本上保证人民生活水平的不断提高，使广大人民和后世子孙永远摆脱贫困，得到普遍富裕的生活。在这里，我仅就五年计划中关于儿童保育和教养问题发表一点意见。五年计划中规定：“稳步地发展保育事业。”并指出“五年内，应该根据可能的条件，适当地发展幼儿园，在城市中可由机关团体、企业单位和群众自行举办，在农村中提倡农业生产合作社举办。”这一方针是完全正确的。这既可使国家集中资金进行重点建设，又可充分运用和发挥社会上各方面的人力、物力来逐步推广儿童保育事业，是完全有利于社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的。
    我们知道随着社会主义建设事业的发展，在城市和农村参加各种生产建设的妇女日益增多，要求解决孩子的教养问题也就越来越迫切。如果孩子的教养问题得不到适当解决，就会影响到父母的生产情绪和工作情绪。所以，做好儿童保育工作，就能使父母积极生产、积极工作，成为保证五年计划胜利完成的一个条件。因此我们完全赞成由机关团体、企业单位、生产组织和群众自行举办多种多样的日间托儿所、托儿站、变工互助和个别寄托等托儿办法。一方面可以更多地为参加生产、工作而家中无人照顾孩子的妇女解决问题，另一方面也能使孩子得到比较合理的教养。经验证明，这种做法简便易行，花钱不多，适应群众需要，也受到群众欢迎。但是有些父母认为日托不能解决他们的全部问题，要求全托。认为日托比全托会增加麻烦，认为工作之余带孩子是额外负担。企图把教养子女的责任全部推给托儿所、幼儿园。也有的对日托简便的设备和教养方法认为水平低不够满意，要求国家多多出钱把托儿所的水平提得越高越好，而自己负担的费用越少越好。这些思想显然是和今天的社会生活水平不相适应的，是和全面节约进行社会主义建设的精神背道而驰的，是和新中国公民应担负培养身心健康的后一代的职责不相符合的。只有提倡举办简便易行的日托组织，才能补充全托组织不能普遍举办的不足。而且办日托的人力、物力只需要办全托的一半，这样不仅能减少父母的经济负担，也才能使各机关、企业更切实地解决更多父母的问题。同时父母们还必须了解到托儿所、幼儿园并不可能完全代替父母的职责，父母教养子女的责任是什么时候也不能推卸的。事实证明：有些父母对教养子女确实是尽到了一定的责任，并积累了不少经验，但还有些父母对子女的教养却采取了错误的态度：有的是溺爱娇惯、有的是任意打骂，还有的是对子女生活学习的好坏漠不关心，或者是把对待成人教育的方法对待孩子。这些错误态度的产生，有的是由于受了资产阶级和封建残余的思想影响，有的是由于缺乏教育子女的新知识和方法。因此，要求父母们和社会上的成年人以社会主义的思想、观点教育儿童，彻底清除自己一切不正确的思想方法，努力学习教养子女的科学知识，并以自己对社会主义建设的忘我劳动精神和优良品德，给儿童作出榜样。教育儿童爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物；鼓励学龄儿童搜集废钢烂铁，帮助家庭劳动，养成勤劳朴素的生活习惯，在建设伟大祖国事业中尽到他们应尽的并可能尽的一分光荣责任。
    我们都知道，进行社会主义道德品质教育是社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的部分，特别是要真正改变旧社会遗留下来的不好的生活方式和旧制度的思想基础，我们就应该从认真教育后一代开始。因此在社会主义建设过程中，必须重视对儿童的品德教育。目前社会上存在着的剥削阶级的思想不断的在影响儿童，同时，盗匪、流氓、反革命分子正在千方百计地摧残儿童身心健康。如散播各种反动谣言威胁吓唬儿童、用迷信鬼怪来欺骗儿童、用小恩小惠引诱儿童，用反动的、淫秽的、荒诞的图书来腐蚀儿童，甚至组织流氓集团，进行偷窃或行凶殴斗，更严重的是他们野兽一般地强奸幼女、鸡奸幼童。为此，我们严正地要求对于那些摧残儿童的罪犯，应依法严予惩办；要求全体公民从关心和爱护儿童出发，监督和检举摧残儿童的坏人坏事。同时我们更恳切地要求每个父母、每个教师认真担负起教育儿童的责任。任何父母如果借口生产、工作忙，而不注意教育和关心子女；任何教师如果只管课内，不管课外，只管教书，不管教人；如果教师和家长不能相互密切合作，放松了从家庭、学校、社会各方面对儿童的品德教育，那末，就会给盗匪、流氓、反革命分子以可乘之机，就会给儿童带来终身的痛苦，这也就是对国家社会造下了莫大的罪恶。我们要求所有国家机关和人民团体的工作人员，特别是共产党员在教育子女和关心国家后一代方面要成为人民的榜样。我们还要求社会各方面给儿童工作以热情的关怀和支持，特别是文学艺术界要为儿童多多创作，来丰富父母们教育子女的知识。
    在中国共产党、人民政府和毛泽东主席正确的领导下，我们国家里，已经逐步地更广泛地树立了保护和关怀儿童的新风气。随着第一个五年计划的实施与完成，这就更给孩子们的成长提供了前所未有的良好条件。让我们更进一步共同努力，把新的一代教养成为身心健全的社会主义新人。
    刘九学代表的发言
    我完全拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案、一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算、中华人民共和国兵役法草案、根治和开发黄河的综合规划纲要，完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢副总理的报告，并坚决为其实现而奋斗。
    我是焦作煤矿的一个工人，从九岁时起就到焦作煤矿做工，我今年五十岁，已在焦作做工三十八年了。解放前，焦作煤矿在外国帝国主义，特别是日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治下，资本家不顾工人的死活，残酷地压榨与剥削工人群众，工人的生命和生活丝毫没有保证；生产条件极其恶劣，矿井出水、瓦斯爆炸和井下塌落的重大伤亡事故不断发生。在我十八岁的那年，焦作东四合煤矿发生了一次瓦斯爆炸，有二十三个工人惨遭重伤，把头发和全身的肉皮都烧掉，当受伤工人从井内爬上来以后，痛苦的只齐哭乱叫，没有人管，结果死了二十二人。我二十一岁的那年，四合井又发生了一次井内透水事故，一次就淹死工人三十余个。三个、五个的伤亡事故，更是平常的事情。工人死了以后，资本家连问也不问。在日本帝国主义统治时期，有时死了工人向资本家报告时，他们的回答是：“死十个八个的没关系，工人有的是。”工人的生活就更没有保障了，那时，不仅受帝国主义的压迫和剥削，还要受封建把头的压迫和剥削，资本家发给工人很少的工资，而封建把头又把工人工资买成坏粮食发给群众，工人所挣工资，不能维持工人的最低生活。一九三九年的时候，一个工人一天的工资只能买一斤半豆皮，工人能做工的时候，还可以勉强地维持生活，一旦遭到疾病和年老不能做工时，就要被活活地饿死。在破烂不堪的工人大宿舍里，有时一天就饿死工人和工人家属几十个，死后扔到窗户外边，连管也没有人管。在这种情况下，工人过着痛苦不堪的生活，做工都没有力气，生产情绪非常低落。
    解放以后，在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，工人的政治地位空前提高，各级党委和政府都非常关心工人群众的生活和福利，改善了生产条件，注意了安全管理。广大工人群众，经过了各种社会改革运动，政治觉悟大大提高，认识了生产是为了自己，树立了主人翁的劳动态度，充分发挥了工人群众的积极性和创造性，保证了安全生产，提高了生产效率。焦作煤矿自一九四八年解放到现在的七年多中，没有发生过重大的工伤事故，没有因事故死亡过一个人。安全生产的主要经验是：领导注意安全生产工作，有安全生产的具体措施；经常对工人群众进行安全生产教育，使群众认识安全生产的重要性，克服麻痹大意思想。让群众掌握安全技术，发动群众想办法；严格遵守劳动纪律，按保安规程进行工作；明确分工，建立责任制，建立奖惩制度；经常检查，发现问题，及时解决，那怕是很小的事故，也要认真处理，以防止事故的重复发生和扩大。总之，只要依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难。我在这里举个例子，焦作煤矿有一个几十年没有开采的老巷道，据传说里边有蛇和其他毒虫，没人敢进去，有煤不能开采，经过群众想办法又把这个巷道开辟出来，现在正在开采中。
    几年来，在保证安全的条件下，提高了技术，增加了生产。在一九五一年以前，焦作煤矿运煤还是用着落后的煤筐，用人工拉、抬，生产效率很低，每人每天只平均生产原煤零点八吨。一九五二年二月，经群众讨论，把小筐改成大筐，把用人工拉、抬改成用小车运，这样每人每天可生产原煤一点六吨，生产效率提高了一倍。一九五二年十月，工人同志们又努力学习了苏联的先进经验，把用小车运煤改成机械运煤，并采用了割煤机采煤，由每人每天平均生产煤一点六吨提高到五吨。由于技术的提高，现在已达到每人每天平均生产原煤八吨了，生产效率已比一九五一年提高了九倍。由于生产效率的提高，一九五四年提前三十一天完成了全年生产任务。同时，在提高劳动生产率和提高生产的基础上，也提高了工人的物质生活。解放前，工人每天的工资只能买一斤米，工人无房住，吃不饱，穿不暖。现在最低工资每人每月也可买一百余斤粮食，多者可以买粮食一千斤左右。工人现在吃的是细粮，穿的是洋布、卡叽和呢子衣服，病了公家设有医院，老了不能工作时有养老院，家庭生活特别困难者还有救济，生活完全有了保障。
    我们工作中虽有很大成绩，但也还有不少缺点，丝毫不能骄傲和自满。为了完成和超额完成第一个五年计划期内国家所给予焦作煤矿的生产任务，我们回去后，首先要认真地传达第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的决议和各种报告的精神，协助领导组织全体职工学习这次大会的各种文件报告，同群众一道，向着五年计划指出的光明大道奋勇前进。其次，要进一步开展劳动竞赛运动，提高生产效率，提高生产，降低成本。在劳动竞赛运动中，要继续发挥劳动模范的骨干、桥梁和带头作用，以腿勤、嘴勤和手勤的工作精神，来带动广大工人群众；依靠群众，有事和群众商量，发挥群众的集体智慧；加强文化和技术学习，推广先进经验，提高生产技术；同时要时时刻刻地关心群众生活和福利。把全体工人同志动员起来，在一九五五年，我们焦作煤矿争取超额完成国家计划原煤一万八千吨。
