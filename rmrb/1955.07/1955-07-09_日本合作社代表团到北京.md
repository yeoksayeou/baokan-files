　　Japanese Cooperative Delegation Arrives in Beijing

According to Xinhua News Agency, the 15-member Japanese Cooperative Delegation, invited by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to visit China, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 8th. The delegation was led by Head of Delegation Takeshige Ishiguro and Deputy Head of Delegation Umeo Oku.

Takeshige Ishiguro gave a speech at the train station. He said: "We are the Japanese Cooperative Delegation visiting China and the Soviet Union, invited by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. As we arrive in Beijing, we would like to express our deep gratitude to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and all the related gentlemen for giving us this opportunity to visit and for the profound friendship shown to us since we entered your country. This is a manifestation of the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people, which we are very grateful for. Generally speaking, the Japanese people today have a great concern for friendship with China. In particular, our colleagues in the cooperative movement are especially eager. In order to respond to the sincere goodwill of you gentlemen and to live up to the enthusiastic expectations of our Japanese cooperative colleagues, we will, within the limits of the time available, study the cooperative undertakings of your country and the lives of the masses of your people during our trip. At the same time, we would also like to introduce the current situation of Japanese cooperatives in order to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the cooperatives of your country and ours; and, to the extent possible, to open up a channel for material exchange, thereby consolidating the friendship between the people of the two countries and strengthening the foundation of world peace—lasting peace. We wish the development of China's cooperative cause!"
