The People's Congress of All Circles in the Capital of China has listened with great satisfaction to the report by Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation to the Helsinki World Peace Conference, on the situation and achievements of the conference.

The People's Congress of All Circles in the Capital of China fully endorses and supports the declaration and various proposals adopted by the Helsinki World Peace Conference, and warmly celebrates the historically significant achievements of the Helsinki Conference.

The Helsinki Conference placed the greatest hope and expectation on the Four-Power Summit, and clearly pointed out that the primary responsibility of the Four-Power Conference is to overcome mutual distrust, and to discuss major international issues, including the Far East issue, without interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, in order to further ease tensions and consolidate peace. The Helsinki Conference unanimously pointed out that it is necessary to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the destruction of existing atomic weapons, and the striving for the wide peaceful use of atomic energy, and suggested convening a disarmament conference on resolving the fundamental issues of consolidating peace.

The Helsinki Conference called on the people of all countries to oppose military aggression groups that threaten peace and the security of all countries and foreign military bases established in various countries, and pointed out that these are in conflict with the United Nations Charter. The conference announced its support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, as well as the spirit and principles of the Asian-African Conference, and demanded the implementation and development of economic and cultural cooperation between countries with different systems.

We welcome and thank the Helsinki Conference for its unanimous and just demands that foreign troops must withdraw from China's territory of Taiwan and that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations be restored.

We unanimously believe that the series of correct propositions put forward by the Helsinki Conference on behalf of world public opinion are necessary steps to further ease the international situation and eliminate the threat of a new war, which is completely in line with the common interests and wishes of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world.

However, we must point out that although the Four-Power Summit adopted part of the Helsinki Conference's appeals and reached preliminary agreements, the issues concerning Asia, despite being solemnly raised by the Soviet leaders, were not placed on the agenda. This proves that the cause of defending peace requires further efforts from the people of all countries in the world. Therefore, the People's Congress of All Circles in the Capital of China calls on the people of the whole country to heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and use the practical actions of victoriously completing the great Five-Year Plan to further strengthen and expand the struggle to defend peace; and to work together with the people of all countries in the world to overcome all kinds of obstacles and difficulties, and strive for the comprehensive realization of the declaration and various proposals of the Helsinki Conference.

We firmly believe that the struggle of the world's people to safeguard peace will surely continue to defeat the war activities of the enemies of peace in the future, and achieve a brilliant final victory.

    首都各界人民大会拥护赫尔辛基世界和平大会宣言和各项建议的决议
    中国首都各界人民大会非常满意地听取了出席赫尔辛基世界和平大会中国代表团茅盾团长关于大会情况和成就的传达报告。
    中国首都各界人民大会完全拥护和支持赫尔辛基世界和平大会所通过的宣言和各项建议，并热烈庆贺赫尔辛基大会所获得的具有历史意义的成就。
    赫尔辛基大会对四国首脑会议寄予最大的希望和期待，并明确指出四大国会议的首要职责是克服相互间的不信任，在不干涉别国内政的情况下讨论重大国际问题，包括远东问题在内，以便进一步缓和紧张局势，巩固和平。赫尔辛基大会一致指出，必须争取禁止原子武器、销毁现存的原子武器，和争取广泛和平利用原子能，并建议召开一个关于解决巩固和平的根本问题的裁减军备的会议。
    赫尔辛基大会号召各国人民反对威胁着和平和各国安全的军事侵略集团和在各国建立的外国军事基地，并指出这些是与联合国宪章相抵触的。大会宣布，支持中国和印度所倡导的和平共处五项原则，以及亚非会议的精神和原则，要求不同制度的国家之间实行和发展经济和文化合作。
  　我们对赫尔辛基大会一致提出的外国军队必须撤出中国领土台湾和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的公正主张，表示欢迎和感谢。
    我们一致认为，赫尔辛基大会代表全世界公众舆论所提出的一系列正确的主张，都是进一步缓和国际局势和消除新战争威胁所应采取的必要步骤，这是完全符合中国人民和世界各国人民的共同利益和愿望的。
    但是我们必须指出，四国首脑会议对赫尔辛基大会的呼吁虽然采纳了一部分，达成了初步的协议，但关于亚洲方面的问题，尽管已由苏联首脑郑重提出，但并未列上议事日程。这就证明：保卫和平的事业是须得世界各国人民作更进一步的努力的。因此，中国首都各界人民大会号召我全国人民，提高警惕，加强团结，以胜利完成伟大五年计划的实际行动，来进一步加强和展开保卫和平的斗争；并和世界各国人民一起，克服各种阻碍和困难，为争取全面实现赫尔辛基大会的宣言和各项建议而共同努力。
    我们坚决相信，世界人民维护和平的斗争在今后必定能够不断击败和平敌人的战争活动，而获得辉煌的最后胜利。
