Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 1st: According to Indonesian newspapers, Indonesia's internal political situation has greatly intensified recently due to the reactionary forces in Indonesia stepping up their attacks on the Sastroamidjojo government.

The ostensible reason for these attacks is the authorities' appointment of General Bambang Utojo (one of the well-known figures who actively participated in the struggle against Dutch colonialism) as Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army. Among those who opposed this appointment were some senior officers of the General Staff, headed by Acting Chief of Staff Colonel Lubis, and several regional garrison commanders. Colonel Lubis refused to hand over his post to General Utojo. Reports indicate that the officers who disobeyed government orders have close ties with the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party, and it is well known that these two parties are linked to the United States and the Netherlands. The Indonesian "People's Daily" pointed out on June 30 that the military group headed by Lubis "attempts to establish a military dictatorship and a system that threatens the freedom and democracy of our republic."

　　反动势力以反对任命新参谋长事
　  攻击印度尼西亚政府
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社雅加达讯：据印度尼西亚报纸报道，最近由于印度尼西亚反动势力对沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府加紧攻击，印度尼西亚的内部政治情况已大大紧张起来。
    这些攻击的表面原因是当局任命（积极参加反对荷兰殖民主义者的斗争的著名人物之一）班邦·乌多约将军为印度尼西亚陆军参谋长。反对这次任命的有以代理参谋长卢比斯上校为首的参谋部的一些高级军官和若干地区的卫戍司令官，卢比斯上校拒绝把职务移交给乌多约将军。从报道中可以看出，违抗政府命令的军官同马斯友美党和社会党的关系很密切，而大家都知道这两个党是同美国和荷兰有联系的。印度尼西亚“人民日报”六月三十日指出，以卢比斯为首的军事集团“力图建立军事独裁，建立威胁我们共和国的自由和民主的制度”。
