Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 3rd: The Indian Cultural Delegation, headed by Mr. Chanda, today visited the historically valuable Shaanxi Provincial Museum and Library, which houses historical relics of cultural exchange between China and India from over a thousand years ago.

　　After hearing the museum curator's introduction to the many Buddhist relics preserved in the museum, Mr. Chanda, Mrs. Chanda, and some members of the delegation carefully visited the various exhibition rooms. In the Stele Forest, the guests saw the stone tablet recording the story of the Indian monk Guangzhi Sanzang, who came to China more than 1,300 years ago to translate Buddhist scriptures. They were very interested in inquiring about Guangzhi Sanzang's lifelong dedication to introducing Buddhist scriptures to China and his death in China. They also viewed the scriptures he translated from Sanskrit into Chinese. Upon seeing the "Dharani Sutra Pillar" jointly engraved in Chinese and ancient Indian languages from the Tang Dynasty, Mr. Chanda immediately approached the pillar to carefully identify and read the ancient Indian text on it. In front of the Purple Bamboo Guanyin Stone Carving, Mrs. Chanda touched the lines of the stone carving with her hand, carefully examining this work of art and repeatedly admiring the reproduced Dunhuang murals. Upon seeing the Chinese Tang Dynasty stringed and wind instruments on the "Orchestra" mural, Mr. Chanda told the museum staff, "We still have such instruments in India."

　　The guests also visited the Stone Carved Buddha Statue Gallery, the Grotto Art Exhibition Room, the Bronze Ware Exhibition Room, the Primitive Society Exhibition Room, and the famous Tang Dynasty "Zhaoling Six Steeds." When leaving the museum, Mr. Chanda signed a beautifully made commemorative album, saying that he hoped to have more time to carefully observe all the historical and artistic relics preserved here.

　　As the guests left the museum, the crowd that had been waiting for a long time released peace doves and cheered to the guests: "Welcome the Indian Cultural Delegation!" These enthusiastic people were residents near the museum. After hearing the news of the Indian guests' visit, they waited in the rain for two or three hours to express their welcome.

　　At the Shaanxi Provincial Library, the guests learned that it houses more than 17,000 volumes of Buddhist scriptures. The library director told the distinguished guests: "As early as the mid-1st century AD, Buddhism was introduced to China from India, and at that time, the Xi'an area was the center for accepting Indian culture." While visiting the scripture storage and the stacks, Mr. Chanda said, "This is very similar to the library of the Chinese Academy of International University in India."

　　Today, the Indian guests also visited Guangren Temple, the Drum Tower, and the state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory in Xi'an.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 3rd: Over 1,300 spectators in Xi'an enjoyed the long-awaited art performance by the Indian Cultural Delegation on the evening of the 3rd.

　　Before the performance began, Fang Zhongru, the mayor of Xi'an, on behalf of the people of the city, extended a warm welcome and gratitude to the Indian artists for their performance in Xi'an. Mr. Chanda then gave a speech expressing his thanks. At this moment, a young Chinese actress ran onto the stage to present flowers to Mr. Chanda. Afterwards, the Indian artists met the Xi'an audience with an instrumental ensemble as the first program. The performance of five instruments in this program immersed the audience in the wonderful variations of the melody. When the dancer Ms. Rahman floated up with her gentle and graceful "Bharatanatyam" dance, the painter Zhao Wangyun immediately captured this moving image in his sketch. In all eleven performances, many programs were encoreed more than four times. Many audience members praised in low voices again and again.

　　At the end of the performance, sixty literary and art workers from Xi'an presented flowers and flower baskets to all members of the delegation. Zhao Boping, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, Fang Zhongru, Mayor of Xi'an, Yu Xun, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Culture Bureau, and Hu Cai, Director of the Xi'an Municipal Culture Bureau, went to the stage to shake hands cordially with the Indian artists and express their gratitude for their wonderful performance.

　　印度文化代表团参观陕西省博物馆和图书馆
　　印度艺术家在西安举行艺术表演
    新华社西安三日电　今天以钱达团长为首的印度文化代表团参观了富有历史价值的陕西省博物馆和图书馆，这里，珍藏有千余年前中印文化交流的历史文物。
    钱达团长、钱达夫人和部分团员听了博物馆馆长介绍馆内保存的许多有关佛教文物等情况后，到各个陈列室仔细地参观了这些文物。在碑林中，客人们看到记叙印度广智三藏和尚在一千三百多年前来中国翻译佛经的石碑后，极有兴趣地询问了广智和尚终身为向中国介绍佛经并死在中国的事迹，并且看了他由梵文译成中文的经文碑；钱达团长看到中国唐代用中印两国文字合刻的“陀罗尼经幢”后，立刻凑在幢前仔细辨认，并且读上面的古印度文。在紫竹观音图石刻前，钱达夫人用手抚摸着石刻线条，仔细观看了这幅艺术品，并且反复欣赏了临摹的敦煌壁画。当看到“乐队”这幅壁画上的中国唐代弦乐器和管乐器后，钱达团长告诉博物馆的人说：“在我们印度，现在还有这样的乐器。”
    客人们还参观了石刻佛像廊、石窟艺术陈列室、青铜器陈列室、原始社会陈列室和著名的唐代“昭陵六骏”。离开博物馆时，钱达团长在一册精制的纪念册上签名留言，他说他希望能有更多的时间仔细观察这里保存的一切历史和艺术的文物。
    当客人们离开博物馆时，门前伫候已久的人群放起和平鸽，并向客人们欢呼：“欢迎印度文化代表团！”这些热情的人们都是博物馆附近的居民，他们听到了印度客人来访的消息后，在雨中等待了两三个小时，来向客人们表示欢迎。
    在陕西省图书馆，客人们得知这里珍藏有一万七千多册佛经，图书馆馆长并告诉贵宾：“远在公元一世纪中叶，佛教就从印度传入中国，而当时，西安一带是接受印度文化的中心。”在参观藏经和书库时，钱达团长说：“这和印度国际大学中国学院图书馆很相像。”
    今天，印度客人们还参观了西安的佛教寺院广仁寺、鼓楼和国营西北第三棉纺织厂。
    新华社西安三日电　西安市一千三百多观众在三日晚欣赏了他们盼望多时的印度文化代表团的艺术表演。
    表演开始前，西安市市长方仲如代表全市人民对印度艺术家们在西安的演出表示热烈欢迎和感谢。钱达团长接着致词表示谢意。这时，一位中国少年女演员跑上台去向钱达献花。接着，印度艺术家们以乐器合奏作为第一个节目和西安观众见面。这个节目以五种乐器的演奏使观众沉醉在美妙的旋律的变奏中。当舞蹈家拉赫曼女士飘起轻柔袅娜的“婆罗多舞”时，画家赵望云立刻把这种动人形象留在他速写的画面上。在全部十一个节目演奏中，有不少节目连续谢幕达四次以上。不少观众并低声连连称赞。
    演出结束时，西安市文艺工作者六十人向代表团全体团员献花和花篮。陕西省副省长赵伯平，西安市市长方仲如，陕西省文化局局长鱼讯，西安市文化局局长胡采亲到台上同印度艺术家们亲切握手，并对他们的精采演出表示谢意。
