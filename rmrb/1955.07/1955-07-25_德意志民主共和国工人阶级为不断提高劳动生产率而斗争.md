    The Working Class of the German Democratic Republic Struggles to Continuously Improve Labor Productivity
    German Democratic Republic Gong Te·Yan Xi
    In the German Democratic Republic, more and more workers are recognizing their own creative power as creators of the new social system. They are breaking old operating methods, using their brains to find tricks, and striving to save working time, materials, and funds. State-owned industrial and mining enterprises all have such production innovators, who play a leading role among employees with their conscious and exemplary labor. In order to manufacture more, better, and cheaper products to meet the needs of all the people, they are constantly striving to improve production. In the process of promoting new operating methods, workers can almost always get help from relevant Soviet experience. Here is an example:
    In order to rebuild cities destroyed by the war and expand our industry, we need a lot of building materials, especially bricks. Therefore, advanced workers in brick factories are striving to find new brick-burning methods that can increase production. In 1950, they heard about the great achievements of the Soviet brickmaker Duvanov. Duvanov reduced the time for burning a kiln of bricks from 170 hours to 56 hours by placing the bricks further apart from each other in the kiln. According to this method, although the number of bricks placed in the kiln was reduced, the area and fuel of the kiln were better utilized, increasing the monthly output per cubic meter of kiln area from 1,200 to 2,100 bricks.
    As early as the end of 1950, workers at the Hecklingen Steam Brick Factory, under the leadership of their factory director and activist Sge Laya, learned from Soviet experience and reduced the time for burning a kiln of bricks from the original 182 hours to 99 hours, increasing production by 64 percent. Activist Sge Laya was awarded a national bonus for his outstanding achievements.
    With the support of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the trade unions, our brick-making industry held the so-called Duvanov Conference. Through these conferences, all brick factories soon implemented new operating methods. The new brick-burning method, which is now widely used, has accelerated our country's construction and saved the country millions of marks since 1950.
    But this is just one example. New operating methods have been implemented in various industrial sectors and types of work, and good results have been achieved. Now, advanced workers in various industrial sectors are striving to universally implement the rapid maintenance method. In terms of power production, people have begun to take action, because it is this sector that first needs to reduce the time required for overhauls to a minimum, in order to continuously increase the supply of electricity to the economy and the people.
    The rapid maintenance method requires that all work, whether in preparation or during the overhaul process, must be precisely planned. The time required for each type of work must be accurately calculated in order to formulate technical norms for various tasks during the overhaul of main and secondary equipment. There is a principle in this regard, which is that preparatory work must be carefully arranged and the time required for various tasks must be precisely specified.
    Many power plants in our republic have greatly shortened the maintenance time. For example, the Hapke power plant shortened the maintenance time of a 36,000-kilowatt generator by 21 days, increasing power generation by 12 million kilowatt-hours. The benefits this brings to the national economy are obvious.
    The metal processing methods of Soviet innovators Bekov, Rishikov, Kosovkin, etc., Lunin's machine maintenance method, and Amosov's steelmaking method have also been promoted in the German Democratic Republic. Some methods were quickly adopted by the working people. Some methods were initially met with skepticism from workers for a long time. The trade unions, through persistent publicity and education work, explained to the workers that the new operating methods would reduce their labor, increase their income, increase production, and save financial and material resources for the national economy.
    Currently, our republic has dispatched instructors to work in major enterprises. Their task is to patiently explain the innovators' operating methods to the workers, and to perform on-site demonstrations as much as possible so that these methods can be universally adopted.
    The 21st Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held in November 1954, analyzed the economic situation of the state-owned economy and put forward a series of major economic tasks to party members in state and economic organs and to the entire working class. The purpose of these tasks is to fully tap all the potential forces in the economic sector, make better use of material, financial, and human resources, in order to more rapidly improve the living standards of the people of our republic.
    The Party pointed out at that time that in the past, socialist enterprises concentrated their main efforts on completing and overfulfilling production plans, thus often neglecting other plans, such as cost reduction plans and profit plans. As a result, 27 percent of state-owned enterprises were operating at a loss. In order to smoothly carry out production tasks, they needed subsidies from the state. Such a method of work naturally greatly increased the burden on the state finances and affected the continuous improvement of the people's living standards. Therefore, we must find ways to eliminate this situation.
    The employees of loss-making enterprises are very clear about this. Therefore, after studying the resolutions of the 21st Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, they put the issue of enterprise profitability on the agenda of production meetings as the center of discussion. Production meetings are a way for workers to consciously and voluntarily participate in leading and improving the production work of state-owned enterprises outside of working hours. The initiator of production meetings is the trade union. Before holding a production meeting, the enterprise party organization first conducts a thorough analysis of the enterprise's situation. Based on this analysis, the workers can be clearly informed at the meeting about savings, labor productivity, and the causes of shortcomings in their work area. Experience has shown that after the workers in each team and workshop understand the economic situation of the enterprise at the production meeting, they will put forward many suggestions to overcome the shortcomings.
    All the suggestions put forward at the production meeting are collected and then discussed at the enterprise economic meeting convened by the enterprise party organization after full preparation. The result of this meeting is to decide on very specific measures to enable the enterprise to reverse the loss situation in 1955, and complete various plans, including both production plans and financial plans.
    The "Heinrich Rau" State-Owned Heavy Machinery Factory and the Berlin Treptow Machine Tool Factory played an outstanding leading role in this regard. The "Heinrich Rau" Heavy Machinery Factory received a state subsidy of 3.4 million marks in 1954, and the Berlin Treptow Machine Tool Factory received 798,000 marks. The two enterprises jointly submitted a statement to the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, guaranteeing to reverse the loss-making situation in 1955. The "Heinrich Rau" factory will hand over 300,000 marks in profits to the state, and the Berlin Treptow factory will hand over 100,000 marks in profits to the state. They emphasized in their statement that now that the Bonn Federal Parliament has approved the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to further strengthen the German Democratic Republic so that the German Democratic Republic can become a source of strength for all patriots to fight against the re-militarization of West Germany and strive for the establishment of a unified, independent, and peace-loving Germany. At the same time, they also called on all state-owned enterprises to learn from their example.
    Since then, the working people of our entire republic have widely launched a movement to eliminate state subsidies or increase enterprise profits. The completion of the plan in the first quarter of 1955 reflects the initial good results.
    Of course, in this regard, it is necessary to constantly overcome the resistance of old things not only among workers, but also among economic workers. Some people believe that all possibilities for improving labor productivity have been exhausted; some people always underestimate the strength of the working class and ignore the suggestions put forward by workers at production meetings. This struggle for new things is not over yet. But the working people are increasingly aware that their future good life depends on their labor today. Therefore, they are more and more actively assisting in improving the work of enterprises.
    Socialist emulation is the most important method to improve labor productivity. However, this kind of emulation should be carried out openly between groups and groups, individuals and individuals with specific conditions. Only when a worker guarantees to achieve a certain goal and challenges other workers doing similar work can a healthy socialist emulation be launched and continuously achieve greater achievements.
    Louise Irmissi, director of the State-Owned Moorhausen Clothing Factory and Labor Hero, excellently organized the socialist emulation. She knows how to implement the principle of material interest to organize the competition between individuals. The enterprise plan is allocated to each workshop. In this way, every worker knows clearly how much he should produce and how much he can earn in a certain period. In addition, the factory also implemented a system of rewarding workers with outstanding work performance and high product quality, which in the past was based on groups. Defective products must be registered in detail.
    As a result of adopting all these measures, the enthusiasm of the workers' emulation was aroused, the scrap rate was reduced, labor productivity was improved, and the plan was overfulfilled. Since every worker knows their production target, they can put forward specific guarantees to improve work efficiency, and everyone can calculate their income. This is one of the reasons for achieving good results.
    Among the working people of our country, the "Louise Irmissi Method" as a new form of socialist emulation has become a fixed concept. Efforts are being made everywhere to study the possibility of promoting this method in other enterprises.
    The working people of the German Democratic Republic are increasingly aware that in their worker-peasant state, their lives depend on everyone themselves, and on their efforts in implementing the policies of the Party and the government. As we learn to adopt the most advanced working methods, improve the socialist organization of labor, and manage the national economy in accordance with socialist principles, our republic becomes stronger. At the same time, our efforts also strengthen the confidence of our West German compatriots in improving their social conditions and striving to restore the unity of our divided motherland, and strengthen the powerful camp of peace, democracy and socialism.

    德意志民主共和国工人阶级为不断提高劳动生产率而斗争
    德意志民主共和国  龚特·严希
    在德意志民主共和国，越来越多的工人认识到了他们自己作为新社会制度的创造者的创造性力量。他们打破旧的操作法，开动脑筋找窍门，努力节约工作时间、材料和资金。各国营工矿企业都有着这种生产革新者，他们用自觉的模范的劳动在职工中间起着带头作用。为了制造更多、更好和更便宜的产品来满足全体人民的需要，他们不断地努力提高生产。在推行新操作法的过程中，工人们几乎都可以从苏联有关的经验中获得帮助。这里举一个例子：
    为了重建被毁于战争的城市和扩建我国工业，我们需要许多建筑材料，特别是砖瓦，因此造砖厂的先进工人努力寻求新的能增加产量的烧砖法。一九五○年，他们听到了苏联制砖师杜万诺夫的巨大成就。杜万诺夫在砖窑里放置砖坯时使每块之间的距离远一些，把烧一窑砖的时间从一百七十小时减少到五十六小时。按照这个方法，放到窑里去的砖虽然减少了，但却更好地利用了砖窑的面积和燃料，使每立方公尺砖窑的面积每月产量从一千二百块增加到二千一百块。
    早在一九五○年年底，赫克林恩蒸汽造砖厂的工人就在他们的厂长、积极分子史格拉亚的领导下学习了苏联经验，把烧一窑砖的时间从原来所需要的一百八十二小时减为九十九小时，增加了产量百分之六十四。积极分子史格拉亚因为他的杰出成就而获得了国家奖金。
    在德国统一社会党和工会的支持下，我国造砖工业举行了所谓杜万诺夫会议。通过这些会议，所有造砖厂不久都推行了新操作法。今天已普遍采用的新烧砖法，加速了我国的建设，自一九五○年起，为国家节省了千百万马克的资金。
    但这只是一个例子。各个工业部门和工种都推行了新操作法，并获得了良好的成绩。现在，各工业部门的先进工人正在为普遍推行快速检修法而奋斗。在电力生产方面，人们已开始行动起来，因为正是这个部门首先需要把大修所需要的时间减少到最低限度，以便不断地增加供应给经济和人民的电力。
    快速检修法要求所有工作不论在准备或大修过程中都必须有精确的计划性。每种工作所需时间都要经过准确的计算，以便制定出主要设备和次要设备大修期间各种工作的技术定额。在这方面有一条原则，那就是：必须认真地安排准备工作，并精确地规定各种工作所需要的时间。
    我们共和国已有许多发电厂大大地缩短了检修时间。例如，哈普克发电厂把一台三万六千瓩的发电机的检修时间缩短了二十一天，增产了一千二百万度电力。这给国民经济带来的好处是很显然的。
    苏联革新者贝科夫、李希科夫、科索夫金等人的金属加工法、鲁宁的机器保养法和阿莫索夫的炼钢法，也在德意志民主共和国得到了推广。有些方法迅速地获得了劳动人民的普遍采用。有些方法在开始时也曾遭到工人较长时期的怀疑。工会通过坚持不懈的宣传教育工作向工人说明了新操作法会减轻他们的劳动，增加他们的收入，增加生产，为国民经济节约财力和物力。
    目前我们共和国派有指导员在各大企业中工作，他们的任务就是耐心地向工人解释革新者操作法，并且尽可能地进行实地表演，使这些方法能为大家普遍采用。
    一九五四年十一月间举行的德国统一社会党中央委员会第二十一次全体会议，分析了国营经济的经济情况，并向国家机关和经济机关中的党员以及全体工人阶级提出了一系列重大的经济任务。这些任务的目的是充分地挖掘经济部门中的一切潜在力量，更好地利用物力、财力和人力，以求更迅速地提高我们共和国人民的生活水平。
    党在那时指出，过去社会主义企业把主要力量都集中在完成和超额完成生产计划方面，因而时常忽略了其他计划，例如降低成本的计划和赢利计划的完成。结果有百分之二十七的国家企业都是亏本的。为了顺利地执行生产任务，它们需要国家给予补助。像这样一种工作方法当然大大地增加了国家财政的负担，影响了人民生活水平的不断提高。因此，必须想办法来消除这种情况。
    亏本企业的职工对这一点的认识是很清楚的。因此，他们在学习了德国统一社会党中央委员会第二十一次全体会议的决议以后，就把企业赢利问题提到生产会议上作为讨论的中心。生产会议是工人在工作时间以外举行的自觉自愿地参加领导和改善国营企业生产工作的一种方式。生产会议的发起者是工会。在举行生产会议之前，企业党组织对企业情况先作一番彻底的分析。根据这种分析，就能在会议上向工人清清楚楚地说明他们工作范围内的节约情况、劳动生产率情况以及产生缺点的原因等。经验表明，各小组和各车间工人在生产会议上了解企业的经济情况之后是会提出许多克服缺点的建议的。
    在生产会议上提出的所有建议都收集起来，然后在企业党组织召开的、事前经过充分准备的企业经济会议上加以讨论。这种会议的结果是决定出十分具体的措施，促使本企业在一九五五年内扭转亏损局面，完成各种计划，既包括生产计划，也包括财务计划在内。
      “亨利希·劳”国营重型机器厂和柏林特莱普托工作母机厂在这方面起了杰出的带头作用。“亨利希·劳”重型机器厂一九五四年领取了三百四十万马克的国家补助金，柏林特莱普托工作母机工厂领取了七十九万八千马克。这两个企业向德国统一社会党中央委员会联合提出一项声明，保证在一九五五年扭转亏本局面，“亨利希·劳”工厂要上缴利润三十万马克给国家，柏林特莱普托工厂要上缴十万马克给国家。它们在声明中强调指出，现在当波恩联邦议院批准巴黎协定之后，必便进一步增强德意志民主共和国的力量，以便把德意志民主共和国变成为一切爱国者为反对西德重新军国主义化，争取建立统一、独立、爱好和平的德国而斗争的力量源泉。同时，它们还号召所有国营企业学习它们的榜样。
    从那时起，我们全共和国的劳动人民广泛地展开了不要国家补助或提高企业赢利的运动。一九五五年第一季度计划的完成情况，反映出了初步的良好成绩。
    当然，在这方面不但在工人中，而且也要在经济工作人员中经常克服旧事物的反抗。有些人认为提高劳动生产率的一切可能性都已挖掘尽了；有些人总是低估工人阶级的力量，漠视工人在生产会议上提出的建议。这个争取新事物的斗争还没有结束。但劳动人民已越来越清楚地认识到，他们未来的美好生活有赖于他们今天的劳动，因此，他们愈来愈积极地协助改进企业的工作了。
    社会主义竞赛是提高劳动生产率的最重要方法。但是，这种竞赛应当是由小组和小组间、个人和个人间公开提出具体的条件。只有当一个工人保证达到一定的目标并向其他作类似工作的工人发出挑战时，才能展开健全的社会主义竞赛，并不断获得更大的成就。
    国营摩尔豪森被服厂厂长、劳动英雄露伊丝·艾尔米西出色地组织了社会主义竞赛。她懂得怎样贯彻物质兴趣的原则，来组织个人和个人之间的竞赛。企业计划被分配到每个车间去。这样，每个工人都知道得清清楚楚，在某一时期内他应当生产多少，能收入多少。此外，该厂还实行了奖励工作成绩优越和产品质量上等的工人的制度，过去这是以小组为单位的。所出的废品都要详详细细地登记下来。
    采用所有这些措施的结果，启发了工人的竞赛热忱，废品率降低了，劳动生产率提高了，计划超额完成了。由于每个工人都知道自己的生产目标，因而就能提出提高工作效率的具体保证，并且每人都能计算出自己的收入，这也是获得良好成就的原因之一。
    在我国劳动人民中，作为社会主义竞赛新形式的“露伊丝·艾尔米西法”已成为一个固定的概念了。各地都在努力研究在其他企业中推行这种方法的可能性。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民越来越清楚地认识，在他们的工农国家中，他们的生活有赖于每个人自己，有赖于他们在执行党和政府的政策方面的努力。随着我们学习采用最先进的工作法、改进社会主义劳动组织和按照社会主义原则管理国民经济的程度的增长，我们的共和国也就愈加强大了。同时我们的努力也增强了我们西德同胞为改善他们社会状况和争取恢复我们被分裂的祖国的统一而斗争的信心，增强了强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
