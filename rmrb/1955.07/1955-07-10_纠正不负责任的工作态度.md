　　Correcting Irresponsible Work Attitudes

　  A Salesman Who Doesn't Understand His Business Editor:

　　In early October of last year, the Tianzhen County Company of the China Department Store sent someone to the Datong City Hardware Company to negotiate the purchase of a batch of "bantie" (板铁 - plate iron) in order to meet market needs. Among the commodities handled by the Hardware Company, there was only "biantie" (扁铁 - flat iron) and no item called "bantie." The purchasing personnel returned without buying the "bantie." A few days later, the Tianzhen County Company sent salesman Zhao Renfeng to the Datong Hardware Company for procurement again. Zhao Renfeng looked at the samples and said to Ye Hongming, who came with him, "If there's no 'bantie,' let's just buy the 'biantie'!" The salesman of the Datong Hardware Company also went along, saying, "Biantie is bantie." So they purchased 25,003 kilograms of "biantie" according to the original plan. When this batch of "biantie" was transported to Tianzhen, it was always left in the warehouse and could not be sold. Why couldn't a commodity that was urgently needed be sold? It turned out that what the market needed was not "bantie" but "tieban" (铁板 - iron plate). The business personnel got it wrong, and then mistakenly purchased "biantie." This kind of "tieban" is an indispensable raw material for the local ironware production cooperative, with a thickness of two fen (十分之一寸，十分之一厘米) and a width of one to two chi (1 chi = 1/3 meter), while "biantie" is only one or two cun (1 cun = 1/10 meter) wide, completely unsuitable. As a result, only 18.5 jin (市斤 - approximately 9.25 kilograms) were sold in more than half a year. In the end, this batch of unwanted "biantie" had to be returned to the Datong Hardware Company.

　　The purchase and return of this batch of "biantie" directly caused a loss of 1,642 yuan to the state (including bank interest, round-trip freight, and price difference between purchase and return). As for the losses caused in production due to insufficient raw material supply, they are even more difficult to calculate.

　　A Sleeper's Erroneous Journey Editor:

　　On May 8th, a wagonload of sleepers, totaling 404, arrived at Liubei Station, which is under the jurisdiction of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau. This batch of sleepers was sent from Tieli Station, which is under the jurisdiction of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau. Liubei Station had no plan to receive sleepers, so why was a batch of sleepers sent? They sent a telegram to the dispatching station to inquire. On May 14th, Liubei Station suddenly received a telegram from the director of the Fengtai Material General Warehouse saying: "Our factory urgently needs this material. Why did Tieli Station change the destination? Please send it back quickly." However, Tieli Station replied by telegram saying: "Our station did not propose a change." This made Liubei Station feel very strange, because the waybill for this wagonload of sleepers clearly stated: "According to Tieli Stationmaster's telegram No. 60 of April 30th, the destination was changed to Liubei Station." And it was stamped with the official seal of Huangguatun Station's change and the personal seal of the person in charge, Tang Chengzhi. Why did they say that Tieli Station did not propose a change? Later investigation revealed that this wagonload of sleepers was originally destined for Beihedian Station. Because Tieli Station made a mistake when preparing the ticket, writing Beihedian as Beihai City, this wagonload of sleepers arrived at Huangguatun Station, and after searching all railway station names in the country, there was no Beihai City, so it could not be shipped. Later, when Tieli Station telegraphed Huangguatun Station to correct it, Huangguatun Station mistakenly translated Beihedian Station as Liubei Station. This wagonload of sleepers had no choice but to come to Liubei Station from the distant north. "A difference of one character" caused an erroneous journey of 2,099 kilometers, resulting in a total loss of more than 2,000 yuan in freight and miscellaneous expenses.

　　A Remittance of 2,000 Yuan for Purchasing Materials Was Delayed Editor:

　　Our Fourth Engineering Team of the Highway Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Communications is building a Qingshui River Bridge in Wubu County, northern Shaanxi. The higher authorities stipulated that this bridge must be completed before this year's rainy season to avoid the impact of floods. This task is, of course, urgent. On May 14th, the engineering team sent someone to Liulin Town, Shanxi (40 li - approximately 20 kilometers from Wubu County) to purchase and transport timber. In order not to violate the state's cash management system, we handed over the cash required for the purchase and transportation to the Wubu County People's Bank of Shaanxi Province for remittance, planning to transport the timber back within three days.

　　Unexpectedly, the person in charge waited in Liulin Town for five days without seeing the remittance. On the 19th, he sent someone back to Wubu to find the Wubu County People's Bank to inquire. The bank comrade replied: "Okay! We'll check." By the 22nd, the money had not been received. At this time, the accountant went to the bank again to inquire. The Wubu Bank stated: "Yes! We'll check!" But by the 25th, the money had not been received, so we had to stop work and wait for materials. Why did it take twelve days for the money to be remitted over a distance of 40 li? Where exactly is this remittance of 2,000 yuan resting? The Wubu County Bank should answer this question.

　　A Parcel Locked in the Warehouse Editor:

　　The Transportation Section of the Jilin Provincial Grain Bureau had entrusted the Ministry of Grain to purchase a batch of "Regulations and Supplementary Rules for the Transportation of Goods" from the People's Railway Publishing House in Beijing in April, preparing to organize study at the grassroots transportation worker conference to be held on June 2nd. The conference on June 2nd has passed, and these materials have not yet arrived, so the Transportation Section of the Grain Bureau made a long-distance phone call to the Ministry of Grain to inquire. The Ministry of Grain replied: "This batch of books was sent in full from Beijing on April 23rd." According to this reply, the Transportation Section inquired at the Grain Bureau's office. The comrades in the office said: "We have not received this batch of books." The Transportation Section also searched from the root to the tip in Changchun City, Jilin Province Post Office, Beijing Ministry of Grain, People's Railway Publishing House, and Beijing Post Office. All the procedures and vouchers proved that this batch of books had been sent. Moreover, the Changchun Post Office also kept the receipt signed by the Grain Bureau's office. So where did this batch of books go? It turned out that this batch of books was sent from Beijing on April 23rd and arrived in Changchun on April 27th. At that time, the Changchun Post Office sent the postal slip to the Grain Bureau, and Wang Shutang of the Grain Bureau's office personally retrieved this batch of books and then locked them in the small warehouse. This fact reflects that the work system of the Jilin Provincial Grain Bureau is somewhat chaotic!

　　The Jilin Provincial Grain Bureau should carefully check and correct this chaotic situation.

　　纠正不负责任的工作态度
　  不懂业务的业务员编辑同志：
    去年十月上旬，中国百货公司天镇县公司为了适应市场需要，派人到大同市五金公司洽购一批板铁；五金公司经营的商品中，只有扁铁没有板铁这项名称。采购人员没买到板铁就回去了。过了几天，天镇县公司又派业务员赵人峰去大同五金公司采购，赵人峰看了看样品对同来的叶鸿明说：“没有板铁就把扁铁买上吧！”大同五金公司的业务员也顺水推舟地说：“扁铁就是板铁”。于是他们照原定计划就采购了扁铁二万五千零三公斤。当这批扁铁运到天镇以后，一直是搁在仓库里销不出去。为什么急需的商品却又销不出去呢？原来市场上需要的不是板铁而是铁板，业务人员把它搞错了，采购时又错成扁铁。这宗铁板是当地铁业生产合作社不可缺少的原料，有二分厚，一尺至二尺宽，而扁铁才一、二寸宽，根本不合用。因此半年多的时间才销了十八斤半（市斤）。最后只好把这批没人要的扁铁仍然退回大同五金公司。
    这批扁铁的购进和退回，直接给国家造成了一千六百四十二元的损失（包括银行利息、往返运费以及采购退货的差价）。至于因原料供应不足，在生产上造成的损失那就更难计算了。

　  一车枕木的错误旅行编辑同志：
    五月八日柳州铁路管理局所属柳北站到达枕木一车，计四百零四根。这批枕木是由齐齐哈尔铁路管理局所属的铁骊站发来的。柳北站没有要枕木的计划，为什么发来一批枕木？就打电报向发货站查问。五月十四日柳北站突然接到丰台材料总库库长的电报说：“该料我厂需用甚急，铁骊站为何变更到站？请速运回。”而铁骊站回电说：“我站并未提出变更。”这使柳北站感到太奇怪了，因为这车枕木的运单上明明写着：“依铁骊站长四月三十日第六十号电变更到柳北站。”并盖有皇姑屯站变更公章及经办人唐承志的私章。为什么说铁骊站没有提出变更呢？后来查明原来这车枕木本是运往北河店站，因为铁骊站制票时，将北河店误为北海店，以致这车枕木到达皇姑屯站后，遍查全国铁路站名没有北海店，因此无法挂运；后来铁骊站电请皇姑屯站予以更正时，不料皇姑屯站竟将北河店站误译为柳北站。这车枕木便不得不从遥远的北方来到了柳北站。“一字之差”造成了错误旅行二千零九十九公里，共计损失运杂费两千多元。

　  两千元购料的汇款被延误了编辑同志：
    我们陕西省交通厅公路局第四工程队在陕北吴堡县修建一座清水河桥。上级规定这座桥要在今年雨季前完工，以免遭受洪水的影响。这个任务当然是紧迫的。五月十四日工程队就派人到山西柳林镇（距吴堡县四十华里）购运木料，为了不违背国家现金管理制度，我们把购运所需的现款交给陕西省吴堡县人民银行汇兑，计划在三天之内把木材运回。
    不料，经办人到柳林镇等候了五天还没见到汇款，十九日就派人返回吴堡找吴堡县人民银行追问，银行同志答复是：“好吧！我们查查。”到二十二日钱还没有收到，这时会计员又到银行去追查，吴堡银行申明说：“对！我们查查！”可是到二十五日款子还没收到，以致我们不能不停工待料。为什么四十里的路程用了十二天时间款子还汇不到呢？究竟这两千元的汇款在那里休息呢？吴堡县银行应该回答这个问题。
          陕西省交通厅公路局第四工程队　刘俊民
　  被锁在仓库里的邮包编辑同志：
    吉林省粮食厅运输科曾在四月份委托粮食部向北京人民铁道出版社购买了一批“货物运送规则及补则”，准备在六月二日召开的基层运输员会议上组织学习。六月二日的会议已经过去了，这批材料还没有来到，因此粮食厅运输科就打长途电话向粮食部追问。粮食部答复说：“四月二十三日已将这批书籍由北京如数发出了”。运输科根据这个答复到粮食厅办公室查询。办公室同志说：“没有收到这批书籍”。运输科又向长春市、吉林省邮局及北京粮食部、人民铁道出版社及北京邮局从根到稍的寻查了一番，一切的手续和凭据都证明了这批书籍已经发出了；而且长春邮局还保存着粮食厅办公室的签收单据。那末这批书籍究竟到什么地方去了呢？原来这批书籍四月二十三日由北京发出后在四月二十七日已经到了长春，当时长春邮局把邮单送到了粮食厅，粮食厅办公室的王树堂亲自取回这批书籍以后，一直就送进小仓库锁起来了。这件事实反映了吉林省粮食厅的工作制度是有些混乱的！
    吉林省粮食厅应该好好地检查和纠正这样的混乱状况。
