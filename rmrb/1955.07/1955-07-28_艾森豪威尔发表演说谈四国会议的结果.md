Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 26th (TASS dispatch): U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a televised radio address to the nation on the evening of July 25th, discussing the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Good evening, friends.

The Secretary of State and I, along with our colleagues, went to the Geneva Four-Power Conference determined to represent as accurately as we could the desire of the American people for peace and the principles on which this nation believes peace should be based.

We received bipartisan support in this work from Congress, indeed almost unanimous support from Congress. This fact greatly strengthened our position throughout the negotiations. We would like to express our gratitude to all Senators and Representatives in the United States Congress. In addition, we have received thousands of telegrams of encouragement and support from you in the past few weeks in your individual capacities. At the same time, we have received similar telegrams from many important organizations—church organizations, business organizations, and important labor organizations.

All of this combined makes me feel that we may be faithfully representing the opinions you want us to represent. Peace and the pursuit of peace involve many troublesome problems. For example,

Fairness to all nations, large and small; the freedom and security of all these nations;

The economic prosperity of some of them and the improvement of world living standards.

Finally, the opportunity for all of us to live in peace and security.

Of course, we are not reckless in studying these issues. We must be prudent and careful in drawing conclusions and in subsequent actions. We cannot afford negligence and complacency, but we must have hope. We must have confidence in ourselves and in the justice of our cause. If we are not, we will allow our own pessimism and our own lack of confidence to frustrate the noblest purpose we can pursue.

Because all of these issues are of utmost importance, our government will spend many weeks studying them thoroughly. What I can tell you tonight are, at most, some personal impressions and opinions that you may find of some interest and that undoubtedly have some bearing on the outcome and process of those negotiations.

Of course, if I had the time, one interesting issue to talk about would be the personalities, the personalities of several delegations, their relationships with each other, or the apparent considerations that seem to drive these relationships. These are related to this question, but I don't want to talk about these. I just want to talk about two general opinions that I believe every American agrees with.

The first of these is this: we must never be deceived into believing that a week of friendly, even fruitful, negotiations can completely eliminate a problem that has separated East and West so widely. This chasm is as wide and as deep as the difference between individual liberty and organization, as wide and as deep as the gap between the concept that man is created in God's image and the concept that man is merely an instrument of the state. If we think about these things, we may easily feel discouraged.

However, I also deeply feel that we must all avoid feeling discouraged simply because our own suggestions, our own methods, and our own beliefs cannot be accepted by the other party forever and immediately.

On the night I left for Geneva, I explained to you on television what we would be seeking. I told you then that we were going primarily to try to change the spirit upon which these great negotiations and conferences were based. That talk was recorded, and I would now like to read you a passage from it.

Regarding our purpose, I said at the time: "We recognize that one factor has been missing in past conferences. This is the honest intention to be willing to reconcile, to understand, to be tolerant, to try to understand the views of others as we understand our own. I tell you that if we can change the spirit upon which these conferences are based, then we will have taken the greatest step in the pursuit of peace, future prosperity and tranquility that has ever been taken in the history of mankind.”

These goals have been pursued over the past week in formal meetings and private visits. Therefore, there is now a better understanding and closer unity among the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

There seems to be a growing recognition that nuclear war, in the end, can actually be racial suicide.

It is recognized that negotiations can be conducted without propaganda, threats, and abuse.

Finally, the world profoundly recognizes that the United States is willing to do anything consistent with our concepts of integrity and justice and the right to achieve peace. To this end, we will work together with the Soviets and any other people, as long as there are sincere purposes and a genuine desire to move forward.

In the course of these discussions, there were several specific proposals, some of which were items on the formal agenda. This agenda included the German reunification issue, the European security issue, the arms reduction issue, and the issue of expanding contacts between East and West.

Most of the meetings held in the conference room were widely publicized, and even some of the specific proposals made at these meetings were similarly publicized. Anyway, I can guarantee you one thing: no secret agreements have been made—no agreements of understanding or written agreements. Everything is formally before you.

In addition to the meetings in the conference room, there were also many informal meetings, which were conversations with important members of other delegations, and of course, especially with the Soviet delegation.

In these conversations, issues were discussed, in which the Secretary of State and I specifically presented the beliefs and views of the United States and the concerns of the United States regarding issues such as Eastern European satellite states and the activities of international communism more than once. We clearly stated the views of the United States on such issues. Now let's talk about the items on the formal agenda.

Probably no issue has caused as much trouble as the issues of German reunification and European security. Initially, we thought these issues could be dealt with separately, but the US delegation finally concluded that these two issues must be discussed as one issue.

We believe that Germany should be reunited under a government freely chosen by the Germans themselves under conditions that ensure the security of both Eastern and Western countries; in fact, it should be reunited within a system that can provide European security.

On the issue of disarmament, the U.S. government believes that an effective disarmament system can only be based on an effective system of mutual inspection and comprehensive supervision, a system in which we can have confidence and in which both sides can know that the other is fulfilling its obligations. With this belief, we, along with France and Britain, put forward some proposals. Some of these are global in nature, some are local, and some are budgetary in nature. But all proposals are aimed at promoting this one goal, namely: to make inspection the basis of disarmament proposals.

One suggestion advocated aerial photography by unarmed peaceful aircraft between the Soviet Union and us, and that such inspection should be as thorough as reconnaissance could make it. Of course, the main purpose is to convince everyone of the sincerity of the West in seeking peace. But another idea is: if we can begin to establish this inspection as the beginning of an inspection system, we may develop it into a broader system and eventually build an effective and lasting disarmament system on the basis of this system.

On the issue of increasing contacts, many items were discussed. We discussed the issue of freer exchange of news regularly through this curtain. We discussed the distribution of books, and in particular we discussed the issue of peaceful trade. But what struck me most in this regard was the issue of the possibility of more visits by citizens of one country to the territory of another, in which everyone would have the fullest opportunity to learn about the people of other countries. The greatest possible degree of agreement has been reached on this issue; in fact, this is an agreement that has been repeated often and enthusiastically supported by the words of people on all sides.

In fact, each side expressed its sincerity to the other, and often assured that it intended to adopt a new spirit of reconciliation and cooperation in its contact with the other. Of course, we deeply hope that these assurances will be faithfully fulfilled.

One proof of these guarantees will, of course, soon be seen in the words used in those speeches and exchanged diplomatic documents. The acid test will begin in October this year, as the next meeting will be held at that time. It will be a meeting of foreign ministers, the main purpose of which will be to accept the conclusions of this meeting, the conclusions on the issues to be discussed and the conclusions on the general procedures to be followed in turning what we have discussed in general into practical and concrete agreements. That is when true reconciliation and some concessions from each side will certainly be necessary.

I personally do not underestimate the obstacles that lie ahead on the road to a solid and just peace. I never underestimate the long, arduous work that must be done before achieving real results. I do not evade the fact that all of us must continue to make sacrifices in order to best protect our own security and preserve what we believe in, according to our beliefs.

But I know for sure that the people of the world want peace.

Furthermore, everyone else in Geneva felt the same human desire. So there is great pressure to make constructive progress, not just to repeat the lifeless performances of the past, the negative performances.

The task that all of us, whether as individuals or as a nation, now shoulder may be the most difficult task in our country's history. Likewise, we are given the most shining opportunity that Americans have never been given before. May this truth inspire us and never discourage us.

I believe that only by maintaining pious patience, wisdom, courage, and tolerance, and never forgetting vigilance and prudence, can we keep the sparks ignited in Geneva burning. But if we succeed in this, then we will make this lamp constantly brighter, a lamp that will one day guide us to our goal—a just and lasting peace.

Thank you. Good night to each of you.

    艾森豪威尔发表演说谈四国会议的结果
    新华社二十七日讯　塔斯社华盛顿二十六日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔二十五日晚在电视中向全国发表广播演说，谈日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果。演说全文如下：
    晚安，朋友们。
    国务卿和我，以及我们的同事们，前往参加了日内瓦的四大国会议，决心尽我们所能精确地代表美国人民要求和平的愿望以及这个国家认为和平应以之为基础的原则。
    我们在这种工作中得到国会中的两党的支持，而且的确几乎是国会的一致的支持。这个事实大大地加强了我们在整个谈判中的地位。我们谨向美国国会中的全体参议员和众议员表示感谢。除此以外，我们在过去的几星期中收到了你们以个人名义发来的数以千计的表示鼓励和支持的电文。同时，还收到了许多重要的组织——教会组织、商业组织和重要的劳工组织——发来的同样电文。
    所有这一切合起来，使我觉得我们可能是在忠实地代表你们要我们代表的意见。和平与追求和平牵涉到许多麻烦的问题。例如，
    对不论大小一切国家的公正；一切这些国家的自由和安全；
    它们某些经济的繁荣和世界生活水平的提高。
    最后是我们大家都生活在和平和安全中的机会。
    当然罗，我们在研究这类问题时，并不是冒失从事的。我们在得出结论时和在以后的行动中必须审慎和小心。我们经不起疏忽和自满，但是我们必须抱有希望。我们必须对我们自己和对我们事业的正义性抱有信心。如果我们不是这样，我们将听凭我们自己的悲观和我们自己的缺乏信心来挫败我们能够追求的最崇高的目的。
    由于这一切问题有极其重要的意义，我们政府将花许多星期的时间来彻底研究。今天晚上我能够告诉诸位的，至多是一些你们可能感到有些兴趣的、而且对那些谈判的结果和过程无疑有一些关系的个人印象和意见。
    当然，如果我有时间的话，可以谈谈的一个有趣的问题是人物、好几个代表团的人物，他们彼此之间的关系，或是表面上的关系，看来是推动这些关系的主要考虑。这些同这个问题是有关系的，但是我不想讲这些，我只想谈两点我相信每一个美国人都同意的一般性意见。
    其中第一点就是：我们切不能被骗而相信一个星期的友好的、即使是卓有成效的谈判就能完全消除把东西方隔得如此远的鸿沟所引起的一个问题，这条鸿沟就像个人自由和组织化之间的差别一样宽、一样深，就像人是按照上帝的模型创造的这种概念和人仅仅是国家工具这种概念之间的鸿沟一样宽、一样深。如果我们想到这些事情，我们就可能容易感到灰心丧气。
    但是，我也深深感到我们大家必须避免仅仅因为我们自己的建议、我们自己的办法和我们自己的信仰不能永远立即就被对方接受就感到灰心丧气。
    在我动身前往日内瓦那天晚上，我在电视台上向你们说明我们将要谋求的东西。我当时告诉你们，我们去主要是为了设法改变举行这种伟大的谈判和会议所依据的精神。那次谈话作了记录，现在我愿意从其中选一段给你们念一下。
    关于我们的目的，我当时是这样说的：“我们认识到，过去历次会议中一直缺少一个因素。这就是肯和解，谅解，容忍，设法像我们了解我们自己的观点那样来了解他人的观点的诚实意图。我对你们说，如果我们能够改变举行这些会议所依据的精神，那末我们将是在谋求和平，未来的繁荣和安宁方面采取了一个在整个人类史上从没有采取过的最大的步骤”。
    在上星期中，在正式的会议和私人的拜访中，曾经追求了这些目的。所以，现在北大西洋公约组织国家之间有了更好的谅解和更密切的团结。
    大家似乎越来越认识到，核子战争，进行到最后，实际上能够是种族自杀。
    大家认识到，谈判是能够在没有宣传、威胁和谩骂的情况下进行的。
    最后，全世界深刻地认识到，在符合于我们的正直和正义的概念以及取得和平的权利的情况下，美国什么事情都愿意做。为此目的，我们将同苏联人和任何其他人民通力合作，只要有诚恳的目的和希望前进的真正愿望。
    在进行这些讨论的过程中，有若干具体建议，其中有些是列在正式议程上的项目。这个议程上有德国统一问题、欧洲安全问题、裁减军备问题和扩大东西方之间各种接触的问题。
    在会议室举行的大多数会议都得到广泛的宣传，甚至连在这些会议上提出的某些具体建议也同样被公开宣传了。不管怎样，我可以对你们担保一件事情：没有订立任何秘密协议——谅解的协议或书面的协议。所有的东西都正式放在你们面前。
    除了会议室内的会议之外，还举行了许多非正式会议，这就是同其他代表团的重要团员进行的交谈，当然特别是同苏联代表团的交谈。
    在这些交谈中，讨论了一些问题，在这些问题中，国务卿和我不止一次具体地提出美国的信念和美国的见解和美国对于诸如东欧卫星国和国际共产主义活动等问题的关心。我们清楚地讲明了美国对于这类问题所持的见解。现在谈一下正式议程上的项目。
    大概没有任何问题引起像德国重新统一和欧洲安全问题所引起的那样多的麻烦了。最初，我们认为这些问题可以分别予以处理，但是美国代表团最后得出结论，这两个问题必须作为一个问题来讨论。
    我们认为，德国应当在使东方国家和西方国家都得到安全的条件下重新统一在一个由德国人自己自由选择的政府之下；事实上，就是在一个能够提供欧洲安全的体系之内重新统一。
    在裁军问题上，美国政府认为，要达成一个有效的裁军制度，只能以有效的相互视察和全面监督制度为基础，这是一个我们能够具有信心而且双方能够知道对方正在执行他的义务的制度。由于有这个信念，我们同法国和英国一起提出了一些建议。其中有些是全球性的，有些是地方性的，有些是属于预算性质的。但是一切建议都是为了促进这个唯一的目标，那就是：使视察成为裁军建议的基础。
    一个建议主张由没有武装的和平飞机在苏联和我们之间进行空中摄影，并且使这种视察做到这种侦察可能做到的那样彻底。当然，主要的目的是使每个人相信西方寻求和平的诚意。但是另外一个想法是：如果我们能够着手建立这种视察作为视察制度的开始，我们可能把它发展成为一个较为广泛的制度，并最后在这个制度的基础上建立一个有效的和持久的裁军制度。
    在不断增加接触问题方面，讨论了许多项目。我们讨论了关于经常通过这个帷幕进行较自由的新闻交流的问题。我们讨论了关于书籍的发行，特别是我们讨论了关于和平贸易的问题。但是，在这方面最使我注意的是关于一个国家的公民到另一个国家领土上去进行更多的访问的可能性的问题，在这方面要使得每个人都有可能的最充分机会去了解其他国家的人民。在这个问题上已达成了可能最大程度的协议；事实上，这是一个常常被重复的、并且为每一方人员的言词所热情支持的协议。
    事实上，每一方都对另一方表示其诚意，并且常常保证，它打算在它同另一方接触中采取一种和解和合作的新精神。当然，我们深望这些保证将予以忠实地履行。
    关于这些保证的一个证明，当然将不久在那些演说和互换的外交文件中所使用的语词中看到。严格的考验当在今年十月开始，因为那时将举行下一次会议。那将是一次外长会议，其主要目的将是接受这个会议的结论，关于要讨论的问题的结论和关于在把我们所讨论的一般的东西变成实际具体的协议时所应遵守的一般程序的结论。那时候才是真正的和解和每一方的某种让步将是肯定地必要的时候。
    我个人是不轻视在前面横在通向巩固和公正的和平的道路上的障碍的。我绝不低估在取得真正的结果前必须做的那种长期的费力的工作。我不规避这样的事实：我们所有的人必须继续为了照我们的信念最好地保障我们自身的安全和保存我们所信仰的东西而作出牺牲。
    但是我确知世界人民是希望和平的。
    此外，在日内瓦的其他每一个人同样感到人类的这种渴望。因此有一种很大的压力，要求作出建设性的进展，而不仅仅是重复过去那种无生气的表演，消极的表演。
    我们全体，不论是作为个人还是作为一个民族，现在所担负的可能是我国历史上最为艰难的任务。同样，我们得到美国人所没有得到过的最光辉的机会。希望这种真理鼓舞着我们，永不使我们沮丧。
    我相信，只有保持虔诚的忍耐、明智、勇气和容忍，并且永不忘记警惕和谨慎，我们才能使在日内瓦点燃起的火星继续燃烧着。但是如果我们在这方面获得成功，那末，我们将使这个灯经常变得更为明亮，这个灯将有一天指引我们走向我们的目标——一个公正的和持久的和平。
    谢谢你们。向你们每一个人道晚安。
