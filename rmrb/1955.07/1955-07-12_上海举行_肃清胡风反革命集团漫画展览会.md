The exhibition also includes excerpts from the preface of the book "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" and People's Daily editorials and editor's notes on the Hu Feng incident. The content of the cartoons exhibited at the ten locations is the same. Each location has one hundred and twelve works, by thirty-eight cartoonists from across the country and eighteen amateur worker-artists.

This exhibition will also be held in Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Hefei, Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and other places.

The Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House has selected a portion of the exhibited works for mass printing to meet the needs of propaganda and posting in small and medium-sized cities, streets, and alleys. The Shanghai Film and Lantern Mechanical Manufacturing Factory has also compiled a set of slides from some of the cartoon works.

The Chinese Artists Association will also hold the "Exhibition of Cartoons on Purging the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace and other locations.
