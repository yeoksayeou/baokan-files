Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 16th: "Pravda" published an editorial on the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the approval of the results of the negotiations between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, commenting on the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

"Pravda" said that as a result of the Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations, the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have undergone a dramatic change.

Of great significance for the development and consolidation of sincere friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is the fact that social ownership of the basic means of production occupies a dominant position in Yugoslavia. The working class and the working peasantry are the basic classes of Yugoslavia. The fact that the working class and peasants hold power determines the political structure of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has maintained its national independence and resisted the efforts of foreign capital to penetrate its economy. The implementation of a socialist foreign and domestic policy, and the expansion and consolidation of Yugoslavia's political and economic ties and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, are of great significance for Yugoslavia's further progress along the road of socialist construction.

"Pravda" wrote: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that it is appropriate to establish contact and achieve reconciliation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. Preliminary results have now been achieved, and conditions are in place for establishing such contact and achieving such reconciliation. It is hoped that this reconciliation will continue and develop on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. This is in the interests of the people of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

The working people of Yugoslavia recognize that the Soviet Union is not and cannot be a source of threat to the Yugoslav people and Yugoslav national independence. As a socialist country, the Soviet Union is concerned about the consolidation of Yugoslavia's new social system and the strengthening of the power of the working people. The aim of the imperialists is to restore capitalism in Yugoslavia and to deprive it of its national independence. The working people of Yugoslavia are resisting the implementation of these imperialist conspiracies, because they hold power not in order to return all the wealth of the people to domestic and foreign oppressors.

"Pravda" concluded by saying that the Soviet people unanimously hope to develop and strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries for the benefit of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, for world peace, and for the international labor and communist movement and its ultimate goals.

    “真理报”社论评苏南两国友好关系的发展
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”就苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于批准苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府代表团谈判结果的决议发表社论，评论苏联和南斯拉夫之间的友好关系的发展。
    “真理报”说，由于苏南谈判的结果，苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系已经发生了急剧的转变。
    对苏南两国之间的真挚友好关系的发展和巩固具有重大意义的是，基本生产资料的社会所有制在南斯拉夫占优势地位。工人阶级和劳动农民是南斯拉夫的基本阶级。工人阶级和农民掌握政权这一事实决定了南斯拉夫的政治结构。南斯拉夫维护了它的民族独立，抵抗住了外国资本渗入它的经济的努力。一种社会主义的外交和内政政策的实施，南斯拉夫同苏联及人民民主国家的政治和经济联系与合作的扩大和巩固，对于南斯拉夫的进一步沿着社会主义建设的道路的进展有着重大意义。
    “真理报”写道：苏联共产党认为在马克思—列宁主义原则的基础上建立接触并且实现苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的和解，是相宜的。现在已经取得了初步的成果，建立这种接触并且实现这种和解的条件已经具备了。希望这种和解将在马克思—列宁主义的原则上继续和发展。这是符合苏南两国人民的利益的。
    南斯拉夫劳动人民认识到，苏联不是而且也不可能是对南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫民族独立的威胁的来源。作为一个社会主义国家，苏联是关心南斯拉夫的新社会制度的巩固和劳动人民力量的加强的。帝国主义者的目的是在南斯拉夫恢复资本主义，和使它丧失民族独立。南斯拉夫劳动人民正在抵抗帝国主义者这些阴谋的实施，因为他们掌握政权不是为了把人民的全部财富交还给国内和外国的压迫者。
    “真理报”最后说，苏联人民一致希望为了苏南两国的利益，为了世界和平，为了国际劳工和共产主义运动和它的最终目的，而发展和加强两国之间的友好关系。
