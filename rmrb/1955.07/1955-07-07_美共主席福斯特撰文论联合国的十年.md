Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th: New York dispatch: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on June 30th, entitled "The United Nations' Ten Years." He wrote that the United Nations should serve the cause of peace, but the American ruling clique turned the United Nations into a tool for launching imperialist wars during the Korean War.

　　Since the Korean War, tremendous changes have taken place in the world. The will of the people of the world to oppose the war acts of the American warmongers and to safeguard peace is playing an increasingly important role. In Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, and many other capitalist and colonial countries, sentiments for peace and neutralism have greatly increased. The epoch-making Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries was held. India and Yugoslavia are now more firmly adopting a peaceful stance.

　　Today, the vast majority of people in the world oppose the bellicose line of U.S. imperialism. They hope to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, they hope that the People's China will obtain its place in the United Nations, they hope that Taiwan will be returned to China, they hope that East-West trade will be opened up, they hope that the current international tensions will be eased through peaceful negotiations, and they hope that all countries in the world will pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence—all of which are diametrically opposed to what the warmongering U.S. big capitalists and their agents in Washington hope for.

　　Foster said that the people of the world must continue and intensify their current struggle for peace so that the United Nations transforms into the peace organization it should be.

　　美共主席福斯特撰文论联合国的十年
    新华社柏林五日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党主席威廉·泽·福斯特六月三十日在纽约“工人日报”发表文章，题目是“联合国的十年”。他写道，联合国应该为和平事业服务，但是美国统治集团在朝鲜战争中却把联合国变成发动帝国主义战争的工具。
    自从朝鲜战争以来，世界上已经发生了巨大的变化。全世界人民反对美国黩武分子的战争行径、维护和平的意志正愈来愈发生作用。在英国、德国、法国、日本、意大利和其他许多资本主义和殖民地国家中，和平和中立主义情绪大大增长。具有划时代意义的亚非国家的万隆会议举行了。印度和南斯拉夫现在正更加坚定地采取和平立场。
    今天，世界上绝大多数人反对美帝国主义的好战路线，他们希望禁止原子弹和氢弹，他们希望人民中国取得它在联合国里的地位，他们希望台湾还给中国，他们希望东西方贸易开放，他们希望目前的国际紧张局势通过和平谈判得到缓和，他们希望世界各国奉行和平共处的政策——所有这一切都是同好战的美国大资本家和他们在华盛顿的代理人希望的东西截然相反的。
    福斯特说，全世界人民要继续并加紧进行他们目前的争取和平的斗争，使联合国转变成为它应该成为的和平组织。
