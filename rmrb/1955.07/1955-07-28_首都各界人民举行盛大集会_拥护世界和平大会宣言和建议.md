Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: People from all walks of life in the capital, numbering over five thousand, held a grand rally on the evening of the 27th to enthusiastically endorse the declaration and various proposals passed by the World Peace Congress in Helsinki.

　　The Zhongshan Park Music Hall, serving as the venue for the rally, was filled with participants. Among them were members of the Standing Committee of the China Peace Committee, leaders and representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations, some deputies to the National People's Congress, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, all representatives of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress in Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

　　Some representatives from Syria, Iraq, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Australia who had attended the World Peace Congress and were visiting China, as well as peace activists from various countries in Beijing, were also invited to attend the rally.

　　At 8:30 PM, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress, Chen Shutong, deputy head of the delegation, and others, along with Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, Ryuko Oyama, a Japanese peace activist, Ahmad Abaza, a member of the Syrian Peace Committee, and his wife, Aida Mirjan, a Syrian peace representative, William Gollan, Vice Chairman of the Australian National Peace Council, D. Costa Falcon, head of the Brazilian delegation, and his wife, ascended to the rostrum. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause.

　　Also ascending the rostrum with Guo Moruo were World Peace Council members Liao Chengzhi, Cai Tingkai, Ma Yinchu, Shao Lizi, Luo Longji, Li Dequan, Liu Ningyi, Wu Yaozong, Chu Tunan, Qian Duansheng, Hu Yuzhi, Zhao Yimin, Hua Luogeng, and Li Yimang, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Yun, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League.

　　Today's rally was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, who said in his opening remarks that the Helsinki World Peace Congress was attended by over 1,800 representatives from 68 countries, representing a very wide range. This shows that the foundation of the peace movement has indeed become increasingly solid over the past few years, and the forces for defending peace have indeed become increasingly strong.

　　After discussing the significant achievements of the conference, Guo Moruo said that the people of the world must further unite and work together to fully realize the call of the Helsinki World Peace Congress. Our 600 million Chinese people are willing to work unremittingly with the people of the world to achieve this goal.

　　Guo Moruo pointed out that many representatives who attended the World Peace Congress participated in today's rally, and he expressed his heartfelt respect and gratitude to all foreign guests attending the rally, and through them, he expressed his highest respect to the people and peace organizations of various countries they represent. He said, dear peace friends, you must be able to see today how the fruits of your hard work at the World Peace Congress are enthusiastically supported by the Chinese people. The Chinese people all know that our national construction and peace defense are inseparable.

　　Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress, conveyed to all attendees the situation and achievements of the historically significant World Peace Congress. In his report entitled "Moving Forward on the Road to Lasting Peace and Friendly Cooperation" (the full text of the report can be found on the second page), Mao Dun analyzed the international situation at the time of the conference and pointed out the breadth of representation of the delegates attending the conference and the widespread and enthusiastic support it received. After discussing the major achievements of the conference, Mao Dun called on the people of the country to continue their efforts to further ease international tensions and safeguard world peace.

　　After Mao Dun's report, Chen Shutong, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress and Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, spoke, describing his impressions of the World Peace Congress.

　　Chen Shutong said that the Helsinki World Peace Congress was convened at a time when the international situation had shown new opportunities for easing tensions during the long struggle between peace forces and war forces. Therefore, it is of great significance for uniting and expanding the peace forces to promote the further development of the peace movement and promote the further easing of the international situation. The attendance of the conference by unprecedentedly broad-based people from all walks of life in 68 countries with different political and religious beliefs once again powerfully demonstrates that the peace forces, which are increasingly playing a major role in the development of the international situation, are growing stronger day by day. Through free discussion and exchange of views, the conference reached a consensus on all major international issues of the moment and adopted a historic declaration and various proposals, fully expressing the common aspirations and strong peace demands of the vast number of people around the world.

　　Chen Shutong spoke of the four-power summit that had recently concluded after achieving positive results. He said that although the meeting failed to discuss the situation in Asia, especially the situation in the Taiwan region and Indochina, based on the Soviet Union's repeated proposals, which was a great regret, the meeting had made a good start for easing international tensions and increasing mutual trust and cooperation between countries. We hope that this spirit of consultation can be maintained and expanded, which will continue to promote the easing of the international situation and ensure the maintenance of peace.

　　Chen Shutong finally said that all the proposals put forward by the Helsinki World Peace Congress are important indicators for the people of our country and other countries in the world to strive for peace in the future, and we must do our best to promote the full realization of these proposals.

　　Mao Dun's report and Chen Shutong's speech were warmly welcomed by the audience, and people constantly applauded enthusiastically for the major achievements of the World Peace Congress during their speeches.

　　At the rally, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and Zhang Yun, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, also spoke. They respectively represented the workers, youth, and women of the country, expressing their full support for the declaration and resolutions passed by the World Peace Congress.

　　When Lai Ruoyu spoke, he first expressed warm congratulations on the success of the World Peace Congress. He said that the Chinese people bear a major responsibility for defending peace, and every achievement in our socialist construction is a contribution to the cause of peace. When we successfully build a socialist society, it will be the best guarantee of world peace. In order to defend peace, the most practical action for the Chinese working class is to resolutely complete and overfulfill our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, to faithfully and exemplarily implement the Military Service Law, to actively support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and to heighten vigilance and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. For Chinese trade union workers, it means organizing labor competitions more deeply and specifically, caring for the lives of workers more intimately and thoughtfully, and helping workers improve their political awareness, cultural, and technical level more seriously and realistically. The Chinese working class will unite more closely with the people of the country, build our motherland, and defend world peace.

　　Hu Keshi said that our youth are indeed an important force in the world peace team. Because we understand that as long as the youth of the world are not fooled by war mongers, as long as we bravely shoulder the responsibility of peace fighters, all the plans of war mongers will fail. Therefore, we Chinese youth must strive for the declaration of the World Peace Congress and for the realization of the various proposals of the Congress.

　　Hu Keshi said: Defending peace means ensuring the sacred inviolability of the territory and sovereignty of every country. We Chinese youth firmly oppose colonialism, and we Chinese youth will never forget that our sacred territory of Taiwan is still occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, which is sheltered by the American aggressors. We say that we must fight to the end to liberate this piece of territory.

　　Zhang Yun said: We Chinese people and Chinese women have always firmly supported the peace foreign policy of the People's Government, actively participated in the world peace movement, and strived unremittingly to expand the world peace forces. In order to further ease international tensions, prevent the enemies of peace from attempting to continue to stir up the Cold War and strive for lasting peace, we Chinese women will resolutely respond to the call of the World Peace Congress, remain forever faithful to the cause of peace, and strive to achieve permanent peace. Zhang Yun pointed out in her speech that the recently held World Mothers' Congress represented the demands and aspirations of mothers all over the world and was also completely in line with the spirit of the World Peace Congress. Its purpose is: "To protect children, oppose war, strive for disarmament, and promote friendship between the people of all countries." We Chinese women are willing to work to realize the four major calls of the World Mothers' Congress. At the same time, this will be used as a common belief of mankind to educate children and children, so that the new generation of New China will establish the noble virtue of loving peace from an early age.

　　When peace friends from Japan, Syria, Brazil, and Australia were invited to speak, warm applause rang out in the venue.

　　Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, said that the Helsinki Congress, with the participation of representatives from 68 countries, made a resolution to the people of the world: Governments of all countries should strive to ease international tensions through consultation. On the basis of increasing public opinion pressure, international tensions can certainly be eased. The success of the recent four-power summit first confirmed the correctness of this resolution.

　　Oyama Ikuo said that the Japanese people wholeheartedly welcome the World Peace Congress, and the Japanese people fully support the resolutions of the Helsinki World Peace Congress. They are demanding that the Japanese government start negotiations with China to normalize relations between the two countries. The Japanese people especially welcome the Helsinki Congress to designate August 6 as an international memorial day for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments. In order to implement this resolution, preparations are currently underway to hold an international conference in Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6 to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons. The China Peace Committee has expressed its willingness to send representatives to participate in the Hiroshima conference. I would like to express my gratitude here for this effort and friendship of the Chinese people. All peace workers from China and Japan will stand shoulder to shoulder with peace-loving people in Asia and the world, work together, and move forward to fully realize the resolutions of the Helsinki World Peace Congress.

　　Ahmad Abaza, a member of the Syrian Peace Committee, then spoke. He said that in China, we have seen the victories you have achieved in peaceful construction, just as we have seen the peaceful victories you have won internationally.

　　He said that the declaration and various proposals passed by the Helsinki World Peace Congress are a great victory for the world's peace forces, and all peace-loving people will support the declaration and various proposals of the Congress.

　　Abaza finally shouted: "Long live the friendship of the people of all countries!" "Long live the great Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong!" "Long live world peace!"

　　Falcon, head of the Brazilian delegation, spoke on behalf of the people of Latin American countries and the peace representatives of Latin American countries visiting China. He said that coming to Beijing is like returning to our own family, like returning to our own brothers. After we return to our country, we will fight more strongly for peace, because in China we have a better understanding of the significance of the cause of peace, and we will tell the people of our country the peace aspirations of the Chinese people. Falcon said: China should get its place in the United Nations, Taiwan should be returned to China, and the Latin American people firmly support the struggle of the Chinese people. He also paid tribute to the Chinese people on behalf of the Latin American people, congratulating the Chinese people on their achievements in the struggle to liberate their motherland and defend peace.

　　William Gollan, Vice Chairman of the Australian National Peace Council, emphasized in his speech at the meeting that we must work with the people of all countries in the world to jointly complete the historical task facing our generation - that is, to forever eliminate war from the world. I guarantee that the Australian peace movement will complete its task in this struggle and persevere in this struggle until final victory.

　　After these speeches, the audience unanimously raised their hands to approve the resolution endorsing the declaration and various proposals of the Helsinki World Peace Congress. When the resolution was passed, prolonged applause resounded throughout the venue.

　　After the conference, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe performed brilliant programs.

    今天的大会，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若主持，他在致开会词中说，赫尔辛基世界和平大会有六十八个国家的一千八百多位代表参加，代表性非常广泛。这表明了几年以来和平运动的基础确是日益雄厚，保卫和平的力量确是日益壮大了。
    郭沫若在谈了会议所取得的重大成就后说，世界人民为了全面实现赫尔辛基世界和平大会的号召必须更进一步团结一致共同努力。我们六亿中国人民愿意和世界人民一道为达成这一目标而作不懈的奋斗。
    郭沫若指出，今天有不少出席世界和平大会的代表参加了今天的大会，他向所有参加大会的外宾表示衷心的敬意和感谢，并通过他们向他们所代表的各国人民和各国和平组织表示崇高的敬礼。他说，各位和平友人们，你们在今天一定可以看到，你们在世界和平大会上辛勤劳动的成果是怎样地受到中国人民的热烈拥护。中国人民都知道，我们国家的建设事业和和平保卫事业是分不开的。
    中国出席世界和平大会代表团团长茅盾向全体到会者传达了具有历史意义的世界和平大会的情况和成就。茅盾在题为“向持久和平和友好合作的道路前进”的报告（报告全文见第二版）中，分析了这次大会召开时的国际局势，指出了参加大会的代表的广泛性和大会受到的广泛热烈的支持。茅盾在谈了大会的各项重大成就以后，号召全国人民继续努力争取进一步缓和国际局势和保卫世界和平。
    茅盾的报告结束以后，中国出席世界和平大会代表团副团长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通讲话，他叙述了对世界和平大会的感想。
    陈叔通说，赫尔辛基世界和平大会是在和平力量与战争势力进行长期斗争过程中，国际局势出现了新的缓和时机中召开的。因此，它对团结和扩大和平力量以推动和平运动的进一步发展、促使国际局势的进一步缓和，具有重大的意义。出席这次大会的有空前广泛的不同政治、宗教信仰的六十八个国家各阶层社会人士，这再次有力地表明了对国际局势发展日益起着重大作用的和平力量正在一天比一天壮大起来。大会通过自由讨论及交换意见，对当前所有各项重大的国际问题都取得了一致的意见，通过了具有历史意义的宣言和各项建议，充分表达了全世界广大人民的共同愿望和强烈的和平要求。
    陈叔通谈到了不久前在取得了积极成就之后宣告结束的四国政府首脑会议。他说，会议虽然没有能根据苏联一再的建议讨论亚洲局势、特别是台湾地区以及印度支那局势问题，令人感到很大的遗憾，但这次会议已为国际局势的缓和及增进国际间的互信合作，作出了一个良好的开端。我们希望这种协商精神能够保持并扩大，那就会继续促进国际局势缓和下去，使和平事业的维护获得保证。
    陈叔通最后说，赫尔辛基世界和平大会所提出的一切主张是我国人民和世界其他各国人民今后争取和平的重要指标，我们必须用全力来促使这些主张的完全实现。
    茅盾的报告和陈叔通的讲话，受到全场热烈的欢迎，在他们讲话时，人们不断为这次世界和平大会所取得的重大成就热烈鼓掌。
    在大会上，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴也讲了话。他们分别代表全国的工人、青年、妇女，表示完全拥护和支持世界和平大会所通过的宣言和各项决议。
    赖若愚讲话时，首先对世界和平大会的成功，表示热烈的祝贺。他说，中国人民，对于保卫和平负有重大责任，我国社会主义建设事业的每一项成就，都是对于和平事业的贡献。当我们把社会主义社会建设成功的时候，也就是世界和平最有保证的时候。为了保卫和平，对于中国工人阶级来说，最实际的行动就是坚决完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，就是忠实地、模范地执行兵役法，就是积极支援解放台湾的斗争，就是提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。对于中国工会工作者来说，就是更加深入、具体地组织劳动竞赛，就是更加亲切、周到地关心职工群众的生活，就是更加认真地、实实在在地帮助职工群众提高政治觉悟和文化技术水平。中国工人阶级将更加紧密地和全国人民团结起来，建设我们的祖国，保卫世界和平。
    胡克实说，我们青年的确是世界和平队伍中的一支重要力量。因为我们懂得：只要全世界的青年不上战争贩子的当，只要我们把和平战士的责任勇敢地担当起来，战争贩子的一切打算，都是要落空的。因此我们中国青年一定为世界和平大会的宣言、为大会的各项建议的实现而奋斗。
    胡克实说：保卫和平，也就是要保证每个国家的领土和主权的神圣不可侵犯。我们中国青年坚决反对殖民主义，我们中国青年决不会忘记自己的神圣的领土台湾，还为美国侵略势力所庇护的蒋介石卖国集团所盘踞。我们说，我们一定要为解放这一片领土奋斗到底。 　 章蕴说：我们中国人民和中国妇女一向是坚决拥护人民政府的和平外交政策，积极参加世界和平运动并为扩大世界和平力量而奋斗不息。为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，防止和平的敌人企图继续掀起冷战和争取持久和平，我们中国妇女将坚决响应世界和平大会的号召，永远忠实于和平事业，为实现永久和平而奋斗到底。章蕴在发言中并指出，最近召开的世界母亲大会代表了全世界母亲们的要求和愿望，也是与世界和平大会精神完全一致的。它的目的是：“保卫儿童，反对战争，争取实现裁军，增进各国人民之间的友谊”。我们中国妇女愿为实现世界母亲大会的四大号召而努力。同时，将以此作为人类共同的信念，教育子女、儿童，使新中国的新生一代，从幼年时就树立起热爱和平的崇高美德。
    当来自日本、叙利亚、巴西和澳大利亚的和平朋友们应邀讲话时，会场上响起了热烈的掌声。
    日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫说，赫尔辛基大会，在六十八个国家代表参加之下，向全世界的人民作出决议说：各国政府应该努力通过协商来缓和国际紧张局势，在舆论压力日益高涨的基础上，国际间的紧张局势是一定能够得到缓和的。最近四国首脑会议的成功首先证实了这个决议的正确性。
    大山郁夫说，日本人民衷心欢迎世界和平大会，日本人民全面支持赫尔辛基世界和平大会的决议，他们正在要求日本政府开始和中国谈判，使两国的国交正常化。日本人民特别欢迎赫尔辛基大会订八月六日为禁止原子武器和裁减军备的国际性纪念日。为了执行这一项决议，目前正在筹备八月六日在日本的广岛举行一个要求禁止原子武器的国际性大会。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会已经表示准备派遣代表参加广岛的大会。我要在这里对中国人民的这种努力和友谊表示感谢。中日两国的一切和平工作者将和亚洲及全世界的爱好和平的人们肩并肩地站在一起，同心合力，为完全实现赫尔辛基世界和平大会的决议而向前迈进。
    叙利亚和平委员会委员阿赫玛德·阿巴扎接着讲话。他说，在中国，我们看到了你们在和平建设方面所取得的胜利，正如我们曾经看到你们在国际方面所获得的和平胜利一样。
    他说，赫尔辛基世界和平大会所通过的宣言和各项建议，是世界和平力量的伟大胜利，一切爱好和平的人民将支持大会的宣言和各项建议。
    阿巴扎最后高呼：“各国人民的友谊万岁！”“在毛泽东领导下的伟大中国人民万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    巴西代表团团长法尔康代表拉丁美洲各国人民和来我国访问的拉丁美洲各国和平代表在会上讲话。他说，我们来到北京像回到自己家庭里一样，像回到自己的兄弟中间一样。我们回到本国后，将更加坚强地为和平而斗争，因为在中国我们更好地了解到和平事业的意义，我们将把中国人民的和平愿望告诉本国的人民。法尔康说：中国应该得到它在联合国的地位，台湾应该归还中国，拉丁美洲人民坚决支持中国人民的斗争。他并代表拉丁美洲人民向中国人民致敬，祝贺中国人民在争取自己祖国的解放和保卫和平的斗争中获得的成就。
    澳大利亚全国和平理事会副主席威廉·戈兰在会上的讲话中着重指出，我们必须和全世界所有国家的人民一道，共同完成我们这一代所面临的历史任务——这就是从世界上永远消灭战争。我保证澳大利亚的和平运动在这个斗争中完成它的任务，把这一斗争坚持到底，直到最后胜利。
    在这些讲话结束以后，全场一致举手通过了拥护赫尔辛基世界和平大会宣言和各项建议的决议。决议通过时，全场响起经久不息的掌声。
    大会结束以后，由中国杂技团表演了精采的节目。
