Opposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been thoroughly exposed as a major victory for the people of the whole country in their struggle to defend socialist construction. Our current task is to resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and to draw full lessons from this incident. One of the most important lessons we should learn is that we must oppose the tendency of Communist Party members, revolutionary workers, and general revolutionary intellectuals to only care about professional work and neglect politics.

What is politics? Politics is class struggle. Our socialist construction is carried out in a complex and sharp class struggle; with the progress of socialist construction, the class struggle is not easing but becoming more acute. Many facts illustrate this point. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a representative of the reactionary class in the current class struggle in our country. They put forward a set of counter-revolutionary programs through so-called literary and artistic theories, advocating that writers should not ask about politics and oppose literature and art serving politics. They seemed to be only talking about literary and artistic issues on the surface, but in fact, they raised a question with universal significance, which was to make revolutionary workers and revolutionary intellectuals break away from politics. If we do not care about revolutionary politics, it will be easy for counter-revolutionary elements such as Hu Feng to carry out counter-revolutionary political activities; if we do not actively participate in the revolutionary class struggle, it will be easy for counter-revolutionary elements such as Hu Feng to carry out counter-revolutionary class struggle. In fact, some people have been deceived by Hu Feng elements and embarked on the path of breaking away from class struggle, reality, and the masses; counter-revolutionary elements such as Hu Feng have used the weakness of some people neglecting politics to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and even captured them. Therefore, it is extremely necessary for us to raise the issue of opposing the neglect of politics once again today.

In our revolutionary ranks, some people still have incorrect views on the relationship between professional work and politics, and show varying degrees of tendency to neglect politics. First of all, they neglect the political significance of various professional work, and neglect the connection between professional work and politics. In their view, the work they do is only economic work, cultural and educational work, technical work, etc., as if these works have nothing to do with politics. They either simply say "production is politics." They equate production with politics, actually negating the relationship between production struggle and class struggle. They do not understand that at present, in our country, all work serves the general goal of building socialism. Any revolutionary work cannot be separated from class struggle; on the contrary, they are all a link in the class struggle. In a class society, production struggle cannot be separated from class struggle either. Our struggle with hostile classes is carried out through various specific works in the fields of politics, economy, ideology, etc. The class enemy never relaxes their sabotage of any department and any aspect of our work. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique took literature and art as their position, systematically spread anti-Marxist views, and at the same time developed their counter-revolutionary organizations in many of our government agencies, military agencies, cultural and educational agencies, economic agencies, mass organizations, and even within the Communist Party. Isn't this fact enough to make us sober?

Due to neglecting the connection between professional work and politics, coupled with the complacency brought about by victory, many comrades have become politically numb, and their viewpoint on class struggle is very weak. Some department leaders only require their staff to complete tasks and indicators, but do not ask whether the Party's policies have been implemented in the process of completing tasks and indicators, nor do they ask what problems there are in the ideological style of the staff. They neglect the Party's political and ideological leadership in enterprises, and allow the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Some people even think that security work is dispensable, treating political accidents as accidents of responsibility or even natural accidents, without investigation or accountability. In the use and allocation of cadres, some violate the Party's cadre policy of both ability and integrity, only looking at "talent" and not asking about political qualities, resulting in some counter-revolutionary elements mixing into our revolutionary ranks and even the Party organization, and being trusted and promoted. Not long ago, the Jilin Provincial Public Security Bureau arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements in the forestry industry department. One of them, Zheng Dianming, a counter-revolutionary element with six lives on his hands, infiltrated the Bajiazi Forestry Bureau when the forestry department was recruiting workers because the review was not strict. Moreover, because he was "educated" and "eloquent," the administrative leaders of this unit regarded him as an activist, sent him to study and cultivate him, and after he came back, he served as the vice chairman of the trade union. Similar examples exist in other departments as well. If this tendency of only looking at professional work and not looking at politics, neglecting class struggle, is not paid attention to and overcome, it will not only fail to make our professional work go smoothly, but will inevitably open the door wide for the activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

Another manifestation of the tendency to neglect politics is not caring about major domestic and foreign events, and not studying the relationship between major issues in international and domestic life and our daily work. Of course, we hope that many comrades will strive to become experts in their respective fields. But for a Communist Party member and a revolutionary worker, he should not only be an expert proficient in his professional work, but also a politician and a social activist. It is very wrong for a Communist Party member and a working cadre not to care about current affairs and politics. Not long ago, the Supply and Marketing General Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry held a current affairs test among cadres, and nearly one-third of the cadres who participated in the test failed. Many comrades did not even know about some very important events at home and abroad. Some comrades emphasized "being busy with work" and did not read newspapers, or at most read the headlines. Some Communist Party writers are unwilling to read the Party's instructions on various important issues and work, and some comrades are unwilling to participate in political, social, and diplomatic activities of great significance, regarding them as "extra burdens." Some leading comrades do not lead the masses to study current affairs and participate in the country's political life. Workers in some factories in Wuhan once made such criticisms to the leadership: "We talk about production in every meeting, big and small, and we don't care about current affairs and politics. If this continues, our workers will become confused!" This criticism deserves our attention. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary worker should at all times recognize the domestic and international environment we are in, and help the broad masses recognize the domestic and international environment; link their daily work with the Party and the country's current major struggle tasks. In this way, we will not degenerate into short-sighted, opportunistic bureaucrats; our professional work will not be divorced from the current political struggle, but will be able to serve the current political struggle well.

To overcome the tendency to neglect politics, we must also greatly strengthen the study and publicity of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening address at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." Marxism-Leninism is the science that guides us to carry out revolutionary struggle victoriously and to carry out socialist construction victoriously. Precisely because of this, any class enemy, without exception, including the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, always extremely hates Marxism-Leninism. They either openly oppose Marxism-Leninism, or distort Marxism-Leninism while wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism. Their only purpose is to shrink the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism, shrink the ideological position of socialism, and expand the ideological position of the bourgeoisie, so as to disintegrate the revolutionary ranks ideologically. Some of our comrades still do not understand or do not fully understand this truth. Although they also admit the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism in words, they actually lack consciousness and initiative in learning. The Nanning Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guangxi once conducted a report among cadres on criticizing Hu Shi, Hu Feng and other bourgeois idealist thoughts. Some comrades even believed that "I don't engage in literary and artistic work, it has nothing to do with me." These comrades do not understand that the theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism is dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the core of any form of bourgeois thought is the idealist world outlook. Only by seriously studying materialism and striving to master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism can we see problems deeply and far; can we have the ability to identify and defend against all kinds of bourgeois ideological toxins; can we avoid or make fewer mistakes in class struggle and production struggle, and in all work, and make progress and achievements.

At present, the Party committees in many regions are conducting political education to the broad masses of Party members, intellectuals, and people through the Hu Feng incident, and mobilizing people to actively participate in this fierce struggle. This is absolutely necessary. However, some Party organizations still do not attach enough importance to this serious struggle, which must be corrected quickly. We must use great efforts to lead this major struggle, so that in the future, on this basis, we can more systematically lead and organize Party members, staff, and intellectuals to study Marxist-Leninist theory, study policies, and study current affairs and politics; while promoting them to study professional work and master professional work, we must guide them to care about politics and actively participate in the country's political life. We must use the reality of class struggle and historical lessons to continuously improve the class struggle viewpoint and political vigilance of every Communist Party member and the broad masses of people.

    反对忽视政治的倾向
    胡风反革命集团被彻底揭露是全国人民为保卫社会主义建设而斗争的一个重大的胜利。我们当前的任务是要坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，并从这个事件吸取充分的经验教训。我们应当吸取的最重要的教训之一，就是必须在共产党员、革命工作人员和一般革命知识分子中间反对只顾业务、忽视政治的倾向。
    什么是政治？政治就是阶级斗争。我国的社会主义建设是在复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争中进行的；随着社会主义建设的进展，阶级斗争不是缓和而是更加尖锐了。许多事实说明了这一点。胡风反革命集团就是我国当前阶级斗争中反动阶级的代表。他们通过所谓文艺理论提出一套反革命的纲领，主张作家不问政治，反对文艺为政治服务。他们表面上好像只是谈的文艺问题，实际上是提出了一个带有普遍意义的问题，是要使革命工作人员和革命知识分子都脱离政治。我们如果不过问革命的政治，就便于胡风等反革命分子进行反革命的政治活动；我们如果不积极参加革命的阶级斗争，就便于胡风等反革命分子进行反革命的阶级斗争。事实上，已经有一些人受了胡风分子的欺骗，走上了脱离阶级斗争、脱离实际、脱离群众的路子；胡风等反革命分子就利用了某些人忽视政治的弱点进行反革命活动，甚至把他们俘掳过去。因此，我们今天再一次提出反对忽视政治的问题就有极大的必要性。
    在我们革命队伍中有一些人至今对业务同政治的关系还有不正确的看法，表现了不同程度的忽视政治的倾向。他们首先是忽视各项业务工作的政治意义，忽视业务同政治的联系。在他们看来，自己所做的工作只是经济工作、文教工作、技术工作，等等，好像这些工作同政治没有关系。他们或者干脆说“生产就是政治”。他们把生产和政治等同起来，实际上否定了生产斗争跟阶级斗争的关系。他们不了解，目前在我们的国家里，各项工作都是服务于建设社会主义这个总的目标。任何革命工作都不能同阶级斗争分割开来，恰恰相反，它们都是阶级斗争的一环。在阶级社会中，生产斗争也不能离开阶级斗争。我们同敌对阶级进行的斗争正是通过政治、经济、思想等各种领域的各项具体工作而展开的。阶级敌人也是从来不放松对我们的任何部门、任何方面的工作进行破坏的。胡风反革命集团以文艺为阵地，系统地传播反马克思主义的观点，同时在我们的不少政府机关、军事机关、文教机关、经济机关、群众团体乃至共产党内发展他们的反革命组织，这个事实难道还不足以使我们清醒吗？
    由于忽视业务同政治的联系，加上因胜利而来的骄傲自满情绪，就使得许多同志在政治上麻痹起来，阶级斗争的观点十分薄弱。有些部门的领导者只要求工作人员完成任务和指标，却不问在完成任务和指标的过程中是否贯彻了党的政策，也不问工作人员的思想作风有什么问题。他们忽视党在企业中的政治思想领导，听任资产阶级思想的侵蚀。有的人还认为保卫工作可有可无，把政治事故当作责任事故甚至自然事故，不查不究。在使用和配备干部方面，有的违背党的德才兼备的干部政策，只看“才能”，不问政治品质，结果让一些反革命分子混进我们的革命队伍甚至党组织中来，并且受到信任和提拔。不久以前吉林省公安机关在森林工业部门中逮捕了一批反革命分子，其中一个有六条人命血债的反革命分子郑殿铭，就是乘森林部门招募工人时审查不严混入八家子森林工业局的，而且因为他“有文化”、“能说会道”，这个单位的行政领导人员就把他当作积极分子，送去学习培养，回来后便担任了工会副主席。像这样的例子在其他部门同样也有。这种只看业务、不看政治，忽视阶级斗争的倾向如果不注意加以克服，就不仅不能使我们的业务工作顺利进行，而且必然会给反革命分子的活动大开方便之门。忽视政治的倾向的另一种表现，是不关心国内外大事，不研究国际、国内生活中的重大问题同我们日常工作的关系。我们当然希望许多同志都要努力使自己成为本行业务的专家。但是对于一个共产党员和革命工作者来说，他不仅应当是精通本行业务的能手，同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家。如果作为共产党员和工作干部而不关心时事政治那是很不应该的。不久以前轻工业部供销总局在干部中举行过一次时事测验，参加测验的干部有将近三分之一不及格。不少同志对国内外一些十分重大的事件也不知道。有的同志强调“工作忙”而不看报纸，或者至多看看标题。有的共产党员作家不愿看党关于各种重要问题和工作的指示文件，有的同志不愿参加具有重大意义的政治活动、社会活动、外交活动，把它们看成“额外负担”。有的领导同志不领导群众学习时事，参加国家的政治生活。武汉有的工厂的工人就曾向领导方面提出过这样的批评：
  “我们每天大会小会都谈生产，对时事政治不关心，这样下去我们工人就变成糊涂蛋了！”这个批评很值得我们注意。我们每一个共产党员和革命工作者在任何时候都应当认清我们所处的国内和国际环境，并帮助广大群众认清国内和国际环境；把自己的日常工作同党和国家当前的重大斗争任务联系起来。这样，我们才不致于堕落成为鼠目寸光、只图眼前利益的事务主义者；我们的业务才不致脱离当前的政治斗争，而能够很好地为当前的政治斗争服务。
    要克服忽视政治的倾向，还必须大大加强马克思列宁主义的学习和宣传。毛泽东同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词中说：“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”马克思列宁主义是指导我们胜利地进行革命斗争和胜利地进行社会主义建设的科学。正是因为这样，任何阶级敌人，胡风反革命集团也不例外，总是极端仇视马克思列宁主义。他们或者公开地反对马克思列宁主义，或者披着马克思列宁主义的外衣来歪曲马克思列宁主义。他们的目的只有一个：缩小马克思列宁主义的思想阵地，缩小社会主义的思想阵地，扩大资产阶级的思想阵地，以便从思想上来瓦解革命队伍。我们有些同志还不懂得或不完全懂得这个道理。他们在口头上虽然也承认学习马克思列宁主义的重要性，实际上对学习却缺乏自觉、缺乏主动。中共广西南宁市委曾在干部中进行关于批判胡适、胡风等资产阶级唯心主义思想的报告，有的同志竟认为“我不搞文艺工作，它同我没有啥关系”。这些同志不了解马克思列宁主义的理论基础是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，而任何形式的资产阶级思想的核心就是唯心主义世界观。只有认真学习唯物主义，努力掌握马克思列宁主义这个思想武器，我们看问题才能看得深、看得远；才有识别和防御各种各样的资产阶级思想毒素的能力；才能够在阶级斗争和生产斗争中、在各项工作中不犯或少犯错误，并取得进步和成就。
    目前许多地区的党委正在通过胡风事件向广大党员、知识分子和人民群众进行政治教育，并动员人们积极参加这场激烈的斗争。这是完全必要的。但是有的党组织对于这一严重斗争仍然重视不够，这就必须迅速纠正。我们要用大力来领导进行这一重大的斗争，以便今后在这个基础上更加有系统地领导和组织党员、工作人员和知识分子的马克思列宁主义的理论学习、政策学习和时事政治学习；在推动他们钻研业务，掌握业务的同时，要引导他们关心政治，积极参加国家的政治生活。我们要用阶级斗争的现实和历史的教训，不断地提高每一个共产党员和广大群众的阶级斗争观点和政治警惕性。
