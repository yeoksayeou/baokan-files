    苏联代表团提出关于欧洲现有国家集团之间的条约的基本原则的建议
    新华社日内瓦二十二日电　苏联政府代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁二十一日在四国政府首脑会议上提出的建议：关于欧洲现有国家集团之间的条约的基本原则。建议全文如下：
    本着巩固和平的愿望，并且确认有必要用一切办法来促进国际紧张局势的缓和以及在国与国关系中建立信任。
    苏联、美国、法国和联合王国政府商定，为了维持欧洲的和平，参加北大西洋公约和西欧联盟的国家一方同参加华沙条约的国家一方之间应该缔结一项条约。条约可以根据下列原则：
    一、参加北大西洋公约和巴黎协定的国家一方以及参加华沙条约的国家一方保证不使用武装力量来互相对付。这个保证不应该妨害联合国宪章第五十一条所规定的，各国在遭受武装攻击时实行单独的或集体的自卫的权利。
    二、参加本条约的国家保证在它们之间发生了可能成为对维持欧洲和平的威胁的任何分歧或争论时互相进行协商。
    三、本条约属于暂时性质，在由关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的条约所代替以前有效。
