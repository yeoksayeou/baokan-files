    Zhejiang Promotes the Use of Uncolored Soy Sauce to Reduce Grain Consumption
    Beginning in July, the grain department of Zhejiang Province has been promoting the production of uncolored soy sauce (soy sauce without added coloring) among sauce and pickle factories throughout the province. Preliminary estimates suggest that fully implementing the production of uncolored soy sauce will save the country 820,000 jin of grain from July to December.
    Shaoxing City, a major soy sauce producing area, has already convened a specialized conference for sauce and pickle factories to specifically study the operational methods and specifications for modifying soy sauce production. Last year, the modification to produce uncolored soy sauce was piloted in Jinhua City with very good results. It proved that the modified uncolored soy sauce not only does not affect quality but also increases the fresh juice yield and reduces costs, while also saving grain for the country.

    浙江推行原色酱油少用粮食
    浙江省粮食部门七月份开始在全省酱园业中推行生产原色酱油（不搀色的酱油）。据初步估计，全面推行生产原色酱油后，从七月到十二月份，将为国家节约八十二万斤粮食。
    酱油主要产地绍兴市已召开了一次酱园专业会议，具体研究改制酱油的操作方法和规格。去年，改制原色酱油就已在金华市重点试行，效果很好，证明改制后的原色酱油不但不影响质量，而且鲜汁增加，成本降低，还为国家节约了粮食。
