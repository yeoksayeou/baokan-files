    The Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building
　  Should Correct the Mistake of "Living off School Staffing"
    Reader Xiao Miao wrote a letter reflecting that in March of this year, the Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building set up a "Data Distribution Group" of three people in their affiliated Beijing Industrial Cadre School—the staffing was counted as the school's, the expenses were paid by the school, but the work they did was entirely for the Industrial Education Department. This phenomenon has occurred more than once in the Industrial Education Department. In the past, they also placed the staffing of the department's compiling personnel in the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School. This is a practice of "living off school staffing" and "laying an ambush for the higher authorities," which is very wrong.
    We sent reader Xiao Miao's letter to the First Ministry of Machine Building to verify the facts and solicit their opinions. The Industrial Education Department wrote back, explaining that they had merged the original compilation office of the department with the compilation office of the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School, streamlined some personnel, and formed a compilation group of the school, which was responsible for the work of both the department and the school. "This was done to tighten staffing and save manpower." As for the establishment of the Data Distribution Group, it was "because the quantity of teaching materials and mechanical industrial education publications in the department was quite large, and it would be difficult to handle it in a decentralized manner by various business sections and departments. Also, because the original compilation office was abolished and merged with the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School, ... the Data Distribution Group was set up in the Beijing Industrial Cadre School to facilitate work contact."
    In short, they believe that this approach is necessary and there is nothing inappropriate about it.
    In order to clarify the true situation, we conducted a further investigation into this issue and proved that the explanation of the Industrial Education Department is not satisfactory.
    It is true that the Industrial Education Department transferred some people when it merged the translation institution into the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School. However, this was because the department's compilation group had too many people and too little work at that time, and even without the merger, it should have been transferred. Most of the work of the compilation group of the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School after the merger belonged to the Industrial Education Department, such as translating and proofreading the teaching syllabuses of secondary technical schools, technical worker schools, and foreman training classes affiliated to the First Ministry of Machine Building, etc. The Industrial Education Department is an administrative unit, and the school is a public institution. Placing the department's translation personnel in the school is actually expanding its own staffing in disguise. It is understood that a responsible comrade of the Industrial Education Department once said explicitly at a meeting: "Eating the school's food and doing the work of the Industrial Education Department is just the way it is."
    As for their establishment of the Data Distribution Group, it is also unnecessary. This group does not have much regular work. It is only busy for one day each time a publication is issued. On weekdays, several people have nothing to do. Can setting up this group in the Beijing Industrial Cadre School really make "work contact more convenient"? No, quite the contrary. The comrades of this group said: the leadership relationship is in the secretariat of the Industrial Education Department, and the departments that are frequently contacted are also in the department, but the group is located in the suburbs more than twenty miles from the city, in a school that has nothing to do with distribution work. As a result, the publications and materials to be distributed are printed in the city and then sent to the outside of the city, packaged outside the city, and then transported to the city; as a result, some work problems have to be solved in the city, and sometimes even to get a seal, they have to travel more than forty miles back and forth. Obviously, setting up the Data Distribution Group in the Beijing Industrial Cadre School is harmful and unhelpful to the work. May we ask what the Industrial Education Department wants to do this for if not to "live off school staffing"?
    According to our investigation, the Industrial Education Department has other practices of "living off school staffing." The Beijing Industrial Cadre School has been "eaten" of its staffing for a long time and on a large scale, with as many as thirty people at most, and currently there are still more than ten people. These personnel have nothing to do with the school's work, and the school bears all the supplies. For example, some personnel transferred by the department to study, although they no longer belong to the department's staffing, are notified by the department to the school to bear the supplies.
    The Beijing Industrial Cadre School has raised objections to the above practices, and some staff members of the department have also raised objections. However, the leaders of the department "persuaded" those who raised objections to agree with the department's erroneous practices, saying that "it is not impossible to have the staffing in the school and do the work of the Industrial Education Department." This practice has not been criticized and corrected in the reorganization work.
    We believe that the practice of "living off school staffing" and the attitude towards the opinions of the masses of the Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building are both wrong. The First Ministry of Machine Building should inspect and deal with this issue.　　　The People's Daily Readers' Letters Department

### 第一机械工业部工业教育司  应该纠正“吃学校编制”的错误

    第一机械工业部工业教育司
　  应该纠正“吃学校编制”的错误
    读者小苗来信反映：今年三月，第一机械工业部工业教育司在他们所属的北京工业干部学校设了一个三个人的“资料发行小组”——编制算是学校的，开支由学校出，做的工作却完全是工业教育司的。这种现象在工业教育司出现已经不止一次了，过去他们也曾将司里编译人员的编制放到北京机器制造学校去。这是一种“吃学校编制”、“向上级打埋伏”的做法，是十分错误的。
    我们把读者小苗的这封来信送请第一机械工业部核对事实，并征询他们的意见。工业教育司来信，说明了他们把司里原来的编译室和北京机器制造学校的编译室合并，精简了一部分人员，成为学校的编译组，负担司里和学校两方面的工作，“这样做是为了紧缩编制，节约人力”。至于成立资料发行小组，是“因为司里教材资料和机械工业教育的发行的数量相当多，分散了由各业务科和各处去办，就有一定的困难。又因原编译室撤销和北京机器制造学校合并，……所以将资料发行小组设在北京工业干部学校，工作联系较方便”。
    总之，他们认为这样的做法是必要的，没有什么不妥当的地方。
    为了弄清真实情况，我们对这个问题作了进一步的调查，证明工业教育司的说明是不能令人满意的。
    工业教育司在把翻译机构并入北京机器制造学校的时候，调出了一些人，这是事实。但是，这是因为司里的编译组当时人员过多，工作较少，就是不合并也是应该抽调的。合并后的北京机器制造学校编译组的工作，大部分是属于工业教育司的，像翻译和校对第一机械工业部所属中等技术学校、技工学校和工长训练班的教学大纲等等。工业教育司是个行政单位，学校是个事业单位，把司里的翻译人员放在学校里，实际上是变相扩大自己的编制。据了解，工业教育司的一位负责同志曾在一次会议上明白地说过：“吃学校的饭，做工教司的工作，就是这么一回事。”
    至于他们设立资料发行小组也是没有必要的，这个小组的经常工作不多，只有在每次发刊物的时候，才忙一天，平日几个人就没事可做。把这个小组设在北京工业干部学校真的可以使“工作联系较方便”吗？不，恰恰相反。这个小组的同志说：领导关系在工业教育司秘书科，经常联系的部门也在司里，而小组却设在离城二十余里的郊区，设在和发行工作毫无关系的一个学校里。于是，要发行的刊物和资料在城里印好后送到城外，在城外包好后再运到城里；于是，要解决一些工作问题就得进城，甚至有时为了盖个印章也要往返四十多里。显然，资料发行小组设在北京工业干部学校对工作是有害而无利的。试问工业教育司要这么做，不是为了
  “吃学校编制”又是为了什么呢？
    据我们调查，工业教育司还有其他“吃学校编制”的做法。北京工业干部学校就长期而大量地被
  “吃”着编制，人数最多时达三十多个，目前也还有十多个。这些人员，工作都同学校无关，供给都由学校负担。如司里一些调出学习的人员，虽然已不属于司的编制，但却由司里通知学校负担供给。
    对于以上做法，北京工业干部学校曾提出意见，司里有些工作人员也提过意见。但是司的领导人员却“说服”提意见的人同意司里的错误做法，说什么“编制在学校，做工业教育司的事并无不可”。这种做法，在整编工作中还没有受到批判和纠正。
    我们认为，第一机械工业部工业教育司这种“吃学校编制”的做法和对待群众意见的态度都是错误的。第一机械工业部应该对这个问题进行检查和处理。　　　本报读者来信部
