Zhejiang Salt Region Achieves a Bumper Harvest in the Off-Season
		Dù Bǎozēng

	Along the 1,300-li coastline of Zhejiang Province, stretching from Hangzhou Bay in the north to Zhenxiaguan in the south, there are more than 1.18 million mu of salt fields, distributed across thirteen counties and one hundred and twenty townships. These salt fields produce approximately five million dan of salt annually, meeting the needs of the province and parts of other provinces for daily consumption, industrial raw materials, agricultural seed selection, and the curing of fishery products and other local specialties. Income from salt production and fisheries is the primary source of revenue for residents of coastal Zhejiang, with over 140,000 salt farmers in the province making their living from salt production. In the several years since liberation, with the active support of the People's Government, salt farmers have launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement in salt production, and salt production has gradually increased. This year, the liberation of all enemy-occupied islands along the Zhejiang coast in the first half of the year has boosted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of salt farmers for mutual aid, cooperation, and production. In the past, the period from January to May and October to December were the off-season for salt production in Zhejiang's salt regions. However, this year, from January to May, salt production has already completed 101.56 percent of the state plan for the same period, an increase of 85 percent over the same period last year and an increase of 10 percent over the highest historical output in the same period of 1953.
	The main reason for this year's increased production in the salt regions is the emphasis and strengthening of production leadership by the Party committees. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a work conference on salt regions this spring, systematically studying and clarifying the guidelines and specific policies related to mutual aid and cooperation in salt production. The Party committees and administrative departments in various salt regions shifted the focus of leadership to production centered on mutual aid and cooperation, establishing and improving certain specialized management institutions. On the basis of streamlining its organization and improving work efficiency, the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau improved its leadership style, and dispatched about one-third of its staff to form work groups, led by leading comrades, to go deep into key salt regions, coordinating with local efforts to rectify and consolidate salt production cooperatives and promote production. This year, the state also issued more than 300,000 yuan in production loans and relief funds, providing strong support for salt production. Among the 274 salt production cooperatives in the province, approximately 80 percent have increased production on their original basis by leveraging the advantages of unified management. For example, the Shuguang Salt Production Cooperative in the Andong Salt Field, in the face of frequent rainfall this spring, uniformly deployed labor, actively excavated tuotou mud and louji mud, uniformly adjusted brine sources within the cooperative, and promoted mud-salt boards to increase salinity, overcoming the difficulties of mud shortage and brine shortage that were insurmountable under individual production methods. As a result, the average yield per salt pan in the 24 cooperatives in this salt field was 15 percent higher than the average yield of the entire field. The Xinlong Salt Production Cooperative in the Yuhuan Salt Field, under the favorable conditions of unified management, purchased approximately one-third more ash material than last year, and adopted advanced operating techniques such as "spreading cold ash" and "splashing double water." As a result, although the field had eight fewer sunning days in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, eight of the thirteen cooperatives had outputs exceeding last year by more than 10 percent. Driven by the salt production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, production preparations such as water conservancy construction and laying mud slag, which used to be carried out in the spring, were completed approximately 50 percent ahead of schedule in the winter of last year. On this basis, advanced production experiences such as "closing the tides to nourish salinity," "draining freshwater after rain," "thin scraping and frequent picking," "pushing ash to the edge," "covering ash piles," "separating strong and weak brine," and "lifting the boards early, collecting salt late, and appropriately adding brine" were also promoted in accordance with local conditions, utilizing natural conditions and maximizing the utilization of equipment and tools, providing a guarantee for increased production. As a result of over fulfilling the production plan, the actual income of the salt farmers has also increased, and their lives have greatly improved. From January to May, the average income of each salt farmer in the province increased by approximately 80 percent compared to the same period last year, with Andong salt farmers increasing by approximately 112 percent per person and Yuhuan salt farmers increasing by approximately 127 percent per person; and the difficulties in life brought about by last year's poor harvest for some salt farmers were overcome.
	In order to further improve the salt production work during the peak season this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau convened a salt production inspection meeting in mid-June. Based on the current situation, the meeting proposed that the tasks for the second half of the year are: to fully consolidate the salt production cooperatives, strengthen leadership over mutual aid teams, unite individual salt farmers, launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive for a bumper harvest in salt production for the whole year. It was also decided to immediately launch a mass summary and evaluation movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in all salt regions of the province. On the basis of summarizing the production of the previous stage, further improve the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of salt farmers, set off a high tide of peak season production, and strive to overfulfill the peak season and annual salt production plans.

    浙江盐区的淡季丰收
    杜保曾
    在浙江省北自杭州湾南到镇下关长达一千三百里的海岸线上，共有盐田一百一十八万多公亩，分布在十三个县、一百二十个乡。这些盐田每年产盐量在五百万担左右，供应本省和省外部分地区人民日常食用、工业原料、农业选种以及腌制渔产品和其他土特产等的需要。盐业和渔业生产的收入，是浙江沿海地区居民的主要收入，全省以制盐为生的盐民计有十四万多人。解放几年来，盐民在人民政府的积极扶植下，开展了盐业生产互助合作运动，盐业生产逐步提高。今年上半年，浙江沿海敌占岛屿全部解放，鼓舞了广大盐民群众互助合作和生产的积极性。往年，浙江盐区一至五月和十至十二月为产盐的淡季，可是今年一至五月份产盐已完成了同期的国家计划的百分之一百零一点五六，比去年同期增产百分之八十五，比历史上产量最高的一九五三年同期产量也增加了百分之十。
    今年盐区增产的主要原因是由于党委对生产领导的重视和加强。中共浙江省委员会在今年春季召开了盐区工作会议，对有关盐业生产互助合作的方针和具体政策作了系统的研究和明确的交代。各盐区的党委和行政部门把领导重点转向以互助合作为中心，搞好生产，建立并健全了一定的专管机构。浙江省盐务管理局在通过整编机构、提高工作效率的基础上，改进了领导作风，抽调了约三分之一的工作人员组成了工作组，由领导同志率领，深入重点盐区，配合当地整顿、巩固盐业生产合作社的工作，推动了生产。今年国家还发放了三十多万元的生产贷款和救济款，有力地支援了盐业生产。全省二百七十四个盐业生产合作社中，约有百分之八十由于发挥了统一经营的优越性，在原基础上增加了生产。如庵东盐场的曙光等盐业生产合作社，在春季多雨的情况下，统一调配劳力，积极挖掘坨头泥、漏基泥，社内统一调剂卤源，并推广泥盐板，提高卤度，克服了个体生产方式下无法克服的断泥缺卤的困难；因而这个盐场二十四个社每块盐板的平均产量比全场平均产量高出百分之十五。玉环盐场的新龙等盐业生产合作社在统一经营的有利条件下，添购的灰料约比去年增加三分之一以上，并采用了“摊冷灰”、“泼双水”等先进操作技术，因而该场在第一季度中虽比上年同期减少八个开晒天，但十三个社中有八个社产量高过上年百分之十以上。在盐业生产合作社、互助组的带动下，往年须在春季进行的兴修水利、挑铺泥渣等生产准备工作，在去年冬季即已提前完成约百分之五十。在这个基础上，还因地制宜地推广了“关潮养咸”、“雨后排淡”、“薄刮勤挑”、“灰推到边”、“灰堆加盖”、“浓淡分沥”、“早扛板、迟收盐、适当加卤”等先进生产经验，利用自然条件，发挥设备和工具的利用率，为增产提供了保证。由于超额完成了生产计划，盐民群众的实际收入也随之增加，盐民的生活大大地改善了。一至五月份全省每一盐民平均收入约比上年同期增加百分之八十，庵东盐民每人增加约百分之一百一十二，玉环盐民每人约增加百分之一百二十七；并克服了部分盐民因去年歉产而带来的生活困难。
    为了进一步做好今年旺季盐业生产工作，浙江省盐务管理局在六月中旬召开了盐业生产检查会议。根据当前情况，会议提出下半年的任务是：全力巩固盐业生产合作社，加强对互助组的领导，团结个体盐民，开展增产节约运动，力争全年盐业生产丰收。并决定立即在全省各个盐区，以互助合作为中心，开展一个群众性的总结评比运动。在总结前一阶段生产的基础上，进一步提高广大盐民的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性，掀起旺季生产的热潮，力争超额完成旺季和全年盐业生产计划。
