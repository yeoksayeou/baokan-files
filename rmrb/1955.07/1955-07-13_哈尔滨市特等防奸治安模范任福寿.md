Harbin City's Special-Class Anti-Espionage and Security Model, Ren Fushou, a worker at the state-owned Harbin Particleboard Factory, has reported 51 pieces of information related to sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries and other criminals in the past two years. Currently, his model deeds have been made into a comic strip and are being exhibited at the Harbin City Criminal Offense Exhibition.

As early as 1953, when Harbin City held its first Anti-Espionage and Security Model Representative Conference, Ren Fushou won the title of First-Class Anti-Espionage and Security Model for working with residents of his neighborhood to report counter-revolutionaries. Later, he was elected as a people's representative of the Guxiang District of Harbin City and served as the deputy director of the street's security and defense committee. He became even more attentive to the security and defense work of the masses. He frequently educated residents on revolutionary vigilance, and residents would report any suspicious situations to him at any time.

During the Dragon Boat Festival in 1954, Ren Fushou heard from a fellow villager from Shandong Province that he had recently seen a man in a weaving factory who had been the head of the "Homecoming Corps" of the Kuomintang in his hometown in Shandong. Based on this clue, he stayed up all night, neglecting sleep and food, to investigate the whereabouts of this person and learn about his past actions. Later, he finally learned from a fellow villager that this person was originally a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts and had fled to Mudanjiang City to open a grocery store. Therefore, he immediately reported to the public security organs and persuaded his fellow villager to assist the public security organs in arresting this fugitive counter-revolutionary in Mudanjiang City.

Once, Ren Fushou's neighbor had a "guest" who was said to be a "handicraft weaver." This "guest" never went out all day long and always dodged when he saw people. This situation once again attracted Ren Fushou's attention, so he often went to this neighbor's house to visit and observe the person's actions. One day, this neighbor entrusted Ren Fushou to help the "guest" register his household. Ren Fushou took the opportunity to question him about his origins. Ren Fushou carefully remembered every word of this person, and then cross-examined it with some other neighbors. As a result, he found that many of the things this person said at different times were inconsistent. Ren Fushou reported all the suspicious actions of this person in detail to the public security police station. After a thorough investigation by the public security organs, it was confirmed that this person was a leading counter-revolutionary "Homecoming Corps" element who had fled from Shandong Province under a false name and had killed our rural cadres and peasant activists in the land reform struggle. In October 1954, the public security organs arrested this counter-revolutionary criminal according to law.

It is in this way that Ren Fushou closely watches the activities of all hidden counter-revolutionary elements with a high degree of vigilance. At the Second Harbin City Anti-Espionage and Security Model Representative Conference held this spring, he was honorably selected as a special-class anti-espionage and security model for the entire city.

    哈尔滨市特等防奸治安模范任福寿
    哈尔滨市特等防奸治安模范、地方国营哈尔滨刨花板厂工人任福寿，两年来检举了五十一件关于反革命分子和其他犯罪分子进行破坏活动的材料。现在，他的模范事迹被画成连环画，在最近举行的哈尔滨市刑事犯罪案件展览会上进行展览。
    早在一九五三年哈尔滨市举行首届防奸治安模范代表会议的时候，任福寿就因为同本街居民一起检举反革命分子而获得了一等防奸治安模范的称号。以后，他被选为哈尔滨市顾乡区的人民代表，又担任了街道治安保卫委员会副主任，他对群众治安保卫工作就更加重视起来。他经常向居民进行革命警惕性的教育，居民们遇到可疑的情况也都随时向他反映。
    一九五四年端午节的时候，任福寿听一个山东省同乡说，不久前在一个织布工厂里看见一个在山东老家当过国民党“还乡团”团长的人。根据这一线索，他便废寝忘食地连夜出去调查这个人的下落，了解这个人过去的行为。后来终于从一个同乡那里了解到这个人原来是血债累累的反革命分子，并且已潜逃到牡丹江市去开杂货铺了。于是，他立刻向公安机关报告，并说服了他的同乡协助公安机关到牡丹江市逮捕了这个潜逃的反革命分子。
    有一次，任福寿的邻居家来了“客人”，据说是“手工织布匠”。这个“客人”成天不出门，见人总是躲躲闪闪的。这个情况又引起了任福寿的注意，他便随时到这个邻居家去串门，观察这个人的行动。有一天，这家邻居委托任福寿帮助“客人”上户口，任福寿就趁机会盘问了他的来历。任福寿用心牢牢地记住这个人的每一句话，然后又和其他一些邻居们对证，结果发现这个人先后说的许多话都不一致。任福寿便把这个人的一切可疑行动详细地报告给公安派出所。经过公安机关严密侦察后，证实这个人是从山东省化名潜逃来的反革命的“还乡团”首要分子，曾杀害过我农村干部和土地改革斗争中的农民积极分子。一九五四年十月间，公安机关依法逮捕了这个反革命罪犯。
    任福寿就是这样以高度的警惕性密切注视着一切暗藏的反革命分子的活动。在今年春天举行的哈尔滨市第二届防奸治安模范代表会议上，他曾经光荣地被选为全市的特等防奸治安模范。
