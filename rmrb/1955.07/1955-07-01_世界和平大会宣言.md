　　World Peace Congress Declaration
    Thanks to the efforts of public opinion, the heads of the four major powers will meet for the first time in a divided world in ten years. They bear a huge responsibility for the expectations of the whole world. Their primary duty is to overcome mutual distrust.
    The World Peace Congress, which brought together representatives from sixty-eight countries, established the belief that despite deep divisions and different views, agreement can still be reached on many important issues, and negotiations can now resolve many problems.
    World public opinion has now risen up against the policy of strength, against military blocs, against the arms race and the grave danger of atomic war. The Geneva Accords, the end of the Indochina War, the Bandung Conference, the neutrality of Austria solemnly fixed by treaty, the Belgrade Declaration – all these are the fruits of the awakening of public opinion reflected in the attitudes of governments.
    On the issues of disarmament and atomic weapons, which have been deadlocked in the past due to insurmountable differences of opinion, views are now so close that reaching an agreement is simply a matter of sincerity.
    On the issue of security, the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference show that peaceful cooperation between countries with different systems on the entire continent can be based on the propositions declared by China and India.
    The Helsinki Congress has shown that if the Four Powers Conference takes public opinion into account, it must make itself the first stage in building a new Europe that guarantees the security of all European countries and sets them on the path of close economic and cultural cooperation. To build such a Europe, it is necessary to restore Germany's unity, not allow it to join any military alliances, and ensure that it does not revive militarism.
    In the same spirit, the Four Powers Conference must be prepared to negotiate the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Chinese island of Taiwan (Formosa). The conference must ensure strict compliance with the Geneva Accords on Indochina. The conference must make the United Nations a global organization by welcoming the People's Republic of China into the United Nations.
    However, the forces seeking to wage the Cold War still exist, and they oppose the gathering of the Four Powers. The Helsinki Congress calls on world public opinion to rise up against these forces and support the negotiators.
    If peace-loving forces dedicated to the same goal – especially peace movements and the great political organizations that believe in Christian doctrines or social democracy – unite and act together to dispel distrust and defend peace, the cause of peace can finally triumph.
    The contradictions in the world can be resolved step by step, and the hopes of the people of all countries can be realized.

　　世界和平大会宣言
    由于舆论界的努力，十年来四大国首脑将第一次在一个分裂的世界上进行会晤。他们对全世界的期望负有巨大的责任。他们的首要职责是克服相互间的不信任。
    使六十八个国家的代表聚于一堂的世界和平大会确立了这样的信念：尽管有很深的分歧，尽管看法不同，在许多重要的问题上仍然能够达成协议，谈判在现在能够解决许多问题。
    世界舆论现在已经奋起反对实力政策，反对军事集团，反对军备竞赛和原子战争的严重危险。日内瓦协议、印度支那战争的结束、万隆会议、用条约庄严地固定下来的奥地利的中立、贝尔格莱德宣言——所有这一切都是在各国政府的态度中反映了出来的舆论的觉醒的成果。
    在过去一直因为难以消除的意见分歧而陷于僵局的裁减军备和原子武器问题上，现在观点已如此接近，以至获得协议只是一个诚意的问题了。
    在安全问题上，万隆会议通过的原则表明，在整个大陆上，不同制度的国家之间的和平合作，能够以中国和印度所宣布的主张为基础。
    赫尔辛基大会已经表明，如果四大国会议考虑到舆论，它就必须使自己成为建立一个保障欧洲所有国家安全、并且使它们走上密切的经济和文化合作道路的新欧洲的第一阶段。要建立这样一个欧洲，就必须恢复德国的统一，不使它参加任何军事同盟，保证它不复活军国主义。
    本着同样的精神，四大国会议必须准备以谈判方式使外国军队撤出中国岛屿台湾（福摩萨）。会议必须使关于印度支那的日内瓦协定得到严格遵守。会议必须使联合国组织具有世界性质，办法就是欢迎中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    但是，要进行冷战的势力仍然存在，他们反对四大国聚会。赫尔辛基大会呼吁世界各国舆论起来反对这种势力，支持谈判者。
    如果致力于同样目的的爱好和平的力量——特别是拥护和平的运动以及信仰基督教教义或者社会民主主义的巨大的政治组织——团结一致行动起来，驱散不信任和捍卫和平，和平事业就能够最后取得胜利。
    世界上的矛盾能够一步步地得到解决，各国人民的希望能够得到胜利。
