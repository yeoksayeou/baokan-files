Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st: News from Paris: The Chinese Art Troupe's performances in Paris successfully concluded on June 29th.

The art troupe performed a total of eighteen shows in Paris, with an audience of 45,000 people. This performance created a deep impression among the French public and became a central topic of discussion for Parisians.

Every performance by the art troupe was sold out. Due to audience demand, the theater had to sell "standing room" tickets, so the staircases and aisles of the theater were packed with people. Among the audience, many people traveled from afar specifically to Paris. Every program performed by the art troupe was warmly appreciated by the audience, and sometimes the performers had to take curtain calls more than forty times.

The Chinese Art Troupe's performances are being filmed in color in Paris. Afterwards, the art troupe will travel to Belgium and the Netherlands for performance visits.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd: The Chinese Art Troupe held a press conference in Paris on the 1st. More than one hundred people attended the press conference, including reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as theater and music critics from Paris.

Zhang Zhixiang, head of the Chinese Art Troupe, delivered a speech at the press conference. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the organizers of the Paris International Theater Festival, French cultural and artistic figures, and all the people of Paris. He congratulated the growing friendly relations between Chinese and French cultural and artistic circles, and expressed his hope that he would soon be able to welcome outstanding representatives of French artists in the capital of People's China.

    艺术团的每场演出都是满座。由于观众的要求，剧院不得不出售“站票”，因此剧场的楼梯和通道上都挤满了人。在观众中间，有许多人是特别从远处赶到巴黎来的。艺术团演出的每一个节目都受到观众的热烈赞赏，有时候，演员们要谢幕四十多次。
    中国艺术团的表演正在巴黎摄制成彩色影片，在此以后，艺术团将前往比利时和荷兰作访问演出。
