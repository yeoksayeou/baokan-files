　　Strive to Achieve This Year's Production Plan for Oil Crops
　　According to the national plan, China's oil production this year should increase by about one-third compared to last year. However, this year's spring planting task has not been completed. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the summer sowing work and do our best to increase the yield per unit area to strive to complete the national plan.
　　The reason why the spring oil crop planting plan was not completed this year was due to the impact of drought in some areas; in most areas, it was because rural workers and farmers did not fully realize its importance and were unwilling to plant oil crops. In one county in Henan Province, the planting task was 140,000 mu, but the townships arbitrarily reduced the plan to 90,000 mu, and the villages continued to reduce the plan to 80,000 mu. There are many such examples. Although some areas have arranged the planting figures, the local leading organs have not checked and supervised them, so that the work of planting oil crops has fallen into a state of laissez-faire. This is a serious phenomenon at present.
　　Some rural workers only pay attention to the production of grain and cotton, while neglecting the production of oil. They believe that the state has stipulated measures for "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" for increasing grain production; and various preferential measures have been set for developing cotton production; the same measures have not been taken for oil production, which seems to indicate that the oil production task is not very important. This view is very wrong. It should be pointed out that it is absolutely necessary to attach importance to grain and cotton production. This work should be done even better. But completing the oil production task is equally important. Oil is an indispensable raw material for industrial production, edible oil is a necessity for people's daily life, and it is also a very important export commodity. Oil cake is currently China's most important commercial fertilizer and good feed. At present, China's oil production has not recovered to the pre-war level, and it cannot meet the needs of the country and the people. Our task is to rapidly increase oil production. We don't have to be afraid that oil crops will encroach on grain fields. Oil crops such as sunflowers, castor beans, and sesame can be planted in the gaps where grain and cotton are not planted, such as field edges, ridges, roadsides, and ditch edges. Oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts can also be intercropped with crops such as corn and sorghum. According to experiments in many areas, adopting this intercropping method does not reduce the area of grain planting and can increase the production of oil crops. This spring, many areas have expanded the planting area of oil crops using these methods.
　　At present, the supply of edible oil and oil cake in rural areas cannot meet the growing needs of the broad masses of farmers after liberation. Too few oil crops are planted, and the yield per unit area of oil crops is too low. In order to change this situation, the only way is to increase oil production. If production increases by one point, the supply of edible oil and oil cake will improve by one point. Farmers are the producers of oil crops, and they are also the largest consumers of edible oil and oil cake. One of the main purposes of the state's call for farmers to increase oil crop production is to improve the supply of edible oil and oil cake to farmers. Every farmer should respond to the call of the state, obey the state's plan, those who have not planted oil crops in the past should learn to plant oil crops, and first strive for self-sufficiency in edible oil; those who are accustomed to planting oil crops should work harder to increase production and sell the surplus oil to the state. Farmers who plant oil crops should strive for a bumper harvest of both grain and oil crops. This is beneficial to themselves and to the country.
　　In order to expand the planting area of oil crops, we must do a good job in the sowing of oil crops in summer and autumn. Farmers in parts or most areas of Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces have the habit of planting sesame and soybeans in summer. In single-season rice areas in the Yangtze River Basin and its south, after the harvest of early rice, early corn, and early soybeans, another season of late sesame can be planted before the winter crops are sown. Farmers in the subtropical regions of the south also have the habit of planting autumn peanuts and perennial castor beans before October. Rural workers in these areas should lead the broad masses of farmers to make full use of local conditions and plant all the cultivated land that should be planted with oil crops according to the national plan; and they should use all available gaps to try to plant more. Naturally, it is difficult to increase oil crops in these areas. For example, some areas are still threatened by drought, so they should lead farmers to fight drought and sow. Agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should guarantee the supply of seeds needed for planting late sesame or perennial castor beans in subtropical regions. Everyone should work together to actively complete and overfulfill the plan for sowing oil crops in summer and autumn.
　　The yield per unit area of oil crops in China is very low. This is due to extremely backward farming techniques. Therefore, it is of great significance to strengthen field management of oil crops, adopt new technologies, and increase yield per unit area. The experience of many areas has proved that strengthening field management of oil crops can greatly increase yield per unit area. In some areas of Guangxi, the use of topping and soil pressing during the late flowering stage of peanuts can increase the production by 30% to 60% compared with the general method of planting peanuts. Farmers in Shandong, Sichuan and other provinces can also increase peanut production by 20% to 30% by using the method of soil cultivation before flowering. Farmers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plant flax, implement early cultivation, and apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer half a month before flowering, and the yield can be increased by two times. Farmers in Hubei Province plant sesame, adopt the method of early cultivation, continuous cultivation three times, and soil cultivation to prevent waterlogging. The average yield per mu is 78 jin, which is more than 20% higher than the national average yield. Oil crops such as sunflowers and castor beans can increase yields through artificial assisted pollination and increased application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The yield of oil tea, a woody oil crop, can also be increased by 30% to 40% after cultivation.
　　Strengthening field management of oil crops must be prepared with certain material conditions and technical conditions. Fertilizers, pesticides and other materials must be fully supplied; relevant agricultural technologies must be taught to farmers in a timely manner. There are many areas where oil crops have been newly planted this year, and the teaching of oil crop planting techniques should be strengthened in these areas. This year, many areas only focused on expanding the planting area of oil crops during spring sowing, but did not pay attention to teaching planting techniques. This deviation must be corrected.
　　This year, employees and students in many cities have planted oil crops such as sunflowers and castor beans in order to increase oil production. Although these are scattered, the total area is not small. We should strengthen the guidance of these amateur oil production activities to ensure planting, survival, and increased production. Some staff and students of organs and schools only pay attention to planting, but not to management, so that the planted sunflowers, castor beans and other crops do not grow well. Local agricultural departments should provide necessary technical guidance in response to this situation.

### 争取实现今年油料作物的生产计划

　　争取实现今年油料作物的生产计划
    按照国家的计划，今年我国的油料生产要比去年增加三分之一左右。但今年春播任务没有完成，因此，我们必须十分重视夏季播种的工作，并尽力提高单位面积的产量，争取完成国家的计划。
    今年春季油料作物播种计划所以没有完成，在部分地区是受了气候干旱的影响；在多数地区则是由于农村工作人员和农民还没有充分认识它的重要性，不愿意种植油料作物。河南省有一个县的播种任务是十四万亩，各乡擅自缩减计划，改为九万亩，各村继续缩减计划，改为八万亩。这样的例子是很不少的。有些地区虽然把播种数字布置下去了，但当地的领导机关却没有加以检查督促，以致播种油料作物的工作陷于自流，这是当前的一个严重现象。
    有些农村工作人员，只重视生产粮、棉，而轻视生产油料。他们以为国家对于提高粮食生产，规定了“定产、定购、定销”的措施；对于发展棉花生产，定出了种种优待的办法；对于油料生产没有采取同样的措施，这似乎就是表示油料生产任务很不重要。这种看法是很错误的。应该指出：重视粮棉生产是完全必需的。这方面的工作应该作得更好。但完成油料生产任务却是同样的重要。油料是工业生产上不可缺少的原料，食油是人民日常生活的必需品，又是极重要的出口物资，油饼则是我国当前最重要的商品肥料和良好的饲料。现在我国的油料产量还没有恢复到战前的水平，还不能满足国家和人民的需要，我们的任务是要迅速增加油料的生产。我们不必害怕油料作物会侵占了粮田。油料作物中的向日葵、蓖麻、芝麻等都可以在田边、地埂、路旁、沟沿等不种粮、棉的空隙地方种植。油料作物中的黄豆、花生等也可以和玉米、高粱等作物间作。根据许多地区试验，采用这种间作方法，既不缩减粮食种植面积，又能增产油料作物。今年春季，有许多地区就是用这些方法扩大了油料作物种植面积的。
    现在农村中食油和油饼的供应量还不能满足广大农民在解放后日益增长的需要，种植的油料作物还太少，油料作物的单位面积产量也还太低。为了改变这种状况，唯一的方法就是增加油料的生产。生产增加一分，食油和油饼的供应状况就会改善一分。农民是油料作物的生产者，又是食油和油饼的最大量的消费者。国家号召农民增加油料作物生产，最主要的目的之一，就是为了改善对农民的食油和油饼的供应状况。每一个农民都应该响应国家的号召，服从国家的计划，过去不种植油料作物的要学会种植油料作物，首先争取食油自给；习惯于种植油料的更应该努力增产，把多余的油料卖给国家。种植油料作物的农民完全应该争取粮食、油料同时丰收。这对自己和对国家都是有利的。
    为了扩大油料作物的种植面积，我们必须把夏秋两季油料作物播种工作做好。安徽、江苏、山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西等省部分或大部地区的农民，都有夏种芝麻、黄豆的习惯。长江流域及其以南的单季稻地区，在早稻、早玉米、早黄豆收获以后到冬季作物播种以前，还可以加种一季晚芝麻。南方亚热带地区的农民，也有种秋花生和在十月以前种植多年生蓖麻的习惯。这些地区的农村工作人员，应该领导广大农民，充分运用当地的条件，按照国家计划，把应该种植油料作物的耕地全部种上；并应利用一切隙地，尽量争取多种一些。自然，这些地区增种油料作物是有困难的。例如，有的地区目前仍受干旱的威胁，这就应该领导农民抗旱播种。亚热带地区为了加种晚芝麻或多年生蓖麻所需要的种子，农业部门和供销社应该保证供应。大家共同努力，积极完成并超额完成夏秋季播种油料作物的计划。
    我国油料作物的单位面积产量是很低的。这是由于耕作技术十分落后。因此，加强油料作物的田间管理，采用新的技术，提高单位面积产量是有重大意义的。许多地区的经验证明，加强油料作物的田间管理，可以大大提高单位面积产量。广西一些地区在花生盛花末期用剪顶和撒土压蔓的方法加以培植，比用一般方法种植的花生增产百分之三十到六十。山东、四川等省的农民采用在开花前培土的办法，也能使花生增产百分之二、三十。内蒙古自治区的农民种植胡麻，实行及早中耕、花前半个月追施磷钾肥的方法，产量可提高两倍。湖北省农民种植芝麻，采用及早中耕、连续中耕三次和培土防涝的办法，每亩平均产量七十八斤，比全国平均产量高百分之二十以上。向日葵、蓖麻等油料作物，经过人工辅助授粉和增施磷钾肥，都可以提高产量。木本油料中的油茶经过抚育也可以提高产量百分之三、四十。
    加强油料作物的田间管理，必须准备一定的物质条件和技术条件。肥料、农药等物资必须充分供应；有关的农业技术必须及时传授给农民。今年新种油料的地区很多，在这些地区尤其应该加强种植油料技术的传授工作。今年春播中有许多地区只顾扩大油料作物种植面积，而不管传授种植技术，这种偏向必须纠正。
    今年许多城市的职工、学生为了增产油料，纷纷种植向日葵、蓖麻等油料作物，这些虽然是分散的，但总面积是不小的。我们应该加强对这些业余增产油料活动的指导，做到保种、保活、保证增产。有些机关、学校的工作人员和学生只重种植，不重管理，以致种植的向日葵、蓖麻等作物生长不好。当地农业部门应该针对这种情况，给以必要的技术指导。
