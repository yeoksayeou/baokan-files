Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 10th: U.S. President Eisenhower signed on July 8th the U.S. Foreign "Aid" Act for the 1956 fiscal year, which helps the United States to realize its aggressive plans around the world, especially in Asia.

This bill, finally passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress on the 7th, stipulates that the United States will allocate more than 3.285 billion U.S. dollars as a fund for "aid" to other countries in the 1956 fiscal year. Asia is the focus of "aid," with allocations to Asia accounting for two-thirds of the total allocation. Among the allocations to Asia, more than 80 percent is military "aid" for the purpose of preparing for war.

The testimonies of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson to the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on the foreign "aid" program, released on the 7th, exposed the true purpose of this American "aid."

Dulles said in his testimony that the reason the United States "aids" some countries "is basically not because we want to help them. Unless we estimate that aid will promote the supreme interests of the United States in some way, we will not give any aid." Dulles also said: "Every dollar 'aid'ed" to foreign countries is spent directly or indirectly in the United States.

Robertson, in emphasizing that the United States should focus on "aiding" Asia, said that Asian countries "possess a huge population and resources and are in a strategic position." Robertson made it clear that the purpose of the U.S. "aid" is to establish and maintain armies like the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Syngman Rhee clique armies that are trained and equipped by the United States.

    美国国会通过“援外”法案
    说明美国要加强在亚洲的侵略计划
    新华社十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在七月八日签署了一个帮助美国在全世界，特别在亚洲实现其侵略计划的一九五六财政年度美国对外“援助”法案。
    这个被美国国会两院在七日最后通过的法案规定，美国在一九五六财政年度将拨出三十二亿八千五百余万美元作为对其他国家进行“援助”的基金。亚洲是被“援助”的重点，给予亚洲的拨款占全部拨款的三分之二。而在给亚洲的拨款中，有百分之八十以上是以准备战争为目的的军事“援助”。
    七日公布的美国国务卿杜勒斯和助理国务卿罗伯逊在众议院拨款委员会小组委员会上就对外“援助”计划发表的证词，暴露了美国这种“援助”的真正目的。
    杜勒斯在证词中说，美国所以“援助”一些国家，“基本上不是因为我们想帮它们的忙。除非我们估计援助将在某方面促进美国的最高利益，我们是不给任何援助的”。杜勒斯还说：“援助”外国的每一块美元都是直接或间接地花在美国的。
    罗伯逊在强调美国要着重“援助”亚洲时说，亚洲国家“拥有庞大的人口和资源，并且处于战略地位”。罗伯逊表明，美国的“援助”是要建立和维持由美国训练和装备的蒋介石集团和李承晚集团军队那样的军队。
