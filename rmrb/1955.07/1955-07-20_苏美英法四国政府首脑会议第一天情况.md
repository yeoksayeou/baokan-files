At 10:00 AM, the heads and members of the delegations of the four countries took their seats. Also in the hall were the delegations' advisors and experts.

United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, on behalf of the United Nations, extended congratulations to the participants of the conference. He pointed out that the purpose of the summit conference of the four governments is closely linked to the interests of the United Nations organization and all United Nations member states. Hammarskjöld wished the participants of the conference success in fulfilling the important tasks of the conference.

At the invitation of the delegations of all participating countries, the first meeting was presided over by US President Eisenhower. It was agreed that the heads of delegations of each country will take turns chairing the meeting in the future.

In opening the first meeting as chairman, Eisenhower expressed his hope that he would have the opportunity to not only resume official contact with the participants of the meeting, but also to resume friendly contact. He expressed his belief that the participants of the meeting would entrust him to express their gratitude to the Swiss government for its assistance with the conference.

Eisenhower continued, "We have reached the following agreement: the procedure of the meeting will be agreed upon by the foreign ministers of the four countries, in particular, to establish a joint secretariat of the four countries. Wilkinson (Great Britain) will serve as the Secretary-General of the Secretariat. Representatives of the other three delegations will serve as Deputy Secretaries-General. The Joint Secretariat will draft unanimously agreed reports on various formal decisions that may be adopted by this meeting."

Eisenhower then pointed out that the program for the first day of the meeting stipulated: the heads of government will hold two meetings, the next meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 18th. In the future, foreign ministers' meetings will be held every morning, and heads of government meetings will be held every afternoon. Eisenhower added that it is quite obvious that if the heads of government wish to change this procedure, then they can do so at any time.

Faure, Eden, and Bulganin expressed their agreement to this working procedure.

Next, Eisenhower, in his capacity as the head of the US delegation, spoke first at the meeting. French Prime Minister Faure then spoke.

The morning meeting then adjourned.

At the afternoon meeting, British Prime Minister Eden and the head of the Soviet delegation, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin, spoke.

Chairman Eisenhower, at the close of the July 18th meeting, said that he would like to make a few comments. He said: "I am very pleased to see that every delegation has expressed its determination to work together for the cause of peace in a spirit of friendly cooperation. We will spend several days and many hours discussing various issues and details, and each delegation will uphold the correctness and wisdom of its own views."

Eisenhower said, "We should not expect that, in order to find common ground for agreement, each delegation will easily give up its position. But if we can maintain a friendly spirit in all these debates, then we can prove to ourselves and to the world that what we say about our desire to cooperate for the cause of peace is sincere, and our meeting will achieve great success. I believe that, through such efforts and working in this spirit, we will achieve great achievements in actually solving problems, which is why we have gathered here for this purpose."

The meeting then adjourned.

According to the adopted procedure, the foreign ministers of the four countries will hold a meeting at 11:00 AM on the 19th. The summit conference of the four governments will be held at 4:00 PM on the 19th.
