Introducing Shanti Bardhan's Little Ballet Troupe of India
　　Ye Zhou　Zhang Bihua
During each performance by the Indian Cultural Delegation, we always see a smiling, middle-aged man's portrait placed beside the stage. This is Shanti Bardhan, who dedicated himself to the people's art, a great Indian music writer and dancer, and the founder of the Little Ballet Troupe.

The Little Ballet Troupe was founded in 1952. In that year, when a flood occurred in Bombay Province, five young artists wanted to organize a dance troupe to perform publicly to raise funds to help the victims. They found the famous and enthusiastic master of Manipuri and Tipura dance, Shanti Bardhan, to be their instructor. The Little Ballet Troupe was thus established. In June of the following year, the troupe's first performance was a puppet dance drama "The Story of Ramayana," written and directed by Shanti Bardhan. The initial performance caused a sensation in the Indian dance scene and received favorable reviews and attention from the audience. They toured throughout India, performing 125 shows for workers, women, students, and other social strata. When they performed in New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Nehru personally attended the show. He greatly appreciated the Little Ballet Troupe's performance and introduced them to perform for the Indian troops in various military regions of India.

Puppet shows have a long history in India and are very popular among the people, but it was the first time in India that dancers imitated the movements of puppets, combining ballet and puppet shows for performance. Shanti Bardhan's creation was very successful. From this puppet dance drama, we can not only see the dance postures of different Indian classical dance schools, but also many beautiful Indian folk dances. This is the culmination of his long-term, painstaking study of Indian classical dance and the traditional folk dances he collected throughout India.

The music accompanying the Little Ballet Troupe's performances also includes classical and folk music. The troupe's band has only six members, but they use fifty different instruments. The story of "Ramayana" gradually developed from North India to South India, so the instruments used and the music accompanied also changed from northern music to southern music as the plot developed.

The masks used by the actors are also unique. General stage masks are round, but they use square ones. The head of the Little Ballet Troupe, the late Mrs. Shanti Bardhan, the wife of the Little Ballet Troupe's founder, specifically introduced these square masks to reporters. She said that once they accidentally saw a square Buddha statue in a temple, which inspired them. The use of square masks can produce a better effect in puppet dances. Mrs. Bardhan also introduced their costumes made of burlap bags, which are economical, beautiful, and non-reflective. If she hadn't said it, the audience would never have believed that these colorful and dazzling costumes were made of coarse burlap.

The stage setting used by the Little Ballet Troupe also has a unique style. The props used are very simple, a tree, a small hut, but the audience can understand them at a glance. The scene changes are done subtly and are mostly brought on stage by the actors themselves.

Another feature of the Little Ballet Troupe is that it requires actors to perform different roles. The troupe has only twenty-two people in total, so generally an actor has to play five or six roles in a play, and some even have to play eleven roles. Sometimes even the people in the band have to go on stage. Because they are small in number, they call themselves the "Little Ballet Troupe."

The story of "Ramayana" performed by the troupe is one of the most popular and longest-standing epics in India. It tells how the kind and brave Prince Rama, with the help of the righteous and courageous monkey king Hanuman, defeated the demon king Ravana and rescued his newlywed wife Sita. In India, the story of "Ramayana" is well known to every household. In the hearts of the Indian people, Prince Rama is a typical figure symbolizing kindness, bravery, and all virtues, while the demon king Ravana symbolizes all evil things. The story of "Ramayana" is expressed in India through storytelling, dance, puppet shows, and other art forms. The Little Ballet Troupe uses the form of a puppet dance drama to perform it, which is a comprehensive creation that integrates Indian dance, music, and other arts.

After the puppet dance drama was first performed in New Delhi, the dance critic of The Times of India published a commentary the next day, believing that the puppet dance performed by the Little Ballet Troupe was the most attractive expression of the "Ramayana" story.

Whether in New Delhi, Bombay, or other Indian cities, the Little Ballet Troupe's performances have always been the subject of enthusiastic discussion in local newspapers. One Bombay newspaper wrote: "The actors perform so realistically that the audience feels as if there is really an invisible giant behind the scenes manipulating these large puppets." Another New Delhi newspaper believed that the Little Ballet Troupe's performance of puppet dance was a major event in the Indian dance scene and would have a positive impact on the future of Indian dance drama.

After watching the performance of this puppet dance drama, Prime Minister Nehru wrote an article. He said: "I had heard many people praise this puppet show before, and after watching it, I felt that this praise was indeed justified. The Little Ballet Troupe's material conditions are not good, but they can perform such a good play, which is really unusual. I want to congratulate the performers of this puppet dance drama, and I think they should be encouraged and supported."

Another dance drama performed by the Little Ballet Troupe is "Gaining Friends," which is based on the second volume of the "Panchatantra," a book familiar to the Indian people. It describes how three friends—a crow, a mouse, and a turtle—help each other and rescue a fawn from a hunter's trap. Its theme is friendship, unity, and peace.

The first performance of "Gaining Friends" immediately caused a sensation in the Indian dance scene. Many critics not only praised its script, theme, music, and dance, but also affirmed that the Little Ballet Troupe was a vigorous new force in the Indian dance scene. This spring, the Little Ballet Troupe specially performed this dance drama for the peace delegates from various Asian countries attending the Asian Countries Conference in New Delhi, which won much praise.

In order to rehearse "Gaining Friends," in order to experience life and observe the lives of animals, the Little Ballet Troupe specially moved to a village not far from Bombay to live. They set up a house in the valley, studied the movements of various birds and animals, and created new dance steps. The musicians also visited the residents of the forest, learning their dances and music. The actors of the troupe personally dyed, painted, sewed costumes, and made various sets and props. They used the natural forests to build a theater that could accommodate 500 audience members, and here, they performed for the nearby residents and solicited their opinions. The Little Ballet Troupe specifically drew a picture of this natural theater as a gift to the Chinese art community during their visit to our country.

The screenwriter and director of the dance drama "Gaining Friends" was also Shanti Bardhan. It is very regrettable that Shanti Bardhan passed away before this dance drama was publicly performed, which is a great loss to the Indian dance scene. Newspapers all over India prominently published the unfortunate news of the death of this great artist who devoted himself to Indian art and published articles to mourn and commemorate him.

Shanti Bardhan is the author of the famous Indian dance dramas "Immortal India" and "The Discovery of India," which are full of patriotism. As early as 1940, he had already enjoyed fame and was listed as a master of the Manipuri dance school, one of the four major classical dance schools in India. But he was not satisfied with his achievements, and he continued to study diligently. He wanted to further study the relationship between Indian classical dance and the dances currently popular among the people. Hard and intense work caused him to contract tuberculosis. But he still traveled from one region to another to find and study folk dances. He directed the Little Ballet Troupe's performance of "The Story of Ramayana" while struggling with his illness. While rehearsing "Gaining Friends," he already had to lie in bed and use hand gestures to direct. Shanti Bardhan passed away on September 3, 1954. In order to commemorate their founder and mentor, the Little Ballet Troupe always places his portrait next to the stage during each performance and hangs the flowers offered by the audience on his portrait.

In addition to performing the two dance dramas "The Story of Ramayana" and "Gaining Friends," the Little Ballet Troupe also performed two folk dances in Beijing—a local dance from Gujarat called "Rumaal" (Handkerchief Dance) and a mountain gypsy dance from Hyderabad in South India. These two programs were warmly welcomed by the audience.

The performance of the Little Ballet Troupe in Beijing gave us the opportunity to see classical dances with a long cultural history and artistic perfection, and beautiful folk dances full of the enthusiasm and wisdom of the Indian people. On the one hand, we want to thank the Little Ballet Troupe actors for their enthusiastic performances, and on the other hand, we want to commemorate the founder of the Little Ballet Troupe, Shanti Bardhan, and learn from his spirit of working for the people's art and his diligent style.

    介绍山蒂·巴丹创办的印度小巴蕾舞剧团
　　叶周　张璧华
    印度文化代表团每次演出的时候，我们总看到在舞台旁边放着一张笑容可掬的中年人的半身照片。他就是献身于人民艺术、伟大的印度舞曲作家和舞蹈家、小巴蕾舞剧团的创办人山蒂·巴丹。
    小巴蕾舞剧团创办于一九五二年。当年孟买省发生水灾，有五位年轻的艺术家想组织一个舞蹈团公开演出筹款救济灾民。他们找到了著名的热情的曼尼普利舞和梯拍拉舞派大师山蒂·巴丹做他们的指导。小巴蕾舞剧团就这样成立了。第二年六月剧团第一次演出由山蒂·巴丹编剧和导演的傀儡舞剧“罗摩衍”的故事。初次演出就轰动了印度舞坛，得到了观众的好评和重视。他们在印度各地巡回演出，前后为工人、妇女、学生及其他阶层演出了一百二十五场。在新德里演出时，印度总理尼赫鲁也亲自莅场观看。他很赞赏小巴蕾舞剧的表演并且介绍他们到印度各军区为印度的部队演出。
    傀儡戏在印度已有很久的历史，在民间很流行，但是由舞蹈演员来模仿傀儡的动作，以巴蕾舞和傀儡戏相结合的形式来演出，在印度还是第一次。山蒂·巴丹的这一创造是很成功的。从这个傀儡舞剧中我们不仅可以看到不同的印度古典舞派的舞姿，而且也可以看到许多印度民间的优美的舞蹈。这是他长期刻苦钻研印度古典舞和在印度各地所收集的传统的民间舞的结晶品。
    小巴蕾舞剧团在演出时伴奏的音乐也包括古典和民间的音乐。剧团的乐队只有六人，可是他们却使用着五十种不同的乐器。“罗摩衍”的故事从北印开始逐渐发展到南印，因此他们所用的乐器和所伴奏的音乐也随着剧情的发展从北部音乐转为南部音乐。
    演员们所用的面具，也是独创一格。一般的舞台面具是圆的，而他们用的却是方的。小巴蕾舞剧团团长、已故的小巴蕾舞剧团的团长山蒂·巴丹的夫人特别对记者介绍了这种方面具，她说，有一次他们偶然在一个庙宇里看到了方面形的菩萨塑像，由此得到了启发。采用方形的面具可使傀儡舞产生更好的效果。巴丹夫人还介绍了他们自己用麻袋布制成的服装，经济又美观、又不反光。如果她不说穿的话，在台下的观众怎么也不会相信这些色彩鲜艳夺目的服装是用粗麻布做的。
    小巴蕾舞剧团所用的舞台布景也别有风格。用的道具很简单，一棵树，一所小茅屋，但是观众能够一目了然。布景是采用暗转换景，而且大都是由演员自己带上台来的。
    小巴蕾舞剧团的另外一个特点是要求演员们能演出不同的角色。剧团一共才二十二人，因此一般演员在一出戏中要演五、六个角色，有的甚至要演十一个角色。有时连乐队的人也要上场。因为他们人数少，所以自称为“小巴蕾舞剧团”。
    剧团所演出的“罗摩衍”的故事是印度流行最广的、最悠久的史诗之一。它叙述善良的、勇敢的罗摩王子如何在见义勇为的猴王哈努曼的帮助下打败了魔王拉万，救出了他的新婚的妻子悉达。在印度，“罗摩衍”的故事是家喻户晓的。在印度人民的心目中，罗摩王子是象征着善良、勇敢和一切美德的典型的人物，而魔王拉万象征着一切邪恶的东西。罗摩衍的故事在印度通过说唱、舞蹈、傀儡戏和其他艺术形式表现出来。小巴蕾舞剧团用傀儡舞剧的形式来演出，是一种集印度的舞蹈、音乐和其他艺术的大成的综合形式的创造。
    傀儡舞剧第一次在新德里演出后，印度时报的舞蹈评论家在第二天就发表评论，认为小巴蕾舞剧团所演出的傀儡舞是最吸引人的“罗摩衍”故事的一种表现形式。
    不论是在新德里、孟买或其他印度各城市，小巴蕾舞剧团的演出总是成为当地报纸热烈讨论的对象。有一家孟买的报纸写道：“演员们演得如此逼真，观众感到好像真的有一个无形的巨人在幕后牵动着这些大傀儡似的。”另一家新德里的报纸认为小巴蕾舞剧团演出傀儡舞是印度舞坛的一件大事，对印度舞剧的未来将有积极的影响。
    尼赫鲁总理看了这个傀儡舞剧的演出后写了一篇文章。他说：“我以前曾听到过很多人赞赏这个傀儡剧，我看了以后，觉得这种赞赏的确有道理，小巴蕾舞剧团的物质条件并不好，但竟能演出这么好的戏，真不寻常。我要向这次傀儡舞剧的演出者们庆贺，我认为他们是应当得到鼓励和支持的。”
    小巴蕾舞剧团演出的另一个舞剧是“争取朋友”，这是根据印度人民所熟悉的“五卷书”的第二卷创作的。它描写三个朋友——乌鸦、老鼠和乌龟，如何互相帮助并且从猎人的陷阱里救出一只小鹿的故事，它的主题是友好、团结、和平。
    “争取朋友”第一次演出，立即又轰动了印度的舞坛。许多评论家们不仅赞美它的编剧、主题、音乐和舞蹈，而且肯定地认为小巴蕾舞剧团是印度舞坛上一支朝气勃勃的新生力量。今年春天小巴蕾舞剧团特别为参加在新德里召开的亚洲国家会议的各国和平代表们演出了这个舞剧，博得了许多好评。
    为了排演“争取朋友”，为了体验生活，观察动物的生活，小巴蕾舞剧团特别搬到离孟买不远的一个乡村去住。他们在山谷里置了一所房子，研究多种鸟兽的动作，创造新的舞步。音乐家们更访问了林间的居民，学习他们的舞蹈和音乐。剧团的演员们亲自动手染，画，缝制服装和制造各种布景和道具。他们利用天然的树林，搭成了一座能容五百观众的剧场，就在这里，他们为邻近的居民演出并征求他们的意见。小巴蕾舞剧团这次到我国来，特别画了一幅这个天然剧场的图画作为礼物赠给中国艺术界。
    “争取朋友”这个舞剧的编导也是山蒂·巴丹。非常令人遗憾的是，这个舞剧还没有公开演出，山蒂·巴丹就不幸逝世了，这是印度舞坛的巨大损失。印度各地报纸都以显著地位刊载这位献身于印度艺术的伟大艺术家逝世的不幸消息，并发表文章追悼纪念他。
    山蒂·巴丹是著名的充满着爱国主义精神的印度舞剧“不朽的印度”和“印度的发现”的作者。早在一九四○年，他已享有盛名，被列为印度四大古典舞派别之一的曼尼普利舞派的大师。可是他并不满足于他的成绩，他仍然不断地刻苦钻研，他想进一步研究印度古典舞蹈和当前流行于民间的舞蹈的关系。辛苦的、紧张的工作使他染上了肺结核病。但是他仍然从一个地区到另外一个地区寻找和研究民间的舞蹈。他扶病导演小巴蕾舞剧团演出的“罗摩衍”的故事。在排演“争取朋友”的时候，他已经不得不躺在床上以手姿来指导。山蒂·巴丹在一九五四年九月三日逝世。为了纪念他们的创办人和导师，小巴蕾舞剧团在每次演出时一定把他的遗照放在舞台旁边并且拿观众所献的鲜花挂在他的照片上。
    小巴蕾舞剧团在北京除了演出“罗摩衍”的故事和“争取朋友”这两个舞剧外还演出了二个民间舞——古吉拉特地方的一个叫作“鲁玛尔”（手帕舞）和南印海德拉巴山地吉普赛民族舞。这二个都是受到观众热烈欢迎的节目。
    小巴蕾舞剧团在北京的演出使我们有机会看到具有悠久的文化历史的艺术上完美的古典舞蹈和充满着印度人民的热情和智慧的优美的民间舞蹈。我们一方面要感谢小巴蕾舞剧团演员们的热情演出，一方面要纪念小巴蕾舞剧团的创办人山蒂·巴丹，同时要学习他的为着人民艺术而工作的精神和刻苦的作风。
