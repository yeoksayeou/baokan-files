Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 21st: Special Correspondent Reports: The Four-Power Summit continued its meeting on the afternoon of July 20th. All members of the Soviet, American, British, and French delegations attended the meeting. Advisers and experts from each delegation also participated.

    British Prime Minister Eden served as chairman.

    He proposed that, based on the recommendations of the four foreign ministers, the discussion of the second item on the agenda—the issue of European security—begin.

    The first to speak on this issue was the head of the Soviet delegation, Bulganin. He pointed out that the Soviet government believes that the issue of establishing a European collective security system is of great significance. The Soviet government believes that the security of the people of all European countries can only be guaranteed by the joint efforts of all European countries, large and small. At the same time, upholding peace in Europe is of decisive significance for guaranteeing world peace.

    Bulganin mentioned that the Soviet Union advocates that European countries and the United States all participate in the European collective security system.

    Bulganin continued, "We believe that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should participate in this collective security system, and after the unification of Germany, a unified Germany should participate in the system. In order to promote the possibility of reaching an agreement on this important issue, the Soviet government has proposed at the meeting to divide the work of establishing a European collective security system into two stages."

    Bulganin continued, "In the first stage, these countries do not have to解除 [jiechu - remove, relieve] their obligations under existing treaties and agreements, but they should guarantee to renounce the use of force and resolve any disputes that may arise between them through peaceful means. In the second stage, these countries should undertake all the obligations related to the establishment of a European collective security system in accordance with the corresponding treaty, and at the same time declare the North Atlantic Treaty, the Paris Agreements, and the Warsaw Pact completely invalid. These treaties and agreements will be abolished and replaced by an all-European collective security system."

    Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet proposal would promote the possibility of reaching a necessary agreement, because, on the one hand, the implementation of this proposal will guarantee the establishment of genuine security for the people of all European countries, and on the other hand, it also takes into account the fact that many European countries have assumed obligations in existing treaties and agreements.

    Bulganin said that the Soviet delegation is submitting its proposal on the issue of establishing an all-European collective security system for discussion at the meeting. He said that this proposal contains the basic principles of the corresponding treaty. Reaching an agreement on these principles will facilitate reaching agreements on other issues that may arise in the process of discussing such an important issue as the establishment of an effective all-European security system.

    Bulganin said that the full text of the draft of the basic principles of the aforementioned all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security will be distributed to the heads of government of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.

    Subsequently, Eisenhower spoke. He said that the main difference between the Soviet and American delegations on the issue under discussion is the issue of the urgency of restoring German unification. He believes that it is not right to start drafting a security treaty without trying to use all means to restore German unification. He said that he thought the Soviet representatives had studied this issue more carefully than the American representatives, but he still believed that it was unreasonable not to establish an organization to study the issue of a unified Germany.

    Eisenhower concluded by saying that this is all he wanted to say at the moment, because no one welcomes the remarks made by the Soviet delegation in its speech that peace must be sought for everyone, not just for a part of the countries, more than the American delegation. French delegation head Faure said that, like President Eisenhower, he believed that the issue of security was linked to the issue of a unified Germany. He said that as long as Germany is not unified, we are preserving an abnormal situation, a source of tension, in the heart of Europe, right in its center, among people with certain characteristics.

    Faure then expressed his views on the Soviet delegation's proposal on the issue of establishing a European collective security system. Faure said that, naturally, he understood the spirit in which Marshal Bulganin made the proposal, he welcomed this spirit, and he thanked the Soviet delegation for once again affirmatively demonstrating its sincere desire to strive for the establishment of an effective security system. However, Faure believes that the Soviet proposal creates certain difficulties for the resolution of this issue.

    Eden then spoke. He said that the British delegation is prepared to agree to any proposals on guaranteeing security that can strengthen trust between European countries. According to Eden's opinion, the proposal put forward by Britain to conclude a convention between the four countries participating in the Geneva Conference and a unified Germany would contribute to this goal. Eden said that this convention, like the Soviet proposal, stipulates that if one country is attacked by another country, all other countries should provide assistance. Eden believed that the participation of the above five countries in the convention could guarantee that current problems would be resolved and could serve as a guarantee for the security of small countries. Eden added that the British delegation is prepared to consider the issue of increasing the number of contracting parties, but his premise is that this convention should not include all European countries.

    Eden added that he agreed with President Eisenhower and Faure's opinion that a security system should not be attempted to be established while Germany remains divided. Eden said that, because divergent opinions on this issue have been expressed here, it may be beneficial to study the issue of drafting a security convention and restoring German unification at the same time, but on one condition, that this convention will not be all-encompassing, because doing so may excessively delay Germany's accession to the convention.

    Bulganin then spoke again, offering some comments on the views expressed by the representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.

    Bulganin said that his main point was that the Soviet delegation did not want to discuss the German issue that had already been discussed yesterday.

    Bulganin said, "In our opinion, everyone fully expressed all their views on this issue yesterday, and our views have been stated clearly enough. According to our unanimous agreement, today we are discussing the second issue, namely the issue of the European security system."

    Bulganin mentioned that some people said in their speeches that the German issue is related to the issue of establishing a European collective security system. Bulganin said that this is indisputable and that the preamble to the Soviet draft all-European treaty mentions this. However, this is by no means to say that the German issue and the issue of establishing a collective security system are one and the same. These are two separate issues.

    Bulganin said that, of course, the Soviet delegation does not believe that its proposal on the issue of establishing a European collective security system is perfect.

    He said, "We are prepared to study any proposals, as long as such proposals can make our proposals more perfect in this or that aspect. For example, we pay close attention to the valuable suggestions put forward by Eden. The Soviet delegation does not believe that the collective security system should include all European countries at once. In this regard, perhaps a gradual approach should be taken. From this point of view, Eden's opinions are very meaningful and worthy of attention."

    Bulganin said that the Soviet delegation is also prepared to consider and study other opinions together with their colleagues in order to make the Soviet proposals more perfect.

    Eisenhower said that the draft all-European treaty on the establishment of a European collective security system proposed by the Soviet delegation should be carefully studied.

    He said, "I myself have spoken with almost all the members of the Soviet delegation. Their views are different from ours, but I believe that they, like us, sincerely hope for peace. The question is how to reconcile the different views expressed at the meeting."

    At the end, the four heads of government reached a unanimous decision: the foreign ministers will meet on the 21st to determine whether they can draft a detailed proposal to serve as a guideline for discussing the issue of European security and the German issue.

    The meeting then adjourned.

### 四国政府首脑会议开始讨论欧洲安全问题  苏联代表团提出全欧条约草案

    四国政府首脑会议开始讨论欧洲安全问题
    苏联代表团提出全欧条约草案
    新华社二十一日讯　塔斯社日内瓦二十一日讯：特派记者报道：四国政府首脑会议七月二十日下午继续举行会议。苏、美、英、法四国代表团的全体团员都出席了这次会议。各国代表团的顾问和专家也参加了会议。
    英国首相艾登担任主席。
    他提议，根据四国外长的建议，开始讨论议程的第二项——欧洲安全问题。
    第一个就这个问题发言的是苏联代表团团长布尔加宁。他指出，苏联政府认为，建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题具有重大的意义。苏联政府相信，只有欧洲所有大小国家的共同努力，才能保障欧洲各国人民的安全。同时，拥护欧洲的和平对于保障世界和平具有决定性的意义。
    布尔加宁提到，苏联主张欧洲国家和美国都参加欧洲集体安全体系。
    布尔加宁继续说，我们认为，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国应该参加这个集体安全体系，而在德国统一以后，应该由统一的德国参加这个体系。苏联政府为了促进就这一重要问题缔结协议的可能，已经在会议上提出了把建立欧洲集体安全体系的工作分成两个阶段来进行的建议。
    布尔加宁继续说，在第一阶段，这些国家不必解除它们根据现有的条约和协定所承担的义务，但是它们应保证放弃使用武力，并且通过和平的办法来解决它们之间可能发生的一切争执。在第二阶段内，这些国家应当根据相应的条约承担起同建立欧洲集体安全体系有关的全部义务，并且同时宣告北大西洋公约和巴黎协定以及华沙条约完全失效。这些条约和协定将被废除，而代之以全欧集体安全体系。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联的建议将促进达成必要协议的可能，因为，一方面这个建议的实现将保证为欧洲各国人民建立真正的安全，而另一方面，它也考虑到现在有许多欧洲国家在现有的条约和协定中承担了义务这一事实。
    布尔加宁说，苏联代表团把关于建立全欧集体安全体系问题的建议提交会议讨论。他说，这个建议中包含着相应的条约的基本原则。就这些原则达成协议，便利于就其他问题，即在讨论建立有效的全欧安全体系这样一个重大问题的过程中可能产生的其他问题，取得协议。
    布尔加宁说，上述保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基本原则草案全文将分发给美、法、英三国政府首脑。
    随后，艾森豪威尔发言。他说，苏联代表团和美国代表团在讨论中的问题上的主要分歧是关于恢复德国统一的迫切性的问题。他认为，从拟订安全条约开始，而不设法利用一切方法来恢复德国统一，这种做法是不应该的。他说，他想苏联代表在这个问题上比美国代表研究得更仔细，但是他仍然认为，不建立一个从事研究统一德国问题的机构是不合理的。
    艾森豪威尔最后说，这就是目前他想说的一切，因为没有谁能比美国代表团更欢迎苏联代表团发言中所说的必须为大家、而不仅是为一部分国家谋求和平这种言论。法国代表团团长富尔说，他和艾森豪威尔总统一样，认为安全问题是同统一德国问题联系着的。他说，只要德国没有统一，我们就是在欧洲的心脏、在它的正中央、在有某些特征的人民中保存着紧张根源的不正常情况。
    富尔接着对苏联代表团关于建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议表示了自己的意见。富尔说，自然，他了解布尔加宁元帅是以什么精神提出建议的，他对这种精神表示欢迎，并且对苏联代表团再一次肯定地表现出力求建立有效的安全体系的真挚愿望表示感谢。但是，富尔认为，苏联的建议给这个问题的解决造成了某些困难。
    艾登接着发言。他说，英国代表团准备同意一切能加强欧洲各国间信任的关于保障安全问题的建议。按照艾登的意见，英国所提出的关于参加日内瓦会议的四国和统一的德国缔结一项公约的建议，将会有助于这种目标。艾登说，这个公约，和苏联建议一样，规定如果一个国家遭到另一个国家侵略时，其他各国都应给予援助。艾登认为，上述五个国家参加公约就能保证当前问题获得解决，并可以作为对小国安全的保障。艾登又说，但是，英国代表团准备考虑关于增加缔约国的数目的问题，然而他的前提是，这个公约不应当包括欧洲所有国家。
    艾登又说，他同意艾森豪威尔总统和富尔的这种意见：在德国仍旧陷于分裂状态的时候，不应该企图建立安全体系。艾登说道，但是，由于这里对这一问题表现了分歧的意见，同时研究关于拟订安全公约和恢复德国统一的问题可能是有益的，不过这里有一个条件，就是这一公约将不是无所不包的，因为这样做可能过分拖延德国加入公约的时间。
    布尔加宁接着再次发言，他对美国、法国和英国的代表所表示的看法提出了一些意见。
    布尔加宁说，他的主要意见是，苏联代表团不希望就昨天已经讨论过的德国问题进行讨论。
    布尔加宁说，在我们看来，在这一问题上，昨天大家把所有的意见全都说了，并且我们的看法已经够明确地加以申述了。根据我们一致的意见，今天我们讨论第二个问题，即关于欧洲安全体系的问题。
    布尔加宁谈到，有人在发言中说：德国问题同建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题相互有关联。布尔加宁说，这一点是无须置辩的，在苏联提出的全欧条约草案的序言中就提到这一点。但是，这绝不是说，德国问题和建立集体安全体系问题就是一个问题。这是两个问题。
    布尔加宁说，当然，苏联代表团并不认为，它提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议就是十分完善的。
    他说，我们准备研究任何建议，只要这种建议在这方面或那方面能使我们的建议更加完善，例如，我们很注意艾登提出的有价值的建议。苏联代表团并不以为集体安全体系应该一下子就把欧洲所有国家都包括在内。在这方面也许要循序渐进，从这一观点来看，艾登提出的意见是很有意义的，值得注意的。
    布尔加宁说，苏联代表团也准备和他们的同僚
    一道来对其他的意见加以考虑和研究，以使苏联的建议更加完善。
    艾森豪威尔说，苏联代表团提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系的全欧条约草案应当加以仔细的研究。
    他说，“我亲自差不多同苏联代表团的所有人员交谈过，他们的观点和我们不一样，但是我相信，他们正如我们一样也是真诚地希望和平的。问题是，怎样使会议上表现出来的不同的观点协调起来。”
    四国政府首脑在结束时作出一致的决定：由外交部长们在二十一日开会确定他们能不能草拟出一个详细的建议，以作为讨论欧洲安全问题和德国问题的准绳。
    会议至此结束。
