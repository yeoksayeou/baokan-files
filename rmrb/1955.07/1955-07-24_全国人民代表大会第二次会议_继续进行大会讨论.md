Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussions on the 23rd.

The representatives and heads of various departments of state who spoke at the meeting included: Soong Ching Ling, Lin Tie, Lin Feng, Chen Shutong, Jin Zhonghua, Zhang Huiting, Cheng Qian, Shen Yanbing, Li Tao, Yu Yanong, Ma John, Ulanhu, Liu Xianzhou, Jia Tuofu, and others, fourteen in total.

Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, pointed out in her speech today that the First Five-Year Plan is a plan for the Chinese people to build socialism with creative labor, a plan that is related to the happiness of our country's 600 million people and their descendants, and also a plan through which we will make significant contributions to world peace and human prosperity. She said that this plan will undoubtedly stir up a universal surge of labor enthusiasm among our people and will also be eagerly watched and welcomed by peace-loving people in all countries.

Soong Ching Ling went on to describe her impressions and gains from her recent inspection work in various places. She pointed out that the campaign to increase production and practice economy, which is being carried out vigorously in factories, is a key issue in the construction of the Five-Year Plan, in tapping the potential of existing industries, and accumulating funds for national industrialization. The Party's General Line has penetrated deeply into the countryside, and the peasants have a deep understanding of the dead end of the small-peasant economy and the need to organize and gradually realize the socialist transformation.

Soong Ching Ling emphasized that two issues should be given importance in the countryside: the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the strengthening of education on the worker-peasant alliance. She said: The general reaction of the peasants to the unified purchase and sale is good. After the implementation of the "three fix" policy, there are clear targets for increased production, and the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. She said: There are some people at home and abroad who do not want China to build socialism and are trying to sow discord between our workers and peasants, attempting to undermine our worker-peasant alliance. They say: "The peasants are too bitter." Some people abroad also say that China's industrialization is "at the expense of agriculture and the needs of the people." The intention of those who say these things is to prevent China from implementing socialist industrialization and to keep Chinese peasants forever in the poverty and backwardness of the small-peasant economy. However, history will not go backwards, and the plans of these people will absolutely not succeed.

When talking about the current international situation, Soong Ching Ling said: New China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Together with other peace-loving countries, we have made unremitting and significant efforts to ease international tensions and have achieved some success. We welcome all efforts aimed at further easing the international situation. Currently in Geneva, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France are holding their first meeting in ten years since the war. We welcome the convening of this meeting. We hope that the meeting will strive to find ways to restore mutual trust between the major powers and create conditions for solving all outstanding international issues. In this meeting, the heads of government of the four major powers will have to discuss the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, as well as easing international tensions, which are of concern to people all over the world. The firm expressions and sincere efforts made by Soviet Chairman Bulganin to promote international peace and cooperation have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. U.S. President Eisenhower also recently stated that the United States believes in negotiations and friendly meetings, and he also expressed his willingness to "respond to a universal and urgent demand, which Premier Bulganin acknowledged in his July 15th speech, that the political leaders of our great powers find a path to peace." People are eagerly waiting for such rhetoric to become concrete action, so that there is a good prospect for world peace. We hope that this meeting will not disappoint the people of the world.

Representative Lin Tie stated in his speech that Hebei Province will adopt active measures to steadily develop the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, harness rivers, build farmland water conservancy projects, vigorously carry out flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought prevention work, expand the planting area of high-yield crops, improve land utilization, and continue to improve and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, in order to complete and overfulfill the grain and cotton production increase tasks assigned to Hebei Province in the First Five-Year Plan.

Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, made a speech on cultural and educational work. Lin Feng said: In order to adapt to the needs of our country's economic construction and improve the people's cultural living standards, all cultural and educational work in the future should be based on the original work, with improving quality as the focus, planned, focused, and steadily developed, while implementing the principle of rational deployment in regional distribution and overall planning in public and private undertakings. The primary task of cultural and educational work is to vigorously train construction cadres, especially technical cadres and management cadres for industrial construction. The cadres we train must be loyal to the motherland and the cause of socialist construction, capable of mastering modern scientific and technological knowledge, and healthy. The work of training cadres should be carried out mainly from two aspects: on the one hand, training through higher education and secondary specialized education; in the future, we should correctly combine improving quality and increasing quantity. On the other hand, training through spare-time education, so that a large number of on-the-job cadres and workers can systematically improve their cultural and scientific level.

In addition to training a large number of construction cadres, it is also necessary to gradually improve the people's cultural living standards.

In the future, various methods should be adopted, including encouraging self-run methods by the masses, to plan the development of grassroots cultural and educational undertakings. Special attention should be paid to cultural and educational work in ethnic minority areas to provide assistance.

At present, there is a serious phenomenon of waste in the cultural and educational departments. Therefore, practicing strict economy to provide more funds for industrial construction is also an important task for the cultural and educational departments.

Finally, Lin Feng talked about the issue of socialist ideological construction. He said: In order to make cultural and educational work better serve socialist construction, it is necessary to improve the political and ideological level of all cultural and educational workers, thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealist thinking, and earnestly rectify the cultural and educational ranks, eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries in the cultural and educational departments, and overcome the erroneous tendency of cultural and educational work to deviate from Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party. What is particularly important is that all cultural and educational workers must recognize that work can only be done well with the leadership of the Communist Party.

Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, pointed out in his speech that the Five-Year Plan is closely related to the people of all classes and strata throughout the country. The people of the whole country must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, guarantee the successful completion of this plan with concrete actions. He particularly mentioned the responsibilities of the industrial and commercial circles, saying that private industrial and commercial enterprises still account for a considerable proportion in the First Five-Year Plan and still have their important role, making certain contributions to the country and the people. The industrial and commercial circles should pay stricter attention to abiding by the Five-Year Plan, because the industrial and commercial circles are the most vulnerable link in the enemy's conspiracy to attack. Some people are still wavering about socialist transformation, some are still operating passively, some are not discerning and lack vigilance; and a small number of people are still repeating the "five poisons," and some even have illegal behaviors of resisting leadership and sabotaging socialist transformation. This cannot be tolerated. In the future, private industrialists and businessmen must further heighten their vigilance, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, abide by the law, obey the plan, improve management, practice strict economy, and use the practical actions of actively accepting leadership and actively accepting socialist transformation to counter the enemy's sabotage conspiracy, honestly, diligently, and together with the people of the whole country, strive towards the future of socialist construction.

Representative Jin Zhonghua said in his speech that the ideal of building socialism, which the Chinese people have been pursuing for many years, has begun to become a reality. The advance of our great cause will not be smooth sailing. There will be complex and sharp class struggles. We intellectuals must seriously learn lessons from the counter-revolutionary incidents of Hu Feng and Pan Hannian, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely overcome the tendency of being detached from politics, strictly criticize liberalism and paralyzing thoughts, and temper and transform ourselves in complex and sharp class struggles. Our cultural and educational workers must purify their ranks, strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, participate in the construction of the motherland with the greatest enthusiasm, and defend our cause with infinite loyalty.

The speech of Zhang Huiting, a representative of Anhui Province and a model agricultural laborer, aroused great interest among the representatives in the audience. His simple, fully expressing the peasants' sincere feelings, and full of confidence words, constantly won warm applause. Zhang Huiting said: The Five-Year Plan is the direction of socialism and the road of socialism. With a direction and a road, the peasants have a goal to strive for, and their enthusiasm is even greater. He said that before liberation, his family was broken and scattered, and only after liberation did his whole family reunite, and he was allocated land, participated in mutual aid teams and cooperatives, grew more grain, and had no worries about food and clothing, living a good life that he had never dreamed of in the past. Zhang Huiting talked about the government's concern when his hometown suffered from major floods and snow disasters last year. He said that in the days of the Kuomintang, there were only two paths, either drowning and starvation, or the whole family fleeing famine; now, although they encountered a major flood that had not been heard of for hundreds of years, not only did no one die, but no one fled the famine, and the government also helped rescue cattle. He expressed that he would work harder in the future to increase production, harvest more grain, reduce the burden of state relief, and support industrialization. He said that in order to grow more grain and increase income, the peasants should listen to Chairman Mao and take the road of collectivization.

Representative Cheng Qian pointed out in his speech: The illusions of all naive reformists in China who wanted to carry out economic construction in China in the past were shattered in the face of cruel reality, and this was because "without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry." He said that now we have a new China with the prerequisite conditions for developing industry, so we can follow the path of socialism and start the construction of developing the national economy. People relive the painful lessons of history, look forward to the brilliant socialist prospects, and cannot but sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong for leading the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory and continuing to lead the Chinese people towards the socialist goal.

Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, said that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident has particularly serious and profound educational significance for the cultural and artistic circles. This incident shows that there are still bourgeois ideas in the cultural front, such as non-political tendencies, detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, and neglect of national cultural and artistic traditions. Shen Yanbing said: Cultural work is an important component of the ideological front. The current task of cultural work is to use socialist ideology to educate and encourage the masses to strive for the construction of a socialist society. To accomplish this task, we must first vigorously develop literary and artistic creations with correct ideological content and a certain artistic level, especially vigorously develop literary and artistic works that are loved and welcomed by the masses, and widely popularize the fruits of creation among the masses, constantly consolidating and expanding the socialist ideological position, resisting and weakening the erosion of bourgeois ideology on the masses. In order to accomplish this task well, we must have a cultural team that is pure and sound ideologically, politically, and organizationally. Therefore, the primary task of current cultural and artistic work is to strive to rectify, strengthen, and build our team ideologically, politically, and organizationally, eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other hidden counter-revolutionaries, criticize the reactionary ideology of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and various forms of bourgeois erroneous ideas, and constantly improve ideological level, and improve the combat effectiveness and ideological nature of cultural work.

Representative Li Tao pointed out in his speech: The state has a large investment in basic construction in Liaoning Province, with many new and expanded key projects, and the existing industrial production tasks are very heavy. The primary task of the people of Liaoning Province during the First Five-Year Plan period is to ensure that the state's key basic construction projects in Liaoning Province are of good quality, low cost, completed on time, and put into production on time; at the same time, we must give full play to the role of existing industries, actively produce, strive to increase new varieties, improve quality, reduce costs, and provide more and better industrial products for the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, and even more so, manufacture new equipment, train technical personnel and workers for new factories and mines, and accumulate funds for the country. Liaoning Province will, on the existing basis, further rely on and mobilize the masses to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement in depth, so as to ensure the completion of the glorious tasks assigned by the state.

Representative Yu Yanong of Anhui Province said: Anhui Province is a province that has historically suffered many disasters. In the few years after liberation, in addition to completing various tasks like all parts of the country, the people of Anhui had to use their greatest efforts to overcome various natural disasters. Last year was the year with the biggest and heaviest disasters in Anhui since liberation, but thanks to the joint efforts of the Communist Party and the People's Government in leading the people of the whole province, and the care and strong assistance of the central government and the people of the whole country, they finally overcame the disaster and ensured that no one starved to death. On behalf of the people of Anhui, he expressed his deepest gratitude to the central government and the people of the whole country for their care and support to the people of Anhui.

Representative Ma John said: The health of the people is one of the important basic forces in economic construction. In implementing the First Five-Year Plan, we must attach importance to improving the people's health level. To enhance physical fitness and obtain health, physical exercise is an important measure. This requires carrying out mass sports activities, especially the Labor and Defense System movement.

Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his speech that the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country embodies the long-term interests of all ethnic groups in our country. In the First Five-Year Plan, some major construction projects are distributed in ethnic minority areas. These large-scale constructions are rapidly changing the face of the local socio-economy, bringing great benefits to the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country and locally, and the people of all ethnic groups in the local area should make every effort to support these constructions. All major construction projects in the Five-Year Plan, no matter where they are distributed, are the common wealth of all ethnic groups in our country and the foundation of the prosperity and happiness of all ethnic groups in our country. It can be foreseen that after the country's heavy industry construction has laid a certain foundation, the country will have the possibility and will certainly carry out more industrial construction in ethnic minority areas, and then the speed of industrial development in various ethnic minority areas will certainly not be slow but very rapid. Ulanhu said that the Five-Year Plan has appropriate provisions for the construction of local industries in ethnic minority areas, for the development of agricultural, pastoral, and forestry production, and for the development of cultural education, medical and health undertakings, etc. It can be seen that the First Five-Year Plan fully takes into account the needs of the construction of all ethnic minority areas throughout the country.

Ulanhu pointed out that under the guidance of the great Five-Year Plan, the people of all ethnic minorities in our country should give full play to their initiative, work hard, support the construction of the motherland, and build our local areas of this nation in the construction of our great motherland. The close unity of all ethnic groups is an important condition for building socialism in our country. In order to realize our country's First Five-Year Plan, we must also continue to enhance the unity and brotherly friendship between all ethnic groups.

Based on his experience in education and scientific work, Representative Liu Xianzhou expressed his views in his speech on issues such as the excessive pursuit of quantity and neglect of quality in the enrollment of institutions of higher learning, the insufficient attention to the leadership of political and ideological work in institutions of higher learning, and the insufficient organization and planning of scientific research work. He believes that the principles of training cadres in institutions of higher learning in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, the regulations on strengthening the leadership of political and ideological work in institutions of higher learning and related scientific research work in the draft First Five-Year Plan are all very correct and necessary.

Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council and Minister of Light Industry, pointed out in his speech that the total output value of light industrial products nationwide has increased two times in the past three years of recovery and two years of construction, basically ensuring the market supply and social needs of previous years, ensuring a certain improvement in people's living standards, and becoming an important source of funds for national construction accumulation. However, the people's need for light industrial products, especially in terms of clothing and food, is growing faster than the growth of production, which is still the basic trend in the future. This trend reflects the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production in our country, the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, and will continue to promote the upsurge of our country's national economy. The various planned indicators and measures of the First Five-Year Plan regarding light industry are appropriate and correct, because in order to fully develop the national economy and ensure national defense, our country must give priority to the development of heavy industry, and light industry should and can only develop accordingly. At the same time, the production potential of light industry in our country is very large, and many production capacities have not yet been utilized. At present, the main reason why the production of many light industries cannot grow faster is the insufficient supply of raw materials. If the light industry sector can make various efforts in saving raw materials, reducing waste products, second-class products, and other aspects, the difficulty of raw materials can still be reduced, and production can be increased accordingly.

Jia Tuofu said that private industry and handicrafts still have a major role in supplying people's daily necessities. The state should strengthen their socialist transformation and arrange their production industry by industry according to the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration. Private industry and handicrafts themselves should also actively improve their production and management.

Jia Tuofu pointed out that by 1957, relying on tapping the existing production potential of light industry, plus the result of putting newly built and renovated projects into production, the production of several major products will have a large increase, which can basically meet the needs of people's lives. In a country like ours, the growth of social needs always comes before production. We must do everything possible to increase production in order to gradually meet the growing needs of the people.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Guo Moruo, Li Xuefeng, Ke Qingshi, Wei Guoqing, Lü Hongbin, and Huang Changshui.

Today's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and adjourned at 7:15 p.m.

Tomorrow is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day according to the meeting agenda. The plenary discussion will continue on the 25th.

    全国人民代表大会第二次会议
    继续进行大会讨论
    新华社二十三日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议二十三日继续进行大会讨论。
    在大会上先后发言的代表和国家机关各部门负责人有：宋庆龄、林铁、林枫、陈叔通、金仲华、张会亭、程潜、沈雁冰、李涛、余亚农、马约翰、乌兰夫、刘仙洲、贾拓夫等十四人。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄今天在会上发言时首先指出，第一个五年计划是中国人民用创造性的劳动来建设社会主义的计划，是关系着我国六亿人民和子孙后代的幸福生活的计划，也是我们将会对世界和平和人类繁荣作出重大贡献的计划。她说，这个计划无疑地将在我们全国人民中掀起普遍高涨的劳动热情，同时也将受到世界各国爱好和平的人们的热切关注和欢迎。
    宋庆龄在发言中接着叙述了她最近到各地视察工作的感想和收获。她指出：在工厂中正热烈展开的增产节约运动，这是五年计划建设中发挥现有工业潜在力量、为国家工业化积累资金的一个关键性的问题。党的总路线已经深入农村，农民对于小农经济的没有出路和必须组织起来逐步实现社会主义改造，有了深切的体会。
    宋庆龄强调提出在农村中应该重视两个问题，这就是贯彻粮食统购统销政策和加强工农联盟教育。她说：农民对于统购统销的一般反应是良好的。实行“三定”政策后，增产有了目标，农民的生产积极性就更加提高了。她说：国内外有一些不愿意中国建设社会主义的人，正在挑拨我们的工农关系，企图破坏我们的工农联盟。他们说：“农民太苦了”。国外也有人说：中国的工业化是“以农业和人民的需要为牺牲的”。说这种话的人的意思，是希望中国不实行社会主义工业化，要使中国农民永远停留在小农经济的贫困落后的状态。但是，历史不会走回头路，这些人的打算是绝对不会成功的。
    宋庆龄在谈到目前的国际形势问题时说：新中国一贯执行着和平外交政策。我们同其他爱好和平的国家一道，对缓和国际紧张局势作了不懈的重大努力，并已取得一些成就。我们欢迎一切旨在促使国际局势进一步缓和的努力。目前在日内瓦，正举行着苏、美、英、法四大国政府首脑在战后十年来的第一次集会。我们欢迎这个会议的召开。我们希望会议努力寻取恢复大国之间相互信任的办法，为解决一切悬而未决的国际问题创造条件。四大国政府首脑在这次会议中将不能不讨论到全世界人民所关心的裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及缓和国际紧张局势的问题。苏联布尔加宁主席为了增进国际和平合作而作的坚定表示和真诚努力，已得到全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎。美国艾森豪威尔总统最近也表示，美国相信谈判，相信友好的会议，他也表示愿意“响应一个普遍的迫切的要求，这是布尔加宁总理在他的七月十五日的演说里所承认了的，即我们大国的政治领袖们要找出一条通向和平的道路。”人们正迫切地期待这种言论成为具体的行动，这样世界和平才有可能出现良好的前景。我们希望这次会议不要使世界人民失望。
    林铁代表在发言中提出，河北省将采取积极措施，稳步地发展农业互助合作运动，治理河流，兴办农田水利，大力进行防洪、防涝、防旱工作，扩大高产作物种植面积，提高土地利用率，继续改进和加强对农业生产的领导，以完成和超额完成第一个五年计划规定的河北省粮棉增产任务。
    国务院第二办公室主任林枫作了关于文化教育工作的发言。林枫说：为着适应我国经济建设和提高人民文化生活水平的要求，今后各项文教工作应在原有的工作基础上，以提高质量为重点，有计划有重点地稳步发展，同时贯彻在地区分布上的合理部署和公私事业上的统筹安排的方针。文教工作的首要任务是大力培养各项建设干部，特别是工业建设的技术干部和管理干部。我们培养的干部，必须是忠实于祖国和社会主义建设事业、能够掌握现代科学技术知识、和身体健康的人。培养干部的工作，主要应从两方面来进行：一方面，由高等教育和中等专业教育来培养，今后应使提高质量和增加数量正确地结合起来。另一方面，要由业余教育来培养，使大量在职干部和职工群众能够系统地提高文化科学水平。
    除大量培养建设干部外，还必须逐步提高人民文化生活水平。
    今后应采取各种办法，包括鼓励群众自办的办法，有计划发展基层文化教育事业。对少数民族地区的文教工作应特别注意用力帮助。
    目前文教部门存在着严重的浪费现象，因此，厉行节约，为工业建设提供更多的资金，也是文教部门一项重要的任务。
    最后，林枫谈到了社会主义思想建设的问题。他说：为了使文教工作更好地为社会主义建设服务，必须提高全体文教工作人员的政治思想水平，彻底批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，并切实整顿文教队伍，清除文教部门中的暗藏反革命分子，克服文教工作中脱离马克思列宁主义和党的领导的错误倾向。特别重要的是，一切文教工作人员必须认识只有依靠共产党的领导才能做好工作。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通在发言中指出，五年计划同全国各阶级各阶层的人民都有密切的关系。全国人民必须在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，以具体行动来保证这个计划的胜利完成。他特别提到工商界的责任说，私营工商业在第一个五年计划中还占着相当大的比重，还有它的重要作用，对国家、对人民可以作出一定的贡献。工商界更应该严格注意遵守五年计划，因为在敌人的阴谋进攻中，工商界是一个最脆弱的环节。有些人对于社会主义改造还在动摇，有些人依然消极经营，有些人眼睛不亮，警惕性不高；还有少数人仍在重犯“五毒”，有的甚至有抵抗领导、破坏社会主义改造的不法行为。这是不能容许的。今后私营工商业者必须进一步提高警惕，划清敌我界限，遵守法律，服从计划，改善经营，厉行节约，以积极接受领导，积极接受社会主义改造的实际行动来还击敌人的破坏阴谋，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，和全国人民一起，向着社会主义建设的前途努力迈进。
    金仲华代表在发言中说，中国人民许多年来所追求的建设社会主义的理想，已经开始成为事实了。我们伟大事业的前进，不会是风平浪静的。而是有复杂和尖锐的阶级斗争。我们知识分子必须从胡风和潘汉年的反革命事件中认真吸取教训，百倍提高警惕，坚决克服脱离政治的倾向，严格地批判自由主义和麻痹思想，从复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己。我们文教工作者必须纯洁自己的队伍，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，以最大热情来参加祖国建设，以无限忠诚来保卫我们的事业。
    安徽省代表、农业劳动模范张会亭的讲话引起了全场代表们极大的兴趣。他的质朴的、充分表达农民的真挚感情的、信心充沛的话，不断博得了热烈的掌声。张会亭说：五年计划就是社会主义的方向和社会主义的道路。有了方向，有了道路，农民就有了奔头，劲头就更大了。他说，解放前他家破人散，解放后才全家团圆，又分了土地，参加了互助组、合作社，多打了粮食，吃穿都不愁，过上了过去做梦也没想到的好日子。张会亭谈到去年他的家乡闹大水、大雪灾时受到政府关怀的情形。他说，要是国民党时候，只有两条路，不是淹死饿死，就是全家逃荒；如今虽然遇到了几百年没听说过的大水灾，但是不光没死人，也没有逃荒的，政府还帮助抢救耕牛。他表示今后要更加努力增产，多收粮食，减轻国家救济负担，来支援工业化。他说为了多打粮食增加收入，农民就要听毛主席的话，走合作化的道路。
    程潜代表在发言中指出：中国过去一切天真的改良主义者想在中国进行经济建设的幻想，都在残酷的现实面前碰得头破血流，这就是因为“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业”。他说，现在我们有了一个新中国，具备了发展工业的前提条件，因此我们能够循着社会主义的轨道，着手进行发展国民经济的建设事业。人们重温历史的惨痛教训，瞻望光辉灿烂的社会主义远景，不能不由衷地感激领导中国人民取得革命胜利、并领导中国人民继续朝着社会主义目标前进的中国共产党和毛泽东主席。
    文化部部长沈雁冰说，胡风反革命集团的事件，对于文化艺术界有着特别严重的和深刻的教育意义。从这个事件说明文化战线还存在着非政治倾向、脱离群众、脱离实际、轻视民族文化艺术传统等资产阶级思想。沈雁冰说：文化工作是思想战线上的一个重要的组成部分。当前文化工作的任务，就是要用社会主义思想去教育和鼓舞人民群众为建成社会主义社会而奋斗。我们要完成这个任务，首先要大力发展具有正确思想内容和一定艺术水平的文学艺术创作，特别要大力发展为群众所喜闻乐见的文学艺术作品，并把创作的成果广泛地普及到人民群众中去，不断地巩固和扩大社会主义思想的阵地，抵制和削弱资产阶级思想对人民群众的侵蚀。为了很好地完成这个任务，我们必须有一支在思想上政治上和组织上纯洁而健全的文化队伍。因此，当前文化艺术工作的首要任务，就是要从思想上、政治上和组织上努力整顿、加强和建设我们的队伍，肃清胡风反革命集团和其他一切暗藏反革命分子，批判胡风反革命集团的反动思想和各种形式的资产阶级错误思想，不断提高思想水平，提高文化工作的战斗性和思想性。
    李涛代表在发言中指出：国家在辽宁省的基本建设投资很大，新建扩建重点工程很多，现有工业生产任务很重。辽宁省人民在第一个五年计划时期中的首要任务，就是要保证国家在辽宁省的基本建设重点工程质量好，造价低，并按时竣工，按时投入生产；同时要充分发挥现有工业的作用，积极生产，努力增加新品种，提高质量，降低成本，为工农业生产和人民生活的需要，提供更多更好的工业品，更要为新建的厂矿制造新装备，培养技术人员和工人，为国家积累资金。辽宁省将在现有的基础上进一步依靠和发动群众，把增产节约运动深入开展起来，以保证完成国家所交给的光荣任务。
    安徽省代表余亚农说：安徽省是一个历史上多灾的省份，解放后几年，安徽人民除了要和全国各地一样地去完成各项任务之外，还得用最大的力量去战胜各种自然灾害。去年是安徽解放以来灾情最大最重的一年，但由于共产党和人民政府领导全省人民一致努力，中央和全国人民的关怀和大力援助，终于渡过了灾情困难，做到了救灾不饿死人。他代表安徽人民，对于中央和全国人民给予安徽人民的关怀和支援，表示最深切的感谢。
    马约翰代表说：人民的健康，是经济建设中重要的基本力量之一。在执行第一个五年计划时，必须重视人民健康水平的提高。要增强体质，获得健康，锻炼身体是一项重要的措施。这就需要开展群众体育运动，特别是劳卫制运动。
    国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫在发言中说，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划体现了我国各族人民长远的利益。在第一个五年计划中，有些重大的建设工程是分布在少数民族地区的。这些规模巨大的建设在迅速的改变着当地社会经济的面貌，给全国和当地各族人民带来了巨大的利益，当地各族人民应尽一切努力，来支援这些建设。所有五年计划中的重大建设项目，不论分布在那里，都是我国各族人民的共同财富，是我国各族人民繁荣和幸福的基础。可以预计，在国家的重工业建设奠定了一定基础之后，国家就有了可能也就一定会在少数民族地区进行更多的工业建设，那时各少数民族地区工业的发展速度，就一定不是很慢而是很迅速的。乌兰夫说五年计划中对少数民族地区地方工业的建设，对于农、牧、林业生产的发展以及文化教育、医药卫生事业的发展等，都有适当的规定。可见第一个五年计划是充分照顾了全国各少数民族地区建设的需要。
    乌兰夫指出：我国各少数民族人民在伟大的五年计划指引下，应该充分发挥自己的积极性，艰苦奋斗，支援祖国的建设，在我们伟大祖国的建设中来建设我们本民族的地方。各民族的亲密团结是在我国建成社会主义的一个重要条件。为了实现我国的第一个五年计划，我们还必须不懈地继续增强各民族间的团结和兄弟般的友谊。
    刘仙洲代表根据他在教育工作和科学工作中的体会，在发言中对高等学校招生中过于追求数量、忽视质量，高等学校中不够重视政治思想工作的领导，科学研究工作的组织性计划性不够等问题发表了意见。他认为李富春副总理报告中关于高等学校培养干部的原则，第一个五年计划草案中对高等学校加强政治思想工作的领导和有关科学研究工作的规定，都是十分正确和必要的。
    国务院第四办公室主任兼轻工业部部长贾拓夫在发言中指出：全国轻工业产品的总产值在过去三年恢复和两年建设期间已经增加了两倍，基本上保证了历年的市场供应和社会需要，保证了人民生活水平一定的提高，并成为国家积累建设资金的重要源泉。但是人民对轻工业品需要，特别在衣、食两方面，增长的速度超过了生产增长的速度，仍是今后的基本趋势，这种趋势反映出我国工农业生产的不断增长，人民购买力的不断提高，并将不断地推动我国国民经济的高涨。第一个五年计划关于轻工业的各项计划指标和措施是适当的和正确的，因为我们国家为了全面发展国民经济，保证国防，必须优先发展重工业，轻工业应该也只能是相应的发展。同时我国轻工业的生产潜力很大，有许多生产能力至今尚未利用。目前许多轻工业生产不能更快增长，主要是由于原料供应不足，如果轻工业部门能够从节约原料，降低废品、次品率以及其他方面进行各种努力，原料的困难还是可以缩小的，生产也可以相应增加。
    贾拓夫说，私营工业和手工业在供应人民生活必需品方面，还有重大的作用。国家应加强对它们的社会主义改造，并根据统筹兼顾的方针，逐行逐业地安排它们的生产。私营工业、手工业本身也应积极改善自己的生产和经营管理。
    贾拓夫指出：到一九五七年，轻工业依靠发挥现有生产潜力，加上新建改建项目的投入生产的结果，几项主要产品的生产量将有很大增长，基本上可以满足人民生活需要。在我们这样的国家，社会需要的增长总是走在生产前面的，我们必须尽一切可能来努力增加生产，以求逐步满足人民日益增长的需要。
    今天会议的执行主席是：郭沫若、李雪峰、柯庆施、韦国清、吕鸿宾、黄长水。
    今天的会议从下午三时开始，七时十五分休会。
    明天是星期日，按照会议议程休会一天。二十五日继续进行大会讨论。
