Changes Along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Line
　　Yu Zheng

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the first railway built by the people themselves after liberation, has been open to traffic for three years.

From Chengdu to Chongqing, many places along the railway have changed their original appearance. Dongsunba, where the Tongguanyi Railway Station is located, used to be a barren hillside. Now, a huge mechanized brick and tile factory has been built here. In 1954, it shipped nearly 100,000 tons of bricks and tiles to support basic construction. Department stores, cooperatives, and banks have also opened here, turning it into a prosperous market town. Another example is the location of the 507 Power Plant, which used to be a wasteland covered with weeds. Now, tall factory buildings have been built, and towering chimneys stand tall, supplying electricity to more than a thousand factories of all sizes. In Neijiang, Longchang, and other places, many newly built factories can be seen.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has actively supported oil exploration work, assisting the exploration area in transporting heavy and large drilling machines to the construction site quickly and safely. Coal in Yongchuan, Longchang, Weiyuan, and other places could not be transported out in the past due to inconvenient transportation. The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has closely linked the producing and selling areas, and the transportation problem has been solved. Now, Weiyuan, Yongchuan, and other coal mines are undergoing huge expansion projects.

Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," and the area along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is even more fertile. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, many products were stockpiled in the producing areas, and many local specialties could not be transported to the places where people needed them most. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, many products were shipped out. Hemp from western Sichuan used to be transported to Chongqing by truck, with a freight cost of more than 120 yuan per ton, resulting in high prices and poor sales. Now, the train freight is only 13.4 yuan per ton, the price has been reduced, and the product is selling well. In 1954 alone, Chengdu Railway Station exported more than 5.5 million jin of hemp. This exported hemp not only supplied the needs of industry in the Southwest but also transported to Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has transported a large number of new-style agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers to the countryside in a timely manner. Farmers use new-style agricultural tools and machines to fight against nature, turning places covered with weeds into farmland, turning dry land into paddy fields, and land that originally grew one crop a season can now grow two or three crops. In 1954, eight pumping stations were established in the Jiangjin area, which played a significant role in drought resistance this year, irrigating 685 mu of dry land and retaining moisture to protect seedlings on more than 2,960 mu. Farmers along the line have purchased and used chemical fertilizers, resulting in unprecedented harvests for many crops. Xiao Ziliang, a sugarcane farmer in Songlin Township, Neijiang City, has been growing sugarcane for more than 20 years. In the past, he could only harvest about 2,000 jin per mu. Thanks to the use of chemical fertilizers, he can now harvest 5,000 jin per mu. He said: "Without the support of our worker brothers, how could we have such a bumper harvest?"

The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has greatly reduced the price difference between industrial and agricultural products. The prices of agricultural products along the railway line, which were very low in the past, have now increased; things that could not be sold in the past are now being sold. According to a survey in Ziyang County, compared with the market price in the first quarter of 1952, rice has increased by 15 percent, pork has increased by 40 percent, and vegetables have increased by about four times. This shows that the income of farmers has generally increased. The selling price of industrial products along the railway line is generally almost the same as that in Chongqing, and anything that can be bought in Chongqing can also be bought in various places along the line.

Newspapers published in Chengdu and Chongqing can generally be seen in the counties and cities along the line on the same day or the next day. People who are seriously ill or injured can be sent to hospitals with more complete equipment in Chongqing or Chengdu for treatment in a timely manner. The benefits of the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are endless.

These changes that have taken place along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway tell us why the people of Sichuan longed to build a railway in their hometown. At the same time, it also tells us that thousands of socialist construction projects are underway in our country's vast and magnificent land, which is the foundation of our country's prosperity and strength, and the source of our happy life.

### 成渝铁路沿线的变化

　　成渝铁路沿线的变化
　　余正
    解放以后用人民自己的力量修建起来的第一条铁路——成渝铁路全线通车，已经三周年了。
    从成都到重庆，紧靠铁路的两旁，许多地方，已经改变了原来的面貌。铜罐驿车站所在地冬笋坝，以前是一片荒山坡，现在这里已经建成了巨大的机制砖瓦厂，一九五四年就在这里发送了近十万吨的砖瓦，支援基本建设；这里还开设起了百货商店、合作社、银行。它变成了一个繁荣的集镇。又如五○七发电厂所在地，以前是一片长着乱草的荒地，现在已经建起了高大的厂房，矗立起高大的烟囱，向一千多个大小工厂输送着电力。在内江、隆昌等地，都可以看到许多新建的工厂。
    成渝铁路积极地支援了石油的钻探工作，它协助探区将沉重、庞大的钻探机器，迅速、安全地运到了工地。永川、隆昌、威远等地的煤炭，以前由于交通不便，产品运不出去，成渝铁路通车，将产区和销区紧密地联系起来，运输问题解决了。现在威远、永川等煤矿，都在进行着巨大的扩建工程。
    四川被称为“天府之国”，成渝铁路沿线更是富饶的地区。以往由于交通不便，很多产品被积压在产地，很多土特产不能运到人民最需要的地方去，成渝铁路通车以后，许多产品运出去了。川西的大麻，以前用汽车运到重庆，每吨运费需要一百二十多元，因而售价高，销路不好；现在火车运价每吨十三元四角多，售价降低了，产品畅销。一九五四年仅成都车站就输出大麻五百五十多万斤。这些输出的大麻，不仅供应了西南工业上的需要，而且还运到天津、上海等地。
    成渝铁路将大批的新式农具和化学肥料，及时地运到了农村。农民使用新式农具、机器同自然作斗争，使长着乱草的地方变成了农田，使旱田变成了水田，原来种一季的田地，现在能种二季、三季了。一九五四年江津专区建立了八处抽水站，今年在抗旱工作中就发挥了很大的作用，灌溉了旱田六百八十五亩，渗水保苗二千九百六十多亩。沿线农民买到并使用了化学肥料，使许多农作物得到空前的丰收。内江市郊区松林乡的蔗农萧子良，种了二十多年的甘蔗，以前一亩地只能收获二千市斤左右，由于使用了化学肥料，一亩地已能收获五千市斤。他说：“没有工人老大哥的支援，我们怎么会有这样的丰收啊。”
    成渝铁路通车，使工、农业产品差价大大缩小了。铁路沿线以前价钱很低的农产品，现在提高了；以前卖不出去的东西，现在卖出去了。根据资阳县的调查，现在和一九五二年第一季度的市价作比较，米提高百分之十五，猪肉提高百分之四十，小菜约提高四倍。这说明农民的收入普遍增加。而工业品的售价，铁路沿线一般的几乎和重庆拉平，而且在重庆能买到的，在沿线各地也能买到。
    沿线县市一般的都在当天或第二天，就可以看到成都、重庆出版的报纸。有人患了重病，受了伤，可以及时地送到重庆或成都设备比较完善的医院医治。成渝铁路通车的好处是说不完的。
    成渝铁路沿线所发生的这些变化告诉我们：四川人民为什么渴望着在自己的家乡修一条铁路。同时它也告诉我们：在祖国辽阔而壮丽的土地上，正在进行着千百个社会主义建设的工程，那就是我们祖国繁荣富强的基础，那就是我们幸福生活的源泉。（附图片）
