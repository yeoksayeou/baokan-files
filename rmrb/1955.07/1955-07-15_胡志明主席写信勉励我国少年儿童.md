Dear Chinese Children,

Comrade Zuo Lin, Editor-in-Chief of "China Children's Newspaper," asked me to write a few words to you. What I want to say is—

1.  Vietnamese children want me to convey their dearest friendship to you.
2.  I love you as much as I love Vietnamese children.
3.  Uncle Mao teaches you "Five Loves," and I also learn from Uncle Mao to teach Vietnamese children "Five Loves." I hope Chinese children will compete with Vietnamese children to see who does the "Five Loves" best.

I kiss you, your old Uncle Ho Chi Minh.
