    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Academy of Sciences Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Continues
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 3rd: According to TASS, the conference of the Soviet Academy of Sciences discussing scientific and technological issues related to the peaceful use of atomic energy continued in Moscow on the 2nd. On that day, the departments of Physics and Mathematics, Technical Sciences, Chemistry, and Biology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences held meetings. Soviet scientific experts reported on the use of radiation to improve technical operations, for physiology and medicine, and other aspects.
    The meeting held by the Department of Physics and Mathematics discussed some physics problems related to the basic principles of new technological sectors using atomic energy. At the meeting, Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Kozinets, and Soviet Corresponding Academician Frank, reported on the research results on the development of nuclear chain reactions in various systems containing uranium and moderators (graphite, heavy water). Several other academic reports pointed out methods for determining several physical constants needed when calculating nuclear reactions.
    At the meeting of the Department of Technical Sciences, the scientists present discussed the summary of the method of using radioactive indicators in the research of metallurgical technology. The joint report by Soviet Corresponding Academician Samarin and engineer Kalinnikov pointed out that according to the results of using tracer atoms to study various refractory materials built in steel ladles and steel tapping troughs in the "electric steel factory," it was found that the best refractory material is high alumina brick (with the greatest stability), which greatly helps to reduce non-metallic impurities in the steel. The meeting also heard reports on using radiography to study impurities in metals.
    The meeting held by the Department of Chemistry discussed issues related to radiation chemistry. Candidate of Chemical Sciences Karpov talked about the role of radiation on polymer compounds in his report. Professor Bach, Doctor of Chemistry, talked about the research results on the role of radiation on inorganic salt solutions. The meeting also heard a report on the kinetics of redox and the simplest radiation chemical reactions.
    The various reports made at the meeting of the Department of Biology introduced new research on the effects of ion radiation on animal and plant organisms.
    The conference of the Soviet Academy of Sciences discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy is still continuing.
    New Achievements of the Soviet Union in Applying Atomic Energy in Industrial Production
    The Soviet Union has recently made new achievements in the application of atomic energy in industrial production.
    In the steel industry, the Chelyabinsk Iron and Steel Plant has used "tracer" atoms to study the smelting process of advanced steel, thus clarifying the reasons for the penetration of impurities into the molten steel, solving other production problems, and improving the quality of the smelted steel. The factory is also using radioactive isotopes to study the melting time of open-hearth furnace materials. According to preliminary research results, the use of radioactive isotopes can greatly shorten the steelmaking time and greatly increase the production efficiency of the open-hearth furnace.
    In the oil industry, the geological staff and drilling personnel of the Tatar Oil Trust have begun to apply radioactive isotopes to oil drilling. They use a special instrument to record the fission intensity of radioactive isotopes contained in the mineral layer, and then use the curve on the photographic film in the instrument to find out the mineral deposits of oil. Recently, various oil fields in Tatarstan have also injected radioactive isotope liquid into the oil mineral layer in production, and then understand the current situation of the oil well according to its flow route in the mineral layer.
    The Soviet Union will give Czechoslovakia an Atomic Reactor
    Čestmír Jech, Director of the Institute of Physics of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, said on June 30: The Soviet Union will give Czechoslovakia a 2,000-kilowatt atomic reactor, which can be used for any kind of research in nuclear physics and neutron physics, can be used for research on power reactors, can be used to produce radioactive isotopes, and can also be used to study the effects of radioactivity on various substances and biological organisms. The Soviet Union will also give Czechoslovakia a large cyclotron accelerator of up to 25 million electron volts, which can be used to study changes in atomic nuclei.
    Soviet Ural Machinery Factory, etc. Streamline Management Institutions
    Some factories in the Ural region of the Soviet Union are streamlining their management institutions to strengthen production departments and save a lot of funds for the country.
    In Sverdlovsk, Ural, the Ural Machinery Factory merged many departments while reducing its management institutions. For example, the sales section was merged with the finance section, the fuel section was merged with the supply section, and the planning and economic committee in each workshop was merged with the planning and distribution committee. At the same time, the technical committee was also unified with the labor and wage committee. In order to reduce administrative management costs and more rationally utilize production sites and equipment, the factory also merged six workshops. It is now preparing to merge four more workshops. As a result of these improvements, the factory has transferred 342 people from non-production departments to direct production departments.
    The Ural Electrical Equipment Factory is also streamlining its management institutions. The factory's management department has reduced 86 people.
    Vietnam Achieves Many Achievements in Restoring Industry and Commerce
    Since the restoration of peace until the end of June this year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved many achievements in restoring industry and commerce.
    State-owned trade institutions have guaranteed the supply of daily necessities to the newly liberated cities, and the prices of rice, salt, firewood, cloth, cotton yarn, and kerosene are stable. Handicraft and small industries that produce daily necessities have been quickly restored and developed with the support of the government.
    The state-owned factories and mines that produce phosphate, matches, paper, tin, and coal, although many machines and tools were moved away by the French, production has been restored under the efforts of the workers, and output has even increased.
    At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also starting to restore some factories left by the French, such as the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the Hanoi Ice Factory, and other enterprises in Haiphong.
    Private commerce that used to serve the colonialists and the war has also begun to change its direction of operation. Many businessmen have begun to operate forest products and agricultural products, or invest their funds in the business of necessities such as sugar, linen, shoes, and paper.
    Normal material exchanges have been re-established between cities and villages and between provinces. The reconstruction of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway and other roads has created favorable conditions for the development of industry and commerce, especially the trade in forest products such as bamboo and wood. Due to the development of forest products, farmers in some provinces near the Vietnam-China border have received additional benefits equivalent to 25 to 30 percent of their annual income. State-owned trade institutions have played a great role in the purchase and sale of forest products.
    Foreign trade has also developed. This year, the quantity of goods exchanged between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China and other brotherly countries is equal to four to seven times that of last year.
    Many Factories in Romania Complete Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Romanian workers have achieved remarkable achievements in the socialist competition to complete the first five-year plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule. As of the end of June, more than 150 enterprises in Bucharest, Stalin Oblast, and Hungarian Autonomous Oblast have successfully completed the five-year plan and have already begun producing products for 1956.
    The workers of the electrical equipment factory and the chemical factory have achieved the most outstanding results in the socialist competition. They have completed the tasks stipulated in the five-year plan almost eight months ahead of schedule. Many light industry and food industry enterprises have also completed all the tasks of their five-year plan more than half a year ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联科学院讨论和平利用原子能会议继续开会
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：苏联科学院讨论和平利用原子能的科学和技术问题的会议，二日在莫斯科继续举行。这一天，苏联科学院的物理数学部、技术科学部、化学部、生物学部四个部举行了会议。苏联科学专家在会上报告了将放射线用于改进技术操作过程、用于生理学和医学等方面的情况。
    物理数学部举行的会议讨论了有关利用原子能的新技术部门的基本原则的一些物理学问题。会上，苏联物理数学博士科津湼茨和苏联科学通讯院士弗兰克，就在含有铀和缓速剂（石墨、重水）的各种体系中进行的核子链锁反应的发展情况的问题，报告了研究结果。其他几个学术报告指出了在计算核子反应时需要的几个物理常数的测定办法。
    在技术科学部的会议上，到会的科学家们讨论了在研究冶金技术过程中使用放射性指示剂方法的总结。苏联科学院通讯院士萨马林和工程师卡林尼科夫的联合报告指出，根据“电钢工厂”采用示踪原子法来研究砌在盛钢桶和出钢槽内的各种耐火材料的结果，探明最好的耐火材料是高矾土砖（具有最大的稳定性），它对减低钢中的非金属杂质有很大帮助。会议还听取了用放射线照像法研究金属中杂质的报告。
    化学部举行的会议讨论了有关辐射化学的问题。化学候补博士卡尔波夫在他的报告中讲述了辐射对于高分子化合物所起的作用。化学博士巴赫教授讲述了在辐射对无机盐溶液所起的作用的研究结果。会议还听取了关于氧化还原和最简单的辐射化学反应的动力学的报告。
    在生物学部会议上所作的各个报告介绍了在对动植物机体实行的离子辐射作用的新研究。
    苏联科学院讨论和平利用原子能的会议仍在继续进行。
    苏联在工业生产中应用原子能的新成就
    苏联最近在工业生产中应用原子能方面又取得了新的成就。
    在钢铁工业中，车里雅宾斯克钢铁工厂已经使用“示踪”原子来研究高级钢的熔炼过程，从而弄清了钢水渗入杂质的原因，解决了其他一些生产上的问题，提高了炼出的钢的质量。这个工厂还正在利用放射性同位素来研究平炉炉料的熔化时间的问题。根据初步研究的结果证明，使用放射性同位素可以把炼钢时间大大缩短，并且把平炉的生产效率大大提高。
    在采油工业中，鞑靼石油托辣斯的地质工作人员和钻探人员，已经开始把放射性同位素应用在石油钻探工作中。他们用一种专门的仪器来记录出含在矿层中的放射性同位素的分裂强度，然后根据仪器中照相底片上的曲线来探明石油的矿藏。鞑靼的各采油场最近在生产中还把放射性同位素的液体注入石油矿层，然后根据它在矿层中的流动路线来了解矿井当前的状况。
    苏联将交给捷克斯洛伐克一原子反应堆
    捷克斯洛伐克科学院物理研究所所长切·亚马尼在六月三十日说：苏联将交给捷克斯洛伐克一个二千瓩的原子反应堆，这种原子反应堆可以用来进行原子核物理学和中子物理学方面的任何种类的研究，可以用来进行动力反应堆的研究，可以用来生产放射性同位素，也可以用来研究放射性对各种物质和生物有机体的影响。苏联还将交给捷克斯洛伐克高达二十五个百万电子伏特的大型回旋加速器，有了这种加速器就能对原子核的变化进行研究。
    苏联乌拉尔机器工厂等精简管理机构
    苏联乌拉尔一些工厂正精简管理机构，以增强生产部门，并为国家节约大量资金。
    在乌拉尔的斯维德洛夫斯克，乌拉尔机器工厂在缩减管理机构时合并了许多部门。例如，销售科同财务科合并，燃料科同供应科合并，各个车间里的计划经济委员会同计划分配委员会合并，同时技术委员会也同劳动工资委员会统一了起来。为了减少行政管理费用和更合理地利用生产场所和设备，工厂还合并了六个车间。现在正在准备再合并四个车间。由于这些改进，工厂已经从非生产部门转移了三百四十二人到直接生产部门中去。
    乌拉尔电气设备工厂也正在进行精简管理机构的工作。工厂的管理部门已经缩减了八十六人。
    越南在恢复工商业方面取得许多成就
    自从和平恢复以来到今年六月底止，越南民主共和国在恢复工商业方面取得了许多成就。
    国营贸易机构保证了对新解放城市的日用必需品的供应，大米、盐、柴、布匹、棉纱和煤油的价格是稳定的。生产日用必需品的手工业和小工业在政府的扶植下，很快得到恢复和发展。
    生产磷酸盐、火柴、纸张、锡、煤的国营厂矿，虽然被法方搬走了不少机器和工具，但是在工人们的努力下生产已经恢复，产量甚至还有提高。
    同时，越南民主共和国政府还正在着手恢复法方遗留下来的一些工厂，如南定纺织厂、河内制冰厂和海防的其他企业。
    从前为殖民者和战争服务的私营商业也开始转变了经营的方向。许多商人开始经营林产品和农产品，或者把他们的资金投到经营食糖、亚麻布、鞋类、纸张等必需品的商业方面来。
    城市和乡村以及各省之间已重新建立起正常的物资交流。河内—睦南关铁路和其他道路的重建已经为工商业特别是竹子木材等林产品的贸易发展创造了有利条件。由于林产品的开发靠近越南—中国边界的一些省份的农民已得到相当于他们每年收入的百分之二十五到三十的额外利益。国营贸易机构在收购和销售林产品方面起了极大的作用。
    对外贸易也已向前发展了。今年越南民主共和国同中国以及其他兄弟国家互换的货物数量等于去年的四倍到七倍。
    罗马尼亚许多工厂提前完成五年计划
    罗马尼亚工人在争取提前完成第一个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的社会主义竞赛中取得了显著的成就。截至六月底止，布加勒斯特、斯大林州、匈牙利民族自治州共有一百五十多个企业胜利地完成了五年计划，并且已经开始生产一九五六年的产品。
    在社会主义竞赛中成绩最突出的是电气设备工厂和化学工厂的工人们，他们差不多提前八个月完成了五年计划规定的任务。许多轻工业和食品工业企业也提前半年以上完成了它们的五年计划的全部任务。（据新华社讯）
