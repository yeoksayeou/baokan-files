    Strive to Fully Realize the First Five-Year Plan
    Increase Production and Practice Economy to Guarantee Quality, Determined to Refine More and Better Steel for the Motherland
    Editor:
    After reading Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," we were greatly encouraged. At the same time, we also deeply feel the importance of our responsibility. Because we know that the work of each of us is a part of the Five-Year Construction Plan. Therefore, we are determined to study hard, work actively, and ensure quality, increase production, and practice strict economy.
    In the past, the iron smelting department of our factory had some chaotic phenomena in the work of receiving materials: the calculation was not careful when using materials, and the materials received were not used up and accumulated. Now the iron smelting department has implemented a quota system for receiving materials, and we must ensure that materials are received according to the plan in the future. We must also guarantee that the quality of the iron we refine reaches 100%.
    The casting department of our factory is currently learning from advanced Soviet experience and improving the melting furnace. After this improvement is successful, it will be able to increase the production of 1.5 tons of iron per hour for the country. We also need to improve the chemical composition and increase the temperature of molten iron, so as to use scrap iron instead of good iron to reduce costs. In addition, the iron pipes we cast now are sometimes uneven in thickness, and we must improve the quality of iron pipes in the future.
    The key issue in the current production of the power department's steam locomotive workshop, etc., in our factory is to eliminate accidents and ensure safe operation. Recently, we have formulated three systems for eliminating accidents, that is, ensuring that no major or minor accidents occur, doing a good job in anti-accident drills and technical question and answer work. In this way, we can find problems at any time and carry out repairs at any time, and even if an accident occurs, we will not be flustered and affect production.
    In the past, the coal washing workshop of our factory often caused large fluctuations in the ash content of clean coal due to changes in coal types and poor control of operations. If the ash content is high, it will affect the quality of coke and fail to complete the iron smelting task. In the future, we must further learn from advanced Soviet experience, earnestly implement expert suggestions, and summarize the coal washing operation methods used in the past for various coal types to ensure the quality of coke. In addition, we must also do a good job in recovering coal powder and improving automatic slag discharge.
    The several departments we work in have all completed and overfulfilled the state plan from January to June this year. We must overcome all difficulties, unite with all employees in the factory, learn from each other, and refine more and better steel to supply the needs of the country's socialist construction.

    Strive to Complete Daily, Monthly and Annual Plans, and Do a Good Job in Railway Transportation
    Editor:
    I was very excited after reading Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy"! Things that were unthinkable and impossible in the old China are now listed on the construction schedule one by one.
    Recalling the old China, our country only had a handful of broken cars crawling on paralyzed lines. After liberation, many new railway lines were built in a few years. In the first five-year plan, several new lines will be built, and the volume of freight on the original lines will also increase by more than one time. This task is significant and arduous. However, the working class of the new China will not be afraid of difficulties. Our railway workers will do everything possible to fight for the smooth realization of the first five-year plan.
    We deeply understand the great significance of railway transportation to national construction. Therefore, we must respond to the call of the Party and the government with practical actions and strive to increase production and practice economy and overfulfill the state task. Yang Zhiwen's locomotive crew team 6490 has safely traveled 667,000 kilometers. We will strive to reach 900,000 kilometers in 1957. This year's washing and repairing kilometer target is 6,000 kilometers. Now we strive to increase it to 10,000 kilometers. In addition, we will also strive to extend a Class A inspection period and save 42 tons of coal throughout the year. We are also learning fitter skills and strive to reach the level of 4th and 5th grade fitter this year. In this way, we have the ability to self-inspect and self-repair, and can eliminate accidents such as locomotive damage at any time, saving the country repair costs. Tian Shuyan's locomotive crew team 2131 has initially achieved success in the trial of emulsified cylinder oil. If this method is promoted in all freight trains in the locomotive section, it can save the country 6,000 yuan in the second half of the year. In addition, the general use of Kouquan coal mixed with coke breeze on locomotives also saves the country a lot of fuel costs. The locomotive of Zhuang Entao's locomotive crew team 2124 was originally scheduled to enter the factory for medium repair in July. Due to good maintenance, it is estimated that it can be extended to August for a Class A inspection, which can save the country 24,400 yuan.
    In short, as long as we find ways to save expenses, we can accumulate more funds for the country. The power of our individuals is small, but as long as every worker realizes the responsibility he bears for the realization of the first five-year plan, and completes and strives to overfulfill the production targets and work tasks every day, every month, and every year, then the completion of the five-year plan will be guaranteed. We believe that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and through the unremitting efforts of all the people, the first five-year plan can be fully realized! The great cause of socialist construction in our country will surely be victorious!

    Strive to Lead Agricultural Production Cooperatives, Explore Potential, and Ensure Completion of Production Increase Tasks
    Editor:
    After studying Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," we understand more clearly what our country will be built into in another two and a half years. By then, the country will increase the production of more steel, iron, and various machines; build more textile factories and sugar factories. What makes us especially happy is that by then our farmers will be able to use cars made in our country and get more chemical fertilizers. By 1959, tractors made in our country will also serve us. We must strive to lead our own agricultural production cooperatives and fight to complete the agricultural production increase tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan!
    Our agricultural production cooperative has gradually improved labor organization and production management and promoted advanced science and technology since it was established in the autumn of 1952. Although it suffered a serious flood in 1954, the production volume increased by 28.38% compared with 1952. This year we have prepared to pre-deliver public grain and surplus grain sold to the country, totaling more than 95,000 jin of wheat. Most of the land in our cooperative is planted with high-yield crops, such as potatoes, corn, and vegetables needed by industrial and mining areas and urban residents. We use excellent varieties and advanced planting methods to give full play to the land's fertility, and crops can be harvested three times a year. On average, each mu of land can harvest 3,000 jin of potatoes, 400 jin of corn, and 4,932 jin of vegetables per year.
    Our cooperative still has great potential for increasing production that has not been exploited. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report pointed out a clear direction for our efforts. Our cooperative still has more than 700 mu of sandy wasteland to be reclaimed, and more than 300 mu of barren sandy land. We are planning to gradually turn them into fertile fields and vegetable gardens. In the past, we were scattered production by households. Therefore, the original agricultural infrastructure is no longer suitable for the current production scale. For example, waterwheels and wells are sometimes too concentrated and cannot give full play to irrigation efficiency, and some occupy arable land. We are carrying out unified planning to make appropriate adjustments to increase the irrigation area, reduce unnecessary investment, and gradually develop efficient and low-cost pumping wells. Our cooperative's original thousand-plus small windbreaks of several zhang in length now hinder the land from forming large tracts and the growth of crops. We will replant two to three windbreaks of about eight li in length. We will develop livestock in coordination with the development of agricultural production, and use vegetable leaves, corn stalks, etc. to raise pigs. This year we have planted eight mu of grapes and some apples, and plan to gradually develop orchards and plant medicinal materials in the future.
    In order to realize the first five-year plan, in order to make agriculture keep up with the development of industry, we will do our best to lead the Baipenyao Agricultural Production Cooperative well.

    Future Engineers are Prepared to Devote All Their Strength to Their Work
    Editor:
    We are graduating students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology. Just as we were nervously conducting the thesis defense of our graduation design, we read Comrade Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy." This report encouraged us to go to the posts where the motherland needs us with full confidence and enthusiasm. Because we see more clearly and more specifically how great and magnificent our cause is, and how glorious the responsibility that each of us bears in this cause is!
    The first five-year plan is like a great construction plan unfolding before our eyes. In the twenty-six years from 1907 to 1933 in the old China, the production of steel only increased by more than 10,000 tons. At that time, even a pitiful steel plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel could not be established. And in the first five-year plan, we will increase the annual output of steel by more than 2 million tons, and steel products will be able to meet the needs of manufacturing locomotives, automobiles, ships, and tractors. Only the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao can formulate such a plan and carry out such construction.
    We understand that this great plan and each of us are closely related like flesh and blood. Look! The five-year plan says: steel bases such as Anshan, Wuhan, and Baotou should be built; our classmates' work application forms say: "I am willing to go to the site - Angang, Wugang, Baogang". The five-year plan says: we must develop scientific research and vigorously train cadres; students write on their application forms: "I am willing to go to the Academy of Sciences," "I am willing to go to the factory laboratory," "I am willing to go to the school." The wish of each of us is to dedicate our strength to the realization of the five-year plan. On the eve of taking up new positions, we guarantee to unconditionally obey the motherland's dispatch and work actively and diligently wherever we go. Use practical actions to confirm our promise. When the first five-year plan is completed, each of us will be able to say without shame: "I have contributed all my strength to the first five-year plan!"

    为全部实现第一个五年计划而奋斗
    增产节约保证质量，决心为祖国炼出更多更好的钢铁编辑同志：
    看了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”以后，我们受到了很大的鼓舞。同时，我们也深深地感到自己责任的重大。因为我们知道，我们每个人的工作都是五年建设计划的一部分。因此，我们决心好好学习，积极劳动，做到保证质量，增加生产，厉行节约。
    过去我们厂的炼铁部在领料工作中有着一些混乱现象：用材料时计算不周密，领来的材料用不完就积压起来。现在炼铁部已经实行了限额领料制度，今后一定要保证按计划领料。我们还要保证炼出来的铁质量达到百分之百。
    我们厂的铸造部目前正在学习苏联先进经验，改进熔铁炉。这项改进成功后，每小时能为国家增产一吨半铁。我们还要搞好化学成分，提高铁水温度，以便利用废铁代替好铁，来降低成本。此外，现在我们铸造出来的铁管有的地方厚薄还不够均匀，今后一定要提高铁管质量。
    我们厂的动力部蒸汽车间等，目前生产中的关键问题是消灭事故，保证安全运转。最近我们订出了三项消灭事故的制度，即保证不出大小事故，做好反事故演习和技术问答工作。这样，就能够做到随时发现毛病随时进行检修，即使发生事故也不会手忙脚乱影响生产了。
    我们厂的洗煤车间过去常因煤种变化，操作掌握不好，使净煤灰分波动很大。灰分大了，就会影响焦炭质量，完不成炼铁任务。今后我们要进一步学习苏联先进经验，认真执行专家建议，总结一下过去所用各煤种的洗煤操作方法，以保证焦炭质量。此外，还要做好收回煤粉工作和改进自动放渣工作。
    我们工作的几个部门，今年一月到六月都完成和超额完成了国家计划。我们要克服一切困难，同全厂职工一致团结，互相学习，炼出更多更好的钢铁，来供给国家社会主义建设事业的需要。

    争取完成每天每月每年的计划，做好铁路运输工作编辑同志：
    读了国务院副总理李富春的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，十分兴奋！在旧中国想不到和做不到的事，现在都一一列在建设日程上了。
    回想起旧中国的时候，我国只有屈指可数的几辆破车在支离瘫痪的线路上爬行。解放以后，几年里就修建了不少铁路新线。在第一个五年计划中，还要修建几条新线，原有线路上的货物运转量也将增长一倍以上。这个任务是重大和艰巨的。但是，新中国的工人阶级不会惧怕困难。我们铁路工人将尽一切努力，为保证第一个五年计划的顺利实现而奋斗。
    我们深深体会到铁路运输对国家建设的重大意义，因此，我们一定要用实际行动来响应党和政府的号召，为增产节约和超额完成国家任务而努力。杨志文所在的攵T六四九○包乘组已经安全走行了六十六万七千公里，我们要争取在一九五七年达到九十万公里；今年洗修公里的指标是六千公里，现在我们争取再提高到一万公里；另外还争取延长一个甲检期，全年省煤四十二吨。我们还在学习钳工手艺，争取今年达到四、五级钳工的水平。这样，我们就有自检自修的能力，可以随时消灭机车破损等事故，为国家节省修理费用。田枢严所在的冖冖ㄎ二一三一的包乘组，试验乳化汽缸油已初步获得成功，如果全机务段的货物列车都推行这个办法，下半年就可以为国家节约六千元。此外，机车上普遍使用了口泉煤掺焦末，也为国家节省大量的燃料费。庄恩涛所在的冖ㄎ二一二四包乘组的机车，按原计划在七月份需入厂中修，由于保养得好，估计可以延长到八月份作甲检，这就可为国家节约二万四千四百元。
    总之，只要我们想办法，节省开支，就可以多为国家积累资金。我们个人的力量是微小的，但只要我们每一个工人都认识到自己对实现第一个五年计划所担负的责任，每天、每月、每年都完成和争取超额完成生产指标和工作任务，那末，五年计划的完成就有了保证。我们相信，在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，经过全体人民的不倦努力，第一个五年计划是可以全部实现的！我国的社会主义建设的伟大事业是一定要胜利的！

    努力领导农业生产合作社，发掘潜力，保证完成增产任务编辑同志：
    我们学习了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”后，更清楚地懂得再过两年半以后，我们国家将会建设成什么样子。到那时，国家将增产更多的钢、铁和各种机器；建设起更多的纺织厂和制糖厂。特别叫我们高兴的是，到那时我们农民将能使用我国自制的汽车，得到更多的化学肥料。到一九五九年，我国自制的拖拉机也要为我们服务了。我们一定要努力领导自己的农业生产合作社，为完成第一个五年计划中所规定的农业增产任务而奋斗！
    我们这个农业生产合作社自从一九五二年秋天成立以来，逐步改进了劳动组织和生产管理，推广了先进科学技术，虽然一九五四年遭受严重的涝灾，但是生产量比一九五二年还提高了百分之二十八点三八。今年我们已准备好预交公粮和卖给国家的余粮共达小麦九万五千多斤。我们社大部分土地种的是高产作物，如马铃薯、玉米和供给工矿区、城市居民所需的蔬菜。我们采用优良品种和先进种植方法，充分发挥地力，每年的作物可以收获三次。平均每年每亩地可收马铃薯三千斤，玉米四百斤，蔬菜四千九百三十二斤。
    我们社仍然有着很大的增产潜力没有发挥。李富春副总理的报告给我们指出了明确的努力方向。我们社还有七百多亩沙坡荒地有待开垦，还有三百多亩瘠薄沙地，我们正计划逐步把它们变为良田和菜园。过去我们是一家一户分散生产，因此，原来的农业基本建设已经不适应于现在的生产规模。例如水车和水井有的过于集中，不能充分发挥灌溉效能，有的占用了耕地面积。我们正在进行统一的规划，加以适当调整，以增加灌溉面积，减少不必要的投资，并将逐步发展效率高成本低的抽水机井。我们社原来的千多条几丈长的小防风林，现在已经妨碍土地的连成大片和庄稼的生长，我们将重新改植两条到三条约八里长的防风林带。我们将要配合农业生产的发展而发展家畜，利用菜叶、玉米秆秸等饲养毛猪。今年我们已种植了八亩葡萄和一些苹果，今后计划逐步发展果园和种植药材。
    为了实现第一个五年计划，为了使农业跟上工业的发展，我们将竭尽心力地把白盆窑农业生产合作社领导好。

    未来的工程师们准备在工作岗位上献出自己的全部力量编辑同志：
    我们是北京钢铁工业学院应届毕业生。正当我们紧张地进行着毕业设计论文答辩的时候，我们读到了李富春同志“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。这个报告鼓舞我们信心百倍、热情充沛地走上祖国需要我们的岗位上去。因为我们更加清楚、更加具体地看到我们的事业是多么伟大壮丽，而我们每一个人在这个事业中所负的责任又是多么光荣！
    第一个五年计划好像一幅伟大的施工图展开在我们的眼前。旧中国在一九○七年到一九三三年的二十六个年头中钢的产量才增加了一万多吨，那时连一个小得可怜的年产十万吨钢的钢铁厂也建立不起来。而我们在第一个五年计划里，就要使钢的年产量增加二百多万吨，钢铁的产品将能满足制造机车、汽车、轮船、拖拉机的需要。只有中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民才能拟订这样的计划，才能进行这样的建设。
    我们了解这个伟大的计划和我们每一个人都有着血肉般的密切联系。请看！五年计划上写着：要建设鞍山、武汉、包头等钢铁基地；我们同学的工作志愿书上写着：“我愿意到现场——鞍钢、武钢、包钢”。五年计划上写着：要发展科学研究事业，要大力培养干部；同学们在志愿书上写着：“我愿意到科学院”，“我愿意到工厂研究室”，“我愿意到学校”。我们每个人的志愿，也就是为实现五年计划而献出自己的力量。在走上新的岗位的前夕，我们保证无条件地服从祖国调遣，到那里都积极努力地工作。用实际行动来证实我们自己的诺言。当第一个五年计划完成的时候，我们每个人都将无愧地说：“我曾经为第一个五年计划贡献出我的全部力量！”
