    From the many materials that have already been revealed, it can be seen that the Hu Feng clique members resolutely opposed and were extremely afraid of rectification. In addition to slandering ideological remolding as one of the five "knives" placed on the heads of writers, and as "military rule" or "warlord rule," they also took various measures to resist rectification. One method was to escape. For example, when the Tianjin literary and art circles began rectification in 1952, A Long hid in Hunan; when Lü Ying launched an ideological remolding movement at Shandong University, he also fled from Shandong to Shanghai, saying that this "could avoid some unnecessary entanglements." If escape was not possible, they shifted the target, or, as Hu Feng instructed Lü Yuan, "in rectification, the main thing is to talk about leadership"; or, like Lu Li, they created personnel disputes in the rectification to achieve the purpose of "fishing in troubled waters." If they could neither escape nor shift the target, they had to perfunctorily deal with it and try to "slip through," as Lu Dian did during the rectification of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

    Of course, those who opposed and feared rectification were by no means limited to the Hu Feng clique members; all counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks were like this. It is not at all surprising that counter-revolutionaries oppose and fear rectification. Because rectification is an important and time-tested method used by our Party to carry out inner-Party struggle and ideological remolding. Our Party uses this method to effectively overcome the contradictions between working-class ideology and non-working-class ideology within the Party, so that the Party can achieve unity and consolidation on the basis of ideological consistency in Marxism-Leninism. Our Party also uses this method to carry out self-education and self-reform movements among the broad masses of non-Party workers and revolutionary intellectuals, so that they can break away from the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries and transform their bad habits and bad ideas acquired from the old society. We want to use the method of rectification to maintain the ideological purity of the working class vanguard within the Party and to expand the陣地 (zhèn dì) of working-class ideology outside the Party. This is completely contrary to the interests of the counter-revolutionaries, and naturally extremely disliked by the counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, through rectification, everyone's theoretical level and ideological awareness of Marxism-Leninism are improved, their work style is transformed, and their ability to identify and resist hostile ideas is enhanced, which makes it easier to isolate and eventually expose the hidden counter-revolutionaries. The true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was gradually exposed in several rectifications before and after liberation. Isn't it perfectly natural that the Hu Feng clique members and other hidden counter-revolutionaries frantically slander ideological remolding and try every possible means to resist rectification?

    Since rectification plays a significant role in purifying and consolidating the revolutionary ranks, those of us who stand on the revolutionary position should obviously welcome and actively participate in rectification. However, among our revolutionary ranks, even among Communist Party members, there are some who have made ideological and political mistakes and have adopted incorrect attitudes towards rectification and ideological remolding.

    Some people say that "everyone has individualism," and that "there is nothing wrong with a little liberalism," expressing tolerance for the influence of bourgeois ideas such as individualism, liberalism, and arrogance. When these erroneous arguments are criticized, some people even use the excuse of "existence determines consciousness," believing that since there is still a vast ocean of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie around us, the influence of bourgeois ideology cannot be overcome. These comrades only see one aspect of the matter and do not see the other aspect. It is true that we are still in a class society, and the acute and complex class struggle is unfolding on all fronts, including the ideological front. Bourgeois ideology is eroding and influencing us at all times. But it should also be seen that our country is led by the working class, and the socialist economic component already occupies a dominant position in our economic life and is constantly expanding this advantage. This "existence" also determines that the ideology of the working class will inevitably occupy a dominant position in the ideological field, and will constantly expand this advantage in the struggle to overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, it can only be said that the influence of bourgeois ideology on the revolutionary ranks is unavoidable, but it is not "impossible to overcome," but it is certainly possible to overcome. We must transform ourselves in the process of transforming society, and we must also promote the transformation of society through the transformation of people's thinking.

    Some people have a sense of weariness towards rectification and ideological remolding. They are like those "varnished" Communists that Stalin talked about: "They often grumble and wave away self-criticism: Hey, this damn self-criticism again, exposing our shortcomings again - can't you let me live in peace?" These comrades do not understand that we need to constantly rectify our thinking and work style, just as we need to constantly wash our faces and clean our rooms. Only by constantly rectifying our thinking and work style can we achieve "flowing water does not become stagnant, and a door hinge does not become worm-eaten," resisting the erosion of various political dust and political microorganisms. Some literary and art workers who participated in the literary and art rectification in Yan'an, after entering big cities, were surrounded by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, and doubts and wavering occurred again in the implementation of the Party's literary and art policy. Only after the literary and art rectification of 1951-1952 did they return to the literary and art direction determined by the Party. This fact also illustrates the necessity of carrying out rectification frequently.

    There are also some people who are afraid of the pain in the process of ideological struggle and take a "passing the test" attitude towards rectification. They do not deeply hate and relentlessly attack their own bad ideas and bad habits, nor do they warmly welcome criticism from others, but are afraid of being sharp. Yes, the new must overcome the old, and new ideas must overcome old ideas, which requires a fierce struggle. This fierce ideological struggle will be painful when we are not fully conscious. But "no destruction, no construction," since we are determined to establish new ideas, we must launch a resolute struggle against old ideas, and therefore we must bravely overcome the pain that may arise in the process of ideological struggle. For Communists, the question is even clearer, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us:
  "The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people as their point of departure, believe that their cause is entirely just and are willing to sacrifice everything personal of theirs, and are ready at all times to lay down their lives for our cause. Then what ideas, views, opinions, or methods are there which are unsuited to the needs of the people and which they are reluctant to discard?"

    In the revolutionary ranks, those who have made ideological and political mistakes and therefore adopt an incorrect attitude towards rectification and ideological remolding are not all bad people. Generally speaking, they are all good people. But in the matter of rejecting rectification and fearing rectification, they have something in common with the counter-revolutionaries hidden in the revolutionary ranks. This cannot but arouse our serious vigilance. It should be known that in the rectification movement, our Party's policy towards those who have made certain mistakes in ideology and politics but are willing to correct their mistakes is "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient." Rectification is to bathe them, to treat their illnesses, so that they can maintain political and ideological cleanliness and health, which is beneficial and harmless to them. Rectification is only detrimental to the counter-revolutionaries hidden in the revolutionary ranks; it is precisely through rectification that we want to isolate and expose them, strip them of their disguise, and dig out their counter-revolutionary roots. If our people also reject rectification and fear rectification, it will not only allow counter-revolutionaries to "pass off fish eyes as pearls" in the revolutionary ranks, giving counter-revolutionaries a great convenience, but also because we retain various "gaps" such as individualism, liberalism, and subjectivism, which will facilitate the attack of counter-revolutionaries. Don't the Hu Feng elements find those with ideological problems and political errors as if they had found a treasure, and want to "try them out"? This also educates every member of our revolutionary ranks to actively participate in rectification, constantly carry out ideological remolding, and constantly overcome their own shortcomings and errors, so as not to give counter-revolutionaries any opportunity to take advantage of.

    "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support; whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." This is a "political principle" that Comrade Mao Zedong wants us to "never forget." On the issue of rectification, we should also apply this principle. Since the enemy desperately opposes and resists rectification, we must adhere to rectification, adhere to the frequent use of rectification methods to purify and consolidate our revolutionary ranks, improve our combat effectiveness, and not let any hidden counter-revolutionaries "slip through"!

### 我们的人不应当害怕整风

    我们的人不应当害怕整风
    钟怀
    从已经揭露的许多材料可以看出，胡风集团分子是坚决反对和十分害怕整风的。他们除了诬蔑思想改造是放在作家头上的五把“刀子”中的一把，是“军事统治”或“军阀统治”外，还采取种种办法来抗拒整风。办法之一是逃避。例如一九五二年天津文艺界开始整风时，阿垅就躲在湖南；吕荧在山东大学开展思想改造运动时，也从山东逃到上海，用他们的话说，这样“即可避免一些无谓的纠缠”。逃避不成，就转移目标，或者如胡风指示绿原那样，“在整风中，主要的一条是谈领导”；或者如鲁藜那样，在整风中制造人事纠纷，好达到“混水摸鱼”的目的。既不能逃避，又无法转移目标，那就只好敷衍应付，想办法“滑过去”，像芦甸在华北文联整风时所做的那样。
    当然，反对和害怕整风的绝不止是胡风集团分子；一切暗藏在革命队伍里的反革命分子都是这样。反革命分子所以反对和害怕整风是一点也不奇怪的。因为整风是我们党用来进行党内斗争和思想改造的一种久经考验的重要方法。我们党采用这种方法有效地克服着党内工人阶级思想和非工人阶级思想的矛盾，使党能够在马克思列宁主义思想一致的基础上达到统一和巩固。我们党也采用这种方法在广大非党工作人员和革命知识分子中开展自我教育和自我改造的运动，使得他们脱离内外反动派的影响，改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想。我们要用整风的方法在党内保持工人阶级先锋队的思想上的纯洁，在党外扩大工人阶级思想的阵地，这同反革命分子的利益完全相反，自然是反革命分子所极不喜欢的。同时经过整风，大家提高了马克思列宁主义的理论水平和思想觉悟，转变了作风，增强了识别和抵制敌对思想的能力，也就容易使暗藏的反革命分子孤立起来终至于暴露出来。胡风反革命集团的面目正是在解放前和解放后的几次整风中逐步暴露出来的。胡风集团分子和别的暗藏的反革命分子所以疯狂地诬蔑思想改造和千方百计地抗拒整风，岂不是十分自然的事么？
    既然整风对于纯洁和巩固革命队伍有重大的作用，站在革命立场的我们的人显然应当欢迎整风和积极地参加整风。可是在我们革命队伍甚至共产党员中间，也有一部分犯有思想上和政治上错误的人，对整风和思想改造采取了不正确的态度。
    有些人说什么“个人主义，人皆有之”，“有一点自由主义没有什么”，对个人主义、自由主义、骄傲情绪等资产阶级的思想影响表示容忍。当这种错误的论调受到批判时，有人甚至借口“存在决定意识”，认为既然在我们周围还存在着资产阶级和小资产阶级的汪洋大海，那末资产阶级的思想影响也就无法克服。这些同志只看到了事情的一方面，而没有看到另一方面。不错，我们现在还处在有阶级的社会，尖锐复杂的阶级斗争在各个战线也在思想战线上展开着，资产阶级思想无时无刻不在侵蚀和影响我们。但是也要看到我们的国家是工人阶级领导的，社会主义经济成份已经在我们的经济生活中占居优势而且不断扩大着这种优势，这种“存在”也就决定了工人阶级的思想必然会在思想领域内占居优势，而且在不断克服资产阶级思想影响的斗争中，不断扩大这种优势。因而只能说资产阶级的思想对革命队伍的影响是不可免的，但是并不是“无法克服”的，而是一定能够克服的。我们正是要在改造社会的过程中改造我们自己，也要通过对人们的思想的改造来推动对社会的改造。
    有些人对整风和思想改造有一种厌倦的情绪。他们就像斯大林谈到那些“涂了漆的”共产党员时所说的一样：“他们时常咕噜着，挥开自我批评：嘿，又是这该死的自我批评，又是揭露我们的缺点——可不可以让我安静地活下去呢？”这些同志不了解我们需要经常地整顿思想作风，就如同需要经常地洗脸和打扫房间一样。只有经常地整顿思想作风，才能做到“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”，抵抗各种政治灰尘和政治微生物对我们的侵蚀。一部分曾经在延安参加过文艺整风的文艺工作者，在进入大城市以后，在资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的包围之下，对贯彻党的文艺方针又发生了怀疑和动摇，经过一九五一—一九五二年的再一次文艺整风后，才回到党所确定的文艺方向上来，这个事实也说明了经常地进行整风的必要性。
    也有一些人害怕思想斗争过程中的痛苦，对整风抱着过“关”态度。他们对待自己身上的坏思想坏作风不是深恶痛绝，穷追猛打，对待别人对自己的批评也不是热烈欢迎，而是唯恐尖锐。是的，新事物要战胜旧事物，新思想要战胜旧思想，是要经过激烈的斗争的。这种激烈的思想斗争在我们还没有充分自觉的情况下是会有痛苦的。但是“不破不立”，我们既然决心要树立新思想，就必须对旧思想展开坚决的斗争，因而也就必须勇敢地克服思想斗争过程中可能产生的痛苦。对于共产党员来说，问题更加明白，这就是毛泽东同志所教导我们的：
  “以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”
    在革命队伍中，犯有思想上和政治上的错误因而对待整风和思想改造采取了不正确态度的人，并不都是坏人，一般说来他们都是好人。但是他们在拒绝整风、害怕整风这个问题上却同暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子有了共同之点。这就不能不引起我们的严重警惕。要知道在整风运动中，对那些在思想上和政治上犯有某些错误但是愿意改正错误的人，我们党的方针是“惩前毖后，治病救人”。整风就是替他们洗澡，为他们治病，使他们能够保持政治上、思想上的清洁和健康，因而对于他们是有百利而无一弊的。整风只是对于暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子不利；我们也正是要经过整风来孤立和暴露他们，剥去他们的伪装，挖出他们的反革命根子。如果我们的人也拒绝整风和害怕整风，那就不只是可以使反革命分子在革命队伍中“鱼目混珠”，给了反革命分子很大的方便，而且也会因为我们身上保留着个人主义、自由主义、主观主义等各种各样的“缺口”，便于反革命分子的进攻。胡风分子发现有思想毛病和政治错误的人，不是如获至宝，要去“一试”么？这也就教育我们革命队伍的每个成员要积极地参加整风，经常地进行思想改造，不断克服自身的缺点和错误，不使反革命分子有任何可乘之隙。
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”这是毛泽东同志要我们“千万不可忘记”的一条“政治原则”。在对待整风的问题上，我们同样应当运用这条原则。既然敌人拚命反对和抗拒整风，我们就一定要坚持整风，坚持经常运用整风的方法来纯洁和巩固我们的革命队伍，提高我们的战斗力，并且不让任何暗藏的反革命分子“滑过去”！
