    Restoring Mutual Trust and Cooperation Among Major Powers is a Fundamental Factor in Maintaining World Peace
    Wang Tieya

    The Four-Power Heads of Government Conference begins today in Geneva. This is the first time in ten years since the end of World War II that the heads of government of the major powers have met. At a time when people all over the world are strongly demanding the easing of international tensions and the strengthening of world peace, the convening of this conference is of great significance. People have reason to demand that the heads of government of the four major powers, through this conference, establish mutual trust between their countries, resolve some pressing international issues, and contribute to further easing international tensions and strengthening peace. As the declaration adopted by the recent World Peace Conference pointed out: "They bear a huge responsibility for the expectations of the whole world. Their primary responsibility is to overcome mutual distrust."

    Historical facts prove that relations of trust and cooperation can be established between major powers, and that mutual trust and cooperation between major powers has played a significant role in ensuring the security of all countries and maintaining world peace. During World War II, although the major powers bearing the main responsibility for the war had different social and political systems, they cooperated closely and used joint forces to defeat the fascist aggressors; although they had different opinions, they overcame differences through various meetings, especially meetings of heads of government, consolidating and strengthening the alliance. This spirit of cooperation was embodied in a series of documents, from the Four-Nation Declaration on General Security of the Soviet Union, the United States, China and the United Kingdom to the Potsdam Agreement. The Tehran Conference Declaration signed by the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on December 1, 1943, announced: "We express our determination that our countries will work together in war and in the subsequent peace." This cooperation was also manifested in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and its European Associates and of Post-War Collaboration and Mutual Assistance in May 1942, the Soviet-American Agreement on Principles Applying to Mutual Aid in the Prosecution of the War Against Aggression in June of the same year, and the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance in December 1944. Obviously, this mutual trust and cooperation between the strong anti-fascist alliance guaranteed the final victory of the Allied nations.

    Moreover, the major powers also recognized that their cooperation during the war must continue to be maintained and developed after the war in order to establish and maintain lasting world peace. As early as 1943, the Four-Nation Declaration of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and China declared: "The joint action agreed upon by them to wage war against the enemies of their respective countries shall be continued for the organization and maintenance of peace and security." The Tehran Declaration of the same year not only showed the determination of the major powers to work together in the war and the subsequent peace, but also clearly pointed out that "we are confident that our concord will make peace a permanent peace." This solemn declaration of mutual trust and cooperation by the major powers during the war provided the people of the world with a beautiful vision of peaceful cooperation among all countries after the war. At the same time, during the war, the major powers, in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation, signed a series of international agreements to provide a basis for resolving major international issues after the war. If these agreements were honestly observed by all major powers, they would create the necessary conditions for world peace after the war. It was based on the mutual trust and cooperation established in the anti-fascist war that the Charter of the United Nations was signed in San Francisco in June 1945, establishing a new international organization aimed at maintaining peace and ensuring security. The basic spirit of this charter is the principle of unanimous agreement among the major powers, and the effectiveness of the actions of this international organization depends on the harmony and cooperation of the major powers. At the United Nations Conference in San Francisco ten years ago, Molotov said: "If the leading democratic countries also show that they are able to act in concert in the post-war period, that will show that the interests of the cause of international peace and security have finally gained the most reliable support and protection." Post-war facts have also proved that as long as the major powers continue to maintain the spirit of cooperation, no international dispute cannot be resolved through consultation. The ten-year history of the United Nations is a clear example. In the early years of the United Nations, because the major powers, as permanent members of the Security Council, still showed a desire to implement international cooperation, the United Nations made some contributions to maintaining world peace and security. The United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission in January 1946, the resolution on general disarmament in December of the same year, and the resolution on the prohibition of new war propaganda in November 1947, can be said to be in line with the peace aspirations of the people of the world. Outside the United Nations, the major powers finally signed treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland in February 1947 after negotiations, which also had an indispensable significance for maintaining European security and peace.

    However, not all major powers are willing to continue to maintain the spirit of cooperation during the war, and not all major powers are willing to take joint action to establish and maintain world peace after the war. Even during the war, some people tried to undermine the establishment of the anti-fascist alliance, intentionally creating a tense situation after the war, full of new war threats. What they pursued after the war was not mutual trust and cooperation but division and hostility, not maintaining world peace and security but pursuing a policy of aggression.

    Ten years after the war, it is not difficult to find the answer to who undermined mutual trust and cooperation between major powers and who created international tensions. Turning to the history of the past ten years, countless facts come to one conclusion: the United States should bear the main responsibility for undermining international cooperation and creating the threat of war. The so-called "policy of strength" pursued by the ruling group of the United States and its followers is the root cause of the destruction of trust and cooperation between major powers during the war and the current world full of fear and anxiety.

    As early as the beginning of 1947, the current U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly called for "tough diplomacy towards the Soviet Union." This kind of diplomacy, no matter what name it uses - "Cold War policy," "overall diplomacy," "new look policy," "atomic diplomacy," its basic policy is only one, which is to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and prepare for new wars. In order to prepare for new wars, since the end of World War II, the U.S. ruling group immediately began systematic war propaganda, flatly denying the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two social systems, fabricating lies such as the "Soviet threat of aggression" and "communist expansion" out of thin air, spreading seeds of hostility and discord among countries, stirring up people's hearts with war clamoring, and undermining the atmosphere of international cooperation. Under the cover of this propaganda, the United States has not only not reduced its armaments since the end of the war, but has also stepped up its arms expansion and war preparations, especially the frantic manufacturing and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and even based its entire war preparation plan on the use of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, the United States maintains a huge garrison abroad and establishes a global network of military bases. The United States has no less than 1.5 million sea, land, and air forces stationed abroad, with nearly a thousand military bases. The United States has also established a series of military groups and alliances around the world, including the "North Atlantic Alliance," the "Southeast Asia Defense Group," the "Western European Union," the Middle East military group, and military agreements signed by the United States with Japan, Spain, South Korea, Pakistan, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. These military groups and alliances are all aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Moreover, the United States also launched a war of aggression to expand Indochina, and is now still trying its best to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Accords, continuing to create tension and unrest in the Far East. All these actions by the United States have increased international suspicion and hostility and deepened the threat of new wars. As the joint communique of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments pointed out on July 7, "The 'policy of strength' based on organizing military groups, establishing military bases, expanding armaments, and conducting war propaganda is completely contrary to the common desire of the people of the world to maintain international peace and collective security."

    Under the circumstances of the United States pursuing the so-called "policy of strength," not only has the meeting of the heads of government of the major powers been unable to convene since the Potsdam Conference in 1945, but the Foreign Ministers Conference established by the Potsdam Conference has also been interrupted for a long time since 1949. At the same time, the moral authority of the United Nations has declined, the principle of unanimity among the major powers has been repeatedly undermined, the United Nations agencies have been wantonly ruined, and the international organization for maintaining international peace and security has gradually degenerated into a tool for the United States to pursue its aggressive policies. It should be particularly pointed out that the United States has consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China, occupying China's territory Taiwan, constantly threatening and provoking the Chinese people, and unreasonably excluding the People's Republic of China from the United Nations organization, which is an important reason for the abnormal relations among the major powers.

    However, the ruling group of the United States cannot carry out its "policy of strength" as it pleases. What the people of the world seek is peace, not war; they express great disgust for division and hostility, and they express strong opposition to aggression and war. Anyone can see that the movement against wars of aggression and for world peace is rising, and the call for easing international tensions is getting louder and louder. Last year's Geneva Conference has set an example for major powers to achieve mutual trust and cooperation and resolve major international issues through consultation. Recently, a series of new major efforts by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries to ease international tensions and maintain world peace have provided favorable conditions for international cooperation. Under such strong pressure, the people of the world unanimously demanded the holding of a conference of major powers to restore mutual trust and cooperation between major powers and promote the normalization of international relations. It was only under such strong pressure that the United States agreed to hold a conference of major powers. U.S. President Eisenhower recently expressed the hope that the upcoming Four-Power Conference would help discover "a road that leads problems to new portals and will eventually find ways to ease tensions." He also acknowledged that the important issue is to build international trust. This is welcome. However, people also note the pessimistic atmosphere constantly emanating from Washington regarding the Four-Power Conference, as well as many arguments that are obviously intended to spread suspicion. This cannot but make people doubt the sincerity of the words of reconciliation published by the U.S. authorities, and suspect that these words are only to facilitate the shifting of responsibility for undermining international trust onto others. People have reasonable grounds to ask such questions: What attitude will the United States take to participate in the Four-Power Conference? Is it sincerely trying to achieve results at the conference and restore and enhance international trust and cooperation through this conference? Or is it paying lip service to reconciliation, but in fact trying to make the conference a failure and continue to obstruct mutual trust and cooperation between major powers in order to facilitate its continued arms expansion and war preparations? Things will soon become clear. In any case, the demand of the people of all countries to ease international tensions and build international trust has become a historical trend. Anyone who attempts to obstruct the realization of this common desire of the people of all countries will surely be opposed by the people of the world.

    恢复大国间互信合作是维护世界和平的基本因素
    王铁崖
    四国政府首脑会议从今天起在日内瓦召开。这是第二次世界大战结束以后十年来大国政府首脑头一次会晤。在今天全世界人民强烈要求缓和国际紧张局势和加强世界和平的时候，这个会议的召开是具有重大意义的。人们有理由要求，四大国政府首脑通过这次会议，建立彼此国家之间的互相信任，解决一些迫切的国际问题，为进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平作出贡献。正如最近召开的世界和平大会通过的宣言所指出：“他们对全世界的期望负有巨大的责任。他们的首要职责是克服相互间的不信任。”
    历史事实证明，大国之间是可以建立信任合作的关系的，而且大国之间的互信合作对于保障各国安全和维护世界和平曾经起了重大作用。在第二次世界大战期间，尽管在战争中负有主要责任的大国的社会和政治制度不同，但是它们曾经密切合作，用联合的力量来击败了法西斯侵略者；尽管它们存在着不同的意见，但是它们曾通过各种会议，特别是通过政府首脑的会晤，克服了分歧，巩固和增强了联盟的力量。这种合作的精神曾经体现在从苏中美英四国关于普遍安全的宣言到波茨坦协定的一系列文件之中。一九四三年十二月一日苏、美、英三国领袖所签署的德黑兰会议宣言宣布：“我们表示我们的决心：我们的国家在战争方面，以及在随后的和平方面，都将共同工作。”这种合作也表现于一九四二年五月的英苏战时同盟反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国并在战后合作互助条约、同年六月的苏美关于进行反侵略战争中实行互助诸原则的协定，和一九四四年十二月的法苏同盟互助条约上。显然，反法西斯联盟强国之间的这种互信合作保证了联合国家的最后胜利。
    不仅如此，各大国并且认定，它们在战争期间的合作在战后也须继续维持和发展，以为建立和维护世界的持久和平而努力。早在一九四三年，苏中美英四国宣言曾经宣告：“他们为对各该国的敌人进行战争而约定的联合行动，当为和平与安全的组织和维系，而继续保持下去。”同年的德黑兰宣言不仅表明大国在战争以及随后的和平方面共同工作的决心，而且明确地指出，“我们确信：我们的和协，必将使和平成为一种永久的和平。”大国战时的这种互信合作的庄严宣言，曾经给全世界人民提供了一幅战后各国和平合作的美好前景。同时，在战争期间，各大国本着互信合作的精神，签订一系列国际协议，为战后国际重大问题提供解决的根据。这些协议如果被所有大国所诚实遵守，就会造成战后世界和平的必要条件。正是基于在反法西斯战争中建立起来的互信和合作，一九四五年六月在旧金山签订了联合国宪章，建立了旨在维护和平、保障安全的新的国际组织。这个宪章的基本精神是大国一致协议的原则，这个国际组织的行动的效力依靠于大国的和协合作。在十年前的旧金山联合国会议上，莫洛托夫说过：“假如各主导的民主国家在战后时期也表明自己能够协力动作，那就会是说明国际和平安全事业利益终于获得了最可靠的支持和保护了。”战后的事实也证明，只要大国之间继续保持合作的精神，没有什么国际的争端是不可以通过协商而求得解决的。联合国十年的历史就是一个显明的例证。在联合国成立初年，由于作为安全理事会常任理事国的大国还都表现一种实行国际合作的愿望，联合国曾经对于维护世界和平和安全作过一些贡献。联合国大会的一九四六年一月关于成立原子能委员会的决议，同年十二月关于普遍裁军的决议以及一九四七年十一月关于禁止新战争宣传的决议等，应该说是符合全世界人民的和平愿望的。在联合国之外，大国经过谈判终于在一九四七年二月签订了对意、保、罗、匈、芬五国和约，对于维护欧洲的安全和和平，也有不可忽视的意义。
    但是，并不是所有大国都愿意继续保持战争期间的合作的精神的，并不是所有大国都愿意以共同行动来建立和维护战后的世界和平的。甚至在战争进行期间，已经有人力图破坏当时反法西斯联盟的建立，有意制造战后的紧张的、充满着新战争威胁的局势。他们在战后所追求的不是互信合作而是分裂和敌视，不是维护世界和平和安全而是推行侵略政策。
    在战后十年的今天，追问谁破坏大国之间的互信合作，谁制造国际紧张局面，答案是不难找到的。翻开过去十年的历史，无数的事实归结到一个结论：美国应负破坏国际合作和制造战争威胁的主要责任。美国统治集团及其追随者所奉行的所谓“实力政策”，就是战时大国间的信任和合作遭到破坏、目今世界充满恐惧和不安的根源。
    远在一九四七年初，现在的美国国务卿杜勒斯就公然号召“对苏联进行强硬外交”。这种外交，不论用什么名称——“冷战政策”，“总体外交”，“新面貌政策”，“原子外交”，其基本方针只有一个，就是反对苏联和人民民主国家，准备新战争。为了准备新战争，自从第二次世界大战结束之后，美国统治集团立即开始有系统的战争宣传，一口否定两个社会制度和平共处的可能性，无中生有地捏造什么“苏联侵略威胁”和“共产主义扩张”之类的鬼话，在各国间散布敌对和不和的种子，用战争叫嚣来搅乱人心，败坏国际合作的气氛。在这种宣传的掩护下面，美国战后以来不仅没有裁减军备，而且加紧扩军备战，特别是疯狂地制造和囤积原子武器和氢武器，甚至把整个备战计划建立在使用大规模屠杀人类的武器的基础上。同时，美国在国外维持庞大的驻军，建立全球性的军事基地网。美国驻在国外的海、陆、空军不下一百五十万人，军事基地近千个。美国还在全世界建立了一系列的军事集团和联盟，包括“北大西洋联盟”、“东南亚防务集团”、“西欧联盟”、中东军事集团以及美国同日本、西班牙、南朝鲜、巴基斯坦和蒋介石卖国集团等签订的军事协定。这些军事集团和联盟都是矛头指向苏联和人民民主国家的。不仅如此，美国还发动了侵略扩大印度支那的战争，现在还在竭力破坏朝鲜停战协定和日内瓦协定，继续制造远东的紧张和不安。美国的这一切所作所为，增加了国际间的猜疑和敌视，加深了新战争的威胁。正如七月七日中越两国政府联合公报所指出，“以组织军事集团、建立军事基地、扩充军备、进行战争宣传为基础的‘实力政策’是完全违反世界人民维护国际和平和集体安全的共同愿望的。”
    在美国推行所谓“实力政策”的情况下，不仅从一九四五年波茨坦会议以后大国政府首脑会议无法召开，而且波茨坦会议决定设立的外长会议也从一九四九年以后长期中断了。同时，联合国的道义权威日益低落，大国一致的原则屡被破坏，联合国机构横被糟蹋，使维护国际和平和安全的国际组织逐渐堕落成为美国推行侵略政策的工具。特别应该指出，美国对于中华人民共和国一贯采取敌视的态度，侵占中国的领土台湾，不断地对中国人民进行恫吓和挑衅，并无理地把中华人民共和国排斥于联合国组织之外，是各大国关系不正常的一个重要原因。
    但是，美国统治集团并不能遂心顺意地进行它的“实力政策”的。全世界人民所企求的是和平而不是战争；他们对于分裂和敌视表示极大的厌恶，他们对于侵略和战争表示强烈的反对。任何人都看到反对侵略战争、争取世界和平的运动日益高涨，要求缓和国际局势的呼声愈来愈响亮。去年的日内瓦会议已经树立了大国之间取得互信合作、通过协商以解决国际重大问题的榜样。最近以来，苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他爱好和平国家的一系列缓和国际局势和维护世界和平的新的重大努力，已经提供了国际合作的有利条件。在这样的情况之下，全世界人民一致要求举行大国会议，恢复大国之间的互信合作，促使国际关系正常化。只是在这样强大的压力下，美国才同意了举行大国会议。美国总统艾森豪威尔最近表示希望即将举行的四国会议有助于发现“把问题导向新门径的道路，并且最后将找出和缓紧张局势的方法”。他还承认重要的问题是建立国际的信任。这是值得欢迎的。但是人们同时注意到从华盛顿方面不断散播出来的对于四国会议的悲观空气，以及许多显然意在散布猜疑的论调。这就不能不使人怀疑美国当局发表的和解词句的诚意，怀疑这些词句不过是为了便于把破坏国际信任的责任推在别人头上。人们有合理的根据提出这样的疑问：美国究竟将抱着什么样的态度参加四国会议，是真心诚意使会议取得成果，通过这一次会议来恢复和增进国际的信任合作呢？还是空谈和解，实际上却是力图使会议一事无成，继续阻挠大国间的信任合作以便利它继续扩军备战？事情很快就会分晓。无论如何各国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际信任已经成为历史的潮流，谁要企图阻挠实现各国人民的这种共同愿望，它一定会遭到全世界人民一致的反对。
