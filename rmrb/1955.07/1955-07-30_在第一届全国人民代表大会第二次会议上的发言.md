Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 30, 1955

Now I will give some explanations on the situation of our country's foreign trade to the representatives.

With the development of our national economic construction, our foreign trade has already developed and will continue to develop significantly. In 1957, our foreign trade volume is expected to increase by 66.5% compared to 1952. It should be noted that the five-year development target for foreign trade mentioned above is only a control and aspirational target. Because foreign trade involves both our country and foreign countries, it is not entirely determined by one side. Its development is inseparable from the development and changes in domestic and foreign production and markets, as well as the enhancement of international relations. At the same time, our country has just implemented a planned economy, and due to the temporary inaccuracies in planning, as well as the temporary needs in industry and other aspects of construction, and the fact that agricultural product exports are often affected by the harvest, there will inevitably be situations where some imported and exported goods are advanced, delayed, increased, or decreased. Therefore, it is necessary to specifically grasp and adjust these situations based on needs and possibilities each year. In summary, the overall trend of our foreign trade is to develop year by year, and the trade volume is to increase year by year, but some years may see faster growth, some years may see slower growth, and some years may see a temporary slight reduction in trade with certain countries, which is completely understandable.

The import and export trade in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan was generally balanced and basically completed the tasks assigned by the state. In 1954, the total import and export value of the country was 8,486,730,000 yuan, and the weight of imported and exported goods reached over 9 million tons. This scale of foreign trade is enormous and reflects the rapid development of our national economic construction. In 1954, the total import value included 88.5% of materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and other construction (such as complete sets of equipment, industrial materials, industrial raw materials, fertilizers, etc.), and 11.5% of materials to meet the daily needs of the people (such as sugar, cloth, paper, medicine, kerosene, etc.). The proportion of imported materials in 1953 was also roughly the same. This is fundamentally different from the situation during the Kuomintang regime, where imported living materials accounted for more than 50% of the total value. Imperialist countries used large quantities of luxury goods and consumer goods to dump into our country, absorb our wealth, hinder the development of our national industry, and keep our country in a state of poverty and weakness, dependent on imperialist countries.

According to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, within five years, the imported materials will first include the equipment and important materials needed by 156 industrial construction units designed by the Soviet Union during this period. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure the import of materials necessary for other industries, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. In addition, we also import a part of light industrial raw materials that are not produced or insufficiently produced domestically and a part of daily necessities to improve and raise the living standards of the people.

To ensure the realization of the first Five-Year Plan for national industrialization, we must use exported goods to exchange for the imported materials needed for construction. That is to say, exports are for imports, and imports are for the socialist industrialization of our country. Therefore, organizing the sources of exported goods and ensuring the supply of exports is a direct and powerful support for our national industrial construction. But it is not about exporting without limit. Instead, it is to export according to the impact of commodities on the domestic market, the possibility of exports, and the needs of imports. The main part of the exported goods in the next five years will still be agricultural and local products.

In 1954 and 1955, the export of grain maintained the level of 1953, and it is planned to maintain this level in the next two years. In 1954, the export of edible vegetable oil was reduced by 36% compared to 1953, and it is planned to maintain the 1954 level in the following years. The commodities planned to be increased in export in the next five years are mainly local products (tea, silk, tung oil, tobacco leaves, peach kernels, almonds, walnuts, straw braids, peppermint oil, raw lacquer, yellow flower fungus, wood ear, various Chinese medicinal materials, etc.), animal products (pigs, intestines, hides, feathers, wool, cashmere, etc.), as well as fruits, meats, handicrafts, and mineral products. The increase in the export of these commodities will have little impact on the lives of our people but will be very beneficial for promoting the development of agricultural sideline industries and handicrafts in our rural areas and increasing the income of farmers, herdsmen, and handicraftsmen. In the past, we made mistakes in the pricing of individual commodities, which affected sales. This phenomenon should be seriously avoided in the future to ensure that all our exported commodities maintain reasonable prices. In addition, since last year, some of our light industrial products such as iron wire, nails, knitted products, thermos bottles, fountain pens, and gauze have begun to be exported abroad, with an annual export value of approximately 150 million yuan. These industrial products are welcomed by the local people and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. However, the specifications and quality of our industrial products need to be improved, and the cost needs to be reduced. With the development of our industry, the possibility of exporting our industrial products will also gradually increase.

Some people say that the current exports are too much, affecting the supply in the domestic market? According to the needs of state construction and economic development, the export of various materials in our country is not excessive at present. Except for the limited export of grain and oil, other materials such as pork, eggs, tea, silk, and fruits are not considered much. For example, in 1954, the export of pork (including live pigs and canned pork) accounted for only 6% of domestic consumption, the export of eggs accounted for 10% of production, the export of apples accounted for 18% of production, the export of tea accounted for 27% of production, and the export of raw silk accounted for 63% of production. Some major exported commodities have not yet reached the pre-war export level, such as tea exports in 1954, which were only 65% of the export volume in 1936, and raw silk exports, which were only 32% of the export volume in 1931. In addition, there are still many local products whose export volume has not reached the pre-war export level. We are an agricultural country, and for those things that have little relation to people's lives, we should appropriately save domestic consumption and ensure export needs. As long as we each save a little meat, eggs, and fruits every month, there will be a large quantity available for export, which can be exchanged for a large number of machinery and equipment to support national industrialization. Moreover, we still waste many materials in use, for example, some units have made many leather chairs and sofas, and the market has many poorly made leather shoes, balls, bags, and notebooks. If we save them seriously, there will be many hides available for export. As for other things that have little relation to people's lives, we should organize their export as much as possible. If we do not save domestic consumption appropriately to supply exports, it will affect the import of materials necessary for national industrial construction and will affect the socialist industrialization of the country. We all love our country. We not only love the current country but also love the prosperous and strong country after industrialization. We should not only cherish the immediate interests of the people but also cherish the long-term interests of the people and make the immediate interests serve the long-term interests. The eternal happiness of the future must be fought for through the current united efforts of the entire nation.

To ensure the supply of exported goods, in addition to saving consumption appropriately, it is also necessary to develop production and strengthen the procurement work. Our country's potential for exported goods is not small. The Five-Year Plan draft has already set targets for the increased production of exported goods such as tea and silk. Most of our exported local products have great potential for increased production. We should strive to increase the unit yield per acre and, on the principle of not competing with major crops, expand the planting area as much as possible. The procurement work of the foreign trade department and other departments for exported goods has a significant relationship with promoting the development of production. In this regard, we have achieved some results in recent years, but there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. For example, in early 1953, due to our insufficient foresight of the domestic and foreign market demand, we only saw the temporary accumulation of some materials and adopted the wrong measures of lowering prices and reducing procurement for some exported goods. Although this has been basically corrected, it has caused considerable damage to the enthusiasm for production. We must always remember this lesson in the future. The procurement prices of some exported commodities sometimes have excessive fluctuations; there is also insufficient consideration for different regions and economic conditions. We are now studying the opinions reflected by various places to make necessary adjustments to ensure the benefits of farmers and encourage them to actively increase production. In the procurement work, over the years, in concentrated production areas and concentrated selling seasons, some places have had the problem of not being able to sell on the same day, delaying the work of farmers; the planning methods of some commodities are also too complicated. The procurement specifications of some commodities are also not entirely appropriate, and the propaganda and education work on specifications requirements is also insufficient. All these need to be continuously improved.

Our trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries is completely based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance and is conducted according to the needs and possibilities of both sides. This new type of international trade relationship has a significant role in promoting the common prosperity of the economies of the socialist camp. Through foreign trade, the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union, have provided us with tremendous assistance. The growth rate of our trade volume with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries is very fast. For example, if 1950 is taken as 100, it has risen to 500 in 1954. The goods supplied by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country are mostly materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and other aspects of construction. In 1954, the proportion of these materials supplied by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country was as high as 93.9%. The complete sets of equipment imported by our country are mainly supplied by the Soviet Union, followed by the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe have supplied us with a large number of materials year after year, such as various working machines, mining, transportation, and construction machinery, various steel materials, non-ferrous metals, electrical and telecommunications equipment, precision instruments, oil, chemical raw materials, etc., all of which are materials embargoed by American imperialism to us, but the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have satisfied our needs in production and construction with brotherly friendship. Moreover, these machines and equipment, as well as various materials, are technologically advanced and of the highest quality. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have also supplied us with a large number of urgently needed industrial raw materials and daily necessities, such as kerosene, medicine, pesticides, chemical raw materials, fertilizers, cotton, etc. After the implementation of the "embargo" by American imperialism, many of our materials that were originally exported to Western countries have been redirected to the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and thus many of our exported materials have also secured stable markets in recent years. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has also accepted many of our new exported commodities, such as canned goods, fruits, knitted products, and handicrafts, which have important roles in promoting the development of our industry, handicrafts, agriculture, and their sideline industries.

The commodities exchanged between our country and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries are priced according to the principle of fair and reasonable pricing agreed upon by both sides. Prices are basically unchanged after being determined by both sides, and only necessary and reasonable adjustments are made to the prices of individual commodities each year. In recent years, the prices in the capitalist world market have been fluctuating, but the trade prices between our country and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have not been affected and have remained stable. This has greatly facilitated our planned economic construction. Undoubtedly, trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries is the solid and reliable foundation for ensuring the normal development of our foreign trade.

Our trade relations with Southeast Asian countries have made new progress in 1954. In 1954, our country signed a trade agreement and a rice-for-goods exchange agreement with Burma, a trade agreement and a payment agreement with Indonesia, and a trade agreement and a tobacco-silk exchange agreement with India. Our rice-gum exchange contract with Ceylon has been successfully implemented for more than two years. Our trade relations with Pakistan are also continuing to develop. We are also actively conducting trade with African countries. Our country and the countries of Southeast Asia and Africa have had common experiences and circumstances. For these countries that advocate peace and economic revival, we will further cooperate with them on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, respecting national sovereignty. Our trade with them is peaceful and friendly, and there are no special privileges required by either party. We believe that the development of such trade will greatly benefit the improvement of the lives of the people in various countries, the promotion of peaceful coexistence, and the enhancement of understanding and friendship between governments and peoples. Regarding trade with Japan, although there has been some development in recent years, due to the Japanese government's continued implementation of the American "embargo" policy, the current trade volume is not only far from the pre-war level but has not even recovered to the level of 1950. We hope that this situation will change.

Our trade with Western countries has had some development since liberation, but due to the obstruction of the American imperialist "blockade" and "embargo," the trade volume with this market dropped significantly in the second half of 1951. However, due to our consistent policy of developing normal international economic relations and the increasing realization by many businessmen in Western countries that trade restrictions and discriminatory policies are primarily detrimental to them, the trade volume between our country and Western countries has risen again in 1953. If they can truly take measures to eliminate the artificial obstacles to peaceful trade, then the prospects for further developing trade with them in the future will be immense.

In summary, our trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries is the basic part of our foreign trade, but we also attach importance to trade with Asian and African countries and Western countries. At the same time, we are willing to develop trade relations with any country in the world that is willing to establish economic ties with us, regardless of differences in social systems. We have always done this in the past and will continue to do so in the future. We firmly oppose policies that hinder the interests of the peoples of the world, such as "blockades," "embargos," and trade discrimination that obstructs shipping. However, we must emphasize that the facts of the past few years have proven that the implementation of the "embargo" policy has only increased the difficulties of the countries that follow America's "embargo," and has not restricted the development of our country's thriving economic construction.

Foreign trade control and protection policies have protected the recovery and development of our independent economy and prevented private importers and exporters from engaging in speculative activities harmful to the national economy. This policy should be further strengthened and implemented in the future.

For private importers and exporters, we will continue to implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming them. On the one hand, we will continue to maintain those legitimate businesses with operational capabilities, allowing them to have business to do and profits to make. On the other hand, for those private importers and exporters that have no operational capabilities and have become paralyzed, we will implement a unified arrangement to absorb their employees; for those who engage in speculation, smuggling, and resist socialist transformation, we will deal with them in a timely and appropriate manner. This is beneficial for employees, private businesses, and society.

To accumulate funds needed for industrialization, foreign trade must implement strict savings in every operational link. In recent years, the operational management of state-owned foreign trade enterprises has been continuously improved, but the results of a recent comprehensive inspection show that there are still many wasteful phenomena in our enterprise operations, which cannot but cause us serious concern. For example, the China Grain and Oil Export Corporation's Xinhuang Refinery, due to the lack of strict operating procedures, caused serious spillage and leakage of grain and oil during loading and unloading. Grain spilled on the ground, except for what was swept up, was trampled into the ground, eaten by birds, gnawed by rats, and sprouted. The pump room, due to improper handling of the oil pipes, spilled 600 jin of cottonseed oil into the river during loading. Various items in the factory were thrown everywhere, exposed to wind and rain, and workers complained, "Our factory workers are stepping on money." Some units have chaotic accounts and unclear assets. The losses and waste caused by errors in procurement, ordering, and transportation in various units are also considerable. There have also been cases of embezzlement. We are currently continuing to inspect and deal with these phenomena of wasting national resources and not cherishing national resources. The problems in operational management are related to the bureaucratism and formalism of leaders at all levels. Many leaders are buried in piles of official documents and cannot go deep into the grassroots level. Many cadres are busy with documents and cannot delve into business. The inspection found that last year, the department received 68,000 unnecessary copies of documents. We are currently formulating plans to improve operational management and savings in conjunction with the reorganization work, and conducting detailed audits. We plan to save 430 million yuan for the state, save 1 billion yuan of state-funded funds, and save 380 million yuan of administrative expenses from administrative expenditures, basic construction investments, and various operational links this year. At the same time, we have formulated measures to overcome bureaucratism, formalism, and documentarism, go deep into the grassroots level, and strengthen actual and specific leadership.

In the foreign trade department, the vast majority of employees are good people who work diligently, which is one of the main factors for the achievements of foreign trade work. However, there are indeed some people who disguise themselves as progressives but actually collude with domestic and foreign enemies to steal economic intelligence, create errors, and engage in other sabotage activities. These hidden counter-revolutionaries have only been exposed recently, which shows the serious situation of political complacency and impure teams in the past. We are currently continuing to mobilize the masses, keep our eyes open, and must thoroughly purge these hidden counter-revolutionaries to ensure the purity of our foreign trade team and enable our foreign trade to better serve the realization of the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction.

All employees of the foreign trade department, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, have the confidence and determination to ensure the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan and the realization of the 1955 financial budget. We sincerely accept the many valuable suggestions made by the representatives regarding our work and will pay attention to improving our future work. Our enterprises are distributed throughout the country and need the supervision and inspection of the party and government leaders of various provinces and municipalities. We also welcome the representatives to criticize and correct our work at any time to spur our progress.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is a highly scientific document and is our goal of struggle under the guidance of the general line for the whole nation. It declares to the world: the six hundred million people of all China have advanced in big strides on the road to building socialism! I wholeheartedly support the entire content of this plan and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun!

Recently, I visited the Northeast with twenty-seven academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We saw many newly built, expanded, and reconstructed large-scale projects under construction, and many completed enterprises developing vigorously. These are the fruits of the hard work of worker comrades day and night under the guidance of Soviet experts, which has greatly educated us and also made us very excited. It is as if we have seen our socialist society, which has given us a deeper understanding and stronger confidence in the socialist industrialization of our country; that is, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the great Soviet government and people, and through the hard work of the people of the whole country, we will definitely complete and even overfulfill this first great Five-Year Plan!

Our Five-Year Plan is completely in line with the basic economic law of socialism. The great Stalin defined this economic law as follows: to use methods that continuously increase and perfect socialist production on a high technological basis to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society. In our plan, the needs of the whole society in all aspects have been set to increase year by year. Therefore, in terms of production and circulation in industry, agriculture, transportation, postal services, commerce, and other aspects, the quantity and quality have also been set to increase year by year, and the guarantee is the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the continuous reduction of production costs in each enterprise. How can we continuously improve labor productivity and continuously reduce costs? According to the above definition, it is to do so on a high technological basis. Here, I think the word "high" refers to the speed of improvement, not the absolute level. As long as our technological basis is continuously improved and there is no stagnation or regression, no matter how weak our original technological basis is, our technology can be explained as high. This guarantee of a high technological basis has been fully demonstrated in our Five-Year Plan. This is: the continuous exploration of our vast natural resources, the continuous mechanization of various enterprises, and the continuous and vigorous cultivation and development of construction cadres and scientific research work. Therefore, our Five-Year Plan is completely in line with the basic economic law of socialism. The superiority of socialism in our China has been fully proven by ironclad facts, and therefore, our Five-Year Plan is definitely achievable and even overfulfillable.

Now I would like to offer a few suggestions on the technological foundation of our country. To cultivate construction cadres and technical workers, we should vigorously develop adult education, especially correspondence education, which has been specially emphasized in the plan draft and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun. Cadres and workers are different from young students. They not only have stronger political tempering but also have a certain amount of business knowledge and experience. Their education should not adopt the procedures and methods of general professional schools, just as teaching adults to read is different from teaching children to read, because so-called illiterates often only lack the ability to read characters, not the ability to understand texts. Therefore, the adult education of cadres and workers should be closely linked to work tasks, starting from learning the technical theory of business and gradually deepening into basic natural sciences. For example, a lathe worker who has mastered cutting technology should learn the structural principles of the lathe immediately after learning the structure of the lathe, and then learn mathematics and physics related to these principles. From sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, from knowing "how" to knowing "why." They should learn natural sciences not detached from their current work but start from scratch with mathematics and physics. This is the traditional educational method of general schools for young students, which is not suitable for cadres and workers. First, learn business technology, then learn professional theory, and finally learn basic sciences. I think this is completely possible. Here, we should also vigorously develop national scientific and technological popularization work as a powerful assistant for adult education, which has achieved extremely great success in the Soviet Union.

The importance of scientific research work has been clearly stated in the plan draft and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun. The cultivation of cadres is already a slow process, and the development of scientific research requires even more time, because the improvement of science is based on the popularization of science. However, the Five-Year Plan has urgent requirements for scientific research, just as it does for the cultivation of cadres, and we must take appropriate measures to eliminate this contradiction. (1) Fully utilize the human and material resources in existing scientific research institutions, avoid duplication and waste, strengthen weak links, and establish an economic accounting mindset among research personnel. (2) Firmly establish the system of scientific research serving production, determine the service objects of each research institution, strengthen the coordination and cooperation between various research institutions, and make the coordination and cooperation of research work adapt to the coordination and cooperation of enterprise production, and strive together to improve labor productivity and reduce costs. (3) Open the doors of scientific research institutions to enterprise innovators, allowing them to complete their technological innovations in a scientific research environment. (4) Make the research work of higher education institutions serve production and construction through teaching. (5) Expand the academic activities of various professional associations in natural sciences to complement the research work in production, and make the work of these associations play a bridging role in production, education, and research. (6) Connect the inventions and rationalization proposals of enterprises with relevant scientific research work, forming many specialized scientific work networks, and then organizing these networks into a national scientific research network. We should expand scientific research work to the scale of the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign to ensure the technological health of all enterprises in the Five-Year Plan.

The task of all scientific and technological personnel in the Five-Year Plan is very arduous. In addition to strengthening our work at each post to improve our technological foundation, we should vigorously support the work of liberating Taiwan, restoring our territorial sovereignty, expanding the natural resources and technological foundation of our economic construction, and participating in the work of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries. Through the victory of class struggle, we will safeguard the achievements of the Five-Year Plan. Let all scientific and technological workers, closely united around the Communist Party of China, accelerate the completion of several Five-Year Plans one by one, and strive to build our motherland into a great socialist country!

I fully agree with and support the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council on behalf of the State Council on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan," the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council on behalf of the State Council on "The 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," and the report by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on behalf of the State Council on "The Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China." After listening to these reports, I have a clearer understanding of the main contents of the First Five-Year Plan and the tasks of the people of all ethnic groups in the transitional period to strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. At the same time, I have a deeper understanding and understanding of the key construction policies in the Five-Year Plan, the policy of comprehensive consideration in production, the necessity of coordinated development among various sectors of the national economy, and the need for active and steady progress in the socialist transformation. The realization and completion of the First Five-Year Plan will lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country, begin to change the historical face of our country's economic backwardness for a hundred years; promote the further development of economic and cultural undertakings of various ethnic minorities in our country, and push our country towards the goal of an industrialized socialist society. With the realization of this plan, the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in our country will gradually improve. Therefore, this plan is completely in line with the long-term and highest interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The people of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province wholeheartedly support this plan and will strive to realize and complete this plan.

Since liberation, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the higher-level people's government, and Chairman Mao, gone through land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns, especially due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great national policy, the implementation of regional autonomy, which has greatly inspired the high enthusiasm and creativity of the laboring people of all ethnic groups in the Yanbian region in labor production. Therefore, by 1953, the national economy of the Yanbian region has been fully restored and partially developed, and it is possible to enter the stage of planned economic construction with other regions of the country from 1953.

The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is a place where agricultural production is the mainstay, and the focus of economic development should be on agricultural production. Therefore, we must, according to the general spirit and provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, do a good job in increasing agricultural production. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan": "Agricultural production supplies food for the people of the whole country, and at the same time, industrial products using agricultural products as raw materials account for more than 50% of the total industrial output value of the country at present, and most of the foreign exchange needed to import industrial equipment and construction materials is also obtained from the export of agricultural products. Therefore, the development of agriculture is the basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan." This clearly illustrates the importance of developing agricultural production for the completion of our country's First Five-Year Plan and the construction of socialist undertakings. To develop agricultural production, the Yanbian region, according to the instructions of the higher-level party and government, has been actively leading and steadily advancing under the principle of active leadership. Since 1948, mutual aid and cooperation movements have been launched in rural areas. By the spring of 1955, the number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the whole region accounted for 52.3% of the total number of agricultural households. In addition, the number of households organized into various mutual aid groups accounted for about 40% of the total number of agricultural households. By the end of 1957, the number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the whole region may reach about 70% of the total number of agricultural households.

Due to the fact that Yanbian is a multi-ethnic region, in leading agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation movements, we have paid attention to the development of multi-ethnic (mainly Korean and Han) agricultural production cooperatives. Such cooperatives not only help each other in labor but also learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses in production technology, exchange experiences, and achieve the goal of increasing production; moreover, they also strengthen national unity on the basis of common labor. Such national unity agricultural production cooperatives have become the direction for the development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future.

In addition, due to the large forest area in Yanbian, we have also organized agricultural and forestry combined cooperatives according to the principle of local conditions. For this type of agricultural and forestry cooperative, we should pay attention to accumulating experience in the future to promote it in forestry areas step by step.

Next, the supply and credit cooperative undertakings in rural areas have also developed accordingly. At present, 202 primary supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in the whole autonomous region, with 337,495 members and a capital of 10,744,905 yuan, basically ensuring the supply of production and living materials for farmers.

Since 1954, the credit departments originally attached to rural supply and marketing cooperatives have been gradually transformed into credit cooperatives. At present, there are 112 rural credit cooperatives and 2 credit departments in the whole region, with a total capital of 372,005 yuan and a circulating fund of 2,644,419 yuan.

The development of production, supply, and credit cooperatives and the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain since 1953 have greatly reduced the possibility of the growth of capitalist spontaneous forces in rural areas, opening up a broad road for increasing grain production and completing the socialist transformation of individual agriculture.

Based on the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, we have adopted and will continue to adopt the following measures to increase grain production: encouraging farmers to cultivate intensively, improve agricultural production technology, and increase the yield per unit area; rewarding farmers for opening up small wastelands, expanding the cultivated area; building water conservancy projects, preventing water and drought disasters, and avoiding crop reduction, as well as rewarding farmers for converting dry fields to paddy fields and increasing rice production, etc.

Due to the fact that the Yanbian region has suffered from unprecedented and irresistible disasters in the past two years, the total grain production of the whole region has decreased compared to 1952. However, as mentioned above, we have achieved certain results in the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of agricultural production technology. This proves that the policies of the higher-level party and government are completely correct.

According to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, if there are no particularly serious disasters, we are confident that we can complete and overfulfill the grain production plan.

In recent years, we have achieved certain results in agricultural production work, which are inseparable from the correct leadership and care of the Communist Party of China, the higher-level people's government, and Chairman Mao, as well as the active efforts and support of a large number of cadres and the masses. However, due to our low level and insufficient efforts, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. First, in the issue of socialist transformation of agriculture, we have not been able to fully implement the policy of active leadership and steady progress, sometimes rushing ahead, sometimes being conservative; second, in the promotion of advanced agricultural production experience and the implementation of high-yield fields, we have not been realistic and adapted to local conditions, but rather have the problem of mechanically copying the experience of other regions to a certain extent. All the above shortcomings must be overcome and corrected in our future work.

In addition to agricultural production, other work in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has also achieved certain results in recent years, and there are also many shortcomings and errors, which I will not elaborate on here.

Our country's First Five-Year Plan is a great plan. Its realization and completion will make our country more prosperous and powerful, and it will bring a bright and happy future to the ethnic minorities in our country. In the struggle to realize the First Five-Year Plan, we ethnic minorities have the honor and responsibility of bearing a heavy burden. We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the higher-level people's government, and Chairman Mao, further strengthen national unity, work together, increase production, practice economy, maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and overcoming difficulties; further enhance revolutionary vigilance, prevent and eliminate all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan, and ensure the victory of socialism in our country.

I fully agree with the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan," the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on "The 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," the report by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on "The Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China," the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of water resources, and the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Last year, the Yangtze River region, in its struggle against floods, achieved a great victory, which played a major role in ensuring national economic construction. Hubei Province is one of the severely affected provinces along the river, and everyone has been very concerned about the disaster relief work in Hubei Province. Now I will speak about Hubei Province's production and disaster relief work over the past year.

In the summer of 1954, Hubei Province suffered a once-in-a-century flood, the largest recorded in water history. The people of the entire province fought an unprecedented, heroic, and tenacious battle against the flood, ensuring the safety of the Jingjiang Dike, the North Dike of the Han River, and industrial cities such as Wuhan and Huangshi, and reducing the disaster to the minimum. The party and government leadership at all levels and the vast number of rural cadres all led and organized the disaster-stricken masses to move to non-disaster areas day and night, regardless of wind and rain. As the water receded, we led and organized the disaster-stricken people to return home and rebuild their homes. We promptly transported large quantities of grain, building materials, coal, firewood, oil, and salt to solve the difficulties of food and shelter for the disaster-stricken people. At the same time, we led the disaster-stricken people to block the breaches and drain the water, and rushed to plant 120.9 million mu of late autumn and winter crops, and developed sideline production.

The disaster areas are currently carrying out intensive recovery work. Since late November of last year, they have been hit by two consecutive cold waves and heavy snow. The snow on the ground is one to three feet deep. Except for the main channel of the Yangtze River, all rivers and lakes are frozen. More than 60 ships are frozen in the Han River, and many wooden boats are crushed by the ice, and water and land transportation is suddenly cut off, which is also a rare occurrence in history. In this situation, we mobilized as urgently as we did during the flood prevention and rescue, adhering to the central government's spirit of "saving people first," immediately organized more than 8,000 cadres at all levels to brave the icy rivers and snowstorms, and went deep into the villages to carry out emergency rescue. To restore transportation and ensure the supply of materials to the disaster areas, we mobilized more than 500,000 people to shovel snow and ice along the roads, blew open the Han River navigation channel with explosives, organized the transportation forces of the entire province, and transported grain, firewood, and other materials to the disaster areas. We distributed more than 150,000 sets of cotton clothes and more than 90,000 cotton quilts, rushed to repair more than 160,000 houses, and distributed more than 31.63 million yuan in relief grain, housing subsidies, and cattle feed, ensuring that the disaster-stricken people safely survived the winter.

The great flood and heavy snow have caused a serious spring famine and great difficulties in spring production this year. To help the disaster-stricken people overcome the spring famine and smoothly carry out spring production, in addition to continuing to distribute a large amount of relief grain and funds, we have adjusted and purchased from Jiangsu, Sichuan, and seven other provinces and our own non-disaster areas and transported more than 50,000 cattle to the disaster areas; from Jiangsu, Sichuan, and seven other provinces and our own non-disaster areas, we have purchased and transported more than 1.897 billion jin of seeds to the disaster areas, and for those who cannot afford to buy seeds, we have issued seed loans totaling 7.5 million yuan. In addition, we have supplied and repaired a large number of farming tools for the disaster-stricken people. Due to these efforts, the spring production plan in the disaster areas has been successfully completed. At the same time, we have carried out large-scale dike repair and restoration projects, completing approximately 70 million cubic meters of earthwork, which will provide a more reliable guarantee for future flood prevention.

Representatives, the severe natural disasters have been overcome by us in the past year. Such a great victory is unprecedented in history. As the disaster-stricken farmers said, "A once-in-a-century great flood, a once-in-a-thousand-years good government." This is first of all due to the personal care and wise leadership of the central government and Chairman Mao; it is due to the great support from all over the country. The central government has given us instructions many times, allocated more than 107 million yuan in relief funds, and more than 20 million yuan in various loans and cotton pre-purchase funds; from the central health departments and provinces such as Guizhou and Guangdong, a large number of medical personnel were dispatched to assist in medical and health work in our province's disaster areas. The disaster-stricken people said, "The water is so big, the power is so big, whatever you want, you have it, Chairman Mao's New China is like a family." Recall the situation under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1931, when the water level in Wuhan City rose to more than 26 meters, the dikes collapsed and the city was flooded, and the entire city was flooded for four months. Within three or four days of the flood entering the city, more than 1,000 floating corpses were fished out, and according to the records of the fake government, at that time, Wuhan City urgently needed relief for "more than 500,000 people." In just a few "thousand-person pits" in Guishan and Hongshan, more than 32,600 disaster-stricken people who starved to death or died of illness were buried. From this stark contrast between the two floods, it fully demonstrates the great power of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government; if there were no people's democratic system led by the working class, no high concern of the central government and Chairman Mao for the disaster-stricken people, and no united support of the people of the whole country, the disasters that the people of Hubei Province have encountered would be difficult to imagine.

Secondly, the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state, especially the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain policy, has created extremely favorable conditions for production and disaster relief. The people's government transported 20 billion jin of grain from Sichuan and 14 other provinces and our own non-disaster areas to supply the disaster-stricken people. Special ships were set up in disaster areas to transport grain, and during the flood season, grain was supplied wherever the disaster-stricken people went. During the heavy snow period, various places generally adopted measures such as cadres carrying grain to the countryside, delivering goods to the door, and rowing boats or carrying goods on the ice; in Hanchuan, Yunchang, and 13 other severely affected counties, more than 8.3 billion jin of grain was transported in one month. In Hanchuan County, an average of more than 200 people delivered grain to the countryside every day during the snow period. In Yingcheng County, 36 mobile supply teams were added in three districts. When the masses were besieged by heavy snow and ate cheap rice from Sichuan and Guangdong provinces transported by the government, they were moved to say, "The state's unified purchase and sale of grain policy is a lifesaving policy!" Due to the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain policy, the grain supply in the disaster areas was guaranteed to be sufficient, the prices in the disaster areas were stabilized, and the lives of the disaster-stricken people were guaranteed (the state sold grain in the disaster areas, with a total loss of 10.27 million yuan). According to the situation we saw in Fanhu Township, Wanchang District, Wuhan, every family eats white rice and dry rice, the garden is full of vegetables that cannot be eaten, pigs, cows, chickens, and dogs are complete, and men and women laborers all work in the fields, and there are no idle people in the family. If it were not for the fact that the houses were reduced in size and were relatively simple, it would be hard to see that this place had suffered a great flood disaster.

Thirdly, the vast number of district and township cadres and activists have always stood at the forefront of the struggle with their noble qualities of loving the people, being brave and calm, and striving hard, and their revolutionary heroism spirit, leading the masses and creating countless moving deeds. In the flood prevention and rescue struggle, they have sacrificed themselves to block the breaches, and have saved others at the cost of their lives. During the relocation of the disaster-stricken people, the grassroots cadres in the disaster areas ate, lived, and moved with the disaster-stricken people, carried things for the disaster-stricken people, found houses for the disaster-stricken people, and cooked tea and meals for the disaster-stricken people. Wherever the disaster-stricken people went, the cadres went, and they were responsible for taking them out and bringing them back, ensuring the safety of the disaster-stricken people during the relocation. During the cold wave and heavy snow period, many cadres worked day and night to visit and comfort the disaster-stricken people door to door, distribute relief grain, and distribute winter clothes. They also swept snow and repaired houses for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and the disabled, elderly, sick, and poor, so that they would not suffer from cold and hunger. Therefore, the masses reflected, "The cadres educated by Chairman Mao have truly done the job of delivering coal in the snow!" The vast number of district and township cadres shared the hardships and difficulties with the disaster-stricken people, united the masses, and formed a great force to overcome natural disasters.

Now, the people of Hubei Province are carrying out a new flood prevention struggle. Based on past experience and the prediction of hydrological and meteorological conditions, we are completely confident that with the wise leadership of the central government and Chairman Mao, as well as the support of the people of the whole country, and with the united efforts of the party, government, military, and people of the entire province, we will definitely defeat the floods this year, strive for a bumper harvest, complete the agricultural increase production plan, and support national industrialization and the liberation of Taiwan.

I fully support our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Our motherland has embarked on the bright and glorious path of socialism, and the dawn of socialist construction has illuminated every corner. Everything that benefits society, everything that benefits society in terms of scholarship, is now playing a role in promoting the peace and happiness of mankind. Traditional Chinese medicine, which has long been despised by the bourgeoisie, has also received the attention of the Communist Party and the people's government. Due to my long-term and continuous involvement in Chinese medicine, my long-term and continuous use of Chinese medicine to treat poor patients, and my long-term and continuous observation of the fact that Chinese medicine has been despised by the bourgeoisie, although my knowledge of medicine is shallow, although I have never been a professional doctor due to my shallow knowledge of medicine, although I am only a medical researcher, I am still excited and cannot suppress my own speech on the issue of Chinese medicine today.

The characteristics of Chinese medicine are not only that it has a history of thousands of years, not only that it has more than two thousand effective drugs, and not only that it has treatment methods such as acupuncture, massage, tuina, and daoyin; but also that as early as more than two thousand years ago, Chinese medicine was able to discover the health laws of human existence in nature and the causal relationship of harm to health. For example, the excessive cold or heat of temperature, the excessive high or low of air pressure, the excessive dry or wet of air, the excessive hunger or fullness of diet, the excessive more or less of excretion, the excessive stillness or activity of the body, the excessive busyness or idleness of the brain, the excessive long or short of sleep, the excessive bitterness or joy of emotions, can all, according to the different physiological and living conditions of each person, unknowingly affect health. Chinese medicine has long had a rich and correct explanation for the diseases caused by these causes; and it has also explained that these diseases occur first in the conscious ability of self-awareness and then gradually develop into objective quality changes. The problem that is particularly emphasized is the phenomenon of imbalance and imbalance in the increase and decrease of heat and the increase and decrease and imbalance of body fluids. Therefore, it has also affirmed the natural laws of the evolution and consequences of some diseases, and organized a series of symptom formulas as diagnostic and treatment standards; and then flexibly used various drugs or non-drug treatment methods to adjust the imbalance within the body, or restore the innate ability to resist disease. Because the view of health in Chinese medicine is rooted in the balance between various parts within the body and the unity of the body with the external world, the view of disease in Chinese medicine is rooted in the contradiction between the functions within the body and the contradiction between the body and the external world. Therefore, the law of treatment is to focus on how to restore balance and how to restore unity, and has never emphasized the treatment of all diseases, nor has it ever emphasized the treatment of certain symptoms. "Headache, treat the head; foot pain, treat the foot," these two ancient folk sayings that criticize doctors who cannot treat diseases are still circulating among the people. More than 30 different causes of headache symptoms in Chinese medicine have more than 30 different treatments. The key is that the pathology must be thorough and the diagnosis must be correct. Doctors who do not have a grasp of the diagnosis can only adopt the temporary treatment method of "headache, treat the head." For example, cassia is an effective medicine for cold headache, but if the diagnosis is wrong and used for summer headache, it will cause nosebleeds or cerebral hemorrhage and death. The reason is that there was originally a contradiction, and cassia further increased the contradiction. From the viewpoint of the occurrence of disease due to contradiction, it is discovered that there are still some diseases that do not need to use medical treatment, and it is possible to recover health naturally through rest or food. Various methods with medical effects, such as how to rest and how to eat, have also been richly explained in Chinese medical books. From the theoretical source, Chinese medicine is a medicine with the theory of balance and unity as its foundation, and it has also been proven by thousands of years of clinical experience. This should be regarded as the characteristic of Chinese medicine.

Whether in the work of organizing or researching Chinese medicine, if we deviate from this characteristic and only pay attention to the effect of certain drugs or certain technologies on certain cases, this is equivalent to abandoning the basic content of Chinese medicine, equivalent to cutting off the historical facts of Chinese medicine, equivalent to treating Chinese medicine as many fragmented and pieced-together things, equivalent to treating Chinese medicine with the viewpoint and method of studying physics and chemistry. Of course, such individual problems are also worth studying, but first of all, it should be noted that it should be carried out under the guidance of the characteristic of Chinese medicine itself. If this characteristic is ignored and only individual problems are paid attention to, it will be impossible to understand the overall situation and basic spirit of Chinese medicine, and it will not be easy to have great achievements in a short period of time. For example, the book "Compendium of Materia Medica" records 2,608 kinds of drugs. Assuming that the research work on the therapeutic effects of five kinds of drugs can be completed every year, it would take more than 500 years. Although it is possible to achieve some effective results in symptomatic treatment, the overall system and basic content of Chinese medicine will not be able to be communicated and connected. For example, the fact that bitter buckwheat seeds have a special effect on amoebic dysentery has been proven to be exactly the same as the Western medicine "Yatren." But in the history of Chinese medicine, the methods of treating dysentery have always been different according to various different causes and symptoms, using various different methods to enhance the anti-disease function of the intestine; and bitter buckwheat seeds in Chinese medicine have always been used to control certain endocrine functions that resist progression, but have never been used in the range of intestinal diseases. Again, for example, acupuncture treatment is only one of the many treatment methods in Chinese medicine, and it is not an omnipotent method for treating all diseases. Correct acupuncture treatment has a considerable effect, but if it is not through the correct diagnosis of Chinese medicine, or if acupuncture is misused, or if acupuncture should be used but acupuncture is misused, these adverse consequences are also considerable. The treatment of diseases, whether acupuncture should be used, whether drugs or other methods should be used, the problem must be decided according to the overall theoretical system of Chinese medicine, that is, it must be decided by correct diagnosis, and it is not a problem that patients can choose by themselves based on their own sensory perception. That is to say, if the physical and mechanical viewpoint is used to treat the lesion, it is to deviate from the overall system of pathology. In the treatment effect of Chinese medicine, the reason why the treatment of all diseases is sometimes not as effective for women as for men may be that the overall theoretical system of medicine is not fully prepared for the physiology and pathology of women. In the past feudal ruling period, Chinese women never had the opportunity to study medicine; the medical arguments created by experience have always been men, and the accumulated clinical experience has been mostly male cases. Therefore, the application of Chinese medicine sometimes cannot fully meet the law of evolution and treatment requirements of women's diseases. Therefore, the pathology and treatment methods of women should be studied and enriched on the basis of the original overall theoretical system. From these simple explanations, it can be seen that Chinese medicine in clinical application, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment are all holistic and comprehensive. From these simple explanations, it can also be seen that Chinese medicine in academic content includes physiology, pathology, diagnostics, therapeutics, pharmacology, health preservation, etc., and even therapeutics include acupuncture, massage, tuina, daoyin, etc., all of which are unified, interrelated, of the same theoretical origin, indivisible, and not isolated. The thousands of medical books accumulated by our ancestors over thousands of years, whether in theory or method, have all been continuously expanded and developed with the passage of time, but the entire content is a complete set, unified before and after, and connected between ancient and modern. Therefore, in the future, the work of organizing and researching Chinese medicine, regardless of any subject, should take into account the original integrity of the entire medicine. It cannot be denied that Chinese medicine also has its shortcomings, and we should eliminate the part that is mysterious and contrived, and sort out the part that is correct and real, so as to maintain the original basic characteristics of Chinese medicine, so as to bring into play the original experience and effectiveness of Chinese medicine, so as to plan teaching methods on this basis, compile textbooks for Chinese medicine, and establish schools for Chinese medicine. Furthermore, combined with modern natural sciences, gradually improve the dosage form and dosage of drugs, enrich the examination methods of diagnosis, etc. In short, all medical sciences produced by modern science should not only be fully absorbed but also play a role in weighing and correcting in the process of criticizing and sorting out Chinese medicine.

From classics to science, from broad to precise, this series of work on Chinese medicine, in other words, is from organization to improvement. This is precisely the universal demand of the country's Chinese doctors over the past few years, and it is also a great undertaking that the academic circle of China has never had before. The correct policy of the people's government towards Chinese medicine will mobilize all Chinese doctors to participate in this great undertaking. Each Chinese doctor will certainly feel unlimited excitement and unlimited glory. But the work is very meticulous, very complicated, and very difficult, especially the process of work from organization to improvement will inevitably encounter many difficulties in solving academic problems. Due to the limitations of the learning environment formed by Chinese doctors in the past, in the future, we must closely follow Western medicine based on science, learn more from Western medicine, and obtain more help from Western medicine to complete this glorious and arduous task, to create a unified medicine of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and to make Chinese medicine contribute more to mankind. Doctors and medical scientists who serve the health of mankind should not have any differences in identity and name; Chinese medicine and foreign medicine that serve the health of mankind should not have any differences in academic methods.

Since liberation, the development of national health undertakings has greatly improved the health level of the people. The people, due to the improvement of health knowledge, also have a more urgent and extensive demand for health than before. In order to meet the people's demand for health, in order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction, Chinese and Western medicine must unite under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, work closely together, and better serve the health of the people.

I wholeheartedly support the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan" and am willing to strive for the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of our country.

I studied mechanical engineering and was also engaged in the operation of capitalist machinery manufacturing industry. When I was young, I felt that without machinery, the country could not be strong. Later, I heard the saying "Industrial Salvation," and I also yearned for it. My study and engagement in mechanical engineering were not purely based on interest, but at that time, I did not understand the necessity of China following the inevitable laws of historical development and that China could not take the path of capitalist industrialization. For decades, my enterprise, under the dual oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, under the control of the blind operation law of capitalism, has always been in a difficult and miserable situation. My colleagues and I in the factory, although we also worked together to study technology, but in a situation where one difficulty followed another, by the eve of liberation, we were already on the verge of collapse, and the so-called "Industrial Salvation" was indeed a dream. This is also the common experience of the national bourgeoisie engaged in technological research in semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China. In the early days of liberation, most of our enterprises accepted state orders, and last year we were approved for joint state-private operation, improved production and operation, overcame difficulties, and played a positive role in the national economy and people's livelihood, which was very pleasant. Chairman Mao said:

"Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Today, the state wants to implement the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy on the basis of the recovery of the national economy, realizing the long-cherished wish of the people of the whole country. It also proves that only by taking the path of socialist industrialization can we turn impoverished China into a truly prosperous and strong China. In the face of such a great plan, our inner excitement is understandable.

Vice Premier Li pointed out in the report: "Socialist industrialization is the central task of our country in the transitional period, and the central link of socialist industrialization is the priority development of heavy industry." "The policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the only correct policy for the prosperity and happiness of the state and the people." Moreover, the completion of the industrial production plan in the next five years will also largely depend on the original enterprises. Therefore, the task undertaken by those engaged in the construction of heavy industry in the first Five-Year Plan is arduous and glorious. Therefore, it is necessary to attach importance to the production work of the original enterprises, give full play to their potential, and strive to overfulfill the production plan. In view of the current widespread phenomena of few product varieties, low quality, and high cost, it is necessary to vigorously improve technology in enterprises, improve product quality, eliminate defective products, trial-produce new products. There is a key problem that must be solved first, which is the problem of product specifications and standards, because the poor quality of heavy industry products can hinder all industrial products. If the strict specifications and standards are not followed, but the cost is arbitrarily reduced, it is close to cutting corners, and if the specifications and standards are not followed but only the production is increased, it is equivalent to manufacturing defective products, which is unthinkable. It is necessary to formulate specifications under the premise of encouraging the advanced, considering the majority, and promoting the backward, and it must be formulated under the condition that it can adapt to the current possible conditions in our country, with a minimum standard and a maximum standard. Products that do not meet the minimum standard should be treated as defective products and not used; while the maximum standard should be the target for everyone to strive for together. Only the maximum standard, without the minimum standard, will have difficulties in the mother machine problem, technical problem, and raw material problem, making it impossible to reach, and there is no way to start; only the minimum standard will make everyone satisfied with the existing achievements, stagnate, and never progress. Therefore, the minimum standard should be realistic, gradually improved, and improved step by step to improve the quality, which is in line with reality.

The machinery manufacturing industry is the leading force in the technological transformation of the national economy. The dimensions of machinery products must be accurate, the materials must be excellent, and the names must be unified. Therefore, it is necessary to establish standard measuring instrument inspection stations in areas with many machinery factories to calibrate precise dimensions; establish special steel mills to produce suitable steel materials, and define the national unified names of various machines and parts.

Representatives, we now have the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the selfless help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Our era is very great, and the tasks we undertake in the Five-Year Plan are very arduous and glorious. We should all be very happy and sincere to unite, overcome difficulties, increase production, and contribute to the completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

In addition, during the meeting, I listened to the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of water resources, and I know that the problem of the Yellow River, which has not been treated by our country for thousands of years, has been planned to be able to see the Yellow River water clear in five years, and in a few decades, it can be fundamentally treated. This will achieve unprecedented great achievements in large-scale transportation, extensive irrigation, and huge power generation. Such great news is coming one after another, and today, as a citizen of the People's Republic of China in the era of Mao Zedong, why not progress with the country? Every Chinese must practice economy, save every possible penny to support the country's great plan. Especially, we should enhance our vigilance and eliminate the counter-revolutionary spies who are plotting to sabotage our construction!

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

These reports have been studied by our various small groups, and especially the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan" and the relevant documents have been studied more deeply. During the discussion, we also invited relevant government departments to explain or answer some questions. I have a deep understanding that the First Five-Year Plan is very scientific in terms of the proportion of light industry and heavy industry, the coordination of industry, agriculture, education, culture, transportation, and various constructions, the distribution of industrial regions, and the arrangement of large and medium-sized enterprises, and it is of great scale and in line with the general task of the state in the transitional period as stipulated in the Constitution. I also saw the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, knowing that the 1954 budget was executed very well, and the 1955 budget was also compiled in line with the First Five-Year Plan. As for the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of water resources, it made me understand that this plan, when implemented, will not only treat the Yellow River, which has plagued the Chinese people for thousands of years, but will also make it a river that benefits the people. This is a great construction that is rarely seen in the world. All of these have made me feel that the beauty of socialism is very obvious in front of my eyes. The people of the whole country should enhance their vigilance, eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, practice economy, oppose waste, and strive for the completion of the socialist construction of the country.

The First Five-Year Plan points out: "The unification of national weights and measures; the establishment of a system for the periodic calibration of measuring instruments and a unified product inspection system" is one of the necessary measures for the realization of the industrial production plan. This is closely related to my recent work assigned in the state agency - the Bureau of Weights and Measures. I would like to talk about this matter. The Bureau of Weights and Measures was established in May of this year, and it has only been two months. It is an expansion of the Weights and Measures Office of the Central Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Its guiding principles and tasks are currently being studied and discussed and awaiting approval, but it is certain that it will learn from the Soviet Union. Here are some points from the book "State Measurement Work in the Soviet Union" by Leonov and Katzman for reference:

"Any work, whether in factories, scientific research, collective farms, enterprise departments, agencies, or other organizations, requires the use of measuring instruments. It can ensure the correct organization and execution of each production process, ensure the quality of enterprise products, the interchangeability of parts, and the implementation of the assembly line production method. In national defense, it can ensure that weapons do not malfunction, and the correct matching of parts and ammunition are directly related to the manufacture and repair of measuring instruments used. It also has a great impact on economic accounting and product calculation. In short, people's daily lives cannot do without measuring instruments, such as time-measuring clocks, measuring instruments and weighing instruments for purchasing goods, measuring instruments for calculating gas and electricity, medical instruments, and transportation, telecommunications, etc.

"Incorrect measuring instruments and measuring methods will bring losses to the state, such as causing defective products, wasting raw materials, complicating machine repairs, and increasing repair costs, and even causing major accidents.

"To achieve the above purposes, it is necessary to establish scientific research institutions for measurement, build various measurement units of base instruments, formulate various measurement methods, and implement the national testing of measuring instruments; at the same time, establish measurement technical operation agencies, and carry out systematic inspection and supervision work."

From the above article introducing the situation in the Soviet Union, we can know that the work of the Bureau of Weights and Measures is not only to manage the commonly used rulers, scales, and weights, but also to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and correct use of all measuring instruments and meters, so as to achieve "ensuring product quality, interchangeability of parts, and implementing the assembly line production method." Therefore, this work is closely related to socialist industrialization.

The weights and measures system of our country is extremely chaotic, and the unification of weights and measures is indeed an urgent matter, and before this problem is solved, it is necessary to decide on the issue of which system to unify. Before the establishment of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, the Central Bureau of Industry and Commerce had convened meetings of relevant departments many times, and all agreed to adopt the international metric system (i.e., the meter-kilogram system) as the system to unify the weights and measures of our country, abolish the market units of shi, jin, and sheng, and local old and mixed systems, because the international metric system is the most scientific system, and all countries in the world, including the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, have adopted it. Our country has also adopted it unofficially, and it is very suitable to unify the weights and measures system of our country with the metric system. However, the Chinese names of the units of the metric system, which were defined by the reactionary government of the Kuomintang, are extremely unscientific and should be changed. Currently, the Bureau of Weights and Measures is working with relevant agencies and organizations to discuss the naming method of the metric system and will first submit it for approval and publication by higher authorities, and then draft specific measures for the unification of weights and measures throughout the country, and implement them after approval. At the same time, to improve and unify the inspection work of measuring instruments and meters (currently, there are 230 cities in the country with established weights and measures inspection stations or stations, and the inspection scope has already included: length, weighing instruments, measuring instruments, mechanics, thermodynamics, etc.) to meet the urgent needs of the people, the establishment of national standard instruments and local standard instruments has also become an issue that needs to be considered immediately.

In a country with a population of 600 million, the unification of weights and measures and the implementation of the national inspection of precision measuring instruments is a relatively complex and arduous task. Our organization has not been established for long, and I myself have little experience in this work, and I feel that the responsibility is heavy. But I will, under the leadership of higher authorities, learn from the Soviet Union and do as we learn, so that the measurement work of the state can be put on track as soon as possible to meet the requirements of the socialist industrialization of the state. I hope that the relevant departments and organizations of the government and the representatives of the National People's Congress will assist us in various aspects.

The second session of the First National People's Congress has seriously deliberated on the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of our country and the 1954 national financial settlement and the 1955 budget, and heard the report by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, who is also the Minister of National Defense, on the draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China, and the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River and the development of water resources. The achievements reflected in these plans and reports and the tasks proposed are unprecedented in Chinese history and are extremely important events in the modern life of the Chinese people. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the entire discussion and study of this conference due to my attendance at the World Mother Congress in Lausanne, which is a great loss for me as an individual. However, this has not lessened my excitement at the great themes that have been stirred up. Therefore, after the World Mother Congress ended, I hurried back to participate in the discussion of this topic with great historical significance. I eagerly hope for the thorough implementation of these great plans, which are of great significance for improving the material and cultural living standards of the people of the whole country and safeguarding world peace. I believe that the first Five-Year Plan of our country is to make our country successfully advance to the first step of socialist society. And the goals pursued in the first Five-Year Plan are no longer some unattainable ideals, but urgent tasks in the practice of construction in front of us. I believe that this plan is not an illusion, but a feasible one. It is in line with the needs of the people of the whole country today. I personally wholeheartedly agree with this plan and am willing to strive for its realization.

In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, and the Chinese revolution entered a new historical period, that is, the transitional period of building a socialist state in our country. In the three years since the founding of the country, through great efforts, our economy has recovered to the pre-war level, and many productions have exceeded the pre-war level. The people's democratic regime has been further consolidated, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has achieved great victories, land reform has been successfully completed, prices have been stabilized, and these have prepared for large-scale economic construction. Since 1953, the first Five-Year Plan to change the face of the state has been carried out, and the first session of the First National People's Congress was held in 1954 to announce the Constitution of our country. These all fully demonstrate the victorious progress of our country in various aspects of work, and the people of the whole country are cheering and celebrating the achievements of the past few years. At the same time, they are also working selflessly with full confidence to build a socialist republic. These achievements are obtained because the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao is correct.

However, past international and domestic experiences have also told us that imperialists and domestic reactionary forces will never willingly see the Chinese people living in peace and happiness. In addition to open armed attacks, they will also use various despicable spy tactics to sabotage from all sides. The facts of Pan Hannian and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have proven this point. It also shows that with the development of socialist construction, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution will also become more acute and complex. They have those with guns and those without guns, those who are open and those who are secret. As long as they can think of it, they will do it, because they hate the Chinese people. They have various counter-revolutionary programs and also use various different faces and methods. They disguise themselves as progressives but secretly "sharpen their swords" and "spy on the direction." If we do not eliminate these counter-revolutionaries hidden within the people, the people's democratic dictatorship will not be consolidated, and state construction will be sabotaged. I fully support the government's measures to arrest Pan Hannian and Hu Feng and request that they be tried and punished according to law.

In order to cooperate with national economic construction, the Ministry of Health convened the Industrial Health Conference in May last year to discuss the improvement of industrial health work. The Ministry of Health, in cooperation with relevant departments, strengthened business leadership, sent a batch of health cadres to factories and mines to strengthen the medical and preventive forces of factories and mines, and took corresponding measures for the most harmful and occupational diseases that endanger workers, according to different situations, from urgent to non-urgent. For example, measures have been taken for the prevention of high temperatures, dust, harmful gases, as well as common diseases such as stomach and intestinal diseases and women's diseases. In rural areas, how to face agricultural production, how to further carry out the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign, prevent and treat infectious diseases, and how to carry out medical and health care work in agricultural production cooperatives, various places in the country have accumulated a lot of experience, and we are further studying it. In the summer of last year, the long-term heavy rains in the Yangtze River basin caused the Ministry of Health to organize a large number of medical personnel to work in the disaster areas. Only in Hubei and Anhui provinces, more than 20,000 medical personnel were organized and a large number of medicines were allocated to fight against the spread of diseases.

In the past, the Central Health Department had serious shortcomings and errors in many aspects of work, and the issue of traditional Chinese medicine is a prominent example. China currently has about tens of thousands of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, which is a huge force in the health team and is a very important issue related to the health of 600 million people. Traditional Chinese medicine has good curative effects on many diseases. Over thousands of years, we have accumulated a lot of experience in treating diseases, but some responsible people in the health department consider traditional Chinese medicine to be "unscientific" and implement policies of exclusion and discrimination against traditional Chinese medicine, which is contrary to the policy of the Communist Party of China towards traditional Chinese medicine. In the past, the Central Health Department had wrongly formulated many regulations and measures, such as the "Provisional Regulations for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners," "Examination Methods for Doctors, Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners, Dentists, and Pharmacists," and "Regulations for Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Study Schools and Advanced Study Classes," which, through these laws and regulations, restricted the reasonable position of traditional Chinese medicine. The so-called advanced study is mainly the courses of Western medicine, and the examination is also the questions of Western medicine, so most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners naturally have little hope of having a future. These errors are a reflection of the despicable bourgeois ideology in the health department. As pointed out by Comrade Lin Feng in his speech at this conference about the health department, "The most serious thing is that after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao repeatedly pointed out this policy error, they still did not fundamentally change it in their actual work. The recent National Conference on Education and Culture has seriously criticized this erroneous ideology, which is completely necessary." We will definitely continue to fight against this erroneous ideology in the future to ensure that we turn this erroneous viewpoint around and strive to promote the precious medical heritage of our motherland.

Due to the existence of many fundamental errors and shortcomings, the work of the health department has lagged behind other departments. The main reason for these errors is that some leaders of the health department have not seriously studied and implemented the policies and guidelines of the party and the government, lack politics, and are self-righteous, not respecting the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and thus cannot provide serious political and business leadership, lack political education for medical personnel, and cannot improve their view of serving the people, resulting in frequent medical accidents in various medical institutions, as well as chaotic and wasteful phenomena in medical work. The phenomenon of waste and accumulation of materials is also very serious. Many standards set for basic construction are too high. These are all inevitable evils caused by the lack of politics. The experience of several years has proven that health work can only be correctly developed under the leadership of the party and the government. Otherwise, serious errors will be made. Comrade Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee, pointed out in her speech that some medical personnel have poor service attitudes, which is true, and this also reflects that our political leadership is poor, and we have the responsibility to solve this problem from the root.

The task required of health work in the Five-Year Plan is very arduous. We will definitely complete it well. At the National Conference on Education and Culture in June this year, the focus was on discussing the policy issues of health work in the future. In addition to striving to correct past errors, what we need more is to strive to improve various specific measures for health work, improve leadership levels, be vigilant against the infiltration and sabotage of bourgeois ideology at all times, improve the work of traditional Chinese medicine, establish higher medical education, improve the management of industrial hygiene, pay attention to rural health work, and strictly manage infectious diseases that are more harmful to people's health. Regarding the prevention and treatment work of schistosomiasis prevalent in the Yangtze River area, we have recently drafted the principles and methods for the prevention and treatment work in the future, deciding to adopt the principle of unified leadership by the party and the government to mobilize the masses, control the development, and eliminate it within a limited period in the epidemic areas. This work must be carried out by combining prevention with treatment; scientific research should be strengthened, the experience of traditional Chinese medicine should be absorbed, and the application should be promoted. The elimination of schistosomiasis is a long-term and complex work. We require various relevant departments to cooperate and assist.

This year is the third year of the first Five-Year Plan, which is a decisive year. In the future, we must forge ahead, and the most important thing is to educate our medical personnel, scientists, and a large number of health cadres to study Marxism-Leninism well, overcome bourgeois ideology, improve their ideological level, strengthen political and business leadership, sincerely and sincerely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, strengthen the cultivation of cadres, strengthen scientific research, carry forward the medical heritage of our motherland, improve the quality of medical technology, and wholeheartedly serve socialist construction. Finally, I should also say: the team of the health department is very complex, and it is necessary to seriously rectify our own team, eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, practice strict economy, work diligently, overcome all difficulties, and strive for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

Title: Speech by Hu Yaobang at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress

I fully support the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The great Communist Party of China, with its great wisdom, has designed a blueprint for the foundation of a socialist building for the people of our country. Now, we are all concerned about the construction force of this building foundation. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." Starting from this point, I request the conference to pay attention to the young generation of our people.

Our country now has 186 million young people, of whom 100 million are already working on various fronts of the motherland, and the remaining 86 million are mostly studying, or they are actively preparing to work for the motherland. If we can better cultivate this new force and connect this force with the strength of the whole people, our every undertaking will have the most reliable guarantee.

Young people always link their lofty ideals with the destiny of the motherland. When old China was in days of suffering, Chinese youth had already closely followed the party to join the struggle to liberate the motherland; now, the bright future of New China is clearly before us, Chinese youth will certainly follow the party more bravely to fight and launch a wave of building the motherland.

I should say it more precisely. Young people will launch a higher wave of building the motherland. Because in the past two and a half years, the vast number of young people have launched such a wave. For example, our party called for factories and mines to launch labor competitions and overfulfill state plans, and the vast number of young workers enthusiastically responded to this call, and many advanced producers and model workers emerged. For example, our party called for construction projects to be done well, quickly, and economically, and many young workers on construction sites organized youth shock brigades, raising the work quota to two to six times. For example, our party called for farmers to organize and take the path of cooperation, and young farmers became an active force in this movement. Just taking the young league members, 600,000 have joined mutual aid groups, and 150,000 have joined cooperatives, of which 130,000 are backbone members of cooperative mutual aid groups. That is to say, 90% of young league members in rural areas are at the forefront of this movement. For example, our party called for the planting of oil crops, and young people enthusiastically responded to this call. Just the young people in the capital planted more than a million sunflowers in vacant lots. For example, our party recently called for the people of the whole country to practice all-around economy and strive for socialist construction, and many places organized youth economy brigades. Just in Anshan alone, the youth economy brigades have picked up 500,000 tons of scrap steel and iron in more than two months. Our party recently also called for the people to strive to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and the vast number of young people bravely joined this battle. I believe that in this struggle, Chinese youth will not fall behind. All of these show that Chinese youth completely trust the party's leadership and are loyal to the people's cause. As long as we skillfully use various organizational forms and activities to bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of young people, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people to build socialism will be even higher.

But this does not mean that the young people of New China are already perfect. No, young people have weaknesses, that is, they lack experience and knowledge. Because young people lack experience, those forces that will struggle to the death, that is, those hidden counter-revolutionaries, those exploiters who do not want to do people over again, and those who resolutely resist socialist transformation, will disguise themselves as "good friends" of young people, especially disguise themselves as "good friends" of intellectual youth, and use thousands of deception methods to poison them in their thoughts and spread idealism, individualism, and liberalism among them, in a word, try to make them deviate from the revolution and destroy themselves. Because young people lack knowledge, they do work, their business ability is poor, they do production, their technical level is low. We hope that all levels of state workers, and everyone who loves the future of socialism, will all pay more attention to the young and adolescent people of our country, pay attention to the growth of their communist thoughts, qualities, and morals, pay attention to the strengthening of their physique, pay attention to their learning of cultural and scientific knowledge, especially pay attention to the learning of cultural and scientific knowledge in their spare time for the vast majority of working and peasant youth. We hope that everyone will give great help and support to all the activities carried out by the Communist Youth League in this regard.

When it comes to caring for young people, we who work with young people have a special responsibility. Do what you do, love what you do, this is our revolutionary sense of responsibility. In recent years, due to the leadership and supervision of the party, although we have done some work, it is still not enough. One of the main reasons why it is not enough is that there is still a tendency of empty talk and impracticality in our work. Not conducting practical investigations and research on the problems of young people, not seriously organizing the execution and inspection of actual work, not conducting specific education and organizational work towards the broad masses of young people, using empty arguments to drown out those real "small things," is the most dangerous harm in the work of the Communist Youth League. We hope that revolutionary predecessors will strictly supervise us to improve our ideological style and work style. We believe that it is beneficial and harmless to have higher requirements for young cadres. Steel is tempered at high temperatures, not softened by "warmth." We believe that every person who is determined to temper himself into a cadre loyal to the people will welcome strict requirements for himself.

The youth of the whole country enthusiastically supports the great plan to treat and develop the Yellow River. Our country will use a dozen years to turn the Yellow River, which our ancestors could not tame for thousands of years, into a clean river that serves the people. This fact will certainly inspire young people to bravely participate in this struggle. Our way of participating in this struggle is: first, to bring into play the shock effect of young people on all construction sites; second, to mobilize young people to take the lead in migrating in water conservancy construction areas; third, to mobilize the planting of trees and forests among young people nationwide, especially among young people in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces, and to actively participate in the work of water and soil conservation. We plan to launch a long-term tree planting and afforestation movement among young people nationwide. We calculate that if each person plants one tree alive per year, with an average of 120 trees per acre, the young people of the whole country can afforest 1.55 million acres per year, and if each tree is valued at 5 yuan after growth, the young people of the whole country can create a huge wealth of 930 million yuan for the motherland every year.

Great victories must be achieved through arduous struggles. The youth of New China will certainly respond to the call to practice economy and oppose waste, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bravely overcoming all difficulties of the revolutionary predecessors. Now some people, on the pretext of food shortage, advocate delaying the speed of national socialist industrialization. Delaying industrialization is to allow capitalist forces to exist for a long time, to allow the vast majority of farmers and other small producers to remain in poverty and suffering for a long time, and to make the body of the motherland suffer from chronic backwardness. We oppose this erroneous proposal. In order to accelerate the improvement of our country's grain production, I fully agree with the proposal by Vice Premier Li to use part of the funds to open up wasteland. Large-scale reclamation is certainly a very arduous and complex work. But when we think of our predecessors who shed blood and sacrificed their lives, struggled for more than a hundred years, especially when we think of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people to fight bravely and sacrifice their lives for twenty-eight years, and build a new China, and think of the land we have now is all reclaimed by the labor of our ancestors, and think of we can build a socialist country in just a dozen years, we are full of confidence in this matter. The youth of New China will also assist the party and the government in this arduous task and become a brave vanguard.

Since the young people of New China love their great motherland and the bright future of socialism, they naturally have a special understanding of their solemn responsibility in the country's implementation of the compulsory military service system. Last year, during the trial conscription of compulsory military service, more than 10.3 million young people reported for conscription in a few months, and nearly 400,000 young league members reported, that is to say, almost all young league members of conscription age in rural areas reported. Young people enthusiastically support the military service law because they think it is another good opportunity to serve the motherland. Young people enthusiastically support the military service law, and also because they have a deep affection for the People's Liberation Army, saying, "A few years in the army, both literary and martial arts are proficient." Undoubtedly, the promulgation of the military service law will arouse higher patriotic enthusiasm among Chinese youth to defend the security of the motherland. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai mentioned in his report that our people have never had and will never have the idea of invading other countries, but our people will definitely liberate their own territory of Taiwan. Chinese youth will definitely be able to bear the responsibility in this sacred task. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai also said that we love peace, but if imperialism dares to bring the disaster of war to our people, invade our territory and sovereignty, we will not be afraid of war. On this point, Chinese youth will give a resounding answer: if the war merchants dare to have this unlucky idea, the motherland needs as many soldiers as we have.

Representatives, our motherland is advancing towards the road of prosperity and strength. The great power of the people of our country will definitely realize their great plan. Young people say: "Advancing with the motherland is happiness." As a young worker, I will devote my strength to this unprecedented happiness.

I fully agree with and support the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on "The Development of the National Economy in the First Five-Year Plan" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The First Five-Year Plan emphasizes the development of heavy industry first, which is completely in line with the needs of socialist industrialization in our country and the long-term interests of the people. While developing heavy industry, we should also develop light industry accordingly to meet the needs of people's lives and accumulate construction funds for the state. The textile industry has a heavy responsibility in this regard. But the current spinning spindles and raw materials of the textile industry are not enough to solve various textile products for military, civilian, industrial, and transportation use. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that on the basis of restoring and developing silk, wool, and hemp production, man-made fiber industry will be established and hemp spinning industry will be developed, which is very correct. Now, I would like to offer some immature opinions on the development of man-made fiber and hemp spinning industry for reference.

I think that to develop the man-made fiber industry, we must correspondingly develop the pulp industry it needs; to develop the hemp spinning industry, we must correspondingly expand the hemp planting area.

The raw materials used by various countries in the world to manufacture artificial silk are mostly wood pulp. But wood is the material most needed for industrial construction in our country, so we should consider using other materials to replace and save wood pulp. According to experience, we can consider using cotton pulp or mixing cotton pulp. Our country still has a large amount of short lint on cotton seeds and waste cotton flowers from cotton mills, and we should use them to manufacture cotton pulp. In addition, such as sugarcane residue, cotton stalk skin, sorghum stalk, etc., we should also try to use them one by one. In Shanghai, the Anle Artificial Silk Factory has begun small-scale trials on cotton stalk skin, proving that it can manufacture artificial silk and artificial fibers.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a highly scientific document and is our goal of struggle under the guidance of the general line for the whole nation. It declares to the world: the six hundred million people of all China have advanced in big strides on the road to building socialism! I wholeheartedly support the entire content of this plan and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun!

Recently, I visited the Northeast with twenty-seven academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We saw many newly built, expanded, and reconstructed large-scale projects under construction, and many completed enterprises developing vigorously. These are the fruits of the hard work of worker comrades day and night under the guidance of Soviet experts, which has greatly educated us and also made us very excited. It is as if we have seen our socialist society, which has given us a deeper understanding and stronger confidence in the socialist industrialization of our country; that is, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the great Soviet government and people, and through the hard work of the people of the whole country, we will definitely complete and even overfulfill this first great Five-Year Plan!

Our Five-Year Plan is completely in line with the basic economic law of socialism. The great Stalin defined this economic law as follows: to use methods that continuously increase and perfect socialist production on a high technological basis to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society. In our plan, the needs of the whole society in all aspects have been set to increase year by year. Therefore, in terms of production and circulation in industry, agriculture, transportation, postal services, commerce, and other aspects, the quantity and quality have also been set to increase year by year, and the guarantee is the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the continuous reduction of production costs in each enterprise. How can we continuously improve labor productivity and continuously reduce costs? According to the above definition, it is to do so on a high technological basis. Here, I think the word "high" refers to the speed of improvement, not the absolute level. As long as our technological basis is continuously improved and there is no stagnation or regression, no matter how weak our original technological basis is, our technology can be explained as high. This guarantee of a high technological basis has been fully demonstrated in our Five-Year Plan. This is: the continuous exploration of our vast natural resources, the continuous mechanization of various enterprises, and the continuous and vigorous cultivation and development of construction cadres and scientific research work. Therefore, our Five-Year Plan is completely in line with the basic economic law of socialism. The superiority of socialism in our China has been fully proven by ironclad facts, and therefore, our Five-Year Plan is definitely achievable and even overfulfillable.

Now I would like to offer a few suggestions on the technological foundation of our country. To cultivate construction cadres and technical workers, we should vigorously develop adult education, especially correspondence education, which has been specially emphasized in the plan draft and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun. Cadres and workers are different from young students. They not only have stronger political tempering but also have a certain amount of business knowledge and experience. Their education should not adopt the procedures and methods of general professional schools, just as teaching adults to read is different from teaching children to read, because so-called illiterates often only lack the ability to read characters, not the ability to understand texts. Therefore, the adult education of cadres and workers should be closely linked to work tasks, starting from learning the technical theory of business and gradually deepening into basic natural sciences. For example, a lathe worker who has mastered cutting technology should learn the structural principles of the lathe immediately after learning the structure of the lathe, and then learn mathematics and physics related to these principles. From sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, from knowing "how" to knowing "why." They should learn natural sciences not detached from their current work but start from scratch with mathematics and physics. This is the traditional educational method of general schools for young students, which is not suitable for cadres and workers. First, learn business technology, then learn professional theory, and finally learn basic sciences. I think this is completely possible. Here, we should also vigorously develop national scientific and technological popularization work as a powerful assistant for adult education, which has achieved extremely great success in the Soviet Union.

The importance of scientific research work has been clearly stated in the plan draft and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun. The cultivation of cadres is already a slow process, and the development of scientific research requires even more time, because the improvement of science is based on the popularization of science. However, the Five-Year Plan has urgent requirements for scientific research, just as it does for the cultivation of cadres, and we must take appropriate measures to eliminate this contradiction. (1) Fully utilize the human and material resources in existing scientific research institutions, avoid duplication and waste, strengthen weak links, and establish an economic accounting mindset among research personnel. (2) Firmly establish the system of scientific research serving production, determine the service objects of each research institution, strengthen the coordination and cooperation between various research institutions, and make the coordination and cooperation of research work adapt to the coordination and cooperation of enterprise production, and strive together to improve labor productivity and reduce costs. (3) Open the doors of scientific research institutions to enterprise innovators, allowing them to complete their technological innovations in a scientific research environment. (4) Make the research work of higher education institutions serve production and construction through teaching. (5) Expand the academic activities of various professional associations in natural sciences to complement the research work in production, and make the work of these associations play a bridging role in production, education, and research. (6) Connect the inventions and rationalization proposals of enterprises with relevant scientific research work, forming many specialized scientific work networks, and then organizing these networks into a national scientific research network. We should expand scientific research work to the scale of the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign to ensure the technological health of all enterprises in the Five-Year Plan.

The task of all scientific and technological personnel in the Five-Year Plan is very arduous. In addition to strengthening our work at each post to improve our technological foundation, we should vigorously support the work of liberating Taiwan, restoring our territorial sovereignty, expanding the natural resources and technological foundation of our economic construction, and participating in the work of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries. Through the victory of class struggle, we will safeguard the achievements of the Five-Year Plan. Let all scientific and technological workers, closely united around the Communist Party of China, accelerate the completion of several Five-Year Plans one by one, and strive to build our motherland into a great socialist country!

Title: Expanding the Cultivation of Hemp and Utilizing Natural Resources to Increase Textile Raw Materials
Author:
Date: 1955-07-19
Page: 1

Expanding the cultivation of hemp and utilizing natural resources is an effective way to increase raw materials for the textile industry. China's climate and soil are suitable for the growth of various types of hemp. For example, in Northeast China, there is flax; in Northwest China, there is hemp; throughout the country, there is cannabis; along the rivers and coastal areas, there is ramie; and in the deserts of Northwest China and Inner Mongolia, there is wild hemp. The cultivation of ramie and wild hemp does not occupy the main arable land, and it does not significantly interfere with grain production. At the same time, the yield of hemp is very high. For example, the average yield of ramie per mu is about 140 jin, and after removing the impurities, about 90 jin of pure fiber remains, which is twice the yield of cotton per mu. Ramie is one of the earliest clothing materials in ancient China. The world-renowned Chinese summer cloth is made from ramie. Ramie fiber has a very strong tensile strength, about five to six times that of cotton, and it also has moisture resistance. It is very suitable for making industrial fabrics, ropes, and belts for ships and airplanes. As for wild hemp, its yield is also very high. It is estimated that about one million dan of wild hemp is produced annually. Its fiber is finer than that of ramie, and its tensile strength is similar to that of ramie. It can be used to replace high-quality wool and supplement the shortage of cotton. In addition, cannabis can also be used as a textile raw material.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, we have conducted a series of experimental work on utilizing various types of hemp as textile raw materials. By utilizing existing equipment and continuously experimenting, we have overcome most of the difficulties and achieved initial success. We have already used bleached ramie long fibers on silk, wool, or hemp spinning machines to spin pure hemp yarn, hemp-wool blended yarn, hemp-silk blended yarn, and various cotton-wool-silk-hemp blended and interwoven products. We have also spun pure hemp yarn on flax spinning machines. Last year, Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Mill began trial spinning of cotton-hemp blended yarn on cotton spinning machines. This year, in May, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we installed a set of small machines in the processing of ramie, using pulp beating machines and bleaching tanks used in papermaking, and after absorbing the suggestions of workers, we made multiple improvements to meet the expected requirements. We then mixed 75% cotton and 25% ramie fiber to trial spin 32-count blended yarn, which was initially successful, and weaved over 2,000 pieces of cloth, with the quality similar to pure cotton cloth. For example, Shanghai No. 2 and No. 3 Wool Mills also produced wild hemp-wool blended fabrics such as Huada cloth and women's cloth last year. They also produced silk-hemp blended fabrics. In 1953, Harbin Hemp Factory also trial-spun hemp yarn and wove hemp and flax, and hemp and cotton interwoven fabrics, with the quality similar to flax fabrics.

The above examples show that it is possible to expand the spinning of ramie and utilize other types of hemp as textile raw materials by using China's existing cotton, wool, and flax spinning machines.

The utilization of various types of hemp, especially ramie, for spinning has the advantages of easy sweat absorption, heat dissipation, moisture resistance, and bright coloring. In particular, in the hot summer, wearing such fabrics is cool and comfortable. Pure hemp cloth is durable and long-lasting. However, the fibers of hemp are relatively smooth and have poor cohesion, which still poses some difficulties in the spinning process. We believe that through continuous research and development, we will gradually overcome these difficulties. In addition, the cost of ramie is still high, mainly due to the high cost of manual peeling of the hemp skin, which affects the price of raw hemp. In the future, when expanding the cultivation of hemp, we can try using hemp peeling machines to reduce the cost of raw hemp. At the same time, we should also strive to reduce the cost of production.

To increase textile raw materials and promote the development of China's textile industry, we must meet the needs of people's lives and strive to export hemp products to earn foreign exchange. In addition to continuing to experiment and research on artificial silk, artificial fibers, and various types of hemp, we propose the following suggestions: 1. In areas suitable for the cultivation of ramie, such as Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Jiangxi, we should appropriately promote the cultivation of ramie without affecting the main crops; 2. In areas where the soil has a light alkali content, the climate is relatively cold, there is a lot of wind, droughts are common, and other crops are not suitable for cultivation, we should encourage farmers to trial-plant wild hemp; 3. We hope that relevant departments will help us conduct trial production of pulp used in the manufacture of artificial fibers.

In implementing the first Five-Year Plan, we must fully utilize and develop China's scientific and technological forces. I am a technical worker and I am willing to follow the national technical workers, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to work hard, study diligently, and contribute everything I have to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan!

Title: Speech by Representative Pei Akei
Author:
Date: 1955-07-19
Page: 1

I am honored to attend the Second Session of the First National People's Congress and have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the first Five-Year Plan. I am very excited. I believe that this plan is a plan to develop the national economy, consolidate national defense, and improve people's lives. It is a plan for the happiness of all ethnic groups. I fully support it. Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget is also in line with this great plan and ensures its implementation. I fully agree.

The first Five-Year Plan is centered on the rapid development of heavy industry. The state's priority development of heavy industry is like raising mother pigs and chickens at home. With mother pigs and chickens, many piglets and chicks can be born; with heavy industry, various machines can be produced. Only in this way can our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation industry develop rapidly. Only in this way can our motherland become rich and strong, and socialism be realized.

We enthusiastically support the state's first Five-Year Plan because after its successful completion, the state will have a more powerful force to defend national defense, and with greater strength to support the development of ethnic minorities. Everyone knows that our Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southwestern border, with vast land and sparse population. Various ethnic groups live between steep cliffs. Due to long-term oppression by imperialism and domestic reactionary ruling classes, our backwardness and poverty were caused. Slash-and-burn agriculture was practiced, and even stone blocks and wooden sticks were used as farming tools. People were not well-fed or warmly clothed, using tree bark and grass roots as food, and using hemp cloth and tree leaves as clothing. There was not a single good day. After liberation, the light of the Communist Party shone upon the Nujiang Valley, and the warmth of Chairman Mao's kindness covered the Bili Snow Mountain. Like withered grass and trees in winter, it was only with great difficulty that they survived to see spring and bloom. The various ethnic groups of Nujiang have seen their lives improve day by day. We have implemented ethnic regional autonomy, and the autonomous organs have built brick and tile buildings, lit electric lights, and installed telephone lines in various counties. Mobile film teams have gone everywhere to show films, and health stations have provided free medical treatment to various ethnic groups. The autonomous region has built several post roads, and neither snow nor wild beasts can block the way. Industrial products have flowed in, and local products have been sold out. In production, the government has issued many loans and free farming tools. With the help of advanced ethnic groups, we have learned many technologies, and production has developed. Various ethnic groups, facing these new scenes, have looked and thought, thinking that this is unprecedented and even unimaginable happiness. However, just like climbing mountains and crossing ridges, the higher the mountain, the more difficult it is. After discussing the Five-Year Plan, I have seen a more beautiful future. Everyone has heard Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan to control Yellow River water disasters and develop Yellow River water resources, right? In the face of our great power, there is no enemy that cannot be defeated, whether it is imperialist invaders or natural disasters. We can proudly tell the world: the Yellow River's thousands of years of disasters will be eliminated, and the Yellow River's unlimited resources will be developed. The Yellow River plan is the beginning of our great motherland's large-scale conquest and utilization of nature, and it is a picture of the beautiful future of socialism. Isn't the Yangtze River also to be planned? I think that in the future, when we reach the communist society, all the rivers and mountains of our motherland, including Nujiang and Lancangjiang, will be transformed and utilized. "The distant mountains are forest mountains, the nearby mountains are fruit mountains..." The folk song from Shaanxi Province that Vice Premier Deng quoted will definitely be sung on every hill and river in our motherland. I firmly believe that after the implementation of several Five-Year Plans in our motherland, the various ethnic groups in Nujiang Prefecture will definitely live a more beautiful life. At that time, there will be many cars running on the Bili Snow Mountain, and there may be many ships going up and down the Nujiang River. The current stone mountains may grow green crops. I do not want to grow old, and I will definitely participate in this great construction with my own hands and personally experience that happy and beautiful life.

The Five-Year Plan is the foundation of socialist construction. Formulating it and implementing it is the victory of us various ethnic groups. However, representatives, our victory is the enemy's failure, and our happiness is the enemy's misfortune. From my recent inspections in Nujiang and Lijiang, I have seen that domestic and foreign enemies are not willing to fail. In the interior, counter-revolutionaries assassinate cadres and sabotage mutual aid and cooperation. When the state was surveying forests in Lijiang, counter-revolutionaries set fire to thirteen places around the surveyors in half a day. There were also many cases of arson and poisoning in cities and villages. On the border, special agents and spies of American imperialism are always lurking, using religious cloaks to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Last year, the enemy shamelessly lured Gongan ethnic believers to escape. However, we are true gold, and true gold is not afraid of fire. I am also a Christian and participated in the formulation of the Constitution, which stipulates religious freedom. The facts over the past few years have also proven to be free. The enemy's slander and inducement are just a thin layer of sugar coating over dog feces, and poison wrapped in rice balls. The escaped believers knew they had been tricked by the enemy and returned. But from this, we can draw a lesson: we must seriously implement various policies and not let the enemy find loopholes. The enemy will try to find gaps and create fissures. Therefore, we must be especially vigilant, strengthen ethnic unity, and not let imperialist elements come to sabotage. We must resolutely suppress those who make friends with the enemy, ethnic public enemies, whether in the interior or on the border. In addition, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law is a necessary measure to strengthen national defense and safeguard the peaceful construction of the motherland. It is the fundamental interest and glorious duty of various ethnic groups. Taiwan is still waiting to be liberated, and imperialism is still trying to sabotage our cause in every possible way. Various ethnic groups must support this Military Service Law, so as to safeguard the border ethnic groups and safeguard the socialist construction of the motherland.

The Five-Year Plan is the foundation of our happiness. No matter where or who, we should contribute as much as we can to build a great motherland. I am willing to lead the various ethnic groups of Nujiang Prefecture under the leadership of the Communist Party and higher state organs, improve the capabilities of autonomous organs, implement various policies, develop the economy and cultural education, and especially plan production in mountainous areas according to local conditions, gradually develop production mutual aid groups, produce more grain, and in the current situation, even if it is only gradually reducing some of the grain supply from the interior to us, I think it is also a support for industrial construction. Nujiang Prefecture has many industrial raw materials, mountain products, and local specialties that can be exported to exchange industrial equipment. We should produce and collect them in large quantities. To strive for the early arrival of a socialist society, we must strive in every possible way and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan!

I am a scientific and technological worker, and I will discuss the development of the national economy from this perspective.

First of all, I fully agree with the priority development of heavy industry as the central link of socialist industrialization. This is a necessary step for a backward country to catch up with an advanced country, that is, the so-called "catching up." Before liberation, this was impossible, so China could not shake off the colonial-type economy. Now, China has taken the road of independent economy and absolutely cannot tolerate the existence of colonial-type economy. We must establish a new type of industry and build it on a solid and healthy foundation of heavy industry. Of course, a lot of effort is needed to do the foundation work, but this is indispensable effort. Heavy rolling mills and heavy forging presses are only a few meters high, but their foundations are as deep as tens of meters. Any building or bridge must start from the foundation. A large tree must also take root before it can bloom and bear fruit. Isn't this common sense? The Chinese people have the excellent tradition of hard work and thrift, and the wisdom of long-term planning, and they will definitely accept this steady policy and temporarily reduce some material demands to do a good job in the foundation of heavy industry.

Secondly, balance is the key to economic planning. Our Five-Year Plan has made meticulous considerations and arrangements for various balances, and on the basis of needs and possibilities, has achieved a reasonable match. For example, the plan mentions: the balance of industrial regions, the balance of investment ratios, the balance of light industry, heavy industry, and transportation, the balance of grain and economic crops, the balance of national central planning and local planning, the balance of scientific research planning, the balance of labor force, etc., all of which are important links. I think these balance works are done correctly. However, the number of new railway lines seems to be a bit less, and it is not easy to meet the needs of a wide area, especially to play the role of a construction vanguard in some areas that are yet to be developed. I hope that a part of the savings can be allocated to increase the construction of new railway lines.

Thirdly, our plan is a grand plan. The people of the whole country are excited about this. But some people doubt whether it can be completed. I think it is worth pointing out that the speed and acceleration of industrial development. Speed is the index of industrial development, while acceleration is the index of increasing speed. As the conditions for industrial development gradually improve, the speed will increase, and the role of acceleration will be played. The plan explanation does not mention acceleration, but it is obviously not an omission but is done for ease of understanding, because from the figures, it can be seen that acceleration exists. The priority development of heavy industry is the ability to accelerate the development of industry and agriculture, and it is also a guarantee. The selfless help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and China's excellent and abundant labor potential, are also guarantees to achieve acceleration. If we make full use of these favorable factors to maintain and increase the speed of industrial development, this grand first Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed, and it can even be completed ahead of schedule.

Based on the above reasons, I believe that the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is reasonable, meticulous, and practical, and I propose that the conference approve it.

Since the focus of the Five-Year Plan is industry, it gives us scientific and technological workers a more arduous task. With the rapid development of industry, many new problems have emerged, and we need to work hard to solve them. Specifically: industrial standards are the key issue of industrialization, and we need to establish them as soon as possible. The new Soviet equipment is increasing, and we should further make good use of and maintain it, not let it be idle or damaged. There are so many new industrial products, and we need to engage in research, design, and manufacturing to meet various needs. Industrial talents are far from enough, and they are also lagging behind the quality requirements. We need to strengthen various training and cultivation to produce enough and qualified talents. Scientific research has only an initial foundation and cannot meet the needs of industry. Soviet experts have worked selflessly to help China's industrial construction. We should learn from them in a more organized way to fully grasp new technologies and new working methods. These are urgent but must be solved through long-term efforts. In particular, we must not overlook that China's industrialization must be socialist industrialization; that is, it must be progressive, efficient, serving the needs of the people, and serving the overall and long-term interests of the industry. The arduousness of the task will inevitably bring many difficulties, but I believe that scientific and technological workers will not bow down to difficulties. We must study hard and work hard, accumulate experience from learning and working, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, achieve self-reform, and improve our professional and political ideological levels. In this way, we can gradually complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the state through long-term and unremitting efforts.

I have long recognized the superiority of the Soviet economic plan from my work experience. During the War of Resistance, I even did some introductory and promotional work. At that time, due to the wounds of the War of Resistance and the corruption of the Kuomintang government, I was frustrated because I did not know when the planned economy could be implemented in China. But I never imagined that only a few years later, the planned economy would be implemented in China, and in the two years of implementation, it has already achieved brilliant and great achievements. From these facts, my understanding of the superiority of socialism, the working class, the Communist Party, and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao has deepened. I deeply feel that it is a great honor to participate in the discussion and review of the first Five-Year Plan. I will definitely contribute my greatest efforts to strive for the realization of this plan.

I fully support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, and I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will only talk about the work of streamlining state organs.

Streamlining state organs, reducing state administrative expenditures, is an important policy of our country, a necessary means of thrift and accumulation of construction funds, and a powerful measure to improve the work of state organs and ensure the smooth progress of state construction. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, several rounds of streamlining work have been carried out in state organs, and continuous efforts have been made to combat bureaucratism, which has played an important role in improving the work of state organs and ensuring the completion of various tasks. Now the problem is that in the process of rapid development of various construction undertakings, state organs have produced and more clearly exposed many irrational phenomena. The main manifestations are: the upper-level leadership organs of the state have overlapping organizations, large establishments, redundant personnel, low work efficiency, chaotic work order, while the grassroots units lack backbone and weak leadership, and cannot adapt to the current complex and heavy economic construction work and rural work tasks. In the leadership organs, many college graduates and technical personnel are engaged in general administrative work, while many factories, mines, enterprises, and scientific research institutions lack professional talents and technical personnel. Many administrative departments have a large proportion of non-production and non-business personnel, with many reaching more than 30% of the total personnel. Many enterprises and institutions have a large proportion of non-production and non-business personnel, with many reaching more than 30% of the total personnel. Many organs arbitrarily set up organizations and expand establishments, making many personnel in the organs have nothing to do or have very little to do. Many organs' administrative organizations and business organizations are confused, or the number of personnel exceeding the establishment of administrative units is squeezed into business units, or the work of business units is completely handled in the same way as administrative organs, without fixed personnel and quotas, without economic accounting. There are also some organs that do not follow personnel systems, appoint personnel at will, and do not pay attention to the political situation of personnel, giving various counter-revolutionary elements the opportunity to hide and live. Some central organs have many things that should be handed over to the local but are not handed down, or unnecessary duplicate organs are set up in the local. Due to the large size of the organization and many levels, it leads to unclear responsibilities, cumbersome procedures, delays, and at the same time, it also promotes the occurrence and development of bureaucratism and officialism. The phenomenon of many documents, reports, meetings, and general mobilization, and less inspection and specific guidance of work is quite common. All these phenomena, if not corrected in time and resolutely, will inevitably cause serious damage to the state construction cause.

In order to reasonably use the manpower and financial resources of the state, further improve the work of state organs, strengthen the leadership of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and carry out the streamlining work of state organs and various state enterprises and institutions in a planned and step-by-step manner, it is completely necessary.

In January of this year, under the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the State Council established the Compilation and Salary Commission to be responsible for the streamlining work of state organs and decided to implement the policy of streamlining organizations, tightening establishments, and adjusting cadres, first in the central organs. After several months of work, it has been proven that the organizations of state organs can be made more streamlined, and personnel can be reduced, and the reduction is quite large. As of the end of June, according to incomplete statistics, government organs have reduced the original number of personnel by more than 40%, and the direct organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have reduced the original number of personnel by 47%. This work is still ongoing and will continue until the final determination of the new establishment plan, and the reduction will be even larger.

How to carry out the streamlining? The most basic method is for each unit to combine work inspections, summarize experiences, clarify the scope of business and work methods, and on this basis, study the streamlining plan and determine the new establishment plan. Whenever there are irrational phenomena in the organization and establishment, it is often due to problems in the understanding of the scope of business and the arrangement of work methods. Each unit must study clearly what is the business it is responsible for, what is the business it collaborates with other units to handle. Among the business it is responsible for, which is the first, which is the second and third, which things are to be centralized to the central government to manage, which things are to be decentralized to the local government to manage, which things are to be held today, which things are to be held gradually in the future, etc. From the comprehensive situation of various units, we now have the main problems in the organization and establishment, which are too many overlapping organizations, too many intermediate levels, too many non-business personnel, which not only waste manpower but also affect the work efficiency and quality of the organs. Our streamlining work focuses on these aspects. According to the new establishment plans reported by eleven units, the number of departments and bureaus is reduced by 10%, and the number of sections and offices is reduced by 34.7%. Some units have reduced the number of sections, offices, and groups by more than 50%, and some have even reduced them by more than 70%. Most units have changed from the previous four-level or five-level system to a three-level or two-level system. Seven units have abolished seventeen second-level local organs and significantly tightened the establishment of eight second-level local organs, reducing more than 3,600 people. These measures can save a large number of working personnel and free up many backbones. Non-business personnel, that is, administrative management personnel and service personnel, can also be greatly reduced; for example, service personnel, the Agricultural Department has reduced by 74.5%, the Forestry Department has reduced by 63.8%, the Supreme People's Court has reduced by 56%, and many units have reduced by more than 50%. In addition, after calculating the workload, most business organs have saved some people, and some business organs with fewer people have also been adjusted, appropriately increasing personnel and strengthening leadership. The cadres drawn out during the streamlining, in addition to the necessary adjustments within the central organs, can also be transferred out more than 20,000 cadres to strengthen the local organs and grassroots production units.

The correct handling of personnel drawn out during the streamlining is the most important link to thoroughly complete the streamlining work, and a series of complex practical problems must be solved with a serious and responsible attitude, and this work must be done well. We believe that the personnel drawn out during the streamlining are valuable assets of the state, and they will all be used more reasonably or properly arranged, and thus can play a greater role in the state construction cause. Specifically, first, a large number of personnel should be allocated to strengthen the local organs and grassroots production units. Here, the main objects are two kinds of people: one is old cadres with certain practical work experience, and the other is a large number of young intellectual cadres; the former can enrich the backbone of the grassroots, and the latter can be tempered in actual work; among them, some professional talents who were not used properly in the past can also be reasonably adjusted. Second, a batch of young cadres should be sent to various schools to learn, to cultivate construction talents for the state, some can take the college entrance examination, and some can be sent to secondary technical schools to learn technology. Third, the reduced service personnel can be transferred to work in lower-level organs, or sent to technical schools to learn, or arranged by the labor department to work in factories, mines, and state farms, and a few who wish to return home to produce can be handled according to the retirement method. The above three items will account for the vast majority of the personnel reduced in this streamlining. In addition, for a few people who have lost the ability to work, and those who suffer from chronic diseases and need long-term rest, appropriate methods should be adopted to make proper arrangements. We are formulating specific implementation methods and steps according to the above principles and are ready to start the work of handling personnel transferred and leaving their posts, and carrying out cadre adjustments. From this, some people compare our streamlining with the "layoffs" of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, some people think that the personnel drawn out during the streamlining will become a "big burden" for the state, and some people are concerned that the streamlining work will greatly increase the phenomenon of social unemployment, all of which are incorrect, all of which are looking at the streamlining work from a negative perspective, rather than from a positive perspective. Of course, some leaders of organs only transfer out personnel who are difficult to allocate work, or treat the transferred-out personnel as "pushed out and done with," these practices are wrong and must be corrected. Some transferred and leaving-post personnel do not want to obey the state's allocation, do not want to leave big cities, do not want to go to the grassroots, do not want to go to rural areas and factories and mines, these thoughts are wrong and must be educated and corrected.

Now, the streamlining work of the central organs is mostly in the process of drafting new establishment plans, but from the achievements obtained, the effect is very good. Many units have studied business, adjusted organizations, established some systems, improved work methods and leadership styles during the streamlining process. The past phenomena of overlapping organizations, too many levels, unclear business scope, unclear work responsibilities, repeated work, delays, and even no one taking responsibility; the past phenomena of redundant personnel, some cadres not being diligent, having emotions, low enthusiasm, weak sense of responsibility, loose discipline, and low work efficiency; the past phenomena of too many service personnel and non-business personnel, too many documents, reports, and meetings, etc., have all begun to improve. Some problems that were difficult to solve in the past have also become easy to solve. In the past, there were always not enough houses, not enough furniture, and not enough cars to sit in, but now the situation has changed. Now, it is necessary to consider the problem of reducing the administrative building construction plan, and the problem of recovering a large number of cars, sofas, carpets, and other furniture for other disposal. Of course, such problems are easier to solve than the problem of everyone stretching out their hands to get things.

These are only the initial achievements. In the future, various organs will determine the new establishment plan and reasonably adjust personnel, and must pay attention to improving work style, establishing a good work order, and making the work better than before. They must also establish and improve the corresponding work system. In the future, no matter which organ increases the establishment and increases personnel, it must go through a certain approval procedure, and the organs in charge of establishment and personnel work must also pay attention to checking and supervising the implementation. Only in this way can the positive role of the streamlining work be fully played, and the achievements of the streamlining work be consolidated.

Because the work of streamlining state organs is very necessary at present, and there are many benefits to be gained from its implementation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have decided to gradually carry out the streamlining work nationwide, strengthen the management of establishments, and not only administrative leadership organs should be streamlined, but also enterprises and institutions should be streamlined. We must resolutely implement the central policy, earnestly promote the streamlining work, and in conjunction with the launch of the thrift movement, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and struggle, improve the leadership work style, improve the work efficiency of state organs, and strive for the completion of the first Five-Year Plan!

We have repeatedly read and studied the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and listened to the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, as well as the speech of Vice Premier Chen Yun. I, like everyone else, fully support it and am determined to strive for its realization.

I feel that a happy and beautiful future is concretely and comprehensively displayed before us. Our country's socialist construction has obtained a powerful guarantee, and I sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I have been very excited for several days, and I really feel the poverty of my vocabulary. I really cannot find the right words to express my excitement. I have searched through the Twenty-Four Histories, the works of great politicians of all ages, and the works of scholars of all ages, and I have never seen such a great work. This is unprecedented in history, and it is only possible for the revolution led by the working class to make such a detailed plan for the long-term and highest interests of the Chinese people and lead us to victory.

I deeply feel honored and happy to be a person living in the great era of Mao Zedong. We are fortunate to witness such a great era. How can we not devote our heart and soul to contribute our strength wholeheartedly? How can we not serve the people sincerely and honestly? How can we not strive to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan?

We must never forget that the better we build, the more the enemy will not be reconciled. Today, our country is carrying out the most glorious and great cause that our ancestors have never done under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the enemy hates it even more. Therefore, we must not only focus on construction but also raise our political vigilance, eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionary elements hidden within us to safeguard our beautiful construction cause.

Regarding the cultivation of construction cadres and the strengthening of scientific research work, I would like to say a few words and seek your advice.

To build a socialist society and make our country a highly modernized industrial country, the problem of cultivating cadres is becoming more and more important. Stalin said in 1935: "Personnel, cadres are the most precious and decisive capital among all the precious capital in the world." He also said: "If we have a large number of excellent cadres in industry, agriculture, transportation, and the army, then our country will be invincible. If we do not have such cadres, then we will be unable to move a step." As educators, we feel the seriousness of the responsibility of cultivating cadres even more. Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in his report: "The lack of scientific and technological personnel is obviously a great difficulty in our progress." Therefore, he pointed out that cultivating personnel who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the socialist cause, who have modern scientific knowledge, and who are various construction personnel is one of the major political tasks we must complete. This means: the various construction personnel we urgently need, not only need to have a high level of scientific and technological knowledge, but more importantly, they need to be wholeheartedly, unlimitedly loyal, and loyal to the people's democratic system. Our colleges and universities must continuously provide this most precious and decisive capital to the various battlefields of the motherland's construction, that is, to be responsible for cultivating technical talents who are good at technology, healthy in body, and politically reliable for the state. We not only need to ensure the quantity but more importantly, we need to ensure the quality. Therefore, our teaching must implement the educational policy of all-around development, not only to focus on professional education but also to strengthen political and ideological education, and pay attention to health education. We need to make the knowledge, physique, and politics of students reach a certain quality, and if one of the three is missing, it will be difficult to undertake the sacred task of building the motherland.

Our higher normal schools have established nineteen new schools in five years, and the number of graduates from higher normal schools in five years is 70,400, accounting for 24.9% of all higher education students, which means that in five years, one-quarter of the graduates from colleges and universities will be cultivated by our higher normal schools. This is a great and important responsibility given to us by the state. Graduates from higher normal schools are mostly teachers for secondary schools, and the cultivation of various high-level technical cadres needs to lay a good foundation in secondary schools. Our work is not only to cultivate cadres for the first Five-Year Plan but also to lay a good foundation for cultivating cadres for the second and third Five-Year Plans and to prepare reserve forces for building socialism. Our work is an important component of construction. If our work is not done well, the quality of graduates cannot be guaranteed, then our entire construction plan will be affected. Today, our higher normal education work still has shortcomings, and the quality of cadres cultivated is still not completely in line with the requirements of the state. Therefore, we who are engaged in higher normal education work must not be slack in the future and must strive to improve teaching and ensure and guarantee the quality of education. This is to implement the spirit of "a hundred years of planning, quality first" in education work.

To truly achieve quality improvement and quality assurance, we must first improve our teachers' thinking and strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and current policies, so that we can conduct teaching with the correct stance, viewpoint, and method. We must also continue to strengthen scientific research work, gradually carry out academic thought criticism, promote materialism, criticize bourgeois idealism, and make scientific research truly combined with teaching and combined with the needs of national construction. In the future, the deeper the teaching reform, the more the academic criticism will be carried out; the more the economic construction develops, the more we will feel the importance of scientific research, and scientific research work must be strengthened. While strengthening scientific research, teaching itself will also be continuously improved. Therefore, the improvement of teachers' political level and professional level is the most important link to ensure teaching quality, and this is what we must first achieve in completing the state construction plan.

I am an educator and a scientist. I am willing to work with everyone to study Marxism-Leninism more diligently so that we can better conduct scientific research. However, as Guo Moruo Vice Chairman said: "Old people will inevitably feel difficulties, that is because our old ideas are playing tricks." We old people are indeed like this. But it is precisely because of this that we must redouble our efforts with the greatest willpower to overcome this difficulty and strive to complete the important tasks entrusted to us by the state and the people!

Our motherland is rapidly advancing towards a beautiful socialist society. The things that our ancestors could not do, we are creating today; the ideals that our ancestors could not complete, we are realizing today. In the future, all ethnic groups in our country will unite as one under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the selfless help of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and with the concern and support of the people of the world who love peace, our strength is invincible. We have full confidence, just as Chairman Mao instructed us at the last meeting: "Our goal must be achieved. Our goal must be achieved."

Since the opening of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, we have listened to five reports, and I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support these reports. Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" has given me great encouragement and increased my confidence in the future of China's socialist construction. China was economically and culturally backward due to the rule of imperialism and feudal forces. Under the correct leadership of the great Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao, we have achieved revolutionary victory. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in just three years, we have successfully completed the restoration of the national economy and immediately began the Five-Year Plan. From Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report, we know that in the first Five-Year Plan, industrial construction is the focus, and industries such as steel, electricity, and machinery manufacturing will have significant development, which will lay the initial foundation for China's socialist industrialization. China's first Five-Year Plan is large-scale and fast-paced. In addition to the 156 large enterprises established with the help of the Soviet Union, there are also thousands of medium and small enterprises, most of which will be completed within five years. The transitional period's general line announced by the Communist Party has pointed out the direction of effort for the people of the whole country; it is like a lighthouse illuminating our path forward. In this Five-Year Plan, we have seen the Communist Party and Chairman Mao arrange every detail of China's socialist construction so correctly, concretizing the party's general line during the transitional period, making us clearly understand how to advance actively and steadily and build China into a great socialist country.

I am an elementary school teacher. The task of all elementary school teachers in China is to cultivate all-around new people for the motherland and cultivate builders and defenders of a socialist society. This is a very glorious and arduous task. I will definitely work with millions of elementary education workers and the people of the whole country with great enthusiasm on this glorious post to strive for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan. We know that as long as we do our own work well, overcome difficulties, and correct shortcomings, we can promote the faster completion of the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the tasks we undertake, like other tasks of building the motherland, are equally great and glorious. We elementary school teachers must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, work with people of all classes and ethnic groups in the country to participate more actively in national political life and construction.

Since liberation, we elementary school teachers have gone through several social reforms and political and professional studies, and our ideological awareness and teaching professional level have improved. Teachers have shown initiative and creativity, summarized many experiences, and produced many model figures. Therefore, students' academic performance has also made some progress, which is the main aspect. However, on the other hand, at present, there is still a widespread bourgeois ideology among elementary school teachers, and there are still hidden counter-revolutionaries and serious lawbreakers in our ranks. This situation is obviously not in line with the realization of our glorious task of cultivating socialist new people. To complete the tasks assigned to us by the state, what is our most urgent work at present? On the one hand, we must actively participate in the current ideological criticism work, criticize bourgeois ideology, especially bourgeois idealism, and study Marxism-Leninism, especially dialectical materialism. We must resolutely oppose the erroneous view of focusing on business and neglecting politics. We must pay attention to politics, pay attention to state affairs, and pay attention to the socialist construction cause. We must oppose the use of bourgeois attitudes towards students, favoring or disliking based on personal preferences, opposing the use of bourgeois viewpoints and methods in teaching and education work, not teaching people, only teaching books, not caring about students' health and morality, and even having the phenomenon of corporal punishment and not respecting students' personalities. These are all contrary to the national education policy. On the other hand, for the counter-revolutionaries and serious lawbreakers hidden in our ranks, we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them and not allow them to continue to sabotage the people's education cause. We must be vigilant, expose all counter-revolutionaries in our ranks, expose all serious lawbreaking behaviors, and purify our ranks. This is the most important work for all elementary school teachers at present, and we must strive to do it.

I deeply feel that in this great era, if we do not strive to study political theory and national policies, we will not be able to keep up with the objective situation and the needs of the work, and we will fall behind. I grew up in the old society and was influenced by a lot of bourgeois idealism. In practical experience, I have felt that as long as these things appear in my mind, problems will immediately arise in my work, hindering my own progress and the unity of my comrades, causing losses to the work. Therefore, we must strive to catch up with the requirements of the times.

In recent years, the government has attached great importance to the work of teachers' continuing education. In the first Five-Year Plan, it is also mentioned that we should actively, extensively, and systematically carry out part-time cultural and educational work, and establish a large number of regular part-time schools and correspondence schools to enable in-service cadres who have not received systematic scientific education and cultural education to have the opportunity to systematically improve their cultural, scientific, and technological levels step by step. Teachers with low cultural levels can participate in continuing education schools, correspondence schools, or self-study according to their own levels, and systematically improve themselves. This is also an urgent task for us elementary school teachers at present. Only by continuously improving ourselves can we improve the quality of our educational work.

In the future, our educational work will serve the realization of the Five-Year Plan and must implement the educational policy of all-around development, improve the quality of school education work, and everything must be based on the interests of national socialist construction. We must continue to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet education, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of thrift and hard work in completing the first Five-Year Plan, and carry forward the hard-working style of teachers in the old liberated areas. We are now walking a road that, as our great leader Chairman Mao said, is a road that our ancestors have not walked. Along this road, our motherland is changing its appearance day by day and approaching the happy life of communism. We elementary school teachers are willing to dedicate all our strength. We will align with the workers on the production front and use our wisdom and talents to educate a new generation with creative labor and strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan.

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the "Comprehensive Plan to Control Yellow River Water Disasters and Develop Yellow River Water Resources," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the "Draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the "Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." These reports are completely in line with the highest and long-term interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and I fully agree with and support them and will strive to implement the great first Five-Year Plan.

The various ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southwestern border of the motherland have gradually realized the various self-governing rights stipulated in the Constitution after implementing regional autonomy. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and higher state organs, and with the enthusiastic concern and great help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Han people, we have seen various ethnic groups and ethnic groups within our area become more and more closely united day by day, and the material and cultural lives of the people have been continuously improved. For example, the increase in several major agricultural productions in 1954 compared to 1953 is as follows: rice increased by 6.9%, tea increased by 26.4%, cotton increased by 29.25%, and camphor increased by 200%. After the road was opened, the sales price of industrial products also decreased by 8.33% to 33.4%. Industrial and agricultural products have also been reasonably exchanged, thereby increasing the income of the people, improving the living standards of the people, and the purchasing power of rural areas in 1954 averaged 40 yuan per person. This year, it is estimated to increase to about 50 yuan. At the time of initial liberation, we only had a few small schools with more than 500 students. Now it has increased by more than eight times. In addition to sending some students to the Central, Southwest, and Provincial Nationality Institutes and other specialized schools, there is now one Nationality Cadres School in Xishuangbanna with 464 students, one Junior Normal School with 115 students; 45 primary schools with more than 4,700 students, of which more than 72% of the primary school students are children of local ethnic groups. Recently, the Central approved our trial plan to improve the Dai script, assisted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yunnan Provincial Nationality Affairs Commission. In this way, the culture and education of Xishuangbanna will definitely develop more rapidly. So far, the number of health institutions in the whole region has increased by more than ten compared to 1950, and the number of health workers has also increased by more than 100. In the past two years, more than 225,100 people of various ethnic groups have received free treatment, thereby greatly reducing the diseases and deaths of the people, ensuring the health of the people of various ethnic groups, and guaranteeing the people to produce with peace of mind. Now, in the various departments and systems of the Autonomous Prefecture, the number of local ethnic cadres has reached 44.98% of the total, and in many departments of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, local ethnic cadres are responsible for the main work. Han and Dai have become the working tools of the autonomous organs.

However, we still have many shortcomings, mainly that we have not fully realized the self-governing rights of the autonomous organs, and for those who endanger the lives and property of the state and the people, such as counter-revolutionaries and various criminals, we have not punished them in time, giving counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to take advantage. On the other hand, we are not proactive enough in seeking the help of the Han people and Han cadres, timely reflecting the situation to the higher authorities, and seeking the leadership and help of the higher authorities. The work of cultivating and educating cadres, especially the education of ethnic cadres, and improving quality is also done poorly. In the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party and higher state organs, we will strive to overcome these shortcomings while advancing along the socialist road. Xishuangbanna is located on the border of the motherland, facing the conspiracies and sabotage of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. They are not reconciled to failure and are scheming various conspiracies and sabotage activities in the border areas, such as recently inciting ethnic unity, spreading rumors, sabotaging production, sabotaging transportation, threatening the masses, and even killing and arson in the border areas. This year, 20 cases of houses and warehouses have been burned down in the whole region, and in May, the town of Mengzhe in Xishuangbanna was burned down by counter-revolutionaries, causing a loss of more than 200,000 yuan in the Department Store, and 31 households of houses were burned down. The reason why counter-revolutionaries are so arrogant is mainly due to the desperate struggle of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, while on the other hand, it is also because our vigilance is not high, and we have not punished the enemy's sabotage activities in time, resulting in the loss of lives and property of the state and the people. We must implement Article 19 of the Constitution, which stipulates: "The People's Republic of China defends the people's democratic system, suppresses all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities, and punishes all traitors and counter-revolutionaries." To defend the lives and property of various ethnic groups, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, defend the sacred territory of the motherland, support the liberation of Taiwan, and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group, the various ethnic groups of Xishuangbanna must, under the leadership of the Communist Party and higher state organs, continue to strengthen unity, improve the patriotic awareness of the people of various ethnic groups, strengthen self-defense, eliminate bandits and spies, resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and handle various criminal cases according to law to smash any conspiracy and sabotage by American imperialism and its running dogs at any time!

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the "Draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the "Comprehensive Plan to Control Yellow River Water Disasters and Develop Yellow River Water Resources," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the "Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." These reports have given me a profound education and great encouragement.

From the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuquan and Vice Premier Deng Zihui, we can clearly see the bright and glorious future of our country's strength and the happiness of the people. The long-cherished dreams of the Chinese people are now being realized step by step under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao through their hard work. As a revolutionary soldier, I feel an even greater sense of responsibility and the glory of our cause. Since the beginning of planned construction by the state, various aspects of our construction have already developed rapidly, and people's lives have improved continuously. At the same time, with the development of economic construction, our national defense construction has also developed further. From the perspective of the military, our weapons and equipment have been greatly improved, and the supply of materials has become more sufficient. Our soldiers have received many weapons made by our motherland, and they are all excited. They regard these weapons as a symbol of the development of China's socialist industry and regard them as the high expectations and solemn entrustment of the motherland to each soldier. Since July of last year, the airplanes made by our motherland have also begun to fly in the sky of the motherland. All of this has inspired the commanders and fighters of our troops, greatly strengthened our will and determination to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and defend peace. Our commanders and fighters deeply know: imperialism is extremely hostile to the victories we have achieved and to the people of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp; American imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan and is actively supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group, attempting to launch a sudden attack on us. In this situation, only by strengthening our national defense forces and accelerating the modernization of our army can we effectively prevent imperialist aggression and create a peaceful and secure environment for our socialist construction. But at the same time, we also know: the modernization of the army is inseparable from the industrialization of the state. Therefore, the comrades in the troops have high expectations for the socialist industrialization of the state and hope that the state will provide more large quantities of new aircraft, large guns, tanks, ships, and other weapons and equipment. Now, the formulation of the Five-Year Construction Plan and the Military Service Law has created very favorable conditions for the modernization of national defense. We, the commanders and fighters of the entire army, are excited and inspired. We firmly believe: relying on the powerful material foundation of the industrialization of the state and the well-trained active and reserve soldiers, if imperialism dares to launch an aggressive war, they will suffer a crushing blow!

To ensure the smooth implementation of the state's Five-Year Plan, the determination and actual actions of each revolutionary soldier are: to train hard, unremittingly improve combat skills, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. I am currently studying at a military school, and I am determined to study the advanced military science of the Soviet Union with the greatest diligence. In daily study and work, we must always be vigilant against the enemy, not only to watch out for the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism but also to be vigilant against hidden counter-revolutionaries. The Pan Han-nian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incidents have also told us: a revolutionary soldier must not only learn to fight against open enemies but also learn to fight against disguised enemies. We must thoroughly clean out those scoundrels who are harming the state and the people's army. To support the socialist construction of the state, I am determined to follow the model actions of the Party and the state's policies and various specific measures, as instructed by Vice Premier Li Fuquan in his report, to practice thrift, oppose waste, educate subordinates, and pay more attention to the love and protection of weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials, carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work of the people's army, and make every bit of the state's property effectively used for the development of the national economy and national defense. I heard that Minister Shi Liang's speech

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report on the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved brilliant victories on all fronts. The first Five-Year Plan is a major step in realizing the general task of the transitional period and building our country into a great socialist industrial power. This is a symbol of the victory of the Chinese people. With the implementation and successful progress of the first Five-Year Plan, people's democratic dictatorship will be further consolidated. However, our enemies also know that the more we succeed, the more they fail. Whatever we want to do, the enemy will inevitably try to sabotage it. As one of the weapons of people's democratic dictatorship, the people's judicial organs should fully understand this, maintain high vigilance at all times, and fulfill their duties to ensure the smooth progress of the state's socialist construction and socialist transformation. In April 1953, the Second National Judicial Conference determined that judicial work must serve economic construction. In the past two years, judicial organs across the country have carried out work in accordance with this policy. After the Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts were passed and promulgated by the First National People's Congress and the First Session of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice held a meeting of the presidents of the higher people's courts and the directors of the judicial departments of provinces and municipalities in November 1954 to study the Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts and discuss how to implement the Organic Law of the People's Courts. Subsequently, the judicial departments of provinces and municipalities and the higher people's courts also held meetings of the main cadres above the basic people's courts, and the implementation was carried out step by step. In June of this year, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice held another judicial work seminar to check the implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts. According to the reports from various places, all places that have held people's congresses have elected the presidents of the people's courts in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts. Some places have already implemented the system of reporting work to the people's congresses. In addition to the courts in border areas, the vast majority of people's courts have basically implemented the systems of public trial, jury, collegial panel, defense, and recusal as stipulated in the Organic Law of the People's Courts. So far, 127,250 people's assessors have been selected nationwide, and the system of rotating assessors is implemented. The vast majority of first-instance cases have implemented the system of assessors. The broad masses of the people have participated in the management of the state, and they say: "The people's court is really our own court," "Now the people are really the masters." The participation of the masses in the trial has greatly improved the quality and speed of case handling. All first-instance cases that have implemented the system of people's assessors have implemented the system of collegial panel. The second-instance cases of the higher people's courts of 20 provinces and municipalities, such as Liaoning and Shanghai, and the intermediate people's courts in cities have also universally implemented the system of collegial panel. The implementation of the system of collegial panel has played a great role in overcoming the bad trial style of subjectivism, arbitrariness, and partiality of the judicial personnel. The trial of cases by people's courts at all levels, except for those that should not be tried in public as stipulated by law, has already been done publicly. The system of recusal and defense has also been universally implemented in the trial. In addition to fully defending themselves and, if necessary, having the people's court appoint a defender for them, the defendants can also have their relatives or other defenders who meet the legal requirements defend them. We have also tried the system of people's lawyers in large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, and after gaining necessary experience, we will gradually promote it. The broad masses of the people are very satisfied with the implementation of the system of public trial and defense. Some places have reflected: "The court handles cases in this way, satisfying three parties," that is, the plaintiff, the defendant, and the masses. With the implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, the judicial style of the judicial cadres has been improved. Due to complex historical factors, social factors, and the influence of bourgeois idealism, there is still a bad trial style of subjectivism, arbitrariness, and partiality in the current judicial work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership of the people's courts at all levels and the supervision of the people's courts at higher levels over the people's courts at lower levels, strengthen the study of materialism, and strengthen the supervision of the people's congresses at all levels over the work of the people's courts at all levels to resolutely overcome this bad trial style. From January 1954 to May of this year, the people's courts at all levels nationwide accepted 364,604 initial cases of counter-revolutionary and economic construction-related cases (lacking statistical figures for Xinjiang Province and some individual regions of other provinces for this year), accounting for 30.92% of the criminal cases during the same period. Thus, the activities of counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders have been suppressed, and some major responsibility accident cases that should bear criminal responsibility have been handled. In more than 170 factories, mines, and enterprises, trial production of self-education and self-reformation for the masses by the workers has been carried out, and some responsibility accidents that do not need to be pursued for legal responsibility and events related to labor discipline have been handled, and propaganda and education have been carried out to improve revolutionary vigilance, observe operational procedures, and observe labor discipline. To ensure the national transportation industry, 11 railway transportation courts and 2 water transportation courts have been established. A total of 294 people's courts have set up notary work. In 1954 alone, 123,000 notary matters were handled. The public-private contracts that have been notarized have more than 90% been fulfilled. This has effectively ensured the legitimate operation of state construction and private industry and commerce, prevented the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists stealing state property and sabotaging contracts. To ensure the smooth progress of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, protect the legitimate interests of the people, and reduce the burden of litigation among the masses, the basic people's courts have established 3,795 itinerant courts and are gradually transforming them into people's courts. A total of 157,966 people's mediation committees have also been established to timely suppress criminals against agricultural socialist transformation and mediate disputes among the people. With the gradual strengthening of various judicial constructions, it has great significance for ensuring the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan for the national economy.

The more victorious the socialist construction cause is, the more the enemy will fail, and they will desperately try to sabotage our state construction cause in various ways. From the number of criminal cases that sabotage economic construction, such as the number of cases of sabotage of economic construction received by Hebei Province in 1954, which increased by 160% compared to 1953, of which counter-revolutionary sabotage increased by 165%, and the cases of sabotage by illegal capitalists and other criminals increased by 106%. In the first quarter of this year, the number of counter-revolutionary cases of sabotage of economic construction received by Shanxi Province increased by two times compared to the same period in 1953, and the number of cases of sabotage of agricultural production cooperatives also increased by more than two times. In the first quarter of 1955, the number of various sabotage cases in Guizhou Province increased by 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 1954. Among them, the number of homicide cases increased by 27.4%, and the number of arson cases increased by 90%. We did not fully understand the current class struggle situation and the enemy's sabotage, and we were blindly intoxicated with the past achievements of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the great victories of state construction, so we ignored these phenomena. There is a widespread phenomenon of "catching but not catching, judging but not judging, and leniently sentencing serious crimes," which has caused great harm to the state and the people, and has encouraged the counter-revolutionaries' sabotage activities. Some counter-revolutionaries even dared to commit violence in court; some even committed crimes again after being released or paroled. According to incomplete statistics from various places, more than 40% of the current counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders are repeat offenders who were released after serving their sentences. These facts prove that we made the error of lenient sentencing and being too lenient towards counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders in the past. The leadership of our Ministry of Justice is responsible for this error. In June, the judicial work seminar seriously checked and criticized this error and decided to strictly implement the principle of severity in the future, requiring the people's courts at all levels to immediately and resolutely correct it. After the first Five-Year Plan is passed by this conference, it will become the goal of struggle for the people of the whole country. State organs and the people of the whole country must make their own contributions to realize this plan. The judicial organs must, in cooperation with the public security and procuratorial organs, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders who dare to sabotage the state's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and continue to punish those who embezzle and steal socialist property and those who constitute criminal responsibility for major responsibility accidents and serious violations of labor discipline, to ensure the smooth implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. We believe that under the correct and wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the support and help of the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and with the joint efforts of state organs and the people of the whole country, our first Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed successfully.

I fully support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy submitted by the State Council to the conference, the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui to the conference. I agree with the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on behalf of the Standing Committee.

Regarding many problems of higher education work, Lin Fen has already spoken, and I fully agree. Now I will only briefly supplement the issue of improving the quality of higher education. According to the requirements of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the country's higher schools will cultivate 283,000 graduates for the state within the first Five-Year Plan, which is equivalent to the total number of graduates from higher schools in the twenty years of the Kuomintang's rule (1928-1947), which is one and a half times the total number of graduates from higher schools in the twenty years of the Kuomintang's rule, of which 94,000 are engineering graduates, which is three times the total number of engineering graduates in the twenty years of the Kuomintang's rule. It is estimated that by 1957, the number of students in higher schools nationwide will reach 434,000, which is 2.2 times the number of students in 1947 (the year with the most students during the Kuomintang's rule); of which 177,000 are engineering students, which is more than six times that of 1947. Since liberation, we have built 4,240,000 square meters of higher school buildings, which is 1,050,000 square meters more than the higher school buildings built in China from 1898 to 1948 over 51 years. This fully shows the concern and attention of the people's democratic government led by the Communist Party for the cultivation of cadres, and it also reflects the rapid development of various aspects of national construction. In the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, the number of graduates from higher schools was 153,000, which has completed 54% of the total task of the Five-Year Plan; of which 50,000 were engineering graduates, which has completed 53% of the total task of the Five-Year Plan. In the second half of 1955, the number of students in school will reach 66% of the total increase of the Five-Year Plan, of which engineering will reach 62%. Although there are still many difficulties in the future development, we believe that the task of the Five-Year Plan can be completed. If the number of applicants for enrollment is large and the quality is good, we will strive to the maximum extent of the teaching force to try to overfulfill the plan.

Due to the concern and attention of the Party and the state for the cultivation of cadres, higher education has developed significantly in recent years and has carried out a series of rectification and reform work. However, from the needs of the state, our work is still far from enough, and there are still many serious shortcomings in the implementation and execution of policies and principles, and many problems have not been well solved. First, the quality of cultivating cadres is far from meeting the requirements of construction; second, the setting and development ratio of various professions in higher schools still cannot completely meet the needs, and it should be appropriately adjusted after quickly investigating the needs of various departments for the second Five-Year Plan; third, the setting and distribution of higher schools still cannot adapt to the development and deployment of the national economy, and in the future, when building new schools, we should, based on the national economic construction plan, try to combine with the new industrial bases as much as possible; fourth, we have not paid enough attention to the work of cultivating part-time education for in-service workers and employees, and in the future, we should take the work of holding part-time education as an important part of the plan for cultivating cadres and carry it out vigorously; fifth, there are still phenomena of irrational use and waste in the aspects of basic construction, personnel establishment, teaching equipment, and other administrative expenses of schools, and in the future, we must resolutely implement the instructions of the central authorities and implement the policy of streamlining and thrift.

To implement the Five-Year Plan, we must solve the above problems in a planned and step-by-step manner to complete the major task of cultivating qualified senior construction cadres. What is a "qualified" cadre? Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report and Lin Fen's speech have clearly pointed out: the cadres we cultivate must be loyal to the motherland and socialist construction, be able to master modern scientific knowledge, and be in good health, that is, to cultivate talents who truly meet the requirements of "good body, good study, good work." If we measure it with this standard, then there are obviously serious shortcomings in our work.

Currently, the quality of cadres cultivated by higher schools is not high, although there are historical and social reasons, but the main reason is still that there are shortcomings in the implementation and execution of policies and principles and in the work. In the past few years of development, we did not seriously consider the situation of insufficient student sources and teacher conditions, and we pursued quantity one-sidedly, paying insufficient attention to ensuring quality. In the work of cultivation, we also failed to correctly implement the educational policy of all-around development, paying less attention to health education, and political and ideological work was particularly weak; in addition, in learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reform, because the foundation was poor, everything was like starting from scratch, so both teachers and students felt busy and hard. Due to these reasons, the quality of the cadres we cultivated is not only low, failing to catch up with the requirements of national construction; moreover, due to insufficient strength, poor health, political quality, etc., the turnover and elimination rate is very high every year. For example, in the academic year of 1953-1954, a total of 7,000 people dropped out, withdrew, or were expelled from school before the end-of-year exam, accounting for about 3.5% of the total number of students in that academic year, of which more than half were unable to continue their studies due to illness, and a part was due to poor political quality. This not only affected the smooth completion of the state's plan for cultivating cadres but also brought great waste of manpower, material, and financial resources to the state. Below, I will specially talk about the situation of students' political quality. It should be said that in recent years, the socialist awareness of students in our higher schools has generally improved a lot, and they are patriotic, diligent in study, disciplined, and obedient to the needs of the state. But this is one aspect, the main aspect; on the other hand, there is still a small part of people with very poor political quality, and it is also not to be ignored. Some are seriously corrupted by bourgeois ideology, morally bankrupt, of bad character, living in decadence, and even forming hooligan gangs to engage in illegal and indisciplined activities. Some students have serious reactionary thoughts, spreading reactionary speeches, dissatisfied with socialism, and some even formed organizations, such as Fudan University and Jiaotong University in Shanghai both uncovered such reactionary organizations. There are also bandits who have infiltrated our higher schools, such as the recent exposure of Cheng Jian'an in Northwest Agricultural University, who was originally a bandit who had been in hiding for more than three years, disguising himself as a student. He was originally a counter-revolutionary bandit of landlord origin who had repeatedly attacked our anti-Japanese troops, killed our cadres, looted property, oppressed the masses, and had a bloody debt. There are also enemies sent to our schools to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In recent years, counter-revolutionary sabotage incidents such as arson, poisoning, theft of documents, damage to machinery and equipment, posting reactionary slogans, etc., have been frequently discovered. Although such criminal elements and politically impure elements are few in number, if they are not cleaned out and prevented from continuing to infiltrate, the damage they may cause to the state's socialist construction cause will be immeasurable.

To meet the needs of national construction and cultivate qualified senior construction talents, the work of higher education in the future must focus on improving quality, especially improving political quality. To this end, the following aspects of work should be carried out.

Implement the principle of "ensuring quality and considering quantity" and improve the enrollment work to improve the quality of new students. To ensure the quality of new students in higher schools, the State Council studied the needs and usage of technical cadres in several industrial departments and the conditions of higher schools, considered the needs and possibilities, adjusted the enrollment tasks of higher schools for the next three years, and determined the principles for improving the enrollment work. In the future, the enrollment of new students in higher schools must strictly conduct political examination and health examination, appropriately raise the standard of admission based on academic performance, and the admitted new students must be politically reliable, able to keep up with the class in academic performance, and have health conditions that can persist in studying. We should also pay attention to attracting workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, demobilized construction soldiers, and minority youth to enroll. Of course, we cannot raise the requirements for new student quality too high at once, detached from the current situation of all aspects, and at the same time, we cannot completely ignore the quantity. Therefore, it should be the correct combination of quality and quantity, and strive to achieve the quantity under the condition of ensuring a certain quality.

For the students in school, we should also rectify them according to the current requirements. For those with serious political problems who cannot be cultivated, or those with extremely bad character who cannot be cultivated, we must resolutely clean them out. For those with poor academic performance or those with poor health who cannot keep up with the class or persist in studying, they should be arranged appropriately according to the situation, which is beneficial to both the state and the students themselves. Naturally, carrying out such rectification is a very complex and detailed work, and it cannot be done hastily. First of all, we must do a good job of ideological work and explain the reasons, not only to make the teachers and students of the school, but also to make the people of all walks of life understand the policy of cultivating cadres by the state and the requirements of ensuring quality, so as to smoothly implement the above measures. Therefore, we cannot rely solely on administrative power to do this, but must, under the leadership of the Party committees of the Communist Party of China at all levels, and with the unanimous efforts of all democratic parties, people's organizations, people of all walks of life, and all teachers and students of higher schools, do a good job of this work. So, I appeal to all representatives to care for and support the above measures.

Improving the level of new student admission and rectifying the existing students in school, as well as the measures of changing the school system of higher schools in a planned and step-by-step manner, appropriately extending the length of study, and gradually abolishing the two-year and three-year specialized courses, undoubtedly provide favorable conditions for higher schools to cultivate higher-quality cadres in the future. However, the most important link to truly ensure quality is that higher schools themselves can improve various aspects of work, especially teaching work.

Due to the poor foundation of higher education in our country, and the urgent need for high-level construction talents in the new China, both quantity and quality are needed, and everyone (including teachers and students) is eager to learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union and catch up quickly, resulting in some requirements being too high and some measures being too urgent, eventually leading to the harm of teachers and students having too heavy teaching burdens, affecting their health, and to varying degrees, affecting their concern for political learning. This should first of all be a self-examination of the leadership work of the Ministry of Higher Education, while the efforts of the majority of teachers and students should be encouraged. Recently, we and various higher schools are actively implementing the educational policy of all-around development, adhering to the principle of "learning less but learning better," appropriately revising the teaching plan and syllabus, and focusing on improving teaching methods, improving teaching materials, and improving teaching effects, which have achieved initial results in many schools. To strengthen students' physique, in addition to carrying out physical exercises, the Ministry of Higher Education is considering appropriately changing the system of student assistance from the state, so as to improve students' diet and nutrition without increasing the financial burden of the state.

Continuously strengthening Marxism-Leninism education is the fundamental method to cultivate young people's correct worldview, improve socialist awareness, and enhance their resistance to the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. Due to the lack of teaching force, the teaching quality of the four political theory courses is generally not high, and we are vigorously improving this aspect of work. With the nationwide promotion of the propaganda of dialectical materialism and the criticism of idealism, dialectical materialism is also being widely carried out among students in higher schools. With the assistance of the Youth League, the work of cultivating young people's communist moral character is also being strengthened. We have more clearly put forward that teachers should establish the idea of being responsible for the "all-around development" of students, implement political and ideological education in teaching activities, cultivate and strengthen learning discipline, and combine "teaching" with "education." These are the primary ideological construction work of higher schools, which requires our long-term efforts.

The key to ensuring the quality of cultivating cadres is the continuous improvement of teachers' political and professional levels. Teaching work is ideological work, and students' thoughts are inseparable from teachers' influences. To improve teaching quality, it is especially important to deepen teachers' ideological transformation. Since the criticism of bourgeois idealism began last year, a large number of bourgeois idealist erroneous thoughts have been exposed in various academic departments of our higher schools. Although the majority of teachers actively participated in the study of materialism, the number of people involved in the criticism of bourgeois idealism is still not widespread, and except for the departments of literature, history, and philosophy, other departments have not carried out it well. Many absurd statements are still circulating and have not received the criticism they deserve, for example, those who hold the erroneous view of "politics cannot lead science" are not yet "extremely individual." To effectively improve teaching work and scientific research work, improve teaching quality, and make higher education work better serve the socialist construction of the state, higher education workers should vigorously strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly criticize the erroneous thoughts of bourgeois idealism, so as to further improve our political awareness and theoretical level, deepen ideological transformation, and in this way, we can better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve our professional level, and thus improve the quality of cultivating cadres.

Through the recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we can see the seriousness of the attack of hidden counter-revolutionaries on schools. Since the key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, such as Xie Tao, Jia Zhiqiang, and Lu Ying, were able to infiltrate our higher schools and occupy the podium for a long time, disguising themselves as people's teachers, then other counter-revolutionaries can certainly infiltrate. The recent exposure and arrest by the public security organs of Zhao Zhenji, who had been hiding for a long time at Yunnan University, is another example. The vast majority of our teachers and students are good people, which is certain; however, as Lin Fen, the director, pointed out, the tendency to neglect politics is serious among many of us. Due to lack of vigilance, it gave the Hu Feng elements and all hidden counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to take advantage of the gaps; due to lack of sensitivity, it allowed reactionary speeches to be openly propagated and spread. We should, through the struggle to clean up the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionaries, improve our political awareness, and push the work of political and ideological education forward by a big step, thoroughly clean out the counter-revolutionaries hidden in our ranks, and safeguard the smooth progress of China's socialist construction. I think this is the minimum requirement for higher education workers from all representatives. I believe we can do this.

Title: Speech by Representative Deng Baoshan
Author:

Page: 1

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

At the meeting on the 21st, Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on the current grain problem in our country was extremely insightful, which gave us great enlightenment and help. Now, I would like to talk about the grain problem, farmers' living conditions, and agricultural increase in Gansu.

Before I went down to the countryside for inspection this year, I also heard that some rural areas in Gansu were facing grain shortages. I had considered this issue from many aspects. Is Gansu really short of grain? Gansu has historically been a grain-deficient province, but this situation has changed significantly. The grain production of the whole province in 1954 was increased by 50% compared to 1950, with an average of about 600 jin of raw grain per agricultural population. Although there are a few disaster-stricken areas that lack grain due to consecutive years of poor harvests, in terms of the whole province, there is no lack of grain. Did the state over-purchase last year? I also did some calculations, and the total grain purchased and levied by the state last year was only 19% of the total production. Excluding public grain and purchased grain, each agricultural population still had an average of about 500 jin of raw grain, which was basically enough to eat and use. Is the state supply too little? If calculated based on the rural sales volume of grain in the 1955 grain year, with an average supply of 120 jin per person per year, it can supply more than 2.7 million people, accounting for more than one-quarter of the agricultural population, and considering that most areas also had a good harvest last year, this supply figure should be said to be only more, not less. All of these cannot be the cause of the grain shortage in rural areas.

So, what is the real cause of the grain shortage in rural areas? I got the answer from this visit to the countryside. According to my understanding, in some areas, for some households, due to the shortcomings in our work, there were indeed cases of over-purchase and non-supply of grain that should have been supplied, but most of them have been corrected, and some are still being corrected. However, the supply coverage is too wide, and the supply volume is too large, which is a more common phenomenon. Take my visit to Ganqu Township in Wuning County and Fujiachuan Township in Yuzhong County as an example. The former is a severely disaster-stricken area that has suffered from drought for three consecutive years, with a grain supply coverage of 86% of the entire township population, and the masses are stable, and grain is not tight. On market days, there are still two to three thousand jin of grain on the market; the latter had a poor summer harvest and an average autumn harvest, with a supply coverage reaching 95%, but the masses are not stable, and grain is very tight. If it is said that the grain shortage in Fujiachuan Township exceeds that in Ganqu Township, this is not in line with the facts. However, the supply coverage in Fujiachuan Township is so large, and the grain is still so tight. This further illustrates that the phenomenon of grain shortage in rural areas is not caused by a lack of grain or insufficient supply. In fact, those who shout for a lack of grain are indeed some genuinely grain-deficient households, while the majority are not grain-deficient. Some are afraid to show wealth, and some are afraid of disasters and want to buy more grain to prepare for disasters. We have not done enough propaganda and education work for farmers, and there are indeed some shortcomings in our work methods, which are also facts. However, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries take advantage of the weaknesses of farmers as private owners and the shortcomings in our work, stirring up and inciting, trying to sabotage our grain policy and the alliance between workers and peasants, especially in some areas with relatively weak work foundations, such as border areas, it is more serious. All of these are the real causes of the grain shortage in rural areas. This, on the one hand, reflects the contradiction between small peasant economy and socialist planned economy, and on the other hand, it also reflects the complexity and sharpness of class struggle in the transitional period. Many farmers talked to me and enthusiastically supported the state's grain purchase and supply policy, especially the disaster-stricken masses, who were even more grateful. They unanimously told me: "If it were not for the Communist Party and the people's government, implementing the purchase and supply system, such a disaster would have caused how many people to starve to death." They called the grain supply system "three insurance," that is, insurance of having grain, insurance of not increasing prices, and insurance of not being exploited. There were quite a few farmers who did not lack grain but also shouted for a lack of grain, and after the "three fixes" propaganda, they also voluntarily withdrew from the grain purchase certificates. In Yuzhong County, the number of households voluntarily withdrawing from the grain purchase certificates accounted for 12% of the total number of supply households in the county. From this, it can be seen that as long as we continue to correctly implement the grain purchase and supply policy and the "three fixes" method, do a more detailed job of ideological education work, and strike at all counter-revolutionary activities, the phenomenon of grain shortage in some places can be eliminated, and the supply can be more reasonable. And what the farmers ask of us is exactly this.

Regarding the improvement of farmers' living conditions, some people have also expressed doubts. I think this issue should be explained from the following two aspects: on the one hand, the number of middle peasants in rural areas has increased. According to a key survey of seven counties in six districts in Gansu, 80% of the poor peasants at the time of land reform have already risen to become new middle peasants. On the other hand, agricultural production has increased year by year. From 1950 to 1954, the average annual increase was 8.6%. The purchasing power of rural residents in 1954 was more than double that of 1950. In 1949, 100 jin of wheat could only be exchanged for 1.5 zhang of white cloth, now it can be exchanged for 5 zhang. Take the Renhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dingxi County that I visited personally as an example, the whole cooperative had more than 1,000 jin of grain income per person last year. The above all show that since liberation, farmers' living conditions have improved significantly. The saying that farmers' living conditions have not improved, and even seem worse than before liberation, is obviously wrong. In recent years, the people's government has spent a lot of effort to help farmers develop production from all aspects. Just from 1950 to now, the agricultural investment, loans, and rural relief funds in Gansu are equivalent to 110% of the total agricultural tax for the three years from 1952 to 1954. The saying that the state demands a lot and gives little is also not in line with the facts.

From these two issues, I deeply feel that for some things, before the truth and falsehood are not clarified, we should not easily believe; otherwise, it will not only be detrimental to the revolutionary cause but may even be deceived. Especially go to the countryside more often and talk to the masses more, which can help us understand the actual situation more, and this is very beneficial to us.

Efforts to develop agriculture and increase grain production are an important task for Gansu during the first Five-Year Plan. The characteristics of agricultural production in Gansu are that the natural conditions between various regions, such as the height and low of temperature, the amount of rain, the length of the frost-free period, the quality of the land, and the types of crops, are very different. The whole province has eight types of regions, including large-scale water conservancy irrigation areas, arid areas, high mountain rainy areas, plateau hilly areas, pastoral areas, forestry areas, and other areas. In this case, agricultural production is indeed restricted to a certain extent by natural conditions, but the potential for increase has not been fully exploited, and the development prospects are very great. The fundamental way to increase production at present is to carry out the agricultural increase movement with mutual aid as the center. Gansu currently has 6,314 agricultural production cooperatives. According to my understanding of five agricultural production cooperatives, these cooperatives are all well-managed, with old cooperatives increasing production by 15% to 20% last year, and new cooperatives achieving remarkable results in spring plowing and summer production this year. The socialist awareness and enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation of the masses in various places have generally surged. In the future, we should actively develop the agricultural cooperation movement. We plan that by 1957, the number of agricultural households participating in agricultural production cooperatives will reach about 40% of the total number of households; the grain production will be increased by 32% compared to 1952. While carrying out the agricultural cooperation movement, we should also take various effective measures to increase production. In Gansu, we should first develop water conservancy, because most areas in Gansu have less rainfall, the development of water conservancy is a decisive factor for agricultural increase. According to the experience of the past few years, generally, when dry land is converted into water land, the yield can be doubled. Gansu has a large water conservancy potential. Just the water resources of Jiuquan and Wuwei districts, if fully utilized, can turn 10 million mu of barren land into fertile land. Even in arid areas, there are many underground water sources. The masses say: "Three mountains with one mouth, every mouth has water." We should mobilize the power of the masses to use rainwater, surface water, and groundwater as much as possible to develop irrigation. At the same time, we should also carry out comprehensive water and soil conservation work, combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, gradually changing the natural landscape. This work is of great importance to the increase of agricultural production in Gansu and the treatment of the Yellow River. Next, according to the principle of suitability, we should appropriately adjust the distribution area of various types of crops and promote intercropping and relay cropping. The Silver Plain District implemented intercropping this year, and it is estimated that autumn grain can be increased by 30 million jin. In Dingxi and other arid areas, due to the lack of spring rain, the rainfall is concentrated in the autumn, the sowing area of autumn crops should be expanded. In mountainous and grain-deficient areas, more starchy and corn and other high-yield crops should be planted. In Jiuquan, Wuwei, and other areas, in addition to vigorously developing water conservancy to increase grain production, cotton fields can also be developed on a large scale. Preliminary surveys show that these areas have about 4 million mu of land suitable for cotton, with an average yield of about 40 jin per mu. In short, as long as we can adapt to various different regions, correctly take various different measures to increase production, the agricultural production of Gansu can be continuously developed. In this way, not only can we better meet the needs of various aspects, improve the living standards of various ethnic groups, but we can also contribute more strength to the socialist construction of the state.

The realization of the first Five-Year Plan is a great and arduous task. We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in accordance with the state plan, fully carry forward the enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of various ethnic groups, tap the potential of all aspects, work diligently, overcome difficulties, increase production, practice thrift, and ensure the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan!

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    叶季壮部长的发言
    现在我就我国对外贸易的情况向各位代表做一些说明。
    随着我国经济建设发展的需要，我国对外贸易已经有了并且还将有很大的发展。一九五七年我国对外贸易额，预计将比一九五二年增加百分之六十六点五。应当说明，上述五年对外贸易发展的指标，仅仅是控制性的和争取的指标。因为对外贸易是关系我国和外国的事情，不完全决定于我国一方。它的发展，同国内外生产和市场的发展变化，同国际事务关系的增进，是分不开的。同时，我国刚实行计划经济，由于计划一时难于准确，工业和其他方面建设亦常有临时需要，而农产品的出口又常受年成好坏的影响，因而若干进出口商品就不免有提前，推迟、增加、减少等情况发生。因此必须在每一年度内，根据需要和可能，具体加以掌握和调整。总之，我国对外贸易总的趋势是逐年发展的，贸易总额是逐年增加的，但有的年度可能增长较快，有的年度增长较慢，有的年度对某些国家还可能暂时略微缩小，这是完全可以理解的。
    五年计划头两年的进口和出口贸易，大体上是平衡的，而且基本上完成了国家所交给的任务。一九五四年全国进出口金额为人民币八十四亿八千六百七十三万元，进出口货物重量达九百多万吨。这个对外贸易的规模是巨大的，反映出我国经济建设迅速发展的情况。一九五四年进口总额中，工农业生产和其他建设所需的物资（如成套设备、工业器材、工业原料、肥田粉等）占百分之八十八点五，供应人民日常生活需要的物资（如糖、布、纸、医药、煤油等）占百分之十一点五。一九五三年的进口物资比重也大致是这样。这同在国民党统治时期进口生活资料占进口总值百分之五十以上，帝国主义国家用大量奢侈品和消费品倾销我国，以吸取我国财富，阻止我国民族工业发展，使我国长期陷于贫困衰弱地位和依附帝国主义国家的情况，是根本不同的。
    根据五年计划建设的要求，五年内进口的物资，首先是苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项工业建设单位在这个期间所需的设备和重要器材，同时，也要保证进口其他各项工业、交通运输、农林水利等所必需的器材。此外，我们也进口一部分国内不生产或生产不足的轻工业原料和一部分日用生活必需品，以改善和提高人民生活。
    为了保证国家工业化的第一个五年计划的实现，我们必须用出口物资来换回建设所需的进口物资。这即是说，出口是为了进口，进口是为了我国社会主义工业化。因此，组织出口货源，保证出口供应就是直接地有力地支持我国工业建设。但也并不是无限量地出口，而是根据商品对国内市场影响的大小，出口可能和进口需要有分别地予以出口。五年内出口物资的主要部分还是农产品和土产品。
  一九五四年、一九五五年，粮食出口已维持一九五三年的水平，今后两年也打算维持在这个水平上。一九五四年食用植物油出口较一九五三年已减少百分之三十六，今后各年出口打算维持一九五四年的水平。五年内打算增加出口的商品主要是土产品（茶叶、蚕丝、桐油、烟叶、桃仁、杏仁、核桃、草帽辫、薄荷脑、生漆、黄花菜、木耳、各种中药材等）、畜产品（猪、肠衣、皮张、羽毛、羊毛、羊绒等）以及水果、肉类、手工艺品、矿产品等。这些商品增加出口，对我国人民生活的影响是不大的，而对促进我国农村副业和手工业的生产的发展和增加农民、牧民、手工业者的收入却很有利。过去我们对个别商品的出口价格曾一度掌握不当，影响销售。这种现象今后应认真注意避免，使我们的一切出口商品保持合理价格。此外，从去年起，我国若干轻工业品如铁丝、洋钉、针织品、暖水壶、水笔、纱布等开始向外输出，全年输出约值人民币一亿五千万元。这些工业品在东南亚各地受到当地人民和华侨的欢迎。但我国工业品的规格质量还需努力改进，成本还需努力降低。随着我国工业的发展，我国工业产品出口的可能性，也将逐渐增加。
    有人说，目前我们出口的东西是否太多了，以致影响国内市场供应紧张？根据国家建设的需要和经济发展的可能，我国目前各种物资的出口是并不多的。除了粮食和油脂限量出口已见前述外，其他物资像猪肉、鸡蛋、茶叶、丝绸、水果等的出口也并不算多。例如一九五四年猪肉（加上活猪和猪肉罐头）的出口只占国内消费量百分之六，鸡蛋出口占产量百分之十，苹果出口占产量百分之十八，茶叶出口占产量百分之二十七，厂丝出口占产量百分之六十三。有的大宗的出口商品尚未达到战前出口水平，如去年茶叶出口仅及一九三六年出口数量百分之六十五，厂丝出口仅及一九三一年百分之三十二。此外，尚有许多土产品的出口数量未达到战前出口水平。我们是农业国家，对那些同人民生活关系不大的东西，就应当适当节约国内消费，保证出口需要。只要我们每人每月少吃几钱肉，少吃几个鸡蛋，少吃几个水果，就有很大数量可供出口，就可换回大量的机器设备，以支持国家的工业化。何况我们对不少物资在使用上仍有浪费，例如有的单位做了不少牛皮椅子，牛皮沙发，市场上有不少粗制滥造的皮鞋、皮球、皮包、皮面本子，如果认真节约，就有很多皮张可供出口。至于同人民生活没有多大关系的其他东西，更应当尽量组织出口。如果不适当节约国内消费来供应出口，那就会影响我国工业建设所必需的物资的进口，就会影响国家的社会主义工业化。我们都爱我们的祖国，我们不但爱现在的祖国，更爱工业化成功后富强的祖国。我们不仅要重视人民的眼前利益，更要重视人民的长远利益，并使眼前利益服从长远利益。未来的永久的幸福，必须经过现在全国人民一致的艰苦奋斗去争取。
    为了保证出口货源，除适当节约消费而外，还必须发展生产，加强收购工作。我国出口物资的潜力是不小的。五年计划草案中有关茶叶、蚕丝等出口物资的增产已经规定了指标。我国大部分的出口土产品的增产是有很大可能的，应该大力提高单位面积产量，并在不与主要农作物争地的原则下尽量扩大种植面积。对外贸易部门和其他部门出口物资的收购工作，对促进生产的发展有重大的关系。在这方面，几年来曾取得一定的成绩，但我们工作中的缺点和错误还不少。如一九五三年初，由于我们对国内外市场需求的情况预见不足，只看到某些物资的暂时积压，遂对若干出口物资一度采取了调低价格、减少收购的错误措施。虽然基本上已经纠正过来了，但对生产积极性已给了相当的损害。这个教训我们今后一定要经常记着。某些出口商品的收购价格，有时升降幅度过大；对不同地区，不同经济情况给以分别照顾也做得不够。我们现在正根据各地反映的意见，进行研究，以便予以必要的调整，务使农民有利，并乐于积极增产。在收购工作中，历年来在集中产区、集中投售季节，有些地方曾发生过当日不能出售，耽误农民工夫等事情；有些商品的计划方法，也太繁杂。有些商品的收购规格，也规定得有不尽适宜之处，而且在规格要求上，宣传教育工作还做得不够。以上都须继续加以改进。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易是完全建立在平等互利和互助合作的基础上，并根据双方需要与可能进行的。这种新型的国际贸易关系，对促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨有很大作用。通过对外贸易，苏联和各人民民主国家，特别是苏联给我国以巨大的援助。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额增长速度是很快的，如以一九五○年为一百，一九五四年已上升到五百。苏联和东欧各人民民主国家供应我国的货物，绝大部分是工农业生产和其他各方面建设所需的物资，一九五四年苏联和人民民主国家供应我国这些物资的比重高达百分之九十三点九。我国进口的成套设备主要是苏联供应的，其次是东欧各人民民主国家供应的。苏联和东欧各人民民主国家历年供应我国大量的物资，像各种工作母机，矿山、运输和建筑机械，各种钢材，有色金属，电工电讯器材，精密仪器，石油，化工原料等，都是美帝国主义对我国“禁运”的物资，但苏联和人民民主国家以兄弟般友谊满足了我们在生产和建设上的需要。并且这些机器设备和各种物资，在技术上是先进的，在质量上是头等的。苏联和各人民民主国家也供应了我们不少迫切需要的工业原料和生活必需品，如煤油、医药、农药、化工原料、肥田粉、棉花等。在美帝国主义实行“禁运”后，我国许多历来向西方国家出口的物资，都转向苏联和各人民民主国家出口，因而我国许多出口物资几年来也都获得了稳固的销路。近两年来，苏联更接受了我国许多新的出口商品，如罐头、水果、针织品、手工艺品等，这些对促进我国工业、手工艺、农业及其副业的生产的发展，都有重要作用。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家交换的商品，都是按照经过双方商定的公平合理的作价原则来计价的。价格经双方确定后基本上不再变动，只是每年对个别商品的价格进行必要的合理的调整。近几年来，资本主义世界市场价格一直是波动的，但是我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易价格并没有受它的影响，一直保持稳定。这就大大地便利了我国进行计划经济建设。毫无疑问，对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，是保证我国对外贸易正常发展的稳固的可靠的基础。
    我国同东南亚国家的贸易关系，一九五四年有了新的进展。一九五四年我国同缅甸签订了贸易协定和关于缅甸大米同中国出口商品换货议定书，同印度尼西亚签订了贸易议定书及支付协定，同印度签订了贸易协定和烟叶生丝换货协议。我国同锡兰的米胶易货合同，两年多来都在完满地执行着。我国同巴基斯坦的贸易关系也在继续发展。对非洲国家的贸易，我们也正在积极进行。我国同东南亚各国和非洲各国有过共同的经历和境遇，对于这些主张和平、要求经济复兴的国家，我们将进一步同他们在相互尊重国家主权和平等互利的基础上进行经济合作。我们之间的贸易是和平的友好的贸易，贸易双方不要求任何特权。我们深信，发展这种贸易对改善各国人民生活，促进和平共处，增进各国政府之间和人民之间的了解和友谊，均有很大的积极作用。对日本的贸易，近几年来虽然逐步有了发展；但由于日本政府仍在执行美国的“禁运”政策，因此目前的贸易额不但距离战前的水平很远，而且也未恢复到一九五○年的水平。我们希望这种情况有所改变。
    我国同西方国家的贸易，解放后曾一度有过相当的发展。但由于美帝国主义“封锁”“禁运”的阻挠，一九五一年下半年这个市场与我国的贸易额曾经一度下降。但由于我国一贯坚持发展正常国际经济事务关系的政策，和西方国家的许多工商界人士日益体验到采取贸易限制和歧视政策首先而且主要的是对他们不利，因此一九五三年我国与西方国家的贸易额又有了较大的回升。如果他们能够真正采取措施消除妨碍和平贸易的人为障碍，那末，今后我国同他们进一步发展贸易的前途将是巨大的。
    总之，我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，是我国对外贸易的基本部分，但是我国也重视对亚非国家和西方国家的贸易。同时，我们愿意在平等互利和互相尊重主权的原则下，同世界上任何愿意与我国建立经济联系的国家发展贸易往来，而不问其社会制度的差异。过去我们一贯是这样作的，今后也将继续这样作。我们坚决反对妨害世界各国人民利益的“封锁”“禁运”、阻挠航运的贸易歧视政策。但是我们必须着重指出：几年来事实证明，“禁运”政策执行的结果，只是增加了跟随美国“禁运”的那些国家的困难，并没有限制住我国蒸蒸日上的经济建设的发展。
    对外贸易管制和保护贸易政策，保卫了我国独立自主经济的恢复和发展，并使国内私营进出口商不能进行不利于国民经济的投机活动。对这一政策，今后还要继续加以巩固和贯彻。
    对私营进出口商要继续实行利用、限制和改造的政策。一方面对那些有经营能力的正当商户要继续予以维持，使他们有业务可做，有利可得。另一方面对那些没有经营能力、已经瘫痪的进出口商户，实行统一安排的办法，吸收他们的从业人员；对投机走私和抗拒社会主义改造的进出口商户，要及时地适当地予以处理。这样做对职工、对私商、对社会都有好处。
    为了积累工业化所需的资金，对外贸易必须在每个经营环节厉行节约。几年来，国营对外贸易企业的经营管理工作已不断地得到改善。但最近全面检查的结果说明，我们企业经营方面的浪费现象仍然不少，不能不引起我们严重警惕。例如中国粮谷油脂出口公司新河储炼厂，由于缺乏严密的操作规程，使粮油在装卸过程中造成严重的洒、漏现象。洒漏在地上的粮食除了扫起的以外，踩入地内、鸟食、鼠咬、生芽者很多。泵房因对油管处理不当，装船时将棉籽油六百斤全部倾入河内。该厂各种物品，到处乱扔，任凭风吹雨打，工人反映：“我厂职工到处都是脚踏着人民币”。有些单位账目混乱，家底不清。各单位因收购、订货、运输中的错误而造成的损失浪费也不少。贪污现象也有发生。对这些浪费国家资财、不爱护国家资财的现象，我们正在继续检查和分别处理中。上述经营管理工作中存在的问题是同各级领导同志的官僚主义、事务主义分不开的。许多领导同志陷在公文字纸堆里，不能深入下层，许多干部为公文而忙乱，不能钻研业务。经检查，去年本部所收文电中，不必要的抄件达六万八千件之多。我们正结合整编工作，拟定改善经营管理和节约方案，并进行详细核算，准备从行政开支、基本建设投资和各个经营环节上厉行节约，争取在今年内为国家增加收入四千三百万元，节约占用国家资金一亿元，节约行政经费三百八十万元。同时订出了克服官僚主义、事务主义、文牍主义的办法，深入下层，加强实际领导和具体领导。
    在对外贸易部门中，绝大多数工作人员都是好人，他们都勤勤恳恳地工作着，这是对外贸易工作能够取得成绩的主要因素之一。但确实也隐藏着一些伪装进步而实际是同国内外敌人勾结，进行盗窃经济情报、制造差错和其他破坏活动的反革命分子。这些暗藏反革命分子，直到最近才被揭露出来，这说明我们过去政治麻痹和队伍不纯的严重情况。我们正在继续放手发动群众，擦亮眼睛，一定要把暗藏的反革命分子彻底肃清，以保障我国对外贸易队伍的纯洁，使我国对外贸易能够更好地为实现第一个五年计划的经济建设服务。
    对外贸易部门全体工作人员在党中央、毛主席和国务院的领导下，有信心和决心来保证第一个五年计划的胜利完成和一九五五年财政预算的实现。各位代表对我们工作提出的许多宝贵意见，我们诚恳地接受，并注意改进今后的工作。我们的企业机构分布全国，需要各省、市党、政领导加以督促检查，并欢迎各位代表对我们的工作经常给以批评和指正，以鞭策我们的进步。
    茅以升代表的发言
    我们国家的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划是一部高度科学性的文献，是我们全国人民在总路线照耀下的奋斗目标。它向全世界宣布：我们全中国的六亿人民已经在建设社会主义的大道上，大踏步地前进了！我对这个计划的全部内容和李富春副总理的报告，表示衷心的拥护！
    我最近和中国科学院的二十七位学部委员集体往东北视察，看到许多新建、扩建和改建的巨大工程正在紧张地进行，许多建成的企业正在蓬勃地发展。这都是在苏联专家帮助下，工人同志们日夜辛勤劳动的果实，使我们受到很大教育，同时也感到非常兴奋，就好像看到自己的社会主义社会一样，因而对我们国家的社会主义工业化有了更多的体会和更坚强的信心；这就是：在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在伟大的苏联政府和人民的帮助下，通过全国人民的辛勤劳动，我们一定能够完成而且超额完成这第一个伟大的五年计划！
    我们的五年计划是完全符合社会主义的基本经济法则的。伟大的斯大林对这个经济法则作了如下的定义：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。在我们这个计划中，对于整个社会各方面的需要，在五年内，都作了逐年不断增长的指标。因此，对工业、农业、运输、邮电、商业等各方面的生产和流通，在数量和质量上，在五年内，也都作了逐年不断增长的指标，其保证就是在各企业内，劳动生产率的不断提高和生产成本的不断降低。我们怎样能这样不断地提高劳动生产率和不断地降低成本呢？按照上述定义，就是要在高度技术基础上。这里高度二字，我认为是指提高的速度而言，而不是指绝对的水平。只要我们的技术基础是不断地提高，没有停滞不前或间歇倒退的现象，不论我们原有的技术基础是如何薄弱，我们的技术就可以解释为高度的。这样高度技术基础的保证，在我们五年计划中，是已经充分地表现出来了。这就是：对我国广大的自然资源的不断地勘测，对各项企业装备的不断地机械化，以及对建设干部不断地大力培养和对科学研究工作不断地充分发展。因此，我们的五年计划是完全符合社会主义的基本经济法则的。社会主义优越性在我们中国是经过铁的事实，充分证明了的，因而我们的五年计划是一定可以完成而且超额完成的。
    现在我想就我们国家的技术基础方面，提供几点意见。　　为了培养建设干部和技术工人，应当大力发展业余教育，特别是函授教育，这在计划草案和李富春副总理的报告中，是已经特别强调说明了的。干部和工人，不同于青年学生，不但政治锻炼较强，而且有一定的业务知识和经验。对于他们的教育不应采取一般专业学校的程序和方法，犹如教成人识字不同于教儿童识字一样，因为所谓文盲的人，往往仅是盲于字而非盲于文，有了文而学字是比较容易的。因此，干部和工人的业余学习应当紧密地结合到工作任务，从学习业务中的技术理论开始，逐步深入到基础性的自然科学。比如一个掌握了切削技术的车床工人，就应当在学习了车床的构造原理以后，紧接着学习和这些原理有关的数学和物理。从感性认识到理性认识，从知其然到知其所以然。他们学习自然科学不应脱离他们正在进行的工作，而另起炉灶地凭空从数学物理开始。这样先从数学物理的基础科学开始，发展到专业理论再发展到业务技术，是一般学校对青年学生的传统的教育方法，对于干部和工人是很不适宜的。先学业务技术，再学专业理论，最后学基础科学，我认为是完全可能的。在这里，我们还应当大力发展全国性的科学技术的普及宣传工作，作为业余教育的一个有力助手，这在苏联是已经取得了极其伟大的成绩的。
    科学研究工作的重要性，在计划草案和李富春副总理的报告中，都提得非常清楚。培养干部已经是件缓慢的工作，科学研究的发展就需要更长久的时间，因为科学的提高是要建筑在科学普及的基础上的。然而五年计划对于科学研究的要求，和对干部培养一样，是非常迫切的，我们必须采取适当措施来消除这个矛盾。（1）充分发挥现有科学研究机构中人力物力的作用，避免重复浪费、加强薄弱环节，并在研究工作人员中树立经济核算思想。（2）牢固地建立科学研究为生产服务的制度，确定每个研究机构服务的对象，加强各研究机构间的联系，使研究工作的配合与协调和企业生产的配合与协调相适应，共同努力提高劳动生产率并降低成本。（3）使科学研究机构为企业中的技术革新者开门，使他们能在科学研究的环境中，完成他们的技术革新工作。（4）使高等学校的研究工作，通过教学，仍然表现为生产建设服务。（5）扩大自然科学各专门学会的学术活动，来配合生产中的研究工作，并使各学会工作能在生产、教育和研究的三方面联系中起它一定的桥梁作用。（6）使各企业中的创造发明及合理化建议同各有关的科学研究工作联系起来，做成许多专业性的科学工作网，再把这些网组织成为全国性的科学研究网。我们要把科学研究工作扩大到和爱国卫生运动的规模一样，来保障五年计划中所有企业生产的技术健康。
    我们全体科学技术人员在五年计划中的任务，是十分艰巨的。除了加强我们每个人的岗位工作，来提高我们的技术基础以外，我们应当大力支援关于解放台湾的一切工作，来恢复我们的领土主权，从而扩大我们经济建设的自然资源和技术基础。我们还应当经常参加肃清一切反革命分子的工作，通过阶级斗争的胜利，来保障我们五年计划的成果。让我们全体科学技术工作者，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，逐一地加速完成几个五年计划，为把我们祖国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗到底！
    朱德海代表的发言
    我完全同意并拥护国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任李富春代表国务院所作的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念代表国务院所作的“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”及国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀所作的“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”。在听了这些报告以后，使我进一步明确了第一个五年计划的主要内容及我国在过渡时期全国各族人民为实现五年计划而奋斗的任务。同时，对于五年计划在基本建设方面的重点建设方针，在生产上的统筹兼顾的方针，国民经济各部门之间必须按比例地发展以及在社会主义改造问题上必须积极稳步地前进等问题有了进
  一步的认识和体会。第一个五年计划的实现和完成，将为我国的社会主义工业化打下初步的基础，开始改变我国百年来经济落后的历史面貌；促进我国各少数民族经济、文化事业的进一步发展，把我国向着工业化的社会主义社会的目标推进一步。随着这个计划的实现，我国各族人民的物质文化生活水平将要逐步地得到改善和提高。因此，这个计划是完全符合全国各族人民的长远利益和最高利益的，我们吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区的各族人民衷心地拥护这个计划，并要为实现和完成这个计划而努力奋斗。
    解放后几年以来，延边朝鲜族自治区在中国共产党、上级人民政府和毛主席的领导下，经过了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命和“三反”、“五反”运动，特别是由于贯彻了毛主席的伟大的民族政策，推行了区域自治，极大地鼓舞了延边地区各族劳动人民群众在劳动战线上的高度的积极性和创造性，因而到一九五三年延边地区的国民经济已得到了全面的恢复和部分的发展，并有可能与全国其他地区一道，在一九五三年开始进入有计划地进行经济建设的阶段。
    延边朝鲜族自治区是一个以农业生产为主的地方，发展经济的重点应该是农业生产。因此，我们必须按照第一个五年计划的总精神和规定，大力做好农业增产的工作。李富春副总理在“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”中指出：“农业生产供应全国人民的食粮，同时，用农产品作原料的工业产品，在目前又占全国工业总产值的百分之五十以上，而且进口工业设备和建设器材所需要的外汇，大部分也是农产品出口换来的。因此，发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。”这就十分清楚地说明了发展农业生产对于完成我国第一个五年计划和在建设社会主义事业中的重要意义。为了发展农业生产，延边地区按照上级党和政府的指示，在积极领导，稳步前进的方针下，自一九四八年起即在农村开展了互助合作运动。到一九五五年春耕之前，全区参加农业生产合作社的户数，占总农户的百分之五十二点三强。此外组织到各种互助组里的农户，占总农户的百分之四十左右。到一九五七年底，参加农业生产合作社的农户，全区可能达到总农户的百分之七十左右。
    由于延边是一个多民族地区，在领导农业生产和互助合作运动中，我们注意了发展多民族（主要是朝鲜族和汉族）结合的农业生产合作社，这样的社，不仅在劳动力上能够互相帮助，在生产技术上取长补短，交流经验，达到增加生产的目的；而且在共同劳动的基础上，还日益增进和加强了民族团结，这种民族联合的农业生产合作社，已成为我们今后发展农业生产合作社的方向。
    另外，由于延边地区森林面积很大，我们还在因地制宜的原则下，组织了农业和林业相结合的农林合作社。对于这类农林合作社，今后要注意积累经验，以便在林业地区逐步地推广。
    其次，农村的供销、信贷合作事业也有了相应的发展。目前，在全自治区建立基层供销合作社二百零二个，拥有社员三十三万七千四百九十五名。资金一千零七十四万四千九百零五元，基本上保证了农民生产资料和生活资料的供应。
    自一九五四年以来，逐步把原来附设在农村供销合作社里的信贷部改建为信贷合作社。现在全区共建立一百一十二个农村信用合作社，还有两个信用部，股金共有三十七万二千零零五元；流动资金二百六十四万四千四百一十九元。
    生产、供销、信贷合作事业的发展和一九五三年以来实行的粮食统购统销政策，使农村资本主义自发势力生长的可能性大大缩小，为增产粮食，和完成对个体农业的社会主义改造开辟了广阔的道路。
    在农村互助合作运动发展的基础上，我们还采取了并将继续采取下列各种增产粮食的措施：鼓励农民精耕细作，改良农业生产技术，以提高单位面积产量；奖励农民开垦小块荒地，以扩大耕地面积；兴修水利，防止水旱灾害，避免农作物的减产以及奖励农民改旱田为水田，增加稻米生产，等等。
    由于在过去的两年中，延边地区遭遇到历史上少有的、不可抗拒的灾害，所以全区粮食的总产量较一九五二年有所减少。但如上所述，我们在开展农村互助合作运动，改进农业生产技术等方面已取得了一定的成绩。这证明了上级党和政府的政策是完全正确的。
    按照五年计划的要求，如果没有特殊严重的灾荒，我们是有信心可以完成并超额完成粮食增产计划的。
    几年来，我们在农业生产工作上所业已取得的成绩，都是同中国共产党、上级人民政府和毛主席的正确领导和亲切关怀，同时也是同广大的干部、群众的积极努力和支持分不开的。但是，由于我们的水平不高，努力不够，在我们的工作中还存在着不少的缺点和错误。首先，表现在对农业进行社会主义改造的问题上，未能很好地贯彻积极领导、稳步前进的方针，有时冒进，有时保守；其次，在推广农业生产先进经验和搞丰产田问题上，也表现了不是实事求是，因地制宜，相反地是存在着一定程度的机械搬运别的地区的经验的毛病。所有上述这些缺点，必须在今后的工作中大力地加以克服和纠正。
    关于延边朝鲜族自治区除农业生产以外，其他各项工作，几年来也都取得了一定的成绩，并都存在着不少缺点和错误，我就不在这里详细的说明了。
      我国的第一个五年计划是一个伟大的计划，它的实现和完成，将使我国变得更加繁荣和强大，它将给我国各少数民族带来无限光明和幸福的前途。在实现第一个五年计划的斗争中，我们少数民族人民担负着光荣而重大的责任，我们必须在中国共产党、上级人民政府和毛主席的领导下，进一步地加强民族团结，同心协力，增加生产，厉行节约，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗，克服困难的优良传统；更加提高革命警惕性，防止和肃清一切反革命分子的破坏活动，来完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，保证社会主义在我国的胜利。
    李明灏代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告和彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    去年沿江地区，与洪水灾害作斗争所取得的伟大胜利，对保障国家经济建设起了重大作用。湖北省是沿江重灾省之一，大家对湖北省的救灾工作一直是很关心的。我现在就湖北省一年来的生产救灾工作发言。
    湖北省去年夏季，遭受了有水文记载以来百年仅有的大洪水。全省人民同洪水进行了史无前例的、英勇顽强的斗争，确保了荆江大堤、汉水北大堤和武汉市、黄石市等工业城市的安全，把灾害减少到最低限度。各地党政领导机关及广大农村干部，都以战斗姿态、不分昼夜风雨，领导和组织灾区群众向非灾区转移。随着水退，我们又领导和组织灾民还乡，重建家园。及时调运了大批粮食、修房材料、煤炭、木柴和油、盐，解决了灾民吃、住的困难。同时，领导灾民堵口排水，抢种了一千二百零九万亩晚秋和冬播作物，并开展了副业生产。
    受灾地区正在进行紧张的恢复工作，从去年十一月下旬起，又接连遭受两次寒潮大雪的袭击。平地雪深一尺到三尺。全省除长江干流外，河、湖全部结冻，汉水中冻住轮船六十多只，许多木船被冰挤毁，水陆交通顿时断绝，这也是历史上所罕见的。在这种情况下，我们和防汛抢险时期一样的紧急动员起来，本着中央“救人第一”的精神，立即组织了各级干部八千多人，涉冰河、冒风雪，深入乡村进行紧急抢救。为了及时恢复交通，保证灾区的物资供应，动员了群众五十多万人，沿公路铲冰扫雪，用炸药炸开了汉水航道，组织了全省的运输力量，将粮食、柴草等物资源源运到灾区。发放了棉衣、棉裤一百五十余万件，棉被九万余床，突击抢修了房屋一百六十多万间，发放了口粮救济、房屋补助、耕牛饲料等款项共三千一百六十三万余元，保证了灾区人民安全渡过寒冬。
    大水加上大雪，这就造成了今年的严重春荒，和春耕生产的巨大困难。为了帮助灾民渡过春荒，顺利地进行春耕生产，我们除继续发放了大批救济粮款外，从省内外调剂、收购运往灾区的耕牛达五万零五百余头；从江苏、四川等七省及本省非灾区采购调运到灾区的种籽一亿八千九百七十九万斤，并对无力购买种籽的困难户，发放了种籽贷款七百五十万元。此外，还大量供应和修补了灾民的农具。由于这些努力，保证了灾区春耕生产计划的胜利完成。与此同时，兴修了规模巨大的堵口复堤工程，完成土方约七千万公方，使今后防范水灾有了比较可靠的保证。
    各位代表：一年来，严重的自然灾害被我们战胜了。这样伟大的胜利，是历史上所未有的。正如灾区农民所说：“百年未有的大洪水，千年未有的好政府”。这首先应当归功于中央和毛主席的亲切关怀和英明领导；归功于全国各地的大力支援。中央曾多次给我们指示，先后拨给我们救济款一亿零七百多万元，各种贷款和棉花预购款共二千多万元；从中央卫生部门和贵州、广东等省抽调大批医务人员，协助我省灾区医疗卫生工作。灾区人民说：“水有好大，力量就有好大，要什么，有什么，毛主席领导的新中国，像一家人一样。”回忆在国民党反动统治下的一九三一年，武汉市水位涨到二十六公尺多的时候，就溃堤淹水，全市被淹达四个月之久，在洪水进市的三、四天内，即打捞起浮尸一千多具，据伪政府记载，当时武汉市急待赈济的
  “已逾五十万人”。仅在龟山、洪山几个“千人坑”中，即掩埋了饿死、病死的灾民三万二千六百多人。从这两次水灾的鲜明对比中，充分表现了在共产党和人民政府的领导下，人民的力量是多么伟大；如果没有以工人阶级为领导的人民民主制度、没有中央和毛主席对灾区人民的高度关怀、没有全国人民团结一致的支援，我们湖北人民所遭遇的灾害将是很难设想的。
    其次，国家对农业的社会主义改造，特别是粮食统购统销政策的贯彻执行，给生产救灾工作创造了极为有利的条件。人民政府从四川等十四个省及本省非灾区调运粮食二十亿斤，供应灾区群众。灾区普遍设有专船运销粮食，汛期，做到了灾民到那里，供应到那里。大雪期间，各地一般都采取了干部背粮下乡、送货上门及冰上划船或肩挑运输等办法，将大批粮食运到灾区；汉川、沔阳等十三个重灾县，在一个月内即运到粮食八亿三千余万斤。汉川县全县在风雪期中，平均每天有两百多人送粮下乡。应城县三个区增加了三十六个流动供应组，送粮上门。当群众在大雪围困中，吃到政府从四川、广东等省运来的廉价大米时，感动地说：“国家的粮食统购统销政策，真是救命政策！”由于粮食统购统销政策的贯彻执行，才保证了灾区的粮食供应无缺，稳定了灾区物价，保障了灾民生活（国家在灾区售粮，共亏损了一千零二十七万元）。据我们在武昌二区范湖乡所看到的情况是：家家吃白米干饭，满园蔬菜吃不完，猪、牛、鸡、犬齐全，男女劳动力都下田耕作，家无闲人。如果不是房子因以大改小，较为简陋，几乎看不出这里曾遭过大水灾。
    再次，广大的区、乡干部和积极分子，在防汛救灾工作中，始终都坚持地站在斗争最前列，以爱护群众、英勇沉着、艰苦奋斗的高贵品质和革命英雄主义精神，领导群众，创造出无数可歌可泣的事迹。在防汛抢险斗争中，他们有的以身堵口，有的舍己救人。沔阳县八潭乡财粮委员易烈钧，在禹王宫分洪时，不顾自己的家人和财物，一夜抢救出十七户革命军人家属和工作人员家属。共产党员贾明武，舍身抢护下水道漏洞大险，英勇牺牲。在灾民转移过程中，灾区基层干部与灾民同吃、同住、同行，替灾民挑东西、抱小孩、找房子、烧茶饭，灾民到那里，干部到那里，负责带出去，负责带回来，保证了灾民转移中的安全。在寒潮大雪期间，许多干部日夜不停地挨门逐户查灾慰问，送口粮、发寒衣，并替革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和孤、老、病、残户扫雪、修房，使他们免受冻馁。因此，群众反映：“毛主席教育出来的干部，真正做到了雪里送炭！”广大区乡干部与灾民群众同甘苦、共患难，团结群众，形成一个巨大的力量，战胜了自然灾害。
    现在，湖北省人民正在进行着新的防汛斗争。根据过去的经验和水文气象情况的预测，我们完全相信：有中央和毛主席的英明领导，以及全国人民的支援，再加上我们全省党、政、军、民的一致努力，一定可以战胜今年的洪水，争取丰收，完成农业增产计划，来支援国家工业化，来支援解放台湾。
    沈德建代表的发言
    我完全拥护我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案，并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    祖国已经走上了社会主义的光辉灿烂的道路，社会主义建设的曙光，照亮了一切角落。一切有利于社会的人民，一切有利于社会的学术，都正在发挥增进人类和平幸福的作用。长久被资产阶级轻视的中医，同样地也获得了共产党和人民政府的重视。由于我过去多年来经常不断的涉猎中国医学，由于我过去多年来经常不断地运用中国医学治疗贫穷病人，又由于我过去多年来常常看到中国医学遭受资产阶级轻视的事实，所以，虽然我的医学知识很浅陋，虽然我因自己医学知识浅陋而从来不曾做过职业医生，虽然我仅是一个医学研究者，可是，今天欢欣鼓舞的情绪，无法抑制我自己对于中医问题的发言。
    中国医学的特点，不仅是因为它有数千年的悠久历史，也不仅是因为它有两千多种的有效药物，更不仅是因为它有针灸、按摩、推拿、导引各种的治疗方法；而是因为在二千多年以前，中国医学就能够发现了人类生存在自然界中的健康规律和危害健康的因果关系。例如，气温的过冷过热，气压的过高过低，空气的过干过湿，饮食的过饥过饱，排泄的过多过少，身体的过静过动，脑力的过忙过闲，睡眠的过久过暂，情绪的过苦过乐，都可以随各人的生理和生活的不同情况，而不知不觉地影响了健康。中国医学，对于这些原因所发生的疾病，早就有了丰富而正确的说明；并且还说明了这些疾病发生的现象，首先表现在自觉的能的失常，而后逐渐发展在客观的质的变态。特别重视的问题，是在热量的消长不平衡和分布不平衡的现象，以及体液的消长不平衡和分布不平衡的现象。因此又肯定了若干疾病的演变及其后果的自然规律，而组织了若干系列的症候公式，作为诊断和治疗的标准；而后灵活运用各种药物或非药物的各种治疗方法，以调整机体内在的不平衡，或恢复本能应有的抗病力。因为中国医学对于健康的观点，既根源于身体内在各部分相互间的平衡性，又根源于身体与外界的统一性，所以对于疾病的观点，就根源于内在机能相互间的矛盾，和身体与外界的矛盾。于是治疗的法则，就着眼在如何恢复平衡及如何恢复统一，而从来不重视百病通治的治标方法，也从来不重视某症特效的治标药物。“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”，这两句批评不会治病的医生的古代俗话，至今还流传在民间。三十多种不同原因的头痛症状，在中医就有三十多种不同处理的根本医疗。关键就在病理要通达，诊断要正确。诊断没有把握的医生，只好采用“头痛医头”，临时应付的治标办法。例如，桂枝是寒症头痛的必效药，如果诊断错误而用在暑症头痛的病人，必将发生鼻血不止或头脑血管破裂而致死亡的后果。原因就在原来已经有了矛盾，再因桂枝更增加了矛盾。由于矛盾而发生疾病的观点，又发现了还有某些疾病，不必运用医药治疗，也可能因休养或因食物而自然恢复健康。如何休养如何饮食的各种有医疗作用的方法，在中国医学书籍中，也早就有着丰富的说明。从理论根源上看中国医学，中国医学是有着以平衡统一作理论基础的，而且又经过数千年临床经验作实践证明的医学，这应该看作是中国医学的特点。
    无论在整理中医或研究中医的工作上，如果脱离了这个特点，而只注意某项药物某个技术在某个病例治疗上的效果问题，这就是等于扬弃了中国医学的基本内容，是等于割断了中国医学的历史事实，是等于把中国医学看作是许多支离破碎凑合的东西，是等于以研究物理化学的观点和方法对待中国医学所包含的个别的若干孤立问题。当然，这样个别的问题，也是值得研究的，不过，首先要注意的是，应该在中国医学本身特点的前提领导之下来进行工作。如果忽略了这个特点而仅仅注意在若干个别问题的工作，必将不可能了解中国医学的全部面貌和基本精神，而且在短期间内，也不容易有很大的收获。例如，本草纲目这部书所记载的药物是两千六百零八种，假定每一年度能够完成五种药物治疗效用的研究工作，就得需要五百多年。虽然可能获得某些对症治疗的有效成绩，但对于中国医学的整个体系和基本内容，毕竟没有贯通和联系的可能。例如，苦参子治阿米巴痢有特效，事实已经证明了确实和西药的药特灵（YATREN）完全相同。但历代中医治痢的方法，每随各种不同的病因和症状，运用各种不同的方法来增强肠的抗病机能；而苦参子在中医方面，每用在制约某些内分泌机能抗进的病症，反从来不用在肠病范围。又例如，针灸治疗不过是中国医学多种治疗方法中间的一种，并非治疗一切疾病的万能方法。诊断正确的针灸治疗，效果是相当大的，但是，如果没有通过中国医学的正确诊断，或不当针灸而误用了针灸方法，或应当针灸而误用了针灸位置，这些不良的后果，也是相当大的。疾病的治疗方法，是否应该针灸，是否应该用药物或用其他方法，其问题必须根据中国医学整个理论体系来决定，就是说必须依靠正确诊断才可以决定，决非病人只凭自己感性所能选择的问题。也就是说，如果用物理机械观点，对待病灶，就是脱离了病理的整个体系。在中国医学的治疗效果上，一切疾病的治疗，妇女有时不如男人容易见效的原因，可能就是由于医学整个理论体系对于妇女的生理和病理，原来就不够周全。在过去封建统治时期，中国妇女既从来不可能有过研究医学的机会；因体会所创造的医学论据，既历来就是男人，而积累的临床经验，又绝大多数都是男人的病例。因此中国医学的运用，就有时不能完全符合妇女疾病的演变规律和治疗要求。所以关于妇女病理和治疗方法，应该在原有的整个理论体系的基础上进行研究和充实。从这些简单说明，可以看出中国医学在临床运用上，病理、诊断和治疗，都是整体的全面的。从这些简单说明，更可以看出中国医学在学术内容上，所包括的生理学，病理学，诊断学，治疗学，药物学，养生学等等，乃至治疗学范围内所包括的针灸学，按摩学，推拿学，导引学等等，彼此之间，都是统一的，相互联系的，同一理论根源的，不可分割的，不可孤立的。我们祖先数千年积累下来的数千部医书，无论在理论上在方法上，虽都已随着时代变迁有了陆续的扩充和发展，但全部内容，都是整套的，先后统一的，古今相联系的。所以今后中国医学的整理工作和研究工作，无论在任何一个科目方面，都应该照顾到全套医学原来的整体性。不可否认，中国医学也有它的若干缺点，我们应该剔除虚玄附会的部分，清理正确切实的部分，才可以保持中国医学本身原来的基本特点，才可以发挥中国医学本身原来的经验效能，才可以在这个基础上，计划教学方法，编订中医教材，兴办中医学校。再进一步结合现代自然科学，逐步改进药物方面的剂形剂量，充实诊断方面的检查方法等等工作。总而言之，凡一切由现代科学产生的医药学术，不但应该充分吸收，而且在批判清理中国医学过程中，还能够发挥权衡取舍的校正作用。
    从古典到科学，从博大到精微，这一系列的中国医学的工作，换一句话说，就是从整理到提高。这正是过去多年全国中医师的普遍要求，也就是中国学术界从来没有过的极伟大的事业。人民政府对于中医的正确政策，将动员全国中医师共同参加这种伟大的事业。每一个中医师当然感觉到无限兴奋和无限光荣。但工作是非常细致的非常复杂的而且非常艰难的，特别是从整理到提高这一系列的工作过程，必将随时出现学术上许多问题不易解决的困难，由于过去中医师学习环境所形成的条件限制，今后必须亲密地靠拢以科学为基础的西医，多从西医学习，多得西医帮助，才可以完成这个光荣而重大的任务，才可以创造一个古今统一、中外统一的医学，才可以使中国医学对人类将有更大的贡献。同是为人类健康服务的医师们和医学家们，在身份名称上，原不应该还有中医西医的分歧；同是为人类健康服务的中国医学和外国医学，在学术方法上，更不应该还有中医西医的派别。解放以后，全国卫生事业的发展，已经大大地提高了人民的健康水平。人民又因卫生知识的提高，对于健康的要求，也比从前更加迫切，更加广泛。为着满足人民对于健康的要求，为着适应国民经济建设的需要，中西医必须在共产党和人民政府的领导下团结起来，亲密合作，更好地为人民的健康服务。
    胡厥文代表的发言
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，并愿为我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的实施而奋斗。
    我是学习机械工程的，也从事于资本主义机器制造工业的经营的。当远在年纪不很大的时候，看见火车轮船，就感觉到没有机器，国家是不可能强大的，后来听见了“实业救国”的说法，也是心向往之。我的学习和从事机械工程，倒不是单纯从兴趣出发的，但是，当时根本上不懂得根据历史发展的必然规律，中国绝不可能走资本主义工业化这条道路的道理。几十年来，我经营的企业在帝国主义和官僚资本主义双重的压迫下，在资本主义盲目经营法则的支配下，一向在艰难困苦的处境当中，我和厂内的职工同志们虽也共同努力，钻研技术，但是在一个困难接着一个困难的情形之下，到解放前夕，已经是奄奄一息，所谓“实业救国”真是在做梦。这也是半殖民地、半封建的旧中国研究技术的民族资产阶级的共同遭遇。解放初期，我们的企业就绝大部分接受了国家的定货，去年又获得批准了公私合营，改进了生产经营，克服了困难，发挥了有利于国计民生的积极作用，非常愉快。毛主席说过：
  “没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”今天国家要在国民经济已经恢复的基础上，实行发展以工业建设为中心的国民经济的第一个五年计划，实现了全国人民长期以来的共同愿望。也就证明：只有走向社会主义工业化的道路，才能把贫弱的中国变成真正富强的中国。在这样一个伟大计划的面前，我们内心的兴奋是可以理解的。
    李副总理在报告中指出：“社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是优先发展重工业。”“优先发展重工业的政策，是使国家富强和人民幸福的唯一正确的政策”。而且五年内工业生产计划的完成，大部分还要依靠原有的企业，这样，从事重工业建设的人们，在第一个五年计划中分担的任务是艰巨而光荣的。因此，重视原企业的生产工作，充分发挥它们的潜在力量，争取超额完成生产计划是完全必要的。针对目前普遍存在着的产品种类少、质量低、成本高等等现象，就需要在企业中大力改进技术，提高产品质量，消灭废次品，试制新产品，这里面有一个关键性的问题必须首先加以解决的，就是产品的规格标准问题，因为重工业品质的不良，是可以妨碍到一切的工业产品的。倘不依严格的规格标准，而随便减低成本，则接近偷工减料，倘不依规格标准而只顾增加生产，则等于制造废品，是不堪设想的。应当在奖励先进、照顾多数、推动落后的前提下，订定规格，必须在可以适应国内现在可能达到的条件之下，订定一个最低标准，另一个就是国际最高标准。凡产品不能符合于最低标准的，就要作为废品，不予使用；而最高标准则为大家共同努力争取的目标。只有最高标准，而没有最低标准，则母机问题、技术问题、原料问题均有困难，势必高不可攀，无从着手；只有最低标准，则大家满足于固有的成绩，停滞不前，永无进步。所以，最低标准应该实事求是，逐步提高，有步骤的来改善品质，这是符合实际的。
    机器制造工业是对国民经济进行技术改造的主导力量。机器产品尺寸必须准确，材料必须优良，名称必须统一。因此，在机器工厂较多的地区设立标准量具检验所，以校准精密的尺寸；建立特种钢材的钢厂，以制炼适应的钢材，并对各种机器、机件定出全国性的统一名称是完全必要的。
    各位代表：我们现在有中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导，又有苏联和各人民民主国家的无私援助，我们所处的时代是十分伟大的，我们在五年计划中所分担的任务是很艰巨而光荣的，我们大家应当很愉快地、忠诚地团结起来，克服困难，增加生产，为完成第一个五年计划作出贡献。
    其次，在大会中间听了邓子恢副总理关于根治和开发黄河的综合规划的报告，知道我国数千年来未能治理的黄河为害问题，已经计划能够在五年后可以看到黄河水清，几十年内便能根本治好，对于大量运输、广大灌溉和巨量发电能力，都可以取得史无前例的伟大成就。这样的大喜讯一个胜似一个地接踵而来，在今天做一个毛泽东时代的中华人民共和国人民，为什么不跟着国家而进步呢？我们每一个中国人，必须厉行节约，节省每一个能节省的资金来支援国家的伟大计划。尤其应当提高警惕，肃清要处心积虑来破坏我们建设的反革命特务分子！
    李承干代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理及彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    这些报告，我们各小组都曾进行了学习，特别是对于李富春副总理的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和有关文件，学习得更深入，在讨论时，还请了政府有关部门来对一些问题作了说明或解答。我深深地了解到，第一个五年计划对于轻工业和重工业的比重、工业农业和文教卫生交通各种建设的配合、工业地区的分布、大中型企业的安排，都是很科学的、规模很大的，而且是符合宪法上所规定的国家在过渡时期的总任务。我又看到一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算，知道一九五四年的预算执行得很好，一九五五年的预算编制亦是符合于第一个五年计划的。至于邓子恢副总理的“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，则使我明了，这一规划的实施，不独将根治了几千年为害中国人民的黄河水害，而且将使它成为人民之利的河流，这真是世界上少见的伟大建设。所有这一切，都使我感到社会主义的美景十分明显地呈现在我的眼前。全国人民应该提高警惕，肃清一切反革命分子，厉行节约，反对浪费，为完成国家的社会主义建设而奋斗。
    第一个五年计划指出：“统一全国度量衡；建立量具和计器定期校正制度和统一的产品检验制度”为实现工业生产计划的必要措施之一。这是与我最近被派担任在国家机关中的工作——国家计量局有密切关系的，我愿就此事说一说。国家计量局成立于今年五月，目前还只有两个月。它是由中央工商行政管理局的度量衡处扩展而来的。它的方针任务，目前虽然还在研究讨论尚待呈请批准中，但它的工作是要学习苏联则是无问题的。这里摘引苏联列昂诺夫和卡茨曼两人所著的苏联国家权度工作一书中的一些论点，以供参考：
    “任何工作，无论是工厂、科学研究、集体农庄、企业部门、机关或其它组织中，均须使用计量器具。它能保证各个生产程序的正确组织和执行，保证企业的产品质量、另件互换和进行流水式生产法。在国防事业中，保证武器不发生故障，机件和弹药的正确配合，均与制造修理中所用计量器具的准确有着直接的关系。对经济核算、产品计算的作用也很大。总之，人们的日常生活离不开计量器具，如测定时间的钟表，购买物品的度器和衡器，计算瓦斯和电量的表件，医疗器械以及交通运输和电信，等等。
      “不正确的计量器具和计量方法，会给国家带来损失，例如造成废品、浪费原材料，使机件修理工作复杂化并提高其修理费用，甚至造成重大事故。
    “为了实现以上目的，要求设立计量科学研究机关，进行各种计量单位基准器的建设，拟定各种计量方法和实施计量器具的国家试验；同时设立计量技术操作机关，进行系统的检定监督工作。”
    从上述论文所介绍的苏联的情况，我们可以知道，计量局的工作，不单是管理普通常用的尺、斗、秤，而是要保证一切量具和计器的准确性、一致性和正确使用，从而做到“保证产品质量，另件互换和进行流水式生产法”。因此，这个工作是与社会主义工业化极密切地关联着的。
    我国的度、量、衡制度是极为混乱的，目前统一度量衡实是一件迫不及待的事，而在这一问题解决之前须决定的则是以什么制度来统一的问题。在国家计量局成立之前，中央工商行政管理局曾多次召集有关部门会议，对于以国际公制（即米突制）为统一我国度量衡的制度，废除市尺、市斤、市升和地方性的旧杂制，都一致赞同，因为国际公制是最科学的制度，世界各国包括苏联和人民民主国家，都已采用，我国亦早已非正式采用，以公制来统一我国的度量衡制度，是很适合的。惟公制的各单位的中文命名，以往国民党反动政府所定名称，极不科学，应有所改变。目前国家计量局的工作在联合各有关机关和团体商议公制命名法，先行呈请上级批准公布，再拟定在全国内统一度量衡的具体办法，呈请批示后予以实施。同时为了提高和统一对量具和计器的检定工作（目前已设立度量衡检定所或站的，在全国已有二百三十个城市，检定范围已有：长度、衡器、量器、力学、热学等方面）以应人民的迫切需要，建立国家基准器和各地方的标准器，亦成为即须考虑的问题。
    在六亿人口的国家进行统一度量衡和实施精密计量器具的国家检定是一项相当复杂和艰巨的工作。我们的机构成立还不久，我自己对这个工作的经验很少，实感责任重大。但我愿本着为人民服务的精神，在上级领导之下，以苏联为师，边学边做，使国家的计量工作，早日走上轨道，以适应国家的社会主义工业化的要求。尚望政府各有关部门和社会团体及全国人民代表大会代表们在各方面予以协助。
    李德全部长的发言
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，十分认真地审议了我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和一九五四年国家财政决算和一九五五年预算，并听了彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于兵役法草案的报告和邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，这些计划和报告中所反映的成绩和所提出的任务在中国历史上都是没有先例的，是现代中国人民生活中极其重大的事件。可惜我因出席洛桑世界母亲大会，没有来得及参加这次大会的全部讨论和学习，是我个人很大的损失。但是这并未减轻我对这些伟大的议题所激起的振奋的心情。因此，当世界母亲大会结束以后，我就急忙地赶回来参加这个具有伟大历史意义的议题的讨论。我切盼这些伟大计划的彻底实现，这对于提高全国人民物质生活和文化生活水平，保障世界和平都有重大的意义。我认为我们国家的第一个五年计划，是使我们国家胜利地走向社会主义社会第一个阶梯。而第一个五年计划中所追求的目标已经不是什么遥不可达的理想，而是摆在我们面前的建设实践中迫切的任务。我认为这个计划不是空想的，而是切实可行的。是符合今天全国人民需要的。我本人衷心同意这个计划，愿为它的实现而努力。
      一九四九年中华人民共和国成立，中国的革命开始了新的历史时期，即在我国建设社会主义国家的过渡时期。在建国的前三年，经过重大努力，我们的经济已恢复到战前水平，许多生产已超过战前水平，人民民主政权更加巩固了，抗美援朝取得了伟大胜利，土地改革胜利完成了，物价稳定了，这些为大规模的经济建设作好了准备。从一九五三年开始进行了改变国家面貌的第一个五年计划，一九五四年召开了第一届全国人民代表大会的第一次会议，公布了我国的宪法，这些都充分说明我国在各项工作上的胜利进展，全国人民都在为过去几年来的工作成绩而欢呼鼓舞。同时也充满信心地为建设社会主义共和国而忘我地劳动着。这些成绩是由中国共产党和毛主席领导的正确，才能获得的。
    但是，过去国际和国内的经验也告诉我们，帝国主义者和国内的反动势力决不甘心看着中国人民过着和平幸福的日子。他们除了公开的武装的进攻外，还想尽各种各样卑鄙的特务手段，从各个方面来进行破坏。潘汉年及胡风反革命集团的事实，都证明着这个道理。也说明随着社会主义建设的发展，革命与反革命的斗争，也要日趋尖锐而复杂化。他们有拿枪的，也有不拿枪的，明的、暗的，只要他们想得出来的坏主意，他们就会去做，因为他们是仇恨中国人民的。他们具有各种各样的反革命纲领，也用各种不同的面目和手法。他们伪装进步，却在暗中“磨自己的剑”、“窥测方向”。不肃清这些隐藏在人民内部的反革命分子，人民民主专政就不能巩固，国家建设就会遭到破坏。我完全拥护政府逮捕潘汉年、胡风的措施，并请依法加以审讯法办。
    为了配合国家经济建设，卫生部曾于去年五月召开了工业卫生会议，讨论改进工业卫生工作。卫生部与有关部门配合，加强了业务领导，输送了一批卫生干部到工矿中去，充实了工矿的医疗预防力量，对职工危害最大的多发病与职业病，根据不同情况，分别急缓采取了相应的措施，如对高温、粉尘、有害气体的防止，以及胃肠病、妇女病等多发病都进行了一些工作。在农村，如何面向农业生产，如何进一步开展爱国卫生运动，防治传染病，如何开展农业生产合作社的医疗保健工作，全国各地已有不少经验，我们正在进一步加以研究。去年夏季长江流域大雨成灾，卫生部曾组织大批医务人员，到灾区工作。只湖北、安徽两省即组织了两万余名医务人员并调配了大量的药品，同蔓延的疾病进行了艰巨的斗争。
    过去中央卫生部在许多工作上存在严重的缺点和错误，中医问题是一个显著的例子。中国目前还有约几十万的中医，是卫生队伍中一支巨大的力量，是关系着六亿人口保健事业的极为重要的问题。中医对许多疾病，确有良好的疗效，几千年来我们积累了许多治病的经验，可是在卫生部门中却有些负责人认为中医“不科学”，对中医实行排挤和歧视的政策，违反了中国共产党对中医的政策。过去中央卫生部曾错误地制定了许多条例和办法，如“中医师暂行条例”、“医师、中医师、牙医师、药师考试办法”、“中医进修学校及进修班的规定”等，经过这些法令的限制，使中医的合理地位，大大地受到了限制。所谓进修又主要是讲的西医课程，考试亦是出的西医题目，大多数中医当然很难望有出路了。这些错误乃是一种卑劣的资产阶级思想在卫生部门中的反映。也正如林枫主任在这次大会上的发言中对卫生部所指出的，“尤其严重的，是党中央和毛主席一再指出这种方针性的错误后，他们在实际工作中仍然没有根本的改变。最近召开的全国文教工作会议对上述错误思想进行了严肃的批判，这是完全必要的。”我们今后一定要对这一错误思想继续进行斗争，务必把这一错误观点扭转过来，为发扬祖国的宝贵的医学遗产而努力。
    由于有许多根本性的错误和缺点的存在，使得卫生部门的工作落后于其他工作部门。而造成这些错误的主要原因，则是由于卫生部某些领导人对党和政府的方针政策没有认真的研究和贯彻，缺乏政治，而又自以为是，不尊重党中央和毛主席的领导，因而就不能作认真的政治领导和业务领导，对医务人员就缺乏政治教育，不能提高他们为人民服务的观点，以致各医疗机构中常常发生责任医疗事故，同时也造成医疗工作中的忙乱现象。浪费和积压物资的现象也很严重，许多基本建设上的标准定得过高，这些都是缺乏政治必然的恶果。几年来的经验证明，卫生工作只有严格的放在党和政府的领导之下，才能得到正确的发展。否则就会犯重大错误。宋庆龄副委员长在发言中指出有些医务人员服务态度不够好，这是确实的，这也反映了我们的政治领导差，我们有责任从根本上来解决这个问题。
    五年计划中所要求于卫生工作的是十分艰巨的任务。我们必定很好地完成它。今年六月全国文教工作会议上，着重地讨论了今后卫生工作的方针问题，我们除了努力纠正过去的错误外，更需要的是努力改善卫生工作的各项具体措施，提高领导水平，随时警惕资产阶级的思想侵蚀和破坏，改善中医工作，办好高等医学教育，改善工业卫生的管理，注意农村的卫生工作，对危害人民健康更大的传染病严加管理。关于流行长江一带的血吸虫病的防治工作，最近我们已拟出了今后防治工作的方针和办法，决定在流行地区采取在党和政府的统一领导下发动群众、控制发展、限期消灭的方针。这一工作必须采取预防与治疗相结合的办法；应加强科学研究，吸取中医的经验，推广应用。消灭血吸虫病是一件长期复杂的工作，我们要求各有关部门加以配合和援助。
    今年是第一个五年计划的第三年，是具有决定意义的一年。今后我们必须勇往直进，最重要的是教育我们的医务人员、科学家、广大的卫生干部很好地学习马克思列宁主义，克服资产阶级思想，提高他们的思想水平，加强政治和业务领导，诚心诚意地学习苏联先进经验，加强培养干部，加强科学研究，发扬祖国医学遗产，提高医疗技术质量，全心全意地为社会主义建设服务。最后，我还应说：卫生部门队伍是很复杂的，必须认真地整顿自己的队伍，肃清一切反革命分子，厉行精简节约，兢兢业业地作好工作，克服一切困难，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    胡耀邦代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    伟大的中国共产党，用伟大的智慧，为我国人民设计了一幅社会主义大厦基础的蓝图。现在，我们大家都关心建造这座大厦基础的施工力量。毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”从这点出发，我请求大会注意我国人民中年轻的一代。
    我国现在有青少年一万万八千六百万，他们当中有一万万已经在祖国各个战线上劳动着，其余的八千六百万中的绝大部分在学习，或者说，他们正在积极准备为祖国劳动。如果我们更好地培植这支新生力量，并把这支力量和整个人民的力量联结起来，我们的一切事业，就有了最可靠的保证。
    青年人总是把自己的远大理想和祖国的命运紧紧地联在一起。当旧中国处在苦难的日子里，中国青年就已经紧紧地跟着党，投入了解放祖国的战斗；如今，新中国这样美好的前途已经明确地摆在我们的面前，中国青年当然会更加英勇地跟着党战斗，掀起一个建设祖国的热潮。
    我应该把话说得更确切一些。青年们一定会掀起建设祖国的更高的热潮。因为过去的两年半中，广大青年已经掀起了这种热潮。比如说，我们党号召厂矿企业展开劳动竞赛，超额完成国家计划，广大的青年职工就热烈地响应了这个号召，出现了许许多多的先进生产者和模范工作者。比如说，我们党号召建筑工程要做到“好、快、省”，许多建筑工地的年轻的工人就组织起青年突击队，把工作定额提高到两倍以至六倍。比如说，我们党号召农民组织起来，走合作化的道路，年轻的农民就成了这个运动的一支活跃力量，单拿青年团员来说，已有六百万加入了互助组，一百五十万加入了合作社，其中一百三十万是合作社互助组的骨干分子。就是说，农村的青年团员百分之九十是站在这个运动的前头。比如说，我们党号召种植油料作物，青年们就热烈地响应了这个号召，单首都的青少年就利用空地种植了一百多万棵向日葵。再比如说，我们党不久前号召全国人民实行全面节约，为加速社会主义建设而奋斗，许多地方的青年就组织了青年节约队，仅鞍钢一地的青年节约队，两个多月就拾捡了五万吨废钢废铁。我们党最近又号召人民努力肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，广大青年就忠勇地投入了这个战斗。我相信，在这场斗争中中国青年同样是不会落后的。所有这些都说明，中国青年是完全信任党的领导，忠于人民事业的。只要我们善于运用多种多样的组织形式和活动方法，去发挥青年的积极性和创造性，广大青年建设社会主义的热情，必将提得更高。
    但这并不是说，新中国的青年已经十全十美了。不是的，青年人是有弱点的，这就是经验不足，知识不足。由于青年人的经验不足，那些到死还要挣扎的力量，就是那些暗藏的反革命分子，那些被打倒了而不愿意重新做人的剥削者，那些坚决抗拒社会主义改造的人，装成青年的“好朋友”，特别是装成知识青年的“好朋友”，用千百种欺骗的方法，从思想上毒害他们，在他们中散布唯心观点、个人主义、自由主义，一句话，企图使他们脱离革命和毁灭自己。由于青年人的知识不足，他们做工作，业务能力差，他们搞生产，技术水平低。我们希望各级国家工作人员，希望一切热爱社会主义前途的人们，大家都来更好地关心我国的青年和少年，关心他们的共产主义思想、品质和道德的成长，关心他们体质的增强，关心他们特别是关心最广大的工农青年的业余文化和科学知识的学习。对我们青年团所开展的这些方面的一切活动，大力加以帮助和支持。
    谈到关心青年，我们做青年工作的有特殊的责任。干啥做啥，做啥爱啥，这是我们应有的革命责任感。几年来，由于党的领导和监督，我们虽然做了一些工作，但还做得不够。做得不够的一个主要原因，就是在我们的工作中还存在着空谈、不切实际的作风。不切实地调查研究青年中的问题，不认真组织实际工作的执行和检查，不面向广大青年进行具体的教育和组织工作，用空洞的议论去淹没那些实实在在的“小事情”，乃是我们青年团工作中的最危险的祸害。我们希望革命前辈们，严格督促我们努力改进思想作风和工作作风。我们认为，对年轻的干部要求得严些，只有好处没有害处。钢铁是高温炼成的，决不是用“温情”柔成的。我们相信，每一个决心把自己锻炼成为忠于人民的钢铁般干部的人，是会欢迎对自己的严格要求的。
    全国青年以极兴奋的心情拥护根治和开发黄河的伟大计划。我们的国家将用十几年的时间，就可以把我们祖先几千年无法驯服的黄河，变成一条规规矩矩为人民服务的清河。这个事实，当然会鼓舞青年们奋勇地参加这个斗争。我们参加这个斗争的办法是：第一，在一切工地上发挥青年们的突击作用；第二，在修建水库地区发动青年带头移民；第三，在全国青年中，特别是在陕西、甘肃、山西三省的青年中，发动植树造林，大力参加水土保持的工作。我们准备在全国青少年中发起一个长期的植树造林运动。我们计算，每人一年只要种活一棵树，平均每亩一百二十棵，全国青少年每年就可造林一百五十五万亩，每棵树成长后平均以价值五元计算，全国青少年每年就可为祖国创造九亿三千万元的巨大财富。
    伟大的胜利，必然要通过艰苦的斗争。新中国的青年一定会响应厉行节约，反对浪费的号召，发扬起革命前辈们勇于克服一切困难的战斗精神。现在有些人借口粮食不足，主张延缓国家社会主义工业化的速度。延缓工业化，就是让资本主义势力长期存在，就是让广大农民和其他小生产者长期不能摆脱贫困和痛苦，就是使祖国的肌体染上慢性的落后恶疾。我们反对这种错误的主张。为了加速提高我国的粮食产量，我完全同意李副总理所提出的用节约一部分的资金来开垦荒地。大规模地开荒，当然是一个十分艰苦和复杂的工作。但当我们想到我们的前辈流血牺牲，艰苦奋斗百余年，特别是想到中国共产党领导中国人民前仆后继，英勇牺牲，奋斗了二十八年，打出了一个新中国，想到我国现有的耕地都是祖先们用勤劳的双手开垦出来的，想到我们只要十几年就可以建成一个社会主义的国家，我们对这件事就充满着信心。新中国的青年也一定要协助党和政府，在这个艰巨任务中做勇敢的先锋队。
    新中国青年既然热爱着自己的伟大祖国，热爱着光明灿烂的社会主义前途，自然就特别了解自己在国家实行义务兵役制度中的庄严责任。去年进行义务兵役试征，几个月中报名应征的青年达一千零三万多人，青年团员报名的近四百万，这就是说，农村适龄的青年团员几乎全部报了名。青年们热烈拥护兵役法，因为他们认为这是为祖国出力的又一个好机会。青年们热烈拥护兵役法，还因为他们对人民解放军怀着深切的热爱，他们说，“当上几年兵，文通武也通”。毫无疑义，兵役法的公布，将会激起中国青年保卫祖国安全更高的爱国主义热情。彭德怀副总理在报告中提到，我国人民从来就没有而且永远也不会有侵略别国的想法，但我国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾。中国青年一定能够把在这一神圣任务中的责任担当起来。彭德怀副总理又说，我们热爱和平，但是如果帝国主义敢于把战争灾害加到我国人民的头上，侵犯我们的国土和主权的时候，我们也决不惧怕战争。对这一点，中国青年必将响亮地回答：如果战争贩子竟敢打这个倒霉的主意，祖国要多少兵，我们就有多少人。
    各位代表，我们的祖国正在向着繁荣富强的大道前进。我国人民的伟大力量一定能够实现自己的伟大计划。青年们说：“跟祖国一起前进就是幸福。”作为一个青年工作者，我将把自己的力量投在这个空前的幸福中去。
    酆云鹤代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，和李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢三位副总理及彭真副委员长的报告。
    第一个五年计划确定首先发展重工业，是完全符合我国社会主义工业化的需要和人民的长远利益的。在发展重工业的同时，还要相应地发展轻工业，以满足人民生活需要，为国家积累建设资金。纺织工业在这方面负有重大的责任。但纺织工业现有的纺锭和原料，尚不足以解决军用、民用、工业用和交通上用的各种纺织品。五年计划中规定，在恢复和发展丝、毛、麻生产的基础上，建立人造纤维工业，发展麻纺工业，这是十分正确的。现在，我就发展人造纤维和麻纺工业方面，提出一点不成熟的意见以供参考。
    我认为，要发展人造纤维工业，就必须相应地发展它所需要的纸浆工业；要发展麻纺工业，就必须相应地扩大种麻面积。
    世界各国制造人造丝的原料，多采用木浆。但木材是我国工业建设上最需要的材料，因此，应该考虑利用其他的原料，来代替和节省木浆。根据经验，可以考虑使用棉浆或掺用棉浆。我国棉籽上的短绒和棉纺厂下脚废花数量都还很大，应该利用来制造棉浆。此外如甘蔗渣、棉秆皮、高粮秆等，也应该逐一试验加以利用。在上海安乐人造丝厂对棉秆皮已开始小型试验，证明可以制造人造丝和人造纤维。
    扩大植麻面积和利用天然资源，是增加纺织工业原料的有效办法。我国气候和土壤适宜各种麻类的生长，如东北有亚麻，西北有胡麻，全国各地有大麻，沿江和滨海一带生长苎麻，西北和内蒙沙漠地带有野麻。种植苎麻、野麻并不占用主要的耕地面积，对粮食的生产没有多大妨碍；同时，麻类的生产量很高。如苎麻每亩平均产量约一百四十市斤左右，除去杂胶可得净纤维九十多市斤，比每亩的棉产量多两倍。苎麻是我国最古时候的衣着原料，世界闻名的中国夏布，就是用苎麻做的。苎麻纤维拉力很强，有棉花的五倍到六倍，又具有抗潮性，用它来做工业上、海船上、飞机上的布、带、绳子等最相宜。又如野麻产量也很大，据初步估计，每年野生约有一百多万担，它的纤维比苎麻细，拉力与苎麻相近，可以代替上等羊毛和补充棉花的不足。此外如大麻，也可以用作纺织原料。
    解放后，在党和政府的领导下，我们对于利用各种麻来作纺织原料，曾进行了一系列的试验工作，利用现有的设备，经过不断地试验，克服了大部分困难，取得了初步成绩。我们已经使用漂白的苎麻长纤维在绢纺、毛纺或麻纺机上，纺出了纯麻纱、麻毛、麻丝混纺纱及各种棉毛丝麻的混纺交织品，也在亚麻机上纺过纯麻纱。去年上海国棉九厂在棉纺机上开始试纺棉麻混纺纱，今年五月间，在苏联专家的指导下，在炼苎麻方面，因我国尚无炼短麻的机器设备，装了一套小型机器，是采用造纸用的蒸球打浆机和漂池等，并吸收了职工们的建议，作了多次改进，达到预期的要求，制成似棉的苎麻纤维，然后以棉百分之七十五，麻纤维百分之二十五，试纺三十二支混纺纱初步成功，并织成了两千多匹布，品质与纯棉布相近。又如上海国营毛纺二厂、三厂等厂，在去年试作了野麻羊毛混纺织品，如华达呢、女式呢等，又试作了丝麻混纺织物。在国营哈尔滨亚麻厂于一九五三年也试纺过大麻纱，织成了大麻与亚麻和大麻与棉纱的交织布，品质都与亚麻织物相近。
    以上这些实例说明，利用我国现有的棉、毛纺锭及亚麻机器，来扩大纺织苎麻和利用其他的麻类来作纺织原料，是有很大的可能的。
    利用各种麻类，特别是苎麻来纺织的产品，它的优点是：容易散汗、散热、抗潮，着色鲜艳，特别是在高热的夏天，穿着这种衣料，凉爽舒适。其纯麻布坚牢经用。但是，麻的纤维比较光滑，抱合力差，在纺织过程中，还存在着一些困难。我们相信在今后不断的研究试制中，一定能够逐步克服。其次，苎麻还存在着一个成本高的问题，这主要是由于手工剥麻皮费用大，影响原麻价格，今后扩大种麻时，可以试用剥麻机以降低原麻价格，同时，在制造方面也应该努力降低成本。
    为了增加纺织原料，使我国纺织工业得到相应的发展，以适当满足人民生活的需要，并争取麻织品出口，换取外汇。我们除了对于人造丝、人造纤维和各种麻类继续进行试验研究外，提出以下几点建议：1、在宜于种植苎麻的地区，如湖南、湖北、四川、江西，在不影响主要农作物的前提下，适当推广苎麻的种植；2、在土壤含碱较轻、气候较寒冷、常年多风、容易发生旱灾、不适宜种植其他农作物的地区，应鼓励农民试种野麻；3、希望有关部门帮助我们进行制造人造纤维所用的纸浆试制工作。
    在贯彻实现第一个五年计划中，必须充分利用和发展我国的科学技术力量。我是一个技术工作者，我愿追随全国技术工作者，在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，努力工作，刻苦钻研，把自己的一切贡献出来，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    裴阿欠代表的发言
    我这次出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，听了李富春副总理关于第一个五年计划的报告，非常高兴。认为这个计划就是发展国民经济、巩固国防、改善人民生活的计划，是一个使各族人民过好日子的计划，我完全拥护。李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，正是根据这一伟大计划和保证这一伟大计划的，我完全同意。
    第一个五年计划，是以大力发展重工业为中心的。国家优先发展重工业，就好像我们家里饲养母猪和母鸡。有了母猪和母鸡，才能生出许多小猪和小鸡；有了重工业才会造出各种各样的机器，我们的工业、农业和交通运输业，才能大大地发展。只有这样，我们的祖国才能富强、社会主义社会才能实现。
    我们热烈拥护国家第一个五年计划，因为这个计划胜利完成之后，国家将有更雄厚的力量来保卫国防，将以更大的力量来扶持少数民族的发展。大家知道：我们怒江傈僳族自治区，地处西南边疆，地广人稀，各族人民居住在悬崖陡壁之间，由于过去长期受帝国主义及国内反动统治阶级的压迫，造成我们的落后和贫困：刀耕火种，甚至还有用石块和木棒做农具的，吃不饱，穿不暖，用树皮草根抵口粮，用麻布树叶做衣料，根本没有一天好日子。解放后，共产党的光辉照亮了怒江河谷，毛主席的恩情温暖了碧罗雪山，像严冬枯萎了的草木，好容易熬到春天才得发绿开花，怒江各族人民的生活一天比一天好过了。我们实行了民族区域自治，自治机关盖起了砖瓦楼房，点亮了电灯，各县都架起了电话线，流动电影队到处去放映，卫生院给各族人民免费治病，自治区内修好了几条驿道，大雪也封不了山，野兽也拦不住路，工业品源源来了，土产品畅销出去了，在生产上，政府发放了许多贷款和无价农具，在先进民族的帮助下，学会了许多技术，生产发展了。各族人民面对着这些新景象，看了又看，想了又想，想到这是旷古未有的，做梦也梦不到的幸福。但是，正像我们爬山越岭，这山更比那山高，这次讨论了五年计划之后，我更看到了美好的远景。大家不是听了邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划报告吗？在我们的巨大力量面前，就没有战胜不了的敌人，不论是帝国主义侵略者，也不论是自然灾害。我们可以自豪地告诉世人：黄河数千年灾害就要根除了，黄河的无限资源就要开发出来了。黄河的规划，就是伟大祖国大规模地征服自然，利用自然的开端，就是社会主义美好远景里面的一幅。长江不是也要规划了吗？我想，将来到了共产主义社会，怒江、澜沧江、所有祖国的江河山川，都要改造它们，利用它们。“远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山……”，邓副总理引用的陕北民歌，一定要在祖国每一个坡头河边唱起来。我深深地相信：到祖国的几个五年计划实现之后，怒江区各族人民一定过到更美好的日子。那时候，碧罗雪山上将会有许多汽车跑来跑去，怒江上也许会有许多上上下下的汽船，现在的石头山将来也许会长出绿油油的庄稼。我不愿衰老，我一定要亲手参加这个伟大的建设，还要亲身过那幸福美好的日子。
    五年计划是建设社会主义的墙脚，制定它和实现它就是我们各族人民的胜利。但是，代表同志们，我们的胜利就是敌人的失败，我们的幸福就是敌人的倒霉。从我最近在怒江和丽江专区的视察结果看来，国内外敌人是不甘心失败的。在内地，反革命分子谋杀干部，破坏互助合作，当国家在丽江勘测森林的时候，反革命分子在勘测人员的四周，半天时间内就放火烧山十三处，其他还有许多在城镇农村放火投毒等案件。在边疆，美帝国主义的特务间谍分子随时窥伺着我们，他们披着宗教的外衣，进行反革命活动。去年，敌人还无耻的诱惑贡山教徒逃跑。但是我们的政策是真金，真金就不怕火烧，我也是基督教徒，我亲身参加制定的宪法中，规定了信仰宗教的自由，几年来的事实证明也是自由的。而敌人的造谣诱惑，则是一小层糖衣下面的狗屎，是饭团包着的毒药。逃跑的教徒，知道上了敌人的当，也都回来了。但从这里，我们可以得到一个教训：我们应该认真地贯彻各项政策，不要让敌人钻空子。而敌人是会无孔不入，并且会处心积虑制造裂缝的。所以更要特别提高警惕，搞好民族团结，不让帝国主义分子来破坏，要严惩那些认贼作父的民族公敌，不论内地和边疆，反革命分子必须坚决镇压。此外，彭德怀副总理关于兵役法草案的报告，就是加强国防，保卫祖国和平建设的必要措施，是各族人民的根本利益，也是各族人民的光荣义务。台湾尚待解放，帝国主义还在千方百计地破坏我们的事业，各族人民必须拥护这个兵役法，这样才能保卫边疆的各族人民，才能保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
    五年计划是我们幸福的基础，无论何地何人，应该有多大的条件就贡献出多大的力量，共同来建设伟大的祖国。我愿在共产党和上级国家机关的领导下，团结怒江区各族人民，提高自治机关的能力，贯彻各项政策，发展经济和教育文化事业；特别是因地制宜地规划山区生产，稳步发展生产互助组，多打粮食，在目前，即使只是逐步减少一些内地对我们的粮食供应，我认为也就是对工业建设的一种支援。怒江区有许多可做工业原料、可以出口换回工业设备的山货药材和土产特产，应该大力生产和大力组织收购。为了争取社会主义社会的早日到来，我们一定要从各方面努力奋斗，保证胜利完成和超额完成第一个五年计划！
    程孝刚代表的发言
    我是一个科学技术工作者，现在从这个角度，来讨论发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和李富春副总理关于这个计划的报告。
    首先，我完全同意以优先发展重工业来作为社会主义工业化的中心环节。这样做，是落后国家赶上先进国家的必要步骤，也就是所谓迎头赶上的办法。在解放以前，这样做是不可能的，所以使得我国无法摆脱殖民地类型的经济。现在我国走上独立自主的经济的道路，绝对不能容忍殖民地类型经济的存在。我们必须建立新型的工业，并把它建立在稳固健全的重工业的基础上。要做好基础工作，当然需要很大的努力，但这是必不可省的努力。重型轧钢机，重型锻压机的本身只几公尺高，但基础却深达十几公尺。任何房屋或桥梁建筑，都必须先从基础做起。一株大树，也必须扎下根，才能开花结果。这难道不都是常识吗？我国人民有克勤克俭的优良传统，又有善于做长远打算的智慧，一定会接受这个稳健政策，不惜暂时减少一些物质要求，来搞好重工业的基础。
    其次，平衡工作是经济计划的要点。我们的五年计划，对于各种平衡，都做了周密的考虑和安排，在需要与可能的基础上，达到了妥善的配合。例如计划中所提到的：工业地区的平衡，投资比率的平衡，轻工业、重工业和运输业的平衡，粮食和经济作物的平衡，国家中央计划和地方计划的平衡，科学研究计划的平衡，劳动力的平衡，等等，都是重要的环节。我认为这些平衡工作，都做得很正确。只有铁路新线，似乎少了一些，不易满足广大地区的需要，尤其不能在以后的经济计划中，对某些尚待开发的地区，发挥建设先锋的作用。我希望能从节约出来的资金中，加拨一部分投资，来增加铁路新线的建设。
    再次，我们的计划是规模宏大的计划。全国人民都为这而欢欣鼓舞。但也有人怀疑着是否能够完成。我认为值得指出的，是工业发展的速度和加速度。速度是工业发展的指数，而加速度却是提高速度的指数。工业发展的条件逐步改善了，速度就会有所提高，就能发挥加速度的作用。计划说明中，没有提到加速度。显然这不是遗漏而只是为了容易了解，因为从数字当中，可以看得出，加速度是存在着的。优先发展重工业，就是能够加速发展工业农业的条件，同时也是保证。苏联及各人民民主国家的无私帮助和我国优良而众多的劳动潜力，也是能够达到加速度的条件的保证。假使我们充分利用这些有利因素，来维持并提高工业的发展速度，这个规模宏大的第一个五年计划，是一定可以完成，而且是可以提早完成的。
    根据以上的理由，我认为发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是合理的，周密的，切合实际的，建议大会予以通过。
    五年计划的重点既然是工业，就给我们科学技术工作者以更艰巨的任务。随着工业的突飞猛进，发现了很多的新问题，需要我们去努力解决。具体地说：工业标准是工业化的关键问题，需要尽速地建立起来。新的苏联装备不断增加，还应该进一步来好好地利用维护，不使搁置也不使损坏。新工业产品是如此之多，还需要从事于研究设计制造，以满足各方面的需要。工业人才远不敷用，也落后于质量的要求，需要加强各种训练培养，以造就足够的和合格的人才。科学研究还只有初步基础，不能满足工业的要求。苏联专家以忘我劳动来帮助我国工业建设，我们应该更有组织地向专家学习，以便全面掌握新技术和新工作方法。这些都是面对着我们科学技术工作者所急迫要求但必须经过长期努力来解决的问题。尤其不要忽略的是：我国工业化必须是社会主义工业化；也就是说，必须是进步的，效率高的，为人民需要服务的，服从整体利益和长远利益的工业。任务的艰巨性当然会带来很多的困难，但我相信，科学技术工作者是不会在困难面前低头的。我们一定要努力学习和努力工作，从学习和工作中积累经验，彻底清除资产阶级思想的残余，达到自我改造，来提高业务水平和政治思想水平。这样，就能够在长期不断的努力下，逐步完成国家交给我们的光荣任务。
    我从工作的经验，很早就认识到苏联的经济计划的优越性。在抗战期间，还做过一些介绍宣传工作。那个时候，由于抗战的创伤和蒋政权的腐败，曾因为不晓得何时能在中国实行计划经济而感到苦闷。但完全没有料到，只过了十几年，就在我国实行了计划经济，而且在实行的两年当中，已经取得了辉煌的伟大的成就。从这些事实中，加深了我对社会主义的优越性、工人阶级、共产党和毛主席的英明领导的认识。我深深地感到，能够参加第一个五年计划的讨论和审查，是非常光荣的任务。我一定要贡献最大的努力，为实现这个计划而奋斗。
    习仲勋秘书长的发言
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。我仅就精简国家机关的工作，讲一些情况和意见。
    精简国家机关，缩减国家行政开支，是我们国家的一项重要政策，是厉行节约，积累建设资金的必要手段，又是改进国家机关工作，保障国家建设事业胜利前进的有力措施。中华人民共和国建立以来，在国家机关中曾经几次进行过精简工作和不断地进行了反对官僚主义斗争，对于改进国家机关工作，保证各项工作任务的胜利完成，起了重要的作用。现在的问题是国家机关在各种建设事业迅速发展的过程中，又产生了和更明显地暴露了许多不合理现象。主要表现在，国家上层领导机关中机构重叠，编制庞大，人浮于事，工作效率不高，工作秩序紊乱，而基层单位则骨干缺乏，领导力量薄弱，不能适应当前繁重复杂的经济建设工作和农村工作任务。在领导机关中，有不少大专学校毕业生和技术人员担任一般行政事务工作，而很多厂矿企业和科学研究机关的专业人材和技术人员，则又极其缺少。许多行政机关事务人员占的比重很大，中央一级机关一般占到全部工作人员的百分之三十五到四十。许多企业、事业单位，非生产人员和非业务人员也占的比重很大，很多都占到全部人员的百分之三十以上。许多机关负责人不按实际需要，任意增设机构、扩大编制，使机关不少人员无事可做，或者事情很少。许多机关的行政机构和事业机构混淆不清，或者是将行政单位超过编制的人数挤到事业单位，或者是把事业单位的工作完全同行政机关一样办，没有定员定额，没有经济核算。也还有些机关负责人不遵守人事制度，擅自用人，不注意审查人员的政治情况，给予了各种反革命分子以隐匿藏身的便利机会。有些中央机关有许多应当交给地方去做的事没有交下去，而是抓上来或者是在地方上设立了不必要的重复机构。由于机构庞大，层次繁多，就产生了职责不清，办事手续繁琐，拖拉迟缓，同时也助长了文牍主义、官僚主义现象的发生和发展，中央机关的公文、表报多，会议多，一般号召多，检查工作少，具体指导少，成了相当普遍的现象。所有这些现象，如果不能及时地坚决地加以纠正，势必对于国家建设事业造成严重损害。
    为了合理使用国家人力、财力、进一步改进国家机关的工作，以便加强社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的领导，有计划地有步骤地对国家机关和国家的各种事业、企业单位进行精简工作，是完全必要的。
    今年一月间，在中共中央和毛泽东主席的指示下，国务院成立了编制工资委员会，负责主持精简国家机关的工作，并决定贯彻精简机构、紧缩编制、调整干部的方针，首先在中央机关进行这一工作。经过几个月的工作，证明了国家机关的机构，是应当而且可能更加精干的，人员是能够缩减下来的，并且缩减的数目相当大。截至六月底止，据不完全统计，政府机关已经缩减了原有人数的百分之四十以上，中共中央直属机关已经缩减了原有人数的百分之四十七。这一工作目前还在继续进行，赶到最后确定新的编制方案时，缩减的数字还会更大
  一些。
    怎样进行精简？最基本的办法，就是各单位结合检查工作，总结经验，明确业务范围和工作方法，在这个基础上研究精简计划，确定新的编制方案。凡是机构编制上有不合理现象，往往是由于对业务范围的认识和工作的安排方法上有毛病。每一个单位，都要研究清楚，什么事是自己主管的业务，什么事是配合别的单位办的业务。在自己主管的业务里边，又是那些是第一位的，那些是第二、第三位的，那些事是要集中到中央管的，那些事是要分散到地方管的，那些事是要今天举办的，那些事是要在今后逐步举办的，等等。综合各单位的情况看，我们现在机构编制上的毛病，最主要的，就是重叠机构多，中间层次多，非业务人员多，既浪费人力又影响机关工作效率和质量。我们精简工作的重点，也就是放在这些方面的。据十一个单位已报来新的编制方案看：司、局机构减少百分之十，处、科机构减少百分之三十四点七。有些单位的处、科、组，减少了百分之五十以上，有的还减少了百分之七十以上。大部分单位，从过去的四级制或五级制，改为三级制或二级制。有七个单位，仅是撤销十七个地方二级机构，并对八个地方二级机构的编制大加紧缩，就减少了三千六百多人。这些措施，可以节省大量的工作人员，又能够腾出很多骨干。非业务人员，即行政管理人员和服务人员，也可以大大减少；如服务人员，农业部减少百分之七十四点五，林业部减少百分之六十三点八，最高人民法院减少百分之五十六，许多单位都能减少百分之五十以上。此外，经过计算工作量，一般的业务机构，都节省出了好些人，有少数事多人少的业务机构，也得到调整，适当地增加了人员，加强了领导力量。精简中抽调出来的干部，除中央机关必要的调整外，还可调出两万多干部去加强各级地方机构和基层生产单位。
    正确地处理精简中抽调出来的人员，是彻底做好精简工作最重要的环节，必须采取认真负责的态度，解决一系列的复杂的实际问题，切实把这项工作做好。我们认为，在精简中抽调出来的人员，是国家宝贵的财产，他们都将得到更合理的使用，或者得到必要的安置，因而可以在国家建设事业中发挥更大的作用。具体说来，首先要调配大批人员去加强各级地方机构和基层生产单位，这里主要对象是两种人：一种是有一定的实际工作经验的老干部，一种是大批的青年知识分子干部；前者放下去可以充实基层的骨干力量，后者放下去可以在实际工作中得到更好的锻炼；其中有些过去使用不当的专业人材，也可以得到合理调整。其次，要调一批青年干部到各种学校学习，为国家培养建设人材，有的可投考高等学校，有的可送中等技术学校学习技术。第三、缩减下来的服务人员，有的可调至下层机构工作，有的可送技工学校学习，有的可由劳动部门调配到工厂、矿山和国营农场参加劳动生产，少数愿意回家生产的按退职办法处理。以上三项，要占这次精简中缩减下来的人员的绝大部分。此外，对于少数丧失工作能力的人员，患慢性病需要较长时期休养的人员，也要采取适当办法作妥善安置。我们正在依据上述原则，拟订具体实施的办法和步骤，准备着手进行对调职离职人员的处理工作，进行干部调整工作。由此可见，有些人把我们的精简同国民党反动统治时代的“裁员”一样看待，有些人认为精简中抽调出来的人员会成为国家的
  “大包袱”，有些人顾虑精简工作会大量增加社会失业现象，都是不正确的，都是从消极方面去看精简工作，而不是从积极方面去看精简工作。当然，有些机关的领导人，只将难以分配工作的人员调出来，或者对抽调出来的人员“推出了事”，这些作法是错误的，必须加以纠正。有些调职离职的人员，不愿服从国家调配，不愿离开大城市，不愿到下层去，不愿到农村和厂矿去，这些思想是不对的，也是要进行教育和纠正的。
    现在，中央机关的精简工作，大部还在拟订新的编制方案，但从已经获得的成绩来看，效果是很好的。不少的单位，在精简过程中研究了业务，调整了机构，建立了一些制度，改进了一些工作方法和领导作风。过去机构重叠，层次太多，业务范围不清，工作职责不明，工作上重复、拖拉甚至无人负责的现象；过去人浮于事，部分干部不安心、闹情绪，积极性不高，责任心不强，纪律松懈，工作效率低的现象；过去服务人员多、非业务人员多，公文、表报、会议多等等不合理现象，都已开始有所改善。过去没有办法解决的一些困难问题也都好解决了。过去房子总是不够住，家具总是不够用，汽车总是不够坐，现在情况变了。现在，是要考虑缩减行政建房计划的问题，是要收回一大批汽车、沙发、地毯和其他家具另行处理的问题。当然，这样的问题比较大家都伸手要东西的问题，是容易解决的。
    这些，还只是初步的收获。今后各机关在确定新的编制方案，合理调整人员的过程中，还要切实注意改进工作作风，建立良好的工作秩序，把工作做得比以前更好。还要建立和健全相应的工作制度，今后不论任何机关凡增设机构，增加人员，必须经过一定的审批手续，主管编制和人事工作的机构，并应经常注意检查督促，贯彻执行。这样，才能充分发挥精简工作的积极作用，巩固精简工作的成果。
    正因为精简国家机关的工作，在目前十分必要，贯彻下去，好处很多，中共中央和国务院已经决定要逐步地在全国范围内开展精简工作，加强编制管理工作，不仅是各级行政领导机关要精简，企业、事业单位也要精简。我们必须坚决贯彻中央的方针，认真推行精简工作，并结合开展节约运动，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，改进领导工作作风，提高国家机关的工作效率，为胜利完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    陈垣代表的发言
    我们再三阅读并钻研了“发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”草案，并听取了李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，又听到陈云副总理的发言，我和大家一样完全拥护，并决心为其实现而奋斗。
    我感觉到幸福美好的远景具体的全面的展示在眼前，我们国家在社会主义建设上得到了强有力的保证，我衷心感谢共产党、感谢毛主席。连日以来，我非常兴奋，我这才真正感到我语汇的贫乏，实在没有恰当的词句来表达我欢欣鼓舞的心情。翻遍二十四史、历代大政治家文集，以及经世文编等等，从来没有像这样伟大的著作。这是历史上所没有的，当然也是不可能有的，只有工人阶级领导的革命取得胜利，才能为全国人民长远的和最高的利益作出详尽的计划，并领导我们走向胜利。
    我深深为我们生在伟大的毛泽东时代的人感到光荣和幸福，我们能赶上这样伟大的时代，怎能不竭心尽力地坚决地贡献出自己的力量呢？怎能不忠心赤胆地老老实实地为人民服务呢？怎能不为胜利的完成并超额完成第一个五年计划而加倍努力呢？
    我们也时时刻刻都不能忘记：我们建设得越好，敌人就越不甘心，今天我们的国家正在共产党和毛主席领导下进行着我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业，敌人就越发痛恨。因此，我们决不能只是埋头建设，必须要提高政治警惕性，肃清胡风反革命集团及暗藏在我们内部的一切反革命分子，以保卫我们美好的建设事业。
    关于培养建设干部，加强科学研究工作，我想讲几句话，请大家指教。
    要建设社会主义社会，要使国家成为高度的现代工业化国家，培养干部的问题，也就越来越重要了。斯大林在一九三五年说：“人材、干部是世界上所有一切宝贵资本中最宝贵最有决定意义的资本。”他又说：“如果我们在工业、农业、运输业和军队中将有人数众多的优良干部，那我们的国家就会是不可战胜的，如果我们不会有这种干部，那我们就会寸步难移。”我们作为教育工作者，就更感觉到培养干部工作责任的严重。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“科学技术人材的缺乏，显然是我们前进中的一个巨大的困难。”因此他指出，培养忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的各种建设人材，是我们必须完成的重大政治任务之一。这就是说：我们所迫切需要的各种建设人材，不仅要具有高度的科学技术水平，而且更重要的是要全心全意，无限忠诚，效忠于人民民主制度。我们高等学校就是要源源不绝地把这最宝贵最有决定意义的资本负责输送给祖国建设的各个战线，也就是要负责给国家培养出技术好、身体健康，而且首先是政治上可靠的干部。我们不但要保证数量，尤其重要的是保证质量。所以我们教学一定要贯彻全面发展的教育方针，不但要重视专业教育，同时还要大力加强政治思想教育，并注意健康教育。要使同学们的知识、体格和政治三方面都达到一定的质量，三者缺一就很难担当起建设祖国的神圣任务。
    我们高等师范院校，五年之内新设置十九所，五年内的高等师范毕业生人数是七万零四百人，占各类高等学校学生的百分之二十四点九，这就是说五年内高等学校毕业的学生中的四分之一，是要我们高等师范院校来培养，这是国家交付我们的光荣重大的责任。高等师范院校毕业的学生，绝大部分是作中等学校的师资，而各种各类高级技术干部的培养，要在中等学校打好基础。我们的工作不仅是在培养建设第一个五年计划的干部，而且也是为培养建设第二个第三个五年计划的干部打好基础，为建设社会主义准备后备力量。我们的工作是建设中极重要的组成部分。如果我们的工作做得不好，毕业的学生不能保证质量，那我们的整个建设计划就要受到影响。今天，我们高等师范教育的工作，还存在着缺点，培养出来的干部的质量，还不能完全符合国家的要求。因此，我们从事高等师范教育工作的同志，今后是丝毫不能懈怠的，一定要努力改进教学，提高并保证教育质量，这就是要在教育工作中贯彻“百年大计，质量第一”的精神。
    要想真正做到提高质量、保证质量，首先就是要我们教师们进一步改造思想，加强马克思列宁主义和时事政策的学习，以正确的立场、观点、方法来进行教学。并要继续加强科学研究工作，逐步开展学术思想批判，宣传唯物主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，做到科学研究切实地结合教学，结合国家建设需要。今后我们的教学改革越深入，学术批判就越开展；经济建设越发展，就会越感到科学研究的重要性，科学研究工作也就必需加强。而加强科学研究，教学本身也会不断改进。所以教师们的政治水平和业务水平的提高，是确保教学质量的最主要的一环，这也是我们在完成国家建设计划工作中，必需首先做到的。
    我是教育工作者，又是科学工作者，我愿和大家一起，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，以便更好地进行科学研究。不过，正像郭沫若副委员长所说的：“上了年纪的人就不免要感觉着困难，那是由于我们旧有的先入之见在作怪。”我们老人的确是如此。但是，也正因为如此，就更要加倍努力以最大的毅力来克服这种困难，为完成国家和人民交给我们的重大任务而努力。
    我们祖国正在迅速地向着美好的社会主义迈进，我们的前途是无限灿烂光明的。前人所不能做的事，我们今天在创造着；前人所未完成的理想，我们今天在实现着。今后，我们全国各族人民团结一致，在共产党和毛主席领导之下，在苏联和人民民主国家的无私帮助下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的关切与支持之下，我们的力量是无敌的，我们有充分的信心，正像毛主席在去年开大会时所指示我们的：“我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”
    陶淑范代表的发言
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议开会以来，我们听到了五个报告，我完全同意和衷心的拥护这些报告。李富春副总理所做的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，给了我极大的鼓舞，使我对祖国社会主义建设的前景增加了无限的信心。我国过去由于帝国主义与封建势力的统治，经济、文化是很落后的，我国人民在伟大的共产党和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席正确的领导下取得了革命胜利。中华人民共和国成立以来，仅仅用三年的时间，就胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作，紧接着就开始了五年计划。从李富春副总理的报告中，我们知道了在第一个五年计划中工业建设是重点，钢铁工业、发电、机器制造等工业都将有很大的发展，这将给我国社会主义工业化打下初步基础。我国的第一个五年计划是大规模的，是快速度的，除了苏联帮助我们建立的一百五十六项大企业外，还有几千个中小企业，这些在五年内绝大多数都要完成的。中国共产党所公布的过渡时期的总路线给全国人民指出了努力的方向，它像灯塔一样照亮着我们前进的道路；在这个五年计划中，我们又看到了共产党和毛主席如此正确地全盘安排了我国社会主义建设的每一个细节，它把党在过渡时期的总路线具体化了，使我非常明确地了解到，我们要怎样积极稳步前进，把我国建成伟大的社会主义国家。
    我是一个小学教师。我国全体小学教师的任务，是为祖国培养全面发展的新人，培养社会主义社会的建设者和保卫者。这是一个十分光荣十分艰巨的任务。我一定同全国百万小学教育工作者和全国人民一道，用极大的热情，在这一光荣的岗位上，努力实现第一个五年计划。我们知道，只要把我们自己的工作做好，克服困难，改正缺点，就可以促进五年计划更快地完成。所以我们担负的任务，和建设祖国的其他任务一样，同样是伟大的光荣的。我们小学教师，一定要在中国共产党的领导下，和全国各阶层各民族人民同心协力，更积极地参与国家政治生活与建设事业。
    解放以来，我们小学教师经过了历次社会改革运动，和政治、业务的学习，思想觉悟和教学业务水平都有所提高，教师们发挥了积极性，创造性，总结了许多经验，出现了许多模范人物。因此，学生学业成绩也有一定的进步，这是主要的方面。但是另一方面，目前我们小学教师中还普遍地存在着资产阶级思想，在我们的队伍中还存在有暗藏的反革命分子和严重的违法乱纪分子。这种情况显然是和实现我们光荣的培养社会主义新人的任务不能适应的。为了完成国家交给我们的任务，我们目前最迫切的工作是什么呢？一方面，我们必须积极地参加当前的思想批判工作，批判资产阶级思想，特别是资产阶级唯心主义，努力学习马克思列宁主义，特别是辩证唯物主义。我们必须坚决反对那种资产阶级的只重业务忽视政治的错误观点。我们一定要关心政治，关心国家大事、关心社会主义建设事业。我们要反对用资产阶级的态度对待学生，凭个人喜爱与否偏爱偏恶，反对用资产阶级观点和方法进行教学和教育工作，管教不管导，管教不管懂，教书不教人，只管教书，不管学生健康与否和品德好坏，甚至还有体罚学生，不尊重学生人格的现象。这些都是违背国家教育方针的。另一方面，对于隐藏在我们队伍里的反革命分子和严重的违法乱纪分子，我们必须坚决彻底地予以清除，决不容许他们继续破坏人民的教育事业。我们必须提高警惕，揭发我们队伍中的一切反革命分子，揭发我们队伍中的一切严重的违法乱纪行为，纯洁我们的队伍。这是我们全体小学教师当前最主要的工作，我们一定要努力去做。
      我自己深深地感到，在这伟大的时代里，如果不努力学习政治理论和国家的方针政策，我们就会赶不上客观形势和工作的需要，就会落后。我是在旧社会长大的人，受了许多资产阶级唯心主义思想的影响。我在实际经验中体会到，只要这些东西在思想上一抬头，工作立刻就会发生问题，妨碍自己的进步和同志间的团结，给工作造成损失。因此，我们必须努力赶上时代的要求。
    几年来，政府对于教师进修工作是非常重视的，在第一个五年计划里，又提到要有计划的积极的广泛的开展业余的文化教育工作，大量的举办正规的业余学校和函授学校，使没有受过系统的科学教育和文化的教育的在职干部，能够有机会逐步地系统的提高自己的文化科学技术水平。文化水平低的教师可以按自己的程度分别参加进修学校、函授学校学习或者自学，有计划有系统地提高自己。这也是目前我们小学教师的一项迫切的工作。只有不断地提高我们自己，才能提高我们的教育工作质量。
    今后我们的教育工作要为实现五年计划服务，必须贯彻全面发展的教育方针，提高学校教育工作质量，一切要从国家的社会主义建设的利益出发，我们要继续努力学习苏联教育的先进经验，学习苏联人民在完成第一个五年计划时的节衣缩食，刻苦建设的精神，发扬老解放区教师艰苦奋斗的作风。　　我们现在正在走着的道路，正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说的是我们的先人不曾走过的道路，沿着这条道路，我们祖国将日新月异地改变着自己的面貌，一天天地接近共产主义的幸福生活。我们小学教师愿意献出自己的全部力量，我们要向生产战线上的工人兄弟们看齐，我们要用同样发挥自己的智慧和才能，用创造性的劳动教育好新的一代，为实现五年计划而斗争。
    召存信代表的发言
    李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”和彭真副委员长关于常务委员会工作报告，是完全符合全国各民族人民的最高利益和长远利益的，我完全同意和拥护，并坚决为贯彻实现伟大的第一个五年计划而努力。
    处在祖国西南边疆的西双版纳傣族自治州各族人民，在实行了区域自治以后，正在逐步地实现着我国宪法所规定的各项自治权利。在中国共产党、毛主席和上级国家机关的正确领导下，在全国各兄弟民族人民特别是汉族人民的热情关怀和大力帮助下，我们那里各族人民之间和民族内部一天比一天的更加紧密地团结起来了，人民的物质生活和文化生活也不断地得到提高和改善。例如，几种主要的农业生产一九五四年比一九五三年增长的情况是：稻谷增产了百分之六点九，茶叶增产百分之二十六点四，棉花增产百分之二十九点二五，樟脑增产百分之二百。公路修通以后，工业产品的销售价格也降低了百分之八点三三至百分之三十三点四。工农业产品也得到了合理的交换，因而增加了人民的收入，提高了人民的生活水平，一九五四年农村购买力平均每人达到四十元，今年预计将要提高到五十元左右。初解放时，我们只有几所小学校，学生五百多人，现在已增加了八倍多，除一部分学生送中央、西南、省民族学院及其他专门学校学习外，现在在西双版纳有民族干部学校一所，学生四百六十四人，初级师范学校一所，学生一百一十五人；小学校四十五所，学生四千七百多人，小学生中百分之七十二以上都是本地各民族的儿童。最近中央批准了我们试行由科学院和云南省民族事务委员会协助改进的傣文方案，这样，西双版纳的文化、教育事业定将得到更迅速的发展。到目前为止，全区的卫生机构已比一九五○年增加了十多个，卫生工作人员也增加了一百多人，两年来，各族人民得到免费治疗的已达二十二万五千一百多人次，因而大大地减少了人民的疾病和死亡，保障了各族人民的身体健康，保证了人民得到安心生产。现在自治州内各部门系统的干部中，本地民族干部已占总数的百分之四十四点九八，而在自治州人民委员会的许多部门中，都由本地民族干部担任主要负责工作。汉文和傣文已经成为自治机关行使职权的工具。
    但是我们还存在许多缺点，主要是没有充分地实现自治机关的自治权利，对于危害国家人民生命财产的反革命分子和各种罪犯，没有及时惩办，使反革命分子有机可乘。另一方面我们争取汉族人民、汉族干部的帮助，及时的向上级反映情况，争取上级领导和帮助的主动性也不够，对干部的培养教育工作，特别是对民族干部的教育，提高质量也做得还差。今后我们在共产党和上级国家机关的领导下，沿着社会主义大道的前进中，要争取不断地克服这些缺点。西双版纳是处在祖国的边疆，面对着美帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮的阴谋破坏，它们并不甘心失败，而在那里处心积虑地进行各种阴谋破坏活动，如近来在边疆地区挑拨民族团结、散布谣言、破坏生产、破坏交通、威胁群众，以至杀人放火等等罪恶活动。单今年上半年全区被烧毁的民房和仓库达二十起，今年五月版纳勐遮城子被反革命分子纵火烧毁百货公司就损失二十多万元，民房被烧三十一户。反革命分子之所以如此猖狂，主要是由于帝国主义及国民党匪帮的垂死挣扎，而另一方面也是我们的警惕性不高，对于敌人的破坏活动没有给予及时的惩办，致使国家和人民的生命财产遭受了损失。我们必须贯彻宪法第十九条所规定的：“中华人民共和国保卫人民民主制度，镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子。”为了保卫各族人民的生命财产，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫祖国的神圣领土，支援解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，西双版纳各族人民，必须在共产党和上级国家机关的领导下，继续加强团结，提高各族人民的爱国主义觉悟，加强联防自卫，清除土匪特务，坚决肃清一切反革命分子，依法处理各种刑事犯，随时粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋破坏！
    崔建功代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”、邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”和彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”。这些报告，对我是一次最深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞。
    从李富春副总理和邓子恢副总理的报告中，我们可以清楚地看到我们国家富强和人民幸福的光辉灿烂的前景。我国人民长期以来的理想，现在在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，将要用自己的刻苦劳动、按照国家计划一步步地实现起来。我作为一个革命军人，更感到自己责任的重大和我们事业的光荣。　　自从国家有计划建设开始后，我国各方面的建设都已经有了迅速的发展，人民生活有了不断的改善。同时，随着经济建设的发展，我们的国防建设也有了进一步的发展。从军队方面说，现在我们的武器装备已大大地改善了，物资供应也更充分了。我们战士领到了祖国自己制造的许多武器，都感到无限的兴奋，他们把这些武器看作是我国社会主义工业发展的标志，他们把它当作祖国给予我们每个军人的崇高的期望和庄严的付托。去年七月以后，我国自己制造的飞机又已经开始飞翔在祖国的天空。这一切，都鼓舞着我们部队的指挥员、战斗员，大大地增强了我们保卫祖国、解放台湾、保卫和平的意志和决心。我们部队的指挥员、战斗员深深地知道：帝国主义是极端仇视我国人民已取得的胜利，仇视我们和平民主与社会主义阵营的各国人民的；美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾，并积极扶助蒋介石卖国集团，妄图对我国发动突然的袭击。在这种情况下，只有加强我国国防力量，加速我军的现代化建设，才能有效地防止帝国主义的侵略，才能为我国社会主义建设争取一个和平的安全的环境。但是我们同时知道：军队的现代化建设是离不开国家的工业化建设的。因此部队的同志们对于国家社会主义工业化的期望极为殷切，希望国家供给更大量的新式的飞机、大炮、坦克、舰艇和其他武器装备。现在，五年建设计划和兵役法的制定，已为国防现代化创造了非常有利的条件，我们部队的全体指挥员和战斗员都感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。我们坚定地相信：我们依靠着国家工业化的雄厚的物质基础和训练有素养的现役兵员和预备役兵员，帝国主义如果敢于发动侵略战争，它们所遭受到的将是粉碎性的打击！
    为了保证国家五年计划的顺利实现，我们每个革命军人的决心和实际行动就是：加紧训练，不懈地提高作战本领，为解放台湾和沿海岛屿而奋斗。我自己现在正在军事学校学习，我决心以自己最大的刻苦努力，学习苏联先进的军事科学。在日常的学习和工作中，要时刻警惕敌人，不仅要注视帝国主义的侵略阴谋，同时还要警惕暗藏的反革命分子的破坏。潘汉年、胡风的反革命事件也告诉了我们：一个革命军人不仅要学习善于同公开的敌人作战，而且要学会跟伪装的敌人作斗争。我们一定要把那些危害着国家和人民军队的蟊贼彻底清除出去。为支持国家的社会主义建设，我决心以自己的模范行动切实遵守党和国家的政策及各项具体措施，按照李富春副总理在报告中所指示的精神，厉行节约、反对浪费、教育部属，更加注意爱护武器弹药、粮食及其他一切物资，发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，使我国一点一滴的财产都有效地用于发展国民经济和国防事业。史良部长的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告以及李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业已从各个战线上取得了辉煌的胜利。第一个五年计划，乃是实现过渡时期总任务，把我们国家建设成伟大的社会主义工业国的一个重大步骤。这是中国人民胜利的标志。随着第一个五年计划的实施和胜利进行，人民民主专政将更加巩固。但是，我们的敌人也懂得，我们愈胜利，他们就愈失败。凡是我们要做的，敌人就必然是乘机伺隙来加以破坏。作为人民民主专政武器之一的人民司法机关，对此应充分理解，时时刻刻保持高度警惕，克尽职责，以保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。一九五三年四月第二届全国司法会议就确定了司法工作必须为经济建设服务的方针。两年来，全国司法机关都遵循这一方针进行工作。在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过并公布了宪法和人民法院组织法以后，最高人民法院和司法部在一九五四年十一月又召集各高级人民法院院长，各省、市司法厅、局长的座谈会，集中学习了宪法和人民法院组织法，并研究了如何贯彻人民法院组织法的问题。其后各省、市司法厅、局和高级人民法院也都召开了基层法院以上主要干部的座谈会，逐级贯彻下去。今年六月间，最高人民法院和司法部又召开了一次司法工作座谈会，检查贯彻人民法院组织法的情况。根据各地报告，凡是开过人民代表大会的地方，都按照宪法和人民法院组织法的规定选举了人民法院院长。有些地方的人民法院已经执行向人民代表大会报告工作的制度。除边疆地区的法院以外，极大多数的人民法院对人民法院组织法所规定的公开审判、陪审、合议、辩护、回避等制度，已基本贯彻执行。现在全国已经选出人民陪审员十二万七千二百五十人，实行轮值陪审，绝大多数的一审案件都实行了陪审制度。广大人民群众参加了国家管理的工作，他们说：“人民法院真是咱们自己的法院”，“现在真正人民当家作主了”。人民群众直接参加审判的结果，就大大提高了办案质量和办案速度。凡是实行了人民陪审员制度的一审案件，都实行了合议制。辽宁、上海等二十个省、市高级人民法院和城市中级人民法院的二审案件也已普遍实行了合议制。由于合议制的实行，对克服审判人员主观独断、片面的不良审判作风起了很大的作用。各级人民法院审理案件，除法律规定不应公开审理的以外，绝大部分案件的审判，已经做到了公开进行。并在审讯中普遍执行了回避制度和辩护制度。被告人除自己充分进行辩护并在必要时由人民法院指定辩护人为他辩护外，还可以由他的近亲属或合乎法律规定的其他辩护人为他辩护。我们还在北京、上海、武汉等大、中城市试办人民律师制度，待取得必要经验后再行逐步推广。广大人民群众对实行公开审判制度和辩护制度是十分满意的。有些地方群众反映：“法院这样办案三头满意”，即原告、被告、群众都满意。随着人民法院组织法的贯彻执行，司法干部的审判作风已有改善。由于复杂的历史因素、社会因素及资产阶级唯心主义的影响，目前审判工作中还残存着先入为主、偏听偏信、轻信口供、不重证据、主观臆断的主观主义审判作风。因此，必须加强各级人民法院的思想领导和上级人民法院对下级人民法院的审判监督，必须加强唯物主义的学习，必须加强各级人民代表大会对各级人民法院工作的检查和监督，坚决克服这一不良的审判作风。从一九五四年一月到今年五月，全国各级人民法院受理了反革命的和有关经济建设的初审案件三十六万四千六百零四件（缺新疆省和其他省的个别地区的今年统计数字），占同时期的刑事案件的百分之三十点九二。从而打击了反革命分子及其他各种刑事犯罪分子的破坏活动，并处理了一些应负刑事责任的重大责任事故案件。在一百七十多个厂矿企业中，试办了职工群众用以自我教育和自我感化的同志审判会，处理了一些不须追究法律责任的责任事故及有关劳动纪律的事件，对广大职工群众进行了提高革命警惕、遵守操作规程和劳动纪律的宣传与教育。为了保障国家交通运输事业，建立了十一个铁路运输法院和两个水上运输法院。已有二百九十四个人民法院举办了公证工作。仅一九五四年一年中就办理了十二万三千多件公证事项。经过了公证的公私合同，百分之九十以上都能履行合同。这就有效地保障了国家建设和私营工商业的正当经营，防止了不法资本家盗窃国家资财，破坏合同的“五毒”行为。为了保障农业互助合作运动的顺利进行、保护人民的合法利益、减少群众讼累，各基层人民法院分别建立了三千七百九十五个巡回法庭，并正在逐步转为人民法庭。还建立了十五万七千九百六十六个人民调解委员会，以便适时地打击对农业社会主义改造的各种犯罪分子并调解人民内部纠纷。随着各项司法建设的逐步加强，对保障国民经济建设的第一个五年计划的实施具有重大意义。
    社会主义建设事业愈加胜利，敌人就愈加失败，他们企图逃脱死亡的命运，必然要疯狂地对我们国家的建设事业进行各种破坏活动。从破坏经济建设的刑事案件的数量看，如河北省一九五四年受理的破坏经济建设案件，较一九五三年上升百分之一百六十，其中反革命的破坏较一九五三年上升百分之一百六十五，不法资本家及其他犯罪分子的破坏案件上升百分之一百零六。山西省今年第一季度受理的反革命破坏经济建设案件，比一九五三年同时期增加两倍，破坏农业生产合作社的案件也增加两倍以上。贵州省一九五五年第一季度发生的各种破坏案件，较一九五四年第四季度上升百分之十三。其中凶杀案上升百分之二十七点四，纵火案上升百分之九十。我们由于对当前的阶级斗争形势和敌人的破坏认识不足，盲目陶醉于过去的镇反成绩与国家建设的伟大胜利，因而对上述情形就熟视无睹，普遍地存在着该捕不捕、该判不判、重罪轻判的右倾太平麻痹思想。有的人民法院将连写七次反动标语的反革命现行犯，认为“查无反动历史”而释放了。有的省从一九五四年到今年三月，全省各级人民法院共处理窃盗案八千四百六十五件，判处五年以下徒刑和免刑的就占百分之九十。有的县人民法院对一件反革命案竟拖延至六年之久。这种对反革命分子及其他各种刑事犯罪分子打击不力、惩办不严、处理不及时的右倾现象，给予国家和人民极大的危害，助长了反革命分子破坏活动的气焰，有的反革命分子竟敢当庭行凶；有的竟于刑满释放或假释之后，又重新犯罪，根据各地不完全的统计，现行反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子中，有百分之四十以上都是刑满释放后的重犯，这些事实，证明了我们过去对反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子处刑过轻、过于宽大的错误。对这种错误，我们司法部的领导是要负责任的。今年六月司法工作座谈会上已认真地检查和批判了这种错误，应本今后从严的原则，要求各级人民法院立即坚决纠正。第一个五年计划经这次会议通过后，就成为全国人民奋斗的目标。国家机关和全国人民都必须为实现这个计划而作出自己的贡献。司法机关必须配合公安、检察机关坚决镇压敢于破坏国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的一切反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子，继续惩治贪污、盗窃社会主义财产的犯罪分子以及构成刑事罪责的重大责任事故和严重违犯劳动纪律的犯罪分子，以保障第一个五年计划的顺利实施。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席英明正确的领导下，在伟大苏联和各人民民主国家的支持帮助下，在国家机关和全国人民的共同努力下，我们的第一个五年计划是一定能够胜利完成的。
    杨秀峰部长的发言
    我完全拥护国务院向大会提出的关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案，一九五四年国家决算及一九五五年国家预算、中华人民共和国兵役法草案，以及李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢各位副总理向大会所作的报告。同意彭真副委员长代表常务委员会所作的报告。　
　关于高等教育工作的许多问题，在林枫主任的发言中都已讲过了，我完全同意。现在仅就如何提高高等教育质量的问题作扼要的补充说明。根据发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的要求，全国高等学校在第一个五年计划内要为国家培养毕业生二十八万三千人，这数目相当于解放前国民党统治时期二十年间（一九二八——一九四七年）高等学校毕业生总数的一倍半，其中工科毕业生九万四千余人，相当于解放前二十年间工科毕业生总数的三倍。预计到一九五七年，全国高等学校在校学生数将要达到四十三万四千余人，相当于一九四七年（国民党统治时期学生最多的年代）在校学生数的二点二倍；其中工科十七万七千余人，相当于一九四七年的六倍多。解放以来，我们共修建高等学校校舍四百二十四万平方公尺，比旧中国自一八九八至一九四八年五十一年间所建筑的高等学校校舍还超过一百零五万余平方公尺。这充分说明了在中国共产党领导下的人民民主政权对于培养干部事业的关怀和重视，也反映了国家各方面建设的突飞猛进。　　在第一个五年计划的头三年中，高等学校毕业生数共十五万三千余人，已完成五年计划总任务的百分之五十四；其中工科毕业生五万余人，已完成五年计划总任务的百分之五十三。一九五五年下半年在校学生数将达到五年计划总增长数的百分之六十六，其中工科将达到百分之六十二。虽然今后的发展还有不少困难，但我们相信，五年计划的任务是能够完成的。如果招生时报考人数多、质量好，我们还将尽师资力量的最大可能争取超额完成计划。　　由于党和国家重视培养干部工作，几年来，高等教育有了较大的发展，并进行了一系列的整顿改革工作。但是从国家的需要来说，我们的工作还作得很不够，我们在贯彻执行方针政策上还存着不少的严重缺点，有许多问题还没有很好地解决，第一、培养干部的质量还远不能适应建设的要求；第二、高等学校各类专业设置与发展的比例还不能完全切合需要，还应在尽快地查明各部门第二个五年计划干部需要情况后，加以适当调整；第三、高等学校的设置分布还不能和国家经济发展与部署相适应，今后建设新校的时候，要根据国家经济建设的规划，尽可能地和新建工业基地相结合；第四、我们对于培养在职工人、职员的业余教育工作还没有很好地注意，今后应把举办业余教育作为培养干部计划的一个重要组成部分来大力进行；第五、在学校的基本建设、人员编制、教学设备、以及其他行政费开支方面还存在着使用不合理和铺张浪费的现象，今后必须坚决执行中央的指示，贯彻精简节约的政策。　　为贯彻实现五年计划，对上述这些问题，必须有计划、有步骤地加以解决，才能完成培养合格的高级建设干部这一重大任务。什么是“合格”的干部呢？李富春副总理的报告和林枫主任的发言中都明确地指出：我们培养的干部必须是忠实于祖国和社会主义建设、能够掌握现代科学知识和身体健康的人，也就是说，要培养真正合乎“身体好、学习好、工作好”要求的人才。拿这个尺度来衡量，则在我们的工作中显然是有严重缺点的。　　目前高等学校所培养的干部质量不高，虽有历史的、社会的各种原因，但主要原因还在于我们在贯彻执行方针政策上及在工作中存有缺点。在过去几年发展中，没有严肃地考虑到学生来源和师资条件都严重不足的情况，片面追求数量，对于保证质量注意不够，在培养工作中，也没有能够正确地贯彻全面发展的教育方针，对于健康教育注意较差，政治思想工作尤其薄弱；加上学习苏联、进行教学改革中，因为过去基础差，一切无异从头学起，自然师生都觉得忙迫吃力。由于这些原因，使我们所培养的干部不仅学习质量不高，赶不上国家建设的要求；而且由于学力不及、健康不佳、政治品质等等，因而每年流动淘汰率很大。举例来说，仅在一九五三至一九五四学年的一年中，全国高等学校在年终考试前休学、退学及被开除者达七千余人，约占本学年在校学生总数的百分之三点五，其中半数以上是因病不能坚持学习的，一部分是由于政治质量过差。这不仅影响了国家培养干部计划的顺利完成，而且给国家带来了人力、物力和财力上的很大浪费。下面我特别谈谈学生的政治质量情况。应该说，几年来我们高等学校学生的社会主义觉悟一般有了不少的提高，他们是热爱祖国、努力学习、遵守纪律、服从国家需要的。但这是一方面，主要的一面；另一方面，还有一小部分人政治质量很差，很难培养成为有用的人才，也是不容忽视的。有的是受了资产阶级思想的严重腐蚀，道德败坏，品质恶劣，生活腐化，甚至结成流氓集团，作违法乱纪的勾当。有些学生，反动思想严重，散布反动言论，不满社会主义，有的甚至形成了组织，如上海复旦大学、交通大学都曾破获过这样的反动集团。还有匪徒曾混入我们高等学校，如西北农学院最近就破获了一个曾经潜伏了三年多、伪装学习的程建安，原来是曾经多次袭击我抗日部队、打死我们干部、抢劫财物、欺压群众、血债累累的恶霸地主出身的反革命匪帮。还有敌人派到我们的学校里来进行反革命活动的，历年以来，常常发现反革命放火、放毒、偷窃文件、损坏机器仪器、张贴反动标语等破坏事故。虽然像上述这样的罪恶分子和政治上严重不纯分子为数不多，但如不及早加以清除和防止继续混入，则对国家的社会主义建设事业所可能造成的损害将是难以估计的。　　为了适应国家建设的需要，培养合格的高级建设人才，今后高等教育工作，必须以大力提高质量，特别要注意提高政治质量，为此，要进行下列几方面的工作。　　贯彻“保证质量，照顾数量”的方针，改进招生工作，提高新生质量。为了保证高等学校新生质量，国务院曾于今春研究了若干工业部门技术干部需要和使用情况，考虑了高等学校的各种条件，结合需要与可能，调整了今后三年的高等学校招生任务，并确定了改进招生工作的原则。今后高等学校招考新生，必须严格政治审查和健康检查，适当提高学科考试成绩录取的标准，录取的新生必须是政治可靠、学业能跟得上班、健康条件能够坚持学习的。并注意吸收工农青年、革命干部、复员建设军人、少数民族青年入学。当然，我们对新生质量的要求还不能脱离目前各方面的实际情况而一下子提得过高，同时对数量也不能完全不考虑。因此，应当是把质量和数量正确地结合起来，在保证一定质量的条件下，努力争取数量。
　　对在校学生也要根据当前要求，加以整顿。对有严重政治问题不堪培养，或品质极端恶劣，不堪造就的分子，必须坚决地加以清洗。对学业过差，或身体太坏，无法跟班或坚持学习的，则应分别情况另外予以适当的安排，这样对国家对学生个人都是有利的。自然，进行这样的整顿，是一个极为复杂而细致的工作，绝不可以草率从事。首先必须作好思想工作，讲清道理，不仅使学校师生，而且使社会各方面人士都了解国家培养干部的方针和保证质量的要求，才能顺利地贯彻上述措施。因此，就不能单靠行政力量来做，必须在中国共产党各级党委的领导下，并获得各民主党派、各人民团体、各界人士以及高等学校全体师生的一致协力，才可以做好这个工作。所以，我恳求各位代表对上述措施给予关怀和支持。
    提高新生录取水平和对现有在校学生进行整顿，以及国务院已经确定了的有计划、有步骤地改变高等学校学制，适当延长学习年限，逐步取消两年制和三年制的专修科等措施，无疑地都将为今后高等学校培养质量较高的干部提供了有利的条件。但是真正确保质量的最主要的环节，还在于高等学校本身能够切实改进各方面的工作，特别是教学工作。
    由于我国高等教育基础很差，而新中国建设需要高级建设人才却很迫切，数量既要多，质量又要好，大家（包括师生）努力学习苏联的先进科学技术，想很快地赶上去，就产生了有些要求不免偏高，有些措施不免偏急，结果招致了师生教学负担过重的弊害，影响了他们的健康，也程度不同地影响了他们对政治学习的关心。这首先应该检讨高等教育部领导工作中的缺点，而对广大师生的努力，则是应该给以鼓励的。最近我们和各高等学校正在积极贯彻全面发展的教育方针，本着“学少一点，学好一点”的原则，适当地修订了教学计划和教学大纲，并抓紧改进教学方法，改进教材和提高教学效果的工作，在许多学校中已收到初步成效。为了增强学生体质，除了开展体育锻炼外，高等教育部正在考虑适当地改变高等学校人民助学金的制度，使在不增加国家财力负担的条件下改善学生伙食与营养。　　不断加强马克思列宁主义教育是培养青年正确的世界观、提高社会主义觉悟、增强他们对资产阶级思想侵袭的抵抗力的根本方法。由于师资力量不足，四门政治理论课的教学质量一般不高，我们正在大力改进这方面的工作。随着全国开展宣传辩证唯物主义思想、批判唯心主义思想的运动，在高等学校学生中，也相当普遍地开展辩证唯物主义的学习。在青年团的协助下，培养青年共产主义道德品质的教育工作，也有所增强。我们更明确地提出了教师应树立对学生“全面发展”负责的思想，在教学活动中贯彻政治思想教育，培养与加强学习纪律，把“教学”与“教养”结合起来。这些都是高等学校首要的思想建设工作，需要我们长期努力的。　　保证培养干部质量的主要关键，在于教师的政治思想水平和业务水平的不断提高。教学工作就是思想工作，学生的思想同教师的思想影响是分不开的。为要提高教学质量，深入教师思想改造就显得特别重要。自去年开展对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判运动以来，暴露了在我们高等学校各学术部门里存在着大量的资产阶级唯心主义的错误思想。虽然大多数教师积极地参加了唯物主义的学习，但卷入批判资产阶级唯心主义思想斗争的人数还很不普遍，除文、史、哲学各系科外，其他系科还没有很好进行。不少荒谬的言论还在流传，没有受到应有的批判，例如抱着“政治不能领导科学”的错误观点的人还不能说是“极个别”的。为了有力地改进教学工作与科学研究工作，提高教学质量，使高等教育工作更好地为国家的社会主义建设服务，高等教育工作者应该大力加强马克思列宁主义的学习，彻底批判资产阶级唯心主义的错误思想，以进一步提高我们的政治觉悟和理论水平，深入思想改造，这样也才能够更好地学习苏联先进经验，提高我们的业务水平，从而提高培养干部的质量。　　通过最近揭发胡风反革命集团的斗争，我们更可以看到暗藏的反革命分子向学校进攻的严重性。既然胡风反革命集团如谢韬、贾植芳、吕荧等骨干分子能够混入我们高等学校，长期窃据讲坛，伪装人民教师，那末其他反革命分子当然也就可以混进来，云南大学最近揭露并已被公安机关逮捕的长期隐藏的反革命分子赵岑纪就是又一个例证。我们高等学校师生中绝大多数是好人，这是肯定的；但是如林枫主任发言所指出，忽视政治的倾向在我们许多人中间是严重的。由于缺乏警惕，就给了胡风分子和一切暗藏的反革命分子以钻空子的机会；由于嗅觉不灵，就使反动言论得以公开传播流行。我们应该通过这次肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，提高政治觉悟，把政治思想工作大大向前推进一步，彻底清除暗藏在我们队伍里面的反革命分子，保卫我国的社会主义建设事业顺利前进。我想，这将是各位代表对高等教育工作者的起码要求。我相信我们能够这样做。
    邓宝珊代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    在二十一日的会议上，陈云副总理的发言，就我国当前的粮食问题，作了极其精辟的说明，对我们有很大的启发和帮助。现在，我就甘肃的粮食问题、农民生活问题和农业增产讲一点意见。
    我在今年下乡视察以前，也听说甘肃某些地方农村粮食紧张。对于这个问题，我曾经从多方面作过考虑。是不是甘肃粮食不够呢？甘肃在历史上固然是缺粮的省份，现在这种情况已经有了很大的改变。全省一九五四年的粮食产量，要比一九五零年增加百分之五十，每个农业人口平均约有原粮六百斤。虽然有少数重灾区因连年歉收而缺粮，但就全省范围来说，已经不缺粮。是不是去年统购过头了呢？我也算了一下账，去年全省连征带购的粮食，不过占总产量的百分之十九，除过公粮和统购粮以外，每个农业人口平均还有原粮约五百斤，基本上是够吃够用的。是不是统销太少了呢？以一九五五粮食年度的农村销售量来计算，每人每年平均按一百二十斤供应，可以供应二百七十多万人，占农业人口的四分之一以上，再加去年大部地区又是丰收，这个供应数字应该说是只多不少的。所有这些，都不能是农村粮食紧张的原因。
    那末，农村粮食紧张的真正原因究竟何在？我从这次视察农村中得到了解答。据我了解，在个别地区，对少数农户，由于工作上的缺点，确有过统购过头和该供应的没有及时供应的情形，但大多已经作了纠正，有的正在纠正中。而供应面偏宽，供应量偏大，则是比较普遍的现象。拿我视察会宁县甘沟乡和榆中县符家川乡来说，前一个乡是连遭旱灾三年的重灾区，粮食供应面为全乡人口的百分之八十六，群众情绪安定，粮食并不紧张，逢集还有两三千斤粮上市；后一个乡去年夏田歉收，秋田平收，供应面达到百分之九十五，而群众情绪反不安定，粮食十分紧张。如果说符家川乡的缺粮程度超过甘沟乡，这是不合乎事实的。但是符家川乡的供应面这样大，而粮食还是这样紧张。这就进一步说明，农村粮食紧张现象，并不是缺粮或者供应不足所造成的。事实上，叫喊缺粮的固然有些是真正缺粮户，而大部分并不缺粮。有的是怕露富，有的是怕遭灾，想多买点粮食备荒。我们对农民的宣传教育工作做得不够，工作方法上有某些缺点，也是事实。而地主、富农分子和反革命分子则利用农民私有者这方面的弱点和我们工作中的某些缺点，从中挑拨煽惑，企图破坏我们的粮食政策和工农联盟，特别是在某些工作基础比较薄弱的边沿地区，更是严重。所有这些，才是造成农村粮食紧张的真正原因。这一方面正是反映了小农经济与社会主义计划经济的矛盾，另一方面也是反映了过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。许多农民同我谈话时，对国家粮食统购统销政策是热烈拥护的，尤其是灾区群众，更是衷心感激。他们异口同声地对我说：“要不是共产党和人民政府，实行统购统销，这样的灾荒不知要饿死多少人。”他们把粮食统销叫做“三保险”，就是保险有粮，保险不涨价，保险不受剥削。有不少本来不缺粮也跟着叫喊的农民，经过“三定”宣传以后，也自动退出了购粮证，榆中县自动退出购粮证的农户，占全县供应户数的百分之十二。由此可见，只要我们继续正确贯彻统购统销政策和“三定”办法，更加细致地做好思想教育工作，并打击一切反革命分子的活动，某些地方的粮食紧张现象，就可以消除，供应也可以更加合理。而农民要求我们的，也正是如此。
    再说农民生活改善的问题，有人也表示过怀疑。这个问题，我想从以下两个方面来说明：一方面是农村中中农增加了。据甘肃六个专区的七个县的重点调查，土地改革时的贫农，已经有百分之八十上升为新中农。另一方面，农业产量逐年增加。从一九五零年到一九五四年，平均每年递增百分之八点六。农村居民购买力，一九五四年比一九五零年增加两倍多。一九四九年每百斤小麦只能换一丈五尺白布，现在已能换到五丈。拿我亲自访问的定西县仁化农业生产合作社为例，去年全社每人收入粮食一千多斤。以上这些都说明解放以来农民生活已经有了显著的改善。那种认为农民生活没有改善，甚至好像连解放前都不如的说法，显然是十分错误的。几年来，人民政府用了很大力量从各方面扶助农民发展生产。单是一九五零年到现在，甘肃的农业投资、贷款和农村救济费，就相当于一九五二到一九五四年三年的农业税总额的百分之一百一十。那种认为对农民要的多、给的少的说法，也是不符合事实的。　　从这两个问题上，我深深体会到，有些事情在是非真假没有弄清以前，我们最好不要轻易相信；否则，不但对革命事业不利，甚至还会上当。特别是多到农村去看看，多同群众谈谈，就可以更多地了解实际情况，这对于我们来说，更是有很大好处的。　　努力发展农业，增加粮食产量，是我们甘肃在第一个五年计划期间的一项重要任务。甘肃农业生产的特点是，各地区之间的自然条件，像气温的高低，雨量的多寡，无霜期的长短，土地的质量和作物的种类等，都有很大的差别。全省有大型水利灌溉区、干旱区、高山多雨区、高原丘陵区、牧业区、林业区以及其他等八类地区，在这样情况下，农业生产固然受自然条件的一定限制，但增产潜力也还没有充分发挥，发展前途是很远大的。目前农业增产的根本办法，是要开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。甘肃目前有农业生产合作社六千三百十四个。据我在五个农业生产合作社的了解，这些社都办得好，老社去年增产百分之十五到二十，新社在今年春耕和夏季生产中都有显著成绩。各地群众的社会主义觉悟和互助合作积极性普遍高涨。今后应该积极发展农业合作化运动。我们计划到一九五七年，参加农业生产合作社的农户将达到农户总数的百分之四十左右；粮食产量将比一九五二年增加百分之三十二。与开展农业合作化运动的同时，我们还要更好地采取各种有效的增产措施。在甘肃来说，首先要发展水利，因为甘肃绝大部分地区雨量较少，发展水利对农业增产是具有决定性的一个因素。根据几年来的经验，一般旱地变为水地，产量就能增加一倍。甘肃的水利潜力很大，单是酒泉、武威两个专区的水量，如果加以充分利用，就可以使一千万亩荒地变为良田。即使在干旱地区，也有很多地下水源，群众说：“三山夹一嘴，嘴嘴都有水”。我们要发动群众的力量，把雨水、地面水和地下水尽可能地用来发展灌溉。同时，还要展开综合性的水土保持工作，把农业、林业、畜牧业和水利互相结合起来，逐步改变自然面貌。这个工作，对于甘肃农业增产和治理黄河，都有重要作用。再是要根据因地制宜的原则，适当地调整各类作物的分布面积，提倡间种和复种。银川专区今年实行间种，估计可以增产秋粮三千万斤。在定西等干旱区因为春季缺雨，雨量多集中在秋季，要扩大秋季作物的播种面积。在山区和缺粮地区，多种薯类、玉米等高产作物。在酒泉、武威等地区，除大力发展水利增产粮食以外，还可以大量发展棉田。初步调查，这些地区共约有宜棉地四百多万亩，每亩产量约在四十斤以上。总之，只要我们能够适应各种不同的地区，正确地采取各种不同的增产措施，甘肃的农业生产就可以不断发展。这样，不但可以更好地适应各方面的需要，改善各族人民的生活，并且可以对国家的社会主义建设事业贡献更多的力量。　　实现第一个五年计划是一个伟大而艰巨的任务。我们必须在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，依照国家计划，充分发扬各族人民的积极性和劳动热情，挖掘各方面的潜在力量，兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约，保证第一个五年计划的胜利完成。
