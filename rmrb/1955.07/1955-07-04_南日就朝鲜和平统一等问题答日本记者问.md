Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 3rd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nan Ri, met with “Asahi Shimbun” reporter Tadashi Wada and Kyodo News reporter Masaki Nagamine on the 2nd. During the meeting, Nan Ri answered some questions raised by the Japanese reporters.

　　When answering the question about the peaceful reunification of Korea, Nan Ri pointed out that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had already proposed steps for the peaceful reunification of Korea at the Geneva Conference. We have consistently strived to promote various contacts between North and South Korea in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. We will continue to make such efforts in the future.

　　The reunification of Korea has not yet been realized due to the obstruction of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. We hope that an international conference attended by relevant countries concerned with the final settlement of the Korean issue will be held soon and will produce positive results.

　　A Japanese reporter asked if Korea hoped that the upcoming four-power summit would discuss the Korean issue. Nan Ri replied: According to what is already known about the four-power summit, the issues to be discussed at the meeting will be decided by the four heads of state. However, we hope that the four-power summit will discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and produce positive results.

　　Japanese reporters asked some questions about the relationship between Korea and Japan. Nan Ri said: The Japanese delegation that recently visited Korea had contacts with representatives from the economic, scientific, and cultural circles of Korea in order to promote economic and cultural exchanges between Korea and Japan. Recently, the Korean International Trade Promotion Committee has responded to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association's proposal to send a Japanese trade delegation to Korea, inviting the Japanese trade delegation to Pyongyang around July 20 this year.

　　Nan Ri also said: The government of the Republic is actively cooperating with the work of the Korean Red Cross in order to quickly realize the repatriation of some of the Japanese residents now living in the northern part of the Republic who wish to return to their country. Japanese people living in the Republic are treated as foreigners in accordance with the decisions of the Korean government. It is not true that some Japanese officials have described the life of Japanese people in Korea as bleak.

　　Nan Ri believes that the work of repatriating Japanese residents can be realized this year. Speaking of the issue of Korean residents in Japan, Nan Ri pointed out that there are many facts of persecution against Korean residents. He said that the government of the Republic believes that the Japanese government should guarantee, and also hopes that it will guarantee, the rights of Korean residents in Japan recognized by international law.

　　Nan Ri also stated that the government of the Republic welcomes it if the Japanese government is willing to negotiate on the issue of Korean residents in Japan.

　　南日就朝鲜和平统一等问题答日本记者问
    新华社平壤三日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在二日接见了日本“朝日新闻”记者和田齐和共同社记者永峰正树。在接见时，南日答复了日本记者所提出的一些问题。
    南日在答复朝鲜和平统一的问题时指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经在日内瓦会议上提出了和平统一朝鲜的步骤。我们一贯地努力促使北朝鲜和南朝鲜进行种种联系，以便促进朝鲜的和平统一。将来我们仍将继续作这种努力。
    由于美国和李承晚集团的阻挠，朝鲜的统一至今还未实现。我们希望很快就会举行由关切朝鲜问题最后解决的有关国家参加的国际会议，并将产生积极的结果。
    日本记者问起朝鲜是否希望即将举行的四国首脑会议讨论朝鲜问题。南日回答说：据已经知道的关于四国首脑会议的事，在会议上讨论的问题将由四国首脑去决定。但是，我们希望，四国首脑会议上将进行关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，并将产生积极的结果。
    日本记者问到一些有关朝鲜和日本的关系的问题。南日说：最近访问了朝鲜的日本代表团曾经同朝鲜经济、科学和文化界的代表们进行接触，以便促进朝鲜和日本两国之间的经济和文化交流。最近朝鲜国际贸易促进委员会已经答复了日本国际贸易促进协会关于派遣一个日本贸易代表团来朝鲜的建议，请日本贸易代表团在今年七月二十日左右来平壤。
    南日又说：共和国政府正在对朝鲜红十字会的工作给予积极的合作，以便迅速实现现在住在共和国北部的日本侨民当中愿意回国的一些人的遣送工作。住在共和国的日本人，按照朝鲜政府的决定，都受着外侨的待遇。某些日本官方人士形容在朝鲜的日本人过着黯淡的生活，这是不符合事实的。
    南日认为，遣送日本侨民工作能够在今年内实现。谈到关于在日本的朝鲜侨民问题时，南日指出，有不少朝鲜侨民遭到迫害的事实，他说，共和国政府认为，日本政府应当保证，并且也希望它将会保证在日本的朝鲜侨民有国际法所公认的权利。
    南日还表示，如果日本政府愿意谈判在日本的朝鲜侨民问题，共和国政府是欢迎的。
