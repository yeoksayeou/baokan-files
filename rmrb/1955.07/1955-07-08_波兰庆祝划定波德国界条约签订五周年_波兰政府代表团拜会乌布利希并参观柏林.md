Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 7th: The Polish people warmly celebrated the fifth anniversary (July 6th) of the signing of the treaty between Poland and Germany on the demarcation of their national border. Celebrations were held in major cities such as Warsaw, Wrocław, Poznań, and Białystok.

	A grand celebration was held in Warsaw on the 6th, hosted by the All-Poland Committee of the National Front. Five thousand people attended. Polish United Workers' Party and state leaders such as Zawadzki and Cyrankiewicz, as well as the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, attended the celebration.

	Cyrankiewicz emphasized in his speech the great significance of the treaty on the demarcation of the Polish-German border for strengthening the good-neighborly relations of peace between Poland and the German Democratic Republic and for safeguarding peace in Europe.

	Subsequently, on behalf of the Polish Council of State, Zawadzki presented the Order of Polonia Restituta, First and Second Class, to Prime Minister Grotewohl and Deputy Prime Minister Bolz respectively, praising their outstanding contributions in the struggle to consolidate peace and strengthen Polish-German friendship.

	Grotewohl spoke at the meeting. He said that, in the final analysis, the sacred friendship between the new Poland and the new Germany is what will determine war and peace in Europe. The vast majority of the German people, like the Polish people, do not want war.

	On the 6th, Warsaw newspapers published extensive coverage of the festival, including news, commentaries, and articles. An editorial in "People's Tribune" pointed out that since the signing of this treaty five years ago, German-Polish relations have entered a new stage. In its first official document, the German Democratic Republic recognized the Oder-Neisse line as an inviolable border of peace and friendship. The existence of the German Democratic Republic tells the revanchists in West Germany that they can no longer enslave the whole of Germany, and that they are opposed not only by the European people who suffered under Hitler's tyranny, but also by the German people, primarily the German Democratic Republic. Today, when the Soviet Union's peace policy has opened up broad prospects for easing international tensions and seriously undermined the war plans of those who pursue a "policy of strength," Polish-German friendship is of particular importance. This friendship will stop American and West German politicians from trying to obstruct the normalization of relations with West Germany and impede the Four Power Conference by playing tricks with the issue of Poland's western territories.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 7th: The Polish government delegation headed by Beirut, which came to participate in the fifth anniversary commemoration of the signing of the treaty on the demarcation of the border between Poland and the German Democratic Republic, paid a visit to Ulbricht, the Acting Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, on the 5th.

	On the 6th, the Polish government delegation, accompanied by Ebert, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and Mayor of Greater Berlin, toured Berlin. The delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere.

	On the same day, the delegation also went to the Treptow Park in Berlin and the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery, laying wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial and the tombs of outstanding activists of the German workers' movement.

    波兰庆祝划定波德国界条约签订五周年
    波兰政府代表团拜会乌布利希并参观柏林
    新华社华沙七日电　波兰人民热烈庆祝波德两国关于划定两国国界的条约签订五周年（七月六日）。华沙、弗罗茨拉夫、波兹南、比亚里斯多克等大城市都举行了庆祝会。
    由波兰全国阵线全波委员会主办的盛大庆祝会六日在华沙举行。到会的有五千人。波兰统一工人党和国家的领导人萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等和以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团都出席了庆祝会。
    西伦凯维兹在会上讲话时着重指出了关于划定德波两国国界的条约对加强波兰和德意志民主共和国之间和平善邻关系和维护欧洲和平的重大意义。
    接着萨瓦茨基代表波兰国务委员会分别把一级和二级波兰复兴勋章授给格罗提渥总理和博尔茨副总理，表扬他们在巩固和平和加强波德友好关系的斗争中的卓越贡献。
    格罗提渥在会上讲了话。他说，最后分析起来，新波兰和新德国的神圣友谊是决定欧洲的战争与和平的。德国绝大多数人民和波兰人民一样，是不要战争的。
      六日，华沙各报以大量篇幅刊载了庆祝节日的消息、评论和文章。“人民论坛报”的社论指出，自从五年以前这个条约签订以来，德国和波兰的关系就开始了一个新的阶段。德意志民主共和国在它的第一个正式文件中就承认奥得—尼斯河分界线是和平友谊的不可侵犯的边界。德意志民主共和国的存在就告诉西德的复仇主义者：他们已不能再奴役整个德国，反对他们的不仅有遭受过希特勒蹂躏的欧洲人民，还有德国人民，其中最主要的就是德意志民主共和国。今天，当苏联的和平政策已为缓和国际紧张局势开辟了广阔的远景并严重打击了“实力政策”的奉行者的战争计划的时候，波德两国的友谊就有特别重要的意义。这种友谊将制止美国和西德政客们企图借波兰西部土地问题，玩弄旨在阻挠同西德关系的正常化、阻挠四大国会议的把戏。
    新华社柏林七日电　前来参加波德两国签订两国国界条约五周年纪念的以贝鲁特为首的波兰政府代表团，五日拜会了德意志民主共和国代总理、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希。
    六日，波兰政府代表团由德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、大柏林市长艾柏特陪同在柏林进行了参观。代表团到处都受到热烈的欢迎。
    同一天，代表团还到柏林特莱普托夫公园和腓特烈公墓，分别在苏军烈士纪念碑和德国工人运动杰出活动家的墓前献花圈。
