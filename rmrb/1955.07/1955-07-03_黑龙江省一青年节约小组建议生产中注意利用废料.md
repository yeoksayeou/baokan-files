　　A Youth Conservation Group in Heilongjiang Province Suggests Paying Attention to the Use of Waste Materials in Production
    A youth conservation group from the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant in Heilongjiang Province recently proposed that young workers in Heilongjiang Province should make extensive use of leftover and waste materials to replace raw materials in production, thereby saving wealth for the country, on the premise of ensuring quality and without increasing working hours. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League has made a decision to support this initiative. The decision requires youth league organizations in enterprises throughout the province to discuss this initiative, and to organize youth conservation teams in a planned and led manner to carry out mass voluntary labor to recover waste materials in their spare time. The decision also points out that if all young workers in the province pay attention to the rational use of materials, actively utilize waste materials, participate in the work of recovering waste materials, and resolutely fight against waste, they will save a large amount of steel for the country and accumulate more funds. At the same time, the socialist consciousness of young workers throughout the province will be further enhanced in this struggle.
    After studying the deeds of the Xing Shouyuan group of the Heilongjiang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in continuously improving labor productivity, this youth conservation group further enhanced its socialist consciousness. Seeing the great waste in the factory in terms of raw material storage and use, they automatically used holidays and spare time to pick up leftover materials and tried to use them to replace good materials for production. The main obstacles they encountered in using leftover materials were the fear of increased working hours and affecting product quality. In the beginning, the use of leftover materials did increase working hours. Later, after improving operations, improving tools, and increasing production efficiency, the problem of increased working hours was solved, and they were able to break through the work quota. In order to prevent an increase in defective and substandard products, they handed over the picked-up leftover materials to veteran workers and technicians for appraisal and testing. Only after it was proven that the quality would not be affected were they adopted in large quantities.
    From January to May 20th this year, this youth conservation group has used over 8,600 kilograms of waste materials instead of good iron to manufacture more than 28,000 parts. Their experience has been promoted in the forging workshop of the plant. Ten groups in the entire workshop have utilized more than 88,000 kilograms of waste materials. Now, this youth conservation group and the forging workshop have both formulated plans to further utilize waste materials to save raw materials.

### 黑龙江省一青年节约小组建议生产中注意利用废料

　　黑龙江省一青年节约小组建议生产中注意利用废料
    黑龙江省齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂锻工青年节约小组最近提出了一项创议，建议黑龙江省青年职工在保证质量和不增加工时的前提下，大量利用残、废材料代替原材料进行生产，为国家节约财富。青年团黑龙江省委已经作出决定，支持这个创议。决定要求全省企业中的团组织讨论这个创议，有计划有领导地组织青年节约队，利用业余时间开展群众性的收回残废料的义务劳动。决定并指出，如果全省青年职工都注意合理用材，积极利用废料，参加收回废料的工作，坚决同浪费现象作斗争，就将为国家节省大量钢铁和积累更多的资金，同时，全省青年职工的社会主义觉悟，也将在这一斗争中进一步提高。
    这个青年节约小组学习了黑龙江第一机械厂邢守元小组不断提高劳动生产率的事迹以后，社会主义觉悟进一步提高。他们看到工厂中在原材料保管和使用方面浪费很大，便自动利用假日和业余时间拣残料，并设法利用残料代替好料进行生产。他们在利用残料中遇到的主要障碍，是怕费工时和影响产品质量。在开始采用残料时，也的确曾使工时增多。后来，经过改进操作，改进工具，提高生产效率，费工时的问题就解决了，而且能突破工时定额。为了防止增加废品和次品，他们把拣回来的残料，都交由老工人和技术员进行鉴定试验，经证明能够不影响质量以后才大批采用。
    从今年一月份到五月二十日止，这个青年节约小组已经利用残废料代替八千六百多公斤好铁，制造了二万八千多个部件。他们的经验已经在本厂锻冶车间推广。全车间已经有十个小组利用了八万八千多公斤残料。现在，这个青年节约小组和锻冶车间都制定了进一步利用残料节约原材料的计划。
