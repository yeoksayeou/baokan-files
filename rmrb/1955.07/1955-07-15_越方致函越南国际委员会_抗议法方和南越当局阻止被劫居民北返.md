Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 14th: The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam wrote a letter to the Commission on July 11th, protesting the French Federal Forces and the South Vietnamese authorities' obstruction of the return to the North of residents who were abducted and transported to the South.

The letter stated that although the French Federal Forces, in principle, agreed to the International Commission's suggestion to extend the date for free movement of residents between the two sides to after July 20th, the South Vietnamese authorities have been trying all means to obstruct residents from coming to the North. The letter then listed many facts of the French side preventing residents from returning to the North, such as taking repressive measures against those returning to the North, not issuing passes, and not allowing them to contact the International Commission. The letter also mentioned a statement published in the newspaper by the South Vietnamese authorities' "General Migration Committee," which stated that the committee would not issue passes to anyone applying to return to the North after May 19th, on the pretext that detailed rules for implementing the extension of free movement to July 20th had not yet been agreed upon between the two sides.

The letter then emphasized that the aforementioned actions and statements by the South Vietnamese authorities in obstructing the free movement of Southern residents to the North violated the agreements reached between the two sides and the principle agreement of both sides to the International Commission's suggestion of May 28th.

The letter finally requested the International Commission to take prompt measures to ensure the implementation of the International Commission's suggestion of May 28th regarding continuing to provide facilities to those wishing to migrate.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 14th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, on July 7th, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army submitted a protest to the French Federal Forces, once again protesting the French side's violation of Items F of Article 16 and Item E of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords, transporting many troops, military personnel, weapons, ammunition, and war materials into and out of Vietnam without reporting to the Joint Armistice Commission and the International Commission. In the past, after the Vietnamese side raised protests, the French side had admitted these actions, but defended themselves by saying that they were too busy with other important matters and forgot to notify the Joint Armistice Commission.

While submitting the protest on July 7th, the Vietnamese delegation requested the French side to report on the issues of troops, weapons, ammunition, and war materials that they had transported into and out of Vietnam since the ceasefire agreement came into effect, and demanded that for every future change, the French side should promptly notify the Joint Armistice Commission in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the detailed rules of the Vietnam Joint Armistice Commission agreement.

    越方致函越南国际委员会
    抗议法方和南越当局阻止被劫居民北返
    新华社河内十四日电  越南人民军总司令部驻越南国际监督和监察委员会的联络代表团在七月十一日写给委员会一封信，抗议法兰西联邦部队方面和越南南方当局阻止被劫运到南方去的居民重返北方。
    信中说，在国际委员会建议将双方居民自由迁移日期延期到七月二十日以后，虽然法兰西联邦部队方面曾在原则上同意这个建议，但是越南南方当局一直在想尽一切办法阻挠居民到北方来。信中接着列举了许多法方阻止居民北返的事实，例如对北返的人采取镇压措施和不发通行证以及不使他们同国际委员会接触等。信中还提到了越南南方当局的“总迁移委员会”在报上发表的一项声明，这个委员会在五月十九日以后就不发通行证给申请北返的任何人，借口是双方之间还未达成履行自由迁居延期到七月二十日的细节规则。
    信中接着强调指出，越南南方当局上述阻挠南方居民自由迁往北方的这种行为和说法，是违背双方所取得的协议和双方对五月二十八日国际委员会的建议在原则上的同意的作法的。
    信中最后要求国际委员会迅速采取措施以保证履行国际委员会五月二十八日关于继续给予希望迁移者以便利的建议。
    新华社河内十四日电据越南通讯社讯：七月七日，越南人民军总司令部代表团向法兰西联邦部队方面提出抗议书，再一次抗议法方违反日内瓦协定十六条己项和十七条戊项，在越南运出和运入许多部队、军事人员、武器、弹药和战争物资，而不向联合停战委员会和国际委员会报告。过去，在越方提出抗议后，法方已经承认这些行为，但又辩护说，这是由于忙于别的重要的事情，而忘记通知联合停战委员会。
    越方代表团在七月七日提出抗议的同时，要求法方就停战协定生效以来它们运入和运出越南的军队、武器、弹药和战争物资问题作出报告，并且要求法方对于今后的每一次变动，要按照日内瓦协定和越南联合停战委员会协议的细则，及时地通知联合停战委员会。
