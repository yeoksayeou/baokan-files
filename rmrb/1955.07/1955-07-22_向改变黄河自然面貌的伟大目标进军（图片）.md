Marching Towards the Great Goal of Changing the Natural Appearance of the Yellow River

    Vice Premier Deng Zihui of the State Council of the People's Republic of China delivered a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Fundamentally Controlling the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing Water Conservancy" at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. This report, for the first time in Chinese history, comprehensively proposed a grand plan to completely eliminate the Yellow River's disasters on a large scale and to utilize the Yellow River to develop irrigation, power generation, and shipping.

    The comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water disasters and developing water conservancy includes a long-term plan and a first-phase plan. The main content of the Yellow River's long-term plan is to transform the Yellow River into a "terraced river" by building forty-six dams on the Yellow River's main stream, twenty-four reservoirs on important tributaries, and conducting large-scale soil and water conservation work in the upper and middle reaches. After the full implementation of this plan, the Yellow River will become a tamed river; a huge main stream for agricultural irrigation; and a river with strong power and developed shipping. The first phase of the Yellow River plan, which will be implemented from now until 1967, will lay a good foundation for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. The primary task for achieving the first phase of the plan is to actively complete the design and construction preparation of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations to ensure that the project starts on time.

    Since liberation, the People's Government has led the people along the river every year to renovate and reinforce the Yellow River dikes, and solid rubble revetment projects have been built on many dangerous dike sections. Xinhua News Agency photo

    向改变黄河自然面貌的伟大目标进军
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理邓子恢代表国务院在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。这个报告在我国历史上第一次全面地提出了大规模地彻底消除黄河灾害，利用黄河发展灌溉、发电和航运事业的宏伟计划。
    根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，包括远景计划和第一期计划。黄河远景计划的主要内容就是要把黄河改造成为“梯河”，在黄河干流上修建拦河坝四十六座，在重要的支流上修建二十四个水库，并在上、中游进行大规模的水土保持工作。这个计划全部实现后，黄河将成为一条驯服的河流；成为一条农业灌溉的巨大的干流；成为一条有强大动力和航运发达的河流。从现在到一九六七年实施的黄河规划的第一期计划，将为根治黄河打下良好的基础。实现第一期计划当前的首要任务就是积极完成三门峡和刘家峡水电站的设计和施工准备，保证这个工程按时开工。
