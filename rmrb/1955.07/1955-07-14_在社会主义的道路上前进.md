Shanghai's Major Steel Plants Increase Production of Many Steel Products in the First Half of the Year

Shanghai's major steel plants increased the production of steel products worth more than 11.0 million yuan in the first half of the year. Among them, the output of the main products—steel and steel materials—increased by 40 to 44 percent compared with the same period last year.

These steel plants only spent a small amount of money on technical organizational measures in the first half of the year, and they tapped great potential from the original equipment. The original crane load capacity of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant was small, which limited the potential of each open-hearth furnace. After replacing it with a larger crane in April, the output of the furnace increased by 14 percent. Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant adopted measures such as deepening the steel ladle and strengthening the crane, and the furnace output of each open-hearth furnace also increased by nearly 10 percent. The converter workshop of this plant further strengthened the coordination between the iron smelting furnace, converter, and crane sections in the first half of the year, which greatly shortened the idle time between each furnace of steel, and produced 438 more furnaces of steel.

The First Lubricating Oil Workshop Put into Production

China's first automated lubricating oil workshop has been completed and put into production. This workshop can refine various types of lubricating oil urgently needed by the country from heavy oil, which was originally used as low-grade fuel, through processes such as vacuum distillation, furfural refining, solvent dewaxing, and clay filtration, to meet the needs of industry, transportation, and national defense.

In the months after this lubricating oil workshop was put into production, most of the equipment reached or even exceeded the design targets. In May, this workshop overfulfilled the state plan by 54 percent, and the product quality fully met the specifications. (Qiang Hongchen)

Two Coke Ovens of Anshan Iron and Steel Company Put into Production

On July 11, two reconstructed coke ovens of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were put into production. On the morning of the 12th, the first batch of coke was pushed out of the newly completed coke oven. Preliminary identification proved that the coke quality was very good. So far, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has completed the reconstruction of eight coke ovens.

With the help of Soviet experts, these two coke ovens were put into production five days ahead of the state plan. The bricklaying time for each coke oven was 63 days, which was more than a month shorter than the bricklaying time for the two coke ovens that were put into production at the beginning of March this year, and the labor force used was also reduced by one-third.

Using Large Blasting Method to Change the Course of the Jialing River

On July 8, at the Sandushui construction site south of Shuangshipu on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the road construction personnel used a large blasting method to change the course of the Jialing River. At noon that day, people watched from one kilometer away from the blasting site. They only heard a deafening roar, and in an instant, sand and stones flew across the sky, and more than 12,000 cubic meters of rock in the gorge were blown apart. A thick black column of smoke rose from the river surface. After the smoke column gradually turned into a diffuse white smoke and dissipated with the wind, people clearly saw with telescopes that the gorge that had been blocking the Jialing River had been blasted with a long strip-shaped river channel gap. The raging flood of the Jialing River flowed forward along this newly opened river channel.

In this area, the Jialing River originally flowed around the mountain, forming a slender horse's mouth shape. The railway needs to build two bridges to pass through the horse's mouth-shaped river surface. Now that the Jialing River channel is straightened, one of the two bridges originally planned to be built on the Jialing River can be saved. The remaining bridge only needs to cross a tributary, and the scale of the bridge will be much smaller. In this way, the project can also be free from the impact of the flood season.

It is the first time in the history of railway construction in our country to use the large blasting method to change the river course. This was a suggestion made by Soviet blasting expert Chichkin after observing the construction site. He helped modify the design of the large blasting construction before the blasting, and rushed from Baoji to the construction site more than 100 kilometers away overnight to guide the construction.

Two Workshops of Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory Completed

The Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, which started construction in April 1954, has already completed two workshops: the tool workshop and the machine repair workshop. On the afternoon of the 6th, the machines in these two workshops manufactured tools and machine tool spare parts such as lead screws and drill chuck rods for the first time during the load test run, which were needed for the plant to put into production. After inspection, the quality was good.

The tool workshop and the machine repair workshop are the first workshops of the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory to be put into production. In the next few days, the heat treatment workshop and the carpentry workshop will also be put into production. These workshops will produce tools, molds, and spare parts for machine tools used in the manufacture of automobile meters and switchboard meters.

Rich Mineral Deposits Discovered in Zunyi Area, Guizhou

After more than a year of general survey by geological personnel in the area near Zunyi City, Guizhou Province, it has been proved to be a stable manganese deposit with stable mineral layers. At present, geological personnel are conducting drilling to provide the country with mining data. Rich reserves of phosphorus and sulfur ore and other minerals have also been discovered in this area. These minerals that have been discovered have been scientifically identified and are of good quality.

The manganese ore being drilled generally has a very high manganese content. The phosphorus ore that has been tested many times has proven to be one of the highest quality phosphorus ores being mined in our country. The newly discovered sulfur ore also has a sulfur content of about 40 to 50 percent.

The large-scale discovery of phosphorus and sulfur ore, coupled with the large amount of saltpeter ore contained in nearby Zheng'an County, solves the problem of the main raw materials required by the Zunyi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, a local state-owned enterprise in Guizhou Province that is currently designing a superphosphate factory.

A Group of Automobile Drivers from Jiangsu Go to Tibet

Fifty automobile drivers from eight cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuxi, who voluntarily signed up to support the construction of Tibet, set off from Nanjing on the morning of July 9. Among them are Zhang Quanlin, a labor model with 100,000 kilometers of safe driving, Luan Linyong, an expert in saving fuel, and Chen Jie, a meritorious person in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and other outstanding figures.

Before departing, this group of drivers read the report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, and were greatly encouraged. Wu Liangfu, a young driver from Nanjing Automobile Transportation Company who was the first to sign up to support Tibet, said excitedly: "The report of the five-year plan made me see more clearly the beautiful prospects of the motherland. After I arrive in Tibet, I will never let down the country's expectations of me, and I will definitely contribute my greatest strength to the transportation cause in the border areas of the motherland."

Production Troops of Xinjiang Military Region Reclaim Large Amounts of Wasteland

Xinjiang Province plans to reclaim more than 600,000 mu of wasteland this year on both sides of the Tianshan Mountains and establish a number of state-owned farms. At present, the production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region are working intensively on this reclamation work. They have dispatched 184 tractors and 20 bulldozers to participate in the reclamation. During the reclamation, the work progressed rapidly due to the enthusiastic labor competition launched by the tractor drivers and the full play of machine efficiency. A detachment in the Urumqi Reclamation Area reclaimed an average of 10 mu of wasteland per tractor per hour. From mid-May to mid-June, this detachment has reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of wasteland. This winter, a part of these newly reclaimed wastelands will be planted with winter crops according to the rotation plan.

Before the reclamation, the Xinjiang Province Wasteland Survey and Design Bureau conducted a comprehensive survey and design of this wasteland in accordance with the requirements of the state-owned farm plan, and made precise designs for scientific irrigation, drainage, forest belts, roads, and the planning and layout of cultivated land strips.

Many New Orchards Built in Southern Mountainous Areas of Fujian

This year, many barren hills in the southern mountainous areas of Fujian Province have been developed by farmers into new orchards. According to statistics from Zhao'an, Zhangpu, Nan'an, and other counties: A total of more than 490,000 fruit trees of 12 kinds, including citrus, tangerines, peaches, plums, lychees, and longans, have been planted in the mountain orchards newly opened this year. The survival rate of these fruit trees is about 90 percent.

Recently, agricultural technology extension stations in various counties in the southern mountainous areas have either started fruit farmer training courses or sent technical cadres deep into the mountain villages to help the owners of new orchards learn how to manage the orchards. Zhao'an County has started a fruit farmer training course in Zoumatang Village, which has a history of planting citrus and tangerines in the mountains for more than 100 years. After on-site observation, the fruit farmers have great confidence in "fruit trees going up the mountains."

At present, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various places in the southern mountainous areas are continuing to reclaim barren hills and arrange terraced fields, preparing to plant another batch of fruit trees after the autumn harvest. State-owned farms have prepared more than 50,000 fruit tree seedlings for farmers to transplant. (Xinhua News Agency)

     在社会主义的道路上前进
    上海主要钢铁厂上半年增产许多钢铁产品
    上海几家主要的钢铁厂上半年增产了价值一千一百多万元的钢铁产品。其中主要的产品——钢和钢材的产量，比去年同期增长了百分之四十到四十四。
    这些钢铁厂上半年只花了很少的技术组织措施经费，就挖掘出原有设备很大的潜力。上海第三钢厂原来的行车载重量较小，限制了每座平炉潜力的发挥。四月份换了一部较大的行车以后，炉的产量提高了百分之十四。上海第一钢厂采取加深盛钢桶。加固行车等措施以后，每座平炉的炉产量也提高了近百分之十。这个厂的转炉车间，上半年又进一步加强了化铁炉、转炉、行车等工段之间的配合，使每炉钢之间的空闲时间缩短很多，多炼出四百三十八炉钢。　（新华社）
    第一个润滑油车间投入生产
    我国第一个自动化的润滑油车间已经建成并投入生产。这个车间经过减压蒸馏、糠醛精制、溶剂脱腊、白土过滤等工序，可以从原来用作低级燃料的重质石油中，提炼出国家迫切需要的各种品种的润滑油来，满足工业、交通运输业和国防上的需要。
    这个润滑油车间投入生产以后的几个月中，大多数设备都达到甚至超过了设计指标。五月份，这个车间超额百分之五十四完成了国家计划，产品质量完全合乎规格。　（强宏琛）
    鞍钢两座炼焦炉投入生产
    七月十一日，鞍山钢铁公司又有两座改建的炼焦炉投入生产。十二日清晨，从刚完工的炼焦炉里推出了第一炉焦炭。初步鉴定证明焦炭质量很好。至此，鞍钢已完成了八个炼焦炉的改建工作。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，这两座炼焦炉比国家计划提前五天投入生产。炼焦炉的砌砖时间各为六十三天，比今年三月初才投入生产的两座炼焦炉的砌砖时间缩短了一个多月，而使用的劳动力也减少了三分之一。　（新华社）
    用大爆破法改移嘉陵江河道
    七月八日，宝成铁路双石铺以南的三渡水工地上，筑路工程人员采用大爆破法，改移了嘉陵江河道。那天中午，人们在爆破地点一公里外观看，只听得轰然一声震天巨响，刹那间，沙石横飞，山峡的一万二千多方的石头顿时被炸裂开来。浓黑的烟柱从江面腾空而起。等烟柱逐渐变成弥漫的白烟随风散失后，人们用望远镜清楚地看到：原来挡着嘉陵江的山峡被爆破了一个长条形的河道缺口。嘉陵江汹涌的洪水就顺着这新开的河道向前奔流而去。
    这一带，嘉陵江原来绕山而流，成一个瘦长的马嘴形。铁路通过马嘴形江面需要修建两座桥梁。现在嘉陵江河道改直，原来计划在嘉陵江上修建的两座桥，就可以省掉一座。剩下的一座桥也只要跨过一个支流，桥的规模就小得多了。这样，还可使工程不受洪水期影响。
    采用大爆破法来改变河道，在我国铁路修筑史上还是第一次。这是苏联爆破专家契契金在工地观察后提出来的建议，他在爆破前曾帮助修改了大爆破施工的设计，并从宝鸡连夜赶到一百多公里外的工地指导施工。　（新华社）
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂两车间建成

    贵州遵义地区发现丰富矿藏
    贵州省遵义市附近地区，经过地质人员一年多的普查，证明是一个矿层稳定的锰矿床。目前地质人员正在进行钻探，为国家提出开采资料。在这个地区还发现了蕴藏量丰富的磷矿和硫磺矿及其它矿产。这些已经发现的矿产经科学鉴定，质量都很好。
    正在钻探的锰矿，含锰率一般都很高。经过多次化验的磷矿，证明是我国正在开采的磷矿中质量最高的一个。新发现的硫磺矿含硫成分也在百分之四十到五十左右。
    磷矿和硫磺矿的大量发现，加上附近正安县蕴藏的大量火硝矿，解决了贵州省地方国营遵义磷肥厂正在设计的过磷酸钙厂所需要的主要原料问题。

    新疆军区生产部队大量开荒
    新疆省计划今年在天山南北开垦荒地六十多万亩，建立一批国营农场。目前新疆军区生产部队正紧张进行这项开荒工作，他们已出动了一百八十四台拖拉机和二十台推土机参加开荒。在开荒中，由于拖拉机手们热烈地开展了劳动竞赛，充分发挥了机器效能，开荒工作进展很快。乌鲁木齐垦区某支队，平均每台拖拉机一小时开荒十亩。从五月中旬到六月中旬，这个支队已开垦了两万多亩荒地。今年冬季，这些新开垦的荒地将按照轮作计划种下一部分冬播作物。
    在开垦以前，新疆省荒地勘测设计局，对这片荒地按照国营农场规划的要求进行了全面的勘查设计，对于科学的灌溉、排水、林带、道路以及耕作条田的规划布置，都作了精密的设计。

    福建南部山区新建许多果园
    福建省南部山区今年有不少荒山已被农民开辟成新果园。据诏安、漳浦、南安等县统计：今年新开辟的山地果园中，共种植柑、桔、桃、李、荔枝、龙眼等十二种果树四十九万多株。这些果树的成活率在百分之九十左右。
    最近南部山区各县农业技术推广站有的开办果农训练班，有的派技术干部深入山村，帮助新果园的主人学会管理果园的方法。诏安县在山地种柑、桔已有一百多年历史的走马塘村开办了果农训练班；果农经过实地观摩，对“果树上山”的信心很大。
    现在南部山区各地不少农业生产合作社和互助组正继续开垦荒山，整理梯田，准备在秋收后再种植一批果树。国营农场已准备好五万多株果树苗给农民移植。　（新华社）
