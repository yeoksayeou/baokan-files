Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 21st: Saigon News: On the first anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on July 20th, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities created an incident in Saigon of openly opposing the Geneva Accords and destroying the International Supervisory and Control Commission of Vietnam. On this day, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities organized another "demonstration" in Saigon. According to Agence France-Presse, the "demonstrators" were transported to Saigon on the morning of that day by hundreds of trucks, most of which belonged to the Ngo Dinh Diem army. These instructed thugs broke into the two hotels where the personnel of the International Supervisory and Control Commission of Vietnam were staying—the Majestic Hotel and the Gallieni Hotel—and unscrupulously engaged in sabotage and destruction.

The thugs, armed with knives, axes, and sticks, broke into the rooms of the International Commission representatives in the Majestic Hotel, destroying and looting various items, stealing some documents and materials from the representatives, throwing furniture out of the windows, and setting fires. The Chairman of the International Commission, Indian representative Desai, was insulted by the thugs and driven out of the hotel. Polish personnel in the Commission and Vietnamese People's Army personnel working with the International Commission were also insulted. The thugs also burned two white cars of the International Commission.

The Indian representative of the International Commission has immediately protested to the Ngo Dinh Diem government, condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem government's failure to guarantee the safety of the International Commission.

The news indicates that this atrocity was planned and carried out under the organization of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. The day before the atrocity, cars equipped with loudspeakers publicly announced on the streets of Saigon that there would be a "demonstration" to "expel" the personnel of the International Commission the next day, and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities also declared the anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords—July 20th—as a "National Day of Humiliation," ordering cinemas, theaters, and dance halls to close on this day.

    吴庭艳当局竟指使暴徒
    袭击越南国际委员会
    新华社河内二十一日电　西贡消息：在七月二十日日内瓦协定签订一周年纪念日，吴庭艳当局在西贡制造了一次公开反对日内瓦协定、捣毁越南国际监督和监察委员会的暴行事件。这一天，吴庭艳当局又在西贡组织了一次“示威游行”。据法新社报道，“示威者”是在当天上午由数百辆卡车，其中大部分是属于吴庭艳军队的军车运来西贡的。这些受到指使的暴徒们冲进了越南国际监督和监察委员会人员所居住的两家旅馆——皇后旅馆和加利埃尼旅馆，肆无忌惮地进行捣乱和破坏。
    拿着小刀、斧头、棍棒的暴徒们闯进了皇后旅馆国际委员会代表所居住的各个房间，捣毁和劫掠各种东西，抢走代表们的一些文件和材料，把家俱扔出窗外，并且放起火来。国际委员会主席、印度代表德赛受到了暴徒们的侮辱，并且被他们赶出旅馆。委员会中的波兰人员和随同国际委员会工作的越南人民军人员也遭到了侮辱。暴徒们还焚烧国际委员会的两辆白色的汽车。
    国际委员会的印度代表已经立即向吴庭艳政府提出抗议，谴责吴庭艳政府不能保证国际委员会的安全。
    消息说明，这次暴行是在吴庭艳当局组织下有计划地进行的。在暴行发生前一天，装着扩音器的汽车在西贡街头公开宣布第二天将有“驱逐”国际委员会人员的“示威”，吴庭艳当局并且宣布日内瓦协定签订周年纪念日——七月二十日为“国耻日”，命令电影院、戏院、舞厅在这一天停业。
