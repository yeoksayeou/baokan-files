Firmly Grasp the Weapons in Our Hands, Defend the Socialist Construction of the Motherland

(I) To the Editors:

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" clearly depicts a beautiful picture of the motherland's construction for us. I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. I deeply realize that the motherland's First Five-Year Plan is closely related to my work. Our Chinese People's Volunteers fought against the American aggressors in Korea precisely to defend the construction of the motherland; the victory of the Chinese and Korean people in crushing American aggression in Korea has further guaranteed the smooth progress of our socialist construction. The achievements of the motherland's construction will greatly strengthen our national defense.

I know that the enemy is not reconciled to our victory, and they will still try to undermine our construction. I am determined to strengthen my studies, heighten my vigilance, work a hundred times harder, and be ready at any time to strike at any enemy who dares to provoke us, and to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage the construction of the motherland, so as to defend the motherland's great First Five-Year Plan.

(II) To the Editors:

After reading Comrade Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," I felt extremely excited. The Five-Year Plan depends on the heroic labor of all the people of our country to realize it. I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. Although I do not directly participate in economic construction, the motherland has given me the sacred task of participating in national defense construction. In the struggle to achieve the Five-Year Plan, I want to dedicate my greatest strength to excellently completing all the work tasks assigned to me by my superiors. At present, the imperialists are still occupying our territory of Taiwan, threatening us with a new war, and there are still hidden counter-revolutionary elements in the country carrying out criminal sabotage activities. I am determined to heighten my vigilance, keep my eyes open, strive to learn modern military science and technology, and firmly grasp the weapons in my hands to defend the security of the motherland's territory and to defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    紧紧握住手中武器，保卫祖国的社会主义建设
    （一）编辑同志：
    李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”清楚地给我们描绘了一幅祖国建设的美好图景。我是志愿军的一个战士。我深深地认识祖国第一个五年计划同我的工作有着密切的联系。我们志愿军在朝鲜打击美国侵略者，正是为了保卫祖国的建设；中朝人民粉碎了美国在朝鲜的侵略行为，就使我国社会主义建设事业的顺利进行得到了进一步的保证。祖国建设的成就，又将大大地增强国防力量。
    我知道，敌人对我们的胜利是不甘心的，他们还会企图来破坏我们的建设。我决心加强学习，提高警惕，百倍努力地做好工作，随时准备打击一切敢于向我们挑衅的敌人，肃清一切破坏祖国建设的反革命分子，来保卫祖国伟大的第一个五年计划。

    （二）编辑同志：
    读了李富春同志“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”以后，感到无比的兴奋。五年计划是要靠我们全国人民的英勇劳动来实现的。我是人民解放军的战士，虽然没有直接参加经济建设，但是祖国给了我参加国防建设的神圣任务。在争取五年计划完成的斗争中，我要献出自己最大的力量，出色地完成上级交给的一切工作任务。目前，帝国主义还侵占着我国的领土台湾，用新战争来威胁我们，国内也还有暗藏的反革命分子，在进行罪恶的破坏活动。我决心提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，努力学习现代化的军事科学技术，紧紧地握住手中的武器，来保卫祖国领土的安全，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
