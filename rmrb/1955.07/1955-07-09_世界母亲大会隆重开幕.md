Xinhua News Agency, Lausanne, July 8th (Reporter Lin Ning) -- The World Mothers' Congress grandly opened here at the "Coutau-Suisse" building at 10:30 AM on the 7th. Over 1,200 delegates from more than 70 countries, including India, China, Italy, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and various Latin American countries, met joyfully at the venue. They warmly embraced and inquired about the health of each other's children. The common wish of mothers to protect their children was like a strong and resilient thread, connecting all mothers closely together.

    Hanging above the presidium was a giant painting depicting a young mother holding a plump and adorable child on her shoulder, the mother's resolute expression demonstrating her determination and will to protect her child. This giant painting was also the emblem of the congress.

    Around the venue hung the national flags of the participating countries and many slogans calling on people to fight to protect children and oppose war.

    On the presidium were the heads of the delegations from various countries, women representatives from the cities that had suffered the most from the ravages of war, members of the national preparatory committees for the World Mothers' Congress, and prominent women from various countries.

    Mrs. Gordon, a famous French social activist and active fighter for peace, was elected as the chairwoman of the congress by the delegates.

    A group of lively and adorable Swiss children walked onto the stage with flowers to present them to the presidium. They threw themselves into the arms of the delegates like little birds, tightly embracing them with their small hands. The mothers on the stage kissed them, and the mothers below the stage watched them with tears in their eyes, immersed in touching and great maternal love.

    Mrs. Violette Thiland, Chairwoman of the Swiss Reception Committee, first extended a welcome on behalf of the Swiss women to the delegates attending the congress.

    Then, Mrs. Gordon gave a report entitled "We Bear Life, We Must Defend Life."

    Mrs. Gordon said: Women of different ages and races have come from different places to participate in this great women's gathering, with the aim of protecting their children from the threat of war and fighting for disarmament and friendship among the peoples of all countries.

    She added that the series of events currently taking place in Europe and Asia indicate that the situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace. However, the resources and manpower of some countries are still being used for arms expansion and war preparations, and the threat of war still exists. She said that the purpose of this congress is to unite the women who make up half of humanity more closely together, making them an invincible force against war and in defense of their children. She said: We believe that the love of great mothers can overcome the forces of evil and ultimately conquer war.

    Mrs. Gordon concluded by saying, sisters, unite, behind this great shield, life will fight, life will triumph.

    Mrs. Gordon's speech was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

    The meeting read out telegrams of congratulations or articles expressing support for the congress from Soong Ching Ling of China, Mrs. Nehru of India, Ibarruri of Spain, and the wife of the famous singer Robeson, among others.

    Representatives from France, Poland, South Africa, Italy, Japan, and North Korea, among other countries, spoke at the meeting that day.

    The delegates listened attentively to Mrs. Senon's speech. She was one of the few survivors of a French town called Oradour-sur-Glane, which was destroyed from the ground by the Hitler bandits in June 1944. She called on mothers to unite and fight against another threat of war.

    Polish Member of Parliament Musiawowa reported to the congress on the Polish women's unwavering determination to fight for peace.

    Ellen Chiviti, an Italian woman whose husband, children, and seven brothers were all sacrificed in the anti-fascist war, urged the congress to demand that governments pursue peaceful policies. She said: "Mothers of the world, we must be vigilant!"

    A moving scene at the meeting was the presentation of flags and gifts to the congress by the Italian mothers' delegation. A large delegation marched into the venue holding flags of various colors, with the names of the children of Italian mothers who were murdered by the Nazis during the war embroidered by hand on these flags. Another delegation, also composed of Italian mothers, presented dozens of photo albums with pictures of their children to the presidium, expressing their determination to fight to protect the lives and happiness of these children.

    The entire venue stood up and applauded when the Italian mothers presented their gifts.

    世界母亲大会隆重开幕
    新华社洛桑八日电　本社记者林宁报道：世界母亲大会七日上午十时半在这里的“科图阿尔·瑞士”大厦隆重开幕。来自印度、中国、意大利、法国、苏联、美国、拉丁美洲各国等七十多个国家的一千两百多名代表在会场上愉快地会面。她们热情地拥抱，互相询问孩子们的健康。母亲们保卫孩子的共同心愿像一缕坚韧的线，把所有母亲都亲密地连接起来了。
    大会主席台上悬挂着一幅巨画，一个年青的母亲肩上举着一个肥胖可爱的孩子，母亲脸上坚决的表情表现出保卫孩子的决心和意志。这幅巨画也就是这次大会的会徽。
    会场的四周挂着与会各国的国旗和许多号召人们为保卫儿童、反对战争而斗争的标语。
    在主席台上，有各国代表团团长，有曾经受战争创伤最重的城市的妇女代表，有世界母亲大会各国筹备委员会的委员，还有各国的知名妇女。
    法国著名的社会活动家、争取和平的积极战士戈登夫人被代表们选举为大会主席。
    一群活泼可爱的瑞士儿童拿着鲜花走上主席台向主席团献花。他们像小鸟一样投向代表们的怀里，用两只小手紧紧地搂抱着代表们。台上的母亲们亲吻着他们，台下的母亲们眼睛里闪着泪花疼爱地注视着他们，整个大厅沉浸在感人的伟大的母爱里。
    瑞士接待委员会主席维奥列特·泰兰丝夫人首先代表瑞士妇女向出席大会的代表们表示欢迎。
    接着戈登夫人作了“我们孕育了生命，我们要保卫生命”的报告。
    戈登夫人说：年龄不同和种族不同的妇女从不同的地方前来参加这个伟大的妇女集会，目的是要保卫自己的孩子免受战争威胁，为裁减军备和各国人民间的友好而奋斗。
    她又说，目前欧洲和亚洲一连串的事件表示着形势向有利于和平的方面发展。但是，有些国家的资源和人力仍然被用在扩军备战方面，目前仍然存在着战争威胁。她说，这次大会的目的就是要把占全人类一半的妇女更紧密地团结起来，使她们成为反对战争、保卫自己的孩子的不可战胜的力量。她说：我们相信，伟大的母亲的爱能够战胜邪恶的势力，能够最后战胜战争。
    戈登夫人最后说，姊妹们，团结起来，在这个巨大的盾牌后面，生命将战斗，生命将战胜。
    戈登夫人的演讲受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    会议上宣读了中国的宋庆龄、印度的尼赫鲁夫人、西班牙的伊巴露丽和著名歌唱家罗伯逊的夫人等致大会的贺电或者表示支持大会的文章。
    在这天会议上发言的有法国、波兰、南非、意大利、日本和朝鲜等国家的代表。
    代表们专心地倾听了赛农夫人的演说。她是在一九四四年六月被希特勒匪帮从地面上毁灭掉的一个名叫格朗河畔的奥拉多尔法国小镇上仅有的几个幸存者之一。她要求母亲们团结起来为反对另一次战争威胁而斗争。
    波兰议会议员穆霞沃娃向大会报告了波兰妇女为和平而斗争的不屈不挠的决心。
    丈夫、孩子和七个兄弟都在反法西斯战争中牺牲的意大利的爱伦·契维敦促大会要求各国政府奉行和平政策。她说：“世界上的母亲们，我们要警惕啊！”
    会议上的一个动人场面是意大利母亲代表向大会献旗和献礼。一个规模很大的代表团举着各种颜色的旗子走进会场，意大利各地的母亲把她们在战争期间被纳粹杀害的孩子们的名字亲手绣在这些旗子上。另一个也是由意大利的母亲们组成的代表团把数十本贴着孩子照片的照片簿献给了大会主席团，以表示为保卫这些孩子的生命和幸福而斗争的决心。
    意大利母亲献礼时全场起立鼓掌。
