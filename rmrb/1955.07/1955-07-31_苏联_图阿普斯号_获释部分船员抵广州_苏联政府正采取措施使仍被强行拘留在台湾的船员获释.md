Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: TASS reports: As is known, on June 23, 1954, the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse," carrying oil to the People's Republic of China, was illegally hijacked on the high seas south of Taiwan Island, in an area controlled by U.S. naval forces, and taken to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, under armed threat. The crew members of the "Tuapse" oil tanker were imprisoned in concentration camps in Taiwan.

The Soviet government has repeatedly demanded that the U.S. government release the oil tanker, its cargo, and its crew members, because the "Tuapse" oil tanker was intercepted precisely in a region controlled by its armed forces.

In September 1954, the Soviet government requested the French government to look after the fate of the "Tuapse" oil tanker's crew members and to help ensure the early release of the oil tanker and its crew members to return to the Soviet Union.

The Executive Committee of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union also made a similar request to the Swedish Red Cross.

All these efforts led to the release of twenty-nine crew members from the "Tuapse" oil tanker. On July 26, 1955, the released Soviet crew members arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Taiwan and arrived in Guangzhou on July 27.

In the next few days, the aforementioned group of crew members from the "Tuapse" oil tanker will return home.

Measures are currently being taken to ensure the release of other crew members who are still being forcibly detained in Taiwan.

    苏联“图阿普斯号”获释部分船员抵广州
    苏联政府正采取措施使仍被强行拘留在台湾的船员获释
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：大家知道，在一九五四年六月二十三日，载着石油前往中华人民共和国的苏联油船“图阿普斯号”在台湾岛以南美国海军部队控制的公海上遭到一艘军舰的非法劫夺，并且在武装威胁下被劫往台湾的高雄港。“图阿普斯号”油船上的船员被监禁在台湾的集中营里。
    苏联政府一再要求美国政府释放这艘油船、船上的货物和船员，因为“图阿普斯号”油船正是在因它的武装部队控制着的地区被截留的。
    一九五四年九月，苏联政府要求法国政府照顾“图阿普斯号”油船船员的命运和帮助使这艘油船和它的船员尽快获释回到苏联。
    苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会的执行委员会向瑞典红十字会也提出了类似的请求。
    这一切努力使“图阿普斯号”油船上的二十九个船员得到释放。在一九五五年七月二十六日，获释的苏联船员乘飞机从台湾到达香港，在七月二十七日到达广州。
    在今后几天中，上述这批“图阿普斯号”油船上的船员就将返国。
    目前正在采取措施，以便使仍然被强行拘留在台湾的其他船员也得到释放。
