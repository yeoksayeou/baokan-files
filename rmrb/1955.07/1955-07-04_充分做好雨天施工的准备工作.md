    Fully Prepare for Rainy Day Construction
    Du Shixun, Deputy Director of the Production Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering
    Now, the rainy season has already arrived in southern China; in the north, the rainy season is also approaching. Appropriately utilizing rainy days for construction is a very important matter in current construction engineering. Because construction engineering is mostly carried out in the open, it is greatly affected by the climate. According to historical meteorological data, some areas in China have more than one hundred rainy days each year, and even areas with fewer rainy days have about fifty days. If these rainy days are not utilized for construction, the total number of working days throughout the year will be reduced, and the phenomenon of occasional work stoppages and rush work will increase, resulting in losses of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Conversely, if we try to utilize rainy days as much as possible, we can overcome these shortcomings, accelerate the pace of construction, and enable a large number of basic construction projects to be put into production or utilized earlier.
    Judging from the commencement and plan execution of basic construction projects this year, it is also very necessary to promote rainy day construction. As of the end of May, the basic construction projects undertaken by the Ministry of Construction Engineering system have only completed 17.6 percent of the annual planned workload. The plan execution of certain key projects undertaken by construction enterprises in new industrial bases is even more serious. Among them, some units completed only 2.5 percent of the annual planned workload by the end of May; not only will most of the factory buildings be constructed in the third and fourth quarters, but also most of the workload will have to be completed in the months after June. This shows that the task for the second half of this year is extremely heavy and tight. Under these circumstances, making the most of rainy days and striving for more time to construct, in order to ensure the timely or early completion of the basic construction plan, is of great significance.
    In the past, many units have focused on promoting rainy day construction on different projects and have achieved some results and experience. From the situation of 115 work areas or construction sites of 42 state-owned and local state-owned construction companies that promoted rainy day construction by the Ministry of Construction Engineering last year, the better units have reached a rainy day utilization rate of 80 percent, and the scope of rainy day operations has been extended from indoor operations to outdoor operations such as bricklaying, concrete pouring, exterior wall plastering, hoisting, and pipeline installation; the poorer units have also reached a rainy day utilization rate of 33 percent. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant project undertaken by the directly affiliated engineering company encountered 44 rainy days in the three months of June, July, and August last year, but because rainy day construction was organized, the tasks for these months were still overfulfilled, and the project quality was also very good.
    However, the organization of rainy day construction is still a weak link in construction engineering, and there are still many problems in this regard.
    First of all, some leaders of construction units and construction companies lack a correct and comprehensive understanding of the importance and complexity of rainy day construction. Some only see the unfavorable conditions of rainy day construction, such as the fact that ensuring project quality and production safety is more difficult than usual, requiring additional equipment costs, the efficiency of some machinery may be slightly affected, and the cost of certain materials and semi-finished products may increase slightly; but they do not see the benefits of rainy day construction. Therefore, they have been following the old habit of "no construction on rainy days." Some units underestimate the complexity and difficulty of rainy day construction, do not carefully study the possibility of construction technology in advance, do not meticulously calculate the economic effects, and ignore the necessary preparatory work, simply relying on enthusiasm and blind hard work. As a result, the construction order is chaotic, the site is flooded, the roads are muddy, the supply and demand are out of balance, the materials are wet, deteriorated, and damaged, and accidents occur frequently.
    Another serious problem in rainy day construction is neglecting thrift and disregarding costs. Some units, regardless of the length of the rainy season and the amount of rainfall, do not carefully study the actual needs of the project, and blindly increase the purchase of rain gear and build rain shelters. Some units only roughly determine the cost indicators for rainy season construction without strict financial supervision and inspection, resulting in either exceeding the original indicators or failing to save what could have been saved. Some units neglect the maintenance and repair of machinery, the storage of materials, and the recycling of materials and tools, resulting in the loss or damage of machinery and a large number of materials and tools. Some units even use sand, bricks, roof panels, and wood to pave roads, causing intolerable serious waste.
    Another problem is that some units do not pay attention to formulating and implementing technical measures and operating procedures in rainy day construction, resulting in continuous accidents. Some serious ones have even caused major accidents such as foundation settlement, insufficient concrete strength, bulging brick walls, collapse of scaffolding, and collapse of work sheds.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of this year's rainy season construction, it is necessary to learn from the experiences and lessons of previous years and do the following work well:
    First of all, it is necessary to earnestly do a good job in construction preparation. All construction units and construction companies should check the supply of drawings, carefully analyze the construction conditions, and plan to complete the projects that are not easy to construct during the rainy season and rainy days, especially a large number of earthwork projects, underground projects, and certain roof projects, as much as possible before the rainy season or by using sunny days. This will create favorable conditions for rainy season or rainy day construction, so that various foundation projects and other projects can be successfully constructed during the rainy season. In order to ensure that rainy season construction can be carried out in an orderly manner and avoid confusion and disconnection, all units should carefully and thoroughly prepare rainy season construction plans. Based on the research and analysis of construction technical conditions and the calculation of economic effects, the plans should be correct and advanced; at the same time, attention should be paid to preparing corresponding guarantee plans for labor, materials, prefabricates, semi-finished products, and the supply of machinery and equipment, so that the rainy season construction plans are practical and feasible. All units should also adapt to the characteristics of rainy day construction, revise the construction organization technical design, prepare the construction operation design for unit projects, and strictly review technical measures and operating procedures. Based on these, repair roads and drainage systems, build necessary rain shelters, prepare rain and drainage equipment for the work surface, especially the trenches and material stacking yards, and take necessary temporary measures to properly arrange the working and living conditions of employees during rainy day construction, and do a good job in technical preparation to ensure project quality and production safety. In carrying out these tasks, it is necessary to strictly implement the principle of practicing thrift, and carefully prepare and review the rainy day construction cost budget, making full use of existing roads, drainage ditches, and existing work sheds, rain gear, pumping and drainage machinery and other equipment. Even if it is necessary to add equipment in order to adapt to the needs of rainy day construction, equipment that costs less, has a high utilization rate, and is flexible in movement (such as movable lifting rain sheds) should be used, and attention should be paid to using waste materials and bamboo, and minimizing the use of new materials and wood. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in the preparation and protection of materials, machinery, and tools. Regular supply plans should be made, the entry time and stacking locations should be planned well, and the storage volume should be appropriately specified to avoid unnecessary phenomena such as work stoppages due to material shortages, stockpiling of materials, long-distance transportation on rainy days, and increased on-site short-distance transportation. Attention should be paid to checking warehouses as early as possible; for materials and machinery placed in the open, rain and water protection should be done to prevent waste.
    Now, some construction sites in the south are satisfied with the existing preparations, but as a result, when the rainy season comes, there are many loopholes and great confusion. Therefore, it is necessary for all construction units in the north to conduct an in-depth inspection of the above-mentioned preparatory work before entering the rainy season.
    In addition to fully preparing, management work during the rainy season should also be more careful than usual. In order to ensure project quality and personal safety, it is necessary to strengthen technical leadership and quality supervision; timely inspection of concealed works should be carried out; attention should be paid to testing the water content of sand, stone, and bricks, the humidity of wood, the consistency of mortar, and the slump of concrete; scaffolding, inclined roads, temporary houses, power transmission lines, and high-altitude structures should be strictly inspected, and all unsafe facilities should be improved; the maintenance and management of transportation vehicles should be strengthened; necessary rain gear should be provided to personnel working in the rain; and technical and safety briefings should be conducted in depth. In addition, it is also necessary to establish a liaison system with meteorological forecasting departments to keep abreast of climate changes in a timely manner; pay close attention to grass-roots operation plans and scheduling work, improve labor organization accordingly, and adjust the cooperation relationship between leading types of work and auxiliary types of work in a timely and appropriate manner; strengthen the storage, distribution, and recovery system of materials, machinery, tools, and protective equipment, strictly control the consumption of materials, and measure labor efficiency and material consumption quotas in a timely manner; after the use of machinery and tools, attention should be paid to cleaning and protection. Through these measures, we can improve labor efficiency during rainy season construction, reduce the loss of materials and tools, and prevent quality rework, personal accidents, and waste.
    Promoting rainy day construction in construction engineering is a very complex and arduous task. To do this work well and implement the above-mentioned measures, first of all, it depends on the active and close cooperation between the construction units and the construction companies, and the concerted efforts to overcome difficulties. Secondly, it is necessary to conduct in-depth ideological education among employees, dispel their ideological concerns, criticize the conservative tendencies of following old habits, and prevent and oppose departmentalism and irresponsible behaviors of mutual shirking and passive waiting. It is necessary to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, organize them to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of rainy day construction, study the technology of rainy day construction, and improve the level of management. In this way, we can smoothly realize rainy day construction, overcome the seasonality and discontinuity of construction engineering, and complete the country's basic construction plan faster and more.

    充分做好雨天施工的准备工作
    建筑工程部生产局副局长  杜思训
    现在，我国的南方，已经是雨季了；在北方，雨季也即将到来。适当地利用雨天施工，是目前建筑工程施工中一件非常重要的事情。因为建筑工程的施工，多是在露天进行，受气候的影响很大。据历年气象资料记载，我国有些地区每年的雨天在一百天以上，雨少的地区也有五十天左右。如果不利用这些雨天施工，全年的工作日就会减少，时而停工闲工，时而抢工赶工的现象就会增加，从而人力、物力、财力都会受到损失。反之，如果我们尽量利用雨天施工，就可以克服这些缺点，加快建设速度，使大量基本建设工程得以提前投入生产或提前利用。
    从今年基本建设工程开工和计划执行情况来看，推行雨天施工也是非常必要的。截至五月底止，建筑工程部系统承建的基本建设工程，只完成全年计划工作量的百分之十七点六。新工业基地的建筑企业单位所承担的某些重点工程，计划执行情况更加严重。其中有的单位到五月底完成的工作量仅占全年计划工作量的百分之二点五；不但绝大部分厂房要在第三、四季度施工，而且绝大部分工作量要在六月以后的几个月里去完成。这说明今年后半年的任务是极其繁重而紧张的。在这种情况下，尽量地利用雨天，争取有更多的时间施工，来保证基本建设计划按期或提前完成，就有非常重要的意义。
    过去有不少单位已在不同工程上重点地推行了雨天施工，取得了一些成绩和经验。从去年建筑工程部推行雨天施工的四十二个国营、地方国营建筑公司的一百一十五个工区或工地的情况来看，较好的单位雨天利用率已达到百分之八十，雨天施工的作业范围也由室内作业推广到砌砖、浇灌混凝土、粉刷外墙、装吊、管道安装等室外作业的工程上去；较差的单位雨天利用率也达到了百分之三十三。直属工程公司承建的第一汽车制造厂工程在去年六、七、八三个月中遇到四十四个雨天，但因为组织了雨天施工，仍然超额完成了这几个月的任务，工程质量也很好。
    但是，现在组织雨天施工仍然是建筑工程施工中的一个薄弱环节，在这方面还有不少问题。
    首先是某些建设单位和施工单位的领导人员对雨天施工的重要性和复杂性缺乏正确的全面的认识。有的只看到雨天施工的不利条件，如保证工程质量和生产安全要比平时困难一些，需要增加一些设备费用，有些机械的效率可能稍许受些影响，某些材料和半成品的成本可能略有增加；而没有看到雨天施工的好处。因此他们一直因循着“雨天不施工”的旧习惯。有的单位对雨天施工的复杂性和困难估计不足，事先不认真研究施工技术的可能性，不精细地计算经济效果，忽视应有的准备工作，只是凭热情盲目蛮干。结果弄得施工秩序混乱，现场积水，道路泥泞，供需失调，材料淋湿，变质损坏，事故层出不穷。
    在雨天施工中另一个严重问题是忽视节约，不惜成本。有的单位不问雨期长短，雨量大小，不认真研究工程的实际需要，盲目增置防雨用具，搭盖雨棚。有的单位只粗略地确定雨季施工的费用指标，而不进行严格的财务监督和检查，结果不是超过了原定指标，就是本可节省的也没有节省。有的单位忽视维护检修机械、保管材料和回收材料、工具等工作，使得机械和大量材料、工具遗失或损坏。有的单位甚至用沙子、砖块、屋面板和木料铺垫道路造成令人不能容忍的严重浪费。
    再一个问题是有些单位在雨天施工中不注意制定和贯彻技术措施和操作规程，以致事故不断发生。个别严重的甚至造成了基础下沉，混凝土强度不够，砖墙鼓肚、和脚手架子塌落和工棚倒塌等重大事故。
    为了保证今年雨季施工得以顺利进行，必须吸取往年的经验教训，做好下列工作：
    首先要切实做好施工准备工作。各个建设单位和施工单位要检查图纸供应情况，认真分析施工条件，有计划地把雨季和雨天不易施工的工程，特别是大量的土方工程、地面以下的工程和某些屋面工程，尽一切可能在雨季前或利用晴天做好。这样就给雨季或雨天施工创造了有利条件，使得各种基础工程以及其他工程能在雨季顺利施工。为了使雨季施工能够有秩序地进行，避免发生混乱脱节现象，各个单位都要谨慎周密地编制雨季施工计划。要根据对施工技术条件的研究分析，对经济效果的计算，把计划订得正确、先进；同时又要注意编制相应的劳动、材料、预制品、半成品、机械设备的供应等保证计划，使雨季施工计划切实可行。各个单位还要适应雨天施工的特点，修订施工组织技术设计，编好单位工程的施工作业设计，严格审查技术措施和操作规程。根据这些来整修道路和排水系统，搭盖必要的雨棚，做好工作面特别是地槽和材料堆放场的防雨排水设备，采取必要的临时设施以妥善安排职工在雨天施工的工作条件和生活条件，做好保证工程质量和生产安全的技术准备工作。在进行这些工作中，要严格贯彻厉行节约的原则，要认真编制和审核雨天施工费用预算，充分利用现有的道路排水沟渠和现有的工作棚、雨具、抽水排水机械等设备。即使为了适应雨天施工需要必须增添设备时，也应采用花钱少、利用率高、移动灵活的设备（如活动升降雨棚等），并应注意利用废料、竹材，尽量少用新料、木料。此外，还必须做好材料、机械、工具的准备和防护工作。要定期做出供应计划，规划好进场时间和堆放地点，恰当地规定储备量，以避免发生停工等料、积压材料以及雨天长距离运输和增加现场小运搬等不应有的现象。要及早注意检查仓库；对露天放置的材料和机械，要做好防雨避水工作，以防止发生浪费。
    现在，南方的某些工地因为满足于已有的准备，结果雨季来临以后，漏洞百出，十分混乱。因此目前北方的各个施工单位有必要在进入雨季以前对上述各项准备工作进行一次深入的检查。
    除了充分做好准备工作之外，在雨季当中，施工的管理工作也要比平时更加注意。为了保证工程质量和人身安全，必须加强技术领导和质量监督；及时进行隐蔽工程的检验；注意试验砂、石、砖的含水量，木材的湿度，灰浆的稠度，混凝土的坍落度；要严格检查脚手架、斜道、临时房屋、输电线路和高空架设物，改善一切不安全的设施；要加强对交通工具的检修和管理；供给冒雨作业人员以必要的防雨用具；深入进行技术和安全的交底工作。此外，还要同气象预报部门建立联系制度，及时掌握气候变化情况；抓紧基层作业计划和调度工作，相应地改进劳动组织，及时地适当调整主导工种同辅助工种的配合关系；加强材料、机械、工具、保护用品的保管和领发回收制度，严格控制材料消耗量，及时测定劳动效率和材料消耗定额，机械和工具使用后要注意清洗和保护。通过这些措施，来提高雨季施工的劳动效率，降低料具的损耗，防止发生质量返工、人身事故和浪费现象。
    在建筑工程中推行雨天施工，是一件很复杂很艰巨的工作。要做好这项工作，贯彻上述各项措施，首先有赖于各个施工单位同建设单位主动地密切配合，协同一致地克服困难。其次，要在职工中深入进行思想教育，解除他们的思想顾虑，批判因循旧习惯的保守倾向，防止和反对本位主义思想及互相推诿、消极等待、不负责任的行为。要启发群众的积极性和创造性，组织他们认真学习雨天施工的先进经验，钻研雨天施工的技术，提高管理工作水平。这样，我们就可以顺利地实现雨天施工，克服建筑工程施工的季节性和断续性，更快和更多地完成国家的基本建设计划。
