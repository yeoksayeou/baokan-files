　　The Necessity of Resolutely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries from the Perspective of Eastern Zhejiang
　　National People's Congress Representative Yan Jingyao
　　During my inspection of the unified purchase and sale of grain and the work of mutual aid and cooperation in the Ningbo Special Zone of Zhejiang Province, many specific facts made me realize that the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation is by no means smooth sailing. Because the classes that have been overthrown domestically will never be reconciled to their demise, and the classes that are about to be eliminated will never be without resistance. With the continuous victories of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the class struggle is becoming more complex and acute. Now, based on my understanding of the activities of counter-revolutionary elements in eastern Zhejiang, I will explain it in three aspects.
　  I. The General Situation of Counter-Revolutionary Activities
　　After the liberation of Zhejiang Province, the Communist Party and the People's Government vigorously cooperated in suppressing bandits in rural areas and actively launched struggles against speculation in gold and silver and against theft, basically stabilizing the social order in the early days of liberation. On this basis, a large-scale movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched, and the land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were guaranteed. Through the above movements, the enemy was severely打击，进一步安定了社会秩序，巩固了人民民主专政，成绩是很大的，人民也非常满意.
　　However, Zhejiang was originally the old nest of Chiang Kai-shek and many Kuomintang secret service chiefs, and at the same time, it is a coastal province, vulnerable to the disturbances of the U.S.-Chiang alliance. Therefore, the spies and secret agents hiding in the area, those who climbed up from the coast, and those who descended from the sky, echoed and colluded with each other to carry out sabotage activities. Under such circumstances, it is wrong to think that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries can be achieved once and for all.
　　According to the cases that have been cracked in recent years, there are several large reactionary organizations in eastern Zhejiang, such as the "Jiangnan National Righteousness Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Third Column" with sixty to seventy people, of which twenty-one have appointment orders. The "Zhejiang People's Loyalty Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Third Column" has more than forty people. When the "Jiangnan Scientific Public Ownership Society" was cracked, 883 reactionary publications were seized, and there were 57 members at the time of the arrest. In addition, there are remnant counter-revolutionary organizations such as the "China Anti-Soviet Anti-Communist Loyalty National Salvation Corps," namely the "Zhejiang Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," and the "Revival Township Work Team."
　　The reactionary Taoist gate organizations in Zhejiang Province are also very large. According to statistics from Shaoxing County alone, there are more than 5,000 reactionary Taoist leaders, and there are also many Taoist followers. In 1952, reactionary Taoist leaders colluded with counter-revolutionary elements to organize a dynasty, and once carried out so-called official appointment and general selection. Now, Jiugong Taoism in various counties is still carrying out "receiving the law" activities and organizing "Buddha Recitation Societies" to develop organizations.
　　Counter-revolutionary elements attempt to usurp or subvert our people's political power. For example, the "Revival Township Work Team" had already appointed township chiefs, district chiefs, and county chiefs before the case was cracked.
　　The sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements are diverse. The most common is spreading rumors and posting reactionary slogans to disturb people's minds. During the spring harvest this year, counter-revolutionary elements posted slogans, demanding that farmers not sell spring flowers to cooperatives. When recruiting supplementary soldiers, counter-revolutionary elements threatened militiamen, saying: "You will be beheaded." In the coastal counties, signal flares are sometimes found at night continuously, and militiamen guarding the coast often capture enemies who sneak ashore.
　  II. Sabotaging the Policy of Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain
　　Counter-revolutionary elements took advantage of the fact that some farmers were not yet accustomed to the unified purchase and sale of grain, and spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Supply certificates are useless," "Yinxian, Yongkang, Dongyang and other counties have stipulated that one person can buy six taels of rice." Some families had quarrels over trivial matters, and they spread rumors that there was no food to eat. When people died of illness, they spread rumors that people were starving to death somewhere. Some spread rumors saying, "Fifty thousand troops have come to the county, and military grain is very urgent. The people should not think about having rice anymore!" Reactionary Taoist gate leaders who had fled outside wrote back, saying that a great disaster was coming, and asking everyone to sell their furniture to buy grain to tide over the difficulties. In this way, places where grain was not originally in short supply became tense.
　　Counter-revolutionary elements used rumors to create a tense atmosphere on the one hand, and used actions to sabotage the unified purchase and sale of grain on the other. The methods of sabotage are mainly two types. One is panic buying, speculative buying, and pretending to be poor and complaining. For example, Xu Qinghuai, a counter-revolutionary element in Taojiang Township, Shaoxing, retained enough food for ten months in the unified sale of grain in 1954, but he immediately shouted that there was not enough food to eat. In April 1955, he complained to the village staff on the one hand, and rushed to Shaoxing city to buy fragrant cakes and vermicelli heads on the other, deliberately eating chaff, leading his wife and children to buy food in restaurants, and spreading rumors among the masses, saying, "The government is not supplying grain anymore." This created a tense atmosphere in which some people scrambled for grain supplies.
　　Another method of sabotage is to instigate backward people to petition and riot. For example, more than forty people went to the provincial government to petition for grain. The provincial government immediately sent people to understand the situation and found that, apart from one counter-revolutionary element, the forty-odd people had all been deceived and that they had surplus grain at home. Counter-revolutionary elements took advantage of their fear of "revealing wealth" and threatened them, saying, "Whoever does not go to petition must have surplus grain, and we will go to his house to eat." Once the policy was clarified, the deceived people turned around and accused the counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes. Some counter-revolutionary elements also set fire to the houses of cadres and activists. There were as many as eighteen arson attacks in the forests of Huangshi Township, Lianglong District, Yuyao County.
　  III. Sabotaging the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
　　The enemy's focus of sabotage is the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. There are many ways they sabotage. The first is to create rumors to hinder farmers from participating in mutual aid and cooperation. Last winter, when mutual aid and cooperation were greatly developed in Shaoxing County, counter-revolutionary elements spread rumors, saying: "The Communist Party divided the land to the farmers, and now it has to be returned." A rumor was discovered in Dongpu District: "The purpose of the People's Government in running cooperatives is to trick women into the cooperatives to participate in labor and to get young men to become soldiers."
　　There are also counter-revolutionary elements who infiltrate the cooperatives to sabotage them. For example, when the Limin Cooperative of Sili Village, Tianhu Township, Zhenhai County, was established last year, Qian Xinfu, the squad leader of Chiang Kai-shek's "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Suppression Brigade," pretended to be active and infiltrated the cooperative. In the cooperative, he embezzled cooperative funds, induced members to gamble, and sowed discord. In late April of this year, he pulled fourteen members to withdraw from the cooperative together. After withdrawing from the cooperative, some farmers had no cattle, and they had difficulties in watering and plowing the fields. When they went to him to discuss organizing mutual aid teams to solve the problem, he said, "You voluntarily withdrew from the cooperative. You have to find a way to solve the difficulties yourself." He also said, "I intend to sabotage it and bring this cooperative down." At this time, everyone realized that they had been tricked, so the farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperative asked to return to the cooperative one after another.
　　In addition, counter-revolutionary elements also used other means of sabotage. For example, on April 21 this year, the cowshed of the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Sanli Village, Tingshan Township, Shaoxing County, was burned down by bad elements, and four cattle were burned to death or injured. In Yueguang Cooperative, Shidu Township, a cattle was crippled by counter-revolutionary elements inserting a sharpened bamboo pole into its mouth. This spring, 32 cases of arson attacks on cowsheds have been discovered in Ningbo Special Zone. Some were about to begin spring plowing the next day, but the cattle were burned to death or injured that night, and rescue was not possible, which affected the spring plowing.
　　The enemy's crazy sabotage has aroused the hatred of the vast number of farmers. Therefore, farmers in various places unanimously demand to strengthen the struggle against the enemy and demand that all hidden counter-revolutionary elements be tracked down and severely punished according to the law. Many farmers believe that the government has not handled counter-revolutionary cases in a timely or severely enough in some places, and they feel that it is too lenient. Now, all counties in eastern Zhejiang have accepted the people's opinions and strengthened the struggle against hidden enemies. For example, Yanpu Township in Cixi County has established a 32-member township security committee, and each village has a security team to handle local security with the people. When each movement begins in Zhongai Township, Sheng County, landlords, counter-revolutionary elements, etc. are educated in batches, and their control is strengthened, so that they cannot carry out sabotage activities. Other places have also taken some measures.
　　The realization of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation is a more profound and extensive revolution than the new democratic revolution, and it contains extremely complex and acute struggles. The more we love the socialist cause, the more we must be vigilant, oppose paralysis, and resolutely struggle against counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist cause.

### 从浙东的情况来看坚决镇压反革命的必要

　　从浙东的情况来看坚决镇压反革命的必要
　　全国人民代表大会代表　严景耀
    我在浙江省宁波专区视察统购统销和互助合作工作的时候，有许多具体事实，使我体会到伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，决不是风平浪静的。因为国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗的。随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的不断胜利，阶级斗争也更趋复杂和尖锐。现在据我所了解的浙东反革命分子活动情形，分三方面来说明。
　  一、反革命分子活动的一般情况
    浙江省解放以后，共产党和人民政府大力配合农村剿匪，积极开展了反金银投机，反盗窃斗争，基本上安定了解放初期的社会秩序。在这一基础上，开展了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，并保障了土地改革、抗美援朝、“三反”、“五反”等运动。通过以上各项运动，严厉打击了敌人，进一步安定了社会秩序，巩固了人民民主专政，成绩是很大的，人民也非常满意。
    但是浙江本是蒋匪和许多国民党的特务头子的老巢，同时是一个沿海的省份，易受美蒋的扰乱。因此，在本地隐蔽着的，同海边爬上来、天空降下来的间谍、特务，彼此互相呼应，互相勾结，来进行破坏活动。在这种情形之下，以为镇压反革命可以一劳永逸，是错误的。
    根据几年来已经破获的案件，浙东有几个较大的反动组织，如“江南国民仁义反共救国军第三纵队”有六、七十人，其中有二十一人有派令。“浙江人民忠义反共救国军第三纵队”有四十多人。“江南科学公有社”破获时缴获反动刊物八百八十三本，破案时有五十七名成员。此外，还有“中国抗苏反共忠义救国团”即“浙江省反共救国团”、“复兴乡区工作队”等残余反革命组织。
    浙江省反动道会门组织也很庞大。根据绍兴县一县的材料统计，有反动道首五千多名，道徒也很多，一九五二年反动道首勾结反革命分子组织王朝，曾经进行所谓封官点将。现在各县还有九宫道进行“领法”活动，组织“念佛社”来发展组织。
    反革命分子企图篡夺或颠覆我人民政权。如“复兴乡区工作队”在破案前已委派好乡长、区长、县长。
    反革命分子的破坏活动是多种多样的。最普遍的是散布谣言，贴反动标语，以扰乱人心。今年春季收割的时候，反革命分子张贴标语，要农民春花不卖给合作社。在征集补充兵员时，反革命分子威胁民兵说：“要杀头”。在沿海的各县，晚上有时连续发现打讯号弹，守海防的民兵，时常捕捉到偷上海岸来的敌人。
　  二、破坏粮食统购统销政策
    反革命分子趁着一部分农民对统购统销还不习惯，就四处散布谣言说“供应证没有用了”，“鄞县、永康、东阳等县已规定一个人买六两米”。有些家庭因小事发生口角，他们就造谣说是没有饭吃。生病死了人，就造谣某地饿死人。有的造谣说
  “县里来了五十万军队，军粮非常紧急，老百姓别再想有米吃了！”逃在外面的反动道会门头子写信回来说，大难快到，请大家卖了家具买粮食来度过难关。这样，本来粮食不紧张的地方也就紧张起来。
    反革命分子一面用谣言来造成紧张空气，一面就用行动来破坏统购统销。破坏的方法主要是两种。一种是抢购、套购、装穷叫苦。例如绍兴桃江乡反革命分子徐清槐在一九五四年粮食统销中，留足口粮十个月，但他立刻叫喊粮食不够吃。一九五五年四月他一面向村工作人员叫苦，一面到绍兴城里抢购香糕、粉丝头，故意吃糠，领着老婆孩子到饭店买饭吃，并在群众中散布谣言说：“政府粮食不供应了。”造成部分群众争求供应粮食的紧张空气。
    另一种破坏方法是煽动落后群众请愿骚动。例如有四十余人到省府请愿要粮食，省府立刻派人了解情况，发现四十余人除了一个反革命分子外，都是被骗来的，而且家里有余粮。反革命分子利用他们怕“露富”的心理，就对他们威胁说：“谁不去请愿，谁就一定有余粮，我们就到他家去吃。”政策一弄明白，被骗的群众就转过来控诉反革命分子的罪恶了。有的反革命分子还放火烧干部和积极分子的房子。余姚县梁弄区黄石乡森林纵火有十八次之多。
  　三、破坏互助合作运动
    敌人破坏的重点是以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。他们破坏的方法很多，首先是制造谣言，阻碍农民参加互助合作。去冬绍兴县互助合作大发展时，反革命分子造谣说：“共产党分土地给农民，今天要还了。”东浦区发现谣传：“人民政府办合作社的目的是为了把妇女骗到社里去参加劳动，把青年男人弄去当兵。”
    也有反革命分子混进社来破坏的。例如镇海县田胡乡四村利民社去年成立时，有蒋匪“反共救国军戡乱大队”的班长钱信甫假装积极，混入了社。在社里一面贪污社款，引诱社员赌博，一面挑拨离间，拉了十四个社员在今年四月下旬共同退社。退社以后，有的农民没有牛，车水耙田发生了困难，和他去商量组织互助组来解决，他说：“退社你自己愿意，有困难得自己想办法。”还说：“我存心破坏，要把这个社搞坍。”这时大家才知道自己上了当，于是退社农民又纷纷要求回社了。
    此外，反革命分子还用了其他破坏手段。如绍兴县亭山乡三村第六农业社，今年四月二十一日被坏分子纵火烧毁牛棚，烧死烧伤耕牛四只。石渎乡越光社的一只耕牛被反革命分子用削尖的竹竿从嘴里插进去，成了残废。今年春季宁波专区已发现纵火烧牛厩事件三十二起。有的明日就要春耕，当夜耕牛被烧死烧伤，抢救不及，影响了春耕。
    敌人的疯狂破坏，引起了广大农民的痛恨，因此各地农民一致要求加强对敌斗争，要求把一切暗藏的反革命分子追查出来，依法予以严厉制裁。许多农民认为政府在有的地方对待反革命分子案件处理得不够及时或不够严厉，觉得太宽大了。现在浙东各县已经接受人民的意见，对暗藏的敌人加强斗争。例如慈溪县淹浦乡已成立了三十二人的乡治安委员会，各村都有治安小组，同人民在一起办理当地治安。嵊县中爱乡当乡里每一运动开始时，对地主、反革命分子等分批进行教育，加强管制，使他们不能进行破坏活动。其他各地也已采取了一些措施。
    实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，这是一个比新民主主义革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。我们愈是热爱社会主义事业，就愈要提高警惕，反对麻痹，坚决同反革命分子斗争，来保证社会主义事业顺利前进。
