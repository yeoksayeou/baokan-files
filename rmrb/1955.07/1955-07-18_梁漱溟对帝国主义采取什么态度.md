Liang Shuming's Attitude Towards Imperialism

Xu Zongmian

In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the feudal landlord class was the loyal running dog of imperialist rule and enslavement of the Chinese people. Colluding with, relying on, and being loyal to imperialism was a characteristic of the old Chinese feudal landlord class. This characteristic is significantly manifested in the thoughts and certain actions of Liang Shuming, a representative figure of the landlord class. Therefore, in order to recognize the complete reactionary essence of Liang Shuming's political thought, it is necessary to expose and criticize Liang Shuming's words and deeds on the issue of imperialism.

I

People often think that Liang Shuming is a national essence advocate, a revivalist who promotes Chinese feudal culture. Thus, they fail to see that Liang Shuming's worldview, view of history, and even his views and specific proposals on Chinese political issues are closely related to imperialism and serve imperialism.

When describing the origins of his thought, Liang Shuming said: "Chinese Confucianism, Western vitalist philosophy, and medicine are the foundations of my thought" ("Morning Talks," p. 137). His so-called "Western vitalist philosophy" refers to Bergsonism, one of the most reactionary modern bourgeois philosophical schools. Liang Shuming once said: "The fundamental concepts in my thought are 'life' and 'nature.' I see the universe as alive, and everything is based on nature." "Life" is "the continuous succession of life. 'Living' means 'creative upward striving.'" "The universe...does not have another entity" but "is a great life. From the history of biological evolution to the history of human social evolution, it is a continuous line, the endless creativity of this great life." "The only thing that can represent the vigorous creative force of this great life and constantly innovate upward is humanity." (Ibid., pp. 135, 84-87) This means that the objective material world is the so-called "creation of life," the expression of human "subjective" activity. This idealist worldview is a replica of the extremely reactionary and corrupt Bergson philosophy.

If Liang Shuming sought help from the imperialist philosopher Bergson in his worldview, then he mainly appealed to another imperialist scholar, Russell, in his view of history. Liang Shuming believes that culture, including politics and economy, is the determining factor in social development, and that maintaining and promoting "inherent Chinese culture," that is, Chinese feudalist culture, is the fundamental way to solve China's problems. This reactionary idealist theory is in line with Russell's thought. What Russell tried his best to praise and save was China's backward, dying feudalist culture. Liang Shuming quoted extensively and repeatedly from Russell's various reactionary remarks in his book "The Problem of China," which distorted and vilified the Chinese nation, Chinese history, and Chinese culture, and praised them highly. Phrases such as "Western high-minded scholars," "cherishing the spirit of Chinese culture," "truly the most affectionate and insightful words, worthy of tears," and "Wise is Russell! Great is Russell!" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement," hereinafter referred to as "Awakening," pp. 110-112) are abundant in Liang Shuming's works.

Since Liang Shuming has formed such an inextricable bond with imperialism deep in his thought, it is not difficult for us to understand that although Liang Shuming tries his best to praise and flaunt "inherent Chinese culture" and the "uniqueness" of Chinese social development, he arrives at absurd conclusions on Chinese culture and Chinese national issues that are completely consistent with the imperialist viewpoint. Here, we will only take the issue of Chinese national character as an example.

Liang Shuming believes that the characteristics of a nation "are shaped by national culture." Then, what are the characteristics of the Chinese nation "shaped" by the so-called "inherent Chinese culture"? He said that the characteristics of the Chinese national character are: 1. "Selfishness and self-interest"; 2. "Diligence and thrift," including "being good at saving to the point of being stingy, with an extremely pragmatic and utilitarian spirit"; 3. "Love of politeness," which "refers to red tape, hypocrisy, emphasis on form, love of face to the point of deception," etc.; 4. "Peaceful and weak"; 5. "Contentment and self-satisfaction"; 6. "Conservatism"; 7. "Carelessness"; 8. "Perseverance and cruelty"; 9. "Tenacity and elasticity," that is, "slow simmering soup," "taffy"; 10. "Sophistication and experience." These so-called characteristics of Chinese national character are completely the hackneyed phrases used by imperialism to curse and insult the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. Liang Shuming admitted that these ten so-called characteristics of Chinese national character are "a synthesis of the views of all parties," and these "parties" not only include the works of some imperialist scholars but also the "Study of the Psychology of the Chinese" compiled and printed by the Japanese invaders. This reactionary pamphlet was supplied to the Japanese imperialist invading forces to encourage them to conquer China. (The above quotations are all from "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," pp. 24-26) This is how Liang Shuming unscrupulously helped imperialism to trample on the Chinese nation and the Chinese people ideologically.

From the above brief description, we can see that the feudal landlord class in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China had become so reactionary and degenerate that, in fundamental ideological issues such as worldview and view of history, and even in promoting feudalist culture, they could not but rely greatly on the support of imperialist corrupt thought and become loyal disseminators of various reactionary and decadent ideas of imperialism.

II

This reactionary essence of relying on and serving imperialism is expressed even more strongly and blatantly in Liang Shuming's views on modern Chinese political issues.

Due to imperialist aggression, modern China was reduced from a feudal society to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and China's social development was severely hindered. All patriotic Chinese people hated and opposed imperialist aggression. But Liang Shuming believed that "this is really a very fortunate thing, I want to thank God," because imperialist "competition and pressure on China have prevented the rise of Chinese industry and commerce, thus sparing China from becoming capitalist" ("Theory of Rural Construction," hereinafter referred to as "Theory," p. 378). Liang Shuming's welcome to imperialism was not accidental. Liang Shuming lived in the era of socialist revolution. In the world, the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the increasingly high tide of the communist movement in various capitalist countries, and in China, the widespread dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and the rapid development of the people's revolutionary forces led by the Chinese Communist Party. Facing these situations, Liang Shuming, as a representative of the feudal landlord class, felt great fear. He welcomed imperialist aggression under the pretext of opposing capitalism, but in reality, it was to oppose the realization of socialist revolution in China. He said that due to imperialist oppression, "for eighty years, it was very easy to embark on the road of industrial capital, but fortunately we were spared... In this way, we have the opportunity to talk about rural construction today. Otherwise, like Russia, forming a half-baked industrial country would be most suitable for the outbreak of communist revolution; then, we would not be able to talk about rural construction today, but would have to talk about communism!" (Ibid.) It is precisely on the fundamental issue of hindering China's social development and opposing the Chinese people from moving towards socialism and communism to achieve complete liberation that the feudal forces and imperialism discovered their common interests and common destiny, and thus closely joined hands. Liang Shuming was fully aware of the point that the feudal forces must rely on imperialism to exist. He said: "We have been deeply and long subjected to his (referring to imperialism) aggression. On the one hand, we suffer greater losses, and on the other hand, we become more dependent on him." "Therefore, if he suddenly withdraws his economic aggression, we will panic and be unable to support ourselves; instead, we will beg him, 'Please continue to aggress against me!'" ("Awakening," p. 184) These words vividly depict the ugly state of the feudal landlord class relying on imperialism.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people resolutely launched a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism. This struggle reached its first peak in 1927. The revolution of 1927 made Liang Shuming feel extremely alarmed and fearful. In order to oppose the Chinese people's revolution, he wrote the book "The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement" in 1929-1931. In this reactionary work, Liang Shuming denied imperialist aggression, openly defended imperialist aggression against China, intimidated the revolutionary people who resolutely opposed imperialism, and vilified and opposed the Chinese people's revolution, especially the Chinese Communist Party. The reactionary political ideas spread by Liang Shuming in this book have run through some of his subsequent actions and many works, especially the book "Theory of Rural Construction." These reactionary remarks of Liang Shuming are completely consistent with those of Hu Shi, the comprador lackey. Originally, in terms of serving imperialism, the feudal landlord class was no less than the comprador bourgeoisie.

Although Liang Shuming also used words like "imperialist oppression" in words, he actually fundamentally denied imperialist aggression and always defended imperialist aggression against China, and slandered the Chinese people's revolutionary propositions against imperialism. He kept saying, "Imperialists are not the real object of revolution" ("Awakening," p. 185), "I...oppose the popular saying of taking imperialism as the object of revolution" ("Reply to the Critique of Rural Construction," p. 58), "I have never agreed with the popular saying of blaming imperialism" ("Establish Credit and Strive for Cooperation"). He believed that the relationship between old China and imperialism was a "relationship between nations," so there was only "diplomacy to talk about," but "no revolution to speak of" ("Awakening," p. 185). He even nonsense that the Chinese problem "is definitely not solved by eliminating outside persecution" (ibid., p. 182). Even on the eve of the "July 7th" Incident, he openly said: "China should not think about how to destroy the enemy, but should think about how to make it difficult for the enemy to destroy us, and even how to recover easily after we are destroyed" ("Theory," p. 441). This is how Liang Shuming disregarded the facts and helped imperialism to deceive the Chinese people, asking the Chinese people not to resist it, but to compromise and surrender to it.

Liang Shuming also made shameless threats to the Chinese revolutionary people who insisted on fighting against imperialism. He said: "We cannot resist the imperialists with force, or with economic non-cooperation; the strength of each other is too far apart, and it is impossible to compare" ("Awakening," p. 185). This shameless argument of Liang Shuming is precisely the feudal landlord class's heartfelt fear and timidity towards imperialism. When the iron heels of the Japanese imperialist invaders penetrated deep into the country in 1940, and the whole nation had risen up to resist the war, he publicly declared: "'Down with imperialism' can only be used as a slogan to advocate, but in fact, we cannot attack the imperialists with force," "Armed resistance is not only unwise, but also incorrect and impossible. Even resisting him with economic non-cooperation is difficult to achieve" ("Reply to the Critique of Rural Construction," pp. 27, 58). He also said that anti-imperialism "is just talking about it, and in practice, you have to take a curve. If you go straight and be strong to the end, you will inevitably be eliminated" (ibid., p. 28). From here, we cannot distinguish at all what difference there is between Liang Shuming and the traitorous group of Chiang Kai-shek, who adopted a policy of compromise and surrender to the Japanese invaders and sang the praises of "saving the country by a curve."

The Chinese revolutionary people armed with Marxism-Leninism are not afraid of any threats. In order to help imperialism oppose the Chinese people's revolution, Liang Shuming further viciously vilified the Chinese people. He said: "Because the bullying and aggression he (referring to imperialism) imposes on me is still accountable, and the confusion and disturbance that I cause to myself is really countless. The fruit we eat today can be said to be what we have made ourselves rather than what the Europeans and Japanese have imposed on me" ("Awakening," pp. 88, 89). That is to say, the problem in China is not because of imperialist aggression, but because the Chinese themselves created it, all because the Chinese themselves are not good. Later, he said more bluntly: "International aggression and oppression cannot be blamed on others, but are actually caused by one's own inability to cope with the environment" ("Theory," p. 9).

Liang Shuming wholeheartedly supported the conspiracies of American imperialism in China after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. Not only did he slavishly praise the various criminal activities of Marshall, who was sent to China by American imperialism at that time, but even in 1949, he publicly said: "Marshall's request for peace in China was extremely sincere, and I was deeply moved by it." "The outside world thinks that Marshall and Chiang (Kai-shek) joined forces to oppress the CCP, but this is not entirely true." "Marshall is not very bad, but on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, a declaration in Yan'an scolded the United States. - Of course, Marshall is included. I always thought it was too much" ("One of the Things I Felt Guilty About in the Past Negotiations"). The "declaration in Yan'an" that Liang Shuming mentioned here is the declaration of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1946 to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident. This declaration pointed out that "the American reactionaries are also cooperating with the Chinese reactionaries, attempting to replace Japan's position and turn China into a colony of American imperialism," pointing out that all American activities in China at that time "are actually helping the dictatorship and civil war of our country's reactionaries." Because this glorious document of great historical significance thoroughly exposed the face of the American imperialists in front of the people of China and the world, it made Liang Shuming uncomfortable for at least four years.

The victory of the People's Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party was the complete destruction of the rule of imperialism and feudal forces in China. Therefore, in order to consolidate imperialist rule over China and preserve the lives of the feudal landlord class, Liang Shuming has always pointed his counter-revolutionary sword at the Chinese Communist Party for decades. In the political life of modern China, whoever opposes the Communist Party inevitably helps imperialism oppress the Chinese people. Liang Shuming's consistent and resolute slander and opposition to the Chinese Communist Party was determined by his landlord class position, and it also manifested his reactionary essence of representing the interests of imperialism and serving the imperialist masters.

III

The purpose of Liang Shuming's so-called "Rural Construction Movement," which he implemented in Zouping, Shandong, and other places from 1933 to 1937, was to consolidate the rule of imperialism and feudal forces over the Chinese people.

According to Liang Shuming, the poverty and backwardness of rural China has nothing to do with imperialist aggression. He said: "The external forces' destruction of the countryside is still limited, and our automatic destruction of the countryside in response to external stimuli is more than ten times as much" ("Theory," p. 7). The so-called "automatic destruction of the countryside," Liang Shuming means the revolutionary movements of the Chinese people in the past century, especially the revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. He said: "In the past century, ... the Chinese people's actions, all reforms, revolutions, and national self-salvation, are nothing more than destroying the countryside," and "the Communist Party is even more irrelevant, and its destructive work is entirely used in the countryside" (ibid., pp. 6-7). It should be pointed out that Liang Shuming's absurd argument is precisely a reflection of objective reality in the eyes of the landlord class. Because in the eyes of the landlord class, although imperialist aggression has affected their "beautiful" feudal rule in the countryside, it has not destroyed this order. It is the revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party that has truly destroyed the feudal rule order in rural China.

Therefore, Liang Shuming's "Rural Construction Movement" was very clearly aimed at opposing the Communist Party. He said: "Indeed, the Communist Party's killing and arson are almost the same as bandits; but in fact, this problem is not so simple... From a certain point of view, the Communist Party's actions are actually a kind of peasant movement in China... If you want to eliminate the Communist Party's peasant movement, you must have another kind of peasant movement to replace it. In addition to resisting the Communist Party from the local defense, our rural organization also has the aspect that our movement is the right track of the Chinese peasant movement and can replace the Communist Party." (ibid., pp. 279-280) What and how to "replace the Communist Party" and "eliminate the Communist Party's peasant movement"? According to him, it is to implement the "Rural Construction Movement" to "construct a new social organizational structure; - that is, to build new etiquette and customs," and the so-called "new etiquette and customs" "is the concrete fact that the inherent Chinese spirit and the strengths of Western culture are communicated and harmonized." (ibid., pp. 141, 143) Here, the so-called "inherent Chinese spirit" is the Chinese feudalist etiquette and system, and the so-called "strengths of Western culture" is the relatively strict political system and ruling order of capitalist countries (that is, the "group life of Westerners" that Liang Shuming often praised). Therefore, Liang Shuming's so-called construction of "new etiquette and customs" is to use the methods of some capitalist and imperialist countries to rule the people to maintain and consolidate the Chinese semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule.

Someone who touted Liang Shuming's "Rural Construction Movement" said, "(Liang Shuming and others) pay the most attention to borrowing from rural leaders. Probably those who are more knowledgeable, have more property, have more prestige, and have a bit of a position in a township, they all visit, must make him understand, get his sympathy, and ask him for help. The former directors of the township agricultural school, the current 'heads' of township and village schools, and the township and village directors are all filled by this group of people" (Kong Xuexiong, ed., "Rural Movement in China Today," p. 19). The so-called township agricultural schools, township schools, and village schools here are the central organizations of Liang Shuming's "Rural Construction Movement." Liang Shuming himself also said: "Our township agricultural schools can only succeed with the promotion of rural leaders." "The board of directors are all leading figures, and a principal is selected from the board of directors." ("Theory," p. 216) May I ask, in the old Chinese countryside, who are the "leading figures" who are "knowledgeable," "have property," and "have prestige" other than the landlord class elements who ride on the peasants' heads and suck their blood? The township agricultural schools and other organizations that are established by relying on the "understanding," "sympathy," and "promotion" of these "leading figures" and are controlled by them are nothing more than tools for the landlord class to rule the peasants, can they be anything else?

The things that township agricultural schools and other organizations do can be summarized into the following aspects.

First, it is to strengthen the privileges of the landlord class, instill feudal education into the peasants, and implement the so-called "spiritual tempering." The township agricultural school has a series of regulations such as "Student's Guide, Director's Guide, Head's Guide, Teacher's Guide, and Counselor's Guide." From these regulations, we can see that the landlord class is in a privileged position of rule. For example, the township chief (that is, the principal, the head) "stands in the highest position, and for the people of a township, he is in a position to supervise and teach," he "supercedes above the crowd," "to supervise the crowd and reconcile the crowd." And the peasants must "respect the head" and "accept the head's instruction." "Directors" and "directors" are all decided by the township chief, and if the peasants are dissatisfied with the "directors" and "directors," these landlord elements, they must "avoid direct conflict," only "give a word of friendship," and "it is best to talk to the head first, and let the head tell him." As for the head who "is in a transcendent position" (the above quotations are all from "Theory," pp. 235-243), that is even more something that the peasants cannot oppose. Peasants often have to listen to the "spiritual speeches" instilling "old Chinese principles," that is, Chinese feudalist etiquette, and the Kuomintang "Party Doctrine" in township agricultural schools ("Measures and Significance of Township Agricultural Schools"). This is how Liang Shuming meticulously and meticulously consolidates the feudal ruling order in the countryside, wanting the peasants to be obedient and docile slaves of the landlord class.

Second, it is to establish and train the landlord class's armed forces to suppress peasant movements. Liang Shuming himself confessed: "Now the government is promoting rural self-defense... For example, in Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces where the Communist Party is the most rampant, it is not enough to rely solely on the army to suppress them... Peasants (should be the landlord class) must rise up to defend against the Communist bandits themselves" ("General Outline of Rural Construction," pp. 40-41). This landlord class's armed forces "are summoned quickly in case of trouble, and can immediately become an army. It is called a strong reserve, but it is actually a standing militia" ("Overview of the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute and the Zouping Experimental Zone"). That is to say, when necessary, it can also be used as a source of troops for the reactionary government.

In addition, there is the so-called "economic construction" work in the countryside, that is, organizing so-called marketing and credit "cooperatives" and promoting agricultural technology improvements such as the promotion of American cotton seeds. Since, as analyzed above, everything is manipulated by the landlord class, the peasants are subjected to extremely strict feudal rule, and the feudal relations of production in the countryside have not only not changed, but have been greatly consolidated, then the so-called "cooperatives" and agricultural technology improvements must be based on the interests of the landlords and rich peasants, do they still need to be proved? What needs to be pointed out here is that if strengthening feudal rule in the countryside is Liang Shuming's way of helping imperialism consolidate its rule in China, especially in rural China, then his so-called rural economic construction is to directly expand the market for imperialism in rural China and strengthen its exploitation of Chinese peasants.

Liang Shuming organized the so-called "cooperatives" and carried out agricultural technology improvements, supposedly to "restore agricultural productivity" and make the "general purchasing power of the countryside thereby increase," so that "industry can rise due to the stimulation of needs." "Industry is triggered by agriculture, and agriculture is promoted by industry, agriculture and industry are superimposed and promoted, and the industry will progress without limit" ("Theory," pp. 388-389). Obviously, this is completely self-deceiving nonsense.

As everyone knows, in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, all economic lifelines are controlled by imperialism. Without changing this situation, it is a fundamentally impossible dream to develop national industry, realize industrialization, and improve rural productivity. The exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialism has increased unabated. During the period of 1930-1933, various imperialist countries in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis were eager to expand their commodity, raw material, and capital markets to colonial and backward countries. China, especially rural China, with its large population, was especially noticed by them. On the one hand, imperialism hoped to increase the purchasing power of rural China in order to dump more of their industrial products; on the other hand, it demanded that rural China be able to supply them with cheaper raw materials that were more suitable for their industrial production needs. This is also the real reason why the League of Nations, which represented the interests of imperialism at the time, was particularly enthusiastic about "revitalizing rural China."

Liang Shuming's so-called "transferring funds from outside cities to the inland countryside to make finance lively circulate in the poor countryside," "introducing science and technology into the inland countryside," and "increasing the export of agricultural raw materials" (ibid., pp. 302, 386, 301) and other so-called "economic construction" work precisely reflected the above-mentioned demands of imperialism at that time. His so-called "restoring agricultural productivity" and "increasing" "rural purchasing power" are not only beneficial to the landlord class, but also to expand the commodity and raw material market for imperialism, and help imperialism further exploit and exploit Chinese peasants. Liang Shuming's set of so-called rural "economic construction" work is the concrete realization of the imperialist argument of "agricultural China, industrial Japan" and other arguments that make China a colony. Some progressive economists in China at that time correctly pointed this out (see "Critique of Rural Construction in China" published in 1936).

It can be seen from this that Liang Shuming's "Rural Construction Movement" is a set of reactionary measures to consolidate the Chinese semi-colonial and semi-feudal ruling order and directly serve imperialism. It is completely consistent with the feudal comprador fascist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang - just as he himself said, "We and the government (that is, the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek) are in a relationship of mutual coexistence, not incompatibility" ("Theory" Appendix, p. 8). - The only difference is that Liang Shuming pays more attention to using "soft skills" from "below" to ideologically numb and rule the people. Therefore, Liang Shuming's "Rural Construction Movement" and other "rural movements" similar to it have not only received the help of the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek, but also the support of imperialism. These "rural work financial sources are nothing more than two sources: one is from the government; the other is from foreign countries" (ibid., p. 9). What is the financial source "from foreign countries"? It turns out that it is the "donation" of "American kerosene king" in order to "promote rural construction" and wanting to "help rural movement groups" ("General Outline of Rural Construction," pp. 36-37). - These are all Liang Shuming's own confessions.

Based on the above, we can clearly see that in order to rule and enslave the Chinese people and to oppose the people's revolution, domestic feudal forces are closely combined with imperialism, and their interests are completely consistent. This consistency is very clearly expressed in Liang Shuming's words and deeds over the years.

    梁漱溟对帝国主义采取什么态度
    徐宗勉
    在半殖民地半封建的中国，封建地主阶级是帝国主义统治和奴役中国人民的忠实走狗。勾结、依赖和效忠于帝国主义，这是旧中国封建地主阶级的一个特点。这个特点在地主阶级的代表人物梁漱溟的思想和某些行动中表现得极为显著。因此，为了认识梁漱溟的政治思想的全部反动实质，有必要揭露和批判梁漱溟在对待帝国主义问题上的言行。
    一
    人们常以为梁漱溟是个国粹主义者，是推崇中国封建文化的复古主义者，于是就没有看到梁漱溟的世界观、历史观，以至于对中国政治问题的观点和具体主张，其实都同帝国主义有密切的联系，都是为帝国主义服务的。
    梁漱溟在叙述他的思想的渊源时说：“中国儒家、西洋生命派哲学和医学三者，是我思想所从来之根柢”（“朝话”，页一三七）。他所谓“西洋生命派哲学”就是指最反动的现代资产阶级哲学派别之一——柏格森主义。梁漱溟曾说：“在我思想中的根本观念是‘生命’‘自然’，看宇宙是活的，一切以自然为宗”，而“生命”“就是活的相续。‘活’就是‘向上创造’”。“宇宙……并非另有本体”，而“是一个大生命。从生物的进化史，一直到人类社会的进化史，一脉下来，都是这个大生命无尽无已的创造”，“其能代表这大生命活泼创造之势，而不断向上翻新者，现在唯有人类”。（同上，页一三五、八四—八七）这就是说，客观物质世界是所谓“生命的创造”，是人的“主观”活动的表现。这种唯心主义的世界观正是极反动极腐败的柏格森哲学思想的翻版。
    如果说，梁漱溟在其世界观上是求救于帝国主义哲学家柏格森，那末在其历史观上就是主要乞援于另一帝国主义学者罗素。梁漱溟认为，文化包括政治、经济，它是社会发展的决定因素，而保持和宣扬“中国固有文化”即中国封建主义文化是解决中国问题的根本途径。这种反动唯心的理论是同罗素的思想一脉相通的。罗素所竭力赞扬和企图挽救的就是中国的落后、垂死的封建主义文化。罗素在其“中国之问题”一书中歪曲和污蔑中国民族、中国历史和中国文化的各种反动言论，梁漱溟都加以大量地反复地引用，并称颂备至。什么“西洋高明之士”，什么“宝爱中国文化上之精神”，什么“实为最有深情与高识之言，细味之，可为堕涕”，什么“贤矣，罗素！伟矣，罗素！”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”，以下简称“觉悟”，页一一○——一一二）等等这类无耻的赞词在梁漱溟的著作中比比皆是。
    既然梁漱溟在其思想的深处同帝国主义结下了这种不解之缘，因此我们就不难懂得，尽管梁漱溟竭力赞美和标榜“中国固有文化”、中国社会发展的“特殊性”，但他在中国文化和中国民族问题上却得出和帝国主义观点完全一致的荒谬结论。这里，我们只举中国民族性问题为例。
    梁漱溟认为，民族的特性“是由民族文化陶铸而成”。那末所谓“中国固有文化”所“陶铸而成”的中国民族特性究竟是什么呢？他说，中国民族性的特点是：一、“自私自利”；二、“勤俭”，包括“好节省以至于吝啬、极有实利主义实用主义之精神”；三、“爱讲礼貌”，这是“指繁文缛节、虚情客套、重形式、爱面子以至于欺伪”等等；四、“和平文弱”；五、“知足自得”；六、“守旧”；七、“马虎”；八、“坚忍及残忍”；九、“韧性及弹性”，即“温炖汤”、“牛皮糖”；十、“圆熟老到”。这所谓中国民族性的特点完全是帝国主义咒骂和侮辱中国民族和中国人民的滥调。梁漱溟承认，这十点所谓中国民族性的特点是“综合各方之所见”，而这“各方”不但包括一些帝国主义学者的著作，而且还有日寇编印的“支那人心理之研究”。这本反动的小册子是日本帝国主义者供给其侵华部队阅读，以鼓励他们征服中国之用的。（以上引文均见“中国文化要义”，页二四——二六）梁漱溟就是这样丧尽天良地帮助帝国主义从思想上来蹂躏中国民族和中国人民。
    从以上的简略的叙述中，我们看到，半殖民地半封建中国的封建地主阶级已经反动和堕落到了这种地步，以至在世界观、历史观这些根本思想问题上，甚至在宣扬封建主义文化当中，他们都不能不极大地依靠着帝国主义腐败思想的支持，并成为帝国主义各种反动、腐朽的思想的忠实传播者。
    二
    依靠和服务于帝国主义的这种反动本质在梁漱溟对于现代中国的政治问题的观点中表现得更加强烈和更加露骨。
    由于帝国主义的侵略，近代中国由封建社会沦入半殖民地半封建社会，中国社会的发展受到严重的阻碍。一切爱国的中国人都痛恨和反对帝国主义的侵略。但梁漱溟却认为“这真是非常庆幸的事，我愿谢天谢地”，因为帝国主义“对于中国的竞争压迫，杜绝了中国工商业的兴起，使中国免于资本主义化”（“乡村建设理论”以下简称“理论”，页三七八）。梁漱溟这样地欢迎帝国主义不是偶然的。梁漱溟是生活在社会主义革命的时代。在世界上，十月社会主义革命的胜利，各个资本主义国家的共产主义运动的日益高涨，在中国国内，马克思列宁主义的广泛传播，中国共产党领导的人民革命力量的迅速发展，面对这些情形，作为封建地主阶级代表的梁漱溟怀着极大的恐惧。他用反对资本主义的理由来欢迎帝国主义的侵略，实际上就是为了反对社会主义革命在中国的实现。他说，由于帝国主义的压迫，“八十年来极容易走上工业资本之路的，竟得幸而免，……这样，才留给我们今天讲乡村建设的机会。要不然，像俄国那样，形成一个半通不通的工业国家，最适宜于发生共产革命；那么，我们今天就不能讲乡村建设，而得讲共产主义了！”（同上）正是在阻碍中国社会的发展，反对中国人民走向社会主义、共产主义以取得彻底解放这个根本问题上，封建势力同帝国主义发现了他们的共同的利益和共同的命运，因而亲密地携起手来。梁漱溟对于封建势力必须依靠帝国主义才能存在这一点是有充分的自觉的。他说：“我们受他（指帝国主义）侵略既深且久，固一面吃亏愈大，而一面亦愈依赖于他”。“所以他若将其经济侵略手段一旦骤然撤回，我们便大起恐慌，支撑不住；反倒要哀垦于他‘请你还是侵略我罢！’”（“觉悟”，页一八四）这些话生动地描绘出封建地主阶级依赖帝国主义的丑态。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，坚决地展开了反对帝国主义和反对封建主义的革命斗争。这个斗争在一九二七年达到了第一个高峰。一九二七年的革命使梁漱溟感到极大的惊慌和恐惧。为了反对中国人民革命，他在一九二九—一九三一年写成了“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”一书。在这本反动的著作中，梁漱溟否认帝国主义的侵略，公开为帝国主义侵略中国辩护，对坚决反帝的革命人民进行恐吓，并污蔑和反对中国人民革命特别是中国共产党。梁漱溟在这本书中所散播的反动的政治思想，一直贯穿在他此后的某些行动和许多著作特别是“乡村建设理论”一书中。梁漱溟的这些反动言论，同买办洋奴胡适是完全一致的。本来，在为帝国主义效劳这一点上，比起买办资产阶级，封建地主阶级是毫无逊色的。
    梁漱溟虽然在口头上也用“帝国主义的压迫”这种字眼，但实际上他根本否认帝国主义的侵略，并始终为帝国主义侵略中国辩护，诋毁中国人民反对帝国主义的革命主张。他口口声声说，“帝国主义者不是真正革命对象”（“觉悟”，页一八五），“我……反对以帝国主义为革命对象的说法”（“答乡村建设批判”页五八），“我从来不同意那一种归咎帝国主义的流行说法”（“树立信用，力求合作”）。他认为旧中国同帝国主义的关系是“国际间的关系”，因此只“有外交可讲”，“却无革命可言”（“觉悟”，页一八五）。他更胡说什么中国问题“断不是以排开外面迫害为解决的”（同上，页一八二）。甚至在“七七”事变的前夕，他还公然说：“中国不应当在如何摧敌处着想，而应当在如何让敌人不容易毁灭我们处着想，乃至在我们被毁后如何容易恢复上着想”（“理论”，页四四一）。梁漱溟就是这样不顾事实地帮助帝国主义来欺骗中国人民，要中国人民不去反抗它，而向它妥协，投降。
    梁漱溟又向坚持反对帝国主义的斗争的中国革命人民进行无耻的恐吓。他说：“我们对帝国主义者，以武力反抗，或经济上不合作来反抗，眼前都不行；彼此力气强弱相悬，较量不来”（“觉悟”，页一八五）。梁漱溟的这种无耻的论调正是封建地主阶级发自内心的对帝国主义的恐惧和畏怯。当一九四○年日本帝国主义侵略者的铁蹄深入国境，全国人民已奋起抗战的时候，他竟公然宣称：“‘打倒帝国主义’，只可作一口号来倡说，临到事实上，我们并不能以武力向帝国主义者进攻”，“武力反抗，既属不智，亦不正确，亦不可能。乃至以经济不合作来反抗他，亦难作得到”（“答乡村建设批判”页二七、五八）。他又说，反帝“只是说说而已，实行上要走曲线。走直线刚强到底必然被消灭”（同上，页二八）。从这里，我们丝毫分辨不出梁漱溟同对日寇采取妥协、投降政策、高唱“曲线救国”的蒋介石卖国集团有什么不同之处。
    由马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国革命人民是不怕任何恐吓的。为了帮助帝国主义反对中国人民革命，梁漱溟就进一步对中国人民进行恶毒的污蔑。他说：“由于他（指帝国主义）加于我之欺凌侵略，犹属可计，而我颠倒迷扰以自贻伊戚者，乃真不可胜计，吾人今日所食之果，与其说为欧洲人日本人所加于我者，宁曰吾人所自造”（“觉悟”，页八八、八九）。这就是说，中国的问题不是因为帝国主义的侵略，而是中国人自己弄出来的，都怪中国人自己不好。后来他更直截了当地说：“国际的侵略压迫亦不能怪人家，而实由自己不能应付环境”（“理论”页九）。
    梁漱溟对抗日战争结束后美帝国主义在中国的阴谋是衷心拥护的。他不但在当时奴颜婢膝地称颂美帝国主义派到中国来的马歇尔的种种罪恶活动，甚至在一九四九年他还公然说：“马氏对中国和平之要求极其诚挚，颇受其感动。”“外间都以为马与蒋（介石）合起来压迫中共者，殊不尽然。”“马不算很不好，而七七纪念日，延安一篇宣言，却破口大骂美方。——当然马亦包在内。我总以为太过”（“过去和谈中我负疚之一事”）。梁漱溟在这里说的“延安一篇宣言”就是中共中央在一九四六年纪念“七七”九周年的宣言。在这宣言中指出了“美国反动派也在中国反动派的合作之下，企图代替日本的地位，变中国为美国帝国主义的殖民地”，指出了美国当时在中国的一切活动“实际上无一不是帮助了我国反动派的独裁和内战”。这个宣言号召全国爱国人民团结起来“击退外国帝国主义与中国反动派的联合进攻，为完成我国的独立与民主而奋斗”。因为这一个有重大历史意义的光辉文件在全中国和全世界人民面前彻底揭穿了美帝国主义者的面目，就使得梁漱溟至少难过了四年。
    中国共产党领导的人民民主革命的胜利，就是帝国主义和封建势力在中国的统治的彻底毁灭，所以，为了巩固帝国主义对中国的统治，保全封建地主阶级的生命，梁漱溟几十年来一直把他的反革命的刀锋指向中国共产党。在现代中国的政治生活中，谁反对共产党，谁就不可避免地为帝国主义压迫中国人民帮了忙。梁漱溟一贯地坚决地污蔑和反对中国共产党，是他的地主阶级的立场所决定的，也正表现了他的代表帝国主义利益，为帝国主义主子效劳的反动本质。
    三
    梁漱溟于一九三三至一九三七年在山东邹平等地实施的所谓“乡村建设运动”的目的就是在巩固帝国主义和封建势力对中国人民的统治。
    照梁漱溟说起来，中国农村的贫穷、落后是同帝国主义的侵略没有关系的，他说：“外力之破坏乡村尚属有限，我们感受外面刺激而起反应，自动的破坏乡村，殆十倍之不止”（“理论”页七）。所谓“自动的破坏乡村”，梁漱溟的意思乃是指近百年来的中国人民的革命运动特别是中国共产党领导的革命运动。他说：“近百年中，……中国人所作所为，一切维新革命民族自救，亦无非是破坏乡村”，而“共产党更文不对题，其破坏工作乃全用之于乡村”（同上，页六—七）。应该指出，梁漱溟的这种荒谬论调正是在地主阶级眼里对客观现实的一种反映。因为在地主阶级看来，帝国主义的侵略虽然影响到他们在农村中的“美好”的封建统治秩序，但是并没有破坏这种秩序，真正摧毁中国农村中的封建统治秩序的乃是共产党领导的革命运动。
    因此，梁漱溟的“乡村建设运动”是很明确地以反对共产党为目标的。他说：“诚然，共产党杀人放火，其为害亦与土匪差不多；但实际上这个问题不是这么简单。……自某一意义上来看，共产党的作为，实是中国的一种农民运动。……要想消除共产党的农民运动，必须另有一种农民运动起来替代才可以。我们的乡村组织除了一面从地方保卫上抵御共产党外，还有一面就是我们这种运动实为中国农民运动的正轨，可以替代共产党”。（同上，二七九—二八○）用什么和怎样来“替代共产党”，“消除共产党的农民运动”呢？据他说，就是实行“乡村建设运动”以“建设一个新的社会组织构成；——即建设新的礼俗”，而所谓“新的礼俗”“就是中国固有精神与西洋文化的长处二者为具体事实的沟通调和”。（同上，页一四一、一四三）这里，所谓“中国固有精神”就是中国封建主义的礼教和制度，所谓“西洋文化的长处”就是资本主义国家的比较严密的政治制度和统治秩序（即梁漱溟所经常赞美的“西洋人的团体生活”）。所以，梁漱溟的所谓建设“新的礼俗”就是利用一些资本主义、帝国主义国家统治人民的方法来维护和巩固中国半殖民地半封建的统治。
    一个给梁漱溟的“乡村建设运动”吹嘘的人说，“（梁漱溟等人）所最注重的，是借助于乡村领袖。大概较有智识、较有财产、较有声望，在一乡中有点地位的，他们都去拜访，必使他了解，得他同情，请他帮助。以前乡农学校的校董，现在乡学村学的‘学长’，以及乡理事村理事，都是由这班人充当的”（孔雪雄编：“中国今日之农村运动”，页一九）。这里所谓的乡农学校、乡学、村学就是梁漱溟的“乡村建设运动”的中心组织。梁漱溟自己也说：“我们的乡农学校也是靠乡村领袖的提倡才能成功。”“校董会中都是些领袖人物，再从校董中推出一个校长”。（“理论”，页二一六）请问在旧中国农村中“有智识”、“有财产”、“有声望”的“领袖人物”不是骑在农民头上吸吮农民血汗的地主阶级分子又是谁呢？依靠这些“领袖人物”的“了解”、“同情”和“提倡”而建立起来，并掌握在他们手中的乡农学校这类组织不是地主阶级统治农民的工具，还能是什么呢？
    乡农学校这类组织所做的事情，归纳起来，不外下列几个方面。
    首先，是加强地主阶级的特权，对农民灌输封建教育，施行所谓“精神陶炼”。乡农学校有“学众须知、学董须知、学长须知、教员辅导员须知”等一系列的规定。从这些规定里，我们可以看到，地主阶级是居于统治的特权地位。例如乡长（即校长、学长）是“站在最高的地位，对一乡的人，他是站在一个监督教训的地位”，他“超居众人之上”，“来监督众人，调和众人”。而农民必须“尊敬学长”、“接受学长的训饬”。“校董”、“理事”都是乡长决定的，如果农民对“校董”、“理事”这些地主分子不满，则必须“避免正面冲突”，只能“以友谊进一言”，而且“最好有话对学长先说，由学长转告他”。至于“处于超然地位”的学长（以上引文均见“理论”，页二三五——二四三），那更是农民所不能反对的了。农民在乡农学校里经常要听灌输“中国的旧道理”即中国封建礼教，和国民党“党义”的“精神讲话”（“乡农学校办法及其意义”）。梁漱溟就是这样周密和细致地来巩固农村中的封建统治秩序，要农民做地主阶级的俯首贴耳的驯服的奴隶。
    其次，是建立和训练地主阶级的武装，用以镇压农民运动。梁漱溟自己供认：“现在政府里提倡乡村自卫，……如在江西、安徽、湖南、湖北等省共产党闹得最厉害的地方，单靠军队去剿是不行的。……要农民（按应是地主阶级）自己起来防御共匪”（“乡村建设大意”，页四○——四一）。这批地主阶级的武装“遇事则召集迅速，即时可以成军。名为强固之后备，实为常备之民兵”（“山东乡村建设研究院及邹平实验区概况”）。这就是说，在必要时，还可以作为反动政府的兵源补充。
    此外，还有所谓乡村的“经济建设”工作，即组织所谓运销、信用“合作社”、进行推广美棉种籽之类的农业技术改良。既然如上面所分析的，一切都由地主阶级所操纵，农民受着极端严密的封建统治，农村中的封建生产关系不但没有改变，相反的得到大大的巩固，那末所谓“合作社”、农业技术改良必然是从地主富农的利益出发的，这还用证明么。这里特别需要指出的是，如果说上述加强农村中的封建统治是梁漱溟帮助帝国主义巩固其统治中国特别是中国农村的基础的话，那末他的所谓乡村经济建设就是直接替帝国主义向中国农村扩大市场，加强其对中国农民的剥削。
    梁漱溟组织所谓“合作社”，进行农业技术改良，据说是为了“恢复农业生产力”，使农村的“一般购买力从而增进”，于是就可以使“工业因需要之刺激而兴起”。“从农业引发工业，更从工业推进农业，农业工业叠为推引，产业乃日进无疆”（“理论”页三八八—三八九）。显然，这完全是自欺欺人的鬼话。
    大家知道，在半殖民地半封建的中国，一切经济命脉都操在帝国主义手里，不改变这种状况，要发展民族工业、实现工业化、提高农村的生产力都是根本不可能的梦想。帝国主义对中国人民的压榨是有增无已的。在一九三○—一九三三年间，处在空前巨大的经济危机当中的各个帝国主义国家都急于要向殖民地落后国家扩张自己的商品、原料和资本市场。有着广大人口的中国特别是中国农村尤其为他们所注意。帝国主义一面希望提高中国农村的购买力，以更多地倾销他们的工业品；一面要求中国农村能够供给他们以更廉价、更适合他们工业生产需要的原料。这也就是当时代表帝国主义利益的国联之所以特别热心于“复兴中国农村”的真正原因。
    梁漱溟当时的所谓“把外面都市的资金输进内地农村，使金融在枯窘的农村中，可以活泼流通起来”、“将科学技术引进内地农村”，以“增加农产原料之输出”（同上，页三○二、三八六、三○一）等等的所谓“经济建设”工作，正是反映了当时帝国主义的上述要求。他的所谓“恢复农业生产力”、“增进”“农村购买力”、不仅对地主阶级有利，同时也就是替帝国主义扩大商品和原料的市场，帮助帝国主义进一步剥削和压榨中国农民。梁漱溟的这套所谓乡村“经济建设”工作正是“农业中国，工业日本”这类使中国殖民地化的帝国主义论调的具体实现。这一点，中国的一些进步的经济学家在当时就曾正确地指出过了（参看一九三六年出版的“中国乡村建设批判”）。
    由此可见，梁漱溟的“乡村建设运动”就是巩固中国半殖民地半封建的统治秩序，直接为帝国主义服务的一套反动措施。它和蒋介石国民党的封建买办法西斯的统治是完全一致的，——正像他自己所说的，“我们与政府（即蒋介石反动政府）是彼此相处的，而非不相容的”（“理论”附录，页八）。——所不同的是梁漱溟更注意从“下面”用“软工夫”，从思想上来麻醉和统治人民而已。因此，梁漱溟的“乡村建设运动”以及和它相类似的其他“乡村运动”，既得到蒋介石反动政权的帮助，也得到帝国主义的支持。这些“乡村工作的财源，不外两个来历：一是从政府来的；一是从外国来的”（同上，页九）。“从外国来的”财源是什么呢？原来就是“美国煤油大王”为了“提倡乡村建设”，想“帮助乡村运动团体”的“捐款”（“乡村建设大意”，页三六—三七）。——这都是梁漱溟自己的招供。
    根据以上所述，我们可以清楚地看到，为了统治和奴役中国人民，为了反对人民革命，国内封建势力同帝国主义紧密地结合在一起，它们的利益是完全一致的。这种一致性在梁漱溟多少年间的言行中是表现得十分明确的。
