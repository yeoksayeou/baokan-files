　　The Translation Quality of Science and Technology Books Must Be Improved
　　Da Ke
　　With the gradual unfolding of our country's large-scale economic construction, learning advanced science and technology from the Soviet Union has become the unanimous demand of the broad masses of the people. This demand of the broad masses of the people is entirely understandable: only by earnestly learning the achievements of Soviet science and technology can we improve the level of science and technology in our country. Therefore, the translation and publishing circles of science and technology books must treat their work with a serious and responsible attitude and try to improve the quality of translation. Otherwise, translations of poor quality will not only fail to achieve the purpose of introducing and disseminating the achievements of Soviet science and technology, but will also cause readers to make mistakes in their practical work. Especially at a time when students in various colleges and universities are overburdened with their studies, since many of these books are used as textbooks or reference books in colleges and universities, poor translations will inevitably increase the burden on students.
　　Over the past few years, the translation and publishing circles in our country have made great efforts in this regard. However, the quality of many translations is still far from satisfactory. Some books are full of mistranslations. For example, readers Yu Dawei, Zhong Fuquan, and Fang Li wrote to criticize the book "Preparation of Ores Before Smelting" (translated by Ji Yanling, Zou Yunlin, and Dong Zisheng, reviewed by Zao Zhoutong and Tong Guoguang, published by the Heavy Industry Publishing House). One sentence on page 292 of this book, "Sintering is similar to agglomeration and is not just a way to agglomerate ore," is completely different from the original meaning. The original meaning is: "Sintering, in contrast to agglomeration, is not only a way to agglomerate ore." Reader Xue Qiwen wrote to criticize the book "Refractory Materials" (translated by Ma Shouzeng and Jiang Zenghai, proofread by Lei Tianzhuang, published by the Heavy Industry Publishing House). One sentence on page 48 of this book, "The power required to sieve one ton of clay with a separator is two to three times more than with a vibrating screen." This is also inconsistent with the original meaning. Here, "two to three times" should be translated as "one to two times," and the translator exaggerated the energy consumption of the separator (compared to the vibrating screen) by one time.
　　Stilted and unreadable translations are also a common phenomenon. For example, "reduce by several times" is a foreign way of speaking "Chinese." Because "reduce" can only be "a fraction of," and cannot be "several times." However, in the book "Refractory Materials," wherever it should be translated as "reduce by a fraction," it is translated as "reduce by several times," which makes it difficult to understand. On page 365 of "Preparation of Ores Before Smelting" there is also a sentence, "The sieve bar gap of twenty-five millimeters may be flat or stepped." May I ask, how can a "bar gap" be "flat or stepped"? Originally, the meaning of the original text is: "The sieve bar gap is twenty-five millimeters, and the sieve can be installed flat or stepped."
　　Faithfulness to the original is one of the basic principles of translation work. However, some books arbitrarily delete or tamper with the original text. According to reader Su Xiaomei's letter, the book "Elementary Electrical Engineering" (translated by Zhang Zhongzhen, published by Shanghai Zhongwai Book Company) is a typical example. The translator of this book has made many deletions to the original work, arbitrarily tampered with and written it, and arbitrarily divided the order of the original text. For example, on page 24 of this book, three major paragraphs are completely omitted; on page 34, as many as nine lines are replaced by self-writing instead of translation; in the section "Ohm's Law" on page 10, in addition to deleting two paragraphs, the remaining twenty-one paragraphs are divided into twenty-eight paragraphs, and the order of this section is completely disrupted.
　　At present, there are no unified regulations for the translation of many nouns and terms, but translators should also try to use commonly used ones. The nouns and terms in many books are translated inaccurately, and some are obviously mistranslated. For example, on page 77 of the book "Refractory Materials," "thermal spectrum" is translated as "thermal curve"; on page 176, "refractive index" is translated as "refractive index"; and on page 228, "filler" is translated as "filling material." On page 1 of "Preparation of Ores Before Smelting," "national economy" is translated as "people's cause"; on page 2, "Academician of the Academy of Sciences" is translated as "Science Committee member"; and on page 293, even "alkaline oxide" is translated as "basic oxide."
　　From this, it can be seen that there are still many shortcomings in our country's translation and publishing circles in introducing Soviet science and technology. This requires translators to strengthen their sense of responsibility, which is a prerequisite for improving the quality of translation. This also requires translators to have a certain level of proficiency in Russian, Chinese, their own business, and general social knowledge. However, since the general level of translation in the domestic scientific community is not high enough at present, and readers' needs for Soviet science and technology are very urgent, it is unrealistic to demand too much from translators. The important issue is that the publishing circles should better organize the translation force. Some publishing houses organize professional personnel for collective translation, which is a good method. In addition, given the current low level of translation, it is of particularly great significance to improve the review system of publishing houses. Some publishing houses adopt mutual review and proofreading between translators and reviewers, collective review by responsible editors and expert professors, or hire comrades from outside the company to be responsible for review, and these methods are also better. In short, the translation and publishing circles must strengthen their work, and in particular, publishing houses must improve their review system. Only in this way can the translation of Soviet science and technology books meet the requirements of good, fast, and many, so as to better meet the needs of readers.

### 科学技术书籍的翻译质量必须提高

　　科学技术书籍的翻译质量必须提高
　　大可
    由于我们国家大规模经济建设的逐步开展，向苏联学习先进的科学技术已成为广大人民的一致要求。广大人民的这种要求是完全可以理解的：只有认真学习苏联科学技术的成就，才能提高我国科学技术的水平。因此，科学技术书籍的翻译界和出版界必须以严肃负责的态度来对待自己的工作，尽量提高翻译的质量水平。否则，质量低劣的翻译不仅不能达到介绍和传播苏联科学技术成就的目的，反而会使读者在实际工作中发生错误。特别是在目前各高等学校中都存在学生课业负担过重的情况下，由于这些书很多是被高等学校用作教科书或参考书的，所以拙劣的翻译势必越发加重学生的负担。
    几年以来，我国的翻译界和出版界曾在这方面作了很大的努力。但是，不少翻译的质量仍然很难令人满意。有的书中误译层出。例如，读者俞大伟、钟馥铨和方黎来信对“冶炼前矿石的准备”
  （纪延龄、邹运琳、董子升译，藻周同、童国光审阅，重工业出版社出版）一书提出批评。这本书第二九二页中有一句，“烧结与团矿相似而不只是矿石造块的一种方式”，这就译得和原文意思完全不相同了。原意是：“烧结同团矿相反，不仅是矿石造块的一种方式”。读者薛启文来信对“耐火材料”（马守增、蒋增海译，雷天壮校阅，重工业出版社出版）一书提出批评。这本书第四十八页中有一句，“用分离机筛析一吨粘土所需要的电力，比用振动筛要多二—三倍。”这也是同原意不符的。这里，“二—三倍”应译作“一—二倍”，译者是把分离机的能量消耗（同振动筛比较）夸大一倍了。
    译文的生硬不通，也是普遍现象。例如，“减少几倍”这是外国的“中国话”。因为“减少”只能是
  “几分之几”，而不可能是“几倍”。但是，“耐火材料”一书中，对凡应译作“减少几分之几”的地方，都译作“减少几倍”，这就叫人不知应该怎样理解了。“冶炼前矿石的准备”一书第三六五页中还有一句，“筛子条缝二十五公厘可能是平的或者台阶式”。试问，“条缝”怎会是“平的或者台阶式的”呢？原来，原文的意思是：“筛子的条缝为二十五公厘，筛子可以装成平的或者台阶式的”。
    对原文的忠实，这是翻译工作的基本原则之一。但是，有的书对原文任意删节或窜改。根据读者苏小美的来信，“初等电工学”（张仲真译，上海中外书局出版）一书，就是一个典型的例子。这本书的译者对原著大加删节，不顾原文任意窜改和撰写，以及随心所欲割裂原文的次序。例如，这本书的第二十四页中，整整漏掉了三大段；第三十四页中，以自写来代替翻译的即达九行之多；第十页“欧姆定律”一节中，除删掉两段，把剩下的二十一段分为二十八段外，并且把这一节的次序完全搅乱了。
    目前，很多名词术语的翻译还没有统一的规定，但是，翻译者也应该尽量采用通常使用的。不少书中的名词术语译得很不确切，有些明显地被译错了。例如，“耐火材料”一书第七十七页中，将“热谱”译为“热曲线”；第一七六页中，将“折光率”译为“折光指数”；以及第二二八页中，将“填料”译为“充填物”。“冶炼前矿石的准备”一书第一页中，将“国民经济”译为“人民事业”；第二页中，将“科学院士”译为“科学委员”；以及第二九三页中，甚至将“碱性氧化物”译为“基本氧化物”。
    由此可见，目前我国翻译界和出版界在介绍苏联科学技术方面，是还存在着不少缺点的。这就要求翻译者必须加强自己的责任心，这是提高翻译质量的先决条件。这还要求翻译者在俄文、中文、本门业务和一般社会知识方面都具有一定水平。但是，由于目前国内科学界的翻译水平一般还不够高，而读者对于苏联科学技术的需要又十分迫切，所以对于翻译者的条件要求过高是不切实际的。重要的问题还在于出版界更好地组织翻译的力量。有的出版社组织专业人员进行集体翻译，这是一个较好的办法。此外，根据目前翻译界水平不高的情况，健全出版社的审校制度更有其特别重大的意义。有的出版社采取译者校者互审互校，责任编辑同专家教授集体审校，或者聘请社外同志负责审校，这些办法也都是较好的。总之，翻译界和出版界必须加强自己工作，特别是出版社必须健全自己的审校制度。只有这样，才能使苏联科学技术书籍的翻译达到好、快、多的要求，以更好地满足读者的需要。
