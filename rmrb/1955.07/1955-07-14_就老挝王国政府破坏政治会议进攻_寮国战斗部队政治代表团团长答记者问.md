Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th (Dispatch): According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 12th: Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units attending the Lao political conference, refuted the slander that the Lao Fighting Units attacked the Kingdom's army in response to questions raised by the "Liberation Daily" reporter, and pointed out that the Lao Kingdom Government should be held responsible for interrupting the political conference and provoking military conflicts.

Phoumi Vongvichit pointed out that since the Lao Fighting Units and the Lao Kingdom Government reached an agreement on March 9 to cease hostilities, the Kingdom Government launched more than 20 attacks, large and small, on the Lao Fighting Units in Muong Bon and Hoi Tao from April 19 to April 29. From the end of May to the present, the Kingdom Government has dispatched nearly four battalions from Xieng Khouang to Sam Neua. The Kingdom's 8th Battalion and other troops, in conjunction with other existing armed groups, continuously launched attacks on the Lao Fighting Units in areas southeast of Muong Bon, Na Muong, Bon Van, Na Kang, Na Khon, Ba Pei, Na Sang, and Na Sala from June 1st to June 30th. Currently, the Kingdom Government continues to dispatch more armed forces from the ten provinces under its control to attack the Lao Fighting Units within the regrouping areas. Despite this, Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith of the Kingdom Government constantly insists that the Lao Fighting Units attacked the Kingdom's army. The purpose of this trick of crying "stop thief" is to deceive public opinion at home and abroad, prolong the interruption of the Lao political conference, and prepare for a larger-scale offensive.

In answering the question about the reasons for the interruption of the Lao political conference, Phoumi Vongvichit said: The truth is that at a meeting held on April 20, 1955, to discuss the tasks of the political consultative committee to be established, the delegation of the Lao Kingdom Government raised the issue of jurisdiction over the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and declared that the political consultative committee should be placed under the control of the Kingdom Government. The Lao delegation agreed to discuss the issue of the two provinces and the tasks of the political consultative committee, and put forward the following four suggestions: (1) To resolve all disputes and prevent such disputes from breaking out throughout the country. (2) To guarantee all democratic freedoms of the people. (3) To prepare for free general elections throughout the country. (4) As for the suggestion to place the political consultative committee under the control of the Kingdom Government, the Lao delegation believes that this is not a fair and reasonable solution at all. Therefore, the Lao delegation suggested that the representatives of each party participating in this committee should be responsible to their respective superiors, because this committee will be composed of representatives of the parties concerned with equal qualifications. The Lao side's suggestions are fully in line with the spirit and letter of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference.

However, at the meeting on April 24, 1955, the Kingdom Government not only rejected these suggestions, but also interrupted the meeting. As a result, the political conference was interrupted for the sixth time, and this stalemate continues to drag on. At the same time, the Kingdom Government continued to carry out military attacks on the two regrouping provinces of the Lao Fighting Units, and appointed governors for the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and also established provincial administrative committees in Muong Bon and Poung Nou.

The above-mentioned arguments and activities prove that the responsible persons of the Kingdom Government are not sincerely willing to negotiate with the Lao side. On the contrary, they intend to keep the political conference in a state of interruption, so as to gradually invade the above-mentioned two provinces by military means.

In answering the question about what efforts the Lao side has made to restore the political conference, Phoumi Vongvichit said: For the supreme interests of the motherland, with the desire to negotiate sincerely with the Kingdom Government so as to jointly ensure the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units is still staying in Vientiane. We have met with Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith and the delegation of the Kingdom Government many times and wrote letters to them, requesting an early resumption of negotiations. However, the Kingdom Government has not yet responded. In a recent letter sent to the Lao Fighting Units, Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith said that the political conference could only be restored if the Lao side agreed to place the political consultative committee under the control of the Kingdom Government. It can be said that the Kingdom Government hopes to turn the political consultative committee into a surrender committee. The above-mentioned arguments and actions prove that Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith is not negotiating in a spirit of equality and sincerity.

### 就老挝王国政府破坏政治会议进攻  寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长答记者问

    就老挝王国政府破坏政治会议进攻
    寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长答记者问
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南通讯社十二日讯：出席老挝政治会议的寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长富米在回答“解放报”记者提出的问题时，驳斥了所谓寮国战斗部队进攻王国军队的谰言，并且指出，是老挝王国政府方面应当对中断政治会议和挑起军事冲突负责任。
    富米指出，从寮国战斗部队同老挝王国政府在三月九日达成停止敌对行动的协议以后，王国政府方面曾经从四月十九日到四月二十九日在芒奔和会头对寮国战斗部队发动大小进攻在二十次以上。从五月底到现在，王国政府从川圹派遣了将近四个营到桑怒去。王国方面的第八营和其他部队同其他现存的武装集团联合行动，从六月一日到三十日在芒奔东南、那芒、本玩、那岗、那空、巴培、那桑和那萨拉等地连续地对寮国战斗部队发动进攻。目前，王国政府仍然继续从它控制下的十个省份派遣更多的武装部队去攻击在集结区以内的寮国战斗部队。尽管如此，王国政府首相克特还是不断地硬说，寮国战斗部队攻击了王国军队。这种贼喊捉贼的诡计的目的在于欺骗国内外的公共舆论，延长老挝政治会议的中断，并且准备进行更大规模的进攻。
    富米在回答关于老挝政治会议中断的原因时说：真相是，在一九五五年四月二十日举行的政治会议讨论要成立的政治协商委员会任务的一次会议上，老挝王国政府代表团提出了对桑怒和丰沙里两省的管辖问题，并且宣称：政治协商委员会应当置于王国政府的控制下。寮国代表团同意讨论两省问题和政治协商委员会的任务问题，同时提出了如下四点建议：（一）解决一切纷争并且防止这类纷争在全国范围内爆发。（二）保证人民的一切民主自由。（三）准备在全国举行自由普选。（四）至于把政治协商委员会置于王国政府控制下的建议，寮国代表团认为这根本不是公平合理的解决办法。因此，寮国代表团建议参加这个委员会的每一方的代表将对他们各自的上级负责，因为这个委员会将由有关双方同等资格的代表组成。寮国方面的建议完全符合于日内瓦会议最后宣言的精神和文字。
    但是在一九五五年四月二十四日会议上，王国政府方面不仅拒绝了这些建议，而且中断了会议。这样一来，政治会议第六次陷于中断，而且这个僵局仍在拖下去。同时，王国政府方面继续对寮国战斗部队的两个集结省份进行军事攻击，并且任命了桑怒和丰沙里两省的省长，还在芒奔和磅怒设立了省行政委员会。
    上述的论点和活动证明，王国政府的负责方面人士并不是真诚地愿意同寮国方面进行谈判。相反的，他们打算使政治会议继续陷于中断状态，以便用军事手段逐渐侵入上述两省。
    在回答关于寮国方面作了什么努力来使政治会议恢复的问题时，富米说：为了祖国的最高利益，怀着和王国政府方面真诚谈判的愿望，以便一起保证正确地履行日内瓦协定，寮国战斗部队政治代表团仍然留在万象，我们曾经多次会见克特首相和王国政府代表团并且写信给他们，要求早日恢复谈判。但是王国政府还没有给予答复。克特首相在最近寄给寮国战斗部队的一封信中说，只有寮国方面同意把政治协商委员会置于王国政府控制之下，政治会议才能恢复。可以这样说，王国政府方面希望把政治协商委员会变成一种归顺委员会。上述论点和行为证明，克特首相并没有怀着平等和诚意的精神来进行谈判。
