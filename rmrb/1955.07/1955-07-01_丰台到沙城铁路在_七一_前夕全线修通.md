Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The workers constructing the Fengtai-Shacheng Railway completed the entire line before the Chinese Communist Party's birthday – "July 1st," victoriously fulfilling their promised guarantee. On June 30th, the east and west sections of the railway connected at Bridge No. 5. On the morning of the 30th, after a double-arm bridge-laying machine placed the final span on the bridge pier, the track-laying workers busily laid the final 28 meters of track.

The construction of the Fengsha Railway began in 1952 and was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 1955. In April of this year, all the workers on the line proposed the slogan of guaranteeing completion of the entire line by "July 1st" and universally launched a labor emulation campaign. Soviet experts also personally went to the construction site to help solve many technical problems; the Ministry of Railways also transferred skilled workers from Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places to provide support. Therefore, the final major projects were successfully completed, and the entire line was completed ahead of schedule.

The Fengsha Railway starts from Fengtai, follows the Yongding River, goes upstream westward, crosses the mountains of the Taihang Mountains, bypasses the Guanting Reservoir, and connects with the Beijing-Baotou Railway in Shacheng, Hebei Province. It is 105 kilometers long. The Beijing-Baotou Railway is an important transportation artery running through North China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia, but the section from Nankou to Kangzhuang between Beijing and Shacheng must pass through the dangerous Juyongguan and Badaling. The railway meanders around the mountains, with many curves and steep slopes, which limits the transportation capacity. Therefore, the Central People's Government decided to build this railway from Fengtai to Shacheng to undertake the main transportation tasks of the section of the Beijing-Baotou Railway east of Shacheng.

### 丰台到沙城铁路在“七一”前夕全线修通

　　丰台到沙城铁路在“七一”前夕全线修通
    新华社三十日讯　修建丰（台）沙（城）铁路的职工，在中国共产党的生日——“七一”前夕将铁路全线修通，胜利地完成了他们提出的保证。六月三十日，东西两边铁路在五号桥上接轨。三十日上午，双臂式架桥机把最后一孔桥梁放在桥墩上后，铺轨工人紧张地铺设了最后的二十八公尺轨道。
    丰沙铁路从一九五二年开始修建，原计划一九五五年年底修通。今年四月份，全线职工就提出了保证“七一”修通全线的口号，普遍开展了劳动竞赛。苏联专家也亲自到工地，帮助解决了许多技术问题；铁道部还从上海、武汉等地抽调技术工人前来支援。因此顺利地完成了最后各项主要工程，提前修通全线。
    丰沙铁路从丰台起，沿着永定河，向西溯流而上，穿越太行山余脉的山岭，绕过官厅水库，在河北省沙城和北京到包头的铁路衔接，全长一百零五公里。京包铁路是贯穿华北、西北和内蒙古的重要交通干线，但从北京到沙城间的南口到康庄要经过天险居庸关、八达岭，铁路顺着山势迂回环绕，弯道多，坡度大，运输量受到限制。因此中央人民政府决定修建这条从丰台到沙城的铁路，以担负起京包铁路沙城以东一段的主要运输任务。
