Jiangsu Cotton Mill Incorporates "Peach-Picked Cotton" in Spinning

The Jiangsu Provincial Textile Bureau organized various cotton mills to successfully experiment with incorporating "peach-picked cotton" into raw cotton for spinning, while ensuring product quality.

"Peach-picked cotton" refers to immature cotton picked by hand due to water damage. In 1954, most of the raw cotton purchased in Jiangsu Province below the medium grade was "peach-picked cotton," amounting to approximately 400,000 dan.

Starting in February of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Textile Bureau, in conjunction with relevant units, organized cotton mills in Nantong, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places to test spin with different proportions of "peach-picked cotton." It was found that cotton knots and impurities generally increased, and the production rate continuously declined, seriously affecting the quality of cotton yarn. Subsequently, each factory organized various professional production meetings and technical research conferences. Based on the characteristics of "peach-picked cotton," corresponding improvements were made in equipment, organizational systems, operations, and technical leadership, giving all employees the confidence and methods to overcome difficulties. After repeated test spins, each factory achieved better and better results, and from leaders to the masses, they gradually became familiar with the properties of "peach-picked cotton."

The Jiangsu Provincial Textile Bureau held a special meeting at the end of March to exchange and summarize the experience of test spinning "peach-picked cotton." Since April, cotton mills have generally incorporated a certain proportion of "peach-picked cotton" into formal production. At present, cotton mills have not only ensured product quality, but also increased the amount of "peach-picked cotton" incorporated into raw cotton. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

　　江苏棉纺厂掺用“剥桃棉”纺纱
    江苏省纺织管理局组织各棉纺织厂在保证产品质量的前提下试验在原棉中掺用“剥桃棉”纺纱成功。
    “剥桃棉”就是用人工剥取的因受水灾而未成熟的棉花。一九五四年江苏省收购的棉花中，中级以下的原棉大部分是“剥桃棉”，约有四十万担。
    今年二月份起，江苏省纺织管理局会同有关单位，先后在南通、常州、无锡等地组织棉纺织厂掺用不同比例的“剥桃棉”试纺时，棉结杂质普遍增加，制成率不断下降，严重影响了棉纱的质量。接着，各厂组织了各种专业生产会议和技术研究会，根据“剥桃棉”的特点，从设备上、组织制度上、操作上和技术领导上作了相应的改进，使全体职工有了克服困难的信心和办法。各厂又经过反复试纺，成绩一次比一次好，从领导人员到职工群众，慢慢地都摸熟了“剥桃棉”的性质。
    江苏省纺织管理局在三月底召开专门会议，交流和总结了试纺“剥桃棉”的经验。四月份起，各棉纺织厂普遍掺用一定比例的“剥桃棉”正式投入生产。目前，各棉纺织厂不仅保证了产品质量，而且在原棉中所掺用的“剥桃棉”的数量也有了增加。　（本报驻南京记者）
