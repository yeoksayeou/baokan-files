Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 26th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam, based on the findings of the mobile inspection team, has reached a conclusion regarding the issue of freedom of movement for residents in Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh provinces in northern Vietnam. In a letter written to the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army on July 18th, the International Commission stated: The investigations conducted in Hà Tĩnh province and the Lưu Mỹ area (Nghệ An province) show that the residents who wish to move south from Đức Ninh, Đức Thọ, and Đức An have all received permits and have already left; "Almost all of the people in Lưu Mỹ who wanted to move south have received permits and have left."

It is noted that the French side filed a complaint in May, alleging that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was "obstructing" people from moving south, especially in the Lưu Mỹ area of Nghệ An province and Đức Ninh, Đức Thọ, and Đức An in Hà Tĩnh province. Subsequently, the International Commission dispatched a mobile inspection team to conduct on-site investigations.

    就流美等地居民迁移自由问题
    越南国际委员会作出结论
    新华社河内二十六日讯　据越南通讯社报道：越南国际监督和监察委员会根据机动视察小组调查的结果，已经就越南北方义安省和河静省的居民迁移自由问题作出结论。国际委员会在七月十八日写给越南人民军总司令部联络代表团一封信，信中说：在河静省和流美地区（义安省）所进行的调查表明：希望从德宁、德罗、德安迁移到南方去的居民都已经得到了许可证，并且已经离开了；“差不多流美的所有要迁移到南方去的人都得到了许可证，并且已经离去了”。
    按法方在五月间曾提出一项申诉，说什么越南民主共和国政府“阻挠”人民南迁，特别是在义安省的流美地区和河静省的德宁、德罗、德安。此后，国际委员会便派遣了一个机动视察小组去进行实地调查。
