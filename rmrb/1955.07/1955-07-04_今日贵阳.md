　　Today's Guiyang

　　Guiyang City has taken on a completely new look in recent years. In the past, people often used "stinky water fills the city, roads are rough and uneven" to describe the city. Now, Zhonghua Road, which runs through the most prosperous part of the city, has been completely renovated and paved with flat, orderly concrete pavement. Before liberation, there was not a single road in the city with bus service. Now, Zhonghua Road, Huancheng Road, Guihui Road, Zhongshan West Road and other major streets have been opened to traffic successively. The newly built and wide Yan'an Road has been partially opened to traffic. The roads in the city leading to scenic spots have also been renovated and repaired. Now, on holidays, large numbers of tourists take buses to the Labor People's Cultural Palace, Nanming Park and the famous Huaxi in the province for sightseeing. The once very polluted Guancheng River has been dredged and cleared. The city's tap water network is expanding daily. Now, more than 70 percent of the city's residents can enjoy cheap and clean tap water.

　　The Guiyang Bus Station was newly built in February this year at the western end of Yan'an Road. Salt and cloth needed by various ethnic minority areas throughout the province, as well as lace and embroidered silk thread favored by ethnic minority women, are mostly transported from here; local specialties such as flue-cured tobacco, tung oil, timber, wool, and medicinal materials produced in ethnic minority areas are also continuously collected here and transferred to various places. At present, 80 percent of the province's 79 counties where various ethnic groups live in concentrated communities or are scattered have built roads, and more than 10,000 kilometers of rural roads have also been repaired. The areas where ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Buyi, and Yao people live in concentrated communities throughout the province have been closely linked to Guiyang City, the center of the province.

　　Before liberation, although there were some factories in Guiyang, most of them were outdated in equipment and dilapidated in their factory buildings. After liberation, the People's Government newly built, renovated and expanded more than a dozen factories and enterprises in Guiyang, such as the Guiyang Power Plant Smelting Plant, Cement Plant, Paper Mill, Glass Factory, Food Factory, Chemical Factory, Farm Tool Factory, Tobacco Company, and Transportation Machinery Repair Plant. The establishment and expansion of these factories have played a significant role in supporting national construction, supporting agricultural production and supplying people's daily needs. The Guiyang Power Plant Smelting Plant, which was newly built in 1952, continuously smelts high-quality ferromanganese and transports it to steel plants in Anshan, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places. The Guiyang Cement Plant, which serves the province's basic construction, has seen great development in production in recent years, with output increasing by about 20 times compared with before liberation. In the first quarter of this year, the Cement Plant has already begun to transport its products to Yunnan to support the key construction projects in Yunnan Province. At present, the new factory buildings of the Cement Plant have all been completed, and the equipment installation project is underway. It is expected that within this year, the Cement Plant will use new equipment to produce more and better cement for the country. The Guizhou Farm Tool Manufacturing Plant, which is about to start expanding in July this year, is now trial-producing new-style farm tools such as corn threshers. Not long ago, this factory manufactured a batch of hillside plows to support the spring plowing production of farmers of all ethnic groups. The relevant departments have also organized many handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft production teams to produce iron farm tools, silk scarves, fancy threads, headscarves and other items for ethnic minority people.

　　In recent years, many new enterprises serving the people's lives have also emerged in Guiyang City. In the central area of the city, the department store building, which began construction in June 1954, officially opened for business on June 1 this year. Diagonally opposite this department store is the newly built Xinhua Bookstore, and not far from here are the newly built People's Theater and Guiyang Hotel. At the same time, the new school buildings of Guiyang No. 6 Middle School and Normal College have been completed. At present, there are three institutions of higher learning, sixteen secondary schools and more than forty primary schools in the city. The number of primary school students has increased by about one and a half times compared with the early days of liberation, the number of middle school students has increased by more than two times, and the number of college students has also increased by 50 percent. In addition, there are more than a dozen kindergartens in the city.

　　今日贵阳
　　萧岭梅
    贵阳市几年来已经面貌一新。过去，人们常用“臭水满山城，坎坷路不平”来形容这个城市。现在，纵贯市区最繁荣的地方的中华路，已经翻修一新，铺上了平坦整齐的混凝土路面。解放以前，全市没有一条路通公共汽车，现在中华路、环城路、贵惠路、中山西路等主要街道都已经陆续通车。新建的一条宽阔的延安路已经部分通车。市内通往风景区的公路也经过了翻修整理。现在每当假日，总有大量游人乘公共汽车，到劳动人民文化宫、南明公园和全省闻名的花溪等地游览。过去十分污浊的贯城河，已经疏浚通畅。全市自来水网日益扩大，现在全市百分之七十以上的居民都能吃到既便宜又清洁的自来水。
    在延安路西首，今年二月新建成了贵阳汽车站。全省各少数民族地区需要的盐巴、布匹，少数民族妇女喜爱的花边、绣花丝线等物品，大都从这里运出；少数民族地区出产的烤烟、桐油、木材、羊毛、药材等土特产品也源源不断地汇集到这里转运各地。目前，全省七十九个各民族聚居和散居的县份中，已经有百分之八十的县修通了公路，一万多公里的乡村道路也经过了修整。全省苗族、布依族、徭族等少数民族聚居地区，都已经和全省中心——贵阳市紧密地连成了一片。
    解放以前，贵阳虽有一些工厂，但大都设备陈旧，厂房破烂。解放以后，人民政府在贵阳新建、改建和扩建了贵阳电厂冶炼所、水泥厂、造纸厂、玻璃厂、食品厂、化学工厂、农具厂、烟草公司、交通机械修配厂等十几个工厂企业。这些工厂的建立和扩充，对支援国家建设、支持农业生产和供应人民生活需要起了很大作用。一九五二年新建的贵阳电厂冶炼所，不断冶炼出质量优良的锰铁运往鞍山、太原、上海、重庆等地的钢铁厂。为全省基本建设服务的贵阳水泥厂，几年来生产有很大发展，产量比解放以前提高了二十倍左右。今年第一季度，水泥厂已经开始把产品运往云南，支援云南省的重点建设。现在，水泥厂的新厂房已经全部建成，设备安装工程正在进行。预计今年内，水泥厂就将用新的设备为国家生产更多更好的水泥。今年七月即将动工扩建的贵州农具制造厂，现在正在试制玉米脱粒机等新式农具。不久以前，这个厂曾经制造出一批山地犁，支援了各族农民的春耕生产。有关部门还组织了许多手工业生产合作社和手工业生产小组，为少数民族人民生产铁制农具、丝帕、花线、头巾等物品。
    为人民生活服务的新企业，几年来在贵阳市也出现了不少。在市中心区，一九五四年六月开始兴修的百货大楼，已经在今年六月一日正式开始营业。在这座百货大楼的斜对面是新建的新华书店，离这里不远的地方有新建的人民剧场和贵阳饭店。同时，贵阳第六中学和师范学院的新校舍已经建成。现在全市共有三所高等学校、十六所中等学校和四十多所小学。小学生人数比解放初期增加了一倍半左右，中学生增加了两倍多，大学生也增加了百分之五十。另外，全市有十几所幼儿园。
