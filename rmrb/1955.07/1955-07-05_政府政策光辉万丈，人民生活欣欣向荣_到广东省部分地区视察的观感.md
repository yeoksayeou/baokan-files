Government Policies Shine Brilliantly, People's Lives Flourish
　　—Observations from an Inspection Trip to Parts of Guangdong Province
　　National People's Congress Representative Chen Rutang
　　After this trip to the countryside for inspection, I deeply feel that the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regarding the inspection of various regions by National People's Congress representatives is correct and wise. At the same time, I feel that such inspections are a good way for People's Representatives, as servants of the people, to perform their duties, and they are also social activities with rich content and significant political meaning. This is helpful for the implementation of the Constitution, laws, and national policies, beneficial to the improvement of one's political and ideological understanding, and greatly beneficial to the close connection between state organs and the people.

　　This time, I went to the countryside for inspection together with representatives Ye Duyi, Lin Qiangyun, Deng Wenzhao, Zhang Zhennan, and some representatives of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, as well as some standing committee members of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During this trip, we came into contact with many aspects and saw the work situation of rural workers, and only then did we realize how hard they work and that their hardworking and simple style is worthy of our learning. Among them, the vast majority are wholeheartedly serving the people and working tirelessly to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. This point was only clarified in our minds after the inspection. Now, let's take the tense grain situation as an example. Regarding the problem of the tense grain situation, some of our comrades, living in Guangzhou, felt unable to respond to the complaints of grain shortage and the problems with the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Some comrades, because they did not know what the current situation was in the countryside, felt doubtful about the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. When we set off to various places, we focused on inspecting the grain yield, purchase, and sale situation with a more concerned attitude, and investigated the problem of widespread grain shortage reflected in the countryside, and only then did we clarify the truth about the tense atmosphere created by the shouting of grain shortage.

　　The grain problem is mainly manifested in two "big" aspects: one is the large quantity of grain over-sold, and the other is the loud cries of grain shortage. According to the Guangdong Provincial Grain Bureau, from January to mid-April this year, the province's grain supply increased daily, with a large amount of over-sales. Some counties had already sold most or all of their sales quotas by this time, and some even exceeded their sales quotas. But the more they over-sold, the louder the shouts in the countryside. In mid-April, the government believed that the amount of over-sales was too large and needed to be controlled, so it slightly lowered the unified sales quota. At this time, the cadres could not figure out who had surplus grain and who lacked grain, so they had to distribute it evenly. In this way, it didn't matter much if the quota was generous, but if the quota was small, problems would arise, and the grain needed by grain-deficient households could not be guaranteed. But how many grain-deficient households are actually not getting grain supplies? Are those shouting for grain shortage truly grain-deficient households? According to our on-the-spot inspection, from the forums of various sectors and conversations with local people, we can understand that there are various situations of "shouting": some are genuine grain-deficient households shouting; some are surplus grain households shouting because they are afraid of selling surplus grain; and some grain households (those who are self-sufficient in grain) also shout along with others when they see people shouting. In addition, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements deliberately disrupt the grain policy and shout particularly loudly. On the surface, they are all "shouting", but as long as you go a little deeper to understand, in the Yuezhong area, most of those shouting are surplus grain households, a few are grain-deficient households, and counter-revolutionaries or bad elements are making a lot of noise. As for some genuine grain-deficient households, some are deficient because of habitual waste, and some are indeed short of rice because of fewer laborers and more people. I believe that the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is completely correct. The implementation of this policy plays an important role in promoting production, ensuring price stability, and ensuring the smooth progress of national construction, and is warmly supported by the broad masses of people. But we must also point out that, in addition to the fact that some areas suffered reduced production due to drought last autumn, and winter crops suffered serious crop failures due to frost and drought in winter, coupled with the severe drought during this year's spring plowing, farmers were afraid of a "grain shortage" and hoarded grain for famine prevention, making the grain situation tense. There are also some areas where shortcomings in work have created an artificial tense atmosphere. For example, in order to prevent waste, it was stipulated that the time for the masses to buy rice should be divided into three ten-day periods, requiring the masses to gather together on the same day to buy rice. In this way, an artificial tense atmosphere was formed, creating a tense mentality of "fearing that they would not be able to buy rice." This situation is extremely common in various places. After we made suggestions and the local authorities cancelled that regulation and changed their approach, the tense atmosphere immediately eased. In addition, unclear grain work and an unsound system, resulting in the failure to supply what should have been supplied, or the over-supply of what should have been less supplied or not supplied, is also a cause of the tense grain situation. Lianquan Township, Shajiao Village, Nanhai County, with a total of 250 households in the village, said that everyone did not have enough to eat after the supply certificates were issued; after investigating, it was discovered that seven households had less grain, and thirty-two households had more grain. Obviously, grain work needs to be strengthened in all aspects.

　　Now, both cities and villages are developing rapidly, the people's lives are significantly improving, and a prosperous scene is emerging. In Sansha Township (Shatian area), Xinhui County, 98 percent of the households in the entire township have surplus money deposited in credit cooperatives, with the smaller deposits being 290 yuan and the larger ones reaching 900 yuan. In Shawan Township, Zhongshan County, the masses used to generally have only two sets of clothes, but now most people have five or six sets of clothes, and they all have quilts and mosquito nets, some of which are new quilts and new mosquito nets. In that township, there used to be thirty young "sand boys" who could not get married because they had no money, but now there is only one bachelor left, and the others have all gotten married and are living happy family lives.

　　We can see very clearly that the gradual improvement of the lives of the broad masses of people is the result of the hard work of the working people, the hard work of the broad masses of cadres, and the guidance of the Party and the government's various policies. The brilliance of government policies shines on people's progress!

　　政府政策光辉万丈，人民生活欣欣向荣
　　——到广东省部分地区视察的观感
　　全国人民代表大会代表　陈汝棠
    经过这次下乡视察之后，我深深感到全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于全国人民代表到各地视察的决定是正确的，英明的；同时更觉得这样巡行视察，既是作为人民勤务员的人民代表履行职务的很好的工作方式，也是具有丰富的内容和重大的政治意义的社会活动。这对宪法、法律和国家政策的实施是有帮助的，对自己政治思想认识的提高是很有裨益的，对国家机关与人民群众的密切联系是大有好处的。
    我这次下乡视察，是同叶笃义、林锵云、邓文钊、张振南等代表和广东省第一届人民代表大会部分的代表及人民政协广东省委员会部分的常务委员一道去的。这次我们下去，接触了多方面，看了农村工作人员工作的情形，才了解到他们工作是多么辛苦的，他们艰苦朴实的作风是值得我们学习的；在他们之中，绝大多数是忠心耿耿地为人民服务的，为巩固人民民主专政而努力不懈。这点，是在视察之后，我们思想上才明确起来的。现在仅就粮食紧张情况来举例。对粮食情况紧张的问题，我们一些同志住在广州，对那种叫缺粮，说粮食统购统销政策有问题的反映，感到无言应对，有些同志由于不知道现在的农村究竟搞成怎么样了，对粮食统购统销政策感到疑惑起来。我们出发各地时，以较为关切的心情，对粮食的产量，收购和销售的情况着重加以视察，并对当前农村普遍反映缺粮的问题作了考究，才弄清了叫喊缺粮造成紧张空气的真相。
    粮食问题主要表现在两个“大”字上面，一是粮食超销数量大，二是缺粮喊声大。据广东省粮食厅反映，从今年一月至四月中旬，全省粮食供应日见增加，大量超销。有些县到这个时候大部或全部销售指标已经售完，甚至有的还超出了销售指标。但越是超销，农村里喊得越厉害。到了四月中旬，政府认为超销数量太多了，须要加以控制，把统销指标稍稍压低下来，这时干部又摸不清到底谁余粮、谁缺粮，只得平均分配下去。这样，指标宽的，还不大要紧，指标少的，当然就出了问题，不能保证供应缺粮户所需的粮食。但究竟有多少得不到粮食供应的缺粮户呢？叫缺粮的是不是真正缺粮户呢？据我们实地视察，从各界座谈会和同当地群众交谈当中，可以了解到有各种不同情况的“叫”：有的是真正缺粮户在叫；有的是余粮户因怕卖余粮而叫；也有些有粮户（粮食自给自足的），看见人家叫，自己也跟着叫；加上地主、富农、反革命分子及其他坏分子有意破坏粮食政策而故意大叫特叫。从表面上去看，他们都在“叫”，但只要深入一点去了解，在粤中区来说，叫的多数是余粮户，少数是缺粮户，反革命分子或坏分子闹的很凶；就一些真正的缺粮户来说，有些是习惯性的浪费造成了缺粮现象，有些是劳动力少、人口多，米粮的确不够。我认为国家的粮食统购统销政策是完全正确的，这一政策的实施，对促进生产、保证物价稳定和国家建设顺利进行是有重要作用的，是深受广大群众热烈拥护的。但我们也必须指出这点，即：除了有部分地区去年秋季因旱灾而减产，冬季又因冻灾、旱灾，冬耕作物严重失收；再加上今年春耕期间天气亢旱，农民恐怕发生“粮荒”，纷纷囤粮备荒，使粮食情况趋于紧张。还有些地区在工作中有缺点，也造成了人为的紧张空气。如为了防止浪费，规定群众买米时间分为三旬，要群众同一天聚在一起去买米。这样，便形成了人为的紧张空气，造成了“恐怕买不到米”的紧张心理。这种情况各地极普遍，经我们提出建议，当地取消那种规定、改变了做法之后，紧张空气就立即和缓下来。此外，粮食工作摸底不清，制度不够健全，致使该供应的未供应、应少供应或不必供应的多供应了，也是促使粮食情况紧张的一种原因。南海县联?乡沙?村，全村二百五十户，发了供应证以后，人人都说不够吃；经过摸底，才发现有七户的粮食是少了，有三十二户粮食是多了。显然，粮食工作是要从各方面予以加强的。
    现在，城市和乡村都日新月异地发展着，人民生活显著地改善着，呈现着欣欣向荣的景象。新会县三沙乡（沙田地区）全乡有百分之九十八的户口有余钱存入信用合作社，少的存二百九十元，多的达九百元。中山县沙望乡群众过去普遍只有两套衣服，但现在多数人已有五、六套衣服，并且都有了被帐，有些还是新被新帐。那个乡，过去有三十个青年“沙仔”没有钱不能结婚，现在只还有一个单身汉，其他都结了婚，过着幸福的家庭生活。
    我们看得很清楚，广大人民生活的逐步改善，是劳动人民努力生产得来的，是广大干部辛勤工作得来的，是党和政府各项政策指引下获得的。政府政策的光辉照耀着人们前进！
