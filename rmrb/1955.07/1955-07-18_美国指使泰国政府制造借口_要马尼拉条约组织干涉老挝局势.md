Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: Bangkok dispatch: At a press conference held by Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram on the 15th, Thai Foreign Minister Narathip said that the Thai government has requested the Manila Treaty Organization to "study the situation in Laos." Pibul also announced that he had ordered the Thai army to "make preparations."

    At this press conference, Thai Police Director-General and Deputy Minister of Interior Nai Phao Sriyanond described the military offensive by the Royal Lao Army against the Pathet Lao fighting forces as an attack by Laos, attempting to create a pretext for the Manila Treaty Organization to intervene in the Lao situation.

    The Thai government's clamor for the Manila Treaty Organization to intervene in the Lao situation this time is considered to be instigated and supported by the United States. A Reuters dispatch from Washington pointed out that US State Department officials immediately expressed that the United States did not object to the suggestion of the Manila Treaty Organization "considering" the Lao situation after Pibul held the press conference. They also tried their best to defend Thailand's proposal to undermine the Geneva Accords.

    美国指使泰国政府制造借口
    要马尼拉条约组织干涉老挝局势
    新华社河内十七日电　曼谷消息：在泰国总理銮披汶十五日举行的记者招待会上，泰国外交部长那拉底说，泰国政府已经要求马尼拉条约组织“研究老挝局势”。銮披汶并且宣布，他已经命令泰国陆军“进行准备”。
    泰国警察总监和内政部副部长乃炮·是耶暖在这个记者招待会上把老挝王国军队对寮国战斗部队进行军事进攻的事实说成是寮国进行攻击，企图为马尼拉条约组织干涉老挝局势制造借口。
    泰国政府这次出面要求马尼拉条约组织干涉老挝局势的叫嚣，被认为是由美国指使和支持的。路透社华盛顿的消息指出，美国国务院官员在銮披汶举行记者招待会之后就立即表示美国不反对由马尼拉条约组织来“考虑”老挝局势的建议，他们并且竭力为泰国的这一破坏日内瓦协定的建议进行辩护。
