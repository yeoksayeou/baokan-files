The United States Intensifies Preparations for War

    U.S. Congress Passes Bill to Continue Expanding Arms Race
    The U.S. Congress finally passed the U.S. government's military spending bill for the 1956 fiscal year on June 30. This bill allocates more than $31.8 billion to the U.S. Department of Defense and the three services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) in the 1956 fiscal year to continue expanding the arms race. This appropriation is approximately $3 billion more than the appropriation for the 1955 fiscal year.
    On June 28, the House of Representatives also passed a bill extending the U.S. government's current conscription law for four years.
    On June 27, the House of Representatives also passed a bill agreeing to allocate more than $2.36 billion to build a large number of military bases in the U.S. mainland and overseas.
    Formulating a "Long-Term Plan" to Invade Taiwan
    According to a report by United Press International correspondent Miller in Taipei on June 25, the United States has formulated a "long-term plan" aimed at making Taiwan a military base for the United States to oppose the Chinese people.
    Miller said that according to the U.S. "long-term plan," the U.S. Seventh Fleet will continue to perform the task of obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan "for years to come." At the same time, the United States will use at least $300 million annually to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, of which $200 million will be direct military aid and $100 million will be economic aid.
    The U.S. plan also stipulates that the number of officers and soldiers in the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan will soon increase to 1,700. It will send U.S. officers to the lowest-level units of the Chiang bandit army to supervise training and re-equipment work. The current U.S. goal of arming the Chiang bandit army is: to maintain the twenty-three regular army divisions of the Chiang bandit army at full strength and in "high combat conditions," and to provide assistance to the Chiang bandit army's Marine Corps; to establish a Chiang bandit air force with eight regiments of jet fighters and fighter-bombers; in terms of the navy, to provide the Chiang bandit navy with two more destroyers and several landing craft and patrol boats in the near future.
    Miller also quoted "American sources" as saying that if the Chinese people liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan occupied by the Chiang bandit army, it will be "necessary to greatly increase American aid."
    The United States Intensifies Training of South Vietnamese Troops
    The United States is stepping up the training of South Vietnamese troops. According to a report by Associated Press correspondent in Saigon on June 22, three hundred South Vietnamese officers and soldiers will soon depart for the United States, South Korea, Hawaii, and the Philippines for specialized training. The head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in South Vietnam, O'Daniel, is also preparing to host training classes to instill command knowledge to all officers above the rank of second lieutenant. The training classes will begin in mid-July.
    The Associated Press reporter also pointed out that O'Daniel's goal is to "rectify" the various components of the South Vietnamese army by the end of September, and then begin to organize them into "efficient and strong divisions" before December 31. This shows that the United States is planning to further eliminate pro-French forces in the South Vietnamese army and cultivate this army as a tool of the United States.
    A Large Amount of Weapons Will Be Supplied to Japan This Year
    On June 21, Takeso Shimoda, director of the Treaty Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives that the Japanese government, based on the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," has planned to accept various weapons worth 100 million U.S. dollars supplied by the United States to the Japanese army in the U.S. 1956 fiscal year starting in July.
    Shimoda also said that if the weapons supplied by the United States to the Japanese Navy and Air Force are added, the number is quite large.
    The United States and Japan will begin negotiations on the transfer of these weapons in August.
    Expanding Military Bases on Okinawa Island
    Kyodo News Agency reported on the 19th that the United States' expansion of military bases on Okinawa Island has driven the lives of the islanders into desperation.
    Kyodo News Agency said: The entire island of Okinawa is gradually being transformed into a military base under the control of the U.S. military. As of 1954, the military land occupied by the U.S. military on Okinawa Island accounted for about 14 percent of the island's total area, and the requisitioned cultivated land has reached 22.69 percent of the total cultivated land area. Before the war, each farming household on the island owned an average of 6.6 ping of cultivated land (one ping is about 3.3 square meters), which was reduced to 4.4 ping after the war. Now, in order to build Okinawa into a permanent military base, the U.S. military authorities are also requesting Congress to allocate funds in order to obtain long-term usage rights for 52,000 acres of land (an increase of 30 percent over the currently requisitioned land area).
    The U.S. military only pays a very small amount of symbolic rent for the requisitioned land of farmers. As a result, the lives of residents, especially farmers, are becoming increasingly impoverished. Coupled with the increasing expansion of military land, there is no other way but to starve to death. Recently, thirty-two farmers whose land had been requisitioned risked returning to their own land to cultivate because they had no means of living. They were arrested by the U.S. military and sentenced to three months of hard labor. U.S. officials also threatened the Okinawa "Legislature" not to conduct on-site investigations into this incident, otherwise they would "recommend dissolving the Legislature."
    Kyodo News Agency said: Local residents have launched a fierce movement against the U.S. land requisition.
    North Atlantic Group Holds Air Force Exercises
    TASS London: According to London Radio, the air forces of the countries participating in the North Atlantic Group began exercises on the 20th. This exercise will last for eight days and is the largest exercise conducted so far. More than 3,000 aircraft from eleven participating countries of the North Atlantic Group participated in the exercise, mainly aircraft from the United States and the United Kingdom in West Germany and other countries. Atomic weapons will be used to conduct "attacks" during the exercise.

　　美国加紧备战活动
    美国会通过继续扩军备战法案
    美国国会六月三十日最后通过了美国政府提出的一九五六财政年度的军费法案。这个法案规定在一九五六财政年度拨出三百一十八亿余美元给美国国防部和海陆空三军，以便继续进行扩军备战。这笔拨款比一九五五财政年度的拨款约多三十亿美元。
    在六月二十八日，众议院还通过了把美国政府目前的征兵法延长四年的法案。
    众议院在六月二十七日还通过了一个同意拨出二十三亿六千多万美元在美国本土和海外大量建筑军事基地的法案。
    制定侵占台湾的“长远计划”
    据合众社驻台北记者米勒二十五日透露，美国已经制定了一个“长远计划”，目的在于使台湾成为美国用来反对中国人民的军事基地。
    米勒说，根据美国的“长远计划”，美国第七舰队将在“今后的岁月中”继续担任阻挠中国人民解放台湾的任务。同时，美国每年将至少用三亿美元来支持蒋介石卖国集团，其中两亿美元是直接军事援助，一亿美元是经济援助。
    美国的计划还规定，美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团的官兵不久将增加到一千七百名。它将把美国军官派到蒋贼军最低层的部队里去监督训练和重新装备的工作。美国目前武装蒋贼军的目标是：使蒋贼军的二十三个正规陆军师保持满员和“高度的战斗条件”，并且给蒋贼军海军陆战队以援助；建立一支有八个联队喷气战斗机和战斗轰炸机的蒋贼空军；在海军方面，在最近的将来再给蒋贼海军两艘驱逐舰和若干登陆艇及巡逻艇。
      米勒还引“美国人士”的话说，如果中国人民解放蒋贼军盘踞下的沿海岛屿和台湾，就“有必要大大增加美援”。
    美国加紧训练南越军队
    美国正在加紧训练南越军队。据美联社驻西贡记者二十二日报道，有三百名南越军官和士兵不久将动身到美国、南朝鲜、夏威夷和菲律宾去受专门训练。美国驻南越军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔也准备主持训练班，给所有少尉以上的军官灌输指挥知识，训练班将在七月中开始。
    美联社记者并且指出，奥丹尼尔的目标是在九月底以前“整顿”南越军队的各种成分，而后在十二月三十一日前开始把它们组织成为“有效率的坚强的师团”。这说明美国正计划进一步清除南越军队中的亲法势力，把这支军队培植为美国的工具。
    今
      年度将供给日本大量武器
    日本外务省条约局长下田武三于二十一日在众议院外务委员会上说，日本政府根据美日“共同防御援助协定”，已经计划在从七月开始的美国一九五六会计年度内，接受美国供给日本陆军的价值一亿美元的各种武器。
    下田武三还说，如果再加上美国供给日本海军和空军的武器，那数目是相当大的。
    美日双方将在八月份开始举行关于授受这些武器的谈判。
    在冲绳岛扩建军事基地
    共同社十九日报道美国在冲绳岛扩建军事基地的备战活动使岛民生活陷入绝境。
    共同社说：冲绳全岛在美军控制下正一步步地军事基地化。截至一九五四年为止，美军在冲绳岛占用的军事土地约占全岛面积的百分之十四，征用耕地已达全部耕地面积的百分之二十二点六九。战前岛上每一农户平均拥有耕地六点六坪（一坪约合三点三平方公尺），战后减少到四点四坪。现在，美国军事当局为了把冲绳建设为永久性军事基地，还正在要求国会拨款，以便取得五万二千英亩土地
  （比现在征用的土地面积增加百分之三十）的长期使用权。
    美军征用农民土地只出极少的一点象征性租费，这样一来，居民，特别是农民，生活愈来愈穷困，再加上军用土地日益扩大，除了饿死以外没有别的路。最近，曾有土地被征用的三十二个农民，因生活无着冒险回到自己的土地上耕作，竟被美军逮捕，并被判处三个月的苦役。美国官员还威胁冲绳“立法院”不得对这个事件进行实地调查，否则就要“建议解散立法院”。
    共同社说：当地居民已经展开了猛烈的反对美国征用土地的运动。
  北大西洋集团
    举行空军演习
    塔斯社伦敦讯：据伦敦电台报道，北大西洋集团参加国的空军二十日开始演习。这次演习要进行八天，是直到现在为止所进行的演习中最大的一次。参加这次演习的有北大西洋集团十一个参加国的三千多架飞机，主要是美国和英国在西德和其他国家领土上的飞机。在演习的时候将使用原子武器进行“攻击”。
