　　After the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement that began in the winter of 1950, some people believed that there were "no more" counter-revolutionaries, and thus became 麻痹, losing their revolutionary vigilance in the face of increasingly sharp and complex class struggles. People who have this understanding, please take a look at the following facts!
　　From November 1954 to January 1955, the Public Security organs of Shaanxi Province cracked a counter-revolutionary organization "Zhongdao" case in the Weinan and Shangluo areas. This counter-revolutionary organization developed after the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and ban reactionary secret societies. It involved nine counties in two special districts, with more than 3,000 leaders and followers. In the case alone, more than 400 leaders were arrested. Some of these leaders were counter-revolutionary recidivists who had been released after serving their sentences, had been released from control, or were currently under control; some were counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary leaders who had escaped during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the banning of reactionary secret societies; and some were illegal landlords, reactionary rich peasants, and die-hard enemy and puppet personnel.
　　The activities of these leaders were extremely secretive. Some major leaders hid for a long time in caves, secret rooms, deep mountains, and wild caves, and often changed their addresses. They usually did not come forward, and the "connecting" and "liaison" were carried out by instructing lower-level leaders. They also often educated the lower levels to "those who know do not speak, and those who do not know do not ask." After joining the sect, they first made a "vow of silence," not to spread rumors to the outside world, to prevent "leaking secrets." There were more than 100 caves, secret rooms, secret buildings, sandwich walls, and tunnels where these leaders often hid. Twenty-eight major leaders were captured from these caves and secret rooms, and various counter-revolutionary documents, weapons and ammunition, Kuomintang flags, and other evidences were seized.
　　"Zhongdao" was originally Yiguandao. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the banning of reactionary secret societies, Yiguandao became notorious, and deceived followers withdrew from the sect one after another. In order to deceive the masses and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, reactionary leaders used the new name of "Zhongdao" to deceive Yiguandao members who had already withdrawn from the sect to join again. According to investigations after the case was cracked, most members of this counter-revolutionary organization were those who had withdrawn from Yiguandao and were then tricked into joining "Zhongdao."
　　The destructive methods of this counter-revolutionary organization were extremely insidious and vicious. They sabotaged the policies of the Communist Party and the central tasks of the rural areas. In the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, they fabricated rumors and slanders, saying things like:
　　"Joining the mutual aid group is like entering ‘hell,’ with no freedom; joining ‘Zhongdao’ is like going to ‘heaven.’" "If you join the agricultural cooperative, livestock, farm tools, and trees will all become public property." They also spread rumors saying: "A man takes several women to the fields, this is a time when ten villages have no smoke, and nine women are matched to one man!" Many people, because they mistakenly believed the rumors, slaughtered and sold large numbers of livestock, cut down trees indiscriminately, and dared not join groups or cooperatives. Fan Zhenhai, the leader of the mutual aid group in Nantancun, District 11, Weinan County, worked actively, and the leader Li Xiangdao said to him: "What are you doing to make the mutual aid group better, you might as well eat better, go out more, and do less!" Last winter, rumors were discovered in the fourth township of this district that "after joining the cooperative, the cattle will become public property" and "trees will be purchased and become public property." The investigation revealed that these rumors were also fabricated by the leader Li Xiangdao. These leaders wanted to use these rumors to prevent farmers from taking the socialist road to common prosperity.
　　In addition to fabricating rumors and slanders, these leaders also tried to infiltrate the internal structures of mutual aid and cooperative organizations to carry out sabotage. According to preliminary statistics from Luonan County alone, 34 of the arrested leaders had infiltrated mutual aid groups, and six had seized the positions of mutual aid group leaders. Some also organized fake mutual aid groups. The regulations of the fake mutual aid group headed by Ji Wuchen, the leader of Guanzi Chi Village, Dali County, were: not to absorb Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists into the group, but to specifically absorb backward elements and those who were dissatisfied with the government.
　　As soon as the unified purchase and sale of grain and oil began, the major leader Wei Yinglin instructed the middle and lower-level leaders to refuse to sell surplus grain, and at the same time issued "altar instructions" saying that a "famine robbery" was imminent, instructing the middle and lower-level leaders to hoard and snap up large quantities of goods. During the cracking of the case, large quantities of hoarded grain were dug out from the caves and secret rooms of these counter-revolutionary elements. From the home of Wang Jiaxing (landlord), the leader of Dali County, alone, about 40 or more *shi* of hoarded grain were found; more than 500 *jin* of snatched pure oil and kerosene were found in the caves and secret rooms of three nest owners. As soon as the planned supply of cotton cloth began, the major leader instructed the middle and lower-level leaders to snatch up large quantities of cloth in Xi'an and other places. They also spread rumors that table salt would also be subject to unified purchase. Upon hearing this rumor, the masses of Shangguanfang Village, District 7, Shang County, left their work in the fields and ran 70 to 80 *li* to the city to buy more than 900 *jin* of table salt.
　　These counter-revolutionary elements also tried every means to infiltrate our internal organs to carry out various sabotage activities, and even tried to develop organizations within us. Pan Xikun, a leader who infiltrated the District Office of District 5 of Dali County as a statistician, reported to the major leader Cheng Ziyu about the situation that our Public Security Bureau had sent people to the district to investigate and verify the criminal materials of the "Zhongdao" case, and asked Cheng Ziyu to "be careful." Xu Jiasheng, a leader who infiltrated Xiaozhai Village Primary School in District 4 of Dali County as a teacher, often contacted Li Xiangdao, the major leader of Weinan County, to spread rumors. The major leader Cheng Ziyu even attempted to win over the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee of District 5 of Dali County (brother of Pan Shixiong) through the leader Pan Shixiong, but failed.
　　The incidents of these evil leaders defrauding the masses of money and harming young children were also very serious. They often defrauded the masses of property in the name of "merit fees," "fate settlement fees," and "vow settlement fees," causing many backward people to be deceived and lose the money they earned through labor for nothing; some sold their beloved livestock and farm tools to pay "sect fees." On the "sect account" of Qian Linhan, the leader seized in Dali County, the income in 1954 alone was more than 3,600 yuan in RMB, 188 silver dollars, and a large number of gold and silver jewelry, silk and velvet, etc. These properties were used as capital for counter-revolutionary activities or squandered by a few leaders. Many young children were tricked into caves and secret rooms to "study planchette writing," and often suffered beatings and insults, even to the point of death. When Chen Dier, a female sect member from Huayin County, was 19 years old, she was tricked into a cave by Guo Zhiying and others to "study planchette writing" and was abused. When Chen Dier realized that she had been deceived and wanted to escape home, she was forcibly stopped by Guo and others, and as a result, she was forced to death in the cave. There were four boys and girls who were killed in this way in Weinan, Huayin and other places.
　　What is the purpose of these evil leaders carrying out these criminal activities? The following facts can clearly answer this question. They are plotting "rebellion" and attempting to subvert the people's regime! In June 1954, the major leader Wei Yinglin claimed to be "Mao Tian院长下凡" at the home of Li Changsheng, the nest owner of Liuzhi Station in Hua County, and "conferred official positions" on the major leaders around him. His son, Wei Fulu, was appointed as "院长三太子兼执令官", Li Changsheng was appointed as "辅佐掌门官", and also appointed "Generals," "Vanguards," "Marshals," and "Township Marquis," etc., and issued instructions to connect middle and lower-level leaders in various places and develop followers. When the People's Government arrested these criminals, some people still had the so-called instructions issued by Wei on them. The leader Zhou Shengwa and others also buried four rifles in preparation for riots.
　　No matter how cunning, treacherous, insidious, and vicious the enemy is, they can never escape the giant palm of the people. In the process of cracking this counter-revolutionary organization, the people's public security organs received active support and assistance from the broad masses of the people. The public security organs had received many clues from the masses about the counter-revolutionary activities of "Zhongdao" before the case was cracked. During the cracking of the case, many people assisted the public security personnel in capturing bandits. The militia of Gangzichuan, Hua County, automatically organized a search team, searched caves, and captured a leader. When escorting the reactionary leaders, more than 100 farmers in Hongshan Village, Dali County, automatically repaired and widened the road to facilitate the passage of the vehicles escorting the criminals. Some deceived followers, after the case was cracked and after education, woke up and actively participated in this struggle. For example, Li Genjiu, a deceived follower from Hua County, reported two leaders hiding in his home when registering with the government, and also led public security personnel to capture a leader in a cave who almost escaped. The "Zhongdao" case, which had been carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in Weinan, Shaanxi Province, and other places for several years, has been completely cracked, and those stubborn leaders have been captured one after another. The People's Government will severely punish them according to their crimes.

　　反革命组织“中道”在渭南等地的罪恶活动
　　高恩
    经过一九五○年冬季开始的大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动以后，有些人认为反革命已经“没有什么了”，因而麻痹起来，在日趋尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争面前失去了革命警惕。有这种认识的人，请看看下边的事实吧！
    陕西省公安机关在一九五四年十一月到一九五五年一月，在渭南、商雒地区破获了一个反革命组织“中道”案。这个反革命组织是镇压反革命和取缔反动会道门运动以后才发展起来的。它涉及到两个专区的九个县，道首、道徒达三千多人，仅就破案中逮捕的道首就有四百多名。这些道首有一部分是经过判刑期满释放、已经解除管制和现被管制的反革命重犯；一部分是镇压反革命和取缔反动会道门运动中漏网的反革命分子和反动道首；还有一部分是不法地主、反动富农和坚持反动立场的敌伪人员。
    这些道首的活动是极其诡秘的。有些大道首长期藏匿在地洞、暗室、深山、野洞里，并且经常变换住址。他们平常不出头露面，“接线”和“联络”都是指使下层道首进行。他们还经常教育下层“知者不言，不知者不问”。入了道以后先立“封口愿”，不准向外传说，防止“泄露秘密”。这些道首经常藏匿的地洞、暗室、暗楼、夹墙、坑道，有一百多处。从这些地洞、暗室中捕获的主要道首就有二十八名，并搜出各种反动文件、武器弹药、国民党旗等罪证。
    “中道”原来就是一贯道。经过镇压反革命和取缔反动会道门运动以后，一贯道臭名远扬，受骗道徒纷纷退道。反动道首为了欺骗群众，继续进行反革命活动，就以“中道”的新名目欺骗已经退道的一贯道分子二次上网。据破案后查明，这个反革命组织的大多数分子是退出一贯道以后又被骗进了“中道”的。
    这个反革命组织的破坏手段极其阴险恶毒。他们破坏共产党的政策，破坏农村的各项中心工作。在农业互助合作运动中，他们造谣诬蔑，说什么
  “入了互助组就像入了‘地狱’，不得自由，入了
  ‘中道’就等于上了‘天堂’。”“入了农业社，牲畜、农具、树木都要归公。”他们又造谣说：“一个男人带上几个女人下地，这是十村九无烟，九女配一男的时候到了！”不少群众就因为误信了谣言，大量宰杀和出卖牲畜，滥伐树木，不敢入组入社。渭南县十一区南滩村互助组长樊振海工作积极，道首李向道便对他说：“你把互助组搞好是为了什么呀，还不如吃好些，多逛些，少做些！”这个区第四乡去年冬天发现“入了社以后牛要归公”、
  “树木要统购、要归公”的谣言，追查结果也是道首李向道布置小道首编造的。这些道首就想用这种谣言来阻碍农民走大家富裕的社会主义道路。
    除了造谣诬蔑以外，这些道首还力图钻入互助合作组织内部进行破坏。仅据雒南县初步统计，被捕道首中就有三十四名混入了互助组，并有六名窃取了互助组长的职务。有的还组织假互助组。大荔县管子池村以道首季戊辰为首的假互助组的规章是：不吸收共产党员和青年团员、积极分子入组，专门吸收落后的和对政府不满的分子。
    粮食、油料统购统销一开始，大道首魏映林就一面布置中、小道首拒绝出售余粮，一面又发出“坛训”说“饥馑劫”临头，布置中、小道首大量囤积、抢购。在破案时，各地都从这些反革命分子的地洞、暗室中挖出大批囤积的粮食，仅从大荔县道首王甲兴（地主）家中即查出囤积的粮食约四十多石；从三个窝主家中的地洞、暗室内查出抢购的清油、煤油五百多斤。棉布计划供应一开始，大道首指使中、小道首在西安等地抢购了大量布匹。他们还造谣说食盐也要统购。商县七区上官坊村群众听到这个谣言，就丢下地里的活，跑了七、八十里山路到城里买了九百多斤食盐。
    这些反革命分子还想尽办法钻入我机关内部进行各种破坏活动，甚至还力图在我内部发展组织。混入大荔县五区区公所当统计员的道首潘西坤，把我公安局派人到该区查证“中道”案罪恶材料的情况报告给大道首程子玉，并要程子玉“小心点”。混入大荔县第四区小寨村小学任教员的道首徐家升，经常和渭南县大道首李向道取得联系，散布谣言。大道首程子玉竟企图通过道首潘世雄拉拢我大荔县第五区区委副书记（潘世雄之兄）入道，未能得逞。
    这些万恶的道首诈骗群众钱财、残害少年儿童的事件也是十分严重的。他们常用什么“功德费”、
  “了缘费”、“了愿费”等名义诈骗群众财物，使不少落后群众上了当，把自己劳动换来的钱财白白送掉；有的为交“道费”，把自己珍爱的牲畜、农具变卖。在大荔县查获的道首骞林汉的“道账”上，仅一九五四年就收入人民币三千六百多元，银元一百八十八块，以及大批金银首饰、绸缎毛绒等。这些财物都是被用作反革命活动的资本，或者被少数道首挥霍了。许多少年儿童被他们骗入地洞、暗室“学习扶乩”，并常常遭受毒打凌辱，甚至因此致死。华阴县女道徒陈弟儿在十九岁时，被道首郭志英等骗入地洞“学习扶乩”，受到糟蹋。陈弟儿知道受了骗，想逃出回家时，被郭犯等强行制止，结果被逼死在地洞里。像这样被害死的男女孩子，在渭南、华阴等地就有四个。
    万恶的道首进行这些罪恶活动的目的是什么呢？下边的事实可以清楚地回答这个问题。他们是阴谋“造反”，企图颠覆人民政权！一九五四年六月间，大道首魏映林在华县柳枝车站窝主李长胜家自称是“茂田院长下凡”，对其周围的大道首“封官委将”。封其子魏福禄为“院长三太子兼执令官”，李长胜为“辅佐掌门官”，还封什么“将军”、“先锋”、“元帅”、“镇守侯”等，并各发指令，分派到各地连络中、小道首，发展道徒。直到人民政府逮捕这些罪犯时，有些人身上还装着魏犯发给他们的所谓指令。道首周升娃等，还埋藏了长枪四支，准备暴乱。
    任凭敌人是如何狡猾诡诈、阴险毒辣，总是逃不出人民的巨掌的。人民公安机关在破获这个反革命组织过程中，受到广大群众的积极支持和协助。公安机关在破案前曾经得到不少群众对“中道”反革命活动的检举线索。在破案期间，有许多群众协助公安人员捕捉匪徒。华县港子川的民兵自动组织起搜查队，搜查山洞，捕获了一名道首。在押解反动道首时，大荔县洪善村有一百多名农民自动把道路修平加宽，以便押解罪犯的汽车通行。有些被骗的道徒，在破案并经过教育之后，觉悟过来，也积极参加了这一斗争。如华县被骗的道徒李根九，就在向政府登记时检举了藏匿在他家的两名道首，又带领公安人员在山洞里捕捉到一个险些漏网的道首。在陕西省渭南等地进行反革命活动数年之久的“中道”案，已经全部破获，那些冥顽的道首，都纷纷就擒。人民政府将按照他们的罪行，给以严厉的惩处。
