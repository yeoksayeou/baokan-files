Xinhua News Agency, July 13th. The more than 2,800 textile exhibits from China that will be participating in international expositions to be held soon in countries such as Bulgaria, Indonesia, Syria, and Pakistan are currently being shipped to those respective countries.

　　The exhibits collected for this overseas exhibition are richer in variety and of significantly improved quality compared to those sent to any previous exhibitions, thanks to improvements in production. The silk exhibits highlight various precious and exquisite light gauze and thin silks, brocade satin with ancient and elegant patterns, and tussah silk that is popular among the people of Southeast Asia. Among them are newly trial-produced varieties such as Pearl Crepe, Black and White Crepe, Jade Ring Crepe, and Floral Light Twill. The cotton fabrics feature novel patterns of various poplins, lawns, bubble cloths, checkered fabrics, Shanghai gauze, and youth gauze, many of which are the latest products not yet available on the domestic market. In addition to pure wool flannels, the woolen fabrics newly include striped tweed, valitin, and women's wear flannel made from wool blended with ramie, tussah silk, and rayon, all of which have been successfully trial-woven. This represents a new technical achievement in China's textile industry in its search for substitutes. There are many types of embroidery exhibits. The Hunan embroidery screens "Doves Playing with Peonies" and "Bamboo Forest Peacocks" are both exquisitely embroidered. The Suzhou embroidery "Peonies and Wealth" screen, recently created by an old artist in his seventies, also represents new technical achievements. Other embroidered items include Suzhou embroidery hanging screens, bed blankets, quilt covers, table blankets, cushions, pillowcases, and nearly one hundred other types of embroidery, all of which fully demonstrate the special characteristics of Chinese national art.

    我参加四个国际博览会的纺织展览品启运
    新华社十三日讯  我国参加即将在保加利亚、印度尼西亚、叙利亚和巴基斯坦等国家举行的国际博览会的二千八百多种纺织展品，目前正分别运往各国。
    这次所征集的出国展览品，由于生产的改进，比参加过去任何一次展览会的品种都要丰富，质量也有很大提高。丝绸展品以各种名贵的、绮丽的轻纱薄绸，花纹古雅的织锦缎和为东南亚人民喜爱的柞绸为重点，其中有最近试制成功的珍珠绉、黑白绉、玉环绉，花光绮等新品种。棉布中各种府绸、麻纱、泡泡纱、格子布、上海罗、青年罗等花色都很新颖，其中许多是还没有在国内市场上出现的最新产品。毛织品中除纯毛呢绒外，新增加了最近试织成功的羊毛与红野麻、柞丝及人造纤维混纺的条花呢、凡立丁、女式呢等。这是我国纺织工业在寻求代用品方面新的技术成就。刺绣展品种类很多，湘绣“群鸽戏牡丹”和“竹林孔雀”屏风，绣工都非常精致。苏州七十多岁的老艺人最近所作刻丝“牡丹富贵”插屏，在技术上也有新的成就。其他还有苏绣挂屏、床毯、被面、台毯、靠垫、枕套等刺绣品将近一百种，也都充分地发扬了我国民族艺术的特长。
