Strengthen Ideological Armament
    Guo Lanying

    As a soldier of a New China's literary and art troupe, I am honored and happy. The Party educated me, cultivated me, armed me, taught me how to live, how to work, how to recognize enemies and friends, and how to fight against enemies.

    When the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed and the Hu Feng clique's mad attack was completely crushed, we rejoiced for the great victory that the Party achieved on the ideological and literary and art fronts. But I myself felt very ashamed; looking back, I have worked diligently and studied hard, but as a people's literary and art fighter and a people's representative, it is not enough to only do this. We should also have a high level of ideological understanding and political vigilance. I lacked vigilance against political enemies and ideological enemies in my daily life and work. Today, through this acute class struggle, the Party has once again reminded me, forcing me to rethink some issues. I am engaged in new opera work, and in many issues of new opera, some ideological differences, contradictions, and struggles have been manifested. However, we did not raise many so-called "technical" issues—vocal music, performance, etc.—to the level of literary and artistic thought to consider and understand. Therefore, some deviations occurred in artistic practice, forming an unhealthy tendency.

    The young new opera undertaking is complex and arduous, and the task that the Party gives to every member engaged in this business is also heavy and glorious; however, we—especially I personally—lack sufficient understanding of this task and lack a high sense of responsibility. Aren't these opportunities for the enemy to take advantage of? Therefore, today we must be vigilant, re-study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," rectify our thoughts and ranks, and consolidate our positions.

    Truly arm ourselves, thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and prevent the erosion of bourgeois literary and artistic thought.

    加强思想武装
    郭兰英
    作为一个新中国的文艺兵团的战士是光荣和幸福的。党教育我，培养了我，武装了我，教我怎样生活，怎样工作，怎样认清敌友，怎样同敌人斗争。
    当胡风反革命集团被揭发、胡风集团疯狂的进攻被彻底粉碎了的时候，我们为党在思想战线和文艺战线上取得的伟大的胜利而庆幸着。但我自己感到很惭愧；我回想一下，我是勤勤恳恳地工作过，也努力地学习过，但是，作为一个人民的文艺战士和人民的代表来要求，仅仅做到这一点是不够的，还应该有高度的思想水平和政治警惕性。而在日常生活和工作中对政治上的敌人和思想上的敌人是缺乏戒备的。今天，通过这次尖锐的阶级斗争，党再一次地提醒我，使我不能不重新去思考一些问题。我是从事新歌剧工作的，在新歌剧的许多问题上表现出某些思想上的分歧、矛盾和斗争。但是，我们没有把许多所谓“技术性”问题——声乐、表演等问题提到文艺思想上来考虑，来认识，因此，在艺术实践中产生某些偏差，形成一种不健康的倾向。
    年青的新歌剧事业是复杂而艰巨的，党给每一个从事这一业务的成员的任务也是繁重而光荣的；但是，我们——尤其是我个人却对这个任务缺乏足够的认识，缺乏高度的责任感。这些不正是敌人可乘之机吗？所以，今天必须警惕起来，重新学习毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，整顿我们的思想和队伍，巩固我们的阵地。
    把自己真正地武装起来，彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，并防止资产阶级文艺思想的侵蚀。
