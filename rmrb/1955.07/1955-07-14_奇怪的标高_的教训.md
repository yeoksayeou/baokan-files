Lessons of the "Strange Elevation"
By our correspondents Tian Liu and Gu Ye

From May 21st to June 8th, Shanxi Province held its Third Party Congress. The congress decided to launch a comprehensive campaign of conservation and anti-waste throughout the province, in order to better fulfill the arduous and glorious tasks assigned to Shanxi Province by the state's First Five-Year Plan. The congress believed that to carry out a comprehensive campaign of conservation and anti-waste, we must first pay attention to eliminating the serious waste phenomenon in industrial capital construction, because if this work is not done well, the losses and waste it causes to the country will far exceed the losses that other aspects can cause to the country.

The painful lesson of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, which violated the basic construction procedures, wasted and stockpiled more than 15 million yuan of state funds, and delayed the completion date by two and a half years, aroused the attention of the representatives.

The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant began construction in 1951. Due to neglecting the leading role of the Party and failing to comply with basic construction procedures; not paying attention to the collection of original design data, and not paying attention to surveying and mapping; not determining the production program in a timely manner; designing without product drawings; and blindly constructing without overall design, this new factory embarked on a wrong path from the beginning, causing many irreparable losses. Take the "strange elevation" as an example, it has caused very serious losses to our country. In the early stage of the plant construction in 1951, the technical personnel in charge of plant construction, Zhi Bingyuan and others, came to Taiyuan. They saw that the future factory was to be built on a sloping land and felt that it would hinder the smooth operation of trains in various workshops. Therefore, regardless of the characteristics of the groundwater, it was decided that all workshops should be built at the same level of 803.7 meters above sea level.

At that time, the plant construction staff, because of their lack of experience, technical knowledge, and understanding of the complexity of basic construction, coupled with the blind advance and eagerness for quick success, blindly trusted Zhi Bingyuan's ability and experience. Not only did they fail to firmly rely on the guidance and help of Soviet experts, but they also rashly agreed to Zhi Bingyuan's erroneous decision and carried out this vast project that destroyed the natural geology. After digging and filling more than 170,000 cubic meters of soil, the central area of the factory was flat, but the foundation was severely damaged. When the workers erected the tall steel frames of the steel casting workshop with thousands of tons of steel, they found that the groundwater level had risen after several meters of topsoil had been removed. If open-hearth furnaces were still installed here, its foundation would be more than three meters soaked in water. Everyone knows that if any part of the open-hearth furnace foundation is contaminated with a drop of water, it will cause an explosion. How can a foundation of more than three meters be soaked in water? There was no way but to suspend the construction of the nearly completed factory and send people all over the country to seek a waterproof solution for the open-hearth furnace foundation. The steel casting workshop had a groundwater problem, what about the groundwater situation in other workshops? People began to have doubts, and many projects were suspended one after another. The vigorous construction site turned into a lifeless and unmanageable mess in a blink of an eye. There was a lot of discussion everywhere, and some people even lost confidence, believing that the geological conditions were so bad that the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant had chosen the wrong place to build.

Soviet experts came to the construction site and carefully examined the various conditions of the construction site. After that, they pointed out: The decision to unify the elevation was unnecessary. The railway from Beijing to Taiyuan also uses many natural slopes, why here must all the workshops be built on the same level to facilitate the smooth operation of trains? Moreover, there is still no factory that builds all the workshops at the same elevation. Soviet experts said: Now this factory is like being stuck in a dead end. In order to help us pull the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant "out of the dead end," and in order to enable us to avoid greater waste and errors, Soviet experts conducted a comprehensive rectification of the construction project of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. Although Soviet experts spent a lot of effort and tried all possible methods, such as changing the steel casting workshop to a welding workshop in order to avoid completely abandoning it, thereby avoiding unimaginable consequences and stopping the continued development of errors, because the error had already been formed, it was difficult to achieve perfection as if the error had not occurred.

The losses caused by not following the basic construction procedures are serious, and the adverse consequences are multifaceted.

According to the original plan, the steel casting workshop should have been put into production in 1953. This plan fell through because it was forced to suspend construction midway. The failure of the steel casting workshop to be put into production on time directly affected the production of other workshops. The steel castings that should have been supplied by the steel casting workshop had to be supplied by other factories. The steel ingots needed by the forging and pressing workshop had to be transferred from the Northeast. The steel castings supplied by other factories often could not be delivered on time, or because they did not meet the specifications, the products could not be assembled in time and greatly increased costs, causing great losses to production.

Although the steel casting workshop was changed to a welding workshop to avoid completely abandoning it, it was built to meet the production needs of the steel casting workshop—for example, it was necessary to install open-hearth furnaces and double cranes required for steel casting operations, requiring very high factory buildings, all of which are steel structures. The welding workshop does not need such tall buildings, nor does it need steel structure spans at all, but it needs a large width to make it flexible. The height is not used, and the width is not enough. Therefore, a lot of construction is wasted, or large materials are used for small purposes; a lot of things need to be added and reinforced. What is particularly ridiculous is that when the steel casting workshop was converted into a welding workshop, the excavated soil had to be transported back and the ground inside the workshop had to be raised again.

After many twists and turns, the steel casting workshop was finally converted into a welding workshop. However, where to put the steel casting workshop? The steel casting workshop is the heart of the heavy machinery plant. Its products directly control and affect the production of the entire factory. It is very closely linked to various workshops, especially the iron casting and forging and pressing workshops: the iron castings such as sand boxes and mud cores required by the steel casting workshop are supplied by the iron casting workshop, and the steel ingots it produces are supplied to the forging and pressing workshop. Originally, these three workshops were arranged together. Now that the steel casting workshop is moved, the overall layout of the entire factory is disrupted, and other workshops have to be changed accordingly; of course, this will cause many new problems: the foundation of more than 1,000 cement piles that had been laid in the iron casting workshop had to be abandoned and moved along; the cleaning gas station had to be stopped because it was built without overall design and later found that "the land could not accommodate it," coupled with the lack of design basis because the gasification test of coal was not carried out according to the Soviet expert's suggestion, so it had to be stopped and rebuilt elsewhere, resulting in the tall steel frame that had been built with more than 170,000 yuan being wasted; moving the factory building is not a good thing, but in the case of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, it has to be moved.

Violating the basic construction procedures, many projects have to be carried out step by step. If problems are found during the construction process, stop, look, modify, and then continue. Therefore, the phenomenon of suspension, reconstruction, expansion, and factory relocation is bound to occur frequently. From the start of construction of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant in 1951 to the three years when Soviet experts "pulled it out of the dead end" in 1953, there were dozens of changes, large and small. This has resulted in many projects that have already been completed, such as the partial routes of the five internal railway transportation lines that have already been built, having to be rebuilt; many completed buildings, such as the guard team dormitory, garage, and fire station, had to be completely demolished... All of these not only directly wasted a large amount of state funds (more than 4.2 million yuan); but also, due to project changes and the delay in completion time, a large amount of equipment and materials were bound to be stockpiled. According to statistics, since the establishment of the factory, the value of stockpiled equipment and materials has reached more than 10.98 million yuan.

Wasting and stockpiling a large amount of funds is just one of the bad consequences of violating basic construction procedures. Although this bad consequence has caused us heavy losses, it is not the only one, and it can even be said that it is not the most important one. The main loss is that we have delayed the speed of construction and lost time. Due to the serious violation of basic construction procedures, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has only completed 15% of the factory building construction so far, and it will take two and a half years to complete it. Such a modern factory for manufacturing heavy machinery that our country has never had before, if it is put into production two and a half years later, how many products will it produce less for the country, and how much loss will the country suffer? Because this factory is put into production later, and the supply of various heavy equipment to other factories and mines is delayed, it will also affect the production of other factories, which will cause how much loss to the country?

Now, the Third Party Congress of Shanxi Province has accepted the violation of construction procedures by the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant as a profound lesson. Many representatives from industrial cities and industrial and mining enterprises pointed out that even now, the phenomenon of violating construction procedures in certain aspects and certain problems of basic construction is still very common. The representatives reviewed and criticized their shortcomings and errors in the basic construction work, and resolved to overcome the erroneous ideas of "being fond of greatness and success, greed for more and bigger things, eagerness for quick success, and blind advance," and strive to study hard, work diligently, and better complete the glorious tasks entrusted to themselves by the Party and the country.

    “奇怪的标高”的教训
    本报记者　田流　顾页
    五月二十一日至六月八日山西省举行了党的第三次代表会议。代表会议决定在全省范围内开展一个全面节约和反对浪费的运动，以便更好地完成国家第一个五年计划给予山西省艰巨而光荣的任务。代表会议认为，开展全面节约和反对浪费的运动，必须首先注意消除目前工业基本建设中的严重浪费现象，因为如果这方面的工作做得不好，它所给国家造成的损失和浪费是远远超过其他方面所能给国家造成的损失的。
    太原重型机器厂在建设中违反基本建设程序，浪费和积压国家资金一千五百多万元，推迟完工期限两年半的沉痛教训，引起了代表们的重视。
    太原重型机器厂是一九五一年开始修建的。由于忽视了党的领导作用，和不遵守基本建设程序；不重视设计原始资料的搜集，不重视勘察测量；不及时确定生产纲领；没有产品图纸，便行设计；没有整体设计，即盲目施工，使这个新建工厂一开始就走上了错误道路，造成了许多无可补救的损失。只以那个“奇怪的标高”为例吧，它给我们的国家造成的损失就非常严重。一九五一年建厂初期，负责建厂工作的技术人员支秉渊等到了太原，他们看见未来的工厂将要建筑在一片倾斜的土地上，就觉得它会妨碍火车在各个车间顺利运行。于是，不管地下水的特性如何，就决定了要把所有的车间都建筑在拔海八○三点七公尺这个同一的水平上。
    当时，建厂的工作人员因为没有经验，不懂技术，不了解基本建设的复杂性，再加有盲目冒进、急于求成思想，盲目信任支秉渊的能力和经验，不仅没有坚决依靠苏联专家的指导和帮助，反而轻率地同意了支秉渊这个错误决定，进行了这项破坏自然地质的浩大工程。在挖填了十七万多立方公尺的泥土以后，厂中心地区平坦是平坦了，但地基却遭到了严重的破坏。等工人们搭起铸钢车间数千吨钢材的高大房架时，才发觉几公尺深的原土被挖掉后，地下水位升高了。如果仍在这里安装平炉，它的基础就要有三公尺多泡在水里。谁都知道，平炉基础的任何部位，沾染到一滴水，都会引起爆炸，三公尺多的基础泡在水里怎么行呢？没办法，只好把快要完工的厂房中途停建，派人到全国各地去寻求平炉基础防水办法。铸钢车间发生了地下水问题，别的车间的地下情况如何？人们怀疑起来，很多工程也相继停工了。蓬蓬勃勃的工地，转眼变成一个死气沉沉不可收拾的烂摊子。到处议论纷纷，甚至有的人丧失了信心，认为地质情况这样恶劣，是太原重型机器厂选错修建的地方了。
    苏联专家来到了工地，详细察看了工地的各种情形以后，指出：统一标高的决定是没有必要的。从北京到太原的铁路，也利用了许多天然的坡度，为什么在这里就一定要把所有的车间都建筑在一个水平上，才便于火车顺利运行呢？而且至今还没有一个工厂是把所有的车间都建筑在同一个标高上的。苏联专家说：现在这个工厂像被塞进死胡同一样。为了帮助我们把太原重型机器厂“从死胡同里拉出来”，为了使我们避免更大的浪费和错误，苏联专家对太原重型机器厂的建设工程进行了全面的整顿。虽然苏联专家费尽了心血，想尽了一切可能的办法，如为了使铸钢车间不致完全废弃，把它改为焊接车间等，因而避免了不堪设想的后果，停止了错误的继续发展，但因错误已经形成，就很难做到像没有发生错误那样尽善尽美了。
    没有按照基本建设程序办事，造成的损失是严重的，招致的恶果也是多方面的。
    按照原来的计划，铸钢车间应该在一九五三年投入生产。由于中途被迫停建，这个计划就落空了。铸钢车间不能按时投入生产，直接影响了其他车间的生产。本来应该由铸钢车间供应的铸钢件不得不靠别的工厂供给。锻压车间所需的钢锭，还得向东北去调拨。别的工厂供给的铸钢件，往往不能按期交货，或由于不合规格，产品不仅不能及时装配，还大大增加了成本，使生产遭受很大损失。
    铸钢车间虽然改为焊接车间而不致使它完全废弃，但由于它是适应铸钢车间的生产需要建设的——例如要安装平炉及铸钢操作中需要的双重吊车，需要很高的厂房，并且全部是钢结构。而焊接车间不需要这样高大的建筑，也根本不需要钢结构的跨度，却需很大的宽度，使它周转灵便。高度用不了，宽度又不够，因此，很多的建筑浪费了，或大材小用了；很多的东西又需增添和加固。尤其令人啼笑皆非的，是把铸钢车间改建成焊接车间时，还得把挖去的泥土又搬运回来，再把车间里边的地面垫高。
    经过许多周折，总算把铸钢车间改为焊接车间了。可是，铸钢车间往哪里放呢？铸钢车间是重型机器厂的心脏，它的产品直接控制和影响整个工厂的生产，它和各个车间，特别和铸铁、锻压等车间是联系得非常紧密的：铸钢车间所需要的沙箱，泥心骨等铁铸件是铸铁车间供给的，而它生产的钢锭，又供应着锻压车间，原来这三个车间就布置在一起。现在铸钢车间一迁动，就打乱了整个工厂的平面布置，其他车间也不得不跟着变动了；当然这又会发生许多新的问题：铸铁车间原已打好了一千多根水泥桩的地基，只好废弃，跟着搬家；清洗煤气站，由于没有整体设计便行施工，后来才发现“该地容纳不下”，再加上没有根据苏联专家建议进行煤的气化试验，缺乏设计根据，也不得不停止施工，另行择地修建，致使已用十七万多元修成的高大钢架就算白费了；厂房搬家是一件不好的事情，可是在像太原重型机器厂这种情况下，还只得搬。
    违背了基本建设程序，很多工程不得不走着看，看着走。建筑过程中发现问题了就停停，看看，改改，然后再继续走。因此，就必然常常发生停建、改建、扩建和厂房搬家的现象。从一九五一年太原重型机器厂开始兴建，到一九五三年苏联专家把它“从死胡同里拉出来”的三年当中，大大小小的变动前后达数十次。这就使得许多已经修好了的工程，如已经建好的五条厂内铁路运输线的部分路线还要改建；许多已完工的建筑如警卫队宿舍、汽车库、消防库等不得不全部拆除……所有这些，不仅直接浪费了国家大量的资金（四百二十多万元）；而且由于工程变动，完工时间的推迟，必然要积压大量的设备和材料，据统计，自建厂以来，设备和材料的积压价值竟达一千零九十八万多元。
    浪费和积压大量资金，只是违背基本建设程序的一个恶果，虽然这个恶果给我们的损失是很沉重的，但却不是唯一的，甚至可以说不是最主要的。最主要的损失，还是使我们推迟了建设的速度，输掉了时间。太原重型机器厂由于严重地违反了基本建设程序，到现在才完成了厂房建筑的百分之十五，需要推迟两年半的时间才能完工。这样一个我国从来没有过的制造重型机械的现代化工厂，推迟两年半再投入生产，它给国家少生产了多少产品，使国家遭受多大损失呢？由于这个工厂推迟投入生产，推迟对其他厂矿供应各种重型设备，又影响其他厂的生产，这又给国家造成多大的损失呢？
    现在，山西省党的第三次代表会议，把太原重型机器厂违反建设程序的行为作为一个深刻的教训接受下来，许多来自工业城市、工矿企业的代表指出，就是在目前，在基本建设的某些方面某些问题上违反建设程序的现象还是很普遍的。代表们对自己在基本建设工作中的缺点和错误进行了检查和批判，决心克服“好大喜功，贪多贪大，急于求成，盲目冒进”的错误思想，努力学习，勤恳工作，更好地完成党和国家给予自己的光荣任务。
