Today, we saw the vast Gobi Desert and snow-capped mountains from the plane. In the past, we knew about the vastness of Xinjiang and many things about Xinjiang from books. Seeing it with our own eyes today has added a lot to our experience." Gao Jinchun introduced to the guests the ancient sites of the Thousand Buddha Caves in Kuche and Baicheng areas of Xinjiang, and the Flaming Mountains, said to be passed by Xuanzang on his journey to the west to obtain Buddhist scriptures, explaining that Xinjiang was once a conduit for Sino-Indian cultural exchange in the past.
