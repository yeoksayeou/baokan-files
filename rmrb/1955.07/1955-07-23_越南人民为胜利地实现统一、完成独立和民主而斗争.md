    "Vietnam is like a large tree; its roots, trunk, branches, and leaves are inseparable." This statement by ethnic minority compatriots in the Tây Nguyên (South Vietnam) fully expresses the necessity of Vietnam's unification and the Vietnamese people's strong desire for unification.

    In order to correctly fulfill the Geneva Armistice Agreement, People's Army soldiers and cadres in South Vietnam gathered and came to North Vietnam. The South Vietnamese people's farewell to them and the North Vietnamese people's welcome to them were filled with deep, inseparable feelings of kinship. This feeling cannot be divided by anyone.

    The old women of South Vietnam are learning to read so that when the time comes to realize universal suffrage through struggle, they can fill out their own ballots and not be deceived by others. This is a manifestation of the South Vietnamese people's will to hold universal elections and to unify the country.

    Vietnam's territory extends from north to south without being divided by any natural boundaries. On this beautiful and rich land, the Vietnamese nation has lived together for thousands of years, building a unified economy and a unified culture. They have shared happiness and glory, endured hardships together, and united in heroic struggles.

    The history of nearly a century of resistance to colonial rule also proves the Vietnamese people's strong and unwavering will for unification.

    The French colonialists once divided Vietnam into three "Ky" (regions), each with different methods of rule, in an attempt to erase the Vietnamese people's will to maintain national unity. However, the opposite happened: the people of the whole country remained of one mind. Love for the motherland and compatriots triumphed over all the provocations and divisions carried out by imperialism and feudalism.

    Looking back at all the revolutionary movements of the Vietnamese people against colonialism, they were all national in scope. Especially since 1930, when the Indochinese Communist Party raised the banner of independence and democracy, all patriotic forces from North to South Vietnam have gathered more and more widely. It is no accident that the August Revolution of 1945 achieved victory throughout the country in a short period of time. Under the wise leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the Viet Minh, a national united front organization, mobilized the strength of all the people to participate in the armed uprising. The golden star red flag immediately flew over the entire territory of the motherland, from Móng Cái to Cà Mau.

    On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh read the Declaration of Independence, announcing to the world that Vietnam had the right to freedom and independence, and that we had in fact become a free and independent country.

    When the French colonialists re-ignited the war, plotting to gradually occupy the entire country of Vietnam, starting from the south, the heroic southern people were the first to rise up with bamboo spears and other weapons to block the invaders' advance. The strength of the entire country was also invested in the struggle to defend the country's territory and safeguard national sovereignty.

    The Vietnamese people's will to strive for unity and independence was fully manifested in the universal election of January 6, 1946. At that time, the people in Saigon and Cholon in enemy-occupied areas, regardless of the enemy's brutal suppression, enthusiastically participated in the voting. The universal election was conducted throughout the country, and a unified National Assembly truly representative of all the people was proclaimed. The National Assembly formulated the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and elected the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh.

    The force of unity compelled the French colonialists and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to sign the Preliminary Agreement of March 6, 1946, and the Temporary Agreement of September 14, and shattered the French colonialists' divisive plot to establish the so-called "Autonomous State of Cochinchina."

    However, before the ink was dry on the Temporary Agreement of September 14, the French colonialists launched a war of aggression against the whole of Vietnam. The entire Vietnamese people waged a full eight years of heroic resistance, culminating in the victory of Dien Bien Phu and the signing of the Geneva Accords, which restored peace. The Geneva Accords affirmed the national rights of Vietnam and stipulated that free universal elections should be held to achieve the unification of Vietnam. This great victory proved that the Vietnamese people's desire for unity, independence, and democracy cannot be stopped by any force.

    In order to implement the ceasefire, Vietnam was temporarily divided into two army regrouping areas. However, the final declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulated that "the military demarcation line is a provisional line and cannot in any way be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary," and that free universal elections to unify the country should be held throughout Vietnam in July 1956.

    Universal elections must be held to unify the country. The history of a unified, heroic, and unyielding Vietnamese nation demands it. The sacred rights of the motherland, the heartfelt feelings of the nation, demand it.

    Only by holding universal elections to unify the country can true and lasting peace be consolidated; peace not only for Vietnam but also for Southeast Asia and the world. As long as the ruling forces of U.S. imperialism remain on a part of Vietnam's territory, using it as a base for launching wars, peace will be threatened.

    Unity must be achieved because it is a fundamental condition for completing independence and democracy.

    The South Vietnamese people, living a miserable life under the reign of terror of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem, are eagerly watching every step of the democratic life of the liberated North Vietnamese people, as well as land reform and economic recovery. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and with the fraternal assistance of brotherly countries, North Vietnam is healing the wounds of war and becoming increasingly brilliant and strong. The South Vietnamese compatriots, who share a common motherland, should also live the same happy, independent, and democratic life.

    The North of our country is rich in resources and has a relatively large industrial base; while the South is rich in agricultural products. North Vietnam, now fully liberated, is engaged in industrial construction and the restoration of handicrafts, which will be able to supply the South Vietnamese people with many necessities; conversely, the North can absorb many of the South Vietnamese agricultural products whose prices have plummeted due to imperialist manipulation. As long as the country is not unified and normal relations are not re-established, our country's economy will suffer losses every day.

    The people of North and South Vietnam have the same way of life and the same language, deeply understanding each other's every word, every piece of music, and every folk song. The culture of a unified nation cannot be divided by anyone.

    Therefore, the Vietnamese people repeatedly emphasize that our country is a unified whole, and our nation is a unified whole. It is imperative to continue to implement the Geneva Accords, and it is imperative to hold consultative conferences to arrange for universal elections to realize the unification of the motherland. This is the urgent desire of every Vietnamese person at present.

    More than 20 million united people throughout Vietnam unanimously responded to the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on February 4, 1955, regarding the restoration of normal relations between the North and South, and the statement of June 6, 1955, regarding preparations for holding consultative conferences with the South Vietnamese authorities to discuss the issue of universal elections.

    For more than a month, the people in various parts of Vietnam have launched a movement demanding consultative conferences to discuss universal elections. Participants in this struggle include people from all walks of life, all religions, all nationalities, and overseas compatriots. The forms of struggle include political, economic, cultural, and social activities.

    In the southern half, in Saigon and Cholon, where Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial regime exercises the strictest control, broad sections of the people from all walks of life participated in strikes and market closures on July 10, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hold consultative conferences to arrange elections. The Southern people have also launched a movement to provide relief to refugees who have suffered disaster due to the conflicts between Ngo Dinh Diem and various sects. Tens of thousands of compatriots forced to move south are continuing their struggle to return to the North. These facts demonstrate the growing strength of the South Vietnamese people's struggle movement for unity, independence, and democracy. Upholding the glorious tradition of heroic struggle, the Southern people are worthy of the title of "Iron Wall of the Motherland," awarded by President Ho Chi Minh.

    In North Vietnam, especially in the capital Hanoi, people from all walks of life enthusiastically responded to the call of the Vietnam National United Front. The various political parties and people's organizations within the front held rallies, and everyone pledged to consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects, and to contribute to the struggle for national unification through practical actions of promoting the patriotic emulation movement. The liberation of North Vietnam is the result of the victory of the national resistance war and is the base for the current political struggle. Only when the strength of the North Vietnamese people is consolidated and continuously strengthened can the struggle of the entire people gain a strong pillar to strive for the completion of national liberation. Recognizing this, workers and peasants launched emulation drives, achieving concrete results in improving work efficiency and restoring and developing production. Literary and art workers and intellectuals conducted creation and invention in a planned manner and with a spirit of emulation. Cadres and staff actively improved their work and participated in land reform work. Many industrialists and businessmen are changing their business direction and developing their business in accordance with the policies of the Republic Government.

    In the People's Army, the movement to respond to the government's call for holding consultative conferences to discuss universal elections has become a powerful factor in promoting training and consolidating national defense.

    Every department, every aspect, and everyone is working hard for a common task, that is, to realize unity, complete independence, and democracy.

    This just struggle of the Vietnamese people is receiving the sympathy and active support of peace-loving people around the world. The Helsinki World Peace Congress fully supports the position of the Vietnamese people. The French people, prominent figures, and politicians in France are demanding that the French government respect its signature on the Geneva Accords. Chairman Bulganin, Chairman Cyrankiewicz, and Prime Minister Nehru, in the joint statements of the Soviet-Indian and Polish-Indian governments, explicitly demanded the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and that the countries responsible for the Geneva Accords fulfill their tasks.

    In particular, the joint communiqués issued recently after the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, held separate talks with the Governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, demonstrated the completely consistent position taken by the peoples and governments of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the struggle to achieve universal elections and the unification of Vietnam. The friendship and active support of the 600 million people of neighboring brotherly countries and the people of other countries in the peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are a reliable guarantee and a strong backing for the Vietnamese people's struggle.

    At present, U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are still resorting to all means to undermine the Geneva Accords, oppose consultations, and oppose universal elections. The Vietnamese people know that the road to national unification, completion of independence, and democracy is not smooth and easy; on the contrary, it is extremely complex and tortuous.

    However, the Vietnamese people, who have overcome many difficulties and hardships in the long-term resistance war, have clearly known their strength and the path to victory. In the face of difficulties, the Vietnamese people will not be discouraged in the slightest. We firmly believe in justice, in our own strength, in the wise and brilliant leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in the sincere sympathy and support of the people of the world. The Vietnamese people will strengthen unity and resolutely struggle to realize national unification through universal elections in strict accordance with the Geneva Accords.

    In the face of the will and determination of a nation that has won the victory of the resistance war, all conspiracies and forces that attempt to undermine our national unity and infringe upon our national sovereignty and territorial integrity are destined to fail.

    The Vietnamese people, closely united within the national united front, widely uniting all forces that support peace and unity, and more actively persevering in the struggle, will surely be able to consolidate peace, realize unity, and complete independence and democracy.

    越南人民为胜利地实现统一、完成独立和民主而斗争
    越南民主共和国国民大会常务委员会代主席  越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席  孙德胜
    “越南好比一棵大树，它的根、茎、枝叶是不可分离的。”西原（南越）少数民族同胞的这一句话，充分地表现了越南的必须统一和越南人民强烈要求统一的意志。
    为了正确地履行日内瓦停战协定，在南越的人民军战士和干部集结到北越来了。南越人民对他们的欢送和北越人民对他们的迎接，都怀着一种深厚的骨肉相连的感情。这种感情是任何人也不能够分割的。
    南越的老大娘们正在学识字，以备通过斗争实现普选的时候，自己能填写自己所投的票，不让人欺骗自己。这是南越人民一定要举行普选，一定要统一国家的意志的表现。
    越南的领土自北而南地伸延着，没有被任何自然界限所分割。在这个美丽富饶的土地上，越南民族有了成千年的历史，他们共同地生活着，建立了统一的经济、统一的文化，并且共同享受过幸福和光荣，共同忍受过艰难困苦，团结在一起进行了英勇的斗争。
    近百年来反对殖民主义统治的历史，也证明了越南人民强烈的和坚韧不拔的统一意志。
    法国殖民者曾把越南分成三个“圻”，各用不同的统治方式，企图磨灭越南人民维护国家统一的意志。但是，恰得其反，全国人民仍旧心一条。爱祖国、爱同胞的心情，战胜了帝国主义和封建主义所进行的一切挑拨离间。
    回溯过去越南人民反对殖民主义的一切革命运动，都是带有全国性的。特别是从一九三零年印度支那共产党高举着独立与民主的旗帜起，从北越到南越的一切爱国主义力量，就日益广泛地集合起来了。一九四五年八月革命在一段短短的时间内在全国的范围内取得胜利，这不是偶然的事。在印度支那共产党的英明的领导下，全国性的民族统一战线的组织——越盟动员了全体人民的力量，齐心参加武装起义，金星红旗顿时飘扬在从睦南关到金瓯角的整个祖国土地的上空。
    一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席宣读独立宣言，向全世界宣布：越南应该有权得到自由和独立，而且事实上我们已经成了一个自由和独立的国家。
    当法国殖民主义者重新挑起战争，阴谋从南部开始，逐渐占领越南全国的时候，英勇的南部人民就首先奋起以竹矛等武器来阻挡侵略者的进路。全国的力量也投入了保卫祖国领土、保卫民族主权的斗争中。
    越南人民争取统一和独立的意志，充分表现在一九四六年一月六日的普选中。当时，在敌占区的西贡、堤岸市的人民，也不顾敌人的野蛮镇压，热烈地参加了投票。普选在全国进行了，一个真正代表全体人民的统一的国会宣告成立。国会制定了越南民主共和国宪法，选出了以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府。
    统一的力量已迫使法国殖民者和越南民主共和国政府签订了一九四六年三月六日的初步协定和九月十四日的临时协定，并粉碎了法国殖民者企图成立所谓“南圻自治国”的分裂阴谋。
    但是，九月十四日临时协定的墨迹未干，法国殖民者又挑起了对越南全国性的侵略战争。全越人民进行了整整八年的英勇抗战，最后以奠边府的胜利和日内瓦协定的签订，恢复了和平。日内瓦协议确认了越南的民族权利，规定举行自由普选来实现越南的统一。这个伟大的胜利，证明了越南人民要求统一、独立和民主的意志，是任何力量也不能阻止的。
    为了实现停战，越南暂时分成两个军队驻扎地区。但日内瓦会议最后宣言明白规定“军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”，要在一九五六年七月，在越南全国进行统一国家的自由普选。
    必须举行普选来统一国家。一个统一、英勇不屈的越南民族的历史一定要这样做。祖国的神圣权利，民族的恳切感情，一定要这样做。
    只有举行普选来统一国家，才能巩固真正的、持久的和平；那不仅是越南而且是东南亚和世界的和平。只要美帝国主义的统治势力还保持在越南的一部分领土上，以此作为其挑起战争的基地，和平就要遭受着威胁。
    必须实现统一，因为那是完成独立与民主的基本条件。
    正处在美帝国主义和吴庭艳恐怖统治下过着悲惨的生活的南越人民，殷切地注视着解放了的北越人民的民主生活以及土地改革和经济恢复的每一个步骤。在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，在兄弟国家的兄弟般的援助下，北越正在医治战争创伤，日益显得灿烂和强盛。有着共同的祖国的南越同胞，也应该过同样的幸福、独立与民主的生活。
    我们祖国的北方资源丰富，并且有较多的工业基础；而南方富有农产品。北越如今获得了完全解放，正在从事工业建设和手工业的恢复，这将能供应南方人民以许多必需品；反之，北方又能为南方消纳许多由于帝国主义的操纵而价格暴跌的南越的农产品。只要国家一天未获统一，正常关系一天未获重建，那末，我国的经济便要一天遭受损失。
    越南北方和南方人民，具有同一的生活方式和同一的语言文字，互相之间深深地了解每一句语言、每一支乐曲和民谣。一个统一的民族的文化，是任何人所不能分割的。
    因此，越南人民再三强调，我们的国家是一个统一的整体，我们的民族是一个统一的整体。必须继续实施日内瓦协议，必须举行协商会议安排普选来实现祖国的统一，这是目前每一个越南人民的迫切愿望。
    越南全国两千多万统一的人民，一致响应越南民主共和国政府一九五五年二月四日关于恢复南北正常关系的声明和一九五五年六月六日关于准备同南越当局举行协商会议以讨论普选问题的声明。
    一个多月以来，越南各地人民已开始了要求举行协商会议讨论普选的运动。参加这一斗争的，包括了各阶层人民、各宗教、各民族和海外侨胞。斗争的方式包括了政治的、经济的、文化的和社会的各方面活动。
    在南半部，在吴庭艳独裁制度控制最严的西贡、堤岸，各阶层广大人民就在七月十日参加了罢工和罢市，要求南越当局和越南民主共和国政府举行安排选举的协商会议。南方人民并且开展了救济因吴庭艳和各教派的冲突而遭遇灾难的难民的运动。成千成万被迫南迁的同胞，也正在继续进行要求返回北方的斗争。这些事实证明了南半部人民争取统一、独立和民主的斗争运动的日益强大。南方人民坚持着英勇斗争的光荣传统，不愧胡志明主席所奖励的“祖国的铜墙铁壁”的称号。
    在北越，尤其是在首都河内，各界人民热烈响应越南国民联合战线的号召，战线中的各个政党和人民团体，都举行了集会，所有的人都保证从各个方面来巩固北越，以推进爱国主义竞赛运动的实际行动来为统一国家的斗争作出贡献。北越的解放是全国抗战的胜利的结果，是目前的政治斗争的基地。北越人民的力量获得巩固和不断壮大，全国人民的斗争才能获得坚强的支柱，以争取完成民族的解放。由于这种认识，工人、农民们展开了竞赛，取得了提高工作效率、恢复和发展生产的具体成绩。文艺工作者、知识分子有计划地以竞赛的精神进行了创作、发明。干部、职员们积极地改进工作和参加土地改革工作。许多工商业者正在按照共和国政府的政策转变经营方向和发展经营。
    在人民军部队中，响应政府关于举行协商会议讨论普选问题的运动，成为了促进训练、巩固国防的一个强有力的因素。
    各个部门，各个方面，每一个人都在为共同的任务而努力，即一定要实现统一，完成独立和民主。
    越南人民这一正义的斗争，正受到世界爱好和平人民的同情和积极支持。赫尔辛基世界和平大会，完全支持越南人民的立场。法国人民、法国的著名人士和政治家，正在要求法国政府必须尊重自己在日内瓦协议上的签字。布尔加宁主席、西伦凯维兹主席和尼赫鲁总理在苏印、波印的联合声明中，都明确地要求继续执行日内瓦协定，要求对日内瓦协定负有责任的国家要完成自己的任务。
    特别是最近以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团分别和中华人民共和国政府、苏联政府会谈后发表的联合公报，表明了越、中、苏三国人民和政府在关于执行日内瓦协议，实现越南的普选和统一的斗争中所采取的完全一致的立场。邻邦兄弟国家的六亿人民和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营其他国家人民的友谊和积极支持，是越南人民的斗争的可靠保证和强大后盾。
    现在，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团仍是不择手段，多方破坏日内瓦协定、反对协商、反对普选。越南人民知道，通往国家的统一、完成独立和民主的道路，并非平坦和容易的，相反地，是极其复杂和崎岖的。
    但是，曾经克服了长期抗战的许多艰难困苦的越南人民已经清楚地知道自己的力量和胜利的道路何在。在困难面前，越南人民丝毫不会气馁。我们坚信正义，相信自己本身的力量，相信胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明的、天才的领导，相信世界人民的真挚同情与支持。越南人民将加强团结，为正确按照日内瓦协定，通过普选实现国家的统一而坚决地进行斗争。
    在曾经取得抗战的胜利的民族的意志和决心面前，一切想要破坏我们国家的统一，侵犯我们的民族主权和领土的完整的阴谋和力量，是注定要失败的。
    越南人民在民族统一战线内紧密团结，广泛地团结一切赞成和平、统一的力量，更加积极地坚持斗争，是一定能巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立与民主的。
