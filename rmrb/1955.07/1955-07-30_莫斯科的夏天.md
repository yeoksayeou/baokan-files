    Moscow's Summer
    Zi Gang

    We made two stopovers in Moscow, on our way to and from Helsinki for the World Peace Congress.

    Muscovites are complaining that this summer isn't hot enough. Last year, early July saw temperatures of 36-37 degrees Celsius, while this year it's only around 20 degrees, and you need a sweater or light coat in the mornings and evenings. Only in crowded museums, exhibitions, or theaters do people feel a little bit like they might sweat.

    But Muscovites have a habit of escaping the heat, spending their summers in the countryside. The main theaters like the Bolshoi and Maly are not showing plays featuring star actors, only local troupes are performing there. Muscovites will tell you, "There are fewer children on the streets of Moscow now because they've gone to the countryside." Changing the living environment has significance and effects beyond just escaping the heat.

    Soviet people love to swim. In Moscow, we saw people everywhere with healthy, tanned skin, having clearly spent time sunbathing somewhere. At Moscow University, the indoor swimming pool has clear, green, heated water, making even those who can't swim want to jump in.

    Moscow University, on summer vacation, isn't deserted, though. Some faculty and students have gone to sanatoriums, while others remain at the university to continue their research or prepare for trips abroad. The Communist Youth League has designed various low-cost trips for students. One Chinese student told me he was planning to visit a dozen cities along the Volga-Don Canal.

    Moscow has always had a large transient population, and recently is no exception. Not to mention the delegations from many countries invited to the Soviet Union to attend the World Peace Congress, there is also a constant stream of domestic and foreign guests coming to Moscow to study and visit during the summer. It's impossible for a delegation of dozens of people to stay in the same hotel; they have to find rooms scattered around. If you want to visit the Stalin Automobile Factory or the famous Ball Bearing Factory, or see the magnificent art galleries, you have to notify them a few days in advance to be scheduled in order.

    We were fortunate enough to visit the paintings from the Dresden Gallery. The Soviet Red Army collected the valuable works of the Dresden Gallery that Hitler had scattered in various locations, and plans to return this property of the German people to Germany in the future. For now, they are being exhibited in Moscow. To our surprise, this exhibition has been at the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts for three months, and the line at the entrance still stretches beyond the street, with men, women, and children holding umbrellas, waiting patiently to feast their eyes. As foreign guests, we were exceptionally allowed to enter and exit through the back door. People can't help but think: the endless queues in front of Lenin's and Stalin's tombs are for commemorating and respecting the founders of the Party; the long lines in front of department stores are because the socialist economy has prospered people's material lives, while the lines in front of the art gallery illustrate the surge in cultural life in socialist society. Although the paintings in the Dresden Gallery are mostly from the Italian, Dutch, Spanish, French, and German centuries prior, and many paintings are inseparable from the realm of religion, some painters have injected new ideas into traditional religious paintings, embodying vivid life in their works, whether portraits, landscapes, or historical narratives. Muscovites look at paintings with great care, constantly taking notes and commenting. When someone explains to a delegation, people always gather to listen, absorbing spiritual nourishment so eagerly. The most valuable painting in the gallery is Raphael's Madonna, from the Italian Renaissance period, said to be the best of his authentic works. The Madonna in the painting has the kindness and solemnity of a typical mother, and her face is extremely beautiful. The old man representing God in the painting is asking her to hand over her son. She is holding her son in her arms, peacefully handing him over, but it is not impossible to see the struggle in her heart, supposedly to save humanity. A maid and two little angels are accompanying her; the son, Christ, is naked, his face as innocent and ignorant as that of any adorable baby, with one small foot resting on his mother's waist. Every person who views the painting stops in front of it, resonating with the brushstrokes of the great painter from four centuries ago. This painting is specially cordoned off with silk ropes, and a guard comrade in a white uniform and red hat is stationed in front of it, afraid that someone will damage this famous painting. This is how Moscow vigilantly and cherishly treats the cultural heritage of mankind. A catalog of the Dresden Gallery (with a selection of famous paintings reproduced in it) has already been published.

    The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition has been held three times (1923, 1939-1941, and 1954). The agricultural exhibition that opened last year is the largest exhibition in the world. There are buses inside, and it would take a week to see everything carefully. Because it extensively reflects the development and achievements of socialist agriculture, people from far and wide continue to come to visit endlessly. Also, because there are many theaters, concert halls, restaurants, and garden attractions within the venue, it has become another place for cultural relaxation. The Stone Flower Fountain and the golden statue fountain representing the sixteen republics are not just magnificent and captivating; they are truly capable of expanding people's spiritual realm and allowing working people to forget their fatigue. Standing in front of the fountain for a moment becomes part of a beautiful life.

    One evening we went to the Green Theater at the exhibition to see folk song and dance performances. We discovered that, despite the exhibition being in the suburbs, every theater and concert hall was full for the evening shows. Coming out after the show was especially dazzling. The outside was like a fairyland, with lights everywhere, torches everywhere. Some rooftops and eaves were no longer visible as brick and mortar, but were lined with lights. All kinds of streetlights, all kinds of lighting between sculptures and fountains, and even electric lights buried under the juniper bushes, illuminating the leaves so they were exquisite and translucent, as if the world's finest green jade was glowing. And the white fountains were gently rolling beaded curtains. People liked to walk close to splash themselves, enjoying that slight coolness. In the light and the veil of the fountain, each goddess statue was graceful, as if given life.

    Muscovites and those who come to Moscow enjoy such summer scenery, sitting on the green chairs for a long time, unwilling to go back. Fortunately, there are several bus routes in front of the gate, costing one and a half rubles to return to the city center.

    On the buses or subways at night, we often encountered many people returning home late at night, carrying large packages of books. They may have been returning from the library, from night school, or from a lecture hall. We couldn't help but look at them with respect, cheering silently in our hearts: diligent and studious Muscovites!

    Just as the clothes Muscovites wear become more beautiful year by year, the cultural level of Muscovites is also generally improving. Naturally, this is true throughout the Soviet Union. Taking the friends we met as an example, the guides at the Agricultural Exhibition, the guides at the art gallery, the translators at the hotel and every airport, each one is a university graduate. They do ordinary but noble work. The important thing is that they are all working in their positions and conducting research in their spare time, never standing still. Comrade Ma Xuelan, whose Chinese name translates to Ma Xuelan, is a graduate of the former Oriental University and works at the Academy of Sciences. She received good news back from Helsinki: her master's thesis has passed. It's a 371-page thesis titled "Chinese Poetry during the Anti-Japanese War." In order to collect materials for her thesis, she lived in Beijing for seven months. Naturally, we congratulated her on her joyous news. Many Soviet people are writing their master's and doctoral theses while working. The main thing is not the degree, but the diligent spirit and the general improvement of cultural level.

    We also "toured" the subway, guided by Ye Xiaming, who had worked at the TASS Chinese branch. The newly built platforms in the past two years are even more magnificent than the old ones. Even in the summer, transporting 2.5 million passengers every day does not seem crowded or hot, because the subway maintains a temperature of no less than five degrees Celsius in winter and no more than twenty-five degrees Celsius in summer.

    Moscow has not stopped construction in the summer, but is proceeding at a rapid pace. There was a half-month difference between our two stopovers, and a multi-story building had risen from half its height to its top floor. This illustrates the speed of Moscow's construction.

    莫斯科的夏天
    子冈
    为了去赫尔辛基开世界和平大会，我们来去两次作了莫斯科的过客。
    莫斯科人都嫌今年的夏天不够热，去年七月初热到摄氏三十六七度，而今年才在二十度左右，早晚还穿毛衣或夹大衣，只有在拥挤的博物馆、展览会或戏院里，人们才有一点点几乎要流汗的感觉。
    但是莫斯科人有避暑的习惯，在夏天要过一过乡下生活。大剧院、小剧院等剧院名演员的戏是看不到了，只有地方剧团在这些剧院来演出。莫斯科人会告诉你说：“现在在莫斯科街上看到的儿童特别少，因为他们下乡了。”变换生活环境，其意义和效果不止于避暑一件事。
    苏联人喜欢游水，在莫斯科我们到处可以看到不知是在哪里曝日而皮肤呈现出健康的红黑色的人们。在莫斯科大学里，室内游泳池里是碧绿而澄澈的温水，使得不会游水的人也想跳下去。
    放了暑假的莫斯科大学却并不冷落，一部分师生到疗养所去了，一部分人仍然留在学校里继续在研究，或是准备不久出外旅行。共青团组织为同学们设计了不同路线、付费极少的旅行，有一位中国留学生告诉我，他准备参加访问伏尔加河—顿河运河沿岸十几个城市的旅行。
    莫斯科的流动人口一向占很大的百分比，最近也不例外。应邀来苏联访问的出席世界和平大会的许多国家的代表团不用说，利用暑期来莫斯科学习和参观的国内外客人也是纷至沓来。一个几十人的代表团想同住一个旅馆是不可能的，必须分散找房间。要想参观斯大林汽车工厂或是有名的轴承工厂，要想看一下瑰丽的画廊，必须早几天通知，好按序排列。
    我们幸运地去参观了一下来自德累斯顿画廊的名画，苏联红军把希特勒散藏在各处的德累斯顿画廊的珍贵作品搜集起来，准备将来把这德国人民的财产还给德国，如今先在莫斯科展览。使我们惊讶的是，这个展览在国立普希金造型艺术博物馆展出已经三个月了，门口的行列还是一直延长到街口以外去，男女老少打着伞安详地等在那里，好一饱眼福。我们是外宾，因此破例从后门出入。人们会联想到：列宁、斯大林墓前无尽的长蛇阵是为了对于党的创始者的怀念和尊敬，百货商场门前的长蛇阵是因为社会主义经济繁荣了人们的物质生活，而画廊前的长蛇阵又说明了社会主义社会文化生活的高涨。尽管德累斯顿画廊的画多是意大利、荷兰、西班牙、法国、德国前几世纪的画，很多画离不开宗教范畴，但是一些画家在宗教传统画之中注入了新思想，在作品中体现了栩栩如生的生活，不论是肖像、风景、历史故事的画幅都是一样。莫斯科人看画是极细致的，不断地在那里记录，品评。碰上有人给哪个代表团解释，总有人附上来倾听，他们是那样贪婪地吸取精神营养。画廊中最宝贵的一幅画是意大利文艺复兴时期拉斐尔的圣母像，据说这是他真笔中最好的一幅。画上的圣母具有一般母亲的慈祥和庄严，面容也极美丽，画面上代表神的老头要她交出儿子，她手上正托抱着儿子，宁静地把他交出，但也并不是看不出她内心有斗争，据说是为了拯救人类。一个侍女两个小安琪儿作陪衬；儿子基督赤身，脸上和一般可爱的婴孩一样，天真无知，一只小脚抵在母亲腰上。没有一个看画的人不在这张画前停留，被四世纪前的伟大画家的笔触引起共鸣。这张画特别用丝索拦住，并有一名白色制服红帽箍的警卫同志在画前看守，生怕有人碰伤了这张名画。莫斯科就是这样警戒而又珍爱地对待人类文化遗产的。关于德累斯顿画廊的目录册（摄印了一部分名画在上面）已经出版了。
    全苏农业展览会一共举办过三次（一九二三年，一九三九年——四一年，一九五四年），去年开幕的这个农业展览会是世界上最大规模的展览会了。里面有公共汽车代步，仔细看的话，一个星期也看不完。正因为它广泛地反映着社会主义农业的发展和成就，所以至今远近赶来参观的人无止无休。也因为会场内有很多剧场、音乐厅、饭馆和园林名胜，也就成为又一个文化休息的场所。宝石花喷泉和代表十六个共和国的女神金像喷泉说是巍峨壮丽、引人入胜还不够，它们实在是足以拓展人们的精神境界，让劳动人民忘却疲倦。在喷泉前站立片刻，成为美好生活的一部分。
    有一晚我们到展览会的绿色剧场去看民间歌舞，我们发现，尽管展览会在郊区，但个个剧场、音乐厅的晚场都是满座的。散场出来，尤其使人眼花撩乱，外面竟是神仙世界一般，到处是灯光，到处是火炬，有些屋顶屋沿已不见砖瓦洋灰，而是灯光栉比。各式各样的路灯，雕塑和喷泉间各式各样的照明，甚至冬青树下也倒埋着电灯，把树叶照得玲珑剔透，仿佛是世上最优质的绿翡翠在发光。而白色的喷泉正轻盈地卷着珠帘，人们喜欢走近去浇一浇，享受一下那微微的凉意。在灯光照耀和喷泉的薄纱中，女神塑像个个多姿，好像赋与了生命。
    莫斯科人和来到莫斯科的人就享受着这样的夏景，长久地坐在绿椅上不愿回去。好在门前有几路公共汽车，花一个半卢布就可以回到市中心去。
    在晚上的公共汽车或地下电车中，我们曾经碰到不少夹了大包书籍的读书夜归人。他们可能是从图书馆回来的，可能是从夜大学回来的，可能是从讲演厅回来的，我们不能不尊敬地看他们一眼，心中暗暗喝采：好学不倦的莫斯科人！
    正像莫斯科人身上的衣衫一年比一年漂亮一样，莫斯科人的文化水平也在普遍提高。自然，全苏联也是如此。就以我们遇到的朋友们来说，农业展览会的讲解员、画廊的讲解员、旅舍和每一个飞机站上的译员们，哪一位都是大学毕业生，他们作着普通的但是高贵的工作，重要的是都在岗位上在业余时间进行钻研，从来不停滞不前。中译名叫作马雪兰的女同志是前东方大学的毕业生，在科学院工作，她从赫尔辛基回来获得了好消息：她的硕士论文通过了，这是一篇三百七十一页长的论文，题目是：“抗日战争时期的中国诗”，为了搜集论文材料，她曾来北京住过七个月。自然，我们为了她的喜事祝贺。许多苏联人都是在一边工作一边写硕士、博士论文，主要的不在学位，而是在孜孜不倦的精神和文化水平的普遍提高。
    我们又去“游”了地下电车，由曾在塔斯社中国分社工作的叶夏明向导。近二年新建的站台比旧的更华丽。即使在夏天，每天运送二百五十万乘客也不显得拥挤或炎热，因为地下电车维持着这样的温度，在冬天不低于摄氏五度，在夏天不高于摄氏二十五度。
    莫斯科在夏天也没有停止建设，而是在飞速地进行。两次过路时间相差半月，有一所大建筑的多层楼房已由半截升到了最高一层。这可以说明莫斯科建设的速度。
