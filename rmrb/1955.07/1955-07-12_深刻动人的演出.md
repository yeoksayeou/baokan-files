    A Profound and Moving Performance
    By Shi Lemeng, Art Director of the Song and Dance Troupe,
    General Political Department, Chinese People's Liberation Army

    Since childhood, through many stories and legends, the Mongolian people have left us with a deep impression. We imagined the boundless plains, the endless green grasslands, the flower-like tents, the cloud-like flocks of sheep, and the brave and strong heroes galloping across this land. These fairytale-like fantasies were filled with our respect for the heroic Mongolian people.

    With the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic and the unfolding of its socialist construction, and with the development of the fighting friendship between China and Mongolia during the Anti-Japanese War, our respect for the Mongolian people has grown day by day. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the unity and friendship between our two peoples has been further consolidated and expanded in the process of building our respective homelands and defending world peace. We love the Mongolian people as we love ourselves. When we heard the news that our honored guests—the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army—were coming to our capital, every comrade in our song and dance troupe felt excited. With the mood of celebrating a festival, we practiced Mongolian songs, wanting to use Mongolian songs to welcome our honored guests.

    The performance of the honored guests began. The entire stage was lively, joyful, and simple. The first thing that caught attention was the orchestra. Although they also had general Western musical instruments, due to their ingenious artistic arrangements, they gave people a very prominent impression of strong national characteristics. Especially meticulous was the placement of the sanxian (a three-stringed plucked instrument), making people clearly feel that the arrangement of the orchestra had both a center of gravity and an overall harmony and unity, and that the rhythm was both varied and not chaotic. No wonder the audience couldn't help but say before the program even started: "I really like their orchestra!"

    The program began. Their artistic talents tightly grasped the heartstrings of the audience. National musical instruments and Western musical instruments were cleverly combined, the clear melodies of the national musical instruments were clear without being prominent. The entire orchestra's accompaniment was blended with the chorus, becoming an inseparable whole. The changes in dynamics were distinct and appropriate, the soft parts were like quiet river water, but still retained the vitality they should have; the strong parts showed the momentum of overturning mountains and seas. What was especially touching was that in the key moments of emotional changes and dynamic changes, they were meticulous without being pretentious. The conductor Tserendavga's profound understanding of the works, his outstanding conducting talent, and his serious, hardworking, responsible spirit and high artistic accomplishment made the performance of the songs and dances a perfect artistic creation. The performance of "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" had a unique interpretation, and "Song of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army" was also deeply moving.

    The song "Road of Friendship" not only has a great practical significance in its lyrics (this railway closely connects the capitals of three friendly countries—the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China), but also has a distinct musical image in its melody. Particularly valuable is its clear Mongolian style, which strongly moves Chinese listeners.

    The very beautiful and moving melody of the song "Mother's Grace" and the delicate performance of the singer Purvusuren brought warmth and sweetness to the people, allowing the audience to share the singer's happiness.

    The songs "Song of Youth" and "Glory Belongs to Sukhbaatar" are full of touching life atmosphere, lyrical and with the power of battle. The ending of "Song of Youth" and the conductor's soft and elastic movements proved the conductor's talent.

    The a cappella chorus "Ode to the Altai Mountains" showed a high degree of artistic creation, like a beautiful sound painting bringing people into a realm of poetry and fantasy, which is precisely the glorious Altai Mountains, rich and bright, with countless treasures and silver-white peaks.

    The female chorus "The Horse That Breaks Away from the Herd" and the song and dance "Aksala," as well as other dance programs, all gave us a deep impression. Although we don't understand the Mongolian language and are not familiar with Mongolian customs, from the singing, the dance, and the expression of deep emotions, we deeply felt the Mongolian people's steadfastness, unyielding spirit, and the heroic character and qualities of resourcefulness and bravery.

    This beautiful performance powerfully illustrates the amazing achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in cultural and artistic construction over the past thirty-four years. Their performance provides us with many inspirations and is worthy of our careful study. (Attached picture)

    深刻动人的演出
    中国人民解放军总政治部
    文艺工作团歌舞团艺术指导  时乐濛
    从孩童时代起，通过许多故事和传说，蒙古人民就给我们深刻的印象。我们曾想像着那平沙无垠的原野、碧绿无边的草原、花朵似的篷帐、云朵般的羊群和那勇敢雄健地奔驰在这块土地上的英雄们。在这些童话式的幻想中，充满着我们对英雄的蒙古人民的崇敬。
    随着蒙古人民共和国的成立及其社会主义建设的展开，随着中、蒙两国在抗日战争中的战斗友谊的发展，我们对蒙古人民的崇敬与日俱增。中华人民共和国成立以来，在建设各自的祖国和保卫世界和平的过程中，我们两国人民之间的团结和友谊更加巩固和扩大了。我们像热爱我们自己一样地热爱着蒙古人民。当我们听到我们的贵宾——蒙古人民革命军歌舞团要来到我们首都的消息时，我们歌舞团的每个同志都感到激动和兴奋，以过佳节的心情练习着蒙古歌曲，要用蒙古歌曲来欢迎我们的贵宾。
    贵宾们的演出开始了。整个舞台是活泼、愉快、朴素的。首先引人注目的是乐队。虽然他们也有一般的西洋乐器，但由于他们在艺术上的巧妙的安排，给人们以非常突出的印象是强烈的民族色彩。尤其细致的是三弦的位置，使人明确地感到乐队的排列既有重心而又是整体协和一致，节奏既有变化而又不紊乱，难怪观众在节目尚未开始时就情不自禁地说：“我真喜欢他们的乐队！”
    节目开始了。他们艺术上的才能紧紧掌握住了听众的心弦。民族乐器和西洋乐器巧妙地结合在一起，清晰的民族乐器的旋律既明确而又不突出。整个乐队的伴奏又同合唱交融在一起，成为一个不可分割的整体。强弱的变化是鲜明而恰当的，弱的地方像静静的河水，但仍不失应有的活跃的弹力；强烈的地方则表现出排山倒海的气势。尤其感人的是在情绪变化、强弱变化的关键，做到了细致而不做作。指挥策仍道尔吉对作品的深刻理解，他的卓越的指挥才能，以及他的严肃、刻苦、负责的劳动精神和高度艺术修养，使得歌、舞的演出成为完美的艺术创造。“中国人民解放军进行曲”的演唱有独到的发挥，而“蒙古人民革命军之歌”，也感人很深。
    “友谊之路”这个歌曲不仅在歌词上有其伟大的现实的意义（这条铁路把三个友好的国家——苏联、蒙古、中国的首都紧密地联结在一起），而且在曲调上具有鲜明的音乐形象，特别可贵的是它的明确的蒙古风格，强烈地感动着中国的听众。
    歌曲“母亲的恩情”的非常优美动人的旋律，和演唱者普尔布苏仍的细腻的表现，给人们带来了温暖和甜蜜，使听众分享了演唱者的幸福。
    歌曲“青年之歌”、“光荣属于苏赫·巴托尔”充满着动人的生活气息，抒情而有战斗的力量。“青年之歌”的结束，指挥的柔和而又有弹力的动作证明了指挥的才能。
    无伴奏合唱“阿尔泰山颂”显示了高度的艺术创造，如同一幅美妙的音画将人们带进了诗的和幻想的境界，而这正是富饶而明朗、有无数的宝藏和银白色的山峰的光荣的阿尔泰山。
    女声合唱“脱群之马”和歌舞“阿克萨拉”以及其它的舞蹈节目，都给我们以深刻的印象。虽然我们不懂蒙古的语言，也不熟悉蒙古的风俗习惯，但从歌声、舞姿和深刻的情感的表现中，我们深切地感到了蒙古人民的坚强不屈，机智勇敢的英雄性格和品质。
    这个美好的演出，有力地说明了蒙古人民共和国三十四年来在文化艺术建设上的惊人的成就。他们的演出，对我们有许多启发，值得我们好好地学习。（附图片）
