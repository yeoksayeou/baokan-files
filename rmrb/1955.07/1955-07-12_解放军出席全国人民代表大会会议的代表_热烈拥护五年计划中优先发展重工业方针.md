The People's Liberation Army delegates attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress are intently studying the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. They have shown the highest enthusiasm for the plan's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry.

The delegates have used their own personal experiences to illustrate the necessity and correctness of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Delegate Liu Meicun, from the southern border of the motherland, said: With heavy industry, not only can light industry be rapidly promoted, and our agriculture be equipped with tractors, etc., and the transportation industry with airplanes, automobiles, etc., but also national defense can obtain a strong foundation of modern equipment, greatly strengthening the power of our armed forces to defend the motherland. Based on his own experience, he said: When liberating Hainan Island, we crossed the sea in wooden boats. Not long after the boat set sail, the wind stopped. The enemy's planes were harassing us in the air. So everyone used oars to row, and rowed in the sea until dawn before approaching Hainan Island. By the time we landed, everyone had blisters on their hands. If we had warships and landing craft, tens of thousands of people would have reached Hainan Island in a moment, and we could have used the ship's artillery to cover the landing. Comrade Wang Weifu, from the People's Navy, continued: Only by building a strong and modern navy can we prevent the enemy from landing and sneaking in from the sea, smash the enemy's naval blockade, and develop maritime trade. However, the navy depends on heavy industry and various industries. He gave an example: In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's warship "Taiping" blockaded us along the coast of Zhejiang, constantly robbing fishing boats and merchant ships; however, with the development of the national economy, we have better ships, and as a result, we sank it. But we still need more powerful naval equipment to defend national security and safeguard peace, which can only be achieved by concentrating our efforts on the rapid development of industry. Delegate Liu Shanben, from the People's Air Force, said: The Air Force depends on heavy industry. Without a strong heavy industry base, it would be like letting the enemy's planes come and destroy our construction at will. Therefore, we fully support the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry in the Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. We will, together with the people of the whole country, practice strict economy to accumulate funds for the country, so as to rapidly develop industry.

The delegates unanimously stated that the People's Liberation Army has an even greater responsibility in realizing the First Five-Year Plan. The American imperialists are now using force to prevent us from liberating our own territory of Taiwan, and are threatening our country with war. Therefore, our army must work harder to improve its combat effectiveness, be constantly vigilant, and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of national security, and the safeguarding of peace.

    解放军出席全国人民代表大会会议的代表
    热烈拥护五年计划中优先发展重工业方针
    本报讯　出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的人民解放军代表们正在全神贯注地研究我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。他们对计划中优先发展重工业的方针表现出最高的热情。
    代表们纷纷以自己的切身体会说明优先发展重工业的必要性和正确性。来自祖国南方边疆的刘梅村代表说：有了重工业，不但可以促进轻工业迅速发展，可以用拖拉机等装备我国农业，用飞机、汽车等装备交通运输业，而且可以使国防获得强大的现代化装备的基础，大大地加强我国武装部队保卫祖国的力量。他根据切身的体会说：在解放海南岛时，我们是用木船渡海的。船出海以后不久，风停了。敌人的飞机又在空中骚扰。大家就用桨来划，在大海中一直划到天快亮才接近了海南岛。到登陆的时候，没有一个人手上没出血泡。假如有兵舰和登陆艇的话，几万人一会儿就到海南岛了，并且可以用舰上的炮火来掩护登陆。来自人民海军的王维福同志接着说，只有建设起一支强大的现代化的海军，才可以防止敌人从海上登陆偷渡，粉碎敌人的海上封锁，发展航海贸易。但是，海军是要依赖重工业和各种工业的。他举了一个例子说：在过去，蒋贼的太平号军舰在浙江沿海封锁我们，不断抢劫渔船商船；但是，随着国家经济建设的发展，我们有了更优良的舰艇，结果就把它击沉了。但是我们还需要更强大的海军装备来捍卫祖国安全，保卫和平，这就只有集中力量迅速发展工业才行。来自人民空军的代表刘善本说：空军是依赖重工业的。如果没有强大的重工业基础，那就等于让敌人的飞机随便来破坏我国的建设。因此我们完全拥护发展国民经济五年建设计划中优先发展重工业的方针。我们将和全国人民一道厉行节约，为国家积累资金，以便迅速发展工业。
    代表们一致表示，在实现第一个五年计划中，人民解放军的责任是更加重大的。美帝国主义者现在正用武力阻挠我们解放自己的领土台湾，并且用战争来威胁我国，因此我们军队就要更加努力地提高自己的战斗力，时刻提高警惕，为解放台湾，保卫祖国安全和保卫和平而坚决奋斗。
