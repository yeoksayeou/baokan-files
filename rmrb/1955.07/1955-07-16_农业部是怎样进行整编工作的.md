    How the Ministry of Agriculture is Carrying Out the Streamlining Work
    Guo Dequan, Yao Di
    In accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on streamlining, the Ministry of Agriculture has formulated a new staffing plan. According to this plan, the organization will be greatly simplified, and personnel will be reduced by 55.6 percent. This will not only save a large amount of administrative expenses and manpower, but also improve work style and increase work efficiency. More importantly, a group of technical and administrative personnel will be drawn out to supplement the local agricultural organizations.
    According to the new staffing plan, the first step is to overcome the shortcomings of overlapping work between the Ministry of Agriculture and local agricultural departments. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture already has a General Bureau of State Farms, which leads the work of state farms. However, the Northeast State Farms Administration Bureau is specifically set up in Heilongjiang Province to manage the work of state farms in the Northeast provinces. In fact, this Administration Bureau cannot specifically manage all the state farms in the Northeast, but only manages nine larger farms and several ranches. Among these nine farms, eight are in Heilongjiang Province, so the Northeast State Farms Administration Bureau actually replaces a large part of the work of the Heilongjiang Provincial State Farms Administration Bureau. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture has a Tropical Crops Department, and in the tropical crop production area, there is also the South China Reclamation Bureau, which specializes in managing state-owned tropical crop production enterprises. There is also some duplication of work in this respect. The above-mentioned situation not only duplicates organizations and wastes manpower, but more seriously, it is bound to affect the enthusiasm of local agricultural departments, which in turn will inevitably affect work. Therefore, the new staffing plan will abolish the Northeast State Farms Administration Bureau and hand over most of the work managed by this organization to local agricultural organizations. The Tropical Crops Department will be merged with the South China Reclamation Bureau to strengthen leadership over actual production work.
    Secondly, many overlapping organizations in the ministry will be abolished and merged. For example, although the Ministry of Agriculture's original establishment was nominally a three-level system, in fact, most of the sections (divisions) had groups under them. The increase in this level of organization only promoted bureaucracy and red tape in the agency and reduced work efficiency. According to the new work plan, all more than sixty groups under the sections (divisions) will be abolished, and all staff members will be directly commanded by the section chiefs or division chiefs. This will make it easier to use manpower rationally and flexibly to complete work tasks. For example, the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture originally had a Finance Section, which was responsible for the financial accounting work of various departments and bureaus. The Plant Protection Bureau, the General Bureau of State Farms, the General Bureau of Aquatic Products Management, the General Bureau of Land Utilization, and the Tropical Crops Department also have finance sections, divisions (groups) or full-time financial staff. In fact, these organizations and full-time staff members often have too many people and too little work. For example, the financial work of the Plant Protection Bureau could be completed by one person in half a day, but two full-time staff members were set up. According to the new staffing plan, based on actual needs, it was decided to abolish and merge the institutions and full-time staff in these departments and bureaus that manage financial work, and establish a Finance Department on the basis of the original Finance Section. This will reduce more than 30 financial accounting staff members. At the same time, due to the centralized management of financial accounting work, it can overcome the shortcomings of confusion, duplication, and delay in financial accounting work, and improve work efficiency.
    Finally, the disconnection between business work and mastering and researching materials is changed. In the past, eleven of the sixteen departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Agriculture had offices. The office staff did not directly undertake business work. In addition to being responsible for the safekeeping and distribution of documents, their main task was to assist the department and bureau chiefs and section chiefs in sorting out materials and drafting official documents and reports. This has resulted in two abnormal situations. One situation is that the office staff are not familiar with the business, and it is very difficult to sort out materials and draft official documents and reports. The section chiefs and department and bureau chiefs often do not do it themselves, so they often rework many times and still cannot improve the quality of official documents and reports. Another situation is that since there is such an organization specializing in sorting out materials, all materials, regardless of size or whether it is necessary, must be comprehensively sorted out, but rarely studied and used. This has also contributed to the growth and development of bureaucracy. According to the new staffing plan, all offices of departments and bureaus will be abolished, and only a few people will be retained to be responsible for safekeeping and distribution. As for sorting out materials and drafting official documents and reports, all departments will be responsible for them, and the important ones will be done by the section chiefs and department and bureau chiefs themselves. To this end, department, bureau, and section chiefs must also accumulate some important information themselves. This will not only strengthen the leadership of the department, bureau, and section chiefs in business, but also gradually overcome their bureaucratic work style.
    In addition, the logistical staff of the Ministry of Agriculture is also overstaffed. The ratio of logistical staff to general staff is 1 to 8.7. The division of labor for logistical staff is also too detailed. Offices, meeting rooms, corridors, and toilets are all managed by dedicated personnel. They work on average for less than half a day each day. According to the new plan, more than 100 logistical staff can be reduced. The young and strong will be transferred to work on state farms.
    At present, the Ministry of Agriculture is adjusting its organization and streamlining its personnel in accordance with the new staffing plan, and is transferring the transferred personnel to the posts where they are needed, and is striving to implement the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on streamlining, simplifying administration, and improving work.

    农业部是怎样进行整编工作的
    郭德全　姚堤
    农业部根据中央整编指示的精神，已经制定了新的编制方案。根据这个方案，机构将大大简化，人员将减少百分之五十五点六。这样，不但会节省大批行政费的开支，节省大批人力，还可以改进工作作风和提高工作效率。更重要的是，将抽出一批技术和行政工作人员充实到地方农业机构中去。
    按照新的编制方案，首先是克服了农业部同地方农业部门工作重复的缺点。例如，农业部已经有一个国营农场管理总局，领导国营农场的工作。但在黑龙江省又专门设有东北国营农场管理局，具体管理东北各省国营农场的工作。实际上，这个管理局也不可能把东北所有国营农场都具体地管起来，只是管了九个较大的农场和若干牧场。而这九个农场中就有八个在黑龙江省，这样，东北国营农场管理局实际上就代替黑龙江省国营农场管理局很大一部分工作。又如，农业部设有热带作物司，而在热带作物生产区，又设有专门管理国营热带作物生产企业的华南垦殖局，这在工作上，也有部分是重复的。像以上这种情形，不但机构重复，浪费人力，更严重的是势必影响地方农业部门工作的积极性，从而也就势必影响工作。因此新的编制方案中就要撤消东北国营农场管理局，把这个机构管理的绝大部分工作，交给地方农业机构管理。并将热带作物司同华南垦殖局合并，以加强对实际生产工作的领导。
      其次，在部里撤消和裁并不少重叠的机构。例如，农业部原来的编制名义上虽是三级制，实际上绝大部分处（科）以下都设有组，这层机构的增加，就更助长了机关的官僚主义和文牍主义，减低了工作效率。按照新的工作方案，把处（科）以下的六十多个组全部取消，所有工作人员都由处长或科长直接指挥，这就更便于合理地机动地使用人力，完成工作任务。又如，农业部的计划局本来设有财务处，专管各个司、局的财务会计工作。而植物保护局、国营农场管理总局、水产管理总局、土地利用总局以及热带作物司等也设有财务处、科（组）或专管财务的工作人员。实际上这些机构和专职工作人员往往是人多事少，如植物保护局的财务工作本来只要一个人半天的时间即可做完，但却设了两个专职工作人员。按照新的编制方案，从实际需要出发，决定把这些司、局管理财务工作的机构和专职工作人员予以裁并取消，在原来财务处的基础上，成立财务司，这样就可以减少三十多个财务会计工作人员，同时由于集中管理了财务会计工作，既可以克服财务会计工作中的混乱重复、迟缓等缺点，又可以提高工作效率。
    最后，改变业务工作和掌握、研究材料工作的脱节现象。过去，农业部十六个司局中就有十一个司、局设有办公室。办公室的工作人员并不直接负担业务工作，他们除了负责保管和收发文件外，主要工作是协助司、局长和处长整理材料，起草公文、报告等。这样就产生了两种不正常的情况。一种情况是，办公室的工作人员对业务不熟悉，整理材料，起草公文、报告等感到很吃力。而处长和司、局长往往不亲自动手，因此，往往多次返工，还不能提高公文和报告的质量。另一种情况是，既然有这样一个专门整理材料的机构，于是不管材料大小，也不管是否必要，都要综合、整理，却很少研究利用，这也就助长了文牍主义的滋长和发展。按照新的编制方案，所有司、局的办公室一律撤消，只留少数人担任保管和收发等工作。至于整理材料和起草公文、报告都归各处负责，重要的则由处长和司、局长亲自动手。为此，司、局、处长也要自己积累一部分重要资料。这样，不但可以加强司、局、处长对业务的领导，也可以逐步克服他们的官僚主义作风。
    此外，农业部的勤杂人员同样是人浮于事的，勤杂人员同一般工作人员的比例为一比八点七。勤杂人员的分工也过细，办公室、会议室、走廊、厕所，都有专人分工管理，他们每天平均工作的时间不到半天。按照新的方案，勤杂人员即可减少一百多人。其中年轻力壮的将被抽调到国营农场去工作。
    目前，农业部正在按照新的编制方案调整机构，精简人员，并把被抽调的人员输送到需要他们的岗位上去，为贯彻中央关于整编精简、改进工作指示的精神而努力。
