Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 12th: TASS is authorized to issue the following statement:

In view of the upcoming summit of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France in Geneva, some leading figures in the United States and the United Kingdom have recently made many statements on the German question. However, the matter is being presented as if the Soviet Union has "lost interest" in the unification of Germany, and as if it considers a unified Germany to be a threat to its own security.

Such remarks do not reflect the actual situation regarding the Soviet Union's attitude toward the German question.

Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has consistently placed the issue of German unification in the first place. In opposition to this is the plan to push the issue of German unification into second place, while placing the establishment of a West German army and dragging West Germany into the military blocs of Western countries in the first place.

What does it mean that the so-called Paris Accords, which stipulate the revival of West German militarism and its incorporation into the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have recently been ratified? Isn't it obvious that the member states of the accords have thus sacrificed the unification of Germany to the plans for reviving German militarism? This shows that the implementation of these plans hinders the restoration of German unification.

Whether Germany will continue to be divided into two parts, or whether the German nation will be united in a unified state, and whether the German people will have broad opportunities to display their creative power in peacefully developing their economy and their rich material and spiritual culture, now depends on the participants in the Paris Accords.

Some say that in order to restore German unification, it is sufficient in the current situation to reach an agreement on the technical issues of holding all-German elections. In this regard, they refer to the so-called "Eden Plan" put forward at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in January 1954. The procedural issues concerning the implementation of free all-German elections naturally have certain significance. However, in the new situation in Germany created by the entry into force of the Paris Accords, the question of whether West Germany will become a militarist state joining a military bloc, or whether measures will be taken to prevent West Germany from developing in this direction, is of decisive significance. The main issue of the cause of unified Germany and guaranteeing European security must not be secretly replaced by secondary procedural issues concerning the implementation of elections.

The Soviet Union was and remains in favor of the restoration of German unification. At the same time, the Soviet Union advocates properly considering the legitimate interests and rights of the German people, as well as guaranteeing the consolidation of European peace.

Some people insist that the difficulty of German unification is because the Soviet Union is "afraid" of a unified Germany.

In this regard, it is worth reminding that the Soviet Union and its heroic people fought against Hitler's Germany, which possessed almost all of Europe's industrial and military resources, and gloriously defended their freedom and independence. Now, the Soviet Union's efforts to safeguard peace and the security of all nations are converging with the efforts of many other peace-loving countries in Europe and Asia, and are receiving increasingly broad support from the people of the world, so it is even more capable of defending itself.

The Soviet Union opposes the revival of German militarism and the policy of making West Germany or a unified Germany participate in military blocs, not because it is afraid of a militarist unified Germany, but because such a policy would intensify the threat of a new war. Once a new war occurs, it will cause unprecedented and heavy sacrifices of life and material destruction. Due to the emergence of new types of large-scale destructive weapons that have never existed before—atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, rockets, etc.—in modern warfare, none of the participating countries can avoid enormous destruction and sacrifices. Moreover, probably no one would doubt that a new war would be the greatest danger for Germany. Germany will become the center of military operations, and the German people will suffer immeasurable hardships.

The solution of the German question is inextricably linked to guaranteeing the security of the whole of Europe. All European countries that strive to guarantee the conditions for their peaceful development see the problem in this way. If it is not possible to immediately reach an agreement on restoring German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis, then it is necessary to gradually complete this task on the path of easing international tensions. The establishment of an all-European collective security system with the participation of European countries with different social and state systems is in line with this goal.

The establishment of a European collective security system is no less in the interests of the German people than in the interests of other countries. Both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can participate in this security system. The rapprochement between these two countries is necessary to accelerate the restoration of German unification. It goes without saying that only a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany can occupy a well-deserved place in the family of peace-loving European peoples formed by the collective security system.

When talking about the future of Germany, it is usually not concealed that, according to the intentions of those who support the establishment of military blocs in Europe, a unified Germany should join the military blocs of Western countries. The Soviet Union, along with other peace-loving countries, cannot but take this into account. Here I would like to ask: If the Soviet Union were to make the solution of the German unification question conditional on whether the unified Germany participates in, say, the Warsaw Pact, then what would the Western countries do? There is no doubt that this would not be approved by the Western countries.

It is now generally recognized that the solution of outstanding international issues largely depends on whether international trust can be established and consolidated. This is directly related to both the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system, as well as to the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. These are the issues to which the people of all countries are paying the most attention.

The Four Powers bear a major responsibility to all nations to determine the fate of peace. Therefore, the leaders of these countries who will meet in Geneva have a responsibility to seek ways to solve outstanding problems in order to ease international tensions and consolidate peace.

As for the Soviet Union, as can be seen from its entire foreign policy, it will make every effort to promote the achievement of these goals.

### 塔斯社受权就德国问题发表声明

    塔斯社受权就德国问题发表声明
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：塔斯社受权发表声明如下：
    由于苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议即将在日内瓦举行，最近美国和英国的一些领导人物就德国问题发表了许多声明。但是事情被说成这样，似乎苏联对德国的统一“失去了兴趣”，似乎它认为统一的德国是对自己安全的威胁。
    这种言论在涉及苏联对德国问题的态度时没有反映实际情况。
    大家都知道，苏联始终不变地把德国统一问题放在第一位。同这点对立的是把德国统一问题推到第二位，而把建立西德军队和拖西德加入西方国家的军事集团这件事放在第一位的计划。
    规定复活西德军国主义和把它拖入西欧联盟及北大西洋集团的所谓巴黎协定最近批准了，这件事意味着什么呢？协定的成员国这样就使德国的统一作了复活德国军国主义计划的牺牲品，这难道不明显吗？这说明，这些计划的实现妨碍德国统一的恢复。
    德国将来还是仍然分裂为两部分，还是德意志民族将结合在一个统一的国家内，德意志人民将在和平发展他们的经济、他们的丰富的物质和精神文化方面，获得可以显示自己创造力量的广泛机会，现在就要看巴黎协定的参加者如何而定了。
    有人说，为了恢复德国的统一，在现在的情况下，仿佛只要就实行全德选举的技术问题取得协议就够了。在这方面他们提到在一九五四年一月举行的柏林四国外长会议上提出来的所谓“艾登计划”。有关实行全德自由选举的程序问题，自然具有一定的意义。但是，在由于巴黎协定生效而在德国形成的新局面下，关于西德是否会变成一个加入军事集团的军国主义国家，或者是否将采取措施以防止西德向这方面发展的问题，就具有决定性的意义了。决不能容许这个关于统一德国和保障欧洲安全事业的主要问题被次要的、关于实行选举的程序问题暗中偷换掉。
    苏联过去是，现在仍然是主张德国恢复统一的。同时，苏联主张妥善地考虑德国人民的合法利益和权利，以及保障欧洲和平的巩固。
    有一些人硬说，德国统一之所以困难，是因为苏联“害怕”统一的德国。
    在这方面，不妨提醒一下，苏联和它英勇的人民曾经对几乎拥有全欧洲的工业和军事资源的希特勒德国进行斗争，光荣地保卫了自己的自由和独立。现在苏联争取保障和平和各国人民安全的努力同欧洲和亚洲其他许多爱好和平国家的努力汇合了起来，并得到全世界人民越来越广泛的支持，因此，它就更加有能力保卫自己。
    苏联反对复活德国军国主义，反对使西德或者统一的德国参加军事集团的政策，这并不是因为它害怕军国主义的统一的德国，而是因为这种政策会使得新战争的威胁加强。而新战争一旦发生，就将会造成空前未有的惨重的生命牺牲和物质破坏。由于现在出现了以前从来不曾有过的新型的大规模毁灭性武器——原子武器、氢武器、火箭等等，在现代的战争中，参战的国家当然没有一个能够避免巨大的破坏和牺牲。而且，大概也没有人会怀疑，新战争对德国将是最大的危险。德国将成为军事行动的中心，德国人民将遭到难以计量的苦难。
    德国问题的解决是同保障整个欧洲的安全不可分割地联系着的。一切力求保障自己和平发展的条件的欧洲国家对这个问题都是这样看的。如果现在不能立刻达成关于在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一的协议，那就必须在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上逐步求得这个任务的完成。建立由不同社会和国家制度的欧洲国家参加的全欧集体安全体系，是符合这个目标的。
    欧洲集体安全体系的建立同德国人民的利害关系不在其他国家之下。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都可以参加这个安全体系。这两个国家的接近对加速恢复德国的统一是必要的。不用说，只有恢复统一、民主和爱好和平的德国，它才能在集体安全体系所结成的欧洲爱好和平人民的大家庭中占一个应得的地位。
    大家在谈到德国的未来时，通常都不掩饰这一点：按照拥护在欧洲建立军事集团的人们的意图，统一的德国应该加入西方国家的军事集团。苏联同其他爱好和平的国家都不能不考虑到这一点。这里要请问一下：如果苏联一定要使德国统一问题的解决决定于统一的德国是不是参加，譬如说，华沙条约，那末西方国家又将怎样办呢？可以毫不怀疑地说，这一点是不会得到西方国家的赞同的。
    现在大家都承认，要解决悬而未决的国际问题，在很大程度上决定于是否能确立和巩固国际间的信任。这无论是对德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系来说，或是对裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题来说都有直接的关系。现在各国人民最为注意的也就是这些问题。
    四大国对各国人民负有决定和平命运的重大责任。因此，将在日内瓦会谈的这些国家的领袖有责任寻求解决悬而未决的问题的途径，以利于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平。
    至于苏联，从它整个的外交政策上已可以看出，它将尽一切努力来促使达到这些目的。
