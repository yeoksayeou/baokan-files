It is well known that fortresses are most easily breached from within. Precisely for this reason, our class enemies are doing everything possible to try to worm their way into the Chinese Communist Party. This is the most insidious and vicious method by which the enemy sabotages our Party. Facts have proven that some of our class enemies, employing the tricks of disguise and deception, have indeed infiltrated our Party ranks. The fact that some counter-revolutionaries in the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have obtained the title of Communist Party member is clear evidence. Facts also prove that those who have infiltrated our Party are by no means limited to a few people in the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique; there are also other counter-revolutionaries, conspirators, class dissidents, opportunists, and other bad elements. In some places, the Party's grassroots organizations are completely controlled by counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. The Party branch of Chaganchaolao Village, Kulun First District, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, before it was announced dissolved and thoroughly rectified last year, was completely controlled by hooligans, bandits, reactionary secret society followers, and counter-revolutionaries who had massacred revolutionary cadres. The phenomenon of serious impurity in Party organizations even exists in individual Party leadership organs. The case of the CPC Hulin County Committee of Heilongjiang Province being usurped by Gao Jun, the former county Party secretary and a class dissident, and Xian Debi, the former deputy county Party secretary, is an example. Until this serious problem was exposed last October, the county Party committee had been under the control and manipulation of class dissidents for a long period, resulting in bad elements being given important positions and promoted, good cadres being discriminated against and attacked, some landlords taking back land and means of production from the hands of poor peasants, a quarter of the landlords and rich peasants openly participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives, and ninety-two percent of the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had been deprived of their civil rights having their civil rights restored in the general election.

These situations fully demonstrate that the enemy is stepping up its offensive against our revolutionary fortress and is intensifying its efforts to infiltrate the interior of the fortress to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. These situations also fully demonstrate that some of our Party organizations and some Communist Party members lack sufficient understanding of the increasingly fierce and acute class struggle during the transition period and have become complacent and careless, intoxicated by the victories already achieved by the revolution. Therefore, how to enhance revolutionary vigilance, how to fight against class enemies who attempt to infiltrate and have already infiltrated, further purify the Party ranks, and further enhance the Party's combat effectiveness has become an urgent task for all Party organizations and all Communist Party members.

First of all, all Party organizations and Communist Party members must treat the work of developing the Party with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and must conduct a strict review of the history and political background of every person applying to join the Party, especially those from exploiting class families and those who have participated in reactionary parties, groups, and secret societies. Only after proving that they have completely abandoned their original class stance, have indeed severed ties with reactionary organizations, and have made a sincere and unreserved confession to the Party, can they be accepted into the Party in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution. The practice of only valuing current performance and not valuing the thorough investigation of history is incompatible with the seriousness of our Party. Because, for some class enemies who are trying to worm their way into our Party, clarifying their history is one of the keys to identifying them. The responsibility of Party organizations is not to be deceived by the disguise of class enemies, but to be good at stripping off their disguise by reviewing their history, so as to reveal their true colors. An important method of reviewing history is verification. Although some Party organizations have also conducted so-called reviews of the history of applicants for Party membership, they have not taken the history narrated by the applicants to the local Party organizations and the masses to seek proof, but have easily believed the applicants' narrations. For example, the Materials Section Branch of the Jiaohe Mining Bureau in Jilin Province did not verify the history narrated by the two Party members it developed last year, but easily believed them; as a result, not long after they joined the Party, the public security organs arrested them because they were escaped counter-revolutionaries who had conspired to kill three revolutionary workers and had changed their names and fled from their original Shandong hometown to the Northeast during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. The history they narrated was almost entirely fabricated.

In the work of developing the Party, we must adhere to the standards of Communist Party members, and we must strictly follow the procedures for joining the Party. Failure to do so will not only fail to guarantee the quality of Communist Party members but will also open the door for class enemies to infiltrate the Party. The reason why our Party individually accepts activists into the Party only after a long period of education and observation, and why strict procedures for joining the Party must be followed when joining the Party, is, on the one hand, to raise activists to the level of Communist Party members, and on the other hand, to prevent class enemies from worming their way into our Party. However, the current phenomenon that some Party organizations do not pay attention to the quality of Party members and do not accept Party members in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution in the work of developing the Party is serious. The situation of developing Party members in the Fourth District of Yichang County, Hubei Province last year is a typical example. This district developed eighty-nine Party members in one batch last August. None of these eighty-nine Party members was discussed and approved by the general membership meeting of the branch, but was determined, discussed, and approved by the District Committee based on the so-called list of activists. Most Party members only found introducers to the Party temporarily in order to fill out the forms and take the oath, and some individual Party members still do not know who their introducers to the Party are. As a result, thirty-eight of these eighty-nine Party members did not meet the standards of Party members, and more seriously, counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, and elements with serious political problems in their history accounted for ten. Lu Yuan, a backbone element of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, after using all kinds of disguise and deception to worm his way into our Party, wrote to Hu Feng and reported: "This process is really a struggle for us." Look, how much do counter-revolutionaries value and seriously take the matter of infiltrating the Party, regarding it as a struggle. And what about some of our Party organizations? Instead of regarding the work of developing the Party as a struggle, as a struggle against all class enemies who attempt to infiltrate the Party, they treat it casually and carelessly. Can this phenomenon continue to be tolerated?

Secondly, strengthening the education and observation of probationary Party members is an important task that must be paid attention to in the current Party building. The purpose of this education and observation is not only to gradually improve the communist consciousness of probationary Party members, so that probationary Party members gradually reach the standards of formal Party members and strive to become full members on schedule, but more importantly, to use the probationary period to further examine whether this probationary Party member is loyal to the cause of the Party. Article 7 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates: "The role of the probationary period for probationary Party members is to enable probationers to receive preliminary Party education and to ensure that Party organizations observe the political qualities of probationers in their work." This means that the probationary period is an important test for probationary Party members to see if they can be a Communist Party member. If political problems are found in the observation of probationary Party members during the probationary period, the Party organization can cancel their probationary Party member status at any time. All Party organizations should understand the spirit of this article of the Party Constitution and implement the provisions of this article in the work of developing the Party. The currently widespread deviation of only developing without paying attention to education and observation is contrary to the requirements of purifying the Party organization. The result of relaxing education and observation of probationary Party members, in addition to making it impossible for some probationary Party members to become full members on schedule, or even if they do become full members, the quality of Party members cannot be guaranteed, it may also allow class enemies who have obtained the qualifications of probationary Party members to smoothly infiltrate the Party. Facts have proved that examining the political qualities of probationary Party members is very important to prevent class enemies from infiltrating the Party. The CPC Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation Highway Bureau's recent removal of Feng Diancheng, a class dissident who had fraudulently obtained the qualifications of probationary Party member, from the Party is a good proof. After Feng Diancheng infiltrated the revolutionary ranks in 1949, he consistently disguised himself as active in his work, and had always been trusted by the Party and the masses, and fraudulently obtained the title of "Meritorious Official". He was accepted into the Party in December 1954. Before joining the Party, the relevant Party organization had also sent people to his hometown to investigate his history, but because they did not go deep among the masses, they did not find any problems. After joining the Party, the Party organization continued to investigate his history, and found that he was a rich peasant element who had organized landlords to carry out counter-settlements against poor and lower-middle peasants, and was also the murderer who personally participated in the live burial of three revolutionary comrades. Thus, the Party organization immediately expelled him from the Party, and the conspiracy of this class dissident who had been mixing in the revolutionary ranks for five or six years and tried to worm his way into the Party did not achieve its purpose.

Then, does it mean that as long as the history of applicants for Party membership is strictly reviewed, as long as the standards of Communist Party members are adhered to, and as long as education and observation are carried out on probationary Party members, class enemies will not be able to mix into the Party? It is not like this. Because, with the development of class struggle, the disguise of class enemies will become more clever, their activities will become more concealed, and it will be more difficult for us to identify them. Secondly, although our work of developing the Party will definitely be greatly improved, it is impossible not to have any negligence and errors, and all negligence and errors may become loopholes for class enemies to mix in. Moreover, class struggle will inevitably be reflected in our Party, and some unswerving and unreliable elements in our Party will also be influenced and utilized by the bourgeoisie and even embark on the road of betraying the Party and betraying the revolution. Therefore, it is a naive idea that does not understand the laws of class struggle to think that as long as we improve our revolutionary vigilance, class enemies will no longer be able to mix into the Party. Therefore, all Party organizations must strengthen the supervision of all Party members from top to bottom and from bottom to top, in accordance with the resolution of the National Party Congress in March this year. This supervision can not only help Communist Party members overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes at any time, but also timely discover the activities of class enemies who have mixed into the Party and timely discover degenerated elements in the Party. All Party organizations must observe and handle all major issues in the Party from the perspective of class struggle, and must never adopt an attitude of complacency and bureaucracy. Fu Wentan, who was recently expelled from the Party, was an alternate member of the former CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and secretary of the CPC First District Committee of Tianjin. He was a class dissident who had mixed into the Party for a long time. Since the "Three-Anti" Movement in 1951, cadres and the masses have continuously exposed Fu Wentan's mistakes of colluding with counter-revolutionaries, embezzling and accepting bribes, engaging in speculation and profiteering, and corruption and degeneration. However, as a result of bureaucracy and complacency, the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee blindly trusted this "old Party member" and "old cadre" to such an extent that not only did it fail to conduct in-depth investigations and serious handling based on the exposures of cadres and the masses, but instead nominated Fu Wentan as a candidate for member of the Municipal Committee at the First Party Congress of the CPC Tianjin Municipality last year. This fact shows how dangerous it is for Party organizations to lose revolutionary vigilance, and how dangerous it is for Party organizations not to implement strict supervision of all Party members, including those responsible old Party members!

Our country's developing socialist construction and socialist transformation cause require the Party to continuously strengthen its leadership. This means that continuing to develop and strengthen the Party organization is still an important task of the Party in the future. Actively developing Party members, while not allowing class enemies to mix into the Party, continuously purifying the Party organization, and eliminating class enemies who have mixed in and degenerated elements in the Party, this is the principle that the whole Party must strictly abide by in the task of developing the Party and consolidating the Party.

### 严防阶级敌人混入党内

    严防阶级敌人混入党内
    人所共知，堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。正因为这样，我们的阶级敌人就千方百计地企图钻到中国共产党内来。这是敌人破坏我们党的最阴险最毒辣的一种手段。事实证明，我们的有些阶级敌人运用伪装和欺骗的伎俩，的确钻到我们党的队伍中来了，胡风反革命集团中的一些反革命分子取得了共产党员的称号，就是明显的证据。事实同时证明，钻到我们党内来的绝不限于胡风反革命集团中的一些人，还有其他反革命分子、阴谋家、阶级异己分子、投机分子等等坏分子。有的地方，党的基层组织完全被反革命分子和坏分子所操纵。内蒙古自治区库伦一区查杆朝老台村的党支部，在去年被宣布解散和彻底整顿以前就完全被流氓、盗匪、反动会道门道徒以及屠杀过革命干部的反革命分子所掌握。党组织严重不纯的现象，甚至在个别党的领导机关中也存在着，中共黑龙江省虎林县委会被阶级异己分子前任县委书记高军和前任县委副书记线德璧所篡夺就是例证。直到去年十月这一严重问题被揭发以前，这个县委会在一个长期间一直在阶级异己分子的操纵和把持之下，致使坏分子得到重用和提拔，好干部受到歧视和打击，有些地主又从贫农手中夺去了土地和生产资料，四分之一的地主富农公开参加了农业生产合作社，百分之九十二被褫夺了公民权的地主、富农和反革命分子在普选中又恢复了公民权。
    这些情况充分说明，敌人正在加紧向我们的革命堡垒进攻，并加紧钻入堡垒内部来进行反革命破坏活动。这些情况也充分说明，我们某些党组织和某些共产党员对过渡时期阶级斗争将日趋激烈和尖锐的形势缺乏足够的认识，被革命已经取得的胜利所陶醉，变得麻痹大意起来。因此，如何提高革命警惕性，如何同企图混入和已经混入的阶级敌人进行斗争，进一步纯洁党的队伍，进一步提高党的战斗力，就成为所有党组织和全体共产党员迫切的任务。
    首先，所有党组织和共产党员必须用高度的革命警惕性来对待发展党的工作，必须对每一个申请入党的人的历史和政治面貌进行严格审查，特别是对那些出身于剥削阶级家庭的人和参加过反动党团会道门的人，尤其需要严格的审查。只有证明他们完全抛弃了自己原有的阶级立场，确实断绝了和反动组织的联系，并且向党作了毫无保留的真诚交代之后，才能按照党章规定的手续，接收他们入党。那种只看重现在的表现，而不看重查清历史的作法，是同我们党的严肃性不相容的。因为，对于一些企图钻到我们党内来的阶级敌人来说，查清他们的历史是识别他们的关键之一。党组织的责任，就是不要被阶级敌人的伪装所迷惑，要善于经过审查他们的历史，剥去他们的伪装，使他们显出原形来。审查历史的重要方法是对证。有些党组织对申请入党者的历史虽然也作了所谓审查，但他们不是把本人叙述的历史拿到当地党组织和群众中去寻求证明，而是轻易相信本人的叙述。比如吉林省蛟河矿务局材料科支部去年发展的两名党员就没有对他们叙述的历史进行对证，而轻易相信了他们；结果在他们入党之后不久，公安机关就逮捕了他们，因为他们是合谋残杀过三名革命工作人员的漏网反革命分子，在镇压反革命运动中隐姓埋名，从山东原籍潜逃到东北来的。他们本人所叙述的历史几乎全部是伪造。
    在发展党的工作中，必须坚持共产党员的标准，必须严格履行入党手续，不这样，不但不能保证共产党员的质量，同时也会给阶级敌人混入党内开了方便之门。我们党所以要对积极分子作长期的教育和考察之后才个别地接受他们入党，以及在入党时必须履行严格的入党手续，一方面是为了把积极分子提高到共产党员的水平，另一方面也是为了防止阶级敌人钻到我们党内来。而目前某些党组织在发展党的工作中不注意党员的质量，不按照党章的规定接收党员的现象是严重的。湖北省宜昌县第四区去年发展党员的情况就是一个典型例子。这个区去年八月一批就发展了八十九名党员，这八十九名党员全部没有经过支部党员大会的讨论通过，而是由区委会根据所谓积极分子名单圈定、讨论和批准的，多数党员为了填表和宣誓临时才找入党介绍人，还有个别党员直到现在都不知道谁是他的入党介绍人。结果，这八十九名党员中就有三十八名够不上党员标准，更严重的是反革命分子、阶级异己分子，以及历史上有严重政治问题的分子就占了十名。胡风反革命集团中的骨干分子绿原，在耍尽了伪装和欺骗的手段钻进我们党内以后，给胡风写信报告说：“这个过程对于我们实在是一场斗争。”请看，反革命分子对他们打入党内这件事是如何重视和认真，把这看作一场斗争，而我们有些党组织呢？倒反而不是把发展党的工作看作一场斗争，看作同一切企图混入党内的阶级敌人的一场斗争，而是随随便便，漫不经心。这种现象还能继续容忍吗？
    其次，加强对候补党员的教育和考察是目前党的建设中必须加以注意的一项重要工作。这种教育和考察的目的，不仅仅在于逐步提高候补党员的共产主义觉悟，使候补党员逐步达到正式党员的标准，争取按期转正，更重要的是利用候补期间来进一步考察这个候补党员是否忠于党的事业。中国共产党党章第七条规定：“候补党员候补期的作用，是使候补人接受初步的党的教育，并在工作中保证党的组织考察候补人的政治品质。”这就是说，候补期是对候补党员能否作一个共产党员的重要考验，如果在候补期的考察中发现候补党员有政治问题，党组织即可随时取消其候补党员的资格。所有党组织都应当领会党章这一条的精神，并在发展党的工作中贯彻这一条的规定。目前大量存在的只管发展，不管教育和考察的偏向，对纯洁党的组织的要求是相违背的。对候补党员放松教育和考察的结果，除去使得部分候补党员不能按期转正，或者即使转正了也不能保证党员的质量，还可能使取得候补党员资格的阶级敌人畅通无阻地钻到党内来。事实证明，考察候补党员的政治品质对防止阶级敌人混入党内是十分重要的。中共山东省交通厅公路局委员会，不久之前把骗得候补党员资格的阶级异己分子冯殿成清除出党，就是很好的证明。冯殿成在一九四九年混入革命队伍以后，工作上一贯伪装积极，一直得到党和群众的信任，并且骗得了“功臣”称号，于一九五四年十二月被接受入党。入党之前，有关的党组织也曾派人到他的家乡对他的历史作过考察，但由于没有深入群众，并未发现问题。入党之后，党组织对他的历史继续进行考察，结果发现他是曾经组织地主向贫雇农实行倒算的富农分子，并且是亲自参与活埋三名革命同志的凶手。这样，党组织就立即把他清除出党，这个在革命队伍中混了五、六年又企图钻入党内的阶级异己分子的阴谋没有达到目的。
    那末，是不是说只要严格审查了申请入党者的历史，只要坚持了入党者的共产党员的标准，只要对候补党员作了教育和考察，党内就不会混进来阶级敌人了呢？不是这样。因为，随着阶级斗争的发展，阶级敌人的伪装会更加巧妙，活动会更加隐蔽，我们要辨别他们也会更加困难的。其次，我们发展党的工作虽然一定会大有改进，但不可能就没有疏忽和错误，而所有的疏忽和错误，都可能成为阶级敌人混进来的漏洞。还有，阶级斗争必然会在我们党内得到反映，我们党内的某些不坚定不可靠的分子也会受到资产阶级的影响和利用以至走上背叛党和背叛革命的道路。所以，认为只要我们提高了革命警惕，党内就不可能再混进来阶级敌人，这是一种不懂得阶级斗争规律的天真想法。因此，所有党组织，必须根据今年三月全国党代表会议的决议，加强对全体党员自上而下和自下而上相结合的监督。这种监督，不仅能够随时帮助共产党员克服缺点纠正错误，同时也可以及时发现混入党内的阶级敌人的活动和及时发现党内的蜕化变质分子。所有党组织必须用阶级斗争的观点来观察和处理党内的一切重大问题，绝对不能采取麻痹大意和官僚主义的态度。最近被开除党籍的傅文坛，是前中共天津市委员会候补委员，天津市一区区委书记，他是一个长期混入党内的阶级异己分子，自从一九五一年的“三反”运动以来，干部和群众就对傅文坛的勾结反革命、贪污受贿、投机倒把、腐化堕落等错误不断有所揭发。可是，中共天津市委会由于官僚主义和麻痹大意的结果，对这个“老党员”“老干部”的盲目信任到了这种程度：不但没有根据干部和群众的揭发去作深入调查和严肃处理，反而在去年中共天津市第一次党代表大会上把傅文坛提名为市委委员的候选人。这个事实表明，党组织要是丧失了革命警惕性是多么危险，党组织要是不对全体党员包括那些负责的老的党员实行严格的监督是多么危险！
    我国正在发展着的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业要求党不断加强领导。这就是说，继续发展和壮大党的组织还是今后党的一项重要工作。积极地发展党员，又不让阶级敌人混入党内，不断纯洁党的组织，把混进来的阶级敌人和党内的蜕化变质分子清除出去，这就是全党在发展党和巩固党的任务中所必须严格遵守的原则。
