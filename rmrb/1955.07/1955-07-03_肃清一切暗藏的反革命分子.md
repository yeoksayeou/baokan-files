The exposure of the true face and criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people and heightened their vigilance against the activities of hidden counter-revolutionaries. The masses of the people are demanding the elimination of all hidden counter-revolutionaries, which is entirely correct.

The main characteristic of Hu Feng and his group is that they adopted the double-dealing tactics of Trotskyites and other counter-revolutionaries, cleverly disguising themselves as Marxists, revolutionaries, and supporters of the Communist Party, as friends of the people, especially young people, in order to confuse the Party and the people and blind their eyes. For more than twenty years, they have been painstakingly trying to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, even the Communist Party, to sabotage the people's revolution and socialist cause from within, to destroy the Communist Party, and to serve imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang bandit gang.

It is not only the Hu Feng clique that pretends to be progressive and revolutionary, infiltrating the revolutionary camp and the Communist Party to sabotage the revolution, but also the secret agents sent by imperialist spy agencies; as well as various types of agents from the Kuomintang's "Internal Investigation Bureau," "Bureau of Secrecy," and "Mainland Work Office," and also ordinary reactionary officers, reactionary party and league backbone elements, reactionary gang leaders, and the reactionary organizations they organize. Such hidden counter-revolutionaries exist in financial and economic circles, political and legal circles, cultural and educational circles, and in all parties and groups. These elements may not be able to recite as many Marxist phrases as the Hu Feng elements, and they may not be able to write poetry or articles, but they are also superficially "going along with" the revolution, praising the revolution, flattering the revolution, and even pretending to be diligent and hardworking after infiltrating revolutionary organizations, in order to gain trust, which is similar to the Hu Feng elements. The real purpose of these hidden counter-revolutionaries is to find our weaknesses, exploit loopholes, steal our Party and state secrets, and provide imperialism and the Kuomintang with information about our military, political, and economic affairs; or to spread rumors, incite the masses, and create disputes; or to directly engage in destructive activities such as arson, explosions, assassinations, and riots.

It should be pointed out that since the victory of the Chinese revolution, adopting double-dealing tactics to carry out covert struggles against us has become the main strategy for counter-revolutionaries to carry out their activities. They adopt this tactic because they see that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have unlimited prestige among the people. The people's democratic dictatorship is very consolidated, and anyone who openly and directly opposes the Communist Party and the people's regime will be severely打击 (dǎjī - struck down) by the broad masses. Therefore, they adopt covert methods of struggle, concealing their hideous and hateful true face, and secretly carrying out destructive activities. Such hidden counter-revolutionaries are the most dangerous enemies of the revolution.

The suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951 eliminated a large part of the open and exposed counter-revolutionaries, which was a great victory. However, there is still a considerable portion of such open and exposed counter-revolutionaries that have not been eliminated. As for the large number of hidden counter-revolutionaries who adopt double-dealing tactics, we have not yet had time to carry out resolute exposure and handling. On the contrary, they have deceived us with various disguises and infiltrated our "livers." The reason why they were able to infiltrate and hide for a long time is because our organs, groups, enterprises, troops, schools, and cooperatives lacked strict examination when receiving personnel; also because we are the victors, and all kinds of people are approaching us, among whom some counter-revolutionaries inevitably混进 (hùnjìn - sneak in), and we have not yet had time to conduct a thorough clearing; also because hidden counter-revolutionaries adopt double-dealing deceptive means, and if we want to identify and clear them, we must rely on the correct guidance of the leading organs and the high consciousness of the broad masses, which our past work in this area has been lacking. Many of our people are not vigilant enough against hidden counter-revolutionaries, and many have simply lost their vigilance. Some people think that "the regime is in our hands, and a few counter-revolutionaries don't matter," "scholars who rebel won't succeed in three years, a few small fish can't make big waves, no need to make a fuss about it"; some people think that "business is too busy, doing a good job is politics"; and some people think that "counter-revolutionaries are elsewhere, not in my department." These people forget that if the counter-revolutionaries' conspiracy succeeds, it will be a counter-revolutionary restoration, it will be China going backwards for decades, and it will be the heads of millions of revolutionaries falling to the ground. Tolerance of counter-revolutionaries is like raising tigers to eat oneself. It is precisely because many people have these extremely dangerous right-leaning ideas that many of our departments have adopted the "rather be right than left" approach in Party struggles, ideological struggles, cadre work, and personnel work. This has made many people in our ranks lose their political vigilance, unable to distinguish hidden counter-revolutionaries, and many people have been sleeping with tigers for a long time without knowing it, or they have clearly discovered counter-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary ideas but dare not carry out resolute struggles. This is the main danger and the main deviation in the revolutionary ranks today.

Under the control of this right-leaning thought of underestimating the enemy and 麻痹 (mábì - complacency), many comrades now hear counter-revolutionary rumors and do not care, find accidents and do not investigate,逃跑 (táopǎo - escaped) prisoners and controlled elements and do not pursue them, the masses come to report counter-revolutionary activities and ignore them, and even major cases occur and they do not actively侦察 (zhēnchá - investigate) and solve them. Hidden counter-revolutionaries see an opportunity to take advantage of it and step up their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Among the large and small accidents that occurred in the economic enterprise system in 1954, more than 340 have been found to be counter-revolutionary sabotage accidents, and the number that has not been found is much larger than this number. There are also many cases of rural counter-revolutionaries setting fire to granaries, forests, and agricultural production cooperative property, and carrying out homicide and murder. Can these shocking facts still be ignored?

The enemy is bound to come to sabotage our socialist construction and socialist transformation, and is bound to try to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration and subvert the people's democratic regime. However, as long as our vast number of cadres and the masses become vigilant and pay attention at all times and in all places, these hidden enemies can all be discovered and eliminated. We are fully confident that although the number of counter-revolutionaries is not small, and although they are very狡猾 (jiǎohuá - cunning), they are ultimately an absolute minority. In our current Party and government organs, groups, factories, mines, schools, troops, and cooperatives, all personnel, including uprising personnel and retained personnel, the vast majority of people, that is, more than 90 percent of the people, are good people. Among them, some people have mistakes and shortcomings, but they still belong to the category of good people. As long as these more than 90 percent of good people keep their eyes open, as long as they understand the schemes and dangers of hidden counter-revolutionaries, as long as they closely combine with the public security departments and the cadre work and personnel work departments to fight against counter-revolutionaries, they will surely be able to eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is proof of this.

The current urgent task is to conduct extensive and in-depth education in all our organs, groups, enterprises, troops, schools, cooperatives, and even the vast masses of people in urban and rural areas through the Hu Feng incident. This is one of the fundamental keys to the smooth development of the struggle to eliminate hidden enemies. The responsible comrades of each unit should personally make reports and organize the reading of documents and discussions. The discussion should be closely linked to reality, linked to how hidden enemies can carry out sabotage activities on their own front, in their own department, and in their own area, and even infiltrate our "livers." Everyone should understand that hidden enemies will not only put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to spread reactionary ideas, will pretend to be diligent and hardworking to gain trust, in order to搗鬼 (dǎoguǐ - play tricks) behind their backs; but will also fabricate history, forge Party introduction letters, forge documents and medals, and infiltrate our ranks. Everyone should understand that our 麻痹 (mábì - complacency), liberalism, and individualism may be exploited by the enemy. Among the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, it is necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda and education through already solved counter-revolutionary cases with typical educational significance, so that the masses understand the various schemes and destructive means of the enemy, understand how to identify hidden counter-revolutionaries, actively揭发 (jiēfā - expose) and assist the public security organs in capturing these counter-revolutionaries, and protect their own revolutionary achievements and socialist future. The more extensive and in-depth this education work is done, the brighter the eyes of the masses are, the more 麻痹 (mábì - complacency) can be overcome, the easier it is to expose hidden counter-revolutionaries, and the more guarantee there is to realize the policy of raising vigilance, eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, preventing deviations, and not wronging a single good person.

Eliminating counter-revolutionaries is a task that the entire Party and the people of the country must pay close attention to. The people of the whole country must deeply accept the lessons of the Hu Feng incident and other counter-revolutionary sabotage incidents. All organs, groups, enterprises, troops, schools, and cooperatives must strictly and improve the review system when accepting personnel, and Party organizations must especially strictly and improve the system of accepting new Party members, to prevent any counter-revolutionaries from mixing in; at the same time, it is necessary to adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses to thoroughly 清理 (qīnglǐ - screen) those people whose origins are unknown or whose behavior is suspicious. It is necessary to strictly distinguish between good people and bad people. The mistakes and shortcomings of some good people of a general nature that can be corrected cannot be confused with the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries. But for hidden counter-revolutionaries, we cannot relax in the slightest, and we cannot let them use double-dealing tactics such as false self-criticism, false repentance, and避重就轻 (bìzhòngjiùqīng - dwelling on the trivial and glossing over the important) to muddle through. In factories and mines, it is necessary to strengthen security work, and for all kinds of accidents, we must be determined to thoroughly investigate the details, so that counter-revolutionaries cannot carry out sabotage under the cover of natural accidents and responsibility accidents. In cities and villages, for arson, assassination, explosions, and various incidents that sabotage unified purchase and sales and mutual assistance and cooperation, we must vigorously organize侦察 (zhēnchá - investigation), and at the same time mobilize the broad masses to cooperate in solving cases. Public security organs and mass-based public security committees should actively strengthen the struggle against the enemy, and clear up various hidden counter-revolutionaries in their jurisdictions in an organized and planned manner. In short, the people of the whole country must unite as one, work together, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and not let one escape!

### 肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子

　　肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子
    胡风反革命集团的真实面目和罪恶活动的揭露，激起了广大人民的愤怒，同时也提高了广大人民对于暗藏的反革命分子活动的警惕。人民群众纷纷要求肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，这是完全正确的。
    胡风和胡风集团分子的主要特点，是他们采取了托洛茨基分子和其他反革命分子的两面派的手法，把自己巧妙地伪装成马克思主义者、革命者和共产党的拥护者，伪装成人民的朋友，尤其是青年人的朋友，借以迷惑党和人民，蒙蔽党和人民的眼睛。他们二十多年来处心积虑钻入革命队伍以至共产党内，从内部来破坏人民革命和社会主义事业，破坏共产党，为帝国主义和蒋介石国民党匪帮效劳。
    伪装进步和革命、钻入革命阵营和共产党内来破坏革命的不只有胡风集团，而且还有帝国主义特务机关所派遣来的特务；还有国民党“内调局”、
  “保密局”、“大陆工作处”的各式各类的特务，也有一般的反动军官、反动党团骨干、反动道首和他们所组织的反动组织。这样的暗藏的反革命分子无论在财政经济界、政治法律界、文化教育界和各党派、各团体中都有。这些分子不一定能像胡风分子们那样背诵许多马克思主义的词句，不一定会做诗会写文章，但他们也是在表面上“顺着”革命，称赞革命，阿谀革命，甚至在钻入了革命组织以后装得勤劳刻苦，以图骗取信任，却是同胡风分子相似的。这些暗藏的反革命分子的真正目的，都在找我们的弱点、钻空子，偷窃我们党和国家的机密，向帝国主义和国民党供给有关我们的军事、政治和经济的情报；或者散布谣言，煽动群众，制造纠纷；或者直接进行纵火、爆破、暗杀、暴动之类的破坏活动。
    应当指出，从中国革命胜利以后，采取两面派手段来对我们进行隐蔽的斗争，已经成为反革命分子进行活动的主要策略。他们所以采取这种策略，是因为他们看到中国共产党和人民政府在人民群众中具有无限的威信。人民民主专政是十分巩固的，谁要公开地正面地起来反对共产党和人民政权，谁就会遭到广大群众的沉重的打击。因此，他们就采取隐蔽的斗争方式，把自己那副反人民的狰狞可恶的真实面目遮盖起来，暗中进行破坏活动。这种暗藏的反革命分子是革命的最危险的敌人。
    一九五一年的镇压反革命运动把一个很大部分的公开和暴露的反革命分子肃清了，这是一个伟大的胜利。但是，这种公开的暴露的反革命分子也还有一个不小的部分没有肃清。至于大批的采取两面派手法的暗藏的反革命分子，则我们还没有来得及实行坚决的揭露和处理。相反的，他们却用各种伪装欺骗了我们，钻进我们的“肝脏里”来了。他们所以能够钻了进来并且长久地暗藏起来，这是因为我们的机关、团体、企业、部队、学校、合作社在接收人员的时候，缺乏严格的审查；也因为我们是胜利者，各种各样的人都向我们靠拢，其中不免混进一些反革命分子，而我们还没有来得及作彻底的清理；还因为暗藏的反革命分子采取了两面派的欺骗手段，我们要想辨别和清理他们，就必须依靠领导机关的正确指导和广大群众的高度觉悟相结合才能办到，而我们过去在这方面的工作是有缺点的。我们的很多人对暗藏的反革命分子的警惕性不高，许多人简直丧失了警惕性。有的人认为“政权在我们手里，有几个反革命分子也不要紧”，“秀才造反三年不成，几条小鱼翻不起大浪，不必小题大作”；有的人认为“业务太忙，搞好业务就是政治”；还有的人认为“反革命分子在别处有，在我这个部门是没有的”。这些人忘记了，如果让反革命分子的阴谋得到成功，那就是反革命的复辟，那就是中国倒退几十年，那就是千百万革命者人头落地。对反革命的宽容，就是养起老虎来吃掉自己。正是因为不少人有这些极端危险的右倾思想，才使得我们不少部门在党内斗争、思想斗争、干部工作和人事工作方面采取了“宁右勿左”的作法。这就使得我们队伍中许多人丧失了政治警惕性，不能辨别暗藏的反革命分子，使很多人长期和老虎睡在一起还不知道，或者明明发现了反革命分子和反革命思想也不敢进行坚决的斗争。这是目前革命队伍中的主要危险和主要偏向。
    在这种轻敌麻痹的右倾思想支配之下，现在有许多同志听到反革命谣言不过问，发现了事故不追查，在押罪犯和被管制分子跑了不追究，群众来报告反革命活动不理睬，甚至发生了重大案件也不积极侦察破案。暗藏的反革命分子看到有机可乘，就加紧了反革命的破坏活动。一九五四年经济企业系统发生的大小事故中，已查清为反革命破坏事故的有三百四十多起，没有查清的比这个数目还要多得多。农村反革命分子纵火焚烧粮仓、森林和农业生产合作社财产，进行凶杀谋害的案件为数也很多。这种惊心动魄的事实，难道还可以视若无睹么？
    敌人是一定要来破坏我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业的，是一定要来企图实行反革命的复辟，颠覆人民民主政权的。可是，只要我们广大的干部和群众警惕起来，随时随地注意起来，这些暗藏的敌人就都是可以被发现和清除的。我们完全相信，反革命分子虽然数量不少，虽然非常狡猾，但是他们究竟是绝对的少数。我们现在的党政军民各机关、团体、厂矿、学校、部队、合作社中，所有人员，包括起义人员，留用人员在内，绝大多数的人，即百分之九十几的人，都是好人。他们之中，有一些人是有错误和缺点的，但他们还是属于好人一类。只要这百分之九十几的好人眼睛擦亮了，只要他们懂得暗藏的反革命分子的阴谋手段和危害性，只要他们同公安部门，同干部工作、人事工作部门密切结合起来，向反革命分子进行斗争，就一定可以肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，就是一个证明。
    当前的迫切任务就是要通过胡风事件，在所有我们的机关、团体、企业、部队、学校和合作社以至城乡的广大人民群众中进行广泛深入的教育。这是肃清暗藏敌人的斗争顺利开展的根本关键之一。各单位的负责同志要亲自动手作报告，组织阅读文件和讨论。讨论要密切联系实际，联系到暗藏的敌人可以怎样在自己这条战线上、在自己这个部门中和在自己这个地区内进行破坏活动，以至钻进“肝脏里”来。应当使每一个人了解：暗藏的敌人不但会披上马克思列宁主义的外衣来散布反动思想，会装作勤劳刻苦的样子来骗取信任，以便背后捣鬼；而且还会假造历史，假造党的介绍信，假造文件和勋章，钻进我们队伍里来。应当使每一个人了解：我们的麻痹大意、自由主义和个人主义等缺点错误，都可能受到敌人利用。在广大城乡群众中，则必须通过已经破获的具有典型教育意义的反革命案件，进行深入的宣传教育，使群众了解敌人的各种阴谋破坏手段，懂得怎样识别暗藏的反革命分子，积极起来揭发并协助公安机关捕捉这些反革命分子，保护自己的革命果实和社会主义前途。这种教育工作做得越广泛，越深入，群众的眼睛擦得越亮，越能克服麻痹大意，就越容易揭露暗藏的反革命分子，就越有保证实现提高警惕，肃清一切反革命分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人的方针。
    肃清反革命分子，是全党和全国人民必须人人加以密切关心的工作。全国人民都必须深刻地接受胡风事件和其他反革命破坏事件的教训。各个机关、团体、企业、部队、学校和合作社都必须把接受人员时的审查制度严格起来和健全起来，党组织尤其要把接受新党员的制度严格起来和健全起来，防止任何反革命分子混入；同时必须采取领导和群众相结合的办法，对那些来历不明或形迹可疑的人进行彻底的清理。要严格地把好人和坏人分别清楚。不能把好人的某些一般性质的可以改正的缺点和错误，同反革命分子的阴谋破坏混淆起来。但是对于暗藏的反革命分子，却不能丝毫放松，不能让他们用假检讨、假反省、避重就轻等两面派手段敷衍和蒙混过去。在厂矿企业中，必须加强保卫工作，对于各种事故必须下决心彻底地查清底细，使反革命分子不能在自然事故和责任事故的掩盖下进行破坏。在城市和农村中，对于纵火、暗杀、爆破以及各种破坏统购统销和互助合作的事件，必须大力组织侦察，同时发动广大群众协同破案。公安机关和群众性的治安委员会，都应该积极加强对敌斗争，有组织有计划地清查所辖区内各种暗藏的反革命分子。总之，全国人民必须团结一致，共同努力，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，不让一个漏网！
