Our reporter Li Gendi:

The correct implementation of ethnic policies is one of the keys to running agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by multiple ethnic groups. The smooth development of the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Unity Cooperative) in the Hui Autonomous Region of Minhe County, Qinghai Province, is an example.

The Hui Autonomous Region of Minhe County is inhabited by five ethnic groups: Hui, Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Tu. Historically, there were barriers between the various ethnic groups. In the early days of liberation, reactionary bandits even used ethnic divisions to provoke trouble, and ethnic disputes occurred. However, the Party insisted on implementing ethnic policies in Minhe County, gradually consolidated the democratic government, crushed the enemy's provocations, and led the mixed-living ethnic farmers to organize and develop production. The Unity Cooperative of the Hui Autonomous Region of Minhe County was voluntarily organized by the mixed-living Hui and Han farmers based on the correct implementation of ethnic policies and the strengthening of ethnic unity.

The Unity Cooperative has twenty-seven households, including fifteen Hui households and twelve Han households. Before the establishment of the cooperative, they participated in three mutual aid groups. At that time, they respected each other's ethnic customs. Collective labor further strengthened the friendship between the two ethnic groups, and crop yields also increased rapidly, which made them more confident that only by uniting with each other can they obtain a common happy life for all ethnic groups.

Unity Cooperative members fully deliberated on choosing an appropriate name for the cooperative. After joint discussions by farmers of both ethnic groups, they unanimously adopted the word "Unity," which symbolizes the relationship between the two ethnic groups. Electing cooperative staff was a matter of common concern for members of both ethnic groups. After repeated consultations among the members, eleven Hui members and seven Han members were elected to serve as the Unity Cooperative's director, deputy director, management committee members, and production team leaders. The members were very satisfied with the election results.

Under the education of the Party's ethnic policy, Hui and Han members of the Unity Cooperative try their best to be considerate and take care of each other in production labor and living habits.

During the Hui Muslims' Ramadan this year, Hui members needed money to buy kerosene. The Unity Cooperative immediately lent 60 yuan to help buy oil. When Hui people needed to buy Eid supplies at the end of Ramadan, the cooperative immediately lent them 150 yuan. Meetings within the cooperative also tried to take into account the difficulties faced by Hui members during Ramadan. During Ramadan, Hui members were generally assigned less farm work to facilitate their prayers and rest. During the Spring Festival this year, the cooperative wanted to mobilize people to carry goods to Xianmi (a Tibetan settlement area) eighty miles away. When assigning work, the members actively signed up, but the Han members remembered that this was the festival period for the Han and Tibetan people, and it would be very inconvenient for Hui members to eat along the way, so the Han people should go. During Ramadan, Hui people are very taboo about others offering food and smoking. Although some Hui and Han members have very good friendships, Han people quickly leave their Hui friends when they want to smoke. Sometimes, because Han members are close to Hui members, they can't help but offer food, but immediately realize their impoliteness and sincerely say "I'm sorry."

Like Han members, Hui members can also be very considerate of each other. When preparing for the Spring Festival, the cooperative needed to send a large cart to Babao Mountain to haul wood. Hui members Ma Yishan and Ma Ga'nu said: The Han people are about to celebrate the New Year, and some things are not yet ready. Hui members should be called to go. Other Hui members unanimously agreed. The Han members were very moved by Ma Ga'nu's and others' opinions. Sometimes, if Han people accidentally neglected to respect Hui people's habits in life, Hui people can understand.

The Unity Cooperative's management committee often repeatedly publicizes the importance of ethnic unity through various forms and continues to encourage farmers of both ethnic groups to further consolidate and strengthen ethnic unity. The friendship and unity between Hui and Han people in the Unity Cooperative has become a force. It is this unbreakable and solid force that has promoted the cooperative's work. Once, Han member Qi Shangren and Hui member Ma Yuan quarreled in the field over work. Qi Shangren angrily said:

"Our cooperative is called the Unity Cooperative, but what are we united about!" In the past, these words, which hurt ethnic feelings, could have caused ethnic disputes. However, the Unity Cooperative's cooperative leaders and members did not think this way at all. The director, Jin Wen (Hui), patiently criticized Qi Shangren, saying:

"Your quarrel over work cannot involve ethnic issues at all. You should deal with the matter on its merits. What you said is wrong." At the members' meeting, everyone criticized Qi Shangren again. Qi Shangren understood his mistake and made a review at the meeting.

The increasing unity of Hui and Han members in the Unity Cooperative has further inspired the members' enthusiasm for production. Last winter and this spring, when preparing for cultivation work, all sixty-seven male and female members of the cooperative (except those who were sick) participated in the activity of preparing fertilizer. They were divided into four contracting teams and expected to carry ash, burn ash, and beat ash for a total of 488 piles in 25 days, but they completed it two days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the work of accumulating household fertilizer also achieved great results.

At the beginning of spring plowing, the cooperative verified the members' land for the first time and sowed spring crops such as highland barley, barley, oats, potatoes, and rapeseed as scheduled. Currently, the crops they planted on the banks of the Haohe River are growing lush and green. The members are working hard to strive for a bumper harvest.

Correction: In the May 30th issue of this newspaper, on page 2, in the article "Use of Paint Additives," in the third line of the second paragraph, "five pounds of quicklime, half a pound of salt" should be "five kilograms of quicklime, half a kilogram of salt," and "fifty kilograms of water" should be "add fifty liters of water."

### 回汉两族农民组织的团结农业生产合作社

　　回汉两族农民组织的团结农业生产合作社
　　本报记者　李根蒂
    正确贯彻民族政策，是办好多民族共同组织的农业生产合作社的关键之一。青海省亹源县回族自治区团结农业生产合作社（以下简称团结社）的顺利发展，就是一个例证。
    亹源县回族自治区境内居住了回、汉、蒙、藏、土五个民族。各民族之间在历史上有隔阂。解放初期反动派匪徒还曾利用民族隔阂进行挑拨，发生过民族纠纷。但是党在亹源县坚持贯彻民族政策，逐步巩固了民主政权，粉碎了敌人的挑拨，并领导杂居的各族农民组织起来，发展生产。亹源县回族自治区团结社就是在正确贯彻民族政策、加强民族团结的基础上，由杂居的回、汉两族农民自愿组织的。
    团结社有社员二十七户，其中回民十五户，汉民十二户。成立社前，他们分别参加在三个互助组里，那时彼此就十分尊重民族的风俗习惯；集体劳动更加强了两个民族的友谊，农作物产量也迅速地提高了，这使他们更增加了只有互相团结才能得到各民族共同幸福生活的信心。
    团结社社员为选择适当的社名，曾进行了充分的酝酿，经过两族农民共同讨论，一致通过采用象征两个民族关系的“团结”二字。选举社工作人员是两族社员共同关心的问题。经过社员之间的反复协商，结果选出十一个回民和七个汉民社员分别担任团结社社长、副社长、管理委员、生产组长等职务。选举的结果，社员十分满意。
    在党的民族政策教育下，团结社回、汉族社员在生产劳动和生活习惯上都尽量互相体贴、互相照顾。
    今年回民封斋期间，回民社员缺钱购买灯油，团结社马上把社款借出六十元帮助买油。开斋时回民需要购买开斋用品，社里又立即借给了一百五十元。社内开会也尽量照顾回民在封斋期的困难。封斋期间给回民社员一般分配农活较少，以便利他们作礼拜和休息。今年春节期间，社内要动员人到八十里外的仙米（藏族聚居地区）去驮东西，派工时社员们都积极报名，但汉民社员想起这正是汉、藏人民过节期，回民社员一路吃饭很不方便，应该让汉民去。回民封斋期非常忌讳别人让饭和吸烟，有的回、汉社员间虽然有很好的交情，汉民要吸烟也很快就离开自己的回民朋友。有时汉民社员因为同回民社员亲密，偶然禁不住也就让饭吃，但马上发现自己失礼，就诚恳地表示“对不起”。
      像汉民社员一样，回民社员也能十分体贴对方。在准备过春节时，社内要出动大车到八宝山拉木料，回民社员马乙山和马尕奴说：汉民快过年了，有些东西还没有准备好，应该叫回民社员去。其他回民社员一致同意。汉民社员听了马尕奴他们的意见，都十分感动。有时，汉民在生活上偶然疏忽没有尊重到回民的习惯，回民也都能谅解。
    团结社的管理委员会经常通过各种形式反复宣传民族团结的重要，继续鼓励两族农民进一步巩固和加强民族团结。团结社回、汉民之间的友谊和团结成为一种力量，正是这种击不破的牢固力量，才推动了社务工作。有一次，汉民社员祁尚仁同回民社员马元在田间为做活吵了架。祁尚仁生气地说：
  “我们社叫团结社，到底团结个什哩！”在过去，这一句有伤民族感情的话很可能引起民族纠纷的。但是，团结社的社务领导人员和社员却全不这样认识。社长金文（回族）很耐心地批评祁尚仁说：
  “你们俩为做活吵架，根本不能牵扯到民族问题，应该就事论事。你这话是不对的。”在社员会上，大家又对祁尚仁进行了批评；祁尚仁明白了自己的错误，在会场进行了检讨。
    团结社回、汉族社员的日益团结，越发鼓舞了社员们的生产热情。去冬、今春准备耕种工作，全社六十七个男、女社员（除去害病的），都参加了准备肥料的活动。他们分为四个包工小组、预计在二十五天中抬灰、烧灰、打灰共四百八十八堆，结果提前两天完成了。同时开展的积家肥工作也收到了很大成绩。
    春耕开始，社内第一次查实了社员土地，如期播种下青稞、大麦、燕麦、马铃薯、菜籽等春季作物。目前，他们播种在浩亹河畔的田禾，已经绿油油地长起来了。社员们为争取丰收，正在紧张地劳动。更正：五月三十日本报第二版“使用油漆掺合剂”一文第二段第三行“生石灰五斤，食盐半斤”应为“生石灰五公斤，食盐半公斤”，“水五十公斤”应为“加水五十公升。”
