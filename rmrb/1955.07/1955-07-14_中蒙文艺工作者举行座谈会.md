Xinhua News Agency, July 12th. On the afternoon of the 12th, some members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble held a symposium with Chinese literary and art workers to exchange experiences in the arts of the two countries.

    At the symposium, Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, extended a warm welcome to the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble on behalf of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He said that the ensemble's visit and performances in China will surely make valuable contributions to the development of friendly relations between China and Mongolia.

    In the music group, chaired by Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, the singer Tsed of the Song and Dance Ensemble performed the whistle from the a cappella "Ode to the Altai Mountains." The beautiful whistle sounded like a melodious shepherd's flute, and this whistle, achieved through diligent practice, can perform all kinds of songs. Then, Dambijantsan played the Mongolian folk instrument, the horse-head fiddle. Chinese musicians warmly welcomed the speech of Tserendorj, the art director of the Song and Dance Ensemble, in which he introduced the ensemble's successful experiences on how to inherit national traditions in creation, the national characteristics of music, and how to combine national and foreign instruments in the orchestra. The female singer Purbusuren sang "Xinjiang Hao" in Chinese, and the lyrical soloist Haidob sang "In That Faraway Place," which won warm applause. At the meeting, Chinese instrumentalists Li Tingsong and Guan Pinghu played a piece of music for the guests with the Chinese ancient instruments pipa and guqin respectively, and the male soloist Fang Yingxuan sang the Chinese folk song "In That Faraway Place."

    The dance group was chaired by Wu Xiaobang, Chairman of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association. Gombosuren, the performer of the dance "Aksala," introduced how he created the heroic deeds and moving image of an ancient hero resisting invaders in this dance, and performed the movements of the dance. Robsandaa, the choreographer of "Friendship Dance," introduced the process of creating this dance. Hu Guogang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association, and Gao Dian'an of the Central Experimental Opera House, both spoke about their impressions after watching the Mongolian dance. They highly appreciated the performing arts of the dancers and expressed that Chinese literary and art workers should learn from Mongolian artists.

    At the symposium, the Chinese Musicians Association and the Chinese Dance Art Research Association presented gifts to the Song and Dance Ensemble.
