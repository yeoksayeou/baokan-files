Xinhua News Agency, July 25th - The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussions today.

The deputies and heads of various state organs who spoke at the meeting today were: Dao Jingban, Hu Ziang, Chen Jiageng, Wang Heshou, Zhang Bojun, Ma Xulun, Jiang Xueshan, Bao Erhan, Lin Qiaozhi, Lin Wenbiao, Zhang Naiqi, Liao Luyan, Xu Deheng, Zhang Guohua, Wang Wenshan, Xie Juezai, Zhang Youyu, Huang Huoqing, Yang Si, and others, totaling nineteen people.

Deputy Dao Jingban pointed out in his speech: Since the establishment of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan, remarkable achievements have been made in various construction works. However, the unreasonable feudal land system that still exists in the autonomous region is restricting the development of the productive forces of the vast laboring peasants. This is the main factor hindering the development and progress of the various ethnic groups in the autonomous region and the root cause of the long-term poverty of the people. He said that only by reforming the old social system can production be developed and can the various ethnic groups in the autonomous region be freed from poverty and backwardness and gradually transition to a socialist society together with all fraternal ethnic groups. Therefore, the People's Government Committee of the Autonomous Region convened a meeting in April this year and, based on the specific conditions of the Dehong area, formulated the "Draft Regulations on Land Adjustment in the Dai Area" and, in accordance with these draft regulations, adopted the method of peaceful consultation to carry out pilot work on land adjustment. He said that the current central task of the autonomous region is to reform the land system. At the same time, they are actively striving to realize the various autonomous rights stipulated in the Constitution. He said that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and higher-level state organs, with the support of all ethnic groups, especially the Han people, and with the help of Han cadres, we are confidently doing this work to catch up with advanced fraternal ethnic groups as soon as possible and gradually enter a socialist society!

Deputy Hu Ziang said in his speech that he had discovered in his inspection work that many counter-revolutionaries colluded with unscrupulous merchants to undermine the grain policy, and these bad elements must be resolutely and mercilessly attacked. The implementation of the first Five-Year Plan by the state is a severe test for every enterprise and every individual in capitalist industry and commerce. He hoped that private industrialists and businessmen would, together with the people of the whole country, always be vigilant, distinguish between enemies and friends, be determined, and, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, loyally accept socialist transformation and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to implement the state's first Five-Year Plan.

Deputy Chen Jiageng's speech expressed the joy of overseas Chinese at the motherland's beginning to implement the great Five-Year Plan and to control the Yellow River's water damage and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy. He believes that this is an unprecedented grand event in China's thousands of years, and it will encourage overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and strive to realize this great plan.

Minister of Heavy Industry Wang Heshou pointed out in his speech that due to imperialist aggression and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, China's steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries had very weak foundations; after liberation, although these industries have developed, they are still very backward. To overcome this backwardness, on the one hand, it is necessary to improve enterprise management and improve technical level in the existing factories and mines, in order to increase output and increase new product varieties. The more important aspect is to correctly implement the basic construction plan stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, ensure the completion of the construction of several steel bases and new non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials production bases stipulated in the Five-Year Plan on schedule, and greatly improve the capacity of these industries. Wang Heshou said that in order to ensure the completion of the basic construction tasks assigned to the Ministry of Heavy Industry by the Five-Year Plan, in addition to practicing strict economy and overcoming waste, the problems that need to be solved now are: actively exploring resources and preparing raw material bases; strengthening overall planning and mutual cooperation in basic construction; improving design standards and learning complete sets of design; and organizing construction enterprises to shift from civil construction to industrial construction. Wang Heshou then explained some understandings and measures being taken on these issues. Wang Heshou also pointed out that it is necessary to correct the erroneous tendency of burying oneself in business and not asking about politics, raise vigilance, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and protect basic construction.

Wang Heshou said that in construction, there is also a factor that plays a huge role, which is the selfless help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts. With the help of Soviet experts, technical personnel in all aspects of basic construction have made great progress. We have completed some arduous projects, and we will learn from Soviet experts how to build more arduous projects.

Minister of Communications Zhang Bojun said in his speech that the transportation department has been performing well in implementing the national plan for the past two years. However, to ensure the completion and strive for early completion of the transportation tasks in the first Five-Year Plan, the transportation department must make more efforts and earnestly overcome many shortcomings and difficulties in its current work. In the future, the following five tasks must be done well: implement the policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement for various means of transportation; strengthen local transportation work and give full play to the role of various local means of transportation in short-distance transportation; improve and improve the management level of existing enterprises, and gradually implement comprehensive planned management and economic accounting system on the basis of strengthening economic and technical quota work; effectively use state investment and use state funds to ensure the continuous growth of transportation capacity in accordance with the spirit of the central government's campaign to increase production and practice economy; and train various specialized technical cadres and management cadres accordingly according to the development plan of the transportation industry.

Deputy Ma Xulun emphasized in his speech that the realization of the Five-Year Plan is an arduous task. This is a special form of class struggle in the current domestic and international environment. He believes that when the people of the whole country are working hard to realize the Five-Year Plan, they must fully raise their revolutionary vigilance, identify and expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely suppress them. He said: Raising revolutionary vigilance obviously contains two meanings. On the one hand, we must learn to be politically sensitive and be good at identifying any hidden counter-revolutionaries; on the other hand, we must be vigilant ourselves, examine our words and deeds, and every move to see if there is any opportunity for counter-revolutionaries to take advantage of. He expressed that he must work hard to study, raise vigilance, and strengthen unity under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and dedicate all his strength to consolidating the people's democratic united front and to the great socialist cause of the motherland.

Army representative Jiang Xueshan said: The motherland's large-scale economic construction is carried out under the conditions of imperialist encirclement, and the enemy is very hostile to our socialist construction cause. As a soldier, I deeply feel that the obligation we bear to defend the peaceful labor of the people of the motherland is supremely glorious and extremely important. He said: Soldiers like to compare the motherland to a beautiful garden and themselves to gatekeepers. Everyone feels that it is supremely glorious to be a gatekeeper of the motherland's garden. He said: We love peace. We have never had and will never have any intention of invading other countries, but we will never allow any invaders to break into our motherland's garden and destroy our peaceful labor.

Deputy Bao Erhan said: Before liberation, the thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang suffered long-term exploitation and oppression under the bloody rule of the reactionary government, and their economy and culture were severely damaged, resulting in a long-term state of backwardness. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups have obtained equal rights in politics, ethnic relations have fundamentally changed, and the people of all ethnic groups have been closely united. On the basis of national unity, work such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries and reforming the land system has been carried out, which has improved the political awareness and enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups and developed various production and cultural and educational undertakings. This has created favorable conditions for promoting ethnic regional autonomy in the Xinjiang region. He said that in areas where ethnic autonomous organs have been established, the rights of the minority ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs have been realized, further showing a thriving new atmosphere. Bao Erhan finally expressed his firm belief that under the wise leadership of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will work with full confidence together with the people of the whole country to liberate our territory of Taiwan, to successfully complete the first Five-Year Plan and socialist construction, and to defend Asian and world peace.

Deputy Lin Qiaozhi said in her speech that in the process of gradually realizing the Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to overcome the situation where medical and health work is not commensurate with the speed of economic development and the needs that are growing as a result. First, we must conscientiously implement the policy of serving workers in factories and mines and strengthen health care work in factories and mines. Second, we must attach importance to and actively strengthen health propaganda work in factories and mines. Third, in terms of training cadres, we should implement the principle of focusing on improving quality while taking quantity into account. Fourth, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine should unite to vigorously carry out medical scientific research work under leadership.

Deputy Lin Wenbiao, based on his research in science and technology, responded to the call to increase production and practice economy, oppose waste, and accumulate funds in his speech, and suggested that industrial departments should rationally use national resources, improve production technology, and improve the quality and quantity of products. He cited several examples, such as using the sulfur dioxide gas released from the recovery smelter to produce sulfuric acid, using methane from coal mines to manufacture carbon black needed by the rubber industry, improving the technology of refining and manufacturing citronella oil for spices, and improving rubber processing technology and the production technology of automobile tires, illustrating that the improvement of science and technology can save a lot of funds for the country. Lin Wenbiao also suggested that various industrial production departments should pay attention to mutual connection and exchange of experience, and workers, technicians, and engineers should strive to study science and technology.

Minister of Food Zhang Naiqi gave a detailed explanation of the business work of the grain system in his speech. He said that the government still has to pay a considerable amount of money every year in terms of grain work, but the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in grain work is very large. In the future, as long as we do a good job and combine it with the gradual rational adjustment of prices, it is possible to achieve a state of little or no losses within two or three years. The serious problem at present is that the cost level in 1954 was higher than that in 1953, and the cost level in the first quarter of this year was even higher than in the same period in 1954. The reasons for the increase in costs are mainly the major floods last year, the tense grain supply between March and April this year, and the poor quality of grain stored in warehouses in many places the year before last and last year, but the insufficient subjective efforts of the grain department are also a very important reason.

Zhang Naiqi made a specific analysis of saving funds, saving expenses, improving supply, rationally adjusting prices, strengthening planning, and overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of organizational settings and staffing in grain work, and pointed out specific ways to improve these tasks.

Zhang Naiqi emphasized that grain work is related to the production and life of all the people. Even a few percent of errors and shortcomings can cause losses to millions or even tens of millions of people. At the same time, the characteristics of grain work are that there are many points and a wide area. Only by relying on the supervision of the broad masses of the people can we correct errors and shortcomings in our work.

Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan made a speech at the meeting on agricultural production, the cooperative movement, and the rural situation. He said that the increased production targets for grain, cotton, and oil crops, as well as livestock and aquatic products, stipulated in the draft first Five-Year Plan should be guaranteed to be completed, and efforts should be made to exceed them. Because the first two years of the Five-Year Plan encountered natural disasters, the agricultural production increase plan was not completed, which aggravated the tasks for the last three years. The tasks of agricultural workers and farmers across the country are: to comprehensively and overfulfill the agricultural increase plans for the last three years and strive to realize the first Five-Year Plan.

Liao Luyan said that the proportion of industrial and agricultural investment stipulated in the draft first Five-Year Plan is appropriate. It is based on the overall tasks of the country during the transition period and is also in line with the specific conditions of our country's current agricultural production. Under the conditions that our country's industry is still backward, the main way to develop agricultural production is to rely on mutual assistance and cooperation, rationally use labor, make full use of land, improve farming technology, strengthen disaster resistance capabilities, and give play to the superiority of collective production. The agricultural investment stipulated in the Five-Year Plan is not a small amount and is in line with the current needs of developing agricultural production. The argument that industrial investment should be reduced and agricultural investment increased is wrong. Only on the basis of industrialization can agricultural productivity be improved. If we reduce industrial investment and increase agricultural investment, the result will be to postpone socialist industrialization. And postponing socialist industrialization is against the greatest interests of the peasants, against the greatest interests of all the people, and against the overall task.

Liao Luyan said in his speech that the agricultural cooperative movement has been successful in recent years. The results of the recent rectification of cooperatives in various places show that the number of cooperatives reduced is less than 5 percent, and the remaining cooperatives are about 650,000, with more than 15 million farmers joining the cooperatives, accounting for about 14 percent of the total number of farmers in the country. This fully proves that the large development of cooperatives last winter and this spring was generally healthy and normal.

Liao Luyan finally used many concrete materials to illustrate that the lives of farmers have been generally improved in recent years. However, for a better and happier future, farmers must work hard together with the people of the whole country to build socialism.

Deputy Xu Deheng emphasized in his speech that in order to successfully realize the Five-Year Plan, a large number of specialized talents in all aspects who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to socialist construction are needed. In order to shoulder the glorious tasks assigned to them by the state in the Five-Year Plan, cultural, educational, and scientific workers across the country must further carry out ideological transformation work and improve their political and ideological level. He said that there is still a certain degree of individualism, liberalism, subjectivism, and other bourgeois ideas and work styles among intellectuals. We must learn serious lessons from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, master the ideological weapon of dialectical materialism, and continue to wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois idealism. Any idea that Marxism-Leninism has nothing to do with one's own academic work, or that only cares about business and ignores politics, is wrong, harmful, and should be corrected.

Deputy Zhang Guohua spoke about the remarkable achievements made in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Tibet region in the past two years. He said that the first Five-Year Plan fully took into account the promotion of the development of economic and cultural undertakings in the Tibet region. The State Council's two decisions on transportation issues in Tibet and on assisting the local government of Tibet in construction, as well as the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, are all part of the first Five-Year Plan. The completion of the Five-Year Plan will create better conditions for the economic and cultural development of Tibet and will strongly strengthen the unity between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. Therefore, the realization of the first Five-Year Plan is a cause that concerns the vital interests of the people of the Tibet region. We are willing to work in the Tibet region to realize the tasks and requirements stipulated in this great plan. Zhang Guohua said: The first Five-Year Plan put forward to all ethnic groups in the country the requirements of consolidating unity, strengthening cooperation, and actively participating in the political and economic construction of the entire country. In this spirit, in the Tibet region, we should strive to strengthen the unity between the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the motherland and fully realize regional autonomy in Tibet.

Wang Wenshan, a delegate from Liaoning Province and a model worker in industry, said that their factory has launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, which is expected to increase production and save more than 4.1 million yuan of wealth for the country this year. He stated that in order to ensure the completion of the national plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy, he is determined to work together with all the workers in the factory to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, strive to improve technical level, and at the same time, improve enterprise management in accordance with the principles of socialist enterprise management, strive to improve management level, widely launch labor competitions, and raise vigilance to strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from sabotage.

Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai gave a brief speech on relief work in state organs. Xie Juezai said that the floods in the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in 1954 were rare in the past hundred years, and these areas also suffered rare cold waves and heavy snow last winter, which aggravated the spring and summer famines this year. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the efforts of the vast number of cadres and the masses, the famine, although extremely serious, was finally overcome through the unified struggle under the unified leadership of the people's government, regardless of region, thereby protecting the lives of the people in the disaster areas and restoring the production of the people in the disaster areas. The reasons for achieving such an effect are, first of all, the correct implementation of the Party and the government's disaster relief policies and the consistent support of the people of the whole country. The second is the joint efforts of Party and government personnel at all levels, especially grassroots cadres, activists, and the people. The third is the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. From July last year to June this year, this grain year, 10.6 billion jin of grain and more than 140 million jin of seeds were supplied to the disaster areas, so no matter how tense the disaster situation was, grain prices remained stable.

Deputy Zhang Youyu talked about the issues of grain planned supply, streamlining and economy, primary and secondary school education, and the handling of urban vagrants in Beijing. He said that Beijing's population is increasing rapidly, and the growth of grain sales has exceeded the growth of the population, which shows that there is a lot of waste of grain, and the speculation and resale of unscrupulous merchants is also quite serious. In order to eliminate waste and leakage and save grain, it is necessary to strengthen the management of planned grain supply. This is not only good for the country, but also for every citizen who lives thriftily, but it is unfavorable to unscrupulous merchants. There are also serious phenomena of waste in basic construction, factory and mine production, urban construction, and institutional staffing in Beijing, and a series of measures are now being taken to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Beijing also has a group of parasitic people left over from the old society, and they must be resolutely organized to engage in agricultural production in conjunction with the national plan for immigrants to reclaim wasteland.

Deputy Huang Huoqing spoke about the specific situation and current tasks of Tianjin. He said: As an original industrial base, Tianjin has the conditions and responsibilities to support the country's great socialist construction. It shoulders important tasks in accumulating funds, training technical forces, supplying equipment, and producing more, better, and cheaper goods to meet the needs of people's production and life. Huang Huoqing then raised two prominent problems in Tianjin at present. One is the problem of opposing waste and practicing strict economy. He expressed his firm support for and implementation of the central government's policy of practicing strict economy and specific measures, and put forward several methods for striving for greater savings. He expects that as a result of implementing economy this year, Tianjin will save 70 million yuan for the country in all aspects. The other is the problem of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and safeguarding socialist construction. He described the rampant activities of hidden counter-revolutionary elements in Tianjin and criticized the peaceful complacency that is growing in some cadres. He said that the main thing at present is to correct right-leaning thoughts and implement resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary elements.

Deputy Yang Si said in his speech: Zhejiang has very good natural conditions and great production potential in all aspects. In the future, according to the direction pointed out by the Five-Year Plan and combined with the specific conditions of the province, we will continue to implement the agricultural production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. We must not only do a good job in grain production, but also combine the development of other crops and by-products; we must not only continue to strengthen the work and production in the plains, but also actively develop mountain economy and marine fishery production. He expressed confidence in completing the various indicators stipulated by the state, and if the work is done better, it is possible to overfulfill the tasks.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Saifuddin, Zhang Wentian, Ma Xulun, Cai Tingkai, Luo Longji, and Rong Yiren.

Today's meeting started at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 7:15 PM. The plenary discussion will continue tomorrow.

    全国人民代表大会代表继续发言
    新华社二十五日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天继续举行大会讨论。
    今天在会上发言的代表和国家机关各部门负责人有：刀京版、胡子昂、陈嘉庚、王鹤寿、章伯钧、马叙伦、江雪山、鲍尔汉、林巧稚、林文彪、章乃器、廖鲁言、许德珩、张国华、王文山、谢觉哉、张友渔、黄火青、杨思一等十九人。
    刀京版代表在发言中指出：云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区成立以来在各项建设工作方面取得了显著的成就。但是，自治区目前还存在着的不合理的封建的土地制度，束缚着广大劳动农民生产力的发展。这是阻碍自治区各民族发展进步的主要因素，是人民长期贫困的根源。他说，只有改革了旧的社会制度，才能发展生产，才能使自治区各民族摆脱贫困和落后，并同各兄弟民族一道，逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。所以自治区人民政府委员会在今年四月间召开了会议，根据德宏地区的具体情况，制定了傣族地区“调整土地条例草案”，并依照这个条例草案，采取和平协商的方法，进行了土地调整的试点工作。他说，自治区的当前中心工作就是改革土地制度，同时，正积极努力地在实现宪法所规定的各项自治权利。他说，在中国共产党和上级国家机关的正确领导下，在各民族尤其是汉族人民的支持和汉族干部的帮助下，我们正满怀信心地做好这些工作，争取早日赶上先进的兄弟民族，逐步地进入社会主义社会！
    胡子昂代表在发言中说，他在视察工作中曾发现许多反革命分子勾结奸商破坏粮食政策的罪恶活动，对于这些坏分子，一定要坚决给以无情的打击。国家在实施第一个五年计划中，对资本主义工商业每一个企业、每一个人都是一个严重的考验，希望私营工商界同全国人民一道，随时提高警惕，分清敌我，下定决心，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，忠诚地接受社会主义改造，展开增产节约运动，为贯彻实现国家第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    陈嘉庚代表的发言表达了国外华侨对祖国开始实行伟大的五年计划和根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的欢欣情绪。他认为这是我国几千年来没有过的盛举，将鼓舞国外华侨和全国人民一道，更加团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为实现这个伟大计划而努力。
    重工业部部长王鹤寿在发言中指出：过去由于帝国主义的侵略和国民党反动派的统治，我国钢铁、有色金属、化学、建筑材料等工业，基础都十分薄弱；解放以后，这些工业虽然有了发展，但仍然很落后。要克服这种落后状态，一方面需要在现有的工厂矿山中改进企业管理，提高技术水平，以提高产量增加新的产品品种。更主要的一方面，是正确地执行第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设计划，保证按期完成五年计划中几个钢铁基地和新的有色金属、化学、建筑材料生产基地的建设，大大提高这几类工业的能力。王鹤寿说，为了保证完成五年计划规定给重工业部的基本建设任务，除了厉行节约、克服浪费现象外，现在要求解决的问题是：积极勘探资源，准备原料基地；加强基本建设的通盘筹划与相互协作；提高设计水平，学会成套设计；组织建筑企业由民用建筑向工业建筑转变。王鹤寿接着就这几个问题说明一些认识和正在采取的措施。王鹤寿还指出：必须纠正埋头业务不问政治的错误倾向，提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫基本建设。
    王鹤寿说，在建设中还有一个起着巨大作用的因素，就是苏联政府与苏联专家的无私帮助。在苏联专家帮助之下，基本建设中各方面的技术人员都有了极大的进步。我们已经完成了一些艰巨的工程，我们将向苏联专家学会建设更多艰巨的工程。
    交通部部长章伯钧在发言中说，两年来交通部门执行国家计划的情况是良好的。但交通部门要保证完成和争取提前完成第一个五年计划运输方面的任务，还必须做更多的努力，认真地克服目前工作中的许多缺点和困难。今后，要做好以下五项工作：对各种运输工具贯彻统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针；加强地方交通工作，充分发挥地方上各种运输工具在短程运输中的作用；改进与提高现有企业的经营管理水平，在加强经济技术定额工作的基础上，逐步实行全面的计划管理和实施经济核算制；有效地运用国家投资，根据中央增产节约的精神，把国家资金使用在保证运输力的不断增长上面；根据交通事业的发展计划，相应地培养各种专门的技术干部和管理干部。
      马叙伦代表在发言中强调指出，实现五年计划是一桩艰巨的工作。这在目前国内外环境中是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。他认为当全国人民为实现五年计划而努力的时候，必须充分提高革命警惕性，辨别和揭发一切暗藏的反革命分子，予以坚决的镇压。他说：提高革命警惕性显然包含着两重意义，一方面要学会政治嗅觉灵敏，善于辨别任何暗藏的反革命分子；一方面要自己警惕自己，检点自己的一言一行，一举一动，有没有给反革命分子以可乘的机会。他表示一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，和所联系的群众一道努力学习，提高警惕，加强团结，为巩固人民民主统一战线，为祖国伟大的社会主义事业献出一切力量。
    军队代表江雪山说：祖国巨大规模的经济建设，是在帝国主义包围的条件下进行的，敌人非常仇视我们的社会主义建设事业。我是军人，我深深感觉到我们对于保卫祖国人民的和平劳动所担负的义务是无尚光荣和十分重大的。他说：战士们喜欢把祖国比喻为一座美丽的大花园，把自己比喻为看门人。大家感到做祖国大花园的看门人，是无尚光荣的。他说：我们喜爱和平，我们从来就没有而且永远也不会有侵略别国的打算，但是我们也决不允许任何侵略者来闯进我们祖国的大花园，破坏我们的和平劳动。
    鲍尔汉代表说：新疆的十三个民族，解放前在反动统治的血腥统治下，长期遭受着剥削和压迫，经济和文化遭受到严重的破坏，以致长期处于落后的状态。解放后，各族人民得到了在政治上平等的权利，民族关系已根本改变，各民族人民已经亲密地团结起来。在民族团结的基础上，进行了镇压反革命、改革土地制度等工作，提高了各族人民的政治觉悟和积极性，发展了各项生产事业和文化教育事业。这就给新疆地区推行民族区域自治创造了有利条件。他说：在已建立起民族自治机关的地区，实现了各少数民族当家作主的权利，进一步表现出欣欣向荣的新气象。鲍尔汉最后表示坚决相信，新疆各族人民在中共中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，将信心百倍地同全国人民一道，为解放我国领土台湾、为胜利完成第一个五年计划和社会主义建设、为保卫亚洲和世界和平而努力奋斗。
    林巧稚代表在发言中说，在五年计划的逐步实现的进程中，必须克服医药卫生工作和经济发展速度以及由此而日益增长的需要不相称的情况。第一、必须认真贯彻面向厂矿为工人服务的方针，加强工矿保健工作。第二、必须重视并积极加强厂矿单位的卫生宣传工作。第三、在培养干部方面应该贯彻着重提高质量、同时兼顾数量的原则。第四、中西医团结起来，有领导地大力开展医学科学研究工作。
    林文彪代表根据他在科学技术工作方面的研究，在发言中响应增产节约、反对浪费、积累资金的号召，建议工业部门应当合理地使用国家资源，改进生产技术、提高产品的质量与数量。他列举了几个事例，如利用回收冶炼厂放出的二氧化硫气体生产硫酸，利用煤矿瓦斯制造橡胶工业需要的炭黑，改进提炼制造香料用的香茅油的技术，改进橡胶加工技术和汽车轮胎的生产技术，说明科学技术的改进，可以为国家节省大量资金。林文彪还建议各个工业生产部门注意互相联系、交换经验，工人、技术员、工程师要努力钻研科学技术。
    粮食部部长章乃器在发言中对粮食系统的业务工作作了详细的说明。他说，政府在粮食工作方面每年仍要赔相当多的钱，但是粮食工作中增产节约的潜在力是很大的。今后只要做好工作，结合价格的逐步合理调整，是可以在二、三年之内做到由少赔而不赔的。目前严重的问题在于一九五四年的费用水平比一九五三年高，今年第一季度的费用水平比一九五四年同期还高。费用增加的原因主要是去年的大水灾，今年三、四月间粮食供应的紧张和许多地方前年、去年入库粮食质量差等，但是粮食部门主观努力不够也是很重要的原因。
    章乃器对粮食工作的节约资金、节约费用，改善供应，合理调整价格，加强计划性，克服机构设置和人员编制的混乱现象等方面作了具体分析，并指出了改进这些工作的具体办法。
    章乃器着重指出：粮食工作关系着全体人民的生产和生活，只要有百分之几的错误和缺点就可以使几百万以至几千万人遭受到损失，同时粮食工作的特点是点多面广，只有依靠广大人民群众的监督，才能纠正工作中的错误和缺点。
    农业部部长廖鲁言就农业生产、合作化运动和农村情况在会上作了发言。他说，第一个五年计划草案所规定的粮食、棉花和油料作物以及牲畜、水产等增产指标，应该保证完成，力争超过。由于五年计划的头两年都遇到自然灾害，没有完成农业增产计划，加重了后三年的任务。全国农业工作者和农民的任务是：全面地超额地完成后三年的农业增产计划，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    廖鲁言说，第一个五年计划草案所规定的工业、农业投资比例是适当的，是根据国家在过渡时期总任务规定的，也是符合于我国当前农业生产的具体条件的。在我国工业还落后的条件下，发展农业生产的主要途径，是依靠互助合作，合理使用劳力，充分利用土地，改进耕作技术，加强抗灾能力，发挥集体生产的优越性。五年计划规定的农业投资，数目不算小，并且同目前发展农业生产的需要是相适应的。那种认为应当削减工业投资增加农业投资的论调是错误的。只有在工业化的基础上，才能提高农业生产力。如果我们削减工业投资，增加农业投资，其结果就是推迟社会主义工业化。而推迟社会主义工业化，是违反农民的最大利益的，是违反全体人民的最大利益的，是违反总任务的。
    廖鲁言在发言中说，几年来农业合作化运动是有成绩的。最近各地整顿合作社的结果，减少的社数不到百分之五，保持下来的合作社约有六十五万个，入社的农户有一千五百多万户，约占全国农户总数的百分之十四，这就充分证明在去冬今春合作社的大发展中，一般是健康正常的。
    廖鲁言最后用许多具体材料，说明几年来农民的生活已经有了普遍的改善。但是，为了更美好的幸福的未来，农民必须和全国人民一起艰苦奋斗，建设社会主义。
    许德珩代表在发言中着重指出：要胜利地实现五年计划，就需要大批的忠于祖国、忠于社会主义建设的各方面的专门人才。全国文教科学工作者，为了担负起五年计划中国家所赋予的光荣任务，就必须进一步进行思想改造工作，提高政治思想水平。他说，目前知识分子中还存在着某种程度的个人主义、自由主义、主观主义等资产阶级思想和作风，我们必须通过胡风反革命集团事件吸取严重的教训，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，掌握辩证唯物主义这一思想武器，继续向资产阶级唯心主义进行坚决的斗争。任何认为马克思列宁主义与自己的学术无关，或只顾业务，忽视政治的思想，都是错误的、有害的，应当改正的。
    张国华代表在发言中谈到西藏地区过去两年来在政治、经济、文化各方面工作中所获得的显著成就，他说，第一个五年计划中充分注意了促进西藏地区的经济事业和文化事业的发展。国务院关于西藏交通运输问题和关于帮助西藏地方进行建设的两项决定，以及修筑康藏、青藏公路等，都是第一个五年计划的组成部分。五年计划的完成将给西藏经济文化的发展创造更好的条件，将有力地加强民族间与民族内部的团结。因此，第一个五年计划的实现是攸关西藏地区人民切身利益的事业，我们愿在西藏地区，为实现这个伟大的计划所规定的任务和要求而努力。张国华说：第一个五年计划向国内各民族提出了巩固团结、加强合作，积极地参与整个国家的政治生活和经济建设的要求。本此精神，在西藏地区，我们应该为加强藏族和祖国其他民族的团结，完满实现西藏区域自治而努力奋斗。
    辽宁省代表、工业劳动模范王文山说，他们的工厂已经开展起增产节约运动，总计今年全年可为国家增产节约四百一十多万元的财富。他表示：为了保证完成国家计划和增产节约计划，他决心和全厂职工共同努力，切实学习苏联先进经验，认真贯彻苏联专家建议，努力提高技术水平，同时按照社会主义企业管理原则，改进企业管理，努力提高管理水平，广泛开展劳动竞赛，并提高警惕，严防反革命分子破坏。
    内务部部长谢觉哉就国家机关中的救济工作作了简要的发言。谢觉哉说，一九五四年长江、淮河的洪水是近百年来少有的，这些地区在去年冬季又遭受了近百年来少有的寒潮大雪，因而加重了今年的春荒和夏荒。但由于党和政府的正确领导，广大干部和群众的努力，在人民政府统一领导下不分地域地协同斗争，灾荒虽然异常严重，终于被战胜了，因而保护了灾区人民的生命，恢复了灾区人民的生产。取得这样效果的原因，首先是党和人民政府救灾政策的正确贯彻和全国人民的一致支援。其次是各级党政人员特别是基层干部、积极分子和人民群众的共同努力。第三是粮食统购统销政策的实施。从去年七月到今年六月这个粮食年度，供应灾区粮食一百零六亿斤，种子一亿四千余万斤，因而灾情不论怎样紧张，粮价始终平稳。
    张友渔代表在发言中谈到北京市的粮食计划供应、精简节约、中小学教育，和城市游民的处理等问题。他说，北京市人口增加很快，粮食销售的增长又超过了人口的增长，这说明粮食的浪费很大，奸商的投机倒运也相当严重。为了杜绝浪费、走漏，以节约粮食，必须加强对粮食计划供应的管理。这不仅对国家，而且对每一个克勤克俭过日子的市民都有好处，只是对奸商不利。北京市在基本建设、厂矿生产、城市建设、机关编制上也存在着严重的浪费现象，现正采取一系列厉行节约、反对浪费的措施。北京市还有一批旧社会遗留下来的寄生人口，必须结合国家移民垦荒的计划，坚决地组织他们从事农业生产。
    黄火青代表在发言中谈到天津市的具体情况和当前任务。他说：天津作为一个原有工业基地，它有条件有责任支援国家社会主义大建设。它在积累资金，培养技术力量，供应设备以及生产更多、更好、更廉价的商品以满足人民生产和生活的需要方面，担负着重大的任务。黄火青接着提出天津市目前比较突出的两个问题。一个是反对浪费、厉行节约的问题。他表示坚决拥护和贯彻中央厉行节约的方针和具体措施，并且提出了为争取更大的节约的几项办法。他预计天津市今年实行节约的结果，全市各方面可为国家节约七千万元。另一个是坚决镇压反革命、保卫社会主义建设问题。他叙述了天津暗藏的反革命分子的猖狂活动的情况，并批判了在部分干部中滋长着的太平麻痹思想。他说：当前主要的是纠正右倾思想，对反革命分子实行坚决的镇压。
    杨思一代表在发言中说：浙江自然条件很好，各方面的生产潜力很大。今后将根据五年计划所指出的方向结合本省的具体情况，继续贯彻以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动，既要搞好粮食生产，又要结合发展其他作物与副产；既要继续加强平原地区的工作与生产，又要积极开发山区经济与海上渔业生产。他表示有把握完成国家所规定的各项指标，如果工作得更好一些，还可能超额完成任务。
    今天会议的执行主席是：赛福鼎、张闻天、马叙伦、蔡廷锴、罗隆基、荣毅仁。
    今天的会议在下午三时开始，七时十五分休会。明天继续进行大会讨论。
