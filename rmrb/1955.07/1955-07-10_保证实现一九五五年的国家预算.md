　　Guarantee the Implementation of the 1955 National Budget

At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, Vice Premier Li Xiannian delivered a "Report on the 1954 National Final Accounts and the 1955 National Budget." Because our country implemented the 1954 budget, we have achieved certain accomplishments in developing the national economy, improving people's lives, and consolidating national defense. The implementation of the 1955 national budget will allow us to achieve further accomplishments in these areas. Therefore, guaranteeing the implementation of the 1955 national budget is the glorious political task of our Party, the government, and the people of the whole country.

The total revenue of the 1955 national budget is 31.19 billion yuan, of which the total current revenue is 28.04 billion yuan. Because our budget revenue is built on the foundation of the continuous development of the national economy, and especially because the revenue from state-owned economy, cooperative economy, and joint state-private economy in the 1955 budget has occupied a major position, that is, it has risen from 70.55 percent in 1954 to 76.22 percent, the revenue of this year's national budget is more solid and reliable. However, it should also be pointed out that, in view of the fact that agriculture in some areas of our country suffered relatively heavy natural disasters in 1954, which affected last year's autumn harvest and a large part of this year's light industrial production, the total current revenue of the 1955 national budget increased less than in 1954, only 6.91 percent, while 1954 increased by more than 20 percent compared to 1953. This situation, on the one hand, shows that we must pay more attention to saving various expenditures this year, and on the other hand, it also shows that there will be no great difficulty in realizing this year's revenue plan. Based on the experience of 1954, as long as we implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, grasp revenue from all aspects, and strive to tap the potential of socialist enterprises, the 1955 budget revenue plan can definitely be completed or overfulfilled.

The current expenditure of the 1955 national budget is 29.73 billion yuan, an increase of 20.72 percent over the 1954 final accounts. There are several reasons for the increase in expenditure. For example, allocating a part of the surplus from the previous year to supplement the working capital of state-owned enterprises is one of the reasons; and a more important reason is that the scale of national construction this year exceeds any previous year. This year, there are 1,079 new and expanded units above the quota in capital construction, including 91 of the 156 important projects designed by the Soviet Union for our country. As a result of the construction, the five central industrial ministries will complete the construction of 67 major construction units or complete some important engineering construction this year. At the same time, in 1955, there will be considerable development in national industrial and agricultural production, transportation, domestic and foreign trade, and cultural and educational undertakings, and people's lives will be further improved. Since it is necessary to carry out such large-scale construction, of course, a lot of investment is needed. This year's budget stipulates that economic construction expenditure accounts for 47.72 percent; the basic construction investment in economic construction plus the basic construction investment in culture, education, and administration totals 9.59 billion yuan, accounting for 32.26 percent of the total budget expenditure, which is all completely necessary. The various allocations of national budget expenditures fully embody the principle of focusing on key construction and the wishes of the people of the whole country for peaceful construction, which is completely in line with the fundamental interests of our country and people.

The revenue and expenditure situation of the 1955 national budget fully shows that our country's budget is healthy. However, no one should be complacent about this, thinking that there is no problem in realizing the 1955 national budget. This idea is extremely wrong. On the one hand, the proportion of this year's revenue increase is small while the proportion of expenditure increase is large, and on the other hand, the total reserve fund stipulated in this year's budget is not sufficient, and unexpected expenditures in large-scale construction are often unavoidable. Therefore, in order to successfully realize the 1955 national budget, we must tightly grasp every link of revenue and expenditure, and there can be no slackness.

Our country's financial revenue work has improved year by year, but there are also some shortcomings. For example, the industrial and commercial tax in 1954 did not complete the plan; although the income of state-owned enterprises exceeded the plan by 19.53 percent, some enterprises did not complete the plan. More than 11 percent of the enterprises under the five central industrial ministries failed to complete their profit plans last year. Enterprises under other transportation, commerce, and agriculture and forestry departments also have the same situation, and some units not only did not make profits, but also had serious losses. The Food Company of the Ministry of Commerce originally planned to turn over 9.9 million yuan in profits, but actually lost more than 20 million yuan, which is a very prominent example. Therefore, if we want to ensure the realization of the 1955 national budget, we must strictly abide by financial discipline. State-owned enterprises must resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of not paying taxes on time and not paying profits on time and according to plan. The financial departments and the competent departments of various enterprises should actively supervise and inspect the finances of state-owned enterprises. The tax authorities and industrial and commercial administrative departments should strengthen the collection and management of taxes. All enterprise employees and the people of the whole country should actively supervise and fight against all phenomena that undermine financial discipline.

The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always attached importance to thrift. As a result of the hard work of the broad masses of employees to increase production and practice economy, the state has saved and increased a sum of wealth every year. But we must never be satisfied with the status quo. We must also see that the phenomenon of waste in expenditure in many departments and enterprises is still very serious. There are wide margins of error, lax accounting, and chaotic expenditure management in the budgets of many departments and many regions. For example, in the past, when compiling budgets, layers of reserves were left, resulting in too much reserve funds. The state has a general reserve fund, and the localities have local reserve funds, and the various departments have also retained reserve funds, and the various bureaus, factories, and mines have reserve funds and other items. Under the current circumstances where our country's plans and budgets are not accurate enough, it was originally possible to leave a part of the reserve fund when setting budget targets at the beginning of the year; but this situation must be changed in the future. Another example is that when formulating investment quotas, they are often added layer by layer, and the estimates are too high. At the end of May this year, the Construction Bank reviewed the budget estimates for 1.18 billion yuan of construction investment and found that the construction cost was overestimated by 87 million yuan, accounting for 7.4 percent of the total budget estimate. In 1954, the Ministry of Education's budget stipulated that the comprehensive expenditure quota for ordinary high schools was 134 yuan per student, but the actual expenditure was only 107 yuan, and the budget exceeded the actual expenditure by about 20 percent. Of course, these surplus funds are not necessarily all wasted, but even if they are all returned to the national treasury at the end of the year, they can no longer exert the effect of investment in that year. This phenomenon of wide margins of error also exists in local budgets. Some localities, on the one hand, cannot use up the budget, and on the other hand, they have to add to the budget. In addition, many department staff lack economic perspectives. When they ask the state for money, they are afraid of not asking for enough, but when using it, they do not pay attention to saving in all links of production, circulation, and procurement. Many departments, when compiling the budget at the beginning of the year, work together from top to bottom, calculating repeatedly, fearing that they have missed any items; but when reporting the final accounts at the end of the year, they only ask the accounting staff to do it, and the heads of the agencies neither carefully review it nor organize appropriate personnel to conduct research. These phenomena show that many people are extremely unserious about the budget, and many departments and enterprises still lack financial supervision. In the future, we must resolutely eliminate this phenomenon in actual work.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings and ensure the realization of the 1955 national budget, we must take various effective measures. First of all, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government over financial work and strive to improve the accuracy of the budget. Now that the Five-Year Plan is about to be finalized, and we have accumulated two and a half years of construction experience, plus the development of the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, these have created conditions for more accurately compiling and implementing the national budget. As long as we attach importance to this work, gradually establish various quotas, and strictly control revenue and expenditure, we will definitely be able to make the execution of this year's budget more accurate and lay the foundation for improving future budget work. Secondly, various financial systems should be improved step by step, and financial supervision should be strengthened. For example, improving the budget final account system, eliminating the phenomena of not being strict, not correct, and not timely in the compilation and submission of budget final accounts; determining the scope and responsibilities of financial management by agencies at all levels; stipulating the powers and responsibilities of accounting officers in charge of various units; and improving financial supervision institutions are all very necessary. Finally, and most importantly, it is necessary to mobilize the power of the broad masses to supervise the implementation of the budget, and to improve various systems through the power of the masses. The team (班组) economic accounting, cost symposiums, final account meetings, and expense inspection meetings currently implemented in some enterprises have proved to be good ways to mobilize the masses, and these methods must be gradually promoted in various enterprise systems.

At present, all parts of the country are thoroughly implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to practice strict economy and launching a mass struggle against waste. As long as the leadership organs at all levels resolutely rely on the masses and strive to improve their work, they will definitely be able to ensure the continuous progress of our country's economic and financial situation and ensure the complete realization of the 1955 national budget.

### 保证实现一九五五年的国家预算

　　保证实现一九五五年的国家预算
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，李先念副总理作了“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”。我们的国家由于实现了一九五四年的预算，在发展国民经济、改善人民生活和巩固国防力量方面已经有一定的成就，而一九五五年的国家预算的实现又将使我们在这些方面得到进一步的成就。因此，保证实现一九五五年的国家预算乃是我们的党、政府和全国人民的光荣的政治任务。
    一九五五年国家预算的总收入为三百一十一亿九千多万元，其中本年收入合计为二百八十亿四千多万元。由于我国预算的收入是建筑在国民经济不断发展的基础上的，特别是在一九五五年预算中来自国营经济、合作社营经济和公私合营经济的收入已占了主要的地位，即由一九五四年的百分之七十点五五上升到百分之七十六点二二，因此，今年国家预算的收入就更加巩固和更加可靠了。但是也应该指出，鉴于一九五四年我国部分地区的农业遭受自然灾害较重，影响了去年的秋收和今年的很大一部分轻工业生产，一九五五年国家预算本年收入合计，比一九五四年增加得较少，只有百分之六点九一，而一九五四年却比一九五三年增加了百分之二十还多。这种情况，一方面说明今年必须更加注意节约各种支出，另一方面也说明实现今年的收入计划将不会有很大的困难。根据一九五四年的经验，只要贯彻增产节约精神，从各方面抓紧收入，努力发掘社会主义企业的潜力，一九五五年的预算收入计划是一定可以完成或超额完成的。
    一九五五年国家预算的本年支出为二百九十七亿三千多万元，比一九五四年的决算增长了百分之二十点七二。支出的增长有几方面的原因。例如把上年度的结余的一部分拨充国营企业的流动资金就是其中的一个原因；而更重要的原因则是今年的国家建设规模超过了以往任何一年。今年基本建设中新建和扩建的限额以上的单位有一千零七十九个，其中包括苏联为我国设计的一百五十六个重要项目中的九十一个。建设的结果，中央五个工业部今年将有六十七个重大建设单位完成建设或完成部分重要工程建设。同时，一九五五年内，全国工农业生产、交通运输、国内外贸易和文化教育事业都有相当的发展，人民生活将有进一步改善。既然要进行这样规模巨大的建设，当然就需要很多投资。今年预算中规定经济建设支出占百分之四十七点七二；经济建设中的基本建设投资加上文教、行政各方面的基本建设投资共达九十五亿九千多万元，占预算支出总数的百分之三十二点二六，这都是完全必要的。国家预算支出的各种分配，完全体现了重点建设的方针和全国人民和平建设的愿望，这是同我们的国家和人民的根本利益完全吻合的。
    一九五五年国家预算的收支情况，充分表明了我国的预算是健康的。但是，任何人都不应该因此自满，以为实现一九五五年国家预算就毫无问题了。这种想法是极端错误的。一方面今年收入增长的比例较小而支出增长的比例较大，另一方面今年预算中规定的总预备费还很不充分，而大规模建设中的意外支出又往往是不可避免的。因此，为了胜利地实现一九五五年的国家预算，我们必须紧紧掌握收入和支出的每一个环节，不能有丝毫的懈怠。
    我国的财政收入工作一年比一年都有进步，但是也还有一些缺点。例如，一九五四年的工商税就没有完成计划；国营企业收入虽然超过了计划百分之十九点五三，但是也有一些企业并没有完成计划。中央五个工业部所属的企业，去年没有完成利润计划的就有百分之十一多。其它交通运输、商业和农林部门所属的企业也同样有这种情况，甚至有些单位不但没有赢利，还有严重的赔损。商业部食品公司原计划上缴利润九百九十万元，实际赔了二千多万元，这就是一个很突出的例子。因此，我们要保证实现一九五五年的国家预算，就必须严格地遵守财政纪律，国营企业必须坚决地消除不按时缴纳税款和不按时、不按计划缴纳利润的现象，财政部门和各企业主管部门应当积极进行对国营企业财务的监督和检查，税务机关和工商行政部门应该加强税收的稽征和管理工作，各企业职工和全国人民都应该积极地向一切破坏财政纪律的现象进行监督和斗争。
    中国共产党和人民政府一贯是重视节约的，由于广大职工群众努力增产节约的结果，国家每年都节省和增加了一笔财富。但是我们绝不能满足于现状。我们也要看到，许多部门和企业单位在经费支出方面的浪费现象也仍然是很严重的，许多部门和许多地区的预算都存在宽打窄用、核算不严和经费支出管理混乱的现象。例如，过去编预算的时候层层留后备，以致后备金太多。国家既有总预备费，地方又有地方预备费，各部门还保留了准备金，各局各厂矿又有预备费等项目。在目前我国的计划和预算都还不够准确的情况下，年初订预算指标的时候，留一部分准备金本来是可以的；但这种情况在今后则必须加以改变。又如制定投资定额的时候，往往层层追加，估得过高。建设银行今年五月底对十一亿八千万元建筑投资的概算进行了审查，就发现高估造价八千七百万元，占概算总数的百分之七点四。一九五四年教育部预算规定普通高中的综合支出定额为每个学生一百三十四元，实际只支出了一百零七元，预算超过实际支出百分之二十左右。当然，这些多余的资金，不一定都是浪费了，可是，即使到年终全部缴还国库，它已经不能在当年发挥投资效果了。这种宽打窄用的现象，在地方预算中也同样存在。有些地方一方面预算用不完，一方面还要追加预算。此外，有很多部门的工作人员缺乏经济观点，他们在向国家要钱的时候，惟恐不多，而在使用时，对生产、流转、采购的各个环节却不注意节约。有不少部门，在年初编预算的时候，上下一齐动手，反复计算，惟恐遗漏了任何项目；而在年终上报决算的时候，就只叫会计人员去做，机关首长既不认真审查，也不组织适当人员去进行研究。这些现象说明了不少人对预算是极不严肃的，不少部门和企业还极其缺乏财政监督。今后必须在实际工作中坚决肃清这种现象。
    为了克服以上种种缺点，保证实现一九五五年的国家预算，我们必须采取各种有效的办法。首先必须加强党和政府对财政工作的领导，努力提高预算的准确性。现在五年计划即将确定，我们又已积累了两年半的建设经验，加上广大群众的增产节约运动的开展，这些都为更准确地编制和执行国家预算创造了条件。只要重视这项工作，逐步地建立起各种定额，严格地掌握收支，我们就一定能使今年预算的执行更加准确，并为改进今后的预算工作奠定基础。其次，应当有步骤地健全各种财政制度，加强财政监督。例如改善预算决算制度，消除预算决算编制和报送的不严格、不正确、不及时等现象；确定各级机关管理财政的范围和责任；规定各单位会计主管人员的职权和责任；健全财政监督机构等等，都是十分必要的。最后，也是最重要的，就是必须动员广大群众的力量来监督预算的执行，并且经过群众的力量来健全各种制度。目前在一部分企业中实行的班组经济核算、成本座谈会、决算会议和费用检查会议，证明都是发动群众的好办法，必须使这些办法在各企业系统中逐步推广起来。
    目前全国各地正在深入地贯彻党中央和国务院厉行节约的指示，展开群众性的反浪费斗争，各级领导机关只要坚决地依靠群众，努力改进工作，就
  一定能够保证我国的经济状况和财政状况的不断进步，保证一九五五年国家预算的完全实现。
