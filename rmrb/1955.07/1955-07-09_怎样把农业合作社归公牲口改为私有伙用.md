How to Change the Public Livestock of Agricultural Cooperatives to Private Shared Use
Shi Qingxiang, Secretary of the Xuanhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the process of consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, based on the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and adopting methods tailored to each cooperative, some of the draft animals and carts that had been valued and transferred to the cooperative in the past were changed to private shared use. In the nineteen cooperatives in the fourth, eighth, and ninth districts, one hundred draft animals, five carts, and rubber-wheeled carts have been safely transferred to private shared use, and the masses have responded very well. The cooperative members felt much relieved because they had reduced a huge amount of debt; the livestock owners were even happier.

The biggest obstacle encountered in carrying out this work was the ideological resistance of grassroots staff. Some district and township staff members believed: "We were the ones who advocated for livestock to be priced and transferred to the cooperative. If we return them to the original owners, we have to go and explain it ourselves. Isn't this like slapping ourselves in the face!" Some key members of the cooperatives also worried: "If the cooperative doesn't have livestock, we won't have anything to rely on. If the livestock remains privately owned, what if people don't let us use it in times of urgent need?" Some said: "It's good for the cooperative to have livestock to use. What are we afraid of if we don't have money to repay the debt?" There were many similar ideological obstacles, and many staff members did not dare to publicize the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit in dealing with livestock and cart issues.

In order to break down these ideological obstacles, we adopted the method of concrete accounting:

In the Heping Agricultural Cooperative of Yangfang Township in the third district, we helped the key members of the cooperative and the masses of members to calculate the income and expenditure accounts of the cooperative. This calculation surprised the key members of the cooperative and the members, and they felt that this problem must be solved immediately. This cooperative has sixteen households and three hundred and eighty-two mu of land. The total annual income is estimated to be 298.6 shi; each shi is calculated at ten yuan, totaling 2,986 yuan. Returning 800 yuan for fertilizer, seeds, and other investments, and then deducting 503 yuan (including principal and interest) for the depreciation of vehicles and horses to be returned this year, and 109 yuan for bank loans, these few items alone account for 47 percent of the total income. Adding the public grain, it will account for more than half of the total income. Calculated in this way, the income of many households will be reduced compared to the past. "Running a cooperative is for everyone to have a good life. How can we allow some members to have reduced income as a result of this?" The key members of the cooperative suddenly realized. Everyone immediately decided to change the livestock to private rental.

At a staff meeting in the fifth district, the situation of private shared use of livestock in the Shiqiang Agricultural Cooperative was compared with the situation of the Nanjie Agricultural Cooperative, which prematurely priced and transferred livestock to the cooperative: The livestock under private shared use is strong and easy to use, does not lack fodder, and the cooperative leaders are relatively worry-free in this regard, so production is better. What about the livestock that has been valued and transferred to the public? Two of the five have already died, and those that haven't died are much thinner than before they joined the cooperative. Moreover, the cooperative leaders are running around all day buying grass and fodder, and are so worried that they can't lead production well, and the members are also very uneasy. After this comparison, the comrades who attended the meeting clarified the truth, and the livestock of the three cooperatives in Dayingpan were soon changed to private shared use.

In the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Xujiabao Village, an account was also calculated for the losses caused by the lack of collective management experience. After this cooperative transferred the rubber-wheeled cart to the public, it broke seven sets of beads in four months, spending 130 yuan; after the livestock was transferred to the public, because there was no collective feeding and collective use experience, not only was more fodder spent, but also less work was done than before joining the cooperative. All in all, several hundred yuan was lost in half a year, and a lot of labor was wasted. The members increased their burden and their concerns. After this calculation, everyone realized the harm of "setting up a big stall" and "putting on a show," and decided to return the livestock and carts to private ownership and rent them to the cooperative.

Experience has proved that the method of concrete accounting is persuasive. We have adopted this method in many agricultural cooperatives and have achieved good results.

In the process of changing the public livestock to private ownership, many specific problems were also encountered. These problems were mainly solved through democratic consultation. Regarding the issue of pregnant livestock, most cooperatives adopted the method of dividing the offspring proportionally between the entire cooperative and the livestock owner after consultation. Regarding the issue of livestock prices, generally, the original price was paid and the original owner took them back; for those that were too thin, the cooperative compensated for the loss (borne by the land acreage). Of course, there are many troubles in changing to private ownership. In addition to the above issues, attention should also be paid to overcoming the contradiction between public use and private use, and the contradiction between feeding and using; these problems should also be solved through democratic consultation.

　　怎样把农业合作社归公牲口改为私有伙用
　　中共宣化县委书记　史庆祥
    河北省宣化县在整顿农业生产合作社中，根据自愿互利的原则，采取因社制宜的办法，把过去已经折价归社的一部分耕畜、大车，改变成了私有伙用。在第四、第八、第九三个区的十九个社内，已经稳妥地把一百头耕畜、五辆大车和胶轮车转为私有伙用，群众反映很好。社员们因为减少了一笔巨额债务，感到轻松了好多；牲口主们更是高兴。
    在进行这个工作的时候，遇到的最大阻碍是基层工作人员的思想牴触。一些区乡工作人员认为：牲口作价入社是我们叫闹的，退回原主还要我们去说，这不是自己打自己嘴巴吗！社里有些骨干分子也担心：社里没牲口就没抓闹，牲口仍归私有，急用时人家不让用怎么办？有的说：“社里有牲口使就好，债务没有钱就不还，怕什么？”类似的思想阻碍很多，许多工作人员不敢宣传处理牲口、大车问题的自愿互利原则。
    为了打破这些思想障碍，我们采用了具体算账的办法：
    在第三区羊坊乡和平农业合作社，我们帮助社内骨干分子和社员群众算了社内收入和支出账。这一算，使社内骨干分子和社员们都大吃一惊，感到这问题非马上解决不可。这个社共有十六户，三百八十二亩土地。全年总收入估计为二百九十八点六石；每石以十元计共折款二千九百八十六元。归还肥料、种籽等投资八百元，再除去本年应归还的车马折价（连本带利）五百零三元，归还银行贷款一百零九元，仅这几项就占去了总收入的百分之四十七。再加上公粮，就要占总收入的大半。这样算下来，很多户的收入要比过去减少。“办社是为了大家过好日子，这一闹把一些社员反而弄得减少收入，怎么能行？”社里的骨干分子恍然大悟了。大家立即决定把牲口改为私有租用。
    在第五区的一次工作人员会议上，把石墙农业合作社私有伙用牲口的情形同南街农业合作社过早地把牲口折价归社的情形作了对比：私有伙用的牲口又壮又好使，既不缺草料，社里的领导人员在这方面也比较省心，生产搞得比较好。折价归公的牲口呢？五头已经死掉两头，没死的也比未入社前瘦多了，而且社内领导人员成天东奔西跑买草弄料，愁得没法，不能很好地领导生产，社员们也很不安心。这样一对比，到会的同志们都弄清了道理，随后大营盘三个社的牲口很快也改成了私有伙用。
    在许家堡村第二农业合作社，还算了由于没有集体经营经验所造成的损失账。这个社把胶轮车归公以后，四个月里就用坏了七套珠子，花了一百三十元；牲口归公以后，因为没有集体喂养和集体使用的经验，不但多费草料，而且比入社前少做很多活。里外一合算，半年来赔了几百元，而且浪费了许多人工。社员们增加了负担，也增加了顾虑。这样一算，大家都认识了“摆大摊子”“闹排场”的害处，决定把牲口和大车改归私有，由社租用。
    经验证明：具体算账的办法是有说服力的。我们在许多农业合作社采用了这个办法，都收到了很好的效果。
    在把归公的牲口改归私有的过程中，还碰到了许多具体问题。对于这些问题，主要是采取民主协商的方法解决的。对牲口怀驹问题，大部分社在经过协商后采取了由全社和畜主双方按比例分的办法。对畜价问题，一般是原价原主拉回；瘦弱得太厉害的，由社内补偿损失（按地亩负担）。当然，改归私有是有许多麻烦的，除了以上这些问题以外，还要注意克服公用和私用的矛盾，喂养和使用的矛盾；这些问题，也都应当采取民主协商的办法来解决。
