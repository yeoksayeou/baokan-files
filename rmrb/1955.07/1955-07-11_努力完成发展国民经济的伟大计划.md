As a representative of the National People's Congress, I believe our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is of great historical significance. Upon its completion, our socialist industrialization will have a preliminary foundation, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce will achieve great success; simultaneously, the people's cultural level will also be correspondingly raised. This not only concerns the current national economy and the people's livelihood but also the welfare of our future generations. After reading this great plan and looking forward to the prosperous and happy socialist society that is about to arrive in our country, I cannot help but feel infinitely excited.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen struggled throughout his life, aiming to achieve freedom, equality, and happiness for the people in China. In his "National Reconstruction Program," there is a huge "Industrial Plan" to carry out large-scale economic construction in China, which is intended to achieve the goal of people's happiness. When Mr. Liao Zhongkai and I followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in engaging in revolution, we eagerly hoped that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal could be realized. The "First Plan" in that "Industrial Plan" was translated into Chinese from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's original English manuscript by Mr. Liao Zhongkai, Mr. Zhu Zhixin, and others. However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal never became a reality. History clearly tells us that in the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, any large-scale plan for developing industry was impossible to realize; only after the Chinese people's revolution, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, had achieved a great victory, and China had achieved the goals of freedom and equality, could such a large-scale economic construction as the first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy be carried out. Recalling the unrealized "Industrial Plan" of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, all those who followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen and remained loyal to the revolution will feel that this Five-Year Plan of our country is extremely precious.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is even more complete than the "Industrial Plan" in the "National Reconstruction Program." It clearly defines the construction policy of socialist industrialization, and takes the basic construction of heavy industry as the key point, which is very correct. Chairman Mao said profoundly and vividly: "Without industry, there is no consolidated national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." To realize industrialization in our country, we must take the socialist road; to enable industrialization to be completed rapidly, we must vigorously develop heavy industry. This has been completely confirmed by the construction experience of the Soviet Union.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of industrial construction, agriculture should also have corresponding development. Our country's Five-Year Plan takes into account the difficulties that may arise from agriculture lagging behind the rapid development of industry, and strives to maintain an appropriate ratio between the development of industry and agriculture to avoid disconnection between them, which is also very correct. Our country has a large population, and if we do not work hard to develop agriculture, the supply of grain will fall short of demand. At present, there are still many uncultivated wastelands in various provinces of our country. In order to develop agriculture, this Five-Year Plan has decided to use all possible conditions to work hard to reclaim wasteland and plant a large amount of grains and industrial raw materials, which is very necessary. Our country's territory stretches into the tropics in the south and approaches the frigid zone in the north. In addition to being suitable for developing general agriculture, it can also grow a wide variety of cash crops, including many specialties of the tropics and subtropics. There are very few countries in the world with such superior conditions. We must not fail to live up to this natural condition, but should conduct in-depth research, fully utilize it, and vigorously develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries to support industrial construction.

Last year, the Yangtze River and Huai River experienced unprecedented floods, and Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi experienced continuous and severe droughts, and the harvest of grain was inevitably affected to a certain extent, but the grain needed in urban and rural areas of our country has always been guaranteed to be supplied, which shows that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is correct. In order to continue to ensure market stability, and to support industrial construction, so that this Five-Year Plan can be carried out smoothly, the people of the whole country should support this policy.

In order to guarantee the victorious realization of this Five-Year Plan, it is also necessary, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to continuously consolidate the people's democratic united front of all nationalities based on the worker-peasant alliance. All democratic parties and all patriotic people who participate in this united front should contribute their own strength, strive to participate in agricultural production, support industrial construction, and ensure the victorious completion of this Five-Year Plan.

Overseas Chinese have long hoped for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, and many overseas Chinese have even planned to start industries in the motherland. However, in the era of old China, all these hopes and plans fell through. Now, due to the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, the overseas Chinese's hopes for the prosperity and strength of the motherland will not only never fail, but the realization of this wish is just around the corner. At the same time, overseas Chinese have also had sufficient favorable conditions to participate in construction in the motherland, so the vast number of overseas Chinese will definitely warmly support this Five-Year Plan.

Although our country's large-scale economic construction has received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, we must rely on internal accumulation to obtain a large amount of construction funds, so all organs, enterprises, and even the people of the whole country should practice strict economy and oppose waste. Everyone should do their best and use practical actions to support this Five-Year Plan. Actively saving and subscribing to public bonds is one of the concrete manifestations of supporting this Five-Year Plan. Everyone should strictly restrain themselves: do not waste a single cent of the country's funds. Everyone should also encourage themselves: in the great construction of implementing this Five-Year Plan, give one point of heat and give off one point of light!

For the prosperity of the motherland, for the welfare of the people, and for the bright future of our future generations, we must victoriously complete and even over fulfill our country's first Five-Year Plan!

    努力完成发展国民经济的伟大计划
    全国人民代表大会代表  何香凝
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划是具有伟大的历史意义的。这个计划完成以后，我国的社会主义工业化就有了初步的基础，农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造也将有很大的成就；同时人民的文化水平也将相应地提高。这不仅有关当前的国计民生，也关系到我们后代的福利。我看了这个伟大的计划，瞻望我国即将到来的繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，禁不住无限兴奋。
    孙中山先生一生奋斗，目的在求中国的自由平等和民生幸福。他所著的“建国方略”中，有一个巨大的“实业计划”，要在中国进行大规模的经济建设，这就是为着达到民生幸福的目的。我和廖仲恺先生当年追随孙中山先生从事革命的时候，曾经迫切地期望孙中山先生这个理想能够实现。那个“实业计划”中的“第一个计划”就是廖仲恺先生和朱执信先生等从孙中山先生的英文原稿译成中文的。但是孙中山先生这个理想从来没有成为事实。历史明白地告诉我们：在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，任何大规模的发展实业的计划都是不可能实现的；只有到了中国人民革命在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下取得伟大的胜利，中国已经达到自由平等的目的，像发展国民经济的第一个五年计划这样规模宏大的经济建设才有可能进行。回忆了孙中山先生“实业计划”没有成就，凡是追随过孙中山先生而忠于革命的人们，当会觉得我国这个五年计划是十分珍贵的。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，比“建国方略”中的“实业计划”更加完善。它明确了社会主义工业化的建设方针，把重工业的基本建设作为重点，这是很正确的。毛主席很深刻而生动地说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”要在我国实现工业化，就非走社会主义的道路不可；要使工业化能够迅速地完成，就一定要大力发展重工业。这是苏联的建设经验所完全证实了的。
    为了保证工业建设的顺利完成，农业也应该有相应的发展。我国这个五年计划估计到农业落后于工业的迅速发展而可能发生的困难，力求使工业和农业的发展保持适当的比例，避免彼此脱节，这也是很正确的。我国人口众多，如果不努力发展农业，粮食就会供不应求。现在我国各省还有不少未开垦的荒地，为了发展农业，这个五年计划决定利用一切可能的条件，努力开荒，大量种植谷物及工业原料，这是很必要的。我国的领土，南部伸入热带，北部接近寒带，除了适宜于发展一般的农业，还可以种植多种多样的经济作物，包括热带和亚热带的许多特产。世界上是很少有这样优越条件的国家的。我们不要辜负这种天然条件，而应该深刻研究，充分加以利用，大力发展农林畜牧事业，以便支援工业建设。
    去年长江、淮河发生百年来未有的大水，广东、福建、广西又连续发生严重的旱灾，粮食的收获不免受到一定的影响，但是我国城乡各地所需要的粮食，始终能够保证供应，这说明粮食统购统销的政策是正确的。为了继续保证市场的稳定，为了支援工业建设，使这个五年计划能够顺利进行，全国人民都应该拥护这个政策。
    为了保证这个五年计划的胜利实现，还必须在中国共产党的领导下，不断地巩固以工农联盟为基础的全国各民族的人民民主统一战线。参加这个统一战线的各民主党派以及一切爱国人士，都应该贡献出自己的力量，努力参加农业生产，支援工业建设，保证这个五年计划的胜利完成。
    华侨长期地期望祖国富强，有不少华侨还曾经计划在祖国兴办实业。但是在旧中国的时代，所有这些期望和计划都落空了。现在，由于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的实施，华侨对于祖国富强的期望不但绝不会落空，这种愿望的实现已经计日可待了。同时，华侨在祖国参加建设事业也已经有了充分的有利条件，因此广大的华侨一定是会热烈地拥护这个五年计划的。
    我国进行大规模的经济建设，虽然有了苏联和各人民民主国家无私的帮助，但是我们必须依靠内部的积累来取得大量的建设资金，所以全国一切机关、企业部门，以至全国人民，都应该厉行节约，反对浪费。大家应该尽各人的力量，用实际行动来拥护这个五年计划。踊跃储蓄和认购公债，就是拥护这个五年计划的具体表现之一。每一个人都应该严肃地约束自己：不要浪费国家一分的资金。每一个人还应该勉励自己：在实行这个五年计划的伟大建设中，有一分热，发一分光！
    为了祖国的富强，为了人民的福利，为了我们后代的美好前途，我们一定要胜利地完成以至超额完成我国第一个五年计划！
