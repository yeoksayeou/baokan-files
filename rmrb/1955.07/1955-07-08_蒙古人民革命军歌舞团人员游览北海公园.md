Members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble Visit Beihai Park

(Our newspaper reports) The entire delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble visited Beihai Park on the morning of the 7th in Beijing.

As soon as the honored guests entered the park gate, they encountered a group of children from the Kindergarten of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. They immediately picked up the children, kissed them over and over, and were reluctant to put them down. The honored guests loved everything about China, and asked about everything. Many people also took notes. They climbed to the top of the White Pagoda and gazed for a long time at the picturesque scenery of Beijing. Major General Damdin Hoshuu and others also visited the Children's Palace. Yan Liqin, a first-year student from Hebei Beijing Middle School, saw the honored guests and quickly took off his red scarf and tied it around Major General Damdin Hoshuu's neck. Major General Damdin Hoshuu also warmly gave Yan Liqin a medal of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association and pinned it on his chest. The honored guests were very interested in the Nine-Dragon Wall. They took many photos and invited Chinese friends to take photos with them as souvenirs. While visiting, the Mongolian friends constantly used the new Chinese words they had learned: "Hello!" to greet the tourists in the park. As they were about to leave the park, the honored guests were discovered by a group of students from the Central Institute of Physical Education and Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School. The students held the hands of the guests from afar, jumping and bouncing with joy. Everyone took many photos together and exchanged correspondence addresses before reluctantly parting.

　　蒙古人民革命军歌舞团人员游览北海公园
    本报讯　蒙古人民革命军歌舞团全体团员七日上午在北京游览北海公园。
    贵宾们一进公园大门，就遇到中央燃料工业部幼儿园一群孩子，他们马上把孩子抱起来，亲了又亲，舍不得放下来。贵宾们看见中国的什么都喜爱，什么都要问问，很多人还记了笔记。他们登上白塔顶上，很久地眺望那像图画一样的北京市景。达姆丁呼少将等人还参观了少年之家。河北北京中学初中一年级学生阎立钦看见贵宾来了，忙把自己的红领巾拿下来，给达姆丁呼少将系在颈上。达姆丁呼少将也热情地把一枚蒙中友协纪念章给阎立钦挂在胸前。贵宾们对九龙壁非常感兴趣，他们拍了很多像片，而且邀中国朋友一同和他们拍照留念。蒙古友人一面游览，一面还不断地用新学的中国话：“你好！”和公园里的游人打招呼。临离开公园时，贵宾们被一群中央体育学院和北京女二中的学生发现了，学生们拉着远方来的客人的手，喜得又跳又蹦。大伙在一起照了很多像，还写了双方的通信地址，才依依不舍地分手。
