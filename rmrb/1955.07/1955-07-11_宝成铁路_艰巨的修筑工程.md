    Baoji-Chengdu Railway—An Arduous Construction Project
    Ye Xin
    The strategically vital Qinling and Bashan Mountains stand tall between the provinces of Shaanxi and Sichuan. Within these continuous mountains lie crisscrossing rivers of all sizes. This has been one of the most difficult regions to traverse in China since ancient times. The great poet Li Bai described the perilous nature of entering Sichuan as: "The road to Shu is harder than ascending to the sky." In order to pass through this area, the people of ancient China planted wooden stakes on cliffs and precipices, erected planks, and built the famous "plank roads."
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, currently under construction, passes through this very region.
    Before liberation, the only connection between the Southwest and Northwest was the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway. Since its opening, this highway has been plagued by various dangerous accidents; some cars, due to a moment's carelessness on the part of the driver, would be smashed in the deep valleys. Therefore, the fertile province of Sichuan remained in a state of semi-isolation from the rest of the country, unable to export large quantities of grain or import machinery in significant amounts. This situation could not continue during our period of large-scale economic construction. The state began surveying and constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway here in 1952. This railway is a major artery connecting North and South China, and it will draw the rich mineral and agricultural products of Shaanxi and Sichuan into the nation's construction efforts, greatly contributing to the development of the interior.
    The route was determined after multiple surveys and repeated considerations. Several different proposals were considered at the time. Some proposals advocated lengthening the route to avoid these steep mountains and rapid rivers. However, extending the route would be detrimental to future transportation; the losses in transport capacity and transportation costs over continuous years of operation would be incalculable. Therefore, for the sake of future transportation savings, to maximize economic impact, and to fully utilize the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway for convenient construction, the final selected route, though challenging, was the shorter one. This was a bold choice, one that only a government as powerful as ours would dare to make, one that dares to defy mountains, rapids, and all other difficulties.
    We can imagine how arduous and complex the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project must be.
    The starting point of the railway, Baoji, is located on the north bank of the Wei River; the majestic Qinling Mountains rise on the south bank. If the railway were to pass straight through, it would need to ascend 800 meters within a distance of 20 kilometers. Such a steep gradient is not permissible according to current scientific standards. Therefore, in order to cross the Qinling Mountains, the route must wind back and forth through the mountains, gradually ascending. Beyond the peak of the Qinling Mountains lies the treacherous Jialing River canyon. The railway needs to cross the river sixteen times to find its way, sometimes traveling along the cliffs of the riverbank, sometimes diverting the river and filling in the riverbed to pass through. Finally, the route reaches Chengdu after crossing the "natural barrier" of Jianmen Mountain. On the route map, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is a railway that is curved everywhere. In one section, the straight-line distance is only 800 meters, but the route winds for 13 kilometers. In some places, three lines can be seen, and a train can be seen three times in one location. On the completed Baoji-Chengdu Railway, trains will alternately circle the mountaintops and valleys, appearing and disappearing from east to west.
    Because the route continuously passes through mountains and crosses gullies, it requires the constant excavation of tunnels, erection of bridges, splitting of mountain peaks, and filling of deep gullies, resulting in a large number of bridges, tunnels, and earthwork projects. According to statistics, on average, each kilometer of the line has 81,000 cubic meters of roadbed earthwork, 114 meters of tunnels (accounting for 11.4% of the total length), more than 11 meters of large bridges, and 1.6 medium and small bridges. Tunnels account for 36% of the length of the line from Baoji to Donghe Bridge. Many places have tunnels and bridges connected, and even some stations need to be partially located in tunnels or on bridges. The longest tunnel (Qinling Tunnel) is more than 2,000 meters long. Many tunnels are curved. In order to utilize local materials, a large number of stone arch bridges are used throughout the line, with very strict technical requirements. The complexity of the terrain means that many projects must be carried out on steep mountains or cliffs, making working conditions extremely difficult and material transportation even more challenging.
    The vast workforce constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway overcame the difficulties they encountered with their tenacious efforts and heroic labor. Disregarding strong winds, heavy snow, scorching sun, and rain, they used ropes to suspend themselves on cliffs to excavate rocks and clear the roadbed. According to extremely incomplete statistics from 1954, the workforce on the entire line proposed more than 9,000 rationalization suggestions to improve work. Many migrant workers who had never seen tunnels before have become excellent pneumatic drill operators, many workers who did not understand surveying knowledge have mastered the direction of curved tunnel excavation, and some workers who had never built stone structures have become skilled at building large stone arch bridges. The advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union played a huge guiding role in solving many complex problems in the project. The excavation of complex tunnels, the design and construction of stone arch bridges, and the blasting of large amounts of earthwork have all benefited from advanced Soviet experience. The degree of mechanization in construction is constantly improving, and many heavy and labor-intensive tasks are being carried out by mechanical operation.
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is more than 680 kilometers long. Construction began from Chengdu northward in the autumn of 1952, and the 300-plus kilometers from Chengdu to Guangyuan are now open to traffic. Currently, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is undergoing comprehensive construction. On the 300-plus kilometers of line from Baoji to Guangyuan, tens of thousands of people are engaged in intense labor on mountain peaks, valley floors, and steep cliffs. Bridge piers dozens of meters high have been erected in valleys and river surfaces, and neat roadbeds have been built on many hillsides. At night, tens of thousands of lights illuminate the line, and tunnel and bridge construction continue as usual. The railway workers are heroically completing the great task entrusted to them by the people of the motherland. (Attached pictures)

    宝成铁路——艰巨的修筑工程
    也辛
    形势险要的秦岭和巴山屹立在陕西和四川两省。在那绵延不断的群山中，有纵横交错的大小河流。这是我国自古以来最难通行的地区之一。伟大的诗人李白形容进入四川的艰险情况是：“蜀道之难，难于上青天”。我国古代人民，为了通过这里，曾在悬崖峭壁上栽下木桩，架起木板，修筑了有名的“栈道”。
    眼前正在修筑的宝成铁路，就从这里经过。
    解放前联系西南和西北的只有一条川陕公路。这条公路从通车后就不断发生各种惊险的事故，有些汽车因司机稍一不慎就被摔碎在深谷中。因此，富饶的四川同外地的陆上联系仍然处在半隔绝状态，大宗粮食不能输出，机器不能大量运入。这种状况，在我国进行大规模经济建设时期，是不能继续存在下去了。从一九五二年国家就开始在这里进行宝成铁路的勘测和修筑的工作。这条铁路，是贯通我国内地南北交通的大动脉，它将把陕西、四川两省富饶的矿产和农产品吸引到国家的建设事业中来，大大有助于内地建设事业的发展。
    这条线路的确定是经过多次勘测，反复考虑的。当时曾有几种不同的方案。有的方案主张把线路延长，避开这些险峻的山峰和急湍的河流。但是线路的延长对将来的运输是不利的，在常年不断的运输中，运输力和运输费用的损失是不可计算的。因此，为了将来运输上的节省，为了更大地发挥经济上的作用，为了充分利用川陕公路便利施工，最后选定的这条工程虽然艰巨，但距离却是比较短的线路。这是一个勇敢的选择，只有像我们这样充满了力量的政府才敢于做出这样勇敢的选择，才敢于蔑视高山、激流等一切困难。
    我们可以想像到，宝成路的工程该是如何的艰巨和复杂。
    铁路的起点宝鸡在渭河北岸；渭河南岸就是雄伟的秦岭。铁路如果要直线通过，就需要在二十公里的距离内升高八百公尺。这么大的坡度，根据现今科学的要求，还是不能允许的。因此，为了越过秦岭，线路就只好在这一带的群山中来回盘绕，逐步上升。越过秦岭顶峰，就是险峻的嘉陵江峡谷，铁路需要在江上跨越十六次，找寻去路，有时在江边悬崖上穿行，有时把河赶开，把河床填起通过。最后，线路在越过剑门山“天险”后到达成都。在线路图上，宝成路是一条无处不弯曲的铁路。其中有一段直线距离仅八百公尺，线路却绕了十三公里。有的地方可以看到三条线路，一列火车可以在一个地方看到三次。在修成的宝成路上，火车将是一会在山顶盘旋，一会在河谷环绕，忽东忽西，时隐时现。
    由于线路接连不断地穿山、跨沟，需要不断地开凿隧道，架设桥梁，劈开山峰，填平深沟，这就出现了数量很大的桥梁隧道和土石方工程。据统计全线平均每公里有路基土石方八万一千方，隧道一百一十四公尺（占全长百分之十一点四），大桥十一公尺多，中小桥一点六座。宝鸡到东河桥一段隧道占线路长的百分之三十六。许多地方都是隧道桥梁相接连，甚至连车站也需要有一部分设在隧道里或桥梁上。最长的隧道（秦岭隧道）长二千多公尺。许多隧道都是弯曲的。为了就地取材，全线大量采用石拱桥，技术要求十分严格。地形的复杂使许多工程都要在险峻的山头上或悬崖绝壁间进行，工作条件极为艰苦，材料运送更加困难。
    修筑宝成路的广大职工，以自己的顽强努力、英勇劳动战胜了遇到的困难。他们不顾狂风大雪，日晒雨淋，用绳子把自己吊在悬崖上，开凿山石，辟出路基。据一九五四年极不完全的统计，全线职工为改进工作提出的合理化建议就有九千多件。许多从来没有见过隧道的民工已成了优秀的风钻开山工，许多不懂测量常识的工人已掌握了弯曲隧道的开挖方向，有些从未砌过石头的工人也成了砌大石拱桥的能手了。苏联的先进科学技术对解决工程中的许多复杂问题，起了极大的指导作用。复杂隧道的开挖，石拱桥的设计和施工，大量土石方的爆破，都得到了苏联先进经验的帮助。施工中的机械化程度在不断提高，许多笨重的、人力难以胜任的劳动都采用机械操作。
    宝成铁路全长六百八十多公里，从一九五二年秋季即从成都往北修筑，现在成都到广元三百多公里已经通车。眼前，宝成路正进行全面施工。由宝鸡到广元三百多公里的线路上，十几万人正在山巅、谷底、峭壁悬崖间进行紧张的劳动。高达数十公尺的桥墩已经在沟谷、河面树立起来，许多山腰里已筑好了整齐的路基。夜间沿线万点灯光，隧道、桥梁照常施工。筑路工人正在英勇地完成祖国人民交给他们的伟大任务。（附图片）
