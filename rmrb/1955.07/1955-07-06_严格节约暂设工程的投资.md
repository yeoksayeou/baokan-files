Editorial: Strictly Economize on Investment in Temporary Construction Projects

　　Strictly economizing on investment in temporary construction projects is an important aspect of economizing in capital construction. Temporary construction projects include various processing plants and repair shops, temporary water sources and water pipelines, temporary substations and power transmission lines, as well as transportation roads, parking lots, warehouses, offices, dormitories, canteens, and so on. The amount of construction for these projects is large, and they are demolished after being used for a short period. Currently, there is a great deal of waste in this area, and the potential for savings is also significant.

　　The prominent manifestations of waste in temporary construction projects are: standards are too high, the amount of construction is too much, and planning is too chaotic. For example, some construction units always calculate the production capacity of auxiliary enterprises according to the highest needs of construction; when building offices, dormitories, and canteens, they always base the standards on the number of people during the peak of construction, and also assume that workers are not skilled and need to add more people, and that there will be rush work requiring more people, and so on. As a result, processing plants and repair shops are blindly expanded, and it is unnecessarily requested to build lime warehouses with wooden floors, open-air parking lots with concrete floors, temporary roads with crushed stone asphalt, and so on. The temporary offices, dormitories, and canteens of many construction units are brick and wood structures with cement floors, glass doors and windows, single-layer beds, whitewashed interiors, and complete electric lighting and running water. Some construction departments also blindly plan to build family dormitories and beautiful clubs on construction sites for highly mobile construction workers. In addition, some construction departments do not pay attention to construction preparation and start work without proper planning of the construction site. As a result, some temporary construction projects are built on construction sites and have to be demolished midway; others are built far away from the construction site, increasing transportation costs. In several areas where industrial construction is concentrated, construction units belonging to different departments do not communicate with each other and each does its own thing, failing to reasonably jointly construct and use certain temporary construction projects, which also causes great waste.

　　The reason why such waste occurs in temporary construction projects is that some people do not consider China's specific situation, and they isolate themselves from China's current labor productivity and improve the living and welfare conditions of workers in isolation. These are all subjective ideas; these all hinder the development of social productive forces and hinder socialist accumulation.

　　According to statistics, investment in temporary construction projects accounts for about 5 percent of capital construction investment, which is a considerable expenditure. In order to reduce construction costs, it is necessary to practice strict economy in this area, which is beyond dispute. Moreover, as the name suggests, temporary construction projects are only temporarily used during construction, and they are demolished after the completion of new enterprises. In this case, the higher the construction standards, the more that is built, then the greater the waste, is this not very obvious? Therefore, all construction departments should quickly change their past practices and use a strict spirit of economy to use the state's valuable funds. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to practice strict economy and overcome waste, all newly built temporary construction projects in the future should be as simple as possible under the condition of ensuring construction, actively reduce construction standards, reduce the amount of construction, and save investment in temporary construction projects; the temporary construction projects that have been built in the past few years and can still be used now should strive to continue to use all or most of them, and maximize the economic effect of investment. As long as we pay attention to these two aspects, we can save a lot of funds for the country.

　　There are many ways to save investment in temporary construction projects. But construction personnel need to use their brains to think, need to go to the construction site to conduct field research, and do not think that saving is not great and do not go to save. For example, building and using permanent projects in advance can avoid building or reduce the construction of many temporary projects. Fully utilizing local existing houses, existing industrial enterprises, and urban construction projects can also reduce the number of temporary construction projects. If the construction is organized more evenly, auxiliary enterprises can be built smaller, and temporary dormitories can be built less. There are also some capital construction projects with relatively small workload, low technical requirements, and uneconomical use of prefabricated components, so it is not necessary to build auxiliary enterprises at all. When the First Ministry of Machine Building reviewed the design budgets of the four new factories under its jurisdiction, it only adopted one of the above methods—building staff dormitories in advance to replace temporary dormitories and temporary buildings for construction workers, and building some factory buildings and factory warehouses in advance to replace temporary warehouses and temporary processing plants, which can reduce the construction of 50 percent of temporary dormitories and temporary buildings, and reduce the construction of 20 percent of temporary warehouses and temporary processing plants, totaling more than 2.5 million yuan.

　　After careful calculation and maximum reduction, there will still be a part of temporary construction projects that must be built; the construction standards of this part of temporary construction projects should be greatly reduced. The State Council stipulates that the cost per square meter of general temporary projects is 9 to 12 yuan in the south and 15 to 17 yuan in the north. Now the experience of some units proves that temporary construction projects can also be built at a lower cost than this standard. The First Construction Company of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau makes a kind of prefabricated bamboo house, which costs more than 16 yuan per square meter, can be moved with the construction site, and can be used for at least five years. Some construction sites in Luoyang use bamboo mat structures for temporary construction projects, which only cost about 10 yuan per square meter. Luoyang is still a place that does not produce bamboo, so in the south where bamboo is abundant, it can certainly be cheaper than Luoyang. In addition to temporary buildings, the standards of other temporary construction projects can also be reduced. For example, temporary roads, except for trunk roads and some main branch roads, other secondary branch roads only need to be temporarily leveled. Temporary processing plants should also determine different construction standards according to different regions, uses, service life, and whether to carry out winter construction, and do not uniformly adopt brick and wood structures and concrete floors and other higher standards.

　　Implementing the above measures will certainly have some difficulties. In the past, the production volume of auxiliary enterprises and the supply of water and electricity were very wide, and there was as much as was used; in the future, these temporary projects will be tightly calculated, and it will definitely feel tight. Therefore, construction enterprises must strive to organize balanced construction and improve equipment utilization in order to meet the needs of construction with relatively few temporary construction projects. Although it is more difficult to do so, it can save a lot of temporary construction project costs and promote construction enterprises to improve their management level.

　　We also see that some projects are constructed in the same area at different times. In this case, the construction unit that is completed first should transfer some of the existing temporary construction projects to the later construction unit as much as possible. If there are no other units continuing construction, the temporary construction projects should also be slightly repaired and transferred to production units or other units for use. These are good ways to utilize temporary construction projects. There are many benefits to doing so: it can save the demolition costs of temporary construction projects and avoid the loss of materials during the demolition process; it can immediately obtain a large number of useful houses without spending money, so that the state can reduce investment in non-productive construction and transfer this part of the funds to productive construction; it can also meet some of the needs of employees in a timely manner without increasing investment. The experience of Harbin Flax Factory vividly proves the benefits of this approach. After the completion of the factory construction, they renovated the temporary dormitories and canteens into dozens of staff family dormitories, canteens, and staff children's schools, saving the country more than one million yuan of funds and solving the difficulties of staff accommodation, meals, and staff children's schooling in a timely manner. This approach is very popular among the masses.

　　The possibility of saving in temporary construction projects should be fully utilized. According to the basic construction investment in 1955, as long as we reduce the proportion of investment in temporary construction projects in the total basic construction investment by 1 percent, we can save tens of millions of yuan, and we can build two or three small and medium-sized machinery manufacturing factories. Therefore, the staff of the basic construction department should actively use their brains, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and strive to make achievements in this regard.

### 严格节约暂设工程的投资

　　严格节约暂设工程的投资
    严格地节约暂设工程的投资是基本建设中节约的一个重要方面。暂设工程包括各种加工厂和修理厂、临时水源地和输水管道、临时变电所和送电线以及运输道路、停车场、仓库、办公室、宿舍、食堂等等。这些工程的建筑量很大，使用不久又要拆除。目前在这方面的浪费是很大的，节约的潜力也是很大的。
    暂设工程中浪费的突出表现是：标准太高，建筑量太多，计划太乱。例如，有些施工单位在确定辅助企业生产能力的时候，总是按照施工的最高需要量来计算；修建办公室、宿舍、食堂的时候，总是根据施工高潮时候的人数作标准，并且还假定工人技术不熟练要增加多少人，突击抢工要增加多少人等等。结果就盲目扩大了加工厂和修理厂，不必要地要求建造木地板的石灰仓库，混凝土地坪的露天停车场，碎石沥青的临时道路等等。很多施工单位的临时办公室、宿舍和食堂，都是砖木结构、水泥地面、玻璃门窗、单层床铺，屋内粉刷得雪白，电灯自来水装置齐全。有的施工部门还盲目地计划在施工现场为流动性很大的建筑工人盖家属宿舍和漂亮的俱乐部。还有一些施工部门不重视施工准备，没有作好施工现场的规划就动工，结果有的把暂设工程盖在要施工的工程地段上，不得不中途拆迁；有的把暂设工程盖在离施工现场很远的地方，增加了运输费用。在工业建设较集中的几个地区，属于不同部门的施工单位之间相互不联系，各搞一套，不能合理地共同建筑和使用某些暂设工程，也造成了很大的浪费。
    暂设工程所以会产生这种浪费现象，是由于有些人不考虑我国的具体情况，脱离了我国现时的劳动生产率而孤立地去改善工人的生活福利条件。这些都是主观主义的想法；这些都有碍于发展社会生产力，有碍于社会主义的积累。
    根据统计，暂设工程投资约占基本建设投资的百分之五左右，这是一项不小的支出。为了降低建筑成本，必须在这方面厉行节约，这是勿庸争辩的。何况顾名思义，暂设工程只是在施工期间临时使用的工程，在新建企业建筑完工以后就要拆除。既然这样，在建设时的标准愈高，建的愈多，那末，浪费也就愈大，这难道不是很明显的吗？因此，各施工部门应该迅速改变过去的作法，用严格的节约精神来使用国家宝贵的资金。根据党中央和国务院厉行节约、克服浪费的指示，今后一切新建的暂设工程都要在保证施工的条件下尽量从简，积极降低建筑标准，减少建筑数量，节约暂设工程的投资；在过去几年已经建筑起来的而现在还可以利用的暂设工程，应该争取继续利用它的全部或大部，尽量发挥投资的经济效果。只要在这两方面注意，就可以为国家节省很多资金。
    节约暂设工程投资的方法是很多的。但需要施工人员开动脑筋去想，需要到工地上去实地研究，不要以为节省不大就不去节省。例如，提前建设和利用永久性工程，就可以不建或少建很多临时工程。充分利用当地现有的房屋、现有的工业企业和城市建设工程，也可以减少暂设工程的数量。如果把施工组织得均衡一些，附属企业就可以建设得小一些，临时宿舍也可以少盖一些。还有一些基本建设工程工作量比较小、技术要求比较低、使用预制构件在经济上不合算的工程，就根本不必要建设附属企业。第一机械工业部在审查所属四个新建工厂的设计概算的时候，仅采取了上述办法中的一项——提前建筑职工宿舍来代替建筑工人临时宿舍和临时建筑物，提前建筑部分厂房和工厂仓库来代替临时仓库和临时加工厂，就可以少建百分之五十的临时宿舍和临时建筑物，少建百分之二十的临时仓库和临时加工厂，合计可以节约二百五十多万元。
    经过精打细算、尽量削减之后，仍然会有一部分暂设工程是必需建设的；这部分暂设工程就应该大大降低建筑标准。国务院规定，一般的临时工程每平方公尺造价，在南方是九元到十二元，在北方是十五元到十七元。现在有些单位的经验证明，暂设工程还可能用比这个标准更低的造价来建设。北京市建筑工程局第一工程公司制作一种装配式的竹房子，每平方公尺十六元多钱，可以随工地转移，最少可以使用五年。洛阳有些工地的暂设工程采用竹席结构，每平方公尺只要十元左右。洛阳还是不产竹子的地方，在盛产竹子的南方，当然可以做到比洛阳的造价更便宜。除了临时建筑物之外，其他暂设工程的标准也可以降低。如临时道路除了干道和一些主要的支道以外，其他次要的支道只要临时平一平就行了。临时加工厂也要分别不同地区、用途、使用年限和是否进行冬季施工等情况，来决定不同的建筑标准，不要一律采用砖木结构和混凝土地坪等较高的标准。
    实行上述这些措施，当然会有一些困难。过去，附属企业的生产量和水电的供应量等都打得很宽，用多少有多少；今后这些临时工程经过精密计算，就一定会感到吃紧。因此，建筑企业必须努力组织均衡施工，提高设备利用率，才能以比较少的暂设工程满足施工的需要。这样做固然困难一些，但是可以节省大量的暂设工程费用，促使建筑企业提高管理水平。
    我们还看到有些工程在同一地区、不同时间施工。遇到这种情况，最初完工的施工单位，应该将某些已有的暂设工程，尽量移交给后一个施工单位使用。如果没有其它单位继续施工，也应该把暂设工程稍加修理，移交给生产单位或其他单位使用。这些都是利用暂设工程的好办法。这样做的好处很多：它可以节省暂设工程的拆迁费，避免拆迁过程中材料的损失；它可以不花钱而马上获得大批有用的房屋，使国家减少非生产性建设的投资，把这部分资金转移到生产性建设中去；它还可以在不增加投资的情况下，及时满足职工的一部分需要。哈尔滨亚麻厂的经验，生动地证明了这种做法的好处。他们在工厂建设完工之后，把临时宿舍和食堂整修成几十幢职工家属宿舍、食堂和职工子弟学校，给国家节约了一百多万元资金，及时解决了职工住宿、膳食和职工子弟就学的困难。这种做法很受群众欢迎。
    在暂设工程中节约的可能性是应该充分利用的。根据一九五五年的基本建设投资计算，我们只要把暂设工程的投资在基本建设总投资中的比重减少百分之一，就可以节省几千万元，可以新建两三座中小型的机械制造工厂。因此，基本建设部门的职工应该积极开动脑筋，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，努力在这方面做出成绩来。
