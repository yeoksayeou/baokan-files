    The meeting of the Department of Chemistry also attracted many listeners. Academician Dubinin, in his closing remarks, spoke of the significance of this conference for the further development of radiochemical research. Referring to the participation of many foreign scientists in the conference, he said that Soviet scientists were happy to introduce their research results in the peaceful use of atomic energy to scientists from other countries and to absorb their experiences.
    In the coming days, the conference participants will learn about the work of several institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and their technical equipment.
    Soviet Agricultural Exhibition Reaches Over One Million Visitors This Year
    Since the opening of the 1955 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, the number of visitors has reached over one million. In addition to visitors from all over the Soviet Union, various delegations from thirty-two countries have visited the exhibition.
    Since the opening of the exhibition, tens of thousands of visitors have come to visit and study in the exhibition halls and exhibition areas every day. The twenty-six exhibition halls of the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Exhibition Hall" are crowded with people all day long, and on some days, as many as one hundred and thirty groups visit each day. The "Russian Federation," "Kazakhstan," "Urals," and "Siberia" exhibition halls have particularly attracted the attention of visitors this year. Hundreds of thousands of people come every day to visit and learn about the achievements and experiences of land reclamation last year. The "Central Exhibition Hall," "Grain Exhibition Hall," and "Land Cultivation Exhibition Hall" are also the most visited places, where people flock to learn the famous Maltsev cultivation method. In addition, various exhibition halls have also held many audience meetings, reports on the introduction of advanced production experiences, and seminars.
    The exhibition is still continuing to receive various new exhibits. The newly harvested grains, vegetables, fruits, and potatoes this year are currently being transported from Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Kuban, and Crimea to Moscow.
    Czechoslovak Miners Launch Competition to Win Chinese Miners' Banner
    Czechoslovak miners continue to deepen the labor competition to win the Chinese Miners' Banner. This banner was presented to Czechoslovak miners by Chinese miners during last year's Miners' Day.
    Recently, in the famous coal region of Czechoslovakia - the Ostrava-Karvina coal district alone - the number of miner groups participating in this competition has increased to two hundred. These groups guarantee to produce 150,000 tons of coal above plan before this year's Miners' Day (September 9). The focus of their competition is to strictly implement the system of one cycle per day according to the indicated chart, maximize the use of machinery and equipment, and adopt advanced working methods.
    German Democratic Republic Expects a Bumper Harvest This Year
    An official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the German Democratic Republic said at a press conference held in Berlin on June 29 that the harvest prospects for grain and oil crops in most areas of the German Democratic Republic are good this year; the output of winter crops is expected to exceed the average year by 15 to 20 percent; and the situation of potatoes and sugar beets is also extremely satisfactory.
    Achievements of Romania's Socialist Industrialization
    The Romanian people are constantly achieving new successes in the process of realizing socialist industrialization.
    At present, the socialist component in Romanian industry has increased to 99 percent. In 1954, the production of heavy industry accounted for 57 percent of the total socialist industrial production, and the number of industrial workers increased to twice that of 1949. Due to the rapid development of the machinery manufacturing industry and the great assistance from the Soviet Union, the total value of metallurgical industrial equipment in Romania has now increased to 7.3 times that of 1948, the total value of oil industrial equipment has increased to 5 times, the total value of coal mining industrial equipment has increased to 4 times, and the total value of electrical equipment industry and power industry equipment has increased to 12.6 times.
    Since the beginning of this year, Romania's socialist industry has achieved new successes. For example, in the first quarter, the total output plan of socialist industry was completed by 106.2 percent. The production capacity of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in the steel industry alone increased by an average of 16.3 percent and 9.9 percent respectively compared with last year.
    Bulgaria's Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting Industry Continues to Develop
    Geological surveys in recent years have proved that Bulgaria has rich non-ferrous metal mineral deposits. In 1954, Bulgaria's copper ore mining volume has increased to 24 times that of 1950. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan, the mining volume of copper ore and lead ore will approximately triple that at the beginning.
    In the past few years, due to the construction of new copper smelters and lead smelters, the production of lead and copper has increased several times. At present, another large lead-zinc factory is under construction, and it is expected that this factory will start production within this year. A copper smelter will also be built by 1958. Due to the continuous development of the non-ferrous metal smelting industry, during the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), the production of lead alone will increase by five and a half times, and other non-ferrous metals and several precious metals will also begin production.
    Albania's Transportation Industry Has Undergone Tremendous Development
    Before liberation, Albania did not have a single railway transportation line. Now, railway transportation has been established between the capital Tirana, the seaport Durres, and the economic center Elbasan, as well as between the Stalin Textile Factory and the Ceric oil refinery, the two largest factories. Last year, railway passenger traffic increased more than tenfold compared to 1948.
    In terms of road transportation, the achievements are particularly remarkable. At present, road freight transportation has increased tenfold compared to the pre-war period, and passenger transportation has increased twentyfold. The mountainous areas of northern Albania, which used to have extremely inconvenient transportation, have established automobile transportation with various central cities in the country.
    Great achievements have also been made in maritime transport. In 1948, Albania established a shipyard that can build steamships with a displacement of up to 500 tons. Coastal navigation is developing increasingly. In 1954, the volume of maritime cargo handling increased ninefold compared to 1938.

    今年苏联农业展览会观众已达百多万
    一九五五年苏联农业展览会开幕以来观众人数已经达一百多万。除了来自苏联全国各地的观众以外，还有三十二个国家的各种代表团参观了展览会。
    从展览会开幕以来，各展览馆、展览地段每天都有几万名观众来参观和学习。“农业机械化和电气化展览馆”的二十六个展览厅整天都挤满了人，有些日子每天参观的团体多达一百三十个。“俄罗斯联邦”、“哈萨克”、“乌拉尔”和“西伯利亚”展览馆今年特别吸引观众的注意。每天都有成千成万的人来参观和学习去年开垦荒地的成就和经验。“中央展览馆”、“谷物展览馆”、“土地耕作展览馆”也是观众最多的地方，人们纷纷到这些展览馆中学习著名的马尔采夫耕作方法。此外，各展览馆还举行了许多观众会见会、和介绍先进生产经验的报告会和座谈会。
    展览会现在还在继续收到各种新的展览品。今年新收获的谷物、蔬菜、水果和马铃薯，目前正从格鲁吉亚、摩尔达维亚、亚美尼亚、库班和克里米亚等地源源运到莫斯科。
    捷矿工为获得中国矿工锦旗展开竞赛
    捷克斯洛伐克矿工们继续深入展开争取获得中国矿工锦旗的劳动竞赛。这面锦旗是中国矿工在去年矿工节时送给捷克斯洛伐克矿工的。
    最近，单在捷克斯洛伐克的著名煤区——俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤区，参加这一竞赛的矿工小组就已经增加到二百个。这些小组保证：在今年矿工节（九月九日）以前要超计划生产十五万吨煤。他们竞赛的着重点是严格执行一昼夜一循环按指示图表生产的制度，最大限度地使用机器和设备，并且采用先进工作方法。
    德意志民主共和国今年可望丰收
    德意志民主共和国农林部的一个官员六月二十九日在柏林举行的一次记者招待会上说：德意志民主共和国大部分地区的谷物和油类作物今年的收成前景良好；冬季作物的产量可望比普通年成超出百分之十五到二十；马铃薯和甜菜的情况也极为令人满意。
    罗马尼亚社会主义工业化的成就
    罗马尼亚人民在实现社会主义工业化的过程中不断取得新成就。
    目前，罗马尼亚工业中的社会主义成分已经增加到百分之九十九。一九五四年重工业的生产已占全部社会主义工业生产的百分之五十七，产业工人的数目增为一九四九年两倍。由于机器制造业的迅速发展和苏联的巨大援助，现在罗马尼亚的冶金工业设备总值增为一九四八年的七点三倍，石油工业设备总值增为五倍，煤矿工业设备总值增为四倍，电气设备工业和电力工业的设备总值增为十二点六倍。
    从今年年初以来，罗马尼亚的社会主义工业获得了新的成就。例如，在第一季度中，社会主义工业的总产量计划完成了百分之一百零六点二。单是钢铁工业中的高炉和平炉的生产能力就分别平均比去年提高了百分之十六点三和九点九。
    保加利亚有色金属冶炼业不断发展
    最近几年的地质勘察工作证明，保加利亚有着丰富的有色金属矿藏。一九五四年保加利亚铜矿的开采量已经增为一九五零年的二十四倍。第二个五年计划结束时，铜矿和铅矿的开采量将约增为开始时三倍。
    在过去几年中，由于新建了炼铜厂和炼铅厂，铅和铜的生产增加了好几倍。目前，另一个大铅锌工厂正在建设中，预计在今年以内这个工厂就可开工生产。到一九五八年还要建成一个炼铜厂。由于有色金属冶炼业的不断发展，在第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）期间，单是铅的生产就将增加为五倍半，其他有色金属和若干贵重金属也将开始生产。
    阿尔巴尼亚运输业有了巨大发展
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚没有一条铁路运输线。现在，在首都地拉那、海港都拉斯和经济中心爱尔巴桑城之间，以及在斯大林纺织工厂和柴立克煤油厂两个最大的工厂之间建立了铁路交通。去年，铁路客运量已增为一九四八年的十倍多。
    在公路运输方面，成绩尤其显著。现在，公路的货运已增为战前的十倍，客运已增为二十倍。以前交通极为不便的阿尔巴尼亚北部各山区，同国内各中心城市已建立了汽车交通。
    海运方面也取得了巨大的成就。一九四八年阿尔巴尼亚建立了一个造船厂，它可以建造排水量达五百吨的汽轮。近海航行日益开展。一九五四年，海运货物运转量已增为一九三八年的九倍。
