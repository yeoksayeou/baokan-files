Lessons from the Serious Losses Incurred by the State-Run "May 3rd" Mechanical Farm
丁田

The state-run "May 3rd" Mechanical Farm is located on the east bank of the Han River in Hubei Province. Construction began in 1953. In two years, it has reclaimed more than 76,000 mu of wasteland, becoming the largest mechanical farm in the southern water-netted area. However, due to the blind and rash management ideas of the farm's leaders, a series of erroneous practices were adopted in the farm's development and production. At the same time, due to waterlogging disasters, serious production reduction losses and waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources were caused in 1954, with a total net loss of more than 624,000 yuan for the entire farm.

In the first year of the establishment of the "May 3rd" Farm, more than 30,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and more than 9,000 mu were sown in spring and summer. This year, because the sown area was not large and the climate was relatively suitable, the crops generally grew well, and production was able to break even without any losses. However, the leaders of this farm did not pay attention to studying the characteristics of the water-netted area and the farm's own conditions to formulate the farm's development plan. They blindly believed that the more wasteland reclaimed, the better, and the larger the farm, the better. Without detailed survey and design, they subjectively determined a plan to reclaim 100,000 mu. In 1954, more than 40,000 mu of wasteland were blindly expanded. Among these reclaimed lands, many were low-lying areas that were perpetually flooded and could not be opened up without coordinated drainage engineering construction, and some were pastures and graveyards essential for the masses to graze livestock. Such reclamation not only caused losses but also aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The farm's reclamation also did not pay attention to the season, not concentrating efforts on summer reclamation for autumn planting or winter reclamation for spring planting, but was busy reclaiming wasteland all year round. The quality of reclamation was low, the progress was slow, and the cost was high. At the same time, it was squeezed together with production, causing losses and waste in several aspects.

In terms of housing construction and machinery and equipment, a large amount of waste was also caused due to poor planning and blindly setting up a large scale. Housing construction was not carried out gradually according to production needs. Many necessary machine and seed warehouses and workers' dormitories were not built. Some workers lived in temporary sheds that did not shelter them from wind and rain, affecting their health and production. The farm headquarters buildings were built blindly and without a plan, and moved three times in two years. Some houses were built at a high cost, but had to be abandoned because the location was not suitable. The waste in road construction projects was also very large. The roads built throughout the farm have now reached 119 kilometers. On the one hand, there are still some places where the operation of machinery is inconvenient, and on the other hand, some newly built roads are completely useless or have very little use. Regardless of the specific conditions for using machines in the water-netted area, the farm blindly purchased a large number of machines, resulting in a backlog of machinery and equipment. Due to losses and waste in various aspects, the farm's basic construction investment has exceeded the average planned investment per mu by 34 percent. However, machine depots, warehouses, and employee dormitories are still insufficient, and essential drainage and irrigation channels and other projects within the farm still need to be built, requiring a certain amount of investment.

The losses and waste caused by blindness and lack of planning in production were also very large. The summer, autumn, and late autumn crops of 1954 were all reduced in production. The yields of wheat and rice were reduced by about 50 percent, while the yields of cotton and peanuts were reduced by more than 80 percent. More than 9,000 mu of turnips were completely unharvested. Although part of the reason for the reduced production was due to disaster-related losses, the main reason was improper work arrangements, and plans that were divorced from reality, and delayed planting. Last year, rice transplanting and the sowing of cotton and soybeans were delayed by more than a month, and late autumn sowing was even later. Some land was flooded very deeply and should have been considered for planting less or not planting at all, but the farm leaders stubbornly insisted on planting, planting cotton and soybeans in very deep water. Some employees were dissatisfied, but they had to follow the "plan"; the masses outside the farm sarcastically said that this was "foreign plows, foreign harrows, foreign householding," and "only planting, no harvesting." In addition, in harvesting and storage work, there were also many losses of grain and cotton due to throwing and scattering.

The blindness in production was even more prominent in the livestock breeding industry. In 1954, the farm raised more than 1,600 heads of cattle, with a mortality rate of 34 percent, while the mortality rate of pigs and sheep reached 60 to 80 percent or more. The direct causes of livestock deaths were lack of livestock sheds, lack of feed, and poor disease prevention and control. However, the fundamental cause was the problem in the leaders' thinking. The farm had just been established, and agricultural production was not yet on track, but it blindly raised thousands of heads of livestock. This approach was obviously wrong.

A chaotic financial management system was also a major cause of waste and losses. The farm's production expenses were unplanned. Last year, working capital was overspent by nearly 100 percent, and non-production expenses and unplanned expenses were also very large. The so-called financial management was only about asking for money and keeping accounts, and there was no supervision or guidance of production at all. Embezzlement and theft also occurred constantly. There was a serious lack of responsibility in materials management. Important machine parts were discarded everywhere, some were dismantled into a mess and no one cared; livestock were lost and no one knew, and pigs died and rotted in the pig herd before they were discovered. The farm's leaders turned a blind eye to this phenomenon. Some workers were dissatisfied with this phenomenon, but their correct opinions were not supported.

The complexity and changeability of the organizational structure and the frequent personnel transfers not only caused confusion in the work, but also caused serious waste of manpower. The organizational office of the farm headquarters changed from office to section and from section to office, and it could not be put in order for a long time. Fixed workers were frequently transferred to do odd jobs, and some farm workers only spent half of their time working in the fields. The production responsibility system was not established, and the chaotic production order could not be overcome for a long time. There were many activists transferred from the countryside and other places in the farm. They had a high enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction and loved the work of the farm. However, due to the many problems in the farm's leadership, their enthusiasm could not be brought into play, and the phenomenon of loss and waste in the farm could not be reversed in time.

The pervasiveness and seriousness of the loss and waste phenomenon in this farm are inseparable from the disunity of the farm's party and government leaders and the weakness of political work. Because ideological struggles were not carried out among the leaders, erroneous practices could not be corrected in time. The relationship between the farm's leaders and the workers and the relationship between the farm and the masses outside the farm were very abnormal. After last autumn, according to the instructions of the provincial party committee, the farm's leading comrades have made a preliminary review of these errors and shortcomings, criticized the blind and rash practices of not conducting survey and design in farm construction and the unplanned production, and reviewed the supply system thinking in management and determined the methods to correct the errors.

The losses and waste of the "May 3rd" Farm are serious, and the lessons are painful. Remembering this lesson is very necessary for running state-owned agricultural enterprises well and reducing losses and waste.

    国营“五三”机械农场造成严重损失的教训
    丁田
    国营“五三”机械农场位于湖北省境的汉水东岸，一九五三年开始建场生产。两年来开垦荒地七万六千多亩，成为南方水网地区最大的一个机械农场。但是，由于农场的领导人员有盲目冒进的经营思想，对农场的发展和生产采取了一系列错误的作法，同时还因为遭受了水涝灾害，以致造成了一九五四年严重的减产损失和人力、物力、财力等各方面的浪费，总计全场净亏损达六十二万四千多元之巨。
    “五三”农场开始建立的第一年，开荒三万多亩，春夏播种面积九千多亩。这年因播种面积不大，气候也较适宜，作物生长一般良好，做到了生产保本，没有什么亏赔。但是这个场的领导人员并没有注意研究水网地区的特点和农场本身的条件，来制定农场的发展计划，盲目地以为开荒越多越好，农场越大越好，不经详细勘测设计即主观确定开荒十万亩的计划。一九五四年，盲目扩大开荒四万多亩。这些开垦地中，有很多是常年积水的不配合排水工程建设根本不能开的洼地，还有一些是群众放牧牲畜不可缺少的牧地和坟地。这样开荒不仅造成了损失，而且引起了群众的不满。农场开荒也不注意季节，不是集中力量伏开秋种，冬开春种，而是一年四季忙于开荒。开荒的质量低，进度慢，成本高，同时和生产挤在一起，造成了几方面的损失浪费。
    在房屋建筑和机具设备等方面，因计划性差和盲目摆大摊子，也造成了很大的浪费。房屋建筑不是根据生产需要逐步进行，很多必要的机器和种籽的仓库以及工人宿舍都没有建筑，有些工人住在临时性的茅棚里，不蔽风雨，影响健康和生产。场部房屋建筑盲目无计划，两年来搬了三个地方。有些房屋花了很多钱建筑好了，但因位置不合适，只好废弃不用。修筑道路工程浪费也很大。现在全场修筑的道路已达一百一十九公里，一方面还有不少地方感到机具运转不方便，另一方面却又有一些新修的道路完全无用或用处很少。农场不顾水网地区运用机器的具体条件，盲目购置了大批机器，造成了不少机器设备的积压。由于各方面的损失浪费，这个场的基本建设投资已超过每亩平均计划投资数的百分之三十四，但是机库、仓库、职工宿舍还不够用，场内必不可少的排水灌溉渠道等工程还需要兴建，都还需要一定数量的投资。
    这个场在生产方面因盲目无计划造成的损失浪费也是很大的。一九五四年夏季秋季和晚秋三季作物，都减了产，小麦、水稻减产百分之五十左右，棉花、花生减产在百分之八十以上，九千多亩萝?全部无收。减产的原因虽有部分是因灾减收，但主要是工作安排不当，计划脱离实际，耕种贻误农时。去年水稻插秧和棉花、大豆播种都延误到一个月以上，晚秋播得更迟。有些地水淹得很深，应该考虑少种或不种，而场部人员却主观地坚持要种，把棉花和黄豆种在很深的水内。职工有些不满，但也只好按“计划”干；场外群众讽刺说这是“洋犁、洋耙、洋做家”，“管种不管收”。另外在收获保管工作中，粮食、棉花的抛撒损失也很多。
    生产上的盲目性在家畜饲养业方面表现得更为突出。一九五四年全场养牛一千六百多头，死亡率达百分之三十四，猪羊的死亡率则达百分之六十至八十以上。家畜死亡的直接原因是没有畜舍，缺乏饲料，疫病防治差。但根本原因则是领导思想上的毛病，场子刚建立不久，农业生产还没上轨道，就盲目饲养成千上万头家畜，这种作法显然是错误的。
    财务管理制度混乱，也是造成浪费损失的一大原因。场的生产费用开支无计划，去年全年流动资金超支近一倍，非生产开支和计划外的开支也很大。所谓财务管理，只是向上要钱记账，根本谈不上什么监督和指导生产。贪污盗窃事件也不断发生。物资管理有严重的无人负责现象，重要机件到处抛弃，有些被拆得稀烂无人过问；牲畜丢失无人知道，猪死了在猪群中发了臭才被发觉。场的领导人员对这种现象熟视无睹，有些工人对这种现象不满，但正确的意见得不到支持。
    组织机构的庞杂多变和人员调动的频繁，不仅造成了工作的混乱，也造成了人力上的严重浪费。场部组织室改科、科改室，很久不能就序，固定工人经常调作杂工，有些农工田间劳作时间只占半数。生产责任制没有建立，生产秩序混乱长期不能克服。农场中有不少从农村和其他地方调来的积极分子，他们参加社会主义建设的热情很高，热爱农场工作，但由于农场领导方面的很多问题不能解决，使他们的积极性不能发挥，使场子的损失浪费现象也不能及时得到扭转。
    这个农场的损失浪费现象的普遍而严重，和农场的党政领导人员的不团结，以及政治工作的薄弱等原因是分不开的。由于领导人员中思想斗争不开展，错误的作法不能得到及时的纠正。农场领导人员和职工群众的关系以及农场和场外群众的关系都很不正常。去年秋后，场的领导同志根据省委指示，已对这些错误和缺点作了初步检查，批判了在农场建设方面不经过勘测设计的盲目冒进和生产方面的无计划等错误作法，检查了经营管理上的供给制思想，确定了改正错误的办法。
    “五三”农场的损失浪费是严重的，教训是沉痛的。记取这个教训对于办好国营农业企业，减少损失浪费，是十分必要的。
