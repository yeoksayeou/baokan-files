Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 28th: The Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, participating in the construction of the motherland's frontier, has achieved new successes in this year's agricultural production and water conservancy construction.

The Agricultural Production and Construction Corps plans to construct a total of nineteen water conservancy projects this year. In the first half of the year, eleven water conservancy projects, including reservoirs and canals, have been under construction in the Manas River, Urumqi River basin, Tarim Basin, Ili, and Hami areas. Currently, seven projects have been basically completed. These projects have already played a role in preventing natural disasters, expanding cultivated land area, and ensuring farmland irrigation. After the completion of the Aksu Victory Canal flood prevention project, it eliminated the threat of mountain floods to the "August 1st" Victory Farm and tens of thousands of mu of farmland belonging to nearby farmers. The Peace Canal main canal, which runs through Urumqi City, has increased its water conveyance capacity after rectification and repair, ensuring water use for more than 200,000 mu of farmland belonging to downstream production troops and farmers of all ethnic groups.

This year, the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps has planted crops such as wheat, cotton, oilseeds, coarse grains, and pasture on 1.12 million mu of land. In order to supply cotton for the inland and Xinjiang textile industry, the area of cotton fields has been expanded by 116 percent compared to last year, and high-yielding, long-fiber Soviet fine cotton seeds have been planted. In order to expand the cultivated land area, the troops have also dispatched a large number of tractors to reclaim wasteland on the edges of the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin. The planned area for wasteland reclamation this year is 610,000 mu.

The Agricultural Production and Construction Corps now has several hundred new-style tractors and combine harvesters of various types, as well as a large number of agricultural machines for plowing, sowing, harrowing, inter-tillage, and threshing. The area of mechanized cultivation has increased by more than 130,000 mu this year compared to last year, accounting for about 40 percent of the cultivated land area, and the efficiency of cultivation has also been greatly improved.

    新疆军区生产部队扩大耕地修建水利工程
    新华社乌鲁木齐二十八日电　参加祖国边疆建设的中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队，在今年的农业生产和水利建设等工作中取得了新的成就。
    农业生产建设部队今年计划修建的水利工程共有十九项。上半年在玛纳斯河、乌鲁木齐河流域，塔里木盆地，伊犁和哈密等地区已有水库、渠道等十一项水利工程在修建。目前有七项工程已基本完工。这些工程对于防止自然灾害，扩大耕地面积和保证农田灌溉已经起了作用。阿克苏胜利渠防御洪水工程修建后，消除了山洪对当地“八一”胜利农场和附近农民的几十万亩耕地的威胁。横贯乌鲁木齐市的和平渠总干渠，经过整顿修理后加大了输水能力，保证了下游生产部队和各族农民二十多万亩农田的用水。
    今年农业生产建设部队在一百十二万亩土地上种植了小麦、棉花、油料、杂粮等农作物和牧草。为了供应内地和新疆纺织工业用棉，今年棉田的面积比去年扩大了百分之一百十六，并且种植了产量高、纤维长的苏联优良棉种。为了扩大耕地面积，部队还派出大批拖拉机在准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地边缘的荒原上开垦荒地。今年计划开垦荒地的面积是六十一万亩。
    农业生产建设部队现在已拥有几百台各型新式拖拉机和谷物联合收割机，以及大批用于犁地、播种、耙地、中耕和脱粒的农业机械。机耕的面积今年比去年增加了十三万多亩，约占耕地面积的百分之四十，耕作效率也有了很大提高。
