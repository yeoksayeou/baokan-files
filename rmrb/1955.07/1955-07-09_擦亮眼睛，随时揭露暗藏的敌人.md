A letter from all officers and soldiers of the Naval Unit 1012: We denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary gang with boundless indignation.

We are the people's armed forces, shouldering the sacred mission of defending the motherland. Therefore, we must not only improve our military skills, master our weapons, and be ready to crush any invading enemy at any time, and wait for the motherland's call to liberate Taiwan, but also strengthen our political study and improve our political vigilance, so that our sense of smell is more sensitive and our eyes are brighter, so that any counter-revolutionary elements have nowhere to hide. We must also resolutely overcome bad tendencies such as complacency, arrogance, and liberalism, so that counter-revolutionary elements have no opportunity to take advantage of and no loopholes to exploit.

A letter from Miao Fenggang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a forging worker at the state-owned Lutai Farm: The Hu Feng incident has given us a great lesson. Since this incident occurred, the employees of our farm have unanimously stated: on the one hand, we must improve our vigilance and crush the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements; on the other hand, we must step up production and build our great motherland. We are currently engaged in wheat harvesting, and everyone has launched a competition to strive to overfulfill the task.

All employees of our farm unanimously demand that Hu Feng and the die-hard elements in the Hu Feng group be severely punished according to law. Only by severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries can we protect our socialist construction.

A letter from all representatives of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference in Jinyuan District, Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province: After we read in the newspaper about the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we all felt extremely angry. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, like the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, is the mortal enemy of our people. We must fight them to the end until this counter-revolutionary group is completely eliminated.

We clearly realize that counter-revolutionary elements are ubiquitous. On the agricultural production front, there are also many counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage activities. In the cooperativization movement in our district, because we had complacency and underestimated the enemy, some counter-revolutionary elements also infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives. They pretend to be honest and falsely active on the surface, but they are actually doing unspeakable things. For example, after Zhang Yuegui, a rich peasant from Huata Township, stole the accounting position of an agricultural production cooperative, he made a mess of the accounts, which affected the production enthusiasm of the members. Another example is Guo Dongzhi, a bad element of the Zhenxi Street Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinyuan District, who used despicable means such as inviting people to drink and eat meat to gain the trust of the cadres and members of the cooperative, stole the position of production team leader in the cooperative, and carried out a series of sabotage activities. He incited a household to withdraw from the cooperative last winter and stole some things from the cooperative. During spring ploughing production this year, he disrupted the cooperative's production plan. When the cooperative sent him out to buy vegetable seeds, he used the method of buying at low prices and selling to the cooperative at high prices, embezzling 58 yuan. Now, although these bad elements have been purged from the cooperative, these facts illustrate the sharpness and complexity of the class struggle during the transition period.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, in addition to requiring the government to resolutely suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all counter-revolutionary elements, we also guarantee to do the following:

One, extensively and deeply publicize the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group to all members of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid group members, and individual farmers in the district, in order to improve the revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of peasants, overcome complacency and underestimation of the enemy, and discover and combat the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements in a timely manner.

Two, further implement the Party's class line in rural areas, adhere to the principle of mutual benefit, strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, and resolutely purge landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements.

Three, mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job in safeguarding the summer harvest, establish various systems for safeguarding the summer harvest, and strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from sabotaging it.

A letter from the General Student Association of Chinese Students in Moscow: We are far away from the motherland in Moscow, and we are always closely watching the struggle of people from all walks of life in the country to expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group with a tense mood. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily", we were extremely angry.

The facts have fully proved that Hu Feng is the fierce enemy of the Chinese people. All Chinese students studying in Moscow unanimously demand that Hu Feng be severely punished, and continue to eliminate all Hu Feng elements and other hidden double-dealing counter-revolutionary elements from all corners, and impose severe legal sanctions on those who are unrepentant. The history of the Soviet Union shows that double-dealing elements such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Rykov, and even Beria have caused great damage to the people's cause. It is precisely because the Soviet people resolutely and ruthlessly suppressed and eliminated these hidden counter-revolutionary elements that the victory of the revolutionary cause was guaranteed. We must learn from the experience of Soviet history and completely eliminate these hidden spies.

The Hu Feng incident once again sounded the alarm for us, and we must always maintain a high degree of political vigilance, because class enemies are always trying to sneak into our "liver". We assure the people of the motherland that we must learn from the Hu Feng incident, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, and not only cultivate ourselves into experts proficient in business, but also cultivate ourselves into communist fighters with a high degree of political vigilance.

A letter from Li Debin, the Chengdu Branch Working Committee of the China Electrical Industry Union: The conspiratorial activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are very infuriating. Hu Feng, a guy who pretends to support the Communist Party but actually opposes the Communist Party, and pretends to support the revolution but actually opposes the revolution, is the most dangerous enemy of our people. The exposure of the Hu Feng group has given us a profound education. We must sharpen our eyes in the future and not let any enemy in disguise take advantage of us.

A letter from all the staff of the Tropical Crops Department of the Ministry of Agriculture: Now the facts are very clear. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is composed of US imperialists, Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, and revolutionary traitors as its backbone. For the past 20 years, they have followed the instructions of their masters, long using the banner of revolution to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Their crimes are profound. We demand that the government eliminate the Hu Feng group and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and give these counter-revolutionary elements the punishment they deserve according to law.

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is another major victory for the Chinese people in their struggle against class enemies under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Party has repeatedly taught us that as long as class enemies at home and abroad exist for one day, we must maintain a high degree of political vigilance, because the more class enemies are dying, the more they will struggle, and the more acute and complex the class struggle will be. However, we still do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of the Party's teachings. Therefore, we have long shown serious political paralysis towards the activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, which shows the serious danger that we only care about business and do not ask about politics. Now we should actively participate in this struggle and learn from this incident, overcome paralysis, improve vigilance, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism in order to continue to wage a resolute struggle against all open and hidden enemies, and ensure the smooth progress of our socialist construction.

A letter from Chen Shuyuan, Gu Zhengquan and other eight teachers from Kunming Institute of Technology: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident has given us a profound lesson. In the past, we did not have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of the struggle to publicize dialectical materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism. We are engaged in political theory teaching, but in the past, we did not participate in these current serious ideological struggles with high enthusiasm. Now we further realize that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and similar enemies are precisely using the weak links on our ideological front to attack us and have long deceived us. Therefore, in the future, we must earnestly strengthen the study of dialectical materialism, better arm our minds, and not allow any counter-revolutionary elements to take advantage of us. At the same time, we must further do a good job in political theory teaching, earnestly cultivate the communist moral character of the younger generation, and enable students to arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism and work harder for the construction of the socialist motherland.

A letter from all teachers, students and staff of the Central Conservatory of Music: In the past, we thought that the Hu Feng issue was a matter for the literary world and had little to do with the music world, so we expressed a lack of concern about it. Since the publication of the third batch of materials, we were shocked to learn that the Hu Feng group has long had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service, and they have infiltrated many of our agencies and groups, and some have even infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party, and some have held quite important positions. This really makes us frightened. We must not be paralyzed anymore, and we cannot think that there are no problems in the music world. We must be vigilant and not let any counter-revolutionary elements hide in our ranks.

This struggle has profoundly educated us. We must constantly improve our revolutionary vigilance, strengthen political sensitivity, and learn the ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements. To this end, we must first strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and thoroughly cleanse our minds of all kinds of bourgeois individualism and liberalism that can be used by the enemy.

　　擦亮眼睛，随时揭露暗藏的敌人
    海军一○一二部队全体指战员来信：我们以无比愤恨的心情声讨胡风这一伙反革命黑帮。
    我们是人民的武装力量，肩负着保卫祖国的神圣任务。因此我们不但要提高军事技术，熟练手中武器，随时准备粉碎敢于来犯的敌人，随时等待祖国的召唤去解放台湾，而且要加强政治学习，提高政治警惕，使我们的嗅觉更灵敏，眼睛更明亮，叫任何反革命分子无处藏身。我们还要坚决地克服麻痹大意，骄傲自满，以及自由主义等不良倾向，使反革命分子无机可乘，无空可钻。
    全国人民代表大会代表、国营芦台农场锻工苗凤刚来信：胡风事件给了我们很大的教训。我场职工，自从这一事件发生后，大家就一致表示：一方面要提高警惕，粉碎反革命分子的阴谋，一方面要加紧生产，建设我们的伟大祖国。我们目前正在进行麦收工作，大家展开了竞赛，争取超额完成任务。
    我们全场职工，一致要求依法严惩胡风和胡风集团中的执迷不悟分子。只有严厉地镇压反革命，才能保卫我们的社会主义建设。
    山西省太原市晋源区互助合作代表会议全体代表来信：我们从报纸上看到胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动后，一致感到万分的愤恨。胡风反革命集团和蒋介石卖国集团一样是我们全国人民的死敌。我们一定要同他们斗争到底，直至彻底肃清这个反革命集团。
    我们明白地认识到，反革命分子是无孔不入的。在农业生产战线上，也有不少反革命分子在进行破坏活动。在我们区的合作化运动中，由于我们有着骄傲自满情绪和轻敌麻痹思想，所以也曾有一些反革命分子混入了农业生产合作社。他们表面上装老实，假积极，而实际上干着不可告人的勾当。如花塔乡富农张月桂窃取了农业生产合作社的会计职务后，把账目搞的一团糟，影响了社员的生产积极性。再如晋源区镇西街先进农业生产合作社的坏分子郭栋只，曾以请喝酒吃肉的卑鄙手段，取得了社的干部和社员的信任，窃取了社里的生产队长的职位，进行了一连串的破坏活动。他在去年冬天煽动
  一户社员退了社，并偷盗了社里的一些东西。今年春耕生产时，他又破坏社里的生产计划。社里派他出外买菜籽时，他以低价收买、高价卖给社里的办法，从中贪污了五十八元。现在，这些坏分子虽已被清洗出社，但这些事实说明了过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化。
    为了保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，我们除要求政府坚决地镇压胡风反革命集团和一切反革命分子外，并保证做到下列几点：
      一，向全区各农业生产合作社社员、互助组员和个体农民广泛深入地宣传胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，借以提高广大农民群众的革命警惕性，克服轻敌麻痹思想，及时发现和打击反革命分子的罪恶活动。
    二，进一步贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线，坚持互利原则，加强贫、中农的团结，坚决清洗地主、富农和反革命分子。
    三，发动和组织群众做好夏收的保卫工作，建立各种保卫夏收的制度，严防反革命分子破坏。
    莫斯科中国留学生学生总会来信：我们在远离祖国的莫斯科，时刻都以紧张的心情密切地注视着国内各界人民揭露胡风反革命集团的斗争。在看过
  “人民日报”所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，我们愤怒极了。
    事实已完全证明，胡风是中国人民的凶狠敌人。我们在莫斯科学习的全体中国留学生，一致要求严惩胡风，从各个角落继续清除一切胡风分子和其他暗藏的两面派反革命分子，对其中怙恶不悛者予以严厉的法纪制裁。苏联的历史表明：托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、李可夫以至贝利亚等两面派分子，曾给人民事业以巨大损害。正由于苏联人民坚决地、无情地镇压了和清除了这些暗藏的反革命分子，革命事业的胜利才得到保证。我们必须从苏联历史上吸取经验，彻底消灭这些暗藏的奸细。
    胡风事件再一次向我们敲响了警钟，必须时刻保持高度的政治警惕，因为阶级敌人时时刻刻都在企图钻进我们的“肝脏”里来。我们向祖国人民保证：一定要从胡风事件吸取教训，加强马克思列宁主义学习，不仅要把自己培养成一个精通业务的专家，而且要把自己培养成具有高度政治警惕性的共产主义战士。
    中国电业工会成都分区工作委员会李德斌来信：胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动，使人感到非常愤怒。胡风这种伪装拥护共产党而实际反对共产党，伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的家伙，是我们人民的最危险的敌人。胡风集团的被揭露，使我们受到了一次深刻的教育，我们今后一定要把眼睛擦亮，不让任何披着伪装的敌人钻空子。
    农业部热带作物司全体人员来信：现在事实已经非常明白了，胡风反革命集团是以美帝国主义、国民党特务分子、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒等为骨干组成的。二十年来他们遵奉着他们主子的指示，长期打着革命的招牌，进行反革命的勾当。他们的罪恶是深重的，我们要求政府肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，并依法给这些反革命分子以应得的惩处。
    胡风反革命集团的被揭发，是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，同阶级敌人进行斗争的又一次重大胜利。党一再教导我们，只要国内外阶级敌人存在一天，我们就必须保持高度的政治警惕，因为越是阶级敌人垂死的时候，他们就越挣扎，阶级斗争就越尖锐越复杂。但我们对党的教导的严重意义仍然认识不足，因此我们长期对胡风反革命集团的活动表现了严重的政治麻痹，这说明了我们只管业务不问政治的严重危险。现在我们应积极参加这次斗争，并从这次事件中吸取经验教训，克服麻痹思想，提高警惕，努力学习马克思列宁主义，以便继续同一切公开的、隐蔽的敌人进行坚决的斗争，保证我们的社会主义建设顺利进行。
    昆明工学院教师陈述元、顾正泉等八人来信：胡风反革命集团事件，给了我们一次深刻的教训。过去，我们对于宣传辩证唯物主义和批判资产阶级唯心主义这一斗争的严重意义是认识不足的。我们从事的是政治理论教学工作，但过去，我们对当前这些严重的思想斗争却没有以高度的热情来参加。现在我们进一步认识到：胡风反革命集团以及类似的敌人，正是利用我们思想战线上的薄弱环节向我们进攻并长期欺骗了我们。因此，今后我们一定要认真加强学习辩证唯物主义，把自己的思想更好地武装起来，让一切反革命分子没有空子可钻。同时，我们要进一步做好政治理论教学工作，认真培养青年一代的共产主义道德品质，使同学们用马克思列宁主义把思想武装起来，更好地为建设社会主义祖国而努力。
    中央音乐学院全体师生员工来信：以前，我们认为胡风问题是文学界的事，同音乐界关系不大，因此对此表示了不很关心的态度。自从第三批材料公布后，我们才大吃一惊，原来胡风集团早就同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切的联系，而且他们混进了我们许多机关、团体，有的还混进了中国共产党，有的还担任了相当重要的职务，这真叫我们怵目惊心。我们决不能再麻痹大意了，不能以为在音乐界没有问题了。我们必须提高警惕，不让任何一个反革命分子藏在我们队伍里。
    这一场斗争，深刻地教育了我们。我们必须时刻地提高革命警惕性，加强政治敏感，学会辨别反革命分子的本领。为此，我们首先必须加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，并且要彻底清洗我们思想上一切足以被敌人利用的各种资产阶级的个人主义、自由主义。
