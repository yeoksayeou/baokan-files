Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 30th. The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 29th, commenting on the current government crisis in Indonesia, saying that the attempt to launch a coup to establish a military dictatorship has now been defeated. The second attempt to carry out a coup by forming an unconstitutional presidential cabinet has also failed, but this does not mean that the real danger has been eliminated. Fascist candidates like the mastermind of the October 17, 1952, incident are still working hard to establish a military dictatorship. The "People's Daily" called on the people to continue to be vigilant.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 30th. Indonesian Vice President Hatta received Asaat, Wilopo, and Sukiman, who were assigned to form a cabinet, on the afternoon of the 29th and held a brief meeting with them.

According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency, after the meeting, Hatta told reporters that the three men are of equal status and that they must decide for themselves who will serve as Prime Minister. They have been given one week to organize the cabinet.

The news said that Asaat (independent) had told Hatta that he did not want to serve as Prime Minister, or even as a cabinet member. He will only contribute his strength as a member of the cabinet formation team.

Wilopo of the Nationalist Party said that the task of organizing a new cabinet should be completed as soon as possible.

Sukiman of the Masyumi Party said that he was bound by the decisions of his party: the new cabinet should not be a coalition cabinet.

Asaat, Wilopo, and Sukiman decided to hold their first meeting on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss the working methods of forming the cabinet.

    印度尼西亚“人民日报”号召人民保持警惕
    新华社雅加达三十日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”二十九日发表社论，评论印度尼西亚目前的政府危机说，想发动政变以建立军事独裁的企图现在已经遭到失败。想通过组成违反宪法的总统内阁而进行政变的第二种企图也已经遭到失败，但是，这并不意味着真正的危险已经消除了。像一九五二年十月十七日事件主谋人那样的法西斯主义者的候选人还在继续努力以建立军事独裁。“人民日报”号召人民继续保持警惕。
    新华社雅加达三十日电　印度尼西亚副总统哈达在二十九日下午接见了受命组阁的阿萨特、韦洛坡和苏基曼，并且同他们举行了简短的会议。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，会后，哈达告诉新闻记者说，这三个人地位平等，谁担任总理要由他们自己来决定。已给予他们一星期的时间来组织内阁。
    消息说，阿萨特（无党无派）曾向哈达表示，他不希望担任总理，甚至于也不希望担任阁员。他将仅仅作为组阁人员来贡献他的力量。
    国民党的韦洛坡说，组织新内阁的任务，应该尽快完成。
    马斯友美党的苏基曼说，他是受到他的党的决定的约束的：新内阁不应当是一个联合内阁。
