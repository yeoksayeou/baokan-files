The Bloody Crimes of Hu Feng Element Zhuang Yong: Setting Up a Private Court and Forcing Peasants to Death
    Ren Huaiyou
    In the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," there is a letter from counter-revolutionary element Zhuang Yong to Hu Feng. Who is Zhuang Yong? The "People's Daily" stated in a note: "[Zhuang Yong] Landlord counter-revolutionary element. When the People's Liberation Army temporarily withdrew from his hometown of Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, in 1946, he privately set up a court to torture peasants, carry out reversals, and force many peasants to death."
    Recently, I visited Houmazhuang in Huwei Township, Pixian County, and learned from the laboring people who had been harmed by Zhuang Yong about Zhuang Yong's counter-revolutionary crimes.
    Zhuang Yong's family was a well-known large landlord family in Pixian County. His uncle, Zhuang Yujiu, was a notorious local tyrant landlord, nicknamed "Second County Magistrate," who had forced many people to death.
    On the nineteenth day of the ninth lunar month in 1946, after the People's Liberation Army withdrew from Pixian County, Zhuang Yong led a group of counter-revolutionary armed forces, holding a pistol, and entered Houmazhuang in Huwei Township, Pixian County. At that time, although the peasants were unarmed, their will was incredibly strong. They had discussed in advance that they would persist in the struggle until the very last minute. The cunning landlord counter-revolutionary Zhuang Yong first used intimidation and deception to deal with the peasants, while maliciously slandering the Communist Party. However, no matter what means he used, apart from reclaiming more than one hundred silver dollars in rent, he got nothing else.
    Zhuang Yong was annoyed. The next morning, he ordered the bandits to arrest poor peasants Yin Shicai, Li Huaixiu, Kou Wenlou, Hu Guangwen, Mao Wenli, Han Shengying, Yin Shirong, Han Yunzhi, Zhao Fengde, Qian Xuesong, and Jiang Xu's family, hanging them from the beams of his house. He used pistols and wooden sticks to torture these kind-hearted peasants, forcing them to admit that they were Communist Party members, staff members of the People's Government, and forcing them to reveal the location of the People's Liberation Army's transfer. The peasants were tortured by these wolves to the point of dying two, three, four times. After being taken down from the beams and doused with cold water, they were hung up again after waking up, becoming a bloody mess. However, they gritted their teeth and did not say a word that the enemy wanted them to say.
    Li Huaixiu, a mother of three children and the village's women's chairman, was tortured the most severely. Zhuang Yong used pistols, shoulder poles, and wooden sticks to torture her repeatedly, forcing her to reveal the direction of the People's Liberation Army's transfer. Li Huaixiu always answered with such impassioned words: "I am a cadre, you can cut me or kill me as you please! I don't know anything else." Li Huaixiu passed out five times from being hung and beaten within three days, and was covered in blood. Her husband, Yin Shicai, was also tortured to death four times at the same time. At that time, Li Huaixiu and Yin Shicai had three boys, the youngest of whom, Rui Lin, was only three months old, and the second child, Rui Xiang, was only three years old. Because they were separated from their parents and no one took care of them, these two children starved to death. At that time, Li Huaixiu's family and relatives tried every means to sell livestock, plows, millstones, beds, pots, and pans, and also borrowed usurious loans, taking out the only remaining food hidden by the family, scraping together eight hundred silver dollars and more than five shih of grain to send to Zhuang Yong, only to temporarily save Li Huaixiu's and their lives.
    As soon as Li Huaixiu and the others escaped from the private court set up by Zhuang Yong, Zhuang Yong came up with even more cruel methods to murder these kind-hearted laboring people. He ordered the bandits to bury alive all ten poor peasant activists who had been tortured, including Li Huaixiu, Yin Shicai, Hu Guangwen, and Kou Wenlou, at the Siyi intersection in front of Houmazhuang. When Li Huaixiu and the others learned of this news, they broke through the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade line and fled to the east of the Grand Canal overnight, separately running to the enemy's rear base areas near Linyi, Shandong, and Hongze Lake in northern Jiangsu. Zhuang Yong did not achieve his goal of killing these laboring people and then cruelly murdered their family members. Zhuang Yong destroyed the houses of Li Huaixiu and Hu Guangwen and killed Han Shengying's donkey. Hu Guangwen's eighty-one-year-old father and seventy-six-year-old mother were forced to death by Zhuang Yong because they were too old to escape, and even their corpses were not allowed to be buried by the villagers. Zhuang Yong also ordered the bandits to hang Mao Wenli, who had worked as a hired laborer in Zhuang Yong's house for many years, from the second beam, constantly torturing him. When the shoulder pole broke, they used a bowl-thick wooden stick to beat him. When the wooden stick broke, they prepared to bury him alive. In the end, Mao Wenli struggled to escape and ran to nearby Liuzhuang, where he vomited blood and died. This is how the landlord counter-revolutionary element Zhuang Yong harmed the peasants.
    These victimized peasants did not return to their hometown until March 1949 (when Pixian County was liberated again). The Party and the People's Government distributed enough land, farm tools, and houses for them to cultivate, and provided relief to help them resettle.
    When these laboring people who had been persecuted by Zhuang Yong saw Zhuang Yong's letter to Hu Feng in the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" published in the People's Daily, they more clearly recognized the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. They said: "So the landlord counter-revolutionary element Zhuang Yong is a member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and has long been in collusion with Hu Feng. This shows that the reactionary landlord class and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are one family. If we want to build socialism, we must eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and demand repayment of this blood debt from them!"

    胡风分子庄湧私设公堂逼死农民的血腥罪行
    任怀友
    在“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”中，有一封反革命分子庄湧给胡风的信。庄湧是什么人？“人民日报”在注文中说：“〔庄湧〕地主反革命分子。当一九四六年解放军一度撤出他的本乡江苏省邳县时，他私设公堂拷打农民，实行倒算，逼死农民多人。”
    最近，我访问了邳县胡圩乡后马庄，从受过庄湧残害的劳动人民的口中，具体地了解了庄湧的反革命罪行。
    庄湧的家庭，是邳县一个有名的大地主家庭。他的叔父庄雨久，是一个有名的恶霸地主，绰号叫“二县长”，曾逼死人命多条。
    一九四六年夏历九月十九日，人民解放军撤出邳县之后，庄湧带领着一队反革命武装，手里抓着一支手枪，走进了邳县胡圩乡后马庄。那时，农民们虽然手无寸铁，但意志却无比坚强，他们事先商量好就是在最后一分钟里也要坚持斗争。狡猾的地主反革命分子庄湧，先用恐吓、欺骗的手段对付农民，同时恶毒地污蔑共产党。可是，不管他施展什么手段，除了倒回租子银元一百多元外，其余什么也没有得到。
    庄湧恼火了。第二天早晨，他就指使匪徒们把贫农尹士才、李怀秀、寇文楼、胡广文、毛文礼、韩胜英、尹士荣、韩运之、赵凤德、钱学松和江徐氏抓去吊在他家的梁头上，用手枪和木棒拷打这些善良的农民，逼迫他们承认是共产党员，是人民政府的工作人员，逼迫他们说出人民解放军转移的地点。农民们被这些恶狼拷打得死过去两次、三次、四次，从梁头上放下来，用冷水浇后，醒过来又吊上去，成为血肉模糊的人了，但是他们咬紧牙关，没有说出一句敌人需要他们说的话。
    有着三个孩子的母亲李怀秀，是村妇女会长，被拷打得最厉害。庄湧用手枪和扁担、木棒，三番五次地拷打她，逼迫她说出人民解放军转移的方向。李怀秀一直就是这样慷慨激昂地回答说：“我是干部，要砍要杀随你们吧！别的什么都不知道。”李怀秀在三天之内，被吊打死过去五次，最后只有一口气了，周身被鲜血染红。她的丈夫尹士才也同时被拷打死过去四次。当时，李怀秀和尹士才夫妻俩有着三个男孩，其中最小的小瑞林只有三个月，第二个孩子瑞祥也只三周岁，这两个孩子，由于离开了父母，无人照顾，活活的饿死了。当时，李怀秀他们的家属和亲友，想尽办法，把牲口、犁耙、磨、床和锅碗瓢盆等都变卖了，还借了高利债，把家庭埋藏的仅有的度命粮食拿出来，凑合了八百银元和五石多粮食送给庄湧，才暂时救回了李怀秀他们的生命。
    李怀秀他们刚逃出庄湧私设的公堂，庄湧又想出更残酷的办法谋杀这些善良的劳动人民。他指使匪徒要把李怀秀、尹士才、胡广文和寇文楼等十名被拷打过的贫农积极分子统统活埋在后马庄前面的四义路口。李怀秀他们知道了这个消息，便突破了国民党匪军的封锁线，连夜逃到运河东，分别跑到山东临沂和苏北洪泽湖边一带敌后根据地。庄湧没有达到杀害这些劳动人民的目的，又惨无人道地谋杀他们的家属。庄湧把李怀秀、胡广文的房屋毁掉了，把韩胜英的驴子杀掉了。胡广文八十一岁的父亲和七十六岁的母亲，由于年纪大没能逃走，被庄湧活活逼死，连尸体都不准庄邻们掩埋。庄湧还指使匪徒们把在庄湧家做过多年雇工的毛文礼吊到二梁上，不断地拷打，扁担打断了，用碗粗的木棒打，木棒打断了，准备活埋，最后毛文礼挣扎着逃了出来，跑到附近刘庄就吐血死去了。地主反革命分子庄湧，就是这样残害农民的。
    这些受害的农民，一直到一九四九年三月（那时邳县已再度解放）才回到家乡。党和人民政府分给他们足够耕种的土地、农具和房屋，并给予救济，使他们重新安家。
    当这些被庄湧逼害过的劳动人民看到人民日报公布“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”里有庄湧给胡风的信时，更清楚地认识了胡风反革命集团的真面目。他们说：“原来地主反革命分子庄湧是胡风反革命集团中的一分子，同胡风早就有勾结，这说明反动的地主阶级和胡风反革命集团是一家子。我们要建设社会主义，一定要肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，并向他们索还这一笔血债！”
