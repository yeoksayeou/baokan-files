Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th. Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the order of President and Prime Minister Ho Chi Minh and on his behalf, sent a note to the Head of State and Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam (South Vietnam) on July 19th. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the Honorable Sirs:

After years of war, the Geneva Accords have brought peace to the countries of Indochina on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

Regarding Vietnam, the Geneva Accords stipulated the cessation of hostilities and the achievement of a political settlement in order to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of Vietnam through free general elections.

Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates that "National elections shall be held in July 1956 under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of the member states of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission specified in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. As of July 20, 1955, the responsible authorities with representation in both regions should consult on this issue."

Article 14(a) of the Vietnam Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities also stipulates that "Pending the holding of national elections to achieve the unification of Vietnam, civil administration in each regrouping zone shall be the responsibility of the party whose forces are to be regrouped in that zone in accordance with this Agreement."

Thus, the principle of achieving Vietnamese unification through free general elections is clearly stipulated in both the Vietnam Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and the date for holding consultative conferences and general elections is determined, and the responsibilities borne by both parties on this issue are specifically stipulated.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and faithfully fulfilled the Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities, withdrawal and transfer of troops, and other matters.

At present, the armies of both sides have been concentrated in the northern and southern regions, thus "creating the necessary prerequisites for achieving a political solution in Vietnam in the near future."

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and believes that the governments concerned should strive to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected, that the unification of Vietnam is achieved, and that peace in Indochina is consolidated. Therefore, on June 6, 1955, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared its readiness to hold consultative conferences with the responsible authorities with representation in the southern region to prepare for general elections and achieve national unification. Subsequently, the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Armistice Commission has raised the issue of preparing for consultations between the responsible authorities with representation in the two regions with the representative of the French Union Forces.

It is extremely important that the responsible authorities with representation in the northern and southern regions hold consultative conferences on schedule, not only in relation to the future of national unification, but also in relation to the faithful implementation of the Geneva Accords and the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the world.

After the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 6, 1955, Saigon Radio announced on July 16, 1955, the "Position of the Government of the State of Vietnam on Achieving National Territorial Unification through General Elections." This statement mentioned general elections and unification, but did not mention an extremely important and extremely realistic issue, namely, the meeting and holding of consultative conferences by the responsible authorities with representation in the two regions as stipulated in the Geneva Agreement to discuss general elections and unification. Furthermore, some of the words in this statement are inconsistent with the facts and do not help to create a favorable atmosphere for convening consultative conferences.

Our compatriots, from north to south, regardless of class, religion, or party affiliation, are eagerly hoping for national unification and expect the consultative conferences to be held as soon as possible and to achieve good results. All countries responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords, as well as all peace-loving countries in the world in general, hope that consultative conferences will be held and that consultations will achieve good results so that the unification of Vietnam can be achieved.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam suggests that you send representatives to meet with our representatives in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreement, starting from July 20, 1955, at a location on Vietnamese territory agreed upon by both parties, in order to discuss the issue of achieving national unification through free general elections throughout the country.

On the order of the President and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and on behalf of the President and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong

### 越南民主共和国政府  关于举行协商会议给越南南方当局的照会

    越南民主共和国政府
    关于举行协商会议给越南南方当局的照会
    新华社河内二十日电　越南民主共和国副总理范文同，根据主席兼总理胡志明的命令并且代表他，在七月十九日送给越南国（南越）国长和总理一件照会，照会全文如下：
    两位先生：
    经过了多少年的战争，日内瓦协定已经在尊重越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上，为印度支那各国带来了和平。
    关于越南，日内瓦协定规定了停止敌对行动，取得政治解决，以便巩固和平，通过自由普选实现越南的统一。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条很清楚地规定：“将在一九五六年七月内，在停止敌对行动协定中所规定的国际监督和监察委员会成员国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行全国选举。自一九五五年七月二十日起，双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应就此项问题进行协商”。
    越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条甲款也规定：“在举行获致越南统一的全国选举以前，各集结区内的民政由依照本协定应在该区集结部队的一方负责”。
    这样，在越南停止敌对行动协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言中都明确规定了通过自由普选实现越南统一的原则，确定了举行协商会议和举行普选的日期，并且具体规定了双方对这个问题所负担的责任。
    在停火、撤退和转移军队以及其他各项问题上，越南民主共和国政府一贯忠实地履行了日内瓦协定。
    目前，双方军队已集结在南北两地区，因而已“造成在最近时期内实现越南政治解决的必要前提”。
    越南民主共和国政府将继续彻底履行日内瓦协定，并认为各有关政府应努力保证使日内瓦协定得到尊重，越南的统一得以实现，印度支那的和平得以巩固。因此，一九五五年六月六日，越南民主共和国政府声明准备同南方地区有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，以准备普选，实现国家的统一。其后，中央联合停战委员会越南人民军代表团已经向法兰西联邦部队代表提出了准备两地区有代表性的负责当局之间的会商问题。
    北方和南方地区有代表性的负责当局按期举行协商会议是极其重要的，不仅同国家统一的前途有关，而且同日内瓦协定的忠实履行有关，同印度支那和世界和平的巩固有关。
    在越南民主共和国政府一九五五年六月六日发表了声明以后，一九五五年七月十六日，西贡电台公布了“越南国政府对通过普选实现国家领土统一的立场”。这个声明曾提到普选和统一，但是没有提到一个极其重要、极其现实的问题，即日内瓦协议所规定的两个地区有代表性的负责当局会见并且举行协商会议讨论普选和统一的问题。此外，在这个声明中，有些话是不符合事实的，而且无助于创造召开协商会议的有利气氛。
    我国同胞，从南到北，不论阶级、宗教和党派，都切望国家统一，期待协商会议早日举行并且获得良好的结果。负有保证日内瓦协定实施的责任的各国以及总的说来全世界爱好和平的各国，都希望举行协商会议，而且希望协商能获得良好结果，越南的统一得以实现。
    越南民主共和国政府建议你们派出代表同我们的代表按照日内瓦协议的规定，从一九五五年七月二十日起，在越南领土上一个双方协议的地点举行协商会议，以便讨论通过在全国举行自由普选实现国家统一的问题。
    奉越南民主共和国主席兼总理的命令并且代表越南民主共和国主席兼总理
                            副总理范文同
