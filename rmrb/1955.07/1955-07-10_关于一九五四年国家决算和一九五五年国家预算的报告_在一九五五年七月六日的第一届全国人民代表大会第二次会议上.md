Comrades,
I am presenting the report on the 1954 national budget settlement and the 1955 national budget on behalf of the State Council to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.

I. The 1954 National Budget Settlement

The 1954 national budget was realized under the condition of the gradual upsurge of our national economy. The execution of the budget has, in turn, promoted the development of the national economy.

The total revenue of the 1954 national budget settlement was 307.4583 billion yuan (new currency, same below). Of this, the current year's revenue was 262.3683 billion yuan, and the carryover from the previous year (including accumulated surpluses from previous years) was 45.09 billion yuan. The current year's revenue completed 113.15% of the budget. Of the total revenue, various taxes amounted to 132.1808 billion yuan, completing 99.74% of the budget and accounting for 50.38% of the current year's total revenue. Of this, industrial and commercial taxes amounted to 89.7154 billion yuan, completing 94.44% of the budget. Agricultural taxes amounted to 32.7751 billion yuan, completing 116.74% of the budget. The revenue from state-owned enterprises was 99.615 billion yuan, completing 119.53% of the budget and accounting for 37.97% of the current year's total revenue. Credit, insurance, and other revenues amounted to 30.5725 billion yuan, completing 190.98% of the budget and accounting for 11.65% of the current year's total revenue.

In the sources of revenue for the 1954 national budget settlement, excluding foreign loans, the contributions from state-owned enterprises to the state (including both enterprise income and taxes) accounted for 65.24% of the total contributions from various social and economic components to the state. This indicates the important position that state-owned enterprises hold in the accumulation of funds for socialist construction in our country.

The 1954 industrial and commercial tax revenue did not meet the plan. This was partly due to the impact of floods on light industry and commerce, and partly because the change in the ratio of public to private economies exceeded the anticipated speed, with part of the tax revenue being paid to the state in the form of profits. The 1954 agricultural tax revenue exceeded the budget because the actual settlement price of public grain transferred from the financial department to the grain department was higher than the estimated price in the budget. Additionally, the grain department's supplementary payment for past years' public grain prices was also included in the current year's agricultural tax settlement. Therefore, the budget was exceeded.

The 1954 credit and insurance revenue significantly exceeded the original plan. Excluding the surplus of 2.3613 billion yuan from public bonds, the main reason was the increase in loans from the Soviet government. This is another generous aid from the Soviet government to our construction.

The total expenditure for the 1954 national budget settlement was 246.3244 billion yuan, completing 98.74% of the budget.

The expenditure on economic construction in 1954 was 123.5822 billion yuan, which is 109.15% of the budget and accounts for 50.17% of the current year's total expenditure, making it the largest item of expenditure.

In 1954, the total investment in basic construction (including economic, educational, and administrative aspects) increased by 15% compared to 1953. Of this, the five industrial ministries under the central government completed 33 major projects. Large-scale construction projects such as the thin plate factory and the No. 6 blast furnace of Anshan Steel, the Shenyang Wind Power Tool Factory, and the Chongqing Power Plant have begun production. The production capacity and fixed assets of industries such as iron smelting, steel smelting, coal mining, power generation, and machinery have significantly increased.

Although some regions suffered severe floods in 1954, the total industrial and agricultural output value for the year still increased by 9.4% compared to 1953. The total industrial output value increased by 17%; of this, state-owned industry increased by 27%. Compared to 1953, the proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 30% to 33%. In the total industrial output value, the proportion of state-owned industry increased from 54% to 59%, cooperative industry increased from 3.4% to 3.8%, joint-venture industry increased from 5.7% to 12.3%, and private industry decreased from 36.8% to 24.9%. Simultaneously, the proportion of production of means of production increased from 41.2% to 42.3%, and the proportion of production of means of consumption decreased from 58.8% to 57.7%. This indicates that our country is steadily advancing along the path of socialist industrialization.

In 1954, the total allocation for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology was 13.7508 billion yuan, including 2.4384 billion yuan for flood control, emergency repairs, dike reinforcement, and dike restoration. The allocation for agriculture played an important role in improving national agricultural production, promoting the use of improved agricultural tools and pesticides, preventing agricultural pests and diseases, utilizing water and soil, and developing animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Additionally, the 3.7394 billion yuan in national expenditure for rural relief, mainly for disaster relief, the highest amount of agricultural loans reaching 9.3278 billion yuan, and the national purchase of industrial raw materials, local products, special products, and by-products from farmers totaling over 60 billion yuan, all benefited the farmers. In 1954, local governments across the country helped farmers to build and repair numerous canals, ponds, dikes, and dams, and provided over 110,000 water wheels, expanding the irrigated area by 11.7 million mu and improving the irrigation of 36.9 million mu. In forestry, 17.4 million mu of afforestation was completed, and 580,000 mu of afforestation was carried out after logging. In water conservancy construction, a total of 650 million cubic meters of earthwork, 8.79 million cubic meters of stonework, and 1.9 million cubic meters of concrete were completed. The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, the Boshan Reservoir on the Huai River, and the diversion project for the main and tributary rivers of Wuxian County were all completed. The Foziling Reservoir on the Huai River was basically completed. These water conservancy projects yielded significant benefits in the fight against floods in 1954. Although national agricultural production did not meet the original plan due to natural disasters, and cotton production decreased compared to the previous year, the total output value of agriculture and its by-products, as well as the grain output, still increased compared to 1953. By the end of 1954, there were 97 state-owned mechanized farms covering 2.78 million mu of land; 89 agricultural machinery stations served 6.58 million mu of land. By the end of 1954, there were nearly 500,000 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, accounting for approximately 11% of the total number of rural households, and the cultivated land operated by these cooperatives accounted for 14% of the national cultivated land area.

The production and cooperative transformation of handicrafts also developed in 1954. The output value of individual handicrafts increased by 11%, and the output value of handicraft production cooperatives increased by 76%. The number of people organized into handicraft production cooperatives and production groups reached 1.21 million, an increase of 2.5 times compared to 1953.

In transportation, the total volume of railway freight completed 103% of the plan, an increase of 20% compared to 1953; the total volume of motor vehicle freight completed 117% of the plan, an increase of 43% compared to 1953. In 1954, 17 new railways began or continued construction, of which 12 were laid with tracks totaling 831 kilometers. The Jincheng–Erenhot line connecting China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia was completed, the Lanxin line reached west of Wuyi, and the Baocheng line reached near Shaanxi Province. Twenty major highways were newly built or reconstructed, totaling 5,828 kilometers. The difficult construction of the Kangding–Lhasa Highway and the Qinghai–Tibet Highway was completed. Other maritime, inland waterway, civil aviation, and postal services also developed compared to 1953.

In 1954, the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide reached 391.9 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 12% compared to 1953. The proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce in the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide increased from 41% in 1953 to 58%. At the same time, a large number of private merchants established agency, consignment, or procurement relationships with state-owned and cooperative commerce. The import and export trade in 1954 both exceeded the plan, with the total trade volume increasing by 4.5% compared to 1953. Imports and exports were roughly balanced.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of labor productivity, the living standards of the people have been further improved. In 1954, the number of employees in state-owned, cooperative, and joint-venture industrial enterprises increased by approximately 500,000, and the total wage bill increased by 19%. The working conditions and welfare facilities of employees have also improved. The number of employees nationwide covered by labor insurance reached over 5.38 million, an increase of 11% compared to the previous year. The direct labor insurance fees, medical fees, educational fees, and welfare fees paid by the central government's five industrial ministries for employees in 1954 averaged 16.4% of the total wage bill. The national construction of residential buildings completed 13 million square meters; if each household is allocated 24 square meters, the newly built housing can solve the accommodation problem for 540,000 households of employees. By the end of 1954, the savings of urban and rural residents increased by 26% compared to the same period last year.

In 1954, the expenditure on social and cultural education was 34.6051 billion yuan, which is 94.31% of the budget and accounts for 14.05% of the current year's total expenditure. In 1954, the number of students in institutions of higher learning reached 258,000, an increase of 42,000 compared to 1953; the number of students in secondary schools reached 4,246,600, an increase of 617,000 compared to 1953; the number of students in primary schools reached 51,119,000, slightly less than in 1953 due to the impact of floods. The number of medical beds nationwide managed by the Ministry of Health reached 178,000, an increase of 22,000 compared to 1953. Other aspects such as culture, science, books, and publishing also saw new developments. The expenditure on welfare and social relief was 6.176 billion yuan, of which 1.9802 billion yuan was for welfare and 4.1958 billion yuan was for social relief. As mentioned earlier, the majority of social relief funds were used in rural areas, especially in disaster-stricken areas.

The 1954 national budget also took into account the needs of minority areas. The 1954 national budget settlement allocated approximately 1.27 billion yuan for transportation and communication investments in minority regions, approximately 960 million yuan for education, and approximately 310 million yuan for health. These allocations and related work in various aspects helped improve the economic and cultural conditions of minority regions.

The national defense expenditure in 1954 was 58.1353 billion yuan, which is 110.38% of the budget and accounts for 23.6% of the current year's total expenditure; the administrative management expenditure was 21.6207 billion yuan, which is 90.56% of the budget and accounts for 8.78% of the current year's total expenditure; the expenditure on credit, insurance, and other items was 8.3811 billion yuan, which is 109.77% of the budget and accounts for 3.4% of the current year's total expenditure.

The 1954 national budget ensured the funds needed for national construction. However, the budget allocations for basic construction and some other expenditure items were not fully used. This was not only due to savings, the use of past accumulated materials, and certain technical reasons but also, more importantly, due to the "broadly planned, narrowly used" mindset in some departments, which did not strictly verify and calculate the budget, leading to overestimation. This situation not only created conditions for waste but also directly tied up national funds, hindering the development of the national economy. This flaw must be rectified in the future.

In the 1954 national budget settlement, the current year's revenue exceeded the current year's expenditure by 16.0439 billion yuan. Adding the surplus from 1953 and previous years of 45.09 billion yuan, the current year's surplus totaled 61.1339 billion yuan. On the surface, this appears to be a significant amount, but it generally cannot be considered actual revenue for the national budget because this money has already been invested in the national bank's credit process through bank deposits. Our national finance and the national bank's credit work are mutually supportive. The balance of the national budget and the balance of the national bank's credit plan are inseparable. Therefore, the accumulated surpluses from previous years have been gradually used as credit funds for the national bank, lent to the industrial, agricultural, commercial, grain, and cooperative sectors as working capital. For these state-owned enterprises that lacked funds but rapidly developed in a few years, such support is necessary and correct. Thus, the accumulated surpluses from previous years should not be used for fiscal expenditures. If these funds are forcibly withdrawn from the national bank and state-owned enterprise departments, it will disrupt the balance of the national bank's credit plan and cause the operations of related state-owned enterprises to fall into chaos. In the past few years, due to our failure to align the balance of the national budget with the balance of the bank's credit plan when compiling the national budget, the accumulated surpluses from previous years were rolled over year by year through the budget, resulting in a large surplus in the 1954 national budget settlement that, while appearing significant, could not be fully utilized. To correctly reflect this situation in the national budget, the Ministry of Finance, based on the instructions of the State Council, has handled the aforementioned 61.1339 billion yuan of accumulated surpluses from previous years as follows: transferring the revolving fund of 3.0742 billion yuan already used for local budget turnover; repaying the overdrafts from the revolutionary war period and the early days of the People's Republic of China to the national bank totaling 21.5883 billion yuan; depositing 5.044 billion yuan in a special account in the national bank; and transferring the remaining 31.4274 billion yuan to the 1955 national budget as last year's surplus revenue for appropriate handling in the 1955 national budget. The aforementioned two items of repayment of past fiscal overdrafts and deposit in the national bank have actually already been used as credit funds by the national bank. As mentioned earlier, in the past few years, a significant portion of the working capital for state-owned enterprises has been solved through the national bank in the form of loans, and the accumulated surplus deposits from previous years of the national budget have been the main source of funds for the national bank to issue such loans. Therefore, the handling of the accumulated surpluses from previous years in the 1954 national budget is entirely in line with the actual situation.

II. The 1955 National Budget

1955 is the third year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Completing this year's national economic plan is of great significance for the completion of the entire Five-Year Plan. According to the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party's Eighth Central Committee on the draft of the first Five-Year Plan, the 1955 national budget must adhere to the policy of increasing production and practicing economy to accumulate funds, ensuring the needs of national economic construction, primarily heavy industry construction, and maintaining a certain amount of fiscal reserve power.

The 1955 national budget, based on the development of the national economy in the previous year and the execution of the national budget, in accordance with the requirements of the national economic development plan for this year, sets the total revenue at 311.9252 billion yuan. Of this, the current year's revenue is 280.4978 billion yuan, and the carryover from the previous year's surplus is 31.4274 billion yuan; the total expenditure is 297.3672 billion yuan, including an additional 16.8694 billion yuan from the previous year's surplus to replenish the working capital of state-owned enterprise departments; the current year's total revenue exceeds the current year's expenditure by 14.558 billion yuan, becoming the current year's surplus.

Compared to the 1954 national budget settlement, the 1955 national budget's current year's revenue increased by 6.91% (excluding Soviet loans and other non-comparable factors, the actual increase is 6.55%); the current year's expenditure increased by 20.72%. The increase in expenditure is due to the gradual increase in fiscal expenditures to adapt to the development of the national economy and the need to carry over the unused budget allocations for basic construction and some other expenditure items from 1954 to 1955 for continued use. More importantly, the 1955 national budget allocated 16.8694 billion yuan from the previous year's surplus to replenish the working capital of state-owned enterprise departments to repay part of their debts to the national bank. Additionally, due to the increase in defense expenditures after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lüshunkou, and the increase in bond redemption and repayment of principal and interest on Soviet loans by 4.153 billion yuan compared to 1954, these factors have led to a relatively large increase in the total expenditure of the 1955 budget compared to 1954.

In the 1955 national budget, the current year's revenue from various taxes is 137.8057 billion yuan, accounting for 49.13% of the current year's budget revenue and increasing by 4.26% compared to 1954. Of this, industrial and commercial taxes amount to 100 billion yuan, accounting for 35.65% of the current year's budget revenue and increasing by 11.46% compared to last year. Excluding non-comparable factors, the actual increase is 8.95%; agricultural tax revenue is 28 billion yuan, accounting for 9.98% of the current year's budget revenue, with the amount of public grain collected remaining at the 1952 level.

Next, the revenue from state-owned enterprises is 111.1581 billion yuan, accounting for 39.63% of the current year's budget revenue and increasing by 11.59% compared to 1954. The revenue from state-owned enterprises has increased so significantly not only because of the growth in production and the expansion of commodity circulation but also because of the continuous improvement in labor productivity and cost reduction by state-owned enterprises. The 1955 plan stipulates that the labor productivity of state-owned and joint-venture industries will increase by 7% compared to the previous year, and the production cost of state-owned and joint-venture industries will decrease by an average of 6%. The cost of state-owned and joint-venture transportation will decrease by an average of 2.7%, and the circulation cost of state-owned commerce will decrease by an average of 12.9%.

Credit, insurance, and other revenues total 31.534 billion yuan, accounting for 11.24% of the current year's budget revenue and increasing by 3.14% compared to 1954. Of this, credit and insurance revenues have increased; while special and temporary other revenues have decreased due to the annual regularization of fiscal operations compared to 1954. The increase in credit revenue is mainly due to the Soviet government's withdrawal of Soviet troops from the joint Soviet-Chinese naval base in Lüshunkou by the end of May 1955, during which the Soviet government, in addition to transferring equipment to the Chinese government without charge, also transferred many military materials in the form of loans. The Soviet government's massive aid to our country demonstrates the ever-growing great friendship between the Soviet Union and China. I hereby express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government on behalf of the Chinese government.

The aforementioned sources of national budget revenue, excluding foreign loans, show the following changes compared to 1954 when viewed from the proportion of contributions from various social and economic components: the proportion from state-owned economy (including both enterprise income and taxes) increased from 65.24% to 69.47%; the proportion from cooperative economy increased from 3.65% to 4.77%; the proportion from joint-venture economy increased from 1.66% to 1.98%; the proportion from farmers (including agricultural production cooperatives) decreased from 14.23% to 11.76%; the proportion from private industry and commerce decreased from 13.34% to 10.7%; and the proportion from other social and economic components decreased from 1.88% to 1.32%. The reason for these changes is that the socialist economy will grow further; part of the private enterprises will continue to transform into joint-venture enterprises; and the state will continue to implement a stable burden policy for farmers.

It should be noted that due to natural disasters in several provinces in 1954, which affected the autumn harvest of that year and a significant portion of light industry production in 1955, the current year's revenue in the 1955 national budget increased by only 6.91% compared to 1954, while the current year's revenue in the 1954 national budget settlement increased by 20.56% compared to 1953. Therefore, achieving this budget revenue plan should not be very difficult. The results of the 1954 budget execution indicate that there is still significant potential in enterprises with socialist and semi-socialist characteristics. Efforts to tap this potential can not only ensure the completion of the 1955 economic and fiscal plans but also strive for their over-fulfillment.

The primary task of the 1955 national budget expenditure is to ensure the development of heavy industry according to the national economic development plan and to correspondingly develop light industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings.

The 1955 national budget allocates 141.8876 billion yuan for economic construction, an increase of 14.81% compared to 1954 and accounting for 47.72% of the current year's total expenditure. Of the economic construction expenditure, industrial expenditure is 63.88 billion yuan, accounting for 45.02% of the total economic construction expenditure and increasing by 11.32% compared to last year. Of this, the allocations for heavy industries such as electricity, coal, crude oil, metallurgy, chemicals, and machinery manufacturing are 56.9807 billion yuan, accounting for 89.2% of the total industrial expenditure; the allocations for light industries such as textiles, papermaking, sugar, and salt are 6.8993 billion yuan, accounting for 10.8% of the total industrial expenditure. The allocations for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology are 13.1221 billion yuan, accounting for 9.25% of the total economic construction expenditure and decreasing by 4.57% compared to last year. The allocations for transportation are 21.4573 billion yuan, accounting for 15.12% of the total economic construction expenditure and increasing by 21.89% compared to last year. The allocations for commerce, grain, foreign trade, and other sectors are 28.4463 billion yuan, accounting for 20.05% of the total economic construction expenditure and increasing by 61.51% compared to last year. Additionally, the allocations for reserve materials, municipal construction, joint-venture enterprise investments, and other economic construction expenditures total 14.9819 billion yuan, accounting for 10.56% of the total economic construction expenditure.

The scale of basic construction in 1955 is enormous. The portion of the total national budget expenditure used for basic construction (including economic, educational, and administrative aspects) will be 95.9164 billion yuan, accounting for 32.26% of the current year's budget expenditure and increasing by 10.43% compared to last year. The key construction units specified in the Five-Year Plan will begin or continue construction this year. There are a total of 1,079 construction units above the limit this year, of which 287 are newly started this year and 792 are continuing construction. Of the 156 important projects designed by the Soviet Union for our country, 37 will begin construction this year and 54 will continue construction. The results of construction in 1955 will see the completion of construction or important engineering projects for 67 major construction units in the central government's five industrial ministries, including the No. 5 blast furnace of Anshan Steel, the No. 11 and No. 12 coking ovens of Anshan Steel, the Jilin Electrode Factory, the Fushun Power Plant, the Taiyuan Thermal Power Station, the Harbin Quantities and Tools Factory, the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, the Beijing Second Cotton Textile Mill, the Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Mill, and the Guangzhou Paper Mill. Some new industrial cities will begin construction in our inland areas. The construction cost of basic construction specified in the plan will be approximately 10% lower than last year.

The total industrial output value nationwide in 1955 will increase by 7.7% compared to last year. Of this, state-owned industry will increase by 11.2%, cooperative industry will increase by 21.3%, joint-venture industry will increase by 33.9%, and the comparable part of private industry will increase by 2.2%. Excluding cotton textiles and cigarettes, which had reduced raw materials and could not increase production due to the impact of floods last year, and some machinery industries that could not increase production during the transformation of new products, the output of most other products will increase compared to last year. The production increase situation for enterprises under the central government's various industrial ministries is as follows: electricity generation will increase by 19.3%, coal will increase by 14.7%, crude oil will increase by 31.6%, pig iron will increase by 13.8%, steel will increase by 18.3%, cement will increase by 21.7%, machine-made paper will increase by 8.9%, sugar will increase by 17.8%, and salt will increase by 50.1%.

The total output value of agriculture and its by-products in 1955 will increase by 6.4% compared to 1954. The rate of increase is relatively high because the base number of various crop yields in 1954 was relatively low. The plan stipulates that the grain output this year will increase by 5.3% compared to last year; cotton will increase by 20.6%, flue-cured tobacco will increase by 38%, and sugarcane will increase by 16%. The number of state-owned mechanized farms will increase to 117, covering 4.334 million mu of land; tractor stations will expand to 106, serving 12.05 million mu of land. Under the condition of increased grain production, livestock breeding is also required to increase. The plan stipulates that 10 million mu of land will be reclaimed, 18 million mu of afforestation will be carried out, and 600,600 mu of afforestation will be carried out after logging. In water conservancy, based on the winter dike repair and restoration project in 1954, the dikes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Huai River, the Liao River, the Zhujiang River, and the rivers in North China will be further improved, the dikes of Dongting Lake will be restored, temporary flood control measures will be strengthened in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River will be carried out, and the construction of the Nanwan Reservoir in Henan, the Foziling Reservoir in Anhui, the Meishan Reservoir, the Dapu Reservoir in Liaoning, and the Huayang River flood control and reclamation project in Anhui will be continued. Simultaneously, agricultural water conservancy will be vigorously developed, and the irrigated area will be expanded by 14 million mu.

In response to the needs of industrial and national defense construction, transportation will also develop accordingly. The 1955 railway allocation is 14.3364 billion yuan, an increase of 25.94% compared to last year. New railways will lay 1,061.9 kilometers of tracks, of which the Lanxin Railway will reach Zhangye, and the Baocheng Railway will complete most of its work this year. The railways from Guilin in Guangxi to Zhanjiang in Guangdong and from Beijing Fengtai to Shacheng in Hebei will be completed in the first half of this year. The total volume of railway freight will increase by 9.4%, and the total volume of passenger transport will increase by 2.7%. In 1955, 1,342.8 kilometers of highways will be built, and the total volume of motor vehicle freight will increase by 27.6% compared to last year. The total volume of maritime freight will increase by 22.3% compared to last year, of which state-owned maritime transport will increase by 19.6%.

The total retail sales of social commodities nationwide in 1955 are expected to reach 426 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 10.4% compared to last year. Of this, state-owned and cooperative commerce will account for 51.7%, and private commerce (including consignment, agency, and joint-venture parts) will account for 48.3%. Compared to 1954, the former will slightly decrease, and the latter will slightly increase, which is due to the overly rapid progress of the former in 1954. The retail plans for major commodities in public and private commerce have all increased to varying degrees compared to last year. Of this, cotton cloth will increase by 6.8%, vegetable oil will increase by 20%, coal will increase by 10.8%, sugar will increase by 6.7%, kerosene will increase by 1.1%, machine-made paper will increase by 10.4%, knitted products will increase by 8.5%, and rubber shoes will increase by 11.7%.

The realization of the 1955 national economic plan will result in a 7% increase in the total industrial and agricultural output value compared to last year. The proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase to 33.7%, and in the total industrial output value, the value of means of production will increase to 45.1%. The proportion of various industries in the total industrial output value will be: state-owned will increase to 59.3%, cooperative will increase to 4.3%, joint-venture will increase to 15.4%, and private will decrease to 21%. At the same time, many private industrial and commercial enterprises will transition to the state's planned track through processing, ordering, purchasing, selling, and other forms of state capitalism. The number of handicraft production cooperatives will develop to 22,800. Agricultural production cooperatives, which have already developed to approximately 670,000 by the spring of this year, will be further consolidated and actively developed under the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit.

With the development of the economy and the improvement of labor productivity, the living standards of the people will be further improved. This year, the average wage (including promotions) of employees in various departments of the national economy will increase by 3.3%. After the completion of 11 million square meters of housing built by the central government and its affiliated enterprises for employees in 1955, the living conditions of a large number of employees will be further improved.

Under the condition of continued price stability and currency consolidation, new currency was issued in March of this year. New currency at 1 yuan is equivalent to 10,000 yuan of old currency, eliminating the remnants of historical inflation. The issuance of new currency has greatly facilitated the calculation and use of currency, and during the issuance process, it did not cause any loss to the people nor did it affect prices. This is a significant indicator of the soundness of our country's economic situation.

The 1955 national budget allocates 38.5069 billion yuan for social and cultural education expenditures, accounting for 12.95% of the current year's total expenditure and increasing by 11.28% compared to last year.

In the social and cultural education expenditure, the expenditure for education and health is 31.8633 billion yuan. In 1955, 91,100 new students will be enrolled in institutions of higher learning nationwide, and the number of students in school will reach 290,000, an increase of 12.4% compared to last year; 1,670,000 new students will be enrolled in secondary schools, and the number of students in school will reach 4,576,600, an increase of 7.77% compared to last year; 15,860,000 new students will be enrolled in primary schools, and the number of students in school will reach 55,020,000, an increase of 7.5% compared to last year. In 1955, the number of medical beds nationwide managed by the Ministry of Health will reach 199,000, an increase of approximately 11.6% compared to last year. In 1955, the number of scientific research personnel will increase by 36.3%. In the cultural sector, 169 films will be produced and dubbed in 1955, and 990,200,000 books will be published.

In the social and cultural education expenditure, the expenditure for welfare and social relief is 6.0116 billion yuan, of which 2.4517 billion yuan is for welfare and 3.5599 billion yuan is for social relief. Of the social relief funds, 2.7165 billion yuan is used for rural relief. Other expenditures in the social and cultural education expenditure are 632 million yuan.

Our country adheres to a peaceful policy. The people of our country are all engaged in the peaceful labor of building a great motherland. In the 1955 national budget, the expenditure for economic construction and social and cultural education accounts for 60.67% of the current year's total expenditure, fully reflecting the desire of the people of our country for peaceful construction. However, imperialists are still surrounding us, occupying our territory of Taiwan, and threatening us with a new world war. To defend the independence of our motherland, defend the sacred sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, defend national construction, and liberate our territory of Taiwan, it is necessary to continue to strengthen national defense forces and consolidate national defense. The 1955 budget allocates 71.9315 billion yuan for national defense expenditures, accounting for 24.19% of the current year's total expenditure, which is entirely necessary.

The 1955 budget allocates 22.4156 billion yuan for state administrative management expenditures, accounting for 7.54% of the current year's total expenditure and decreasing by 1.24% compared to the proportion in 1954. Starting from July 1, 1955, the supply system for a portion of state workers who have not yet implemented the wage system will be abolished, and all will be changed to the wage system. The wages of village cadres who are paid too little should be appropriately adjusted.

The 1955 budget allocates 12.4533 billion yuan for credit, insurance, and other expenditures, accounting for 4.18% of the current year's total expenditure; the total reserve fund is 10.1723 billion yuan, accounting for 3.42% of the current year's total expenditure.

As mentioned earlier, the total revenue of the 1955 budget exceeds the total expenditure by 14.558 billion yuan, which is the remainder after deducting the 16.8694 billion yuan allocated to the state-owned enterprise departments to replenish working capital from the previous year's surplus of 31.4274 billion yuan. This remainder, after supplementing the local budget revolving fund of 851.1 million yuan, will be handled by the government based on the results of the execution of the 1955 national budget and the execution of the national bank's credit plan.

From the above explanation, it can be seen that the items and figures of our budget expenditures are all necessary. The majority of the budget is used for industrial construction, which is absolutely necessary for accelerating socialist industrialization, fundamentally improving the living standards of our people, and strengthening our national defense forces. The allocated total reserve fund is still insufficient. To both ensure the speed of industrialization that our country should have and make the fiscal situation more abundant, our way out is to practice economy and save as much as possible, making every yuan of funds not wasted, so that our construction plan can be completed and over-fulfilled with less money.

The aforementioned 1955 national budget revenue and expenditure are categorized and classified according to the nature of national revenue and expenditure. This figure includes both the central budget and the local budget. If classified according to the distinction between the central budget and the local budget, the central budget expenditure is 233.2688 billion yuan, accounting for 78.44% of the national budget and increasing by 25.47% compared to the expenditure in 1954; the local budget expenditure is 64.0984 billion yuan, accounting for 21.56% of the national budget and increasing by 6.1% compared to the expenditure in 1954. In the local budget expenditure, social and cultural education expenditures account for 39.86%, local economic construction expenditures account for 25.69%, and administrative management expenditures account for 26.01%. The main expenditures in economic construction are for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and local transportation.

In the 1955 local budget, in addition to the current year's expenditure of 64.0984 billion yuan, there is also a provision for the establishment of a budget revolving fund of 3.9253 billion yuan, of which 3.0742 billion yuan is carried over from 1954, and 851.1 million yuan is supplemented in 1955. This revolving fund is established to provide for the turnover needs of local areas when cash income is low and expenditures are high, and it must be returned when cash income is high and expenditures are low; whether used or returned, it is supervised by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, this revolving fund must be maintained for the long term and cannot be reduced.

The aforementioned distinction between the central budget and the local budget is in accordance with the principles of unified leadership and local conditions. The growth rate of the central budget is higher than that of the local budget, which is due to the need for the country to concentrate funds to ensure key construction and various national expenditures. The growth rates of various local areas in the local budget are different, with some areas growing faster and others growing slower or not growing at all, which is because the original economic foundations and conditions of various local areas are different, the distribution of national key construction areas is also different, and this is reasonable. The growth of minority nationalities' budgets is generally faster, which is also entirely reasonable, because these areas are economically and culturally backward and need greater financial assistance. However, in local financial issues, the scope of central and local revenue and expenditure and the responsibilities of various levels of local state organs in managing the budget have not been clearly defined, and some original regulations are no longer suitable for the current situation, especially the financial system of autonomous regions needs to be redefined. These problems must be solved this year.

Although the proportion of the local budget in the national budget is not large, more than 54% of the national budget revenue must be completed through local financial organs. Therefore, the work of local financial organs not only directly affects the completion of the local budget but also directly affects the completion of the entire national budget. Local people's congresses and people's committees at all levels must, based on the unified plan of the central government, on the one hand, seriously review and supervise the local budget and strictly ensure its correct implementation, and on the other hand, strictly ensure the completion of the national revenue tasks by local financial organs. This is one of the major tasks that local organs at all levels bear for the country.

Title: On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget
Author:
Date: 1955-03-25
Page: 1

From the content of the national budget for 1954 and the national budget for 1955, it can be seen that our national budget serves to develop the national economy in a planned manner, directly or indirectly to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and to consolidate the country's independence and defense capabilities. Due to the implementation of the 1954 national budget, we have achieved certain successes in developing the national economy, improving people's lives, and consolidating defense capabilities. The implementation of the 1955 national budget will further advance these achievements. Completing the 1955 national economic plan is of great significance for completing the first Five-Year Plan, and the primary goal of the 1955 national budget is to concentrate and supply a large amount of funds to ensure the completion of the 1955 plan. Struggling to achieve the 1955 national budget is a glorious political task for the Party, the government, and the people of the entire country.

To successfully implement the 1955 national budget, it is necessary for government departments, local people's committees at all levels, and leaders of various enterprises and institutions to strictly adhere to financial discipline, ensure the completion of production and sales plans for each enterprise, profit plans, and timely completion of various budget payment plans. It is necessary to resolutely eliminate the phenomena of not paying taxes on time and not paying profits on time and according to the plan. On the basis of increasing production and saving, and achieving the production plan and cost reduction plan, efforts should be made to exceed the budget payment plan. In addition to the responsibility of various government departments to regularly check and improve the financial situation of their subordinate enterprises and institutions and supervise them to accurately execute the budget payment plan, the financial departments should also actively take responsibility for organizing revenue and supervising and inspecting various departments and their subordinate enterprises to ensure the realization of the budget plan. For private industrial and commercial households, financial departments and industrial and commercial administrative departments must strengthen tax collection and management work and education on complying with tax laws, implement national policies, and prevent tax evasion.

The March 1955 National People's Congress of the Communist Party of China and multiple instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party have emphasized the importance of increasing production and saving, and opposing waste in current economic and financial work. At this conference, Li Fuchun, the Minister of the State Planning Commission, made important explanations about the issue of increasing production and saving in his report on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan. Now, from the perspective of financial work, based on the situation of the 1954 national budget and the requirements for the implementation of the 1955 national budget, and in accordance with the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the instructions of the State Council, I would like to propose some opinions on the issue of increasing production and saving, and opposing waste.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan started in 1953 and has now passed two and a half years. From the achievements of the past two years, although there are some difficulties in the financial situation during the first Five-Year Plan period, these difficulties are completely surmountable, and we are completely confident in solving the financial problems of the Five-Year Plan. The financial work in 1953, as Deng Xiaoping said in his report on the draft of the 1954 national budget at the meeting of the Central People's Government Commission in June 1954, had some shortcomings, but the implementation of the national budget was basically good. The 1953 budget ensured the funds needed by the state in the fields of economy, culture, and defense, and the revenue exceeded the expenditure. The financial work and budget implementation in 1954 achieved greater success on the basis of overcoming some shortcomings in 1953. As mentioned in the first part of the report, the implementation of the 1954 national budget was good. In 1954, both the state's financial work and the financial management of various enterprises and institutions made progress compared to previous years. The compilation of the national budget paid attention to the combination of national budget balance and bank credit plan balance. The management of the national budget further implemented the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, establishing the national budget on a solid and reliable basis, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of various regions and departments in managing finance. Compared with 1953, the financial management of production and construction units in the state-owned enterprise sector and the basic construction financial management of construction units also made progress. The state-owned enterprises' income remittance was more balanced and timely; the turnover of working capital in state-owned enterprises was faster; the progress of basic construction budget allocation was closer to the progress of project completion. These all created favorable conditions for the successful implementation of the 1954 national budget.

The successful implementation of the 1954 national budget is mainly due to the efforts of the workers and peasants across the country. They worked hard to develop production, overcame disasters and other difficulties, tapped various potential economic forces, and not only completed the production plan but also exceeded the plan in many projects. The working class used various methods to improve labor productivity and reduce costs, enabling the state-owned enterprises to greatly exceed the profit plan, which played a decisive role in ensuring the national budget revenue. In 1954, the labor productivity of production workers in state-owned and joint-venture industries nationwide increased by an average of about 15% compared to 1953, and the labor productivity of transportation and operation personnel increased by 12%. The six industrial departments under the Central Government (the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Ministry of Light Industry) increased production value by 1.0212 billion yuan in 1954 due to improved labor productivity. Among them, the labor productivity of enterprises under the Ministry of Fuel Industry increased by 3.39% compared to the original plan, and the production value increased by 124.37 million yuan; the labor productivity of enterprises under the Ministry of Textile Industry increased by 4.52% compared to the original plan, and the production value increased by 116.81 million yuan. Many state-owned enterprises actively relied on the masses of workers, adopted various relevant technical and organizational measures, and some enterprises even implemented economic accounting in each shift and group in the workshop, thereby greatly saving the consumption of raw materials and reducing production costs. In 1954, compared to 1953, the main technical and economic indicators showed that the standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity generation decreased by 2.1%, the coal recovery rate increased by 4.3%, the shale oil extraction rate increased by 10.4%, the effective volume utilization of blast furnaces increased by 4.7%, and the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased by 5.6%. In 1954, the six industrial departments under the Central Government increased national income by 210.59 million yuan due to exceeding the cost reduction plan. For example, the initial rolling mill of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company implemented "shift economic accounting" and "fixed-length steel cutting" in 1954, saving 17,000 tons of steel ingots throughout the year. The enterprises under the Rubber Industry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry made efforts to reduce the consumption of raw materials, saving 124 tons of mixed rubber throughout the year. The cotton textile mills under the Ministry of Textile Industry adopted "fiber impurity separator" and installed "cotton suction devices" in 1954, reducing the cotton consumption per piece of yarn from 394.5 jin to 393.4 jin, saving 2.81 million jin of cotton throughout the year. The railway transportation cost of the Ministry of Railways was originally planned to be reduced by 1.1%, but it was actually reduced by 3.27%; just the fuel consumption of locomotives reduced by 4.7% per ten thousand ton-kilometers saved 21,569 tons of fuel throughout the year. The Changsha First Warehouse of the China Food Company under the Ministry of Commerce improved the feeding and management of pigs, not only greatly reducing the phenomena of death, emergency slaughter, and starvation, but also achieving an increase in weight of 167,000 jin of all stored pigs from March 1954 to March 1955, excluding feeding costs, accumulating 387,000 yuan for the state. The Beijing Oil and Fat Company promoted advanced experience, producing 132,311 jin of edible oil and 12,258 jin of soybean paste in 1954; by using soybean meal instead of yellow soybeans to make soybean milk and other imitation foods, 156,000 jin of oil sources were expanded throughout the year. The Ministry of Food in 1954 adopted advanced Soviet experience in the design of grain warehouses, reducing the cost per square meter from 71 yuan in 1953 to 49 yuan, a reduction of about 31%. Other departments and units have many similar examples.

However, it must be pointed out that in our efforts to mobilize the masses, tap potential, increase production, practice thrift, improve systems, and oppose waste, there are still very serious shortcomings, so we absolutely cannot be satisfied with the status quo.

Basic construction funds account for a large proportion of national budget expenditures. Our country has achieved great results in basic construction, but there is also serious waste. The basic construction projects completed in 1954 were basically in line with the needs of the state, but there were still many projects that were not urgent or unreasonable, and many projects had their plans changed midway, all of which caused great waste. Generally speaking, the proportion of non-production investment (including various cultural and educational buildings, health buildings, public utility buildings, residential buildings, etc.) in the total basic construction investment is too high. In 1954, this proportion was about 24.3% nationwide, and in local areas, according to statistics from 28 provinces, municipalities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it reached 49.6%. The lack of planning in non-production construction can be seen from the following facts: in the past two years, various systems in Beijing have built 86 auditoriums, resulting in an average of only 20 hours of use per week. This situation is obviously inconsistent with the current need for our country to concentrate funds on key construction. There is also too much non-production investment in production construction. Many enterprises violate the principle of gradually improving the living conditions of workers on the basis of developing production and even spend a lot of money to build auditoriums, clubs, rest homes, and other welfare facilities before they have made profits from production, and build non-urgent green environments. The non-production construction investment of the six industrial departments under the Central Government reached 21.6% in 1953 and 1954, while the non-production investment in the industrial sector of the Soviet Union during the first Five-Year Plan period accounted for only 14.5% of the total investment.

Another serious shortcoming in the basic construction plan is the lack of correct quotas, so the design standards for factories and railways are generally high, and the design standards for civil buildings are particularly serious. The standards for civil buildings should be subject to the overall level of production development and the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of workers, and it is completely wrong to consider building standards without these conditions. Currently, living simply will not hinder industrial development, but rather, by freeing up funds, it is an important condition for industrial development. Some civil buildings have high construction costs but a low proportion of usable area to total construction area, and the waste here is shocking. For example, the average construction cost per square meter of the new building of the Beijing Hotel is 268 yuan, and the laundry room of a certain sanatorium in Beijing is 346 yuan. The small station in Mianyang, Sichuan, built by the Ministry of Railways, not only laid 14 tracks but also built 11 toilets, with a construction cost per square meter as high as 155 to 298 yuan. The Northeast Geological Institute under the Ministry of Geology, due to imitating the palace style, resulted in a construction cost per square meter as high as 220 yuan, and with the original foundation cost, it reached 300 yuan, exceeding the highest construction cost of college buildings stipulated by the state in 1954 by 140%. In the office building of the Black Metallurgy Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Anshan, the construction cost per square meter is 240 yuan, but the usable area is less than 50% of the construction area. The new dormitories built by the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have a minimum monthly rent of 18 yuan per household and a maximum of 41 yuan, which is 2 to 6 times higher than the old dormitories, and workers cannot afford the rent and do not want to move in.

Overestimating the cost of basic construction projects is also an important reason for waste. In 1954, the China People's Construction Bank reviewed 4,308 engineering design budgets, with a total budget value of 630.62 million yuan. Due to overestimating the quantity and cost of materials, labor, and miscellaneous fees, the construction cost was inflated by 49.86 million yuan, accounting for 7.88% of the total project value. In the first quarter of 1955, the bank reviewed engineering design budgets valued at 132.1 million yuan and found that the overestimated part accounted for 9.6% of the original budget. Among them, the design budget for the protective embankment of the Hankou Meat Processing Plant was overestimated by 29%, and the design budget for the Meishan Reservoir was overestimated by 24.92%. However, the engineering design budgets reviewed by the China People's Construction Bank currently only account for a small portion of the basic construction projects nationwide, and the waste contained in the remaining design budgets can be imagined. This overestimation of budgets allows some construction enterprises to obtain high profits even if they incur significant losses during construction. The profit rate of the East China Water and Electricity Installation Company in the first half of 1954 reached 32%, with the vast majority coming from the overestimation of construction costs.

In basic construction, due to the irresponsibility of some personnel in the construction units, errors in the preparation work, and poor organization and management during construction, the losses and waste are also very serious. The Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering built the Luohe Bridge without surveying, resulting in a loss of 700,000 yuan; the Dapozhuang Reservoir project in Liaoning, built by the Ministry of Water Conservancy, did not conduct a detailed survey of the local soil properties before construction, resulting in a direct loss of about 2 million yuan; the Engineering General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways had 970,000 man-days of stoppage and absenteeism in 1954; the Anshan Iron and Steel Company had 2 million man-days of stoppage and idle time in 1954, resulting in a loss of various materials totaling 5.97 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics from 1,112 construction units nationwide in 1954, after adjusting and processing 217.6 million yuan of accumulated materials, there were still 322.36 million yuan of materials left over. Some of these materials were accumulated due to early procurement that did not match the plan or specifications, some due to not carefully calculating actual needs and checking reserves when procuring, and a small part due to extreme carelessness. The Changchun Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering mistakenly included a railway special line that had been completed in 1953 in the 1954 plan and purchased 470 tons of extra rails.

The waste in the planning, design, construction, and financial aspects of basic construction, on the one hand, shows that various construction units and supervisory departments have not paid attention to the concentrated and strict use of funds, and on the other hand, also shows that the Ministry of Finance has not seriously reviewed and approved the financial plans and financial settlements of various departments, and the work of the China People's Construction Bank in supervising the allocation of funds is far from meeting the needs of national construction.

In the financial management of production, although the overall profit plan of the Central Government departments has been exceeded, 17% of the subordinate enterprises have not completed the profit plan. Some enterprises have a tendency to underestimate profits and overestimate costs when formulating profit plans. For example, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways planned a loss of 4.51 million yuan for the year, but actually made a profit of 1.9 million yuan. Some enterprises, although they have completed the cost reduction plan on the surface, have not actually reduced the costs according to the plan. Of the 211.29 million yuan in reduced product costs in the six industrial departments, 3.573 million yuan was due to the reduction in raw material prices. The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory reduced costs by 820,000 yuan for the year, of which 790,000 yuan was due to the overestimation of raw material prices in the plan.

Some enterprises did not complete the cost plan in 1954. Such enterprises include 29 in the Ministry of Heavy Industry, 4 in the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and 27 in the Ministry of Textile Industry. The First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry had 34 enterprises with cost overruns totaling 8.6 million yuan. The various railway bureaus of the Ministry of Railways had cost overruns and unplanned expenditures totaling 22.4 million yuan. One of the reasons for the cost overruns in enterprises is the loss of defective products. The six industrial departments had a loss of 52.16 million yuan due to defective products in 1954. According to a check by the Building Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the bureau lost 637,000 yuan due to products not meeting specifications. The scrap rate of cast iron parts in the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry reached 14.3%. Another reason for cost overruns is the waste of raw materials. The First Cement Plant of the Ministry of Heavy Industry unloaded materials into a water pit 1 kilometer away from the factory, submerging 6,500 tons of shale and 300 tons of gypsum. Poor labor organization and management, and high management costs also lead to cost overruns. The six industrial departments lost 19.3 million yuan due to stoppages in 1954. The ratio of non-production personnel to production workers in the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry was 24.5% in 1954, while in the Soviet Union's machine-building industry, this ratio was 7% to 8%.

The phenomenon of commodity loss in the trade sector is extremely serious. The Ministry of Commerce had excess losses of 34.5 million yuan in 1954, with the Food Company and the Department Store Company accounting for more than half. The Ministry of Food had excess losses and losses due to negligence totaling 22.93 million yuan in 1954. Errors in ordering and transportation in the Ministry of Foreign Trade also caused significant waste.

The railways under the Ministry of Railways issued 34,818 unfilled trains in 1954, with a total shortfall of 10.7632 million tons, equivalent to wasting the entire annual cargo transportation capacity of the Beijing Railway Bureau. The loss of transportation capacity due to single-engine operation and stopping outside the station signal machine all exceeded that of 1953.

Many enterprises did not complete the 1954 working capital turnover plan. The turnover of funds in some departments was even slower than in 1953.

The above-mentioned phenomena of underestimating profits, overestimating costs, waste, loss, and capital accumulation in production enterprises all seriously hinder the accumulation of funds for socialist construction. These phenomena not only indicate the shortcomings in the management of many enterprises but also indicate the shortcomings in the financial department's review of enterprise profit plans and financial supervision work. In addition, the accumulation of funds in some enterprises is to a large extent due to the excessive self-owned working capital allocated by the financial department and the lax bank credit system. Enterprises, in addition to being able to obtain a certain amount of working capital from the budget, can also borrow from the bank to make up the difference after the financial income and expenditure are offset, which in reality encourages the waste of funds in enterprises. The slow development of the bank's settlement work has not been able to actively promote the cancellation of commercial credit (mutual arrears, deferred sales, advance receipt and payment of goods, etc.) in state-owned enterprises, allowing enterprises with poor management to occupy other people's funds and cover up their financial shortcomings.

Waste also exists in the field of education and culture. In addition to the waste in basic construction, many colleges and universities have the shortcomings of too many administrative staff and poor control over equipment procurement costs. Harbin Institute of Technology has stored 80-plus lathes and instruments in the warehouse for two years without installation, but has purchased a batch of precision lathes and instruments that are not suitable for practice.

There is also waste in national administrative expenses. First of all, the staffing of government agencies is too large. The staffing of central-level agencies was 93,943 in 1954, but by the end of February this year, it had reached 100,731. Similar situations exist in the agencies of various provinces and municipalities. The administrative management fee budget, whether at the central or local level, is too high, and some expenditures lack definite expenditure standards and quota management.

Financial discipline is not strict. Many enterprises often delay the payment of profits and depreciation fees, illegally occupying them within the enterprise, causing losses to the national finances. Many departments, especially the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Health, do not submit economic activity reports and budget implementation reports on time as required, hindering the conduct of financial supervision work. Many units have the phenomenon of arbitrarily diverting funds. The eight basic construction projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company had an overrun of 8.97 million yuan in the 1954 settlement, of which, excluding the part that should be reviewed and handled by the investment department due to planning omissions and inaccurate project budgets, 36% was due to overreporting and double reporting. The units under the Ministry of Commerce diverted 3.9 million yuan of working capital for basic construction in 1954. The Hejiang Special District of Heilongjiang Province spent 200,000 yuan at the end of the year to buy various luxury items, even issuing blank receipts for items that were not purchased.

The lax financial discipline has provided an opportunity for corruption. Although in the "Three-Anti" campaign in 1952, state personnel and economic personnel had received a profound education on anti-corruption, and the phenomena of corruption and theft of state property had been greatly reduced, due to the lack of attention by many leaders to continue the anti-corruption education and struggle on this basis, and the lack of strict management of state property in many financial and economic work units, the phenomena of corruption and theft have recently begun to re-emerge in many units in the financial and economic departments. According to the financial supervision reports of 10 provinces and municipalities at the beginning of 1954 and 1955, among the 594 county-level and below financial and economic agencies and public institutions that were inspected, 1,079 people were found to have committed corruption in 1953 and 1954, embezzling 160,426 yuan in cash, 262,012 jin of grain. According to incomplete statistics from the national tax departments, 1,457 people were found to have committed corruption in the 18 months from the beginning of 1953 to June 1954, embezzling and stealing 177,667 yuan in taxes. In the same period, according to the inspection statistics of 18 provinces and municipalities in the state-owned commercial system, 1,826 people were found to have committed corruption, embezzling 263,379 yuan in cash. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that some leaders in the financial and economic departments have turned a blind eye to the corruption around them, allowing some corrupt elements to remain at large after embezzling and stealing state property. For example, a staff member of the Tax Bureau in Jinan, Shandong Province, used forged tax receipts to embezzle taxes, not only embezzling monthly but even embezzling daily until he was arrested by law on the day of his arrest, he still embezzled 70 yuan. In this way, he embezzled and stole 110,000 yuan in state taxes in 20 months. Can such a dangerous phenomenon not alert us to be highly vigilant and conduct strict investigations?

All the above situations indicate that the unnecessary losses of national funds are serious and intolerable.

Everyone knows that most of our annual revenue is used in the construction of the economy, culture, and national defense, and our achievements in these areas are enormous. In history, no government has been able to accomplish so many things for the benefit of the country and the people in such a short period. However, our problem is not to compare with the past, our problem is to ensure that national funds do not suffer any unnecessary losses. Our construction funds are still suffering such large losses, what is the reason?

Of course, we still lack the necessary experience in construction work. Due to the inaccurate formulation of plans, designs often lag behind construction and often have errors, many necessary quotas have not been established or have been established incorrectly, there is a lack of necessary technical strength in construction and production, there is a lack of reasonable organization and management, and the financial system is not perfect, the financial department lacks strict supervision of the national budget's income and expenditure, all of these are the reasons for the waste and loss of funds. However, the most important reason is the erroneous thinking of many state and economic personnel.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: many cadres lack economic awareness and do not understand the special necessity of practicing thrift and hard work in the construction period, which is the main reason for the production of most waste phenomena. Many cadres are only interested in the occupation of funds, but not in the accumulation of funds. They do not know that without the accumulation of funds, we cannot build socialism, and in order to accumulate funds, we must implement strict economic accounting and strict thrift systems, and ensure the reasonable, concentrated, and effective use of funds. Thrift is a method of the socialist economy, and it is the most important issue in the entire economic construction process at any time, and it is especially important in the current period of socialist construction and socialist transformation. We use a large amount of funds to build modern industry, especially heavy industry, because they can most quickly improve the country's economic situation and fundamentally improve the living standards of the entire nation; but if we use these funds to build "modern" offices, dormitories, auditoriums, and other non-production buildings, what contribution can they make to the national economic situation? Many leaders of enterprises and institutions have become accustomed to purchasing small cars, sofas, carpets, steel wire beds, and other high-end consumer goods, and to entertaining guests, giving gifts, and providing cigarettes and fruits, etc., almost feeling that without these, they cannot show that they are building socialism. On the contrary! The good days of socialism need to be created through hard work; if we do not work hard today and do not accumulate funds, there will never be good days tomorrow. We should strive to catch up with the latest achievements of the Soviet Union in production technology, but we should not catch up with the latest living standards of the Soviet Union, that can only be the result of long-term hard work by the entire nation, the development of industry and agriculture, and the increase in production; as for some state agencies and enterprise management institutions having office equipment levels and office expense levels higher than today's Soviet Union, that is even more unacceptable. Many leaders of enterprises and institutions also have a wrong idea, that is, they think their responsibility is only to complete the work tasks, and as for how much money their tasks will cost, what methods can be used to occupy and waste less state funds, what methods can be used to make the most economical use of state funds and manage them strictly, and accumulate the most funds for the state, those are all "minor matters," and they will make the mistake of "bureaucratism" if they manage them; these matters are not done well, their tasks are still "completed," and they are still at ease. They not only do not value economic accounting, do not value the analysis of their own economic activities, do not value the overall interests of socialist construction, but sometimes think that those who propose such requirements are looking for trouble with them. They always want to get money from the state as much as possible and as early as possible, the construction cost and production cost are always overestimated, the operating expenses and office expenses are always wanted to be more, and the profits and depreciation fees that should be paid are always wanted to be less and later. They do not want to align with the advanced standards when considering their national income tasks, and use various reasons to prove and forgive the backwardness of their units, but when it comes to requesting state expenditures, they are very active in comparing "generosity" with others. They are conservatives in production and adventurists in construction. Many people may not think this way subjectively; they advocate "wide planning and narrow use" when formulating expenditure plans, and "less listing and more collection" when formulating income plans, just thinking that this is "safe." But the actual result is the opposite: not only is it difficult to use the wide planning, but it is also difficult to collect more; and even if it is really done, it is to disrupt the entire national budget and cause the accumulation and false "excess profits" of funds.

To accumulate funds to build our motherland, all citizens should resolutely and mercilessly fight against these erroneous thoughts and styles, so that they will have no place to hide in the future.

It should be pointed out: the financial department should bear some responsibility for the spread of these erroneous thoughts and styles. The financial department has not seriously fought against these thoughts and styles in the past; the shortcomings and errors in the work of the financial department have directly caused some waste of funds.

The current task of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties and non-partisan persons, various people's organizations, government departments, and the people of the entire country is to carry out the struggle for increased production and saving, and to do everything possible to overcome waste phenomena, increase national income, save national expenditures, and enrich national financial reserves, accelerating the accumulation of funds for socialist construction. This is an important and necessary guarantee for the smooth implementation of the 1955 national budget.

To increase production and save, and to oppose waste, what specific steps should be taken?

According to the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, we must take the following steps:

First, in the industrial, transportation, and commercial sectors, efforts should be made to increase production and struggle to fully and exceed the national plan. On the basis of the national plan, the masses of workers should be mobilized to launch labor competitions, tap potential, increase the quantity and quality of industrial products, strive to develop new products and start production, reduce the rate of defective products, save electricity, coal, and raw materials, especially steel, wood, non-ferrous metals, grain, cotton, tobacco leaves, and oils; in the transportation sector, efforts should be made to improve transportation efficiency and the turnover rate of vehicles and ships; in the commercial sector, efforts should be made to reduce commodity circulation costs, especially to reduce the commodity loss rate; reduce all non-production expenses in enterprises, and strive to exceed the cost and profit plans. All these efforts must be for the full and excess completion of the national plan, that is, they must not be one-sided, sudden, and detached from the plan to pursue the superficial increase of output and output value, so as not to damage the quality and variety of products, the rhythm and proportion of production, and the health of workers and production equipment. In terms of cost reduction, the central departments in charge should set targets for exceeding the plan in addition to the indicators stipulated in the national plan, for example, industrial costs should strive to be reduced by 7.5%, transportation costs should strive to be reduced by 3.7%, and commodity circulation costs should strive to be reduced by 14%. To strive for the excess completion of cost and profit plans, state-owned enterprises should improve financial management, and the financial department should strengthen supervision over the production and finance of various enterprises. In agriculture, efforts should be made to complete the production plans for grain, cotton, oil crops, and other crops this year.

Second, in basic construction, in addition to the budget stipulating a 10% reduction in the original basic construction costs, under the condition of ensuring the completion of industrial construction according to the plan, efforts should be made to reduce costs by 15% in the second half of 1955 in other construction except for the main production equipment, and strive to continue to reduce the construction and installation costs of factories, railways, and other production construction. The design standards for various civil buildings must be greatly reduced, for example, the construction cost per square meter of offices and college classrooms should be reduced to 45 to 70 yuan, and the construction cost per square meter of residential buildings should be reduced to 20 to 60 yuan. Standard designs should be formulated and promoted as soon as possible in accordance with the principle of thrift.

Third, various departments in charge and the financial department should strengthen the review and supervision of the planning, design, and budget of basic construction, and the construction and allocation of funds, to eliminate waste at every link. The China People's Construction Bank should strengthen the supervision of basic construction funds, and strive to supervise more than half of the basic construction units nationwide in 1955, so that their design budgets are strictly reviewed, and the state's funds are strictly paid according to the actual progress of the project.

Fourth, in various agencies and public institutions, reduce the expenditure standards for operating expenses, procurement expenses, and office miscellaneous expenses, and also reduce the expenditure standards for this type of expenses in enterprises. Prohibit all wasteful practices, cancel mutual entertainment, gifts, and unnecessary hospitality with cigarettes and fruits, and establish the style of hard work for building socialism.

Fifth, streamline state agencies to strengthen socialist construction and avoid the waste of manpower and financial resources. All personnel who should directly serve production and construction should be transferred to production and construction positions as soon as possible, so as to give full play to the abilities and creative enthusiasm of the personnel, meet the urgent needs of economic construction units and grassroots production organizations, and provide appropriate training for some personnel who need vocational training, so that they can happily and competently enter the production front. For the remaining personnel, they should also be properly arranged under the premise of streamlining state agencies. To rationally use manpower, all state agency personnel and employees in state-owned enterprises should be subject to state assignments; at the same time, the state should appropriately solve the difficulties of the assigned personnel and employees. The shortcomings of excessive staffing in various public institutions, excessive non-production personnel in various enterprise units, and arbitrary recruitment of personnel by enterprises, resulting in enterprise personnel exceeding actual needs, should also be overcome under the principle of comprehensive saving.

Sixth, various departments in charge should actively improve and strengthen the work of formulating and managing quotas in the process of implementing the above-mentioned saving measures, so that these measures can gradually be legalized and institutionalized. The design budget quotas for various items in basic construction, the expenditure quotas for various items in various agencies and public institutions, and the personnel quotas for public institutions should all be revised according to the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Currently, the quotas for raw material consumption and working capital in various production enterprises are too high and should be revised.

Seventh, various financial systems should be gradually improved and financial supervision should be strengthened. In the next one or two years, a series of problems that urgently need to be solved in the financial system should be gradually solved, such as improving the budget and final account system, eliminating the phenomena of non-standard, incorrect, and untimely compilation and submission of budgets and final accounts; determining the scope and responsibilities of financial management of various levels of state agencies (including ethnic autonomous agencies); adjusting the transfer prices and bank interest rates; improving the situation of state-owned enterprises paying profits, preventing arrears and occupation; improving the methods of basic construction fund allocation and budget allocation of various units, preventing the misappropriation, diversion, accumulation, and waste of funds; determining the legal responsibilities of the chief financial officers of various units for the custody of funds, limiting the occurrence of corruption and waste; determining the basic methods of financial supervision and the basic principles of financial discipline, so as to systematically use the forces of financial and supervisory agencies to fight against waste phenomena, corruption phenomena, and other phenomena that violate national financial interests, so that corrupt elements are strictly punished by law, and those who waste and lose national funds are also punished economically, administratively, or criminally. Correctly solving these problems will greatly promote the progress of China's financial work and the financial management work of various units. In addition, banks should also improve the credit settlement work for state-owned enterprises and strengthen their financial supervision through their own business, so as to promote the struggle of increased production and saving, and opposing waste in state-owned enterprises.

Eighth, a mass movement should be launched to increase production and saving, and to oppose waste and corruption. The masses are the creators of wealth and the creators and promoters of all advanced experiences, and the masses can expose and overcome all the shortcomings in our work. Without the masses, we cannot implement the various measures mentioned above. Therefore, we must mobilize millions of people to increase production and saving, and to oppose waste and corruption, and through the power of the masses to improve various necessary systems. This means that we must turn our demands into the demands of the masses of workers in each enterprise, so that the grassroots masses of workers fully understand the figures of output value and costs of their units, and carry out shift economic accounting and other grassroots economic accounting work to strive for the excess completion of production plans, cost plans, and profit plans. This means that in various enterprises, agencies, and schools, a mass meeting or a representative meeting of an appropriate scope should be held annually under the leadership of the Party organization to discuss the financial situation and waste phenomena of the unit, conduct extensive criticism and self-criticism, propose various rationalization suggestions for increased production and saving, and pass appropriate resolutions for the responsible departments to implement. This means that in enterprises and agencies, the system of monthly or quarterly settlement meetings or expenditure inspection meetings should be gradually promoted, and the economic activities of enterprises or the expenditure situation of agencies should be analyzed at the meetings, and the participants' questions, criticisms, and suggestions should be listened to, and specific resolutions should be made under the leadership of the superiors, so as to continuously improve the financial work of various units under the supervision of superiors and subordinates, and continuously overcome waste phenomena. This means that the masses should be mobilized and encouraged to report to the government and Party supervisory agencies and expose to the media various phenomena that violate the principles of thrift, violate financial discipline, do not implement rationalization suggestions, and steal state property, so that financial work is placed under the supervision of the broadest masses and public opinion.

Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the joint efforts of state agencies and the people, we believe that we will gradually eliminate the current large-scale waste phenomena, gradually form a strict thrift system, accumulate sufficient funds for socialist construction, and through several Five-Year Plans, build our motherland into a great and powerful socialist industrial country. At that time, people will further realize that our current hard work is completely correct.

Comrades! The 1955 national budget reflects the interests of the state and the will of the people. The people support the state's construction and support the struggle to increase production and saving, and to oppose waste and corruption. The government is determined to rely on the people of the entire country to resolutely implement the 1955 national budget, resolutely launch the struggle to increase production and saving, and to oppose waste and corruption, to ensure the continuous improvement of China's economic and financial situation, to ensure the completion of the 1955 national economic construction plan, and to lay the foundation for the smooth completion of China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

    关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告
    ——在一九五五年七月六日的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼财政部长　李先念各位代表：
    现在我代表中华人民共和国国务院向第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提出关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。
      一、一九五四年国家决算
    一九五四年国家预算是在我国国民经济逐渐高涨的前提下实现的。预算执行的结果又帮助了国民经济的发展。
    一九五四年国家决算中收入总数为三百零七亿四千五百八十三万元（新币，下同），其中本年收入合计为二百六十二亿三千六百八十三万元，上年结余（包括历年存下来的结余）收入为四十五亿零九百万元。本年收入完成预算的百分之一一三·一五。在收入中，各项税收共收到一百三十二亿一千八百零八万元，完成预算的百分之九九·七四，占本年收入总数的百分之五○·三八；其中工商税收到八十九亿七千一百五十四万元，完成预算的百分之九四·四四；农业税收到三十二亿七千七百五十一万元，完成预算的百分之一一六·七四。国营企业收入收到九十九亿六千一百五十万元，完成预算的百分之一一九·五三，占本年收入总数的百分之三七·九七。信贷、保险和其他收入收到三十亿五千七百二十五万元，完成预算的百分之一九○·九八，占本年收入总数的百分之一一·六五。
    在一九五四年国家决算的收入来源中，除国外贷款外，国营企业向国家的缴款（包括上缴的企业收入和税款在内），占各种社会经济成分向国家缴款总数的百分之六五·二四。这说明了国营企业的缴款在我国社会主义建设的资金积累中已占多么重要的地位。
      一九五四年工商税收没有完成计划，这一方面是由于轻工业和商业受了水灾的影响，另一方面是由于公私经济比重的变化超过了预计的速度，一部分税款是以利润的形式缴给了国家。一九五四年的农业税收入因为公粮从财政部门拨交粮食部门的实际结算价格比预算中的预计价格为高，同时又把粮食部门补缴以往年度的公粮价款也列入本年度农业税决算，所以超额完成了预算。
      一九五四年信贷保险收入大大超过原计划数，除因公债收入超收二亿三千六百一十三万元外，主要是由于这一项收入中增加了苏联政府的贷款。这是苏联政府对我国建设的又
  一次慷慨的援助。
      一九五四年国家决算中本年支出合计为二百四十六亿三千二百四十四万元，完成预算数的百分之九八·七四。
      一九五四年国家决算用于经济建设的支出一百二十三亿五千八百二十二万元，为预算数的百分之一○九·一五，占本年支出的百分之五○·一七，居于各项支出的第一位。
      一九五四年在基本建设（包括经济、文教、行政各方面）完成的投资总额比一九五三年增加了百分之一五；其中各工业部比一九五三年增加了百分之三一，占一九五四年基本建设投资总额的百分之四八。进行建设的限额以上的工业建设单位有四百一十一个，中央五个工业部已全部完工的主要工程有三十三项。规模巨大的鞍钢的薄板厂和六号高炉、沈阳风动工具厂、重庆电厂等重大建设项目已经开始投入生产。炼铁、炼钢、采煤、发电、机械等工业的设备能力和固定资产有了很大的增加。
      一九五四年虽然部分地区遭受了严重的水灾，全年工农业总产值仍然比一九五三年增长了百分之九·四。工业总产值比一九五三年增长了百分之一七；其中国营工业增长了百分之二七。一九五四年同一九五三年相比，在工农业总产值中，现代工业所占的比重已由百分之三○上升到百分之三三。在工业总产值中，国营工业所占的比重已由百分之五四上升到百分之五九，合作社营工业所占的比重已由百分之三·四上升到百分之三·八，公私合营工业所占的比重已由百分之五·七上升到百分之一二·三，私营工业所占的比重已由百分之三六·八下降到百分之二四·九；同时，生产资料生产所占的比重已由百分之四一·二增加到百分之四二·三，消费资料生产所占的比重已由百分之五八·八下降到百分之五七·七。这说明我们的国家正在沿着社会主义工业化的道路逐步前进。
    一九五四年的农业、林业、水利、气象的拨款共达十三亿七千五百零八万元，其中包括防汛、抢险、堵口和复堤的费用二亿四千三百八十四万元。农业的拨款对于全国农业生产的改进、改良农具和农药农械的推广、农业病虫害的防治、水土的利用、畜牧兽医的发展都起了重要的作用。此外，一九五四年国家支出的以救灾为主的农村救济费三亿七千三百九十四万元，国家发放的农业贷款最高数达到九亿三千二百七十八万元，国家向农民收购的工业原料、土产、特产、副产总值达到六十亿元以上，这些也都使农民得到不小的利益。一九五四年全国各地方政府帮助农民新修和整修了许多渠塘堰坝，并贷放了水车十一万多辆，这就扩大了灌溉面积一千一百七十万余亩，改善了灌溉面积三千六百九十万余亩。在林业方面，一九五四年完成造林一千七百四十万亩，林区采伐后的迹地更新五十八万亩。一九五四年在水利建设方面共完成土方六亿五千万公方，石方八百七十九万公方，混凝土十九万公方。永定河的官厅水库、淮河的薄山水库和五河县以下干支流分流工程已全部完工，淮河的佛子岭水库已基本完工。这些水利工程在一九五四年防御洪水的斗争中收到了显著的效益。一九五四年全国农业生产虽因灾荒未能完成原定计划，棉花产量虽比上年有所减少，但由于全体农民的努力，农业及其副业的总产值以及粮食的产量仍然比一九五三年有所增长。一九五四年国营机械农场发展到九十七个，耕地二百七十八万亩；农业拖拉机站发展到八十九个，服务面积六十五万八千亩。到一九五四年底，全国农业生产合作社发展到将近五十万个，参加农户约占全国农户总数的百分之一一，经营的耕地占全国耕地面积百分之一四。
    手工业的生产和手工业的合作化在一九五四年也有发展。全国个体手工业的产值增长了百分之一一，手工业生产合作社的产值增长了百分之七六。组织到手工业生产合作社和生产小组的从业人数已达一百二十一万人，比一九五三年增长二·五倍。
    在交通运输方面，铁路货运总量完成了计划的百分之一○三，比一九五三年增长了百分之二○；汽车货运总量完成了计划的百分之一一七，比一九五三年增长了百分之四三。在一九五四年开始和继续施工的新建铁路十七条，其中一九五四年铺轨的有十二条，共铺轨八百三十一公里。沟通中、苏、蒙三国的集宁——二连线已铺轨完成，兰新线已越过乌鞘岭到达武威以西的九坝，宝成线已越过广元接近陕西省境。新建和改建的主要公路有二十条，共计五千八百二十八公里。贯通祖国西南边疆的工程艰巨的康藏公路和青藏公路已经通车。其他沿海航运、内河航运、民用航空和邮电事业比一九五三年都有发展。
      一九五四年全国社会商品零售总额达到三百九十一亿九千万元，比一九五三年增长了约百分之一二。全国社会商品零售总额中国营和合作社营商业所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之四一增加到百分之五八。同时，已经有大量的私营商户同国营商业、合作社营商业建立了代销、经销或代购关系。一九五四年的进口和出口贸易都超额地完成了计划，贸易总额比一九五三年增加百分之四·五。进口和出口大体平衡。
    随着工农业生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，人民的生活水平有了进一步的提高。一九五四年国营、合作社营和公私合营工业企业的职工人数增加了大约五十余万人，工资总额增加了百分之一九。职工的劳动条件和福利设施也有改善。全国享受劳动保险的职工已达五百三十八万余人，比上年增加了百分之一一。中央五个工业部门一九五四年为职工直接支付的劳动保险费、医药费、文教费和福利费，平均相当于工资总额的百分之一六·四。国家建筑的住宅面积完成了一千三百万平方公尺；如以每户占用二十四平方公尺计算，新建住宅可以解决五十四万户职工的住宿问题。一九五四年底，城乡人民的储蓄和上年同期比较，增加了百分之二六。
    一九五四年国家决算中，社会文教事业支出三十四亿六千零五十一万元，为预算数的百分之九四·三一，占本年支出的百分之一四·○五。一九五四年高等学校学生达到二十五万八千人，比一九五三年增加四万二千人；中等学校学生达到四百二十四万六千人，比一九五三年增加六十一万七千人；小学校学生达到五千一百一十九万人，因水灾影响比一九五三年略少。卫生部所属全国医疗病床达到十七万八千张，比一九五三年增加二万二千张。其他文化、科学、图书、出版等方面也都有新的发展。优抚和社会救济费支出六亿一千七百六十万元，其中优抚费支出一亿九千八百零二万元，社会救济费支出四亿一千九百五十八万元。如前所说，社会救济费的绝大部分用于农村，特别是灾区。
    一九五四年国家预算注意了少数民族地方的需要。一九五四年国家决算对少数民族地区运输交通投资约为一亿二千七百万元，教育支出约为九千六百万元，卫生支出约为三千一百万元。这些拨款以及同它们有关的各方面的工作，帮助了少数民族地区的经济状况和文化状况的改善。
    一九五四年国家决算中国防支出五十八亿一千三百五十三万元，为预算数的百分之一一○·三八，占本年支出的百分之二三·六；国家行政管理费支出二十一亿六千二百零七万元，为预算数的百分之九○·五六，占本年支出的百分之八·七八；信贷保险和其他支出八亿三千八百一十一万元，为预算数的百分之一○九·七七，占本年支出的百分之三·四。
    一九五四年国家预算保证了国家建设所需要的拨款。但是基本建设和其他某些支出项目的预算拨款没有用完，这除了由于节约，由于利用过去的积压物资，由于某些技术上的原因以外，更重要地还由于某些部门有“宽打窄用”的思想，在设计预算时没有严格核实，计算偏高。后面的这种情形不但造成了浪费的条件，而且直接积压了国家的资金，妨碍了国民经济的发展；这种缺点必须在今后努力加以消除。
    一九五四年国家决算中本年收入超过本年支出十六亿零四百三十九万元，加上一九五三年和一九五三年以前历年存下来的结余四十五亿零九百万元，本年结余共达六十一亿一千三百三十九万元。从表面上看，这是一笔不小的数字，但是它一般地并不能成为国家预算的实际收入，因为这笔钱已经通过银行存款的方式投入国家银行的信贷流通过程中去了。我们的国家财政和国家银行的信贷工作是互相结合互相支持的，国家预算的平衡同国家银行信贷计划的平衡是不可分的，因此，历年的财政结余已经陆续充作国家银行的信贷资金，贷给工业、农业、商业、粮食、合作等部门作为流动资金，而对于这些本来缺乏资金、却在几年内迅速大量发展的国营企业，这种支持是必要的和正确的。这样，历年的财政结余基本上不应再作财政支出之用；如果硬要从国家银行和国营企业部门抽回，就必然要破坏国家银行信贷计划的平衡，并使有关的国营企业的经营陷入混乱状态。过去几年内由于我们在编制国家预算时没有注意使预算的平衡同银行信贷计划的平衡相结合，把历年结余一年一年地都通过预算滚存下来，以致一九五四年国家决算中形成了这样一笔从表面看去数额很大、而实际上并不能完全支用的结余资金。为了使国家预算能够正确地表现这
  一情况，财政部已根据国务院的指示对上述六十一亿一千三百三十九万元的历年结余作如下的解决：转出已经作为地方预算周转之用的周转金三亿零七百四十二万元；归还革命战争时期和中华人民共和国成立初期政府向国家银行透支的款项二十一亿五千八百八十三万元；专户存入国家银行五亿零四百四十万元；其余三十一亿四千二百七十四万元转入一九五五年国家预算作为上年结余的收入，在一九五五年的国家预算中作适当的处理。上述归还历年财政透支和专户存入国家银行的两笔款项，实际上都早已充作国家银行的信贷资金贷放出去了。如上所说，过去几年来国营企业流动资金的很大一部分是通过国家银行采取贷款的方式解决的，而国家预算的历年结余存款则是国家银行发放这种贷款的主要的资金来源。所以现在把一九五四年国家预算中历年结余作上述的处理，是完全符合实际状况的。
    二、一九五五年的国家预算
    一九五五年是我国进入第一个五年建设计划的第三年，完成这一年国民经济计划，对完成整个五年计划有重大的意义。根据一九五五年三月中国共产党全国代表会议关于第一个五年计划草案的决议，一九五五年国家预算必须坚持贯彻增加生产、厉行节约的方针，以便积累资金，保证国民经济建设首先是重工业建设的需要，并保持相当的财政后备力量。
    一九五五年国家预算根据前一年度国民经济的发展和国家预算的执行情况，依照本年度发展国民经济计划的要求，规定收入总数为三百一十一亿九千二百五十二万元，其中本年收入合计为二百八十亿四千九百七十八万元，结转上年结余收入为三十一亿四千二百七十四万元；本年支出合计为二百九十七亿三千六百七十二万元，其中包括由上年结余增拨国营企业部门流动资金十六亿八千六百九十四万元；本年收入总数超过本年支出十四亿五千五百八十万元，成为本年结余。
    一九五五年国家预算同一九五四年国家决算比较，本年收入增长百分之六·九一（扣除苏联贷款和其他不可比的因素，实际增长百分之六·五五）；本年支出增长百分之二○·七二。支出增长这样多，一方面是由于财政支出适应国家经济发展的需要而逐年增长，由于一九五四年基本建设和其他某些支出项目的预算拨款没有用完，需要结转到一九五五年继续支用；另一方面，更重要的却是由于一九五五年国家预算中由上年结余增拨了国营企业部门流动资金十六亿八千六百九十四万元，用以偿还它们历年所欠国家银行的一部分债款，由于国防费用在苏联军队从旅顺口撤退后有了相应的增加，还由于一九五五年公债还本付息和偿还苏联贷款本息的债款支出比一九五四年增加了四亿一千五百三十万元。所有这些因素，就使一九五五年预算支出总数比一九五四年有了比较大的增长。
    一九五五年国家预算本年收入中，各项税收为一百三十七亿八千零五十七万元，占预算本年收入的百分之四九·一三，比一九五四年增长百分之四·二六。其中工商税收为一百亿元，占预算本年收入的百分之三五·六五，比上年增长百分之一一·四六，扣除不可比因素，实际增长百分之八·九五；农业税收入为二十八亿元，占预算本年收入的百分之九·九八，公粮征收数量仍维持一九五二年的水平。
    其次，国营企业收入为一百一十一亿一千五百八十一万元，占预算本年收入的百分之三九·六三，比一九五四年增长百分之一一·五九。国营企业收入所以有这样大的增长，除了由于国营企业的生产增长和商品流转扩大外，还由于国营企业的不断提高劳动生产率和降低成本。一九五五年计划规定，国营和公私合营工业的劳动生产率将比前一年提高百分之七，国营和公私合营工业生产成本将平均降低百分之六。国营和公私合营交通运输的成本将平均降低百分之二·七。国营商业的商品流转费用将平均降低百分之一二·九。
    信贷、保险和其他收入共列三十一亿五千三百四十万元，占预算本年收入的百分之一一·二四，比一九五四年增加百分之三·一四。其中信贷保险收入比一九五四年增加；而属于特殊性临时性的其他收入，则因财政逐年走向正规，比一九五四年减少。信贷收入的增加，主要是因为苏联政府在一九五五年五月底前自中苏共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退苏联军队时，除无偿地向我国政府移交了设备外，并以贷款形式转让了许多军用物资。苏联政府对我国这样巨大的援助表现了苏中两国牢不可破的伟大友谊的日益增长，我在这里代表我国政府向苏联政府表示深切的感谢。
    上述国家预算收入的来源，除国外贷款外，如果从各种社会经济成分缴纳所占的比重来看，同一九五四年比较有如下的变化：来自国营经济（包括上缴的企业收入和税款在内）的部分，由百分之六五·二四增长到百分之六九·四七；来自合作社经济的部分由百分之三·六五增长到百分之四·七七；来自公私合营经济的部分，由百分之一·六六增长到百分之一·九八；来自农民的部分（包括农业生产合作社），由百分之一四·二三下降为百分之一一·七六；来自私营工商业的部分，由百分之一三·三四下降为百分之一○·七；来自不同社会经济成分的其余部分，由百分之一·八八下降为百分之一·三二。这种变化的原因是：社会主义的经济将有更大的增长；私营企业将继续有一部分转变为公私合营；国家对农民仍继续实行稳定负担的政策。
    应当指出：鉴于一九五四年好几个省的农业遭受自然灾害，因而影响了去年的秋收和今年的很大一部分轻工业生产，一九五五年国家预算本年收入比一九五四年只增加百分之六·九一，而一九五四年国家决算本年收入却比一九五三年增加百分之二○·五六。因此，实现这个预算的收入计划应当说没有很大的困难。一九五四年预算执行的结果表明，在社会主义和半社会主义性质的企业中还存在着很大的潜力。努力发掘这些潜力，不但可以保证一九五五年的经济计划和财政计划的完成，而且还可以争取它们的超额完成。
    一九五五年国家预算支出的首要任务是根据发展国民经济的计划，保证发展重工业，并相应地发展轻工业、农业、交通运输业和文化教育事业。
      一九五五年国家预算规定经济建设支出为一百四十一亿八千八百七十六万元，比一九五四年增长百分之一四·八一，占本年支出的百分之四七·七二。在经济建设支出中，工业支出为六十三亿八千八百万元，占经济建设费总数的百分之四五·○二，比上年增长百分之一一·三二。其中：用于电力、煤炭、原油、冶金、化学、机械制造等重工业的拨款为五十六亿九千八百零七万元，占工业支出总数的百分之八九·二○；用于纺织、造纸、糖、食盐等轻工业的支出为六亿八千九百九十三万元，占工业支出总数的百分之一○·八○。农业、林业、水利、气象的支出为一十三亿一千二百二十一万元，占经济建设费总数的百分之九　·二五，比上年下降百分之四·五七。交通运输支出为二十一亿四千五百七十三万元，占经济建设费总数的百分之一五·一二，比上年增长百分之二一·八九。商业、粮食、对外贸易等部门的支出为二十八亿四千四百六十三万元，占经济建设费总数的百分之二○·○五，比上年增长百分之六一·五一。此外，储备物资支出、市政建设支出、公私合营企业投资支出和其他经济建设支出共为十四亿九千八百一十九万元，共占经济建设费总数的百分之一○·五六。
    一九五五年基本建设的规模是巨大的。全部国家预算支出中用于基本建设（包括经济、文教、行政各方面）的部分将有九十五亿九千一百六十四万元，占本年预算支出的百分之三二·二六，比上年增长百分之一○·四三。五年计划所规定的大批重点建设单位，将在今年开始施工或继续施工。本年内施工的限额以上建设单位共有一千零七十九个，其中本年开始建设的二百八十七个，继续建设的七百九十二个。苏联为我国设计的一百五十六个重要项目中，本年内开始建设的有三十七个，继续建设的五十四个。一九五五年建设的结果，中央五个工业部将有六十七个重大建设单位，包括鞍钢五号高炉、鞍钢十一号和十二号炼焦炉、吉林电极厂、抚顺发电厂、太原热电站、鹤岗东山立井、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳低压开关厂、北京第二棉纺织厂、西北第四棉纺织厂、广州造纸厂等，完成建设或完成重要工程的建设。某些新的工业城市将要在我国内地开始建设起来。计划规定的基本建设的建筑安装费用比上年约节约百分之一○。
      一九五五年全国工业总产值，将比上年增长百分之七·七；其中，国营工业增长百分之一一·二，合作社营工业增长百分之二一·三，公私合营工业增长百分之三三·九，私营工业可比部分增长百分之二·二。国营工业除棉纺业、卷烟业因上年水灾原料减产和部分机械工业在改制新产品过程中不能增产外，其他绝大部分的产品数量都比上年有所增长。中央各工业部门所属企业的产量增长情况是：发电量增长百分之一九·三，煤增长百分之
  一四·七，原油增长百分之三一·六，生铁增长百分之一三·八，炼钢增长百分之一八·三，水泥增长百分之二一·七，机制纸增长百分之八·九，糖增长百分之一七·八，盐增长百分之五○·一。
      一九五五年农业及其副业的总产值将比一九五四年增长百分之六·四。增长的速度比较大，是因为一九五四年各种农作物的产量的基数比较低。计划规定，本年内粮食产量比上年增长百分之五·三；棉花比上年增长百分之二○·六，烤烟比上年增长百分之三八，甘蔗比上年增长百分之一六。国营机械化农场将增加到一百一十七个，耕地四百三十三万四千亩；拖拉机站将扩大到一百零六处，服务面积一百二十万零五千亩。在粮食增产的条件下，饲养牲畜也要求有所增加。计划规定本年内开荒一千万亩，造林一千八百万亩，迹地更新六十万零六千亩。水利方面，本年内将在一九五四年冬堵口复堤工程的基础上，继续整理长江中下游、淮河、辽河、珠江和华北各河的堤堰，恢复洞庭湖湖滨的堤垸，增修黄河下游临时防洪措施，举办汉江下游分洪工程，续建河南南湾水库、安徽佛子岭水库和梅山水库、辽宁大伙房水库、安徽华阳河蓄洪垦殖工程，并治理淮河流域和河北等地的内涝；同时大力开展农田水利，扩大灌溉面积一千四百万亩。
    适应工业和国防建设的需要，交通运输也将有相应的发展。一九五五年铁路拨款一十四亿三千三百六十四万元，比上年增长百分之二五·九四。新建铁路将铺轨一千零六十一点九公里，其中兰新铁路将铺轨到张掖，宝成铁路在本年以内将完成大部工程，广西黎塘到广东湛江和北京丰台到河北沙城的铁路都已于本年上半年修成。铁路货运总量将增长百分之九·四，客运总量增长百分之二·七。一九五五年修建公路一千三百四十二点八公里，汽车货运总量将比上年增长百分之二七·六。沿海航运货运总量比上年增长百分之二二·三，其中国营航运业增长百分之一九·六。
    一九五五年全国社会商品零售总额预计将达到四百二十六亿元，比上年约增长百分之一○·四，其中国营和合作社营商业占百分之五一·七，私营商业（包括经销、代销和合营的部分）占百分之四八·三；同一九五四年相比，前者略有减退，后者略有增长，这是由于一九五四年前者进得过快的原故。公私商业主要商品的零售计划同上年比较都有不同程度的增长，其中，棉布增长百分之六·八，植物油增长百分之二○，煤炭增长百分之一○·八，糖增长百分之六·七，煤油增长百分之一·一，机制纸增长百分之一○·四，针织品增长百分之八·五，胶鞋增长百分之一一·七。
    一九五五年国民经济计划的实现，将使我国工农业总产值比上年增长百分之七。现代工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重将上升为百分之三三·七，而在工业总产值中，生产资料的产值将上升到百分之四五·一。各类工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，国营将上升到百分之五九·三，合作社营将上升到百分之四·三，公私合营将上升到百分之一五·四，私营下降为百分之二一。同时，将有不少的私营工商业要经过加工、订货、代购、代销、经销等国家资本主义形式，走上国家计划的轨道。手工业生产合作社将发展到二万二千八百个。农业生产合作社在本年春季已经发展到六十七万个左右，本年内将在坚持自愿互利的原则下努力巩固并继续积极发展。
    随着经济的发展和劳动生产率的提高，人民生活将有进一步的改善。本年内，国民经济各部门企业职工的平均工资（包括提级）将提高百分之三·三。一九五五年中央各部及其所属企业为职工修建的一千一百万平方公尺住宅完成以后，广大职工的居住条件将有进一步的改善。
    在物价继续稳定、币值巩固的前提下，本年三月发行了新的人民币，新币每元等于旧币一万元，消除了历史上通货膨胀所遗留的痕迹。新币的发行大大便利了货币的计算和使用，在发行过程中既没有使人民受到任何损失，也没有影响物价。这是我国经济状况健全的一个显著的标志。
    一九五五年国家预算规定社会文教事业支出为三十八亿五千零六十九万元，占本年支出的百分之一二·九五，比上年增长百分之一一·二八。
    在社会文教事业费内，文教卫生支出为三十一亿八千六百三十三万元。一九五五年全国高等学校新招学生九万一千一百人，在校学生将达到二十九万人，比上年增加百分之一二·四；中等学校新招学生一百六十七万人，在校学生将达到四百五十七万六千人，比上年增加百分之七·七七；小学校新招学生一千五百八十六万人，在校学生将达到五千五百零二万人，比上年增长百分之七·五。一九五五年卫生部所属全国医疗病床将达十九万九千张，比上年增长约百分之一一·六。一九五五年科学研究人员将增加百分之三六·三。在文化方面，一九五五年计划摄制和译制影片一百六十九部，出版图书九亿九千零二十万册。
    在社会文教事业费内，优抚和社会救济支出为六亿零一百一十六万元，其中优抚费二亿四千五百一十七万元，社会救济费三亿五千五百九十九万元。社会救济费中用于农村的救济费占二亿七千一百六十五万元。社会文教事业费中的其他支出为六千三百二十万元。
    我们的国家坚持和平政策。我国人民都在从事着建设伟大祖国的和平劳动。一九五五年我国预算中经济建设费和社会文化教育费占本年支出的百分之六○·六七，这就充分反映了我国人民和平建设的愿望。但是帝国主义者还在包围着我们，侵占着我国的领土台湾，并用新的世界战争威胁着我们。为着保卫我们祖国的独立，保卫我国神圣主权和领土的完整，保卫国家的建设，并解放我国的领土台湾，必须继续增强国防力量，巩固国防。本年预算规定国防费支出七十一亿九千三百一十五万元，占本年支出的百分之二四·一九，这是完全必要的。
    一九五五年预算规定国家行政管理费支出二十二亿四千一百五十六万元，占本年支出的百分之七·五四，比一九五四年的比重下降百分之一·二四。从一九五五年七月一日起，取消尚未实行工资制待遇的一部分国家工作人员的供给制待遇，一律改为货币工资制。对乡村干部的工资过低的，应作适当的调整。
    一九五五年预算规定信贷保险和其他支出一十二亿四千五百三十三万元，占本年支出的百分之四·一八；总预备费十亿零一千七百二十三万元，占本年支出的百分之三·四二。
    如上所说，一九五五年预算收入总数超过支出总数十四亿五千五百八十万元，这是上年结余收入三十一亿四千二百七十四万元减去拨给国营企业部门充实流动资金的十六亿八千六百九十四万元的余数。这笔余数除补充地方预算周转金八千五百一十一万元外，将由政府根据本年国家预算执行结果和国家银行信贷计划执行结果来处理。
    从以上的说明可以看出，我们的预算支出的项目和数字都是必要的。预算的大部分是用于工业建设，而这是为了加速社会主义工业化，从根本上改善我国人民生活以及加强我国国防力量所绝对必需的。预算规定的总预备费还很不充分。为了既能保证我国的工业化应有的速度，又使财政状况较为充裕，我们的出路就是厉行节约，尽可能地进一步节省支出，使每一元资金都不致浪费，使我们的建设计划能用更少的钱来完成和超额完成。
    上述一九五五年的国家收支预算是就全国收支的类别和性质加以区别的，这个数字包括中央预算和地方预算在内。如果按中央预算和地方预算的区别来划分，则中央预算支出为二百三十三亿二千六百八十八万元，占国家预算的百分之七八·四四，比一九五四年支出增长百分之二五·四七；地方预算支出为六十四亿零九百八十四万元，占国家预算的百分之二一·五六，比一九五四年支出增长百分之六·一。地方预算支出中社会文教费占百分之三九·八六，地方经济建设费占百分之二五·六九，行政管理费占百分之二六·○一。经济建设费中主要是农业、林业、水利和地方交通运输的支出。
    一九五五年地方预算中，除了本年支出六十四亿零九百八十四万元之外，还列有设置预算周转金三亿九千二百五十三万元，其中由一九五四年结转的部分为三亿零七百四十二万元，在一九五五年补充的部分为八千五百一十一万元。这项周转金的设置是为了供给地方在现金收入少而支出多的时候的周转之用，在现金收入多而支出少的时候则必须归还；无论使用和归还，都由财政部负责监督。因此，这项周转金必须长期保持，不能减少。
    对于中央预算和地方预算的这种划分是符合统一领导、因地制宜的原则的。中央预算的增长速度大于地方预算，这是由于国家需要集中使用资金，以保证重点建设和各种全国性的支出。地方预算中各个地方的增长速度不同，有的地方增长较快，有的地方增长较慢或者没有增长，这是因为各个地方原有的经济基础不同，条件不同，国家重点建设的地区分布也有不同，而这是合理的。少数民族地区预算的增长一般比较快，这也是完全合理的，因为这些地区的经济文化都比较落后，需要给以更大的财政上的援助。但是在地方财政问题上，中央和地方收支范围和地方各级国家机关管理预算的职责还有一部分没有明确规定，有一部分原有的规定已经不适合目前的情况，特别是民族自治区的财政制度需要从新规定，这些问题必须在今年内加以解决。
    地方预算占国家预算的比重虽然不大，但是国家预算收入的百分之五四以上都要经过地方财政机关来完成。因此，地方财政机关工作的状况，不但直接影响着地方预算的完成，而且直接影响着整个国家预算的完成。地方各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会必须根据中央的统一计划，一方面认真审查监督本地的预算并严格保证它的正确的实现，另一方面严格保证地方财政机关对国家收入任务的完成。这是全国各级地方机关对国家所担负的重大任务之一。
    三、增产节约，反对浪费，为完成一九五五年的国家预算而奋斗
      从上述的一九五四年的国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的内容可以看出，我们的国家预算是为有计划地发展国民经济服务的，是直接地或间接地为提高人民的物质文化生活水平服务的，是为巩固国家的独立和国防力量服务的。由于实现了一九五四年的国家预算，我们在发展国民经济、改善人民生活和巩固国防力量方面已经有一定的成就，而实现一九五五年的国家预算就要使我们在这些方面得到进一步的成就。完成一九五五年的国民经济的计划对于完成第一个五年计划是有重大意义的，而一九五五年的国家预算的首要目的，就是要集中和供应大量的资金来保证完成一九五五年的计划。为实现一九五五年的国家预算而斗争，这是党、政府和全国人民的光荣的政治任务。
    为了胜利地实现一九五五年的国家预算，这就要求政府各部门、各级地方人民委员会和各企业各机关的领导人严格遵守财政纪律，保证完成各个企业的产销计划、利润计划和按时地完成各种预算缴款计划，坚决地消除不按时缴纳税款和不按时不按计划缴纳利润的现象，并在增产节约、超额完成生产计划和降低成本计划的基础上争取超额完成预算缴款计划。除政府各部门应当负责经常检查和改善所属企业和机关的财务状况并监督它们准确地执行预算缴款计划外，财政部门尤其应当积极负责组织收入，并对各部及其所属企业进行监督和检查，以保证预算计划的实现。对私营工商业户，财政部门和工商行政部门必须加强税收的稽征管理工作和守法纳税的教育，贯彻执行国家政策，防止偷税漏税现象。
    一九五五年三月中国共产党全国代表会议的决议和中共中央的多次指示都曾着重指出增产节约、反对浪费在当前经济工作和财政工作中的严重意义。在这次大会上，国家计划委员会主任李富春同志在他的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告中已经对增产节约问题作了重要的说明。现在我从财政工作方面，从一九五四年国家决算的情况和一九五五年国家预算执行的要求方面，根据中共中央的号召和国务院的指示，再对增产节约、反对浪费的问题提出一些意见。
    我国的第一个五年计划是从一九五三年开始的，现在已经过去两年半了。从已经过去的两年的成绩看来，第一个五年计划期间的财政状况虽然有一些困难，但是这些困难是完全可以克服的，我们是完全有把握解决五年计划中的财政问题的。一九五三年的财政工作，如邓小平同志一九五四年六月在中央人民政府委员会会议上所作的关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告所说，虽曾有过一些缺点，但国家预算执行的情况基本上是良好的。一九五三年的预算保证了国家在经济、文化、国防等方面所需要的拨款，而且收入超过了支出。一九五四年的财政工作和预算执行情况，在克服了一九五三年的某些缺点的基础上得到了更大的成绩。如我在报告的第一部分所说明的，一九五四年国家预算的执行状况是良好的。一九五四年无论国家财政工作和各企业各机关的财务管理工作比往年都有进步。国家预算的编制注意了国家预算平衡和银行信贷计划平衡的结合。国家预算的管理进一步贯彻了统一领导、分级管理的原则，使国家预算建立在稳妥可靠的基础上，并充分发挥各地区、各部门管理财政的积极性。同一九五三年比较起来，国营企业部门的生产财务和建设单位的基本建设财务也有了进步。国营企业收入的缴库比较均衡和及时；国营企业中流动资金的周转比较迅速；基本建设的预算拨款进度同工程完成的进度比较接近。这些都为一九五四年国家预算的胜利实现造成了有利的条件。
    一九五四年国家预算执行得良好，基本上应当归功于全国的工人和农民。他们努力地发展了生产，战胜了灾荒和其他困难，挖掘了各种潜在的经济力量，从而不仅完成了生产计划，并且在很多项目中超额完成了计划。工人阶级用种种方法提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本，使国营企业利润计划得以大大地超额完成，这对于保证国家预算收入起了决定性的作用。一九五四年全国国营和公私合营工业生产工人的劳动生产率比一九五三年平均提高了约百分之一五，交通运输营业人员的劳动生产率提高了百分之一二。中央六个工业部
  （燃料工业部、重工业部、第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、纺织工业部、轻工业部）所属国营企业工人由于提高了劳动生产率，在一九五四年就增加了产值十亿零二千一百二十万元。其中，燃料工业部所属企业的劳动生产率比原计划提高百分之三·三九，产值增加一亿二千四百三十七万元；纺织工业部所属企业的劳动生产率比原计划提高百分之四·五二，产值增加一亿一千六百八十一万元。许多国营企业积极依靠职工群众，采取了各项有关的技术组织措施，部分的企业并在车间中推行了每班每组的经济核算，从而大大节约了原材料的耗用量，降低了生产成本。一九五四年主要技术经济指标同一九五三年相比，发电标准煤耗率降低了百分之二·一，原煤回采率提高了百分之四·三，页岩采油率提高了百分之一○·四，高炉有效容积利用程度提高了百分之四·七，平炉利用系数提高了百分之五·六。在一九五四年内，仅中央六个工业部所属国营企业由于超额完成了降低成本计划，就为国家增加收入二亿一千零五十九万元。例如重工业部所属鞍山钢铁公司初轧厂
  一九五四年实行了“班组经济核算”和“定尺切钢”，全年节约钢锭一万七千吨。轻工业部橡胶工业管理局所属企业努力降低原材料耗用量，去年全年共节约混炼胶一百二十四吨。纺织工业部所属棉纺织厂一九五四年普遍采用了“纤维杂质分离器”和安装了“吸棉器”，因而使每件纱的用棉量由三百九十四·五市斤降为三百九十三·四市斤，全年共节约棉花二百八十一万市斤。铁道部铁路运输成本原计划降低百分之一·一，实际降低了百分之三·二七；只是机车用燃料一项，由于每万吨公里消耗量比一九五三年降低百分之四·七，全年就节约了燃料二万一千五百六十九吨。商业部中国食品公司长沙第一仓库由于改进对生猪的饲养管理，不但大大地减少了死亡、急宰、饿瘦等现象，并且做到全部存猪从一九五四年三月到一九五五年三月长肉增重一百六十七万斤，除去饲养成本，为国家净积累资金三十八万七千元。北京市油脂公司由于推行先进经验，一九五四年全年增产食油十三万二千三百一十一斤，麻酱一万二千二百五十八斤；由于用豆饼代替黄豆制豆浆等复制食品，全年就扩大油源十五万六千斤。粮食部一九五四年在粮食仓库的设计方面采用了苏联先进经验，使每平方公尺的造价由一九五三年的七十一元降低到四十九元，即比一九五三年降低了约百分之三一。其他部门和其他单位还有很多类似的事例。
    但是必须指出，我们在努力动员群众、发掘潜力、增加生产、厉行节约、健全制度、反对浪费的斗争中还是有很严重的缺点，因此我们绝对不能满足于现状。
    基本建设拨款占国家预算支出的很大比重。我国在基本建设方面已经有了伟大的成绩，但是也有严重的浪费。在一九五四年完成的基本建设工程，基本上是符合国家需要的，但还有不少工程项目是不急需的或不合理的，也还有不少项目的计划中途改变，这些都造成很大的浪费。一般地说，非生产性投资（包括各种文化教育建筑、卫生建筑、公用事业建筑、住宅等建筑的投资）在基本建设投资总额中所占的百分比太高。在一九五四年这个百分比在全国约达百分之二四·三，而在地方范围内，根据二十八个省市和内蒙古自治区的统计，则达百分之四九·六。非生产性建设的无计划性可以从下面的事实看出来：北京各系统机关在过去两年建筑了八十六个礼堂，结果平均每周只利用二十小时。这种情况，显然是同目前我国必须集中资金用于重点建设的方针不相符合的。在生产建设中的非生产性投资也过多。许多企业违反在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活的原则，甚至在还没有生产赢利的时候就已经花了很多钱办礼堂、俱乐部、休养所等福利设施，建设非急需的绿化环境。中央六个工业部在一九五三和一九五四年非生产性的建设投资高达百分之二一·六，而苏联工业部门的非生产性投资在第一个五年计划时期只占全部投资的百分之一四·五。
    基本建设计划中另一个严重的缺点是缺乏正确的定额，因此工厂、铁路的设计标准都
  一般地偏高，而民用建筑中设计标准过高的情形尤其严重。民用建筑的标准应当服从于整个生产发展的程度和广大劳动人民生活改善的程度，脱离这些条件去考虑建筑标准是完全错误的。目前，人住得简朴些，不但不会妨碍工业的发展，而且由于腾出了资金，正是工业发展的重要条件。有些民用建筑造价很高而使用面积所占建筑面积的百分比很低，这里的铺张浪费是惊人的。以每平方公尺的平均造价来说，北京饭店新楼高达二百六十八元，北京某疗养院洗衣房高达三百四十六元。铁道部在四川绵阳的一个小车站，不但铺了十四股道，而且修了十一个厕所，每平方公尺造价高达一百五十五元到二百九十八元。地质部所属东北地质学院，由于模仿宫殿式，使每一平方公尺造价高达二百二十元，加上原有基础的造价，则达三百元，超过一九五四年国家规定高等学校校舍最高造价每平方公尺一百二十五元的百分之一百四十。在鞍山的重工业部黑色冶金设计院办公大楼，每平方公尺造价二百四十元，而使用面积却不够建筑面积的百分之五十。齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂新盖职工宿舍，由于标准过高，每户房租最低一个月十八元，最高四十一元，比旧宿舍高二倍至六倍，工人因为出不起房租，不愿意进去住。
    对基本建设的工程成本估算过高也是产生浪费的重要原因之一。在一九五四年中国人民建设银行审查的四千三百零八件工程设计预算中，预算总值共六亿三千零六十二万元，由于高估工料数量工料费用和运杂费用等原因而高估了工程造价，抬高了预算四千九百八十六万元，占工程总值的百分之七·八八。该行一九五五年第一季度审查了价值一亿三千二百一十万元的工程设计预算，发现高估的部分占原预算百分之九·六，其中汉口肉类联合加工厂护岸工程的设计预算高估了百分之二九，梅山水库设计预算高估了百分之二四·九二。但是经过中国人民建设银行审查的工程设计预算目前还只占全国基本建设工程的一小部分，其余设计预算中所包含的浪费可以想见。这种抬高预算的情形就使不少建筑企业虽然在施工中有很大的损失浪费，仍然能得到高额利润。华东水电安装公司一九五四年上半年的利润率竟达百分之三二，其绝大部分就是由于设计预算高估成本得来的。
    在基本建设中，由于建设单位的部分工作人员不负责任、由于在施工准备工作中的错误、由于施工过程中组织和管理不好而造成的损失和浪费，也很严重。建筑工程部洛阳工程局修建洛河大桥，未经测量即行开工，损失了七万元；水利部辽宁大伙房水库土坝工程，由于事前对当地土壤性质未作详细调查，开工后被迫停工，仅直接损失就达到二百万元左右；铁道部工程总局一九五四年停工旷工共达九十七万余工日；鞍山钢铁公司一九五四年停工窝工共二百余万工日，损失各种材料共达五百九十七万元。据一九五四年全国一千一百一十二个施工单位不完全的统计，历年积压的器材，经过调剂处理了二亿一千七百六十万元以后，仍达三亿二千二百三十六万元。这些器材的积压，一部分是由于备料过早不合计划不合规格，一部分由于备料时没有切实地计算实际需要和检查储备，也有一小部分简直是由于极端的粗心。建筑工程部直属长春工程公司，就是由于误将一九五三年已经完工的铁道专用线列入了一九五四年计划，就多买了钢轨四百七十吨。
      基本建设的计划、设计、施工、财务等方面的浪费，一方面说明了各个建设单位和主管部门没有重视有重点地使用资金和严格节约地使用资金，另一方面也说明了财政部没有认真地审查和核定各部门基本建设财务计划和财务决算，说明了中国人民建设银行在拨款监督方面的工作还远远落后于国家建设的需要。
      在生产财务方面，一九五四年中央各部总的利润计划虽已超额完成，但所属的企业仍有百分之一七的单位没有完成利润计划。有些企业在编制利润计划时都有低估利润和高估成本的倾向。例如铁道部太原铁路管理局全年计划亏损四百五十一万元，实际上却盈余了一百九十万元。有些企业虽然表面上完成了降低成本计划，实际成本却并没有按计划降低。在中央六个工业部所降低的产品成本二亿一千一百二十九万元中，就有三千五百七十三万元是由于原材料价格降低所造成的。沈阳低压开关厂全年降低成本八十二万元，其中竟有七十九万元是由于计划规定的原材料价格过高的结果。
    有一部分企业在一九五四年没有完成成本计划。这样的企业重工业部有二十九个，燃料工业部有四个，纺织工业部有二十七个。第一机械工业部有三十四个企业成本超支达八百六十万元。铁道部各路局成本超支和无计划支出达二千二百四十万元。形成企业成本超支的原因之一是废品损失。中央六个工业部一九五四年废品损失五千二百一十六万元。根据重工业部建筑工业材料局检查，该局因产品质量不够规格，损失六十三万七千元。第一机械工业部铸铁件废品率达百分之一四·三。成本超支的另一个原因是原材料的浪费。重工业部第一水泥厂将材料卸在离厂一公里的水坑里，淹没页岩六千五百吨，石膏三百吨。劳动组织管理不好和管理费用过高也造成成本的超支。中央六个工业部一九五四年因为停工一项就损失了一千九百三十万元。第一机械工业部非生产人员对生产工人的比例，在一九五四年为百分之二四·五，而在苏联机械工业中这一比例却是百分之七至八。
    贸易部门商品损耗现象极其严重。商业部一九五四年仅超额损耗即达三千四百五十万元，其中食品公司和百货公司合占半数以上。粮食部一九五四年超额损耗和失职所造成的损失达二千二百九十三万元。对外贸易部在订货、运输中的错误也造成了很大的浪费。
    铁道部所属全国铁路在一九五四年共编发了三万四千八百一十八列不满轴列车，共欠重一千零七十六万三千二百零七吨，等于浪费了一个北京铁路管理局全年的货运能力。由于单机走行和在车站信号机外停车而形成的运输力量的损失，都超过了一九五三年。
    许多企业没有完成一九五四年的流动资金周转计划。有些部门的资金周转，比一九五三年还慢。
    上述这些生产企业中的低估利润、高估成本、浪费、损失和资金积压现象，都严重地妨碍着社会主义建设资金的积累。这些现象，不但表明了许多企业的经营管理方面的缺点，而且表明了财政部门审核企业利润计划和对它们进行财政监督工作中的缺点。此外，某些企业中的资金积压，在很大的程度上，也是由于财政部门规定给它们的自有流动资金过多和银行信贷制度不严。企业除了可以从预算上领取一定的流动资金外，其余一切财务收支相抵后的差额，还可以向银行去借款弥补，这在实际上就助长了企业中资金的浪费。银行的结算工作开展迟缓，没有能积极促进国营企业取消商业信用（互相拖欠、赊销，预收预付货款等），也使经营不善的企业可以占用别人的资金，掩盖自己财务上的缺点。
    浪费现象在文教事业中也存在着。除了基本建设中的浪费以外，许多高等学校还有行政职工人数过多和设备购置费用控制不严的缺点。哈尔滨工业大学在库房存放着八十多台的车床和仪器两年没有安装，却又买进了一批不该做实习用的精密的车床和仪器。
    在国家行政费用中也有浪费。首先是机关人员编制过大。中央一级机关，在一九五四年编制数是九万三千九百四十三人，到今年二月底已达十万零七千三百一十二人。在各省市机关中也有类似的情形。行政管理费预算，无论中央和地方都偏高，并且有一部分开支还缺乏一定的开支标准和定额管理。
    财政纪律还不严格。许多企业常常迟缴利润和折旧费，而将其留在企业中非法占用，使国家财政受到损失。许多部门尤其是商业部、建筑工程部、林业部、粮食部、高等教育部和卫生部，不按规定时间编送经济活动的表报和预算执行情况的表报，妨碍了财政监督工作的进行。许多单位有任意挪用资金的现象。鞍山钢铁公司八个基本建设项目，在一九五四年决算中共超支八百九十七万元；其中，除属计划遗漏、工程预算不准确部分应由投资部门审查处理外，属于虚报重报的占百分之三六。商业部所属单位，在一九五四年内，挪用流动资金进行基本建设的款项共达三百九十万元。黑龙江省合江专署为了少缴结余，年终抢花钱两万余元，购置各种奢侈品，甚至没有买到的也要合作社先开空头收据报销。
    财政纪律不严给贪污现象开了门。虽然在一九五二年“三反”运动中，国家工作人员和经济工作人员曾经普遍地受到了一次深刻的反贪污的教育，贪污和盗窃国家资财的现象已大为减少，但是由于许多领导人员没有注意在这一基础上经常地进行反贪污的教育和斗争，加上许多财政经济工作单位对于管理国家财产缺乏严密的制度，以致贪污盗窃现象近来又在财政经济部门的许多单位中有了滋长。根据一九五四年和一九五五年年初十个省市的财政监察报告，在经过检查的五百九十四个县区以下的财政经济机关和事业机关中，在一九五三、一九五四年两年内共发现犯贪污的人员一千零七十九人，贪污现款十六万零四百二十六元，粮食二十六万二千零一十二斤。另据全国税务部门不完全的统计，在一九五三年年初至一九五四年六月的一年半时间内，就发现了犯贪污的人员一千四百五十七人，贪污盗窃税款十七万七千六百六十七元。在同一时期内，据国营商业系统十八个省市的检查统计，发现了犯贪污的人员一千八百二十六人，贪污现款二十六万三千三百七十九元。问题的严重性还在于某些财经部门的领导人员对于自己身旁发生的贪污现象熟视无睹，使得有的贪污分子在贪污和盗窃了国家财产之后，长期逍遥法外。例如山东省济南市税务局有
  一个工作人员长期用虚填税票的方法贪污税款，不仅月月贪污，甚至有一段时间内天天贪污，直到被依法逮捕的当天，他还贪污了七十元。就是这样，他在二十个月的时间内，贪污盗窃了国家税款达一万一千余元。这种危险的现象能不引起我们极大的警惕并进行严格的查究吗？
    以上的一切情形，说明国家资金的不应有损失是严重的，是不能容忍的。
    大家都知道，我们每年的收入的大部分都用在经济、文化和国防的建设方面，在这些方面我们的成就是巨大的。历史上没有任何一个政府能够在这样短的时间里办这么多福国利民的事。但是我们的问题不是要同过去比较，我们的问题是要保障国家资金不受任何不应有的损失。我们的建设资金现在还受到这样大的损失，原因究竟在哪里呢？
    当然，我们在建设工作中还缺少必要的经验。由于计划制定得不准确，设计常常赶不上施工并且常有错误，许多必要的定额还没有规定或者规定得不正确，在施工和生产中缺乏必要的技术力量，缺乏合理的组织和管理，加上财政制度不完善，财政部门对于国家预算的收入和支出又缺乏严格的监督，所有这些，都是形成资金的浪费和损失的原因。但是最重要的原因，却是很多国家工作人员和经济工作人员的思想上的错误。
    中共中央和毛泽东同志指出：很多工作人员缺乏经济观点，不了解在建设时期厉行节约和艰苦奋斗的特殊必要，这是大部分浪费现象得以产生和发展的主要原因。很多工作人员只对资金的占用有兴趣，而对资金的积累却不感兴趣。他们不知道，没有资金的积累，我们就不能建设社会主义，而为了积累资金，就必须实行严格的经济核算和严格的节约制度，就必须保证资金的合理的、集中的、有效的使用。节约是社会主义经济的方法，在整个经济建设过程中的任何时候都是头等重要的问题，而在目前社会主义建设和社会主义改造时期尤其重要。我们用大量的资金建设现代化的工业，特别是重工业，这是因为它们可以最迅速地改进国家的经济状况，从根本上提高全国人民的生活水平；但是，如果我们用这些资金来建设“现代化”的办公室、宿舍、礼堂和其他非生产性建筑，那么，它们能对全国经济状况有什么贡献呢？很多企业和机关的领导者对于购置小汽车、沙发、地毯、钢丝床以及其他高级消费品，对于请客、送礼、招待纸烟水果等等，简直是习以为常了，几乎觉得非此不足以表现他们是在建设社会主义。恰恰相反！社会主义的好日子是需要艰苦奋斗来创造的；今天不艰苦奋斗，不积累资金，就永远不会有明天的好日子。苏联在生产技术上的一切最新成果，我们要尽可能“迎头赶上”，但是苏联在生活消费上的最新水平，我们却决不能也来“迎头赶上”，那只能是全国上下长时期艰苦奋斗、工农业生产大量发展的结果；至于我们有些国家机关和企业管理机构的办公室设备水平和办公费用水平比今天的苏联还要高，这就是更加不能容许的错误了。很多企业和机关的领导者还有一种错误的想法，就是以为他们的责任只是完成工作任务，至于他们的任务要花多少钱，有什么方法可以少占用和少耗费国家的资金，有什么方法可以把国家的资金运用得最为经济，管理得最严格，并且为国家积累最多的资金，那就都是一些“小事情”，他们管起来就该犯“事务主义”的错误了；这些事办得不好，他们的任务还是“完成”了，他们还是心安理得的。他们不但不重视经济核算，不重视本企业经济活动的分析，不重视社会主义建设的整体利益，有时还认为提出这种要求的人是跟他们找麻烦。他们向国家要钱的时候总是要得愈多愈早愈好，建设的成本和生产的成本总是要高估，事业费、办公费总是要多支，而对应当上缴的利润、折旧费等等总是希望交得少些，晚些。他们在考虑他们所担负的国家收入任务的时候，不愿意向先进的标准看齐，拿出种种理由来证明和原谅本单位的落后，而到要求国家支出的时候却很积极地同人家比“阔气”。在生产方面他们是保守派，在建设方面他们却是冒进派。有许多人也许主观上不是这样想的；他们在制定支出计划的时候主张
  “宽打窄用”，在制定收入计划的时候主张“少列多收”，只是以为这样才“稳当”。而实际上的结果却相反：不但宽打很难窄用，少列也不容易多收；而且即令真的做到了，也是破坏了整个国家的预算，并且造成资金的积压和虚假的“超额利润”。
    为了积累资金来建设我们的祖国，我们全体公民都应当同这些错误的思想和作风展开坚决无情的斗争，使它们今后再没有容身之地。
    应当指出：对于这些错误的思想和作风的流行，财政部门要负一定的责任。财政部门过去没有同这些思想和作风进行严肃的斗争；财政部门工作中的缺点和错误还直接造成了一些资金的浪费。
    中国共产党、各民主党派和无党派人士、各人民团体、政府各部门和全国人民的当前任务就是要贯彻增产节约的斗争，尽一切可能来克服浪费现象，来增加国家的收入，节省国家的支出，来充实国家的财政后备，加速社会主义建设资金的积累。这是顺利完成一九五五年国家预算的重要的和必要的保证。
    为了增产节约，反对浪费，需要采取哪些具体步骤呢？
    根据国务院和中共中央的指示，我们必须采取如下的步骤：
    第一，在工业、运输业、商业各部门中要努力增加生产，为全面地完成和超额完成国家计划而斗争。要在国家计划的基础上动员广大职工群众开展劳动竞赛，挖掘潜力，在工业中努力提高产品的数量和质量，努力试制新产品并开始生产，降低废次品率，节约用电、用煤，节约原材料特别是钢材、木材、有色金属、粮食、棉花、烟叶、油脂等；在运输业中努力提高运输效率和车辆船舶周转率；在商业中努力降低商品流转费用特别是降低商品损耗率；减少一切企业中的非生产性开支，努力争取超额完成成本计划和利润计划。一切这些努力，必须是为着全面地完成和超额完成国家计划，这就是说，必须不是片面地、突击式地和脱离计划地争取产量和产值的表面增加，以免反而破坏了产品质量和品种的计划，破坏了生产的节奏和比例，损害了工人健康和生产设备。在降低成本方面，中央各主管部除国家计划规定的指标外，应当定出超额完成计划的指标作为奋斗的目标，例如工业成本应争取降低百分之七·五，交通运输成本应争取降低百分之三·七，商品流转费用应争取降低百分之一四。为着争取超额完成成本计划和利润计划，国营企业应当切实改善财务管理工作，财政部门应当加强对各企业生产财务的监督。在农业方面，要努力完成今年的粮食、棉花、油料和其他作物的生产计划。
    第二，在基本建设方面，除了预算已规定节约基本建设的原定费用百分之一○以外，在保证工业建设按计划完成的条件下，一九五五年下半年要争取在除生产性建设主要设备外的其他建设中再节约费用百分之一五左右，并争取继续降低工厂、铁路和其他生产性建设的建筑安装成本。必须大大降低各种民用建筑的设计标准，例如办公室和高等学校教室每平方公尺降至四十五到七十元，住宅每平方公尺降至二十到六十元。必须迅速按厉行节约的原则制定和推行标准设计。
    第三，各主管部门和财政部门要加强对于基本建设的计划、设计、预算的审核和施工、拨款的监督，力求消除每一环节的浪费。应当加强中国人民建设银行对基本建设拨款的监督，争取在一九五五年内对全国半数以上的基本建设单位进行这种监督，使它们的设计预算都受到严格的审查，使国家的拨款严格按照工程的实际进度支付。
    第四，在各机关和各事业单位降低事业费、购置费和办公杂支费的开支标准，各企业的这类费用的开支标准也实行降低。禁止一切铺张浪费，取消相互间的请客、送礼和纸烟水果等不必要的招待，树立为建设社会主义而艰苦奋斗的作风。
    第五，精简国家机关，以便加强社会主义建设事业，避免人力和财力的浪费。凡是应当直接为生产和建设服务的工作人员都必须尽先抽调到生产和建设的岗位上去，以便发挥工作人员的能力和创造性积极性，满足经济建设单位和基层生产组织的迫切需要，并且给一部分需要职业训练的人员以适当的训练，以便使他们胜任愉快地转入生产战线。对其余人员，也都应当在精简国家机关的前提下，给以妥善的安置。为了合理地使用人力，一切国家机关工作人员和国营企业中的职工，都应当服从国家的调动；同时，国家也应当对被调动的职工和工作人员的困难，予以适当的解决。各事业单位编制过大、各企业单位非生产人员过多以及各企业任意招收职工使企业职工超过实际需要等缺点，也应当在实行全面节约的原则下加以克服。
    第六，各主管部门应当在执行上述各项节约措施的过程中积极改善和加强制定定额的工作和定额管理工作，以便使这些措施逐步地法律化，制度化。基本建设的各项设计预算定额，各机关和事业单位的各项费用定额，事业单位的人员定额，都应当根据国务院和中共中央的指示进行修订。目前各生产企业的原材料消耗定额和流动资金定额都偏高，也应当加以修改。
    第七，应当有准备有步骤地健全各种财政制度，加强财政监督。在最近一两年内，应当陆续解决一系列的在财政制度方面急须解决的问题，例如改善预算决算制度，消除预算决算的编制和报送不严格不正确不及时的现象；确定各级国家机关（包括民族自治机关）管理财政的范围和责任；调整调拨价格和银行利息；改善国营企业缴纳利润的状况，防止拖欠和占用；改善基本建设的拨款办法和各单位预算拨款的办法，防止资金的冒领、挪用、积压和浪费；确定各单位的会计主管人员对出纳款项的法律上的责任，限制贪污浪费现象的发生；确定财政监督的基本方法和财政纪律的基本原则，以便于经常利用财政机关和监察机关的力量来向浪费现象、贪污现象和其他违反国家财政利益的现象作有系统的斗争，使贪污分子受到法律的严格制裁，而浪费和损失国家资金的人员也受到经济上、行政上或刑法上应得的处分；等等。正确地解决这些问题将使我国的财政工作和各单位的财务管理工作得到巨大的进步。此外，银行也应当改进对国营企业的信贷结算工作，并通过自己的业务加强对它们的财政监督，以便促进国营企业中增产节约、反对浪费的斗争。
    第八，要开展增产节约、反对浪费和贪污的群众运动。群众是财富的创造者和各种先进经验的创造者、推广者，群众能够揭露并且克服我们工作中的一切缺点，离开群众，我们在上面所说的各种措施是无法贯彻的。因此，我们必须动员千百万群众起来增产节约，反对浪费和贪污，并且经过群众的力量来健全各种必要的制度。这就是说，要把我们的要求变为每个企业的职工群众自己的要求，使基层的职工群众完全了解本单位产值和成本的数字，展开班组经济核算和其他基层单位的群众经济核算工作，来为超额完成生产计划、成本计划和利润计划而努力。这就是说，在各企业、各机关、各学校每年要在党组织的领导下有准备地召集一次适当范围的群众大会或群众代表会议来讨论本单位的财务状况和浪费现象，进行广泛的批评和自我批评，提出各种关于增产节约的合理化建议，并通过适当的决议交给主管方面执行。这就是说，要在企业和机关中，逐步推行按月或按季的决算会议或费用检查会议制度，在会议上分析企业的经济活动状况或机关的开支状况，听取参加者的质问、批评、建议，并在上级的主持下作出具体的决议，这样在上下级的监督下来促使各单位的财务工作不断改进，浪费现象不断克服。这就是说，要发动和鼓励群众对各种违反节约原则、违反财政纪律、不执行合理化建议的恶劣现象和贪污盗窃国家财产的罪恶行为，向政府的和党的监察机关告发，向报刊揭露，要把财政工作放在最广大的群众的监督和舆论的监督之下。
    在中共中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，依靠国家机关和人民群众的共同努力，我们相信，我们将逐步消灭目前还存在着的大量浪费现象，逐步形成严格的节约制度，为社会主义建设事业积累充分的资金，从而能够经过几个五年计划，把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的富强的社会主义工业国。到那个时候，人们将进一步认识到，我们今天的艰苦奋斗是完全正确的。
    各位代表！一九五五年的国家预算是国家的利益和人民的意志的反映。人民群众是拥护国家的建设的，是拥护增产节约、反对浪费和贪污的斗争的。政府决心依靠全国人民群众，坚决实现一九五五年的国家预算，坚决展开增产节约、反对浪费和贪污的斗争，保证我国的经济状况和财政状况的不断改进，保证一九五五年国民经济建设计划的完成，并且为我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的顺利完成奠定基础。
