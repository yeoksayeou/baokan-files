Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 26th: U.S. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, advocated for a meeting between the foreign ministers of the United States and the People's Republic of China in a television broadcast on the 24th. George expressed his belief that holding such a meeting is extremely important, and he believes that taking this step would help avoid further deterioration of the situation in the Far East. George advocated that such a meeting should be held in a time "much shorter" than six months.

A reporter asked whether trade issues should be discussed at such a meeting. George replied, "A plan to expand trade is the most realistic and best way to deal with problems in the Far East." He also said, "As long as we have the strange theory that all trade must be prohibited, we are hindering normal relations between the peoples of other countries."

George stated that his advocacy does not mean that the United States should abandon its hostile attitude towards China. He said that talks between the United States and China should not constitute formal recognition of the People's Republic of China. He also said that he still opposes the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations.

    美国参院外交委员会主席乔治
    主张中美两国举行外长级会议
    新华社二十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员乔治二十四日在电视广播中主张美国同中华人民共和国举行外交部长一级的会议。乔治表示相信举行这种会议是极其重要的，他认为采取这种步骤有助于避免远东局势的进一步恶化。乔治主张这种会议应当在今后比六个月“要短得多”的时间内举行。
    有记者问，在这样一个会议上是否应当讨论贸易问题。乔治回答说：“一个扩大贸易的计划是处理远东问题的最现实和最好的途径。”他并且说：“只要我们具有认为一切贸易都必须禁止的稀奇古怪的理论，我们就是在阻碍其他国家人民之间的正常关系。”
    乔治声明，他的这种主张并非意味着美国应该放弃对中国的敌视态度。他说，美国和中国的会谈，不能构成对中华人民共和国的正式承认。他还说他仍然反对中华人民共和国进入联合国。
