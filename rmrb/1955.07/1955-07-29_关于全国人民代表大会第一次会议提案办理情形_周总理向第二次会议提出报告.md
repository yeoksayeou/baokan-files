Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, submitted a written report to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress regarding the handling of proposals from the First Session of the First National People's Congress.

The First Session of the First National People's Congress decided to hand over a total of thirty-nine proposals to the State Council for separate handling in accordance with the review opinions. Among them, proposals that should be and can be handled, some were already planned by the government and have been implemented, and will continue to be implemented in the future; some have been formulated by relevant departments according to needs and possible conditions, with implementation methods. For example, regarding the proposal to eradicate the Yangtze River's problems ahead of schedule, the Ministry of Water Resources has conducted research in conjunction with relevant departments, and the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources is preparing data. The State Council has hired a Soviet expert group to help prepare the Yangtze River Basin plan, and this work will begin soon. The case proposed by the representatives of Fujian Province to advance and accelerate the construction of the Fujian Railway as much as possible to facilitate transportation and support the liberation of Jinmen and Taiwan, in fact, the Yingtan-Xiamen line from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Fujian, started construction in October 1954, and is now under active construction. Regarding the proposal for manufacturing man-made fibers, the situation of the Ministry of Textile Industry's consultation with relevant departments is: At present, using waste cotton as a raw material for trial production of rayon has yielded good results; experiments are now being conducted on using bamboo pulp to make man-made fibers, and preparations are being made to test sugarcane bagasse pulp, rice straw pulp, etc. as raw materials for man-made fibers one by one; during the first Five-Year Plan, preparations are also being made to first build a rayon factory using wood pulp as raw material.

Some of the above-mentioned proposals have been carefully studied by relevant departments under the State Council and are prepared to be implemented gradually. For example, after the Ministry of Higher Education studied the proposal to send more technical graduates to work in grassroots units for training, it believed that it would take a considerable amount of time to formulate practical and feasible methods for using engineering graduates from universities and colleges, and it would need to be jointly studied with various employers (mainly industrial departments) and gradually carried out. At the same time, when formulating the unified distribution plan and allocation plan for university and college graduates for the summer of 1955, the Ministry of Higher Education has paid attention to allocating engineering graduates to grassroots units such as industrial and mining enterprises as much as possible, and roughly more than 80% of the people can be allocated to grassroots production units. Regarding the suggestion in the proposal to cultivate scientific traditional Chinese medicine, after research by relevant departments, it is believed that there are currently certain difficulties in traditional Chinese medicine teachers and teaching materials. It has been decided to first establish a Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute to train teachers who can teach traditional Chinese medicine courses and compile teaching materials in the institute, so as to increase traditional Chinese medicine courses in higher medical colleges and schools and cultivate traditional Chinese medicine talents.

In addition, relevant departments are still continuing to study and handle some of the suggestions made in some proposals. The State Council has made replies to each of the proposals that cannot be implemented immediately due to current limitations in its report.

    关于全国人民代表大会第一次会议提案办理情形
    周总理向第二次会议提出报告
    新华社二十八日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来向第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提出关于第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议提案办理情形的书面报告。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议决定交国务院依照审查意见分别处理的提案共三十九件。其中，凡应当办理而且可以办理的提案，有些是政府早有筹划并已付诸实施的，准备在今后继续贯彻；有些已由各有关部门根据需要和可能的条件，拟出了实施的办法。例如关于提前根治长江的提案，水利部已会同有关部门进行了研究，水利部长江水利委员会正在准备资料，国务院已聘请苏联专家组帮助编制长江流域规划，不久这一工作即将开始。福建省代表提出的尽量提早并加速修筑福建铁路，以利交通运输，支援解放金门、台湾一案，实际上由浙赣路通往福建的鹰潭—厦门线，已于一九五四年十月开工，现正积极修筑。关于制造人造纤维的提案，纺织工业部商同有关部门研究办理的情况是：目前用废棉作为试制人造丝原料，已有良好结果；现正在试验利用竹浆制人造纤维，并准备逐一试验以甘蔗渣浆、稻草浆等作人造纤维原料；在第一个五年计划内，还准备先建设一个以木浆为原料的人造丝厂。
    上述提案中的有些提案已由国务院交有关部门作了周密研究，准备逐步实施。例如高等教育部研究了多派技术毕业生到基层工作单位锻炼这一提案以后，认为制订使用高等学校工科毕业生的切实可行的办法，需要相当的时间同各用人部门（主要是工业部门）共同研究，逐步进行。同时，高等教育部在拟制一九五五年暑期高等学校毕业生的统一分配计划和调配计划时，已注意将工科毕业生尽量分配到工矿企业等基层单位工作，大致有百分之八十以上的人可以分配到基层生产单位。关于提案中建议培养科学化中医问题，经有关部门研究后，认为目前由于中医师资和中医教材都存在一定的困难，已决定先办一中医研究院，在院中培养讲授中医课程的师资和编纂教材的人才，以便在高等医学院、校中增加中医课程，培养中医人才。
    此外，有些提案中所提出的建议，各有关部门还在继续研究办理。有些提案由于目前条件限制还不能立即实行的，国务院在报告中都一一作了答复。
