Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: According to foreign news agencies, French Foreign Minister Pinay, when outlining France's Far East policy in the Senate of the Republic on the 26th, spoke about the issue of establishing relations between France and the People's Republic of China. Pinay said that the French government "has been studying the issue of recognizing the government of the People's Republic of China for a long time, in fact, for several years." He said that the Korean armistice and the Indochina armistice eliminated the obstacles to establishing any form of relationship with the People's China government. "On the other hand, the Taiwan issue shows that without the participation of People's China, the Far East problem is difficult to solve."

Pinay said: "In the current reality, the French government does not intend to hastily change the political status quo, but intends to establish certain contacts with People's China in the economic and cultural fields." He believes that this "will be able to create a basis for the next step of political recognition."

Pinay also said that he believes that if the recognition of New China and the establishment of diplomatic relations with New China are to be effective, it must be jointly decided by Western countries. He said that in this regard, France will consider the attitude of the United States. Pinay expressed his hope that Western countries that have not yet taken this measure will be able to study a "positive solution" to this issue in the near future.

    法国外长谈同我国建立关系问题
    新华社二十八日讯　据外国通讯社报道：法国外交部长比内二十六日在共和国参议院概述法国远东政策时，谈到法国同中华人民共和国之间建立关系的问题。比内说：法国政府“研究承认中华人民共和国政府问题已有很长时间，事实上已有好几年了。”他说：朝鲜停战和印度支那停战消除了同人民中国政府建立任何形式的关系的障碍。而“另一方面，台湾问题表明，如果没有人民中国参加，远东问题是难以解决的。”
    比内说：“在目前的现实情况下，法国政府不打算匆忙地改变政治现状，而打算在经济和文化方面同人民中国建立某些接触。”他认为：这“将能为下一步的政治承认创造基础。”
    比内还说他认为，承认新中国，同新中国建立外交关系这件事如果要成为有效的话，就必须由西方国家共同决定。他说：在这方面，法国将考虑美国的态度。比内表示，希望到现在还没有采取这一措施的西方国家能够在最近期间就这一问题研究一个“积极解决办法”。
