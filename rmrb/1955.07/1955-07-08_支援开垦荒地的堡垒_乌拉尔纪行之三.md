　　Fortress Supporting Wasteland Reclamation
　　— Ural Travelogue (3)
　　By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    In March, the office of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory and the corridor outside were noisy from morning till night. Many young workers went there to apply to reclaim wasteland. Punching worker Boris Yakubov and his wife, punching worker Galia, were called into the office of the League Committee Secretary. People asked, "You've decided to go together, both of you, is that right?" Yakubov replied with a smile, "We've decided to go together, not just the two of us, but the whole family of five." Yakubov was only twenty-eight years old, and he had already worked in the forging workshop of this factory for ten years. He wanted to participate in wasteland reclamation last year, but his youngest son was only one year old. After the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party this year, his wife was the first to propose realizing this common wish. He also wrote to his mother in Leningrad to discuss it. His mother replied:
  "If this is your wish and a rational action, then go! I agree." But Yakubov was a backbone worker in the workshop and had no special skills for the future wasteland. Therefore, on the one hand, he found a capable successor for the workshop, and on the other hand, he participated in a tractor driver training class organized by the factory, and then rushed to the wasteland before spring sowing.
    In 1954, this factory sent 498 volunteers to reclaim wasteland. In March 1955, 700 young workers submitted applications to go to the wasteland for reclamation. But this is not the most important support that the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory gave to wasteland reclamation. The most fundamental support it gave to wasteland reclamation was its mass production of
  "Stalinist-80" tractors and tractor parts.
      The "Stalinist-80" tractor is a post-war, eighty-horsepower, diesel-powered crawler tractor. We are not unfamiliar with them. They guard the entrance of the Mechanization and Electrification Exhibition Hall of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow. They will gallop on the fields of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Farm in Northeast China. They appear in large numbers on the virgin and cultivated wastelands of Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals. This heavy-duty tractor can carry ten to twelve plows when plowing, six to eight seeders when sowing, two or three combines when harvesting, and can plow to a depth of seventy to eighty centimeters when deep plowing with a large plow. Its characteristics are: powerful, high work efficiency, strong, flexible, and economical. I am very happy to see the factory that manufactures this tractor.
    After arriving in Chelyabinsk, I learned that the tractor factory began construction at the end of 1929 and began production on June 1, 1933. As early as 1936, the tractors produced by this factory had exceeded the total output of all tractor factories in the United States. Before the Patriotic War, this factory had supplied agriculture with more than 100,000 tractors. During the Patriotic War, it strongly supported the front with its products. And now, when the Soviet people are further developing heavy industry and agriculture to transition to a communist society, it has become a fortress supporting wasteland reclamation. People in the factory told me that, calculated at fifteen horsepower per tractor, Soviet industry supplied agriculture with 137,000 tractors in 1954, and the output of their factory accounted for more than a quarter of this number.
    At the gate of the factory, there is a large banner with the words: "Produce more tractors and tractor parts for wasteland reclamation!" After arriving at the workshop, it feels that this is not a general slogan, but a program of action for all employees of the factory. They guarantee to complete the Five-Year Plan before December 5th, to increase the output in 1955 by 48% compared to 1950, and to produce 3 million rubles worth of tractor parts more than planned this year.
    I went to the forging, casting, machining, and assembly workshops. Because heavy-duty tractors are manufactured, these workshops are larger than ordinary tractor factory workshops.
    In the forging workshop, a steel ingot heating furnace is followed by a forging press, and large and small heating furnaces and forging presses are densely arranged. The steam hammers are forging tractor parts one after another. There are so many steam hammers and such great forging force that people walking through the workshop feel the vibration of the ground under their feet. Female worker Batielina operates a manipulator, taking out the red-hot steel bar from the heating furnace, sending it under the steam hammer to be hammered several times, and then forging the crankshaft of the tractor.
    During the lunch break, in the red corner of this workshop, I met the advanced forger Filipp Manaev. He transferred from the Kirov Factory in Leningrad to this workshop when the factory started in 1933, and has worked in this workshop for twenty-two years, but he does not look old. He recalled an event from that year and said: "In 1933, an American engineer worked in our workshop. At that time, we manufactured tractor ring chains. The quota for each shift was 180 to 200 pieces, which is insignificant compared to now. We exceeded the quota and manufactured 300 pieces. The American engineer scolded us for manufacturing too much. We ignored him. I created a record of manufacturing 1,000 pieces in one shift."
    Overfulfilling the plan is a common occurrence for Manaev. This is related to his sense of ownership as a member of the working class. He said: "We ourselves are the owners of the factory. If we supply agriculture with more tractors, then agriculture will supply us with more grain, milk, and oil, and we are building a communist society in this way."
    In the casting workshop, almost all the work is mechanized. The steel juice smelted by the electric furnace flows into the steel ladle, and then poured into the sand molds arranged on the conveying device. The workshop is filled with these circulating conveying devices. The majority of those who build the core of the model are female workers.
    The party work in this workshop is done well, which is an important factor in the workshop's outstanding work. Under the leadership of Comrade Prikotkin, the secretary of the factory party committee, I talked with the secretary of the workshop party branch and the party group leader. What is noteworthy here is the importance attached to the work of the most basic link of the party, that is, the party group that is closest to the masses. According to Comrade Lisov, the party group leader, their group has seven people who supervise the production of the work section. Once, the work section lagged behind in molding. They held an open party group meeting, invited advanced foremen to participate, studied the reasons for the backwardness, and decided that each foreman should send a person from his own production team to help. The party group checks the improvement of product quality every month. Soon after, the waste products and the consumption of materials were reduced. Another time, a foreman violated discipline and did not report his work to his superiors. The party group severely dealt with this matter. When violations of discipline occur, they are brought to the party group meeting for discussion. This is very helpful in maintaining good discipline. One of the ways the party group works is to hold five to ten minute meetings in the morning to solve current production problems or arrange publicity work, etc. The party group does not make any resolutions, but it must write a work diary. All party members in the group participate in political study. The party group pays attention to the guidance of the Youth League group. The Youth League group has forty-two Youth League members, who are powerful assistants to the party members.
    In the machining workshop, countless lathes are neatly arranged in the order of flow operation. Many lathes process six or eight parts at the same time. This factory has more than one casting workshop and machining workshop.
    People cannot walk through all the workshops at once, but they can see the semi-finished products of each workshop in the assembly workshop. The engine and various parts of the tractor are assembled layer by layer on the conveying device. Finally, the huge tractor is fitted with tracks, the engine is started, and after the test is qualified, it is lifted by a crane onto the open car of the train, and directly transported from the factory to the place where it is needed.
    These giant tractors are constantly departing to the wasteland reclamation areas and other rural areas, as well as to construction sites and other industrial sites. The "Stalinist-80" tractor can be hung and towed with more than sixty kinds of accessories, and is used in agriculture, construction, petroleum, logging and other industries.
    The Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory not only needs to supply more tractors to these national economic sectors, but also needs to continuously improve the quality of the tractors. In order to improve the quality of the products, the factory held a technical meeting at the end of February with representatives of the departments that use its tractors to exchange opinions. While praising the tractors, the representatives provided many useful opinions. Sidorenko, the chief engineer of the Tractor Station Management Office of the Altai Frontier Agricultural Bureau, proposed: "The technical personnel of the factory and the people who use the tractors should establish closer contact, study the experience, suggestions and requirements of these people more deeply, and see and implement all valuable and advanced opinions more bravely." The connection and cooperation between producers and consumers is a feature of Soviet industry. The employees of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory are not complacent with the honor of producing the largest tractor in the Soviet Union, and humbly listen to the opinions of the society. This will undoubtedly help the factory's production to develop further.

　　支援开垦荒地的堡垒
　　——乌拉尔纪行之三
　　本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    三月间，在车里雅宾斯克拖拉机工厂的列宁共产主义青年团委员会办公室和外面走廊里，从早到晚，人声嘈杂。许多青年工人上那里申请开垦荒地去。冲压工人波里斯·雅库波夫和他的妻子冲压女工加里雅，被叫进团委书记办公室。人们问：“一块决定了两个都去，是吗？”雅库波夫微笑地回答：“一块决定了，不只两个，而是全家五个都去。”雅库波夫才二十八岁，已经在这个工厂的锻压车间工作十年。他去年就想参加开荒，但是小儿子才周岁。今年苏联共产党中央委员会一月全会以后，是他的妻子先提议实现这个共同的愿望。他也写信给在列宁格勒的母亲商量。他的母亲回信说：
  “要是这件事是你们的心愿和理智的行动，去吧！我赞成。”但是雅库波夫在车间是骨干工人，对于未来的荒地却没有专长。因此，他一方面为车间找了一个能干的承继者，另一方面在工厂举办的拖拉机手训练班参加学习，然后才在春天播种以前赶到荒地去。
    这个工厂在一九五四年送了四百九十八个志愿者去开垦荒地。在一九五五年三月，有七百个青年工人递了到荒地去开垦的申请书。但这还不是车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂给开垦荒地的最主要的支援。它给开垦荒地的最基本的支援是它大量生产
  “斯大林工作者—八十”式拖拉机和拖拉机的零件。
      “斯大林工作者—八十”式拖拉机是在战后出产的、八十匹马力的、使用柴油的履带式拖拉机。我们对于它们并不生疏。它们守卫在莫斯科苏联农业展览会的机械化和电气化展览馆的门口。它们将驰骋在我国东北国营友谊农场的田野上。它们大量出现在哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚和乌拉尔的生荒地和熟荒地上。这种重型拖拉机在耕地时能带上十付到十二付犁，在播种时能带上六付到八付播种机，在收割时能带上两三台联合收割机，在犁地时用大头犁能深耕到七、八十公分。它的特点是：力量强大，工作效率高，又结实，又灵活，又经济。我很高兴能看到制造这种拖拉机的工厂。
    到了车里雅宾斯克以后，我知道：拖拉机制造厂是在一九二九年底动工建设，在一九三三年六月一日开始生产的。还在一九三六年，这个工厂出产的拖拉机，已经超过美国全国拖拉机工厂的总产量。在卫国战争以前，这个工厂已经供给农业十万台以上拖拉机。在卫国战争中，它以自己的产品有力地支援了前线。而现在，当苏联人民为过渡到共产主义社会而进一步发展重工业和农业的时候，它又成为支援开垦荒地的堡垒。工厂的人们告诉我：以每台十五匹马力折算，苏联工业在一九五四年供给了农业十三万七千台拖拉机，他们的工厂的产量占这个数目的四分之一以上。
    在工厂的大门口，挂着大字标语：“为开垦荒地生产更多的拖拉机和拖拉机零件！”到车间以后，便觉得这不是泛泛的口号，而是工厂全体职工行动的纲领。他们保证：在十二月五日以前完成五年计划，使一九五五年的产量比一九五○年提高百分之四十八，今年要超计划多生产价值三百万卢布的拖拉机零件。
    我到了锻压、铸造、机械加工和装配四个车间。因为制造的是重型拖拉机，这些车间都比一般的拖拉机工厂车间大。
    在锻压车间，一口钢锭加热炉跟着一台锻压机，密密地排列着大大小小的加热炉和锻压机。此起彼落的汽锤锻压着拖拉机零件。汽锤这么多，锻力这么大，使走过车间的人们感到脚底土地的震动。女工巴捷林娜操纵一台操作机，从加热炉取出火红的钢棒，送到汽锤下锤了几道，便锻出了拖拉机的曲柄轴。
    在午饭休息时间，在这个车间的红角，我见了先进的锻工菲立普·马纳也夫。他从一九三三年工厂开工时候起便从列宁格勒的基洛夫工厂转到这个车间，仅仅在这个车间就工作了二十二年，但不显老。他回忆起当年的一件事说：“在一九三三年，一个美国工程师在我们的车间里工作。那时，我们制造拖拉机的环链。每班定额为一百八十到二百件，比起现在，小得不值一提。我们超过定额，制造了三百件。这位美国工程师骂我们制造得太多。我们不理他。我创造了一班制造一千件的纪录。”
    超额完成计划，在马纳也夫是常事。这和他具有工人阶级的主人翁感觉是有关系的。他说：“我们自己是工厂的主人。要是我们供给农业更多的拖拉机，那么农业会供给我们更多的粮食、牛乳、油脂，我们这样建设着共产主义社会。”
    在铸造车间，几乎全部工作都是机械化的。由电炉炼出的钢汁流进盛钢桶，再浇到排列在输送装置上面的沙型中。车间内布满这些循环转动的输送装置。筑造型心的大部分是女工。
    这个车间的党的工作做得好，是车间工作出色的重要因素。我在工厂党委书记普里霍特金同志带领之下，和车间党支部书记、党小组长谈了话。这里令人注意的是对于党的最基本环节，也就是最接近群众的党小组的工作的重视。据党小组长黎索夫同志说：他们一组有七个人，对工段的生产进行监督。有一次，工段在制模方面落后了。他们举行了公开的党小组会，邀请了先进的工长参加，研究了落后的原因，决定了每个工长由自己的生产组派一个人去帮助。党小组每月检查产品质量改进的情况。不久以后，废品和材料的耗费都减低了。又有一次，一个工长不守纪律，不向上级报告工作。党小组严厉地处理了这件事。遇到违反纪律事情，就拿到党小组会上讨论。这对于保持良好的纪律很有帮助。党小组工作的一个方式是有事时在上午举行五分钟到十分钟的会议，解决当前的生产问题或者布置宣传鼓动工作等等。党小组不作什么决议，但要写工作日记。全组党员都参加政治学习。党小组注意对团小组的指导。团小组有四十二个团员，他们是党员的有力助手。
    在机械加工车间，数不尽的车床按照流水作业的次序整齐地排列着。许多车床同时对六个零件或八个零件加工。这个工厂有不止一个铸造车间和机械加工车间。
    人们一次不可能走遍所有的车间，但是可以在装配车间看到各车间的半成品。发动机和拖拉机的各部分，在输送装置上一层又一层装配起来。最后，巨大的拖拉机穿上了履带，开动发动机，试验合格后，由起重机吊到火车的敞车上，从工厂直接运到需要它们的地方去。
    这些巨型拖拉机川流不息地出发到开荒地区和其他农村去，也出发到建筑工地和其他工业场所去。“斯大林工作者—八十”式拖拉机可以吊挂和牵引六十多种配件，用在农业和建筑、石油、木材采伐等等工业方面。
    车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂不单要供给这些国民经济部门更多的拖拉机，而且要不断地提高拖拉机的质量，为了改进产品的质量，这个工厂在二月底同使用它的拖拉机的部门的代表开了交换意见的技术会议。代表们在称赞拖拉机的同时，提供了许多有益的意见。阿尔泰边疆农业局拖拉机站管理处总工程师西多连科提议：“工厂的技术人员和使用拖拉机的人们要建立更密切的联系，要更深刻地研究这些人们的经验、建议和要求，要更勇敢地看出和实现一切宝贵的先进的意见。”生产者和消费者的联系和合作，是苏联工业的一个特色。车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂职工不自满于自己所出产的苏联最大的拖拉机的荣誉，虚心地听取社会上的意见。这无疑的将帮助工厂的生产进一步的发展。
