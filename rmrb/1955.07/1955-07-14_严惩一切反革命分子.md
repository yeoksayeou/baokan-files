    Severely Punish All Counter-Revolutionaries
    Wang Baozhen
    When the "People's Daily" began to publish articles criticizing Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary and artistic ideology, I still thought that Hu Feng's problem was just an ideological problem and a matter for the literary and artistic circles. But after the People's Daily successively exposed several batches of materials about the counter-revolutionary crimes of Hu Feng and his clique, I realized that the Hu Feng clique was a counter-revolutionary group. I really did not expect that today, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and with the revolutionary strength of the people growing stronger day by day, there would still be such a large counter-revolutionary group. This shows that my political sensitivity is still insufficient, and we have not raised a high degree of vigilance against the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. That is why the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been able to hide in our ranks until now and carry out various vicious conspiracies.
    The three batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have made me clearly recognize the ugly face and reactionary essence of the Hu Feng clique. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not only an ideological problem but also a political problem. The struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not only a matter for the literary and artistic circles but also a major event related to the vital interests of the people of the whole country. Conclusive facts fully confirm that the Hu Feng clique has close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Hu Feng is Chiang's loyal lackey, and the Hu Feng clique is a thorough and insidious counter-revolutionary organization. The Hu Feng clique, under the guise of Marxism-Leninism, carried out "heart-digging warfare," opposed the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, hated the people's regime, opposed the people's revolutionary cause, and attempted to subvert the new Chinese regime and restore the reactionary ruling class. The heinous acts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are intolerable to us. I, along with the people of the whole country, resolutely demand that the people's government severely punish these counter-revolutionary elements according to the law.
    What I originally found very strange was: why couldn't the Hu Feng clique, having been in the revolutionary camp for many years, recognize the revolution? Why couldn't they raise their political awareness? Why did they insist on taking the counter-revolutionary road? I now understand that they are counter-revolutionary elements who have been hiding in the revolutionary camp for a long time and are not participating in the revolution at all, so there is no question of raising their political awareness. Hu Feng has always adhered to the reactionary bourgeois idealist world view. First, Hu Feng opposed the communist world view and advocated "subjective fighting spirit," which is to oppose materialism. Second, Hu Feng opposed literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed the socialist bright and beautiful future, and "hated" the modern "social order." Third, Hu Feng opposed ideological remolding in literary and artistic circles, attempting to allow reactionary bourgeois idealist ideas to continue to dominate the minds of intellectuals and the masses and opposed intellectuals taking the road of socialist revolution. This is against the will of the people of the whole country and is extremely insidious and vicious. These three points alone can explain that their political crimes are unforgivable. Moreover, they even more viciously carried out despicable conspiracies!
    We must learn from this serious incident, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, use the theoretical weapon of dialectical materialism to shatter the bastion of reactionary idealism, raise our political acumen, raise our revolutionary vigilance, raise our ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, strengthen unity, actively assist the government in eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements, so as to purify the people's democratic united front organization and ensure the complete victory of the socialist construction cause of our great motherland.

    严惩一切反革命分子
    王葆真
    当“人民日报”开始发表批判胡风反马克思主义文艺思想的文章的时候，我还认为胡风的问题只不过是思想问题，是文艺界的事情；及至人民日报一连揭露了胡风及其集团的几批反革命罪行材料之后，我才认识到胡风集团是一个反革命集团。我真想不到今天在伟大的中国共产党领导下，在人民革命力量日渐强大的情况下，还有这样大的反革命集团。这说明了我的政治敏感性还不足，我们对反革命分子的活动还没有提起高度的警惕，所以胡风反革命集团才能在我们的队伍中潜藏到现在，并进行着各种恶毒的阴谋活动。
   “人民日报”揭发的胡风反革命集团的三批材料，使我清楚地认识到胡风集团的丑恶面貌及其反动本质。胡风反革命集团不仅是思想问题，而且是政治问题。同胡风反革命集团的斗争，不仅是文艺界的事，而且是关系全国人民切身利益的大事。确凿的事实完全可以肯定胡风集团是同蒋介石卖国集团有着密切联系的，胡风是蒋贼的忠实走狗，胡风集团是彻头彻尾的毒辣阴险的反革命组织。胡风集团披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，进行“挖心战”，反对中国共产党的领导，反对毛主席的文艺思想，仇视人民政权，反对人民的革命事业，企图颠覆新中国的政权，使反动的统治阶级复辟。胡风反革命集团的罪恶行为，是我们所不能容忍的。我和全国人民一道坚决要求人民政府依法严惩这些反革命分子。
    我原来很觉奇怪的是：胡风集团在革命阵营多年，为什么不能认识革命？不能提高政治觉悟呢？为什么偏要走反革命的道路呢？我现在才明白他们是长期隐藏在革命阵营中的反革命分子，根本不是什么参加革命，当然也就谈不到什么提高政治觉悟。胡风一贯坚持着反动的资产阶级唯心主义的世界观。一、胡风反对共产主义的世界观，而主张“主观战斗精神”，也就是反对唯物主义。二、胡风反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对社会主义光明、美好的前途，而“憎恨”现代的“社会秩序”。三、胡风反对文艺界进行思想改造，企图使反动的资产阶级唯心主义思想继续统治知识分子和人民群众的头脑，反对知识分子走社会主义革命的道路。这是违反全国人民意志的事，是极端阴险毒辣的。由此三点即可说明他们政治上的犯罪是不能饶恕的。何况他们更恶毒地进行了卑鄙的阴谋活动呢！
    我们必须从这一严重事件中吸取教训，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，以辩证唯物主义的理论武器击碎反动的唯心主义的堡垒，提高政治嗅觉，提高革命警惕性，提高辨别反革命分子的能力，分清敌我，加强团结，积极协助政府肃清一切反革命分子，以纯洁人民民主统一战线组织，保证我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业的完全胜利。（原载“河北日报”）
