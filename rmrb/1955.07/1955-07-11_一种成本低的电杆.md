    A new type of mixed-structure electric pole, using a wooden pole body and reinforced concrete pile supports, designed in China, has been used for the first time on the Wu (hu) - Tao (chong) high-voltage transmission line project. The soil along this transmission line is mostly collapsible loess and quicksand. Based on these characteristics, the designers adopted advanced Soviet experience and designed a mixed-structure electric pole with a wooden pole body and reinforced concrete pile supports. This type of electric pole is more convenient to transport than reinforced concrete poles. It can be lengthened or shortened according to the needs of the geographical conditions. This type of electric pole is strong and durable, and generally only requires a single pole. The cost per kilometer of electric poles is 1,500 yuan less than that of pure wooden poles. In the past, the pole towers used on high-voltage transmission lines in China were only made of wood, reinforced concrete, and steel. This is the first time in China that a mixed-structure electric pole with a wooden pole body and reinforced concrete pile supports has been used on a transmission line. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一种成本低的电杆
    我国新设计的木质杆身和钢筋混凝土桩支座混合结构的电杆，第一次在芜（湖）桃（冲）高压输电线路工程上应用。这条输电线路经过的地方，土壤大都是塌土和流沙土。设计人员根据这些特点，采用苏联先进经验，设计出了木质杆身和钢筋混凝土桩支座混合结构的电杆。这种电杆比钢筋混凝土电杆运输便利。它根据地理条件的需要，可以伸长或缩短。这种电杆坚固耐用，一般只用单杆就行。每公里用的电杆的造价比纯木杆可节省一千五百元。过去，我国在高压输电线路上所使用的杆塔，只有木质的、钢筋混凝土的和钢铁的三种。在输电线路使用木质杆身和钢筋混凝土桩支座混合结构的电杆，在我国还是第一次。　（新华社）
