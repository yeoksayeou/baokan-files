Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 14th: At a time when the provocative attacks by the Royal Lao Government forces against the Lao Fighting Units have reached a new climax, news has emerged of further plans by the Manila Treaty Group to interfere in Indochina. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) from Bangkok, a "senior diplomat" in Bangkok revealed on the 12th that the military advisors of the Manila Treaty Organization countries, at a secret meeting held in Bangkok from July 6th to 8th, discussed the issue of Indochina and "adopted specific measures against the communists." This person said that the military advisors "carefully studied the situation in Laos." He also indicated that Thailand "is ready" to intervene in Laos under the pretext of "communist aggression."

At the same time, according to AFP, a spokesperson for the Lao Embassy in Thailand said on the 13th that Laos and Thailand have been "in discussions" regarding Thailand providing "military assistance." The spokesperson indicated that Laos will "request military assistance from Thailand" under the pretext of the Lao Fighting Units "attacking" the Royal Lao Government forces.

These reports indicate that the participants in the Manila Treaty are attempting to exploit the current conflict provoked in Laos to further undermine the peace in Indochina and the Geneva Accords.

    马尼拉条约组织军事顾问会议
    曾策划干涉印度支那问题
    新华社河内十四日电　在老挝王国政府军队向寮国战斗部队的挑衅性进攻到达新的高潮的时候，又传来了马尼拉条约集团进一步策划干涉印度支那的消息。据法新社从曼谷报道，曼谷的一个“高级外交人士”十二日透露，马尼拉条约组织各国军事顾问七月六日到八日在曼谷举行的秘密会议上，曾讨论了印度支那的问题，并且“通过了反对共产党的具体措施”。这个人说，军事顾问们“仔细地研究了老挝的局势”。他还表示，泰国“已经准备好”在“共产党侵略”的借口下，对老挝进行干涉。
    同时，据法新社报道，老挝驻泰国公使馆的一个发言人十三日说，老挝和泰国已经就泰国提供“军事援助”的问题“进行讨论”。发言人表示，老挝将在寮国战斗部队“进攻”老挝王国军队的借口下，“要求泰国给予军事援助”。
    这些消息表明，马尼拉条约的参加者正在企图利用目前在老挝挑起的冲突进一步破坏印度支那的和平和日内瓦协定。
