Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: Saigon Dispatch: Ngo Dinh Diem, on the 16th, made a statement via radio broadcast regarding the Vietnamese general election.

    In his statement, he pretended to "not oppose" the principle of free general elections, but then proceeded to slander the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to use this as a pretext to refuse negotiations and oppose holding general elections. In his statement, he also emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities are "in no way bound by the (Geneva) Accords."

    Agence France-Presse reported that Saigon political figures believe that Ngo Dinh Diem's statement is "clearly an act of rejecting the Geneva Accords." Reuters also quoted an "authoritative source" on Ngo Dinh Diem's side as saying that Ngo Dinh Diem's statement means "a straightforward rejection" of negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    吴庭艳就越南普选问题发表声明
    叫嚣不受日内瓦协定的约束
    新华社河内十七日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳在十六日通过电台广播，发表了关于越南普选问题的声明。
    他在声明中装作“不反对”自由普选的原则，可是，他接着就颠倒黑白地诬蔑越南民主共和国政府，企图借此拒绝进行协商，反对举行普选。他在声明中还强调越南南方当局“丝毫不受（日内瓦）协定的约束”。
    法新社消息指出，西贡政界人士认为，吴庭艳的声明“显然是拒绝日内瓦协定的行动”。路透社还引述吴庭艳方面的“权威人士”的谈话说，吴庭艳的声明意味着“直截了当地拒绝”同越南民主共和国政府进行协商。
