　　Shouldn't this kind of waste be opposed?
    Editor:
    At the end of May, the Linxi Coal Washing Plant of Kailuan Coal Mine transported a batch of high-quality, beautiful furniture, including spring mattresses, full-length mirror wardrobes, round tables, bookshelves, etc. These items were custom-made for the plant's director, deputy director, section chiefs, and deputy section chiefs. The cost of materials and labor was approximately 1,200 yuan, which was paid from the enterprise's operating and management expenses.
    Originally, in November 1954, the Administrative Office of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office issued interim measures regarding the borrowing of furniture. The director of the Coal Washing Plant, Li Zhengqing, decided to order this batch of high-quality furniture. The steel springs for the spring mattresses were "utilized" from the plant's old steel cables, and the general affairs department arranged manpower to make them specifically. Initially, it was decided to make 4,000, but due to busy production tasks, 2,200 were made, and finally only 700 were used, leaving 1,500 unused.
    The distribution of this furniture was carried out secretly. The plant director, deputy director, and party branch secretary each received a double spring mattress, a full-length mirror wardrobe, a round table, and a bookshelf. Section chiefs and deputy section chiefs received a single spring mattress, a round table, etc. All leading staff members in the plant were very happy and moved the furniture back home.
    The plant director certainly took good care of himself and other leading staff members' lives, but the attitude towards workers was different. This plant has nearly a hundred female workers with only one small bathhouse, and they all have to queue to take a bath. The male workers also lack lockers, and workers can only put their dry food and shoes and socks together when they come to work. Regarding these issues, the plant director always said:
  "There is no money and no manpower, and it cannot be resolved for the time being." But for the furniture of the leading staff, there was money and manpower.
    Recently, this matter was exposed, and someone suggested that this extravagant waste phenomenon be displayed at the "Anti-Waste Exhibition." Comrade Wang Wen, the party branch secretary, said: "Anti-waste should focus on the big picture, these are small things." May I ask, doesn't this so-called small thing precisely illustrate the leading staff members' ideas of seeking enjoyment and benefiting themselves at the expense of the public? Shouldn't this kind of waste be opposed?

### 难道这样的浪费就不用反对吗？

　　难道这样的浪费就不用反对吗？编辑同志：
    五月底，开滦煤矿林西洗煤厂运来了一批上等漂亮的家具，其中有弹簧软床、穿衣镜立柜、方圆桌、书架等。这些东西是为厂里的正副厂长，正副科长们订做的。工料款约一千二百元，在企业经营管理费项下开支。
    原来在一九五四年十一月，开滦煤矿总管理处行政处发下了有关借用家具的暂行办法。洗煤厂厂长李正卿就决定订做这批上等的家具。其中弹簧床的钢丝弹簧，是“利用”厂里的旧钢丝绳、由总务部门安排人工专门做的；开始决定做四千个，由于生产任务忙，做了二千二百个，最后只用了七百个，还剩下一千五百个。
    这批家具的分配是秘密进行的。厂长、副厂长、党总支书记每人分到了双人弹簧软床一张、穿衣镜立柜一个、方圆桌一个、书架一个；正副科长分到了单人弹簧软床、方圆桌等。厂里所有领导工作人员皆大欢喜，把家具搬回去。
    厂长对自己和其他领导工作人员的生活照顾得的确很周到，但是对待工人态度就不一样了。这个厂里近百名女工只有一个小澡池，洗澡都得排队；男工人的更衣箱也很缺，工人们来上班时只能把干粮和鞋袜放在一起。对于这些问题，厂长总是说：
  “没有钱，又没有工力，一时不能解决。”但是为了领导工作人员的家具，钱就有了，工力就有了。
    最近，这件事被人揭发了，有人建议把这种铺张浪费现象拿到“反浪费展览会”上去展览。党总支书记王文同志说：“反浪费应该从大处着眼，这些是小事情。”请问，这件所谓小事情，难道不正是说明领导工作人员们贪图享受、损公利己的思想吗？难道这样的浪费就不用反对吗？
