    The reason why our country was able to restore the national economy, which had been destroyed by long-term war, in a short period of three years and rapidly carry out planned economic construction is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union. Our country is economically backward, its resource situation is unclear, its technical level is very low, and it lacks experience in economic construction, so it is inevitable that we will encounter many difficulties in economic construction. However, our current socialist construction has much more favorable conditions than the Soviet Union did in those years. The Soviet Union once built a socialist society in capitalist encirclement all by itself, while we have the huge selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, which is carrying out communist construction and has the most advanced economic development and science and technology, as well as the fraternal assistance of other People's Democratic countries. This international favorable condition is of great significance to our country's socialist construction. We are deeply convinced that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, with the arduous struggle of the people of the whole country and the continued assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties, victoriously achieve the first Five-Year Plan, and gradually build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    As everyone knows, the center of the first Five-Year Plan is industrial construction, and the center of industrial construction is the construction of 156 industrial units with Soviet assistance. These enterprises, including modern joint enterprises, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mining enterprises, petroleum enterprises, various heavy machinery manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, power stations, chemical plants, etc., are extremely important for our country's socialist industrialization. After these enterprises are completed, our country will have twice or several times more electric power industry, coal mining industry, and petroleum industry than it does now, will have a modern iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and basic chemical industry, and will be able to manufacture many metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, mining equipment, oil extraction equipment, aircraft, automobiles, and tractors, etc., which our country has never manufactured in its history. In this way, a preliminary foundation will be laid for our country's socialist industrialization, and our country's economic strength and national defense strength will be greatly enhanced.

    The Soviet Union provides comprehensive and systematic assistance to our country in the construction of these 156 industrial units, from surveying geology, selecting factory sites, collecting basic design data, conducting design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and starting work, and supplying technical data for new products, all the way to manufacturing new finished products. The construction of these units is proceeding smoothly according to the established plan. As of the end of 1954, 19 enterprises had been partially completed or had been completed and put into operation, including large enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, sheet metal plant, and Haizhou open-pit coal mine. The designs supplied by the Soviet Union widely adopt the latest technological achievements. The equipment supplied by the Soviet Union is first-class and the most modern. These 156 construction units are all large in scale, so designing these factories and supplying equipment is not an easy task. For example, the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant designed by the Soviet Union for us, in addition to a large number of preliminary designs and technical designs, have more than 20,000 construction drawings alone. If these construction drawings are laid out, its area is more than 18 mu, and if these construction drawings are connected, they are 24 li long; at the same time, the Soviet Union also organized dozens of large factories to manufacture various automated equipment for the two plants and Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 7 blast furnace, which could fill more than 5,000 train cars. From government leaders to design workers and equipment manufacturing workers, the Soviet Union is assisting our country's construction with great enthusiasm and a serious and responsible spirit. For example, due to our country's unclear resource situation, insufficient technical strength, and lack of experience, we had some difficulties and problems in selecting factory sites, determining product plans, and distributing various units. However, with the specific help of the Soviet Union, they were all satisfactorily resolved. The chief engineer of a certain Soviet design institute once said: "All the staff of our design institute are completing the design with great enthusiasm. Everyone believes that assisting China's construction is a glorious task, and we will do our best to deliver the design ahead of schedule." The workshop of the famous Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant hangs such an enthusiastic slogan: "Complete the equipment manufacturing task for fraternal China ahead of schedule." In order to rush the machinery and electrical equipment for the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, workers in dozens of metallurgical, machinery, electrical, and tool manufacturing plants in large cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kharkov, and Kiev launched a warm socialist labor competition.

    In the past few years, at the invitation of our government, the Soviet Union has drawn a large number of experts from their busy communist construction to help us in our country. They not only have high scientific and technological knowledge and rich work experience, but also have a high spirit of internationalism and a selfless work attitude. They regard our country's great cause of building socialism as their own. They introduce the Soviet Union's superb technology and rich advanced experience to various departments and employees in our country without reservation, and have made outstanding contributions to our country's work in industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, railways, transportation, posts and telecommunications, construction, education, health, and other aspects. They have also helped us train a large number of talents who have mastered advanced technology. For example, during the period when China and the Soviet Union jointly managed the Chinese Changchun Railway, Soviet experts trained more than 20,000 management personnel and technical personnel for our country's railway construction. In the three years since the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Joint Shipbuilding Company, with the help of Soviet experts, thousands of technical and management cadres above the work section level have grown up. In the four years since the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Joint Non-Ferrous Metals Company, under the guidance of Soviet experts, a strong technical team of thousands of people has been cultivated. These technical cadres and technicians are responsible for work in hundreds of technical work positions. In short, wherever there are Soviet experts, a large number of new-type technical personnel are trained. This is very important in our country, which is technically backward and lacks talents. In addition, the Soviet Union accepts a large number of students and interns sent by our country to study in the Soviet Union, which is also very important for us to master industrial technology, ensure the start of production of newly built industries, and improve our scientific and technological level.

    Last year, the Soviet Union signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement with our country, further strengthening the Soviet Union's technical assistance to our country, thereby further helping to solve the technical difficulties in our country's economic construction, strengthen our country's scientific and technological strength, and improve our country's scientific and technological level. For example, the Soviet Union provided our country with a large amount of the most advanced technical data and drawings free of charge, helping us to manufacture many new products that could not be manufactured in the past, solved many technical difficulties, and improved the level of basic construction. This year, the Soviet Union also signed an agreement with our country on the peaceful use of atomic energy, providing our country with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, so that our country will be able to start construction for the peaceful use of atomic energy in a short period of five years to serve the development of the national economy.

    Sino-Soviet trade is based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance and cooperation, and has a huge promoting effect on the common development of each other's economies. Through trade, the Soviet Union's assistance to us is very great. In the past few years, in addition to importing many complete sets of equipment from the Soviet Union, our country has also imported a large number of various machines and important materials that cannot be produced domestically or are not produced enough. Such as machine tools, various construction machinery, various steel products, rare metals, telecommunications and electrical equipment, precision instruments, medical equipment, petroleum, chemical raw materials, etc. Most of these materials are so-called embargoed materials by US imperialism. Many of our country's agricultural and sideline products have also found broad and reliable sales channels in the Soviet Union. This has made the US imperialism's sinister conspiracy to obstruct our country's economic recovery and development through the so-called embargo and blockade suffer a shameful defeat. In each year's trade negotiations, the Soviet Union always does its best to supply the materials we need to import and accept the materials we need to export. For example, this year our country's petroleum demand is greater than last year, and our petroleum orders to the Soviet Union have increased a lot compared to last year, and the Soviet Union has tried its best to meet our order requirements. For another example, this year we proposed to the Soviet Union to order thick steel plates for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The width and length exceeded the Soviet production standards. If the original design is changed, a large amount of money will be required. In order for us not to change the original design, the Soviet Union decided to change the production equipment in their workshop to meet our order requirements. On the export side, this year there are some commodities that we have a large production capacity and need to promote sales abroad, and the Soviet Union also tries its best to accept them. The machinery and equipment supplied by the Soviet Union are not only of good quality, but also cheaper than the same things in capitalist countries. The trade prices between China and the Soviet Union have been stable for several years and are not affected by fluctuations in capitalist market prices, which is very helpful for the smooth development of our country's industrial construction and production.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has also given our country significant financial assistance, providing us with loans on preferential terms. These loans are mainly used for the supply of complete sets of equipment and industrial equipment, which is of great significance for promoting our country's socialist industrialization.

    It can be seen from this that the Soviet Union's assistance has played an extremely important role in our country's current construction, which is of such a large scale, at such a fast speed, and at such a high technical level. In particular, the Soviet Union's rich experience in more than 30 years of great socialist and communist construction has played and is playing a very important enlightening role in the drafting and implementation of our country's first Five-Year Plan, enabling our country to avoid many mistakes and take fewer detours in the process of economic construction.

    The Eastern European People's Democratic countries have also provided a lot of economic and technical assistance to our country's economic construction. Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and other People's Democratic countries will supply our country with dozens of complete sets of equipment during our country's Five-Year Plan period and after 1957, including complete sets of equipment for power generation, chemical industry, mining, textile, sugar making, and film processing, which will also be of considerable help to the development of our country's industrialization. The trade between our country and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries also plays a role of mutual assistance and cooperation in the economy. Several fraternal countries in Eastern Europe have also sent many experts to our country to help us carry out economic construction. Our country has signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements with all the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Our country also has close economic cooperation with the Asian People's Democratic countries.

    The struggle of the heroic Korean people and the heroic Vietnamese people for the independence and freedom of their motherland occupies an important position in the world's peace and democracy movement. They have made important contributions to peace in the Far East and the world. Their struggle is also of great significance to our country's economic construction.

    We sincerely thank the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries for their assistance, especially the Soviet Union's great, long-term, comprehensive, and selfless assistance. This assistance embodies the lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries and the unbreakable and extremely deep friendship between us. This assistance plays a significant role in accelerating our country's socialist construction. This assistance is built on the basis of true equality and mutual respect for national interests. This assistance is unprecedented and can only exist in the socialist international family, and is absolutely impossible in the capitalist camp. We have fully verified from our own experience a passage said by Stalin: "No capitalist country can give the People's Democratic countries genuine help and technically sophisticated help like the Soviet Union. The question is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The question is first of all that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic prosperity." Therefore, we should further consolidate and strengthen the economic alliance and friendly cooperation with the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and should better learn from the Soviet Union and the fraternal countries, give play to this international favorable condition, so as to fully realize our country's Five-Year Plan and promote the common economic prosperity of the countries of the socialist camp and enhance the world's peace and democracy forces.

    苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的援助是实现五年计划的有利条件
    对外贸易部副部长  李哲人
    我国所以能够在短短的三年时间，就恢复了被长期战争破坏的国民经济，并迅速地进行有计划的经济建设，这是同苏联和各人民民主国家的援助特别是苏联的援助分不开的。我国经济落后，资源情况不清，技术水平很低，并且缺乏经济建设的经验，因而在经济建设中不可避免地会遇到许多困难。但是，我们现在的社会主义建设比之当年苏联的条件有利得多。苏联曾经单独一个国家在资本主义包围中建成社会主义社会，而我们有着正在进行共产主义建设的、经济发展和科学技术水平最先进的苏联的巨大无私的援助，以及其他各人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助。这个国际有利条件，对我国社会主义建设的意义是十分重大的。我们深信：在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，在全国人民的艰苦奋斗以及苏联和各人民民主国家的继续帮助下，我们一定能够克服一切困难，胜利地实现第一个五年计划，并逐步建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    大家知道，第一个五年建设计划的中心是工业建设，而工业建设的中心是在苏联援助下的一百五十六个工业单位的建设。这些企业，包括现代化的联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿企业、石油企业、各种重型机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、飞机制造厂、电力站、化学工厂等，对于我国社会主义工业化，具有极重要的作用。在这些企业建成后，我国将有比现在大一倍至几倍的电力工业、煤矿工业和石油工业，将有现代化的钢铁工业、有色金属工业和基本化学工业，将能够制造我国历史上从来没有制造过的许多冶金设备、发电设备、矿山设备、采油设备、飞机、汽车和拖拉机等。这样，就为我国社会主义工业化打下初步基础，就会大大增强我国经济力量和国防力量。
    苏联对我国这一百五十六个工业单位的建设，从勘察地质，选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，进行设计，供应设备，指导建筑安装和开工，供应新产品的技术资料，一直到制成新成品，都从头到尾全面地系统地给予援助。这些单位的建设正在按照既定计划顺利地进行着。截至一九五四年底，部分建成或已经建成开工生产者有十九个企业，其中包括鞍钢的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、薄板厂，海州露天煤矿等大企业。苏联供应的设计，广泛地采用最新的技术成就。苏联供应的设备，都是第一流的，最新式的。这一百五十六个建设单位都是规模巨大的，因此设计这些工厂和供应设备并不是一件轻而易举的事。例如苏联为我们设计的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，除很大数量的初步设计和技术设计以外，只是施工图纸就有二万多张，如果把这些施工图摆开，它的面积有十八亩多，如果把这些施工图连起来，有二十四里长；同时苏联还组织了数十个大工厂为该两厂和鞍钢七号炼铁炉制造了可装满五千多火车皮的各种自动化设备。苏联从政府负责人，到设计工作者和设备制造工人都是以高度热情和严肃负责的精神援助我国建设的。例如，由于我国资源情况不明、技术力量不足、经验缺乏，因而我们对某些工业单位厂址的选择，产品方案的确定和各单位的地区分布曾有过若干困难和问题，但在苏联的具体帮助下都得到圆满解决。苏联某设计院的总工程师曾说：“我们设计院的全体工作人员都在以极大的热情来完成设计，大家都认为援助中国建设是一个光荣的任务，我们将全力使设计能提前交付。”有名的乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的车间中悬挂着这样热情的标语：“为兄弟的中国提前完成设备制造任务。”为着赶制鞍钢三大工程的机械和电气设备，莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维尔德洛夫斯克、哈尔科夫、基辅等大城市的数十个冶金、机械、电气、工具等制造厂的工人，曾展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。
    几年来，苏联应我国政府的邀请，从繁忙的共产主义建设中抽出了大批的专家来我国帮助我们。他们不仅有高度的科学技术知识和丰富的工作经验，而且都具有高度的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动态度。他们把我国建设社会主义的伟大事业当作他们自己的事业一样看待。他们将苏联精湛的技术和丰富的先进经验毫无保留地介绍给我国各部门和职工，在我国工业、农业、林业、水利、铁路、交通、邮电、建筑、教育、卫生以及其他各方面的工作中都作出了卓越的贡献。他们还帮助我们培养了大批掌握先进技术的人材。例如，在中苏两国共管中国长春铁路时期，苏联专家就为我国铁路建设培养了二万多名管理人员和技术人员。在中苏合营造船公司成立的三年中，由于苏联专家的帮助，数以千计的工段以上的技术和管理干部成长起来。中苏合营有色金属公司成立的四年中，在苏联专家的教导下，培养起一支数千人的强大的技术队伍，这些技术干部和技术工人，在数百种技术工作的岗位上担负着工作。总之，哪里有苏联专家，哪里就有大批新型的技术人员被培养出来。这在我国技术落后、人材缺少的情况下有着非常重要的意义。此外，苏联接受我国派往苏联学习的大量的留学生和实习生，这对我们掌握工业技术、保证新建工业的开工生产以及提高我们的科学技术水平，也有十分重要的意义。
    去年苏联同我国签订了科学技术合作协定，进一步加强了苏联对我国的技术帮助，从而更加有助于解决我国经济建设中的技术困难，壮大我国的科学技术力量，提高我国的科学技术水平。例如苏联无偿地供给了我国大量的最先进的技术资料图纸，帮助我们能够制成许多过去不能制造的新产品，解决了许多技术上的困难，并提高了基本建设的水平。苏联今年还同我国签订了和平使用原子能的协定，在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予我国科学、技术和工业上的帮助，使我国将在短短的五年内就能开始和平利用原子能的建设，为发展国民经济服务。
    中苏贸易是建立在平等互利和互助合作的基础上的，对彼此经济的共同发展有着巨大的促进作用。通过贸易，苏联对我们的帮助是很大的。几年来，我国从苏联除进口了许多成套设备外，还进口了大量的国内还不能生产或生产不足的各种机器和重要物资。如工作母机，各种建筑机械，各种钢材，稀有金属，电讯电工器材，精密仪器，医药器材，石油，化工原料等。这些物资，绝大部分是美帝国主义所谓禁运物资。我国许多的农业及其副业产品也在苏联找到了广阔可靠的销路。这就使美帝国主义通过所谓禁运封锁来阻挠我国经济恢复和发展的罪恶阴谋遭受了可耻的失败。在每年贸易谈判中，苏联总是尽最大可能来供应我们需要进口的物资和接受我们需要出口的物资。例如，今年我国石油需要量比去年增大，向苏联的石油订货比去年增加很多，苏联尽可能满足了我们的订货要求。又如今年我们向苏联提出订购建造武汉长江大桥用的厚钢板，宽度、长度超过苏联的生产标准。如果改变原来的设计，需用很大一笔费用。苏联为了我们不改变原来的设计，决定改变他们车间的生产设备，满足了我们的订货要求。在出口方面，今年有一部分商品我们生产能力大，需要向外推销，苏联也尽量予以接受。苏联供应的机械、器材，不仅质量好，而且比资本主义国家的同样的东西便宜。中苏两国贸易价格几年来一直是稳定的，不受资本主义市场价格波动的影响，这对我国工业建设和生产的顺利发展很有帮助。
    大家知道，苏联还给了我国重大的财政援助，以优惠的条件贷款给我们。这些贷款，主要是用于成套设备和工业器材的供应上的，对促进我国社会主义工业化有很大作用。
    由此可见，我国现在的建设所以能够有这样大的规模，有这样快的速度，有这样高的技术水平，苏联的援助是起了极其重大的作用。尤其是苏联三十多年来的伟大的社会主义和共产主义建设的丰富经验，对我国第一个五年计划的草拟和实现，起了和起着十分重要的启示作用，使我国能够在经济建设过程中避免许多错误和少走许多弯路。
    东欧各人民民主国家在经济上技术上也对我国经济建设有不少援助。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、匈牙利等人民民主国家，在我国五年计划期间和一九五七年以后，要分别供应我国数十项成套设备，其中包括发电、化工、采矿、纺织、制糖、电影洗印等成套设备，对我国工业化的发展也有相当的帮助。我国同东欧各人民民主国家的贸易在经济上也起着互助合作的作用。东欧若干兄弟国家也抽出了不少专家来我国帮助我们进行经济建设。我国同东欧各人民民主国家都签订了科学技术合作协定。我国同亚洲各人民民主国家也有着经济上的密切合作。
    英雄的朝鲜人民和英雄的越南人民争取祖国的独立和自由的斗争，在全世界和平民主运动中占有重要的地位。他们对远东和世界和平作出了重要的贡献。他们的斗争，对于我国的经济建设事业也有着巨大意义。
    我们衷心感谢苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，特别是苏联伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助。这种援助，体现了苏联和各人民民主国家的崇高的国际主义精神和我们之间牢不可破的无比深厚的友谊。这种援助，对加速我国社会主义建设起着重大作用。这种援助，是建筑在真正平等和相互尊重国家利益的基础上的。这种援助，是史无前例的，只有在社会主义国际大家庭里才能够有，而在资本主义阵营里是绝不可能有的。我们从切身的经验完全证实斯大林所说过的一段话：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”因此，我们应当进一步地巩固和加强同以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各国的经济联盟和友好合作，应当更好地向苏联和各兄弟国家学习，发挥这个国际有利条件，以全部实现我国的五年计划，并促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨，增强世界和平民主力量。
