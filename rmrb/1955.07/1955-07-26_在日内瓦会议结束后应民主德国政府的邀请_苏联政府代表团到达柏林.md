Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: According to TASS, Berlin, July 24th: The Soviet government delegation, including Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Nikita Khrushchev, arrived in Berlin on the 24th from Geneva at the invitation of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Welcoming the Soviet government delegation at Schönefeld Airport were: German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, German Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lothar Bolz, and other senior government officials, members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and secretaries of the Central Committee, leaders of various democratic parties, mass organizations, and social groups, as well as representatives from Berlin's enterprises, institutions, and schools.

Also present to welcome the Soviet government delegation were Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic Georgy Pushkin, Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, Soviet Marshal Andrei Grechko, senior officials of the Soviet Embassy, representatives of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, and personnel from various foreign diplomatic missions.

Grotewohl delivered a welcoming speech at the airport. He said: "Last week, people around the world, including the German people, were closely watching Geneva. Thanks to the constructive proposals made by the Soviet Union regarding ensuring the security of all countries, disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and resolving the German question, the Geneva talks have generally eased international tensions. It is now clear that the unwavering peace policy of the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp and their willingness to understand each other have had a decisive impact on the development of the international situation. The negotiations in Geneva on ending the Cold War have shown that people around the world oppose the policy of strength and favor international mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence. Germany and the German people have gained new hope for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their homeland. If the four countries in Geneva were able to ease tensions, then the Germans in the two parts of Germany must do the same: reach an agreement on the German question. This is an important conclusion we Germans have drawn from the work of the Geneva Conference."

Bulganin then made a speech. He said: "We have come to you from Geneva, where the summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France has just ended. The Geneva Conference will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the international situation.

The decisions made at the conference and the final statements of the heads of government summarizing the results of the conference have been published. These documents illustrate the positive results of the conference's work."

Bulganin said: "On the German question, the conference reached a unanimously agreed decision. The general meaning of this decision is that the resolution of the German question and the reunification of Germany through free elections must be realized in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. However, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that two different attitudes towards the solution of the German question were manifested at the conference."

Bulganin said: "The delegations of the three Western powers insisted that West Germany, which is being remilitarized, and the unified Germany in the future must become members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European military alliance according to the Paris Agreements, that is, become members of the Western military bloc. Everyone knows that the Soviet government has stated more than once that the inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European military alliance and West Germany's acceptance of the terms of the Paris Agreements preclude the possibility of unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Therefore, the Soviet delegation advocated unifying Germany through another path. We believe that first of all, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the unified Germany in the future, should become part of the pan-European collective security system and should participate in the European Security Treaty. This treaty must guarantee peace and not lead to the revival of militarism, which means immense war terror and suffering for the people."

Bulganin said: "The Soviet delegation also believes that the German question cannot be resolved if the current reality in Germany is not taken into account. In the ten years since the end of World War II, two sovereign states have been formed on the territory of Germany—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. These two countries each have their own economic and social systems. Their respective sovereignty is recognized by other countries. This means that the question of unifying Germany cannot be resolved without considering the opinions of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. In other words, this question cannot be resolved without the participation of the Germans themselves. This also means that all those who truly strive for the unification of Germany cannot but hope that the two parts of Germany will reach reconciliation in terms of jointly striving to safeguard European security and in terms of internal German affairs."

Bulganin finally emphasized: "This is the only feasible path leading to German unification and satisfying the legitimate national aspirations of the German people. There is no doubt that the Soviet government will firmly uphold this line in the future when studying the German question."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: According to TASS, Berlin: The Soviet government delegation, composed of Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Nikita Khrushchev, laid wreaths on the 24th in Berlin at the monument to Soviet soldiers who died in the battle to liberate Berlin and at the graves of outstanding fighters of the German workers' movement.

On the 24th, the Soviet government delegation also visited the Berlin Young Pioneer summer camp—"Ernst Thälmann Young Pioneer Republic."

### 在日内瓦会议结束后应民主德国政府的邀请  苏联政府代表团到达柏林

    在日内瓦会议结束后应民主德国政府的邀请
    苏联政府代表团到达柏林
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：包括苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在内的苏联政府代表团，应德意志民主共和国政府的邀请，二十四日从日内瓦到达柏林。
    在什涅菲尔德机场上迎接苏联政府代表团的有：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨和政府其他高级负责人员，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局的委员们和中央委员会的书记们，各民主党派、群众团体和社会各界的领袖以及柏林各企业、机关、学校的代表。
    前往欢迎苏联政府代表团的，还有苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使普希金，驻德苏军部队总司令、苏联元帅安·安·格列奇科，苏联大使馆高级官员，驻德苏军司令部代表和各国外交使团的人员。
    格罗提渥在机场上致欢迎词。他说：上星期，全世界各国人民，包括德国人民在内，都密切地注视着日内瓦。由于苏联提出了关于保障所有国家的安全、裁军和禁止原子武器问题以及解决德国问题的建设性建议，日内瓦谈判已经使国际紧张局势得到了普遍缓和。现在很明显，苏联和整个民主阵营的坚持不渝的和平政策和它们的互相谅解的愿望，对于国际局势的发展发生了决定性影响。在日内瓦举行的关于停止冷战的谈判已经表明：全世界各国人民反对实力政策，赞成国际互相谅解和和平共处。德国和德国人民得到了和平、民主地恢复他们祖国统一的新希望。如果说四国在日内瓦能够作到缓和紧张局势，那末，德国两个部分的德国人必须作同样的事情：就德国问题达成协议。这是我们德国人从日内瓦会议工作中得出的一个重要的结论。
    布尔加宁接着发表了谈话。他说：我们是从日内瓦到你们这里来的，在日内瓦，苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议刚刚结束。日内瓦会议无疑会对国际局势产生一种有利的影响。
    会议作出的决定和政府首脑们总结会议结果的最后发言已经公布了。这些文件说明了会议工作的积极结果。
    布尔加宁说：在德国问题上，会议作出了一致同意的决定。这个决定大意说，德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国这件事，必须在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下实现。然而，我们不能闭着眼睛不看这个事实：在会议上表现了对待德国问题的解决的两种不同的态度。
    布尔加宁说：西方三国代表团坚持说，正在重新军国主义化的西德以及日后的统一的德国必须根据巴黎协定成为北大西洋公约组织和西欧军事联盟的成员，也就是成为西方国家军事集团的成员。大家知道，苏联政府已经不止一次地声明：把西德包括在北大西洋公约组织和西欧军事联盟内以及西德接受巴黎协定的条件的这种举动，排除了在和平民主的基础上统一德国的可能性。因此，苏联代表团主张通过另一条途径来统一德国。我们认为：首先，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国以及日后的统一的德国应该成为全欧集体安全体系的一部分，应该参加欧洲安全条约，这个条约必须保障和平，而不至于引起那种意味着莫大的战争恐怖并且使人民遭受苦难的军国主义的复活。
    布尔加宁说：苏联代表团还认为：如果不考虑德国目前的实际情况，德国问题是不能得到解决的。在第二次世界大战结束后的十年中，在德国的领土上形成了两个主权国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。这两个国家各有自己的经济和社会制度。它们各自的主权都得到其他国家的承认。这意味着：不考虑德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的意见，统一德国的问题就不能得到解决。换句话说，没有德国人自己参加，这个问题就不能得到解决。这也意味着：一切真正为德国的统一而努力的人都不能不希望德国两个部分在为保障欧洲安全进行共同努力方面和在德国内部事务方面取得和解。
    布尔加宁最后着重指出：这是导致德国统一、满足德国人民的正当的民族愿望的唯一可行的道路。毫无疑问，苏联政府将来在研究德国问题时也将坚定地维护这条路线。
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：由苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫组成的苏联政府代表团二十四日在柏林向在解放柏林的战斗中牺牲的苏军战士纪念碑以及德国工人运动杰出战士墓献花圈。
    二十四日，苏联政府代表团还访问了柏林少年先锋队夏令营——“恩斯特·台尔曼少年先锋队共和国”。
