    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from TASS: The National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany organized a mass rally of the working people of Berlin in Berlin on the 26th to welcome the visit of the Soviet government delegation, composed of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to the German Democratic Republic.
    The rally was held in Marx-Engels Square, with the participation of 250,000 working people of Berlin. Many red flags and slogans were flying in the ranks of the participants, with slogans calling for strengthening the unbreakable friendship between the people of Germany and the Soviet Union, and for strengthening world peace.
    Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Loch, gave the opening address to the conference. Amidst stormy applause from the participants, he invited the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, to speak.
    Grotewohl said that the Geneva Conference had not disappointed the expectations of the people of all countries. The Geneva directive decided that the foreign ministers of the four major powers would study measures to completely eliminate the Cold War and establish an atmosphere of trust in the world. This is a great victory on the road to peaceful coexistence among all countries.
    Grotewohl believes that the Soviet delegation's proposal at the Geneva Conference on establishing a collective security system in two stages meets the demands of the people of all countries for peace and security, and can also give the German people hope of finding a way to peacefully resolve their own vital problems within a certain period of time.
    Grotewohl said that the Western countries' attempt to pull a unified Germany into the Atlantic Pact is something we absolutely and will never accept. The only way to a unified Germany lies in the joint efforts of the four powers, and must have the participation of the German people. He pointed out that the easing of tensions, trust and mutual understanding are most conducive to the establishment of a European collective security system, and that the two parts of Germany can participate in this system on an equal footing before German unification. However, if West Germany pursues a policy of re-militarization and threatens the fruits of victory of the German Democratic Republic, the atmosphere of trust and the easing of tensions cannot develop.
    Grotewohl said that the interests of the German people require an end to West German militarization, and require the two parts of Germany to reach mutual understanding on the issue of democratic and peaceful reunification. This is the consistent position of the German Democratic Republic. In West Germany, more and more people also advocate reaching mutual understanding with their brothers in the German Democratic Republic as soon as possible, and are unwilling to participate in one-sided military blocs, which deepen the division of Germany.
    Grotewohl said that the reunification of Germany is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves. The German people should do everything possible to seize the opportunities given to us by the Geneva Conference to ensure the complete success of the foreign ministers' meeting in October in resolving the German question. The easing of international tensions achieved in Geneva will help bring the two parts of Germany closer together and create favorable preconditions for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. No one should evade this opportunity. Anyone who still obstructs mutual understanding between Germans will surely be abandoned by everyone.
    After Grotewohl spoke, Loch then invited Khrushchev to speak. A storm of sustained applause resounded across the square. The entire audience listened quietly to Khrushchev's speech, which was repeatedly interrupted by storms of applause.
    After Khrushchev spoke, a representative of the Social Democratic Party of West Berlin spoke at the meeting.
    Finally, the conference adopted a telegram of thanks from the National Front of Democratic Germany to the Soviet Union, thanking the Soviet Union for its position at the Geneva Conference.

    欢迎苏联政府代表团访问民主德国
    柏林举行二十五万人的群众大会
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会二十六日在柏林组织了柏林劳动人民群众大会，欢迎由苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫晓鲁夫组成的苏联政府代表团对德意志民主共和国的访问。
    大会在马克思—恩格斯广场举行，参加大会的有二十五万柏林劳动人民，在参加大会的队伍中飘扬着许多红旗和标语，标语上写着要求加强德苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊、要求加强世界和平的口号。
    德意志民主共和国副总理洛赫向大会致开会词，他在与会者暴风雨般的掌声下请德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥讲话。
    格罗提渥说，日内瓦会议没有辜负各国人民的期望。日内瓦指示决定，四大国外长将研究彻底消除冷战和建立世界上的信任气氛的措施，这是各国人民和平共处道路上的巨大胜利。
    格罗提渥认为苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上所提出的关于分两阶段建立集体安全体系的建议符合各国人民对和平和安全的要求，而且也可以使德国人民有希望在一定时期内，求得和平解决自己的切身问题的办法。
    格罗提渥说，西方国家想把统一的德国拉进大西洋公约的企图是我们绝对而且永远不能接受的，统一德国的唯一道路在于四国共同努力，并且必须有德国人民的参加。他指出，紧张局势的缓和、信任和互相谅解最能促进欧洲集体安全体系的建立，而德国两部分在德国统一以前可以在平等基础上参加这个体系。但是，如果西德执行重新军国主义化的政策并且威胁着德意志民主共和国的胜利果实的话，信任气氛和紧张局势的缓和是不可能发展的。
    格罗提渥说，德国人民的利益要求终止西德军国主义化，要求德国两部分就民主和和平地恢复统一的问题取得相互谅解。这是德意志民主共和国的一贯主张。在西德，越来越多的人也主张同德意志民主共和国的兄弟们尽快取得互相谅解，而不愿参加片面的军事集团，加深德国的分裂。
    格罗提渥说，德国的重新统一首先是德国人民自己的事情。德国人民应该尽一切力量利用日内瓦会议给我们的机会，促使十月间举行的外长会议完全成功地解决德国问题。在日内瓦所获得的国际紧张局势的缓和将有助于德国两部分的接近，并且为在和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国创造有利的先决条件。任何人都不应当规避这种机会。谁现在仍旧阻碍德国人之间达成相互谅解，谁就一定会被大家所抛弃。
    格罗提渥讲话后，洛赫接着请赫鲁晓夫讲话。广场上响起了暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全场静听了赫鲁晓夫的讲话，他的讲话多次被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    赫鲁晓夫讲话后，西柏林社会民主党的一位代表在大会上讲了话。
    大会最后通过民主德国全国阵线致苏联的谢电，感谢苏联在日内瓦会议上所采取的立场。
