A Word of Advice to the Thai Government

Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram announced on the 15th that, due to the events in Laos, he had ordered the Thai army to "prepare." Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wan Waithayakon also stated that the Thai government had requested the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to hold a meeting to study the situation in Laos. At the same time, the US State Department immediately announced that the United States would not oppose Thailand's proposal.

The attitude expressed by the Thai government leaders is reminiscent of the news revealed by the Thai newspaper "Siam Rath." When the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military advisory meeting was held in Bangkok this month, the newspaper reported, based on the words of Thai military experts regarding the military plan drafted at the meeting, that in the event of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam being subjected to so-called "communist attacks," Thailand would immediately send military forces to Indochina.

It is difficult to understand what benefits spreading such news and advocating that the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization study the situation in Laos would bring to Thailand. If the United States uses the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to carry out armed intervention in Indochina, it will inevitably completely destroy the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina and reignite the flames of war in Indochina. At that time, Thailand, which is adjacent to Indochina, will be in the front line. Is this what the Thai government leaders want?

Thailand is an Asian country, and its fate is linked to the fate of other Asian countries. Asian countries demand peace. At the recent Asian-African Conference, Asian countries, including Thailand, expressed their desire to promote world peace. It is precisely because of this that many Asian countries are now working hard to strive for peace and to ease the tension in the Asian region. These actions of the Thai government are obviously inconsistent with its statements at the Asian-African Conference, and they will certainly not bring any benefits to Thailand.

Thai government leaders often say that the Dai Autonomous Region within China threatens Thailand. Thai Police Director-General and Deputy Minister of Interior Nai Phao Sriyanond also said on the 15th that there are so-called "Viet Minh battalions" in the Lao resistance forces, and that these "Viet Minh battalions" came from Jinghong (Chiang Rung), where the People's Government of the Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan, China, is located. He also said that Jinghong (Chiang Rung) "seems to have become" a "base" for the so-called "Viet Minh battalions." The Chinese people protest against this inaccurate statement.

Regarding the issue of ethnic minority autonomous regions within China, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai has already made it very clear at the Asian-African Conference. Just as Burma has the Shan State, various ethnic minorities in China have their own ethnic autonomous regions and exercise their right to autonomy. How can it be said to be a threat to neighboring countries? What is the basis for the Thai authorities to say that "Viet Minh battalions" went from China to Laos? In fact, this irresponsible fabrication can only benefit the US aggression policy and will never benefit Thailand's interests.

Not long ago, Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wan Waithayakon expressed the hope that the four-power summit would be able to do something to ease international tensions. The Chinese people are working hard to ease tensions, and we advocate living in harmony with all our neighbors. However, easing tensions is not only the responsibility of the four powers, but also the common responsibility of all countries that hope to avoid the disaster of war. Since the Thai government also hopes for the easing of the international situation, it should not do anything that would help US aggression and exacerbate international tensions.

### 向泰国政府进一言

    向泰国政府进一言
    泰国总理銮披汶在十五日宣布，由于在老挝发生的事件，他已经命令泰国陆军“进行准备”。泰国外交部长旺亲王并且表示，泰国政府已经要求所谓东南亚条约组织举行会议研究老挝局势。同时，美国国务院立即宣布美国将不反对泰国提出的这个建议。
    泰国政府首领所表示的这种态度，使人联想到泰国报纸“暹罗群众报”曾经透露的消息。在所谓东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议本月在曼谷举行的时候，这家报纸根据泰国军事专家的话报道会议所拟订的军事计划说，在一旦老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部受到所谓“共产党攻击”时，泰国要立即赶派军事力量到印度支那去。
    散播这样的消息，主张所谓东南亚条约组织研究老挝局势，究竟对泰国有什么好处是很难令人理解的，美国通过东南亚条约集团对印度支那进行武装干涉，就必然要彻底破坏关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议，在印度支那重燃战火。那时候，同印度支那隔邻的泰国将处在首当其冲的地位。难道这是泰国政府首领们所要求的吗？
    泰国是一个亚洲国家，它的命运和其他亚洲国家的命运是联系在一起的。亚洲国家是要求和平的。在不久以前的亚非会议上，亚洲国家，包括泰国在内，都表示要促进世界和平。正是因为这样，所以现在许多亚洲国家都在为争取和平、为缓和亚洲地区的紧张局势而努力。泰国政府的这些行动显然是和它在亚非会议上的表示相矛盾的，同时也绝不会为泰国带来任何好处。
    泰国政府领袖们时常说在中国境内有傣族自治区威胁了泰国。泰国警察总监兼内政部副部长乃炮·是耶暖在十五日还说在寮国抗战部队中有所谓“越盟营”，并且说这种“越盟营”是从中国云南傣族自治区人民政府所在地景洪（车里）去的。他还说景洪（车里）“似乎已成”所谓“越盟营”的“基地”。中国人民抗议这种不合乎事实的说法。
    关于中国境内少数民族自治区的问题，中国总理周恩来在亚非会议上已经说得非常清楚，好像缅甸有掸族自治邦一样，在中国境内各少数民族都有他们的民族自治区，实行自治权利，如何能说是威胁邻邦？泰国当局究竟根据什么说什么从中国到寮国去的“越盟营”？事实上，这种不负责任的虚构，只能对美国的侵略政策有利，而绝不会有利于泰国的利益。
    不久以前，泰国外交部长旺亲王曾经表示希望四大国政府首脑会议能够作出一些事情来缓和国际紧张局势。中国人民正在努力于缓和局势的紧张，我们主张同我们的一切邻邦和睦相处。但是缓和紧张局势不仅仅是四大国的责任，而是一切希望避免战争灾难的国家的共同责任。泰国政府既然也希望国际局势缓和，它就不应当做出任何足以助长美国侵略、加剧国际紧张局势的事情。
