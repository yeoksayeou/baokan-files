The First Five-Year Plan, proposed by the Chinese Communist Party and adopted by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, is a specific program for realizing the general task of the transition period in our country. In realizing this program and in the great cause of building socialism in our country, the people's democratic dictatorship plays a particularly important role.

The state is a product of irreconcilable class contradictions and, generally, is the political organization of the economically dominant class, an instrument for this class to rule another class. The state is a political superstructure built on a certain economic foundation, and at the same time, it is the most powerful force, actively helping to form and consolidate its foundation. This is only natural, because "the reason why the foundation creates the superstructure is to make the superstructure serve it, to make the superstructure actively help it form and consolidate itself, and to make the superstructure actively fight to eliminate the outdated foundation and its old superstructure."

Our people's democratic dictatorship is built on the foundation of fundamental changes in economic relations after the victory of the revolution. Similarly, it cannot be indifferent to its own foundation. On the contrary, it must make the greatest effort to eliminate the old foundation and its superstructure, and help its own foundation to form and develop. The people's democratic dictatorship is fundamentally different from capitalist states. It plays a particularly important role in social life, and it is the organizer of our entire social, economic, political, and cultural life. This means that it not only bears the great task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and defending the motherland, but also the great task of organizing economic, cultural, and educational construction. The reason why the people's democratic dictatorship plays such an important role in social life is that it is not a state where a few exploiters rule the broad masses of working people, but a state of the people themselves, a state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. All activities of this state are not aimed at maintaining and preserving the system of exploitation, but at gradually eliminating poverty and the system of exploitation through appropriate paths, and establishing a prosperous and happy socialist society. The socialist economic structure will not be formed in the old society, and even after the people have seized power, it will not arise naturally. The socialist economy can only be produced and developed through the state's planned activities and the creative labor of the masses. Thus, the people's democratic dictatorship has to create and develop this economy "on vacant land." At the same time, after confiscating the property of bureaucratic capitalism, the people's democratic dictatorship has grasped the important economic lifeline of the country, directly shouldered the task of managing the economy, and can use this as a basis to practically influence and lead the entire national economy. The reason why the people's democratic dictatorship plays such a particularly important role in social life is also because its activities are not blind and "arbitrary," but rely on the understanding of the objective laws of economic development, and formulate laws and carry out all its daily work on the basis of this understanding. The people's democratic dictatorship is the most powerful weapon in the hands of the Chinese people for building a socialist society.

The tasks of the people's democratic dictatorship in organizing economic construction and cultural and educational construction have been determined in principle in our Constitution through legislative procedures. The First Five-Year Plan makes specific provisions for the state's tasks in this regard. However, the state's leadership of the economy is by no means limited to formulating laws and drafting resolutions and instructions (which are of course very important), but also to be specifically responsible for managing and organizing the development of the economy. For example, the state directly manages state-owned industry, transportation, commerce, and agriculture, strives to prioritize the development of the socialist economy, and uses the socialist economy as the leading force to influence, guide, and transform other non-socialist economies through state policies and laws. The state realizes this task by organizing and guiding domestic commodity circulation, formulating price policies, tax policies, and wage policies, organizing currency turnover and fiscal credit systems, determining the accumulation and use of funds, controlling foreign trade, and training and allocating labor and technical cadres... etc.

The state's control of the lifeline of the social economy is a prerequisite for implementing a planned economy, and the planned guidance of the development of the national economy is necessary for building socialism. Only a planned economy can ensure the comprehensive development of social production, ensure the leading role of the socialist economy, and ensure the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the transition of small commodity production to socialism. It is none other than the state that uses the planned economy to guide the development and transformation of the national economy based on the social conditions of our country, and gradually incorporates capitalist and individual economies into the track of the state plan. Moreover, the economic plan is by no means a list of numbers or a list of work tasks. It should become an organizational force, turn into the practical actions of the masses and be realized. The state mobilizes and organizes the masses, uses labor emulation as the main method, promotes the initiative and creativity of the masses, continuously improves labor productivity, vigorously promotes increased production and thrift, taps the potential of enterprises, and strives to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

The main task of the state during the transition period is to realize socialist industrialization. The First Five-Year Plan is a major step in realizing the general task of the transition period, so industrial construction is the center of our country's First Five-Year Plan, and the priority development of heavy industry is the center of socialist industrialization. Because only heavy industry can promote the development of the entire industry, the modernization of agriculture and transportation, a solid national defense, and the transformation of non-socialist economies. And, in the final analysis, only heavy industry can guarantee the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The state of the people's democratic dictatorship must solve the problem of the industrialization of this country step by step." Today, the people of the whole country are fighting to solve this great historical task. The people's democratic dictatorship is the organizer of the industrialization cause. The state correctly uses accumulation according to the Five-Year Plan, concentrates its main strength on developing heavy industry, organizes large-scale capital construction, allocates corresponding manpower, and strives to promote advanced technology. Relying on the planned leadership of the economy, the state, with the help of its management organs and laws, vigorously develops industry, especially heavy industry, and constantly increases the proportion of socialist economic components in the national economy.

The socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts is a necessary component of our country's socialist construction. Because socialism is nothing more than an economic structure that combines industry and agriculture on the basis of public ownership of the means of production. Without the socialization of agriculture, not only can farmers not be lifted out of poverty, but there can be no rapid development of industry, and therefore there is no complete and solid socialism. Our people's democratic dictatorship can never be established on two different foundations for a long time: socialist large industry and small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, building socialism must solve the contradiction between the small-scale peasant economy and socialist industrialization. We must carry out the socialist transformation of the small-scale production individual economy. This is the most complex and arduous task in socialist construction. Although the state is still restricted by the individual economy in directly organizing agriculture today, the state must actively lead and influence the development of agriculture with socialist industry, commerce, and cooperative economy. On the one hand, the state adopts a policy of restricting and then eliminating the rich peasants, and at the same time, it concretely encourages and guides small producers to transition to socialism along the path of cooperation through economic and financial, political and cultural, cadre and technical assistance.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also a necessary component of socialist construction. Because the long-term coexistence and "non-interference" of capitalism and socialism in a country is unimaginable, and socialism is to eliminate the system of class exploitation. However, because capitalism in our country still occupies a considerable proportion of the national economy and has a certain positive role, the state does not adopt the method of eliminating landlords to immediately expropriate it. However, it should be seen that with the development of socialist construction, the negative aspects of capitalism are increasingly revealed and are increasingly unsuitable for the nature of the development of productive forces. The entire process of socialist construction requires the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, so that social production continues to rise. The state's task in this regard is to implement the positive role of using capitalist industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and to restrict its negative role that is unfavorable to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, through the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, and to encourage and guide them to transform into various forms of state capitalism according to needs and possibilities, and gradually replace capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people.

In our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is an inevitable phenomenon that the growth of the people's consumption capacity exceeds the development of the production of consumer goods. In order to strictly prohibit profiteering by unscrupulous merchants and stabilize market prices; in order to protect the interests of agricultural producers and the needs of the people's livelihood, and to make socialist construction proceed smoothly, it is necessary to strengthen the position of state-owned and cooperative-run commerce, and gradually implement direct and indirect statistics and supervision of social production and consumption. The state has already adopted the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of major daily consumer goods—grain, edible oil, cotton cloth—and the planned purchase of cotton, which are the most important measures in this regard.

Our goal in building socialism is to meet the growing material and cultural needs of society. The highest criterion for our state activities is to always care for the welfare of the people. The state organizes various people's welfare undertakings and gradually improves the people's living standards based on the economic development of our country.

The masses of the people, first and foremost the workers and peasants, are the true builders of socialism. If the people's cultural and technical knowledge is not improved, and the people's socialist consciousness is not raised, then the construction cause cannot succeed. Because the state directly manages educational organs, cultural organs, and scientific organs, and leads the cultural and educational work of other social organizations, it has become the organizer of our country's cultural and educational undertakings. The state takes various measures to improve the people's cultural and technical level and promote the development of our country's science and art, according to the policy of serving production. One of the major tasks we must complete in the First Five-Year Plan is to train a large number of engineering and technical personnel, skilled workers, and other specialized talents in all fields who are loyal to the motherland and the cause of socialism and who possess modern scientific and technological knowledge. The state, through its own cultural publishing organs and various propaganda tools such as newspapers and periodicals, resolutely criticizes bourgeois ideology and conducts ideological education in Marxism-Leninism to the people, in order to cultivate people's patriotic enthusiasm, conscious discipline, and socialist labor attitude.

Because domestic exploiting classes still exist, and the capitalist encirclement and the threat of war have not been eliminated, the realization of the Five-Year Plan will not be smooth sailing without struggle. On the contrary, this is an increasingly sharp and increasingly complex class struggle. It should be known that the realization of the Five-Year Plan is a special form of class struggle in the present environment. All enemies of the people are watching our construction and victory with eager eyes, and of course they will come to undermine our cause. The domestic classes that have been overthrown will never submit obediently, all kinds of counter-revolutionaries have not been eliminated, and imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies will intensify their efforts to send their pawns to the mainland. All these elements who hate the people are engaged in various criminal activities: destroying enterprises, stealing intelligence, spreading rumors and incitement, and even carrying out assassinations, attempting to subvert the people's regime. At the same time, resolute reactionary elements from the classes that will be eliminated are refusing transformation by transferring funds, squandering and wasting, and even destroying machines, killing workers and cadres, and colluding with other domestic counter-revolutionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

It should be noted that due to the victory of our construction, the consolidation and strengthening of the people's regime, and the increasing isolation of counter-revolutionaries among the people, this has made all counter-revolutionaries unite in an organized manner to engage in conspiratorial activities in order to achieve the common goal of opposing socialism. It should be noted even more that since the victory of the Chinese revolution, the adoption of double-dealing tactics to conduct concealed struggles against us has become the main strategy for counter-revolutionaries to carry out activities. They have become more concealed, more cunning, and even disguise themselves as "loyal" supporters of the Communist Party, break into our "liver," and engage in sabotage. The materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique recently revealed by the "People's Daily" prove this in the best possible way. The Hu Feng clique, a political conspiracy group with a complete counter-revolutionary program and strategy and tactics under the guise of "literature and art," took advantage of our麻痹and credulity and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities around us for more than 20 years. All kinds of counter-revolutionaries were gathered in this group. The struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other counter-revolutionaries is a concentrated manifestation of the current intensification of class struggle.

Our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation are carried out in fierce struggle with all enemies. The people's democratic dictatorship plays a major role in protecting the smooth progress of this construction and transformation and preventing it from being undermined by enemies. The people's democratic dictatorship is the sharpest weapon for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "Our state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to ensure the victorious achievements of the people's revolution and to oppose the restoration conspiracy of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon." The state relies on its police, courts, prisons, and other organs, and resolutely suppresses all counter-revolutionaries with the support of the people, "only allowing them to be well-behaved, and not allowing them to talk nonsense and act recklessly." On the one hand, the state prohibits the illegal acts of capitalists and punishes those capitalists who resist transformation according to law, and on the other hand, it must ruthlessly smash all counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The state must also severely punish those embezzlers, thieves, and hooligans separately in order to maintain revolutionary order and protect the people's property from infringement.

When we are fighting against domestic enemies, we cannot fail to see that the union of all domestic counter-revolutionaries and their collusion with imperialism to become its pawns is the law of the development of the current class struggle. The fact is clear that imperialism is the backstage boss of domestic counter-revolutionaries and the planner of all counter-revolutionary activities. Imperialism, especially US imperialism, not only intensifies the organization and dispatch of special agents to our country to engage in subversive activities, but also openly establishes military bases around our country, forcibly occupies our country's Taiwan, attempts to provoke war, invade our country, and help counter-revolutionaries to restore their power, in order to re-transform China into their colony. The state is the protector of the security of the motherland. The state, through reconnaissance organs and punishment organs, resolutely detects and punishes special agents, spies, and all saboteurs who are organized and dispatched by imperialism to infiltrate our country. The state firmly and unswervingly implements a peaceful diplomatic policy, stands on the side of the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union, establishes friendship and cooperation with all peace-loving countries, and opposes the imperialist war policy. At the same time, the state must be a hundred times more vigilant, vigorously strengthen its military strength, and consolidate national defense in order to prepare for the military offensive that imperialism may launch suddenly.

In the five years since the founding of the country, our country has achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts. In the future, with the development of socialist construction, the role of the people's democratic dictatorship, especially in economic organization, will become increasingly important. Therefore, the consolidation and development of the people's democratic regime itself has become a very important issue. Only with the consolidation and strength of the people's regime can the Five-Year Plan be successfully realized, and can the socialist construction cause be victorious. Chairman Mao said: "Our current task is to strengthen the people's state machine, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to protect national defense and protect the interests of the people. As a condition for this, China will be able to steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist society and a communist society, eliminate classes and realize great harmony under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party."

The development of the construction cause requires state organs to carry out more precise and meticulous work and to raise the organization and leadership of the economy to a higher level. This requires constantly adhering to opposing bureaucracy, maximizing the participation of the masses in state management, strengthening organization and discipline, and implementing systematic inspection and supervision of state organ staff. And strictly implement the policy of streamlining and economizing in state organs at all levels, merging and abolishing overlapping institutions, improving work efficiency, eliminating any waste, in order to improve and consolidate state administrative organs.

The most important thing in consolidating and improving state organs is to strengthen the Communist Party's leadership over the state. This leadership is the decisive condition for the state to better play its role and develop soundly. Of course, the Party is not a state organization, nor can it replace state organs. The Party's leadership over the state lies in the fact that the Party uses its collective wisdom to formulate policies for the entire work of the state. The Party realizes these policies through state organs and unifies the activities of state organs. The Party supervises the activities of state organs and corrects its errors and deviations. The Party sends its outstanding members to leading positions in the state and selects and promotes personnel with both ability and integrity (Party and non-Party) to work in state organs. With its prestige among the people, the Party mobilizes and organizes the masses to support the state's measures and realize the state's tasks. The Party is the leading force of the state. Any practice of weakening or even abandoning the Party's leadership is extremely wrong and can ruin our entire cause.

While all our people are realizing the First Five-Year Plan with the greatest labor enthusiasm, we should firmly grasp and use the weapon of the state and consolidate and improve this weapon. As Chairman Mao said: "As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with international friends, we will always be victorious."

    国家在社会主义建设中的作用
    姚锡华
    中国共产党提出的、提交第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的第一个五年计划，是在我国实现过渡时期总任务的具体纲领。在实现这个纲领和为在我国建设社会主义的伟大事业中，人民民主专政的国家，具有特别重大的作用。
    国家是阶级矛盾不可调和的产物，按通例，是经济上占统治地位的阶级的政治组织，是这个阶级统治另一个阶级的工具。国家是建立在一定经济基础之上的政治上层建筑，同时它又是最强大的力量，积极地帮助自己基础的形成和巩固。这是很自然的，因为“基础之所以创立上层建筑，也就是为了要使上层建筑替它服务，要使上层建筑积极帮助它形成起来和巩固起来，要使上层建筑积极为消灭已经过时的基础及其旧上层建筑而斗争。”
    我国人民民主专政的国家，就是建立在革命胜利后经济关系发生根本变化的基础之上的。同样，它对于自己的基础是不能漠不关心的，相反，它要以最大努力来消灭旧基础及其上层建筑，帮助自己的基础形成和发展。人民民主专政的国家和资本主义国家截然不同，它在社会生活中起着特殊重要的作用，它是我们整个社会经济、政治和文化生活的组织者。这就是说，它不仅负有镇压反革命和保卫祖国的巨大任务，而且负有组织经济和文化教育建设事业的巨大任务。人民民主专政的国家在社会生活中之所以具有如此重大的作用，是因为它不是少数剥削者统治广大劳动人民的国家，而是人民自己的国家，是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的国家。这个国家的一切活动不是为了维护和保全剥削制度，而是为了经过妥善的道路逐步消灭贫困和剥削制度，建立繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。社会主义的经济结构是不会在旧社会里形成的，即是在人民取得政权之后，它也不会自然而然地产生出来。社会主义经济只有国家有计划的活动和人民群众创造性的劳动才能产生和发展。这样，人民民主专政的国家就不得不在“空地上”去创立和发展这种经济。同时，人民民主专政的国家在没收官僚资本主义的财产之后，就掌握了国家的重要经济命脉，直接负起了管理经济的任务，并能以此为根据在实际上影响和领导整个国民经济。人民民主专政的国家在社会生活中之所以具有如此特别重大的作用，还因为它的活动不是盲目的、“为所欲为”的，而是倚据着对于客观经济发展规律的认识，并在这种认识的基础上制定法律和进行自己全部日常工作。人民民主专政的国家是我国人民手中建立社会主义社会的最强有力的武器。
                ×　×　×
    人民民主专政的国家在组织经济建设和文化教育建设事业方面的任务，已在我国宪法中用立法手续在原则上确定下来。而第一个五年计划就国家在这方面的任务又作了具体的规定。但是国家对经济的领导，绝不限于制定法律，草拟决议、指示（这当然是非常重要的），而且还要具体负责管理和组织发展经济的事务。比如，国家直接管理着国营的工业、运输业、商业和农业，竭力优先发展社会主义经济，并以社会主义经济为领导力量，通过国家政策、法令来影响、指导和改造其他非社会主义的经济。国家通过组织和指导国内的商品流通，规定价格政策、税收政策和工资政策，组织货币周转和财政信贷制度，确定资金的积累和使用，管制对外贸易，培养、分配劳动力和技术干部……等等方面来实现这个任务。
    国家掌握社会经济命脉是实行计划经济的先决条件，而有计划地指导国民经济的发展，又是建设社会主义所必需的。只有计划经济才能保证社会生产的全面发展，保证社会主义经济的领导作用，保证对资本主义工商业的改造和使小商品生产过渡到社会主义。不是别的，正是国家倚据我国社会状况，用计划经济指导国民经济的发展和改造，并逐步把资本主义和个体经济纳入国家计划的轨道。不仅如此，经济计划绝不是一张数字单或工作任务一览表，它应当成为一种组织力量，变为群众的实际行动而加以实现。国家动员和组织群众，以劳动竞赛作为主要方法，发扬群众的积极首创精神，不断提高劳动生产率，厉行增产节约，发挥企业的潜力，争取完成和超额完成国家计划。
    国家在过渡时期的总任务，主要的是实现社会主义工业化。第一个五年计划既是实现过渡时期总任务的重大步骤，所以工业建设也就是我国第一个五年计划的中心，而优先发展重工业又是社会主义工业化的中心。因为只有重工业才有整个工业的发展，才有农业、运输业的现代化，才有巩固的国防，才能对非社会主义经济实现改造。并且，归根到底，也只有重工业才能保证不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中就已指出：“人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个国家工业化的问题。”今天全国人民正在为解决这个伟大历史任务而斗争。人民民主专政的国家则是工业化事业的组织者。国家按照五年计划正确地使用积累，集中主要力量发展重工业，组织规模宏大的基本建设，调配相应的人力，努力推进先进技术。国家凭借着对经济的计划领导，在自己的管理机关和法律的帮助下，大力发展工业，尤其是重工业，并使社会主义经济成份在国民经济中的比重不断上升。
    对农业、手工业的社会主义改造，是我国社会主义建设事业中必要的组成部分之一。因为社会主义无非就是在生产资料公有制基础上工业同农业结合的经济结构。没有农业的社会化，不但不能使农民摆脱贫困，也不能有工业的迅速发展，因而也就没有完备和巩固的社会主义。我们的人民民主专政的国家决不能长久地建立在社会主义大工业和小农经济两个不同的基础上。因此，建设社会主义就必须解决小农经济同社会主义工业化间的矛盾。必须对小生产个体经济进行社会主义改造。这是社会主义建设中最复杂、最艰巨的任务。虽然国家今天在直接组织农业方面还受到个体经济的限制，但国家要积极地以社会主义的工业、商业和合作社经济去领导和影响农业的发展。国家一方面采取对富农由限制到消灭的政策，同时通过经济和财政，政治和文化，干部和技术的帮助，来具体鼓励和指导小生产者按照合作化的道路过渡到社会主义。
    对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也是社会主义建设事业的必要的组成部分之一。因为资本主义和社会主义在一国内长期并存和“互不干扰”是不可想像的，而社会主义就是要消灭阶级剥削制度。但是，由于我国资本主义在国民经济中还占有相当的比重，并且有着一定的积极作用，所以国家不采取消灭地主的方法把它立刻剥夺。可是应当看到，随着社会主义建设的发展，资本主义的消极方面就日益显露，就日益不适合生产力发展的性质。社会主义建设的全部进程，要求对资本主义工商业逐步实现社会主义改造，使社会生产不断高涨。国家在这方面的任务，就是依据宪法规定，通过国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，贯彻利用资本主义工商业有利于国计民生的积极作用，限制它的不利于国计民生的消极作用，根据需要和可能，鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义，逐步地以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。
    在我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，人民消费能力的增长超过消费品生产的发展，是一个不可避免的现象。为了严禁奸商投机倒把，稳定市场价格；为了保障农业生产者的利益和人民生活的需要，使社会主义建设顺利进行，就必须加强国营和合作社营商业的阵地，逐步对社会生产和消费实行直接和间接的统计和监督。国家已经采取的对主要日用消费品——粮食、食油、棉布的计划收购和计划供应以及棉花的计划收购政策，就是在这方面最重要的措施。
    我们建设社会主义的目的，就是为了满足社会日益增长的物质和文化的需要。我们国家活动的最高准则，也就是经常关怀人民的福利。国家根据我国经济发展状况，举办各种人民福利事业，逐步提高人民生活水平。
    人民群众，首先是工农群众，是社会主义的真正建设者。如果不提高人民的文化、技术知识，不提高人民的社会主义觉悟，那末建设事业就不能成功。国家由于直接管理着教育机关，文化机关，科学机关，并且领导着其他社会团体的文化教育工作，所以就成了我国文化教育事业的组织者。国家根据为生产服务的方针，采取种种措施提高人民文化技术水平，促进我国科学、艺术的发展。我们在第一个五年计划中必须完成的重大任务之一，就是培养大量忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学技术知识的工程技术人员、熟练工人及其它各方面的专门人材。国家通过自己的文化出版机关和报刊等各种宣传工具，坚决批判资产阶级思想，向人民进行马克思列宁主义的思想教育，借以培养人们的爱国热情、自觉的纪律和社会主义劳动态度。
                ×　×　×
    由于国内剥削阶级仍然存在，资本主义包围和战争威胁也没有消除，所以实现五年计划也就不会是风平浪静没有斗争的。相反地，这是一场愈来愈尖锐，愈来愈复杂的阶级斗争。须知，实现五年计划，就是在现在环境下的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。人民的一切敌人都虎视眈眈地看着我们的建设和胜利，他们当然要来破坏我们的事业。国内已被打倒的阶级决不会俯首服贴，各式各类的反革命分子还没有肃清，帝国主义和蒋贼特务机关还会加紧地把它们的爪牙派遣到大陆来。所有这些仇视人民的分子，都在从事各种罪恶活动：破坏企业、窃取情报、造谣煽动以至实行暗杀，力图颠覆人民政权。同时，将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反动分子正在以转移资金、挥霍浪费以至毁坏机器、杀害工人和干部来拒绝改造，并同国内其他反革命分子勾结起来，进行反革命的阴谋活动。
    应当注意的是，由于我们建设的胜利，人民政权的巩固和增强，以及反革命分子在人民中的日益孤立，这就使得一切反革命分子为了达到反对社会主义的共同目的而有组织地联合在一起从事阴谋活动。更应当注意的是，从中国革命胜利以后，采取两面派手段来对我们进行隐蔽的斗争，已经成为反革命分子进行活动的主要策略。他们变得更加隐蔽，更加狡猾，甚至扮装成“忠心”拥护共产党的样子，打入到我们的“肝脏里”来，进行破坏。最近“人民日报”先后揭露的胡风反革命集团的材料，再好不过地证明了这一点。胡风集团这个打着“文艺”幌子、有着完整的反革命纲领和战略策略的政治阴谋集团，利用我们的麻痹和轻信，混在我们身边进行了二十多年的反革命勾当。在这个集团里纠集了形形色色的反革命分子。为肃清胡风反革命集团及其他一切反革命分子的斗争，就是目前阶级斗争尖锐化的集中表现。
    我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造就是在同一切敌人作剧烈斗争中进行的。人民民主专政的国家在保护这一建设和改造事业的顺利进行，不使它遭受敌人破坏，起着重大的作用。人民民主专政的国家，就是镇压反革命分子的最锐利的武器。毛主席曾指示我们：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”国家依靠自己的警察、法庭、监狱等机关，在人民支持下坚决镇压一切反革命分子，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动”。国家一方面禁止资本家的非法行为，依法制裁那些抗拒改造的资本家，另一方面也要无情地击破一切反革命的阴谋活动。国家同样要有分别地严惩那些贪污分子、盗窃分子和流氓分子，以便维持革命秩序，保护人民财产不受侵犯。
    当我们在同国内敌人作斗争的时候，不能不看到，国内所有反革命分子的联合，并同帝国主义勾结而成为它的走狗，这是当前阶级斗争发展的规律。事实很清楚，帝国主义是国内反革命分子的后台老板，是一切反革命活动的策划者。帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义，不但加紧地组织和派遣特务到我国来，从事颠覆活动，而且公然在我国周围建立军事基地，武力霸占我国的台湾，力图挑起战争，侵略我国，帮助反革命复辟，以期重新变中国为他们的殖民地。国家是祖国安全的保卫者。国家通过侦察机关、惩罚机关，坚决破获和惩治帝国主义所组织和派遣潜入我国的特务、间谍和一切破坏分子。国家坚定不移地执行和平外交政策，站在以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营这边，同所有爱好和平的国家建立友谊和合作，反对帝国主义的战争政策。国家同时不能不百倍地提高警惕，大力加强自己的军事力量，巩固国防，以准备应付帝国主义可能突然发动的军事进攻。
                ×　×　×
    建国五年多来，我们国家在各个战线上已取得了辉煌的成就。今后随着社会主义建设的发展，人民民主专政国家的作用，特别是在经济组织方面的作用将愈加显得重要。因之人民民主政权本身的巩固和发展就成了非常重要的问题。只有人民政权的巩固和强大，才有五年计划的顺利的实现，才有社会主义建设事业的胜利。毛主席说：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益。以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。”
    建设事业的发展，要求国家机关进行更加精确而细致的工作，把组织和领导经济提到更高的水平。这就必须经常地坚持反对官僚主义，最大限度地吸引群众参加国家管理，加强组织性和纪律性，对国家机关工作人员实行系统的检查和监督。并且在各级国家机关严格厉行精简节约的方针，合并和取消重叠的机构，提高工作效率，消除任何浪费现象，以便改进和巩固国家管理机关。
    巩固和改善国家机关，最重要的就是加强共产党对国家的领导，这种领导乃是国家能够更好发挥作用，能够健全发展的决定性条件。当然，党并不是国家组织，它也不能代替国家机关。党对国家的领导就在于党以自己的集体智慧，为国家整个工作制定政策。党通过国家机关并统一国家机关的活动来实现这些政策，党监督国家机关的活动，并纠正它的错误和偏向。党把自己优秀的党员派到国家领导岗位上，挑选和提拔德才兼备的工作人员（党和非党的）到国家机关中去工作。党以自己在人民中的威望，动员和组织群众支持国家的措施，实现国家的任务。党是国家的领导力量，任何削弱乃至放弃党的领导的做法，都是极端错误的，都能断送我们的全部事业。
    当我们全体人民正在以最大的劳动热情实现第一个五年计划的时候，我们应当紧紧地掌握和运用国家这个武器，巩固和改善这个武器。正如毛主席所说的：“只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。”
