    A Construction Unit with Poor Engineering Quality and Serious Waste
    By Our Staff Reporter Yu Ming
    When we hear that China's first domestically manufactured 6,000 kW steam turbine generator will be installed in Huainan City and will supply a large amount of industrial electricity, how enthusiastically we look forward to the early completion of the power plant's construction! However, the First Engineering Department of the East China Electric Power Engineering Company under the Electric Power Management Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the First Engineering Department), which is responsible for the construction of the plant buildings and equipment installation, has not completed this task well. Since the earthwork began in January of this year, the organizational management work and ideological education work of the First Engineering Department have been in a state of chaos. After officially starting construction on April 1, serious quality accidents occurred continuously in April and May, causing huge waste to the country.
    The main projects that the First Engineering Department started construction on in April included the following in terms of civil engineering: the main plant building, turbine foundation, boiler foundation, pump house, drainage pipe, warehouse, water tower, coal yard, and auxiliary projects such as family dormitories. In terms of installation, there was the dismantling and relocation project of a 5,000 kW generator. In the entire project, the amount of concrete work accounts for about one-quarter of the total construction and installation workload. Therefore, the quality of the concrete pouring project plays a decisive role in the quality of the entire project.
    According to the inspection results of the construction unit and the construction unit, in the column foundations of the main plant building, many columns have honeycombing, pitting, and exposed steel reinforcement. The most serious case is the exposed steel reinforcement in the dog holes of a column foundation for a traveling crane beam, which almost divided the column into two sections. In the No. 1 boiler foundation project, the position of the blower foundation was misplaced twice, requiring rework. During the rework, workers found that the concrete compaction under the steel reinforcement layer was very poor. Quality accidents occurred in all the concrete pouring areas of the water tower project. The drainage pipe leaked. During construction, phenomena such as incorrect building elevation, orientation, and dimensions were also very serious. These accidents reduced the quality of the project and delayed the construction period.
    Other wasteful phenomena are also very serious. This construction site is implementing mechanized and factory-style construction, with various types of work proceeding in a流水交叉作业 (simultaneous and overlapping manner) on the same working surface. The diversity and complexity of the project determine that it is necessary to strengthen on-site construction management and organization. However, the First Engineering Department did not do these two tasks well, resulting in a lack of coordination between different types of work, between the construction site and the processing plant, and between different processing plants. Either the construction site was shut down waiting for materials, or the processing plant was idle due to the lack of a plan from the construction site. Many construction sites lacked accurate work plans, and workers often did not know what they would be doing the next day. It was common for dozens or hundreds of workers to wait every morning to be assigned work for the day. Due to these reasons, from April to mid-May, more than 35,000 extra workdays were used in earthwork, concrete, and other engineering aspects compared to the national plan; in the steel reinforcement engineering aspect, more than 11,000 extra workdays were used compared to the national plan. Many other types of work also failed to meet the national planned quotas.
    There were more than 40 crane operators, and the work they did each day could be done by just ten people. This phenomenon of massive waste of manpower existed in every type of work. But strangely, while there were too many workers on site and their strength could not be fully utilized, the First Engineering Department also blindly recruited new workers illegally in Nanjing and other places. Overtime and idle work also existed simultaneously. For example, on one occasion, three of the four groups responsible for the construction of the pump house worked overtime for a day, while the other group was idle for a day.
    Due to design changes and repeated delays in the start of the project, many materials could not be used in construction quickly, and some of them were already surplus. The First Engineering Department did not actively inform the construction unit so that they could jointly study solutions, resulting in a large backlog. Up to now, more than 2,000 tons of cement, more than 180 tons of steel and shaped steel, and a large amount of other materials have been stockpiled.
    There was no system for the storage and use of materials. The yellow sand and gravel transported to the construction site were available for anyone to take. The main plant construction site only had about 200 light bulbs, but more than 1,000 light bulbs have been used from January to now. In some construction sites, steel bars and lead wires were scattered all over the ground.
    Financial management was also very chaotic. The administrative section built a warehouse without anyone's approval. The finance section also borrowed 400,000 yuan from the bank without anyone's approval. There were many such things, but they did not attract the attention of the leading staff.
    Why is the management work of the First Engineering Department so backward and not improved for a long time? The main reason is that the administrative leader Zhang Shengwu is arrogant and complacent. The CPC Huainan Municipal Committee discovered the chaotic construction management of this project very early on and understood that the leading construction staff did not even understand basic planning management and economic accounting, so they asked them to learn from books and newspapers, and asked them to learn from other construction units of the Huainan Coal Mine. However, Zhang Shengwu did not implement the instructions of the Municipal Committee. He did not study himself, nor did he organize other staff to study. Quality accidents in the concrete project occurred continuously in relatively less important projects such as water towers, water tanks, and drainage pipes, but Zhang Shengwu did not care, so they continued to occur in the main plant project. When others pointed out the seriousness of the continuous quality accidents, Zhang Shengwu also thought that others were "making a fuss" and that "the engineering quality is basically qualified." And the CPC Committee of the First Engineering Department did not criticize Zhang Shengwu's arrogance and complacency, nor did it conduct serious research on management work, and of course, it did not propose effective ways to improve the level of construction management work. It was not until the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee and Huainan Municipal Committee, as well as the higher-level administrative leading organs of the First Engineering Department, sent a work team to inspect and severely criticized the leadership work of the engineering department, that the CPC Committee of the First Engineering Department and Zhang Shengwu began to take some measures to improve quality and organized the masses to discuss overcoming the problem of waste. However, even now, Zhang Shengwu has not examined the causes of quality accidents and waste from the perspective of leadership ideology and style, and his arrogance has not been overcome. The workers and masses have a lot of opinions on this point. They said, of course, we workers must check carefully, but what's the use if the leaders don't check carefully?
    Now, the main project has entered a tense construction phase. The CPC Committee of the First Engineering Department should resolutely overcome the arrogance and complacency of the administrative leading staff, supervise the administration to improve construction management work, strengthen ideological education for the workers, so as to ensure the smooth completion of the construction task.

    一个工程质量低劣、浪费严重的施工单位
    本报记者　于明
    当我们听到，我国自己制造的第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机将在淮南市安装起来，并将供应大量的工业用电时，我们是多么热忱地期待发电厂的建设工作能早日完成！但是，负责厂房建筑和设备安装的电业管理总局华东电业工程公司第一工程处（以下简称第一工程处），却没有很好完成这个任务。这一工程从今年一月开始挖土工作以来，第一工程处的组织管理工作和职工的思想教育工作，一直是混乱的。四月一日正式开工以后，四、五两月份就不断发生严重的质量事故，给国家造成了巨大的浪费。
    第一工程处四月份开始施工的主要项目，土建方面有：主厂房、透平基础、锅炉基础、水泵房、排水管、仓库、水塔、煤场，还有家属宿舍等附属工程。安装方面，有五千瓩发电机的拆迁工程。在整个工程中，混凝土工作量占全部建筑、安装工作量的四分之一左右。所以混凝土浇灌工程的质量好坏，对整个工程的质量起决定性的作用。
    根据建设单位和施工单位的检查结果来看，在主厂房的柱基中，有许多柱子有蜂窝麻面和狗洞露筋，其中最严重的，是一个行车梁的柱基的狗洞露筋，它几乎把柱子分成了两截。第一号锅炉基础工程，由于把风机基础地位放错了两次，必须返工，在返工时，工人们发现在钢筋层下，混凝土的捣固很不好。水塔工程中浇灌混凝土的地方，都发生质量事故。排水管漏水。在施工中，把建筑标高、方位、尺寸搞错的现象也很严重。这些事故，降低了工程质量，也推迟了工期。
    其他的浪费现象也十分严重。这个工程现场是实行机械化和工厂化施工的，各工种都在一个工作面上进行流水交叉作业。工程的多样和复杂，就决定了必须加强施工现场的管理工作和组织工作。但是，第一工程处没有把这两个工作做好，以致造成工种同工种之间，工地同加工厂之间，以及加工厂同加工厂之间的不协调。不是工地停工待料，就是加工厂因工地无计划而窝工。许多工地由于没有准确的作业计划，工人往往今天不知道明天将干些什么。常有这种情况：几十个或几百个工人，每天早晨，都等着分配当天的工作。因为这些原因，从四月到五月中旬，挖土、混凝土等工程方面，比国家计划多用了三万五千多个工；在钢筋工程方面，比国家计划多用了一万一千多个工。其他许多工种也没有完成国家计划定额。
    起重工有四十多人，每天所做的活，只要十个人就可以了。这种大量浪费人力的现象，每一个工种都有。但奇怪的是：一方面现场里工人过多，力量不能充分发挥，另一方面第一工程处又盲目地到南京等地非法招收新工人。加班加点和窝工停工也同时存在。例如，有一次，负责水泵房施工任务的四个小组，有三个小组加了一天班，而另一个小组却窝了一天工。
    由于设计的变更和工程的一再延期开工，许多材料不能很快地用到建筑上去，其中有一部分已经多余了。第一工程处也不主动告诉建设单位，以便共同研究处理办法，所以造成大量的积压。到现在为止，水泥积压了两千多吨，钢筋、型钢等积压一百八十多吨，其他物资也积压很多。
      材料的保管和使用没有制度。运到工地的黄砂、石子，任人取用。主厂房工地只有二百盏左右的电灯，但从一月到现在，已经领用了一千多个灯泡。在有的工地里，钢筋、铅丝满地。
    财务管理工作也很乱。行政科不经任何人批准，就盖了一座仓库。财务科也不经任何人批准，就向银行借款四十万元。诸如这类的事很多，但都没有引起领导工作人员的注意。
    为什么第一工程处的管理工作这样落后而又长期不改进呢？主要的是行政领导工作人员张省吾骄傲自满。中共淮南市委很早就发现这个工程的施工管理混乱，并了解施工的领导工作人员连基本的计划管理和经济核算等都不懂，所以，要求他们从书本上、报纸上学习，要求他们向淮南煤矿的其他施工单位学习。但是，张省吾却不执行市委的指示。他自己不学习，也不组织其他工作人员学习。混凝土工程的质量事故，早就在较次要的水塔、水箱、排水管等工程中连续发生，但张省吾不在乎，所以在主厂房工程中又继续发生。当别人指出连续发生质量事故的严重性时，张省吾还认为别人“大惊小怪”，认为“工程质量基本合格”。而第一工程处的中共党委会，对张省吾的骄傲自满不开展批评，对管理工作也没进行认真的研究，当然也就没有提出有效的提高施工管理工作水平的办法。直到中共安徽省委和淮南市委以及第一工程处的上级行政领导机关派工作组来检查，并对工程处的领导工作提出严厉的批评以后，第一工程处的中共党委会和张省吾才开始采取一些改进质量的措施，组织群众讨论克服浪费问题。但是，直到现在，张省吾还没有从领导思想和作风方面检查质量事故和浪费的原因，骄气还没有克服。职工群众对这一点是很有意见的。他们说，我们工人当然要好好检查，可是领导方面不好好检查，有什么用呢？
    现在，主要工程已经进入紧张的施工阶段。第一工程处的中共党委会应该坚决地克服行政领导工作人员的骄傲自满情绪，监督行政改进施工管理工作，加强对职工进行思想教育，以保证建设任务的顺利完成。
