    Dedicate All My Strength to the Construction of the Motherland's Steel Industry
    Editor:
    I finished reading Comrade Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" with great excitement. I work at the Anshan "Second Steelmaking Construction Site." The steel plant we are building is the second of the Anshan "three new-style steel plants" mentioned in Comrade Li Fuchun's report.
    The basic construction of this steel plant was designed by the Soviet Union and constructed with the direct help of Soviet experts. After all our employees took on this task, they all felt the glory and importance of their responsibility, and everyone was highly motivated. Therefore, although the construction technology of this steel plant is complex, the workers' enthusiasm has created conditions for the early completion of the project. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, the construction is progressing rapidly, enabling all open-hearth furnaces to be put into production ahead of schedule. In addition, since the start of construction, we have also successfully completed the monthly labor productivity plan and cost reduction plan.
    Comrade Li Fuchun's report has made me further realize the importance of my current work to the country's socialist construction. In addition to ensuring that I will better complete the current construction task, I am also determined to dedicate all my strength to the construction of the motherland's steel industry and strive to establish more steel bases.

    把自己的全部力量献给祖国钢铁工业的建设工作编辑同志：
    我怀着极大的兴奋读完了李富春同志“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。我在鞍山“二炼钢工地”工作，我们正在建设的炼钢厂就是李富春同志报告中提到的鞍山“三个新式的炼钢厂”中的第二个。
    这个炼钢厂的基本建设，是由苏联设计，并在苏联专家直接帮助之下施工的。我们全体职工担任了这个任务后，都感到自己责任的光荣和重大，大家的积极性很高。因此，虽然这个炼钢厂施工技术复杂，但是工人们的热情为工程的提前完工创造了条件。由于全体职工的努力，施工进展迅速，使所有的平炉都能提前投入生产。此外，施工以来，每月的劳动生产率计划、降低成本计划，我们也都胜利地完成了。
    李富春同志的报告使我更进一步地认识了我目前担负的工作对国家社会主义建设事业的重要意义。我除了保证要更好地完成目前这项建设任务外，还决心把自己的全部力量献给祖国钢铁工业的建设工作，为建立更多的钢铁基地而奋斗。史向荣
