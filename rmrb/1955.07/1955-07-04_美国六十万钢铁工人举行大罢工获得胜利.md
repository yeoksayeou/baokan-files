Xinhua News Agency report: According to American news agency reports, 600,000 American steel workers began a twelve-hour general strike from midnight on June 30th. The reason for the strike was the failure to reach an agreement in the new contract negotiations between the United Steelworkers of America and the United States Steel Corporation after the final deadline expired. In view of the enormous scale of the strike and the workers' determination to persist in the strike, the United States Steel Corporation quickly reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers of America on a new contract after the strike broke out. The new contract specifically stipulated wage increases. A few hours later, six other major steel companies also agreed to the terms of the new contract, and the strike ended victoriously.

Xinhua News Agency report: According to a United Press report, 50,000 American non-ferrous metal smelter workers belonging to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers went on strike on July 1st to protest the employer's rejection of the union's demand for wage increases. This strike is the largest in the American non-ferrous metal industry since 1951, and it has paralyzed non-ferrous metal smelting enterprises in sixteen American states. This strike is still ongoing.

　　美国六十万钢铁工人举行大罢工获得胜利
    据新华社讯　据美国通讯社消息，美国六十万钢铁工人从六月三十日午夜开始举行了十二小时的大罢工，罢工原因是联合钢铁工人工会同美国钢铁公司进行的新合同谈判在最后限期终了后未能达成协议。鉴于罢工规模的巨大和工人们准备坚持罢工的决心，美国钢铁公司在罢工爆发后很快同联合钢铁工人工会就新合同达成了协议，新合同中特别规定了提高工资，在几小时后，另外六家大钢铁公司也同意了新合同的条件，罢工因而胜利结束。
    据新华社讯　据合众社报道，属于国际开采冶炼工人工会的五万名美国有色金属冶炼工人在七月一日举行罢工，抗议资方拒绝工会关于提高工资的要求。这次罢工是一九五一年以来在美国有色金属工业中规模最大的一次罢工，罢工已经使美国十六个州的有色金属冶炼企业处于瘫痪状态。这一罢工仍在坚持中。
