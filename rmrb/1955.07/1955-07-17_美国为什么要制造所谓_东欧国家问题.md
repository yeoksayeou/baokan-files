Why is the United States Creating the So-Called "Eastern European Question"?
Su Xin

As the United States, under the pressure of world public opinion, agreed to hold a summit conference of the four major powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, the government and congressional figures of the United States, as well as the bourgeois press, have extensively disseminated pessimistic views about the upcoming conference and repeatedly clamored about the so-called "Eastern European Question." U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at a press conference held in Washington on June 29, also reiterated that the United States would continue to try to change the existing political and social systems in these countries, thereby openly encouraging external interference in the internal affairs of these countries. Subsequently, the U.S. Senate passed a proposal clearly aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of countries whose people have already been liberated, and provoking international hatred and suspicion. According to U.S. Senator Nolan, when introducing the proposal, he announced that his proposal was put forward with Eisenhower's "full approval."

At a time when people around the world are eagerly expecting the Four Powers Conference to be held smoothly and reach agreements, so as to make an effective contribution to easing international tensions, this approach by the United States is clearly intended to poison the international atmosphere and create obstacles to the Four Powers Conference.

The so-called "Eastern European Question" does not actually exist; it only exists in the "Cold War" policy of the United States. The purpose of the United States in creating this problem is to overthrow the system chosen by the people of Eastern European countries themselves and restore capitalist rule there.

Before World War II, the Eastern European countries had always been used by Western imperialist countries to serve their aggressive policies. After the failure of the international imperialist armed intervention against the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, the United States tried its best to prevent the victory of the Soviet revolution from influencing Europe. Western countries used money and guns to suppress the surging people's revolutionary movements in Eastern European countries at that time, supported the anti-people forces in these countries to establish a reign of terror, and then turned the entire Eastern Europe into an anti-Soviet front line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

At the same time, the monopoly capital forces of Western countries massively penetrated Eastern European countries. On the eve of World War II, foreign capital controlled almost all of the industry and the lifeline of the national economy of Eastern European countries. They controlled 90 percent of the shares of large industrial enterprises in Poland, more than 91 percent of the oil industry in Romania, about half of the industrial investment in Hungary and Bulgaria, and more than two-thirds of the industrial and mining investment in Albania. American monopoly capital, in collusion with the monopoly capital of Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries, carried out brutal plunder in these countries, extracting exorbitant profits.

However, the era of imperialist domination in Eastern European countries was permanently ended by the liberated people of Eastern European countries after the collapse of Hitler's fascism.

More than a decade ago, the people of Eastern European countries resolutely abandoned the capitalist system and independently chose the people's democratic system that conformed to their wishes and interests. Over the years, Eastern European countries have developed into independent, autonomous, prosperous, and flourishing countries. Today, they are no longer subject to the exploitation and plunder of Western imperialism, no longer look to the whims of the tycoons of Wall Street and London, and are no longer loose change in the shameful transactions of Western countries. They no longer serve as pawns in imperialist aggression, but have become an important force against imperialist war conspiracies.

The imperialists are unwilling to admit this fundamental change in Eastern Europe and do not recognize the right of the people of Eastern Europe to choose their own social system and decide their own destiny. They are unwilling to give up their lost imperialist privileges in Eastern European countries. This is the real reason why the U.S. ruling clique is preoccupied with changing the political and social systems chosen by the people of Eastern European countries themselves.

U.S. officials have been clamoring to change the social system of Eastern European countries for years. The Democratic and Republican parties in the United States have included this point in their campaign platforms, and the U.S. government has also made overthrowing the legitimate governments of today's Eastern European sovereign states its policy goal. After the failure of instigating open counter-revolutionary coups in Eastern European countries, the U.S. ruling clique used dollars to collect a large number of reactionary politicians, traitors, scoundrels, murderers, and fascists who had fled from these countries, in order to use them to serve their despicable purposes. According to Lausman, the former leader of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party who returned home and surrendered in May 1954, "The vast majority of exiles, especially the so-called political representatives, serve the interests of foreign groups. They sell themselves for American money and engage in espionage, terror, sabotage, and slander activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies." Just as the U.S. propaganda machine was creating the so-called "Eastern European Question" to sabotage the atmosphere of the great power conference, a group of Eastern European countries' traitors and exiles, subsidized and sheltered by Western countries, recently held a meeting in Strasbourg. Following the typical Washington tune, they staged a farce against the so-called "enslavement" of Eastern European countries.

As everyone knows, in October 1951, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that blatantly stipulated a special appropriation of $100 million to fund "residents in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and any specially selected personnel, or personnel who have escaped from these countries... to form them into armed forces supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or for other purposes."

Since then, the U.S. has intensified its sabotage against Eastern European democratic countries. According to "U.S. News & World Report," published on May 27 this year, Washington is currently studying a report of about 20,000 words submitted by David Sarnoff, chairman of the "Radio Corporation of America." This report outlines a broad plan for carrying out destructive activities against peaceful democratic countries. These include: carrying out defamatory propaganda, funding bandits to create armed riots, recruiting traitorous exiles, training spies, and so on. At the same time, the Hoover Commission, responsible for studying the reorganization of U.S. government agencies, submitted a report to Congress, nakedly advocating strengthening espionage activities against peaceful democratic and socialist countries. Just recently, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania successively uncovered espionage cases related to foreign countries. These cases show that the international imperialist forces, headed by the United States, harbor bitter hatred for the liberated people. They painstakingly want to put these countries back under their rule, to be manipulated and exploited by them. The so-called "Eastern European Question" is precisely a smokescreen created by U.S. imperialism to cover up its sinister intentions and related activities.

However, no matter how much the United States gnaws its teeth at the Eastern European people's democratic countries, the people of Eastern European countries are firmly advancing along the path they have chosen and solemnly responding to the imperialists' attempts to interfere in their internal affairs. Czechoslovak Premier Široký has announced to the world: "To those official spokesmen of Western countries who seem to have lost all respect for national sovereignty and national rights, our answer is: The people of Czechoslovakia have definitely solved the problem of their national sovereignty and their national freedom, and they absolutely do not want to experience the freedom of exploitation, the rule of the strong oppressing the weak, and they will never again see the proud banner of their national and national independence trampled on." What has happened in Czechoslovakia has also happened in other Eastern European people's democratic countries. Whether the U.S. ruling clique likes it or not, this fact cannot be changed by any evil force.

    美国为什么要制造所谓“东欧国家问题”
    苏新
    在美国因迫于世界舆论的压力而同意举行苏美英法四大国首脑会议以后，美国的政府和议会人士以及资产阶级的报刊就大量地散布关于即将召开的这个会议的悲观空气，同时一再叫嚣所谓“东欧国家问题”。美国总统艾森豪威尔六月二十九日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上，也重复表示美国要继续设法改变这些国家中的现行政治和社会制度，从而公开鼓励了从外面对这些国家的内政进行干涉。接着，美国参议院通过了一项显然旨在干涉人民已获解放的国家的内政、挑拨国际仇恨和猜疑的提案。据美国参议员诺兰在提出提案时宣布，他这个提案是在艾森豪威尔的“完全赞同”下提出来的。
    当全世界人民迫切地期待着四大国会议能够顺利召开并取得协议，以便对缓和国际紧张局势作出有效贡献的时候，美国的这种做法明明是想毒化国际气氛，给四大国会议设置障碍。
    所谓“东欧国家问题”实际上是并不存在的，它只是存在在美国的“冷战”政策中。美国制造这个问题的目的，就是想推翻东欧各国人民自己选择的制度，在那里恢复资本主义的统治。
    在第二次世界大战以前，东欧各国一直是被西方帝国主义国家利用来为它们的侵略政策服务的。在二十年代初国际帝国主义对苏联的武装干涉失败后，美国曾竭力防止苏联革命的胜利对欧洲的影响。西方国家以金元和枪弹镇压了当时在东欧各国风起云涌的人民革命运动，扶植这些国家的反人民的势力建立恐怖统治，而后把整个东欧变成为一道从波罗的海到黑海的反苏前沿阵地。
    与此同时，西方国家的垄断资本势力大量渗入东欧国家。在第二次世界大战前夕，外国资本几乎掌握着东欧各国绝大部分的工业和国民经济命脉。它们掌握了波兰大工业企业股票的百分之九十，罗马尼亚石油工业的百分之九十一以上，匈牙利和保加利亚工业投资的一半左右，阿尔巴尼亚工矿投资的三分之二以上。美国垄断资本同英、法、德、比等国的垄断资本勾结一起，在这些国家进行残酷的掠夺，榨取超额的利润。
    但是，帝国主义在东欧国家作威作福的时代在希特勒法西斯溃灭以后，就被东欧各国解放了的人民永远结束了。
    东欧各国人民在十多年以前坚决地摈弃了资本主义制度，而自行选择了符合于他们愿望和利益的人民民主制度。这些年来，东欧各国已发展成为独立、自主和繁荣、兴盛的国家了。今天它们不再受西方帝国主义的剥削和掠夺，不再仰承华尔街和伦敦的大亨们的鼻息，不再是西方国家进行可耻交易的零头。它们不再充当帝国主义侵略的走卒，而成为反对帝国主义战争阴谋的重要力量了。
    帝国主义者不愿意承认东欧的这种根本性的变化，不承认东欧人民有自己选择社会制度、自己决定命运的权利。它们不甘心放弃它们已经失去的在东欧国家的帝国主义特权。这就是美国统治集团念念不忘的急于要改变东欧国家人民自己选择的政治和社会制度的真正原因。
    美国的官方人士，这些年来一直在叫嚷要改变东欧国家的社会制度。美国的民主党和共和党把这
  一点列入自己的竞选纲领，而美国政府也把推翻今天东欧主权国家的合法政府作为自己的政策目标。在东欧各国策动公开的反革命政变失败以后，美国统治集团就用美元收罗了从这些国家逃亡出来的大批反动政客、叛徒、败类、杀人犯和法西斯分子，以便利用他们来为自己的卑鄙目的服务。据回国自首的捷克斯洛伐克前社会民主党领袖劳斯曼在一九五四年五月说，“绝大多数亡命者，尤其是所谓政治上的代表人物，都是为外国利益集团服务的。他们为了得到美国人的金钱而出卖自己，去从事反对苏联和各人民民主国家的间谍、恐怖、破坏和诬蔑活动。”就在美国宣传机器制造所谓“东欧国家问题”来破坏大国会议气氛的时候，得到西方国家津贴和庇护的一批东欧国家的背叛祖国的亡命之徒最近在斯特拉斯堡举行会议。他们按照典型的华盛顿曲调，搬演了反对东欧国家的所谓“被奴役”的滑稽剧。
    大家知道，一九五一年十月，美国国会曾通过法案，赤裸裸地规定特别拨款一亿美元来资助“居住在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和任何特别挑选的人员，或是从这些国家逃出的人员，……把他们组成支持北大西洋公约组织的武装部队的队伍，或用于其他目的”。
    从那时以来，美国对东欧民主国家的破坏一直是有加无已。据今年五月二十七日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，华盛顿目前正在研究由“美国广播公司”董事长大卫·沙诺夫所提出的长达二万字左右的报告。这个报告拟订了对和平民主国家进行破坏活动的广泛计划。其中包括：进行诽谤造谣的宣传，资助匪徒制造武装骚乱，收罗叛徒流亡分子，训练间谍人员等等。同时，负责研究美国政府机构改组工作的胡佛委员会向国会提出了一个报告，赤裸裸地主张加强对和平民主和社会主义国家的间谍活动。就在最近，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚接连破获了和外国有关的间谍特务案件。这些案件表明，以美国为首的国际帝国主义势力怀着对于获得了解放的人民的切齿痛恨。它处心积虑地要把这些国家重新置于它们的统治之下，由它来摆布和剥削。所谓“东欧国家问题”，也正是美帝国主义制造出来掩盖自己这一罪恶意图和有关活动的烟幕。
    但是，不管美国对东欧人民民主国家是多么地咬牙切齿，东欧国家人民却坚定地沿着他们自己所选择的道路前进，并且庄严地回答帝国主义者干涉他们内政的企图。捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基已经向全世界宣告：“对于那些看来已经丝毫不再尊重国家主权和民族权利的西方国家的官方发言人，我们的回答是：捷克斯洛伐克人民已经肯定地解决了它的国家主权和它的民族自由问题，它绝对不愿再来身受剥削的自由、强者压迫弱者的统治，也决不愿意再看到它的国家和民族独立的自豪的旗帜受到糟踏。”在捷克斯洛伐克已经发生的事实，也是在东欧其他人民民主国家发生的事实。不管美国统治集团喜欢不喜欢，这个事实是任何邪恶势力所不能改变的。
