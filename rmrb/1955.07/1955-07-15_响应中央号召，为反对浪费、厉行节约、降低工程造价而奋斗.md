Responding to the Central Call, Striving to Oppose Waste, Practice Thrift, and Reduce Project Costs
Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan

    In order to implement the Central Committee's instructions on practicing thrift and reducing costs, we spent more than a month in the second quarter of this year inspecting the new railway construction work in the Southwest and Northwest regions. At the beginning of the inspection, the leaders and staff of various units lacked confidence in completing the task of reducing costs. The Northwest Design Bureau proposed that the Bao-Lüe section design could only reduce costs by 0.8%, and the First and Sixth Engineering Bureaus also proposed that they could only reduce project costs by 6%. After the inspection, the phenomenon of waste in the project was exposed, and after pointing out ways to reduce costs, the confidence of on-site leaders and staff was greatly enhanced. They unanimously believed that the Central Committee's decision to practice thrift and reduce costs was correct, timely, and achievable.
    After inspection, it was found that the waste in railway basic construction projects is quite serious.
    Waste is first manifested in blindly raising standards, especially in many non-productive buildings. What should be small is made large, what should be little is made much, and what should be low is made high. Many station buildings are too large, even making way stations build 150 square meters of housing. There are too many toilets at stations, and the construction unit price is too high. The cost of toilets on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is as high as 135 yuan per square meter. In some places, such as Mianyang Station, the cost is as high as 298 yuan, which is four times the local housing construction unit price. The cost of dormitories is also too high, and the area occupied per household is too large. For example, the average construction cost of houses in the Chengdu construction department base is 73 yuan per square meter. It seems lower in cost and better in quality than other regions, but the cost of materials and labor in Chengdu is cheap, and the new residential buildings in Chengdu are only 18 yuan per square meter. Therefore, our housing construction standards are still high. The dormitories in the Guangyuan and Majiaoba areas of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway occupy an area of ​​81 square meters per household. The construction unit price of many temporary sheds is as high as 40 yuan per square meter, nominally "temporary," but actually usable for 15 to 20 years.
    There are also practices of blindly raising standards in productive construction. For example, the seven pairs of communication lines on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway only need one pair of copper wires, but we used five pairs of copper wires, and even used copper wires for token machines, seriously wasting the nation's non-ferrous metals.
    Secondly, some projects seem to belong to productive construction, but are not necessary in the initial stage of transportation operations. These premature investments are essentially a waste. Many new railways have opened many stations that are completely unnecessary in the initial stage of transportation operations, and some stations have too many tracks laid. According to transportation operation needs, Mianyang Station only needs six tracks, but as many as seventeen tracks were laid. Many stations have only dozens of passengers getting on and off every day, but two or three platforms have been built, and some are even longer than the platforms of Shanghai Station. In terms of superstructure construction on the line, the main line only needs to lay 1,600 sleepers per kilometer in the initial stage of transportation operations, but regardless of the amount of transportation, we lay 1,840 sleepers per kilometer; the thickness of the ballast only needs to be 35 cm, but we lay it at 45 cm or more. These premature investments not only disperse the country's construction funds and affect the progress of economic construction, but also increase depreciation, major repairs, and regular maintenance costs.
    Thirdly, blindly pursuing form and adding many unnecessary projects cause waste. The buildings along the line could have used the natural terrain without the need for a large amount of earthwork, but our designers, in order to pursue beauty, insisted on putting them on the same level or a certain design elevation, doing a lot of unnecessary earthwork, resulting in great waste. Ninety percent of the stations on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have done high filling to level with the roadbed, and now they have to wait for the filling to settle before building houses, which not only wastes earthwork but also affects the progress of the project. Blindly pursuing form is also reflected in unnecessary decorations for many buildings. In the Mianyang-Guangyuan section, the eaves of all buildings, whether dormitories, schools, or even locomotive depots, are decorated with lace, painted in color, and have cloud-shaped corbels, and even the chimneys are inlaid and painted, making them colorful. The office building of the Lanzhou Design Branch is fitted with a large roof, glazed tiles, painted with patterns, and has celestial beings and mythical beasts on the roof ridge. The design budget for the construction of the building also includes luxury equipment such as steel wire recorders, nine-tube radios, and record players. Formalism is also manifested in adding many completely unnecessary projects and equipment. For example, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has a sparse population along the line, and some areas have no inhabitants for hundreds of kilometers, but we have built guard houses at the crossings and sent crossing guards. Every five kilometers between Lanzhou and Wuwei, a patrolman's shift exchange room is built, most of which are empty and uninhabited. Many stations, even in uninhabited places, have hundreds of meters of painted fences installed. Many small bridges are also fitted with iron railings on both sides, and large bridge number signs are inserted at both ends of the bridge. All bridges and culverts on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have concrete inspection ladders built on both sides. All of these are unnecessary.
    In addition, waste caused by design technical errors is also serious, and also causes unreasonable phenomena in use. The design of many stations lacks overall consideration, and the layout is very unreasonable. Many stations on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway face away from residential areas, and passengers must cross all the tracks of the station to get to the platform and then to the waiting room, which seriously affects passenger safety and shunting operations. The Anchangjiang Bridge on the Mianyang-Guangyuan section, due to design technical errors and improper bridge site selection, has spent two and a half times the cost of the bridge on flood control in the past three years, and now a new bridge has to be built.
    In terms of construction, many comprehensive construction sites lack an overall construction plan, causing mutual interference between construction units. For example, at Lüeyang Station, there are mechanical road construction teams and housing construction teams. Because the processes are not uniformly arranged, the places where the mechanical road construction team discards soil will have to be excavated by the housing construction team during construction. Due to insufficient estimation of the allocation of manpower for operation and maintenance of machinery, the connection between various processes, and the storage of fuel, the waste in the use of machinery is also very serious. For example, the actual utilization rate of machinery in the Sixth Engineering Bureau from April to November 1954 was only 8.6%. The waste of labor is also very serious. In the first quarter, the labor productivity of bridge and culvert projects in the First Engineering Bureau was only 50% of the plan, and losses due to absenteeism, leave, and transfer amounted to 70,000 workdays, and auxiliary wages exceeded the budget by 200,000 yuan. The bureau currently has 26,000 basic workers, but non-production personnel number as many as 8,000. The construction plant engineering company has an average of 2.6 production personnel matched with one management personnel (excluding temporary workers). Failure to pay attention to using local materials and taking the near for the far is also very serious. Many of the Sixth Engineering Bureau's stones are quarried at the foot of the mountain and transported to the mountain, while the large amount of rock excavated on the mountain has no place to be discarded, and even interferes with construction. The Weihe construction site does not use Weihe pebbles, but transports them from Qingjiang River, more than ten kilometers away. The Lüeyang construction site quarries stone in the Guangyuan area of ​​the lower reaches of the Jialing River, more than 100 kilometers away, and drags it upstream, while the stone in Heyeba in the upper reaches is discarded. For example, ballast costs 14 yuan per cubic meter, and river pebbles only cost 3 yuan per cubic meter. Therefore, paving the roadbed with pebbles is much cheaper than ballast, but we rarely use it. Although some places have used it, they blindly stipulated that the pebbles should be crushed before use, resulting in a waste of three man-days per cubic meter and a waste of 5,000 man-days per kilometer.
    What are the main reasons for the above waste?
    First of all, it is because the leaders and staff at all levels of the Ministry of Railways, from the ministry to the grassroots units, have insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of socialist construction, and insufficient understanding that practicing thrift and opposing waste is a long-term political task, which has led to many project standards deviating from realistic conditions and actual needs. For example, many of the design standards for superstructure construction and bridges and culverts are copied from Soviet design standards. We have neither studied the development process of Soviet design standards well, nor have we seriously investigated and analyzed China's specific situation and transportation needs, and we have mechanically transported them regardless of the actual situation. As a result, a large amount of national funds has been used in many unnecessary projects!
    Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of the principle of focusing on key construction, which has led to many aspects of work violating the principle of key investment, failing to distinguish between productive construction and non-productive construction, and even reversing the priorities, disregarding transportation needs, and using the country's limited funds for projects that are not needed in the short term. This is an error in policy, and the leadership of the Ministry of Railways must bear the main responsibility. For example, on the Mianyang-Guangyuan section and the Lanzhou-Wuwei section, which are about to be delivered for operation, many facilities directly related to train operation are not yet complete. Some stations have not installed lighting equipment, and there are no signaling devices north of Majiaoba and west of Dachaigou. Anti-climbing devices and guard rails have not been installed on the line, and water supply equipment has not been built. The maintenance equipment for locomotives and vehicles is not yet complete. There are many places where money should have been spent but has not been spent or has not been spent enough, but dormitories, elementary schools, and other non-productive houses have been built first.
    Thirdly, a clear distinction was not made between current needs and future needs when using investment. Some projects, although belonging to productive construction, are not needed in the initial stage of transportation operations when the traffic volume is not large, and should not be invested in. Premature construction will inevitably put a part of the country's funds in a long-term stagnant state. This, in addition to wasting national funds, has no positive effect on production.
    Finally, there is a lack of economic accounting thinking. The staff of the design department and the construction department rarely pay attention to strengthening economic viewpoints and implementing the principle of thrift in their work; they only care about the project and do not hesitate to spend money. For example, sometimes decisions are easily made and designs are blindly carried out and handed over to construction without complete and accurate survey data. Some engineering and technical personnel have serious formalism and individualism. When they start designing, they often do not pay attention to how to implement the principle of "applicable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions," but blindly pursue formal beauty, as if only in this way can they demonstrate their talents. In the past few years, the losses caused to the country by this error have been great.
    The above-mentioned shortcomings and erroneous ideological manifestations are subjectivism, formalism, liberalism, and dogmatism. Their common point is that they do not proceed from reality, do not proceed from objective circumstances, and in terms of their ideological essence, they are all idealistic things. For several years, due to the low leadership level of the Ministry of Railways, insufficient understanding of the seriousness of these erroneous ideas, and failure to promptly check and expose these wasteful phenomena and conduct a serious struggle against them; although some wasteful phenomena were eliminated in the past inspection work and reasonable standards were proposed, they were not adhered to and promoted, so that these erroneous ideas still exist. For example, in 1952, we went to the Southwest region to inspect railway work and found that the station area of ​​Chengdu Station was too large. We decided to reduce it from more than 7,000 mu to 4,000 mu. The Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory originally occupied 25 kilometers, but was later reduced to 5 kilometers. It was enough to build two platforms at Chongqing Station, but five were planned. When we inspected, two and a half had already been built, and we immediately stopped further construction. In 1953, we went to the Northwest to inspect the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway project and also pointed out that too many and too good toilets were being built. This is in line with the concept of thrift, but we failed to adhere to this concept of thrift. In 1952, the cost of housing built by the Tianjin Railway Administration was 34.6 yuan per square meter, which is basically suitable for China's current economic situation, and therefore is relatively reasonable. However, not all staff recognized this at the time. Some people thought it was too low. Although we had waged a struggle against this erroneous idea and issued instructions requiring the national railways to promote it, and had organized the heads of the engineering departments of various bureaus to go to the Tianjin site for learning, and some administrations such as the Beijing, Zhengzhou, and Jinan Railway Bureaus had implemented it, due to our insufficient understanding of this issue, we failed to persevere to the end with a tenacious fighting spirit. In the end, the idea of ​​extravagance and waste and blindly raising standards prevailed, and reasonable standards failed to be fully implemented, causing serious waste. These must be taken as lessons learned.
    In order to overcome waste, practice thrift, and reduce project costs, the leading organs of the Ministry of Railways have formulated 60 measures after discussion and research. These measures can be summarized into the following parts:
    1. Cancel unnecessary investment. In the new line project, after inspection, it was found that there are ten kinds of projects that must be resolutely cancelled, including: cancelling bridge number signs and writing bridge numbers on bridge platforms; cancelling inspection ladders on both sides of bridges and culverts and replacing them with earth steps and reducing their number; cancelling patrolmen's shift exchange rooms; cancelling railway boundary markers in places without farmland; cancelling guard rails on small bridges; at small stations, passing stations, and intermediate stations, because there are not many passengers, platform walls, fences, and ticket inspection booths can be cancelled. In addition, it is stipulated that temporary houses are not allowed to purchase land, but to rent land; when the tunnel is dry or the drainage is good, the bottom can be not paved. When designing the slope of the roadbed in hard rock or loess sections, the platform should be cancelled to save excavation.
    2. Cancel premature investment. In the past, we did a lot of projects too early, which dispersed the use of funds, especially in the new railways, this aspect of waste is serious. After review and calculation, at least the following investments can be reduced in the initial stage of transportation operations. For example, the number of sleepers was originally set at 1,840 per kilometer on the main line, but it can be reduced to 1,600, which can save 3.36 million yuan per thousand kilometers; the thickness of the ballast can be reduced from the original 45 cm to 35 cm, which can save 5.6 million yuan per thousand kilometers; there are too many houses, and the original 600 square meters of formal houses per kilometer can be reduced to 500 square meters, which can save 10 million yuan per thousand kilometers.
    In the initial stage of transportation operations, stations should be set up strictly according to traffic needs. Small stations generally have two tracks, and some can have three tracks according to the needs of passing trains; all construction should be mainly to meet transportation needs, and permanent cultural and welfare buildings should be built in stages; no crossing guard houses should be built at crossings that do not need guarding, especially in the sparsely populated Northwest, even crossings intersecting with highways can be temporarily not set up.
    Based on the principle of distinguishing between current needs and future needs, the Ministry of Railways has reconsidered economic survey data, partially improved existing equipment, and increased throughput capacity, thus postponing the construction of the double track from Shacheng to Datong and the double track from Shijiazhuang to Yangquan, saving an investment of about 100 million yuan, and cancelling the Luopo line reconstruction project of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which does not need investment at present, saving 5 million yuan.
    3. Change design standards. In the past, we blindly raised design standards in terms of lines, bridges, tunnels, and houses, which was one of the important reasons for serious waste, and we must appropriately lower them in the future.
    In the line design, pebbles should be used as much as possible for the roadbed, and it is stipulated that except for curves, turnouts, and bridges, all pebbles used should be screened and not crushed, which can save 3.2 million yuan per thousand kilometers; it is required that the width of the roadbed and all branch lines of non-main line railways should be reduced to 4.5 or 5 meters depending on the soil quality; new steel rails are prohibited from being used for temporary connecting lines, branch lines, crossings, and guard rails of bridges.
    In the bridge design, it is required that small bridges should not have railings, and only wooden single-sided railings are allowed to be set on larger bridges, which can save 90,000 yuan per thousand kilometers; the foundation of bridge piers that do not freeze or are not subject to scouring can use lower-grade No. 110 concrete and can be mixed with rubble.
    In tunnel design, the stone used for the side wall lining should be replaced with rubble; tunnels with hard rock can be unlined.
    In housing design, attention should be paid to using local materials. Temporary houses should be built as little as possible, and the unit price of their construction should not exceed 10 yuan per square meter. If calculated according to the original regulation of 40 yuan per square meter, 500 square meters per kilometer, an investment of 15 million yuan can be saved per thousand kilometers. The standard of formal houses should also be lowered, and the unit price per square meter is not allowed to exceed the central government's regulations.
    4. Adjust the design budget. In the past, we lacked a spirit of careful calculation, and the design budget was made too high and too large, causing great waste. For example, we have a large number of tunnel supports listed in the design budget, and a reserve of supports amounting to 2.5 times the amount of consumption. In the future, only the amount of consumption should be listed, and no reserve should be listed. The labor production quota for open-cut loose stone specified in our design budget is lower than the quota for tunneling, resulting in the wages of earth and stone workers exceeding the wages of tunnel workers, which is unreasonable and should be adjusted.
    When making design budgets, we rarely consider using natural terrain and using local materials, which increases transportation costs and many unnecessary projects. Therefore, we must re-examine the design regulations and design charts, examine the extent to which lines and buildings utilize the terrain, conduct construction organization surveys, make full use of local materials, and avoid transporting from the foot of the mountain to the mountain as much as possible, and transporting water upstream.
    In order to reduce non-production expenses, the cost of furniture in formal houses will be reduced from the original 7% of the housing cost to 3.5%; medical and health expenses and supervision fees should also be reduced.
    5. Improve design technology. Design technical errors are also one of the main reasons for waste. Therefore, the location of station refuge lines and the distribution of locomotive traffic patterns must be re-examined. Where possible, the refuge line should be located at the end of the station, which can greatly reduce the length of the refuge line; the locomotive traffic pattern should be made to reach the standard length. These can reduce investment and increase the convenience of transportation operations.
    In order to avoid the double cost of building temporary water supply and formal water supply, we should strengthen the survey, design, and construction of formal water sources, so that temporary water supply becomes a component of formal water supply.
    In addition, the basic method for processing the facing stones of bridges and the facing stones of tunnel portals should be to use roughly chiseled stones that only chisel the edges, and should not be chiseled into six-sided smooth or five-sided smooth; in places with better stone quality, the lining thickness of tunnels can also be thinned, and may even be unlined.
    6. Improve construction organization. Disorganized construction, insufficient coordination between relevant departments, and poor management and use of machinery and materials are also one of the main reasons for high project costs and large waste. In the future, we must overcome these shortcomings, strengthen the cooperation and collaboration between the basic construction, design, and construction departments, make good construction arrangements, and each construction site must have a unified construction organization design and a unified construction leadership; in terms of using trucks to transport materials, we should make full use of the capacity of trucks, increase trailers for heavy vehicles, and establish close contact with the local area to use empty trips to load local materials, or adopt empty vehicle coupling (one pulling one) to save fuel; try to load fully, reduce empty rate, and increase turnover rate to save transportation costs. We must actively promote advanced working methods, such as large blasting, water-air drills, and small mechanization, and promote piece-rate wages, strengthen labor organization, to save labor costs and improve labor productivity; strengthen machinery and material management, conscientiously do material testing, and increase the number of times that support wood, model boards, and scaffolding are used to save machinery usage fees and material costs.
    In addition, we must streamline institutions, reduce staffing, and greatly reduce non-production personnel to save expenses. It is required to delineate the scope of responsibilities and working relationships of each unit, and adopt the method of determining the organization first and then the personnel, and resolutely cut and merge all dispensable and redundant institutions. All units, especially leading staff, should develop a hard-working and simple style, and should practice thrift not only in large aspects, but also in small aspects, such as office supplies and water and electricity should be saved; in addition to boiled water, no cigarettes, fruits, snacks, or receptions should be provided at meetings, or banquets or dinners should be held; except for entertaining foreign guests, no banquets or dinners are allowed.
    In order to implement the above measures, the Ministry of Railways has begun to revise the design regulations, revise various standard designs, and organize forces to revise the design documents of several projects that have already started. This work is arduous, but it must be resolutely completed.
    Conscientiously implementing the above measures will inevitably greatly reduce project costs. According to the 60 measures mentioned above, there are 15 measures that can estimate the number of savings. Every thousand kilometers can reduce the investment by more than 63.8 million yuan, which is equivalent to more than 10% of the total investment of 1,000 kilometers. Among them, three non-production constructions, such as reducing the number of buildings and reducing their cost, can save 50 million yuan, which is nearly 80% of the total savings of 15 items. It can be seen that the focus of our savings is to combine with China's current economic situation, greatly reduce the expenditure on non-productive construction, and in addition, for productive construction, we should also reduce the cost as much as possible on the premise of ensuring quality according to the principle of thrift, and adopt the method of phased investment according to the national transportation needs to reduce the premature investment.
    According to the above measures, the amount of railway basic construction work from 1955 to 1957 is calculated. The three-year average is 26.9% lower than the original planned total investment (excluding steel frames). In 1955 alone, the country can save 173.99 million yuan. This amount can be used to build 340 kilometers of new railways.
    Mobilizing the masses to earnestly study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carry out the struggle of practicing thrift and opposing waste is an important means to complete the task of reducing costs and reducing transportation and industrial costs. Therefore, we must implement an extremely strict system of thrift in all aspects, and widely mobilize the masses to expose all kinds of wasteful phenomena and fight to eliminate all kinds of waste.
    In completing this year's task of reducing costs, we must pay attention to safe production, and we should have long-term plans, and resolutely oppose the idea and style of only caring about the present and not caring about the future. It is required that the design work should not only combine with the current situation, but also consider the future development, and the overall design should be carried out in stages. At the same time, a strict system of thrift must be established on the basis of ensuring quality. The quality of the project must meet the design requirements and must be guaranteed to be good at any time and under any standards.
    In completing the national construction task, we must also constantly improve the political and ideological level of all employees, strengthen security work, and constantly improve the class consciousness of employees. We must remove all the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in our ranks before we can engage in construction with peace of mind.
    In short, to carry out basic construction work, we must have an economic point of view, and at the same time, we must ensure quality, ensure safety, and grasp the progress, in order to comprehensively complete the national task.
    In addition to reducing project costs, the goal of the national railway staff in 1955 is to reduce railway transportation costs by 1.05% compared with the original plan according to the principle of thrift, reduce major repair project costs by 4%, and reduce auxiliary business costs by 2%. Strive to over fulfill.
    1955 is the third year of China's first five-year plan construction. Completing this year's task is of decisive significance for completing the country's first five-year plan. Under the leadership of the Party, the national railway staff must work hard to learn from the Soviet experience, guard against arrogance and rashness, work hard, overcome all non-working-class ideas, oppose waste, practice thrift, and strive to complete this year's basic construction plan with good quality, reduce costs, reduce transportation and industrial costs, save construction funds for the country, and accelerate socialist construction.

    响应中央号召，为反对浪费、厉行节约、降低工程造价而奋斗
    铁道部长  滕代远
    为了贯彻中央关于厉行节约降低造价的指示，我们在今年第二季以一个多月的时间，检查了西南、西北地区的新建铁路工作。检查开始时，各单位领导工作人员对于完成降低造价的任务是缺乏信心的。西北设计分局提出宝略段设计只能降低造价百分之零点八，第一及第六工程局也提出只能降低工程造价百分之六。经过检查，揭发了工程中的浪费现象并指出了降低造价的办法之后，现场领导工作人员的信心大为提高，一致认为中央厉行节约降低造价的决定是正确的、及时的、而且是可以做到的。
    经过检查，发现目前铁路基本建设工程中的浪费现象是相当严重的。
    浪费现象首先表现在盲目提高标准，特别是很多非生产性的建筑，该小的做大了，该少的做多了，该低的做高了。许多车站的房屋过大，甚至会让站也修一百五十平方公尺的房屋。车站的厕所太多，建筑单价过高，宝成线厕所每平方公尺造价竟达一百三十五元，其中个别地方如绵阳车站的厕所高达二百九十八元，超过当地房屋建筑单价四倍。宿舍的造价也过高，每户的占用面积过大。如成都施工部门基地的房屋建筑造价平均每平方公尺达七十三元，看来比其他地区造价低、质量也较好，但成都地区工料便宜，成都市新建居民住宅每平方公尺仅十八元，因此我们的房屋建筑标准还是高的。宝成线广元、马角坝一带的宿舍，每户占用面积达八十一平方公尺。很多临时工棚的建筑单价每平方公尺也高达四十元之多，名为“临时”，实际可用十五至二十年。
    在生产性建设方面也有盲目提高标准的做法。如成渝线的七对通信线，用一对铜线就可以了，而我们却用了五对铜线，甚至连路签机也用铜线，严重浪费了国家的有色金属。
    其次，有些工程看来虽属于生产性的建设，但在运输营业初期并没有必要，这些过早的投资，实质上也是浪费。有些新建铁路上开设了很多在运输营业初期完全没有必要的车站，而且有些车站的股道铺多了。根据运输营业需要，绵阳站只要六股道，竟铺了十七股之多。许多车站，每天只有几十个旅客上下，而站台却修了两三个，有的竟比上海车站的站台还长。在线路上部建筑方面，运输营业初期干线每公里只需铺设枕木一千六百根，而我们却不管运输量多少，每公里一律铺设了一千八百四十根；石碴厚度只需铺设三十五公分，我们却铺设了四十五公分以上。这些过早的投资不但分散了国家的建设资金，影响经济建设的进度，而且还增加了折旧、大修及经常维修的费用。
    再次是盲目追求形式，增加了很多不必要的工程，造成浪费。沿线房屋建筑原可利用自然地形，不必进行大量的土方工程，而我们的设计人员为了追求美观，硬把它们放在同一水平或一定的设计标高上，多做了很多不必要的土方工程，浪费很大。兰新线百分之九十的车站为了同路基取平，都做了高填土，现在还要等待填土沉落才能盖房，不但浪费土方，而且影响工程进度。盲目追求形式还表现在对很多房屋建筑做了不必要的修饰。绵阳广元段房屋建筑，无论宿舍、学校、甚至机务段都在房檐下镶花边、涂彩色、做云花雀替，连烟筒上也镶花涂色，搞得花花绿绿；兰州设计分局办公大厦，安上大屋顶、琉璃瓦、漆上花纹、屋脊上还有仙人走兽；大厦建筑费的设计预算内还包括钢丝录音机、九灯收音机、电唱机等豪华设备。形式主义还表现在增设了很多完全不必要的工程和设备，如兰新路沿线人口稀少，有些地区百十公里无人烟，我们还在道口上修建了看守房，派上道口看守工。兰州武威间每隔五公里就盖一个巡道工交班房，大部分空着没有人住。很多车站甚至在杳无人烟的地方，都装上几百公尺的油漆栅栏。很多小桥也装上两面铁栏杆，桥的两端都插上了很大的桥号标。兰新线所有桥涵两侧都用混凝土建筑了检查梯。这些都是没有必要的。
    此外由于设计技术上的错误，造成的浪费也是严重的，并且还造成使用中的不合理现象。很多车站的设计缺乏总体考虑，布置很不合理。宝成线上很多车站都是背向居民区，旅客上车必须穿过车站全部股道，先到月台后到候车室，严重影响旅客安全和调车作业。绵阳广元段的安昌江桥，由于设计技术错误，桥位选择不当，三年来的防洪费用已为该桥造价的二倍半，现在还不得不另建新桥。
    在施工方面，很多综合施工的工点由于没有总体施工计划，造成各施工单位间的互相干扰。如略阳车站有机械筑路队和房屋建筑队等施工单位，由于工序没有统一布置，机械筑路队弃土的地方将来房屋建筑队施工时还要挖去。由于对操纵和检修机械力量的配备，各个工序间的衔接，油料的储备等各项条件估计不足，机械使用上的浪费也很严重。如第六工程局一九五四年四月至十一月，机械实际利用率只达百分之八点六。劳动力的浪费也很严重。第一工程局第一季度桥涵工程劳动生产率只达计划的百分之五十，缺勤、请假、调遣等损失达七万工作日，辅助工资超支二十万元。该局目前基本工人二万六千人，而非生产人员却达八千人之多。建厂工程公司平均二点六个生产人员就配上了一个管理人员（临时工除外）。不注意就地取材，舍近取远的现象也很严重。第六工程局很多料石都在山下开采，采后运往山上，而山上开采出来的大批石方，却没有地方弃置，甚至干扰施工。渭河工地不用渭河卵石，而从十多公里以外的清姜河采运。略阳工地在相距一百多公里的嘉陵江下游广元一带开采料石，向上游拖运，而上游荷叶坝的石方却弃置不用。再如石碴每方要十四元，河卵石每方只要三元，因此用卵石铺道床比石碴便宜很多，但我们很少采用；有些地方虽然采用了，但盲目规定将卵石捶碎以后使用，以致每方浪费了三个工，一公里就浪费了五千个工。
    造成以上浪费的主要原因是什么呢？
    首先，是因为铁道部从部直至基层单位的各级领导工作人员对社会主义建设的艰苦性复杂性认识不足，对厉行节约、反对浪费乃是长期的政治任务认识不足，致使许多工程的标准脱离现实条件和实际需要，如线路上部建筑及桥涵等设计标准，有不少是从苏联设计标准上照抄过来的，我们既未很好研究苏联设计标准的发展过程，也没有认真调查分析我国的具体情况和运输需要，就不顾实际地机械搬运，结果，使国家大量资金使用在很多不必要的工程项目中去了！
    其次，对重点建设的方针认识不足，以致在工作中有很多方面违反了重点投资的原则，对生产性建设和非生产性建设不加区别甚至本末倒置，无视运输的需要，把国家的有限资金用到短时期内并不需要的工程上去。这是方针上的错误，铁道部的领导上要负主要责任。例如在即将交付营业的绵阳广元段和兰州武威段上，许多直接同行车有关的设备还不完善，有的车站没有安装照明设备，马角坝以北打柴沟以西都没有信号装置，线路上没有安装防爬器和护轮轨，没有修建给水设备，机车、车辆的检修设备还不完整，像这些该花钱而没有花或者花得不够的地方还很多，但是宿舍、小学校等非生产房屋却已先行盖好。
    再次，是使用投资时没有分清目前需要和将来需要。有些虽然是属于生产性的建设，但在运输营业初期运量不大的情况下，暂时还不需要的，就不应该投资建设。过早建设，必然使国家的一部分资金长期处于呆滞状态。这除了浪费国家资金之外，对于生产是没有任何积极作用的。
    最后，是缺乏经济核算的思想。设计部门和施工部门的工作人员很少注意在工作中加强经济观点，贯彻节约原则；只管工程不惜成本。如有时在勘测资料不全不确的情况下即轻易下了决定，盲目设计，交付施工；有些工程技术人员有严重的形式主义和个人主义的思想，他们在动手设计时，往往不是注意如何贯彻“适用、经济、可能条件下的美观”的原则，而是一味追求形式上的美观，似乎只有这样才足以表现自己的才能。几年来，由于这种错误给国家造成的损失是很大的。
    上述缺点和错误的思想表现是主观主义、形式主义、自由主义和教条主义，它们的共同点都是不从实际出发，不从客观情况出发，按其思想本质来说，都是唯心主义的东西。几年以来，由于铁道部领导水平不高，对这些错误思想的严重性认识不足，未能及时检查揭发这些浪费现象并同它进行严肃的斗争；过去在检查工作中，虽也消除了一些浪费现象，并提出过合理的标准，但也未能坚持贯彻推广，以致这些错误思想依然存在。例如，一九五二年我们曾到西南地区检查铁路工作，发现成都车站站场面积过大，我们当时就决定缩小，由七千多市亩减为四千市亩；成都机车修理工厂原占地达二十五公里，后减为五公里。重庆车站修建两个站台就够了，竟计划修建五个，我们检查时已经修了两个半，当时就制止不准再修。一九五三年我们到西北检查兰新线工程，也曾指出厕所修建过多过好。这样做是符合节约观点的，但未能将这种节约观点坚持下来。一九五二年天津铁路管理局修建的住宅造价每平方公尺单价三十四元六角，基本上适合我国当前的经济情况，因此是比较合理的。但当时并不是所有工作人员都认识到这点，有些人认为过低，我们虽曾同这种错误思想进行过斗争，发了指示要求全国铁路推行，并曾组织各局工务处长到天津现场学习，而且有些管理局如北京、郑州、济南等路局均已推行，但由于我们对这一问题的认识不够深刻，未能以顽强的战斗精神坚持到底，最后还是铺张浪费、盲目提高标准的思想占了上风，合理的标准未能全面贯彻，造成严重浪费。这些必须引为经验教训。
    为了克服浪费、厉行节约、降低工程造价，经铁道部领导机关讨论研究后，定出了六十项措施，这些措施归纳起来，可以分为以下几个部分：
    一、取消不必要的投资。在新线工程中，经检查发现有十种工程必须坚决取消，其中包括：取消桥号标，将桥号写在桥台上；取消桥涵两侧的检查梯，改用土阶并减少其数量；取消巡道工交班房；取消无农田处的铁路界标；取消小桥上的护轮轨；在小站、会让站及中间站上，因旅客不多，可取消站台墙、栅栏及检票亭。此外，规定修建临时房屋不准购地，改为租地；隧道内干燥或排水良好时，即可不铺底。在坚石或黄土地段设计路堑边坡，应取消平台，以节省挖方。
    二、取消过早的投资。过去我们有不少工程做早了，使资金分散使用，特别在新建铁路上，这方面的浪费是严重的。经审查计算在运输营业初期，至少可以减少以下一些投资。如枕木根数原定干线每公里为一千八百四十根，可减为一千六百根，每千公里可节省三百三十六万元；石碴厚度由原定四十五公分减为三十五公分，每千公里可节约五百六十万元；房屋数量太多，正式房屋原定每公里六百平方公尺，减为五百平方公尺，每千公里可节省一千万元。
    运输营业初期应严格按照行车需要设站，小站一般设两股道，根据会车需要，部分可设三股道；一切建设以配合运输需要为主，永久性文化福利建筑物，应分期修建；不需要看守的道口，一律不建道口看守房，尤其西北人烟稀少，即使同公路交叉的道口也可暂时不设。
    根据区别目前需要和将来需要的原则，铁道部曾重新考虑了经济调查资料，局部改善了原有设备，提高了通过能力，因而推迟了沙城至大同复线和石家庄到阳泉复线的修建，节省了投资约一亿元，取消了成渝铁路目前还不需要投资的改线落坡工程五百万元。
    三、改变设计标准。过去我们在线路、桥梁、隧道和房屋等方面盲目提高设计标准，是造成严重浪费的重要原因之一，今后必须适当降低。
    在线路设计上，道床尽可能就地采用卵石，并规定除曲线、道岔和桥梁外，所用卵石一律筛选，不得捶碎，如此每千公里可节省三百二十万元；要求将非干线铁路的路基及一切岔线的宽度，视土质情况减为四点五或五公尺；临时便线、岔线、道口和桥梁的护轮轨等禁止使用新钢轨。
    在桥梁设计上，要求小桥不设栏杆，仅允许在较大桥梁上设置木质单侧栏杆，每千公里可节省九万元；不冻结和不受冲刷的桥墩基础，可采用较低级的一一○号混凝土，并可掺片石。
    在隧道设计上，边墙衬砌用的料石，应以片石来代替；凡石质坚硬的隧道，可以不加衬砌。
    在房屋设计上，应注意就地取材。临时房屋要尽量少建，其建筑费每平方公尺单价不得超过十元。如按原规定每平方公尺四十元，每公里五百平方公尺计算，每千公里可节省投资一千五百万元。正式房屋标准也应降低，每平方公尺单价，一律不准超过中央规定。
    四、调整设计预算。以往我们缺乏精打细算精神，设计预算作得过高、过大，造成很大浪费。如我们在设计预算内，列有大量隧道支撑，并列有占耗损量二点五倍的支撑备用量，今后只列耗损量，不应列备用量。我们在设计预算内所规定的明挖松石的劳动生产定额比开隧道的定额还低，致使土石方工人的工资超过隧道工人的工资，这是不合理的，应该加以调整。
    我们在作设计预算时，很少考虑利用自然地形和就地取材，增加了运费支出和许多不必要的工程，因此必须重新审查设计规程及设计图表，审查线路及房屋建筑对地形的利用程度，做好施工组织调查，充分利用当地材料，尽量避免从山下向山上运，下水向上水运。
    为了减少非生产费用，将正式房屋内家俱费由原占房屋造价百分之七减为百分之三点五；医药卫生费及监理费等也应减少。
    五、提高设计技术。设计技术错误也是造成浪费的主要原因之一。因此，必须重新审定车站避难线的位置和机车交路的分布情况。在可能条件下，应尽量将避难线设于车站尽头，这样可以使避难线的长度大为缩减；机车交路应使其达到标准长度。这些都可减少投资增加运输营业的便利。
    为了避免修建临时给水及正式给水的双重费用，应加强正式水源的勘测设计及施工工作，使临时给水成为正式给水的组成部分。
    此外，桥梁镶面和隧道洞门镶面石料的加工，基本办法应采用只凿边缘的粗凿石，不应凿成六面光或五面光；在石质较好的地方，隧道衬砌厚度亦可减薄，甚至可不衬砌。
    六、改善施工组织。施工组织混乱，各有关部门之间的配合不够及机械、材料的管理和使用不好，也是造成工程造价高、浪费大的主要原因之一。今后必须克服这些缺点，加强基建、设计、施工三部门之间的配合协作，做好施工安排，每一工点必须有统一的施工组织设计和统一的施工领导；使用汽车运料方面应充分利用汽车的能力，重车可增加拖斗，同地方采取紧密联系，利用回空装载地方物资，或采取空车连挂（一辆拉一辆）以节省油料；尽量满载，减少空率并提高周转率，以节省运费。要积极推行先进工作方法，如大爆破、水风钻、小型机械化等，并推行计件工资，加强劳动组织，以节省工费，提高劳动生产率；加强机械及材料管理，认真做好材料试验工作，增加支撑木、模型板、脚手架等使用次数，以节省机械使用费及材料费。
    此外，必须精简机构，紧缩编制，大量减少非生产人员，以节省开支。要求划清各单位的职责范围及工作关系，采取先定机构后定人员的办法，坚决裁并一切可有可无及重复的机构。各单位特别是领导工作人员应当养成艰苦朴素的作风，不但要从大的方面，而且要从细小的方面去厉行节约，如办公用具及水、电等都应注意节省；开会除用开水外，一律不准招待香烟、水果、点心，或举办招待晚会等；除招待外宾外，一律不准宴会和聚餐。
    为了贯彻以上措施，铁道部已着手进行修正设计规程，修改各种定型设计并组织力量修改若干目前已经开工工程的设计文件，这个工作是艰巨的，但必须坚决完成。
    认真执行了以上措施，必然会大大降低工程造价。根据上面指出的六十项措施中有十五项可以估计出节约数字的措施，每千公里即可减少投资六千三百八十余万元。相当于一千公里投资总额的百分之十以上，其中三项非生产性建设，如减少房屋建筑数量及降低其造价，即可节省五千万元，几达十五项节约总数的百分之八十。由此可见，我们的节约重点是结合我国目前经济情况，大量减少非生产性建设的支出，此外，对生产性建设还应根据节约的原则在保证质量的条件下，尽量降低造价，并根据国家运输需要采用分期投资的办法，削减其中过早的投资。
    根据以上的措施，将一九五五年至一九五七年铁路基本建设工作量加以计算，三年平均较原计划投资总额（扣除钢铁构架）降低百分之二六点九，仅一九五五年即可为国家节约一亿七千三百九十九万元，用这笔款子可以新建三百四十公里新铁路。
    动员群众认真学习苏联先进经验，开展厉行节约、反对浪费的斗争是完成降低造价降低运输及工业成本的重要手段，因此，必须从各方面实行极端严格的节约制度，广泛动员群众揭露各种浪费现象，为消灭各种浪费而斗争。
    在完成今年降低造价的任务中，必须注意安全生产，并应有长期打算，坚决反对只顾眼前不顾将来的思想和作风，要求设计工作既要结合目前情况，还要考虑将来发展，整体设计，分期施工。同时，严格的节约制度，必须建立在保证质量的基础上。工程质量必须在任何时候、任何标准下都要符合设计要求，都要保证良好。
    在完成国家建设任务中，还必须经常提高全体员工的政治思想水平，加强保卫工作，不断提高员工的阶级觉悟。必须把暗藏在我们队伍中的一切反革命分子清除出去，我们才能安心地从事建设。
    总之，进行基本建设工作，必须要有经济观点，同时也必须保证质量，保证安全，抓紧进度，才能全面完成国家任务。
    除了降低工程造价以外，一九五五年铁路运输成本，根据节约的原则，要较原计划再降低百分之一点零五，大修工程费要降低百分之四，附业成本再降低百分之二等，也是一九五五年全国铁路职工的奋斗目标，应力争超额完成。
    一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划建设的第三年，完成今年的任务，对完成国家第一个五年计划是具有决定意义的。全国铁路职工必须在党的领导下，努力学习苏联经验，戒骄戒躁，艰苦奋斗，克服一切非工人阶级思想，反对浪费，厉行节约，为质量良好地完成今年的基本建设计划、降低造价、降低运输及工业成本，为国家节省建设资金，加速社会主义建设而努力。
