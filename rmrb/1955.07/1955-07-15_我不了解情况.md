    "I don't understand the situation..."
    Yijin
    In February, while most farmers on the vast plains south of the Yellow River were busy耕地 (plowing the fields) and delivering manure, the fields of Huangdian Village in Dingtao County, Shandong, were deserted. This village is where the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Dingtao County and the Fifth District Office of Dingtao County were located. I walked into the courtyard of a blue-tiled house in this village, and in the spacious office, I saw a man of about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old, lazily sitting there. I handed him the letter of introduction written by the Dingtao County Committee, and without even raising his eyelids, he grunted "Oh," and then said, "If you want to get materials on mutual aid and cooperation, you can go to Yanlou Township. Yanlou is our base, has more cadres, and the work is better."
    "The comrades of the County Committee told me to go to Huangdian Village to understand the situation."
    This comrade saw that I had not followed his advice and immediately said unhappily, "I don't understand the situation in this township!"
    I knew in Dingtao County that the Secretary of the Fifth District Committee and the District Chief were both at a meeting in the county, and only Deputy District Chief Ning Wuchen was in charge of the work in the district. So I asked, "Are you Deputy District Chief Ning Wuchen?"
    "Yes! If you want to understand the agricultural producers' cooperative in this village, just look at that table."
    "The Minister of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Department of the County Committee said that you were in Huangdian when the cooperative was being established and that you are responsible for the mutual aid and cooperation work in the whole district, and told me to look for you."
    "Then let's chat about it tonight! Anyway, I don't understand the situation very well," he said with a very unhappy look.
    The next day, I attended a forum of the heads of the eleven agricultural producers' cooperatives in Huangdian Village in the folk school in Huangdian West Street. For some reason, the room was also crowded with people outside.
    "You have to be fair! You only give me so few work points for a day's work..." A shrill voice of a middle-aged woman burst out from outside the room.
    I asked the street leader Huang Rubai why it was so noisy outside, and Huang Rubai said, "These are all members of the agricultural producers' cooperatives. There are many problems in the cooperatives; they heard that you are from above and want to solve their problems."
    "The District Committee and the District Office are in this village, don't they care?"
    "Last year's wheat hasn't been divided clearly yet, and many cooperatives can't figure out their accounts, how can they not quarrel!" Huang Rubai paused, and said with a dissatisfied tone, "Take my younger brother Ruwan as an example: he is the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Township Branch, and he joined the cooperative led by Huang Rumao last year; others divide the profits half by land and half by labor, but he gets eight parts for land and two parts for labor. The members don't say it to his face, but behind his back they have a lot of opinions!"
    "Is there no one in the district who cares?"
    "Don't mention that no one asks about these things, last autumn Huang Rumao's wife argued with a member about profit sharing and jumped into a pit to seek death, we reported it to the assistant Wang Lingyun who was in charge of this village, but he said 'I don't have time,' shook his head, waved his hand, and went to listen to the opera with the township cadres."
    As soon as Wang Lingyun was mentioned, the whole room burst into laughter. One of the cooperative heads interjected, "Wang Erkenchi [Wang the Easy Eater] is really like a deaf man's ear, it's all the same whether he's there or not." This Wang Lingyun was originally a staff member who liked to eat and drink but didn't do any work. Therefore, the masses of this village gave him the nickname "Wang Erkenchi."
    Everyone talked about the current spring plowing situation. The eleven "cooperatives" in Huangdian West Street have greatly reduced fertilization this spring compared to the past; no production plans have been made. Huang Ruhe said: "When we worked individually, we used to apply two or three carts of manure per mu of spring land, but our cooperative of thirty mu of spring land has only applied more than twenty carts of manure this year... Cattle have also died. The eleven cooperatives in West Street had forty-four head of cattle, and eleven died last winter. Some cattle pens haven't been padded with soil all winter, and the manure and urine have frozen into ice, so the cattle can only stand and can't lie down."
    "How can livestock not die like this!" Cooperative head Huang Rusui said.
    After the meeting, Xiong Jucan, the staff member in charge of eliminating illiteracy here, told me: In March last year, when the unified grain purchase work was about to end, the District Committee decided to establish cooperatives in Huangdian Village. Guo Qingfa and Wang Lingyun, staff members of the district, said at a mass meeting: "Selling surplus grain and joining mutual aid and cooperation means that you have no capitalist thoughts and are truly taking the socialist road." No further explanation was given. Subsequently, staff members of the Township People's Government shouted through the loudspeaker: "Joining the cooperative means you can buy soybean cakes first." As a result, brothers found brothers, uncles found nephews, and they put livestock in the same trough, and that was considered a "cooperative." The District Committee only investigated clearly two months later, and found that Huangdian, with two hundred and sixty-four households, had established thirty-three "cooperatives." Last autumn, people quarreled every day over work points, and some even had their heads broken.
    And it wasn't just that. Half of the "cooperatives" in this village had no poor peasants, twenty-five "cooperatives" had not a single Communist Party member, and all twenty-three landlords and rich peasants in the village had mixed into the "cooperatives." The District Committee still does not understand this situation.
    I stayed in Huangdian Village for three days. Day and night, the sounds of吵吵嚷嚷 (arguing and yelling) and fighting were endless. Liu Yonghe, the secretary of the township government, told me: There are five or six quarrels every day in Huangdian. The staff members of the district always used words like "can't control," "too backward," and "let's investigate and talk about it later" to push things away and ignore them. Several cooperative members said to me: I heard that the cooperatives in other places are doing very well and have achieved high yields; our place has been ruined by those comrades in the district.
    I found Comrade He Jiumin, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, and wanted to know more about the situation from him. But he also said: "I don't understand much."
    I told him some of the things I knew, and he just nodded and said "Yes," and said "It's a great help to us..."
    In March, people were even busier in the fields. I came to Huangdian Village to visit again. I met the street leader Huang Rubai on the street, and I asked him: "Has your street's cooperative been rectified?" He said, "The comrades in the district only told us to merge the cooperatives, but they didn't lead us. After the merger, the livestock fodder can't be solved, let alone the spring plowing."
    I also met the township secretary Liu Yonghe. When I asked about the situation of the agricultural producers' cooperative in Huangdian Village, he said: "The work of merging cooperatives has begun, and West Street, East Street, and North Street have been merged into five or six large cooperatives. How they were merged, the situation is still not clear."
    I went to the District Office and saw Deputy District Chief Ning Wuchen again. When I asked him about the problem of rectifying the agricultural producers' cooperative, he said: "The situation of the cooperative merger is still not known."
    I requested to see Comrade Zhao Rucai, Secretary of the District Committee, three times to understand the situation of the cooperative rectification in Huangdian Village. Finally, he saw me and also said: "I don't know about the agricultural cooperative in Huangdian!"
    "How is the spring plowing production?"
    "Spring plowing production has already started..."
    However, according to my understanding, what was "started" in Huangdian Village at that time was not spring plowing production, but still天天动嘴动气 (daily arguing and getting angry) because the problem of mutual aid and cooperation had not been resolved.
    Comrades who are always saying "I don't understand the situation," go to the masses to understand the situation quickly!

### “我不了解情况……”

    “我不了解情况……”
    义进
    二月间，黄河南岸大平原上的大部分农民正在忙着耕地、送粪的时候，山东定陶县黄店村的地里却是冷清清的。这个村子是中共定陶县第五区委员会和定陶县第五区公所所在的地方。我走进了这个村子里的一个青色瓦房的院落，在宽敞的办公室里，看到一个二十八九岁的人，懒洋洋地坐在那里。我把定陶县委写的介绍信递给他，他连眼皮也没翻，“哦”了一声，接着说：“你要搞互助合作的材料，可以上阎楼乡。阎楼是我们的基点，干部也多，工作也好。”
    “县委的同志们叫我到黄店村了解了解。”
    这位同志看我没听从他的意见，马上不高兴地说：“这个乡，我不了解情况！”
    我在定陶县知道第五区的区委书记和区长都在县里开会，只有宁武臣副区长在区里掌握工作。我就问：“你是不是宁武臣副区长？”
    “是呀！你要了解这个村的农业生产合作社，看看那个表就行了。”
    “县委互助合作部部长说你在建社时就在黄店，又负责全区的互助合作工作，要我找你。”
    “那就晚上扯扯吧！反正我不大了解情况。”他带着很不高兴的样子说。
    第二天，我在黄店西街的民校里参加了黄店村的十一个农业生产合作社社长的座谈会。不知为什么，屋子外也挤满了人。
    “你说话要公正些！俺干一天只给俺记那一点分……”屋子外面爆发出一个中年妇女的尖利的声音。
    我问街长黄汝柏，为什么屋外也乱嚷嚷的，黄汝柏说：“这些都是农业生产合作社的社员。社里有很多问题；听说你是上边来的，都想来解决解决自己的问题。”
    “区委和区公所都在这村里，他们不管吗？”
    “去年的麦子到现在还没分清，很多社算不清账，他们怎么能不吵架呢！”黄汝柏停了停，带着不满意的口气说：“拿我弟弟汝万说吧：他是青年团乡支部书记，去年入了黄汝茂领导的那个社；别人分红是地劳各半，他却是地八劳二。社员们当面不说，背地里意见可大啦！”
    “区里没一个人管吗？”
    “别说这些事情没人问，去年秋天黄汝茂的老婆和社员争分吵架，跳坑寻死，我们报告负责领导这个村的助理员王凌云，他却说‘没有空’，头一摇，手一摆，便同乡干部听戏去了。”
    一提到王凌云，全场轰然大笑。一个社长插进来说：“王二肯吃，真是聋子耳朵，这村上的工作有他没他都一样。”这王凌云，原来是个好吃好喝不做工作的工作人员。因此，这村的群众给他起了个外号叫“王二肯吃”。
    大家谈了当前的春耕情况。黄店西街十一个“社”，今春施肥比过去大大减少了；生产计划都没订。黄汝合说：“我们单干的时候，春地平均每亩还上两三车粪，俺社三十亩春地，今年才上了二十多车粪。……牛也死了，西街十一个社有四十四头牛，去冬就死了十一头。有的牛栏一冬天没有垫过土，粪尿结成冰，牛只能站，不能卧。”
    “这怎能不死牲口呢！”社长黄汝随说。
    散会后，在这里负责扫除文盲的工作人员熊聚灿对我说：去年三月间，粮食统购工作快要结束的时候，区委决定在黄店村建社。区里的工作人员郭庆法和王凌云在群众大会上说：“卖了余粮就参加互助合作，就算没有资本主义思想，真正走社会主义的道路。”此外什么解释都没有了。随后，乡人民政府的工作人员又拿着广播筒喊道：“入了社可以先买豆饼。”这样一来，兄找弟，叔找侄，把牲口一合槽，就算成了“社”。区委在两个月以后才调查清，黄店二百六十四户，成立了三十三个“社”。去年秋天，为干活争分，每天都有吵架的，有的打破了头。
    还不仅这样。这村半数“社”没有贫农，二十五个“社”没有一个共产党员，全村二十三户地主富农却都混进了“社”。区委对这情况至今还不了解。
    我在黄店村住了三天。白天，夜里，吵吵嚷嚷，打架骂架的声音不绝于耳。乡政府秘书刘永和对我说：黄店哪天也有五六起吵架的。区里的工作人员总是用“管不了”、“太落后”、“调查调查再说吧”这些话推开不管。好几个社员对我说：听说别的地方的社办得挺好，丰产了；俺这里就是叫区里那些同志给领导坏了。
    我找到区委副书记何纠民同志，想从他那里知道更多的情况。那知，他也说：“我不大了解。”
    我把自己知道的一些情况告诉了他，他只是点头称“是”，说“对我们帮助很大……”
    三月，在田野间，人们更忙了。我又来黄店村访问。在街上碰到了街长黄汝柏，我问他：“你们街上的社整顿了没有？”他说：“区里的同志光叫我们合并社，也不去领导。合并以后，牲口草料就没法解决，更不用说春耕了。”
    我又见到了乡秘书刘永和。我问黄店村农业生产合作社的情况的时候，他说：“并社工作开始了，西街、东街、北街已经合并成了五六个大社。怎样合并的，情况还闹不清。”
    我走到区公所，又见到了宁武臣副区长。问他整顿农业生产合作社的问题，他说：“并社的情况还不知道。”
    我三次请求见见区委书记赵如才同志，向他了解了解黄店村整顿社的情况。最后，他见了我，也说：“黄店农业合作社的事，我还不知道呢！”
    “春耕生产的情况怎样？”
    “春耕生产已经动起来了……”
    但是，据我了解，那时黄店村“动起来”的不是春耕生产，仍然是由于互助合作的问题没有解决而天天动嘴动气。
    老是“不了解情况”的同志们，快些到群众中去了解了解情况吧！
