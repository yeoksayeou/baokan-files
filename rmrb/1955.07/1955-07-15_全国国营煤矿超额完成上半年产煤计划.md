Xinhua News Agency, July 14th. National state-owned coal mines have exceeded their coal production plan for the first half of this year. Coal production increased by 11.6 percent compared to the first half of last year.

The cost of state-owned coal mines in the first half of this year was also lower than in the past. From January to May alone, it was 2.72 million yuan lower than the planned cost. Fuxin Mining Bureau, while ensuring safety, used a large amount of cheap wood as material for wooden plank false roofs and supports, which not only reduced coal mining costs but also saved a lot of good timber. In the first quarter of this year, Jixi Mining Bureau consumed 2.1 cubic meters less pit wood per 1,000 tons of coal produced than planned.

    全国国营煤矿超额完成上半年产煤计划
    新华社十四日讯全国国营煤矿超额完成了今年上半年的产煤计划。生产的煤炭，比去年上半年增加了百分之十一点六。
    国营煤矿今年上半年的成本也比过去降低。仅一月到五月就比计划成本降低了二百七十二万元。阜新矿务局在保证安全的情况下，利用大量廉价的木材作木板假顶的材料和支柱，不但降低了采煤成本，还节省了很多好木材。鸡西矿务局今年第一季度中每生产一千吨煤，就比计划少消耗二点一立方公尺的坑木。
