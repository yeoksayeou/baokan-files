    Strive to Fulfill the First Five-Year Plan
    Most Equipment in the Auxiliary Workshops of the First Automobile Factory Put into Trial Production
    Most of the equipment in the eight workshops of the auxiliary workshops of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been put into trial production.
    Since the three tool workshops of the auxiliary workshops were put into trial production in February this year, they have been undertaking the production task of manufacturing the first batch of tools needed for automobile manufacturing. With the gradual improvement of the technical level of the workers, the output of various complex and precise gauges, stamping dies, forging dies, clamps, attachments, and other tools has been increasing month by month. Recently, the tool library has been filled with special tools for automobile manufacturing. A batch of more than 1,000 kinds of tools, currently being produced as an urgent task, will be completed in August for use in the workshops that are about to begin adjusting production.
    The machine repair workshop of the auxiliary workshops has produced more than 60 non-standard equipment and more than 200 sets of equipment spare parts for more than ten workshops to meet the current needs of equipment installation. In addition, the installation, electrical repair, furnace construction, and thermal power workshops have also manufactured and repaired a large number of work station appliances, motors, and instruments.
    The most precise and complex tools and large stamping dies and forging dies needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in the early stage of construction were supplied by the Soviet Union. In the future, tens of thousands of non-standard tools and stamping dies used in the production of the entire plant will be manufactured by the tool workshops of the auxiliary workshops. The machine repair workshop, equipped with various types of machine tools, has the ability to manufacture various special equipment and accessories. Other workshops will also be responsible for managing and repairing the electrical equipment, instruments, various furnaces, and pipelines of the entire plant.

    Anshan Iron and Steel's Fourth Automated Blast Furnace Taps Iron
    At 6:40 PM on the 17th, the ironmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company opened the taphole of the rebuilt fourth automated blast furnace, and the first furnace of boiling molten iron flowed out. So far, four of the six automated blast furnaces planned to be built in Anshan during China's first five-year plan have been completed.
    The rebuilt automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was put into operation 15 days ahead of the national plan.
    The construction technology of the workers who built this blast furnace has greatly improved compared with the construction of the third blast furnace. The labor used to build this blast furnace was reduced by one-third compared with the construction of the third blast furnace, and the construction period was also shortened by several days. During construction, the installation of complex winches and electrical equipment was carried out relatively smoothly; the labor productivity of the furnace building workers also increased by 50% compared with the construction of the third blast furnace.
    The engineering quality of the fourth automated blast furnace has also been significantly improved. The trial operation of all equipment was successfully completed at one time; the hot blast stove had to be pressure tested seven or eight times in previous years, but this year the first pressure test exceeded the national quality standards.

    Reconstruction of Baoji-Tianshui Section of Longhai Railway Begins
    The first phase of the reconstruction project of the Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway has begun in full swing. Now, along the Weihe River valley, more than 6,000 road construction workers are stepping up the construction of bridges, tunnel adits, retaining walls, drainage ditches and other projects in the mountains for more than 100 kilometers. Temporary flood control projects such as water diversion dams and stone cage revetments are also being built along the Weihe River. The timely completion of these projects before the rainy season will ensure the safe passage of this section of the railway during the rainy season.
    The Baoji-Tianshui section of the railway was built during the Kuomintang rule and the engineering quality was very poor, and it was called the "blind intestine" of the railway. In order to rebuild this section of the railway into a line that meets the standards of the railway trunk line, the state requires that the reconstruction work of this section of the railway be carried out in stages during the first five-year plan period while maintaining traffic. Many of the projects currently under construction are the first step in the entire reconstruction project.

    China's First Inclined Oil Well Starts Drilling
    China's first inclined oil well started drilling on July 16 at the Laojunmiao Oilfield in Yumen Oil Mine. Not long ago, a new oil layer was discovered in the Laojunmiao Oilfield in Yumen Oil Mine. Due to fault relations, this new oil layer is almost perpendicular to the ground plane. Therefore, in order to explore the oil reserves of this new oil layer, it is not possible to use the ordinary method of drilling vertical wells, but inclined wells must be drilled.
    The technology of drilling inclined wells is more complicated than drilling vertical wells, and it is the first time that this method has been used in China's oil drilling. Yumen Oil Mine had made full preparations in advance. In addition to inviting Soviet experts for specific guidance and equipping them with the latest Soviet drilling rigs, it also transferred a group of experienced old drilling workers with experience in drilling vertical wells of more than 2,000 meters to participate in the work.

    Nihewa Flood Storage Project Completed
    The Nihewa Flood Storage Project in the upper reaches of the Huai River was completed on July 15. During the construction period, a giant water inlet gate with twelve holes, 11 meters high and more than 140 meters long, a three-hole water outlet gate, and a 17-kilometer-long and 69-meter-high dam surrounding the triangular area between the Sha and Feng Rivers were built. At the same time, the levees of 17 villages and 22 large and small culverts were repaired, and the Xiaoni River was dredged. The dikes of the Sha and Feng Rivers near the flood storage area were also reinforced.
    The Nihewa Flood Storage Project is a major project for the treatment of the Sha River, and it is also the twelfth medium-sized or larger depression flood storage project built in the Huai River management project. This project is built near Luohe City, Henan Province. This project can store more than 236 million cubic meters of floodwater. In the years of heavy floods, this project can reduce the flood peak of the Sha River below Luohe City, relieve the threat of floods to the Jinghan Railway and Luohe City, and protect more than one million mu of farmland on both sides of the lower reaches of the Sha River from flood disasters.

    陇海铁路宝天段动工改建
    改造陇海铁路宝（鸡）天（水）段的第一期工程已经全面动工。现在，沿着渭河河谷一百多公里的丛山中，六千多个筑路工人正在加紧修筑桥梁、隧道明峒、御土墙、排水沟等工程，渭河边上也在修筑挑水坝、石笼护岸等临时性防洪工程。这些工程在雨季前按期完成后，就可保证这段铁路雨季安全通车。
    宝鸡天水段铁路是国民党统治时期修筑的，工程质量很坏，被称为铁路的“盲肠”。为了把这段铁路改建成为合乎铁路干线标准的线路，国家要求在第一个五年计划时期内，在保持通车的情况下，分期进行这段铁路的改造工作。现在正在施工的许多工程是整个改建工程的第一步措施。　（新华社）
    我国第一口石油斜井开钻
    我国第一口石油斜井七月十六日在玉门油矿老君庙油田上开钻。不久以前，在玉门油矿老君庙油田上发现一个新油层，这个新油层由于断层关系，几乎和地平面成垂直形。因此，要探明这一个新油层的储油量，就不能用普通打直井的方法，而必须钻凿斜井。
    钻凿斜井技术比钻凿直井复杂，在我国石油钻井中又是第一次使用这种方法。玉门油矿事先曾进行了充分的准备，除请苏联专家具体指导，配备苏联最新式钻机外，还调出一批具有打两千公尺以上直井经验的老钻井工人参加工作。　（新华社）
