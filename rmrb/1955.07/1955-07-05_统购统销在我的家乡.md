    Unified Purchase and Marketing in My Hometown
　　National People's Congress Representative Aiwu

    During my recent inspection in Xinfan County, Sichuan, I was truly delighted to see the rapid progress in my hometown, which I hadn't visited in thirty years. After the unified purchase and marketing of 1953, the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer in the countryside was thoroughly stopped. Subsequently, large numbers of farmers embarked on the path of collectivization. Many poor farmers who originally lacked cattle, farm tools, and fertilizer, and who were short of food for several months each year, became surplus grain households because their land was invested in cooperatives and production improved. Unified purchase and marketing in my hometown, Xinfan, Sichuan, can be said to have won a great victory.

    Before the unified purchase and marketing in 1953, the power of the rich peasants had reached a truly frightening level. They engaged in large-scale grain speculation, buying low and selling high. Sometimes they even intercepted and bought grain at high prices, transporting it to distant counties to sell at even higher prices. For example, Su Jiyun, a rich peasant from the Third Village of Qingbai Township, organized more than eighty handcarts to transport and sell grain, also offering transport services to others. The cart-pushers were mostly poor peasants, who could earn more than one yuan a day. A prevailing idea was that farming was not worthwhile, earning only a few cents a day, which was not as profitable as pushing a cart. As a result, many poor peasants went to push carts, delaying production and greatly reducing harvests. Su Jiyun, who organized the cart transport, received a tribute of two cents a day from each cart-pusher. He also calculated transport fees for each person, rounding up every eight cents to ten, meaning that any remainder of eight cents or more was not paid, all falling into his hands. In the evenings, he hosted gambling at his home, inviting the cart-pushers to play cards, dice, poker, and mahjong. He could extract a commission of ten to twenty yuan a night. Su Jiyun encouraged village cadres from middle-peasant backgrounds to engage in business and village cadres from poor-peasant backgrounds to push carts. One day, a township people's representative casually said, "In a couple of days, I'm going to push a cart too." Su Jiyun quickly sent a cart and grain sacks to him personally. On the other hand, he treated non-cadre poor peasants with arrogance and coercion, often threatening to stop them from pushing carts and scolding them at will. Village meetings were often difficult to convene because many people had gone to push carts and do business. Sometimes, even when people were gathered, those attending would urge for a quick end, saying they needed to go to Su Jiyun's place to discuss pushing carts and doing business. Some rich peasants not only did business themselves but also lent money to poor peasants to speculate in grain. The work teams sent by the county were unable to carry out their work, and it was not easy to convene meetings of party members, cadres, etc., because they had all gone to push carts and do business. Moreover, the comrades in the work team could not find food to eat in the village and had no way to settle down. Similar situations were common in other villages. This was the strange phenomenon that inevitably arose when peasants followed the rich peasants onto the capitalist road.

    In addition, rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants also used large quantities of white rice to feed pigs to earn even more money. Because one catty of white rice fed to pigs could produce one catty of pork, one catty of white rice could only be sold for seven or eight cents, while one catty of pork could be sold for more than thirty cents. Rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants raised pigs on a large scale, feeding an average of two catties of white rice to each pig per day. Some well-to-do middle peasants, who were originally surplus grain households and should have had rice to sell, turned into grain-deficient households because they used large quantities of rice to feed pigs, forcing them to buy rice from the market. This was bound to create a grain shortage.

    I deeply feel that without the policy of unified purchase and marketing, the capitalist forces in the countryside would have truly flooded like a torrent, submerging many peasants and causing them great suffering. Today, many peasants, recalling the situation before unified purchase and marketing, sigh and say, "If there hadn't been unified purchase and marketing, I would have even sold my land."

    However, the rich peasants, having their path to wealth blocked, were unwilling to give up and tried to resist during the unified purchase and to find opportunities to counterattack after the unified purchase, to restore their free trade. At the same time, landlords and a group of controlled elements also took the opportunity to make trouble, deliberately creating grain shortages to make the peasants dissatisfied with the People's Government. Some well-to-do middle peasants, who had originally been doing business with the rich peasants, also wanted to do business again, joining in the clamor about grain shortages.

    The most vicious method of the rich peasants was to instigate village cadres to oppose the government's policies. For example, Wu Zengshu, a well-to-do middle peasant and a member of the support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers committee in the Eighth Group of the Ninth Village of Qingliu Township, led many women to the village office during the unified purchase, wailing that they could not sell more grain, or they would starve to death, causing other women to cry as well. It was estimated that his yield could sell 1,200 catties, but he only sold 900 catties. If you deduct the 700 catties of rice he had already bought and hoarded from the grain market, he only sold 200 catties of rice in reality. His crying was completely feigned. Later, during the rectification of the unified marketing work and the clarification of the line between the enemy and ourselves, he voluntarily confessed that he had been instigated by the rich peasant Ning Jiaodong because he and Ning Jiaodong had always been doing rice hoarding business together. In the second unified purchase in 1954, he sold 1,200 catties of rice according to his yield. This crying incident clearly demonstrates the insidiousness of the rich peasants. Among the eighteen households who cried along with Wu Zengshu, four were rich peasants.

    In the spring and summer of 1954, rich peasants instigated cadres to create a shortage of grain. For example, Qiu Yunxing, a party member in the Fourteenth Village of Qingliu Township, said at a mass meeting that he had enough grain and guaranteed that he would not cause a grain shortage or buy rice. Liu Taigui, a member of the Communist Youth League, together with five or six others, went to Qiu Yunxing's home, sat on the stove, and demanded that Qiu Yunxing provide food, causing Qiu's family members to be afraid to light the fire and cook. Other farmers with grain became afraid and, even though they had grain, had to say that they were short of grain. Later, Liu Taigui confessed at a League meeting that he had been instigated by the rich peasant because he was in love with the rich peasant's daughter, hence the chaos. In reality, he had rice himself and was not short of grain.

    Landlords and rich peasants also directly shouted about grain shortages. Chen Hongqing, a rich peasant in the Fourteenth Village of Qingliu Township, shouted that he had no rice to eat, scolded the village cadres, and said to them, "If you find any rice, you can cut off my head." He also incited the peasants, saying, "It's no good that the Communist Party has come; there's no rice to eat, so what's the point of working." Later, when inspecting his home for hygiene, rice was found hidden inside his pillow and under the mat on his bed. Tu Chengyuan and Tu Guanshou, the landlords in the Twelfth Village of Qingliu Township who first stirred up the grain shortage, also hid rice everywhere, which was all discovered by the peasants inspecting for hygiene.

    Rich peasants, landlords, and a group of controlled elements also rushed to buy noodles and "guokui" (a type of baked flatbread) on the streets; they even intercepted and bought vegetables that the peasants were carrying to the streets to sell, deliberately creating an atmosphere of grain shortage, making many middle and poor peasants uneasy, fearing that they would not be able to buy rice in the future, so they thought it best to buy some now, and therefore also said that grain was in short supply.

    During this period of grain shortage, rich peasants, landlords, and reactionary secret society members took the opportunity to spread rumors. The Yiguan Dao (a religious sect) even printed leaflets to incite the peasants. The leaflets said: "Empty, empty, empty, white rice must be concentrated, starving the poor, infuriating the rich." Rich peasants quietly read such leaflets to the peasants, also saying: Look, isn't it being realized now? I think that unified purchase and marketing has indeed infuriated the rich, but not a single poor person has starved to death. After the poor peasants rectified the unified marketing, they clearly distinguished the line between the enemy and ourselves, realizing that the grain shortage was mainly caused by landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements. The elderly peasants also said: "This way we will no longer suffer losses from the landlords and rich peasants. Before liberation, they speculated in grain and made you miserable. When the rice was harvested, the price of rice and grain was extremely cheap, and they bought it up. When the rice seedlings were planted, the price of rice and grain was frighteningly expensive, and they sold it. Now that the grain is in the hands of the state, the price of rice and grain is the same throughout the year, which is excellent."

    Many poor and middle peasants firmly supported the policies of the People's Government during the unified purchase and marketing, which was very touching. During the unified purchase, they not only honestly sold their surplus grain to the state but also tried to sell more, wholeheartedly wanting to support the country's industrial construction. Li Jiming and Yuan Xiaozhen, people's representatives of the Fifth Village of Qingbai Township, took the lead in economizing and trying to eat more coarse grains, so that even if some members of the joint group they led were genuinely short of grain, they did not buy half a catty of rice, only obtaining some coarse grains to eat. During the grain shortage, not a single person followed others to cause trouble.

    Before the unified purchase and marketing in 1953, many mutual aid teams in Qingbai Township and Qingliu Township collapsed. After the rectification of the unified marketing work in 1954, the peasants recognized the essence of the grain shortage, distinguished the line between the enemy and ourselves, settled down to production, reorganized, and joined cooperatives one after another. Those activists who firmly supported the policies of the People's Government during the unified purchase and marketing and played a leading role among the masses have mostly become leaders and backbones of the cooperatives. The cooperatives are steadily advancing, and the yields of wheat and barley have increased. Many farmers are asking to join the cooperatives. Some elderly farmers, who were opposed to the cooperatives in the past, are also applying to join. They have never had a seal engraved in their lives. Hearing that they need to affix a seal to the application, they specially asked someone to engrave one in the city, which shows their enthusiasm for supporting the cooperatives.

    My hometown, like the vast countryside of the motherland, is leaping forward to a socialist society on the road of cooperatives, but the rich peasants and counter-revolutionary elements have changed their methods and are directly engaging in conspiratorial sabotage against the cooperatives. We must raise our vigilance in the joy of victory.

    统购统销在我的家乡
　　全国人民代表大会代表　艾芜
    我这次到四川新繁县视察，看见三十年没有回过的家乡进步的那样迅速，真使我有说不出的高兴。农村经过一九五三年的统购统销，把富农愈富、贫农愈贫的现象，彻底阻止住了。以后，农民大批地走上合作化道路，好多原是缺乏耕牛农具以及肥料的贫农，每年缺几个月的口粮，都因土地投入合作社，生产情况好转，一跃而成为余粮户了。统购统销，在我的家乡——四川新繁简直可以说，业已大大打了一个胜仗。
    在一九五三年统购统销以前，富农的势力，真是到了可怕的地步。他们大做粮食翻腾生意，低价收买，等到涨价，始行卖出。有时又拦路抢购，不惜高价收买，再运到远的县份，去卖更高的价钱。像清白乡三村富农苏继云组织八十多个手推车子，运卖粮食，并代别人包运。而去推车的，大都是贫农，因一天推车所得，可有一元多。而且还流行一种思想，认为种田种地不值钱，一天只投几分钱，不及推车卖力好。结果好多贫农去推车，耽误了生产，使收成大为减少。富农苏继云组织车子包运，每个推车的每天得孝敬他二分钱。又给每人算车费，用八舍十入的方法，即是尾数如尚有八分钱，便不给了，这又全落入他的手里。晚上他的家里开赌，要推车的人打牌掷骰子，玩扑克麻将。一天晚上他能抽头钱一二十元。苏继云怂恿中农成份的村干部去做生意，贫农出身的村干部去推车子。村里有一个乡人民代表偶然随便说一句：“等二天，我也要去推车子。”苏继云就赶快把车子和粮食口袋亲自送去。另一方面，他对不是干部的贫农，作威作福，时常以停止推车来威胁，随便责备他们。村里召集什么会议，往往因为好些人推车做生意去了，没法开成。有时人召集齐了，到会的人又催促快些结束，说是要到苏继云那里去开会，商量推车做生意的事情。有的富农，不仅自己做生意，还借钱给贫农，去翻腾粮食。县里派去的工作组，无法展开工作，召集团员、干部等等会议，也不易开成，因为都去推车子做生意去了。而且工作组的同志，在村里工作，找不到饭吃，无法安身。类此情形，别个村子，更是不少。这就是由于农民跟着富农走上资本主义的道路，必然要产生的奇怪现象。
    另外，富农和富裕中农又大量用白米喂猪，好赚更多的钱。因为一斤白米喂猪，可长一斤猪肉，一斤白米只卖七八分钱，一斤猪肉可卖三角多钱。富农富裕中农大事养猪，平均一天一条猪，要喂二斤白米。有好些富裕中农，本是余粮户，应该有米出售的，就因大量用米喂猪，反而变成缺粮户了，要向市场买米。这样下去，必然造成粮荒现象。
    我深切地感到，如果没有统购统销这一政策，农村的资本主义势力，真会像洪水一样地泛滥起来，使许多农民淹没其中，受到很大的灾难。今天有好些农民回想到统购统销前的情形，都感叹地说：“如果不来个统购统销，我连田都卖了。”
    可是富农由此断了发财之路，就死不甘心，在统购时设法抵抗，统购后又要找机会反攻，恢复他们的自由买卖。同时地主及一批被管制过的分子，也趁机会捣乱，故意造成粮荒，使农民不满意人民政府。有些富裕中农，原是跟着富农做生意的，也想再做买卖，伙着叫喊缺粮。
    富农最恶毒的办法，便是唆使村干部反对政府的政策。像清流乡九村八组的富裕中农吴曾树是个拥军优属委员，在统购时，带领好些女人，到村办公室，放声大哭，说自己不能多卖粮食，不然就会饿死，惹得别的女人也哭起来了。估计他的产量，可卖一二○○斤，他却只卖九○○斤。若再扣去他早在粮食市场买来囤积的七○○斤米，实际他只卖了二○○斤米。他的哭，完全是伪装的。到了后来，整顿统销工作，分清敌我界限时，他才自行检讨，说是受了富农寗交东唆使，因为他和寗交东一向都是在一道做囤米生意的。到一九五四年第二次统购时，他才依照产量卖出了一二○○斤米。这件哭闹事情，正说明了富农的阴险。而跟着吴曾树哭的十八户人中，就有四户是富农。
    在一九五四年春天夏天时候，富农唆使干部闹缺粮。如清流乡十四村的党员丘云兴，在群众大会上，说自己粮足，保证不闹粮，不买米。青年团员刘太贵伙同五六人，到丘云兴家中，坐在灶上，嚷着要丘云兴供给饭食，使丘的家人不敢烧火煮饭。别的有粮的农民，害怕起来，明明有粮，也不得不说缺粮。后来刘太贵在团的会上检讨，说是由于同富农的女儿闹恋爱受了富农的唆使，故而乱闹。实际他自己是有米的，并不缺粮。
    地主、富农也有直接嚷叫缺粮的。清流乡十四村的富农陈宏庆，嚷着自己没有米吃，还骂村干部，又向村干部说：“查出有米，你们砍我的头。”又煽动农民说：“共产党来了不好，没有米吃，还做啥子活路。”后来在他家检查卫生，发现他枕头里面藏有米，床上席子底下也藏有米。清流乡十二村最先闹缺粮的地主涂成元、涂官寿，也是把米到处藏起，给检查卫生的农民全部发现。
    富农、地主和一批被管制过的分子，还到街上抢买挂面、锅魁；甚至农民挑到街上去卖的小菜，也拦路抢购，故意造成粮荒空气，使好些中农、贫农都不安起来，恐怕以后当真买不到米，不如现在先买点的好，因此也跟着说粮缺。
    在这闹粮期间，富农、地主以及反动会道门分子，乘机制造谣言，一贯道还印有传单，煽惑农民。传单上说：“空空空，白米要集中，饿死贫穷汉，气死富家翁。”富农拿着这样的传单悄悄念给农民听，还说：你看，现在不是实现了吗？我看统购统销的确是气死了富农，但贫穷汉却没有一个饿死的。贫农在整顿统销后，划分清楚敌我界限，认识清楚闹粮主要是由地主富农和坏分子引起的。老年的农民还说：“这一来我们再不会吃地主富农的亏了。解放前，他们翻腾粮食，整得你好惨。打了谷子的时候，米粮烂便宜，他们就收买。插了秧子的时候，米粮贵得吓人，他们才出卖。如今粮食在国家手里，终年米粮价钱都一样，这是太好了。”
    好多贫农和中农在统购统销期间，坚决拥护人民政府的政策，非常令人感动。他们在统购的时候，不仅老老实实把余粮卖给国家，还要设法多卖，一心只想支援国家工业建设。清白乡五村的乡人民代表李吉明、袁效贞带头节约，设法多吃粗粮，使他们所领导的联组组员，即使有个别真正缺粮的，也不去买一斤半斤米，只是弄些粗粮来吃，在闹粮期间，从没一人跟着别人去闹。
    在一九五三年统购统销前，清白乡和清流乡好多互助组都垮了。而在一九五四年整顿统销工作之后，农民认清闹粮的本质，分清敌我界限，安心生产，重新组织起来，纷纷加入合作社。而那些在统购统销期间坚决拥护人民政府的政策，在群众中起过带头作用的积极分子，大都成为合作社的领导和骨干了。合作社正在稳步前进，小麦大麦产量都提高。好多农民要求加入合作社。有些年老的农民，过去是反对合作社的，也在申请入社。他们一辈子都没有刻过图章，听说申请书上要盖上图章，还特地托人到城里去刻，这可看出拥护合作社的热忱。
    我的家乡正和祖国的广大农村一样，在合作社的道路上，向社会主义社会飞跃前进，但富农和反革命分子，却又改变一种方式，直对合作社进行阴谋破坏，我们在胜利的欢乐中，定要提高警惕呵。
