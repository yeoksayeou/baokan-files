　　Who Can Be Scared by "Baring Fangs and Brandishing Claws"?
　　Jiang Yuanchun
    From July 1st to 3rd, the U.S. Seventh Fleet conducted a large-scale military exercise centered on the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait. On the eve of the Four-Power Conference, when China has repeatedly expressed its willingness to negotiate directly with the United States, and many countries hope to ease the situation in Taiwan, it is no accident that the United States is holding such an exercise to so-called "show strength." This is another deliberate provocation by the American aggressor group against the Chinese people, attempting to maintain and intensify the tension.
    The United States has always adopted a passive and perfunctory attitude towards China's proposal to hold direct Sino-American negotiations to ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region, but it is very enthusiastic about strengthening war preparations in Taiwan and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group in harassing China's coastal areas. The United States is promoting a so-called six-point plan to prepare for the long-term occupation of Taiwan. It is also clamoring to send Marines to strengthen the occupation of Taiwan. This exercise is just one of a series of provocative activities by the United States to flaunt its "strength." In order to make the American people agree to this behavior, the American aggressor group even hinted in its propaganda that China's advocacy of negotiations with the United States was the result of the United States' implementation of a policy of "strength."
    This attitude of the United States proves that what it wants is not the easing of the situation in Taiwan, but further tension, not to seek peace, but to prepare for war.
    As everyone knows, the tense situation in the Taiwan region is the result of the United States' implementation of a policy of "strength," and the fact that the United States was forced to express its willingness to hold negotiations with China, just as it had to agree to convene a four-power summit, was because its policy of "strength" ran into snags everywhere, not only failing to scare the Chinese people and all peace-loving people, but also making itself increasingly isolated. Now, it still wants to cling to that failed "policy of strength," attempting to continue to intimidate the Chinese people and prepare for war behind a smokescreen of "peace." This can only show that it has not learned anything from its failures.
    The United States' use of the Seventh Fleet to "show strength" in the Taiwan Strait is also to intimidate the people of Asia, attempting to force them to submit to the will of the United States. Agence France-Presse, in reporting on the exercise, quoted "well-informed sources" as saying that this massive gathering of the Seventh Fleet could be interpreted as American policymakers harboring a "firm determination" to "appease" the "doubts" (which should be read as opposition) of Far Eastern countries about American policy.
    But can the opposition of the vast number of Asian people to the United States' policies of aggression and war be "appeased" by the United States flaunting its "strength"?
    Baldwin, the military editor of the "New York Times," worried that "Asia is about to believe in the illusion of American weakness," and clamored on March 10th, "The United States is a tiger with claws and teeth," and "Now is the time for the tiger to bare its fangs and brandish its claws." The current provocative activities of the United States are a manifestation of the American "tiger" baring its fangs and brandishing its claws at the people of China and other Asian countries.
    But if a tiger insists on eating people, its claws and teeth are not unbreakable.

　　“张牙舞爪”能吓倒谁？
　　蒋元椿
    从七月一日到三日，美国第七舰队在台湾海峡中举行了一次以澎湖列岛为中心的大规模军事演习。在四大国会议举行的前夕，在中国多次表示愿意同美国直接谈判，许多国家都希望缓和台湾局势的时候，美国举行这样一次所谓“显示力量”的演习，决不是偶然的事情。这是美国侵略集团又一次对中国人民的有意挑衅，企图保持和加剧局势的紧张。
    美国对于中国提出的举行中美直接谈判以缓和台湾地区紧张局势的主张，一直采取消极怠工的态度，但是对于在台湾加强战争准备，支持蒋贼集团骚扰我国沿海，等等，它却非常热心。美国正在宣扬准备长期侵占台湾的所谓六点计划。它还叫嚷要派海军陆战队去加强占领台湾。这次演习不过是美国一系列的这种炫耀“实力”的挑衅活动之一。为了要使美国人民同意它这种行为，美国侵略集团甚至在宣传中暗示，似乎中国主张同美国谈判是美国实行“实力”政策的结果。
    美国的这种态度，证明它所要的不是台湾局势的缓和而是更加紧张，不是要谋求和平，而是要准备战争。
    大家知道，台湾地区的紧张局势是美国实行
  “实力”政策的结果，而美国被迫一度表示愿意同中国举行谈判，正如它不得不同意召开四国首脑会议一样，都是因为它的“实力”政策到处碰钉子，不但吓不倒中国人民和一切爱好和平人民，而且使它自己越来越孤立。现在，它还要抱着那个已经失败了的“实力政策”，企图继续恫吓中国人民，在“和平”的烟幕后面进行战争准备。这只能说明它丝毫没有从它的失败中得到什么教训。
    美国用第七舰队在台湾海峡“显示力量”，也是为了恫吓亚洲人民，企图迫使他们顺从美国的意志。法新社在报道这次演习的时候引用“消息灵通人士”的意见说，这次第七舰队的巨大集结，可以解释为美国决策者怀有“坚强的决心”要“平息”远东国家对美国政策的“疑虑”（应该读为反对）。
    可是，亚洲广大人民对美国的侵略政策和战争政策的反对，难道是美国炫耀“实力”所能“平息”的么？
    “纽约时报”的军事编辑鲍德温因为担心
  “亚洲快要相信美国弱点的想像”，曾经在三月十日叫嚷说：“美国是一只有爪牙的老虎”，而且“现在正是老虎张牙舞爪的时候”。美国现在的挑衅活动，就是美国“老虎”对中国和其他亚洲国家人民张牙舞爪的表现。
    但是老虎如果一定要吃人的话，它的爪牙并不是打不断的。
