　　Congratulating the 34th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
　　The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party Sends a Telegram to the Central Committee of the CPC
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to you on behalf of the Vietnamese working class, the working people, and all members of the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    For thirty-four years, in the continuous struggle for the cause of national liberation, and in achieving the brilliant accomplishment of establishing the great People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China has set a shining example of applying Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese environment. The great People's Republic of China has today become a pillar in the movement to defend world peace. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are striding forward along the road of building socialism, which is a powerful encouragement to all oppressed nations in the world, especially the Asian nations who are fighting for national independence and world peace.
    The valuable experience of the Communist Party of China is extremely important for the Vietnam Workers' Party, which fought against imperialist aggression and for national independence during the war of resistance, and is currently struggling to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete the independence and democracy of the country.
    The Vietnam Workers' Party is willing to continuously consolidate the close unity with the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other fraternal parties, and strive to learn from the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, because this is one of the guarantees for the victory of the Vietnamese people's just struggle.
    We wish you greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace.
　　　　　　　　　　　　Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party

　　祝贺中国共产党成立三十四周年
　　越南劳动党中央致中共中央电中国共产党中央委员会：
    值此中国共产党成立三十四周年纪念日之际，我们谨代表越南工人阶级、劳动人民和全体越南劳动党党员向您们致以热烈的祝贺。
    三十四年来，在为民族解放事业而进行不断的斗争从而取得建立了伟大的中华人民共和国的辉煌成就中，中国共产党树立了把马克思列宁主义运用于中国环境中的光辉范例。伟大的中华人民共和国今天已经成为保卫世界和平运动的支柱。在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，中国人民正在沿着建设社会主义的道路大踏步地前进，这对于全世界被压迫民族，特别是正在为民族独立和世界和平而斗争的亚洲民族是一个极有力的鼓舞。
    中国共产党的宝贵经验对于在抗战中为反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立以及目前正在为巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国的独立和民主而斗争的越南劳动党来说，是极其重要的。
    越南劳动党愿不断的巩固与中国共产党、苏联共产党及其他兄弟党之间的紧密团结，并努力学习苏联共产党和中国共产党的经验，因为这是越南人民的正义斗争取得胜利的保证之一。
    祝您们在建设社会主义与保卫世界和平的事业中取得更大的成就。
　　　　　　　　　　　　越南劳动党中央执行委员会
　　　　　　　　        一九五五年七月一日
