Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 26th. Public and private textile factories in Shanghai, which account for approximately 40% of the city's total industrial output value, have decided to save 24.2 million yuan for the state in the second half of this year. Among them, the cotton textile, knitting, and reproduction industries, which account for the largest proportion, plan to save 640,000 catties of raw cotton, 2,860 pieces of yarn for reproduction, and 840,000 kilograms of industrial grain in the second half of the year.

In addition to formulating plans to save major raw materials, factories have also set targets for saving coal and electricity, which were not given much attention in the past. When revising their conservation plans for the second time, many factories also planned to save funds by reducing enterprise management fees, saving mechanical and electrical materials, and improving product quality. Nearly 3,000 large and small factories in the knitting, reproduction, and dyeing industries, in addition to vigorously saving cotton yarn, also plan to recycle waste alkali liquor and learn from advanced factories to reduce caustic soda consumption in the second half of the year, which can save 2,100 tons of caustic soda.

Factories have made many efforts to save industrial grain in June and July. The East China Textile Administration Bureau organized workers from weaving factories to learn from the experience of State-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory in reducing sizing rates and saving flour. At present, many factories have approached or reached the level of the No. 5 factory, and the factories under the bureau can save nearly 100,000 kilograms of flour in a month.

    上海市纺织业决定下半年节约二千多万元
    新华社上海二十六日讯　占全市工业产值约百分之四十的上海市公私营纺织厂，决定在今年下半年为国家节约资金二千四百二十万元。其中，比重最大的棉纺织和针织、复制行业计划下半年节约原棉六十四万斤，节约复制用纱二千八百六十件，节约工业用粮八十四万公斤。
    各厂除制定主要原材料节约计划外，对过去不大注意的用煤、用电也订出了节约指标。许多工厂在第二次修订节约计划时，还计划从降低企业管理费、节省机物料和提高产品质量等方面节约资金。针织、复制、染织等行业近三千个大小工厂，除大力节约棉纱外，还计划下半年实行将废碱液回收，学习先进厂降低烧碱用量等经验，可节约烧碱二千一百吨。
    各厂在六七月份对节约工业用粮作了许多努力。华东纺织管理局曾组织织布厂的职工，到国营上海第五棉纺织厂学习降低上浆率、节约面粉的经验。目前，许多厂已接近或达到五厂的水平，全局所属各厂一个月就可节约面粉近十万公斤。
