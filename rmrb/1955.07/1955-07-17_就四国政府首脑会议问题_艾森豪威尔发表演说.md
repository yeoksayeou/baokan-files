　　Xinhua News Agency, London, July 16th: According to a broadcast from London radio: U.S. President Eisenhower has departed from Washington to fly to Geneva. Shortly before his departure, he delivered a speech on radio and television. In his speech, the President guaranteed that he and Secretary of State Dulles would display an attitude of reconciliation and tolerance at the Geneva Conference, because the United States does not seek to impose its way of life on others. The President said, we extend the hand of friendship, and we will do everything in our power to set the whole world on a new path. This road cannot be long, but if we persistently follow this path, it will lead us to a better life.

　　The President said that his mission was unprecedented. It is the first time that a U.S. President has traveled abroad during peacetime to attend such a conference. The President promised members of Congress that he would return to the United States on July 24.

　　President Eisenhower continued, my purpose is to change the spirit that has characterized international relations in the past decade. Past conferences have spent much time discussing details without striving to create an atmosphere that could lead to agreement. It is necessary to understand the other side's point of view. If Bulganin's recent statements reflect the true intentions of the Kremlin figures, then there will be no dispute between the United States and Russia at the Geneva Conference.

    就四国政府首脑会议问题
    艾森豪威尔发表演说
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社伦敦十六日讯：据伦敦电台广播：美国总统艾森豪威尔已从华盛顿启程飞往日内瓦。他在启程前不久曾在电台和电视中发表演说。总统在演说里保证：他和国务卿杜勒斯将在日内瓦会议上表现和解和容忍的态度，因为美国不设法把自己的生活方式强加于别人。总统说，我们伸出友谊之手，我们将尽一切力量使整个世界开始走上新的道路。这条道路不能是漫长的，但是如果我们坚持不渝地遵循这条道路，它将把我们引向更加美好的生活。
    总统说，他的这次使命是没有先例的。美国总统在和平时期前往国外出席这样的会议还是第一次。总统答应国会议员们，他要在七月二十四日返回美国。
    艾森豪威尔总统继续说，我的目的是要改变在过去十年中成为国际关系中特征的精神。过去历次的会议把许多时间花在讨论细节上，而没有致力于创造可以导致协议的气氛。必须了解另一方的观点。如果布尔加宁最近的声明反映克里姆林宫人物真正的心意，那末，美国和俄国之间在日内瓦会议上就不会发生什么纠纷了。
