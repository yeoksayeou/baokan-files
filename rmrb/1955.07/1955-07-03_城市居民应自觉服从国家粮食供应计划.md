    City Residents Should Consciously Obey the National Grain Supply Plan
　　Jiang Wei
    The work of rectifying the unified grain purchase and sales system is now beginning in cities across the country. This is a major event closely related to the lives of urban residents. Doing this work well is of great significance for overcoming grain waste and promoting the rationalization and systematization of urban grain purchase and sales. Every resident in the city should help the country rectify the urban grain purchase and sales work with the attitude of being the master of the country.
    Urban working people generally pay more attention to saving grain in their daily lives and are generally able to accept the state's grain purchase and sales policies; however, on the other hand, it must be seen that there are also serious violations of grain purchase and sales policies among some residents. For example, a considerable number of residents have not purchased grain according to the actual number of people consuming grain and the actual amount of grain needed; some residents have transferred their grain purchase certificates to others for use; a small number of residents often throw away leftover food; and some grain processing operators, in addition to the state's supply quotas, use various methods to exploit loopholes and purchase state grain for speculative activities. Due to the violation of the state's grain purchase and sales policies by some residents, coupled with the relatively loose grain supply in cities, a large amount of grain flows out of various cities every day. In Beijing, from late May to June 10, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 3,777 cases of transporting grain and grain products out of the city were found, involving more than 90,000 jin of grain and grain products. It can be imagined that if the amount of grain flowing out of hundreds of large, medium, and small cities across the country in a month is added up, the figure would be quite alarming. Obviously, if the urban grain purchase and sales work is not rectified and this situation is allowed to continue to develop, it will be extremely harmful to the country and the urban and rural people, and the only ones who will benefit are those who speculate in grain.
    At present, in the rectification of grain purchase and sales work, various cities have adopted new measures of planning supply by household, that is, each household must formulate a grain purchase plan on a monthly basis based on the actual population and the actual amount of grain needed, in the spirit of saving grain, and submit it to the government grain department for approval, and then purchase grain according to the plan. If this measure is implemented well, it can ensure the rational supply of grain needed by urban residents and effectively prevent the waste of grain.
    However, at present, many urban residents have some concerns about the new measure of planning supply by household. Some of them worry that the grain purchase plan is now too rigid, and there will not be enough grain to eat in the future; some people think that it is too troublesome to apply for an increase in the grain supply when guests come, and it is better to set the plan larger in advance. They have a common idea: "It is better to report more than less, and reporting more does not necessarily mean buying more." The root cause of all these ideological concerns is that these urban residents have not yet truly realized the important significance of further implementing the grain purchase and sales policy, and have not realized the great benefits of urban residents obeying the national grain supply plan.
    Whether the urban grain purchase and sales work is done well is primarily closely related to the lives of urban residents. Urban residents are the main consumers of commodity grain, and whether the grain supply in cities can be reliably guaranteed depends not only on the amount of grain controlled by the state, but also on whether urban residents can correctly obey the national grain supply plan. As long as urban residents can obey the national grain supply plan, the state can fully guarantee the reasonable needs of all urban residents. However, if urban residents do not seriously abide by the grain purchase and sales policy, do not assist the government in plugging loopholes in grain purchase and sales, and allow bad behaviors such as speculation, purchase above quota, and waste of grain to develop for a long time, then the result will inevitably lead to an unrestricted increase in the sales volume of grain in cities, and ultimately break through the grain supply plan of the entire city. This is very unfavorable to the country and the urban people and must be resolutely prevented.
    Obeying the national grain supply plan is also of great significance for ensuring the country's socialist economic construction and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Because grain is one of the most important materials to ensure the country's economic construction; whether the grain supply is reasonable is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the national grain supply plan is undermined, it will not only seriously affect the improvement of the lives of urban residents, rural grain-deficient households, and farmers in economic crop areas, but also affect the stability of the entire market prices, thereby affecting the development of the country's economic construction. Therefore, urban and rural people should carry forward the spirit of patriotism and consciously obey the national grain supply plan. Why is it said that the urban residents' compliance with the grain supply plan is closely related to the worker-peasant alliance? The reason is very clear, because urban residents do not produce grain themselves, but consume a large amount of grain. At present, urban grain sales account for more than half of the national grain sales volume. The broad masses of farmers sell the grain they have worked hard to produce to the state to support socialist industrial construction and urban construction, and their contribution to the country is very great. However, if the consumption of grain by urban people is unreasonable and there is waste, it will inevitably increase the sales volume of grain in cities, and at the same time, it will inevitably reduce the sales volume of grain to rural areas or increase the amount of grain purchased, and the result of doing so will damage the production enthusiasm of farmers and cause farmers to be dissatisfied with urban people. This year, the state has implemented the policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, and strictly controls the number of grain that needs to be purchased from farmers in the future. This correct measure has a great effect on encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. However, since the number of grain purchased from farmers by the state is strictly controlled, the grain supply to cities must also be strictly controlled to save grain in all aspects and reduce all unreasonable supplies. The method of planning supply by household currently being implemented in various cities is also to achieve this goal. If urban people earnestly obey the national grain supply plan, it will help the state to reasonably solve the urban grain supply problem, and it will be conducive to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    Furthermore, obeying the state's grain supply plan can not only reduce the waste of grain, but also make the family life of urban residents better and more planned. Many urban residents have this experience: before the implementation of the verified supply by household, there was no relatively accurate plan for eating grain, so some waste was inevitable. After the implementation of the verified supply by household, although a little less grain was bought, the planning of grain consumption was strengthened, which not only saved grain but also saved money, and the grain was still enough to eat. Wang Xiuying, a resident of Yizhongli, Hualou Street, Wuhan City, began to strengthen planning and eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain. The rice consumed in April was 15 jin less than the previous monthly average. She said: "In this way, we can save 180 jin of grain for the country a year, and the family can also save more than one yuan a month." On the contrary, some urban residents cannot eat so much grain, but they have to buy more. As a result, some of the grain rots because it has been stored for too long, and some people have spent more money because they bought more grain. If they want to buy some other necessities of life, they cannot buy them, disrupting the normal arrangement of economic life, which is also detrimental to themselves.
    In order to save grain, every urban resident should carry forward the spirit of patriotism and earnestly obey the national grain supply plan. In particular, the staff and workers of various organs, organizations, and enterprises should become models for urban residents in obeying the national grain supply plan. They should not only consciously abide by the state's grain purchase and sales policies themselves, but also earnestly educate their families and relatives to earnestly obey the national grain supply plan. Every urban resident should consciously help the country do a good job in the work of verifying the plan for supply by household, verify their grain needs figures truthfully, earnestly ensure that they do not buy too much, do not waste, do not hoard, do not resell, do not transfer grain purchase certificates, and supervise each other, and resolutely fight against all behaviors that waste grain and hoard, purchase above quota, and violate the purchase and sales policies, so that the city's grain purchase and sales work will be on the right track.

    城市居民应自觉服从国家粮食供应计划
　　江维
    现在全国各个城市正在开始整顿粮食统销工作，这是同城市居民生活有密切关系的一件大事。做好这件工作，对于克服粮食浪费和促进城市粮食统销工作的合理化、制度化，有重大的意义。城市里的每个居民都应当以主人翁的态度来帮助国家把城市粮食统销工作整顿好。
    城市劳动人民在日常生活中是比较注意节约粮食的，一般地也能够接受国家的粮食统销政策；但是，另一方面不能不看到，目前在一部分居民中间也有严重的违反粮食统销政策的现象。例如，相当多的居民没有做到按实际用粮人数和实际需粮数量购买粮食；有些居民把自己的购粮证转借给别人使用；少数居民经常抛掉剩饭；某些粮食复制业者更在国家供应定量之外，利用各种方法钻空子，套购国家的粮食，进行投机活动。由于部分居民违反国家粮食统销政策，再加城市粮食供应偏松，所以，各个城市每天都有大量粮食外流的现象发生。北京市各区在五月下旬至六月十日间，据不完全的统计，共检查出外运粮食和粮食复制品的事件三千七百七十七起，外运粮食和复制品九万多斤。可以设想，如果把全国几百个大、中、小城市一个月外流的粮食加起来，数字一定是相当惊人的。显然，如果不对城市粮食统销工作进行一番整顿，而让这种情况继续发展下去，那末，这对国家和城乡人民都是有极大害处的，得到好处的，只是那些拿粮食进行投机的人。
    目前各个城市在整顿粮食统销工作当中，都采取了按户核实计划供应的新措施，就是说，每家每户必须根据实际人口和实际需粮数量，按照节约粮食的精神逐月拟出购粮计划，报请政府粮食部门批准，然后按计划购买粮食。这项措施贯彻得好，就可保证城市居民所需粮食的合理供应，并有效地防止粮食的浪费。
    但是，目前有不少城市居民对按户核实计划供应的新措施有一些顾虑，他们中间有些人担心现在把购粮计划定得太死，将来粮食不够吃；有些人认为来客时临时报请增加粮食供应量太麻烦，不如预先把计划定得大些。他们有一种普遍的想法是：
  “少报不如多报，多报不一定多买。”所有这些思想顾虑的产生，归根结底是由于这些城市居民还没有真正认识到进一步贯彻粮食统销政策的重要意义，没有认识到城市居民服从国家粮食供应计划的巨大好处。
    城市粮食统销工作做得好坏，首先同城市居民的生活有密切关系。城市居民是商品粮食的主要消费者，城市的粮食供应能否有可靠的保证，不仅决定于国家掌握粮食的数量，而且也决定于城市居民能否正确地服从国家粮食供应计划。只要城市居民能服从国家粮食供应计划，国家就完全可以保证全体城市居民的合理需要。但是，如果城市居民不去认真地遵守粮食统销政策，不去协助政府堵塞粮食统销中的漏洞，而让投机、套购和浪费粮食等恶劣行为长期发展下去，那末，结果必然使城市粮食销售量无限制地增加，以至最后突破整个城市的粮食供应计划。这对国家和城市人民是十分不利的，必须坚决防止。
    服从国家粮食供应计划，对保障国家社会主义经济建设和巩固工农联盟也有重要意义。因为粮食是保证国家经济建设的一种最重要的物资；粮食供应是否合理，对于国计民生都有重大关系。如果国家粮食供应计划受到破坏，就不仅会严重地影响城市居民、农村缺粮户和经济作物区农民生活的改善，而且会影响到整个市场物价的稳定，从而影响到国家经济建设的发展。所以，城乡人民应该发挥爱国主义精神，自觉地服从国家粮食供应计划。为什么说城市居民遵守粮食供应计划同工农联盟有密切关系呢？道理很明显，这是因为城市居民自己不生产粮食，但却消费大量的粮食，目前我国全国粮食销售量中城市粮食销售量占一半以上。广大农民把辛勤生产的粮食卖给国家，支持社会主义工业建设和城市建设，他们对国家的贡献是很大的。但是，如果城市人民对粮食的消费不合理，有浪费，那就势必要增加城市的粮食销售量，同时也就必然要减少对农村的粮食销售量或是增加粮食收购量，这样做的结果，将会损害农民的生产积极性和引起农民对城市人民的不满。今年国家实行了粮食的定产、定购、定销政策，对今后需要向农民收购的粮食数字加以严格的控制。这一正确的措施对鼓励农民的增产积极性和进一步巩固工农联盟，是有很大作用的。但是，既然国家向农民统购的粮食数字控制得严格了，那末对城市的粮食供应也就必须实行严格控制，做到从各方面节约粮食，减少一切不合理的供应。目前各个城市正在实行的按户核实计划供应的办法，也就是为了达到这一目的。城市人民切实服从国家的粮食供应计划，就会帮助国家合理地解决城市粮食供应问题，就会有利于工农联盟的巩固。
    再说，服从国家的粮食供应计划，不但可以减少粮食的浪费，而且还可以使城市居民的家庭生活过得更好更有计划。很多城市居民有这样的体会：在实行按户核实供应以前，吃粮食没有比较准确的计划，因此，也就不可避免地有些浪费。实行核实计划供应以后，虽然稍微少买了一些粮食，但由于加强了吃粮的计划性，不但节省了粮食又节省了钱，而且粮食仍然够吃。武汉市花楼街亿中里居民王秀英家开始加强计划性、消除浪费粮食的现象以后，四月份消费的大米就比以前每月的平均数减少了十五斤，她说：“就这样，一年也能为国家节省一百八十斤粮食，而且家里一个月还能节省一块多钱。”和这相反，有些城市居民本来吃不了那么多的粮食，也偏要多买些，结果有的因为把粮食囤放的时间长了，霉烂了，有的因为多买了粮食，多花了钱，想买一些其他的生活必需品也不能购买，打乱了正常的经济生活的安排，这样做对自己也是不利的。
    为了节约粮食，每个城市居民都应该发扬爱国主义精神，切实地服从国家粮食供应计划。特别是各机关、团体、企业的工作人员和职工应当在服从国家粮食供应计划方面成为城市居民的模范。他们不但自己要自觉地遵守国家粮食统销政策，而且还要认真地教育自己的家属和亲友切实服从国家粮食供应计划。每个城市居民都要自觉地帮助国家做好按户核实计划供应工作，实事求是地核实自己的需粮数字，认真做到不多购，不浪费，不囤储，不转卖，不转借购粮证，并且互相进行监督，坚决向一切浪费粮食和囤积、套购等违犯统销政策的行为进行斗争，使城市的粮食统销工作走上轨道。
