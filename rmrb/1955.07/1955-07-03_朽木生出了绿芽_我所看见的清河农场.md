　　Decayed Wood Sprouts Green Shoots
　　——What I Saw at Qinghe Farm
　　National People's Congress Representative　Cao Yu
    Before I, as a people's representative, inspected Qinghe Farm, the cruel and ferocious faces of that group of Kuomintang secret agents before liberation flashed through my mind. At the same time, I heard that besides the sentenced Kuomintang secret agents, there were also sentenced robbers, local bullies, habitual thieves, hooligans, corrupt officials, and heads of various secret societies. I had seen this group of people in the old society. They were the dregs of humanity, sucking the blood of the people like snakes. They were not only enemies of the working class, they were enemies of all productive forces. But today, they have been reformed. What force could transform this group of enemies of production into a force of production? Naturally, everyone knows that it is the Communist Party, the Central People's Government's wise policy of labor reform, that has made them like this. But only when I saw with my own eyes this group of criminals who had begun to turn over a new leaf diligently cultivating the fields of the motherland did I truly feel the greatness, the correctness, and the power of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership.
    I remember an international personage from a capitalist country who disagreed with our social system visited a Beijing prison and exclaimed, "You can't tell at all that this is a place to detain criminals. It looks like an ordinary factory, clearly part of the current overriding production movement." This is the estimate of a foreigner. Naturally, to him, saying that our prison is like a factory is already high praise. But he only saw the appearance, still a very superficial observation. He saw people laboring in good conditions, but he did not see these prisoners slowly reforming and becoming new people. In fact, after the resolute implementation of the labor reform policy, our labor reform organs have become "hospitals for reforming thought, schools for cultivating skills." Therefore, any international friend who pays a little attention to our work of reforming criminals, after seeing the miracle of educating a large number of producers useful to society from criminals, cannot help but praise, "This is an extremely correct and most humane policy for treating criminals."
    Anyone who has been to Qinghe Farm will feel like they have arrived in the land of fish and rice south of the Yangtze River. Rows of green trees block the wind and sand blowing from the north. Rice paddies, wheat fields, orchards, highways, livestock farms, crisscrossing canals, and some attached pumping stations, paper mills, rice mills, dormitories, hospitals, and schools present a harmonious scene. Water flows gurgling into the fields, and the ditches are full of fish, shrimp, and crabs. Teams of people labor honestly under the red flag. If you didn't know beforehand that this was a labor reform place, no one would be able to tell that this was a group of criminals who had committed crimes.
    Under the diligent management and education of our staff, this group of criminals has begun to develop labor habits, learn various production techniques, and some even actively think of ways to improve operations in labor production. They already know how to fertilize, harrow, plow, transplant rice seedlings, release water, and raise pigs and cattle. Some have learned how to make paper, some have learned how to drive tractors, and some have even created labor tools to improve production efficiency. Many of them have learned specialized agricultural technology, fruit tree gardening, and some have even learned veterinary medicine. Many criminals were illiterate when they came in, and now there are basically no illiterates among these criminals. All those who are released after serving their sentences have at least learned a production skill, so that they can become a new person useful to society in the future.
    Educating criminals is truly an arduous and complex task. This group of criminals who used to ride on the backs of the people and plunder the fruits of the people's labor has always despised and hated labor. Think about how difficult it is to talk about being a new person in the new society to a military intelligence agent who murdered and set fires, a pimp who trafficked in people, a swindler, and some robbers and local bullies who have always been selfish, ruthless, and vicious. Without scolding or hitting people, our people's cadres work on this group of people day and night, sincerely reasoning with them, so that they gradually realize the crimes they committed in the past, how ugly and shameful it was to ride on the heads of the working people. These people have been organized, and they have also begun to use criticism and self-criticism among themselves. On the blackboard newspapers, they have also learned to praise criminals who work hard and criticize criminals who are lazy and slack off under reasonable and humane labor conditions. Working during the day and studying at night, our cadres personally go to the fields and patiently teach them in order to make this group of criminals learn to work. The farm has opened training courses on production technology and political theory for them, and our cadres conscientiously implement the policy of "combining punishment with ideological reform, combining labor production with political education." These criminals have begun to understand that labor is glorious, exploitation is shameful, and some have shown a spirit of meritorious service to atone for their crimes in thought and action. They have been welcomed by the people and released early. The tortuous and complex process from criminals not knowing how to work to knowing how to work, from hating labor to having labor habits, from low labor efficiency and poor quality to high labor efficiency and good quality, truly requires our excellent revolutionary cadres to devote great efforts selflessly.
    However, the most significant achievement is that this group of criminals has gradually become clear in their political thinking. After labor reform, they no longer want to do evil, begin to establish new moral concepts, and recognize the unshakable power of the people's democratic dictatorship. They personally experience the greatness and correctness of the labor reform policy. One fact can illustrate the achievements of labor reform, that is, when criminals are released upon completion of their terms, looking at this friendly farm, the green fields, orchards, and grasslands they have cultivated, this place full of culture and peaceful labor that has transformed them from a rotten life into a new person, they are reluctant to leave this lovely place that has given them new life. They are unwilling to leave again, and they ask to bring their wives, children, and old parents to the farm, and from then on be a good person in the new society. This year, Qinghe Farm has released 642 criminals, and 453 of them have voluntarily stayed on the farm, accounting for 72 percent of the released. These people who have obtained freedom have been approved by the farm to become employed personnel who stay on the farm. The rest, after returning home, their parents and wives are amazed to see these new people whose thinking has changed and who have developed labor habits. They say:
  "The People's Government is truly our good government. It has reformed our husbands and children, transforming a bad person who is not tolerated by the new society into a good person, bringing us true happiness."
    Before the criminals came, Qinghe Farm was originally a barren land. Qinghe Farm moved in, and this boundless wasteland became fertile farmland, and it is visibly becoming a beautiful place suitable for animal husbandry and horticulture. The great work of Qinghe Farm is not only to reform people, but also to transform nature.
    The achievements of Qinghe Farm make me deeply feel the new humanistic spirit of communism. It illustrates the invincible and positive power of great communism. It makes decayed wood sprout green shoots and turns social scum into useful people for society. But seeing these criminals, I cannot help but think of the "predecessors" of these criminals, how they harmed Communist Party members and progressive revolutionary workers in the Shangrao concentration camp, the Sino-American Cooperation Organization, or other similar places in those years. Today's work at Qinghe Farm, while demonstrating the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy, can only truly demonstrate its positive significance under the premise of severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Such criminals, while being counter-revolutionary before being reformed, are still counter-revolutionary when they cannot truly honestly bow their heads and admit their guilt and start anew during or after the reform. An enemy can only be considered no longer an enemy when he completely surrenders. Today, there are still many counter-revolutionaries who continue to be enemies of the people and are unwilling to surrender to the people, and many people among us have developed an extremely dangerous sense of complacency. We must be vigilant. Only by eradicating all hidden counter-revolutionaries can we better defend our great socialist cause.

　　朽木生出了绿芽
　　——我所看见的清河农场
　　全国人民代表大会代表　曹禺
    我在作为一个人民的代表到清河农场视察之前，我脑子里就闪出那群国民党特务在解放之前的那付残酷凶恶的面目。同时我听说，那里面除了判刑的国民党特务，还有判刑的抢匪、恶霸、惯窃、流氓、贪污分子和各种会道门的头子。这批人，我在旧社会是看见过的。他们是人的渣滓，像蛇一样，吮吸着人民的鲜血。他们不只是工人阶级的敌人，他们是一切生产力量的敌人。但是，今天他们被改造了。是什么力量能够使这群生产者的死敌，变成为生产的力量。自然，谁都知道，这是共产党，是中央人民政府英明的劳动改造政策，才会使他们如此。但是只有亲眼看见了这批开始改邪归正的罪犯在祖国的田地上认真地耕种着的时候，我才真正感觉到中国共产党伟大、正确的领导和力量。
    我记得，有一个从资本主义国家来的，并不同意我们的社会制度的国际人士参观北京的监狱之后，他赞叹着：“这里一点看不出是一个拘押罪犯的地方，这像是一个普通的工厂，显然是当前压倒一切的生产运动的一部分。”这是外国人的估计。自然，说我们的监狱像工厂，在他看来，已经是很高的赞扬。但他仅仅看到了外表，仍是一个极肤浅的观察。他看见了人在好的条件下劳动，他没有看见这样的犯人正在慢慢地改造，成为新人。事实上，在劳动改造政策坚决贯彻之后，我们的劳动改造机关已经成为“改造思想的医院，培养技术的学校”。因此，凡是稍稍注意我们的劳动改造罪犯的工作的国际朋友，他们看了从罪犯里居然大量地教育出对社会有用的生产者的奇迹，都忍不住赞扬说：“这是极正确的和最人道的对待罪犯的政策。”
    凡是到过清河农场的人，都会感到自己像是来到了江南的鱼米之乡。绿树成行，阻挡着自北吹来的风沙。稻田、麦地、果园、公路、畜牧场、纵横的水渠、以及附设的一些扬水站、造纸厂、碾米厂、宿舍、医院、学校，呈现了一片和穆的景象。水汨汨地向田里流着，沟渠里满是鱼虾和螃蟹。一队一队的人在红旗下面老老实实地劳动着。如果事先不知道这是一个劳动改造的地方，谁也看不出来这是一群犯过罪的犯人。
    这批犯人，在我们工作人员辛勤的管理教育之下，开始养成了劳动习惯，学会了各种生产技术，有的甚至在劳动生产中积极地想办法，改进了操作。他们已经懂得如何施肥、耙地、?地、插秧、放水、饲养猪牛。有的学会了造纸，有的学会了驾驶拖拉机，有的甚至于创造了劳动的工具，提高生产的效率。他们很多人学会了专门的农田技术，果树园艺，还有的学会了兽医。很多犯人进来时目不识丁，现在这些罪犯里基本上已没有了文盲。凡是刑满释放的人，都至少学会了一种生产技术，使他今后能够成为一个对社会有用的新人。
    对犯人的教育真是一种艰苦而复杂的工作。这批原来骑在人民头上和抢夺人民劳动成果的罪犯，从来是鄙视、仇视劳动的。想想，对于一个杀人放火的军统特务，买卖人口的窑棍，诈骗成性的一贯道坛主，和一些从来就是自私自利、残狠毒辣的抢匪恶霸，讲在新社会做新人的道理，是如何的困难。不骂人，不打人，我们的人民的干部就一点一滴地在这群人身上昼夜不息地做工作，诚恳地跟他们讲道理，使他们逐渐认识了自己过去所犯的罪恶，骑在劳动人民头上是如何的丑恶，可耻。这些人被组织起来了，他们之间也开始运用了批评和自我批评。在黑板报上，他们也学会了表扬认真劳动的犯人，批评那些在合理的、人道的劳动条件下还偷懒怠工的罪犯。白天做工，晚上学习，我们的干部为了使这群犯人学会劳动，亲自下地耐心地教他们。农场为他们开了生产技术讲习班和政治理论的学习，我们的干部认真地执行着“惩罚与思想改造相结合，劳动生产与政治教育相结合”的方针，这些犯人们开始明白劳动是光荣的，剥削是可耻的，有的从思想和行动中表现出来立功赎罪的精神，他们就受到了人民的欢迎，提前释放。犯人们由不会劳动到会劳动，由仇视劳动到有了劳动习惯，由劳动效率低、质量坏，到劳动效率高、质量好，这一段曲折复杂的过程，确实需要我们优秀的革命干部忘我地投下极大的力量。
    然而最显著的成果是这批犯人在政治思想上逐渐明白起来。他们经过了劳动改造之后，已经不想为非作歹，开始树立新的道德观念，认识了人民民主专政的不可动摇的力量。他们亲身体会到劳动改造政策的伟大和正确。有一件事实可以说明劳动改造的成就，就是犯人在期满释放的时候，看着这亲切的农场，经过自己操作的绿绿的田野，果林和草地，这充满了文化与和平的劳动，使自己从腐烂不堪的生活变成了一个新人的地方，他们就舍不得这个可爱的使他们获得新生的场所。他们不愿意再离开，他们要求把自己的妻儿老小也接到农场里，从此做一个新社会的好人。今年，清河农场已经释放的犯人有六百四十二名，自愿留场的就有四百五十三名，占释放人数的百分之七十二。这些得到自由的人被农场批准了，做了留场的就业人员。其余的到家以后，他们的父母妻子都惊叹地望着这些思想有了转变，养成了劳动习惯的新人，他们说：
  “人民政府真是我们的好政府，它改造了我们的丈夫、孩子，把一个不容于新社会的坏人改造成为好人，给我们带来了真的幸福。”
    清河农场在罪犯未来之前，原是一片不毛之地。清河农场搬来了，这块一望无边的荒地就成了产粮的良田，而且眼看着就成为一个风景优美，适宜于畜牧和园艺的地方。清河农场的巨大工作不只是改造了人，并且改造了自然。
    清河农场的成就，使我深深感到共产主义的新的人道精神，它说明了伟大的共产主义的无坚不摧的积极力量，它使朽木生出了绿芽，使社会渣滓成为社会上有用的人。但是看见了这些罪犯，我不由得想起这些罪犯的“前身”，当年如何在上饶集中营，中美合作所，或其他类似的地方，残害共产党员和进步的革命工作者们。今天清河农场的工作，固然表现了党的政策的伟大和正确，但这种人道主义的精神也是在严厉地镇压反革命的前提下，才能真正表现出它的积极的意义。这样的罪犯，在未改造之前固然是反革命，但是当他在改造中或者改造后还不能真正老老实实低头认罪，重新做人的时候，他还是反革命。敌人只有在完全投降的时候，才能把他不再当成敌人。在今天，依然有许多反革命分子继续同人民为敌，不甘心向人民缴械，而我们中间有不少人却滋长一种极端危险的太平麻痹情绪。我们必须提高警惕。只有把一切暗藏的反革命分子铲除干净，才能更好地保卫我们伟大的社会主义事业。
