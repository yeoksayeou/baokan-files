    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 12th (TASS): According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, on July 6th, while a Bulgarian border patrol was patrolling the border in the area 500 meters southeast of the village of Sri Varevo in the Marko-Tarnovo region, 250 meters from the bank of the Rezvaya River, they were suddenly fired upon by two Turkish soldiers on Turkish territory.
    Later the same day, three Turkish soldiers located on the Turkish bank of the Rezvaya River fired upon a Bulgarian border patrol. Sergeant Stoilov was seriously wounded in the chest and died immediately.
    The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said that, because Turkish soldiers groundlessly fired upon the patrol carrying out its duties in Bulgarian territory, resulting in the death of a son of Bulgaria—a border soldier, we cannot but regard this as a conspiracy, deliberately opposing the efforts to improve Bulgarian-Turkish relations and establish mutual trust between the two countries.
    The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said: There is no doubt that this despicable act has the nature of a provocation against the cause of peace forces that are striving to ease international tensions and build trust among nations.
    The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said: The Bulgarian public has the right to expect that, as a result of the note issued by the Bulgarian government regarding the killing of our border soldier, the Turkish side should take resolute measures to stop such serious and dangerous actions and bring the perpetrators to justice.

    土耳其士兵在保土边境挑衅
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社索非亚十二日讯：据保加利亚通讯社报道：七月六日，保加利亚边防警备队在边境巡逻时，在马尔科—第尔诺夫州斯里瓦列沃村东南五百公尺、离列兹瓦雅河岸二百五十公尺的地方，遭到在土耳其领土上的两个土耳其士兵突然的射击。
    同一天较晚的时候，位在土耳其境内列兹瓦雅河岸的三个土耳其士兵向保加利亚边防警备队射击。上等兵斯托伊洛夫的胸部遭到重伤，随即逝世。
    保加利亚通讯社说，由于土耳其士兵对在我们保加利亚境内执行任务的警备队进行无端的射击，结果，保加利亚的一个儿子——一位边防军兵士被打死了，我们不能不认为：这是一种阴谋行动，它首先是蓄意反对为改善保土两国关系以及建立两国的互相信任所作的努力。
    保加利亚通讯社说：毫无疑问，这种卑鄙的行为带有向正在为缓和国际紧张局势、为建立各国之间的信任而努力的和平力量的事业挑衅的性质。
    保加利亚通讯社说：保加利亚公众有权利期望：由于保加利亚政府发出的关于我们的边防军被杀害的照会，土耳其方面应当采取制止这类严重的危险行动的坚决措施，并且使肇事人归案法办。
