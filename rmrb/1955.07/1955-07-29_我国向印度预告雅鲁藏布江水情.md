Xinhua News Agency, July 28th. In response to a request from the government of the Republic of India, the government of the People's Republic of China has instructed relevant departments to report the hydrological conditions of the Yarlung Tsangpo River to India, in order to assist the Indian government in flood prevention work downstream (the Brahmaputra River) within Indian territory. Starting from July 21st, the Chinese Tibet Hydrological Station, in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the Chinese and Indian governments, has been comprehensively telegraphing the water conditions measured by three hydrological stations along the Yarlung Tsangpo River within China to the Indian side daily. This is another measure of contact and cooperation in water conservancy between China and India, following the Indian government's dispatch of water conservancy experts to China for investigation in 1954.

    我国向印度预告雅鲁藏布江水情
    新华社二十八日讯　中华人民共和国政府应印度共和国政府的请求，已指示有关部门向印度测报雅鲁藏布江的水文情况，以协助印度政府在流入印度境内的这条河下游（布拉马普特拉河）进行防汛工作。从七月二十一日起，中国西藏水文站，根据中印两国政府所议定的办法，已将中国境内沿雅鲁藏布江的三个水文站所测水情，逐日综合电告印度方面。这是继一九五四年印度政府派遣水利专家来中国考察后，中印两国在水利方面进行联系和合作的又一措施。
