This declaration formulates solutions acceptable to most people around the world. We call on all social groups and every citizen to study this declaration and to send letters or telegrams to the Geneva Conference to express their congratulations. It is no secret that some people do not want the conference to succeed. Therefore, every congratulatory letter and telegram is support for the participants in the conference.

    声明进一步指出，全世界人民都希望这个即将举行的会议能获得成就。声明说：最近几个月来，苏联政府已经采取了许多步骤，用事实证明了它是要求和平的。声明要求英国政府注意苏联这些非常现实的保卫和平事业的步骤，抱着决心求得和好和妥协的精神到日内瓦去，而不要被参加谈判的西方国家间事先的协定所束缚。

    声明说：赫尔辛基世界和平大会发表的宣言号召各国公众保证日内瓦会议成功。这个宣言拟订了世界各地大多数人都可以接受的解决办法。我们号召各社会团体和每一个公民都来研究这个宣言，并且写信或者打电报给日内瓦会议表示祝贺。有人不希望这次会议成功，这已经不是什么秘密了。因此，每一封祝贺的信和电报，对于参加会议的人都是支持。
    乌拉圭和平委员会通过决议
      乌拉圭全国和平委员会在蒙得维的亚举行会议，讨论进一步扩大保卫和平运动和反对原子战争威胁等问题。会议通过了一项决议，决定打电报给即将举行的日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议，支持用谈判的方法来解决国际问题的主张。
