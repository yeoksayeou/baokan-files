Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 24th: The Shaanxi Provincial Soil and Water Conservation Committee has formulated a fifteen-year soil and water conservation plan for the Yellow River basin within Shaanxi Province. Upon completion of this plan, it is estimated that the amount of sediment carried into the Yellow River will be reduced by approximately 244 million tons annually, accounting for about 40% of the total annual sediment input into the Yellow River from Shaanxi Province. This will play a significant role in controlling the Yellow River and developing production, irrigation, power generation, transportation, and other sectors in the Yellow River basin.

The soil and water conservation work outlined in the plan includes improving cultivation techniques and implementing field projects on over 52 million mu of cultivated land; afforestation of over 14 million mu and the construction of numerous dams for water storage. In the Yulin Special District, where trees are scarce, wind erosion is severe, and drifting sand and soil erosion are serious, windbreaks and sand-fixation forests will be established to stabilize the shifting sands, protect slopes, and prevent the southward movement of drifting sand and soil erosion. In the Suide Special District, where water erosion is severe, in most loess hilly areas of the Yulin and Yan'an Special Districts, and in the loess plateau areas of the Weinan and Baoji Special Districts, where there are steep slopes and gullies, deep plowing and close planting, crop rotation with grass, cessation of cultivation on steep slopes, and the construction of terraces, interception ditches, and other field and gully projects will be widely implemented to protect slopes, consolidate gullies, and preserve the Yuan, so as to improve soil structure, enhance soil infiltration capacity, eliminate or mitigate runoff erosion, and fundamentally change the soil and water loss situation in these areas.

Upon completion of the above plan, the natural conditions and economic outlook of the Yellow River basin in Shaanxi Province will be greatly improved. At that time, a large amount of fertile land, small-scale water conservancy projects, forests, and pastures will appear in this region. In terms of agricultural production alone, due to the increase in unit area yield after soil improvement, coupled with the grain produced from the over six million mu of cultivated land expanded during the project through methods such as reclaiming raw and ripe wasteland, building dams to create silted land, and diverting water from barren sands to flood the land, the annual grain output in these areas will increase by 84% compared to 1952, reaching approximately 94.8 million jin annually.

This plan spans from 1953 to 1967. To date, some of the work outlined in the plan has already been completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 25th: In order to vigorously cooperate with the comprehensive control of the Yellow River and change the arid face of the mountainous areas, Gansu Province has formulated a fifteen-year long-term plan for soil and water conservation in mountainous areas. This plan stipulates that within fifteen years, 40 million mu of mountain and Yuan land in the eastern and central loess plateau areas should be completed with soil and water conservation field projects, 260 million cubic meters of river and gully consolidation projects should be built in the gullies, and 2.4 million mu of water-flooded land should be developed. In the sloping land and mountain gullies with relatively serious soil erosion throughout the province, 5.55 million mu of pasture such as alfalfa and sweet clover should be planted, and 9.978 million mu of water source forests, bank protection forests, economic forests, slope protection forests, and sandbreak forests should be established in the Yellow River tributaries such as the Jing River, Wei River, and Zuli River, as well as in mountainous areas. Furthermore, afforestation and forest closure of 10.188 million mu should be carried out in the forest areas such as Helan Mountain in the north, ZiWu Ridge in the east, and Qilian Mountain in the west. This plan was compiled based on the results of soil and water conservation experiments conducted in Tianshui, Qingyang, Pingliang, and other places, and through investigations and research in coordination with relevant departments such as agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and animal husbandry.

After the completion of this plan, the occurrence of soil erosion in most areas of the Gansu Loess Plateau will be basically stopped, the sediment in the middle and upper reaches of the Jing River and Wei River and the Zuli River will be greatly reduced, many barren gullies and dry beaches will be transformed into fertile land, and the dry mountains and ridges will begin to turn green. At the same time, if the 40 million mu of mountain and Yuan land in the central and eastern regions that have undergone soil and water conservation increase production by 20 jin per mu, the annual grain output will increase by 800 million jin.

After several years of focused trials, soil and water conservation work in Gansu Province has now been widely carried out in 68 counties, cities, and autonomous regions in the eastern and central regions. In some townships or villages where soil and water conservation work was carried out earlier, the phenomena of drought and soil erosion have been significantly changed. In order to create conditions for large-scale soil and water conservation, the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the Gansu Provincial People's Committee are now preparing to establish a provincial soil and water conservation organization, start training soil and water conservation technical cadres, and are preparing to organize a soil and water conservation visiting group of more than 1,000 people, including responsible workers from various special districts, counties, and districts, and chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, to conduct on-site observation in areas such as Tianshui, Qingyang, and Dingxi, where soil and water conservation work has achieved results.

    陕西甘肃分别制定十五年水土保持计划
    新华社西安二十四日电　陕西省水土保持委员会已经制定出陕西境内黄河流域十五年水土保持计划。这一计划完成以后，每年可减少向黄河输沙二亿四千四百万吨左右，约占陕西省每年向黄河输沙量的百分之四十左右，对根治黄河和发展黄河流域的生产和灌溉、发电、运输等事业都将起巨大作用。
    计划中的水土保持工作，包括：在五千二百多万亩耕地上改良耕作技术和进行田间工程。造林一千四百多万亩和大量筑坝蓄水。在树木稀少、风蚀强烈、流沙和泥土冲刷严重的榆林专区营造防风防沙林来固定流沙，保护坡地，制止流沙南移和泥土流失；在水蚀强烈的绥德专区，在榆林、延安专区的大部黄土丘陵地区，在渭南、宝鸡专区的黄土高原区等陡坡沟壑地区，广泛进行深耕密植，草田轮作，停耕陡坡地，修梯田、修截水坑等几十种护坡固沟保塬的田间工程和沟壑工程，以改良土壤结构，提高土地渗水能力，消除和减缓迳流冲刷，从根本上改变这些地区的水土流失状况。
    上述计划完成以后，可以大大改变陕西省黄河流域的自然条件和经济面貌。那时，这个地区将会出现大量肥沃的土地、小型水利和森林、牧场。仅农业生产一项，由于土壤改良后单位面积产量提高，加上在工程过程中，因采用开垦生熟荒地、打坝淤地、荒沙引水漫地等办法而扩大的六百多万亩耕地所出产的粮食包括在内，这些地区每年的粮食产量将在一九五二年的基础上增加百分之八十四，约年产九千四百八十多万斤粮食。
    这一计划是从一九五三年起到一九六七年止。到目前，已经完成了计划中的部分工作。
    新华社兰州二十五日电　甘肃省为了大力配合根治黄河，改变山区的干旱面貌，已经制定出山区水土保持十五年远景计划。这个计划确定十五年内要在东部和中部黄土高原地区完成四千万亩山地和塬地的水土保持田间工程，在沟壑中修筑两亿六千万土方的河沟谷坊工程，并修水漫地二百四十万亩；在全省水土流失较严重的坡地、山沟种植苜蓿、草木樨等牧草五百五十五万亩，在泾河、渭河、祖厉河等黄河支流和山区营造水源林、护岸林和经济林、护坡林、防沙林共九百九十七万八千亩，并在北部的贺兰山、东部的子午岭、西部的祁连山等林区封山育林一千零一十八万八千多亩。这个计划是根据天水、庆阳、平凉等地进行水土保持试验的结果，在农林、水利、畜牧等有关部门协同配合下经过考察研究而编制成的。
    这个计划完成之后，将基本制止甘肃黄土高原上大部地区的水土流失现象的发生，泾河、渭河的中、上游和祖厉河的泥沙将大大减少，不少荒沟干滩变为良田，干山枯岭开始绿化。同时中部和东部经过水土保持的四千万亩山地和塬地每亩地以增产二十斤计算，每年就可增产粮食八亿斤。
    经过几年来的重点试办，现在甘肃省的水土保持工作已经在东部和中部地区的六十八个县、市、自治区内广泛开展。有些水土保持工作进行较早的乡或村，干旱和水土流失的现象已经得到显著改变。为给大规模开展水土保持创造条件，现在中共甘肃省委员会和甘肃省人民委员会正在筹备成立全省性的水土保持机构，着手训练水土保持技术干部，并准备于最近期间组织包括各专区、县、区负责工作人员和农业生产合作社社长等一千多人的水土保持参观团，到天水、庆阳、定西等水土保持工作已有成效的地区进行实地观摩。
