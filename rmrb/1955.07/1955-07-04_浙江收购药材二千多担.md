Zhejiang Purchases Over Two Thousand Dan of Medicinal Materials

　　Local branches of the Zhejiang Provincial Native Produce Company had purchased over two thousand dan of medicinal materials by June 10th, which will soon be transported and sold to various regions after processing.

　　Zhejiang Province is one of the major medicinal material producing areas in the country, producing over three hundred kinds of medicinal materials. Among them, the annual output of Atractylodes macrocephala accounts for 90% of the country's total output. Zhejiang is the only producing area for Chuan Bei and Yuan Hu. This year, the province's output of Yuan Hu, Chuan Bei, and Mai Dong is about 14,600 dan. The output of Chuan Bei and Mai Dong increased by more than 22% compared to 1954. The Hangzhou Medicinal Plant Cultivation Farm has also cultivated some medicinal materials that were not previously available in our country, such as digitalis, and the quality of the products with the highest quality has exceeded international standards. In order to develop medicinal material production in a planned way in the future, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce jointly held a medicinal material work symposium in early June to study the issue of developing medicinal material production in the future, and planned to expand the planting of seven kinds of medicinal materials, including Yuan Hu, Atractylodes macrocephala, White Peony, Chrysanthemum, and Chuan Bei by more than 6,000 mu in 1956.

    浙江省是全国药材主要产地之一，出产的药材有三百多种，其中白朮年产量占全国总产量的百分之九十。浙江是浙贝、元胡的唯一产地。今年全省出产的元胡、浙贝、麦冬三种药材约有一万四千六百多担，浙贝、麦冬的产量比一九五四年增加了百分之二十二以上。杭州药物种植场还培植成了一些过去我国没有的洋地黄等药材，而且产品质量最高的已超过国际标准。为了今后有计划的发展药材生产，省农业厅和商业厅于六月上旬联合召开了药材工作座谈会，研究了今后发展药材生产问题，并计划一九五六年扩种元胡、白朮、白芍、菊花、浙贝等七种药材六千多亩。　（本报驻杭州记者）
