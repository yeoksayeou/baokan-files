Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Ho Chi Minh, President and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, arrived in Moscow on July 12th at the invitation of the Soviet government.

The Central Airport was bathed in the warm July sunshine. The bright red flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union fluttered on the flagpoles along the tree-lined road leading to the airport. The Muscovites who came to the airport carried bouquets of flowers, all of which gave this meeting a special festive atmosphere. Not long ago, the working people of the capital solemnly and warmly welcomed Indian Prime Minister Nehru here, and today they came again to welcome President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and members of the Vietnamese government delegation. The Soviet people are convinced that the visit of the representatives of the heroic Vietnamese people to the Soviet Union will help further strengthen the friendship between the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

At 5 p.m., several silver twin-engine planes landed at the airport. President Ho Chi Minh and his entourage stepped out of the first plane. Then came warm handshakes and sincere, friendly embraces. Young Pioneers ran to the distinguished guests and presented them with flowers.

Voroshilov and Ho Chi Minh walked towards the guard of honor. At this moment, the national anthems of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union were solemnly played at the airport. After reviewing the guard of honor, President Ho Chi Minh met with the Soviet ministers who had come to welcome him, as well as the ambassadors and ministers of various countries, and greeted the staff of the Vietnamese embassy. President Ho Chi Minh walked to the representatives of the working people of Moscow, who paid tribute to President Ho Chi Minh, and through him to the glorious Vietnamese people who had won victory in their heroic struggle and opened up a bright and vast future for themselves. They paid tribute to the Vietnamese people who are overcoming all difficulties and building a new and happy life.

President Ho Chi Minh warmly thanked the Muscovites for their friendly and warm welcome. Then he stepped to the microphone to speak. President Ho Chi Minh said:

    Respected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union!
    Dear comrades and friends!

The government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very happy and moved to come to the Soviet Union—the fortress of revolution, the fortress of world peace, and the great fraternal country—at your invitation.

Please allow us, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, to express our sincere respect and deep gratitude to the residents of Moscow and to all the Soviet people.

The great October Socialist Revolution pointed out to the Vietnamese people the victorious path of the liberation struggle.

The Soviet Union's policy of defending world peace and its efforts at the Geneva Conference helped the Vietnamese people establish peace on the basis of respect for independence, unity, and territorial integrity.

Now, the Vietnamese people face a major task: to consolidate peace and to achieve national reunification through free and universal elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords. At the same time, we must restore and develop the national economy that has been destroyed by eight or nine years of war in order to achieve national independence and democracy.

We are firmly convinced that in the struggle to achieve these tasks, we will receive help from the Soviet Union, other fraternal countries, and peace-loving people all over the world.

The forces of peace in the world are growing stronger day by day, and the Soviet Union's peace policy is gaining more and more support and approval from countries.

We warmly support the Soviet Union's proposition to resolve international disputes through negotiation and the policy that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully.

We warmly support the joint statement of Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish equal and mutually beneficial relations with its neighbors in Indochina and Southeast Asia, with France, and with other countries in the world, based on the five principles reaffirmed in this statement.

Dear comrades and friends!

Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to all the comrades and friends who have come here today to welcome us so warmly. We are convinced that the visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Soviet Union will promote the further development and consolidation of the friendship between our two countries.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Vietnam and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the Soviet Union!
    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

President Ho Chi Minh's last few words, spoken in Russian, were greeted with a storm of applause from the welcoming people, who shouted "Hurrah!".

Ho Chi Minh and Voroshilov rode in an open car, which was hung with the flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Le Van Hien, Minister of Finance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Kuznetsov, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, rode in two other cars respectively; the remaining guests rode in other cars.

Tens of thousands of people gathered on the roads the delegation was to pass along this evening. Red banners were hung on Leningrad Avenue and Gorky Street, reading: "Salute to Comrade Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam! Welcome!" and "Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!". Many Muscovites held bouquets of flowers in their hands. They shouted welcoming slogans: "Long live President Ho Chi Minh! Long live the glorious Vietnamese people! Long live the friendship between the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union!" (Attached picture)
