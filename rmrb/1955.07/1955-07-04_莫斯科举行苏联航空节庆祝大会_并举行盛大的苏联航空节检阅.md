Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS Moscow, 3rd: The Soviet Ministry of Defense, together with the Moscow Party organization, Soviets, and social organizations, held a Soviet Aviation Day celebration rally at the open-air theater in Moscow Central Park on the 2nd.

Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal of the Soviet Union G. Zhukov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Ye. Furtseva, and Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet M. Yasnov attended the celebration.

Also participating in the celebration were ministers of various Soviet government ministries, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, marshals of the Soviet Union, generals, representatives of Party organizations, Soviets, and social organizations, as well as delegations from the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Yugoslavia, and India who were invited to Moscow to attend the Soviet Aviation Day celebration.

The celebration was presided over by Chief Marshal of the Soviet Air Force Zhigarev.

Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Marchinko, Minister of the Soviet Aviation Industry Dementiev, and Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League Davidov delivered congratulatory messages to air force personnel and aviation industry workers on behalf of the people of Moscow, aviation industry workers, and Moscow youth, respectively.

A congratulatory telegram from the Indian Air Force was also read at the meeting.

A concert was held after the meeting.

Another dispatch: The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union G. Zhukov, issued an order on July 3rd to celebrate Soviet Aviation Day.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: According to TASS Moscow: Moscow held a grand Soviet Aviation Day review on the 3rd.

Before 10:00 AM, the area around Moscow's Tushino Airport was packed with people. Representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, ministers of various Soviet government ministries, science and culture workers, advanced industrial and agricultural producers, and hundreds of thousands of Muscovites gathered here to watch the spectacular air show. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union and delegations from many countries invited to Moscow to attend the Soviet Aviation Day celebration also came here.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government appeared on the reviewing stand of the Chkalov Central Aviation Club, at which point the audience welcomed them with warm, stormy applause.

After the air review began, the first to appear were aircraft carrying flags. The fuselages of these aircraft were adorned with red flags bearing portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the military flag of the Soviet Air Force, the flag of the Soviet Sea, Land, and Air Force Support Association, and the national flags of the sixteen Soviet Union republics.

Next, a team of seventy-six aircraft flew over. They formed neat formations in the sky, spelling out the words "Glory to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

Following them were nine sports aircraft, led by Soviet Hero M. Chichneva and piloted by a group of female pilots, including the housewife Blinova. They performed various advanced aerobatic maneuvers, receiving enthusiastic cheers from the audience.

The formation flight of twenty-four aircraft piloted by amateur pilots earned great admiration. These aircraft were piloted by workers, engineers, students, an artist, and a Moscow subway driver.

Suddenly, the roar of the engines disappeared. Glider pilots began their performance. Gliders formed a circular formation and spiraled down from high altitude to a height of five hundred meters. When the gliders disappeared, model aircraft took off from the green runway. The creators of these aircraft guided these small aircraft with radio control. After flying for a while, they landed at the airport near the starting point.

The audience's attention was drawn to another more interesting performance in the program. A glider with wings designed to vibrate in a unique way was hovering smoothly over the airport. The aerobatic performance by another glider pilot at a height of six hundred meters was even more thrilling.

The first part of the air show concluded here.

In the second part of the air show, air force pilots demonstrated their skills. The first item was an aerobatic performance by jet aircraft. A small silver dot appeared in the distance. A jet aircraft roared over the airport, performing very complex aerobatics. Next, three jet fighters performed highly skilled formation flying. Then, six more flew in. They performed collective aerobatic maneuvers while flying face to face. Next, nine jet aircraft appeared.

Several pairs of heavy jet bombers and fighters flew overhead. Accompanying the huge lead aircraft was a squadron of four jet fighters. As the aircraft flew by in succession, the air vibrated with continuous roaring and whistling sounds. They flew so fast that it was difficult for people's eyes to keep up. These supersonic aircraft are the latest products of Soviet aviation science and engineering.

The third part of the review began with the appearance of forty helicopters. They landed a group of landing personnel on the airfield. Special attention was paid to four two-seater helicopters. This group of helicopters was led by Soviet Hero A. Yerofeyevsky.

The last event in the Aviation Day program was a performance by parachutists. They demonstrated the technique of opening their parachutes ten to twenty-five seconds after jumping out of the aircraft. When the parachutists jumped out of the transport aircraft, hundreds of colorful parachutes appeared in the sky.

Finally, a Soviet jet passenger plane appeared in the sky, at which point stormy applause rang out at the airport.

The air review lasted a total of one and a half hours, vividly demonstrating the growth of Soviet aviation power and the outstanding skills of Soviet pilots, parachutists, glider pilots, and aircraft model makers.

    上午十时前，莫斯科土希诺飞机场周围挤的人山人海。苏联最高苏维埃代表、苏联政府各部部长、科学和文化工作者、工农业先进生产者和几十万莫斯科人集聚在这儿观看精采的航空表演。各国驻苏联的外交使节和应邀到莫斯科参加苏联航空节庆祝会的许多国家的代表团也来到这里。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人在契卡洛夫中央航空俱乐部的看台上出现，这时，观众们以热烈的暴风雨般的掌声来欢迎他们。
    航空检阅开始后，最先出现的是打着旗子的飞机。它们的机身上插着有列宁和斯大林像的红旗、苏联空军的军旗和苏联海陆空军后援协会的会旗，以及苏联十六个加盟共和国的国旗。
    接着，一队七十六架飞机飞过来了。它们排成整齐的队形，在天空中组成了“光荣归于苏联共产党”一行字。
    跟着飞来了九架由苏联英雄玛·契奇湼娃为首、家庭主妇布林诺娃等一批女飞行员驾驶的体育飞机。她们表演了各种高级的飞行特技，受到观众的热烈喝采。
    由业余飞行员驾驶的二十四架飞机的结队飞行，博得了很大的赞赏。这些飞机是工人、工程师、学生、一位艺术家和一位莫斯科地下电车司机驾驶的。
    突然，摩托的吼声消失了。滑翔机驾驶员们开始表演。滑翔机排成圆的队形从高空盘旋下降到五百公尺的高度。当滑翔机消失的时候，飞机模型就从绿色的跑道上起飞。这些飞机的制造者们用无线电引导着这些小飞机飞行。在飞行了一会儿以后，它们又降落到起点附近的机场上。
    观众的注意力被节目中另一个更加有趣的表演吸引住了。一架设计得别出心裁的两翼可以振动的滑翔机正在机场上空平稳地盘旋着。另一架滑翔机的驾驶员在六百公尺的高度作的一次特技飞行表演，更是动人心弦。
    航空表演的第一部分到此结束。

    检阅的第三部分开始时，出现了四十架直升飞机。它们把一批着陆人员降落在飞机场上。人们特别注意四架双座直升飞机。这批直升飞机是由苏联英雄阿·叶罗费耶夫斯基率领的。
    在航空节的节目中，最后是由降落伞运动员表演。他们表演了在跳出飞机十秒钟至二十五秒后才张伞的技术。当降落伞运动员跳出运输机的时候，空中出现了数以百计的五彩缤纷的降落伞。
    最后，一架苏联喷气式客机在空中出现，这时，机场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    这次航空检阅共历时一小时半，它生动地表明了苏联航空威力的增长，表明了苏联飞行员、降落伞运动员、滑翔机驾驶员和飞机模型制造者的卓越技巧。
