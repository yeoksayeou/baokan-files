　　Phibunsongkhram's Absurd Arguments
　　Jiang Yuanchun
    On July 1st, Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram once again made his absurd arguments at a press conference in Bangkok, stubbornly insisting that the Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, China, is a so-called "threat to Thailand," and stating that he "does not trust or have any confidence" in Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that China has no aggressive policies.

    Thai officials have made a great fuss about the Dai Autonomous Region in China, insisting that it is a threat to Thailand, countless times. However, this is clearly a preposterous and absurd argument. Why would the implementation of autonomy by the Dai, a minority ethnic group in China, pose a "threat" to Thailand? Thai officials have never been able to clearly explain this logic.

    In a multi-ethnic country, it is perfectly reasonable to implement regional autonomy in areas where minority ethnic groups live, based on the principle of equality among all ethnic groups. In our country, there are many minority ethnic autonomous regions, not just the Dai Autonomous Region; this is also the case in many multi-ethnic countries. Even in Thailand, there is the Shan State established by the Shan minority ethnic group. The Dai are one of China's minority ethnic groups, and China has established the Dai Autonomous Region in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. What is there to be alarmed about?

    According to Thai officials, it seems that China should abolish the Dai Autonomous Region in order to please those "Cold War" creators. However, not allowing the Dai people to exercise regional autonomy means not treating them equally with other ethnic groups, which means implementing a policy of discrimination and oppression against them, something that the Constitution of the People's Republic of China does not allow. Only countries like the Union of South Africa would implement policies of racial discrimination. Thailand is a country that participated in the Asian-African Conference and should be very clear that the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference condemned such policies of racial discrimination.

    China has no aggressive ambitions towards any country, and the same is true for Thailand. During the Asian-African Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai assured Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wan Waithayakon on this point, and the assurances of our government have always been honored. Premier Zhou Enlai also invited Prince Wan Waithayakon to visit the interior of China to see for himself whether there is any so-called "threat of aggression" against Thailand. As the Prime Minister of Thailand, Phibunsongkhram, if he really has any doubts, he has convenient conditions to see the facts, but he would rather groundlessly shout about China's unfounded "threat" to Thailand, which is puzzling.

    Phibunsongkhram, who has just returned from a visit to the United States, of course knows better than anyone who would be pleased by his shouting. At a time when Asian people are increasingly recognizing the need to unite and strive for peace, freedom, and independence with all their strength after the Asian-African Conference, isn't Phibunsongkhram's shouting a bit jarring?

　　銮披汶的怪论
　　蒋元椿
    七月一日，泰国总理銮披汶在曼谷的一次记者招待会上又发表他的怪论，他硬说中国云南省的傣族自治区是所谓“对泰国的威胁”，并且说，他对于中国周恩来总理所说的中国没有任何侵略政策的话“并不信赖或有任何信心”。
    泰国官方人物在中国的傣族自治区问题上大做文章，硬说这是对泰国的威胁，已经不知道有多少次了。但是，这显然是莫名其妙的怪论。为什么中国的一个少数民族傣族实行了自治，就会对泰国形成“威胁”？泰国的官方人物对于这个道理却从来没有能够说清楚过。
    在一个多民族国家里，根据各民族一律平等的原则，在少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，这是极其合理的事情。在我国，少数民族自治区还有许多，不只是一个傣族自治区；在许多多民族国家中也都有这种情况。就是在泰国，也同样有着少数民族掸族所建立的掸邦。傣族是中国的少数民族之一，中国根据宪法的规定，建立了傣族自治区，这有什么可以大惊小怪的地方？
    照泰国官方人物的说法，似乎中国为了取悦于那些“冷战”的制造者，就应当取消傣族自治区。然而不许傣族人民实行区域自治，就是不把它和其他民族平等看待，也就是要对它实行歧视和压迫的政策，这是中华人民共和国的宪法所不容许的事情。只有像南非联邦那样的国家才会实行种族歧视的政策，泰国是参加亚非会议的国家，应当非常清楚，亚非会议的最后公报是谴责了这种种族歧视的政策的。
    中国对任何国家没有侵略野心，对泰国也是一样。在亚非会议期间，周恩来总理曾经向泰国外交部长旺亲王就这一点提出了保证，而我国政府的保证从来是兑现的。周恩来总理还曾经邀请旺亲王到中国内地来实地访问，看看究竟有没有对泰国的所谓“侵略威胁”存在。作为泰国总理的銮披汶如果真是有所疑虑的话，他是有着便利的条件来看看事实的，但他宁愿无端叫喊什么中国对泰国的莫须有的“威胁”，这就使人大为不解了。
    刚从美国访问回来的銮披汶当然比谁都清楚，他这种叫喊会使什么人感到高兴。在亚非会议以后，在亚洲人民越来越认识到必须团结起来，以一切力量来争取和平、自由和独立的时候，銮披汶的这种叫喊不是有点刺耳吗？
