**Speech by Lai Ruqu (Representative)**

I fully agree with the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and the report by Comrade Li Fuchun "On the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," the report by Comrade Li Xiannian "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report "On the Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China," and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report "On the Comprehensive Plan for the Prevention of Floods and the Development of Water Resources of the Yellow River." The first Five-Year Plan is a major step in building our country into a socialist industrial power. The annual national budget is the material guarantee for the successful implementation of the national construction plan. Building our country into a socialist industrial power is the greatest wish of the working class and the people of the entire nation.

After the report by Comrade Li Fuchun was published in the newspapers, workers in various regions and industries across the country have been studying it seriously and have expressed their enthusiasm and determination to strive for the realization of this plan. Obviously, this plan points out a bright future for the national economy, thereby inspiring and guiding the workers across the country to move towards this bright future.

The successful implementation of the first Five-Year Construction Plan relies on the efforts of the people of the entire nation, especially the efforts of the working class. The enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers are the most important guarantee for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. Labor competitions are the concentrated expression of the workers' enthusiasm and creativity and are also a basic method of socialist construction.

The draft of the Five-Year Plan points out: "In 1957, the increase in industrial output value of state-owned enterprises compared to 1952 will have more than two-thirds coming from the improvement of labor productivity." It also points out: "Labor competitions are an effective method for continuously improving labor productivity and should be continuously promoted to new heights." This is completely correct.

In recent years, labor competitions in our country have been widely carried out, playing a significant role in the recovery and development of the national economy and the completion of the annual plans over the past two years. However, until now, there are still some comrades who do not pay attention to labor competitions. This erroneous understanding exists because the role of the masses has not been sufficiently estimated and because it is not understood that relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses is one of the fundamental characteristics of socialist construction. Another situation is that labor competitions are seen as a means of emergency work, not organized during normal times, but only organized when tasks are urgent or when tasks cannot be completed; and labor competitions are seen purely as overtime work, without understanding that labor competitions should be a regular form of labor. It should be pointed out that the development of labor competitions and the improvement and advancement of production technology are inseparable. In labor competitions, it is necessary to pay great attention to the improvement and advancement of production technology, the improvement of labor organization, and production organization. Of course, competitions do not completely exclude emergency work, but the main point is not emergency work. The third situation is that political education and material rewards are not combined, and in labor competitions, attention is not paid to wage work and the improvement of the wage system. If necessary material rewards are not paid attention to, the enthusiasm of the masses in labor competitions cannot be maintained, and labor competitions cannot become a regular form of labor. The fourth situation is that some comrades do not pay attention to supporting the rationalization proposals of the masses, do not pay attention to the promotion of advanced experiences, and do not take effective technical organizational measures to help the masses improve quotas and break through quotas. Yet, in labor competitions, this is precisely the central issue.

When organizing labor competitions, it is necessary to pay attention to both increasing production and practicing thrift, not just paying attention to increasing output and improving quality, but also paying great attention to reducing product costs. As pointed out in the draft of the Five-Year Plan: "The cost of products is a basic indicator of the quality of enterprise work." Under the people's democratic system, managing the economy with meticulous calculation is the cause of the working people. Therefore, in labor competitions, it is necessary to gradually promote the mass economic accounting of work teams, save raw materials, save fuel, electricity, and pay attention to the maintenance and repair of tools and machines, and extend the service life of tools and machines.

Various forms of thrift ultimately amount to saving labor time—saving active labor and objectified labor, that is, improving labor productivity. The results of thrift in all aspects will be reflected in the improvement of labor productivity.

The workers not only need to save themselves but also need to oppose waste by others.

In the reports of Comrades Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, we heard about many serious instances of waste, and we ourselves have seen many such instances. These phenomena of waste must be thoroughly eliminated under the supervision of the Party, the state, and the masses. Regarding the issue of mass supervision, some comrades do not pay much attention to it, and some comrades even use the implementation of the one-man management system to reject mass supervision. This is incorrect. Mass supervision is a way for the Party and the government to rely on the masses to fight against corruption, waste, bureaucracy, lawlessness, and other phenomena, and it is also a way to attract the broad masses to participate in enterprise management and to rely on the masses to do a good job in production. This is not contradictory to the one-man management system. In some enterprises, after implementing the one-man management system, things that should be discussed with the masses are not discussed with the masses, and things that should seek the opinions of the trade unions are not sought from the trade unions, thinking that "one-man management means the factory director decides." This, of course, cannot be called a true one-man management system. Accepting the correct opinions of the masses and correcting one's own mistakes can make management work better and can further consolidate the one-man management system.

Many enterprises have surplus labor on the one hand and large-scale overtime on the other. Due to the result of overtime and rush work, the health of workers is damaged, the quality of products is affected, and the wage fund is overpaid, resulting in a great waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It should be pointed out that the trade unions have not played or have played very little role in supervising these phenomena, and even some trade union cadres have participated in them.

In recent periods, phenomena such as compulsory orders, punishmentism, and lawlessness have been somewhat rampant in many enterprises. Some factories and mines, when rectifying labor discipline, mainly do not adopt the method of persuasion and education, but mainly adopt the method of punishment. Of course, strengthening labor discipline is very necessary, but the strengthening of labor discipline should be based on the self-awareness of the masses.

In the struggle against waste and the practice of thrift, and in the struggle against bureaucracy, it is necessary to give full play to the role of mass supervision from the bottom up.

While carrying out labor competitions, it is necessary to pay great attention to strengthening the cultural and technical education of the workers.

To build our country into a great socialist nation and to catch up with and surpass the strongest capitalist industrial countries within a few decades, we must have a working class with a certain level of culture and technology. However, our working class is precisely backward in culture and technology. Since the start of large-scale economic construction, new workers have increased in large numbers, and the average level of technical proficiency in many enterprises has declined, which is one of the important reasons for the low quality of products and the high number of defective products. This problem must be solved, and under the leadership of the Party, this problem can be solved. In recent years, the cultural education work carried out by the trade unions has mainly focused on eliminating illiteracy and cultural and recreational activities, while systematic cultural education work has been done very poorly. Recently, we have consulted with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education and have prepared to take some specific measures to strengthen the part-time cultural and technical education of workers from primary school to university.

The above-mentioned points are the important responsibilities of the trade union organizations in giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, striving to improve the cultural and technical level of workers, to improve labor productivity, and to ensure the realization of socialist industrialization.

At the same time, the workers of the entire nation and the trade union organizations also have the responsibility to assist the government in gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, to continuously consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to ensure the complete realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the living conditions of the workers.

Since liberation, with the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity, the living standards of the workers have generally improved. However, there are two situations that should be mentioned:

One situation is that in the past year or so, some new difficulties have arisen in the living conditions of the workers. The difficulties arose because in private enterprises, production is not normal, tasks are insufficient, and some capitalists use the difficulties as an excuse to reduce or delay the payment of workers' wages. In state-owned enterprises, some are due to insufficient raw materials, abnormal production; some are due to poor planning and management, resulting in serious idling and stoppage; more common are the chaotic phenomena in wage work. The funds allocated by the state for welfare and relief have also been used inappropriately in some cases; there are shortcomings in the supply of some necessities of life. This situation deserves the attention of all parties.

Another situation is that the living welfare facilities of some factories and mines are too high, not in line with the current level of production in our country, and not in line with the actual living standards of the workers. For example, some factories have high-standard dormitories, high rent, and workers cannot afford the rent and cannot move in. Therefore, on the one hand, there is a severe housing shortage in various industrial cities, while on the other hand, good houses that workers cannot afford to live in. Many activities organized by the trade unions also have high standards for facilities. For example, the standards for clubs, sanatoriums, and kindergartens are all too high. Due to this situation, a lot of money is spent, but the urgent problems in the living conditions of the workers have not been solved.

In summary, the various problems in the workers' living conditions today are not due to low wage levels, nor are they due to the state spending too little on workers' living welfare, but rather because there are flaws in our work. These flaws in our work must be gradually overcome.

Comrades, our country's first Five-Year Plan has been implemented for two and a half years. The practice of the past two and a half years has fully proven that our country's great plan is feasible. There is no doubt that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the sincere help of the Soviet Union, the Chinese working class will definitely contribute all its strength together with the people of the entire nation to achieve the victory of the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Teng Daifang (Minister)**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report "On the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," and I am determined to strive for their implementation. Now I would like to express some opinions on the Five-Year Construction Plan for railways and on the implementation of thrift, the opposition to waste, and the reduction of construction costs in railway construction.

In the first Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in railway basic construction is 5.671 billion yuan, of which 32.7% is used to strengthen and renovate existing railways, 21.5% is used to increase locomotives and rolling stock, 41.7% is used to build new lines, and the rest is used for the investment in design and construction departments. More than half of the railway basic construction investment in the five years is used to strengthen and renovate existing railways. This investment ratio is in line with the current situation of railway equipment in our country and is also in line with the needs of the state for railway transportation during the first Five-Year Plan period.

Before liberation, most of the railways in our country were built by various imperialist countries as tools of aggression against China, so the number of railways is small, the types and standards of various technical equipment are very complex, and most of them are distributed along the coast, while in the vast interior, especially in the southwestern and northwestern regions, there are either no railways or very few. This backward state of technical equipment and unbalanced distribution of lines, of course, cannot meet the needs of socialist construction for railway transportation, but it is not something that can be completely changed in the first Five-Year Plan period.

After liberation, due to the rapid recovery of the national economy, the average annual transportation volume per kilometer of railway in our country in 1952 has reached 354,000 tons, and it is estimated that by 1957 it will reach 557,000 tons. However, our current railway technical equipment is very backward. Our current double-track lines account for only 6% of the total length of the railway, and the station lines account for 31.5% of the total length. There is not a single hump yard in the transportation hubs. The backward situation of our country's railways indicates two problems: first, it indicates that the workload undertaken by our country's railways is very heavy; second, it indicates that the reserve strength of our country's railways is extremely poor. It must also be pointed out that the 694 industrial construction units above the limit that are newly built and renovated in the first Five-Year Plan period, especially the 156 construction units designed with the help of the Soviet Union, will mostly be completed or start large-scale production in the early days of the second Five-Year Plan. It can be imagined that the railway transportation volume in 1959 and 1960 will increase even more, and all these industrial constructions are mostly distributed along the existing railways. That is to say, the newly increased huge transportation volume still has to be undertaken by the existing railways. This is the main reason why more than half of the railway investment is placed on strengthening and renovating existing railways.

In the first Five-Year Plan period, the number of new railways we build still cannot meet the needs of all parties. Building railways is a huge task, not only requiring a large amount of funds, but more importantly, requiring a large amount of technical strength. Our experience in building railways over the past few years has proven this point. For example, the railway from Fengtai to Shacheng is more than 100 kilometers long, and just the survey and design of this railway, converted, requires the work of 460 technical personnel for a whole year. Therefore, judging from our current and possible training of survey and design capabilities and construction capabilities, the number of new railways built in these five years is not small, and it is basically in line with the overall economic construction. Of course, we, the railway workers of the entire country, should also strive to overfulfill the plan to better meet the transportation needs of the state and the people.

To complete the Five-Year Railway Construction Plan, in addition to mobilizing the broad masses of workers to give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity and ensure the completion of each annual plan, we have also carried out a series of preparatory work for construction. For example, to adapt to the future large-scale transportation needs, we are currently carrying out the standardization of locomotives, rolling stock, and rails; to improve the throughput capacity of busy lines and ensure the safety of train operations, we are currently carrying out the standardization of automatic block and semi-automatic block devices; to better determine the scale and steps of the technical renovation of existing railways, we are currently investigating the utilization of the technical equipment capacity of existing railways on the one hand, and actively carrying out research on the near-term and long-term cargo transportation volume of railways on the other. In the survey and design, over the years, we have also been continuously strengthening the technical strength, modifying the design specifications and design quota standards according to the requirements of reducing costs, and carrying out the survey and design tasks of the new line in Lanxin West of Yumen by using aerial survey to strive to complete the entire survey and design task by the end of 1957. At the same time, we are actively preparing to take measures to strive to complete the railway from Chengdu to Baoji by the end of 1956 and to complete the railway from Yingtan to Xiamen ahead of the original schedule.

Half of the Five-Year Plan period has passed, and in these two and a half years, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the enthusiastic support of the people of the entire country and local Party and government organs, the selfless labor of all railway workers, and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, we have completed 40% of the Five-Year Railway Construction Plan, and at the same time, we have gained some experience and trained a batch of cadres, which has provided a certain guarantee for the implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

Railways are a department with relatively large state construction investment. Therefore, it is of great significance to implement a strict thrift system on railways, oppose waste, reduce construction costs, reduce the standards of non-production construction, learn from the experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, and adhere to the excellent tradition of frugality cultivated by our Party in the long-term revolutionary struggle, and use the state's construction funds frugally.

To implement the central government's instructions on reducing costs, in the second quarter of this year, we organized an inspection team to inspect the new railway construction work in the northwest and southwest regions and found that the phenomena of waste in railway basic construction projects are serious.

First, there is blindly raising standards, especially many non-production constructions that should be small are made large, those that should be few are made many, those that should be low are made high, and even those that are not necessary at all are made. For example, the buildings of stations are too large, there are too many toilets, the price of dormitories is too high, and the price of many temporary sheds is as high as 40 yuan per square meter, named "temporary," but actually can be used for 15 to 20 years. In production construction, there are also phenomena of blindly raising standards, such as the seven pairs of communication wires on the Chengdu-Chongqing line, which can be done with one pair of copper wires, but we used five pairs, seriously wasting the country's non-ferrous metals.

Second, some production constructions are not necessary in the initial operation period, forming premature investment, which is essentially waste. For example, many unnecessary stations have been opened, and some stations have too many tracks laid. In the initial operation period of the main railway lines, laying 1,600 sleepers per kilometer is sufficient, but we, regardless of the initial volume of transportation, uniformly laid 1,840; the thickness of the gravel should be laid at 3.5 centimeters, but we laid it at more than 4.5 centimeters. This blind pursuit of safety factors and premature investment not only disperses the state's construction funds, affects the progress of economic construction, but also increases the cost of major repairs and routine maintenance.

Third, there is a blind pursuit of form, adding many unnecessary projects, causing waste. For example, the buildings along the line can originally use natural terrain, but our design personnel, in order to pursue beauty, insist on placing them all at the same level, doing a lot of unnecessary filling and excavation work. For buildings, a lot of unnecessary modifications are also made, the plain brick wall is originally good-looking and strong, but it is insisted on plastering a layer of cement, which not only wastes money, but also the cement is easy to peel off, increasing the number of future repairs and the cost. The stone used for the piers, abutments, and lining of tunnels along the line, originally only needs to be trimmed about one inch on the four outer edges, but we trim it to six sides, causing the work hours to generally exceed one to two times. Along the Lanxin line, the population is sparse, and in some areas, there is no human habitation for hundreds of kilometers, but we still build guard houses at the crossings and assign crossing guards. Many stations, even in sparsely populated areas, install hundreds of meters of painted fences and concrete platforms.

In addition, due to design technical errors, poor construction organization, failure to pay attention to local materials, low labor productivity, poor management of machinery and materials, and poor quality, serious waste is also caused. For example, the Anchangjiang Bridge on the Baocheng line in Mianyang and Guangyuan sections, due to the improper selection of the bridge site, the anti-flood expenses spent in the past three years have already reached twice the cost of the bridge, and now a new bridge still has to be built, which is a prominent example of serious waste caused by design errors.

The root cause of the above waste is mainly that our leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel lack an economic viewpoint, do not fully understand the importance of the central government's policy of thrift and key construction, and therefore are not clear about the focus of railway investment should be based on the needs of transportation and the idea of serving transportation, causing the dispersion of investment; some, although they understand that the focus of investment should be placed on transportation needs, do not know how to distinguish between current needs and future needs, thus causing premature investment. Secondly, there is a lack of a sense of responsibility to the state, and the construction personnel mechanically follow the design, find waste but do not insist on it, thinking that if there is a mistake, the design will be responsible. The design personnel are afraid of responsibility, raise the design standards without restriction, blindly raise the safety factor, and excessively accommodate the requirements of the user department, causing the state to suffer losses. Third, the arrogance and complacency are also one of the main reasons for the waste. The railway work has achieved some results in recent years, which has made our leading cadres develop a sense of arrogance and complacency, and with this mentality, there will inevitably be blind conservatism, self-satisfaction, and subjective idealism, which will produce a blind pursuit of form, blindly raise standards, and unrealistic style, which is extremely dangerous bourgeois idealism, which must be corrected. The above-mentioned thoughts are inseparable from the low leadership level of the Ministry of Railways and the lack of serious inspection.

To practice thrift, oppose waste, and reduce construction costs, under the guarantee of the progress and quality standards of railway construction, we believe that the following measures must be taken:

1. Mobilize all workers to practice thrift, oppose waste, strive to increase production, reduce construction costs and expenses, and implement the spirit of key construction, adhering to the principle of combining needs with possibilities, and projects that can be done or not done must not be done; projects that can be delayed must be delayed; projects that can be done less must be done as little as possible; projects that are not necessary at all must not be done at all. Through our inspection, it was found that in the construction of new lines, there are ten types of projects that should be cancelled, such as cancelling bridge numbers and writing bridge numbers on the bridge abutments, cancelling railway boundary markers in areas without farmland, etc., which can save a lot of construction funds for the state.

2. Change the overly high design standards. For example, in line design, try to use local river pebbles as much as possible, and the width of the subgrade of non-mainline railways and all branch lines can be reduced to 4.5 or 5 meters according to the soil conditions. In bridge design, small bridges can be without railings, and large bridges can have wooden railings. The foundations of bridge piers that are not frozen and not subject to scouring can be made of lower-grade concrete or ashlar masonry. In tunnel design, the side walls and arches can be replaced with ashlar instead of stone. In building design, attention should be paid to local materials; temporary buildings should be built as little as possible, and the price should be reduced to 10 yuan per square meter; the price of formal buildings should also be reduced, and the principle should be that it does not exceed the limit set by the central government.

3. Revise the design specifications, adjust the design budget, and improve the design technology. The original design specifications should be revised according to the spirit of opposing waste, practicing thrift, reducing costs, and key construction, distinguishing between production construction and non-production construction, and distinguishing between current needs and future needs, and make appropriate revisions. Those that have done too much in the past and have too low labor quotas should be adjusted according to the actual situation. In particular, in the past, very little consideration was given to the use of natural terrain and local materials, increasing a lot of transportation expenses and unnecessary projects. Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine the design documents, examine the degree of utilization of terrain by lines and buildings, examine whether the position of the design of stations and technical equipment is appropriate, examine whether temporary buildings were avoided as much as possible during the design to avoid double expenses, etc. It is necessary to strengthen the economic investigation before design and the terrain, geology, and hydrology investigation during construction and operation, and make a prudent decision on the design projects.

4. Improve the construction organization, strengthen the coordination and cooperation between the three departments of basic construction, design, and construction, and do a good job in construction arrangements. Each construction site must have a unified construction organization design and a unified construction leadership, vigorously promote advanced construction methods such as large-scale blasting, water drilling, and small-scale mechanization, and implement piecework wages, strengthen labor organization, to save labor costs, improve labor productivity; strengthen the management of machinery and materials, fully utilize the use rate of machinery, carefully do the material testing work, increase the number of times the use of formwork, supports, and scaffolding, to save the cost of machinery use and materials; as much as possible, take measures to complete the work ahead of schedule and hand it over for operation under the condition of ensuring quality, to accumulate funds for the state as soon as possible.

5. Streamline the organization, tighten the staffing, and reduce the number of non-production personnel. Stop recruiting new employees and stop converting temporary workers to permanent workers. Resolutely merge all unnecessary and redundant organizations. All railway workers, especially leading cadres, should cultivate a frugal style, not only from the big aspects but also from the small aspects to practice thrift.

According to the above measures, we have drafted 60 specific implementation methods, calculated the railway basic construction work volume from 1955 to 1957, and if these methods are implemented, then the average annual cost can be reduced by 26.9% compared to the original total investment (after deducting the value of rails, steel beams, etc.), and 17.399 million yuan can be saved for the state in 1955 alone.

To comprehensively oppose waste and implement the principle of increasing production and saving, in addition to reducing construction costs, the railways of the entire country must further improve management, actively carry out the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements, accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, improve labor productivity, and require the railway transportation cost in 1955 to be reduced by 1.05% compared to the original plan, the major repair project cost to be reduced by 4%, and the cost of affiliated enterprises to be reduced by 2%. Among the main indicators, the average loading per car is required to be increased by 0.2 tons compared to the original plan, which can increase production by 10,000,000 yuan; the traction weight of locomotives is required to exceed the standard weight by 40,000 tons, which can save 3-4 locomotives per day; the average daily running kilometers of each locomotive are required to be increased by 4 kilometers, which can save 18 locomotives per day. This is the goal of struggle for the railway workers of the entire country in 1955.

At this meeting, the representatives' suggestions on railway construction work, we will study carefully and consider adopting. The representatives' criticisms of railway work, we are willing to guarantee improvement in future work.

To ensure the smooth completion of railway construction and transportation tasks, it is still necessary to carry out the movement to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries on all railways across the country, improve the political vigilance of all railway workers, so as to further review and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, it is necessary to fight against thieves and prevent the loss and destruction of state property.

We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the government, with the support and supervision of the people of the entire country, and under the active leadership and influence of advanced workers within the railway system, we will study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, always with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to expose the shortcomings and errors in our work, and strive to avoid arrogance and complacency, work diligently, and strive hard. We will definitely be able to complete the glorious task given to us by the National People's Congress. We will definitely be able to guarantee the completion of the railway construction and transportation tasks in the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Cai Chang (Representative)**

I fully support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of our country and completely agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports fully reflect the common aspirations of the people of the entire country to build the country and defend peace. They prove that the socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country have taken a step forward and achieved great victories.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a decisive step for the Communist Party of China to lead the entire Chinese people to realize the transitional period's general task and to strive for the construction of a socialist society. The first Five-Year Plan is to take the development of heavy industry as the center and to correspondingly develop agriculture, light industry, transportation, and cultural education. This is completely correct because only by striving to develop heavy industry, develop productive forces, and implement socialist industrialization can there be a material foundation for the transformation of the entire national economy and the improvement of people's lives. The deployment of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce in the draft of the first Five-Year Plan is completely correct and is in line with the actual situation of China. In short, the tasks, policies, and steps of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation stipulated in the draft of the first Five-Year Plan are correct reflections of the transitional period's general task stipulated in our country's constitution. Therefore, the indicators, proportions, and speeds of the development of various undertakings stipulated in the draft of the first Five-Year Plan are also very appropriate. This is an unprecedented great plan in Chinese history, which can inspire and mobilize the people of the entire country to strive to achieve it. The realization of this plan will lay the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country, lay the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Laying these foundations will make the realization of the transitional period's general task more guaranteed, and the thorough liberation of Chinese women will also be more guaranteed. We celebrate the birth of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. We firmly support this plan, and we also fully agree with the resolute spirit of increasing production, practicing thrift, and opposing waste reflected in this plan.

After the group discussion, we feel more and more the greatness of the Five-Year Plan and its close relationship with the long-term and highest interests of the people of the entire country, and we also feel more and more the great responsibility of the people of the entire country to build a socialist material foundation and complete the Five-Year Plan. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have struggled hard, sacrificed bravely, and persevered for decades, pursuing the liberation and happiness of the people. Due to the joint efforts of the Chinese working class and other classes, we have achieved the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution; due to the joint efforts of the Chinese working class and other classes, we have also achieved the victory of the restoration of the national economy and have smoothly entered the period of socialist planned economic construction. These all prove that the Chinese people, for their own liberation and happy future, are determined to overcome all difficulties and complete all tasks. The formulation and implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, a socialist and powerful new China is in sight, so no matter how arduous the completion of the Five-Year Plan is, the people of the entire country, regardless of gender, will definitely work diligently, overcome difficulties, and complete and overfulfill the great first Five-Year Plan.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun called in his report: "Women should also raise their political awareness, improve their production and work abilities, and actively participate in national construction." We firmly respond to this call, we can do it, and we will definitely do it. For the construction of socialism, whether in cities or in the countryside, we will play different roles on different production fronts, in different work positions, and in the vast families, and actively participate in national construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the women of the entire country have already actively participated in the great struggle for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, thus winning a new China with political, social, and economic equality between men and women. We must redouble our efforts to build socialism, consolidate and develop this new China, because only with the continuous development of the economy and the improvement of productive forces, our country can finally eliminate the system of exploitation, our lives can be more happy, our culture can be more advanced, and women can be thoroughly liberated. Therefore, the first Five-Year Plan is precisely a great cause that concerns the vital interests and highest interests of us women. How can we not redouble our efforts to strive hard for its realization?

The women of the entire country, whether they are female workers, peasant women, female workers in various work positions, female students, worker family members, and women of various strata, for the first Five-Year Plan, what is the center of our joint struggle? That is to increase production and practice thrift. Increasing production and practicing thrift is the only way to accumulate funds to build a socialist society, and it is the constant and long-term political task of the people of the entire country. For this, the All-China Women's Federation must launch a production and thrift movement among the women of the entire country to develop production, accumulate funds, and complete the Five-Year Plan. We require female workers in various positions to participate in labor competitions with male workers, to strive for the improvement of labor productivity, the saving of raw materials, the reduction of costs, and the increase of production. We require the broad masses of rural women to actively participate in the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, to continuously improve the yield of grain and industrial raw materials; and under the principle of saving grain, to raise as many livestock and poultry as possible, to increase the production of meat and eggs. We require the broad masses of worker family members and women of various strata, female students, in addition to studying hard, to live a life of diligence and frugality, to cultivate the wind of diligence and frugality in managing the family and the country.

We women have a clear understanding and determination to increase production and practice thrift and oppose waste. We see that on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, a large number of heroes, models, production innovators, and outstanding cadres have emerged; in the families of workers and housewives, there are many models and examples of practicing thrift: some are bravely fighting against corruption and waste; some are meticulously calculating, saving grain, cotton, electricity, gas, coal; some are cooperating with factories and mines to recover waste materials, or are always paying attention to collecting scrap copper and iron, and donating them to the state. These facts not only show that the broad masses of women can contribute their own strength in increasing production and practicing thrift to serve the completion of the first Five-Year Plan; at the same time, they also prove that the enthusiasm and initiative of our women to build a socialist motherland are very high. In the future, the women of the entire country will definitely work harder, continue to increase production, and save more, to accumulate more wealth for the state, and to accumulate more funds for socialist construction.

We must defend socialist construction, and we must also improve our political vigilance. We must be vigilant against the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialist elements, the Kuomintang bandits, and all remaining counter-revolutionary elements. We must be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialists to prepare for a new war. We must respond to the call of the First World Congress of Mothers, unite with women around the world, and join the people of the world who defend peace to fight against war and defend peace.

**Speech by Xie Fumin (Representative)**

I fully agree with and support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, as well as the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun "On the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget."

The state, based on the restoration of the national economy, formulated the first Five-Year Plan, which outlines the scale of our country's great socialist construction in the next five years and, in the specific tasks and measures for various constructions, truly considers the characteristics and needs of ethnic minorities, fully guarantees the political, economic, and cultural rights of ethnic minorities, and implements the spirit of ethnic equality and mutual assistance. We believe that the realization of this great plan will bring greater prosperity and happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, this plan, which guides the people of all ethnic groups in our country to advance along the socialist road, will definitely receive the enthusiastic support of the people of the entire country.

The first Five-Year Plan of our country determines to take socialist industrialization construction as the center, which is completely correct and is in line with the long-term and highest interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. From the perspective of the Zhuang ethnic region, in the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, within the unified family of the motherland, there have been certain improvements and developments in politics, economy, and culture. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production has achieved great increases, and people's lives have improved. However, at present, the economy and culture are still relatively backward, the level of agricultural production is still low, especially in the mountainous areas, the level of agricultural production of the Zhuang and other ethnic groups is even lower. In the first Five-Year Plan, we will fully utilize the natural conditions, pay attention to tapping the potential of production, and agricultural production can still be increased on the existing basis. But from a long-term perspective, to fundamentally change this backward situation, it is necessary for the state to gradually realize socialist industrialization and lay the material foundation for the transformation of the national economy, which can provide the necessary conditions. Therefore, the development of socialist industry, especially the development of heavy industry, is closely related to the development of the economy and culture of ethnic minorities and the happiness of the people, which is also the common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups for a long time.

In the process of implementing the state's first Five-Year Plan, the Zhuang ethnic region, under the unified state plan, and based on specific conditions, mainly follows the policy of increasing grain production as the main task, while developing various economies, and carries out the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation to develop agricultural production and actively support and cooperate with the state's industrialization construction. In the past two years, work has been carried out according to this policy and has achieved certain results. Agricultural mutual aid and cooperation have developed to a considerable extent, with 7,034 agricultural production cooperatives established in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, accounting for 8.6% of the total number of households in the entire autonomous region. Including various types of mutual aid teams, the number of organized households has reached 67.2% of the total number of households in the entire region. On the basis of mutual aid and cooperation, agricultural production has increased year after year, and other industries such as forestry, technical crops, and local specialties have also developed. Roads have been gradually built and repaired, and the recently completed construction of the Lian (Lianzhou) - Zhan (Zhanjiang) railway is of great significance to the development of our economy and culture. These achievements have not only improved people's lives but have also directly supported the state's industrialization construction in terms of grain, timber, and local specialties. The Zhuang people have seen the beautiful future of their own lives and the development of their ethnic groups in their new lives and are working hard for their happy cause.

The formulation of the state's first Five-Year Plan has given us great encouragement. We have full confidence that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we will further strengthen national unity, strengthen the economic and cultural ties and cooperation between ethnic groups, mobilize the Zhuang people and the people of all ethnic groups to deeply study and understand the state's first Five-Year Plan, strengthen the overall concept of state construction, actively participate in the economic construction of the motherland, especially according to the requirements of the state plan, based on our local conditions, strive to do a good job in production, and strive for greater increases in agricultural production, so as to gradually improve the economic and cultural lives of the Zhuang people and provide more support for state construction. This is our urgent task.

Let us strive together to complete or overfulfill the state's first Five-Year Plan!

**Speech by Xia Yixian (Representative)**

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report "On the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget" point out the bright path of national construction and the future work direction, referring to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with the actual situation of our country, taking the development of heavy industry as the key, and gradually building our country in an orderly and relatively fast manner. On the solid foundation of the first Five-Year Plan, we, the people of the entire country, have the confidence to build a socialist society in about three Five-Year Plans, so that the people of our country can enjoy a peaceful and happy life and continue to strive towards the lofty goal of a communist society. I sincerely support these two reports and propose that the conference approve and adopt them.

The scale of the first Five-Year Construction Plan is very large, and there will definitely be many difficulties in the work. However, we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we have abundant resources, we have a large population, and we have the sincere help of the Soviet Union in spirit, material, and technology. As long as we work hard, we believe that all difficulties can be overcome. In the work of the first Five-Year Plan, we technical workers have a great responsibility to complete our glorious and arduous tasks.

I am a design worker in a steel plant. During the period of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China had no steel industry. Therefore, although we wanted to do some construction work for the country, it was ultimately an illusion. Only after the liberation of the entire country in the new China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people took power, it became possible to formulate such a great first Five-Year Plan, to carry out large-scale industrial construction, and technical workers had the opportunity to serve the country and the people with what they had learned, and it was possible to improve their technical level in actual work, especially with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, to learn what was previously impossible to learn. I am now able to participate in the design work of large-scale and modern steel plants in the country, feeling extremely honored, and I will definitely study hard and fulfill my glorious duties on my work post.

In the work of the first Five-Year Plan, we steel plant design workers must ensure the following points:

1. To properly and frugally use the country's resources. Our country's resources are abundant, but due to the limitation of exploration capabilities, it is not possible to find enough raw materials needed for industry in a short period of time, resulting in the phenomenon of insufficient raw materials in the process of industrial construction. Therefore, we must cherish our country's resources and not waste a bit. For example, in the manufacture of ordinary refractory bricks, it is not appropriate to use refractory clay with extremely high aluminum content, so that it can be used as a raw material for aluminum smelting, otherwise it is a waste of resources. Again, powdered iron ore must be utilized. In the coking process, the recovery rate of coal washing must be improved, and the production of coke must be balanced with iron smelting to avoid wasting precious coking coal.

2. To accept new things and overcome conservative ideas. Conservative ideas in design can cause a great waste of national resources. In the design work of steel plants, if the advanced indicators of the Soviet Union are not accepted and the design is carried out according to old materials, then in a steel plant with the same output, it may be necessary to double the investment. For example, if the utilization rate of the blast furnace is conservative, then in a steel plant, it may be necessary to build one or two more large blast furnaces, which will increase a lot of investment. Again, a 1,150-millimeter initial rolling mill, according to the American standard, can only roll 100,000 tons of steel ingots per year, but according to the advanced indicators of the Soviet Union, 300,000 tons of steel ingots can be rolled per year, and the investment of the initial rolling mill is very large, and the installation of an additional initial rolling mill will waste a lot of funds. Therefore, we must strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, be sensitive to new things, do not emphasize objective difficulties, and should overcome all difficulties to adopt new advanced indicators.

3. To oppose laxity and work and study hard. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the various enterprises designed by the Soviet Union for us are all based on the latest scientific achievements and advanced indicators of the Soviet Union, and some are the first designs in the Soviet Union. For example, for the design of a certain steel plant in Wuhan, the Soviet government issued an order to rush to complete our design within a limited time. They showed selfless enthusiasm and brotherly international friendship to help us, and we should express our heartfelt thanks. We must learn the designs they did for us and provide design materials on time and strive to provide them ahead of schedule. Their selfless work and hard work to complete our work for us, while we delay the submission of materials, is extremely wrong. Therefore, we design and technical personnel must correct our design ideas, learn Marxism-Leninism, and establish the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people and taking responsibility.

4. To overcome the phenomenon of waste. Waste in design, although not obvious on the surface, will cause great waste if the drawings and design are not careful, especially in large-scale construction units, if a little bit is relaxed, it will waste tens of thousands of yuan or even more. We must understand that the accumulation of national construction funds is not easy, we must be meticulous and careful, and we must not waste a single penny, so that we can be worthy of the country and the people.

5. In the design, we must make full use of and improve old equipment. The technical personnel of the enterprise side and the design side, in order to pursue novelty or to avoid trouble, often advocate abandoning all old equipment and old factory buildings in the enterprise expansion work, and do not think about how to improve it and make full use of it, which will greatly increase the national investment. The reason why the Soviet Union can develop industrial production so rapidly is largely because it continuously improves old factories and improves productivity. Seventy percent of the increase in production tasks in our first Five-Year Plan is to be completed by the existing enterprises. Therefore, the idea of disliking the old and liking the new that exists in some responsible comrades in enterprises should be corrected.

We technical personnel must stand on the front line of industrial construction with the workers, and contribute all our strength to serve the people without reservation, work hard on our work posts, and ensure the timely and ahead-of-schedule completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Dong Biwu (President of the Supreme People's Court)**

After hearing the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I fully agree. I propose that the conference approve the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and the draft of the Law on Military Service, approve the 1954 national budget, the 1955 national budget, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and adopt the principles and basic contents of the comprehensive plan for the prevention of floods and the development of water resources of the Yellow River.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan is a great plan and is a major step in realizing the transitional period's general task stipulated in our country's constitution. The realization of this plan will begin to change the face of our country's national economy, will lay the initial foundation for our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and our country's national defense force to defend peace and democracy will be further strengthened, and the material and cultural lives of our people will have the possibility of further improvement. The realization of this plan will be another great victory for our people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, following the victory of the new democratic revolution, in the march towards socialism. The victory of the people is the defeat of the people's enemies. The greater the victory of the people, the more miserable the defeat of the people's enemies. Therefore, imperialism, the Kuomintang traitor group, the remaining class residues that have been eliminated within the country, and the elements of the class that have to retreat from the historical stage due to resistance to transformation are not willing to accept their defeat, and they are even more unwilling to see the people achieve new victories. They will definitely use all means to sabotage our country's Five-Year Plan. This means that the Five-Year Plan must be and can only be realized in a complex and sharp class struggle. The people's courts are the judicial organs of our state. The people's courts must direct the sharp edge of state law at all counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who endanger state security and sabotage economic construction, and at the same time, solve various civil disputes, defend the people's democratic system, maintain public order, protect public property, and protect the rights and legal interests of citizens. The people's courts and public security and procuratorial organs do a good job in these aspects, which is of great significance in guaranteeing the realization of the Five-Year Plan. The people's courts adjust the internal relations of the people according to law, and through the trial method, educate the people to abide by state discipline, which is also of positive significance for the realization of the Five-Year Plan.

Over the past two years, the Supreme People's Court and local people's courts have done a lot of work under the guidance of serving economic construction. There were more than 120 special trial organizations for economic construction cases in the people's courts of various provinces and cities before the promulgation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts. At present, 11 special railway transportation courts and 2 special water transportation courts have been established nationwide. The Supreme People's Court has also established the Railway and Water Transportation Trial Court. According to incomplete statistics, from January 1954 to March 31, 1955, the people's courts at all levels across the country accepted 255,091 initial trial cases related to economic construction. In protecting factories, mines, basic construction, transportation, and other enterprises, the people's courts and public security and procuratorial organs have forcefully struck at the criminal activities of counter-revolutionaries and corrupt elements, thieves, and handled a part of major responsibility accidents; while trying cases, they conducted propaganda and education on improving revolutionary vigilance, cherishing state property, and abiding by labor discipline for the workers. Some people's courts have reported the problems and loopholes in the work found in the trial of economic construction cases to the relevant competent departments and made suggestions for improving work and preventing crimes. In guaranteeing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the people's courts in various places, especially in cities, generally actively combine with the central work, and focus on striking at tax evaders, those who disrupt processing and ordering, those who disrupt market management, and those who withdraw funds to damage production and other criminals who sabotage national economic construction. In this way, not only the criminal activities of lawless capitalists are struck, but also the patriotic and law-abiding education of general industrial and commercial people is expanded. In guaranteeing agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture, the people's courts at the grassroots level in various places have punished some criminals who disrupt production and mutual aid and cooperation, eliminated the worries of the peasants, improved the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the peasants. At the same time, the people's courts in various places have also actively guaranteed the smooth implementation of flood control and disaster relief and the centralized purchase and sale of grain and other central tasks from the aspect of trial work, and have fought resolutely against thieves, hooligans, and other social scum that disrupt social order. All the work of the people's courts has great significance for the coordination of economic construction.

The people's courts have not done a very satisfactory job in serving economic construction. The direction of serving economic construction for judicial work was established early, but not every judicial worker has a deep understanding of this direction, especially the judicial workers' knowledge of law and economy is generally poor, and the relevant regulations in this aspect are not perfect, and the accumulation of systematic experience in this aspect is still very insufficient. The people's courts have conducted pilot tests in some factories and mines, but in fact, they only touched the surface, and generally, they did not do it thoroughly. In cities, how to fight against saboteurs and in rural areas, how to guarantee the consolidation and development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, we have not conducted in-depth investigations and systematic summaries of experience. These shortcomings and difficulties can only be gradually overcome in future practice.

After the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Organic Law of the People's Courts, the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme People's Court held a judicial seminar for the presidents of provincial and municipal courts and the directors of judicial departments in November 1954 to study the Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts and to discuss how to mobilize and organize judicial personnel nationwide to study and implement the Organic Law of the People's Courts. The situation of this seminar has been reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. After the seminar, the high people's courts and judicial departments in various provinces and municipalities successively held meetings to study and implement the Organic Law of the People's Courts. Over the past half year, the people's courts in various places have made great achievements in studying and implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts. In places where the people's congresses have been held, the presidents of the high people's courts, intermediate people's courts, and basic people's courts have been elected according to the provisions of the Constitution, and some regions have strengthened the organizational structure of the people's courts; the people's courts at all levels have established or are establishing various trial systems; judicial personnel have improved their political awareness and strengthened their legal consciousness through study, initially improved their trial style, and improved the quality of trial work. However, there are still many people's courts that lack the spirit of combining theory with practice in studying and implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts, have not well combined the study with the inspection of their own work and style, and have not well understood the spirit and essence of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, and conservative ideas have not been completely overcome. There are still phenomena of mechanically promoting various trial systems in the study and implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts. In general, the implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts in various places is just beginning and must be further striven for.

To understand and inspect the situation of the people's courts at all levels in studying and implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts, the Ministry of Justice sent personnel to inspect various provinces after the seminar. The Supreme People's Court also sent personnel to Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces to understand and inspect the work of the high people's courts and the courts at lower levels in a focused manner, and found many problems. The Ministry of Justice and the Supreme People's Court held a judicial seminar in May of this year, attended by the presidents of the high people's courts, the directors of the judicial departments, and some of the presidents of the intermediate people's courts, to check the situation of the people's courts at all levels in studying and implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts and to focus on solving the following two problems:

First, the correct understanding of the current political situation. At the beginning of the seminar, the attendees knew that the second session of the First National People's Congress would soon be held to decide on our country's first Five-Year Plan; many cadres thought that our country's first Five-Year Plan was formulated on the basis of the great victories achieved in the restoration period, and the total output value in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan had already been overfulfilled, but they were satisfied with our great achievements in economic construction, and at the same time, they were intoxicated by the victories of the past anti-counter-revolutionary movement and other social reform movements, which fostered a very harmful complacency, and therefore, they lacked the necessary understanding of the fact that our country is in a state of imperialist encirclement, that our country is still a class society, and the complexity and sharpness of the current class struggle in our country, and even forgot about it. They did not understand that although the anti-counter-revolutionary movement was carried out with great fanfare, and in the subsequent period, counter-revolutionaries were continuously struck, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces were becoming fewer and fewer, but in the process of socialist transformation, a new batch of counter-revolutionaries would inevitably emerge, and at the same time, their sabotage activities would become more cunning and vicious. They infiltrated and hid in our state organs, organizations, factories, mines, transportation enterprises, basic construction projects, etc., and used various opportunities to carry out various sabotage activities. If we do not give a resolute strike and suppression to these sabotage activities, our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation will not be able to proceed smoothly, and the victory of the Five-Year Plan will not be guaranteed. At the seminar, everyone, with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, exposed and criticized the blind complacency and underestimation of the enemy of many judicial personnel, and the tendency of heavy punishment and light punishment, weak strikes, and trial work detached from political struggle and isolated cases that arose from this, and everyone decided to take the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, "to enhance vigilance, eliminate all spy elements; prevent deviations, do not wrong a good person," as the guiding principle for the trial work of the people's courts, and give accurate and severe strikes to all counter-revolutionaries and other criminals.

Second, check and criticize some bad trial styles that still exist in the people's courts at present. Its main manifestations are that in the trial of cases, there is a tendency to prejudge, to listen to one side, to be subjective and arbitrary, and to believe in confessions lightly while not paying attention to evidence. This bad trial style hinders the correct conduct of trial work, and even leniently deals with criminals and wrongs innocent people, causing a bad influence among the masses. This is actually a reflection of bourgeois idealism in our trial work. In view of these situations, we proposed some methods to improve the trial style, among which the main ones are: the higher people's courts should not only strengthen the supervision of the trial work of the lower people's courts but also strengthen political and ideological leadership; the personnel of the people's courts must seriously study dialectical materialism and state policies, laws, and regulations; the judges of the people's courts must strictly grasp the principles of proceeding from reality, relying on the masses, investigating and researching, seeking truth from facts, and paying attention to evidence rather than lightly believing in confessions; the people's courts at all levels must conduct trial work under the strict supervision of the people's congresses at all levels.

The Supreme People's Court also organized all personnel participating in the trial work to study the Organic Law of the People's Courts. We followed the provisions of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, established various trial courts, and the trial of cases by each trial court was also conducted according to the trial systems stipulated in the Organic Law of the People's Courts, especially the collegial trial system and the public trial system have long been established in the Supreme People's Court. Regarding the work of the clerks, it has been initially rectified according to the provisions of the Organic Law of the People's Courts regarding the duties of the clerks. Our trial work is carried out under the leadership of the collective and the supervision of the masses, which not only guarantees the accuracy of the judgment but also educates the masses.

In the first quarter of this year, the Supreme People's Court conducted an inspection of the work of handling letters from the people and receiving visits from the people in the past half year. The People's Reception Office of the Supreme People's Court handled 3,825 letters from the people in half a year and received 954 visitors, of which 90% were related to litigation issues, and 60% were appeals against the judgments and rulings of various levels of people's courts. From this, it can be seen that our work of handling letters and receiving visits is an important way to connect with the masses and implement judicial supervision. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this work, and there were phenomena of passive response and accumulation of letters, which the people were not satisfied with. After this inspection and rectification, the work was strengthened in terms of organization and system, and the phenomenon of accumulated letters was basically eliminated. We began to establish the system of the president and the head of the court handling important letters and receiving visitors in rotation, so as to better solve the problems raised by the people and, through this work, implement the supervision of the lower people's courts.

Title: The Supreme People's Court Establishes a Judicial Committee
Author:
Date: 1955-07-08
Page: 1

The establishment of judicial committees in people's courts is stipulated in the Organic Law of the People's Courts. The Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court was established this March. After its establishment, the Judicial Committee first focused on summarizing judicial experiences. We have submitted the actual materials on the trial procedures for criminal cases in fourteen major cities and intermediate-level people's courts, and the actual materials on the trial procedures for civil cases in thirteen major cities and intermediate-level people's courts, for the Judicial Committee to summarize. This is a rather arduous task. The Judicial Committee held four meetings, and the entire work took half a year. At this judicial conference, the experiences were discussed and revised by the attending presidents, and finally approved by the Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court, before being compiled into a summary of the experiences of the people's courts in thirteen and fourteen major cities in handling civil and criminal cases. Each major city's people's court originally had its own set of written or unwritten procedures for handling civil and criminal cases, with rich experiences but very inconsistent. The Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court summarized these experiences by integrating the procedures of the major cities' people's courts for handling civil and criminal cases. For cases handled with different procedures, we made them the same; for the same content expressed with different terms, we made them consistent. We also wanted to slightly improve the procedures of the major cities' people's courts for handling civil and criminal cases, that is, to raise them to meet the requirements of the Organic Law of the People's Courts. Therefore, these two documents are only a partial summary of the experiences of the people's courts' judicial work. After being approved by the Judicial Committee, they have been printed and distributed to the major and intermediate cities' people's courts for reference and trial implementation, and have been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for record. As for the experiences of the provincial high people's courts in handling civil and criminal cases, we plan to summarize them in the second half of this year. The materials on the trial procedures for civil and criminal cases in the intermediate and primary people's courts across the country will not be collected until next year. Summarizing these parts of the experiences will naturally be included in our work plan for next year.

We know that the Supreme People's Court and local people's courts at all levels have many shortcomings and errors in their judicial work. I sincerely hope that the National People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and local people's congresses at all levels will strictly supervise and criticize the judicial work of our people's courts, so that we can eliminate shortcomings, correct errors, and continuously improve our work. Recently, at the third session of the people's congresses in ten districts of Beijing, the representatives seriously reviewed the work reports of the people's courts and put forward serious criticisms. According to incomplete statistics, the representatives of the ten districts put forward 540 opinions on the work of the municipal and district people's courts, which were summarized into 385 opinions, of which 64 were praises, 202 were criticisms, and 119 were suggestions. These criticisms and suggestions are very valuable, urging and inspiring the workers of the people's courts to strive for the successful completion of China's first Five-Year Plan for national economic development.

Vice Chairman Shen Junru's Speech

The central topic of this conference is to decide on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan, to review and approve the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

I fully agree with the draft of the Five-Year Plan and the national budget.

The first Five-Year Plan is a program with decisive significance for the Chinese Communist Party and the government to lead the entire people to struggle for the completion of the general tasks of the transitional period.

This is a program for the realization of socialism.

What is socialism for? It is to make the country prosperous and strong, to make the future happy, and to contribute to world peace.

This is a great cause that changes the direction of our country's history and the face of society. Therefore, it is necessary for all the people of the country, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, to work diligently and strive to ensure the smooth implementation of the Five-Year Plan and the ultimate victory of the great cause of socialism.

I would like to say a few words here about what intellectuals should do and how they should do it.

To turn China, which is backward in culture, science, and technology, into a socialist industrialized China, we must rely on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the joint efforts of all the working people of the country. However, intellectuals should also shoulder a heavy responsibility. We need to cultivate a large number of builders, improve technical levels, and conduct political, theoretical, and scientific and technological education for the people of the country. In short, we need to make culture, science, and technology serve the Five-Year Plan and socialism, which is what intellectuals should do.

Undoubtedly, in the great struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation, intellectuals will be an important fighting force. However, on the other hand, it must be recognized that intellectuals from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois backgrounds all have many shortcomings. Most old intellectuals, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "often have tendencies of subjectivism and individualism, their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often vacillating." Subjectivism and individualism often develop into arrogance, self-satisfaction, and even self-interest, which will inevitably lead to alienation from the masses, alienation from reality, and inability to accept new things, which are incompatible with the cause of socialism. Therefore, intellectuals who want to participate in the great cause of building socialism should first seriously carry out self-education and transformation.

I myself am an intellectual from the old society. Over the years, although I have followed the Chinese Communist Party and received the Party's education, I still have many shortcomings, and my illness is still deep. I often ask myself:

Have I closely followed the Chinese Communist Party?

Do I have any feelings of arrogance and self-satisfaction?

Can I serve the people wholeheartedly and serve socialism wholeheartedly?

I believe that we intellectuals must constantly examine ourselves, strictly demand of ourselves, and seriously study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong. In revolutionary practice, we must temper ourselves and further educate the broad masses of the people, so that we can transform ourselves into new people of the new society and make contributions to the great cause of socialism.

Representative comrades! I fully believe that through the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, our revolutionary cause will definitely be successful. However, in the process of advancing, we must overcome all difficulties and obstacles. Domestic and foreign enemies will not be willing to fail and will definitely use all means to sabotage our socialist construction. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiracy is a very profound lesson for us. We must always be vigilant and never allow counter-revolutionary elements to hide within the ranks of intellectuals.

Representative comrades! I propose to the conference to adopt the draft of the first Five-Year Plan and approve the national budget. Let us all unite and, with the first Five-Year Plan as the goal and program, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and frugality, wholeheartedly and diligently, and strive for the completion of the great cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation!

Minister Zhang Zhirou's Speech

I fully agree with the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on this Five-Year Plan. I also fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources. I propose that the conference adopt the Five-Year Plan, approve the national budget, and adopt these reports.

The first Five-Year Plan is a program with decisive significance for the completion of the general tasks of the transitional period. We educators should actively support it and stand at our posts, working diligently and conscientiously, overcoming various difficulties, and ensuring the implementation of the educational construction plan in the Five-Year Plan.

I would like to say a few words about several issues in general education.

The Five-Year Plan has set targets for the development of general education, which are based on the needs of the country's overall economic construction and the current conditions of the country's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and are practical. However, some people often raise the question: Why doesn't the government spend more money and open more middle schools and primary schools to allow more children to go to school or study?

We say that the government is very concerned about the development of the cause of national education. The education funds allocated by the state are not small but considerable. The funds for general education and teacher education account for 5.54% of the total expenditure of the Five-Year Plan. Every year, education funds account for more than half of the total funds for culture, education, and health. The "education expenditure" item in the 1955 budget is 28 times higher than the highest budget year for education expenditure during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government (1946). The social and cultural expenditure budget of the United States for the 1952-1953 fiscal year accounted for only 3.6% of the total budget, while China's social and cultural expenditure budget for 1953 accounted for 14.9% of the total budget expenditure. If education funds are to be increased, it is not only impossible but also inappropriate. Why? Because socialist industrialization is the central task of our country in the transitional period, and the central link of socialist industrialization is to first develop heavy industry. This is the correct and unshakable policy for socialist construction. If education funds are increased, it will inevitably reduce investment in industrial construction, which will delay the progress of socialist industrialization. This is contrary to the general tasks of the transitional period and is therefore not allowed. Economic construction is the foundation of national construction, and industrial construction is the foundation of the foundation. Cultural and educational undertakings should be carried out on the basis of the development of production and can only be carried out on the basis of the development of production. If the investment in economic construction is reduced to develop cultural and educational undertakings, it will be a case of putting the cart before the horse. In the Soviet Union, after the October Revolution, for a considerable period of time, all expenditures were saved, including the expenditure of education funds, and all efforts were concentrated on first carrying out socialist industrialization. Our country's industrial foundation is even worse than that of the Soviet Union at that time, so we should do the same. Some people support the socialist industrialization of the state with their mouths, but when their children cannot go to school, they blame the government for not opening more schools, which is obviously wrong. In fact, since the founding of New China, the development of our general education has been very great. In 1954, the number of middle school students reached more than 3.58 million, and the number of primary school students reached more than 51.19 million. Compared with the early days of liberation (1949), the number of middle school students increased by nearly 2.5 times, and the number of primary school students increased by more than 1.5 times. Compared with 1952, the number of middle school students increased by 44%, and the number of primary school students increased slightly after the rectification. By 1957, the number of middle school students will reach 4,700,700, and the number of primary school students will reach 60,230,000, which is more than 70% of the school-age children in the country. Of course, due to the improvement of people's lives, this still cannot fully meet the cultural needs of the people. However, to ensure the development of heavy industry, education funds cannot and should not be increased. I think this is clear to everyone and does not need to be said more. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. The other aspect is the problem of teachers. The shortage of teachers in quantity and quality is a very serious problem. Among the current middle school teachers in the country, about half do not meet the graduation level of a normal college, and among the primary school teachers, nearly half do not meet the graduation level of a junior normal school. The impact of this situation is obvious. To cultivate new teachers and improve the existing teachers, it will take a considerable amount of time and cannot be done in a short period. In addition, there are difficulties with school buildings and equipment. Due to the above situations, the state can only adopt the policy of developing middle and primary schools in a planned, step-by-step, and conditional manner.

Of course, we still want to do our best within the possible range to meet the cultural needs of the masses, mainly by implementing the spirit of simplification and thrift, making full use of potential, and opening as many schools as possible and enrolling as many students as possible. On the one hand, we should make full use of the potential of schools, gradually promote the two-shift system, and fully utilize the existing human and material resources of schools; establish a reasonable school network to ensure that children can go to school nearby, reduce boarding students, and enable schools to enroll more students. On the other hand, we should make full use of the potential of the masses, mobilize the people to actively open schools according to the spirit of the first Five-Year Plan and the government's policy of encouraging the people to open schools and allowing private schools to open, and assist the state in developing the cause of national education to meet their own cultural needs. With the rapid development of the agricultural production cooperative movement, farmers' demand for culture is becoming more and more urgent, and they have the conditions to open primary schools and have the tradition of opening schools. Therefore, we should actively support and develop people's primary schools according to the principles of need and voluntarism. Some people have the idea of "being afraid of trouble," "being afraid of taking on the burden," "being afraid of not being regular," and "being afraid of not being able to do it well" about people's primary schools. This is a detached and unrealistic idea and is wrong. The actual difficulty in developing people's primary schools at present is that in economically developed areas, there are generally already public primary schools, while in areas without public primary schools, they are precisely economically underdeveloped areas. Some people see this situation and say that the past practice was unreasonable. We believe that in the case of limited manpower and financial resources of the state, it is reasonable to first open schools in areas with a high population density and relatively developed economy. In the future, for areas that have the conditions to open schools but already have public schools, we should actively develop people's primary schools to meet the needs of children's enrollment; in economically underdeveloped areas, in addition to developing public primary schools in a planned and step-by-step manner, we can also appropriately develop people's primary schools. In areas with very few schools, such as ethnic minority areas, we should appropriately develop public primary schools.

While actively and steadily developing general education, we must pay attention to improving the quality of education. In the past, our education administrative departments focused on the development of the number of schools and neglected the improvement of the quality of education, which is not in line with the requirements of national construction for education work. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in the government work report at the first session of the First National People's Congress: "The development of primary and secondary education has been very great, and in the future, we should focus on improving the quality." In the past year, education administrative departments at all levels and primary and secondary schools have paid attention to the work of improving the quality of education, clearly defined the need to run schools and teach students according to the principle of comprehensive development, and improve the quality of education. To improve the quality of education, we must improve the quality of teachers and school leaders, and improve the quality of textbooks. Regarding the former, we have decided to adopt various methods of on-the-job study and off-the-job training to gradually improve the political level and cultural and professional level of school leaders and teachers, and strive to train all school leaders and general education administrative cadres once in the next three to five years, and plan to raise the level of primary school teachers who do not meet the graduation level of a normal school to the level of a normal school graduate, and the level of middle school teachers who do not meet the graduation level of a normal college to the level of a normal college graduate in the second Five-Year Plan period. Regarding the latter, the Ministry of Education decided to actively organize forces in the next three years to compile a relatively complete set of teaching outlines and textbooks for primary and secondary schools and normal schools, and compile some teaching guidance books.

Here, we must point out that in the work of improving the quality of education, some regions and some schools have set too high and too urgent requirements for improving the quality of students' learning, and adopted some impractical methods, resulting in the long-existing phenomenon of students' heavy burden becoming more serious, and students' health being greatly affected. This situation has attracted widespread attention and concern in society. The Ministry of Education is responsible for this, and we should seriously review and continue to take effective measures to correct it.

The fundamental way to reduce students' burden is to improve textbooks and improve the level of teachers and school leaders. But this is not a problem that can be completely solved in a short time, and we must also adopt other timely and effective measures. In the past half year, various regions and schools have put the reduction of students' burden on the agenda of work, and initially come up with some improvement methods. At present, the phenomenon of students' heavy burden has begun to change somewhat, but this is still a problem that cannot be ignored. The Ministry of Education has compiled the experiences of various places and recently issued the "Instructions on Reducing the Heavy Burden of Primary and Secondary School Students." The implementation and realization of this instruction still hope to be supervised and promoted by all parties.

Now it is summer vacation. In the past two years, during the summer vacation, due to the problem of enrollment and production labor of primary and secondary school graduates, a tense atmosphere appeared in society. The situation this year is also quite serious. We must first explain to these young students and their parents that the task of ordinary schools is to cultivate conscious and active builders of socialist society, and in the future for a considerable period of time, the basic policy of the state for junior high school and primary school graduates, in addition to enrolling a small number of people, is mainly to mobilize and organize a part of people to engage in industrial production and the majority to engage in agricultural production, and actively participate in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative movement. However, the ideological obstacles to implementing this policy are still very serious. On the one hand, it is because our propaganda and explanation work is not deep enough, and this correct policy has not been understood and accepted by everyone. Some people still do not understand why junior high school and primary school graduates cannot all go to school and why they should be mobilized to engage in production labor. Therefore, they are more or less dissatisfied with the government's inability to open more schools. I think for these people, if we explain to them well, they will actively support the state's basic policy for junior high school and primary school graduates. On the other hand, it is because the influence of the old society's contempt for labor by the exploiting class is very deep. In the past, schools did not do enough in labor education, so many junior high school and primary school graduates only want to go to school, become cadres, become experts, and do not want to engage in production labor, especially agricultural production labor. They think that going back to the countryside to work is "too hard," "too dirty," "too shameful," and "has no future." The reason why young students have the idea of "all other occupations are inferior, only studying is superior" and "learning well leads to officialdom" and the idea of looking down on manual labor and laboring people is due to the infiltration of the ideology of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie on the younger generation. We must criticize this harmful idea and use socialist ideology to educate young people, and establish a social atmosphere and custom of loving labor and respecting laboring people. We hope that students from rural areas, if they cannot be admitted to school, should go back to the countryside to engage in agricultural production and actively participate in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative movement; for students from urban areas who cannot go to school, we hope that their parents can do their best to help their children find jobs. We also hope that graduates who cannot go to school and cannot participate in production or work for the time being will actively participate in self-study groups, continue to study culture and production knowledge, and prepare to participate in production labor in the future. The government is very concerned about the enrollment and employment of these students and will do its best to help solve the problem. However, some students and parents have the idea of relying solely on the government and hoping that the government will take care of everything, which is wrong, unrealistic, and impossible.

The future of New China is bright and boundless, and the future of the younger generation is also boundless. "Everything for socialism." We welcome young comrades to go to the glorious posts of various constructions of the motherland, and we also hope that their parents and all sectors of society will help them go to these posts.

Representative Ye Shengtao's Speech

At the beginning of this conference, we listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first Five-Year Plan. In the representative group, most of the time was spent reading and discussing the draft of the first Five-Year Plan. This plan is indeed comprehensive and well-thought-out, with a very appropriate structure and a very clear explanation, making it easy for ordinary people to understand if they are willing to think. We are not people who yearn for an imaginary socialism, but people who want to realize a practical socialism based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The purpose of this Five-Year Plan is, in a word, to lay a solid material foundation for the realization of socialism. In the past, we learned some principles about laying a material foundation for the development of the national economy, such as the need to prioritize the development of heavy industry, the need to maintain an appropriate proportion between industry and agriculture, the need to maintain an appropriate proportion between heavy industry and light industry, and the need to match the construction plan with the accumulation of funds, etc. Now, these principles have been concretized in this plan. In other words, these principles have been concretely reflected in the allocation of investment, production indicators, and the coordination of various tasks in this plan. This makes everyone understand that, based on the specific situation of our country, and with reference to the experience of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of our country should be compiled in this way, and must be compiled in this way, and only in this way can theory and practice be combined. Everyone has received the most profound and specific education in Marxism-Leninism from here. Having received such an education, one's thinking method will definitely be improved, and it will definitely have an impact on various kinds of work. Therefore, I first express my sincere gratitude to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for drafting and submitting this plan. I, like many representative comrades, propose that the conference adopt this plan.

After this plan is adopted, we must study it carefully and seriously. Although we have some understanding now, it is only preliminary and still far from enough. Such a vast and detailed thing, if one only skims through it, cannot understand it thoroughly, but we must understand it thoroughly. I want to say two points.

An enterprise, a work unit, in the entire plan, only undertakes a task, big or small, wide or narrow. However, no matter what task, it is connected with the entire plan. Using a commonly used analogy, the entire plan is like a machine, and various industries and fields are like gears and screws. To make the machine run smoothly and fully exert its efficiency, not a single gear or screw can be loose. The more thoroughly we understand the Five-Year Plan, the more we can understand the relationship of coordination and connection between various kinds of work, just like this analogy. This understanding is not only reflected in understanding, speaking out, and writing down, but will also be reflected in practice, because at that time there will be a conscious spirit guiding us, and we must work harder. Since we know that if we do not do well in our own post, not only our own post will be affected, but a series of other work will also be affected, who will still be careless and casual about their own post? Since we know that a unit or even an individual's occasional relaxation is not a "small matter," just like a unit or even an individual's occasional waste is not a "small matter," from the overall perspective, it is a very harmful "big matter," who will still take this very harmful "big matter" on themselves? This conscious spirit is a necessary guarantee for the completion and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan.

This means that to work harder, we must understand the Five-Year Plan thoroughly.

On the one hand, we work harder, on the other hand, we must always be vigilant, because the enemies of the people do not like us to complete the Five-Year Plan and will send some saboteurs to sabotage our Five-Year Plan. Recently, I saw the "Economic Translation Series" published this month, which contains Molotov's "We Must Learn from the Sabotage and Espionage of the Trotskyite Fascist Dogs." The article has not been completed yet, but from the published part, it can be seen that saboteurs specially target key aspects. For example, if you set standards for various constructions, only by following the standards can production be smooth, they will try their best to make it not meet the standards. Again, if you want one production to coordinate with another production, only by coordinating can the two have a complementary effect, they will try their best to make the two productions decouple. Now we must be vigilant, and the methods are not just one or two, I think that understanding the Five-Year Plan thoroughly should be one of them. We understand the Five-Year Plan thoroughly, and from a broad perspective or a narrow perspective, we can definitely recognize where the key aspects are. The key aspects are clear, which is called grasping the main points and understanding the general aspects. In this way, before the sabotage activities are carried out, as long as the saboteurs are secretly trying to make the first move, or as long as they show some "signs" in their words and expressions, we will be alert to see it.

This means that to be vigilant, we must also understand the Five-Year Plan thoroughly.

Representative Shu Tong's Speech

I fully agree with and support the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a program with decisive significance for the completion of the general tasks of the transitional period. It is led by the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to lead the people of the country to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist country. Its complete implementation will lay a solid material foundation for happiness for us and our descendants. This is in line with the wishes of the people of the country, including the broad masses of workers and people in Shanghai.

The first Five-Year Plan stipulates that about 70% of the increase in industrial total output value in five years should be completed by existing enterprises. Shanghai is one of the important industrial bases of our country, so Shanghai workers are responsible for the glorious task of implementing the Five-Year Plan. We must fully tap the potential of existing enterprises to complete the tasks of increasing production, practicing thrift, and improving labor productivity; we must continuously improve our technical level to complete the task of trial production and production of a large number of new products; and we must strive to cultivate technical workers and cadres and send them to the interior to support the construction of the motherland.

In the past two and a half years, Shanghai workers have completed and overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the state. In 1953, we not only guaranteed the completion of the first-year plan of the Five-Year Plan but also increased production and saved a billion yuan for the state. In 1954, the labor productivity of the state-owned, cooperative, and joint-venture industries in the city increased by more than 15% compared with 1953; the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai completed the annual production value plan by 107.08% in 1954. Under the encouragement of workers across the country and the people of the country, Shanghai workers have full confidence to guarantee the completion and strive for the over-fulfillment of the glorious tasks assigned to us in the first Five-Year Plan.

The task of Shanghai workers in the future is to carry out the spirit of diligence, overcoming difficulties, increasing production, and practicing thrift, to carry out labor competitions more widely and deeply, to give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity, to continuously improve technology, improve technology, learn and master new technologies, actively support the reasonable suggestions of the broad masses of workers, and promote advanced experiences, especially the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, to ensure the successful completion of the tasks of the last three years of the first Five-Year Plan.

The workers of state-owned and joint-venture factories in Shanghai should strive to complete the variety plan and the trial production plan of new products in the national plan. In the past two and a half years, we have successfully trial-produced many new products, such as the complete set of equipment for a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine and a 100-ton crane, and some new types of machine tools. However, last year we did not complete the product variety plan, mainly because we lacked experience, the drawings were not designed correctly, the raw materials did not meet the technical standards, and the workers were not skilled. Therefore, we must strengthen a series of work in this regard, pay attention to summarizing the experience of every bit of work, and learn from the advanced experience of other places, overcome the weak links in the trial production of new products, and guarantee the production of more, better, and cheaper new machines and other new products that fully meet the national standards for the state, to meet the needs of new, expanded, and reconstructed factories and mines.

To increase production for the state, accumulate funds, and better meet the needs of people's lives, we must use raw materials economically, so that the same amount of raw materials can produce more industrial products. In public and private cotton textile mills, although the wisdom of the workers has been fully utilized, and the advanced experience of saving cotton has been promoted, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn has been reduced to 386.1 market jin, which is nearly 7 market jin less than the planned amount; but some textile mills still do not pay enough attention to saving raw cotton. We will continue to work hard in the future, and promote the advanced experience of enterprises throughout the city to continue to practice thrift in raw cotton on the basis of ensuring quality. In the machinery industry, many products are of poor quality and scrapped, and the phenomenon of waste of raw materials and casual discarding is still very serious. Some workers said with pain: "There is gold everywhere." Therefore, we must practice comprehensive thrift and eliminate waste from all aspects.

In the construction of socialist industrialization, the lack of scientific and technological talents is a serious problem. To meet the needs of scientific and technological talents in national construction, Shanghai workers should cultivate, train, and send a large number of technical personnel or skilled workers to the places where the state needs them. This is a glorious responsibility. Shanghai is an older industrial base, and there are relatively more technical personnel and skilled workers needed for various constructions, and we should make full use of and give full play to this condition; technical personnel and masters should quickly and well teach their scientific knowledge and technology to new workers, and masters should be responsible for "guaranteeing teaching and learning," and bring up good apprentices; at the same time, we should organize and educate new workers to humbly learn culture and technology, and continuously improve socialist awareness. In the past four years, Shanghai has organized more than 70,000 technical workers, technical personnel, and economic working cadres to participate in key constructions in the interior, and 5,500 technical workers have participated in key constructions from the second half of 1954 to March of this year. They left their families happily, changed their original living habits, and generally speaking, it is good; but there are also a few people who, because they are not used to life, do not work hard, some are arrogant and self-satisfied, and cause trouble with benefits and treatment, and do not actively get along well with local workers, which shows that there are still many shortcomings in our work. In the future, to mobilize more workers to participate in key constructions, we must constantly strengthen ideological education for the broad masses of workers to overcome difficulties and hardships, so that they are always ready to listen to the dispatch of the state and actively participate in the posts needed to support key constructions.

Shanghai is also a city with a concentration of capitalist enterprises. To cooperate with the state's work of socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises, the workers and trade union organizations in Shanghai's capitalist enterprises should also supervise and assist capitalists in accepting transformation, and while transforming enterprises, transform themselves. On the one hand, they should supervise them to strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the state, and prevent various illegal activities; they should oppose capitalists from corrupting workers and splitting the unity of workers, or excessively exploiting, such as the "pulling away cadres, corrupting trade union cadres, and isolating the branch secretary" carried out by some capitalists, and the "stirring up trouble between the Party, administration, and trade union organizations." Such illegal behaviors must be given the punishment they deserve. On the other hand, they should promote capitalists to actively improve production management work, reform various unreasonable systems, and give full play to the potential of private enterprises. As for the capitalists themselves, those who actively participate in production practice, honestly operate enterprises according to state decrees, and are willing to accept transformation, our trade union organizations should also actively help them transform and encourage their progress.

The workers in private enterprises should also practice thrift and do a good job in production. On the one hand, they have the responsibility to actively guarantee the completion of state processing orders in terms of quality, quantity, and time; on the other hand, they also have the responsibility to strengthen supervision and assist the government in preventing illegal capitalists from shoddy work, seeking excessive profits, and increasing labor costs and other illegal behaviors.

With the progress of China's socialist industrialization construction, class struggle will inevitably become more intense. The recent exposure of the two major counter-revolutionary cases of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng proves that the enemy will not hesitate to use all kinds of conspiracies to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, and even hide in our Party for a long time to sabotage our revolutionary cause. We must learn from the two cases of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, always be vigilant, purify our ranks, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

The implementation of the Five-Year Plan is a arduous struggle. The trade union organizations at all levels in Shanghai should further improve their leadership style, strengthen their connection with the masses, mobilize the broad masses of workers, and with the attitude of masters of the state, work with the people of the country to implement China's first Five-Year Plan.

Representative Jin Shuliang's Speech

I fully agree with the draft of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first Five-Year Plan. I also fully agree with the 1954 national budget, the 1955 national budget, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the national budget. I also fully agree with Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

I believe that the draft of the first Five-Year Plan is the most perfect plan that can be achieved at present. The reasons are as follows: First, the first Five-Year Plan is fully in line with the spirit of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China; it correctly reflects the general line of the Party during the transitional period and the general tasks of the Chinese people; it appropriately plans the scale of the socialist industrialization of the state; and it appropriately arranges the steps for the implementation of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, ensuring the steady growth of socialist economic power. Second, the first Five-Year Plan meets the requirements of rapid economic development and is also feasible. The high speed is reflected in the development of industry, especially heavy industry. The total industrial output value will increase by nearly one fold in five years, and the output value of steel will increase by more than two folds. No capitalist country can develop its industry at such a high speed. The reason why it is feasible is that it has made correct estimates of objective conditions such as funds, resources, and technical strength. The individual and secondary resource conditions in the plan are also gradually clarified and mastered in the process of construction, which fully shows the advanced nature of the plan. Third, the first Five-Year Plan is centered on the development of heavy industry, but at the same time, it comprehensively and appropriately considers the development of light industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and other aspects. To ensure the continuous high-speed development of the national economy, it is necessary to concentrate forces on the development of heavy industry. To ensure the balanced development of the national economy, it is also necessary to appropriately consider the development of various economic sectors.

Based on the above reasons, I believe that the draft of the first Five-Year Plan is the most perfect plan formulated based on the needs of the people of the country and the appropriate estimation of all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

The successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan will change the face of the national economy, especially the face of industry. The people of the country and the people of the world who love peace will be delighted and inspired. I, as a person who has worked in the steel industry, am more accustomed to observing the overall situation of industry from the perspective of the steel industry, so I have a special feeling for the first Five-Year Plan and cannot hide my inner joy and excitement.

A prosperous and strong China is in sight, and the numbers in front of us are all shining with brilliant light. The brighter the future, the more easily we can recall the darkness and pain of the past.

In the old China, I once saw, and I once practiced in the Hanyang Steel Plant, which was tightly controlled by Japanese imperialism through loans and supervision of finances, making it unable to produce steel for a long time and only able to mine iron to be used by Japanese imperialism. I also saw the Hanyang Iron Works, which had an attached iron smelting plant, could not survive in the chaos of warlords, and finally was taken over by Japanese imperialism through mortgage loans, and all its machinery and equipment were dismantled and taken away.

The construction of the Hanyang Steel Plant and the construction of Japan's first large steel plant, the Yawata Iron and Steel Works, were in the same period, but the result was that the Hanyang Steel Plant, after Japan developed into imperialism, suffered its oppression and plunder. This change in the facts, of course, has various reasons in politics, economy, and national defense, but it proves one thing, that is: at the time of the failure of the Hanyang Steel Plant, our country's industrialization, if it wanted to take the old road of capitalism, had long been a dead end. That is to say, after that time, our country's industrialization had only one road to socialism.

Chairman Mao said in "On the Coalition Government": "Without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry," pointing out the essence of this problem.

The first Five-Year Plan is not easily obtained. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have gone through a long period of bloody struggle to have today's China and today's first Five-Year Plan.

Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, especially the help of the Soviet Union. The 156 projects designed and helped by the Soviet Union are the core facilities of the first Five-Year Plan. In the cultivation of construction talents, the Soviet Union has also given us tremendous help.

As a staff member of a higher industrial school, I deeply feel the glory and arduousness of the task of cultivating construction talents.

Northeast Institute of Technology is one of the 42 higher industrial schools in the country. In the past five years, it has trained 3,441 technical cadres for the state. Teachers have all participated in the study of the Marxism-Leninism evening university in the city, and their theoretical level has gradually improved, and bourgeois ideology has been criticized. They are more and more eager to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. At the same time, due to the promotion of teaching reform, the quality of teaching, although still far from meeting the requirements of the objective situation, has improved year by year. The situation of overloading in teaching, after being pointed out by the Ministry of Higher Education, has taken active measures and has been initially corrected, but the health of students is still a problem that we must pay close attention to in the future.

The location of the Northeast Institute of Technology, Shenyang, is an industrial city, and it is also very close to Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun. It has convenient conditions for contacting production plants and mines. To further improve the quality of teaching and facilitate scientific research, the Northeast Institute of Technology has signed cooperation agreements with 40 plants and mines, including Anshan Steel, and has initially carried out scientific research work, held a scientific seminar, and read 52 papers.

Our work is still far behind the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, especially my personal knowledge and experience are far from enough. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Be honest, diligent, and hardworking, mutually encourage and help each other, and strictly avoid any boasting and arrogance," and comprehensively and systematically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promote teaching reform, and improve the quality of teaching. We will definitely, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, overcome all difficulties, overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work, and strive for the successful implementation of the first Five-Year Plan!

Speech by Madame He Xiangning, Chairperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission

I sincerely support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the treatment of the Yellow River's water disasters and the development of the Yellow River's water resources.

The first Five-Year Plan fully reflects the general desire and common aspiration of the people of our country to build socialism, and is a grand, fast-paced, magnificent, and feasible plan. Through the implementation of this plan, our country will be able to lay the initial foundation for socialist industrialization, and the material and cultural lives of the people will gradually improve and rise. For this great and correct plan and the other three reports, we should resolutely carry them out.

It must be pointed out that with the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the national economy of our country will develop greatly, the industrial power will lay a solid foundation, and the national defense power will be further strengthened. This will make it more difficult for the war-mongering clique of American imperialism to carry out its aggression in Asia, and the peace of Asia and the world will be more secure. Therefore, American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, will certainly be very afraid of and hate the construction of our Five-Year Plan, and will certainly send spies and saboteurs to carry out various counter-revolutionary evil activities against us. The recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the counter-revolutionary crimes of Pan Hannian is a testament to this. To complete the Five-Year Plan, we must resolutely and mercilessly suppress and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and severely punish the counter-revolutionary ringleaders who are extremely evil according to law. This is something that no one can doubt.

Overseas Chinese in general, due to the oppression and persecution of imperialism, are in a difficult situation. The traitorous activities of the Chiang clique have increased the suffering of the overseas Chinese. The achievements of the motherland's construction, diplomatic victories, and the great strengthening of national defense power have all greatly encouraged the overseas Chinese. The first Five-Year Plan of the motherland will quickly lead the motherland to greater prosperity and strength, which is completely in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of the overseas Chinese and meets their eager aspirations for the motherland.

To build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist country, we must strive to safeguard peace and struggle for lasting peace. The peaceful foreign policy of our government clearly expresses the will of the Chinese people to love peace. Our overseas Chinese policy has always followed this basic policy of peaceful diplomacy, which is in line with the policy of establishing and promoting friendly relations between our country and the countries where the overseas Chinese reside. On April 22 of this year, our government and the government of the Republic of Indonesia, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and non-interference in internal affairs, signed a treaty on the settlement of dual nationality issues on the basis of friendship, cooperation, and mutual understanding. In June, they also exchanged notes on the treaty. The treaty and the notes fully reflect our country's sincere wish to solve the complex issue of dual nationality with the Republic of Indonesia on the basis of friendship and cooperation through consultation, to promote the friendly relations between the two countries, and concretely reflect our country's consistent policy of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese and not interfering in the internal affairs of others. This issue has not only met the requirements and vital interests of the overseas Chinese and has been widely welcomed and enthusiastically supported by the overseas Chinese, but is also an important sign of the further development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. This is a good example of solving complex international problems through friendly consultations. The settlement of this issue has strongly struck at the conspiracy of imperialism to sow discord and create rumors over the issue of the nationality of the overseas Chinese, and is an important contribution to improving the relations between our country and the countries of Southeast Asia and promoting the peace of Asia and the world.

The overseas Chinese's enthusiastic support for the motherland is particularly evident during Premier Zhou's visit to Burma and Indonesia. Under the encouragement of the motherland's increasingly solid and prosperous construction, the mutual aid and cultural welfare undertakings of the overseas Chinese have further developed in the past year, and their patriotic sentiments have been further enhanced, and their unity has been further expanded. The friendship between the overseas Chinese and the people of the countries where they reside has also been further enhanced. However, these are still not enough, and we should further strengthen the unity of the overseas Chinese themselves, do a good job in the welfare work of the overseas Chinese themselves, and make more efforts to smash the conspiracy of the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek to harm the overseas Chinese.

In recent years, domestic overseas Chinese work, under the close connection with the central tasks of the government in various periods, has taken into account the special circumstances of the overseas Chinese and their relatives, and solved some practical problems of the overseas Chinese and their relatives, thus achieving the goal of uniting the broad overseas Chinese, and making the overseas Chinese and their relatives continuously improve their patriotic enthusiasm and actively participate in the socialist construction of the country. One of the important tasks of the domestic overseas Chinese work in the past year is to implement the policy of protecting remittances. The State Council issued the "Order on the Implementation of the Policy of Protecting Remittances" in February this year, which clearly stipulates that the state's protection of remittances is not only a current policy but also a long-term policy, and no one is allowed to infringe upon remittances and interfere with the freedom of the relatives of the overseas Chinese to use remittances. Violators should be dealt with according to law. Based on this order, the administrative organs of the main areas where the relatives of the overseas Chinese reside have all taken specific measures to implement the remittance policy, thus further strengthening the connection between the overseas Chinese and the motherland, and the remittances of the whole country have gradually increased. However, the current situation of implementing the remittance policy in various places is not balanced, and the policy is repeatedly explained to the grassroots cadres and the masses, which is still insufficient. I hope that in the future, the governments at all levels in the areas where the relatives of the overseas Chinese reside will continue to pay attention to the implementation of this policy when carrying out various central tasks, and the overseas Chinese work departments at all levels should also take this as the center, and combine it with the various work of the state to implement the overseas Chinese policy. When explaining the policy to the cadres at all levels, they must make them correctly understand that the relatives of the overseas Chinese rely on remittances for life is a historical result, and the main labor force of most overseas Chinese families is abroad, while the relatives left in the country are weak in labor force, and the overseas Chinese areas originally have little land and many people, so for a considerable period of time, remittances will still be an indispensable source of life for the relatives of the overseas Chinese. Therefore, any discrimination against the relatives of the overseas Chinese relying on remittances for life is neglecting the vital interests of nearly ten million people. At the same time, for the long-term interests of the overseas Chinese and their relatives, in addition to protecting remittances, we should also take into account the characteristics of the relatives of the overseas Chinese, strengthen their socialist ideological education, and strictly adhere to the principle of voluntarism, gradually guide the relatives of the overseas Chinese to participate in the various production work of the socialist construction of the country, such as participating in agricultural production, developing wasteland, and participating in handicraft and sideline production, and gradually guide them to join production cooperatives and credit cooperatives. This is beneficial to the country and the broad overseas Chinese and their relatives.

Under the great call of the Five-Year Plan, the overseas Chinese will actively invest in the socialist construction of the country. According to the special situation of the overseas Chinese abroad, Guangdong and Fujian have formulated overseas Chinese investment methods and strengthened specific guidance work to guide them to invest in local industry and agriculture and animal husbandry production, which is of positive significance. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will strengthen the guidance of this work in the future, and also hope that the relevant departments and relevant parties will support and guide the overseas Chinese affairs agencies, and work together with the overseas Chinese affairs agencies to promote this work, so as to fully give play to the patriotic spirit of the overseas Chinese and increase the construction funds of the country.

To ensure the needs of people's lives and national construction, to eliminate grain speculation, to stabilize prices, and to further consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is an important measure to implement the general line of the transitional period. The facts since the implementation of unified purchase and sale have proven that this policy is enthusiastically supported by the people of the country.

Since April of this year, some overseas Chinese and their relatives have reflected that their rations are not enough. According to the understanding of the overseas Chinese representatives who went to the countryside this time, the winter of last year, some areas in Guangdong and Fujian suffered from frost disasters, and the production of coarse grains failed. This spring, they were also threatened by drought, and in the process of unified sale, there were phenomena of first relaxing and then tightening, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission did not timely propose measures to take care of the necessary needs of the relatives of the overseas Chinese in various places according to the characteristics of the relatives of the overseas Chinese relying on remittances, having little land, and having little coarse grains, resulting in a temporary shortage of grain in some overseas Chinese areas. However, the central and local governments immediately took emergency measures to correct and remedy the situation, and now the situation has improved. In view of the fact that unified purchase and sale is an indispensable link in socialist construction, we should strengthen propaganda and education work among the overseas Chinese and their relatives in the future, so that they truly understand and firmly support the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and always be vigilant to prevent the enemy's sabotage and rumors. I hope that the local state organs will pay attention to the supervision of cadres doing a good job of "three definitions" and give appropriate consideration to the grain for weddings, funerals, and celebrations of the relatives of the overseas Chinese in the spirit of thrift, which is still necessary.

In the future, our work will, on the one hand, follow the peaceful foreign policy of our country, implement the treaty between our country and Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality, unite the overseas Chinese, help each other, continue to promote friendly relations with the people of the countries where they reside, strengthen the struggle against the traitorous activities of the Chiang clique to harm the overseas Chinese, and unite the broad overseas Chinese to love the motherland. On the other hand, we will continue to implement the State Council's policy of protecting remittances, and gradually and patiently guide the relatives of the overseas Chinese and the returned overseas Chinese to participate in agricultural, animal husbandry, and sideline production, do a good job in guiding the overseas Chinese to invest in the socialist construction, and gradually solve the employment of the returned overseas Chinese and the study of overseas Chinese students who have returned to the country.

Representatives, the overseas Chinese love the motherland. The overseas Chinese, because of their different situations, cannot participate in the socialist construction with the people of the motherland, and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek cheats them, and the reactionary clique of imperialism hates and excludes them. Because they are in such a complex situation, and the various measures of the motherland are closely related to them, this makes the overseas Chinese work more complicated and involves many aspects. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the representatives and the relevant departments will give us more help and guidance, especially the local people's committees in the areas where the relatives of the overseas Chinese reside, and I hope that they will strengthen the leadership of the overseas Chinese work, so that the state's overseas Chinese policy can be truly grasped by the broad cadres and the masses, which is very necessary for uniting the broad overseas Chinese and their relatives to actively participate in the socialist construction of the country.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    赖若愚代表的发言
    我对于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春同志“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，对于李先念同志“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”和邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”完全同意。
    第一个五年计划是把我国建设成为一个社会主义工业国的重大步骤，国家年度预算是胜利地实现国家建设计划的物质保证，而把我国建设成为一个社会主义工业国，正是工人阶级和全国人民的最大愿望。
    李富春同志的报告在报纸上公布以后，全国各个地区各个产业的职工都在认真地学习，并热烈地表示了为实现这个计划而奋斗的意愿和决心。很显然，这个计划给全国劳动人民指出了国民经济高涨的光明远景，因而鼓舞着全国的职工群众，并且指导着全国的职工群众，向着这个光明的远景前进。
    胜利地实现第一个五年建设计划，要依靠全国人民的努力，特别是依靠工人阶级的努力。广大职工群众对于建设社会主义的热情和创造精神，是实现五年计划的最重要的保证。而劳动竞赛则是职工群众劳动热情和创造精神的集中表现，也是社会主义建设的基本方法。
    五年计划草案中指出：“国营工业一九五七年比一九五二年增加的产值中，有三分之二以上是从提高劳动生产率而来的。”又指出：“劳动竞赛是提高劳动生产率经常的有效的方法，应该不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。”这是完全正确的。
    几年以来，我国的劳动竞赛已经得到普遍的开展，它对于我国国民经济的恢复与发展，对于过去两年来年度计划的完成，都起了很大的作用。但是，直至现在也还有些同志不重视劳动竞赛。这种错误认识之所以存在，是因为对于群众的作用没有足够的估计，是因为不了解依靠群众的劳动热情和创造精神是社会主义建设的根本特点之一。另外一种情况是把劳动竞赛作为一种突击工作的手段，在平常的时候不组织劳动竞赛，在任务紧急或者是完不成任务的时候，才组织劳动竞赛；并且把劳动竞赛单纯地看作是加班加点，而不了解劳动竞赛应该是一种经常的劳动方式。应当指出，劳动竞赛的发展和生产技术的改进与提高是分不开的，在劳动竞赛中，必须十分注意提高与改进生产技术，改进劳动组织与生产组织。当然，竞赛并不完全排除突击，但主要的不是突击。第三种情况是不把政治教育和物质奖励结合起来，在劳动竞赛中不注意工资工作和工资制度的改进。如果不注意必要的物质奖励，就不能把群众在劳动竞赛中的热情经常保持下去，就不能使劳动竞赛成为经常的劳动方式。第四种情况是有些同志不注意支持群众的合理化建议，不注意推广先进经验，不采取有效的技术组织措施来帮助群众提高定额，突破定额。可是在劳动竞赛中，这恰恰是最中心的问题。
    在组织劳动竞赛的时候，必须同时注意增加生产和厉行节约两个方面，不只是注意增加产量、提高质量，还必须十分注意降低产品成本。正如五年计划草案中所指出的：“产品的成本是表现企业工作质量的基本指标”。在人民民主制度下，精打细算地管理经济，是劳动人民的切身事业。所以在劳动竞赛中，必须逐步推行群众性的班组经济核算，节省原材料，节省燃料、电力，注意工具、机器的维护与修理，延长工具、机器的使用年限。
    各种形式的节约，归根到底就是节约劳动时间——节约活劳动和物化劳动，即提高劳动生产率。各方面节约的结果，都将表现为劳动生产率的提高。
    职工群众不但自己要节约，同时也要反对别人浪费。
    在李富春同志和李先念同志的报告中，我们听到了很多浪费的严重现象，我们自己也看到过许多这种现象。这种浪费现象，必须在党的监督、国家的监督和群众的监督下，彻底加以铲除。关于群众监督的问题，有些同志不很重视，有些同志甚至借口实行一长制来拒绝群众的监督。这是不对的。群众的监督，是党和政府依靠群众向那些贪污浪费、官僚主义、违法乱纪现象进行斗争的一种方式，也是吸引广大群众参加企业管理、依靠群众搞好生产的一种方式。这同一长制是并不矛盾的。有些企业实行一长制以后，应该同群众商量的事情不同群众商量了，应该征求工会意见的事情也不征求工会的意见了，认为“一长制就是厂长说了算”。这当然不能叫做真正的一长制。而接受群众正确的意见，修正自己的错误，才能够使管理工作做得更好一些，才能够更加巩固一长制。
    不少企业一方面劳动力有剩余，一方面又大量加班加点。由于加班加点突击赶工的结果，损害了工人的健康，影响了产品质量，超额支付了工资基金，形成了人力、物力、财力的很大浪费。应当指出，工会对这些现象是没有或者很少起到监督作用的，甚至有些工会干部也参与了。
    最近一个时期，在不少企业中强迫命令、惩办主义、违法乱纪的现象有些滋长。有些厂矿企业在整顿劳动纪律时，主要不是采取说服教育的办法，而主要采取惩罚的办法。当然，加强劳动纪律是十分必要的，但劳动纪律的加强应该建立在群众自觉的基础上。
    在反对浪费、厉行节约的斗争中，在反对官僚主义的斗争中，必须发挥自下而上的群众监督的作用。
    在开展劳动竞赛的同时，必须十分注意加强职工群众的文化教育和技术教育。
    要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，并在几十年内赶上而且超过最强大的资本主义工业国，就必须有一个有文化的、技术水平相当高的工人阶级。可是，我国的工人阶级恰恰在文化、技术方面是落后的。大规模经济建设开始以来，新工人大量增加，很多企业的平均技术熟练程度下降，这是产品质量低、废品多的重要原因之一。这个问题必须加以解决，在党的领导之下，这个问题也是能够解决的。几年以来，工会所进行的文化教育工作，主要着重在扫除文盲和文化娱乐活动，对系统的文化教育工作则做得很差。最近，我们已经和教育部、高等教育部共同协商，准备采取一些具体措施来加强职工的从小学一直到大学的业余文化教育和业余技术教育。
    以上所说的就是工会组织在发挥广大职工的积极性和创造性，努力提高职工的文化技术水平，以提高劳动生产率，保证实现社会主义工业化这一历史任务中的重要职责。同时，全国职工和工会组织，还有责任协助政府逐步实现对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，不断地巩固工农联盟，以保证全部实现第一个五年计划。
    最后，我想说一下关于职工群众的生活问题。
    解放以来，随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，职工群众的生活普遍提高了。但是，也有两种情形是应该提出的：
      一种情形是最近一年多以来，职工群众生活上产生了一些新的困难。困难之所以产生，在私营企业中主要是因为生产不正常、任务不足和一部分资本家借口困难，减发或拖欠工人工资。在国营企业中，有的因为原料不足，生产不正常；有的因为计划不周，管理不善，窝工、停工现象严重；较普遍的是工资工作中存在很多混乱现象。国家有关福利、救济的拨款，有些用得也不适当；某些生活必需品的供应上有缺点。这种情形值得引起各方面的注意。
    另一种情形是有些厂矿企业的生活福利设施标准过高，同我国目前生产水平不相适应，同职工群众的实际生活水平也不相适应。例如，少数工厂宿舍标准过高，房租很高，工人出不起房租，就不能往里搬。所以，一方面各工业城市普遍闹房荒，而另一方面好房子工人住不起。工会所举办的许多事业，设施标准也过高。例如俱乐部、疗养所以至托儿所等等设施标准都过高。由于这种情形的存在，所以花钱很多，而职工群众生活上迫切需要解决的问题又没有得到解决。
    总之，今天职工生活上的若干问题，不是由于工资水平低，也不是由于国家用于职工生活福利的开支少，而是由于我们的工作中有缺点。这些工作中的缺点是必须逐步克服的。
    各位代表：我国的第一个五年计划，已经实行了二年半。过去二年半的实践，完全证明了我国的这个伟大的计划是有把握实现的。毫无问题，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在苏联的真诚帮助下，我国工人阶级一定要和全国人民一起，为胜利地实现第一个五年计划而贡献出自己的一切力量。
    滕代远部长的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，并决心为其实现而奋斗。现在我想就有关铁路五年建设计划以及在铁路建设中厉行节约、反对浪费、降低工程造价的问题，讲一些意见。
    在第一个五年计划中，国家对铁路的基本建设投资为五十六亿七千一百多万元，其中百分之三二·七用于加强和改造现有铁路，百分之二一·五用于增加机车车辆，百分之四一·七用于建筑新路，其他则是用于设计和施工部门的投资，五年内新增加的机车、车辆大部分是用于增加现有铁路的运输能力的，因此，五年内铁路的基本建设投资半数以上是用于加强和改造现有铁路的。这个投资比例是符合我国当前铁路设备情况的，也是同第一个五年计划期间国家对铁路的运输需要相适应的。
    在解放以前，我国铁路大部分是由各个帝国主义国家当作侵略我国的工具分头修建起来的，因而数量很少，各种技术装备的类型和标准都很复杂，同时绝大部分又分布在沿海地带，而在广大的腹地，特别是西南、西北地区则没有或只有很少铁路。这种技术装备落后和线路分布不平衡的状态，当然不能适应社会主义建设对铁路运输的需要，但也不是在第一个五年计划期间所能完全改变的。
    在解放以后，由于国民经济的迅速恢复，一九五二年我国铁路平均每公里全年通过的运输量已达三五四万吨，预料到一九五七年将达到五五七万吨。可是，我们现有铁路的技术装备是很落后的，我们现有复线仅占铁路总长度百分之六，站线仅占总长度百分之三一·五，运输枢纽站没有一处有驼峰设备。我国铁路这种技术装备落后的情况说明两个问题：第一说明我国铁路所负担的工作量是十分沉重的；第二说明我国铁路的后备力量是极为贫乏的。还必须说明：我国第一个五年计划期间新建、改建的限额以上的六九四个工业建设单位，特别是苏联帮助设计的一五六个建设单位，多半在第二个五年计划初期建成或开始大量投入生产。可以想见，一九五九、一九六○年的铁路运输量将会有更大的增加，而所有这些工业建设绝大部分是分布在现有铁路沿线的。也就是说，新增加的巨大运输量还是要由现有铁路来负担。这就是在分配铁路投资时不得不把半数以上的投资放在加强和改造现有铁路方面的主要根据。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们修建新铁路的数量还不能满足各方面的要求。修建铁路是一件艰巨的工作，不但需要大量资金，而且更重要的是需要很大的技术力量。我们几年来修建铁路的经验，就证明了这一点。如丰台到沙城铁路全长一百多公里，仅勘测设计这条铁路，折合起来就需要四六○个技术人员一整年的工作。因此，就我们当前的和可能培养的勘测设计能力和施工能力来看，这五年内新建铁路的数量是不少的，而且基本上也是同整个经济建设相适应的。当然我们全国铁路职工还应该努力争取超额完成，以便更好地满足国家和人民的运输需要。
    为了完成五年铁路建设计划，我们除了动员广大职工发挥高度的积极性和创造性，保证完成每个年度计划外，还进行了一系列的建设准备工作。例如为了适应未来大量运输需要，我们正在进行机车、车辆和钢轨的定型工作；为了提高运输繁忙线路的通过能力和保证行车安全，我们正在进行自动闭塞和半自动闭塞装置的定型工作；为了更好地确定现有铁路技术改造的规模和步骤，我们一方面正在对于铁路现有技术装备能力的利用情况进行调查，另一方面正在积极从事近期和远期的铁路货物运输量的研究。在勘测设计方面，几年来也不断增强着技术力量，根据施工经验和降低造价的要求，正在修改设计规程和设计预算定额；为了加速新线建设，在兰新线玉门以西已经开始利用航空测量，争取在一九五七年底完成全部勘测设计任务。同时，我们积极准备采取措施，争取成都到宝鸡的铁路在一九五六年底通车，鹰潭到厦门的铁路争取较原订计划提前建成。
    五年计划的时间已经过去了一半，在这两年半时间里，由于党和毛主席的正确领导，全国人民和各地党、政机关的热烈支援，全路职工的忘我劳动和苏联专家的热忱帮助，我们已经完成了铁路五年修建计划百分之四○的任务，同时还摸到了一些经验，培养了一批干部，这就对五年计划的实现提供了一定的保证。
    铁路是国家基本建设投资较大的一个部门。因此，在铁路上实行严格的节约制度，反对浪费，降低造价，降低非生产性建设的标准，学习苏联建设社会主义的经验和坚持我们党在长期革命斗争中养成的艰苦朴素的优良传统，节约地使用国家的建设资金，是具有极大的意义的。
    为了贯彻中央关于降低造价的指示，今年第二季度，我们曾组织了检查组，检查了西北、西南地区的新建铁路工作，发现铁路基本建设工程中的浪费现象是严重的。
    首先表现在盲目提高标准，特别是很多非生产性的建设该小的做大了，该少的做多了，该低的做高了，甚至根本不必要的也做了。例如车站的房屋过大，厕所太多，宿舍单价过高，许多临时工棚的造价每平方公尺竟高达四十元，名为“临时”，实际可用十五至二十年。在生产性建设方面也有盲目提高标准的情况，如成渝路七对通信电线，用一对铜线即可，而我们却用了五对，严重地浪费了国家的有色金属。
    其次，有些生产性建设，在营业初期没有必要，形成过早的投资，实质上也是浪费。例如开设了很多不必要的车站，有些车站的股道铺的过多。在铁路干线营业初期，每公里铺设一、六○○根枕木即可，我们却不管初期运量多少，一律铺了一、八四○根；石碴厚度铺设三五公分即可，我们却铺设了四五公分以上。这种盲目追求安全系数和过早的投资，既分散了国家的建设资金，影响经济建设的进度，又增加了大修和经常维修的费用。
    再次是盲目追求形式，增加了许多不必要的工程，造成浪费。例如沿线房屋建筑原可利用自然地形，我们的设计人员为了追求美观，硬要把它们都放在同一水平上，做了很多不必要的填方和挖方工程。对于房屋也做了很多不必要的修饰，清水砖墙本来很好看也很坚固，偏偏又抹上一层洋灰，既浪费了钱，而且洋灰容易剥落，又增加了将来修理的次数和费用。沿线桥墩桥台和隧道衬砌所用的料石，本来只要把向外的一面四周边缘打琢一寸左右即可，我们却打得六面见光，以致工时普遍超过一至二倍。兰新线沿线人口稀少，有些地区百十公里无人烟，我们还在道口修建了看守房，派上道口看守工。很多车站甚至在人口稀少的地方，都装上几百公尺的油漆栅栏和水泥站台。
    此外，由于设计技术上的错误，施工组织不好，不注意就地取材，劳动生产率低，机械使用不善，材料管理混乱和质量低劣等造成的浪费也是严重的。如宝成线绵阳、广元段的安昌江桥，由于桥位选择不当，三年来支出的防洪费用，已为该桥造价的二倍，现在还不得不另建新桥，这就是由于设计错误造成严重浪费的显著的例子。
    造成以上浪费的根源，主要是由于我们领导干部和工程技术人员缺乏经济观点，对中央厉行节约、重点建设的方针的重要意义认识不足，因此对铁路投资的重点应该根据运输的需要和为运输服务的思想不明确，造成分散投资；有些虽然认识了投资重点应放在运输需要上，但不知道区分现在需要和将来需要，因而造成过早的投资。其次是缺乏对国家负责的精神，施工人员机械地按设计行事，发现浪费也不据理力争，反正错了由设计负责。设计人员怕负责任，无限制地提高设计标准，盲目提高安全系数，以及过分迁就使用部门的要求等，致使国家遭受损失。第三、骄傲自满情绪也是造成浪费的主要原因之一。铁路工作几年来取得了一些成绩，因而使我们领导干部滋长了骄傲自满情绪，有了这种情绪就必然产生盲目保守、固步自封和自以为是的主观主义，就会产生盲目追求形式、盲目提高标准和不切实际的作风，这是极端危险的资产阶级唯心主义的思想，必须纠正。以上这些思想同铁道部领导水平不高，缺乏认真的检查分不开的。
    为了厉行节约、反对浪费、降低工程造价，在保证铁路建设的进度与应有的质量标准下，我们认为必须采取如下措施：
    一、动员全体职工厉行节约，反对浪费，努力增产，降低工程造价及成本，并贯彻重点建设精神，坚持需要与可能相结合的原则，凡可做可不做的工程坚决不做；可缓做的必须缓做；可少做的尽量少做；根本不必要的绝对不做。经过我们检查发现，在新线修建中有十种工程应当坚决取消，例如取消桥号标，把桥号标写在桥台上，取消无农田地段的铁路界标等，这样可以为国家节省很多建设资金。
    二、改变过高的设计标准。例如在线路设计上，尽量就地利用河卵石，非干线铁路的路基以及一切岔线的路基宽度，视土质情况，可以减为四·五或五公尺。桥梁设计上，小桥可不设栏杆，大桥设木质栏杆，不冻结及不受冲刷的桥墩基础可采用较低级的混凝土或浆砌片石。在隧道设计上，边墙拱圈可以片石代替料石，隧道石质坚硬的，可以不加衬砌。在房屋设计上，应注意就地取材；临时房屋尽量少建，单价减至每平方公尺十元；正式房屋亦应减少，单价应以不超过中央规定的限额为原则。
    三、修改设计规程，调整设计预算，提高设计技术。原设计规程应根据反对浪费、厉行节约、降低造价、重点建设的精神区别生产性建设和非生产性建设，区别现在需要和将来需要，分别予以修订。过去预算做得过大的，劳动定额过低的，都应根据实际情况加以调整。特别是过去设计时，很少考虑利用自然地形和就地取材，增加了许多运费支出和不必要的工程。因此，必须重新审查设计文件，审查线路、建筑对地形的利用程度，审查车站及附属技术设备设计的位置是否恰当，审查设计时是否尽量避免了临时性的建筑，以免花费双重费用等。必须加强设计前的经济调查和地形地质水文调查，加强施工及营业期间的经济比较，慎重地决定设计项目。
    四、改善施工组织，加强基本建设、设计、施工三个部门之间的配合协作，做好施工安排。每一工点必须有统一的施工组织设计和统一的施工领导，大力推行先进施工方法，如大爆破、水风钻、小型机械化等，并推行计件工资，加强劳动组织，以节省工费，提高劳动生产率；加强机械及材料管理，充分发挥机具的使用率，认真做好材料试验工作，增加模型板、支撑木及脚手架的使用次数，以节省机械使用费及材料费；尽量采取措施，在保证质量的条件下，争取提前完工，交付营业，以便早日为国家积累资金。
    五、精简机构，紧缩编制，大量减少非生产人员，暂时停止招收新职工，停止临时工转正。坚决裁并一切可有可无及重复的机构。全路职工，特别是领导干部，要养成艰苦朴素的作风，不但要从大的方面，而且要从小的方面去厉行节约。
    根据上述措施，我们已拟出了六○项具体执行办法，将一九五五年至一九五七年铁路基本建设工作量加以计算，如果这些办法得以贯彻，那末三年平均可以较原投资总额（扣除钢轨、钢梁等价值以后）降低百分之二六·九，仅一九五五年即可为国家节约一七、三九九万元。
    为了全面地反对浪费和贯彻增产节约原则，除了降低工程造价之外，全国铁路必须进一步改善经营管理，积极开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，加速机车车辆的周转，提高劳动生产率，要求一九五五年的铁路运输成本较原计划再降低百分之一·○五，大修工程费降低百分之四，附属企业成本再降低百分之二。其中主要指标如每辆货车平均装载量要求比原计划提高○·二吨，可增产一、○○○万元；机车牵引重量要求比标准重量超过四、○○○万吨，每日可节省机车三四台；每台机车平均每天走行公里要求增加四公里，每日可节省机车十八台。这就是一九五五年全国铁路职工的奋斗目标。
    在这次会议上代表们对铁路建设工作的建议，我们当仔细的研究并考虑采纳。代表们对铁路工作的批评，我们愿意保证在今后工作中加以改进。
    为保证铁路建设和运输任务的顺利完成，还必须在全国铁路上开展肃清暗藏的反革命分子的运动，提高全路职工的政治警惕，以便进一步审查和清除一切暗藏的反革命分子。同时，还要和盗窃分子斗争，防止国家资财遭受损失和破坏。
    我们相信，我们全体铁路职工在中国共产党和政府的领导下，在全国人民的支援和监督之下，在铁路内部先进工作者的积极带头和影响之下，努力学习苏联先进经验，经常以批评和自我批评的精神揭露我们工作中的缺点和错误，力戒骄傲自满，兢兢业业，艰苦奋斗，我们一定能够完成全国人民代表大会所给予我们的光荣任务。我们一定能够保证完成第一个五年计划中关于铁路的修建和运输任务。
    蔡畅代表的发言
    我完全拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。这些报告，充分地反映了全国人民建设祖国、保卫和平的共同愿望。证明了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业已经迈步前进并取得了重大的胜利。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是中国共产党领导全中国人民为实现过渡时期总任务，为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的具有决定意义的第一步。第一个五年计划是以发展重工业为中心，并相应地发展农业、轻工业、交通运输和文化教育事业，这是完全正确的，因为只有努力发展重工业，发展社会生产力，实行社会主义工业化，才能有改造全部国民经济和改善人民生活的物质基础。第一个五年计划草案中所规定的对农业、手工业和私人工商业的社会主义改造的部署是完全正确的，是适合于中国实际情况的。总之，第一个五年计划草案所规定的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的任务、方针和步骤是正确地体现了我国宪法所规定的过渡时期总任务的。因此第一个五年计划草案所规定的各项事业发展的指标、比重和速度也是很恰当的，这是一个中国历史上空前未有的伟大计划，是能够鼓舞全国人民和动员全国人民努力争取实现的。实现了这个计划，将为我国的社会主义工业化打下初步基础，为农业和手工业的社会主义改造打下初步基础，为私营工商业的社会主义改造打下基础。打下了这些基础，实现过渡时期的总任务就更有保证了，实现中国妇女的彻底解放也就更有保证了，我们庆祝发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的产生。我们坚决拥护这个计划草案，我们也完全赞成这个计划草案上所表现出来的增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费的坚决精神。
    经过小组讨论之后，我们越是感到五年计划的伟大和它与全国人民的长远利益和最高利益的密切关系，也越是感到全国人民为建立社会主义强大的物质基础而对完成五年计划所负责任的重大。中国人民在英明正确的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，几十年来，艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，百折不挠，所追求的就是人民的解放和人民的幸福。由于中国劳动人民和其他各阶层人民的一致努力，已经取得了中国人民革命的伟大胜利；由于中国劳动人民和其他各阶层人民的一致努力，又取得了恢复国民经济的胜利，顺利地进入到社会主义的计划经济建设时期。这些都证明中国人民为着自己的解放和美满幸福的未来，是有决心克服一切困难和完成一切任务的。第一个五年计划的制定和实行，一个社会主义的、富强的新中国已经在望，因此，不管完成五年计划是如何艰巨，全中国人民不分男女是一定能够兢兢业业，克服困难，完成和超额完成伟大的第一个五年计划的。
    李富春副总理在报告中号召：“妇女们也应该提高政治觉悟，提高生产和工作的能力，积极地参加国家建设事业。”我们坚决响应这个号召，我们能够这样做，我们一定这样做。我们为了建设社会主义，不论在城市和乡村，我们将在不同的生产战线上，在不同的工作岗位上，在广大的家庭中，从各个方面发挥我们各自不同的作用，积极地参加国家建设事业。
    全国妇女在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，已经积极地参加了中国人民革命胜利的伟大斗争，从而使我们赢得了一个在政治上、社会上、经济上男女平等的新中国，我们必须更加百倍地努力进行社会主义的建设，巩固和发展这个新中国，因为只有经济的不断发展，生产力的不断提高，我国才能最后消灭剥削制度，我们的生活才能更加幸福，我们的文化才能更加提高，妇女也才能得到彻底解放。因此第一个五年计划正是关系我们妇女的切身利益和最高利益的大事业，我们还能不以百倍努力来为它的实现而艰苦奋斗么？
    我们全国妇女，不论是女工、农妇、各种工作岗位上的女工作人员、女学生、职工家属和各阶层的妇女，为第一个五年计划而共同努力奋斗的中心是什么咧？那就是增加生产、厉行节约。增加生产、厉行节约是积累资金以建设社会主义社会唯一的道路，是全国人民经常的长期的政治任务，为此全国妇联一定要为发展生产，积累资金，完成五年计划，在全国妇女中展开增产节约运动。我们要求在各种岗位上的女工们，同男工一起，共同参加劳动竞赛，为提高劳动生产率，节约原料材料，降低成本，增加生产而努力。我们要求广大的农村妇女们，积极参加以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，不断提高粮食和工业原料作物的产量；并在节约粮食的原则下，尽可能多地饲养家畜、家禽，增加肉类、蛋类的生产。我们要求广大的职工家属和各阶层家庭妇女们，女学生们，除了努力学习外，还要勤劳朴素地过生活，养成我们勤俭朴素的治家治国的风气。
    我们妇女对增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费是有认识有决心的。我们看见，在工业农业生产战线上，已经涌现出大批的英雄模范、生产革新者和优秀干部，在职工家属和家庭妇女中，有着许多厉行节约的模范人物和事例：有的在勇敢地与贪污、浪费现象作斗争，有的精打细算，节约粮食、用棉、水电、瓦斯、煤炭；有的配合厂矿回收废料，或者经常注意收集破铜烂铁，献给国家。这些事实，不仅说明了广大妇女都能在增加生产、厉行节约中贡献出自己的一份力量，为完成第一个五年计划服务；同时也证明了我们妇女对建设社会主义祖国的热情和积极性是很高的。今后，全国妇女一定会更加努力，继续增加生产，认真节约，为国家积累更多的财富，为社会主义建设积累更多的资金。
    我们要保卫社会主义建设，还必须提高我们的政治警惕。要警惕帝国主义分子、蒋介石匪帮以及一切残余的反革命分子的阴谋破坏。我们要警惕帝国主义者准备新战争的阴谋。我们要响应第一次世界母亲大会的号召，同全世界的妇女团结起来，同全世界保卫和平的人民一道，为反对战争保卫和平而奋斗。
    谢扶民代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，以及李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”。
    国家在恢复国民经济的基础上制定的第一个五年计划，规定了在这五年内祖国伟大的社会主义建设的规模，并在具体任务的规定中，在各项建设的措施中，切实地照顾了少数民族的特点和需要，充分保障了少数民族的政治、经济、文化等方面的权利，贯彻了民族平等互助的精神。我们相信，这个伟大计划的实现，将给全国各族人民带来更大的繁荣和幸福。因而这个引导着我国各族人民沿着社会主义道路前进的计划，也一定会得到全国人民的热烈拥护。
    我国第一个五年计划确定了以社会主义工业化建设为中心，这一方针是完全正确的，是符合于我国各族人民的长远和最高利益的。从僮族地区来说，几年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在统一的祖国大家庭内，政治上、经济上、文化上都有了一定的提高和发展。在互助合作运动中，农业生产已获得了很大的增产，人民的生活有了初步的改善。但目前在经济上、文化上都还比较落后，农业生产水平还很低，特别是山区的僮族和其他民族的农业生产水平则更低，在第一个五年计划内，我们充分的利用自然条件，注意挖掘生产潜力，农业生产仍可在现有基础上进一步的增产。但从长远看，要根本改变这一落后状况，则只有国家逐步实现社会主义工业化，打下改造国民经济的物质基础，才能提供必要的条件。因此，发展社会主义工业，特别是发展重工业，是同我们少数民族经济、文化的发展和人民的幸福息息相关的，这也是各族人民长时期来的共同愿望。
    在贯彻执行国家第一个五年计划当中，僮族地区在国家统一计划下，并从具体情况出发，主要是按照以增产粮食为主，同时发展多种经济的方针，开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动，发展农业生产，以积极支援和配合国家的工业化建设。两年多来根据这一方针进行工作，已取得了一定的成绩。农业互助合作得到了相当的发展，桂西僮族自治区已建立了七千零三十四个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全自治区农户总数百分之八点六，加上各种类型的互助组，组织起来的农户已达到全区农户总数百分之六十七点二。在互助合作的基础上，农业连年获得增产，其他林业、技术作物、土产特产亦有所发展。逐年重点地修建了公路，最近完成修筑的黎（塘）湛（江）铁路对发展我们的经济文化关系很大。这些成就，一方面改善了人民生活，同时在粮食、木材、土产特产等方面也直接支援了国家工业化建设。僮族人民在自己新的生活中，已看到了社会主义社会和本民族发展的美好前途，正在为自己的幸福事业而辛勤地劳动。
    国家第一个五年计划的制定，给予我们巨大的鼓舞力量。我们有充分信心，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，更进一步加强民族团结，加强各民族间经济和文化的联系和合作，动员僮族人民和各族人民深入地学习和领会国家第一个五年计划，加强对国家建设的整体观念，积极的参与祖国的经济建设，特别是按照国家计划要求，根据我们当地条件，努力搞好生产，争取农业的更大增产，以逐步提高僮族人民的经济文化生活，给国家建设以更多的支援。这是我们的迫切任务。
    让我们共同为完成或超额完成国家第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    夏以焜代表的发言
    李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，指出了国家建设的光明大道和今后的工作方针，参照了苏联的先进经验并结合了我国的实际情况，以发展重工业为重点，按部就班的并以相当快的速度来建设我们的国家。在这第一个五年计划的巩固基础上，我们全国人民有信心在大约三个五年计划的时间内建成社会主义社会，使我国人民能享受和平幸福的生活，并继续努力向着共产主义社会的崇高目标迈步前进。我衷心地拥护这两个报告，建议大会予以通过和批准。
    第一个五年建设计划的规模是很大的，工作中间的困难也一定是很多的。但是，我们有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，我们有丰富的资源，有众多的人力，并有苏联在精神上、物质上和技术上无私的兄弟般的援助，只要我们努力的工作，我们相信一切困难都是能够克服的。在第一个五年计划的工作中，我们技术工作人员，有着重大的责任来完成我们应当担负的光荣的和艰巨的任务。
    我是一个钢铁工厂的设计工作者。在国民党反动统治时期，中国就没有什么钢铁工业。所以我们虽然想着要为国家做一些建设工作，但终究是一场幻想。只有在全国解放后的新中国，在共产党的领导下，劳动人民掌握了政权，才有可能编制这样一部伟大的第一个五年计划，从事大规模的工业建设，技术人员才有机会把所学的替国家和人民服务，才可能在实际工作中提高自己的技术水平，尤其在苏联专家的热情帮助下学会以前所不可能学到的知识和技能。我现在能够参加国家大规模和现代化的钢铁厂设计工作，感到无上的荣幸，我一定要努力学习，在我的工作岗位上尽到我的光荣职责。
    在第一个五年计划的工作中，我们钢铁厂设计工作者要保证做到下列几点：
      一、要妥当地并节约地利用国家的资源。我们国家的资源是丰富的，但是由于勘探力量的限制，不可能在很短的时间内，就能够找到足够的在工业上所需的原料，以致在工业建设的过程中每每有原材料不足的现象。所以我们要尽量地珍惜我们国家的资源，不能有丝毫的浪费。譬如制造普通的耐火砖，便不能应用含铝极高的耐火粘土，以便把它用来作为炼铝的原料，否则就是浪费资源。又如粉状铁矿，一定要想法利用。在炼焦方面要提高洗煤的回收率，焦炭的生产要和炼铁取得平衡，以免浪费宝贵的炼焦用煤。
    二、要接受新事物，克服保守思想。设计中的保守思想，足以造成国家资财的重大浪费。在钢铁工厂的设计工作中，如果不能接受苏联的先进指标而按照旧的资料进行设计，那末在同一产量的钢铁厂，可能需要加倍的投资，譬如对炼铁炉的炉容利用率如保守一些，那末在一个钢铁厂内可能要多建一座到两座的大型炼铁炉，就会增加很多的投资。又如一千一百五十公厘的初轧机，按照美国的指标，每年只能轧制一百多万吨钢锭，但按照苏联的先进指标，每年可轧制三百万吨的钢锭，而初轧机的投资是很大的，多装了一架初轧机要浪费了很大的资金。所以我们要努力学习苏联的先进经验，对新事物要有敏感，不要强调客观困难，应当克服一切困难来采用新的先进指标。
    三、要反对松懈，要紧张地工作和学习。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我们做的各项企业的设计，都是采用了苏联的最新科学成就和先进的指标，有些在苏联还是第一次的设计。譬如为了武汉某钢铁厂的设计，苏联政府曾下了命令要限期赶工优先完成我们的设计。他们发挥了无私的热情和兄弟般的国际友爱精神来帮助我们，我们应该表示衷心的感谢。我们一定要学会他们替我们所做的设计并准期和争取提前提供设计资料。他们这样的忘我劳动，紧张的替我们完成工作，而我们反把提交资料的工作予以拖延，这是极端错误的。所以我们设计技术人员要端正设计思想，要学习马列主义，要树立全心全意为人民服务和负责的观点。
    四、要克服浪费现象。在设计上的浪费，表面上有些看不出来，但图纸上和设计上稍不留意，就会造成很大浪费，尤其在大规模的建设单位，随便地放宽一下，就要浪费几万元甚至更多的资金，我们要明了国家建设资金的积累并不容易，要精打细算，不能随便浪费一文钱，这样才能对得起国家和人民。
    五、在设计中要尽量利用和改进旧设备。企业方面和设计方面的技术人员，为了追求新颖或怕麻烦，往往在企业扩建工作中，主张废弃一切旧设备和旧厂房，不想怎样去改进它并尽量地利用它，这样就会大大地增加国家投资。苏联之所以能这样的迅速发展工业生产，大部分是由于不断地改进旧工厂，提高了生产力。我们第一个五年计划的增产任务，有百分之七十是要依靠原有企业完成的。所以有些企业中的负责同志存在着的厌旧喜新心理，是应该改正的。
    我们技术人员一定要和工人群众一起站在工业建设的最前线，要毫无保留地贡献出一切力量为人民服务，在自己的工作岗位上努力工作，保证第一个五年计划的如期和提前完成。
    董必武院长的发言
    听了李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长兼秘书长的报告，我完全同意。我提议大会通过中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和兵役法草案，批准一九五四年国家决算、一九五五年国家预算和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并采纳根治和开发黄河的综合规划的原则和基本内容。
    我国第一个五年计划是一个伟大的计划，是实现我国宪法上规定的国家过渡时期总任务的一个重大步骤。这个计划的实现，将开始改变我国国民经济的面貌，将使我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业奠定初步的基础；我国保卫和平民主的国防力量将进一步地加强，我国人民的物质生活和文化生活将有可能进一步地改善。这个计划的实现，将是我国人民在毛泽东主席领导下，继新民主主义革命胜利后向社会主义前进途中取得的又一个伟大的胜利。人民的胜利，即是人民敌人的失败。人民的胜利越大，人民敌人的失败就越惨。因此，帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团、国内已被消灭了的阶级残余和被迫要退出历史舞台的阶级中顽抗改造的分子是不甘心他们的失败的，更是不愿意人民取得新的胜利的。他们必然千方百计地破坏我国的五年计划。这就是说，五年计划必然是而且只能是在一种复杂的、尖锐的阶级斗争中来实现。人民法院是我们国家的审判机关。人民法院必须把国家法律的锋芒，指向一切危害国家安全和破坏经济建设的反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子，同时解决各种民事纠纷，保卫人民民主制度，维护公共秩序，保护公共财产，保护公民的权利和合法利益。人民法院和公安、检察机关作好这些工作，在保障实现五年计划的方面具有非常重大的作用。人民法院依法调整人民内部的关系，通过审判的方式教育人民遵守国家法纪，这对实现五年计划也有积极的作用。
    两年多来，最高人民法院和地方各级人民法院在为经济建设服务的方针下，进行了不少的工作。全国各省、市人民法院中，在人民法院组织法公布以前，曾有一百二十多个专门审理有关经济建设案件的审判组织。全国现已建立起十一个铁路运输专门法院和两个水上运输专门法院。最高人民法院也设立了铁路水上运输审判庭。据不完全的统计，仅从一九五四年一月至一九五五年三月底，全国各级人民法院就受理了二十五万五千零九十一件有关经济建设的初审案件。在保卫工厂、矿山、基本建设、交通运输等企业方面，人民法院和公安、检察机关，有力地打击了反革命分子和贪污分子、盗窃分子的犯罪活动，处理了一部分重大责任事故的案件；在审判案件同时，对职工群众进行了提高革命警惕性、爱护国家财产和遵守劳动纪律的宣传教育。有些人民法院把在审理经济建设案件中所发现的问题和工作中的漏洞，向有关的主管部门提出了改进工作和预防犯罪的建议。在保障资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面，各地人民法院、特别是城市人民法院一般能主动地结合中心工作，有重点地打击了偷漏国税、破坏加工订货、破坏市场管理以及抽逃资金损害生产等破坏国家经济建设的犯罪分子。这样，既打击了不法资本家的犯罪活动，又扩大了对一般工商业者的爱国守法教育。在保障农业生产和农业社会主义改造方面，各地基层人民法院惩处了一些破坏生产和互助合作的罪犯，消除了农民的顾虑，提高了农民的政治觉悟和生产积极性。同时，各地人民法院还积极地从审判工作方面保障了防汛救灾和粮食统购统销等中心工作的顺利进行，对扰乱社会治安的盗贼、流氓等社会渣滓进行了坚决的斗争。所有人民法院的这些工作，对经济建设的配合具有重大的意义。
    人民法院在为经济建设服务的工作中并不是作得很圆满。司法工作为经济建设服务的方针早定下了，但并非每一个司法工作人员对这个方针都有深刻的认识，特别是司法工作人员对法律的和经济的知识一般都较贫乏，加以这方面的法规又不完备，积累这方面的系统经验还很不够。人民法院曾在若干厂矿企业中进行了重点试验，但实际上只是摸了一下，一般是搞得不深不透的。在城市如何对破坏分子进行斗争和在乡村怎样保障互助合作运动的巩固和发展，我们都没有进行深入的调查研究和系统的总结经验。这些缺点和困难只有在今后实践中逐渐加以克服。
    中华人民共和国宪法、中华人民共和国人民法院组织法公布后，司法部和最高人民法院于一九五四年十一月召开了省、市级以上人民法院院长和司法厅、局长的司法座谈会，集中学习了宪法和人民法院组织法，并研究了如何动员、组织全国司法干部学习和贯彻人民法院组织法。关于这次座谈会的情况，我们已经向全国人民代表大会常务委员会作了报告。会议以后，全国各高级人民法院和司法厅、局都先后召开了学习和贯彻人民法院组织法的会议，半年多以来，各地人民法院学习和贯彻人民法院组织法是有很大成绩的。凡是已经开过人民代表大会会议的地方，都依照宪法规定分别选举了当地的高级人民法院、中级人民法院和基层人民法院的院长，有些地区加强了人民法院的组织机构；各级人民法院都建立了或正在建立各项审判制度；司法干部经过学习，一般提高了政治觉悟、加强了法制观念，初步改善了审判作风，提高了审判工作质量。但仍有不少的人民法院在学习和贯彻人民法院组织法中缺乏联系实际的精神，没有很好地结合学习检查本身的工作和思想作风，也就没有很好地理解人民法院组织法的精神和实质，保守思想尚未完全克服，有的在学习和贯彻人民法院组织法中还产生了形式地推行各项审判制度的现象。总的来看，目前各地人民法院贯彻人民法院组织法还只是开始，必须进一步地努力以求贯彻。
    为了了解和检查各级人民法院学习和贯彻人民法院组织法的情况，司法部在座谈会后即派员赴各省视察。最高人民法院随着派员到河北、山东、江苏、安徽、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁等省有重点地了解和检查高级人民法院和各下级人民法院的工作，发现了不少的问题。司法部和最高人民法院又于本年五月召开了有各高级人民法院院长、各司法厅、局长和部分市中级人民法院院长参加的司法座谈会，除检查了各级人民法院学习和贯彻人民法院组织法的情况外，并着重解决了以下两个问题：
    首先是对于目前政治形势的正确认识问题。座谈会开始，出席的人都知道第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议就要开会决定我国第一个五年计划；有不少干部以为我国第一个五年计划是在恢复时期各种伟大胜利的基础上制定的，五年计划头两年的总产值又已超额完成了，但他们满足于我们在经济建设上的重大成就，同时为过去镇压反革命运动和其他各种社会改革运动的胜利所陶醉，滋长着一种极为有害的太平麻痹情绪，因而对于我国是处在帝国主义包围中，我国内部还是阶级社会，以及我国当前阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性，都缺乏应有的认识，甚至把它忘掉了。他们不了解，虽然经过大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，在此以后也不断地给反革命分子以打击，残余反革命势力是越来越少了，但在社会主义改造过程中，必然会产生一批新的反革命分子，同时他们的破坏活动却更加阴险毒辣了。他们钻入和潜伏在我们的国家机关、团体、厂矿、交通运输企业、基本建设工程等，利用各种机会，进行各种阴谋破坏活动。我们如果不对这些阴谋破坏活动给以坚决的镇压和打击，我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业就不能顺利地进行，五年计划的胜利完成就得不到保障。座谈会上，大家以批评和自我批评的精神，揭发和批判了不少人民法院干部盲目自满、轻敌麻痹的思想，以及由此产生的对反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子重罪轻判、打击不力，和审判工作脱离政治斗争、孤立办案等偏向，大家决心把中共中央和毛泽东主席指示的“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”，作为人民法院审判工作的指针，给一切反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子以准确的严厉的打击。
    其次，检查和批判了在人民法院中当前残存着的一些坏的审判作风。它的主要表现是在审理案件时先入为主，偏听偏信，主观臆断，轻信口供而不重证据。这种坏的审判作风，妨碍了审判工作的正确进行，甚至宽纵了犯罪分子，冤屈了无辜的人民，在群众中造成不良的影响。这实际上就是资产阶级唯心主义思想在我们审判工作中的反映。针对这些情况，我们提出了一些改善审判作风的办法，其中主要的是：上级人民法院对下级人民法院不仅要加强审判工作的监督，还应当加强政治思想的领导；人民法院工作人员必须认真学习辩证唯物主义和国家政策、法律、法令；人民法院的审判员必须严格掌握从实际出发，依靠群众，调查研究，实事求是，重证据不轻信口供等原则；各级人民法院必须在各级人民代表大会严格监督下进行审判工作。
    最高人民法院内部也组织了全体参与审判工作人员进行人民法院组织法的学习，我们遵照人民法院组织法的规定，设立了各审判庭，各审判庭审理案件亦都按照人民法院组织法规定的几种审判制度进行，特别如合议制和公开审判制是早已在最高人民法院内建立起来了。关于书记员工作亦按照人民法院组织法中有关书记员职责的规定，进行了初步的整顿。我们的审判工作，是在集体领导和群众监督之下进行的，因而不仅保证了判案的准确，而且也教育了群众。
    在本年第一季度里，最高人民法院对过去半年来处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作作了一次检查，最高人民法院人民接待室半年中处理了人民来信三千八百二十五件，接见了来访群众九百五十四人，其中属于诉讼问题的申诉占百分之九十以上，而不服各级人民法院的判决和裁定的申诉又占百分之六十以上。由此可见，我们处理来信和接待来访的工作，是联系群众、实行审判监督的一项重要方式。过去我们对这方面的工作注意不够，被动应付和积压来信的现象都有，人民群众对于这些是不满意的。经过这次检查整顿，从组织上制度上加强了这项工作，积压来信的现象已基本上清除了。我们开始建立了院长、庭长处理重要来信和轮值接见来访群众的制度，以便更妥善地解决人民群众提出的问题，并通过这项工作，实行对下级人民法院的审判监督。
    人民法院设立审判委员会，是人民法院组织法中规定了的。最高人民法院审判委员会于本年三月间依法成立。审判委员会成立后首先注意到总结审判经验。我们已把搜集到的十四个大城市高、中级人民法院关于刑事案件审理程序和十三个大城市高、中级人民法院关于民事案件审理程序的实际资料，提交审判委员会进行总结。这是一项相当繁重的工作，审判委员会开会四次，整个工作历时半年，在这次司法座谈会上还经过出席院长们讨论和修改，最后经最高人民法院审判委员会审定，才编为十三、十四个大城市人民法院关于民、刑案件审理程序的经验总结。各大城市人民法院原各有一套自定的成文的或不成文的审理民、刑案件的程序，经验是丰富的，但很不统一。最高人民法院审判委员会总结这类的经验，只是把各大城市人民法院审理民、刑案件的程序加以综合。处理案件用不同手续的，我们把它改得相同；对同样内容用不同术语表达的，我们把它改得一致。我们也想把各大城市人民法院审理民、刑案件的程序略为提高一点，即想把它提高到符合于人民法院组织法的要求。因此，这两个文件仅是人民法院审判工作的部分经验总结，审判委员会审定后已印发各大、中城市人民法院参酌试行，并报请全国人民代表大会常务委员会备案。至于各省高级人民法院关于民、刑案件审理程序的经验，我们计划在本年下半年进行总结。全国各省的中级人民法院、基层人民法院关于民、刑案件审理程序的资料要到明年才能搜集到手。总结这几部分的经验，自然归入我们明年的工作计划。
    我们知道，最高人民法院和地方各级人民法院在审判工作中的缺点和错误是不少的。我恳切希望全国人民代表大会、全国人民代表大会常务委员会和地方各级人民代表大会对我们人民法院的审判工作严加监督和批评，以便我们消弭缺点，纠正错误，不断地改进工作。最近在北京市十个区的人民代表大会第三次会议上，各区人民代表对人民法院的工作报告作了认真的审查，并提出了严肃的批评。据不完全统计，这次各区人民代表对市、区人民法院工作提出了五百四十条意见，经归纳为三百八十五条，其中属于表扬的有六十四条，属于批评的有二百零二条，属于建议的有一百一十九条。这些批评和建议的意见都很宝贵，鞭策着和鼓舞着人民法院工作者为保障我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的胜利完成而奋斗。
    沈钧儒副委员长的发言
    这次会议的中心议题是决定发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，审查和批准一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算。
    对于五年计划草案和国家预决算我完全同意。
    第一个五年计划是中国共产党和政府领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。
    这是一个实现社会主义的纲领。
    社会主义是为了什么呢？就是为国家谋富强，为子孙谋幸福，为世界谋和平。
    这是使我国历史改变方向、社会改变面貌的伟大事业。因此，这就需要我们全国人民，在工人阶级和共产党领导之下，兢兢业业，努力工作，才能保证五年计划的顺利实现和社会主义伟大事业的最后胜利。
    我在这里特别要说一说，我们知识分子应该做什么和如何做的问题。
    要使文化、科学、技术落后的中国，变为社会主义的工业化的中国，必须依靠中国共产党的领导和全国劳动人民的共同努力，但是知识分子也应当担负起重大责任。我们要大量培养建设人材，提高技术水平，要向全国人民进行政治理论科学技术教育。总而言之，要使文化、科学、技术为五年计划服务，为社会主义服务，这就是知识分子所应当做的。
    毫无疑问，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大斗争中，知识分子将是一支重要的战斗队伍。但是另一方面，也必须认识，从资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的知识分子，本身都存在着不少缺点。大部分旧知识分子，正如毛主席所指出的，“往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”主观主义和个人主义往往发展成为骄傲自满，自高自大，甚至于自私自利，这样就必然脱离群众，脱离实际，不能接受新事物，这是同社会主义的事业根本不相容的。因此，知识分子要参加建设社会主义的伟大事业，首先就应当认真地进行自我教育与改造。
    我自己也是从旧社会出身的一个知识分子。许多年来，我虽然跟着中国共产党走，受了党的教育，但是我还是有很多缺点的，我的病根还是很深。我时常反问我自己：
    我是不是紧密地靠拢了中国共产党呢？
    我有没有骄傲自满的情绪呢？
    我能不能全心全意地为人民服务、为社会主义服务呢？
    我相信，我们知识分子，必须时刻检查自己，严格要求自己，认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，在革命实践中锻炼自己，进一步教育广大人民，才能使我们自己改造成为新社会的新人，才能对于社会主义伟大事业有所贡献。
    代表同志们！我完全相信，通过五年计划的实施，我们的革命事业一定胜利成功。但在前进的途程中，还必须克服一切的困难和阻力。国内国外的敌人，决不会甘心于失败，他们一定会用千方百计，来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。胡风反革命集团阴谋的揭发，对于我们是一次极深刻的教训。我们必须时刻警惕着，绝不容许在知识分子队伍中间暗藏着反党反人民的坏分子。
    代表同志们！我向大会建议通过第一个五年计划草案，并批准国家决算和预算。让我们大家团结一致，以第一个五年计划作为奋斗的目标和纲领，继续发扬艰苦朴素的革命精神，全心全意，兢兢业业，为完成社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的伟大事业而奋斗到底。
    张奚若部长的发言
    我完全同意中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理关于这个五年计划的报告，我也完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”和邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，我建议大会通过五年计划，批准国家预决算，并通过几个报告。
    第一个五年计划是实现国家过渡时期总任务的带有决定意义的纲领。我们教育工作者应该积极拥护，并站在自己的工作岗位上，勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业地工作，克服各种困难，保证五年计划中的教育建设计划的实现。
    我现在想就普通教育中存在的几个问题讲几句话。
    五年计划规定了普通教育发展的指标，这个指标是根据国家整个经济建设的需要和当前国家人力物力财力的条件规定出来的，是切合实际的。但是有一些人常常提出这样一个问题：政府为什么不多拿一些钱，多开办一些中学和小学，让更多的孩子升学或上学呢？
    我们说，政府对人民教育事业的发展是十分关心的。国家拿出的教育经费并不算少，而是相当多的。普通教育和师范教育的经费，占国家五年计划总支出的百分之五点五四。每年教育经费占整个文化教育卫生经费的一半以上。一九五五年预算中“教育支出”一项的数字，比国民党反动政府统治时期教育支出预算最高年份（一九四六年）多二十八倍。美国一九五二—一九五三年度的社会文教支出预算仅占总预算的百分之三点六，而中国一九五三年的社会文教支出预算却占总预算支出的百分之十四点九。教育经费如再要增加，不但是不可能，也是不应该的。为什么呢？因为社会主义工业化是我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是首先发展重工业。这是社会主义建设的不可动摇的正确方针。如果再增加教育经费，那就势必要削减工业建设的投资，那就要推迟社会主义工业化的进度。这和国家过渡时期的总任务是相违背的，当然是不能允许的。经济建设是国家建设的基础，工业建设又是基础的基础，文教事业应当在也只能在发展生产的基础上来进行。如果削减经济建设的投资来发展文教事业，那就是本末倒置的做法。在苏联，十月革命以后，在相当长的时期内，节省一切开支，包括节省教育经费的开支，集中一切力量，先搞社会主义工业化。我国工业的基础比当时的苏联更差，当然更应该这样做。有些人口头上拥护国家社会主义工业化，但一到自己的孩子不能升学时，却埋怨政府不多办学校，这显然是不对的。事实上，新中国成立以来，我国普通教育事业的发展是很大的。一九五四年，中学学生已达三百五十八万余人，小学学生已达五千一百一十九万余人。同解放初期（一九四九年）相比，中学学生增加了将近两倍半，小学学生增加了一倍多。同一九五二年相比，中学学生增加了百分之四十四，小学经过了整顿，学生也稍有增加。到一九五七年，中学在校学生将达到四百七十万零七千人，小学在校学生将达到六千零二十三万人，即占全国学龄儿童的百分之七十以上。当然，由于人民生活的改善，这还不能完全满足人民的文化要求。但是为了保证重工业的发展，教育经费不可能也不应该再增加了。我想这一点大家已够明白，不必再多说了。不过这还只是这个问题的一面，另一面便是师资问题。师资数量缺乏，质量不高，是一个很严重的问题。全国现有中学教师中约有一半人不够师范专科学校毕业程度，小学教师中也将近一半人不够初级师范学校毕业程度。这种情况的影响是显而易见的。要培养新的师资和提高现有的师资，都需要相当长的时间，不是一时所能为力的。此外，校舍和设备也有困难。因有以上种种情形，国家对中、小学只能采取有重点地、有条件地、有计划地稳步发展的方针。
    当然，我们还是要在可能范围内，尽力想办法来满足人民群众的文化要求，主要是贯彻精简节约、发挥潜力的精神，尽量多办些学校，多收些学生。一方面要发挥学校的潜力，逐步推行二部制，充分发挥学校原有的人力和设备的利用率；合理的建立学校网，做到居民子女能够就近就地上学，减少住宿生，使学校能够招收更多的学生。另一方面要发挥群众的潜力，号召人民群众遵照第一个五年计划的精神，并按照政府提倡群众办学和允许私人办学的方针，积极办学，协助国家发展人民教育事业，以满足自己的文化要求。随着农业生产合作社运动的迅速发展，农民群众对文化的要求日益迫切，他们自办小学的条件也日益具备，同时他们也有办学的传统。因此，对民办小学应根据需要和自愿相结合的原则，采取积极扶植，稳步发展的方针。有些人对民办小学存在着“怕麻烦”、“怕背包袱”、“怕不正规”、“怕办不好”的想法。这是脱离群众、脱离实际的想法，是不对的。目前发展民办小学的一个实际困难，就是经济比较发展的地方，一般都已有了公立小学，而没有公立小学的，正是经济不发展的地方。有人看到这种情形，就说过去的做法是不合理的。我们认为在国家人力、财力有限，不能实施普及教育的时候，首先在人口集中、经济较发达的地方办学，还是合理的。今后对于群众有条件办学而现在已有公立学校的地方，应尽量发展民办小学来满足群众子女入学的要求；在经济不发达的地方，除有重点地逐步地发展公立小学外，也可以酌量发展民办小学。在学校很少的少数民族地区，应当适当地发展公立小学。
    在积极地稳步地发展普通教育的同时，必须注意提高教育质量。过去我们教育行政部门偏重学校数量的发展，忽视了教育质量的提高，这是不符合国家建设对于教育工作的要求的。周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的政府工作报告中强调指出：“中小学教育已有很大的发展，今后应当着重质量的提高”。一年来，各级教育行政部门和中、小学校已经注意到提高教育质量的工作，明确了要根据全面发展的方针来办好学校，教好学生。要提高教育的质量，就必须提高教师和学校领导干部的质量，提高教材的质量。关于前一点，我们决定采用各种在职学习和离职轮训的办法，逐步提高学校领导干部和教师的政治水平和文化业务水平，争取在今后三、五年内将学校领导干部和一般教育行政干部普遍轮训一次，并计划在第二个五年计划期间，把全国小学教师中不够初等师范毕业程度的提高到初等师范学校毕业的水平，把中学教师中不够师范专科毕业程度的提高到师范专科学校毕业的水平。关于后一点，教育部决定在今后三年内积极组织力量，编齐一套较完善的中、小学和师范学校的教学大纲和教科书，并编成一部分教学指导书。
    这里必须提出一点，在提高教育质量的工作中，有些地区和有些学校对提高学生的学习质量方面要求过高过急，并采用了一些不切实际的作法，以致久已存在的学生负担过重的现象更加严重，学生的健康受到很大影响。这种情况已引起社会上广泛的注意和关怀。教育部在这方面是负有责任的，我们应当认真进行检讨，继续设法纠正。
    减轻学生负担的根本办法，是改善教材，提高教师和学校领导干部的水平。但这不是一下子就能完全解决的问题，还必须采取其他及时的有效的办法。半年以来，各地区和各学校已经把减轻学生负担提到工作日程上，初步地想出了一些改进的办法。目前学生负担过重的现象开始有些转变，但这仍然是一个不可忽视的问题。教育部综合各地的经验，最近发出了“关于减轻中、小学学生过重负担的指示”。这一指示的贯彻和实现，还希望各方面予以监督和督促。
    现在已到暑假了。过去两年在暑假期间，为了中、小学毕业生的升学和从事生产劳动的问题，社会上曾经出现过一种紧张的情绪。今年的情况也相当严重。我们必须首先向这些青年学生和他们的家长讲清楚，普通学校教育的任务是培养社会主义社会的自觉的积极的建设者，在今后相当长的时期内，国家对初中和高小毕业生的基本政策，除招考一小部分人升学外，主要是号召、组织一部分人去从事工业生产，大部分人去从事农业生产，积极参加农业生产互助合作运动。但是贯彻这一政策的思想障碍到现在还很严重。一方面是由于我们的宣传解释工作还不够深入，这一正确的政策还没有被每一个人都了解和接受。有些人还不明白为什么初中、高小毕业生不能全部升学的原因，和为什么要动员他们从事生产劳动的积极意义。因此，他们对政府不能多办学校，就多多少少有些不满。我想对于这些人只要我们好好地向他们解释，他们是会积极拥护国家对初中和高小毕业生的基本政策的。另一方面，是由于旧社会轻视劳动的剥削阶级思想的影响遗留很深。过去学校对劳动教育进行得很不够，所以有很多初中和高小毕业生只愿升学、当干部、当专家，不愿从事生产劳动，特别是农业生产劳动。他们认为回农村工作“太苦”、“太脏”、“太丢人”、“没有前途”。青年学生之所以有这种“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”和“学而优则仕”的思想，有这种轻视体力劳动和劳动人民的思想，是由于地主阶级、资产阶级的思想对青年一代的侵蚀。我们必须批判这种有害的思想，用社会主义思想来教育青年，树立热爱劳动、尊重劳动人民的社会舆论和风气。我们希望家在农村的学生，考不取学校就应当回乡村从事农业生产，积极参加农业生产互助合作运动；家在城市的升不了学的学生，我们希望他们的家长能从各方面设法为子女谋得职业。我们也希望不能升学而又暂时不能参加生产或工作的毕业学生，积极参加自学小组，继续补习文化和生产知识，准备将来参加生产劳动。政府对于这些学生的升学和就业问题是非常关心的，也将尽量设法帮助解决。但是某些学生和家长有单纯依赖政府和希望政府完全包下来的想法是不对的，是不实际的，是办不到的。
    新中国的前途是光辉灿烂的，青年一代的前途也是广阔无边的。“一切为了社会主义”。我们欢迎青年同志们愉快地走向祖国各种建设的光荣的岗位上去，我们也希望他们的家长和社会各方面帮助他们走向这些岗位上去。
    叶圣陶代表的发言
    这次会议，一开头就听了李富春副总理关于第一个五年计划的报告。在代表小组里，用绝大部分时间阅读和讨论了第一个五年计划草案。这个计划真是经纬万端，考虑得那末周密，结构得那末适当，阐说的部分又那末深入浅出，使一般人只要肯动脑筋就能够领会。我们并不是向往空想的社会主义的人，我们要实现的是根据马克思列宁主义学说的脚踏实地的社会主义。这个五年计划的目的，扼要一句话，就是为实现社会主义打下巩固的物质基础。以前我们学习，多少知道了一些有关打下物质基础的发展国民经济的道理，例如应该优先发展重工业啦，工业和农业的发展要保持适当的比例啦，重工业和轻工业的发展要保持适当的比例啦，建设计划要跟资金积累的程度相适应啦，等等。现在，这些道理在这个计划里具体化了。换句话说，就是这些道理在这个计划的投资分配方面，生产指标方面，各项工作的先后缓急互相配合方面，具体地表现出来了。这就使大家明白，根据我国的具体情况，参照苏联和人民民主国家的经验，发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划应该这样编制，必须这样编制，这样编制才是理论跟实际结合。大家从这里受到最深刻最具体的马克思列宁主义教育。受了这样的教育，必然会在思想方法上有所提高，必然会在各种工作上发生作用。因此，我首先对拟定和提出这个计划草案的中国共产党中央委员会表示真诚的感激。我跟许多位代表同志一样，建议大会通过这个计划。
    这个计划通过以后，我们必须经常地认真地学习。现在虽然有些领会，那只是初步，还差得远。像这样博大繁密的东西，要是仅仅涉猎一下，不能寝馈其中，决不会学透，但是我们非把它学透不可。我说两点意思。
    一个企业，一个工作机构，在整个计划里，都只担任或大或小或广或窄的一项任务。但是无论哪一项任务都跟整个计划联系在一块儿。用习用的比拟说法说，整个计划好比一台机器，各业各门好比齿轮和螺丝钉，要使机器运转不息，充分发挥它的效率，一个齿轮一个螺丝钉都松不得。我们把五年计划学得越透，就越能体会各种工作之间配合联系的关系确然像这个比拟说法那样。这种体会不仅表现在理解方面，口头说得出，笔下写得出，而且会贯彻在实践方面，因为那时候有一股自觉的精神管住我们，我们非加紧努力不可。既然知道本岗位工作做不好，不但本岗位受到坏影响，连其他一连串工作都要受到坏影响，谁还肯马虎随便地对待本岗位工作？既然知道一个单位甚至一个人的偶尔松懈绝非“小事情”，正像一个单位甚至一个人的偶尔浪费绝非“小事情”一样，就整体看来，都是极其有害的“大事情”，谁还肯把这种极其有害的“大事情”惹在身上？这种自觉的精神正是完成和超额完成五年计划的必要保证之一。
    这就是说，为了加紧努力，我们必须把五年计划学透。
    我们一方面加紧努力，一方面要随时随地提高警惕，因为人民的敌人最不喜欢我们完成五年计划，会派遣一些暗害分子来破坏我们的五年计划。最近看到本月份出版的“经济译丛”，里边有莫洛托夫的一篇“必须从托洛茨基法西斯走狗的暗害破坏和间谍事件中吸取教训”。那篇文章还没登完，但是看登出的部分就知道暗害分子专挑那些关键性的方面下手。例如你给各项建设定下规格，惟有按照规格建设才能顺利地生产，他就想尽办法使它不合规格。又如你要这一项生产跟那一项生产配合，惟有两相配合才收相辅相成的效果，他就想尽办法让两项生产脱节。现在我们要提高警惕，方法当然不止一条两条，我想，把五年计划学透总该是其中的一条。我们把五年计划学透，就大范围说也好，就小范围说也好，准能认清楚关键性的方面在哪儿。关键性的方面不含糊，这是所谓提纲挈领，一般性的方面自然全都了然。这样，不等暗害活动施展出来，只要暗害分子偷偷摸摸正想下第一手，或者在颜色言谈之间才露一些“苗头”，我们就警觉地看出来了。
    这就是说，为了提高警惕，我们也必须把五年计划学透。
    舒同代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，以及李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是以工业为主体的，他的首要任务就是集中主要力量发展工业尤其优先发展重工业。但同时并不减轻对于发展农业的重要意义。因为发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。从这个前提出发并结合着山东地区的实际情况，我们认为在山东贯彻执行第一个五年计划的重要关键就是大力开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，积极发展农业生产，以争取多打粮食，多产棉花及其他经济作物和油料作物来支援国家的重点建设和满足本地人民的生活需要。
    山东是一个地少人多的省份，全省耕地面积为一亿三千九百余万亩，每人平均只有两亩多一点土地，播种面积为二亿零五千多万亩，其中棉、麻、烟、花生等经济作物和油料作物播种面积占二千余万亩，而可垦的荒地仅有三、四百万亩，且多系沿海碱地。因此有人根据这种情况，认为山东农业生产发展前途不大，并认为山东是“缺粮户”，从来依靠外援，或者以为争取粮食自给，就要减少经济作物的播种面积。
    当然我们不能减少经济作物的种植面积，也不应该在粮食问题上依靠国家援助，因为这样就会影响整个国家工业建设和人民生活需要，我们不仅要看到山东地少人多这个特点，特别还要看到它的富有的生产潜力。我们的责任就在于充分地发掘这一方面的潜力，以达到既能保证完成国家分配的经济作物的增产任务，又能保证完成粮食的生产，除了遭受不可抗拒的自然灾害外，一般年景不仅可以自给，而且还可节余粮食支援国家建设。发展农业生产的主要途径就是依靠合作化及其他各种有效措施，来提高单位面积产量。
    合作化是农业增产的基础。按照一般情况，合作社比单干农民每亩地约可增产粮食十斤到二十斤。目前山东全省有九万个合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之十九，计划到一九五七年将达到十四万个社，甚至更多一点，入社农户将占总农户数的百分之五十以上，这对农业生产的发展必然起着重大的作用，目前山东秋粮种植面积最大的是大豆、高粱，而这些都是低产作物，大豆常年产量每亩百斤左右，高粱每亩产量一百五十斤左右，而如果改种高产作物收获就大可增加，比如种地瓜每亩可收一千五百斤，玉米每亩可收一百七十斤左右，稻子每亩收二、三百斤，我们计划到一九五七年增种这类高产作物一千万亩左右，其中增种地瓜四百万亩，即可增产六、七十亿斤，把旱地变为水地一般每亩可增产一百斤左右，单就打井灌溉来说，我们计划在今后三年内打井十五万余眼，贷放水车八万余部，这样就可扩大水浇地到一千多万亩。此外，普及优良品种，推广新式农具，改进耕作技术等等都是行之有效的增产办法，我们准备大力推行。
    几年来山东粮食生产的实际情况也说明山东粮食在正常的年景不仅可以做到自给，而且还有节余来支援国家。例如：一九五二年这是比较好的年景，这一年山东产粮二百五十一亿斤，除调出调入两者相抵外，净调出三亿七千余万斤。一九五三年是灾情较重的年景，这一年山东的粮食产量是二百二十一亿斤，除调出调入两者相抵外，净调入七亿九千余万斤。但根据一九五四年六月底库存情况（十八亿斤），少调入一些也还是可以的。一九五四年是丰收的年景，这一年山东粮食总产量是二百六十四亿斤，除调出调入相抵外，净调出九亿八千余万斤，而这几年山东的经济作物播种面积都是逐年增长的。
    认为山东农业生产的发展没有前途，山东是“缺粮户”的说法不仅没有根据，而且是非常有害的。这是由于对山东农业生产的潜力估计不足，以及地方主义、本位主义在作怪，因而特别强调本地区的特殊和困难，只顾本位利益，不顾整体利益，这与实现国家的计划经济建设是不能相容的。
    我们根据第一个五年计划的基本精神及山东的实际情况，把发展农业生产作为山东工作的重点，使之既有利于国家的工业建设，又能满足山东地区的人民需要，这并不是说山东地区的工业生产就可以被忽视了。不是的，搞好山东地区的工业生产，仍然是我们的一个重要任务。经过几年来的恢复和发展，一九五四年山东工业的产值在工农业总产值中所占比重已由一九四九年的百分之二十点九上升到百分之三十七点三六。但另一方面，由于我们工作上的一些缺点，加上山东原有工业设备能力较大，以致地方工业的设备利用率还很低，产品质量不好，成本又高。因之必须根据当前国防和经济建设的需要，在全国供、产、销平衡的基础上，充分利用现有设备能力，增加生产，提高质量，降低成本，试制新的品种并使之密切的为农业生产服务。
    胜利地实现第一个五年计划，将使我国的工业和全部国民经济有巨大的发展，“将使我们在实现过渡时期总任务的道路上得到一个具有决定意义的胜利”，全国人民必将鼓起更大的勇气，团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的周围，为第一个五年计划的彻底实现而奋斗！我们山东地区的政府机关和党组织与全省人民一定和全国人民一道，兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约；并不断改善领导，转变作风，尽一切努力完成和超额完成国家给予本地方的这一份光荣而艰巨的任务！
    张祺代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢等副总理、彭真副委员长的各项报告。
    第一个五年计划，是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民，把我国建设成为一个繁荣幸福的社会主义国家的第一个计划。它的全部实现，将给我们和我们的子孙后代奠定无限的幸福生活的物质基础。这是完全符合全国人民包括上海广大职工群众和劳动人民的愿望的。
    第一个五年计划规定，五年内将要增加的工业总产值中约有百分之七十要从现有企业来完成。上海是我国现有的重要工业基地之一，所以上海工人对于实现五年计划是担负着光荣的任务的。我们要充分地发挥原有企业的潜在力量，完成增加生产，厉行节约和提高劳动生产率的任务；要不断提高技术水平，完成大量的新产品的试制和生产的任务；还要努力培养技术工人和干部，输送他们到内地去支援祖国的建设。
    在过去的两年多中，上海工人完成和超额完成了国家所交给自己的任务。一九五三年，我们不但保证了五年计划第一个年度计划的完成，还给国家增产节约了一亿多元的财富。一九五四年，全市国营、合作社营和公私合营工业所达到的劳动生产率比一九五三年又增长了百分之十五强；第一机械工业部所属的在上海的工厂，一九五四年完成全年生产总值计划百分之一百零七点零八。在全国工人和全国人民的鼓舞下，上海工人有充分的信心来保证完成和争取超额完成自己在第一个五年计划中所担负的光荣任务。
    上海工人今后的任务就是要贯彻兢兢业业、克服困难、增加生产、厉行节约的方针，更广泛、更深入地开展劳动竞赛，发挥自己高度的积极性和创造性，不断地改进技术，提高技术，学习和掌握新技术，积极支持广大职工群众的合理化建议，大力推广先进经验特别是苏联的先进经验，来保证第一个五年计划后三年任务的胜利完成。
    上海国营和公私合营工厂企业中的职工，要努力完成国家计划中的品种计划和新产品的试制计划。过去二年多，我们已经试制了不少新产品，例如，试制成功了六千瓩整套汽轮机的设备和一百吨行车，还有一些新式的机床。但是，去年我们没有完成产品品种计划，主要原因是我们缺乏经验，图纸设计得不够正确，原材料不合技术标准，工人操作不熟练。因此，我们必须在这方面加强一系列的工作，要注意总结工作中的点滴经验，和学习其他各地的先进经验，克服新产品试制工作中的薄弱环节，保证给国家制造出更多、更好、更便宜的完全合乎国家规格的新机器和其他新的产品，来满足新建、扩建和改建厂矿的需要。
    为了给国家增加生产，积累资金并更多地满足人民的生活需要，我们就必须节约地使用原料，使同样数量的原料能出产更多一些的工业产品。在公私营棉纺织厂中，虽然由于发挥了职工群众的智慧，推广了先进的节约用棉经验，每件纱的平均用棉量已降低到三百八十六点一市斤，比计划降低将近七市斤；但仍然有些纺织工厂对原棉的节约还是注意不够的。我们今后还要努力，普遍在全市棉纺织厂中推广先进企业的经验，继续在保证质量的基础上厉行原棉的节约。在机械工业中，许多产品质量低劣因而报废，原材料的浪费随便丢弃的现象，还是很严重的。有的工人很心痛地说：“遍地是黄金”。因此，我们必须厉行全面节约，从各方面来消灭浪费。
    在社会主义工业化建设中，科学技术人材的缺乏是一个严重的困难，为了适应国家建设中技术人材的需要，上海工人就应该为国家培养、训练和输送大批技术人员或熟练工人到国家建设所需要的地方去。这是一个光荣的责任。上海是较老的工业基地，各种建设所需要的技术人材及熟练工人是比较多的，我们应充分利用和发挥这个条件；技术人员和老师傅要把自己的科学知识和技术又快又好地教会新工人，老师傅要负责“包教包会”，带好徒弟；同时也要组织和教育新工人虚心地学习文化和技术，并不断提高社会主义觉悟。四年多来，上海动员到内地参加重点建设的技术工人、技术人员、经济工作干部共有七万多人，一九五四年下半年到今年三月动员参加重点建设的技工有五千五百人。他们愉快地离开家庭，改变原来的生活习惯，一般地讲是好的；但也有少数人，因为生活不习惯，不安心工作，有的骄傲自满，闹福利待遇，不主动地与当地工人搞好团结，这些都说明我们工作中还有不少缺点。今后为了更多地动员工人参加重点建设，必须经常加强对广大职工群众进行艰苦奋斗、克服困难的思想教育，以便时刻准备着听候国家的调遣，踊跃地参加到支援重点建设所需要的岗位上去。
    上海又是资本主义企业很集中的城市，为了配合国家对资本主义企业进行社会主义改造的工作，上海资本主义企业中的职工和工会组织，还要监督和协助资本家接受改造，并在改造企业的同时改造他们个人。一方面要监督他们切实地遵守国家的法律和法令，严防他们的各种不法活动；要反对资本家腐蚀职工和分化职工的团结或过分剥削，如个别资本家所进行的“拉拢派员，腐蚀工会干部，孤立支部书记”，挑拨党、行政、工会组织的关系。对这种不法行为，必须给以应得的处分。另一方面，要推动资本家积极地改善生产管理工作，改革各项不合理的制度，以发挥私营企业的潜在力量。至于资本家本人，能积极深入生产实际，按国家法令老老实实地经营企业，并愿意接受改造的，我们工会组织也要积极地帮助其改造，鼓励其进步。
    在私营企业中的职工，同时也应该厉行节约，搞好生产，一方面有责任积极地保证按质、按量、按时地完成国家加工定货的任务；另一方面也有责任加强监督，协助政府防止不法资本家偷工减料、贪图暴利、提高工费等不法行为。
    随着我国社会主义工业化建设事业的进展，阶级斗争必然会日益尖锐起来。最近揭露的潘汉年、胡风两个重大反革命案件，证明敌人不惜用一切阴谋手段混进革命阵营内部，甚至长期隐藏在我们党内来破坏我们的革命事业。我们必须从潘汉年、胡风两案件中取得教训，时刻提高警惕，纯洁我们的队伍，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    实现五年计划，是一个艰巨的斗争，我们上海市的各级工会组织，应该进一步改善自己的领导作风，加强自己同群众的联系，动员广大职工群众，以国家主人翁的态度，和全国人民一起，为实现我国第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    靳树梁代表的发言
    我完全同意中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理兼国家计划委员会主任关于第一个五年计划的报告。我完全同意一九五四年国家决算、一九五五年国家预算和李先念副总理兼财政部长关于国家决算和预算的报告。我也完全同意彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告和彭真副委员长兼秘书长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我认为第一个五年计划草案是我国当前可能有的最完善的计划。理由是：第一，第一个五年计划完全符合中华人民共和国宪法的精神；正确地体现了过渡时期党的总路线和中国人民的总任务；适当地规划了国家的社会主义工业化的规模；并且适当地安排了对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的实施步骤，保证了社会主义经济力量的稳步增长。第二，第一个五年计划适合高速度发展经济的要求，同时又是切实可行的。高速度表现在作为重点的工业发展上，特别是重工业的发展上。五年内工业总产值增长近一倍，其中钢的产值增长两倍以上，任何资本主义国家发展工业不可能有这样高的速度。其所以切实可行，表现在对于资金、资源、技术力量等客观条件都作了正确的估计。计划中保留着的个别的、次要的资源情况在建设的同时也都予以摸清，并且逐步地在建设的同时学会本领，这正足以表现计划的先进性。第三，第一个五年计划是以发展重工业为中心的，而在发展重工业的同时，又全面地、适当地兼顾着轻工业、农业、交通运输业、商业等方面的发展。为了保证国民经济不断地高速度地发展，集中力量发展重工业是完全必要的。为了保证国民经济按比例地发展，适当地兼顾各个经济部门的发展也是完全必要的。
    根据以上理由，我认为第一个五年计划草案，是根据全国人民的需要适当地估计了一切可能动员的人力、物力、财力等客观条件而制定的，所以是最完善的。
    第一个五年计划的胜利完成，将要改变我国国民经济的面貌，特别是工业的面貌。全国人民以至全世界爱好和平的人民都将为之欢欣鼓舞。我个人曾经从事钢铁工业的工作，比较习惯于从钢铁工业的角度来观察整个工业的面貌，因此对于第一个五年计划，格外感到亲切，格外掩不住内心的愉快和兴奋。
    繁荣富强的中国已经在望，眼前的第一个五年计划，每个数目字都放射着灿烂光芒。眼前越光明越愉快，就越容易回忆起过去的暗淡和苦痛。
    在旧中国，我曾经看到，我曾在其中实习过的汉阳钢铁厂，被日本帝国主义用放款和监督财务的手段紧紧地束缚住，使它长时期地不能生产钢铁而只能采铁矿以供日本帝国主义利用。我又曾看到我所工作过的附设有炼铁厂的汉口扬子机器制造公司，在军阀混战的局面下不能自存，终于被日本帝国主义用抵押放款的方式，夺取了它的全部机器设备，并将其拆除运走。
    汉阳钢铁厂的兴建，和日本第一个大钢铁厂——八幡制铁所的兴建在同一时期，而其结果，是汉阳钢铁厂在日本发展成了帝国主义之后，遭受到了它的压迫和掠夺。这一事实的演变，固然有政治上、经济上、国防上各种原因，但是它证明了一件事，就是：在汉阳钢铁厂失败的当时，我国工业化要想走资本主义的老路，早已是此路不通了。也就是说，在那时以后，我国工业化就只有社会主义的一条道路可走了。
    毛主席在“论联合政府”一书中说：“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业”，指出了这个问题的本质。
    第一个五年计划不是容易得来的。中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，经过了长期流血斗争，才有了今天的中国，才有了今天的第一个五年计划。
    感谢苏联和各兄弟国家给与我们的帮助，特别是苏联的帮助。苏联帮助我们设计的一百五十六项工程是第一个五年计划的中心设施。在培养建设人材方面，苏联也给了我们巨大的帮助。
    作为一个高等工业学校的工作人员，我深深体会到培养建设人材这一任务的光荣和艰巨。
    东北工学院是全国四十二所高等工业学校之一。五年来为国家输送了三千四百四十一名技术干部。教师们都参加了本市马列主义业余大学的学习，理论水平逐渐提高了，资产阶级思想受到了批判，对于学习苏联先进经验日益努力。同时由于教学改革的推行，教学质量虽然还远赶不上客观形势的要求，但是年年都有一定的提高。教学上负担过重的情况，自经高等教育部指出后，采取了积极措施，初步地得到了纠正，但学生的健康情况，仍然是我们今后必须密切注意的一个问题。
    东北工学院所在地的沈阳是一个工业城市，又和鞍山、本溪、抚顺等城市相距很近，在联系生产厂矿方面有便利的条件。为了更密切地相互联系以提高教学质量和便利科学研究，东北工学院和鞍钢等四十个厂矿订有联系合同，并且初步地开展了科学研究工作，召开了一次科学讨论会，宣读了五十二篇论文。
    我们的工作还远远落后于五年计划的要求，特别是我个人的知识经验十分不够，今后一定要遵照毛主席的指示：“老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”，并且全面地系统地学习苏联先进经验，推进教学改革，提高教学质量。我们一定要在共产党和人民政府正确领导下，克服一切困难，克服工作中的缺点和错误，为了胜利实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    华侨事务委员会主任何香凝的发言
    我热诚拥护李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告。
    第一个五年计划，充分反映了我国人民建设社会主义的普遍要求和共同愿望，是个规模大、速度快、宏伟而切实可行的计划。通过这一计划的实施，我们国家就能为社会主义工业化建立初步的基础，人民的物质和文化生活就能逐渐改善和提高。对于这个伟大正确的计划和其他三个报告，我们应该坚决贯彻执行。
    必须指出，随着第一个五年计划的完成，我国的国民经济将大大发展，工业力量将打下初步的稳固基础，国防力量将更为加强，这就使美帝国主义好战集团在亚洲发动战争的侵略阴谋更难得逞，亚洲和世界和平更有保障，因此美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团必然十分畏惧和仇视我国五年计划的建设事业，必然派遣特务间谍分子对我们进行各种反革命的罪恶活动。最近破获的胡风反革命集团及潘汉年的反革命罪行的事件就是一个铁证。为了完成五年计划，必须毫不留情地坚决镇压和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，对罪大恶极的反革命罪魁要依法严惩，这是谁也不能丝毫怀疑的。国外华侨深受美帝国主义和蒋贼特务的毒害，对反革命分子有着深刻的认识和仇恨，祖国政府镇压反革命的坚决措施，华侨是积极支持和拥护的。
    国外广大华侨，由于受到帝国主义的排挤和迫害，处境是困难的。蒋贼分子猖獗的卖国祸侨活动，更增加华侨的苦难。祖国的建设成就，外交胜利和国防力量的大大增强，都给国外华侨以极大的鼓舞。祖国的第一个五年计划，将迅速引导祖国更加繁荣富强，完全符合华侨的长远利益和根本利益，符合他们对祖国的热切愿望。
    为了将我国建成一个繁荣幸福的社会主义国家，我们要努力保卫和平，并为争取持久的和平而奋斗。我政府的和平外交方针，明确表达了中国人民爱好和平的意志。我国的侨务政策一向遵从着这一和平外交的基本方针，符合于为建立和增进我国与华侨侨居国的友好关系的政策。今年四月二十二日，我政府和印度尼西亚共和国政府，根据平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则，在友好合作和互相谅解的基础上，签订了关于解决双重国籍问题的条约，六月间又就条约问题互换了照会。在条约和照会中充分体现了我国真诚地同印度尼西亚共和国在友好与合作的基础上，通过协商的途径，解决复杂的双重国籍问题，以增进两国友好关系的诚恳愿望，并具体地表现了我国保护华侨正当权利和利益与不干涉他国内政的一贯政策。这一问题的解决，不仅符合华侨的要求和切身利益，获得了华侨普遍的欢迎和热烈的支持，而且是两国友好合作关系进一步发展的重要标志。这是以友好协商的方法，解决国际间繁难问题的一个良好范例。这一问题的解决有力地打击了帝国主义借华侨国籍问题进行造谣挑拨的阴谋，对于进一步改善我国和东南亚各国的关系，促进亚洲和世界的和平，也是一个重要的贡献。
    国外华侨对祖国的热烈拥护，尤其在周总理访问缅甸、印度尼西亚时，表现得最为明显。华侨在祖国日趋强固兴盛的鼓舞之下，一年来的互助互济和文化福利事业，有了进一步的开展，爱国情绪更加提高，团结面更加扩大。华侨与侨居国人民的友谊，也有了进一步的增进。但是这些都还是不够的，还应该进一步加强华侨本身的团结，做好华侨本身的福利工作，并应为粉碎蒋贼分子害侨祸侨的阴谋作更多的努力。
    几年来国内侨务工作在密切结合政府各个时期的中心任务下，照顾到华侨侨眷的特殊情况，解决了侨眷、归侨的一些实际问题，因此达到了团结国外广大华侨，并使侨眷、归侨在参加各项运动中，不断提高爱国热情，积极参加国家社会主义建设的目的。近一年中，国内侨务方面的重要任务之一，是贯彻保护侨汇的政策。国务院在今年二月颁布了“关于贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令”，这一命令明确规定，国家保护侨汇不仅是当前的政策，而且是长远的政策，任何人不得侵犯侨汇与干涉侨眷使用侨汇的自由。违法者应分别情况，依法论处。根据这一命令，各主要侨眷聚居地区的行政机关，都已先后采取了贯彻侨汇政策的具体措施，因而进一步密切了华侨与祖国的联系，全国侨汇亦逐渐上升。但是目前各地贯彻侨汇政策的情况还不平衡，对基层干部与群众反复交代政策，仍感不足。希望今后侨眷居住区的各级政府在进行各项中心工作时，仍能注意继续贯彻这一政策，各级侨务工作部门也应以此为中心，结合国家各项工作贯彻侨务政策。在向各级干部交代政策时，必须使他们正确认识侨眷依靠侨汇生活是历史造成的，大部分华侨家庭的主要劳动力在国外，留在国内的眷属，劳动力较弱，加以侨区原来就地少人多，因而在相当长的时间内，侨汇仍将成为侨眷不可缺少的一项生活来源，所以任何歧视侨眷依靠侨汇生活，就是忽视近千万群众的切身利益。同时，为了华侨、侨眷的长远利益，我们除了保护侨汇外，仍应照顾侨眷的特点，加强对侨眷的社会主义思想教育，并严格遵守自愿原则，逐步引导侨眷参加祖国社会主义建设的各项生产工作，如参加农业生产，参加山林荒地的开发，参加手工业与副业生产等，并逐步引导他们参加生产合作社、信用合作社，这对于国家和广大华侨、侨眷都是有利的。
    在伟大的五年计划的号召下，华侨回国投资参加社会主义建设将日趋积极，根据华侨在国外的特殊情况，广东、福建均分别制定了华侨投资办法，并加强具体辅导工作，引导他们投资于地方工业与农林畜牧生产，这是有积极意义的。侨委今后将加强这一工作的指导，同时希望各有关部门与有关方面，也支持、指导侨务机关，并和侨务机关一起来推进这一工作，借以充分发扬华侨的爱国主义精神，增加国家生产建设资金。
    为了保证人民生活和国家建设的需要，消灭粮食投机，稳定物价，进一步巩固工农联盟，国家对粮食采取统购统销的政策，是实现国家过渡时期总路线的重要措施之一。自实行统购统销以来的事实已经证明，这一政策是为全国人民热烈拥护的。
    今年四月以来，曾有一些华侨侨眷反映口粮不够。据此次下乡视察的华侨代表了解，去冬广东、福建部分地区遭受冻灾，杂粮失收，今春又受旱灾威胁，加以在统销过程中曾发生过先松后紧等现象，而华侨事务委员会又未能根据侨眷依靠侨汇、土地少、杂粮少的特点，及时提出对各地侨眷所必要的照顾办法，致使个别侨区一度发生过粮食紧张的情况。但中央和地方随即采取了紧急措施，进行纠正补救，现在情况已经好转。鉴于统购统销是社会主义建设所不可缺少的一个环节，今后我们还应在华侨侨眷中加强宣传教育工作，要他们真正懂得并坚决拥护国家的粮食统购统销政策，并随时警惕，防止敌人的造谣破坏。惟希望地方国家机关在切实监督干部做好“三定”工作中，对于侨眷的婚、丧、喜、庆用粮，在节约的精神下，给予适当的照顾，这仍是必要的。
    今后我们的工作，在国外方面将根据我国的和平外交政策，贯彻我国和印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题的条约，团结华侨互助互济，继续增进同侨居国人民的友好关系，加强对蒋贼分子的祸侨害侨的斗争，团结广大侨胞热爱祖国。在国内方面，继续贯彻国务院保护侨汇的政策，从而逐步地耐心地引导侨眷、归侨参加农业、畜牧业及副业生产，做好对华侨投资参加社会主义建设的辅导工作，同时逐步解决归侨就业和归国华侨学生就学问题。
    各位代表，华侨是热爱祖国的。国外华侨因为处境不同，不能同祖国人民一道亲自参加社会主义建设，蒋贼分子又欺诈他们，帝国主义反动集团又仇视和排斥他们。由于他们处在这样的复杂情况之下，而国内的各项措施又和他们息息相关，这就使侨务工作显得更为复杂，牵涉的方面很广。因此我恳切地热望各位代表和各有关部门多多给我们以帮助和指导，特别是侨眷居住地区的地方人民委员会，更望能经常加强对侨务工作的领导，使国家的侨务政策真正能为广大干部和群众所掌握，这对于团结广大华侨和侨眷积极参加国家的社会主义建设事业是十分必要的。
