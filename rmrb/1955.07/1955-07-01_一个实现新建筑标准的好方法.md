　　A Good Way to Implement New Building Standards
　　Wang Pu
　　The responsible comrades of the Datong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the personnel of the Datong Municipal Construction Engineering Company recently investigated the living conditions and construction costs of different types of residences of citizens and suburban farmers in Datong City. After the investigation, they convened various construction units to study the matter and instructed them to formulate standard designs that were cheap and suitable, with reference to the structure of some civilian houses.
　　The results of their investigation revealed that many houses were both cheap and suitable. One bungalow had a rubble foundation, adobe walls, whitewashed roof, and glass windows, with the interior plastered with whitewash. This type of house could last for thirty years, and the cost was only twelve yuan per square meter. An old tile craftsman said to the investigators, "Compared to the Datong Coal Mine staff dormitory, it may not be as expensive or as beautiful, but in terms of comfort and warmth, it is no worse!" Another building was a cave-style house, slightly better than the one mentioned above, with more attention to detail in all aspects, but the cost was only twenty-one yuan per square meter. Then there were some buildings in Datong City with tiled roofs, stone foundations, adobe walls with brick corners, plastered interiors, square-tiled floors, and glass doors and windows. The style was also attractive, and people lived comfortably inside. The cost was one-third cheaper than the common flat dormitory of the Datong Coal Mine, which did not have running water or heating.
　　Generally speaking, the above three types of civilian houses are in line with the current living standards of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and they also demonstrate the advantages of folk architecture in our country. The low cost of these houses is mainly due to the use of local materials such as stone, adobe, and whitewash, in addition to the simple structure. Throughout the country, people in different regions have different construction methods, but their characteristics show that they are good at building houses according to different terrains, different climates, different local materials, different living conditions, different economic situations, and different uses. Therefore, the houses built are mostly material-saving, comfortable, convenient, quickly built, and inexpensive.
　　These facts prove that, according to the regulations of the Party Central Committee, it is completely appropriate and possible to lower the standards and costs of non-productive construction. However, it is not an easy task to truly implement the central government's regulations. This requires a lot of work from the basic construction units and design institutions. For example, many of our architects can calculate the load and lifespan of cement, steel, and red bricks, but are unfamiliar with local materials such as adobe, whitewash, bamboo, sorghum stalks, and reed mats. They are also unfamiliar with the climate and living habits of different regions. It is difficult to design without knowing these things. In order to overcome these difficulties, construction units and design institutions should learn from the practices of the Datong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, conduct more investigations and research, and consult with folk construction craftsmen, studying and summarizing their experience of "adapting to local conditions," "adapting to people's needs," and "adapting to local materials." These things cannot be learned in schools or offices. Only by learning it can we build houses that suit the habits of the masses and are comfortable to live in with very little money.

　　一个实现新建筑标准的好方法
　　王朴
    中共大同市委会负责同志和大同市建筑工程公司的人员，最近分别调查了大同市市民和郊区农民不同类型的住宅的居住条件和建筑造价。调查之后，召集了各建筑单位加以研究，并责成各建筑单位参考某些民房的构造，制定便宜而又适用的标准设计。
    他们调查的结果，发现许多房屋既便宜、又适用。有一座平房是片石基础、土坯墙、白灰顶、玻璃窗、房内抹白灰，这种房子可住三十年，每平方公尺造价才十二元。一个老瓦匠对调查的人说：“拿这房子和大同煤矿职工宿舍比，论花钱多、样式漂亮是比不上，可是论住起来舒服和暖和并不比它差！”另一座建筑是窑洞式的房屋，虽比上面那座好一些、各方面也讲究一些，每平方公尺只不过二十一元；再就是大同市内的一些建筑，瓦顶、石头基础、土坯墙包砖角、房内抹灰、方砖漫地、玻璃门窗、式样也好看，人住在里面很舒服的，其造价比大同煤矿没有自来水和暖气的普遍平房宿舍便宜三分之一。
    上述三种类型的民房，一般的说来，是和我国广大人民目前的生活水平相适应的，同样也表明了我国民间建筑的优点。这些房屋的造价低，除了结构简单而外，主要的是采用了石头、土坯、白灰等地方材料。在全国范围内，不同地区的人民虽有不同的建筑方法，但就其特点看都是善于根据不同地形、不同的气候、不同的地方材料、不同的生活条件、不同的经济状况、不同的用途等条件盖房子，因而盖出的房子大都是用料节省、舒适方便、建筑速度很快、价钱便宜。
    这些事实证明，根据党中央的规定，降低非生产性建筑的标准和造价，是完全应该的，也是可能的。不过，想要切实贯彻中央的规定，也不是一件容易的事情。这就需要各基本建设单位和设计机关做很多工作。例如，我们不少的建筑师，可以计算出水泥、钢筋、红砖的荷重和寿命，而对于泥坯、白灰、竹子、秫秸、苇箔等地方材料却不熟悉，对不同地区的气候、生活习惯也很陌生，不熟悉这些东西是很难进行设计的。为了克服这些困难，各建筑单位和设计机关，要学习中共大同市委的做法，多作调查研究，向民间的建筑匠人请教，研究和总结他们“因地制宜”“因人制宜”“因材制宜”的经验；这些东西都是在学校里、机关里学不到的，只有学会它才能用很少的钱盖出适合群众习惯、住起来又很舒适的房子。
