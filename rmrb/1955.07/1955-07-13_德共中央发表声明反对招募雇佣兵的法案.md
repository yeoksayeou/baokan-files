Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th: According to the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement opposing the West German government's law on recruiting mercenaries. The West German government is forcing the parliament to quickly pass this law.

The statement pointed out: The purpose of the law on recruiting mercenaries is to hinder Germany's reunification and is directly aimed at all efforts to strive for the relaxation of international tensions. The statement demands that everyone who opposes the division of Germany reject the Paris Agreement and the law on recruiting mercenaries, and welcomes the demands of many Social Democratic workers to refuse cooperation with the ruling parties on military laws and to launch a united struggle of the working class and all peace-loving people outside of parliament.

The statement finally emphasized: As long as the West German working class acts in unison, it will have the power to thwart the plans of the West German militarists together with other patriots.
