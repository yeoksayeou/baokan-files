　　Shandong Starts Training Rural Work Teams
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to draw 10,000 staff members from provincial, prefectural, and county-level agencies to form rural work teams to strengthen the leadership of the existing 90,000-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shandong Province. Of these 10,000 staff members, 15 percent are from the county level, 65 percent are from the district level, and 20 percent are general staff. The first group of 6,000 staff members, who are scheduled to go to the countryside in mid-July, have been undergoing intensive training at various Party schools since June 16. The second group of 4,000 staff members will also go to the countryside after intensive training by the end of September. Comrades who have decided to go to work in the countryside have made long-term ideological preparations, and many comrades have expressed their determination to work hard to realize rural collectivization.
