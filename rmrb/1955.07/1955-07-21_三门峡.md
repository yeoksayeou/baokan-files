A great plan to change the natural appearance of the Yellow River has been announced!

In 1950, at the International Flood Control Conference held in India, bourgeois scholars pessimistically predicted that the Yellow River was unconquerable, and that even the North China Plain might turn into a desert in a few thousand years. We, however, are going to turn the Yellow River clear within a few decades, turn the arid and windy Northwest Loess Plateau into green land, turn the rushing torrents in the mountains that have been flowing wildly for thousands of kilometers into a ladder composed of forty-six large and small lakes, and turn the scourge that has been flooding the Chinese plains for thousands of years into a source of happy life. In a word: fundamentally reverse the history of the Yellow River.

To make the Yellow River clear! This statement, like "the sun rising from the west," has been used since ancient times to describe something absolutely impossible. Since the legendary Yu the Great, the Chinese people have been fighting stubbornly against the floods of the Yellow River for generations. Judging from the 1,800-kilometer-long Yellow River embankment alone, our water conservancy was already advanced in ancient times. But to make the Yellow River clear was something that no one dared to even think about.

But we not only dare to think, but we are also going to do it.

The construction of the Sanmenxia Hydro Junction is the first step in conquering the Yellow River.

This step involves building a concrete dam like a mountain at the Sanmen Gorge, blocking the Yellow River in the middle and turning it into the largest artificial lake in our country. This lake can hold more than two-thirds of the Yellow River's water, allowing it to clarify here and slowly flow downstream, turning the sudden floods into a steady flow of water, preventing it from flooding and causing disasters, and also providing us with irrigation, electricity, and transportation. This step is equally exciting.

For a month, I traveled three thousand kilometers back and forth along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River with a comprehensive survey team, and I have been deeply moved by this feeling. This survey team is composed of Soviet experts who are responsible for the design of Sanmenxia and our country's experts. The people who once conquered the Volga-Don Canal are now helping us conquer the Yellow River.

Sanmenxia is located between Tongguan and the Mangshan Mountains near Luoyang. This is the last section of the canyon area before the Yellow River flows into the North China Plain. Sanmenxia is the most dangerous mountain gorge among them: the banks are steep and hard, only two hundred and fifty meters apart. Two stone islands stand side by side at the entrance, and three stone islands hold back the rapids at the exit. Two rocky peninsulas protrude from the banks in the middle, tightly clamping the rapids, leaving only a small gap of one hundred and twenty meters wide. We climbed to the high mountains and looked down at the river valley. Sanmenxia is actually a whole piece of rock lying across the river. It's just that a gap has been washed away by the rapids over the years, as if it were split with a giant axe. The small islands in the mountain gorge are simply traces of chaotic axe strokes. The river flows wide and turbulent from afar, becoming more and more rapid as it goes east. Suddenly, it is met head-on by the steep cliffs on the north bank, and the whole river suddenly turns sharply south. Just as it is about to plunge straight down the mountain gorge, it is suddenly split head-on by two stone islands, splitting into three thrilling rapids between the mountain gorges. These three rapids rush out simultaneously from that small gap, only to shake the entire valley with a thunderous sound. Since ancient times, it has been called the Sanmen Heavenly Barrier, and these three waterways are called "Human Gate," "God Gate," and "Ghost Gate," meaning they are very dangerous. Except for the "Human Gate River" on the left bank, which can barely be navigated, only gods and ghosts can pass through the God Gate River in the middle and the Ghost Gate River on the right bank.

In the middle of the mountain gorge, there is a very small stone island, just poking its tip out of the water. It looks like it is about to be swallowed and washed away, but it has been standing in the rapids for thousands of years. This is the famous "Midstream Pillar," also known as the "Pillar Stone," which has been a symbol of our national character since ancient times.

Legend has it that Yu the Great opened the Dragon Gate and the Pillar Stone, meaning that Sanmenxia was artificially opened. Two lines praising Yu the Great's achievements are engraved on the cliff: "Steep cliffs and majestic currents, the work of ghosts and gods."

In fact, this legend not only reflects people's desire to open up the Sanmen Heavenly Barrier, but also reflects the fundamental idea of river management for thousands of years: dredging the river channel. From Sanmenxia, we can also see how people have fought with the Yellow River.

There is an artificial channel carved through the rock on the north bank, called the "Kaiyuan New River." The people call it the "Empress River" or the "Princess River," meaning it was used to transport grain for the imperial family. This was a project during the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty more than a thousand years ago, three hundred meters long, running parallel to the original three waterways, cutting the entire rocky peninsula along the bank. It still looks so neat and straight now. This is a very hard igneous rock. Soviet experts are very interested in this ancient project, because at that time, there was no gunpowder in the world. To carve a canal out of this hardest rock requires the greatest courage and extremely tenacious labor.

Until the completion of the Longhai Railway, Sanmenxia was the traffic artery between the Northwest and Southeast provinces. Especially during the Western Han and Sui-Tang Dynasties, a large amount of grain was transported from Shandong and the Jianghuai River basin along the waterway, passing through here and transporting it to the ancient capital of Chang'an, reaching as much as four million shi at most. However, Sanmenxia had rapid currents, many islands, reefs, and a cliff that plunged down twenty-eight meters under the water. It was even more difficult to sail against the current. In the most serious cases, grain ship losses reached seventy or eighty percent. Therefore, the Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties all carried out large-scale dredging of the river channel. The emperors also personally inspected the site. But all three times failed. The Kaiyuan Canal was also a project to open up the Sanmen Heavenly Barrier. However, this waterway was too shallow for ships to pass through, and too deep to be navigable due to the rapid currents. In the end it was not successful.

So they built grain transport trestle roads, pulling cables across Sanmen from the trestle roads. Now, on some of the stone walls, you can still see rows of deeply chiseled square holes. The wooden stakes of the trestle road were wedged into the cut wall from the square holes. Especially on the right bank of the Human Gate River, there are traces of two trestle roads on the hundred-meter-long steep cliff: one above and one below, both close to the place where the rapids directly impacted, probably because grain had to be transported regardless of whether the water was high or low. A kind of bull-nose-shaped stone ring was also chiseled on the cut wall, which could be used to tie up boat ropes or to hook up the punting poles. It is conceivable how difficult it was to struggle forward at that time. Often people broke the tow rope and fell into the water. Even now, there is still a saying circulating locally: "Risk your life to cross Sanmen."

For thousands of years, when people dreamed of "sailing across the green sea to reach the source of the river," they always thought that Sanmenxia had to be opened up.

But now, the people who are attacking the Yellow River see it as a jewel of the Yellow River.

This is an igneous rock called "syenite porphyry." The entire Sanmenxia is a whole piece of this hardest rock. Such igneous rock, within hundreds of kilometers of the Yellow River, is only found in this small piece of Sanmenxia. Experts who understand engineering geology know that the largest hydroelectric power station in the world can be built on this hard rock foundation.

Such a large-scale hydro junction is still not common in the world today. The Boulder Hydropower Station and the Grand Coulee Hydropower Station in the United States have been under construction for several decades. The Kubyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station in the Soviet Union, only took five years to complete. Our Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, with the help of the Soviet government, will also be completed within five years.

After this hydro junction is built, the Yellow River bends above Sanmenxia will become a large reservoir a little larger than Taihu Lake, equivalent to sixteen of the largest Guanting Reservoir in our country today. Such a large reservoir, used for flood control, can hold all the largest floods in the history of the Yellow River; used for irrigation, it can expand the irrigation area of the North China Plain by 20 million mu; used for power generation, it can supply industrial power to Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and other places for a considerable period of time; used for shipping, it can become an inland sea for navigation in the vast agricultural areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces. It can also clarify the floodwaters, evenly distribute them to the downstream, so that the downstream of the Yellow River will be a clear river of not too big or too small all year round!

However, the significance of Sanmenxia goes far beyond this. More importantly, only the Sanmenxia Reservoir can most quickly play a decisive role and strength in both fundamentally controlling the water damage of the Yellow River and developing the water conservancy of the Yellow River. We walked along the Yellow River embankment for four days, and we felt its urgent significance more and more deeply. (Attached picture)

    三门峡
    新华社特派记者　华山
    一个改变黄河自然面貌的伟大计划宣布了！
    一九五○年，在印度举行的国际防洪会议上，资产阶级的学者曾经悲观地预言：黄河是不可征服的，几千年以后甚至连华北大平原也可能变成沙漠了。我们却要在几十年内把黄河变清，把干旱多风的西北黄土高原变成绿色，把直泻狂奔几千公里的山中急流变成四十六个大小湖泊组成的阶梯，把几千年来一直在中国大平原上泛滥成灾的祸水变成幸福生活的源泉。——一句话：从根本上扭转黄河的历史。
    把黄河变清！这句话就和“太阳从西边出来”一样，自古以来就是拿来比喻绝不可能的事情的。从传说中的大禹开始，中国人民世世代代和黄河的洪水顽强搏斗着，光是从蜿蜒一千八百公里的黄河大堤看来，我国的水利早在古代就是先进的。可是把黄河变清，却是连想也没人敢这样想过。
    可是我们不仅敢想，而且要动手做了。
    修建三门峡水力枢纽，就是征服黄河的第一步。
    这一步，要在三门天险修筑起一座像山一样的混凝土坝来，把黄河拦腰堵住，堵成我国容积最大的一个人造大湖，这个大湖，可以把黄河三分之二以上的水给装住，让它在这里澄清，慢慢下泄，把暴涨暴落的洪水变成细水长流，不准它泛滥成灾，还要它给我们灌溉，发电，走船。——这一步也同样是这么激动人心的。
    一个月来，我随着一个综合的查勘团在黄河中下游来回跑了三千公里，一直被这种心情深深激动着。这个查勘团是由担任三门峡设计工作的苏联专家组和我国的专家们组成的。曾经征服了伏尔加河—顿河运河的人们，又在帮助我们征服黄河了。
    三门峡在潼关和洛阳附近的邙山之间。这是黄河流进华北大平原以前的最后一段峡谷地带。三门峡就是其中最险要的一座山峡：两岸陡削，坚硬，只隔二百五十公尺，进口有两座石岛并排把住，出口有三座石岛顶住激流，半当腰两岸还突出来两座岩石半岛，把激流紧紧卡住，只空出一百二十公尺宽的一道小豁口。我们爬上高山，俯瞰河谷。三门峡其实就是一整块横在河上的岩磐。只是多少年来被急流冲开了一个缺口，就像用巨斧劈开那样。山峡间的小岛简直就是乱斧劈过的痕迹。大河从远方宽荡荡地奔流过来，越往东，越急，忽然被北岸的陡崖迎头兜住，顿时整个向南猛折，——正要顺着山峡急转直下，猛然被两座石岛迎面劈开，在山峡之间劈成惊心动魄的三股激流，这三股激流又从那一道小豁口同时硬冲出去，只震得满峡谷一片雷声。自古称为三门天险，把这三条水路叫做“人门”，“神门”，“鬼门”，意思是非常危险，除了左岸的“人门河”勉强可以走船以外，中间的神门河和右岸的鬼门河只有神鬼才能通过。
    山峡中间有一座非常小的小石岛，刚刚从水面冒出个尖来，眼看就要被吞没，冲垮，几千年来却一直在激流当中挺立着。这就是有名的“中流砥柱”，也叫“砥柱石”，自古以来就是我国民族性格的象征。
    相传大禹凿龙门，开砥柱，就是说三门峡是用人工凿开的。悬崖上刻有两句歌颂大禹功迹的话：“峭壁雄流，鬼斧神工”。
    实际上，这个传说不只反映了人们打通三门天险的愿望，也反映了几千年来的治河根本思想：疏浚河道。从三门峡也可以看出人们是怎样和黄河搏斗过来的。
    北岸有一条穿过岩石的人工渠道，叫做“开元新河”。老百姓叫它“娘娘河”，也叫“公主河”，意思是给皇家运粮用的。这是一千多年前唐代开元年间的工程，长三百公尺，正好和原来的三段水路并行，硬是把整个岩石半岛齐岸边切开了。现在看起来还是这末整齐，笔挺。这是一种非常坚硬的火成岩，苏联专家对这个古老的工程很感兴趣，因为那时候全世界都还没有火药。要从这种最坚硬岩石开出一条运河来，没有最大的魄力和极其顽强的劳动是做不到的。
    直到陇海路修通以前，三门峡一直是西北和东南诸省的交通孔道。特别是西汉和隋唐时代，大批粮食从山东和江淮流域顺着水路运来，经过这里，运到古都长安，最多时曾经到过四百万石。可是三门峡水急岛多，水底下还有礁滩和猛跌下去二十八公尺的悬崖。要逆水行舟更是困难。最严重时粮船损失到过十分之七八。因此汉隋唐三代都曾经大举开凿河道。做皇帝的也亲到现场查勘。可是三次都失败了。开元运渠也是一种打通三门天险的工程。可是这条水道，水浅了船过不去，水深了又同样湍急。到底没有成功。
    于是又修凿运粮栈道，从栈道上拉纤过三门。现在好些石壁上还可以看到一排排凿得深深的四方洞子，栈道的木桩就是从方洞楔到削壁上的。特别是人门河的右岸，百来公尺长的陡崖就有两条栈道的遗迹：一上一下，都是紧挨着激流直接冲击的地方，大概当时水涨水落都是要运粮的。削壁上还凿有一种牛鼻子形的石环，可以拴上船索，也可以搭上撑船的倒钩。可以想见当时往前挣扎一步多末困难。常常有人拉断纤绳，掉到水里去了。直到现在当地还流行一句话：“舍命过三门”。
    几千年来，当人们梦想着“扬帆碧海达河源”的时候，总是认为非把三门峡凿开不可的。
    可是现在，向黄河进攻的人们却把它看成黄河的一块宝石了。
    这是一种叫做“闪长斑岩”的火成岩。整个三门峡就是一整块这种最坚硬的岩石。这样的火成岩，在黄河几百公里的地带以内，就只有三门峡这末一小块。懂得工程地质的专家都知道：在这块坚硬的岩磐上完全可以修筑起世界上最大的一种水电站来。
    这种规模宏大的水力枢纽，全世界直到现在还是不多的。美国的波尔德水电站和大古力水电站，都建设了好几十年。而苏联的古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站，只要五年就建设完成了。我们的三门峡水电站在苏联政府的帮助下，也将在五年内建设完成。
    这个水力枢纽筑成以后，三门峡以上的黄河河曲将要变成一个比太湖还要大一点的大水库，等于现在我国最大的官厅水库十六个。这样大的水库，用来防洪，可以把黄河历史上最大的洪水全给装起来；用来灌溉，可以扩大华北大平原灌溉面积二千万亩；用来发电，可以供给陕西、山西、河南等地的相当时期以内的工业动力；用来航运，可以成为晋陕豫三省广大农业地区通航的内海。还可以把洪水澄清，匀开来供给下游，让黄河下游一年四季都是不大不小的清水河！
    可是，三门峡的意义还远不止此。更重要的是：只有三门峡水库才能最快地在根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利两方面产生决定性的作用和力量。我们沿着黄河大堤走了四天，就越发深深地感到它的紧迫意义了。（附图片）
