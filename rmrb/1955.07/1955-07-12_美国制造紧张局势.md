    U.S. Creates Tensions

    As the Four-Power Summit approaches, the U.S. activities to create tensions become increasingly blatant.

    The latest trick is the clamor launched by the U.S. aggressive bloc. Despite the fact that the Laotian Fighting Units had already protested the new military offensive by the Royal Lao Army against the Laotian Fighting Units on July 3, the U.S. stubbornly insisted that the Laotian Fighting Units launched a "fierce attack" on Laos. The U.S. State Department spokesman personally came forward, blatantly lying that this "attack" was the "largest-scale military action" taken by the "Communists" in Laos "since the signing of the Geneva Accords." As usual, they also dragged China into this lie.

    This kind of sudden drumbeat at midnight by the U.S. aggressive bloc has never frightened anyone. During the Asian-African Conference, the U.S. launched a campaign, shouting that China was about to regularly attack Taiwan, hoping to disrupt the Asian-African Conference. But what was the result? It exposed its shameful eagerness to create tensions, and the Asian-African people therefore demanded even more strongly that the conference be successful.

    Now, the U.S. aggressive bloc seems to feel that it is not enough to simply lie and slander Laos; it believes it is necessary to make even more noise.

    Whenever it wants to make such a fuss in the Far East, that poodle of Holubrecht always comes out barking.

    Holubrecht shouted wildly about "Communist aggression," carrying the banner of the "Southeast Asia Treaty" and running out to call names. He wants Britain and France to do something, and wants Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan to pay attention. In short, he wants these so-called Southeast Asia Treaty countries to line up and march with him.

    This is a vivid and ugly display of war threats.

    Who exactly is aggressing against whom?

    Isn't it the U.S. that has forcibly included Laos as a "protected" country of the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization"? Isn't it the U.S. that is plotting to engage in military agreements with Laos, attempting to undermine the Geneva Accords? The U.S. interferes in Laos' internal affairs, air-dropping bandits into the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units stipulated by the Geneva Accords, provoking war there, causing the political conference between the Laotian Fighting Units and the Kingdom of Laos to be disrupted many times, and still unable to be successfully held. Now, even a military conference has been disrupted by this nerve war launched by the U.S. Aren't these facts ironclad proof that the U.S. wants to undermine the Geneva Accords and intensify its aggression in Indochina?

    The Geneva Accords stipulate that the issues between the Laotian Fighting Units and the Kingdom of Laos should be resolved politically. The International Commission for Laos' letter to the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos on June 15 also advocated a political solution.

    But the U.S. insists on not doing so. It wants to fight, and now it even wants to drag the "Southeast Asia Treaty" countries to fight with it. These are the U.S. aggressive bloc's undeniable facts of aggression.

    Knowing that everyone sees these facts, and they still want to cover their faces and boast and make a big fuss, creating this so-called "thunderbolt" of "Communist aggression" by Holubrecht, isn't this a joke?

    No, for the U.S. aggressive bloc, this is not a joke, it is a great worry.

    The international situation is easing. The Four-Power Summit is about to be held. Many countries and billions of people want the situation to ease further. They want the Four-Power Summit to discuss major international issues, and also to discuss the Far East issue. The U.S. aggressive bloc is being forced into a corner, and the huge military profits of U.S. monopoly capital are increasingly threatened. The U.S. does not have many new tricks. It can only make the situation tense, make the Four-Power Summit unsuccessful, and keep people constantly worried, hoping to maintain its market for arms stocks in this way.

    However, the international situation is not a toy in the hands of the U.S. aggressive bloc. The more it tries to create tensions, the less the people will allow it to succeed.

### 美国制造紧张局势

    美国制造紧张局势
    四国首脑会议越来越逼近，美国制造紧张局势的活动也越来越露骨了。
    最新的花样是美国侵略集团发动的大叫嚣。尽管寮国战斗部队在七月三日已经抗议了老挝王国军队对寮国战斗部队的新军事进攻，美国却硬指寮国战斗部队对老挝发动了什么“激烈攻击”。美国国务院发言人亲自出马，公然撒谎，说这次“攻击”是日内瓦协定签订以来“共产党”在老挝“所曾采取的最大规模的军事行动”。他们照例又把中国同这种谎言扯在一起。
    美国侵略集团这种夜半突发的锣鼓从来是吓不倒人的。在亚非会议期间，美国曾经发动一个运动，大喊中国已经定期要进攻台湾，希图借此把亚非会议冲垮。但是，它得到了什么结果呢？它暴露了它急于制造紧张的可耻模样，亚非人民因此更要求把会议开好。
    现在，美国侵略集团似乎觉得光是撒谎诬蔑寮国还不够，它认为有必要闹得更大一些。
    每当它要在远东这样闹的时候，总是霍布雷奇特那条哈巴狗出来汪汪叫喊。
    霍布雷奇特狂呼着“共产党侵略”，肩着“东南亚条约”的旗子跑出来点名。他要英国和法国做点什么，要澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦注意。总而言之，他要这些所谓东南亚条约国家排队，跟着他进军。
    这是一幅活生生的摆弄战争威胁的丑相。
    究竟是谁侵略了谁呢？
    难道不是美国把老挝硬编成“东南亚条约集团”的被“保护”国么？难道不是美国在阴谋同老挝搞军事协定，企图破坏日内瓦协议么？美国干涉老挝内政，空投匪徒到日内瓦协议规定的寮国战斗部队的集结地区，在那里挑起战争，致使寮国战斗部队同老挝王国的政治会议多次受到破坏，至今开不成功。现在，甚至连一个军事会议都被美国发动的这一场神经战破坏了。这些事实难道不是美国想破坏日内瓦协议，加紧侵略印度支那的铁的证据？
    日内瓦协议规定关于寮国战斗部队和老挝王国之间的问题要作政治解决。老挝国际委员会六月十五日给老挝王国首相的信也主张政治解决。
    可是美国却坚持不这样干。它要打，它现在甚至想拖着“东南亚条约”国家来打。这就是美国侵略集团无可辩解的侵略事实。
    明知人人都看到了这些事实，而他们偏要遮着脸大吹大擂，制造这种霍布雷奇特所谓的“共产党侵略”的“晴天霹雳”，这不是笑话么？
    不，对美国侵略集团来说，这不是笑话，这是极大的苦衷。
    国际局势在缓和。四国首脑会议要召开。许多国家和亿万人民要局势再缓和一些。他们要四国会议讨论国际重大问题，还要讨论远东问题。美国侵略集团被逼到墙角了，美国垄断资本的庞大军事利润越来越受到了威胁。美国没有多少新法门。它只有使局势紧张，使四国会议开不好，使人们老是人心惶惶，希图这样来保住它的军火股票的市场。
    可是，国际局势不是美国侵略集团手里的玩物。它越要制造紧张，人民就越不会使它得逞。
