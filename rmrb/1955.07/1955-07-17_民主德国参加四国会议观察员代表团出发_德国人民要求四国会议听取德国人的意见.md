Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 16th – According to a report by the German News Agency: People from all walks of life in East and West Germany have successively demanded that the heads of government of the four powers listen to the opinions of the German people at the meeting in Geneva, and demanded further easing of the international situation and peaceful reunification of Germany.

Representatives of democratic groups and municipal councils in Zittau, German Democratic Republic, have written to the heads of government of the four powers, requesting them to listen to the opinions of the German representatives.

Residents of Stuttgart, Hamburg, and Bremen in West Germany held torchlight parades and demonstrations on the 13th and 14th, demanding that a pan-German delegation be sent to the Geneva Conference.

Dr. Gerber, a professor at Humboldt University in the German Democratic Republic, said: The Geneva Conference must make resolutions in accordance with the declaration issued in San Francisco that will help to further ease the situation and destroy the cause of warmongers.

West German church leader Niemöller and former German Chancellor Wirth spoke to reporters from the Dutch "Truth Daily," emphasizing disarmament and the peaceful reunification of Germany. Niemöller expressed the hope that the four major powers would reach an agreement on disarmament and hoped that Adenauer would visit Moscow.

The "West German Daily" wrote in its commentary on the TASS statement: Bonn must no longer continue down the old road. The Social Democratic "New Rhein Newspaper" reminded its readers: The Federal Republic's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is blocking the road to reunification.
