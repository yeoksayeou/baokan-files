　　The Misfortune of the Original Equipment at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory
　　Han Dongda
    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory is being rebuilt with modern technology and equipment, and has already begun trial-producing the very impressive 1A62 lathe. This is a cause for celebration. However, now that the new machinery and equipment are being installed, how should the original machinery and equipment be handled? In this matter, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory's habit of favoring the new and disliking the old, and wasting state property, is intolerable.

    A walk through the workshops, yards, and warehouses of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory reveals numerous pieces of original equipment lying around haphazardly. In the dusty, under-reconstruction No. 2 Workshop, there are still four or five original machine tools parked. The small electric rollers on the machine tools have fallen off, scattered haphazardly on the ground, and much of the light blue paint has peeled off. Does this mean these machine tools are unusable and can be neglected? No. The Russian characters on the machine tools tell us that most of them came from the Soviet Union, and their models are the same as the newly arrived machine tools. It's just because they arrived earlier and have been in use for a period of time that they are regarded as "old equipment" and treated so shabbily. The soon-to-be-completed No. 3 Workshop also has a hexagonal lathe and two presses suffering the same fate. A short distance west of the No. 3 Workshop's west gate, you can see a half-ton pneumatic hammer, its body split in two, lying upside down in a pile of sand.

    If you go to the temporary warehouse in the northeast corner, you will find dozens of machine tools placed crookedly. The crank handle of a lathe's tool holder is bent, apparently broken from impact, and although the grinding wheel is there, its base is missing.

    Some of the original equipment, because it was not intended for reuse, has been dismantled and sold as "scrap steel." Cao Fuxing, the chief foreman of the foundry workshop, saw factory trucks transporting "scrap steel" out of the warehouse one day. He took a closer look and found that there were many pieces of mechanical equipment from the former foundry and forging workshops inside. He reported this to the deputy director of the factory, and went to the warehouse to mark the usable equipment, so that it was not completely sold as "scrap steel."

    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory must immediately correct its crude attitude towards the original equipment. In the spirit of rigorous economy, it should conduct an inventory of the original equipment, package it, and complete the acceptance and transfer procedures.

　　沈阳第一机床厂原有设备的厄运
　　韩洞达
    沈阳第一机床厂正在用现代化的技术装备进行改建，而且已能开始试制出很漂亮的一A六二车床。这是一件令人高兴的事。可是，新的机器设备安装起来了，对原有的机器设备怎么处理呢？在这个问题上，沈阳第一机床厂喜新厌旧、糟蹋国家财产的作风，是不能容忍的。
    在沈阳第一机床厂的车间、场院、仓库里走一趟，我们会看到许多原有设备横七竖八地躺在那儿。正在改建的尘土飞扬的二车间里，还停放着四、五台原有的机床。机床上的小电滚已经掉下来，东一个西一个胡乱地扔在地上，浅蓝色的油漆也已经剥落了不少。难道这些机床已经不能使用，可以不加爱护了吗？不是的。机床上的俄文字样告诉我们，它们大多来自苏联，而且和新运来的机床的型号都是一样的，只是因为它们来的早了些，已经使用了一个时期，便被看做是“旧设备”而遭到如此难堪的待遇。快要改建完了的三车间，也有一台六角车床和两台压力机遭受着同样的命运。出了三车间的西门，走不远，便会看见一台半吨重的气锤，锤身被分作两半，倒放在砂土堆里。
    如果再走到东北角的临时仓库里看一看，就会发现数十台机床都是七弯八斜地放着，有一个车床上的刀架子的摇把已经弯了，看样子是被碰坏的，砂轮机虽在，但底座已不知去向了。
    还有一部分原有设备，因为不准备留用，已经被拆散当“废钢铁”卖掉了。翻砂车间总工长曹复兴，一天看到厂里的载重汽车由仓库往外运“废钢铁”。他走近一看，里边有许多是过去翻砂和锻冶两个车间的机械设备。他把这事报告给副厂长，并去仓库把可用的设备画上了记号，才没有完全当“废钢铁”卖掉。
    沈阳第一机床厂必须立即纠正对待原有设备的粗暴态度。应该根据厉行节约的精神，进行对原有设备的清点、包装，和办理验收、移交手续。
