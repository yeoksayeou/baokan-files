LIN TIE'S SPEECH

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report "On the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan" and enthusiastically support the implementation of the first five-year plan. I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report "On the Draft of the People's Republic of China's Military Service Law," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report "On the Work of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress," and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report "On the Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Resources."

Our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy is based on the total task of the transitional period clearly stipulated in our constitution and is a major step of decisive significance in realizing this total task. There is no doubt that the realization of this great plan will bring about significant changes in the face of our national economy and lay the initial foundation for our country to transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and through the united and arduous efforts of the entire nation, we will definitely be able to complete and even overfulfill the various glorious and enormous tasks set out in our country's first five-year plan.

As Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out in his report, to establish a powerful material foundation for our socialist country, we must concentrate our efforts on developing industry, especially prioritizing the development of heavy industry, while correspondingly developing agriculture. This is completely correct, and I firmly support it. Developing agriculture is a fundamental condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan. In the first five-year plan, the requirements for developing agriculture, the path of developing agriculture, and the various measures for realizing the agricultural production plan are all completely correct. The various planned targets set out are based on the necessary demands of the state and the people, and also consider the possible conditions for realizing this plan. Therefore, it is active and is also built on a reliable foundation. Here, I would like to propose some opinions on how Hebei Province can realize the state's first five-year plan for increasing grain and cotton production.

According to the requirements of the state's first five-year plan, by 1957, the cultivated area of grain crops in Hebei Province should reach 125,408,000 mu, with a total production of 181,666,000,000 jin, and a yield of 150.55 jin per mu; this is an increase of 1.69% in total production compared to 1952 (the year with the highest harvest in six years) and an increase of 4.98% in unit area yield. The cultivated area of cotton should reach 1,886,000 mu by 1957, with a total production of 74,355,000,000 jin, and a yield of 39 jin per mu; this is an increase of 27.11% in total production compared to 1952 and an increase of 2.6% in unit area yield. This requirement is in line with the actual situation in Hebei Province. Hebei Province has always had a shortage of grain production, requiring the central government to allocate large amounts of grain from other regions to support us each year; at the same time, the proportion of industrial raw material crops is large, with cotton alone accounting for approximately one-quarter of the national total production, playing a significant role in supporting the national industrialization effort. Therefore, completing and overfulfilling the above grain and cotton production tasks is of great significance to national construction. To complete this task, I believe the following major measures should be taken:

First, on the basis of improving existing agricultural production cooperatives, actively and steadily further develop agricultural mutual aid and cooperation. Our province currently has more than 98,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with 2,700,000 households joining, accounting for approximately 35% of the total households. In the next three years, on the basis of improving the nearly 100,000 existing agricultural production cooperatives, we should appropriately expand them. The plan is to increase the total number of households by approximately 25% in the next three years, meaning that by 1957, 60% of the total households will have joined cooperatives. This will not only lay a significant foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture in our province but also provide a powerful guarantee for completing the grain and cotton production tasks in our province.

Second, regulate rivers, develop agricultural water conservancy, and vigorously carry out flood control, waterlogging prevention, and drought prevention. Our province has many rivers, with rainfall concentrated in certain periods, upstream slopes, and narrow downstream channels, leading to poor drainage. Therefore, floods have occurred every year. In the past six years, floods and waterlogging have affected a total of 120,000,000 mu of land, with an average of 21,000,000 mu affected each year. In 1954 alone, due to floods, 38,000,000,000 jin of grain and 1,000,000,000 jin of cotton were lost. Except for 1952, when the floods were particularly light, affecting only 120,000 mu, and a bumper harvest was achieved, in the past few years, due to floods, the agricultural production plan has not been completed. To change this situation, based on the principle of "combining immediate and long-term measures, and giving equal importance to flood control and drainage," we should start from river basin planning, strengthen river regulation, and gradually implement fundamental flood control projects. Based on the principle of comprehensive water resource development, we should start the fundamental project of the Ziya River system's Hutuo River by the end of the first five-year plan. At the same time, we should widely carry out mass water storage and drainage projects, do a good job of flood prevention, and ensure that rivers do not breach during normal flood levels. Additionally, we must follow the spirit of "utilizing nature, transforming nature, and turning disasters into benefits" to actively and steadily carry out production reforms in low-lying areas. This year, our province, in the Tianjin area, combined with the construction of water storage and drainage projects, carried out trial production reforms in low-lying areas, completing 21,000,000 mu, and achieved good results. Just by changing the cultivation of 70,000 mu of potatoes, we have already harvested 1,000,000,000 jin. The people are very happy and have strengthened their confidence in changing cultivation. The province has approximately 18,000,000 mu of waterlogged areas, and if we carry out production reforms suitable to local conditions, turning late-maturing crops into early-maturing crops and turning waterlogged areas into production areas, we can potentially increase grain production by 700,000,000 to 800,000,000 jin. Of course, this requires long-term arduous work to achieve, and we plan to complete the production reform of 10,000,000 mu of land in waterlogged areas by 1957.

The people of Hebei Province enthusiastically support the comprehensive plan for controlling the Yellow River floods and developing Yellow River water resources. The realization of this great plan will not only permanently eliminate the damage caused by the Yellow River's changes and breaches over thousands of years but also turn disasters into benefits. After the implementation of the first phase of water resource development, Hebei Province can expand irrigated land by 40,000,000 mu and increase grain production by several billion jin each year. The people of Hebei Province, for their own interests and the interests of the entire nation, will definitely strive to realize this great plan for controlling and developing the Yellow River.

Third, expand the planting area of high-yield crops and improve land utilization. This year, our province plans to increase the planting of high-yield crops by 28,000,000 mu, making the total planting area of high-yield crops in the province reach 32,000,000 mu, accounting for 26.5% of the grain crop area. By 1957, the total planting area of high-yield crops in the province should reach 38,000,000 mu, accounting for 31% of the grain crop area. The realization of this plan will, under normal weather conditions, increase grain production by approximately 7,000,000,000 jin. This will play a significant role in improving the grain shortage situation in our province. The main method to improve land utilization is to expand the planting area of wheat. Our province has approximately 53,000,000 mu of land suitable for wheat cultivation, of which approximately 40,000,000 mu can be double-cropped. In the past, the wheat planting area in our province has accounted for approximately 60% of the land suitable for wheat. We plan that by 1957, the wheat sowing area in the entire province will reach 38,000,000 mu, thereby increasing the double-cropping area by 4,000,000 mu and increasing grain production by 2,000,000,000 jin. Additionally, our province has approximately 7,000,000 mu of wasteland, and through active and planned reclamation, we can also increase grain production.

Fourth, continue to improve and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, which is a decisive factor in realizing the agricultural production plan. In the past few years, the leadership of agricultural production by various levels of party and government organs in our province has improved and been continuously strengthened, but there is still a significant amount of bureaucratism and subjectivism in leadership work. This is mainly manifested in the general leadership, lack of thorough investigation and research into local conditions, lack of in-depth inspections, and lack of specific assistance. In the future, to strengthen the leadership of agriculture, in addition to strictly implementing the central government's instructions that all levels of party committees and governments from the province to the township must take the leadership of agricultural production and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation as the focus of their work, we must oppose bureaucratic work styles and adopt specific and in-depth work methods. We must oppose commandist methods and adopt mass line methods. To strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, we must also streamline the upper-level leadership organs and strengthen the lower levels. Our province's provincial administrative staffing plan initially plans to streamline approximately 20% to 30% of the staff. Additionally, we plan to assign more than 11,000 people from the existing cadres to the townships as county and district resident guidance officers. This will not only strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level but also help overcome bureaucratism and paper-pushing in the leadership organs, improving work efficiency.

Finally, I would like to express that we will spare no effort to mobilize the people of the entire province to strive to complete and overfulfill the great tasks set out in our country's first five-year plan.

LIN FENG'S SPEECH

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for developing the national economy, proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and approved by the State Council, and submitted to the conference. I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the conference.

In recent years, the nationwide work in culture, education, and health, relying on the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, with the support and supervision of the people, and through the joint efforts of all cultural and educational workers, has achieved tremendous success in cultivating and building cadres and improving the cultural life of the people. These achievements have laid a good foundation for more planned and better cultural and educational construction in the future.

Based on the current situation of cultural and educational work, to adapt to the requirements of our country's economic construction and improving the cultural life of the people, future cultural and educational work should, on the basis of existing work, focus on improving quality and develop steadily and with a focus, while implementing the principles of reasonable distribution in regions and comprehensive arrangements in public and private affairs.

To successfully realize the total task of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, the primary task of cultural and educational work is to vigorously cultivate various construction cadres, especially technical and management cadres for industrial construction. The work of cultivating cadres should be carried out from two aspects: one is to cultivate through higher education and secondary specialized schools; the other is to cultivate through various forms of adult education.

In the past few years, higher education and secondary specialized education have developed significantly. The number of students in higher education institutions increased from 117,133 in 1949 to 257,731 in 1954, an increase of 120%. The number of students in secondary specialized schools increased from 77,095 in 1949 to 300,023 in 1954, an increase of 289%. In higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools, the number of science students increased even faster; the number of science students in higher education institutions increased by 213% from 1949 to 1954, and the number of science students in secondary specialized schools increased by 423% from 1950. In terms of quality, due to the active learning of Soviet experience and the implementation of school system adjustments, specialty settings, and teaching reforms, the quality has not only improved significantly compared to the old China but also improved year by year. However, the work of cultivating cadres still cannot meet the needs of national construction in terms of quality assurance. This is because our country is currently carrying out great socialist construction, and the new industries at the center of construction are all equipped with the most advanced technology, which requires that the construction cadres we cultivate must be loyal to the country, loyal to the cause of socialist construction, proficient in modern scientific and technological knowledge, and physically healthy. Without a large number of such cadres, the industrialization cause cannot be completed. In the past few years, the graduates from higher education institutions were mostly good, but there was also a considerable number of people with low academic standards, poor health, and unable to perform their duties. There was also a small number of people with poor political quality, some with reactionary thoughts and dissatisfaction with socialist construction; some even went to factories and mines not to participate in construction but to engage in sabotage activities. This situation must be changed. The cadres we cultivate should be genuine socialist construction cadres and not provide qualifications for counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. Therefore, in the future, we must take various measures to focus on improving quality, especially political quality. Higher education institutions should first strictly enforce admission standards, and in terms of politics, academics, and health, they must be qualified. For students who have already been admitted, we should also carefully rectify them. We should vigorously strengthen political and ideological education and improve the socialist consciousness of teachers and students. Of course, improving quality is a long-term and arduous task, and it should be gradually improved on the existing basis and not rushed or forced to be uniform. We should also pay attention to cultivating key schools, providing them with better conditions, and at the same time, putting forward more and higher requirements for them, so that we can have some schools with relatively high scientific and technological levels to cultivate a batch of students with relatively high levels and use the experience of key schools to guide and promote the work of general schools.

Based on the current situation of our country's technical strength being insufficient in quantity and low in quality, in the future, while focusing on improving quality, we must also consider quantity, and correctly combine improving quality and increasing quantity. The scale of development of higher education institutions in the first five-year plan is very large. In five years, the number of students in higher education institutions will increase by 127.4%, of which the number of science students will increase by 166.8%. In the second five-year plan period, there will be 177,000 graduates from higher industrial schools (of which 154,000 are five-year graduates), which is more than three times the number of science graduates in the first five-year plan period. Such a development speed is unimaginable in capitalist countries. In the second five-year plan period, the number of science graduates will exceed the total number of science graduates from national universities in the 20 years of the Kuomintang's rule by more than four times. This means that our task of cultivating cadres is very arduous.

Another important aspect of the work of cultivating construction cadres is to carry out adult education. We have not paid enough attention to this in the past, and in the future, we must vigorously strengthen adult education work, so that a large number of in-service cadres and workers can systematically improve their cultural and scientific levels. We must see that adult education is a relatively effective way to cultivate and improve cadres, with broad prospects for development, and will play a major role in the cause of cultivating construction cadres.

With the continuous development of national construction, a large number of in-service cadres and workers feel that their current cultural and scientific and technological levels cannot meet the requirements of work and production, and they urgently need to improve. From the situation in the industrial and mining enterprises, in recent years, a large number of cadres have been transferred from other departments to industrial and mining work, and at the same time, a large number of outstanding workers have been promoted to become management and technical cadres. According to incomplete statistics, in the two and a half years from January 1952 to September 1954, 163,000 cadres were transferred from other departments to the industrial and mining departments, of which nearly 16,000 were county-level and above cadres. In recent years, the number of cadres promoted from workers is also very large. According to incomplete statistics last year, 73,000 technical cadres were promoted from workers, accounting for 26% of the total number of technical cadres at that time. In the future, there will definitely be a large number of outstanding workers continuing to grow into cadres. These two types of cadres are mostly the backbone of industrial and mining enterprises, they are politically reliable, they have experience in struggle and production, but most of them lack systematic cultural and scientific knowledge, which is the main difficulty in their mastery of modern science and technology and advanced enterprise management methods. If this large number of outstanding cadres are improved in a planned manner, it will have a significant positive impact on our country's socialist construction cause.

There is also a large number of technical cadres in the industrial and mining departments who graduated from secondary specialized schools. In the first five-year plan period, 180,000 graduates from secondary specialized schools will go to work in factories and mines, and if they are cultivated and improved, a considerable number of senior technical cadres may be grown in the second five-year plan period.

Similarly, in other departments, a large number of workers and cadres also have low cultural levels and cannot fully meet the requirements of work, and they also urgently need to improve. Among the 3.8 million cadres at the district level and above nationwide, more than 2 million have not reached the level of junior high school education. Therefore, improving the cultural and scientific levels of these workers and cadres has become an important task in current national construction.

To improve the cultural levels of a large number of in-service cadres and workers, in the future, we must adopt the principle of focusing on adult education. In schools, factories, and offices, we should set up a large number of regular adult schools and correspondence schools from primary school to university. The experience of many factories has proven that this can achieve good results. The technical cadres trained by adult schools, due to their rich operational experience and their learning closely combined with production practice, have good quality. If we can pay attention to this nationwide, and if various levels of leadership can generally attach importance to it, formulate plans, and gradually carry out adult education, we can cultivate a large number of cadres. We must see that in factories, offices, and schools, there will always be some people who can persist in adult education and can learn well, and we must create appropriate conditions for them to learn, so that they can be cultivated into cadres.

However, carrying out adult education is not without difficulties. There are many problems in terms of teachers, teaching materials, funds, learning time, and organizational leadership. We will study and solve these problems in a practical manner to ensure the smooth development of adult education.

To effectively complete the five-year plan, in addition to cultivating a large number of construction cadres, we must gradually improve the cultural life of the people. In recent years, the government and the people have made great efforts in this regard, and ordinary education, cultural arts, and health care have all developed significantly, and will continue to develop in the future. However, cultural and educational work must follow the development of economic construction and adopt the principle of steady development. If we emphasize the importance of cultural and educational work in a one-sided and isolated manner, it will actually cause cultural and educational work to detach from economic construction, especially from industrial construction, and develop disproportionately, which is inappropriate. The socialist construction requires people to learn culture, and the idea that labor does not need culture, or that junior high school graduates do not want to work and must go to college, are all unrealistic and wrong.

In the future, we should adopt more measures to develop grassroots cultural and educational work, gradually improve the cultural life of the people on the basis of gradual popularization. In addition to the state's planned development of cultural and educational work, currently, various local groups are voluntarily and actively contributing money and effort to set up many primary schools, community schools, night schools, clubs, amateur drama troupes, joint clinics, nurseries, kindergartens, health stations, and other facilities. This is a very worthy method to pay attention to. With the development of production and the improvement of living standards, the broad masses have the ability and initiative to set up many grassroots cultural and educational facilities. They are very willing to set up these facilities because these facilities actually solve many of their problems. If we can fully mobilize the strength of the broad masses and strengthen leadership, then the development prospects of these facilities are very great. This not only opens up a broad path for the development of cultural and educational work but also allows the state to free up more funds to invest in industrial construction.

However, some people do not support or look down on privately-run cultural and educational facilities. They have thoughts of being bothered and not being formal, and often adopt a negative and indifferent attitude towards privately-run cultural and educational facilities, allowing them to die out on their own, always trying to have the government take over everything. As a result, the government neither can take over nor wants private initiatives. This not only greatly damages the enthusiasm of the masses but also hinders the development of the cause. Therefore, we should adopt the principle of actively promoting and strengthening leadership for the cultural and educational facilities set up by the masses. As long as it is truly voluntary, the masses themselves raise funds, and there are necessary manpower, we should allow the masses to set up their own facilities and strengthen leadership in a practical manner, so that they can develop in a planned and step-by-step manner. For privately-run facilities, we should not demand too much, force uniformity, or overly emphasize formalization, but should allow them to adapt to local conditions and, according to different conditions, formulate appropriate and feasible systems and management methods, so that they can be connected and coordinated with the various related work of the government's cultural and educational departments, avoiding various deviations. Special attention should be paid to preventing blind development and wasteful spending.

For the cultural and educational facilities set up by the masses and the cultural and educational facilities set up by industrial and mining enterprises and private individuals, we should implement comprehensive arrangements and include them in the national plan, so that they can effectively serve national economic construction.

For the cultural and educational work in minority regions, we should especially help them. For minorities that have their own language but no written script, we should help them create a script. The school education and medical and health work in minority regions should be vigorously developed, and their cultural and artistic heritage should be organized, improved, and developed according to their characteristics. In addition, we should also provide manpower and financial support to the cultural and educational work in old liberated areas and culturally underdeveloped regions, so that they can have more development. Culturally developed regions should regard supporting these regions as their honorable task.

To practice thrift and provide more funds for industrial construction is also an important task for the cultural and educational departments.

Currently, the phenomenon of waste in various aspects of the cultural and educational departments is very serious and must be practically overcome. In basic construction, we must strictly follow the standards set by the state to reduce construction costs and quotas. In the future, whether it is the construction of new schools, hospitals, theaters, and cinemas, we must resolutely oppose waste and the pursuit of form, and seriously promote the spirit of hard work and plain living. In education, we should advocate students commuting as much as possible and seriously implement the double-shift system to improve the utilization rate of teaching equipment. In health and culture, we should improve the utilization rate of hospital beds and theater and cinema seats to fully exploit the potential of existing buildings and equipment and reduce the state's investment in cultural and educational infrastructure as much as possible. For some regular expenses and the proportion of personnel staffing, we should conduct a serious review and reduce them. In the arts, we should implement the principle of enterprise management.

Based on the above spirit, recently, the State Council's cultural and educational departments have, on the basis of reducing 400 million yuan of funds for the last three years of the first five-year plan in the spring, further reduced 560 million yuan. A total of nearly 1 billion yuan of cultural and educational funds have been saved for the state; but the work has not been reduced. We believe that the cultural and educational departments, as long as they seriously implement the spirit of thrift, can also provide more funds for national industrial construction.

Socialist economic construction and socialist ideological construction are inseparable. To better serve national socialist construction, we must improve the political and ideological level of all cultural and educational workers, thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealist thought, and thoroughly rectify the cultural and educational ranks.

Bourgeois idealist thought is widely and seriously present in the cultural and educational departments. Its main manifestation is the tendency of non-political thought. Some people do not care about politics, do not attach importance to the study of Marxism-Leninism, do not link their work with national construction and the fate of the people, do not want to serve the current political tasks, and do not respect the leadership of the Communist Party. For example, the thought of some leaders in the Ministry of Health to discriminate against and eliminate traditional Chinese medicine is a manifestation of bourgeois erroneous thought. They, in violation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions on uniting Chinese and Western medicine, arbitrarily believe that traditional Chinese medicine is "feudal medicine," saying that traditional Chinese medicine is a product of feudal society and should be eliminated with the elimination of feudal society. They not only theoretically wrongly regard medicine as the superstructure of society, especially they ignore the great practical role of traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in our country's health work for thousands of years. They blindly worship capitalist culture, despise national cultural heritage, and hold a serious and arrogant sectarian attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine. What is even more serious is that after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao repeatedly pointed out the direction of this error, they still have not fundamentally changed in their actual work. The recent national cultural and educational work conference has conducted a serious criticism of the above erroneous thoughts, which is completely necessary. In the future, we must seriously implement the instructions of the Central Committee and do a better job of uniting Chinese and Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has rich experience and should be organized and improved; Western medicine has a modern scientific foundation and should humbly learn from traditional Chinese medicine and help them organize and improve. In this way, they can learn from each other and make joint progress, and better serve the health work of the people and the socialist construction of the motherland.

It should also be emphasized that our cultural and educational ranks are large and complex; in this team, the vast majority are good people who work diligently and have made many achievements; but it has been proven that there are also hidden counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. These counter-revolutionaries use two-faced methods to disguise themselves as Marxists and disguise themselves as revolutionary cultural and educational workers, using various treacherous and vicious methods to sabotage the revolutionary cause. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been hidden in the cultural and educational ranks for more than 20 years, their followers have occupied many positions in the cultural and educational departments, using counter-revolutionary thoughts to poison many pure young people and engage in counter-revolutionary activities. Their true faces were only exposed recently, which shows the serious situation of political complacency and organizational impurity in our cultural and educational ranks. All cultural and educational workers must wake up and resolutely fight against all hidden counter-revolutionaries, thoroughly expose and eliminate them.

To overcome bourgeois idealist thought and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, we must vigorously strengthen the study and propaganda of Marxism-Leninism in all cultural and educational departments, and make cultural and educational workers master the ideological weapons of dialectical and historical materialism, so that they can distinguish and criticize bourgeois idealist erroneous thoughts. It is especially important that all cultural and educational workers must realize that only by relying on the leadership of the Communist Party can they do a good job. The Communist Party of China, armed with invincible Marxism-Leninism, can not only lead military and political struggles to victory but also lead national economic construction to victory, and can and must lead cultural and educational work. Countless facts have proven that any revolutionary work without Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party cannot move forward. Any idea that the Party cannot lead cultural and educational work is extremely wrong and must be corrected.

Chairman Mao said:

"Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible.
The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China.
The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism.
We have full confidence that we can overcome all difficulties and build our country into a great socialist republic."

CHEN SHUTONG'S SPEECH

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for developing the national economy and Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report, and I fully agree with the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report.

Our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy is based on the constitution to realize the total task of the transitional period and is the beginning of the Chinese people's transition from a backward agricultural economy to socialist industrialization. This is a great beginning! When the first session of the First National People's Congress opened last year, Chairman Mao said: We are advancing. Today, we have such a great beginning of construction, which is a milestone in our progress. It is the beginning of our advance to the front line of advanced socialist industrialization in the world. There is no doubt that this great beginning will lead the Chinese people to permanently rid themselves of poverty and exploitation and move towards a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Everyone knows that the future of socialist industrialization is the result of the long-term bloody struggles of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. If it were not for the victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, if it were not for the increasingly consolidated and developed people's democratic system based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance, and if it were not for the sincere and selfless internationalist aid of the powerful socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union, we would not have such a great five-year plan. We, the people of the entire nation, should forever be grateful to the Communist Party of China, forever be grateful to Chairman Mao, and forever be grateful to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

After heated discussions, the first five-year plan allows us to see the situation more clearly, unify our understanding, and concentrate our efforts to move in the same direction. Based on my personal experience, I think that in the process of construction, we must first understand the following points.

First, we must understand that socialist industrialization is centered on the priority development of heavy industry. Only in this way can we transform the technology of our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation, strengthen and consolidate our national defense, continuously increase the production of agriculture and industry, and ensure the continuous improvement of the people's living standards. The first five-year plan is to implement the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, which is completely correct.

Second, we must understand that our country's five-year plan is realistic and feasible. This plan is formulated based on our country's current actual situation and specific conditions, in accordance with the possible resources and technical strength of our country, and implements the policy of focusing on key construction. Light and heavy industry, large, medium, and small enterprises, industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural construction, state-owned, cooperative, joint-stock, and private enterprises, production and consumption, domestic and international trade are not isolated from each other but are appropriately coordinated and connected, with a certain deployment and arrangement, forming an organic and closely integrated whole. Therefore, any fragmented views and local perspectives are inappropriate.

Third, we must understand that although our country's construction plan is centered on the development of heavy industry, it does not neglect the material and cultural needs of the people. From the perspective of the distribution ratio of basic construction investment in five years, although the industrial sector accounts for 58.2%, other sectors also account for 41.8%. From the perspective of the investment ratio of heavy industry and light industry, although the investment ratio of light industry is relatively small, state-owned and private light industry still have a considerable part of the potential that has not been used, and there is also a vast handicraft industry that can play an important supplementary role. For the investment in agriculture, although it does not seem large on the surface, some investments in heavy industry, such as tractors, chemical fertilizers, and hydropower, are all for the development of agriculture. Therefore, the increase in the production of means of production in five years is adapted to the development of light industry, agriculture, transportation, postal services, and cultural education and scientific research, and is adapted to the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards.

Fourth, we must understand that our country's first five-year plan was formulated after completing some tasks and gaining some experience in the implementation of two annual plans. Therefore, this five-year plan is more in line with reality and can better guarantee its successful completion. It is a major step in realizing the total task of the transitional period. Its successful completion will lay the initial foundation for our country's socialist industrialization, lay the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Therefore, the basic tasks of the first five-year plan and the second five-year plan are connected and inseparable. Some basic construction can be invested in a large scale in the first five-year plan, while others must be prepared in the first five-year plan before they can be invested in a large scale in the second five-year plan. The sequence and urgency must be carefully arranged.

Fifth, we must understand that in the process of implementing the plan, we will encounter some difficulties. Due to our lack of experience, insufficient technical strength, and unclear resource situation, and because we still have various economic components coexisting, especially because socialist construction is a major event that fundamentally reforms the living habits of 600 million people, we cannot imagine that such a great cause can be completed without effort. However, we have several years of construction experience, the support of all laboring people, the aid of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and especially the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, so we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and successfully implement our five-year plan.

Everyone knows that in our work, we should try to avoid making mistakes, but it is impossible not to make mistakes, and we have already made some mistakes in some aspects. For example, in the past few years of our construction, there has been a serious phenomenon of waste, which is an example. In the future, we should make fewer mistakes and not repeat the mistakes we have made; when we find mistakes in our work, we must correct them in time, especially pay attention to regular inspections, and prevent the occurrence of mistakes. Only in this way can we complete our plan well.

The five-year plan is closely related to all classes and strata of the people in the country. After this plan and the 1955 national budget are passed by the National People's Congress, they will become the construction guidelines and laws that the people of the entire nation must abide by. The people of the entire nation must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, take concrete actions to guarantee the successful completion of this plan. Only when the people of the entire nation can abide by the guidelines and laws of the state and do everything according to the guidelines and laws, can we perfectly realize our five-year plan.

The main source of funds for the five-year plan is the accumulation within the people. Practicing thrift is the only way to accumulate funds for national industrialization. The thrift movement must be a national movement. The people of the entire nation must continue to uphold the spirit of hard work and frugality, overcome any waste, reduce any unnecessary consumption, and save all possible materials and funds to supply the needs of national construction and guarantee the implementation of the five-year plan.

To mobilize the people of the entire nation to participate in socialist construction, we must make them understand that the state's policies are for the bright future of the entire nation, and therefore we must widely do a good job of propaganda and education on the five-year plan. The specific content of the five-year plan is the best patriotic teaching material. As long as we truly do a good job of propaganda and education, making the people of the entire nation truly understand our country's great construction plan, then the people of the entire nation will further love their country, love their lives, and be able to better exert their enthusiasm and creativity, and enthusiastically participate in the construction of the country.

The implementation of the five-year plan is a fierce, complex, and sharp struggle. In this struggle, domestic and foreign enemies will definitely collude to use every opportunity to sabotage our socialist construction. We must be hundreds of times more vigilant, strictly prevent the enemy's sabotage activities, and learn from the lessons of the Pan Han-nian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incidents to truly learn a way to identify the enemy, and gradually expose and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

In all classes and strata of the nation, I especially want to mention the responsibility of the business community today. The private industrial and commercial sector still occupies a considerable proportion in the first five-year plan and has an important role to play, and can make a certain contribution to the state and the people, which is one aspect. At the same time, the five-year plan is the law, and the business community should pay more attention to strictly abide by it. Because in the enemy's plot of attack, the business community is the weakest link. Some people are still wavering about socialist transformation, some people are still operating passively, some people are not clear-eyed, and their vigilance is low; and a few people are still committing the "five poisons," and some are even engaging in illegal activities of resisting leadership and sabotaging socialist transformation. This is unacceptable. In the future, private industrial and commercial practitioners must further enhance their vigilance, clarify the enemy and self boundaries, abide by the law, follow the plan, improve management, practice thrift, and with actual actions of actively accepting leadership and actively accepting socialist transformation to counter the enemy's sabotage plot, and guarantee the successful completion of the first five-year plan. The advanced representatives in the business community, under the education of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, should better fulfill their responsibilities, carry out propaganda and education work in the broad business community, play a leading, backbone, and bridge role, assist the government in promoting the private industrial and commercial practitioners nationwide to actively accept socialist transformation, strengthen personal ideological transformation, be honest and hardworking, and together with the people of the entire nation, strive towards the future of socialist construction.

JIN ZHONGHUA'S SPEECH

I enthusiastically support Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report "On the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan" and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The grand scale and bright future of the five-year plan inspire us greatly. The ideal of building socialism that the Chinese people have long pursued is beginning to become a reality. This great plan was formulated under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and it is completely in line with the overall, long-term, and highest interests of our entire nation.

To struggle for the implementation of the five-year plan is a glorious and arduous task for the people of our entire nation. We must grasp the key link and do a good job of ideological work. The central task of our country in the transitional period is to develop socialist industrialization, and the key link of socialist industrialization is to prioritize the development of heavy industry. We must carry out construction in a planned manner around this center. We must concentrate our main resources to develop heavy industry and must accumulate construction funds in a socialist manner from within. Without this basic line, our socialist construction will be in vain. Therefore, the implementation of the five-year plan cannot be without a series of arduous struggles, and every person must constantly test themselves from thought to action. Do we want to increase production and save resources, oppose waste, and accumulate funds for industrialization? Do we want to implement unified purchase and sale, planned supply, and implement the state's grain policy? Do we want to streamline organizations, tighten staffing, and improve work efficiency? Do we want to carry out construction in a planned manner according to a reasonable layout and follow unified allocation? In other words, do we want to, for the victory of the great socialist cause, firmly eliminate the old habits and bad practices of freedom and disorder, personal gain, localism, and selfishness, and actively promote the new spirit of "hard work and follow the plan"?

Our great cause will not advance smoothly. There will definitely be difficulties and struggles ahead; there will be struggles between socialist and capitalist thoughts, and there will be complex and sharp class struggles. We must arm ourselves with socialist thoughts. We must advance by overcoming difficulties. At the same time, we must be vigilant and prevent domestic and foreign enemies from sabotaging our cause.

The more our cause advances, the more the enemies will hate us, and the more vicious their sabotage will be. As Vice Premier Li Fuquan pointed out, "The victory of the people is the defeat of the people's enemies, ... the people's enemies will not willingly accept their defeat, and they will definitely use every means to sabotage our five-year plan." The recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a very important lesson for us. In the past few years, the counter-revolutionaries of the Hu Feng group have infiltrated the people's ranks, using treacherous and cunning two-faced tactics to "win people over," "connect with people," and infiltrate our "heart." In Shanghai alone, they have infiltrated more than 30 of our units and departments, causing serious harm to our people's revolution and construction cause.

The characteristics of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are also the characteristics of other hidden counter-revolutionaries. Before this conference, during our inspection of social order and judicial work in Shanghai, we saw several cases of captured counter-revolutionaries. A blood-stained former Kuomintang reactionary official used his old relationships to infiltrate the Federation of Industry and Commerce and then infiltrate the Democratic Party. A professional spy from the United States and the Kuomintang infiltrated from Taiwan and carried out long-term infiltration, disguising himself as active, infiltrating the neighborhood organization, becoming the leader of a reading group, and then becoming a radio station correspondent, further exploring information from all directions. Our mass work has been used by the enemy as a cover. Shanghai, in the past anti-revolutionary suppression movement, although it achieved some results, due to the anti-party conspiracy of Rao Shushi, protecting counter-revolutionaries, and the long-term counter-revolutionary conspiracy of Pan Hannian, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was not thorough, and the masses were not satisfied. The activities of counter-revolutionaries are now increasingly adopting covert methods, and they are particularly targeting our economic and national defense construction, which is something we must be very vigilant about.

Our complacency is very serious. Taking the Hu Feng incident as an example, some people only felt "shocked" after the third batch of materials was exposed. However, just being "shocked" is not enough. Especially for us intellectuals, we often say that we are too "bookish," retaining a lot of "liberalism"; this is on the one hand criticizing ourselves, but on the other hand, it is still excusing ourselves. Therefore, we must learn from the lessons of the Hu Feng and Pan Hannian counter-revolutionary incidents, be hundreds of times more vigilant, resolutely overcome the tendency to detach from politics, strictly criticize liberalism and complacency, and temper and transform ourselves in the complex and sharp class struggles.

Our five-year plan construction is a great cause with historical creativity. The success of our cause is not only related to the happiness of our entire nation and future generations but will also greatly strengthen the power of the world's peace and democratic camp. Our task is glorious, and our responsibility is great. Therefore, we must remember that the current imperialist encirclement still exists, the Chiang Kai-shek sellout group is still struggling to the death in Taiwan, and domestic and foreign enemies are constantly plotting to sabotage us. We cultural and educational workers must purify our ranks, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, closely unite around the Communist Party of China, with the greatest enthusiasm to participate in the construction of the motherland, and with unlimited loyalty to defend our cause. We must strive to complete and overfulfill the construction of the first five-year plan and advance towards the bright and happy goal of socialism!

ZHANG HUITING'S SPEECH

I am an old farmer, illiterate, and cannot speak well. I am nervous when I come on stage, please forgive me. Participating in this conference, after listening to the reports and group discussions, I agree with the five-year plan and various reports. Not to mention the five-year plan, even a ten-year plan, I fully support it. The five-year plan is the direction of socialism, the path of socialism. With a direction and a path, we farmers have a goal, and our spirit is even stronger! I won't talk about anything else, just talk about farmers' affairs and my own affairs:

In the old society, I worked as a long-term laborer for a lifetime. Without saying that everyone knows, people like me were not treated as human beings in the old society. It was really difficult to survive from that society. Think about it, before liberation, my family was broken and scattered; only after liberation did my family reunite, which means I had a home. In the land reform, I also received land, and then I joined the mutual aid group and the cooperative, produced more grain, and no longer worried about food and clothing. The good life that I never dreamed of in the past, I am now enjoying. These benefits did not fall from the sky, farmers know that these benefits were fought for by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Now and the past are simply incomparable. Without going too far, just talk about last year, when my family faced such a big flood and snow disaster, it was really a disaster. The water was one zhang deep on flat ground, and the snow was three chi thick. If it were during the Kuomintang's rule, there would only be two paths: either drowning or starving to death, or the whole family fleeing. Now? Facing a flood disaster that hadn't been heard of in hundreds of years, not only did no one die, but there was no need to flee. Even the oxen, the government also actively found ways, in the cold winter, in the snow that was more than three chi thick, leading us to move to places hundreds of miles away, otherwise, how would we produce this year? The government's care, even if it were said for three days and three nights, it would not be enough. We can only work hard to increase production, produce more grain, reduce the state's relief burden, and support industrialization.

Let's talk about increasing production. The first thing is to take the path of cooperativization. Our village is a cooperativized village, out of 100 households, except for four landlord households, 96 households have joined the cooperative. The cooperative members say: "After joining the cooperative, we can produce more grain, and we have a way." The second thing is to follow Chairman Mao's words and control the Huai River, making the people of the Huai River, who have suffered from disasters for generations, settle down, and reduce the suffering of "big rain, big disaster; small rain, small disaster; no rain, drought disaster." The third thing is to implement the "three changes" method proposed by our province for agricultural increase. With these three things, it is guaranteed that we can produce more grain and increase income. Just take our cooperative's production as an example, the entire cooperative's members average three mu per person, before the organization, each mu averaged only about 100 jin; after the organization, in 1952, each person averaged more than 500 jin, in 1953, each person averaged more than 900 jin, and even last year, when such a big flood disaster occurred, each person still averaged more than 700 jin. Last winter, in response to the "three changes" call, the summer harvest was expanded, and each person's small wheat income was more than 400 jin. It seems that the autumn harvest is guaranteed, and even if there is no harvest this autumn, we will not need government relief anymore. I plan that this year, each person in our cooperative will harvest more than 1,200 jin of grain, and strive for more than 1,500 jin next year to support national industrialization. In the future, when industry develops and tractors are available, we will have more confidence and guarantees. In a word, this is the correct and great leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the happiness that Chairman Mao has given us farmers.

Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

CHENG CHIAN'S SPEECH

I fully agree with the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China," Vice Premier Li Fuquan's report "On the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report "On the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," and I propose that the conference approve them and make corresponding resolutions.

In 1933, Stalin summarized the Soviet Union's first five-year plan and talked about the need to develop heavy industry with concerned and sympathetic language: "China, because it lacks its own heavy industry and its own military industry, is being trampled by all those who act arbitrarily." At the time Stalin said these words, before the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, China was in a period of deep suffering for a long time. In those years, many pioneers of the old democratic revolution, many social activists with simple patriotic thoughts, many conscientious scientific and technological workers, and many naive reformers, witnessing the weak country and poor people, all wanted to do something. Sun Yat-sen, in his famous speech, "The Three Principles of the People," said: "The people's livelihood is the most important of the three principles of the people." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood."

He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood." He also said: "The people's livelihood is the foundation of the people's livelihood."

In the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," the great plan for industrial development in China was proposed, advocating for economic construction. Many people raised the slogan of "industrial salvation," some demanded "revitalizing domestic products and resisting foreign goods," and some even supported small factories in turbulent times. However, history has shown that Sun Yat-sen's "industrial plan" could not and did not materialize, and all the naive reformist illusions were shattered by harsh realities. Why is this so? Chairman Mao pointed out succinctly: "Without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry." Now, we have such a new China, we have the prerequisites for industrial development, and therefore, we can proceed along the socialist path to begin the construction of the national economy. Reflecting on the painful lessons of history and looking forward to the bright future of socialism, we cannot but deeply appreciate the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who led the Chinese people to victory in the revolution and continue to lead the Chinese people forward toward the goal of socialism.

The first Five-Year Plan was formulated by the Chinese Communist Party based on Lenin's theory of the transitional period, the experience of building socialism in the Soviet Union, and the specific conditions of China. It is a major step in realizing the overall tasks of the state during the transitional period and a grand blueprint for the well-being of the people and the happiness of our descendants. The tasks outlined in the first Five-Year Plan indicate the socialist direction of China's national economic development. Over the next five years, the total expenditure for economic construction and cultural education nationwide will be 766.4 billion yuan, demonstrating the vast scale of China's national economic development. Over the next five years, the total industrial output value will increase by 98.3%, and the total output value of agriculture and its by-products will increase by 23.3%, indicating the relatively rapid development of China's industry and agriculture. In the next five years, the production development indicators of various economic sectors, including industry and agriculture, will pay attention to maintaining appropriate proportions and will be calculated, verified, and repeatedly balanced. This indicates that the first Five-Year Plan of China adheres to the basic law of balanced development of the national economy, and its foundation is solid and reliable. Therefore, the successful completion and over-fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan are completely assured.

The formulation of the first Five-Year Plan has paid attention to combining the plans of central ministries with local plans, concentrating the main forces under unified leadership to develop heavy industry, first ensuring the construction of key projects, and fully mobilizing local initiatives and creativity. The first Five-Year Plan has made clear regulations on the guiding principles and issues to be noted in the formulation and implementation of local plans. It is the sacred duty of local governments at all levels to correctly and concretely implement the spirit of the Five-Year Plan in local plans, so that the achievements of local plan implementation can strongly support and complement the complete realization of the unified national plan.

As for Hunan, agriculture accounts for a significant proportion of the provincial national economy. During the first Five-Year Plan period, under the guidance of the state's overall policies, efforts must be made to vigorously promote the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and to regard leading agricultural production and agricultural production cooperation as the most important and ongoing task. By this spring, Hunan has established 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives and plans to develop 45,000 agricultural production cooperatives this year. In the past two years, Hunan has suffered severe natural disasters, and the agricultural production plan has not been completed. Therefore, the agricultural production tasks in the last three years of the first Five-Year Plan will be very heavy. To achieve the state's requirements for Hunan's agricultural production in the first Five-Year Plan, we must first fight against natural disasters, especially water and drought disasters. Mountainous and hilly areas should build medium and small water conservancy projects and do water and soil conservation work. The Dongting Lake area should focus on cultivating and repairing dikes to prevent floods and drain water. The Dongting Lake area's rice production accounts for about 20% of the province's total rice production and is an important source of commercial grain in Hunan Province. Last year, the area suffered from a flood that was beyond human and material resistance, resulting in a severe reduction in rice production. To help the disaster-stricken people rebuild their homes and restore and develop agricultural production, last winter and this spring, we organized 850,000 workers and cadres to complete a massive dike repair project in the ice and snow of severe cold, ensuring that 600 million mu of good land can be safely produced at the 1949 flood level. The key repaired dikes can also guarantee that 200 million mu of land will not collapse even if they encounter the 1954 flood. However, to completely eliminate the water disasters of Dongting Lake, we must follow the national plan, combine it with the Yangtze River Basin plan, and comprehensively treat it step by step. Secondly, to increase grain production, we must plant more high-yield crops. This year, the province plans to plant 600 million mu of sweet potatoes, with a total production expected to reach 7 billion jin. Thirdly, we must lead the improvement of agricultural production technology in a planned and localized manner and develop the economy of mountainous and forested areas. Hunan Province has 5,000 local industrial units of various economic components, both large and small; individual handicraftsmen are scattered throughout the province, with great production potential. These local industries and handicrafts will continue to develop actively, adapt to the requirements of the national plan, and implement the policy of serving agricultural production. The cooperativization of handicrafts must also be promoted step by step. Hunan has more than 3,000 private industrial enterprises, with nearly 50,000 employees. Among them, processing and contracting, purchasing and packaging private industries account for 81.7% of the total industrial output value of private industries. The province has already established 105 public-private joint ventures with about 10,000 employees. The province has nearly 40,000 private commercial enterprises in nine municipal districts, of which 8,000 have been incorporated into the form of state capitalism.

The above is a very brief outline of the work situation in Hunan. Of course, our work still has many shortcomings. For example, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit and class policy have not been fully implemented; in the unified purchase and sale of grain, there are still individual regions where the assessment of production is too high or too low, and there is waste in both urban and rural grain distribution; in consolidating social order, there is still a sense of complacency in leadership thinking, and the weapons of people's democratic dictatorship have not been strongly used to give the necessary blows to counter-revolutionaries and criminal elements. To complete the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, we must resolutely overcome these shortcomings, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres, and do a better job in the future. Increasing production, practicing thrift, and opposing waste are a universal, long-term, and ongoing political task. We will further implement and execute this in practice.

The formulation and implementation of China's first Five-Year Plan have significant international implications. Our international friends cheer for our achievements. But our enemies abroad are terrified and anxious, and their hostility and enmity towards us will inevitably deepen, and their sabotage and disruption will inevitably intensify. The remnants of the reactionary class that have been eliminated domestically and the determined counter-revolutionaries in the class that will be eliminated will also carry out various more hidden and more vicious sabotage and destruction activities. The exposure of the counter-revolutionary crimes of Pan Hannian and the Hu Feng group is a clear example. Therefore, we must strengthen our national defense to safeguard the security of the motherland and economic construction; we must resolutely cleanse all hidden counter-revolutionaries from our ranks. As long as we do not relax our struggle against domestic and foreign enemies for a moment, we will be forever victorious.

Comrades! Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, let us unite the people of the whole country, work diligently, be thrifty, work hard, overcome difficulties, and strive for the successful completion and over-fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Minister Shen Yanbing**

I fully agree with the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China" proposed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and approved by the State Council. I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen to the conference.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will significantly increase China's industrial and agricultural production value and the socialist economic component, marking China's progress toward the great goal of socialist industrialization and the further consolidation of people's democratic dictatorship, and the further improvement of the people's material and cultural life. We, the cultural and artistic workers, enthusiastically support this draft plan and are determined to strive for its realization.

However, we must not overlook our environment and must not overlook the fact that there are still internal and external class enemies around us and enemies of peace. These enemies who hate the Chinese people, hate China's socialist construction, and hate peace and democracy will not be willing to see any step forward in China's socialist construction and will inevitably try to obstruct and sabotage it in every way. Therefore, we must not imagine that China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will be realized smoothly and peacefully without serious struggles; on the contrary, the process of realizing the first Five-Year Plan will necessarily be a process of serious class struggle. Moreover, as the construction and transformation of socialism progress, class struggle will inevitably deepen, become more complex and acute; the enemy's sabotage activities will become more cunning and vicious. They will not only intensify open sabotage activities but will also use more disguised, hidden, and two-faced methods to infiltrate the people's ranks and sabotage our construction from the political, economic, military, and ideological fronts, corrupting the people's fighting will and affecting the people's belief in the inevitability of the success of the socialist cause. The recently exposed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a prominent example of this type of counter-revolutionary enemy.

From the materials that have been exposed, this Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been consistently opposing and resisting the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolutionary cause led by the Chinese Communist Party since before the liberation of the whole country, spreading various reactionary speeches, maliciously attacking Marxism-Leninism, defaming and cursing the cultural policies and literary policies of the Chinese Communist Party, defaming and cursing all progressive writers, attempting to weaken the influence of Marxism-Leninism, obstructing progressive intellectuals and young students from approaching the actual revolutionary struggle; and after the liberation of the whole country, they have been madly hating the victory of the people's revolution, hating the people's democratic dictatorship and everything new in society, using various conspiratorial means to "recruit people," "connect people," expanding their counter-revolutionary organizations, sending members of their group in various disguises to infiltrate the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, state organs, people's organizations, enterprises, schools, and establish counter-revolutionary activity bases, systematically spreading their counter-revolutionary theories, expanding their counter-revolutionary ideological influence, attempting to overthrow the People's Republic of China, and restore the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang in China. This counter-revolutionary group, in October 1954, took advantage of the criticism of bourgeois ideology launched in the academic and cultural circles, publicly put forward their counter-revolutionary program, and launched a ferocious attack on the entire revolutionary ideological front. It was precisely in this attack that the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, which had been disguised as supporting the revolution but actually opposing the revolution, disguised as supporting the people but actually opposing the people, disguised as supporting the Chinese Communist Party but actually opposing the Chinese Communist Party, was exposed to the people.

The concentrated expression of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary group's attack on the revolution, the Chinese Communist Party, and the people is the notorious "Opinions on Literary Issues." In this opinion paper, Hu Feng slandered the party's requirements for writers to study Marxism, deepen their contact with workers, peasants, and soldiers, reform their non-proletarian ideology, critically inherit and develop national traditions, and actively serve politics as "five knives stuck in the heads of writers and readers," and maliciously slandered the party's leadership of the literary circles as "sectarianism" and "military rule." They further put forward their own six counter-revolutionary programs, which are: opposing writers mastering the communist worldview, opposing writers combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposing writers reforming their ideology, opposing the use of national forms in literature, opposing literature serving the current political struggle, and finally suggesting the dissolution of the unified organization of the literary circles, which actually means to abolish the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The thrust of these six counter-revolutionary programs is not only directed at literary issues but also aimed at the entire socialist cause of our country. Because studying Marxism-Leninism, reforming one's non-proletarian ideology, combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, respecting one's own national traditions, actively serving the current political struggle, and following the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is not only completely necessary for writers but also completely necessary for all intellectuals, cadres, and people of our country. Without these six points or not acting according to these six points, what would it mean? It would mean that all our writers, intellectuals, and cadres would become a group of art-for-art's-sake people, a group of bureaucrats, a group of shortsighted mediocrities, and a group of fragmented liberals, detached from politics, detached from reality, detached from the masses, detached from their own national traditions, and detached from the leadership of the party and the government. From this, it can be seen that the intention of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group's counter-revolutionary program is extremely sinister, aiming to disarm us ideologically and abolish the two highest principles announced by Chairman Mao in the opening speech of the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party," and "The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." Therefore, the problem is clear: the so-called "Opinions on Literary Issues" is just a cover for these counter-revolutionaries to open a gap from here to realize their entire set of anti-socialist counter-revolutionary programs. The counter-revolutionary theories advocated in this "Opinions on Literary Issues" undoubtedly have great harm to the socialist revolutionary cause. The harm lies especially in the fact that many basic points of this counter-revolutionary program have been systematically propagated by members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group long before the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was exposed; the "Opinions on Literary Issues" is just a concentrated expression of these reactionary points. Therefore, while vigorously exposing and eliminating the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we must resolutely, systematically, and deeply criticize and refute these reactionary thoughts.

As a cultural worker, I deeply feel that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident has special and profound educational significance for us in the cultural and artistic circles. The reactionary speeches and actions of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were not unnoticed and unopposed in our cultural and artistic circles in the past, but we only regarded this as a simple literary ideological issue, a personal ideological quality issue, and at most as an issue of a small clique of personal ambition in the literary circles, and did not sharply regard it as a political issue to be seriously and earnestly pursued. This shows how insensitive our political sense is and how numb our thoughts have been. This political complacency naturally opens up great convenience for Hu Feng elements and all other hidden counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, it is also clear that our cultural front still has serious weaknesses in ideology. For example, in the cultural and artistic departments, non-political tendencies, detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, and contempt for national cultural and artistic traditions are widespread and serious. They are manifested in: many cultural and artistic workers are not active or unwilling to serve the current political tasks, do not reflect the current complex and acute class struggle, lose vigilance in the face of class enemies, do not care about domestic and international affairs, do not care about the lives of the masses; they emphasize the special nature of literature one-sidedly, do not ask about politics, do not respect the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, do not study or delve into the theories of Marxism-Leninism and the policies of the party and the state; they despise popularization and folk work, are not willing to create literary and artistic works that are urgently needed and liked by the broad masses, are not willing to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers, or go to the masses to learn and temper themselves, are not active or willing to guide the literary and artistic activities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not attach importance to cultivating literary and artistic talents from workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not attach importance to cultural centers, libraries, and other mass cultural work, do not attach importance to the publication and distribution of popular literature; they despise national and folk cultural and artistic heritage, blindly worship Western bourgeois literature, do not attach importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, etc. All these bourgeois ideas greatly hinder the implementation of the policy of serving socialist construction and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are often used by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and other hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Cultural work is an important component of the ideological front. The current task of cultural work is to use socialist ideology to educate and inspire the people to struggle for the construction of a socialist society. To accomplish this task, we must first vigorously develop literary and artistic creation with correct ideological content and a certain artistic level, especially to vigorously develop literary and artistic works that are needed by the people and suitable for the level of the people, and liked by the people; and through various means to widely popularize the achievements of literary and artistic creation among the people, to continuously consolidate and expand the position of socialist ideology, resist and weaken the infiltration of bourgeois ideology into the people. To accomplish this task well, we must have a cultural team that is pure and sound in ideology, politics, and organization. Therefore, the primary task of current cultural and artistic work is to strive to rectify, strengthen, and build our team in ideology, politics, and organization.

All progressive and revolutionary cultural and artistic workers should draw profound lessons from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, actively participate in the current struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and other hidden counter-revolutionaries, and in this struggle, greatly improve our political level and political vigilance, and be more united, expel all counter-revolutionaries hidden in the cultural team, and purify our team. At the same time, we should continue to deeply and meticulously criticize the reactionary thoughts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, criticize all forms of bourgeois erroneous thoughts with idealist worldviews as the core, to continuously improve our ideological level, improve the combativeness and ideological nature of cultural work, so as to better serve the national socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

Comrades! The struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and other hidden counter-revolutionaries is a very serious and tense struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our transitional period, a struggle that permeates all fronts of our socialist construction. Every revolutionary worker and every revolutionary people cannot stand aside from this struggle. We should redouble our political vigilance, thoroughly and cleanly cleanse all counter-revolutionaries who oppose the socialist revolution, oppose people's democratic dictatorship, and oppose socialist industrialization and socialist transformation from our ranks, to ensure the successful realization of China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. We firmly believe that we will definitely accomplish this task.

Comrades! Our country, in the past few years, has not only achieved batch after batch of victories in domestic construction but has also made significant contributions to the sacred cause of defending Asian and world peace. The recent World Peace Conference held in Helsinki has powerfully demonstrated the unprecedented strength and unity of the forces of world peace. This conference has powerfully demonstrated that although the views and beliefs of the peoples of various countries are different, in the desire to defend peace, prevent war, and strive for further easing of international tensions, they are completely consistent. This consistency is reflected in the various documents and declarations unanimously adopted at this conference. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the documents and declarations adopted by the World Peace Conference and are willing to make sincere efforts to achieve the goals listed therein. The best and most practical manifestation of this effort is that we should work diligently, overcome difficulties, increase production, practice thrift, and successfully complete and over-fulfill China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, with our great peaceful labor to strengthen the struggle to defend world peace. Revolution will definitely defeat counter-revolution! Peace will definitely defeat war!

**Speech by Representative Li Tao**

I fully agree with the State Council's proposal to the conference on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, which aims to establish the initial foundation for national socialist industrialization, the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and the foundation for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, is a grand blueprint and a major step to realize the overall tasks of the state during the transitional period. The successful realization of this great plan will greatly change the economic face of our country. Our original industrial base is very weak. Everyone knows that without the development of heavy industry, it is impossible to have the overall development of the national economy, there will be no solid national defense, and the people's living standards will not be improved. Therefore, the first Five-Year Plan, which takes the development of heavy industry as the center, is indeed a reflection of the will of the people of the whole country, representing the current and long-term interests of the people of the whole country. I suggest that the conference adopt it as the overall goal for the people of the whole country to strive for.

According to the provisions of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, during the first Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to establish the Northeast industrial base with Anshan steel industry as the center. The state's investment in basic construction in Liaoning Province is very large, and there are many new and expanded key projects. The current industrial production tasks are very heavy. The primary task of the people of Liaoning Province during the first Five-Year Plan period is to ensure the quality, low cost, and timely completion of these key projects and to put them into production on time. At the same time, we must give full play to the role of existing industries, actively produce, and strive to increase new varieties, improve quality, reduce costs, and provide more and better industrial products for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives; we must also manufacture new equipment for the newly built factories and mines, cultivate technical personnel and workers, and accumulate construction funds for the state. Therefore, Liaoning Province bears a heavy but glorious task in implementing the state's first Five-Year Plan. We deeply feel the great responsibility. However, due to our low leadership level, our leadership ability does not match the new tasks, and there are many and serious shortcomings and errors in our work. For example, in industrial and mining enterprises, political and ideological work is still very weak, and capitalist management ideas are still quite serious; many units do not fully and evenly complete the state plan; the most serious is the existence of serious waste phenomena in basic construction, industrial production, and other departments. These serious waste phenomena have already caused some losses to the state's socialist construction.

To ensure the completion of the state's first Five-Year Plan, we must respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, organize and mobilize the working class and all laboring people of the whole province to launch a comprehensive production and savings movement on the economic construction front and all other fronts. In the comprehensive production and savings movement, we must comprehensively implement the state's policies and guidelines, comprehensively improve leadership, especially strengthen political and ideological leadership, comprehensively improve enterprise management, and comprehensively complete the state plan as the overall requirement.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the various levels of the Communist Party of China in Liaoning Province and the people's committees at various levels have actively organized and led the development of the production and savings movement. In the party representative conferences held in May and June, according to the overall requirements of the state, combined with the current specific situation of Liaoning Province, we studied and proposed specific requirements and measures for action to ensure the completion of the state's Five-Year Plan and to launch the production and savings movement, and made arrangements. The administrative, trade union, and youth league organizations of various enterprises have carried out in-depth mobilization of the masses to discuss and formulate production and savings plans and organize the implementation of production and savings plans. Up to now, the production and savings movement has been initially launched throughout the province and has achieved initial results. For example, in basic construction, through the resolute reduction of non-production construction investment, the reduction of construction standards, and the reduction of production construction costs under the condition of ensuring production needs, according to the preliminary statistics of Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Fuxin, a total of 106.34 million yuan can be saved. In urban construction, under the condition of fully utilizing existing equipment, adhering to the spirit of distinguishing between urgency and non-urgency and gradually carrying out various public utilities, according to the preliminary statistics of Shenyang, Dalian, and other seven cities, a total of 43.1 million yuan can be saved for the state for public utilities investment. In state-owned and local state-owned industrial production, through increasing production, saving raw materials, using substitute raw materials, improving recovery rates, reducing waste and product accumulation, and improving management, according to the incomplete statistics of 50 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Yingkou, a total of 610 million yuan can be saved. In agricultural production, through the development of paddy fields, the planting of high-yield crops, and the strengthening and improvement of technology, a total of 300 million jin of grain can be increased this year. In state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises, through the strengthening of planning, the establishment and improvement of material responsibility systems, the improvement of commodity inspection, transportation, and storage work, and the reduction of commodity turnover costs and commodity loss rates, a total of 190 million yuan can be saved for the state. In grain work, through the timely analysis and handling of those who make a fuss about grain supply in cities, the implementation of grain pre-budgeting systems in institutions, enterprises, schools, and the army, the thorough implementation of evaluation and sales work in rural areas, and the strengthening and improvement of grain processing, storage, and transportation work, the reduction of loss and waste, and the improvement of milling rates, a total of 600 million jin of grain can be saved on the basis of reducing the 600 million jin quota to ensure reasonable supply. For various institutions, organizations, enterprises, and schools, we have begun to implement the spirit of the central instructions to streamline organizations, reduce levels, tighten personnel arrangements, and improve living management systems, thereby initially improving work styles, improving work efficiency, and reducing waste phenomena. In addition, the production and savings movement in transportation, public security, education, health, and other departments has also achieved some results. All of this proves that the thrift and anti-waste proposed in the Five-Year Plan are completely correct, and the potential for production and savings is very great. If this work is made a regular practice, more funds can be accumulated for the state to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan. However, since this movement is still in its initial stage, the movement has not been fully and deeply carried out, and there are still many shortcomings in the movement. All of these need to be further strengthened and improved. Our task is to, on the basis of the current situation, further rely on and mobilize the masses to carry out the production and savings movement in depth to ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the state. Liaoning Province is one of the key areas of national industrial construction and is also on the front line of national defense. The enemy's sabotage activities have been rampant for several years. Therefore, while carrying out socialist construction, we must redouble our vigilance, strengthen the struggle against all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and cleanse all hidden counter-revolutionaries to ensure the consolidation of socialist construction and national defense. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the inspiration of the Five-Year Plan decided by this conference, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, relying on the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, China's first Five-Year Plan will definitely be successfully completed.

**Speech by Representative Yu Yanan**

The first Five-Year Plan, which is about to be adopted by this conference and focuses on socialist industrialization with the development of heavy industry as the key, is a great and correct plan for the development of the national economy. It is a plan that represents the long-term and fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. I fully support it. I come from Anhui Province, where agriculture is the main economic sector. From the perspective of the locality, we must give full play to the potential of the local economy and the enthusiasm of the peasants for production to fully meet the needs of industrial development and the needs of the peasants themselves. Therefore, I believe that the people of Anhui will, like the people of the whole country, spare no effort to actively support the construction of national industrialization.

Anhui is a province that has suffered from disasters for a long time. Since liberation, in addition to completing various tasks like other places in the country, the people of Anhui have also had to use their greatest strength to overcome various natural disasters. In the future, how to work according to the overall tasks of the state in the transitional period, combined with the characteristics of Anhui's frequent disasters, especially to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the agricultural production plan, is the most urgent task for the people of Anhui in completing the first Five-Year Plan. Therefore, I would like to focus on talking about Anhui's production and disaster relief work over the past year. Last year was the year with the most severe disasters since Anhui's liberation. In the summer, a flood that had not been seen in a hundred years occurred; in the autumn, there was a drought for more than two months; in the winter, there was continuous heavy snow for ten days and nights, with snow accumulation of more than three feet in the fields; this spring, due to the frequent rain, there were four consecutive hailstorms in some areas, and the spring famine situation once expanded. Summer floods, autumn droughts, winter snow, and spring famine are the four most severe challenges in production and disaster relief over the past year.

To overcome natural disasters, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anhui Provincial People's Government led the people of the whole province to first carry out extremely tense and arduous flood control and rescue work. On the banks of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, an unprecedented number of manpower, material resources, and financial resources were mobilized; just in terms of manpower, more than 200,000 cadres, workers, and soldiers were deployed. After the flood, water drainage, plugging of breaches, and the reconstruction of dikes and agricultural water conservancy projects were carried out. The total amount of soil moved in the winter and spring repairs was 19.7 billion cubic meters.

Secondly, efforts were made to focus on agricultural production, especially grain production. The whole province launched a late autumn replanting movement to make up for the losses caused by the flood. Although the disaster was particularly severe last year, grain production still exceeded that of previous disaster years. The area of winter crops was also expanded, increasing the area of summer grain crops to 55 million mu, an increase of 8.1 million mu compared to last year; the summer grain harvest increased by 1.4 billion jin compared to last year. The development of sideline production and the strengthening of disaster relief work also greatly reduced the severity of the disaster.

Thirdly, a large-scale relief work was carried out. The total amount of disaster relief funds allocated by the central government reached 104.62 million yuan, used to distribute relief grain worth 60.1 million yuan, distribute 836,800 pieces of cotton clothing, relocate and resettle 5.05 million disaster victims, rebuild 1,863,200 houses for disaster victims, and organize 10,600 Chinese and Western doctors to treat them; disaster victims were particularly grateful that the government built three floating bridges on the Huai River in the cold winter and snowy weather to help disaster victims move cattle from the snow to non-disaster areas hundreds of miles away for grazing. Due to all these efforts, the people of Anhui basically overcame the difficulties of the disaster and achieved the requirement of disaster relief without starvation. This achievement is inseparable from the correct leadership of the central government and the strong support of the people of the whole country. Here, I, on behalf of the people of Anhui, express my deepest gratitude to the central government and the people of the whole country for their concern and support! The support and warmth given to us by the central government and the people of the whole country will further inspire our confidence and tirelessly overcome all disasters to gradually and completely free our great motherland from various natural disasters.

To push forward our construction cause successfully, we must fully realize the first Five-Year Plan to ensure the complete realization of the first Five-Year Plan. To ensure the complete realization of the first Five-Year Plan, we must further improve our work style, strive to overcome the various shortcomings and errors in our work. Taking Anhui as an example, as far as I know, although production and disaster relief, "three changes" work, and other work have achieved great results, there are still many shortcomings and errors. In terms of production and disaster relief, the tendency to rely solely on relief has not been completely overcome; in disaster relief work, there are still phenomena of being lax at times and tight at times; some areas pay attention to severely disaster-stricken areas but pay less attention to lightly disaster-stricken areas, resulting in some lightly disaster-stricken areas turning into severely disaster-stricken areas, adding many difficulties to the work. In terms of the unified purchase and sale of grain, there are still some abnormal phenomena in some areas. For those who make a fuss about grain supply, timely analysis and handling are not done well, resulting in the waste of grain. In fact, in non-disaster areas, the truly grain-deficient are very few, and the majority are false shouters. For example, in Yixian County, four townships had 62 households shouting for grain, and every day they went to the cadres to make a fuss about the supply. After an on-the-spot inspection, only five households were truly grain-deficient, and 92% were false shouters. In Shouxian County, Diaoqiao District, Sanwei Selection District, three rich peasants who led the fuss about grain supply in March said they were in dire straits and would starve to death. After an inspection, the three rich peasant households with 22 people still had 2,034 jin of wheat, and each person had an average of 92 jin, not only enough to eat but also surplus. Next, in terms of basic construction and administrative expenditure, some waste phenomena have also been found. For example, in basic construction, the safety factor is blindly increased, the construction cost is overestimated, and the practice of wide use and narrow use is also present. In terms of public security, there is still a serious sense of complacency among the cadres at present, and timely and powerful blows have not been given to the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, resulting in the increasingly rampant activities of counter-revolutionaries. These counter-revolutionaries have some developed spy organizations and plotted uprisings; some sabotaged national economic construction and mutual aid cooperative organizations; some spread rumors, shook people's hearts, even carried out assassinations and poisoning, incited the masses, and created disturbances. Last year, there were 140 assassination incidents, killing and injuring 150 of our cadres and activists. It can be seen that the enemy is always trying to sabotage our revolutionary cause, and we must heighten our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, and resolutely cleanse all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries. All of this shows that now, more than ever, we need to carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose the shortcomings in our work, and closely connect with the masses, accept the supervision of the masses. I believe this is a powerful guarantee for the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

Comrades! The Chinese Communist Party has led us to victory in the revolution, and in the future, it will also lead us to fully realize the first Five-Year Plan. After several Five-Year Plans, we will build our country into a highly industrialized socialist society, so that our descendants will forever live a happy life. Therefore, I have the same trust and loyalty to the first Five-Year Plan as I do to the Chinese Communist Party. I will spare no effort, under the leadership of the party and the government, to strive for the full realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Representative Ma Yanhong**

I fully support the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and am also very excited and moved in my heart. This plan specifically explains the great and glorious future of our country and the happiness of the people's future life. From the small group discussions and studies, I deeply feel that this plan has been carefully studied and has scientific statistical basis. However, at the same time, I also deeply feel that to complete this great plan is a major and arduous task.

The party and the government are leading us in the forefront, and we, the people of the whole country, should concentrate our strength under the leadership of the party and the government to strive for the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

The health of the people is an important basic force in economic construction. In the past few years, the health level of the people has made significant progress and improvement. However, from the situation of the development of all the construction of the country, the health work is still relatively backward. For example: in colleges and universities, tuberculosis has not been eliminated; the number of patients with neurasthenia and insomnia is still considerable; because of poor health and weak resistance, there are still many people suffering from colds and headaches. Health is not just about a person having no diseases, but also having enduring labor power. For example, we work eight hours a day and can complete the work without feeling tired. If we need to work overtime, at this time, some people can stand it; some people cannot stand it. If one is not healthy, one does not have enough energy, which will affect the work.

A healthy person is always full of spirit, full of energy, cheerful, optimistic, loves work, works hard, is not afraid of difficulties, does not retreat, is brave to overcome difficulties, always advances, and strives for an ideal life.

Comrades must ask, how to get health? Chairman Mao has long instructed us: develop sports, strengthen the people's physique. As long as we engage in sports activities all the time, our health will be improved and strengthened. Physiology has proven that engaging in sports will make the organs and tissues of the body exercise and develop, strong and powerful, otherwise they will decline and become weak and powerless.

Chairman Mao's instructions are correct and scientific. To strengthen the physique and gain health, physical exercise is an important measure. There are many ways to exercise the body. Here I would like to introduce the Labor and Defense Sports Movement. This is also an advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which has played a great role in promoting mass sports and improving the health level of the people, and is a superior system. In our country, this movement has been promoted and carried out, and young people across the country have enthusiastically participated in this movement.

Due to the development of sports, it has played a great role in increasing production and saving. For example, the magazine "New Sports" has reported that due to the development of sports such as calisthenics in factories and mines, the health of the workers has been improved, the sick rate has been reduced, the attendance rate has been increased, and the work efficiency of individuals has been improved. This is a powerful proof that the development of sports, the improvement of health level, and the achievement of the goal of increasing production and saving.

In short, while implementing the first Five-Year Plan, we should also pay attention to the improvement of the health level of the people. To strengthen the physique and improve health, relying solely on the development of sports is not enough to achieve the goal, and we must also do some work in hygiene and medicine. For example, the previous patriotic hygiene movement basically eliminated flies, which is a great achievement and has a good impact on people's health. To strengthen the physique and health of the people, the departments of hygiene, medicine, and sports should formulate specific plans to ensure the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. In particular, I hope that the leaders of various institutions, factories, and schools will give correct leadership and support to the health issue.

**Speech by Vice Premier and Chairman of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Ulanfu**

I fully agree with the draft of China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui to the conference.

The first Five-Year Plan is a major step in realizing the overall tasks of the state during the transitional period. Its realization will push China toward the goal of a socialist society and will also promote the further development of political, economic, and cultural construction in various minority nationalities in China.

In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government have carried out a series of work in various minority nationalities to implement national equality, strengthen national unity, implement regional autonomy for nationalities, cultivate national cadres, and develop the economy and culture, achieving great results.

So far, China has established 72 autonomous regions for nationalities, including 45 autonomous counties, 27 autonomous prefectures, and autonomous regions. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be established soon, and the preparatory committee for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region is also being established; these two major events mark that China's policy of implementing regional autonomy for nationalities has achieved new and major successes.

In recent years, the economy and culture of various minority nationality regions have developed to a considerable extent and have strongly supported the socialist construction of the motherland. In agriculture, the production of grain and technical crops in various minority nationality regions has generally increased. According to statistics from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Xinjiang Province, the grain production in 1954 reached 17.7 billion jin, an increase of 16.9% compared to 1952. In animal husbandry, according to statistics from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Province, and Qinghai Province, the number of various livestock in 1954 was 48.7 million, an increase of 30.2% compared to 1952. Other minority nationality pastoral areas have also increased the number of livestock. In trade, according to incomplete statistics, in 1954, the number of state-owned commercial institutions in all minority nationality regions in the country was 2,340, an increase of 178% compared to 1951; the total purchase value reached 817 million yuan, an increase of 512% compared to 1951; the total sales value reached 11,260 million yuan, an increase of 478% compared to 1951. In transportation, the total length of highways that have been built and are being built in all minority nationality regions in the country is more than 10,000 kilometers, with a total investment of 219 million yuan from the central government. The local industry of minority nationality regions is also gradually developing, and many places that did not have industry in the past have begun to see the emergence of industry. In culture and education, in 1954, the total number of schools at all levels in all minority nationality regions in the country was 26,000, with a total of 266.1 million students, an increase of 70% compared to 1952. In 1954, the number of new books published in minority nationalities' languages reached 835, with a total of 8.73 million copies. In medical and health care, in 1954, the total number of comprehensive hospitals in minority nationality regions was 65, with 4,600 beds, an increase of 94% compared to 1953. In the cultivation of cadres, the central and local governments have jointly established 7 ethnic institutes, and the number of minority nationality cadres cultivated in schools and at work has reached more than 100,000.

China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy embodies the long-term and highest interests of the people of all nationalities in China. In the first Five-Year Plan, some major construction projects, such as the steel enterprises in Baotou, the non-ferrous metal industry and the petroleum industry in Xinjiang, the Lanxin Railway, and the Jitong Railway, are distributed in minority nationality regions. These large-scale constructions are rapidly changing the social and economic landscape of the local areas, bringing great benefits to the people of the whole country and the local people of all nationalities. Therefore, the local people of all nationalities should make every effort to support these constructions. However, in the first Five-Year Plan period, not all minority nationality regions will have such major constructions. This is because major constructions not only require a large amount of funds and technical strength, require scientific data on resource conditions, but also must have many other conditions that can be carried out now. In our country, especially in many of our minority nationality regions, these conditions are not yet fully possessed. Therefore, we can and should only carry out key constructions, and we must not, regardless of the conditions, disperse funds and technical strength to attempt so-called "industrialization everywhere," otherwise it will bring great difficulties and losses to the socialist construction of our country. All major construction projects in the Five-Year Plan, no matter where they are distributed, are the common wealth of the people of all nationalities in our country and the foundation for the prosperity and happiness of the people of all nationalities. The minority nationality regions of our country are generally rich in resources. According to the principle of appropriately distributing industrial production forces in the country, making industry close to the areas of raw materials, fuel, and consumption, and making the distribution of industry suitable for the conditions of consolidating national defense, gradually improving the economic level of backward regions, etc., it can be predicted that after the state has laid a certain foundation for heavy industry construction, the state will have the possibility and will definitely carry out more industrial construction in minority nationality regions. At that time, the speed of industrial development in various minority nationality regions will definitely not be slow but very fast. As for some minority nationality regions that do not have the necessary conditions and are not suitable for the development of industry, according to the plan for the coordinated development of various sectors of the national economy, the state will definitely pay attention to the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other production in those regions. In the Five-Year Plan, there are appropriate regulations for the construction of local industry in minority nationality regions, for the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry production, and for the development of cultural education, medical and health care, etc. It can be seen that the first Five-Year Plan fully considers the needs of construction in all minority nationality regions in the country.

The people of all nationalities in our country, under the guidance of the great Five-Year Plan, should fully give play to their initiative, work hard, and support the construction of the motherland, and build their own national places in the construction of our great motherland. Some minority nationality regions have done relatively little in economic and cultural construction since liberation, and in the latter part of the Five-Year Plan, we should try to do more of the most urgent construction projects and try to do them well. The relevant higher-level local state organs should give more care and help in these aspects.

Some minority nationality regions that have not yet completed democratic reforms need to reform some old systems within the nationality for construction, because if democratic reforms are not carried out for a long time, it will be difficult to develop the economy and culture of the nationality. Some regions have gradually and steadily carried out various reforms under the will of the people and the public figures who have contact with the people, which is very good. In the future, the democratic reform of minority nationality regions must be carried out according to the different historical conditions of various minority nationalities, according to the will of the people and the public figures who have contact with the people, gradually and steadily. At the same time, it is hoped that the public figures of these nationality regions will continue to study hard, strive to progress, unite with the people of their own nationality, and take an active and positive attitude towards the necessary reforms of some old systems.

To successfully complete the Five-Year Plan and strengthen the construction work in minority nationality regions, we must actively respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council to oppose waste and practice thrift, and seriously and resolutely implement the central government's various regulations on opposing extravagance and waste and comprehensive thrift. The people of all nationalities must know that to build our places, the help of the state is necessary and indispensable; but we must also work hard and thriftily, otherwise it is impossible. At present, there are still phenomena of extravagance and waste among some people of minority nationalities, and there are also some regions where there are some customs that are not conducive to the development of production, which should be gradually changed on the basis of improving the awareness of the masses.

Now, various hidden and open counter-revolutionaries are still trying to sabotage the unity of our great motherland and the unity of all nationalities and sabotage our various construction projects. From the exposure of the counter-revolutionary incidents of Pan Hannian and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we must draw profound lessons. To more reliably realize the Five-Year Plan, we must educate cadres and the people, heighten vigilance, strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries.

In recent years, the great achievements of the socialist construction of our motherland, including the political, economic, and cultural development of various minority nationality regions, have been achieved on the basis of the continuous strengthening of mutual trust and unity among various nationalities. However, we must know that the remnants of great nationalism and local nationalism still exist to varying degrees, and it will take a long time to completely eliminate this nationalism and its remnants. The close unity of various nationalities is an important condition for building socialism in our country. To realize China's first Five-Year Plan, we must continue to strengthen the unity and brotherly friendship among various nationalities unremittingly.

After Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Five-Year Plan was published, the people of all nationalities in the country unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support and expressed their determination to realize this great plan. In the first two years of the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the people of all nationalities have shown their will in practice. I believe that the people of all nationalities in the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will be even more closely united in the future to strive for the realization of China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy!

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    林铁代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、并热烈拥护第一个五年计划的实施，我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”、彭真副委员长关于“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”以及邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是根据我国宪法所明确规定的国家过渡时期的总任务提出的，是实现总任务的一个有决定意义的重大步骤。毫无疑义，这一伟大计划的实现，将使我国国民经济的面貌发生重大的变化，为我国由落后的农业国变成先进的社会主义工业国奠定初步的基础。我完全相信：在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，经过全国人民一致和艰苦的努力，我们一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划中所规定的各项光荣而巨大的任务。
    正如李富春副总理在报告中指出的，为了建立我国社会主义的强大的物质基础，我们必须集中力量发展工业特别是优先发展重工业，同时相应地发展农业，这是完全正确的，我坚决拥护。发展农业是保证工业发展和保证全部经济计划完成的基本条件。在第一个五年计划里关于发展农业的要求、发展农业的道路以及实现农业生产计划的各项措施，我认为都是完全正确的。所规定的各项计划指标既根据了国家和人民的必需要求，又考虑到了实现这一计划的可能条件。因此，它是积极的，也是建立在可靠的基础上的。在这里，我想就河北省如何实现国家第一个五年计划中关于粮食棉花增产的计划，提出如下意见。
    根据国家第一个五年计划的要求，到一九五七年，河北省粮食作物种植面积要达到一亿二千五百四十万零八千亩，总产量一百八十一亿六千六百万斤，亩产一百五十点五五斤；比一九五二年（六年来丰收最大的一年）总产量增加百分之一点六九，单位面积产量增加百分之四点九八。棉花种植面积到一九五七年要达到一千八百八十六万亩，总产量七亿四千三百五十五万斤，亩产三十九斤；比一九五二年总产量增加百分之二十七点一一，单位面积产量增加百分之二点六。这个要求是符合河北省实际情况的。河北省的粮食历来是产不足用的，每年都需要中央从各地调入大批粮食支持我们；同时工业原料作物面积的比重又很大，只是棉花即约占全国总产量的四分之一，它在支持国家工业化的事业上作用很大。因此，完成和超额完成上述粮棉增产任务，对于国家建设是有重大意义的。为完成这个任务，我想应该采取以下几项主要的措施：
    第一、在办好现有农业生产合作社的基础上，积极稳步地进一步发展农业互助合作运动。我省农业生产合作社现有九万八千多个，入社农户二百七十万户，约占总农户的百分之三十五。在今后三年内，在办好现有近十万个农业生产合作社的基础上进行适当的发展。计划在今后三年内再发展总户数的百分之二十五左右，即到一九五七年入社农户要占到总农户的百分之六十。这样，不仅会给我省农业社会主义改造打下相当大的基础，而且对我省完成粮棉增产任务提供了有力的保证。
    第二、治理河流，兴办农田水利，大力进行防洪、防涝、防旱。我省由于河流多，且雨量集中，河上游地势倾斜，河下游河道狭隘，宣泄不畅。因此，历年都要遭受水灾。六年来，洪泛、沥水淹地共计一亿二千余万亩，平均每年淹地二千一百万亩。仅一九五四年因水灾而遭受的损失，就减产粮食三十八亿余斤、皮棉一亿余斤。除一九五二年因水灾特轻，仅淹地一百二十余万亩而获得了丰收以外，几年来都因遭受水灾而没有完成农业生产计划。为改变这一情况，根据“治标治本相结合，防洪排涝并重”的方针，应从流域规划入手，加强河流治理，逐步实现根治洪水的治本工程。根据综合开发水利的方针，要求在第一个五年计划末期首先开始子牙河系的滹沱河的治本工程。同时广泛开展群众性的蓄水排水工程，作好防汛工作，保证在一般洪水位时各河流不致溃决。另外，必须按照“利用自然，改造自然，变水患为水利”的精神，积极稳步地进行低洼地区的生产改革。今年我省在天津专区，结合兴建蓄水、排水工程，试办低洼地区的避灾改种工作，已完成二百一十万亩，获得了良好的效果。只就改种七万多亩马铃薯来说，就已经收获了一亿数千万斤。群众很高兴，并坚定了改种信心。全省约有一千八百多万亩易涝地区如能因地制宜地进行避灾改种，把晚熟作物变成早熟作物，把积水区变为生产区，就可能增产七、八亿斤粮食。当然，这需要经过较长时期的艰巨工作才能够实现，我们计划到一九五七年在低洼易涝地区完成改种土地达一千万亩。
    河北人民热烈拥护关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划。这一伟大计划的实现，不仅将使河北人民几千年来，因黄河的改道和决口而遭受的损害，永远地一去不复返，而且变水害为水利，在第一期水利开发计划实现后，河北省可扩大灌溉土地四百万亩，每年可增产粮食数亿斤。河北省人民为了自身的利益和全国人民的利益，一定积极地为实现这一根治和开发黄河的伟大计划而努力。
    第三、扩大高产作物种植面积，提高土地利用率。今年我省计划增植高产作物二百八十万亩，使全省高产作物面积达到三千二百余万亩，占粮食作物面积的百分之二十六点五。到一九五七年，全省高产作物面积要达到三千八百余万亩，占粮食作物面积百分之三十一强。这一计划实现后，在正常年景下约可增产粮食七亿多斤。这对改变我省缺粮情况将起重大的作用。提高土地利用率的主要方法是扩大小麦种植面积。我省宜于小麦生长的土地约有五千三百余万亩，其中约有四千余万亩可复种。历年来我省小麦种植面积约占宜麦土地的百分之六十。我们计划到一九五七年，全省小麦播种面积达到三千八百万亩，即可增加复种面积四百余万亩，可增产粮食两亿斤。另外，我省约有七百万亩荒地，经过积极地有计划地开垦，也会增产一批粮食。
    第四、继续改进和加强对农业生产的领导，这是实现农业增产计划有决定意义的一环。几年来，我省各级党政机关对农业生产的领导，虽然有所改进并不断加强，但是领导工作上的官僚主义和主观主义还是相当严重的。这主要表现在领导上的一般化，对各地实际情况缺乏周密的调查研究，缺乏深入的检查和具体的帮助。今后为了加强对农业的领导，除必须坚决执行中央所指示的从省到乡各级党委和政府均必须以领导农业生产和农业互助合作运动为工作的重点以外，必须反对官僚主义的作风而采取具体的深入的工作方法，必须反对命令主义的方法而采取群众路线的方法。为了加强对农业生产的领导，还必须精简上层领导机关，充实下层。我省省级行政编制，初步计划约可精简编制人员的百分之二十至三十。另外，我们计划从现有干部中抽出一万一千多人派到乡里去，作为县、区的驻乡指导员。这样作不仅可以加强下层的领导力量，而且可以帮助克服领导机关的官僚主义和文牍主义，提高工作效率。
    最后，我愿意表示，我们将尽一切努力，动员全省人民，为坚决完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划的伟大任务而奋斗。
    林枫主任的发言
    我完全同意由中共中央拟订、经国务院通过向大会提出的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢各位副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所做的报告。
    几年来，全国文化教育卫生工作，依靠中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，在全国人民的支持和监督下，经过全体文教工作人员的共同努力，在培养建设干部和提高人民文化生活水平方面，都获得了巨大的成就，这些成就，为今后更有计划地更好地进行文教建设，打下了良好基础。
    根据当前文教工作情况，为适应我国经济建设和提高人民文化生活水平的要求，今后各项文教工作应在原有的工作基础上，以提高质量为重点，有计划有重点地稳步发展，同时贯彻在地区分布上的合理部署和公私事业上的统筹安排的方针。
    为了胜利地实现国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的总任务，文教工作的首要的任务，就是大力培养各项建设干部，特别是工业建设的技术干部和管理干部。培养干部的工作，主要应从两方面来进行：一方面是由高等学校和中等专业学校培养；另一方面是由各种业余教育培养。
    过去几年，高等教育和中等专业教育，都有相当大的发展。高等学校一九四九年在校学生一一七、一三三人，一九五四年在校学生二五七、七三一人，增加了百分之一百二十。中等专业学校一九四九年在校学生七七、○九五人，一九五四年在校学生三○○、○二三人，增加了百分之二百八十九。在高等学校和中等专业学校的学生中，工科学生增加得更快；高等工科学生一九五四年比一九四九年增加了百分之二百一十三，中等工科学生比一九五零年增加了百分之四百二十三。在质量方面，也由于积极地学习苏联经验，进行了院系调整、专业设置和教学改革等工作，不仅比旧中国时代有了显著提高，而且逐年都有进步。但是，培养干部的工作，在保证质量方面，还远不能适应国家建设的需要。这是因为我国正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，作为建设中心的新建工业，都是用最先进的技术装备的，这就要求我们培养的建设干部，必须是忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义建设事业、在业务上能够掌握现代科学技术知识，同时也是身体健康的人。没有大批这样的干部，工业化的事业是不可能完成的。过去几年培养出来的高等学校毕业生，大多数是好的，但也有相当一部分人学业水平很低，身体不好，不能胜任他们应该担负的工作。还有一小部分人政治质量很差，有的思想反动、对社会主义建设心怀不满；甚至有的人分配到厂矿，不是去参加建设工作，而是去进行破坏活动。这种情况必须改变。我们学校培养出来的应该是名符其实的社会主义建设干部，不能给反革命分子和坏分子制造
  “资格”。为此，今后必须采取各种措施，着重提高质量，特别是提高政治质量。高等学校首先要严格招生条件，在政治、学业和健康方面一定要够格。对已入学的学生，也应该稳妥地加以整顿。要大力加强政治思想教育，提高师生的社会主义觉悟。当然，提高质量是长期的艰巨的任务，应当在原有的基础上逐步提高，不能操之过急和强求一律。还要注意培养重点学校，给他们以较好的条件，同时对它们提出更多和更高的要求，使我们能有些科学技术水平比较高的学校，以便培养出一批水平比较高的学生，并运用重点学校的经验，指导和推动一般学校的工作。
    根据当前我国技术力量的数量不足和质量很低的情况，今后着重提高质量，必须同时兼顾数量，使提高质量和增加数量正确地结合起来。第一个五年计划中，高等学校的发展规模是很大的。五年内高等学校在校学生将增加百分之一二七点四，其中工科学生将增加百分之一六六点八。第二个五年计划时期内，将有十七万七千多高等工业学校的本科毕业生（其中五年制的毕业生占十五万四千余人），为第一个五年计划期间工科本科毕业生的三倍多。这样的发展速度，在资本主义国家是不可能设想的。我们在第二个五年计划时期中，工科毕业生将超过解放前国民党统治时期二十年间大学工科毕业生总数三万一千多人的四倍多。这就是说，我们培养干部的任务是十分艰巨的。
    培养建设干部工作的另外一个重要方面，就是开展业余教育。我们过去在这方面注意不够，今后必须大力加强业余教育工作，使大量在职干部和职工群众能够系统地提高文化科学水平。必须看到，业余教育是比较有效的培养和提高干部的办法之一，有其广阔的发展前途，将在培养建设干部的事业中发挥重大的作用。
    随着国家建设事业的不断发展，广大的在职干部和职工群众，日益感到现有的文化科学技术水平不能适应工作和生产的要求，他们迫切要求提高。从工矿企业部门的情况看，几年来有大批干部从其他部门转到工矿工作，同时也提拔了大批优秀工人成为管理干部和技术干部。据不完全的统计，仅一九五二年一月至一九五四年九月两年多的时间内，即有十六万三千多名干部从其他部门转到工矿部门，其中县级以上的干部近一万六千多人。几年来从工人中提拔为干部的，数量也很大，据去年不完全的统计，仅技术干部中即有七万三千人是由工人提拔的，占当时技术干部总数的百分之二十六强。今后还一定有大批优秀工人继续成长为干部。这两类干部中，很多都是工矿企业的领导骨干，他们政治上可靠，他们有斗争经验和生产经验，但大多数缺乏系统的文化科学知识，这是阻碍他们掌握现代科学技术和先进企业管理方法的主要困难。如果将这一大批优秀的骨干有计划地加以提高，将对我国社会主义建设事业产生重大的积极影响。
    工矿企业部门的技术干部还有很大一批是从中等专业学校毕业的。在第一个五年计划期间内，工科中等专业学校将有十八万多毕业生到厂矿工作，如果对他们加以培养提高，可能在第二个五年计划时期内生长出相当一批高级技术干部。
    同样，在其他部门中广大的工农干部，也由于文化水平低，不能完全适应工作要求，他们也迫切要求提高。在全国三百八十多万的区级以上的干部中，不及初中文化程度的就有二百多万人。因此，提高这些工农干部的文化科学水平，已成为当前国家建设中一项重大任务。
    提高广大在职干部和工农群众的文化水平，今后必须采取以业余学习为主的方针。在学校、厂矿和机关中，应大量举办从小学到大学的正规的业余学校和函授学校。许多厂矿的经验证明，这样做完全可以收到良好的效果。经业余学校培养出来的技术干部，由于他们有丰富的操作经验，他们的学习又密切结合生产实际，因而质量是好的。如果我们在全国范围内，各级领导普遍重视，制定计划，逐步开展业余教育，是可以培养出大批的干部来的。必须看到，在厂矿、机关和学校中，总有一些人是能够坚持业余学习，并且可以学好的，必须为他们创造适当的条件，让他们学习，以便把他们培养成为干部。
    但是开展业余教育并不是没有困难的。在师资、教材、经费、学习时间和组织领导等方面，目前还存在很多问题。我们将对这些问题切实加以研究和解决，以保证业余教育的顺利开展。
    为了切实完成五年计划，除大量培养建设干部外，还必须逐步提高人民文化生活水平。几年来，政府和全国人民在这方面作了很大努力，普通教育、文化艺术、卫生保健各项事业，都有了巨大的发展，今后还将继续发展。但是文教事业必须随着经济建设的发展，采取稳步发展的方针。如果片面地和孤立地强调文教工作的重要性，实际上就会使文教事业脱离经济建设、首先是脱离工业建设的基础作超比例的发展，这是不恰当的。社会主义建设需要人民学文化，那种以为劳动就不要文化、中小学毕业生就不愿劳动、就一定要升学的想法，都是不切实际的，是错误的。
    我们今后应该采取更多的办法，来发展基层文教事业，在逐渐普及的基础上逐步提高人民文化生活水平。除了国家有计划地发展文化教育事业以外，目前各地群众自动地、积极地出钱出力，自办了许多小学、民校、夜校、俱乐部、业余剧团、联合诊所、托儿站以及幼儿园、保健站等，这是一个很值得重视的办法。随着生产的发展和生活的改善，广大群众已有力量和积极性来自办许多基层文教事业。他们很愿意举办这些事业，因为这些事业确实为他们解决了许多问题。我们如果充分发挥广大群众的力量并加强领导，那末这些事业的发展前途是很大的。这不仅对文教事业的发展开辟了广阔道路，而且可以使国家能以腾出更多的资金投入工业建设。
    但是有些人不赞成或轻视民办文教事业。他们有怕麻烦、怕不正规等思想，对民办文教事业往往采取消极冷淡态度，任其自生自灭，总是企图把一切文教事业都由政府包下来。其结果，政府既包不了，又不要民办。这不仅大大伤害了群众的积极性，而且妨碍了事业的发展。因此，对于群众自办的文教事业，我们应该采取积极提倡并加强领导的方针。只要确实出于群众自愿，群众自己筹款，又有必要的人力，就应该让群众自办，并切实加强领导，使其能有计划有步骤地发展。对于民办事业，不应要求过高，强求一律，或过分强调正规化，而应允许因地制宜，并根据不同条件分别规定适当可行的制度和管理办法，使之同政府文教部门各项有关事业取得联系和配合，避免发生各种偏差。特别要注意防止盲目发展和铺张浪费。
    对群众自办的文教事业和对工矿企业以及私人举办的文教事业，都应该实行统筹安排，纳入国家计划，以便有效地为国家经济建设服务。
    对少数民族地区的文教工作应该特别用力帮助。少数民族中有自己的语言还没有自己的文字的，应帮助他们创造文字。少数民族地区的学校教育和卫生医疗工作应大力发展，他们的文化艺术应该根据他们的特点加以整理、提高和发展。此外对老解放区和文化不发达地区的文教工作也应在人力财力上给予支援，使他们能有较多的发展。文化发达的地区，应以支援这些地区为自己的光荣任务。
    厉行节约、为工业建设提供更多的资金，也是文教部门一项重要的任务。
    目前文教部门在各个方面的浪费现象是很严重的，必须切实加以克服。在基本建设中，必须严格按照国家规定的标准，降低造价和定额。今后无论是新建学校、医院、剧场和影院，都要坚决反对铺张浪费和追求形式的偏向，认真提倡艰苦朴素的作风。在教育方面，要尽量提倡学生走读，并认真推行二部制，提高教学设备的使用率。在卫生和文化方面，要尽量提高病床和影院剧场的利用率，以发挥现有房舍和设备的潜力，尽量减少国家对文教事业的基建投资。对某些经常费的开支标准和人员编制的比例，应该进行一次认真的审查，坚决加以削减。在艺术事业中，应该推行企业化的方针。
    根据上述精神，最近国务院各文教部门，对第一个五年计划后三年的经费，在今春已经核减了四亿余元的基础上，又核减了五亿六千余万元。共为国家节约了近十亿元的文教经费；但事情并没有少办。我们相信，文教部门只要认真贯彻节约精神，也可对国家工业建设提供更多的资金。
    社会主义经济建设和社会主义思想建设是不可分离的。为了使文教工作更好地为国家社会主义建设服务，必须提高全体文教工作人员的政治思想水平，彻底批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，并切实整顿文教队伍。
    文教部门中资产阶级唯心主义思想是普遍地严重地存在着。它的主要表现是非政治倾向。有些人不问政治、不重视马克思列宁主义的学习，不把自己的工作和国家建设以及人民的命运联系起来，不愿为当前政治任务服务，不尊重共产党的领导。例如卫生部某些负责同志歧视和消灭中医的思想，就是资产阶级错误思想的表现。他们违背党中央和毛主席团结中西医的指示，武断地认为中医是“封建医”，说中医是封建社会的产物，应随着封建社会的消灭而消灭。他们不仅在理论上错误地将医学当作社会的上层建筑，特别是他们抹煞了中医中药几千年来在我国保健事业上巨大的实际作用。他们盲目崇拜资本主义文化，鄙视民族文化遗产，对中医抱着严重的粗暴的宗派主义态度。尤其严重的，是党中央和毛主席一再指出这种方针性的错误后，他们在实际工作中仍然没有根本的改变。最近召开的全国文教工作会议对上述错误思想，进行了严肃的批判，这是完全必要的。今后必须认真贯彻中央指示，更好地作好团结中西医的工作。中医有丰富的经验，应该整理和提高；西医有现代科学知识的基础，应该虚心地向中医学习，并帮助他们整理和提高。这样，他们互相学习，共同进步，就能更好地为人民的保健事业服务，为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    还应该着重指出，我们的文教队伍是庞大的，也是复杂的；在这支队伍中绝大部分是好人，兢兢业业，努力工作，有很多成绩；但事实证明也还隐藏了像胡风反革命集团及其他反革命分子。这些反革命分子用两面手法，把自己伪装成马克思主义者，伪装成革命的文教工作者，用各种阴险狠毒的方法破坏革命事业。胡风及其反革命集团在文教队伍中隐藏了二十多年之久，他们的党羽，窃据了文教部门许多岗位，用反革命的思想毒害了不少纯洁的青年，进行反革命的活动。他们的真实面目直到最近才被揭发出来，这就说明了我们文教队伍中政治麻痹和组织不纯的严重情况。全体文教工作者，必须警醒起来，坚决地同一切暗藏的反革命分子作不懈的斗争，彻底地把他们揭露出来，清除出去。
    为了克服资产阶级唯心主义思想和清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，必须在一切文教部门中，大力加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习和宣传，必须使文教工作者学会掌握辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的思想武器，使他们能够辨别和批判资产阶级唯心主义的错误思想。特别重要的，一切文教工作人员必须认识只有依靠共产党的领导，才能做好工作。由战无不胜的马克思列宁主义所武装起来的中国共产党，不仅能够胜利地领导军事斗争和政治斗争，而且能够胜利地领导国家的经济建设，也完全能够领导和必须领导文教工作。无数事实证明，任何革命工作离开了马克思列宁主义和党的领导，就无法前进。任何认为党不能领导文教工作的想法，都是极端错误的，必须加以纠正。
    毛主席说过：
      “我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。
    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
    指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。
    我们有充分的信心，克服一切艰难困苦，将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。”
  陈叔通副委员长的
    发言
    我完全同意发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理的报告，完全同意一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算和李先念副总理的报告。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是根据宪法实现国家在过渡时期总任务的开始，是中国人民从落后的农业经济走向社会主义工业化的开始，这是一个伟大的开始！去年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕的时候，毛主席曾经说过：我们正在前进。今天，我们有了这样一个伟大的建设的开始，就是我们前进的一个里程碑。就是将要走向世界上先进的社会主义工业化的前线上。毫无疑义，这个伟大的开始必将导致中国人民永远摆脱贫困和剥削的境地，走上繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    大家知道，社会主义工业化的前途是中国人民在中国共产党领导下长期流血斗争得来的。如果不是取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的胜利，不是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度的日益巩固和发展，不是强大的社会主义阵营特别是苏联的国际主义的真诚无私的援助，我们不可能有这样一个伟大的五年计划。我们全国人民应该永远感谢中国共产党，永远感谢毛主席，永远感谢苏联及人民民主国家。
    第一个五年计划经过热烈的讨论以后，我们更能够看清楚各方面的情况，更能够统一认识，集中力量，向同一个方向前进。根据我个人的体会，我认为在建设过程中必须先明了以下各点。
    第一，必须明了社会主义工业化是以优先发展重工业为中心。只有这样才可以使我国工业、农业、交通运输业得到技术的改造，才可以使我国国防力量更加强大和巩固，才可以不断地增加农业和工业的生产，保证人民生活水平的不断提高。第一个五年计划就是实现优先发展重工业的方针，是完全正确的。
    第二，必须明了我们国家的五年计划是实事求是的，切实可行的，这个计划是按照我国当前的实际情况与具体条件，是根据我国资金和技术力量的可能，贯彻重点建设的方针来进行建设的。轻重工业之间，大中小型企业之间，工业、农业、交通运输与文化建设之间，国营、合作社、公私合营与私营企业之间，以及生产与消费，国内贸易与国际贸易之间，都不是彼此孤立的，而是有适当的配合和联系，有一定的部署和安排，形成一个有机的、密切结合起来的整体。所以，任何割裂的看法和局部的观点，都是不适宜的。
    第三，必须明了我们国家的建设计划固然是以发展重工业为中心，但不是不兼顾到人民物质生活和文化生活的需要的。就五年基本建设投资的分配比例来看，工业部门虽然占了百分之五十八点二，但其他部门也占了百分之四十一点八。就重工业和轻工业投资的比例来看，虽然轻工业的投资比例比较小，但国营和私营的轻工业还有相当大的一部分没有使用的潜在力量，并且还有广大的手工业可以做重要的补充。对于农业方面的投资，表面看来也不算大，但是重工业方面有一些投资如拖拉机、化学肥料、水力发电等建设，都是为着农业的发展打基础的。所以，五年内生产资料生产的增长，是与轻工业、农业、交通运输、邮电，以及文化教育和科学研究事业的发展相适应的，是与人民物质生活和文化生活水平的提高相适应的。
    第四，必须明了我国第一个五年计划，是在执行两个年度计划过程中取得了不少的经验，并完成了一些任务以后，才编制完毕的。所以，这个五年计划是更加接近实际，更加能够保证它的胜利完成。它是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个重大的步骤，它的胜利完成，将为我国社会主义工业化建立初步的基础，将为农业和手工业的社会主义改造建立初步的基础，将为私营工商业的社会主义改造建立基础。所以，第一个五年计划的基本任务和第二个五年计划的基本任务是连贯着的，不可分割的。有一些基本建设可以在第一个五年计划中作比较大规模的投资，另外有一些，则必须在第一个五年计划中作好准备以后，才能够在第二个五年计划中作大量的投资。先后缓急之间，是必须作审慎的安排的。
    第五，必须明了，在计划执行的过程中，我们是会遇到一些困难的。由于我们经验不够，技术力量不足和资源情况还很多不明，而且由于我们还有多种经济成分同时并存，特别是由于社会主义建设事业是关联着六万万人民生活习惯根本改革的大事情，我们不可能设想，这样伟大的事业是可以不经过努力就完成的。但是我们已有几年建设的经验，有全体劳动人民的支持，有苏联和人民民主国家的援助，特别是我们有中国共产党和工人阶级的领导，所以，我们一定能够克服一切困难，胜利地实现我们的五年计划。
    大家知道，在我们的工作中，尽可能不要犯错误，但是不可能不犯错误，而且过去也已经在某些方面犯了一定的错误。比如几年来在我们的建设中，有严重的铺张浪费现象，就是一个例子。今后我们应该少犯错误，已经犯过的错误不要再重复；发现工作中有错误的时候，就必须及时纠正，尤其要注意经常检查，防止错误的发生。只有这样，我们才能很好地完成我们的计划。
    五年计划同全国各阶级各阶层的人民都有密切的关系。这个计划和一九五五年国家的预算，经全国人民代表大会通过以后，就成为全国人民必须遵守的建设纲领和法律。全国人民必须在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，以具体行动来保证这个计划的胜利完成。也只有全国人民都能够遵守国家的纲领和法律，一切按照纲领和法律的规定办事，才能够完满地实现我们的五年计划。
    五年计划资金来源主要是靠人民内部积累。厉行节约，是实现国家工业化在积累资金方面所应该采取的唯一的办法。节约运动必须是全民的运动。全国人民必须继续发扬克勤克俭艰苦奋斗的作风，克服任何微小的浪费，减少任何不必要的消耗，以便节约一切可能节约的物资和资金，用来供应国家建设事业的需要，保证五年计划的实现。
    要动员全国人民参加社会主义建设，就必须使他们懂得国家的政策是为了全国人民美好的将来，因而就必须广泛地做好五年计划的宣传教育工作。五年计划的具体内容是最好的爱国教材。只要我们真正做好宣传教育工作，使全国人民真正了解我们国家的伟大的建设计划，那末，全国人民必将进一步地热爱祖国，热爱自己的生活，必将更能够发挥积极性与创造性，欢欣鼓舞地参加国家的建设事业。
    实现五年计划，是一个激烈的、复杂的、尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，国内外敌人必将勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们的社会主义建设。我们必须千百倍地提高警惕，严密防止敌人的阴谋破坏活动。我们必须从潘汉年、胡风反革命事件中吸取教训，并真正学到一点识别敌人的方法，把各种暗藏的反革命分子一步一步地清查出来，彻底消灭敌人的破坏和反抗。
    在全国各阶级各阶层中，我今天特别要提到工商界的责任。私营工商业在第一个五年计划中还占着相当大的比重，还有它的重要作用，对国家、对人民可以作出一定的贡献，这是一方面。同时五年计划就是法律，工商界更应该严格注意遵守。因为在敌人的阴谋的进攻中，工商界是一个最脆弱的环节。有些人对于社会主义改造还在动摇，有些人依然消极经营，有些人眼睛不亮，警惕性不高；还有少数人仍在重犯“五毒”，有的甚至有抵抗领导、破坏社会主义改造的不法行为。这是不能容许的。今后私营工商业者必须进一步提高警惕，划清敌我界限，遵守法律，服从计划，改善经营，厉行节约，以积极接受领导、积极接受社会主义改造的实际行动来还击敌人的破坏阴谋，来保证第一个五年计划的胜利完成。工商界中的先进代表人物，在中国共产党和人民政府的教育下，应该更好地担负起自己的责任，在广大工商界中进行宣传教育工作，起带头、骨干和桥梁作用，协助政府推动全国私营工商业者，积极接受社会主义改造，加强个人的思想改造，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，和全国人民一起，向着社会主义建设的前途努力迈进。
    金仲华代表的发言
      我热烈拥护李富春副总理所作“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，也完全同意李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢等几位副总理和彭真副委员长的几个报告。
      五年计划的宏大规模和光明远景，使我们感到极大的鼓舞。中国人民许多年来所追求的建设社会主义的理想，已经开始成为事实了。这个伟大的计划是在中国共产党中央和毛泽东主席的直接领导下编制的，它是完全符合于我们全国人民的整体利益、长远利益和最高利益的。
    为实现五年计划而斗争，是我们全国人民的一个光荣而艰巨的任务。我们必须抓住中心环节，做好思想工作。我们国家在过渡时期的中心任务是发展社会主义工业化，社会主义工业化的中心环节是优先发展重工业。必须围绕着这个中心来有计划地进行建设。我们要集中主要资金来发展重工业，而且必须按照社会主义的方法从内部积累建设资金。离开了这个基本路线，我们的社会主义建设就会落空。因此，实现五年计划不能不是一系列艰苦的斗争，每个人必须从思想到行动上不断考验自己。我们要不要增产节约，反对浪费，为工业化积累资金呢？要不要统购统销，计划供应，贯彻国家的粮食政策呢？要不要精简机构，紧缩编制，提高工作的效率呢？要不要按照合理布局，服从统一分配，来有计划地进行建设呢？也就是说，我们要不要为了伟大的社会主义事业的胜利，把自由散漫、个人打算、局部观点、本位主义这些旧习惯和坏作风坚决去掉，而积极发扬“艰苦奋斗、服从计划”的新精神呢？为了建设社会主义，我们就必须在行动上加以贯彻。
    我们的伟大事业的前进，不会是风平浪静的。前面必然会有困难，有斗争；有社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争，有复杂和尖锐的阶级斗争。我们必须用社会主义的思想来武装自己。我们要在不断战胜困难中前进。同时，我们必须提高警惕，防止国内外敌人对我们事业的破坏。
    我们的事业愈前进，敌人对我们的仇恨就愈厉害，他们对我们的破坏也就愈加恶毒。正如李富春副总理所指出的，“人民的胜利就是人民的敌人的失败，……人民的敌人是决不愿意自己失败的，他们必然千方百计地来破坏我们的五年计划。”最近胡风反革命集团的被揭发，对我们是一个非常重要的教训。几年来，胡风集团的反革命分子混在人民的队伍里，采取阴险狡猾的两面派手法，“争取人”，
  “联络人”，钻进我们的“心脏”，单在上海一个地方，就钻进了我们三十多个单位部门，对我们的人民革命和建设事业造成了严重的损害。
    胡风反革命集团的特点也就是其他各种暗藏的反革命分子的特点。这次大会前，我们在上海视察社会治安和司法工作中，看到几个被破获的反革命分子的案件。一个血债累累的国民党反动官员利用旧关系混进了工商联，又混进民主党派。一个美蒋职业特务从台湾潜回上海，进行长期埋伏，他伪装积极，混进里弄组织，做了读报组组长，又做广播电台通讯员，进一步多方探取情报。我们的群众工作，竟被敌人拿来做掩护了。上海在过去的镇反运动中虽然取得了成就，但是由于饶漱石的反党阴谋，庇护反革命分子，和潘汉年的长期反革命阴谋活动，使镇压反革命的斗争很不彻底，群众很不满意。反革命分子的活动现在愈来愈采取隐蔽的方式，而且特别针对着我们的经济建设和国防建设，这是值得我们非常警惕的。
    我们的麻痹大意是很严重的。拿胡风事件来说，有些人直到第三批材料揭露以后，才感到“大吃一惊”。但是，仅仅“吃惊”了一下是不够的。特别是我们知识分子，常常说自己太“书生气”了，存留着不少“自由主义”；这一方面是在批判自己，但同时还是在原谅自己。所以，我们必须从胡风和潘汉年的反革命事件中认真吸取教训，百倍提高警惕，坚决克服脱离政治的倾向，严格地批判自由主义和麻痹思想，从复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己。
      我们的五年计划建设是具有历史创造性的伟大事业。我们事业的成功，不仅关系着我们全国人民和子孙后代的幸福，而且也会大大增强全世界和平民主阵营的力量。我们的任务是光荣的，责任也是重大的。因此，我们必须记牢目前还存在着帝国主义的包围，蒋介石卖国集团还在台湾作垂死的挣扎，国内外敌人无时无刻不在阴谋策划对我们的破坏。我们文教工作者必须纯洁自己的队伍，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，以最大热情来参加祖国的建设，以无限忠诚来保卫我们的事业。我们一定要争取胜利地完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的建设，向着光明、幸福的社会主义目标前进！
    张会亭代表的发言
    我是个老农民，不识字，说不好话，上台来心里就发慌，请大家原谅。参加这次大会，经过听报告和分组讨论，对五年计划和各项报告，我都同意，别说五年计划就是十年计划，我也是完全拥护的。五年计划就是社会主义的方向，是社会主义的道路。有了方向，有了道路，俺们农民就有了奔头，劲头就更大啦！不讲别的，就讲讲农民的事情，讲讲我自己的事情：
    我在旧社会里，打了一辈子长工。不说大家都能知道，像我这样的人，在旧社会里是不被当人看待的。从那个社会里混过来可真是不容易。想想解放前，我是家破人散；只有解放后，才全家团圆，也就是说才有了个家，土改中又分了土地，接着参加了互助组，参加了合作社，多打了粮食，吃的穿的也不愁了。过去做梦也没想到的好日子，如今过上了。这些好处不是天上掉下来的，农民们知道，这些好处都是毛主席和中国共产党领导俺们斗争得来的。如今和过去是简直不能比较。不往远处说，就说去年俺家闹那样大水、大雪灾，真是平地水有
  一丈深，雪有三尺厚，要是国民党时候，只有两条路：不是淹死、饿死，就是全家逃荒。如今呢？遇到了几百年没听说过的大水灾，不光没死人，也没有逃荒的；就连耕牛，政府也是积极想办法，在那寒冬腊月，三尺多厚的大雪天，领导俺们往几百里以外的地方转移，不然的话，今年使啥家伙搞生产呢？政府的关怀，就是说三天三夜，也说不完的。俺们只有努力增产，多收粮食，减轻国家救济负担，来支援工业化。
    再说说增加生产，头一条就是要走合作化的道路。俺乡是合作化乡，一百家农户除了四户地主富农，九十六户都入了合作社。社员们说：“入了合作社，要多打粮食，就有办法。”第二条就是听了毛主席的话，治理了淮河，使俺们过去多灾多难的淮河两岸人民，安下了家，并减轻了“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、不雨旱灾”的苦难。第三条就是实行了俺省里提出的农业增产的“三改”办法。有了这三条，就保证能够多打粮食，增加收入。就拿俺们合作社的产量来做个比较，全社社员每人平均三亩地，在没有组织起来前，每亩平均只收百来斤；组织起来后，一九五二年每人平均收成五百多斤，一九五三年每人收到九百多斤，就是去年闹那样大水灾，每人还收七百多斤。去年冬季更因响应了“三改”号召，扩大了夏季收成，每人到手的小麦收入就有四百多斤，看样子秋后丰收也是有保证的，就是今年秋季不收，也不再要政府救济了。俺打算今年全年俺们每人收粮一千二百多斤，争取明年每人收入一千五百多斤，来支援国家工业化。将来工业发展了，有了拖拉机，我们就更有了信心，更有了保证。归总一句话，这是共产党和毛主席领导的正确、伟大，毛主席给俺们农民的幸福。
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    程潜代表的发言
    我完全同意“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划（草案）”、李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，建议大会予以通过，并作出相应的决议。
    一九三三年，斯大林总结苏联第一个五年计划，谈到必须发展重工业的时候，曾以关注和同情的语言说过这样的话：“中国因为没有自己的重工业，没有自己的军事工业，而被一切逞性妄为的人所蹂躏着。”在斯大林说这段话的那个时候，在中国人民大革命取得胜利以前的很长一段时期，中国人民是处在深重苦难当中的。在那些岁月里，许多旧民主主义革命的先行者，许多有着朴素的为国为民思想的社会活动家，许多有良心的科学技术工作者，许多天真的改良主义者，目睹国弱民穷的局面，都曾奋发立志，想做一番事业。孙中山先生在其有名的
  “建国方略”中，提出了巨大的“实业计划”，想在中国进行经济建设；有不少人提出了“实业救国”的口号，有些人曾经要求“振兴国货，抵制外货”，有些人甚至还在风雨飘摇中支撑着办了少数可怜的小工厂。但是，历史表明：孙中山的“实业计划”毕竟没有、也不可能实现，而一切天真的改良主义者的幻想，也在残酷的现实面前碰得头破血流。这是什么原因呢？毛主席一针见血地作了回答：“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”现在，我们有了这样一个新中国，我们具备了发展工业的前提条件，因此我们能够循着社会主义的轨道，着手进行发展国民经济的建设事业。人们重温历史的惨痛教训，瞻望光辉灿烂的社会主义远景，不能不由衷地感激领导中国人民取得革命胜利、并领导中国人民继续朝着社会主义目标前进的中国共产党和毛泽东主席。
    第一个五年计划是中国共产党根据列宁关于过渡时期的学说、苏联建成社会主义社会的经验和中国的具体情况所制定出来的，这是实现国家在过渡时期的总任务的一个重大步骤，是福国利民、为我们子孙后代谋幸福的宏伟纲领。第一个五年计划所规定的任务，表明了我国发展国民经济的社会主义方向。在五年内，全国经济建设和文化教育建设的支出总数为七百六十六亿四千万元，这表明了我国发展国民经济的巨大规模。在五年内，我国工业总产值将增长百分之九十八点三，农业及其副业的总产值将增长百分之二十三点三，这表明了我国工农业发展的较快的速度。在五年内，工农业等各个经济部门生产发展的指标，都注意了保持适当的比例，并经过计算核对和反复平衡，这表明了我国第一个五年计划遵循着国民经济按比例发展的基本法则，它的基础是稳妥可靠的，因而胜利完成和争取超额完成第一个五年计划，也是完全有把握的。
    第一个五年计划的编制，已注意到使中央各部的计划同地方的计划结合起来，在中央统一领导下，集中主要力量发展重工业，首先保证重点工程的建设，同时充分发挥地方的积极性和创造性。对编制和执行地方计划的方针以及应该注意的问题，五年计划都作了明确的规定。把五年计划的精神正确地、具体地贯彻到地方计划中去，使地方计划执行的成果有力地支持和配合统一的国家计划的完满实现，应该是地方各级国家机关的神圣职责。
    就湖南而言，农业生产在全省国民经济中占有极大的比重。在第一个五年计划期间内，必须在国家总的方针政策指导下，大力开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，把领导农业生产和农业生产合作当做自己最主要的和经常的任务。到今春为止，湖南已建立农业生产合作社一万三千多个，计划在今年将农业生产合作社发展到四万五千个。前两年湖南遭受了严重的自然灾害，农业增产计划没有完成，因此第一个五年计划后三年的农业生产任务将十分繁重。为了达成第一个五年计划国家对湖南农业生产的要求，必须首先与自然灾害、特别是水旱灾害作斗争。山区和丘陵区要兴修中、小型水利工程，做好水土保持工作。洞庭湖区要着重培修垸堤，防洪排渍。洞庭湖区稻谷产量占全省稻谷总产量的百分之二十弱，是湖南省商品粮食来源的重要地区。去年湖区遭受了当前人力物力不可抗拒的水灾，稻谷严重减产。为了帮助灾区群众重建家园，恢复和发展农业生产，去冬今春，我们组织了八十五万民工、干部，在冰封雪掩的严寒下，完成了规模巨大的堤垸修复工程，使湖区六百万亩良田在一九四九年的洪水位下可保安全生产。重点整修的堤垸即使遭遇一九五四年的洪水，也可以保障二百万亩垸田不溃少溃。但要根除洞庭湖水患，仍须按照国家计划，结合长江流域规划和全面治理，有步骤地进行。其次，为了增加粮食产量，必须多种高产作物，今年全省计划种红薯六百万亩，总产量可望达到七十亿斤。再次，必须有领导地、因地制宜地进行农业生产的技术改良，发展山区林区经济。湖南全省各种经济成分的地方工业，计有大小厂矿五千个单位；个体手工业者散布全省，生产潜力很大。这些地方工业和手工业今后还要积极发展，适应国家计划的要求，贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，正确地发挥作用。手工业的合作化还必须有步骤地推进。湖南私营工业有三千多户，职工近五万人，其中加工订货、收购包销的私营工业已占私营工业总产值的百分之八十一点七。全省已经公私合营的企业为一百零五户，职工一万人左右。全省九个省辖市的私营商业将近四万户，已纳入国家资本主义形式的有八千多户。
    以上就是湖南工作情况的极其简单的轮廓。当然，我们的工作还是有许多缺点的。例如：在互助合作运动中，贯彻自愿互利原则和阶级政策还不够；在粮食统购统销方面，也还有个别地区在评定产量时偏高偏低，而城乡的粮食统销都有浪费的情况；在巩固社会治安方面，从领导思想上来检查还有些麻痹观念，还未有力地运用人民民主专政的武器，给反革命分子和刑事罪犯以应有的打击。为了完成第一个五年计划的任务，我们必须坚决克服缺点，充分发挥群众和干部的积极性，把今后的工作做得更好一些。增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费，是一项普遍的、长期的、经常持久的政治任务，我们将进一步地从实践上认真贯彻执行。
    我国第一个五年计划的编制和执行是有深刻的国际意义的。我们在国际上的朋友为我们的成就而欢呼。但我们在国外的敌人却感到恐慌危惧，它们对我们的敌意和仇视必然加深，对我们进行的破坏和捣乱必然加剧。在国内已被消灭的反动阶级的残余和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，也必将进行各种更加隐蔽、更加毒辣的暗害和破坏活动，潘汉年及胡风集团反革命罪行的被揭露，就是明显的例证。因此，我们必须加强国防力量，以保卫祖国安全和经济建设；必须坚决把一切暗藏的反革命分子，从我们的各个战线上清洗出去。只要我们一时一刻也不放松对国内外敌人的斗争，我们就将是永远胜利的。
    各位代表！让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结全国人民，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，努力工作，克服困难，为胜利完成和争取超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    沈雁冰部长的发言
    我完全同意由中国共产党中央委员会提出、经国务院通过的“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案”，我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢各位副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，将使我国工农业生产总值和社会主义经济成份有很大的增长，这标志着我国正在向社会主义工业化的伟大目标推进，标志着我国人民民主专政的进一步巩固，我国人民物质与文化生活的进一步提高。我们全体文化艺术工作者热烈拥护这个计划草案，并决心为它的实现而努力奋斗。
    但同时，我们决不能忽略我们所处的环境，决不能忽略在我们的周围还有着内外阶级敌人，还有着和平的敌人。这些仇视中国人民、仇视我国社会主义建设、仇视和平与民主的敌人，对我国社会主义建设事业的每一步前进，都不会甘心的，他们必然会千方百计加以阻挠和破坏。因此，决不能设想我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，会不经过严重的斗争而一帆风顺、太太平平地实现；恰恰相反，第一个五年计划实现的过程，必将是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。而且随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，阶级斗争必将更加深化，更加复杂和尖锐；敌人的破坏活动也将愈来愈加阴险狠毒。他们不仅会加紧公开的破坏活动，而且将更多地使用伪装的、隐蔽的和两面派的手法，打进人民内部，从政治、经济、军事和思想各条战线上，来破坏我们的建设，腐蚀人民群众的斗争意志，影响人民群众对于社会主义事业的必胜的信念。最近揭发出来的胡风反革命集团，就是这一类反革命敌人的最突出的例证。
    从已经揭发的材料看来，这个胡风反革命集团，早在全国解放以前，就一贯反对和抵制中国共产党和中国共产党所领导的人民革命事业，散布各种反动的言论，恶毒地攻击马克思列宁主义，诋毁和咒骂中国共产党的文艺方针和文化政策，诋毁和咒骂一切进步作家，企图削弱马克思列宁主义的影响，阻挠进步知识分子和青年学生接近革命斗争的实际；而在全国解放后，则疯狂地仇恨人民革命的胜利，仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切，采取各种阴谋手段，“争取人”，“联络人”，扩大他们的反革命组织，派遣他们集团的分子以各种伪装，钻进中国共产党、人民解放军、国家机关、人民团体、企业、学校的内部，建立反革命的活动据点，系统地散布他们的反革命理论，扩大他们的反革命的思想影响，妄图推翻中华人民共和国，恢复帝国主义和国民党在中国的反动统治。这个反革命集团，在
  一九五四年十月利用学术文化界所发动的对资产阶级思想的批判运动，公开提出他们的反革命纲领，向整个革命思想战线发动了猖狂的进攻。也正是在这个进攻中，这个二十多年来伪装拥护革命实际上是反对革命、伪装拥护人民实际上是反对人民、伪装拥护中国共产党实际上是反对中国共产党的胡风反革命集团的真面目，在人民的面前被揭露了。
    胡风反革命集团向革命、向中国共产党和人民进攻的集中表现，就是那个臭名昭著的“对文艺问题的意见”。在这个意见书里，胡风把党向作家提出的学习马克思主义、深入工农兵生活、改造自己的非工人阶级思想、批判地继承和发扬民族传统、积极为政治服务，诬蔑为插在作家和读者头上的“五把刀子”，并且恶毒地诬蔑中国共产党对文艺界的领导是“宗派主义”的“军阀统治”。他们正面地进一步提出了自己的六条反革命的纲领，这就是：反对作家掌握共产主义世界观，反对作家和工农兵结合，反对作家进行思想改造，反对在文艺中运用民族形式，反对文艺服务于当前的政治斗争，最后建议解散文艺界的统一组织，这实际上就是要取消中国共产党的领导。这六条反革命纲领的锋芒，不是仅仅指向文艺问题，而是针对着我国社会主义事业的全部。因为学习马克思列宁主义、改造自己的非工人阶级思想、和工农兵相结合、尊重自己民族的传统、积极地为当前的政治斗争服务、遵从中国共产党的统一领导，不仅对于作家是完全必要的，对于我国所有的知识分子、机关干部和人民群众都是完全必要的。没有这六条，或不按这六条办事，这将意味着什么呢？这将意味着我们所有的作家、知识分子，所有的干部，都将变成脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离自己民族的传统、脱离党和政府的领导的一群艺术至上主义者，一群官僚主义者，一群鼠目寸光的庸人，一群四分五裂的自由主义者等等。由此可见，胡风反革命集团这个反革命纲领的用意是十分险恶的，其目的是企图解除我们的思想武装，取消毛泽东主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中所宣布的、保证我国过渡到社会主义社会的两个最高准则：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党，”“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”因此，问题很明白，所谓“对文艺问题的意见”，不过是这些反革命分子假借文艺问题作幌子，企图从这里打开缺口，来实现他们一整套的反社会主义的反革命纲领。这个“对文艺问题的意见”中所鼓吹的反革命理论，无疑地对于社会主义革命事业有着极大的危害性。其危害性特别在于这个反革命纲领中的许多基本论点，早在胡风反革命集团被揭发以前，就长期地系统地被这个集团的分子大肆宣扬；“对文艺问题的意见”不过是这些反动论点的一个集中表现而已。因此，在大张旗鼓揭发和肃清胡风反革命集团的同时，必须坚决地系统地和深入地对这些反动思想加以批判和驳斥。
    作为一个文化工作者，我深深感到这次胡风反革命集团的事件，对于我们文化艺术界有着特别严重的和深刻的教育意义。胡风反革命集团的反动言论、行动，在我们文化艺术界过去不是没有注意过，不是没有和他们斗争过，但是我们都只把这简单看成是文艺思想问题，看成是个人的思想品质问题，最多看成是一个文艺界的个人野心家的小集团的问题，而没有尖锐地把它作为一个政治问题来严肃地认真地加以追究。这说明我们的政治嗅觉是多么地不灵敏，我们的思想曾经麻痹到了怎样的程度。这种政治上的麻痹大意，自然就给胡风分子和其他一切暗藏反革命分子大开方便之门。同时从胡风反革命集团这个事件上，也说明我们的文化战线在思想上确乎还存在着严重的弱点。例如在文化艺术部门中，非政治倾向、脱离群众、脱离实际、轻视民族文化艺术传统等资产阶级思想，就是普遍地和严重地存在着的。它们表现在：不少文化艺术工作者不积极或不愿意为当前的政治任务服务，不反映当前的复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争，在阶级敌人面前丧失警惕性，不关心国内外大事，不关怀群众的生活；片面地强调文艺特殊，不问政治，不尊重中国共产党的领导，不学习或不钻研马克思列宁主义的理论和党和国家的政策；轻视普及和通俗工作，不愿创作为广大群众所迫切需要和为群众喜闻乐见的通俗的文艺作品，不愿为工农兵演出和到群众中去学习锻炼，不积极或不屑于去辅导工农兵群众的文艺活动，不重视培养工农兵成份的文艺人才，不重视文化馆、图书馆等群众文化工作，不重视通俗读物的出版和发行；轻视民族民间的文化艺术遗产，盲目崇拜西洋资产阶级文艺，不重视学习苏联先进经验，等等。所有这些资产阶级思想都极大地妨碍了文艺为社会主义建设服务、为工农兵服务的方针的贯彻，同时也常常为胡风反革命集团和其他暗藏的反革命分子所利用。
    文化工作是思想战线上的一个重要的组成部分。当前文化工作的任务，就是要用社会主义思想去教育和鼓舞人民群众为建成社会主义社会而奋斗。我们要完成这个任务，首先要大力发展具有正确思想内容和一定艺术水平的文学艺术创作，特别是要大力发展为人民群众所需要、而又适合群众的水平、为群众所喜闻乐见的文学艺术作品；并通过各种工具把文学艺术创作的成果广泛地普及到人民群众中去，来不断地巩固和扩大社会主义思想的阵地，抵制和削弱资产阶级思想对人民群众的侵蚀。为了很好地完成这个任务，我们必须有一支在思想上政治上和组织上纯洁而健全的文化队伍。因此，当前文化艺术工作的首要任务，就是要从思想上、政治上和组织上努力整顿、加强和建设我们的队伍。
    一切进步的革命的文化艺术工作者，都应当深刻地从胡风反革命集团事件吸取应有的教训，以最大的革命热情，积极参加当前肃清胡风反革命集团和其他一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争，要在这个斗争中，大大地提高我们的政治水平和政治警惕性，并且更加团结起来，清除一切暗藏在文化队伍内的反革命分子，以纯洁我们的队伍。同时，应当继续深入细致地批判胡风反革命集团的反动思想，批判一切以唯心主义世界观为核心的各种形式的资产阶级错误思想，来不断提高我们的思想水平，提高文化工作的战斗性和思想性，以便更好地为国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业服务。
    代表同志们！肃清胡风反革命集团及其他一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争，是我国在过渡时期一场革命和反革命的极其严重极其紧张的斗争，是遍及于我国社会主义建设的各条战线上的斗争。每一个革命工作者和每一个革命人民都不能置身于这个斗争之外。我们应当百倍地提高我们的政治警惕，把一切暗藏的反对社会主义革命、反对人民民主专政、反对社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的反革命分子，从我们的队伍里彻底地干净地清除出去，来保证我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划的胜利实现。我们坚决相信，我们一定能够胜利地完成这一任务。
    代表同志们！我们的国家，这几年来，不仅在国内建设方面已取得了一批批的胜利，而且在保卫亚洲和世界和平的神圣事业中，也同样作了重大的贡献。最近在赫尔辛基召开的世界和平大会，有力地表明了世界和平力量的空前的壮大和团结。这个会议有力地表明了：尽管各国人民的见解和信仰有着不同，但在保卫和平、防止战争、争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势的愿望上，是完全一致的。这种一致性的表现，就是这次大会所一致通过的各项文件和宣言。中国人民热烈欢迎和支持世界和平大会所通过的文件和宣言，并愿意为实现其所列举的目标而真诚地努力。这种努力的最好的和最实际的表现，就是我们要兢兢业业，克服困难，增加生产，厉行节约，来胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，以我们的伟大的和平劳动来加强保卫世界和平的斗争。革命一定战胜反革命！和平一定战胜战争！
    李涛代表的发言
    我完全同意国务院向大会提出的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢各位副总理的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    以建立国家社会主义工业化的初步基础、建立对农业手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础和建立对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的基础为目标的中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是实现国家过渡时期总任务的宏伟纲领和重大步骤。这一伟大计划的胜利实现，将大大改变我国的经济面貌。我国原有工业基础十分薄弱，大家知道，没有重工业的发展，就不可能有国民经济的全面发展，就没有巩固的国防，就不可能使人民生活得到改善。因此，以发展重工业为中心的第一个五年计划，正是反映全国人民的意志，代表着全国人民目前利益和长远利益的。我建议大会予以通过作为全国人民奋斗的总目标。
    根据国家发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的规定，在第一个五年计划期间，要建立以鞍山钢铁工业为中心的东北工业基地。国家在辽宁省的基本建设投资很大，新建扩建重点工程很多，现有工业生产任务很重。辽宁省人民在第一个五年计划时期的首要任务，就是要保证这些重点工程质量好，造价低并按时竣工，按时投入生产。同时，要充分发挥现有工业的作用，积极生产，努力增加新品种，提高质量，降低成本，为工农业生产和人民生活的需要，提供更多更好的工业品；更要为新建的厂矿制造新装备，培养技术人员和工人，为国家积累建设资金。因此，辽宁省在实现国家第一个五年计划中担负着艰巨而光荣的任务，我们深深感到责任的重大。但由于我们领导水平不高，领导能力与新的任务不相适应，工作上的缺点和错误是很多很严重的。如在工矿企业中政治思想工作还很薄弱，资本主义经营思想还相当严重；不少单位完成国家计划不全面不均衡；尤其严重的是在基本建设、工业生产等各部门存在着严重的浪费现象。这些严重的浪费现象，已给国家的社会主义建设事业造成了不少的损失。
    为了保证完成国家第一个五年计划，就必须响应中共中央和国务院的号召，组织和动员全省工人阶级和全体劳动人民，在经济建设及各个战线上，开展全面增产节约运动。而在全面增产节约运动中，必须把全面贯彻国家的方针政策，全面改进领导，特别要加强政治思想领导，全面改进企业管理，全面完成国家计划作为总的要求。
    根据中共中央和国务院的指示，中国共产党辽宁省的各级组织和各级人民委员会积极地组织和领导了增产节约运动的开展。在五、六月间所召开的各级党代表会议上，都根据国家的总要求，结合辽宁省当前的具体情况，研究和提出了保证完成国家五年计划，开展增产节约运动的具体要求和行动措施，并作了部署。各企业的行政、工会、青年团组织，深入地进行了发动广大职工讨论制定增产节约计划和组织贯彻增产节约计划的工作。到目前止，增产节约运动已在全省范围内初步地开展起来，并收到了初步效果。如在基本建设方面，通过坚决削减非生产性建筑投资，降低建筑标准，和在保证生产需要条件下，降低生产性建筑造价，仅据沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、阜新等六个市的初步统计，即可节省投资一万零六百三十四万元。在城市建设方面，在充分运用原有设备的条件下，本着分别轻重缓急，逐步举办各项公用事业的精神，仅沈阳、旅大等七个市即可为国家节省公用事业投资四百三十一万元。在国营和地方国营工业生产方面，通过增加生产，节约原材料，使用代用原料，提高实收率，减少废品损耗和产品积压，改善经营管理，仅据沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、营口等地五十个国营和地方国营厂矿的不完全统计即可增产节约六千一百余万元。在农业生产方面，通过开发水田，多种高产作物，加强和改进技术等措施，今年可增产粮食三十万吨。在国营、合作社营商业方面，通过认真加强计划性、建立和健全物资责任制度，改进商品验收、运输和保管工作，降低商品流转费用和商品损耗率，可为国家节约一千九百万元。在粮食工作上，通过在城市中认真进行定量供应，在机关、企业、学校和部队中认真实行粮食预决算制度，在农村中彻底进行评销工作，以及认真加强和改进对粮食的加工、保管和运输工作，提高出米率、减少损失浪费，可在削减六亿斤指标的基础上保证合理供应。对各机关、团体、企业、学校，也按中央指示精神开始进行整编机构、减少层次、紧缩编制、精简人员、整顿生活管理制度的工作，从而初步地改进了工作作风，提高了工作效率，减少了浪费现象。此外，交通运输、政法、文教、卫生等部门的增产节约运动，也都有了一些成绩。所有这些都证明了五年计划中所提出的厉行节约、反对浪费，是完全正确的，增产节约的潜力是很大的。如把这项工作经常化起来，可更多地为国家积累资金，保证完成和超额完成五年计划。但由于这个运动尚处在开始阶段，运动开展得还很不全面，很不深入，运动中的缺点还很多。所有这些，还有待于进一步地加强和改进。我们的任务，就是要在现有的基础上，进一步地依靠和发动群众，把增产节约运动深入地开展起来，以保证完成国家所交给的光荣任务。辽宁省是国家工业建设重点地区之一，同时又是国防前线，敌人的破坏活动，几年来一直是猖狂的。因此，我们在社会主义建设的同时，必须百倍提高警惕，加强对一切反革命分子的破坏活动作坚决的斗争，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，以保证社会主义建设和国防的巩固。我们相信：在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在本次会议所决定的五年计划的鼓舞下，在苏联和各人民民主国家的真诚无私的援助下，依靠全体人民的共同努力，我国的第一个五年计划一定能胜利完成。
    余亚农代表的发言
    这次大会即将通过的以社会主义工业化为中心的、以发展重工业为重点的第一个五年计划，它是一个伟大的、正确的发展国民经济的计划，它是代表着全国人民长远利益和根本利益的计划，我完全拥护。我是从农业经济居多的安徽省来的，从地方的角度来说，我们必须发挥地方经济的潜在力，发挥农民生产的积极性，以便充分满足工业发展的需要和农民本身的需要。因此，我相信安徽人民也将同全国人民一样竭尽全力，积极支援国家工业化的建设。
    安徽是一个历史上多灾的省份，解放后的几年，安徽人民除了要和全国各地一样地去完成各项任务之外，还得用最大的力量去战胜各种自然灾害。今后，如何根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，结合安徽多灾这一特点来进行工作，特别是要保证完成和超额完成农业生产计划，乃是安徽人民在完成第一个五年计划中最迫切的任务。所以，我想着重谈一谈安徽一年来的生产救灾工作。过去一年，是安徽解放以来灾情最大最重的一年。去年夏季遭到百年来未有的洪水；入秋又天旱两个多月；冬季连续不断地落了十昼夜的大雪，平地积雪三尺多深；今春由于阴雨多，部分地区连续下了四次冰雹，春荒情况曾一度扩大。夏淹、秋旱、冬雪、春荒，这就是一年来生产救灾最严重的四关。
    为了战胜自然灾害，中国共产党安徽省委员会和省人民委员会领导全省人民，首先进行了特别紧张而艰巨的防汛抢险工作。在江堤和淮堤上，动员人力、物力、财力之多是空前的；仅人力一项，投入的干部、民工、部队就有二百多万人。洪水过后，又进行了排水、堵口、复堤和农田水利工程，整个冬修和春修一共完成了一亿九千七百多万方土。
    其次，是抓紧了农业生产，特别是粮食生产的工作。全省开展了晚秋补种运动，从增加晚秋收成来弥补受淹减产的损失。虽然去年灾情特殊严重，但粮食生产比起过去受灾年份仍有超过。并且还扩大了冬种面积，使午季粮食作物播种面积扩大到五千五百多万亩，比去年增加了八百一十多万亩；午季粮食收获比去年增加了十四亿多斤。而副业生产的发展，节约度荒工作的加强，也使灾情大为减轻。
    第三、是进行了规模巨大的救济工作。总计由中央拨给的救灾款达一万零四百六十二万元，用于发放救济粮折合人民币六千零十万元，发放棉衣八十三万六千八百件，灾民得到转移和安置的达五百零五万人，为灾民重建房屋达一百八十六万三千二百多间；灾民们特别感激的是政府组织了一万零六百多中西医生给他们治病；而灾民们更想不到的是，政府在寒冬腊月、冰天雪地中，在淮河上搭了三座浮桥，帮助灾民从雪中转移耕牛，把八万三千多头耕牛转移到几百里以外的非灾区去就草喂养。由于这一切工作，使安徽人民基本上度过了灾情困难，做到了救灾不饿死人的要求。这一成绩的取得，是与中央的正确领导和全国人民的大力支持分不开的。在这里，我代表安徽人民，对于中央和全国人民的关怀和支援，表示最深切的感谢！中央和全国人民给予我们的支持和温暖，将进一步激励我们的信心，永不疲倦地去战胜一切灾害，把我们伟大祖国的一个部分，从各种自然灾难中逐步完全解脱出来。
    要胜利地向前推进我们的建设事业，必须完全实现第一个五年计划，为保证第一个五年计划的完全实现，我们又应当进一步改进我们的工作作风，努力克服我们工作中的各种缺点和错误。拿安徽来说，就我所知，虽然生产救灾、“三改”工作和其他各项工作都取得了很大的成绩，但其缺点和错误还是很多的。以生产救灾工作来说，单纯依赖救济的偏向还没有完全克服；在救济工作中还存在忽紧忽松的现象；有些地区对重灾区重视了，但对轻灾区注意不够，以至有些轻灾区反由轻变重，给工作增加不少困难。以粮食统购统销来说，有些地区还存在很不正常的现象，对于闹供应粮食的人，及时加以分析和处理做得不够，造成粮食浪费。其实，在非灾区真正缺粮的是极少数，假叫喊的则是多数。像黟县四联镇有六十二户叫喊缺粮，天天找干部闹供应，经过实地检查，真正缺粮的只有五户，假叫喊的达百分之九十二。寿县双桥区大圩选区三月间带头闹供应的三户富农，原说不得了，要饿死了，经过检查，三户富农共二十二口人，尚存有小麦二千零三十四斤，大口小口平均每人还有九十二斤多，不仅够吃，而且有余。其次，在基本建设和行政经费的开支方面，也发现不少浪费现象。如基本建设中盲目地加大安全系数，高估造价，宽打窄用也是有的。再拿治安情况来说，目前在干部中存在严重麻痹思想，对反革命分子的破坏，没有给以及时的、有力的打击，致使反革命分子的活动愈来愈猖狂。这些反革命分子有的发展特务组织，阴谋暴动；有的破坏国家经济建设，破坏互助合作组织；有的制造谣言、动摇人心，甚至实行暗杀放毒，煽动群众，制造骚乱。去年一年即发生暗杀事件一百四十起，杀死杀伤我干部和积极分子一百五十人。可见敌人是无时无刻不想破坏我们的革命事业的，我们必须提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，坚决肃清一切公开和暗藏的反革命分子，所有这些，说明了现在比任何时候都更需要开展批评与自我批评，揭发我们工作中的缺点，并密切联系群众，接受群众的监督，我认为这是胜利完成第一个五年计划的有力保证。
    各位代表：中国共产党曾经领导我们赢得革命的胜利，今后也一定会领导我们完全实现第一个五年计划。经过几个五年计划，把我们国家建成一个高度工业化的社会主义社会，使我们的子孙后代永远过着幸福的生活。因此，我对于第一个五年计划就像对中国共产党一样，是完全信赖的，忠实拥护的，誓以全力在党和政府领导下，为完全实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    马约翰代表的发言
    对于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，我是完全拥护的，而且我内心里也感到非常的兴奋和激动。这个计划具体地说明了我们国家的伟大的和光辉的前途，以及人民未来的生活幸福。从小组讨论和学习中，我深深地体会到，这个计划是经过了详细的研究，是有调查统计的科学根据的。但是同时，我也深深地感觉到，要完成这个伟大的计划，是一项重大而艰巨的任务。
    党和政府在前面领导着我们，我们全国人民要集中我们的力量在党和政府的领导下，为完成五年计划而奋斗。
    人民的健康，是经济建设中的重要的基本力量之一。这几年来，人民健康水平，是有显著的进步和提高。但是从国家一切建设发展的情况来看，保健工作还是比较落后的。例如：在高等学校中肺病尚未消灭；神经衰弱、失眠等病患者，仍占相当的比例数字；因为不健康，抵抗力弱，而患伤风、头痛等病者，为数也不少。
    健康不仅是说一个人身体没有毛病，而且要有耐久的劳动力量。譬如说，我们每天工作八小时，能够完成而不感疲倦，倘若需要我们加班加点，这时候有人顶得住；有的人就顶不住了。不够健康，就没有足够的精力，就会影响工作。
    健康的人，精神总是饱满的，精力旺盛而充沛，时刻是愉快的、乐观的，是热爱工作、艰苦地劳动、不畏难、不退缩、勇于克服困难、永远前进、为实现理想生活而奋斗的。
    各位代表同志一定要问，健康怎么得来的呢？毛主席早已指示我们：发展体育运动，增强人民体质。只要我们经常地从事体育活动，我们的健康就会得到改善和增强。生理学上已经证明，从事运动，就会使身体器官组织得到锻炼和发展，坚韧而有力，反之就会衰退而软弱无力。
    毛主席的指示，是正确的、科学的。要增强体质，获得健康，锻炼身体是一项重要的措施。体育锻炼的方式很多，在这里我要介绍劳卫制运动。这也是一项苏联的先进经验，它在开展群众体育运动、提高人民健康水平方面，起了很大作用，是一种优越的制度。在我们国家里，已经开展推行这一运动，全国青年都已热烈地参加了这一运动。
    由于体育运动的开展，对于增产节约起了很大的作用。例如：“新体育”杂志曾经报道过，由于厂矿展开了工间操等体育运动，因而增强了工人同志们的健康，减少了生病率，提高了出勤率，并且提高了个人的工作效率。这就是由于开展体育运动，提高健康水平，而达到增产节约目的的有力证明。
    总之，在第一个五年计划执行的同时，还应该重视人民健康水平的提高。增强体质，搞好健康，单单依靠开展体育运动，还不能达到目的，必须在卫生和医疗方面做些工作。例如：过去的爱国卫生运动，基本上消灭了苍蝇，这就是一个伟大的成就，对人民的健康起了很好的影响。为了增强人民的体质和健康，卫生、医疗和体育部门应该订定具体计划，为保证五年计划的实现而努力。尤其希望各机关、厂矿、学校的领导同志，对于健康问题给予正确的领导和支持。
    国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫的发言
    我完全同意我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和国务院李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理向大会做的几个报告。
    第一个五年计划是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个重大步骤，它的实现将把我国向社会主义社会的目标推进一步，同时也将使我国各少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化的建设事业得到进一步的发展。
    几年来，中国共产党和人民政府在各少数民族中进行了贯彻民族平等，加强民族团结，实行民族区域自治，培养民族干部及发展经济和文化等一系列的工作，得到了很大的成绩。
    截至目前为止，我国已建立了民族自治地方七十二个，其中自治县四十五个，自治州和自治区二十七个。新疆维吾尔自治区将于最近成立，西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立工作也正在进行；这两件大事，标志着我国推行民族区域自治的政策，又获得了新的重大成就。
    几年来，各少数民族地区的经济和文化得到了相当的发展，已经有力地支援了祖国社会主义建设事业。在农业方面，各少数民族地区的粮食和技术作物的产量都普遍提高了，仅据内蒙古自治区、桂西僮族自治区和新疆省三个地区统计，一九五四年粮食产量达一百七十七亿余斤，较一九五二年增加了百分之十六点九。在畜牧业方面，据内蒙古自治区、新疆省和青海省三个地区统计，一九五四年各种牲畜头数为四千八百七十多万头，较一九五二年增加了百分之三十点二，其他少数民族牧业区的牲畜头数也有增加。在贸易方面，据不完全统计，一九五四年全国少数民族地区的国营商业机构为二千三百四十个，较一九五一年增加了百分之一百七十八；收购总值达八万一千七百多万元，较一九五一年增加了百分之五百一十二；销售总值达十一万二千六百多万元，较一九五一年增加百分之四百七十八。在交通方面，全国少数民族地区已经修成和正在修筑的公路共二十二条，里程总计在一万公里以上，由中央拨付的国家投资即达二万一千九百多万元。少数民族地区的地方工业，也正在逐步地发展，很多过去没有工业的地方，开始出现了工业。在文化教育方面，一九五四年全国少数民族地区的各级学校达二万六千余所；学生总数达二百六十六万一千余名，较一九五二年增加百分之七十。一九五四年用少数民族文字出版的新书达八百三十五种，八百七十三万册。在医疗卫生方面，一九五四年少数民族地区的综合医院共有六十五所，病床四千六百张，较一九五三年增加百分之九十四。在培养干部方面，中央和地方共创办了七个民族学院，在学校中和工作中培养的少数民族干部已达十多万人。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划体现了我国各民族人民长远的最高利益。在第一个五年计划中，有些重大的建设工程，如包头的钢铁企业，新疆的有色金属工业和石油工业，兰新铁路和集二铁路等，是分布在少数民族地区的。这些规模巨大的建设在迅速的改变着当地社会经济的面貌，给全国和当地各族人民带来了巨大的利益，因此当地各族人民应尽一切努力，来支援这些建设。但是，在第一个五年计划期间，并不是在所有的少数民族地区都有这种重大建设的。这是因为重大的建设，不仅需要大量的资金和技术力量，需要有资源情况的科学资料，而且还必须具备现在可以去进行这种建设的其他方面的许多条件。在我国目前，特别是在我们许多少数民族地区尚不完全具备这些条件的情况下，我们只能够也只应该进行重点建设，而决不应不顾条件，分散资金和技术力量，企图所谓“处处工业化”，不然就会给我们国家的社会主义建设带来很大的困难和损害。所有五年计划中的重大建设项目，不论分布在那里，都是我国各族人民的共同财富，是我国各族人民繁荣和幸福的基础。我国的少数民族地区，大都有着极为富饶的资源，根据国家适当地分布工业生产力，使工业接近原料、燃料的产区和消费地区，并使工业的分布适合于巩固国防的条件，逐步提高落后地区经济水平等原则，可以预计，在国家的重工业建设奠定了一定基础之后，国家就有了可能也就一定会在少数民族地区进行更多的工业建设，那时各少数民族地区工业的发展速度，就一定不是很慢而是很迅速的。至于某些少数民族地区，由于不具备必需的条件，不宜于在那里发展工业，那末按照国民经济各部门配合发展的规划，国家也一定要注意发展那里的农、牧、林业和其他生产的。在五年计划中对于少数民族地区地方工业的建设，对于农、牧、林业生产的发展以及文化教育、医药卫生事业的发展等，都有着适当的规定。可见第一个五年计划是充分地照顾了全国各少数民族地区建设的需要。
    我国各少数民族人民在伟大的五年计划的指引下，应该充分发挥自己的积极性，艰苦奋斗，支援祖国的建设，在我们伟大祖国的建设中来建设我们本民族的地方。某些少数民族地区，从解放到现在所进行的经济、文化建设工作还比较少，在五年计划的后几年中，我们所最迫切需要的一些建设事业，应该尽可能地设法多作一些，而且每一件都应该努力办好。各有关的上级地方国家机关，应该在这些方面给少数民族地区更多的关怀和帮助。
      一些尚未完成民主改革的少数民族地区，为了进行建设，对于民族内部某些旧制度的改革是必要的，因为如果长期地任何民主改革也不进行，那末发展本民族地区的经济、文化是有困难的。有些地区已经在人民群众和同人民群众有联系的公众领袖们的意愿下，逐步地稳妥地进行了多少不同的改革，这是很好的。今后少数民族地区的民主改革，仍必须根据各少数民族的不同历史条件，按照人民群众和同人民群众有联系的公众领袖们的意愿，稳妥地去进行。同时也希望这些民族地区的公众领袖不断地努力学习，力求进步，和本民族人民团结起来，对某些旧制度的必要的改革，采取积极主动的态度。
    为了胜利完成五年计划，加强少数民族地区的建设工作，我们必须积极响应中国共产党中央和国务院的反对浪费厉行节约的号召，坚决认真地执行中央一切反对铺张浪费和全面节约的规定。各少数民族人民都必须知道，为要建设我们的地方，国家的帮助固然是必需的，不可缺少的；但还必须要我们自己克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，不然也是不可能的。目前有些少数民族的人民中还有挥霍浪费的现象，也有的地区还存在着一些不利于发展生产的习惯，这都应该在提高群众觉悟的基础上逐步加以改变。
    现在，各种隐藏的和公开的反革命分子，还在千方百计地企图破坏我们伟大祖国的统一和各民族的团结，破坏我们的各项建设事业。从潘汉年的反革命事件和胡风反革命集团事件的揭露，我们必须吸取深刻的教训。为了更有保证地实现第一个五年计划，我们必须教育干部和人民，提高警惕，加强对反革命分子的斗争，必须坚决地镇压一切反革命分子。
    几年来，我们祖国的社会主义建设事业的伟大成就，包括各少数民族地区的政治、经济、文化的发展在内，是在各民族间的相互信任和团结不断增强的基础上获得的。但是我们必须知道，妨碍民族团结的大民族主义和地方民族主义及其残余还在不同程度上存在着，彻底消除这种民族主义思想及其残余是要经过长期的努力的。各民族的亲密团结是在我国建成社会主义的一个重要条件。为了实现我国的第一个五年计划，我们还必须不懈地继续增强各民族间的团结和兄弟般的友谊。
    李富春副总理关于五年计划的报告发表以后，全国各少数民族人民一致表示热烈的拥护，并纷纷表示实现这个伟大计划的决心。在五年计划执行的前两年中，各少数民族人民已经在实践中表现了他们的这种意志。相信全国各民族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，今后将更加紧密地团结起来，为实现我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗！
