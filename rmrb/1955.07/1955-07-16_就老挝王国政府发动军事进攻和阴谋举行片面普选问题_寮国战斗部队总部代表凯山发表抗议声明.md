Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 15th: Kaysone, representative of the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces, issued a statement on July 10th protesting the Lao Kingdom government's launch of new military offensives against the Lao Fighting Forces and its conspiracy to hold general elections without the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces.

The statement listed facts illustrating the Lao Fighting Forces' ardent desire for national peaceful unification and strict adherence to the spirit of the Geneva Accords, which enabled the political conference between the Kingdom government and the Lao Fighting Forces to be convened in January 1955. On January 18th, the two delegations issued a joint statement stating that both sides recognized the need to simultaneously implement the Geneva Armistice Agreement and resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation. However, a few days after the release of this joint statement, the Kingdom government interrupted the political conference and launched an offensive against the Lao Fighting Forces in U Tay and U Neua in Phong Saly Province on January 27th, and from January 28th to March 4th, it attacked the Lao Fighting Forces in Muong Peun in Sam Neua Province.

The statement said that, through the efforts of the Lao Fighting Forces, the two sides signed an agreement on March 9th, guaranteeing the cessation of all hostile actions, but ten days later, on March 19th, the Kingdom government continued its offensive against Muong Peun. From June to the beginning of July this year, the Kingdom government mobilized many regular battalions from Xieng Khouang and Bon Bun, advancing to occupy eleven strongholds of the Lao Fighting Forces southeast of Muong Peun.

The statement said that, at the same time, the Kingdom government implemented a policy of terror in the ten provinces under its control, stifling the people's democratic freedoms and retaliating against former resistance personnel and patriotic people. Since the ceasefire, the Lao authorities have committed over one hundred acts of terror.

The statement then condemned the Kingdom government for violating its declaration at the Geneva Conference and conspiring to hold general elections without the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces. The statement pointed out that the speech given by Kingdom government Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith to the National Assembly on June 26th openly demanding the surrender of the Lao Fighting Forces was in complete violation of the Geneva Accords.

The statement also condemned the Kingdom government for violating the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces as regroupment zones for the Lao Fighting Forces and that each party should respect the territory under the other's military control, gradually encroaching on the two regroupment provinces of the Lao Fighting Forces, and recently mobilizing troops to launch fierce and large-scale offensives against the Lao side's two regroupment provinces.

The statement emphasized that the above facts prove that the Kingdom authorities, instigated by U.S. imperialism, deliberately create chaos in order to wantonly undermine the Geneva Accords. The Lao authorities, while launching offensives, slander the Lao side in an attempt to deceive the people at home and abroad, and to cover up its treacherous conspiracy to sabotage the political conference, conduct elections without the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces, and undermine the unification of Laos.

The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces finally called on the people of the whole country and the Lao Fighting Forces to unite closely as one, to fight for the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, to defend peace and to realize the unification of the motherland. The Lao Fighting Forces resolutely demand that the Lao authorities cease their military offensives against the Lao Fighting Forces, demand sincere negotiations based on the principle of mutual concession between the two sides, and demand the organization of free general elections with the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces. The statement said that the issue of general elections must be resolved simultaneously with the issue of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, because holding general elections and unifying the administration of these two provinces are two sides of the issue of unifying the country.

    就老挝王国政府发动军事进攻和阴谋举行片面普选问题
    寮国战斗部队总部代表凯山发表抗议声明
    新华社河内十五日电　寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在七月十日发表声明，抗议老挝王国政府对寮国战斗部队发动新的军事进攻，并且阴谋举行没有寮国战斗部队参加的普选。
    声明列举事实，说明寮国战斗部队热望国家和平统一和严格履行日内瓦协定的精神，这样的精神使王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方的政治会议得以在一九五五年一月份召开。一月十八日，双方代表团发表联合声明表示，双方认识到有必要同时实行日内瓦停战协定，并且通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题。但是，在这个联合声明发表后几天，王国政府就中断了政治会议，并且在一月二十七日在丰沙里省乌西、乌怒发动进攻，从一月二十八日到三月四日又在桑怒省芒奔进攻寮国战斗部队。
    声明说，在寮国战斗部队的努力下，双方在三月九日签订了协议，保证停止一切敌对行动，但是十天以后，即三月十九日，王国政府又继续向芒奔进攻。今年六月份到七月初，王国政府又调动许多正规营从川圹和本班前进，占领了芒奔东南寮国战斗部队的十一个据点。
    声明说，与此同时，王国政府在它控制下的十省实行恐怖政策，扼杀人民的民主自由权利，对前抗战人员和爱国人民实行报复。从停战以来，老挝当局所犯的恐怖事件已经有一百多件。
    声明接着谴责王国政府违背它在日内瓦会议上所发表的声明，阴谋举行没有寮国战斗部队参加的普选。声明指出，王国政府首相克特六月二十六日在国民议会上公然要求寮国战斗部队投降的讲话是完全违反日内瓦协定的。
    声明也谴责王国政府违背日内瓦协定关于以丰沙里、桑怒两省为寮国战斗部队集结区以及每一方应尊重对方军事控制下的领土的规定，逐渐侵占寮国战斗部队的两个集结省份，最近又调集军队，向寮国方面的两个集结省份发起猛烈的和大规模的进攻。
    声明强调指出，上述事实证明了王国当局受美帝国主义的唆使，蓄意制造混乱局面，借以蛮横无理地破坏日内瓦协定。老挝当局一面进攻，一面诬蔑寮国方面，企图欺骗国内和世界人民，并且掩饰它的破坏政治会议，进行没有寮国战斗部队方面参加的普选和破坏老挝统一的背信弃义的阴谋。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部最后在声明中号召全国人民和寮国战斗部队紧密地团结成一个整体，为要求正确履行日内瓦协定、保卫和平和实现祖国的统一而斗争。寮国战斗部队坚决要求老挝当局停止对寮国战斗部队方面的军事进攻，要求按照双方互让的原则举行诚意的谈判，要求组织有寮国战斗部队方面参加的自由普选。声明说，普选问题必须和丰沙里、桑怒两省的问题同时解决，因为举行普选和统一这两个省的政权的问题是统一国家问题的两面。
