　  Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 7th (TASS dispatch): U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on the 6th.
    Eisenhower, when talking about the upcoming Four-Power Summit Conference in Geneva, said that the United States is attending the conference with an attitude of reconciliation and friendship, and that the United States does not intend to reject anything out of prejudice or unreasonableness.
    Eisenhower, when talking about the issue of disarmament, pointed out that the main problem in this regard is inspection and supervision. For the United States, the key to this issue is what kind of supervision it is prepared to agree to. Eisenhower said that the U.S. government is studying this issue very seriously and hopes to find an answer to it.
    Eisenhower said that in order to achieve practical results in disarmament, it is necessary to achieve international trust. He said that the current goal of the United States is "to find transitional ways to build international trust as a foundation for lasting peace."
    Eisenhower said that, in his view, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, to be held in Geneva on August 8th, "is very important."

　  艾森豪威尔谈四国会议和裁军问题
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社华盛顿六日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔在六日举行记者招待会。
    艾森豪威尔谈到即将在日内瓦举行的四大国政府首脑会议时说，美国是抱着和解和友好的态度去出席会议的，美国不打算由于偏见或者蛮不讲理而拒绝任何东西。
    艾森豪威尔谈到裁军问题时指出，这方面的主要问题是视察和监督。对美国来说，这个问题的关键是它准备同意什么样的监督。艾森豪威尔说，美国政府正在十分认真地研究这个问题，并且希望对这个问题找到答案。
    艾森豪威尔说，要在裁军方面取得实际的效果，就要获致国际间的信任。他说，现在美国的目的是“寻找过渡的办法来建立国际间的信任，以作为永久和平的基础”。
    艾森豪威尔说，在他看来，将于八月八日在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议“是十分重要的”。
