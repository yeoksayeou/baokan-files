Xinhua News Agency, Lausanne, July 7th (Reporter Lin Ning): The World Mothers' Congress is about to open here today. More than a thousand delegates from seventy-eight countries are arriving one after another. The Chinese delegation, headed by Li Dequan, has arrived in batches. Madame Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Popova, head of the Soviet delegation, Mrs. Felton, Chairman of the British Women's Assembly, and Park Chung-ae, head of the delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have all arrived. They come from all corners of the world, with the common aspiration of allowing children to grow up in a peaceful and happy environment. They have gathered together to discuss the issues of close concern to hundreds of millions of mothers around the world - protecting children, opposing war, striving for disarmament, and international friendship.

This beautiful city, nestled between mountains and water, is at a suitable season for tourism with cool weather. The mountains around Lake Geneva are shrouded in a light mist in the morning and evening. Local women, carrying their children, are constantly going to the station to welcome the mother delegates from afar. They hand bouquets of flowers to the delegates, expressing their respect for the mothers who are working hard for the noble cause of defending children.

Among the arriving delegates are outstanding figures in the women's movement and the world peace movement, female scientists, writers and artists, female engineers, ordinary female workers and rural women, childcare workers, housewives and mothers of many children. This is a grand gathering of mothers from a wide range of social strata from all over the world.

    世界母亲大会开会前夕
    新华社洛桑七日电　本社记者林宁报道：世界母亲大会今日就要在这里开幕了。七十八个国家的一千多名代表正陆续来到。以李德全为首的中国代表团已经分批到达。国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人、苏联代表团团长波波娃、英国妇女大会主席费尔顿夫人、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长朴正爱等已先后抵达。她们来自世界的各个角落，怀着让孩子们在和平幸福的环境中成长的共同心愿。她们聚集到一起，来商讨当前全世界亿万母亲们所密切关怀的问题——保护孩子、反对战争、争取裁减军备和国际友好。
    这座依山傍水的美丽的城市，正值适于游览的季节，天气凉爽。莱蒙湖畔的山峦在清晨和晚间被笼罩在一片薄雾中。当地妇女们携带着她们的孩子，不断到车站去欢迎远道而来的各国母亲代表们。她们把一束束的鲜花送到代表们的手里，表示她们对于为保卫孩子这个崇高的事业而努力的母亲们的敬意。
    在到来的代表中，有妇女运动和世界和平运动中的杰出人士，有女科学家、作家和艺术家，有女工程师、普通女工和农村妇女，有儿童保育工作者，有家庭妇女和多子女的母亲们。这是世界各国广泛阶层母亲们的一次盛大集会。
