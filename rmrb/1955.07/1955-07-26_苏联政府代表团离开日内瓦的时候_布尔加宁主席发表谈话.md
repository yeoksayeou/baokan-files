    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th (TASS dispatch) - The Soviet Government delegation attending the Four-Power Summit Conference left Geneva on the morning of the 24th.
    Bulganin, head of the Soviet Government delegation, made a statement at the airport, saying:
    As the Soviet delegation prepares to leave Geneva, it extends its warmest gratitude to the Swiss government and the Geneva authorities for their attention and care during the Soviet delegation's stay here. We will retain the most heartfelt memories of this attention and care.
    The Soviet delegation also expresses its gratitude to the residents of Geneva, who have received us so warmly, and extends to them heartfelt greetings and best wishes.
    In recent days, the attention of people all over the world has been focused on Geneva. The Geneva Conference will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the international situation.
    At the conference, we sincerely devoted ourselves to seeking ways to build trust between nations, without which people cannot be confident about their future.
    It cannot be expected that the Geneva Conference will solve all the problems that need to be solved at once. There is still much work to be done in this regard. However, it should be said that the achievements already made in Geneva have opened a new stage in the relations between the four countries (and not only between them).
    All of this will help to ease international tensions, consolidate international peace, and eliminate the threat of a new war.
    The Soviet government, for its part, will do its utmost to implement the Geneva decisions and continue the work that has begun in Geneva.
    Upon leaving Geneva, Bulganin wrote a letter to the President of the Swiss Confederation, Petitpierre, expressing gratitude for the hospitality of the Swiss people and government.

    苏联政府代表团离开日内瓦的时候
    布尔加宁主席发表谈话
    新华社二十四日讯　塔斯社日内瓦二十四日讯：出席四国政府首脑会议的苏联政府代表团在二十四日上午离开日内瓦。
    苏联政府代表团团长布尔加宁在机场发表了谈话说：
    苏联代表团就要离开日内瓦了，谨向瑞士政府和日内瓦当局表示热烈的感谢，感谢他们在苏联代表团停留在这里的期间对它的注意和关怀，我们对这种注意和关怀将保持最热切的回忆。
    苏联代表团还要向如此热诚款待我们的日内瓦市居民表示感谢，向他们致以衷心的问候和最好的愿望。
    最近几天来全世界人民的注意都集中在日内瓦。日内瓦会议无疑将对国际局势发生良好的影响。
    在会议上我们曾经真诚地致力于谋求建立一种国与国之间的信任的途径，没有这种信任人们是不能够对自己的前途放心的。
    不能指望日内瓦会议一下子解决所有需要解决的问题。在这方面还有许多工作需要做。但是，应该说，在日内瓦已经取得的成就在四国之间（而且不仅仅在它们之间）的关系中开辟了一个新阶段。
    所有这一切都将有助于缓和国际紧张局势、巩固国际和平和消除新战争威胁。
    苏联政府这一方面将竭尽全力来贯彻日内瓦的决定，把在日内瓦开始的事业继续下去。
    布尔加宁在离开日内瓦时写信给瑞士联邦主席彼蒂彼爱，对瑞士人民和政府的招待表示感谢。
