    Resolutely Oppose All Forms of Waste
    Institutions of Higher Education Should Not Make Reckless Plans When Ordering Goods from Abroad
    A reader who wished to remain anonymous visited the reader's letters department of this newspaper and reported that he recently participated in the review of the 1956 foreign order forms for institutions of higher education and found that many institutions of higher education had plans for ordering goods from abroad that were excessively high, excessively large, and unrealistic.
    Some orders were for excessive quantities, far exceeding actual needs. For example, "radium," a very rare element, is usually measured in "milligrams," but Henan Normal College wanted to order fifty grams.
    "Spectroscopic photographs" have an effective lifespan of only half a year, but Yunnan University and Northeast People's University each ordered seventy dozen (each sheet can be cut into five or six pieces when used), which one school simply cannot use up in half a year. For example, the Metal Physics Teaching and Research Section of Peking University ordered two types of "thermocouple wire," ten kilograms of each, worth 90,000 rubles; this is also more than they actually need.
    Some orders are not for urgently needed items, and some are even currently unusable. For example, the "infrared spectrograph" and electron microscope ordered by Nankai University are not required for teaching in general institutions of higher education; these are very valuable instruments, with an "infrared spectrograph" costing 150,000 yuan and each electron microscope costing 90,000 yuan. For example, Shanxi Normal College ordered ten microscope lamps, which can actually be replaced by fluorescent lamps. The stereoscopic microscopes that Northeast Normal University wanted to order (originally ten, now reduced to seven) are not needed for general teaching work; if used for scientific research, one or two would be sufficient.
    Some items can be manufactured domestically, but were still ordered from abroad. For example, aluminum rods for holding platinum wires and gas lamps (also known as Bunsen burners) can be purchased everywhere in China, and rotary vacuum pumps can also be produced in large quantities domestically, but some colleges and universities still want to order them from abroad.
    If these unrealistic order plans are not revised in time, they will cause huge losses to the country. It is recommended that the Ministry of Higher Education strictly review and approve these order plans based on the principles of practicality and economy.
    Editor's note: The Ministry of Higher Education believes that the reader's report is correct. In order to save state funds, the Planning Department of the Ministry of Higher Education has proposed four principles for reviewing this batch of order forms: 1. All items that can be produced domestically must have their orders cancelled; 2. Orders for items that are not urgently needed or are not needed at all should be cancelled; 3. Orders for excessively large quantities or those with significantly different original estimates should be cancelled; 4. Orders for items that are estimated to have no current usage conditions should be cancelled. It is hoped that relevant institutions of higher education will reduce existing order plans based on these four principles, and that they will pay attention to saving state funds when formulating procurement plans in the future and prevent similar deviations from recurring.

### 坚决反对一切浪费现象  高等学校向国外订货时不应该乱提计划

    坚决反对一切浪费现象
    高等学校向国外订货时不应该乱提计划
    一位不愿发表姓名的读者访问本报读者来信部，反映他最近参加审查高等学校一九五六年国外订货单的工作，发现不少高等学校向国外订货的计划都有偏高偏大、不切实际的现象。
    有些订货数量太多，大大超过实际需要量。例如“镭”这种极为稀少的元素平常是以“毫克”作为计算单位的，而河南师范学院却要订购五十克。
  “光谱照片”的有效使用期限只是半年，云南大学和东北人民大学却各订购了七十打（使用时每张可裁为五、六张），一个学校在半年内是根本用不了的。又如北京大学金属物理教研室订购“热电偶丝”两种，每种十公斤，价值九万卢布；实际上也是不需要这么多的。
    有些订货并不是急需的东西，甚至是目前用不着的。例如南开大学订购的“红外线摄谱仪”、电子显微镜等仪器，都不是一般高等学校教学所需用的；这些都是非常贵重的仪器，一台“红外线摄谱仪”价值达十五万元，电子显微镜每台价值九万元。又如山西师范学院订购显微镜照明灯十台，实际上用日光灯就可以代替。东北师范大学要订购的实体显微镜（原要十台，现已撤销七台），一般教学工作中根本用不着；如果作科学研究工作，只要一两台也就足够了。
    有些物品国内可以自行制造，但也向国外订购了。例如，夹白金丝用的铝杆和煤气灯（又名本生灯）国内到处可以买到，旋转真空泵国内也可以大量生产，有些院校却还要向国外订货。
    这种不切合实际的订货计划，如果不及时修订，将会给国家造成巨大的损失。建议高等教育部根据实用和节约的原则严格地审查和核批这批订货计划。
    编者按：高等教育部认为读者反映的情况是正确的。为了节约国家的资金，高等教育部计划司已提出审核这批订货单的四项原则：一，凡是国内能生产的物品，一律撤销订货；二，目前不太需要和根本不需要的订货，应予撤销；三，订货数量太多或与原估价相差太大的，应予撤销；四，估计目前没有使用条件的，应予撤销。希望有关高等学校根据这四项原则，缩减现有的订货计划，并且在今后制定采购计划的时候必须注意节约国家的资金，防止类似偏向重复出现。
