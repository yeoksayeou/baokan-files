Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 3rd – Militias in various parts of Fujian Province are actively cooperating with People's Liberation Army troops to strike at small armed groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandits harassing our coastal areas and to capture lurking secret agents.

Since last December, militias in coastal areas of Fujian have, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army or in independent operations, annihilated or repelled ten small armed groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who landed to carry out harassment, captured alive twelve American-Chiang armed special agents and Chiang Kai-shek soldiers fully equipped with American weapons, and seized a quantity of rifles, pistols, and military supplies. Recently, the Fujian Provincial People's Committee and the Fujian Military Region jointly issued a circular commending the militias of Daihou Township in Zhangpu County and Baitang, Zhenhai, and Xincuo Townships in Haicheng County for repelling two groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandits on May 20th and June 14th. The circular praised the militias in these areas for their bravery and composure in combat and called on militias and fishermen in coastal areas to learn from them, increase their vigilance, and work with the Chinese People's Liberation Army to firmly defend the motherland's coastline.

During frequent air raids and artillery bombardments by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the militias remained steadfast at their posts, day and night, to protect the interests of the masses. In January, eight Chiang Kai-shek aircraft frantically bombed and strafed peaceful residents in a certain area. Liu Lin, the local militia company commander, and Sun Ke'guo and Lin Xiami, the squad leaders, braved the flying shrapnel to direct the masses to take cover and monitor the activities of bad elements, while rescuing the wounded residents and providing bandages and first aid. In Xiamen and Dadan, frontline outposts of coastal defense, the militias continued to lead the masses in production as usual, despite the constant threat of artillery bombardment by Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

Militias in the inland areas of Fujian are also vigilantly assisting the government in maintaining local public order. In the past six months, militias in inland and coastal areas of Fujian have assisted the government in capturing a total of forty-six counter-revolutionaries, arsonists, and thieves engaged in sabotage activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 2nd – The people of coastal Fujian who have suffered from the scourge of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops have received proper resettlement and sincere care from the government.

After Nan'an County farmers Hong Xiuqin, Li Shuishao, and two others were injured by artillery fire from Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen Island on May 16th, the local stretcher team immediately carried them to the dressing station for emergency treatment. The Second Hospital of Jinjiang Prefecture also dispatched an ambulance to the scene and transported three of the seriously injured to Quanzhou City for treatment. All three have now recovered and been discharged from the hospital. After fisherman Liu Faxing from Fuding County was injured by gunfire from Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships, he was also promptly transported by a stretcher team to a hospital in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, for treatment.

Local governments and relevant departments have also assisted the affected people in overcoming difficulties and restoring production. On June 13th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships opened fire and destroyed twelve civilian houses in Weitou Township, Jinjiang County. The local government immediately allocated more than 500 yuan for relief. The local people also vacated their houses and lent furniture, farm tools, and clothing to the affected residents, enabling them to quickly resolve their production and livelihood difficulties. On June 6th, after Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft sank and damaged fishing boats in Meigang and Shenhu Townships, Jinjiang County, the local government not only allocated funds to subsidize the affected fishermen in restoring production, but also hired carpenters and stonemasons to repair the fishing boats and install air defense facilities on the boats. Supply and marketing cooperatives also promptly supplied the affected fishermen with a large number of boat repair materials, enabling them to repair their boats in a timely manner.

　　福建各地民兵在对敌斗争中有很大贡献
　　沿海遭受蒋贼祸害的人民受到妥善安置
    新华社福建前线三日电　福建省各地民兵配合人民解放军部队积极打击骚扰我沿海地区的蒋贼军小股武装、捕捉潜伏特务。
    去年十二月以来，福建沿海各地民兵在协同人民解放军部队或单独作战中，共歼灭或击退登陆骚扰的蒋贼军小股武装十股，活捉全副美械装备的美蒋武装特务和蒋贼军十二人，并缴获长短枪及军用物资各一部。最近，福建省人民委员会和福建军区联合发出通令，嘉奖在五月二十日和六月十四日击退两股蒋贼军的漳浦县岱后乡和海澄县白塘、镇海、新厝等乡的民兵。通令表扬了这些地区的民兵们在战斗中的英勇沉着，并号召沿海各地民兵和渔民向他们学习，提高警惕性，和中国人民解放军一起巩固地保卫祖国的海防。
    在蒋贼军频繁的空袭和炮击中，民兵们不分白天黑夜，始终严守岗位，保卫群众利益。一月间，有八架蒋贼飞机疯狂轰炸扫射某地和平居民。当地基干民兵队长刘麟和小队长孙可国、林吓妹等，冒着纷飞的弹片一面指挥群众隐蔽和监视坏分子的活动，一面抢救被炸伤的居民，进行包扎急救。在海防前哨的厦门、大嶝一带，民兵们还照常带领群众在蒋贼军不断炮击的威胁下坚持生产。
    福建内地的民兵也同样警惕地协助政府维护地方治安。半年来，福建内地和沿海各地民兵协助政府捕获进行破坏活动的反革命分子和纵火、盗窃犯共四十六名。
    新华社福州二日电　遭受到蒋贼军祸害的福建沿海人民，受到政府的妥善安置和亲切关怀。
    南安县农民洪秀琴、李水梢等四人在五月十六日被金门岛蒋贼军炮兵打伤后，当地担架队马上把他们抬到包扎所急救，晋江专区第二医院并派出救护车赶到出事地点，把其中三个受重伤的人运到泉州市治疗。现在，这三个人都已伤愈出院。福鼎县渔民刘发兴被蒋贼军舰艇上的炮火打伤后，也及时由担架队运到浙江省温州市的医院里进行治疗。
    各地政府和有关部门还协助受难人民克服困难和恢复生产。六月十三日，贼军舰艇开炮打毁了晋江县围头乡的十二所民房，当地政府立刻拨款五百多元予以救济。当地人民也纷纷挪出房屋，并借给受难居民家具、农具和衣服，使他们很快解决了生产和生活的困难。六月六日，蒋贼飞机打沉、打伤晋江县梅港乡和深沪乡的渔船后，当地政府除拨款补助受难渔民恢复生产外，并雇了木工和石工为渔民修理渔船和在船上设置防空设备。供销合作社也及时供应受难渔民大批修船材料，使他们能及时修好船只。
