Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 10th – The National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front issued a statement on the 9th, warmly welcoming the joint communiqué of the Vietnamese and Chinese governments on behalf of the people of Vietnam.

The statement said that for half a month, the Vietnamese people have been watching every activity of President Ho Chi Minh and the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during their visit to great China. The grand, warm, and cordial reception by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people deeply moved the Vietnamese people. Today, the people of the whole country are even more delighted to learn that the governments of Vietnam and China signed a joint communiqué on July 7th. This communiqué clarifies the consensus of the two governments on major issues concerning the relations between the two countries and the international situation.

The statement pointed out that in the joint communiqué, the government of the People's Republic of China demonstrated a noble and responsible spirit in realizing the Geneva Accords. The statement said that the Vietnamese people see in the joint communiqué the clear position of the two governments on issues concerning the two countries and the world, which is also the line of struggle of the Vietnamese people, reflecting the deep aspirations of the Vietnamese people. It illustrates the sincere sympathy and support of the fraternal Chinese government and people in the struggle of the Vietnamese people for peace and unification.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people thank the Chinese people for their generous and selfless assistance, which previously inspired the Vietnamese people to be self-reliant and promote the war of resistance, and now further inspires the Vietnamese people to actively consolidate peace and realize the struggle for unification. The statement pointed out that the friendship and sincere mutual assistance between Vietnam and China are also an important contribution to maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

The statement said that in the face of this assistance, the Vietnamese people will work harder to strive for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, promote the struggle to demand consultation meetings to discuss general elections, and strive to consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects. The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that with the active help of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, the Vietnamese people will surely win the victory of the political struggle.

The statement concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people remember President Ho's teaching: "The friendship and close relationship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples is eternal and unbreakable, and cannot be separated or obstructed by anyone." The Vietnamese people once again wish the friendship between Vietnam and China to be eternally deep and profound, and wish the Chinese people to overfulfill the first five-year plan and build a prosperous and strong China, a strong fortress of peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 10th – Shi Shan, acting president of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, issued a written statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 9th regarding joint communiqué of the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic Republic Vietnam.

Shi Shan said that when I learned on the 8th that the Chinese and Vietnamese governments had issued a joint communiqué, I felt extremely happy and excited. I think this is an event of historical significance. Every sentence and every word of the joint communiqué expresses the will of the two governments and peoples to unite and struggle for the principles of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world and against the conspiracies of aggression and instigation of war by US imperialism and its followers. The joint communiqué proves that the People’s Republic of China is very concerned about its responsibility to guarantee the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, and proves that 600 million Chinese people warmly support the Vietnamese people. It is a strong backing for the Vietnamese people’s struggle to achieve the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords. The active support of 600 million Chinese people, coupled with the sympathy of the people of all countries in the world, is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people, which makes us fight more firmly to consolidate peace and realize unification.

Shi Shan continued, saying that during the years when the Vietnamese people were engaged in arduous resistance against imperialist aggressors, the glorious example of the Chinese people’s struggle and the friendship and support of the Chinese people were a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. Since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the Chinese government and people have made many efforts to help the Vietnamese government and people heal the wounds of war. Today, the government of the People’s Republic of China has once again given a huge sum—800 million yuan RMB—unconditionally to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which once again demonstrates the generous and selfless help of the Chinese government and people to the Vietnamese people. This assistance is for the common benefit of the two peoples, and such assistance can only exist between countries in the socialist and people’s democratic camp that have a fraternal and unbreakable friendship. It is completely different from the practice of US imperialism, which uses “aid” as a cover to try to invade and enslave countries.

Shi Shan said that the Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that the Chinese government's special concern for and firm guarantee of the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina will be a force to advance the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and a powerful blow to the conspiracy of US imperialism and its servants to deliberately sabotage the Indochina armistice agreement.

Shi Shan finally said that the Vietnamese people guarantee to continue to closely and strengthen solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. This indestructible solidarity will help the Vietnamese people to develop the spirit of self-reliance and complete the struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy victoriously under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    越联战线全国委员会欢迎中越联合公报
    越中友协代会长诗山就中越联合公报发表谈话
    新华社河内十日电　越南国民联合战线全国委员会在九日发表声明，代表越南全国人民热烈欢迎越中两国政府的联合公报。
    声明说，半个月以来，越南人民每天都在注视着胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府代表团在伟大的中国访问的每一个活动。毛泽东主席、中国共产党、中国政府和人民的隆重、热烈和亲切的接待，使越南人民无限感动。今天，全国人民更加欢欣地获悉越中两国政府在七月七日签订了联合公报。这一公报阐明了两国政府在有关两国的关系问题和国际局势的重大问题上的一致性。
    声明指出，在联合公报中，中华人民共和国政府表明了要在实现日内瓦协定方面高尚的、负责的精神。声明说，越南人民在联合公报中看到两国政府在有关两国和世界各项问题中的明显立场，这个立场也是越南人民的斗争路线，它反映了越南人民的深切愿望。它说明了兄弟般的中国的政府和人民在越南人民的和平和统一的斗争中的热诚的同情和支持。
    声明说，越南人民感谢中国人民慷慨无私的援助，这个援助以前曾鼓舞了越南人民自力更生、推进抗战，现在更加鼓舞了越南人民积极巩固和平、实现统一的斗争。声明指出，越中两国间的友谊和真诚的互相帮助，也是对维护东南亚和世界和平的一个重要贡献。
    声明说，面对着这种帮助，越南人民将更加努力为和平、统一、独立、民主而奋斗，促进要求举行协商会议以讨论普选的斗争，努力从各个方面来巩固北越。越南人民深信，在苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的积极帮助下，越南人民必将取得政治斗争的胜利。
    声明最后说，越南人民铭记着胡主席的教导：“越中两国人民的友谊和密切关系是永恒的、牢不可破的，是任何人所不能离间和阻挠的”。越南人民再度祝越中友谊永恒深厚，并且祝中国人民超额完成第一个五年计划，建设一个富强的中国、一个亚洲和世界的和平的坚强堡垒。
    新华社河内十日电　越中友好协会代理会长诗山九日就中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府的联合公报向新华社记者发表了书面谈话。
    诗山说，当我在八日获悉中越两国政府已发表联合公报时，我感到无比高兴和激动。我认为这是有历史意义的事件。联合公报的每一句、每一字都表示两国政府和人民为世界各国和平共处的原则和反对美帝国主义及其追随者进行侵略和挑拨战争的阴谋而团结斗争的意志。联合公报证明了中华人民共和国非常关心自己对保证正确地履行日内瓦协定的责任，证明中国六亿人民热烈支持越南人民，它是越南人民争取日内瓦协定得到正确履行的斗争的
  一个坚强的后盾。中国六亿人民的积极支持，再加上世界各国人民的同情，是对越南人民的莫大的鼓舞，它使我们为巩固和平、实现统一而更加坚强地进行斗争。
      诗山接着说，在越南人民进行艰苦抗战、反对帝国主义侵略者的年月里，中国人民光辉的斗争典范、中国人民的友谊和支持，对越南人民就是一个很大的鼓舞。自从越南和平恢复以来，中国政府和人民为帮助越南政府和人民医治战争创伤又作出许多援助。今天，中华人民共和国政府又把巨大的款项——人民币八亿元无偿地赠送给越南民主共和国政府，这再次表现中国政府和人民对越南人民的慷慨无私的帮助。这个帮助是为了两国人民的共同利益，这样的帮助是只有在社会主义和人民民主阵营中具有兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊的国家之间才能有的。它与美帝国主义以“援助”为掩护设法侵入和奴役各国的做法是完全不一样的。
    诗山说，越南人民深信，中国政府对日内瓦协定在印度支那的彻底履行的特别关心和坚决保证将是一个推进越南人民的斗争的力量，并且是对美帝国主义及其仆从蓄意破坏印度支那停战协定的阴谋的有力打击。
    诗山最后说，越南人民保证继续密切和加强与苏联、中国及其他兄弟国家的团结。这种不可摧毁的团结将帮助越南人民发挥自力奋斗的精神，在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明的领导下胜利地完成为和平、统一、独立民主的斗争。
