Before the start of the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai, along with Vice-Premier Chen Yi and Vice-Premier Ulanhu, greeted the peace representatives from various countries. When Japanese peace activist Ikuo Oyama, who had visited China before, entered the hall, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with him for a long time.

In the hall where the reception was held, the peace representatives from various countries once again met with the Chinese representatives who had participated in the World Peace Conference with them, and they greeted each other warmly. Song Qingling, a famous Chinese peace activist, talked with a female representative from Argentina about women's issues. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, talked with the Japanese peace representatives at the same table. When Li Dequan met with Japanese representative Ryuko Oyama, they warmly kissed each other in greeting.

After the reception began, the guests and hosts sat around the tables, conversing in Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Spanish, French, English... talking about the impressions of the peace representatives visiting China, talking about peace and friendship, and frequently rising to toast to peace and to each other's health.

At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai walked to each table with a smile on his face to talk with the peace representatives from various countries. Premier Zhou and the peace representatives from various countries toasted to peace and friendship. Wherever Premier Zhou Enlai went, there was applause and laughter.

A female representative from Cuba presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a photo of a tombstone built to commemorate the Cuban independence struggle in which overseas Chinese participated long ago. The photo recorded the deeds of the overseas Chinese in this struggle, and the photo read: "No Cuban overseas Chinese is a deserter, no Cuban overseas Chinese is a traitor." Premier Zhou Enlai accepted the gift and shook hands with the representative cordially.

Premier Zhou Enlai came to the table of two female representatives from Argentina who were wearing Chinese qipaos. The two representatives happily told Premier Zhou that they wore Chinese-style clothes to express their respect for the Chinese people.

At the table with several Japanese peace representatives, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands and talked with Matsuyama Mikiko, the representative who staged the Chinese opera "The White-Haired Girl" in Japan in the form of ballet, and introduced Wang Kun, the Chinese opera actress who played "The White-Haired Girl", and movie actress Tian Hua, to meet Matsuyama Mikiko.
