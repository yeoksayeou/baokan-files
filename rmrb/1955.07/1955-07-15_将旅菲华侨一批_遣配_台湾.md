Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Manila: The Philippine authorities, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, on the 3rd again "deported" 37 overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines to Taiwan. Together with the first batch of overseas Chinese "deported" to Taiwan at the end of April, there are now 74 people.

These "deported" overseas Chinese were part of more than 140 stranded Chinese who had been imprisoned in the Engineering Island prison for a long time. Most of them were imprisoned again in the Engineering Island prison awaiting deportation after serving their sentences for violating Philippine ordinary criminal or civil laws.

The more than 140 stranded Chinese imprisoned on Engineering Island began a three-day hunger strike on March 28, demanding that the Philippine authorities release them. They also published a "Tearful Appeal of the Stranded Prisoners in the Water Prison" in February, accusing the Philippine authorities of inhuman treatment. The appeal stated that they did not want to be "deported" to Taiwan, because they knew that Taiwan would bring them nothing but a more miserable fate.

    菲律宾当局同蒋贼勾结
    将旅菲华侨一批“遣配”台湾
    据新华社讯马尼拉消息：菲律宾当局在同蒋贼的勾结下，又于三日将我旅菲华侨三十七名“遣配”往台湾。连同四月底第一批被“遣配”往台湾的华侨已有七十四人。
    这些被“遣配”的华侨是被长期监禁在工程岛牢狱里的一百四十多名难侨中的一部分。他们大多是因为触犯菲律宾普通刑事或民事法律而在服刑期满后再被投入工程岛监牢待解出境的。
    被禁在工程岛监牢里的一百四十多名难侨曾于三月二十八日开始举行了为期三天的绝食，要求菲律宾当局释放他们。他们还在二月间发表了“水牢难侨泣告书”，控诉菲律宾当局给予他们的非人待遇。泣告书说，他们不愿被“遣配”往台湾，因为他们知道，台湾带给他们的不是别的，而将是更加悲惨的命运。
