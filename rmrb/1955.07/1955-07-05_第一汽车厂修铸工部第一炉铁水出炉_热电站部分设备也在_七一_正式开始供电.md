　　The First Automobile Works Repair and Foundry Department Produces First Furnace of Molten Iron
　　Power Station's Partial Equipment Also Officially Begins Supplying Electricity on "July 1st"
    On July 1st, the cupola of the Repair and Foundry Department of the Non-Ferrous Repair and Foundry Workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant emitted a deafening roar. The bright red molten iron in the cupola flowed into the iron ladle. The workers were overjoyed and cast the molten iron into sand molds. This was the first furnace of molten iron they produced.
    The Repair and Foundry Department of the Non-Ferrous Repair and Foundry Workshop is one of the auxiliary production departments of this factory, producing various steel and iron castings required for process and transportation equipment. The workshop's technical equipment all adopts the latest Soviet designs. It can produce castings needed for special machine tools, as well as appliances and iron shot for producing clean castings.
    At present, while production preparations are being carried out intensely at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the rapid entry into production of the Repair and Foundry Department is of great significance for the timely supply of various equipment and tool castings urgently needed in production preparations.
    In recent days, under the help of Soviet experts, the employees of the Repair and Foundry Department have enthusiastically launched complex and arduous production preparation work. Although equipment such as sand mold and core drying machines have not yet been installed, the workers have created temporary drying equipment to make sand molds and cores, ensuring early commencement of work.
    On the afternoon of July 1st, all preparation work was completed. Workers joyfully climbed onto the cupola and hung a huge banner that said, "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" The employees used it as a gift to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the Party's birth.
    The power station of the Power Center of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, some of its equipment had already generated electricity on the afternoon of June 30, and officially began supplying electricity on July 1.
    This power station is responsible for supplying the heat and electricity for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In this power station, all the modern automated equipment mainly supplied by the Soviet Union has been installed. Duty personnel can understand the operation of various parts in front of the control panel. If a certain part is about to malfunction, various signals will remind the duty personnel to pay attention. If an accident occurs, the relevant equipment will automatically stop, and the backup equipment will immediately be put into production, so that the operation will not be interrupted due to an accident.

　　第一汽车厂修铸工部第一炉铁水出炉
　　热电站部分设备也在“七一”正式开始供电
    七月一日，第一汽车制造厂有色修铸车间修铸工部的鼓风炉发出震人的轰鸣，冲天炉里的鲜红铁水，滚滚流入铁水罐里。工人们又欢欣鼓舞地把铁水铸入砂型内。这是他们生产的第一炉铁水。
    有色修铸车间修铸工部是这个厂辅助生产部门之一，它生产工艺和运输设备上所需要的各种钢铸件和铁铸件。车间的技术装备都是采用苏联最新设计。它能生产特种机床所需要的铸件，以及生产清净铸件用的器具、铁丸等。
    目前在第一汽车制造厂紧张地进行生产准备时，修铸工部能够很快地投入生产，对于及时供应生产准备中所迫切需要的各种设备、工具的铸件有重要意义。
    修铸工部的职工们，连日来在苏联专家的帮助下，热烈地展开了复杂、艰巨的生产准备工作。虽然砂型、砂芯的烘干机等设备还没有安装，工人们竟创造出临时的烘干设备做好砂型、砂芯，保证提前开工。
    七月一日下午，准备工作全部就绪，工人们兴高采烈地爬上冲天炉挂上了“中国共产党万岁！”的巨幅标语，职工们用它作为向党诞生三十四周年纪念的献礼。
    第一汽车制造厂动力中心的热电站，部分设备已经在六月三十日下午发电，并在七月一日正式供电。
    这座热电站担负供给第一汽车制造厂的热和电的任务。在这座热电站里，装置了主要由苏联供给的全部现代化自动化的设备。值班人员站在操作盘前就可以了解各部分的运转情况。如果某一部分将要发生毛病，各种信号都会提醒值班人员注意。如果发生了事故，有关设备就会自动停下来，备用的设备又马上投入生产，不致因为发生事故而使运转中断。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
