Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th – According to the Korean Central News Agency's Kaesong dispatch: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 14th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the chief representative of the Chinese and Korean side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, announced that the Korean and Chinese side agreed to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's proposal to temporarily change the port inspection teams. He also suggested to the US side that if the US side also agreed, then the secretariat should be authorized to draft a reply to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission expressing agreement. In a letter to the Military Armistice Commission dated May 3, 1955, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission suggested temporarily canceling the inspection teams stationed at the ports of Gangneung and Gunsan in southern Korea and the ports of Chongjin and Hungnam in northern Korea. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also suggested to both sides of the Military Armistice Commission that the members of the existing Neutral Nations inspection teams be reduced from four to two.

	At the meeting, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that considering the above-mentioned four ports are not used by both signatories to the Armistice Agreement for rotation and replacement purposes, our side does not consider this measure of temporarily canceling the inspection teams at these four ports as changing the legal status of these ports as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, as long as the right to dispatch inspection teams to these ports for inspection in the future when necessary is retained. This step cannot be considered as reducing the tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, nor as an obstacle to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in performing the duties given to it by the Armistice Agreement.

	However, at the meeting, the US side once again trotted out its set of old logic that had long been refuted and exposed, and repeatedly repeated slanders that were irrelevant to the current issue, attempting to avoid discussing the issue. The US side also rehashed old tunes, making big slanders against the Korean and Chinese side, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Commission.

	At the meeting, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao once again demanded that the US side should immediately stop the unreasonable slanders against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, respect the Commission's contribution to consolidating the Korean Armistice, and actively cooperate with the Commission's work. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao cited a variety of established facts to further and thoroughly expose that it was the US side itself that was blatantly violating the Armistice Agreement and obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

	Finally, the Korean and Chinese side expressed agreement to postpone the meeting to July 16 as proposed by the US side.

    中立国监察委员会建议暂时改变口岸视察小组
    李相朝在军事停战委员会会议上表示同意
    新华社平壤十五日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在军事停战委员会十四日的会议上宣布：朝中方面同意中立国监察委员会关于暂时改变口岸视察小组的建议。他同时向美方建议：如果美方也同意，那么便授权秘书处拟订致中立国监察委员会的表示同意的答复。据中立国监察委员会在一九五五年五月三日致军事停战委员会的信件中建议暂时取消驻扎在朝鲜南部的江陵和群山两个口岸和朝鲜北部的清津和兴南两个口岸的视察小组，中立国监察委员会还向军事停战委员会双方建议，把现有中立国视察小组中的组员由四名削减到两名。
    李相朝中将在会议上指出：考虑到上述的四个口岸未为停战协定签字双方作为轮换和替换之用，我方并不认为暂时取消这四个口岸的视察小组的这种措施是改变停战协定所规定的这些口岸的合法地位，只要保留在将来有必要时派遣视察小组到这些口岸进行视察的权力。这种步骤不能认为是削减中立国监察委员会的任务，也不是对中立国监察委员会执行停战协定给予它的职责的障碍。
    但是，美方再度在会议上搬弄它那一套早已被击破和揭穿的陈旧逻辑，一再重复跟目前这个问题无关的诽谤，企图避免讨论这个问题。美方并且重弹老调，大事诽谤朝中方面、中立国监察委员会和委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员。
    在会议上，李相朝中将再次要求美方应立即停止对中立国监察委员会进行的毫无道理的诽谤，尊重委员会为巩固朝鲜停战作出的贡献，并且积极地对委员会的工作进行合作。李相朝中将引述已经确定的种种事实，进一步彻底揭露，公然违反停战协定和阻挠中立国监察委员会工作的正是美方自己。
    最后，朝中方面表示同意把会议延期到美方提议的七月十六日再举行。
