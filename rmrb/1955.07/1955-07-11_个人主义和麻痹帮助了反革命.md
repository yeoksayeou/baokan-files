    Individualism and Complacency Help Counter-Revolution
    Wu Tian
    Hu Feng and his followers are cunning and deceitful. They appear in various guises and change at any time. Their conspiracies and schemes are hidden under the cloak of disguise, and our shortcomings and mistakes often become "gaps" for the enemy to attack us. This is something that deserves our vigilance!
    I have seen some Hu Feng elements who are fierce-looking, seemingly "bold and unrestrained," and "dare to speak" (Wang Rong is an example); there are also Hu Feng elements who are taciturn, seemingly very "honest," always having some "unique insights," and cultivating themselves to be "superior to others" (Lu Ling is an example); there are also Hu Feng elements who always have a smile on their faces, "work hard," and live frugally, making people feel like they are "approachable" (Huang Ruohai is this kind); and there are also Hu Feng elements who use the signboard of "experts and scholars," talking nonsense and swindling everywhere, scaring young people... I believe there must be more forms, more tricks, and more changes. However, the Hu Feng elements I have personally come into contact with are enough to illustrate the problem.
    If we can calmly look back, we can easily find that there are indeed clues to be found: their double-dealing, their stirring up trouble, their instigating destruction, their pulling-in activities, their antagonistic organizations, and their hatred for the people's revolutionary cause.
    It is impossible for the enemy not to show his true colors, but because of our麻痹negligence and carelessness, we turn a blind eye and do not investigate, so we lightly let them get away with it. In this way, they mixed into the revolutionary ranks and carried out counter-revolutionary criminal activities.
    How worthy of our vigilance! Complacency, liberalism, and carelessness have become synonymous with "helping counter-revolution"!
    What is even more serious is that those who are dissatisfied with the organization and always harbor strong individualism are prone to unknowingly becoming their captives.
    Any shortcomings or mistakes in our work can become a good opportunity for the enemy to exploit. Because the enemy is always "observing the direction" and preparing to attack.
    Comrades, how should we be vigilant! We must always remember the two-faced activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary gang. We must not forget this matter.
    This is a bloody lesson. All upright people will feel this way.
    We must thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. It must be thorough, clean, and deep.
    We must make all hidden counter-revolutionary elements show their true colors and be tried before the people. We must leave all counter-revolutionary elements with nowhere to hide!

    个人主义和麻痹帮助了反革命
    吴天
    胡风和胡风分子是狡诈多端的。他们以各式各样的姿态出现，并且会随时改变。他们的阴谋暗算包藏在伪装的外衣之下，而我们的缺点和错误常常成为敌人向我们进攻的“缺口”。这是多么值得我们警惕的事！
    我曾见过有一种胡风分子，张牙舞爪，看起来好像“大胆泼辣”，“敢于说话”（王戎就是一个例子）；又有一种胡风分子，沉默寡言，好像很“老实”，总有什么“独到之见”，修养“高人一等”（路翎就是一个例子）；又有一种胡风分子，总是面带微笑，“埋头工作”，生活刻苦，让人觉得好像“平易可亲”（黄若海就是这一种）；还有一种胡风分子，打着“专家、学者”的招牌，满口胡说八道，到处招摇撞骗，吓唬青年人……我相信一定还有更多的形式，更多的花样，更多的变化。可是，就我亲自所接触的这些胡风分子，尽够说明问题了。
    如果我们能够冷静地回顾，我们就不难发现，这里面确有蛛丝马迹可寻：他们的两面三刃，他们的挑拨是非，他们的煽动破坏，他们的拉拢活动，他们的对抗组织和仇视人民革命事业。
    敌人不可能不露出他的马脚，只是由于我们的麻痹大意，视若无赌，不加追究，就这末轻轻地让他们混过去了。这样，他们就混进革命的队伍里，进行反革命的罪恶活动。
    多末值得我们警惕啊！麻痹、自由主义、马虎大意成了“帮助反革命”的代名词！
    还有更严重的，是那些对组织不满、老是怀着浓厚的个人主义的人，就容易不知不觉地成了他们的俘虏。
    凡是我们工作上的什么缺点或错误，随时可以成为敌人钻空子的好机会。因为敌人总是“窥测方向”，准备进攻的。
    同志们，我们该如何警惕啊！我们要永远记住反革命匪帮胡风集团的两面派活动。我们不能忘了这件事。
    这是一个血的教训。凡是正直的人都会这样感觉到的。
    我们必须肃清胡风反革命集团。要彻底、干净、深入。
    我们要使所有暗藏的反革命分子现出原形，在人民面前受审。我们要让一切反革命分子无地容身！
