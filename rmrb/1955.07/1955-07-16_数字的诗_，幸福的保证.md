    "Poetry of Numbers," A Guarantee of Happiness
    National People's Congress Representative Ba Jin
    When Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun delivered the "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" at the Second Session of the National People's Congress, the entire venue was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. The representatives were all burying their heads in the reports spread out before them. After a period of intense concentration, there was suddenly a rustling sound of pages turning like wind blowing through leaves, or a burst of thunderous applause like spring thunder. Everyone exhaled excitedly, looked up at the podium, and Chairman Mao was also applauding in his seat. The strong lights flashed for a moment, the photographers were busy for a while, and then the entire venue quieted down again, and everyone's heads were buried in the reports. We followed Comrade Li Fuchun's serious voice towards the beautiful prospect of socialist industrialization. His report led our hearts all over the country. We not only saw the current face of our country more clearly, we not only recognized the real strength of our country more clearly, but also saw the more glorious future of our country, and the better future of our people. In front of our eyes appeared boundless fertile fields and industrial cities with rows of chimneys, and in our ears rang songs, laughter, the sound of hammers, the sound of sickles, and all kinds of vibrant sounds. The report on the First Five-Year Plan brought us into such a rich, vast, and glorious world. It brought us so much joy and so much confidence. I simply couldn't stop my heart from pounding. When I heard the specific figures indicating a significant increase in production, when I saw the charts illustrating the huge scale of construction, when I heard Comrade Li Fuchun solemnly announce: "We are doing great things for the happiness of the people of the whole country and future generations," I really wanted to run out of the venue and grab everyone I met to report this great good news. I believe that every representative has such warm and deep feelings, and the representatives over seventy years old will not be calmer than the representatives around twenty years old. When people see the light of happiness shining in front of them and know that the hopes of many years are about to gradually become a reality, their selfless joy is the same. Therefore, it is imaginable that more than 1,100 representatives welcomed Comrade Li Fuchun's report with stormy applause. While applauding enthusiastically, we also looked around with smiles, we were willing to see each other's happy expressions, we felt more clearly than ever that our hearts were indeed connected, forming a huge force, fighting for a great common goal.
    I am one of these more than 1,100 representatives. At this moment, I didn't think about the "past," I only thought about the "present" and the "future," especially the "future" full of sunshine and beautiful scenery.
    But when reading the draft of the Five-Year Plan, and when discussing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, the shadow of the "past" often appeared before my eyes. From some figures, from some charts, I saw the dark, painful days of the "past," those years wasted in being enslaved and exploited. Simple figures tell us what the rulers of the past did for the people. Simple figures also tell us how much brilliant achievements New China has made in six years. The output of grain, the output of cotton, the output of steel, the output of coal, the construction of railways, the construction of industry... which figure does not illustrate the leaping progress in just a few years and the glorious prospect of the future, two and a half years later we will have four thousand self-made trucks; when the plan is completed, we will even have an annual output of ninety thousand vehicles. The days of the past are gone forever. Every figure in the draft proves this fact to us. These figures have extremely rich content. In the past, people liked to say: "Dry and tasteless numbers." But now the numbers in front of us can all speak. They can tell many touching stories. They can draw many beautiful pictures. At a group discussion, a representative pointed to the draft of the Five-Year Plan and said: "This is the poetry of numbers." He said it well.
    I once said this: "Poetry should give people the joy of creation, poetry should spread life." But these numbers also concentrated the feelings of 600 million people and embodied the common wishes of 600 million people. They not only spread life and joy, they not only describe a happy future for us, but also provide a definite guarantee for this happiness. They are also guideposts for 600 million people, they will correctly and step by step lead us to the road of socialism. They illuminate 600 million hearts like bright lights.
    We repeatedly read the draft of the Five-Year Plan and discussed Comrade Li Fuchun's report, and everyone felt that they had a lot to say, but they didn't know where to start, and how could they finish saying it. But everyone has a very clear feeling: we are getting closer and closer to socialism, as if we can touch it with a hand. At the same time, everyone also has a feeling: the achievements of these years have not been easily obtained, this is the result of the diligent and conscientious hard work of the people of the whole country under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. Even if socialism is close at hand, without the long-term arduous efforts of the people of the whole country in the future, a bright future is only within reach but unattainable. For the infinitely bright future, for the happiness of future generations, who would not be willing to dedicate all their strength? Who would not be willing to work selflessly?
    Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are doing extremely glorious and great things that our predecessors have never done before." This "poetry of numbers" alone can guarantee that this extremely glorious and great cause will be accomplished. This is a concrete guarantee. What a great encouragement it is to the people of the whole country. It is easy to understand how much joy and confidence it brings to the people of the whole country. It is also easy to understand that the people of the whole country are excitedly talking about it and are ready to greet it with practical actions. Indeed, for every Chinese who has stood up, is there anything more glorious today than striving to complete the Five-Year Plan?
    But in the general joy, no one forgets the arduous efforts and sharp struggles. Glorious and great undertakings can only be accomplished through such efforts and struggles. A representative said well: "Our victory is the enemy's failure. Our happiness is the enemy's disaster." Therefore, it is also imaginable that our enemies, the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, will try every means to sabotage our cause. Today, when we are meeting in Beijing, our internal and external enemies are making slanderous cries and malicious speculations in many dark corners. We have already heard their trembling voices. They are terrified because our country is becoming increasingly powerful. In the future, various counter-revolutionaries will use more frantic sabotage activities to save their demise. Of course, their demise is irreversible. But their sabotage will also bring us losses. In order to protect our glorious and great cause, we must heighten our vigilance and give the enemy a fatal blow in resolute struggle. I believe that when attacking the enemy, no Chinese hand is willing to lag behind.
    Then let us cheer and applaud to our heart's content for our First Five-Year Plan, this "poetry of numbers," this guarantee of happiness. Let our enemies tremble when they hear our universal cheers and enthusiastic applause.

### “数字的诗”，幸福的保证

    “数字的诗”，幸福的保证
    全国人民代表大会代表　巴金
    国务院副总理李富春在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上作“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”的时候，整个会场静得听不见一声咳嗽，代表们都把眼睛埋在各人面前摊开的报告书上，在
  一阵聚精会神的沉静之后，忽然响起一片风吹树叶般的翻书页的声音，或者一阵春雷似的响亮的鼓掌声。大家兴奋地吐一口气，抬起头看主席台，毛主席也在他的座位上鼓掌。强烈的灯光亮一阵，摄影记者忙一阵，然后全会场又静下来，大家的头又埋在报告书上。我们就这样地跟着李富春同志的严肃的声音走向社会主义工业化的美丽的远景。他的报告引着我们的心走遍了全国。我们不仅更清楚地看见了我们国家现在的面貌，我们不仅更清楚地认识了我们国家的实在的力量，而且我们看见了我们国家的更光辉的前途，和我们人民的更美好的未来。在我们的眼前现出了一望无际的丰饶的原野和烟囱林立的工业城市，在我们的耳边响着歌声、笑声、铁锤声、镰刀声和种种充满生气的声音。第一个五年计划的报告把我们引进了一个多么丰富、多么广大、多么光辉灿烂的世界。它给我们带来多大的喜悦和多强的信心。我简直没法制止我的心的猛跳了。我听到那些表示生产量显著增长的具体数字的时候，我看到那些说明建设规模巨大的图表的时候，我听到李富春同志庄严地宣布：“我们正在做着为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事”的时候，我真想跑出会场拉住我遇见的每一个人报告这个天大的喜讯了。我相信每个代表都有这样热烈、深厚的感情，七十岁以上的代表不会比二十岁左右的代表更冷静。人们看见幸福的光芒在前面闪耀，知道多年来的希望就要逐渐成为事实的时候，他们那种不自私的快乐是相同的。因此一千一百多位代表用暴风雨般的掌声来欢迎李富春同志的报告，这是可以想像到的了。在热烈地鼓掌的时候，我们还带着笑容往四面看，我们愿意看见彼此的幸福的表情，我们比在任何时候都更清楚地感觉到我们的心的确连在一起，结成一个巨大的力量，在为一个伟大的共同目标奋斗。
    我便是这一千一百多代表中间的一个。在这个时候我没有想到“过去”，我只想着“现在”和“未来”，尤其是充满阳光和美景的“未来”。
    但是在阅读五年计划草案的时候，在讨论李富春同志的报告的时候，“过去”的阴影就常常在我的眼前出现了。从一些数目字上、从一些图表上我看到“过去”那些黑暗、痛苦的日子，那些在被奴役和被剥削中浪费了的岁月。简单的数目字告诉我们过去那些统治者究竟为人民作了些什么事情。简单的数目字也告诉我们新中国在六年中间有了多少辉煌的成就。粮食的产量，棉花的产量，钢铁的产量，煤的产量，铁路的修筑，工业的建设……哪一样数字不说明短短几年中间的飞跃的进步和未来的光辉的远景，两年半以后我们就会有四千辆自己造的载重汽车了；等到计划完成我们甚至有九万辆的年产量。过去的日子是一去不复返的了。草案中的每一个数字都向我们证明这一个事实。这些数字都有极其丰富的内容。过去人们喜欢说：“枯燥无味的数字。”但是现在摆在我们眼前的数字都是会说话的。它们可以讲许多动人的故事。它们可以绘出许多美丽的图画。在小组讨论会上一位代表指着五年计划草案说：“这是数字的诗。”他说得真好。
    我从前说过这样的话：“诗应该给人以创造的喜悦，诗应该散布生命。”可是这些数字，还集中了六万万人民的感情，体现了六万万人民的共同愿望。它们不仅散布生命和喜悦，它们不仅给我们描绘了幸福的远景，而且给这幸福作了确实的保证。它们还是六万万人民的指路标，它们会正确地、一步一步地把我们引到社会主义的路上去。它们像明灯一样地照亮了六万万颗心。
    我们反复地阅读五年计划的草案，讨论李富春同志的报告，大家都觉得有满腹的话要说，却不知道从何说起，而且如何才说得完。但是谁都有一个非常明确的感觉：我们离社会主义越来越近了，好像一伸手就可以摸到它似的。同时大家还有一个感觉：这几年来的成就并不是轻易得来的，这是全国人民在党和政府的正确领导下勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业努力工作的结果。社会主义即使近在眼前，可是今后没有全国人民长期的艰苦的努力，美好的未来也只是可望而不可即。为了无限美好的前途，为了后世子孙的幸福，谁又不愿意献出自己的全部力量呢？谁又不愿意忘我地劳动呢？
    毛泽东主席说过：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”单是这一部“数字的诗”就可以保证这个极其光荣伟大的事业是一定会完成的。这是具体的保证。它对全国人民是一个多大的鼓舞。它给全国人民带来多大的喜悦和信心，这是很容易了解的事情。全国人民都在兴奋地谈论它，都准备用实际行动来迎接它，这也是很容易了解的事情。的确，对于每一个站起来了的中国人，难道今天还有比为着完成五年计划而奋斗更光荣的事情？
    但是在普遍的快乐中也没有人忘记艰苦的努力和尖锐的斗争。光荣伟大的事业必须通过这样的努力和斗争才能够完成。一位代表说得好：“我们的胜利就是敌人的失败。我们的幸福就是敌人的灾难。”所以我们的敌人帝国主义者和蒋匪帮会想尽千方百计来破坏我们的事业，这也是可以想像到的事情。今天我们在北京开会的时候，我们的内外的敌人正在许多阴暗的角落里发出诬蔑的叫嚣和恶意的揣测。我们已经听见了他们的战栗的声音。他们因为我们国家的日益强大而感到恐怖了。今后各种反革命分子会用更疯狂的破坏活动来挽救他们的灭亡。固然他们的灭亡是无可挽救的。但是他们的破坏也会给我们带来损失。为了保护我们的光荣伟大的事业，我们必须提高警惕，在坚决的斗争中给敌人以致命的打击。我相信，在打击敌人的时候，没有一个中国人的手是甘愿落后的。
    那末让我们为着我们的第一个五年计划，这部“数字的诗”，这个幸福的保证尽情地欢呼、鼓掌吧。让我们的敌人听见我们的普遍的欢呼声和热烈的鼓掌声而战栗吧。
