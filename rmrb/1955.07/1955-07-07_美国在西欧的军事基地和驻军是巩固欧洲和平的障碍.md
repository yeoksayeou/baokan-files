　　US Military Bases and Troops in Western Europe are an Obstacle to Consolidating Peace in Europe
　　Tan Wenrui
    As the summit of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France is about to be held, the call for strengthening European peace and easing international tensions from the people of European countries is rising. It is becoming increasingly clear that to guarantee peace in Europe by establishing an all-European collective security system, it is first necessary to restore mutual trust between European countries. However, the United States' maintenance of a large number of troops and a network of military bases scattered throughout Western Europe is a major obstacle to building international trust and cooperation.
    Since the end of the war, the United States has used coercive and enticing tactics to obtain the privilege of building military bases and stationing troops in many Western European countries, establishing hundreds of bases and other military facilities on the territory of these countries, and continuously sending naval, land, and air forces to be stationed in Western European countries. The US Department of Defense announced in February of this year that the United States has 950 military bases abroad, most of which are concentrated in Western Europe. According to the US military's "Combat Forces Journal" more than a year ago, the United States has as many as 130 air bases in Western Europe alone. This does not include the more than one hundred airports built by Western European countries under the North Atlantic Treaty, which the United States can use now or in the future. The number of US troops stationed in Western Europe has long exceeded 500,000. This includes five army divisions and five regiments, eighteen air force wings and two guided missile squadrons, as well as the Sixth Fleet based in Western Europe.
    The situation of US bases and troops in several major Western European countries can roughly show how the United States has placed Western Europe under its control and occupation in accordance with its aggressive war deployment.
    On British territory, there are more than 20 US military bases, 14 of which are bases for long-range bombers. The US Third Air Force operational forces stationed in Britain have hundreds of jet fighter-bombers and atomic bombers. There are more than 50,000 American military personnel stationed in Britain. This situation has led American propagandists to call Britain an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the United States. The US armed forces have naval bases, airports, barracks, ammunition depots, and other equipment in 69 of the 90 provinces of France. The United States has virtually turned all of France's major ports into its own naval bases. The United States has also taken possession of many important naval, land, and air force bases in Italy, and has rebuilt these bases according to the needs of US troops, aircraft, and ships. The United States has more than 30 airports in West Germany, more than a dozen of which are air force bases for atomic bombers. The total number of US troops stationed in West Germany is more than 200,000. The United States is also stepping up the construction and expansion of its military bases in Spain, Greece, Norway, the Netherlands, and other countries to strengthen the entire US base network in Western Europe.
    US military bases and troops in Western European countries seriously infringe upon the sovereignty of these countries and disrupt the peaceful lives of the people of these countries. Hundreds of thousands of residents in US-controlled bases have been forced to leave their homes. In West Germany, 700,000 hectares of land have been forcibly requisitioned for the construction of foreign military bases, and 47,000 houses have been requisitioned. In these countries, US military personnel enjoy extraterritorial rights and are not subject to the laws of the host country; at the same time, US garrison authorities also have the power to exercise jurisdiction and trial over residents in the base area. For example, the US military authorities at the Chateauroux Air Force Base in France even issued a notice stating that the US military was ordered to use force against those who refused to obey US instructions. Under the protection and encouragement of extraterritorial rights, the US troops stationed in Western Europe commit crimes and atrocities unscrupulously. In the state of Rheinland-Pfalz, West Germany, in the three and a half years since January 1950, local people have filed nearly 4,000 cases accusing occupying forces of crimes. British newspapers have angrily accused the US military of immoral and overbearing behavior in Britain. Not only that, the United States also uses its troops stationed in Western European countries to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries and suppress the movements of the people of various countries to fight for peace and independence. In 1951, US Deputy Secretary of Defense Lovett openly stated that because of the growing strength of the French people, the United States' powerful military police force must be stationed in France. He also claimed: "If there is unrest in this country, the military police can quickly assist the French police and army." US Marines stationed in Italy regularly conduct exercises to suppress "local riots." The US military is stationed in Western European countries in the posture of occupiers, seriously damaging the national self-esteem of the people of Western European countries. Therefore, in these countries, people universally hate these foreign occupiers.
    In order to cover up the aggressive essence of its establishment of military bases and stationing of troops in Western Europe, the US aggressive bloc has always said that US bases and troops in Western Europe are necessary to defend the security of the "free world" and are aimed at defending against "Soviet aggression." This deceptive trick has been seen through by more and more people in Western Europe. US generals, politicians, and propaganda agencies are increasingly frequently talking about how to use US military bases abroad to launch a so-called "preemptive" atomic war. US Secretary of State Dulles once openly clamored that the United States can "give the Russian heartland a devastating blow" by relying on bases in "various friendly countries bordering the Soviet Union." At the end of last year, Stevenson, commander of the US 49th Air Division stationed in Britain, even announced without reservation that the US Air Force could use Britain as a base to launch atomic bomb attacks on the Soviet Union at any time. This situation shows that the United States is painstakingly trying to make Western Europe a forward position for its prepared atomic war, and the fact that the United States has established military bases and stationed troops in Western European countries has given the US aggressive forces convenient conditions for preparing to launch a war. It can be seen that US bases and troops in Western Europe are a factor of unrest and tension in Europe. It breeds the crisis of a new war, threatens the security of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and also threatens the security of Western European countries.
    Therefore, the more the US aggressive bloc intensifies its preparations for an atomic war, the stronger the desire of the people of Western European countries to abolish US military bases and withdraw US troops. Many social and political groups in Britain have recently held meetings to protest the government's transformation of Britain into a US atomic bomber base, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops and the abolition of these military bases. British Labor Party leader Bevan pointed out that "the argument against US bases is undeniable," and he said that the time has come to end the situation in which Britain has become an "occupied country." The movement to demand the abolition of US bases is also developing in Italy and other Western European countries. Italian General Caponi, in his book "Italy in World Military Policy," condemned the Pentagon's strategy, saying that this strategy is to launch wars on foreign territories and turn foreign territories into its forward outposts. He pointed out that once a war breaks out, the US troops stationed in Italy will become real occupation forces, just like the Germans who occupied Italy in the last war. The Danish people have also launched a strong protest movement against the government's attempt to allow US troops to be stationed at Danish bases.
    In the struggle against the US military's stationing of troops and establishing bases in their countries, the people of Western European countries have received new and great encouragement from the fact that the Austrian State Treaty was concluded. Austria has adopted a policy of not participating in military blocs and alliances and not allowing foreign countries to establish military bases on its territory, establishing its peaceful and independent status. The Austrian example shows Western European countries that it is entirely possible for them not to place themselves under foreign military occupation. Therefore, the Soviet Union's new proposal on May 10 to reduce armaments, which included the abolition of foreign military bases established on the territory of other countries and the withdrawal of the four-nation occupation forces from Germany, was naturally warmly supported by the people of Western European countries.
    The Soviet proposal caused panic in Washington. US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George hurriedly declared that the United States could not "abandon any bases (in Western Europe) or reduce our troops in the near future." At the same time, the United States is also planning to station the troops it will withdraw from Austria in Italy. This can only show that the US aggressive bloc is unwilling to relax its control over Western European countries and is unwilling to allow the situation in Europe to further ease. This attitude is inconsistent with some of the words recently expressed by some US political leaders expressing their willingness to strengthen European peace. At the 10th anniversary of the United Nations, US President Eisenhower expressed his hope that the upcoming four-nation summit would be able to "eliminate the terrible tools and weapons of fear and suspicion that were established after World War II." However, if the United States continues to maintain its military base network and large armed forces in Western Europe, it will be very difficult to establish European collective security and restore international trust. The interests of the security of European countries and the interests of world peace both require the abolition of US military bases in Western Europe and the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Western Europe in order to facilitate the easing of the international situation.

### 美国在西欧的军事基地和驻军是巩固欧洲和平的障碍

　　美国在西欧的军事基地和驻军是巩固欧洲和平的障碍
　　谭文瑞
    苏、美、英、法四大国政府首脑会议即将举行，欧洲各国人民要求加强欧洲和平、缓和国际紧张局势的呼声益形高涨。人们愈来愈清楚地看到，要通过建立全欧集体安全体系来保证欧洲的和平，首先必须恢复欧洲各国之间的相互信任。而美国在西欧保持庞大的驻军和星罗棋布的军事基地网，是建立国际互信和合作的一个重要的障碍。
    战后以来，美国利用威逼利诱的手段，从西欧许多国家取得了修筑军事基地和驻扎军队的特权，在这些国家的领土上建立了数以百计的基地和其他军事设施，并不断增派海、陆、空军驻扎在西欧各国。美国国防部今年二月间宣布，美国在国外拥有九百五十个军事基地，这些军事基地大部分是集中在西欧的。据美国军方的“战斗部队杂志”一年多以前透露，美国在西欧的空军基地就达一百三十处。这还不算西欧国家根据北大西洋公约而建立起来的一百多个飞机场，这些飞机场是美国现在或将来都可以使用的。美国在西欧的驻军早已超过五十万人。其中包括陆军五个师和五个团，空军十八个联队和两个定向飞弹中队，以及以西欧为基地的第六舰队。
    从西欧几个主要国家中美国基地和驻军的情况，就可以概略看出美国按照它的侵略战争部署把西欧置于它的控制和占领之下的情况。
    在英国的领土上，有着二十多个美国军事基地，其中有十四个是远程轰炸机的基地。驻扎在英国的美国第三航空队作战部队拥有上百的喷气式战斗轰炸机和原子轰炸机。驻在英国的美国军事人员在五万人以上。这种情形使美国的宣传家们把英国称作为美国的“不沉的航空母舰”。美国的武装部队在法国九十个省的六十九个省里设有海军基地、飞机场、兵营、弹药库和其他设备。美国实际上已把法国全部主要港口当作自己的海军基地。美国把意大利的许多重要的海、陆、空军基地也占为己有，并按照美国军队、飞机和舰只的需要把这些基地进行改建。美国在西德有三十多个飞机场，其中有十多个是供原子轰炸机使用的空军基地。美国在西德驻军的总数共达二十多万人。美国并且正在加紧在西班牙、希腊、挪威、荷兰等其他国家修建和扩充它的军事基地，以加强美国在西欧的整个基地网。
    美国在西欧各国的军事基地和驻军，严重地侵犯了这些国家的主权，破坏了各国人民的和平生活。成千上万在美国控制的基地上的居民被迫迁离他们的家园。在西德，就有七十万公顷的田地被强征为外国建立军事基地之用，被征用的房屋共四万七千幢之多。在这些国家中，美国的军事人员享有治外法权，不受驻在国法律的约束；同时美国驻军当局还有对基地地区的居民行使管辖和审判的权力。例如法国沙托卢空军基地的美军当局就居然出过告示说：美军奉命用武力对付拒绝服从美国的指示的人。在治外法权的庇护和鼓励之下，西欧的美国驻军肆无忌惮地犯罪行凶，无所不为。在西德莱因—伐尔兹一州，从一九五○年一月以后的三年半期间，当地人民就提出了将近四千件控告占领军人员的犯罪案件。英国的报纸曾愤怒地指控美军在英国的伤风败俗、横行霸道的行为。不仅如此，美国还利用它在西欧各国的驻军来干涉这些国家的内政，镇压各国人民争取和平和独立的运动。在一九五一年，美国国防部副部长罗维特就公开说过：由于法国人民力量的日益增强，所以美国的强大的宪兵队必须驻在法国。他并且声称：“如果在这个国家内发生骚动时，宪兵队能够迅速地对法国警察和军队给予协助。”美国驻在意大利的海军陆战队经常举行镇压“地方居民暴动”的演习。美国军队以占领者的姿态驻扎在西欧国家，严重地损害着西欧各国人民的民族自尊，因此，在这些国家里，人民普遍憎恨这些外国的占领者。
    美国侵略集团为了掩饰它在西欧建立军事基地和驻扎军队的侵略实质，一直说美国在西欧的基地和驻军是保卫“自由世界”的安全所必需的，目的在防御“苏联的侵略”。这种骗人的诡计已为愈来愈多的西欧人民所识破。美国的将军、政客和宣传机构都日益频繁地在谈论如何利用美国在外国的军事基地来发动一场所谓“先发制人”的原子战争。美国国务卿杜勒斯就曾公开叫嚣说，美国依靠“与苏联毗邻的各个友好国家”的基地可以“给俄国的腹地以毁灭性的打击”。去年年底，美国驻在英国的第四十九空军师司令斯蒂文森甚至毫无顾忌地宣布，美国空军利用英国为基地，随时可以对苏联进行原子弹袭击。这种情形说明，美国是处心积虑地要把西欧作为它所准备的原子战争的前哨阵地，而美国在西欧各国建立军事基地和驻扎军队的事实给了美国侵略势力准备发动战争的便利条件。由此可见，美国在西欧的基地和驻军是欧洲不安和紧张局势的因素，它孕育着新战争的危机，威胁着苏联和人民民主国家的安全，同时也威胁着西欧各国的安全。
    因此，美国侵略集团越加紧准备原子战争，西欧各国人民要求取消美国军事基地和撤退美国驻军的情绪也就越加强烈。英国的许多社会和政治团体近来纷纷集会抗议政府把英国变成为美国的原子轰炸机基地，要求美国军队立即撤退和取消这些军事基地。英国工党领袖比万指出：“反对美国基地的论据是无可置疑的”，他并且说：结束英国成为“被占领的国家”的情况的时候来到了。要求取消美国基地的运动在意大利和其他西欧国家中也在发展。意大利的卡波尼将军在他所著的“意大利在世界军事政策中”一书里谴责五角大楼的战略，说这种战略要在外国领土上发动战争，把外国领土变成它的前哨据点。他指出：一旦爆发了战争，驻扎在意大利的美国军队就要变成真正的占领军，正像在上次大战中占领意大利的德国人一样。丹麦人民也展开了强大的抗议运动，反对政府让美国军队在丹麦基地上驻扎的企图。
    西欧各国人民在反对美国在他们国内驻军和建立基地的斗争中，从奥地利国家条约缔结的事实得到了新的巨大鼓舞。奥地利采取了不参加军事集团和联盟、不让外国在它领土上建立军事基地的政策，确立了它的和平独立的地位。奥地利的例子向西欧各国表明，它们不把自己置于外国军事占领之下是完全可能的。因此，苏联五月十日提出的裁减军备的新建议中关于取消外国在别国领土上建立的军事基地和撤退四国驻德国占领军的主张，很自然地在西欧各国人民中受到热烈的拥护。
    苏联的建议引起华盛顿方面的惊惶不安。美国参议院外交委员会主席乔治赶紧声明：美国不能“在最近将来放弃（在西欧的）任何基地或减少我们的部队。”同时，美国还策划把它将从奥地利撤出的军队驻扎到意大利去。这只能说明美国侵略集团不肯放松它对西欧各国的控制，不肯使欧洲的局势获得进一步的缓和。这种态度同一些美国政治领袖最近发表的一些表示愿意加强欧洲和平的言词是不相符合的。在联合国十周年纪念会上，美国总统艾森豪威尔曾表示希望即将举行的四国政府首脑会议能够“消除在第二次世界大战结束后建立的可怖的恐惧和猜疑的工具和武器。”但是，如果美国继续在西欧保持它的军事基地网和庞大的武装部队，建立欧洲集体安全和恢复国际间的信任就要遇到很大的困难。欧洲各国安全的利益和世界和平的利益都要求取消美国在西欧的军事基地，撤退美国在西欧的驻军，以利国际局势的缓和。
