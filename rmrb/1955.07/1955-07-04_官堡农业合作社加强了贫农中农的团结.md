　　Guanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daren County, Shanxi Province, had achieved some successes before 1953 and was commended by higher authorities. Instead of taking this as an encouragement to run the cooperative better, the committee members became complacent. In 1954, the cooperative's more than 5,700 mu of land saw a 36% reduction in production compared to normal years. The county Party committee sent a work group to help the committee find the reasons for the reduction, and the "People's Daily" published a communication on March 28 this year about the lessons learned from the cooperative's production decline. However, at the time, the county Party committee did not effectively help the cooperative improve its work; the committee members did not truly learn any beneficial lessons from it, but instead blamed higher authorities and were unhappy with the criticism. Some said, "When I saw it in the newspaper, my head was on fire." Others said, "If Zhang Shun (the original staff member stationed in the cooperative) were still here, maybe it wouldn't have been published in the newspaper and we wouldn't have been criticized!" Some believed that in the past, Zhang Shun had told them to do things that way, and they hadn't made their own decisions; others felt that being criticized was a loss of face. As a result, they became discouraged.

　　Before sowing this year, the Daren County Party Committee did not strengthen its leadership over the cooperative. The cooperative's spring plowing was even worse than in 1954. In 1954, the cooperative used 18 new-style walking plows for plowing, but this spring, they used old-fashioned farm tools and old farming methods. The cooperative's core members still blindly harbored the emotion to
  "compete with the Chenjia Village Agricultural Cooperative," and they excessively lowered the remuneration for the means of production, regardless of the conditions. The land dividend was fixed at 24% of the normal actual output, and the cooperative members received little remuneration from the land other than paying agricultural tax. The price of livestock joining the cooperative was also lower than the market price. The fertilizer price was originally 20% lower than the market price, and because of the cooperative's production decline last year, it was reduced by another 40% this year. Therefore, the cooperative members were unwilling to accumulate fertilizer, and even when the toilets were full, they did not empty them, drying cow, horse, and sheep manure to burn as firewood instead of contributing it to the cooperative. In addition, it was stipulated that draft animals, vehicles, and farm tools must all be priced and join the cooperative. If a cooperative member's livestock did not join the cooperative, the cooperative would not provide fodder, and they were not allowed to sell or lend it. Cooperative members with livestock had no choice but to reluctantly price their livestock and hand it over to the cooperative. All of these measures made the middle peasant cooperative members dissatisfied with the cooperative, and the relationship between the middle peasant cooperative members and the poor peasant cooperative members became very bad. The middle peasant cooperative members looked down on the poor peasant cooperative members. The poor peasant cooperative members, seeing that the middle peasant cooperative members were unwilling to have their livestock join the cooperative, believed that they were "too backward." Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to stir up trouble, undermining the prestige of the cooperative and the cooperative director everywhere. Seeing this situation, most of the cooperative members were worried about whether the cooperative could be run well and whether production could be increased this year. Some cooperative members were making plans: if production was not increased again this year, they would withdraw from the cooperative. More than 20 cooperative member households planned to go to the city to work and "earn cash."

　　When sowing was about to begin, the county Party committee sent another work group to Guanbao Village to help the cooperative carry out rectification. They first separately summarized the achievements of running the cooperative in the past with the Party members, Youth League members, committee members, and all cooperative members, so that the cooperative's core members could see the past achievements, increase their confidence, and so that the cooperative members could clearly recognize that joining the cooperative was still better than working individually. Then, they organized everyone to discuss "the purpose of the Party's leadership in guiding peasants to take the road of collectivization" and checked it against the cooperative's situation. Through discussion, everyone further clarified that the purpose of running the cooperative was to make everyone prosperous together; one of the main criteria for running an agricultural cooperative well was to increase production and increase cooperative members' income; the most fundamental condition for running an agricultural cooperative well was the close unity of poor and middle peasants. However, the cooperative had reduced production last year, and not only had production not improved this year, but the principle of mutual benefit had not been grasped well. If it continued to be run like this, the cooperative would fall apart and everyone would not be able to live a more prosperous life. After gaining a clear understanding, the cooperative director Li Fu and some other committee members consciously criticized their mistakes of not accepting criticism, and resolved to overcome complacency and discouragement, and run the cooperative well.

　　On the basis of raising awareness, the work group helped them carry out rectification starting with production, first studying ways to improve production. The work group made detailed calculations with all the cooperative members: in Guanbao Village in 1953, the land plowed with new plows yielded five sheng more grain per mu than the land plowed with old plows; this year, the cooperative's more than 5,700 mu of land were not plowed with new plows, and it would yield 280 shi less grain. The cooperative members burned more than 1,000 cartloads of dried manure, but the cooperative lacked a lot of fertilizer. After the detailed calculations, the cooperative members realized that if they did not step up production, there was still a possibility of production reduction this year. The land had already been plowed and there was no way to remedy it, but fertilizer could still be added. Therefore, the cooperative immediately launched a campaign to collect fertilizer. In addition to putting some of the manure that had not yet been burned back into the manure pits to re-compost, they collected more than 1,000 cartloads of fertilizer by sweeping street soil, exchanging kang soil, accumulating plant ash, and emptying chicken coops, and also dredged 600 cartloads of silt from the foul water pits. In this way, in addition to making up for the base fertilizer, there were more than 300 cartloads of human excrement and urine and cattle and horse manure that could be used as top dressing.

　　After production was on track, the cooperative members began to reverse their uneasy emotions. At this time, the work group further educated the cooperative members on the Party's policy of mutual benefit for poor and middle peasants, and helped the committee solve the problems within the cooperative. After discussion and consultation, it was determined that the land remuneration would be increased to 30% of the normal actual output; livestock would be changed to private ownership according to the cooperative members' wishes, and the cooperative would rent them on a long-term or temporary basis; and the fertilizer price would also be appropriately increased. At the same time, the class policy of the Party in rural work was repeatedly explained to the cooperative members, explaining that only when the poor and middle peasants were firmly united could the agricultural cooperative be run well, and criticizing the erroneous thinking of the poor peasants wanting to take advantage of the middle peasants and the middle peasants looking down on the poor peasants. At a cooperative member forum, the poor peasant cooperative members and the middle peasant cooperative members mutually reviewed their past mistakes, further increasing the unity of the poor and middle peasants within the cooperative. After the meeting, some cooperative members said, "With the strengthened unity of the poor and middle peasants, our cooperative will definitely be run well."

　　After this rectification, a new atmosphere emerged in the cooperative. Production was on track, the cooperative members were in high spirits, and the cooperative members who had originally planned to go to the city to "earn cash" also decided not to go.

### 官堡农业合作社加强了贫农中农的团结

　　官堡农业合作社加强了贫农中农的团结
　　李化民
    山西省大仁县官堡农业生产合作社在一九五三年以前，曾经做出一些成绩，受到了上级的表扬。社务委员们没有把这作为鼓励自己把社办得更好的力量，反而背上了骄傲自满的包袱。一九五四年，全社五千七百多亩土地比常年减产百分之三十六。县委派工作组去帮助社务委员会找出了减产的原因，“人民日报”在今年三月二十八日发表了关于这个社减产的教训的通讯。可是，当时县委并没有切实帮助这个社改进工作；社务委员们并没有真正从中得到有益的教训，反而埋怨上级，对批评不服气。有的说：“看见报纸上登了，头上直冒火。”有的说：“要是张顺（原来的驻社工作人员）还在这里，也许不会登报、挨批评哩！”有的认为过去是张顺叫那样干的，不由自己作主；有的认为受了批评脸上不光彩。因此，产生了松劲思想。
    在今年播种以前，大仁县委对这个社并没有加强领导。这个社的春耕还不如一九五四年。一九五四年全社用十八张新式步犁耕地，今年春耕用的却是旧式农具和旧的耕作方法。社内骨干分子盲目地
  “和陈家庄农业合作社比高低”的情绪仍然没有改变，他们不顾条件地把生产资料的报酬压得过低。土地分红是按常年实产量的百分之二十四定的死租，社员除了缴农业税外，从土地上就得不到多少报酬了。牲口入社的价格也比市价低。肥料作价原来就比市价低百分之二十，因为去年社内减产，今年又降低百分之四十；因此，社员都不愿积肥，厕所满了也不掏，把牛、马、羊粪晒干当柴烧而不往社里投。另外，还规定耕畜、车辆、农具一律要作价入社。社员的牲口如果不作价入社，社里就不给草料，既不准出卖又不准出借，有牲口的社员只好勉强把牲口作价归社。这一切措施，都使得中农社员对社不满意，中农社员和贫农社员的关系搞得很坏。中农社员看不起贫农社员。贫农社员看见中农社员不愿把牲口入社，就认为他们“太落后”。地主、富农则乘机进行挑拨，到处破坏社和社主任的威信。大多数社员看到这样情形，都在耽心社能不能办好，今年能不能增产。有的社员在打主意：如果今年再不增产就退社。有二十多户社员打算现在就去城里做工“抓现钱”。
    在播种要开始的时候，县委又派了一个工作组到官堡村去帮助这个社进行整顿。他们先分别和党员、团员、社务委员及全体社员总结了以前办社的成绩，使社内骨干分子看到过去的成绩，提高信心，使社员认识清楚入社还是比单干强。接着，又组织大家讨论“党领导农民走合作化道路的目的”，并对照社里的情况作了检查。经过讨论，大家进一步明确地认识了办社的目的是要大家共同富裕；办好农业合作社的主要标准之一是增加生产、增加社员收入；办好农业合作社的最根本的条件是贫农中农密切团结。可是，去年社里减产了，今年不但生产上没改进，互利原则也没掌握好。如果像这样办下去，社就要散伙，大家就不能过更加富裕的生活了。社主任李富和其他一些社务委员在认识明确以后，都自觉地批判了自己不接受批评的错误，决心要克服骄傲情绪和松劲思想，把社办好。
    在觉悟提高的基础上，工作组帮助他们，从生产着手进行整顿，先研究了搞好生产的办法。工作组同全体社员算了细账：官堡村一九五三年用新犁耕的地，每亩比旧犁耕的多收五升粮食；今年全社五千七百多亩地没用新犁耕，就要少收二百八十石粮食。社员把一千多车粪晒干烧了火，社里却缺少很多肥料。算过细账以后，社员们知道了：若是再不加劲生产，今年还有减产的可能。这时地已犁过，没法补救；但肥料还来得及补上。于是，全社立即开展了搜集肥料的运动。除了把一部分还没烧掉的粪干放在粪坑里重沤外，用扫街土、换炕土、积草木灰、掏鸡窝等办法，搜集了一千多车肥料，还在臭水坑里掏出六百多车淤泥。这样，除去补足了底肥，还有三百多车人粪尿和牛马粪可作追肥之用。
    生产有了头绪以后，社员们开始扭转了不安的情绪。这时工作组便进一步向社员进行了贫农中农互利政策的教育，帮助社务委员会解决社内的问题。经过讨论协商后确定：土地报酬提高到占常年实产量的百分之三十；牲畜根据社员自愿，改为私有，由社里长期租用或临时租用；肥料价格也适当地提高了一些。同时，又反复向社员讲解了党在农村工作中的阶级政策，说明只有贫农和中农巩固地团结起来，农业合作社才能办好，批判了贫农想占中农便宜、中农看不起贫农的错误思想。在一次社员座谈会上，贫农社员和中农社员相互检讨了过去的错误，更增进了社内贫农中农的团结。会后，有的社员说：“贫农中农加强团结，我们的社一定能办好。”
    经过这番整顿以后，社里出现了新气象。生产上了轨道，社员情绪很高，原来准备进城“抓现钱”的社员也决定不去了。
