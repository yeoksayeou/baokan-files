According to a report by the German News Agency, people from all walks of life in East and West Germany have sent numerous letters requesting that the Geneva Four Powers Summit allow an all-German delegation to participate in the meeting and present the opinions of the German people.

    The mayor of Ofrat, German Democratic Republic, has written to the heads of government of the four powers, representing the peace-loving citizens of the city, requesting permission to send an all-German delegation to participate in the Geneva Conference on the German question.

    Members of the Jena City Council of the German Democratic Republic suggested that the Geneva Four Powers Summit discuss issues such as preparing a peace treaty with Germany, withdrawing occupying forces, and abolishing all military bases on German territory. They also suggested that the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the West German Federal Assembly take measures to jointly represent the views of Germany at the Geneva Conference.

    Recently, a conference on the issue of all-German negotiations was held at the "Otto Grotewohl" Joint Factory in Böhlen (near Leipzig). One hundred and fifty representatives of miners from East and West Germany participated in the meeting. They demanded that the voices of representatives from both parts of Germany be heard at the upcoming Geneva Conference.
