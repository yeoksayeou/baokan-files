    Redouble Our Efforts to Build Our Great Motherland
    The First National People's Congress, Second Session, bearing a significant historical mission, has victoriously concluded. The meeting unanimously adopted the First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy to create a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, adopted the state budget to ensure the realization of the 1955 construction plan, adopted the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," which is of extreme importance to our national defense, and adopted the resolution on the "Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River's Water Damage and Developing the Yellow River's Water Resources," which realizes the dreams of the Chinese people for thousands of years. The meeting also adopted the resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, adopted the review opinions of the proposals of the Second Session of the National People's Congress, adopted the resolution on authorizing the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to formulate separate regulations, adopted the resolution on abolishing Rehe Province and Xikang Province and amending Article 25, Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the "Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels of the People's Republic of China," and adopted the resolution on abolishing the Ministry of Fuel Industry and establishing the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, and amending Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the "Organic Law of the State Council of the People's Republic of China."
    The meeting demonstrated a high degree of consensus in discussing and deciding on major issues, such as the issue of developing industry, especially heavy industry, as the center of economic construction, the major reform of the military system of replacing voluntary military service with compulsory military service, and other important issues. This high degree of consensus reflects the high degree of unity of our 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party, and reflects the unwavering common will and desire of our 600 million people to build and defend their great motherland. This high degree of consensus guarantees that our country can overcome all difficulties and obstacles on the road forward and victoriously realize our unprecedentedly great construction plan. As long as this high degree of unity continues to be maintained and continuously strengthened, we will certainly be able to complete the extremely glorious and great socialist cause we have already begun.
    The First Five-Year Plan for our country's national economic development, which was discussed and adopted at the meeting, is a summary of our country's achievements and experience in economic construction over the past few years, and it is also a concrete plan and step for our people to advance victoriously along the socialist road. Implementing such large-scale planned construction involves many extremely complex problems. These complex problems have been resolved one by one at the meeting, which shows that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are not only capable of overthrowing the reactionary rule of domestic and foreign enemies, but also capable of building their own great motherland and happy life, so that our country's economic development level can catch up with and surpass any capitalist country.
    However, it should not be forgotten that there are still many difficulties on our road forward. The poverty caused by the long-term reactionary rule has left us without abundant construction funds, which is one of the difficulties. In order to overcome this difficulty, we must strengthen the accumulation of funds in production and implement a comprehensive and strict system of economy throughout the country. In the past few years, our country has had a lot of waste in productive and non-productive construction, in the production and operation of industrial, transportation, and commercial departments, and in the administrative management expenses of state organs. This is partly because we lack the necessary experience and knowledge, and partly because the leading comrades of many of our enterprises and organs have some erroneous ideas, such as the idea of ​​rebuilding everything in construction, the so-called "generous budget and tight spending" idea in the budget, the idea that "waste is inevitable due to lack of experience," and the idea that "since we want to build modern industrial enterprises, other non-productive construction and welfare facilities must also be modernized," and so on. These erroneous ideas have caused many serious wastes in the past; if they are not resolutely corrected, they will continue to cause major wastes in the future. In all cadres and the masses, we should actively advocate the style of diligence, simplicity, and hard work, and oppose the bad habits of only caring about the present and not the future, and blindly pursuing luxury and extravagance. We must turn comprehensive economy into a conscious movement of the whole people, not only not wasting ourselves, but also supervising the entire organs and enterprises, and opposing any waste by anyone. The current movement to save food is closely related to our construction cause and people's lives. All organs, enterprises, schools, troops, and groups must vigorously carry out this movement in a planned way, and promote the active participation of the entire people.
    Implementing large-scale planned economic construction is a new subject for the people of our country and state workers, and we lack knowledge and experience in this area. In order to overcome the difficulties in this regard, we must organize the broad masses of state organ workers and enterprise cadres to work hard to learn the scientific knowledge needed to build the motherland, so that we can quickly accept and master all the latest scientific achievements and use them to serve economic construction. The view that doing leadership work only requires understanding politics and does not require understanding technology, as well as the view of belittling science and technology, is very wrong and very harmful. It was excusable if leaders did not have the necessary scientific knowledge of the business they managed in the past, but in the future, it will inevitably become increasingly incompetent, causing more and more mistakes, causing waste of funds and loss of time, making it impossible for us to catch up with the advanced level of foreign countries in a timely manner, and bad elements will take advantage of this weakness to attack us. Therefore, we must put down our airs, study diligently and hard, and study humbly and cautiously. We must learn the scientific knowledge and construction experience of the Soviet Union and other advanced countries, as well as the scientific knowledge and experience in various aspects that our country already has; learn from scientists and experts, and also learn from experienced workers and masses. Facts have proved that anyone who is determined to study hard in this way is fully capable of learning various necessary knowledge and technologies in a relatively short period of time, and becoming an expert and specialist in the work he undertakes.
    When our entire people are working together to build our great motherland, hidden counter-revolutionary elements, under the command of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, are using despicable and insidious methods to sabotage our cause in all aspects. We must resolutely criticize and correct the erroneous tendency of only focusing on construction, not asking about politics, turning a blind eye to the sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and being indifferent. We should not only do our business well and do our construction well, but also take measures to protect the fruits of our construction. If anyone thinks that his responsibility is only to do his business well, and that the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements is only the responsibility of public security and judicial organs, then he has not fulfilled half of his responsibility. Therefore, the current movement to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements must become a movement of all cadres and all the people. Victory on this front is an important guarantee for our victory on the construction front. To this end, we must deeply and continuously criticize the right-leaning emotions of complacency, inattention to preventing spies and counter-revolutionaries, disbelief that there are hidden counter-revolutionary elements, or disbelief that counter-revolutionary elements dare to carry out sabotage boldly among the broad masses of cadres and the people.
    At the Second Session of the National People's Congress, Premier Zhou Enlai explained in detail to the representatives the international situation and our country's foreign policy. Premier Zhou pointed out the achievements of the four-government heads summit, analyzed several pressing issues in the Far East situation and our country's position on these issues, and made important remarks on the relationship between China and the United States in particular. The people of our country love peace. Our construction needs a peaceful environment. Precisely because of this, the people of our country hope that the Geneva Agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina can be strictly observed, that the peaceful reunification of Korea can be realized, and that the relations between China and Japan can be normalized. The people of our country are especially concerned about eliminating the tensions in the Taiwan region of our country caused by the United States, and hope that this issue and some other disputed issues between China and the United States can be gradually resolved through negotiations between China and the United States. The ambassadorial talks between China and the United States to be held tomorrow should prepare for higher-level talks between the two countries.
    The achievements of the Second Session of the National People's Congress are significant, and the gains are multifaceted. The First Five-Year Plan, which is the focus of this meeting, is a program of decisive significance for realizing our country's general task during the transition period. The full realization of this plan will lay a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist construction cause. All people who hope that our country will be prosperous and strong should unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and strive from all aspects to realize this great plan.

    加倍努力建设我们伟大的祖国
    担负着重大历史使命的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议胜利闭幕了。会议一致通过了为我国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业创建初步基础的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，通过了保证一九五五年度建设计划实现的国家预算，通过了对我国国防事业具有极重大意义的“中华人民共和国兵役法”，通过了实现我国人民几千年梦想的“根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划”的决议。会议还通过了关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告的决议，通过了全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案审查意见，通过了关于授权全国人民代表大会常务委员会制定单行法规的决议，通过了关于撤销热河省、西康省并修改中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法第二十五条第二款第一项规定的决议，通过了关于撤销燃料工业部设立煤炭工业部、电力工业部、石油工业部、农产品采购部并修改中华人民共和国国务院组织法第二条第一款条文的决议。
    会议在讨论和决定各项重大问题，比如以发展工业尤其是发展重工业作为经济建设中心的问题，以义务兵役制代替志愿兵制的军事制度重大改革的问题，以及其他重要问题上，都表现出高度的一致性。这种高度的一致性，反映了我国六万万人民在中国工人阶级和中国共产党领导下的高度团结，反映了我国六万万人民对于建设和保卫自己伟大祖国的不可动摇的共同意志和愿望。这种高度的一致性，保证我们国家能够战胜前进道路上的一切困难和险阻，胜利地实现我们空前伟大的建设计划。只要这种高度的团结一致性继续保持下去，并且不断地加强，我们就一定能够完成我们所已经开始了的极其光荣而伟大的社会主义事业。
    会议所讨论和通过了的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是我国几年来进行经济建设的成绩和经验的总结，同时也是我国人民沿着社会主义道路胜利前进的具体计划和步骤。实行这样大规模的有计划的建设，包含着许多极其复杂的问题。这些复杂问题在会议中逐一得到解决，这就说明我国人民在中国共产党领导之下，不仅有能力推翻国内外敌人的反动统治，而且有能力建设自己伟大的祖国和幸福的生活，使我国的经济发展程度赶上并且超过任何资本主义国家。
    但是不应该忘记，在我们前进的道路上，还是有许多困难的。过去长时期反动统治所造成的贫困状态，使我们没有富裕的建设资金，这就是困难之一。为了克服这一困难，我们就必须加强生产中的资金积累，并在全国范围内实行全面的严格的节约制度。过去几年来，我们国家在生产性的建设和非生产性的建设方面，在工业部门、交通运输部门、商业部门的生产和营业方面，在国家机关的行政管理费用方面，都有很多的浪费。这一方面是因为我们缺乏必要的经验和知识，一方面也是由于我们有许多企业和机关的领导同志们有一些错误的思想，诸如在建设上的百废俱兴思想，预算上的所谓“宽打窄用”思想，“经验不足，浪费不可避免”的思想，以及认为“既要建设现代化的工业企业，则其他非生产性的建设和福利设施也必须现代化”的思想，等等。这些错误的思想，过去已经造成许多严重的浪费；如不坚决纠正，今后仍然会继续造成重大的浪费。在所有的干部和群众中，应该积极提倡勤劳朴素和艰苦奋斗的作风，反对只顾眼前不顾将来、盲目追求豪华阔绰的恶劣习气。我们要把全面节约变成全民的自觉运动，不仅自己不浪费，还要监督整个的机关和企业，反对任何人的任何浪费。目前正在进行的节约粮食的运动，对于我们的建设事业和人民生活有十分密切的关系，一切的机关、企业、学校、部队和团体，都必须有计划地大力进行，并且推动全体人民群众积极参加。
    实行大规模的有计划的经济建设，这对于我国人民和国家工作人员是新的课题，我们缺乏这方面的知识和经验。为了克服从这方面来的困难，我们就必须组织广大的国家机关工作人员和企业干部，努力学习建设祖国所需要的科学知识，使我们能够迅速地接受并掌握一切最新的科学成就，用来为经济建设服务。那种认为做领导工作只需要懂得政治、不需要懂得技术的观点，以及轻视科学和技术的观点，是十分错误十分有害的。领导者对于自己所管理的业务没有必要的科学知识，如果在过去还是可以原谅的，那末在今后就必然愈来愈要显得不能称职，愈来愈要造成更多的错误，造成资金的浪费和时间的损失，使我们不能及时地赶上外国的先进水平，而坏分子也就会利用这种弱点向我们进攻。因此我们必须放下架子，勤劳刻苦地学习，谦虚谨慎地学习，学习苏联和其他先进国家的科学知识和建设经验，也学习我国已有的科学知识和各方面的经验；向科学家和专门家学习，也向有经验的职工群众学习。事实已经证明，谁只要有决心这样刻苦努力地学习，谁就完全有可能在较短的期间内学得各种必要的知识和技术，变成自己所担负的工作中的内行和专门家。
    当我们全国人民同心戮力来建设自己伟大祖国的时候，暗藏的反革命分子正在帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的指挥下，采用卑鄙阴险的方法来对我们的事业进行各方面的破坏。我们必须坚决批判并纠正那种只管埋头建设、不问政治、对暗藏的反革命分子的破坏熟视无睹、漠不关心的错误倾向。我们不仅应该把业务搞好，把建设搞好，同时也必须采取措施保护自己建设的成果。谁如果以为自己的责任只是搞好业务，而肃清反革命分子的斗争则只是公安和司法机关的责任，那他就有一半的责任没有尽到。因此，目前正在开展着的肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的运动，必须成为全体干部和全体人民群众的运动。这条战线上的胜利是我们在建设战线上取得胜利的重要保证。为此，我们必须在广大干部和群众中深入地不断地批判那种麻痹大意、不注意防奸反特、不相信有暗藏的反革命分子或不相信反革命分子敢于大胆进行破坏的右倾情绪。
    在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，周恩来总理向代表们详细地说明了国际形势和我国的外交政策。周总理指出了四国政府首脑会议的成就，分析了远东局势中的几个迫切问题以及我国对这些问题的立场，并且特别对中美两国间的关系作了重要的论述。我国人民热爱和平。我们的建设需要和平的环境。正因为这样，我国人民希望关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议能够受到严格的遵守，朝鲜的和平统一能够实现，中国和日本的关系能够正常化。我国人民尤其关心消除美国所造成的我国台湾地区的紧张局势，并且希望这一问题和中美两国间的一些其他争执问题能够通过中美之间的谈判逐步求得解决。明天即将举行的中美两国大使级会谈应当为两国间更高级的会谈作准备工作。
    全国人民代表大会第二次会议的成就是重大的，收获是多方面的。作为这次会议的中心的第一个五年计划是实现我国过渡时期总任务的带有决定意义的纲领。这一计划的全部实现，将为我国的社会主义建设事业奠定初步的基础。一切希望我们国家繁荣富强的人们，应当更加团结一致地在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，从一切方面来为实现这一伟大的计划而奋斗。
