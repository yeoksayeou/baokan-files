　　Nepal and Sikkim Governments Take Measures
　　Restricting Activities of Foreigners in Areas Adjacent to China

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 2nd - The suspicious activities of British Royal Air Force and other foreign expeditions on the border of Nepal and Sikkim, adjacent to the Tibet region of China, have drawn the attention of the Nepalese and Sikkimese governments.

The Indian Urdu daily "Glory" reported on the 1st that recently, British Royal Air Force pilots have ostensibly been busy conquering peaks on the India-Nepal border. However, after the Nepalese government learned the true nature of their activities, it felt it necessary to restrict them. The report stated that the Nepalese government stipulated that foreign mountaineering expeditions must be accompanied by Nepalese officials. On June 30th, the Nepalese government accused a foreign expedition of conducting activities outside the area designated by the government without authorization.

The newspaper said that the Sikkim government has also announced regulations imposing strict restrictions on the activities of foreigners. For some time, foreigners, mostly missionaries, have been engaged in suspiciously-shaped activities on the Sikkim border adjacent to China.

　　尼泊尔和锡金政府采取措施
　　限制外国人在同中国毗邻地区活动
    新华社新德里二日讯　英国皇家空军和其他外国人的探险队在尼泊尔、锡金两国毗邻中国西藏地区的边境上的可疑活动已经引起尼泊尔政府和锡金政府的注意。
    印度的乌尔都文日报“荣耀报”一日的消息说，最近，英国皇家空军的驾驶员表面上一直在忙于征服印度—尼泊尔边境上的高峰，但是当尼泊尔政府在得知他们的活动的真实情况后，觉得有必要对他们的活动加以限制。消息说，尼泊尔政府规定外国爬山探险队必须有尼泊尔官员伴随。尼泊尔政府在六月三十日曾指责一个外国探险队擅自到政府所指定的地区以外进行活动。
    这家报纸说，锡金政府也已经宣布了予外国人的活动以严格限制的规定。若干时候以来，就一直有外国人在毗邻中国的锡金边境上从事形迹可疑的活动，其中大部分是传教士。
