Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th. "Pravda" published an editorial on the closing of the Four-Power Summit on the 23rd, titled "Striving to Consolidate Universal Peace."

The editorial said: This meeting will be recorded in history as the beginning of a new stage in the relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. This meeting will help strengthen trust between these four countries and their peoples, and will also have a positive significance for other countries and for promoting universal peace. The personal contact between the leaders of the major powers played an important role.

The editorial said: The meeting showed that it is entirely possible to carry out international cooperation that is beneficial to peace. Establishing international trust is a realistic and achievable goal. The characteristic of the post-war period is the intensification of international tension, and the Geneva Conference shows that there is a realistic path to avoiding the "Cold War." There is a realistic path to resolving international disputes.

The editorial said that the Geneva Conference had positive results, and some important decisions had already been taken. The exchange of views on the issue of European security showed that the participating countries expressed their willingness to find a mutually agreed solution to this major issue. On the issue of disarmament, the attitudes of the four countries either completely coincided or were very close. The participating countries adopted different attitudes towards the German question. The only practical way to unify Germany is to establish a European collective security system in which the two parts of Germany participate on an equal footing before German unification. The decision of the four heads of government on the need to develop contacts between East and West is also of great significance.

The editorial said that the Soviet delegation regretted that the Geneva Conference did not pay due attention to the issues of Asia and the Far East, which must be resolved.

The editorial concluded that the Soviet people welcomed the news of the conclusion of the Geneva Conference with approval. They believe that the Geneva Conference has opened the way for further discussion and resolution of urgent international issues. In the course of the Geneva Conference, the will of all countries to strive for peace was also clearly demonstrated. As long as countries continue to show the spirit of cooperation shown in Geneva in the future, then this is a reliable guarantee that the lofty goal of maintaining peace will be achieved, so that the people of all countries can feel at ease about their tomorrow.

    “真理报”评论四国政府首脑会议闭幕
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：“真理报”就二十三日闭幕的四国政府首脑会议发表社论，题目是“争取巩固普遍的和平”。
    社论说：这次会议将被作为苏、美、英、法四国关系的一个新阶段的开端而载入史册。这次会议将有助于加强这四个国家和它们的人民之间的信任，而对其他国家、对增进普遍的和平也将有积极的意义。大国领袖的个人接触，起了重要的作用。
    社论说：会议表明，在现在实行有利于和平的国际合作是完全可能的。建立国际间的信任是现实的、可以达到的目标。战后时期历史的特征是国际紧张局势的加剧，而日内瓦会议表明，避免“冷战”的现实道路是存在的。解决国际纠纷问题的现实道路是存在的。
    社论说，日内瓦会议有了积极的成果，并且已经采取了一些重要的决定。会议就欧洲安全的问题交换意见的结果表明，与会各国都表示愿意对这个重大的问题找到一致同意的解决办法。在裁军问题上，四国的态度或者完全符合，或者大大接近了。与会各国对德国问题采取了不同的态度，统一德国唯一切实可行的道路是建立在德国统一以前由德国两部分在平等基础上参加的欧洲集体安全体系。四国政府首脑关于必须发展东西方之间的接触的决定也是有重大意义的。
    社论说，苏联代表团认为遗憾的是，日内瓦会议没有对亚洲和远东问题予以应有的注意，这些问题是必须解决的。
    社论最后说，苏联人民怀着赞同的心情欢迎日内瓦会议结束的消息。他们相信，日内瓦会议已为进一步讨论和解决迫切的国际问题打开了道路。在日内瓦会议的过程中，也明显地表现了各国争取和平的意志。只要各国将来仍然表现出在日内瓦表现的那种合作精神，那末，这就是一个可靠的保证，保证维持和平的崇高目的得以达到，使各国人民对自己的明天感到放心。
