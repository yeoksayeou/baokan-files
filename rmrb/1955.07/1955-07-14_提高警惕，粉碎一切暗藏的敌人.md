    Heighten Vigilance, Crush All Hidden Enemies
    Cai Tingkai
    The recent exposure in the "People's Daily" and many national newspapers of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes is another tremendous victory in our country's struggle against domestic and foreign enemies during the transition period. All facts irrefutably prove that Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique are not only our ideological enemies but also our political enemies. They were a black gang with close ties to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, engaging in counter-revolutionary criminal activities within our revolutionary ranks from a very early stage.
    From the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, I deeply realize that as our country's socialist construction cause develops victoriously and the people's democratic dictatorship grows stronger day by day, domestic and foreign class enemies, seeing the arrival of their doom, will never slumber or fail to resist. On the contrary, they will adopt more covert and insidious methods to carry out their dying struggles, attempting to cause the failure of the Chinese revolution and restore reactionary rule in China. Clearly, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is precisely such a group launching an attack on the people. Therefore, we must learn from this incident, heighten revolutionary vigilance, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, follow the laws of class struggle, eliminate all complacency and pacifist ideas, resolutely stand on the battle line of this sharp struggle against the enemy, and fight to the end to resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionaries.
    From the materials published in the "People's Daily," we see that the main targets of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's "striving for" and "liaison" were those liberalists, or those who had problems in their history, or those who had made mistakes and were unwilling to correct them, as well as all those who proceeded from individualism, were dissatisfied with revolutionary organizations, and had complacent emotions. This is worthy of our comrades' attention. After the nationwide liberation, many of our comrades successively participated in revolutionary work and undoubtedly received a certain amount of revolutionary training through study and various political movements. However, due to our class origin and social experience, we still have considerable liberalistic and individualistic thoughts. We should learn from the Hu Feng incident, and through the study of relevant documents, further examine our shortcomings, strengthen theoretical study, improve our political sense, and strengthen self-education and self-transformation. In this way, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we can smash the enemy's conspiracies and ensure the victorious completion of the socialist construction cause.

    提高警惕，粉碎一切暗藏的敌人
    蔡廷锴
    最近“人民日报”和全国许多报刊对于胡风反革命集团反党、反人民、反革命罪行的揭露，是我国在过渡时期反对国内外敌人斗争中的又一次巨大的胜利。一切事实都无可辩驳地证明了：胡风及其反革命集团不仅是我们思想上的敌人，而且是我们政治上的敌人，他们很早就是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系而混在我们革命阵营里来进行反革命罪恶活动的黑帮。
    从胡风反革命集团事件的被揭露，我深深认识到：当我们国家的社会主义建设事业胜利发展和人民民主专政日益强大的时候，国内外阶级敌人眼看到自己末日的到来，决不会酣睡，没有反抗；相反，他们一定要采取更加隐蔽、更加险恶的方式来进行他们垂死的挣扎，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。很显然，胡风反革命集团正是这样一个向人民进攻的集团。因此，我们必须从这个事件吸取教训，提高革命警惕，紧紧团结在中国共产党的周围，遵照阶级斗争的规律，肃清一切麻痹思想和太平观念，坚决地站到这个尖锐的对敌斗争的战线上来，为坚决肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子而斗争到底。
    从“人民日报”所发表的材料中，我们看出了胡风反革命集团“争取”“联络”的主要对象，就是那些自由主义分子，或者历史上有问题，或曾经犯过错误而不愿意改正的，以及一切从个人主义出发，对革命组织不满，和有骄傲自满情绪的一些人。这就很值得我们同志们的注意。在全国解放后，我们许多同志，先后参加了革命工作，并通过学习和各种政治运动，无疑都受到了一定的革命锻炼，但是由于我们的阶级出身和社会经历关系，我们仍然是有相当浓厚的自由主义和个人主义思想的。我们应该从胡风事件吸取教训，通过有关文件的学习，进一步来检查自己的缺点，加强理论学习，提高政治嗅觉，加强自我教育和自我改造。这样，我们才能在中国共产党领导下，粉碎敌人的阴谋活动，保证社会主义建设事业胜利完成。
