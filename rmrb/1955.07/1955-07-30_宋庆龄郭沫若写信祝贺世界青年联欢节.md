Youth and students are the masters of the future world, and the further the friendship between youth and students is promoted, the more solid the guarantee of world peace becomes. Those who lead the future world are close friends like brothers, and the advocacy of power politics and the intimidation of atomic war should disappear without a trace. Raise the banner of peace high, and all good people around the world are cheering for you.
