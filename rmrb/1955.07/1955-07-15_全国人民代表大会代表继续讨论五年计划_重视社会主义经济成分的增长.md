Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—The deputies to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued their discussion of the draft First Five-Year Plan in various group meetings today.

    As of today, all the deputy groups have finished reading the last two parts of the draft First Five-Year Plan—the issues of local plans, and practicing thrift and opposing waste. The explanations given by responsible staff members dispatched by the State Council of the People's Republic of China to the labor models, combat heroes, and representatives of minority nationalities in the various deputy groups have also concluded.

    In group discussions, the deputies attached great importance and expressed extreme excitement regarding the gradual increase in the proportion of socialist economic components and their increasingly strengthened leading position in the national economy. The deputies believed that only on the material basis of developing socialist large-scale industry can the original face of our national economy be transformed. It is necessary to continuously and gradually increase the proportion of socialist industry in the entire industry, concentrating efforts on developing industries that produce the means of production to ensure that our industrialization advances along the socialist path.

    Some deputy groups focused on discussing the issue of increased agricultural production. The deputies believed that the draft Five-Year Plan correctly points out that developing agriculture is a basic condition for guaranteeing the development of industry and the completion of all economic plans. The deputies pointed out that efforts must be made to overcome the current backward state of agricultural production in our country. The current production potential in rural areas has not been fully realized, and farmers have many experiences in increasing production that should be summarized and promoted. At the same time, advanced technologies and new agricultural implements should also be promoted to farmers. The deputies all believed that the great plan for agricultural cooperation stipulated in the draft Five-Year Plan is the main method for improving agricultural production and a necessary step for guiding farmers towards socialism.

    Many deputies used examples of the growth rate of people's purchasing power exceeding the growth rate of consumer goods production to illustrate that the state's implementation of a policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton cloth, and cooking oil, with state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives systematically controlling sources of goods and organizing supplies, and severely cracking down on speculators, to ensure market stability, is entirely in the interests of the people.

    In their speeches, the deputies also emphasized the issue of carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Some deputies pointed out that private industrialists and businessmen must obey state plans, obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, and actively create conditions to transform into state capitalism, and ultimately transform into a socialist economy.

    The deputies also believed in their speeches that, in the past, our country's scientific foundation was very weak. In order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, scientific research work should be greatly strengthened. Many people from the cultural and scientific circles among the deputies expressed at the meeting that they bear a great responsibility.

    This afternoon, the Credentials Committee of the First National People's Congress held a meeting. The meeting reviewed the qualifications of the three deputies newly elected from Sichuan Province, Xi'an City, and Hunan Province to fill vacancies caused by the deaths of the original deputies.

    全国人民代表大会代表继续讨论五年计划
    重视社会主义经济成分的增长
    新华社十四日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议各代表小组今天继续讨论第一个五年计划草案。
    到今天为止，所有代表小组都已阅读完第一个五年计划草案的最后两部分——地方计划问题以及厉行节约和反对浪费的问题。中华人民共和国国务院派出的负责工作人员为各代表小组中的劳动模范、战斗英雄、少数民族代表等进行的解释工作也已结束。
    在分组讨论中，代表们非常重视和极为兴奋地谈到社会主义经济成分比重的逐步增长和它在国民经济中领导地位的日益加强。代表们认为，只有在发展社会主义大工业的物质基础上，才能改造我国国民经济的原来面貌。必须不断地逐步地增加社会主义性质的工业在整个工业中的比重，集中力量发展制造生产资料的工业，以保证我国的工业化遵循着社会主义的道路前进。
    有的代表小组着重地讨论了农业增产问题。代表们认为，五年计划草案中指出发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件，这完全是正确的。代表们指出，必须努力克服目前我国农业生产的落后状况，目前农村中的生产潜力还没有充分发挥，农民有很多增产经验应加以总结和推广。同时，还应向农民推广先进技术和新式农具。代表们都认为五年计划草案中规定的农业合作化的伟大计划，是提高农业生产的主要办法，也是引导农民走向社会主义的必要步骤。
    许多代表用人民购买力增长的速度超过消费品生产增长的速度的实例，说明国家对粮食、棉布和食油等实行统购统销政策，国营商业部门和供销合作社有计划掌握货源和组织供应，严厉打击投机者，保证市场稳定，是完全符合人民利益的。
    代表们在发言中还强调了对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的问题。有些代表指出，私营工商业者必须服从国家计划，服从国营经济的领导，积极创造条件，以便转变为国家资本主义，并在最后转变为社会主义经济。
    代表们发言时还认为，过去我国科学基础十分薄弱，为适应大规模经济建设的需要，应大力加强科学研究工作。代表中许多文化科学界人士在会上都表示自己负有重大的责任。
    今天下午，第一届全国人民代表大会代表资格审查委员会举行了会议。会议审查了四川省、西安市、湖南省因原有代表逝世而补选的三位代表的资格。
