    Differentiate Between Different Situations and Implement the Basic Construction Savings Policy

    To realize the various measures for practicing thrift proposed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council in basic construction, we must differentiate between different situations and adopt different steps and methods. Only in this way can we save a large amount of funds on the one hand, and on the other hand, avoid affecting the progress and quality of basic construction projects, and avoid generating new waste.

    The situation of basic construction is very different. There are productive construction and non-productive construction; there are permanent projects and temporary projects; there are projects that have already started and projects that have not yet started. Some are in the warm south, some are in the cold north; some are in isolated mining areas with more land and less construction, and some are in new industrial areas or central areas of large cities with less land and more construction. Different saving methods should be adopted for these different situations. Anyone who ignores this point and engages in simplistic work will commit a subjective error, and will not only fail to achieve savings but will also generate various new deviations.

    In particular, the implementation of the basic construction plan in the first half of this year was not very good, and most of the workload needs to be completed in the second half of the year. Now is also the important season for construction, some projects have already started, some have prepared for construction, and some have completed the design. Seizing the time to start construction quickly and ensuring the quality to complete the revised schedule is an urgent task of basic construction. Under these circumstances, if construction is stopped uniformly to wait for design modifications, it will cause great losses. If productive construction projects are stopped, the original schedule cannot be guaranteed, which will affect the industrial construction plan; if non-productive construction projects are stopped, it may also cause idling and material stockpiling and other new waste. Therefore, when implementing the policy of practicing thrift in basic construction in the second half of this year, we must not only consider different construction natures and different conditions in different construction areas, but also make specific arrangements based on whether the design has been completed, whether construction preparations have been made, and whether construction has already started.

    How should we implement the policy of practicing thrift in basic construction in the second half of this year? In terms of productive construction, we should distinguish between two different situations and adopt two different measures. One is for projects that have completed the design, have made construction preparations, or are already under construction. These projects should mainly strive for savings by improving construction methods, improving construction organization, reducing material waste, and saving management costs; design modifications should be made appropriately where possible without hindering project progress or reducing project quality. The other is for projects that are starting design or are in the process of designing. For these projects, where appropriate design modifications are needed in accordance with the new spirit of the central instructions, time should be seized to quickly modify and approve them, striving not to delay the original construction schedule. In terms of non-productive construction, we should also distinguish between two different situations and adopt two different measures. One is for projects that have completed the design but have not yet made construction preparations. These projects should resolutely implement the spirit of the central instructions, and quickly modify the design according to the established reduction targets before construction. The other is for projects that have made construction preparations or are already under construction. In addition to saving investment through improving construction organization, improving construction methods, reducing material waste, and saving management costs, these projects should be jointly discussed by construction, design, and construction parties to cancel certain unnecessary houses, equipment, and architectural decorations in order to achieve the purpose of saving. The design modification issues of these civil buildings should be decided based on different situations such as whether they are urgently needed, whether construction has started, whether construction preparations have been made, whether materials have been prepared, whether the allocated materials can be transferred for other uses, and whether it is reasonable to do so. Those that can be modified should be modified, and those that cannot be modified can continue to be constructed without modification, in order to avoid or reduce idling and material stockpiling as much as possible. When modifying designs and lowering standards, it is also necessary to ensure the applicability and quality of the houses, and avoid causing long-term irrational phenomena or greater waste.

    Currently, various basic construction departments have formulated plans to save investment. Many grassroots units have also actively and proactively adopted saving measures and achieved great results. However, there are also individual units that have not well considered the different conditions, locations, and times of each project, and have adopted savings measures that are not in line with reality, thus generating some deviations. If these deviations are not corrected in time, they will cause new waste and even bring huge losses to future construction and production work. This must be prevented.

    Some units simply adopt savings measures without considering the specific circumstances of construction preparation and construction progress, resulting in new waste. In the Lanzhou area, some construction units originally decided that most of the non-productive houses would be two- to three-story buildings. The design units had already carried out the design, and the construction units had prepared the materials and allocated the construction forces. However, the departments in charge of these construction units did not consider the specific local conditions and decided that all of them should be changed to bungalows, which caused material stockpiling and idling. Lanzhou's terrain faces the Yellow River and is backed by high mountains, with very little flat land. If all bungalows are built, there simply will not be enough space. The Benxi City Construction Engineering Bureau undertook the construction of three three-story dormitory buildings, which had already started in early May. Now the heating trenches have been completed, and the heating materials have long been stored, but the heating equipment has been completely cut off. Not only were the heating trenches built in vain, but also materials were stockpiled. Even the louver doors that had been made were not used, and ordinary doors were made instead; even the formwork that had been supported and the steel bars that had been tied were also cut off. All this shows that it is impossible to do things without considering the specific situation.

    There are also some units that only consider the current savings in isolation, while ignoring the different uses and quality requirements of each project. For example, the internal roads of the tractor factory were originally planned to use 300-grade concrete. The First Ministry of Machine Building, in order to "save," decided to use 110-grade concrete, the same as ordinary roads. They did not consider that these roads would be used to drive tractors in the future; fortunately, it was corrected in time, otherwise, the low-grade concrete could not withstand the weight of the tractors and would be crushed, and would have to be rebuilt in the future. This shows that rashly modifying the design without carefully analyzing the specific situation will often hinder the project quality and long-term use after the project is completed, and the harm is great.

    In order to prevent affecting the speed of industrial construction, affecting project quality, and causing new waste, in the process of implementing the central government's savings policy, we must oppose all practices that do not consider specific conditions and do not consider the problem comprehensively. However, it is absolutely not allowed for anyone to use this as an excuse to resist the central government's savings policy or discount the savings issue. It is absolutely not allowed to use "reasons" such as the personnel are all in place, the materials are prepared, or the construction period is tight, and the technical level of the workers is low, etc., not to modify the design that can be modified, and not to save the materials that can be transferred for other uses. The implementation of the central government's savings policy must be firm and thorough; the consideration of specific savings measures must be cautious and realistic. In recent times, the results of practice in many units have proved that under any conditions, strict savings requirements can be achieved. The dormitory project of the tractor factory, because the design personnel went to the site to study with the construction personnel and modify the design on the spot, resulted in saving more than one million yuan of funds in the case of the projects that have started without stopping construction and the projects that have not started starting on schedule, exceeding the standards stipulated by the state. This shows that as long as we bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, it is entirely possible to correctly realize and over-fulfill the central government's requirement to save 15% on the basis of saving 10% of the basic construction investment this year.

### 区别不同情况，贯彻基本建设的节约方针

    区别不同情况，贯彻基本建设的节约方针
    要在基本建设中实现党中央和国务院提出的厉行节约的各项措施，我们就一定要区别不同的情况，采取不同的步骤和不同的办法。只有这样，才能一方面节省出大量的资金，一方面又不致影响基本建设工程的进度和质量，不致产生新的浪费。
    基本建设的情况是很不相同的。有生产性建设和非生产性建设；有永久性工程和临时性工程；有已开工的工程和未开工的工程。它们有的在气候温暖的南方，有的在严寒的北方；有的在土地较多建筑量不大的孤立的矿区，有的在土地不多而建筑量较大的新工业区或大城市的中心区。针对这些不同的情况，就应该采取不同的节约办法。谁要是忽略了这一点，简单从事，谁就会犯主观主义的错误，不但不能取得节约的效果，反而会产生各种各样新的偏差。
    特别是今年上半年基本建设计划执行的情况不很好，大部分工作量需要在下半年去完成；目前又到了施工的重要季节，有的工程已经施工，有的已经作了施工准备，有的已完成了设计。抓紧时间迅速开工，保证质量良好地完成已经修正的进度计划，乃是基本建设的一项迫切任务。在这种情况下，如果一律停止施工，等待修改设计，将会造成很大的损失。生产性的建设工程停下来，就不能保证原来的进度，就会影响工业建设计划；非生产性的建设工程停下来，也可能造成窝工和材料积压等新的浪费。因此，今年下半年在基本建设中贯彻厉行节约的方针时，不仅要根据不同的建设性质，不同建设地区的不同条件，而且要根据是否完成设计，是否作了施工准备，是否已经施工等具体情况来作具体安排。
    今年下半年在基本建设中应该怎样贯彻厉行节约的方针呢？在生产性建设方面应该区别两种不同的情况，采用两种不同的措施。一种是已完成设计、已作施工准备或已在施工的工程。这些工程主要应当通过改进施工方法、改善施工组织、减少材料浪费、节省管理费用等办法来力求节约；在不妨碍工程进度和不降低工程质量的条件下，对设计可能作适当修改的就应作适当修改。另一种是开始设计或正在设计的工程。这些工程根据中央指示的新的精神需要在设计方面作适当修改的，应该抓紧时间，迅速加以修改和审批，争取不耽误原定的施工进度。在非生产性建设方面，也应该区别两种不同情况，采取两种不同的措施。一种是已经完成设计，但还没有作好施工准备的工程。这些工程应该坚决贯彻中央指示的精神，按照已定的削减指标迅速修改设计后再行施工。另一种是已作施工准备或已在施工的工程。这些工程除了通过改善施工组织、改进施工方法、减少材料浪费、节省管理费用等办法节约投资以外，应当由建设、设计和施工各方面商同取消某些不必要的房屋、设备和建筑装饰，以达到节约的目的。这些民用建筑的设计修改问题，应当根据是否急需，已否施工，已否作了施工准备，已否备料，已调拨的材料能否调作他用，是否合理等不同情况决定是否修改设计和修改的程度，凡能改的就改，不能改的可以不改而继续施工，以求尽量避免或减少窝工和材料积压。在修改设计和降低标准时，还必须保证房屋的适用和质量，避免因此造成长期的不合理现象或更大的浪费。
    目前，各个基本建设部门都拟订了节约投资的计划。有很多基层单位也积极主动地采取节约措施，取得了很大的成绩。但是，也有个别单位没有很好地考虑各个工程不同的条件、地点和时间，而采取了不符合实际的节约措施，因而，产生了一些偏差。如果不及时纠正这些偏差，就会造成新的浪费，甚至给今后的建设和生产工作带来巨大的损失。这是必须防止的。
    有些单位不根据施工准备和施工进行的具体情况，简单地采取节约措施，就造成新的浪费。兰州地区有些建设单位原来决定非生产性房屋大都是修建二层到三层的楼房，设计单位已经进行了设计，施工单位已经准备了材料，调配了施工力量；但是，这些建设单位的主管部门，没有考虑当地的具体情况，却决定全部要改为平房，这就造成材料积压和窝工。兰州的地形是面临黄河，背靠高山，平地很少，如果全部盖平房，根本容不下这么多。本溪市建筑工程局承建的三幢三层楼宿舍工程，在五月初就已开工，现在暖气沟已经完成，暖气材料早已储备，却又将暖气设备全部削掉，不仅暖气沟白修了，而且还积压了材料。甚至有的工程百叶门已经做好也不用，另外再做普通门；有的工程模板已经支好，钢筋已经扎好，也被削掉了。这些都说明，不根据具体情况办事是行不通的。
    还有些单位只孤立地考虑目前的节约，而忽视了各个工程不同的用途和质量要求。像拖拉机制造厂的厂内道路，原决定采用三百号的混凝土，第一机械工业部为了“节约”，曾决定与一般普通道路一样，采用一百一十号混凝土。他们没有考虑将来这些道路是要行驶拖拉机的；幸而及时得到纠正，否则，使用低标号的混凝土承受不了拖拉机的重量，要被压坏，将来还得重修。这说明不周密分析具体情况，草率地修改设计，往往会妨碍工程质量和工程落成以后的长期使用，危害是很大的。
    为了防止影响工业建设速度，影响工程质量，造成新的浪费，在贯彻中央的节约方针的过程中，要反对一切不根据具体条件、不全面考虑问题的做法。但是，也决不容许有人以此为借口来抗拒中央的节约方针或在节约问题上打折扣。决不容许借口人员到齐了，材料准备好了，或者工期紧迫，工人技术水平低等等“理由”，对可以修改的设计也不修改，可以挪作他用的材料也不节约。执行中央的节约方针必须坚决、彻底；考虑具体的节约措施时必须慎重和实事求是。最近时期中，已经有许多单位的实践结果证明，在任何条件下，严格节约的要求都是可以达到的。拖拉机制造厂的宿舍工程，由于设计人员到现场去同施工人员共同研究，就地修改设计，结果在已开工的工程不停工、未开工的工程按期开工的情况下，节省了一百多万元的资金，超过了国家规定的标准。这说明，只要我们把全体职工的积极性创造性发挥起来，在今年内正确地实现和超额实现中央提出的在节约基本建设投资百分之十的基础上再节约百分之十五的要求是完全可能的。
