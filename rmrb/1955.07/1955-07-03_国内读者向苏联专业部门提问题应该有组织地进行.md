To the Editor:

　　Since the People's Daily published the news on March 23rd that the Ukrainian Experimental Institute of Ophthalmology, led by Academician Filatov of the Soviet Union, could treat nearsightedness, Academician Filatov has received many letters from China, many of which are written in Chinese. The letters generally describe the extent of their illness and request assistance with treatment. The end of the letters often reads "Please be sure to reply," etc. Academician Filatov attaches great importance to these letters, but there are very few people in Odessa who understand Chinese, so these letters have to be translated by Chinese students. There are not many students in Odessa, and there are no medical students at all. Many medical terms are impossible to find, which not only makes it easy to translate incorrectly, but also puts a lot of pressure on the students who have just arrived, as their own studies are already very heavy. In addition, Academician Filatov is already eighty years old. In order to enable the Academician to make more contributions to medicine in his later years, we believe it is necessary to make the following suggestions:

　　1. Domestic health departments or relevant agencies should find ways to introduce methods of treating nearsightedness as soon as possible;

　　2. It is best for patients to submit their questions to the Ministry of Health. After the Ministry of Health sorts out all the questions, it should then ask the Ukrainian Experimental Institute of Ophthalmology or Academician Filatov himself to provide a detailed answer;

　　3. When writing to foreign countries, it is best to translate the letter into a foreign language in China, or send the original letter with a translation. We believe that this is possible to do domestically. This would not only avoid translation errors, but also reduce some of the burden on international students.

### 国内读者向苏联专业部门提问题应该有组织地进行

　　国内读者向苏联专业部门提问题应该有组织地进行编辑同志：
    三月二十三日人民日报发表苏联费拉托夫院士领导下的乌克兰实验眼科研究院能够治疗近视眼的消息以后，费拉托夫院士收到许多从中国寄来的信，其中有许多信是用中文写的。信的内容大致上是说自己患病的程度，请求帮助治疗。信的末尾写着“请您一定回信”等等。费拉托夫院士很重视这些来信，但是敖德萨懂得中文的人很少，所以这些信都要请中国留学生翻译。敖德萨城的留学生不多，学医的同志根本没有，许多医学名称无处可查，这样不仅容易译错，而且由于同学们刚来不久，本身学习任务也很重，实在是心有余而力不足。另外，费拉托夫院士已是八十岁高龄的人，为了使院士在晚年能多在医学上有所创造，我们认为有必要提出下述建议：
    一、国内的卫生部门或有关机关尽快设法介绍治近视眼的方法；
    二、最好请患者有问题向卫生部提出，由卫生部整理出全部问题以后，再请乌克兰实验眼科研究院或费拉托夫院士本人做一次详细解答；
    三、向国外写信，最好在国内译成外文，或寄来原函并附译文。我们考虑，国内是有可能做到的。这样不仅可以避免翻译错误，也可以减少留学生的一些负担。
