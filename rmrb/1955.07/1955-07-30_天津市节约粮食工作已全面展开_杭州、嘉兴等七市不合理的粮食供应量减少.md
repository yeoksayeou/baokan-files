Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th: Tianjin has launched a city-wide grain conservation campaign. Before residents began formulating grain consumption plans, more than 45,000 reporters, propagandists, grain workers, and responsible persons from local police stations and street offices went deep into the streets and neighborhoods to publicize the significance of saving grain. As of the 20th, more than 90,000 households had already formulated grain consumption plans. Twenty households in Zhangjiaxi Hutong in the 7th District, after detailed calculation, determined that their grain consumption plan for July averaged more than two jin less per person than in the past. Many residents checked for grain waste when planning their family's grain consumption.

    Workers in textile, printing and dyeing, brewing, food, and other factories and workshops, which require more than six million jin of grain per month as raw materials, have researched many methods for saving grain and using substitutes. Recently, workers at the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory researched using sodium silicate with a small amount of starch instead of starch slurry in printing paste, with good results, saving more than 5,000 jin of grain per month. Now, many factory and workshop workers are striving to reduce their grain consumption targets by 10%. The staff of various groups and organizations, taking the lead in saving grain, used more than 920,000 jin less grain in July than in May.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: After further carrying out grain conservation activities in June, the unreasonable grain supply in seven cities in Zhejiang Province—Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Huzhou, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Shaoxing—has been further reduced. The grain sales volume of the seven cities in June decreased by 2.57% compared with May, and by 7.36% compared with April.

    Collective catering units such as organs, schools, factories, enterprises, and troops in these cities have conscientiously formulated and implemented grain consumption plans and promoted a new meal selling system. After 486 units in Hangzhou implemented the new meal selling system, the average daily grain consumption per person decreased by three liang and five qian compared with April and May, saving 400,000 jin of grain per month.

    Residents in various cities are formulating grain conservation plans. Residents in Hangzhou responded to the call of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to save grain and have generally formulated conservation plans. Many residents have switched to using substitutes instead of rice to feed chickens. The Huzhou Deputy Industry uses various substitutes instead of grain as raw materials, saving more than 40,000 jin of grain per month. The Hangzhou vegetable noodle industry and food stalls have changed from cooking rice to steaming rice, saving 100,000 jin of rice per month.

    天津市节约粮食工作已全面展开
    杭州、嘉兴等七市不合理的粮食供应量减少
    新华社天津二十六日电　天津市节约粮食活动已经在全市展开。在居民开始制定用粮计划以前，全市四万五千多名报告员、宣传员、粮食工作人员以及各派出所、街道办事处负责人等都深入各街道、里巷宣传节约粮食的意义。截至二十日止，已经有九万多户居民订出用粮计划。七区张家西胡同二十户居民，经过详细核算，订出的七月份的用粮计划，平均每人用粮量比过去减少了二斤多。不少居民订全家用粮计划时，都检查了浪费粮食的情况。
    每月需要六百多万斤粮食作原料的纺织、印染、制酒、食品等工厂、作坊的职工们，研究出了许多节约粮食和采用代用品的方法。最近第一印染厂职工，研究出在印花色浆里，用矽酸钠加上少量的淀粉代替淀粉浆液，效果良好，每月可节约五千多斤粮食。现在不少工厂、作坊的职工，正在为降低百分之十的用粮指标而努力。带头节约粮食的各团体、机关的工作人员，七月份用粮已比五月份减少九十二万多斤。
    新华社杭州二十七日电　浙江省杭州、嘉兴、宁波、湖州、温州、金华、绍兴七市，六月份进一步开展节约粮食活动后，不合理的粮食供应量又有减少。七个市六月份的粮食销售量比五月份减少百分之二点五七，比四月份减少百分之七点三六。
    这些城市的机关、学校、工厂企业、部队等集体伙食单位都认真制定和执行用粮计划，并推行了新的卖饭制度。杭州市四百八十六个单位实行新的卖饭制度后，平均每人每天的粮食消费量比四、五月份减少三两五钱，每月可节约粮食四十万斤。
    各市居民正在制定节约粮食的计划。杭州市居民响应中共杭州市委员会节约粮食的号召，普遍订出了节约计划。很多居民改用代用品代替米、饭喂鸡。湖州市复制业采用各种代用品代替粮食作原料，每月可节约粮食四万多斤；杭州市菜面业和饭摊改煮饭为蒸饭，每月可节约大米十万斤。
