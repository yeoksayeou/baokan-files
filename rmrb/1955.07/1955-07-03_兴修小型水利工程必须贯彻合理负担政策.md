　　Building Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects Must Implement a Policy of Reasonable Burden
　　Zhong Qiu
    Building small-scale water conservancy projects is extremely important for increasing agricultural production. This is a mass undertaking, and a policy of reasonable burden must be implemented.
    According to an inspection in Yunnan Province: In many areas of Yunnan, the interests of non-beneficiary households are being harmed in water conservancy construction work, "mobilizing" them to provide voluntary labor under the name of "unity and mutual assistance." Some not only do not give wages, but also require them to provide their own meals. When Kunyang County was building the Shuanglong Dam Reservoir, some non-beneficiary households within the beneficiary area were also made to do voluntary labor. For non-beneficiary households who provided labor, they were only given three jiao of wages per person per day, had to provide their own meals, and could only change shifts after a month. These unreasonable regulations caused dissatisfaction among some of the laborers, and some laborers left without saying goodbye. This situation also exists in other areas, seriously affecting the quality of the project and the completion of the construction plan.
    In order to correct this unreasonable situation, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has formulated some specific measures, requiring all localities to conduct in-depth inspections and earnestly implement the policy of "more benefit, more burden; less benefit, less burden; no benefit, no burden." The measures formulated by the Provincial Committee stipulate that the mobilization of laborers for the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects should be limited to beneficiary households; if it is necessary to mobilize non-beneficiary households to provide labor, it must be approved by the county and reasonable wages must be paid. For projects that have been completed but have not seriously implemented the policy of reasonable burden, if the masses have many opinions, they should be resolved reasonably and cautiously based on the actual situation. In the future, no non-beneficiary households shall be mobilized to participate in voluntary labor for the construction of water conservancy projects.
    The methods and principles put forward by the Yunnan Provincial Committee are very necessary for the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects. Other regions building small-scale water conservancy projects should check whether they have implemented the policy of reasonable burden, and must earnestly implement this policy. It is necessary to strictly implement the principle of "more benefit, more burden; less benefit, less burden; no benefit, no burden," and formulate some reasonable measures based on local conditions, correct all unreasonable burden situations, so as to facilitate the progress of water conservancy projects.

　　兴修小型水利工程必须贯彻合理负担政策
　　仲秋
    兴修小型水利对农业增产有极重大的关系。这是一种群众性的事业，必须贯彻合理负担的政策。
    据云南省检查：云南有不少地区，在水利兴修工作中，损害非受益户的利益，以“团结互助”为名，“动员”他们出义务工；有的不仅不给工资，还要他们自备伙食。昆阳县兴修双龙坝水库时，在受益区范围内，让部分非受益户同样进行义务劳动；对非受益区的出工户，每人每天只给三角工资，自带伙食，过一个月才能换班。这种不合理的规定，引起部分民工的不满，有的民工就不辞而去。这种情况在其他地区也有，严重地影响了工程质量和兴修计划的完成。
    中共云南省委为了纠正这种不合理的状况，拟定了一些具体的办法，要求各地进行深入的检查，认真贯彻“多受益多负担，少受益少负担，不受益不负担”的政策。省委拟定的办法中规定：兴修小型水利工程，动员民工应限于受益户；如必须动员非受益户出工，必须经县批准，并付给合理的工资。已经完成但未认真执行合理负担政策的工程，如群众意见很多，应该根据实际情况，慎重地予以合理解决。今后兴修水利工程，一律不得再动员非受益户参加义务劳动。
    云南省委提出的这些办法和原则，对兴修小型水利工程是十分必要的。其他兴修小型水利工程的地区，应该检查一下是否贯彻了合理负担的政策，一定要认真贯彻这个政策。必须严格实行“多受益多负担，少受益少负担，不受益不负担”的原则，并根据当地具体情况，规定一些合理的办法，纠正一切负担不合理的状况，以利水利工程的进展。
