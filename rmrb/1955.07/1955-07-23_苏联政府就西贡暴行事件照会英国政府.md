Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 22nd. TASS Moscow, July 22nd: As previously reported, on July 20th of this year, the houses of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam in Saigon and the Commission's personnel were attacked with the apparent connivance of the South Vietnamese authorities.

The aforementioned attack occurred on July 20th, the first anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, and also the time when representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and South Vietnam should have begun consultations on the issue of all-Vietnam general elections, as stipulated. The fact that this incident occurred at such a time demonstrates that the attack was premeditated and of a clearly provocative nature, with the aim of undermining the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina.

TASS has learned that Soviet leaders strongly condemn the provocative incident in Saigon. The Soviet government—whose representative was one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference—has sent a note to the British government—whose representative was also a chairman of the Geneva Conference discussing the Indochina issue—regarding this incident, suggesting that the attention of all participating countries in the Geneva Conference be drawn to the fact that the aforementioned actions taken against the International Commission directly violate Article 25 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, hinder the Commission's normal exercise of its functions, and thus pose a threat to the implementation of the Geneva Accords; it is suggested that the South Vietnamese authorities and the French government be required to take urgent measures to ensure the safety and normal working conditions of the International Commission in Vietnam, and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

    苏联政府就西贡暴行事件照会英国政府
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：前已报道，今年七月二十日，在越南南方当局明显的纵容下，越南国际监督和监察委员会在西贡的房屋和这个委员会的人员遭到袭击。
    上述袭击事件发生在七月二十日，即日内瓦协定签订一周年的时候，也是按照规定越南民主共和国和越南南方的代表应当开始就全越普选问题进行协商的时候。这一事件发生在这样一个时候，表明这次袭击是经过预先策划的，带有明显的挑衅性质，其目的是要破坏日内瓦协定和印度支那和平。
    塔斯社获悉，苏联领导人士坚决谴责西贡的挑衅事件。苏联政府——它的代表是日内瓦会议的主席之一，就这一事件照会英国政府——它的代表也是讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的主席，建议提请日内瓦会议的所有参加国注意，对国际委员会所采取的上述行动直接违反了越南停止敌对行动协定第二十五条，有碍于委员会正常地行使它的职权，因而为日内瓦协定的实现造成威胁；建议要求越南南方当局和法国政府采取紧急措施，以保障越南国际委员会的安全和正常的工作条件，防止将来发生类似事件。
