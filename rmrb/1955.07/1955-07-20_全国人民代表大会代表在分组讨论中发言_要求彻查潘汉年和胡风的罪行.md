Xinhua News Agency, 19th—Deputies attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress expressed their opinions in group discussions on the 19th, expressing their support for the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng.

    In the discussions of various delegate groups, the delegates expressed great anger at Pan Hannian's counter-revolutionary crimes. Speakers unanimously supported the correct measure of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in approving the arrest and trial of the extremely heinous counter-revolutionary Pan Hannian, and demanded a thorough investigation of Pan Hannian's crimes and severe punishment. Some delegates stated that the exposure of the Pan Hannian incident was another major victory for the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the country in their struggle against counter-revolutionaries. Some delegates pointed out that this victory, like the recent victory in crushing the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, shows that the Chinese Communist Party is wise and great. Only such a party, armed with Marxism-Leninism and tested in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, can resolutely remove all traitors and dissidents from its ranks, forever maintain the purity of its ranks, and deserve the highest trust of the people of the country. Many delegates stated that the people of the whole country must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely fight against all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

    Regarding the arrest and trial of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, the delegates considered it to be a very gratifying event. Many delegates pointed out that the materials published in the "People's Daily" regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique undoubtedly confirmed that the conspiracy activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were part of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They used double-dealing tactics to hide within the progressive people and carried out activities to sabotage the Chinese people's revolutionary cause and socialist construction cause from the ideological front. They are the most dangerous enemies of the Chinese people. The people of the whole country have long hated Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique to the bone. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress's approval of the arrest and trial of Hu Feng is entirely in line with the will and desire of the people of the whole country.

    Many delegates also expressed their feelings regarding the Pan Hannian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incidents. Some delegates analyzed the reasons for the increasingly acute and complex class struggle in our country during the transition period today, from the history of past revolutionary struggles and the current international and domestic situation, pointing out that the appearance of counter-revolutionaries is a phenomenon that conforms to the laws of class struggle. Some delegates believed that a profound lesson should be drawn from the Pan Hannian and Hu Feng incidents, that is, it is necessary to raise revolutionary vigilance, learn to distinguish hidden counter-revolutionaries who play double-dealing tactics, and remove them from our various fronts. Other delegates pointed out that counter-revolutionaries are despicable, ugly, and have no future. No matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, they will eventually be exposed and receive the punishment they deserve. Some delegates said that since counter-revolutionaries can infiltrate the Communist Party's organization, they can also infiltrate various democratic parties, people's organizations, state organs, and enterprises. Although they are only a very small number, if their activities are not exposed and stopped, they will bring major losses to the country and the people. Many delegates also reviewed their own paralysis of thought and peaceful concepts in connection with this issue, and criticized the phenomenon in some departments and regions of turning a blind eye to the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries or being excessively lenient.

    全国人民代表大会代表在分组讨论中发言
    要求彻查潘汉年和胡风的罪行
    新华社十九日讯　出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的代表们在十九日的分组讨论中，纷纷发表意见表示拥护将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判。
    在各个代表小组的讨论中，代表们对潘汉年的反革命罪行都表示极大的愤怒。发言的人都一致拥护全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准将罪大恶极的反革命分子潘汉年逮捕审判的正确措施，并要求彻底追查潘汉年的罪行，予以严惩。有的代表在发言时认为，潘汉年事件的被揭露，是中国共产党和全国人民在同反革命分子作斗争中又一次重大的胜利。有的代表指出：这次胜利和不久前粉碎高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的胜利一样，说明中国共产党是英明的和伟大的。只有这样一个为马克思列宁主义所武装起来的在反对内外敌人的斗争中久经考验的政党，才能坚决地从自己的队伍里清除一切叛徒和异己分子，永远地保持自己队伍的纯洁性，值得全国人民付予最高的信任。许多代表在发言中表示，全国人民必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，坚决地同一切暗藏的反革命分子作斗争，为社会主义建设事业贡献力量。
    对于反革命分子胡风被逮捕审判，代表们认为是一件大快人心的事。许多代表在发言中指出，“人民日报”所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，无可怀疑的证实胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动是帝国主义和蒋介石国民党的反革命阴谋活动的一部分，他们用两面派手段暗藏在进步人民内部，从思想战线上进行破坏中国人民革命事业和社会主义建设事业的活动，他们是中国人民最危险的敌人。全国人民对于胡风及其反革命集团早已恨之入骨，全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准将胡风逮捕审判，是完全符合于全国人民的意志和愿望的。
    许多代表还就潘汉年、胡风反革命事件发表了感想，有些代表从过去革命斗争的历史以及目前国际国内形势，分析了今天我国过渡时期阶级斗争日益尖锐和复杂的原因，指出反革命分子的出现是符合阶级斗争规律的现象。有的代表认为，从潘汉年、胡风的事件中，应该得出一条深刻的教训，这就是必须提高革命警惕性，学会辨别玩弄两面派手法的暗藏的反革命分子，并把他们从我们各个战线上清除出去。还有的代表指出，反革命分子是卑鄙的丑恶的和没有前途的，不管他们伪装得如何巧妙，他们终究是会被揭发出来，并受到应得的惩罚的。有的代表说，既然反革命分子可以钻到共产党的组织里面，他们也一定能够钻到各民主党派、人民团体、国家机关和企业部门，虽然他们只是极少数，而如果对他们的活动不加以揭露和制止，他们就会给国家和人民带来重大的损失。许多代表还联系这一问题检讨了自己的麻痹思想和太平观念，并且对有些部门和地区对反革命分子破坏活动熟视无睹或者宽大无边的现象提出了批评。
