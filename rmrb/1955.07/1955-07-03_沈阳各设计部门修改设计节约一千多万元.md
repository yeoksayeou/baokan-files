Following the study of Comrade Khrushchev's report at the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers, the Shenyang Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Shenyang Design Third and Fourth Branches of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, along with five other units, have continuously inspected and improved their work. As of June 16th, they have revised 346 unreasonable design projects, saving the country over 11,985,400 yuan in construction funds.

　　The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute originally designed a workers' village for a certain mine, with the designers, in pursuit of "socialist living standards," stipulating that each person would occupy a construction area of ​​ten square meters, totaling thirty-five square meters per household, exceeding the national standard by thirty percent. At the same time, they designed a five-kilometer asphalt road, equipped with eleven giant buses, and even designed two bus stations along the way. This design has been appropriately revised. Another example is the transportation equipment designed by the Shenyang Design Fourth Branch of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building for a certain factory. Originally, highly mechanized mining and transportation machines were to be used, requiring a capital investment of 65,800 yuan. Later, based on the current actual needs, it was changed to light handcarts, which alone reduced the country's investment by more than 47,900 yuan.

　　Currently, all units are continuing to inspect and revise unreasonable projects in their designs.

　　沈阳各设计部门修改设计节约一千多万元
    重工业部有色冶金设计院沈阳分院，第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳设计三、四分局，和沈阳煤矿设计院等八个单位从三月上旬开始学习赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作人员会议上的报告以后，不断检查和改进工作，截至六月十六日止，共修改了三百四十六项不合理的设计项目，给国家节省一千一百九十八万五千四百多元的建设资金。
    沈阳煤矿设计院原先给某矿井设计的工人村，设计人员为了追求“社会主义生活标准”，拟定每人所占的建筑面积为十平方公尺，每户共为三十五平方公尺，超过国家指标百分之三十；同时设计了一条长达五公里的柏油马路，配以巨型客车十一辆，在途中还设计了两个汽车站。这项设计已经做了适当地修改。又如第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳设计四分局给某厂设计的运输装备，原来是采用高度机械化采运机来运输的，需用资金六万五千八百元，后来根据目前实际需要情况改为轻便手推车，只这一项就可以减少国家投资四万七千九百多元。
    现在各单位正继续对设计中不合理的项目进行检查和修改。
