　　Instruction of the State Council on Establishing a Regular Household Registration System
　　(Adopted at the 11th Plenary Session of the State Council on June 9, 1955)

　　The population census and registration work of 1953 has laid the foundation for establishing a regular household registration system. At present, this system has begun to be established or has undergone necessary deployment in most areas. In order to do this work well, the following instructions are hereby given:

　　1. The national household registration administration shall be managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the civil affairs departments of the people's committees above the county level. The organs handling household registration are public security police stations in cities and market towns, and township (town) people's committees in rural areas and market towns without public security police stations.

　　2. In areas where household registration was originally handled by public security police stations, the Provisional Regulations on Urban Household Administration promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security on July 16, 1951, shall continue to be followed. In rural areas and market towns without public security police stations, township (town) people's committees shall establish township (town) household registers and registration books for births, deaths, removals, and entries. The township (town) household register shall register the permanent residents of the entire township (town), and shall be filled in or canceled at any time according to population changes, in order to grasp the actual population of the entire township (town). The four types of registration books for births, deaths, removals, and entries shall be used to register population changes at any time, in order to grasp the population changes. The contents and methods of registration are prescribed as follows:
　　A. Birth: Within one month after the birth of an infant, the infant's father, mother, or other related person shall report to the local township (town) people's committee where the infant's parents are located, or report to the person in charge of the local administrative organization below the township (town) level (such as the group leader, village head, etc.) for forwarding to the township (town) people's committee for entry into the birth registration book.
　　B. Death: In the case of normal death, the householder or other related person shall report to the local township (town) people's committee within one month after the death, or report to the person in charge of the local administrative organization below the township (town) level for forwarding to the township (town) people's committee for entry into the death registration book; in the case of abnormal death (such as suicide, homicide, unknown cause of death, etc.) and death from infectious diseases, the householder or other related person shall immediately report to the person in charge of the local administrative organization below the township (town) level, or directly report to the local township (town) people's committee for registration, in order to investigate and deal with the matter.
　　C. Removal (including marriage-related removal): When the entire household or an individual changes permanent residence, the householder or the individual shall handle the matter according to the following provisions before moving out: When changing permanent residence within the original township (town) area, report to the township (town) people's committee. Only registration of change of address will be made, and no removal procedures will be handled; when moving out of the original township (town) area but not out of the county, a removal certificate shall be obtained from the township (town) people's committee, and the township (town) people's committee shall enter it into the removal registration book; when moving out of the county, a removal certificate shall be obtained from the township (town) people's committee or introduced by the township (town) people's committee to the higher-level household registration authority, and the township (town) people's committee shall enter it into the removal registration book. Removal procedures shall be completed for those who have been away for more than six months. The removal of landlords and rich peasants who have not changed their status must be approved by the district office or the county people's committee; the removal of persons deprived of political rights, serving sentences outside prison, on probation, on parole, and under surveillance must be reported to and approved by the county and city judicial organs or public security organs before handling the removal procedures in accordance with the above provisions. The removal certificate shall be uniformly printed by the public security department.
　　D. Entry (including marriage-related entry): When the entire household or an individual moves to a new residence, the householder or the individual shall report to the person in charge of the local administrative organization below the township (town) level within five days after arrival, and submit the removal certificate or present other certificates for verification. The local township (town) people's committee shall, based on the report of the person in charge of the administrative organization and after reviewing the certificates, enter it into the entry registration book.

　　Household registration changes caused by divorce, separation, cohabitation, disappearance, recovery, adoption, recognition, employment, dismissal, etc., shall be reported by the householder or the individual to the local township (town) people's committee, or reported to the person in charge of the local administrative organization below the township (town) level for forwarding to the township (town) people's committee to handle registration or cancellation in accordance with the provisions for removal and entry.

　　3. Registration of public household registrations of organs, organizations, schools, enterprises, and other institutions: In areas with public security police stations, the public security police stations shall handle it; in rural areas and market towns without public security police stations, the township (town) people's committees shall handle it, and each organ, organization, school, enterprise, and other unit shall designate a special person to be responsible for assisting.

　　4. The statistical time for household registration is tentatively set once a year. Township (town) and other areas shall report the household change figures for the entire previous year to the county in February each year, the county shall summarize and report to the province in March each year, and the province shall summarize and report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in April each year.

　　In areas within the county where household registration is handled by public security police stations, the public security police stations shall report the household change figures within their jurisdiction to the county public security bureau for summary and forwarding to the county civil affairs section in accordance with the time reported by township (town) and other areas. The city's household change figures shall be submitted by the city public security bureau to the city civil affairs department for reporting to the provincial civil affairs department in accordance with the time reported by the county to the province. The household change figures of municipalities directly under the central government shall be submitted by the public security bureau to the civil affairs bureau and reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs before the end of April each year.

　　5. The provincial people's committees and autonomous organs of autonomous regions may formulate flexible methods suitable for local conditions and customs in various ethnic minority areas within their regions, and report household registration figures in accordance with the flexible methods. The flexible methods formulated by various places shall be reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for record.

　　6. The regular household registration system has just begun to be established, and there is still a lack of work experience. People's committees at all levels must conscientiously do a good job in publicity, education, and organization in carrying out this work: They should strengthen inspection, supervision, and specific guidance to the relevant departments under their jurisdiction. County and autonomous county people's committees should, at appropriate times, convene personnel engaged in household registration work in each township (town) (township clerks, civil affairs committee members, and public security committee members) in a unit of one or several districts for short-term training, explain and discuss the spirit and practices of this instruction in detail, and conduct regular publicity and education to the broad masses of the people through them. By doing so, we will be able to strive to gradually establish and improve the regular household registration system within a few years.

　　The provincial, autonomous region, and municipal people's committees should report any experiences and problems in implementing this instruction to the Ministry of Internal Affairs at any time.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai

　　国务院关于建立经常户口登记制度的指示
　　（一九五五年六月九日国务院全体会议第十一次会议通过）
      一九五三年的人口调查登记工作，已为建立经常的户口登记制度奠立了基础，目前这一制度在大部分地区已经开始建立，或者进行了必要的部署。为了做好这项工作，特作如下指示：
      一、全国户口登记行政，由内务部和县级以上人民委员会的民政部门主管。办理户口登记的机关，在城市、集镇是公安派出所，在乡和未设公安派出所的集镇是乡、镇人民委员会。
      二、原由公安派出所办理户口登记的地方，仍按照一九五一年七月十六日公安部公布的城市户口管理暂行条例办理。乡和未设公安派出所的集镇，乡、镇人民委员会应当建立乡、镇户口簿和出生、死亡、迁出、迁入登记册。乡、镇户口簿登记全乡、镇的常住人口，并且根据人口变动，随时填入或者注销，以掌握全乡、镇实有人口的情况。出生、死亡、迁出、迁入四种登记册，随时登记变动人口，以掌握人口变动的情况。登记的内容和办法规定如下：
    甲、出生：婴儿在出生后一个月内，应由婴儿的父、母或者其他关系人报告婴儿父、母当地乡、镇人民委员会，或者报告当地乡、镇以下行政组织的负责人（如组长、屯长等）转报乡、镇人民委员会登入出生登记册。
    乙、死亡：正常死亡，应当在死亡后一个月内，由户主或者其他关系人报告当地乡、镇人民委员会，或者报告当地乡、镇以下行政组织的负责人转报乡、镇人民委员会登入死亡登记册；非正常死亡（如自杀、被杀、死因不明等）和传染病死亡，户主或者其他关系人应当立即报告当地乡、镇以下行政组织的负责人，或者直接报告当地乡、镇人民委员会登记，以便查明处理。
    丙、迁出（包括婚出）：全户或者个人变动常住所的时候，应由户主或者本人在迁出以前按照下列规定办理：在原乡、镇地区以内变动常住所的，报告乡、镇人民委员会，只作住所变更的登记，不办迁出手续；迁出原乡、镇地区但不出县境的，应当向乡、镇人民委员会领取迁移证，并由乡、镇人民委员会登入迁出登记册；迁出县境的，应当向乡、镇人民委员会或者由乡、镇人民委员会介绍到上一级户口主管机关领取迁移证，并由乡、镇人民委员会登入迁出登记册。外出六个月以上的应当办理迁出手续。未改变成分的地主分子的迁出，必须经区公所或者县人民委员会批准；被剥夺政治权利、监外执行、缓刑、假释和被管制分子的迁出，必须报经县、市司法机关或者公安机关的批准，再照以上规定办理迁出手续。迁移证由公安部门统一印制。
    丁、迁入（包括婚入）：全户或者个人迁到新住地的时候，应由户主或者本人在到达后五天内报告当地乡、镇以下行政组织的负责人，并且交出迁移证或者缴验其他证件。当地乡、镇人民委员会根据行政组织负责人的报告并审查证件后，登入迁入登记册。
    由于离婚、分居、合居、失踪、寻回、收养、认领、雇工、解雇等原因引起的户口变动，都应由户主或者本人报告当地乡、镇人民委员会，或者报告当地乡、镇以下行政组织负责人转报乡、镇人民委员会按迁出迁入的规定办理登记或者注销。
    三、机关、团体、学校、企业等公共户口的登记：设有公安派出所的地区由公安派出所办理，在乡和未设公安派出所的集镇由乡、镇人民委员会办理，并由各机关、团体、学校、企业等单位指定专人负责协助。
    四、户口登记的统计时间，暂定每年一次。乡、镇等地区应当在每年的二月将上年全年的户口变动数字统计报县，县在每年的三月汇总报省，省在每年的四月汇总报内务部。
    县境内由公安派出所办理户口登记的地方，公安派出所应按照乡、镇等地区上报的时间，将所辖区域内户口变动数字报由县公安局汇总后转送县民政科。市的户口变动数字，应由市公安局按照县上报省的时间交市民政部门报省民政厅。直辖市的户口变动数字，应由公安局交民政局于每年四月底前报内务部。
    五、省人民委员会和自治区自治机关都可以对本区内各少数民族地区制定适合当地情况和习惯的变通办法，并且按照变通办法上报户口数字。各地制定的变通办法应报内务部备查。
    六、经常的户口登记制度刚刚开始建立，工作经验还很缺乏，各级人民委员会在进行这一工作中，必须认真做好宣传教育和组织工作：对所属有关部门，应加强检查督促和具体指导。县、自治县人民委员会应在适当的时候，以一个区或几个区为单位，召集各乡、镇办理户口工作的人员（乡文书、民政委员和治安委员）进行短期训练，将本指示的精神和作法详细讲解和讨论清楚，并且通过他们对广大人民群众进行经常的宣传教育。这样做，我们就能够争取在几年之内，将经常的户口登记制度逐步地建立和健全起来。
    各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在执行本指示中有何经验和问题，望随时报告内务部。
                  总理　周恩来
                    一九五五年六月二十二日
