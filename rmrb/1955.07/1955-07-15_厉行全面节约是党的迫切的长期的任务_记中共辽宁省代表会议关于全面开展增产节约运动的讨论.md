The resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy calls on "all comrades of the Party must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this plan"! The First Representative Meeting of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, held from June 24th to 29th, discussed the situation and problems in Liaoning Province regarding increasing production and practicing economy, and how to comprehensively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, based on the spirit of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It enhanced the ideological understanding of the comrades present and determined the future measures.

The meeting used the weapon of self-criticism to expose a large number of wasteful phenomena in various aspects and resolved to fight to overcome all waste in future work.

In capital construction, the main problem is treating non-productive construction the same as productive construction. Many representatives' speeches reflected that many places violated the Party's repeated teachings on the principle of focusing on key construction, which is mainly manifested in excessive investment in non-productive construction projects, a small number of buildings being too luxurious, and some that are not currently urgently needed being blindly built prematurely. The non-productive buildings of the newly built silk spinning factory accounted for 16% of the total investment. They also divided the bathhouses they built into three types: employee bathhouses, section chief bathhouses, and factory director bathhouses. Fushun City invested 130,000 yuan to lay pipelines and build civilian gas, but the mine can only supply two years of gas, and the income for two years cannot even recover half of the labor costs. Xuechi Street in Shenyang is a residential area without industry, but the city also plans to invest 310,000 yuan to build asphalt roads. The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute designed a huge administrative and welfare complex building for the 104 mine construction project, which is very small in scale, and also set up fully automated washing machines, clothing transport machines, drying machines, electric ironing machines, dust removal machines, and other equipment. This design exceeded the original national standard by 59%, wasting 250,000 yuan. Before the completion of the LÃ¼da Potassium Chlorate Factory, asphalt roads were laid and a clubhouse was built. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company built a tuberculosis sanatorium, including auxiliary projects such as water sources, bridges, and roads, with a cost of 370 yuan per square meter. All of this clearly violates the state's principle of focusing on key construction.

In urban construction, it is manifested in being divorced from reality and blindly pursuing "socialist standards." Some cities blindly planned central squares, green areas, north-south axes, radial roads, ring roads, etc., regardless of needs and possibilities. It stipulated that buildings on main streets should be four to five stories high, and those near the central square should be seven to nine stories high, and there were only long-term plans and no short-term plans. As a result, the buildings were scattered, public utilities encountered difficulties, and a lot of waste was caused. A sanatorium in Qianshan pursued being "the first in the country" and spent 10 million yuan, but the water source problem has not been resolved yet. In the rural areas of Liaoning Province, in order to pursue "modernization" and "standardization," brick and tile structure district health centers were also built; however, due to excessive management costs, most of them were left idle after completion, wasting resources in vain. The result of such blind construction is that it greatly disperses the state's limited funds and violates the principle of improving people's lives on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity.

The meeting also exposed wasteful phenomena in production plants and mines, such as ignoring product quality and financial cost management, excessively high raw material reserves, production being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, ignoring safe production, low recovery rates and actual collection rates, and wasting state resources and raw materials, as well as wasteful phenomena in state-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises.

The meeting analyzed the root causes of all waste phenomena in the Liaoning region. Many facts revealed by the meeting proved that some Party members had forgotten the Party's fine tradition of hard struggle and pursued a bourgeois lifestyle, spending lavishly and competing for luxury. Therefore, they not only used state funds for non-productive construction but also lived extravagantly in their daily lives. After the Shenyang Municipal Procuratorate increased its staff last year, the purchase expenses were budgeted at 48,500 yuan. In addition to buying new cars, they also bought a large number of sofas, swivel chairs, spring chairs, and even bought basketball hoops even though there was no basketball court. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company already had a flower cellar and spent 6,700 yuan to build a new flower cellar and sent people to Hangzhou to purchase flowers. A factory in Fushun held a groundbreaking ceremony, inviting a large number of guests, watching operas, and issuing silver commemorative medals, spending about 40,000 yuan. These wasteful behaviors that deviated from the living standards of the masses and the current economic conditions squandered a large amount of state funds casually. The Party organization lacked strict supervision in this regard and did not conduct a vigorous struggle against this bad tendency.

Secondly, the Party organization failed to establish an atmosphere among the broad masses of workers of hating waste and supervising each other. According to the financial settlement statistics of the Liaoning Provincial State-owned Commercial Department in 1954, various losses caused by poor work or negligence in work throughout the year amounted to more than 5.1 million yuan. Among them, the losses caused by the deterioration and mold of goods due to poor storage amounted to more than 320,000 yuan. In Shenyang, seventy trainloads of five-eye cloth shoes had rust on the eyelets, and toothpaste and vanishing cream hardened. In Andong, a department store supply station had 55,000 dozens of socks bitten by mice. All of this could have been avoided. The situation in industrial and mining enterprises and grain departments is also serious in this regard.

The meeting believed that if this waste phenomenon is not quickly overcome, it will definitely increase the difficulties in socialist construction and affect the speed of socialist industrialization.

The meeting discussed and studied how to comprehensively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy in the future and formulated several specific measures.

The meeting believed that this comprehensive increase production and practice economy movement must take comprehensively implementing the Party's policies, comprehensively improving leadership, comprehensively improving enterprise management, and comprehensively completing the national plan as the overall requirements. All departments must, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and in accordance with this overall requirement, combine with the specific circumstances of their own departments, put forward different priorities and problems, grasp the key to the increase production and practice economy movement, put forward the increase production and practice economy plan of their own unit, and ensure the smooth progress of the increase production and practice economy movement. The meeting believed that in order to make the increase production and practice economy movement develop regularly and healthily, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses and comprehensively implement the Party's policies; improve leadership style; systematically study the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts; and thoroughly eliminate the bad influence of Gao Gang and his anti-Party clique in this regard. To this end, it requires Party organs at all levels, especially leading cadres, to overcome bureaucratic work style, go deep into the grassroots level and the masses in a planned and focused manner, and specifically and meticulously check the progress of the movement. The representatives' speeches reflected that the bureaucratic work style of many Party organizations and Party members is serious. They are accustomed to squatting in the organs to hold meetings and write reports. They cannot go deep into the grassroots level and the masses, conduct serious investigations and research, and specifically care about the lives of the masses. Even in the minds of some people, they feel that making some mistakes of pragmatism and bureaucracy is both common and universal, and also unavoidable. This idea is of course completely wrong. The Party organization can only go deep into the masses, mobilize the masses, and attract millions of people to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement; only by striving to overcome the bureaucratic work style that is divorced from the masses and further combining the improvement of leadership style with the comprehensive launch of the increase production and practice economy movement can this ensure that the increase production and practice economy movement is carried out persistently and normally, and avoid turning the increase production and practice economy movement into a shock movement; avoid the phenomenon of starting with a bang, dispersing with a bang, being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and ending in a fiasco.

The meeting believed that in order to make the increase production and practice economy movement develop regularly and healthily, it is necessary to enable the Party's policies to be comprehensively implemented and thoroughly eliminate Gao Gang's bad influence in this regard. In the past, in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas, there had been an erroneous deviation of opposing tasks and policies. Many cadres only knew how to ensure the completion of tasks and often neglected and forgot to implement the Party's policies, so they could not arrange and carry out their work in accordance with the requirements of the Party's policies. Some leading cadres also only explained tasks and did not explain policies and methods when arranging work, and only checked the completion of tasks without checking whether the entire activity of completing the tasks conformed to the Party's policies. In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the state-owned enterprises in Liaoning region have achieved remarkable results in the increase production and practice economy movement launched by relying on the broad masses of workers. However, because Gao Gang and his anti-Party clique used the achievements of industrial production in Northeast China as their anti-Party capital, in the increase production movement in 1951 and 1952, many units had made mistakes in simply pursuing figures, exaggerating achievements, concealing shortcomings and errors, and even deceiving the state. For example, putting together several figures of different nature and rendering them as a huge achievement in increasing production and practicing economy. What is especially serious is that these erroneous practices have promoted the development of bourgeois individualism and capitalist management thinking. Gao Gang's bad influence is also manifested in the Party's work, focusing on ensuring the completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy, neglecting the comprehensive leadership and supervision of the increase production and practice economy movement, and lacking criticism and struggle against deviations that violate the Party's guidelines and policies, which has seriously affected the healthy development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

The meeting also conducted detailed discussions on other issues of increasing production and practicing economy.
