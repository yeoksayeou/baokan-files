The resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy calls on "all comrades of the Party must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this plan"! The First Representative Meeting of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, held from June 24th to 29th, discussed the situation and problems in Liaoning Province regarding increasing production and practicing economy, and how to comprehensively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, based on the spirit of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It enhanced the ideological understanding of the comrades present and determined the future measures.

The meeting used the weapon of self-criticism to expose a large number of wasteful phenomena in various aspects and resolved to fight to overcome all waste in future work.

In capital construction, the main problem is treating non-productive construction the same as productive construction. Many representatives' speeches reflected that many places violated the Party's repeated teachings on the principle of focusing on key construction, which is mainly manifested in excessive investment in non-productive construction projects, a small number of buildings being too luxurious, and some that are not currently urgently needed being blindly built prematurely. The non-productive buildings of the newly built silk spinning factory accounted for 16% of the total investment. They also divided the bathhouses they built into three types: employee bathhouses, section chief bathhouses, and factory director bathhouses. Fushun City invested 130,000 yuan to lay pipelines and build civilian gas, but the mine can only supply two years of gas, and the income for two years cannot even recover half of the labor costs. Xuechi Street in Shenyang is a residential area without industry, but the city also plans to invest 310,000 yuan to build asphalt roads. The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute designed a huge administrative and welfare complex building for the 104 mine construction project, which is very small in scale, and also set up fully automated washing machines, clothing transport machines, drying machines, electric ironing machines, dust removal machines, and other equipment. This design exceeded the original national standard by 59%, wasting 250,000 yuan. Before the completion of the Lüda Potassium Chlorate Factory, asphalt roads were laid and a clubhouse was built. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company built a tuberculosis sanatorium, including auxiliary projects such as water sources, bridges, and roads, with a cost of 370 yuan per square meter. All of this clearly violates the state's principle of focusing on key construction.

In urban construction, it is manifested in being divorced from reality and blindly pursuing "socialist standards." Some cities blindly planned central squares, green areas, north-south axes, radial roads, ring roads, etc., regardless of needs and possibilities. It stipulated that buildings on main streets should be four to five stories high, and those near the central square should be seven to nine stories high, and there were only long-term plans and no short-term plans. As a result, the buildings were scattered, public utilities encountered difficulties, and a lot of waste was caused. A sanatorium in Qianshan pursued being "the first in the country" and spent 10 million yuan, but the water source problem has not been resolved yet. In the rural areas of Liaoning Province, in order to pursue "modernization" and "standardization," brick and tile structure district health centers were also built; however, due to excessive management costs, most of them were left idle after completion, wasting resources in vain. The result of such blind construction is that it greatly disperses the state's limited funds and violates the principle of improving people's lives on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity.

The meeting also exposed wasteful phenomena in production plants and mines, such as ignoring product quality and financial cost management, excessively high raw material reserves, production being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, ignoring safe production, low recovery rates and actual collection rates, and wasting state resources and raw materials, as well as wasteful phenomena in state-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises.

The meeting analyzed the root causes of all waste phenomena in the Liaoning region. Many facts revealed by the meeting proved that some Party members had forgotten the Party's fine tradition of hard struggle and pursued a bourgeois lifestyle, spending lavishly and competing for luxury. Therefore, they not only used state funds for non-productive construction but also lived extravagantly in their daily lives. After the Shenyang Municipal Procuratorate increased its staff last year, the purchase expenses were budgeted at 48,500 yuan. In addition to buying new cars, they also bought a large number of sofas, swivel chairs, spring chairs, and even bought basketball hoops even though there was no basketball court. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company already had a flower cellar and spent 6,700 yuan to build a new flower cellar and sent people to Hangzhou to purchase flowers. A factory in Fushun held a groundbreaking ceremony, inviting a large number of guests, watching operas, and issuing silver commemorative medals, spending about 40,000 yuan. These wasteful behaviors that deviated from the living standards of the masses and the current economic conditions squandered a large amount of state funds casually. The Party organization lacked strict supervision in this regard and did not conduct a vigorous struggle against this bad tendency.

Secondly, the Party organization failed to establish an atmosphere among the broad masses of workers of hating waste and supervising each other. According to the financial settlement statistics of the Liaoning Provincial State-owned Commercial Department in 1954, various losses caused by poor work or negligence in work throughout the year amounted to more than 5.1 million yuan. Among them, the losses caused by the deterioration and mold of goods due to poor storage amounted to more than 320,000 yuan. In Shenyang, seventy trainloads of five-eye cloth shoes had rust on the eyelets, and toothpaste and vanishing cream hardened. In Andong, a department store supply station had 55,000 dozens of socks bitten by mice. All of this could have been avoided. The situation in industrial and mining enterprises and grain departments is also serious in this regard.

The meeting believed that if this waste phenomenon is not quickly overcome, it will definitely increase the difficulties in socialist construction and affect the speed of socialist industrialization.

The meeting discussed and studied how to comprehensively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy in the future and formulated several specific measures.

The meeting believed that this comprehensive increase production and practice economy movement must take comprehensively implementing the Party's policies, comprehensively improving leadership, comprehensively improving enterprise management, and comprehensively completing the national plan as the overall requirements. All departments must, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and in accordance with this overall requirement, combine with the specific circumstances of their own departments, put forward different priorities and problems, grasp the key to the increase production and practice economy movement, put forward the increase production and practice economy plan of their own unit, and ensure the smooth progress of the increase production and practice economy movement. The meeting believed that in order to make the increase production and practice economy movement develop regularly and healthily, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses and comprehensively implement the Party's policies; improve leadership style; systematically study the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts; and thoroughly eliminate the bad influence of Gao Gang and his anti-Party clique in this regard. To this end, it requires Party organs at all levels, especially leading cadres, to overcome bureaucratic work style, go deep into the grassroots level and the masses in a planned and focused manner, and specifically and meticulously check the progress of the movement. The representatives' speeches reflected that the bureaucratic work style of many Party organizations and Party members is serious. They are accustomed to squatting in the organs to hold meetings and write reports. They cannot go deep into the grassroots level and the masses, conduct serious investigations and research, and specifically care about the lives of the masses. Even in the minds of some people, they feel that making some mistakes of pragmatism and bureaucracy is both common and universal, and also unavoidable. This idea is of course completely wrong. The Party organization can only go deep into the masses, mobilize the masses, and attract millions of people to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement; only by striving to overcome the bureaucratic work style that is divorced from the masses and further combining the improvement of leadership style with the comprehensive launch of the increase production and practice economy movement can this ensure that the increase production and practice economy movement is carried out persistently and normally, and avoid turning the increase production and practice economy movement into a shock movement; avoid the phenomenon of starting with a bang, dispersing with a bang, being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and ending in a fiasco.

The meeting believed that in order to make the increase production and practice economy movement develop regularly and healthily, it is necessary to enable the Party's policies to be comprehensively implemented and thoroughly eliminate Gao Gang's bad influence in this regard. In the past, in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas, there had been an erroneous deviation of opposing tasks and policies. Many cadres only knew how to ensure the completion of tasks and often neglected and forgot to implement the Party's policies, so they could not arrange and carry out their work in accordance with the requirements of the Party's policies. Some leading cadres also only explained tasks and did not explain policies and methods when arranging work, and only checked the completion of tasks without checking whether the entire activity of completing the tasks conformed to the Party's policies. In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the state-owned enterprises in Liaoning region have achieved remarkable results in the increase production and practice economy movement launched by relying on the broad masses of workers. However, because Gao Gang and his anti-Party clique used the achievements of industrial production in Northeast China as their anti-Party capital, in the increase production movement in 1951 and 1952, many units had made mistakes in simply pursuing figures, exaggerating achievements, concealing shortcomings and errors, and even deceiving the state. For example, putting together several figures of different nature and rendering them as a huge achievement in increasing production and practicing economy. What is especially serious is that these erroneous practices have promoted the development of bourgeois individualism and capitalist management thinking. Gao Gang's bad influence is also manifested in the Party's work, focusing on ensuring the completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy, neglecting the comprehensive leadership and supervision of the increase production and practice economy movement, and lacking criticism and struggle against deviations that violate the Party's guidelines and policies, which has seriously affected the healthy development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

The meeting also conducted detailed discussions on other issues of increasing production and practicing economy.

    厉行全面节约是党的迫切的长期的任务
    ——记中共辽宁省代表会议关于全面开展增产节约运动的讨论
    本报记者  陆灏
    党的全国代表会议关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议号召“全党同志必须在中央的领导下，团结全国各族人民群众，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成这个计划而奋斗”！中共辽宁省委员会自六月二十四日起至二十九日召开的第一次代表会议，根据党的全国代表会议的精神，对于辽宁省增产节约方面的情况、问题以及如何全面开展增产节约运动进行了讨论，提高了到会同志的思想认识，并确定出今后的措施。
    会议运用自我批评的武器，大量地揭露了各方面的浪费现象，并决心在今后工作中为克服一切浪费而斗争。
    在基本建设中，主要的问题是把非生产性的建设和生产建设同样看待。许多代表的发言中反映了许多地方违背了党所一再教导的重点建设的方针，这主要表现在投资于非生产性的建设项目过多，少数建筑过于豪华，有些目前并不迫切需要的，也盲目地过早兴建。新建的绢纺工厂的非生产性建筑占投资总额的百分之十六，他们修建浴池还要分成职工浴池、科长浴池、厂长浴池三种。抚顺市投资十三万元敷设管道，建设民用煤气；但矿山只能供给两年煤气，而两年的收入却连一半人工的费用都收不回来。沈阳雪耻街是没有工业的居民区，该市也拟投资三十一万元修建柏油马路。沈阳煤矿设计院为规模很小的一○四矿井建设工程设计了庞大的行政福利联合大楼，其中还设置了全部自动化的洗衣机、运衣机、干燥机、电烫机、除尘机等设备，这个设计超过国家原来的标准百分之五十九，浪费二十五万元。旅大氯酸钾厂在工厂建成以前，就先铺好了柏油马路，盖好了俱乐部。本溪钢铁公司修建了一个肺结核疗养院，包括水源、桥梁、道路的附属工程在内，每一平方公尺造价竟达三百七十元。所有这一切显然违反了国家重点建设的方针。
    在城市建设上，则表现了脱离实际，盲目追求“社会主义标准”。有些城市不根据需要和可能，盲目地规划了中心广场、绿化地区、南北轴线、放射道路、环市马路等等，规定房屋建筑主要街道四层到五层，中心广场附近的要七层到九层，而且只有长期计划，并无近期计划，结果建筑分散，公用事业发生困难，造成了不少浪费。千山有个疗养院，追求“全国第一”，花费了一千万元，但水源问题至今还没有解决。在辽宁省的农村里，为了追求“现代化”、“标准化”，也修建了红砖瓦结构的区卫生所；但由于管理费用过高，修完了以后，只好大部分闲着，白白浪费。这样盲目兴建的结果，就大大地分散了国家有限的资金，违反了在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上提高人民生活的原则。
    会议还揭发了在生产厂矿中忽视产品质量和财务成本管理，原材料储备偏高，生产时松时紧，忽视安全生产，回采率和实收率低，浪费国家资源和原料等浪费现象，以及国营商业和合作社的浪费现象。
    会议对于辽宁地区产生一切浪费现象的根源进行了分析。会议揭发的很多事实证明了若干党员把我党艰苦奋斗的优良传统忘掉了，而去追求资产阶级生活方式，挥霍无度，竞赛豪华。因此，他们不仅把国家资金用于进行非生产性的建设，而且在日常生活上也是铺张浪费。沈阳市检察署去年增加了若干人员后，购买费就预算了四万八千五百元，他们除买了新轿车，还买了大批的沙发、转椅、弹簧椅，甚至虽然没有篮球场，也买了篮球架子。鞍山钢铁公司已有花窖，竟又用六千七百元新修一个花窖，并派人到杭州采购鲜花。抚顺有一个工厂举行开工典礼，大量请客、看戏、发银质纪念章，开支达四万元左右。这些脱离群众生活水平和当前经济条件的浪费行为，把一大笔国家资金随随便便花费掉了。而党的组织在这方面则缺乏严格的监督，没有对这种恶劣的倾向进行有力的斗争。
    其次，党的组织没有能够在广大工作人员中树立对于浪费人人痛恨和互相监督的风气。据辽宁省国营商业部门一九五四年财务决算的统计，因为工作作得不好，或者是因为工作中的过失，全年造成的各种损失达五百一十多万元。其中由于保管不善造成商品变质霉烂方面的损失就达三十二万元之多。沈阳有七十辆车皮的五眼便鞋的鞋眼上生了锈，牙膏、雪花膏硬化。安东有一个百货供应站，有五万五千打袜子给老鼠咬坏。而这一切本来都是可以避免的。在工矿企业部门、粮食部门，这方面的情况也是严重的。
    会议认为：如不迅速克服这种浪费现象，必定会增加社会主义建设中的困难，影响到社会主义工业化的速度。
    会议对于今后如何全面开展增产节约的问题进行了讨论和研究，并规定了若干具体措施。
    会议认为：这次全面增产节约运动，必须把全面贯彻党的政策、全面改进领导、全面改进企业管理、全面完成国家计划作为总的要求。各部门都必须根据中央的指示，按照这一总的要求，结合本部门的具体情况，提出不同的重点和问题，掌握增产节约运动的关键，提出本单位的增产节约计划，保证增产节约运动的顺利进行。会议认为要使增产节约运动经常地健康地开展，必须深入发动群众，全面地贯彻党的政策；改善领导作风；系统地学习苏联和贯彻苏联专家的建议；彻底肃清高岗及其反党宗派在这方面的恶劣影响。为此，要求各级党的机关，特别是领导工作人员，必须克服官僚主义作风，有计划有重点地深入基层，深入群众，具体地细致地检查运动的进展情况。代表们的发言反映出不少党的组织和党员的官僚主义作风是严重的，他们习惯于蹲在机关里开会、写报告。他们不能很好地深入基层，深入群众，认真地调查研究，具体地关心群众的生活。甚至在有些人的心里，他们觉得犯点事务主义、官僚主义的错误，这是既平常而又普遍的，也是难以避免的。这种想法当然是完全错误的。党的组织只有深入群众，发动群众，并吸引千百万群众参加到增产节约运动里来；只有努力克服了脱离群众的官僚主义作风，并进一步地把改善领导作风和全面开展增产节约运动结合起来，这才能使增产节约运动持久地正常地进行，才能避免把增产节约运动搞成突击运动；避免一轰而起，一轰而散，忽紧忽松和虎头蛇尾的现象。
    会议认为：为使增产节约运动经常地健康地开展起来，必须使党的政策能够全面地贯彻，彻底肃清高岗在这方面的恶劣影响。过去，在工矿企业和农村中，曾经发生过把任务和政策对立起来的错误偏向。不少干部只知道保证完成任务，常常忽略和忘记了贯彻党的政策，因而不能按照党的政策要求来安排和进行自己的工作。有的领导干部在布置工作中也只交代任务，不交代政策方法，只检查完成任务情况，不检查完成任务的整个活动是否符合党的政策。几年来辽宁地区的国营企业，在党中央和毛泽东同志正确领导下，依靠广大职工开展的增产节约运动，收到了显著成绩。但因为高岗及其反党宗派把东北工业生产上的成绩作为他们的反党资本，因而在一九五一年、一九五二年的增产运动中，不少单位曾经发生了单纯追求数字，夸大成绩，掩盖缺点和错误，甚至欺骗国家的错误行为。如将几个不同性质的数字凑在一起，渲染为增产节约的巨大成绩。尤其严重的是这些错误作法助长了资产阶级个人主义和资本主义经营思想的发展。高岗的恶劣影响还表现在党的工作上，偏重于对完成增产节约任务的保证，忽视对增产节约运动的全面领导和监督，对违反党的方针、政策的偏向缺乏批判和斗争，这就严重地影响了增产节约运动的健康发展。
    会议对于增产节约的其他问题也进行了详尽的讨论。
