Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
Some Evil Activities of Hu Feng Element Peng Baishan in Shanghai
Li Jiajian
　　Peng Baishan is one of the elements of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Peng Baishan once held quite important positions in Party organs, in the army, and in government organs. Hu Feng once said complacently about this, "Bai can hold the line in East China," which shows that Hu Feng attached great importance to Peng Baishan.
　　The importance that the counter-revolutionary ringleader Hu Feng attached to Peng Baishan was by no means accidental, but was based on ideological consistency and a "long-standing" "friendship." From the time of the "Left League," Peng Baishan and Hu Feng were already working together. For a long time, Peng Baishan and Hu Feng had close relations. In the early spring of 1950, when Peng Baishan's unit was stationed in Xuzhou, Peng Baishan invited Hu Feng to "be a guest" at the Xuzhou military base. When Hu Feng arrived in Xuzhou, he lived in Peng Baishan's "mansion," and Peng Baishan used his car to pick him up and take him around. Peng Baishan also personally came forward to contact people everywhere in Xuzhou, organizing a grand welcoming meeting for Hu Feng, inviting Hu Feng to promote reactionary literary and artistic theories to the military and local cultural and educational cadres. Peng Baishan also boasted at the meeting for Hu Feng, saying: "Mr. Hu Feng is a famous Chinese writer, literary theorist, critic, and a veteran in Chinese literary circles," and so on. That night, Peng Baishan summoned some young cultural workers to his home, letting Hu Feng "chat casually" with everyone. Later, when Peng Baishan's unit was transferred to Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, Hu Feng and his wife Mei Zhi went to the Songjiang County military base again to "be guests." Peng Baishan's relationship with Hu Feng became even closer during the period when Peng Baishan worked in the East China Cultural Department. Peng Baishan repeatedly tried to get the Party to reuse Hu Feng by writing letters and lobbying to leading comrades, trying to find ways and "encourage" him to join the Party. When there was really no way, Peng Baishan even wanted to arrange for Hu Feng to join the People's Liberation Army.
　　In recent years, Peng Baishan has used his important working positions in East China and Shanghai to sing a common tune with the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and has used his authority to undermine the cultural undertakings of East China and Shanghai.
　　Strangling the Popularization of Cultural and Artistic Work
　　Peng Baishan has always looked down on the popularization of cultural and artistic work, despised the cultural and artistic activities of the working masses, and one-sidedly emphasized improvement, spreading the fallacy that "the more improved the works, the more popular they will be" to counter the Party's literary and artistic policy.
　　In 1952, not long after Peng Baishan came to work in the East China Cultural Department, he openly stated: "The literary and artistic units of the government system only need to face the peasants. The workers' literary and artistic work will be taken care of by the trade unions themselves, and we can ignore it." The concrete implementation of this one-sided and erroneous "leadership" thinking resulted in the fact that at that time, very few theater troupes went to industrial and mining areas to tour, and the cultural centers in large and medium-sized cities in East China had unclear directions and could not carry out their work. Later, Peng Baishan even used the excuse that Shanghai's situation was special to abolish all the cultural centers in the urban area, causing serious damage to the cultural work of the masses.
　　Beginning on December 1, 1954, the "Liberation Daily," in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of working people, made some reforms to the third edition, using concise articles to reflect the lives of the working people and publish more works by the working people. After the reform, it was generally welcomed by the broad masses of working people, but it was opposed by Peng Baishan. He seized on some shortcomings in certain articles and criticized them repeatedly, saying that the works of the workers published in the "Liberation Daily" were of too low a standard and did not look like articles. In fact, this was just an excuse. Peng Baishan has always looked down on the creation of workers and has always looked down on workers. On January 4 of the same year, at the Shanghai factory grassroots cultural and educational cadres conference held by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, he said: "Cultivating new writers is a big problem. Cultivating workers is only one aspect. It is impossible to rely entirely on workers, because: 1. Workers have poor culture and poor living conditions; 2. Leaders do not pay attention (Note: If this refers to Peng Baishan himself, it is very appropriate!). Now we must cultivate them from young students." Once, the editorial department of the "Liberation Daily" planned to hold a forum for worker authors to solve the urgent problems existing among the current worker literary and artistic workers, and invited Peng Baishan to participate and help; but Peng Baishan always used the excuse of "no time" to refuse to participate in this forum. It is precisely because Peng Baishan despised the works of workers, peasants and soldiers, and adopted this kind of nihilistic and suppressive attitude towards worker creation, that the literary and artistic creation of Shanghai workers has been in a state of no leadership for a long time.
　　Obstructing the Propaganda Work of Drama Performances with Revolutionary Struggle as the Theme
　　Hu Feng denied the significance of literature reflecting the major political struggles of the people and expressing urgent themes in reality. Peng Baishan used his working position to adopt various vicious means to attack and strangle works reflecting important themes of revolutionary struggle.
　　In November 1953, the drama "Heroic Position" was performed in Shanghai. This was a drama with the theme of expressing the collective heroism and overall concept of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It was of great educational significance to the people of Shanghai. In order to expand the influence of this performance, help the broad audience to further understand the practical significance of the script and improve their artistic appreciation ability, the "Liberation Daily" organized a commentary: "Heroic Position and Its Performance." This paper analyzed and criticized the ideological and artistic nature of the script. Although some of the analysis was not deep or concrete enough, the propaganda for this performance was timely, and it was helpful for readers to correctly appreciate this performance. However, Peng Baishan completely negated this criticism with the label that this criticism "basically did not break out of the circle of formalism," and did not allow this commentary to be published, obstructing and suppressing the propaganda work for this drama performance.
　　The East China Regional Drama Performance in 1954 was a major event in the cultural life of the people in Shanghai and East China. The "Liberation Daily" was prepared to carry out planned propaganda and commentary work, to explain the significance of this performance to the broad masses of people, and to guide the broad audience to correctly appreciate the performances of these dramas. However, Peng Baishan adopted another kind of ulterior attitude. To give two examples: The "Liberation Daily" organized a paper commenting on the script "People Who Plant Oranges" (written by Qu Baiyin). The paper clearly pointed out at the beginning: "The script 'People Who Plant Oranges' is a work with relatively successful ideological and artistic qualities. The fact that this work comes from the hands of a young playwright is even more worthy of cherishing." And a more specific analysis of the content of the script was carried out. We believe that it is helpful to publish this commentary in a timely manner for readers to appreciate the performance of this script. However, Peng Baishan instructed: "The author's intention is good. Because the position and method he adopted are incorrect, he cannot correctly reflect the Party's opinion." "Do not publish it in the Liberation Daily." And instructed: "In the future, when organizing manuscripts, we must strive for correctness, and do not rush to avoid being passive." Facts have proved that this article is not as he said, and it was published in "Drama News" not long after; at the same time, when the "Liberation Daily" organized this commentary article, the performance was almost over, the performance judging committee had made a preliminary conclusion, and this script was also prepared to be performed for a short period of time and then not performed. How can this be labeled with the big hat of "rushing"? Yes, it is to make the Hu Feng clique "passive" by timely propaganda of this kind of work reflecting the revolutionary struggle. Is this not clear enough?
　　The means adopted by Peng Baishan in obstructing and attacking the "Liberation Daily's" propaganda of literary and artistic works reflecting the revolutionary struggle were very clever and insidious. He knew that in propaganda work, time is a very important factor, so he adopted the method of delaying time. When denying the commentary on "Heroic Position," he asked the staff of the "Liberation Daily" to re-"carefully study the report on drama creation recently published by Simonov," and "organize a forum (it is recommended that the Writers Association host it), and talk about it once"; when denying the commentary on "People Who Plant Oranges," he said, "I have already talked to Comrade Wu Qiang, and asked him to write a good commentary and publish it in the Liberation Daily," "At the same time, I will introduce you to a critical article by Comrade Qu Qiubai more than 20 years ago, 'Talking about Three People,' so that you can understand how to grasp Marxist-Leninist literary criticism." These words, on the surface, do not seem to have anything to criticize, but according to the situation at that time, everyone was busy with other work, and the meeting was not so easy to hold, and another commentary article could not be realized in the short term. In essence, Peng Baishan was just using these beautiful words to cover up his sinister purpose.
　　Negating National Literary and Artistic Heritage and National Forms, Strangling Cultural and Artistic Undertakings
　　On the issue of national heritage, Peng Baishan used his usurped position to implement Hu Feng's reactionary instructions without any concealment.
　　In 1952, the first measure he took when he came to work in the East China Cultural Department was to take the excuse of streamlining the organization and arbitrarily announced the dissolution of the East China Academy of Traditional Opera. He arrogantly said: "Chinese opera is a product of feudal society. Everything is very backward. There is no need to retain it at all; Zhou Xinfang and Yuan Xuefen are just two 'opera singers'. Why should they be raised so high?" Therefore, it is necessary to abolish the hospital's establishment, dissolve the Peking Opera Experimental School, stop the "Opera News," and separate the Peking Opera and Yue Opera troupes. This matter caused dissatisfaction among the comrades of the East China Academy of Traditional Opera, and some people raised objections. At this time, Zhou Yang, the Vice Minister of the Central Cultural Department, happened to pass through Shanghai and stopped this rude behavior. The East China Academy of Traditional Opera was spared from being dissolved. But Peng Baishan did not stop there. Since the hospital headquarters could not be dissolved, many important business cadres were transferred away, so that this institution could not play any role. He insisted on dissolving the Peking Opera Experimental School. The predecessor of the Peking Opera Experimental School was the famous Children's Troupe of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. During the Liberation War, this troupe traveled to every division of the entire army, performing for the soldiers on the battlefield full of artillery fire. It performed more than 400 performances in three years, which not only enriched the cultural life of the troops, but also inspired the fighting enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters. Therefore, these children were loved by the commanders and fighters. After the victory of the Liberation War, in order to improve their professional level, the Third Field Army handed the Children's Troupe over to the local government to cultivate them. Before leaving, Commander Chen Yi personally spoke to the children, encouraging them to study hard, saying: "The troops are limited by conditions and it is difficult to improve you. Go to the local government, and they will cultivate you very well." But now the Peking Opera Experimental School was dissolved by Peng Baishan. Some of them were introduced to other troupes or schools, and some were dismissed. They suffered a tragic fate. Wu Gong, a teacher named Huang Shengfang, who was originally a teacher in the Children's Troupe, was dismissed and had no means of support. He once wandered the streets. Some of the children who were introduced to the Hangzhou Great World have become degenerate in their lives because they have not continued to receive education and training. Peng Baishan's behavior not only caused irreparable losses to the opera business, but also seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government.
　　After Peng Baishan came to the East China Cultural Department, he once said publicly to reporters from the newspaper: "Peking Opera has no future. Let it fend for itself." The reporters asked the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau: "Does this sentence violate the central policy?" This sentence of Peng Baishan's caused great confusion in the opera industry.
　　In 1953, Shanghai held an art exhibition. After visiting this exhibition, everyone believed that the Chinese painters in Shanghai had made achievements in reflecting new themes, which was a gratifying phenomenon; however, when Peng Baishan went to visit the exhibition, he shook his head when he saw the Chinese paintings as soon as he entered the door of the exhibition hall, and he kept shaking his head until he walked out of the venue. In 1954, the East China Artists Association held a landscape painting exhibition for the old painter Huang Binhong. We asked Comrade Lai Shaoqi to write a short commentary and published a landscape painting by Mr. Huang Binhong. After Peng Baishan saw the newspaper in the morning, he seized on some shortcomings in Comrade Lai Shaoqi's article and immediately called the editorial department to severely criticize it, saying that this was a "directional and principled error." This caused great dissatisfaction among art workers.
　　Peng Baishan was also deeply disgusted with folk music. After the Central Conservatory of Music's East China Branch rectified its work style in literature and art, it worked hard to correct the tendency to despise learning folk music. When they performed some folk music programs for the first time in foreign performances, Peng Baishan was very dissatisfied after hearing them. He said to a responsible comrade of the college in a commanding tone: "These things (referring to folk music) should be sung by those artists. Don't sing them!" Another time, Peng Baishan went to the East China Branch of the Conservatory of Music and saw a folk music data exhibition. As soon as he walked into the door of the exhibition, he warned the staff present: "You should pay attention to a problem when you do this!" What exactly is the problem? The staff present had no idea. So they asked him what problem he should pay attention to, and he hesitated and said: "Your problem should be studied carefully!" Finally, he wrote in the opinion book in a seemingly clear but unclear manner: "National form is not equal to folk music." It turns out that what Peng Baishan wanted people to pay attention to was not the Party's literary and artistic policy, but Hu Feng's reactionary theory!
　　People can see that because Peng Baishan is hiding in the Party and has more power than Hu Feng, isn't his destruction of national heritage more ferocious than Hu Feng's?
　　Suppressing Criticism, Protecting the Hu Feng Clique
　　In January 1953, Peng Baishan wrote a paper entitled "Several Issues Concerning Writers Going to Factories and Rural Areas." In this paper, Peng Baishan separated and opposed the expression of the Party's policies and ideas in literary works and the expression of people. Taking the film "Southward and Northward Wars" as an example, he attacked it vigorously. The so-called "strategic thinking cannot be used as the theme" actually stripped away the political nature of literary types, cancelled the Party's principles in creating literary types, and openly opposed literature serving politics.
　　Peng Baishan's paper, which contained serious errors, was published in the January 1953 issue of "Literary and Art Monthly," but he wanted the "Liberation Daily" to reprint it and wanted it to be published on the day the "Literary and Art Monthly" was published. The editorial department of the "Liberation Daily" discovered the above-mentioned errors of principle and called Peng Baishan to raise them. Not only did he not accept the opinions, but he also said rudely: "I am personally responsible for any errors." He insisted on publishing his paper.
　　After this paper with errors of principle was published in the newspaper, the newspaper's editorial department received many responses from readers pointing out the erroneous views in Peng Baishan's paper. One reader wrote a paper entitled "Literature Can and Should Express the Party's Policies and Ideas" to refute Peng Baishan's fallacies. The editorial department believed that the arguments in this article were basically correct. Since there were different opinions on this issue, it was necessary to start a discussion in the newspaper to clarify the issue. Therefore, the editorial department sent the editorial department's opinions along with the reader's article to Peng Baishan for his consideration. Peng Baishan said in his reply:
　　I have read the article you sent. This is the most popular view at the moment. It uses the Party's signboard to scare some non-Party and young writers. This is not allowed. In fact, he himself lacks common sense and gets into a dead end. There is no result or meaning in arguing. …At present, in the guidance of literary and artistic thought, the emphasis is on explaining the problem from the positive side. Do not guide the debate, especially when the theoretical foundation is still weak.
　　It must be explained that the reader who wrote this article is just a young man who loves literature. Is it you, Peng Baishan, who is using the Party's signboard to scare the young man, or is the young man scaring you? Obviously, he is using his position in the Party to treat the young man unreasonably, to stifle the development of literary and artistic criticism, and to brutally and domineeringly attack the reader's criticism of him.
　　In August 1954, the editorial department of the "Liberation Daily" formulated a plan to carry out literary and artistic criticism based on the specific situation of literary and artistic work in Shanghai, preparing to systematically criticize some of the main works published in Shanghai by members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and Liu Xueyu's reactionary literary and artistic thought. However, as soon as the first review of the novel "There Is No Winter Here" by Hu Feng member Ji Fang was published, it was immediately attacked by Peng Baishan.
　　The newspaper published the article criticizing "There Is No Winter Here" on August 29. On September 2, Peng Baishan convened a so-called "Forum on Literary and Artistic Criticism Issues" in the name of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. Peng Baishan had never convened such a meeting to discuss literary and artistic criticism during his tenure in Shanghai. The sudden convening of such a meeting was enough to make people ponder. At the meeting, Peng Baishan appeared to be "leading" the development of literary and artistic criticism on the surface and did not dare to openly negate this review; however, he targeted this review and said that "what attitude is adopted towards the petty bourgeoisie in politics cannot be separated from what attitude is adopted in literary and artistic criticism. The Soviet Union does not have this problem. It will not solve the problem if you use the Soviet Union's literary and artistic standards to measure it." Did Peng Baishan not know what kind of person Ji Fang was and what kind of ideas he was promoting? But he wanted to accuse the Party newspaper of not distinguishing the "boundary" when criticizing Ji Fang's article!
　　However, Peng Baishan still thought that the staff of the editorial department did not understand what he meant, and was afraid that the Party newspaper would continue to do so. He was so anxious that he couldn't bear it. Two days later, he personally "arrived" at the editorial department of the "Liberation Daily" (this is also rare!) to find the responsible comrades of the editorial department and issued clear "instructions." He said that the review of Ji Fang's "There Is No Winter Here" published by the "Liberation Daily" was not comprehensive enough and did not write out the good aspects of this book; moreover, when publishing this review, it was not "passed" by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, which made them very passive. Therefore, he said: Don't engage in such criticism in the future. The responsible comrades of the editorial department asked: How will literary and artistic criticism be carried out in the future? What is the central issue of literary and artistic criticism at present? He said: The central issue is that the guiding ideology is not unified, and it is currently impossible to carry out literary and artistic criticism. It is very clear here: How can his "guiding ideology" be unified with ours? If we want to launch a struggle against Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought, he will naturally come out to interfere and say "impossible."
　　On September 5 and 19, 1954, the "Liberation Daily" successively published two literary essays, "Shill and Substitute" and "Mirror of History." The content of these two literary essays was to criticize the reactionary thoughts and behaviors of the Hu Feng members in the New Literature and Art Publishing House. In "Shill and Substitute," the Hu Feng members were accused of using "formalism and conceptualization" as a cover to stifle the literary and artistic creation of workers, peasants and soldiers and the creation of works reflecting major political struggle themes, while secretly trafficking reactionary literary and artistic works; in "Mirror of History," the Hu Feng members were accused of attempting to raise the mistakes of "The Life of Wu Xun" to exonerate themselves and escape people's stern criticism of them. Of course, looking at it now, these two articles are not sharp or profound enough in their presentation of the issues, and even their names have not been mentioned. Peng Baishan was very unhappy that "Shill and Substitute" was not sent to him before it was published, and he blamed a responsible comrade of the Liberation Daily for this, saying that such manuscripts should not be published without showing them to him. "Mirror of History" was sent to Peng Baishan for his review before it was published, and he wrote the following passage:
　　There is no problem with this manuscript in principle. But solving such a problem is a complex ideological struggle process.
　　At present, it is not that the entire guiding ideology of this publishing house has problems, but that some of the people in it have this kind of petty-bourgeois ideological problem. Ideological criticism should be carried out within it, and criticism in the newspaper can play a coordinating role; if criticism is not organized internally, a single point in the newspaper will not have a major effect. Because these people cannot be alerted and consciously checked by tapping them lightly. Therefore, publishing it will not have much effect, but it can also be published if you want to.
　　In this "instruction," we can clearly see that Peng Baishan only described the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members entrenched in the New Literature and Art Publishing House as so-called "petty-bourgeois ideological problems," and even tried to use various excuses to cancel out even the slightest criticism of this kind of "ideological problem." Later, the article "Mirror of History" was still published, and he came out to criticize it again. Because he was occupying the position of Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at that time, under his continuous attacks and obstruction, everyone had no choice but to stop writing, and the original plan of a set of "literary essays" to fight against the Hu Feng members was eliminated by him.
　　In early October 1954, the editorial department of the "Liberation Daily" again invited a paper to criticize Lu Ling's reactionary collection of short stories "Seeking Love." The editorial department sent the proof that had been typeset to Peng Baishan for his review. This time, he could not find any excuse, so he simply wrote two big characters in red:
　　"Do not publish."
　　Peng Baishan's suppression and attacks on these manuscripts criticizing the Hu Feng members were going hand in hand with the Hu Feng members' counterattacks against the Party newspaper.
　　After the "Liberation Daily" published a review criticizing Ji Fang's novel "There Is No Winter Here" on August 29, 1954, and published letters from two readers on September 5, expressing their support for this criticism, the editorial department immediately received a letter from Ji Fang with ulterior motives. The letter said: "Your newspaper published the opinions of comrades Zheng Lin and Lü Peiying on 'There Is No Winter Here' on September 5. I would like to communicate and discuss with them directly. Please tell me the contact information of these two comrades." Not long after this, Mei Lin, one of the Hu Feng members, also said in a brief conversation with a comrade from the newspaper that such a problem was an internal problem of the publishing house and should be resolved within the publishing house. Aren't these arguments exactly the same as what Peng Baishan said?
　　In this way, the entire reporting plan of the "Liberation Daily" to criticize the reactionary literary and artistic thoughts of the Hu Feng clique was completely destroyed by Peng Baishan using the position he had usurped in the Party. He did not disappoint Hu Feng's attention. He "held the line" in Shanghai and protected the Hu Feng members.
　　Conspiracy to Wash Away Crimes and Get Away with It
　　From some of the materials revealed above, people can clearly see that Hu Feng member Peng Baishan has been implementing Hu Feng's anti-socialist program for a long time, and has been "embracing" closely with Hu Feng for a long time. Peng Baishan did indeed "hold the line" in East China as Hu Feng expected. However, when Hu Feng instructed his followers to "write articles" and "never be passive" in an attempt to preserve their strength and continue to lurk and do evil, Peng Baishan hurriedly wrote a so-called article "On Hu Feng's Anti-Marxist View of Realism" and asked the editorial department to publish it immediately. At the beginning of the article, he raised a shield, indicating that he had fought against Hu Feng long ago. In order to explain this problem, it is useful to quote a section for everyone to see:
　　As early as the spring of 1938, Cao Bai wrote a prose piece commemorating a revolutionary soldier who died in battle, entitled "Yang Kezhong." The author initially sent it to me for my consideration. I thought that he was using a petty-bourgeois sentimental tone to express the death of the revolutionary soldier, and it was a failed work. At that time, I wrote a short letter to the author to give him some opinions. …
　　The above letter was not prepared for publication in advance, nor was it expected to be the object of criticism. However, this was not the case. As soon as this letter was transferred from Cao Bai to Hu Feng, it was published in the eighth issue of "July" and became the object of Hu Feng's struggle.
　　Here, Peng Baishan is actually showing off to people: "Look, I have already become the object of Hu Feng's struggle as early as 1938. Am I, Peng Baishan, still a member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique?" However, even in this article, Peng Baishan tried his best to cover up the fox's tail with the beautiful words of Marxism, but this fox's tail was still revealed. In the last paragraph of the article, Peng Baishan pointed out for Hu Feng: "Humbly learning, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, and resolutely fighting against his own wrong ideas, still have a bright future." Peng Baishan's description of Hu Feng's "future" is so fascinating!
　　This first article could not be published, so Peng Baishan hurriedly wrote the second article, "On the Anti-Marxist View of Hu Feng's Creation," the content of which was empty and dull. It was just what Hu Feng said he could "criticize Hu," and the purpose was still to "never be passive."
　　Really, after Peng Baishan's own article was published, he became "active." At a meeting attended by the theory and education section chiefs of the propaganda departments of various districts, he shamelessly instructed the comrades attending the meeting to convey his arrangements to the district committees (he wanted everyone to take careful notes): "...The reports criticizing Hu Feng should be made by each district based on my article." At that time, someone at the meeting said that his article could not refute Hu Feng, and Peng Baishan said bluntly: "The basic arguments of this article are all there and there is nothing wrong."
　　However, no matter how insidious and cunning Peng Baishan is, it is impossible to get away with it in front of the awakened people and in front of the powerful Communist Party. Now, the only way out for Peng Baishan is to confess everything thoroughly, bow his head and admit his guilt, and repent and start anew. Otherwise, he will cut himself off from the people!

　　坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
　　胡风分子彭柏山在上海的一些罪恶活动
　　黎家健
    彭柏山是胡风反革命集团分子之一，彭柏山在党的机关中、在军队中、在政府机关中都曾经窃踞过相当重要的职位。胡风曾经因此而自得地说过“柏在华东可以顶住”，可见胡风对彭柏山是十分重视的。
    反革命头子胡风对彭柏山的重视，绝不是偶然的，而是建立在思想一致和“历史悠久”的“友谊”基础上的。从“左联”时期开始，彭柏山就和胡风搭在一起了。长时期以来，彭柏山和胡风往来密切。一九五○年初春，彭柏山所在的部队驻扎徐州的时候，彭柏山曾经邀请胡风到徐州部队驻地“作客”。胡风到达徐州的时候，就住在彭柏山的“公馆”里，出入都由彭柏山用小汽车接送，彭柏山还亲自出马，在徐州到处联络人，组织了一个隆重的欢迎胡风的大会，请胡风向部队和地方上的文教干部，宣扬反动的文艺理论。彭柏山还在大会上为胡风吹嘘说：“胡风先生是中国著名的作家，文艺理论家，批评家，胡风先生是中国文艺界的老前辈”，等等。当天晚上，彭柏山又召集了一部分青年文化工作者到他家里，让胡风和大家“随便谈谈”。后来，彭柏山所在的部队调防到江苏省松江县来了，胡风和他的妻子梅志又到松江县部队驻地去作了一次“客”。彭柏山调到华东文化部工作时期同胡风的来往更加密切起来了。彭柏山曾经多次用给领导同志写信和游说的办法，设法要党重用胡风，替胡风想办法、“鼓励”他混到党里来，实在没有什么办法时，彭柏山还想把胡风安插到人民解放军中去。
    这几年来，彭柏山利用窃踞华东和上海市的一些重要的工作地位，同胡风反革命集团的分子唱着一个共同的曲子，并且利用职权，摧残着华东和上海的文化事业。
　  扼杀文化艺术的普及工作
    彭柏山一向轻视文化艺术的普及工作，轻视工人群众的文化艺术活动，片面强调提高，散布什么“愈是提高的作品愈能普及”的谬论，来对抗党的文艺方针。
    一九五二年，彭柏山到华东文化部工作没有多久就公开地提出：“政府系统的文艺工作单位只要面向农民就可以了。工人的文艺工作，工会自己会负责，我们可以不管。”这种片面的、错误的“领导”思想具体实行的结果，就使当时的剧团很少到工矿区去巡回演出，使华东地区大中城市文化馆方针不明，工作无法开展。后来，彭柏山甚至借口上海情况特殊，要撤销市区所有的文化馆，使群众的文化工作受到严重的损害。
      一九五四年十二月一日开始，“解放日报”为了适应广大劳动人民的需要，对第三版进行了一些改革，用短小精悍的文章体裁，更多地反映劳动人民的生活，更多地刊载劳动人民的作品。改革后，受到了广大劳动人民的普遍欢迎，但是却遭受了彭柏山的反对。他抓住某些文章中的一些缺点，三番五次地批评，说“解放日报”发表的工人们的作品水平太低，不像是文章。事实上，这只不过是一个借口而已。彭柏山从来就轻视工人们的创作，从来就看不起工人。在同年一月四日在上海总工会举行的上海工厂基层文教干部大会上，他就这样说过：“培养新作家是个大问题。培养工人只是一面，如果完全寄托在工人身上，不可能。因为：一、工人文化差，生活条件苦；二、领导不重视（按：假如是指彭柏山自己倒是很恰当的！）。现在要从青年学生中培养。” 有一次，“解放日报”编辑部计划召开一次工人作者座谈会，来解决当前工人文艺工作者中存在的急需解决的问题，请彭柏山来参加并予帮助；但彭柏山一直以“没有时间”作借口，拒绝了参加这个座谈会。正由于彭柏山轻视工农兵的作品，对工人创作采取了这种取消主义的打击态度，使上海工人的文艺创作长期处于无领导状态。
　  阻挠对于以革命斗争为题材的戏剧演出的宣传工作
    胡风否认文学反映人民的重大政治斗争和表现现实中的迫切题材的意义，彭柏山更利用他的工作地位，采取各种恶毒的手段，对反映革命斗争重要题材的作品予以打击和扼杀。
      一九五三年十一月，话剧“英雄的阵地”在上海演出了，这是一个以表现中国人民解放军的集体英雄主义和整体观念为主题的话剧，对上海人民来说，是有很大的教育意义的。为了扩大这次演出的影响，帮助广大观众进一步理解剧本的现实意义和提高艺术的欣赏能力，“解放日报”组织了一篇评论：“英雄的阵地及其演出”。这篇论文从剧本的思想性和艺术性进行了分析批判，有些地方分析得虽然不够深刻、具体，但对这次演出的宣传是及时的，对读者正确地欣赏这次演出是有一定的帮助的。但是，彭柏山以这篇批评“基本上没有脱出公式主义的圈子”的帽子，完全否定了这篇批评，不准这篇评论发表，阻挠了和压抑了对这个话剧演出的宣传工作。
    一九五四年华东区话剧会演，是上海和华东地区人民文化生活中的大事，“解放日报”准备有计划地进行宣传和评论工作，向广大人民说明这次会演的意义，指导广大观众正确欣赏这些话剧的演出。但是，彭柏山却采取了另外一种不可告人的态度。举两个例子来说：“解放日报”组织了一篇评剧本
  “种橘的人们”的论文（瞿白音作），论文一开始就明确指出：“剧本‘种橘的人们’是一个思想性与艺术性都较有成就的作品。这作品出于青年剧作家之手这一事实，更值得珍视。”并对剧本内容进行了较具体的分析。我们认为，及时地把这篇评论发表出来，对读者欣赏这个剧本的演出是有帮助的。然而，彭柏山却批示说：“作者的用意是好的。由于他所采取的立场和方法不对，因而不能正确反映党的意见。”“不要在解放日报发表。”并指示说：
  “今后组织稿件，要力求正确，不要抢先，以免被动。”事实证明，这篇文章并不如他说的那样，不久就在“戏剧报”发表了；同时，“解放日报”组织这篇评论文章的时候，会演已快结束了，会演评判委员会已做了初步结论，这个剧本也准备公演一个短时期就不演出了。这怎么扣得上“抢先”的大帽子呢？是的，报纸及时宣传这种反映革命斗争的作品，是要使胡风集团“被动”的，这难道还不明白吗？
    彭柏山在阻挠和打击“解放日报”对反映革命斗争的文艺作品的宣传时，所采取的手段是非常巧妙和阴险的。他知道，在宣传工作中，时间是一个很重要的因素，因此就采取了拖延时间的办法，在否定有关“英雄的阵地”的评论时，要“解放日报”工作人员重新“仔细研究最近发表西蒙诺夫那篇关于戏剧创作的报告”，“组织一次座谈会（建议作家协会主持），漫谈一次”；在否定有关“种橘的人们”的评论时，说“我已跟吴强同志谈过，要他好好写一篇评论，在解放日报发表”，“同时，我介绍你们看瞿秋白同志在二十多年前有一篇‘谈谈三人行’的批评文章，就可以懂得应当怎样掌握马列主义的文艺批评”。这些话，从表面上看起来，似乎并没有什么可以非议的地方，但是根据当时的情况，大家正忙于其他工作，会并不是那么容易开得起来的，另外写一篇评论文章也不是在短期内可以兑现的。实质上，彭柏山只不过是用这些漂亮的话来掩饰他的阴谋目的罢了。
　  否定民族文艺遗产和民族形式，扼杀文化艺术事业
    在对待民族遗产这个问题上，彭柏山利用他所窃踞的地位，更毫无掩饰地执行着胡风的反动指令。
    一九五二年，他到华东文化部工作的第一个措施，就是借口精简机构，擅自宣布解散华东戏曲研究院。他狂妄地说：“中国的戏曲是封建社会的产物，一切都很落后，根本没有保留的必要；周信芳、袁雪芬不过是两个‘唱戏的’，为什么把他们抬得这么高？”因此要撤销院部建制，解散京剧实验学校，停办“戏曲报”，把京剧、越剧两个剧团独立起来。这件事情，引起了华东戏曲研究院同志们的不满，有些人并提出了反对的意见。这时，刚好中央文化部周扬副部长路过上海，制止了这种粗暴的行为，华东戏曲研究院才免被解散。但是彭柏山并没有因此罢休，院部既然不能解散，就把许多重要的业务干部调走，使这个机构不能发生任何作用。对京剧实验学校，坚持解散。京剧实验学校的前身就是中国人民解放军第三野战军著名的娃娃剧团。在解放战争期间，这个剧团跑遍了全军的每一个师，在炮火连天的战场上给战士们演戏，三年中演出四百多场，不但丰富了部队的文化生活，而且鼓舞着指战员们的战斗热情。因此，这些娃娃们受到了指战员们的热爱。解放战争胜利结束后，为了提高他们的业务水平，第三野战军把娃娃剧团交给地方来培养他们。临走前，陈毅司令员还亲自向娃娃们讲话，勉励他们好好学习，说：“部队限于条件，很难提高你们，到地方去，他们会很好地培养你们的。”可是，现在京剧实验学校被彭柏山解散了，他们有的被介绍到别的剧团或学校去，有的却被遣散了，他们遭到了可悲的命运。武工教师黄胜芳，原是娃娃剧团的教师，被遣散后，生活无着，曾一度流落街头。被介绍到杭州大世界去的一些娃娃们，由于没有继续得到教育和培养，有的生活堕落了。彭柏山的这种行为，不但使戏曲事业遭到了无可挽救的损失，也使党和人民政府的威信受到了严重的损害。
    彭柏山到华东文化部后，曾经公开对报社的记者们说：“京剧没有前途，让它自生自灭好了。”记者们向华东局宣传部提出询问：“这句话是否违反中央的政策？”彭柏山的这句话在戏曲界曾引起很大的混乱。
    一九五三年，上海举行了一次美术展览会。参观过这个展览会之后，大家都认为上海的国画家在反映新题材方面是有成就的，是可喜的现象；可是，彭柏山去参观展览会的时候，一进展览会的大门，看见了国画就摇头，一直到走出会场还是摇个不停。一九五四年，华东美术家协会为老画家黄宾虹先生举办了一次山水画展览会，我们请赖少其同志写了一篇评论短文，发表了黄宾虹先生一幅山水画。彭柏山早上看到报纸后，抓住赖少其同志文中的某些缺点，马上打电话到编辑部来严厉指责，说这是“带有方向性的原则性的错误”。在美术工作者中，引起了很大的不满。
    对于民间音乐，彭柏山也是深恶痛绝的。中央音乐学院华东分院在文艺整风以后，努力纠正轻视学习民间音乐的偏向，当他们在对外演出中第一次演唱一些民间音乐节目的时候，彭柏山听过后大为不满，他用命令的口吻对该院一位负责同志说：
  “这些东西（指民间音乐）叫那些艺人去唱好了，你们不要唱！”另一次，彭柏山到音乐学院华东分院去，看到一个有关民间音乐的资料展览会，一走进展览会的门槛，就警告在场的工作人员说：“你们这样搞要注意一个问题！”到底是什么问题呢？在场的工作人员一点也摸不着头脑。于是问他要注意的是什么问题，他吞吞吐吐地说：“你们的问题要好好研究！”最后他在意见簿上似通非通地写道：“民族形式不等于民间音乐”。原来彭柏山要人们注意的不是党的文艺政策，而是胡风的反动的理论！
    人们可以看出：彭柏山因为躲在党内，比胡风有权，他对民族遗产的破坏，不是比胡风还要凶恶吗？
　  压制批评，保护胡风集团
    一九五三年一月，彭柏山写了一篇题为“关于作家下厂下乡的若干问题”的论文。在这篇论文里，彭柏山把文学作品表现党的政策思想和表现人分裂开来，对立起来，以影片“南征北战”为例，大肆攻击。所谓“不能拿战略思想作为主题”，实际上是抽去了文学典型的政治性，取消了创造文学典型中的党性原则，公开反对文艺为政治服务。
    彭柏山这篇存在着严重错误的论文，是在“文艺月报”一九五三年一月号上发表的，但他要“解放日报”转载，要在“文艺月报”出版那天见报。“解放日报”编辑部发现了上面所说的带有原则性的错误，曾打电话向彭柏山提出来，他不但不接受意见，并且横蛮地说：“有错误由我个人负责”。坚持要把他这篇论文发表。
    这篇带有原则性错误的论文在报上发表后，报社编辑部收到了不少读者的反映，指出彭柏山这篇论文中的错误观点。其中有一个读者写了一篇“文艺可以而且应该表现党的政策思想”的论文，驳斥了彭柏山的谬论。编辑部认为这篇文章的论点基本上是正确的，这个问题既然已经有了不同的意见，有必要在报上展开讨论，把问题澄清。于是，就把编辑部的意见连同读者的文章，一并送给彭柏山看。彭柏山却在回信中说：
    转来这篇文章，我已看过。这是目前最流行的一种见解，拿了党的招牌，吓唬一些非党的和年青的作家，这是要不得的。其实他自己又缺乏常识，钻到牛角尖里去，争论是没有结果，也没有意义的。……目前在文艺思想指导上，着重在正面说明问题，不要引导争论，特别是在理论基础还薄弱的情况下，应当如此。
    不能不说明的是：写这篇文章的读者仅仅是一个爱好文学的青年，是你彭柏山拿了党的招牌来吓唬青年呢，还是青年来吓唬你呢？显然，他是利用他在党内的地位，来蛮不讲理地对待青年，来扼杀文艺批评的开展，横蛮霸道地打击读者对他的批评。
    一九五四年八月，“解放日报”编辑部根据上海文艺工作的具体情况，拟订了一个开展文艺批评的计划，准备比较有系统地批判胡风反革命集团分子在上海出版的一些主要著作和刘雪苇的反动文艺思想。可是，当刚刚发表第一篇评胡风分子冀汸的小说“这里没有冬天”的评论后，马上遭到彭柏山的打击。
    报纸是在八月二十九日发表批评“这里没有冬天”的论文的，九月二日，彭柏山就用上海市委宣传部的名义召开了一次所谓“文艺批评问题座谈会”。这种讨论文艺批评的会议，彭柏山在上海工作期间是从来没有召开过的，现在突然召开这样的一个会议，这就已经够使人吟味的了。在会上，彭柏山表面上是要来“领导”开展文艺批评，不敢公开否定这篇评论；但是，却针对着这篇评论，说什么“对小资产阶级在政治上采取什么态度，同在文艺批评上采取什么态度是不能脱节的。苏联没有这个问题。如果拿苏联的文艺尺度来量，是不解决问题的。”难道彭柏山不知道冀汸是什么样的人，宣传的是什么样的思想？却要来指责党报批评冀汸的文章没有分清“界线”哩！
    可是，彭柏山还以为编辑部人员不懂得他的意思，又怕党报继续搞下去，急得耐不住了，过两天，他就亲自“驾临”“解放日报”编辑部（这也是罕见的！）找编辑部的负责同志，发布了明确的“指令”。他说，“解放日报”所发表的批评冀汸“这里没有冬天”的评论，不够全面，没有把这本书的好的一面写出来；还有呢，在发表这篇批评的时候，没有“通过”浙江省委，使他们很被动。因此，他说：以后不要再搞这样的批评了。编辑部的负责同志问：以后怎样开展文艺批评呢？目前开展文艺批评的中心问题何在呢？他说：中心问题是领导思想不统一，目前不可能开展文艺批评。这里很明白：他的“领导思想”怎么可能和我们统一呢？我们要开展对胡风文艺思想的斗争，他自然要出来干涉说“不可能”了。
    一九五四年九月五日和十九日，“解放日报”先后发表了“幌子与替身”和“历史的镜子”两篇文艺杂谈。这两篇文艺杂谈的内容，都是批评新文艺出版社内胡风分子的反动思想和行为的，在“幌子与替身”里，斥责了胡风分子以“公式化、概念化”作幌子，扼杀工农兵的文艺创作和反映重大的政治斗争题材的创作，而偷偷地贩运反动的文艺作品的罪行；在“历史的镜子”里，斥责了胡风分子企图抬出“武训传”的错误来开脱自己的罪责，逃避人们对他们的严正批判。当然，现在看起来这两篇文章对问题的提法是不够尖锐不够深刻的，甚至连他们的名字也还没有点出来。“幌子与替身”在刊出之前没有送给彭柏山看过，他很不高兴，曾因此而责备了解放日报一位作文艺工作的负责同志，说像这样的稿子不应该不给他看就发表了。“历史的镜子”在发表之前送给彭柏山看了，他写了下面这样一段批示：
    这篇稿子，在原则上是没有毛病的。但解决这样一个问题，是一个复杂的思想斗争过程。
　  目前这个出版社，不是整个领导思想上有问题，而是其中若干人有这种小资产阶级思想问题，应在其内部展开思想批评，报纸上的批评，才能起配合作用；如内部没有组织批评，单在报纸上点一下，不发生重大的作用。因为这些人，不是轻轻敲一下，就可以引起警惕，自觉进行检查。因此，发表的作用不大，要发表，也可以。
    在这个“批示”里，我们可以清楚地看到，彭柏山对盘踞在新文艺出版社里的胡风反革命集团分子的罪行，仅仅说成是所谓“小资产阶级思想问题”，而且，就连对这种“思想问题”的一点点批评，也企图用各种借口取消掉。后来“历史的镜子”一文还是登了，他又出来责难。因为他当时窃踞着中共上海市委宣传部长的职位，在他的不断打击和阻难下，大家也就只好不写了，原来对胡风分子进行斗争的一套“文艺杂谈”计划，就这样给他打掉了。
    一九五四年十月初，“解放日报”编辑部又约了一篇批评路翎的反动的短篇小说集“求爱”的论文。编辑部把排好了的小样送给彭柏山看，这次，他再找不到什么借口，干脆用红笔批上两个大字：
  “不发”。
    彭柏山对于这些批评胡风分子的稿件的压制和打击，同胡风分子对党报的反击，是齐头并进的。
  “解放日报”在一九五四年八月二十九日发表批评冀汸的小说“这里没有冬天”的评论，九月五日又发表了两位读者的来信，表示对这个批评的支持之后，编辑部马上收到了冀汸一封别有用心的信，信内说：“你报九月五日发表了读者郑林、吕佩英两位同志对“这里没有冬天”的意见，我想直接与他们通讯讨论，请你们将这两位同志底通讯处告诉我。”在这之后不久，胡风分子之一梅林在同报社的一位同志的简短的谈话中，也说像这样的问题，是出版社内部的问题，在出版社内部解决就行了。这些论调，不正和彭柏山所说的完全一样吗？
    就这样，“解放日报”全套批判胡风集团反动文艺思想的报道计划，全部被彭柏山利用他在党内窃踞的地位加以摧毁了。他没有辜负胡风的重视，他“顶住”了，把上海的胡风分子保护下来了。
　  阴谋洗刷罪责，蒙混过关
    从上面所揭发的一些材料中，人们已经可以清清楚楚地看到，胡风分子彭柏山，长期以来都在执行着胡风的反社会主义纲领，长期以来都是同胡风亲密地“拥抱”在一起的，彭柏山确实如胡风所期待的那样，在华东“顶住”了。可是，当胡风指示他的喽啰们“可以写文章”，“千万不要被动”，企图保存实力，继续潜伏作恶的时候，彭柏山也就急急忙忙地写了一篇所谓“论胡风底现实主义的反马克思主义观点”的文章，要编辑部马上刊出。在文章的一开头，他就抬出了一块挡箭牌，表明自己早就同胡风进行过斗争的，为了说明这个问题，不妨引一段给大家看看：
    远在一九三八年的春天，曹白写了一篇追悼一个阵亡的革命战士的散文，题名“杨可中”。作者最初送给我看，我认为他是用一种小资产阶级伤感的情调抒写革命战士的死，是一篇失败之作。当时我就写了一封简短的信，给作者提了一点意见。……
    上面这封信，我事前既没有准备发表，也没有想到被作为批评的对象。然而不然，这封信一由曹白转到胡风手里，就在“七月”第八期公布了，而且成为胡风斗争的对象。
    在这里，彭柏山实际上是向人们炫耀着：“你看，我早在一九三八年就已经成为胡风的斗争对象了，我彭柏山难道还是胡风反革命集团分子吗？”可是，就在这篇文章里，彭柏山尽管用尽马克思主义的美丽词句，企图掩盖狐狸的尾巴，而这条狐狸尾巴却仍然露出来了，在文章的最后一段，彭柏山替胡风指出：“虚心学习，虚心听取群众的意见，坚决地与自己的错误思想作斗争，仍然有着美好的将来。”彭柏山对胡风的“将来”，描写得多使人神往啊！
    这第一篇文章没有能登出来，彭柏山又急急忙忙地赶写了第二篇“论胡风创作的反马克思主义观点”来，内容空空洞洞，不过是胡风所说的可以
  “批评一下胡某”而已，目的还是为了“千万不要被动”。
    真的，彭柏山在自己的文章发表后，他就“主动”了，在一次有各区区委宣传部理论教育科长参加的会议上，竟恬不知耻地指示到会同志向区委传达他的布置（他要大家认真记录）：“……批判胡风的报告，各区应根据我写的文章去做”。当时，会上有人说他这篇文章驳不倒胡风，彭柏山就直截地说：“这篇文章，基本论点都有了，没有错的。”
    可是，尽管彭柏山再阴险狡猾，在觉醒了的人民面前，在强大的共产党面前，想蒙混过关是不可能的。现在，摆在彭柏山面前的唯一出路，就是彻底坦白，低头认罪，悔过自新，否则就将自绝于人民！
