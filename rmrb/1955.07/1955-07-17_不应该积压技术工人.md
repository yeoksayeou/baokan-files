    Technical Workers Should Not Be Backlogged
    Zuo Fei
    While the nation's construction is developing rapidly, and many enterprises urgently need technical workers, the Qiqihar Railway Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is backlogging a large number of them. In the mechanical workshop of this factory, half of the shaping machine operators often have no work to do and have to be transferred to the lumber workshop to carry wood. Third-grade lathe operator Wei Fengge has been doing odd jobs for a full ten months, from July last year to the end of May this year. Shaping machine apprentice Ma Yulin, who entered the factory in June 1953, has only operated a shaping machine independently for three months since completing his apprenticeship. The rest of the time, he has been carrying wood and doing odd jobs. After repeatedly raising his concerns to the party secretary, workshop director, and labor and wages section chief, he recently returned to the workshop. However, he was not assigned to operate a shaping machine, but was sent to a planing machine as an apprentice. Ma Yulin has been in the factory for two years and has already completed his apprenticeship, and is even looking for a master to sign an apprenticeship contract with. The factory also has a senior technical worker named Ding Wenhuan, whose position is "guerrilla" work section leader. Under the leadership of the "guerrilla" work section leader, there is a team of more than 30 workers, including fourth-grade welder Wang Chunhai and fourth-grade fitter Xia Kecun. The "guerrilla" task of this team is, once again, carrying wood.
    The workers in the lumber workshop, feeling sorry for seeing so many technical workers come to carry wood and do odd jobs for them, said to the leadership: Don't let them do the wood carrying! Hire some temporary workers. The factory leaders replied cleverly: Let them create wealth! Hiring temporary workers costs money. It seems that technical workers can only create wealth by doing odd jobs.
    What's even stranger is that while a large number of technical workers are doing odd jobs, the leadership is still shouting that there are not enough workers, busy recruiting new workers on one hand and refusing to transfer the surplus technical workers out on the other. When half of the shaping machine operators in the mechanical workshop are carrying wood outside, the personnel department sends new workers to the workshop, and the workshop director puts four of them on shaping machines. In this way, fifteen old shaping machine operators are carrying wood outside, while four novices are learning a trade that is already in surplus. When shaping machine operators, riveters, fitters, and welders are all carrying wood, a key construction unit in the local area asks the factory to borrow welders, but the personnel department refuses to lend even one, saying: We don't have enough people! Another factory manages to borrow a few, but they are quickly recalled. After being recalled, they still carry wood, and some are still idle.
    Technical workers are the most valuable asset in national construction. The Qiqihar Railway Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant's backlog of a large number of technical workers is an erroneous act that weakens the nation's technical strength and must be corrected immediately.

    不应该积压技术工人
    左飞
    当国家的建设事业日益发展，许多企业迫切需要技术工人的时候，齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂却积压了大批技术工人。这个厂的机械车间有一半的插床工经常没有工作干，只得调在制材车间去抬木头。三级车工魏凤阁从去年七月到今年五月末干了整整十个月的杂工活。一九五三年六月进厂的插床学徒工马玉林自从出师以后，仅仅单独操作了三个月插床，其余的时间全都在外面抬木头、打零杂。他三番五次向党委书记，车间主任和劳动工资科长提出意见后，最近才回到车间里来。可是回来后也不是去操作插床，又被派到刨床上去当学徒工。马玉林入厂两年来，早已出了师，又在找师傅订师徒合同。厂里还有一个名叫丁文焕的高级技术工人，他担任的职务是“游击”工段长。在“游击”工段长率领下的，是一支包括四级电焊工王春海，四级钳工夏克存等三十多名工人组成的队伍。这支队伍的“游击”任务，不是别的，依然是抬木头。
    制材车间的工人看见这样多技术工人来替他们抬木头，当杂工，心里不忍，就向领导上说：抬木头的活，不要让他们做吧！给些临时工就行了。厂的领导人回答得妙：让他们创造财富吧！雇临时工又得花钱。好像技术工人只有做杂工的活才能创造财富。
    更奇怪的是，就在大批技术工人做杂工活的同时，领导方面还在叫喊工人不够，一面忙着收新工人，一面拒绝把多余的技术工人调出去。机械车间半数插床工在外面抬木头的时候，人事部门又给车间送来新工人，车间主任把其中的四名放在插床上。这样，十五个老插床工在外面抬木头，四个新手又在学已感有余的工种。当插床工、铆工、钳工、电焊工都在抬木头时，当地的一项重点工程施工单位向厂里借电焊工人，人事部门一个也不借，说：我们的人还不够呢？另一个工厂好不容易借去几个，又忙着要回来，要回来后还是抬木头，有的至今仍闲着。
    技术工人是国家建设中最宝贵的财产。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂积压大批技术工人，乃是削弱国家技术力量的错误行为，必须立即纠正。
