　　It is necessary to unite the peasants outside the cooperative with full enthusiasm
　　Jian Hong
In the current mutual aid and cooperation movement, most members of agricultural production cooperatives can take care of, help, and patiently educate peasants outside the cooperative with full enthusiasm and without any estrangement. This gradually integrates them in thought and feeling with the cooperative, creating extremely favorable conditions for the further development of the cooperative. However, a small number of cooperative members with low awareness mistakenly believe that the Party and the People's Government's emphasis on agricultural cooperatives means that agricultural cooperatives enjoy special privileges in rural areas. Therefore, on the one hand, they constantly demand special care from the government, and on the other hand, they behave "arrogantly" and "domineeringly" towards peasants outside the cooperative. These behaviors seriously damage the political prestige of the cooperative and hinder the unity between the cooperative and peasants outside the cooperative.

According to readers' letters: the "public land" and "reserved land" in some districts and villages in Liaoning Province were originally cultivated by mutual aid teams and individual farmers; after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, these lands were unconditionally taken over by the cooperatives for operation; some cooperatives even occupied the land of workers' families. In addition, the cooperatives "monopolized" land reclamation, firewood cutting, transportation, and the distribution of various loans. The agricultural cooperative in Liu'an Village, Tianjin suburb, contracted out many local odd jobs, and poor peasants outside the cooperative, who used to supplement their lives by doing odd jobs, often could not find work now. Most of the various agricultural loans and relief funds distributed to the village were distributed to agricultural cooperatives, and individual farmers received very little, or even none. Some cooperatives also cut down public trees at will and took public property in the village to the cooperative for use. An agricultural cooperative in Yucheng County, Henan Province, moved the desks from the school to the cooperative without the school's consent; when someone raised an objection, the cooperative director said: "Public property can be used by the cooperative, it doesn't matter."

In daily contact, some things done by cooperative members often make peasants outside the cooperative not know whether to laugh or cry. When the carts of the agricultural cooperative in Shangzaoyu Village, Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, met the carts of individual farmers, the cooperative's cart driver shouted from afar: "This is the cart of the agricultural cooperative, quickly give way!" When an individual farmer was delivering manure and the cart could not move, he was very anxious. At this time, the agricultural cooperative's large horse-drawn cart was passing by. The cooperative members sitting in the cart not only did not hurry to help, but clapped their hands and shouted gleefully: "Come and see! Come and see the superiority of individual households!" When some cooperative members were working in the fields, they picked up stones and threw them into the fields of individual households; some cooperative members chopped down the branches of individual farmers' fruit trees for firewood while spraying pesticides on the cooperative's fruit trees. The most serious thing is that some cooperatives arbitrarily infringe on the property of peasants outside the cooperative. In order to concentrate the housing of cooperative members, the Tongli Village Mutual Aid Agricultural Cooperative in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, forced four mutual aid team members and cooperative members to exchange houses. Among them, a backbone member exchanged a dilapidated house worth fifty yuan for a good house worth two hundred yuan belonging to a mutual aid team member. In order to make the land of the cooperative contiguous, the Gong Sheng Cooperative in Litun Village, Gaiping County, forcibly exchanged four mu of good land belonging to individual farmers for four mu of thin sandy land. When some cooperatives in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, reclaimed wasteland, they not only destroyed many private graves, but also occupied a lot of wasteland that had already been reclaimed by individual farmers. This kind of rude and bad behavior emotionally angered peasants outside the cooperative, and directly infringed on the economic interests of peasants outside the cooperative, making peasants outside the cooperative alienated from the cooperative and suspicious of the Party's policies, causing great difficulties for the future development of the collectivization movement.

This kind of privileged thinking and hegemonic behavior is a remnant of the feudal ruling class and is not at all compatible with the principles of socialism. If this kind of thinking dominates in a cooperative, it is impossible to imagine that this cooperative can move forward smoothly on the road of socialism. This kind of thinking will lead agricultural cooperatives to a very dangerous path, not only isolating agricultural cooperatives in rural areas, but also causing the cooperatives to degenerate and collapse. For the further development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to unite the peasants outside the cooperative. People who truly love agricultural cooperatives and love the cause of socialism should never regard agricultural cooperatives as a privileged group of people, but as the core of uniting the broad masses of peasants.

The privileged thinking and the "superior" thinking of some cooperative members are often closely related to the wrong thinking and behavior of local staff. In order to force peasants to join the cooperatives, some local staff deliberately create an atmosphere among the masses, making peasants who do not join the cooperatives feel political, economic, and spiritual pressure. Some staff members see agricultural cooperatives discriminating against peasants outside the cooperative and not only do not dissuade them, but encourage them. The Sixth District Committee of Gaiping County specifically stipulated during this year's spring plowing that peasants outside the cooperative could only rent land to agricultural cooperatives. Seeing that the district committee took such an attitude, some cooperatives planted gourds in people's graves without obtaining the consent of peasants outside the cooperative. Staff members adopt a tiresome and discriminatory attitude towards individual farmers, and agricultural cooperative members will naturally learn from it, and will behave even more seriously. Therefore, in order to strengthen the unity between cooperative members and peasants outside the cooperative, grassroots staff must first change their attitude of discriminating against peasants outside the cooperative, and adopt an attitude of taking care of, helping, and educating peasants outside the cooperative with full enthusiasm and without any estrangement.

### 要满腔热情地团结社外农民

　　要满腔热情地团结社外农民
　　剑虹
    在目前的互助合作运动中，大多数农业生产合作社的社员，都能满腔热情地、没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育社外农民，使他们从思想感情上渐渐和社打成一片，为社的进一步发展创造了极有利的条件。但是，也有少数觉悟不高的社员，把党和人民政府对农业合作社的重视，错认为农业合作社在农村中是享有特权的。因此，他们一方面不断向政府要求特殊的照顾，一方面对社外农民表现得“耀武扬威”“盛气凌人”。这些行为严重地伤害了社的政治威信，妨碍了社和社外农民的团结。
    据读者来信反映：辽宁省有些区、村的“公地”和“机动地”原是互助组和单干农民种的；农业合作社成立后，这些地就被无条件地一律收归社里经营了；有的社甚至把工人家属的土地也占去了。此外，在开山荒、砍柴、拉脚以及各种贷款的分配方面，也都由社“垄断”。天津郊区刘安庄乡农业合作社把当地许多小工都包下了，社外贫困农民过去靠做小工贴补生活的，现在常常找不到活做。发到村里的各种农业贷款和救济款，绝大部分都被农业合作社分去，单干农民分得的很少，甚至没有。还有些社，随便砍伐公有的树木，随便把村里公有的东西拿到社里去使用。河南虞城县有个农业合作社，不经学校的同意，就把学校里的桌子搬到社里用了；别人提出了意见，社长却说：“公家的东西，社里用没有关系。”
    在日常接触中，有些社员干的事情也常常使得社外农民哭笑不得。辽宁盖平县上枣峪村农业合作社的大车和单干农民的大车遇到一起时，社里的赶车的老远就大喊：“这是农业合作社的大车，赶快给我让路！”有一个单干农民送粪时车走不动了，很着急，这时农业合作社的大马车正从旁边经过，坐在车上的社员们不但不赶快帮忙，反而幸灾乐祸地拍手大喊：“来看哪！来看单干户的优越性啊！”有些社员在地里做活时，把石子拣出来，扔到单干户的地里；有些社员一边砍单干农民的果树枝烧火，一边给社里的果树打药。最严重的是有些社任意侵犯社外农民的财产。黑龙江克山县同立村互助农业合作社，为了使社员住得集中，竟强迫四户互助组组员和社员换房子住。其中一个骨干分子，用价值五十元的破房子，换了一个互助组员价值二百元的好房子。盖平县李屯村的公胜社，为了使社里的土地连片，用四亩薄沙地硬换了单干农民的四亩好地。浙江新昌县有的社开荒时，不但破坏了许多私坟，并且侵占了不少单干农民已开出的荒地。这种蛮横的恶劣行为，从情感上激怒了社外农民，而且直接侵犯了社外农民的经济利益，使社外农民对社疏远了，对党的政策怀疑了，给今后合作化运动的发展造成了很大的困难。
    这种特权思想和霸道行为是封建统治阶级的思想残余，和社会主义的原则是丝毫不能相容的。如果这种思想在一个社里占了优势，不可能设想，这个社能在社会主义的道路上顺顺当当地前进。这种思想会把农业合作社引到非常危险的道路上去，不但使农业合作社在农村中孤立起来，而且会使社变质、垮台。为了农业合作社的进一步发展和巩固，必须团结社外农民。真正热爱农业合作社、热爱社会主义事业的人，决不应该把农业合作社看成是一种有特权的人的团体，而要把它作为团结广大农民的核心。
    有些社员有特权思想，“高人一等”的思想，往往是和当地工作人员的错误思想和行为有密切关系的。有些地方工作人员为了迫使农民入社，故意在群众中造成一种空气，使不入社的农民感受到政治上、经济上、精神上的压力。有些工作人员看到农业合作社歧视社外农民，不但不劝止，反而予以鼓励。盖平县第六区区委在今年春耕时特别规定社外农民出租土地只准租给农业合作社。看到区委采取这样的态度，有些社不取得社外农民的同意就硬在人家的坟地里栽种倭瓜。工作人员对单干农民采取厌烦、歧视的态度，农业合作社社员自然就会照着学，而且会表现得更严重。因此，为了加强社员和社外农民的团结，基层工作人员首先要改变歧视社外农民的态度，而采取满腔热情地、没有隔阂地、耐心地照顾、帮助和教育社外农民的态度。
