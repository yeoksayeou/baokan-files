Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 10th (TASS dispatch): According to American news agencies, ten members of the U.S. House of Representatives have written to U.S. President Eisenhower, urging him to "seriously consider" proposals for expanding ties between the United States and the Soviet Union. The letter expresses the hope that Eisenhower will discuss mutual visits between the U.S. and the Soviet Union with Soviet government leaders at the Geneva Four-Power Conference.

The Congressmen pointed out that recent events "indicate a trend towards easing tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union." In this regard, they pointed to the following facts: visits to Moscow by American weightlifters and chess players, the upcoming exchange of agricultural delegations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and the favorable reaction in the United States to recent articles in American newspapers advocating the expansion of U.S.-Soviet ties. The letter stated, "If an agreement can be reached in Geneva to expand these ties and establish regular visits, it would greatly contribute to building mutual understanding and promoting the cause of peace."

    新华社十一日讯　塔斯社纽约十日讯：据美国通讯社报道，美国众议院十个议员写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，要求他“认真考虑”关于扩大美国和苏联之间的联系的主张。信中表示希望艾森豪威尔在日内瓦四大国会议上同苏联政府领导人讨论关于美苏两国之间互相访问的问题。
    议员们指出，最近时期所发生的事件，“说明美苏两国之间的紧张关系趋向缓和”。在这方面，他们指出下列事实：美国举重运动员和象棋选手访问莫斯科，美苏两国即将互派农业代表团，最近时期在美国报纸上出现的主张扩大美苏两国之间联系的文章在美国获得良好反应。信中说，“如果在日内瓦能就扩大这种联系和建立经常性访问达成协议，那末，这在很大程度上将有助于建立互相谅解及促进和平事业。”
