　　Yangtze River Fish Fry Transferred to Heilongjiang Province

　　Heilongjiang Province successfully transferred a large quantity of Yangtze River fish fry from Wuhan. More than 12 million grass carp, black carp, silver carp, and bighead carp fry were transported by train in batches to Jingpo Lake, Xiaoxingkai Lake, and the Lamasi Fish Farm in mid-June.

　　Although this batch of fish fry went through a transportation journey of more than 150 hours and more than 5,000 li, thanks to the continuous water changes and aeration by the transportation personnel, and the strong assistance of the railway and other departments, an average survival rate of over 80% was achieved (the general survival standard is around 50%), creating an unprecedented record for fish fry transportation in our country.

　　Currently, the personnel at each fish farm are carefully raising the fry, and they are growing well. (Wang Xiyuan)

　  长江鱼苗移运黑龙江省
    黑龙江省从武汉市移运大量的长江鱼苗获得成功。一千二百余万尾青、草、鲢、鳙鱼苗，已于六月中旬由火车分批运到镜泊湖、小兴凯湖、喇嘛寺养鱼场。
    这批鱼苗虽经过了一百五十多小时、五千多华里运输路程，但由于运苗人员不断地为鱼苗换水打气，铁路等部门的大力协助下，达到了平均百分之八十以上的成活率（一般成活标准是百分之五十左右），创造了我国运输鱼苗的空前纪录。
    现在各养鱼场人员正在精心饲养，鱼苗生长良好。　（王希元）
