Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 22nd: Shanxi Province has completed the watershed planning for the Fen River, a tributary of the Yellow River. This is the first watershed plan for a Yellow River tributary made from the overall perspective of the Yellow River basin planning, based on the principle of comprehensive utilization.

The Fen River is a major tributary in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. It flows south from Mount Guancen, diagonally across the central and southern parts of Shanxi Province, and flows into the Yellow River between Hejin and Wanrong counties. The Fen River's main stream is 675 kilometers long, with a drainage area of over 39,000 square kilometers. According to the plan, soil and water conservation work will be gradually carried out in an area of 28,000 square kilometers throughout the river basin; seven reservoirs will be built on the main stream and upstream tributaries; shelterbelts of 30 million trees will be planted; scientific water use will be gradually promoted in the irrigated areas; and crop planting areas will be divided according to different soils, rainfall, and climate to develop cash crops and increase crop yields in the irrigated areas. As a result of this comprehensive development, flood disasters in the low-lying areas of the middle reaches and industrial areas such as Taiyuan will be alleviated. The loess and hilly cultivated areas and barren sandy land covering 11,000 square kilometers within the basin will be basically transformed into terraced fields, forests, and pasture slopes after fifteen years, controlling approximately 50 million tons of sediment flowing into the Yellow River from the Fen River each year. The river's waterpower will be gradually developed and utilized, generating more than 73,000 kilowatts of electricity. After fifteen years, the irrigated area of the entire river will expand from more than 3.4 million mu in 1952 to more than 5 million mu, increasing grain production by more than 280 million jin and cotton production by 27.5 million jin compared to now.

As early as 1953, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, in conjunction with relevant departments, dispatched nearly a hundred technicians to conduct surveys in various parts of the Fen River basin, collecting hydrological, topographic, meteorological, geological, and socio-economic data. Over the past few years, the state has invested 790,000 yuan in the planning and surveying of this basin, and has established thirteen hydrological stations and three water level stations along the Fen River to accumulate data, completing this arduous task after one year and eight months.

### 黄河支流汾河的流域规划工作完成

    黄河支流汾河的流域规划工作完成
    新华社太原二十二日电　山西省已经完成了治理黄河支流汾河的流域规划工作。这是从黄河流域规划整体出发，根据综合利用的规划原则作出的第一个黄河支流的流域规划。
    汾河是黄河中游一大支流，自管涔山南流，斜贯山西省中南部，由河津县和万荣县之间流入黄河。汾河干流全长六百七十五公里，流域面积达三万九千多平方公里。按照规划，全河流域二万八千平方公里的面积上，将要逐步进行水土保持工作，在干流和支流上游修筑七座水库；栽植三千万株树木的护田林带；在灌溉区内逐步推行科学地用水，按照不同土壤和雨量、气候划分农作物的种植地区，发展经济作物、提高灌区农作物的产量。这样综合开发的结果，中游低洼地区和太原等工业区的水患将可解除。流域内一万一千平方公里面积的黄土、丘陵耕作区、荒山沙滩，十五年后基本上变成梯田森林和牧草坡地，将使汾河每年流入黄河的约五千万吨泥沙得到控制。全河水力逐步加以开发利用，可发电七万三千多瓩。十五年后全河灌溉面积将由一九五二年的三百四十多万亩扩大到五百多万亩，比现在可增产粮食二亿八千多万斤、棉花二千七百五十万斤。
    山西省水利局早在一九五三年就和有关部门先后联合派出近百个技术人员，在汾河流域各地勘查，搜集水文、地形、气象、地质等资料和社会经济情况。几年来国家曾为这个流域的规划勘查投资七十九万元，并沿汾河设立了十三个水文站和三个水位站积累资料，经过一年八个月完成了这个艰巨的工作。
