    Saving Basic Construction Investment Through Design
    Gao Xuting
    When the central government's instructions on saving investment in basic construction were issued, some staff members in the Design Bureau system of the First Ministry of Machine Building initially had some confused ideas. Some thought: "The projects we are designing now are economical enough, and there is no more room to squeeze. If we want to save investment, we can only reduce the quality of the project." Some thought: "The construction drawings have already been drawn, and to save money, we have to revise the design, which will delay construction. It is impossible to save money and complete the project on schedule." Others said: "It is okay to practice economy now, but in the future, after construction, we will report and reimburse the actual expenses!" In short, it was believed that saving investment in basic construction was very difficult.
    Based on the above-mentioned ideological situation of some staff members, the leaders of the Design Bureau, through the method of detailed accounting, calculated the investment figures that could be reduced from several typical design projects, and proposed the basis for the reduction, and then mobilized and implemented it in the entire bureau system. The Design Bureau first calculated the construction projects of several factories to be constructed in the second half of 1955. Without affecting the construction progress and the quality of the project, the average savings in total construction investment was 7% by using substitute materials, eliminating unnecessary decorations, and modifying the overly high standards of floors and roofs. For the construction of some factories, the standards of non-production projects were also reduced in accordance with the new national regulations, and some small projects unrelated to production were cut down, which can save 10% or even 20% of the total construction investment. It can be seen that it is entirely possible to save basic construction investment from the design. This is more specifically reflected in the following aspects:
    Carefully considering the cooperation between production and related parties is the first aspect of saving in industrial design. For example, the Shanghai Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Motor Factory are only separated by a river, but each designed a set of fire-fighting equipment (including fire trucks, fire-fighting personnel, and fire truck garages). In fact, the farthest journey of the fire truck only takes eight minutes. It is entirely possible for the two factories to use a set of fire-fighting equipment together. After detailed accounting, the original design was modified, saving an investment of 37,000 yuan. The Beijing Automotive Accessories Manufacturing Plant and a certain wire factory both had woodworking workshops in their original designs, but there were state-owned timber processing plants in the locations of both factories. It was entirely possible for these two factories to entrust the local timber processing plants to process the woodwork. Therefore, the woodworking workshops in the original designs were cancelled, saving a total investment of 2.08 million yuan for the two factories.
    Whether it is a new, expansion, or reconstruction project, paying attention to fully utilizing existing buildings and equipment is the second aspect of saving funds in industrial design. The fourth factory building of the Shenyang Transformer Factory that had already been built originally had a very empty layout in the workshop, but the designers always felt that this factory building could not meet the production requirements, and redesigned a crane with a lifting capacity of 100 tons and a fifth factory building with a span of 30 meters. After the designers carefully calculated according to the opinions of Soviet experts, they found that the fourth factory building could fully meet the requirements of the production tasks, and there was no need to build the fifth factory building, which saved an investment of 4 million yuan. When utilizing existing buildings and equipment, attention should be paid not only to large projects, but also to small projects. The transportation design of Shenyang 3302 Factory made by the Third Design Branch originally utilized the existing railway tracks in the factory area as follows: 70% of the standard gauge track was utilized, 35% of the narrow gauge track was utilized, and the oil sleepers were not planned to be utilized. After this re-evaluation, it was determined that 95% of the original standard gauge track could be utilized, more than 80% of the narrow gauge track could be utilized, and most of the oil sleepers could also be utilized. In total, an investment of 136,000 yuan was saved.
    Using inexpensive materials and using substitutes as much as possible is the third aspect of saving funds in industrial design. In the factory buildings designed by the Design Bureau system, many workshops that originally had wooden block floors were changed to cement floors or asphalt concrete floors, saving an investment of 7 to 9 yuan per square meter. Changing steel windows to wooden windows can reduce the cost by one-half. Some factory buildings that originally had metal fences or clear water brick fences were changed to precast cement panel fences or bamboo fences, which can reduce the cost by a lot. Some factory buildings also changed the originally designed steel roof trusses to reinforced concrete roof trusses, which saved a lot of funds.
    Greatly reducing non-production projects and lowering the standards of non-production projects is the fourth aspect of saving funds in industrial design. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the leading personnel and engineering technicians of the Fourth Design Branch of the Design Bureau squeezed the originally designed 1,700 square meter canteen of a certain electric meter factory into the office building, reduced the originally designed ten cars in the factory to seven, and combined the originally designed fire truck garage with the car garage, which saved an investment of more than 100,000 yuan. The standard living rooms initially drafted by the Design Bureau were appropriately lowered according to Soviet standards, and the areas of changing rooms, showers, toilets, etc. were reduced, and some unnecessary decorations were cancelled, which can save 13% compared to the original investment. According to the central government's instructions on lowering the standards of civil buildings, the Design Bureau formulated different standard designs for civil buildings according to the construction sequence of each construction unit and the climate and building materials of the construction site. Now, the standard dormitory designed for the Fulaerji area is: a two-story building, costing 48.9 yuan per square meter (including electric lighting), which is about one-half lower than the original unit cost. For example, the greening, fountains, staff schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and elementary schools for children in the originally designed factory area and worker village can be reduced as much as possible, and cancelled as much as possible, which also saves the state a huge amount of funds.
    Carefully reviewing whether the process, public utility, transportation and other equipment designs are reasonable is the fifth aspect of saving in industrial design. The tool workshop of the Shanghai Tool Factory designed by the Second Design Branch of the Design Bureau originally used an excessively large labor correction coefficient. After detailed accounting by the designers and checking with the indicators of similar workshops in similar factories, the correction coefficient was changed from 1.5 to 1.25, which can reduce the number of production equipment by twelve units, saving an investment of 173,000 yuan. The electric furnace ventilation hood originally designed for the steel casting workshop of the Shanghai Turbine Factory was changed to an exhaust fan, which not only saved an investment of 13,000 yuan, but also saved 90,000 kWh of electricity per year.
    Grasping the design review and modification of projects that are about to be constructed or have begun construction, without affecting the progress and quality of the project, is the sixth aspect of saving funds in industrial design. The four projects of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory designed by the Fourth Design Branch of the Design Bureau, including the office building, the central laboratory, and the technical training class, have already entered the construction stage, but after the designers, the factory, and the construction unit jointly negotiated, it was determined to cancel 31 unnecessary projects, such as the brick-cut drooping ridge on the roof, the indoor and outdoor false balconies, the flower iron railings, the stepping steps, the cement seat lights, and the external plastering. For some projects, the indoor double-layer steel wire mesh wall was changed to a single-layer gray board wall, the wooden window sill plate was changed to cement plastering, and the terrazzo plastering sewage pool was changed to cement plastering. In total, the factory saved an average of 11.4% compared to the original investment in the projects constructed in the second half of 1955. According to the calculations of the four design branches of the Design Bureau, an investment of 3.3 million yuan can still be saved in the projects constructed in the second half of 1955.
    Strengthening budget work and economic analysis is the seventh aspect of saving funds in industrial design. At present, the design budgets of the Design Bureau system of the First Ministry of Machine Building generally have poor quality and a lot of waste. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, it will affect the state's control of funds. For example, the preliminary estimate of the 6106 factory designed abroad, compiled by the First Design Branch, over-listed 13 million yuan in independent expenses alone, which was removed during the review by the higher-level authorities. Economic analysis is the best way to measure investment savings in industrial design. In industrial design, only through economic analysis can more funds be saved more rationally. For example, after comparing the preliminary design of the Wuhan Boiler Factory with another boiler factory designed abroad, it was found that the utilization rates of expensive equipment such as hydraulic presses and winches in the steam drum workshops of the two factories were very low. Therefore, it was determined to only consider building one steam drum workshop in the short term. At the same time, it was analyzed that the process adopted by the foreign-designed factory was relatively advanced and was also built first. Therefore, it was decided that the steam drum workshop of the Wuhan Boiler Factory could be delayed. In this way, not only can existing equipment be utilized, but also an investment of 6 million yuan can be saved.
    The above facts prove that in industrial basic construction, it is entirely possible to save investment from the design. The key lies in mobilizing all employees, especially engineering and technical personnel, to truly establish confidence and a sense of responsibility for saving funds for the country. For example, a ball bearing factory provided the design department with information on "universally training all workers in the factory for two years," and the design department did not carefully analyze whether all workers need to be trained for two years, and adopted it. Later, after careful study by the design department and relevant units, the proportion of trained workers was slightly reduced, saving 2 million yuan. For example, when the Shanghai Turbine Factory prepared the design of the preparation workshop, the factory requested to install an additional vertical lathe. The designer designed it according to the factory's opinions. After this detailed accounting, it was considered that this vertical lathe was not needed at all, and therefore it was cancelled, saving an investment of 80,000 yuan. It is worth noting that most of the investment savings at present are still starting from changing the unreasonable aspects of past designs. If we want to further save funds on the basis of certain quota standards, we must vigorously mobilize all engineering and technical personnel to find tricks and tap potential, so that the design can be technologically advanced and economically reasonable. Recently, after the design branches mobilized engineering and technical personnel to tap the potential for savings, some advanced saving methods have emerged. For example, the railway special line designed by the Fourth Design Branch originally designed each meter of steel rail to weigh 43 kilograms according to the standard. After the designers calculated the weight of the vehicles passing on the special line, it was enough for each meter of steel rail to weigh 38 kilograms. In this way, 10 kilograms of steel rail can be saved for each meter of railway line (calculated according to two rails). All of these illustrate that there are many aspects in industrial design that can be saved.

    从设计当中节约基本建设投资
    高煦亭
    当中央关于在基本建设中节约投资的指示下达以后，在第一机械工业部设计总局系统的某些工作人员中，最初还有一些糊涂思想。有的认为：现在设计的项目已经够节约的了，再也挤不出什么油水来了，如果还要节约投资，只有降低工程质量。有的认为：施工图纸已经绘好了，要节约就要重新修改设计，重新修改设计就要延期施工；又要节约，又要按期完工是不可能的。还有的说：现在厉行节约是可以的，将来施工后，花多花少再实报实销吧！总之，认为在基本建设中节约投资是很困难的。
    设计总局领导上根据某些工作人员的上述思想情况，通过算细账的办法，从几个典型设计项目中算出可以缩减的投资数字，提出可以缩减的根据，然后再在全局系统中进行动员和贯彻。设计总局首先算了一九五五年下半年施工的几个工厂的建筑项目，在不影响施工进度，不影响工程质量的条件下，从利用代用材料、取消不必要的装饰、修改标准过高的地坪和屋顶等，平均节省了建筑总投资百分之七。对某些工厂建筑，也根据国家新规定降低了非生产项目的标准，削减了一些同生产无关的小项目，即可以节省建筑总投资百分之十甚至百分之二十。由此可见，从设计当中节约基本建设投资是完全可能的。这更具体表现在以下几个方面：
    认真考虑生产上和有关方面的协作，是工业设计中节约的第一个方面。例如，上海汽轮机厂和上海电机厂只隔着一条河，也各自设计了一套消防设备（包括消防车、消防人员和消防车库）。其实消防车的最远行程只需要走八分钟，两厂共同采用
  一套消防设备是完全可以的，经过算细账，修改了原来的设计，节省投资三万七千元。北京汽车附件制造厂和某电线厂，原设计中都有木工车间，但两厂所在地都有国营木材加工厂，这两个厂将木活委托当地木材加工厂加工是完全可能的，因此取消了原设计中的木工车间，两个厂共计节省投资二百零八万元。
    不管是新建、扩建、改建工程，注意充分利用原有建筑和设备，是工业设计中节约资金的第二个方面。沈阳变压器厂已建的第四厂房本来车间里布置的很空，但设计人员总认为这个厂房不能适应生产要求，又重设计了一个起重能力一百吨的吊车和跨度三十公尺的第五厂房。经过设计人员根据苏联专家意见仔细计算之后，发现第四厂房完全能够满足生产任务的要求，不需要再建第五厂房，这就节省了四百万元投资。利用原有的建筑和设备，不仅要注意大项目，也要重视小项目。第三设计分局作的沈阳三三零二厂的运输设计，原来对厂区原有铁轨利用的情况是：标准宽轨利用了百分之七十，窄轨利用了百分之三十五，油枕木是不准备利用的。经过这次重新鉴定，确定原有标准宽轨可以利用到百分之九十五，窄轨可以利用到百分之八十以上，油枕木也可以大部利用。总计起来，节省投资十三万六千元。
    采用廉价的材料和尽量使用代用品，是工业设计节约资金的第三个方面。设计总局系统设计的工厂建筑，把不少车间原设计的木块地面改为水泥地面或沥青混凝土地面，每平方公尺就节省投资七元至九元。把钢窗改为木窗，可减少造价二分之一。有的厂房把原来设计的金属围墙或清水砖围墙，改为水泥预制板围墙或竹篱，造价就可减低不少。还有的厂房把原设计的钢屋架改为钢筋混凝土屋架等，都节省了不少资金。
    大大削减非生产项目，降低非生产项目标准，是工业设计中节约资金的第四个方面。设计总局第四设计分局的领导人员和工程技术人员在苏联专家帮助下，把某电表厂原设计的一千七百平方公尺的食堂挤在办公楼里，把原来设计的厂内十辆汽车减少为七辆，把原设计的消防车库同汽车库合并，即节约投资十几万元。设计总局初步拟订的标准生活间，根据苏联标准适当地加以降低，将更衣室、淋浴室、厕所等面积加以缩小，取消一些不必要的装饰等，就可以比原来投资节省百分之十三。设计总局根据中央降低民用建筑标准的指示精神，按照各建筑单位的施工先后，按照建筑所在地的气候及建筑材料等特点，分别制定了不同的民用建筑的标准设计。现在，设计的富拉尔基地区的标准宿舍是：两层楼房，每平方公尺造价为四十八元九角（包括电照在内），较原设计的单位造价降低了二分之一左右。再如原设计的厂区和工人村的绿化、喷水池、职工学校、幼儿园、托儿所、子弟小学等，可以缩减的尽量缩减，可以取消的尽可能取消，也给国家节省了巨额资金。
    认真审核工艺、公用、运输等设备设计得是否合理，是工业设计节约的第五个方面。设计总局第二设计分局设计的上海工具厂工具车间，原来采用的劳动量修正系数过大，设计人员经过算细账，并同类似厂的类似车间的指标加以核对，把修正系数从一点五改为一点二五，就可以减少生产设备十二台，节省投资十七万三千元。上海汽轮机厂铸钢车间原来设计的电炉通风罩，改用排气风扇，不但节省投资一万三千元，每年还可节省电力九万度。
    在不影响工程进度和工程质量的条件下，抓紧对将要施工或开始施工的项目的设计进行审查和修改，是工业设计节约资金的第六个方面。设计总局第四设计分局设计的哈尔滨电机厂的办公大楼、中央试验室、技工训练班等四项工程，虽已进入施工阶段，但经设计人员同厂方、施工单位共同协商，确定将屋顶的砖切垂脊，室内外的假阳台、花铁栅、踏步台阶、水泥座灯、外粉刷等三十一项不必要的工程取消；有些项目将室内的双层钢丝网板墙改为单层灰板墙，木窗盘板改抹水泥，水磨石抹面污水池改抹水泥等。总计，这个厂在一九五五年下半年施工项目中，平均较原投资节省了百分之十一点四。按设计总局所属四个设计分局的计算，一九五五年下半年施工的项目，还可以节省投资三百三十万元。
    加强预算工作和经济分析，是工业设计节约资金的第七个方面。目前，第一机械工业部设计总局系统的设计预算，普遍有质量不高，浪费很大的现象，这种现象如不消除，就会影响到国家对资金的控制。如第一设计分局编制的国外设计的六一零六厂的概算，只独立费用部分就多列了一千三百万元，经过上级机关审查时，才予以去掉。经济分析，是衡量工业设计撙节投资的一个最好方法，在工业设计中，也只有通过经济分析，才能更合理地更多地节约出资金来。如武汉锅炉厂初步设计，同国外设计的另一锅炉厂进行经济比较后，发现两厂汽包车间水压机，卷扬机等贵重设备利用率都很低，于是确定在短时期内只考虑建设一个汽包车间；同时，又分析了国外设计厂所采用的工艺决定较为先进，也建设在先，故决定武汉锅炉厂的汽包车间可以缓建。这样一来，不但使现有设备得以利用，并可节省投资六百万元。
    上述事实证明，在工业基本建设中，从设计上节约投资是完全可能的，其关键在于发动全体职工，特别是工程技术人员，使他们真正树立起为国家节省资金的信心和责任感。如一个滚珠轴承厂向设计部门提供了一项将“全厂所有工人普遍培训两年”的资料，设计部门也未认真分析所有工人是否都要培训两年，就加以采用。后来，经过设计部门同有关单位仔细研究，培训工人的比例稍加缩减，就节省了二百万元。再如：上海汽轮机厂准备车间设计时，厂方要求多安装一台立式车床，设计人即按厂方意见设计了，经过这次算细账以后，认为这台立式车床根本不需要，因而取消了，就节省投资八万元。值得注意的是目前节约的投资，绝大部分还是从改变过去设计的不合理方面着手的，如果想从一定的定额标准的基础上，进一步节约出资金来，则还要大力发动全体工程技术人员找窍门，挖潜力，才能使设计达到技术上先进，经济上合理。最近，各设计分局经过发动工程技术人员挖掘节约潜力以后，已出现了一些先进的节约方法。如第四设计分局设计的铁路专用线，原来按照标准设计每一公尺钢轨重四十三公斤，经过设计人员根据专用线上经过的车辆重量计算，每一公尺钢轨重三十八公斤就够了。这样每一公尺铁路线就可节省十公斤钢轨（按二根轨计算）。所有这些，都说明了工业设计中可以节约的方面是很多的。
