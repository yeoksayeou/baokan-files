Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 2nd (TASS dispatch)

    As previously reported, U.S. President Eisenhower made a statement at a press conference held in Washington on June 29th. In answering questions from reporters, the President expressed his views on several aspects of U.S. foreign policy and spoke about the prospects for the upcoming summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Naturally, these remarks have attracted the attention of public opinion concerned with the success of this meeting.

    In his speech on June 21st, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, already pointed out that the Soviet government agreed to participate in the four-power summit meeting based on the premise that the purpose of this meeting would be to ease international tensions and strengthen trust in international relations. The head of the Soviet government said, "We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal, and we hope that the other participating countries in this meeting will also strive to do so."

    The Soviet public welcomes with satisfaction Eisenhower's words expressing the necessity to ease international tensions in order to ensure world peace. The U.S. President said that, in his view, the upcoming four-power summit meeting would help to discover "paths leading to new approaches to problems and will eventually find ways to ease tensions." Although, as President Eisenhower himself said, "not expecting too much" from the meeting, he believes that "if some ways can be found to alleviate the burden of fear and tension on people, we should explore these ways to the maximum extent."

    The Soviet public welcomes Eisenhower's statement that "peaceful rather than provocative methods should be adopted" and that the slogan of the "Cold War" should be abandoned. The Soviet people hope to believe that President Eisenhower's proposal to replace the slogan of the "Cold War" with the slogan of "fighting for peace" is not a rhetorical formula, but a genuine desire to strive for an end to the notorious "Cold War," because only in this way can international tensions be eased, can the necessary trust in international relations be established, and can the threat of a new war be eliminated.

    The Soviet people have always believed that countries with different social systems can and must achieve peaceful coexistence based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. There is no reason to say that countries with different political, social, or economic systems cannot cooperate on the basis of these principles, if they do not interfere in each other's internal affairs and do not impose their own way of life on the other party.

    From this point of view, Eisenhower's remarks about ending the "Cold War" and "leading problems to new approaches," and adopting "peaceful rather than provocative methods" create a certain prerequisite for improving international relations and easing tensions. However, it would be wrong to ignore other remarks made by the U.S. President at this press conference that run counter to these reasonable goals. We are referring first of all to his deliberately distorted and incorrect remarks about some countries he calls "Soviet satellites." Eisenhower did not consider it necessary to specify which countries he was referring to, but from the rhetoric of the reactionary American newspapers, it can be seen that this refers to the European People's Democracies – countries that have forever abolished capitalist enslavement.

    Mr. Eisenhower believes that he can openly repeat the fabricated slanders of the "Cold War" advocates, as if these countries cannot "freely decide their own political systems," and he clearly implies that the United States intends to continue to try to change the existing political and social systems in the People's Democracies, although life experience convincingly proves that this attempt will be fruitless.

    Needless to say, President Eisenhower and everyone else who is afraid to face the facts know very well that the European People's Democracies freely decided their own political systems more than a decade ago after abolishing the capitalist system. The people of these countries are building a new life according to the socialist orientation. The relationships between the People's Democracies and between them and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and many capitalist countries are built on the basis of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty.

    The leaders of the United States may like or dislike the political and social systems of the People's Democracies, just as the people of the socialist camp may like or dislike the American system. But, as Mr. Eisenhower himself correctly pointed out, "provocation" should be avoided in remarks on these issues, and in any case, they must be based on real facts.

    What do these facts show?

    The system of the People's Democracies is fundamentally different from the system of countries that live on dollars and are trapped in the net of servile dependence on American monopoly capital. In the People's Democracies, the public ownership of the means of production is absolutely dominant. There is no system of exploitation of man by man here, and social production is subordinate to the task of maximizing the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of all the people. The regime in these countries truly belongs to the people, and the people are closely united around their freely elected government, which represents the fundamental interests of all working people. In these countries, no one can change the system by means such as those used in Guatemala. In these countries, it is impossible to have interference in elections such as that which occurs in dependent countries. It is impossible to force them to prohibit trade with whomever they want by external force. The People's Democracies have more than once solemnly responded to the attempts of the imperialist forces to interfere in their internal affairs.

    It is precisely because of this that some people in the United States do not like the existing system in the People's Democracies. It is precisely because of this that they spend millions of dollars to wage the "Cold War" against Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic, just as they do against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Just two days before Mr. Eisenhower held his press conference, the Hoover Commission, responsible for reorganizing the U.S. administrative institutions, issued a report calling for the U.S. intelligence agencies to maximally intensify espionage activities against peace-loving countries. The report said, "The main objective is to concentrate greater efforts on collecting intelligence from our main targets – Russia and its satellites, as well as Communist China."

    In an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Democracies, the United States has also repeatedly exhausted all means to obstruct Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania from entering the United Nations, although the foreign and domestic policies of these countries have always followed the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter, unlike certain puppet regimes described as "democratic" models by U.S. representatives.

    Whether Eisenhower intended it or not, his remarks about the People's Democracies can be seen as an encouragement to the policy of interfering in the internal affairs of these countries from the outside. Such remarks run counter to his correct and valuable suggestions to abandon the "Cold War" and "adopt peaceful rather than provocative methods."

    At the present stage of international relations, there are practical conditions to ease international tensions and establish the necessary trust between countries, in favor of ensuring peace and the security of all peoples. The conscience of the peoples of all countries demands that these conditions be used to free mankind from the fear of the "Cold War." Everything done by countries and their leaders to achieve this lofty goal has always been warmly supported by the peoples of all countries. Conversely, everything done to continue to implement the policy of "strength" and the "Cold War," which has proved to be completely bankrupt, has been resolutely rejected by the peoples of all countries.

    It should not be forgotten that the determination of the peoples of all countries to safeguard and consolidate the cause of peace is now firmer than ever before.

　　评艾森豪威尔总统在记者招待会上的谈话
　　——苏联“真理报”七月二日社论
    前已报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔六月二十九日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上发表谈话。总统在回答记者们的问题时，就美国外交政策方面的若干问题发表了意见，并且谈到了即将举行的苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议的前景。自然，这些谈话引起关心这次会议成功的舆论的重视。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁在六月二十一日的讲话中已经指出，苏联政府同意参加四国政府首脑会议的出发点是：这次会议的目的将是缓和国际紧张局势和巩固国际关系中的信任。苏联政府首脑说，“我们将竭尽一切力量达到这个目的，并且希望这个会议的其他参加国也努力这样做。”
    苏联公众满意地欢迎艾森豪威尔所说的表示必须缓和国际紧张局势以保证世界和平的一些话。美国总统说，据他看来，即将举行的四国政府首脑会议会有助于发现“把问题导向新门径的道路，并且最后将找出和缓紧张局势的方法”。虽然照艾森豪威尔总统自己所说的，对会议并“不作太多的期望”，但是他认为，“如果能够找到一些办法使人们消除恐惧和紧张的负担的话，我们应该对这些办法作最大限度的探讨。”
    苏联公众欢迎艾森豪威尔的这种说法：“应该采取和平的、而不是挑衅的办法”，并且应当抛弃“冷战”这一口号。苏联人民希望可以相信，艾森豪威尔总统提出的关于用“为和平而战”这一口号来代替“冷战”这个口号的建议，不是一种修辞的公式，而是真正为了要争取结束臭名远扬的“冷战”，因为只有这样才能使国际紧张局势和缓下来，才能建立国际关系中的必要的信任和消除新战争的威胁。
    苏联人民过去和现在都认为，社会制度不同的国家是可以而且必须在互相尊重领土和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政和平等互利这些原则的基础上求得和平共处的。没有理由说政治、社会或者经济制度不同的国家不能够在这些原则的基础上进行合作，如果互不干涉内政和不把自己的生活方式强加于另一方的话。
    从这个观点来看，艾森豪威尔所说的必须结束“冷战”和“把问题导向新门径”，采取“和平的、而不是挑衅的办法”这些话为改善国际关系和和缓紧张局势创造了某种前提。但是，如果忽视美国总统在这次记者招待会上所说的、同这些合乎道理的目标背道而驰的其他的话，那就不对了。我们所指的首先是他对他称之为“苏联附庸国”的一些国家所发表的一些故意歪曲的、不正确的言论。艾森豪威尔认为不需要具体说明，他所指的是那些国家，但是，从美国反动报纸的言论中可以看出，这是指的欧洲人民民主国家——永远废除了资本主义奴役的国家。
    艾森豪威尔先生认为可以公开重复“冷战”鼓吹者的那套捏造的谰调，似乎这些国家不能“自由地决定自己的政体”，他并且清楚地暗示，美国打算继续设法改变人民民主国家中现存的政治和社会制度，虽然生活经验十分令人信服地证明，这种企图是不会有结果的。
    不用说，艾森豪威尔总统和一切害怕正视事实的人很清楚地知道，欧洲人民民主国家在十多年前废除资本主义制度以后，就自由地决定了它们自己的政体。这些国家的人民正在根据社会主义的方针建设着新生活。人民民主国家的相互关系以及它们同苏联、中华人民共和国以及同许多资本主义国家的关系是建筑在平等和互相尊重主权的基础上的。
    美国的领导者可以喜欢也可以不喜欢人民民主国家的政治和社会制度，正如社会主义阵营的人民可以喜欢也可以不喜欢美国的制度一样。但是，正如艾森豪威尔先生自己正确地指出的，在关于这些问题的言论中应当避免“挑衅”，并且无论如何必须根据真正的事实。
    这些事实说明了什么呢？
    人民民主国家的制度同依靠美元过活的、陷在对美国垄断资本的奴役性依赖的罗网中的国家的制度有着根本的不同。在人民民主国家中，生产资料的公共所有制是占绝对的统治地位的。这里没有人对人的剥削的制度，而社会生产是服从于最大限度满足全体人民不断增长的物质和文化需要的任务的。这些国家的政权是真正属于人民的，而人民紧密地团结在他们自由选举出来的、代表全体劳动人民的根本利益的政府的周围。在这些国家里，谁都不能够用例如像在危地马拉所用过的手段来改变制度。在这些国家里，不可能有像在附属国发生的、干涉选举的行为。想用外力强迫禁止它们同谁贸易是不可能的。人民民主国家已经不止一次庄严地回答了帝国主义势力干涉它们内政的企图。
    正因为这样，在美国有些人不喜欢人民民主国家现有的制度。正因为这样，他们才花费千百万美元来进行“冷战”，来反对波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国，正像反对苏联和中华人民共和国一样。仅仅在艾森豪威尔先生举行记者招待会两天之前，负责改组美国行政机构的胡佛委员会发表了一份报告，要求美国情报机关最大限度地加紧对爱好和平的国家的间谍活动。这份报告说，“主要的目的是集中更大的力量从我们的主要目标——俄国和它的附庸国，以及共产党中国——收集情报。”
    为了企图干涉人民民主国家的内政，美国同时不止一次地用尽各种手段阻挠匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚进入联合国，虽然这些国家的外交政策和国内政策一向遵循联合国宪章的崇高原则，而是不同于被美国代表描述为“民主”模型的某些傀儡政权的。
    不管艾森豪威尔是否存心这样，他关于人民民主国家的言论可以被看做是对从外部来干涉这些国家内政的政策的鼓励。这样的言论是同他的那些放弃“冷战”和“采取和平的、而不是挑衅的办法”的正确的和有价值的建议背道而驰的。
    在国际关系的现阶段，有着实际的条件来和缓国际紧张局势，建立各国之间的必要的信任，以有利于保障和平和各国人民的安全。各国人民的良心要求利用这些条件，使人类摆脱对“冷战”的恐惧。各国和各国的领导者为了达到这一崇高的目的所做的一切，一直都受到各国人民的热烈支持。相反地，为了继续执行已经证明完全破产了的“实力地位”和“冷战”政策所做的一切，受到了各国人民的坚决唾弃。
    现在各国人民维护和巩固和平事业的决心比以往任何时候更加坚定，关于这一点是不应当忘记的。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二日电）
