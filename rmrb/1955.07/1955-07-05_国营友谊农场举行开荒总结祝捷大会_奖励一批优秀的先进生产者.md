　　State-owned Friendship Farm Holds Summary and Victory Celebration Meeting for Land Reclamation
　　Rewarding a Group of Outstanding Advanced Producers
    The State-owned Friendship Farm held a summary and victory celebration meeting for land reclamation in Xinglong Town one day, rewarding a group of outstanding advanced producers.
    From May 2nd to June 29th, the entire farm reclaimed 22,893 hectares of wasteland. In excellently overfulfilling this task, many tractor drivers, farm implement operators, agricultural workers, truck drivers, repair shop workers, and cooks were selected as land reclamation models and advanced producers. Fourteen land reclamation models, ten advanced tractor contract groups, and sixty-one advanced producers were rewarded at the farm's land reclamation victory celebration meeting.
    The No. 59 "ДТ-54" type tractor advanced contract group was the most noticed group in the entire farm. This contract group has consistently been the holder of the mobile red banner in the land reclamation competition within the team. They reclaimed a total of 327 hectares of wasteland, averaging 4.747 hectares per shift, exceeding the work quota by 35.6%. The quality of work all met the requirements. This contract group also actively helped three other locomotive contract groups. At the same time, they saved 1,693 jin of fuel in land reclamation. The leader of the contract group, Long Enze, was named a land reclamation model, and the farm implement operator, Yang Fu, was selected as an advanced producer.
    The leader of the No. 93 "ДТ-54" type tractor advanced contract group, Li Yonghai, was also a land reclamation model himself. He not only led the entire group to complete the land reclamation task, but also often used his spare time to scrub the floors of the camp car, maintain public hygiene, and went to the blacksmith shop to collect some broken small plowshares, modify some simple parts, and bring them back to the team for everyone to use. He not only helped the locomotives of his own team, but also helped the locomotives of neighboring production teams overcome difficulties. During the land reclamation period, the No. 93 locomotive did not lose any parts of agricultural machinery. Li Yonghai also humbly learned from Soviet experts and other tractor drivers in his work to improve his work efficiency.
    Wu Xuekong (Communist Party member), who was selected as a land reclamation model, is a gas station attendant in the Fifth Production Team. In order to avoid wasting time in refueling and maintaining the locomotives, Wu Xuekong prepared and arranged the fuel oil, engine oil, and lubricating oil in advance for both the morning and evening shifts, so that the locomotives could carry out maintenance in an orderly manner when taking over the shift. The location of the tractor operation sometimes moved to a very far place, and large vehicles could not deliver the oil in time, so he carried dozens of jin of oil to the operation site to supply the locomotive needs in time. During the land reclamation period, Wu Xuekong also collected the waste oil used for tractor maintenance and sent it back to the oil depot. He recovered about 600 kilograms of waste oil, which could still be used after treatment.
    Xu Delu, the cook of the Eleventh Production Team, was selected as an advanced producer. Xu Delu tried to improve the food in the team and made more than ten different kinds of pasta, which was praised by everyone. At the same time, he also often kept the supply of boiling water in the kitchen sufficient. Xu Delu paid great attention to saving food. He always cooked according to the number of people; he collected the rice crust from the pot and used warm water to soak it and cook porridge.
    Wang Caoli, Director of the Farm, Liu Baoqing, Head of the Working Committee of the State-owned Friendship Farm of the Chinese Communist Party, and Nikolenko, Chief Consultant of the Farm Director, all spoke at the meeting, congratulating the model workers and all employees.

　　国营友谊农场举行开荒总结祝捷大会
　　奖励一批优秀的先进生产者
    国营友谊农场一日在兴隆镇举行了开荒总结祝捷大会，奖励一批优秀的先进生产者。
    从五月二日到六月二十九日，全农场开垦了两万两千八百九十三公顷荒地。在出色地超额完成这一工作任务中，许多拖拉机手、农具手、农业工人、汽车司机、修配厂工人、炊事员被评选为开荒模范和先进生产者。十四名开荒模范、十个拖拉机先进包车组和六十一名先进生产者在农场的开荒祝捷大会上受到了奖励。
    第五十九号“ДТ五十四”式拖拉机先进包车组是全场最受人注意的包车组。这个包车组一直是队内开荒竞赛的流动红旗保持者。他们总共开垦了三百二十七公顷荒地，平均每个班次开荒四点七四七公顷，超过工作定额百分之三十五点六强。作业质量都合乎要求。这个包车组还积极帮助了另外的三个机车包车组。同时他们还在开荒中节省了一千六百九十三斤油料。包车组组长龙恩泽被评为开荒模范，农具手杨富被选为先进生产者。
    第九十三号“ДТ五十四”式拖拉机先进包车组组长李永海本人也是开荒模范。他不仅领导全组完成了开荒任务，经常利用自己休息的时间，擦洗宿营车的地板，保持公共卫生，还到铁匠炉去收拾好一些打坏了的小犁铲，改制一些简单零件，带回队部供大家使用。他不仅帮助本队的机车工作，而且也帮助邻近的生产队的机车克服困难。在开荒期间，第九十三号机车没有丢失农机具任何零件。李永海在工作中还虚心地向苏联专家和其他的拖拉机手学习，提高自己的工作效率。
    当选为开荒模范的吴学孔（共产党员）是第五生产队的加油员。为了避免机车加油、保养中浪费时间，吴学孔每天早、晚班都事先把燃料油、机油、滑润油装好摆齐，使机车接班时可以有秩序地进行保养。拖拉机作业的地点有时移动到很远的地方，大车不能把油及时送到，他就挑着几十斤油到作业地去及时供应机车需要。在开荒期间，吴学孔还把拖拉机保养使用过的废油回收起来送回油库，大约一共回收了六百公斤废油，这些废油经过处理后，仍然可以使用。
    第十一生产队的炊事员徐德禄被评选为先进生产者。徐德禄想方法改善队内的伙食，并做出十多种不同的面食来，得到大家的称赞，同时他还经常保持厨房内的开水充分供应。徐德禄非常注意节约粮食，他总是按着人数做饭；把饭锅巴收拾起来，用温水泡了煮粥。
    农场场长王操犁、中共国营友谊农场工作委员会负责人刘宝庆、农场场长总顾问尼科连科都在大会上讲了话，他们向模范工作者和全体职工祝贺。　（新华社）
