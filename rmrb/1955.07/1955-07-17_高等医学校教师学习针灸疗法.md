Higher Medical School Teachers Study Acupuncture Therapy

The National Higher Medical School Acupuncture Teacher Training Class opened in Beijing on the 4th. This training class is organized by the Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health. There are more than twenty students participating in the training class. They are professors, lecturers, attending physicians, and teaching assistants from twenty-three higher medical schools across the country.

During the six-month study period, students will study the Communist Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, the existing theories and practical operation methods of acupuncture therapy, and courses such as the history of Chinese medicine. The training class will also invite experts to lecture on advanced Soviet medicine and the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners related to acupuncture theory. After the study, the students will return to their units to teach and further research this therapy. (Xinhua News Agency)
