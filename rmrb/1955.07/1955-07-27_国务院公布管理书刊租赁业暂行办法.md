Xinhua News Agency, July 24th -- The State Council promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Book and Magazine Rental Industry on July 20th. The measures stipulate: Those engaged in the business of renting books and magazines, whether specializing or concurrently operating (including book and magazine distributors concurrently engaging in rentals or book and magazine rental businesses concurrently engaging in distribution), regardless of whether they have obtained a business license, should prepare a business application, stating the fundraising methods, business scope, equipment conditions, location of shops or stalls or mobile operations in the local area, the name and resume of the person in charge, and apply to the local cultural administrative organ for approval or re-application for approval to operate. After the cultural administrative organ approves and issues a business license, they should register with the local industrial and commercial administrative organ with the license and obtain a business license.

The measures point out: Book and magazine rental operators should rent and distribute proper books and magazines and pictures that are beneficial to the people's physical and mental health, and shall not rent or distribute books and magazines and pictures that violate the Constitution and laws and decrees of the People's Republic of China, as well as other books and magazines and pictures that the government explicitly prohibits. If book and magazine rental operators need to change their trademark, change industry, merge, suspend business, close down, change the person in charge of the business, business scope, business location or area, they should report to the cultural administrative organ and the industrial and commercial administrative organ for approval separately. Those who violate the above two regulations shall be given warnings, have part or all of their books, magazines and pictures confiscated, or be ordered to suspend business by the local people's committee or autonomous organ depending on the circumstances; or have their business license revoked, and their business license revoked by the local industrial and commercial administrative organ. If the circumstances are serious, the local people's court shall punish them according to law.

The measures point out: The people's committees of various provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the autonomous organs of autonomous regions may formulate supplementary measures based on these measures and the specific conditions of the local area.

The measures state: The implementation of the above measures is to ensure the circulation of proper and beneficial books and pictures; to improve the people's cultural life, protect the physical and intellectual development of young people, teenagers, and children, and maintain social public order. The book and magazine rental industry referred to in the measures refers to shops and vendors engaged in the business of renting newspapers, periodicals, books, albums, and pictures.
