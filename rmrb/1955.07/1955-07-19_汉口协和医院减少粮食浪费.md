Hankou Xiehe Hospital has saved more than 1,000 jin of grain each month for the past three months. Their methods for saving grain have attracted the attention of hospitals in Wuhan.

In the past, the staff at Hankou Xiehe Hospital who managed patient meals believed that wasting food in the hospital was unavoidable, and there was a serious phenomenon of food waste in the wards. Previously, when the hospital workers distributed rice and noodles to patients, they would always add a large bowl regardless of whether the patient could finish it. When distributing steamed buns, they would routinely give each patient four. If a patient finished one bowl and wanted a little more, they would still get a large bowl. In the end, when collecting the bowls, whatever was not eaten would be thrown away, resulting in a great deal of waste.

In March, all employees of Hankou Xiehe Hospital studied ways to save grain. At the same time, they conducted a key inspection of the management of patient meals and studied ways to improve it. They established a new meal service system for the wards. The workers paid attention to the patient's appetite when serving food, "adding less," "running more," and "not being afraid of trouble," adding only as much as the patient wanted to eat. The hospital's doctors and nurses also paid attention to the patient's changing condition and appetite at all times, and coordinated with the "nutrition room," which prepared meals for patients, and the food delivery staff to ensure that no grain was wasted.

When preparing meals, the "nutrition room" strengthened planning, estimating the amount of rice needed based on the actual number of patients and their appetites. At the same time, they changed the 3-liang steamed buns to 2-liang small steamed buns, basically eliminating the past phenomenon of many patients eating half and discarding the other half.

    汉口协和医院减少粮食浪费
    汉口协和医院最近三个月来每月节约粮食一千多斤。他们节约粮食的办法引起武汉市各医院注意。
    汉口协和医院管理病人伙食的工作人员过去认为医院中浪费粮食是不可避免的，病房里一直存在着严重的浪费粮食的现象。过去医院工友们给病人分饭、分面时不管病人是否吃得下，总是添上一大碗，分馒头时也照例每个病人分上四个。如果病人吃完一碗想再添一点，也照样再来一大碗。到了最后收碗的时候，吃不完就倒掉，浪费很大。
    三月份，汉口协和医院的全体职工进行了节约粮食的学习，同时对病人的伙食管理工作进行了重点检查，研究了改进办法；建立了新的病房开饭制度，工友们都注意掌握病人食量，给病人添饭时
  “少添”、“多跑”、“不怕麻烦”，病人要吃多少就添多少。这个医院的医师、护士也随时注意病人的病情变化和食欲好坏，同专为病人做饭的“营养室”以及送饭的人员联系好，做到不浪费粮食。
  “营养室”做饭时，加强计划性，根据实有病人人数和食量下米；同时将三两重一个的馒头改为二两重的小馒头，基本上消灭了过去很多病人吃半个丢半个的浪费现象。　（新华社）
