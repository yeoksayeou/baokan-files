Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: The International Commission for Cambodia has submitted its second interim report to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Recently, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom have distributed this report to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

The report describes the work of the International Commission for Cambodia during the three months from January 1 to March 31, 1955.

The report mentions that regarding the issue of former resistance members participating in national life and democratic rights, officials of some local authorities in the Kingdom government adopted an overly hasty attitude and created various difficulties for former resistance members, which prevented the situation from easing. In order to ensure that local authorities and former resistance members correctly understood the government's policy, the Kingdom government, at the request of the Commission, issued a statement on January 14 explaining the procedures for applying to participate in national life and clarifying the call to conduct normal free political activities within the scope of the constitution after participating in national life.

The report mentions that the Commission continues to receive complaints from former resistance members or their families protesting the Kingdom government's illegal detention of former resistance members and the extortion of money, violation of personal freedom, and creation of difficulties for former resistance members and their families by local authorities. The Commission has investigated such complaints and has requested the Kingdom government and local authorities to handle them promptly.

The report mentions that the Commission investigated the Kingdom government's complaints that former resistance members had not participated in national life and were still engaged in anti-government propaganda and secret armed activities. The results of the investigation could not substantiate the charges made by the Kingdom government.

The report mentions that the Kingdom government submitted several lists of prisoners of war to be released. However, these lists contained duplications. At the same time, due to the laxity of Cambodian military organization, inconsistent spelling of names, and the use of aliases, it was difficult to identify them. Moreover, the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had informed the Commission that the Vietnamese side was not currently detaining any of the people on the lists. The Commission informed the Kingdom government of this situation.

The report mentions that the King of Cambodia submitted a reform plan to the International Commission on February 19 to amend the election system. According to this plan, only residents who have resided in the electoral district for more than three years have the right to participate in elections. The International Commission believes that while it has no intention of interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs, it has a responsibility to review whether this election reform plan complies with the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the participation of all Cambodian citizens in elections. The report points out that the commissioners suspect that some aspects of this plan may be inconsistent with the international obligations undertaken by the Kingdom government.

The report mentions that normal relations existed between the Commission and the Kingdom government. However, these relations were forced to be interrupted due to the former King's intention to hold a referendum on the constitutional reform plan and his abdication. During this period, some foreign newspapers repeatedly condemned the Commission for opposing the King's reforms and making incorrect and irresponsible attacks blaming it for Sihanouk's abdication. The Commission believes that this was to undermine the credibility of the International Commission and create the impression that the relationship between the Kingdom government and the Commission was becoming strained. To this end, the Commission issued a communiqué stating that the Commission maintained normal relations with the Kingdom government. Currently, the Commission has shaken off these attacks and has good reason to believe that normal relations between the Kingdom government and the Commission will be restored.

### 柬埔寨国际委员会提出第二次临时报告

    柬埔寨国际委员会提出第二次临时报告
    新华社二十五日讯　柬埔寨国际委员会向日内瓦会议主席国——苏联和英国提出了第二次临时报告。最近，苏、英两国政府已将此报告分送给日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告叙述了从一九五五年一月一日到三月三十一日三个月来柬埔寨国际委员会的工作情况。
    报告提到，关于前抗战人员参加国家共同生活和民主权利问题，王国政府部分地方当局的官员对前抗战人员采取过急态度和种种刁难，以致使情况未能缓和。为了使各地方当局和前抗战人员正确了解政府的政策，王国政府在委员会的要求下，已于一月十四日发出关于说明获取参加国家生活的申请书的手续和阐明参加国家生活后能进行在宪法范围内的正常的自由政治活动的号召。
    报告提到，委员会仍继续收到前抗战人员或其家属抗议王国政府非法监禁前抗战人员和地方当局勒索钱财、侵犯人身自由、刁难前抗战人员及其家属的控诉书。委员会对该类控诉书已进行了调查，并且已要求王国政府和地方当局迅予处理。
    报告提到，委员会对王国政府提出的关于前抗战人员未参加国家生活、仍在进行反政府宣传和秘密武装活动的申诉书进行了调查。调查的结果不能证实王国政府所提出的罪名。
    报告提到，王国政府提出若干要求释放的被拘战俘人员。但这些名单前后重复。同时，由于柬埔寨军事组织松懈，名字拼法不一，有的采用别名，因此很难辨认。而且越南民主共和国当局曾告诉委员会称，越方现在并没有拘禁名单中的任何一个人。委员会将此情况通知了王国政府。
    报告提到柬埔寨国王二月十九日曾向国际委员会提出修改选举制度的改革计划。按照这一计划，只有在选举区内定居三年以上的居民，才有参加选举的权利。国际委员会认为：它虽然无意干涉柬埔寨的内政，但是它有责任审查这一选举改革计划是否符合于日内瓦协议中关于柬埔寨全体公民均能参加选举的规定。报告指出，委员会各委员怀疑此一计划的某些方面可能与王国政府所承担的国际义务有不符之处。
    报告提到，委员会与王国政府之间曾存在着正常的关系。但是，由于前任国王拟对宪法改革计划举行民意测验及他的退位，此种关系被迫间断。在这期间，某些外国报纸曾多次谴责委员会反对国王的改革应对西哈努克退位负责的不正确与不负责任的攻击。委员会认为，这是为了破坏国际委员会的威信和造成王国政府和委员会之间的关系趋于紧张的印象。为此，委员会发表了一项关于表明委员会与王国政府间经常保持着正常关系的公报。目前，委员会已摆脱此种攻击，并且有充分理由相信，王国政府和委员会之间的正常关系将能得到恢复。
