　　Unreasonable Regulations Should Be Revised
　　The Railway System's Abusive Free Ticket System. Editor:
    While ensuring railway transportation costs and implementing new fares, it is unreasonable for the Ministry of Railways to still maintain the system where employees and their families enjoy twelve free train tickets per year (railway employees in Northeast China have four free tickets per year, each allowing four people to travel together).
    For a long time, because railway employees and their families have the right to travel for free, it often leads to crowded passenger transport (this situation is especially obvious during the New Year and other holidays), and passengers who are eager to travel cannot buy tickets, which has become a frequent problem. Do railway employees and their families need to travel so frequently? The actual situation is that many workers try every means to use the twelve free tickets they get each year. For example, railway staff working in the Bengbu area often take their spouses and children to Nanjing to visit Xuanwu Lake on Saturday afternoons, taking advantage of their Sunday off. Another example is a certain engineer who used to work in the Ministry of Railways, who used his free tickets to take his entire family to visit West Lake during the New Year last year. Similar examples are too numerous to mention.
    In some areas, it has also been discovered that railway employees and their families use free tickets to transport private goods for sale. For example, Feng Zhanshan and Li Zongchun, family members of employees at Siping Station, transported hundreds of kilograms of beef from Siping to Shenyang for sale in October last year. Zhong Qi's wife, from the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, used free tickets to travel between Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang to sell Atractylodes macrocephala (a valuable medicinal material). In addition, some people give away their unused free tickets to relatives and friends, or even sell them, creating a very bad influence. We believe that if the Ministry of Railways changes this system of a huge number of free tickets, it can not only eliminate the above abuses, but also reduce transportation costs and increase national income. Why doesn't the Ministry of Railways change this unreasonable system when adjusting passenger and freight rates? Yuan Zhifan Editor:
    For a long time, I have believed that the system where railway system employees and their families enjoy twelve free tickets per year is something that should be reformed.
    Here, let me use a practical example to illustrate the unreasonableness of this regulation. In May of this year, I went on a business trip to Shanghai and met my uncle (whose daughter works in the Wuhan Railway Bureau) who came to Shanghai from Wuhan to play. He said that this time, starting from Wuhan, because of free travel, he detoured through Changsha, Zhuzhou, Nanchang, Shangrao, Hangzhou, and other places to reach Shanghai. I think if my uncle's daughter did not work in the railway department, then he would definitely go directly from Hankou along the Yangtze River to Shanghai. Obviously, this unreasonable free ticket system is causing a huge waste of national transportation capacity.
    I believe that the railway system's free ticket system has many unreasonable aspects, and this system must be changed quickly to reduce transportation costs. Xu Wenbao
　　Low-Priced Supply of Unused Household Coal Editor:
    The Fuxin Mining Bureau has a system of supplying employees with household coal at low prices. This system stipulates that each employee can buy 600 jin of coal per month during normal times and 1,000 jin of coal per month during the heating season; the price is 4.6 or 4.7 yuan per ton. Because the amount of coal supplied is too large, and the price is less than a quarter of the market price, many problems have arisen. Some employees' families waste coal when burning it, burning whole pieces of coal and throwing away the remaining coal dust; large piles of ownerless coal dust have appeared near some workers' residential areas, such as Ping'an and Wulong, and some nearby residents use carts to haul it back to make coal bricks for burning. Some employees also resell the coal they don't use, which has a very bad impact.
    The waste caused by this system is quite huge. If the Fuxin Mining Bureau reduces the supply of household coal to employees by one-third (which is still quite generous compared to the amount of coal used by ordinary residents), the entire mine can supply the market with tens of thousands of tons of coal more per month. If the coal price is set more reasonably, the state can earn tens of thousands of yuan more per month.
    It is worth noting that many coal mines in the Northeast have similar systems. In order to practice thrift, I suggest that the Ministry of Fuel Industry quickly study this issue and change this unreasonable system.
                                        Tie Heyi
　　"Travel Allowances" That Do Not Consider Actual Needs Editor:
    Many staff members of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are stationed in certain factories in Jilin, and they can receive 18 yuan of travel allowance per month. However, some staff members have been working outside for a long time, some even with their families, and they actually do not need travel allowance subsidies. Because the travel allowance can be collected every six months or a year, some staff members, after receiving hundreds of yuan of travel allowance, eat and drink lavishly, squandering and wasting, creating a bad influence.
      The Design Institute has about 3,000 staff members, and more than a quarter are often working outside, so the monthly expenditure on travel allowances is considerable, and obviously a portion of it should not be spent.
      It is understood that similar situations also exist in other agencies. I believe that the current travel allowance system needs to be reasonably revised to plug such loopholes and save expenses for the country.

### 应该修订这些不合理的制度

　　应该修订这些不合理的制度
　　流弊多端的铁路系统免票制度编辑同志：
    在保证铁路运输成本而实行新运价的时候，铁道部仍然保留职工及其家属每年享受十二张免费乘车票的制度（东北地区铁路职工每年有四张免票，每张可同行四人）是不合理的。
    长期以来，由于铁路职工及其家属享有免费乘车的权利，往往形成了客运拥挤（这种情况在过年过节时尤为明显），而急于旅行的乘客买不到车票，已经成为经常性的问题了。铁路职工及其家属是否需要作如此频繁的旅行呢？实际情况是许多工人因为每年有十二张免费车票，就想尽一切办法加以利用。例如，在蚌埠地区工作的铁路人员往往利用星期天休假机会，在星期六下午带着自己的爱人和孩子到南京逛玄武湖；又如前在铁道部工作的某工程师去年过年时就利用免票携带了一家老小去游西湖。类似这种例子真是举不胜举。
    在某地区还发现铁路职工和他们的家属，利用免票到处贩运私货。例如四平车站职工家属冯占山、李宗春等人在去年十月份从四平贩运牛肉数百斤到沈阳出售。柳州铁路管理局钟奇的爱人利用免票在广西、陕西、浙江间来往贩卖白术（一种名贵药材）。另外还有人把自己用不完的免费车票赠送给亲友，甚至出卖，造成了很不好的影响。我们认为如果铁道部改变了这个数量巨大的免票制度，不仅可以消除上述流弊，还可以减低运输成本增加国家收入，为什么铁道部在调整客货运价的时候不改变这种不合理制度呢？　　渊芷凡编辑同志：
    长期以来，我对铁路系统职工和家属每年享受十二张免票，一直认为是一件应该改革的事情。
    这里，让我用一个实际的事例来说明这项规定的不合理吧。今年五月间我出差到上海，遇到我的舅父（他的女儿在武汉铁路局工作）从武汉到上海来玩。他说这次由武汉出发，因免费乘车，所以绕道经过长沙、株州、南昌、上饶、杭州等地而到上海。我想如果我舅父的女儿不在铁道部门工作，那末他一定会从汉口顺长江直达上海。很明显，这种不合理的免票制度是造成了国家运输力的巨大浪费。
    我认为铁道系统的免票制度有着很多不合理的地方，必须迅速改变这个制度，降低运输成本。徐文宝
　　低价供应用不完的生活用煤编辑同志：
    阜新矿务局有一项低价供应职工生活用煤的制度。这项制度规定：每个职工平时每月可以买煤六百市斤，采暖季节每月可以买煤一千市斤；价格是每公吨四元六、七角。由于供煤数量过多，而价格还不到市价的四分之一，因此出了很多弊病。有些职工家属烧煤时随便浪费，成块的煤拿来烧了，剩下的煤末扔掉了；像平安、五龙等几个工人住宅区附近已经出现了大堆无主的煤末，附近有些居民就用大车拉回去制煤砖烧。还有一些职工把用不完的煤转卖出去，影响很不好。
    这项制度所造成的浪费是相当巨大的。如果阜新矿务局把职工生活用煤的供应量减少三分之一（这和一般居民用煤量比较还是相当宽裕的），全矿每月就可多出上万公吨的煤供应市场需要。煤价如果规定得合理一些，国家每月就可以多收入数十万元。
    值得注意的是，东北很多煤矿都有类似的制度。为了厉行节约，我建议燃料工业部迅速研究这个问题，改变这种不合理的制度。

　　不考虑实际需要的“出差费”编辑同志：
    重工业部有色冶金设计院很多工作人员驻在吉林某些工厂工作，他们每月都可以领取十八元出差费。但是，有些工作人员几年来长期在外工作，有的甚至家庭也在一起，实际上不需要出差费的补贴。由于出差费可以半年或一年一并领取，有些工作人员领到了上百元的出差费后就大吃大喝，挥霍浪费，造成了不好的影响。
      设计院工作人员共三千人左右，经常在外的有四分之一以上，因此每月支出的出差费就很可观，而里面显然有一部分是不应该支出的。
      据了解，类似情况在其它机关也有。我认为，现在的出差费制度有必要加以合理的修订，以堵塞这样的漏洞，为国家节省开支。
