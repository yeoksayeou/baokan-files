    Stop US Conspiracy Activities in Laos

    After instigating the Royal Lao Government to launch armed attacks on the Lao Fighting Units, the United States is now conspiring to incite the Manila Treaty military bloc to directly invade Laos. Just as people are eagerly anticipating that the four-power government summit will make due contributions to easing international tensions, the US government is carrying out this conspiracy to seriously threaten peace in Indochina and the Far East. This cannot but arouse people's high vigilance.

    The current armed conflict in Laos is a direct result of the US conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords in Laos. As early as March of this year, after the Manila Treaty aggressive organization held a meeting in Bangkok, US Secretary of State Dulles publicly slandered the Lao Fighting Units, which were gathered in the two provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua in accordance with the Geneva Accords, as elements engaged in "subversive activities", clamoring that the Royal Lao Government should freely carry out "suppression" under the "protection of the Manila Treaty." Since January of this year, the US government has been continuously providing funds and military equipment directly to the Royal Lao Government. Recently, the United States has also publicly clamored that it will sign a so-called "military aid agreement" with the Royal Lao Government to "support" the Lao Royal Army in "suppressing" the Lao Fighting Units. It was under these circumstances that, from June to early July of this year, the Royal Lao Government launched new military offensives against the Lao Fighting Units, occupying many places southeast of Muong Phoun in Sam Neua province within the Lao Fighting Units' assembly area. However, the United States is even attempting to portray the armed conflict it single-handedly created as an attack by the Lao side on the Royal Government, and has instructed Thailand to request a meeting of the Manila Treaty Organization to "study the situation in Laos." The Thai government has also clamored that it has ordered the Thai army to "make preparations." The United States is clearly attempting to realize its long-standing conspiracy by this means - to launch a direct invasion of Laos by the Manila Treaty military bloc.

    The results of the 1954 Geneva Conference halted hostilities in Laos, stipulated that the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua in Laos would be assembly areas for the Lao resistance forces, and determined the path to resolving Lao political issues through universal suffrage participated in by all Lao citizens. Article 14 of the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos stipulates: "Pending a political settlement, the Lao fighting units assembled in temporary garrison areas shall, with the exception of combatants who wish to be restored to their homes where they would be able to resume their normal life, be transferred to the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua." The Lao Fighting Units faithfully implemented this clause, concentrating their forces, which were originally distributed throughout Laos and had liberated half of Lao territory, completely in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces as scheduled, pending the resolution of Laos' national political issues. The Lao parties also issued a joint statement at the political conference on January 18 this year, stating that it was necessary to implement the Geneva Accords and resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, "in order to jointly consolidate peace, bring freedom and democracy to the people, and achieve unity..." However, the US government openly described the Lao Fighting Units as elements engaged in "subversive activities" in the two provinces, instigating the Royal Government to take military measures, disrupting political consultations between the two sides, and reigniting armed conflict in Laos. This in itself is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. The United States' supply of military equipment to the Royal Lao Government in order to launch armed attacks on the Lao Fighting Units, and its attempt to sign a military agreement with the Royal Government, directly violate the Geneva Accords regarding Laos' non-acceptance of foreign military aid. The US conspiracy to incite the Manila Treaty military bloc to directly invade Laos, if not stopped, will completely tear up the Geneva Accords and reignite the war in Indochina.

    The International Commission, which is responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, sent a letter to both parties on June 15 this year, suggesting that both parties immediately resume political conferences "and will make every effort to continue negotiations until a political solution is reached." This is in line with the Geneva Accords, and this is the only legitimate way to solve various problems in Laos. Recently, the International Commission has further requested both parties to immediately cease all hostilities. The Lao Fighting Units not only expressed their full agreement with the International Commission's proposal of June 15 a long time ago, but also issued a statement again on July 10, demanding that the Lao authorities stop military offensives against the Lao Fighting Units, demanding sincere negotiations based on the principle of mutual concession between the two sides, and demanding the organization of free and universal elections with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units. However, under the instigation and instigation of the United States, the Royal Lao Government has not yet agreed to stop armed offensives and restore political consultations, but instead has mobilized a large number of troops to prepare for a larger-scale offensive against the Lao Fighting Units.

    People remember that during the Asian-African Conference, Lao Royal Prime Minister Kat Sasorith held talks with Vietnamese Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, and the joint statement issued after the talks mentioned that the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units should seek a political solution based on the Geneva Accords. People also remember that the Lao King announced on February 14 this year that the Kingdom of Laos was willing to "establish friendly and peaceful relations with its surrounding countries" in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to "establish small peaceful areas within the vast peaceful area that some Asian countries are striving to establish." This is completely in line with the interests of the Lao people, and this is precisely the provision of the Geneva Accords. People have reason to demand that the Royal Lao Government abide by its own promises, and in accordance with the International Commission's recommendations, immediately stop armed offensives and resume political conferences between the Lao parties. People believe that as long as foreign interference is eliminated in the future, the Lao people are fully capable of solving their own problems and realizing the unity of all citizens. However, if the Royal Lao Government listens to the instigation of the United States and continues to launch armed offensives against the Lao Fighting Units, willingly becoming a tool in the US launching the Manila Treaty military bloc for aggression, then Laos will not only not become a peaceful area, but will become a base for the US to reignite the Indochina War and threaten the peace of the entire Far East.

    China is one of the participating countries in the Geneva Conference. China and Laos are neighboring countries bordering each other. The Chinese people will never allow the US conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords in Laos to succeed. All participating countries of the Geneva Conference and all peace-loving countries that safeguard the Geneva Accords have a responsibility to stop all US conspiracies against Laos, so that Laos can become an independent, unified, democratic, and peaceful country in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

### 制止美国在老挝的阴谋活动

    制止美国在老挝的阴谋活动
    美国在老挝唆使王国政府武装进攻寮国战斗部队后，现在更阴谋策动马尼拉条约军事集团对老挝直接进行侵略。正当人们殷切期待四国政府首脑会议将对和缓国际紧张局势作出应有的贡献时，美国政府却进行着这种严重威胁印度支那和远东和平的阴谋活动，这就不能不引起人们的高度警惕。
    当前老挝的武装冲突是美国在老挝破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动的直接结果。早在今年三月，马尼拉条约侵略性组织在曼谷举行会议后，美国国务卿杜勒斯就曾经公开把按照日内瓦协议集结在丰沙里和桑怒两省的寮国战斗部队诬蔑为进行“颠覆活动”的分子，叫嚣老挝王国政府应该在“马尼拉条约的保护”下放手进行“镇压”。自今年一月起，美国政府就不断向老挝王国政府直接提供款项和军事装备。最近，美国还公开扬言将同老挝王国政府签订所谓“军事援助协定”，“支援”老挝王国军队对寮国战斗部队的“镇压”。正是在这种情况下，今年六月份到七月初，老挝王国政府向寮国战斗部队发动了新的军事进攻，侵占了寮国战斗部队集结区内桑怒省芒奔东南的许多地方。然而，美国竟还企图把它所一手造成的武装冲突说成是寮国方面向王国政府的进攻，并指使泰国要求召开马尼拉条约组织的会议“研究老挝的局势”。泰国政府并且扬言，已经命令泰国陆军“进行准备”。美国显然企图以此来实现它早已存有的阴谋——发动马尼拉条约军事集团对老挝的直接侵略。
    一九五四年日内瓦会议的结果停止了老挝境内的敌对行动，规定老挝境内丰沙里和桑怒两省为寮国抗战部队的集结区，并确定了通过老挝全体公民所参加的普选解决老挝政治问题的途径。日内瓦会议关于老挝停止敌对行动的协定第十四条规定：“在等待政治解决期间，集合于临时驻扎地段的寮国各战斗单位，除愿意就地复原之战斗人员外，应转移至丰沙里和桑怒两省。”寮国战斗部队忠实地执行了这一条款，把它原来分布在老挝各地、解放了老挝一半领土的队伍，如期地完全集中到丰沙里和桑怒两省，以待老挝全国政治问题的解决。老挝双方在今年一月十八日的政治会议上也曾发表联合声明，表示有必要实施日内瓦协议，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，“以便共同来巩固和平，给人民带来自由和民主，实现统一……。”但是，美国政府却公然把寮国战斗部队说成是在两省进行“颠覆活动”的分子，唆使王国政府采取军事措施，破坏双方间的政治协商，重新挑起了老挝境内的武装冲突。这本身就是严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。美国以军事装备供应老挝王国政府以便向寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻，并企图同王国政府签订军事协定，这更直接违反了日内瓦协议关于老挝不接受外国军事援助的协定。美国策动马尼拉条约军事集团对老挝直接进行侵略的阴谋，如果不加制止，更将彻底撕毁日内瓦协议，重新挑起印度支那的战火。
    在老挝负有责任监察和监督日内瓦协议的实施的国际委员会，在今年六月十五日曾致函双方，建议双方立即恢复政治会议，“并将作一切努力来继续进行谈判，一直到达成政治解决办法时为止。”这是符合于日内瓦协议的，这也是解决老挝各项问题的唯一正当途径。最近，国际委员会更向双方要求立即停止一切敌对行动。寮国战斗部队不仅早已对国际委员会六月十五日的建议表示完全同意，而且在七月十日再次发表声明，要求老挝当局停止对寮国战斗部队的军事进攻，要求按照双方互让的原则举行诚意的谈判，并要求组织有寮国战斗部队参加的自由普选。但是，在美国的唆使和挑拨下，老挝王国政府至今还没有同意停止武装进攻和恢复政治协商，反而调集大批军队准备向寮国战斗部队发动更大规模的进攻。
    人们记得，在亚非会议期间，老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯曾经同越南民主共和国副总理范文同进行会谈，会谈后所发表的联合声明中曾经提到老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队应该根据日内瓦协议谋求政治解决。人们也还记得，老挝国王今年二月十四日还曾宣布：老挝王国愿意根据和平共处的五项原则“和它周围的国家建立友好和和平的关系”，并“在某些亚洲国家正在努力建立的广大和平地区的内部建立小块和平的地区”。这是完全符合老挝人民的利益的，这也正是日内瓦协议的规定。人们有理由要求老挝王国政府遵守自己的诺言，按照国际委员会的建议，立即停止武装进攻，恢复老挝双方的政治会议。人们相信，今后只要排除外力的干涉，老挝人民是完全能够自己解决自己的问题，实现全国公民的团结的。但是，如果老挝王国政府听信美国的唆使，继续武装进攻寮国战斗部队，甘愿成为美国发动马尼拉条约军事集团进行侵略中的工具，那末，老挝就不但不能成为和平地区，而且会成为美国重新挑起印度支那战争和威胁整个远东和平的根据地。
    中国是日内瓦会议的参加国之一。中国和老挝是互相接壤的邻国，两国之间有着共同的边界。中国人民决不容许美国在老挝破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动得逞。所有日内瓦会议的与会国家和一切维护日内瓦协议的爱好和平的国家，都有责任制止美国对于老挝的一切阴谋活动，使老挝能够遵循日内瓦协议的规定成为一个独立、统一、民主、和平的国家。
