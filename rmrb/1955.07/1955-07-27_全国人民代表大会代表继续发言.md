Xinhua News Agency, July 26th—The Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued today. National People's Congress deputies and heads of departments of state organs spoke successively on the main items on the agenda of this session.

    Today, the following 25 people spoke at the meeting: Rong Yiren, Jiang Guangnai, Saifudin, Peng Zemin, Luo Longji, Huaer Gongcheng Lie, Huang Shaohong, Lu Dingyi, Fu Zuoyi, Long Yun, Huang Yanpei, Liang Xi, Chen Qiyou, Guo Menghe, Qian Ying, Huang Jing, Cai Tingkai, Wang Yilun, Wang Renzhong, Xu Jie, Le Songsheng, Tao Lujia, Gu Dacun, Wang Guoxing, and Wazha Muji.

    Deputy Rong Yiren said in his speech that he must accept the socialist transformation of his enterprises and himself under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the working masses, improve business management, practice thrift, oppose waste, and produce high-quality products to meet the needs of the people; at the same time, he will pay taxes according to the law, purchase public bonds, and invest in the interior to support construction. In the future, industrialists and businessmen must tell the truth and do honest work, and actively accept transformation. At the same time, they must be clear-headed, increase vigilance, and assist the government in thoroughly eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    Jiang Guangnai, Minister of the Textile Industry, said in his speech that from the perspective of the textile industry, the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry in the draft of the First Five-Year Plan is completely correct. When considering the development speed of the textile industry in the Five-Year Plan, the original higher targets were appropriately compressed to take into account both the needs of the people's lives and the possibility of raw material supply, and to comply with the state's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Therefore, the development speed set for the textile industry in the Five-Year Plan is appropriate. Jiang Guangnai pointed out that in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the textile industry, in addition to increasing production as much as possible in agriculture, the textile industry department has a major responsibility. On the one hand, it is necessary to save raw materials as much as possible, and on the other hand, it is necessary to find ways to open up new resources, study the use of various available fibers, and study various alternative raw materials. In addition to appropriately meeting the people's growing needs for textiles, the textile industry also has the important task of accumulating funds for the country in the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously oppose waste and establish a strict system of thrift. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political work among all enterprise management personnel, establish economic accounting thinking and a meticulous style, and further improve the level of enterprise management.

    Saifudin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, described in his speech the achievements that Xinjiang Province has achieved during the period of national economic recovery and the goals that will be achieved during the period of national economic development in the First Five-Year Plan. He said that the tasks of Xinjiang Province in implementing the First Five-Year Plan are: focusing on vigorously developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, while rectifying and improving existing industrial and mining enterprises, establishing new industries that can balance local supply, production, and sales, developing transportation and postal and telecommunications services, developing state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in a planned manner, expanding the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, developing trade with the Soviet Union, gradually implementing socialist transformation of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and ensuring that the proportion of the socialist economy in the entire national economy increases year by year, so as to appropriately meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people of all ethnic groups. Saifudin said: The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang eagerly hope that the railway will be opened to Xinjiang soon. They will definitely be able to do all the preparatory work to welcome the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and create the conditions necessary for large-scale economic construction to begin in Xinjiang after the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

    Deputy Peng Zemin described in his speech the efforts of farmers in Guangdong Province to fight drought under the leadership of the Party and the government, as he saw during his inspection work. He said: Judging from the drought resistance situation this time, he deeply felt the correctness and importance of the plan for the transformation and development of agriculture in the First Five-Year Plan. He said that the publicity and education of the general line and the experience of this drought resistance profoundly educated the farmers, making them feel that the backward small-scale peasant economy cannot resist natural disasters. The leading role played by agricultural producers' cooperatives in drought resistance and the superiority it showed made farmers even more demanding to move towards collectivization and further demanded to use machines to cultivate the land. The Five-Year Plan will gradually meet the needs of farmers.

    Deputy Luo Longji said: The formulation of the First Five-Year Plan is an important event of great international significance. He said that when he participated in the World Peace Congress, he had clearly seen that the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in carrying out the First Five-Year Plan on the basis of the national economic recovery for more than two years had already played a significant role internationally and received good responses. He said: The representatives of the World Peace Congress all know that the peaceful construction being carried out in New China is beneficial to world peace and serves world peace.

    Huaer Gongcheng Lie, a representative from the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, said that during the discussion of the Five-Year Plan, he deeply realized that the development of economic and cultural undertakings and the improvement of people's lives in various ethnic minority areas must be based on the general spirit of the Five-Year Plan, taking into account the different conditions of different regions, and taking care of both possibilities and needs, in order to move forward step by step and in a prepared manner. He believes that according to the provisions of the Five-Year Plan and the actual situation in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, the autonomous region should first vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production.

    Deputy Huang Shaohong pointed out in his speech that practicing thrift and opposing waste are important links to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan. He said, I feel that corruption is legally more serious than waste, but the loss of waste is far greater than corruption. He pointed out that it is wrong for some people to only pay attention to corruption and ignore waste and tolerate waste. He said that we must never tolerate the huge losses to the country caused by waste.

    Deputy Lu Dingyi made a speech at the meeting on the struggle between the two roads and the importance of strengthening ideological work.

    Lu Dingyi said that there are two roads in front of us. One is the socialist road, which will enable our industrial production level to catch up with and surpass the most powerful capitalist countries in the world in a few decades. The other is to take the capitalist road, the result of which will be the restoration of imperialism and feudal forces. The experience of the Chinese revolution for more than 100 years has long clearly told us that in the era when capitalism has developed to imperialism, wanting to take the capitalist road is just a reactionary delusion, just to pave the way for the counter-revolutionary restoration of imperialism and feudalism.

    Lu Dingyi pointed out that the revolutionary experience since 1927 has profoundly proved that either taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, or taking the capitalist road, one of the two must be chosen, and there is no middle road. The people of the whole country resolutely agree to take the socialist road and oppose taking the capitalist road, that is, the road of counter-revolutionary restoration.

    Lu Dingyi used the counter-revolutionary cases of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng as examples to illustrate that with the progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the class struggle has not eased, but has intensified. The counter-revolutionaries saw that the Chinese Communist Party and the people's power had unlimited prestige among the people, so they adopted double-dealing tactics and sneaked into our interior to fight us.

    Lu Dingyi criticized a dangerous idea that the realization of the First Five-Year Plan will be smooth sailing and will not go through serious struggles. He cited facts to prove that the process of realizing the Five-Year Plan cannot be simply regarded as a process of technical work, but should also be regarded as a process of class struggle.

    Based on the history of revolutionary development and the current situation of class struggle, Lu Dingyi emphasized the extreme importance of strengthening ideological work - promoting materialism and criticizing bourgeois idealism. He said that what counter-revolutionaries fear most is advocating the study of Marxism-Leninism, and that if the Chinese people want to be liberated and build China into a socialist society, they must study Marxism-Leninism, must take Marxism-Leninism as their guiding ideology, and must carry out a broader and more profound Marxist ideological movement than before. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in March this year to carry out an ideological movement to promote materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism. Only through large-scale theoretical work, so that the vast majority of cadres and intellectuals can improve their sense of smell and learn to fight against imperialism and feudal ideology, bourgeois ideology and rich peasant ideology, subjectivism and individualism, and various corrupt and decadent tendencies in their practical work, will the ideological and political unity of the people of the whole country be formed on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, so as to realize socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi said in his speech that according to the provisions of the draft of the First Five-Year Plan on the principles and tasks of water conservancy construction, the main tasks of water conservancy work at present are to reduce floods and droughts and increase grain and cotton production. If we can find ways to reduce floods and droughts every year, it will be equivalent to increasing production by tens of billions or hundreds of billions of kilograms of grain. There is still great potential for increasing the yield per unit area of agriculture by developing water conservancy.

    Fu Zuoyi reported in his speech on the progress of water conservancy projects on major rivers across the country. Many projects have improved their flood control capacity according to the flood level in 1954. The next month or so is the most critical time for flood prevention. We must be vigilant and fight to overcome this year's floods and strive for this year's bumper harvest.

    Fu Zuoyi said that relying on the broad masses of the people to develop farmland water conservancy in various parts of the country has a great effect on rapidly increasing grain and cotton production. According to typical investigations in various places, there is still a lot of room for development of small-scale water conservancy in various places. As for soil and water conservation work, in addition to the Yellow River basin being regarded as the national focus, which should be carried out vigorously by various departments and regions in cooperation, other areas with serious soil erosion should strive to experiment and promote.

    Deputy Long Yun said in his speech that my country's First Five-Year Plan stipulates that priority must be given to the development of heavy industry, and that thrift must be practiced and waste opposed to accumulate funds for the country. These regulations are correct. Long Yun also mentioned that after he made a short-term inspection in Shanxi this time, he realized that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is the only good way for the country to solve the grain problem during the period of economic construction. It not only guarantees the needs of industrial construction, but also stabilizes prices; urban residents, farmers in disaster areas, and rural grain-deficient households can also receive reasonable supplies. Most farmers recognize the correctness of this policy and unanimously support it.

    Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, talked about several issues that he thought should be paid attention to in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. He asked private industrialists and businessmen to honestly abide by national laws, be consistent in word and deed, and accept socialist transformation. He proposed that attention must be paid to the quality of projects in practicing thrift, and that in implementing agricultural cooperation, individual farmers must be actively led and helped. Huang Yanpei also expressed in his speech that he did not have a comprehensive understanding of the rural grain problem in the past, and his views on the situation of grain shortage, he feels are wrong today. He said that he fully agrees with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on the grain issue on the 21st.

    Minister of Forestry Liang Xi pointed out in his speech that forests can maintain soil and water, protect farmland water conservancy, and guarantee the wood needed for industrial and mining, transportation, construction, and other basic construction. Therefore, forestry construction is an indispensable and important part of the national economic development plan. However, forestry construction is a long-term and arduous task. To complete the forestry production tasks stipulated in the draft of the Five-Year Plan, the following tasks must be done well: (1) Further strengthen the protection of existing forests, especially fire prevention; (2) Actively carry out mountain production planning; (3) Continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously afforest; (4) Steadily carry out the work of closing mountains for afforestation; (5) Strengthen the management of timber felling in private forest areas; (6) Practice thrift and oppose waste.

    Deputy Chen Qiyou pointed out in his speech that some people one-sidedly emphasize that my country's population growth rate is high, and therefore express doubts about the grain production increase target stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, believing that farmers' lives will hardly improve. He cited the specific facts he saw when he inspected the state-owned Nanfang Farm and the agricultural production cooperative in Huangtugang Township in Beijing not long ago, and learned from there that the income of agricultural production cooperatives has increased by an average of one time compared to when they were still in mutual aid groups, and the income of state-owned farms has increased by more than 70% compared to cooperatives due to the use of machines. It can be seen that as long as agricultural cooperation, collectivization, and mechanization are gradually implemented, farmers can continuously increase their income and improve their lives.

    Guo Menghe, a drilling worker from the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu Province, said that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Yumen Oil Mine was run for more than ten years, but it was still dilapidated. After liberation, the number of wells drilled in 1954 alone was more than the number of wells drilled in the Kuomintang era in more than ten years. Many wells that were scrapped before liberation have now been repaired and are producing oil. Guo Menghe said: The country's socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization cannot be separated from oil. The Yumen Oil Mine is the first natural oil base in the motherland, and bears a particularly important responsibility during the First Five-Year Plan period. He said that he and all the workers in the mine must work hard to do a good job in the reconstruction and expansion of the oil mine, strive to find new oil fields, increase production, and produce more oil to support national construction.

    Minister of Supervision Qian Ying said that the more acute and complex class struggle in the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation is not only manifested in the domestic and foreign enemies destroying our construction undertakings, but also in the continuous intrusion and corrosion of feudal remnants and bourgeois ideology into the staff of our organs and enterprises, thus increasing many difficulties and losses in our construction undertakings. This is something we should always be vigilant about. In order to adapt to the requirements of the new period of class struggle, more effectively oppose bad people and bad deeds, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, it is necessary to further strengthen the national supervision work, give full play to the role of supervision work, and improve the ideological and combat effectiveness of supervision work. The supervisory organs at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party committees and governments at all levels, and with the assistance and support of the relevant departments, rely on the broad masses of working people to supervise and inspect the implementation of economic construction, especially industrial construction plans.

    Huang Jing, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, said that my country's machine building industry has a very backward foundation. After liberation, the technical level and manufacturing capacity have been greatly improved, but the fundamental problem at present is that there are few product varieties and poor quality. The main reason is that our technology is backward. In order to overcome the backwardness of the machine building industry, we must work hard in two aspects: on the one hand, we must build a number of new modern factories with the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to establish a technical foundation that fundamentally changes the backward situation of the machine building industry; on the other hand, we must carry out technical transformation of the original factories. When overcoming the backwardness of the machine building industry, we must make full use of the superior conditions of the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, while improving enterprise management, carrying out increasing production and practicing thrift, strengthening political and ideological work, and carrying out the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    Deputy Cai Tingkai said in his speech that the First Five-Year Plan clearly pointed out the correct principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This is a great help and encouragement to the people of the whole country in ideological understanding. Cai Tingkai described the achievements of my country in the construction of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts in the past few years, as well as the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and said that this is a good start for building a socialist society. He also said that in recent years, he has attended the World Peace Council and the World Peace Congress many times, and deeply felt that the achievements of my country's economic construction and peaceful diplomatic policy are increasingly praised and sympathized by the people of all countries. Deputy Wang Yilun said in his speech that Heilongjiang Province has a vast land area, with approximately 97.5 million mu of cultivated land, and nearly 100 million mu of arable land to be developed. Heilongjiang Province has reclaimed 13.5 million mu since 1949 and moved 500,000 people into rural areas. Heilongjiang Province has great potential for agricultural production. In the future, by strengthening the leadership of agricultural cooperation, reclaiming wasteland, improving farming techniques, and strengthening the leadership of state-owned farms, we can complete or overfulfill the agricultural production increase target and agricultural cooperation target set by the First Five-Year Plan for Heilongjiang Province. Deputy Wang Renzhong cited the case of counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries in Fusheng Township, Huangmei County, Hubei Province, usurping rural political power and implementing reactionary rule as an example to illustrate that the enemy is hostile to socialist construction and their sabotage activities are crazy and cunning. He said: In order to ensure the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture and develop agricultural production, we must resolutely give the enemy several more blows; we must deeply mobilize the masses and combine the transformation of backward townships with the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    Xu Jie, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Geology, said that in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of national construction, the planned workload of my country's geological work every year should be doubled from the previous year, and the tasks of the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan, namely 1955 to 1957, are even more arduous. Therefore, we must vigorously carry out systematic mineral prospecting and inspection work nationwide; vigorously carry out scientific research work and give play to the guiding role of scientific research work in mineral prospecting and exploration; implement the policy of increasing production and practicing thrift, strengthen the design budget and economic accounting system; strengthen school education and the work of training cadres in work, and strengthen the geological work team; earnestly strengthen political and ideological work, criticize bourgeois ideological style, and strictly prevent the sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionaries. Deputy Le Songsheng said in his speech that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing have implemented the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation in recent years, and socialist transformation work has achieved remarkable results. He pointed out that private industrialists and businessmen should closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, work hard to transform their thinking, love the country, abide by the law, actively operate, increase vigilance, actively participate in the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and at the same time work hard to increase production and practice thrift, and faithfully accept socialist transformation. Deputy Tao Lujia talked about the methods and achievements of Shanxi Province in tapping the potential of agricultural production in recent years. He summarized the experience of Shanxi Province in increasing agricultural production as follows: First, vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement; second, change the farming system, expand the area of multiple cropping, carry out basic land construction, and turn wasteland into fertile land; third, carry out soil and water conservation and the construction of small-scale water conservancy in a planned manner; fourth, systematically summarize and promote the experience of high yields of various crops, improve farming techniques, and expand the planting area of fine varieties and high-yielding crops; fifth, develop diversified economies, and promote the experience of the comprehensive combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy in Xigou Village and Yangjingdi Village, Pingxun County. He said that judging from the situation in Shanxi Province, the potential for increasing agricultural production is very great, and we should have full confidence in striving to overfulfill the target of agricultural production increase in the First Five-Year Plan. When talking about the great plan for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River, Tao Lujia said that the people of Shanxi Province will, together with the people of other provinces along the river, fully assume the due responsibility in accordance with the requirements of this plan. Deputy Gu Dacun said in his speech that Guangdong Province has always been a grain-deficient province. After years of increasing grain production, the grain situation has undergone fundamental changes. Not only is there no longer a shortage of grain, but it can also transfer a certain amount of grain to support national industrialization. The implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain has kept the grain market in Guangdong stable and guaranteed the stable life of the people throughout the province. Gu Dacun also pointed out that Guangdong is located on the front line of national defense, and the people of Guangdong will continue to fight against open and hidden enemies, consolidate coastal and border defenses, and defend the socialist construction cause of the motherland. Deputy Wang Guoxing said: The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region is located in the subtropics, has excellent natural conditions, crops can be harvested three times a year, has various mineral deposits and special products that meet the needs of industrial raw materials, has abundant forests, has excellent ports that can be opened up, and the marine fish and salt industries have development prospects. With these superior objective conditions, our confidence and determination to support the industrialization of the motherland have been strengthened. Our Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region is located on the front line of national defense. The US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and other counter-revolutionaries lurking inside will inevitably try every possible means to sabotage the cause of our people. We must further strengthen the fraternal unity between and within ethnic groups, maintain a high degree of vigilance, closely cooperate with the national defense army, and give a strong blow to all enemies who dare to invade and destroy construction. Wazha Muji, an Yi representative from the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Xikang, talked about the remarkable progress and development in political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings in the Yi area of ​​Liangshan, Xikang after liberation in recent years. The most important thing is to train a group of Yi cadres, and they are mainly responsible for managing their own affairs in the political power at all levels; the national relations have been greatly improved. At the same time, it also helped the Yi people develop health services, greatly reducing the incidence and mortality rate of the Yi people. He said: Due to these changes, the Yi people deeply felt the warmth of the motherland's big family and Chairman Mao's care for ethnic minorities. At the same time, judging from the development and changes in the Yi area in the past few years, only when our entire country has developed in all aspects, especially when socialist industrialization has developed, can we ensure that our ethnic minority areas can gradually transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, our Yi people must, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, work together for the realization of this plan.

    The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Cheng Qian, Tan Pingshan, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Guohua, Mei Lanfang, and Xiao Longyou. Today's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and adjourned at 7:40 p.m. The general discussion will continue tomorrow.

    全国人民代表大会代表继续发言
    新华社二十六日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天继续举行。全国人民代表大会代表和国家机关各部门负责人相继就本次会议的各项主要议程发言。
    今天在会上发言的有荣毅仁、蒋光鼐、赛福鼎、彭泽民、罗隆基、华尔功成烈、黄绍竑、陆定一、傅作义、龙云、黄炎培、梁希、陈其尤、郭孟和、钱瑛、黄敬、蔡廷锴、王一伦、王任重、许杰、乐松生、陶鲁笳、古大存、王国兴、瓦渣木基等二十五人。
    荣毅仁代表在发言中表示，一定要在国营经济领导、工人群众监督下，接受国家对他所经营的企业和个人的社会主义改造，改进经营管理，厉行节约、反对浪费，生产质量好的产品来供应人民需要；同时把盈利所得，依法纳税，购买公债，投资内地，来支援建设。今后工商业者必须说老实话、做老实事，积极地接受改造。同时要头脑清醒，提高警惕，协助政府彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐在发言中说，从纺织工业方面来看，第一个五年计划草案规定优先发展重工业的方针是完全正确的。在考虑五年计划中关于纺织工业的发展速度时，曾把原来较高的指标适当压缩，使之既照顾到人民生活的需要，又照顾到原料供应的可能，并符合国家优先发展重工业的政策。因此，五年计划为纺织工业规定的发展速度是适当的。蒋光鼐指出，为了克服纺织工业原料不足的困难，除农业上应尽可能增加产量外，纺织工业部门负有重大的责任。一方面，要尽量节约原料，一方面要多想办法开辟新的资源，研究利用各种可以利用的纤维，研究各种可以代用的原料。纺织工业在五年计划中，除了适当满足人民对纺织品方面日益增长的需要外，还有为国家积累资金的重大任务。因此，必须大力反对浪费，建立严格的节约制度。为此必须在所有企业管理人员中加强思想工作和政治工作，树立经济核算思想和精打细算的作风，进一步提高企业管理的水平。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长赛福鼎在发言中叙述了新疆省在国民经济恢复时期中所已达到的成就和在第一个五年计划国民经济发展时期中将要达到的指标，他说，新疆省执行第一个五年计划的任务是：以大力发展农业和畜牧业生产为中心，同时，整顿、提高现有工矿企业，举办地方供、产、销能够平衡的新的工业，发展交通运输、邮电事业，有步骤地发展国营商业和合作社商业，扩大城乡物资交流，发展对苏联的贸易，对个体农业、手工业和私营工商业逐步实行社会主义改造，保证社会主义经济在全部国民经济中的比重逐年增长，以适当地满足各族人民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要。赛福鼎说：新疆各民族人民都迫切希望铁路很快通到新疆，他们一定能够做好为迎接兰新铁路修通而要做的一切准备工作，创造兰新铁路修通后在新疆开始大规模经济建设所需要的条件。
    彭泽民代表在发言中叙述了他在视察工作中看到的广东省农民在党和政府领导下努力抗旱的情形。他说：从这次抗旱情况看来，使他深深感到第一个五年计划中关于农业的改造和发展计划的正确性和重要性。他说，总路线的宣传教育和这次抗旱的经验，深刻地教育了农民，使他们感到落后的小农经济不可能抵御自然灾害。抗旱中农业生产合作社所起的带头作用和它所显示出来的优越性，使农民更加要求走向集体化，并进一步要求用机器来耕地。而五年计划将会逐步满足农民的要求。
    罗隆基代表说：制定第一个五年计划是有重要的国际意义的一件大事。他说他在参加世界和平大会的时候，已经明显地看出，两年多来中国人民在国家经济恢复的基础上进行第一个五年计划的光辉成绩，已经在国际上起了重大的作用，得到了良好的反应。他说：世界和平大会的代表们都知道，新中国正在进行的和平建设事业是对世界和平有利的，是为世界和平服务的。
    来自四川省藏族自治区的华尔功成烈代表说，在五年计划的讨论中，他自己深刻地体会到，各少数民族地区的经济文化事业的发展，人民生活的提高，必须在五年计划总的精神下，根据不同地区的不同条件，照顾到可能和需要两个方面，来有步骤有准备地前进。他认为根据五年计划规定和四川省藏族自治区的实际情况，自治区首先应该大力发展农牧业生产。
    黄绍竑代表在发言中指出，厉行节约、反对浪费是保证五年计划完成的重要环节。他说，我觉得贪污犯罪在法律的意义上重于浪费，但浪费的损失则远大于贪污。他指出，有些人仅仅重视贪污而忽视浪费、原谅浪费是不对的，他说，决不能容忍因浪费而造成国家的巨大损失。
    陆定一代表就两条道路的斗争和加强思想工作的重要性在会上作了发言。
    陆定一说，在我们面前放着两条道路，一条是社会主义的道路，使我们的工业生产水平在几十年内赶上和超过世界上最强大的资本主义国家。另一条是走资本主义道路，其结果将是帝国主义和封建势力的复辟。一百多年来中国革命的经验早已清楚地告诉我们，在资本主义已经发展到帝国主义的时代，要想走资本主义的道路，只是反动的妄想，只是为了帝国主义和封建主义的反革命复辟开辟道路。
    陆定一指出，一九二七年以来的革命经验深刻地证明，或者是在中国共产党和人民政府领导下走社会主义的道路，或者是走资本主义道路，二者必居其一，中间的道路是没有的。全国人民是坚决赞成走社会主义道路的，反对走资本主义道路即反革命复辟的道路的。
    陆定一以潘汉年、胡风反革命案件为例，说明随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，阶级斗争不是缓和了，而是尖锐化了。反革命分子看到中国共产党和人民政权在人民群众中有无限威信，因而采取两面派的手段，钻到我们内部来同我们进行斗争。
    陆定一批判了一种危险的想法，这种想法以为，第一个五年计划的实现，将是风平浪静、不经过严重的斗争。他列举事实证明：不能把实现五年计划的过程，仅仅看作是技术工作的过程，而应该同时把它看作是阶级斗争的过程。
    陆定一根据革命发展的历史和目前阶级斗争的情况，强调指出加强思想工作——宣传唯物主义和批判资产阶级唯心主义——的极端重要性。他说，反革命分子最怕的就是提倡学习马克思列宁主义，而中国人民要解放，要把中国建设成社会主义社会，就一定要学习马克思列宁主义，一定要以马克思列宁主义作为指导思想，一定要进行比以前更广泛更深刻的马克思主义的思想运动。中国共产党中央委员会在今年三月已决定进行宣传唯物主义和批判资产阶级唯心主义的思想运动。只有经过大规模的理论工作，使绝大多数的干部和知识分子提高嗅觉，学会在实际工作中去同帝国主义思想和封建思想，同资产阶级思想和富农思想，同主观主义和个人主义，同各种腐化堕落的倾向进行斗争，才会形成全国人民在马克思列宁主义基础上的思想上和政治上的一致性，来实现社会主义建设与社会主义改造。
    水利部部长傅作义在发言中说，根据第一个五年计划草案对水利建设的方针任务的规定，当前水利工作的主要任务是减轻水旱灾害，增加粮棉生产。每年如果能够设法减轻水旱灾害，就等于增产几十亿斤或几百亿斤粮食。从发展水利来提高农业单位面积产量，还存在着很大的潜力。
    傅作义发言中报告了全国各地主要河流的水利工程进展情况，许多工程根据一九五四年洪水位提高了防洪能力。今后一个多月，是防汛最紧要的时间，我们要提高警惕，为战胜今年的洪水，争取今年的丰收而斗争。
    傅作义说，依靠广大人民群众，在全国各地发展农田水利，对迅速增加粮棉生产有很大作用，根据各地典型调查，各地小型水利都还有很大的发展余地。至于水土保持工作，除黄河流域要当作全国重点，由各部门各地区合作大力进行外，其他水土流失严重地区都应努力试验推广。
    龙云代表在发言中说，我国第一个五年计划规定必须优先发展重工业，必须厉行节约、反对浪费，为国家积累资金，这些规定都是正确的。龙云同时谈到，他此次到山西作了一次短期视察以后，体会到粮食统购统销政策是国家在经济建设时期解决粮食问题的唯一好办法。既保证了工业建设的需要，又稳定了物价；城市居民、灾区农民及农村缺粮户也能得到合理供应，大多数农民都认识到这个政策的正确性，都一致拥护。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长黄炎培在发言中谈到在执行五年计划中在他看来应该注意的几个问题。他要求私营工商业者必须老老实实地遵守国家法律，言行一致，接受社会主义改造。他提出在厉行节约中必须注意工程质量，在实行农业合作化时必须积极地领导和帮助单干农户。黄炎培在发言中还表示，他过去对农村粮食问题没有全面了解，对缺粮情况的看法，今天觉得是错误的了。他说，他对陈云副总理在二十一日关于粮食问题的发言完全同意。
    林业部部长梁希在发言中指出，森林能保持水土，保障农田水利，保证工矿、交通、建筑及其它基本建设所需要的木材。因此，林业建设是发展国民经济计划中不可缺少的一个重要部分。但林业建设是一项长期性的、艰巨的任务，要完成五年计划草案中规定的林业生产任务，必须作好下列各项工作：（一）进一步加强现有森林的保护工作，特别是防火工作；（二）积极进行山区生产规划工作；（三）继续发动群众大力造林；（四）稳步开展封山育林工作；（五）加强对私有林区木材采伐的管理工作；（六）厉行节约，反对浪费。
    陈其尤代表在发言中指出，有人片面强调我国人口增加率大，因而对第一个五年计划规定粮食增产指标表示怀疑，认为农民生活将很少改善，这种看法是不对的。他引用不久前视察北京市国营南郊农场和黄土岗乡农业生产合作社时所看到的具体事实，从那儿了解到农业生产合作社比还在互助组时的收入平均增加一倍，而国营农场由于使用机器，其收入又比合作社增加百分之七十以上。可见，只要逐步实行农业合作化、集体化和机械化，就能不断使农民增加收入，改善生活。
    甘肃省代表、玉门油矿钻井工人郭孟和说，在国民党反动统治时期，玉门油矿办了十几年，还是破破烂烂。解放后光是一九五四年一年打的井，就比国民党时代十几年打的井还要多。解放前许多报废了的井，现在也都修好出油了。郭孟和说：国家的社会主义工业化和农业机械化，都离不了石油。玉门油矿是祖国第一个天然石油基地，在第一个五年计划期间，负有特别重要的责任。他表示他和全矿职工一定要努力做好油矿的改建和扩建工作，努力寻找新的油田，增加产量，生产更多的石油来支援国家建设。
    监察部部长钱瑛说，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中更加尖锐和复杂的阶级斗争，不仅表现在国内外敌人破坏我们的建设事业，而且还表现在封建残余和资产阶级思想不断向我们机关、企业中的工作人员侵袭腐蚀，因而增加了我们建设事业的许多困难和损失，这是值得我们时刻警惕的。为了适应阶级斗争新时期的要求，更有效地反对坏人坏事，以保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，必须进一步加强国家监察工作，充分发挥监察工作的作用，提高监察工作的思想性和战斗性。各级监察机关必须在各级党委和政府的领导下，在各有关部门的协助、支持下，依靠广大劳动人民群众，监督和检查经济建设特别是工业建设计划的执行情况。
    第一机械工业部部长黄敬在发言中说，我国机械工业的基础很落后，解放后，技术水平和制造能力有了很大提高，但当前根本问题是产品品种少，质量差，其主要原因在于我们的技术落后。为着克服机械工业的技术落后状况，必须从两个方面努力：一方面要在苏联和各人民民主国家的技术援助下建设一批新的现代化的工厂，以建立根本改变机械工业落后状况的技术基础；另一方面还要对原有工厂进行技术改造。在克服机械工业技术落后状况的时候，必须充分利用苏联和各人民民主国家的援助这个优越条件，同时改善企业管理，开展增产节约，加强政治思想工作，进行肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争。
    蔡廷锴代表在发言时说，第一个五年计划明确地指出了优先发展重工业这一正确的方针，这对全国人民在思想认识上是一个很大的帮助和鼓舞，蔡廷锴叙述了以往几年我国在工业、农业、手工业的建设以及对私营工商业社会主义改造方面的成就后说，这就是建设社会主义社会的良好开端。他又说，几年来他曾多次出席世界和平理事会和世界和平大会，深深感到：我国经济建设的成就和和平外交政策日益得到各国人民的赞美和同情。王一伦代表在发言中说，黑龙江省土地面积广阔，现有已耕土地约九千七百五十万亩，还有可耕地近一亿亩待开发。黑龙江省从一九四九年以来已经开垦了一千三百五十万亩，移入农村人口五十万人。黑龙江省农业生产的潜力很大的。今后从加强农业合作化的领导，开垦荒地，改进农作技术，并加强国营农场的领导等方面去努力，可以完成或超额完成第一个五年计划规定黑龙江省的农业增产指标和农业合作化指标。王任重代表在发言中以湖北省黄梅县福胜乡反革命分子和反动分子篡夺乡村政权实行反动统治的事件为例，说明敌人对社会主义建设事业是仇视的，他们的破坏活动是疯狂的和诡计多端的。他说：为了保障农业社会主义改造事业，发展农业生产，必须坚决地再给敌人几次打击；要深入发动群众，把改造落后乡与镇压反革命的工作结合起来进行。
    地质部副部长许杰在发言中说，为着适应国家建设迅速发展的需要，我国地质工作每年计划的工作量都要比上一年的增加一倍，第一个五年计划的后三年即一九五五到一九五七年的任务更加繁重。因此，必须在全国范围内大力开展系统的矿产普查，检查工作；大力开展科学研究工作，发挥科学研究工作对矿产普查及勘探工作的指导作用；贯彻增产节约方针，加强设计预算及经济核算制；加强学校教育与在工作中培养干部的工作，壮大地质工作队伍；认真加强政治思想工作，批判资产阶级思想作风，严防暗藏反革命分子的破坏。乐松生代表在发言中说，北京市资本主义工商业几年来在共产党和人民政府领导下，贯彻了利用、限制和改造的政策，社会主义改造工作已有了显著的成绩。他指出，私营工商业者应紧密团结在中国共产党的周围，努力改造思想，爱国守法，积极经营，提高警惕，积极参加肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争，同时努力增产节约，忠诚地接受社会主义改造。陶鲁笳代表在发言中谈到山西省几年来发掘农业生产潜力的办法和所获得的成绩。他把山西省农业增产的经验归纳如下几点：第一、大力发展互助合作运动；第二、改变耕作制度，扩大复播面积，进行土地基本建设，变荒地为良田；第三、有计划地进行水土保持和兴修小型水利的工作；第四、系统地总结与推广各种作物的丰产经验，改进耕作技术，扩大优良品种和高产作物的播种面积；第五、发展多种经济，推广平顺县西沟村和羊井底村农、林、畜牧、水利全面结合的经验。他说，从山西省的情况来看，农业增产的潜力是很大的，我们完全应该有信心争取超额完成第一个五年计划中农业增产要求达到的指标。陶鲁笳在谈到黄河综合利用的伟大计划时说，山西省人民将和其他沿河各省人民一道，按照这一规划的要求，充分地担负起应尽的责任。古大存代表在发言中说，广东省一直是缺粮省份，经过连年粮食增产，粮食情况已发生根本变化，不仅不再缺粮，而且还能外调一定数量粮食支援国家工业化。粮食统购统销的实施，使广东粮食市场一直平稳，保障了全省人民安定的生活。古大存同时指出：广东地处国防前线，广东人民将继续同公开的和隐蔽的敌人进行斗争，巩固海防边防，保卫祖国的社会主义建设事业。王国兴代表说：海南黎族苗族自治区地处亚热带，有优良的自然条件，农作物年可三熟，有着适应工业原料需要的各种矿藏和特产，有丰富的森林，有可开辟的优良港口，海产鱼盐业都有发展前途，有了这些优越的客观条件，更加强了我们支援祖国工业化的信心和决心。我们海南黎族苗族自治区处在祖国国防前线，美蒋特务及其他潜藏在内部的反革命分子，必然会千方百计地来破坏我们人民的事业，我们一定要进一步加强民族之间和民族内部的友爱团结，保持高度警惕性，密切配合国防大军，给予敢于侵犯与破坏建设的一切敌人以有力打击。西康凉山彝族自治州的彝族代表瓦渣木基在发言中谈到西康凉山彝族地区解放后几年来在政治、经济、文化事业等方面所获得的显著进步和发展。最重要的是培养了一批彝族干部，在各级政权中主要是由他们来管理自己的事务；民族关系得到了很大的改善。同时，还帮助彝族发展卫生事业，使彝族人民的疾病和死亡率大为减少。他说：由于这些变化，使彝族人民深切体会到祖国大家庭的温暖和毛主席对少数民族的关怀。同时，从彝族地区几年来的发展变化看，只有我们整个国家在各方面有了发展，特别是社会主义工业化有了发展，才能保证我们少数民族地区能够逐步过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此，我们彝族人民必须和全国各族人民一道，共同为这一计划的实现而努力。今天会议的执行主席是：程潜、谭平山、廖承志、张国华、梅兰芳、萧龙友。今天的会议从下午三时开始，七时四十分休会。明天继续进行大会讨论。
