　　What to do about missing seedlings when interplanting sweet potatoes in summer

　　Last year, many major sweet potato producing areas suffered from floods, resulting in reduced sweet potato production and poor quality of seed potatoes. Frequent rain and snow in winter also caused widespread rotting and collapse of cellars. Overwintering sweet potato seedlings in Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces have also been reduced due to the cold winter and dry spring. Therefore, this year's summer planting is generally experiencing a shortage of sweet potato seedlings. At present, it is the time for summer sweet potato cutting and planting. Agricultural departments in various places must attach importance to leading farmers to solve the problem of seedling shortage from all aspects, so as to plant in a timely manner and strive to expand the planting area of ​​sweet potatoes according to plan.
　　The main way to solve the problem of seedlings is to make full use of all existing seedling sources. We must strengthen cultivation management of existing sweet potato seedling fields and early-planted sweet potato fields that are ready to be cut for vines, and carry out fertilization and irrigation to make the seedlings rapidly branch and propagate. In areas that are accustomed to planting spring sweet potatoes, some seedlings can also be appropriately cut for summer interplanting without affecting the yield of spring sweet potatoes. For seed potatoes in warm beds that have had spring sweet potato seedlings cut from them, do not eat them or feed them to pigs, but continue to strengthen management and cut seedlings one after another. In addition, farmers should be educated to change their habit of pulling seedlings when picking sweet potato seedlings, and instead adopt the method of cutting and picking seedlings two or three nodes or more above the surface of the seedling bed. This will not only reduce damage to the seed potatoes and allow the axillary buds of the seedling stubble to quickly develop into new seedlings, but also reduce black spot disease infection and improve the survival rate of seedlings.
　　On the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, the organization can coordinate between those with more seedlings and those with fewer seedlings, or organize rural peddlers to transport them over short distances. Some areas have always had the habit of cultivating sweet potato seedlings to supply other places. Agricultural departments should seize the opportunity to provide technical guidance to these areas, vigorously cultivate sweet potato seedlings, and organize farmers in seedling-deficient areas to collectively order from these areas.

　　夏插甘薯缺苗该怎么办
　　孙叔涵
    去年许多主要甘薯产区因遭受水灾，甘薯减产，种薯质量也差；冬季雨雪频繁，又普遍发生烂窖塌窖的事情。福建、广东等省的越冬薯苗也因为冬寒春旱而减收。因此，今年夏种中普遍感到甘薯苗蔓不足。目前正是夏薯扦插时期，各地农业部门必须重视领导农民从各方面解决薯苗缺乏问题，做到适时扦插，力求按计划扩大甘薯种植面积。
    解决薯苗问题的主要办法，是充分利用现有的一切苗源。对现有准备剪蔓的薯苗田和早栽的薯田，要加强栽培管理，进行施肥、灌溉，使薯苗迅速分枝蕃殖。习惯栽春薯的地区，在不影响春薯产量的情况下，也可以适当剪取部分薯苗作夏插用。对于温床里剪过春薯苗的种薯，不要吃掉或喂猪，而应继续加强管理，陆续剪苗。此外，要教育农民在采摘薯苗时改变拔苗的习惯，采取剪摘距苗床床面两三个节以上的苗的方法。这样，不但可以少伤种薯，使苗茬腋芽迅速抽成新苗，还可以减少黑斑病感染，提高幼苗成活率。
    在群众自愿的原则下，可以组织苗多的和苗少的互相调剂，或组织农村小贩短程贩运。有些地区从来就有培育薯苗供应外地的习惯，农业部门应该抓紧对这些地区的技术指导，大力培育薯苗，并组织缺苗区的农民去这些地区集体订购。
