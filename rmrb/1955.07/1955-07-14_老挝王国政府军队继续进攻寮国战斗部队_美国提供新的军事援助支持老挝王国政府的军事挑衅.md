Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: Lao sources report that the situation in Laos has recently become tense due to the Royal Lao Government army's intensified military offensives against the Lao fighting units.

A few days ago, the Royal Lao Government mobilized a large number of troops to launch a large-scale offensive against the Lao fighting units in the Muong Bun area of ​​Sam Neua province. This offensive marked a new high point in the Royal Army's illegal attacks on the Lao fighting units' assembly areas for more than a month.

Since the Royal Lao Government publicly announced in early June that it would "take military measures" against the Lao fighting units, the Royal Army has launched dozens of attacks on the Lao fighting units in Muong Bun, Bon Ouen, Na Kang, Na Khong, Ba Ka, Ba Pei, Na Sa La, and other places in Sam Neua province, occupying eleven strongholds. From July 1st to 5th, the Lao Kingdom side airdropped a large number of troops and American weapons, ammunition, and equipment in the area around Muong Bun, actively preparing to expand military operations. On July 5th, the Royal Army launched a fierce attack on the Lao fighting units in the area south of Muong Bun and north of Bon Ouen. The Lao fighting units, having reached the limit of their tolerance, rose up in self-defense, repelled the Royal Army's provocative offensive, and recovered the three strongholds of Na Sa La, Na Sang, and Ba Pei on the same day.

After this, the Royal Lao Government mobilized a large number of troops again and continuously transferred four infantry battalions from Bon Ban and Xieng Khouang from July 5th to 8th, openly invading the Muong Bun area. At the same time, it also airdropped hundreds of paratroopers into this area, launching a new offensive against the Lao fighting units stationed three kilometers east of Muong Bun. According to a United Press report, the Royal Government also requisitioned the aircraft of "Lao Aviation" to airdrop paratroopers to the Muong Bun area.

This violation of the Geneva Accords by the Kingdom of Laos has been encouraged and supported by the United States. Just as the Royal Lao Government recently launched its offensive, the United States provided the Royal Lao Government with another 12 million US dollars in military aid. After the offensive began, the US State Department spokesman defended the actions of the Royal Lao Government on the 9th, describing the offensive as being launched by the Lao fighting units.

According to foreign news agencies, the fighting in Sam Neua province has subsided in the past two days, but news from Laos says that the Royal Lao Government has already assembled seven battalions of troops around Sam Neua province, and the situation there is fraught with the danger of a new and larger-scale conflict breaking out.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: News from Vientiane shows that the United States' continuous provision of military aid to the Royal Lao Government in violation of the Geneva Accords, and its instigation of the Lao army to use force to occupy the assembly areas of the Lao fighting units, is an important reason for the recent increasing tension in Laos.

According to recent broadcasts by Vientiane Radio, US Ambassador to Laos, J. Graham Parsons, handed a check for 12 million US dollars to the Royal Lao Government on July 5th "to build up the Lao army." Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Souvanna Phouma accepted the check on behalf of the Royal Lao Government. According to the broadcast, the total amount of "this aid" provided by the United States to Laos since the beginning of this year has reached 35 million US dollars.

Vientiane Radio also quoted a public statement from the Royal Lao Government openly stating that this "aid" is in line with the United States' "political propositions," and that the United States is giving the Royal Lao Government such "aid" because the Kingdom of Laos "must build a strong army." The Royal Lao Government also believes in its public statement that the United States will provide the Royal Lao Government with another batch of "funds" if necessary in the next six months.

    老挝王国政府军队继续进攻寮国战斗部队
    美国提供新的军事援助支持老挝王国政府的军事挑衅
    新华社河内十三日电　老挝消息：老挝的局势最近由于老挝王国政府军队变本加厉地对寮国战斗部队发动军事进攻而紧张起来了。
    几天以前，老挝王国政府调动了大批军队向桑怒省芒奔地区的寮国战斗部队发动大规模的进攻。这次进攻使一个多月来王国军队对寮国战斗部队集结区的非法进攻达到了新的高潮。
    自从老挝王国政府在六月初公开宣布要对寮国战斗部队“采取军事措施”以后，王国军队已经向桑怒省的芒奔、本玩、那岗、那空、巴卡、巴培、那萨拉等地的寮国战斗部队发动了几十次进攻，侵占了十一处据点。从七月一日到五日，老挝王国方面在芒奔周围地区空投了大批军队和美国的武器、弹药和装备，积极准备扩大军事行动。七月五日，王国军队在芒奔以南的本玩以北地区对寮国战斗部队发动了猛烈的攻击。寮国战斗部队忍无可忍，奋起自卫，打退了王国军队的挑衅进攻，并且在当天收复了那萨拉、那桑和巴培三个据点。
    在此以后，老挝王国政府又调集大量军队在七月五日到八日连续从本班和川圹调动四个步兵营，公开侵入芒奔区，同时还把成百个伞兵空投到这个地区，向驻扎芒奔以东三公里处的寮国战斗部队发动新的攻势，据合众社消息说，王国政府为了向芒奔地区空投伞兵，还曾征用了“老挝航空公司”的飞机。
    老挝王国这种违反日内瓦协定的进攻受到了美国方面的鼓励和支持。就在老挝王国政府最近发动进攻的时候，美国又给了老挝王国政府一千二百万美元的军事援助。在进攻开始之后，美国国务院发言人就在九日为老挝王国政府的行动辩护，把进攻说成是寮国战斗部队发动的。
    据外国通讯社报道，这两天桑怒省的战事已归于沉寂，但是从老挝来的消息说，老挝王国政府又已经在桑怒省周围集结了七个营的军队，那里的局势充满了爆发新的更大规模的冲突的危险。
    新华社河内十三日电　万象来的消息表明，美国违反日内瓦协定不断对老挝王国政府提供军事援助、唆使老挝军队用武力侵占寮国战斗部队的集结区，是最近老挝局势日趋紧张的重要原因。
    据万象电台最近广播，美国驻老挝大使约斯特在七月五日交给老挝王国政府一千二百万美元的支票，“用来建立老挝的军队”。代表老挝王国政府接受支票的是副首相兼国防大臣梭发那·富马。据广播说，今年年初以来美国向老挝提供的“这种援助”，总额已达三千五百万美元。
    万象电台还引用了老挝王国政府的公报公开表示，这种“援助”是符合美国的“政治主张”的，美国给老挝王国这样的“援助”是由于老挝王国“必须建立强大的军队”。老挝王国政府在公报中还认为在今后的六个月内，如果有必要的话，美国还要另外给老挝王国政府一批“资金”。
