    Letter from the World Mothers' Congress to the Heads of Government of the Four Powers
    We, the representatives of mothers from sixty-six countries gathered in Lausanne for the World Mothers' Congress, approve of the convocation of the summit conference of the governments of the Four Powers. We fervently hope that the work of this conference will be successful and fruitful, and hope that the sincerity that promoted the convening of this conference can be constantly maintained during the talks to ensure the complete success of the conference.
    We, the women who create life and have a deep responsibility for the future, the millions of women who have suffered and sacrificed in recent wars, appeal to you who today hold the power to determine the fate of mankind.
    We hope and expect the following principles to be reaffirmed:
    All disputes in international life, including the problems of divided countries that threaten the cause of peace, can and must be resolved by means other than resorting to force;
    A system of collective security can be established based on the principles of peaceful coexistence adopted by the peoples of all countries at the Bandung Conference;
    Conditions should be created for practical and universal disarmament by all countries;
    International agreements should be reached immediately to ban the manufacture of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, to provide for and supervise the destruction of such weapons, and to ban future testing of such weapons;
    The widest possible international cooperation should be developed in the peaceful use of atomic energy;
    Barriers to international mutual understanding should be removed;
    Measures should be taken to ensure economic, social and cultural cooperation, which is essential to friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of all countries.
    The mothers of the world hope that the outcome of the conference will help to solve all these problems, and it is precisely for this reason that they will follow the work of the summit conference of the governments of the Four Powers with deep attention and hope.

    世界母亲大会给四大国政府首脑会议的信
    我们、聚集在洛桑举行世界母亲大会的六十六个国家的母亲代表，赞成召开四大国政府首脑会议。我们热烈盼望这个会议的工作获得成功和富有成果，并且希望促成这次会议召开的诚意在会谈的过程中能够经常保持，以保证会议的完全成功。
    创造生命而对未来具有深切责任感的妇女们、在最近几次战争中受尽苦难和蒙受牺牲的数以百万计的妇女们，向今天掌握着决定人类命运的权力的你们呼吁。
    我们希望和期待下列原则得到重申：
    国际生活里的一切争端，包括那些陷于成为对和平事业的威胁的分裂状态的国家的问题，能够而且必须通过不是诉诸武力的办法来解决；
    集体安全体系可以根据在万隆会议上各国人们通过的和平共处的原则建立起来；
    应该为各国切实地和普遍地裁减军备创造条件；
    应该立即达成国际协议来禁止制造原子武器和热核子武器，规定和监督销毁这种武器和禁止今后试验这种武器；
    应该在和平利用原子能方面发展尽可能广泛的国际合作；
    应该消除妨碍国际间相互谅解的障碍；
    应该采取措施来保证在经济、社会、文化方面的合作，这种合作对各国人民之间的友好和相互谅解是十分重要的。
    世界各国的母亲希望会议的结果会有助于解决这一切问题，正是因为如此，她们将怀着深切的注意和希望来注视四大国政府首脑会议的工作。
