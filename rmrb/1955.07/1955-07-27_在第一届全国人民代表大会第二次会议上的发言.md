**Speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress**

**Zhang Guohua's Speech**

I fully agree with and support the first five-year plan for the development of our national economy and the reports made by several vice premiers and Peng Zhen, vice chairman, to the Congress.

The first five-year plan is the first plan to lead our people of all nationalities towards a happy socialist society. Implementing this plan will further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, further strengthen our national defense, and create conditions for improving the material and cultural lives of our people of all ethnic groups. The plan pays full attention to promoting the economic and cultural development of the Tibet region. In March this year, the State Council's two decisions on the transportation and construction of Tibet, as well as the previous construction of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways, are all part of the first five-year plan. The completion of the five-year plan will create better conditions for the economic and cultural development of Tibet, which will greatly strengthen unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. Therefore, the implementation of the first five-year plan is a matter of vital interest to the people of Tibet. We are willing to work hard in Tibet to fulfill the tasks and requirements set out in this great plan.

Our first five-year plan has been implemented for more than two years, and great victories have been achieved in the development of the national economy in various parts of the country. In Tibet, significant achievements have also been made in political, economic, and cultural work. It is particularly worth noting that the unity between Tibet and the other ethnic groups of the motherland, as well as within Tibet, has been strengthened.

In September last year, the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, and the Panchen Lama, Choekyi Gyaltsen, representing the Tibetan people, came to Beijing together to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress and the second session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They participated in the discussion and formulation of the Constitution and were elected as national leaders. During the same period, the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Lama's Kanbu Council reached an agreement on historical and outstanding issues. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama also participated in the State Council's meeting to discuss Tibet's work. This is a major event in the history of the Tibetan people.

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama have recently returned safely to Lhasa and Shigatse, respectively, and have been warmly welcomed by all sectors. The Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways were fully opened to traffic in December last year. The construction of these two highways is world-renowned for its difficulty. From 1950 to 1951, when the country was in the period of economic recovery, the Central Government instructed the troops and personnel entering Tibet to build these two highways. During the construction, the Central Government allocated nearly three billion yuan, and people from all over the country provided great support in manpower, materials, and technology. I would like to express my gratitude here. On the plateau with an average altitude of 3,500 meters, in thin air and a climate with drastic changes, the troops and workers entering Tibet displayed a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, persevering in extremely arduous struggles for years, finally overcoming natural obstacles such as high mountains, rapid currents, glaciers, quicksand, forests, swamps, severe cold, and snowstorms, and successfully completing the great tasks given by the Party and the government. Many heroic deeds emerged during the construction. The Tibetan people and the local government also contributed greatly to the support and transportation work for the highway construction (for example, the Changdu region alone transported 6.3 million loads of materials). The completion of these two highway projects shocked the world and is an example of the bravery and wisdom of the Chinese people in their struggle with nature.

The opening of the highways has greatly changed the inconvenient transportation situation between Tibet and the outside world, strengthened the unity between the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the motherland, created conditions for the support of Tibet's construction from various places, and consolidated our national defense in the southwestern border.

From the perspective of Tibet's economic situation after the opening of the highways, the most notable change is the abundant supply of goods and stable prices in major cities. The markets in Changdu, Lhasa, Heihe, and Shigatse have seen the appearance of industrial products made in the interior of the country (in Changdu, this type of commodity already accounts for more than 90% of the market total). Through state-owned trading companies, they are also sold to remote mountain areas in Tibet. The prices of daily necessities in major cities have been reduced by an average of 15% compared to before the opening of the highways, improving the living standards of residents. Along the highway, previously desolate places have seen the emergence of new prosperous towns.

People love the highways because these two highways have solved their transportation difficulties and brought the care and help of people from all over the country to the Tibetan people. The last major project of the Kangding-Tibet highway, the Lhasa River Bridge, was completed in February this year. The 80-meter first phase of the water surface project was completed in just 12 days; on the day the car team first crossed the bridge, the residents of Lhasa rushed onto the bridge. Some prayed to the bridge, calling it Chairman Mao's bridge. Others exclaimed, "What we used to dream of has come true today." Now, the railings of the bridge are filled with khatas and prayer flags, fluttering in the wind, and the Tibetan people's sincere and simple affection for the bridge is placed on them.

On the night of July 14 last year, the ice dam in the Jiangzi region of Tibet collapsed, causing the Yarlung Zangbo River to flood, sweeping away many villages and spreading to the land of four counties. When the flood suddenly arrived, the troops and personnel stationed there first rescued the Tibetan people and their property in the flood. Two soldiers sacrificed their lives for this. The next day, after the flood receded, the military region immediately allocated military rations for relief. The responsible cadres and workers worked tirelessly day and night to save the disaster-stricken people. Their love and concern for the disaster-stricken people deeply moved the Tibetan people. There was a general reflection: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not selfish and can sacrifice themselves to save people." The Central People's Government, upon hearing the news, quickly allocated a large sum of money for relief, and a donation campaign was also launched in the military departments entering Tibet (a total of 120,000 silver dollars were donated, and some soldiers donated three months' allowances). Under the care of the Central Government, the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Lama's Kanbu Council, and the Tibet Military Region jointly organized a disaster relief committee to carry out the distribution of clothes, food, draft animals, and production tools, and organized relief work through labor. On average, each disaster-stricken person received relief materials worth 50 yuan. Due to the timely and prompt relief, the lives and production of the disaster-stricken people quickly stabilized.

The troops and personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have correctly implemented Chairman Mao's policies on ethnic minorities and religion over the past few years, helping the Tibetan people improve their lives as much as possible, thus gradually gaining the trust of the Tibetan people. The work and life of the past few years have made most of us comrades develop a deep affection for the Tibetan people and the local area of Tibet. In the past, during the military advance, road construction, and today's various work, the Tibetan people have provided us with great assistance; we are deeply convinced that with the bravery, wisdom, and diligence of the Tibetan people and the rich resources of the local area of Tibet, the Tibetan people will make greater contributions to the construction of the motherland. We are willing to work long-term in Tibet to help build Tibet and defend the border of the motherland.

In addition, significant achievements have been made in trade, banking, cadre training, and medical and health care.

All these achievements have been made under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the support of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, the support of the people of the whole country, and the joint efforts of the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

Although the work in Tibet has achieved great results, we still have many shortcomings. Some of the personnel entering Tibet still have remnants of Han chauvinism to varying degrees, which affects ethnic unity to varying degrees. Some cadres have become arrogant and complacent due to their achievements in work. A few cadres lack a high sense of patriotism and are not willing to work long-term in Tibet. There are times when impatience appears in the work. There have been wasteful phenomena in the expenditures of organs and troops, and in the survey work of road construction. These shortcomings and errors have been checked, educated, and corrected, and we must remain vigilant and prevent them in the future.

The first five-year plan requires all ethnic groups in the country to strengthen unity, strengthen cooperation, and actively participate in the political life and economic construction of the whole country. In this spirit, in the Tibet region, we should strive to strengthen the unity between the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the motherland and to fully implement Tibetan regional autonomy.

The Tibet region has rich resources, and both agriculture and animal husbandry have broad prospects for development. In the future, we will continue to carry out resource surveys and strengthen agricultural and animal husbandry production, especially paying attention to the development of animal husbandry work.

This year is the third year of the first five-year plan. After the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama returned to Tibet, the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will soon begin. According to the decision of the State Council, the maintenance and repair work of the Kangding-Tibet highway has already begun. The road from Lhasa to Shigatse has completed the survey work, and the road from Gyangze to Shigatse is under construction. The Tibet Engineering Survey Team has arrived in Lhasa; technical personnel from all over the country are being sent to Tibet to participate in the construction. I believe that in the next three years, the Tibet region will definitely complete the tasks specified in the first five-year plan.

I celebrate the completion of the drafting of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and wish for its full implementation.

**Wang Wenshan's Speech**

At this meeting, I listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am filled with indescribable excitement and joy. These reports are all for the purpose of ensuring that the broad laboring people of our country will never again live in poverty, for building a happy life for ourselves and our descendants, and for gradually leading our country to a beautiful socialist society. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support these reports and am determined to strive for the fulfillment of the various tasks set out in these reports.

I am a worker in the machinery manufacturing industry, and I am particularly happy about the tasks for the machinery manufacturing industry set out in the first five-year plan. The draft of the first five-year plan points out: "The machinery manufacturing industry is the leading force for the technological transformation of the national economy." In the first five-year plan, the state requires us to produce and manufacture a large number of high-quality, low-cost mechanical equipment and metal-cutting machine tools of the latest technology to meet the needs of many newly built and expanded industrial, transportation, and other enterprises, and to improve the technological level of the machinery manufacturing industry. This task is arduous, but we have the confidence to complete it. Because we have the correct leadership of the Party and the people's government, the selfless assistance of the great Soviet government and Soviet experts in material and technology, and especially the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers to build a better life for themselves. We can definitely overcome all difficulties and ensure the completion of the task. This can also be proven by the work of the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory. Our factory was a backward enterprise with extremely outdated equipment that could not produce complete machine tools at the time of liberation. Under the leadership of the Party, we overcame various difficulties and soon began formal production of belt lathes and fully geared lathes. Since 1953, when the first five-year plan began to be implemented, we have gradually manufactured Soviet-style planers and new lathes such as the 1D63 and 1D65. We are still manufacturing these new products while expanding and producing. Now, with the selfless help of Soviet experts, our factory will soon complete the expansion task. In the future, we plan to mass-produce the 1A62 type Soviet lathes, which are urgently needed by the machinery manufacturing industry, and have already successfully tested and started small-batch production. These facts fully demonstrate that the workers of the machinery manufacturing industry, under the leadership of the Party, can fully mobilize their labor enthusiasm and creativity, learn from the Soviet Union, improve technology, and are able to complete the tasks set out in the first five-year plan.

However, we must not be complacent. We should see that our tasks are very arduous, and there are many shortcomings and errors in our work. Take our factory as an example. Due to low technical level and lack of enterprise management experience, in the production alone, we caused the country to lose and waste 170 million yuan of wealth in the first half of this year, of which 67 million yuan was wasted on defective products, 58 million yuan was lost due to stoppages, and 40 million yuan was wasted on materials and tools; in product quality, there are still many shortcomings. As for the basic construction and machine installation of the factory, the waste is even greater. If we do not overcome these shortcomings and errors, it will inevitably affect the completion of the state plan.

Now, our factory, according to the instructions of the Party and the state economic organs, has launched a production and cost-saving campaign. The production and cost-saving plan we formulated is to increase production by 7% and reduce costs by 7% for the 1D63 lathe by the end of this year; to increase production by 100% and reduce costs by 20% for the 1A62 type lathe, which is starting small-batch production; to improve the quality of all products, reduce the loss and waste of defective products by 35%; and to reduce the loss and waste of stoppages. In total, we can save the country 410 million yuan of wealth by the end of this year.

To ensure the completion of the state plan and the production and cost-saving plan, according to the first five-year plan of the state and the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, I am determined to work together with all the workers of our factory to do the following:

1. Seriously learn from Soviet advanced experience and conscientiously implement Soviet expert suggestions to improve technical level. Currently, our technical level is very low. Some of the production equipment and technical safety equipment provided by the Soviet Union, we still do not know how to use, and even before formal production, we have damaged the machines. Improving technology is our current important task. The only effective way to improve technology is to seriously learn and implement Soviet technical materials, especially to conscientiously implement the complete set of process specifications designed by the Soviet Union for our factory and to strictly follow the suggestions of Soviet experts. By improving the technical level, we can continuously improve product quality, continuously improve labor productivity, and reduce personal and equipment accidents.

2. Improve enterprise management according to the principles of socialist enterprise management, strengthen management, and improve management level. The Soviet Union has helped our factory with a complete set of organizational design and has Soviet experts directly guiding. However, we have not fully utilized these favorable conditions to establish a regular management system. Currently, there are many phenomena of no one being responsible in technology and materials, the production plan is not sound, and the preparation work for production is not paid enough attention to, resulting in low product quality, many defective products, serious losses and waste, as well as stoppages, rush production, etc. In the future, we must strictly follow the organizational design, establish a sound responsibility system, strengthen plan management and technical management, and implement the economic accounting system. I am a manager of a workshop, and I am determined to rely on the masses, to issue various plan indicators to the sections and individuals month by month, to gradually implement the economic accounting of the teams, and at the same time to establish the system of making day and night shift production plans, to strengthen the preparation work before production, and to gradually achieve rhythmic production.

3. Widely carry out labor competitions. Around solving key production problems, encourage the masses to submit rationalization suggestions, timely summarize and promote advanced experience, especially to learn Soviet advanced experience in a planned way; mobilize the masses to carry out criticism from the bottom up regularly to supervise the implementation of production plans, safety technical measures plans, and living welfare measures plans, and to fight against all phenomena of loss and waste and bureaucratic work style. Also, mobilize the workers to be vigilant in labor competitions, to prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries, to expose and report counter-revolutionaries at any time, so that these villains have no place to hide.

I am determined to learn from the masses humbly and lead the masses to do these works well at my post to ensure the overfulfillment of the state plan.

**Xie Jueying's Speech**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the control of the Yellow River flood and the development of Yellow River water resources, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now, let me briefly speak on the relief work in state organs since the first session of the First National People's Congress.

At the first session of the First National People's Congress, I said that the floods of the Yangtze River and Huai River in 1954 were the worst in nearly a hundred years, and our flood control and rescue achievements were unprecedented in history. When we were engaged in relief and restoration work in the flood-stricken areas, these areas were hit by an unusually severe cold wave and heavy snow in winter. The Huai River, Han River, and even Dongting Lake were frozen, and water and land transportation were blocked by ice and snow, making it impossible to continue levee repair and agricultural and sideline production. Many houses were collapsed by the snow, and winter crops were frozen to death. This was a disaster upon a disaster, which aggravated the spring and summer famines this year. However, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the joint efforts of the broad cadres and masses, and the unified leadership of the people's government, the disaster, although extremely severe, was finally overcome by us. The lives of the people in the disaster-stricken areas were protected, and their production was restored. According to reports, in the provinces of Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi, which were severely affected by water disasters, except for the temporary shelters that need to be rebuilt after the houses were washed away by the water, there are no signs of disaster. The dikes have been repaired, draft animals, farm tools, and seeds are basically sufficient; the people have food and clothing; and the production enthusiasm is good.

Why were we able to achieve such results? Firstly, the Party and the people's government correctly implemented the disaster relief policy, and the people of the whole country supported it unanimously. The state allocated 196 million yuan for relief this year, and together with the 400 million yuan allocated after the great flood last year, a total of 4 billion yuan was allocated; the loans allocated to the flood-stricken provinces also reached 1.8 billion yuan. On the one hand, relief was provided to the famine-stricken people, and the necessary materials for life were supplied; on the other hand, seeds and draft animals were transported to the disaster-stricken areas to solve the difficulties in spring farming production. The draft animals collected and transported to the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui alone reached 1 million head; to ensure timely farming, in addition to transporting materials by train and ship, with the assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, landing boats were also used to rush the materials. In Hubei Province, 450,000 farm tools were repaired and supplemented for the disaster-stricken people in 31 counties, restoring them to 70% to 80% of the original number before the disaster. Due to the timely arrival of materials and manpower for dike construction, the 399 million cubic meters of dikes were completed before spring farming. The economic departments of the state invested 3.35 billion yuan in Anhui, Hebei, Henan, and other provinces in the winter and spring of this year for pre-purchase, purchase, and processing, which promoted the development of sideline production in the disaster-stricken areas. At the same time, the state also implemented a serious reduction and exemption of agricultural taxes in the disaster-stricken areas. The total amount of agricultural taxes reduced and exempted nationwide reached 6 billion jin, accounting for 15% of the total amount to be levied. The target for the autumn agricultural tax collection in Hubei Province was 14.59 billion jin, and 7.1 billion jin were reduced and exempted after the disaster. In Anhui Province, it was 11.37 billion jin, and 3.77 billion jin were reduced and exempted after the disaster. The agricultural taxes of the disaster-stricken farmers were reduced and exempted, but the grain transported to the disaster-stricken areas was continuously supplied. Therefore, the people gratefully said: "A flood disaster that has not occurred in a hundred years, a good government that has not occurred in a thousand years."

Secondly, the efforts of cadres at all levels, especially grassroots cadres, activists, and the masses. After completing the flood control and rescue work and the large-scale relocation of disaster-stricken people, they immediately launched an unremitting and heroic struggle against the cold wave and heavy snow. Tens of thousands of cadres led the masses to break the ice, sweep the snow, build bridges, and restore water and land transportation, transporting the materials needed by the disaster-stricken people to the disaster-stricken areas. They visited each village and household to provide relief, distributed clothes, and repaired and rebuilt houses. In the New Court Township of Dongxu County, Anhui Province, the Communist Party branch secretary Jiang Xishan, who had been on the levee day and night during the flood control, led the disaster-stricken people to open wasteland on the mountain, and continued to work even when he was ill; this time, he visited each village and household to provide emergency relief in the snow, crawling on the ice and snow pits, and did not retreat, and he handed over the relief funds given to him by the masses to others. In the Huashan area of Yangqiao District, Tongcheng County, the cadres carried clothes and food on their backs to the mountains to provide emergency relief. On the first day, due to heavy snow and steep mountains, they did not climb up, but on the second day, the cadres, hand in hand, braved the difficulties and finally climbed up the mountain to rescue the disaster-stricken people who had run out of food on the mountaintop. Vice Township Head Feng Shaobin of Minzhu Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, crossed a 15-mile ice lake, fell more than ten times, and his clothes were frozen solid, but he still insisted on delivering grain to the disaster-stricken people. After the cold wave passed, they selflessly helped the disaster-stricken people with draft animals, seeds, and farming plans, developed sideline industries, distributed relief grain and funds, and many district and township cadres did not rest during the Spring Festival. Due to these cadres themselves being laboring people, the more difficult the times, the closer they were to the people, sharing hardships and working tirelessly, thus uniting the masses and arousing their enthusiasm. According to the "History of Chinese Famine Relief" published by the Commercial Press: in 1931, the water level in Hankou was more than 2 meters lower than in 1954, and 3.7 million people died; from 1927 to 1929, there were no major disasters in three years, and 10 million people died; while in 1954, the number of people drowned and crushed was only one-thousandth of the number of deaths in 1931. According to historical records, places that suffered such major disasters often took several years or even decades to recover, while we recovered in a few months. These achievements were made on the one hand due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the superiority of the people's political power, and on the other hand, they are inseparable from the efforts of cadres at all levels of the Party, government, and military, especially grassroots cadres. At the time when the flood relief work has been completed, we would like to express our greetings and thanks to the cadres who participated in the flood control and rescue work and the restoration of production work! We would like to express our greetings and thanks to the people who struggled hard! To the comrades who sacrificed their lives for flood control and rescue and other relief work, eternal glory!

Thirdly, the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. From July last year to June this year, this grain year, 10.6 billion jin of grain was supplied to the disaster-stricken areas, and 1.4 billion jin of seeds were supplied to the disaster-stricken areas. What astonishing figures! The provinces that suffered from water disasters usually had surplus grain to transport out in normal years, but now they all need to transport in large quantities. The grain transported in was transported over long distances, requiring a lot of effort. If the state had not implemented the policy of planned purchase and planned supply, even if there were relief funds, grain could not be bought, and the disaster-stricken people would still die. If the state had not controlled grain, relying on grain merchants to transport, at least half of the relief funds would be exploited by private merchants, and the disaster-stricken people would not know how many would die. Now, no matter how tense the disaster situation is, the grain price remains stable, and grain can be delivered to the disaster-stricken people on time and in the prescribed amount. The disaster-stricken people said: "Even if the dikes are breached, the price of rice does not rise. Only the Communist Party's leadership and the implementation of unified purchase and sale can achieve this." This fact once again proves the correctness and greatness of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

Fourthly, the provinces affected by water disasters attach great importance to the issuance and management of relief funds. In the issuance work, the principle of "leadership control and democratic evaluation combined" is generally implemented. Hunan Province divided the disaster-stricken households in the entire disaster area into fully subsidized households, half-subsidized and half-loaned households, and fully loaned households, and provided relief or loans accordingly. When issuing, cadres first grasped the general situation, proposed preliminary opinions, and then handed them over to the masses for evaluation, and then the township People's Congress reviewed and approved the cases, and reported to the district for approval. Jiangsu Province's issuance: 1. Layer-by-layer investigation to know the situation; 2. Layer-by-layer communication to explain the policy; 3. Layer-by-layer production planning to combine relief with production. The evaluation method is to first select some households as standard households, and then self-report and mutual evaluation until the masses are satisfied, and then report to the district for approval. In the management of relief funds, many provinces have established a financial management system of "special personnel, special funds, and special accounts." The relief standards of Hunan and Jiangsu provinces are controlled by the county, the township is responsible for evaluation, and the district is responsible for review and issuance. The banking institutions and supply and marketing cooperatives of the district regularly issue funds and grain. Due to the implementation of these methods, the phenomena of accumulation, misappropriation, embezzlement, and waste of relief funds have been greatly reduced.

The relief work this year still has many shortcomings. These shortcomings are: while focusing on the severely disaster-stricken areas, the lightly disaster-stricken areas are often neglected. While focusing on large areas of water disasters, some disaster-stricken areas in certain provinces are often neglected. Therefore, the relief work there is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and even squeezed out by other work; the issuance of relief funds is not treated as a detailed work to be done among the masses, and the issuance is not timely or appropriate, and the phenomena of accumulation and misappropriation still occur. Therefore, some areas still have some things that should not have happened. Although these are individual cases and have been immediately checked and remedied after being discovered, it is not appropriate for the main department in charge of relief work—the Ministry of the Interior—to have not grasped the situation in advance and issued warnings to local authorities and carried out work supervision. This must be corrected in the future.

The urban relief work has also achieved considerable results in recent years. The phenomenon of many beggars, prostitutes, thieves, and vagabonds left by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in cities has been basically eliminated, and the phenomenon of serious poverty and unemployment has been gradually reduced year by year. In recent years, we have taken in 375,000 beggars, prostitutes, thieves, vagabonds, and helpless elderly and orphans, and after rehabilitation and reform, we have resettled 256,000 of them through job introduction, self-reliance, and repatriation. For the poor who lack labor, we have carried out regular and temporary relief, and for the temporarily unemployed, we have also carried out necessary relief. For general poor people, we have helped them to engage in production as much as possible. According to statistics from nine provinces including Guangdong and Fujian, and 32 cities including Beijing and Tianjin, 570,000 poor people have been organized to participate in production with the help of the government. The business expenses spent by the state on urban relief work each year are approximately more than 50 million yuan. With the development of the state's economic construction, the increase in the number of employed people, and the gradual reduction in the number of people needing relief year by year, 2 million people needed relief in 1952, 1.2 million people in 1953, and 900,000 people in 1954.

But the phenomenon of poverty and unemployment left over from the old society needs a considerable period of time to be completely solved, relying on the gradual development of the state's socialist construction. Although we have achieved many results in urban relief work in recent years, we still need to make great efforts in the future.

**Zhang Youyu's Speech**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the comprehensive plan for the control of the Yellow River flood and the development of Yellow River water resources, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on grain planning supply, streamlining and saving, primary and secondary education, and urban vagabonds based on the situation in Beijing.

Regarding the issue of grain planning supply: The past grain sales work in Beijing was loosely managed, with many loopholes and a lot of waste. The speculation and profiteering of speculators were quite serious. From the perspective of the situation in the suburbs, the main problem was that the management was too loose rather than too tight. Many households that should not have been supplied were supplied, and those that should have been supplied less were supplied more. For example, in the Changdian Township of Dongbei, more than 30 surplus households and self-sufficient households bought 2,700 jin of grain. Therefore, the grain sales volume from July 1954 to June 1955 exceeded the state's planned quota. This year, from January to April, the population increased by 14.94% compared to the same period last year, while the grain sales volume increased by 28.45%. The increase in grain sales volume exceeded the population growth. This indicates that some grain was wasted, hoarded, or speculated. To eliminate waste and leakage and save grain, it is necessary to strengthen the management of grain planning supply. In the past few months, in addition to vigorously carrying out propaganda, we first implemented the system of formulating monthly grain use plans for collective dining units such as organs, schools, and factories and mines. Due to the responsibility of most leaders and the support of the masses, the implementation results were quite effective. Starting from June, we also implemented the method of universal household verification and supply for general residents. Now, the grain sales volume has been reduced, and the grain consumption per household and per person does not feel insufficient, and many households are still quite comfortable. In addition, the population of Beijing has increased rapidly in recent years, increasing by 75% compared to the time of liberation, and just from January to April this year, it increased by 150,000. Among these newly added population, there are many who have land or business in their original places but have nothing to do in Beijing (there are also some escaped landlords, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries). If this continues, it will breed a batch of parasites and layabouts, which is not good for the country or for themselves. They should return to their original places to engage in production, participate in socialist construction, reduce urban grain consumption, and avoid the many difficulties caused by excessive concentration of urban population. We plan to reduce the grain sales volume from July 1955 to June 1956 from the state's planned quota of 15.5 billion jin by 3 billion jin. Saving grain and verifying supply is beneficial not only to the country but also to every thrifty citizen who lives a frugal life, and it is only detrimental to speculators and profiteers. As long as we do a good job in propaganda and organization work and prevent deviations in the work, our plan is achievable.

Regarding the issue of streamlining and saving: First of all, the phenomena of bloated organizations, overlapping layers, large establishments, and excessive personnel exist seriously in the administrative organs and enterprises and institutions of Beijing. This is due to the fact that when we were just liberated, we "took over" the original personnel, and at the same time, some leading cadres had the idea that "the more people, the better the work can be done," and we did not control the increase of personnel strictly, plus the accumulation of work experience over the years, the personnel became proficient, and the efficiency improved, so this phenomenon became prominent. This not only greatly wasted manpower, increased administrative expenses and enterprise management costs, but also fostered the development of our already serious bureaucratism and clericalism, hindering the improvement of work. According to the instructions of the Central Government, we began to streamline the work from mid-March, and now, the streamlining of the municipal administrative departments has been completed, and the streamlining of the affiliated institutions of various municipal units and factories and mines is also underway. From the results of the streamlining of these units, some can be streamlined by one-fourth, some can be streamlined by one-third to one-half, and some can be streamlined by more than one-half. For example, in the 42 units of the municipal government system with 7,260 people, 3,144 people were streamlined, accounting for 43%, of which 22 units were streamlined by about one-half, and 2 units were streamlined by more than 60%; in the 29,614 people of the 24 affiliated institutions of the municipal level, 7,822 people were initially streamlined, accounting for 26%, and the Shijingshan Steel Plant, Power Plant, and Qinghe Woolen Mill and other three units can streamline one-fourth; the 31,000-plus employees of the 79 units under the Construction Materials Industry Bureau can streamline 10,000 people, accounting for 33%. For the handling of surplus personnel after streamlining, the measures we adopted are: in addition to sending a part to supplement other units in need, especially grassroots units, and handling the sick, elderly, and disabled separately, in factories and mines, we implement increased shifts and organized shift learning to wait for national allocation, and in administrative organs, we implement learning in batches for three months or half a year and rotating work, and once the country needs, we can use them at any time; for institutions, we adopt the methods of factories and mines or administrative organs according to their nature. In this way, although we cannot immediately reduce the number of personnel and expenses, we can improve the political, business, cultural, and technical levels of cadres and workers, thereby improving work and production. Moreover, with the expansion and development of the state's construction, we can gradually send the surplus cadres and workers in rotation to participate in the construction and achieve the goal of streamlining.

Secondly, Beijing has existed serious waste phenomena in basic construction, factories and mines, and urban construction in various aspects. Some factories' garbage piles have become "treasure troves," with steel and other materials; some construction sites even have so-called "unmanned warehouses," with building materials scattered everywhere; the 79 units under the local industry bureau had a loss of 430,000 yuan due to poor quality in the first quarter of this year; the Food Company had a loss of 405,000 jin of pigs due to disease and death from April to December last year, equivalent to the consumption of the entire city for 30 days, valued at approximately 130,000 yuan. Especially in civil construction, although there was a significant improvement from design to construction in 1954, the average labor productivity of various trades in October 1954 was 44% higher than the trial labor quota of 1953, and the construction cost was 6.8% lower than the design and budget quota issued by the state in 1954, but due to the influence of reactionary restorationism and formalism disguised as "national style," waste was still very serious. As pointed out by Vice Premier Li Fuchun: just for the "big roof" alone, the 39 buildings of various organs in Beijing wasted 5.4 million yuan. We have previously opposed the so-called "national style" according to the instructions of the Central Government and repeatedly opposed restorationism, but after the autumn of 1953, we adopted a liberal attitude towards some buildings and did not take timely and effective measures. Moreover, some staff members secretly promoted and even forced businessmen to adopt the "big roof" construction form in various ways, which is a serious mistake and should be deeply reflected upon. In the future, we will strictly implement the instructions of the State Council and the measures proposed in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report to resolutely oppose and overcome the phenomenon of waste in construction. For savings in other aspects, we have also taken a series of measures, requiring them to complete or overfulfill the indicators set by the state. For example, various factories and mines can reduce the cost by an additional 3% to 5% compared to the state plan; municipal engineering can reduce the cost by 5% to 15%.

Regarding the issue of primary and secondary education: Over the past six years, primary and secondary education in Beijing has developed significantly. In 1954, the number of students in secondary schools reached 121,000, an increase of 1.42 times compared to 1948, and the number of primary school students reached 304,340, an increase of 1.58 times compared to 1948. However, since we did not take effective measures to improve quality while developing the number of schools, in 1953, a large number of high school graduates who applied for higher education had scores below 60, and a large number of primary school graduates who applied for junior high school also failed. To change this situation, we have taken a series of measures since the second half of last year, making the improvement of quality the focus of primary and secondary education work. After a year of efforts, the teaching quality of teachers and the learning quality of students have generally improved. Teachers teach seriously, and students study seriously, and a new atmosphere has emerged in primary and secondary schools throughout the city. We believe that to further improve quality, both teachers and students must study and work hard, and the idea that one can teach well or learn well without effort and hard work is wrong. However, in the work of improving quality, we must also pay attention to the health of teachers and students and not overburden them. Although we have paid attention to this aspect, there have been many shortcomings in the implementation. The course load of students in the third grade of junior high school and above is too heavy. In addition, students' extracurricular activities are too many. This makes it impossible for students to get enough rest and affects their health. This is also something that must be corrected. Although the phenomenon of overburdening students has been alleviated, it must continue to be overcome.

Regarding the issue of urban vagabonds: Since the liberation of Beijing, we have not had time to thoroughly deal with the large number of parasitic population left by the reactionary ruling classes of previous dynasties. There are still many people who are afraid of hard work and do not want to participate in labor, as well as a batch of poison left from the old society, such as thieves, swindlers, hooligans, and local bullies, which seriously endanger social order. We believe that this is unacceptable in the construction of a socialist state, and decisive and effective measures must be taken to gradually relocate them from the capital in conjunction with the state's land reclamation plan, organize them to engage in agricultural production, and give them a reliable source of livelihood, and thoroughly reform them in the process of labor.

**Huang Huoqing's Speech**

I enthusiastically support the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country. I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, I would like to express the following opinions on the specific situation and current tasks of Tianjin, and I hope everyone will correct me.

In the construction of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country, due to economic and national defense considerations, Tianjin is not the focus of development. However, as an existing industrial base, it has the conditions and responsibility to support the socialist construction of the state. It has undertaken and will continue to make greater efforts in the future. In recent years, the working class and all laboring people of Tianjin, under the correct leadership of the Central Government, have basically completed the tasks assigned by the state, and production has exceeded the state plan year by year. However, there are also many shortcomings and problems in the work, and the two most prominent ones that should be solved immediately are: one is the issue of opposing waste and advocating thrift; the other is the issue of continuing to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries and safeguarding socialist construction.

The phenomenon of waste in basic construction, industry, commerce, and organ life in Tianjin is quite serious. The main reason for this is that our political and ideological education is insufficient. We have not made the broad cadres and workers deeply realize that the construction of socialism is a process of arduous struggle, so they do not consciously work diligently; we have not deeply propagated and educated every cadre and worker on the thought of cherishing state property and concentrating all possible material strength for the socialist construction of the state, so a sense of complacency, conservatism, and extravagant and wasteful style has grown among the cadres, lacking the necessary high sense of responsibility for state property. Next, our economic work has a relatively low level of planned management. Many leading cadres still do not understand the laws of work, have no numbers in mind, and are still quite blind. In some aspects, there is a lack of some necessary systems, or although there are systems, they are not seriously implemented. There is a lack of necessary inspection and supervision, or although there is inspection and supervision, it is not strict and tight.

Due to the above reasons, in basic construction, there has been a development of over-emphasis on surface decoration, demanding high standards, blindly increasing safety factors, and overestimating. The trend of "big roofs" has also been prevalent for a time, causing great waste. Since the establishment of the Tianjin Design Company, it has designed approximately 100 million yuan worth of projects. The most conservative estimate is that it has wasted 10% to 15%, that is, 10 million to 15 million yuan, not including the waste in the construction aspect.

In production, many enterprise leaders only pay attention to the completion of production plans and neglect comprehensive management. They manage production workshops more and pay less attention to supply and storage departments; they focus more on production value and quantity and less on cost and finance. The idea of "wide input and narrow output," the idea of "self-forgiveness" that "the enterprise is large and experience is small, and a little waste is unavoidable," and the idea that "the enterprise has many problems, and waste is not surprising" are quite common. Many factories have conservative (that is, high) original material consumption quotas, and the phenomenon of blind procurement by the supply department has caused serious accumulation of original materials and tools. Just in four relatively large machinery manufacturing factories, the surplus original materials, tools, and semi-finished products have reached 5 million yuan.

The education of workers on saving original materials is insufficient, coupled with the lack of necessary management and control, "do what you do, destroy what you do," causing great waste. The state-owned Tianjin Canned Food Factory wasted 37,000 jin of pork in just two months because the meat on the bones was not scraped clean and was thrown on the ground. The wire factory has a pile of tin in the courtyard that is as high as a small mountain, and workers have already smelted 5 tons of tin from part of the tin.

Due to the lack of some necessary systems in technical management or the lack of serious implementation of existing systems, technical control is not in place, accidents are frequent, and scrap is large, and this waste often causes great losses at once. For example, the rubber factory's formula error caused the scrapping of 7 tons of rubber at once.

The waste in private industry in the above aspects is even more serious.

In business, there is also blindness in business operations, and there is a lack of constant and detailed investigation and research on market supply and demand and people's needs. Many leading cadres have no numbers in mind and do not know the bottom line, so they blindly purchase, causing accumulation and wasting state funds. The China Department Store Tianjin Company purchased a large number of canned foods without considering sales volume, causing a large accumulation of these commodities with a preservation period, and they had to be sold at a discounted price, resulting in a loss of 230,000 yuan. On the other hand, there are many commodities that cannot be delivered on time, resulting in shortages.

In the establishment of organs and enterprises, many places, due to insufficient estimation of the future of work development, coupled with blind pursuit of large-scale, lack necessary strict control in personnel administration, resulting in bloated organizations and excessive personnel. Some factories have management personnel and non-production personnel accounting for more than 30% of the total number of the factory, and some construction sites have management personnel and non-production personnel accounting for more than 40% of the total number of workers. There are also many phenomena of pursuing grandeur and preferring to purchase high-grade equipment and supplies in organs and enterprises.

Based on the situation in Tianjin, we firmly support the Central Government's policy of advocating thrift and resolutely implement the specific measures of the Central Government on advocating thrift. In the industrial sector, we will strengthen cost and financial management and technical management, improve the technical level of workers, and study methods of saving, recycling, and substituting raw materials; in the commercial sector, we will accelerate the turnover of funds, reduce commodity circulation costs, and improve warehouse management; we will streamline the establishment and strictly prohibit extravagance and waste. In addition, we will also implement the following methods to achieve greater savings:

1. Organize the technical strength of the same industry to compare the advantages and disadvantages within the industry, summarize and promote advanced technical experience, and specifically help each factory solve technical problems. For example, the rubber industry has formulated some measures to improve quality and save raw rubber through a professional conference this year. The results of the implementation are that from January to May, 14 rubber factories saved 110,000 jin of raw rubber. If this is continued and promoted, the rubber industry can save 380,000 jin of raw rubber from June to December. This method is a step forward compared to the past promotion of advanced experience because it not only introduces but also organizes technical strength to help.

2. Organize the strength of the industrial and commercial departments together to jointly study the appropriate modification of the specifications of some products, remove unnecessary packaging, improve formulas, and save under the condition of not affecting quality. For example, stopping the production of red light sulfur blue and producing blue light sulfur blue, the New Min Chemical Factory and the North China Chemical Factory can save 8,400 yuan in the second half of this year, and the quality of dyeing is also better than before. Strengthening cooperation between enterprises can also save. For example, the Tianjin Paper Mill changed the supply of pulp to the People's Paper Mill from pulp boards to direct supply of reed pulp, which can save the cost of making pulp boards in the Tianjin Paper Mill, and the People's Paper Mill can save 17,500 yuan in the second half of this year. This method needs to be studied specifically by category.

3. Promote the team economic accounting system among the masses in a planned way. The team economic accounting system is actually a kind of team savings account, which is a simple and effective way for savings to be truly grasped by the masses, thereby effectively reducing costs. The rubber factory saved 15,600 jin of rubber in the first half of last year, and in the second half of the year, the masses controlled the consumption quota, not only made up for the deficit but also saved 11,000 jin of raw rubber. There are many such facts.

The result of implementing thrift this year is roughly calculated that all aspects of the city can save 70 million yuan for the state, and by deeply mobilizing the masses, it is possible to exceed this. But due to insufficient work, the potential for savings must still be great. We are determined to continue to work hard, to advocate thrift constantly and long-term, and to strive for the state to mobilize and accumulate more funds.

Regarding the issue of continuing to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Tianjin is an important transportation hub on the coast and the gateway to the capital. Since liberation, we have carried out the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the struggle to eliminate reactionary sects, mainly striking at those counter-revolutionaries who committed numerous crimes during the reactionary rule and could not hide from the people; but there are still a considerable number of hidden or using two-faced methods to infiltrate our ranks of counter-revolutionaries that we have not discovered and eliminated. According to the situation in Tianjin: first, there is still a considerable number of long-hidden and escaped-from-other-places counter-revolutionaries. They have mostly changed their names, forged their history, and hidden in areas with weak work foundations or complex areas. Some have already infiltrated our ranks, occupying important positions. For example, Wang Lichu, a former lieutenant colonel of the bandit Wang Fenggang's department, who was responsible for three murders, forged his history and infiltrated our ranks for four years. Hu Feng's followers Alu and Ludian also used two-faced methods to hide their illegal activities. Second, the spy and sabotage organizations of the imperialist powers led by the United States and the Kuomintang bandits have never relaxed their dispatch activities to the Tianjin area since liberation. The previously uncovered sabotage cases of Wang Mingwu, Qiao Zhendong, and Qu Hongqi are proof of this. Third, during the land reform in the suburbs, the masses were not mobilized enough, and the remnants of counter-revolutionary forces were not given a fatal blow, allowing some counter-revolutionaries to slip through the net and roam freely. Fourth, in recent years, many organs, enterprises, and schools have developed rapidly, even recruiting personnel from various places outside the province, without strict examination, and a batch of counter-revolutionaries have also infiltrated. Fifth, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for many years has left a batch of hooligans, thieves, robbers, gang leaders, swindlers, drug criminals, and smugglers in society. Some of those who should be punished have not received the punishment they deserve; some are still unrepentant, and their criminal cases are increasing. In addition, in the sharp struggle of socialist transformation, there have been cases where those who resolutely resist transformation and counter-revolutionaries combine.

The activities of these counter-revolutionaries are rampant. They target every major measure of the Communist Party and the people's government and changes in the international situation, carrying out various reactionary propaganda, spreading rumors, writing threatening letters, using various opportunities to create disturbances, and even committing murder. In factories and enterprises, they create production accidents. Their main means of sabotage are in design, planning, testing, and technical guidance, using technical authority to create errors; in the process of machine repair and installation, deliberately delaying accumulation, refusing to implement Soviet expert suggestions, violating operating procedures, or stealing economic intelligence, creating various errors such as wrong allocation, wrong transportation, wrong calculation, etc. Many criminal offenders are closely linked with counter-revolutionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. These criminal offenders and counter-revolutionaries are the ready-made supporting force and reliable objects of absorption for the spies sent by the United States and the Kuomintang. Some of them were originally in collusion with them.

The situation in Tianjin over the past few years has proven that the enemy does not disappear with the increasing victory and consolidation of our revolutionary power. On the contrary, it is precisely because the struggle is sharp and deep that they have to make desperate struggles. When the general line was announced and the people of the whole country began to carry out large-scale socialist construction, their activities became even more rampant. If we do not adopt the policy of resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, it will have serious consequences. We firmly support the government's measures to arrest Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, and we firmly support the elimination of all hidden counter-revolutionaries within us.

However, there is a very dangerous complacency among some cadres, forgetting that imperialism is still surrounding us, not seeing the sharpening of class struggle at present, and not seeing the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. This complacency is a manifestation of political rightism. Some counter-revolutionaries have been found to have sent threatening letters for a long time, but they have not been arrested. Some counter-revolutionaries attempted to kill public security personnel, but they have not been arrested and sentenced. The Hu Feng faction has been rampant in Tianjin for a long time, but we only felt something was wrong, thinking it was a matter of literary thought and personal style, and did not investigate deeply; although there were suspicions about Alu's history, it was not seriously investigated. This rightist manifestation will obviously encourage counter-revolutionary sabotage activities and is not beneficial to the people. We have some cadres who think that the power is in our hands, and the Kuomintang bandits have all fled to Taiwan, and a few remaining counter-revolutionaries cannot cause a rebellion, so they become complacent, which is very wrong. According to the cases uncovered in Tianjin, counter-revolutionaries have sent high-explosive explosives and poisons into our important enterprise buildings and assassinated Party and government cadres through various relationships. If we do not heighten our vigilance, we will definitely suffer losses. Therefore, the main task at present is to correct rightist thoughts and implement the policy of resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Of course, our policy towards counter-revolutionaries has always been a combination of suppression and leniency. The Party and the government have never said that leniency should also be applied to those counter-revolutionaries who are firmly opposed to the people, because that would be tantamount to undermining the interests of the people; while for those whose crimes are not heavy and who are willing to repent, if they are not given the opportunity to reform, it is also not beneficial to the cause of the people. Our leniency is not unprincipled indulgence, and our suppression is not based on subjective emotions. Both leniency and suppression are completely for the interests of the people.

In a city like Tianjin, advocating thrift and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are the main links for us to support and safeguard socialist construction. We are determined to continue to work hard, to deeply implement and persistently carry out these two tasks, to ensure the completion of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country!

**Yang Siyi's Speech**

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on this plan, as well as the reports of other responsible comrades.

Our five-year plan is a major step in implementing the general task of the transitional period of the state, a specific road for our country to move towards socialism, a banner of the common interests of the people of the whole country and the highest interests, and a harbinger of the happy life of the descendants of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. The implementation of this plan requires the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the iron unity and efforts of the 600 million people of the whole country. After the completion of this plan, our country will not only be politically stronger, but also economically stronger.

The great five-year plan will soon be decided by our congress, and now the biggest task in front of us is how to mobilize the 600 million people of the whole country to work wholeheartedly for the implementation of the guidelines and indicators set out in this plan. To implement the great five-year plan, both hard work and tenacious struggle are needed, and all attempts to disrupt peaceful construction must be crushed, and all arguments that deviate from the focus of construction and attempt to shift the target or relax the will of the people to build the economy must be opposed.

The allocation plan of basic construction investment in various departments stipulated in the five-year plan is a concrete embodiment of the guiding principle of state key construction, and it is also in line with the specific situation of our country at present; no one has forgotten that for nearly a hundred years, the reason why the imperialists dared to invade and oppress our country so arrogantly and unreasonably, and even today, they do not restore our legitimate rights in the United Nations and dare to occupy our territory of Taiwan, is not because of any other reason, but because our industry is too backward; although in the short five years since the liberation of the whole country, the development of our industry has surpassed the past few decades, but we have not changed the backward face of our industry, that is to say, our heavy industry still cannot meet the demand for self-manufacturing cars, tractors, airplanes, and tanks; only after the completion of all 156 key projects designed by the Soviet Union in the first five-year plan, we can say that our country has laid the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. From this, it can be seen that the idea that we can invest more funds in agriculture or other aspects is inappropriate, and it will inevitably affect the implementation of the guiding principle of state key construction.

Zhejiang is basically an agricultural production area. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report mentions: "To build socialism, we must solve the contradiction between small peasant economy and socialist industrialization," "to overcome the contradiction that the development of agriculture lags far behind the development of industry, is a major task of the five-year plan," "the development of agriculture is the basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan." These instructions, on the one hand, make us know what we should do to implement the five-year plan, and on the other hand, make us deeply feel the greatness of our own responsibility.

Compared with the old liberated areas, Zhejiang is a new area with a relatively weak work foundation, and we also lack experience in national construction, especially economic construction, which will inevitably bring many difficulties in completing the arduous tasks assigned by the state in the future. Since the liberation of Zhejiang, over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the people's government and the Central Committee of the Party, we have basically completed the tasks assigned by the state. If we make fewer mistakes in our future work and can bravely overcome the errors and shortcomings that may arise in our work, then we will be able to better complete the tasks assigned by the state to Zhejiang Province.

Zhejiang Province has good natural conditions and great potential in all aspects of production. For example, the province currently has 26 million mu of fertile paddy fields, 70 million mu of mountainous areas that have not been fully developed, 5,000 square nautical miles of large fishing grounds, silk, tea, cotton, hemp, salt, and nationally famous Huangyan honey oranges, Jinhua ham, Shaoxing yellow wine, etc. In the past few years, due to our lack of in-depth understanding of the economic situation of the whole province and lack of comprehensive planning and control of the economic development work of the whole province, it has affected the development of various projects and agricultural production, especially some economic crops, which is not fast enough. In the future, we will, according to the direction indicated by the five-year plan and various increase production measures, in combination with the specific situation of Zhejiang Province, continue to implement the basic policy of rural work centered on mutual aid and cooperation, establish the idea of comprehensive production development that not only does a good job in grain production but also combines the development of other crops and by-products, and not only continues to strengthen the work and production in the plain areas but also actively develops the economy and marine fishery production in the mountainous areas. The province currently has 38,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with 18.6% of the total households participating in the cooperatives. The superiority of the cooperatives has gradually been recognized by the broad masses of farmers. The households participating in the mutual aid teams account for about 60% of the total households, so the conditions for further cooperation are completely available. The grain production per mu ranges from over 100 jin to over 1,000 jin, with an average yield of 440 jin. This shows that as long as we summarize the experience of high-yield areas well, seriously learn from the advanced experience of neighboring areas, and further improve the unit area yield on the basis of cooperation, there is great hope, and it is also possible to expand the sowing area and appropriately increase the cultivated area. Based on the above situation, we have the confidence to complete the various indicators set by the state. If we work better, we may even exceed it. Of course, in the implementation of the above tasks, we will encounter various difficulties, but we are determined to overcome them.

This meeting is a great meeting of historical significance, and the spirit of this meeting will definitely produce great political power among the people of the whole country. But we must also pay attention to the fact that when we are happy, the enemy is there hating us. Therefore, we must always be vigilant and fight against the conspiracy and sabotage activities of all enemies, let the enemy tremble in front of our socialist construction victory!

**Rong Yiren's Speech**

I fully agree with and support the reports of the leaders.

I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and I am very satisfied. The full implementation of this plan will bring about a major change in our national economy, and it is a plan that lays the initial foundation for transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrialized country, and it is also a plan for the people of the whole country to gradually move towards a happy and prosperous life. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "The completion of the industrial production plan in five years mainly depends on the existing enterprises of our country." I am a private entrepreneur in the cotton textile and flour industries, and I am honored to be able to contribute a little strength in this plan. I will definitely, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the working class, improve the management of the enterprises I operate, advocate thrift, oppose waste, and produce products with "good quality, many varieties, and clever prices" to meet the needs of the people; at the same time, I will hand over the profits to the state according to law, buy national bonds, invest in the interior, and support the construction; and I will also actively assist the state in training and cultivating technical personnel to meet the needs of construction; with these actions, I will strive to achieve the public-private joint operation of enterprises and accept the socialist transformation of the state towards enterprises and individuals.

When our people of the whole country are working hard and enthusiastically carrying out the cause of socialist construction, the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits are unwilling, and they continue to send spies to carry out sabotage activities, which can be clearly seen from the materials revealed in the newspapers. We businessmen, in general, are very indignant about the conspiracy and sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and support the government's punishment of them, but we are not enough in learning from the lessons, raising revolutionary vigilance, and some are not enough. Some people are complacent, thinking that after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, counter-revolutionaries have been eliminated, and have not seen that counter-revolutionaries are still hiding in the country, and the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits are continuously sending spies to infiltrate the mainland. Some people are indifferent, thinking that the smashing of the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance is the Communist Party's business, the elimination of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the business of the literary and artistic circles, and the elimination of spies is the business of the public security and judicial departments, and have not seen that the activities of counter-revolutionaries will disrupt our national construction, and have not seen that counter-revolutionaries will infiltrate the business community, hide, and take advantage of the weaknesses of the business community to lure, and it is very likely that those businessmen who do not want to accept socialist transformation will degenerate into counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the complacency towards counter-revolutionaries is objectively a tolerance of counter-revolutionaries and is not beneficial to the cause of socialist construction.

From specific examples, the activities of counter-revolutionaries are rampant. In Shanghai, a paper mill had the screws of the electric shed loosened, and the shaft of a 200-horsepower motor was damaged and installed in the motor. In a machinery factory, counter-revolutionaries attempted to put "mountain pine" in the food, which is a highly toxic chemical, to poison the workers. In an electrical machinery factory, a very important generator was repaired for a certain factory and shipped out, but when it was installed, it was found that screws, scissors, and putty were placed inside, attempting to sabotage the generator. In a cotton mill, there were more than 20 fires in the carding room in one month. If the carding room burns down, the mill cannot produce. Fortunately, these cases were all solved in time, avoiding serious losses. In a guild, four counter-revolutionaries infiltrated nine officials. On October 10 last year, they still celebrated the so-called "Double Ten Festival." In an enterprise, six out of seven were counter-revolutionaries. From the perspective of personnel, for example, in the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the guild, from the time of liberation to now, 261 people have been arrested for counter-revolutionary cases, of which 63 people served as chairmen and vice chairmen of the guild; and 153 working staff have been arrested. The proportion of these two categories is approximately 5%, which is not small. They are either reactionary officials, evil landlords, or professional spies. Some of them are active on the surface and engage in conspiracies and tricks behind the scenes. In short, these facts fully illustrate the harmfulness of counter-revolutionaries, disrupting factories, disrupting production, disrupting public order, and also disrupting our construction, which should alert us seriously. We must be sober-minded to assist the government in thoroughly eliminating all counter-revolutionaries.

We fully support the decision of the Standing Committee to arrest and try the counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. As a businessman and a member of a democratic party, we must speak the truth, do honest work, raise objections, correct mistakes, be careful in appointing personnel, conduct strict examinations, seriously study policies, explain and propagate to those who do not understand policies, help each other, actively accept reform, walk the path of socialist construction, and not let counter-revolutionaries take advantage of our weaknesses to find loopholes; at the same time, we must trace the source of rumors, investigate the details of accidents, expose and report bad elements, and not let counter-revolutionaries hide and conceal themselves in our ranks. To fully implement the first five-year plan of our country, to safeguard the fruits of our revolutionary victory, let us unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and not let one slip through!

**Jiang Guangna's Speech**

I fully support the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China, fully agree with the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and the report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, fully agree with the report of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The guiding principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry in the first five-year plan is completely correct. From the perspective of the textile industry, it is the same. Only when heavy industry develops can the textile industry have a source of new-type equipment, and the technology of the textile industry can be continuously improved. At the same time, because the raw materials of the textile industry all need to be supplied by agricultural production. Without the supply of a large number of agricultural machinery and a large number of chemical fertilizers by heavy industry, it is also impossible to do so. As for the development of dyes and man-made fibers, synthetic fibers necessary for the textile industry, if there is no development of basic chemical industry, it is also difficult. Therefore, giving priority to the development of heavy industry is precisely to open up a broad way for the development of agriculture and light industry.

Our textile industry has developed rapidly in the past five years. However, due to the improvement of people's lives, textile products still cannot fully meet the needs of the people. Therefore, in the five-year construction plan, the development of the textile industry has been considered with a relatively high indicator. After repeated research and balancing, it was felt that there was a lack of a reliable foundation, and the basic reason was the shortage of raw material supply, so the originally high indicator was appropriately compressed to both meet the needs of people's lives and meet the possible supply of raw materials, and to be in line with the state's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. If the indicator is set too low, it will also affect people's lives. This shows that the development speed of the textile industry should be considered comprehensively. Otherwise, it is easy to have deviations. Therefore, I think the development speed of the textile industry stipulated in the five-year plan is appropriate.

To overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the textile industry, in addition to increasing production as much as possible in agriculture, our textile industry department also has a heavy responsibility. This is, on the one hand, to save raw materials as much as possible, and on the other hand, to find ways to open up new resources, mainly to study the use of various fibers that can be used, and to study various substitute raw materials. In the past, we have studied the use of cotton stalks and banana stems to weave gunny sacks, the blending of ramie and cotton, the interweaving of silk and wool, etc., although we have achieved some results, but these works are just the beginning, and there are still some problems in technology, and we need to make greater efforts in the future.

We fully agree with the suggestions of some representatives that in the future, we should actively develop the man-made fiber and synthetic fiber industries. The first five-year plan has planned to build a modern man-made fiber factory with an annual output of 10,000 tons, and to restore the Anle and Andong man-made fiber factories, laying the foundation for the development of the man-made fiber industry in the future. At present, the main problem in the development of the man-made fiber industry, in addition to insufficient technical conditions, is also not without problems in raw material supply. Because we have only successfully studied wood pulp that can be used as raw material for man-made fibers in the past, and wood pulp needs pine as raw material, this kind of wood is also not very abundant in our country. Therefore, to develop the man-made fiber industry, we must also actively find ways to open up new raw material resources. Now, in addition to the successful trial of waste cotton and cottonseed lint, we are continuing to experiment with bamboo pulp, sugarcane residue, and other fibers. If these experiments can be successful and the economic effect is high, it can create better conditions for the future development of the man-made fiber industry in our country. As for the synthetic fiber industry, it can also achieve certain results through the efforts of all aspects in the process of the gradual development of heavy industry.

To concentrate on the development of heavy industry, our textile industry, in addition to completing its own plan to appropriately meet the growing needs of the people for textile products, also has the important task of accumulating funds for the state. Therefore, we must strongly oppose waste and establish a strict savings system. At present, the phenomenon of waste is still quite serious in our textile industry department. If we cannot overcome the phenomenon of waste and tap the potential of all aspects to accumulate funds for the state, it will also affect the state's completion of the five-year plan.

The waste in the textile industry department is reflected in basic construction, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out, first of all: the production construction and non-production construction are not well distinguished. For production construction, it is necessary to reach a certain level of modernization, of course, it should also be practical and not too far from reality. But we have many comrades who blindly pursue the so-called "socialist standard" for non-production construction, everything must be big, new, many, good, and complete, dormitories, canteens, nurseries, and children's schools all require high standards, which is wrong. In the past few new factories we built, the standards of living facilities were high, and the waste was also great. Next, there are also many shortcomings in construction and management. Such as insufficient research on construction projects, lack of correct quotas and standards, plans are not compiled in line with reality, and attention is not paid to the management of materials and labor force. Therefore, what should be saved cannot be carried out. Next, we have not specified clear items and certain standards for the construction expenses of various preparatory units, and have not carried out strict control, so the use of construction expenses by various preparatory units is also not restricted. We have listed an item of greening in the investment of new factories, the main purpose of which is to plant some trees around the factory to avoid wind and sand. But some units sent people to buy rare flowers and trees everywhere. Some units used construction expenses to build fountains, and even listed the goldfish in the pool in the basic construction investment. Some preparatory units, as soon as they were established, wanted to buy cars, buy sofas, buy radios, buy carpets, and all of them wanted to be beautiful. Some factories even thought that the 160 yuan sofas they made were not good, and sent people to Tianjin to buy leather sofas. In addition, some preparatory units also blindly purchased things, regardless of whether they could use them now. For example, with only 20 barbers, 104 razors and scissors were bought, and 128 knives were bought, and someone said they could be used for 40 years. These all show that many of our comrades do not understand the meaning of saving state funds, nor do they understand that the state's construction still needs to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle in the past. There are also many comrades who have indeed cultivated a luxurious mentality, been infected with the wind of extravagance, and forgotten the past hard and simple style. This is very dangerous and should alert us. Recently, we have re-studied according to the spirit of advocating overall savings, used the methods of reducing or postponing projects that can be deferred, lowering construction standards and costs, appropriately reducing possible reductions in dormitories and some welfare facilities, and reducing basic construction preparation fees and material preparation fees, which can save 90 million yuan for the investment in the last three years of the first five-year plan. It can be seen that the potential for savings in the basic construction of the textile industry is very great. We should continue to dig this potential.

The waste in the textile industry department also exists in production. First of all, the quality of the products is not good. Cotton yarn has many impurities, cotton cloth has many black and white spots on the surface, dyed and finished cloth has poor color fastness, high shrinkage rate, and printed cloth has dull colors and monotonous patterns. The reasons for these defects, in addition to the influence of the quality of raw materials to a certain extent, mainly lie in the fact that there are still many shortcomings in technical management work. It must be recognized that poor quality affects the service life, and this waste is difficult to calculate. Next, the attention to saving raw materials is not enough, whether it is cotton, wool, hemp, or silk textile enterprises. For example, the consumption of raw cotton per piece of yarn (mixed piece) in national cotton textile factories across the country was 388.72 jin on average last year, but the highest reached 399.92 jin, which is 11.2 jin higher than the average consumption of cotton. If the factories with more cotton consumption can catch up with the factories with less cotton consumption, we can save more cotton. In addition, there is a great potential for saving materials, coal, and electricity. Next, there is also a great potential for saving in the use of labor and enterprise management fees, workshop expenses, etc. Currently, our enterprises generally lack strict quotas, and there are too many non-production personnel. The high and low of enterprise management fees and workshop expenses among various enterprises are also very different. For example, in the first quarter of this year, Shanghai National Cotton Mill No. 15 was 68.71% higher than Tianjin National Cotton Mill No. 4, and in the same region with the same equipment, in the first quarter, Qingdao National Cotton Mill No. 7 was 49.62% higher than National Cotton Mill No. 3. In this regard, if the enterprises with high management fees can do the same as the enterprises with low expenses, more funds can be saved.

To advocate thrift and oppose waste in production enterprises, it is necessary to establish the idea of economic accounting and the spirit of meticulous calculation among all enterprise management personnel. The economic accounting system of enterprises must be gradually strengthened. Recently, we have roughly calculated that if the raw materials can be supplied according to the plan this year and the production plan is not changed, the state-owned textile enterprises (including the supply and marketing system) can save about 20 million yuan in financial costs, and save about 40 million yuan in working capital. If all our enterprises can be meticulous in all aspects and strive for savings, the number of savings will definitely be greater than these numbers.

In our textile industry system, there are many people who emphasize that saving raw materials will definitely affect product quality. Of course, raw materials and quality are not completely unrelated. However, the view that absolutely opposes saving raw materials and ensuring quality is completely wrong. What we mean by saving cotton is mainly, on the basis of ensuring quality, to require each enterprise to waste no effective fibers of cotton, and it is not to remove the impurities that should be removed, nor is it to engage in speculation on raw materials, or even to cut corners, causing greater waste. What we mean by ensuring product quality is mainly to strengthen technical leadership, strengthen enterprise management, and rationally use raw materials. In fact, if technical leadership is not strengthened and enterprise management is not strengthened, even if more raw materials are consumed, product quality cannot be guaranteed.

The serious shortcomings in the basic construction and production of the textile industry department are mainly due to the fact that our leadership has not checked strictly, supervised forcefully, lacked the necessary strict system or the system is not perfect, especially the political and ideological work has not been done well. In the textile industry cadres, there is a quite common sense of arrogance and complacency, being satisfied with the existing achievements, not learning from others humbly, and lacking the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. This sense of arrogance and complacency, if not overcome, all work cannot be done well. Therefore, to successfully complete the five-year plan, all cadres in the textile industry department must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, fully mobilize the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, so as to be able to correct their own shortcomings at any time and improve their work.

**Saifuding's Speech**

—All ethnic groups should unite more closely to strive for the victorious completion of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy!

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China formulated under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, who is also the chairman of the State Planning Commission, on this plan, and I propose that the congress adopt this five-year plan draft and report. At the same time, I fully agree with the report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, who is also the Minister of Finance, on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, fully agree with the report of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, who is also the Minister of National Defense, on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and propose that the congress adopt this budget report, draft of the Military Service Law, and report.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of our country, which has been completed and proposed under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, is of great historical significance because it is the implementation of the general task of our transitional period, gradually transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, and it is the correct program and important step. Such a plan is something that has never been and could never be in the past life of our people. According to our first five-year plan, in the process of developing the national economy, greater achievements will be made than in the recovery period. In five years, the total expenditure for national economy and cultural education will be 76.64 billion yuan. The total industrial output value in 1952 was 27.01 billion yuan, and by 1957, it will reach 535.6 billion yuan (an increase of 98.3%); the total agricultural output value (including sideline output value) in 1952 was 48.39 billion yuan, and by 1957, it will reach 596.6 billion yuan (an increase of 23.3%). Based on the development of production, the material and cultural living standards of the people of the whole country, including the people of all ethnic minorities, will be improved to a certain extent, and a good foundation will be laid for them to establish a more prosperous and happy life.

The people of all ethnic minorities in the country, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, all live as powerful members of the People's Republic of China. The equal rights of all ethnic minorities in all aspects have been fixed in legal form in the Constitution adopted at the first session of the First National People's Congress last year. Now, the first session of the Second National People's Congress is discussing and will adopt the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, and every chapter and every item of economic and cultural education construction in it are the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Not only that, but in the first five-year plan, special emphasis is placed on the work of transportation, trade, finance, culture and education, health, and cadre training in ethnic minority areas, which fully proves that the first five-year plan attaches great importance to the interests of ethnic minorities. For these, the people of all ethnic groups feel great excitement and inspiration. At the same time, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the great Han people, we, the people of all ethnic minorities, will definitely be able to gradually transition to a socialist society and gain unlimited development prospects.

Since liberation, the people of all ethnic minorities in the country, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the care of the Central People's Government, have all achieved many new achievements to varying degrees and laid some foundations for the gradual development of the national economy. Take Xinjiang, a multi-ethnic region on the northwestern border of our motherland, as an example. In the past few years, Xinjiang has carried out campaigns to suppress counter-revolutionaries, reform the land system, "three anti" and "five anti," and has trained a large number of ethnic minority cadres. From 1950 to the end of 1952, agricultural and animal husbandry production was restored and developed, and several modern industries were also established (before liberation, it can be said that Xinjiang had no modern industry). The specific facts are as follows: the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1952 reached 684.2414 million yuan (calculated in new currency, the same below), of which the total industrial output value was 39.0754 million yuan (accounting for 5.71%); the total agricultural output value was 4.034695 million yuan (accounting for 58.97%); the total animal husbandry output value was 1.060976 million yuan (accounting for 15.51%); the total handicraft output value was 1.355989 million yuan (accounting for 19.81%). Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed. In 1952, there was one institution of higher learning with 1,075 students; one specialized secondary school with 557 students; 40 secondary schools with 14,317 students; 1,800 primary schools with 331,870 students. These achievements have created favorable conditions for the implementation of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in the Xinjiang region.

Based on the draft of the first five-year plan of the state and the situation of the recovery and development of the national economy in the Xinjiang region, our task of implementing the first five-year plan is to focus on the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, while reorganizing and improving existing industrial and mining enterprises, carrying out new industries that can balance local supply, production, and sales, developing transportation and postal services, gradually developing state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, expanding the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, developing trade with the Soviet Union, gradually implementing socialist transformation of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and ensuring that the proportion of socialist economy in the entire national economy increases year by year, so as to appropriately meet the growing material and cultural living needs of the people of all ethnic groups.

The indicators that the Xinjiang region's first five-year plan aims to achieve are: the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1957 will be 12.932272 million yuan (an increase of 89% compared to 1952), of which the total industrial output value will be 292.7585 million yuan (an increase of 649% compared to 1952); the total agricultural output value will be 5.871952 million yuan (an increase of 45.5% compared to 1952); the total animal husbandry output value will be 2.077 million yuan (an increase of 95.7% compared to 1952); the total handicraft output value will be 2.05735 million yuan (an increase of 51.6% compared to 1952). The agricultural development plan is as follows: the total grain output in 1957 will reach 43.49401 million jin, an increase of 35.77% compared to 1952; the total cotton output will reach 1.0592 million jin, an increase of 336% compared to 1952; the total output of oil crops will reach 171 million jin, an increase of 15.05%. By 1957, the number of organized households will reach 760,000, accounting for 85% of the total number of households; the number of agricultural production cooperatives will develop to 8,000, and the number of farms will reach 320, and 10 tractor stations will be established. In 1957, the number of various livestock will reach 23.124 million, an increase of 67.37% compared to 1952.

The development plan for cultural education and health care in five years is as follows: by 1957, the number of students in institutions of higher learning will reach 2,050; there will be three specialized secondary schools with 3,441 students; there will be eight normal schools with 3,200 students; there will be 66 secondary schools with 41,555 students; there will be 2,198 primary schools with 428,180 students. In addition, there is one Xinjiang Agricultural College. The basic construction of Xinjiang Medical College will be completed in 1957, and work will begin. There will be 98 hospitals with 2,615 beds; 4 sanatoriums with 190 beds; 9 maternal and child health care centers with 50 beds. There will be 99 film projection teams and 26 cinemas. There will be 64 cultural centers, 2 libraries, and 1 museum. There will be 10 kinds of newspapers published, totaling 22.221 million copies; 5 kinds of magazines, totaling 455,000 copies; 350 kinds of books, totaling 2.85 million copies.

The above are the achievements already made and the indicators to be achieved in the period of national economic development in the first five-year plan in one of the ethnic minority regions of our country—Xinjiang. It is obvious that these achievements already made and the indicators to be achieved have greatly changed and will further greatly change the face of Xinjiang, and have greatly changed and will further greatly improve the economic and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. It is for this reason that I, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, express my heartfelt thanks to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government.

However, this does not mean that there are no shortcomings and errors in the work of Xinjiang. Our work has shortcomings and certain errors at the same time as we have achieved great historical achievements, especially in basic construction, production, finance, trade, and commerce departments, there are more serious and prominent shortcomings and errors. However, some of these shortcomings and errors in work have been corrected in time, and some are being corrected.

To develop the cause of national construction, to develop the economic and cultural undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are eager for the railway to reach Xinjiang as soon as possible, and they are eager for this international railway line, which is closer than any other, to connect our capital Beijing with the great Moscow. Here, I repeat to the Second Session of the National People's Congress the wish of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. We also know that the problem is not just to hope that the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will be completed soon, but the important thing is to do a good job of all the preparatory work for the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. These preparatory works are to create the conditions needed for large-scale economic construction in Xinjiang after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. We must make great efforts to survey wasteland, develop water conservancy, expand the area of cultivated land; strengthen agricultural production to increase grain and various economic crops, especially cotton; develop animal husbandry, increase livestock products; speed up geological surveys to identify underground resources; train a large number of cadres, etc. Doing a good job of these works is of great significance for the large-scale economic construction in Xinjiang after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, with the help of the Han people and the production troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, and with the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, we will definitely do a good job of the above-mentioned various works to be done to welcome the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

In the Xinjiang region, to ensure the successful completion of the above tasks, various measures must be taken, one of which is to continue to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The Xinjiang region, like other places in the country, has seen increasingly rampant sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries. They spread rumors, sow discord, disrupt ethnic unity, disrupt socialist construction and socialist transformation, and carry out sabotage of production, machinery, arson, and harm to responsible personnel and workers in various production departments of the state, and even organize counter-revolutionary uprisings. These evil activities have aroused great indignation among the people of all ethnic groups. At the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress held in June this year, it was unanimously proposed to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and when we inspected work in various places, many people also proposed the same. To ensure the successful completion of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, to protect the interests of the people of all ethnic groups, it is necessary, according to the provisions of the Constitution and the demands of the broad masses, to give the enemies of the people a severe blow, eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate all obstacles in our socialist revolutionary advance.

In addition, we fully support the great call and decision of this meeting to advocate thrift and oppose waste, and we will resolutely implement and carry out this in the Xinjiang region to accelerate the accumulation of funds and the development of socialist construction.

**Title: The First Five-Year Plan and the Development of National Economy**
**Author: 彭泽民**

**Page: 1**

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

Under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, our entire nation is striving forward with great effort to achieve victory. The people of all ethnic groups in our country are uniting more firmly and resolutely around the great family of the People's Republic of China. The facts prove that the unity of all ethnic groups in our country is the sincere wish of all ethnic groups. Before us, there are new and great tasks that need our efforts to accomplish. We must further strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants, and on this basis, further strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, striving to achieve victory in the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan.

Comrade Peng Zemin's Speech

Since 1953, our entire nation has, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, begun to implement the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Now, more than two years have passed. At this meeting, we have seen this first Five-Year Plan, which has been carefully studied and meticulously drafted over a long period. This economic construction plan, which is rich in content, well-planned, and far-reaching in scope, is also very practical for China. It is the decisive program for the Communist Party of China to lead the entire nation to struggle for the transitional period's overall task. This plan expresses the common wish of the Chinese people, reflecting the highest and long-term interests of the Chinese people as a whole. We see the greatness of our motherland from this plan and are greatly encouraged by the proposal of this great plan. I wholeheartedly support this plan and support Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council, in his report on the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. I propose that the conference unanimously adopt this plan. At the same time, I agree with Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget report; I support Comrade Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier, on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, on the comprehensive plan for the prevention of Yellow River disasters and the development of Yellow River water resources, and Comrade Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman, on the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I recommend that the conference unanimously adopt it.

I would like to say a few words about the first Five-Year Plan and its relation to agricultural production. Since liberation, our country's agricultural production has gradually improved through land reform, but there are still many difficulties, mainly that the backward small-scale peasant economy has not changed, and it is often threatened by natural disasters. Recently, I returned to my hometown in Guangdong for an inspection and happened to encounter a severe drought throughout the province. From this disaster and the anti-drought situation, I deeply felt the correctness and importance of the agricultural transformation and development plan in the first Five-Year Plan. To illustrate some problems, I will briefly report the anti-drought situation in Guangdong that I saw this time.

Guangdong has not had a significant rain for more than eight months, a drought unprecedented in decades. Many ponds have dried up, rivers have stopped flowing, and the soil has cracked more than a foot deep, seriously affecting Guangdong's agricultural production. To complete this year's agricultural production plan, the farmers of the entire province, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, have long and arduously carried out the anti-drought struggle. They dredged rivers, dug wells, and opened ditches, overcoming all difficulties and hardships, working day and night selflessly. During the drought, farmers used transplanting and dry planting methods to save seedlings. When dry planting, farmers often scraped their fingers, but they did not care. Wells were dug everywhere; in the Xijiang area alone, farmers dug 104,100 wells. The largest project was the construction of dams to block rivers and divert water for irrigation. In my hometown in the Zhongjiang area, there were two major projects: blocking the main stream of the Beijiang River and blocking the Suijiang River. When blocking the main stream of the Beijiang River, a dam more than 500 meters long and a secondary dam more than 200 meters long were built, blocking what was once considered an unruly river and making it flow according to the people's will to the nearby drought-stricken farmland. Such large-scale projects were carried out everywhere. In the final stage of the anti-drought struggle, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee mobilized tens of thousands of workers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, cadres, and students to go to the countryside to support the farmers in their anti-drought efforts. Provincial and municipal organs and the province of Hubei sent water pumps to support them, further encouraging the farmers' anti-drought spirit.

Due to the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, the persistent anti-drought efforts finally resulted in continuous heavy rain on the second day after the summer solstice. At this time, the workers, soldiers, cadres, and students who went to the countryside to support the farmers all worked together to help the farmers rush to transplant. The masses mutually adjusted labor and livestock power. They brought food to the fields to eat, not even taking a break for a meal. These fully demonstrated the farmers' high labor enthusiasm. After a tense battle, they finally achieved a great victory in the anti-drought work. Comrades, I have a piece of good news to report: the drought-stricken areas in Guangdong have now started harvesting, and the results are quite good.

During this anti-drought struggle, farmers deeply felt the pain of not improving water conservancy in the past, and once it didn't rain, a drought disaster would occur. After liberation, the people's government gradually improved agricultural water conservancy. However, during the anti-drought work, farmers still felt that there were not enough water pumps, and the effect of using old-style water wheels to draw water was not significant. Some farmers said: "Water pumps are much better than our wells, and the water volume is much larger, but unfortunately, there are too few." The experience of the total line going down to the countryside and anti-drought work deeply educated the farmers, making them feel that it is impossible to resist natural disasters by operating individually on small plots of land. The leading role and superiority of agricultural production cooperatives in anti-drought work made farmers more eager to move towards collectivization and further demand the use of machinery for farming. This time, when I returned, an 80-year-old old lady told me about her family's production and living conditions, and she was very happy. She repeatedly thanked Chairman Mao. She said: "After land reform, I got land and cattle (two families share one cow), and my lazy and gluttonous son became a hardworking and thrifty good farmer under the education of the Communist Party and the people's government." I asked her what she hoped for now? She replied: "If there were tractors to farm the land, that would be even better." This old lady truly expressed the wishes of the broad masses of farmers. Our five-year plan is to gradually meet these demands of the farmers.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have already achieved great revolutionary victories. After the first Five-Year Plan is passed, the six hundred million Chinese people will definitely continue to strive under the leadership of the Communist Party, diligently and thriftily, to complete and strive to overfulfill this plan.

However, domestic and foreign enemies will not be content with their failures. In the process of our great economic construction, the imperialists of the United States and the bandits of the Kuomintang will definitely try to sabotage us from all sides. We must be one hundred times more vigilant and prevent and eliminate all sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the victory of socialism.

Finally, I would like to express my personal hope to overseas Chinese. For many years, overseas Chinese have hoped for the prosperity and strength of their motherland. Now, the first Five-Year Plan and the various policies we have formulated are precisely in line with the common aspirations of the broad masses of overseas Chinese. I hope that patriotic overseas Chinese will unite more closely, actively participate in the construction of the motherland, and contribute all their strength to build a great socialist motherland.

**Title: The First Five-Year Plan and International Significance**
**Author: 罗隆基**

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

I fully agree with and support the State Council's proposal to the conference on the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan; the 1954 budget and the 1955 budget; the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China; the comprehensive plan for the prevention of Yellow River disasters and the development of Yellow River water resources. I agree with the reports by Comrades Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui on the above-mentioned laws. I agree with Comrade Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Today, I would like to point out that the first Five-Year Plan we are discussing at this conference is not just a matter of one country, China, but has important international significance. Our first Five-Year Plan is a matter of China's peaceful construction, a matter of China's building a new country in a world of peace. At the same time, this is a matter of the six hundred million Chinese people striving to defend their motherland and defend Asian and world peace.

At the Helsinki Peace Conference, I clearly saw that the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the national economic recovery and the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan over the past two years have had a significant impact internationally and received a good response.

The Chinese delegation at this World Peace Conference was concerned with the overall problem of world peace. At the same time, the World Peace Conference recognized the importance of issues related to China in the cause of world peace. Therefore, in the final resolution, it clearly stated: "According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the restoration of the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations is the only way for the United Nations to achieve its purposes." The comprehensive resolution of the World Peace Conference solemnly declared to the world: "Taiwan is indisputably an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. Foreign troops should withdraw from Taiwan, and Taiwan should be returned to China."

This shows what? This shows that the representatives of the World Peace Conference know that the peaceful construction of New China is beneficial to world peace, that the peaceful construction of the Chinese people serves world peace, and that the peaceful construction of the Chinese people is a common cause of the world's peace-loving peoples. The peace-loving peoples of the world have clearly seen the following facts:

The economic construction of China is of a socialist nature. The purpose of the socialist construction cause is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. This is fundamentally different from the industry of capitalist countries, where private capitalists, in order to obtain excessive profits, plunder the resources of backward countries, invade the territories of backward countries, and use war to expand colonies.

The peaceful construction of China is a construction that must be carried out in a peaceful environment. This fully proves the sincerity of the Chinese people in "wanting peace and not war." We control the Yellow River and Huai River to eliminate water and drought disasters, of course, not to use the Yellow River and Huai River to train the navy. We reclaim wasteland and mountains to expand agricultural crops and cultivate forests, absolutely not to use hundreds of thousands of square miles of wasteland and mountains to test atomic and hydrogen bombs. China has no monopoly of military weapons, so there is no one who wants to create international tensions and start a world war to sell machine guns, tanks, airplanes, and cannons from factories.

The success of China's peaceful construction will encourage all backward countries to strive to develop their new industries and build prosperous and happy new countries. If all backward countries can achieve economic independence and self-reliance, the countries of the world can truly cooperate and coexist peacefully on an equal basis. The new China's economic exchanges and technical assistance with neighboring and friendly countries are fundamentally different from the United States imperialism using the "aid" banner to destroy the sovereignty of other countries, invade the territories of other countries, universally establish military bases, and actively prepare for world war.

The success of China's economic construction will inevitably strengthen China's national defense forces and will inevitably strengthen the forces of the world peace, democratic, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The people of the world know that today's international situation is gradually easing, and the Geneva Conference of the four major powers was able to be held and achieved an initial satisfactory result, mainly due to the influence of the success of the economic construction and the consistent peace policy of the Soviet Union, China, and the democratic countries of the world.

Comrades, we must understand that in today's international situation, the construction that peace-loving peoples welcome and cherish is precisely the construction that the enemies of peace oppose, fear, and envy. For such peaceful construction, they will definitely spread rumors and sabotage.

The newspapers of capitalist countries are not using sarcastic and mocking tones to estimate the future of our industrial construction? They use malicious wishes as if they were real, they determine that China's industrial development will never catch up with Britain and the United States, and therefore, they comfort themselves by saying: "By the year 2000, the industrial progress of Britain and Germany will not remain at the current level, let alone the United States!" They want to use such malicious propaganda to erase the essential differences between socialism and capitalism and cover up the huge differences in the speed of production development between the two systems. But facts cannot be erased, and facts cannot be covered up. Let's see what the actual facts are!

From 1929 to 1951, in this period of more than twenty years, British industry increased by only 60%, and although the United States used industrial militarization to increase production, American industrial production in this period increased by only one fold. In contrast, Soviet industry increased by twelvefold. The annual average development speed of socialist Soviet industry was more than ten times that of the United States. The industrial production of the six people's democratic countries in Europe (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania) increased by 20% in 1952, while the industrial production of the six capitalist countries in Western Europe (France, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Greece, and Luxembourg) increased by only 0.8%. In other words, the speed of industrial increase in people's democratic countries is 25 times that of the six capitalist countries in Western Europe. Just take our first Five-Year Plan as an example. In five years, the labor productivity of state-owned industries will increase by 64%, an average of about 10% per year. It must be pointed out that the production speed of decaying and dying capitalism is today from stagnation to gradual decline. Facts speak louder than words. These ironclad facts fully prove Lenin's prophecy: "Capitalism can be thoroughly defeated because socialism can create a new and much higher labor productivity!"

By the year 2000, what will be the level of industrial development in the United States and Britain? The development of historical laws will give the answer. I believe that the people of the United States and Britain will eventually understand this, and it is better to understand it sooner. Today, who would want, and who would dare, to insure the life of a decaying and dying capitalist system for fifty years!

The principles of socialist countries are clear: different systems of countries coexist peacefully and compete peacefully. We have already surpassed the advanced countries of capitalism in political system superiority, and we have far outstripped the United States and Britain. In terms of economics, in peaceful competition, the Chinese people have full confidence and absolute guarantee to catch up with and surpass the so-called advanced countries of capitalism.

At the recent Geneva Conference of the four major powers, Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, put forward many specific proposals to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, the Prime Minister of Britain, Eden, and the Prime Minister of France, Foul, to peacefully solve European and world problems. This is a real test of the heads of the United States, Britain, and France. We support these proposals of the Soviet Union. The joint statements on the principles of peaceful coexistence issued by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of China, and the Prime Ministers of India, Nehru, Burma, U Nu, and Indonesia, Sukarno, show that the Chinese people and government welcome the use of peaceful consultations to solve all international problems, including Far Eastern problems, to achieve the goal of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition!

Comrades, although the Geneva Conference of the four major powers ended in a good atmosphere, issues such as European security, the German problem, the disarmament problem, and the development of East-West contacts still need to be resolved. Due to the manipulation and instigation of American imperialism, the international situation in the Far East is still becoming increasingly tense. In such an international situation, the representatives of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress have the necessity and responsibility to declare to the world once again: to defend the security of the motherland's peaceful construction, to defend Asian and world peace, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people unanimously support the wise policy of Premier Zhou Enlai in handling the Taiwan issue: "The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan has two possible ways, namely, the way of war and the way of peace. The Chinese people are willing to strive for the liberation of Taiwan in peaceful ways under possible conditions." The Chinese people have many precedents of peaceful liberation in the war of liberation. However, the liberation of Taiwan is completely an internal affair of China. The Chinese people have the right to choose their own methods and ways to solve internal affairs. The Chinese people have the right to use all their forces in the exercise of sovereignty to complete the task of national reunification and to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland. The Chinese people have the confidence and strength to achieve the victory of liberating Taiwan! If the United States imperialism does not withdraw its armed forces occupying Taiwan and continues to interfere in China's internal affairs with armed forces, all consequences will be borne by the United States government itself.

Comrades, one of the important tasks of the first Five-Year Plan is to timely prepare the necessary technical and economic conditions to the maximum extent to improve national defense forces, to strike the enemy's plots of armed intervention and armed invasion of China. Lenin once said when encouraging the Soviet people to engage in heavy industry construction: "War is ruthless, and it poses questions in an uncompromising manner: either annihilation or catching up with and surpassing the advanced countries in the economic field." Today, this is still a good lesson for the Chinese people!

Comrades, let us unanimously pass the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan at this conference!

Let us call on all six hundred million Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, to work wholeheartedly, increase production, practice thrift, overcome all difficulties, and complete the first Five-Year Plan!

Let us firmly remember Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions and encouragement to the entire nation:

"We are doing something that our ancestors have never done before, something extremely glorious and great.

Our goal must be achieved.

Our goal will definitely be achieved."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

I fully agree with and support the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China" and Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council, on the "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy." I also agree with the other reports at the conference. The blueprint for building our country is now before our eyes, which has increased our strength a hundredfold for our future work. We feel so excited.

The preamble of the first Five-Year Plan draft states: "Under the leadership of the working class and its party, the Communist Party of China, the alliance between workers and peasants is the foundation for our country's great victory in the people's revolution and the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship. It is also the foundation for our country's continued victory in socialism. To use and strengthen the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship to develop and transform the national economy in a planned way, to build a socialist society, we must continuously strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants, and strengthen the national united front of all ethnic groups based on the alliance between workers and peasants." From the work practice of the past few years in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, it is proven that this instruction is completely correct. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in the region have closely united around the Communist Party and the people's government, and through the suppression of bandits, construction, and the cultivation of ethnic cadres, the development of production, the region has shown a prosperous and thriving situation. Now we should further strengthen ethnic unity and carry out various work. In the discussion of the draft of the Five-Year Plan this time, I have a deeper understanding: the economic and cultural undertakings of ethnic minority areas, the improvement of people's lives, must also be carried out in the spirit of the Five-Year Plan, according to the different conditions of different regions, considering both possibilities and needs, to advance step by step and in an orderly manner. To strongly support the socialist economic construction of the country, further strengthen ethnic unity, and improve the lives of people of all ethnic groups, according to the regulations of the Five-Year Plan and the actual situation of the rice-growing area, the region should first vigorously develop agricultural and pastoral production. Assist farmers in improving agricultural tools, improving farming methods, expanding cultivated land, and gradually achieving self-sufficiency in grain. Under the necessary and possible conditions of the country, send agricultural technicians to survey the grasslands in the region, and plan to build farms. The region has vast grasslands, flat terrain, and sparse population, with a large amount of potential for the development of agricultural and pastoral production. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the agricultural and pastoral production tasks. However, the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits and special agents do not want us to walk this happy path. They will use all means to sabotage our construction. Although the bandits have been basically eliminated after liberation in the region, especially after the People's Congress of the Autonomous Region passed the "Agreement on Unity and Suppression of Bandits" in 1954, social order has significantly improved, but so far, in areas where our work is weak, such as the border areas of a few provinces, there are still a few escaped bandits and special agents engaged in rumor-mongering and sabotage activities, looting state and people's property, assassinating government officials, and inciting ethnic unity and internal ethnic unity. In addition, some outsiders and local hidden counter-revolutionaries collude with each other, also sabotage production, sabotage social order, and threaten the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups. This year alone, there have been dozens of incidents of forest fires. To carry out various work smoothly and ensure the safety of the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups, according to the Constitution and the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, it is an urgent task to thoroughly eliminate bandits and special agents and severely punish counter-revolutionaries. We must further strengthen ethnic unity, strengthen public security work, mobilize people of all ethnic groups to formulate agreements, educate people of all ethnic groups not to be complacent about the enemy, especially ethnic leaders who have contact with the people should bear the responsibility of maintaining public security. The enemy cannot be treated leniently on one side. If the enemy is treated leniently on one side, the people will suffer. In the Five-Year construction plan, we must be more vigilant against the enemy's sabotage plots. In addition, we suggest that in the border areas of a few provinces, the relevant provinces should have unified leadership and unified steps in the issue of clearing bandits and special agents, not leaving any gaps for the activities of bandits and special agents.

Comrades, only with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, led by the working class, based on the alliance between workers and peasants, only when the economic lifeline of the country is in the hands of the people themselves, can our country have the possibility of planned development of the national economy and the implementation of socialist construction and transformation. However, our country was once a semi-colonial, colonial, and semi-feudal country under long-term imperialist rule, with extremely backward economics. Therefore, in the process of large-scale economic construction, there are many difficulties. But we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the selfless help of the great Soviet people, and the iron-like unity and hard struggle of all ethnic groups in the country. We will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and complete and overfulfill the great tasks of the first Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

I fully agree with the reports by Comrades Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, Vice Premiers, and Comrade Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman. I enthusiastically support the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and will resolutely strive to achieve the Five-Year Plan.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our national economy has followed the economic policies of the Common Program under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and has carried out planned recovery and construction. By the end of 1952, the recovery stage of the national economy was completed, and favorable conditions were prepared for the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan. Now we have entered the third year of the Five-Year Plan, which fully proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the selfless and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, and with the united efforts of workers, peasants, and all ethnic groups and democratic parties, the recovery and construction of our national economy have not wasted time and have not taken detours, and the achievements are brilliant and worthy of our joy and excitement.

The first session of the First National People's Congress solemnly adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954. The second session of the First National People's Congress of the State Council timely proposed the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China and the national budget and expenditure, the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and the comprehensive plan for the prevention of Yellow River disasters and the development of Yellow River water resources. This fully demonstrates the high spirit of our people's government in practicing the Constitution and the most basic steps in implementing the Constitution.

Our Constitution is a socialist-type constitution. The preamble of the Constitution states: "The people's democratic system of the People's Republic of China is also the new democratic system, which guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." It also says, "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the establishment of a socialist society, this is a transitional period. The overall task of the state in the transitional period is to gradually achieve the socialist industrialization of the country and to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." I listened to the reports by Comrades Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, Vice Premiers, and I read the relevant documents. I feel that they are completely in line with the spirit and provisions of the Constitution. The Five-Year Plan and the Military Service Law, as well as the Yellow River treatment plan, concretize and implement the major economic and national defense significance and provisions of the entire Constitution in a planned manner. This is in line with the interests and wishes of the entire nation and will undoubtedly gain the support and approval of all representatives and the entire nation. It is undeniable that thrift and the opposition to waste are important links to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan. In the relevant documents, this has been emphasized. The two Comrades Li, Vice Premiers, have made serious and profound criticisms of the waste phenomena that have occurred in the past, which is very necessary. In Comrade Li Xiannian's report, it is mentioned that the phenomenon of embezzlement and theft has recently increased somewhat. According to incomplete statistics, the number of embezzlers is as high as 4,300, and the amount of embezzled cash is more than 600,000 yuan. I think that the crime of embezzlement is heavier than waste in legal terms, but the loss caused by waste is much greater than embezzlement. The sum of the embezzlement of thousands of people is not comparable to the waste of a part of a certain department, which is a shocking contrast. Comrade Li Fuchun said, "In short, in the future, the state must establish a series of thrift systems and thrift methods in all aspects, specifying what is allowed to be done and what is not allowed to be done. Whatever is not allowed to be done, if it is done, it is a crime." I particularly pay attention to this sentence. I feel that in the past, there has been enough attention to the opposition to waste, but there are still some people who only pay attention to embezzlement and neglect waste, which is wrong. In the past, the work of economic legislation has also been felt to be insufficient. We can no longer tolerate the waste that causes huge losses to the state. Therefore, I suggest that the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee strengthen this aspect of legislation and supervision of its implementation in the future. The Five-Year Plan is a law formulated by the second session of the First National People's Congress, which is to be jointly implemented and observed by the entire nation. Violating it or failing to complete the plan tasks will be legally responsible. The report and plan list the necessary measures and matters needing attention for the implementation of each production plan, among which some need to be regulated by laws and orders to be implemented, and at the same time, they are also the basis for some legislation.

The Five-Year Plan is based on socialist industrialization, but it must develop agriculture to support and assist it. The Five-Year Plan has given sufficient attention and appropriate investment to agriculture. Organizing agricultural production cooperatives is the most basic and effective work to develop agricultural production at present. Before the meeting, I visited several agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tongxian County. The impression I got is: 1. The production of each cooperative has increased to different degrees and is increasing year by year. 2. The living standards of the members are also improving to different degrees and can be guaranteed to continue to improve year by year, and the children of the members can all go to school. 3. The accounts can be published monthly, and the loans can be repaid on time. 4. Each cooperative has its own characteristics and can adapt to the environment and establish different methods and systems. From these examples, I am more convinced that agricultural cooperation is the basic step towards socialism and is the most effective and economical method to increase production at present. Only after completing agricultural cooperation, can agricultural production and the living standards of farmers continue to develop and improve with the development of industrialization, and only then can the great task of leading the rural economy be completed. However, due to the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives in the past, some places have not fully implemented the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and some places have not done enough work in leading and helping individual farmers. It is necessary to develop and consolidate at the same time. After consolidation, agricultural production cooperatives will definitely be able to develop rapidly and comprehensively and will definitely be able to complete the great task of agricultural increase and leadership of the rural economy.

The implementation of the Five-Year Plan is a special class struggle under the current circumstances. Domestic and foreign enemies will not miss any opportunity to sabotage us, especially in the socialist transformation of some classes and some people, they will incite and create divisions, making them unwittingly step onto the road of counter-revolution. Therefore, to complete the Five-Year Plan, we must maintain long-term vigilance. For example, people like me, who have many old relationships in society, have some old ideas left, and for some necessary phenomena in socialist transformation, they often have blurred perceptions due to the reflection of old relationships and old ideas, which is very understandable. Therefore, we should be even more vigilant. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the consolidation of national defense are necessary to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan and are the constant tasks in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

The first Five-Year Plan is a new era of planned economy in China and is a great textbook of the national economy for the Chinese people. As the Constitution stipulates in Article 15: "The state uses economic plans to guide the development and transformation of the national economy, so that productivity is continuously improved, to improve the material and cultural life of the people, and to consolidate the independence and security of the state." This Five-Year Plan is a milestone for guiding the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives. It clearly points out the progress of the national economy in a certain period and the beautiful national prospects. Its educational significance is very great. Every Chinese person has the responsibility to implement the Five-Year Plan, and every person should strive to learn this course, see the beautiful national prospects clearly, and overcome any difficulties in the present. This Five-Year Plan has given the Chinese people unlimited hope and unlimited encouragement.

The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao are the core forces leading our cause. The Chinese people must unite around the Communist Party of China to consolidate national defense and strive to achieve the Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

I fully agree with the reports by Comrades Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, Vice Premiers, and Comrade Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman. After discussing the first Five-Year Plan, the budget and expenditure, the Military Service Law, the Yellow River plan, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, we all feel that our people are truly the masters of the house, leading our country to a prosperous and strong path and to the bright road of socialism.

I am satisfied with the speed of industrial development stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The average annual growth rate of industrial production stipulated in our first Five-Year Plan is 14.7%. What does this mean? This means that if we can maintain this average growth rate, then our country's industrial production will approximately double every five years, increasing geometrically. This means that if we can roughly maintain this average annual growth rate, then after ten Five-Year Plans, our industrial production can increase hundreds of times compared to 1952.

Such a development speed is the speed of socialism, and it is only possible under the leadership of the working class and the people's democratic dictatorship based on the alliance between workers and peasants. Under the capitalist system and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, no country can and has never realized such a high-speed industrial development. As for the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, it is even more impossible to have such industrial development.

To compare, I will now list the average annual growth rate of industrial production of the two fastest industrial development countries in the capitalist world and the average annual growth rate of industrial production of the socialist Soviet Union:

In Europe, Germany's industrial development was the fastest. The average annual growth rate of German industrial production before the First World War was as follows:

* 1860-1870: 2.7%
* 1870-1880: 4.1%
* 1880-1890: 6.4%
* 1890-1900: 6.1%
* 1900-1913: 4.2%

The United States is the country with the fastest industrial development speed in the world. The average annual growth rate of American industrial production is as follows:

* 1849-1859: 6.1%
* 1859-1869: 8.2%
* 1869-1879: 3.1%
* 1879-1889: 5.5%
* 1889-1899: 3.3%
* 1899-1909: 5.1%
* 1909-1919: 11.5% (During this decade, the First World War occurred, and the United States did not suffer destruction but made war profits.)
* 1919-1929: 3.8%
* 1929-1939: 0%
* 1939-1943: 22% (These four years were during the Second World War, and the United States made another war profit.)
* 1943-1953: 0.4%

The development speed of industrial production in socialist countries is far ahead of the usual development speed of industrial production in capitalist countries. The average annual growth rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union is as follows:

* First Five-Year Plan: 19%
* Second Five-Year Plan: 19.1%
* Third Five-Year Plan: 13.5%
* The fourth Five-Year Plan is a plan for the recovery of industry after the Second World War.
* Fifth Five-Year Plan: 13% (planned figures)

The speed of industrial development in our country will be similar to that of the Soviet Union and will far exceed the usual development speed of all capitalist countries.

Before us, there are two paths. One is the path of socialism, which is to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance between workers and peasants, to carry out socialist construction and transformation, so that our industrial production level can catch up with and surpass the most powerful capitalist countries in a few decades. The other path is to take the path of capitalism, which is not to have the people's government led by the working class, but to have a bourgeois dictatorship and do things according to the wishes of the bourgeoisie. This path will result in the restoration of imperialism and feudal forces. The experience of the Chinese revolution over the past hundred years has already clearly told us that in the era when capitalism has developed into imperialism, to want to take the path of capitalism is just a reactionary fantasy, just to open the way for the counter-revolutionary restoration of imperialism and feudalism.

To compare the issue more deeply, I would like to ask everyone to recall 1927. At that time, the democratic revolution of the Chinese people was about to succeed, the Beiyang warlords had collapsed, but a betrayal occurred within the revolutionary camp. In April and July, the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei successively betrayed the revolution. They cursed the Communist Party for being "extreme," saying that "communism is not suitable for China's national conditions," and they said a lot of good things to the national bourgeoisie, assuring them that they were not the running dogs of imperialism and promising to build a capitalist China. At that time, except for the Communist Party of China and Comrade Song Qingling, Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, He Xiangning, and other progressive people who saw through the true colors of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, the bourgeoisie in the country, including the national bourgeoisie, believed in the words of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei and placed their hopes in them. It was not until after the "September 18th Incident" in 1931 that the national bourgeoisie began to realize that they had been deceived and began to know that Chiang Kai-shek "said a lot of good things but did a lot of bad things," and began to know that Chiang Kai-shek was originally the running dog of imperialism, not only did not want the laboring people but also did not want the national bourgeoisie. The counter-revolution in 1927 and Chen Duxiu's right opportunism added heavy suffering to the already deep suffering of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people continued to struggle for more than twenty years, went through three periods of war, namely, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and shed the blood of countless revolutionary fighters, including Comrades Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, to achieve the victory of the people's democratic revolution.

If the capitalist China promised by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei in 1927 was just a ghost story, a cover or disguise for surrendering to imperialism and feudal forces, then behind this ghost story, cover, or disguise, there were the plots of counter-revolutionary restoration. In this regard, the various sayings and ideas of taking the path of capitalism today will not be any more clever, but are just the changed face or idea of the so-called "free China" of American imperialism, which is the counter-revolutionary restoration, or just a groundless fantasy. Of course, the situation today is quite different from that of 1927. The power of the people has become incomparably great, and the unity of the people has become very solid. The people have already taken the reins of power themselves. However, reviewing the experience of 1927 is beneficial. We can thereby more deeply understand that the two paths before us are: either to take the path of socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, so that our country can catch up with and surpass the industrial production level of the most powerful capitalist countries in a few decades; or to take the path of capitalism, which will help the restoration of imperialism and feudal forces. The two must be one. There is no middle path. I believe that the people of the whole country firmly support taking the first path, the path of socialism, and oppose taking the second path, the path of counter-revolutionary restoration.

When we put forward the issue of the two paths, is it alarmist, is it "extreme"? Not at all. We passed the Constitution at our first session, which stipulates taking the path of socialism. However, after passing the Constitution, we found the treason case of Pan Hannian and the counter-revolutionary group of Hu Feng. Pan Hannian and Hu Feng were both representatives of the National People's Congress and both personally voted to support the Constitution. They agreed with us on the surface, but in fact, they opposed the people's government led by the working class and opposed socialism. They wanted to take another path, the path of counter-revolutionary restoration. Pan Hannian and Hu Feng have been decided by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to be arrested and tried according to law, which is a completely correct measure.

Pan Hannian is a long-term spy buried in the revolutionary camp. Hu Feng's actions are "heart-digging warfare" in theory. To put it metaphorically, everyone has seen a five-color film from the German Democratic Republic called "Cold Heart," and Hu Feng is the "Dutch ghost" in that film.

Why are there such counter-revolutionaries as Pan Hannian and Hu Feng among our representatives? Why do they use two-faced tactics to sabotage the revolution instead of using open struggle to oppose the revolution? Is this accidental?

This is definitely not accidental. This shows:

First, with the progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, class struggle is not easing but is sharpening. The reactionary elements in the exploiting classes oppose the people's government led by the working class and oppose socialism. These enemies of the people are not soft and flabby. For the interests of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits and for the interests of the exploiting classes, they will use all means to fight resolutely. It is not difficult to imagine that in the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan, this struggle will intensify.

Second, the Communist Party of China and the people's government have unlimited prestige among the masses of the people. Open opposition to the Communist Party of China and the people's government will be immediately exposed by the people. After the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Geneva Conference, and the Asian-African Conference, the imperialists know that using military attacks to overthrow the people's government and achieve counter-revolutionary restoration is no longer a sure thing. Therefore, they place their hopes on sabotaging us from within, which is to adopt the tactic of Sun Wukong entering the belly, and to fight us on various fronts such as politics and law, finance and economy, culture and education, academic thought, united front, party work, etc. To carry out this struggle, they must wear a good-looking coat and adopt two-faced tactics.

The People's Daily compiled a book called "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group." This book is of great educational significance to every revolutionary and I recommend it to every representative of the conference. All counter-revolutionaries pay great attention to this book because it contains many secret letters of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, in which they confide their inexpressible counter-revolutionary private words to each other, and these private words resonate with every counter-revolutionary. We hope that every revolutionary will pay more attention to this book, learn from it, understand how counter-revolutionaries think and act under the current conditions of our country, understand what two-faced tactics are, understand how the "revolutionary" "Marxist" Hu Feng and the members of his counter-revolutionary group busily served counter-revolution behind the scenes, and understand how counter-revolutionaries can infiltrate and fight us on their own front. If we can all thereby increase our vigilance, learn the skills to distinguish hidden counter-revolutionaries, and learn the skills to expose these counter-revolutionaries, then we will have gained valuable results from the Hu Feng incident, and this result will help us smoothly complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan.

There is a dangerous idea. This idea assumes that the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan will be smooth sailing and will not go through serious struggles. We should know that we hope very much for the smooth completion and overfulfillment of the Five-Year Plan, but the counter-revolutionaries hope very much for the failure of the Five-Year Plan. The struggle over the implementation of the grain procurement and supply policy in the past year and this year can be seen as having gone through a serious struggle. The struggle against the anti-party clique of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, the struggle against the counter-revolutionary clique of Pan Hannian, and the struggle against the counter-revolutionary clique of Hu Feng were all extremely sharp class struggles. Each of these struggles will affect the success or failure of the Five-Year Plan, the smooth completion or setbacks. Therefore, we should not regard the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan as just a process of technical work, but should also regard it as a process of class struggle at the same time.

Counter-revolutionaries must be thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminated. Any leniency towards counter-revolutionaries is cruelty to revolutionaries. Some people think that Hu Feng cannot be considered a counter-revolutionary because he has no weapons. According to this saying, then Dai Jitao, Tao Xisheng, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and Chen Guofu should not be considered counter-revolutionaries either, which is extremely absurd. We should always remember that among the workers in party, government, military, industry, and mining enterprises, the vast majority, that is, more than 90%, are good people, and some of them have some shortcomings and errors, but they all belong to the category of good people. But at the same time, we must not neglect that there are indeed a few counter-revolutionaries among these workers, and if their plots succeed, we will suffer a great loss, because they will definitely carry out sabotage work. If we all become complacent, the entire plot of the counter-revolutionaries succeeds, that is the counter-revolutionary restoration, that is our country regressing by several decades. All of us, the people of the whole country, have the responsibility to increase vigilance and eliminate all spy elements. To eliminate these counter-revolutionaries, we must oppose the rightist thought of indifference to counter-revolutionaries in our own ranks, which can only help the enemy and harm ourselves.

We must pay attention to ideological work. If the enemy understands that they should carry out "heart-digging warfare" in theory, can we ignore ideological work? To achieve the victory of the people's democratic revolution, our country has had two historical Marxist ideological movements, one in 1919, the May Fourth Movement, and one in 1942, the Yan'an Rectification Movement. The May Fourth Movement brought Marxist thought to China, and the face of the Chinese revolution was renewed. Let us think, if there had been no May Fourth Movement and no arrival of Marxist thought in China, could the face of the Chinese revolution be renewed? Of course not. The Yan'an Rectification Movement criticized the errors of subjectivism, sectarianism, and party jargon, summarized the experience of more than twenty years of struggle of the Communist Party of China, and re-established the policy of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. This ideological movement improved the theoretical level of the Communist Party of China and ensured the victory of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the victory of national liberation. Obviously, if there had been no Yan'an Rectification Movement, we might still have stumbled and made mistakes in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the process of national liberation.

From the above facts, we can see the power of Marxist theory and the extreme importance of mastering Marxist theory to the Chinese revolution. I want to say it again, I am not talking about general importance here, but extreme importance. From this, we can also easily understand why the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group proposed such a program when carrying out "heart-digging warfare," and the first item of this program is to oppose the advocacy of learning Marxism-Leninism. We must firmly remember that what counter-revolutionaries fear the most is the advocacy of learning Marxism-Leninism. And the Chinese people want to liberate themselves, want to build a socialist society, they must learn Marxism-Leninism, they must take Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology.

If the completion of the people's democratic revolution requires the conduct of a Marxist ideological movement, then to achieve socialism, should we not conduct a Marxist ideological movement? Of course not. On the contrary. The socialist revolution is a broader and deeper revolution than the democratic revolution. This revolution aims to permanently eliminate all exploiting classes, to turn tens of millions of farmers who have been accustomed to producing alone on a small piece of barren land for thousands of years and tens of thousands of handicraftsmen into collective laborers in a rich cooperative, and to unite six hundred million people in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to struggle hard and unitedly. To achieve socialism, we must conduct a broader and deeper Marxist ideological movement than before.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in March this year to conduct a campaign to propagate materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism. It requires that within eight years, that is, by the end of the second Five-Year Plan, the vast majority of (about five million) cadres and intellectuals will understand what materialism is, what idealism is, what kinds of materialism and idealism there are, and what dialectical materialism and historical materialism are. And through them, to propagate materialism to the people of the whole country.

Materialists should not be confused with political counter-revolutionaries. Many idealists are good people in politics and can cooperate with the Communist Party. However, counter-revolutionaries must be idealists. Hu Shi and Hu Feng are clear evidence of this. They are all subjective idealists.

Although many idealists can cooperate with the Communist Party and advance together to a socialist society, we must not take idealist thought as the guiding ideology for building a socialist society, because idealism is the thought of the bourgeoisie. When we carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, the role of bourgeois thought is to resist transformation, obstruct socialist construction, obstruct progress, corrupt the laboring people, and disintegrate the unity of the laboring people, to the point of corrupting and disintegrating the Communist Party of China. Socialist construction and socialist transformation must take the thought of the working class, that is, Marxism-Leninism, as the guiding ideology.

After such a large-scale theoretical work, the vast majority of cadres and intellectuals will improve their sense of smell and learn to fight against imperialist thought and feudal thought, bourgeois thought and rich peasant thought, subjectivism and individualism, and various corrupt and degenerate tendencies in actual work.

After such a large-scale theoretical work, it will form the ideological and political unity of the people of the whole country based on Marxism-Leninism to achieve the construction and transformation of socialism.

This Marxist ideological movement, for religious believers and all non-Communist Party members, should be carried out on the basis of the guarantee of freedom of religious belief stipulated in the Constitution and the principle of voluntariness stipulated in the Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that is, except for Communist Party members who must study and schools that teach according to the prescribed curriculum, others are based on the principle of voluntariness. We and the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng are fundamentally opposed in that we actively advocate learning Marxism, while the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng advocates that everyone should not learn Marxism and should maintain reactionary thought.

I believe that the vast majority of intellectuals and cadres in the country, the vast majority of the people in the country, will gradually enthusiastically participate in the study of Marxism-Leninism, strive to carry out ideological reform, increase vigilance, and eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries. We will use such practical actions to give a powerful response to the "heart-digging warfare" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

The Five-Year Plan is a great plan, a socialist plan. The formulation and implementation of the Five-Year Plan are not calm and peaceful matters, but class struggles, and complex struggles between the two paths of socialism and counter-revolutionary restoration. The work of socialist construction and socialist transformation must have corresponding ideological and political work to ensure its completion. Let us unite, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, struggle for socialism, and struggle for the smooth completion of the first Five-Year Plan!

**Title: The First Five-Year Plan and the Development of National Economy**
**Author: 傅作义**
**Date: 1955-07-08**

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

After listening to Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, on the report of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, I feel very excited. As Chairman Mao said, "We are doing something that our ancestors have never done before, something extremely glorious and great," the first Five-Year Plan is the first step to achieve this great cause. We will definitely strive to complete the water conservancy tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan draft to ensure the victory of the national construction plan.

In the first Five-Year Plan draft, the policy and tasks of water conservancy construction are stipulated as follows: "To ensure agricultural increase, we must vigorously carry out water control projects. Under the policy of combining fundamental and symptomatic treatment and comprehensive prevention of floods, droughts, and waterlogging, the main task during the first Five-Year Plan period is to continue to treat severely harmful rivers with a focus, strengthen the dikes of important rivers, and vigorously carry out flood control work, and actively build agricultural water conservancy." According to this stipulation, reducing water and drought disasters and increasing grain and cotton production are the main tasks of water conservancy work at present. In recent years, we have made great efforts in water conservancy work, but every year, several million mu of land still suffer from water and drought disasters. Last year's major flood submerged an even larger area. Among them, the Jianghuai Basin is a high-yield grain-producing area, and Hebei is a technical crop-producing area with insufficient grain, and the impact is particularly great. Therefore, if we can reduce water and drought disasters every year, it is equivalent to increasing dozens of billion or hundreds of billion jin of grain. From the perspective of developing water conservancy to improve the unit area yield of agriculture, there is still a lot of potential. Improving water conservancy facilities and combining them with agricultural technology improvement and fertilization, changing dry land into irrigated land, changing paddy fields without water conservancy facilities into paddy fields with water conservancy facilities, changing single-season rice into double-season rice, can greatly increase the unit area yield. To ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, we must, according to the above policy and the specific deployment in the Five-Year Plan, continue to strive to achieve the goal of increasing grain and technical crops.

Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, has made a detailed report on the comprehensive treatment of Yellow River disasters and the comprehensive development of Yellow River water resources. This is an immortal great cause of turning a thousand-year water disaster into a great water conservancy project and changing the natural and economic appearance of the Yellow River Basin. Our ancestors often used "sea calm and river clear" to describe the ideal prosperous age, but "river clear" is still a passive thing. Only in the Mao Zedong era, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, when we began to carry out socialist construction, did we have the possibility to control the Yellow River, make it obey the will of the people, and turn it into a great driving force for the development of the national economy. We water conservancy workers are honored and excited to participate in this great construction. At present, our work is to cooperate with relevant departments to actively prepare for the comprehensive treatment and development of the Yellow River, and at the same time, to prevent the Yellow River from causing serious breaches and changes before the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. These five or six years are very important. The people of the Yellow River Basin have already seen the bright future of the Yellow River in front of them and must not let it change again in these few years. At present, we are taking measures against a once-in-200-years flood (i.e., the flow rate of Qinxian is 29,000 cubic meters per second) to further strengthen the dikes and increase temporary flood control measures, but they have not been fully completed. This year's flood control must be vigilant and strictly prevent it.

The treatment of the Huai River is also a matter of concern to the whole country. So far, five reservoirs have been built in the Huai River Basin, and two reservoirs are under construction—Nanwan Reservoir with a storage capacity of 900 million cubic meters and Meishan Reservoir with a storage capacity of 2.1 billion cubic meters. Both have been modified to a height that can intercept floods. The flood detention engineering of lakes and wetlands, including Hongze Lake, has been completed in 16 places. The important dikes protecting the northern plain of Huai and the cities of Bengbu and Huainan have been modified to above the flood level of 1954. More than ten rivers in the severely waterlogged tributary systems have been dredged and rectified. According to the above engineering situation, if we encounter the 1950 flood again, we can ensure that the main dikes will not collapse if we properly use various projects and strive to defend them. If we encounter the 1954 flood again, we can also strive to ensure that the main dikes will not collapse. The disaster of waterlogging has also been reduced in the already rectified tributaries. However, most of the newly built main dikes have not been tested by floods, and some still need to be further strengthened. Some are surrounded by water on both sides during the flood season, and in terms of defense, we still need to wage a hard battle; some upstream and midstream tributaries have not been completed, and local floods and waterlogging disasters are still inevitable.

The Huai River Basin has abundant water resources, and after the completion of all storage projects, it can make more contributions to irrigation, navigation, and power generation. Learning from the experience of the comprehensive planning of the Yellow River Basin, we feel that the past policy of comprehensive consideration of storage and discharge in the treatment of Huai River is very correct, but there are some shortcomings in the specific planning that need to be supplemented and revised. At the same time, after the test of the 1954 flood, it is proved that the flood control design standards of some projects are too low. Now we are cooperating with relevant departments to revise the comprehensive plan of the Huai River Basin.

The Yangtze River Basin, this year, combined with disaster relief, carried out the dike repair project. The total amount of earthwork reached 344 million cubic meters, and the amount of stonework reached 540,000 cubic meters. Among them, the important dikes such as the Jingjiang Great Dike, Wuhu Great Dike, Tongma Great Dike, Wuhan City Dike, Nanjing City Dike, Han River Left Dike, and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area have all been modified to above or level with the 1954 flood level. The Dongting Lake has been initially rectified. The flood control capacity has been improved compared to last year.

Regarding the treatment and comprehensive development of the Yangtze River, because the Yangtze River Basin has a vast area, a huge flow, and a relatively complex water system, it takes more time to formulate the comprehensive development plan of the Yangtze River than the Yellow River plan, and the work is more complicated and arduous. To meet the urgent requirements of disaster prevention and benefits, in the past, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Fuel Industry have been actively conducting surveys and research on navigation and hydropower issues, and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Water Conservancy has been actively conducting surveys and research on flood control and comprehensive planning issues, and has carried out some local treatment and development work; now the government has also hired a group of Soviet experts to help compile the Yangtze River Basin plan. We will cooperate with relevant departments and work actively to complete the Yangtze River Basin plan as soon as possible, so that the Yangtze River Basin can be free from flood disasters as soon as possible and gradually play its role in the development of the national economy. Its tributary, the Han River, often suffers from flood disasters. The downstream flood diversion project will begin in the second half of this year, and the preparation for the fundamental treatment will be actively carried out. Before the Yangtze River Basin plan is defined, some projects within the basin that do not conflict with the basin plan, such as some reservoir projects of tributaries, the initial treatment of Dongting Lake, and other lakes, can be carried out as appropriate if the benefits are significant and the technical preparations are mature within the Five-Year Plan.

To reduce the severe and frequent flood and waterlogging disasters in Hebei Province, solve the problem of grain increase, reduce the burden of national grain transportation, and reduce the threat of floods to Tianjin, the Haihe River system, in addition to the Yongding River which has begun to be treated, the South-to-North Canal, the Daqing River, and the Ziya River also need to be treated urgently. We are cooperating with relevant departments to compile the Haihe River Basin plan, which is expected to be completed in 1956. To allow some urgent projects to be designed and constructed earlier, the flood control and drainage plan can be proposed this year, and we will strive to start the treatment of the important tributary of the Ziya River, the Hutuo River, within the first Five-Year Plan period.

The Lia River in Northeast China will continue to build the Dapao Reservoir on the tributary of the Hun River, and compile the Lia River Basin plan. The Manas River and Urumqi River in Xinjiang will complete the basin plan from this year to next year. The Shandong, Shui, and Sui regions will complete the basin plan in 1957. Chao Lake and Tai Lake will begin to compile the basin plan. The Pearl River will first draft the downstream flood control and drainage plan and collect materials for compiling the basin plan. The Minjiang River, in addition to local treatment, will also actively conduct surveys and research. Other places, the treatment of medium and small rivers, are also of great significance in reducing water and drought disasters and increasing grain and cotton production. These works were previously undertaken by the provincial and municipal water conservancy bureaus, but we have not paid enough attention to this aspect in our leadership, and we have not done enough technical assistance in the survey and design work of river treatment in various places. In the future, the Ministry of Water Conservancy and water conservancy institutions at all levels must pay attention to this link, actively help various places to study plans, and gradually reduce local water and drought disasters. Because water conservancy work is directly related to the safety of the lives of the broad masses of people and the development of agricultural production, the people of the whole country are very concerned about water conservancy construction, and the representatives have also put forward many valuable suggestions and requirements for water conservancy work, which is a great encouragement and whip to us, and we will all seriously consider and seek appropriate solutions.

According to the above engineering situation, our arrangement for this year's flood control work is to require each place to determine the flood control standards according to the current engineering defense capabilities and defend firmly. For floods exceeding defense capabilities, temporary measures should be pre-arranged, sacrificing a small part to protect the whole, to reduce disasters. For important sections that must be guaranteed, the current engineering should be used in conjunction with temporary measures to take appropriate countermeasures against different types of floods and carry out necessary preparations. Now the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, Han River, and Northeast Songhua River and Lia River are all rising continuously; the Huabei region has also entered the flood season; some provinces have already experienced mountain floods and local flood disasters, but it is still possible to make up for them. In the next more than a month, it is the most critical time for flood control, and we must be highly vigilant and struggle to overcome this year's floods and strive for this year's bumper harvest.

To quickly increase grain and cotton production, we must also rely on the broad masses of the people to develop agricultural water conservancy throughout the country. Developing agricultural water conservancy, expanding the area of crops, and improving the unit area yield is the most effective method for the farmers of the whole country to support the socialist construction of the state, and it is also the most effective method to increase income and improve the lives of the farmers themselves. We should mobilize the broad masses of farmers to develop various kinds of agricultural water conservancy according to local conditions. Among them, small-scale agricultural water conservancy has low cost, great and quick effect, wide distribution, large quantity, and can fully utilize the labor, funds, wisdom, and experience of the masses. In the national irrigation area, small-scale water conservancy accounts for 89.4%. In the newly increased 680 million mu of irrigation area in the past five years since liberation, small-scale water conservancy accounts for more than 50 million mu, and its role in increasing grain and cotton production is particularly significant. It is necessary to strengthen technical guidance according to the principle of public assistance and utilize low-interest loans and investment assistance to lead in a planned and step-by-step manner to vigorously promote its development.

According to the typical surveys in various places, there is still a lot of room for the development of small-scale water conservancy in various places. In the southern provinces, most of the ponds and weirs can only resist drought for about 30 days, and those that can resist drought for 50 days and achieve a full harvest account for only 20% to 30%. In the northern provinces, the irrigation area in Hebei Province accounts for only 13.4% of the total cultivated land area in the province. In 57 counties suitable for well digging, only 16 counties have reached or are close to saturation, and the rest have few wells. The total cultivated land area in Shandong Province is 1.3 billion mu, and the current irrigation area accounts for only 5.7% of the total cultivated land area. According to preliminary surveys, there are about 300 million mu of cultivated land that can utilize groundwater for irrigation. If these 300 million mu of dry land can be changed into irrigated land, drought disasters can be eliminated, and production can be increased and guaranteed, this will greatly change the face of rural Shandong. We believe that in the northern well-suited areas, digging wells and installing water wheels to change dry land into irrigated land is the most practical way to increase production at present, with small investment, quick results, and easy acceptance by the masses. In the existing irrigation facilities, strengthening irrigation management, and promoting unified management and rational water use on the basis of the gradual development of mutual aid and cooperation also have a lot of potential to be tapped. The Baiquan Irrigation District in Henan Province had only 100,000 mu of irrigated land before liberation, and it has now expanded to 260,000 mu. The Fang, Lai, and Zhu canals in Hebei Province had 108,000 mu of irrigated land in 1949, and it has now expanded to 210,000 mu. In the northern well-irrigated areas, the average irrigation area per well in Shandong Province is 3.5 mu, but in areas where groundwater is not too deep, water wheels can generally irrigate 30 to 40 mu. The Five-Year Plan proposes to expand the irrigation area nationwide by 720 million mu. Excluding the 200 million mu completed in 1953 and 1954, and the 140 million mu planned to be completed in 1955, there are still 380 million mu of tasks in the next two years. We will strive to complete and strive to overfulfill this task according to the above specific conditions. Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces often suffer from water and drought disasters, and more efforts should be made to combine river treatment and strengthen agricultural water conservancy to achieve the goal of increasing grain and technical crops.

Pump stations are powerful tools for irrigation and drainage. Last year, there were 170,000 horsepower nationwide, irrigating more than 50 million mu. This year, according to incomplete statistics of 16 provinces, 27,000 horsepower have been increased, benefiting an area of more than 15 million mu. To solve the problem of oil for pumps, various places are studying the use of steam, water, electricity, and wind power to replace oil. Among them, the construction of small-scale hydropower stations in rural areas is an important direction for development. The small hydropower stations in Wangqing, Jilin, and Huanren, Liaoning, are both simple in equipment and low in cost. The Huanren power station generates 20 kilowatts and costs 250,000 yuan, which can be used as a reference for promotion in various places.

Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, has already said in detail about the importance of water and soil conservation work. The water and soil conservation of the Yellow River Basin should be the key to the whole country, and various departments and regions should cooperate to vigorously promote it. Other areas such as the upper reaches of the Yongding River, Huai River, and Luoyang River, as well as areas with serious water and soil loss in various provinces, should also strive to conduct experimental promotion. In the annual water disaster area of the country, mountain flood disasters account for a large proportion and are often sudden and cause many casualties. To fundamentally treat mountain flood disasters, we must also rely on water and soil conservation, and at the same time, we must plan to build reservoirs and small and medium-sized reservoirs to intercept floodwater. This is a very important issue that we must pay serious attention to.

Regarding the water supply for animal husbandry, the water shortage in some ethnic minority areas is urgent. We have cooperated with the geological and agricultural departments to conduct groundwater exploration in water-scarce areas of Inner Mongolia, study well digging, and then promote it. In conjunction with industrial construction, the survey and design of industrial flood control and water use are also one of our important tasks, which is related to national industrial construction, and we will definitely ensure the quality and complete it on time.

From 1950 to 1952, the total amount of funds allocated by the state for water conservancy construction was 770 million yuan, and the total amount of funds allocated for water conservancy in the Five-Year Plan is 2.49 billion yuan, which is a very large figure. If the funds from the savings item allocated to the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments and the water conservancy loans are added, the amount will be even greater. In terms of the amount of state investment, we believe that it can basically meet the most urgent needs of water conservancy construction in various places. The main problem at present is that the survey and design forces cannot keep up with the requirements of the construction plan. Therefore, in the past two years, some engineering projects were listed in the plan but could not start construction, and some engineering projects started construction with poor design and caused serious errors and waste, even affecting the completion of the overall water conservancy basic construction plan by 100%. At present, although we have established professional design institutions to carry out the planned management of water conservancy work surveys and designs nationwide, the situation has improved initially, but to complete such a huge construction plan, we still need to make arduous efforts.

In addition, there are still many shortcomings in our design, construction, and management work. In addition to the serious waste in the Dapao Reservoir pointed out by Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, the static water pool of the Yunheji Division Weir and the inlet of the lake had design defects, and it was destroyed by the flood when it was released last year, endangering the weir body, and it had to stop using it. The design water level of the Gaoliangxia Weir was too low, and during the water release period, it had to increase the pressure on the steel rails to ensure safety, and temporarily build a stone dam in the downstream to stop the water. This year, the static water pool of Yunheji Inlet Weir and the reinforcement of Gaoliangxia Weir were repaired, and more than 200 ten thousand yuan were reinvested. The Nanwan Reservoir, due to geological problems and the liquefaction problem of sand materials, had to stop work twice, delaying the construction period by more than a year, and the administrative management fee alone increased by 600,000 yuan. In 1954, a fire at the Foziling Reservoir caused a loss of 540,000 yuan. Other phenomena of material and equipment accumulation and waste, and the frequent occurrence of health and safety accidents are also common in many construction sites. In housing construction, some units also have the trend of pursuing luxurious buildings, wasting national funds. The main reasons for these phenomena are that we do not have enough awareness of the importance of thrift to socialist construction in our leadership, and we have not seriously led the work of thrift and opposition to waste. In the decision of engineering, there is also a blindly adventurous mood, and many engineering projects start construction without good design. On the other hand, the learning of advanced Soviet experience is not systematic and in-depth, and some technical cadres still have the subjective and detached from reality style. At the same time, the design and construction have not carried out professional division of labor in a timely manner, and the construction organization is temporary, and experience cannot be accumulated. These shortcomings, we have corrected some of them, and we will continue to correct some of them.

Finally, I would like to explain that our water conservancy work has a strong local and mass character. The achievements we have made in the past are inseparable from the support of the local party and government leadership, the hard work of cadres at all levels, especially grassroots cadres, and the enthusiasm of the laboring people of all places to build socialism. In the future, we will continue to work hard to complete the state's planned tasks and make full use of the rich water resources of our motherland; to make our beautiful and rich mountains and rivers, with the development of the Five-Year Plan, appear more Flowery Mountains and Rice Valleys. I would like to pay tribute to all the laboring people of the country participating in water conservancy construction and to pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, who guide us to carry out the great and unprecedented socialist construction cause.

**Title: The First Five-Year Plan and the Development of National Economy**

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

Since the first session of the First National People's Congress was held in September last year to adopt the Constitution, the Chinese people have, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, been advancing step by step according to the goals set by the Constitution. In the past year, we have achieved brilliant victories in both domestic and international aspects. In terms of domestic affairs, socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved great successes, strengthening the forces and confidence for building socialism. The convening of the second session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has further expanded the people's democratic united front, uniting the people of all ethnic groups and all strata in the country more broadly, and providing a more powerful guarantee for the completion of the state's overall task in the transitional period. In terms of international affairs, the success of the Asian-African Conference has developed the five principles of peaceful coexistence proposed by China and India, established a clear banner against colonialism, and played a major role in international affairs. It has great significance in striking at imperialism, easing international tensions, and promoting a peaceful atmosphere in the world. This is another great victory for China's peaceful foreign policy following the Geneva Conference.

Now the second session of the First National People's Congress has been convened. At the conference, I listened to Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, on the report of the first Five-Year Plan, Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Comrade Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier, on the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, and I fully agree and wholeheartedly support it. I propose that the conference unanimously adopt it. I also listened to Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, on the comprehensive plan for the prevention of Yellow River disasters and the development of Yellow River water resources, and I listened to this vivid report and felt very excited. I wish this great plan to be gradually realized, so that the Yellow River, which has caused the greatest harm to the people in history, will become a Yellow River beneficial to the people in the future.

Our first Five-Year Plan is a great cause that has never been seen in our country's history. We must prioritize the development of heavy industry. We must do this so that our country can change from a backward agricultural country to a strong socialist country. Only in this way can we have a solid foundation for national defense, and only in this way can we develop light industry and agriculture more quickly, and the living standards of the people can be generally improved. I believe that this great plan is very much in line with the wishes and demands of the people of the whole country and will undoubtedly gain the unanimous support of the representatives of all countries and the people of the whole country.

We know that the process of implementing this Five-Year Plan is arduous and difficult, but we have the courage and determination to complete it. To achieve the Five-Year Plan, we must practice thrift and oppose waste. Thrift is a fine tradition of the Chinese people, and waste not only weakens the strength of the state but is also a vicious behavior. If we do not resolutely oppose it, it will inevitably affect national construction, so I agree to launch a comprehensive thrift movement. In the past two years, the phenomenon of waste in various places across the country has been quite serious. According to Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, the report mentions that waste phenomena still exist in all aspects, whether in basic construction, production, or other economic undertakings, especially in non-production buildings, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste is still quite common and serious. This is completely correct. From my personal knowledge, just in Beijing, many grand and luxurious office buildings, auditoriums, clubs, and other non-production buildings have been built. These buildings have used a huge amount of state funds, but they are actually used less and idle more, and their use value is not great. At this time of the beginning of national construction, such non-urgent buildings should not be built. Again, the food company collects a large number of livestock, meat, fruits, and other items from various places, and due to poor management, it has caused serious losses. Just in the case of pigs, cattle, and sheep, hundreds and thousands of them die on the way and after arriving at the destination, which is shocking. Such waste phenomena, if not strictly corrected, will not be tolerated by the people. I hope that the relevant departments in charge will strictly supervise and manage, eliminate all wasteful behavior, and ensure that useful funds are invested in national production and construction.

Finally, please allow the conference to report briefly on part of the situation of a place I know. Our country has been implementing the grain procurement and supply policy for nearly two years. During this period, I have been in Beijing for most of the time and am not very familiar with the local situation. After a short visit to Shanxi this time, I feel that this policy is the only good way to solve the grain problem in the Five-Year Plan of economic construction. It not only guarantees the needs of industrial construction but also stabilizes prices. Urban residents, disaster-stricken farmers, and rural households lacking grain can also receive reasonable supplies. The majority of farmers have recognized the correctness of the procurement and supply policy and unanimously support it. But this work is arduous and complex and is a major event of the state. The cadres' experience in implementing this policy is not enough, and the farmers are not used to it. In the process of implementation, it is inevitable that some deviations will occur, so there was a period of tension. Hidden counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to spread rumors, incite farmers, kill cadres, and destroy warehouses and livestock. This proves that counter-revolutionaries hate our achievements and intend to sabotage our economic construction. We must increase vigilance and severely suppress them, and from all aspects, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, consolidate our alliance between workers and peasants, so that our motherland's great construction cause will not be harmed by counter-revolutionaries.

The people of all ethnic groups, all democratic strata, all democratic parties, and all patriotic people across the country, unite as one, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan!

**Title: The First Five-Year Plan and the Development of National Economy**
**Author: 黄炎培**
**Date: 1955-07-08**
**Page: 1**

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

I fully agree with Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, on the report of the first Five-Year Plan, and I also agree with Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, Comrade Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier, on the draft of the Military Service Law, and Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, on the comprehensive plan for the prevention of Yellow River disasters and the development of Yellow River water resources.

This great first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy stipulates that from 1953 to 1957, all industries, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, railways, transportation, communications, postal services, culture, education, health, municipal public utilities, and other sectors will increase by a certain amount within a certain period. This is a great document on nation-building after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The tasks stipulated are so heavy! So arduous! So complex! Question: Can it be guaranteed to be completed? I can confidently answer: Yes. Relying on what? Relying on the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, relying on the high enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and also relying on the boundless enthusiasm, confidence, and courage of the people of the whole country in the labor front for the state.

The first Five-Year Plan is about to be passed. After it is passed, it will become the common goal for the people of the whole country to strive for in the future. I am excited and apprehensive, and I also think of the China Democratic National Construction Association, which I participated in, and how we will complete the unprecedented great task with the people of the whole country? Effort! I and the comrades of the association must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, strive to complete the unprecedented great task stipulated by the first Five-Year Plan!

But is there no problem? I think that such an unprecedented great task, we must be full of confidence and at the same time be very careful and cautious in its execution, especially we should pay attention to the problems that may occur or have occurred in the past.

1. The Five-Year Plan in the People's Republic of China has its own characteristics, the biggest of which should be said to be the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. "The report" explains: "Due to the special historical conditions of our country, the working class and the national bourgeoisie have an alliance relationship in politics and economics." This contains such profound implications! The method is: to determine the steps of transformation, to give the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie a necessary time, to gradually accept the transformation through some necessary transitional forms, and to carefully and thoroughly consider a series of deployments for capitalist industry and commerce, to fully consider the problems of the existence of private industry and commerce, and it is indeed meticulous, taking into account all aspects, truly without any oversight, and the only requirement for them is to actively accept socialist transformation. The industrial and commercial bourgeoisie are greatly moved. However, there are still capitalists whose thoughts have not been straightened out, who are willing to accept the arrangements but are reluctant to accept the transformation. They even say: "This is good, everyone has business to do, why rush to socialist transformation?" This is a big mistake. This is just an example. In addition, there are passive, dependent, and other wrong thoughts, activities of resisting transformation, and illegal behaviors. We have loudly called for and also patiently persuaded: to honestly abide by the state laws, to be consistent in words and deeds, and to accept socialist transformation. We are determined that enterprise transformation must be combined with ideological transformation, and in the implementation of policies, any part, no matter how good the intentions, must be repeatedly and repeatedly explained and propagated, which is a point worth noting.

2. To demand the completion of tasks and the overfulfillment of tasks, indicators of struggle are set. These indicators are all based on scientific grounds, so they are practical. But in places where enterprise management work has not been completely done well, some people do not care about anything and blindly demand to break through the indicators; for this reason, in the past few years, many problems have occurred in the enterprise aspects of industry and mining. "The report" says: "Many enterprises have the phenomenon of being loose and tight and loose in the front and tight in the back when executing the plan." "Many enterprises still often have accidents and equipment accidents, causing losses." This is worth paying serious attention to. Of course, overfulfilling tasks is good. But progressive methods must be adopted: inventions and discoveries are not mentioned, if work adopts advanced experience or proposes rationalization suggestions to reduce raw materials, shorten working hours, and reduce costs, while still maintaining or improving the original quality, this is in line with the country's earnest expectations. "The report" says: "Oppose rightist conservatism, and also oppose 'leftist' adventurism." This is correct. We cannot help but think of Chairman Mao's usual instructions to us to be loyal and honest, and to seek truth from facts, which is indeed the right medicine for the disease.

The "adventurism" mentioned above is most likely to occur in the situation of "loose in the front and tight in the back," and should be noted to prevent it. "The report" advocates for the constant and thorough inspection of engineering quality to ensure the quality of the project, which is very necessary, especially in the fifth year, it must be given high attention.

3. "The report" on the total output value of agriculture and its sideline industries in the first Five-Year Plan stipulates the growth figures within the period and says: "The above indicators, although they have been reduced from the originally planned ones, are still very high because they are based on the bumper harvest year of 1952, and because the agricultural production in 1953 and 1954 did not complete the originally planned increase due to disasters, the increase task of the last three years of the Five-Year Plan has been increased. Therefore, to achieve the above indicators, we must still make great efforts." From this, it can be seen that for agriculture, of course, an increase in production is required, but how to achieve the planned increase in production? That can only be achieved by the Party and the government leading the farmers and cadres to work in a realistic manner and to carry out the policy of agriculturalization to achieve this plan.

"The report" advocates: "The state will fully support the development of agricultural production cooperatives with its financial and material strength," which is completely correct. "The report" also advocates: "While vigorously developing agricultural production cooperatives, ... it is still necessary to consider the production enthusiasm of individual farmers, to give active help and leadership to individual farmers, to tap their potential productive power, and to improve the unit area yield." This is also necessary. Because in fact, individual farmers still account for a considerable number in the rural areas of the country, actively helping and leading individual farmers is beneficial to agricultural production. On the contrary, as mentioned in the article "Fully Enthusiastically Unite Farmers Outside the Community" published in the People's Daily on July 6, the deviation that occurred in some places in agricultural production cooperatives may affect the production enthusiasm of individual farmers. Comrade Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, summarized the experience of various places at the National Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference in October 1954 and proposed four standards for running agricultural production cooperatives well, the fourth of which is: "Seriously unite and help farmers outside the community." For the relevant regulations in the "report" about the problem of agricultural increase, we must seriously implement them.

I would like to add that: regarding the grain problem in rural areas, since February, I have received many letters from the people, and I have forwarded each one to the State Council. From these letters, I saw the tense situation in these places, and I was very worried in my heart. At that time, I only relied on the reports from various places and did not have a comprehensive understanding, so my view of the grain shortage situation today is wrong. But I am always frank, and I think it is right to do so. In June, it was decided to go to Jiangsu for an inspection. Before departure, Chairman Mao gave me the instruction of "comprehensive analysis." After arriving in Jiangsu, I listened to the report of the provincial responsible comrades and went to several counties to see the general situation of the countryside and had direct conversations with the farmers. From my personal contact, I understood that the farmers' production enthusiasm was very enthusiastic; they all thought that the grain procurement and supply policy was very good. Although what I got was only a "point," combined with the provincial report, it was comprehensive in Jiangsu. At that time, the situation of supply was completely gone. In Jiangsu, even when the supply was in trouble, the province had carefully analyzed it, and the truly grain-deficient ones accounted for only about 5%. We talked to the village cadres, and they had all received the education of the Party, and all activities were correctly grasped by the Party and the government. I was greatly moved and pleased by this point. I have already written a report on the inspection of Jiangsu, and in the future, I must draw on this experience and lesson, study hard to comprehensively analyze, and be ready to correct past wrong views at any time, but I will still speak out, and I think it is right to do so. I completely agree with Comrade Chen Yun, Vice Premier's speech on the 21st.

4. We must practice thrift and must call for thrift. Just take engineering as an example, what is required is simplicity and solidity, eliminating luxury decoration, doing it solidly and firmly, without increasing the cost, and some have even extended the service life. Simplicity and solidity are combined to achieve thorough thrift. But if the meaning of thrift is misunderstood, thinking that thrift is just saving money, unconditionally changing materials to inferior ones can reduce costs, saying it is thrift; doing engineering carelessly can save manpower, saying it is thrift, this is completely wrong. The State Council's instruction on July 3, 1955, by Premier Zhou on the implementation of the thrift policy: "The main thing is ... to strive for thrift without reducing the quality of the project," this is the key. The implementation of the Five-Year Plan requires both calling for thrift and implementing strict inspections on one side. I advocate that we must fully bring into play Chairman Mao's frequent instructions to us to be loyal and honest, diligent and conscientious, and seek truth from facts to correctly implement the development of the national economy's first Five-Year Plan, and also lay a very solid and good foundation for the second and third Five-Year Plans. Comrades! Our first Five-Year Plan is such an unprecedented great plan! It will begin to change the historical face of our country's economic backwardness for a hundred years, pushing our country a big step forward to the goal of an industrialized socialist society. Let us, the Chinese people, unite as one, follow the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and as long as we execute it with full confidence but also with great care, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of our country.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    张国华代表的发言
    我完全同意并拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和几位副总理、彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。
    第一个五年计划是使我国各民族人民走向幸福的社会主义社会的第一个计划。实现这个计划将进一步巩固我国的人民民主专政，进一步加强我国的国防力量，并为进一步改善我国各族人民的物质生活和文化生活创造条件。在计划中充分注意了促进西藏地区的经济事业和文化事业的发展。今年三月，国务院关于西藏交通运输问题和关于帮助西藏地方进行建设的两项决定所规定的建设事项，以及前此康藏、青藏公路的修筑等，都是第一个五年计划的组成部分，五年计划的完成将给西藏经济文化的发展创造更好的条件，将有力地加强民族间与民族内部的团结。因此，第一个五年计划的实现是攸关西藏地区人民切身利益的事业，我们愿在西藏地区，为实现这个伟大的计划所规定的任务和要求而努力。
    我国第一个五年计划已经执行了两年多，全国各地在发展国民经济上已取得了胜利，西藏地区，在政治、经济、文化各方面工作上也获得了显著的成就。特别值得我们注意的是西藏和祖国各民族间与西藏内部团结的加强。
    去年九月，达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措和班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞代表西藏人民一同来到北京，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，参加了宪法的讨论和制定工作，并被选为国家的领导工作人员。在同一期间，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题达成协议。达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼还一道参加了国务院讨论西藏工作的会议。这是藏族人民历史上的大事。
    达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼最近已分别安全返抵拉萨、日喀则，受到各界热烈的欢迎。
    康藏公路、青藏公路已于去年十二月全线通车了。这两条公路工程的艰巨是世界闻名的。一九五○年到一九五一年，当国家处在经济恢复时期，中央就指示进藏部队、进藏工作人员修筑这两条公路。在修筑过程中，中央拨给资金近三亿余元之多，全国各地人民在人力物力和技术上给予了大力的支援，我在此表示感谢。在海拔平均三千五百公尺的高原上，在稀薄的空气和变化剧烈的气候里，进藏部队和筑路员工发挥了高度的爱国主义精神和革命的英雄主义的气魄，坚持长年的极艰苦的奋斗，终于战胜了高山、急流、冰川、流沙、森林、泥沼、严寒、风雪种种自然障碍，胜利地完成了党和政府给予的伟大的任务。在修路中出现了许多值得歌颂的英雄事迹。藏族人民和地方政府在修筑公路的支援、运输等工作中，也贡献了很大的力量（如仅昌都地区即运输了六十三万驮物资）。这两条公路工程的完成震动了世界，这是中国人民向世界表现了他们在与大自然斗争中的勇敢和智慧的一个范例。
    康藏公路、青藏公路的通车，大大地改变了西藏地方和外界交通不便的情况，加强了藏族与祖国其他民族的团结，为各地支援西藏的建设创造了条件，巩固了我国西南边疆的国防。
    就公路通车后西藏地方经济情况来看，显著的变化是各大城镇物资供应的充足和物价的稳定。昌都、拉萨、黑河、日喀则的市场上已出现了祖国内地制造的工业品（在昌都这类商品已占市场上商品总数的百分之九十以上），经过国营贸易公司，它们还行销到西藏边僻的山区。各大城镇的日用必需品价格平均比通车前降低了百分之十五，居民生活有了改善。沿着公路，过去荒凉的地方出现了新的繁荣的市镇。
    人民热爱公路，因为这两条公路解决了他们交通的困难，带来了祖国各地人民对西藏人民的关怀和帮助。在康藏公路最后的一项四百多公尺的大工程拉萨河的大桥已在今年二月竣工，八十多公尺的第一期水面工程仅费了十二天的时间；汽车队第一次驶过桥梁的那天，拉萨居民争着挤上大桥。有的向桥祷告，把它叫做毛主席的桥。有的惊讶地说：“过去做梦不敢想到的事，今天实现了。”现在桥栏上挂满了哈达和经旗，随风飘动着，在这上面寄托着藏族人民对桥梁的真挚的朴素的爱慕。
    去年七月十四日夜，西藏江孜地区冰川决裂，引起了年楚河河水泛滥，卷去许多村庄，蔓延到四个宗（县）的土地。洪水突然来到时，驻当地的部队和工作人员，在洪流冲击中，首先抢救藏族人民和藏族人民的物资。有两位战士为此献出了自己的生命。第二天洪水一退，军区立即拨出军粮赈济。负责干部和工作人员全体不分昼夜地为救济灾民而紧张地工作。他们对灾民的友爱关切，深深地感动了藏族人民。普遍反映：“中国人民解放军不自私自利，能舍身救人。”中央人民政府闻讯迅速拨给巨款救济，在进藏部队机关中也展开了捐献运动（共捐献了十二万银元，有的战士捐出了三个月的津贴）。在中央的关怀下，西藏地方政府，班禅堪布会议厅委员会和西藏军区共同组织了救灾委员会，进行了发放衣服、粮食、耕牛、生产工具，组织以工代赈等工作，帮助灾民安家生产。初步统计，平均灾民每人分配到价值五十元的救济物资。由于救济的迅速、及时，灾民生活生产很快地得到稳定。
    中国人民解放军进藏部队，进藏工作人员几年来正确地执行了毛主席的民族政策和宗教政策，尽可能地帮助藏族人民改善生活，因而逐渐地取得藏族人民的信任。这几年的工作和生活，已使我们大多数同志对西藏人民、西藏地方树立了深厚的情谊。过去进军、筑路以及今天的各种工作中，西藏人民给予了我们以大力的援助；我们深信，以藏族人民的勇敢、智慧和勤劳精神以及西藏地方资源的丰富，在祖国的建设事业中，藏族人民将有更大的贡献。我们愿意为帮助西藏人民长期建设西藏和保卫祖国的边疆，安心在西藏工作。
    此外在贸易、银行、干部培养、医疗卫生等方面都有显著的成就。
    这一切工作的成绩都是在中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席的英明的领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的团结和支持下，在全国人民的支援下，在和西藏僧俗人民共同努力下取得的。
    西藏的工作虽然有很大的成绩，但我们仍有不少缺点。一部分进藏人员中仍存在着不同程度的大汉族主义的思想的残余，不同程度地影响了民族团结。有些干部因为工作有了成绩而发生了骄傲自满。少数干部缺乏高度的爱国主义觉悟，不安心于长期建藏工作。工作中还有时出现急躁情绪。在机关部队的开支上、在筑路的勘察工作上，存在过浪费现象。对于这些缺点和错误，我们曾进行了检查、教育和纠正，今后仍须警惕，防止。
    第一个五年计划向国内各民族提出了巩固团结，加强合作，积极地参与整个国家的政治生活和经济建设的要求。本此精神，在西藏地区我们应该为加强藏族和祖国其他民族的团结，完满实现西藏区域自治而努力奋斗。
    西藏地区的蕴藏是很丰富的，农牧业生产都有广阔的发展前途。此后，我们还要继续开展富源的调查工作，加强农牧业生产，尤其注意发展畜牧业工作。
    今年是第一个五年计划的第三年度了。达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼回到西藏后，西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作即将开始进行。遵照国务院的决定，康藏公路已开始养护整修工作。拉萨到日喀则公路已经完成勘察工作，江孜到日喀则公路正在兴修。西藏工程勘察队已抵达拉萨；全国各地正向西藏输送大批的技术人员。参加建设，我相信此后三年内西藏地区一定会完成第一个五年计划所规定的任务。
    我庆祝发展国民经济的第一个五年计划编制完成，并预祝其全部实现。
    王文山代表的发言
    在这次会议上听了李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，我心里有说不出来的兴奋和愉快。这些报告都是为了使我国广大劳动人民永远再不过那种穷苦日子，都是为了建设我们自己和我们子子孙孙的幸福生活，都是为了使我国逐步走向美好的社会主义社会。因此，我全心全意地拥护这些报告，并决心为实现这些报告中规定的各项任务而奋斗。
    我是一个机器制造业工人，我特别对第一个五年计划规定的机器制造工业任务感到高兴。第一个五年计划草案指出：“机器制造工业是对国民经济进行技术改造的主导力量”。在第一个五年计划中，国家要求我们大量地试制与制造各种各样的最新技术的质量好与成本低的机械设备与金属切削机床，以供给许多新建扩建的工业、交通运输等企业的需要，并提高机器制造工业的技术水平。这个任务是艰巨的，但是我们有信心完成。因为有党和人民政府的正确领导，有伟大苏联政府和苏联专家在物质上与技术上的无私援助，尤其我们广大职工有着为建设自己美好生活的劳动积极性与创造性。我们完全能够克服一切困难，保证完成任务。这从我们沈阳第一机床厂的工作中，也可以证明这一点。我们的工厂在解放时是一个设备异常落后、根本不能生产完整机床的旧企业，由于我们在党的领导下，克服了各种困难，很快就正式生产皮带车床和全齿轮车床。从一九五三年开始执行第一个五年计划以来，又逐步制造苏式牛头刨床和苏式一Д六三、一Д六五等型的新式车床，我们还是在一面扩建一面生产的情况下试制与制造这些新产品的。现在我们工厂在苏联专家的无私帮助下，很快就要完成扩建任务。今后我们准备大量生产的、也是机器制造工业所迫切需要的一A六二型苏式车床，也已经试制成功，正开始进行小批生产。这些事实充分说明，我们机器制造业职工在党的领导下，充分发挥自己的劳动积极性与创造性，努力学习苏联，提高技术，是能够胜利完成第一个五年计划规定的任务的。
    但是，我们决不能骄傲自满，应该看到我们的任务是十分艰巨的，我们工作中的缺点和错误是很多的。拿我们工厂来说，由于技术水平低，缺乏企业管理经验，单在生产方面，今年上半年就给国家损失浪费了一百七十多万元的财富，其中废品浪费六十七万多元，停工损失五十八万多元，材料工具等方面的浪费四十多万元；在产品质量方面还存在着许多缺点。至于工厂基本建设和机器安装方面的浪费就更大了。如果不克服这些缺点和错误，势必影响国家计划的完成。
    现在我们工厂根据党和国家经济机关的指示，已经开展了增产节约运动，我们制定的增产节约计划，到今年年底：一Д六三车床增产百分之七，降低成本百分之七；正在开始进行小批生产的一A六二型车床增产一倍，降低成本百分之二十；各项产品均要提高质量，使废品的损失浪费降低百分之三十五；还要减少停工的损失浪费。总计今年全年可为国家增产节约四百一十多万元的财富。
    为了保证完成国家计划和增产节约计划，根据国家第一个五年计划和李富春副总理的报告，我决心和我们全厂职工共同努力做好以下的工作：
    一、切实学习苏联先进经验和认真贯彻苏联专家建议，努力提高技术水平。目前我们的技术水平很低，有些苏联援助的生产设备和技术安全设备，我们还不会使用，甚至还没有正式进行生产就把机器搞坏了。提高技术是我们当前的一个重要任务。提高技术的唯一有效方法是切实学习与贯彻苏联的技术资料，特别是切实贯彻苏联给我们厂设计的全套工艺规程和认真执行苏联专家建议。提高了技术水平，就可以不断改善产品质量、不断提高劳动生产率和减少人身与设备事故。
    二、按照社会主义企业管理原则，改进企业管理，努力提高管理水平。苏联帮助我们工厂作了全套的组织设计，并有苏联专家直接指导。但是我们还没有充分利用这种有利条件，建立起正规的管理制度。目前在技术上、物资上存在着许多无人负责现象，作业计划不健全，生产准备工作也注意不够，因而造成产品质量低、次品废品多、损失浪费严重，以及停工待料、突击赶工等恶果。今后必须切实按照组织设计，健全责任制度，加强计划管理与技术管理，并贯彻经济核算制度。我是一个车间管理负责人，我决心依靠群众，按月把各项计划指标下达到工段和个人，逐步实行班组经济核算，同时建立制定昼夜班作业计划的制度，加强生产前的准备工作，从而逐步作到有节奏地生产。
    三、广泛开展劳动竞赛。围绕解决生产关键问题鼓励职工群众提合理化建议，及时总结与推广先进经验，特别要有计划地学习苏联先进经验；发动职工群众经常自下而上地开展批评，以监督生产计划、安全技术措施计划以及生活福利措施计划的实现，向一切损失浪费现象和官僚主义作风作斗争。还要动员职工在劳动竞赛中提高警惕，严防反革命分子破坏，随时揭发和检举反革命分子，使这些坏蛋无处藏身。
    我决心在我的工作岗位上，虚心向群众学习并带领群众作好这些工作，以保证超额完成国家计划。
    谢觉哉部长的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理兼计划委员会主任关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理兼财政部长关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在请允许我就第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以后，国家机关工作中的救济工作作一简要的发言。
    我在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上说过，一九五四年长江、淮河的洪水是近百年来少有的，我们防洪和抢救的成绩是历史上没有的。当我们正在进行水灾地区的救济和恢复工作的时候，这些地区冬季又遭受了近百年来少有的寒潮大雪。淮河、汉江甚至洞庭湖都被封冻，水上、陆上的交通都因冰雪阻绝，堵口复堤和农业、副业生产被迫停顿。许多民房被压塌，冬种作物被冻死。这是灾上加灾，因而加重了今年的春荒和夏荒。由于党和政府的正确领导，广大干部和群众的努力，在人民政府统一领导下不分地域地协同斗争，灾荒虽然异常严重，但终于被我们战胜了。保护了灾区人民的生命，恢复了灾区人民的生产。据报告，安徽、湖北、江苏、江西等重水灾省，除了房子被水冲去后临时架设的住所需要改建外，已看不出灾象。堤防修复，耕牛、农具、种子基本够用；人民有吃、有穿；生产情绪很好。
    为什么能取得这样的效果呢？首先是党和人民政府救灾政策的正确贯彻和全国人民的一致支援。国家今年拨出的救济款达一亿九千六百多万元，连去年大水以后拨出的共达四亿元；拨到水灾各省的贷款也达一亿八千多万元。一面救济缺粮灾民，供给生活上需要的物资；一面向灾区运送种籽、耕牛，解决春耕生产中的困难。调剂收购并运到灾区的耕牛，仅湖北、湖南、江西、安徽四省即达十万头；为了不误农时，除用火车、船只运送物资外，在中国人民解放军协助下，还用登陆艇赶运。湖北省三十一个县帮助灾民添置、修补农具四十五万余件，恢复到灾前原有数的百分之七十到八十。由于筑堤的物资和人力由各地及时运到，使数达三万九千九百万土方长的堤防能在春耕前完成。去冬今春国家经济部门投到安徽、河北、河南等省的预购、收购、加工等款项共达三亿三千五百多万元，使灾区的副业生产得到发展。同时国家又对灾区的农业税认真地实行减免，去年全国减免农业税共达六十亿斤，占应征总额的百分之十五。湖北省秋季农业税征收指标是十四亿五千九百万斤，灾后减免达七亿一千万斤。安徽省是十一亿三千七百万斤，灾后减免达三亿七千七百万斤。对灾区农民的农业税减免了，运到灾区的粮食却源源不断。因而人民感激地说：
  “百年未有的大水灾，千年未有的好政府”。
    其次，是各级党政人员特别是基层干部、积极分子和人民群众的共同努力。他们在做了防汛抢险和灾民大转移工作之后，接着又向寒潮大雪进行不倦的英勇斗争。成千上万的干部，率领群众破冰、扫雪、架桥，恢复水陆交通，把灾民需要的物资源源运到灾区。对灾民逐村逐户的查访急救，发款发衣，搭盖和修补房屋。在安徽省东流县新庭乡，中共支部书记江西山，去年防汛时，成天坚持在江堤上，抢险救人，后来又带领灾民上山开荒，病了仍坚持工作；这次大雪，他又带病到各村挨户检查急救，在雪坑和冰上爬行，毫不退缩，并把群众评给他的救济款拨给了别人。桐城县扬桥区花山被雪封住，干部背着衣服、粮食上山急救，第一天因雪大山陡，未爬上去，第二天干部手拉手，不避艰险，终于爬上山去，抢救了山顶断炊的灾民。湖北省江陵县民主乡副乡长冯绍斌，经过十五里冰湖，跌倒十多次，衣服结满冰，仍坚持把粮食送到灾民手中。寒潮过后，他们又忘我地帮助灾民搞耕牛、搞种子、搞耕种计划，开展副业，分配救济粮款，许多区乡干部在春节期间也不休息。由于这些干部本身就是劳动人民，越是困难的时候就越和人民紧紧地在一起，同艰共苦，不知疲劳地工作，因而团结了人民群众，激起了人民群众的积极性。据商务印书馆出版的“中国救荒史”记载：一九三一年汉口水位比一九五四年尚低二公尺多的水灾，死亡了三百七十万人，一九二七到一九二九年三年没有特大的灾，共死亡了一千万人，而一九五四年的水灾被淹死砸死的只及一九三一年死亡人数的千分之一。又据历史记载，遭受像这样重大灾害的地方，常常几年以至几十年不能恢复，而我们几个月就恢复了。这些成绩的取得，一方面是由于中国共产党的正确领导和人民政权制度的优越性，另一方面也是同各级党政军的干部特别是基层干部的努力分不开的。在这水灾救济已告结束的时候，我们要向参加防汛抢险、救灾工作和参加恢复生产工作的干部表示慰问和感谢！向艰苦奋斗的人民群众表示慰问和感谢！因防汛抢险及其他救济工作而英勇牺牲的同志，永垂不朽！
    第三，是粮食统购统销政策的实施。从去年七月到今年六月这个粮食年度，供应灾区粮食达一百零六亿斤，供应灾区的种子一亿四千余万斤，这是多么惊人的数字。遭受水灾的各省平常年景都是有多余粮食外调的，而现在都要大量调入。调入的粮食都经过长远的道路，要花费很大的力气。如果不是国家实行了计划收购和计划供应的政策，那末，即使有救济款子，买不到粮，灾民仍不免一死。如果国家没有掌握粮食，依靠粮商贩运，救济款子至少要被私商剥削一半，灾民也不知要死多少。现在则灾情不论怎样紧张，粮价始终平稳，粮食能按时按定额发到灾民手中。灾民说：“溃了垸子米不涨价，只有共产党领导实行了统购统销才能做得到”。这一事实再一次有力地证明了粮食统购统销政策的正确和伟大。
    第四，水灾各省很重视救济款的发放和管理工作。在发放工作上，一般贯彻了“领导掌握与民主评议相结合”的原则。湖南省把全灾地区有困难的灾户分为全救户、半救半贷户、全贷户，分别予以救济或贷款；发放时，干部先掌握大体情况，提出初步意见，再交群众评议，然后经乡人民代表大会审查定案，报区批准。江苏省的发放：一、层层摸底，做到心中有数；二、层层打通思想，做到讲清政策；三、层层作生产计划，做到救济与生产密切结合。评议的方法，先选择一些户做标准户，然后自报互评，直到群众都满意时，再报区批准。在救济款管理方面，许多省建立了“专人、专款、专账”的财务管理制度。湖南、江苏两省救济指标由县控制，乡负责评议，区负责审查和发放，由区的银行机构和供销合作社定期地分别发款、发粮。由于实行了这些办法，积压、挪用、贪污、浪费救济款的现象大大减少。
    今年的救灾工作，还有不少缺点。这些缺点是：在重视重灾区的同时，往往忽视了轻灾区。在重视大块水灾区的同时，往往忽视了某些省的部分灾区。因此，那里的救灾工作，时紧时松，甚至被其他工作挤掉；没有把救济款的发放当做一件深入群众的细致工作来做，发放不及时，或不适当，积压挪用的事仍不断发生。因此有些地区仍发生了一些不应发生的事。尽管这是个别的、发觉后已立即检查补救，但救灾工作的主管部门——内务部未能事先掌握情况向地方提出警告并切实加以工作上的督促，是不应该的，今后必须努力纠正。
    城市救济工作，几年来也获得相当成绩。国民党反动统治在城市里遗留下的乞丐多、妓女多、窃盗多、游民多的现象，已经基本消灭，严重的贫困失业现象，也在逐年减少。几年来我们收容了乞丐、妓女、窃盗、游民以及无依无靠的残老孤幼达三十七万五千余人，经过教养改造后，用介绍就业、帮助自谋生活、遣送回乡等办法，安置了二十五万六千余人。对缺乏劳动力的贫民，进行了定期的和临时的救济，对暂时不能就业的失业人员，也进行了必要的救济。对一般贫民并尽可能地帮助他们进行生产。据广东、福建等九省和北京、天津等三十二个市的统计，在政府帮助下组织起来参加生产的贫民有五十七万余人。国家每年用在城市救济工作上的事业费，约在五千万元以上。随着国家经济建设的发展，就业人数的增多，需要救济的人数逐年减少。一九五二年需要救济的有二百万人，一九五三年降到一百二十万人，一九五四年已降到九十万人。
    但旧社会遗留下来的贫困失业现象，需要经过相当长的时间，依靠国家的社会主义建设事业的逐步发展，才能够得到彻底的解决。几年来我们在城市救济工作中，虽然取得了不少的成绩，但今后仍然需要我们作很大的努力。
    张友渔代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在，我只就粮食计划供应、精简节约、中小学教育、城市游民等问题，根据北京市的情况，发表一些意见。
    关于粮食计划供应问题：北京市过去的粮食销售工作，掌握松，漏洞多，浪费大，奸商投机倒运情况相当严重。从郊区农村情况来看，主要问题也是掌握太松而不是太紧，许多不该供应的也供应了，该少供应的多供应了。例如东郊高碑店乡就有余粮户和自给户三十户多买粮食两千七百多斤。因此，一九五四年七月到一九五五年六月的粮食销售量突破了国家的计划指标。今年一月到四月，较一九五四年同期人口增加百分之十四点九四，而粮食销售量则增加了百分之二十八点四五，粮食销售量的增长，超过了人口的增长。这说明有一部分粮食是被浪费、囤积或投机倒运了。为了杜绝浪费、走漏，以节约粮食，必须加强对粮食计划供应的管理。几个月来，我们除大力展开宣传外，首先，对机关、学校、厂矿企业等集体伙食单位，实行了按月编制用粮计划的制度。由于多数单位首长负责，群众拥护，执行结果，颇有成效。从六月份起，我们又对一般居民也普遍实行按户核实供应的办法。现在，粮食销售量已有所减少，六月份较四月份下降百分之十七点八一，而每户每人吃用的粮食不但不感觉不够，而且有不少户，仍较宽裕。此外，几年来北京市人口增加很快，较解放时增加了百分之七十五，只今年一月到四月，就增加了十五万。在这些新增加的人口中，有不少是在原籍有地或有业，而到北京却无事可干的（也有一些是逃亡地主、土豪恶霸和其他反革命分子）。长此下去，就会养成一批寄生虫和二流子，对国家、对他们自己都没有好处。应该让他们回原籍生产，参加社会主义建设，减少城市粮食消费，避免城市人口过分集中带来的许多困难。我们计划一九五五年七月到一九五六年六月的粮食销售量，从国家计划指标十五亿五千万斤中，减少三亿斤。节约粮食、核实供应，不仅对国家，而且对每一个克勤克俭过日子的市民都有好处，只是对奸商、奸贩不利。只要我们做好宣传工作、组织工作，并防止工作中的偏差，我们的计划是可能完成的。
    关于精简节约问题：首先，机构臃肿、层次重叠、编制庞大、人浮于事的现象，在北京市行政机关和企业、事业单位中，也严重地存在着。这是由于刚解放的时候，我们把原有人员“包下来”，同时有些领导干部又有一种“人多好办事”的想法，而我们对增加工作人员控制得也不严，加以经过几年来工作经验的积累，工作人员熟练了，效率提高了，这种现象也就突出地表现出来。这不仅大大地浪费了人力，增加了行政开支和企业的管理费用，而且助长了我们原已严重的官僚主义、文牍主义的发展，障碍着工作的改进。我们根据中央指示，自三月中旬起，开始了精简工作，现在，市级行政部门已经结束，市级各单位的附属机构和各厂矿企业也在进行中。从这些单位精简的结果看，有能够精简四分之一的，有能够精简三分之一到二分之一的，也有能够精简二分之一以上的。例如市级政府系统四十二个单位七千二百六十人中，精简了三千一百四十四人，即百分之四十三，其中，有二十二个单位精简二分之一左右，二个单位精简百分之六十以上；市级二十四个单位的附属机构二万九千六百十四人中，初步精简了七千八百二十二人，即百分之二十六，石景山钢铁厂、发电厂和清河制呢厂等三个单位共可精简四分之一；建筑材料工业局所属各厂共有职工三万一千多人，可精简一万人，即百分之三十三。对于精简后，多余人员的处理，我们采取的办法是：除拿一部分去充实其他需人单位特别是基层单位和病、老、残废另行处理外，在厂矿企业实行增加班次、组织轮班学习，以等候国家调配，在行政机关实行以三个月或半年为一期，分批学习，轮流工作，一旦国家需要，就可随时调用；事业单位则按照性质，分别采用厂矿企业或行政机关的办法。这样做，虽不能马上减少人员和开支，但可以提高干部和职工的政治、业务和文化、技术水平，从而改进工作、提高生产。并且，随着国家建设事业的扩大和发展，就可把轮流学习的多余的干部和工人成班成组地调出去，逐步达到精简的目的。
    其次，北京市在基本建设、厂矿企业、城市建设等各方面，都曾存在严重的浪费现象。有些工厂的垃圾堆变成了“聚宝盆”，钢铁等物什么都有；有些工地竟出现所谓“无人仓库”，建筑材料到处抛弃；地方工业局所属七十九个单位，今年第一季度因质量不好造成的损失达四十三万元；食品公司去年四月至十二月，猪的病、死损失竟达四百零五万斤，相当于全市三十天的食用量，价值约一百三十万元。特别是在民用建筑方面，虽然一九五四年，从设计到施工，都较过去有显著改进，一九五四年十月份各工种平均劳动生产率，较一九五三年的试行劳动定额提高百分之四十四，建筑造价较一九五四年国家颁布的设计预算定额降低百分之六点八，但由于受了以所谓“民族形式”为掩护的反动的复古主义和形式主义的影响，浪费仍极严重。像李富春副总理所指出：单就“大屋顶”来说，北京市内各机关建筑的三十九座房屋，即因此浪费了五百四十万元。我们过去虽曾根据中央指示，反对过所谓民族形式，并且再三反对过复古主义，但在一九五三年秋季后，对有些建筑却采取了自由主义态度，没有采取及时的、有效的措施。而且有少数工作人员还暗中以种种形式提倡，并推动甚至勉强业主采用“大屋顶”的建筑形式，这是一种极严重的错误，应该深刻检讨。今后，我们当切实执行国务院的指示和李富春副总理报告中所提出的办法，坚决反对和克服建筑中的浪费现象。对其他方面的节约，我们也采取了一系列的措施，要求他们完成或超额完成国家规定的指标。例如各厂矿可较国家计划成本再降低百分之三到百分之五；市政工程可降低成本百分之五到百分之十五。
    关于中小学教育问题：六年来北京市中小学有了很大的发展，一九五四年中等学校学生达十二万一千多人，较一九四八年增加了一点四二倍，小学生达三十万零四千三百四十人，较一九四八年增加了一点五八倍。但由于我们没有在发展学校数量的同时，采取切实有效的措施来提高质量，因而一九五三年全市高中毕业生投考高等学校的，有一大批成绩不到六十分，高小毕业生投考初中的，也有一大批不及格。为了改变这种状况，我们从去年下半年以来，即采取了一系列的措施，把提高质量做为中小学教育工作的重点。经过一年来的努力，教员的教学质量和学生的学习质量已普遍有所提高。教师认真教学，学生认真学习，全市中、小学出现了新气象。我们认为，为了进一步提高质量，无论教师和学生，都必须紧张地、艰苦地钻研和学习，那种以为不经过努力，不用下苦功，就可以教好、学好的看法是错误的。但在提高质量的工作中，必须同时注意师生的健康，不使他们负担过重。我们过去虽也注意到这一方面，但在执行中却有很多缺点。初中三年级以上的学生课业负担就过重。加以学生课外活动也过多。这就使得学生不能得到充分的休息，影响了健康。这也是必须纠正的。现在学生负担过重的现象虽然有所减轻，但仍须继续加以克服。
    关于城市游民问题：北京市解放以来，我们对历代反动统治阶级遗留下来的大批寄生人口，还没有来得及彻底处理。现在还存在着许多怕吃苦而不愿参加劳动的游手好闲的寄生分子和二流子；还有一批旧社会遗留下来的污毒，如小偷、骗子、流氓、地痞等，严重危害着社会治安。我们认为：这是我们建设社会主义的国家所不能容许的，必须采取坚决有效的措施，结合国家移民垦荒计划，逐步从首都迁移出去，组织他们从事农业生产，使他们有可靠的生活来源，并在劳动过程中彻底加以改造。
    黄火青代表的发言
    我热烈拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。完全同意并拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在我就天津的具体情况和当前任务，发表以下意见，请大家指正。
    在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划建设中，由于经济上和国防上的考虑，天津不是发展的重点，但作为一个原有工业基地，它有条件有责任支援国家社会主义大建设，它在积累资金，培养技术力量，供应设备以及生产更多、更好、更廉价的商品以满足人民生产和生活的需要上，担负着重大的任务。过去是这样做了，今后还应作更大努力。几年来，天津的工人阶级和全体劳动人民在中央的正确领导下，基本上完成了国家交付的任务，生产上逐年超额完成国家计划。但是工作上的缺点和问题也不少，比较突出应该马上解决的，是两个问题：一个是反对浪费、厉行节约问题；另一个是继续坚决镇压反革命、保卫社会主义建设问题。
    天津市在基本建设、工业、商业、机关生活各方面的浪费现象是相当严重的。其所以如此，主要由于我们的政治思想教育不够。未能使广大干部和工人群众深刻认识到社会主义建设事业是一个艰苦斗争的过程，因而自觉地兢兢业业地工作；未能把爱护国家财产，集中一切可能的物质力量用于国家的社会主义建设的思想，深入地向每一干部和工人宣传教育，以致在干部中滋长着一种自满情绪、保守思想和铺张浪费的作风，对国家财产缺乏应有的高度负责精神。其次，我们在经济工作中，计划管理的水平还较低。不少领导人员还摸不清工作的规律，心中无数，盲目性还大，在某些方面还缺乏一些必要的制度，或虽有制度而没有认真贯彻执行。缺乏必要的检查监督，或虽有检查监督而不严、不紧。
    由于以上原因，在基本建设上就发展了过分讲究表面装饰，要求过高标准，盲目加大安全系数，估计偏高偏大的现象。大屋顶之风也盛行一时，造成很大的浪费。天津市设计公司成立以来，设计了约一亿元的工程任务，最保守的估计是浪费百分之十到十五，即浪费一千万到一千五百万元，还未算入施工方面的浪费。
    在生产方面不少企业领导人员只注意生产计划的完成，忽视全面的经营管理。对生产车间管得多，对供销、仓储部门过问得少；抓产值产量多，抓成本财务少。“宽打窄用”的保险思想，“企业大、经验少、浪费一点不可避免”的自我原谅思想，“企业问题多得很，浪费不足为奇”的思想是相当多的。很多工厂原材料消耗定额保守（即偏高），供销部门盲目采购造成的原材料、工具的积压现象严重。仅四个较大的机器制造工厂，超储备的原材料、工具，及在制品即达五百万元。
    对工人爱护原材料的教育不够，加以缺乏必要的管理和控制，“干什么，蹧蹋什么”，造成很大浪费。地方国营天津罐头食品厂仅仅因为骨头上的肉没有剔干净和抛洒地下，两个月就浪费猪肉三万七千多斤，价值三万二千多元。电线厂第一车间倒在院内的锡土堆成小山，工人从部分锡土中已炼出五吨锡来。
    由于技术管理上缺乏一些必要的制度，或有制度而未认真执行，技术上掌握不住，事故多，报废大，这种浪费，常常一下就造成很大的损失。例如橡胶二厂一次配方错误，就报废橡胶七吨之多。
    私营工业在上述各方面的浪费尤为严重。
    商业方面在业务经营上也存在着盲目性，对市场供产销情况及人民需要缺乏经常、细致的调查研究，不少领导人员心中无数，家底不清，以致盲目进货，造成积压，浪费国家资金。中国百货公司天津市公司不顾销量，盲目大量采购罐头食品，使这种有保用期的商品大量积压，过期变质，只贬价出售一项，就损失二十三万元。另一方面确有许多商品不能按时进货，形成脱销。
    在机关、企业的编制上，不少地方由于对工作发展的前途估计不足，加上盲目追求大规模，在用人行政上又缺乏必要的严格控制，以致机构庞大，人浮于事。有些工厂管理人员及非生产人员占工厂总人数的百分之三十以上，有的工地管理人员及非生产人员占职工总数的百分之四十以上。在机关、企业中讲究排场，喜欢购买高级设备用品的现象也不少。
    根据天津的情况，我们坚决拥护中央厉行节约的方针，坚决贯彻中央关于厉行节约的具体措施。在工业方面加强成本财务管理和技术管理，提高工人的技术水平，研究原材料的节约、回收、代用等方法；在商业方面加速资金周转，减低商品流转费用，改进仓储保管工作；精简编制，严格禁止铺张浪费。此外还推行以下方法，争取更大的节约：
    1、组织同行业的技术力量，比较同行业内不同企业的优缺点，总结和推广先进技术经验，具体帮助各厂解决技术问题。例如橡胶业今年通过专业会议制定了一些提高质量、节约生胶的措施。执行结果，一至五月份十四个橡胶厂节约生胶十一万斤，如继续贯彻推广，六至十二月，橡胶业还可节约生胶三十八万斤。这种办法比过去的推广先进经验前进了一步，因为它不仅是介绍，还组织技术力量去帮助。
    2、把工业和贸易部门的力量组织在一起，共同研究适当改变某些产品的规格，去掉不必要的包装，改进配方，在不影响质量的条件下，争取节约。例如停止做红光硫化蓝，改做蓝光硫化蓝，仅仅新民化工厂和华北化工厂下半年就可节约八千四百元，染色的质量也比过去提高。加强企业之间的协作，也可以节约，如天津造纸总厂把供应人民造纸一厂的浆版改为直接供苇浆，在天津造纸厂可以节约抄制浆版的费用，在人民造纸一厂下半年就可节约一万七千五百元。这种办法需要按品种具体地研究。
    3、在群众中有计划地推广班组经济核算制。班组经济核算制实际上就是一种班组节约帐，它是一种简单易行的使节约真正为群众所掌握，从而能有效地降低成本的方法。橡胶三厂去年上半年亏胶一万五千六百多斤，下半年群众控制了消耗定额，不但补上亏欠，并节约了一万一千多斤生胶。这种事实是很多的。
    今年实行节约的结果，粗略计算，全市各方面可为国家节约七千万元，经过深入发动群众，还可能超过。但由于工作做得不够，节约的潜力一定还很大。我们有决心继续努力，经常地长期地厉行节约，为国家动员和积累更多的资金而努力。
    关于继续镇压反革命问题。天津是沿海的重要交通枢纽，首都的门户。解放以来我们进行了镇压反革命运动和肃清反动会道门的斗争，主要地打击了那些在反动统治时代作恶多端、在人民面前无法隐瞒的反革命分子；但还有不少暗藏的或采取两面手法混入我们内部的反革命分子还没有被我们发现和清除。根据天津情况：第一、长期隐蔽的和外地逃来的反革命分子还有一个相当大的数字。他们多已改名换姓，伪造历史，隐藏在工作基础薄弱的方面或复杂的地区，有的已混入我内部，窃据了重要职位。前市政建设委员会技术员王立初原系匪王凤岗部中校参谋，负有三条人命的血债，解放后伪造历史，混入我内部达四年之久。胡风分子阿垅、芦甸等人亦采取两面手法隐蔽其非法活动。第二、以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义势力和蒋介石匪帮间谍特务机关，对天津地区的派遣活动自解放以来从未放松过。过去已破获的王明武、乔振东和屈鸿祺等特务破坏案就是证明。第三、郊区土改时，发动群众不够，对反革命残余势力未能给以致命的打击，使一部分反革命分子漏网，逍遥法外。第四、几年来不少机关、企业、学校发展很快，甚至到外地各处招收人员，没有经过严格的审查，也混进来一批反革命分子。第五、国民党多年的反动统治在社会上遗留下的一批流氓、窃盗、抢匪、窝主、诈骗犯、烟毒犯、走私犯。有的该受惩罚的还没有受到应有的惩罚；有些并且仍然怙恶不悛，他们的刑事犯罪案件有逐渐增多之势。此外，在社会主义改造的尖锐斗争中，坚决抗拒改造的分子和反革命分子结合起来的事实也不止一次地被发现。
    上述这些反革命分子的活动是猖狂的。他们针对共产党和人民政府的每一重大措施和国际形势的变化，进行各种反动宣传，造谣诬蔑，写恐吓信，利用各种机会制造骚动事件，甚至行凶杀人。在工厂企业中则制造破坏事故。他们的主要破坏手段是在设计、计划、化验、技术指导中，利用技术职权，制造差错；在机器检修安装过程中，故意拖延积压，拒绝执行苏联专家建议，违反操作规程，或盗窃经济情报，制造各种差错，如错拨、错运、错算等等。不少刑事犯罪分子同反革命分子紧密地勾结起来，进行反革命破坏活动。这些刑事犯罪分子和反革命分子是美蒋派遣特务的现成依靠力量和可靠的吸收对象。其中有些并且原来就和他们有勾结。
    天津几年来的情况证明，敌人并不因我们革命政权的日益胜利和巩固而销声敛迹。恰恰相反，正是由于斗争的尖锐深入，他们愈要作垂死的挣扎。当着总路线公布后，全国人民开始进行大规模的社会主义建设的时候，他们的活动就更加猖獗起来。对反革命分子不采取坚决镇压的方针，将造成严重的后果。我们坚决拥护政府逮捕潘汉年和胡风的措施，坚决拥护肃清我们内部一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    但是现在在部分干部中，却滋长着一种极端危险的太平麻痹思想，忘记了帝国主义还在包围着我们，看不到当前阶级斗争的尖锐化，看不到反革命分子的破坏活动。这种太平麻痹思想乃是政治上的一种右倾表现。有的反革命分子，很早就发现其投递恐吓信，但是没有加以逮捕。有的反革命分子企图杀害治安员，也没有逮捕判刑。胡风分子在天津长期猖狂活动，我们只感到味道不对，但以为是文艺思想和个人作风问题，没有深究；对阿垅的历史虽有怀疑，但没有认真追查。这种右倾表现，显然会助长反革命的破坏活动，而对于人民是不利的。我们有一部分干部以为政权在我们手里，蒋介石匪帮都跑到台湾去了，几个残余漏网的反革命分子造不起反来，因而就麻痹大意，这是很不对的。根据天津市破获的案件，反革命分子通过各种关系把烈性炸药和毒药都送进来了准备炸毁我们重要的企业建筑和刺杀党、政干部。如果我们不提高警惕，我们一定会受到损害。因此，当前更主要的是要纠正右倾思想，对反革命分子实行坚定的镇压的方针。当然，我们对反革命分子的政策从来是镇压与宽大相结合的。党和政府从来没有说：对那些坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子也实行宽大，因为那就无异于破坏人民的利益；而对于那些罪恶不重，愿意悔过的分子如不给予改造的机会，同样也对于人民的事业不利。我们的宽大绝不是无原则的姑息，我们的镇压也不是凭主观感情用事。宽大与镇压都是完全为了人民的利益。
    在天津这样城市，厉行节约和镇压反革命是我们支援和保卫社会主义建设的主要环节。我们决心继续努力，深入地贯彻和经常地坚持这两个工作，为保证我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的完成而奋斗！
    杨思一代表的发言
    我完全同意中国共产党中央委员会所拟订的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理关于这个计划的报告和其他各个负责同志的报告。
    我们的五年计划是实施国家过渡时期总任务的重大步骤，是指引我们国家走向社会主义的具体道路，是全国人民共同利益也是最高利益的标帜，是中国各族人民后世子孙幸福生活的预示。这个计划的实现，要依靠中国共产党的坚强领导与全国六万万人民的铁的团结和努力。这个计划完成之后，将使我们的国家不仅政治上更为强大，在经济上也将逐步地强大起来。
    伟大的五年计划，很快就要为我们的大会所决定，现在摆在我们面前的最大任务是如何动员全国六万万人民全心全意地为实现这个计划所确定的方针与指标而努力。为了实现伟大的五年计划，既需要艰苦的工作，也需要顽强的斗争，一切企图破坏和平建设的行为必须粉碎，一切违反重点建设的方针，企图另找题目来转移目标或松懈人民群众经济建设意志的论调必须反对。
    五年计划中所规定的各部门基本建设投资的分配方案是国家重点建设方针的具体体现，也是与我国当前的具体情况相适应的；谁都没有忘记，近百年来帝国主义者所以敢于如此横蛮无理地侵略与压迫我国，一直到今天，还不恢复我国在联合国的合法权利、还敢于强占我国领土台湾，不是别的什么原因，而是我国工业太落后了的缘故；虽然在全国解放后短短五年多时间内，我国工业的发展已赶过了过去几十年，但我们并没有改变我国工业落后的面貌，也就是说，我国重工业尚不能解决自己制造汽车、拖拉机、飞机、坦克的要求；只有第一个五年计划，尤其是苏联替我国设计的一百五十六项重点项目全部建成后，我们才可以说我国已有了社会主义工业化的初步基础。由此可以看出，那种以为我们可以把更多的资金投入农业或其他方面的想法，是不妥当的，因此它必然会影响到国家重点建设方针的贯彻的。
    浙江基本上是农业生产为主的地区，李富春副总理报告中提到：“建设社会主义，必须解决小农经济同社会主义工业化之间的矛盾”，“克服农业的发展过分落后于工业发展的矛盾，是五年计划的一个重大任务”，“发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件”。这些指示，一方面使我们知道为了贯彻五年计划，我们应该干什么，另方面又深深地感觉自身责任的重大。
    浙江比起老解放区来是工作基础比较薄弱的新区，我们又缺乏国家建设特别是经济建设的经验，这在今后完成国家交给我们的艰巨任务中必然会带来不少困难。浙江省自解放以后，几年来在人民政府和党中央的正确领导下，基本上完成了国家交给的任务。如果我们在今后工作中少犯错误，能够勇敢地克服工作中可能产生的错误和缺点，那末我们就有可能更好地完成国家交给浙江省的任务。
    浙江省的自然条件很好，各方面的生产潜力很大。例如，全省现有二千六百多万亩土质优良的水田，有七千多万亩尚未完全开发的山区，有五千多平方浬的大渔场，有丝、茶、棉、麻、盐和有全国闻名的黄岩蜜橘、金华火腿、绍兴老酒等等。过去几年由于我们对全省的经济情况缺乏深入的了解，对全省的经济开发工作缺乏全面的规划与掌握，因此影响各项工作与农业生产尤其是某些经济作物的发展是不够快的。今后我们将根据五年计划所指出的方向与各种增产措施，结合浙江省的具体情况，在继续贯彻以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动的农村工作基本方针之下，树立既要搞好粮食生产，又要结合发展其他作物与副产，既要继续加强平原地区的工作与生产，又要积极开发山区经济与海上渔业生产的全面发展生产的观点。全省现有三万八千多个农业生产合作社，入社的农户占总农户的百分之十八点六，合作社的优越性已逐渐为广大农民所认识。参加互助组的农户占总农户的百分之六十左右，因此进一步合作化的条件是完全具备的。粮食生产每亩产量少则百余斤，多者千余斤，平均产量四百四十斤。这说明只要好好地把丰产区的经验总结起来，认真学习友邻地区的先进经验，在合作化的基础上，进一步的提高单位面积产量是大有希望的，至于扩大播种面积与适当增加耕地面积也是有可能的。根据上述情况，我们有把握完成国家所规定的各项指标。如果我们工作得更好一些，还可能超过它。当然在执行上述任务时，还会遇到各色各样的困难，但我们有决心去战胜它。
    这次会议是具有伟大历史意义的大会，这次会议精神的传达与贯彻，定会在全国人民中产生伟大的政治力量。但我们还必须注意，当我们高兴的时候，敌人正在那里切齿仇恨。为此我们必须时刻提高警惕，与一切敌人的阴谋破坏活动作斗争，让敌人在我们社会主义建设胜利面前发抖吧！
    荣毅仁代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护各位首长的报告。
    我听了李富春副总理的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，感到非常满意。这个计划的全部实现，将使我国国民经济发生重大的变化，这是一个把我国从落后的农业国家改变成为社会主义工业化国家的初步基础的计划，也即是使全国人民逐步走向美满幸福生活的计划。李富春副总理说：
  “五年内工业生产计划的完成，主要地依靠我国原有的企业。”我是一个从事于棉纺织业和面粉业的私营工商业者，以能够在这个计划中间贡献一分力量为光荣。我一定要在国营经济领导、工人群众监督之下，改进我所经营的企业的经营管理，厉行节约，反对浪费，生产“质量好、花样多、价钱巧”的产品来供应人民的需要；同时要把盈利所得，依法纳税，购买公债，投资内地，来支援建设；并要利用原有企业积极协助国家训练培养技术员工，以供建设需要；以这些行动来争取企业的公私合营，接受国家对企业和个人的社会主义改造。
    当我们全国人民都在努力工作，热忱地进行社会主义建设事业的时候，帝国主义者和蒋匪帮是不愿意的，它们不断地派遣特务来进行破坏活动，从报纸上揭露的材料就可以很清楚地看出来。我们工商业者，一般说来，对反革命分子的阴谋破坏都是非常痛恨，拥护政府对他们的惩处的，但是对如何来吸取教训，提高革命警惕性是不够的，有些是很不够的。有些人思想麻痹，以为一九五一年镇反运动之后，反革命分子已经肃清了，没有看到反革命分子仍有隐藏在国内，帝国主义者和蒋匪帮不断的派遣特务潜伏到大陆来。有些人漠不关心，以为粉碎高、饶反党联盟是共产党的事，清除胡风反革命集团是文艺界的事，肃清特务是公安、司法部门的事，没有看到反革命分子的活动，是会破坏我们国家的建设的，没有看到反革命分子会混入工商界中间隐蔽起来，会利用工商界的弱点来引诱，很可能使那些不愿意接受社会主义改造的工商业者蜕变成为反革命分子。因此，对反革命分子的麻痹大意，在客观上都是对反革命分子的纵容，对社会主义建设事业是不利的。
    从具体事例来看，反革命分子的活动是猖獗的。上海有一家造纸厂，反革命分子把电气方棚的螺丝放松，把二百匹的马达的轴令敲损了装在马达里，企图破坏该厂的动力，使生产停顿下来。有一家机器厂，反革命分子企图在食物内放“山奈”，这是一种最毒的化学品，来毒害职工。有一家电机厂，代某厂修理好了一部很重要的发电机装运出去，到安装起来的时候，发现里边放了螺丝、剪刀、油灰之类，企图破坏这架发电机。有一家纱厂，一个月内清花间起火二十多次，清花间如果烧了，这家厂就不能生产。幸而这些案件都能及时破案，避免了严重的损失。有一个同业公会九个干部中间混进了四个反革命分子，去年的十月十日他们还在庆祝所谓“双十节”。有一个企业，七个人中间六个是反革命分子。再从人的方面来看，例如上海市区工商联和同业公会的委员一级，从解放后到现在因反革命案被逮捕的共有二百六十一人，其中充任同业公会正副主任委员的就有六十三人；又工作人员被捕的有一百五十三人。这两类所占的比例，约为百分之五，这个比例是不小的。他们有的是反动官僚，有的是恶霸地主，有的是职业特务。他们有些人表面积极，背后搞阴谋诡计。总之，这些事实充分说明了反革命分子的危害性，破坏工厂，破坏生产，破坏治安，也就是破坏我们的建设，应该引起我们严重的警惕。我们一定要清醒头脑，来协助政府彻底肃清一切反革命分子。
    我们完全拥护常务委员会批准将反革命分子潘汉年、胡风逮捕审判的决定。我们作为一个工商业者和民主党派的成员，就必须说老实话，做老实事，有意见要提，有错误就改，任用人员时要破除情面，仔细审查，认真学习政策，对不了解政策的人进行宣传解释，相互帮助，我们积极的接受改造，走社会主义建设的路，不让反革命分子利用我们的弱点来钻空子；同时，对谣言必须追究来源，有事故要查清底细，揭发和检举坏分子，不让反革命分子蒙混隐蔽在我们队伍中间。为了全部实现我国的第一个五年计划，保卫我们革命胜利的果实，让我们更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，不让一个漏网。
    蒋光鼐部长的发言
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的报告及李先念副总理关于财政预、决算的报告，完全同意彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    第一个五年计划草案规定优先发展重工业的方针，是完全正确的。从纺织工业方面来看，也是一样的，只有重工业发展了，纺织工业的新型的设备才有来源，纺织工业的技术才能得到不断的改进。同时，因为纺织工业的原料，都需要依靠农业生产来供应。而发展农业生产，满足纺织工业原料的需要，没有重工业供应大量的农业机器及大量的化学肥料，也是办不到的。至于纺织工业所必需的染料及人造纤维、合成纤维的发展，如果没有基本化学工业的发展，也是有困难的。因此，优先发展重工业，正是为农业和轻工业的发展开辟广泛的道路。
    我国纺织工业在过去五年内已经得到了很快的发展。但由于人民生活的提高，纺织工业品还不能充分满足人民的需要。因此，在五年建设计划中，对纺织工业的发展曾经设想过较高的指标。后来经过反复研究平衡，感到缺乏可靠的基础，基本原因是原料供应不足，所以把原来较高的指标适当压缩，使之既照顾到人民生活的需要，又照顾到原料供应的可能，并符合国家优先发展重工业的政策。如指标定的过低，也会影响人民的生活。这就说明纺织工业发展的速度，应该全面地考虑。不然，就容易发生偏向。因而，我认为五年计划为纺织工业所规定的发展速度是适当的。
    为了克服纺织工业原料不足的困难，除农业上应尽可能增加产量以外，我们纺织工业部门的责任也是重大的。这就是一方面要尽量节约原料，一方面要多想办法开辟新的资源，主要是应该研究利用各种可以利用的纤维，研究各种可以代用的原料。过去我们曾经研究利用棉杆皮及香蕉茎皮织制麻袋，研究苎麻和棉花混纺，丝、毛交织等，虽已获得了一些成就，但这些工作还仅仅是开始，而且技术上还存在一些问题，还需要我们以后作更大的努力。
    我们完全同意有些代表提出的建议，今后应该积极发展人造纤维及合成纤维工业，第一个五年计划中，已计划新建设一个年产一万吨近代化的人造纤维工厂，并准备恢复安乐及安东人造纤维厂，为今后人造纤维工业的发展打下基础。目前发展人造纤维工业的主要问题，除了技术条件不够以外，原料供应上也不是没有问题的。因为我们过去研究成功可作人造纤维原料的只有木浆，而木浆需要针叶松作原料，这种木材在我国亦不是很充足的。因此，要发展人造纤维工业，也必须积极设法开辟新的原料资源。现在除下脚棉及棉籽绒试验已经成功外，我们正继续以竹浆、甘蔗渣及其他纤维进行试验。如果这些试验能够获得成功，而经济效果又高，就可为我国今后发展人造纤维工业创造更好的条件。至于合成纤维工业，在重工业逐步发展的过程中，经过各方面努力，我想也是能够获得一定的成就的。
    为了要集中力量发展重工业，我们纺织工业在完成五年计划中，除了应该完成自己的计划以适当满足人民对纺织品方面日益增长的需要以外，还有为国家积累资金的重大任务。因此，我们必须大力反对浪费，建立严格的节约制度。现在，在我们纺织工业部门中，浪费的现象还是相当严重的，如果我们不能克服浪费现象，发掘各方面的潜力为国家积累资金，对于国家完成五年计划也是有影响的。
    纺织工业部门的浪费，表现在基本建设方面正如李富春副总理所指出的首先是：对于生产性的建设和非生产性的建设没有很好加以区别。对生产性的建设要求达到一定的现代化的标准是必要的，当然也应切合实际，不能离开现实条件过远。但我们有许多同志对非生产性的建设也盲目追求所谓“社会主义标准”，什么都要大、要新、要多、要好、要全，宿舍、食堂、托儿所、子弟学校等都要求很高，这就是不对的。在过去我们新建的几个工厂中，生活设施的标准是高的，浪费也是大的。其次，在建筑施工管理方面也存在不少缺点。如对建设项目研究不够，缺乏正确的定额和标准，计划编得不切合实际，对材料保管及劳动力管理注意不够。因此便使应该节约的也不能进行节约了。再其次，就是我们对各筹建单位筹建费用，没有规定明确的项目和一定的标准，也没有进行严格的控制，因而各筹建单位对筹建费的使用，也就不受限制。我们曾在新厂投资中列了一项绿化费，其目的主要是在工厂周围栽种一些树木，以避免风沙。但有些单位却派人到处去买名贵花木。有的单位用筹建费来建筑喷水池，甚至把水池内的金鱼也列入基建投资内。有的筹建单位一成立，就要买汽车、买沙发、买收音机、买地毯，而且都要漂亮的。有的工厂还嫌自己做的一百六十元的沙发不好，派人到天津去买皮沙发。另外也还有些筹建单位，盲目采购东西，不管自己现在能否用得上。如只有二十个理发员，就买了一百零四把推子和发剪，买了一百二十八把刀子，有人说可以用四十年。这些都说明我们不少同志既不了解为国家节约资金的意义，也不了解国家进行建设仍需要继续发扬过去艰苦奋斗的优良传统。也有不少的同志的确已经滋长了奢侈思想，习染了铺张的风气，忘记了过去的艰苦朴素的作风。这是十分危险的，应该引起我们的警惕。最近我们根据厉行全面节约的精神，经过重新研究，用核减或推迟可以缓建的项目，降低建筑标准和造价，适当减少可能减少的宿舍和某些福利设施，减少基本建设预备费和备料费等办法，可以为第一个五年计划后三年的投资节省九千万元。可见在纺织工业基本建设方面的节约潜在力是很大的。我们应该继续不断地挖掘这种潜在力。
    纺织工业部门在生产方面的浪费也同样存在的。首先是产品的质量不好。棉纱棉结杂质多，棉布布面黑白点多，染整布颜色不坚牢，缩水率大，印花布花色不鲜艳，图案单调。产生这些缺点的原因，除原料好坏有一定的影响外，主要是在技术管理工作上还存在着不少缺点。必须认识，质量不好，影响使用时间，这种浪费是难以计算的。其次是对节约原料不论棉、毛、麻、丝纺织企业都注意的不够，以棉纺织来说，全国各种不同经济类型的棉纺织厂原棉消耗量悬殊很大。公私合营厂一般比国营厂高，私营厂更高。就以国营厂来说，去年全国平均每件纱（混合件）用棉量是三百八十八点七二斤，但最高的却达到三百九十九点九二斤，较平均用棉量要高一十一点二斤。如果用棉量较多的厂，都能赶上用棉量少的厂，我们就能节约更多的棉花。此外，材料消耗和煤、电消耗，也都有很大的节约潜在力。再其次，就是我们在劳动力使用及企业管理费、车间经费各方面的节约潜力也是很大的。目前我们的企业一般都缺乏严格的定员，非生产人员过多。企业管理费和车间经费各企业间高低也很悬殊，如以设备基本相同的企业比较，今年第一季度上海国棉十五厂比天津国棉四厂高百分之六十八点七一。如以同一地区设备相同的企业作比较，第一季度青岛国棉七厂比国棉三厂高百分之四十九点六二。在这方面，如果管理费用大的企业均能做到和开支少的企业一样，就能节约更多的资金。
    为了在生产企业厉行节约，反对浪费，必须在所有企业管理人员中树立经济核算思想和精打细算的作风。企业的经济核算制必须逐步予以加强。最近我们初步计算了一下，如果今年原料能按计划供应，生产计划不再变更，国营纺织企业（包括供销系统）即可在财务成本方面节约二千万元左右，在流动资金方面节省四千万元左右。如果我们各个企业都能在各方面精打细算，努力节约，节约的数字
  一定会比这些数字更大。
    在我们纺织工业系统中，有不少人强调要节约原料就一定会影响产品质量。当然，原料和质量不是完全没有关系的。但是把节约原料与保证质量绝对对立起来的看法，是十分错误的。我们所说的节约用棉，主要是在保证质量的基础上，要求每个企业对棉花的有效纤维，一点也不浪费，并不是应该去的杂质也不去掉，更不是要在原料上投机取巧，甚至偷工减料，造成更大的浪费。我们所说的保证产品质量，主要是要加强技术领导，加强企业管理，合理的使用原料。实际，如果不加强技术领导，不加强企业管理，即使多消耗了原料，产品的质量也是不能保证的。
    纺织工业部门在基本建设及生产方面所以存在严重的缺点，首先是由于我们领导上检查不严，督促不力，缺乏应有的严格的制度或制度不完善，特别是思想工作和政治工作作得不够。在纺织工业干部中相当普遍地存在着骄傲自满情绪，满足于已有的成绩，不虚心向别人学习，缺乏批评与自我批评的精神。这种骄傲自满情绪，如不能得到克服，各种工作都是无法作好的。因此，为了能胜利地完成五年计划，我们纺织工业部门所有干部，都必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，充分发挥批评与自我批评的精神，以便能随时改正自己的缺点，把我们的工作提高一步。
    赛福鼎副委员长的发言
    ——各民族更加亲密地团结起来，为胜利地完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗！
    我完全同意中国共产党中央委员会主持拟定的中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理兼国家计划委员会主任关于这个计划的报告，并提议大会通过这个五年计划草案和报告。同时，我完全同意李先念副总理兼财政部长关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，完全同意彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，并提议大会通过这个决算预算报告、兵役法草案和报告。
    在中国共产党中央委员会和毛主席的直接领导下编制完成而提出的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是具有重大历史意义的，因为它是实现我国过渡时期的总任务，把我国由落后的农业国逐步变成先进的社会主义工业国的正确的纲领和重要的步骤。这样的计划，是在我国人民过去的生活中从来没有过而且也不可能有的。按照我国第一个五年计划，在发展国民经济的进程中，将取得较恢复时期更大的成就。五年内，国民经济和文化教育事业的支出总数共七百六十六亿四千万元。工业总产值
  一九五二年为二百七十亿零一千万元，到一九五七年将达到五百三十五亿六千万元（即增加百分之九十八点三）；农业总产值（包括副业产值）一九五二年为四百八十三亿九千万元，到一九五七年将达到五百九十六亿六千万元（即增加百分之二十三点三）。在发展生产的基础上，全国人民包括各少数民族人民的物质生活和文化生活水平将有一定程度的提高，并为他们建立日益富裕幸福的生活打下良好的基础。
    全国各少数民族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，都以中华人民共和国的有权力的成员的身份过着生活。为全国各少数民族享有的各个方面的平等权利，已经在去年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的宪法上以法律形式固定起来了。现在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正在讨论和将要通过的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，它的每一章节的规定和每一项经济、文化教育事业的建设，都是全国各民族人民共同的利益。不仅如此，而且在第一个五年计划里，特别强调了关于少数民族地区交通运输、贸易、财政、文化教育、卫生事业和培养干部等方面的工作，充分地证明了第一个五年计划特别重视少数民族的利益。为这些，各族人民感到莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。同时，我们坚决相信在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在伟大的汉族人民的帮助下，我们各少数民族一定能够逐步过渡到社会主义社会和获得无限发展的前途。
    解放以后，全国各少数民族人民在中共中央和毛主席的领导下，在中央人民政府的关怀下，不同程度的都获得许多新的成就，打下了逐步发展国民经济的一些基础。拿我们处在祖国西北边疆的多民族的新疆来说吧，新疆地区在过去几年内，进行了镇压反革命、改革土地制度、“三反”“五反”等运动，大力培养了少数民族干部。从一九五○年至一九五二年底，恢复和发展了农业和畜牧业生产，并且开始建立了若干现代化工业（解放前，可以说新疆没有什么现代化工业）。具体事实是这样的：一九五二年的工农业总产值已达到六亿八千四百二十四万一千四百元（按新币计算，下同），其中工业总产值为三千九百零七万五千四百元（占百分之五点七一）；农业总产值为四亿零三百四十六万九千五百元（占百分之五十八点九七）；畜牧业总产值为一亿零六百零九万七千六百元（占百分之十五点五一）；手工业总产值为一亿三千五百五十九万八千九百元（占百分之十九点八一）。文化教育事业也有发展，一九五二年有高等学校一个，学生达一千零七十五名；中等专业学校一所，学生达五百五十七名；中学四十所，学生达一万四千三百十七名；小学一千八百所，学生达三十三万一千八百七十名。这些成就，为新疆地区执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划创造了有利条件。
    根据国家第一个五年计划草案和新疆地区恢复和发展国民经济的情况，我们执行第一个五年计划的任务，是以大力发展农业和畜牧业生产为中心，同时，整顿、提高现有工矿企业，举办地方供、产、销能够平衡的新的工业，发展交通运输、邮电事业，有步骤地发展国营商业和合作社商业，扩大城乡物资交流，发展对苏联的贸易，对个体农业、手工业和私营工商业逐步实行社会主义改造，保证社会主义经济在全部国民经济中的比重逐年增长，以适当地满足各族人民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要。
    新疆第一个五年计划所要达到的指标是：一九五七年工农业总产值十二亿九千三百二十二万七千二百元（较一九五二年增加百分之八十九），其中工业总产值占二亿九千二百七十五万八千五百元（较一九五二年增加百分之六百四十九）；农业总产值占五亿八千七百十九万五千二百元（较一九五二年增加百分之四十五点五）；畜牧业总产值占二亿零七百七十万元（较一九五二年增加百分之九十五点七）；手工业总产值占二亿零五百五十七万三千五百元（较一九五二年增加百分之五十一点六）。其中农业发展的计划是这样的：一九五七年粮食总产量达到四十三亿四千九百四十万一千斤，较一九五二年增加百分之三十五点七七；棉花总产量达到一亿零五百九十二万斤，较一九五二年增加百分之三百三十六；油料作物总产量达到一亿七千一百万斤，增加百分之十五点零五。到一九五七年组织起来的农户将达到七十六万户，占全部农户的百分之八十五；农业生产合作社将发展到八千个，农场将达到三百二十处，并将成立拖拉机站十处。一九五七年各种牲畜将达到二千三百十二万四千头，较一九五二年增加百分之六十七点三七。
    五年内，文化教育与卫生事业发展计划是这样的：到一九五七年高等学校的学生达到两千零五十人；中等专业学校三所，学生达到三千四百四十一人；师范学校八所，学生达到三千二百人；中学六十六所，学生达到四万一千五百五十五人；小学二千一百九十八所，学生达到四十二万八千一百八十人。此外，有新疆农学院一所。一九五七年完成新疆医学院的基本建设，并开始工作。医院九十八所，病床二千六百十五张；疗养院四所，病床一百九十张；妇幼保健所九所，病床五十张。电影放映队九十九队，电影院二十六个。文化馆六十四个，图书馆二个，博物馆一个。出版报纸十一种，两千二百二十一万份；杂志五种，四十五万五千册；图书三百五十种，二百八十五万册。
    以上是我国少数民族地区之一——新疆在国民经济恢复时期中所已达到的成就和在第一个五年计划国民经济发展时期中将要达到的指标。很显然，这些已经达到的成就和将要达到的指标，已经很大地改变了和必将更大地改变新疆的面貌，已经很大地改变了和必将更大地改善新疆各族人民的经济和文化生活。正因为如此，我代表新疆各族人民向中共中央、毛主席和中央人民政府致以衷心的感谢。
    但是，这并不意味新疆的工作中没有缺点和错误，我们工作上在取得具有重大历史性成就的同时是有缺点和某些错误的，特别是在基本建设、生产、财政、贸易和商业部门中存在的缺点和错误还较为严重和突出。但是，这些工作中的缺点和错误，有的及时地得到了纠正，有的正在纠正。
    为了祖国建设事业的发展，为了新疆各民族经济、文化事业的发展，新疆各民族人民都迫切希望铁路很快地通到新疆，迫切希望这一比其它任何一条都近的国际铁路线把我们的首都北京同伟大的莫斯科联结起来。在这里，新疆各族人民的这个愿望，我向全国人民代表大会这次会议再叙述一遍。我们也知道，问题不仅在于希望兰新铁路很快修通，而重要的，是在于作好迎接兰新铁路修通的一切准备工作。这些准备工作就是创造兰新铁路修通以后在新疆开始大规模经济建设所需要的条件。我们必须大力勘察荒地，兴修水利，扩大耕地面积；加强以互助合作为中心的农业增产工作，增产粮食和各种经济作物，特别是棉花；发展畜牧业，增加畜产品；加紧地质勘察工作，查明地下资源；大量培养干部等。做好这些工作，对于兰新铁路修通以后新疆进行大规模经济建设具有重大意义。我们坚决相信，在中共中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在汉族人民和中国人民解放军驻新疆生产部队的帮助下，在新疆各族人民的努力下，我们一定能够作好为迎接兰新铁路修通而要作的以上的各项工作。
    在新疆地区为了保证上述任务的胜利完成，必须采取各种措施，其中一个，就是要继续镇压反革命。新疆地区和全国各地一样，反革命分子的各种破坏活动日益嚣张，他们制造谣言，挑拨离间，破坏民族团结，破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，在国家的各种生产部门里进行着破坏生产，破坏机器，纵火，暗害负责人员和工人，甚至组织反革命暴乱。这些罪恶活动，引起了各族人民极大的愤恨。在今年六月间举行的省协商委员会常务委员会扩大会议一致提出了要镇压反革命的建议，我们到各地视察工作时，许多人又提出了同样的建议。为了保证发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的胜利完成，为了保护各族人民的利益，必须根据宪法的规定和广大人民的要求，给人民的敌人以严重的打击，扫除反革命分子，扫除在我们社会主义革命前进道路上的一切障碍。
    此外，我们完全拥护此次会议关于厉行节约，反对浪费的伟大号召和决定，并在新疆地区坚决贯彻执行，以加速资金的积累和社会主义建设事业的发展。
    我们全国人民在党和人民政府的领导下，正在以最大的努力胜利地前进着。我国各族人民，一心一意地日益坚强地团结在中华人民共和国的大家庭里。事实证明：我们各族人民的团结一致，是我们各族人民真诚愿望的反映。在我们各族人民面前摆着新的伟大的任务，需要我们努力地去完成。我们必须更加巩固工农联盟，并在这个联盟的基础上，更加巩固各族人民的团结，为胜利地完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    彭泽民代表的发言
    从一九五三年起，我们全国人民，就在中国共产党的领导下，开始实行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，到现在已经二年多了。在这次会议上，我们看到了这个经过长期间的慎重研究和精心拟订的第一个五年计划。这个内容丰富、擘划周详、规模宏远而又十分切合中国实际情况的经济建设计划，就是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的具有决定意义的纲领。这个计划表达出中国人民的共同愿望，反映了中国人民整体的最高利益和长远利益。我们从这个计划中看到祖国的伟大，并为此而感到自豪，更为这个伟大计划的提出而得到莫大的鼓舞。我衷心拥护这个计划，并拥护李富春副总理代表国务院所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，提议大会一致通过这个计划。同时，我并同意李先念副总理所作的关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告；拥护彭德怀副总理所作的关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理所作的关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告和彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并建议大会一致通过。
    我现在就第一个五年计划和农业生产有关的问题讲几句话。我国的农业生产，解放后通过土改已经逐步改进，但还存在许多困难，主要是落后的小农经济尚未改变，经常受到自然灾害威胁。最近我曾回过我的故乡广东视察，适逢全省大旱。从这次灾情和抗旱情况看来，使我深深感到第一个五年计划中关于农业改造和发展计划的正确和重要。为了说明一些问题，仅将我这次所看到的广东抗旱情形，作简单的报告。
    广东八个多月没有下过大雨，旱情为数十年来所未有。许多池塘干涸，河溪断流，田土干裂达一尺多深，严重影响广东的农业生产。为了完成今年的农业生产计划，全省农民在共产党和人民政府的坚强领导下，长期地艰苦地进行了抗旱斗争。他们封江堵河，打井开沟，不惜任何艰难险阻，日夜不休地忘我劳动。抗旱中农民用移植和干插办法去保全秧苗，干插时农民往往擦破指头，也毫不顾惜。各地普遍打井，光是粤西区全区农民就打井十万零四千一百眼。工程最大的是拦河筑坝，引水灌田；拿我家乡所在地的粤中区来说，就有堵塞北江主流和拦截绥江两宗大工程，在堵塞北江主流时曾筑起长达五百余公尺的主坝和二百余公尺的副坝，把从来被人认为难以制服的水拦住，要它顺着人民的意志流到附近干旱的农田上去。像这样的巨大工程，各地都普遍进行。在抗旱的最后阶段，中共广东省委员会和广东省人民委员会动员工人、人民解放军、机关干部、青年学生等数万人下乡支援农民抗旱，省市各机关和湖北省都调抽水机前往支援，更加鼓舞了农民的抗旱情绪。
    由于共产党和人民政府的坚强领导，坚持抗旱，终于接上立夏后二日的连续大雨，这时，下乡支援农民的工人、军队、干部、学生即全力帮助农民抢插，群众互相调剂劳力和畜力。工作时他们带着饭菜至田间饮食，虽一饭的时间，也不肯放过。这些都充分地表现了农民高度的劳动热情。经过一场紧张的战斗之后，终于取得抗旱工作的伟大胜利。各位代表，我报告一个好消息，我们广东经过大旱的地区现在都开始收割了，成绩还算好的。
    在这次抗旱中，农民深深感到过去水利不修，一遇天不下雨，就闹旱灾的痛苦，解放后人民政府逐步改善了农田水利。但在抗旱工作进行中，农民仍感到抽水机不足，感到用旧式水车汲水的效果不大。有的农民说：“抽水机比我们打井好得多，汲水量大得多，可惜太少了。”总路线下乡和抗旱的经验，深刻地教育了农民，使他们感到一家一户各自在小块的土地上经营，是不可能抵御自然灾害的。农业生产合作社在抗旱中所起的带头作用和它所显示出来的优越性，使农民更加有走向集体化的要求，和有用机器来耕种田地的进一步的要求。我这次回去，一位八十多岁的老太婆向我讲述她家里的生产和生活情况，非常高兴，她口口声声感谢毛主席。她说：“土改后我分到了田地和耕牛（两家人同一头牛），我的一个好吃懒做的儿子，在共产党和人民政府的教育下也变成了勤劳节俭的好农民了。”我问她现在还希望什么？她回答：“如果有拖拉机来种田，那就更好了。”这位老婆婆真是说出了广大农民的心愿。我们的五年计划，就是要逐步满足农民这些要求的。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经取得了革命的伟大胜利，我们的第一个五年计划通过后，六亿的中国人民一定能够继续在中国共产党的领导下，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，为完成和争取超额完成这个计划而奋斗。
    然而，国内外敌人是不会甘心于他们的失败的。在我们进行伟大的经济建设的过程中，美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子一定会从各方面来破坏我们，我们必须百倍提高警惕，防止和肃清一切反革命分子的破坏活动，以保证社会主义的胜利。
    最后，我还要向国外华侨表达我个人的一点希望，多少年来，国外的华侨都希望祖国繁荣和富强。现在我们制定的第一个五年计划和所确定各项政策，正是符合了广大华侨的共同愿望。我希望爱国的侨胞更进一步团结起来，积极参加祖国的建设事业，为建设伟大的社会主义祖国而贡献自己的一切力量。
    罗隆基代表的发言
    我完全赞成国务院向大会提出的：发展国民经济的第一个五年计划；一九五四年决算和一九五五年预算；中华人民共和国兵役法；关于根除黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划。我同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理分别对上列各项法案所作的报告。我同意彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    今天我愿意特别指出，现在本会正在讨论的第
  一个五年计划，它不是中国一个国家私自的事情，是有重要的国际意义的一件大事。我们的第一个五年计划是中国人民的和平建设事业，是中国人民要在世界和平环境中建设新国家的事业，同时，这也是中国六万万人民为着保卫祖国，为着保卫亚洲和世界和平的建设事业。
    在赫尔辛基参加世界和平大会的时候，我已经明显地看出了，两年多来中国人民在国家经济恢复的基础上进行第一个五年计划的光辉成绩，已经在国际上起了重大的作用，得到了良好的反应。
    中国代表团在这次世界和平大会中，关心的是整个世界和平的全盘问题。同时，世界和平大会也认识到有关中国的问题在世界和平事业上的重要性，因此，在最后的决议明确地指出：“按照联合国宪章的规定，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利，联合国才可以实现它的宗旨。”世界和平大会的综合决议庄严地向全世界宣告：“台湾不可辩驳地是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，外国军队应该从台湾撤退，台湾应该归还中国。”
    这说明什么呢？这说明世界和平大会的代表们都知道，新中国正在进行的和平建设事业是对世界和平有利的，中国人民的和平建设事业是为世界和平服务的，中国人民的和平建设事业是世界爱好和平人民的共同事业。世界和平人民都明确地看出了这样几个事实：
    中国的经济建设是社会主义性质的建设。社会主义建设事业的目的是继续不断地提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水准。这就根本不同于资本主义国家的工业，私人资本家为着争取超额利润，要掠夺落后国家的资源，要侵占落后国家的领土，要用战争来扩大殖民地。
    中国的和平建设事业是要在和平环境中进行的建设事业，这就充分地证明了中国人“要和平不要战争”的诚意。我们治理淮河黄河，是要根治水灾旱灾，当然不是利用淮河黄河来训练海军。我们开垦荒地荒山，是要扩大农业作物，培植森林，绝对不是利用几百万方里的荒地荒山来试验原子弹氢气弹。中国没有军火垄断资本家，就没有人要制造国际紧张局势，发动世界战争来推销工厂中的机关枪、坦克车、飞机、大炮。
    中国和平建设事业的成功将鼓励一切落后国家努力发展自己的新工业，建设繁荣幸福的新国家。倘一切落后国家在经济上都能够独立自主，世界各国就真能在平等的基础上互助合作，和平共处。新中国对邻邦友邦的经济交流，技术互助，根本不同于美帝国主义用“美援”的招牌，破坏别国的主权，侵占别国的领土，普遍建立军事基地，积极准备世界战争。
    中国经济建设的成功必然会增强中国的国防力量，同时也必然会增强以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营的力量。全世界人民都知道，今天国际局势的渐趋和缓，四大国日内瓦会议得以召开，并且会议能够得到初步的圆满结果，主要的原因是苏联、中国和世界各人民民主国家经济建设事业的成功和一贯坚持的和平政策的影响。
    诸位代表，我们必须明白，在今天的国际局势中，爱好和平人民所欢迎的、所爱护的建设事业，就必定是和平的敌人所反对、所惧怕、所妒嫉的事业，对这样的和平建设事业，他们必定要造谣诽谤，阴谋破坏。
    资本主义国家的报纸不是正在用讥讽嘲笑的口吻来估计我们工业建设的前途吗？他们用恶意的愿望当成可能的现实，他们断定中国的工业发展将永远赶不上英美，因而他们聊以自慰地说：“到了公元二千年的时候，英德工业的进步不会仍旧留在现在的水准上面，当然更不用说美国了！”
    他们想用这样恶意的宣传，来抹煞社会主义和资本主义两种制度本质的不同，来掩盖两种制度生产发展速度上的巨大差别。但是事实是抹煞不了的，事实是掩盖不了的。让我们看看具体的事实是怎样吧！一九二九年到一九五一年在这二十多年的时期中，英国工业只增加了百分之六十，美国尽管利用工业军事化的方法提高生产，美国的工业生产在这个时期中只增加了一倍，而苏联工业在这个时期中增加了十二倍。社会主义苏联的工业每年平均发展速度超过了美国速度十倍以上。欧洲六个人民民主国家（波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚）在一九五二年的工业生产，增加了百分之二十，西欧六个资本主义国家（法、比、奥、荷、希腊、卢森堡）只增加了百分之零点八。换句话说，人民民主国家工业增加速度同西欧六个资本主义国家比较要大到二十五倍。就拿我们的第一个五年计划来说吧，五年内，国营工业的劳动生产率提高百分之六四，平均每年约提高百分之一○。并且必须指出，腐朽的垂死的资本主义的生产速度，今天正在由停滞而日趋下降。事实胜于雄辩。这些铁一般的事实就充分地证实了列宁这样的一个预言：“资本主义可以被彻底战胜，是因为社会主义能够造成新的更高得多的劳动生产率！”
    到了公元二千年的时候，美国、英国工业发展的程度到底怎样，历史规律的发展会作出结论的。对这样一个问题，我相信美国英国的人民终久会明白，而且也是应该早早明白的。在今天，谁亦不愿，并且谁亦不敢，为一个腐朽的垂死的资本主义制度做五十年的寿命保险！
    社会主义制度国家的主张很明显，世界不同制度的国家和平共处，和平竞赛。我们政治制度的优越性，早已超过资本主义的先进国，我们已经远远地跑在美国英国的前面。在经济方面，在和平竞赛中，中国人民有充分的信心，有绝对的把握，赶上并且超过所谓的资本主义先进国。
    在这次四大国日内瓦会议中，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁已经依据和平共处的五大原则，对艾森豪威尔总统、艾登首相、富尔总理提出了许多和平解决欧洲以及整个世界问题的具体建议，这正是对美、英、法三国首脑人物一个真实的考验。我们拥护苏联这些建议。中国周恩来总理同印度尼赫鲁总理、缅甸吴努总理和印度尼西亚沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理先后发表的关于和平共处原则的联合声明，说明中国人民和政府欢迎用和平协商方式，解决国际上一切问题，包括远东问题在内，以达到和平共处，和平竞赛的目的！
    诸位代表，四大国日内瓦会议虽然在良好气氛中结束，但欧洲安全和德国问题、裁军问题以及发展东西方的接触问题尚待解决。远东国际形势由于美帝国主义的操纵指使，今天仍然日趋紧张。在这样的国际形势中，我们全国人民代表大会的代表有必要，同时亦有责任，再一次地向世界声明：为了保卫祖国和平建设事业的安全，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，中国人民一定要解放台湾，中国人民一致拥护周恩来总理处理台湾问题的英明政策：“中国人民解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。”中国人民在解放战争中就有过许多和平解放的先例。不过解放台湾完全是中国的内政问题，中国人民完全有权利选择自己的解决内政问题的方法和方式。中国人民在行使主权的行动上，有权利用自己的各种力量来完成祖国完全统一的任务，来保卫祖国的领土完整。中国人民有信心有力量取得解放台湾的胜利！倘美帝国主义不撤退侵占台湾的武装力量，并且继续用武装力量干涉中国的内政，一切后果应由美国政府自己负责。
    诸位代表，我们第一个五年计划的重要任务之一，就是及时地准备技术上经济上的必要条件来最高限度地提高国防力量，以打击敌人对中国武装干涉武装侵犯的阴谋。列宁在鼓励苏联人民从事重工业建设的时候，就这样说过：“战争是铁面无私的，它用毫不容情的方式提出问题：或是灭亡，或是在经济方面赶上并且超过先进国家。”在今天，这仍然是中国人民的好教训！
    诸位代表，让我们这次大会全体一致地通过发展国民经济的第一个五年计划！
    让我们号召全中国六万万人民，在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，全心全力，努力增产，厉行节约，克服一切艰苦困难，胜利地完成第一个五年计划！
    让我们牢牢地记住毛泽东主席对全国人民的指示和鼓励：
    “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。”
  华尔功成烈代表的
    发言
    我完全同意和拥护“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案”和李富春副总理代表国务院所作的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。我也同意会议上的其他几个报告。建设祖国的美丽的图样已摆在我们眼前，它给我们的今后工作增加了百倍的力量。我们是感到多么的兴奋。
    第一个五年计划草案绪言中指示：“在工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党领导下的工农联盟是我国获得伟大人民革命胜利、建立人民民主专政的基础，是我国继续取得社会主义胜利的基础。为着运用和加强人民民主专政的国家权力来有计划地发展和改造国民经济，建设社会主义社会，就必须不断地巩固工农联盟，巩固以工农联盟为基础的全国各民族的人民民主统一战线。”从几年来四川省藏族自治区的工作实践中，证明这个指示是完全正确的。解放后，我区各族人民紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，经过剿匪、团结建设、大力培养民族干部、发展生产，我区已经出现了一种欣欣向荣的气象。现在我们应更加巩固民族团结，开展各项工作。在这次五年计划草案的讨论中，我自己更加深刻地体会到：各少数民族地区的经济和文化事业的发展，人民生活的提高，也必须在五年计划总的精神下，根据不同地区的不同条件，照顾到可能和需要两个方面，来有步骤地有准备地前进。为了有力地支援国家社会主义经济建设，进一步巩固民族团结，改善各族人民生活，根据五年计划规定和稻区实行情况，我区首先应该大力发展农牧业生产。扶助农民改良农具，改进耕作方法，扩大耕地面积，逐步达到粮食自足，在国家必须与可能的条件下派遣农业技术人员前来我区勘察草原，筹建农场。我区草原宽广，地势平坦，人口稀少，具有大量发展农牧业生产的优越条件。我相信在中国共产党的正确领导下，一定能够完成和超额完成农牧业生产任务。但是，国民党残余匪特企图不让我们走这幸福的道路，他们想尽一切办法来破坏我们的建设。虽然解放以后我区通过军事剿匪，消灭了马良、傅炳勋等股匪，匪特已基本肃清，特别是一九五四年自治区人民代表会议上通过了团结剿匪公约以后，社会治安有了显著改善，但迄今以来，在我工作薄弱的几省交界地区，仍有少数漏网的匪特在从事造谣破坏活动，抢劫国家与人民财产，暗杀我政府工作人员，挑拨民族间和民族内部的团结。此外，还有一些外来不法地主及与本地暗藏的反革命分子互相勾结起来，也在破坏生产，破坏社会治安，使各族人民生命财产受到极大的威胁，今年内仅烧毁森林事件即发生数十起。为了顺利开展各项工作、保障各族人民生命财产的安全，根据宪法和惩治反革命条例的规定，彻底肃清匪特，严惩反革命分子，是我区当前刻不容缓的重要任务。必须进一步加强各族团结，加强治安工作，发动各族人民制定公约，教育各族人民对敌人绝不能有丝毫的麻痹大意，特别是与人民有联系的领袖人物要负担起维护治安的责任。对敌人不能片面地讲宽大，对敌人片面宽大，人民就要遭殃。在五年建设计划当中，我们应更加警惕敌人的阴谋破坏。另外，我们建议在几省交界的地区，有关的省在清匪肃特问题上，应该统一领导，统一步调，不给匪特活动留下任何空隙。
    各位代表：只有以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的、我们人民自己的中华人民共和国的成立，只有国家的经济命脉为人民自己掌握的时候，我国才有可能有计划地发展国民经济和进行社会主义的建设和社会主义的改造，同时也只有这样才能使我国由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国。但是我们的国家曾经是一个长期被帝国主义统治的半殖民地、殖民地和半封建的国家，经济是异常落后的，因此在进行大规模的经济建设中是有很多的困难的。但我们有了中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，有伟大的苏联人民无私的帮助，有全国各族人民钢铁般的团结和艰苦奋斗，我们就一定能战胜困难，完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的伟大任务。
    黄绍竑代表的发言
    我完全同意国务院李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理和彭真副委员长所作的报告，我热烈拥护中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并坚决为实现五年计划而奋斗。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我国国民经济遵循着共同纲领的经济政策，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，进行有计划的恢复和建设，在一九五二年底就结束了国民经济的恢复阶段，并为发展国民经济第一个五年计划准备了有利条件，现在已经进入五年计划的第三年度，这就充分证明在共产党和毛主席的领导之下，在苏联的无私的兄弟般的援助之下，在工人、农民和各民族、各民主党派的团结努力之下，我国国民经济的恢复和建设，不但没有浪费时间，也没有走过弯路，成绩是辉煌的，是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。
    一九五四年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议庄严地通过了中华人民共和国宪法，一九五五年第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议国务院就及时地提出了中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和国家的决算预算、中华人民共和国兵役法、根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，这就充分表现出我人民政府对于实践宪法的高度精神和实现宪法的最基本的步骤。
    我国的宪法是社会主义类型的宪法，宪法序言说：“中华人民共和国的人民民主制度，也就是新民主主义制度，保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”又说
  “从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义社会建成，这是一个过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”我倾听了李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理的报告，我阅读了有关的文件，我觉得它是完全符合于宪法的精神和规定的。五年计划和兵役法以及治黄规划，把整个宪法中经济的、国防的重大意义和规定具体化起来，有计划地付诸实现。这是符合于全国人民的利益和愿望的，它将获得全体代表和全国人民的拥护和支持，是毫无疑问的。
    厉行节约反对浪费是保证五年计划完成的重要环节，在有关文件中都强调了这一点，而两位李副总理对于过去浪费现象都作了严肃而深刻的批评，是十分必要的。在李先念副总理报告中说到贪污盗窃现象近来有一些滋长，据不完全统计，贪污的人数共达四千三百余人，贪污的现款为六十余万元。我觉得贪污犯罪在法律的意义上重于浪费，但浪费的损失则远大于贪污，积数千人的贪污款额比不上某一部门部分的浪费，这是惊人的对照。李富春副总理说“总之，今后国家必须在各方面建立一系列的节约制度和节约办法，规定那些是允许做的，那些是不允许做的。凡是那些不允许做的，如果做了，就是犯法。”我特别注意他这段话，我觉得过去对于反对浪费已有足够的重视，但仍有某些人仅仅重视贪污而忽视浪费，原谅浪费是不对的。过去对于经济的立法工作也觉得尚做得不够，我们再不能容忍因浪费而造成国家的巨大损失。因此我建议全国人民代表大会和常务委员会今后加强这方面的立法工作和监督其实施。五年计划是第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议制定的法律，是要全国人民共同努力共同遵守的。违反了或者不能完成计划任务是要负法律上一定的责任的。报告和计划中为实现每一个生产计划都列有必要的措施和注意事项，内中有某些是要用法令规定才能实现的，同时也是某些立法的根据。
    五年计划是以社会主义工业化为主体的，但必须发展农业来配合支援，五年计划对于农业已有足够的重视和适当的投资。组织农业生产合作社，是发展农业生产目前最基本的最有效的工作。我在开会以前曾到北京、天津的郊区和通县的乡区视察了若干农业生产合作社。我得到的印象是：1、各社在不同的程度上生产都是增加的，而且是逐年上升的。2、社员的生活也是在不同的程度上上升的，而且可以肯定逐年继续上升的，社员子弟人人能上学。3、账目能按月公布，贷款能按期还清。4、每个社都有它的特点，能适应环境条件建立不同的办法制度。从这些实例的证明，使我更加坚信农业合作化是走向社会主义的基本步骤，是目前增加生产廉价而有效的方法，只有完成农业合作化之后，农业生产和农民生活才能随着工业化的发展而相互的更加发展起来，提高起来。但是由于过去农业生产合作社发展得太快，有些对于自愿互利原则贯彻得不够，有些对于领导团结帮助个体农民的工作做得不够，一面发展同时整顿巩固是必要的。经过整顿巩固之后，农业生产合作社一定能够迅速而全面发展，一定能够完成农业增产和领导农村经济的伟大任务。
    实现五年计划是现在环境下的一种特殊阶级斗争。国内外敌人无时无刻地不想利用机会进行破坏，尤其对于在社会主义改造中某些阶级的某些人进行挑拨离间，使其不知不觉地踏上反革命的道路。因此，我们为了完成五年计划，必须长期提高警惕。比如像我这样的人们，在社会上有着不少旧的关系，在认识上残存着若干旧的思想，对于社会主义改造中某些必然的现象，往往因旧关系和旧思想的反映而致认识模糊，是很可以理解的，因此更宜加倍提高警惕。镇压反革命分子，巩固国防，才能保证五年计划的完成，也就是实现五年计划中应有的经常任务。
    第一个五年计划是中国计划经济的新纪元，是中国人民的经济大教程，正如宪法第十五条的规定：“国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全。”这个五年计划就是指导中国国民经济发展和人民生活改进的里程碑，它明确地指出国民经济生活在一定时期的一定进度和美好的国家远景。它的教育意义是十分重大的，中国每一个人都有实现五年计划的责任，每一个人都要努力学习这个课程，看清楚国家美好远景，就会克服当前的任何困难，这个五年计划已经给全国人民无限的希望和无限的鼓舞。
    中国共产党和毛主席是领导我们事业的核心力量，全国人民必须团结在中国共产党的周围为巩固国防实现五年计划而奋斗。
    陆定一代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理的报告和彭真副委员长的报告。我们讨论了第一个五年计划、预算决算、兵役法、黄河规划和人民代表大会常务委员会的报告之后，我们大家都感觉到，我们的人民真正是在当家作主，把我们的国家引导着走上繁荣富强的道路，走上社会主义的光明大道。
    我对于五年计划所规定的工业发展的速度，感到满意。我们第一个五年计划所规定的工业生产的发展速度，是每年平均增长百分之十四·七。这是什么意思呢？这就是说，如果我们能把这样的平均增长率保持下去，那末，我国的工业生产将每五年大约增加一倍，依照几何级数向上增长。这就是说，如果我们能够大体保持这个每年平均增长率，那末，经过十个五年计划，我们的工业生产可以比一九五二年增长几百倍。
    这样的发展速度，是社会主义的速度，只有在工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权之下，才有可能。在资本主义制度之下，在资产阶级专政的制度之下，任何国家，既不可能也从来没有实现过这样高速度的工业发展。至于半殖民地半封建的旧中国，当然更加不可能有这样的工业发展。
    为了比较，现在把两个工业发展最快的资本主义国家的工业生产每年平均增长率，和社会主义苏联的工业生产每年平均增长率的数字，列举如下：
    欧洲资本主义各国中，德国的工业发展曾是最快的。第一次世界大战以前，德国工业生产每年的平均增长率如下：
        一八六○——一八七○年　百分之二·七
        一八七○——一八八○年　百分之四·一
        一八八○——一八九○年　百分之六·四
        一八九○——一九○○年　百分之六·一
        一九○○——一九一三年　百分之四·二
    美国是全世界资本主义国家中工业发展速度最快的国家。美国工业生产每年的平均增长率如下：
      一八四九——一八五九年　百分之六·一
      一八五九——一八六九年　百分之八·二
      一八六九——一八七九年　百分之三·一
      一八七九——一八八九年　百分之五·五
      一八八九——一八九九年　百分之三·三
        一八九九——一九○九年　百分之五·一
        一九○九——一九一九年　百分之十一·五
      （这十年中，发生了第一次世界大战，美国没有遭到破坏，反而发了战争财。）
      一九一九——一九二九年　百分之三·八
      一九二九——一九三九年　百分之○
        一九三九——一九四三年　百分之二十二
      （这四年是第二次世界大战期间，美国又发了
  一次战争财。）
        一九四三——一九五三年　百分之○·四
    社会主义国家工业生产发展的速度就远远地超过了资本主义国家工业生产的通常发展速度。社会主义苏联的工业生产每年平均增长率的数字如下：
      第一个五年计划期间　百分之十九
      第二个五年计划期间　百分之十九·一
      第三个五年计划期间　百分之十三·五
      第四个五年计划是第二次世界大战后工业恢复时期的计划
      第五个五年计划期间（计划数字）百分之十三
    我国工业发展的速度，将与苏联相似，而大大超过一切资本主义国家的通常发展速度。
    在我们的面前，放着两条路。一条是社会主义的道路，这就是要巩固现有的工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权，实行社会主义建设与社会主义改造，使我们的工业生产水平在几十年内赶上和超过世界上最强大的资本主义国家。另一条路，是走资本主义的道路，这就是不要工人阶级领导的人民政权，来一个资产阶级专政，照资产阶级的意思办事，照资本主义国家的老路走去。这条道路，其结果将是帝国主义和封建势力的复辟。一百多年来中国革命的经验早已清楚地告诉我们，在资本主义已经发展到帝国主义的时代，要想走资本主义的道路，只是反动的妄想，只是为了帝国主义和封建主义的反革命复辟开辟道路。
    为了比较深刻地说明问题起见，我要请大家回忆一九二七年。那时，中国人民的民主革命眼看就要成功，北洋军阀坍下去了，可是在革命阵营内部发生了叛变。四月至七月，蒋介石国民党和汪精卫国民党相继叛变革命，他们骂共产党“过火”，说
  “共产主义不适合中国国情”，他们对民族资产阶级说尽了好话，向民族资产阶级保证他们自己不是帝国主义的走狗，并且答应搞一个资本主义的中国。当时，除了中国共产党和宋庆龄先生、鲁迅先生、郭沫若先生、何香凝先生和其他一些进步人士，看穿了蒋介石、汪精卫是帝国主义和封建主义的走狗以外，全国的资产阶级，包括民族资产阶级在内，是曾经相信过蒋介石、汪精卫的话的，是曾经把希望寄托在他们身上的。直到一九三一年“九一八”之后，民族资产阶级才开始觉悟到自己上了当，才开始知道蒋介石“好话说尽，坏事做完”，才开始知道蒋介石原来是帝国主义的走狗，不但不要劳动人民，也不要民族资产阶级的。一九二七年的反革命，和陈独秀的右倾机会主义，使中国人民在深重的苦难之上又加上了深重的苦难。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导之下，继续奋斗二十余年，经过了三个时期的战争，即第二次国内革命战争，抗日战争，和第三次国内革命战争，流了无数革命战士的鲜血，其中包括了李公朴先生、闻一多先生等人的鲜血，才达到人民民主革命的胜利。
    如果一九二七年蒋介石、汪精卫所答应的资本主义的中国只是一篇鬼话，只是向帝国主义和封建势力屈膝投降的遮羞布或者外衣，在这种鬼话、遮羞布或者外衣的后面，藏着的是反革命的复辟，那末，今天的所谓走资本主义道路的各种说法和想法，也不会高明一些，只是美国帝国主义所谓“自由主义的中国”即反革命复辟的改头换面的说法或想法，或者是一种无根据的幻想而已。当然，现在的情形，比起一九二七年来，已经大不相同了，人民的力量已大得无可比拟，人民的团结已经十分巩固，人民已经自己掌握了政权。但是，温习一下一九二七年的经验，是有好处的。我们可以从此更加深刻地懂得，放在我们面前的是这样两条道路：或者在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下走社会主义的路，以便我们的国家在几十年内赶上和超过资本主义最强大的国家的工业生产水平；或者走资本主义的道路，其结果是帮助帝国主义和封建势力的复辟。二者必居其一。中间的道路是没有的。我相信，全国人民是坚决赞成走第一条道路即社会主义的道路，反对走第二条道路即反革命复辟的道路的。
    我们把两条道路的问题提出来，是不是危言耸听，是不是“过火”了呢？完全不是的。我们第一次会议通过了宪法，宪法规定了走社会主义的道路。但是就在通过宪法之后，我们就查出了潘汉年的叛国案，就查出了胡风反革命集团。潘汉年和胡风，都曾是全国人民代表大会的代表，都曾亲自投过票赞成宪法。他们表面上顺着我们，但实际上，他们是既反对工人阶级领导的人民政权，又反对社会主义。他们要走另外一条道路，即反革命复辟的道路。潘汉年和胡风已经由全国人民代表大会常务委员会决定依法逮捕审判，这是完全正确的措施。
    潘汉年是长期埋伏在革命阵营内部的内奸。胡风所干的，是理论上的“挖心战”。说得形象化一点，大家看过德意志民主共和国的一个五彩电影，叫做“冷酷的心”，胡风就是那个影片里的“荷兰鬼”。
    为什么在我们的代表之中，会出现潘汉年和胡风这样的反革命分子？为什么他们用两面派的手段来破坏革命而不用公开斗争的手段来反对革命？难道这是偶然的么？
  这决不是偶然的。　这表明：
    第一，随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，阶级斗争不是缓和了，而是尖锐化了。剥削阶级里的反动分子，反对工人阶级领导的人民政权，反对社会主义。这些人民的敌人决不是软绵绵的，他们为了帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的利益，为了剥削阶级的利益，是要用尽一切手段坚决斗争的。不难设想，在实现五年计划的过程中，这种斗争还要加紧起来的。
    第二，中国共产党和人民政权在人民群众中有无限的威信，公开反对中国共产党和人民政权是立即会被人民识破的。在抗美援朝胜利，日内瓦会议和亚非会议之后，帝国主义者知道，用军事进攻的方法来推翻人民政权，来实现反革命的复辟，是没有什么把握的了。于是，他们就把希望寄托在从内部来破坏我们，这就是采取孙行者钻到肚皮里的战术，在政治法律、财政经济、文化教育、学术思想、统一战线、建党工作等等各个战线上来同我们进行斗争。为着进行这种斗争，他们就要披起好看的外衣，采取两面派的手段。
    人民日报编了一本书，叫做“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”。这本书对于每个革命者是一本极有教育意义的书，我愿意推荐给大会的每个代表。对于这本书，所有的反革命分子都是很注意的，因为那里有胡风反革命集团的许多密信，在这些密信中他们互相倾诉着不可告人的反革命的私房话，这些私房话正是得到每个反革命分子的共鸣的。我们希望，每个革命者要更加注意这一本书，要从这本书里学会本领，懂得在我国目前的条件之下反革命是怎样想法怎样活动的，懂得什么叫做两面派手段，懂得外表上看上去很“革命”的“马克思主义者”胡风及其反革命集团中的分子是怎样在背地里忙忙碌碌为反革命服务，懂得在自己这个部门自己这条战线上反革命分子可以怎样钻进来、怎样同我们斗争。如果我们大家能够因此提高了警惕性，学会了辨别暗藏的反革命分子的本领，学会了把这些反革命分子揭露出来的本领，那末，我们就从胡风事件中得到了宝贵的收获，这种收获就能帮助我们顺利地完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。
    有一种想法是危险的。这种想法以为，第一个五年计划的实现，将是风平浪静的，将是不经过严重的斗争的。应该知道，我们十分希望五年计划的顺利完成和超额完成，反革命却十分希望五年计划的失败。去年和今年，在实行粮食统购统销政策的问题上，可以看出是经过了严重的斗争的。对高岗、饶漱石反党集团的斗争，对潘汉年反革命集团的斗争，对胡风反革命集团的斗争，都是极其尖锐的阶级斗争。每一个这样的斗争，其结果都会影响到五年计划的成功或失败，顺利完成或受到挫折。因此，不能把实现五年计划的过程，仅仅看作是技术工作的过程，而应该同时把它看作是阶级斗争的过程。
    必须把反革命分子坚决、彻底、全部、干净地肃清出去。对反革命分子的任何宽容，都是对革命者的残忍。有人以为，胡风不能算反革命分子，因为他没有武器。照此说法，那末，戴季陶、陶希圣、陈布雷、陈果夫、陈立夫也应该不算反革命分子了，这岂不是极其荒谬的说法么？我们应该经常记住，在党政军民工矿企业所有的工作人员中，绝大多数即百分之九十几的人是好人，其中有些人有些缺点错误，但都是属于好人一类。但同时，决不能因此忽视了在这些工作人员中的确有少数是反革命分子，如果他们的阴谋得逞，那我们就会受到极其重大的损失，因为他们是一定要进行破坏工作的。如果我们大家都麻痹大意，反革命的全部阴谋得到成功，那就是反革命的复辟，就是我国倒退几十年。我们全国人民，人人都有责任，提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子。为了把这些反革命分子肃清出去，我们必须反对自己队伍中对反革命分子麻木不仁的右倾思想，这种右倾思想是只能帮助敌人，只能害我们自己的。
    我们必须注意思想工作。如果敌人懂得要在理论上来进行“挖心战”，难道我们可以把思想工作视若无睹么？为了实现人民民主革命的胜利，我国曾有过两次历史性的马克思主义的思想运动，一次是一九一九年的五四运动，一次是一九四二年的延安整风运动。五四运动把马克思主义的思想送到中国来，中国革命的面目为之一新。让我们想想，如果没有五四运动，没有马克思主义思想的来到中国，那末，中国革命面目一新这件事是可以设想的么？当然是不能设想的。延安整风运动，批判了主观主义、宗派主义、党八股的错误，总结了二十多年中国共产党奋斗的经验，再次确立了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的方针。这次思想运动，提高了中国共产党的理论水平，保证了我国人民在抗日战争中的胜利和全国解放的胜利。显然，如果没有延安整风运动，那末，在抗日战争和全国解放的过程中，我们可能还会跌交，还会犯错误的。
    我们从上述的事实中，就可以看到马克思主义理论的威力，看到掌握马克思主义理论这一件事对中国革命的极端重要性。我要再说一遍，我这里说的不是一般的重要性，而是极端的重要性。由此，我们也很容易懂得，为什么胡风反革命集团进行
  “挖心战”时会提出这样的纲领，这个纲领的第一条就是反对提倡学习马克思列宁主义。我们必须牢牢记住，反革命分子所最怕的，就是提倡学习马克思列宁主义。而中国人民要解放，要把中国建设成社会主义社会，就一定要学习马克思列宁主义，一定要以马克思列宁主义作为指导思想。
    如果为了完成人民民主革命，就需要进行马克思主义的思想运动，那末，为了实现社会主义，难道却反而没有必要来进行马克思主义的思想运动了么？当然不是这样。恰恰相反。社会主义革命，是比民主革命更广泛更深刻的革命。这个革命要永远消灭一切剥削阶级，要把千年以来习惯于在一小块贫瘠的土地上单独生产的几万万农民和成千万的手工业者变为合作社中富裕的集体的劳动者，要全国六万万人民在中国共产党领导之下团结一致艰苦奋斗。为了实现社会主义，必须进行比之从前更广泛更深刻的马克思主义的思想运动。
    中国共产党中央委员会今年三月曾经做了决定，进行宣传唯物主义和批判资产阶级唯心主义的思想运动。要求在八年之内，即到第二个五年计划之末，使全体（大约五百万）干部和知识分子的绝大多数懂得什么叫唯物主义，什么叫唯心主义，有那几种唯物主义，那几种唯心主义，以及什么叫做辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。并且经过他们，向全国人民进行唯物主义的宣传。
    绝不可以把唯心主义者同政治上的反革命分子混同起来。有许多唯心主义者在政治上是好人，是能够和共产党合作的。但是反革命分子一定是唯心主义者，胡适胡风就是明白的证据，他们都是主观唯心主义者。
    唯心主义者虽然有很大一部分能与共产党合作，共同进到社会主义社会，但是决不可以把唯心主义的思想作为我们建设社会主义社会的指导思想，因为唯心主义是资产阶级的思想。在我国进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，资产阶级思想的作用是，抗拒改造，阻碍社会主义建设，阻碍进步，腐化劳动人民，瓦解劳动人民的团结，一直到腐化和瓦解中国共产党。社会主义建设和社会主义改造，必须以工人阶级的思想即马克思列宁主义的思想作为指导思想。
    经过这样大规模的理论工作，就会使绝大多数的干部和知识分子提高嗅觉，学会在实际工作中去同帝国主义思想和封建思想，同资产阶级思想和富农思想，同主观主义和个人主义，同各种腐化堕落的倾向进行斗争。
    经过这样大规模的理论工作，就会形成全国人民在马克思列宁主义基础上的思想上和政治上的一致性，来实现社会主义建设与社会主义改造。
    这一个马克思主义的思想运动，对于宗教徒和一切非共产党员，当然应当在宪法所规定的保证宗教信仰自由，和中国人民政治协商会议章程所规定的自愿原则的基础上进行，即是说，除了共产党员必须学习和学校按规定的课程讲课以外，别人都是依自愿为原则。我们同反革命分子胡风之间的一个根本相反之点，就在于我们是积极提倡学习马克思主义，而胡风这个反革命分子则提倡大家不要学习马克思主义，要保持反动思想。
    我相信，全国的大多数知识分子和干部，全国大多数人民，将会逐步热烈地参加马克思列宁主义的学习，努力进行思想改造，提高警惕，肃清暗藏的反革命分子，我们要用这种实际行动，给胡风反革命集团的“挖心战”以有力的回答。
    五年计划，这是一个伟大的计划，这是一个社会主义的计划。制定五年计划，实现五年计划，这都决不是风平浪静的事情，而是阶级斗争，是社会主义道路和反革命复辟的道路两条道路之间的尖锐的复杂的斗争。社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作，必须有相应的思想运动和政治工作来保证它的完成。让我们团结起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，为社会主义奋斗，为第一个五年计划的顺利完成而奋斗！
    傅作义部长的发言
    听了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，使我感觉非常兴奋。正如毛主席所说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”，第一个五年计划，就是实现这个事业的第一步。我们一定努力完成五年计划草案所规定的水利工作的任务，以保证国家建设计划的胜利完成。
    在五年计划草案中，对水利建设的方针任务是这样规定的：“为着保证农业增产，必须努力地进行治水工程。在治本和治标结合及防洪、防旱、防涝兼顾的方针下，第一个五年计划期间内主要地是继续有重点地治理为害严重的河道，加固重要河流的堤防，大力地进行防汛工作，并积极地兴修农田水利。”根据这个规定，减轻水旱灾害，增加粮棉生产，是当前水利工作的主要任务。几年来我们在水利工作上，虽然做了很大的努力，但是每年还有几千万亩土地遭受水旱灾害，去年特大洪水，淹地面积更大，其中江淮流域是粮食高产地区，河北是盛产技术作物而粮食不足的地区，影响尤为重大。所以每年若能设法减轻水旱灾害，就等于增产几十亿或几百亿斤粮食。从发展水利提高农业单位面积产量上看，也还存在很大的潜力。改善水利设施，并与农业技术改良和施肥等结合起来，改旱地为水浇地，改无水利设施的稻田为有水利设施的稻田，改单季稻为双季稻，都可大大提高单位面积产量。为了保证社会主义建设的顺利进行，我们一定根据上述方针和五年计划中具体部署，继续努力，以求达到粮食与技术作物增产的目的。
    黄河的根治与综合开发工作，邓子恢副总理已作过详细报告。这是一个变千年水患为巨大水利，改变黄河流域自然面貌与经济面貌的不朽盛业。我们的祖先常常用“海晏河清”来形容理想的盛世，但“河清”毕竟还是消极的事情，只有在毛泽东时代，在中国共产党领导下，在开始进行社会主义建设的时候，我们才有可能来控制黄河，让它服从人民的支配，让它变成发展国民经济的巨大动力。我们水利工作者得以参加这个重大建设，都觉得无限光荣兴奋。目前我们的工作，一方面是与有关部门合作，积极进行黄河根治与综合开发的准备工作，同时要防止在三门峡水库完成以前黄河发生严重的决口和改道。这五、六年的时间，非常重要，黄河流域的人民，已经看见黄河的美好前途摆在眼前，决不能让它再在这几年内发生改道。目前已针对二百年一遇的洪水（即秦厂流量二万九千秒立方公尺），在进一步加固堤防，增修临时防洪措施，但是尚未全部完成，今年的防汛还要提高警惕，严密防范。
    根治淮河也是全国关心的问题。截至目前，淮河流域已经建成水库五座，正在修建的水库两座——南湾水库蓄水九亿立方公尺，梅山水库蓄水二十一亿立方公尺，目前都已修到可以拦挡洪水的高度。湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，连洪泽湖共已修成十六处。保护淮北平原和蚌埠、淮南市的重要堤防已经修到一九五四年洪水位以上。内涝严重的支流水系，已有十几条河进行整理疏浚。根据上述工程情况，如果再遇一九五○年的洪水，妥善运用各项工程，努力防守，可以保证主要干堤不生溃决。如果再遇一九五四年的洪水，亦可争取主要干堤不生溃决。内涝灾害，在已经整理的支流上也有减轻。但是，新培修的干堤多数未经洪水考验，有的仍须继续加强，有的汛期两面临水，在防守上，还要进行艰苦的战斗；上、中游有些支流的整理尚未完成，局部性的洪水内涝灾害，仍然难免。
    淮河流域水量丰沛，在全部蓄水工程完成以后，对灌溉、航运、发电事业，还可以做出更多的贡献。学习了黄河流域综合规划编制工作的经验，我们感觉过去治淮蓄泄兼筹的方针是十分正确的，但是在具体规划上还存在一些缺点，需要加以补充修订。同时，经过一九五四年洪水的考验，证明有些工程防洪设计标准偏低，现在正与有关部门合作，重新修订淮河的流域规划。
    长江流域，今年结合救灾进行了堤防整修工程。土工总量达三亿四千四百余万立方公尺。石工五十四万立方公尺。其中荆江大堤、无为大堤、同马大堤、武汉市堤防、南京市堤防、汉水左堤、荆江分洪区等重要堤防，都修到一九五四年洪水位以上，或平于一九五四年洪水位。洞庭湖进行了初步整理。防洪能力都比去年有所提高。
    关于长江的治理与综合开发工作，因为长江的流域面积广阔，流量巨大，流域内水系比较复杂，制定长江综合开发的规划比制定黄河规划需要更长的时间，工作也更为复杂艰巨。为了适应除害与兴利的迫切要求，过去交通部、燃料工业部对航运与水电问题，水利部长江水利委员会对防洪与综合规划问题，都在积极进行勘测研究，并且进行了一部分局部治理开发工作；现在政府又已聘请苏联专家组帮助编制长江流域规划。我们要与有关部门合作，积极工作，使长江流域规划早日编成，使长江流域早日免除洪水的灾害，并对发展国民经济逐步发挥其效用。其支流汉水经常发生洪水灾害，今年下半年开始举办下游分洪工程，并积极进行治本的准备。在长江流域规划编定以前，流域内有些工程与流域规划不相矛盾，如有些支流的水库，洞庭湖及其他湖泊的局部治理等，只要效益显著，技术准备成熟，在五年计划内也可择要举办。
    为了减轻河北地区严重而频繁的洪水内涝灾害，解决粮食增产问题，减轻全国粮食调运的负担，减轻洪水对天津的威胁，海河水系除永定河已开始治理以外，南运河、大清河、子牙河也急需进行治理。我们正与有关部门合作，编制海河流域规划，预计一九五六年完成。为使一些急要的工程得以提早设计和施工，其防洪排涝方案可在今年提出，并争取在第一个五年计划期内开始进行子牙河重要支流滹沱河的治理。
    东北的辽河，继续兴修支流浑河大伙房水库，并编制辽河流域规划。新疆玛纳斯河与乌鲁木齐河今年到明年编出流域规划。沂河、沭河与泗水地区一九五七年编出流域规划。巢湖、太湖开始编制流域规划。珠江先行拟定下游防洪排涝方案，并为编制流域规划搜集资料。钱塘江、闽江，除进行局部整治外，亦积极进行勘测研究。其他地方中、小河流的治理，对于减轻水旱灾害、增加粮棉生产，都有很大的作用。这些工作过去系由地方水利厅、局负责，但我们在领导上对这一方面抓得不紧，对各地治理中小河流的勘测设计工作，技术帮助做得不够。今后水利部和各级水利机构都要重视这一环节，积极帮助各地研究方案，以逐步减轻局部性的水旱灾害。由于水利工作直接关系广大人民生活的安全和农业生产的发展，全国人民对水利建设都有热切的关怀，各位代表对水利工作也提出很多宝贵的建议和要求，这对我们是一种莫大的鼓舞和鞭策，我们都要郑重考虑，求得适当的解决。
    根据前述工程情况，我们对于今年防汛工作的布置，是要求各地根据现有工程防御能力，定出防洪标准，坚决防守。对超过防御能力的洪水，要预筹临时措施，牺牲小部，保全大部，以求减轻灾害。对必须确保的重要地段，要用现有工程，配合临时措施，针对不同类型的洪水，预筹适当的对策，并进行必要的准备。现在长江、淮河、黄河、汉水、东北松花江、辽河都已不断涨水；华北地区，也已进入汛期；有些省份已经发生山洪和局部洪水灾害，但还来得及补救。今后一个多月，是防汛最紧要的时间，我们要高度警惕，为战胜今年的洪水、争取今年的丰收而斗争。
    为了迅速增加粮棉生产，还必须依靠广大人民群众，在全国各地普遍发展农田水利。发展农田水利，扩大播种面积，并提高单位面积产量，是全国农民支持国家社会主义建设的最有效的方法，也是增加收入，改善农民自己生活的最有效的方法。我们应该动员广大农民，因地制宜，发展各种各样的农田水利。其中小型农田水利费用省，效果大而快，分布广、数量大，可以充分利用群众的劳力、资金、智慧和经验。在全国灌溉面积中，小型水利占百分之八十九点四，在解放后五年新增灌溉面积六千八百万亩中，小型水利即占五千余万亩，对增加粮棉生产，作用尤为显著。应当根据民办公助的原则，加强技术指导，并利用低利贷款与投资的扶助，有计划有步骤地大力领导，以促进其发展。
    根据各地典型调查，各地小型水利都还有很大的发展余地。南方几省，多数塘堰只能抗旱三十天左右，其中能抗旱五十天完全保收的，不过占百分之二、三十。北方各省，河北灌溉面积只占全省耕地面积的百分之十三点四，在适宜打井的五十七个县中，只有十六个县已经饱和或接近饱和，其余各县水井不多。山东省总耕地面积一亿三千余万亩，现有灌溉面积只占总耕地面积的百分之五点七。据初步调查，有耕地三千万亩左右，可以利用地下水灌溉，如能将这三千万亩旱地改为水浇地，免除旱灾威胁，达到增产保收，这将会大大改变山东农村的面貌。我们认为在北方宜井地区，打井安水车，变旱地为水浇地，是当前增产最现实的办法，投资小，收效快，也易为群众所接受。在已成的灌溉设施中，加强灌溉管理，在逐步发展互助合作的基础上，有计划地提倡统一修管，合理用水，也有很大的潜力可以发挥。河南省百泉灌区，解放前只浇地十万亩，近年已扩大到二十六万亩，河北省房、涞、涿渠，一九四九年浇地十万八千亩，现在已扩大到二十一万亩。在北方井灌地区，山东全省平均每眼井浇地三点五亩，可是在地下水不太深的地区，用水车浇地一般能浇到三、四十亩。五年计划提出全国扩大灌溉面积七千二百万亩，除一九五三年和一九五四年已完成二千余万亩，一九五五年计划完成一千四百万亩外，今后两年还有三千八百万亩的任务，我们要根据上述具体条件，努力完成并争取超额完成这个任务。河北、山东、河南等省经常发生水旱灾害，更要配合河道治理，加强农田水利，以达到增产粮食与技术作物的目的。
    抽水机站是灌溉、排涝的有力工具，去年全国共有十七万匹马力，浇地五百余万亩，今年据十六个省不完全统计，已增加二万七千余匹马力，受益面积一百五十余万亩。为了解决抽水机用的油料困难问题，各地在研究使用蒸汽、水力、电力、风力，以代替油料。其中举办农村小型水力发电，是一个重要的发展方向，吉林汪清和辽宁桓仁的小型水电站都是设备简单，成本不高。桓仁电站发电二十瓩，成本二万五千元，可供各地推广的参考。
    水土保持工作的重要性，邓子恢副总理已经说得十分详尽。黄河流域的水土保持，要当作全国的重点，由各部门各地区合作，大力推行。其余永定河、淮河、绕阳河上游、以及全国各省水土流失严重地区，都应该努力进行试验推广。在每年全国水灾面积中，山洪灾害占很大比重，并且水势迅急，常常造成人民的死伤。要根治山洪灾害也必须依靠水土保持，同时有计划地修筑山塘和中、小型水库，以拦蓄洪水。这是一个很重要的问题，值得我们严肃注意。
    关于牧业用水问题，少数民族地区迫切需要解决。我们已与地质、农业部门合作，在内蒙缺水地区进行地下水探测，研究打井，然后再行推广。配合工业建设，进行工业防洪与用水的勘测设计，也是我们一项重要任务，这项任务关系国家工业建设，我们一定保证质量，按期完成。
    从一九五○年到一九五二年国家对水利建设的拨款总数为七亿七千余万元，五年计划的水利拨款总数为二十四亿九千余万元，这是一个非常巨大的数字，若再加上从节约项下增拨给农业、林业和水利部门五亿元中的一部拨款、水利贷款，农民在农田水利上的劳力与资金，数目更为巨大。就国家投资的数目说，我们认为已经能够基本上满足各地对于水利建设最迫切的要求，目前主要的问题，还在于勘测设计力量赶不上建设计划的要求。所以在过去两年中，有些工程项目，列了计划，到时不能开工，有些工程，设计不好即行开工，造成重大的错误和浪费，甚至影响整个水利基本建设计划不能百分之百的完成。目前我们虽然已经成立专业设计机构，进行全国水利工作勘测设计的计划管理，情况已有初步改善，但是完成这样巨大的建设计划，还要进行艰苦的努力。
    此外，我们设计、施工、管理工作上，也都还存在很多的缺点，除去李先念副总理所指出的大伙房水库的重大浪费以外，润河集分水闸进湖闸的静水池，设计存在缺点，去年放水时被洪水冲毁，危及闸身，不得不停止使用。高良涧闸设计水位偏低，放水时期为了保持安全，不得不加压钢轨，并临时在下游抛石作束水坝。今年修复润河集进湖闸静水池和加固高良涧闸，就重新投资二百余万元。南湾水库，过去因地质问题和沙料液化问题，曾两度停工，延迟工期一年有余，仅行政管理费即增加六十万元。一九五四年佛子岭水库一次失火，即损失五十四万元。其余资金器材的积压浪费，卫生与安全事故的不断发生，更是许多工地都有的现象。在房屋建筑上也有些单位追逐豪华的建筑风气，浪费国家资金。这些现象发生的原因，主要是我们在领导思想上对于节约对社会主义建设的重要性认识不够，也没有认真领导厉行节约反对浪费的工作。在决定工程上，还有盲目冒进的情绪，有许多工程设计不好即开始施工。另一方面是学习苏联先进经验不系统、不深入，有些技术干部还存在主观主义脱离实际的作风。同时也由于设计与施工，都没有及时进行专业分工，施工机构，临时组织，经验不能积累。这些缺点，我们有的已经设法改正，有的还要继续改正。
    最后我愿意说明，我们的水利工作，带有很大的地方性、群众性，过去取得的成就，都是同各地党政领导的支持，各级干部、特别是基层干部的艰苦努力，同各地劳动人民建设社会主义的热情劳动分不开的。今后我们一定继续努力，完成国家的计划任务，使祖国丰富的水利资源得到充分利用；使我们美丽而富饶的山河，随着五年计划的发展，出现更多的花果山、米粮川。我在这里向全国参加水利建设的劳动人民致敬，向引导我们进行伟大无比的社会主义建设事业的中国共产党和毛泽东主席致敬。
    龙云代表的发言
    自从去年九月召开第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过宪法以来，全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，遵循着宪法所规定的目标迈步前进，一年来在国内和国际方面，我们都已取得了辉煌的胜利。就国内来说，社会主义建设和社会主义改造已获得了很大的成就，加强了建设社会主义的力量和信心。中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次会议的召开，进一步扩大了人民民主统一战线，更广泛地团结了全国各族和各阶层人民，对于完成国家在过渡时期的总任务具备了更有力的保证。就国际方面说，亚非会议的成功，发展了中印两国提出的和平相处的五项原则，树立了反殖民主义的鲜明旗帜，发挥了我国在国际事务中的重大作用。对于打击帝国主义，缓和国际紧张局势，促进世界和平气氛是有重大的意义。这是我国和平外交政策继日内瓦会议后又一次伟大的胜利。
    现在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议已召开了。我在大会上听了李富春副总理关于第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告，我完全同意，衷心拥护。并建议大会一致通过。我又听了邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告，我听了这个生动的报告，感到非常兴奋，我预祝这个伟大的规划逐步实现，使历史上为害人民最大的黄河，今后变成有利于人民的黄河。
    我们的第一个五年计划，是我国历史上从来没有的一件伟大事业。我们优先发展重工业，必须如此，我国才能由落后的农业国变成富强的社会主义国家。这样我们才能有巩固的国防基础，才能更快地发展轻工业及农业，人民生活才能普遍的改善。我相信这一伟大计划是十分符合全国人民的愿望和要求，必然获得各国人民的一致拥护。
    我们知道，执行这个五年计划的过程中是艰苦的、困难的，但是我们有勇气、有决心去完成它。为了实现五年计划，我们必须厉行节约，反对浪费。节约是我国人民的优良传统，浪费不但削弱了国家的力量，而且是一种恶劣的行为。若不坚决反对，必然影响国家的建设，因此我同意展开一个全面性的节约运动。两年来全国各地存在的浪费现象，相当严重。据李富春副总理报告，不论在基本建设方面，不论在生产方面，或其他各种经济事业方面，都还存在着浪费现象，特别在非生产性的建筑中，铺张浪费的现象还相当普遍、严重。这是完全正确的。就我个人所知，仅以北京来说，建筑了许多富丽堂皇的办公大楼、大礼堂、俱乐部等不必要的非生产性建筑。这些建筑，用去了国家巨额的资金，实际上使用的时候少，空闲的时候多，其使用价值不大。当此国家开始建设期间，这种不急需的建筑是不应该的。又如食品公司向各地收购大量牲畜、肉食、果品及其他物品，因经营管理不善，造成严重的损失，仅以猪、牛、羊来说，沿途及到达目的地后，成百成千的死亡，闻之惊人。这样的浪费现象，若不严厉纠正，人民是不能容忍的。我希望有关各主管部门严格监督管理，消除一切浪费行为，务使有用的资金投入国家的生产建设。
    末了请大会允许我将我知道的地方的一部分情况作一简单的报告。我们国家实行粮食统购统销政策快两年了。在此期间，我本人多在北京，对于地方情形不甚了解。此次到山西作了一次短期视察以后，体会到这个政策在经济建设的五年计划中，对解决粮食问题是唯一的好办法。既保证了工业建设的需要，又稳定了物价。城市居民、灾区农民及农村缺粮户也能得到合理的供应。大多数的农民都认识到统购统销政策的正确性，一致拥护。但这个工作是艰巨而复杂的，是国家的一件大事。干部对执行这个政策的经验是不够的，农民是不习惯的。在实行过程中，难免不发生一些偏差，故曾有一度的紧张。潜伏着的反革命分子就乘机造谣，挑拨农民，杀害干部，毁坏仓库和牲畜。由此证明，反革命分子仇视我们的成就，蓄意破坏我们的经济建设。我们必须提高警惕，严厉镇压，从各方面肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，巩固我们的工农联盟，使我们祖国的伟大建设事业不致受到反革命分子的危害。
    全国各族人民、各民主阶层、各民主党派及一切爱国人士，团结一致，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，为完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    黄炎培副委员长的发言
    ——必须正确执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于第一个五年计划的报告，同时，还同意李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、彭德怀副总理关于兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告。
    这一伟大的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划规定了从一九五三年到一九五七年所有工业、农业、林业、水利、铁路、交通、运输、邮电、文化、教育、卫生、城市公用事业和其他都将在一定期限以内每项各增长多少多少。这是中华人民共和国宪法公布以后又一个关于建国的伟大文件。所规定的任务，多么繁重！艰巨！复杂！问：能保证完成吗？我敢肯定地答复：能。依靠什么？依靠中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明正确，依靠工人阶级的高度积极性和创造性，还依靠全国人民在劳动战线上对国家无限的热情、信心和勇气。
    第一个五年计划就要通过了。通过以后，就要成为全国人民今后共同奋斗的目标。我个人在兴奋、在惶悚，还联想到我所参加的中国民主建国会，将怎样和全国人民一道完成我们必须完成的空前伟大的任务呢？努力！我和会的同志们必须在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为胜利地完成这第一个五年计划所规定的空前伟大的任务而努力！
    那末，没有问题了么？我以为这样空前伟大的任务，我们必须满怀信心地同时还必须非常小心谨慎地来执行，特别是应该注意到执行中间可能发生的或过去曾经发生的几个问题。
          （一）
    五年计划在中华人民共和国，有它的不少特点，最大的特点，应该说是资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。“报告”说明：“由于我国的特殊历史条件，工人阶级同民族资产阶级在政治上和经济上存在着联盟的关系”。这中间包含着何等深厚的意味！办法是：定出改造的步骤，让工商业家有一个必要的时间，通过一些必要的过渡形式，逐步地接受改造，并且细致地、周到地分别对于资本主义工业和商业作了一系列的部署，把私营工商业存在的问题，全面考虑在内，真是无微不至，对他们惟一的要求，只是积极接受社会主义改造。工商业家大大感动了。可是还有思想没搞通的资本家，乐于接受安排，惮于接受改造。倒说：“这样很好，大家生意有得做，何必急急社会主义改造呢？”这真是大错误。这不过是一个例子。此外还有消极、依赖等错误思想、抗拒改造的活动和非法行为。我们曾经大声疾呼，也曾经苦口劝告：必须老老实实地遵守国家法律，言行一致，来接受社会主义改造。我们认定企业改造，必须同思想改造结合进行，在执行政策时，任何部分，尽管法良意美，都须反复又反复地展开宣传教育工夫，是值得注意的一点。
          （二）
    为了要求完成任务和超额完成任务，规定奋斗指标，这些指标的规定，都有科学上的根据，因此，是切合实际的。但在企业管理工作没有完全搞好的地方，有人不顾一切，盲目地要求突破指标；为了这点，过去几年在工矿等企业方面，曾经发生过不少问题。“报告”说：“有不少的企业在执行计划的时候，存在着忽松忽紧和前松后紧的现象”。“有不少的企业仍然经常发生伤亡事故和设备事故，造成损失”。这是值得严切注意的。当然，超额完成任务，是很好的。但必须采取进步方法：发明、发见且不说，如工作采用先进经验或提出合理化建议来减少原料、节短工作时间、降低成本，而仍能保持或者提高原有质量，这样才符合国家殷切的期望。“报告”说：“反对右的保守主义，也反对‘左’的冒险主义。”是正确的。我们不能不想到毛主席平日指示我们忠诚老实，实事求是，真是对病发药。
    前面所说“冒险主义”在“前松后紧”的情况下，当期限快满、任务还没有完成的时候，最容易发生，应当注意防止。“报告”为了保证工程质量，主张经常地对工程切实施行检查，十分必要，特别在五年期限将满的时候，必须予以高度注意。
          （三）
      “报告”对于第一个五年计划农业及其副业的总产值，规定了期限以内增长数字之后，还说：“上述指标，虽然已经比原来拟定的有所降低，但因为是以农产品丰收的一九五二年为基数，所以仍然是很高的，而且因为一九五三年和一九五四年两年的农业生产都由于灾荒没有完成原来拟定的增产计划，就增加了五年计划的后三年的增产任务。因此，要达到上述指标，还必须作很大的努力。”从这上边看来，对于农业，当然要求增产，但怎样达到计划上的增产呢？那只有依靠党和政府的领导农民和干部大家实事求是地干，来贯彻农业化的方针来达到这个计划。
      “报告”主张“国家在财力物力上，将全力支持农业生产合作社的发展”，这是完全正确的。“报告”还主张：“在努力发展农业生产合作社的同时，……仍然必须照顾单干农户的生产积极性，给单干农户以积极的帮助和领导，发挥他们生产的潜在力量，提高单位面积的产量”。这也是必要的。因为实际上单干农户在全国农村，还占不少数字，积极地帮助、领导单干农户，是有利于农业生产的。相反的，像七月六日人民日报“要满腔热情地团结社外农民”一篇文章所载，个别地方农业生产合作社所发生的偏差，可能影响到单干农户的生产积极性。邓子恢副总理一九五四年十月在全国互助合作会议上总结各地经验，提出办好农业生产合作社四条标准，第四是：“认真团结并帮助社外农民”。对“报告”中关于农业增产问题的有关规定，必须认真贯彻执行。
    我在这里愿附带说一下：关于农村粮食问题，从二月起，我接到了不少人民来信，我是每一件都转送国务院，中间看出这些地方紧张状态，我内心不胜忧虑，那时只凭各地报告，没有全面了解，因此，对缺粮情况的看法，今天觉得是错误的了。但我是一贯地知无不言的。到了六月，决定去江苏视察，临行，毛主席给我“全面分析”的指示，到了江苏，听取了省负责同志的报告，去若干县，看到农村一般情况，向农民们直接访谈，从我亲身接触，认清楚农民的生产情绪是非常热烈的；他们对粮食统购统销政策，一致地认为很好的。虽然所得到的只是“点”，但结合了省的报告，从江苏说来，是全面的了。那时闹供应情况是完全过去了。从江苏说来，就在闹供应的时候，省曾经仔细地加以分析，中间真正缺粮的，也不过百分之五左右。我们所接谈到的乡村干部，都受到党的教育，一切活动，都由党和政府正确掌握，在这点上我的反应是很大的感动和欢慰。我已经写了一份江苏视察报告，今后我必须吸取这次经验教训，努力学习全面分析，随时准备纠正过去的错误看法，但我还是知无不言，我认为是应该这样做的，陈云副总理二十一日那天的发言，我完全同意。
          （四）
    我们一定要厉行节约，一定要号召厉行节约，就拿工程来说，所要求的是朴实坚固，消灭了豪华装饰，结结实实地做，成本没有加多，有的使用年限反而加长，朴实与坚固结合起来，才是彻底的节约。但如果误会了节约的意义，以为节约只是省钱，材料无条件地改用次货，可以降低成本，说是节约；工程草率了事，可以减少人力，说是节约，这大大错误了。国务院一九五五年七月三日周总理关于贯彻节约方针的指示：“主要在……不降低工程质量的条件下，力求节约”，这是要点。执行五年计划，只有一面号召厉行节约，一面施行严格检查。我主张必须充分发挥毛主席经常地指示我们的忠诚老实，勤勤恳恳，实事求是的工作精神来正确执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，也就替第二、第三个五年计划打下非常坚实的良好基础。同志们！我国第一个五年计划是一个何等空前伟大的计划！它将开始改变我国百年来经济落后的历史面貌，把我国向工业化的社会主义社会的目标推进一大步，我们全国人民团结一致，跟着中国共产党和毛主席走，只要满怀信心地但也小心谨慎地正确执行，我们一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
