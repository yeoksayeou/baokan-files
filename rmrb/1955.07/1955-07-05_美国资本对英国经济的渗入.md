American Capital's Infiltration of the British Economy
By Okunev, correspondent for the Soviet newspaper "Pravda"

    In recent weeks, in the stock exchanges of New York and London, many stocks of large British companies have been snapped up by Americans. According to newspaper reports, the stocks of many companies have been sold out almost in the blink of an eye.
    The New York correspondent of the British business magazine "The Statist" wrote, explaining the exchange craze, "The Conservatives have won the election. This has opened up a field of activity for those who believe that it has become increasingly profitable for American capital to control British companies as partners."
    The British magazine "Labour Research" wrote uneasily in its June issue: "American big business is resolutely and quietly infiltrating all important sectors of the British economy."
    In the last decade, American investment in Britain has doubled. Most of the new American investment is concentrated in the British oil refining and machine manufacturing industries. However, other important sectors of the British economy are also subject to the fierce intrusion of the dollar. According to 1953 data, the total amount of American investment in British industry was $1,125 million.
    Today, many subsidiaries of American monopoly capital have become large and powerful companies in Britain. Among these companies are "Esso Petroleum Company" (a subsidiary of American monopoly capital "Standard Oil of New Jersey"), "Regent Oil Company" (a subsidiary of American monopoly capital "Texaco"), "Ford Motor Company" (a subsidiary of American Ford Motor Company) and "Vauxhall Motors Limited" (a subsidiary of American monopoly capital "General Motors of New York"), "Goodyear" and "Firestone" Rubber Companies, "Bakelite Plastics Company," and the giant "Monsanto Chemical Company."
    American subsidiaries such as "Thomas Hedley Co.," which produces chemicals, "Kodak Co.," which manufactures cameras and photographic materials, "Singer Sewing Machine Co.," "International Harvester Co.," "Hoover Vacuum Cleaner and Refrigerator Co.," and many others play an important role in Britain.
    American capital has also infiltrated British enterprises that produce ball bearings, grinding materials, mining machinery, measuring instruments, clocks, electric lights, office supplies, etc.
    According to the British magazine "The Economist," there were already 650 American companies and their subsidiaries operating in Britain by 1950. According to some economists, the total amount of British capital now controlled by American monopoly capital through its investments is about ten times its own investment.
    On January 17, 1955, the British "Financial Times" pointed out that in many industrial sectors in Britain, the share of certain commodities produced by enterprises controlled by American companies accounted for 33 to 75 percent.
    For example, the output of gasoline and lubricating oil by American subsidiaries in Britain accounts for more than 40 percent of the total. The output of tractors, combine harvesters, and many other agricultural machines produced by the American company "International Harvester Co." in Britain exceeds 50 percent. The output of various office supplies, such as typewriters and computers produced by the American monopoly capital subsidiaries "Remington Rand," "National Cash Register Co.," and other companies, accounts for more than half of Britain's production. The output of special carbon black manufactured by American enterprises in Britain ("Cabot Corporation" and others) for use in automobile tires and other rubber products accounts for more than 75 percent.
    The number of excavators and dredgers ("Euclid Company," "Bucyrus Company," and others), packaging and sealing machines, refrigerators ("General Motors," "Frigidaire," and others), washing machines ("Hoover," "Bendix," and others), and various electrical appliances and electric shavers ("Remington Rand," "Schick," and others) manufactured by American enterprises distributed throughout British territory accounts for more than one-third of the total.
    American capital occupies a very important position in the British machinery industry. The "Financial Times" wrote: "In fact, with the exception of a few machinery companies, all other companies that produce machinery either have American capital or belong entirely to American concerns and operate under license."
    British newspapers have cited many facts to prove that a very large proportion of the products manufactured by American companies in Britain are exported. All the silent typewriters exported by one large American company are manufactured in Britain.
    An important industrial sector in which American companies dominate is the production of tractors, combine harvesters, and certain other harvesting machines. The production of tractors by American enterprises in Britain has increased several times compared with pre-war levels, and three-quarters of the products are exported.
    How can we explain these and many similar facts that disturb the British business community?
    One of the reasons why American monopoly capital has increased its direct investment in Britain since the war is that goods produced on British soil can freely enter all markets in the "sterling area." Goods produced in the United States encounter high tariff barriers in the sterling area. However, agricultural machines and excavators, automobiles and chemicals, machinery and refrigerators manufactured by American companies in Britain can be shipped unhindered to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other markets in the British Empire, enjoying completely equal rights with British goods.
    The booklet "Factors Limiting U.S. Investment Abroad," published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in Washington in 1953, openly admits that one means by which the United States breaks through these tariff barriers is through direct investment into Britain. This booklet says: "An important reason for American companies to invest directly in Britain since the war is, in most cases, due to the endeavor to penetrate the vast and profitable markets of the sterling area and some other markets where American exporters encounter difficulties due to restrictions on imports paid for in dollars."
    The fact that Britain is a springboard for producing and transporting goods to the Western European market is also of great significance to American monopoly capital. Britain is also an intermediate station between the United States and the countries of the Near East for refining and selling oil, which American monopoly capital is increasingly extracting in large quantities in these countries. It was precisely the decisive role of American capital that increased the production capacity of the entire oil refining industry in Britain from refining more than two million tons of oil in 1938 to 28 million tons of oil in 1953, that is, an increase of nearly thirteen times.
    Therefore, for American monopoly capital, Britain is the most attractive country in Western Europe.
    The fact that at the end of 1953, the total amount of American direct investment in Western Europe was $2,367 million, of which Britain accounted for $1,125 million, that is, 48 percent of the total, is itself indicative of this.
    Figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce published in the November 1954 issue of "Current Business" magazine show that the average rate of return on American investments in Britain is 16.5 percent. Of course, compared with American investments in the Near and Middle East, where American oil monopolies earn 40 percent profit on invested capital, the profit is much smaller. At the same time, American investments in Britain are also much less profitable than American investments in British colonies, where American monopolies reap 48 percent profit. However, the 16.5 percent profit rate earned by American companies in Britain is also a considerable profit rate. It is 3 percent higher than the average profit rate of all American overseas investments. It is also much higher than the average profit rate that American monopoly capital earns from investments in other Western European countries. For example, in France and Italy, American direct investment has a profit of 10.5 percent, and in West Germany, it is only 8.5 percent, which is almost only half of the profit earned in Britain.
    One of the reasons why American capitalists can obtain high profits in Britain is also due to the relatively low cost of British labor. British, especially Scottish, wage labor is cheaper than American labor. Therefore, it is by no means accidental that most of the new American enterprises in Britain after the war were built precisely in Scotland.
    The British magazine "The Director" wrote: "The price of labor in Britain is lower than in the United States," "this is often...an important advantage."
    According to figures published by the British magazine "Labour Research," in the American "Vauxhall Motors Limited" in Britain, each worker's week of labor can earn the company a total income of fifteen pounds.
    What is the total income of American companies in Britain? According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the profits of American companies in Britain exceeded 68 million pounds in 1953, that is, equivalent to more than 190 million U.S. dollars.
    The entry of American monopoly capital into British industry is an unprecedented new feature of the British economy. Of course, some British financial oligarchies who have joined specially established Anglo-American joint ventures have increased their profits. But on the whole, the development of this process will inevitably cause great economic dependence on Britain towards America, and the result will inevitably cause political dependence.
    This process will inevitably lead to the intensification of Anglo-American contradictions, which have already manifested themselves in both the economic and political fields. People in the British business community have begun to understand more and more clearly that the current role of American monopoly capital in the British economy is that of a "Trojan horse," even more terrible than the ancient Greek legend of capturing the city of Troy.

### 美国资本对英国经济的渗入

　　美国资本对英国经济的渗入
　　苏联“真理报”记者　奥列霍夫
    最近几个星期在纽约和伦敦的证券交易所中，许多英国大公司的股票被美国人抢购一空。据报纸消息，许多公司的股票几乎一转眼就卖光了。
    英国商业杂志“统计家”驻纽约记者在说明交易所的这个热潮时写道：“保守党人在大选中胜利了。这样就给那些认为美国资本以合伙人的身份控制英国公司已变得越来越有利的人们打开了一个活动的场所。”
    今年六月号的英国杂志“劳工研究”不安地写道：“美国的大商业正在坚决地、不声不响地打入英国经济的各重要部门。”
    在最近十年中，美国对英国的投资额增加了一倍。美国新投资的大部分都集中于英国的石油精炼工业和机器制造工业。但是，英国经济的其他重要部门也受到美元的猛烈侵入。根据一九五三年的材料，美国对英国工业的投资总额，共计为十一亿二千五百万美元。
    现在，美国垄断资本的许多子公司在英国已成了大的公司和有势力的公司。在这些公司中有“艾索石油公司”（美国垄断资本“新泽西美孚油公司”的子公司），“李根特石油公司”（美国垄断资本“德士古公司”的子公司），“福特汽车公司”
  （美国福特公司的子公司）和“沃克斯霍尔汽车有限公司”（美国垄断资本“纽约通用汽车公司”的子公司），“固特异”和“费尔斯通”橡胶公司，“巴克列特塑胶公司”，巨大的“孟山都化学公司”。
    这样一些美国子公司，如生产化学品的“托马斯·海德莱公司”，制造照像机和照像材料的“柯达公司”，“胜家缝纫机公司”，“国际收割机公司”，“胡佛吸尘器和冰箱公司”以及许多其他公司，在英国都起着重要作用。
    美国资本也打入了英国的生产滚珠轴承、研磨材料、矿山机械、测量仪器、钟表、电灯、办公用具等等企业中。
    根据英国杂志“经济学家”的材料，到一九五○年就已有六百五十家美国的公司及其子公司在英国营业。据某些经济学家的意见，美国垄断资本借助于自己的投资，现在所控制的英国资本总额，大约相当于美国自己的投资总额的十倍。
    一九五五年一月十七日英国“金融时报”指出，在英国许多工业部门中，由美国公司控制的企业所生产的某些商品所占的份额，占百分之三十三到百分之七十五。
    例如，汽油和润滑油的生产，在英国的美国子公司的产额占百分之四十以上。拖拉机、联合收割机和其他许多农业机器的生产，在英国的美国公司
  “国际收割机公司”的产额超过了百分之五十。各种办公用具的产额，例如由美国垄断资本的子公司
  “莱明顿·兰德公司”、“全国现金出纳机公司”和其他公司所生产的打字机和计算机，就占英国产品的一半以上。由在英国的美国企业（“凯迪特公司”以及其他公司）制造的用于汽车外胎和其他橡胶产品上的特种炭黑的产额占百分之七十五以上。
    分布在英国领土上的美国企业所制造的挖掘机和吸泥机（“尤克利德公司”、“巴奇拉斯公司”及其他公司）、包装封塞机器、冰箱（“通用汽车公司”、“弗里吉戴尔公司”及其他公司）、洗衣机（“胡佛公司”、“本迪克斯公司”及其他公司），以及各种电工器材和电气刮脸刀（“莱明顿·兰德公司”、“桑迪姆公司”及其他公司）的数额占三分之一以上。
    美国资本在英国器械工业中占据了非常重要的地位。“金融时报”写道：“实际上，除了少数器械公司以外，所有其他生产器械的公司，不是有美国的资本，就是完全属于美国的康采恩并根据得到的许可证进行营业。”
    英国报纸援引了许多事实证明美国公司在英国所制造的极大部分产品都是输出的。一个美国大公司输出的无声打字机就全都是在英国制造的。
    美国公司占统治地位的一个重要工业部门是拖拉机、联合收割机和某些其他收割机器的生产部门。在英国的美国企业的拖拉机生产量比战前增加了几倍，而且有四分之三的产品是输出的。
    怎样来解释这些以及许多类似的使英国商界不安的事实呢？
    战后美国垄断资本所以要增加他们在英国的直接投资，原因之一就是在英国土地上生产的商品可以自由进入“英镑区”的所有市场。在美国生产的商品碰到英镑区的高的关税壁垒。可是，美国公司在英国制造的农业机器和挖掘机、汽车和化学药品、器械和冰箱，却可以毫无阻碍地运往澳大利亚、新西兰、南非和英帝国的其他市场，同英国商品享受着完全平等的权利。
      一九五三年美国商务部在华盛顿出版的那本
  “限制美国国外投资的因素”的小册子中，就公开承认，美国之向英国直接投资就是打破这种关税壁垒的一种手段。这本小册子说：“战后美国企业向英国直接投资的重要原因，在大多数情况下是由于竭力想渗入广大而又获利优厚的英镑区市场以及其他一些因限制以美元支付的进口货而使美国出口商遇到困难的市场。”
    英国是给西欧市场生产和运输商品的跳板，这一情况对美国垄断资本来说，也有很大的意义。英国也是介于美国和近东各国之间的一个提炼和销售石油的中间站，这些石油是美国垄断资本日益大量地在这些国家开采的。正是美国的资本起了决定性的作用，使在英国的整个石油提炼工厂的生产能力由一九三八年提炼两百多万吨石油增加到一九五三年的二千八百万吨石油，也就是说，增加了将近十三倍。
    因此，对于美国垄断资本来说，英国在西欧各国中是一个最有吸引力的国家。
    一九五三年末，美国对西欧的直接投资总额是二十三亿六千七百万美元，其中英国就占了十一亿二千五百万美元，即占总额的百分之四十八，这一事实本身即可作为说明。
    一九五四年十一月份的“商业现况”杂志所发表的美国商务部的数字证明，美国在英国的投资的平均利润率是百分之十六点五。当然，和美国在近东和中东各国的投资比起来，获利是少得多了，在这些国家里，美国石油垄断资本获得所投资本的百分之四十的利润。同时，美国在英国的投资也比美国在英国各殖民地的投资获利少得多，在那里，美国的垄断资本攫得百分之四十八的利润。但是美国各公司在英国所得的百分之十六点五的利润率，也是一个不小的利润率。它比美国整个海外投资的平均利润率高百分之三。它也比美国垄断资本从对西欧其他国家的投资中获得的平均利润率高得多。例如，在法国和意大利，美国的直接投资有百分之十点五的利润，在西德，只有百分之八点五，也就是说，差不多只及在英国获得的利润的一半。
    美国资本家所以能在英国获得高额利润，一部分也是由于英国劳动力比较低廉的缘故。英国的、特别是苏格兰的雇佣劳动力，要比美国的便宜。因此，战后在英国国内的美国新企业，大部分恰好是建立在苏格兰，绝不是偶然的。
    英国的“指导者”杂志写道：“英国的劳动力价格比美国的低廉，”“这常常是……一种重要的优势。” 
    根据英国“劳工研究”杂志所公布的数字，在英国的美国“沃克斯霍尔汽车有限公司”中，每个工人一周的劳动，可以使公司获得十五个英镑的总收入。
    在英国的美国公司的收入总额究竟有多少呢？根据美国商务部的数字，一九五三年在英国的美国公司的利润超过了六千八百万英镑，也就是说，相当于一亿九千多万美元。
    美国垄断资本的打入英国工业，是英国经济前所未有的新特点。当然，那些加入专设的英美合股公司的某些英国金融寡头集团增加了自己的利润。但是整个说来，这一过程的发展，必然会引起英国对美国的极大的经济上的依赖，其结果也必然引起政治上的依赖。
    这个过程将不可避免地引起英美矛盾的尖锐化，这类矛盾无论在经济或政治领域中都已显现出来。英国商业界的人士已开始愈益清楚地懂得，目前美国垄断资本在英国经济中的作用，——“特洛伊木马”的作用，要比古代希腊攻占特洛伊城的传说，还要可怕得多。（张振亚、张佐华译自一九五五年六月十八日苏联“真理报”）
