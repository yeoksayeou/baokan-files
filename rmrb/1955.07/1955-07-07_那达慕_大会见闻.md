Impressions of the "Nadam" Conference
　　Lin Mo　Alatan
　　The spring wind and snow have passed, the tense lambing season is over, and the summer grassland is a lush green. In mid-June, the Chen Barag Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a five-day "Nadam" conference. The herdsmen of the entire banner gathered together once again. There were especially many people attending this year, with herdsmen coming from hundreds of miles away on the grasslands, setting up yurts around the venue. There were countless vehicles all around. After meeting, people first congratulated each other on this year's bumper harvest. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the herdsmen of the entire banner overcame various disasters, achieving a lamb survival rate of over 95%, adding more than 50,000 head of livestock to the banner. How could people not joyfully celebrate! Looking back to the early days of liberation, the entire banner had only over 30,000 head of livestock in total!
　　This year, many herdsmen attended the conference as mutual aid teams, bringing their yurts. More than half of the herdsmen in the banner participated in year-round or seasonal mutual aid teams.
　　Next to the maternal and child health propaganda tent at the conference was the yurt of the Nashun Mutual Aid Team, closely followed by the yurt of the Bulegede Mutual Aid Team. Both team leaders, Nashun and Bulegede, joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1954.
　　Passing through the crowded crowd outside the department store sales tent, bypassing the cooperative canteen filled with customers, and walking not far away, was the yurt of the Huheletai Pastoral Production Cooperative. The yurt was hung with red and green award banners, with a radio placed in the very center. The cooperative's yurt became an object of visits and learning, with some coming to learn from their experiences, and others to see something new and unusual. Two women entered. One was Baozhao, the women's leader of the Renqin Year-Round Mutual Aid Team, and the other was Handa, the leader of a seasonal mutual aid team. They asked Bulesu, a female member of the cooperative, how women could play a role in the cooperative.
　　"Naturally, production in the cooperative is intense, and household chores must be done quickly, no longer slowly like in the past. Besides, our cooperative has also bought a hand-cranked sewing machine, which makes sewing clothes much easier," Bulesu introduced the cooperative's life to them as if chatting with family.
　　The fact that the cooperative had a sewing machine attracted these two women even more, and they asked a series of questions: How much does it cost to buy a sewing machine? Do you know how to use it yourselves? How many clothes can you sew in a day?
　　Like everyone else attending the "Nadam" conference, Bulesu originally wanted to watch the excitement, visit around, and take the opportunity to meet with relatives and friends she rarely saw. But with a constant stream of people visiting their yurt, Bulesu simply couldn't find the time to watch the grand occasion of the conference.
　　Various ethnic sports activities such as horse racing, wrestling, and archery were being held enthusiastically at the venue. Many people simply couldn't get enough of watching them. Horse racing alone had five events: long-distance, three-year-old horses, geldings, pacing horses, and trotting horses. The wealthy herdsman Haifu selected six horses from his herd to participate in various competitions, winning two first places, and also running at the front in several other competitions. These horses of his were all improved horses crossbred from "Sanhe horses" and Mongolian horses, which aroused the interest of many people at the conference.
　　After a day of intense activity, people also watched movies, watched the cultural troupe perform, and watched the songs and dances performed by elementary school children in the evening. Every program was a rare treat for the herdsmen living on the grasslands, and no one was willing to miss it easily. When herdsmen Gabalie and Nabusu came to see their ten-year-old child Mao Yihen dancing on stage in a floral dress, the couple laughed so hard that tears streamed down their faces. Gabalie said: "In the old society, children like this would still be barefoot, wearing ragged sheepskins, running and herding sheep in the meadows, things are really different now." Nabusu spoke to the Buhar couple sitting next to them: "Your child will be able to dance like this in a few years." "It's still early, ours is not even four years old yet!" Buhar's wife, Yangjima, said. Yangjima lowered her head and kissed her child, it turned out that her little daughter, Saihange rile, had already fallen sweetly asleep in her mother's arms. Yangjima has only been able to obtain this happiness of being a mother in recent years. Originally, they had been married for twelve years without having any children. In 1950, after the People's Government sent a venereal disease eradication station to treat them, Yangjima, who had been infertile for many years, gave birth to this healthy and beautiful little daughter. At the conference, how many women who had no children in the past are now, like Yangjima, happily holding their children, coming to join in the fun!
　　The last day of the conference was the most inspiring: awarding the models. The award recipients included more than twenty units such as advanced production mutual aid teams, cooperatives, districts, and villages, as well as five labor models, more than eighty production experts, and twenty-nine mothers with five or more children. They have made contributions to creating a happy new life for the people of the entire banner, and they have received honor in the applause and cheers of the people of the entire banner. The awards to the labor models were the most grand. The prizes for mothers with many children were the most generous. Five labor models walked towards the rostrum, at the front was Communist Party member Dagesleng, whose year-round mutual aid team was famous throughout the banner. To the sound of music, and under the admiring gaze of the people of the entire banner, five girls walked up, put new robes on them, tied silk belts around their waists, put flowers on their chests, and wrapped snow-white towels around their heads. In an instant, they became the honored guests of the people of the entire banner. The sixty-two-year-old man named Changshou was so excited that tears were about to fall, but he tried his best to hold them back.
　　"Everyone is happy, how can I cry?" he thought. But many past events涌现 emerged in his mind. This old man started working as a herdboy at the age of nine, and by the time of liberation, he only had a small calf; in recent years, relying on his hard work, he now has a hundred or so head of livestock of all sizes.
　　Among the production experts who received awards was also the famous wrestler of the banner, Huhele. This young man in his twenties developed an extremely strong body through labor. He won first place among the sixty wrestlers at the conference. His final opponent, Dalai, was able to last for four hours when competing with others, but was defeated by Huhele in just five minutes. Huhele is strong in wrestling, and he is also tireless in personal production and in his work for the public. He is a village head, a mutual aid team leader, and also a good hand at wolf hunting and herding. During the awards ceremony, he received four award banners in a row on behalf of the mutual aid team and the entire village, as well as for his personal achievements.
　　Daxi Deligeer, the wealthy herding household with the most livestock in the banner, also stepped down from the presidium of the conference to receive an award. He has made contributions to the work of surveying pastures; at the same time, due to his active management, his livestock has also greatly increased since liberation.
　　The awards ceremony is over, and dozens of dazzling banners are flying at the venue, inspiring the people of the entire banner to work harder and more bravely to create a happy new life.

　　“那达慕”大会见闻
　　林沫　阿拉坦
    春天的风雪过去了，紧张的接羔工作结束了，夏天的草原一片葱绿。六月中旬，内蒙古自治区陈巴尔虎旗举行了为时五天的“那达慕”大会。全旗的牧民又一年一度地欢聚在一起。今年到会的人特别多，牧民们从数百里以外的草原上赶来，在会场周围架起蒙古包。四外是数不清的车辆。人们见面之后首先互相庆贺今年的丰收。全旗牧民在共产党和人民政府领导下，战胜了各种灾害，使幼畜成活率达到百分之九十五以上，全旗又增加了五万多头牲畜。人们怎么能不欢乐地庆祝呢！回想起解放初期，全旗总共才有三万多头牲畜呵！
    今年，有许多牧民都是以互助组为单位，带着蒙古包来参加大会的。全旗有一半以上的牧民都参加了常年的或季节性的互助组。
    在大会妇婴卫生宣传棚旁边，就是那顺互助组的蒙古包，紧挨着的是布勒格德互助组的蒙古包。组长那顺和布勒格德两人都在一九五四年参加了中国共产党。
    穿过百货公司售货棚外边拥挤的人群，绕过那坐满顾客的合作社食堂，再走不远就是胡和勒泰牧业生产合作社的蒙古包。蒙古包里挂着红红绿绿的奖旗，正中间放着一架收音机。合作社的蒙古包成为人们参观访问的对象，有的来学经验，有的来看新奇。两个妇女进来了。一个是仁钦常年互助组的妇女组长宝照，一个是季节互助组的组长汗达。她们向合作社的女社员布勒苏打听妇女如何在合作社发挥作用。
    “自然啦，社里的生产紧张，家里的活得赶紧些，不能再像过去那样慢慢腾腾地干了。再说，我们合作社还买了手摇缝纫机呀，缝衣服就省劲多了。”布勒苏像谈家常一样向她们介绍合作社的生活。
    合作社有缝纫机的事情，更加吸引了这两个妇女，她们接连提出一连串的问题：买缝纫机要多少钱？你们自己会使吗？一天能缝几件衣服？
    布勒苏像每个参加“那达慕”大会的人一样，她原想看看热闹，到处串串门子，趁这几天和那些常年不遇的亲戚朋友们见见面。但到他们蒙古包参观访问的人接连不断，布勒苏简直抽不出时间去观看一下大会的盛况。
    会场上热烈地进行着赛马、摔跤、射箭等各种民族形式的体育活动。许多人简直百看不厌。光赛马就有长距离、三岁马、?马、走马、颠马等五个项目。富裕牧民海夫从他的马群中挑了六匹马参加了各项比赛，得了两项第一，在其他几项比赛中也都跑在前列。他的这几匹马都是用“三河马”同蒙古马杂交的改良马，这种马在大会上使很多人发生了兴趣。
      人们白天紧张地活动了一天，晚上还要看电影，看文工团演戏，看小学校儿童的歌舞表演。每
  一个节目对生活在草原上的牧民来说都是难得的，谁也不肯轻易放过。牧民嘎巴列和那布苏来，看到自己十岁的孩子毛依痕穿着花裙子在台上跳舞，两口子笑得眼泪都流出来了。嘎巴列说：“在旧社会，这样的孩子还不是赤着脚，穿着身烂羊皮，在草甸子里跑着放羊，现在真是不同了。”那布苏来同坐在他们旁边的布哈夫妇谈起来：“你们的孩子再过几年也能这样跳舞了。”“早着啦，我们的这个还不到四岁哩！”布哈的妻子杨吉玛说。杨吉玛低下头亲吻着自己的孩子，原来她的小女儿赛汗格日勒已经甜蜜地躺在妈妈怀里睡着了。杨吉玛能够获得这种作母亲的幸福，也还是最近几年的事。原来他们夫妇结婚后十二年一直没有孩子。一九五○年经过人民政府派来的驱梅站给他们医治了性病，多年不生育的杨吉玛，才养下了这个健康美丽的小女儿。在大会上，有多少过去没有孩子的妇女，现在都像杨吉玛一样，幸福地抱着自己的孩子，来赶热闹呵！
    大会的最后一天是最振奋人心的奖励模范。受奖的有生产先进的互助组、合作社和区、村等二十多个单位，有五个劳动模范、八十多名生产能手，还有二十九位有五个以上孩子的多子母亲。他们为创造全旗人民幸福的新生活作出了贡献，他们在全旗人民的鼓掌欢呼中获得了荣誉。对劳动模范的奖励最为隆重。给多子母亲的奖品最为丰厚。五位劳动模范向主席台走来了，最前面的是共产党员达格斯楞，他领导的常年互助组是全旗有名的。在音乐声中，在全旗人民爱慕的眼光下，五个姑娘走上去，把新袍子给他们穿在身上，把绸腰带束在他们腰间，把鲜花带在他们的胸前，把雪白的毛巾给他们包在头上。一刹那间，他们成为全旗人民的贵宾了。那个六十二岁的名叫常守的老头子，激动得要流出眼泪来了，但他竭力忍住。
  “大家都在高兴，我怎么能流泪呢？”他心里想。但许多往事却一齐在心里涌现出来。这老头子从九岁就当牧工，到解放时自己手下只有一头小牛犊；这几年靠他辛勤的劳动，已有大小牲畜百十来头了。
    在受奖的生产能手中还有全旗有名摔跤手胡和勒。这个二十多岁的青年在劳动中锻炼出一副强健无比的好身体。在大会的六十名摔跤手中他赢得了第一。最后一次同他决赛的对手达来，在同别人交手时能够一直坚持四小时，但到胡和勒手下，却不过五分钟就被摔倒了。胡和勒摔跤有力气，在个人生产和为公众的工作中也从不知疲倦。他是村长、互助组长，又是一个打狼、放牧的好手。在授奖中，他代表互助组和全村以及由于个人的功绩，接连领了四面奖旗。
    全旗牲畜最多的富裕牧户达西德力格尔，也从大会主席团的座位上走下来领了奖。他对勘查牧场的工作有所贡献；同时，由于他的积极经营，解放后他的牲畜也有了很大的增加。
    发奖结束了，几十面耀眼的锦旗飘扬在会场上，它鼓舞着全旗的人民，更加勤劳和勇敢地创造幸福的新生活。
