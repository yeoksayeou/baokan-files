Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. Deputies attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress have been visiting a model and picture exhibition introducing the comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources on the 19th and 20th.

This exhibition room was specifically organized to assist the deputies in discussing the comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling and developing the Yellow River. On the afternoon of the 19th, six groups of deputies had already visited the exhibition room. On the 20th, eleven more groups completed their visits. The remaining groups will also visit in the coming days.

Today, many groups visited the model of the "First Phase Project and Future Prospects Schematic Diagram for Comprehensive Utilization of the Yellow River" and listened to the explanations of the guides. Many deputies stated after the visit that this visit was of great help to them in discussing the fundamental control and development of the Yellow River.

The exhibition room is located in the West Rest Room of Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. Many models, charts, photographs, and installations, as well as some active slides on various models, show the general situation of the Yellow River Basin, the historical changes of the river and the disasters they brought to the people, especially the two serious disasters caused during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek government. It also introduces the various achievements and benefits that the people of the provinces in the Yellow River Basin have achieved in the past few years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in terms of Yellow River control. The general situation of the first phase project and future projects of the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River can also be seen from the exhibition room. Many photos also focus on introducing the guidance of Soviet experts to Chinese engineering personnel in the planning work of the Yellow River Basin and their surveys with Chinese survey teams. In many photos, one can also see countless leveling teams, surveying teams, and geological survey team members, drilling workers, farmers, hydrological workers, and sediment researchers, working enthusiastically, intensely, and arduously in their respective positions to conquer the Yellow River and make it benefit the people.
