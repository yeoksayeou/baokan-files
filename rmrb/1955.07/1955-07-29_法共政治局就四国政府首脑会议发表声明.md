    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 27th: According to TASS, the Politburo of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the Geneva Four-Power Summit, saying that the Geneva meeting confirmed that it is possible to consolidate peace by developing peaceful coexistence and cooperation between peoples of all countries, that is, on the basis of abandoning the "Cold War" and "position of strength" policies. The statement said that if the London and Paris Agreements hindering German reunification had not been ratified, the meeting could have led to even greater achievements.

    The statement said that if the people of all countries do not relax their efforts to strive for peace, the instructions passed by the heads of government will be realized. The Politburo calls on all French workers and patriots to demand that the government implement an independent policy in line with the national interests of France (signing a European collective security treaty, refusing to implement the London and Paris Agreements, abolishing foreign military bases on French territory); to ensure the success of the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, and to this end, to more actively launch the campaign to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" against atomic warfare and for universal disarmament; to ensure that the French government strictly implements the Geneva Agreements on Indochina, especially the part on preparing for general elections in Vietnam; and to strive for the French government to recognize the People's Republic of China and its right to Taiwan, as well as its legitimate status in the United Nations.

    The statement of the Politburo emphatically pointed out that while striving to complete these tasks, the French people will promote the success of the four foreign ministers' meeting to be held in October.

    法共政治局就四国政府首脑会议发表声明
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：法国共产党政治局就日内瓦四国政府首脑会议发表声明说，日内瓦会议证实，通过发展和平共处和各国人民之间的合作的办法，即在放弃“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的基础上巩固和平是可能的，声明说，假如阻碍德国统一的伦敦和巴黎协定不曾批准，那末这次会议还可以导致更大的成就。
    声明说，如果各国人民不放松为争取和平所作的努力，政府首脑通过的指示将得到实现。政治局号召法国全体劳动者和爱国志士要求政府实行符合法国民族利益的独立政策（签订欧洲集体安全条约、拒绝实施伦敦和巴黎协定、取消外国在法国领土上的军事基地）；要求保证联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的工作获得成功，为此要更积极地展开为反对原子战争和争取普遍裁军的“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动；使法国政府严格履行关于印度支那的日内瓦协定，特别是关于准备在越南举行普选的部分；力求法国政府承认中华人民共和国和承认它对台湾的权利以及它在联合国的合法地位。
    政治局的声明着重指出，在争取完成这些任务的同时，法国人民将促使在十月举行的四国外长会议取得成就。
