Seeing the Bright Future of the Motherland from the Self-Study of Junior and Senior Primary School Graduates
——My Experiences After Inspecting the Self-Study of Shanghai's Junior and Senior Primary School Graduates
National People's Congress Representative, Shu Xincheng

    The Characteristics of Shanghai's Junior and Senior Primary School Graduates
    Based on the current conditions of the country, junior and senior primary school graduates cannot all continue their education or find employment, and a portion must engage in self-study; however, there are differences between rural and urban areas. In cities, especially a metropolis like Shanghai with over seven million people, more than half of junior middle school graduates and over 80% of senior primary school graduates are below the legal working age, and they have very little means of production. At the same time, the employment of personnel in factories is planned. Currently, even young people of working age cannot enter factories at any time, much less all of them. They must obey national plans and gradually take up production positions according to the needs of the country. Therefore, for junior middle school graduates, especially those below working age and the vast majority of senior primary school graduates, in addition to strengthening labor education, there must be self-study organizations to meet their needs and the needs of society. Furthermore, in Shanghai, over 20,000 junior and senior primary school graduates could not continue their education or find employment last year, and this number will accumulate to over 50,000 this year. I have been paying attention to this issue since 1953. During the summer vacation of 1954, I participated in some parent meetings, spoke to senior primary and junior middle school graduates, and also wrote articles in newspapers. However, because I did not delve deeply enough, what I said and wrote was mostly general policy propaganda and lacked personal experience. This year, knowing the importance of this issue more clearly from the numbers, I decided to treat it as one of the key issues and conduct an inspection in Shanghai.

    Social Concerns Regarding Self-Study
    In early June this year, Shanghai held a meeting of representatives of graduating junior middle school students. I participated and learned about the thoughts of some students and parents before the meeting. During inspections of middle schools after the meeting, I held discussions with student representatives and participated in parent meetings for graduating students, and also discussed the issue of self-study with teachers. As far as I could ascertain, teachers, students, and parents all understand the general principle of obeying national plans and supporting socialist construction through self-study. However, when it comes to specific individual issues, many people have concerns. In addition to underestimating self-study, the main concerns are: (1) Young people are young. In school, they have direct supervision from teachers. Now, with broadcast teaching, teachers have no way of knowing whether students are listening or not, and no one checks how well they are learning. Therefore, it is difficult to believe in the achievements of self-study. (2) Language and social sciences may be learned well through listening to broadcast, but learning natural sciences must be done through direct instruction and experiments. In broadcasting, teachers and students do not meet, so there is no direct instruction. There is also no way to experiment. Even if students listen attentively and study hard, they cannot express the mechanical, physical, chemical, and other knowledge in books through production or experiments. Therefore, everyone lacks confidence in self-study of natural sciences. (3) Young people like activities, and their bodies and minds are developing. In addition to reading, they should have cultural and recreational activities, physical exercise, and especially the cultivation of communist moral character, to fulfill Chairman Mao's "three goods" instruction. Listening to broadcast for self-study only takes two class periods a day. Even if language and natural sciences can be learned well, how will other aspects like physical education, moral education, and aesthetic education be carried out? If these aspects are not coordinated, and young people are not educated for "all-round development," what is the use of learning language and natural sciences well? This is what most people are concerned about. In addition, there are issues such as parents being too busy with work to take care of their children's studies, or having low cultural levels and being unable to educate their children, or some hooligans and illegal capitalists often enticing young people to take the wrong path, and parents being unable to supervise and correct them, etc. I will not go into detail here.

    Answers Obtained from This Inspection and the Shanghai Junior and Senior Primary School Graduates' Self-Study Achievement Exhibition
    In addition to myself, nine municipal people's representatives participated in this inspection of self-study groups in Shanghai, inspecting 17 junior middle school self-study groups and 4 senior primary school self-study groups, and holding two parent symposiums. As I was also involved in inspecting secondary education and other work, I only inspected two junior middle school self-study groups, one senior primary school group, participated in one parent symposium, visited the self-study achievement exhibition once, and participated in a summary meeting of the inspection group and a summary meeting of the education inspection group. The answers given here are a combination of the summaries and personal experiences.

    First, it should be stated whether young people can study independently. In September 1954, Shanghai organized 1,038 junior middle school graduate self-study groups, totaling 12,201 people, and 641 senior primary school groups, totaling 7,637 people. Now, excluding those who have joined the workforce, there are still 678 groups, totaling 6,637 people. The junior middle school self-study groups mainly rely on listening to broadcast for self-study, with assistance and guidance from the radio station, original school teachers, and society when necessary. The senior primary school self-study groups are organized into 158 platoons, with three full-time general instructors and 440 part-time platoon instructors (mainly junior middle school graduates). As far as we have inspected and understood, these many self-study groups can basically persist in learning and have achievements and confidence. From the 1,200 or so exhibits in the exhibition, it can be seen that regardless of whether they are junior or senior primary school graduates, or what subject, and even in terms of physical development, physical exercise, and moral character, they have made certain achievements. This shows that junior and senior primary school graduates can study independently under leadership and organization. Secondly, whether natural sciences can be learned to a certain extent through self-study was also clearly answered in this inspection and exhibition. During our inspection, the self-studying students from junior and senior primary schools told us how they used scrap iron and waste materials to make various models. In the exhibition, we saw dozens of times more models and experiments related to mechanics, physics, and chemistry than we heard about. What impressed us the most was a model of a mountain valley reservoir and hydroelectric power equipment. This was an achievement of the Seagull Self-Study Group in the North Sichuan Road District. Initially, when they heard about the series and parallel connection of light bulbs in physics class, they wanted to make a model to experiment with. One student thought that they had learned about water turbines and hydroelectric power equipment in the past and suggested combining them to make a large model. So, everyone piled up mountain valleys and riverbeds on a small blackboard, built a reservoir in the valley, and diverted tap water to flow down from the reservoir, driving the water turbine and generator. The electricity generated could light up dozens of small light bulbs (flashlight bulbs) in the valley, displaying a magnificent night scene of hydroelectric power generation. They were also able to demonstrate electrolysis of water, electrolysis of salt water solution, copper plating, obtaining oxygen by heating potassium permanganate, extinguishing fire with carbon dioxide, and other experiments in front of the audience and explain them in detail. In addition, a large number of electric motor models were displayed, each of which could be rotated by turning on the current, and radios could be used for everyone to listen, strongly answering the general public's doubts about the inability to self-study natural sciences. Third, the students told us that they regularly organized cultural and recreational and sports activities: usually there were choirs, recitations, music teams, dance teams, literary reading report meetings, basketball teams, physical exercise classes, and drama performance teams. During spring break, they also organized spring outings to the suburbs and also held sports meets and organized literary and artistic performances by district. They also regularly participated in neighborhood work and public welfare labor. When the Zhongshan Park Cultural Center held the "We Must Liberate Taiwan Exhibition," students from the Jiangning District "May 4th" group served as narrators. The vast majority of students in the self-study groups served as teachers in neighborhood literacy classes - nine of the ten members of the Changning District "April 11th" self-study group participated in cultural and educational work. Within a year, more than 7,900 people participated in production labor, including more than 1,000 who went to the Northwest. Every letter from them was full of joy and excitement, willing to contribute everything to the construction of the Northwest. In the exhibition, we saw the "April 11th" self-study group's library; various household items embroidered and machine-embroidered by the self-study groups; a large oil painting of Gorky and various traditional Chinese paintings, pastel paintings, and sketches; various photos of choir performances, drama performances, and playground activities; a record table showing that the students in the Wu Yunduo group on North Sichuan Road gained an average of nearly ten pounds in weight; informative wall newspapers; a one-act play "The Flower That Will Bloom" which took half a year and three revisions to complete; and continuously updated self-study diaries. From the above facts, it can be seen how rich and pleasant the self-study life of junior and senior primary school graduates is, how normal their health and development are, and how their communist moral character is improving.

    The Key to Self-Study Achievement
    The various facts mentioned above are only the good side. These achievements are not the case for every group. Some groups have made few achievements, or even none at all. We cannot only see the achievements, much less exaggerate the achievements and ignore the difficulties. These achievements are conditional. Based on our inspection and visit to the exhibition, there are the following conditions.

    (1) Organized, Led, and Planned: Last summer vacation, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Education Bureau, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the district civil affairs departments jointly organized junior and senior primary school graduates, dividing them into self-study groups based on their school or district, with more than ten people in each group. Junior middle school students elected group leaders, and senior primary school students were assigned instructors to lead their studies. The Education Bureau selected outstanding primary and secondary school teachers and general instructors to teach and guide broadcast lectures for self-study students. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Democratic Youth Federation led various activities and moral character cultivation. The Women's Federation and the district civil affairs departments provided specific assistance to the self-study groups in terms of venues and radios. Each day, two class periods were broadcast to the junior and senior primary school self-study students. The teaching materials were edited by the Education Bureau with the assistance of the Science Popularization Association. The district committees of the Communist Youth League and the Democratic Youth Federation led various activities and moral character cultivation. The Women's Federation and the district civil affairs departments provided specific assistance to the self-study groups in terms of venues and radios.

    (2) Social Concern and Support: This exhibition is divided into three parts. The general theme of the first part is "Social Concern." Under this large headline of "Social Concern," the first thing that caught our eyes was a letter from the Secretariat of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee to the self-study students in Shanghai. The letter said: "The letter written to Chairman Mao has been received. It is very good that you are working hard in self-study, actively participating in social work, improving your political and cultural level, and strengthening your labor viewpoint. I hope you will continue to work hard to prepare for future labor production." A self-study student serving as a narrator standing next to the letter told us with great excitement how happy they were when they received this letter and how it encouraged them to study hard. In addition, a large number of letters were hung on the wall: some from the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front and the People's Liberation Army troops guarding the coastal defense front, some from the construction site in Xi'an, and some from former self-study students who were far away in Qinghai and Xinjiang participating in the construction of the motherland. These letters encouraged them to study, advised them not to be proud, and inquired about any difficulties they had and would try their best to help solve. From these letters, we can see the concern of all sectors of society for the self-study students. Below these letters were the exhibition stands: on the stands were many gifts: bronze drums, bugles, accordions, erhus, various balls, chess, rackets, books, copies, etc., which were given to them by parents, neighborhoods, and students who participated in labor. We also learned from the inspection and the narrators that many parents and neighborhood committees and schools, under very difficult conditions, vacated rooms, borrowed rooms, borrowed radios, borrowed newspapers, and borrowed books for the self-study groups, and also tutored them. Some factories opened their factory grounds to welcome self-study students to exercise. Stadiums and parks were often open to them for free. Libraries held literary report meetings for them. The Science Popularization Association held popular science lectures for them. Experts held self-study lectures for them. Technicians helped them find waste materials, build lathes, and radios. Students from East China Normal University helped them make models of the "contact method for sulfuric acid." In short, from the inspection and the exhibition, we felt that from Chairman Mao downwards, it seemed that everyone was united as a whole, caring for and supporting the self-study of junior and senior primary school graduates.

    (3) Students' Initiative and Effort: The second major heading of the exhibition was "Overcoming Difficulties." The self-study students had many difficulties: first, the influence of old social ideas on them. This means that the remnants of the idea that "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior" still dominate many people and affect the self-study students' views on self-study. The second is the obstruction of economic problems: older students with more difficult family situations need to find employment for livelihood, but they cannot be assigned to participate in production labor for the time being. Self-study contradicts their actual needs, so it is difficult to settle down. The third is the obstruction of learning habits: in school, there is direct guidance from teachers and collective activities of students, but now it has been changed to broadcast teaching. They feel unaccustomed to learning and somewhat lonely in life - especially young students, so they often cannot listen to the broadcast. If they do not listen carefully and review in time at the beginning, it will be even more difficult to catch up later, and eventually they will not be able to listen anymore: this is the reason why some groups cannot continue. The fourth is the difficulty of practice and experimentation: they listen to the broadcast very carefully, but if they have problems, they cannot ask the teacher for guidance at any time as in school. They cannot get teacher feedback on exercises or compositions at any time. They cannot have sufficient instruments, experimental materials, and laboratories for science experiments as in school, so learning requires more effort. The various difficulties mentioned above have prevented some self-study groups from continuing or from continuing to progress, and have also tested many groups, enabling them to continue to progress, firmly master knowledge from hard study, train their work ability from social work, and improve their moral character. Many examples of overcoming difficulties were seen in the inspection and exhibition.

    Problems and Suggestions
    Shanghai has achieved great success in organizing junior and senior primary school graduates to study independently in the past year. However, because this is a new undertaking with no precedent to follow, and because this undertaking is not only related to the Shanghai area but also to the whole country, and not only today but also a long-term issue, we must never be satisfied with the existing achievements, but strive to improve on the existing basis. Therefore, based on some of the problems discovered during the inspection, I would like to make some preliminary suggestions here.

    The first problem we saw was dispersed leadership: As mentioned earlier, the Education Bureau, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the civil affairs agencies, and the labor agencies all lead self-study, but because there is insufficient contact, the various parties do not understand each other's work very well, resulting in disconnections. For example, when the labor department assigns self-study students to participate in production labor, it often does not go into in-depth understanding with the self-study leadership agency, but uses the old information from the school as the standard, resulting in some people being assigned three times and unwilling to go, and being assigned a fourth time, while some young people who are older, have poor families, and study well have never been assigned. The groups we inspected all raised the same issue and expressed dissatisfaction. Other incidents of mutual disconnection also occur frequently. Therefore, we suggest that the various leading departments organize a unified leading agency, jointly discuss and formulate specific plans based on national policies and local conditions, whether it is organizing students' self-study, selecting broadcast teachers and instructors, compiling teaching materials, arranging cultural and recreational and sports activities, participating in social work and public welfare labor, mobilizing social forces, holding various lectures, or assigning participation in production labor, all of which should be uniformly arranged by this agency to enable self-study to develop more planned and balanced. The second is the unclear direction of self-study: Everyone lacks a consistent view on the purpose of self-study for junior and senior primary school graduates, so the content of broadcast teaching was more focused on industrial mechanics in the previous period, and later it was changed to both reviewing old lessons and preparing for labor. In addition, some students who graduated from junior and senior primary schools in 1953 are studying independently at the same time as students who graduated in 1954. In the second half of this year, students who graduated from 1953 to 1955 may be studying independently at the same time, and it is absolutely impossible to continue to handle it in the same way as in 1954. Therefore, we suggest that the content of teaching materials should be determined in accordance with the established policy, that is: for senior primary and junior middle school graduates, it should be to consolidate existing knowledge and continue to improve on the original basis, so as to prepare them for future schooling or participation in production labor. This year, the broadcast teaching for junior and senior primary school graduates who graduated last year should best open higher classes to avoid them repeating learning. We believe that the self-study of junior and senior primary school graduates should be linked to the national construction plan and is a relatively long-term task. Therefore, it is recommended that governments and social groups at all levels organize self-study for junior and senior primary school graduates who have not been able to continue their education or participate in labor. The third is that although broadcast teaching has its advantages and achievements, it also has its limitations. The achievements in natural sciences and language, painting, etc. shown in the exhibition are not only due to the efforts of the students, but also the direct help given to them by teachers, workers, and parents should be regarded as one of the factors that can lead to achievements. Therefore, I suggest that the science laboratories of each school, the science experiment stations of each district, and the various sports venues and general libraries should, according to the specific circumstances of each place, set up full-time experiment, sports, and library instructors to guide self-study students in science experiments, physical exercise, and book reading, and mobilize factories to organize self-study students to visit and learn, so that students can receive direct guidance from mentors and obtain practical knowledge of factories in addition to broadcast teaching. In addition, various guiding agencies can organize various lectures under the leadership of the unified self-study agency to enrich the students' learning life.

    The above are some of the problems and suggestions that our self-study inspection group and I personally have discovered regarding self-study.

    Conclusion
    After inspecting the self-study groups of junior and senior primary school graduates in Shanghai, we deeply realized the superiority of the people's democratic system: the achievements of self-study in Shanghai in the past year are first due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government. Although there are still shortcomings in the specific work, the youth have been organized and have received care and support from all parties. The youth have not only made achievements in their studies and progress in their moral character, but their political level has also been improved. The junior middle school self-study groups we inspected all requested to hear reports on the Hu Feng incident, and all expressed strong class hatred for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. When I was in Penglai District and had a discussion with the Li Dazhao self-study group, the young people asked me that when I attend the National People's Congress meeting this time, I must ask the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to first revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative. They can overcome all difficulties in their studies. When explaining at the exhibition, everyone said: "We have confidence and a future; our future is contained in the bright future of the motherland." From their brave, confident, happy, lively, and patriotic, hate-the-enemy, love-labor, and fearless-of-difficulties images, we saw the bright future of the motherland. We have a responsibility to contribute all our strength to cultivate the younger generation and build the motherland into a great socialist country!

    从初中高小毕业生自学看祖国的光辉前途
    ——我视察上海市初中高小毕业生自学后的体会
    全国人民代表大会代表　舒新城
    上海初中和高小毕业生的特点
    根据国家目前的条件，初中和高小毕业生不能全部升学或就业，而必须有一部分自学；但农村和城市各有其特点。就城市来说，尤其如上海这样拥有七百多万人的大都市，初中毕业生有一半、高小毕业生则有百分之八十以上的年龄不及劳动年龄，他们也很少有什么生产资料；同时，工厂的进用人员都是有计划的，在目前，就是劳动适龄的青年也不能随时、更不能全部进工厂工作。他们必须服从国家计划，根据国家的需要逐步走上生产岗位。所以对于初中毕业生、尤其是不及劳动年龄和最大多数的高小毕业生，除了加强劳动教育外，必须有自学的组织以满足他们和社会的要求。此外，上海的初中和高小毕业生去年有二万多人不能升学或就业，今年便要积累达五万多人。我对此问题在一九五三年就已经注意，一九五四年暑假，更曾参加过一些家长会，向高小、初中毕业生讲过话，也曾在报纸上写过文章。但因深入不够，所讲所写都是一般地宣传政策的话多，亲切体会的话少。今年从数字上更知道这问题的重要性，所以决定把它当作重点问题之一，在上海进行视察。
    社会上对于自学的顾虑
    今年六月初，上海举行应届初中毕业生代表会议，我曾参加，并于会议前了解了一些同学及家长们的思想情况。会后视察中等学校，都曾和学生代表座谈，也曾参加过应届毕业生家长会，并和教师们座谈自学问题。就我接触所及，不论教师、学生、家长，对于自学是服从国家计划、支援社会主义建设的大道理都能懂得；但碰到个人的具体问题，很多的人都有顾虑，除去轻视自学的思想问题以外，主要的顾虑是：（一）青少年年纪小，在学校有教师直接督教，现在用广播教学，学生听不听，教师无从知道，学得怎样也无人检查，因而对于自学的成就很难相信。（二）语文及社会科学可能由听广播自学得好，自然科学的学习必须通过直观教学和实验，在广播中师生不见面，当然谈不到直观教学，也没有方法实验，就是学生安心听讲、努力学习，也不能把书本的机械、物理、化学等等知识用制作或实验从实际表现出来，所以对于自然科学的自学大家都无信心。（三）青少年们欢喜活动，身心又正在发育，他们除读书以外，应有文化娱乐活动、体格锻炼，尤其是共产主义道德品质的培养，以完成毛主席“三好”的指示；听广播自学，每日不过两节课的时间，就说语文和自然科学都能学好，其他的体育、德育、美育又怎样进行教育？若果对于这些方面不加配合，不对青少年们进行“全面发展”的教育，纵然能够学好语文和自然科学又有什么用处？这也是最大多数的人所顾虑的。此外如家长工作忙没有时间照顾孩子的学习，或者文化水准低没有能力教育孩子，或者有些流氓分子、不法资本家，常常引诱青少年们走坏路，而家长无法照管纠正等等问题，这里不再细讲了。
    从这次视察和上海市初中高
        小毕业生自学成绩展览会
        中所得到的解答
    这次参加上海市自学小组视察的除我而外，尚有市人民代表九人，共视察初中自学小组十七组，高小自学小组四组，开过家长座谈会两次。我以同时参加视察中学教育及其他工作，只视察初中自学小组两组、高小一组、参加家长座谈会一次，参观自学成绩展览会一次，并参加视察小组小结会一次及教育视察组总结会。这里所讲的解答是结合小结、总结和个人的体会而成的。
    首先说明青少年能否自学。上海市于一九五四年九月组织初中毕业生自学小组一千零三十八组，计一万二千二百零一人，高小六百四十一组，计七千六百三十七人，现在除去参加劳动者外，尚有六百七十八组，计六千六百三十七人。初中自学小组均以听广播自学为主，只在必要时由电台及原校老师和社会上予以帮助指导，高小自学小组则编成中队一百五十八个，有专职总辅导员三人，非专职中队辅导员四百四十人（主要是初中毕业同学）。就我们视察及了解所及，这许多自学小组，基本上都能坚持学习，而且有成绩、有信心。从展览会的一千二百多件成绩展品中，可以看出不论是初中或高小毕业同学，也不论是那一科目，以至于身体发育、体格锻炼、道德品质，都有一定的成就。这就说明初中和高小毕业同学在有领导、有组织的条件之下是可以自学的。其次是自然科学能否通过自学而取得一定的成就，在这次的视察和展览会中也得到了明确的答复。我们在视察时，初中、高小自学的同学们告诉我们是怎样用废铁、废料做各种模型的；在展览会中，我们看见的有关机械、物理、化学的模型和实验比我们所听到的要多过几十倍。最使我们注意的是一个山谷水库和水力发电设备的模型；这是北四川路区海鸥自学小组的成绩。最初他们听物理课关于电灯串联、并联的问题想作模型来实验，有位同学想到过去在物理学上已学过水轮机和水力发电设备，建议把它们合起来做成一个大模型，于是大家在一块小黑板上堆起了山谷和河床，在山谷里筑起了一个蓄水库，引自来水从水库里冲下来，推动了水轮，带动了发电机，发出来的电力能使山谷里的几十个小电灯（手电筒用的电珠）一齐发光，而显示一幅壮丽的水力发电的夜景图。他们并能当着观众的面作电解水、电解食盐水溶液、镀铜、用过锰酸钾加热得氧气、用二氧化炭灭火等等实验并详细加以说明。此外还陈列了大批电动机模型，每一架电动机通上电流就能转动起来，无线电收音机能使大家收听等等，都有力地解答了一般人对于自然科学不能自学的疑问。第三、同学们告诉我们，他们经常有组织地开展文化娱乐和体育活动：平时有合唱队、朗诵会、音乐队、舞蹈队、文艺阅读报告会、篮球队、体格锻炼班、戏剧演出队；在春假时并组织春游队到近郊游览，也曾分区开过运动会，组织过文艺会演。他们也经常参加里弄工作、公益劳动。中山公园文化馆举办“一定要解放台湾展览会”，江宁区“五四”小组的同学为之担任讲解，最大多数的自学小组的同学都担任里弄识字班的教师——长宁区“四·一一”自学小组十人中有九人参加文教工作。他们在一年的时间内，有七千九百多人参加了生产劳动，其中去西北的就有一千多人，每一个人的来信都是欢欣鼓舞，愿为西北的建设贡献出一切力量。在展览会中，我们看到“四·一
  一”自学小组的图书馆；各自学小组中的刺绣、机绣的各种家庭用品，高尔基的大幅油画像和各种国画、粉画、素描，有合唱队、话剧演出、操场活动的各种照片；有北四川路吴运铎小组同学平均增加体重近十磅的纪录表；有内容丰富的墙报；有花了半年时间经过三次修改而成的独幕剧“将开放的花朵”；有继续不断的自学日记。从以上的事实，说明了初中、高小毕业同学自学的生活是怎样丰富、愉快，健康和发育是怎样正常，共产主义的道德品质是怎样在提高。
      自学成就的关键
    上面所说的种种事实只是好的一面，这成就并不是每个小组都是如此，也有一些小组的成就不多，甚至并无成就的。我们不能只看到成就的一面，更不能夸大成就、忽视困难。这些成就是有条件的。就我们视察及参观展览发现有下面的一些条件。
      （一）有组织、有领导、有计划：去年暑假由青年团上海市委和教育局、民主青年联合会、民主妇联及区民政部门共同组织初中、高小毕业生，依毕业生的学校或地区为单位分成自学小组，每组十多人，初中选组长、高小派辅导员领导学习；由教育局选派中小学优良教师及总辅导员担任自学辅导广播讲座的教学及辅导。每日对初中高小自学同学各播讲两节课；教材则由教育局请科学普及协会协助编辑；团区委和民主青年联合会领导各种活动和品德培养；妇联及区民政部门对自学小组的场所、收音机等给予具体地协助。
    （二）社会的关怀和支援：这次的展览会分成三大部分，第一部分的总题目是“社会关怀”。在这“社会关怀”大幅标题之下，首先映入我们眼睛的是中共中央办公厅秘书室写给上海自学同学的信。信上说：“写给毛主席的信收到了。你们努力自学，积极地参加社会工作，提高了政治和文化水平，并加强了劳动观点，这是很好的。希望你们继续努力，为今后从事劳动生产，作好准备。”站在信的旁边的一位担任讲解员的自学同学，用极兴奋的口吻告诉我们：他们接到这封信的时候是怎样地高兴，和它怎样鼓舞了他们的努力学习。此外，在墙壁上还挂着大批信件：有的来自朝鲜前线的志愿军和守卫在海防前线的解放军部队，有的来自西安的建筑工地，有的是远在青海、新疆参加祖国建设而过去是自学的同学寄来的。这些信鼓励他们学习，也有劝导他们千万不要骄傲，并且有询问他们有什么困难，要尽力协助解决的。从这些信中可以看见社会各方面对自学同学的关怀。在这些书信的下面是展品台：台上陈列着许多礼物：有铜鼓、铜号、手风琴、胡琴、各种球类、棋类、球拍、书籍、抄本等等，是家长、里弄及参加劳动的同学们送给他们的。我们更从视察所见和讲解员所讲，知道很多家长和居民委员会及学校在很困难的条件下，为自学小组腾房间、借房间、借收音机、借报纸、借书籍，还有为他们补习功课的。有的工厂开放厂内场地，欢迎自学同学去锻炼，体育场、公园经常为他们免费开放，图书馆为他们举行文艺报告会，科学普及协会为他们举行通俗科学讲演会，专家们为他们举行自学讲座，技术工人帮助他们找废料、制车床和收音机，华东师范大学的同学们帮助他们制“接触法制硫酸”的模型。总之，从视察和展览会中，我们感觉到从毛主席以下，好像都结合成为一个整体而关怀着、支援着初中、高小毕业同学们的自学。
      （三）同学们的主动努力：展览会的第二个大标题是“克服困难”。自学同学的困难是很多的：第一是旧社会思想给予他们的影响。这是说：“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”的思想残余尚支配着许多人、也影响着自学同学对于自学的看法。第二是经济问题的阻碍：年龄较大而家境又比较困难的同学，因为生活上需要就业而一时不能被分配参加生产劳动，自学同他实际要求矛盾，所以也难安心。第三是学习习惯的阻碍：在学校有教师直接指导，有同学集体活动，现在改为广播教学，在学习上既感到不习惯，在生活上也感到有些孤独——年轻的同学尤甚，所以听广播往往听不下去，若果开始不细心收听、及时复习，以后更难赶上，终至于不能再听：有些小组不能继续下去，就是这个原因。第四是实习、实验有困难：听广播很用心，但有问题不能如在学校一般可以随时请老师指教，作练习或作文也不能随时得到教师批改，理化科的实验更不能如在学校一样有充足的仪器、实验材料、实验室，所以学习需要更多的努力。以上各种困难阻碍了一些自学小组不能继续下去、或者不能继续进步，也考验了许多小组，使他们继续不断地进步，从艰苦学习中牢固地掌握了知识，从社会工作中训练了工作能力，提高了道德品质。这种克服困难的事例在视察和展览会中看到了很多。
      问题和建议
    上海近一年来组织初中和高小毕业生自学，已经获得很大的成绩。但因为这是一种新事业，并无前例可援，同时这事业不只是有关上海地区而且有关全国，不只是今天而且是相当长期的问题。所以我们绝不能满足于现有的成绩，更要在现有的基础上力求改进。因此根据视察所发现的一些问题，在这里作一些初步的建议。
    我们所看到的问题，第一是领导分散：前面曾经说过教育局、团区委、妇联、民政机构、劳动机构等对自学都有领导，但因联系不够，各方面对彼此的工作不甚了解，因而有脱节之处，如劳动部门分派自学同学参加劳动生产，往往不向领导自学的机构深入了解，只凭学校的旧资料作标准，以致有人被分派三次不愿去，第四次仍被派到，而有些年龄大、家境差、自学好的青年也有从未被分派的。我们视察所及的小组，每组都提出这个同样的问题并表示不满。其他互不联系的事也经常发生。所以我们建议由各领导部门，组织统一领导机构，依据国家政策、结合当地情况，共同商定具体计划，不论是组织同学的自学，是广播教师、辅导员的选派，教材的编制，文化娱乐、体育活动的布置，社会工作、公益劳动的参加，社会力量的发动，各种讲座的举办，参加生产劳动的调派等等均由这机构统一安排，使自学能更有计划而平衡地发展。第二是自学方针不明确：对初中、高小毕业生的自学目的，大家尚缺乏一致的看法，因而广播教材的内容前一些时期偏重工业上的机械方面，后一些时期又改为温习旧课和准备劳动并重。此外，有一部分一九五三年由初中和高小毕业的同学，同一九五四年毕业的同学同时自学，今年下半年，并可能有一九五三至一九五五年毕业的同学同时自学，绝不能再照一九五四年的旧办法一同办理。所以我们建议在教材内容上，应当按照既定的方针来确定，即：对高小和初中毕业生应当是巩固已有知识，并在原有基础上继续提高，为他们将来升学或是参加生产劳动作好准备。今年广播教学对去年毕业的初中、高小同学最好另开较高的班次，以免他们重复学习。我们以为初中、高小毕业生的自学应同国家建设计划联系起来，是一种比较长时期的工作，因而建议各地区政府机关和社会团体、对于初中、高小毕业生之未能升学或参加劳动者，一律组织自学。第三是广播教学虽有它的优点和成绩，但同时有它的限制。在展览会中所表现的自然科学和语文、绘画等成绩，除由于同学们的努力而外，教师、工人、家长们给予他们的直接帮助，都应当看作能有成绩的因素之一；因此我建议各校理科实验室及各区理科实验站，各体育场所、各普通图书馆应根据各处具体情况，设立专职实验、体育、图书指导员，指导自学同学的理科实验、体育锻炼、图书阅读，并发动工厂组织自学同学参观、见习，使同学于广播教学外，同时能得到导师的直接指导，并能得到工厂的实际知识。此外更可由各指导机构在自学的统一机构领导之下组织各种讲座，以丰富同学们的学习生活。
    以上是我们自学视察小组和我个人对于自学所发现的一些问题和建议。
      结　论
    我们视察上海初中、高小毕业生的自学小组以后，深深认识了人民民主制度的优越性：一年来上海自学的成绩首先是由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导。在具体工作上虽然还有缺点，但青年被组织起来了，并得到了各方面的关怀和支援。青年们不独学业有成就，品德有进步，政治水平有了提高。我们视察所到的初中自学小组，无例外地要求听关于胡风事件的报告，无例外地对胡风反革命集团表示强烈的阶级仇恨。当我在蓬莱区和李大钊自学小组座谈，青年们要求我此次出席全国人民代表大会会议，必须请全国人民代表大会常务委员会先取消胡风的代表资格。他们在学习时能克服一切困难。在展览会讲解时，每人都说：“我们有信心、有前途；我们的前途是包含在祖国的光辉前途之中的。”从他们的勇敢、自信、快乐、活泼和热爱祖国、仇恨敌人、热爱劳动、不怕困难的形象中，我们看到了祖国的光辉前途。我们有责任为培育青年一代、为建设祖国成为伟大的社会主义的国家而贡献出我们的一切力量！
