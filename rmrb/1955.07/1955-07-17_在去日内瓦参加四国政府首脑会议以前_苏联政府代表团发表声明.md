Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 16th, TASS Dispatch: The Soviet government delegation, preparing to depart for Geneva to attend the Four-Power Summit, held a press conference at the Kremlin on July 15th. Many Soviet and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

N.A. Bulganin, head of the Soviet delegation, issued a statement to reporters before the Soviet government delegation departed for Geneva.

N.S. Khrushchev, V.M. Molotov, G.K. Zhukov, and A.A. Gromyko participated in the press conference.

The full text of the Soviet delegation's statement is as follows:

Statement by the Soviet Government Delegation to Reporters Before Departing for Geneva

The Soviet government delegation is traveling to Geneva to frankly discuss extremely important international issues with other major powers, to seek common ground, and to work together to ease international tensions and strengthen trust in relations between countries.

The most ardent desire of people of all countries is the desire for peace. This is understandable. The First and Second World Wars inflicted incalculable sacrifices on mankind. Currently, the "Cold War" policy, huge military budgets, and the arms race impose heavy burdens on the masses and cause panic and fear for the future. People can only breathe freely when they are confident in their future, deeply knowing that they and their children will not suffer the terrible disaster of war, and they can live and work in peace.

In the West, there is often talk of so-called dangers from the Soviet Union. Under this pretext, military blocs are cobbled together and military bases are built around our country. We have never intended to invade anyone, and doing so would be contrary to our principles and our consistent peace policy. However, since we see the war preparations of other countries, we cannot but take measures to safeguard our own security. We have an army, and in our opinion a very good army, equipped with all the necessary equipment. However, we have never wanted war and believe that our sacred duty is to do our best to eliminate the current international tensions and replace them with an atmosphere of trust, mutual understanding, and cooperation in business. This will allow countries to use the large sums of money currently spent on armaments to increase the well-being of the people of all countries—building houses, schools, factories, power stations, and developing science and culture.

If a European collective security system can be established, which other countries can also join, that would be a great victory for the cause of peace. We are convinced that this is achievable: the people of European countries can live in peace and friendship, without fear of each other.

Sometimes it is said that differences in the social and state systems of these or those countries hinder the peaceful resolution of international disputes. However, social and state systems are internal matters for the people of each country. Many things in our way of life may be disliked by some foreigners, just as many of their things may be disliked by us. But why should differences in social and state systems hinder the peaceful coexistence of countries, hinder mutual respect, and the development of mutually beneficial trade and cultural ties?

Some believe that capitalism is superior to socialism. We believe the opposite. This debate cannot be resolved by war with force. Let everyone prove their correctness in a peaceful economic competition.

There are many outstanding disputes in the world today. There will be more in the future. That is life. But we can and should patiently and sincerely discuss these issues at the round table and seek peaceful solutions. As the saying goes, even a bad peace is better than a good quarrel. If we make every effort and strive for not a bad, but a good, genuine peace, then millions of people in all countries will be able to breathe a sigh of relief. They will be free from the fear of another war threat and will be able to live and work in peace and with confidence, and this peace and confidence will firmly become the long-term destiny of not only our generation, but also the next.

It is with this purpose in mind that we are going to Geneva.

It would be naive to think that we can solve every complex international problem at this meeting. However, if all participants in the meeting can show sincerity and genuinely dedicate themselves to reaching an agreement, we will undoubtedly find common ground and formulate practical ways to effectively solve extremely important issues related to peace and the well-being of the people of all countries.

Undoubtedly, achieving these lofty goals facing the meeting requires great effort. The Soviet delegation declares that the Soviet delegation will make such efforts. We hope that the other participants in the meeting will do the same.

    在去日内瓦参加四国政府首脑会议以前
    苏联政府代表团发表声明
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：准备启程前往日内瓦参加四国政府首脑会议的苏联政府代表团七月十五日在克里姆林宫举行记者招待会。出席记者招待会的有苏联和外国报纸的许多记者。
    苏联代表团团长尼·亚·布尔加宁在苏联政府代表团启程前往日内瓦以前向记者发表了一篇声明。
    参加记者招待会的有尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、维·米·莫洛托夫、格·康·朱可夫和安·安·葛罗米柯。
    苏联代表团的声明全文如下：
    苏联政府代表团在启程前往日内瓦以前向记者发表的声明
    苏联政府代表团前往日内瓦，是为了要开诚布公地同其他大国商讨极其重要的国际问题，寻找共同的基础，共同努力求得缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国关系中的信任。
    各国人民最强烈的愿望是和平的愿望。这是可以理解的。第一次和第二次世界大战使人类蒙受难以估计的牺牲。目前，“冷战”政策，庞大的军事预算和军备竞赛加给人民群众沉重的负担，引起惊慌和对前途的恐惧。人们只有在他们对明天满怀信心，并且深知他们和他们的孩子不致遭受可怕的战争灾祸的威胁，他们能安居乐业的时候，才能畅快地呼吸。
    在西方常常有人说到所谓来自苏联方面的危险。有人就在这种借口下拼凑军事集团，在我国周围建立军事基地。我们过去和现在从来不打算侵犯任何人，因为这样做是同我们的原则和我们始终不变的和平政策违背的。但是，我们既然看到其他国家的战争准备，当然不能不采取措施，来保障我国的安全。我们有一支军队，并且在我们看来是非常好的军队，它配备有一切必要的装备。不过，我们过去和现在都不希望战争，并且认为我们的神圣责任是，尽力消除目前的国际紧张局势而代之以信任、相互谅解和在事务上合作的气氛。这将使得各国可以把目前耗费在军备上的大批资金用来增进各国人民的幸福——建设住宅、学校、工厂、发电站和发展科学和文化。
    如果能建立其他国家也可以参加的欧洲集体安全体系，那将是和平事业的一个巨大胜利。我们深信，这是可以实现的事情：欧洲各国人民能够在和平和友好中生活，彼此不存有戒惧的心理。
    有时可以听到这种说法：这些或那些国家的社会制度和国家制度的不同阻碍了国际争执问题的和平解决。然而，社会制度和国家制度是各国人民内部的事情。我们的生活方式中许多事物可能是某些外国人士所不喜欢的，正如他们的许多事物可能为我们所不喜欢一样。但是，为什么社会制度和国家制度的不同会阻碍各国人民和平地相处，阻碍相互尊重和发展互利的贸易和文化联系呢？
    有人认为，资本主义优于社会主义。而我们则认为恰恰相反。这种争论不能靠战争用武力来解决的。让大家各自在和平的经济竞赛中证明自己的正确吧。
    现在世界上有许多悬而未决的争执问题。今后也是会有的。生活就是这样。但是，这些问题我们能够，而且应当耐心地和诚意地在圆桌会议上加以讨论，求得和平的解决。俗话说得好，甚至坏的和平也胜于好的吵架。假使我们尽一切努力，并且争取到不是坏的、而是好的、真正的和平，那么各国千百万人们将可以松一口气。他们将可以免去对另一次战争威胁的恐惧，能够安宁地、有信心地生活和劳动，而这种安宁和信心将牢靠地成为不仅是我们这代的，而且也是下代长远的命运。
    正是抱着这个目的，我们才到日内瓦去。
    如果认为在这次会议上我们能够解决所有复杂的国际问题，那就太天真了。但是，如果所有参加会议的人都能表现诚意，真诚地致力于达成协议，毫无疑问，我们会找到共同的基础，拟订出切实可行的办法来有效地解决关系着和平和各国人民的幸福的极其重要的问题。
    毫无疑问，要达到会议所面临的这些崇高的目的，需要作巨大的努力。苏联代表团声明：苏联代表团这一方面将作这样的努力。我们希望，会议的其他参加者也会这样做。
