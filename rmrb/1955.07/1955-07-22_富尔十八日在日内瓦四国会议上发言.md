Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 19th. French Premier Four spoke at the first session of the Four-Power Conference on the morning of the 18th, saying that the two main goals in the world today are to end the Cold War and establish peace and peaceful cooperation among all countries in the world.

He said that one of the main factors of tension is that some obstacles prevent the free exchange of goods, ideas, and news between countries around the world. The heads of the four governments should strive to make principled decisions on establishing or restoring freedom of exchange, and then let experts work out the details of implementation.

Speaking on the German question, Four said that the division of Germany is an obstacle to achieving reconciliation. He said that if the German question is not resolved, then even if the world situation improves in other respects, "it will be impossible to achieve true harmony in international life." He emphasized that Germany must be reunified.

Four believes that Eden's plan on the German question is reasonable, but details can be changed.

Four opposes the neutralization of Germany. He said: "I believe that a reunified Germany should exist within the framework of Western Europe and the Atlantic Treaty system. I believe that this proposition is the best both legally and factually."

However, Four also said: The discussion of the German question should be based on security issues. He said that the overall potential of a reunified Germany as a nation will inevitably increase, and the question is to find ways to reduce or eradicate this supposedly generated danger.

Four then put forward suggestions on the German question: First, the total troops possessed by the whole of Germany after reunification should not exceed the troops possessed by West Germany as a member of the Western European Union. Second, West Germany should also give assurances to the Soviet Union that it will not use force to achieve German unification or modify the current borders. Third, include a unified Germany in a universal security system. This security system can be extended to all European countries that agree to participate.

In his speech, Four also outlined his disarmament plan and suggested establishing an international organization to handle the funds obtained from disarmament. He said that these funds could be used to help and equip backward areas.

Four emphasized that France is willing to work together to find ways to control atomic weapons.

    富尔十八日在日内瓦四国会议上发言
    新华社日内瓦十九日电　法国总理富尔十八日上午在四大国会议第一次会议上发言，他说，今天世界上的两个主要目标是结束冷战，建立和平及世界各国之间的和平合作。
    他说，紧张局势的主要因素之一是有些障碍使世界各国之间不能自由交流货物、思想和消息。四国政府首脑应努力作出关于建立或恢复交流自由的原则决定，然后让专家们拟订实施的细节。
    富尔在谈到德国问题时说，德国的分裂是一个阻止获得和解的障碍。他说，德国问题不解决，那么即便世界局势在别的方面有所改善，“国际生活也是不可能取得真正的和谐的”。他强调德国必须重新统一。
    富尔认为艾登关于德国问题的计划是合理的，但是细节可以加以改变。
    富尔反对德国的中立化。他说：“我是认为一个重新统一的德国应当生存在西欧和大西洋公约体系之内的。我认为，这个主张在法律上和事实上都是最好的。”
    但是，富尔又说：德国问题的讨论应当以安全问题作根据。他说，重新统一的德国作为一个国家，它的总的潜力不可避免地将会增加，问题是想法来减少或根绝这种据称将会产生的危险。
    富尔接着就德国问题提出建议：一、整个德国在重新统一后所拥有的部队不应超过作为西欧联盟一员的西德所拥有的部队。二、西德应该也向苏联提出保证：它不使用武力来获得德国的统一或修改目前的边界。三、把一个统一的德国包括在一个普遍的安全体系之中。这个安全体系可以扩大到所有将同意参加的欧洲国家。
    富尔在他的发言中还概述了他的裁军计划并且建议设立一个国际组织来处理由于裁军而得到的款项。他说，这些款项可以用来帮助和装备落后地区。
    富尔强调法国愿意共同设法找出管制原子武器的办法。
