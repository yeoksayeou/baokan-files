Heighten Vigilance, Strengthen National Defense, Safeguard Socialist Construction
National People's Congress Representative Fu Zhong

The Second Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is discussing and will adopt the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, which is a decisive program for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people of the whole country in striving to realize the general task of the state's transition period. In recent years, the people of our country have been working tirelessly with unprecedented labor enthusiasm to realize this program and to build socialism. However, it is not easy to carry out socialist construction in such a large and economically backward country as ours. To realize the country's socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country must work diligently and engage in long-term arduous labor, and must wage resolute struggles against all kinds of enemies and all kinds of difficulties. We need time, we need peace. Without a long-term peaceful environment, it is impossible to build our country into a great socialist country.

However, peace cannot be guaranteed solely by our own wishes. The current international conditions are favorable to our socialist construction. The close unity and increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the rising voices of the people of the world against wars of aggression, in favor of peace, and advocating peaceful coexistence, are making the international situation increasingly conducive to development in the direction of peace. However, the road to maintaining peace is not straight and smooth and without obstacles. The aggressive camp headed by US imperialism is actually doing its utmost to prevent the further relaxation of the international situation and is continuing to prepare for new wars. Therefore, a sharp and complex struggle is currently taking place between the forces of war and the forces of peace. From an international perspective, the imperialist aggressive forces are surrounding us. Our territory of Taiwan is still occupied by US imperialism, and the United States wants to use Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina as "springboards" to wage war against China from these three fronts. US imperialism is even attempting to link its military aggression bases in Asia with its military aggression bases in Europe through its Middle East and Near East alliances, forming an encirclement of the entire peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp. The strength of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp is strong, and we have never feared and will never fear imperialist war provocations; however, we must never be complacent, underestimate the danger of war, or underestimate the strength of the enemy. If imperialism wants to launch a war, it is very likely to carry out a surprise attack. On the one hand, we must unswervingly implement a peaceful foreign policy, strive for peaceful coexistence, and strive to ease international tensions. On the other hand, we should strive to liberate Taiwan and conscientiously prepare fully in accordance with the saying "be prepared for unforeseen circumstances" to deal with any possible sudden incidents.

Domestically, counter-revolutionary elements are also doing everything possible to carry out sabotage activities. In the current stage of the socialist revolution, the class struggle has not eased, but has become more complex and acute. The cause of building socialism is a serious class struggle. As the Communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP pointed out: "In this struggle, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never stand idly by; on the other hand, the domestic classes that have been overthrown will never be reconciled to their own demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionary elements among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism and use every opportunity to undermine the cause of our Party and the people, attempting to cause the failure of the Chinese revolution and restore reactionary rule in China." In the face of this situation, we must not have any侥幸 (a sense of僥倖 refers to a lucky chance of escape) mentality or麻痹 (apathy) emotions. The Hu Feng incident has given us an extremely profound lesson; the tiger is right beside us, and we must never be negligent and 麻痹 again. Some people find it easy to be vigilant against enemies lurking outside the gate, but they are not good at identifying and fighting against enemies who use two-faced tactics to hide inside us to carry out sabotage, which is particularly dangerous!

It is quite obvious that in such a serious and complex struggle environment at home and abroad, we must not relax our vigilance, but must consolidate and strengthen our national defense construction in order to prevent imperialist aggression from the outside and suppress the sabotage activities of all counter-revolutionary elements from the inside. Only in this way can we guarantee the safety of our country's socialist construction.

At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao solemnly declared: "Our national defense will be consolidated, and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again. On the basis of the heroic and tested People's Liberation Army, our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed. We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." The people of the whole country should keep Chairman Mao's instructions firmly in mind and clearly understand that in the situation of imperialist encirclement and the intensification of domestic class struggle, we must consolidate and strengthen our national defense forces in order to have the victory of socialist construction.

However, after the realization of the Korean War armistice and our country's transition to large-scale economic construction, some people have emerged who believe that the world is now at peace and that only engaging in economic construction is the only important thing in the future. They neglect the importance of strengthening national defense construction at the same time during the socialist construction period. This is all due to a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the current international and domestic situation and a lack of a high degree of vigilance against enemies at home and abroad.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army bears direct responsibility for defending the motherland and the people. Therefore, the army must maintain full vigilance against enemies at home and abroad at all times and in all places, otherwise there is a danger that the safety of the country and the people will be seriously damaged. For example, as long as a special agent mixes into our army, he can steal our military secrets, and at any time and anywhere there is the possibility of using our weapons to beat our people. For example, in the ranks of our coastal defense and border defense front lines, if a unit or even a sentry is slightly negligent in guarding against the enemy, there is also the danger of being attacked by the enemy. But do our comrades in the army all clearly understand the serious significance of maintaining vigilance? This is something that every soldier of ours should pay special attention to checking. In fact, the army's vigilance still needs to be greatly improved. For example, some comrades have a one-sided estimate of the current situation, believing that the strength of the current peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp has exceeded the aggressive forces, so imperialism will never dare to launch a war of aggression in the future. This is a manifestation of the idea of ​​peace 麻痹. In order to enable our army to continue to better fulfill the sacred task of defending the motherland and defending peace, political education must be further strengthened within the army, and attention must be paid to improving the vigilance of the troops at all times, and a resolute struggle must be waged against the idea of ​​peace 麻痹.

However, raising vigilance must not remain on the verbal level. It must be implemented in the daily work of the army and in the actual actions of every soldier. To this end, the political organs at all levels of the troops must further strengthen the leadership, organization and implementation of current affairs education in the troops, and often pay attention to educating the troops with examples of the war conspiracies and sabotage activities of enemies at home and abroad, so that every soldier has a deep understanding of the long-term, sharp, and complex struggle between the world's peace forces and imperialist war forces in the future, and eliminates the roots of the idea of ​​peace 麻痹 from the ideological level. At the same time, in terms of organization, we must attach great importance to the purity of the internal political quality of the army. Whether it is combat troops, organs, or schools, we must earnestly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from mixing in and resolutely eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements who have mixed in to ensure the purity of the army. Every soldier of ours must care about the international situation at all times and in all places, care about the construction and safety of the motherland, and must be ideologically and practically prepared to cope with sudden incidents at all times. Our soldiers must deeply understand the urgent significance of accelerating the modernization and regularization of our army. In military training, we must overcome all difficulties and not let go of every minute and second to earnestly study the advanced Soviet military science, rapidly improve our military technology and tactical level, and skillfully use our increasingly improved weapons and equipment, so that we can more confidently give a devastating blow to enemies who dare to invade us at any time.

At present, the implementation of our country's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has entered its third year. With the progress of our country's economic construction, our country's national defense strength is also being strengthened day by day. But we must never be proud and complacent and become 麻痹. The American aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea that seriously threatened our country's security not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and at the same time, it still stubbornly occupies our country's territory of Taiwan. These facts alone are enough to powerfully prove that the enemy will never let us carry out construction smoothly. Therefore, the people of our whole country must increase their vigilance a hundredfold and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan, for the completion of our country's socialist construction, and for the defense of this construction. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the support and assistance of the people, our People's Liberation Army has won the victories of previous revolutionary wars in extremely difficult and difficult environments. Now, the people of the whole country are giving the People's Liberation Army with the greatest efforts and giving us very good weapons and equipment. We must guarantee that we will never fail the love and trust of the people of the whole country. We must liberate our country's territory of Taiwan, and we must faithfully fulfill our soldiers' duties to make national defense more consolidated.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country will be able to unite more closely, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan. The formulation of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China is of great significance for consolidating national defense. It is only natural that the people of the whole country unanimously expressed their warm support when discussing the draft of the Military Service Law. As long as the people of our whole country are of one heart, the army and the people are of one heart, our country's socialist construction will surely succeed, and the imperialists' conspiracies and sabotage will surely fail.

### 提高警惕，加强国防，保卫社会主义建设

    提高警惕，加强国防，保卫社会主义建设
    全国人民代表大会代表　傅锺
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，正在讨论并将通过发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，这个计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现国家过渡时期总任务而奋斗的一个有决定意义的纲领。近几年来，我国人民正以空前的劳动热情为着实现这个纲领，为着社会主义的建设而奋斗不懈。但是在我们这样大的一个经济落后的国家进行社会主义建设是不很容易的，要实现国家的社会主义工业化，必须全国人民兢兢业业，从事长期的艰苦劳动，必须向各种各样的敌人和各种各样的困难进行坚决的斗争。我们需要时间，我们需要和平，没有一个长期的和平的环境，是不可能把我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的。
    可是，单凭我们自己的愿望，并不能取得和平的保证。目前的国际条件对我国的社会主义建设是有利的，以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的紧密团结和日益强大，世界人民反对侵略战争，拥护和平，主张和平共处的呼声愈来愈高，声势愈来愈大，使国际局势日益有利于向和平方向发展。但是，维护和平的道路，并不是笔直平坦而毫无阻拦的，以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，实际上正竭力阻止国际局势的进一步缓和，继续进行新战争的准备。因此当前战争势力同和平力量之间正进行着尖锐而复杂的斗争。从国际环境来看，帝国主义侵略势力正在包围我们，我国的领土台湾还被美帝国主义所侵占，美国要利用朝鲜、台湾和印度支那作为“跳板”，从这样三条战线上来对中国作战。美帝国主义甚至还企图通过它的中东、近东的同盟，把它在亚洲的军事侵略基地和它在欧洲的军事侵略基地联结起来，形成对整个和平民主社会主义阵营的包围。和平民主社会主义阵营的力量是强大的，我们从来不怕、也永远不怕帝国主义的战争挑衅；可是，我们绝不能因此而麻痹大意，低估战争的危险，轻视敌人的力量。帝国主义要发动战争，很可能是进行突然的袭击。我们必须一方面坚持不懈地执行和平外交政策，争取和平共处，力求缓和国际紧张局势，一方面应努力解放台湾，并认真按照
  “有备无患”这句名言来充分准备，随时应付可能发生的突然事变。
    在国内，同样有反革命分子千方百计地进行破坏活动。在当前社会主义革命阶段，阶级斗争不但没有缓和，反而更加复杂，更加尖锐了。建设社会主义的事业是一场严重的阶级斗争。正如中共七届四中全会公报所指出的：“在这场斗争中，一方面，外国帝国主义决不会袖手旁观；另一方面，国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义互相勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。”面对这种形势，我们决不能够存有丝毫侥幸心理和麻痹情绪。胡风事件，已经给了我们极其深刻的教训；老虎就在身边，我们决不能再轻敌麻痹了。有些人，对在大门外边虎视眈眈的敌人提高警惕是容易做到的，而对于采用两面手法暗藏在我们内部进行破坏的敌人则不善于辨别，更不善于斗争，这是特别危险的！
    十分明显，在国外国内这样严重复杂的斗争环境中，我们决不能放松警惕，必须巩固和加强我们的国防建设，以便对外防备帝国主义的侵略，对内镇压一切反革命分子的破坏活动。只有如此，才能保证我国社会主义建设的安全。
    当中华人民共和国成立之初，毛主席就严肃地宣告：“我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。在英勇的经过了考验的人民解放军的基础上，我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”全国人民都应牢记着毛主席的这个指示，清楚认识，在帝国主义包围和国内阶级斗争尖锐化的形势下，必须巩固和加强国防力量，才能有社会主义建设的胜利。
    但是，在朝鲜停战实现，我国转入大规模的经济建设以后，却出现了这样一些人：他们以为天下从此太平了，今后只有从事经济建设，才是唯一重要的事情。而对于在社会主义建设时期，同时又必须加强国防建设的重要性则有所忽视，这都是由于对目前国际国内形势缺乏全面的认识，对国外国内的敌人缺乏高度的警惕性的缘故。
    中国人民解放军对保卫祖国和人民负有直接的责任，所以军队对国外国内的敌人，必须随时随地保持充分的警惕，否则就有使国家和人民的安全遭受严重损害的危险。比如，在我们军队里，只要混进一个特务，他就可以盗窃我们的军事机密，随时随地有拿我们的武器打我们的人的可能。又如在我们海防和边防前线的队伍里，如果有一支部队或甚至有一个哨兵对敌人的警戒稍为麻痹大意一下，也有被敌人偷袭的危险。但是我们军队同志对保持警惕的严重意义是不是都认识得很清楚了呢？这是特别值得我们每个军人来检查的事情。实际上，军队的警惕性还需大大的提高。比如，有些同志对目前形势片面的估计，认为目前和平民主社会主义阵营的力量已经超过了侵略势力，所以帝国主义今后决不敢发动侵略战争了。这就是和平麻痹思想的表现。为了使我们军队继续更好地执行保卫祖国、保卫和平的神圣任务，在军队内部必须进一步加强政治教育，时刻注意提高部队的警惕性，同和平麻痹的思想作坚决的斗争。
    但提高警惕性，决不能停留在口头上。它必须在军队的日常工作和每个军人的实际行动中得到贯彻。为此，部队的各级政治机关必须进一步加强部队的时事教育的领导和组织实施，经常注意以国外国内敌人的战争阴谋、破坏活动等实例来教育部队，务使每个军人，对今后世界和平力量同帝国主义战争势力之间的长期的尖锐的复杂的斗争有深刻的认识，从认识上消除产生和平麻痹思想的根源。同时在组织上，必须十分重视军队内部政治质量的纯洁，无论是战斗部队、机关、学校，均必须认真地防止反革命分子的混入，和坚决肃清已混入的反革命分子，保证军队内部的纯洁。我们每个军人必须随时随地关心国际形势，关心祖国的建设和安全，要时时刻刻都有应付突然事变的思想准备和行动准备。我们军人必须深刻认识加速我军现代化、正规化建设的迫切意义，在军事训练中，必须克服一切困难，不放松一分一秒的时间来认真地学习苏联先进的军事科学，迅速地提高自己的军事技术和战术水平，熟练地运用我们日益改善的武器装备，以便更有把握地在任何时候，给敢于侵犯我们的敌人以毁灭性的打击。
    目前我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的实施已进入第三年，随着我国经济建设的进展，我国的国防力量也正在日益加强。但我们决不能因此骄傲自满而麻痹起来。美国侵略者在中华人民共和国成立不久，就发动了严重威胁我国安全的侵朝战争，同时它至今还蛮横地侵占着我国的领土台湾，仅仅这些事实，已足够有力地证明：敌人是决不会让我们顺利地进行建设的。因此，我们全国人民必须百倍地提高警惕，坚决为解放台湾而斗争，为完成我国社会主义建设和保卫这一建设而斗争。我们人民解放军在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在人民的拥护和支援下，过去在极端艰苦和困难的环境中，取得了历次革命战争的胜利。现在，全国人民以最大的努力，给人民解放军以无微不至的关怀，并给了我们很好的武器装备。我们一定保证，我们决不辜负全国人民对我们的热爱和付托，我们一定要解放我国的领土台湾，一定要忠诚地履行我们军人的职责，使国防更加巩固。
    我们坚决地相信：全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，必能更加紧密地团结起来，戒骄戒躁，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而斗争。中华人民共和国兵役法的制定，这对于巩固国防具有重大的意义，全国人民在讨论兵役法草案时，一致表示热烈拥护是很自然的。只要我们全国人民一心，军民一心，我国的社会主义建设一定成功，帝国主义的阴谋破坏一定失败。
