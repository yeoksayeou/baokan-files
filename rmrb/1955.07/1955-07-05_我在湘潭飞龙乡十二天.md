　　Twelve Days in Feilong Township, Xiangtan
　　National People's Congress Representative Yi Lirong
    I stayed in Feilong Township, Fifth District of Xiangtan, for twelve days. Because time was limited for me, the inspection was not very thorough and detailed.

    Now, I would like to write down some opinions based on the inspiration I gained from this trip to the countryside, or rather, on my little understanding of rural work.

    The Issue of Cadre Style
    In recent years, many people who care about rural work and want to do it better can't help but worry about the issue of cadre style from time to time. I myself am the same, believing that if cadres have a bad work style and make various mistakes, it will affect the effectiveness of rural work and make the peasant masses dissatisfied with the Party and the government (of course, there are also many people who say that the cadres are good in all aspects).

    Due to the observations I made during this trip to the countryside, my view on this issue is fundamentally different from what I had previously thought and heard. Now, I will briefly explain it item by item as follows:

    (1) Cadres do make mistakes, and some mistakes are even very serious. For example, I heard that a probationary Party member who served as the director of the township credit cooperative and also as a head of a section actually committed the following three errors: First, he embezzled more than 180 yuan of public funds; second, sometimes when people were dissatisfied with him, he would say to that person: You should know that the Communist Party believes in Party members, and I am a Party member. Even if you dare to accuse me, it will definitely be ineffective; third, there was a half-blind old widower who could have received some relief funds from the government this spring, but because he usually spoke frankly to him, he withheld it from him. The mistakes this person committed were very serious, but before I arrived in the township, he had already been expelled from the Party and removed from his position one or two days prior.

    In China, where there are many people and a vast territory, and some areas were liberated relatively late, some adults still have a strong feudal consciousness and bourgeois consciousness. I think it's a high standard to expect all cadres across the country not to make mistakes and to have socialist and communist political morality.

    The fact that this person who made a mistake in this township was expelled proves that justice resides in the hearts of the people and that the Communist Party has strong leadership capabilities (of course, there must still be people in various places who have made mistakes and have not been discovered).

    (2) The cadres I have come into contact with in this township and this district (mainly Party members and members of the Communist Youth League) generally have very high political integrity: they obey the organization, pay attention to studying the policies and theories of socialist transformation of agriculture, implement the policies of the Party and the government, and attach importance to production. The Communist Party has the ability to lead and educate cadres to make fewer mistakes, not to make mistakes, and to deal with them separately when they do make mistakes. With the leadership of the Party at all levels, especially the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the Communist Party's cadres will definitely do a good job in rural affairs.

    But am I covering up the facts and distorting the truth? I think we will understand if we go to the countryside to see for ourselves.

    The Issue of Joining the Cooperative—That is, the Issue of Cooperativization
    Many people are concerned that some peasants have conservative ideas and are unwilling to join agricultural production cooperatives. This concern is justified and is a fact. But after seeing it on this trip to the countryside, I feel that the situation has changed somewhat, so I now have a different "estimate". I believe that if a major cooperative campaign of publicity and education is carried out today, writing out several facts that farmers can say they already understand, pointing out to the farmers what benefits they will get from joining the cooperative, and writing out several disadvantages they will face if they do not join the cooperative, then after hearing this, the number of farmers who express their willingness to join the cooperative will be very large. This is not only due to the achievements of rural work in recent years, but more importantly, due to the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, farmers' calculations should have new additions and subtractions:

    (1) It is not easy to get fertilizer, (2) It is quite difficult to hire cattle power, (3) It is not easy to conceal yields, (4) Those who lease out and till the land don't want to do it after encountering the unified purchase, (5) It is difficult to lend out high-interest loans, (6) Currently, there are also difficulties in raising pigs.

    In short, all "spontaneous" conditions are almost gone. What capitalist secrets are still hindering cooperation with others? Moreover, the older children and daughters-in-law have progressive ideas, and the younger children and grandchildren have also joined the Young Pioneers, which also has an impact on the political thinking of the elderly. As for households without labor, the idea of joining the cooperative should be easier to get through.

    In addition, single households with relatively conservative ideas may now be making the worst plans: not trying to make the seedlings good (because fertilizer is difficult to obtain and grain prices are low), and calculating that it is okay to harvest less grain as long as they have enough to eat. This kind of mood must not be allowed to spread. Only by patiently persuading them to join the cooperative can we benefit both the public and the private, and also have a good reputation.

    Of course, the "Three Fixes" policy on grain will certainly encourage farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, but since the policy was only recently promulgated, farmers do not yet understand it enough. The impact will be even greater after this autumn.

    Another point of view is that middle peasants will inevitably play a certain role in rural work due to their stronger abilities and skills. And most of the progressive youth in general (some of whom may have already become members of the Communist Youth League, probably because they have a certain level of education and are more likely to accept new ideas and new knowledge) are also mostly created by middle-peasant families; poor and hired peasants do not have time to send their children to school. People of middle-peasant composition are inevitably a little conservative in their thinking, so it is also advisable to organize them into cooperatives as soon as possible.

    In addition, since "spontaneity" is being suppressed, peasants who cannot see the long-term prospects of socialism are bound to brew dissatisfaction. Only by not putting them outside the cooperative can they be more easily educated and can they live and work in peace.

    Expanding the construction of cooperatives in a one-sided way, without first calculating whether there are backbones, and regardless of whether the new cooperatives can be consolidated, is easily pointed out as being unsound. But from the current political and economic environment in the countryside, I think it is right to be a little hasty about building cooperatives (being able to effectively solve the problem of investigation is also a great advantage, which will be mentioned below). Some things do not need to be worried about. Let go and do the work, it will be done successfully and well, but the detailed plan must be carefully formulated.

    The Issue of Grain Investigation
    This is a big trouble at the moment. Judging from the current situation in the countryside, it is hard on the cadres, annoys the peasants, and still cannot be investigated very clearly (I heard that some places have done a good job in mass work and have investigated clearly). In the end, of course, it is necessary to rely on the expansion and progress of mutual aid groups, especially the large-scale expansion of cooperatives, to be clear without investigating. At this moment, I would like to say a few words on the importance of the work of the sectional head in order to help with the investigation.

    Taking this township as an example, it is impossible to rely on the township party branch secretary and the township head alone to investigate the overall situation of the entire township. This is not to say that this township did not combine with the sectional head to work together, but rather that the combination was not enough. Please think about the matter of increasing the production of miscellaneous grains and vegetables: the whole township has 675 households, with dozens of miles of ground, and the increase in production of each household varies due to climate, manpower, and various conditions. How can township-level cadres know exactly how many pumpkins and wax gourds each household has grown? If the sectional head is carefully selected and constantly educated and supervised, each section has only 30 to 40 households, and the sectional head is more confident of investigating clearly. He has the conditions to help the township level, it just depends on how his work focus will be defined in the future.

    Please think about it, two months of unified purchase, four months of unified sales, if the investigation is not clear, there will be deviations, there will be disputes, and it will affect the national plan, which is really not something that can be ambiguous!

    The Issue of Grain Shortage
    The grain problem in this township appears to be tense, and I heard that some areas near this township are also tense. I personally saw that some people did not have enough to eat. Among the 675 households in this township, unified sales households accounted for 238 in 1954 and reached 361 in 1955. Unfortunately, I was unable to understand the situation of each household in depth. I originally wanted to "randomly check" the actual situation of the unified sales households, but unfortunately, I did not have enough time.

    The grain shortage in this township is mainly due to the reduced production last year. When the seedlings were budding, there was a lot of rain, which damaged the buds, making them flowery but not fruitful. The production was reduced by more than 370,000 catties compared to 1953, while the requisition was 400 catties more than in 1953, the purchase was 41,010 catties more, and the sales were 21,000 catties less.

    However, according to calculations, each person has an average of 500 catties of grain; probably because the sky reduced production and the investigation was difficult, the problem became tense.

    The Issue of Raising Pigs
    According to statistics in this district, the production of pigs this year is about 20% lower than in 1953, and the quality of meat and oil is very poor. The trend of declining production has not yet improved.

    Is it possible to transfer more bean cake to the countryside to feed pigs? Without rice to feed them, vegetables won't make them fat, but bean cake will help.

    Compiling and Printing General Small Booklets is Recommended
    Is it possible to publish more small booklets with a general nature and distribute them to district and township staff members above the level of sectional heads for study and publicity?

    Examples of topics for small booklets are as follows:
    (1) Cooperative Charter;
    (2) Accounting Knowledge;
    (3) Methods of eliminating flies, mosquitoes, and fleas, and methods of how to make manure tanks and manure ponds less obstructive to hygiene;
    (4) How corrupt elements and bad elements are punished, how model figures are commended, real people and real events, persuading good and punishing evil;
    (5) Comparison of the new and old societies: In the old society, bandits were rampant, killing people without blinking an eye, and prices were extremely unstable, etc.

    Not being accustomed to eating wheat has also become a rather serious problem in the rural areas of Hunan. Is it because people do not know how to ferment it? It is also possible to publish a small booklet on this.

    Several Things That Are Not Considered Small
    The meetings of the township, district, and county are endlessly busy, and there are many people in each meeting, but cadres often do not have time to speak. In this way, the meeting will inevitably become a task assigned by the higher levels. Cadres who go deep among the people and can accurately speak on behalf of the masses naturally expect the higher levels to listen. Therefore, some things can be done according to the assignment during the meeting, while some things need to be discussed a lot before being assigned.

    Some peasants seem to be tired of being told to increase production every day. I was therefore reminded of the following two things:
    (1) Entertainment activities seem to need to be done in a planned way. Young and middle-aged people may be willing to sing a song or watch a play even when they are hungry.
    (2) At present, there is surplus labor in the countryside. Can cooperatives start discussing a rotating holiday system? So that everyone can have a good time to play sometimes, or the evening meetings can be shorter; in the summer, mosquitoes bite, and in the winter, it is too cold and there can be less study in the evenings. These two things can sometimes be tried to be done on holidays, and can also be used to drive mutual aid groups and single households to do them together.

### 我在湘潭飞龙乡十二天

　　我在湘潭飞龙乡十二天
　　全国人民代表大会代表　易礼容
    我在湘潭第五区飞龙乡住了十二天，因为时间对我说来还是有限，视察得很不深入细致。
    现就这次下乡给我的启发，或者说就我这次对农村工作的一点点了解，试写一点意见。
    干部作风问题
    几年来不少关心农村工作，想把农村工作做得更好的人，不免时常担心干部作风问题。我自己也一样，认为如果干部作风不好，犯了各种错误，会影响农村工作的效果，使农民群众对党和政府不满
  （当然也有不少人说干部各方面都好的）。
    由于这次下乡的观察，我对这问题的看法比之以前所想所闻的根本有所不同了。现分项简单说明如下：
    （一）干部是有犯了错误的，甚至有些错误很严重。譬如这次我听说一个担任乡信用合作社主任兼片长职务的候补党员竟犯了如下三条错误：一、挪用了公款一百八十多元；二、有时有人对他不满，他就对那人说：你要知道，共产党是相信党员的，我是党员，你纵然敢于控告我，也一定无效；三、有一个半盲老鳏夫，今年春间原可得到政府一点救济费的，但因为平日说他的直话，他就把持不给。这人所犯的错误很严重，但在我到乡的前一、二日，他已被开除党籍并撤销职务了。
    人多地广的中国，有些地区解放又较晚，有些已成年的人，封建意识、资产阶级意识还很浓厚，一时要全国所有干部都不犯错误，具有社会主义共产主义的政治品德，我以为是高调。
      这一乡这个犯了错误的人被开除了，就可以证明公道自在人心，共产党的领导能力强（当然各地一定还有犯了错误而未被发觉的人）。
    （二）这一乡和这一区凡我接触过的干部（主要是党员团员），政治品德一般很高：服从组织，留心学习对农业实行社会主义改造的政策理论，执行党和政府的政策，重视生产。共产党有能力领导并教育干部少犯错误，不犯错误，犯了错误即分别加以处理。共产党的干部有了党的各级领导，尤其是以毛主席为首的中央的领导，一定会把农村的事情办好。
    但我是不是掩盖了事实，曲解了事实呢？我以为我们能下乡切实看看就会明白。
      入社问题—即合作化问题
    不少人顾虑有些农民思想保守不愿入农业生产合作社，这顾虑是正当的，是事实。但我这次下乡看了以后，觉得情况有些变化，故我现在另外有一种“估计”。我以为今日如果大作一番合作化的宣传教育运动，写出若干条农民心里可说已明白的事实，向农民指出入社对他有什么好处，又写出若干条不入社对他有什么不好处，农民听了之后表示自愿入社的人数会很多。这不仅由于数年来农村工作有成果，更重要的是由于随着粮食统购统销的实行，农民的算盘应该有新的加减：
      （一）搞肥料不易，（二）牛力颇难雇，（三）瞒产量不易，（四）出租和佃耕的人碰了统购不想干了，（五）高利贷难放，（六）目前喂猪也有困难。
    总之，一切“自发”的条件几乎全光了，还有什么资本主义的秘密妨碍自己和人家合作呢？况且大的儿女、媳妇思想进步了，小儿女和孙子也结了红领巾，这对年长的人的政治思想也不无影响。至于无劳动力的人家，入社的思想应该更容易搞通。
    此外，保守思想较为浓厚的单干户，此刻也许正在作最坏的打算：不求把禾苗作好（因为肥料难办，粮价也低），少扮谷子也算了，只要自己够吃就得。这样的情绪切不可使之蔓延，只有耐心劝他们入社才会公私两利，名誉也好。
    当然，粮食“三定”政策一定可以鼓励农民的增产情绪，只是政策才颁布不久，农民对它的了解还不够，今年秋后影响将会更大。
    还有一点看法，中农因能力和技术较强，在农村工作中必然会起一定的作用。而一般进步的青年（其中有一些可能已成为团员，大概由于有相当的文化水准，才易于接受新思想、新知识），也许多数是中农家庭造就的；贫雇农还来不及送子弟入学。中农成份的人，思想总不免保守一点，故也宜尽可能从速组织他们入社。
    另外，由于“自发”被阻遏，看不清社会主义远大前途的农民，不免酝酿不满，亦惟有莫把他们摆在社外，才更易于教育，才能使他们安居乐业。
    一味扩大建社，不先计算骨干有无，不顾新社能巩固与否，容易被指出这是不稳健。但我从今日农村的政治经济环境看，认为对建社的事急进一点是对的（能有力解决摸底问题也是一项大利，这点以下还要说及）。有些事不必顾虑，放手去做工作，会做得进也会做得好的，只是详细方案则须慎重拟定。
      粮食摸底问题
    这是当前一件大麻烦事。照目前农村情况看，苦了干部，恼了农民，仍然摸不很清楚（听说有些地方群众工作做得好摸清楚了）。最后当然须靠互助组扩大和进步，尤其是合作社大大地扩建，才能不摸就清楚了。此刻我拟就重视片长的工作以求帮助摸底一件事说几句。
    以这一乡为例，要靠乡支部书记和乡长三数人摸全乡的底势不可能；这不是说这一乡未结合片长一道工作，而是说结合得还不够。请把增产杂粮蔬菜的事想想：全乡六百七十五户，地面纵横数十里，每户增产情况因气候人力各种条件时有变化，试问一户南瓜东瓜究竟结了多少，乡级干部怎能心中有数？如果慎选片长，经常教育督促，每片不过三数十户，片长是比较有把握摸清楚的。他有条件帮助乡级，只是看今后怎样规定他的工作重点而已。
    请想想，两个月统购，四个月统销，摸不清底即出偏差，即闹纠纷，即影响国家计划，真不是可以含糊的事！
    粮食紧张问题
    这一乡粮食问题显得紧张，邻近这一乡的某些地区听说也紧张。我亲眼看到有人饭不够吃。这一乡六百七十五户中，一九五四年度统销户占二百三十八户；一九五五年度达三百六十一户。惜我未能深入了解各户情况。我原想“抽查”统销户的实际情况，无奈时间不够。
    这一乡粮食紧张，主要由于去年减产，禾苗抽苞的时候雨多，把苞浸坏了，华而不实，较一九五三年减产三十七万多斤，同时征较一九五三年多四百斤，购多四万一千零一十斤，销少二万一千斤。
    然而，据计算，每人平均有五百斤粮；大概天既减产，摸底又难，问题就紧张了。
      喂猪的问题
    这一区据统计今年猪较一九五三年约减产百分之二十，肉和油质都很差，减产趋势还未好转。
    可否多调一点豆枯下乡去喂猪？没有米喂，菜喂不肥，豆枯有作用。
      应编印通则性的小册子
    可否多出一点通则性质的小册子，散发给片长以上的区乡工作人员学习宣传？
    小册子的题目举例如下：
      （一）合作社章程；
    （二）会计知识；
    （三）消灭苍蝇蚊子跳蚤的方法，怎样能使粪缸粪池少妨碍卫生的方法；
    （四）贪污分子坏分子怎样被处罚的，模范人物怎样被表扬的，实人实事，劝善惩恶；
    （五）新旧社会的对比：旧社会土匪如麻，杀人不眨眼，物价极不稳定等等。
    吃麦子不习惯，也成了湖南农村颇严重的问题，是不是由于不知道发酵，也可出一个小册子。
      几件并不算小的事
    乡、区、县的会议忙个不了，一开人数又不少，但干部要说话往往没时候，这样会议就不免完全成为上级交代任务了。干部深入民间，能确切代群众说话，当然期待上级倾听。故开会有些事可照交代的就去做，有些事须多多商量然后交代。
    有些农民似对天天只叫增产，感到厌烦。我因此想到以下两项事：
    （一）文娱活动似须有计划地去做，青壮的人也许饿着肚子也要唱一个歌看一出戏呢。
    （二）目前乡间劳动力有剩余，合作社里可否着手拟议轮流假日制度？使大家有时能快意地玩玩，或者晚间的会开得短一点；夏天蚊子咬，冬天太冷晚间可少学习。这两件事有时试移到假日做，有时也可带动互助组和单干户一起做。
