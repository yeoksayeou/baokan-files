Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd:

Respected Chairman, dear comrades and friends:

As the Polish people solemnly hold the closing ceremony of the 10th anniversary of People's Poland, and also celebrate the handover and opening ceremony of the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science, the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China is extremely pleased and honored to have the opportunity to celebrate this grand festival with the fraternal Polish people. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to extend warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the Polish government and all the Polish people.

Ten years ago, the glorious Soviet army defeated the Hitler invading army in the anti-fascist war, and liberated Polish territory in cooperation with the Polish People's Army. Since then, the Polish people have shaken off the shackles of landlords and capitalists, taken control of their own destiny, established the People's Republic, and firmly embarked on the brilliant road of socialist construction. The Chinese people are jubilant for your achievements. Your achievements are also our achievements.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Polish people, due to the victorious completion of the Three-Year Plan for the restoration of the national economy and the successful implementation of the Six-Year Plan for building the foundation of a socialist economy, have built their country into a socialist industrial power with enormous economic potential. The Chinese people are encouraged and inspired by your achievements.

The People's Republic of Poland is a strong link in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It plays an increasingly important role in international affairs. The peace-loving Polish people with a glorious tradition of internationalism have not only made unremitting efforts to oppose the rearmament of West Germany and safeguard European peace, but have also carried out a resolute struggle to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. The Polish government's effective work in realizing the lofty goals of the Warsaw Conference for guaranteeing European peace and security, and in supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and carrying out the Geneva Accords, is a major contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace. The Chinese government and people warmly support these peaceful efforts of the Polish government and people.

There is a profound friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples. After the successive establishment of the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China, our friendship has developed to a new stage. The close cooperation between the Chinese and Polish people, which is developing under the great banner of internationalism, not only promotes the common prosperity of our two countries' economies, but also strengthens the power of the peace, democracy and socialist camp. The government and people of the People's Republic of Poland have consistently supported the just struggle of the Chinese government and people in international affairs, and have also provided much assistance to our country's economic recovery and development. Here, please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the government and people of the People's Republic of Poland on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

Recently, due to a series of efforts made by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries and peoples to maintain peace and oppose wars of aggression, signs of easing of the international situation have begun to appear. But we cannot fail to note that the American aggressive bloc still adheres to the so-called "policy of strength," actively engages in arms expansion and war preparations, continues to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan, and undermines the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina. These activities that are not conducive to easing international tensions cannot but attract the attention of peace-loving countries and peoples. Now, the Four-Power Conference is being held, and the Chinese people and the people of the world hope that this conference will achieve positive results. We are willing to work together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to further ease international tensions, strengthen trust between countries, and safeguard world peace.

I wish the Polish people new victories in consolidating the people's democratic system, building socialism, and defending European and world peace!

May the People's Republic of Poland become increasingly prosperous and strong!

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples!

Long live the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    在人民波兰成立十周年纪念年闭幕典礼上
    我国政府代表团团长贺龙的讲话敬爱的主席同志、亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    当波兰人民隆重举行人民波兰成立十周年纪念年闭幕典礼的时候，又逢华沙斯大林文化科学宫举行移交和开幕典礼，中华人民共和国政府代表团能有机会和兄弟的波兰人民一起欢庆这个盛大的节日，感到无限的愉快和荣幸。请允许我代表中国政府和人民向你们，并通过你们向波兰政府和全波兰人民致热烈的祝贺。
    十年前，光荣的苏联军队在反法西斯战争中击溃了希特勒侵略军队，并且在波兰人民军队的配合下解放了波兰的领土。从此波兰人民摆脱了地主和资本家的枷锁，掌握了自己的命运，建立了人民共和国，并坚定地走上了社会主义建设的光辉道路。
    解放以来，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，在伟大苏联真诚无私的援助下，由于恢复国民经济的三年计划的胜利完成和建设社会主义经济基础的六年计划的顺利实现，已经把自己的国家建设成为具有巨大经济潜力的社会主义工业国。中国人民为你们的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。你们的成就也就是我们的成就。
    波兰人民共和国是以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营中坚强的一环。它在国际事务中日益起着重要的作用。热爱和平的、具有国际主义光荣传统的波兰人民不仅为反对武装西德、维护欧洲和平作了不懈的努力，同时也为保障亚洲和世界和平进行了坚决的斗争。波兰政府为实现华沙会议保障欧洲和平和安全的崇高目的和为监督朝鲜停战协定的实施和贯彻日内瓦协议而作的具有成效的工作，对维护世界和平事业是一个重大的贡献。中国政府和人民热烈支持波兰政府和人民的这些和平努力。
    中波两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。在波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国相继成立以后，我们的友谊发展到了一个新的阶段。在伟大国际主义旗帜下日益发展的中波两国人民的密切合作，不仅促进了我们两国经济的共同繁荣，同时，也增强了和平民主社会主义阵营的力量。波兰人民共和国政府和人民在国际事务中一贯支持中国政府和人民的正义斗争，对我国经济的恢复和发展也给予了许多援助，在这里，请允许我代表中国政府和人民向波兰人民共和国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    最近以来，由于苏联和其他爱好和平的国家和人民为维护和平反对侵略战争所作的一系列的努力，国际局势开始出现缓和的迹象。但是我们不能不注意到，美国侵略集团仍然坚持所谓“实力政策”，积极进行扩军备战，继续干涉中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，破坏恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议。这种种不利于和缓国际紧张局势的活动不能不引起爱好和平的国家和人民的注意。现在，四大国会议正在举行，中国人民和全世界人民都希望这个会议能够得到积极的结果。我们愿意同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为进一步和缓国际紧张局势、加强各国之间的信任和维护世界和平而努力。
    祝波兰人民在巩固人民民主制度、建设社会主义、保卫欧洲和世界和平的事业中取得新的胜利！
    愿波兰人民共和国日益繁荣富强！
    中波两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营万岁！　（新华社华沙二十二日讯）
