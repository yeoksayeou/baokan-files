Column: Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Letter from the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page on May 29th published a stern criticism of the extravagant waste at the opening ceremony of Factory 501, which is necessary and correct. The planning and holding of the opening ceremony of Factory 501 was carried out under the direct leadership of our bureau, and the budget was also reviewed and approved by the person in charge of our bureau. Therefore, our bureau should bear the main responsibility for this error.
    This error is primarily because we violated the central government's policy of "increasing production and practicing strict economy." Because the leaders of our bureau have a serious bourgeois mentality of pursuing ostentation, we one-sidedly emphasized the so-called "grandeur" and "impressiveness" of the opening ceremony of Factory 501, forgetting the principle of thrift, and mistakenly believing that "grandeur" means spending more money. In fact, many of the items spent on the opening ceremony of Factory 501 were completely unnecessary, and some items could have been greatly reduced.
    Through this serious lesson, we must earnestly study the Party's policies and instructions, improve our ideological and political level, implement the policy of "practicing comprehensive economy and opposing all waste" in our specific work, and constantly be vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois ideology and various erroneous ideas. In addition to reporting this mistake to the Ministry of Heavy Industry for due punishment, we will also use this to educate all employees to prevent similar phenomena from occurring in the future.

    Letter from the Xi'an Municipal Public Utilities Bureau: Regarding the problems of the Xi'an Public Bus Company, our bureau organized a working group to conduct an inspection at the end of March this year. According to the materials currently available, many problems are even more serious than those revealed by Comrade Zhu Bo. The reasons for these problems are: on the one hand, the leadership of our bureau has serious bureaucratic work styles, and the problems in the work of this company have not been thoroughly resolved, especially after the inspection, the decision of the municipal party committee was not seriously and strictly supervised and implemented; but the main aspect is that the manager of this company, Gao Bocong, is arrogant, complacent, subjectively conservative, does not pay attention to instructions from superiors, does not accept opinions from the masses, and adopts an irresponsible attitude towards work. According to this inspection, we have suspended Gao Bocong and other derelict personnel for review, pending further action. Currently, Zhang Zhongping, Deputy Director of our bureau, has temporarily assumed the position of manager of the Public Bus Company and is responsible for rectifying the work of this company.

    Letter from the Jilin Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station: After the People's Daily published the reader's letter criticizing our blind management and serious waste, some leading staff and workers of our station did have a sense of resistance in their thinking. After self-inspection and exposure from top to bottom and from bottom to top, we realized that this resistance and complacency are extremely harmful.
    According to the materials checked out by everyone, it proves that the actual waste situation we have is even more serious than what was revealed in the newspaper. This is manifested in:
    1. In terms of purchasing equipment and basic construction, instead of proceeding from the actual needs and possibilities of our country, we mechanically followed the existing equipment of the Soviet shelterbelt stations, resulting in a larger and larger scale and more and more personnel. In addition to the equipment mentioned in the newspaper, the following are also stockpiled: two deep plows, two shrub plows, ten five-bottom plows, and four compactors. In addition, there are also parts for Nazi tractors worth about 10,000 yuan, four track springs for Stalin 80 tractors (worth more than 1,000 yuan), ball bearings worth more than 1,000 yuan, and a lot of fuel.
    2. There are also problems in the management system. The task teams have not thoroughly implemented the responsibility system and often violate operating procedures, resulting in continuous damage and loss of agricultural machinery and tools.
    3. The leadership style of the station is undemocratic, and there are also phenomena of unclear division of labor and overstaffing within the station.
    Now our station has decided to overcome complacency and the mistake of blind management based on the shortcomings found in the inspection, improve management, and strive to strictly save national funds.

    Letter from the Supply and Marketing General Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry: The criticism of "the quality of 'New China' brand tires is very poor" in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on June 6th is consistent with the facts. The Ministry of Light Industry has sent an investigation team to check the low quality and its causes.
    The tires mentioned in the original letter are handcart tires. Due to the general habit of thinking that "tires" are car tires or solid rubber tires, some units have misunderstandings. This needs to be explained.

### 批评建议的反应

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局来信：五月二十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊载了对我局所属五○一厂开工典礼铺张浪费的严正批评，是必要和正确的。五○一厂开工典礼的筹划和举行是在我局直接领导下进行的，经费预算也是由我局负责人审查批准的。因此这次错误应由我局负主要责任。
    这次错误首先是我们违背了中央关于“增加生产、厉行节约”的方针。因为我局领导人存在着严重的资产阶级讲排场的思想，所以对五○一厂开工典礼片面地强调所谓“隆重”、“像样子”，忘记了节约的原则，而且错误地认为“隆重”就是花钱多。实际上五○一厂开工典礼支出的项目有很多是完全不必要的，还有若干项目是可以大大缩减的。
    通过这次严重的教训，我们一定要认真学习党的政策和指示，提高思想政策水平，把“厉行全面节约、反对一切浪费”这一方针，贯彻到我们的具体工作中去，时刻警惕资产阶级思想和各种错误思想的侵蚀。对这次所犯的错误除报请重工业部给予应得的处分外，并以此教育全体职工，防止今后类似现象的发生。

    西安市公用事业局来信：关于西安市公共汽车公司的问题，我局在今年三月底就组织工作组进行检查。根据目前已有的材料来看，许多问题比朱波同志揭发的还要严重。产生这些问题的原因：一方面是我局领导方面有着严重的官僚主义作风，对这个公司工作中的问题一直没有彻底加以解决，特别是检查后对市委的决定没有认真严肃地监督贯彻执行；但主要的一方面是这个公司的经理高伯从骄傲自满、主观保守、不重视上级指示，不接受群众意见，对工作采取不负责任的态度。根据这次检查，我们已让高伯从及其他失职人员停职检讨，听候处理。目前我局张仲平副局长已暂行代理公共汽车公司经理的职务，并负责整顿这个公司的工作。

    吉林开通机械造林试验站来信：人民日报发表了批评我们盲目经营浪费严重的读者来信以后，我站部分领导工作人员和职工的思想上确实有一种抵触情绪。经过自上而下、自下而上的检查、揭发，我们认识到这种抵触情绪和骄傲自满思想是极端有害的。
    根据大家检查出来的材料，证明我们实际存在的浪费情况比报纸上所揭发的还要严重。这表现在：
    一、在购置设备和基本建设方面，不是根据我国的实际需要与可能出发，而是机械地向苏联防护林站现有设备看齐，因而摊子愈来愈大，人员也愈来愈多。现在积压的机具除报上已提出的以外，还有：深耕犁二台、灌木犁二台、五铧犁十台、镇压器四台。另外还积压了价值万元左右的纳齐拖拉机所用的零件，积压了斯大林八十号拖拉机的链轨弹簧四个（值千元以上），一千多元的滚球和很多油料。
      二、在制度管理方面也有问题，各作业队没有彻底执行专责制，经常违犯操作规程，以致不断发生损坏、丢失农、机具的情况。
    三、站的领导作风不民主，站内还有分工不明、人浮于事的现象。
    现在我站已根据检查出来的缺点，决心克服骄傲自满情绪和盲目经营的错误，改进管理，为严格节约国家资金而努力。

    轻工业部供销总局来信：六月六日人民日报“读者来信专页”中“新中国牌的轮胎质量很坏”的批评是符合事实的。轻工业部已派调查组去检查质量低劣的情况和原因。
    原批评信中所指的轮胎是手推车胎。由于一般习惯认为“轮胎”就是汽车轮胎或胶轮大车胎，以致有些单位发生误会。这是需要说明的。
