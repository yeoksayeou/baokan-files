Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 4th. The Indonesian Reception Committee held an Indonesian folk song and dance evening party on the evening of July 2nd to entertain the Chinese Cultural Delegation. Zheng Zhenduo, head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, Zhou Erfu, deputy head, and all members of the delegation attended the performance. Huang Zhen, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, was also invited to attend the evening party.

The members of the delegation greatly appreciated the colorful Indonesian songs and dances, especially those selected from the distant Sulawesi Province, Timor Island, and other places. The audience repeatedly requested many programs to be re-performed. The "Umbrella Dance," popular in central Sumatra, was one of the most popular programs, depicting a bride and groom joyfully traveling with umbrellas in the bright sunshine after their wedding. The superb dancing skills of the heroine in the "Mask Dance," popular in West Java, also received warm applause from the delegation and the entire audience.

The new musical piece "Sunrise over the Yangtze River," composed by the famous Indonesian composer Emir Pasaribu during his visit to China last year, depicted the joyful Yangko dance during the Chinese "May Day" celebration and the author's admiration for the magnificent scenery of the Yangtze River, West Lake, and other places. When the piece ended, a storm of applause lasted for a long time.

At the end of the performance, the head and deputy head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, Ambassador Huang Zhen, and other members of the delegation went to the stage to warmly shake hands with all the performers and thank them for their successful performances.

　　印度尼西亚举行晚会招待我文化代表团
    新华社雅加达四日电　印度尼西亚招待委员会在七月二日晚间举行印度尼西亚民间歌舞晚会，招待中国文化代表团。中国文化代表团团长郑振铎、副团长周而复和全体团员都出席观看了表演。中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇也应邀出席了晚会。
    代表团的团员们非常欣赏丰富多彩的印度尼西亚歌舞，特别是那些从遥远的苏拉威西省，帝汶岛和其他一些地方选出来的歌舞。观众一再要求许多节目重演。流行在苏门答腊中部的“伞舞”，是最受欢迎的节目之一，这个舞蹈描写新娘和新郎在举行婚礼之后，在明朗的阳光下快乐地打着伞旅行。在西爪哇流行的“假面具舞”中的女主角的精湛舞技也受到了代表团和全体观众的热烈鼓掌。
    印度尼西亚著名作曲家埃米尔·帕沙里布在去年访问中国时所作的新乐曲“长江日出”描写了中国“五一”节时欢乐的秧歌舞和作者对长江、西湖和其他地方的壮丽景色的爱慕。一曲既终，暴风雨般的掌声经久不息。
    演出结束时，中国文化代表团正副团长、黄镇大使和代表团其他团员都到台上同全体演出者热烈握手，感谢他们的成功的表演。
