Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 27th: According to a report in the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the governments of sixteen Afro-Asian nations in the United Nations have instructed their representatives to the United Nations to prepare a letter to be submitted to the Security Council this week, requesting the Security Council to pay attention to France's repressive measures against the Moroccan people. The letter accuses France of depriving the Moroccan people of their basic freedoms and taking severe repressive measures and terrorist actions in Morocco.

The letter states: The governments of Afro-Asian member states view the situation in Morocco with serious concern and anxiety. The letter says that the current situation in Morocco "is a situation that is bound to cause extremely serious reactions throughout Asia and Africa. It is a situation that is bound to intensify international tensions and endanger international peace and security."

The letter expresses the hope of finding ways to establish normal conditions conducive to realizing the legitimate and legal aspirations of the Moroccan people, and hopes that the Security Council will use its power to address the Moroccan situation.

Contrary to the wishes of the Afro-Asian countries, the United States is making every effort to support and interfere in France's colonial measures in North Africa. According to International News Service reports, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford recently discussed the Moroccan situation in Geneva with French Prime Minister Faure's military advisor. According to this news agency, Radford expressed "great unease" about the threat that the Moroccan People's Liberation Movement would pose to U.S. military bases in Morocco.

    联合国中十六个亚非国家
    要求安全理事会处理摩洛哥的局势
    新华社二十七日讯　开罗消息：据“金字塔报”报道，联合国中的十六个亚非国家政府已经训令它们驻联合国的代表拟就一封信件，在本周向安全理事会提出，要求安全理事会注意法国对摩洛哥人民的镇压措施。这封信指责法国剥夺了摩洛哥人民的基本自由，并且在摩洛哥采取严厉的镇压措施和恐怖主义行动。
    这封信说：亚非会员国政府以严重的关怀和忧虑看待摩洛哥的局势。信里说，目前的摩洛哥局势“是一种必然引起整个亚非两洲极其严重反响的局势。这是一种必然使国际紧张局势加剧和危害国际和平与安全的局势。”
    这封信表示希望找到建立有助于实现摩洛哥人的正当的和合法的愿望的正常条件的办法，并且希望安全理事会运用它的力量来处理摩洛哥局势。
    同亚非国家的愿望相反，美国正在竭力支持并插手法国对北非的殖民措施。据国际新闻社报道，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福不久前在日内瓦同法国总理富尔的军事顾问讨论了摩洛哥局势。据这家通讯社说，雷德福对于摩洛哥人民解放运动将给美国在摩洛哥的军事基地以威胁一点表示了“极大的不安”。
