The Rapidly Constructed Litang-Zhanjiang Railway
　　Tie Bing
　　On July 1st, on the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, a new railway—the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway—officially opened to traffic in the southern border region of the motherland.
　　Looking at old maps, there was a "railway under construction" symbol from Litang in Guangxi to Zhanjiang in Guangdong. In the past, this symbol often evoked hateful memories for the people of South China.
　　In 1938, the Kuomintang bandit gang, under the guise of building a railway, forcibly issued stocks and extorted a large amount of money from the people of South China. They also forcibly conscripted laborers to build the road. However, until they were annihilated here in 1949, for a full eleven years, the stocks had gone moldy, and the bones of many laborers who had been tortured to death had turned to ashes, yet not a single rail had been laid, and no reliable design documents had even been produced.
　　In August 1954, the Ministry of Railways decided to build this railway and requested that it be open to traffic by the end of 1955.
　　In October, when the shock troops of the motherland's railway construction—the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—began to construct this railway, the locations of some important lines, bridges, and tunnels had not yet been determined. Due to the urgency of time, it was impossible to wait for survey data and design documents, and only the policy of "surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously" could be adopted. Shortly after construction began, the South China Meteorological Observatory issued a forecast: the rainy season in South China in 1955 might arrive earlier than usual, and the rainfall might be greater than normal. Originally, under China's current technical conditions, and in the absence of survey data and design documents, it was already very difficult to build a railway trunk line more than 300 kilometers long in such a short time; now, with the threat of the rainy season, the difficulties were even greater.
　　Faced with this situation, the leading organs of the Railway Corps issued an urgent instruction, calling on all commanders and fighters, all accompanying staff, and all laborers to actively find ways to overcome difficulties, strive to complete the earthwork and foundation engineering of bridges and culverts before the rainy season arrives, and ensure that the railway is open to traffic ahead of schedule on "July 1st."
　　The Railway Corps soldiers enthusiastically responded to this call and fully demonstrated the role of the shock troops in railway construction.

　　The Yu River Bridge is one of the key projects of the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway. Due to the wide river, deep water, and complex geological conditions of the riverbed, pneumatic caissons were used to build the bridge foundation. This pneumatic caisson was not only never used by the Railway Corps soldiers before, but it was also the first time it had been used in New China. It relies entirely on high air pressure to displace water, requiring people to go deep into the riverbed to work, to work in high air pressure. On the Kangzang Plateau, thin air caused many difficulties for road builders; here, however, excessive air pressure caused great physical exertion. In addition to courage and hard work, it was also necessary to master this complex technology as quickly as possible. The commanders and fighters of the bridge-building unit quickly mastered the caisson engineering technology. They not only successfully built this huge iron bridge, but also trained hundreds of caisson workers and more than ten foremen. Some staff officers even became on-duty engineers.
　　The Mingshui Tunnel is also a key project. The progress of the tunnel project depends on the speed of opening the pilot tunnel, and the excavation of the pilot tunnel is inseparable from pneumatic drills. At that time, Xie Shunde was the only person in the entire work area who knew how to use a pneumatic drill. While insisting on his work, he taught the soldiers how to use pneumatic drill technology. In just one month, he trained thirty-one pneumatic drill operators, providing favorable conditions for the early completion of the Mingshui Tunnel.
　　If the speed at which the soldiers mastered technology was astonishing, then the soldiers' selfless labor attitude would be even more moving.
　　In February, cold waves continued to strike. The dark clouds that heralded the impending rainy season pressed on the heads of the construction troops and also on the hearts of the soldiers. Torrential rains came one after another, and the water levels of the rivers continued to rise. The foundation projects of all the bridges had to be completed ahead of schedule.
　　The leaders of the Fifth Company of a certain regiment assigned the task of building the foundation of Pier No. 1 of the Nanliu River Bridge to the Second Platoon. The soldiers of the Second Platoon fought in the pouring rain. The water in the cofferdam was knee-deep, and the rain kept falling, digging a shovel of mud and sand, and only half a shovel was left when lifted. Sweat and rain soaked the soldiers' clothes. However, they happily persisted in their work in the singing of "Not afraid of the cold river water, not afraid of the deep foundation, resolutely dig to the bottom, overcome Pier No. 1!"
　　"I see the rock!" On February 9th, the people at the bottom of the foundation cheered. At this moment, a stream of river water mixed with quicksand suddenly rushed in from one side of the cofferdam. The water in the cofferdam instantly rose to waist level. Ye Chuanwen and Zhang Jiawan took the lead in jumping into the water, followed by more than a dozen comrades. Blocking the leak with sacks could not stop it. "Take sacks and fill them with soil and throw them up!" Zhao Liancheng, the leader of the Second Platoon and a member of the Party branch, directed everyone in the water. After a tense battle, the quicksand was finally subdued. But at this time, Comrade Zhang Jiafang had been in the water, persisting in his work in the cold wave for thirty-two hours.
　　The company named after the hero Yang Liandi was responsible for rushing to build the Luchuan Middle Bridge. On the night of the Spring Festival, they also lit gasoline lamps and insisted on completing the concrete works of the north and south bridge platforms.
　　Rainwater flowed from the mountains and plains, converging into a torrent that rushed to the Long River. The cofferdam of a bridge pier burst open with a whoosh. The river water poured in, and it was about to submerge the piles and collapse the entire bridge foundation. At this critical moment, Communist Youth League member Luo Ganxi forgot his fatigue and danger, and bravely plunged into the bottom of the water, using his body to block the leak. The river water, mixed with mud and sand, crashed into him. Luo Ganxi felt that the river water was like a ferocious beast, violently impacting his spine. But at this time, he had only one belief: he must not let the river water rush into the cofferdam! He strained all his strength to resist the rushing river water. It was not until the comrades on the shore transported sandbags to block the leak that he was lifted out of the deep water.
　　Along the more than 300-kilometer-long railway line, there are countless such heroic stories. In order to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the country's economic construction, the soldiers created countless miracles. One engineer excitedly said to people: "When designing the progress, I calculated carefully and always felt that the time was not enough, but when I did it, I always finished ahead of schedule." When others asked him what the reason was, he said: "The mechanical efficiency and human physical strength have their limits, but the soldiers' enthusiasm for labor is infinite. Some people asked me what kind of progress this is, and I couldn't answer, so I had to say it was 'revolutionary progress'!" Yes, the people's soldiers are using this "revolutionary progress" to build the motherland and build the happy lives of the people!

　　Many factories and enterprises across the country and the broad masses of people in many regions actively supported the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway construction project. The support of the people of South China for the project is even more unforgettable.
　　In order to support the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, the governments of relevant areas in Guangxi Province and Western Guangdong District transferred capable staff to organize the "Road Construction Committee" to ensure the living supplies of the road construction troops and the needs of local materials. Young men and women along the line rushed to sign up to join the laborers, forming a labor army of 100,000 people.
　　Women in South China have an excellent labor tradition. On the construction sites along the line, female laborers of all ethnic groups, wearing various costumes, ran as fast as male laborers, carrying dirt baskets. Li Huizhen, a female member of the Communist Youth League, carried 950 baskets of soil every day within an 18-meter transportation distance. Many young men secretly cheered her on to compete with her, but in the end, Li Huizhen was still the winner. Tao Meizhen and Wu Qiming, students of Luchuan County No. 1 Middle School in Guangxi Province, went to the construction site during the winter vacation and asked to participate in the road construction work. The leaders of the construction site did not agree to their request at the time because they were young and had not participated in such intense labor. The two young people were very anxious. They said: "Socialist construction has come to our door. It is good for us to lay a stone with our own hands. Can we not participate? If it is really impossible, we will carry our own rice to participate in the road construction work." Finally, their request was finally approved. They spent the winter vacation excitedly and nervously in labor.
　　During the construction period, the laborers put forward many rationalization proposals. The "hanging basket soil dumping method" proposed by laborer Zhang Hualong alone can increase work efficiency by 30%. After this method was promoted throughout the line, it greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
　　Male and female laborers participated in national construction with great enthusiasm, and they were trained and educated in the construction, raised their socialist consciousness, and returned to the production front with victory and glory. At the end of the project, 305 people were accepted as members of the Communist Party of China, 4,499 people joined the New Democratic Youth League, and 10,882 people were commended for their merits.
　　The high wisdom and selfless labor of the soldiers and laborers enabled the road construction project to progress rapidly. The track-laying team, which laid tracks from north to south, quickly increased from laying 2.9 kilometers of track per day at the beginning to 3.3 kilometers, 3.9 kilometers, 4.94 kilometers, and on April 26, it broke the national record for manual track laying with a track-laying speed of 6.616 kilometers. The speed of track laying was astonishing, so that in many areas, before the masses had even thought about it, the train had already arrived at their doorstep.
　　In just nine months, the more than 300-kilometer-long railway was opened to traffic. Where the train arrived, the nearby masses came to welcome it warmly. When the train arrived in Yulin, it was raining. The nearby masses wore bamboo hats and raincoats, braving the rain and stepping on the muddy roads to see the train from all directions. They clearly know that the train brings them happiness; the train will accelerate their pace towards socialism.

    迅速建成的黎湛铁路
　  铁兵
    七月一日，在中国共产党三十四周年诞辰的时候，祖国南部边境有一条新铁路——黎湛铁路正式通车了。
    翻开从前的地图，从广西黎塘到广东湛江，有一条“未成铁路”的符号。在过去，这个符号时常引起华南人民仇恨的回忆。
    一九三八年，国民党匪帮曾经在这里以筑路为名义，强制发行股票，敲诈了华南人民大批钱财，而且还强征民工修路。但是，直到一九四九年他们在这里被歼灭以前，在整整十一个年头里，股票都发霉了，很多被虐待致死的民工的尸骨成灰了，还没有铺下一根钢轨，甚至没有提出任何可靠的设计文件。
    一九五四年八月，铁道部决定建筑这条铁路，要求在一九五五年年底通车。
    十月间，当祖国铁道建设的突击队——中国人民解放军铁道兵部队动工修筑这条铁路的时候，一些重要的线路、桥梁、隧道的位置都还没有确定。因为时间紧迫，就不能等待勘测资料和设计文件了，而只能采取“边勘测、边设计、边施工”的方针。开工后不久，华南气象台又发出预报：华南地区一九五五年的雨季可能提前到来，而且雨量可能比常年大。本来，在我国目前的技术条件下，在缺乏勘测资料和设计文件的情况下，用这么短的时间修筑一条三百多公里长的铁路干线，已经有很多困难；现在，再加上雨季的威胁，困难就更大了。
    面对着这样的情况，铁道兵领导机关发出了紧急指示，号召全体指战员、全体随军职工和全体民工积极设法克服困难，争取在雨季到来以前完成土石方工程和桥涵基础工程，保证提前在“七一”通车。
    铁道兵战士们热烈响应这一号召，充分发挥了铁道建设突击队的作用。
                        ×　×　×
    郁江大桥，是黎湛路重点工程之一。由于江宽水深，河床地质复杂，采用了气压沉箱来建筑桥梁基础。这种气压沉箱，不仅铁道兵战士们从来没有使用过，在新中国也还是第一次采用。它全靠高度的空气压力把水排开，人要深入到江底去工作，到高度的气压里去工作。康藏高原上因为空气稀薄给筑路人员造成许多困难；在这里，却由于空气压力过大，造成了体力的很大的消耗。除了勇敢和吃苦耐劳的精神以外，还必须最快地掌握这一复杂的技术。建桥部队的指战员们很快就掌握了沉箱工程技术。他们不但胜利建成了这座巨大的铁桥，还培养了几百名沉箱手，十多名领工员。有的参谋还成了值班工程师。
    鸣水隧道也是一项重点工程。隧道工程的进度，决定于打通导坑的速度，开挖导坑又离不开风钻。当时，整个工区里，只有谢顺德一个人会使风钻。他一面坚持工作，一面教战士们学习使用风钻的技术。在短短的一个月之内，他就培养了三十一名风钻手，为提前凿通鸣水隧道提供了有利的条件。
    如果说战士们掌握技术的速度是惊人的，那末，战士们的忘我的劳动态度就会使人更加感动。
    二月，寒潮不断地袭来。预示雨季就要到来的阴云，压在施工部队的头上，也压在战士们的心上。急雨一阵又一阵，各河的水位在持续地向上移动。各桥的基础工程都要提前完成。
    某团五连领导方面把修建南流江桥一号桥墩基础的任务交给了二排。二排的战士们在倾盆大雨中战斗。围桩里水深及膝，雨又不停地下着，挖一锹泥沙，抬起来只剩半锹。汗水、雨水，浸透了战士们的衣衫。可是，他们却在“不怕江水冷，不怕基础深，坚决挖到底，战胜一号墩！”的歌声中愉快地坚持了工作。
      “见着石头了！”在二月九日这天，基础下面的人欢呼起来。正在这时，围桩的一面突然有一股江水夹着流沙冲进来。围桩里的水顿时涨到腰部。叶传文、张家万带头跳下水去，紧接着十多个同志都跳下水去。用麻袋堵塞漏洞，怎么也堵不住。“拿麻袋装土掼上！”二排领导人、党支部委员赵连成在水里指挥大家。经过紧张战斗，流沙终于被制服了。但是这时候，张家方同志已经在水里，在寒潮中坚持工作了三十二个小时了。
    以英雄杨连第命名的连队负责抢建陆川中桥。在春节那天晚上，他们还点上汽灯，坚持完成了南北桥台的混凝土工程。
    雨水从大山、从平川流来，汇集成一股急流冲到龙河。桥墩围堰呼地一声冲出了一个漏洞。河水哗哗地涌进来，眼看就要淹没桩木，冲垮整个桥的基础。在这万分危急的时刻，青年团员罗柑辉忘记了疲劳，也忘记了危险，勇敢地扎到水底，用自己的身体堵住了漏洞。河水夹着泥沙，朝他身上撞来。罗柑辉只觉得河水像一头凶猛的野兽，猛力地冲击着他的脊背。但是，这时候他只有一个信念：决不能让河水冲进围堰！他拚着全身的力气，抵住冲来的河水。直到岸上的同志运来沙包堵住漏洞，才把他从深水中抬出来。
    在三百多公里长的铁路沿线，有无数这样英勇的故事。为了支援解放台湾，为了支援祖国经济建设，战士们创造了无数的奇迹。有一位工程师兴奋地对人说：“设计进度的时候，精打细算，总觉得时间不够，可是做起来总是提前。”别人问他这是什么原因，他说：“机械效能和人的体力有它的极限，可是战士们的劳动热情却是无限的。有人问我这算什么进度，我答不出，只好说它是‘革命进度’吧！”是的，人民的战士，正是以这种“革命进度”来建设祖国，建设人民的幸福生活的！
                      ×　×　×
    全国许多工厂企业和许多地区的广大人民积极支援了黎湛铁路建设工程。华南人民对工程的支援，更是令人难忘的。
    为了支援黎湛路，广西省和粤西区有关地区的政府都抽调出得力的工作人员组织了“筑路委员会”，保证筑路部队的生活供应和就地取材的需要。沿线各县男女青壮年，都争先恐后地报名参加民工，组成了一支十万人的劳动大军。
    华南地区的妇女，有优良的劳动传统。沿线工地上，穿着各种服装的各族女民工，和男民工一样，担着土箕飞跑。女青年团员李惠珍，在十八公尺运距内，每天担土九百五十担。很多年轻小伙子偷偷地加油跟她比赛，但结果李惠珍还是胜利者。广西省陆川县第一中学的学生陶美贞和吴启明，在寒假期间，到工地要求参加筑路工作。工地领导同志因为他们年纪小，又没有参加过这样紧张的劳动，当时没有答应他们的请求。这两个青年人可急了，他们说：“社会主义建设，建设到我们门口来了。我们亲手放上一块石头也是好的，不让我们参加还行？如果实在不行，我们自己背米来，也要参加筑路工作。”最后，他们的请求终于被批准了。他们兴奋而紧张地在劳动中度过了寒假。
    在施工期间，民工们提出了很多合理化建议。仅民工张华隆提出的“挂箕倒土法”，就可提高工效百分之三十。这种方法在全线推广以后，大大加快了工程进度。
    男女民工带着极大的热情来参加国家建设，在建设中又得到了锻炼和教育，提高了社会主义觉悟，带着胜利，带着光荣返回生产战线去。在工程结束的时候，有三百零五人被接受为中国共产党党员，四千四百九十九人参加了新民主主义青年团，一万零八百八十二人立了功。
    战士们和民工们的高度智慧和忘我的劳动，使筑路工程迅速进展。从北向南铺轨的铺轨大队，从开始每天铺轨二点九公里，很快提高到三点三公里、三点九公里、四点九四公里，到四月二十六日那一天，更以六点六一六公里的铺轨速度，打破了全国人力铺轨的最高纪录。铺轨的速度是惊人的，以致在许多地区的群众还没有想到的时候，火车已经开到了他们的门口。
  　仅仅九个月的时间，三百多公里长的铁路就通车了。火车开到的地方，附近的群众都来热烈欢迎。当火车开到郁林的时候，正赶上下雨。附近的群众戴着斗笠，穿着蓑衣，冒雨踏着泥泞的道路从四面八方来看火车。他们清楚地知道，火车，给他们带来了幸福；火车，将推进他们向社会主义迈进的速度。
