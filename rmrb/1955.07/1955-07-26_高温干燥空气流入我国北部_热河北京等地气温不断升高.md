Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: According to the Meteorological Observatory: On July 24th, some areas in Rehe Province, western Shandong Province, and central Hebei Province exceeded the historical extreme maximum temperature records. On the 24th, the maximum temperature in Chengde was 42 degrees Celsius, while the historical extreme maximum temperature was 39 degrees. On the same day, Chifeng was 45 degrees, historically 42 degrees; Baoding 43 degrees, historically 41.7 degrees; Jinan 43 degrees, historically 42.4 degrees. The maximum temperature in Beijing on the 24th was 39.6 degrees, which did not exceed the historical extreme maximum temperature. According to the temperature records for July in the past forty years, the highest temperature reached 40.5 degrees (July 3, 1942). In the past forty years, the temperature has exceeded 39 degrees in July eight times, the most recent being in 1952.
The reason for the high temperatures in the above areas is due to the inflow of high-temperature dry air from the west into northern China, forming a high-pressure area with little wind and no clouds. Within this high-pressure area, it has been exposed to more solar radiation heat for several consecutive days, further raising the air temperature. Since July 20th, temperatures have been continuously rising in areas such as Rehe Province, western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi Province, northern Henan Province, Hebei Province, and western Shandong Province. By the 24th, a high-temperature zone centered on Rehe Province had formed.
According to estimates from the Meteorological Observatory: In the next two or three days, the warm air mass will move away, and temperatures in these areas will drop.

### 高温干燥空气流入我国北部  热河北京等地气温不断升高

    高温干燥空气流入我国北部
    热河北京等地气温不断升高
    新华社二十五日讯　据气象台的消息：七月二十四日，热河省、山东省西部、河北省中部有一些地方最高气温超出了历年极端最高气温的纪录。二十四日承德的最高气温是摄氏四十二度，而历年极端最高气温是三十九度；同一天，赤峰是四十五度，历年是四十二度；保定四十三度，历年四十一点七度；济南四十三度，历年四十二点四度。北京市二十四日的最高气温是三十九点六度，并没有超出历年极端最高气温，根据过去四十年来七月份气温的纪录，最高时曾达到四十点五度（一九四二年七月三日）。在七月份温度超过三十九度的，四十年来出现过八次，最近一次是在一九五二年。
    造成上述地区高温的原因，是由于有高温干燥空气，自西方流入我国北部，形成风小无云的高气压，在这种高气压内，连日受较多的太阳辐射热，空气温度更加升高。七月二十日起，热河省、内蒙古自治区西部、山西省、河南省北部、河北省、山东省西部等地区，气温即不断升高。到二十四日就形成了以热河省为中心的高温区域。
    据气象台估计：未来二三天内，暖空气即将移去，这些地区的温度将下降。
