Director of the State Construction Commission, Bo Yibo, delivered a radio address on June 30th on the Central People's Broadcasting Station, entitled "Oppose Extravagance and Waste, Ensure Basic Construction Projects are Completed Well, Economically and Quickly."

In his speech, Bo Yibo first explained the great significance of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of China's national economy in realizing socialist construction and socialist transformation, and stated that the development of heavy industry is the central link of the First Five-Year Plan and the key to China's socialist industrialization. He said that basic construction is the most important means to realize China's socialist industrialization and solve China's long-term economic tasks. The current needs of the national economy can only be met temporarily and mainly by improving the utilization of existing fixed assets and fully leveraging the potential capacity of existing equipment. However, the further expansion of production scale, the change of proportional relationships between economic sectors and the distribution of social productive forces, that is, transforming a technologically backward agricultural country into a technologically advanced industrial country, depends on industrial basic construction. He said that the resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China called on "the people of all ethnic groups in the country to work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and over fulfill this plan." However, the phenomena of extravagance and waste in our basic construction are very serious, causing serious losses to the country. To correct this, we must first improve the work in design and construction. In design work, we must establish correct design ideas and improve design quality; in construction, we must improve the organization and work of the construction industry and improve the technical level of the construction industry.

Bo Yibo then talked about establishing correct design ideas and improving design quality. He said that design work is an important part of basic construction. After the national construction plan is determined, the quality of each project, whether the cost is economical, and whether the construction is reasonable, the design usually plays a decisive role. The quality and advancement of the design will also be related to the technical level of the entire industrial production in our country for the next ten or twenty years.

Bo Yibo said that there are many problems in our current design work, and the tendency of not paying attention to economy is the most prominent problem in the current design ideas. He said that in terms of civil building design ideas, a tendency of formalism and restorationism has grown and developed in recent years. Instead of designing comprehensively based on the principles of suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible, it unilaterally emphasizes the so-called aesthetics. Under the pretext of promoting national forms, it uncritically moves ancient architectural forms to modern buildings, uses expensive building materials, and adds many unnecessary luxury decorations and purely decorative false structures to the buildings. This inevitably leads to a large number of low-efficiency manual operations, while modern construction methods cannot be fully utilized. As a result, the cost of the building is greatly increased, and the usable area of the building is greatly reduced, and some are very uncomfortable to live in. Bo Yibo said that on this issue, not only the designers are responsible, but also many construction units that require "magnificence" and approve these wasteful designs and design budgets must also bear great responsibility.

In his speech, Bo Yibo talked about how to correctly inherit and develop national forms in civil buildings and how to understand the aesthetics of architecture. He also said that palace-style and temple-style buildings undoubtedly reflect the wisdom and artistic talents of our working people and predecessor architects. We can study and learn from them as ancient works of art, and appropriately adopt them in certain necessary public buildings. However, we must never ignore that some structures and decorations in palace-style and temple-style buildings also reflect the special requirements of the ruling class in the feudal era for the enjoyment and appreciation of a few people. In today's socialist construction, it is obviously not appropriate to uncritically promote and popularize them in actual construction. He said that, of course, designing a civil building to be suitable, cheap, and beautiful is not an easy task and requires creative labor. However, the country and the people have put forward such requirements, and this requirement is completely justified and reasonable. Then, our designers should work hard according to this requirement. This requirement can be done and should be done.

Bo Yibo then said that the bias of not paying attention to economic issues in construction also exists seriously in industrial design. During the First Five-Year Plan period, our major construction projects were designed with the help of the Soviet Union. These designs adopted the latest scientific and technological achievements and fully leveraged the effect of investment, which are examples for us to learn from. However, many projects designed by ourselves are not entirely in line with the correct design principles, and the losses caused by them are far more serious than those of civil buildings. Our economic construction is carried out in a planned way, and various enterprises must be well connected and coordinated. If comprehensive considerations are not made during design, it is easy to cause major losses and long-term unreasonable situations.

Bo Yibo said that in design, we should absorb all advanced achievements of science and technology as much as possible, which is undoubtedly. However, when considering advanced factors in construction, we must also combine the actual situation at that time and place, the current production level of building materials, the technical level of construction, especially the original equipment foundation and other specific conditions, and carefully calculate the economic effect. If we deviate from reality and unilaterally emphasize advancement, it will also cause great waste and even cause irreparable mistakes. He said that some of the projects in our country's First Five-Year Plan construction are reconstruction projects. The purpose of reconstruction is to fully utilize the original equipment. However, some factories abandoned the old factory site and old buildings during reconstruction, redesigned new buildings in distant places, and installed new equipment. It is called reconstruction, but it is actually equivalent to new construction.

Bo Yibo said that in design, we should also pay attention to saving the use of building materials in all aspects. For example, saving the use of steel is promoted as an important national technical policy in the Soviet Union, which is especially important in our country where steel production is extremely backward. Calculate that repairing one hundred kilometers of 110,000 volt transmission lines, using screw steel frames, requires 1,365 tons of steel, costing 1.5 million yuan. If reinforced concrete frames are used (which is completely possible), only 810 tons of steel bars are needed, costing 810,000 yuan, which can save 550 tons of steel and reduce the cost by 740,000 yuan. For example, many of our construction enterprises do not pay attention to using local materials. Design is a scientific work, which must be based on correct data and carried out according to a certain procedure. However, some of our projects often violate this principle and design without sufficient data, or even without considering the procedure. Surveying, designing, and constructing at the same time resulted in great waste.

Bo Yibo said that to eliminate waste in design and ensure the economical and rational use of national construction funds in design work, we must first establish correct design ideas among designers. It is necessary to launch a deep ideological criticism movement in the design departments to expose waste in design, analyze the reasons for these phenomena, and stipulate ways to correct errors, to improve the ideological level of designers and improve the quality of design. After such a movement, it can generally awaken designers to pay attention to economic issues, be able to seriously conduct economic analysis and economic comparison of designs, seriously study the cost of construction, the structure of construction, the effective utilization coefficient of construction, consider rationally using building materials, and consider how to facilitate the improvement of labor productivity during construction and ensure the economic rationality of production after completion. In this way, designers will make immeasurable contributions to the country in their glorious and important positions.

Bo Yibo said that ideological issues are fundamental and primary; however, only solving ideological issues cannot guarantee the elimination of waste in design. We must also establish some management systems for design work. First of all, it should be stipulated that all important projects must follow normal procedures. Preliminary designs are not allowed without a planned task book; technical designs are not allowed without preliminary designs; construction drawings are not allowed to be delivered without approved technical designs. Major reconstruction projects must first have an overall design. Only in special circumstances can the procedure be simplified with the permission of the agency responsible for approving the design. Secondly, a design budget system must be established to strengthen the review of design budget documents. He said that in order to speed up construction, reduce project costs, improve construction quality, and save design forces, we must actively promote the repeated use of design drawings and standard designs, and actively promote them in civil buildings first. He said that in order to improve the quality of design from a positive perspective, we must also strive to improve the technical level of designers. The fundamental way to achieve this goal is to proceed from the actual situation in our country and earnestly and systematically learn from the advanced experience of Soviet design work, especially to strive to learn to do the complete design of important factories. In recent years, our designers have indeed improved their design level with the help of Soviet experts, but they still cannot independently complete the complete design of an important factory. This should be doubled and strive to solve this extremely important problem within a few years. Only after our designers master the complete design skills of important factories can we gradually change the backward situation of design work in our country.

Regarding the issue of improving the organizational work of the construction industry and improving the technical level of the construction industry, Bo Yibo said that in recent years, although we have made great achievements in construction and accumulated certain experiences, there are still many problems in our work. At present, the more prominent ones are the chaos at the construction site and the serious waste. The reasons for these chaos and waste are, on the one hand, that we still lack experience in large-scale economic construction, plans are often changed, design documents cannot be delivered on time, organizational work is not strong enough, and the cooperation between Party A and Party B is not strict enough, etc. On the other hand, it is because construction workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of practicing strict economy and accumulating national funds, do not pay attention to economic accounting in their work, and have not paid due attention to the phenomenon of wasting state property.

Bo Yibo said that rationally and economically using building materials is an important part of overcoming waste and reducing project costs. In all construction costs, building materials generally account for 60% to 70% of the total construction cost. However, many of our construction units and construction units have serious irrationalities and waste in the procurement, transportation, storage, and use of building materials. He said that an important reason for the chaos and waste in construction is the insufficient understanding of the complexity of large industrial construction. Many projects are started hastily without making necessary preparations, which causes various tasks in construction to be unable to connect with each other, and often there are stoppages waiting for drawings, stoppages waiting for materials, stoppages of this project waiting for that project, idling on one side, rushing to work on the other, wasting manpower and materials, and delaying construction deadlines.

When talking about measures to overcome construction chaos and waste, Bo Yibo pointed out: First of all, it is necessary to actively strengthen the preparatory work before construction with a proactive spirit; without doing the preparatory work, it is better to postpone the start date slightly. After the preliminary design of the construction project is approved, the construction unit should carry out construction preparation work, start studying the design documents, understand the production requirements of the new plant, the order in which each building is put into production and its interrelationships, the general number of main projects, the supply of electricity, water, heat, and the general situation of various pipelines, investigate the economic and natural conditions of the construction area, and correctly prepare the construction organization design; allocate manpower in a timely manner, prepare materials; rationally arrange auxiliary enterprises, level the site, and do a good job in water, electricity supply, traffic roads, and temporary projects; try to use the buildings, structures, and transportation pipelines of the construction unit for construction as much as possible, to reduce temporary projects; study design drawings, and ensure a constant number of drawings reserves during construction. Secondly, it is necessary to rectify the construction organization to achieve unified command and unified scheduling on the construction site. Because modern industrial construction has high technical requirements, the amount of construction and installation engineering is very large, and the construction area is limited, it is necessary to organize many engineering companies to carry out construction at the same time to carry out such complex civil and installation engineering, which requires certain mechanical equipment and auxiliary enterprises, and more importantly, a large number of building materials and components. Under this situation, to avoid chaos on the construction site, there must be unified command and unified scheduling. Any large industrial construction must specify a general contractor in advance, who is fully responsible for completing the work on schedule, and other professional construction organizations are under its unified command. The construction unit responsible for the general contracting should not only make overall arrangements for the preparation work on the construction site before construction but also comprehensively integrate the operation plans of various professional companies during construction, organize the work of each construction unit, and make all construction departments on the construction site carry out construction in an orderly and coordinated manner. At present, the potential for labor productivity in the construction industry is still very large. The first is to strive for balanced production, reduce idling and stoppages, and increase the amount of work in the northern winter construction and southern rainy season construction, to increase the actual construction time each year from all aspects. The second is to improve labor organization, rationally use labor force, and continuously improve the technical level of workers' professions, thereby improving workers' labor proficiency. Attention should be paid to consolidating labor discipline, reducing the waste of working hours, and eliminating the current phenomena of lax labor discipline, late arrivals and early departures, and insufficient use of working hours. The third is to earnestly implement average advanced labor quotas and continue to promote the piece-rate wage system. The fourth is to pay attention to labor protection work and take necessary measures to ensure safe production. The fifth is to carry out labor competitions, launch rationalization proposals, use advanced experience, and mass inventions.

Bo Yibo said that the above-mentioned issues are the urgent measures to improve the current construction industry, overcome chaos and waste in work. However, to fundamentally transform China's construction industry, it is necessary to implement the industrialization of the construction industry. He said that at present, China's construction industry is still in a transitional period from the handicraft method to the mechanized construction with emphasis. The strength of general civil engineering is excessive, while the strength and technical level of professional building and installation such as machinery, electricity, and pipelines are insufficient and very low. If it does not develop in the direction of industrialization, it will be difficult to bear the increasingly heavy construction tasks of the country in the future.

Bo Yibo said that the use of prefabricated structures and components can make construction enterprises become industries that produce structures and components, and industries that can carry out installation on site. There is no doubt that this should become the direction of the development of China's construction industry. However, due to China's technological backwardness and insufficient funds, industrialized construction methods cannot be universally adopted at present, especially in general civil buildings, which will mainly rely on manual and semi-mechanical labor for a considerable period of time. In industrial construction, because the proportion of industrial construction will increase day by day in the future, especially many newly built enterprises designed with the help of the Soviet Union have adopted prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components on a large scale, if we do not adopt factory prefabrication and mechanized construction methods, not only can we not guarantee the quality, but we cannot install them at all. He said that in order to adapt to the development of China's national economy and the increasing needs of national basic construction, we must take active steps to make China's construction industry gradually transition to industrialization with emphasis.

Bo Yibo said that improving the technical level of the construction industry and ensuring project quality are also problems that must be solved in the current construction. At present, the phenomenon of poor quality in construction is still quite common. According to the statistics of 16 engineering companies in the construction engineering department system alone, there were 5,160 quality accidents in 1954, and the losses from rework and waste were 8.4 million yuan. He said that the causes of quality accidents, according to the statistics in 2014 accidents in North China, 44.7% were due to poor management and irresponsible technical personnel, and 35.2% were due to violations of technical operating procedures; this proves that many quality accidents are mainly caused by poor management and irresponsible technical personnel. To improve project quality, we must ring the alarm again for all construction workers and continue to strengthen the education of "Quality First, a century-long plan," and require all engineering and technical personnel and construction workers to strengthen the high sense of responsibility for ensuring project quality. At the same time, we must establish a strict material inspection system and quality supervision system, and resolutely fight against all phenomena that undermine labor discipline and do not comply with technical operating procedures.

Bo Yibo said that carrying out strict economic accounting, implementing various advanced quotas, promoting the piece-rate wage system, and improving labor productivity are another important part of improving the management level of construction enterprises, overcoming waste, and reducing construction costs. In the past two years, the labor productivity in the construction industry has been increasing year by year. In 1954, the labor productivity of the construction enterprises of various industrial ministries generally increased by about 18% compared with 1953. However, due to a large amount of idling, too few actual working days per year, and shortcomings in labor organization, the total annual output value of construction workers is still very low, far behind the industrial production departments. He said that in addition to making full use of existing prefabrication factories, industrialized construction should be implemented in key construction areas, planned establishment of prefabrication factories, increase of necessary mechanical equipment, improvement of mechanical utilization rate, further implementation of specialization of construction enterprises, organization of professional construction and installation companies such as mechanical installation, electrical installation, industrial pipelines, and foundation engineering, so that they have the necessary technical equipment and a certain number of talents who can master new technologies, and also planned construction of construction bases. These arduous tasks need to be solved step by step in a planned way in the future.

Bo Yibo said that our party has always attached great importance to economy and cherished national financial and material resources, and launched two national-scale production increase and economy movements in 1951 and 1953, which achieved great results. When we enter the period of large-scale construction, the Party Central Committee once again calls on the whole party and the people of the whole country to practice strict economy and increase production, which naturally has a more important significance. This should become our long-term and regular political task.

He said that practicing strict economy should be a regular task for every staff member, especially leading cadres, of all our construction units, design departments, and construction enterprises. The interests of the country and the interests of the people require each of us to practice strict economy. Only when everyone truly cherishes national assets and puts it into practice, only when there is an extremely strict economy system and it is seriously implemented, can there be a real economy system.

He said that practicing strict economy also requires all our staff engaged in basic construction to learn to calculate carefully, do a good job in economic work, and requires each of our staff to improve political vigilance and prevent hidden enemies from destroying us from within.

Bo Yibo finally pointed out in his radio speech that our basic construction tasks are grand and arduous. Ensuring the completion of the basic construction plan on schedule and laying a preliminary foundation for China's socialist industrialization is obviously not something that can be done without great efforts. It requires us to make a hundredfold efforts, promote initiative and creativity, and maintain a cautious and humble attitude. In this way, our tasks are guaranteed to be completed.

    反对铺张浪费现象，保证基本建设工程又好又省又快地完成
　　——国家建设委员会主任薄一波的广播词摘要
    国家建设委员会主任薄一波六月三十日在中央人民广播电台作了题为“反对铺张浪费现象，保证基本建设工程又好又省又快地完成”的广播讲话。
    薄一波在讲话中，首先说明了发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，对实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的重大意义，并说明了发展重工业是第一个五年计划的中心环节，是我国社会主义工业化具有决定意义的关键。他说，基本建设是实现我国社会主义工业化的和解决我国长远经济任务的最重要的手段。国民经济的当前需要，暂时主要的还只能依靠改善现有固定资产的利用状况，充分发挥现有设备的潜在能力来完成。而生产规模的进一步扩大，各经济部门间的比例关系和社会生产力分布状况的改变，亦即把技术落后的农业国变为技术先进的工业国，就非依靠工业基本建设不可。他说，中国共产党全国代表会议关于中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议中，号召“全国各族人民群众，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成这个计划而奋斗。”但我们在基本建设中的铺张浪费现象是很严重的，它给国家造成了严重的损失。为要纠正这一点，首先必须改进设计和施工两方面的工作。在设计工作中，必须树立正确的设计思想，提高设计质量；在施工中，必须改善建筑工业的组织和工作，提高建筑工业的技术水平。
    薄一波接着讲到树立正确的设计思想和提高设计质量的问题。他说，设计工作是基本建设工作中一个重要的环节。当国家建设计划确定以后，每一项工程的质量是否合乎要求，造价是否经济，建筑得是否合理，设计通常是有着决定性的作用的。设计的质量和先进性并将关系到我国今后十几年或几十年整个工业生产的技术水平问题。
    薄一波说，在我国目前的设计工作中存在着很多问题，不重视经济的倾向，是当前设计思想中表现得最突出的问题。他说，在民用建筑设计思想方面，几年来滋长和发展了一种形式主义和复古主义的倾向，不是全面地根据适用、经济和在可能条件下注意美观的原则进行设计，而是片面地强调所谓美观问题，在提倡民族形式的借口下，不加批判地把古代的建筑形式搬到现代的建筑上来，采用价格昂贵的建筑材料，在建筑物上增添了许多不必要的豪华装饰和纯粹为了装璜用的虚假结构，这就不可避免地造成大量使用效率很低的手工业的操作方法，而近代化的施工方法却无法充分利用，结果既使建筑物的造价大大增高，又使建筑物的使用面积降得很低，有些住起来也很不舒服。薄一波说，在这个问题上，不仅设计人员要负责任，不少建设单位要求“富丽堂皇”，批准这些浪费的设计和设计预算，也要负很大责任。
    薄一波在讲话中谈到民用建筑方面如何正确地继承和发展民族形式及如何理解建筑的美观问题。并说，宫殿式庙宇式的建筑，毫无疑义是反映了我国劳动人民和前辈建筑师们的智慧和艺术才能的，我们把它当作古代艺术品来研究和借鉴，在某些必要的公共建筑物里适当地加以采用，有时是可以的。但绝不可以忽视，宫殿式庙宇式的建筑物，其中的某些结构和装饰，也反映了封建时代统治阶级供少数人享用和欣赏的特殊要求。在社会主义建设的今天，显然不应该无批判地在实际建筑中加以提倡和推广。他说，当然，把一个民用建筑物设计得既适用、又便宜、又好看，并不是一件十分容易的事，需要创造性的劳动。但是国家和人民都提出了这样的要求，而这个要求又是完全正当的合理的，那末，我们设计人员就应当本此要求努力工作，这种要求是可以做到和应当做到的。
    薄一波接着说，不注意建设中经济问题的偏向，在工业设计方面也同样严重地存在着。在第一个五年计划期间，我国主要的建设项目，是苏联帮助我们设计的。这些设计采用了最新的科学技术成就，充分发挥了投资的效果，是我们学习的榜样。但是还有许多由我们自己设计的工程并不是完全符合正确的设计原则，它所造成的损失，远比民用建筑更为严重。我们的经济建设是有计划地进行的，各个企业之间必须很好的联系配合，如果设计时不作全面的考虑，就很容易造成重大的损失和长期的不合理状况。
    薄一波说，在设计当中应当尽可能地吸取一切科学技术的先进成就，这是毫无疑问的。但是，在考虑建设上的先进因素时，还必须结合当时当地的实际情况，当前建筑材料的生产水平，施工的技术水平，特别是原有的设备基础以及其他各种具体条件等，周密地计算经济效果。如果脱离实际片面地强调先进，也会造成很大浪费，甚至铸成不可挽回的错误。他说，我国第一个五年计划建设中，有一部分是改建工程，改建的目的是为了充分利用原有的设备，但是，有一些工厂在改建时竟丢掉了旧厂址旧厂房，在很远的地方重新设计了新厂房，安装了新设备，名为改建，实际等于新建。
    薄一波说，设计中还要注意从各方面考虑节约地使用建筑材料，比如节省地使用钢材在苏联是作为国家一项重要的技术政策来推行，这在钢铁生产异常落后的我国，尤其有重要意义。计算一下修一百公里十一万伏安的输电线路，采用螺丝钢架，就需要钢材一千三百六十五吨，造价一百五十万元，如采用钢筋水泥架（这是完全可以的），只需钢筋八百一十吨，造价八十一万元，可节省钢材五百五十吨，降低造价七十四万元。又如就地取材，我们许多建筑企业也是不注意的。设计是一件科学的工作，必须有正确的资料作为依据，按照一定的程序进行，但是我们有一些工程往往违反了这一原则，没有足够的资料，就设计，甚至不去考虑程序。边勘探、边设计、边施工，结果造成了很大的浪费。
    薄一波说，要消灭设计中的浪费现象，保证在设计工作中节俭地、合理地使用国家的建设资金，首先必须在设计人员中树立正确的设计思想，有必要在设计部门中展开一次深刻的思想批判运动，揭发设计中的浪费现象，分析产生这些现象的原因，并规定纠正错误的办法，以提高设计人员的思想水平，提高设计的质量。经过这样一个运动，能够在设计人员中普遍唤起对于经济问题的重视，能够认真地进行设计的经济分析和经济比较，认真地研究建筑的造价，建筑的结构，建筑的有效利用系数，考虑合理地使用建筑材料，考虑如何有利于施工中间提高劳动生产率和保证完工以后生产的经济合理。这样，设计人员就将在自己这个光荣而重要的岗位上，给国家作出不可估量的贡献。
    薄一波说，思想问题是基本的，主要的；但是，单只解决思想问题，还不能保证消灭设计中的浪费现象，我们还必须建立起一些设计工作的管理制度。首先，应该规定，一切重要的工程必须按照正常的程序办事，没有计划任务书，不许进行初步设计；没有初步设计，不许进行技术设计；没有批准技术设计，不准交付施工图，重大的改建工程必须先有总体设计，只有在特殊情况下，经过负责审批设计的机关的许可，程序才可以简化。其次，必须建立设计预算制度，加强对设计预算文件的审查工作。他说，为了加快建筑速度，降低工程造价，提高建筑质量，节省设计力量，我们要积极推广重复使用设计图纸和标准设计，先在民用建筑中积极推行。他说，为了从积极方面来提高设计的质量，我们还必须努力提高设计人员的技术水平。而达到这一目的的根本方法，就是从我国当前的实际情况出发，认真地、系统地学习苏联设计工作的先进经验，特别是要努力学会做重要工厂的全部设计。几年来我们的设计人员在苏联专家帮助下，设计水平确已有所提高，但至今还不能独立做出一个重要工厂的全部设计，这还应该加倍努力，争取在几年之内解决这个极关重要的问题。只有我们设计人员掌握了重要工厂全部设计技能以后，才能逐步改变我国设计工作的落后状况。
    关于改善建筑工业的组织工作和提高建筑工业的技术水平的问题，薄一波说，几年来，我们在施工方面虽然取得了很大成绩，也积累了一定的经验，但在工作中还存在着很多问题，目前比较突出的是，施工现场混乱，浪费现象严重。产生这些混乱和浪费现象的原因，一方面是我们对于大规模经济建设，还缺乏经验，计划经常变动，设计文件不能按时交付，组织工作不够强，以及甲乙双方协作配合不够严密等等。另一方面却是由于建筑工作人员对厉行节约，积累国家资金的意义认识不足，在工作中不注意经济核算，对浪费国家财产的现象，没有引起应有的重视。
    薄一波说，合理地节省地使用建筑材料，是克服浪费和降低工程造价的重要环节。在全部建筑造价中，建筑材料一般都占建筑总成本的百分之六十到七十。而我们不少的建设单位和施工单位，在建筑材料的采购、运输、保管和使用方面，都存在着严重的不合理和浪费现象。他说，造成施工中混乱和浪费现象的一个重要原因，是由于对大工业建设的复杂性认识不足，很多工程没有作好必要的准备，就仓促开工，因而造成施工中各种工作不能互相衔接，经常发生停工待图、停工待料、停这一工程待那一工程，一边窝工、一边赶工，浪费人力材料和延缓建设期限。
    薄一波在讲到克服施工混乱和浪费现象的措施时指出：首先，要以主动精神，积极加强施工前的准备工作；没有做好准备工作，宁可把开工日期稍加推迟。施工单位在建设工程初步设计批准以后，即应进行施工准备工作，着手研究设计文件，了解新建厂的生产要求，各建筑物投入生产的次序及其相互关系，主要工程概数、供电、供水、供热及各种管路的概略情况，调查施工地区经济和自然条件，正确地编制施工组织设计；适时地调配人力、准备材料；合理地安排附属企业，平整场地，搞好水、电供应、交通道路和临时工程；尽可能争取利用建设单位的房屋、建筑物和交通管道，供施工之用，以减少临时工程；学习设计图纸，并保证施工中经常的一定数量的图纸储备。其次，就要整顿施工组织，作到工地上统一指挥，统一调度。由于近代工业建设技术要求很高，建筑安装工程量很大，而施工区域面积有限，要进行这样复杂的土建和安装工程，就需要组织许多工程公司同时进行施工，就需要一定的机械设备和附属企业，更需要供应大量的建筑材料和构件。在这种情况下，要避免施工现场的紊乱现象，就必需有统一的指挥和统一的调度。任何一项大的工业建设，都必须事先指定施工总承包人，他对按期完工负总的责任，其他专业的建筑机构，受它的统一指挥。负责总承包的施工单位，不仅在施工前应对施工现场的准备工作要进行统筹安排，在施工当中还应综合各专业公司的作业计划，将各施工单位的工作组织起来，使工地上的一切施工部门，有秩序地协调地进行施工。目前在建筑工业中劳动生产率的潜力还是很大的，首先是大力争取均衡生产、减少窝工、停工现象，增加北方冬季施工和南方雨季施工的工作量，从各方面来增加每年实际施工的时间。第二要改善劳动组织，合理地使用劳动力，不断提高工人专业的技术水平，从而提高工人的劳动熟练程度。要注意巩固劳动纪律，减少工时的浪费，消除目前劳动纪律松弛、迟到早退和不充分利用工作时间的现象。第三要认真贯彻平均先进的劳动定额，继续推行计件工资制。第四要注意劳动保护工作，采取必要措施、保证安全生产。第五是开展劳动竞赛、开展合理化建议、运用先进经验和群众的创造发明。
    薄一波说，以上所提到的几个问题，是改善目前建筑工业、克服工作中的混乱和浪费现象的迫切措施，但要从根本上改造我国建筑工业，那就必须实行建筑业的工业化。他说，目前我国建筑工业，还是处在从手工业方式有重点地逐步地转到机械化施工的过渡时期，一般土木建筑的力量过剩，机器、电气、管道等专业建筑安装的力量不足、技术水平很低、如果不向工业化的方向发展，是难于负担起国家今后日益繁重的建设任务的。
    薄一波说，采用装配式结构和构件，就可能使建筑企业成为生产结构和构件的工业，成为能在现场进行安装的工业。毫无疑义，这应该成为我国建筑工业发展的方向，但由于我国技术落后、资金不足、目前还不能普遍采用工业化的施工方法，特别在一般民用建筑中，在相当时间内，主要还要靠手工的和半机械的劳动。在工业建设中，由于今后工业建设的比重日益增多，特别是许多苏联帮助设计的新建企业已大量采用了装配式的钢筋混凝土结构和构件，我们如果不采用工厂预制和机械化施工方法，不但不能保证质量，而且根本不能安装起来。他说，为了适应我国国民经济的发展和国家基本建设日益增长的需要，我们必须采取积极步骤，使我国的建筑工业逐步地有重点地过渡到工业化。
    薄一波说，提高建筑工业的技术水平，保证工程质量，也是目前施工中必须努力解决的问题。目前建筑当中质量不好的现象，还相当普遍。仅据建筑工程部系统十六个工程公司的统计，一九五四年发生质量事故就有五千一百六十次，返工浪费的损失有八四○万元。他说，造成质量事故的原因，根据华北二○一四次事故中统计，属于管理不善、技术人员不负责任的，占百分之四十四点七，违反技术操作规程的，占百分之三十五点二；由此证明，很多质量事故，主要是管理工作不善、技术人员不负责任所造成。为要提高工程质量，就必须对全体建筑工作者再次敲起警钟，必须继续加强“百年大计，质量第一”的教育，要求全体工程技术人员和建筑工人，加强保证工程质量的高度责任感。同时必须建立严格的材料检验制度和质量监督制度，坚决向一切破坏劳动纪律和不遵守技术操作规程的现象作斗争。
    薄一波说，进行严格的经济核算，贯彻各种先进定额，推行计件工资制，提高劳动生产率，是提高建筑企业管理水平、克服浪费、降低建筑成本的另一个重要环节。两年来，建筑工业中的劳动生产率，逐年都有所提高，一九五四年各工业部建筑企业的劳动生产率，一般比一九五三年提高百分之十八左右，但由于大量窝工，每年实际工作日太少和劳动力组织方面的缺点，建筑工人总的年产值还是很低的，远远落后于各工业生产部门。他说，推行工业化施工除充分利用现有的预制工厂外，应在重点建设地区、有计划地建立预制工厂，增加必要的机械设备，提高机械利用率，进一步实行建筑企业的专业化，组织机械安装、电气安装、工业管道、基础工程等专业建筑安装公司，使他们拥有必要的技术装备和一定数量的能掌握新技术的人才，还要有计划地建设建筑基地。这些繁重的任务，都有待于我们今后有计划地一步步地加以解决。
    薄一波说，我们的党，历来就是十分重视节约，十分爱惜国家财力和物力的，并曾在一九五一年和一九五三年发动了两次全国规模的增产节约运动，收到了巨大效果。当我们进入大规模建设时期，党中央再次号召全党和全国人民厉行节约、增加生产，自然有其更重要的意义，这应当成为我们长期的经常的政治任务。
    他说，厉行节约应该是我们一切建设单位、设计部门和建筑企业的每一个工作人员特别是领导干部经常的任务。国家的利益和人民的利益要求我们每一个人厉行节约，只有当每一个人真正爱惜国家资财而且身体力行的时候，只有有了极严格的节约制度并认真执行起来的时候，才能有真正的节约制度。
    他说厉行节约，还要求我们所有从事基本建设的工作人员，学会精打细算、做好经济工作，并要求我们每个工作人员，提高政治警惕性，防止暗藏的敌人从内部来破坏我们。
    薄一波在广播讲话中最后指出，我们基本建设任务是宏大的，繁重的，保证按期完成基本建设计划，为我国的社会主义工业化奠定初步基础，显然不是一件不经过重大努力就可以办到的事，需要我们百倍努力，发扬主动精神和创造性，保持谨慎谦虚的态度。如此，我们的任务就有保证可以完成。
