　　The Life of North Vietnamese Children After the Restoration of a Peaceful Environment
　　Phan Thi An, Secretary-General of the Vietnam National Committee for the Protection of Children

    Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Vietnam People's Army and the Vietnamese people for independence and peace, and thanks to the warm support of peace-loving people all over the world, the imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam was stopped.

    In the northern part of our country, this brought great joy to the children. A new air, the air of peace, permeated the land of northern Vietnam. In Viet Bac, the cradle of the resistance war, in the area north of the 17th parallel, children are singing their own composed songs of peace as they head to school. Below are the lyrics of the Hanoi children singing about the liberation of the capital and singing about Uncle Ho's return:

    My heart is filled with joy living in the liberated capital,
    How happy I am that Uncle Ho is with us,
    Happy, I can go to class with my friends
    No more colonial soldiers blocking our way.

    The children in the liberated areas, who had previously suffered greatly from enemy harassment and countless killings and plunder, now happily express the joy of their peaceful lives:

    White doves fly across the clear blue sky,
    Telling us that peace has come to the land.
    Bombs no longer explode beside me,
    I can rest assured
    To eat hot, steaming rice.
    I study with my classmates,
    Uncle Ho's photo inspires us,
    There is no worry in my heart.

    In the joy of peaceful life, the children also care about the children in other places, especially the North African friends who have recently suffered massacres:

    We read the "People's Daily" yesterday,
    Knowing that the enemies of peace killed six hundred of our friends,
    Our North African friends are suffering,
    Sadness and resentment boil in our hearts!

    This kind of love for life, wholehearted trust in President Ho Chi Minh, and internationalist friendship, would not be possible without material and spiritual guarantees. In fact, although there are still countless difficulties in the national unification and reconstruction work, our democratic government and our people have made great efforts to create the necessary conditions for carrying out children's learning and recreation.

    Land reform has greatly improved the living standards of farmers. In the land reform, thousands of children of poor peasants were allocated four "chao" (Note: one Vietnamese "mu" is divided into ten "chao," and one Vietnamese "mu" equals 5.5 Chinese "mu") of land per person. Many farmers' households were allocated as much as 4.5 hectares of land. With the people's power and land, and the distribution of agricultural tools, farmer parents no longer have to worry about the future of their children. These children, who had been threatened by hunger before liberation, can now enjoy learning opportunities and wear colorful clothes, even the poorest children who used to be slaves of landlords or rich peasants. After the land reform, each township has at least one primary school with four classes, and each village has a pre-school class for children under seven years old. From 1953 to 1954, the number of primary schools and pre-school classes in the newly liberated areas has increased to 115,000. Public and private schools resumed classes immediately from the day of liberation, and the spirit of people's democratic culture gradually replaced the spirit of the decadent and degenerate slave culture in the curriculum.

    The Young Pioneers organization has established grass-roots organizations in schools, enterprises, urban areas, and rural areas, and expanded to the newly liberated areas. It is the joy of the Young Pioneers. These children, who had been living in oppression and suffering, now participate in various collective learning and recreational gatherings organized for them like little birds flying out of a cage. In February of this year, the "Avant-Garde" newspaper of the Vietnam Youth League organized a "Children's Literary and Art Competition Celebrating Peace," receiving 4,500 children's poems and songs, and 1,000 drawings. These works reveal patriotic enthusiasm and love for peace and Uncle Ho.

    Thousands of children participated in picnics. In celebrating this year's Spring Festival, 2,700 Hanoi children participated in picnics.

    Vietnamese children will never forget that memorable day. The people celebrated Uncle Ho and the democratic government's return to the capital on January 1, 1955. Thousands of children marched in dense formations to Ba Dinh Square, where a grand celebration was held. As soon as they saw Uncle Ho waving to them, they could no longer control themselves, jumping and cheering, unwilling to leave the square. The Chairman personally used his fatherly voice on the broadcast to ask them to leave so that the subsequent teams could move forward, and only then did the children happily move forward. This touching scene proved how much the children love the Chairman.

    In peaceful life, the work of protecting children has made certain progress. Rural women, under the guidance of the Vietnam Women's Union, are learning how to better educate children. After the land reform, the economic level of family life has improved, life has returned to normal, and the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. The infant mortality rate in the enemy-occupied areas was very high.

    In Nghe An Province, after solving the problem of women's labor force participating in production, women organized 552 mutual aid baby-holding groups and 2,168 mutual aid delivery groups. Young mothers are able to participate in production because their children are well cared for. Mothers can rest assured before and after childbirth, and mutual aid groups will help them do the work in the fields. Old women spend all their time taking care of the children, and the mothers of the children they take care of cultivate the land for them.

    All state-owned enterprises have their own nurseries, which have developed in simple conditions. The Women's Federation has trained cadres for the nurseries. The government and the people give very meticulous care to the children brought from South Vietnam to North Vietnam by their parents. Nearly 20,000 children are attending school in North Vietnam. Schools, hospitals, and nurseries in Hanoi reserve places for children from South Vietnam.

    The North Vietnamese children, who have obtained a peaceful and happy life and have a bright future, have not forgotten their South Vietnamese brothers and sisters who are still in dire straits. They send their sympathy and encouragement with such songs:

    We live happily in peace,
    Singing and learning freely.
    We do not forget our friends in the distance,
    They face unfair suffering.
    But we will gather together,
    In the big family of our unified motherland,
    To celebrate a happy life,
    To plant beautiful flowers all over paradise.

    For the sake of the children, for their present and future, Vietnamese parents feel even more responsible for consolidating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—the base of peace in Vietnam and happiness for Vietnamese children—, unifying the country on the basis of peace and democracy, and striving for the realization of comprehensive elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

### 恢复和平环境以后的北越儿童的生活

　　恢复和平环境以后的北越儿童的生活
　　越南保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长　潘氏安
    由于越南人民军和越南人民争取独立和和平的英勇斗争，由于全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，帝国主义的侵略战争在越南被停止了。
    在我国的北部，这给儿童带来了极大的欢乐。新的空气，和平的空气弥漫在祖国北部的土地上。在抗战摇篮的越北，在十七线以北的地方。孩子们唱着自己编的和平之歌走向学校。底下是河内的孩子们歌唱首都的解放和歌唱胡伯伯还都的歌词：
    我满心欢喜生活在解放了的首都，
    我多么快乐胡伯伯和我们在一起，
    高兴呀，我能和朋友们一同去上课
    再没有殖民者的兵士阻挡我们的道路。
    解放区的孩子们以前曾经深受敌人的骚扰，遭受无数的杀戮和掠夺，现在快乐地说出他们和平生活的喜悦：
    洁白的鸽子飞过碧蓝的晴空，
    告诉我们和平已经来到大地。
    炸弹不再在我身旁爆炸，
    我可以放心的
    吃上热气腾腾的大米饭。
    我和同学们一起学习，
    胡伯伯的照片鼓舞着我们，
    我的心里没有忧虑。
    在和平生活的欢乐中，孩子们还关心着其他地方的小朋友们，特别是最近遭受了大屠杀的北非朋友们：
    我们昨天读到了“人民报”，
    知道和平的敌人杀死了我们六百个朋友，
    我们北非的朋友遭受苦难，
    悲伤和愤恨在我们的心中沸腾！
    这种对生活的热爱，对胡志明主席的全心全意的信任，和国际主义的友谊，如果没有物质和精神的保证是不可能产生的。事实上，虽然全国的统一和恢复建设工作还存在着无数困难，但我们的民主政府和我们的人民已经尽了极大的努力为开展儿童的学习和文娱创造了必要的条件。
    土地改革大大提高了农民的生活水平。成千上万贫农的子女在土改中每人分到四“抄”（注：越南一亩分为十抄，一越亩等于中国亩五亩半）土地。很多农户分到四公顷半地之多。有了人民的政权又有了地，分了农具，农民父母们就不必再为他们孩子的前途担忧了，这些孩子在解放以前一直遭受饥饿的威胁，但是如今，曾经给大地主或富农当奴婢的最贫苦的孩子也享受到学习的机会，穿上了花衣服。土地改革以后，每个乡至少有一个包括四个班的初等学校，每个村庄有一个学前班，收纳七岁以下的儿童。自一九五三到一九五四年新解放区的小学校和学前班的数字已增加到十一万五千个。公立和私立学校自解放日起立即复学，人民民主主义文化的精神逐渐在教程中代替了腐朽堕落的奴隶文化的精神。
                ×　×　×
    少年先锋队组织在学校里企业单位里，市区和农村里建立了基层组织，并向新解放区扩展。它是少先队员们的欢乐。这些儿童以前一直生活在压迫和痛苦之中，现在像飞出笼子的小鸟一样参加各种为他们组织的集体学习和文娱集会。今年二月，越南青年联盟的“前卫”报组织了一个“庆祝和平儿童文艺竞赛大会”，收到四千五百篇儿童的诗和歌谣，一千张图画。这些作品流露了爱国热情，和对和平、对胡伯伯的热爱。
    成千的儿童参加野餐会。在庆祝今年春节时，有二千七百个河内的儿童参加了野餐会。
    越南儿童永远不能忘记那值得纪念的一天。人民在一九五五年一月一日庆祝胡伯伯和民主政府还都。成千儿童排着密密的队伍走向举行盛大庆祝的巴亭广场。一当他们看到胡伯伯向他们挥手，他们再也控制不住，跳跃着、欢呼着，不愿离开广场。主席亲自用他父亲般的声音在广播器前要他们离开，以便后来的队伍向前进行，这样孩子们才快乐地向前走了。这个动人的场面证明了孩子们多么热爱主席。
    在和平生活中，保卫儿童的工作有着一定的进展。农村妇女在越南妇女联合会的指导下学习怎样更好的教养儿童。土地改革后，家庭生活的经济水平提高了，生活恢复正常了，婴儿死亡率因之大大降低。而在敌占区婴儿死亡率是非常高的。
    在义安省，解决了妇女劳动力参加生产的问题后，妇女组织了五百五十二个互助抱娃娃组和二千一百六十八个分娩互助组。年青的母亲们能够参加生产，因为她们的孩子受到可靠的照顾。母亲们在分娩前后可以放心，互助组会帮助她们做好田间的工作。老太太们用全部时间来照顾孩子，她们所照看的孩子们的妈妈替她们种地。
    所有的国营企业有自己的托儿所，这些托儿所在很简单的情况下发展起来。妇联为托儿所培养了干部。政府和人民对于父母们从南越带到北越来的孩子们给予非常细致的关怀。有将近二万儿童在北越上了学。河内的学校、医院和托儿所保留名额收受来自南越的儿童。
    得到和平幸福的生活和有着美好的前途的北越儿童，并没有忘记他们的现在还处在水深火热中的南越弟兄，他们以这样的歌唱，遥寄他们的同情和鼓励：
    我们幸福地生活在和平之中，
    自在地歌唱、学习。
    我们忘不了远方的朋友，
    他们面临不公平的遭受。
    但我们会聚集在一起，
    在我们统一的祖国的大家庭里，
    为了庆祝幸福生活，
    要在天堂种遍美丽的花朵。
    为了儿童，为了他们的现在和未来，越南的父母们更加感到有责任巩固越南民主共和国——越南和平和越南儿童幸福的基地——，在和平民主的基础上统一全国，为根据日内瓦协定实现全面选举而努力。
