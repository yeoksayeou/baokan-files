    How to Cultivate Industrial Cadres
    — A Trip to the Urals, Part 5
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    The more industrial enterprises I saw in the Urals, and the more people I met, the stronger a feeling became: that Soviet industry is equipped with such a large number of technically mature cadres who master the latest technology, apply it freely, and constantly improve it. Where did these strong cadre teams come from? After arriving in Sverdlovsk, the impressions gained along the way have formed an answer, although the impressions and answers are very incomplete.
    The first impression: Build factories and cultivate cadres in the production process.
    In the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine, skilled workers and technicians can be seen everywhere. There are several thousand engineers and technicians alone. This is the decisive factor that makes it the most advanced steel plant in the Soviet Union. The output of pig iron and steel per worker is three and a half times and more than twice the average output of all factories under the Soviet Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry, respectively. In other emerging steel plants in the Urals, cadres from Magnitogorsk can be encountered. However, the situation was not like this when the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant was first established. At that time, the problem of lacking a large number of skilled technical cadres to master new-style machinery was encountered. Stalin pointed out the way to solve this problem. Later, Stalin said at the reception of the delegation of metallurgical workers in 1934:
  “We have too few technical personnel in our country. We are faced with two paths that must be chosen: when schools have not yet trained technical cadres, first train personnel from technical schools, stop production for ten years, and put a large number of machines aside; or immediately start manufacturing machines, use machines extensively in the national economy, so as to train technical personnel and cultivate cadres in the process of production and use of machines. We chose the second path. We knew very well that due to the lack of technically trained personnel who are good at using machines, we would have to pay an unavoidable cost and extra expense. Indeed, we damaged a lot of machines during this period, but we won the most valuable time and cultivated the most valuable cadres in economic work.”
    In the Chelyabinsk Iron and Steel Plant, there is a famous fast steelmaking worker named Vasily Mokrinsky. He showed me the electric furnace he worked on and took me to his home. He created operating procedures for using oxygen to speed up the smelting of high-grade steel. The steelmaking team he led saved every minute on each operation, so it often took two hours less than the standard time to refine a furnace of steel. His family of three lives in two bright rooms. Although his monthly salary averages more than 3,000 rubles, his home still maintains the simplicity of the working class. Apart from books, necessary furniture, a radio, and a few pots of flowers, the rest of the furnishings are very simple. Many books are placed on the bookshelf. Among the literary books are works by Saltykov-Shchedrin, Chekhov, Gogol, Makarenko, Jack London, and other writers. Judging from his technical and cultural accomplishments, Mokrinsky should be someone who graduated from a higher or secondary school, right? No, you guessed wrong. Middle-aged Mokrinsky recalled his childhood and said: "I didn't go to school when I was young. A family of eight had only one horse and one cow. My father pushed the plow, and I drove the horse. My mother sometimes mentioned that the children should go to school, but my father said: Forget it. The family is poor, how can we afford to go to school?" Mokrinsky's technical and cultural level has been continuously improved in the long-term labor. He started as a ditch repairer in the Stalingrad Iron and Steel Plant, and during the war, he started as a third assistant steelmaker in Chelyabinsk, then as a second assistant, first assistant, and steelmaker. Since 1948, he has been leading the Stakhanovite Workers' School. Some of the workers he has helped have grown into steelmakers. Mokrinsky's experience is the most common path taken by Soviet workers.
    The second impression: Learning without leaving production is the main method to improve the cultural and technical level of employees.
    In Sverdlovsk, people at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant said: "One out of every two of our employees is studying." This refers to studying in technical training classes and even evening schools of engineering colleges without leaving production. The Party, administration, and trade union of the factory know that improving the cultural and technical level of employees is one of the decisive conditions for improving labor productivity, so they care about the employees' learning. A grand technical training hall was built next to the factory, with well-equipped lecture halls, research rooms, libraries, and 70,000 books. It has become the center of employees' learning and cultural activities. Employees study in many ways.
    Young Workers' Schools help workers who have not attended or completed middle school for various reasons to continue their secondary education during production. Five years ago, the factory used nearby middle schools to organize six Young Workers' Schools, where 1,620 workers studied. Later, the young people of the factory got their own school building, and the number of students increased to 2,000. When the new school building was completed in 1955, the number of students will increase by another 960.
    According to the needs of various workshops, various training classes are often held to improve the technical proficiency of workers. For example, in the machining workshop, the training class studies advanced metal cutting methods; in the foundry workshop, it studies how to improve product quality and reduce defective products.
    Every month, dozens of schools for promoting advanced experience work directly in the workshops. One or two hundred outstanding machine manufacturers teach their experience there. Thousands of workers participate in the study of this kind of school every year. The type of advanced experience school to be organized is decided by the foreman. Study is voluntary. This matter is managed by the cadre training section and the factory trade union committee. The factory director instructed the workshop director to supervise the work of this kind of school. After the recent All-Soviet Trade Union Congress, the factory frequently organizes experience exchange meetings for workers of the same profession. For example, a lathe operator experience exchange meeting was held in the technical training hall, in which lathe operators from various workshops participated.
    The foreman training class teaches workers the necessary knowledge for foreman's work. Every year, hundreds of workers graduate from the two-year foreman training class and from the foreman training class specializing in economics and production planning.
    Many workers participate in secondary technical schools in the machine manufacturing industry. It takes five years of study without leaving production. In 1954, sixty-three workers graduated from secondary technical schools and became technicians.
    Many technicians and engineers study at the Ural Polytechnic Institute's evening school, the correspondence courses of the Soviet Machine Building Institute, and other institutions of higher learning. Dozens of people graduate every year. In recent years, twenty people have obtained master's degrees in technology, and forty are currently writing their dissertations.
    After intense eight-hour work and other social activities, it naturally takes a lot of perseverance to study. However, employees' study without leaving production is more closely integrated with practical work, and plays a significant role in improving their working ability and developing their labor creative talent. Pavel Malofeyev was a
  ordinary concrete worker when the factory was being built. Later, he worked as a foreman and workshop director in the factory, while continuing to study constantly. He successively completed the evening school of the Secondary Technical School of Machine Manufacturing and the evening school of the Ural Polytechnic Institute, and now serves as the factory's chief mechanic. Due to persistent study without leaving production, Vilegzhanin gradually grew from a lathe operator to the factory's deputy director of production, Ivanov grew from a molder to the director of the casting workshop, and Kuryakin grew from a steelmaker to a designer.
    The situation of Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant employees studying without leaving production can be seen in other factories in the Urals and the Soviet Union.
    The third impression: Establishing industrial colleges near industrial enterprises, paying attention to the combination of learning and practical work.
    In Chernyakovsk, near Ufa, the Petroleum Institute was established in 1948. It was established with the development of the Soviet Union's eastern petroleum industry. It is built in the "Second Baku" area, near the oil refinery. The first group of students graduated in 1954. They work in the oil fields and oil factories of Bashkiria, and some also work on Sakhalin Island. There are 1,400 people studying at the college day and night. Students are in classrooms and laboratories during the day; workers who study without leaving production are there at night. The courses studied by the two classes are exactly the same, but the duration of study for the evening class is extended by one year.
    In various industrial centers in the Urals, there are many higher technical schools of this kind that are adapted to industry. The largest of these is the Ural Polytechnic Institute in Sverdlovsk. Dr. German Pruzhensky, the silver-haired president of the college, said to me: "The Ural Polytechnic Institute is relatively young, only twenty years old. It was built during the Second Five-Year Plan period, in
  1934. At that time, there were fewer than 2,000 students, but now there are 1,000 faculty and staff and 15,000 students, training engineers in 43 majors, supplying the needs of industry in the Urals and various parts of eastern Soviet Union." The scale of Ural industry can also be seen from this furnace that cultivates industrial technical cadres.
    To illustrate the role of the Ural Polytechnic Institute in Ural industry, a few facts are enough. Forty percent of the engineers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant are graduates of the Polytechnic Institute. The branch of the Polytechnic Institute established in this factory educates 700 students. The scientific staff of the Polytechnic Institute often cooperate with the staff of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Ural Carriage Manufacturing Plant, the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant, the Serov Iron and Steel Plant and other factories to solve many important technical problems, such as accelerating the cutting, smelting, and rolling production processes, improving the mechanization of production, and researching the production of new products.
    The Polytechnic Institute teaches students to combine learning with practice. There are many international students from our country and students from people's democratic countries in this college. When they are doing internships and designing graduation projects, the college always sends them to factories that are similar to the conditions in their home countries for internships, and guides them to design according to the situation in their home countries, so that they can serve their motherland well after returning home. Soviet students also pay attention to combining theory with practice. Three years ago, female student Liapina proposed that each student should do at least one thing that is beneficial to the college during their studies. In her pre-graduation internship, she studied the rationalization of the lathe operator's work and held a school to teach advanced experience, which increased the work efficiency of the lathe operator by 20 to 30 percent. Students from the Department of Architecture designed patterns for construction machinery stations, and they participated in construction work during their vacations.
    The Urals previously preserved a certain number of worker cadres who had accumulated some experience in metallurgy, metal processing, prospecting, and mining in the course of long-term work. During the period of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, these old cadres and a large number of new cadres armed with new achievements in science and technology were well integrated. This combination was a favorable condition for the development of industry in the Urals. But the basic industrial cadres of the Urals were cultivated after the start of the period of socialist industrialization.
    "Pay attention to cadres, train cadres, help backward people to learn technology, and cultivate talents who can master technology and promote technological development day by day." - Stalin's famous saying has been realized in the Urals, as in various regions of the Soviet Union, and is still being practiced today.

    怎样培养工业干部
    ——乌拉尔纪行之五
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    在乌拉尔，看到的工业企业越多，接触的人们越多，一种感觉也越强烈，这就是：苏联工业中配备着多么充足的技术成熟的干部，他们驾驭着最新的技术，把它运用自如，把它不断改进。这些雄厚的干部队伍是从那里来的呢？到了斯维尔德洛夫斯克以后，一路上所得的印象已能形成答案，虽然印象和答案是很不全面的。
    第一个印象：把工厂建设起来，在生产过程中培养干部。
    在马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂，到处可以见到熟练的工人和技术人员。仅仅工程师和技师就有几千人。这是决定的因素，使它成为苏联最先进的钢铁厂。它的每个工人出产的生铁和钢，分别为苏联钢铁工业部各工厂平均产量的三倍半和两倍多。在乌拉尔其他后起的钢铁厂，可以遇见由马格尼托哥尔斯克去的干部。但是，在开始建立马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂的时候，情形不是这样的。当时遇到了缺乏大批熟练的技术干部去掌握新式机器的问题。斯大林指示了解决这个问题的道路。后来斯大林在一九三四年冶金工作者代表团招待会上说：
  “我国技术人材太少。我们面前摆着必须加以抉择的两条路：当学校还没有培养出技术干部的时候，先从技术学校中训练人材，在十年之中把生产停顿下来，把大批机器搁置起来；或者立即开始制造机器，在国民经济中大量使用机器，以便在生产和使用机器的过程中训练技术人材，培养干部。我们选择了第二条道路。我们明明知道，由于缺少受过技术训练的善于使用机器的人材，因此便要付出一笔不可避免的费用和额外开支。的确，在这段时期我们损坏了不少机器，但我们却赢得了最宝贵的时间并在经济工作中培养了最有价值的干部。”
    在车里雅宾斯克钢铁工厂，有一位出名的快速炼钢工人瓦西里·莫克林斯基。他领我看了他工作的电炉，和到了他的家里。他创造了使用氧气加快冶炼高级钢的操作规程，他领导的炼钢组在每个操作上节约每分钟时间，所以炼一炉钢常常比标准时间缩短两个小时。他一家三口住着两个明亮的房间。虽然他每月工资平均有三千多卢布，他的家里仍然保持着工人阶级的朴素的作风，除了书籍，必要的家具、收音机和几盆花以外，其余的陈设也都很简单。书架上摆着许多书籍。在文学书籍中，有谢德林、契诃夫、果戈理、马卡连科、杰克·伦敦和其他作家的著作。照技术和文化修养来估计，莫克林斯基应该是出自高等或中等学校的门墙的人吧。不，你猜得不对。中年的莫克林斯基回忆起童年时代的情景说：“小的时候没有念书。一家八口，只有一匹马和一头母牛。父亲推犁，我赶马。母亲有时提起孩子要念书，父亲说：算了罢。家里穷，那还能念书呢？”莫克林斯基的技术和文化水平，是在长期劳动当中不断提高的。他起初是在斯大林格勒钢铁厂当修槽工，战时到车里雅宾斯克开始当炼钢第三助手，后来当第二助手，第一助手，炼钢工。他从一九四八年起，一直领导着斯塔哈诺夫工作者学校。在他帮助下的工人当中有些成长为炼钢工。莫克林斯基的经历，是苏联工人所走的最一般的道路。
    第二个印象：不脱离生产地学习，是提高职工文化和技术水平的主要方法。
    在斯维尔德洛夫斯克，乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的人们说：“我们每两个职工当中有一个在学习。”这是指不脱离生产地在技术训练班以至工学院夜校的学习。工厂的党、行政和工会知道，提高职工的文化和技术水平，是提高劳动生产率的决定性条件之一，所以关心着职工的学习。在工厂旁边建立了一座宏大的技术训练馆，那里有设备很好的讲堂、研究室、图书室和七万册藏书。它成为职工学习和文化活动的中心。职工们学习的方式很多。
    青年工人学校，帮助因为各种原因没有念过或者没有念完中学的工人在生产当中继续受完中等教育。五年以前，工厂利用附近中学校组织了六个青年工人学校，在那里学习的有一千六百二十名工人。后来工厂青年得到了自己的校舍，学习的人增加到二千。一九五五年新校舍落成时，学习的人还要增加九百六十名。
    按照各个车间的需要，经常举办各种提高工人的技术熟练程度的训练班。例如，在机械加工车间，训练班研究先进的金属切削方法；在铸造车间，它研究改进产品质量和减少废品问题。
    每月有几十个推广先进经验的学校，直接在车间工作着。一两百优秀的机器制造者在那里讲授自己的经验。每年参加这种学校学习的工人，数以千计。组织什么样的先进经验学校，由工长决定。学习是自愿的。这件事归干部培养科和工厂工会委员会管理。厂长责成车间主任监督这种学校的工作。在最近一次的全苏工会代表大会以后，工厂经常组织同一个专业的工人的经验交流会。例如，在技术训练馆举行了旋工经验交流会，各车间的旋工都参加。
    工长训练班，教给工人以工长工作的必要知识。每年有数以百计的工人从两年制的工长训练班毕业，从专门学习经济和生产计划的工长训练班毕业。
    许多工人参加机器制造业的中等技术学校。要坚持五年不脱离生产的学习。在一九五四年有六十三个工人从中等技术学校毕业，成为技师。
    技师和工程师当中很多人在乌拉尔工学院夜校，在苏联机器制造学院函授班和其他高等学校学习。一年有几十个人毕业。在最近几年中，有二十个人取得了技术硕士的学位，现在有四十人在写学位论文。
    在紧张的八小时工作和其他社会活动之后，还要学习，这自然需要不小的毅力。但是职工不脱离生产的学习，结合实际工作更密切，在提高他们的工作能力，和发展他们的劳动创造才干上，起着显著作用。巴维尔·马洛费也夫在建设工厂的时候是
  一个普通的混凝土工人。后来在工厂当工长、车间主任，同时坚持不断地学习。他先后念完了机器制造业中等技术学校夜校和乌拉尔工学院夜校，现在担任工厂的总机械师。由于坚持不脱离生产地学习，维列格张宁从旋工逐步地成长为工厂的生产副主任，伊凡诺夫从制模工人成长为铸型车间主任，库里雅金从炼钢工人成长为设计师。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂职工不脱离生产地学习的情形，在乌拉尔和苏联的其他工厂都可以见到。
    第三个印象：在靠近工业企业的地方开办工业学院，注意学习和实际工作的结合。
    在乌发附近的契尔尼雅科夫斯克，在一九四八年建立了石油学院。它是随着苏联东部石油工业的发展而建立的。它建立在“第二巴库”地区，在石油提炼工厂附近。在一九五四年毕业了第一批学生。他们在巴什基里亚的油田和油厂工作，也有的到库页岛工作。白天和夜晚在学院学习的有一千四百人。白天在课堂和实验室的是学生；夜晚，是不脱离生产地学习的工人。两班所学的课程，完全一样，不过晚班学习的期限拉长一年。
    在乌拉尔各个工业中心，这种同工业相适应的高等技术学校很多。其中规模最大的是在斯维尔德洛夫斯克的乌拉尔工学院。头发银白的院长格尔曼·普鲁真斯基博士对我说：“乌拉尔工学院比较年轻，才二十岁。它是在第二个五年计划时期，在
  一九三四年建成的。当时只有不到两千学生，而现在有一千教职员和一万五千学生，培养着四十三个专业的工程师，供应乌拉尔和苏联东部各地工业的需要。”从这座培养工业技术干部的洪炉，也可以看出乌拉尔工业的规模了。
    乌拉尔工学院在乌拉尔工业中的作用，举几个事实便够说明。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的工程师百分之四十是工学院的毕业生。工学院在这个工厂设立的分院，教育着七百个学生。工学院的科学工作人员经常和乌拉尔重型机器制造厂、乌拉尔车厢制造厂、新塔吉尔钢铁厂、西罗夫钢铁厂及其他工厂的职工合作解决许多重要的技术问题，如像加速切削、冶炼、辗轧的生产过程，提高生产的机械化，研究新产品的生产等等。
    工学院教导学生学习要结合实际。在这个学院有许多我国留学生，也有人民民主国家的学生。当他们实习和设计毕业图案的时候，学院总是派他们到同他们本国条件相近的工厂实习，指导他们根据本国的情况进行设计，以便他们回国后能很好地为祖国服务。苏联学生同样注意结合实际。三年以前女学生里雅平娜创议，每个学生在学习期间至少要做一件对学院有益的事情。她自己在毕业前的实习当中研究了旋工工作的合理化方法，举办了传授先进经验的学校，这使旋工的工作效率提高了百分之二、三十。建筑系的学生设计了建筑机器站的图案，他们在假期中参加了建筑工作。
    乌拉尔以前保存了一定数量的工人干部，他们在长期工作过程中在冶金、金属加工、探矿和采矿方面累积了一些经验。在苏联进行社会主义工业化时期，这些老干部和大批以科学加技术的新成就武装起来的新干部很好地结合了起来。这种结合是在乌拉尔发展工业的有利条件。但是乌拉尔工业干部基本是在社会主义工业化时期开始以后培养出来的。
    “注重干部，训练干部，帮助落后的人去学会技术，逐日培养出能够精通技术和推动技术发展的人材。”——斯大林的这句名言，在乌拉尔，正如在苏联各个地区一样，被实现了，今天还被继续实行着。
