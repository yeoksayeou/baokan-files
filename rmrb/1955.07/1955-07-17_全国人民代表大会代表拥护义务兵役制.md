Deputies attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, including prominent industrial and agricultural labor models, representatives of people's organizations, educators, writers, and combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army, after hearing Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's report on the draft "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," unanimously agreed that it is timely and correct to enact this law and implement an obligatory military service system to replace the volunteer system. Representatives of the People's Liberation Army further used specific examples to illustrate that implementing the obligatory military service system is an urgent need for national defense construction.

Industrial labor model Zhu Shunyu said: "I believe that workers across the country, like me, will enthusiastically support the implementation of the obligatory military service system to strengthen national defense. Implementing the obligatory military service system will be of great significance to our country's industrial construction, because this system will allow us to appropriately reduce the number of active-duty troops in peacetime, saving a large amount of manpower and material resources to concentrate on the nation's industrial construction endeavors."

Agricultural labor model Guo Yu'en said: "After the implementation of the obligatory military service system, the country can prepare a large number of reserve soldiers who have received military training. Young people can take turns going to the army to learn the skills to defend the country, which is a very good thing. Young people who join the army can greatly improve their political awareness after a few years in the military, and everyone is welcome when they return to participate in construction. Our 'May 1st' Agricultural Production Cooperative has several demobilized soldiers who serve as accountants, production team leaders, and group leaders, and they are all doing a great job. As more and more demobilized soldiers return, they will be of increasing help to local work."

Military dependent representative and model military dependent Shen Jilan said: "Implementing the obligatory military service system is 'three satisfactions'—the country is satisfied, the individuals are satisfied, and the masses are satisfied. After the young people in the family join the army, the masses respect the military dependents, and the military dependents are glorious. However, glory is glory, and labor is labor. We cannot be unwilling to work because of glory. Precisely because the military dependents are glorious, we must actively participate in labor and increase production. Only in this way can we be truly glorious and promote our country's construction."

"Mother of the Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu said: "The military service law is the fairest and most reasonable. Everyone has a responsibility to defend the motherland, and every eligible person should serve in the military. When recruiting supplementary soldiers this spring, many young people enthusiastically signed up, but a few were unwilling to go, mainly because they did not understand the significance of military service. I will continue to promote it well when I return."

Huang Jiguang's mother, Deng Fangzhi, said: "There are so many benefits to the military service law. Serving for three or four years, one can defend the motherland and learn skills at the same time. After serving the term and returning home, one will have culture, skills, and improved political awareness. In the army, they are heroes defending the motherland; after returning home, they are capable people building the motherland." She also said excitedly: "My fourth son turned eighteen this year. He joined the army this spring and has made great progress in the past six months. He not only studies hard in the army but also wrote to me to urge me to run the cooperative better."

Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo said: "Today, our country wants to build a strong national defense force, and we must have not only a strong active force but also a strong, well-trained reserve force, which can only be achieved by implementing the obligatory military service system. Only by implementing the obligatory military service system can we save manpower and financial resources and concentrate our efforts on socialist industrial construction. Our country needs peace, and we do not need to expand our army. We fully support the Soviet government's proposal to reduce armaments. As Minister of Education, I hope that students in senior high schools and schools equivalent to senior high schools across the country, in addition to studying hard, should also receive pre-enlistment military training on campus, work hard to exercise their bodies, and prepare to contribute their strength to defend the motherland."

Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Hu Yaobang said: "The discussion and passage of the military service law will arouse a high tide of patriotism among young people across the country. Chinese youth deeply understand that to build the motherland, we must first strengthen national defense. The implementation of the military service law further guarantees the security of the motherland and also creates better opportunities for patriotic youth to serve the motherland. Chinese youth should inherit the past patriotic traditions, work hard to exercise their bodies, and actively fulfill the glorious obligation of serving in the military. Youth League organizations at all levels should assist local Party organizations and people's committees in strengthening the publicity of the military service law."

Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation Rong Gaotang said: "Today, our country implements the obligatory military service system, which is a further expression of the common aspirations and firm will of our people to defend the motherland, defend peace, and oppose imperialist aggression. I believe that Chinese youth should not only improve their political level and scientific and technological knowledge in the future but also improve their physical health. I hope that young people will widely carry out mass sports activities and participate in national defense sports activities, work hard to exercise their bodies, so as to prepare to fulfill the glorious obligation of serving in the military and shoulder the sacred duty of defending the motherland."

Writer Liu Baiyu said excitedly, holding Minister Peng Dehuai's report: "This is a solemn call to the people of the whole country. The implementation of the military service law can better defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory; the military service law is organically combined with the Five-Year Plan; as a literary worker, once the motherland calls me in the future, I should immediately go to the forefront of defending the motherland. In the literary work post, one of my responsibilities is to praise our revolutionary soldiers, praise the glorious army, and praise the heroic people of our country, so that the people of the motherland will receive patriotic education. This has not been done well enough in the past, and we should work harder in the future."

Liu Meicun, a representative of the People's Liberation Army from the border of the motherland, said: "After the implementation of the obligatory military service system, the old soldiers who volunteered to join the army in the past can gradually retire and transfer to the reserve. Their family, marriage, and other issues can be reasonably resolved. Many young people who want to serve in the military can also take turns to fulfill their obligation to defend the motherland by serving in the military."

Zhang Ming, the famous commander of the Luoyang Heroic Battalion, said: "When Hitler launched a frenzied invasion of the Soviet Union, one of the important factors for the Soviet Union's ability to quickly drive the German bandits out of Soviet territory and win the Great Patriotic War was that the Soviet Union had implemented an obligatory military service system for many years, accumulating a strong, well-trained reserve force. The Soviet Union's experience is very valuable to us. Our country can only quickly implement the obligatory military service system and accumulate a strong, well-trained reserve force in order to crush possible imperialist invasions at any time."

Jiang Xueshan, representative of the "Tashan Heroic Regiment" commander, emphasized: "Our implementation of obligatory military service is only to defend the motherland. In the past few years, our country has demobilized more than four million people, which is proof of our country's love of peace. However, if the imperialists dare to invade our country, our people's army will simply eliminate them."

### 全国人民代表大会代表拥护义务兵役制

    全国人民代表大会代表拥护义务兵役制
    出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的代表，著名的工农业劳动模范、人民团体代表、教育家、作家等代表和人民解放军的战斗英雄，听了彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告以后，一致认为现在制定这个法律以实行义务兵役制来代替志愿兵制是适时的，正确的。人民解放军的代表们，更用具体事例说明实行义务兵役制是国防建设上的迫切需要。
    工业劳动模范朱顺余说：我相信全国的工人和我一样，都会十分热烈地拥护实行义务兵役制，加强国防力量。实行义务兵役制对我国工业建设将有很大的关系，因为这个制度将使我们在平时适当地减少现役军队人数，节省出大批人力物力，集中在国家的工业建设事业上。
    农业劳动模范郭玉恩说：实行了义务兵役制以后，可以给国家准备很多的经过军事训练的预备兵员，青年人可以轮流地到部队中学习保卫国防的本领，这真是很好的事情。参军青年在部队待几年，政治思想都会有很大提高，回来参加建设，大家都很欢迎。我们“五一”农业生产合作社就有几个复员军人，他们担任了会计、生产队长、组长等职务，都工作得很好。以后复员军人越来越多，对地方工作的帮助也会越来越大。
    军属代表、模范军属申纪兰说：实行义务兵役制是三满意——国家满意、自己满意、群众满意。家里的青年参军以后，群众对军属很尊重，军属是很光荣的。可是，光荣是光荣，劳动是劳动，不能因为光荣，就不愿意劳动，正是因为军属光荣，我们更要积极参加劳动，增加生产。这样，才是真正的光荣，才会推进我们国家的建设。
    “子弟兵的母亲”戎冠秀说：兵役法是最公平合理的，保卫祖国人人都有责任，每一个适龄的人都应该服兵役。今春征集补充兵员时，很多青年都踊跃报名，但也有少数人不肯去，主要是对服兵役的意义不了解，这次回去还要很好地宣传。
    黄继光的母亲邓芳芝说：“兵役法的好处真是多得很，服役三、四年，一面保卫祖国，一面学习本领。服役期满回家后，有文化，有技术，政治觉悟也提高了。在军队里是保卫祖国的英雄，回家后就是建设祖国的能手了。她还很兴奋地说：我的第四个儿子今年整十八岁，春天去服兵役后，半年来已有很大进步。他不仅自己在部队里好好地学习，还写信要我把合作社办得更好。”
    教育部长张奚若说：今天我们国家要建设强大的国防力量，不仅要有强大的现役兵员，还要有雄厚的训练有素的预备役兵员，这只有实行义务兵役制才能办到。也只有实行义务兵役制，才可以节省出人力财力，集中力量用在社会主义工业建设上。我们国家是需要和平的，我们并不需要扩充军队，我们完全拥护苏联政府关于裁减军备的建议。做为教育部长，我希望全国高级中学和相当于高级中学的学校的学生，除应努力学习外，还应当在校内受征集前的军事训练，努力锻炼身体，为保卫祖国而准备贡献自己的力量。
    青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦说：兵役法的讨论、通过，将激起全国青年的爱国主义的高潮。中国青年深深懂得，要建设祖国，必须首先加强国防。兵役法的实施，进一步保证了祖国安全，也为爱国青年的为祖国效力创造了更好的机会，中国青年当继承过去的爱国主义传统，努力锻炼身体，积极履行服兵役的光荣义务。各级青年团组织应该协助各地党组织和人民委员会，加强关于兵役法的宣传。
    中华全国体育总会委员会副主席荣高棠说：今天我们国家实行义务兵役制，这是我国人民保卫祖国、保卫和平、反对帝国主义侵略的共同愿望和坚强意志的进一步表示。我认为我国青年今后除应提高政治水平和科学技术知识外，要更好地提高身体健康水平。我希望青年们广泛地开展群众性体育活动和参加国防体育活动，努力锻炼身体，以准备履行服兵役的光荣义务，担负起保卫祖国的神圣职责。
    作家刘白羽拿着彭德怀部长的报告激动地说：这是对全国人民的一个庄严的号召。实施了兵役法，可以更好地保卫革命胜利果实；兵役法对五年计划是有机的结合；作为一个文学工作者，今后一旦祖国召唤我，我当立即走上保卫祖国的最前线。在文学工作岗位上，我的责任之一是歌颂我们的革命战士，歌颂光荣的军队，歌颂英雄的我国人民。使祖国人民从而受到爱国主义教育。这方面过去做得不够，今后当加倍努力。
    来自守卫祖国边疆的人民解放军代表刘梅村说：实行义务兵役制以后，过去志愿参军的老战士就可以逐渐地退伍转入预备役。他们的家庭、婚姻等问题就可以得到合理的解决。许多要求服兵役的青年，也就可以轮流履行自己保卫祖国服兵役的义务。
    著名的洛阳英雄营营长张明说：希特勒向苏联发动疯狂侵略时，伟大的苏联所以能够很快地把德寇逐出苏联领土，取得伟大卫国战争的胜利，重要因素之一就是因为苏联多年实行义务兵役制，积蓄了强大的训练有素的预备役兵员。苏联的这种经验对我们是十分宝贵的。我们国家只有迅速实行义务兵役制，积蓄强大的训练有素的预备役兵员，才能随时粉碎帝国主义可能的侵犯。
    “塔山英雄团”团长江雪山代表强调说：我们实行义务兵役只是为了保卫祖国，几年来我国就复员了四百多万人，这是我们国家爱好和平的明证。但是，如果帝国主义胆敢侵略我国，我们人民军队就要把他们干脆消灭。
