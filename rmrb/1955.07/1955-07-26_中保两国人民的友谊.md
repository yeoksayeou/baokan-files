    The Friendship Between the Chinese and Bulgarian People
    Bulgaria Er·Spiridonov
    Thousands of miles of continents and oceans stretch between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria. However, geographical distance cannot stop the road of fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two democratic countries.
    The Bulgarian people have been extremely concerned about the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and cheered for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Churchill painfully called this victory "a disaster" and "the greatest misfortune" suffered by imperialism since the end of World War II. This victory meant that China, with its 600 million people, stood on the side of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and carried out a joint struggle for socialism and world peace.
    The Bulgarian people are also pleased with the warm fraternal friendship shown by the Chinese people. This friendship is reflected in the reply of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, when the Bulgarian Ambassador to China presented his credentials on September 30, 1950, "There is a deep friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples." Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese people have always been deeply concerned and admired by the heroic struggle of the Bulgarian people under the leadership of the great leader Dimitrov against domestic and foreign reactionaries, as well as their current achievements in economic and cultural construction."
    Comprehensive economic, political and cultural cooperation, and the common struggle of the Bulgarian and Chinese people for prosperity, peace and socialism, are vivid illustrations of the fraternal friendship between the two countries.
    In the past, Bulgaria and China—both backward countries relying on imperialist aggressors—had no opportunity to establish long-term economic or any other relations. At the same time, the governments of China and Bulgaria, which relied on imperialism, did nothing to expand relations between the two countries.
    The situation is completely different now. Revolutionary reforms have transformed China and Bulgaria into independent countries with prosperous economies and cultures. Currently, Bulgaria is an industrial-agricultural country with developed heavy industry, a dominant mechanized agriculture, and growing export possibilities—in which industrial products account for a larger proportion than agricultural products. The huge economic development of the People's Republic of China has also promoted its export and import possibilities.
    Guided by the desire for brotherly cooperation in their common economic interests, the two countries signed their first trade agreement in history in July 1952. This was closely followed by a second trade agreement in December 1952 and a third in 1953. China supplies Bulgaria with tung oil, cotton, raw silk, rubber, bristles, tea, and non-ferrous metals, and receives agricultural and metal-cutting machinery, electrical machinery products, chemicals, and artificial fertilizers from Bulgaria. At the end of 1954, the trade agreement for 1955 was signed. The signing of this agreement is based on the needs of the planned economies of the two countries and to further expand trade between the two countries.
    The Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation signed on March 23 this year is a new and important step towards consolidating economic cooperation between Bulgaria and China. The agreement stipulates that the two countries will exchange experiences in various sectors of the national economy, exchange technical documents, and send experts to each other.
    Cultural relations between the Bulgarian and Chinese people are also constantly developing. Only today, having gained freedom, do the people of our two countries have the opportunity to promote cultural relations. The five-year cultural agreement signed by China and Bulgaria in Sofia in July 1952 marked the beginning of systematic, organized and planned cultural cooperation between the two countries. The agreement stipulates close cooperation between the Academies of Sciences of the two countries, other scientific research and cultural institutions, the exchange of scientific materials and publications, the exchange of books, periodicals, films and musical works, mutual visits by scientific and artistic circles, and the holding of exhibitions in the two countries to introduce culture, art and construction. In October 1953, the two countries signed a broadcasting cooperation agreement in Beijing.
    The Bulgarian people are very interested in the rich cultural heritage of the great Chinese people. This is the first time they have been able to have the opportunity to understand the great Chinese culture with thousands of years of history. Literary works from the new China are eagerly read in Bulgaria, and the appearance of many translations of modern Chinese writers' works is a good illustration. Zhao Shuli's novels are the most widely circulated. "The Floor," "Fugui," "Little Manager" and his other works have been translated. Bulgarian readers are also familiar with works such as Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane" and Mao Dun's "Midnight" and so on. Selected Works of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, have also been published in Bulgaria.
    Chinese art is no longer unfamiliar to the Bulgarian people. The performances of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe in Bulgaria allowed the Bulgarian working people to see the novel and ingenious Chinese musical art. Tens of thousands of viewers watched the Chinese films "Steel Soldier," "The White Haired Girl," and "People's Warrior." The Chinese exhibitions held in our country, such as "New China in Peace Construction" (1952), "Chinese New Year Pictures" (1953), "Chinese Decorative Art" and Li Binghong Painting Exhibition (1954), attracted a large audience.
    The Chinese people have also shown their love for the Bulgarian people and their culture. The works of Ivan Vazov, Yordan Yovkov, Hristo Vachev, Hristo Smirnenski, Nikola Vaptsarov and other writers as well as the leader of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, have been translated into Chinese. Bulgarian films "Alarm Clock," "Morning of the Motherland," "Under Oppression" and other films are also shown in Chinese cinemas. The performance of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army, which recently visited China, was warmly praised by the Chinese people, who expressed their brotherly friendship to the Bulgarian people.
    According to the cultural agreement, the cultural cooperation between China and Bulgaria is also reflected in many other ways. Sofia University has opened Chinese language classes under the leadership of Professor Zhu Dexi. Young Chinese men and women are studying in Bulgarian universities, and Bulgarian youth are studying in Chinese universities. The Chinese poet Qu Yuan and writer Lu Xun are respected in Bulgaria, and China also held meetings to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of Hristo Smirnenski and the 10th anniversary of the murder of Vaptsarov. Scientists, artists and trade union workers from both sides often visit each other.
    The firm friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people is manifested in their close political cooperation as members of the powerful democratic and socialist camp under the common policy of safeguarding peace.
    The Bulgarian people wholeheartedly congratulate the great Chinese people on their achievements and fully sympathize with their heroic struggle for socialism, for the unity of the people of the whole country, and for the maintenance of peace in Asia. In this struggle, the Chinese people are supported by all democratic countries. The provocations of the American war-mongers against the People's Republic of China, their attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs by preventing the liberation of Taiwan and making it a colony and springboard, are completely unreasonable.
    The Bulgarian people and the people of all democratic countries in Europe are happy to have the brotherly support of the 600 million Chinese people in the struggle to maintain peace and security in Europe. These countries welcomed with great satisfaction the statement of the Chinese representatives at the historic Moscow Conference; this statement indicated that the Chinese people are not indifferent onlookers of European affairs, and that they will fully support the struggle of the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries to maintain peace and ensure European security.
    The Sino-Bulgarian friendship is a solid link in the unbreakable chain of brotherly friendship that links the liberated people of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and it is also a guarantee for the final victory of the world's forces of peace and progress over the forces of aggression and reaction.

    中保两国人民的友谊
    保加利亚  尔·斯皮里多诺夫
    千万里的大陆和海洋伸延在中华人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国之间。但是，地理上的距离并不能阻挡住两个民主国家间兄弟友谊和全面合作的道路。
    保加利亚人民曾极为关心地注视着中国人民解放军的胜利进军，并为中国人民革命的胜利而欢呼。邱吉尔痛心地把这个胜利称作是自从第二次世界大战结束以来帝国主义所遭受的“一场灾难”和“最大的不幸”。这个胜利意味着拥有六万万人口的中国站到了伟大的苏联和人民民主国家的一边，为社会主义和世界和平而进行共同的斗争。
    保加利亚人民也对中国人民所表现出的热情的兄弟友谊而感到高兴。这种友情反映在保加利亚驻中国大使一九五○年九月三十日呈递国书时，中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的答辞里，“中保两国人民间是存在着深厚友谊的。”毛泽东主席说：“保加利亚人民在伟大领袖季米特洛夫领导下对内外反动派进行英勇斗争的事迹，以及目前经济、文化建设上的成就，一向为中国人民所深切关怀与钦佩。”
    经济、政治和文化上的全面合作，保加利亚人民和中国人民为繁荣、和平和社会主义而进行的共同斗争，就是两国间兄弟友谊生动的说明。
    过去，保加利亚和中国——两个都是依靠帝国主义侵略者的落后国家——没有机会建立长久的经济或任何其他关系。同时，中国和保加利亚的依靠帝国主义的政府也没为扩大两国间的关系作过任何事情。
    现在的情景已经完全不同了。革命的改革，已把中国和保加利亚改变成为具有繁荣的经济和文化的独立国家了。目前，保加利亚是一个有着发达的重工业、占优势的机械化农业和输出可能性——其中工业品的比重大于农产品——不断增长着的工业——农业国。中华人民共和国经济上的巨大发展，也促进了它出口和进口的可能性。
    在他们的共同经济利益中的兄弟般合作愿望的引导下，促使两国在一九五二年七月签订了他们历史上的第一个贸易协定。紧跟着在一九五二年十二月签订了第二个和在一九五三年签订了第三个贸易协定。中国供给保加利亚桐油、棉花、生丝、橡胶、猪鬃、茶叶、非黑色金属，从保加利亚得到农业和金属切削机器、电气机械产品、化学用品和人造肥料。在一九五四年底签订了一九五五年度的贸易协定。这项协定的签订是根据着两国计划经济中的需要，并为了要进一步扩大两国间的贸易事业。
    今年三月二十三日签订的科学技术合作协定，是走向巩固保加利亚和中国经济合作的一个新的重要步骤。协定规定，两国将交换国民经济各部门的经验，交换技术文件，并互派专家。
    保加利亚人民和中国人民之间的文化关系，也在不断地发展。只有在获得自由的今天，我们两国人民才有机会促进文化上的关系。一九五二年七月中国和保加利亚在索非亚签订的为期五年的文化协定，标志着两国之间有系统、有组织和有计划的文化合作的开始。协定规定，两国科学院、其他科学研究和文化机构间的紧密合作，交换科学材料和出版物，互换书籍、期刊、影片和音乐作品，科学和艺术界的相互访问，在两国相互举办介绍文化、艺术和建设情况的展览会。一九五三年十月两国又在北京签订了一项广播合作协定。
    保加利亚人民对于伟大中国人民丰富的文化遗产十分感到兴趣。他们这还是第一次能够有机会认识到具有数千年历史的伟大中国文化。新中国的文学作品在保加利亚被渴望地阅读着，现代中国作家的作品的许多译本的出现就是很好的说明。赵树理的小说流传得最为普遍。“地板”、“福贵”、“小经理”和他的其他作品都已被翻译过来。保加利亚读者也熟悉那样的一些作品，例如丁玲的“太阳照在桑干河上”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”和茅盾的“子夜”等等。中国人民领袖毛泽东的选集，也在保加利亚出版。
    中国艺术对保加利亚人民说来，不再是生疏的了。中国青年文工团在保加利亚的演出，使保加利亚劳动人民看到了新颖、巧妙的中国音乐艺术。成千成万的观众观看了中国影片“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“人民的战士”。在我国举行的中国展览会，例如“和平建设中的新中国”（一九五二年），“中国新年画”（一九五三年），“中国装饰艺术”和黎冰鸿绘画展览会（一九五四年）都吸引了广大群众。
    中国人民也表现出对保加利亚人民和他们的文化的喜爱。依凡·伐佐夫，约尔旦·岳符科夫，赫列斯托·瓦切夫，赫列斯托·斯米尔宁斯基，尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫和其他作家以及保加利亚人民领袖格奥尔基·季米特洛夫的作品都已经译成了中文。保加利亚的影片“警钟”，“祖国的早晨”，“在压迫下”以及其他影片也在中国的影院放映。不久前访问了中国的保加利亚人民军歌舞团的演出，受到中国人民的热烈称赞，他们表现了对保加利亚人民的兄弟般的友谊。
    根据文化协定，中国和保加利亚的文化合作还表现在其他的许多方式上面。索非亚大学在朱德熙教授的领导下开设了中文班。中国的男女青年在保加利亚的高等学校学习，保加利亚的青年在中国的大学里学习。中国诗人屈原和作家鲁迅在保加利亚受到尊敬，而且赫列斯托·斯米尔宁斯基逝世三十周年和瓦普察洛夫被害十周年时，中国也开会纪念了他们。双方的科学家、艺术家和工会工作者们经常相互访问。
    保中两国人民的牢固友谊，表现在他们作为强大的民主和社会主义阵营的成员，在共同维护和平政策下的紧密政治合作。
    保加利亚人民衷心祝贺伟大中国人民的成就，并且十分同情他们为社会主义、为全国人民的团结和为维护亚洲和平所作的英勇斗争。在这项斗争中，中国人民受到一切民主国家的支援。美国战争贩子对中华人民共和国的挑衅，他们想用阻止解放台湾并使之成为殖民地与跳板而干涉中国内政的企图，是十分无理的。
    保加利亚人民和所有欧洲民主国家的人民，都因为在维护欧洲和平和安全的斗争中得到六亿中国人民的兄弟般的支持而感到高兴。这些国家十分满意地欢迎中国代表在具有历史意义的莫斯科会议上的声明；这个声明表示，中国人民并不是欧洲事务的漠不关心的旁观者，他们将以全力来支持苏联和欧洲人民民主国家为维护和平和保证欧洲安全而进行的斗争。
    保中友谊是连结着苏联和中华人民共和国所领导的社会主义阵营中解放了的人民的兄弟友谊的牢不可破锁链中的一个坚固环节，它也是世界和平进步力量取得对侵略和反动力量最后胜利的一个保证。
