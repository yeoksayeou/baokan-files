Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Railway system design workers are intensifying the revision of engineering designs that have not yet been constructed this year, as well as some engineering designs that have already been constructed but can still be partially modified, in accordance with the requirements and technical measures for saving funds set forth by the Ministry of Railways. It is estimated that after the revision of various designs, approximately 100.4 million yuan can be saved.

The various design sub-bureaus under the Design General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have actively engaged in this work. The Northwest Design Sub-bureau is studying design principles and standards, formulating detailed rules for reducing engineering costs based on the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, and has concentrated one-sixth of its technical personnel on revising designs. The North China Design Sub-bureau has dispatched two special teams to the site for investigation in order to make the design revisions more practical.

Many railway engineering designs have saved large amounts of funds after being revised. When the employees responsible for constructing the Fengsha Railway received instructions from the Ministry of Railways on reducing engineering costs at the end of June, only a dozen kilometers of track laying remained on the Fengsha Railway. However, they immediately proceeded with construction according to the new design standards stipulated by the Ministry of Railways, saving timber, ballast, spikes, etc., worth 160,000 yuan on just those dozen kilometers of track. The designs for some station yards and housing projects left over after the completion of the Fengsha Railway track laying project have been modified, which can save approximately 2 million yuan. On this line, more than 2,900 square meters of offices, warehouses, iron workshops, etc., which were originally planned to be built, were canceled due to the use of temporary sheds. Many unreasonable and extravagant parts of the unfinished engineering designs for the Ji'er Railway have also been modified, and the total state investment in the Ji'er Railway can be reduced by approximately 10 million yuan. The design of the Jining Station on the Ji'er Railway has been revised for the second time. The original design of the building has been changed from a multi-story building to a single-story building, and the original "large roof" has been changed to a flat roof. Many decorations such as "parapet walls," "gold dots," and "Bawangzhang" have been canceled, reducing the engineering cost from the initial 127 yuan per square meter to 75 yuan. The total investment in the entire station has been reduced from 340,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan. After the design of the Erenhot Station was revised, the state's investment in this station was also reduced from 320,000 yuan to 137,000 yuan.

### 铁路系统设计部门加紧修改工程设计  节约的建设资金可达一亿多元

    铁路系统设计部门加紧修改工程设计
    节约的建设资金可达一亿多元
    新华社十二日讯　铁路系统设计工作者正在按照铁道部订出的节约资金的要求和技术措施，加紧修改今年度还没有施工的工程设计和一些虽已施工还能作部分修改的工程设计。预计各项设计修改以后，大约可以节约资金一亿零四百万元。
    铁道部设计总局所属各个设计分局都已积极投入这个工作。西北设计分局正在研究设计原则和标准，根据铁道部指示拟出降低工程造价的细则，并且集中了全局六分之一的技术人员在修改设计。华北设计分局已经派了两个专门小组到现场去调查，以便把设计修改得更加切合实际。
    许多铁路工程的设计经过修改以后，节约了大批资金。负责修建丰沙铁路的职工在六月底接到铁道部关于降低工程造价的指示时，丰沙铁路的铺轨工程只剩下十几公里。但是他们立刻按铁道部规定的新设计标准施工，仅在十几公里线路上，就节约了价值十六万元的枕木、道碴、道钉等。丰沙铁路铺轨工程完成后所剩下的一些站场和房屋工程的设计，都作了修改，大约能节省二百万元左右。这条线路上由于利用临时工棚因而取消修建的办公室、仓库、铁工房等有二千九百多平方公尺。集二线没有完成的工程设计中许多不合理和铺张浪费部分也已作了修改，国家对集二线的总投资大约可以减少一千万元左右。集二线的集宁车站的设计这次作了第二次的修改，原设计的楼房改为平房，原来的“大屋顶”改为平顶，许多装饰品如“女儿墙”“金点”“霸王掌”等都取消后，工程造价由最初的每平方公尺一百二十七元降低到七十五元，整个车站的投资由三十四万元削减为十一万元。二连车站的设计修改以后，国家对这个站的投资也由三十二万元降低为十三万七千元。
