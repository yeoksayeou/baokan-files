Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th - According to TASS reports quoting newspaper sources, opposition parties led by the Masjumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party are attempting to create a government crisis. The Indonesian Socialist Party's organ, "Kompas," has called for the government to resign.

The opposition and senior military officers led by Colonel Lubis have been opposing the government's appointment of General Udojo (one of the most capable leaders in the struggle against Dutch colonialism) as Army Chief of Staff for some time. Some opposition members of parliament have introduced a motion of no confidence in Defense Minister Kusumasoemantri in parliament.

On the evening of the 12th, President Sukarno held talks with Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and Deputy Prime Minister Arifin to discuss the current situation.

To complicate the situation, the opposition in parliament is also undermining certain other government measures. Due to the obstruction of opposition members, the vote in the National Assembly on approving the bill to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Union Statute has been repeatedly postponed. Foreign Minister Sunarjo pointed out that the delay in approving this bill is detrimental to the country's national interests. Analyzing this situation, the "Independent" newspaper pointed out: "The opposition's actions harm the interests of the people, and their purpose is to eliminate the people's democratic rights."

The National Council of the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor issued a statement calling on the people to defend their democratic rights. The statement said: "All the working people of Indonesia unanimously oppose any form of military dictatorship, because it violates the Constitution of the Republic."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th - According to Antara News Agency, the People's Youth League of Indonesia issued a statement on the 13th, saying that the People's Youth League opposes any presidential cabinet with a tendency towards military dictatorship. The People's Youth League stands shoulder to shoulder with other democratic groups in supporting the Sastroamidjojo government and fighting against any forces that are anti-parliamentary, anti-democratic, or violate the national constitution.

The statement said that as a revolutionary youth mass organization, the People's Youth League fully shares the responsibility of safeguarding parliamentary democracy and strives for the complete success of the struggle to hold general elections.

The statement said that the sincere support given to the Sastroamidjojo government is based on the progressiveness it has shown compared to previous governments.

The statement said that the reactionary groups are trying to exacerbate the crisis in the army caused by the appointment of the new Army Chief of Staff, with the aim of forcing the establishment of a presidential cabinet inclined towards military dictatorship.

The statement called on all democracy-loving youth in Indonesia to strengthen and expand unity and maintain high vigilance for the benefit of the successful holding of general elections and for the benefit of defending and expanding democracy and freedom.

    印度尼西亚总工会和人民青年团分别发表声明
    表示支持政府并反对任何形式的军事独裁
    新华社十四日讯  据塔斯社雅加达十三日讯：据报纸消息，以马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党为首的反对党派企图制造政府危机。印度尼西亚社会党的机关报“指南针报”要求政府辞职。
    反对派和以卢比斯上校为首的高级军官反对政府任命乌多约将军（反对荷兰殖民者的斗争中最能干的领导者之一）为陆军参谋长，已有好些时候了。一些反对派议员在议会中提出了对国防部长库素马素曼特里表示不信任的议案。
    十二日晚上，苏加诺总统同沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和阿里芬副总理举行会谈，商讨当前的局势。
    议会中的反对派为了使局势复杂化，还破坏政府的其他某些措施。由于反对派议员的阻挠，国会关于批准废除荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦议定书法案的表决，一再地延期举行。外交部长苏纳约指出，这个法案迟迟没有批准，给国家的民族利益带来了损害。“独立报”分析这种局势时指出：“反对派的行动损害人民的利益，其目的在于消灭人民的民主权利。”
    印度尼西亚总工会全国理事会发表声明，号召人民保卫自己的民主权利。声明说：“印度尼西亚全体劳动人民一致地反对任何形式的军事独裁，因为这是违反共和国宪法的。”
    新华社雅加达十四日电据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚青年组织人民青年团十三日发表声明说，人民青年团反对任何有军事独裁趋势的总统内阁。人民青年团和其他民主团体并肩一起支持沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府，对任何反国会和反民主性质或违反国家宪法的势力进行斗争。
    声明说，作为革命青年群众组织，人民青年团充分分担维护国会民主的责任，并且为争取举行普选的斗争取得圆满成果而努力。
  声明说，给予沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府的真诚支持，是基于这个政府比起以前的各届政府来所表现的进步性。
    声明说，反动集团企图使陆军中由于任命新的陆军参谋长而产生的危机恶化，其目的在于强制成立趋向于军事独裁的总统内阁。
    声明号召印度尼西亚所有爱好民主的青年，为了成功地举行普选的利益，为了保卫和扩大民主和自由的利益，加强和扩大团结，并且保持高度的警惕性。
