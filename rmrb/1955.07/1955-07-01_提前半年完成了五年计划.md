　　Five-Year Plan Completed Half a Year Ahead of Schedule
　　By Our Correspondent in Moscow　Lǐ Hé
    June 24th was a grand festival for the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory. On this day, a car produced on the assembly line in the assembly workshop was adorned with a flag that read: "Car Completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan."
    One of the largest automobile manufacturing plants in the Soviet Union has completed its Fifth Five-Year Plan! This is the result of the patriotic, selfless labor of all the employees of the Stalin Automobile Factory. They, along with the collectives of twelve other advanced industrial enterprises in Moscow, launched a socialist competition to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule on the eve of the October Revolution anniversary last year. At that time, the Stalin Automobile Factory workers guaranteed to complete the five-year total output plan in July of this year. Now, this guarantee has been realized ahead of schedule. They completed the five-year plan in terms of total output six months and six days ahead of schedule.
    All the employees of the Stalin Automobile Factory have maintained long-term, unremitting labor enthusiasm, so the factory's output has increased year by year. If the output in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 101.5 in 1951, 118.4 in 1952, 135.1 in 1953, 154.1 in 1954, and 164 in the first five months of 1955. This overall achievement is inseparable from the diligent efforts of every employee in the factory. Several thousand workers in the factory have completed their individual five-year plan tasks, and hundreds of workers have completed two five-year plan quotas. Turner Bushuyev, who had been to China, as well as Popkov and Mokhov, completed twelve to thirteen years' worth of quotas during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Popkov said: "My workload is rarely lower than four quotas, and sometimes reaches eight quotas. Many of us are working like this." In four years and five months, the adoption of 62,000 rationalization proposals put forward by employees in production saved the state more than 145 million rubles.
    Last spring and this spring, a total of more than 600 young employees from various workshops of the factory volunteered to go to Altai and Kazakhstan to support the reclamation of wasteland. The factory had to produce new products in large quantities—bicycles and electric water tanks—and greatly increase the production of automobile parts without expanding production sites and equipment. The difficulties in striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule were overcome. Compared with 1950, the output of trucks increased by 13.5 percent, automobile parts increased threefold, and buses increased approximately fivefold. The growth in the output of the Stalin Automobile Factory over the past five years has mainly relied on the modification of high-yield equipment, the adoption of advanced operating procedures, and the mechanization and automation of laborious work. For example, in the forging workshop, fast-acting mechanical forging presses replaced many stamping steam hammers, increasing labor productivity by 20 to 25 percent. The factory as a whole increased labor productivity by 39 percent during the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
    The factory initiated many initiatives during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The most famous is the competition to save metal on every product, launched by the factory's young employees in early 1952. Hundreds and thousands of workers and technicians in the factory participated in this competition. As a result, each car manufactured by the factory consumed 73 kilograms less steel and 6 kilograms less non-ferrous metals. This movement, which later spread throughout the Soviet Union, demonstrated the spirit of thrift of the Soviet people. Employees in the forging workshop of the Stalin Automobile Factory carried out savings in many aspects. They analyzed and studied every occurrence of defective products, eliminated the phenomenon of no one being responsible for a large number of production parts, and marked each part, thereby reducing the number of defective products by three-quarters. They implemented an economic accounting system in every bay, section, and production team, saving 3 million rubles in four years.
    The method of high-speed metal cutting has been widely promoted in the factory. More than 1,700 lathes have applied this method. High-speed cutting worker Mokhov created a device that shortened the processing of a part that originally required four and a half hours to just forty minutes.
    In ensuring the early completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the factory's Party organization and Party members played a decisive role. Party member Yemelyanova is a core-making worker who completed the five-year plan in three years. Her selfless labor became a model for other core-making workers. Core-making workers adopted her work experience, increasing labor productivity by 40 to 50 percent. Due to the initiative of Party members, the forging workshop held a technical conference where people put forward 170 valuable suggestions.
    The factory employees are not complacent about completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The factory is preparing to manufacture new-style buses and sedans. A movement is underway in the factory to strive for technological progress. In order to comprehensively improve technology, the factory is conducting a social inspection to improve labor productivity. Nearly 10,000 people have participated in this inspection. In a short period of time, more than 5,500 rationalization proposals have been collected. (June 25th)

### 提前半年完成了五年计划

　　提前半年完成了五年计划
　　本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    六月二十四日是莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的大节日。这一天，在装配车间的传送带上出产的一辆汽车插着一面旗子，上面写着：“完成第五个五年计划的汽车”。
    苏联最大的汽车制造厂之一完成了第五个五年计划！这是斯大林汽车工厂全体职工爱国主义的忘我劳动的结果。他们和莫斯科其他十二个先进的工业企业的集体，在去年十月革命节前夕发起了提前完成第五个五年计划的社会主义竞赛。当时斯大林汽车工厂职工保证在今年七月完成五年总产量计划。现在这个保证先期实现了。他们提前六个月又六天在总产量上完成了五年计划。
    斯大林汽车工厂全体职工保持着长期不懈的劳动热情，因此工厂的产量一年年增高。如果以一九五○年的产量为一百，那末一九五一年为一○一点五，一九五二年为一一八点四，一九五三年为一三五点一，一九五四年为一五四点一，一九五五年头五个月中为一六四。这个总的成就是和工厂每个职工的勤恳努力分不开的。工厂有几千工人完成了个人所承担的五年计划任务，几百工人完成了两个五年计划定额。到过中国的镟工布舒也夫以及波普科夫，莫何夫在五年计划期间完成了十二、三年的定额。波普科夫说：“我的工作量很少低于四个定额，有时达到八个定额。我们许多人都是这样劳动着的。”在四年又五个月中，在生产中采用职工们提出的六万二千件合理化建议，为国家节约了一亿四千五百万卢布以上。
    去年春天和今年春天，工厂各个车间总共有六百多青年职工自愿到了阿尔泰和哈萨克斯坦支援开垦荒地。工厂曾经要在不扩增生产场所和设备的条件下，大批生产新产品——自行车和电气水箱，并大大增加汽车零件的生产。争取提前完成五年计划中的困难，被克服了。与一九五○年比较，载重汽车的产量增长了百分之十三点五，汽车零件增长为三倍，公共汽车增长约为五倍。斯大林汽车工厂五年来产量的增长，主要地是依靠改装高产率的设备、采用先进操作规程和费力劳动的机械化、自动化来达到的。例如，在锻造车间，用快动作的机械化的锻压机代替了许多冲压汽锤，把劳动生产率提高了百分之二十到二十五。全厂在五年计划期间提高了劳动生产率百分之三十九。
    工厂在五年计划期间发起了许多创举。最出名的是一九五二年初由工厂青年职工发起的在每一个产品上节约金属的竞赛。这个工厂成百成千的工人、技师都参加了这个竞赛。结果工厂制造的每一辆汽车少消耗七十三公斤钢铁和六公斤有色金属。这个后来传播到全苏联各地的运动，表现了苏联人民的节约精神。斯大林汽车工厂锻造车间的职工在许多方面进行了节约。他们每逢出现废品就加以分析和研究，消除了大量生产零件中的无人负责现象，在每个零件上作了标记，这样使废品减少了四分之三。他们在每一个跨间、工段、生产组实行经济核算制，在四年中节约了三百万卢布。
    在工厂里广泛地推行了金属高速切削方法。一千七百多台车床应用了这个方法。高速切削工人莫何夫创造了一种装置，把原来需要四个半小时的一种零件加工过程缩短到只要四十分钟。
    在保证提前完成五年计划中，工厂党的组织和党员起了决定性的作用。党员叶米扬诺娃是型心女工，在三年中完成五年计划。她的奋不顾身的劳动成为其他型心工人的模范。型心工人们采用她的工作经验，把劳动生产率提高了百分之四、五十。由于党员的发起，锻造车间举行了技术会议，会上人们提出了一百七十件有价值的建议。
    工厂职工没有以提前完成了五年计划而自满。工厂准备制造新式的公共汽车和轿车。工厂里展开着争取技术进步的运动。为着全面改进技术，工厂进行着提高劳动生产率的社会检查。已经有近一万人参加这次检查。在短短期间已经收集了五千五百多件合理化建议。（六月二十五日）
