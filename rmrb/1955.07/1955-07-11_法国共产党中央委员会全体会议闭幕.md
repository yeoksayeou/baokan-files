Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 10th: According to TASS, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party concluded on the 8th. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution on reports by Casanova and Servin.

The resolution noted that the struggle of the French working class to improve their living conditions has been strengthened, and emphasized that every party member and party organization must pay attention to listening to all the demands of the working masses.

The resolution emphasized the ever-expanding scale of the peace movement, suggesting that all Communist Party members and party organizations play the most active role in the campaign to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the People of the World," and resolutely demand that the French government take an independent stand at the Geneva Four-Power Summit that is in line with the interests of the French people and the cause of peace.

The resolution insisted that the French government should strictly abide by the Geneva Accords on Indochina, especially the agreement on holding general elections in Vietnam in 1956.

The resolution called for strengthening solidarity with the Algerian people, demanding the abolition of the state of emergency in Algeria, demanding an immediate end to colonialist oppression, the withdrawal of French armed forces and police, and the establishment of normal relations between the two countries in accordance with the interests of the French and Algerian people.

The resolution condemned French colonialism for using the Franco-Tunisian agreement to maintain its main positions, believing that the Tunisian people will be able to achieve new victories in the struggle for national independence.

The resolution finally emphasized the necessity of forming a united front with the Socialist Party. It said that despite the strong opposition of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party to united action, a united front is being established and is causing panic among the reactionaries.
