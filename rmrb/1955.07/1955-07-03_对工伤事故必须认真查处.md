　　To the Editor:

　　The Tianjin Xinxing Steel Factory (a joint state-private enterprise) has had 41 work-related accidents of varying severity in the months of April and May alone this year. These include serious incidents such as burns, crush injuries, sprains, and fractures. However, the factory leadership has not paid attention to these serious incidents that threaten worker safety.

　　Since the establishment of the joint state-private enterprise, the Xinxing Steel Factory has developed significantly. Many of the new workers transferred from the light industry system, and some are students and shop assistants. After these people enter the factory, the factory leaders do not educate them on safe operating procedures before sending them to work in the workshops. We know that steelmaking and steel casting are very intense and complex operations, and how can work-related accidents not occur without any instruction? This factory has long lacked operating procedures, and the production order is also very chaotic. For example, the tools used in each workshop are scattered everywhere, and they are only searched for all over the place when they are needed. The sandboxes and large tools in the sand molding workshop affect the operation of cranes because they do not have a fixed placement location. The handover between the previous and next shifts is not connected. The foreman in charge of production often leaves his post without authorization.

　　In addition, incomplete equipment and non-standard tools are also causes of work-related accidents. For example, the steel casting workshop uses tongs that were previously used to clamp small steel ingots weighing seventy or eighty pounds to clamp the currently produced steel ingots weighing more than two hundred pounds, resulting in compression and crushing accidents. Now that the weather is already very hot, the temperature in the charging workshop has reached over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Although the workers have proposed installing ventilation equipment, the ventilation equipment has not been installed.

　　Each time a work-related accident occurs, the administrative负责人 (responsible person) and the chairman of the trade union routinely fill out a reporting form for the cause of the accident and future prevention measures, but accidents still occur after the form is filled out. The "People's Daily" once published an editorial entitled "All Accidents Must Be Seriously Investigated and Dealt With." I ask the Local Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to earnestly examine the problems existing in the factory's production in accordance with the spirit of this editorial and effectively prevent work-related accidents.

### 对工伤事故必须认真查处

　　对工伤事故必须认真查处编辑同志：
    天津新兴钢厂（公私合营）在今年四、五两个月内，连续发生了大小工伤事故四十一次，其中有烫伤、砸伤、扭伤、压伤、折骨等等严重事件，而这个工厂领导人员对于这样严重威胁工人安全的事件却没有引起注意。
    新兴钢厂公私合营后有很大的发展，新添工人中很多是从轻工业系统转业来的，还有一部分是学生和店员。这些人进厂以后，工厂领导方面也不对他们进行安全操作的教育，就让他们到车间干活。我们知道炼钢、铸钢是一项十分紧张和操作复杂的工作，不加任何教导怎么能不发生工伤事故呢？这个工厂长期以来没有操作规程，生产秩序也十分混乱。例如各个车间所使用的工具到处乱放，等到要用的时候才遍地寻找；翻砂车间的砂箱和大型工具因为没有一定的安置地方，以致影响吊车的操作；上一班和下一班的交接工作互不联系；负责指挥生产的工长，经常擅自离开自己的工作岗位。
    另外，设备不完全和工具不合规格也是造成工伤事故的原因。像铸钢车间用过去夹七、八十斤小型钢锭的钳子，夹目前生产的二百多斤的钢锭，结果就造成了压伤和砸伤的事故。现在，天气已经很热，进料车间的温度已达到华氏一百二十度以上，工人们虽然提出安装通风设备的意见，但通风设备却一直没有安装起来。
    每一次工伤事故发生后，行政负责人和工会主席照例要填写一张事故发生原因和今后防止办法的上报表格，但填写以后事故仍然发生。“人民日报”曾发表过“对任何事故都必须认真查究和处理”的社论，我要求中共天津市委地方工业部按照这篇社论的精神，认真检查这个工厂生产中存在的问题，有效地防止工伤事故。　　　习　宁
