Martha Mousaki, Chairman of the Greek Democratic Women's League, wrote: "Women all over the world welcome the convening of the World Mothers' Conference. I have three sons, so I hope our children will no longer suffer the dangers of war. I believe that this Mothers' Conference can help achieve this desire." Mothers in Hiroshima, Japan, wrote to the International Preparatory Committee, calling on mothers all over the world to protect children from the disaster of atomic weapons. Mrs. Nancy of New York said in a letter that although mothers all over the world cannot all attend this conference, their hearts and their good wishes are with the mothers attending the conference.

　　Women from various countries have prepared many gifts for the World Mothers' Conference to express their support for the conference.
