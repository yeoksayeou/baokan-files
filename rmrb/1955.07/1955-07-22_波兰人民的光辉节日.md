    The Glorious Festival of the Polish People
    Su Xin

    Today, eleven years ago, the Polish people's own government—the Polish Committee of National Liberation—declared the birth of new Poland. The eleven years since then have been a period of profound changes in Poland's politics, economy, society, and culture.

    Pre-war Poland was one of the most backward countries in Europe in terms of economy, culture, and other aspects. During World War II and the occupation by Hitler's Germany, the lives and property of the Polish people suffered significant losses. When Poland was first liberated from the enslavement of fascist invaders, some people believed that it might take the strength of a generation to heal Poland's war wounds.

    However, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people threw themselves into the work of rebuilding their motherland with the same fighting spirit as they had in the struggle for national liberation, building the new Poland with the famous "Warsaw speed." Democratic reforms in society and the economy, as well as the expulsion of the bourgeoisie and landlord representatives who served as agents of imperialism from the government, laid the foundation for the rapid development of people's Poland. Poland began its Three-Year Reconstruction Plan from 1947 to 1949. In these short few years, Poland's industrial output had exceeded 77 percent of pre-war levels, and agricultural output per capita had also exceeded 19 percent of pre-war levels.

    From 1950, Poland began its Six-Year Plan, aimed at building the foundations of socialism. This year is the final year of the plan, and the main features of the implementation of Poland's Six-Year Plan and its significant achievements in building socialism can already be seen. If the total industrial output value of 1949—the year before the Six-Year Plan—is taken as 100, it had reached 242 in 1954, meaning that it was already close to the final target of the Six-Year Plan. The increase in the value of production materials has exceeded the target of the Six-Year Plan.

    In the past five and a half years, Poland has built more than 11,000 industrial units. Heavy industry, which serves as the foundation of socialist industry, has grown significantly. Poland's coal and steel production is now three times that of pre-war levels, and electricity is four and a half times that of pre-war levels. The heart of heavy industry—the machine-building industry—has increased its output eightfold compared to pre-war levels, and its share in Poland's total socialist industrial output value has reached more than 22 percent. Poland can now produce more than 90 million tons of coal, 4 million tons of steel, nearly 10,000 tractors, and more than 30,000 automobiles in a year. Its machine-building industry can manufacture thousands of different types of machines and machinery. In terms of total industrial output, Poland has risen from 19th place in Europe before the war to 5th place today, surpassing Italy, and on a per capita basis, it is almost on par with France. A comparison with the post-war industrial development speed of major capitalist countries in Europe further demonstrates the speed of Poland's construction and development. The industrial output of Britain and France in 1953 increased by about one-third compared to pre-war levels, West Germany and Italy increased by a little more than half, while Poland's industrial output has now increased threefold compared to pre-war levels.

    Poland's agriculture suffered very serious damage during the war. The occupation and plunder by Hitler's Germany left about half of Poland's land barren, and the number of livestock decreased by 60 percent. After liberation, based on the abolition of the pre-war feudal land system, and due to the concern of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, Poland's agriculture has made considerable progress. Adapting to the direction of building socialism, more and more working farmers have embarked on the path of production cooperation. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Poland has increased from 243 five years ago to nearly 10,000 now, including 225,000 farmer households. By the end of 1954, the socialist component of Poland's agriculture accounted for more than 21 percent of the country's cultivated land. Due to the large supply of agricultural machinery from industry, the degree of mechanization of Polish agriculture has greatly increased. The number of machine tractor stations has now reached 416, with 19,000 tractors. If state farms are included, nearly 50,000 tractors are used in Polish agriculture. In order to meet the needs of industrial and overall national economic development, the Polish people are now working even harder to strive for a surge in agriculture.

    The fundamental purpose of socialist construction is to raise the living standards of the urban and rural working people. With the forward development of production, the material and cultural life of the Polish people has also greatly improved. Unemployment has been completely eliminated. The total number of workers has increased from more than 2.7 million in 1938 to 6 million at present. The real income of workers and staff has increased by about 40 percent compared to pre-war levels, and the income of farmers has increased by three-quarters. The increase in income, coupled with the development of light industry and the food industry, has greatly increased the consumption and consumption levels of the working people. New schools, libraries, theaters, and hospitals are appearing everywhere. Every person in Poland can now receive a newspaper or publication every day, and there are nearly 50 university students for every 10,000 people.

    While engaging in socialist construction, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish government, have also spared no effort in the struggle to safeguard peace. From the first day of the establishment of people's Poland, striving for world peace and promoting international cooperation has become the main goal of the Polish government's foreign policy. Over the years, the People's Republic of Poland has united with the Soviet Union and the entire peace and democracy camp, making important contributions to the cause of maintaining peace.

    At various sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Polish delegation has put forward many important proposals, such as proposals on the Korean issue, on the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the easing of international tensions. Together with Czechoslovakia, India, and other countries, Poland actively participated in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, playing an important role in maintaining the Korean Armistice Agreement. After the Geneva Conference in 1954 reached an agreement on the cessation of the war in Indochina, Poland again participated in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Indochina.

    The People's Republic of Poland strives to coexist peacefully with countries with different social systems, and strives to develop normal international trade relations and cultural exchanges. On the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty, Poland has developed normal diplomatic relations with many capitalist countries in Europe and Asia, and is conducting friendly exchanges. Not long ago, Indian Prime Minister Nehru visited Poland. In a joint statement issued after talks with Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, the two prime ministers emphasized that "both governments have a desire for peace and a will to maintain peace," and confirmed the implementation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence in the mutual relations between the two countries.

    Based on painful historical experience, the Polish people resolutely oppose the revival of German militarism and make unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the German issue. Today, this effort is closely linked to the struggle for European collective security. The Polish government actively supports the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system, believing that this is a practical and reliable step to ensure peace and security in Europe. After the Western imperialist countries, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, passed the Paris Agreements aimed at rearming West Germany, the People's Republic of Poland, together with peace-loving countries in Europe, concluded a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. This treaty not only consolidated the security of peace-loving countries but also provided favorable conditions for the struggle for European collective security.

    As a result of economic development since liberation and the pursuit of an independent foreign policy, Poland has today become an independent, strong, and advanced country. As Beirut said: "The era before September 1939, when foreign powers treated Poland as a pawn in their gambling, is gone forever." Today, Poland, united with other countries in the peace and democracy camp, has become an important and stable factor in ensuring peace in Europe and the world.

    In celebrating their glorious festival, the Polish people proudly look back on their great achievements of the past eleven years.

    波兰人民的光辉节日
    苏新
    十一年前的今天，波兰人民自己的政权——波兰民族解放委员会宣告了新波兰的诞生。从那时以来的十一年，是波兰的政治、经济、社会和文化发生深刻变化的时期。
    战前的波兰，无论从经济或文化和其它方面来说，要算为欧洲最落后的国家之一。在第二次世界大战和希特勒德国占领期间，波兰人民的生命和财产更受到了重大的损失。当波兰刚从法西斯侵略者奴役下获得解放的时候，某些人士曾经认为，要使波兰的战争创伤得到医治，一代人的力量也未必能够胜任。
    但是波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导之下，以争取民族解放的同样的战斗姿态投入复兴祖国的工作，以著名的“华沙速度”建设起人民的新波兰。社会和经济的民主改革以及从政权中驱逐了作为帝国主义代理人的资产阶级、地主的代表，为人民波兰的迅速发展奠定了基础。波兰开始了从一九四七年到一九四九年的三年复兴计划。就在这短短的几年内，波兰的工业产量已超过了战前的百分之七十七，农业产量按人口计算也超过了战前的百分之十九。
    从一九五○年起，波兰开始了以建设社会主义基础为目的的六年计划。今年是这个计划的最后一年，已经可以看出波兰六年计划执行情况的主要面貌和它在建设社会主义方面的重大成就。如果以一九四九年——六年计划实行前一年的工业总产值为一百，那末在一九五四年已达到二百四十二，就是说，已经接近于六年计划的最后指标了。而生产资料产值的增加，则已超过了六年计划的指标。
    在过去五年半内，波兰建成了一万一千多个工业单位。作为社会主义工业基础的重工业有了很大的增长。现在波兰的煤和钢的产量等于战前的三倍，电力为战前的四倍半。重工业的心脏——机械工业的产量更增加为战前的八倍，它在波兰社会主义工业总产值中的比重已达到百分之二十二以上。现在波兰在一年内能生产九千多万吨煤，四百万吨钢，近一万台拖拉机和三万多辆汽车。它的机械工业能够制造几千种不同类型的机器和机械。按工业总产量来说，现在波兰已从战前的欧洲第十九位跃居到今天的第五位，超过了意大利，如按人口平均计算，差不多可以和法国并驾齐驱了。和欧洲主要资本主义国家战后工业发展的速度作一对照，就更能看出波兰建设发展的速度。英、法两国的工业产量在一九五三年比战前增加了三分之一左右，西德、意大利增加了一半多些，而波兰的工业产量现在比战前增加了三倍。
    波兰的农业在战争期间曾遭到十分严重的破坏。希特勒德国的占领和掠夺使波兰全国土地约有一半荒芜，牲畜头数减少了百分之六十。解放以后，在废除了战前的封建土地制度的基础上，由于波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的关怀，波兰农业有了相当的发展。适应建设社会主义的方向，越来越多的劳动农民走上了生产合作的道路。现在波兰的农业生产合作社已从五年前的二百四十三个增加到现在的近一万个，包括二十二万五千户农民。到一九五四年底为止，波兰农业的社会主义成分已占全国耕地的百分之二十一以上。由于工业供应了大量的农业机器，波兰农业的机械化程度大大提高了。现在机器拖拉机站的数目已达到四百一十六个，拥有拖拉机一万九千架，如果加上国营农场的，波兰农业中所使用的拖拉机已近五万架了。为了适应工业和整个国民经济发展的需要，波兰人民现在正在以更大的努力来争取农业的高涨。
    社会主义建设的根本目的是为了提高城乡劳动人民的生活水平。随着生产的向前发展，波兰人民的物质和文化生活也大大提高了。失业现象已完全消灭。工人的总数已从一九三八年的二百七十多万增加到目前的六百万。工人职员的实际收入比战前增加了约百分之四十，农民的收入增加了四分之三。收入的增加加上轻工业和食品工业的发展，使劳动人民的消费量和消费水平大大地提高了。新的学校、图书馆、剧院、医院到处出现。现在波兰全国每人每天可以分到一份报纸或刊物，差不多每一万人里就有近五十个大学生。
    在从事社会主义建设的同时，波兰人民在波兰政府的领导下也不遗余力地进行了维护和平的斗争。从人民波兰成立的第一天起，争取世界和平和增进国际合作就成为波兰政府外交政策的主要目标。这些年来，波兰人民共和国同苏联和整个和平民主阵营团结一起，对维护和平的事业作出了重要的贡献。
    在历届联合国大会上，波兰代表团曾经提出过许多重要建议，例如关于朝鲜问题，关于禁止使用原子武器、裁减军备和缓和国际紧张局势的建议。波兰同捷克斯洛伐克、印度等国家在一起，积极地参加了在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会，对维护朝鲜停战协定，起了重要作用。在一九五四年日内瓦会议达成关于停止印度支那战争的协定以后，波兰又参加了在印度支那的中立国监察委员会。
    波兰人民共和国努力争取和不同社会制度的国家和平共处，争取发展正常的国际贸易关系和文化交流。在平等互利、互相尊重主权的基础上，波兰同欧洲和亚洲的许多资本主义国家发展了正常的外交关系，并进行着友好的交往。不久以前印度总理尼赫鲁曾访问了波兰，在同波兰人民共和国总理西伦凯维兹会谈以后发表的联合声明中，两国总理强调了“两国政府都怀着和平的愿望和维护和平的意志”，并确认在两国的相互关系中实行和平共处的五项原则。
    根据惨痛的历史经验，波兰人民坚决反对德国军国主义的复活，并为和平解决德国问题而不懈努力。在今天，这种努力是同争取欧洲集体安全的斗争紧密地联系在一起的。波兰政府积极支持苏联所提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，认为这是保障欧洲的和平与安全的切实可靠的步骤。在西方帝国主义国家不顾世界人民的反对而通过了以重新武装西德为目的的巴黎协定以后，波兰人民共和国同欧洲爱好和平的国家一起缔结了友好合作互助条约。这个条约不但巩固了爱好和平国家的安全，而且也为争取欧洲集体安全的斗争提供了有利的条件。
    由于解放以来的经济发展和奉行独立自主的外交政策的结果，波兰今天已经成为一个独立、强盛的先进的国家了。正像贝鲁特所说的：“外国列强将波兰当作是他们赌博中走卒的那个一九三九年九月以前的时代是一去不复返了。”今天，波兰同和平民主阵营其他各国团结在一起，已成为保障欧洲与世界和平的一个重要的稳定的因素了。
    在庆祝他们光辉的节日的时候，波兰人民骄傲地回顾他们十一年来的巨大成就。
