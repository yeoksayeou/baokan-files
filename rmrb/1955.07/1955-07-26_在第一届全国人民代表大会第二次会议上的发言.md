**Speech by Liu Xianzhou**

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would like to say a few words about the First Five-Year Plan.

After carefully studying the draft of the First Five-Year Plan, I feel that every chapter and section of the plan and its indicators are based on thorough investigations or past practical experiences. Therefore, all the figures are highly reliable and proactive. The principles and issues that need attention proposed in the plan are also of great guiding significance for our future work in all aspects.

I would like to raise three issues from the perspective of an educator and scientist to support my views:

First, the quality of cadres should be emphasized in the future.

We aim to gradually build our motherland into a highly industrialized socialist country, which undoubtedly requires the continued training of a large number of construction cadres. However, if the quality of some of the trained cadres is poor, especially in terms of political quality, they will not meet the country's requirements.

In the past few years, the enrollment of new students in national colleges and universities has been overly focused on quantity and neglected quality. Some students have dropped out due to poor scientific foundations or poor health conditions. Some have extremely backward thoughts, even reactionary, and despite assistance and education from all sides, they remain ineffective. This part of the students with poor quality cannot be trained into socialist builders; they only occupy the quota and waste national resources.

We often think: if a higher industrial school is compared to a factory producing engineers, then the teaching equipment is the production tool; the teachers are the technical workers; the enrolled students are the raw materials; the graduates are the products. To improve the quality of the products, not only the quality of the production tools and the skills of the workers must be good, but the raw materials entering the factory must also meet certain specifications. Otherwise, producing substandard or defective products is inevitable.

In Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, it is proposed that "in higher schools, the training of construction cadres should focus on improving quality while also considering quantity." He also proposed: "In the future, we must pay attention to the quality of students and, under the condition of ensuring quality, appropriately increase the number, so that the trained technical cadres are politically reliable, professionally competent in modern scientific and technological knowledge, and physically healthy." This is the new requirement that the country has put forward for the quality and quantity of our higher schools' products, which I think is very correct and practical.

In Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, it is also proposed: "The minimum conditions for new students enrolled in higher schools should be politically reliable, physically able to endure learning, and academically able to keep up with the class." This is the guarantee that the country has put forward for the specifications of the raw materials entering our higher schools. It is also very important. From our perspective as those engaged in higher education, not only does it make our tasks easier to complete, but it will also reduce many of our difficulties. We fully support this. We hope that the Ministry of Higher Education will seriously and conscientiously implement this principle when organizing unified enrollment. At the same time, we should also follow Chairman Mao's call for "three goods," pay attention to comprehensive education, and reduce the number of substandard and defective products in the future, thus saving a lot of national resources.

Second, the problem of strengthening political and ideological work leadership in schools.

The draft plan proposes that in the task of developing higher education, attention should be paid to the sixth item: "...strengthen the leadership of political and ideological work, and strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and state policies by teachers, staff, and students." This is also a very correct and important measure, and there is no need for further explanation. However, we know that there are still some people in society, even some engaged in education, who do not pay enough attention to political and ideological work in schools. A few days ago, I heard that someone even expressed doubts about this item, so I would like to repeat it.

When we plan to carry out any work, we must first clarify the goal of that work. Because all work plans are formulated based on the work goals. For example, the work goal of a higher industrial school is clearly stated in the draft plan and report as: "to train a large number of engineers and technicians who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the socialist cause and who possess modern scientific knowledge." Since our training goal is so clear, then the sixth measure is very necessary. Graduates of higher industrial schools will be engineers or production commanders of socialist industrial units in the future, and they need to have socialist moral qualities first. Again, from my personal experience in school administration, whether it is the teaching work of teachers or the administrative work of staff, if the political and ideological work is well-led, making most of them have socialist awareness and a sense of ownership, then everything will be easier to improve. Otherwise, it will be labor-intensive and ineffective. Therefore, I believe that the proposal in the draft plan to strengthen political and ideological work leadership in school work and to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and state policies by teachers, staff, and students is the most important item. It should not be doubted at all, but rather, it should be given full attention.

Third, the issue of scientific research.

In Chapter VIII of the draft plan, there is a section on "Scientific Research Work." In terms of organization, it is proposed that the Chinese Academy of Sciences, various business departments, and various higher schools should have appropriate coordination; in terms of research objects, it also proposes a general division of labor principle. Finally, it is proposed: "All scientific research institutions should strengthen research on practical problems related to national construction," which is also very correct and necessary.

Any enterprise, such as any industrial enterprise, needs scientific research work to lead it to progress step by step. Otherwise, there is a possibility of falling behind in technology after a few years, or even a year and a half. In our industrial construction, the 156 large units helped by the Soviet Union are not only equipped with the most advanced equipment from the Soviet Union but also have Soviet experts helping us establish them from start to finish until they start production. We not only need to learn how to continue working but also must learn how to continue to progress. Because friends can only help us establish and start work, they cannot permanently replace us in working. To achieve the result of being able to continue to progress, we must attach corresponding scientific research institutions to lead it. The plan stipulates: "In addition to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, various business departments should also establish certain scientific research institutions," which is very correct.

With the development of national economic construction, the scientific research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, various business departments, and various higher schools will inevitably be gradually developed, which is also appropriate. However, if left unchecked, without strengthening its organization and planning, it is easy to cause, or even say, a phenomenon where some research work is unnecessarily repeated by various units, causing a certain waste of manpower and resources; on the other hand, there are some very important research work needed by the country that is difficult to start due to its difficulty. Both aspects bring certain losses to the country.

In the draft plan, the last sentence of "Regarding Scientific Research Work" says: "The scientific research plans of the research units under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research units under various business departments, and the scientific research plans of various higher schools should be gradually consolidated and balanced by the State Planning Commission," which is aimed at this point, so it is also extremely important.

We know that all work to build a socialist society should be carried out in an organized and planned manner. I hope that the State Planning Commission, in accordance with the established principles, will work with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and other relevant units to form a comprehensive leadership body, take the initiative to strengthen this aspect, so that scientific research work in all aspects of the country has unified and high organizational and planning, thereby gradually improving China's scientific and technological level, and avoiding unnecessary repetition and undesirable disconnection, which would be even better.

In summary, I wholeheartedly support this draft of the First Five-Year Plan, believing that it is completely in line with reality and has a very high guiding role. It will definitely push our motherland forward to a prosperous and happy socialist society. I propose that our conference unanimously adopt it and hope that all representatives and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, will make every effort to ensure its successful completion!

**Speech by Jia Tuofu**

I fully support the development of the national economy's first five-year plan draft. I also fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on this draft, as well as Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state budget and final accounts, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the Military Service Law, Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the Yellow River treatment and development plan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee.

The plan indicators and measures for light industry in the five-year plan draft are appropriate and correct. This has been proven by the smooth and over-fulfillment of the two-year plan in the past. Including this year, the plan indicators for the next three years, I believe, can also be completed and over-fulfilled with effort.

The vast majority of products produced by light industry are to meet the various needs of the people. The total output value of light industry products in the country has increased by two times in the past three years of recovery and two years of construction. The output of some products, such as cloth, paper, flour, sugar, cigarettes, and matches, has increased by about three times, two times, and one and a half times, respectively. The proportion of socialist industry in the national light industry has also increased from one-fourth to about one-half. This has enabled us to basically guarantee the market supply and social needs for many years, thereby also guaranteeing a certain degree of improvement in people's living standards and becoming an important source of national accumulation for construction funds.

However, the growth rate of people's needs for light industry products, especially in clothing and food, has quickly exceeded the growth rate of light industry production. For example, cotton cloth, jute bags, vegetable oil, sugar, cigarettes, leather, etc., all show different degrees of supply shortages. Although some daily necessities and medicines have accumulated due to poor quality, unsuitable specifications for social needs, and blind development, this is a temporary and partial phenomenon. From an overall perspective, the aforementioned situation of light industry products being in short supply remains the basic trend in light industry production at present and in the future. It is not difficult to understand that this trend reflects the superiority of our country's social system, reflects the continuous development of our country's agriculture and industry, and the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power. It will continuously promote the upsurge of our national economy.

The five-year plan draft stipulates that the production of consumer goods will increase by an average of 12.4% per year, which is an appropriate speed. Some people ask, since the growth rate of people's needs is very fast and the market supply is insufficient, since light industry has less investment, quick returns, and can accumulate a lot of funds, why not raise the plan indicators for light industry production a bit more? Everyone knows that our country, in order to fully develop the national economy and ensure national defense, must prioritize the development of heavy industry. Light industry should also only develop accordingly. The speed of development of light industry is not only determined by social needs but also depends on whether production capacity is possible and whether raw material supply is guaranteed. The three cannot be lacking. At present, the production capacity of our country's light industry, although some equipment is outdated and technology is relatively backward, has great potential. Many have not been fully utilized yet. For example, the equipment utilization rate in 1954 was: the national cigarette and match utilization rate was less than one-third, oil and flour were about half, leather was about 60%, and textile industry, in terms of state-owned enterprises, reached 96%, but due to the poor cotton harvest last year, the 1955 utilization rate will drop to 76%. From this, it can be seen that at present, many light industry productions cannot grow faster and larger mainly due to the shortage of raw materials. This is a difficult problem encountered in the development of light industry production.

The raw materials for light industry production are mostly obtained from agriculture, so the speed of development of agriculture, to a large extent, determines the speed of development of light industry, especially textile and food industry production. If we say that the production of consumer goods in 1953 could have a relatively large development (an increase of 28% compared to 1952), the main reason was the good harvest of agriculture in 1952. Then, the severe floods in 1954 would inevitably affect the supply of raw materials for textile and food industries in 1955, thus making the production of cotton yarn in 1955 less by more than 600,000 pieces compared to 1954, jute bags less by more than 18 million pieces, cigarettes less by 180,000 boxes, and oil pressing also less by 180,000 tons compared to the original plan. This would inevitably lead to many factories temporarily operating below capacity, and both national and workers' incomes would be reduced, and market supply would also feel some tension.

From this, it can be seen that to make the development of light industry production gradually catch up with the needs of people's lives and national construction, it is necessary to first solve the problem of raw material shortages. Everyone knows that although agricultural production has developed year by year and economic crops have increased year by year, it is impossible to achieve large-scale development in a short period of time. This is inseparable from the development of the country's heavy industry and the socialist transformation of agriculture. If there is no development of heavy industry, it is impossible to provide a large amount of chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, tractors, gasoline, diesel, water conservancy equipment, etc. to agriculture, it is impossible to fundamentally change the face of agriculture, and thus it is also impossible to solve the problem of raw material shortages in the development of light industry; at the same time, it is also impossible to provide chemical products, metal products, etc. raw materials and production equipment for light industry. Therefore, without the development of heavy industry, there can be no development of light industry. Before the development of heavy industry, it is not realistic to promise a large increase in the production of cloth, food, etc. It is not feasible.

But this does not mean that now we want to increase the production of light industry, we can only wait for the large-scale development of heavy industry and agriculture, and there is no other way. No. If we can tap potential, increase production and savings, actively expand raw material resources, find various substitutes, implement various waste recycling, overcome various waste and unreasonable phenomena in the use of raw materials, under the condition of ensuring quality, save materials, improve the output rate, reduce the rate of defective and substandard products, improve product quality, reduce some accumulated products and produce new types of products needed by society, then the difficulty of raw materials can still be reduced, and production can naturally be increased accordingly.

It should be pointed out that all light industry production enterprises have great potential for increased production and savings. Various light industry departments and their affiliated enterprises have also made some efforts in increased production and savings. In 1954, the light industry sector completed or over-fulfilled the state plan for more than 40 kinds of major products, which is inseparable from the promotion of various effective measures for increased production and savings. For example, the textile industry in 1954 averaged 388.7 jin of cotton per piece of yarn, saving 1.84 jin of cotton per piece of yarn compared to 1953. The Ministry of Light Industry in 1955, on the basis of the state plan to reduce costs by 6.5%, further determined to reduce by another 1.64%, which proves that there is great potential for savings in light industry production enterprises. However, it cannot be denied that, as some representatives have criticized, there are still quite serious waste phenomena in our use of raw materials, and there are still many resources that have not been fully and reasonably utilized.

In the textile industry, the phenomenon of wasting cotton and yarn is quite common. Some state-owned cotton textile mills have three jin of cotton waste per piece of yarn in the fine spinning workshop. Comparing the national cotton consumption per piece of yarn, in 1954, the Tianjin Cotton Mill used 390 jin plus a little, while many other regions used more than 394 jin. One factory in May last year used more than 2,600 jin of yarn for weaving cloth in one month, exceeding the quota. In the oil pressing industry, the difference in oil output rate between advanced enterprises and backward enterprises in the country is the largest: peanut 12%, sesame 11%, rapeseed 16%, cottonseed 11.2%, soybean 6.5%. In the paper industry, the same ton of newsprint uses 180 jin of pulp more or less, and the same ton of bleached reed pulp uses 400 jin of reed more or less. In the food industry, the same box of cigarettes uses 10 jin of tobacco more or less, and the same 100 jin of liquor uses more than 50 jin of grain. In the rubber industry, the same type of car tire uses 4 jin of raw rubber more or less. These waste phenomena are not individual but exist in large quantities and universally in the country. If we take effective measures to promote thrift and overcome waste, make advanced enterprises continue to improve on the basis of consolidating their achievements, and at the same time, raise the technical and management level of backward enterprises to or close to the level of advanced enterprises, then this will save a lot of raw materials for the country, thereby increasing a lot of production.

In the past half year, various departments of light industry have initially proposed some increased production and savings indicators through various professional conferences: in the textile industry, in 1955, it is required that the national average cotton consumption per piece of yarn be reduced by 3 to 5 jin on the basis of ensuring quality, which can be done and must be done. The Shandong Shihuixin cotton rolling and matching method, if promoted nationwide, can at least increase the production of cotton lint by 1%. After the cotton mills and cottonseed oil mills add the cotton lint removal equipment, each dan of cottonseed can at least increase the production of cotton lint by 4.5 jin. To solve the shortage of cotton, wool, hemp, and silk in the long term, it is necessary to actively develop synthetic fibers. A synthetic fiber factory has already started to be built. The jute bag industry uses hemp, wild hemp, cotton stalk skin, and other fibers mixed with yellow and foreign hemp to weave, which is also a way to save raw materials and increase production. In the paper industry, at the Second Session of the National People's Congress last year, a representative proposed researching the use of other pulps to make paper to save wood. The Ministry of Light Industry, based on this proposal, has conducted trials using straw, sugarcane residue, and other pulps, and has decided to build a factory in Guangdong to use sugarcane residue to make pulp and paper. In the cigarette industry, this year's national average tobacco consumption per box has been reduced from the original plan of 122 jin to not more than 120 jin, which is completely feasible. To solve the shortage of cigarette raw materials, it is also possible to promote the cultivation of two crops of tobacco and the peeling of tobacco stems. In the sugar industry, mechanical sugar reduces losses and increases the sugar output rate. For example, the Northeast sugar beet sugar factory plans to increase production by more than 1,400 tons of sugar this year without increasing raw materials; the output of traditional sugar is large, but the sugar output rate is low, and management should be strengthened, technology should be improved, and production should be increased. In the rubber industry, tires adopt new designs to improve quality and save rubber, and rubber shoes adopt the sewing and molding methods of some advanced factories in Shanghai, and strive to save 1,500 tons of raw rubber this year. The oil and fat industry actively promotes the Li Chuanjiang oil pressing method to improve the oil output rate and actively uses silkworm pupae, orange peels, sunflower seeds, castor seeds, and other kernels to press oil, striving to complete the task of increasing the production of 100,000 tons of food oil. The leather industry, in addition to considering some minority nationalities, generally uses pigskin and other miscellaneous skins to make leather, and is preparing to manufacture artificial leather to replace and save cowhide. To save grain, it is also necessary to actively find substitutes for brewing and feed. In addition, strengthen the recycling and use of waste rubber, waste cotton, old cloth, waste paper, and other waste materials that can be used, and reduce the loss of raw materials in transportation and storage. All of these have great economic significance. We must mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the role of scientific institutions and experimental research institutions, strengthen experimental research work, and rationally use and expand raw material resources.

Due to the poor quality of some products in the light industry, there are many defective and substandard products, which also cause a lot of waste. As some representatives have criticized, in 1954, the quality problem of pharmaceuticals and medical instruments in the light industry was the most prominent, with the factory internal defective rate of injections generally between 20% and 30%, and 45 out of 70 commonly used tablets often had insufficient content and were not easily soluble. The pharmaceutical factories and medical instrument factories under the Ministry of Light Industry also often have defective and reworked products in the factory, and even some products have been returned after leaving the factory. Although this situation has improved in the past half year, it is still not enough and has not stabilized. In the textile industry, about one-third of the factories did not complete the cotton cloth first-grade rate plan last year. The quality plan for paper-making was not completed in some factories, and printing paper often had too many impurities and was not smooth enough. In the rubber industry, a period last year had some tires bursting before reaching 10,000 kilometers (the planned indicator was 25,000 kilometers); some rubber raincoats stuck together; some rubber shoes were not durable. In addition, such as food contamination, turbid beer, and cracked and softened soap, these problems have not been completely solved. This necessarily causes the waste of raw materials, funds, manpower, and equipment, increases the cost of products, and causes dissatisfaction among consumers. This also shows that technical work is a weak link in the management of our light industry enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to improve technical work by revising product standards, improving process procedures, and strengthening inspection systems, strengthening technical leadership, and improving the responsibility system to truly ensure and improve product quality.

Some comrades think that emphasizing the conservation of raw materials means not emphasizing the improvement of quality, or that emphasizing the improvement of quality means not emphasizing the conservation of raw materials. This is incorrect. Ensuring and improving quality is not to waste materials, on the contrary, poor quality, and many defective and substandard products are the greatest waste of raw materials. Conserving materials should be the result of improving technology and management, and it absolutely cannot be the result of cutting corners, shoddy work, and poor quality. Therefore, while conserving raw materials, it is necessary to ensure and improve quality; similarly, while ensuring and improving quality, it is also necessary to conserve raw materials.

The management fees of light industry production enterprises are high, the turnover of working capital is slow, and the occupation of working capital is excessive, which is a waste that cannot be ignored.

The main reason for the high management fees of enterprises is that the organizational structure of enterprises is too large, and there are too many non-production personnel, which increases the expenditure and encourages the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility. The main reason for the waste of working capital of enterprises is that the inventory is too large and the turnover is slow. For example, in 1954, the working capital occupied by the Ministry of Light Industry exceeded the plan by 27%, of which the excess reserve and stagnant, accumulated part of raw materials accounted for more than 70%. This also shows that cost and financial work is another weak link in the management of our light industry enterprises.

All the waste of raw materials, the poor quality of products, and the high management fees of enterprises will ultimately be reflected in the high cost of products. Some comrades, in their management of industry, only pay attention to completing the production plan and do not pay attention to the cost and financial plan; only pay attention to completing the quantity and output value plan and do not pay attention to the variety and quality plan; do not calculate carefully and do not pay attention to economic results; and even do not face these shortcomings, but instead foster a complacent and self-satisfied attitude. This is incorrect. In the future, it is necessary to emphasize political and ideological work, strengthen cost and financial management and technical leadership, strictly establish and improve the management system of raw materials and funds, improve labor organization, seriously implement quotas and staffing, implement economic accounting, and improve labor productivity. Only by continuously improving the technical and management level of enterprises can we continuously tap the huge potential in light industry production, implement various measures for increased production and savings, continuously improve production, quality, and reduce costs, increase accumulation for the state, and ensure the full and over-fulfillment of the state plan.

In terms of supplying the necessary goods for people's lives, private industry and handicrafts still play a significant role. The state should strengthen the socialist transformation of private industry and handicrafts and, based on the principle of comprehensive consideration, arrange their production item by item and industry by industry. Private industry and handicrafts should also actively improve management, improve technology, improve quality, conserve raw materials, reduce costs, and adapt to social needs and the requirements of national construction.

If we say that the main task in light industry production is to increase production and savings to increase accumulation for the state, then in terms of basic construction, it should be to overcome waste and save investment for the state. The five-year plan draft stipulates that the investment in light industry basic construction is approximately 11.2% of the total industrial investment, which is an appropriate proportion. The funds invested by the state in industrial construction must be concentrated and used to prioritize the development of heavy industry. This has been mentioned above. We should not have any doubts about this. We should also see that at present, various types of light industry and extensive handicrafts in various places across the country still have great potential to be utilized due to the shortage of raw materials. If we do not consider this situation, blindly emphasize the need while ignoring the possibility of raw material supply, emphasize the development of light industry while ignoring the development of heavy industry, only care about state-owned enterprises while ignoring private and handicraft industries, only see the local situation while ignoring the national situation, and blindly invest in light industry, build new or expand existing facilities in large quantities, then it is very likely that the factories will be built but cannot operate due to the lack of raw material supply, or new factories will operate while old factories will stop, state-owned enterprises will be built while private enterprises will stop, new factories will be built in one place while old factories will stop in another, modern industry will be built while handicraft industry will stop. This will bring great waste to the country. In the past few years of basic construction in light industry, although most of the projects were appropriate and reasonable, there were also some projects that could have been built or delayed, such as jute bag factories, gold pens, steel pens, pencil factories, injection, tablet factories, medical instrument factories, etc., which were too many or too early. This not only caused a waste of basic construction investment but also increased the difficulty of production arrangements at present.

Therefore, this spring, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the social demand, the supply of raw materials, and the production capacity of various types of light industry were recalculated, and some basic construction projects that should be reduced and can be delayed in the original plan of the textile industry and light industry were reduced and delayed; the saved funds, if invested in heavy industry construction, could build a tractor factory with an annual production of 15,000 vehicles and two oil refineries with an annual production of 100 million tons. This measure is completely necessary and correct.

But this does not mean that light industry should not build or expand anything. No. All necessary basic construction that is essential for society, has a reliable guarantee of raw materials, and cannot meet production requirements with existing enterprises should still be carried out and must be carried out. Such as some paper mills, sugar mills, synthetic fiber mills, antibiotic factories, etc., have already been included in the five-year plan for construction. Some construction projects with no difficulty in raw materials and necessary construction can also be considered for addition in the annual plan.

After correctly determining the basic construction plan for light industry, the main task is how to complete it well, quickly, and economically. It is necessary to implement thrift and oppose waste in all aspects of design, construction, and installation. It is not possible to use investment power evenly and dispersedly without distinguishing between main and secondary, urgent and important. The Ministry of Light Industry's investment use in the past two years had this problem. According to preliminary inspections, about one-fifth of the investment was not used reasonably or could have been saved. Therefore, all basic construction projects should be strictly reviewed. Those that can be built, delayed, not invested in, or invested in less should be built, delayed, not invested in, or invested in less to save national investment and fully utilize the investment effect. It is not possible to use the excuse of "a hundred-year plan, quality first" to spend money without regard to the amount. It is not possible to distinguish between productive construction and non-productive construction. For productive construction, it should be required to reach a certain level of modernization because it is beneficial and necessary for improving production. But for non-productive construction, it is wrong to require it to reach the level of modernization. This would cause the limited funds of the state to be accumulated in the non-productive part, thereby limiting the development of production and fostering a wind of extravagance and waste. Recently, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the local industrial sector, based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to promote thrift, reviewed and examined the basic construction plan and investment for the next three years in the draft of the first five-year plan item by item and target by target, and conducted a second reduction. The total amount of the two reductions is approximately 30% of the original five-year basic construction allocation. If the Xian Cotton Mill No. 5 with 100,000 spindles under construction is designed and standardized according to the layout and standards of the already completed No. 3 and No. 4 mills, the original plan was to invest about 70 million yuan, but now, based on the new spirit of comprehensive thrift, it is recalculated and appropriately modifies the standards and quotas, reduces the cost; according to the person in charge of the construction, only 50 million yuan or so is needed. From this, it can be seen that as long as the national standards and quotas are strictly followed, all one-sided, rash, novelty-loving, large-scale, wasteful, extravagant, and wasteful tendencies are corrected, a thorough inspection is conducted, and thrift is strictly implemented, we can save a large amount of funds for the country.

During the first five-year plan period, light industry mainly relies on the development of existing production potential, plus some new and expanded projects entering production, the planned production volume of several major products in 1957 will have a significant increase compared to 1952. Such as cloth (excluding hand-woven cloth) increased by 45.8%, flour (excluding individual handicrafts) increased by 56%, sugar (including individual handicrafts) increased by 144%, salt (including individual handicrafts) increased by 52.7%, edible vegetable oil (including individual handicrafts) increased by 82.6%, paper (including individual handicrafts) increased by 65.5%, rubber shoes increased by 75.6%, matches increased by 39.4%. It can be said that such a scale and speed of development cannot be considered small or slow, which is basically able to meet the needs of people's lives. Generally speaking, it is what we can get under the current national economic foundation and production level. Naturally, this amount of goods cannot fully meet social needs. Because in our country, the growth of social needs is always ahead of production. We must do everything possible to increase production to gradually meet the growing social needs. The construction we are currently engaged in is precisely for this purpose. Let us move forward with confidence along the broad and smooth path of socialism!

**Speech by Dao Jingban**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," as well as the other reports. I will work hard at my post to realize the First Five-Year Plan.

Since the establishment of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and higher state organs, we have further strengthened national unity and achieved remarkable results in training ethnic cadres, developing production, trade, education, health, and other construction work, thus giving the autonomous region a new look.

Since the promulgation of the Constitution of our country, the various ethnic groups and classes of people in Dehong Autonomous Region have been jubilant and enthusiastic, unanimously supporting it, and proposing to "gradually transition to a socialist society together with all the brotherly ethnic groups in the country." However, in our region, the feudal land system still exists, which restricts the development of the productive forces of the broad laboring peasantry, and the peasants have no land, which affects the peasants' enthusiasm for production and their lives. This unreasonable system is the main factor hindering the development and progress of the various ethnic groups in our region and the root cause of the long-term poverty of the people. This, we did not understand in the past. In recent years, through the education of the Party and the masses, and through visits and learning in various places, seeing the new situation after social reform, we gradually realized that only by reforming the old social system can we develop production and enable our autonomous region's ethnic groups to get rid of poverty and backwardness, and gradually transition to a socialist society together with all the brotherly ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, in 1954, under the voluntary renunciation of the masses and us, the abolition of official rent was announced. In April this year, the People's Government Committee of the Autonomous Region held a meeting, formulated the "Land Adjustment Regulations Draft for the Dai Region" based on the specific situation of the Dehong area, and carried out land adjustment pilot work through peaceful consultation. In the pilot work, due to the leadership of the Party, the correct implementation of policies by the cadres, relying on the masses, and with the support of the leaders of the local ethnic groups, the pilot work was basically completed smoothly by the end of June. Landless farmers each received more than 500 jin of land with a yield of over 500 jin. Now, the farmers who have just received the land are working hard and happily on their own land, and they excitedly say: "In the past, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the reactionary Kuomintang, and now we have reformed the land system. We can organize mutual aid and cooperation and move towards a socialist society." In this way, the people support the Communist Party and the people's government even more, and the relationship between the people and the autonomous organs is even closer. And I myself also feel very happy. Before the reform, due to the slander and incitement of imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang, we were anxious about social reform. But after the pilot, we saw that the Party's policy is correct, and our worries were eliminated, making us deeply realize that: only believe in the Communist Party, always follow the Communist Party, study hard, and do good things for the people, that is the only way forward.

In the pilot reform, due to our lack of vigilance, many cadres and masses have serious peaceful complacency, giving the imperialist and Kuomintang remnant special agents and counter-revolutionary elements the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. They try to sow discord, spread rumors, threaten the masses, sabotage production, and even commit arson and murder to sabotage our reform work. We will never tolerate such counter-revolutionary activities by the imperialists and their running dogs. In the future, we must especially pay attention to strengthening unity and vigilance in the reform throughout the region, prevent any sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements, and punish those who dare to sabotage the reform and violate the policies and laws of the people's government, so as to ensure the smooth progress of our reform work.

Reforming the land system is the central task in our region at present. At the same time, we should also actively work to implement the various self-government rights stipulated in the Constitution, especially the use of local ethnic scripts. In the past, due to the fact that Dai script and Jingpo script themselves were not perfect enough, we did not pay enough attention to this work, so the autonomous organs rarely used local ethnic scripts to exercise their powers, and there was no use of ethnic scripts in schools. Now, Dai script has been appropriately improved, and Jingpo script is also being improved. We have established a translation agency and are training cadres to gradually promote the use of local ethnic scripts, so as to better play the role of the autonomous organs, quickly popularize education and develop local ethnic culture, and also absorb advanced Han culture, improve the patriotic and socialist awareness of local ethnic people.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and higher state organs, with the support of all ethnic groups, especially the Han people, and the help of Han cadres, we are confident to do a good job in these tasks and strive to catch up with the advanced brotherly ethnic groups as soon as possible and gradually enter the socialist society!

**Speech by Hu Ziyang**

After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," and combining it with the study of the five-year plan draft, we realize that the socialist transformation of the capitalist industry and commerce is a necessary part of our country's socialist construction. The plan points out that one of the basic tasks of the first five-year plan is: "to basically put the capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, and to lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce." This shows that during the first five-year plan period, the transformation of the capitalist industry and commerce will be greatly advanced on the existing basis.

The transformation of the capitalist industry and commerce is a long-term, arduous, and complex task. To achieve this task, a series of work must be done. From our past experience in guiding this work, we have realized that increased production and savings is an effective way to transform the capitalist industry. Whether it is the industry that has already entered various forms of state capitalism or the private industry that is creating conditions, all have improved the quantity and quality of products to a certain extent, improved the public-private relations and labor-management relations, and changed the backward state of the enterprise. This is an important step for the private industry to accept socialist transformation.

In the past year and a half, 97 factories in Chongqing have carried out increased production and savings work. Many factories have achieved remarkable results in enterprise transformation through this movement and have also promoted the transformation and improvement of the capitalist's thoughts. For example, the private Daming Textile Factory was previously poorly managed, weak in leadership, and wasteful. It could not meet the state's requirements for production tasks for a long time. In September last year, under the leadership of the Party, the increased production and savings movement was launched, and the workers formulated a production plan. The capitalists also received education in the movement, improved their awareness, and relied on the workers to improve technology and management. In less than a year, the equipment remained the same, and the workers remained the same, but due to the launch of the increased production and savings movement, the product quality was significantly improved, and the cotton consumption was greatly reduced. For example, in August last year, each piece of yarn used 403 jin of cotton, which was reduced to 387 jin in March this year. This alone saved 80,000 yuan worth of raw cotton in a year, and the enterprise turned from loss to profit. Another export business, a sausage factory, had previously serious capitalist management ideas, large waste, high costs, and each sausage cost 1.5 yuan to process and still made a loss. After launching the increased production and savings movement, under the slogan of "making one more barrel of sausage, buying half a ton of steel," the processing cost of each sausage was reduced to 5.2 yuan, the quality met the export standard, and the enterprise still made a profit. In addition, the soap industry in Chongqing, during the increased production and savings movement, used cheap and sufficient soda ash to replace part of the wood oil, saving more than 10,000 dan of wood oil and increasing the production of soap by 60,000 to 70,000 boxes; the leather industry, due to technological improvements, reduced the defective rate from 50% to less than 10%, thus completing the state's task.

From the above examples, we have initially summarized several experiences: First, the increased production and savings movement in private industry must rely on the leadership of the Party. Only under the leadership of the Party can we achieve democracy, fully consult, and give full play to the role of various organizations. In addition, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association should also fully attach importance to this work, closely cooperate with the trade unions, and take consistent steps to help and educate the capitalists to overcome the passive waiting mentality and actively participate in the movement. Second, aiming at the shortcomings of private industry, such as low product quality, high costs, and large waste, start from formulating and implementing the production plan to gradually change the blind production of private industry and the backward state of management, and ensure the completion of state tasks. Third, vigorously organize technical research, reward and help inventions, constantly pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience, quickly improve the technical level, improve the quality, reduce the cost, and open up the market.

However, we recall that in the past, we have taken many detours in assisting the increased production and savings work of private industry. The biggest drawback is that we did not grasp it tightly, and sometimes it was formalistic. Up to now, some businessmen still have a passive waiting mentality; many capitalists and their agents still lack a proper understanding of the great significance of increased production and savings; in the movement, there are still activities of expanding expenditures, withdrawing funds, and speculating, and they have not accepted ideological transformation, and still adopt a shoddy and irresponsible attitude towards production and management, resulting in a lot of rework and defective products, and even the phenomenon of cutting corners and committing the "five poisons" still occurs from time to time. In April this year, we checked the execution of 70 processing and procurement contracts in five industries, including steel and machinery, electrical materials, and found that the rate of violations and illegal acts was over 30%. Again, we checked a machinery factory, in which the defective rate of 5,000 sets of leather rollers reached 39.8%. These situations fully show that we have not done enough in ideological education work in the past, and our work is still too simple and rough. We must correct this firmly in the future and remember the valuable experience that "the transformation of capitalist enterprises must be combined with the transformation of the capitalist's thoughts."

In addition, to help private industry carry out increased production and savings work better, we also need to consider some problems currently existing in private industry. According to our understanding: the state-owned enterprises currently have some processing and procurement tasks allocated in the quarter before, and some are allocated in the quarter after it begins, while the state-owned specialized companies regulate the supply of raw materials to be proposed 50 days before the quarter and to sign supply and marketing contracts, thus making private factories face the actual difficulty of production tasks and raw material supply not matching. In addition, some state-owned enterprises change the plan midway after allocating tasks, making it difficult for private factories to formulate production plans and causing losses. These problems are caused by the lack of planning and poor internal coordination in the past, and we believe that with the strict control of the state plan in the future, these problems can be resolved appropriately.

Finally, we feel that while the report and the plan criticize the wasteful behavior of state organs and state-owned enterprises, we should also see that the situation of errors in this regard is very serious in the private industry and commerce. We must strengthen management, prevent waste, and strive to accumulate funds, gradually bring all the use of funds into the state plan. We must, without exception, together with state-owned enterprises, fight against all wasteful behavior, ensure that our accumulation is not dispersed, not stolen, and not diverted to unnecessary purposes, to strengthen the forces of our country's socialist construction, and to accelerate the industrialization of our country.

Our first five-year plan is about to be passed, which is the most exciting thing for all the people of the country. Our enemies are hating us, cursing us, and using various methods to sabotage our five-year plan. In the struggle to condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we found that there are also people in the industrial and commercial circles who have been infiltrated by the poison of Hu Feng; again, in the inspection work, we found that many counter-revolutionary elements have colluded with corrupt merchants to carry out evil activities to sabotage the grain policy. We must resolutely strike these bad elements. The state, in the implementation of the five-year plan, is a serious test for every enterprise and every individual in the capitalist industry and commerce. We hope that friends in the industrial and commercial circles, together with all the people of the country, will always be vigilant, distinguish between enemies and friends, and make up their minds to accept the socialist transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, launch a comprehensive increased production and savings movement, and strive for the implementation of the state's first five-year plan!

**Speech by Chen Jiageng**

At this meeting, I have listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them.

The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy is an unprecedented event in China's history. This great plan will inspire overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country to unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and strive to realize this great plan.

Chairman Mao said: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." The first five-year plan is to lay the foundation for the industrialization of our country's socialist society. Under the full assistance of the Soviet Union, many remarkable achievements have been made in the past two years of implementation, such as the development of various heavy industries, the corresponding development of light industry, railways, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, which have all increased several times compared to before liberation, with a speed that capitalist countries can only look up to. Due to the development of various construction projects, people's material and cultural lives have been continuously improved, international status has reached an unprecedented height, and national defense has been greatly enhanced, thus shattering the dream of the Kuomintang's traitorous clique to restore power and also shattering the aggressive ambitions of imperialism. However, the enemy is not reconciled to failure, and they are using every means to try to sabotage our socialist construction. The enemy's conspiracy activities are extremely vicious and malicious. Our government's suppression of hidden Kuomintang special agents and counter-revolutionary elements in the past has not been thorough enough, and even lenient. From the treason of Gao-Rao and the recent conspiracy activities of Pan Hannan and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements, we must seriously pay attention and be vigilant. We believe that as long as the people of the whole country are vigilant and wholeheartedly assist the government in eliminating the remnants of bandits and counter-revolutionaries, it will not be difficult to eliminate them.

"The Comprehensive Plan for the Treatment of Yellow River Disasters and the Development of Yellow River Water Conservancy" is a major event in China's history. After the completion of the first phase of the project, the natural landscape of the Yellow River basin will undergo a great change, and the river that has harmed the people for thousands of years will become a river that benefits the country and the people. This is something that can only be achieved in the era of Mao Zedong. This great plan not only inspires the people of the whole country but also inspires the 12 million overseas Chinese who love their motherland, further strengthening the support and pride of overseas Chinese for the people's government of their motherland.

At this meeting, everyone is also very concerned about agricultural production. Although some provinces have suffered from severe floods in the past two years, and some places in Fujian and Guangdong have experienced the worst drought in decades, agricultural production has still increased year by year from the national statistics. The state construction plan is not affected by disasters in some regions. In terms of basic construction, considerable achievements have also been made in the past two years, but it cannot be denied that there has been a lot of waste and loss in the construction of buildings in these two years. This situation has been reported in newspapers many times, and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian have also emphasized this in their reports. I think that national construction and the construction industry are closely related. This first five-year plan includes heavy and light industry, culture, health, cities, and villages, all of which are related to construction. Clothing, food, and housing are essentials for human beings. With China's vast territory, numerous people, the initial stage of industrialization, and the improvement of people's welfare, the old is replaced by the new, and modernization is gradually achieved. The construction of the capital and various large cities will be a model for the whole country. Those in a model position should be particularly cautious about extravagance and waste. I will briefly mention what I have seen and heard below:

I heard that the cost of ordinary construction is about 120 yuan per square meter, and recently I heard that many places have reached more than 200 yuan, and some have reached 300 yuan, more than doubling. If in the early years of liberation, new building projects had no experience and lacked standard budgets, it could be understood; now it has been many years, and there is considerable experience. For every building to be built, a design must be drawn: what materials to use, how many square meters, how many million yuan of construction costs, all have been determined and handed over to the responsible agency to handle; even if there are discrepancies, they should be extremely limited. Why wait until the project is completed to know?

I came to Beijing last winter and visited the Beijing Overseas Chinese Middle School. It is said that the construction cost of the school is about 120 yuan per square meter. If it is the Min Nan University in Xiamen and the Jimei School, these four years have built dozens of school buildings, with an area of more than 100,000 square meters, with an average of 34.5 yuan per square meter, the wages and prices are almost the same as in Beijing, and it is said that the buildings are solid and beautiful, which are not inferior to the gymnasium (with an average of 5 square meters per student), sewer, well, road, electricity, etc., each square meter is only 40 yuan, but without heating and water pipes. The design and management fees account for about 5 yuan out of 100 yuan. It is heard that a construction company in Xiamen needs 20 to 20-plus yuan out of 100 yuan, and this place also needs 20 yuan or so. If this is true, it is a waste in construction.

The problem of building wooden scaffolding, in Min Nan, if the wall is built with bricks, even if it is a four or five-story building, it is free from scaffolding, and workers stand on the wall to stack bricks, and the bricks are moved to the upper floor, and small workers use their hands to pass the bricks to the operating workers on the wall. If the wall is made of stone, each stone weighs 200 to 300 jin, then scaffolding is needed, but it is very simple, only a ladder is built, which can accommodate four people to carry up. In Singapore, most of the buildings are three to four stories high, and seven to eight stories to more than ten stories are rare. The construction workers are mostly from Min Nan, and the walls are mostly built with bricks, and the operation is done by two people cooperating, one inside the wall and one outside the wall. Although scaffolding is built, it is a safety standard scaffold designed by the architect, but it is also very simple. It is built when the construction is about to begin, and it is not like this place where the scaffolding is built in layers, dense as fish scales, before the construction begins, and even before the construction begins, the entire set of scaffolding is already built. Not only is it unnecessary waste, but it also needs to prevent the danger of rotting over time. I don't know if this scaffolding method is a habit of the workers or a safety regulation of the architect.

The construction of school auditoriums or public halls should avoid echoes, and the heavier ones are even difficult to hear. The architect should use various soundproofing materials, which may be effective. I have seen many halls, some with echoes and some without. But there is no difference in the windows and the height of the interior, and the cause of the echo is unknown. Last year, the gymnasium of Jimei School with 4,000 seats and the gymnasium of Xiamen University with 5,000 seats were completed this year, both without echoes, and the entire house has no special equipment, only the seats are made into a slope, for the audience in the back row to avoid being blocked by the front row while watching, each row of the ground is lowered by 3 inches, and there are more than 50 rows, with a height difference of more than 100 inches, compared to the Huairen Hall, which is more sloped. The Huairen Hall also has no echoes. I wonder if the lack of echoes is related to the slope. Our country's construction has just begun, so I dare to introduce it for reference.

The importance of our country's first five-year plan lies in the development of industry. When the people's government was established, Chairman Mao instructed: "To transform an agricultural country into an industrial country." To promote local prosperity and improve people's lives, industrial development is necessary. The development of industry will definitely promote our country's foreign trade. Southeast Asia has a lot of tropical climate, plants, and minerals that are different from our country. Such as coal, iron, cement, glass, paper, cloth, silk, medicine, fruits, and various industrial daily necessities, some of which are not available in other places but are available in our country, all of which can be exported to exchange for the special products of Southeast Asia, such as rubber, coconut oil, gutta-percha, quinine, and other industrial raw materials.

Our coastal ports that can dock 10,000-ton to 20,000-ton giant ships are only in places like Zhanjiang, Xiamen, Qingdao, and Dalian. The best port in the south is Xiamen, whose transportation line to Southeast Asia is shorter by thousands of miles compared to Japan and shorter by thousands of miles compared to Europe and America. Soon, the railway will be laid to Xiamen, and the provinces of Central China, Southwest, and North will take Xiamen as the entrance and exit, then the overseas Chinese in various places of Southeast Asia will be more enthusiastic about introducing the trade of Chinese and foreign goods, promoting industrial production and foreign exchange, and the benefits are vast, not just Fujian Province.

**Speech by Wang Huishou**

Our country's first five-year plan specifically stipulates that heavy industry should be developed first, which is completely correct. Now I would like to talk about some situations and measures for the completion of basic construction tasks by the Ministry of Heavy Industry in terms of steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries.

Everyone knows that in the past, due to the aggression of imperialism and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, our country could not establish and develop heavy industry. Therefore, whether it is steel or non-ferrous metals, chemicals or building materials industry, the foundation is very weak. After liberation, under the help of Soviet experts, we have improved the technical level of existing enterprises, expanded the product categories of old enterprises, and according to the annual basic construction plan, we have completed the ten key projects of Anshan Steel, completed several new and expanded projects of non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and building materials. Although these industries have developed, they are still very backward. Their backwardness is not only reflected in the quantity that cannot meet the needs of national construction but also in the backwardness of technical equipment and technical level, and therefore, the variety of products is far from meeting the needs of national construction. Obviously, if we do not overcome the backward state of these industries, they cannot correctly cooperate with the development of other industries, thereby affecting the smooth development of the national economy.

How do we overcome this backward state? On the one hand, we need to improve enterprise management and improve the technical level in the factories and mines that have been put into production to increase production and add new product varieties. The experience of the past few years has proven that this is an important aspect of accelerating industrial development and improving industrial level. It is precisely because of this that we should not only pay attention to the construction of new ones but also pay attention to the work of existing production factories and mines. We need to regard the full utilization of existing production equipment capacity as an important source of improving industrial level. However, to fundamentally overcome the backward state, the more important aspect is to correctly implement the basic construction plan stipulated in the first five-year plan, to ensure the completion of the construction of several steel bases and new non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials production bases in the five-year plan on time, and to greatly improve the capacity of these types of industries. Because in our country with very backward heavy industry, to achieve socialist industrialization, it is more important to actively build many factories and mines equipped with the latest technology. We cannot rely solely on the existing few factories and mines, most of which are equipped with outdated equipment, to achieve socialist industrialization. Therefore, to overcome the backwardness of our country's industry, to achieve the overall task of the transitional period of the state, and to achieve socialist industrialization, we must build more factories and mines of steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and other industries equipped with the latest technology.

However, the construction of steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemical industries is arduous and complex. From resource exploration to design, construction, and production, it takes a relatively long time. The construction of a steel base takes about ten years from start to finish; even the construction of a medium-sized nitrogen fertilizer plant takes five to six years. These enterprises need a long time because at the beginning, the raw material base must be explored clearly, and sufficient industrial mineral quantities must be obtained before the design can begin. In the design, various design basis data and various scientific research experiments (such as mineral processing and smelting) must be available; because these enterprises need a large number of complex equipment, for example, the construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 150 million tons requires more than 15 million tons of equipment, and a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 90,000 tons requires more than 20,000 tons of equipment. The design and manufacture of these equipment all take time; because these enterprises have a large amount of complex construction and installation work, the technical requirements for construction are very strict. A steel plant with an annual output of 150 million tons covers an area of 5 square kilometers, and within the plant area, more than 1 million square meters of workshops and warehouses, more than 100 kilometers of railways, several hundred kilometers of water supply and drainage, and various pipelines must be built. The completion of these projects requires considerable time; and all the projects, especially the foundation projects, metal structure projects, and equipment installation projects, are technically complex and require strictness. A factory only uses 33,000 cubic meters of concrete and 1,000 tons of steel bars for a single equipment base, and the accuracy of the center line of the equipment base does not allow any deviation. Mastering these technical projects requires time.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry, during the first five-year plan period, faces mainly such basic construction projects that are designed by the Soviet Union, technically complex, and modern factories and mines. These are projects that we have never built before, and some of them we have not even seen before. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we have worked and learned at the same time, although we have basically completed the national basic construction plan, but the work volume completed in the past two years is only a small part of the five-year plan, and there are still many important projects that need to be completed in the next three years. This shows that the basic construction tasks in the next three years are heavy.

To ensure the completion of the basic construction tasks assigned to the Ministry of Heavy Industry by the five-year plan, what specific measures should be taken? What problems are facing us now? How to overcome the shortcomings and errors in basic construction and improve the efficiency of basic construction work? Our experience and knowledge are very limited. Based on the practice and work situation of the past two years, we believe that the problems facing the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in addition to implementing the frugality instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, resolutely overcoming the many serious wastes in our work, and making this work a regular and important work, now require us to solve the following problems: actively explore resources and prepare raw material bases; strengthen the overall planning and mutual cooperation of basic construction; improve the design level and learn to design as a whole; organize construction enterprises to transform from civil construction to industrial construction. I will now explain some of my understandings and the measures we are taking on these issues.

First, the construction of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy industries, as well as their scale and speed of development, first depends on geological resources. Without a large number of iron ore and manganese ore that meet industrial requirements and sufficient non-ferrous metal resources, the development of steel industry and non-ferrous metallurgy industry is impossible. The development of industries such as cement, glass, sulfuric acid, and phosphate fertilizer also requires reliable and industrially suitable resources. At present, in our basic construction, the first problem we encounter and need to solve is this problem of how to prepare the raw material base. After liberation, especially since the beginning of the five-year plan, our country has carried out a large number of geological exploration work, thus initially providing geological resources for the mining of steel enterprises and several non-ferrous metal mines. However, due to the weak geological work in our country in the past, low technical level, especially the lack of economic geology work, many resources have not been explored clearly; some metals have not found a reliable base; some metals currently have insufficient reserves to meet the construction requirements of factories and mines; some metals, although there is a certain amount of reserves in coastal areas, cannot meet the current requirements of the distribution of national industrial regions, and the regions where we need to build factories currently have not yet obtained various resources to build factories and mines. In our future work, we must solve this important problem. This depends on the joint efforts of the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Heavy Industry to strengthen geological surveys to provide the necessary and industrially distributed raw material bases. For this purpose, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has used a great deal of effort in recent years to gather a geological exploration team, which is currently conducting surveys in various places. However, because the scientific and technological level is still low, the quality of the work is also low; geological reports often cannot be submitted on time; the comprehensive research of mining areas is poor, and the comprehensive utilization of metals is also not paid enough attention, so often in the case of multiple metals coexisting, we only explore one metal, without paying attention to the fact that there are still many other important metals. To correct these shortcomings, we are now paying attention to improving the ideological level of geological work personnel and learning from the experience of Soviet geological work to strengthen geological exploration work, to improve the quality of exploration design, improve comprehensive research work, strictly work according to the exploration procedure, submit the industrial mineral quantities needed for construction on time, to ensure the provision of raw material bases for the current construction of steel, non-ferrous metal, and other industries, and to create raw material bases for the construction of more steel and non-ferrous metal factories and mines in the future.

Second, when starting construction with the raw material base, the first problem that needs to be correctly handled is: overall planning and organizational mutual cooperation. Due to the long time required for the construction of heavy industry enterprises, complex technology, in the entire construction process, from the formulation of the plan, geological exploration, scientific research and experiments, the compilation of design, the supply of equipment and materials, the progress of construction and installation engineering, the preparation of production work, to the solution of water and electricity, transportation, is a very complex process, so these works are not carried out by a single unit, but must be carried out by many units responsible for different aspects. In the past, we did not fully understand the complexity of basic construction, so we lacked detailed overall planning, often due to the fact that a unit's work was not considered carefully or a small matter was not considered, it delayed the construction time. For example, we once stipulated the time for a mine to be put into production in the plan, but did not simultaneously stipulate the deadline for the geological exploration department to complete the mineral quantity, resulting in the late submission of the mineral quantity and the inability to start the design on time, and the construction time had to be delayed; sometimes the geological department explored the necessary mineral quantity, but the scientific research and experimental work did not timely conduct mineral processing and smelting experiments and research on the ore, resulting in the delay of the next step of work. Due to poor planning and cooperation, the design could not be submitted on time, the equipment and materials could not be matched with the construction, thus affecting the progress of the project. Due to poor planning and cooperation, the production preparation was not done in time, thus causing the already completed project to not be able to be put into production normally. Two important projects of Anshan Steel have had such situations: one project did not pay attention to the preparation of a kind of ball bearing, and another project did not pay attention to a special lubricating oil needed for installation and operation, resulting in the two projects having to take emergency measures when they were completed, using airplanes to transport the missing ball bearings and lubricating oil. In the past two years, some of our projects have not been put into production on time, in addition to a part being objective reasons, most are caused by insufficient overall planning and mutual cooperation. Learning from the experience and lessons of the past, to ensure the on-time production of industrial construction, it is necessary to establish the work of the construction unit (commonly known as the client). The construction unit must be responsible for the overall planning and organization of the entire construction from beginning to end and the mutual cooperation of all aspects, formulate the overall progress plan according to the time and requirements stipulated by the state plan, and organize the relevant units to arrange their work according to the overall progress plan. This is to organize a series of related works from the design to the production, so that they are interconnected and completed in the specified time for each stage of work.

Third, with a certain raw material base, when starting construction, the first problem that needs to be correctly handled is: overall planning and organizational mutual cooperation. Due to the long time required for the construction of heavy industry enterprises, complex technology, in the entire construction process, from the formulation of the plan, geological exploration, scientific research and experiments, the compilation of design, the supply of equipment and materials, the progress of construction and installation engineering, the preparation of production work, to the solution of water and electricity, transportation, is a very complex process, so these works are not carried out by a single unit, but must be carried out by many units responsible for different aspects. In the past, we did not fully understand the complexity of basic construction, so we lacked detailed overall planning, often due to the fact that a unit's work was not considered carefully or a small matter was not considered, it delayed the construction time. For example, we once stipulated the time for a mine to be put into production in the plan, but did not simultaneously stipulate the deadline for the geological exploration department to complete the mineral quantity, resulting in the late submission of the mineral quantity and the inability to start the design on time, and the construction time had to be delayed; sometimes the geological department explored the necessary mineral quantity, but the scientific research and experimental work did not timely conduct mineral processing and smelting experiments and research on the ore, resulting in the delay of the next step of work. Due to poor planning and cooperation, the design could not be submitted on time, the equipment and materials could not be matched with the construction, thus affecting the progress of the project. Due to poor planning and cooperation, the production preparation was not done in time, thus causing the already completed project to not be able to be put into production normally. Two important projects of Anshan Steel have had such situations: one project did not pay attention to the preparation of a kind of ball bearing, and another project did not pay attention to a special lubricating oil needed for installation and operation, resulting in the two projects having to take emergency measures when they were completed, using airplanes to transport the missing ball bearings and lubricating oil. In the past two years, some of our projects have not been put into production on time, in addition to a part being objective reasons, most are caused by insufficient overall planning and mutual cooperation. Learning from the experience and lessons of the past, to ensure the on-time production of industrial construction, it is necessary to establish the work of the construction unit (commonly known as the client). The construction unit must be responsible for the overall planning and organization of the entire construction from beginning to end and the mutual cooperation of all aspects, formulate the overall progress plan according to the time and requirements stipulated by the state plan, and organize the relevant units to arrange their work according to the overall progress plan. This is to organize a series of related works from the design to the production, so that they are interconnected and completed in the specified time for each stage of work.

Third, with a certain raw material base and a correct construction plan, if there is no correct design, it is still not possible to build or build well. Because the design work plays a decisive role in whether an enterprise's construction is technically and economically reasonable. However, the weakness and low level of design work are precisely a serious problem in the current construction. In the first five-year plan, the industrial construction projects undertaken by the Ministry of Heavy Industry are mainly designed by the Soviet Union, but there are still a considerable number of designs carried out by ourselves under the guidance of Soviet experts. For example, if calculated by investment, the designs commissioned by the Soviet Union account for about 60% of the total investment, and the designs by ourselves account for about 40%. Therefore, ensuring the timely completion of these design projects is of great significance to the completion of the five-year plan. To undertake the current design tasks, in recent years, we have initially gathered design forces, established four design institutes, and carried out some civil construction designs in addition to some industrial designs. However, our design work is still very backward, and this backwardness is particularly reflected in the fact that we still do not know how to carry out comprehensive design. Due to the low design level of various design institutes in the past, none of them have carried out large and complex industrial designs, and they can only design a workshop or a part of a factory or mine; or they can only design technical designs but cannot correctly plan the design tasks and preliminary designs; many major technical and economic principles cannot be correctly determined. Therefore, the problem facing the Ministry of Heavy Industry is: it is necessary to learn to carry out comprehensive design in a few years. This year, we have begun to design 55 new projects, and these designs are to be carried out comprehensively from the formulation of the plan task book, preliminary design, technical design to the construction drawings. Each design institute has Soviet experts guiding the work, and there are also many Soviet design materials. Domestic production factories and construction units are also constantly emerging new experiences, which are all favorable conditions for the design personnel to learn comprehensive design. Mobilizing the design personnel to study hard and organizing and leading them is definitely possible.

Fourth, organizing the transformation of construction enterprises from civil construction to industrial construction is another link to complete the five-year basic construction plan. Our construction team started with civil construction and small-scale industrial construction. From the large-scale rolling mill of Anshan in 1952, especially from the construction of many major projects in 1954, we began to organize the transformation of construction enterprises from civil construction to industrial construction. Due to the high technical requirements and strict quality requirements of industrial construction, the construction and installation work volume is large, and there are many special projects such as foundations, furnaces, pipelines, and metal structures, the organizational management and construction methods used in the past civil construction are no longer suitable for this industrial construction. In the past, we did not fully understand the complexity of industrial construction, and there were many shortcomings in the organization of the transformation to industrial construction, which resulted in uneven construction, quality accidents, low labor productivity, and serious waste. To meet the requirements of industrial construction, we are currently organizing specialized engineering companies (mechanical and electrical installation companies, furnace construction companies, pipeline installation companies, metal structure companies, mining construction companies, etc.) according to different technologies, so that they are proficient in specialized technologies; learn to carry out construction according to the construction operation plan like a factory; organize necessary auxiliary factories in regions; learn construction mechanization; gradually implement the unified dispatch of specialized engineering companies.

Based on the experience of the past two years, industrial construction is different from civil construction, also in that there is a large amount of preparatory work before construction, and it is necessary to do a good job in the preparatory work before construction. The construction of a heavy industry enterprise requires three to four months or half a year of preparation before starting work, and the construction with a large and complex work volume requires one year or more of preparation time. In the preparation process, it is necessary to compile the overall construction progress plan, do the construction organization design, solve the problems of water and electricity, transportation, determine the construction plan, prepare the construction materials, arrange the construction force, and learn the construction drawings. Only when these works are done well, there will be no phenomenon of stopping work halfway, and the quality can be guaranteed.

Due to the fact that the construction of a factory or mine is carried out by many specialized engineering companies, a construction site often has five or six companies and dozens of different types of work from the roof to the ground at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of construction work. Each engineering company should cooperate with each other and create conditions for each other, which requires the civil engineering company (the main contractor) to take the lead, organize various specialized engineering companies to jointly formulate a comprehensive operation plan, and command the actions of various engineering companies on a construction site in a unified manner. Without this unified command, there will be mutual interference, and it will not be possible to guarantee the completion of the project on time.

These are some of the specific measures we are currently taking in basic construction.

Finally, it should be specially pointed out that the enemy hates our socialist industrial construction and will definitely try every means to sabotage it. The exposure of the conspiracy of Pan Hannan and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, as well as the capture of other counter-revolutionary incidents, tell us that there are counter-revolutionary elements hidden in factories, mines, and basic construction enterprises, who use various disguises and exploit various weaknesses in our work to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. A few days ago, an important project was found to have attempted to sabotage underground pipelines. If we do not eliminate these hidden counter-revolutionary elements from factories, mines, construction and installation enterprises, and enterprise organs, we will not be able to carry out basic construction smoothly. Therefore, we must correct the wrong tendency of burying oneself in business and not asking about politics, raise vigilance, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to protect our basic construction.

The construction of heavy industry is difficult, and it also requires our long-term hard work. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the State Council, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. The practice of the past two years has proven that the working class can show boundless wisdom under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, we have a factor that plays a great role in construction, which is the selfless help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts. Under the direct help of Soviet experts, the technical personnel in various aspects of basic construction have made great progress. We have completed some arduous projects, and we will learn to build more arduous projects from the Soviet experts. In the past, a Japanese technician at Anshan once sneered: "If you want to restore Anshan to its original level, to be honest, you need twenty years." Now we can confidently say that under the help of Soviet experts, we will not need half the time he said, and we will not only restore it to its original level but also greatly exceed its original level at a higher technical level. Of course, in the completion of the state's great five-year plan, our responsibility is heavy. Therefore, we must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, study Marxism-Leninism diligently, pay attention to political and ideological work, work diligently, and guard against arrogance and complacency. We mobilize all employees to work hard. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the State Council, with the direct help of Soviet experts, relying on the enthusiasm of the masses, we will definitely complete the tasks assigned to us by the first five-year plan.

**Speech by Zhang Boqun**

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan." This plan is a program of decisive significance led by the Communist Party of China for the struggle to realize the overall task of the transitional period, and it is a great plan that guides the people of the whole country to advance along the socialist road, making our country prosperous and strong and the people happy. In this plan, the efforts and goals of all personnel in the transportation and postal industry are clearly indicated, and the principles and tasks are clearly stipulated. The plan stipulates the necessary investment for the transportation and postal industry, and the state will use 19.2% of the total basic construction investment for transportation and postal industry. This investment ratio is determined based on the current national economic conditions and is very appropriate. Everyone knows that the development of the transportation industry is to make transportation adapt to the development of national economic construction, industrial and agricultural production, the expansion of commodity circulation, and the needs of the people. Therefore, we should not only complete the basic construction plan within five years but also strictly implement and complete the production indicators and financial remittance tasks of transportation. According to the plan stipulation: the turnover of goods on inland waterways within five years should increase by 321.5%, the turnover of goods on coastal waterways should increase by 190.5%, the total deadweight tonnage of inland and coastal ships (including joint ventures) should increase by 400,000 tons, the turnover of goods transported by motor vehicles on highways should increase by 373.5%, and 10,100 kilometers of highways should be built, with an increase of more than 7,100 kilometers of new roads. These production and construction figures are in line with the needs of the state and the current and future growth of production capacity.

From the requirements and development speed of the five-year plan for the transportation sector, the tasks are heavy, but we have the confidence to complete them. In fact, this plan has been implemented since 1953 and has been in operation for more than two years. The implementation of the two-year plan is good. First, we have implemented the speed required for the production indicators of the transportation sector in the first five-year plan. From 1953 to 1954, the two-year water and automobile transport completed the turnover of goods has exceeded the average speed stipulated in the five-year plan by 8% to 20%; the basic construction investment of water and road transport has reached 41% of the total stipulated in the five-year plan. Second, the management of state-owned water transport enterprises has been improved to some extent. The labor productivity of inland and coastal transport in 1954 increased by 42.5% compared to 1952, and the cost was reduced by 30%. There are already 136 private shipping companies reorganized into 17 joint ventures. If only the direct management of the Ministry of Transportation is considered for inland and coastal transport, then the economic composition of water transport enterprises has changed significantly: in the total tonnage of ships, state-owned enterprises account for 62%, joint ventures account for 36.4%, and private enterprises account for only 1.6%. The total mileage of highways in the country has reached 142,000 kilometers by 1954, an increase of 9.9% compared to 1952. The Kangding Road and Qinghai-Tibet Highway have been completed, and many important national defense economic lines have been completed. Various local roads have also been improved. For example, in the past four years, Jixian County in Hebei Province organized the masses to take materials locally to repair and maintain roads, a total of 262 kilometers of roads were repaired, making it possible for local specialties and daily necessities from outside the county to be transported smoothly. In some areas of Shandong Province, the original dirt roads were improved by using various different soils and stones in the area, reaching more than 600 kilometers, and the cost was low, the effect was good, and the transportation efficiency was greatly improved. Here, it is particularly worth mentioning that from my inspection of transportation work for 90 days, traveling through more than ten provinces and cities, I deeply feel that the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and the broad masses in the labor front, and the timely help of Soviet experts, plus the diligent efforts of local cadres at all levels, full of vigor and vitality, seriously implementing the tasks given by the superiors, all these have become the political and organizational guarantee for the achievements of all our undertakings. Therefore, we have the confidence to complete and strive to complete ahead of schedule the specific tasks assigned to the transportation sector by the first five-year plan.

But on the other hand, we must also recognize that the tasks in the transportation sector in the first five-year plan are heavy, and to ensure the completion and strive to complete ahead of schedule these tasks, we must make more efforts and must seriously overcome many shortcomings and difficulties in the current work.

First, the overall planning and comprehensive arrangement of waterway and road transport work are very insufficient, and the specific guidance and help for local transportation work are lacking. This is first reflected in the lack of overall arrangement of transportation tools. For example, the transport capacity in the northwestern provinces is insufficient, while the transport capacity in coastal provinces and cities is surplus, and the leadership did not timely and deeply understand the situation and achieve unified and reasonable allocation. Second, it is reflected in the lack of specific plans and help for the repair of local roads, and the importance of repairing some roads and bridges that are urgently needed by local people and cost little money is not enough. For example, the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, due to poor transportation conditions, the transportation of grain requires a large number of laborers, and the requirement to participate in the construction of roads as laborers was proposed. The representatives of Hubei, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces at this conference also proposed the construction of roads in their respective regions. After the conference, the transportation department should pay more attention to this aspect. Again, most local ferry crossings are still in a state of no management. For example, the ferry in Qiyang County, Hunan Province, once capsized due to overloading, drowning many people. In addition, the transformation and proper arrangement of private transport enterprises are not enough, and there are still some exclusion phenomena in individual areas, producing the above problems. The main reason for these problems is that our leadership has focused on direct businesses and relaxed local transportation, focused on state-owned enterprises and relaxed private enterprises, focused on modern enterprises and neglected folk transportation tools. We have not achieved an overall arrangement of various transportation tools, timely solving the problems that need to be solved locally.

Second, the maritime transport sector still has many maritime accidents, the cost is still high, and the potential of existing equipment has not been fully utilized. In recent years, the water transport sector has been fighting against maritime accidents, but maritime accidents are still serious. Last year, only the Yangtze River and coastal areas had 908 maritime incidents, and there were more than 2,600 cargo damage and cargo difference incidents in inland rivers and coastal transport in 1954.

The reasons for many maritime accidents and cargo damage are, on the one hand, due to weak political and ideological leadership, insufficient education, and insufficient technical management, some crew members do not follow the navigation rules, and labor discipline is lax; on the other hand, the political situation of the personnel in the transportation department is extremely complex. Although democratic reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries have been carried out in the past, the cleanup has not been thorough; the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, thieves, embezzlers, and smugglers hidden in the transportation department are still very serious. This should alert us to be vigilant and further do a good job in the cleanup work.

In addition, the service attitude of the crew and drivers on ships and cars is poor, the equipment is bad, especially the shortage of passenger ships on the Yangtze River, and the passengers are crowded. The Ministry of Transportation deeply regrets this and will make great efforts to improve it in the future.

Third, there is a lot of waste in highway construction. Due to the blind pursuit of high standards, the one-sided emphasis on technical standard grades, the detachment from the principle of economic applicability, the lack of careful calculation of costs, and the serious waste. For example, the Chengdu to Aba line in Sichuan has a very small volume of goods but is built according to the fifth-grade road standard, with a construction cost of more than 60,000 yuan per kilometer. Some individual lines in the South China region, due to the insistence on straight lines, have a construction cost of more than 90,000 yuan per kilometer. In other highway construction, due to the rush to complete tasks, neglecting thrift and engineering quality, lack of financial supervision and technical supervision, a lot of waste was also caused, and the indirect expenses of some units reached more than 30%. This tendency of detachment from reality and neglect of the economy is seriously existent. Currently, the highway system is carrying out an anti-waste campaign, adhering to the principle of "spending less money to build more roads," and based on specific conditions, trying to use local materials as much as possible and reduce costs.

To successfully complete the first five-year plan, we should do the following work:

First, implement the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangement for various transportation tools. Our country has various types of transportation tools with different economic properties, which should be allocated according to the types, flow, and specific requirements of goods for transportation, combined with the characteristics and distribution of transportation tools, to reasonably allocate the transportation tasks of various transportation tools, to give full play to the role of all transportation tools, and to provide the country with large quantities, high-quality, low-cost, and safe and fast transportation power. For this, the Ministry of Transportation must strengthen economic investigation in the future, understand the situation of goods sources and flow, constantly study the laws of national economic development, and grasp the use of various transportation tools nationwide. It is also necessary to fully utilize the excellent conditions of water transport in our country under the principle of prioritizing railway transport, to give full play to the role of water transport. The role of automobiles (including enterprise automobiles) and wooden sailboats, animal-drawn carts, and other transportation tools in regional short-distance transportation is great. In addition to meeting the transportation needs of industrial bases and cities, they should face rural areas and adapt to the transportation needs of primary markets. Actively implement water-land combined transport, river-sea combined transport, and direct transport, and gradually organize the national transportation network in steps. In addition, through joint ventures and the road of cooperation, the socialist transformation of capitalist transportation industry and the road of cooperation, the socialist transformation of individual transportation industry should be gradually carried out, and they should be brought into the state plan track.

Second, strengthen local transportation work. Since 1953, after being approved by the State Council, local transportation has been managed by local authorities, and various local parties and governments have strengthened their leadership, completed a huge transportation task, and done a lot of construction work. But due to the cancellation of the regional structure, the coordination of transportation between provinces and provinces, the formulation and revision of regulations and technical standards, and the formulation and revision of regulations and technical standards, all need to be gradually solved. Especially the development and coordination of various types of transportation tools in local areas need to be comprehensively arranged, so as to give full play to their role in short-distance transportation. It is also necessary to strengthen the maintenance of roads and waterways, formulate local road standards, utilize local labor and materials, and repair some roads suitable for local transportation tools, and improve the road conditions of some roads with large traffic volume; or adopt state subsidies

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 22nd.

**Report of the Ministry of Communications**

The Ministry of Communications has outlined its plans for the next few years, focusing on several key areas:

1. **Road and Waterway Construction**: The ministry will prioritize the construction of significant roads and waterways, especially those with national defense and economic importance. This includes the construction of major highways, bridges, and ferries that are essential for local transportation needs. Additionally, efforts will be made to improve the management of waterways and ports, ensuring the safety and efficiency of transportation.

2. **Improving Enterprise Management**: The ministry aims to enhance the management and operational efficiency of existing enterprises. This involves strengthening economic and technical standards, implementing comprehensive planning, and adopting economic accounting systems. Various reforms in production and technology will be carried out based on the specific conditions of each enterprise. Economic surveys will be conducted, and business operations will be strengthened to ensure the quality of transportation and reduce losses.

3. **Efficient Use of State Investments**: The ministry will focus on using state investments effectively, ensuring that funds are allocated to increase transportation capacity. For water transportation, the focus will be on the Yangtze River, while also considering other inland waterways. Coastal areas will prioritize meeting national defense and foreign trade needs, including the completion of the Zhanjiang port and the expansion of maritime facilities. The ministry will also plan ship types, build technologically advanced steam-powered ships, and improve ports and navigation channels.

4. **Public Road Construction**: The ministry will concentrate on building major national defense and economic routes, reducing construction costs while ensuring quality. Local resources and manpower will be utilized to maintain existing roads and construct infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and ferries that meet local transportation needs.

5. **Training of Personnel**: The ministry will train various specialized technical and management personnel according to the development plan of the transportation industry. Through various forms of study, the political and technical skills of in-service personnel will be improved, ensuring that they become the backbone of the transportation industry after several years of training and practice.

The above five tasks are the ministry's long-term goals. In executing these tasks, the ministry will first strengthen political and ideological work, conduct extensive socialist education, and enhance the revolutionary enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of all employees. The ministry will also thoroughly reorganize its personnel, eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements and criminals from the water and road systems, and prevent sabotage by enemy agents. The ministry will promote increased production, frugality, and anti-waste movements among the masses to ensure that state investments are used effectively. The ministry will fully implement the "safe production" policy, oppose all negligent attitudes and practices towards safety, and learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to improve the business and technical skills of employees. The ministry will mobilize all employees of the Ministry of Communications to exhibit initiative and creativity, strengthen labor discipline, and launch labor competitions to continuously improve labor productivity and reduce costs, striving to achieve the great success of China's first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Ma Xulun**

I fully support the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China," the "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River and Developing Water Resources," the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," and the "Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China." I am committed to ensuring their complete implementation.

Our first Five-Year Plan outlines a bright and beautiful future for our country, clearly indicating the direction for the efforts of every citizen. It is our guiding principle and the driving force for our progress. Its greatest feature is that it regulates the investment ratios of various sectors based on the principle of prioritizing heavy industry, ensuring the gradual growth and leadership of socialist economic factors. The plan's construction scale is vast, the speed is fast, and the production targets are advanced; at the same time, it is practical and in line with the specific situation, making it completely necessary and possible. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the united efforts of the entire Chinese people, and with the support of the brotherly countries led by the Soviet Union and the world's peace forces, we will definitely complete and even exceed the targets of this great plan.

However, we must recognize that achieving the Five-Year Plan is a monumental task. In the current domestic and international environment, it is a form of class struggle. Our victory is the enemy's defeat. Our joy and excitement are the enemy's fear and trembling. The enemy will not accept their defeat and will try every means to sabotage the implementation of our Five-Year Plan. Recent revelations of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident and various counter-revolutionary cases in different regions are proof of this. Therefore, as we strive to implement the first Five-Year Plan, we must fully enhance our revolutionary vigilance, identify and expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and suppress them decisively. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries harbor deep hatred for the revolution, even saying, "It is pus, it must be expelled." I believe we must "repay them in their own coin." We must expel the Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries and any other hidden counter-revolutionaries, just as we expel pus, thoroughly and cleanly!

From the Hu Feng incident, I have a deeper understanding of the significance of Chairman Mao's words: "Thought reform, first of all, the thought reform of various intellectuals, is an important condition for thorough democratic reform and gradual industrialization in various aspects of our country." The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng faction have exploited the weaknesses and flaws in the thoughts of some intellectuals to achieve part of their evil goals. Therefore, for us, enhancing revolutionary vigilance obviously has two meanings: on the one hand, to learn to have a keen political sense and be good at identifying any hidden counter-revolutionaries; on the other hand, to be vigilant of oneself, to examine one's words and deeds, and to ensure that there are no opportunities for counter-revolutionaries to exploit. Especially for us intellectuals who grew up in the old society, we should not hide the fact that there are many flaws and serious neglect of politics in our thoughts. These flaws often unconsciously conflict with socialist thoughts. If we do not remain vigilant and strive to reform ourselves, we will hinder the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan and harm our socialist construction and transformation. Facts have proven that the enemy is always looking for ways to exploit this. If we do not seriously face this, we will fall into the enemy's trap and face the danger of sinking into the mire. Behavior and thoughts that are not conducive to socialism are what the enemy likes. What the enemy likes, we must resolutely not do!

Our old saying goes, "Indulgence only breeds more evil, and neglecting a small wound can lead to a big problem." I quote this here with two meanings. One meaning is that any counter-revolutionary must be severely suppressed and in no way indulged, otherwise, being kind to the enemy is cruel to the people. Another meaning is that we must seriously and diligently carry out self-reform. For our own flaws and errors in thought, we should courageously and continuously examine and correct them, and in no way indulge in them, otherwise, it will be painful for friends and joyful for enemies. In "On the Coalition Government," Chairman Mao taught us:

"Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making us feel sad whenever we think of them. Can we still not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our errors?" Chairman Mao's words deeply move me. The noble qualities of a Communist should be the direction we all strive to learn. Although I am still ill, seeing that our motherland is heading towards an infinitely magnificent and vast future, my mood has never been as happy and excited as it is now. I will definitely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, together with the masses I am connected with, study hard, enhance vigilance, strengthen unity, and dedicate all my strength to consolidating the people's democratic united front, for the great cause of socialism in our motherland.

**Speech by Jiang Xueshan**

We have seen from the reports of Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, on the "Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River and Developing Water Resources," and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, on the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," the magnificent socialist construction that is unfolding and about to unfold, and the prosperous and happy future of our great motherland. This has greatly inspired us. At the same time, we also know that such a large-scale economic construction is being carried out under the condition of being surrounded by imperialism. The enemy is extremely hostile to our socialist construction. As a soldier, after listening to these reports, I deeply feel that our responsibility and mission in defending the peaceful labor of the people of our country are extremely honorable and extremely important.

Now, the People's Liberation Army of China is advancing towards modernization. The implementation of the compulsory military service system is an important measure for the construction of a modern national defense army. We wholeheartedly support the report of Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense, on the "Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China."

In the 1954 trial conscription according to the principles of the compulsory military service system, the superiority of the compulsory military service system has already become very obvious. For example, due to the implementation of the compulsory military service system, the number of standing troops can be reduced, and military expenses can be saved; various regular systems of the army can be smoothly implemented; military officers will regard military work as a long-term or even lifelong career; the series of problems such as the service, treatment, marriage, and family of soldiers will gradually be reasonably solved, so both military officers and soldiers are enthusiastically supportive. Demobilized personnel said: "Back home, we will work hard to participate in production and construction, support the liberation of Taiwan, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time." Soldiers who continue to serve said: "We will ensure to bring up new recruits and undertake the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending the motherland." After new recruits arrive at the unit, they can quickly adapt to military life under the education of officers and the help of old soldiers, and have made significant progress in military learning in the first half of this year. In the company, new and old soldiers are united and friendly, full of vitality. After the implementation of the compulsory military service system, a large number of young people will be conscripted every year. We need to train them to become defenders of the motherland with high political awareness and familiar with military technology. We need to rely on officers to conduct strict education and training for them carefully and patiently. Therefore, the responsibility of officers is heavier. We must all study hard, improve ourselves, and better educate and train the troops. We must make every young person who comes to the great school of the People's Liberation Army of China become a brave soldier in the unit; when they demobilize and return to their hometowns after their service, they will become the backbone of the production front.

My unit is stationed on the front line of national defense. Every achievement in the construction of our motherland gives us great encouragement. Soldiers like to compare our motherland to a beautiful garden and themselves to gatekeepers. Everyone feels that being a gatekeeper of the motherland's garden is an extremely honorable task. We love peace, we have never had and will never have the intention to invade other countries, but we will never allow any invaders to break into our motherland's garden and disrupt our peaceful labor. We are always vigilant, never complacent, and we enthusiastically support the rapid implementation of the compulsory military service system, strengthen national defense forces, and never relax for a moment to intensify military training and political learning, improve our military skills, tactics, and ideological level, and resolutely fight for the liberation of our own territory, Taiwan, and for the defense of our country's independence and world peace.

**Speech by Baolihan**

I have listened to the reports of Li Fuchun, Vice Premier, on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier, on the "Draft of the Law on Military Service of the People's Republic of China," Deng Zihui, Vice Premier, on the "Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River and Developing Water Resources," and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman, on the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." I believe these reports fully reflect the interests and demands of the entire Chinese people. Therefore, I fully support these five reports and am willing to work hard for their thorough implementation.

The thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang suffered long-term exploitation and oppression under the bloodthirsty rule of a small group of reactionary ruling classes before liberation, and there was deep mistrust and hatred among the ethnic groups, which led to many ethnic massacres in history, resulting in severe damage to the economy and culture, making it long-term backward. But under the oppression, the various ethnic peoples united to fight against the reactionary ruling classes and finally gained liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

After liberation, the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government vigorously implemented the Party's and Mao Zedong's policies on ethnic minorities, and the various ethnic peoples obtained equal political rights. Ethnic relations have fundamentally changed, and the various ethnic peoples have become closely united. On the basis of ethnic unity, we have carried out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, reforming the land system, supporting the Korean War, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis" campaigns, and improved the political awareness and initiative of the various ethnic peoples, developing various production and cultural education undertakings. Agricultural production has increased by 65.4% compared to 1949; livestock has increased by 45, and the price of livestock products has increased by 64 compared to before liberation. For example, in 1949, 170 kilograms of sheep wool could be exchanged for one piece of fine cloth, while in 1952, 29 kilograms of sheep wool could be exchanged for one piece of white fine cloth. Water conservancy has increased by 130%; various industrial products have increased by 36 times, and the sales volume of cloth has increased by 6.9 times compared to before liberation. In the past six years, 34,000 ethnic cadres have been trained in the province, the number of primary school students has increased by 76.2%, the number of middle school students has tripled, and the number of higher education students has tripled. The province now has 137 hospitals, clinics, and other prevention and treatment institutions, and the number of beds has doubled compared to 1950. Laborers who were starving and cold before liberation can now wear fine cloth and eat oil, meat, and sugar. For example, in 1950, 1,200 tons of sugar could not be sold, while in 1954, 4,064 tons of sugar were still not enough to supply.

These achievements were obtained under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao, the exemplary and encouraging spirit of hard work in production and construction by the PLA stationed in Xinjiang, and the help of various ethnic peoples, as well as the selfless help of the friendly Soviet Union, which helped us as much as it did in other parts of the country. Due to these achievements, conditions have been created for the implementation of regional ethnic autonomy in the Xinjiang region. So far, five autonomous prefectures and six autonomous counties have been established in the province, and the "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region" will be established this autumn. In areas where ethnic autonomous organs have been established, the right of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own houses has been realized, and a more prosperous new situation has been presented. This is mainly manifested in:

1. Further strengthening ethnic unity. Ethnic autonomous regions implement ethnic autonomy, and they all follow the example of the Han and Uyghur peoples in taking care of and helping other ethnic minorities, actively uniting and helping the ethnic minorities within the autonomous region. Similarly, the ethnic minorities within the autonomous region are also more closely united. For example, in the Chabuchar Xibe Autonomous County, in the past, the Xibe people did not want to participate in the locust control when they caught locusts, and said: "The fields are all Xibe people's, we are herdsmen, this has nothing to do with us." But after the establishment of the autonomous county, 300-plus Huis from six districts voluntarily helped to catch locusts and said to the Xibe people: "Catching locusts is not just your business, we also have a responsibility." In the seventh district, 500-plus Huis helped the Xibe farmers to harvest and thresh.

2. Enhancing the initiative of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own houses. After the establishment of autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties, the enthusiasm of various ethnic peoples for production mutual aid has generally increased. For example, in the Kezilesu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, the number of livestock in 1954 increased by 21.4% compared to 1953, and the survival rate of young livestock reached 98%, the highest in history.

3. Strengthening the connection between the government and the people. After the establishment of the autonomous county, a large number of active elements from ethnic minorities and leaders who have contact with the masses participated in the work of the autonomous organs, and many took on leading roles. In the eleven autonomous prefectures and counties, 266 government committee members are local ethnic minorities, accounting for 84.6%, and 34 prefecture and county heads are ethnic minorities, accounting for 76.6%. The autonomous organs use their own ethnic languages and scripts to perform their duties. The Xibe people said emotionally: "During the reactionary rule, we didn't even dare to speak our own ethnic language. Now the Communist Party advocates our language and script, helps us develop, and ethnic regional autonomy is indeed a good policy."

4. Enhancing the patriotic spirit of the ethnic peoples. After ethnic autonomy, the ethnic minorities actively responded to the call to support the great cause of socialist industrialization and the liberation of our country's territory, Taiwan. They deeply understood that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of ethnic minorities and the creators of happy lives, and they have unlimited trust and deep affection for the Party and Chairman Mao. They said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao treat ethnic minorities like their own children. Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can give ethnic minorities the right to be masters of their own houses. In the future, only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we move towards prosperity and happiness."

The above examples fully illustrate the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong's policies on ethnic minorities. However, it cannot be denied that there are many shortcomings in the preparatory work for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. The propaganda and education work on the significance of ethnic autonomy is not deep enough, resulting in some people's insufficient understanding of the superiority of ethnic autonomy. For example, some people say: "Under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, ethnic minorities already have equal rights, so why is it necessary to implement ethnic autonomy now?"

Based on the above situation, after the establishment of the "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region," we must further strengthen the propaganda and education of patriotism and internationalism, continue to consolidate and develop the brotherly friendship between ethnic minorities, and under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, with the great help of the Han people, vigorously develop the economy and culture of the autonomous region, and gradually eliminate the actual inequality left over from history.

At this time when the ethnic peoples of the whole country are striving for the great cause of socialist construction in our motherland, counter-revolutionaries are carrying out sabotage activities everywhere, trying to overthrow the people's regime. To defend the fruits of the people's revolution, we suggest that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks be completely and thoroughly eliminated and severely suppressed. At the same time, the ethnic peoples should enhance their vigilance and expose the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries at any time, so that our motherland's construction cause can advance victoriously.

After the establishment of the "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region," to ensure that the ethnic peoples can truly exercise their autonomy rights, we will formulate various single regulations within the autonomous region according to the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the local ethnic minorities. But this is a new task, and we lack experience. We request the Central Government and relevant departments to provide more help and guidance.

Finally, I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the ethnic peoples of Xinjiang will be full of confidence and, together with the people of the whole country, strive to liberate our country's territory, Taiwan, to complete and exceed the first Five-Year Plan and socialist construction, and to defend the peace of Asia and the world.

**Speech by Lin Qiaozhi**

First of all, I fully agree with the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan." I am a doctor, and at the beginning, I was confused by the plan's content and the meaning of those astonishing figures, so I found it difficult to comment. However, after more than a week of small group reading, interpretation by experts, and discussion, we have studied the entire content of the draft of the first Five-Year Plan item by item, gained a lot of knowledge, and clarified many questions. Now, I think this Five-Year Plan draft is permeated with the spirit and principles of the country's tasks in the transitional period from beginning to end, and is a scientific, correct, and great plan. For example, from the proportion of state investment and the growth figures of various industrial production capacities, it can be clearly seen that the establishment of the initial foundation of socialist industrialization occupies a dominant and central position in the entire national economy. On the other hand, we can also see that the targets set for the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the five-year process are also very clear. Therefore, I fully support this plan and will strive to achieve its implementation.

The implementation of the Five-Year Plan means the rapid development of our social productive forces. Many large factories and agricultural production cooperatives are being established and organized one after another. What tasks should we medical workers undertake? I would like to express my opinions on this issue.

Generally speaking, I think our medical and health work has always lagged behind the needs. In the process of gradually implementing the Five-Year Plan, this situation of being unbalanced with the speed of economic development and the growing needs will become more and more obvious. Therefore, our task is to fight against this backward situation and catch up quickly.

First, the development of modern industry requires modern industrial hygiene science and work, such as health work in various factories, prevention and treatment of occupational diseases, etc. These are specialized fields, and we are currently far behind the needs in this regard, and the existing forces are very weak or very small. Now, in local medical colleges, the policy of facing factories and mines is clear, which is very good. In the future, the key is to concretely implement this policy. I think it is necessary to emphasize again the effort to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, because our knowledge in this area is very lacking, and we cannot catch up without doing so.

Second, the health propaganda work in factory and mine units must be strengthened and actively carried out. In the inspection work before this meeting, I saw that the improvement of sanitary conditions in factories has achieved certain results, which need to be consolidated. But I also found that some factories do not pay enough attention to the health of workers, and workers lack necessary sanitary knowledge. For example, in a printing factory in Beijing, although there are protective devices such as goggles, aprons, and gloves for welding, they are placed aside unused, and the leadership has not paid attention to this. In addition, the night shift problem in factories is urgently in need of research and solution. This shows that in factories, while machines are cherished and there is a set of methods, the care and attention given to the more precious productive force—the health of workers—is not enough, and there is still a lack of a set of methods. Therefore, we must not only require the leadership of various industrial departments or units to pay attention to this issue but also actively carry out health propaganda work among workers, using various methods such as educational films to emphasize that taking care of one's own health is an important prerequisite for ensuring production.

Third, the draft of the Five-Year Plan stipulates that the number of beds will increase by 77.2%, and the number of doctors will increase by 74.3%. This task must be completed and is possible to complete. In the draft of the Five-Year Plan, the principle of "emphasizing quality improvement and considering quantity at the same time" in training cadres is proposed, which I think is very correct. Currently, due to the urgent need, some newly graduated students from medical colleges are sent out to independently undertake tasks beyond their working capacity. Such doctors, due to lack of experience and guidance, often solve small problems but cause big problems, which is very dangerous. In the future, we should first consider the needs and size of the work and tasks to allocate cadres, correcting the shortcoming of starting from satisfying the numerical figures of the organization without guaranteeing quality.

Fourth, we must lead the vigorous development of medical scientific research work, which is closely related to improving the quality of cadres' work. In the past, scientists often conducted research work based on personal interests, looking at the conditions of their own units, and doing what they could do; from the perspective of the needs of the state and society, the collective force was not fully utilized to carry out research work, and the study and research of traditional Chinese medicine had just begun. Therefore, my opinion is that the Ministry of Health should strengthen the unified leadership of research work in the future, from the requirement of universally improving quality, carry out research work from ensuring the most needed problems in production and from promoting the essence of traditional Chinese medicine, unite Chinese and Western medicine, and jointly carry out research work. In research work, we should emphasize organizational spirit and collectivism, unite all medical workers across the country, and excellently complete the glorious task of ensuring the victory of the great Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Lin Biao**

I fully agree with and support the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun on the "Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan" and the report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget." The two reports propose that the development of China's socialist industrialization should start from our own increased production, frugality, and opposition to waste, and accumulate funds. The various policies and methods listed are correct. I am a scientific and technological worker. Based on these methods and policies, I propose several scientific and technological improvement methods to meet the government's call to increase production, frugality, and opposition to waste to accumulate funds:

1. How to rationally use national resources;
2. How to improve production technology, increase quality, and quantity.

Now, I will discuss the problem with a few specific and feasible facts.

On the first question, I propose:

1. In Shenyang, there is a tall chimney that emits sulfur dioxide, which is harmful to living organisms and needs to be discharged high into the atmosphere through the chimney. Sulfur dioxide is a raw material for producing sulfuric acid. Our country uses a large amount of sulfuric acid for sulfuric acid ammonium phosphate fertilizer, and the raw material for sulfuric acid was previously purchased at a high price from imported sulfur. The same raw material for producing sulfuric acid is discharged as waste gas into the atmosphere on one side of the smelting plant, while on the other side of the sulfuric acid ammonium phosphate plant, high-priced sulfur raw materials are sought. From the perspective of overall industrialization, this is an irrational use of national resources. Recycling chimney waste gas and using sulfur dioxide as a raw material for sulfuric acid is an early successful production project, which can utilize it as a raw material and eliminate the harm to nearby organisms. The amount of sulfur dioxide discharged by this tall chimney in Shenyang is huge every year. The amount of sulfur dioxide discharged into the atmosphere by many smelting plants across the country is even greater.

2. Our country has many super coal mines with methane (methane gas), which can be used as a raw material for carbon black. Carbon black is an indispensable reinforcing agent in the rubber industry, especially in the manufacture of tires, which can improve the physical properties of rubber and increase the service life of tires. Previously, methane in coal mines was a harmful gas, but now it has become a national defense material. Our country can produce carbon black, but the quantity and quality are far from meeting the needs of the country. We have a large amount of raw material for producing carbon black and have achieved initial success in carbon black production technology. Moreover, the investment in carbon black production equipment is not large. We have the conditions to expand production and improve quality.

On the second question, I propose:

1. Citronella grass is a grass. It is used to extract citronella oil for making perfumes, with an oil content of 2.2%. This year, the high-yield variety planted in South China covers 20,000 mu, with an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu, but the oil yield is very low, with an average of 14 taels per 100 jin of grass, which is 0.875% of the grass. The main reason for the low oil yield is poor processing and extraction technology, resulting in the loss of a large amount of oil. The condensed water from distillation contains a large amount of oil, which is discarded. The cooling system, equipment installation, furnace structure, and sun-drying of citronella grass are all unreasonable, resulting in the loss of oil and increased distillation time. Improving the above shortcomings and recycling the condensed water from distillation can not only increase the production capacity of the pot and reduce costs but also greatly improve the oil yield, which can reach 2% of the grass, i.e., 2 jin of oil per 100 jin of grass. In this way, 675,000 jin of oil can be obtained more this year, which is equivalent to 4,050,000 yuan. If the planting area is increased to 50,000 mu next year, 1,687,500 jin of oil can be obtained, which is equivalent to 10,250,000 yuan.

2. The rubber produced by the rubber trees planted in South China should be the same quality as that in South Asia, but the quality of the rubber produced in South China is very poor. This is mainly due to the lack of understanding of the chemical aspects of rubber in the processing process, and the operating methods are incorrect. Therefore, improving the processing technology does not require a significant change in equipment and investment.

3. Improving the production technology of the automobile tire industry to increase the mileage of automobile tires is of great significance. Increasing the mileage of tires can reduce the use of tires, saving the country a large amount of funds, and should be undertaken by the rubber industry department.

The improvement of science and technology plays a great role in "increasing production, frugality, and opposition to waste, accumulating funds." Each industry has its shortcomings and weaknesses. Various production departments should exchange experiences, so that each industry can improve production and quality through technological innovation. Each technical production worker, including workers, technicians, and engineers, should strive to study and improve scientific and technological improvements on the same production line, promoting the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Zhang Naiqi**

Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on the grain issue shows that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is completely correct; it is the best way to rationally allocate grain in our country at present, and it is the only way that can work. The reports from various representatives after their inspections also prove this truth.

Now, I will supplement some aspects of grain business operations.

Grain business operations include receiving into storage, storage, processing, transportation, supply, and basic construction. Most of the staff in the grain system are diligent, and most units have achievements; the shortcomings mainly lie in the fact that there are still many people among us whose thoughts are conservative and one-sided, and whose work is old-fashioned, often grasping one end and losing the other, paying attention to one side and neglecting the other, lacking the idea of comprehensive increase in production and frugality, and completing the plan comprehensively, especially the weak economic accounting viewpoint, pursuing tasks single-mindedly, and neglecting financial and cost work.

Grain work still loses a considerable amount of money every year, but the potential for increase in production and frugality in grain work is great. In the future, as long as the work is done well and combined with the gradual reasonable adjustment of prices, it is possible to achieve a state of no loss within two to three years. The serious problem is that the cost level in 1954 is not lower than in 1953, but higher, and the cost level in the first quarter of this year is higher than in the same period of 1954. Of course, there are objective reasons, mainly the severe floods last year, the tense grain supply situation in March and April this year, and the poor quality of grain stored in many places in the previous two years. But the lack of subjective effort is also very important.

The largest expenditure in costs is transportation and loading and unloading fees, accounting for almost half. Therefore, when we transport a large amount of grain to support disaster areas and supply-tight areas, the cost level immediately rises. The disaster areas last year were all historically grain-exporting areas, and the grain price is naturally lower. We need to purchase more grain from mountainous areas with difficult transportation to support disaster areas, and transport grain from distant areas such as Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest to support disaster areas. Some disaster-stricken provinces need to eat grain from as many as ten to twenty provinces. The loss in transportation and price is huge. This is something that only the people's government under the leadership of the Communist Party can do. We should calculate this loss and make the national disaster relief expenditure a comprehensive and accurate figure. The situation of supporting technical crop areas is similar, such as Hebei Province, which needs to eat grain from more than twenty provinces. The loss of grain in these areas is also very large. In addition, the tense situation caused by false cries for lack of grain often not only causes waste in grain transportation but also disrupts the plans of the grain department and even the transportation department.

The transportation volume of grain is very large. Last year, the total transportation volume was half more than the sales volume, and in some counties, it was more than twice the sales volume. About half of the transportation costs are spent on transportation below the county level. On the one hand, the proportion of manpower transportation increases as it goes down to the lower levels, making the transportation costs more expensive; on the other hand, it can also be seen that it is very important to strengthen the planning of transportation from the beginning of receiving into storage.

We grain workers, in order to transport grain to support disaster areas and stabilize the market, and to complete the task, have a great spirit. The shortcoming is that many people neglect financial and cost work. As mentioned above, grain work in many places sometimes has to lose money without hesitation. The problem is that many people misunderstand "not hesitating to lose money" as "not calculating costs." They have not realized that: losing money is also a matter of calculating costs; once costs are calculated, money that should not be lost can be saved.

We believe that as long as the "three-definite" policy can be implemented this year, the lack of grain in rural areas and the number of lack-of-grain households can be understood, and the grain supply to rural areas can be left on the spot, the transportation volume can be greatly reduced, which will greatly help to reduce the cost level.

The fundamental measure to save transportation costs is, on the basis of improving the planning of grain work and implementing the institutionalization of unified purchase and sale work, to actively promote the balanced production and sales within the region and rational transportation. This requires continuing to advocate "eating what you have," which is beneficial to the balanced production and sales within the region. The Five-Year Plan requires that provinces that cannot be self-sufficient in grain gradually achieve self-sufficiency, which is even more important. Gradually building railway dedicated lines for warehouses and gradually changing packaged transportation to bulk transportation can also greatly save loading and unloading and packaging costs.

The expenditure on storage fees is also large, accounting for one-tenth of the expenditure. The storage work has achieved results due to the attention of various levels of party and government, and the work has been done. Since last year, the promotion of pest-free warehouses and mold-free warehouses has been developed into pest-free, mold-free, rodent-free, accident-free "four-free" warehouses. This spring, a general inspection was carried out. According to the statistics of 27 provinces and cities, the proportion of pest-free grain in the inspected grain has reached 68.5%. Undoubtedly, behind this progressive percentage, there are still many backward warehouses. If we say that there are still a few percent of backward warehouses, then that is a few thousand. Some warehouse managers are indifferent to pest and mold damage, regarding it as a natural law, and are indifferent to the swarms of rats and birds, thinking that they cannot eat much. Such people, if they do not correct their mistakes quickly, will inevitably be punished by the state. In addition, in order to strive for pest-free and mold-free, there is a tendency to waste expenses, which, although severely criticized, may still exist.

The expenditure on storage fees is mainly the wages of temporary hired workers and storage supplies. Due to the seasonality of storage work, temporary hired workers are necessary; the problem is that many places do not control the number of people, and the hiring period is too long, even long-term retention. Grain storage cadres generally have the excellent style of hard work and endurance, but in recent years, due to the excessive hiring of temporary workers in many places, some cadres have been infected with the bourgeois habit of looking down on physical labor. They only issue orders, make records, and sign, leaving the more labor-intensive physical labor to temporary workers to do. The accumulation and waste of storage supplies are also quite common.

Grain warehouses must implement quota management. This year, the advanced experience of the Heilongjiang Haerbin grain warehouse must be promoted in units with conditions, requiring regions with better conditions to formulate quotas for trial implementation according to local conditions, and in general regions, first implement pre-budget control.

The three links of storage, transportation, and sales must implement the responsibility system to reduce grain loss. Due to the large volume of grain operations, an increase in loss of one ten-thousandth in each link will result in the waste of tens of millions of jin of grain; the percentage is small, but the absolute number is astonishingly large. This means that the potential for savings is great.

The processing aspect has basically reversed the tendency of excessive whitening of rice and flour, and the yield of finished products has increased significantly, thereby also improving the nutritional value; but the potential for increase in production is still great. Hunan Province adopted the suggestion of Soviet expert Klyuchkov, changing the single-machine rice milling to double-machine rice milling, increasing the yield of standard rice by 3 to 5 jin per 100 jin of paddy; Shenyang City promoted the advanced method of "separating large and small grains for processing," increasing the yield of sorghum from 70.43 jin to 74.58 jin per 100 jin; North China carried out a factory competition in flour mills, increasing the flour yield by 1 to 2%—these are specific proofs.

The potential for savings in the processing aspect is also great. Last year, the expenditure on commissioned processing fees was nearly 400 million yuan, with many unreasonable factors. For example, the ratio of the lowest to the highest flour processing fee rate in the country is 1:7; the profit rate of processing plants, except for some cities with low production capacity utilization rates due to unreasonable plant locations, is generally more than 30%, and some even reach more than 40%. After the factory competition in North China, the processing cost per bag of flour in many flour mills was reduced to 2.2 jiao, and the lowest reached 1.9 jiao, but the expenditure on processing fees was generally 4.7 jiao per bag. Due to the large profits and the influence of capitalist business ideas, the tendency to pursue increased production quantity while neglecting the yield of finished products still continues in many processing plants; from the perspective of the leaders of these processing plants, wasting some grain is not a big deal. Some have paid attention to improving the yield of finished products, but have neglected maintaining purity, resulting in sand and weeds in the rice, and dust in the flour. As a result, in addition to harming people's health, it causes waste in consumption, spitting out a grain of sand and a mouthful of rice; flour cannot be sold and is piled up, leading to mold.

For grain processing work, various technical and economic quotas and technical standards for various processed grains must be formulated. In the future, we must actively work to complete this complex task.

The task of processing work, in addition to improving the yield of finished products, must also pay attention to improving nutritional value, so that the broad masses of people can improve nutrition while saving grain, and can resist the foot disease that is prevalent in the south. As long as the three links of processing, transportation, and supply are well coordinated, fresh and high-germ rice with a large amount of germ can be supplied to the people regularly, and the promotion of not washing rice before cooking can greatly save grain, while improving the nutritional value of rice. Steamed rice is a fine production culture heritage of our country. Its characteristics are high yield, high rice yield, high nutritional value, and convenient for long-term storage; it should be summarized and promoted in combination with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Various advanced steamed rice and cooked rice methods that have emerged in various places recently should also be promoted.

The basic construction work has achieved results. The construction cost per square meter of warehouses has been reduced from 71 yuan in 1953 to 49 yuan in 1954, and further reduced to 45.5 jiao at the beginning of this year. At that time, some people said: "There is no more potential for savings, it has been saved to the extreme." After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the July directive, we found through in-depth inspection that there is still room for savings of about 10%, which is a great potential. The key is that the difference in construction costs is originally very large, with the lowest cost of warehouses at 35 yuan per square meter and the highest at 70 yuan; the difference in enterprise and government buildings is even greater, with the lowest at 27 yuan and the highest at 97 yuan. Some regions have high construction costs due to objective reasons, but in two places with similar conditions, the construction costs are very different, which can confirm that high costs are waste. The situation of budgeting high and using low exists seriously in some regions, and the profit of the construction unit (the second party) can reach seven times the planned profit. In addition, although warehouses are generally in short supply, more than half of the grain is still stored outdoors, but some places have built too many warehouses, leaving them unused. It should be said that waste still exists in all aspects.

The supply work has the most problems. This is the result of various levels of leadership in the grain system paying more attention to unified purchase and less attention to unified sale. In the second half of last year, the unified sale in rural areas was too loose, and in March and April this year, many rural areas cried out for lack of grain; but in fact, the sales volume at that time was the largest ever. The reason is that many places did not conduct in-depth investigations to distinguish between real and false lack of grain, and supplied more to those who cried louder, so that those who did not lack grain also cried for lack, resulting in a larger sales volume and louder cries for lack. After the rectification of rural unified sale work, the sales volume has been greatly reduced, and the cries for lack have basically disappeared. This change shows the truth, and also gives us a profound lesson.

The task of grain work in saving is not only to save funds, but more importantly, to save grain. Not only should grain be saved from the various business links, but also through reasonable supply, social grain consumption should be saved. The State Council instructs that various places must, before the unified purchase of autumn grain, understand the lack-of-grain households and the number of lack-of-grain in rural areas, register them in a ledger, and issue purchase certificates in advance. In the "three-definite" to households, combine purchase and sale, and once clarify the boundary of surplus and deficit, determine the supply quantity of lack-of-grain households among the agricultural population, register them in a ledger, and issue purchase certificates. Then, conduct an inspection every February and March, and solve new lack-of-grain households in time as they are found. At the same time, in the unified purchase aspect, resolutely do not buy "excess grain," and register and issue certificates separately for "circulating grain." In this way, grassroots cadres can have a clear mind and can distinguish between true and false cries at any time, and rural unified sale work can be gradually done well.

In the past period, the supply work in many cities was loosely controlled, and the purchase of grain with certificates became a formality. Therefore, the sales volume increased month by month, and the waste and backflow of grain to rural areas were very serious. In May, various places carried out rectification according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, strictly controlling the purchase of grain by households, and the sales volume in June has returned to normal, reduced by 17.5% compared to the month with the largest sales volume. Due to the complexity of the grain consumption quota issue, it is necessary to save strictly while considering nutrition. We are drafting a trial quota standard and inviting nutritionists to participate in the research.

The eating habits of the Chinese people are not consistent. Due to the instability of the yield of various grains, the grain controlled by the state is still difficult to achieve the appropriate proportion of varieties. Also, because the price difference of grain varieties is quite large, it can affect the burden of consumers, which increases the complexity of variety scheduling. In order to reduce the difficulty of scheduling work, avoid unnecessary transportation losses, and we have advocated "eating what you have," which is completely necessary. But some places emphasize "eating what you have" one-sidedly, forgetting to make the greatest effort to relatively meet the needs of the people on the other side, resulting in contradictions such as urban residents wanting to reduce the burden but not being able to buy coarse grain, and rural residents outside the city exchanging coarse grain for flour during festivals but not being able to exchange. There are also unreasonable situations such as issuing too much coarse grain in one period and too much fine grain in another period, and issuing a uniform amount of rice to households regardless of northern or southern origin. These shortcomings have been corrected as much as possible. But it must be said that the call for "eating what you have" is still necessary, and it is currently impossible to fully meet the people's requirements for variety selection.

We have done work on the supply of pig feed. In addition to the early instruction to collect and process factory waste to supply feed, many places also grind bran into mixed coarse bran to supply pig feed. At the same time, we have also supplied a large amount of coarse grain. We estimate that after the implementation of the "three-definite" policy, the pig feed problem can be relatively eased. In addition, in recent years, the agricultural department has repeatedly advocated using oil cakes as pig feed, producing manure from pigs to fertilize fields. Our country produces various oil cakes of more than 500 million jin every year. If we can widely promote and push for the part used as fertilizer to be gradually changed to feed under certain conditions, it will play a great role in solving the pig feed problem.

The price of unified purchase and sale of grain still has many unreasonable factors. First, the purchase and sale price difference is generally small after the abolition of seasonal price differences, and often the state has to lose money from purchasing to selling in the same place. Second, the urban-rural price difference is generally small, and in some grain-producing areas, the price is the same in urban and rural areas, and in some cases, the rural price is even higher than the urban price, resulting in a lot of loss. Third, there are many unreasonable phenomena in regional price differences, and the price difference from the production area to the sales area often does not cover the expenses. This unfavorable situation is partly due to the need to fight against private merchants in the early days of unified purchase and sale, and partly due to the one-sided group viewpoint among our cadres. We believe that it is necessary to gradually adjust it reasonably under the condition of not affecting the overall price level, to reduce the unnecessary losses of the state.

The institutionalization of unified purchase and sale of grain is the country's established policy. The experience accumulated in the past two years and the implementation of the "three-definite" policy have created conditions for establishing a system. We are drafting a series of methods under the leadership of the State Council, including the management methods of ledgers and certificates. The implementation of these methods will consolidate the political work results of the whole party in business work, which will be beneficial to the improvement of political work and the improvement of business work.

The planning of grain work is still not enough. The accuracy of national plans and provincial and municipal plans has been improved in the past three years, but the accuracy of plans in many grassroots units is still very poor, making the foundation of plans very weak. The implementation of the "three-definite" policy will give plans a more reliable foundation, thereby further improving accuracy.

Another manifestation of the lack of planning is the weak planning ideology. We lack a deep understanding of the high seriousness of planning, and the implementation of planning is not decisive. For example, the sales plan has been continuously exceeded in many places for a year, but it has not attracted serious attention and in-depth investigation, resulting in a situation of loose control before and tight control after unified sale, and the large consumption of inventory. This should be regarded as a serious lesson in the future.

The organizational structure and personnel establishment of the grain system still have chaotic phenomena, manifested in the unplanned establishment of purchase and sale points, administrative establishment not in line with the current work needs, enterprise establishment not implementing quota management, and confusion between administrative establishment and enterprise establishment. Therefore, in many places, when the administrative establishment is not enough, it is found in the enterprise establishment, and when the enterprise establishment is not enough, it is found in the temporary hired workers, forming too many organizational structures, too many people, and people floating above their positions; other local organs also take the opportunity to encroach on the establishment of the grain system. But at the same time, there are also situations where the organizational structure is not enough and the number of people is too few and weak in many places. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the business has changed too much in the past two years, and there are objective difficulties in determining the organization, verifying the establishment, and setting the quota, but the grain department has not formulated a simple and feasible preliminary control method, and has allowed it to run wild, which is primarily responsible.

Due to the excessive hiring of people in some places and the even more excessive hiring of temporary workers, many impure organizations have been found. Counter-revolutionaries will never relax their sabotage of grain work. They mainly carry out hidden sabotage of the unified purchase and sale of grain, sometimes also inciting the masses openly; the sabotage of grain warehouses, processing plants, and purchase and sale points is completely hidden. In the past half year, the number of fires and thefts in grain warehouses has increased, and the number of embezzlement cases has also increased, which must be seriously noted by all levels of leadership. In addition to continuously instructing various levels of grain departments to enhance vigilance and conduct key inspections, we urgently request that local party and government at all levels further strengthen the leadership of political work, personnel work, and security work in the grain department, and strengthen the rectification of mass warehouse protection organizations. We believe that as long as everyone is actively responsible and enhances vigilance, we can definitely make counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have no place to hide.

Grain work is closely related to the production and life of all people. If there are a few percent of errors and shortcomings, it can cause millions to tens of millions of people to suffer losses. The relationship between grain work and the masses is indeed too close. At the same time, grain work has many points and faces, and to correct the errors and shortcomings in the work, it can only rely on the supervision of the broad masses of the people. The inspection trip taken by the representatives this time, with grain work as the focus, is a good start. The problems and opinions reflected by the representatives will all be highly valued by us. We sincerely hope that this inspection can become a regular institution, and more hope that the inspection by the representatives will arouse the concern, support, and supervision of all the people for grain work, so that we can gradually overcome shortcomings and errors, and do a good job.

The task of grain work is very important, and it plays an important role in ensuring the completion of the Five-Year Plan. In the past three years, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the policy of grain work is completely correct. The shortcomings and errors in business operations, the progress of business work lagging behind the requirements of the objective situation, the grain department should first take responsibility. Due to the complex situation of grain in the country, we have gradually understood many things from not fully and deeply understanding them to relatively fully and deeply understanding them, and the leadership work can only gradually become clear and specific from unclear and non-specific. But new situations are constantly emerging, and new work tasks and new work methods and systems are constantly put before us; if we do not grasp them tightly, we will quickly become outsiders even if we are insiders. The instruction of Chairman Mao, "The important thing is to learn well," we should now understand it more deeply. "We are doing an extremely glorious and great business that our predecessors have never done." We must rely closely on the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the people, work diligently and conscientiously, study hard, and work hard to resolutely complete the glorious and great tasks assigned to us by the Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Liao Ruyuan**

**For the Development of Agricultural Production and the Implementation of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture**

I fully agree with the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China," and I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on agricultural production, the cooperative movement, and rural conditions.

1. The production targets for grain, cotton, hemp, tobacco, silk, tea, fruit, sugar crops, and oil crops, as well as livestock and aquatic products, as stipulated in the draft of the Five-Year Plan, are relatively reliable and can be completed and even exceeded. These targets should be guaranteed to be completed and efforts should be made to exceed them. At the same time, these production targets are also active, not conservative. To complete these targets, we still need to make great efforts. Due to the fact that the first two years of the Five-Year Plan both encountered serious natural disasters, the agricultural production plan was not completed, and the tasks for the next three years have increased. Especially this year, the plan stipulates: the grain production should increase by 20 billion jin compared to 1954, cotton should increase by more than 40 million dan, sugarcane should increase by 16%, flue-cured tobacco should increase by 38%, etc. The task is arduous. Ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's plan is of great significance to whether the first five-year agricultural development plan can be completed. If this year's agricultural production targets cannot be realized, it will increase the difficulties for next year and the year after, and it will bring the danger of not being able to complete the first five-year agricultural development plan. Therefore, it is said that this year is a crucial year for completing the first five-year plan.

From this year's sowing situation, the grain has basically completed the sowing plan, cotton has slightly exceeded it, and the sowing area of tobacco, hemp, and sugar crops has not completed the original plan, but it has increased compared to last year. Except for a few places where the range of water and drought disasters is not large, the spring seedlings are generally growing well. The current task is to strengthen field management, weed, fertilize, strengthen the fight against natural disasters, improve the yield per unit area, and strive for high yield and stable harvest. The reasons why tobacco, hemp, and sugar crops have not completed the sowing plan are mainly due to the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture and some local agricultural departments have not paid enough attention, some farmers have the psychology of wanting to plant more grain; our political work and economic work have not been done well; and the purchase price of some technical crops is still not completely reasonable, which also affects the enthusiasm of farmers to plant technical crops.

The main increase in grain and cotton is correct; at the same time, we must also increase various technical crops according to the national plan, breed livestock, and increase livestock products and aquatic products. Otherwise, it will not meet the needs of industrial development and the growing needs of people's lives. In the discussion of the draft of the Five-Year Plan, many representatives have put forward many active and specific opinions on how to ensure agricultural increase in production and how to increase livestock products and aquatic products. This fully shows that everyone understands the extreme importance of agriculture to the development of industry—the condition provided by agriculture for the development of industry. The task of agricultural workers and all farmers is: to fully and over-fulfill this year's and the entire five-year agricultural increase in production plan, and to strive for the realization of the first five-year plan to advance to socialism.

2. Is the ratio of investment in industry and agriculture in the draft of the Five-Year Plan appropriate? Can we reduce industrial investment to increase agricultural investment?

We believe that the ratio of investment in industry and agriculture is appropriate and is based on the country's overall tasks in the transitional period, and it is also in line with the specific conditions of China's current agricultural production.

What are the specific conditions of China's current agricultural production?

Due to the fact that China is still a country with backward industry and cannot manufacture agricultural machinery by itself, and the amount of petroleum extracted is still small, it is still not possible to widely implement agricultural mechanization. At the same time, due to the limitations of industry and technology, there is a lack of technical data, and large-scale water conservancy construction cannot be fully carried out. Some large water conservancy projects that should be built often cannot be built due to insufficient technical data, and cannot start work for the time being. Under such conditions, the way to develop agricultural production is mainly to rely on mutual aid and cooperation, rationally use labor, fully utilize land, improve cultivation technology, strengthen disaster resistance, and give full play to the superiority of collective production to increase agricultural production; in terms of equipment, it is still animal power and new animal-powered farm tools; in terms of water conservancy, it is mainly small and medium-sized agricultural water conservancy such as well digging, pond building, and new water wheels and water pumps; in terms of expanding cultivated land area, in addition to local farmers opening up small patches of wasteland and establishing a small number of state-owned farms and trial mechanized land reclamation, it is also due to the limitation of agricultural machinery and petroleum, and large-scale migration and land reclamation cannot be carried out for the time being. Of course, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations need the state's loan assistance, but loans should not be too much. Past experience has proven that too many loans will inevitably encourage the waste of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, increase their difficulty in repaying loans, affect their distribution of production income, and may even drive them away from the masses. The promotion of new farm tools and the construction of agricultural water conservancy require state investment and loans, but it is more important to do a good job in mass work and mobilize the manpower and financial resources of the broad masses of farmers. It is not possible to solve the problem by relying solely on the state's money. From this, it can be seen that whether agricultural production can be increased and how much it can be increased is not simply decided by the state's agricultural investment. At a time when China's industry is not yet developed and cannot be re-equipped with modern technology for agriculture, it is not beneficial to increase agricultural investment inappropriately.

The investment target for developing agricultural production in the Five-Year Plan is determined based on the current specific situation of agriculture. The total expenditure for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy over five years is 6.1 billion yuan, excluding non-agricultural basic construction investment, there are still 5.52 billion yuan, plus military reclamation fees, rural disaster relief fees, and agricultural loans, the total expenditure of the state for developing agricultural production over five years is 8.4 billion yuan. Plus the investment of about 1 billion yuan by farmers themselves for expanded reproduction, the total is about 18.4 billion yuan, with an average investment of more than 10 yuan per mu. This number is not small and is in line with the needs of the current conditions of agricultural production.

At the same time, it should be seen that part of the industrial expenditure, such as the investment in the construction of tractor factories, farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories, although listed in the industrial investment items, is actually completely used for the development of agricultural production. And these factories can only develop under the premise of the development of steel and other basic industries, so part of the investment in these basic industries is actually for the development of agricultural production. These heavy industry construction investments, although they cannot immediately bring about an increase in current agricultural production, are creating conditions for the further and larger-scale development of agricultural production. Not only the part of heavy industry that produces production materials is for the development of agricultural production, but also the light industry that produces consumer goods mainly serves the farmers, because farmers account for the majority of the population, especially after the land reform, they need a large supply of industrial products; and the vast handicraft industry plays an important role in meeting the needs of farm tools and daily necessities for farmers, and the vast majority of handicraft industries serve agricultural production and the lives of farmers. In people's economic life and the development of social production, agriculture cannot be separated from industry. The view that opposes agriculture and industry and completely isolates agricultural investment from the entire economic construction investment is obviously incorrect.

Fundamentally speaking, industry is the foundation for the high development of agriculture. The fundamental reason for China's agricultural backwardness lies in the fact that it cannot manufacture agricultural machinery, and small peasant economy still occupies a dominant position in agriculture. Because it cannot manufacture agricultural machinery, it cannot use modern technology to equip agriculture, and it cannot greatly improve agricultural productivity; because small-scale farmers cultivate small plots of land, they also cannot use agricultural machinery and modern technology, and they cannot greatly develop agricultural production. Therefore, the fundamental way to change China's agricultural backwardness is to implement socialist industrialization and implement the socialist transformation of the small peasant economy. Tractors, water pumps, chemical fertilizers, etc., are all supplied by industry. Only on the basis of industrialization can the productivity of agriculture be greatly improved. If we reduce industrial investment and increase agricultural investment, the result will be to delay socialist industrialization. If industrialization is delayed, can we completely rely on the method of importing agricultural machinery to open up tens of millions of mu of wasteland and to mechanize the tens of millions of mu of land in our country? Can we meet the demand for fertilization with imported chemical fertilizers? This is obviously unimaginable. Therefore, the method of reducing industrial investment and increasing agricultural investment is to continue the backward state of China's agricultural equipment, which is putting the cart before the horse for the development of agricultural production. Delaying socialist industrialization is against the greatest interests of farmers, against the greatest interests of all the people, and against the general line. Therefore, we cannot adopt the method of reducing industrial investment to increase agricultural investment. We believe that the ratio of investment in industry and agriculture in the Five-Year Plan is appropriate.

Of course, this does not mean that we do not strive to increase agricultural investment within the possible range. On the contrary, recently, due to the resolute implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on increasing production and opposing waste, a large amount of funds have been saved, thereby increasing 500 million yuan (and it may be more) of investment in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, mainly used for land reclamation, migration, and water conservancy construction; and in agricultural loans, it has been decided to increase the poor farmers' cooperative fund loan by 200 million yuan, and another loan for the basic construction of agricultural producers' cooperatives will be increased. This is not reducing industrial investment to increase agricultural investment, but using part of the saved funds to increase investment in industrial construction and also increase investment in agricultural construction.

Increasing production, opposing waste, and using all the funds that can be saved from all aspects to develop production is precisely the fundamental principle of socialist accumulation. From this aspect, the phenomenon of waste in the agricultural department and its subordinate state-owned agricultural, pastoral, and fishery enterprises and institutions is very serious, which is not in line with the requirements of socialist fund accumulation, and the leadership work of the Ministry of Agriculture has shortcomings, which must be checked and corrected.

3. Is the agricultural cooperative movement not going well and harming farmers' enthusiasm for production?

We believe it is not the case. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report has made an appropriate assessment of the agricultural cooperative movement. In recent years, the achievements of the agricultural cooperative movement are great, and under the condition of heavy tasks in rural areas, the establishment of cooperatives has been completed as planned every year, and even exceeded the plan. By the spring of this year, there are already more than 670,000 cooperatives nationwide. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives has become the actual action of the broad masses of farmers. These agricultural producers' cooperatives have more than 90% that are consolidated. From the perspective of production, more than 80% of the more than 100,000 old cooperatives established before the spring of last year increased production; among the more than 500,000 new cooperatives, those with increased production and good spring seedling growth also account for the vast majority. The superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives in increasing production has been more widely demonstrated among the masses. The recent results of the rectification of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places show that the number of cooperatives reduced is less than 5%, and the remaining agricultural producers' cooperatives are about 650,000, with more than 15 million households joining the cooperatives, accounting for about 14% of the total number of households in the country. This fully proves that in the large-scale development of agricultural producers' cooperatives last winter and this spring, it was generally healthy and normal, and only a few counties and some villages in a few counties developed too hastily and had more problems. Some provinces and counties, although the proportion of households joining the cooperatives is large and the number of cooperatives is large, such as Shanxi Province, where the proportion of households joining the cooperatives has reached 40% of the total number of households in the province, and Juxian County, where there are already 1,230 cooperatives; but there are not many problems, and the number of cooperatives that cannot be consolidated is very small, which also proves that the development is normal.

Due to the large-scale development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, it has also promoted the great development of mutual aid teams, and the number of households participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide accounts for about two-thirds of the total number of households in the country. Poor peasants and new middle peasants who have risen from poor and hired peasants generally actively support cooperation and want to establish cooperatives; part of the old middle peasants are still hesitant and observing, while another part has been attracted to the cooperative movement. Mutual aid and cooperation to advance to socialism have become the main trend in rural areas, and the existing large number of agricultural producers' cooperatives are a powerful position to lead the broad masses of farmers to continue to advance to socialism.

Of course, in the victorious advance of the agricultural cooperative movement, there are no shortcomings. In some places, there have been errors such as coercion and command, violating the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, or there are still shortcomings such as poor management and poor production organization. We believe that these are local shortcomings and errors that occur in the victorious advance of the movement, which are difficult to completely avoid. We do not hide these shortcomings and errors, but openly criticize them, aiming to correct errors and improve shortcomings, and advance more healthily and confidently.

It must be understood that the transition to socialism through mutual aid and cooperation is not only the fundamental interest of poor peasants but also the fundamental interest of middle peasants; not only poor peasants actively support socialism, but middle peasants are also laboring people and can advance to socialism under the leadership of the working class. Because small-scale peasant farmers can only get rid of poverty forever and become prosperous together by organizing, mutual aid, and cooperation, and advancing to socialism. Especially for the farmers of our country, due to the large population and insufficient land, in addition to organizing and cooperating, rationally using labor, fully utilizing land, developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, and engaging in organized land reclamation and migration to expand the cultivated land area, what other way is there?

We must actively consolidate the agricultural producers' cooperatives that have been established and actively develop new cooperatives. In areas liberated later, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives is small and must be actively developed. In old liberated areas where the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives is not large, it should also be actively developed, and more so in blank villages; in areas where the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives is not small but the movement is healthy and normal, it should continue to be developed and should not stagnate; as for a few places where the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives is large but the quality is poor and there are many problems, it is necessary to do a good job of consolidating the existing cooperatives and develop on the basis of consolidation. In the next two to three years, it is a critical period for the agricultural cooperative movement, and a solid foundation must be laid for the cooperative movement during this period.

4. Regarding the issue of farmers' lives, Vice Premier Chen Yun has made a brief analysis in his speech on the grain issue on the 21st. Now, based on a large amount of specific data, I will make some supplementary explanations.

Due to the completion of land reform and the subsequent development of mutual aid and cooperation, the class situation in rural areas has fundamentally changed, and farmers' lives have improved significantly. Except for about 10% of the original landlords and rich peasants in the rural population, in the past: middle peasants accounted for 20% to 30% of the rural population, and poor peasants and hired peasants accounted for 60% to 70%; in some areas where land was relatively scattered, middle peasants accounted for 30% to 40%, and poor peasants and hired peasants accounted for 50% to 60%. Now, in old liberated areas, poor peasants account for only 10% to 20%, and new and old middle peasants account for 70% to 80%; in late liberated areas, new and old middle peasants account for 60%, and poor peasants account for 30%. This means that in old liberated areas, more than three-quarters to more than four-fifths of the original poor peasants have risen to become new middle peasants; in late liberated areas, more than half of the original poor peasants have also risen to become new middle peasants. Moreover, the economic status of the current poor peasants is also very different from that of the past poor peasants. The current poor peasants all have their own share of land, and although the production materials such as livestock and farm tools are not complete, they also have a considerable part, and their clothing, food, and cultural and health lives have improved a lot. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that farmers' lives have improved universally in recent years.

On the other hand, by adding up a few big accounts, it can also be clearly seen that farmers' lives have improved universally. First, in addition to dividing about 700 million mu of land, farmers also divided a large amount of livestock, farm tools, grain, houses, and other economic fruits in the land reform, which everyone knows and does not need to be explained in detail. Second, agricultural production has been increasing year by year. If we take the total production value of agriculture and rural sideline products in 1949 as 100, it increased to 148.5 in 1952, and it increased again in 1953 and 1954 compared to 1952. According to the agricultural and rural sideline production total value of 483.9 billion yuan in 1952, excluding the non-agricultural population in rural areas and averaging per household, each household's income is about 450 yuan, while in 1949, the average income per household was still less than 300 yuan. Third, before liberation and before land reform, farmers had to pay about 70 billion jin of grain rent every year, and they also had to pay various unclear surcharges and miscellaneous taxes, which have all been abolished now, and farmers' production income is all their own; the public grain burden is also relatively light, and according to the calculation in 1952, the total public grain still does not account for 13% of the total grain production that year, and it is less than 7% of the total production value of agriculture and rural sideline products that year in terms of currency. Since 1952, production has been increasing year by year, while the burden has remained roughly at the level of 1952. Fourth, due to the stabilization of prices and the development of state-owned commerce and rural supply and marketing cooperatives, the intermediate exploitation of private merchants on farmers has been greatly reduced. Just from the cancellation of the seasonal price difference of grain alone, the farmers, economic crop area farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, salt workers, etc. in shortage areas can obtain at least 20 billion jin of grain benefits every year. Fifth, the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain is to guarantee the grain supply of urban and rural people across the country, and it is not to lower the grain consumption level of farmers. According to the calculation in 1954, the total grain production for the year was 339 billion jin of raw grain. After deducting the total amount of public grain and purchased grain, the actual commercial grain was 533 billion jin, equivalent to 620 billion jin of raw grain; after purchasing grain and returning some grain to rural areas, the total amount of grain left in the hands of farmers, plus the grain returned to rural areas, was 2,770 billion jin of raw grain. The total rural population is less than 500 million, with an average of 560 jin of raw grain per person, of which the tuber is still calculated as 4 jin for 1 jin. According to the current grain consumption level in rural areas, this amount is enough. Could the poor peasants and general middle peasants in the old society have so much grain per person per year, including adults and children? Obviously not. Sixth, farmers' purchasing power has also been increasing year by year. In 1952, the expenditure of rural residents on purchasing various commodities was approximately 15.42 billion yuan, with an average of 31.1 yuan per person; in 1953, it was 18.97 billion yuan, with an average of 37.5 yuan per person; in 1954, it was 22.2 billion yuan, with an average of 42.8 yuan per person. The above big accounts fully prove that farmers' lives have improved year by year.

Of course, the current living standards of farmers and the living standards of the entire Chinese people are still not high, although they have improved a lot compared to before liberation, but they are still far behind the living standards of the socialist people of the Soviet Union, and the material and cultural living standards of the Chinese people are still low. The purpose of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese revolution is precisely to continuously and universally improve the living standards of the entire Chinese people.

For farmers, when farmers did not have land and were oppressed by the feudal exploitation of the landlord class, suffering from hunger and cold, the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led farmers to fight for the elimination of the landlord class and the acquisition of land. When the landlord class had been eliminated and farmers had obtained land, the Communist Party of China, the people's government, and Chairman Mao vigorously assisted farmers in developing agricultural production and actively led farmers to advance to socialism, avoiding capitalist exploitation. Because only socialism is the road to happiness for farmers. Building socialism is in the best interests of all the people and is also in the best interests of farmers. For a more beautiful and happy future, farmers must struggle with the entire Chinese people to build socialism.

At a time when the entire Chinese people are building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, especially in the recent period since this spring, some wrong views have appeared on rural issues. Some people think that the agricultural cooperative movement is not going well, the grain work is not going well, and it has harmed farmers' enthusiasm for production. Some people even repeat the fallacy of "farmers living in the ninth layer of the earth." This is obviously not in line with the facts and is completely wrong. Those who hold these views are mostly due to their one-sidedness in looking at problems, seeing only the trees and not the forest, looking only at the local shortcomings and errors in the work, and lacking a comparative analysis of the scope and degree of shortcomings and errors, and underestimating the great achievements of the agricultural socialist transformation movement; but their starting point is good, they want to do things well. We should listen to their opinions and accept their correct criticisms, and at the same time explain the situation, help them understand the problem, and work together to improve the work. There are also a very small number of elements who, from their original landlord and bourgeois class positions, observe problems, do not see the achievements, do not hear the achievements, and are delighted with the shortcomings and errors; some even deliberately distort the facts, use them as an excuse to attack, and resist socialism; among them, there are also some counter-revolutionaries who spread rumors and incite, and secretly plot to sabotage. The Chinese people must refute the clamor of landlord class elements and some bourgeois class elements, be vigilant, and stop the conspiratorial activities of counter-revolutionaries. The attempt of landlord class elements and some bourgeois class elements to make farmers leave the socialist road and lead farmers to the capitalist road will definitely be abandoned by farmers, just as they have tried to maintain feudal power and obstruct farmers' land reform in the past. Because all conscious farmers know that the capitalist road is a road of poverty and bankruptcy for the vast majority of farmers.

The 600 million Chinese people will create their own socialist happy life with their own hands, which is an irresistible force for any force to stop. The Chinese people will definitely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, firmly advance to the victory of socialism with unshakable determination, full of confidence.

**Speech by Xu Dehang**

I fully support the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China" and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I also propose that the conference approve and adopt these documents.

Comrades, the proposal of the first Five-Year Plan is an unprecedented great event in Chinese history. As Chairman Mao said, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great business that our predecessors have never done." Our China is a country with a long history and a great power, but in the past hundred years, we have fallen behind. We have been in a state of poverty and backwardness for a considerable period of time, forced to stop. Backwardness means being beaten. In the past hundred years, we have indeed been beaten. We have been beaten by imperialism, beaten by feudal warlords. These facts of bloodshed are something that I believe we will never forget. Thinking of the past and looking at the future of national construction revealed by the Five-Year Plan, we will go from a backward agricultural country to a prosperous socialist industrial country. I believe every patriotic person is as excited and inspired as I am! The great plan to control the Yellow River, which is a victory over nature, will bring endless benefits to the people, a plan that can only be carried out by the people in power. Here, I express my deep gratitude to the Communist Party of China and our beloved Chairman Mao with a heart full of excitement.

Comrades, the implementation of the Five-Year Plan is not an easy task. Its implementation process will inevitably be a process of tenacious labor, strict frugality, and sharp class struggle. Many experiences have proven that our victory is the enemy's defeat. What we like the most is what the enemy hates the most. The Kuomintang reactionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionaries will definitely use all kinds of despicable and shameless means to sabotage us; the recent exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident and various counter-revolutionary cases in different places fully prove that the class enemy has not been asleep, and they are becoming more and more rampant. I fully support the correct measure of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to approve the arrest and trial of the extremely vicious counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannan and Hu Feng, and I request a thorough investigation of Pan Hannan and Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes and severe punishment. I also believe that the exposure of the Pan Hannan incident is a major victory for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people in their struggle against counter-revolutionaries. This victory shows that the Communist Party of China is wise and great. Only such a party armed with Marxism-Leninism can always maintain the purity of its ranks and lead us to carry out the Chinese revolution. All Chinese people must unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, resolutely fight against all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and dedicate all their strength to the cause of socialist construction.

Secondly, to achieve the victory of the Five-Year Plan, we must fully launch the movement to increase production and oppose waste, and resolutely fight against all corrupt and wasteful behaviors. We know that corruption and waste are as much our most fearsome enemies as they are to national construction. The shocking facts of waste mentioned by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian in their reports are truly heart-wrenching! Comrades, 7.664 billion yuan of national construction funds is something we have collected ourselves, and it is truly hard to come by. The Chinese people absolutely cannot allow a large amount of funds to be used on non-productive and unnecessary expenses, absolutely cannot allow schools, office buildings, and staff dormitories to be built like palaces and temples; and absolutely cannot allow some organs or enterprises to use a large amount of funds on unnecessary luxurious and extravagant equipment. As for the loss caused by embezzlement and theft to state property, it is also shocking. All of these are criminal acts in our country and must be severely punished.

Finally, it should be pointed out that to achieve the victory of the Five-Year Plan, a large number of talents who are loyal to the motherland and to socialist construction in various fields are needed. National cultural, educational, and scientific workers, in order to undertake the glorious tasks assigned to the country by the Five-Year Plan, must further carry out ideological reform work and improve their political and ideological level. Chairman Mao as early as 1951 taught us: "Ideological reform, first of all, the ideological reform of various intellectuals, is an important condition for thorough democratic reform and gradual industrialization in various aspects of our country." It should be pointed out that the achievements we have made in ideological reform work in recent years are great. But currently, among our intellectuals, there still exists a certain degree of individualism, liberalism, subjectivism, and other bourgeois ideas and styles. If these ideas and styles are not eliminated, they will not only be unable to play the role they should play in national construction, but may also be used by counter-revolutionaries and even degenerate and change quality. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated our "liver" to "win people over" and "connect with people." We must learn from the serious lessons of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, grasp the ideological weapon of dialectical materialism, and continue to resolutely fight against bourgeois idealism. Any idea that Marxism-Leninism is unrelated to one's own scholarship, or only focuses on business and neglects politics, is wrong and harmful, and should be corrected.

Comrades, the Five-Year Plan is the battle program for the entire Chinese people to implement socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. After it is decided by this conference, it will have the binding force of law for every Chinese person. This plan has been implemented for more than two years since 1953, achieving significant results. In the face of this great plan that relates to the fate of the country and the happiness of our descendants for thousands of generations, we must all exert our greatest efforts to ensure its victory and over-fulfillment. We must cherish state property as if it were our own lives. We must always maintain high vigilance and resolutely fight against counter-revolutionaries, we must be honest and diligent, do a good job at our posts, and strive for the complete fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    刘仙洲代表的发言
    我对于李富春副总理，李先念副总理，彭德怀副总理，邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长分别作的五个报告，都完全赞同，并衷心地拥护！
    现在我仅就着第一个五年计划说几句话。
    经过详细地学习了第一个五年计划草案以后，我觉着它每章每节的规划和指标都是经过调查研究或是根据过去实践的经验制定的。因之各项数字都具有很高的可靠性和积极性。所提各项原则和应该注意的问题，对于我们今后各方面的工作也都有很高的指导作用。
    我愿意就着个人在教育工作者和科学工作者的立场提出三个问题来，证实我的看法：
    第一，培养干部今后应重视质量问题
    我们想着逐步地把我们祖国建设成为高度工业化的社会主义国家，一定需要继续培养很大数量的建设干部。但是如果培养的干部有一部分质量太差，特别是政治质量太差，就不能适应国家的要求。
    在过去几年以来，全国高等学校的招收新生，失之过于追求数量，忽视质量。有的因为科学基础太差或健康情况太差，沿途掉队；有的思想极端落后，甚至反动，经各方面的帮助和教育，仍毫无效果。这一部分质量太差的学生实在是无法培养成为社会主义建设者，只占了名额并浪费国家的资金。
    我们常想：如果把一个高等工业学校比做一个制造工程师的工厂，那末，教学设备就是生产工具；教师就是技术工人；招收的新生就是原料；毕业生就是产品。打算使产品的质量提高，不但生产工具的质量和工人的技术要好，入厂的原料也必须合乎一定的规格，否则产生次品甚至产生废品，恐怕是必然的。
    在李富春副总理的报告里边，对于今后各高等学校培养干部提出下列的原则：“在高等学校中培养建设干部，今后应该着重提高质量，同时兼顾数量”；他又提出：“今后必须努力地注意学生质量的问题，在保证质量的条件下适当地增加数量，使培养出来的技术干部在政治上是可靠的，在业务上能够相当掌握现代科学技术知识，同时身体是健康的”。这是国家对于我们各高等学校产品的质量和数量提出来的新要求，我认为这是非常正确非常切合实际的。
      在李富春副总理的报告里边又提出：“高等学校招收的新生，最低限度的条件，应当是政治上可靠，身体能够坚持学习，学业上能够跟得上班。”这是国家对于我们各高等学校进厂原料的规格提出来的保证。当然也是非常要紧的。在我们从事高等教育工作的同人们看来，不但能使我们比较容易完成任务，还会给我们减轻不少的困难。我们是太拥护了。希望高等教育部主持统一招生的时候，能够严肃地认真地贯彻这一原则。同时我们也应该本着毛主席“三好”的号召，注重全面发展的教育，使将来少出次品和废品，也少浪费国家不少的资金。
    第二，学校中加强政治思想工作领导问题
    在计划草案里边提出的关于完成发展高等教育的任务应该注意的问题中的第六项：“……加强政治思想工作的领导，加强教员、职员、学员对马克思列宁主义和国家政策的学习”。这也是一项极正确极重要的措施，本来没有再解释的必要。但是因为我们知道，社会上还有一些人，甚至有一些从事教育工作的人，他们对于在学校中的政治思想工作似乎还是重视得不够，前几天听到说，竟有人对于这一项表示怀疑，所以也愿重复说它一下。
      我们打算进行任何工作的时候，一定先要明确这一项工作的目标。因为一切工作计划都是根据着工作目标来制定的。例如，高等工业学校的工作目标，在计划草案里边和报告里边都明确规定为：“培养大量的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的工程技术人员”。我们的培养目标既是这样的明确，那末第六项的措施就是十分必要的。高等工业学校的毕业生将来都是社会主义工业单位的工程师或生产指挥员，他们有必要先具有社会主义的道德品质。又就我个人参加学校行政工作的经验看，无论是教师们的教学工作，职员们的行政工作，如果在政治思想工作方面领导得好，使他们大多数都有了社会主义觉悟和主人翁的态度，则一切都容易提高。否则费力多而收效少。所以我认
  为在计划草案里边提出在学校工作中，加强政治思想工作的领导，加强教职员和学生对马克思列宁主义和国家政策的学习是最重要的一项。不但不应该有丝毫的怀疑，相反，一定要对它有充分的重视。
        第三，科学研究问题
    在计划草案第八章里边，有：“关于科学研究 工作”一节。在组织方面，提出中国科学院，各业务部门和各高等学校应有相当的配合；在研究对象方面，也提出大致的分工原则。最后并提出：“所有科学研究机关都应该加强对国家建设中有关的实际问题的研究”这一个总的原则，更是十分正确和必要的。
      任何一种事业，例如任何一种工业企业，都需要有科学研究工作在前边领导着，它才能够逐步前进。否则几年以后，甚至一年半年以后，技术上就有落后的可能。在我们的工业建设中，由苏联帮助我们建设的一百五十六个大单位，不但是采用苏联最先进的装备，并由苏联专家从头到尾的帮助我们建立，一直到开工。我们不但应该学会怎样继续工作下去，同时也必须学会怎样的继续向前进步。因为朋友只可以帮助我们建立和开始工作，不能永久代替我们工作。打算得到能继续向前进步的结果，就必须各附以相当的科学研究机构加以领导。计划草案上规定：“除中国科学院外，各业务部门都应该设置一定的科学研究机构”，是很正确的。
    随着国家经济建设的开展，中国科学院，各业务部门和各高等学校的科学研究工作，将有逐步的开展是必然的，也是应该的。但是若任其自流，不加强其组织性和计划性，则容易发生甚至可以说已经发生一种流弊，就是：有的研究工作，各单位陷于不必要的重复，在人力物力方面，造成一定的浪费；另一方面，有一些很重要国家也很需要的研究工作，因进行比较困难之故，却无人开始。这两方面都给国家带来一定的损失。
    在计划草案里边，“关于科学研究工作”的最后一句说：“中国科学院所属研究单位、各业务部门所属研究单位和各高等学校的科学研究计划，应该逐步地由国家计划委员会汇总平衡”，就是针对着这一点说的，所以也是极端重要的。
    我们知道，建设社会主义社会的一切工作都应该是有组织有计划地进行。希望国家计划委员会本着既定的原则，协同中国科学院、高等教育部等有关单位，组成一个全面的领导机构，更主动的在这方面加强起来，使全国各方面的科学研究工作也具有统一的高度的组织性与计划性，从而使我国的科学技术水平逐步地提高，并使不再发生不必要的重复和不应有的脱节现象，那就更好了。
    总起来说，我对于这第一个五年计划草案是衷心拥护的，认为它是完全切合实际并具有很高的指导作用。它一定能使祖国向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会推进一大步。我建议我们大会予以一致的通过，并希望我们全体代表和全国人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，以最大的努力为它的胜利完成而奋斗！
    贾拓夫主任的发言
    我完全拥护发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划草案。并完全同意李富春副总理关于这个草案的报告，以及李先念副总理关于财政预算和决算的报告，彭德怀副总理关于兵役法草案的报告，邓子恢副总理关于治理黄河规划的报告，彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告。
    在五年计划草案中规定的轻工业的各项计划指标和措施，我认为都是适当的、正确的。这已经在过去的两个年度计划的顺利完成和超额完成中得到证明。包括今年在内的后三年的计划指标，我相信，经过努力，也一定能够完成并超额完成的。
    轻工业生产的绝大部分产品是为了满足人民各种生活需要。全国轻工业产品的总产值，在过去三年恢复和两年建设期间，已经增加了两倍。若干产品的产量，如布匹、纸张，增加了三倍左右，面粉、糖增加了两倍左右，卷烟和火柴各增加了一倍多和半倍多。社会主义成份的工业在全国轻工业中的比重，也由四分之一上升到二分之一左右。这样就使我们能够在基本上保证了历年市场供应和社会需要，从而也保证了人民生活水平的一定程度的提高，并成为国家积累建设资金的重要源泉。
      但是，人民对轻工业产品需要的增长，特别在衣、食两方面，很快地超过了轻工业生产增长的速度，如棉布、麻袋、植物油、糖、卷烟、皮革等，
  均出现了不同程度的供不应求的情况。虽然有某些日用品和药品，由于质量不好，品种规格不合社会需要和某些盲目发展，发生了一些产品积压的现象，但这是暂时性和局部性的，从总的方面观察，前述那种轻工业产品供不应求的情况，仍然是当前和今后轻工业生产中的基本趋势。不难理解，这种趋势，正是反映出我国国家社会制度的优越性，
  反映出我国工农业生产的不断发展和人民购买力的不断提高。并将不断地推动我国国民经济的高涨。
    五年计划草案规定消费资料生产每年平均递增
  百分之十二·四，这个速度是适当的。有人在问，既然人民需要增长速度很快，市场供应不足，既然轻工业是投资少、收效快、又能大量积累资金，为什么不把轻工业生产计划指标再提高些呢？大家知
  道，我们国家为了全面发展国民经济，保证国防，必须优先发展重工业，轻工业应该也只能是相应的发展。而决定轻工业生产发展的速度，也不仅要从社会需要出发，而且要看生产能力是否可能？原料 供应有无保证？三者不可缺一。现在我国轻工业的
  生产能力，虽然设备有些陈旧，技术也较落后，但潜力却是很大，有许多至今尚未充分利用，以一九五四年的设备利用率来说：全国卷烟、火柴不及三分之一，油脂、面粉仅为一半上下，皮革也不过百分之六十左右，纺织以国营来说，虽达到百分之九
  十六，但由于去年的棉花收成不好，一九五五年将下降为百分之七十六了。由此可见，目前许多轻工业生产之所以不能更快更大地增长，既不是没有生产能力，也不是社会不需要，主要是由于原料供应不足。这就是当前轻工业生产发展中所遇到的一个困难问题。
    轻工业生产的原料，大部分是取给于农业，所以，农业发展的快慢，在很大程度上决定着轻工业，特别是纺织、食品工业生产发展的速度。如果说，一九五三年消费资料的生产能够有较大的发展
  （比一九五二年增长百分之二十八），其主要原因之一就是由于一九五二年的农业丰收，那末，一九五四年的严重水灾，就不能不使一九五五年纺织和食品工业的原料供应受到很大影响，从而使一九五五年的棉纱将比一九五四年少产六十万件以上，麻袋少产一千八百余万条，卷烟少产十八万箱，榨油也将比原计划少产十八万吨。这样，也就不可避免地要使许多工厂暂时开工不足，国家和工人的收入都要减少一些，市场供应多少也要感到一些紧张。
    由此可见，要使轻工业生产的发展能够逐步赶上人民生活和国家建设的需要，就必须首先解决原料不足的问题。大家知道，农业生产虽然逐年都有发展，经济作物也逐年都有增长，但要大规模发展，是不可能在短时期内实现的。这是和发展国家的重工业和对农业实行社会主义改造分不开的。如果没有重工业的发展，就不可能给农业大量供应化学肥料、农业机械、拖拉机、汽油、柴油、水利设备等，就不可能根本改变农业面貌，因而也就不可能解决轻工业发展中的原料不足问题；同时也就不可能供给轻工业化学品、金属品等原材料和生产设备。因此，没有重工业的发展，也不可能有轻工业的发展。在重工业未发展前，轻易允诺大量增产布匹、食品等是不切合实际的，不能兑现的。
    但这并不是说：现在我们要增加轻工业的生产，就只能坐待重工业和农业生产的大量发展，除此而外，再没有任何别的办法了。不是的。如果我们能够挖掘潜力、增产节约，积极扩大原料资源，寻找各种代用品，实行各种废料回收使用；克服原料使用中的各种浪费和不合理的现象，在保证质量的条件下节约用料，提高出品率；降低废品、次品率，提高产品的质量，减少某些积压产品而改产社会所需要的新种类产品；那末，原料困难还是可以缩小的，生产自然也就可以相应增加。
    应当指出，所有轻工业生产企业都存在着增产节约的巨大潜力。各轻工业部门及其所属企业在增产节约方面，也都做了一些努力，一九五四年轻工业方面四十几种主要产品所以能完成或超额完成国家计划，就是和推行各种增产节约的有效措施分不开的。例如纺织工业部一九五四年平均每件棉纱用棉量达到三八八点七斤，比一九五三年平均每件纱节约用棉一点八四斤。轻工业部一九五五年在国家计划降低成本指标百分之六点五的基础上，又确定再降低百分之一点六四，这就证明轻工业各生产企业在节约方面是存在着巨大潜力的。可是不能否认，正像有些代表所批评的那样，我们在原料使用中还存在着相当严重的浪费现象，并且还有许多可资利用的资源没有充分地合理地利用起来。
    在纺织工业中，浪费棉花和棉纱的现象，相当普遍。有些国营棉纺织厂的细纱车间，每纺一件纱要出三斤油花。拿全国统扯用棉量来比较，一九五四年天津纺管局每件纱用三九○斤多一点，而其他许多地区都要用三九四斤以上。有一个厂在去年五月份一个月，自己厂里织布用的纱就超过定额二千六百多斤。在榨油工业中，全国先进企业和落后企业之间的出油率最大的差额：花生百分之十二，芝麻百分之十一，菜籽百分之十六，棉籽百分之十一点二，大豆百分之六点五。在造纸工业中，同样一吨新闻纸的用浆量，先进的和落后的相差一百八十斤左右，一吨漂白苇浆的用苇量，相差四百斤左右。在食品工业中，同样一箱卷烟的用烟量，先进的和落后的相差十斤左右。同样一百斤酒所用的粮食，相差五十斤以上。在橡胶工业中，同一型号的每条汽车轮胎的生胶耗用量，先进的和落后的相差四斤以上。这些浪费现象，在全国范围并不是个别的，而是在不同程度上大量的和普遍存在的。假如我们采取厉行节约克服浪费的有效措施，使先进企业在巩固成绩的基础上，继续改进，同时，把落后企业的技术水平和管理水平提高到或接近于先进企业的程度，那末，这就会给国家节约很多原材料，从而增加很多产量。
    半年来，轻工业各部通过召开各种专业会议，初步提出若干增产节约的指标：在纺织工业方面，
  一九五五年要求全国平均生产每件棉纱的用棉量，在保证质量的基础上，由一九五四年的三百九十三斤降低三斤到五斤，这是可以做到也必须做到的。山东施惠心的轧棉配车法，要是在全国推广开来，至少可增产皮棉百分之一。轧花厂和棉籽榨油厂增加脱绒设备之后，每担棉籽至少可增产棉绒四斤半。为了解决棉、毛、麻、丝不足，从长远来看，应该积极发展人造纤维。现已着手筹建一座人造纤维厂。麻袋工业利用胡麻、野麻、棉秆皮及其他纤维等与黄、洋麻混纺交织，也是节约原料增加产量的办法。在造纸工业方面，去年全国人民代表大会上曾经有代表提出研究利用其他浆料造纸，以节约木材；轻工业部根据这个提案，曾经利用稻草、甘蔗渣及其他浆料进行试验，并已确定在广东筹建一座利用甘蔗渣制浆造纸的工厂。在卷烟工业方面，今年全国平均每箱用烟量由原计划的一百二十二斤，下降到不超过一百二十斤，是完全可以做到的。为了解决卷烟原料不足，还可提倡栽培二茬烟和剥烟茎皮。在制糖工业方面，机制糖减少损耗，增加产糖率，如东北甜菜糖厂今年计划不增加原料即可增产一千四百多吨糖；土糖产量大，出糖率低，应加强管理，改进技术，提高产量。在橡胶工业中，轮胎采用新设计，以提高质量，节约用胶，胶鞋采用上海某些先进厂的缝帮套楦，鞋底分段等办法，力争今年全年节约生胶一千五百吨。油脂工业努力推广李川江榨油法，提高出油率，并积极利用蚕蛹、橘皮、向日葵籽、蓖麻籽及其他核仁榨油，力争完成增产十万吨食油的任务。皮革工业除照顾某些少数民族外，一般可使用猪皮及其他杂皮制革，并准备制造人造皮革，以代替和节约牛皮。为了节约粮食，还应积极寻找酿酒、饲料的代用原料。此外，加强对于废胶、废棉、破布、旧纸及其他一切可用废料的回收与使用，减少原料在运输和保管中的耗损。所有这些，都是有很大的经济意义的。我们必须发挥群众的积极性和创造性，发挥科学机关和试验研究机构的作用，加强试验研究工作，来合理使用并扩大原料资源。
    轻工业中由于某些产品质量不好，废品、次品很多，也造成了很大浪费。正如有些代表所批评的，
  一九五四年轻工业产品中，药品和医疗器械的质量问题最为突出，针剂的厂内废品率一般在百分之二十到三十之间，常用的七十种片剂中，有四十五种经常发生含量不足，不易溶化。轻工业部所属药厂和医疗器械厂在厂内也经常出现废品和返工，甚至某些产品出厂后还发生退货现象。这种情况虽在近半年来有了改进，但还不够，也未稳定。纺织工业中，去年经常约有三分之一的厂子完不成棉布正品率计划。造纸的质量计划，有些厂经常不能完成，印刷用纸，往往杂质多而光滑度不够。橡胶工业中，去年一个时期有的轮胎行驶不到一万公里就爆破（计划指标为二万五千公里）；有的橡胶雨衣黏在一起；有的胶鞋不经穿。此外，如食品不洁、啤酒混浊、肥皂开裂发软等，都还没有彻底解决。这就必然造成原材料、资金、人力、设备的浪费，加大了产品成本，并引起消费者的不满。这也说明：技术工作是我们轻工业企业管理中的一个薄弱环节。因此，必须抓紧修订产品标准、改进工艺规程和加强检验制度三个环节来改进技术工作，加强技术领导，健全责任制度，才能切实保证和提高产品质量。
      有些同志认为，强调节约原材料，就不能强调提高质量，或者认为强调提高质量，就不能强调节约原材料。这是不对的。保证和提高质量，并不是要浪费用料，恰恰相反，质量不好，废品和不及格品多，正是对原材料最大的浪费。节约用料应该是提高技术，改进管理的结果，绝不能是偷工减料、粗制滥造的结果。因此，节约原材料的同时，必须注意保证和提高质量；同样，保证和提高质量的同时，也必须注意节约原材料。
    轻工业生产企业的管理费偏高、流动资金占用过多，周转过慢，也是一种不容忽视的浪费。
      企业管理费偏高的主要原因之一，是企业机构过于庞大，非生产人员过多，因而加大了开支，助长了无人负责的现象。企业流动资金浪费的主要原因，是由于仓库积压过多，周转不快。例如一九五四年轻工业部占用的流动资金超过计划百分之二十七，其中原材料超额储备和呆滞、积压部分占百分之七十以上。这也说明成本财务工作是我们轻工业企业管理中又一个薄弱环节。
    所有原材料的浪费、产品质量的低劣，以及企业管理费的偏高，都必然最后集中地反映为产品的成本过高。有些同志对于工业管理，只注意完成生产计划，不注意成本财务计划；只注意完成数量、产值计划，不注意品种和质量计划；不精打细算，不注意经济效果；甚至不但不正视这些缺点，反而滋长了一种骄傲自满的情绪。这是不对的。今后必须强调思想政治工作，加强成本财务管理和技术领导，严格建立与健全原材料和资金的管理制度，改进劳动组织，认真定额定员，贯彻经济核算，提高劳动生产率。只有努力提高企业的技术水平和管理水平，才能不断地挖掘轻工业生产方面的巨大潜力，实现增产节约的各项措施，不断地提高产量、质量、降低成本，为国家增加积累，保证国家计划全
  面的超额完成。
    在供应人民生活必需品方面，私营工业和手工业还有重大的作用。国家应加强对私营工业和手工业的社会主义改造，并根据统筹兼顾的方针，逐行逐业地安排其生产。私营工业和手工业也必须积极改善经营管理，提高技术，提高质量，节约原料，降低成本，以适应社会需要和国家建设的要求。
      如果说，在轻工业生产方面的主要任务是增产节约，为国家增加积累，那末，在基本建设方面就应当是克服浪费，为国家节省投资。五年计划草案规定轻工业基本建设投资约占全部工业投资的百分之十一点二，这个比例是适当的。国家投到工业建
  设上来的资金，必须集中使用，优先发展重工业。这一点，上面已经说过了。对此，我们不应该有任
  何的怀疑。还要看到：目前全国各地各经济类型的
  轻工业和广大的手工业，由于原料不足，仍有很大
  的潜力可资利用，如果我们不估计到这种情况，片
  面地过分地强调需要而不管原料供应的可能，强调轻工业的发展而不顾重工业的发展，只顾国营而不
  管私营和手工业，只看到本地而不看到全国，因而在轻工业方面盲目投资，大量新建或改建扩建，那
  就很可能是建成了厂，但却因原料供应不上而开不
  了工，或者是新厂开工，旧厂停工，国营新建，私
  营停工，此地新建，彼地停工，现代工业新建，手
  工业停工，这样就会给国家带来巨大的浪费。轻工
  业在过去几年的基本建设中，虽然大部分项目是适当的，合理的，但也有一些项目是可以不建或缓建
  的，如麻袋工厂，金笔、钢笔、铅笔工厂，针剂、
  片剂工厂，医疗器械工厂等，都多了些，或早了些，这不仅造成了基建投资的浪费，也增加了目前
  生产安排的困难。
      因此，今年春天，根据中共中央和国务院的指
  示，重新计算了社会需要量，原料可供量，及现有各类型轻工业的生产能力，削减和推迟了纺织工业和轻工业原来列入计划草案中的若干应当削减和可
  以推迟的基建项目；节减下来的资金，如果投资于重工业建设，就可以办一个年产一万五千辆的拖拉
  机厂和两个年产一百万吨的炼油厂。这一措施是完
  全必要的、正确的。
    但，这并不是说轻工业方面一概不要新建和改建了，不是的。凡是产品为社会所必需，原料有可靠保证，现有企业又不能满足生产要求的那些必要的基本建设，还是应该而且必须进行的。如若干纸厂、糖厂、人造纤维厂、抗生素厂等，都已经列入五年计划进行建设。有些原料没有困难而又有必要的建设项目，还可在年度计划中考虑增加进去。
    在正确的确定轻工业的基本建设计划之后，主要的任务就是如何又好、又快、又省的来完成它。必须在设计、施工、安装各个环节上，厉行节约，反对浪费。不能不分主要次要，不分缓急轻重，平均分散使用投资力量。轻工业部过去两年的投资使用上就有这种毛病，据初步检查约有五分之一的投资是用得不够合理或者可以节省的。因此，应对一切基建项目，进行严格审查，凡是可以不建、缓建、不投资或少投资的，就应当不建、缓建、不投资或少投资，以节约国家投资，充分发挥投资效果。不能借口“百年大计，质量第一”，就可以“用钱多少，在所不惜”。不能对生产性的建设和非生产性的建设不加区别。对生产性的建设应该要求达到一定的现代化的水准，因为这是对提高生产有利的和必需的。但对非生产性的建设也一律要求达到现代化的水平则是错误的，因为这样就会把国家有限的资金积压在不能生产的部分，从而限制了生产的发展，助长了奢侈和浪费的风气。最近轻工业部、纺织工业部两个部和地方工业方面，根据中共中央和国务院的节约指示，对第一个五年计划草案中的今后三年的基本建设计划和投资，在逐项逐目作了研究和审查后，又进行了第二次削减，前后两次削减的数目共计约占原来的五年基建拨款总数的百分之三十。西安正在筹建中的十万纱锭的国棉五厂如果按照已建成的三厂四厂的布局和标准来设计，原来计划要投资七千万元左右，现在根据全面节约的新精神，重新核算，适当修改标准和定额，降低造价；据该厂负责筹建的同志对我说，只要五千万元上下就够了。由此可见，只要能够严格遵守国家制定的定额标准，纠正一切片面、冒进、喜新、好大、宽打、滥用、铺张、浪费等偏向，深入检查，厉行节约，我们就能为国家节省大量资金。
    在第一个五年计划期间，轻工业主要依靠发挥现有生产潜力，再加上新建改建项目中有一部投入生产的结果，几项主要产品一九五七年的计划产量将比一九五二年的产量有显著的增长。如棉布（不包括土布）增长百分之四十五点八，面粉（不包括个体手工业的）增长百分之五十六，糖（包括个体手工业的）增长百分之一百四十四，盐（包括个体手工业的）增长百分之五十二点七，食用植物油
  （包括个体手工业的）增长百分之八十二点六，纸
  （包括个体手工业的）增长百分之六十五点五，胶鞋增长百分之七十五点六，火柴增长百分之三十九点四。应当说，这样的发展规模和速度不能算小，也不能算慢，这是基本上可以满足人民生活需要的。大体上说，是我们在目前国民经济基础和生产水平所能得到的东西。自然，这点东西还不能充分满足社会需要。因为在我们这样的国家，社会需要的增长总是走在生产前面的。我们必须尽一切可能来努力增加生产，以求逐步满足日益增长的社会需要。现在我们所从事的建设事业，正是为了这个目的。让我们满怀信心地沿着社会主义的康庄大道胜利前进！
    刀京版代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”以及其他的几个报告，并且要在自己的岗位上为实现第一个五年计划而努力工作。
    云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区成立以来，在共产党和上级国家机关的正确领导下，进一步加强了民族团结，在培养民族干部、发展生产、贸易、文教、卫生以及其他各项建设等工作方面，都取得了显著成就，从而使自治区出现了新的面貌。
    自从我国宪法颁布以后，德宏自治区各民族各阶层人民，都欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护，纷纷提出“要同全国各兄弟民族一道，逐步地过渡到社会主义社会”。但是，在我区目前还存在着封建的土地制度，束缚着广大劳动农民生产力的发展，农民没有土地，这就妨碍了农民的生产积极性和影响农民的生活。这种不合理的制度，是当前阻碍我区各民族发展进步的主要因素，是人民长期贫困的根源。这一点，过去我们是不清楚的。几年来，经过党和人民群众的教育，经过到各地方的参观和学习，看到社会改革以后的新气象，才逐渐认识到只有改革了旧的社会制度，才能发展生产，才能使我们自治区各民族摆脱贫困和落后，同全国各兄弟民族一道，逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。所以于一九五四年在群众的要求和我们的自愿放弃之下，宣布废除了官租。今年四月间，自治区人民政府委员会召开了会议，根据德宏地区的具体情况，制定了傣族地区“调整土地条例草案”，依照这个条例草案，采取和平协商的方法，进行了土地调整的试点工作。在试点工作中，由于党的领导，干部正确的执行了政策，依靠了群众，并得到本民族公众领袖的赞助，因而在六月底试点工作已基本上顺利结束，无田农民每人分得了五百斤以上产量的土地。现在，新分得土地的农民正辛勤愉快地在自己的土地上劳动着，他们兴奋地说：“过去共产党毛主席领导我们打倒了国民党反动派，推翻了压在我们头上的大石头，现在我们改革了土地制度，我们就可以组织互助合作，走向社会主义社会了。”这样，人民更加拥护共产党和人民政府，人民和自治机关的关系更加密切了。而我自己，也因此感到只要我们放弃过去的立场，今天为人民作点好事，那末，不仅人民不会抛弃我们，而且会爱护我们，所以个人也感觉非常愉快。在改革以前，由于帝国主义和国民党残匪的造谣挑拨，我们对社会改革是提心吊胆的。但在经过试点以后，我们看到党的政策是正确的，顾虑消除了，使我们深深体会到：只有相信共产党，永远跟着共产党走，好好学习，为人民办好事，才是唯一的前途。
    在试点改革中，由于我们警惕不高，许多干部和群众存在着严重的和平麻痹思想，使美帝国主义及国民党残匪的特务、反革命分子有机可乘，不断地进行破坏活动，他们企图用挑拨团结、散布谣言、威胁群众、破坏生产，甚至杀人放火等罪恶活动来破坏我们的改革工作。对于美帝国主义及其走狗的这种反革命活动，我们是决不能容忍的。今后我们在全区进行改革中，要特别注意加强团结，提高警惕，防止反革命分子的任何破坏，惩办那些敢于破坏改革、违抗人民政府政策法令的反革命分子，这样才能保证我们改革工作的胜利进行。
    改革土地制度，这是我区当前的中心工作，同时我们也要积极努力地去实现宪法所规定的各项自治权利，尤其是使用本民族文字的问题。过去由于傣文和景颇文本身还不够完善，我们也没有抓紧这
  一工作，所以自治机关很少运用本民族文字行使职权，学校里面则完全没有使用民族文字。现在傣文已经过适当改进，景颇文亦正改进中，我们已成立了一个翻译机构，并正在训练干部，准备逐步推广本民族文字，这样才能更好地发挥自治机关的作用，才能很快地普及教育和发展本民族的文化，也便于吸收汉族的先进文化，提高本民族人民的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟。
    在中国共产党和上级国家机关的正确领导下，在各民族尤其是汉族人民的支援和汉族干部的帮助下，我们满怀信心地做好这些工作，争取早日赶上先进的兄弟民族，逐步地进入社会主义社会！

    我们听了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”以后，结合学习了五年计划草案，我们认识到：对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是我国建设社会主义事业必要的组成部分之一。计划中指出，第一个五年计划的基本任务之一是：“基本上把资本主义工商业分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础”。这就说明了在第一个五年计划时期内，资本主义工商业的改造工作将在现有的基础上大大向前推进一步。
    资本主义工商业的改造，是一个艰巨、复杂的长期工作，要实现这个任务，必须进行一系列的工作。我们从过去辅导这一工作中体会到：增产节约是一种改造资本主义工业的有效办法；凡是认真进行了增产节约的，无论它是已经走上国家资本主义的各种形式的工业，或正在创造条件的私营工业，都在一定程度上提高了产品的数量和质量，改善了公私关系、劳资关系，改变了企业的落后状况。这是私营工业接受社会主义改造的一个重要步骤。
    最近一年多来，重庆市已有九十七个厂进行了增产节约工作，不少的厂通过这一运动，已经在企业的改造上有着显著成效，而且也促进了资本家思想的改造与提高。如私营大明纺织厂过去管理混乱，领导薄弱，浪费很大，在生产任务上长期不能达到国家的要求。去年九月在党的领导下开展了增产节约运动后，组织职工制定了生产计划，资方在运动中也受到了教育，提高了认识，依靠工人改进了技术和管理，在不到一年的时间内，设备仍是过去的那些设备，职工仍是过去那些职工，但由于开展了增产节约的运动，因而产品品质有了显著的提高，用棉量大大减少了。如去年八月每件纱用棉四百零三斤，今年三月降为三百八十七斤，仅这一项，一年就可以节约原棉价值八万多元，企业也就从过去的亏损转为有盈余。又有一家出口业的肠衣厂，过去由于资方的资本主义经营思想很严重，浪费大，成本高，每一支肠衣的加工费高达一角五分钱还要赔本。开展增产节约运动后，在工人提出了
  “多做一桶肠衣，多买半吨钢材”的口号下，每一支肠衣的加工费降为五分二，品质合乎出口标准，企业还有钱赚。此外，重庆肥皂业在增产节约运动中利用了廉价而供应无缺的泡花碱来代替部分木油，全年可节约一万多担木油，增产肥皂六、七万箱；皮革业由于技术改进，废品率由百分之五十降到百分之十以下，因而完成了国家投放的任务。
    我们从以上事例初步总结出几点经验：一、私营工业的增产节约运动首先要依靠党的领导，只有在党的领导下，才能做到发扬民主，充分协商，发挥各个组织的作用。另外，工商联、民主建国会也要充分重视这一工作，要同工会紧密联系配合，采取一致的步调，帮助和教育资方克服消极等待思想，积极投入运动。二、针对私营工业产品质量低、成本高、浪费大的缺点，从制定和贯彻生产计划着手，来逐步改变私营工业生产的盲目性，改变经营管理的落后状况，保证完成国家任务。三、大力组织技术研究，奖励和帮助创造发明，经常注意总结和推广先进经验，迅速提高技术水平，提高品质，降低成本，打开销路。
    但是，我们回忆过去在协助私营工业的增产节约工作上是走了不少弯路的。最大的缺点是抓得不紧，有时流于形式。一直到今天，有的工商户还存在依赖等待的消极思想；还有不少的资方和资方代理人对于增产节约的重大意义缺乏应有的认识；在运动中也还发现有扩大开支、抽逃资金，投机取巧的活动，没有从思想上接受改造，对于生产经营也仍然采取粗制滥造不负责任的态度，因而返工大，废品多，甚至偷工减料，重犯“五毒”的现象也不时在发生。今年四月间，我们检查了钢铁机器、电工器材等五个行业的七十份加工订货合同的执行情况，就发现违约违法事件占了百分之三十几。又检查到一家机器厂，在承制国营纺织厂的五千套皮辊任务中，废品率竟达到百分之三十九点几。这些情况充分说明，我们过去在思想教育工作方面做得不够，我们的工作还过于简单粗糙，今后必须坚决改正，紧紧记住：“对资本主义企业的改造，需要同资本家思想的改造结合进行”的宝贵经验。
    此外，为了帮助私营工业更好地进行增产节约工作，我们还需要照顾到私营工业目前存在的某些问题。据我们了解：国营企业目前对某些加工订货任务的投放，有的是在季度前不久才分配，有的是在季度开始后才陆续分配，而国营专业公司对原材料的供应，规定要在季度前五十天提出计划和订立供销合同，因此使私营厂遭遇到生产任务与原材料供应不能配合的实际困难。此外，还有某些国营企业分配任务后，有时中途变更计划，使私营厂很难订立生产计划，造成损失。这些问题都是由于过去的计划性不强，内部联系不够所造成的脱节现象，我们相信，今后随着国家计划的严格控制，一定能够得到合理解决。
    最后，我们感觉到在报告和计划中，政府对于国家机关、国营企业那些浪费行为提出了严厉批评，但是我们也应该看到，私营工商业在这方面的错误情况是很严重的。我们必须加强管理，防止浪费，努力积累资金，把一切资金的使用，逐步纳入国家计划之内。我们必须毫无例外地同国营企业一道，向一切浪费行为作不调和的斗争，保证我们的积累不被分散，不被盗窃，不被挪用于不必要的用途，以壮大我国社会主义建设的力量，以加速我们国家的工业化。
    我们的第一个五年计划即将通过，这在我们全国人民是最感兴奋的大事。我们的敌人正在仇恨我们，诅咒我们，采取种种方法来破坏我们的五年计划。我们在声讨胡风反革命集团的斗争中，曾发现工商界内也有人受到胡风的毒素渗透；又在视察工作中，曾发现许多反革命分子勾结奸商破坏粮食政策的罪恶活动，对于这些坏分子，我们一定要坚决给以无情的打击。国家在实施五年计划中，对资本主义工商业每一个企业，各一个人都是一个严重的考验，希望工商界朋友们同全国人民一道，随时提高警惕，分清敌我，下定决心，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，忠诚接受社会主义改造，展开全面的增产节约运动，为拥护国家第一个五年计划的贯彻实现而奋斗。
    陈嘉庚代表的发言
    在此次大会上，听了李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理及彭真副委员长各项报告，我完全同意并衷心拥护。
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是我国数千年来未有之盛举，此一伟大计划将鼓舞国外华侨与全国人民一道，更加团结在中国共产党和毛主席之周围，为实现此伟大计划而努力。
    毛主席说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”第一个五年计划就是为我国建设国家的社会主义工业化奠定基础，在苏联全面援助下，两年来之实施中，已有许多显著成就，如各项重工业之建设，相应对轻工业、铁路、交通运输、农林水利之发展均比解放前增长数倍，速度之快为各资本主义国家望尘莫及。由于各项建设事业之发展，人民之物质生活和文化生活已不断改善，国际地位空前提高，国防力量大大增强，因而粉碎了蒋介石卖国集团复辟迷梦，也粉碎了帝国主义之侵略野心。但是敌人是不甘心于失败，他们用尽千方百计想来破坏我国之社会主义建设，敌人所进行之阴谋活动是极凶狠恶毒，我政府过去对暗藏的蒋匪特务及反革命分子之镇压尚不够彻底，甚至是宽恕。从高、饶之叛党和此次潘汉年、胡风反革命丑类之阴谋活动，不能不引起我们必须严重注意和警惕。相信：只要全国人民提高警惕，全心全意协助政府肃清匪特，反革命之残余是不难扑灭的。
      “关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划”，乃我国历史上一件大事，第一期工程完成后，黄河流域之自然面貌将有巨大变化，几千年来为害人民之河流将变为富国利民之河流，此也只有在毛泽东时代始能有之。此一伟大规划不但鼓舞全国人民，也鼓舞一千二百万热爱祖国之华侨，进而将加强华侨对祖国人民政府之拥护与自豪。
    在此次会议上，大家对农业生产也甚为关心，两年来虽然有些省份遭大水害，福建、广东有部分地方也为数十年来未有之大旱灾，但从全国统计，农业生产还是年有增加，国家建设计划并不因有些地区遭到灾害而受影响。在基本建设方面，两年来也有相当成就，但也不能否认，在此两年来对建筑屋舍方面是有不少浪费损失，这种情况报纸屡有登载，李富春、李先念两副总理在报告中亦有着重指出。窃意国家建设与建筑事业有密切关系，此首次五年计划，包括之重轻工业、文化、卫生、城市、乡村，莫不与建筑攸关。所谓衣、食、住为人类不可缺之事，以我国之大、人民之众、工业化之初基、人民之福利，除旧布新，日趋于现代化。首都及各大城市之建设将为全国模范。居模范地位者戒奢戒浪费甚为重要。谨将所见所闻略陈如下：
  前闻普通建筑费，每平方公尺约一百二十元，近闻有许多处至二百余元，亦有至三百元，增加一倍以上之巨。若在解放初年，新建屋舍工程未有经验，乏标准预算，尚有可言；现在已历多年，已有相当经验，凡拟建一座楼屋，必先绘成图案：用何种材料，若干平方公尺，建费若干万元，已予规定，交负责机关办理；设有出入亦应极有限度，何至俟工程完竣然后知道？
    我去冬来京，访北京华侨中等补习学校，据云其建筑费每平方公尺一百二十左右元，若闽南厦门大学、集美学校，此四年来建成校舍数十座，面积十余万平方公尺，每公尺平均三十四、五元，工资物价与京相差不多，言坚固美观似不逊色，如包括体育场（每学生平均面积五平方公尺）、下水道、水井、道路、电火等每平方公尺才四十元，惟无暖气及自来水管设备。其绘图及管理费约占百元之五元左右，闻：厦门市有一建筑公司需百元之二十余元、此间亦需二十左右元，如果属实，乃建筑浪费之一也。
    建屋搭木架问题，闽南屋墙如用砖造，虽四五层楼，免搭木架，工人立在墙上叠砖，砖料搬置在楼上，用小工用手取交与墙上操作工人，如屋墙用石料，每条石二三百斤，则须搭木架，然甚简单，仅搭一梯路架，可容四个人扛上而已。新加坡建楼屋三四层居多，七八层至十余层则少，建筑工人闽南人居多，屋墙概用砖造，操作以两人合作，一在墙内，一在墙外，虽搭有木架，乃系建筑师规定安全标准架，但亦甚简单，待施工将到则搭之，大不似此间木架数重，密如鱼鳞，未及施工就早搭备，甚至尚未动工，而全座木架已先搭，不但无谓浪费，更须预防日久腐烂危险，不知此种搭架法，是工人旧习，抑是建筑师安全规定。
    建筑学校礼堂或公众会堂，最忌回音，较重者竟乱听闻，建筑师须另用种种隔音材料，或可有效。我看过多处会堂，回音者不少，不回音者亦有，但其窗户及屋内高低，无何差别，回音之原因何在，莫明其故。去年建成集美学校礼堂坐位四千余人，今年建成厦门大学礼堂坐位五千余人，均不回音，全屋均无何特殊设备，只有坐位均作斜坡，为后排观剧，免被前排遮塞而设，每排地面降低三寸，前后五十余排，高低百余寸，比较怀仁堂加斜些，怀仁堂亦不回音，我想不回音，是否与斜坡有关，我国建筑方始，爰敢介绍，以资参考。
    我国首次五年计划，重要性在发展工业，人民政府成立时，毛主席指示过：要将农业国变为工业国。欲增进地方繁荣，改善人民生活，非发展工业不能达到目的，工业之发展，必能增进我国对外贸易。南洋地多热带气候，植物矿产，多异我国，如煤铁、水泥、玻璃、纸张、纱布、丝绸、药材、水果以及工业日用品，有的为彼处所无而为我所有，均可外运以换取南洋特产的树胶、椰油、?莪、金鸡纳、及其他工业原料。
    我国沿海可泊一万吨至二、三万吨巨舰的港口，仅湛江、厦门、青岛、大连等处，南方适中良港，以厦门为最好，其与南洋交通线，较日本可少千里，较欧美可少数千里，不久铁路敷设到厦，华中及西南北等省，可取厦门为出入孔道，则南洋各属华侨，将更踊跃介绍中外物品贸易，增进工业生产与外汇，其利益之广大，不但福建一省而已。
    王鹤寿部长的发言
    我国第一个五年计划特别规定了要优先发展重工业，这是完全正确的。现在我仅就钢铁工业、有色金属工业、化学工业及建筑材料工业的一些情况及重工业部如何完成基本建设任务发表一些意见。
    大家都知道，过去由于帝国主义的侵略和国民党反动派的统治，使我国不可能建立和发展重工业，因而无论钢铁或有色金属，化学或建筑材料工业，基础都是十分薄弱的。解放以后，经过三年的恢复和两年多的建设，我们在苏联专家的帮助下，提高了原有企业的技术水平，扩大了旧有企业的产品种类，而且根据每年基本建设计划，完成了鞍钢的十个重点工程，完成了几个有色金属、化工及建筑材料的新建、扩建工程。这些工业虽然有了发展，但是它仍然是很落后的。它的落后不仅表现在数量上不能满足国家建设的需要，而且也表现在技术设备和技术水平落后，因而在产品品种上也远不能满足国家建设的需要。显然，不克服这几种工业的落后状态，它就不能正确地配合其他工业的发展，从而也就影响整个国民经济的顺利发展。
    我们怎样克服这种落后状态呢？这就一方面需要我们在已经投入生产的工厂矿山中，改进企业管理，提高技术水平，以提高产量和增加新的产品品种。几年来的经验证明，这是加速工业发展提高工业水平的一个重要方面。正是因为如此，我们不应该只注意建设新的而忽视现有生产厂矿的工作，我们需要把发挥现有生产设备的能力视为提高工业水平的一项重要源泉。但是要从根本上克服落后状态，更主要的一方面，是正确地执行第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设计划，保证按期完成五年计划中的几个钢铁基地和新的有色金属、化学、建筑材料生产基地的建设，大大提高这几类工业的能力。因为在我们重工业十分落后的国家里要实现社会主义工业化，更重要的是积极建设许多拥有最新技术设备的工厂矿山。我们不可能仅仅依靠现有的数量很少而且其中大部是设备落后的厂矿去实现社会主义工业化。因此为了克服我国工业的落后，为了实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，为了社会主义工业化，我们必须建设更多的以最新技术设备装备起来的钢铁、有色金属、化学等工业的工厂和矿山。
    但是，钢铁、有色金属、化学工业的建设是艰巨的和复杂的。从资源勘探开始，经过设计、施工到投入生产，需要一个比较长的时间。建设一个钢铁基地，从开始到完成就需要用十年左右的时间；就是建设一个中等规模的氮肥工厂也要五、六年的时间。这些企业的建设所以需要较长的时间，是因为在开始的时候必须将原料基地勘探清楚，获得足够的工业矿量后才能开始设计，而在设计的时候，又必须具备各种设计基础资料和作各种科学研究试验（如选矿、冶炼）；是因为这些企业需要大量的复杂的设备，例如建设一个年产一百五十万吨规模的钢铁厂就需要十五万吨以上的设备，一个年产九万吨的氮肥厂需要两万多吨设备，这些设备从设计到制造都是需要时间的；是因为这些企业的建筑安装工程量很大，施工的技术要求十分严格，一个年产一百五十万吨的钢铁厂，占地面积五平方公里，在厂区内要建设上百万平方公尺的厂房和仓库、一百多公里铁路、几百公里上下水道和各种管道，完成这些工程，是必须花出相当时间的；而且所有的工程，特别是基础工程、金属结构工程和设备安装工程，技术复杂，要求严格，有一个工厂仅仅一个设备基础就用了三万三千立方公尺的混凝土、一千吨钢筋，设备基础中心线的准确程度不允许有丝毫偏差，熟悉掌握这些工程的技术，是需要时间的。
    重工业部在第一个五年计划期间，面对着的基本建设工程，主要的就是这样一些由苏联帮助设计的、技术上复杂的、现代化的工厂和矿山。这是我们过去从未建设过，而且有的还是没有看到过的工程。过去两年来我们在党中央和国务院领导下一面工作一面学习，虽然基本上完成了国家的基本建设计划，但是两年来所完成的工作量还只是五年计划中的一少部分，还有大部分重要工程需要在以后的三年中完成。这就说明后三年的基本建设任务是繁重的。
    为了保证完成五年计划规定给重工业部的这一基本建设任务，应该采取什么具体措施呢？现在摆在重工业部面前的是一些什么问题呢？应怎样克服基本建设中的缺点错误和提高基本建设工作效率呢？我们的经验和知识都很少，根据两年来的实践和工作现状，我们认为摆在重工业部面前的问题，除了贯彻执行党中央和国务院的节约指示，坚决地克服我们工作中存在的许多严重浪费，并把这一工作做为经常的重要工作外，现在要求我们解决的问题是：积极勘探资源、准备原料基地；加强基本建设的通盘筹划与相互协作；提高设计水平、学会成套设计；组织建筑企业由民用建筑向工业建筑转变。我现在就这几个问题说明一些认识和正在采取的措施。
      一、建设黑色冶金和有色冶金工业，以及它们的规模和发展速度，首先取决于地质资源。没有大量的合于工业要求的铁矿、锰矿和足够的有色金属资源，钢铁工业和有色冶金工业的发展是不可能的。水泥、玻璃、硫酸和磷肥等工业的发展，也必须有可靠的、合乎工业要求的资源。我们目前在基本建设中，首先碰到并要求解决的就是这个如何准备原料基地问题。解放以后，特别是五年计划开始以来，我国进行了大量的地质勘探工作，因而初步的给钢铁企业及几个有色金属矿的开采提供了地质资源。但是由于我国过去地质工作薄弱，技术水平低，特别是缺乏经济地质工作，很多资源还没有勘探清楚；有些金属还没找到可靠的基地；有些金属目前探得的储量尚不能满足厂矿建设的要求；有些金属虽然在沿海地方有一定的储量，但是不能适应目前国家工业地区分布的要求，而我们需要建立工厂的地区目前还没有得到足以建立厂矿的各种资源。我们在今后工作中必须解决这一个重要问题。这就有赖于地质部和重工业部共同努力，加强地质调查工作以提供必要的和适应工业地区分布的原料基地。为此，重工业部几年来用了很大力量集结了一支地质勘探队伍，正在各地进行勘探。但是因为科学技术水平还低，故工作的质量也低；地质报告往往不能按时提出；矿区的综合研究很差，金属综合利用注意得也很不够，所以常常是在多种金属共生的情况下，我们只勘探一种金属，而没有注意其中还有其他大量的和很重要的金属。为了纠正这些缺点，我们正在注意从提高地质工作干部的思想水平和学习苏联地质工作经验来加强地质勘探工作，以提高勘探设计质量，提高综合研究工作，严格按照勘探程序工作，按期交出建设所需要的工业矿量，以保证给现在建设的钢铁、有色金属工业等提供原料基地，并为将来建设更多钢铁、有色金属厂矿创造原料基地。
    二、在有了原料基地着手进行建设时，马上需要正确处理的一个问题是：通盘筹划与组织相互协作。由于重工业厂矿建设所需时间长，技术复杂，在整个建设过程中，从计划的制定、地质勘探、科学研究和试验、设计的编制、设备材料的供应、建筑安装工程的进行、生产的准备工作等，到水电、交通的解决是一个十分复杂的过程，所以进行这些工作，不是一个单位，而必须是由许多单位分别负责才能进行的。过去我们对基本建设的这种复杂性认识不够，因而缺乏细致地通盘筹划，往往由于某一个单位的工作没有考虑周到或者某一件小事没有考虑到，就拖延了建设时间。例如我们曾在计划上规定一个矿山投入生产的时间，但没有同时给地质勘探部门规定完成矿量的限期，结果由于矿量提交很晚不能按时开始设计，而建设时间不得不拖迟；有时地质部门勘探出了必要的矿量，但科学研究和试验工作没有及时对矿石做出选矿及冶炼的试验和研究，结果仍然耽误了下一步工作的进行。由于筹划和协作不好，设计不能按时提交，设备、材料不能配合施工，因而影响工程进度的现象是经常发生的。由于筹划和协作不好，没有及时做好生产准备，就使已竣工的工程，不能正常投入生产，鞍钢的两个重要工程就曾发生过这样情形：一个工程因为没有注意到一种滚珠轴承的准备，一个工程没有注意到安装运转时所需要的一种特殊的润滑油，结果这两个工程在竣工时，不得不采取紧急措施，用飞机把所缺的滚珠轴承和润滑油运来。两年来我们有些工程没有按期投入生产，除了一部分是客观原因外，大部分是因为通盘筹划和相互协作不够所造成的。接受过去的经验教训，为了保证工业建设的按期投入生产，必须建立建设单位（即通称的甲方）的工作。建设单位必须负责进行整个建设的、从头到尾的通盘筹划与组织各方面的相互协作，根据国家计划规定的时间和要求，制定总进度计划，组织有关单位根据总进度计划安排其工作。这就是把从设计起到投入生产止一系列的、相互关联的工作组织起来，使之相互衔接，都在规定的时间内完成各个阶段的工作。
    三、有了一定的原料基地，有了正确的建设计划，如果没有正确的设计，仍然是建设不起来或者建设不好的。因为设计工作对一个企业的建设在技术上、经济上是否合理，起着决定性作用。但是设计工作薄弱和水平低下却正是目前建设中的一个严重问题。在第一个五年计划中，重工业部进行的工业建设项目，主要部分是委托苏联设计的，但还有相当数量的设计是在苏联专家指导下由自己进行设计的。如以投资额来计算，委托苏联设计的约占投资总额的百分之六十，自己设计的约占百分之四十。因此保证按时完成这些设计项目对完成五年计划就有着重大作用。为了担负起目前的设计任务，几年来我们曾初步集结了设计的力量，成立了四个设计院，除进行了一些民用建筑的设计外，并进行了一部分工业设计。但是，我们的设计工作还是非常落后的，这种落后特别表现在我们还不会进行成套设计。由于过去各个设计院的设计水平低，所以都还没有进行过大的复杂的工业设计，不会作综合性企业的总体设计，还只能做一个工厂或矿山中某一车间或某一部分的设计；或者只会做技术设计而不能正确的规划设计任务和初步设计；许多重大的技术经济原则不能正确地决定。因此摆在重工业部面前的问题是：必须要在几年之内努力学会作成套设计。今年我们即开始进行五十五个新建项目的设计，这些设计就是要从编制计划任务书、初步设计、技术设计到施工图成套地进行学习。各个设计院都有苏联专家指导工作，又有许多苏联设计资料，国内生产厂矿和施工单位也不断出现新的经验，这都是设计人员学习成套设计的有利条件。动员设计人员努力学习并加以组织和领导，是一定可以学会的。
    四、组织建筑企业由民用建筑向工业建筑转变是完成五年基本建设计划的又一个环节。我们的建筑队伍，开始是搞民用建筑和小规模的工业建筑的。从一九五二年鞍山大型轧钢厂开始，特别是从
  一九五四年许多重大工程建设开始后，我们即开始组织建筑企业由民用建筑向工业建筑转变。由于工业建筑技术要求高，质量要求严，建筑安装工程量很大，特种工程如基础、筑炉、管道、金属结构等很多，像过去民用建筑时采用的那种组织管理和施工方法已经不能适应这种工业建设了。过去我们对工业建筑的复杂性认识不足，组织向工业建筑转变上存在着许多缺点，因此造成施工不均衡，质量事故，劳动生产率低，严重浪费等现象。为了适应工业建筑的要求，我们正在根据不同的技术，组织专业的工程公司（机械和电气安装公司、筑炉公司、管道安装公司、金属结构公司、矿山建设公司等等），使它精通专门技术；学习像工厂一样的按照施工作业计划进行施工；分地区组织必要的附属工厂；学习施工机械化；逐步实行专业工程公司的统一调配。
    根据两年来的经验，工业建设不同于民用建筑，还在于施工前有大量的准备工作，而且必须作好施工前的准备工作。一个重工业企业的建设，在开工前必须要有三、四个月或半年的准备，工程量大而复杂的建设则需要一年或一年以上时间的准备。在准备过程中需要编好施工总进度计划，作好施工组织设计，解决水电、交通问题，确定施工方案，准备施工材料，安排施工力量，学习施工图纸。只有这些工作做好了，才不会发生半途停工的现象，才能保证质量。
    由于一个工厂或矿山的建筑是由许多专业性工程公司施工，一个工地往往有五、六个公司和几十种工种从屋顶到地下同时施工，所以需要加强施工的组织工作。各个工程公司要相互协作、相互创造条件，这就要求以土木建筑工程公司（即大包）为主，组织各专业工程公司共同制定综合作业计划，在一个施工的现场上统一指挥各个工程公司的行动，没有这种统一指挥就会互相妨碍，不能保证工程按期竣工。
    这些就是目前我们在基本建设方面所采取的一些具体措施。
    最后，还应当特别指出，敌人对我们社会主义工业的建设是仇恨的，必然要千方百计地进行破坏。潘汉年和胡风反革命集团阴谋的暴露以及其他反革命事件的破获的事实告诉我们，在工厂、矿山和基本建设企业中是暗藏着反革命分子的，他们利用各种伪装和利用我们工作上的各种弱点进行反革命的破坏活动。前几天就在一个重要工程中发现敌人企图破坏地下管道。不把这些暗藏的反革命分子从工厂、矿山、建筑安装企业和企业机关中清除出去，我们是不能顺利地进行基本建设的。因此我们要纠正埋头业务不问政治的错误倾向，提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫我们的基本建设。
    重工业的建设是困难的，而且还需要我们长期的艰苦努力，但是在共产党和国务院的领导下是没有什么困难不可克服的。两年多以来的实践证明，工人阶级在党的领导下可以发挥出无穷的智慧。同时我们还有一个在建设中起着巨大作用的因素，这就是苏联政府与苏联专家的无私帮助。在苏联专家直接帮助之下，基本建设中各方面的技术人员都有了极大的进步。我们已经完成了一些艰巨的工程，我们将向苏联专家学会建设更多艰巨的工程。过去在鞍钢的一个日本技术人员曾经轻蔑地说：“你们要想把鞍钢恢复到原来的水平，平心静气地讲，你们需要二十年。”现在我们有把握地说，在苏联专家帮助之下，我们用不到他说的一半时间，就不仅恢复它原来的水平，而且还将要在更高的技术水平上大大地超过它原来的水平。当然，在完成国家的伟大的五年计划中，我们的责任是重大的。因此我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，努力学习马克思列宁主义，注意政治思想工作，兢兢业业，力戒骄傲自满，动员全体职工努力工作。我们相信在共产党和国务院的领导下，有苏联专家直接帮助，依靠广大群众的积极性，一定能够胜利地完成第一个五年计划所规定给我们的任务。
    章伯钧部长的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。这个计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领，是一个引导全国人民沿着社会主义道路前进、使我国繁荣富强和人民幸福的伟大计划。在这个计划中，对运输和邮电事业的全体职工指明了努力奋斗的目标，规定了明确的方针和任务。计划规定了运输和邮电事业所必要的投资，国家将以基本建设总投资的百分之十九点二的资金用于运输和邮电。这个投资比例是根据目前国家经济条件规定的，是十分恰当的。大家知道，发展运输业是为了使运输能够适应于国家经济建设、工农业生产的发展、商品流通的扩大和人民的需要。因此，我们在五年内不仅应完成基本建设计划，并须严格地执行和完成运输的生产指标和财政上缴任务。按照计划规定：五年内内河货物周转量应增长百分之三百二十一点五，沿海货物周转量应增长百分之一百九十点五，内河及沿海船舶总载重吨（包括公私合营）应增加四十万吨，公路汽车运输货物周转量应增长百分之三百七十三点五，修建公路一万零一百公里以上，新增加通车里程为七千一百公里以上。这些生产和建设数字的提出，是符合于国家需要和现有的以及今后增长的生产能力的。
    从五年计划对运输部门的要求和规定的发展速度来看，任务是繁重的，但我们有信心完成它。事实上这个计划自一九五三年开始已经执行了两年多，这两年计划执行情况是好的。首先我们已经执行了第一个五年计划运输部门生产指标应有的速度。一九五三年至一九五四年两年内，水运和汽车运输完成的货物周转量已超过五年计划规定的平均速度百分之八至二十以上；公路和水运基本建设投资已达到五年计划规定总额的百分之四十一。其次，国营水运部门企业管理已有了一些改进，内河和沿海运输劳动生产率一九五四年比一九五二年提高百分之四十二点五，成本降低百分之三十。全国已有一百三十六家私营轮船业改组为十七家公私合营公司。如仅从交通部直接管理的内河、沿海运输来说，那末水运企业的经济成分比重已起了显著变化：在船舶载重量总额中，国营已占百分之六十二，公私合营占百分之三十六点四，私营仅占百分之一点六。全国公路至一九五四年止通车里程已达十四万二千公里，比一九五二年增长百分之九点九。康藏公路、青藏公路已经通车，许多重要的国防经济线路已经竣工。各省地方道路也有改进，例如河北省蓟县在过去四年中组织群众力量、就地取材进行整修和养护，共整修了公路二百六十二公里，使本县土产特产品和外地的日用品可以通畅运销。山东省某些地区利用当地各种不同土壤和石料而改善的原有土路，已达六百多公里，而且造价低，效果好，大大提高了运输效率。这里特别要说的是，从我历时九十天，经过十几个省市的交通工作检查中，我深深感到：中国共产党和人民政府正确的领导，工人阶级和广大人民群众在劳动战线上的积极性和创造性以及苏联专家的及时帮助，加以地方上各级干部勤恳努力，生气勃勃，认真执行上级所给予的任务，所有这些都成为我们一切事业成就的政治上和组织上的保证。因此，我们有信心完成并争取提前完成第一个五年计划对交通部门所规定的具体任务。
    但另方面，我们也必须认识到交通部门在第一个五年计划内任务是繁重的，要保证完成和争取提前完成这些任务，还必须做更多的努力，还必须认真地克服目前工作中的许多缺点和困难。
    第一，对水路、公路运输业的统筹兼顾全面安排工作作得很不够，对地方交通工作的具体指导和帮助少。首先表现在对运输工具缺乏全面安排。如西北省区运力不足，沿海省市运力有余，领导上没有及时深入了解情况，做到统一地合理地调配。其次，表现在对地方道路的整修缺乏具体计划和帮助，对有些本来花钱不多而为当地人民迫切需要的地方道路和桥梁的整修工作重视不够。例如湖南湘西苗族自治州，因运输条件不好，调运粮食需要大批劳动力，曾提出参加民工建勤义务修路的要求，这次大会上湖北、广西、广东等省区的代表提案中也提出修建各该地区道路的要求。会后交通部门应当在这方面加强注意。又如地方渡口大多数还处于无人管理的状态，如湖南祁阳县扒江乡渡船，曾因超载翻船淹死多人。此外，对私营运输业积极改造和妥善安排注意不够，个别地区还有排挤现象，产生上述这些问题的原因，主要由于我们领导上抓了直属事业放松了地方交通，抓了国营放松了私营，抓了现代企业忽视了民间运输工具。我们没有做到全面安排各种运输工具，及时解决地方急待解决的问题。
    第二，江海运输方面海损事故尚多，成本仍高，现有设备潜力还未能充分发挥。近年来，水运部门虽与海损事故作了不断地斗争，但海损事故仍然严重。去年仅长江、沿海即发生海事九百零八起，一九五四年内河及沿海运输货损责任事故二千六百多起。
    海损事故多、货损货差多的原因，一方面是由于政治思想领导薄弱，教育不够，技术管理不够，有些船员不按航行规章办事，劳动纪律松弛等；另一方面是由于交通部门人员政治情况极为复杂，过去虽经过民主改革和镇压反革命等工作，但清理极不彻底；潜藏在交通部门的反革命分子及盗窃、贪污、走私等分子的破坏活动还极为严重。这应引起我们严重警惕，并进一步作好清理工作。
    此外，船上和汽车上对旅客服务态度差，设备不好，特别是川江客船不足，旅客拥挤。交通部对此深觉抱歉，今后要大力改善。
    第三，公路建设上浪费很大。由于盲目追求高标准，片面强调技术标准等级，脱离了经济适用的原则，不关心造价的精密计算，浪费严重。如四川成都至阿坝线运量很小，却按五等路标准修建，每公里造价达六万多元。华南区个别线路因强求路线顺直，每公里造价达九万余元。在其他公路施工中由于赶任务，忽视节约和工程质量，缺乏财务监督和技术监督，也造成许多浪费，有些单位间接费用高达百分之三十以上。这种脱离实际、忽视经济的倾向是严重存在的。目前公路系统正在开展反浪费运动，本着少花钱多修路的原则，根据具体情况，尽量作到就地取材，降低造价。
    为了胜利地完成第一个五年计划，我们要做以下工作：
      （一）对各种运输工具贯彻统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针。我国现有各种不同经济类型的运输工具，应该按照货物种类、流向及其对运输上的具体要求，结合运输工具的特点及其分布状况，合理地分配各种运输工具的运输任务，以充分发挥一切运输工具的作用，为国家提供量大、质好、成本低廉和安全快速的运输力。为此，交通部今后必须加强经济调查，摸清货源货流情况，经常研究国民经济发展的规律，掌握全国各种运输工具的使用情况。还必须在以铁路运输为主的原则下，充分利用我国水运的优良条件，发挥水运的作用。汽车（包括机关企业汽车）及木帆船、兽力车等运输工具在地区性短程运输中的作用很大，除满足工业基地及城市运输需要外，应面向农村，适应初级市场的运输需要。积极的实行水陆联运、江海联运以及直达运输等，有步骤地组织全国运输网。此外，对资本主义运输业通过公私合营和对个体运输业通过合作化的道路，逐步进行社会主义改造，纳入国家计划轨道。
      （二）加强地方交通工作。自一九五三年经政务院批准地方交通划归地方管理后，各地党政对这方面加强了领导，完成了巨大的运输任务，做了许多建设工作。但由于大区机构撤销后，有关省与省间的运输配合、章则制度和技术标准的制定与修正，均须逐步解决。特别是地方上各种运输工具的发展和配合，须要统筹安排，以便充分发挥它在短程运输中的作用。并须加强对公路、航道的养护，制定地方道路标准，利用民工建勤，因地制宜，就地取材，修整一些适合当地运输工具的道路，和改善一些运量很大的公路路况；或者采用由国家补助
  一部材料费用的办法修建个别意义重大的道路。以及注意整治有运输作用的中小河流，加强渡口管理。对于上述这些问题，准备召开地方交通会议着重加以解决，并拟研究交通部门的组织分工问题，以便明确任务、因地制宜地在各级党、政直接领导下，使地方交通工作大大前进一步。
      （三）改进与提高现有企业的经营管理水平，在加强经济技术定额工作的基础上，逐步实行全面的计划管理和实施经济核算制。根据各企业的不同情况，有计划有步骤地进行各种生产改革与技术改革。做好经济调查，加强商务工作，积极组织货源，提高运输质量，减少货损货差。改善运输组织，加强调度工作与港口作业。改善旅客运输，适当增加客船设备，保证旅客安全。特别应积极加强经济技术定额的查定工作，建立专职的技术管理机构，制定必要的技术管理制度，以加强技术管理。
      （四）有效地运用国家投资。根据中央“增加生产、厉行节约”的精神，把国家资金使用在保证运力的不断增长上面。水运方面，在内河以长江为重点，兼顾其他内河。沿海要保证满足国防和内外贸易的需要，完成湛江建港及扩建海运设备的任务。规划船型，增建技术良好的以蒸汽机为动力的船舶。扩建港口，改善航道航标。进行各地主要内河的调查勘测和规划工作，为今后逐步地把全国水系联结成水路运输网打下基础。公路建设则以修筑主要的国防及经济线路为重点，降低工程造价，保证质量，依靠地方民力财力，加强现有公路的养护，并修建适合于当地运输需要的道路、桥梁、渡船等。
    （五）根据交通事业的发展计划，相应地培养各种专门的技术干部和管理干部。通过各种学习，提高在职人员的政治思想水平和业务技术水平，使现有在职的老干部、技术人员、青年知识分子和技术工人，经过若干年的培养和锻炼后，成为交通事业的骨干。
    以上五项工作，是今后交通部较为长期的工作。在执行这些工作任务中，首先必须加强政治思想工作，广泛深入地进行社会主义的教育，激发和提高全体职工的革命热情和社会主义的觉悟程度。彻底整顿我们的队伍，肃清水路、公路系统中一切暗藏的反革命分子和各种犯罪分子，严密防止特务分子的阴谋破坏。必须在广大职工群众中开展增加生产厉行节约反对浪费的运动，以最节省的方法使用国家投资于发挥作用最大的环节，切实精简机构，提高工作效率。全面贯彻“安全生产”的方针，反对一切忽视安全的思想和做法。必须学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，提高职工的业务水平和技术文化水平。必须动员交通部门全体职工，发挥积极性和创造性，巩固劳动纪律，展开劳动竞赛，不断提高劳动生产率和降低成本，为胜利实现我国第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    马叙伦代表的发言
    我完全拥护“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案”和“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”“一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算”和“中华人民共和国兵役法草案”，并保证为它们的全部实现而坚决奋斗。
    我们的第一个五年计划灿烂地展开了我们国家光明、美丽的远景，具体地指出了我们每一个人民努力的明确方向。这是指导我们行动的纲领，是鼓舞我们前进的动力。它的最大特点就是：根据重工业优先发展的原理规定各部门投资的比例关系；有效地保证了社会主义经济因素的逐步增长和它的领导地位的不断加强。这个计划所规定的建设规模是宏大的，速度是很快的，生产指标是先进的；同时又是实事求是，切合具体情况，是完全必要和可能的。我坚决相信：在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在全国人民一致团结、辛勤努力下，在以苏联为首的兄弟国家和世界和平力量的支援下，我们一定可以完成和超额完成这个伟大的计划。
    但是，我们必须认识，实现五年计划是一桩艰巨的工作。这在目前国内外环境中是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。我们的胜利就是敌人的失败。我们的欢欣鼓舞，就是敌人的胆战心惊。内外敌人是不会甘心于他们的失败的。他们一定要千方百计地来破坏我们的五年计划的实现。最近揭发的胡风反革命事件和各地破获的反革命案件就是证明。因此，当我们为实现第一个五年计划而努力的时候，我们必须充分提高革命警惕性，辨别和揭发一切暗藏的反革命分子，予以坚决的镇压。胡风反革命分子对于革命怀着刻骨仇恨，竟说：“是脓，总要排出”这样的话，我认为我们必须“以其人之道还治其人之身”，我们必须把胡风反革命分子和其他任何暗藏的反革命分子，像排出脓包一样彻底地、干净地排除出去！
    从胡风事件的教训，我更深刻地体会到毛主席说过的几句话的重大意义，毛主席说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实现工业化的重要条件之一”。胡风分子的反革命活动，曾经利用了若干知识分子思想上的弱点和毛病，达到其部分的罪恶目的。因此，对于我们来说，提高革命警惕性显然包含着两重意义，一方面要学会政治嗅觉灵敏，善于辨别任何暗藏的反革命分子；一方面要自己警惕自己，检点自己的一言一行，一举一动，有没有给反革命分子以可乘的机会。尤其是我们从旧社会生长的知识分子，应该不讳言思想上存在着很多毛病和严重忽视政治的倾向，这些毛病，常常会不自觉地和社会主义思想发生抵触，如果我们不随时警惕，努力改造自己，那就会对第一个五年计划的实现起阻碍和消极的作用，从而使我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业受到损害。事实证明，敌人正是随时随地想从这方面来钻空子的。我们如果不严肃正视这一点，那正中敌人之计，有使我们自己堕入泥坑的危险。不利社会主义的思想行为是敌人喜欢的事。敌人喜欢的事，我们一定坚决不干！
    我国老话说：“姑息适足以养奸，养疽适足以贻患。”我在这里引用这话有两层意思，一层意思是说对任何反革命分子必须严厉镇压，万万姑息不得，否则对敌人仁慈，就是对人民残酷。还有一层意思，就是我们必须认真努力进行自我改造，对于自己思想上的错误和毛病，应该勇于不断检点和改正，万万留恋不得，否则就难免为亲者所痛，仇者所快。毛主席在“论联合政府”中曾经教导我们：
  “无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”毛主席这段话深深地感动着我。共产党人崇高的品质，应该是我们每一个人努力学习的方向。我虽然还在病中，但看到祖国正在导向无限壮丽、无限广阔的前景，我的心情从来没有像现在这样的愉快和兴奋，我一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，和我所联系的群众一道努力学习，提高警惕，加强团结，为巩固人民民主统一战线，为祖国伟大的社会主义事业而献出一切力量。
    江雪山代表的发言
    我们从李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”中，看到了正在展开和即将展开的轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设，看到了伟大祖国的富强、幸福的远景，因而得到很大的鼓舞。同时，我们也知道，这样巨大规模的经济建设，是在帝国主义包围的条件下进行的，敌人非常仇视我们的社会主义建设事业。我是军人，在听了这些报告以后，深深感觉到我们对于保卫祖国人民的和平劳动所担负的义务是无尚光荣的，所担负的任务是十分重大的。
    现在，中国人民解放军正在向现代化的方向前进。义务兵役制的实施，是现代化国防军建设的重要措施之一。我们衷心拥护彭德怀副总理兼国防部长“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”。
    在一九五四年度按照义务兵役制的原则进行的试征中，义务兵役制度的优越性已经很明显地表现出来了。例如由于义务兵役制实施，可以减少常备军，节省军费开支；军队的其他各项正规制度可以顺利实行；军官将以军队工作为长期的甚至终身的职业；兵士的服役、待遇、婚姻、家庭等一系列的问题将逐步得到合理的解决，所以军官和兵士都是热烈拥护的。复员人员表示：“回家努力参加生产建设，支援解放台湾，并准备随时响应祖国的征召”。继续服役的老战士表示：“保证带好新兵，担当起解放台湾、保卫祖国的光荣任务”；在新战士来到部队以后，他们能够以自己的模范行动做榜样，主动团结和教育新战士，从各方面照顾和关怀新战士，他们说：“我们一定要将保卫祖国的本领全部教会新战士”。去年应征入伍的新战士表示：应征服兵役是公民应尽的光荣义务，是保卫祖国社会主义建设和解放台湾的实际行动；所以入伍后情绪高涨，要求进步，在军官的教育和老战士的帮助下，很快习惯了部队生活，在今年上半年的军事学习中，都有了明显的进步。在连队中，新老战士互相团结友爱，充满着朝气。义务兵役制实施后，今后每年将有大批青年应征入伍，要把他们培养成为有高度政治觉悟的熟悉军事技术的祖国保卫者，要依靠军官细致、耐心地对他们进行严格的教育和训练，因此，军官的责任是加重了。我们每一个军官都要努力学习，提高自己，以便更好地去教育和训练部队。我们一定要使每一个应征来到中国人民解放军这样一个大学校里的青年，在部队里成为一个英勇的战士；在将来服役期满复员回乡时，成为生产战线的坚强的骨干。
    我所在的部队，守备在祖国的国防前线。我们听到的祖国建设上的每一个成就，都给我们很大的鼓舞。战士们喜欢把祖国比喻为一座美丽的大花园，把自己比喻为看门人。大家感到做祖国大花园的看门人，是无尚光荣的。我们喜爱和平，我们从来就没有而且永远也不会有侵略别国的打算，但是我们也决不允许任何侵略者来闯进我们祖国的大花园，破坏我们的和平劳动。我们时刻都在警惕着，毫不麻痹大意，我们热烈拥护迅速实行义务兵役制，壮大国防力量，不放松一分一秒的时间来加紧军事训练和政治学习，提高自己的军事技术、战术和思想水平，坚决为解放我们自己的领土台湾而斗争，为保卫我国的独立和世界的和平而斗争。
    鲍尔汉代表的发言
    听了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告、彭德怀副总理关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告、邓子恢副总理关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告和彭真副委员长兼秘书长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我认为这些报告完全体现了全国人民的利益和要求。因此，我对以上五个报告表示完全拥护，并愿为其彻底实现而努力。
    新疆的十三个民族，解放前在一小撮反动统治阶级的血腥统治下，长期遭受着剥削和压迫，各民族之间充满了猜忌、仇视，历史上造成了许多次的民族惨杀，因而在经济和文化等方面遭受到严重的破坏，以致长期处于落后的状态。但处于这种压迫之下的各族人民，团结起来对反动统治者进行了坚决的斗争，终于在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下获得了解放。
    解放后党中央和中央人民政府大力贯彻了党和毛泽东主席的民族政策，各族人民得到了在政治上平等的权利，民族关系已根本改变，各民族人民已经亲密地团结起来了。在民族团结的基础上，我们进行了镇压反革命、改革土地制度、抗美援朝、
  “三反”“五反”等工作，提高了各族人民的政治觉悟和积极性，发展了各项生产事业和文化教育事业。农产品比一九四九年增加了百分之六十五点四；牧畜增加了百分之四十五，畜产品价格比解放前提高了百分之六十四。如：一九四九年用一百七十公斤羊毛换回一匹细布，一九五二年用二十九公斤羊毛就可换回白细布一匹。水利增加了百分之一百三十；各种工业产品增加了三十六倍，布匹销售量比解放前增加了六点九倍。六年来在本省培养出民族干部三万四千名，小学学生增加了百分之七十六点二，中学学生增加了三倍，高等学校学生增加三倍，全省现有医院、诊所及其他防治机构一百三十七处，病床设备比一九五○年增加了一倍。解放前饥寒交迫的劳动人民，今天已能穿到细布衣料，并能吃到油、肉、糖。例如一九五○年一千二百吨糖未能销售完，而一九五四年四千○六十四吨糖还不够供应。
    这些成就都是在中央人民政府、党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，中国人民解放军驻新疆部队在生产建设中忘我劳动精神的示范、鼓励并对各族人民亲切的兄弟般的帮助下和各族人民的努力下，以及友邦苏联像帮助我们全国各地一样无私的帮助之下获得的。由于以上成就，这就给新疆地区推行民族区域自治创造了有力条件。截至目前止，全省已建立自治州五个、自治县六个，今年秋季将成立全省性的“新疆维吾尔自治区”。在已建立起民族自治机关的地区，实现了各少数民族当家作主的权利，进一步表现出欣欣向荣的新气象。主要表现在：
    1、进一步加强民族团结。实行民族区域自治的民族，他们都仿效汉、维族照顾帮助其他民族的榜样，主动地团结和帮助区内各兄弟民族。同样地，自治区内的各民族也更加亲密了。如察布查尔锡伯族自治县过去锡伯族捕蝗时，哈萨克族都不愿参加，并说：“农田都是锡伯族的，我们是牧民，这与我们无关”。但自治县成立后，六区有三百多哈萨克族男女牧民自动帮助捕蝗，并对锡伯族说：
  “捕蝗不只是你们的事，我们也有责任”。七区哈萨克族牧民抽出五百多人，帮助锡伯族农民收割打场。
    2、增强各少数民族人民“当家作主”的积极性。各自治州、自治县成立后，各族人民生产互助的积极性普遍提高。如在克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州，牲畜一九五四年比一九五三年增加了百分之二十一点四，全州幼畜成活率达百分之九十八，为历史上空前最高的一年。
    3、密切政府与人民的联系。自治县成立后，大量的少数民族中的积极分子及同人民群众有联系的领袖人物，参加了自治机关的工作，有许多并担任了领导工作。在十一个自治州和自治县的二百六十六个政府委员中，本地民族占百分之八十四点六，三十四个州长、县长中，少数民族占百分之七十六点六。各自治机关执行职务时，均使用本民族语言文字。锡伯族人感动的说：“反动统治时期，我们连本民族的话也不敢说，如今共产党提倡我们的语言文字，帮助我们发展，民族区域自治真是一个好政策。”
    4、增强了各族人民爱国主义精神。各少数民族经过区域自治后，积极响应支援祖国社会主义工业化伟大事业和解放我国领土台湾的号召。他们深刻认识到共产党和毛主席是少数民族的救星和幸福生活的创造者，对党和毛主席怀有无限的信任和衷心爱戴。他们说：“共产党、毛主席把各民族像自己儿女一样看待，只有共产党和毛主席，我们少数民族才有当家作主的权利。今后也只有在共产党和毛主席领导下，才能走向繁荣和幸福。”
    以上事例充分说明共产党和毛泽东主席民族政策的伟大和正确性。但是不能否认，在实行民族区域自治筹备工作中是有许多缺点的。关于民族自治意义的宣传教育工作做的不够深入，致有少数人对实行民族区域自治的优越性认识不足。例如有人说：“在党和人民政府的领导下，各民族既然有平等权利，现在又有什么必要实行区域自治呢？”
      根据上述情况，在“新疆维吾尔自治区”成立后，必须进一步加强爱国主义与国际主义的宣传教育工作，继续巩固与发展各民族之间兄弟般的友谊，在中共中央、毛主席和国务院的领导下，在伟大的汉族人民兄弟般的帮助下，大力发展自治区的经济和文化事业，逐渐消除历史上遗留下来的事实上的不平等。
    在全国各族人民努力于伟大祖国社会主义建设之际，反革命分子到处进行破坏活动，企图颠覆人民政权。为了保卫人民革命的胜利成果，我们建议要坚决地和彻底地消灭胡风反革命集团和混进革命阵营中的一切反革命分子，并予严厉镇压。同时，各族人民要提高警惕，随时揭露反革命分子的破坏活动，使我们祖国的建设事业胜利前进。
    在“新疆维吾尔自治区”成立后，为了保证各族人民都能真正行使自治权利，我们将依照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点，制定自治区内各项单行条例。但这是一项新的工作，我们经验不足，请求中央和有关部门多加帮助和指导。
    最后我深信，新疆各族人民在中共中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，他们将信心百倍地同全国人民一道，为解放我国领土台湾、为胜利完成第一个五年计划和社会主义建设、为保卫亚洲和世界和平而努力奋斗。
    林巧稚代表的发言
    首先，我表示完全同意李富春副总理的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。我是一个医生，在一开始我曾为一时不明白计划内容的相互关系和那些惊人的数字的意义而感到很难提出意见，但是经过了一个多星期以来的小组阅读、专人解释和讨论，我们逐项地研究了第一个五年计划草案的全部内容，获得了不少知识，弄清了不少问题。现在，我认为这个五年计划草案从头到尾是贯穿着国家在过渡时期的总任务的精神和原则的，是科学的计划，是正确而伟大的计划。譬如，从国家投资的比重和各种工业生产能力的增长数字，可以显明地看出了建立社会主义工业化的初步基础，在全部国民经济中占着主要的、中心的地位。在另一方面，我们也可以看出，在五年的过程中对农业和手工业，对资本主义工商业的改造所规定的目标也是非常明确的。所以，我完全拥护这个计划，并要坚决地为其实现而奋斗。
    五年计划的实现，意味着我们社会生产力的迅速的发展，多少大工厂、农业生产合作社正在陆续地建立和组织起来。我们医务工作者应该担负些什么任务呢？我想就这个问题发表些自己的意见。
    总的说来，我认为我们医药卫生工作一直是落后于需要的，而在五年计划的逐步实现的进程中，这种和经济发展速度及日益增长的需要的不相称的情况，是会越来越明显的。因此，我们的任务就是要为克服这种落后的情况进行斗争，赶快地跟上去。
    第一，现代工业的发展，就要求我们有现代的工业卫生的科学和工作，如在各种工厂的保健工作，职业病的防预和治疗工作等。这些都是专门的学问，而我们目前在这方面是远远落后于需要的，既有的一些力量也是非常薄弱或是很小的。现在，在地方医学院里，面向厂矿的方针是明确的，这是很好的。今后，必须大力进行的，是如何具体实现这个方针。我认为，有必要再一次强调努力学习苏联先进经验，因为我们在这方面的知识是很缺乏的，不是这样我们就不能迎头赶上。
    其次，厂矿单位的卫生宣传工作必须重视并应积极加强。我在这次会议前的视察工作中，看到工厂的卫生条件的改善，是有了一定的成绩，这是需要巩固的。但也发现有的工厂对工人的健康的重视还不够，工人应有的卫生常识也很缺乏，如北京的一个印刷厂，虽然有在烧焊时用的眼镜罩、衣裙、手套的保护设备，但都放在一旁不用，也没有引起领导上的注意。此外，在工厂里，夜班问题也迫切需要研究解决。这说明在工厂里，对机器要爱护是很明确的，已有了一套办法，但对更宝贵的生产力——工人的健康的关怀和重视是不够的，也还缺乏一套办法的。因此我们除了必须要求各级工业部门或单位的领导重视这问题外，还必须大力在工人中展开卫生宣传工作，利用各种方式，如教育影片等形象化的方法，强调地说明爱护自己健康，就是保证生产的重要前提。
    第三，五年计划草案中规定病床数字将增加百分之七十七点二，医师人数将增加百分之七十四点三，这个任务一定要完成而且是可能完成的。在计划草案中提出的在培养干部方面的“着重提高质量，同时兼顾数量”的原则，我认为是非常正确的。目前，因为迫切需要的缘故，有的把刚从医学院毕业的学生即派出独立地担任超过他工作能力的任务，这样的医生由于缺乏经验和指导，常常解决了小问题而出了大问题，这是很危险的事，今后希望首先要考虑工作的需要、任务的大小来分配干部。以纠正单从满足编制上数字出发而不保证质量的缺点。
    第四，要有领导地大力开展医学科学研究工作，这是和提高干部的工作质量密切相关的。过去，科学家们作研究工作常常是从个人兴趣出发，有的是看自己单位条件，能作些什么就作些什么；从国家社会的需要出发来发挥集体力量开展研究工作是很不够的，学习和研究祖国医学还只不过刚刚开始，因此我的意见，卫生部今后应该加强对研究工作的统一领导，从普遍提高质量的要求上开展研究工作，从保证生产的最需要解决的问题和从发扬祖国医学精华出发开展研究工作，中西医团结起来，共同进行研究工作，在研究工作中应该强调组织性和集体主义精神，把全国医务工作者紧紧地团结起来，出色地作好保证胜利完成伟大五年计划的光荣任务。
    林文彪代表的发言
    李富春副总理的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”与李先念副总理的“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”，我完全同意与拥护的。这两个报告中，提出发展我国社会主义工业化，要从我们自己增产节约，反对浪费，积累资金来着手，列举各种方针与办法都是正确的。我是一个科学技术工作者，环绕这几个办法与方针，提出几项科学技术的改进办法，以符合政府用增产节约，反对浪费来积累资金之号召：
    （1）如何合理地使用国家资源；
    （2）如何改进生产技术，提高质量与数量。
    现在提出几个切实可办到的具体事实来谈问题。在第一个问题上提出
    （一）沈阳有一座高烟囱，所出之气体系焙烧硫化金属所生的二氧化硫，因有碍生物，需要高高地从烟囱引入大气。二氧化硫是制造硫酸的原料，我国使用大量硫酸的硫酸錏肥田料厂，其硫酸原料以前系以高价采购外国硫黄。同一制造硫酸之原料，一方面在冶炼厂将二氧化硫作为废气引入大气里去，另一方面在硫酸錏厂则以高价求硫黄原料。从整体工业化来看问题，这是不合理地使用国家资源。收回烟囱废气，以二氧化硫作为硫酸原料，乃是早已成功的生产工程，既能利用为原料，又可消除危害附近生物。沈阳这根高烟囱每年放掉大量的二氧化硫损失实为浩大。全国很多冶炼厂将大量二氧化硫放入大气，其数更大了。
      （二）我国有很多超级瓦斯煤矿，瓦斯（即沼气）可利用为炭黑原料。炭黑在橡胶工业，尤其在制造轮胎方面是一种不可缺少的补强剂，能提高橡胶物理性能，增加轮胎使用寿命。以前沼气在煤矿是一种危害气体，现在变为一种国防物资。我国现能生产炭黑，但数量与质量远不及国家所需要。我们有大量制炭黑的原料，并有制炭黑初步成就的技术，况且制炭黑的设备投资不大，我们完全有条件扩大生产和提高质量。
    在第二问题提出：
    （一）香茅草为禾本植物。用以提炼制造香料用的香茅油，含油率为百分之二·二，今年华南垦植高种植面积为二万亩，每亩平均产草三千斤，但出油率很低，本年平均每百斤草得油十四两，即草的百分之○·八七五。出油率低主要是由于加工提炼技术不好，大量的油都损失掉。蒸馏出的凝结水中含有大量的油即将其废弃。冷却制度，设备装置，炉灶构造，曝晒香茅草，都是不合理的，致使损失油分与蒸馏时间增长。改进上述种种缺点并循环使用蒸馏出的凝结水，除了能提高锅的生产能力并减低成本以外，能大大地提高出油率，出油率可能达到草的百分之二，即每百斤草出两斤油，这样本年可多得油六十七万五千斤，以每斤六元计合人民币四百零五万元。明年种植面积增为五万亩，则可得油一百六十八万七千五百斤，合人民币一千零十二万五千元。
    （二）我国华南种植的橡胶树所产橡胶的质量应与南洋的橡胶相同，但现在华南所产的橡胶质量很次，这主要是由于在加工过程中破坏了橡胶的质量。质量低的橡胶不能用来制造高级橡胶制品，对国家的损失是很大的。加工过程中存在的问题，主要对橡胶化学方面的知识缺乏认识，操作方法不对，所以改进加工技术不需很大地改变设备和增加投资。
    （三）改进汽车轮胎工业的生产技术以提高汽车轮胎的行驶里程，是有很大意义的。轮胎行驶里程提高，即可少用轮胎，可替国家节约大量资金，应由橡胶工业部门负责进行。
    科学技术之改进，对“增产节约，反对浪费，积累资金”起着很大的作用。每个行业都有其缺点弱点，各生产部门互相联系，交换经验，使得各行各业都从技术革新来提高生产与质量。每个技术生产工作者包括工人、技术员、工程师同在一生产战线上努力争取钻研科学技术之改进，促进第一个五年计划早日胜利完成。
    章乃器部长的发言
    陈云副总理所作的关于粮食问题的发言说明了粮食统购统销政策的完全正确；它是我国现实合理分配粮食的最好的办法，是唯一走得通的道路。各位代表视察归来的报道，也都证明了这一真理。
    我现在就粮食业务工作方面作一些补充。
    粮食业务工作包括接受入库、保管、加工、调运、供应、基本建设等环节。粮食系统中大多数的工作人员是努力的，大多数的单位是有成绩的；缺点主要在于我们中间还有许多人思想上存在着保守性和片面性，工作上存在着老一套的“单打一”作风，往往抓住了一头丢了另一头，顾到一面忽略了另一面，缺乏全面增产节约、全面完成计划的思想，特别表现在经济核算观点薄弱，单纯赶任务，忽视财务成本工作。
    粮食工作每年仍然要赔相当多的钱，但粮食工作中增产节约的潜在力是很大的。今后只要做好工作，结合价格的逐步合理调整，是可以在二、三年之内做到由少赔而不赔的。严重的问题在于一九五四年的费用水平不是比一九五三年降低，而是提高了，今年第一季度的费用水平比一九五四年同期还要高。当然，客观原因是存在的，主要的是去年的大水灾，今年三、四月间粮食供应的紧张局势和许多地方前年、去年入库粮食质量差等等。但，主观努力不够是很重要的。
    费用当中最大的支出是运费和装卸搬运费，几乎占了一半。所以，当我们为了支援灾区和供应紧张的地点调运粮食很多的时候，费用水平马上就提高。去年的灾区都是历史上粮食调出地区，粮价自然低一些，我们要从运输困难的山区多收购一些粮食支援灾区，要从辽远的东北、内蒙、西南各地运粮支援灾区，有些受灾省要吃到十多个以至二十个省调来的粮食，这在运费上和价格上赔钱的数字都是很大的。这的确是只有共产党领导之下的人民政府才能做得到的。我们应该把这一笔赔钱数字统计起来，使得国家救灾支出的数目能够达到全面、正确。支援技术作物区的情况也差不多，如河北省，就要吃到二十多个省的粮食。这些粮食赔钱也很大。此外，由于虚假叫喊缺粮所造成的紧张局势，往往不仅造成粮食运输上的浪费，而且还要打乱粮食部门以至交通运输部门的计划。
    粮食的运输量很大。去年总的运输量要比销售量大一半，有些县要比销售量大二倍以上。大约有半数以上的运费是在县以下的运输上花掉的。这一面是由于愈到下层人力运输比重愈大，因而运费愈贵，另一面也可以看出从接收入库开始就加强运输的计划性是很重要的。
    我们粮食工作人员为了运粮救灾、运粮稳定市场，完成任务的劲头是很大的，这是好的；缺点就是有许多人忽视财务成本工作。如上所说，粮食工作在许多地方有时是只能不惜赔钱的。问题在于有许多人把“不惜赔钱”理解为“不计成本”了。他们没有体会到：赔钱也是要计算成本的；一计算成本，就可以不赔那些不应该赔的钱了。
    我们相信，今年只要能够贯彻“三定”政策，摸清楚农村的缺粮户和缺粮数字，把供应农村的粮食就地留下来，那就可以大大减低运输量，也就大大有助于费用水平的降低。
    节省运费的根本措施，是在提高粮食工作的计划性和实行统购统销工作制度化的基础上，积极推行分区产销平衡合理运输。这就必须继续提倡“有啥吃啥”，以利于分区产销平衡。五年计划要求原来粮食不能自给的省逐步做到粮食自给，更为重要。逐步增建仓库的铁路专用线和逐步将包装运输改为散装运输，也是可以大量节约装卸搬运费和包装费的。
    保管费的开支也是大的，占费用支出的十分之一。保管工作由于各级党政的重视，工作是有成绩的。从去年开始推广无虫仓和无霉仓，今年发展为无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故的四无仓。今年春天进行了一次普查，据二十七个省市统计，在被检查的粮食中，无虫粮已占百分之六十八点五。毫无疑义，在这一个进步的百分比后面，还掩盖着不少的落后仓库。假如说，还有百分之几的落后仓库吧，那就是几千个。有些仓库的负责人们对于虫霉损害熟视无睹，认为这是自然法则，对于鼠雀成群漠不关心，认为吃不了多少。这种人如果不赶快改正错误，是不能不受到国家的惩处的。此外，为了争取无虫、无霉便不惜浪费开支的偏向，虽然已经严加批判，也可能还残存着的。
    保管费的支出，以临时雇用人员的工资和保管用品为最大。由于保管工作季节性大，临时雇用人员是必需的；问题在于许多地方对于人数没有控制，雇用期间过长甚至长期留养。粮食保管干部一般是具有吃苦耐劳的优良作风的，但，近年不少地方由于雇用临时人员太滥，有一些干部已经沾染了轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级的习气。他们自己只管发号施令、做记录、签署，把较繁重的体力劳动支配给临时人员去做。保管用品的积压和浪费，也相当普遍。
    粮食仓库必须推行定额管理。今年必须在有条件的单位推行黑龙江海伦粮栈的先进经验，要求条件较好的地区因地制宜地制定定额试行，在一般地区则先实行预决算控制。
    保管、运输、销售等三个环节必须贯彻责任制，降低粮食的损耗。由于粮食经营数量很大，每个环节只要增加损耗万分之一，就要浪费粮食几千万斤；百分比很小，绝对数字就大得惊人。这也就是说，节约的潜力是很大的。
    加工方面已经基本上扭转了米面过度精白的偏向，成品率提高了不少，从而也提高了营养价值；但，增产的潜力还是很大的。湖南省采用了苏联专家克留契可夫的建议，将广式碾米机由一机出米改为双机出米，每百斤稻谷碾制出口规格的大米可以提高三斤到五斤；沈阳市推行了“分大小粒加工”的先进方法，每百斤高粱出米由七十点四三斤提高到七十四点五八斤；华北进行了面粉厂的厂际竞赛，小麦的出粉率提高了百分之一到二——这些都是具体的证明。
    加工方面的节约潜力也很大。去年委托加工费的支出近四亿元，内中有很多不合理的因素。如：全国面粉加工费率最低与最高的比例，是一比七；加工厂的利润率，除了一些由于设厂地点不合理从而生产能力利用率很低的城市以外，一般为百分之三十多，有的甚至高到百分之四十多。华北举行厂际竞赛后，不少面粉厂每袋面粉的加工成本降低到二角二分，最低达到一角九分几，但加工费的支出一般为每袋四角七分。由于利润大，由于资本主义经营思想作祟，片面追求增加生产量而不顾成品率的偏向仍然在不少的加工厂中继续存在；从这些加工厂的领导人们看来，浪费一些粮食是满不在乎的。有的注意到提高成品率了，但又忽略了保持纯洁度，以致米中含砂含稗，面粉有牙尘。结果除了有害人民健康以外，在消费上造成浪费，为了一粒砂吐了一口饭；面粉因为销不出去而积压，以至霉坏。
    对于粮食加工工作必须制定各种技术经济定额和各种加工粮的技术标准。今后必须积极努力来完成这一复杂的任务。
    加工工作的任务除了提高成品率之外，还必须注意提高营养价值，使得广大人民可以在节约粮食的同时提高营养，可以抵抗在南方蔓延颇广的脚气病。只要加工、调运、供应三个环节结合得好，经常供应人民以清洁、新鲜和胚芽含量大的大米，同时提倡大米不淘洗下锅，就可以大大节约粮食，同时提高米饭的营养价值。蒸谷米的制作是我国的优良生产文化遗产，它的特点是成品率高、出饭率高、营养价值也高，又利于长期保管；应该总结各地经验结合苏联先进经验加以推广。各地最近涌现出来的各种先进蒸饭、煮饭方法也应该加以推广。
    基本建设工作是有成绩的。仓库每平方公尺的造价由一九五三年的七十一元降低到一九五四年的四十九元，再降低到今年年初的四十五元五角。当时有人说：已经没有节约潜力可挖了，节约到顶了，在中共中央和国务院颁发了七月指示以后，我们经过深入检查，才发现还可以节约百分之十左右，是一个很大的潜力。关键在于，造价高低之差本来很大，仓库每平方公尺低的三十五元，高的达七十元；企业、机关房屋差距更大，低的二十七元，高的达九十七元。有些地区造价较高是存在着客观原因的，但，两地条件大致相同而造价高低悬殊，那就可以肯定造价高就是浪费了。预算上宽打窄用的情况在某些地区也严重地存在着，施工单位（乙方）的利润有高达计划利润的七倍的。此外，仓库虽然普遍缺乏，经常还有半数以上的粮食囤存在露天，但也有些地方仓库建得过多，空着没用。应该说，浪费还是在任何方面都存在着的。
    供应工作问题最多。这是粮食系统各级领导重视统购轻视统销的结果。去年下半年农村统销过松，今年三、四月间许多农村叫喊缺粮；但事实上，当时销量是空前大的。原因是许多地方不深入调查真缺假缺，叫喊便供，喊得越响供得越多，因此不缺的也纷纷喊缺，结果销量愈大，叫喊的声音也愈大。经过农村统销工作的整顿，销量大大减低，叫喊也基本上没有了。这一转变说明了事实真相，同时也给我们以深刻的教训。
    粮食工作的节约任务不仅在于节约资金，更重要的还在于节约粮食。不仅要从内部的各个业务环节中节约粮食，而且还要通过合理供应来节约社会粮食的消费。国务院指示，各地必须在秋粮统购前，把农村中非农业人口的缺粮户摸清楚，登载册籍，提前发给购粮证。在“三定”到户时，购销结合，
  一次划清余缺界限，核定农业人口中缺粮户的供应量，登载册籍，发给购粮证。以后再在每年二、三月间进行一次检查，随时发现新缺粮户随时合理解决。同时，在统购方面，坚决不买“过头粮”，买入“周转粮”也另行登记，另发证明。这样，基层干部就可以心中有数，可以随时辨别叫喊的真假，农村统销工作是可以逐步做好的。
    在过去的一个时期，多数城市供应工作控制偏松，凭证购粮流于形式。因此，销量便逐月上升，粮食浪费和倒流农村的情况甚为严重。五月间各地遵照中共中央和国务院的指示进行整顿，严格按户定量，六月份销量即已恢复正常，比较销量最大月份降低了百分之十七点五。由于粮食消费定量问题很复杂，必须在严格的节约原则下照顾到营养，我们正在拟订一个试行的定量标准，并邀请营养学家参加研究。
    我国人民的吃粮习惯是很不一致的。由于各种粮食收成不稳定，国家掌握的粮食还很难达到品种比例的恰当。又因为粮食品种差价颇大，足以影响消费人的负担，这就增加了品种调度的复杂性。为着减少调度工作的困难，避免不必要的调运亏赔，我们曾经号召“有啥吃啥”，这是完全必要的。但有些地方片面强调“有啥吃啥”，忘记了尽最大努力相对地满足人民需要的一面，因而发生了城市居民要减轻负担而买不到粗粮、城外农民过节拿粗粮换面粉又换不到的矛盾现象，也发生了某一个时期配售粗粮过多、另一个时期配售细粮过多的不合理情况，还发生了不问南北户口一律配售大米几斤的偏向。这些缺点我们都已经尽可能给以纠正。但必须说明，“有啥吃啥”的号召还是必要的，圆满地解决人民对于品种选择的要求在目前还是不可能的。
    我们对于猪食的供应是做了工作的。除了早已指示各地收集加工厂的糠麸以供应饲料外，许多地方还将砻糠磨粉搀入细糠制成统糠供应猪食。同时，我们还供应了不少的粗粮。我们估计，在贯彻
  “三定”政策以后，猪食问题是可以相对缓和的。此外，几年以来，农业部门曾不断提倡以油饼充猪食，由猪产生厩肥以肥田。我国生产各种油饼每年达五百万吨以上，如能广泛宣传推动，将其中充作肥料的部分按条件可能逐步改作饲料，那对于猪食问题的解决是可以起到很大作用的。
    粮食统购统销的价格还存在着很多不合理的因素。第一是购销差价在取消了季节差价的情况下一般偏小，往往在同一地点从购进到销出，国家便须赔钱。第二是城乡差价一般也偏小，甚至在粮产区，有的地方城乡同价，有的甚至乡高城低，赔钱很多。第三是地区差价也有很多不合理现象，从产地运到销地，差价往往不够开支。这种不利局势的形成，一部分是统购统销以前同私商作斗争所必需的，另一部分则是由于我们干部中间的片面群众观点所造成的。我们认为，必须在不影响物价总水平的条件下，逐步加以合理调整，以减少国家不应有的亏赔。
    粮食统购统销工作的制度化是国家的既定方针。两年来的经验积累和“三定”政策的实施，已经为建立制度创造条件。我们正在国务院的领导下草拟一系列的办法，包括册籍证票的管理办法。这些办法的实行将使全党动员的政治工作成果能够在业务工作上加以巩固，从而有利于政治工作的提高和业务工作的改进。
    粮食工作的计划性还很不够。三年来，国家计划和省市计划的准确性是有所提高的，但，许多基层单位的计划准确性还很差，因而计划的基础是很薄弱的。“三定”政策的实行将使计划有了比较可靠的基础，从而可以进一步提高准确性。
    计划性不够的另一表现是计划思想薄弱。我们中间有许多人对于计划的高度严肃性体会不够，对于计划的贯彻不够坚决。如，一年来销售计划许多地方连续突破指标，并未引起严重的注意和深入的检查，以致形成统销前松后紧的不利局面和库存的大量消耗。今后应该作为严重的教训。
    粮食系统的机构设置和人员编制还存在着混乱现象，表现在购销点的设置无计划，行政编制不符合当前工作需要，企业编制没有实行定额管理，和行政编制与企业编制混淆不清。因此，在许多地方往往行政编制不够便在企业编制中找出路，企业编制不够又在临时雇用人员中找出路，形成了机构设置过多，用人太滥，人浮于事；当地其他机关也乘机侵挤粮食机构的编制。但同时，又在不少地方发生了机构分布不够，人员太少、太弱的情况。这固然是由于两年来业务变动太大，确定机构、核实编制和设置定额存在着客观上的困难，但，我们粮食部没有制定一套简易可行的初步控制办法，放任自流，是应该首先负责的。
    由于某些地方用人太滥，雇用临时人员更滥，已经发现了不少组织不纯的单位。反革命分子是丝毫不会放松对于粮食工作的破坏的。他们对于粮食统购统销的破坏是隐蔽为主，有时也猖狂到公开煽动群众；对于粮食仓库、加工厂和购销点的破坏，则是完全隐蔽的。半年多来，粮食仓库的失火、被盗事故增加很多，贪污事件也增加很多，必须引起各级领导的严重注意。我们除了不断指示各级粮食部门提高警惕并重点进行检查以外，还迫切要求地方各级党政进一步加强对粮食部门的政治工作、人事工作和保卫工作的领导，同时加强对群众护仓组织的整顿。我们相信，只要人人积极负责，提高警惕，我们决然可以使反革命分子和坏分子无处容身。
    粮食工作关系着全体人民的生产和生活，只要有百分之几的错误和缺点，就可以使几百万以至几千万人遭受到损失。粮食工作同人民群众的关系真是太密切了。同时粮食工作点多面广，要纠正工作中的错误和缺点，也只有依靠广大人民群众的监督。这次各位代表出发视察，以粮食工作为重点，是一个很好的开端。各位代表反映的问题和意见，都将引起我们高度的重视。我们热烈希望这种视察能够成为经常的制度，更希望由于各位代表的视察掀起全体人民对于粮食工作的关怀、支持和监督，使我们能够逐步克服缺点和错误，做好工作。
    粮食工作的任务是很重大的，它对保证五年计划的完成起着重要的作用。粮食部成立三年以来，在中共中央和国务院的领导之下，粮食工作的政策是完全正确的。业务上的许多缺点和错误，业务工作的进度落后于客观形势的要求，粮食部首先是我应该负责。由于全国粮食情况很复杂，我们对于许多事情都是由了解得不全面、不深入而逐步达到比较全面、深入的，领导工作从而也只能由不明确、不具体而逐步明确、具体起来。但，新的情况在不断发生，新的工作任务和新的工作方法、制度不断提到我们的面前来；如果抓的不紧，即使内行也很快地可以变成外行的。毛主席“重要的问题在善于学习”的指示，我们现在应该体会得更加深刻。“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。我们必须紧紧依靠党的领导和人民群众的监督，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，努力工作，努力学习，坚决完成五年计划所交给我们的光荣伟大的任务。
    廖鲁言部长的发言
    ——为发展农业的生产和实行农业的社会主义改造而努力
    我完全同意中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在，我仅就农业生产、合作化运动和农村情况方面，发表一点意见。
    （一）五年计划草案所规定的粮食、棉花、麻、烟、丝、茶、水果、糖料和油料作物以及牲畜、水产等增产指标，是比较可靠的，是可以完成还可以超过的，应该保证完成，力争超过。同时，这些增产指标也是积极的，不是保守的，要完成这些指标，还必须做很大的努力。由于五年计划的头两年都遇到严重的自然灾害，没有完成农业增产计划，后三年的任务就加重了。特别是今年，计划规定：粮食产量比一九五四年增加二百亿斤，棉花增加四百万担以上，甘蔗增产百分之十六，烤烟增产百分之三十八，等等。任务是艰巨的。保证完成和超额完成今年的计划，对于能不能完成第一个五年的农业发展计划具有重大的意义。如果今年的农业增产指标不能实现，就会增加明年和后年的困难，就会给第一个五年的农业发展计划带来完不成的危险性。所以说，今年是完成第一个五年计划的关键的一年。
    从今年的播种情况看，粮食基本完成了播种计划，棉花略有超过，烟、麻和糖料作物的种植面积没有完成原定的计划，但比去年都有增加。除个别地方发生了范围不大的水旱灾情以外，春苗生长一般良好。当前的任务是加强田间管理，除草、追肥，加强同自然灾害做斗争，提高单位面积产量，力争丰产保收。烟、麻、糖料作物等没有完成播种计划的原因，主要是由于农业部和有些地方的农业部门抓得不紧，一部分农民，存在着愿意多种粮食的心理；我们的政治工作和经济工作做得不够；而有的技术作物的收购价格还不完全合理，对于农民种植技术作物的积极性也是有影响的。
    主要增产粮食和棉花，这是对的；同时也必须按照国家计划增产各种技术作物，繁殖家畜，增加畜产品和水产品。否则，就不能适应工业发展的需要和人民生活增长的需要。在讨论五年计划草案中，许多代表对于保证农业增产的措施，对于增加畜产品和水产品，都提出了许多积极的具体的意见。这充分说明，大家都理解到农业对于发展工业的极端重要性——农业为发展工业提供条件。我们农业工作者和全体农民的任务就是：全面地超额地完成今年的和整个五年的农业增产计划，为实现向社会主义前进的第一个五年计划而奋斗。
      （二）五年计划草案所规定的工业农业投资的比例是否适当呢？可不可以削减工业投资来增加农业投资呢？
    我们认为：工业农业投资的比例是适当的，是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务规定的，也是符合于我国当前农业生产的具体条件的。
    我国农业生产当前的具体条件是什么呢？
    由于我国还是一个工业落后的国家，还不能自己制造农业机器，石油的开采量还很小，所以还不能广泛实行农业机械化。同时，由于工业和技术条件的限制，技术资料的不足，更大规模的水利建设也还不能全面展开。一些应该兴修的较大的水利工程，常常由于技术资料不够，设计做不出来，而一时不能动手。在这样的条件之下，发展农业生产的途径，主要还是依靠互助合作，合理使用劳力，充分利用土地，改进耕作技术，加强抗灾能力，发挥集体生产的优越性，来增加农业生产；在装备方面，还是畜力和新式畜力农具；在水利方面，主要还是打井、修塘和新式水车、抽水机等中小型农田水利；在扩大耕地面积方面，除了各地农民就地开垦小片荒地、兴办少数的国营农场和试办机器开荒以外，也由于农业机器和石油的限制，移民垦种一时还不能大规模地进行。当然，农业生产互助合作组织是需要国家贷款扶助的，但贷款也不宜过多。历来的经验证明，贷款过多，就势必助长互助合作组织的浪费，增加它偿还贷款的困难，影响它生产收入的分配，并且可能促使它脱离群众。推广新式农具和兴修农田水利，固然需要国家支出一部分投资和贷款，但更重要的是做好群众工作，把广大农民的人力和财力发挥起来，单纯靠国家出钱是不能解决问题的。由此可见，农业生产的能否增加和增加多少，并不是简单地由国家的农业投资来决定的，在我国工业还不发达，还不能用现代技术装备来重新装备农业的时候，不适当地大量增加农业投资，是没有好处的。
    五年计划中用来发展农业生产的投资指标，就是根据目前农业的具体情况规定出来的。五年内农林水利的支出总数为六十一亿元，除去非农业性的基本建设投资以外，还有五十五点二亿元，加上军垦费、农村救灾费和农业贷款，国家在五年内用于发展农业生产的支出共八十四亿元。再加上农民自己用于扩大再生产的投资约一百亿元，共一百八十四亿元左右，每亩地平均投资十块钱以上。这个数目是不算小的，是同农业生产目前条件下的需要相适应的。
    同时，还应该看到：有一部分工业支出，例如建设拖拉机工厂、农具工厂、肥料工厂、农药工厂等投资，虽然列在工业投资的项目之内，实际上是完全用于发展农业生产的。而这些工厂又是在钢铁及其他基础工业发展的前提下才能获得发展，所以这些基础工业的投资中有一部分实际上也是为着发展农业生产的。这些重工业建设的投资，虽然不能立即收到增加当前农业生产的效果，然而是为农业生产进一步的更大规模的发展创造条件的。不仅生产生产资料的重工业的一部分是为着发展农业生产的，而且生产消费资料的轻工业主要也是为农民服务的，因为农民占人口的大多数，特别是在土地改革以后，他们需要大量工业品的供应；还有广大的手工业，在满足农具和农民日用品的需要方面占着重要的地位，绝大部分的手工业是为农业生产和农民生活服务的。在人们的经济生活中，在社会的生产发展中，农业是不能离开工业的。那种把农业和工业对立起来，把农业投资从整个经济建设投资中完全孤立起来的看法，显然是不正确的。
    从根本讲来，工业是农业高度发展的基础。我国农业落后的基本根源就在于还不能制造农业机器，而小农经济在农业中还占着优势地位。因为不能制造农业机器，就不能用现代技术来装备农业，就不能大大提高农业生产力；因为小生产的农民分散耕种小块土地，也就不能使用农业机器和现代技术，不能大大发展农业生产。所以改变我国农业落后状态的根本道路，是实行社会主义工业化和实行对小农经济的社会主义改造。拖拉机、抽水机、化学肥料等等，都是靠工业供给的。只有在工业化的基础之上，农业的生产力才能大大提高。如果我们削减工业投资，增加农业投资，其结果就是推迟社会主义工业化。如果把工业化推迟了，难道可以完全采用进口农业机器的办法来开垦几万万亩荒地，来使我国的十几万万亩土地实现机械化么？可以用进口化学肥料来满足施肥的要求么？这显然是不能设想的。所以，削减工业投资，增加农业投资的办法，也就是使我国农业的装备落后的状态继续落后下去，对于发展农业生产而言，这是本末倒置的。推迟社会主义工业化，是违反农民的最大利益的，是违反全体人民的最大利益的，是违反总路线的。因此，我们不能采取削减工业投资的办法来增加农业投资。我们认为，五年计划所规定的工业农业投资的比例是适当的。
    当然，这并不是说，我们不在可能范围内尽量争取农业投资的增加。相反地，最近由于坚决执行了中共中央和国务院关于厉行节约反对浪费的指示，节省出大量的资金，因而就增加了五亿元（还可能更多些）的投资到农林水利方面来，主要用于开荒、移民和水利建设；并且在农业贷款方面已经决定增加贫农合作基金贷款两亿元，还将增加一笔农业生产合作社的基本建设贷款。这并不是削减工业投资来增加农业投资，而是把节省出来的资金的
  一部分增加到工业建设方面，也增加到农业建设方面。
    厉行节约，反对浪费，把各方面可以节省的钱都用来发展生产，这正是社会主义积累的根本原则。从这个方面讲，各级农业部门及其所属的国营农业、牧业、水产企业和事业单位中存在着的浪费现象是十分严重的，是不符合社会主义资金积累的要求的，我们农业部的领导工作是有缺点的，必须检查纠正。
      （三）农业合作化运动是不是搞得不好，损害了农民的生产积极性呢？
    我们认为不是这样。李富春副总理的报告中对于农业合作化运动做了恰当的估计。几年来，农业合作化运动的成绩是很大的，在农村任务十分繁重的条件下，每年都按计划地并且超额地完成了建社任务。到今年春耕以前，全国已经发展到六十七万多个社。中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议已经成为广大农民群众的实际行动。这些农业生产合作社，百分之九十以上是巩固的。从生产上看，去年春耕以前成立起来的十多万个老社，百分之八十是增产的；五十几万个新社中，麦收增产、春苗生长良好的社也占绝大多数。农业生产合作社增产的优越性更广泛地在群众中表现出来了。最近各地整顿农业生产合作社的结果，减少的社数不到百分之五，保持下来的农业生产合作社约有六十五万个，入社的农户有一千五百多万户，约占全国农户总数的百分之十四。这就充分证明：在去冬今春农业生产合作社的大发展中，一般是健康的正常的，只有个别的县和少数县的部分乡村发展得较粗较急，问题较多。有些省县虽然入社农户的比例较大，社数较多，例如山西省入社农户已经占全省农户总数的百分之四十，山东莒南县已经有一千二百三十个社；但是，问题并不多，不能巩固的社极少，这也证明发展是正常的。
    由于农业生产合作社的大发展，也带动互助组有了很大的发展，全国各地参加互助组的农户和参加农业生产合作社的农户加在一起约占全国农户总数的三分之二。贫农和由贫雇农上升的新中农，一般是积极拥护合作化，要求办社；老中农的一部分还在犹疑观望，另一部分已经被吸引到合作化运动方面来。互助合作走社会主义的道路已经成为农村中的主要潮流，现有的这一大批农业生产合作社就是引导广大农民继续向社会主义前进的有力阵地。
    当然，在农业合作化运动的胜利前进中，不是没有缺点的。在一些地方，曾经发生过强迫命令、违反自愿互利政策的错误，或者还存在着经营管理不善、生产组织不好等缺点。我们认为，这是运动胜利前进中所发生的局部的缺点和错误，是难以完全避免的。我们并不隐讳这些缺点和错误，而是公开地批评它，目的是纠正错误，改进缺点，更健康地更有信心地胜利前进。
    必须了解：经过互助合作的道路，逐步过渡到社会主义，不仅是贫农的根本利益，也是中农的根本利益；不仅贫农积极拥护社会主义，中农也是劳动人民，也可以在工人阶级领导之下走向社会主义。因为小生产的农民，只有组织起来，互助合作，走社会主义的道路，才能永远摆脱贫困，大家共同富裕起来。特别是我国的农民，由于人口众多而耕地不足，除了合作起来，合理使用劳力，充分利用土地，发展农林牧相结合的多种经济和副业生产，并进行有组织的开荒移民，扩大耕地面积以外，还有什么别的出路呢！？
    我们必须积极巩固已经建立起来的农业生产合作社，并积极发展新社。解放较晚的地区，农业生产合作社数量较少，必须积极发展。老解放区农业生产合作社并不多的地方也要积极发展，空白乡村更要发展；农业生产合作社数量不少，但运动健康正常的地方也应该继续发展，不要停止不前；至于个别地方，农业生产合作社数量较大，质量不好，问题较多，就应该大力做好现有的社巩固工作，在巩固的基础上再行发展。今后两三年内是农业合作化运动的关键时期，必须在此时期内，为合作化运动打下坚实的基础。
    （四）关于农民生活问题，陈云副总理在二十一日关于粮食问题的发言中，已作了概要的分析。现在我根据许多具体的材料，再来作一些补充的说明。
    由于完成了土地改革，也由于在土地改革完成以后紧接着就开展了互助合作运动，发展了农业生产，农村的阶级状况已经有了根本的改变，农民的生活已经有了显著的提高。除了约占农村人口百分之十左右的原来的地主和富农以外，过去是：中农在农村人口中占百分之二十到三十，贫农和雇农占百分之六十到七十；在一部分土地比较分散的地区，中农占百分之三十到四十，贫农和雇农占百分之五十到六十。现在，在老解放区，贫农只占百分之十到二十，新老中农占百分之七十到八十；在晚解放区，新老中农占百分之六十，贫农占百分之三十。这就是说，在老解放区，原来的贫农中已有四分之三以至五分之四以上上升为新中农；在晚解放区，原来的贫农中也有一半以上上升为新中农了。而且，现有贫农的经济地位，同过去的贫农也有很大的差别。现有的贫农，都有自己的一份土地，耕畜农具等生产资料虽然是不齐全的，但也有相当的一部分，穿衣吃饭以至文化卫生生活也比过去提高很多。所以，可以肯定地说，几年来农民的生活是普遍改善了。
    另一方面，把几笔大账算一算，也可以清楚看出农民的生活是普遍改善的。首先，农民在土地改革中除分得约七万万亩土地以外，还分得大量的牲畜、农具、粮食、房屋等经济果实，这是大家都知道的，不必细讲了。第二，几年以来的农业生产是不断增加的，如果以一九四九年农业和农村副业的总产值作为一百，一九五二年增加到百分之一百四十八点五，一九五三和一九五四两年又较一九五二年有所增加。按一九五二年的农业和农村副业的生产总值四百八十三亿九千万元计算，除去农村中的非农业人口，按农户平均，每户收入约四百五十元，而一九四九年每户收入平均还不到三百元。第三，解放以前，土地改革以前，农民每年要交七百亿斤左右粮食的地租，还要交计算不清的苛捐杂税，现在这些都已经取消了，农民的生产收入全是农民自己的；公粮负担又比较轻，按一九五二年计算，全国公粮总数还占不到当年粮食总产量的百分之十三，折成货币还不到当年农业和农村副业总产值的百分之七。一九五二年以来生产逐年增加，负担却大体固定在一九五二年的水平。第四，由于物价稳定以及国营商业和农村供销合作事业的发展，大大减除了私商对农民的中间剥削。单从取消粮食的季节差价这一件事看，缺粮的农民、经济作物区的农民和牧民、渔民、盐民等每年所得的利益至少合粮食二十亿斤。第五，实行粮食统购统销，是保证全国城乡人民的粮食供应，并不是压低农民的粮食消费水平。按一九五四年计算，全年粮食总产量为三千三百九十亿斤原粮，从公粮和购粮的总数中，减去又回销到农村中去的粮食，实际为五百三十三亿斤商品粮，合原粮六百二十亿斤；征粮和统购以后，留在农民手中的粮食，加上又回销到农村中去的粮食，合计为二千七百七十亿斤原粮，全部农村人口不到五亿，平均每人合五百六十斤原粮，其中的薯类还是按四斤折一斤计算的。按照目前农村的粮食消费水平，这个数目是够用的。难道旧社会的贫农和一般中农连大人带小孩平均每人一年能有这么多的粮食么？显然是没有的。第六，农民的购买力也是逐年提高的，一九五二年乡村居民购买各种商品的货币支出约为一百五十四点二亿元，每人平均三十一点一元；一九五三年为一百八十九点七亿元，每人平均三十七点五元；一九五四年为二百二十点二亿元，每人平均四十二点八元。以上这几笔大账，完全证明农民的生活是逐年改善的。
    当然，目前农民的生活水平，全国人民的生活水平，都还是不高的，虽然比起解放以前改善很多，但比起社会主义的苏联人民的生活水平还差得很远，我国人民的物质文化生活的水平还是低的。中国共产党和毛主席领导中国革命的目的，正是为了不断地普遍地提高全国人民的生活。
    就农民而言，当农民还没有土地，受地主阶级的封建剥削，饥寒交迫的时候，中国共产党和毛主席就领导农民为消灭地主阶级，获得土地而斗争。当地主阶级已被消灭，农民已经取得土地，中国共产党、人民政府和毛主席就大力扶助农民发展农业生产，并积极领导农民走社会主义的道路，避免资本主义的剥削。因为，只有社会主义才是引导农民到幸福生活的康庄大道。建设社会主义是全体人民的最大利益，也是农民的最大利益。为了更美好的幸福的未来，农民必须和全国人民一起艰苦奋斗，建设社会主义。
    正当全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，努力建设社会主义的时候，特别是在今年春天以来的最近这一个时期中，在农村问题上，曾经出现了一些错误的议论。有些人认为农业合作化搞得很不好，粮食工作做得很不好，损害了农民的生产积极性，甚至有人重复所谓“农民生活在九地之下”的谬论，这显然是不符事实的，是完全错误的。抱有这种看法的人，绝大多数是由于看问题的片面性，只见树木，不见森林，只看工作中的局部的缺点和错误，而对于缺点错误的范围和程度缺乏比较分析，对于农业社会主义改造运动的伟大成绩估计不足；但他们的出发点是好的，是希望把事情办好的。我们对于这种人应该听取他们的意见，接受他们的正确的批评，同时说明情况，帮助他们弄清问题，和他们共同努力改进工作。另有极少数的分子，从他们原来的地主资产阶级的立场出发去观察问题，对于成绩方面视而不见，听而不闻，对于缺点和错误方面喜形于色，奔走相告；有人甚至故意歪曲事实，借端攻击，抵抗社会主义；其中还混有一些反革命分子的造谣挑拨，阴谋破坏。全国人民必须驳斥地主阶级分子和某些资产阶级分子的叫嚣，警惕和制止反革命分子的阴谋活动。地主阶级分子和某些资产阶级分子想使农民离开社会主义的道路，想把农民引导到资本主义的企图，一定会像他们过去企图维护封建势力，阻止农民的土地改革一样，遭到农民的抛弃。因为凡是有觉悟的农民都知道资本主义的道路，对广大农民说来，就是贫穷破产的道路。
    六万万中国人民自己动手创造自己的社会主义的幸福生活，是任何力量所阻挡不住的。全体人民一定在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，坚定不移地为实现我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而斗争，信心百倍地向社会主义胜利前进。
    许德珩代表的发言
    我完全同意发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，和李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢几位副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。并建议大会对于这些文件，分别予以批准和通过。
    各位代表：第一个五年计划的提出，是中国历史上空前的一件大事。正如毛主席所说的：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。我们中国是一个有悠久文化的世界大国，但是，近一百多年来，我们落后了，我们曾经在相当长的时期中，被迫处在贫困和落后的停滞状态。落后就是要挨打的，百多年来，我们确实挨够了打，我们挨了帝国主义的打，挨了封建军阀的打，这些一次又一次鲜血淋漓的事实，我想我们大家是永远也忘记不掉的。想想过去，再看看五年计划所揭示的祖国建设的宏大规模和美丽的远景，我们将由一个落后的农业国走向富强的社会主义工业国，我想每一个爱国的人民都是如何的欢欣鼓舞！治理黄河这一伟大的战胜自然的计划，将要使数千年为害最多的黄河给人民以无穷的福利，这只有人民掌握了政权，才能做出这样为子孙万代谋幸福的大事。在这里，我以万分激动的心情，感谢中国共产党和我们敬爱的毛主席。
    各位代表：实现五年计划并不是一件很容易的事情，它的实现过程，必然是顽强的劳动，严格的节约和尖锐的阶级斗争的过程，多次的经验证明，我们的胜利就是敌人的失败，我们所最喜欢的事情也就是敌人所最仇恨的事情，美蒋反动集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子必然要用尽一切卑鄙无耻的手段来破坏我们；潘汉年和胡风反革命集团向共产党和人民猖狂进攻以及残余的反革命分子最近在各地蠢动，就充分证明阶级敌人并没有睡觉，他们是越来越猖獗了。我完全拥护全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准将罪大恶极的反革命分子潘汉年和胡风逮捕审判的正确措施，并要求彻底清查潘汉年和胡风的反革命罪行予以严惩。我并且认为潘汉年事件的被揭露，是中国共产党和全国人民在同反革命分子作斗争中又一次重大的胜利，这一胜利说明中国共产党是英明的、伟大的，只有这样一个为马克思列宁主义所武装起来了的政党，才能永远地保持自己队伍的纯洁性，领导我们进行中国革命事业。全中国人民必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，坚决地同一切暗藏的反革命分子作斗争，为社会主义建设事业贡献一切的力量。
    其次，要胜利地实现五年计划，就必须全面地展开增产节约运动，对一切贪污浪费的行为进行坚决的斗争。我们晓得，贪污浪费行为对于国家，尤其是对于国家建设，也同样是我们最可怕的敌人，李富春和李先念两位副总理在他们的报告中所举出的关于浪费的沉痛事实，真是叫人惊心动魄！各位代表：七百六十六亿四千万元巨大数目的国家建设资金，是我们自己筹集的，得来真是不易。全国人民绝对不能容许把大量的资金用在非生产性的不必要的开支上面，绝对不能容许把学校、办公大楼、职工宿舍建筑得像皇宫和庙宇一样；也绝对不能容许一些机关或企业把巨额的款项用在不必要的豪华奢侈的设备方面。至于贪污盗窃行为对于国家财产所造成的损失，也是惊人的，这一切，在我们国家，都是犯罪的行为，必须予以严厉的惩处。
    最后，还应当指出：要胜利地实现五年计划，就需要大批的忠于祖国、忠于社会主义建设的各方面的专门人才。全国文教科学工作者，为了担负起五年计划中国家所赋予的光荣任务，就必须进一步地进行思想改造工作，提高政治思想水平。毛主席早在一九五一年就曾教导我们：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一”。应该指出，我们这几年来在思想改造工作方面所取得的成绩，是很大的。但目前在我们知识分子当中，还存在着某种程度的个人主义、自由主义、主观主义等资产阶级思想和作风，这种思想和作风如不清除，不但对于国家建设事业不能发挥应有的作用，而且可能被反革命分子所利用，甚至蜕化变质。胡风反革命分子就是钻进我们“肝脏”里来“争取人”、“联络人”的。我们必须通过胡风反革命事件吸取严重的教训，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，掌握辩证唯物主义这一思想武器，继续向资产阶级唯心主义进行坚决的斗争。任何认为马克思列宁主义与自己的学术无关，或只顾业务，忽视政治的思想，都是错误的，有害的，应当改正的。
    各位代表：五年计划是全国人民实行社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的战斗纲领，它经我们这次大会决定后，对于全中国每一个人民，都具有法律的约束力。这个计划从一九五三年起，已经实行了两年多，获得了重大的成绩。在这一个关系着国家命运和我们子孙万代幸福的伟大的计划面前，我们每一个人一定要尽我们最大的力量，保证它的胜利实现和超额完成。我们要爱护国家的财产，如同爱护自己的生命一样。我们要时时刻刻保持高度的警惕和反革命分子作坚决的斗争，我们要老老实实、勤勤恳恳，做好岗位工作，为全部完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
