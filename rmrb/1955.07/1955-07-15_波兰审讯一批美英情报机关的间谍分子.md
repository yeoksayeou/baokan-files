Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 14th: The Polish News Agency reported that the Military Court of the Warsaw Garrison began trying a group of spies from American and British intelligence agencies on July 11th. The ringleader of this group of spies was N. Izekowski.

N. Izekowski received spy training in West Germany and was sent to Poland by British intelligence in August 1954 to organize a spy ring. Later, he collected intelligence for the American intelligence agency. In the latter half of March this year, N. Izekowski was discovered by local residents and arrested while attempting to cross the Polish border illegally to West Germany. During the search, detailed maps of the Novotko Metallurgical Combine in Ostrowiec were found on his person, with particularly important departments marked, the destruction of which could bring the entire enterprise to a standstill.

During the trial on the 13th, the prosecutor specifically pointed out the methods used by the defendants to steal intelligence. The defendants took advantage of people's lack of vigilance, negligence, and talkativeness, thus managing to obtain information from their friends, colleagues, and people they happened to meet. The trial showed that the enemy heavily relies on the talkativeness and negligence of those who, although honest, sometimes forget the class struggle and the enemy's efforts to infiltrate our country.

The prosecutor requested that the ringleader of the entire spy group, the defendant N. Izekowski, and V. Izekowski, who helped organize the spy group and was particularly enthusiastic about this criminal activity, be sentenced to death. He also requested that the other defendants be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for terms ranging from eight to twelve years.

    波兰审讯一批美英情报机关的间谍分子
    新华社华沙十四日电  据波兰通讯社报道：华沙卫戍部队军事法庭七月十一日开始审讯一批美英情报机关的间谍分子，这批间谍的头子是拿·伊泽科夫斯基。
    拿·伊泽科夫斯基曾在西德受间谍训练，在一九五四年八月被英国情报机关派到波兰来组织间谍集团。后来他又为美国情报机关收集情报。在今年三月下半月，当拿·伊泽科夫斯基企图偷越波兰国境前往西德时，被当地居民发现而被捕。在搜查中，发现他身上藏有奥斯特罗维奇地方的诺伏特科冶金联合企业的详图，图上还标明了特别重要的部门，这些部门如遭破坏，就可以使整个企业陷于停顿。
    检察官在十三日的审讯中特别指出了被告们窃取情报的办法。被告利用人们的缺乏警惕、麻痹大意和多嘴哓舌的缺点，于是得以从他们的朋友、同事和他们偶然碰到的人那里获得情报。审讯表明，敌人非常指望利用那些虽然是诚实的、但是有时候忘记了阶级斗争和敌人努力渗入我国的人们的多嘴哓舌和麻痹大意。
    检察官要求判处整个间谍集团的头子被告拿·伊泽科夫斯基和帮助组织间谍集团、并且对这种罪恶活动特别热心的维·伊泽科夫斯基以死刑，要求判处其他各犯以无期徒刑或八年到十二年不等的有期徒刑。
