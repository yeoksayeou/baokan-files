Random Notes on Yellow River Survey
Li E’ding, Engineer of the Hydroelectric Power Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry

At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, Vice Premier Deng Zihui delivered the "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Controlling Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Conservancy," which presented us with a vision of an infinitely bright future for the Yellow River.

In order to fundamentally control and develop the Yellow River, surveying work from the source to the estuary, and in the vast loess region, began shortly after the national liberation. Large-scale topographic surveys, geological explorations, and hydrological data organization were carried out. These diligent efforts provided a certain data foundation for the comprehensive utilization plan of the Yellow River. In early 1954, after the Soviet planning expert group, composed of experts in hydraulic engineering, hydrology, geology, construction, irrigation, navigation, and other fields, arrived in Beijing, they believed that this data was basically sufficient as a basis for writing the report. However, to gain an in-depth understanding of the actual situation of the Yellow River, listen to the opinions and requirements of local comrades on governing the Yellow River, and solve the key issues of the Yellow River's comprehensive utilization, the Yellow River Planning Commission formed an unprecedentedly powerful survey team and set out for the Yellow River shortly after the start of the indoor planning work.

The survey team included Li Baohua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, as well as nine Soviet experts and many Chinese engineers and scientists. As an engineering technician, I was fortunate enough to participate in this survey work.

800 Kilometers Below Mengjin

Although it was early spring, the cold wind on both sides of the Yellow River was still biting, and snowflakes were still fluttering in the sky. The survey team first came to the lower reaches of the Yellow River and began on-site research at the dangerous spots along the river, on Dagudao Island at the Yellow River estuary, and on the banks of the hydrological station's measuring point.

For the 800-kilometer stretch of the Yellow River below Mengjin, long embankments meander along both banks, and the river water, like a muddy yellow water dragon, is constrained between the two embankments. A large amount of sediment has raised the riverbed year by year, making the riverbed between the two embankments higher than the vast land outside the embankments. On the embankments, "dangerous works" built with straw and stones are almost one after another, and alarm bells are set up every few miles.

Many of the "dangerous works" we surveyed were locations where breaches had occurred several times in the past. When we stood on Dongbatou, the old breach of Tongwaxiang in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855), saw the dry old river course and the remaining embankments before the breach changed its course, and looked at the rolling Yellow River flowing in the existing river course, we could hardly imagine that such a torrent would break through the embankment in an instant, make a 90-degree turn, and flow to a completely different road, submerging many farmlands, washing away many houses, and causing many people to lose their lives. At Huayuankou, everyone looked at the deep water pits outside the embankment at the breach site, which had been impacted by the flood and still remain, and remembered the insane act of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who breached the embankment here, using the weakness of the Yellow River itself to massacre the people, and their hearts were filled with indignation. In Jinan, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou, the survey team listened to reports from responsible comrades of local government agencies, which mentioned the many serious disasters caused by the Yellow River in history, and the urgent desire of the people on both sides of the Yellow River to fundamentally solve the Yellow River flood problem and develop the Yellow River.

Along the way, we also clearly saw that the Yellow River's embankments had been greatly improved since liberation. The embankments were widened, raised, and strengthened. Saplings were planted on the embankment slopes. Drilling workers on the embankments were using their own invented cone penetration method to find hidden dangers in the embankment and fill them. Materials for repairing "dangerous works" were piled up like mountains, ready to resist the impact of floods at any time. The 1,500-meter-long Shitou Zhuang flood diversion weir was also built. All this made people feel that it was not accidental that the Yellow River had safely passed several years without breaches since liberation. However, because the problems of sediment and floods have not been resolved, the threat of Yellow River water hazards has not been eliminated, and the lives of the people on both sides of the river cannot be peaceful, especially the more than one million people in the flood storage area need to prepare to move at any time during the flood season every year, and the tense and critical situation of flood prevention every year cannot be lifted.

Along the way, we saw the turbulent and frightening muddy water between the two embankments, and also saw the vast land outside the embankments that could not be irrigated. What we saw and heard made us more clear about how important and urgent it is to completely control the Yellow River floods and develop irrigation, power generation, navigation, and other undertakings on a large scale.

Sanmenxia

After completing the work in the lower reaches, the survey team arrived at the Sanmenxia dam site in extremely excited mood. Here, the solid igneous rocks on both banks and two large rocky islands in the middle of the river created extremely superior topographic and geological conditions for building a dam, and the comrades of the survey team were very happy. The Soviet experts, seeing the long-famous Sanmenxia, praised it continuously, saying that they had finally found a dam site that was needed to eliminate downstream flood disasters and achieve comprehensive utilization by building a huge reservoir.

On the bank where the river was rushing and the water was surging, Chinese engineers shouted to the Soviet experts about the situation of "Ghost Gate," "God Gate," and "Man Gate," introducing the location of the future dam axis and the sequence of construction diversion, and engaging in heated discussions. Old geological expert Ogarin, who was over sixty years old, was the busiest. With extremely vigorous steps and energy, he climbed up and down, constantly hammering the stones with a hand hammer that had followed him for decades and traveled all over the Soviet Union. He meticulously and quickly surveyed the left bank, then the right bank, and carefully inspected the drill cores, enthusiastically explaining to our geological personnel what issues should be paid attention to in future work.

It was dusk on this day when everyone returned to the accommodation, still with infinite excitement in their hearts.

Sanmenxia is an extremely important location, and the development and utilization of Sanmenxia is an extremely important issue. In order to better affirm this issue and reach a consensus, after completing the survey task from Longmen to Mengjin, the survey team held a technical symposium in Xi'an. At the meeting, Chinese engineers and geological experts first expressed their opinions, and then each Soviet expert made an important speech one after another. Hydrological expert Bakhdzhiarov detailed the advantages of the Sanmenxia Reservoir in solving Yellow River floods, sediment, and regulating flow. Geological expert Ogarin said: "The geological conditions of Sanmenxia are very favorable, and the solidity of the diorite porphyry is beyond doubt." Irrigation expert Gorneyev convincingly pointed out the important significance of the Sanmenxia Reservoir for downstream irrigation. Navigation expert Camille believed that the Sanmenxia Reservoir not only created favorable conditions for downstream navigation, but the reservoir itself would also be a good navigable lake. Hydraulic engineering expert Selivanov said: "Building a dam on such a solid rock foundation, its design and construction, from a technical point of view, will not have any difficulties." Construction expert Agolakov said: "Only Sanmenxia can effectively control floods and sediment. The three rocky islands of Sanmenxia create natural favorable conditions for construction diversion; the structure of the buildings is simple, and the amount of concrete is small, all of which are favorable conditions for construction." Finally, the head of the expert group, Korolyov, summarized the speeches of the experts and solemnly stated: "In the lower reaches of the Yellow River, from Longmen to Mangshan, among all the dam sites we have seen, we must admit that the Sanmenxia dam site is the best. No other dam site can replace Sanmenxia and bring such great benefits to the downstream; it cannot comprehensively solve the problems of flood control, irrigation, power generation, and other aspects like Sanmenxia."

This was a historic meeting in solving the Yellow River problem. The Yellow River radiated infinite light in front of everyone present, filling everyone with hope and confidence.

In the Loess Region

Sediment is the fundamental reason for the Yellow River's "prone to siltation, breaches, and migration." Relying on reservoirs can certainly intercept sediment, but a large amount of sediment constantly flows into the reservoir year after year, and the lifespan of any reservoir will be seriously threatened. Moreover, in the loess region of the middle reaches of the Yellow River (the main source of sediment), a large area of topsoil is heavily damaged and washed away, and as a result of years of evolution, it has become a barren area, and the people's lives are mired in poverty. Therefore, soil erosion is unfavorable to the agricultural production and people's lives in the loess region of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and to the lifespan of the downstream reservoir. The survey team successively focused on surveying the Jing River and Wuding River areas, which have the most serious soil erosion, and the desert area near Yulin, and also surveyed the tributary reservoir dam sites that can block sediment and also be used for irrigation.

In the loess region with serious soil erosion, muddy torrents flow in the tributaries of the Yellow River. The mountains on both sides are full of deep gullies and depressions. Many water conservancy engineers and scientific researchers in soil, plants, and meteorology are starting to work hard in these areas, looking for medical secrets to restore the youth of the loess region, burying themselves in the cultivation of seedlings and grass seeds. They have already made certain achievements. We saw several soil dams about 20 meters high built for experiments, protective works on the edges of gullies and steep slopes, various seedlings and grass seedlings being cultivated, and methods for measuring soil erosion. We also walked down to the bottom of the deep gullies to view the "fork willow valley bars" that have their own growth power. It is considered to be the best "valley bar" design in loess gullies lacking stone materials.

Soil and water conservation work must rely on the broad masses of the people. The survey team paid great attention to some simple and easy soil and water conservation methods made by the masses themselves. Soviet experts asked in detail about many small measures created by the masses, such as "water dustpans," "contour ditch banks," and "water cellars." A deep loess gully in front of a farmer's house on Dongzhiyuan in Qingyang Prefecture, Longdong, can maintain for 90 years without continuing to collapse due to proper protection. Along the way, we also saw that in some places, trees were not cut down, and they could maintain a small piece of scenery that was completely different from the surrounding situation, and some places had already achieved obvious results in closing hillsides for afforestation. In Yulin Prefecture, although some counties and villages have abandoned a large amount of steep sloping farmland after carrying out soil and water conservation work, the total harvest has still increased. These concrete facts aroused great interest among everyone and enhanced their confidence in soil and water conservation work. Many soil and water conservation methods created by the masses were further affirmed in this survey, enriching the content of the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan.

From Liujiaxia to Hukou Waterfall

The survey team traveled from Xi'an through the Jing River Basin to Lanzhou. The name of the magnificent and precipitous Liujiaxia Gorge upstream of Lanzhou was already familiar to the members of the survey team. When the car reached the top of the mountain on the left bank of Liujiaxia via a rugged and narrow temporary road, everyone, with the desire to see it first, let go of their steps and rushed to the gorge. People stood on the edge of the gorge, and the deep and dangerous situation of the gorge was clear at a glance. The river channel, which was already several kilometers wide in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, was here restricted by the towering and solid rock cliffs on both banks to a river channel only forty or fifty meters wide. The fierce rapids rushing in this gorge further showed the huge power contained in the Yellow River. This majestic gorge constitutes an excellent high dam site. Geological experts and construction experts walked down the gorge along a winding and steep path to the river bank to further understand the situation. They opened the drawings on the large stones on the river bank and talked loudly about the construction project that would soon begin here. Finally, everyone crossed the pile of rubble, climbed up the extremely steep slope, and surveyed along the river bank all the way to the exit of the gorge.

Lying on the marching bed in the tent at night, the situation of Liujiaxia Gorge was still tumbling in people's minds. A high and majestic arch dam will be built in the middle of this majestic gorge, and huge tunnels will transport the water of the Yellow River to the power plants on both sides, driving one million kilowatts of water turbine generators to generate powerful electricity.

In the few days in Lanzhou, the Niu Bizi Gorge, Maolong Gorge, and Wujin Gorge were also surveyed. These majestic gorges seemed to welcome the survey team to understand them, striving to rank themselves in the list of tiered development of the Yellow River comprehensive plan, and striving for the priority of serving the people.

Starting from Lanzhou, passing through the semi-desert area, we arrived at Qingtongxia, the gateway to the famous Inner Mongolia grassland. The survey team studied the intakes of the ancient Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tang Xia Canal, and continued to move forward. Along the way, we saw that the soil on both sides of the Yellow River in this area was quite fertile, but due to years of unreasonable irrigation and poor drainage, serious salinization had occurred, and agricultural production was greatly affected. All along the way, we saw patches of silvery-white surface due to salinization, and farmers were investing huge labor to clean up the channels that had been flooded by irrigation. These situations particularly aroused the deep attention of irrigation expert Gorneyev. In a symposium, he pointed out that the main task in this area at present is to repair the channels and lower the groundwater level; it is unfavorable to develop new irrigation before the original canal system has been rectified.

This Hetao Plain has long been known for its richness. Although it is affected by long-term poor drainage and serious salinization, when the upstream reservoir is built and the flow is regulated, and when the canal system is thoroughly repaired, the Hetao Plain will become a more fertile area.

The Yellow River enters the 600-kilometer-long gorge area at Lama Bay in Qingshuihe County, downstream of Baotou. From Lama Bay to Hequ, the survey team traveled by boat. Along the way, the towering limestone cliffs on both banks were clear at a glance. Every time we arrived at a dam site, everyone disembarked for in-depth understanding and to view the drill cores. At night, we disembarked and set up tents by the river to stay overnight.

Although it was already late May, it was still very cold from night until morning. The clear spring water flowing out of the mountain crevices was the place where everyone washed in the morning. There, everyone greeted each other with "Good morning." The cold was driven away by the warm talk and laughter, and new work awaited people again.

Longkou in Hequ County was the last dangerous beach in this voyage and also the most dangerous one. Although the helmsmen were all the most experienced old boatmen in this area, the tortuous and narrow beach road and the rapid currents still caused one boat to run aground on a stone in a place where the currents turned sharply. People who had safely crossed Longkou, led by Vice Minister Li Baohua, waded through water up to their thighs and pulled up two small boats to rescue. When the boat was rescued and sailed safely downstream, people rushed to shake hands with the Soviet experts and other comrades who had come down from the boat. Expert Agolakov shook Vice Minister Li's hand and said in Chinese, "Minister Li, thank you."

After surveying the area with the most serious soil erosion in northern Shaanxi from Taiyuan, the survey team returned to Taiyuan and arrived at Hukou, the only waterfall on the Yellow River, via Linfen. The rolling yellow water fell from a height of 17 meters into a deep and narrow stone trough, with mist rising to the sky and the sound of water like thunder. The Hukou Waterfall shows the huge water power of the Yellow River, but these natural drops are only a small part of the Yellow River's water power resources; extremely large and abundant, water power resources amounting to tens of millions of kilowatts are still hidden in the many gorges of the Yellow River. When huge dams are built in these gorges of the Yellow River, artificial waterfalls several times higher than Hukou will be created in many places on the Yellow River.

Infinitely Bright Future of the Yellow River

The significant Yellow River survey task has been successfully completed. The survey team spent more than 100 days surveying the 3,300-kilometer river channel from Lanzhou to the estuary, surveying 21 dam sites on the main stream, 8 dam sites on tributaries, 8 irrigation areas, 4 soil and water conservation areas, 7 hydrological stations, about 800 kilometers of downstream embankments, and surveying the river channel and navigation conditions along the river. We listened to, discussed, and studied in detail the opinions and requirements of relevant local authorities on governing the Yellow River, and reached a unified consensus on the important key issues in the Yellow River plan, especially the location of the first-phase project, laying a good foundation for the preparation of the Yellow River plan and the subsequent actual development work.

The Yellow River will completely change its current appearance. The people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River will no longer suffer from flood disasters. Tens of millions of acres of farmland in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Hetao area, and the tributaries of the Yellow River will have complete irrigation systems built within a few decades, introducing the clear water of the Yellow River. Large dams and hydropower stations will be built one after another on the Yellow River. Tall power transmission towers will send huge amounts of electricity to factories and cities hundreds of kilometers away. Ships will not only travel in the reservoirs, but will also be able to travel between the upstream and downstream through the ship locks inside the dam body in the future. The loess area with serious soil erosion will be either terraced fields or green hills, and we will no longer see barren mountains and muddy torrents.

The infinitely bright future of the Yellow River is beckoning to us. I was fortunate enough to participate in the Yellow River survey work, and in the future, I must make greater efforts to realize the tasks stipulated in the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan.

    黄河查勘散记
    燃料工业部水力发电建设总局工程师　李鹗鼎
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，邓子恢副总理作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，给我们展现了一幅无限美好的黄河远景。
    为了根治和开发黄河，全国解放不久，就开始了黄河自河源到海口，及广大黄土区的查勘工作，并进行了大规模的地形测量，地质勘探及水文资料的整理工作。这些辛勤的劳动，使综合利用黄河的规划工作有了一定的资料基础。一九五四年年初，由苏联水工、水文、地质、施工、灌溉、航运等各方面的专家组成的苏联规划专家组到达北京后，认为这些资料基本上已够作为编写报告的根据；但为了深入实际了解黄河实况，听取地方上的同志对治理黄河的意见和要求，解决黄河全面综合利用的关键问题，在室内规划工作开始不久后，就由黄河规划委员会组成一个空前强大的查勘团向黄河出发了。
    参加查勘团的有水利部副部长李葆华，燃料工业部副部长刘澜波，还有九位苏联专家和许多中国的工程师、科学工作者。我作为一个工程技术人员，也幸运地参加了这次查勘工作。
    孟津以下八百公里
    那时虽是初春时节，黄河两岸的寒风仍然刺骨，雪花还在天空飘荡。查勘团首先来到黄河下游地区，在沿河的险工地点，在黄河海口的大孤岛上，在水文站测流处的岸边，开始实地研究。
    黄河自孟津以下，八百公里的河道两岸，蜿蜒着漫长的大堤，河水像一条泥黄色的水龙被约束在两堤之间。大量的泥沙逐年淤高了河底，使两堤间的河床高出了堤外广大的土地。大堤上，用秸料石块筑造的“险工”几乎一个接着一个，摆设的警钟每隔几里就有一个。
    我们查勘的许多“险工”都是以往曾经数次决口的地点。当我们站在咸丰五年（一八五五年）铜瓦厢旧决口的东坝头，看到决口改道前枯干的旧河道及残留的堤防，又望见滚滚的黄水奔流在现有的河道之中，真不敢想像这样的巨流会在瞬息之间冲破了大堤，作了九十度的大转弯，流向完全另外的一条道路去，使多少农田被淹没，多少房屋被冲走，多少人丧失了生命。在花园口，大家望着那在决口地点的堤外曾被洪流冲击，至今仍残存着的深水坑，想起蒋匪帮在这里丧心病狂地扒开大堤，利用黄河本身的弱点屠杀人民时，心中愤恨不已。在济南、开封、郑州，查勘团都倾听了当地政府机关负责同志的报告，这些报告都提到黄河在历史上造成的许多严重的灾难，都提到黄河两岸的人民对根本解决黄河水患问题和开发黄河的迫切愿望。
    查勘的沿途也很清楚地看到，解放以来黄河的堤防有了极大的改进。大堤加宽加高加固了。堤坡种植了树苗。大堤上钻探工人正在利用自己创造的锥探法，寻找堤身的隐患，加以填补。修补“险工”的材料堆积如山，时刻准备抵御洪水的冲击。长一千五百公尺的石头庄溢洪堰也修建起来了。这一切都使人感到解放以后黄河能安全地渡过好几年没有决口，并不是偶然的。但是由于泥沙和洪水问题没有解决，黄河水害的威胁并没有消灭，两岸人民的生活仍得不到安宁，尤其是在滞洪区的百多万人民每年泛期时时刻刻需作搬家的准备，每年防泛紧张危急的情况仍不能解除。
    这一路上，我们看到两堤之间汹涌怕人的浊流，也看到堤外得不到灌溉的广大的土地。所见所闻，使我们更加明确了彻底根治黄河水患，大规模地利用黄河发展灌溉、发电、航运等事业是多么重要而迫切的问题。
    三门峡
    结束了下游的工作后，查勘团在极端兴奋的心情下到了三门峡坝址。这里，两岸坚固的火成岩和河中间两个大的岩岛，造成了建造拦河坝极优越的地形、地质条件，查勘团的同志们都十分高兴。苏联专家见到闻名已久的三门峡，更是不断称赞，表示终于满意地找到了为根除下游洪水灾害，达到综合利用目的，而需要建造的巨大蓄水库的拦河坝地点。
    在河水奔腾，水势澎湃的岸边，中国的工程师们扯大嗓子向苏联专家介绍着“鬼门”“神门”“人门”的情况；介绍着未来坝轴线的位置，施工堵流的先后次序，展开了热烈的讨论。六十多岁的老地质专家奥加林是最忙碌的一位，他以极健壮的步伐，极充沛的精力爬上爬下，不断地用曾经跟随他几十年、跑遍了全苏联的手锤敲打着石头，紧张而敏捷地详细查勘了左岸，又查勘了右岸，还详细地验查了钻探的岩心，并热心地向我们的地质人员讲解今后工作中应该注意哪些问题。
    这一天黄昏时分，大家才回到了住宿地点，心中仍有无限的兴奋。
    三门峡是一个极其重要的地点，三门峡的开发利用是一个极其重要的问题。为了很好地肯定这个问题，取得一致的认识，在完成龙门到孟津一段的查勘任务之后，查勘团在西安召开了技术座谈会。会上中国工程师及地质专家们先发表了意见，接着每一位苏联专家都先后作了重要的发言。水文专家巴赫吉阿洛夫详细地伸述三门峡水库对解决黄河洪水、泥沙及调节流量的优越性。地质专家奥加林说：“三门峡的地质条件是非常有利的，闪长斑岩的坚固性是无可怀疑的”。灌溉专家郭尔涅夫令人信服地提出三门峡水库对下游灌溉的重要意义。航运专家卡米利尔表示三门峡水库不但给下游航运造成有利条件，水库本身也将是很好的通航湖泊。水工专家谢利万诺夫说：“在这样坚固岩石基础上修建堤坝，它的设计和施工，从技术上看是不会有什么困难的”。施工专家阿哥拉克夫说：“只有三门峡才能有效地控制洪水和泥沙。三门峡的三个岩岛，给施工导流造成了自然的有利；条件建筑物的结构简单，混凝土数量小，都是施工的有利条件。”最后专家组长柯洛略夫总结了各位专家的发言，郑重地提出：“在黄河下游从龙门到邙山，在我们看过的全部坝址中，必须承认三门峡坝址是最好的一个。任何其他坝址不能代替三门峡，使下游获得那样大的效益；不能像三门峡那样能综合地解决防洪灌溉发电等各方面的问题。”
    这是一次在解决黄河问题中有历史性的会议、黄河在每一个到会的人面前焕发起万丈光芒，使每个人都充满希望和信心。
      在黄土区
      泥沙是造成黄河河道“善淤、善决、善徙”的基本原因。靠水库固然可以拦蓄泥沙，但大量泥沙终年不断地流入水库，任何水库的寿命都要受到严重的威胁。况且，黄河中游黄土区（泥沙来源的主要地区），广大面积的表土被大量破坏冲走，多年演进的结果成了荒凉不毛的地区，人民生活陷于贫困。因此，水土流失，无论对黄河中游黄土区的农业生产和人民生活，无论是对下游水库的寿命都是不利的。查勘团先后有重点地查勘了水土流失最严重的泾河、无定河区域和榆林附近的沙漠地区，并查勘了可以拦阻泥沙并兼及灌溉的支流水库坝址。
    在水土流失严重的黄土区、黄河的支流上，滚流着泥浆似的浊流。两岸的山地尽是深沟陷穴。许多水利工程人员和土壤、植物、气象方面的科学研究人员正开始在这些区域上辛勤地进行试验工作，找寻使黄土区恢复青春的医疗秘方，埋首于树苗、草种的培植。他们已经有了一定的成绩。我们看到数座为试验而作的高二十公尺左右的拦淤土坝、看到沟边、陡坡的保护工程，看到各种正在培育的树苗、草苗及测验水土流失的方法，我们更走下深沟沟底，查看了那本身带有生长力的“叉柳谷坊”。认为这是在缺乏石料的黄土沟中最好的一种“谷坊”设计。
    水土保持工作必需依靠广大群众去进行。查勘团对群众自己所作的一些简单易行的水土保持方法予以极大的注意。苏联专家对群众创造的“水簸畚”“等高沟畔”“水窖”等许多小的措施都详细地加以询问。陇东庆阳专区董志塬上一个农民住房前面的黄土深沟，因为保护得宜，沟头沟边竟能保持九十年不继续坍垮。沿途又看到有些地方树木未遭砍伐，就能保持一小块和四周情况完全不同的景色，有些地方进行封山育树也已有了显明效果。在榆林专区，有些县和村进行水土保持工作后，虽然放弃了大量陡坡耕地，但总的收成还是增加了。这些具体事实引起大家很大的兴趣，增强了对水土保持工作的信心。许多群众创造的水土保持方法在这次查勘中进一步被肯定下来，丰富了黄河综合利用规划的内容。
    从刘家峡到壶口瀑布
    查勘团从西安经过泾河流域到了兰州。兰州上游雄伟险峻的刘家峡峡谷的名字早为查勘团的人们所熟悉。当汽车经过崎岖狭窄的临时公路到达刘家峡左岸的山顶时，大家都抱着先睹为快的愿望，放开了步伐奔向峡谷。人们站在峡谷的边缘上，峡谷深险的形势一览无遗。在黄河下游已经熟悉了的宽达数公里的河道，在这里被两岸高耸的坚岩峭壁限制在宽仅四、五十公尺的河道中，凶猛的急流在这峡谷中奔腾，更显出黄河蕴藏着巨大的力量。这雄壮的峡谷构成一个优良的高坝坝址。地质专家同施工专家为深入了解情况更顺着曲陡的小路走下峡谷，直到河边，在河边的大石上打开图纸，大声谈论不久将在这里开始的建设工程。最后，大家穿过乱石丛堆，爬上极陡的山坡，沿着河岸一直查勘到峡谷的出口。
    晚上躺在帐篷中的行军床上，刘家峡峡谷的形势仍在人们的眼前翻腾，一座高巍壮严的拱型坝将建筑在这雄伟的峡谷中间，巨大的隧洞将把黄河的水输送到两侧的发电厂房去，推动一百万瓩的水轮发电机，发出强大的电力。
    在兰州的几天里，还查勘了牛鼻子峡，茅笼峡，乌金峡等峡谷。这些雄伟的峡谷似乎在欢迎查勘团去了解它们，争取将自己排在黄河全面规划梯级开发的名单中，争取为人民服务的优先权。
    从兰州出发，经过半沙漠的地区，到了著名的内蒙古大草原的门口——青铜峡。查勘团对古老的秦渠、汉渠、唐侠渠的进水口作了研究，又继续前进。沿途只见这一带黄河两岸的土壤相当肥沃，但是由于多年不合理的灌溉，排水不畅，引起了严重的碱化，农业生产受到很大影响。一路上见到一片片因碱化而呈银白色的地表，农民正投入巨大的劳动力去清理漫灌淤积的渠道。这些情况特别引起灌溉专家郭尔涅夫深切的注意。在一次座谈会中，他指出目前在这个地区的主要任务，是修整渠道和降低地下水位；在原有渠系没有整理以前，发展新的灌溉是不利的。
    这个河套平原早就有富饶的称誉，今天虽然受到长期排水不畅、严重碱化的影响，但当上游的水库修起，流量得到调节，当渠系加以彻底整修以后，河套平原将成为更富饶的地区。
    黄河在包头下游清水河县的喇嘛湾进入长达六百多公里的峡谷地区。从喇嘛湾到河曲的一段，查勘团是乘船而下的。一路上两岸耸立的石灰岩削壁一目了然。每到一个坝址，大家都下船进行深入的了解，并查看钻探的岩心。晚上就下船在河边支起了帐篷住宿。
    这时虽然已是五月下旬了，入夜以后直到清晨仍很寒冷。山隙中流出的清泉是大家清晨漱洗的地点。在那里，大家互相道着“早安”。寒冷被温暖的谈笑逐走了，新的工作又等待着人们。
    河曲县龙口是这次航行中的最后一个险滩，也是最危险的一个险滩。虽然掌舵的都是这一带最有经验的老梢工，但是曲折狭窄的滩道和急湍的水流，还是使一只船在急流急转的地方搁浅在石头上。已经安全渡过龙口的人们在李葆华副部长率领下，涉过深及大腿的水，拉上二只小船去救援。当那只船被救出来平安航行到下游时，人们争着同跨下船来的苏联专家和其他同志们握手。阿格拉克夫专家握着李副部长的手，特别用中国话说“李部长，谢谢你。”
    查勘团在从太原往陕北查勘了水土流失最严重的地区以后，又折回太原经临汾到达黄河唯一的瀑布壶口。滚滚的黄水从十七公尺的高度跌入深狭的石槽里，雾气冲天，水声如雷。壶口的瀑布表现出黄河巨大的水力，但这一些天然落差只是黄河水力资源的一小部分；极大、极丰富，数达几千万瓩的水力资源还蕴藏在黄河的许多峡谷中。当巨大的拦河坝在黄河的这些峡谷中建造起来以后，在黄河的许多地方将造成比壶口高几倍的人造瀑布。
      无限美好的黄河远景
    意义重大的黄河查勘任务胜利完成了。查勘团以一百多天的时间查勘了从兰州至海口三千三百公里的河道，查勘了干流坝址二十一处，支流坝址八处，灌溉区八处，水土保持区四处，水文站七处，下游堤防约八百公里，并查勘了沿河河道及航运等情况。详细听取并讨论、研究了有关地方对治理黄河的意见和要求，对黄河规划上的重要关键问题，尤其是第一期工程地点问题，取得了统一一致的认识，给黄河规划的编制及以后实际开发工作的进行打下了良好的基础。
    黄河将完全改变现在的面貌。黄河下游的人民将不再受洪水的灾害。黄河下游、河套以及黄河支流几千万亩的田地都将在十几年内修建起完整的灌溉系统，引入黄河的清水。大的拦河坝和水电站将一座接一座在黄河上建立起来。高大的输电线塔将把巨大的电力送到几百公里以外的工厂和城市里去。轮船不但行驶在各水库之中，将来还可以通过坝体内的船闸往来于上下游之间。水土流失严重的黄土区不是梯田就是青山，再也看不见干枯贫瘠的荒山和泥浆样的浊流。
    黄河无限美好的远景在向我们招手。我曾幸运地参加了黄河的查勘工作，今后一定要以更大的努力去实现黄河综合利用规划中所规定的任务。
