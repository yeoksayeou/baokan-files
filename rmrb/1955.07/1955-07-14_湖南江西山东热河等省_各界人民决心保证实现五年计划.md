    (By Our Newspaper) The people from all walks of life in Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Rehe provinces were greatly encouraged after reading the "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" made by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, and they expressed their determination to guarantee the smooth realization of the first Five-Year Plan with practical actions.
    In recent days, the broad masses of people in Hunan Province have been excitedly reading Li Fuchun's report on the first Five-Year Plan. Ye Cailin, a provincial industrial labor model from Hunan Province and director of the forging workshop of the Changsha Machine Tool Factory, who is recovering in the hospital, said excitedly while holding the newspaper containing the report: "After three five-year plans, our country can basically build a socialist society. In order to realize this great ideal, we must practice strict economy and accumulate more funds for the country." Pan Rui, the labor model and director of the No. 1 Warehouse of the Hunan Provincial Company of China Food Company, proposed a guarantee to raise pigs even better and strive to keep the annual mortality rate of live pigs below three in ten thousand. Li Congfu, the president of Hunan Provincial Chinese Medicine Hospital, stated that traditional Chinese and Western medicine should strengthen unity, jointly explore the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine, advance traditional Chinese medicine to the level of modern science, and better serve production and construction.
    People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province have expressed their determination to promote the smooth completion of the first Five-Year Plan with practical actions. Wu Tianfo, an employee of the Jiangxi Machinery Factory, wrote in a letter to the "Jiangxi Daily" that: "Our workers now feel even more the importance of our responsibilities. We must intensify our learning and master technology, give play to our enthusiasm and creativity, accumulate more funds for the country, and ensure the successful completion of the country's first Five-Year Plan." Li Yeli, a famous agricultural labor model in Jiangxi Province and the female director of the Tuoxi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongxin County, who had visited a Soviet collective farm, said excitedly after reading the report on the first Five-Year Plan: "We must work hard to increase grain production to support industrial construction, ensure the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan, and strive to achieve a happy life like Soviet farmers as soon as possible." Public security personnel Xiao Dongzhi and Chen Shixian wrote in a letter to the "Jiangxi Daily": "We must overcome right-leaning paralysis and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries to ensure the victorious realization of the first Five-Year Plan."
    The broad masses of people in Shandong Province have expressed their willingness to contribute their strength to the realization of the first Five-Year Plan. After reading Li Fuchun's report on the first Five-Year Plan, the employees of the joint state-private Jinan Yongyuan Fertilizer Bone Meal Factory plan to increase the production of bone meal by another 130 tons in July. Pan Yinzhang's group in the second shift of the bone meal workshop wants to increase the daily production of bone meal from 85 bags to 95 bags. Qin Hongzhai, the foreman of the gas welding class of the boiler workshop of the Sifang Locomotive Factory in Qingdao and a second-class labor model, has been leading all the workers in his class to complete the plan on a daily basis since entering July. He said: "In the future, we must better learn from the example of the Soviet people, practice strict economy, oppose waste, and work hard to complete the first Five-Year Plan." Yang Xicai, the captain of the Shandong No. 77 fishing vessel of the state-owned Qingdao Aquatic Products Company, said excitedly:
  "The country will complete so many key construction projects in five years, we must work harder to support the country's industrial construction." Guan Tingdong, professor and deputy director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Shandong Institute of Technology, said: "I will do a better job in teaching and improve the quality of teaching, so as to cultivate more talents for the realization of the Five-Year Plan."
    People from all walks of life in Rehe Province have published articles in local newspapers, unanimously expressing their determination to fight for the complete realization of the first Five-Year Plan. Wang Guitang, an industrial labor model of Rehe Province and director of the forging workshop of the Chengde Machinery Repair Factory, said in his article: Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy not only paints a great picture of happiness for our people, but also points out concrete and clear goals for our working class. Our working class must work with the people of the whole country to strive for its full realization. Yu Zhenhe, the chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Rehe Province, expressed unlimited excitement about the figure in the first Five-Year Plan that the total expenditure on economic and cultural construction is equivalent to more than 700 million taels of gold. He wrote in his article: I am over fifty years old, and in the past I only heard that the Manchu Qing government paid hundreds of millions of taels of silver in indemnity to the imperialists, and used the money for building the navy to build its own gardens; I only heard that the Kuomintang put the money they squeezed from the people's hard-earned money into their own pockets, and never heard that they did anything good for the people. And our country uses the people's money for the people, and engages in large-scale construction, which is really another vivid patriotic education for me. Our private industrialists and businessmen must actively accept socialist transformation and work with the people of the whole country to build our great and lovable country.

  山东省广大人民都表示要为第一个五年计划的实现贡献出自己的力量。公私合营济南永源肥田骨粉厂职工读了李富春关于第一个五年计划的报告以后，打算七月份再增产一百三十吨骨粉。骨粉车间二班潘银章小组要由过去日产八十五包骨粉提高到九十五包。青岛市四方机车厂锅炉车间汽焊班工长、二等劳动模范秦鸿宅从进入七月份以来，领导全班工人按日地完成了计划。他说：“今后我们要更好地学习苏联人民的榜样，厉行节约，反对浪费，为完成第一个五年计划而努力。”国营青岛水产公司山东七十七号渔轮船长杨锡财兴奋地说：
