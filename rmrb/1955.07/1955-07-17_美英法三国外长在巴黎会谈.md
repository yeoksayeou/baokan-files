Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 16th: TASS, Paris, July 16th—Dulles, Macmillan, and Pinay began their talks at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 15th to agree on the “common attitude” of the “West” at the upcoming Geneva Conference. Prior to this meeting, experts from the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany held three lengthy meetings. One meeting, held in Washington, studied general security issues; a second meeting, held in Bonn, studied the German question; and a third meeting, held in Paris, summarized the conclusions of the first two meetings.

Newspapers reported that the Paris meeting, which also included representatives from West Germany, was to draft a "general report" for the three foreign ministers and to decide on the West's attitude toward "possible proposals from the Soviet Union."

Dulles, Macmillan, and Pinay studied this report during their meeting. Newspaper commentary indicated that there were divisions among the three Western countries on some important international issues, so the main purpose of the July 15th talks was to reach an agreement on "common action" by Western countries in Geneva.

    美英法三国外长在巴黎会谈
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：杜勒斯、麦克米伦和比内十五日上午在法国外交部开始举行会谈，以商定“西方”在即将举行的日内瓦会议上的“共同态度”。在这次会谈以前，美国、英国、法国和西德的专家们曾举行过三个时间很久的会议。其中在华盛顿举行的一个会议研究了一般的安全问题，在波恩举行的第二个会议研究了德国问题，在巴黎举行的第三个会议归纳了前两个会议的结论。
    报纸报道，也有西德代表参加的巴黎会议是草拟给三国外长们的“总报告”和决定西方对待“苏联的可能提出的建议”的态度的。
    杜勒斯、麦克米伦和比内在会谈中研究了这份报告。报纸的评论表明，西方三国在一些重要的国际问题上存在着分歧，因此七月十五日的会谈的主要目的是要就西方国家在日内瓦的“共同行动”达成协议。
