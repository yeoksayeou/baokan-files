    Strictly Guard Against the Sabotage Activities of Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Learn a Lesson and Strengthen Unity Within the Cooperative
    Editor,
    The management committee and some members of the Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jincheng Village, Lanleng District, our county, studied and discussed the article "More Vicious Than Murder, More Poisonous Than Arson" on the evening of July 5th. Everyone felt extremely indignant at the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze, who disguised themselves as activists and infiltrated the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County to sabotage production and mutual aid cooperation. Everyone unanimously supported the people's government's just verdict on the counter-revolutionary elements.
    During the discussion, everyone realized that the two-faced tactics employed by counter-revolutionary elements were the most cunning and vicious, indeed more vicious than enemies who openly commit murder and arson. Sun Fucai said, "They pretended to be active. When the cooperative was established, some members wavered and wanted to withdraw. These two guys pretended to be enthusiastic about joining. After joining the cooperative, they pretended to obey the leadership and tried to get ahead, becoming accountants and model workers, but secretly carried out sabotage activities." Sun Xuechang said, "Counter-revolutionary elements are truly doing everything possible, leaving no stone unturned. Like when we were sweeping snow, the cooperative director (referring to Li Shunda) was absent due to some business, so he secretly provoked the relationship between the director and the members. We must be vigilant against this conspiracy of counter-revolutionary elements to undermine unity."
    Why were counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze able to infiltrate the cooperative and carry out sabotage? Everyone realized that this was due to the lack of vigilance and political paralysis on the part of the leaders of the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. Cooperative director Sun Xuezhi (a Party member) said, "The main reason is that the Party branch was negligent and careless when the cooperative was established, believing that the counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze had been reformed and made ideological progress. They also behaved actively after joining the cooperative, so they became negligent and careless." Sun Zhixiu, the women's committee member of the cooperative, said, "If we don't distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, it will be easy for the enemy to infiltrate our ranks."
    What lessons should we learn from this study? Everyone believes that we should strengthen political study, improve revolutionary vigilance, and distinguish between ourselves and the enemy at all times; we should strengthen the unity of members and leaders, and strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants. Some members said, "As long as our unity is strong, counter-revolutionary elements will not be able to carry out their conspiracy of provocation." Women's committee member Sun Zhixiu said, "We must always stand firm on our class position, not be negligent, and not allow counter-revolutionary elements to exploit loopholes." Cooperative director Sun Xuezhi said, "This study has opened my eyes; it's as clear as window paper, once you 'poke' it, you understand everything. I never paid attention to these things in the past, thinking that the enemies were all honest and wouldn't dare to say anything. I must be vigilant at all times in the future." Sun Fucai and others said: Just take our village as an example, who can see into anyone's heart? We must be wary of landlords and rich peasants, and we must not think that they are honest and that we can peacefully enter socialist society!

    Overcome Complacency and Safeguard Farm Construction
    Editor,
    After reading the article "More Vicious Than Murder, More Poisonous Than Arson" (published in the People's Daily on June 27), I felt immense anger at the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze in sabotaging the nationally famous Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. At the same time, this incident made me more deeply aware that we cannot relax our revolutionary vigilance for even a moment. We must expose and denounce the enemy's plots and tricks at any time, and severely punish counter-revolutionary criminals.
    I work in the trade union of a state-owned farm and often live with the workers. In the past, I vaguely believed that the workers who participated in the farm's work were the masters of the country, and that we should educate them and rely on them. Therefore, when I heard rumors that were unfavorable to the farm's construction, I did not investigate them in a timely manner. I complacently believed that they were just "strange remarks" made by a few backward workers. In fact, there are still landlords, rich peasants, and people with very complex political backgrounds on our farm. We cannot be complacent in the slightest.
    From the incident of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by national agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, and from the nationwide political struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I must learn a lesson, intensify my study in the future, raise my political consciousness, learn the skills to fight the enemy, resolutely overcome complacency, safeguard farm construction, increase grain production, and support the country's socialist industrial construction.

    Learn the Skills to Fight the Enemy
    Editor,
    I am a staff member of a state agency. After reading the People's Daily communication "More Vicious Than Murder, More Poisonous Than Arson" on June 27 and the editorial "Eliminate Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements and Defend the Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement," I deeply realized that the enemy is ubiquitous. In any work position, in any place, we must strengthen political theory study and improve revolutionary vigilance at all times. The Party has repeatedly taught us that class struggle in the transition period will not only not be eased, but will become more complex and acute. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the exposure of the counter-revolutionary case of Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze sabotaging the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, all show that the enemy hates our great socialist construction cause with gnashing teeth, and the enemy is unwilling to let us live a happy life. The better and faster we build, the more rampant the enemy's sabotage activities will be. Therefore, we must increase our vigilance a hundredfold, work harder to study Marxism-Leninism, study political theory, learn the skills to fight all kinds of enemies, overcome the paralysis of not asking about politics, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

### 严防反革命分子的破坏活动

    严防反革命分子的破坏活动
    吸取教训加强社内的团结编辑同志：
    我县兰棱区金城村第四农业生产合作社的管理委员和部分社员，在七月五日晚间学习并讨论了“比杀人还狠，比放火还毒”那篇文章。大家对反革命分子张来全、张扁则伪装积极，混进平顺县金星农林牧生产合作社，破坏生产、破坏互助合作的罪恶活动，都感到非常愤恨。大家一致拥护人民政府对反革命分子的正义判决。
    在讨论中，大家认识到反革命分子所玩弄的两面手法是最狡猾毒辣的，确实是比公开杀人放火的敌人还要狠毒。孙福才说：“他们假装积极。在成立合作社时，个别社员动摇，要退社，这两个家伙就假装积极要求入社。入社后又装得服从领导，直往上钻，当上了会计和模范，暗中却进行着破坏活动。”孙学昌说：“反革命分子真是千方百计、无孔不钻的。就像扫雪那回吧，社主任（指李顺达）有事没去，他就背地挑拨主任和社员的关系。我们一定要警惕反革命分子这种破坏团结的阴谋。”
    为什么反革命分子张来全、张扁则能够钻进社里进行破坏呢？大家认识到这是由于金星农林牧生产合作社领导人员警惕性不高，政治上麻痹。社主任孙学志（党员）说：“主要是在建社时党支部麻痹大意了，认为反革命分子张来全、张扁则已经改造好了，思想进步了，在入社后又表现积极，就麻痹大意了。”社妇女委员孙志秀说：“我们要是不分清敌我界限，就容易让敌人钻进我们内部来。”
    通过这次学习，应该吸取些什么教训呢？大家认为，要加强政治学习，提高革命警惕性，处处分清敌我界限；要加强社员和领导的团结，加强贫农和中农的团结。有的社员说：“只要我们团结的坚实，反革命分子就无法进行挑拨的阴谋活动。”妇女委员孙志秀说：“处处都要站稳阶级立场，不能麻痹大意，不让反革命分子钻空子。”社主任孙学志说：“经过这次学习可擦亮了眼睛了，像窗户纸似的一‘通’就透了，过去那里注意过这些事，认为敌人都老实了，他那敢吱声呢？今后可得时刻警惕。”孙福才等说：就拿咱村来说吧，谁钻进谁心里看去啦？对地主、富农要防备着点，决不能认为他们老实了，咱们就可以和和平平地走入社会主义社会哪！

    克服麻痹思想保卫农场建设编辑同志：
    看了“比杀人还狠，比放火还毒”一文后（载六月二十七日人民日报），我对平顺县反革命分子张来全、张扁则破坏全国著名的金星农林牧生产合作社的罪恶活动，感到无比的愤怒。同时，这个事件也使我更深刻地认识到：我们一时一刻也不能放松革命警觉性，必须随时识破和揭露敌人的阴谋鬼计，严厉制裁反革命罪犯。
    我在国营农场做工会工作，经常和职工生活在一起。过去我笼统地认为参加农场工作的工人是国家的主人，应该教育他们，依靠他们；因而听见了不利于农场建设的谣言，也不及时追根究底，就麻痹地认为是个别落后工人说“怪话”。其实，在我们农场里面还有地主、富农分子和政治情况很复杂的人，我们是丝毫也麻痹不得的。
    从反革命分子破坏全国农业劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰所领导的金星农林牧生产合作社的事件里，从全国人民声讨胡风反革命集团的政治斗争里，我一定记取教训，今后加紧学习，提高政治觉悟，学会向敌人作斗争的本领，坚决克服麻痹情绪，保卫农场建设，增产粮食，支援国家的社会主义工业建设。　辽宁省盘山机械农场工会　温泳波
    学会同敌人作斗争的本领编辑同志：
    我是一个国家机关的工作人员。看了六月二十七日人民日报“比杀人还狠，比放火还毒”的通讯和“肃清暗藏的反革命分子保卫农业互助合作运动”的社论后，我深深地认识到：敌人是无孔不入的。在任何一个工作岗位上，在任何一个场所，都要加强政治理论学习，随时随地提高革命警惕性。党曾一再地教导我们：过渡时期阶级斗争不但不会缓和，而且是更加复杂和尖锐了。胡风反革命集团的揭露，张来全、张扁则破坏金星农林牧生产合作社的反革命案件的揭露，都说明了敌人对我们所进行的伟大的社会主义建设事业是切齿痛恨的，敌人是不甘心让我们过幸福生活的。我们建设得越好越快，敌人的破坏活动就越猖狂。所以，我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，更加努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习政治理论，学会同一切形形色色的敌人进行斗争的本领，克服不问政治的麻痹思想，坚决彻底地肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。
