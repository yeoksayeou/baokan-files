    Developing agricultural cooperativization is a major measure for the socialist transformation of agriculture, a key to increasing agricultural production, strongly supporting industrial construction, and improving farmers' lives, and is the fundamental task of the Party in rural work. How are the Party organizations at all levels in Shaanxi Province implementing this fundamental task? What are the main achievements? What are the main shortcomings in the work? How should the leadership of the agricultural cooperativization movement be improved in the future? This was one of the main topics of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Representative Conference convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China from late May to early June.

    Since the first Party Representative Conference of Shaanxi Province last June, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Shaanxi Province has made great progress. According to statistics, there are currently 17,343 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province, with 520,500 peasant households participating, accounting for 16.83 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. Before July last year, there were only 883 agricultural cooperatives in the province, with the participating peasant households accounting for only 5.44 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. This means that in less than a year from the last Party Representative Conference of Shaanxi Province to now, the number of agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi has increased nearly twenty times.

    Agricultural production in Shaanxi Province has increased in recent years. Grain output in 1954 increased by 5.3 percent compared to 1953, overfulfilling the annual grain production plan. At the same time, with the increase in grain output, the farmers' marketable grain is also increasing year by year. Taking Baoji Prefecture, an important grain-producing area, as an example, the grain sold by farmers in the prefecture in 1954 increased by 49 percent compared to 1953. This was achieved by relying on the leadership and support of the Party and the government for mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and promoting the production enthusiasm of farmers, in a situation where there were not many agricultural cooperatives in the past. It is well known that agricultural cooperatives have more advantages than mutual aid teams. This means that the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province in the past year has created favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture in the future.

    The meeting affirmed these achievements and pointed out that this was the main aspect of the work in the past period.

    However, with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, many shortcomings and errors have also occurred in the work. Although these are not major or universal in the province, these shortcomings and errors have indeed seriously affected the normal development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. Therefore, in their speeches, the representatives made serious criticisms and self-criticisms of these shortcomings and errors, with the aim of making everyone deeply remember the lessons and further lead the agricultural cooperativization movement well.

    The meeting pointed out that during this period, a few Party organizations did not properly implement the Party's policy of "active leadership, steady progress" in building cooperatives. Many staff members had impatient and rash tendencies and put forward excessively high cooperative building plans. The work report made by the Provincial Party Committee to the conference and the speeches made by the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee in charge of rural work at the conference all reviewed that the 1955 cooperative building plan stipulated at the third mutual aid and cooperation meeting of the province last winter and approved by the Provincial Party Committee was too large. Many representatives also realized that they and the local party committees they participated in had the erroneous practice of subjectively adding plans at each level without proceeding from reality. For example, the CCP Hancheng County Committee, without conducting in-depth investigation and research, without comprehensively considering the subjective strength and the level of consciousness of the masses, and without making good preparations, determined to build 100 cooperatives before the summer harvest this year. After the cooperative building work started, it was discovered that many villages did not have the conditions to build cooperatives, and they had to reluctantly reduce the work to 78 townships and villages. After the start, these 78 places had to be stopped in the middle because the conditions were not met in 23 places. Finally, 55 cooperatives were built, but some cooperatives still had many problems, and the cooperative building work could not be completed for a long time.

    Precisely because the cooperative building plan was divorced from reality, it contributed to the commandist style of a few staff members. In some parts of Shaanxi, in order to pursue the so-called "whole township cooperativization" and "whole village cooperativization," some staff members even wrongly put forward the "quick method of building cooperatives," that is, using hard pulling and hard persuasion methods to force farmers to join the cooperatives. Another manifestation of blind advancement in cooperative building is that some areas have surpassed the level of consciousness of farmers and the lower-level cooperative forms that most farmers can currently accept, and blindly pursue cooperatives with more public property and more advanced forms. There are 300 new and old cooperatives in Luochuan, Huangling, and Yijun counties, of which 282 cooperatives have their livestock and large farm implements priced into the cooperatives or stored in the cooperatives. In some places, the depreciation of livestock and large farm implements is too low, and the repayment period is too long. Some places set the land dividend too low. Some places even abolished land remuneration too early. There are 303 agricultural cooperatives in Yan'an, Wuqi, and Huanglong counties, and 38 cooperatives have already abolished land remuneration, of which 31 cooperatives have abolished all remuneration regardless of whether it is a hillside or a flat land. Many farmers have opinions on these practices.

    Many representatives reviewed that the reason for these shortcomings and errors was that they regarded the work of transforming small peasant economy as too simple, did not seriously study and delve into the Party's policy of socialist transformation of agriculture, and rarely conducted in-depth investigations of local conditions, so they did not understand or did not fully understand the laws and specific steps of the agricultural cooperativization movement. After discussion, the representatives further clarified that leading farmers to take the road of agricultural cooperativization can only use the methods of persuasion, education, and typical demonstration to guide farmers to gradually move forward. All ideas of taking "shortcuts," "being afraid of trouble," and bureaucratic and commandist practices will harm the agricultural cooperativization movement. Facts have proved that the so-called "shortcut" is precisely a detour; the result of adopting simplified methods because of "being afraid of trouble" will precisely cause greater trouble.

    The meeting pointed out that another noteworthy problem in the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives is that Party organizations in many places have not fully implemented the Party's fundamental line of realizing agricultural socialist transformation in rural areas. Many representatives pointed out that in the agricultural cooperativization movement, Party organizations in various places also paid attention to selecting and cultivating a large number of poor peasant activists to the leading positions of agricultural cooperatives; they also paid attention to absorbing middle peasant activists to participate in the leadership work of agricultural cooperatives. These are important organizational measures for correctly implementing the Party's fundamental line. However, Party organizations in many places have not done well in helping to solve the difficulties in the lives of poor peasants in all aspects, and the ideological education of middle peasants is not enough. In the movement, middle peasants generally showed a tendency toward socialism; however, many middle peasants still have some concerns. This should be strengthened propaganda and education, but some places did not adopt this method, but held meetings to struggle against these farmers. This is wrong, and the representatives attending the meeting unanimously criticized it.

    Many representatives also pointed out that the above-mentioned shortcomings, errors, and the carelessness of staff members have given opportunities for rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries to infiltrate the cooperatives to carry out exploitation and other sabotage activities. In the nine agricultural cooperatives in the second, fourth, and sixth districts of Huaxian County, 32 enemy puppet officers and other counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated, of which eight have also usurped the leadership of the cooperatives. Inside and outside the cooperative, they adopted extremely insidious and vicious means—secretly harming livestock, destroying farm implements, and provoking internal relations among farmers—to sabotage the agricultural cooperative, attempting to bring down the cooperative. Therefore, everyone pointed out that vigilance and purification of the organization of the cooperative should attract the attention of all localities, especially those agricultural cooperatives with serious impure organizational components and local Party organizations.

    Representatives from various places also reviewed and criticized the errors of running cooperatives in isolation and neglecting the leadership of agricultural production. The meeting clearly pointed out that increasing agricultural production is the fundamental purpose of agricultural cooperativization and the common requirement of farmers joining the cooperatives. Therefore, leading the cooperative building work must be combined with leading agricultural production. The meeting pointed out that in the winter and spring of last year and this year, Shaanxi Province experienced a serious phenomenon of livestock losing weight and dying. This was certainly because the weather in the winter and spring of last year and this year was colder than in previous years, and there were difficulties in livestock breeding. But the main reason is that farmers did not care enough for livestock and the feeding management was not good. The reason why the problem of livestock feeding management and care cannot be solved well is also closely related to the method of adopting livestock depreciation to the cooperative too early and too much regardless of conditions. However, the Party organizations in some places did not grasp this serious problem in production, find out the reasons, and formulate effective improvement methods. In addition, the phenomenon of wasting labor and animal power in many agricultural cooperatives is also very serious, the production organization is reduced to formalism, and the production management work is quite chaotic. These phenomena are of course difficult to avoid absolutely in the process of gradual changes in production relations. However, as long as Party organizations in various places attach importance to the production and operation management of agricultural cooperatives, these phenomena can be greatly reduced and the time of chaos can be shortened. In addition, running cooperatives in isolation is also manifested in abandoning the leadership of mutual aid teams. Many representatives pointed out that this is because the understanding of developing and consolidating mutual aid teams as a preparation for building cooperatives is not enough or there is no understanding at all.

    Based on the cooperative building policy of "active leadership, steady progress" and "only allowing good management, not allowing bad management," the principle of developing a batch, consolidating a batch, and seeking development on the basis of consolidation, and proceeding from the current situation of the cooperativization movement in Shaanxi Province, the meeting determined that before the autumn harvest this year, all localities should generally stop developing new cooperatives and vigorously do a good job in rectifying, consolidating, and improving existing cooperatives, laying the foundation for developing agricultural cooperatives in batches this winter and next spring (building 10,000 new cooperatives, and the number of new households joining the cooperatives and the original households that have joined the cooperatives reaching about 23 percent of the total number of households). The meeting also pointed out that rectifying, consolidating, and developing agricultural cooperatives must proceed from reality and treat them separately. Those that should be developed should be developed, those that should be reduced should be reduced, and those that should be stopped from developing should be stopped from developing. It is wrong to blindly pursue quantity and speed without regard to the specific conditions at that time and place and without asking whether it is possible or not; on the contrary, it is also wrong to develop when there are conditions but not develop. These two biases are only beneficial to the enemy and detrimental to the cause of socialism.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Party Representative Conference ended on June 10. At this meeting, representatives from various places studied the resolutions and documents of the Party's National Congress, listened to and discussed the work report of the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, and finally elected the Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China Shaanxi Provincial Committee.

　　中共陕西省代表会议讨论农业合作问题
　　本报记者　艾方
    发展农业合作化运动，是对农业实行社会主义改造的重大措施，是提高农业生产，有力地支援工业建设和改善农民生活的关键所在，是党在农村工作的根本任务。陕西省党的各级组织执行这一根本任务的情况怎样？有哪些主要成绩？在工作中有哪些主要缺点？今后应当怎样改善对农业合作化运动的领导？这是五月下旬到六月上旬中共陕西省委召开的陕西省党代表会议的主要议题之一。
    自从去年六月陕西省第一次党代表大会以来，陕西省的农业合作化运动有了很大的发展。据统计：全省目前已有一万七千三百四十三个农业生产合作社，入社农户五十二万零五百户，占全省总农户的百分之十六点八三。去年七月以前，全省还只有八百八十三个农业社，入社农户只占全省总农户的百分之五点四四。这就是说，从去年陕西省党代表大会到现在，不到一年的时间，陕西的农业社已增加了将近二十倍。
    陕西省的农业生产，几年来都有提高。一九五四年粮食的产量比一九五三年增加了百分之五点三，超额完成了年度粮食生产计划。同时随着粮食产量的提高，农民的商品粮食也在逐年增加。以重要产粮地区的宝鸡专区为例：一九五四年该专区农民出售的粮食，就比一九五三年增加了百分之四十九。这还是在过去农业社还不多的情况下，依靠党和政府对互助组和个体农民的领导和扶持，发扬了农民的生产积极性以后获得的。农业社比互助组具有更多的优越性，这是很多人都知道的。这就是说，过去一年内陕西省农业社的大量发展，已经为今后农业增产，同时对农业进行社会主义改造，创造了有利条件。
    会议肯定了这些成绩，并且指出这是过去一个时期工作中的主要方面。
    但是，随着农业合作化运动的发展，工作中也产生了许多缺点和错误。这在全省来说，虽然不是主要的、普遍的，但这些缺点和错误确实已严重地影响到农业合作化运动的正常开展。因此，代表们在发言中，对这些缺点和错误进行了严肃的批评和自我批评，目的是为了使大家深刻地记取教训，进一步把农业合作化运动领导好。
    会议指出了，在这一期间，少数党组织没有很好地贯彻党的“积极领导，稳步前进”的建社方针。许多工作人员有急躁冒进的情绪，提出了过高的建社计划。省委向大会所做的工作报告，省委管理农村工作的同志在大会上的发言，都检讨到去年冬天省的第三次互助合作会议上所规定、经省委批准的一九五五年建社计划偏大。许多代表也认识到自己和自己所参加的地方党委，有不从实际出发，主观主义地层层追加计划的错误做法。例如，中共韩城县委没有经过深入的调查研究，没有全面地考虑主观力量和群众的觉悟水平，也没有作好准备工作，就确定今年夏收前建一百个社。等到建社工作开始后，才发现许多乡村建社条件不够，只得勉强缩小到在七十八个乡、村进行建社工作。开始以后，这七十八处又因为条件不具备，而中途又不得不停止了二十三处。最后算是建了五十五个社，但有些社问题还很多，建社工作迟迟不能结束。
    正因为建社计划脱离实际，就助长了少数工作人员的强迫命令作风。在陕西的部分地方，为了追求所谓“全乡合作化”、“全村合作化”，有些工作人员竟错误地提出了“建社速成法”，即采用硬拉、硬劝的方法，强迫农民入社。建社中的盲目冒进的另外一种表现，是有的地区超越了农民的觉悟水平和当前多数农民所能接受的较低级的合作社形式，盲目追求公共财产比较多的、比较高级形式的社。洛川、黄陵、宜君等三个县共有新老社三百个，而其中就有二百八十二个社的牲畜和大农具是折价入社或存社的。有些地方牲畜、大农具折价偏低，还款期限过长。有些地方把土地分红定得太低。有些地方甚至过早地取消了土地报酬。延安、吴旗、黄龙三县，共有农业社三百零三个，就有三十八个社已经取消了土地报酬，其中有三十一个社，无论山坡地或是平川地，全部取消了报酬。不少农民对这些做法是有意见的。
    许多代表检讨到，造成这些缺点和错误的原因，是由于自己把改造小农经济这一工作看得太简单，没有认真地学习、钻研党对农业实行社会主义改造的政策，又很少深入调查当地的情况，因而不了解或不完全了解农业合作化运动的规律和具体步骤。经过讨论，代表们进一步明确了：领导农民走农业合作化的道路，只能用说服教育和典型示范的方法，引导农民逐步前进，一切走“捷径”、“怕麻烦”的想法和官僚主义、强迫命令的做法，都会损害农业合作化运动。事实已经证明：所谓“捷径”，恰恰是弯路；“怕麻烦”而采取简单化办法的结果，恰恰会造成更大的麻烦。
    会议指出了，在发展和巩固农业社上的另一个值得注意的问题，是不少地方的党组织没有全面地贯彻党在农村实现农业社会主义改造的根本路线。许多代表指出，在农业合作化运动中，各地党组织也注意了选拔、培养大量贫农积极分子到农业社的领导岗位上来；也注意了吸收中农积极分子参加农业社的领导工作。这些都是正确贯彻党的根本路线的重要组织措施。但是，不少地方的党组织从各方面帮助解决贫农生活上的困难还做得不好，对中农的思想教育不够。在运动中，中农普遍表现倾向于社会主义；但是也有不少中农还存在一些顾虑。这就应当加强宣传教育，但是有的地方却不是采取这种办法，而是开会斗争这些农民。这是错误的，到会代表对此一致提出了批评。
    许多代表也指出，上述缺点、错误和工作人员的麻痹大意，已经给了富农和反革命分子混入社内进行剥削和进行其他破坏活动的机会。在华县二、四、六区的九个农业社里，已经混进了敌伪军官及其他反革命分子三十二人，其中有八人还窃取了社的领导权。他们在合作社内部和外部，采取了极其阴险毒辣的手段——暗害牲畜，破坏农具，挑拨农民内部关系，来破坏农业社，企图把社搞垮。因此，大家指出：提高警惕，纯洁合作社的组织，应该引起各地，特别是那些组织成份严重不纯的农业社和当地党组织的高度注意。
    各地代表在发言中，还检讨和批判了孤立办社、忽视对农业生产领导的错误。会议明确地指出：提高农业生产是农业合作化的根本目的，也是入社农民的共同要求，因此领导建社工作必须和领导农业生产相结合。会议指出了去冬今春，陕西不少地区发生了牲畜落膘、死亡的严重现象。这固然因为去冬今春天气较往年冷，牲畜饲养上有困难。但主要原因，是因为农民对牲畜爱护不够和饲养管理不善。而牲畜的饲养管理和爱护问题所以不能很好地解决，又同不顾条件，过早过多地采取牲畜折价归社的办法有很大关系。但是，有些地方的党组织，并没有抓紧生产上的这一严重问题，找出原因定出有效的改进办法。此外，许多农业社浪费劳力、畜力的现象也很严重，生产组织流于形式，生产管理工作相当混乱。这些现象，在生产关系逐步变革当中，固然是很难绝对避免的。但是，只要各地党组织重视农业社的生产和经营管理工作，就可以大大地减少这些现象，缩短混乱的时间。此外，孤立办社，还表现在放弃了对互助组的领导上。许多代表指出：这是对发展和巩固互助组是建社的准备工作理解得不够或根本没有了解的缘故。
    会议根据“积极领导，稳步前进”，“只许办好，不许办坏”的建社方针，发展一批，巩固一批，在巩固的基础上求发展的原则，从陕西省合作化运动的当前情况出发，确定：今年秋收以前，各地一般应停止发展新社，大力做好整顿、巩固和提高现有社的工作，为今冬明春分批发展农业社（新建社一万个，新入社户和原已入社的户达到总农户的百分之二十三左右）奠定基础。会议还指出：整顿、巩固和发展农业社，必须从实际出发，分别对待，应当发展的发展，应当缩小的缩小，应当停止发展的停止发展。离开当时当地的具体条件，不问可能与否，一味贪多图快是错误的；相反的有条件发展而不发展，也是错误的。这两种偏向，都只是有利于敌人，不利于社会主义事业。
    六月十日，陕西省党代表会议已经结束了。在这次会议上，来自各地的代表，在会上学习了党的全国代表会议的决议和文件，听取和讨论了中共陕西省委的工作报告，最后选出了中国共产党陕西省监察委员会。
