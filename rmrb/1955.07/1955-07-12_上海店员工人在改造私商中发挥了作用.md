Shanghai shop employees play a role in transforming private businesses

Liu Qing, Duan Bojun

With the progress of socialist transformation, the number of private retail stores in Shanghai incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism is constantly increasing. Currently, private retail stores in 32 industries, including rice, cotton cloth, and general merchandise, have become sales agents and distributors for state-owned commercial enterprises or have established wholesale relationships with them. These stores have become the main part of the current private retail sector. After private retail stores are incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism, their nature has changed to varying degrees, but this is only the beginning of the transformation. To make their business activities truly conform to the requirements of the state plan and better play their positive role in serving commodity circulation and the needs of the people, it is necessary to further strengthen the transformation of stores and capitalists. Shop employees strengthening supervision of business activities within the stores is an important aspect of doing a good job of transformation. Over the past year, the vast number of shop employees in Shanghai have done a lot of work in this area.

Supervising capitalists to correctly compile and implement purchase and sales plans, in order to gradually change the past blindness of operation and gradually improve the correctness of their plans, is one of the specific ways to transform private retailers. Capitalists generally do not pay much attention to planning work. Some of them, using the excuse that "they have never made a plan before," do not take a proactive attitude; some have the idea of ​​"rather small than big" when making plans, so there is often a phenomenon that the actual purchase and sales results exceed the original planned number by several times; some do not study consumer needs, blindly want "famous brands," and only choose goods with high profits. Even if consumers need some goods with lower profits, they do not actively strive for them; some compile plans but do not seriously implement them. These situations fully demonstrate the blindness of capitalist operation. Therefore, it is very necessary for shop employees to strengthen supervision in this area. Shop employees in Shanghai have played a not small role in criticizing capitalists' blind business ideas and strengthening the business planning of private retail stores. For example, the shop assistants of Shunda Xiang Cloth Shop established a business group to review the plan made by the capitalist. In February of this year, the original purchase plan of the capitalist was 395 bolts of cloth. After review and comments by the shop assistants, it was changed to 519 bolts of cloth, and the actual sales still exceeded this number; the original plan included Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji (popular goods). The shop assistants suggested that Daxin Yuan Biji could be used instead based on the country's production situation, and the plan was changed after the capitalist agreed.

After private retailers began to be incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism, the state strengthened restrictions and management on its operations, and the shop assistants strengthened supervision over it. Therefore, the business style has greatly improved compared with the past. However, the nature of capitalists' pursuit of profit determines that they will inevitably use gaps to engage in various dishonest activities such as deceiving customers and violating public-private contracts. For example, many capitalists still have illegal behaviors to varying degrees, such as using inferior goods to impersonate good goods, raising prices, and short weights. Therefore, educating and supervising capitalists to correct their business style, establish new business ethics, and better serve consumers is a constant political task. Shop employees must strengthen supervision in this area. When rice retailers were first changed to sales agents of the state-owned grain company, shop employees launched a resolute struggle in supervising capitalists to abide by public-private contracts, not to go out to canvass sales, not to collect long-term checks indiscriminately, and not to do credit business. Department store shop assistants exposed speculative behaviors of capitalists selling distribution goods as consignment goods and selling consignment goods at distribution prices. Due to the supervision of the shop assistants, the cotton cloth industry corrected the past practices of deceiving customers by using black foreign cloth to impersonate black foreign yarn and using 42-count yarn poplin to impersonate 60-count yarn poplin.

Shanghai's private retail store employees have also played a significant role in uniting and educating capitalists to actively operate, actively promote goods for state-owned companies, and assist in completing state plans. Because the government implemented measures to arrange and transform private retailers, reducing the number of state-owned and cooperative retail stores, and adopted measures such as increasing the establishment of state-owned wholesale institutions, lowering wholesale starting points, simplifying wholesale procedures, rationally allocating sources of goods, and bank matching loans, etc., to fully utilize the supply network of private retailers and give play to their operational enthusiasm, this makes private retailers have a greater responsibility in undertaking to meet consumer needs, expand commodity circulation, and complete the country's commodity sales plan. However, many capitalists have negative emotions: some simply rely on state-owned companies to take care of giving them popular goods and are unwilling to promote slow-selling goods; some simply rely on bank loans; some even have the idea of ​​"discarding the burden," so they do not care about store affairs and hope to collapse the enterprise as soon as possible. Under the education of the Party and the trade union, the vast number of shop employees launched a resolute struggle against this negative attitude of capitalists resisting transformation, and took active actions to win over and unite capitalists to operate well.

In the past, capitalist commerce in Shanghai relied on the false prosperity of the old society to develop through speculation and profiteering in blind competition. With the progress of socialist transformation, speculative activities are increasingly restricted, so the decadence of capitalist commerce is increasingly exposed. Poor management, unreasonable expenses, and high commodity loss rates are the fundamental reasons for the operating difficulties of private commerce. In response to this situation, the shop assistants have done a lot of work, urging capitalists to reduce unnecessary expenses, reduce commodity losses, so as to save from all aspects, reduce circulation costs, rationally use funds, better maintain the enterprise, and implement the policy of gradual transformation. For example, when Yulin District Datong Xin Nanhuo Store employees implemented market arrangement measures in the first quarter of this year, they started from saving internal store expenses, strengthening labor discipline, and clarifying the division of labor, and took practical actions to unite and urge capitalists to actively operate and overcome difficulties. With the gradual improvement of socialist consciousness, the shop assistants have realized that they must establish the point of view of wholeheartedly serving consumers, so there have also been significant improvements in service attitude. The shop assistants of Baochang Woolen Store in Changning District patiently introduced the advantages of blended woolen yarn (new product) to customers, expanding the sales of the new product. Recently, when the department store shop assistants in the old Zha District promoted slow-selling products for the state-owned department store company, they displayed the promoted products in special counters, made banners with red cloth to attract customers' attention, and actively promoted them to customers. In this way, not only did they promote many accumulated commodities of state-owned companies, but they also increased the turnover of private retailers, striving for the continued improvement of the enterprise, and further giving play to the positive role of private commerce in expanding commodity circulation at present.

Private retail stores in Shanghai that have been incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism have undergone great changes compared to the past under the management of the government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of shop employees, showing the superiority of state capitalist enterprises over capitalist enterprises. Shop employees have played an active supporting role in implementing the state's socialist transformation of private retailers. However, from the perspective of gradually and deeply transforming private retail commerce until it finally becomes a state-owned retail network, replacing capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people, it still requires a long and complex struggle. At present, shop employees generally have a paralyzing ideology in their thinking, believing that they have already hung up the "sales agent" and "distributor" signs, and the transformation is "almost done"; the operation has also improved, and the capitalists are "honest," so they relax supervision of the capitalists. Among the general young shop employees, there is a general impatience, and even wrong ideas, thinking that working in private retail stores is "unpromising" and "wasting youth," so they are not at ease with their work, and labor discipline is lax, which affects further transformation of the enterprise and the capitalists. Therefore, the Party organizations and trade union organizations in Shanghai are continuing to carry out in-depth and specific general task education for shop employees to improve their socialist consciousness, so that they can recognize the responsibility of shop employees in the socialist transformation cause, and better strive to realize the country's general task during the transition period.

    上海店员工人在改造私商中发挥了作用
    柳青　段伯钧
    随着社会主义改造事业的进展，上海市纳入国家资本主义轨道的私营零售商正在不断增加。目前，已有米、棉布、百货等三十二个行业的私营零售商店，做了国营商业的代销店和经销店，或者同国营商业建立了批购关系。这些商店已成为当前私营零售商中的主要部分。私营零售商店纳入国家资本主义的轨道后，它的性质已经有了不同程度的变化，但这还仅仅是改造的开始。要使它们的经营活动在实际上完全符合国家计划的要求，更好地发挥它们为商品流通服务、为人民需要服务的积极作用，还需要进一步加强对商店的改造和对资本家的改造。店员工人在商店内部，加强对经营活动的监督，是做好改造工作的重要方面。一年多来，上海市的广大店员工人，在这一方面做了不少工作。
    督促资本家正确编造和执行购销计划，以逐步改变过去经营的盲目性，逐步提高其计划的正确性，是对私营零售商实行改造的具体办法之一。资本家对待计划工作一般是很不重视的。其中有些人借口“过去从未订过计划”，不采取积极的态度；有些人订计划时有“宁小勿大”思想，因此常有购销实绩超过原订计划数倍的现象；有些人不研究消费者需要，盲目要“名牌货”，尽拣利润高的商品，对有些利润较低的商品，即使消费者需要，也不积极争取；有些人编好计划，却不去认真执行。这些情况，充分说明了资本主义经营上的盲目性。因此，店员工人在这方面加强监督，就显得非常必要。上海市的店员工人在批判资本家的盲目经营思想，和加强私营零售店的经营计划性方面起了不小的作用。如顺大祥布店店员建立了业务小组，来审查资本家订的计划。今年二月份，资方原订的进货计划是三百九十五匹布，经店员们审查提意见后，改为五百一十九匹布，而实销还超过了这个数目；原计划订有四君子元哔叽（热门货），店员们根据国家的生产情况提出可以用大新元哔叽代替，经资本家同意后改订了计划。
    私营零售商开始纳入国家资本主义轨道后，国家在经营上对它加强了限制和管理，店员们对它加强了监督，因此，经营作风比以前有了很大改善。但是资本家唯利是图的本质决定他必然会利用空隙，进行各种欺骗顾客、违反公私合约等不老实的活动。例如许多资本家还在不同程度上有以次货充好货、抬高价格、缺码短斤等不法行为。因此，教育和监督资本家端正经营作风，树立新的商业道德，更好地为消费者服务，这是一个经常的政治任务。店员工人必须加强在这方面的监督。米业零售商刚改为国营粮食公司的代销店时，店员工人在监督资本家遵守公私合约，不出外兜销、不乱收远期支票、不做赊欠生意等方面，展开了坚决的斗争。百货业店员揭发了资本家把经销品充代销品出售，把代销品照经销品价格出售等投机行为。由于店员们的监督，棉布业纠正了过去以黑洋布充黑洋纱，以四十二支纱府绸充六十支纱府绸等的欺骗顾客的作风。
    上海私营零售商店店员在团结教育资本家积极经营，为国营公司积极推销商品，协助完成国家计划方面，也起了很大的作用。由于政府贯彻了对私营零售商的安排和改造的措施，减少了部分国营和合作社的零售店，并且采取了增设国营批发机构、降低批发起点、简化批发手续、合理分配货源，以及银行配合贷款等措施，以充分利用私营零售商的供应网，发挥它们的经营积极性，这就使得私营零售商在担负起满足消费者的需要、扩大商品流通、完成国家的商品销售计划上，有了更加重大的责任。但是不少资本家却有消极情绪：有些是单纯依赖国营公司照顾给予热门货，不愿推销滞销货；有些单纯依赖银行贷款；有些甚至有“丢包袱”思想，因而不管店务，指望早日搞垮企业。广大店员工人在党和工会教育下，向资本家这种抗拒改造的消极态度展开了坚决的斗争，并以积极行动来争取和团结资本家好好经营。
    上海市的资本主义商业过去是在盲目竞争中依靠旧社会的虚假繁荣，投机牟利发展起来的。随着社会主义改造事业的进展，投机活动受到越来越大的限制，因此，资本主义商业的腐朽性就日益暴露。经营管理不善，费用开支不合理，商品损耗率大，是造成私营商业经营困难的根本原因。针对这种情况，店员们做了许多工作，督促资本家减少不必要的开支，减少商品损耗，以便从各方面进行节约，降低流转费用，合理运用资金，更好地维持企业、贯彻逐步改造的方针。如榆林区大同新南货店店员，在今年第一季度贯彻安排市场措施时，就是从节约商店内部开支，加强劳动纪律，明确分工等方面着手，以实际行动团结、督促资本家积极经营，克服了困难。随着社会主义觉悟的逐渐提高，店员工人们认识到必须树立全心全意为消费者服务的观点，因而在服务态度方面，也有了显著的改进。长宁区宝昌绒线店店员耐心向顾客介绍混纺绒线（新产品）的优点，扩大了新产品的销路。老闸区百货业店员最近在为国营百货公司推销滞销品时，把推销的商品陈列在专柜里，用红布制成横幅，以吸引顾客注意，并主动向顾客宣传。这样，不但推销了国营公司的许多积压商品，也增加了私营零售商的营业额，争取了企业的继续好转，进一步发挥了私营商业在目前扩大商品流通中的积极作用。
    上海市纳入国家资本主义轨道的私营零售店，在政府的管理、国营经济的领导和店员工人的监督下，跟以往有了很大的变化，表现出了国家资本主义企业较之资本主义企业的优越性。店员工人们在贯彻国家对私营零售商的社会主义改造中，起了积极的支持作用。但是从对私营零售商业逐步深入改造，直至最后使之成为国营的零售网，以全民所有制来代替资本家所有制的要求看来，则还需要经过长期复杂的斗争。而当前店员工人在思想上却有较普遍麻痹思想。认为已经挂上了“代销”“经销”牌子，改造已经“差不多”了；经营也已好转，资本家“老实”了，因而放松对资本家的监督。在一般青年店员中，则普遍有急躁情绪，甚至有错误的想法，认为在私营零售店里工作“没出息”、“浪费了青春”，因此不安心工作，劳动纪律松弛，影响了进一步对企业和对资本家的改造。因此，上海市的党组织和工会组织正在继续对店员工人进行深入具体的总任务教育，以提高他们的社会主义觉悟，使他们认识店员工人在社会主义改造事业中的责任，更好地为实现国家过渡时期的总任务而努力。
