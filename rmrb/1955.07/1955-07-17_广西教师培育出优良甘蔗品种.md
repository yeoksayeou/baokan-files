Guangxi Agricultural College teachers are conducting nearly fifty scientific research projects this year, and some of the research projects with economic value have already yielded results.

These research topics were determined based on the agricultural needs of Guangxi Province. Teachers have been conducting comparative experiments on sugarcane varieties for three years. Among the seven varieties collected from various parts of Guangxi, they have cultivated two superior varieties that yield 50% higher than local varieties, and have initially promoted them in rural areas near the school. If these two varieties are promoted throughout the province, based on the current sugarcane production in Guangxi, it could increase sugar production by 140 million catties annually.

The agricultural college teachers are experimenting on the college farm with an experience of Guangxi farmers to increase peanut production. This experience is to apply fertilizer mixed with raw salt when planting peanuts, which can increase peanut production by more than double. The teachers are preparing to find out the scientific reason for this.

The agricultural college teachers also transplanted a kind of beef-fat tree, which grows in the mountainous area of Zhendu County in southern Guangxi Province, to the north using the Michurin scientific method. Zhuang farmers feed the leaves of this tree to cattle, and the cattle grow fat and strong. The director of the school's Scientific Research Committee said: The transplantation experiment is expected to be completed this year, and it is of great value for solving the problem of winter feed for cattle in the north.

    广西教师培育出优良甘蔗品种
    广西农学院教师今年进行近五十项科学研究，其中一部分有经济价值的研究项目已得出结果。
    这些研究题目是根据广西省农业需要而确定的。教师们对甘蔗品种的比较试验已进行了三年。他们在广西各地收集的七种品种中，已培育出两种比当地产量高出百分之五十的优良品种，并初步在学校附近农村推广。这两个品种如在全省推广后，按照目前广西甘蔗产量，每年可以增产蔗糖一亿四千万斤。
    农学院教师正在学院农场里实验一项广西农民增产花生的经验，这个经验是在种花生时施用生盐拌的肥料，可使花生增产一倍多。教师们准备找出它的科学道理。
    农学院教师还把在广西省南部镇都县山区生长的一种肥牛树，用米丘林科学方法迁植到北部。僮族农民把这种树叶喂牛，牛只长得肥壮。这个学校的科学研究委员会主任说：迁植试验在今年内就要完成，它对解决北部耕牛的冬季饲料问题，有很大的价值。　（新华社）
