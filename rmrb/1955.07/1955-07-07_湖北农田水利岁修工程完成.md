　　Hubei Farmland Water Conservancy Annual Repair Project Completed

　　The annual farmland water conservancy repair project in Hubei Province was basically completed by the end of May. According to preliminary statistics, over the past winter and spring, the province has completed more than 230 newly built, expanded, and renovated irrigation projects covering over 300 mu each, and over 230,000 newly built and renovated small-scale water conservancy facilities such as ponds, dams, ditches, canals, and sluice gates. At the same time, more than 40 larger drainage projects were newly built and renovated. After the completion of these projects, in addition to restoring the original irrigated farmland, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 400,000 mu, and the irrigated area has been improved by nearly 5 million mu; it has also greatly enhanced the flood prevention and waterlogging drainage capacity of the areas along the rivers and lakes, ensuring that farmers can divert water to irrigate their fields in a timely manner this year. For example, after the Shiziling Reservoir released water in May, more than 20,000 mu of farmland in six nearby townships were irrigated, ensuring timely rice transplanting. After the completion of the Wofochuan Roller Dam in Gucheng County, the irrigation problem of more than 2,000 mu of farmland was solved, and production was guaranteed. (Cao Jianmin, Wen Xiguang)

　  湖北农田水利岁修工程完成
    湖北省农田水利岁修工程已在五月底基本完成。据初步统计，全省去冬今春共完成新建、扩建和整修的三百亩以上的灌溉工程二百三十多处，新建和整修的塘、坝、沟、渠、闸等小型水利设施二十三万余处。同时还新建、整修较大排水工程四十多处。这些工程完成后，除恢复原有灌溉受益田亩外，还扩大了灌溉面积四十余万亩，改善了灌溉面积近五百万亩；也大大增强了沿江湖地区防涝、排渍能力，保证了农民今年能及时引水灌田。如石子岭水库在五月份开闸放水后，使附近六个乡二万多亩农田灌上了水，做到了按时插秧。谷城县卧佛川滚水坝完工后，解决了二千余亩农田的灌溉问题，生产得到了保证。（曹健民、文晞光）
