Cherishing Oil Drilling Equipment

Wen Bo

The Jiuquan Drilling Team is one of the major drilling units in China's petroleum industry. In order to explore the underground resources of the Jiuquan area as soon as possible, the state has allocated a large number of drilling equipment to the Jiuquan Drilling Team. This equipment is not only valuable state property, but also an important material force for the Jiuquan Drilling Team to complete its drilling tasks. However, the Jiuquan Drilling Team did not cherish these drilling equipment very much. On the contrary, they allowed them to be lost and damaged, causing great waste to the state.

In the Jiuquan Drilling Team, whenever a well team completes its task and moves on, many discarded equipment and materials are left on the well site. According to an inspection of 57 completed wells that were completed one to two years ago, more than 800 drill pipes of various types, more than 190 oil pipes, 80 drill collars, 4 square drill pipes, one mud pump, eight various tanks, five rat hole pipes, as well as drill bit loaders, lifting cards, steel wire ropes, pistons, radiators, angle iron, oil test iron frames and other equipment were found. There were also nearly ten tons of materials such as lime, cement, barite powder, crucible soil, lignite, salt, and caustic soda. Some of these valuable equipment are still not manufactured in China and need to be ordered from abroad. There is also serious waste on the drilling sites that are currently in progress. Some well teams casually place dozens of kilograms of butter in a wooden box without a lid, and randomly place new packing on the ground, which is very easy for sand to enter and wear the machine. Some well teams use thousands of gallons more water than actually needed every day. More seriously, a new piston on a pump was casually thrown on the ground to be used as a stool, and some people even stepped on it while playing, thus damaging a new piston.

Why are so many valuable equipment discarded and damaged at will? It turns out that the Jiuquan Drilling Team, from top to bottom, has the mistaken idea of ​​only focusing on footage and neglecting conservation. Some people even think that these wastes are unimportant trivial matters. They also don't pay much attention to whether they waste or not when selecting labor models. Some well teams have serious waste phenomena, but they are rated as model teams because of their fast footage, so that some well teams mistakenly believe: "More footage is fine, it doesn't matter if we conserve or not." The supply work of the pipeline station is also responsive to every request. Whenever the well needs drill pipes or drill collars, they give them; no matter how much they want, they give them. As for how many drill pipes and drill collars are actually used on site, they have no idea.

China's petroleum industry has a weak foundation, and the country urgently needs petroleum. Of course, it is right to focus on the footage of oil drilling. However, does focusing on footage necessarily mean wasting equipment? Does it mean putting butter in a box without a lid and putting new packing on the ground to sit on as a stool? Obviously, no one can say that. On the contrary, wasting a large number of valuable equipment that needs to be ordered from abroad will affect the footage if the supply is not available during drilling. The Jiuquan Drilling Team must correct the one-sided idea of ​​ignoring conservation, strictly implement the equipment management system, and educate employees to cherish state equipment in order to avoid waste and ensure drilling footage.

    爱惜石油钻探器材
    文博
    酒泉钻探处是我国石油工业中主要钻探单位之一。为了早日探明酒泉地区的地下资源，国家曾给酒泉钻探处调拨了大批钻探器材。这些器材不仅是国家宝贵的财产，而且是酒泉钻探处用以完成钻探任务的重要物质力量，但酒泉钻探处并没有十分爱惜这些钻探器材，反而任凭它们散失损坏，给国家造成很大的浪费。
    在酒泉钻探处，每当井队完成任务移转时，井场上总留下许多被扔掉的设备器材。根据对完工已一年至二年的五十七口井的检查，就清查出各种类型的钻杆八百多根，油管一百九十多根，钻铤八十根，方钻杆四根，泥浆泵一个，各种罐八个，鼠洞管五个以及钻头装卸器、吊卡、钢丝绳、活塞、散热器、角铁、试油铁架等器材，还有石灰、水泥、重晶石粉、坩子土、褐煤、食盐、烧碱等材料近十吨重。其中有些贵重器材，还是我国目前不能制造，需要从国外订购的。正在钻进的井场同样有严重的浪费。有的井队把几十公斤黄油随便放在没有盖子的木箱中，把新盘根乱放在地上，极易渗入沙子磨损机器；有的井队每天用水较实际多几千加仑。更严重的是，一个泵上的新活塞竟被人随便扔在地上当凳子坐，还有人在上边踩着玩，一个新活塞就这样被损坏了。
      为什么这样多的贵重器材被随便扔弃损坏呢？原来酒泉钻探处自上而下有只重进尺，忽视节约的错误思想，甚至有的人认为这些浪费是无关重要的小事。他们在评选劳动模范时也是不大管浪费不浪费的，有的井队虽然有严重的浪费现象，但由于进尺快就被评为模范队，以致有的井队错误地认为：
  “多进尺就行了，节约不节约没什么关系。”管子站的供应工作也是有求必应，井上啥时候要钻杆，钻铤，就啥时候给；要多少，给多少。至于现场使用的钻杆、钻铤究竟有多少，却心中无数。
    我国石油工业的基础薄弱，国家迫切需要石油。重视石油钻探的进尺当然是对的。可是，难道说重视进尺就必须浪费器材吗？就必须把黄油放在没有盖子的箱子里，把新盘根放在地上当凳子坐吗？显然，谁也不能这么说。相反的，把大量贵重的需要从国外订购的器材浪费掉，钻探时供应不上，到是会影响进尺的。酒泉钻探处必须纠正忽视节约的片面思想，严格执行器材管理制度，教育员工爱护国家器材，以避免浪费，保证钻探进尺。
