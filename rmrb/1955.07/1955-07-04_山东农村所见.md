    Welcoming the Second Session of the First National People's Congress
    What I Saw in Rural Shandong
    Wang Baozhen, Representative to the National People's Congress
    Last winter, I inspected twenty-five counties in Hebei Province. This June, with a spirit of learning, I inspected Shandong and Henan provinces again, and saw the achievements created by the laboring people and leading staff of the two provinces united together. The following is a brief account of my impressions of the development of agricultural production and grain work in Shandong.

    I. Increased Production on Terrace Fields, People's Lives Becoming Increasingly Prosperous
    The Xintun Township area in western Gaomi County used to be the Baimai Lake, a low-lying alkaline land, where only sorghum could be grown, with a yield of no more than 100 jin per mu. The laboring people created terrace fields in the low-lying land, which could increase the yield by two or three times per mu. However, during the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the rent grain alone was 75 jin per mu. For example, Chen Jisheng's family could only eat eight jin of grain per person per month at that time, and finally had to sell all fourteen mu of land and flee from famine. At that time, many terrace fields were abandoned. After liberation, the masses repaired the terrace fields and built many new ones, which not only prevented waterlogging and alkali washing, but also produced more cotton. In 1954, the average yield of seed cotton in Xintun Township was 207 jin per mu, which was more than ten times higher than the value of 100 jin of sorghum produced in low-lying land. Liu Honggang, the director of the Yongsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative and a labor model, produced 600 jin of irrigated cotton per mu.
    There are fifteen agricultural production cooperatives in Xintun Township, with the number of participating households accounting for more than 85% of the total number of farming households. The deputy directors of the three large cooperatives (Yousheng, Shengli, and Yongsheng) are all young women. The three cooperatives launched a production competition and all achieved excellent results. Chen Hongsheng, the director of the agricultural cooperative, said: "Now, when we hand in public grain, ditches are not counted within the acreage of the fields; but in old China, it was not like this, even ditches had to be taxed. Now, we only have to hand in eight jin of seed cotton per mu that produces 200 jin of seed cotton, which is several times less than the grain tax in the old days."
    A township head in the Seventh District said: Every family in Datun Village has a thermos bottle, and young men and women wear khaki uniforms and floral cloth clothes during the New Year and other festive occasions, and many people have rubber shoes. The township head, cooperative directors, and female deputy directors all said: If it weren't for the care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the people's lives, how could we be able to eat our fill and dress well today!

    II. Soil and Water Conservation Work and Small Reservoirs in Mountainous Areas Ensure Increased Grain Production
    In the Wangzhuang and Chenzhuang areas of Longshan Township, Yishui County, a lot of mountain floods and sand have been washing away the land over the years, and the area of affected land has been expanding year by year. As a result, the lives of the masses are extremely poor, and often fifty or sixty households go out to beg for food in the spring, only returning home when the wheat is harvested. Since the Communist Party and the People's Government led the farmers to dam the mountain gullies and build reservoirs, the situation has changed. The masses reflected: It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who dammed the water, so many lands were no longer flooded, and the silt became fertile fields. Not only are there no more people begging for food, but last year the whole township also sold 182,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This spring was dry, but because the land was irrigated with water from the reservoir, the yield was still 200 jin of wheat per mu.
    The situation of water conservancy construction in many townships in Yishui County is similar to that of Longshan Township. The county has dammed 6,500 mountain gullies, built 1,986 people-run slow-water dams, 54,321 people-built dams (reservoirs), silted up more than 7,000 mu of land, terraced 2,237,000 fields, built five people-built small reservoirs, five publicly-run small reservoirs, and afforested 330,000 mu. It is required that all 500,000 mu of barren mountains in the county be completely greened in the first five-year plan.
    However, it is not just Yishui County that is like this. According to statistics, the province has dammed 152,000 mountain gullies and built more than 48,900 reservoirs, which have freed 17,410,000 mu of land from waterlogging and 8,200,000 mu of land from drought. It can be seen how much these water conservancy projects have contributed to increased grain production.
    The development of water conservancy work has also promoted the development of agricultural cooperativization. The Zhongsu Youhao (Sino-Soviet Friendship) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songfeng Township, Yishui County, used the Taiping Guanzhuang Reservoir to irrigate the land, which led to high yields, and the cooperative also expanded. Liu Liansheng, the director of the cooperative, said: "Our cooperative was formed in 1954, with only eighteen households at that time. Before the establishment of the cooperative, there were twelve households in need of grain. After these twelve households joined the cooperative, in addition to the four households that needed to be supplied with 220 jin of grain, the remaining eight households also sold 1,800 jin of surplus grain. This year, our cooperative has expanded to fifty-one households. Last year, our early autumn crops yielded an average of 240 jin per mu, the mutual aid groups yielded 170 jin, and the individual farmers yielded 90 jin. It is precisely because the masses have personally seen the superiority and benefits of the cooperative that our cooperative has expanded. Last year, the irrigated land yielded 648 jin of millet per mu, the generally irrigated land yielded 340 jin of millet, and the non-irrigated land yielded only 130 jin. Corn that was irrigated and fertilized yielded 800 jin per mu, while the non-irrigated land yielded only 100 jin. The members of our cooperative actively sold their grain to the state after they harvested it. If the government had not built the reservoir well, our cooperative would not have been able to irrigate the land and would not have been able to obtain high yields. We sincerely thank Chairman Mao for his concern for the people's lives, and we resolutely support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain."

    III. Large Puddles Turn into Grain Storage
    The Twelve Lianwa area in northeastern Yuncheng County has always had a flooded area of more than 20,000 mu. The Party and the government led the farmers to dig a large number of reservoirs, intercepting ditches, and diversion canals from 1952 to 1954, and built a reservoir with an area of 465 mu. In 1954, this area achieved a bumper harvest. Under the influence of the successful transformation of the Twelve Lianwa area, the Houji Dawa area (with an area of about 130,000 mu) thirty miles northwest of Yuncheng was also automatically transformed by the masses into ditch-ridge fields, and last year this area also achieved an unprecedented harvest. The masses reflected that the large puddles had turned into grain storage. And there is a folk song: "The Communist Party's method is complete, digging ditches and storing water leads to a bumper year. If you want to eliminate water disasters from the root, you must universally implement ridge fields."
    Now, the Heze Special District is promoting the method of ditch-ridge fields in ten counties, and the Jining Special District is also experimenting with it.

    IV. The Situation of Grain Shortage Has Been Overcome, But Future Work Should Be Strengthened
    A grain shortage occurred in some rural areas of Shandong Province this year. What is the reason for the shortage? In 1954, Shandong's grain output was 26.37 billion jin, the highest output in decades. Calculated on a per capita basis, each person could get 523 jin of grain, which is more than any other year. In the spring, 1.5 billion jin were purchased, and the masses reflected that the purchase method was very good; in the autumn, 1.64 billion jin were purchased, and there should still be more than 23.2 billion jin of grain left in the countryside. Calculated based on Shandong's population of 51 million, each person can still get more than 450 jin of grain. The actual consumption of the highest consumer, the Liaocheng Special District, is 380 jin per person per year, and the lowest consumer, the Linyi Special District, is 342 jin per person per year. The average grain consumption per person per year in the province is 362 jin. This means that each person does not use up 450 jin per year. This proves that Shandong's grain in 1954 still largely exists in the countryside. It also proves that the shortage situation was not caused by a lack of grain, but by serious shortcomings in the grain supply work. For example:
    (1) Shan County: 6,167 supply certificates were issued, of which 575 households were not short of grain. Of course, there were also a few households that were short of grain who were not issued supply certificates.
    (2) Liangshan County: 3,778 supply certificates were issued, but only 2,386 households were truly short of grain. In Jinhe Township, the fifteenth district of the county, 70 out of 84 households requested grain supply, but after checking ten of the households, three were not short of grain. Among them, Wang Juren reported that he was short of 400 jin of grain, but after investigation, his family had 358 jin of wheat, 200 jin of sorghum, and 380 jin of miscellaneous grains. Zhang Xibo, a family of seven, went to the township people's government seven or eight times a day to request supply, but later it was learned that his family had 600 jin of wheat and 750 jin of miscellaneous grains.
    (3) Dongping County: Wang Zhudian, a farmer in Lianhuawan Township, requested a supply of 450 jin of grain. After education, he told the truth: he requested a supply of grain to vent his anger at the village staff. Later, he not only did not request a supply, but also sold 100 jin of grain.
    (4) Liangshan, Yuncheng, and Juye counties: After rectifying the grain unified sales work, 650 households returned their supply certificates, reducing the amount of unified sales grain by 475,000 jin.
    The above are a few examples of areas with relatively tight grain unified sales. In the Laiyang, Jiaozhou, and Wendeng special districts, the grain unified sales situation has always been stable. In areas with tight grain unified sales, after inspection and improvement of supply work, plus the wheat harvest is approaching, the grain supply is no longer a problem. However, the experiences and lessons learned from the inspection provide useful lessons for the further implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in the future. In this regard, I think the following should be noted in the future:
    1. Resolutely implement the "three fixed" measures, and arrange unified sales at the same time as unified purchase; after deducting the grain needed by farmers, calculate the figures for unified purchase and surplus grain, so that the unified purchase work can be done well.
    2. When issuing supply certificates, the application should be carefully reviewed. Those who are truly short of grain must be issued, and those who are not short of grain must not be issued.
    3. Strengthen the socialist education of rural staff and farmers.
    4. Severely punish bad elements who undermine the grain policy and endanger production and public security. For example, the Heze Special District has arrested twelve "local emperors" in recent years. This area is the area with the most reactionary secret societies and Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and also the area with the most and tightest grain supply problems.

### 山东农村所见
王葆真

    迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议
　　山东农村所见
　　全国人民代表大会代表　王葆真
    我在去冬视察了河北省二十五县；今年六月，本着学习的精神，又到山东、河南视察，看到了两省劳动人民和领导工作人员团结在一起创造出的成绩。兹就山东农业生产和粮食工作的发展略述观感如左。
　  一、台田增产，人民生活日益富裕
    高密县西部辛屯乡一带，旧时为百脉湖，潦洼碱地，只能种高粱，每亩产量至多不过百斤；劳动人民在潦洼地创造了台田，每亩就可增收两三倍。但在日寇、蒋匪统治时期，每亩地光租粮就得七十五斤。如农民陈济生家，那时每人每月只能吃八斤粮，最后不得不将十四亩田卖完逃荒。当时台田荒芜甚多。解放后群众修整台田，新造不少，既可防潦洗碱，又可多产棉花。一九五四年辛屯乡每亩平均产量籽棉二百零七斤，比潦洼地产高粱百斤的价值高过十倍。永生农业生产合作社社长、劳动模范刘红岗的水浇棉花每亩产六百斤。
    辛屯乡共有农业生产合作社十五个，参加户数占总农户的百分之八十五强。三个大社（优胜、胜利、永生）的副社长皆为青年妇女。三个社展开生产竞赛，都获得优良成绩。农业社社长陈洪升说：“现在缴公粮，沟坑不算在田亩内；在旧中国就不然，沟坑也缴粮。现在每亩产二百斤籽棉，才缴八斤籽棉，比旧时代缴粮减轻了好几成。”
    七区一个乡长说：大屯村家家都有暖水瓶，男女青年过年节和遇喜庆事都穿卡机布制服、花布衣衫，许多人有胶鞋。乡长、社长、女副社长们都说：若不是共产党、毛主席关怀人民的生活，哪能有今天这样吃得饱，穿得好！
　  二、山区水土保持工作和小型水库保证了粮食增产
    沂水县龙山乡王庄、陈庄一带，历年山水冲沙很多，受灾土地逐年扩大。因此，群众生活极端贫困，常有五、六十户春季出去讨饭，至麦收时才回家。自从共产党和人民政府领导农民闸山沟、修水库后，情况就变了。群众反映：有了毛主席、共产党，才把水闸住了，许多土地不再被淹，淤沙变为良田，不但没有讨饭吃的，去年全乡还卖给国家余粮十八万二千斤。今年春旱，但因用水库的水浇地，每亩仍收麦二百斤。
    沂水县许多乡的水利建设同龙山乡情况相似。全县闸山沟六千五百道，民办缓水坝一千九百八十六道，群众自修坝五万四千三百二十一道（座），淤出土地七千多亩，整梯田二百二十三万七千道，自修小型蓄水池五座，公办小型水库五座，造林三十三万亩，要求在第一个五年计划中，全县五十万亩荒山完全绿化。
    但是，不止沂水县如此。据统计，全省闸了十五万二千道山沟，修建了四万八千九百多个蓄水池，共使一千七百四十一万亩地免除了涝灾，八百二十万亩地免除了旱灾。可见这些水利建设对粮食增产起了多么大的作用。
    水利工作的发展也推动了农业合作化事业的发展。沂水县松峰乡中苏友好农业生产合作社利用太平官庄水库浇地，获得丰产，社亦扩大。社长刘连升说：“我们的社在一九五四年组成，当时只有十八户。建社前有十二个缺粮户。这十二户入社后，除四户需供应粮二百二十斤外，其余八户还卖了余粮一千八百斤。今年我们社扩大到五十一户。去年我们的早秋作物每亩平均收二百四十斤，互助组的收一百七十斤，单干户的收九十斤。正是因为群众亲眼看到社的优越性和好处，我们的社才扩大起来的。去年有水浇地，谷子每亩收了六百四十八斤，一般浇地种谷收了三百四十斤，不浇的才收一百三十斤。玉米用水浇和施肥的每亩收了八百斤，没浇的才收一百斤。我们社的社员收了粮食，都积极地把粮食卖给国家。若没有政府修好水库，我们社就不能浇地，也得不到丰产。我们衷心地感谢毛主席对人民生活的关怀，我们坚决地拥护粮食统购统销政策。”
　  三、大水洼变成粮食囤
    郓城县东北十二连洼，向来水淹面积二万多亩，党和政府领导农民在一九五二至一九五四年挖了大量的蓄水沟、截水沟、引水渠，并修造了面积为四百六十五亩的蓄水塘。一九五四年这一带获得了大丰收。在十二连洼改造成功的影响下，郓城西北三十里的侯集大洼（约有十三万亩的面积），也被群众自动地改造为沟洫畦田，去年这地方也获得了向来未有的丰收。群众反映说，大水洼变成了粮食囤。并有一歌谣：“共产党办法全，挖沟蓄水成丰年，要想水灾从根除，还得普遍搞畦田。”
    现在，菏泽专区正在十个县内推广沟洫畦田的办法，济宁专区也在试验中。
    四、粮食紧张的情况克服了，但应加强今后的工作
    山东省某些农村今年曾一度发生粮食紧张情况。紧张的原因何在？一九五四年山东粮食产量二百六十三亿七千万斤，为几十年来产量最高的一年。按人口平均计算，每人可得粮五百二十三斤，比任何年都多。春季收购十五亿斤，群众反映收购办法很好；秋季收购十六亿四千万斤，还应该有二百三十二亿多斤粮食留在农村。按山东人口五千一百万计算，平均每人还可得粮食四百五十多斤。实际消费量最高者为聊城专区，每人每年是三百八十斤，最低者为临沂专区，每人每年是三百四十二斤。全省平均每人每年消费粮食量为三百六十二斤。这就是说，每人每年都用不了四百五十斤。由此证明山东
  一九五四年的粮食尚有很大部分存在农村。也就证明并非因为粮食缺少造成紧张的情况，而是由于粮食供应工作中存在严重缺点。例如：
      （一）单县：发出六千一百六十七户供应证，内有五百七十五户并不缺粮。当然，也有少数缺粮户漏发供应证。
      （二）梁山县：发出供应证三千七百七十八户，真缺粮的只有二千三百八十六户。该县十五区锦合乡八十四户，要求供应粮食的就有七十户，但经过检查的十户中，就有三户不缺粮。其中，王菊人自报缺粮四百斤，经了解的结果，他家还有小麦三百五十八斤，高粱二百斤，杂粮三百八十斤。张希伯，七口人，每天到乡人民政府七、八次，要求供应，但后来了解他家存小麦六百斤，杂粮七百五十斤。
      （三）东平县：莲花湾乡农民王祝典要求供应四百五十斤粮，经过教育后，他说了实话：他要求供应粮食，是为了同村工作人员斗气。后来，他不但不要求供应，还卖出百斤粮。
    （四）梁山、郓城、钜野三县：经过整顿粮食统销工作后，退回供应证的有六百五十户，共减少统销粮数四十七万五千斤。
    以上是粮食统销较为紧张的地区的几个例子。而在莱阳、胶州、文登三个专区，粮食统销情况是始终稳定的。在粮食统销紧张的地区，经过检查，和改进供应工作，再加麦秋又屆，所以粮食供应已不成问题。但检查中得出的经验教训，则为今后粮食统购统销政策的进一步贯彻提供了有益的借鉴。在这方面，我觉得今后应该注意的是：
    一、坚决贯彻“三定”的措施，在统购同时即布置统销；扣除农家需要的粮食之后，计算统购和余粮的数字，这样就可作好统购工作。
    二、在发给供应证时，应认真审查。对真缺粮者必发，不缺粮者必不发。
    三、加强对农村工作人员和农民的社会主义的教育。
    四、对破坏粮食政策和妨害生产、治安的坏分子严加惩治。如菏泽专区近年曾逮捕了十二个土皇帝。这个地区为反动会道门、蒋匪特务最多的区域，亦即为粮食供应问题最多，最紧张的区域。
