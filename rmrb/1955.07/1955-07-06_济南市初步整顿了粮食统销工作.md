　　Jinan Municipality Initially Rectified Grain Unified Sales Work
　　By Qí Xiàngcén, Deputy Mayor of Jinan Municipality
    For the past two years, Jinan Municipality has implemented planned grain supply and has achieved some initial results. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, we have not regularly and deeply carried out propaganda and education on the unified purchase and sale policy, grain conservation, and obedience to state plans among the people of the city. Our control over grain supply work was too lax, and many supplies that should not have been provided were provided, causing the state to waste a lot of grain. In particular, since October of last year, grain sales have increased month by month. The city's sales volume in the fourth quarter increased by 4.77 million jin compared to the third quarter, and from January to April this year, it increased by 11.82 percent compared to the same period last year, more than double the rate of population growth. This phenomenon is obviously very unreasonable.
    What are the problems in Jinan Municipality's grain unified sales work?
    First of all, grain consumption plans from all sectors are generally too high. There is a phenomenon of government organizations and groups in the urban area falsely reporting the number of people eating grain and purchasing more grain. Many collective catering units plan for grain consumption far exceeding actual needs. Because they buy more grain, they eat less, and some units even have "small stockpiles." It is even more common among residents to reduce the population without reducing the grain consumption plan. Some people have even died, and their families still buy their share of grain as usual. There are also many residents who store grain. For example, in one residential group in the Fifth District, all eleven households have stored grain, with some storing more than 300 jin. Among residents in the suburbs, the phenomenon of reporting a shortage when there is no shortage, or reporting more of a shortage than there actually is, is quite serious. According to a survey of five townships in the suburbs, in June, 1,131 households reported a grain shortage, requesting a total of 146,691 jin of grain. Among them, 903 households reported a shortage when there was no shortage or reported more of a shortage than there actually was, requesting 81,142 jin more grain than actually needed, more than double the actual need. There are also many grain-using industries that conceal inventories and purchase more grain. An inspection of 38 households revealed that 19 households had concealed 4,845 jin of stored grain.
    Secondly, the phenomenon of wasting grain is quite serious. Leftover rice and steamed buns are thrown away in the canteens, offices, dormitories, and even toilets of many units. Cadre sanatoriums in the suburbs often throw away cooked food, causing dissatisfaction among local farmers. The phenomenon of wasting grain is even more serious in grain-using industries. In 1954, private major ranches wasted approximately 200,000 jin of feed grain.
    Thirdly, due to high supply quotas and lax management, grain flows back to the countryside, and unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to resell and transport it. Approximately 6.5 million jin of cooked food and pastries flow out of the city each year, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total grain used by the cooked food and food industries. At the same time, due to the loose grain supply in the city, a large number of rural people flow into the city, further increasing the city's grain sales volume.
    Fourthly, grain management is poor, lacking investigation and research. There is insufficient understanding of the actual consumption level of various supply recipients, the reasonable needs of various grain-using industries, and the normal consumption patterns of society. Approving plans is done blindly. For example, the average per capita supply for government organizations and groups in April of this year increased by 8.24 percent compared to the initial stage of unified sales. The supply for general residents (including industrial and commercial households with fewer than 30 people) averaged 27.8 jin per person per month in the third quarter of last year, increasing to 28.6 jin in the fourth quarter, and further increasing to 29.5 jin in the first quarter of this year. The supply for the cooked food, food, and non-staple food industries from January to April this year also increased by 18.93 percent compared to the same period last year. We did not pay timely attention to studying and correcting these over-quota supplies, resulting in the continuous increase in the city's grain sales volume.
    In order to quickly change this situation, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on stepping up the rectification of grain unified sales work, Jinan Municipality has initially rectified grain unified sales work since May of this year, and the city's grain sales volume has decreased to some extent. The city's total sales volume in May decreased by 2.1 million jin compared to April, and the planned number for June decreased by another 2.02 million jin compared to May, a decrease of 14.3 percent compared to the actual sales volume in April. This fact powerfully proves that Jinan Municipality's past grain sales volume was extremely unreasonable. As long as we resolutely implement the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, not only can the situation of continuous growth in grain sales volume be reversed, but also the original planned supply quotas can be reduced.
    Jinan Municipality's specific approach to rectifying grain unified sales work is based on the "Resolution on Further Strengthening Grain Unified Sales Work" of the Second Session of the Jinan Municipal People's Congress. Through summarizing the unified sales work, a large-scale and in-depth ideological mobilization work is carried out among the people of the city. In propaganda work, the advantages of implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the great significance of saving grain are emphasized to the masses. The state's methods of guaranteeing reasonable needs for grain supply are clearly explained to the masses, eliminating some of the concerns of the masses. At the same time, key inspections are organized by type, seizing the main link of "verifying the population and verifying the plan," mobilizing the masses to check and plug the loopholes of wasting grain, and resolutely fighting against all kinds of bad behaviors of falsely reporting, fraudulently claiming, and wasting grain. From June, all government organizations, enterprises, and groups in the city further implemented a strict grain budget system. The city's grain consumption plan for government organizations and groups in June decreased by 1.12 million jin compared to May. From the initial inspection, the current grain supply for government organizations and groups can continue to be reduced. According to the calculation of the current number of people eating in the canteen of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the average per capita grain requirement is 28.11 jin per month. After further improving canteen management and practicing strict grain conservation, the average per capita can be no more than 27 jin per month.
    After propaganda and education and key inspections, under the leadership of cadres and activists, residents throughout the city have calculated detailed accounts and made living plans. In June, a total of 31,246 households reduced their grain consumption plans, reducing grain consumption by more than 850,000 jin compared to May, an average reduction of 1.92 jin per person. In addition, we have strengthened the management of the urban population. Rural people who have lived in the city for a long time without formal employment have been educated and mobilized to return to their hometowns to engage in production.
    On the premise of ensuring market needs and taking care of the business of businesses, the grain supply for the catering and reproduction industries has been initially reduced, and the outflow of raw grain and cooked food has been strictly controlled, and speculation and trafficking have been banned. Illegal merchants who illegally purchased and speculated in grain were dealt with according to the law, depending on the circumstances. For ranch feed and industrial grain, on the one hand, attention is paid to reasonable supply, and on the other hand, the use of substitutes is promoted. It is estimated that using wheat bran to make soy sauce and using two-thirds of white clay to make paste, the city can save 1.44 million jin of industrial grain throughout the year. In May, the use of white clay alone saved more than 26,900 jin of grain.
    After this rectification of grain unified sales work, in addition to initially improving the grain supply system, the grain departments of Jinan Municipality also paid attention to improving the output rate of grain processing and eliminating all waste phenomena such as mildew, insect damage, and spillage in the process of grain storage, transportation, and sales.
    According to preliminary calculations, Jinan Municipality's grain sales volume for the next year (July 1955 to June 1956) can still be compressed. We are continuing to carry out in-depth propaganda and education work to the broad masses of citizens based on the problems exposed in the rectification of unified sales work, further strengthening grain planning management, improving the supply system, banning grain speculation and trafficking, earnestly plugging all loopholes in wasting grain, and actively studying and promoting the experience and methods of saving grain to ensure that the city's grain unified sales work is done well.

### 济南市初步整顿了粮食统销工作

　　济南市初步整顿了粮食统销工作
　　济南市副市长　亓象岑
    两年来，济南市实行粮食计划供应，初步取得了一些成绩。但由于我们对实行粮食统购统销政策的艰巨性、复杂性认识不足，没有经常深入地向全市人民进行统购统销政策、节约粮食和服从国家计划的宣传教育，对粮食供应工作掌握偏松，许多不应该供应的也供应了，使国家浪费了很多粮食。特别自去年十月以来粮食销量逐月上涨，第四季度全市销售量较第三季度增加四百七十七万斤，今年一至四月份较去年同期增加了百分之十一点八二，超过人口增加速度的一倍以上。这种现象显然是极不合理的。
    济南市的粮食统销工作中有哪些问题呢？
    首先是各方面的用粮计划普遍偏高。城区机关团体有虚报吃粮人数，多购粮食的现象。许多集体伙食单位计划用粮数远远超过实际需要数，由于买的粮食多，实际吃的少，有些单位还有“小库存”。居民中间减少了人口不减用粮计划的现象更是普遍，甚至有的人已死去，其家属仍照常买他的一份粮食。居民中存粮的人也不少，如第五区一个居民小组十一户家家有存粮，多的存到三百斤以上。在郊区居民中间，不缺报缺、缺少报多的现象相当严重。据郊区五个乡调查，六月份报缺粮的一千一百三十一户，共计要粮十四万六千六百九十一斤，其中不缺报缺和缺少报多的有九百零三户，多报粮食八万一千一百四十二斤，超过实需数一倍以上。用粮行业匿报库存、多购粮食的也很多。检查了三十八户就发现有十九户匿报存粮四千八百四十五斤。
    其次，浪费粮食的现象相当严重。许多单位的食堂、办公室、宿舍甚至厕所里都扔有剩饭馒头。郊区的干部休养所经常抛扔熟食，引起当地农民的不满。用粮行业浪费粮食的现象更为严重，一九五四年私营五大牧场浪费的饲料粮约计二十多万斤。
    第三，由于供应指标偏高和管理不严，使得粮食向农村倒流，奸商乘机倒卖贩运。全市熟食、糕点每年外流约计六百五十万斤左右，占熟食、食品行业用粮总数的百分之二十以上。同时由于城市粮食供应偏松，农村人口就大量流入城市，更增加了城市的粮食销售量。
    第四，粮食管理工作不善，缺乏调查研究，对各种供应对象的实际消费水平、各类用粮行业的合理需要和社会正常的消费规律了解不够，审批计划有盲目性。如机关团体今年四月每人平均供应量比统销初期增加了百分之八点二四。一般居民（包括三十人以下的工商业户）的供应量去年第三季度每人每月平均二十七点八斤，第四季度增至二十八点六斤，今年第一季度又增加到二十九点五斤。熟食、食品、副食品行业今年一至四月份的供应量也较去年同期增加百分之十八点九三。对这些超指标的供应，我们没有及时注意研究纠正，以致全市粮食销售量不断上涨。
    为了迅速改变这种状况，根据国务院和中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示，济南市从今年五月起对粮食统销工作初步进行了整顿，全市粮食销售量已有所下降。五月份全市总销售量较四月份减少了二百一十万斤，六月份计划数又较五月份减少二百零二万斤，较四月份实销数减少百分之十四点三。这个事实有力地证明，济南市过去粮食销量极不合理，只要我们坚决贯彻国务院和中共中央的指示，不仅粮食销售量不断增长的状况可以扭转，而且原来的计划供应指标还可以降低。
    济南市整顿粮食统销工作的具体作法，是根据市人民代表大会第二次会议“关于进一步加强粮食统销工作的决议”，通过总结统销工作，在全市人民中间大张旗鼓地进行深入的思想动员工作。在宣传工作中向群众着重说明了实行粮食统购统销政策的好处和节约粮食的重大意义，向群众明确交代了国家保证合理需要的粮食供应办法，消除了群众中的一些顾虑。同时，按类型组织了重点检查，抓住“查实人口、核实计划”这一主要环节，发动群众检查和堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞，坚决向一切虚报冒领浪费粮食的恶劣行为进行斗争。从六月份起，全市各机关、企业、团体进一步实行了严格的粮食预决算制度，六月份全市机关团体用粮计划较五月份即减少了一百一十二万斤。从初步检查的情况看，机关团体当前粮食供应量还可以继续减低。中共济南市委机关按照现有起伙人员计算，平均每人每月需粮二十八点一一斤，进一步改善伙食管理厉行节约粮食以后，平均每人每月可以不超过二十七斤。
    经过宣传教育和重点检查以后，全市居民在干部和积极分子的带动下，纷纷算细账、打生活谱，六月份居民缩减用粮计划的共三万一千二百四十六户，较五月份减少用粮八十五万多斤，每人平均减少一点九二斤。此外，我们还加强了对城市人口的管理；对久居城市又无正式职业的农村人口，已通过教育，动员他们回乡生产。
    在保证市场需要和照顾业户经营的前提下，初步缩减了对饮食、复制行业的粮食供应量，并严格控制生粮、熟食外流，取缔投机贩运。对违法套购、投机贩运粮食的不法商人，分别情况，依法进行了处理。对牧场饲料和工业用粮，一方面注意合理供应，一方面提倡使用代用品。据估计，用麸皮作酱油和用三分之二的白黏土制浆糊，全市全年即可节省工业用粮一百四十四万斤，五月份光使用白黏土一项即节省粮食二万六千九百多斤。
    这次整顿粮食统销工作以后，济南市粮食部门除初步健全了粮食供应制度以外，同时还注意了提高粮食加工的出品率，消除粮食在保管、调运、销售过程中的霉烂、虫蚀、抛撒等一切浪费现象。
    根据初步计算，济南市下一年度（一九五五年七月至一九五六年六月）的粮食销售量还可以压缩。我们正根据从整顿统销工作中暴露出来的问题，继续向广大市民进行深入的宣传教育工作，进
  一步加强粮食计划管理，健全供应制度，取缔粮食投机贩运，切实堵塞各种浪费粮食的漏洞，并积极研究推广节约粮食的经验和办法，保证作好全市的粮食统销工作。
