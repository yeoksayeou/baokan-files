Xinhua News Agency, July 8th—Our reporter today visited the Chinese Red Cross to inquire about when the former United Nations American soldiers Griggs, Bell, and Colwart would leave China. A spokesman for the association told reporters that after learning from the Indian Red Cross that the US authorities had allowed these three American soldiers to return home, the association applied to the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing on July 1st for transit visas for them to pass through Hong Kong. At the time, officials from the British Chargé d'Affaires indicated that they believed they would receive a response from the Hong Kong authorities within a few days. In order to enable them to leave China as soon as possible, the association also made specific arrangements, planning to send someone to the border to escort them on July 9th and telegraph the Indian Red Cross, requesting the British Red Cross in Hong Kong to send someone to receive them at the border. However, as of 6:00 PM today (August 8th), no response had been received from the Hong Kong authorities, so they had to postpone their departure from China. The Chinese Red Cross has telegraphed the Indian Red Cross and the British Red Cross in Hong Kong tonight to explain the situation and cancel the originally scheduled date for Griggs and the other two to arrive at the border. Griggs and the other two are now waiting in Guangzhou for transit permission from the Hong Kong authorities.

　　我国红十字会发言人说
　　三名美籍士兵等候去香港
    新华社八日讯　本社记者今天就前联合国军美籍士兵格里格斯、贝尔和科华特三人将在何时离开中国，走访中国红十字会。该会发言人告诉记者说，该会从印度红十字会获悉美国当局已允许这三名美籍士兵回国后，即在七月一日向驻北京的英国代办处为他们办理在香港过境的手续。当时据英国代办处官员表示，相信几天之内即可获得香港当局的答复。为了使他们能够尽早离开中国，该会同时作了具体安排，预定在七月九日派人将他们送到边境，并电告印度红十字会，请香港英国红十字会届时派人在边境接待。但是，截至今天（八日）下午六时，还没有获得香港当局的答复，因此他们不得不延期离开中国。中国红十字会已在今晚分别电告印度红十字会和香港英国红十字会说明情况，取消原定的格里格斯等三人到达边境的日期。格里格斯等三人现在正在广州等候香港当局的过境许可。
