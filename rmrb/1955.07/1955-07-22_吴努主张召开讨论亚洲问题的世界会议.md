Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, who is currently visiting Japan, said at a press conference in Tokyo on the 20th that "holding a world conference of all countries related to Asia would be a good thing." He believes that the tense situation in the Taiwan area and the Indochina issue should be the most important items on the agenda of such a conference. He said that he had discussed the possibility of holding such a conference during his visits abroad. He will immediately exchange views with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the matter of convening such a conference after returning home.
U Nu said that he believes the People's Republic of China should attend any world conference on Asian issues and should also be admitted to the United Nations. He went on to say, "Two Chinas - that is completely impossible."
In response to a question about the recent fighting in Laos, U Nu said that the fighting itself is not very dangerous, but it could become very dangerous if foreign countries intervene.

    吴努主张召开讨论亚洲问题的世界会议
    新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：正在日本访问的缅甸总理吴努，二十日在东京的记者招待会上说，“举行一次和亚洲有关的所有国家的世界会议将是一桩好事情。”他认为台湾地区紧张局势问题和印度支那问题应该是这种会议的议程上最重要的项目。他说，他在国外访问期间讨论了举行这种会议的可能性。他在回国后将立刻就召开这种会议一事和印度总理尼赫鲁交换意见。
    吴努说，他认为中华人民共和国应该出席任何有关亚洲问题的世界会议，并且还应该被接纳进入联合国。他接着说，“两个中国——这是完全不可能的。”
    在答复对老挝最近发生的战事的意见时，吴努说，这次战事本身并不很危险，但是如果有外国插身干涉的话，那它就可能成为很危险的事。
