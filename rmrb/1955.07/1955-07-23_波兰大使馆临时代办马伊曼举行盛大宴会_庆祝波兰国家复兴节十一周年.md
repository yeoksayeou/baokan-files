Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Polish People's Republic Chargé d'Affaires to China, Maiman, held a grand banquet on the evening of the 22nd to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the Polish National Rebirth Day. Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, said at the banquet tonight that the Four-Power Summit currently being held in Geneva brings new hope for further easing international tensions, and he hopes that this meeting will achieve positive results in resolving major international issues.

Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai at the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council Peng Dehuai and Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Saifudin, members of the Standing Committee, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, heads of various ministries and commissions, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, heads of various people's organizations, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the banquet.

After the banquet began, Polish People's Republic Chargé d'Affaires to China, Maiman, spoke first. After talking about the great achievements made by the Polish people in their construction endeavors, he also talked about the great contributions made by the Polish people to the cause of world peace. He said that the foreign policy of People's Poland is a policy of peace. Poland's participation in the Warsaw Conference is a manifestation of our peaceful intentions and a guarantee of our security. We actively participate in the work of the United Nations, where we advocate defending peace and resolving international disputes peacefully. This kind of policy is reflected in our participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Control and Supervisory Commissions in Indochina. A powerful expression of our peaceful intentions is our construction; we will victoriously complete the Six-Year Plan this year. Yesterday, on the eve of our holiday, the handover ceremony of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, as a gift from the Soviet Union and a symbol of Soviet-Polish friendship, was held.

Maiman said that our relationship with the People's Republic of China is a friendly and fraternal relationship. This relationship is manifested in the ever-increasing economic and cultural exchanges and the common struggle to consolidate peace. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's statement at the Warsaw Conference that if these friendly countries are subjected to aggression, the great Chinese people with a population of 600 million will provide assistance, received a warm response from the Polish people. The Polish people speak with great respect of the great political and economic achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in successfully implementing the first Five-Year Plan.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke. He said that in the short span of eleven years, the Polish people have victoriously completed the Three-Year Plan for the restoration of the national economy and are about to victoriously complete the Six-Year Plan for laying the foundations of socialism. The national face of Poland has undergone a fundamental change, and Poland has transformed from an agricultural country into a socialist industrial country with enormous economic potential.

Talking about the increasingly important role played by the Polish people in the cause of safeguarding world peace, he said that the unremitting efforts made by the Polish people to maintain European peace and establish a European collective security system, to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and to implement the Geneva Accords have won the sincere admiration and warm support of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that, thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, India, and other peace-loving countries and peoples, the recent international situation has eased to a certain extent. The Four-Power Summit is being held in Geneva, which brings new hope for further easing international tensions. The Chinese people and the people of the world warmly welcome this meeting and hope that this meeting will achieve positive results in resolving major international issues.

Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples have developed in an all-round way, which is of great significance for maintaining world peace, strengthening the socialist construction of our two countries, and enhancing the welfare of the two peoples. The Chinese people cherish this fraternal friendship very much and will make every effort to continuously consolidate and develop it.

After the banquet, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe and Polish artists performed wonderful music and acrobatics programs.
