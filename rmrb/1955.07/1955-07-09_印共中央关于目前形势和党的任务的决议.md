Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th: The Central Committee meeting of the Communist Party of India, held in Delhi in June, passed a resolution on the current situation and the party's tasks.

　　The resolution stated, "The struggle for peace has become the central issue of today's world politics and a task of decisive significance for all countries. This struggle is extremely closely related to the struggle to defend national independence and democracy."

　　The resolution pointed out, "Today, India's foreign policy is largely opposed to imperialist war activities and contributes to the cause of world peace. Its work in maintaining Asian solidarity is generally opposed to colonialism. It is establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries."

　　The resolution stated, "Of great historical significance is the statement by Nehru and Zhou Enlai on June 28, 1954—the Five Principles. It has become a powerful factor in the struggle of the people of Asian countries for unity, peace, and freedom.

　　"Since then, this orientation in India's foreign policy has seen further development.

　　"The Bandung Conference, with India as one of the main initiators, became a conference of Asian solidarity and opposition to colonialism, giving another blow to the imperialist war plans.

　　"The friendship between the Indian people and the Soviet people has been further strengthened by the Indian Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union. The joint statement issued by Jawaharlal Nehru and N.A. Bulganin is a document of far-reaching international significance and a major contribution to the cause of peace and friendship among nations. The assessment of the international situation in the statement and the principles it put forward further isolated the instigators of war and were therefore welcomed by all peace-loving humanity."

　　The resolution stated, "Due to the adoption of this approach in foreign policy, India has been playing a great role in the world-scale struggle to maintain peace—a role that has enhanced India's international prestige and inspired national pride in the heart of every patriotic Indian."

　　The resolution stated, "The Communist Party, which has been fighting for a consistent policy of peace, welcomes and supports this approach and will strive to further strengthen it." The resolution stated, "The Communist Party will work for the conclusion of treaties of friendship and cooperation between India and all other peace-loving countries; it will work to ensure that the Indian government takes a firm stand against imperialism, especially British imperialism, in waging colonial wars in Asia and Africa; it will mobilize the masses to support India's greater trade and greater cultural and social exchanges with socialist countries, and to support the overall strengthening of Asian solidarity against imperialist countries."

　　The resolution said, referring to the domestic situation, "The tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism remain to be completed."

　　The resolution announced that the Communist Party of India supports the suggestions in the outline of India's Second Five-Year Plan regarding the establishment of basic industries. Once these suggestions are realized, they will reduce India's dependence on foreign countries for capital goods, thereby strengthening India's economic position and national independence. The Communist Party of India also advocates that these industries should be mainly publicly owned. The resolution welcomes the establishment of steel plants in India in cooperation with the Soviet Union.

　　The resolution stated, "The tendency not to participate in plans and construction projects initiated or sponsored by the government must be terminated. We must actively and effectively participate in these plans and construction projects, fight against corruption, inefficiency, and bureaucracy, and assist in their implementation and management so that the people receive the greatest benefit."

　　The resolution stated, "Every step that is unfavorable to foreign capital, opposes feudal and semi-feudal land relations, and restricts monopoly capital will be met with our warmest and unlimited support."

　　The resolution believes that "it is necessary to take bold action against British capital and the landlord system, to restrict monopoly capital, to improve the people's living conditions, and to implement democratic measures." The resolution stated, "A complete people's plan can only be built on the basis of confiscating British capital and distributing land to the tillers without compensation."

　　印共中央关于目前形势和党的任务的决议
    新华社新德里八日电　六月间在德里举行的印度共产党中央委员会会议，通过了关于目前形势和党的任务的决议。
    决议说，“争取和平的斗争已经成为今日世界政治的中心问题和对一切国家具有决定意义的任务。这一斗争同保卫民族独立和民主的斗争具有极其密切的关系。”
    决议指出，“今天，印度的外交政策大体上是反对帝国主义战争活动和有助于世界和平事业的。它维护亚洲团结的事业，一般地是反对殖民主义的。它正在同苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家建立友好关系。”
    决议说，“具有重大历史意义的是一九五四年六月二十八日尼赫鲁和周恩来的声明——五项原则。它成了亚洲各国人民争取团结、争取和平和自由的斗争中的一个有力因素。
    “自从那时以来，印度外交政策方面的这种方针有了进一步的发展。
      “由印度担任主要发起国之一的万隆会议成了亚洲团结和反对殖民主义的大会，它给予帝国主义的战争计划以另一次打击。
    “印度人民同苏联人民的友谊，由于印度总理这次对苏联的访问而进一步加强了。贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁和尼·亚·布尔加宁所发表的联合声明是一个具有深远国际意义的文件，是对和平和各国友好的事业的重大贡献。声明中对国际局势所作的估计和它所提出的原则进一步孤立了战争挑拨者，因而受到全体爱好和平人类的欢迎。”
    决议说，“由于在外交政策方面采取了这种方针，印度在维护和平的世界规模的斗争中一直起着伟大的作用——这种作用提高了印度的国际威望，并在每一个爱国的印度人心中激发了民族自豪感。”
    决议说，“一直为一贯的和平政策而进行斗争的共产党欢迎并支持这一方针，并将努力进一步加强它。”决议说，“共产党将为印度同所有其他爱好和平的国家缔结友好合作条约而努力；它将为使印度政府采取坚决的反对帝国主义，特别是英帝国主义在亚洲和非洲进行殖民战争的立场而努力；它将动员群众支持印度同社会主义国家进行更多的贸易和更大的文化和社会交流，支持全面加强亚洲反对帝国主义国家的团结。”
    决议在谈到国内情况时说，“反帝反封建的任务尚有待完成。”
    决议宣布，印度共产党支持印度第二个五年计划大纲中关于建立基本工业的建议。这种建议一旦实现，就将减少印度在资本货物方面对外国的依赖，从而加强印度的经济地位和民族独立。印度共产党并主张这些工业主要应该是公营的。决议欢迎在与苏联合作的情况下在印度建立钢铁厂。
    决议说，“不参与政府所发起的或主办的计划和建设工程的倾向必须终止。我们必须积极和有效地参加这些计划和建设工程，同腐化、没有效率和官僚主义现象作斗争，协助实现和管理它们以便使人民得到最大的好处。”
    决议说，“每一项不利于外国资本、反对封建的和半封建的土地关系、限制垄断资本的步骤，都将受到我们最热烈的和无限的拥护。”
    决议认为，“有必要采取反对英国资本和地主制度的果敢行动，限制垄断资本，改善人民生活状况，实行民主措施。”决议说，“完备的人民的计划只能建立在没收英国资本和无偿地把土地分给耕种者的基础上。”
