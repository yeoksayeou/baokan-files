    This newspaper reports that the decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to approve the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng in accordance with the Constitution has been unanimously supported by people from all walks of life in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Wuhan.
    The coking department, transportation department, and foundry department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing held a forum on the 18th. Tian Shutang, a worker at the factory and a Beijing labor model, Cheng Degui, and Liu Jinghua, foreman of a blast furnace shift in the iron smelting department, said: We are working hard to produce steel and iron and engage in socialist construction, but counter-revolutionaries like Pan Hannian and Hu Feng have sneaked into our ranks to carry out sabotage. We must eliminate all counter-revolutionaries and defend our socialist construction. Chen Daisun, the head of the Economics Department of Peking University, said: "From the cases of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, we can see that the current struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries is completely necessary. At the same time, we can also see that as long as we are vigilant, no matter how cunning a counter-revolutionary is, he will eventually escape the people's law." Sun Fuling, Li Yizan, and other thirteen members of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce unanimously believe that the capture of hidden counter-revolutionaries such as Pan Hannian and Hu Feng marks the failure of the shameful conspiracies of imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and a major victory for the revolutionary people. On behalf of all the staff of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, they demanded that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng.
    The heads of the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Tianjin, as well as people from education, medical, minority, and religious circles, have all made speeches. They unanimously believe that the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is a timely, correct, and wise measure. Mu Zifang, a representative of the minority nationalities, pointed out that these two counter-revolutionaries are the common enemies of all nationalities in the country, and removing them from their positions as representatives and trying them according to law is the unanimous demand of all nationalities. Zheng Xisan, chairman of the Tianjin Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Christianity, said: Patriotic religious believers should also be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries who are cloaked in religious garb, learn to recognize their true nature, ruthlessly strip away their disguises, and cleanse them from the religious community.
    The heads of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing have successively made speeches, and many workers, peasants, and office workers have held forums or written letters to local newspapers, expressing their firm support for this wise measure of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. All the staff of the Chongqing Power Plant unanimously demanded that the counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng be severely punished according to law, and expressed that they would heighten their vigilance and eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries. Zheng Xianghui, a representative of the Chongqing Municipal People's Congress and director of the Xinli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinjiagang Township, said: "We must further heighten our vigilance and not allow a single bad element to sneak into the agricultural production cooperative."
    Workers and staff of the Dahua Textile Factory and other units in Xi'an held forums. Zhao Chengdu, a national labor model in the textile industry, said at the forum:
  "The People's Government's arrest and trial of the counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng in accordance with the law meets the demands of the people of the whole country. Although counter-revolutionaries are ubiquitous and do all kinds of evil, as long as the people of the whole country heighten their vigilance, we can eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries." All the staff of the Xi'an branch of the Chinese Writers Association sent a telegram to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, supporting the measures taken by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to approve the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, and expressed that they would further enhance revolutionary vigilance and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.
    People from all walks of life in Wuhan support the arrest and trial of counter-revolutionaries Pan Hannian and Hu Feng. Wu Xinpu and others, workers at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site, stated that in order to successfully complete the socialist construction tasks, it is necessary to resolutely punish counter-revolutionaries such as Pan Hannian and Hu Feng in accordance with the law. Tang Wuyuan, chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, emphasized: "The exposure of Pan Hannian and Hu Feng, two counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary organization, is another victory in the revolutionary cause led by the Communist Party and the people. Democratic figures must be a hundred times more vigilant and advance under the leadership of the Communist Party."
