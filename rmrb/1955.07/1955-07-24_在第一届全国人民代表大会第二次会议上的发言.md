**Speech by Representative Xi Rao Jia Cuo**

I fully agree with and support the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of our country and the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuqun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will strive to implement these in my future work.

The First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development is a grand plan formulated under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, based on the overall tasks of the transitional period. The total expenditure of the state on this plan is equivalent to approximately 70 million taels of gold. "To use such a large amount of funds for national construction is unimaginable in China's past history. Only a government led by the working class, which works wholeheartedly for the people's interests, can do this." The completion of this plan will greatly change the backward economic face of our country and create immense happiness for the people of the nation and future generations. If we continue to build like this for several decades, our country can catch up with or even surpass the industrial level of capitalist countries. Such a rapid pace can only be achieved under the leadership of the working class; this is the greatness of the working class.

This plan fully considers the interests of ethnic minorities. It implements regional autonomy for ethnic minorities as stipulated in the Constitution, and develops the economy, culture, education, health, and medical services of various ethnic groups. For example, it provides financial and technical support to the extent possible for the development of livestock farming in ethnic minority areas; it builds railways and highways in ethnic minority areas; it develops schools, publications, broadcasting, films, and cultural activities for ethnic minorities; and it increases the supply of industrial products and agricultural production materials suitable for ethnic minorities. Additionally, it appropriately distributes industrial areas to change the concentration of industry in coastal cities, gradually improving the economic level of backward regions. This will have a significant impact on the development of resources in ethnic minority regions. The Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province is rich in underground resources, a treasure trove for all ethnic groups in the motherland. Its development is beneficial to the overall national construction. The people of Qinghai will do their best to support the state's large-scale development in this region.

The source of our socialist state's construction funds can only rely on domestic accumulation. To this end, we must oppose waste and practice thrift to accumulate funds. This has been proven effective in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. The State Council's proposal to save 2 billion yuan in the last three years of the Five-Year Plan and its call are extremely wise and correct. We must seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on thrift, effectively establish a thrift system, truly learn the methods of thrift, and launch a continuous nationwide thrift movement to fight against all wasteful practices. At the same time, we should advocate for simplicity in life, avoid extravagance, learn from the Soviet people's past hard work in construction, and carry forward our country's excellent tradition of diligence and thrift. We should use the fruits of construction mainly to expand national construction, especially heavy industry construction.

Due to the good implementation of our construction plan, domestic and foreign enemies have launched various forms of crazy sabotage. Recently, in some pastoral areas, rumors have been spread by the enemy that "establishing cooperatives in pastoral areas is a disguised form of public ownership of cattle and sheep," affecting the production enthusiasm of herdsmen. My view is that cooperatives are established based on local actual conditions, organizing scattered herdsmen appropriately to improve grazing techniques, increase the production of their own cattle and sheep, and lead to a more prosperous and happy life. Similarly, this reform issue is decided by the ethnic minorities themselves. Chairman Liu Shaoqi clearly pointed out that the issue of socialist transformation should allow ethnic minorities to take a relatively long time to consider carefully and decide according to their own wishes. Vice Premier Li Fuqun also clearly pointed out in his report: "The socialist transformation of various ethnic minorities should be based on the characteristics of the historical development of the ethnic group and respect the will of the people." These have made the issue of socialist transformation in ethnic minority areas very clear. The people of the pastoral areas should distinguish right from wrong and smash all rumors that disrupt their production.

There are also many counterrevolutionaries who use religion to carry out sabotage, which is often found in ethnic minority areas. For example, in some pastoral areas of Qinghai, rumors spread that a divine book had descended, saying that the world was about to be destroyed and the people would suffer great disasters. This is a demon disguised as Buddhism, with no trace of true religious spirit. However, generally, those who believe in religion but lack wisdom are deceived by the superstition of religious prophecies, as if disasters were truly about to come, and they spend their days reciting scriptures to ward off evil, affecting production. This is a great insult to Buddhism. To maintain the dignity of Buddhism and to save the deceived masses, we should, based on the government's religious policy and the teachings of Buddhism, thoroughly dispel the rumors and clearly distinguish between Buddhist law and non-Buddhist law. We should point out that such people are not only not true Buddhists but also malicious elements with ulterior motives. In this way, we can prevent bad people from using religion to carry out sabotage again and allow ethnic minority Buddhists to live and work in peace. This is a just struggle in accordance with the Constitution's "freedom of religious belief." If we do not clean them out, or even believe them and let them manipulate us, that would be a loss of "freedom of belief." Only by cleaning them out can we achieve true "freedom of belief." All Buddhists should always be vigilant against those who disguise themselves as Buddhists to sabotage Buddhism.

We must be fully alert: religion is seen by counterrevolutionaries as a "convenient place" for mischief. They spread their so-called "Communist Party destroying religion" reactionary rumors everywhere. I heard such rumors even when I went to Myanmar. My friends from Myanmar also raised these rumors to us, and we answered them with the facts of religious freedom. There are many examples of counterrevolutionaries using religion to carry out sabotage. I only mentioned a couple. In the future, we should continue to propagate and implement the unshakable policy of "freedom of religious belief" to educate the broad masses of religious believers. Religious believers themselves should thoroughly understand the policy of freedom of religious belief and sincerely love the motherland. Only in this way can we completely defeat the counterrevolutionaries on the religious front.

The counterrevolutionaries are so arrogant that we can no longer turn a blind eye. We should strictly criticize the idea of complacency and strengthen the concept of law. Those who are determined to be enemies of the people can only be suppressed. If we emphasize leniency one-sidedly, it will be like a flood breaking through a dam, causing widespread disasters and causing great losses to the national construction cause. Therefore, we should combine leniency with suppression, seriously handle counterrevolutionary incidents, and ensure that no good person is wronged and no bad person escapes. This is beneficial to the completion of the national construction plan and in line with the common wishes and interests of all ethnic groups. For this reason, I request the revocation of the qualifications of Pan Han and Hu Feng as representatives of the National People's Congress and support the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to arrest and interrogate them.

At this time, when the Five-Year Plan is in its third year, all ethnic groups in the country are working diligently and thriftily. As Chairman Mao said, "We are doing something that our ancestors have never done before, something extremely glorious and great." The successful completion of this undertaking is the realization of the "Land of Bliss" in the Buddhist scriptures on earth. Let us unite more firmly, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and strive to build a socialist society that is a real "Land of Bliss" on earth.

**Speech by Representative Guo Ti Huo**

I fully agree with and support the reports of the leaders.

The First Five-Year Plan specifically outlines the tasks for developing the national economy from 1953 to 1957, and is a program of decisive significance for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people in striving to achieve the overall tasks of the transitional period. Such a great construction plan and massive construction investment are unprecedented in our country's history. Vice Premier Li Fuqun said: "Only a government led by the working class, which works wholeheartedly for the people's interests, can do this." This is completely correct.

In the past, there was a part of the national bourgeoisie that wanted to use their own strength to "save the nation through industry." I and my family members are overseas Chinese, and my family members and other overseas Chinese friends invested in the motherland to establish the Yong'an Cotton Mill, with the same sentiment. However, decades of experience have told us that under the economic aggression of imperialism, and under the oppression of feudal rule and bureaucratic capital, the national bourgeoisie wanted to follow the capitalist path and use private strength to "save the nation through industry," which is completely impossible. The reason is obvious: the economic lifeline of our country was once controlled by imperialism, and imperialism, which controlled the economic lifeline of our country, would never allow our country to develop national industry. Moreover, the reactionary rule colluded with imperialism, and for national industry, there was only destruction, not protection. Under such circumstances, the "industrial salvation" of our national industrial and commercial circles was completely an illusion, a dead-end path.

Our factory was established in 1921 with 30,000 spindles and developed to more than 200,000 spindles and more than 10,000 workers before liberation. On the surface, it seems that national industry could develop during the reactionary rule, but looking back at the history of development, it was not the case. Some of our factories were bought from failed peers, so part of the development of our factory was from the failed factories of other peers. From the perspective of the national economy as a whole, it was not a completely genuine development.

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government, in just six years, prices have stabilized, speculation has been eliminated, and people's purchasing power has increased year by year; the development of enterprises is based on the continuous growth of the national economy; we national industrial and commercial circles can play an active role in management in a stable environment, making the growth of enterprises have a solid material foundation. This fact tells us that only by following the socialist path can China become prosperous and strong.

The First Five-Year Plan is a plan to lay the foundation for socialist construction. In this Five-Year Plan, the national bourgeoisie should strive in the direction of sincerely accepting socialist transformation, accepting leadership, following the state plan, practicing thrift, opposing waste, improving technology, improving quality, reducing costs, accumulating construction funds for the state, and creating conditions for enterprise reform. This is an important content of accepting socialist transformation and also an important task of this Five-Year Plan. Taking the situation of Shanghai's private cotton textile industry as an example, practicing thrift and opposing waste is completely necessary. This task is also completely achievable. A year ago, the cotton consumption per piece of yarn in Shanghai's private cotton textile mills was 395 to 400 jin, and now it has been reduced to 387.42 jin, but state-owned cotton mills have reduced it to 384.98 jin, and there is still room for further reduction. If Shanghai's private cotton textile industry can reduce the cotton consumption to the current standard of state-owned mills a year earlier, while ensuring quality, it can save more than 4 million jin of cotton in a year. This saved cotton can be used to weave more than 400,000 pieces of cloth. This is just one example. Of course, there are many other aspects that can be saved in Shanghai's private cotton textile industry. If all industries can achieve the production and savings targets of the Five-Year Plan, they can definitely make a considerable contribution.

Now, our Yong'an Cotton Mill and Shanghai Shenxin Cotton Mill are, in accordance with the correct policy of the Party and the government, using the saved funds to cooperate with the state economy to establish a new public-private joint venture textile mill in Hefei, Anhui. The basic construction investment plan of this mill has saved 28% from the initial plan to the latest approved plan. The main savings are in the living area, reducing the initial planned construction area by 38%, and the building construction cost by 49%. For example, the construction cost of dormitories has been reduced from 70 yuan per square meter to 30 yuan. The saved amount is enough to purchase all the textile machinery for the entire mill. This fact shows that the State Council's instructions on implementing the thrift policy in basic construction are extremely correct and feasible.

In addition, 70% of the production increase targets of the Five-Year Plan rely on the existing industrial production base, and private industry accounts for a considerable proportion of the existing industrial base. Therefore, we private industrial and commercial circles must work even harder, follow the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working masses, actively operate businesses that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, and fulfill our responsibilities in the Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Representative Wang Juqian**

I fully agree with the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuqun on the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development. I also fully agree with the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, as well as the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget.

I believe that the scale of construction and the speed of development of various sectors of the national economy in the First Five-Year Plan are very appropriate. The total expenditure for national economic construction and cultural education construction over five years will reach 766.4 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 70 million taels of gold; important products that our country has never produced before, such as automobiles, steam turbines, and chloramphenicol, will also be produced during the First Five-Year Plan. To use such a large amount of funds and such a fast speed for national construction is completely unimaginable in the past. Only a government led by the working class can do this. I am a railway engineering technician, and from my personal experience, I deeply feel this. In the six years since liberation, the engineering projects I have participated in have far exceeded those completed in the more than twenty years before liberation. Taking the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project I am currently working on as an example, the reactionary government had been shouting for forty years to build the Yangtze River Bridge, but no bridge was seen; only under the leadership of the government led by the working class could the construction begin. Now, as part of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Han River Railway Bridge was completed last year, and the Han River Highway Bridge will be open to traffic by the end of this year. According to the provisions of the Five-Year Plan draft, the main bridge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will be open to railway traffic in 1958, and to highway traffic in 1959. The wishes of the people for several decades can only be realized in a planned and rapid manner after the people have taken control of state power.

The sincere, selfless, and brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union is an important condition for our country to carry out planned economic construction rapidly. The Soviet Union's assistance to our construction is comprehensive and systematic. Taking the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project as an example, in 1950, when the exploration and design began, we received help from Soviet experts; in early 1953, when the preliminary design was completed, it was sent to Moscow for appraisal by a committee of famous experts from the Soviet Union. Last year, when the preparatory work for the main bridge began, the Soviet Union sent a large number of bridge experts to stay on-site and specifically help us. The technology that the Soviet Union helped us with is the most advanced. The foundation of the Yangtze River Bridge adopted the most advanced construction methods, using large-diameter drill rigs with large drill bits to drill into the rock layer at the bottom of the river. Such large-diameter drill rigs are also the latest models in the Soviet Union, indicating that the equipment and machinery that the Soviet Union helps us with are first-class and the most advanced. Due to the adoption of new construction methods, many on-site experimental tasks need to be done. Soviet experts have sincerely and selflessly, without reservation, contributed their experience, knowledge, and skills. In addition, Soviet experts have very patiently explained everything to us and have regularly given lectures to help us train technical personnel. For such a technically complex project as the Yangtze River Bridge, it is difficult to imagine that it could be built in a short period without the help of the Soviet Union.

The center of our First Five-Year Plan is to vigorously develop heavy industry, and the funds needed for industrialization must rely on our internal accumulation. The Five-Year Plan draft emphasizes practicing thrift and opposing waste and points out: "To implement a strict thrift system nationwide is a constant task for our people in the process of building a socialist and communist society." I think this is very necessary. In Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report, it is said: "The more important the construction unit, the greater the possibility of waste. Because these projects are often supported by the whole country and are not spared any cost. People's attention is on hoping that it will be completed, often neglecting and forgiving its waste." The construction of the Yangtze River Bridge is also such a case. Due to the complexity of the project, attention was often paid to whether it could be completed or not, while neglecting waste. Poor construction organization, low utilization rate of machinery and equipment, inappropriate use of materials, and unbalanced labor force often led to both rushing and idling. Although the project is technically complex, experience is insufficient, quotas are not accurate, and plans are not thorough, the most important reason, as pointed out by Vice Premier Li Xiannian in his report, is "errors in thinking." Many of our staff are interested in learning technology but not in learning organization and management; they are interested in the occupation of machinery and materials and construction methods but not in the utilization rate of machinery, material consumption rate, and construction organization; they only seek the completion of the project but lack an economic perspective. For us technicians, we must learn to calculate costs well; we must strengthen ideological remolding, continuously improve our political and ideological level; strengthen learning from advanced Soviet experience, continuously improve our technical and professional level; and in the condition of ensuring quality and safety, strive to reduce costs and strive to complete the project ahead of schedule to support the liberation of Taiwan and the full implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

The task of our First Five-Year Plan is very arduous. Based on the achievements so far, I believe that it is completely possible to complete and even overfulfill the various indicators set by the Five-Year Plan. This time, I went to Henan Province to participate in a collective inspection, which allowed me to see the achievements in various aspects such as industrial construction, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, culture, health, private industrial and commercial reform, and handicraft industry reform outside the scope of railway business. During the inspection of the grain warehouse in Luoyang City, I saw the situation where farmers collectively handed in their grain, and they were so organized and orderly, happily insisting on handing in the best grain, which particularly moved and inspired me. However, during the inspection, I also felt the sharpening and complexity of class struggle. In just one prefecture of Luoyang, there are still more than 3,000 fugitive landlords and counterrevolutionaries who have not been apprehended, and the farmers' unanimous demand is to severely suppress counterrevolutionaries and arrest fugitive landlords and counterrevolutionaries to bring them to justice. In the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, hidden saboteurs have also been arrested. The recent exposure of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is also a profound lesson for us technicians. We must be on guard against those who disguise themselves as active elements or pose as red experts and infiltrate into basic construction units. We must always be vigilant politically, clean up all hidden counterrevolutionaries, and smash their sabotage of the Five-Year Plan in any form. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will unite and strive to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development.

**Speech by Representative Yu Deyuan**

I wholeheartedly support the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development and the draft of the Military Service Law proposed by the State Council, and I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuqun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

After reading the draft of our country's First Five-Year Plan, I was deeply moved. During the more than twenty years of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, he only sucked the blood of the people to enrich himself, making the people suffer, and there was no question of national construction. Only today, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our great Chairman Mao, is it possible to truly build our own country. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support this plan and will realize this plan with unparalleled enthusiasm and labor.

I am a geologist, and I would like to offer a few suggestions on geological work.

First, we must strive to establish a steel industry base, explore mineral resources to ensure the mineral quantity needed for the Five-Year Plan, and provide the mineral resources needed for the construction of the second and third Five-Year Plans. Coal, iron, and oil are the most basic things for industrial construction. Without coal and iron, it is impossible to smelt steel, and thus it is impossible to develop the machinery industry, defense industry, transportation industry, and other industries. Without oil, it is impossible to meet the needs of defense and transportation. For the needs of steel smelting and other industries, we must also have various metals and chemical raw materials, refractory materials, and other mineral resources. As for radioactive elements, they are also important energy resources for the future industry. Our country is vast and rich in resources and is not lacking in these resources. In the past few years, the mineral resources discovered nationwide are not few, including copper, iron, manganese, chromium, and coal. The problem lies in our weak geological work foundation. So far, almost one-third of the country has not been geologically surveyed, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Even the mines that have been exploited, due to the plunder of imperialism and reactionary rulers in the past, have never had a clear understanding of the geological situation, which also brings great difficulties to today's geological work. Geological work, under such a heavy task and weak force, requires everyone to deeply understand the basic spirit of the Five-Year Plan, on the one hand, to proceed with the development of heavy industry as the key, and on the other hand, to create conditions for the second and third Five-Year Plans.

For example, in the northern part of Northeast China and the Tian Shan area in the northwest, there are rich and good coalfields. We should strive to find iron ore in those areas to develop into a steel industry base. The development of the petroleum industry is of great importance to us today. We must have confidence to carry out exploration in the large basins of the northwest and oil fields throughout the country. For these tasks, geologists must make great efforts, and at the same time, must obtain the common attention and support of the people throughout the country.

Again, in the work plan, while vigorously carrying out exploration, we must also organize a part of the force to carry out general surveys to ensure that general surveys do not lag behind exploration, and exploration does not lag behind exploitation. In the work process, we must also concentrate the geological work force of the whole country to prepare to compile a 1:1,000,000 geological map of the country and a 1:4,000,000 large-scale geological map, because this is the basic basis for future general surveys and prospecting.

Second, we must vigorously cultivate geological talents to meet the needs of national construction. During the more than twenty years of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, there were only about five hundred geologists, excluding those who died or changed jobs, there were only more than one hundred people who actually did geological work before liberation. Since liberation, due to the rapid development of our country's construction, geologists have been greatly insufficient. Under the government's vigorous cultivation, two geological colleges were established nationwide in 1952, and six universities developed related geological departments or majors. In the past few years, more than three thousand people have graduated from geological majors in colleges and universities, which is still far from meeting the actual needs. Currently, many important factories and mines do not even have one geologist, and water conservancy engineering geologists and geophysical prospecting personnel are even more in short supply. As mentioned above, we have vast lands that have not been geologically surveyed, and we urgently need underground resources, so cultivating geological talents is indeed one of our urgent and important tasks. According to the Five-Year Plan, many talents are needed in the geological field, so we must make the greatest efforts to cultivate them based on the current foundation.

Regarding the cultivation policy: we must implement comprehensive education. In the past, we did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's instruction of "good health, good study, good work," and we did not combine learning from advanced Soviet teaching experience with China's actual situation, resulting in students' heavy learning burden, neglecting politics, and hindering physical health. The talents cultivated could not fully meet the needs of national construction. In the future, we must better understand Chairman Mao's "three goods" instruction, better learn from advanced Soviet experience and combine it with China's actual situation, not only to cultivate talents that meet the standards but also to strive for a 100% graduation rate, achieving a 100% cultivation task.

Regarding the cultivation objectives, our Geological Exploration College focuses on cultivating talents in mineral geology, water geology, engineering geology, geophysical prospecting, and exploration engineering. In the past, due to our lack of production experience, we have not been able to deeply divide the cultivation objectives of these majors, which has affected the formulation of teaching plans and syllabi and the compilation of teaching materials. In the future, we must further clarify the cultivation objectives of each major and then compile teaching materials according to the teaching plans and syllabi to ensure that each geological talent cultivated has its own strengths and uses.

Furthermore, cultivating young teachers and improving the professional level of cadres is also one of our major tasks.

Third, improve political and professional levels, increase work efficiency, practice thrift, and oppose waste. I feel that participating in the first five-year economic construction of our country is a great honor, but at the same time, the task each of us bears is arduous and heavy. To complete the task, we must strive in two aspects: on the one hand, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, study dialectical materialism well, criticize bourgeois idealism, deeply study advanced Soviet experience, and carry out scientific research to improve our political and professional levels and work quality and efficiency. This is of particular importance to a geologist because if he does not strive in this aspect, it is not only a matter of whether he can complete the task, but the loss he brings to the country will also be greater than that of ordinary people. For example, if a water storage power station is built with a poor geological foundation, once the foundation is damaged, it will not only cause great losses to the country in terms of wealth and the construction system but may also endanger the lives and property of the people downstream of the dam. Again, if the exploration and estimation of mineral reserves do not meet the correct requirements, for example, if a mine that can only be mined for ten years is planned for twenty years of mining, it will cause serious losses when linked to the construction of comprehensive factories and transportation lines. Therefore, geological work should strive to improve quality, especially to learn from advanced Soviet experience. On the other hand, we must practice thrift and oppose waste. After listening to the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuqun and Li Xiannian, we feel that we have not fully understood the spirit of hard work and construction in the past. For example, when building the Northeast Geological College, there was no thrift at that time, and there was a wasteful mentality of "building it is also good." This mentality is obviously incompatible with building socialism. In the future, we must learn from the past experience in basic construction to ensure that there are no wasteful phenomena. Regarding the losses caused by poor technology in work, we must also pay serious attention. In the past, geological exploration work, in some regions or factories and mines, did not follow the exploration procedures, and many unnecessary drillings were made. It is known that a deep drilling often costs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. Again, in the design, due to the unclear geological situation, there are often rework phenomena. A rework of a design not only causes waste but often delays the construction schedule and affects a series of construction. In the future, we must ensure that no one is wasted, no drilling is wasted, and no design is wasted. We must always use socialist thinking to examine our work.

Fourth, rely on the masses, overcome difficulties, and strive to complete the task. In the future, geological work, especially general surveys, will not be entirely in places with convenient transportation and dense population. It is very likely to be in places with dense forests, vast deserts, or deep ravines and remote mountains. These places may be covered with thick snow or ice and snow, and geological surveys will definitely encounter some difficulties. In the past few years, through learning and participating in various political activities and construction work, our political and ideological awareness has improved, of course, we will not bow down to these difficulties, but we cannot say that there are no ideological problems. For example, fearing that the task cannot be completed in these places, or considering that it is not beneficial to personal advancement, or not willing to do this kind of work, or considering the hard work, these are all individualism and liberalism, which we must eliminate. Geologists stand proudly at the forefront of industrial construction. We have always wanted to build for the motherland, and now is the time to do things for the people. I believe that with the confidence to build a socialist society, no difficulties can stop our advance; relying on the broad masses, any difficulties can be overcome. Moreover, American imperialism is still occupying our territory and plotting a new war, and Taiwan is still occupied by the Kuomintang bandits and has not been liberated. The enemy will not be willing to see our planned construction and will definitely try to sabotage it in various ways. We must be vigilant and clean up all hidden counterrevolutionaries and not give any counterrevolutionaries the opportunity to act.

The First Five-Year Plan of the state is related to our construction foundation, related to the interests of all the people of the nation and the happiness of future generations, related to the consolidation of national defense and the defense of world peace. We must, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work diligently and thriftily, strengthen unity, and strive a hundred times to fight for the full realization of this plan.

**Speech by Procurator-General Zhang Dingxian**

I fully agree with and support the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of our country and the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and I fully agree with and support the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China and the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, as well as the report by Vice Premier Deng Zihui on the "Comprehensive Plan for Controlling Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Resources."

Our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation cause, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved great success due to the efforts of state organs and the people of the whole country. Now we are about to pass the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development. The passage and implementation of the Five-Year Plan will further improve the people's political awareness, inspire the people's labor enthusiasm, and make the broad masses actively participate in the political life and economic construction of the state, and strive to build and defend our socialist cause. It can be said that our socialist construction cause will proceed in a more planned and rapid manner, and our people's democratic dictatorship state system will be further consolidated and developed.

Title: The Struggle Against Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries Must Be Strengthened to Ensure the Success of the First Five-Year Plan

Page: 1

We know that the victory of socialism is the defeat of the enemy. The greater the victory of our socialist cause, the more desperate and frenzied the enemy's struggles and sabotage will be. After the national liberation, through a large-scale campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, we have eliminated a large number of counter-revolutionaries, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensured the smooth progress of national economic construction. However, with the development of our socialist construction and socialist transformation, the conspiracies of American imperialism to manufacture wars of aggression and its armed obstruction of our liberation of Taiwan have intensified. The sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies and various criminal elements have become more rampant. The Kuomintang bandits and the spies and agents sent by imperialism, along with the remaining counter-revolutionaries hidden within the country, are carrying out various forms of more sinister and more covert sabotage and hidden activities aimed at our socialist construction and socialist transformation. One hidden counter-revolutionary can cause significant damage. For example, the counter-revolutionary Liang Zhongru, hidden in the Hunan Province's Matian Coal Mine, set fire to the entire workshop of the mine's second district, causing a gas explosion underground that killed and injured more than forty workers, halting the entire district's operations for a month and a half. Among industrial and commercial circles, the vast majority support the constitution and socialist transformation, but there is a small minority that resolutely opposes socialist transformation and openly or secretly carries out various sabotage activities. The Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate recently investigated a sabotage group that had been hiding in the Shanghai procurement and supply station of the state-owned China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company, engaging in embezzlement and theft. They controlled the procurement, pricing, and supply of the company, colluding with unscrupulous capitalists to set up "underground factories" and, in collusion, embezzled and stole a large amount of state electrical equipment, stole state economic intelligence, and used counterfeit goods to replace genuine ones, causing significant damage to state economic construction. It has been ascertained that they embezzled and stole state property worth more than 80,000 yuan, and the direct and indirect damage they caused to state construction is immeasurable.

In rural areas, the remaining counter-revolutionaries, a few incorrigible landlord class elements, and lawless rich peasants are carrying out rampant sabotage activities against agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the unified procurement and marketing of important agricultural products. They even infiltrate cooperative societies, seize key positions, and usurp leadership to carry out sabotage from within. In 1954 alone, there were more than 560 major cases of sabotage against agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province. In the agricultural production cooperatives led by the nationally renowned labor models Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, and Geng Changluo, counter-revolutionaries had infiltrated and carried out sabotage. Counter-revolutionaries also use various loopholes to spread reactionary rumors and incite unrest. This year's unrest in Shao County, Fujian Province, was caused by counter-revolutionaries inciting the masses to sabotage the unified procurement and marketing of grain and plotting a counter-revolutionary comeback. In this incident, counter-revolutionaries carried out organized secret activities, aiming to seize local political power and systematically proposing a series of reactionary slogans, such as "Whoever does not participate has surplus grain, and everyone should go to his house to eat," to coerce the masses into participating in the unrest. The activities of counter-revolutionaries to incite unrest generally occur in backward areas and villages where land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries are not thorough, and in places where we are negligent and complacent. This must be a matter of serious concern and vigilance for us.

In cities and rural areas, the activities of thieves, hooligans, swindlers, and other criminal elements have not been completely eliminated. In many places, organized gangs specializing in stealing from state-owned factories, enterprises, and cooperatives have been discovered. Many of these gangs have counter-revolutionaries as their core or are closely linked to counter-revolutionaries.

Particularly worthy of our vigilance are the counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks. They are the most dangerous enemies of the revolution. The enemy knows that the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government have unlimited prestige among the masses, and that the people's democratic power is already very strong and consolidated. They know that it is very difficult and very disadvantageous for them to openly oppose the Communist Party and the people's government. The enemy also knows that a fortress is easiest to attack from within. Therefore, counter-revolutionaries adopt the most treacherous and covert methods of struggle, using two-faced tactics to disguise themselves as revolutionaries, infiltrate state organs and the Communist Party, and use various opportunities to carry out sabotage from within. The exposed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the Pan Han-nian counter-revolutionary case are clear examples. Based on the evidence we have uncovered, we have arrested and tried the counter-revolutionary criminals Pan Han-nian and Hu Feng. The exposure of the Pan Han-nian and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary cases is a great victory. It proves that as long as we remain vigilant, we can expose all the disguises of counter-revolutionaries and smash all their activities.

Since national liberation, the people's public security organs, people's procuratorates, and people's courts, with the active support of the people nationwide, have waged unremitting and fierce struggles against counter-revolutionaries, eliminating a large number of exposed counter-revolutionaries, making the people's democratic dictatorship more consolidated, and the social order more stable. However, even the exposed counter-revolutionaries that have been eliminated still have a significant number remaining, and we must continue to suppress and eliminate them. As for the counter-revolutionaries who use two-faced tactics and are hidden, we have not yet been able to fully and thoroughly expose and deal with them. To ensure the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and protect the safety of socialist construction, we must take decisive and effective measures to strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements, expose and eliminate all disguised and hidden counter-revolutionaries, and severely suppress and punish all counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements who sabotage socialist construction and socialist transformation. This is an important task for consolidating the people's democratic power and ensuring the smooth completion of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and it is a matter that all the people must pay close attention to.

In the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, not only the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs must work closely together, but we must also rely on the active participation of the broad masses. Therefore, we must carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among the broad cadres and the masses to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, raise the political awareness and revolutionary vigilance of cadres and the masses, and thoroughly overcome the rightist tendency of indifference and the complacent idea of peace. Under the correct guidance of the leadership, as long as the broad masses are mobilized and alerted, any disguised enemy will be exposed, and any counter-revolutionary will not escape the people's net.

To severely and correctly strike against counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements, and to protect the democratic rights of the people, we must strictly enforce the state's laws. For all counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements who engage in sabotage activities, those who should be arrested must be firmly arrested and severely punished according to law. We must thoroughly rectify and overcome the current tendency in some places to arrest those who should not be arrested, to sentence those who should not be sentenced, and to give light sentences for serious crimes. At the same time, we must strictly prevent and rectify illegal actions such as detention and interrogation without legal procedures, as well as wrongful arrests and convictions. We must continuously strengthen the construction of people's democratic legal system and strengthen people's procuratorial work, so that it can work in concert with the people's public security organs and people's courts to effectively suppress all counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage activities and punish various illegal and criminal acts that harm the state and the people's interests.

After the promulgation of the Constitution and the People's Procuratorate Organizational Law, the procuratorial organs at all levels, in accordance with the principle of active construction and step-by-step development, have actively implemented the People's Procuratorate Organizational Law and have planned and organized the construction of the procuratorial organs and their work. At present, the number of procuratorial organs nationwide has increased from 1,199 at the time of the promulgation of the Constitution to 1,963; the number of procuratorial personnel has increased from 6,963 to 12,155. The procuratorial organs at all levels, in conjunction with the various tasks of the state during this period, have actively and focusedly carried out various business work. First, they have focused on reviewing and approving the arrest of criminals, and the investigation and prosecution of important criminal cases. In accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on Arrest and Detention of the People's Republic of China, they have seriously reviewed the cases of criminals requested for arrest by the public security organs. The vast majority of these cases have been thoroughly investigated by the public security organs and have sufficient evidence, and thus have been promptly approved for arrest. For some cases where the investigation is not sufficient and the evidence is insufficient, they have been returned to the public security organs for supplementary investigation. For those who have not committed a crime and should not be arrested, they have not been approved for arrest, but this is only a very small number of cases in the review. In the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases, the procuratorial organs at all levels have reviewed and prosecuted the major counter-revolutionary cases of spies and agents investigated and solved by the public security organs, and have directly investigated and prosecuted a number of criminal cases that sabotage state economic construction and various key tasks. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has successively, on October 9, 1954, and May 20, 1955, prosecuted before the Military Court of the Supreme People's Court the cases of the American spies and agents Tang Nai, Zhang Zaiwen, and eleven others who secretly entered our country to engage in spy activities and endanger our country's security, the cases of the American spies Arnold and eleven others who flew into our country to engage in spy activities and endanger our country's security, and the cases of the four U.S. Air Force personnel Parks and others who flew U.S. military aircraft into our airspace to provoke and endanger our country's security, making these imperialist spy agents and criminals who invaded our airspace receive the judgment and punishment of our country's laws. For the work of prisons and labor reform institutions, the procuratorial organs at all levels have also conducted inspections, working with relevant departments to severely handle the sabotage activities of prisoners and to inspect and rectify improper measures in the custody and education of prisoners. The above work has played an active role in striking against counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements, ensuring the correct implementation of the law, and protecting the safety of the state's socialist cause.

In our work, there are also many shortcomings and errors. At present, the organizational structure of the people's procuratorial organs is not yet complete, and thus they cannot fully assume all their responsibilities. Furthermore, among some procuratorial personnel, due to being complacent about the achievements of the past campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they have not fully recognized the seriousness of the enemy's sabotage activities, and have developed a very dangerous tendency of complacency. Although we have been alert to and criticized this tendency, it has not yet been thoroughly overcome. Some procuratorial personnel in certain regions have an insufficient understanding of the importance of revolutionary legal system, or mechanically apply legal provisions, falling into bureaucratic formalism and detaching from the current actual struggle. The occurrence of these shortcomings and errors, although related to a lack of work experience, is also inseparable from the insufficient political and business leadership of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. We are working hard to overcome these shortcomings and errors.

In the future, we must continue to strengthen the construction of the procuratorial organs and their work in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements, establish a procuratorial workforce that is organizationally, politically, and professionally sound and strong, and fully play the role that procuratorial work should play in consolidating the revolutionary legal system and ensuring state construction. In accordance with the principle of universal establishment and gradual improvement, we will continue to strive to establish the procuratorial organs at all levels that have not yet been established, and plan to establish the Railway, Waterway Transportation Procuratorates and prepare to establish the Military Procuratorate. At the same time, based on the current actual situation, we will plan and organize the various business work of the procuratorial organs.

The procuratorial organs at all levels must strive to strengthen their work in the struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, rely on the support of the broad masses and the cooperation of other state organs, and resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionaries and various criminal elements to safeguard the smooth progress of the Five-Year Plan. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire country will unite as one, strive together, and the First Five-Year Plan of our country will definitely be successfully completed, and the great cause of building socialism will definitely achieve complete victory.

**Ma Teng'ai's Speech**

I fully agree with and support the draft of the First Five-Year Plan and the reports of Vice Premier Li Fu-chun, Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien, Vice Premier Peng Te-huai, Vice Chairman Peng Chen, and Vice Premier Teng Tzu-hui.

Vice Premier Li Fu-chun pointed out in his report: "We concentrate our efforts on developing industry, but we cannot reduce the importance of developing agriculture. Without the corresponding development of agriculture, our industrialization will not be realized." The fundamental way to develop agriculture at present in our country is to actively and step-by-step carry out the agricultural cooperativization movement, especially to develop agricultural production cooperatives characterized by land shares and unified management. This is not only an effective way to increase production but also a necessary path for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

My work area is the Wu-chung Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province. This is an agricultural area where the Hui and Han nationalities live together. Since liberation, with the completion of land reform, the Hui and Han people have demanded to organize and develop agricultural production. Especially after the propaganda and education of the general tasks of the transitional period and the Constitution, the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been further enhanced, and the agricultural cooperativization movement has made remarkable progress. At present, the autonomous prefecture has 277 agricultural production cooperatives, of which 89 are composed of Hui people, 124 are composed of Han people, and 64 are composed of Hui and Han people together; there are also more than 3,200 mutual aid teams, of which more than 1,200 are permanent teams; the number of agricultural households participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams accounts for 58% of the total number of households. Organizing and cooperating, walking the socialist road, has become the common wish of the Hui and Han people. It is precisely because of the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the various effective measures taken by the masses to increase production that the grain production of the autonomous prefecture has increased year by year, with the production in 1954 exceeding the original plan by 35%, and the 1955 plan increasing by 7% compared to 1954.

In an agricultural area where nationalities live together, as with any other work, we must start from national unity and fully pay attention to national characteristics. That is, we must develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations on the basis of unity between nationalities and within nationalities, and in all aspects, such as organizational forms and production activities, we must consider national characteristics. We cannot be the same as general areas or indiscriminately apply the experience of general areas. Practice has proven that as long as we do this, not only will production be developed, but national unity will also be strengthened. From the establishment of cooperatives in Wu-chung Hui Autonomous Prefecture, we have the following few experiences:

First, when propagating the establishment of cooperatives to the masses, we must combine it with the education of national policies. Especially, we must repeatedly emphasize how to specifically implement national policies in agricultural production cooperatives to dispel the concerns of the masses. At the same time, we must carry out national united front work and obtain the support of national and religious upper-class figures, which is also very necessary.

Second, we must correctly implement the rural class policy and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and in the spirit of national equality and unity, adopt the method of national consultation to prudently and properly handle all issues within the cooperative, preventing dictation or coercion. Because this not only relates to the issue of relying on poor peasants and firmly uniting middle peasants but also relates to the issue of unity between nationalities and within nationalities.

Third, in agricultural production cooperatives composed of Hui and Han people, we must pay special attention to mutual respect for customs and religious beliefs. For example, if Hui and Han members do not want to share a well, they can dig separate wells and use them separately. If they are not used to men and women working together, they can form separate teams and work separately. In the cooperative, pigs can be raised by Han members alone and not as a cooperative sideline. Such problems, as long as they are solved well, the cooperative will be more consolidated, and the cooperative will be more united. At the same time, in the configuration of cooperative cadres, we must also consider the appropriate candidates from the Hui and Han nationalities.

In addition, most of Wu-chung Hui Autonomous Prefecture is a large-scale water conservancy irrigation area, and part of it is a dry area. Therefore, in leading agricultural production, we must rely on the organized strength of the masses to take effective measures to increase production according to local conditions. In the former type of area, the main task is to do a good job in water conservancy, expanding the irrigation area; in the latter type of area, the main task is to do a good job in water and soil conservation, gradually changing the natural landscape, and according to possible conditions, plan to develop animal husbandry and sideline industries.

Comrades, the construction of socialism is a great common cause of all nationalities in our country. We must unite as one under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, increase production, practice economy, and strive for victories on all fronts to strive for the complete completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.

**Speech by Minister Zhu Xuefan**

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fu-chun's report on the development of the national economy's First Five-Year Plan and enthusiastically support the implementation of China's First Five-Year Plan; I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1954 national budget and the 1955 national budget, and I am willing to work with the people of the entire country and all postal and telecommunications workers to strive together to realize China's First Five-Year Plan and the 1955 national budget.

Our country, starting from 1953, entered the construction period of the First Five-Year Plan, and the people of the entire country are striving together for the great construction of the country. The completion of the First Five-Year Plan in our country will begin to change the historical face of China's economic backwardness and move forward towards the goal of a socialist society. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the main aspects of our postal and telecommunications construction are to strengthen the communication links between the capital and various important cities and new industrial cities, and to actively organize and steadily develop the postal and telecommunications business in rural areas in accordance with the needs of the construction of new industrial cities. During the national construction period, postal and telecommunications enterprises should improve their business and technical levels, pay attention to the research of postal and telecommunications science, improve management, increase the utilization rate of equipment and work quality, and adapt to the needs of the country and the people for postal and telecommunications, which is the current main direction of effort for all postal and telecommunications workers.

Postal and telecommunications enterprises are a component of the national economy, a department of national communications, and an important tool for the mutual connection of the people. "Postal and telecommunications communications can shorten time to overcome space, shorten production and circulation time, and thus promote the accelerated expansion of socialist reproduction." Modern production and all social activities need to use postal, telegraph, telephone, and other communication tools. Through postal and telecommunications, national orders are transmitted, local situations are communicated, domestic and international relations are connected, and national defense needs are coordinated. Each department of the national economy, each enterprise, government agency, school, organization, and the people need the service of postal and telecommunications at all times.

The entire production process of postal and telecommunications work is also the consumption process of the users of postal and telecommunications. It does not produce any commodity, but its labor results are to produce a beneficial effect for social production. Postal and telecommunications work cannot be measured like the quality of general commodities, but can only be measured by the effect obtained by the users to reflect its good or bad performance. Therefore, the measure of postal and telecommunications work is: speed, accuracy, safety, and convenience. In the process of transmitting mail and telegrams, there must be no errors, delays, losses, damage, or theft, and it is especially important to ensure the confidentiality of national communications.

With the development of the entire national construction cause, the development of postal and telecommunications enterprises is also very significant. With Beijing as the center, the basic communication network connecting all parts of the country has been formed. At present, the number of long-distance telecommunications lines in the country above the county level is nearly double that of 1949. The capitals of all provinces and major industrial cities, and Beijing can all directly reach telegrams and long-distance telephone calls. From the provincial capital to the county, most of them can reach telegrams and long-distance telephone calls, and many places between counties and districts can also reach telegrams and long-distance telephone calls. In 1950, with the help and cooperation of the Soviet Union, a direct wire telegraph and long-distance telephone line from Beijing to Moscow was established. The total length of this line is nearly 10,000 kilometers, and it symbolizes the unbreakable unity and friendship between the two great allied countries of China and the Soviet Union. In the postal sector, the total length of postal routes in the country has reached more than 1.64 million kilometers, an increase of more than double that of 1949. In the past, mail to Tibet had to go through foreign countries, but since the completion of the Kangding-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet highways, our mail cars have quickly extended directly from the interior to the distant Tibet. Now, if the schedule is connected, a letter from Beijing to Lhasa can be delivered in just 16 days. From the north to Manchuria, from the south to Hainan Island, from the east along the coast, to the west to the border, mail can be directly and quickly delivered. In international affairs, postal and telecommunications communications are also developing day by day. We have close postal and telegraph communications with the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and various brotherly countries in Europe. We have already established direct communications with 41 countries in the world.

Based on the characteristics of postal and telecommunications work and its role in national political, economic, and cultural construction and the daily material and cultural life of the people, the basic requirement for postal and telecommunications work is to ensure good quality. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has taken a number of measures to eliminate errors, speed up the operation and delivery of mail, prevent losses and damage, and prevent embezzlement, theft, and the leakage of state secrets, and has made some improvements. However, upon inspection, it is still far from our requirements, and to this day, various accidents that affect quality still occur from time to time. What is particularly intolerable is that there are still counter-revolutionaries who occasionally carry out sabotage, and the situation of embezzlement, theft, and the leakage of state secrets has not been completely eliminated, and some of the incidents are very serious. This is a major problem in the postal and telecommunications department, and it must be overcome in the future.

I would like to briefly discuss the issues of newspaper and magazine distribution and rural postal services, postal agency offices, and county-level telephone (local telecommunications) problems.

First, let's talk about the distribution of newspapers and magazines and rural postal services. The distribution of newspapers and magazines is an important political task for the postal and telecommunications department. Since 1950, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has fully undertaken this task. Over the years, under the guidance and support of local party and government agencies, the distribution of newspapers and magazines has developed rapidly. At present, the number of newspapers issued per issue (i.e., the number of copies issued per issue) by postal and telecommunications bureaus nationwide has reached 11.12 million, an increase of 408% compared to 1950, and the number of magazines issued per issue has reached 14.86 million, an increase of 239% compared to 1952. In the future, it will definitely develop further. However, at present, there are still 25% of the townships in the country where our rural postal workers cannot reach, and as for the villages below the townships, most of them have to rely on passersby to deliver the mail. In this way, it is very difficult to deliver newspapers and magazines universally and timely. In rural areas, there is currently a phenomenon of newspapers and magazines not being able to be subscribed to and delivered, and the same situation exists for the collection and delivery of rural mail. This is an important problem that needs to be actively and gradually solved. We currently cannot universally set up postal and telecommunications institutions and greatly increase the number of rural delivery personnel, otherwise it will inevitably increase the financial expenditure of the state. At the same time, the postal delivery system of the Soviet Union's collective farms is also the direction we should take. Therefore, on the one hand, the postal and telecommunications department should actively tap potential, rationally adjust rural postal routes, and gradually increase service institutions and rural postal personnel. On the other hand, we still need to organize social forces. Currently, the postal and telecommunications department is organizing voluntary rural postal stations through local party and government agencies to expand the network of newspaper and magazine promotion and postal and telecommunications services. At present, Shanxi, Hebei, and the provinces in Northeast China have universally established voluntary rural postal stations. Practice has proven that the personnel of voluntary rural postal stations do not spend much time, but the villagers can get a lot of convenience in subscribing to newspapers and magazines and collecting and delivering mail. This work still needs the support and assistance of various agencies and relevant departments, so that both sides can be combined to gradually solve the contradictions between the needs and possibilities of rural postal services. In addition, in places where conditions are ripe, we can also try the system of cooperative postal delivery.

Next, let's talk about the problem of postal agency offices. In rural postal business, a part of it relies on agency offices to operate. In the past, most of the agency offices were operated by private merchants and individuals. Due to the complex composition of these agency personnel, there were often incidents of stealing letters, remittances, and leaking secrets, which damaged the interests of the state and the people. In the past, we did not fully understand and were not fully aware of this situation. In 1953, Chairman Mao correctly pointed out that the rectification work of postal and telecommunications enterprises must be carried out from top to bottom to the agency offices, which gave us great enlightenment. We have carried out a planned and comprehensive rectification of private merchant agency offices. In 1954, 3,526 embezzlement cases were found, and the total amount of old and new embezzlement was 470,000 yuan. Some of the cases were very serious. For example, in Tanghe County, Henan Province, an agency office was found to have embezzled more than 1,000 yuan, of which 840 yuan was the remittance of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and the funeral allowance for martyrs. These lawless agency personnel, in order to achieve the purpose of embezzlement, destroyed letters, cut off the connection between soldiers and their families, and even lied, saying that a certain soldier had died, causing a soldier's family to cry her eyes out. There are many other serious cases. Through the rectification of agency offices, those lawless agency personnel have been dealt with by the government according to the severity of their crimes. Most of the rectified agency offices have been taken over by supply and marketing cooperatives and other state-owned enterprises. According to our understanding, those who have been taken over by cooperatives have been universally praised by the masses as being more reliable and convenient than private agency offices. For example, when receiving remittances, you can directly buy the things you need, and you will no longer have the accumulation and delay or theft that occurred during private agency operations. To ensure the quality of postal and telecommunications work, it is necessary to rectify the agency offices, and only by placing the agency offices on a reliable socialist or semi-socialist basis can the quality of postal and telecommunications work be improved and not be damaged at the agency office link.

Finally, let's talk about the county-level telephone, that is, the local telecommunications problem. Local telecommunications is an important communication tool for county-level party and government agencies to guide rural work, and it has a very close relationship with the socialist transformation of agriculture. Over the years, local telecommunications have developed significantly, which is completely necessary. According to the relevant decisions of the Second National Provincial and Municipal Planning Conference, during the First Five-Year Plan period, for local telecommunications below the county level, the main task should be to strengthen the maintenance of existing equipment, carry out rectification with focus, and gradually improve the quality of calls; only in cases where it is absolutely necessary and local financial resources permit, can new construction be carried out, and its construction funds should be allocated in the local financial budget. Currently, the postal and telecommunications department still has the problems of poor maintenance, poor management, and low call quality in the management of local telecommunications. At the same time, due to the lack of a unified charging system, there is a tendency of supply and demand in some places, and some local cadres often talk for one or two hours at a time without finishing, causing a lot of waste. To overcome the above shortcomings, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is drafting the construction standards, management regulations, and charging standards for local telecommunications to gradually improve the quality of local telephones and strengthen the management of local telecommunications. The supply and demand management situation should be changed, and in the future, local telecommunications should charge a certain fee to reduce the maintenance costs of local places and gradually achieve reasonable management. According to the recent instructions of the State Council, the operation of county-level telephones will still be managed by the provincial people's committees, entrusted to the postal and telecommunications department. Therefore, we, the postal and telecommunications department, must be responsible for doing a good job in local telecommunications work.

The basic task of postal and telecommunications enterprises in the transitional period of the state is to serve the increasing industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, and the material and cultural life of the people; and to serve national defense. To this end, we must, according to the advanced technical standards of Soviet socialist postal and telecommunications, plan and step-by-step, but thoroughly, transform the technology of our country's postal and telecommunications enterprises, so that in a relatively short period of time, we can reach the advanced technical standards of Soviet postal and telecommunications. For the factors in postal and telecommunications enterprises that are only beneficial to capitalism and not beneficial to socialism, we must resolutely and step-by-step carry out reforms, and establish the principles and systems of socialist enterprise management; continuously improve work efficiency, strengthen confidentiality, improve service attitudes, and ensure that the orders, resolutions, instructions, documents, newspapers, and letters of the Party and the government are timely and accurately issued and transmitted.

To achieve the above tasks, the current main work of the postal and telecommunications department is to rectify the organizational structure, establish and improve the business management system, practice economy, and continuously improve enterprise management. It is estimated that after the reorganization of the entire national postal and telecommunications system, more than 8,000 management personnel can be streamlined, which will be used to strengthen the production work of the business units and increase and expand the postal and telecommunications service institutions; at the same time, establish and improve various business systems, improve work methods and work styles, and continuously improve work efficiency. To accumulate national construction funds, the postal and telecommunications department has initially drafted a plan to save 3.2 million yuan in three years. We will do our best to ensure the completion and strive to over-fulfill this savings plan. We will also strengthen the struggle against the enemy, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, further purify the organization of the postal and telecommunications department, and persistently fight against embezzlement, theft, and lawlessness, strengthen confidentiality, and improve work quality.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, with the support and supervision of the broad masses and the assistance of various departments, through the joint efforts of all postal and telecommunications workers, we will be full of confidence to realize the development plan of the postal and telecommunications department stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, so as to better serve the needs of national construction and the people.

**Speech by An Wenqin**

Since liberation, the Central People's Government has been established, and all matters that need to be promoted or abolished have been carried out in an orderly manner, actively organized, and reported in the newspapers, which need not be repeated. However, I have a small suggestion to make, which I hope will be considered. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, China has washed away all the failures and humiliations in its past diplomacy, as well as the conditions for national subjugation, to strive for equality among nations and to become one of the powerful and prosperous countries in the world, shining brightly and vigorously, with the momentum of a rising sun. Although I hope that the government officials will not be arrogant or complacent, for arrogance leads to laziness, and complacency leads to overflowing, which is not good for the country. We must remain vigilant and humble. I also hope that the officials will not forget the difficulties of the 25,000-li Long March and the hardships at Ma'ergai, especially the 600 million people now living and working in peace and plenty. I also hope that the people will not forget the oppression and enslavement under the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandits. Upon reading the "Report on the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan," I feel refreshed and enlightened, with every word being a pearl and every sentence being a gem, all flowing from the heart, truly a medicine for the country and a boat of mercy for the world. Anyone with blood in their veins will wholeheartedly and resolutely support it to the end. Regarding the twenty-year history of Hu Feng's conspiracy to sabotage the country, it is like a tiger wearing a Buddha's crown, covering up its evil and highlighting its good, deceiving the state and drugging the people, like poisoned candy, making people unaware of its harm. Now it has been thoroughly exposed. As for the running dogs, they have been caught in the net, leaving no trace of fire to start a prairie fire. From now on, the people will be united, the military and the people will be united, production will be increased, and economy will be practiced, supporting the front line. On the bed, we will not allow others to sleep, and we will definitely liberate Taiwan, annihilate the Kuomintang traitorous clique, expel the American imperialists from the country, and save the eight million compatriots in Taiwan from the fire, placing them on the bed, returning to the embrace of the motherland, and enjoying this equality, freedom, glory, and happiness without end. Looking forward to it, I bless it with fragrant incense, and I hope that everyone will strive for it.

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    喜饶嘉错代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、邓子恢副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并在今后工作中努力贯彻执行。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是在中国共产党和毛主席的直接领导下，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务而制定的规模宏大的计划，国家用在这上面的总支出，折合黄金约为七万万两以上，“用这样大量的资金来进行国家建设，这在中国过去历史上，完全是不可想像的，只有在工人阶级领导下的、全心全意的为人民利益而工作的政府，才可能来这样做。”这个计划的完成，将大大地改变我国经济落后的面貌，而为全国人民及后世子孙创造巨大的幸福，像这样的继续建设几十年，我国就可以赶上或者超过资本主义国家的工业水平，这样快的速度，也只有在工人阶级领导下，才能做得到，这是工人阶级的伟大。
    这个计划，是充分照顾了少数民族利益的，它按照宪法规定来实现民族区域自治，发展各民族经济、文化、教育、卫生和医疗工作，如从财力上和技术上尽可能来扶助民族地区畜牧业的发展；修筑少数民族地区的铁路和公路；发展民族方面的学校、书刊、广播、电影及文艺活动；增加适合于少数民族需要的工业品和农业生产资料的供应。此外并规定适当分布工业地区，改变工业集中沿海城市的状态，以逐渐提高落后地区的经济水平，这对少数民族地区资源的开发将起着重大的作用。青海柴达木盆地蕴藏着极其丰富的地下资源，是祖国各族人民的宝库，它的开发，是有利于整个国家建设事业的，青海人民一定尽全力来支援国家对此一地区的大力开发工作。
    我们社会主义制度国家的建设资金的来源，只能依靠国内的积累。为此，必须反对浪费厉行节约来积累资金，这在苏联社会主义建设中已行之有效，现在国务院提出五年计划的后三年内节约二十亿元的计划和号召是极其贤明而正确的。我们必须认真执行毛主席的节约指示，有效地建立节约制度，真正地学会节约方法，展开经常的全民性的节约运动，与一切浪费现象作无情的斗争。同时要在生活问题上，提倡俭约，力戒奢华，学习苏联人民以往刻苦建设的精神，发扬我国克勤克俭的优良传统，把从建设中得来的果实，主要用在扩大国家建设事业特别是重工业建设上去。
    由于我们建设计划的执行得很好，引起了国内外敌人各种形式的疯狂破坏，最近，在有些牧业区，发现了敌人捏造“在牧业区搞合作社是变相的牛羊归公”的谣言，影响了牧民的生产情绪，我的看法，合作社是根据当地的实际情况，把分散的牧户适当地组织起来，以便更好地改善放牧技术，更多的增产自己的牛羊，走上更加富裕的康乐生活。同样，这种改造问题，是由少数民族自己作主的，刘少奇委员长明白指出社会主义改造问题，让少数民族用较长的时间来从容考虑，照自己的意愿去决定。李富春副总理在报告中也明确指出：“各少数民族的社会主义改造，应该根据本民族历史发展的特点，尊重人民自己的意愿”的原则，这些已把民族地区的社会主义改造问题交代得非常清楚，牧区人民应明辨是非，粉碎一切破坏自己生产的无稽的谣言。
    更有许多反革命分子，利用宗教进行破坏，这在少数民族地区常有发现，如青海部分牧业区谣传天书下降，天书上说：世界即将毁灭，百姓要遭大灾大难等谣言惑众，这是用佛教伪装起来的狰狞张牙的恶魔，毫无一点真正的宗教气味，可是一般有信仰无智慧的人，由于相信宗教上的预言形式的愚昧的信仰所迷惑，好像灾难真的即将降临，日惟念经禳解，影响生产，这是对佛教的莫大侮辱。为了维护佛教尊严和拯救被骗群众，应当根据政府的宗教政策和佛教的教义，彻底破除谣言，把佛法和非佛法的分别交代清楚，指出这种人不仅不是真正的佛教徒，而且是别有用心的坏分子。这样，就可使坏人无法利用宗教再施其破坏伎俩，而使边境少数民族的佛教徒能够安居乐业。这对藏身在宗教里的敌人的清洗工作，是符合宪法“宗教信仰的自由”的正义斗争，假如不予清除，甚至相信他而任其摆布，那就是失掉了“信仰自由”；只有把他们清洗干净了，才能实现真正的“信仰自由”。凡是佛教徒应当随时注意防范那些伪装佛教来破坏佛教的恶魔。
      必须充分警惕：宗教这一角落，在反革命分子看来，总认为是“方便多门”，容易捣鬼。他们处处散布其所谓“共产党破坏宗教”的反动谣传。我这次到缅甸也听到了这样的谣言，缅甸朋友并提出这些谣言来问我们，我们用宗教信仰自由的事实回答了他们。反动分子利用宗教进行破坏的事例非常多，我仅举了一两个例子。今后应当继续经常宣传和贯彻坚定不移“宗教信仰自由政策”，来教育广大的宗教信徒；宗教徒本身更应彻底认识宗教信仰自由政策，真诚地热爱祖国，这样才能在宗教战线上彻底打垮反革命分子。
    反革命分子如此嚣张，再不容许我们熟视无睹，应该严格批判太平思想，加强法律观念。对那些坚决与人民为敌者，只能予以镇压；如果片面的强调宽大，则如洪水溃堤而出，泛滥成灾，使国家建设事业招致巨大的损失。因此应把宽大与镇压紧密结合起来，认真处理反革命事件，做到不冤枉一个好人，更不让一个坏人漏网。这样做，是有利于完成国家建设计划和符合各族人民共同愿望和利益的。基于这个理由，我要求撤销潘汉年和胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并拥护全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准将他们逮捕审讯的措施。
    当此五年计划进行到第三年之际，全国各族人民都在兢兢业业，克勤克俭地努力工作，正像毛主席所说的：“我们正在做，我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”这个事业的圆满完成，即是佛经上所说的“极乐世界”在人间获得实现。让我们更巩固的团结起来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导之下，努力建设现实的人间极乐世界的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    郭棣活代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护各位首长的报告。
    第一个五年计划，具体地规定了从一九五三年到一九五七年发展国民经济的任务，是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。这样伟大的建设计划和巨大的建设投资，是我国有史以来所从未有过的创举。李富春副总理说：“只有在工人阶级领导下的、全心全意为人民的利益而工作的政府，才可能来这样做。”这是完全正确的。
    我们民族资产阶级中过去曾经有一部分人，想用自己的力量来“实业救国”。我和我们家属是华侨，我们家属和其他华侨亲友投资祖国，创办永安纱厂，也是抱着同样的心情。但是几十年来的经验告诉我们，在帝国主义的经济侵略下，在封建统治和官僚资本的摧残下，民族资产阶级想沿着资本主义道路，用私人力量来“实业救国”，是完全不可能的。理由很明显，我们国家的经济命脉过去操纵在帝国主义手里，操纵了我国经济命脉的帝国主义，决不会允许我国发展民族工业。再加上反动统治与帝国主义勾结，对民族工业，只有摧残，没有保护。在这种形势之下，我们民族工商业者的“实业救国”，完全是一个幻想，是一条走不通的死路。
    我们的厂，是由一九二一年三万锭子创设起来的，到解放前发展到二十多万锭子和一万多工人的规模。看上去，似乎在反动统治时期，也可以发展民族工业，但回想一下过去发展的历史，完全不是这么回事。我们有些厂，是向经营失败的同业买进的，因此我们厂的发展，其中一部分就是别的同业失败的厂，从整个国民经济来说，并不是完全真正的发展。
    解放以后，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，短短六年的时间内，物价稳定，投机消灭，人民购买力逐年提高；企业的发展，完全建筑在国民经济不断增长的基础上；我们民族工商业才能在稳定的环境中发挥经营的积极作用，使企业的增长，有坚实的物质基础。这一事实告诉我们，只有走社会主义道路，才能使中国繁荣富强。
    第一个五年计划，是为实现社会主义建设奠定基础的计划。在这一个五年计划中，我们民族资产阶级应该努力的方向，是忠诚地接受社会主义改造，而接受领导、服从国家计划、厉行节约、反对浪费、改进技术、提高品质、降低成本、为国家积累建设资金、为企业改造创造条件，是接受社会主义改造的重要内容，也是这个五年计划的重要任务之一。以我们上海私营棉纺织业的情况来看，厉行节约、反对浪费，是完全有必要的。这个任务也是完全可以实现的。上海私营棉纺织厂一年前每一件纱的用棉量是三百九十五斤到四百斤，现在降低到三百八十七点四二斤，但国营纱厂已降低到三百八十四点九八斤，并且还有降低的可能。如果上海私营棉纺织业能够在保证质量的前提下，早一年把用棉量降低到现在国营厂的标准，一年内就可以节约四百多万斤棉花。这样节约下来的原棉，可以多织四十多万匹布。这仅仅是一个例子。当然，在上海私营棉纺织业中，还有很多方面可以节约的。其他各行各业如果都能按照五年计划的指标，增产节约，一定可以作出相当的贡献。
    现在我们永安纱厂和上海申新纱厂的劳资双方，就是秉着党和政府的这一正确方针，要将节约下来的资金与国营经济合作，在安徽合肥创办一个新的公私合营的纺织厂。这个厂的基本建设投资计划，从最初的计划，到最近核定的计划，共节省了百分之二十八。其中主要的是生活区，把最初计划建筑面积缩减了百分之三十八，房屋建筑费节省了百分之四十九，如宿舍建筑费从每平方公尺七十元减为三十元。计算节约下来的数字，足够购置全厂的纺织机器。这个事实说明，国务院关于在基本建设中贯彻节约方针的指示，是非常正确、而且切实可行的。
    还有，五年计划的增产指标中，百分之七十是依靠原有的工业生产基础，而原有的工业基础中私营工业又占相当的比重。因此我们私营工商业者，必须格外努力，服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，接受工人群众的监督，积极经营有利于国计民生的事业，来尽我们在五年计划中应尽的责任。
    汪菊潜代表的发言
    我完全同意中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第
  一个五年计划草案，和李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。我也完全同意一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算，以及李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告。
    我国第一个五年计划的建设规模和国民经济各部门的发展速度，我认为是很适当的。全国经济建设和文化教育建设的支出总数五年内达到七百六十六亿四千万元，折合黄金有七万万两之多；我国从来没有生产过的重要产品如汽车、蒸汽透平、氯霉素等，也都能在第一个五年计划期内生产。用这样大量的资金和这样快的速度来进行国家建设，在过去是完全不可想像的，只有在工人阶级领导下的政府，才有可能这样做。我是一个铁路的工程技术人员，从我自己亲身的经历，也深深体会到这一点。我在解放后短短的六年之中，所参加做的工程，就大大地超过了解放前二十多年所做的。拿我现在正参加工作的武汉长江大桥工程来说，过去反动政府曾经叫喊了四十年要修长江大桥，但没有见到桥的影子；只有在工人阶级领导下的政府，才能开始修建。现在作为武汉长江大桥组成部分的汉水铁路桥已在去年建成，汉水公路桥也将在今年年底通车。根据五年计划草案的规定，武汉长江大桥正桥的铁路部分一九五八年通车，公路部分一九五九年通车。几十年来人民的愿望，只有在人民自己掌握了国家政权以后，才有可能来有计划地迅速地实现。
    苏联的真诚的、无私的、兄弟般的援助，是我国能够迅速地进行有计划的经济建设的重要条件。苏联对我国建设的援助是全面的和系统的。以武汉长江大桥的工程为例，一九五○年开始钻探设计的时候，就得到了苏联专家的帮助，一九五三年初步设计完成，就送到莫斯科由苏联全国著名的专家组成了委员会来帮助鉴定。去年正桥的准备工作开始，苏联又派来了大批的桥梁专家，常驻现场具体帮助我们。苏联所帮助我们的是最新的技术。长江大桥的基础就是采用了最新的施工法，在大管柱内用大直径钻头的钻机钻入江底岩层。像这样大直径钻头的钻机，在苏联也还是最新式的，说明了苏联帮助我们的机具设备都是第一流的，最先进的。由于采用了新的施工方法，有很多实地试验的工作需要做，苏联专家们忠诚无私地、毫无保留地将他们的经验知识和技能贡献出来。此外，苏联专家并很耐心地向我们解释一切，还定期讲课来帮助我们培养技术人材。像长江大桥这样技术复杂的工程，如果没有苏联对我们的帮助，很难想像能够在短时期内修建起来。
    我国第一个五年计划的中心是大力发展重工业，而工业化所必需的资金是要依靠我们内部积累。五年计划草案着重地提出了厉行节约、反对浪费，并指出：“在全国范围内全面地实行严格的节约制度，这将是我国人民在建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会的过程中的经常任务。”我认为是很必要的。在李富春副总理的报告中说：“愈是重要的建设单位，浪费的可能性愈大。因为进行这些工程，常常是全国支援和不惜工本的。人们注意的是希望它建成，常常忽视和原谅它的浪费。”长江大桥的工程也就是这种情况，由于工程技术复杂，经常注意了建成建不成的问题，而忽视了浪费。施工组织得不好，机具设备的使用率很低，材料的使用不适当，劳动力不平衡，常常发生既赶工又窝工的现象。虽然是技术复杂，经验不够，定额不准，计划不周，但是最重要的原因，正如李先念副总理在报告中所指出的，是“思想上的错误”。我们很多工作人员，对于学习技术有兴趣，对于学习组织管理不感兴趣；对于机具材料的占用和施工方法有兴趣，对于机具使用率、材料消耗率和施工组织不感兴趣；只求工程任务的完成而缺乏经济观点。对于我们技术人员来说，我们一定要学会善于计算成本；必须加强思想改造，不断地提高政治思想水平；加强学习苏联先进经验，不断地提高技术业务水平；在保证质量和安全的条件下，努力降低造价，争取提前通车，来支援解放台湾和五年计划的全部实现。
    我国第一个五年计划的任务是很艰巨的，根据已有的成就来看，我认为完成和争取超额完成五年计划所规定的各种指标，是完全有可能的。这次我去河南省参加集体视察，使我看到了铁路业务范围以外的，工业建设、农林水利、文教卫生、私营工商业和手工业改造等各方面的成就。在洛阳市视察粮食仓库时，看到了农民们集体缴公粮的情况，他们是这样的有组织有次序，很高兴地一定要把最好的粮食来送缴公粮，这特别使我感动而鼓舞了我。但是在视察中也体会到阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化。单就洛阳一个专区范围，还有三千多逃亡地主和反革命分子没有归案，农民们的一致要求是严厉镇压反革命，逮捕逃亡地主及反革命分子归案法办。在武汉长江大桥的工程中，也曾逮捕到暗藏的破坏分子。最近胡风反革命集团的揭露，对于我们技术人员也是很深刻的教训。我们要提防那种伪装积极或者冒充红色专家而混进基本建设单位中的反革命分子。我们必须时时刻刻地提高政治警惕性，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，击破他们对于五年计划的任何形式的破坏。我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结起来，努力奋斗，一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    喻德渊代表的发言
    我衷心拥护国务院所提出的发展国民经济的第
  一个五年计划草案和兵役法草案，并完全同意李富春、李先念、彭德怀、邓子恢四位副总理及彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。
    我看了我国第一个五年计划草案以后，非常感动。蒋介石反动统治的二十多年当中，只是吸取民脂民膏来养肥自己，弄得民不聊生，更谈不到国家建设；只有今天在中国共产党和我们伟大的毛主席的英明正确领导下，才有可能真正来建设自己的祖国，所以我衷心地拥护这个计划，并将以无比的热情与劳动来实现这个计划。
    我是一个地质工作者，我现在就地质工作方面提出几点意见。
    第一、要努力建立钢铁工业基地，要探寻矿源，以保证五年计划所需矿量，并为第二个和第三个五年计划提供工业建设所需的矿产资料。煤、铁、石油是工业建设最基本的东西，没有煤、铁，便无法炼钢，因而也就无法发展机械工业、国防工业、交通运输业以及其它工业；没有石油，就不能满足国防及交通等方面的需要。为着炼钢和其它工业方面的需要，我们还必须要有各种各样金属以及化工原料、耐火材料等矿产资源。至于放射元素，更是将来工业方面的重要动力资源。我国地大物博，并不是缺乏这些资源，就这几年来全国所探明的矿产来说，发现有铜、铁、锰、铬及煤等矿产并不少。问题在于我们地质工作基础薄弱，到目前为止，差不多全国还有三分之一的土地很少经过地质勘查，甚至于有些地区还完全未曾勘查过。就是已经开采的矿，由于过去帝国主义和反动统治者的掠夺，也从没有一个矿曾把地质情况弄清楚，这同样给今天地质工作带来很大困难。地质工作在这样一个任务繁重而力量又是很薄弱的情况下，这就须要大家首先很好地深刻地体会五年计划的基本精神，一方面要以发展重工业为重点来进行，另一方面也要为第二个和第三个五年计划创造条件。
    例如：在东北的北部和西北的天山一带，是储存有丰富而良好的煤田，我们应该在那些地区努力去寻找铁矿，以便发展成为钢铁工业基地。石油工业的发展，对于我们今天来说，具有非常重要的意义，我们必须要有信心地在西北各大盆地中以及全国各油源地进行勘探。对于这些工作，地质工作者要作很大的努力，同时，还必须得到全国广大人民共同重视与支持。
    再如在工作计划中，固然要大力的进行勘探，但同时也要组织一部分力量进行普查，务使普查不落后于勘探，勘探不落后于开采。在工作过程中，也要集中全国地质工作的力量，准备测制全国百万分之一地质图及四百万分之一的大地构造图，因为这是将来进行普查找矿的基本根据。
    第二、要大力培养地质人材，以适应祖国建设的需要。在国民党反动统治的二十多年当中，地质人员总共不过五百人，除了死亡及转业的以外，实际上在解放前时期做地质工作的不过一百多人，这一百多人还感到无事可做。解放以来，由于我国建设事业的迅速发展，地质人员便大大的感到不够。在政府的大力培养下，一九五二年全国成立了两个地质学院，并发展了六个大学的有关地质系或专业，几年来大专学校地质专业毕业的已超过三千人，还远赶不上实际工作的需要，目前许多重要厂矿还根本没有一个地质人员，至于水文工程地质人员和地球物理探矿人员那就更加感到缺乏了。上面已经说过，我们有广大的土地还没有经过地质勘查，而我们需要地下资源又如此迫切，所以培养地质人材，确也是我们的一个迫切而重要的任务。根据五年计划，地质方面要培养出的人材很多，这就必须在现有的基础上尽最大的努力来培养。
    关于培养方针：我们一定要贯彻全面教育。过去我们对于毛主席“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示体会不深，对学习苏联先进教学经验结合中国实际情况不够，以致学生学习负担过重，忽视了政治，妨碍了身体健康，培养出来的人材，不能尽量满足国家建设的需要。今后我们必须更好的体会毛主席“三好”的指示，更好的学习苏联先进经验并结合中国实际，不但要培养合乎规格的人材，而且争取招生一百，就要毕业一百，达到百分之百的培养任务。
    关于培养目标方面，我们地质勘探学院着重在培养矿产地质勘探，水文地质及工程地质，地球物理勘探，勘探工程等专业人材。过去由于我们缺乏生产经验，对于这些专业的培养目标还未能深入划分，以致影响到教学计划与教学大纲的制定，教材内容的编写，今后我们必须进一步来明确各专业的培养目标，然后按照教学计划、教学大纲来编定教材，务使培养出来的每一个地质人材都各有所长，也各有所用。再者，培养青年教师和提高干部业务水平也是我们的重大任务。
    第三、提高政治业务水平，增进工作效率，厉行节约，反对浪费。我觉得我们今天参加国家第一个五年的经济建设，是十分光荣的，但同时每一个人所担负的任务也是艰巨而重大的。我们要完成任务，必须从两方面来努力：一方面要加强马克思列宁主义学习，很好的学习辩证唯物主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义，深入学习苏联先进经验并开展科学研究，以提高我们的政治与业务水平，提高工作质量与效率。这一点对于一个地质工作者来说，更具有重要意义，因为他如果不从这方面去努力的话，就不光是能不能完成任务的问题，而且给国家所带来的损失，还将比一般都要大。譬如建设一个水力发电站的大水库，若地质基础没有弄好，一旦基础坏了，就不仅会使国家在财富与建设系统上造成巨大损失，甚至于还要危害到水坝下游人民的生命财产。再如矿产储量的勘探与估计，若达不到正确的要求，比方把只能开采十年的矿作了二十年的开采计划，联系到综合工厂的建设，交通线的建设，到时全部成了废物，带来的损失也是很严重的。所以地质工作应该从提高质量来努力，特别是更好的学习苏联先进经验。另一方面我们必须厉行节约，反对浪费。我们听了李富春副总理和李先念副总理的两个报告以后，觉得过去对于艰苦建国的精神体会很不够的。比方建造东北地质学院的时候，当时节约思想是没有的，存在着“造了也好”的铺张浪费思想，这种思想显然是与建设社会主义毫不相容的。我们今后要在基本建设方面吸取过去的经验教训，保证不应有浪费现象发生。关于技术不良在工作上所造成的损失，也同样要引起我们严重注意。过去地质勘探工作，在一部分地区或厂矿，由于不按照勘探规程进行，曾经打了很多不应打的钻，须知一个深钻常要花费几万至几十万元。再在设计方面，也由于地质情况未弄清，常不断出现返工现象，一个设计的返工，就不但造成浪费，还往往使施工计划延迟而影响一系列的建设。今后我们应该保证不浪费一个人，不浪费一个钻，不浪费一个设计，要经常用社会主义思想来检查我们的工作。
    第四、依靠群众，克服困难，努力完成任务。今后地质工作，特别是普查工作，绝不可能全是交通方便、人口稠密的地方，很可能是森林丛密，平沙千里，或是深壑峻谷，穷山僻壤的地方，这些地方可能覆盖很厚或是冰天雪地，地质调查是一定要遇到些困难的。这几年来，我们经过学习以及参加各项政治活动与建设工作，政治思想觉悟都有所提高，当然不会在这些困难前面低头的，但也不能说完全没有思想问题存在。比方说，怕跑到这些地方完成不了任务，或者认为对个人的提高不大，或者不愿意做这类工作，或者考虑到工作艰苦，这都是个人主义自由主义思想，我们必须加以根除。地质工作者很光荣地站在工业建设的最前列，我们一向是想为祖国建设，现在正是为人民做事的时候了，我相信，我们有了建设社会主义社会的信心，任何困难是阻挡不了我们前进的；依靠广大群众，任何困难都是可以克服的。再说，美帝国主义还在霸占着我们领土并阴谋发动新的战争，台湾为蒋匪帮盘踞还未得到解放，敌人对于我们有计划的进行建设是不会甘心的，一定会要多方面来进行破坏，我们必须提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，决不让任何反革命分子有活动的机会。
    国家第一个五年计划，关系到我们的建设基础，关系到我们全国人民的利益和子孙幸福，关系到巩固国防与保卫世界和平，我们一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，加强团结，百倍努力，为全部实现这个计划而奋斗。
    张鼎丞检察长的发言
    我完全同意和拥护我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案及一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算，完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国兵役法草案和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告以及邓子恢副总理所作的“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。
    我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，在中国共产党的领导下，由于国家机关和全国人民的努力，获得了重大的成就。现在我们又将通过我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。五年计划的通过和实施，将更加提高人民的政治觉悟，激发人民的劳动热情，使广大人民积极地参加国家的政治生活和经济建设事业，为努力建设和保卫我们的社会主义事业而奋斗。可以肯定，我们的社会主义建设事业将更有计划地大踏步地向前迈进，我们的人民民主专政的国家制度将更加巩固和发展。
    我们知道，社会主义的胜利就是敌人的失败，我们的社会主义事业胜利愈大，敌人就愈要作绝望的挣扎和疯狂的破坏。在全国解放以后，经过大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，我们已经肃清了大量的反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政，保障了国家经济建设的顺利进行。但是随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，美帝国主义制造侵略战争的阴谋和武装阻挠我解放台湾的侵略活动愈益加紧，国内外敌人和各种犯罪分子的破坏活动亦更加猖獗。蒋介石匪帮和帝国主义派遣的特务间谍分子和国内暗藏的残余反革命分子，针对我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业进行着各色各样更加阴险和更加隐蔽的破坏和暗藏活动。他们千方百计地设法打入和隐藏在我们的国家机关和工矿企业中，窃取机密，制造破坏事故和进行挑拨离间等活动。一个隐藏的反革命分子，就可以造成很大的破坏。例如暗藏在湖南省马田煤矿内的反革命分子梁中恕，纵火焚烧了该煤矿二工区的全部厂房，并因而引起井下瓦斯爆炸，死伤职工四十余人，使整个工区停工一个半月。在工商业者中间，绝大多数是拥护宪法、拥护社会主义改造的，但也有极少一部分坚决反抗社会主义改造的分子，公开地或秘密地进行着各种破坏活动。上海市人民检察院最近检察了一个长期藏匿在国营中国交通电工器材公司上海采购供应站内进行贪污盗窃活动的破坏集团。他们把持了该公司的采购、核价、供应三个主要环节，勾结不法资本家在外开设“地下工厂”，里应外合，大量地套购国家的电工器材，盗窃国家经济情报，并以假货顶真货等卑劣手段破坏国家经济建设。现已查明被他们贪污盗窃的国家财产达八万余元，而其直接间接对国家建设所造成的损失则是难以估计的。
    农村中的残余反革命分子、少数怙恶不悛的地主阶级分子和不法富农分子，针对农业生产互助合作运动和重要农产品的统购统销等工作，进行猖狂的破坏活动，甚至钻进合作社内部，窃据要害，篡夺领导，暗中进行破坏。一九五四年，仅在山西省就发生破坏农业生产合作社的重大案件五百六十余起。在全国著名的劳动模范李顺达、曲耀离、耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社中都曾混进过反革命分子进行破坏。反革命分子并利用各种空隙，制造反动谣言，煽动骚乱。如今年四月福建省邵武县发生的骚动事件，就是反革命分子煽动群众，破坏粮食统购统销和阴谋进行反攻复辟所造成的。在这一事件中，反革命分子进行了有组织的秘密活动，图谋夺取乡政权，并有计划地提出了一系列的反动口号，以“谁不参加就是有余粮，大家都到他家去吃”来胁迫群众参加骚动。反革命分子进行煽动骚乱的活动，一般是发生在“土改”、“镇反”很不彻底的落后区、乡中和我们疏忽麻痹的地方。这是必须引起我们严重的注意和警惕的。
    在城市和农村中的盗匪、流氓、骗子手等犯罪分子的破坏活动仍未彻底肃清。不少地方还发现了有组织的专门从事偷盗我国营工厂、企业和合作社资财的盗窃集团，这些集团有很多是以反革命分子为骨干的，或者是同反革命分子有密切联系的。
    特别值得我们警惕的，是暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子，他们是革命的最危险的敌人。敌人知道，中国共产党和人民政府在人民群众中具有无限的威信，人民民主政权已经十分强大和巩固，他们要公开反对共产党和人民政府是十分困难的，也是对他们十分不利的；敌人同样知道，堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的，因此反革命分子就采取最阴险、最隐蔽的斗争方式，以两面派手法伪装革命，钻进国家机关和共产党内，利用各种机会，从内部进行暗害破坏活动。已经揭露的胡风反革命集团和潘汉年反革命案件就是一个明显的例证。我们根据已查明的证据，已将潘汉年和胡风等罪犯依法逮捕审判。潘汉年、胡风等反革命案件的揭露，是一个很大的胜利。证明了只要我们提高警觉，我们就能够识破一切反革命分子的伪装，粉碎一切反革命分子的活动。
    全国解放后，人民公安机关、人民检察机关和人民审判机关，在全国人民积极支持下协同一致向反革命分子进行了不断的剧烈的斗争，肃清了很大一部分公开的暴露的反革命分子，使人民民主专政更加巩固，社会秩序更加安定。但是即使这种过去已经暴露的反革命分子也还残存了不小的一部分，必须继续加以镇压和肃清。至于采取两面派手法的暗藏反革命分子，我们还没有来得及全面地、彻底地加以揭露和处理。为了保卫第一个五年计划的胜利完成，保护社会主义建设事业的安全，必须采取坚决的有效的措施，加强对反革命分子及其他犯罪分子的斗争，揭露和肃清一切伪装的暗藏反革命分子，严厉镇压和惩治一切破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的反革命分子及其他犯罪分子的破坏活动。这是巩固人民民主政权、保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造顺利完成的一个重要的任务，是全国人民必须加以密切关心的工作。
    在肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争中，不仅公安、检察、法院等部门要密切配合，而且要依靠广大群众的积极参加。因此必须在广大干部和人民群众中进行广泛深入的肃清暗藏反革命分子的宣传教育工作，提高干部和人民群众的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，彻底克服对反革命的破坏活动熟视无睹的右倾思想和太平观念。在领导机关的正确指导下，只要广大群众动员和警觉起来，任何伪装的敌人都一定会被我们揭露，任何反革命分子都逃不出人民的法网。
    为了严厉地、正确地打击反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，保护人民的民主权利，必须严格地执行国家的法律。对于一切进行破坏活动，应当逮捕的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，必须坚决地逮捕起来，依法予以严厉惩办。要彻底纠正和克服目前某些地方存在的该捕不捕、该判不判、重罪轻判等右的偏向，同时严格防止和纠正不经法定手续进行拘捕和审讯的非法行为以及错捕、错判的现象。必须不断地加强人民民主法制的建设，加强人民的检察工作，以便同人民公安机关、人民法院协同一致，有效地镇压一切反革命的阴谋破坏活动和惩治各种破坏国家和人民利益的违法犯罪行为。
    在宪法和人民检察院组织法颁布后，各级人民检察院根据积极建设、有步骤地发展的方针，积极贯彻执行人民检察院组织法，有计划、有步骤地建设人民检察院的组织与业务。目前全国检察机构已由宪法颁布时的一、一九九个增至一、九六三个；检察干部已由六、九六三人增至一二、一五五人。各级人民检察院结合国家在这一时期的各项任务，积极地、有重点地开展各项业务工作。首先是抓紧进行了审查批准逮捕人犯工作和重要刑事案件的侦查、起诉工作，按照中华人民共和国逮捕拘留条例的规定，认真严肃地审查了公安机关要求批准逮捕人犯的案件，其中绝大多数的案件，都是经过了公安机关充分地侦查、具有了确凿的证据，因而都及时地批准予以逮捕；对于有些侦查不够充分、证据不足的，则送还公安机关补充侦查；对于没有构成犯罪不应当逮捕的，则不批准逮捕，但这只是审批案件中的极少数。在刑事案件的侦查、起诉工作中，各级人民检察院审查起诉了公安机关侦查破获的特务间谍等重大反革命案件，并直接侦查起诉了不少的破坏国家经济建设和各项中心工作的犯罪案件。最高人民检察院先后于一九五四年十月九日和一九五五年五月二十日向最高人民法院军事审判庭公诉了美国间谍特务唐奈、张载文等十一人偷入我国国境进行特务活动危害我国安全的案件，美国间谍阿诺德等十一人乘用飞机偷越我国国境进行间谍活动危害我国安全的案件，以及美国空军人员帕克斯等四人驾驶美国军用飞机侵入我国领空进行骚扰挑衅危害我国安全的案件，使这些帝国主义的特务间谍分子和侵犯我国领空的犯罪分子受到我国法律的审判和惩罚。对于监所和劳动改造机关的工作，各级人民检察院也有重点地进行了检查，协同有关部门严厉处理在押罪犯的破坏活动，并检查纠正对犯人的看管教育中的不当措施。上述工作，对于打击反革命分子及其他犯罪分子，保障法律的正确实施，保护国家社会主义事业的安全，起了积极的作用。
    在我们工作中，也存在着不少的缺点和错误。目前人民检察机关的组织机构还不够健全，因而还不能完全担负起它的全部任务。并且在一部分检察干部中，由于满足于过去镇压反革命运动的成绩，没有充分认识到当前敌人破坏活动的严重性，而滋长着一种极端危险的轻敌麻痹情绪。对于这种倾向虽已有所警惕和批判，但还未得到彻底的克服。有些地区的检察干部，对革命法制的重要性认识不足，或者机械地搬运法律条文，陷于繁琐的文牍主义，脱离了当前的实际斗争。这些缺点和错误的发生，虽然同缺乏工作经验有一定的关系，但也是同最高人民检察院的政治思想领导和业务领导不够分不开的。对于这些缺点和错误，我们正在努力地加以克服。
      今后必须在加强对反革命分子及其他犯罪分子的斗争中继续加强人民检察院的组织建设和业务建设，建立一支组织上、政治上、业务上健全而坚强的检察工作队伍，充分发挥检察工作在巩固革命法制、保障国家建设中应有的作用。按照普遍建立、逐步健全的方针，继续努力，把尚未建立的地方各级人民检察院建立起来，有计划地建立铁路、水上运输检察院和筹备建立军事检察院。同时应从当前实际情况出发，有计划、有步骤地建立人民检察院的各项业务工作。
    各级人民检察院在实现五年计划的斗争中必须努力加强自己的工作，依靠广大群众的支持和其他国家机关的配合，坚决地向一切反革命分子和各种违法犯罪分子进行斗争，保卫五年计划的顺利进行。我们坚定地相信：全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，努力奋斗，我国第一个五年计划是一定能够胜利完成的，建设社会主义的伟大事业是一定会取得完全胜利的。
    马腾霭代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护第一个五年计划草案和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭德怀副总理、彭真副委员长和邓子恢副总理的报告。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“我们集中力量发展工业，但决不能够减轻发展农业的意义。没有农业的相应发展，我们的工业化事业是不可能实现的。”而目前我国发展农业的根本办法。就是要积极地有步骤地开展农业的合作化运动，特别是发展以土地入股、统一经营为特点的农业生产合作社。这不但是增加生产的有效办法，而且是对农业实行社会主义改造的必要途径。
    我的工作地区是甘肃省的吴忠回族自治州。这是一个回汉民族杂居的农业区。解放以来，随着土地改革的完成，回汉人民要求组织起来，发展农业生产。尤其是经过国家过渡时期总任务和宪法的宣传教育以后，人民群众参加互助合作运动的积极性更加提高，因而农业合作化运动有了显著的进展。目前自治州共有二百七十七个农业生产合作社，其中由回民组成的有八十九个社，由汉民组成的有一百二十四个社，回汉人民联合组成的有六十四个社；并有三千二百多个互助组，其中有一千二百多个常年组；参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农户占农户总数的百分之五十八。组织起来，互助合作，走社会主义道路，已经成为回汉人民的共同愿望。正是由于农业合作化运动的发展，加之群众采取了各种有效的增产措施，自治州的粮食产量逐年增长，一九五四年的产量超过原计划的百分之三十五，一九五五年计划比一九五四年增加百分之七。
    在民族杂居的农业区开展合作化运动，正如其他任何工作一样，必须从民族团结出发，充分注意到民族特点。这就是说，要在民族之间和民族内部团结的基础上去发展互助合作组织，而一切互助合作组织，特别是农业生产合作社，不论在组织形式或生产活动等方面都应当处处照顾民族特点。不能够与一般地区强求一律，或者不加区别地搬用一般地区的经验。事实证明，凡是这样做了的，不但发展了生产，而且加强了民族团结。从吴忠回族自治州的建社工作中，我们有以下几点体会：
    第一，在向群众宣传建社时，必须结合进行民族政策的教育。尤其要着重地反复地说明在农业生产合作社中如何具体贯彻民族政策，以解除群众的思想顾虑。同时进行民族统战工作，取得民族宗教上层人士的赞助，也是很必要的。
    第二，正确贯彻农村阶级政策和自愿互利的原则，本着民族平等团结的精神，采取民族协商的方式，慎重妥善地处理社内一切问题，防止包办代替或者强迫命令。因为这不仅关系到依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农的问题，还关系到民族之间和民族内部的团结问题。
    第三，在回汉人民联合组成的农业生产合作社内，要特别注意互相尊重风俗习惯和宗教信仰。譬如回汉社员不愿意合用一口水井，可以分别打井，分别使用。不习惯男女一齐劳动的，可以分别编队编组，分别劳动。社内养猪，可以由汉民社员单独饲养，不作为全社副业。这样一些问题，只要解决得好，社就更加巩固，社内也更加团结。同时，在社的干部配备方面，也要照顾到回汉民族的适当人选。
    此外，吴忠回族自治州大部分是大型水利灌溉区，一部分是干旱区。因此，在领导农业生产上，必须依靠群众组织起来的力量，因地制宜地采取有效的增产办法。在前一类地区，主要是做好水利工作，扩大灌溉面积；在后一类地区，主要是做好水土保持工作，逐步改变自然面貌，并根据可能条件，有计划地发展畜牧业和副业。
    各位代表，建设社会主义是我国各民族人民伟大的共同事业。我们必须在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，团结一致，增加生产，厉行节约，争取各个战线上的不断胜利，为全部完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    朱学范部长的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，并热烈拥护我国第一个五年计划的实施；我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告，并愿为实现我国第一个五年计划和一九五五年国家预算，同全国人民和全体邮电职工一起共同努力。
    我们国家，从一九五三年开始，进入了第一个五年计划的建设时期，全国人民都在为了国家的伟大建设而共同努力。我国第一个五年计划的完成，将开始改变我国经济落后的历史面貌，向着社会主义社会的目标前进一步。第一个五年计划期间，我们邮电建设的主要方面，是加强首都同各重要城市和新的工业城市的通信联系，并配合新工业城市建设的需要，同时积极地整顿并稳步地发展乡村的通信事业。在国家建设期间，邮电企业应该提高业务和技术水平，注意通信科学的研究工作，改进经营管理，提高设备利用率和工作质量，以适应国家和人民对邮电通信的需要，这是全体邮电工作人员当前最主要的努力方向。
    邮电企业是国民经济的组成部分，是国家的通信部门，是人民群众相互联络的重要工具。“邮电通信因为能够缩短时间来克服空间，缩短生产和流转的时间，所以可以促进社会主义扩大再生产的加速。”近代化的生产和社会一切活动，都需要利用邮政、电报、电话等等通信联络工具。通过邮电通信，传达国家政令，沟通各地情况，联系国内外各方面的关系，并配合国防需要。国家各个经济部门，各企业、机关、学校、团体以及人民群众，时时刻刻都需要邮电通信的服务。
    邮电工作的整个生产过程，也就是使用邮电者的消费过程。它并不生产任何商品，但它的劳动结果，是产生一种对社会生产有益的效能。对于邮电工作，不能像衡量一般商品好坏那样去衡量的，只能从使用者所获得的效果去体现它的成绩好坏。因此衡量邮电工作的尺度是：迅速、准确、安全、方便。在邮件、电信的传递过程中，就绝对不容许有差错、延误、遗失、损毁和盗窃等等事故的发生，尤其重要的是要确保国家通信机密。
    随着整个国家建设事业的发展，邮电企业的发展也是非常显著的。以北京为中心，沟通全国各地的通信网基本上构成了。现在全国县以上的长途电信线路比一九四九年增加了将近一倍。全国各省人民委员会所在地和主要工业城市，同北京都能直接通达电报和长途电话，从省会到县城绝大部分能够通达电报和长途电话，县城和区、乡之间很多地方也已经能够通达电报和长途电话。一九五○年在苏联的帮助和合作下，建立了北京到莫斯科的直达有线电报、长途电话的电信线路，这条线路的总长度将近
  一万公里，它标志着中苏两大盟邦的牢不可破的团结和友谊。在邮政方面，全国的邮路已经长达一百六十四万多公里，比一九四九年增加了一倍还多，从前去西藏的邮路要经过外国转口，自从康藏、青藏两条公路修建通车后，我们的邮车已经很快地从内地直接伸展到遥远的西藏，现在从北京寄一封信到拉萨，如果班次衔接的话，只要十六天工夫就能到达。北起满洲里，南至海南岛，东起沿海，西到边疆，都已经能够直接地很快地传递邮件了。在国际事务上邮电通信联系也日益发展，我们同苏联、朝鲜、蒙古、越南以及欧洲各兄弟国家的邮件交换和电报、电话的通信都是非常密切的。我们已经和世界上四十一个国家有了直接通信联系。
    根据邮电工作的特点和它在国家政治、经济、文化建设和人民日常物质、文化生活上所应起的作用，对于邮电工作的基本要求，就是必须保证良好的质量。邮电部对于消灭差错、加速运转投递、防止遗失损毁以及杜绝贪污盗窃、确保机密等等，曾经采取了不少措施，也有一定的改进。但是检查起来，距离我们的要求还是很远的，直到现在为止，各种影响质量的事故仍然不断地发生，尤其使人不能容忍的是反革命分子时有破坏以及贪污盗窃和泄露国家机密的情况还没有完全肃清，其中有些情节是非常恶劣的。这是邮电部门存在问题中的一个主要问题，今后必须加以克服的。
    我想在这里再简单谈谈报刊发行和乡邮问题、邮政代办所问题、县内电话（地方电信）问题。
    先谈谈报刊发行和乡邮问题。报刊发行工作是邮电部门重要的政治任务。从一九五○年起，邮电部全面担负起这一任务。几年来在各地党、政机关的指导和支持下，报纸和杂志的发行工作，得到了迅速的发展。现在全国邮电局发行报纸的期发数（即每一期的发行份数）已达到一千一百十二万份，比一九五○年增加了百分之四百零八，杂志每期也达到一千四百八十六万份，比一九五二年增加了百分之二百三十九，今后必然将有更大的发展。但是现在全国还有百分之二十五的乡，我们的乡邮员不能到达，至于乡以下的村，那就大部分要依靠便人捎转了。这样就很难把报纸和杂志普遍地、及时地递送下去。在乡村中目前存在着报刊收订不上来、投递不下去的现象，同时乡村邮件投递、收寄工作也同样存在这一情况。这是一个应该积极而逐步解决的重要问题。我们目前还不可能普遍设置邮电机构和大量增加乡村投递人员，否则势必过多地增加国家财政的支出。同时，苏联的集体农庄邮递员制度也是我们应走的方向。因此，现在一方面，邮电部门要积极挖掘潜在力量，合理调整乡村邮路，逐步增设服务机构和乡邮人员，另一方面还需要组织社会力量。目前邮电部门正在通过地方党、政机关，在各地组织义务乡邮站，以扩大报刊推广网和邮电服务面。现在山西、河北两省和东北各省已经普遍建立了义务乡邮站。事实证明，义务乡邮站的人员所费时间并不多，而村内居民在订阅报刊、收寄邮件上，却得到了很大的方便。这一工作还需要各机关和有关部门给以大力的支持和协助，这样两方面结合起来，才能逐步解决乡村邮政中需要和可能的矛盾。此外，在条件成熟的地方，还可以试行农业生产合作社邮递员制度。
    其次关于邮政代办所问题。乡村的邮政业务中，有一部分要依靠代办所来进行。过去的代办所绝大部分是私商和私人代办，由于这些代办人的成份复杂，常有盗窃信件、汇款和泄露机密等事情发生，损害国家和人民的利益。过去我们对于这种情况是了解不够认识不足的。一九五三年毛主席正确地指出，邮电企业的整顿工作必须从上到下地深入到代办所去，给了我们很大的启发。我们对于私商代办所进行了有计划的全面整顿工作，一九五四年内检查出贪污的代办人就有三千五百二十六人，新旧的贪污款项共达四十七万元。其中有些情节是很严重的，例如河南唐河一个代办所检查出来贪污一千多元中，有八百四十多元是中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军军人的赡家汇款和烈士抚恤金。这些不法代办人为了达到贪污的目的，就毁灭信件，断绝军人同家属的联系，甚至扯谎说：某某军人牺牲了，有一个军人家属因此哭坏了双眼。其他情节恶劣的事例还很多。通过对代办所的整顿，那些不法代办人都已由政府按照情节轻重分别依法处理了。已经整顿的代办所，大部分转由供销合作社以及其他国营企业代办。我们对于代办所的方针是除了部分收回自办而外，要在一定时期以内，把私商成份代办的邮政代办所稳步地转托由社会主义或半社会主义性质的机构、企业代办。根据我们的了解，凡是已经转到合作社代办的，群众普遍反映比私人代办可靠并且方便得多。比如领得汇款时直接就可以买到所需要的东西，更不会再像私人代办时的积压拖欠甚至被窃。为了保证邮电工作的质量，对于代办所进行整顿是必要的，也只有把代办所放在社会主义和半社会主义的可靠基础上，才能使邮电工作质量提高，不致于在代办所这一个环节上受到损害。
    再次谈一下县内电话也就是地方电信问题。地方电信是县级党政机关指导农村工作的重要通信工具，它与农业社会主义改造具有极密切的关系。几年来地方电信有了很大发展，这是完全必要的。根据第二次全国省市计划会议的有关决定，第一个五年计划期间对于县以下的地方电信，应该是以加强维修现有的设备为主，有重点地进行整顿，以逐步改善通话质量；只在十分必要和地方财力许可的情况下，才能新建，它的建设经费要在地方财政预算中统筹支出。目前邮电部门在代管工作中还存在着维护很差、管理混乱、通话质量不高等缺点，同时由于没有统一的收费制度，因此有些地方在使用上存在着供给制思想，某些地方干部常常一次通话一两小时讲不完，造成了很大浪费。为了克服以上缺点，邮电部正在拟订地方电信的建设标准，经营管理的规章制度和收费标准，以逐步改善地方电话的质量，并加强对地方电信的管理。要改变供给制经营管理的情况，今后地方电信应该收取一定的资费，以减轻地方上的维护费用，逐步达到合理的经营管理。按照国务院最近指示，县内的电话经营仍由各省人民委员会负责，委托邮电部门代管，因之我们邮电部门一定要负责做好地方电信的工作。
    邮电企业在国家过渡时期中的基本任务是：为不断增长的工农业生产、商品交流和人民物质、文化生活的需要服务；并为国防服务。为此，我们必须按照苏联社会主义邮电通信的先进技术标准，有计划、有步骤地，但是贯彻到底地改造我国邮电企业的技术，以期在相当时期内达到苏联现有邮电通信的先进技术标准；对于邮电企业中只利于资本主义不利于社会主义的因素，坚决而有步骤地进行改造，并建立社会主义企业管理原则和制度；不断提高工作效能，加强保密，改善服务态度，以保证党和政府的命令、决议、指示、文电、报刊和函件的及时而准确地下达和传递。
    为了实现上述任务，邮电部门当前的主要工作是整顿组织机构，建立和健全业务管理制度，厉行节约，不断改进企业管理。预计在全国邮电系统内进行整编之后，将可精简管理人员八千人以上，用以充实现业单位的生产工作和增加、扩充邮电服务机构；同时建立和健全各种业务制度，改进工作方法和工作作风，不断提高工作效率。为了积累国家建设资金，邮电部门已初步拟订了在三年内节约三千二百万元的计划。我们将尽最大努力，保证完成和争取超额完成这一节约计划。我们还要加强对敌斗争，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，以进一步纯洁邮电部门的组织，并坚持不懈地向贪污盗窃、违法乱纪现象作斗争，加强保密，提高工作质量。
    在中国共产党和国务院的正确领导下，在各部门的支持和广大人民的监督、帮助之下，通过全体邮电职工的共同努力，我们将满怀信心地实现第一个五年计划中规定的邮电部门的发展计划，以便更好地为国家建设和人民的需要服务。
    安文钦代表的发言
    自解放后，我中央人民政府成立以来，凡应兴应革的事业，莫不次第举行，积极整理，登诸报端，无容赘述。然有一得之愚，申明在案，请采择焉。如毛主席英明领导下，将中国从前外交上的失败和耻辱，以及亡国条件洗刷的干干净净，以争取国际间之平等，列于世界上富强大国之一，赫赫奕奕，蓬蓬勃勃，蒸然有日上之势。虽然我希望政府诸公毋骄傲，毋自满，满而必溢，骄则必慢，影响国家实有不堪设想者。仍须提高警惕，虚怀若谷。更希望诸公莫忘了二万五千里长征毛儿盖的困难，尤其是六万万人民现在安居乐业，丰衣足食，更希望人民莫忘了蒋贼黑暗统治下压迫我们，奴役我们。恭读“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，细味之，第觉耳目一新，茅塞顿开，字字珠玉，句句金石，都从肺腑中流出，诚为医国之良剂，济世之慈航，凡有血气者，所以一致地坚决地拥护到底。关于胡风的破坏祖国有二十年的阴谋丑恶历史，如老虎带佛冠，掩其不善而著其善，蛊惑国家，麻醉人民，等于糖饯砒霜，令人饮之而不自知也。今则彻底披露矣。至于仆从走狗，一网打尽，勿遗星星之火，燎原莫扑。从此上下一致，军民团结，努力生产，厉行节约，支援前线。卧榻之侧，不容他人鼾睡，一定要解放台湾，歼灭蒋贼卖国集团，驱逐美帝出境，解救台湾八百万同胞于水火之中，措诸衽席之上，回到祖国怀抱，享受此平等的自由的光荣幸福于无暨矣。引领以望之，馨香以祝之，其各勉旃。
