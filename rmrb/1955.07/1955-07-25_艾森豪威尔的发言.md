Eisenhower's Speech

Mr. Chairman, gentlemen:

    I welcome the spirit of friendship and goodwill expressed in the speeches of the previous two speakers, and I reciprocate it warmly. However, I very much hope that my silence regarding certain parts of the speech of the latter speaker will never be interpreted as my acquiescence. Far from it.

    But, it seems to me that in the final minutes of the meeting, there is no need to declare to this conference, and to the world, the attitude of the United States on some of the important questions we have discussed.

    I hope and believe that these have been clarified. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to restate them in detail once again. I would rather mention our work of the past week and express some hopes for our future work.

    This is a meeting of historical significance. On the whole, it has been a good week. But only history can tell the true value of our meeting together. The follow-up actions taken by our respective governments from this beginning will be decisive in assessing this meeting.

    We have frankly discussed some extremely difficult and complex issues that concern our respective peoples – and indeed the people of the whole world.

    We did not come here to reach final solutions. We came to see if we could find together a path that would lead to solutions and brighten the prospects for world peace. At this final moment of our meeting, my personal estimate is that the prospects for a lasting peace with justice, happiness, and greater freedom are brighter than before. The danger of the overwhelming tragedy of modern war is less than before.

    The work of our foreign ministers in trying to implement our instructions will be very important, perhaps even more important than what we have done here. Their task is to agree on the course of action we have only been able to discuss in general terms, a task that reflects the substantive policies of their governments. I know we all wish them well.

    I believe that we will all support the necessary adjustments that our respective governments may have to make if they are to resolve our differences on these issues.

    If our peoples, in the years to come, expand their knowledge and understanding of each other, as we have expanded our knowledge of each other in this one week, then it may be easier to reach further agreements between our governments. May this happen in a spirit of justice. May its results increase happiness, expand freedom, reduce the fear of human suffering, and may it manifest itself in greater goodwill among mankind. Then these days will truly remain in people's memory forever.

    I came to Geneva because I believe humanity longs to be freed from war and the rumors of war. I came here because I have unwavering faith in the upright instincts and conscience of the people who inhabit our world. I will return home tonight with these unshaken beliefs, and with the prayer that humanity's hopes will one day be realized.

### 艾森豪威尔的发言

专栏：

    艾森豪威尔的发言主席先生，各位先生：
    我欢迎前面两位发言者的发言中表现的友好和善意的精神，并且热烈地报之以同样的精神，但是我十分希望，我对其中后一位发言者的发言中的某些部分保持沉默的做法将决不被人解释为我的默认。远不是这样。
    但是，据我看来，在会议的最后几分钟里，我似乎没有必要向本会议以及全世界宣布美国在我们讨论过的一些重要问题上所持的态度。
    我希望并且认为这些已经得到阐明。因此，再一次详细地把它们重述一遍似乎是不顶合适的。我倒愿意提一提我们过去一星期的工作和表示一下对我们今后工作的某些希望。
    这是一次具有历史意义的会议。总的说来，这是一个很好的星期。但是只有历史才能说明我们这次在一起开会的真正价值。我们各自的政府从这一开端所采取的后继行动，对于估量这次会议将具有决定性的意义。
    我们坦率地讨论了一些同我们几国人民有关——而且的确同全世界人民有关——的极其困难复杂的问题。
    我们不是来这里达成最后的解决办法的。我们来是为了了解我们是否可能在一起找出将导致解决
  办法并且将使世界和平的前途变得光明的道路。在这我们会议的最后一刻，我个人的估计是，实现一种具有正义、幸福和更广泛的自由的持久和平的前途是比前光明了。发生现代战争的压倒一切的悲剧的危险比以前小了。
    我们的外交部长们在努力设法执行我们的指示时的工作将是十分重要的，也许比我们在这里所做的工作更为重要。他们的任务是就我们在这里只能泛泛地讨论的行动路线达成协议，这种任务反映出他们的政府的实质的政策。我知道我们大家都祝他们顺利。
    我相信，对于他们可能发现我们几国政府如果要解决我们在这些问题上的分歧就必须作的一些必要的调整，我们大家是一定会支持的。
    如果我们各国人民，在今后的年月里，像我们在这一个星期中扩大了我们对彼此的认识一样，扩大他们对彼此的认识和了解，那末就可能便于我们几国政府之间达成进一步的协议。愿这种事情发生在正义的精神中。愿它的结果将增进幸福，扩大自由，减少对人类遭受苦难的恐惧心理，愿它表现为人类之间的更大的善意。那末这些日子将真正地永远留在人们的记忆中。
    我之所以到日内瓦来，是因为我相信人类渴望摆脱战争和战争的谣言。我之所以到这里来，是因为我对于居住于我们这个世界上的人们的正直的本能和良知具有不渝的信心。我今晚回国时将带着这些不曾动摇的信念，带着这样的祈祷：人类的希望有一天将会实现。
