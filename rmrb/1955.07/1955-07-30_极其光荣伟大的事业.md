    An Extremely Glorious and Great Undertaking
    By our reporters Fu Zhen and Bai Sheng
    Beijing, in Huai Ren Tang Hall, has been filled with a joyous and inspiring atmosphere for days. Representatives of the National People's Congress, representing the 600 million people of the motherland, are diligently and enthusiastically discussing the blueprint for our country's socialist construction – the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, despite the sweltering summer heat of Beijing this year.

    At the First Session of the National People's Congress, Chairman Mao once said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done." Now, during the discussion of the Five-Year Plan, many representatives have quoted this famous saying and used their own personal experiences to illustrate the achievements our country has already made and will achieve in this extremely glorious and great undertaking.

    The Five-Year Plan specifically showcases the bright and beautiful prospects of our country. This prospect inspires the people of the whole country and will become the goal of their hard work. Today, it first inspires the representatives of the National People's Congress, who represent the will of the people, causing them to express their support with boundless excitement and emotion.

    Here, He Xiangning, a 77-year-old representative, was helped to the front of the rostrum, expressing the ardent hope of millions of overseas Chinese for the construction of a great motherland; Representative Shen Junru, with his flowing beard, stood at the speaker's stand, listening to others reading his opinions on his behalf; Representative Ma Xulun, who attended the meeting despite illness, said that he had "never been so excited and happy as he is now"; Representative Xirao Jiacuo, dressed in Tibetan yellow robes, expressed his support for the Five-Year Plan in his native language; Meng Tai, a piping worker and model worker from the motherland's steel construction base with 38 years of work experience, expressed the working class's determination to realize the Five-Year Plan in connection with the situation of "Anshan Iron and Steel"; Representative Zhang Huiting, an old farmer who was illiterate in the past, brilliantly illustrated the peasants' will to advance on the socialist road with examples from himself and the agricultural producers' cooperative to which he belonged.

    Representatives came to the rostrum one by one, using their different identities, from different jobs, and from each person's different experiences, vividly illustrating the rapid development of our country and portraying the great achievements already made in socialist construction.

    Scientific and technical workers feel deeply about the Five-Year Plan. In old China, for many years, they cherished the ideal of "saving the country through industry" and prepared to dedicate their wisdom to their country; but all they got was disappointment and pain. Now, the situation has completely changed, and the era of "no place for heroes" is gone forever! Railway engineer Wang Jupian said that the projects he had participated in during the short six years after liberation greatly exceeded what he had done in the more than 20 years before liberation. Geologist Yu Deyuan said that in the years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, there were only 500 geologists in the whole country, and only more than 100 actually did geological work, and even those 100 people felt that there was nothing to do at that time. But after liberation, due to the development of construction, more than 3,000 geology graduates from colleges and universities have been trained in the past few years, but they still cannot keep up with the actual needs.

    In the first two years of the implementation of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, many aspects have already achieved brilliant victories. The representatives unanimously praised these construction achievements in their speeches.

    Anshan, the motherland's steel base, has been rapidly built into four new automated blast furnaces in the past two years with the help of the Soviet Union and the support of the people from all over the country. The newly built large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube mill, and second thin plate mill have also been put into production. Representative Meng Tai excitedly reported these encouraging good news to the representatives.

    In the past two years, geologists have tirelessly explored the deep mountains and wilderness of the motherland and discovered considerable reserves of major minerals such as iron, copper, lead, tin, and coal, providing the necessary mineral raw materials and fuel bases for the country's steel enterprises. In the past two years, geologists have also carried out important river basin geological surveys and geological surveys for various water conservancy projects, providing the necessary geological data for the design of the country's massive construction projects.

    In the past two years, our railways have completed 40 percent of the five-year construction plan. The two railways that the people have been looking forward to for many years, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which are difficult to construct, are being built at an accelerated pace, and the two world-famous highways, the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, were opened to traffic at the end of 1954. The opening of these two highways has greatly improved the transportation between Tibet and the outside world, and strengthened the unity between the Tibetan people and the fraternal nationalities of the motherland.

    Our country's first automobile manufacturing plant will be completed and start producing a large number of automobiles during the first Five-Year Plan. The start of construction of our country's first tractor manufacturing plant, the restoration and putting into production of the Yumen Oilfield, an oil city in the Gobi Desert of Northwest China, the putting into production of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine, the first large-scale open-pit coal mine in New China, and the completion of the newly built first large-scale ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in our country... These great achievements in the motherland's economic construction in the past two years have inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build a socialist society.

    All of these are the achievements we have already made. On this basis, we will achieve even greater achievements. By the time the first Five-Year Plan is completed, we will see: countless deep mountains will become treasure houses producing abundant resources, and many wildernesses will become factories with towering chimneys; the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will continue to extend, advancing towards the Gobi Desert of Xinjiang, and the Yangtze River Bridge will be built intensively, rising above the Yangtze River in the three towns of Wuhan; more power stations will be built, emitting a large amount of light and heat, supplying the needs of industrial production and residents' lives, and a large number of tractor stations will be established, with tractors galloping across the fields, which will more forcefully promote the development of agricultural cooperation; more importantly, with the help of the Soviet Union, our country will begin to use atomic energy for construction within five years, so that it can serve the national economy. These are not fantasies, and in a few years, we will see the benefits it brings to our country.

    The representatives not only depicted the bright prospects of our country, but also pointed out how we should be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage. Jiang Xueshan, representative of the famous "Tower Hill Hero Regiment," said: We are always on the alert, and we will never be paralyzed or careless. We will never allow any aggressor to break into our motherland's garden. This sentence represents the will of the army and the will of the people of the whole country.

    Chairman Mao said: "Our goal must be achieved. Our goal can certainly be achieved." Past facts have proved the correctness of these two sentences, and future facts will continue to prove the correctness of these two sentences.

    极其光荣伟大的事业
    本报记者傅真　柏生
    北京，怀仁堂里，连日来洋溢着一片欢欣鼓舞的气氛。代表祖国六万万人民的全国人民代表大会的代表们，不顾北京今年夏天的酷热，紧张热烈地讨论我国建设社会主义的蓝图——发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    在全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，毛主席曾经说过：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”现在，在讨论五年计划的时候，不少的代表引用了这句名言，并且用自己切身的经历和体验，说明我们的国家在这个极其光荣伟大的事业中已经取得的成就和将要达到的成就。
    五年计划具体地展示了我们国家光明美丽的远景。这个远景鼓舞了全国人民，并将成为全国人民努力奋斗的目标。今天，它首先鼓舞了代表人民意志的全国人民代表大会的代表，使他们以无限兴奋和激动的心情倾吐出自己的拥护之忱。
    在这里，七十七岁高龄的何香凝代表由别人搀扶着走向了主席台前，说出了千百万华侨对于建设伟大祖国的热望；长髯飘拂的沈钧儒代表站立在发言席上，倾听着别人代替自己宣读的意见；带病出席大会的马叙伦代表说他“从来没有像现在这样兴奋和愉快”；身着藏族黄色衣衫的喜饶嘉错代表用本民族语言说出自己对五年计划的拥护；来自祖国钢铁建设基地、有了三十八年工龄的配管工人、劳动模范孟泰联系“鞍钢”情况表示了工人阶级实现五年计划的决心；过去不识字的老农民张会亭代表用他自己和他所在的农业生产合作社的例证精彩地说明了农民向社会主义道路前进的意志。
    代表们一个一个地走上主席台前，他们以不同的身份、从不同的工作岗位、从每一个人不同的经历，生动地说明了我们国家飞跃的发展，描绘了社会主义建设事业中已经获得的伟大成就。
    科学技术工作者们对五年计划感触很深。在旧中国，多少年来，他们怀着“工业救国”的理想，准备为自己的国家献出自己的智慧；可是得到的只是失望和痛苦。现在，情况完全改变了，“英雄无用武之地”的时代永远永远地过去了！铁路工程师汪菊潜代表说，他在解放后短短六年之中所参加的工程，大大地超过了解放前二十多年所做的。地质工作者喻德渊代表说，国民党反动统治的年代中，全国地质工作者总共不过五百人，而实际做地质工作的又不过一百多人，这一百多人那时还感到无事可做。可是解放以后，由于建设事业的发展，几年来已经培养了三千多名大专学校地质系毕业学生，还是赶不上实际需要。
    祖国第一个五年计划实施的头两年，许多方面已经取得了辉煌的胜利。这些建设成就，代表们在他们的发言中都异口同声地歌颂着。
    祖国钢铁基地鞍山，两年来在苏联的帮助和全国各地人民的支援下，飞跃地建设成四座新的自动化炼铁炉。新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第二薄板厂，也都投入了生产。孟泰代表激动地向代表们报告了这些鼓舞人心的喜讯。
    两年来，地质工作者们不辞艰辛地在祖国的深山荒野里勘探出铁、铜、铅、锡、煤等主要矿种的相当大的储量，为国家的钢铁企业提供了必需的矿物原料和燃料基地。两年来地质工作者还进行了重要的流域地质勘察和各种水利工程的地质勘察工作，为国家的巨大建设工程的设计提供了必需的地质资料。
    两年来，我们的铁路已经完成了五年修建计划的百分之四十。人民多少年来就盼望的两条工程艰巨的铁路——兰新铁路和宝成铁路正在加紧修筑，两条世界闻名的公路——康藏和青藏公路，已经在一九五四年年底通车了。这两条公路的通车，大大改善了西藏地方和外界的交通，并且加强了藏族和祖国各兄弟民族之间的团结。
    我国第一座汽车制造厂，在第一个五年计划期间就要建成并开始生产出大量的汽车。我国第一座拖拉机制造厂的动工兴建，大西北戈壁滩上的石油城玉门油矿的修复和投入生产，新中国第一座露天煤矿阜新海州露天煤矿的投入生产，新建的我国第一条规模最大的超高压送电线的完工……这些两年来祖国经济建设方面已经取得的巨大成就，鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义社会的热情。
    所有这些，都是我们已经取得的成就。在这个基础上，我们将取得更大的成就。在第一个五年计划完成时，我们将会看到：无数的深山将变成出产丰富资源的宝库，不少的旷野将成为烟囱林立的工厂；兰新铁路继续延伸，向着新疆的戈壁滩挺进，长江大桥紧张兴建，将在武汉三镇的江面上突起；更多的电站建立起来了，放送出大量的光和热，供应工业生产和居民生活的需要，大批的拖拉机站建立起来了，拖拉机在田野上奔驰，将更有力地促进农业合作化的发展；更重要的，在苏联帮助下，五年内我国将开始利用原子能的建设，使之为国民经济服务。这些，都不是幻想，几年之后，我们将会看到它给我们的国家带来的利益。
    代表们不仅描绘了我们国家的光明远景，而且也提出我们应该如何警惕敌人的破坏。著名的“塔山英雄团”团长江雪山代表说：我们时刻都在警惕着，毫不麻痹大意，决不允许任何侵略者闯进我们祖国的大花园。这句话代表了部队的意志，也代表了全国人民的意志。
    毛主席说：“我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”过去的事实已经证明这两句话的正确，今后的事实还将继续证明这两句话的正确。
