　　Extravagant Celebration Assembly
　　Editor:
　　On February 15th of this year, the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau held an extravagant celebration assembly for the transfer of the Shuangyashan Vertical Shaft Coal Mine to production, spending more than 8,000 yuan.
　　Many of the expenses of the celebration were unnecessary. For example, the decoration of the venue and the making of red flags used a total of 1,450 feet of satin fabric, costing more than 700 yuan. More than 800 photos were printed and developed, costing nearly 300 yuan. Two elaborate archways were built, costing a total of 465 workdays, with labor costs alone amounting to more than 650 yuan. More than 4,000 commemorative badges were also custom-made (at a cost of 45 cents each) and distributed to the comrades who attended the assembly. These badges were thick, large, and unattractive, and very few people wore them...
　　Because some leading staff and distinguished guests came to attend the assembly, the Mining Bureau entertained them lavishly. In addition to a grand banquet that cost more than 1,500 yuan, a reception with cigarettes, wine, candy, and tea was held, costing 470 yuan at once. In order to buy Spanish and Italian sausages, a special person was sent to Jinzhou and Harbin to purchase them; the travel and accommodation expenses of the purchaser far exceeded the value of these sausages.
　　This kind of waste has already directly affected the completion of the production cost plan to a certain extent. Through the efforts of the staff, the management expenses of the Mining Bureau in the first quarter were reduced in many items; however, the expenditure of the assembly’s costs caused the cost to exceed the budget by more than 4 percent, and the staff was very dissatisfied with this. Some comrades are infatuated with the bourgeois style of "showing off wealth" and "flaunting extravagance," believing that "for such a major event as the transfer of the vertical shaft to production, what does it matter to spend a few more dollars?" This has legitimized the waste.
　　The Shuangyashan Mining Bureau should review this mistake of extravagance and waste in order to recover the adverse effects caused thereby.

### 铺张浪费的庆祝大会

　　铺张浪费的庆祝大会编辑同志：
    今年二月十五日双鸭山矿务局为双鸭竖井煤矿移交生产举行了一次铺张浪费的庆祝大会，花掉人民币八千多元。
    庆祝会的很多开支都是不必要的。像布置会场和做红旗，就用了绸缎布料共一千四百五十尺，花了七百多元。照相共印洗了八百多张，花了近三百元。扎了两个很讲究的牌楼，共花了四百六十五个工，光人工费就是六百五十多元。还订做了四千多枚纪念章（每枚成本四角五分）发给参加大会的同志，这些纪念章又厚又大又不好看，很少有人佩带……。
    因为有一些领导工作人员和贵宾来参加大会，矿务局就大加招待。除了盛大的宴会花了一千五百多元以外，还举行一次备有烟、酒、糖、茶的招待会，一下就花了四百七十多元。为了买西班牙式和意大利式的肠子，还特地派专人到锦州和哈尔滨去采购；采购员的旅宿费就远远超过这些肠子的价值。
    这种浪费现象已经在一定程度上直接影响了生产成本计划的完成。矿务局第一季度的管理费，经过职工们的努力节约，有不少的项目都降低了；但是支出了这次大会的费用，却使成本超支了百分之四以上，职工们对此很不满意。有些同志迷恋于资产阶级“比阔气”“讲排场”的作风，认为“像竖井移交生产这样的大事，多花几个钱算啥”。这就使浪费现象合法化了。
    双鸭山矿务局应该检讨这种铺张浪费的错误，以挽回由此造成的不良影响。　　何升
