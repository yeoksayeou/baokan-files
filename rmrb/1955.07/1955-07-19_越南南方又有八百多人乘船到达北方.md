Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th: On July 15th, another 820 Vietnamese people seeking to return to the North arrived in Guohui, Nghe An Province, in the North, from the South on the French ship "Hope." They were welcomed and cared for by the local government and people upon landing.

The returnees revealed that they had been mistreated during the journey. Enemy soldiers robbed them of their property and even raped women on board.

The International Commission of Vietnam has sent a team to investigate these matters.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 16th, in the past month and a half, the French Union forces and the South Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly violated the Geneva Accords.

French armed personnel have illegally intruded into the demilitarized zone. According to residents of Gaoshe Village, Guangzhi Province, who reported to the Joint Ceasefire Team, on the evening of June 16, French police led about 15 people into Gaoshe Village. They arrested former resistance member Wu Ming and injured his wife and mother.

At the same time, newly arrived civilians from South Vietnam revealed that reprisals against former resistance personnel have been intensified in Guangzhi Province, Cheng-tian Province, and central South Vietnam. On the evening of June 8, the police in Shunhua kidnapped Nguyen Van Ap, a teacher at a civilian school, and then murdered him. Nguyen Van Ge, a civilian recently arrived from Guangnan Province, said that the Ngo Dinh Diem government arrested his father, Nguyen Van Hoa, along with two other former resistance members. A few days later, villagers found their bodies buried on the beach.

Northern residents who had been forcibly displaced and recently returned from the South have submitted hundreds of letters of complaint to the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee, accusing the South Vietnamese authorities of obstructing people from returning to the North. Du Thi Hua, a former resident of He-dong Province, said that due to the intervention of the International Commission, the Ngo Dinh Diem government had to allow some people to return to the North. However, even before the ship sailed, they still used every means to detain some people, thereby breaking up many families.

    越南南方又有八百多人乘船到达北方
    新华社河内十八日电　七月十五日，又有八百二十名要求北返的越南人民乘法国船“希望号”从南方到达北方义安省的果会。他们在上岸时，受到了当地政府和人民的欢迎和照顾。
    北返的人民透露他们在旅途中曾遭到虐待。对方的士兵抢劫了他们的财产，甚至还强奸了船上的妇女。
    越南国际委员会已派了一个小组对这些事进行调查。
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南通讯社十六日讯：在过去一个半月中，法兰西联邦部队和越南南方当局又多次违反了日内瓦协定。
    法方武装人员曾非法侵入非军事区。据广治省高舍村的居民向联合停战小组揭发，六月十六日晚，法方警察带领约十五人侵入高舍村。他们抓走了前抗战人员吴明，并且打伤了他的妻子和母亲。
    同时，新从越南南方来的平民揭发，在广治省、承天省和中越南部，对前抗战人员的报复行动已经加紧。六月八日晚上，顺化的警察架走了一个平民学校的教员阮文邑，随后杀害了他。新近从广南省来的平民阮文戈说，吴庭艳政府逮捕了他的父亲阮文和，同时被捕的有另外两名前抗战人员。几天以后，村民发现了他们的尸体被埋在沙滩上。
    不久前从南方回来的被强迫迁移的北方居民已经送交驻中央联合停战委员会的越南人民军代表团成百封控诉信，告发南越当局阻挠人们回北方。原河东省居民杜氏花说，由于国际委员会的干预，吴庭艳政府不得不让一些人回北方。但是，就在开船以前，他们仍然用一切方法扣留一些人，从而拆散许多家庭。
