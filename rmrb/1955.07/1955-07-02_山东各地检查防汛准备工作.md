　　Shandong Inspects Flood Prevention Preparations in Various Regions
　　The Shandong Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters dispatched four flood prevention work inspection teams on June 22nd and 23rd to conduct in-depth inspections of flood prevention preparations in various regions. Many special districts and counties have also begun inspecting and accelerating the construction of flood prevention projects. The Jiaozhou Special District Flood Prevention Headquarters assisted counties and districts along the Dagu River in conducting a comprehensive inspection of dangerous sections of the river embankment. The annual repairs in the Linyl Special District were completed earlier this year. In addition to the 32 water conservancy projects planned for construction, Junan and Mengyin counties alone have built 808 river embankment locations. The three work teams dispatched by the Special District Flood Prevention Headquarters have conducted a comprehensive inspection of water conservancy projects along the Yi, Shu, and Wu Rivers, and defenses have begun along the Yi and Shu Rivers.
　　This year's flood prevention task in Shandong Province requires ensuring that the Weiyun River, Yi River, Shu River, and 17 other major rivers and lake embankments do not breach, as well as ensuring that more than 13 million mu of farmland are not affected by floods and waterlogging.

　　山东各地检查防汛准备工作
    山东省防汛指挥部在六月二十二、三两日，派出了四个防汛工作检查组，深入各地检查防汛准备工作。许多专区、县也开始检查和加紧修建防汛工程，胶州专区防汛指挥部协助沿大沽河地区的县、区，对河堤险工进行了全面检查。临沂专区岁修工程今年都提早完成，除计划兴修的三十二项水利工程外，仅莒南、蒙阴两县就修筑河堤八百零八处。专区防汛指挥部派出的三个工作组，已对沂、沭、武河沿岸水利工程作了全面检查，沂、沭河并已开始设防。
    山东省今年防汛任务的要求，除保证卫运河、沂河、沭河等十七条较大河流和湖埝不决口外，还要保证一千三百余万亩农田不受洪涝灾害。
