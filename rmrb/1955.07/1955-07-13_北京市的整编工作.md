    Beijing's Streamlining Work
    Zhang Youyu
    The Central Committee has called on all state organs, institutions, and enterprises to thoroughly streamline their organizational structures and change the current unreasonable situation of large institutions, overlapping layers, uneven workload, and overstaffing. This can not only save the country a great deal of manpower and financial resources but is also one of the effective ways to overcome bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, improve the management of production departments, and increase labor productivity. The more thoroughly this work is carried out, the more beneficial it will be to our country's socialist construction. I think the Central Committee's call is completely correct and fully applicable to the situation in Beijing.
    Since the liberation of Beijing, due to the continuous development of construction, heavy tasks, and a lot of work, coupled with the rapid increase in population and the expansion of the area, institutions and personnel have inevitably increased somewhat. However, in reality, the increase in staffing has greatly exceeded the needs. Therefore, many unreasonable phenomena are also present here.
    In the past two years, under the instructions of the Central Committee, although we have carried out several streamlining efforts and reorganized administrative staffing, the results have been very poor. We have not earnestly implemented the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions and have not been responsible to the end for the streamlining work. After doing a little, we felt that the staffing was tight and could not be tightened any further. This is a manifestation of departmentalism. I was burdened by the so-called "strict control of administrative staffing," while some leading comrades of the units often complained about "too tight staffing." Under these circumstances, my implementation of the streamlining policy was weak, and thus the previous streamlining efforts all ended anticlimactically. In addition, in terms of approach, we did not truly rely on the masses to understand the situation. We were just haggling over numbers, so it was impossible to do this work well. Furthermore, we usually lacked strict supervision and control over the staffing of municipal enterprises and institutions, which had bigger and more numerous problems. When carrying out streamlining work, we adopted a laissez-faire attitude, only touching on it superficially and not seriously rectifying it at all.
    Based on the facts revealed by several units this time, we can more concretely understand that we still have very serious problems in terms of institutions and staffing.
      1.  Bloated institutions and overlapping layers. For example, the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China has sections under the divisions, and some divisions even have groups under them. Each division and section generally has "comprehensive personnel" to write materials and keep documents instead of the division and section chiefs. The Public Security Bureau has sections under the divisions, and the sections have groups. The group leaders form a level, called the "three-level system," but it is actually a "four-level system." Some large groups even have several subgroups. The General Office of the Public Health Bureau has five people doing general receiving and dispatching, with those in charge of receiving not responsible for dispatching, those in charge of sorting not responsible for registration, and those in charge of inspection and urging not responsible for filing, called "assembly line operation"! In fact, only about two hundred documents are received and dispatched every day. The Labor Bureau has many sections with detailed division of labor. When arranging work, they do not communicate with each other. Sometimes four sections notify the heads of the district labor sections to attend meetings at the same time; sometimes, staff members from several sections go to a district to understand the situation simultaneously. The staff members in the district reflect: This is a "grand meeting of cadres from the Labor Bureau."
    2.  Overstaffing, uneven workload, and low work efficiency. For example, the Supply Section of the Grain Bureau has sixty-four people. Some staff members can complete their formal work in only five or six days a month. The Finance and Accounting Section has fifty-four people, and some people can complete their work in only one or two hours a day. The external staff of each section run around aimlessly, solving few problems. The lower levels reflect: "Depart at nine, arrive at ten, chat and read the newspaper, take a nap after lunch, wander around the yard, and then run back." After the tallying (counting banknotes) work of the Cashier Section of the Xizhimen Office of the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China is completed, there is nothing to do. They ask the section chief, who says: "You can study the newspaper!" Everyone reads the newspaper once or twice. There is still an hour and a half before the end of the workday, so they ask the section chief again what to do. The section chief instructs: "Then you can chat!" So everyone chats until the end of the workday. The Supply Section of the Liulihe Cement Plant has eighteen people in charge of receiving and dispatching materials, of whom six people only receive and dispatch materials twenty times a month on average. The section receives and dispatches an average of three and a half documents a day, and there is also a dedicated receiver and dispatcher. Tongren Hospital has as many as eighteen messengers and another specially established "Chief Messenger," who actually has nothing to do. The Archives and Materials Section of the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee originally had twelve people, but in fact, six or seven people are enough.
    3.  Too many reports, complicated procedures, and serious red tape. For example, the Public Utilities Bureau requires its affiliated companies to submit fifty-three kinds of daily, weekly, ten-day, monthly, quarterly, and other reports. After preliminary inspection, thirty-eight kinds can be reduced and simplified. The labor time sheet issued by the Labor and Wage Section of the Construction Engineering Bureau has complicated items, and copying the numbers on each sheet alone takes more than two hours. After inspection, this kind of sheet is completely useless. In January and February of this year, each bureau director of the Real Estate Management Bureau received thirty-two kinds of internal documents from the bureau, totaling more than 122,000 words, not including daily official documents. When the Labor Bureau handled the Beijing Building Materials Industry Bureau's document on the dismissal of temporary workers, because the issue involved several sections, the document "traveled" between the office and the relevant sections, and everyone "discussed in writing" on the document. As a result, it entered and exited the office four times and took seventeen days to complete. Once, the Technical Section of the Waterworks Company received a letter requesting the repair of residential water pipes, which was passed around in the section for opinions and instructions. After forty-one days, it was finally processed. The opinions and instructions were more than ten times longer than the original letter! The red tape of the Municipal People's Committee itself is very serious. Recently, the processing of a document went through eleven procedures and took twenty-four days, without solving the problem.
    4.  The ratio of production personnel to non-production personnel is extremely unreasonable; there are too many people providing direct or indirect services. For example, the Yanjing Paper Mill has only two production workshops but eleven functional departments. At the Liulihe Cement Plant, non-production personnel (including Party, labor union, and Youth League personnel who have left production work, guards, cultural teachers, nursery staff, etc.) account for 24.3 percent; indirect production personnel (including technical management personnel, clerks, workshop workers, etc.) account for 20.7 percent; and direct production workers account for only 55 percent.
    5.  Administrative staffing is also seriously squeezing out the staffing of institutions and enterprises. The municipal-level institutions in the government system alone squeeze out the staffing of institutions and enterprises in seven units, totaling 158 people. In addition, some institutions and enterprises disregard staffing and add people at will.
    The kinds of facts listed above do not only occur in a few units but are relatively common phenomena. The units mentioned here are units that can discover problems themselves and are already or are in the process of solving them. There are still many units where the problems are serious, but they do not discover them or are unwilling to expose them. Of course, there is even less talk of solving them. This is called "concealing one's illness for fear of treatment," which is not glorious.
    Precisely because we still have very serious problems in terms of institutions and staffing, we must treat this streamlining work with a serious attitude and a fighting spirit, and implement the Central Committee's policy of "streamlining institutions, tightening staffing, reducing layers, and streamlining personnel." On March 12, the Municipal People's Committee established a staffing committee to uniformly lead and promote the city's streamlining work, which is carried out separately according to the Party and mass organizations, government, enterprises, and other systems. The basic approach is to combine leadership and the masses, with the top leader taking responsibility and personally taking action. First, from top to bottom, clarify the policy and get ideological understanding; second, mobilize the masses, check work, study business, and propose methods to improve leadership methods and improve work efficiency; finally, determine staffing according to actual needs. After this arrangement was made, the speed of progress in each unit was extremely uneven. Some units did it faster and better, such as the Finance Bureau, Taxation Bureau, Construction Engineering Bureau, Real Estate Management Bureau, and the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China in the government system. However, most units did it very slowly or very hastily, and some did not move at all. The reason is that we did not propose specific tasks, i.e., streamlining targets, as a goal to strive for, nor did we clearly explain the specific methods for handling transferred personnel. As a result, the leading staff members of these units were neither anxious nor afraid of trouble and were unwilling to carry out the work seriously, thinking that, like the previous streamlining efforts, it would pass after dragging it out for a while. In May, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, we proposed the specific tasks and methods of "cutting staffing in half" and "taking care of the personnel," which means that staffing must be greatly tightened, but not simply laying off people. The transferred personnel will be assigned to enrich other units that need people, especially grassroots units. The sick, old, and disabled will be handled separately. In factories and mines, we will implement increasing shifts and organizing rotating study to wait for state allocation. In administrative organs, we will study in batches and rotate work in three-month or six-month periods, so that they can be called upon at any time when the state needs them. Institutions will adopt the methods of factories and mines or administrative organs according to their nature. As a result, the situation immediately opened up. The vast majority of staff and workers expressed their support. With clear tasks and specific methods, coupled with the demands of the masses, the leading staff members of each unit also worked hard and quickly proposed streamlining plans for their units. These plans show that it is indeed possible to greatly tighten staffing, and the requirements put forward by the Central Committee are based on reality. For example, the Local Industry Bureau abolished its affiliated companies, divided them into four bureaus, and directly led the factories, which reduced staffing by 49 percent. Twenty-two units, including the Taxation Bureau, Grain Bureau, various Commercial Bureaus, Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China, reduced staffing by about 50 percent. Among them, the Third Commercial Bureau reached 64 percent, and the Grain Bureau reached 68 percent. The municipal-level government system averaged a 43 percent reduction in staffing across forty-two units. In addition, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Qinghe Woolen Mill can reduce approximately 25 percent of their total staffing. The number of people reduced by the factories and mines affiliated to the Building Materials Industry Bureau accounted for about 33 percent of the total staffing. These plans have been implemented after discussion by the masses and verification by the staffing committee. Following this, the streamlining work of the affiliated organs, district-level institutions, and general enterprises and institutions began.
    Streamlining institutions and tightening staffing is a very meticulous and complex task. The approach we initially adopted of clarifying the policy, mobilizing the masses, checking work, and studying business was correct and necessary. Some units did this, and not only did they not take a detour but also laid a solid foundation for completing the task later. Those who did not do this must make up this lesson. However, if we do not simultaneously propose specific tasks, i.e., streamlining targets, based on relatively reliable facts or circumstances, as a goal to strive for, then the so-called meticulous work will become synonymous with sitting still or moving forward slowly. Meticulous work and proposing tasks are both indispensable. This is one lesson. Another lesson is that the handling of surplus personnel in the previous streamlining efforts was not completely good. This made the leading staff members of each unit have concerns and lack confidence in this streamlining work. Therefore, the streamlining tasks and the handling methods of the transferred personnel must be proposed simultaneously. Another important lesson is that getting ideological understanding among the leading staff members at all levels is the main key to doing a good job in streamlining work. Staff members have generally realized that rather than staying in the original unit, having no work or very little work to do, and living a "four-not-like" life that is not like work, not like rest, not like study, and not like entertainment, they would rather study or wait for another job to be assigned. Anyway, the People's Government will reasonably arrange for the transferred personnel. They support the streamlining work. It is just that some leading staff members do not understand the business, are accustomed to the old working methods, and are always afraid of having too few people and too much work and not being able to complete the task. Therefore, they hold a skeptical and resistant attitude toward the streamlining work. As long as their thinking is straightened out, all problems will be solved easily. The final lesson is that the proposal and determination of the streamlining plan must be submitted to the masses for discussion before and after the event because it is the masses who truly understand the situation. Only after their discussion can the plan be practical and smoothly implemented.
    It must be emphasized that in the process of this streamlining work, our leading staff members at all levels have exposed various erroneous ideas. These erroneous ideas have become obstacles to the streamlining work. Now, generally speaking, these erroneous ideas have been corrected, but they have not been completely eliminated and must be continuously criticized.
    There is such a thought that streamlining work is just a routine, reducing a few people to perfunctorily get by. They do not understand that streamlining work is closely related to implementing the Party and the country's general line in the transition period and completing the cause of socialist construction. If we do not carry out the streamlining work seriously, it means that we are just using the general line as a slogan and do not want to implement it in practice; we do not truly support the cause of socialist construction but are undermining it.
    There is also such a thought that streamlining work is a task assigned by the superiors, and the extent to which it should be done is completely based on whether it can be accounted for to the superiors. Reduce as little as possible, and do not reduce if possible. If you have to reduce a lot, then reduce a lot. They do not work in a practical and realistic way but procrastinate, wait and see, feel out the superiors' bottom line, watch the wind, and wait for opportunities. They do not understand that this streamlining of institutions and tightening of staffing is not only to save manpower and financial resources but, more importantly, to improve work efficiency. Each unit should carry out this work seriously with a spirit of responsibility to the Party and the people under the general tasks proposed by the superiors, according to its own different tasks and problems in institutions and staffing.
    There is also such a thought that you can only simplify after you "refine." You must first improve the quality of staff members before you can reduce the number. They say that our staff members are of low quality, with "five mores and three less": more old and weak, more sick, more retained personnel, more people with political and historical problems, and more female cadres; fewer leading staff members, fewer Party and League members, and fewer activists. Therefore, it cannot be greatly reduced. They do not understand that tightening staffing and reducing personnel is a good way to improve the quality of cadres. If there are many people and little work, how can cadres improve their quality if they are smoking, drinking tea, and chatting all day long? If there are few people and a lot of work, you cannot complete the task if you do not work hard. In this way, you can gradually improve the quality of staff members from the practice of actual work. As for the so-called "five mores and three less," they are actually excuses. As far as the "five mores" are concerned: the old and weak can retire, and long-term sick leave has always been allowed not to occupy staffing, so they should not be problems. Retained staff members have generally improved after years of work and study, and some have joined the Party and League or become activists, so they cannot be regarded as burdens. As for people with major political problems in history, they are only individual cases and should be handled separately and cannot be confused with the streamlining problem. Only units with a particularly large number of female cadres should be given appropriate consideration in staffing due to their physiological reasons and more frequent leave. However, it is an incorrect manifestation of the patriarchal ideology to put forward "more female cadres" as a problem in general, and it should be criticized. As far as the "three less" are concerned: this is the general situation in our rapidly developing construction undertakings and is not a special phenomenon in any one unit. At the same time, in the past two years, we have accepted a considerable number of demobilized military cadres, many of whom are Party and League members, and many have become the backbone of work. However, some units have treated them as burdens, refusing to appoint them or discriminating against or excluding them after appointing them! In fact, in some units, there is another "more," that is, more people are hired privately, and some leading staff members even hire personal connections.
    Similar to this thought, some people believe that there are heavy tasks and a lot of work, and fewer people cannot handle it. If you do not reduce tasks, you cannot reduce staffing. They do not understand that improving leadership style, improving work efficiency, and overcoming bureaucracy, red tape, and pragmatism are effective ways to complete tasks and do a good job. It is a failing path to rely on too many people to solve problems when you are accustomed to the old ways. Facts have proved that some units do not have few people and many things but many people and few things. Therefore, they find some unnecessary things or things that are not within their business or responsibilities to do. The passive thought of "reduce as many people as you want! Anyway, do as much as you can with as many people as you have" is also wrong. Similarly, it is also wrong to try to replace the real streamlining of institutions and tightening of staffing by pushing tasks away. This is not actually reducing staffing but shifting the battlefield. You are not allowed to push out your own tasks casually. Of course, when handing over tasks that should be handed over, you must also hand over the staffing when handing over the tasks, which cannot be counted as reducing staffing.
    Others have asked questions: If you do not reserve some reserve forces and keep some mobile cadres, what will you do if tasks increase in the future or if there are temporary tasks, especially when cooperating with the city's central work? Our answer is: There is a solution, so there is no need to "worry about the sky falling." Cadres in study can be called upon if necessary, and the mobile quota in the total staffing can also supplement the shortage of staffing, so why "prepare but not use" and waste manpower?
    Some people have questioned: Studying in batches and rotating work do not reduce expenses. Isn't it just "changing the soup but not the medicine"? Why bother? Our answer is: Doing so can improve work efficiency, train and improve cadres, and is of great benefit to the country. You should not only focus on current expenses. Moreover, as the cause develops and people who are studying are assigned to new jobs in the future, the unit can still reduce expenses.
    The various erroneous ideas mentioned above are the main obstacles to the streamlining work and must be thoroughly criticized and corrected. Now, although the streamlining work of municipal administrative departments and large factories and mines is about to be successfully concluded, the streamlining work of affiliated organs, district-level institutions, and general enterprises and institutions has just begun. If these erroneous ideas are not completely eliminated, the streamlining work will be anticlimactic again!
    Streamlining work is an extremely important and extremely arduous task. It is difficult to complete the task without the leadership and support of Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of Party member cadres. All Party members in the city should mobilize and work together under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee in the spirit of being responsible to the Party and the people. I believe that we will definitely victoriously complete this glorious political task.

### 北京市的整编工作

    北京市的整编工作
    张友渔
    中央号召一切国家机关、事业机构、企业单位彻底整顿编制，改变目前的机构庞大、层次重叠、忙闲不均、人浮于事的不合理现象。这不仅可为国家大大节省人力、财力，而且是克服官僚主义、提高工作效率、改进生产部门的管理和提高劳动生产率的有效方法之一。这一工作进行得愈彻底，就愈有利于我国的社会主义建设事业。我认为中央这一号召是完全正确的，对于北京市的情况，也是完全适合的。
    北京市解放以来，由于建设事业不断发展，任务重、工作多、加以人口激增，区域扩大，机构和人员也就不能不增加一些，但就实际情况来看，增加的编制大大超过了需要，因而许多不合理现象，在我们这里是同样有的。
    两年来，在中央的指示下，我们虽曾进行过几次精简工作，整顿过行政编制，但做得很差。我们没有认真贯彻中央指示的精神，对整编工作不是负责到底，做一下之后，就又觉得编制紧了，不能再紧。这是一种本位主义在作祟。我就背着所谓“行政编制控制较严”的包袱，而有些单位的领导同志又常埋怨“编制太紧”，在这种情况下，我对贯彻精简的方针是不力的，于是过去几次的精简工作就都虎头蛇尾地结束了。加以在做法上，并没有真正去依靠群众，摸清情况，只是在数字上要价还价，当然不可能把这一工作做好。另外，我们对问题更大更多的市属企业单位和事业机构的编制，平常既缺乏严格的监督和控制；进行精简工作时，又采取了放任自流的态度，只是捎带一下，根本没有认真整顿。
    根据几个单位这次揭发出来的事实，可以较具体了解我们在机构上、编制上仍有很严重的问题。
      一、机构臃肿、层次重叠。例如人民银行北京分行，科下设股，股下有的还设组；各科、股一般都设有“综合人员”，代替科、股长写材料，保管文件。公安局处下有科，科内有组，组长形成一级，名为“三级制”，实际是“四级制”。有的大组下还设若干小组。公共卫生局办公室有五个人做总收发，管收的不管发，管分类的不管登记，管检催的不管归档，叫做“流水作业”！实际每天收发文不过二百件。劳动局设科多，分工细，布置工作，互不联系，有时四个科通知区劳动科长在同一时间开会；有时，几个科的工作人员同时去一个区了解情况，区里工作人员反映：这是“劳动局干部大会师”。
    二、人浮于事、忙闲不均、工作效率低。例如粮食局供应科六十四人，有的工作人员每月正式工作仅五、六天就可做完，财会科五十四人，有的人每天工作只一、二小时就可完成；各科外勤到下边乱跑，解决问题不多，下边反映：“九点出发，十点到，聊聊天，看看报，吃了午饭睡一觉，场内转转往回跑。”人民银行北京分行西直门办事处出纳股的整点（点票子）工作做完了，没事干，请示股长，股长说：“你们学习学习报纸吧！”大家把报纸看了一、两遍，离下班还有一小时半，又请示股长怎么办。股长指示：“那你们就聊聊吧！”于是大家就聊天到下班。琉璃河水泥厂供应科，管收发材料的有十八人，其中六人平均每月仅收发材料二十次；科内每天平均收发三件半文件，也设专职收发一人。同仁医院仅传达就有十八人，并另专设
  “传达长”一人，实际上没事干。市人民委员会办公厅档案资料科原有十二人，实际上有六、七人就够了。
    三、报表多、手续繁，文牍主义严重。例如公用局向所属公司要日、周、旬、月、季等报表五十三种，经初步检查，可削减和简化三十八种。建筑工程局劳动工资处制发的劳动时间表，项目繁琐，每份表仅抄数字就要两小时以上，经检查，这种表根本无用。房地产管理局今年一、二月份每个局长都收到本局内部文件三十二种，十二万二千多字，日常公文还不在内。劳动局处理北京市建筑材料工业局关于临时工人解雇问题来文时，因问题牵涉几个科，文件便在办公室和有关各科间“旅行”起来，大家都在文件上“笔谈”，结果，进出办公室四次，历时十七天才办完。自来水公司技术股有一次接到一份要求修理住宅水管的来信，在科内转来转去，签署意见和批示，经过四十一天，才得到处理。签署和批示比原信的文字，多十倍多！市人民委员会本身文牍主义就很严重，最近处理一件公文曾经过十一道手续，历时二十四天，并没有解决问题。
    四、生产人员和非生产人员比例极不合理；直接或间接服务的人员过多。例如燕京造纸厂只有两个生产车间，却设有十一个职能科室。琉璃河水泥厂，非生产人员（包括党、工会、青年团脱离生产的工作人员、警卫人员、文化教员、保育员等）占百分之二十四点三；间接生产人员（包括技术管理人员、职员、车间勤杂人员等）占百分之二十点七；直接生产的工人仅占百分之五十五。
    五、行政编制挤占事业、企业编制也很严重。仅政府系统市级机构挤占事业、企业编制的就有七个单位，共一百五十八人。此外，有些事业、企业单位更是不顾编制，随便加人。
    像上面列举的这类事实，决不是只发生在少数单位，而是比较普遍的现象。在这里提出的几个单位是能够自己发现问题，并已经或正在解决问题的单位。还有不少单位，问题是严重的，但自己不去发现或不愿揭发，当然，更谈不到解决问题了。这叫做“讳疾忌医”，并不光荣。
    正由于我们在机构上、编制上，仍有很严重的问题，所以我们必须以严肃的态度、战斗的精神，对待这次的整编工作，贯彻中央“整顿机构，紧缩编制，减少层次，精简人员”的方针。市人民委员会于三月十二日成立了编制委员会统一领导和推动全市整编工作，下面按照党群、政府、企业等系统，分别进行。基本做法是领导和群众相结合，首长负责，亲自动手。首先，自上而下，阐明方针，搞通思想；其次，发动群众，检查工作，研究业务，提出改进领导方法和提高工作效率的办法，最后，根据实际需要，确定编制。这样布置下去后，各单位进行的速度，极不平衡。有的单位做得较快，较好，例如政府系统的财政局、税务局、建筑工程局、房地产管理局、人民银行北京分行等。但多数单位做得很慢或很草率，有的根本没有动。原因是由于我们没有提出作为奋斗目标的具体任务即整编的指标，也没有交代清楚处理抽调人员的具体办法，以致这些单位的领导工作人员既不着急，又怕麻烦，不肯认真进行，以为像前几次整编一样，拖一拖就过去了。五月间，我们根据市委指示提出了“编制砍一半”、“人员包下来”的具体任务和办法，就是说：编制必须大大紧缩，但并不是单纯裁员。被抽调的人员除一部分将被分配去充实其他需人单位特别是基层单位，病老残废等将另行处理外，在厂矿企业，将实行增加班次，组织轮班学习，以等候国家调配的办法；在行政机关，则以三个月或半年为一期，分批学习，轮流工作，一旦国家需要，就可随时调用。事业单位则按照性质分别采用厂矿企业或行政机关的办法。这样一来，局面立刻打开。广大工作人员和职工普遍表示拥护。各单位领导工作人员由于任务明确，办法具体，再加上群众要求，也都起劲去做，很快就提出了本单位的整编方案。整编工作有了飞跃的开展。这些方案表现出：大大紧缩编制，确有可能，中央提出的要求是有根据的。例如地方工业局撤销了所属各公司，分为四个局，直接领导工厂，就减少编制百分之四十九。税务局、粮食局、各商业局、建筑工程局、人民银行北京分行等二十二个单位都减少编制百分之五十左右，其中，第三商业局达到百分之六十四，粮食局达到百分之六十八。市级政府系统四十二个单位平均减少编制百分之四十三。此外，石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂和清河制呢厂三个单位共可减少约占总编制百分之二十五的职工。建筑材料工业局所属各厂矿减少的人数约占总编制的百分之三十三左右。这些方案经过群众讨论，编制委员会核定，已付诸实施。接着并开始了各附属机关，区级机构和一般事业、企业单位的整编工作。
    整顿机构、紧缩编制是一项很细致，很复杂的工作。我们最初所采取的阐明方针发动群众检查工作研究业务等做法，应该说是正确的，必要的。有些单位这样做了，不但不是走了弯路，而且是给后来完成任务打下可靠的基础。没有这样做的，还必须补这一课。但是如果不同时提出以比较可靠的事实或情况为根据的具体任务即紧缩的指标，作为奋斗目标，那所谓细致的工作便会成为坐着不动，或慢步前进的同义语。细致工作和提出任务二者不可偏废。这是一条经验。另一条经验是过去几次整编对编余人员的处理做得不完全好。这就使得各单位领导工作人员对这次整编工作有顾虑，信心差。因此，整编任务和被抽调人员的处理办法必须同时提出。还有一条重要经验，就是打通各级领导工作人员的思想是做好整编工作的主要关键。工作人员一般都已认识到：与其呆在原单位，没有工作或很少工作做，过着一不像工作，二不像休息，三不像学习，四不像娱乐的“四不像”生活，宁肯去学习或听候另行分配工作，反正人民政府对抽调出的人员是会合理安排的。他们是拥护整编工作的。只是有些领导工作人员对业务不摸底，习惯于老一套的工作方法，老害怕人少事多，完成不了任务，因此，对整编工作抱着怀疑、抗拒的态度。只要他们的思想打通，一切问题就迎刃而解了。最后一条经验是，整编方案的提出和确定，必须在事先和事后，交付群众讨论，因为真正了解情况的是群众，经过他们讨论，才能使方案切合实际，顺利执行。
    必须着重指出：在这次整编工作进行的过程中，我们的各级领导工作人员曾经暴露出各种错误思想。这些错误思想，曾经成为整编工作的障碍。现在，一般地说，这些错误思想是得到纠正了，但并不是已经彻底肃清，还必须不断地继续批判。
    有这样一种思想：整编工作不过是例行公事，多少减几个人，敷衍过去就是了。他们不了解：整编工作同贯彻党和国家在过渡时期的总路线，完成社会主义建设事业，有重要关系。如果我们不认真进行整编工作，那就说明我们只是把总路线做为口头禅，并不想在实践中贯彻它；我们并不是真正拥护社会主义建设事业，而是破坏它。
    也有这样一种思想：整编工作是上级交下来的任务，应该做到什么程度，完全以能否向上级交差为标准，能少减就少减，能不减就不减，必须多减只好多减。他们不是实事求是，进行工作，而是磨磨蹭蹭、观望不前，摸上级的底，看风使舵，待机行事。他们不了解：这次整编机构、紧缩编制不仅是为了节省人力、财力，更重要的是为了提高工作效率。各单位应该在上级提出的总的任务下，根据自己不同的任务和机构上、编制上的问题，以对党、对人民负责的精神，认真地进行这一工作。
    还有这样一种思想：“精”而后能简。必须先提高工作人员质量，才能减少数量。他们说我们的工作人员质量低，“五多，三少”：老弱多、病号多、留用人员多、有政治和历史问题的多、妇女干部多；领导工作人员少、党团员少、积极分子少。因此，不能大减。他们不了解：紧缩编制、减少人员，正是提高干部质量的好方法。人多事少，干部整天抽烟、喝茶、聊闲天，怎能提高质量？人少事多、不努力就不能完成任务。这样，就可以从实际工作的锻炼中，逐步提高工作人员的质量。至于所谓“五多，三少”，其实都是一些借口。就“五多”来说：老弱可以退休、退职，长期病号原来就允许不占编制，都不应成为问题。留用工作人员经过几年来的工作、学习，一般已有所提高，有的并参加了党、团或成为积极分子，不能一概当做包袱。至于历史上有较大政治问题的人，只是个别的，应另行处理，不能和整编问题混为一谈。只有妇女干部特别多的单位，由于她们生理上的关系，给假较多，还有一小部分能力较弱，在编制上当给予适当照顾。但笼统地把“妇女干部多”当做问题提出，是重男轻女的不正确思想的表现，应该受到批评。就
  “三少”来说：这是我们建设事业迅速发展中的一般情况，并不是那一个单位的特殊现象。同时，两年来，我们曾接受了相当数量的军队转业干部，他们当中党团员很多，不少的人并已成为工作中的骨干，但是有些单位却把他们当做包袱，拒绝任用，或在任用后，加以歧视或排斥！实际上，在有些单位，另有“一多”，那就是私自招用人员多，甚至有些领导工作人员引用私人。
    和这种思想相类似，有人认为：任务重、工作多，人少不顶事，不减少任务，就不能减少编制。他们不了解：改进领导作风，提高工作效率，克服了官僚主义、文牍主义、事务主义，才是完成任务做好工作的有效办法；习惯于老一套，靠过多的人解决问题是失败的道路。事实证明：有的单位不是人少事多而是人多事少，因此，才在那里找一些不必要的或不属于自己业务或职责范围以内的事做。那种“减多少人，随你的便吧！反正有多少人办多少事”的消极思想也是错误的。同样，想用推任务的方法来代替真正的精简机构紧缩编制，也是错误的。这实际上不是减少编制，而是转移了阵地。自己的任务不允许随便推出去；应该交出去的任务，在交任务时，当然要连编制交出去，不能算做减少编制。
    还有人说：我们的编制本来就很紧了，不能减，再减也“油水”不大，特别是行政编制“油水”不大，要减就减企业和事业编制，抠行政编制是抛掉西瓜，只拣芝麻。我们认为应该实事求是地对待问题，如果确实编制很紧，根据实际情况，可以少减，或不减。但从许多单位揭发出的问题来看，目前，我们编制上主要的和普遍的问题不是紧，而是松，很松。企业、事业编制要减，行政编制也要减。西瓜不应抛掉，芝麻也要拣起。芝麻多了，也就等于西瓜。市级政府系统四十二个单位计划抽调出来的工作人员仅比石景山钢铁厂等三个大厂抽调的少五百来人。而且企业、事业单位应减的人数固然多，但行政单位应减的人数在本单位的总编制中所占百分比则较大，这说明行政单位的编制更不合理。
    另外，有人提出疑问：不储备一些后备力量，保存一些机动干部，将来任务增加或有临时任务，特别是配合全市的中心工作时怎么办？我们的答复是：自有解决办法，不必“杞人忧天”。学习中的干部，如确有必要，可以调用，总编制中的机动名额也可补充编制的不足，何必“备而不用”，浪费人力呢？
    有人提出疑问：分批学习，轮流工作，并没有减少开支，岂不是“换汤不换药”？何必多此一举？我们的答复是：这样做可以提高工作效率，培养和提高干部，对国家有很大好处，不应只着眼在目前的开支上。并且学习的人员将来随着事业的发展，分配给新的工作后，本单位还是可以减少开支的。
    上面说到的各种错误思想是整编工作的主要障碍，必须给予彻底的批判和纠正。现在，市级行政部门和大的厂矿企业的整编工作虽将胜利结束，但附属机关、区级机构和一般企业、事业单位的整编工作还刚刚开始，如果不把这些错误思想彻底肃清，整编工作又会是虎头蛇尾！
    整编工作是一个极其重要又极其艰巨的工作，没有各级党组织和广大党员干部的领导和支持是很难完成任务的。全市党员动员起来，在党中央和市委的领导下，本着对党对人民负责的精神，共同努力做好这一工作。我相信，我们一定会胜利地完成这一光荣的政治任务。
