Anshan Iron and Steel Exceeds Semiannual Quota for Fourteen Major Products
　　More Than Forty Projects Completed Before the End of June
　　
Anshan, July 7 (By our correspondent) Twenty-eight major production plants and mines of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have completed the state plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. Fourteen of the sixteen major products have exceeded the state plan for the first half of the year. Among them, thirteen products, including pig iron, steel ingot, and medium plate, exceeded the production level of the first half of 1954. The product quality has also been improved month by month, and medium plate, welded steel pipe, and seamless steel pipe have all exceeded the quality plan for the first half of the year.

By the end of May, Anshan Iron and Steel Company had completed 77.78 percent of the annual production increase plan, and the cost was reduced by 13.25 percent compared with the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 7th. By the end of June, more than forty projects of Anshan Iron and Steel had been completed. In the first half of this year, the amount of construction and installation work completed by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company was twice that of the same period in 1954.

Many workshops and coke ovens were quickly put into production after completion. After the No. 13 and No. 14 coke ovens were put into production on March 7, the coke produced by Anshan Iron and Steel not only fully met the needs of ironmaking, but also supplied some to many smelting and machinery manufacturing plants across the country. The second recovery workshop, which was put into production on March 8, has produced enough ammonium sulfate fertilizer in more than three months to be used for more than 200,000 mu of cotton fields. The No. 2 open hearth furnace, which was put into production on May 29, has shortened the average steelmaking time per furnace in June by more than three hours compared with before the renovation.

Some projects will be put into full or partial production in July. The fourth automated ironmaking furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, which was severely damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries and shut down for ten years, will be put into production in a few days. The renovated second concentration plant and second sintering plant of Anshan Mining Plant will also start producing artificial rich ore in the next few days.

Many important projects that will be put into production after August this year and next year have also mostly completed the state's schedule. In the Chemical General Plant, the new factory buildings of the renovated washing workshop, carbolic acid pyridine workshop, and crystallization workshop have been completed, and mechanical installation workers are busy installing mechanical equipment. The foundation pouring work of the newly built mechanized coal storage yard has been basically completed, and the installation of the giant "gantry crane" has begun.

　　鞍钢十四种主要产品超额完成上半年计划
　  四十多项工程在六月底以前建设完工
    本报鞍山七日电　鞍山钢铁公司有二十八个主要生产厂矿提前完成了上半年的国家计划，十六种主要产品中有十四种超额完成了上半年国家计划。其中生铁、钢锭、中板等十三种产品超过了一九五四年上半年的生产水平。产品质量也逐月提高，中板、焊接钢管、无缝钢管等都超过了上半年的质量计划。
    到五月底，鞍山钢铁公司已经完成全年增产计划的百分之七十七点七八，成本比计划降低百分之十三点二五。
    新华社鞍山七日电　到六月底，鞍钢已有四十多项工程建设完工。今年上半年，鞍山钢铁建设公司职工完成的建筑安装工作量比一九五四年同期大一倍。
    许多车间和炼焦炉等完工以后，迅速投入了生产。十三、十四号炼焦炉在三月七日投入生产以后，鞍钢生产的焦炭除充分满足了炼铁需要以外，还有一部分供给全国各地许多冶炼、机械制造厂使用。三月八日投入生产的第二回收车间，三个多月来生产的肥田粉硫氨就可供二十多万亩棉田使用。五月二十九日才投入生产的二号平炉，在六月份里平均每炼一炉钢的时间比改建前缩短了三小时多。
    还有一些工程将在七月份全部或部分投入生产。曾遭受国民党反动派严重破坏、停产了十年的鞍钢第四座自动化炼铁炉，再过几天就要投入生产了。改建的鞍山选矿厂第二选矿场、第二烧结场也要在最近几天内开始生产人造富矿。
    将在今年八月以后和明年投入生产的许多重要工程，也大都完成了国家的进度。在化工总厂，改建的洗涤车间、石炭酸砒碇车间和结晶车间的新厂房已经建成，机械安装工人正在忙着安装机械设备。新建的机械化贮煤场的基础浇灌工作已经基本结束，巨型“门型吊车”的安装工作已经开始。
