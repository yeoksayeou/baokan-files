Taking the Mine as Home
By Our Correspondent Lù Hào

    "Miners send the sun from underground to the surface.
    Coal—that is the sun of mankind: it shines, it heats, it provides power..."
    —Gorbatov: Donbass

    The lights are bright in the club of the Fushun Victory Coal Mine, where a joyous dance party for the miners is being held. The mine's own band is enthusiastically playing moving dance tunes over and over.

    Tonight, the dance partner that Mine Director Zhang invited is Wang Maoxian, a sixty-one-year-old shotfirer. Wang Maoxian's mustache is stiff as if standing upright, and bristles all over his chin. His gaunt face is covered in smiles, as if smoothing out all the wrinkles.
    "I'm just here to watch. How could I dance?" he said awkwardly when Mine Director Zhang invited him to dance.
    "It doesn't matter," the mine director said. "Let's just bounce around! As long as we don't step on each other's feet."
    He gladly stood up, and joined the lively crowd hand-in-hand with the mine director.

    Although Wang Maoxian was enthusiastic, things like dancing were still too unfamiliar to him. In his opinion, this dancing was much more strenuous than setting off explosives in the "working face." Before long, he was drenched in sweat.
    "Old Wang," Mine Director Zhang looked at the gray-haired old miner during a break, and brought up an old matter again: "No matter what, you should retire."
    This matter was called an old one because it had already come up since Wang Maoxian turned sixty.

    It started when the chairman of the Third Mining Team's trade union talked to him: "Uncle Wang (everyone at the mine respectfully called him that), people of your age don't need to go down the well anymore."
    "Is this an order from the mine?"
    "No, it's a national regulation. Workers who are sixty years old can retire and enjoy their old age."
    "If it's a national order, I'll obey it without another word," Wang Maoxian said. "If it's voluntary, that's another story."
    "At your age, you should retire."
    "Are you saying I can't do it anymore?" Wang Maoxian asked him unconvinced. "At the 'working face,' how am I any worse than the young people?"
    This point left the trade union chairman speechless. Indeed, he was no worse than the young people. Some people had to find another person to help them carry forty or so explosives down the well; he always packed fifty or so explosives in one bag, weighing seventy or so pounds, and he was never seen asking for help. Some people rested for a while after setting off explosives, but he would either help people push carts or tidy up the pit props beside the railway.

    In order to get Wang Maoxian to retire, the captain, branch secretary, and trade union chairman of the Third Mining Team all talked to Wang Maoxian, but they were all rebuffed. Having no other choice, everyone asked Wang Maoxian's third son, Wang Zhaogui, for help. Wang Zhaogui was then the deputy secretary of the Third Mining Team's Party branch.
    "We can't convince him, now it's up to you." Everyone placed their hopes on Wang Zhaogui.
    "I can't guarantee anything!" Wang Zhaogui said, seemingly without confidence.
    "This is a task assigned to you by everyone, you can't fail to complete it." Everyone exhorted him like this when Wang Zhaogui left the office.

    Wang Zhaogui returned home and said to his father: "Everyone told me to persuade you to retire."
    "Don't talk to me about that, I know."
    "Dad, people are saying you're old, saying you should retire."
    How could Wang Maoxian admit that he was old? People at the mine still remembered when he joined the Chinese Communist Party at the advanced age of fifty-nine.

    That was a couple of years ago. He had wanted to join the Party for a long, long time, yearning to become a communist fighter and do more work for the Party. However, he felt that he was already so old, and he wasn't sure if the Party would still want him at such an age, so he never dared to mention it. One day, he went to see Li Yuting, who was in the same group as him. Li Yuting was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.
    "I'm asking you for a favor," Wang Maoxian said.
    "What is it?"
    "I'm so old, I want to join the Party, does the Party still want me?"
    "Joining the Party mainly depends on your loyalty and dedication to communism, old age doesn't matter."
    Wang Maoxian was extremely happy to hear this. He couldn't write himself, so he asked Li Yuting to help him write a note to the branch secretary applying to join the Party.
    The note that Wang Maoxian gave to the branch secretary read: "Wang Maoxian requests to join the Party, please review."

    At the Party branch meeting, everyone unanimously approved Wang Maoxian's application to join the Party. Everyone was very clear about everything about him, this old miner who had lived in the mine for forty-five years.

    That day, as he walked from the Victory Mine's West Shaft back to his dormitory in Victory New Village, his excitement was indescribable. He looked at the sparse trees on the west side of the road that had looked like small sticks when he was young, and now they were lush with foliage. The grayish-blue piles of gangue around the mine, like continuous mountain ranges, stretched far into the distance. The tall, dark mine headframe, proudly illuminated by golden sunlight, stood erect. Comfortable green trams carried the workers happily through the city. These scenes truly filled his heart with mixed feelings, and past events surged into his mind like a tide.

    In those long, painful days, the mine was like a slaughterhouse, and people were confined to suffering inside barbed wire. "Four pieces of rock and one piece of meat," after going down the well today, you didn't know if you could come up tomorrow. Although the miners dug up thousands and thousands of tons of coal every day, they felt like they were living in an ice cellar in the twelfth lunar month, and could only cover themselves with a tattered sack. People's only hope was to find a way to leave this hell on earth. At that time, many people secretly left the mine. Wang Maoxian had a large family, and there was nowhere for him to go even if he wanted to, so he had to do his best to help others leave this painful place. He remembered that one year on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, he pretended to be going to visit graves, took some paper money for burning, led two young men from other places who had been captured by the Japanese invaders, passed through the sorghum fields, and sent them to the train station. Because he was worried, he simply got on the train himself, and accompanied them all the way to Shenyang. In Shenyang, he bought them train tickets, and only returned after watching them board the train safely.

    After liberation, Wang Maoxian liked to drink a little wine with every meal. He had a radio on his kang (heated brick bed), and he lived a carefree life. His three sons, one became a soldier in the People's Liberation Army; one worked in the lamp room of the Victory Mine; and the third son, Wang Zhaogui, had now become a driver of a combined coal mining machine. The new society gave Wang Maoxian a happy old age. He loved the mine and treated it as his home. He loved his coal mining career. For more than five years, Wang Maoxian had never been absent from work once, and not even a single case of being late or leaving early had occurred. He had become the most respected old man in the mine.

    There was a period in the mine when absenteeism was very serious. At the worst, the attendance rate only reached eighty-some percent. Some people thought that after liberation, going to work or not was up to them, and they often worked one day and rested for three. After getting paid, they had some money in their pockets, and they weren't content until they had spent it all. A young miner named Wang Chunsheng was also "fishing for three days and drying nets for two." If he encountered even a minor thing, he would stop working.

    Wang Maoxian once asked Wang Chunsheng: "Why are you always absent from work?"
    "I often fall asleep without meaning to, and I can't help it," Wang Chunsheng said embarrassedly.
    "That's mainly because you're not firm in your heart," Wang Maoxian said. "If you're not determined in your heart, and you think it's okay to miss work, then you're sure to be absent; but if you feel that you absolutely can't be absent from work, then you definitely won't be able to rest."

    To illustrate his point, Wang Maoxian also told him a story of his own.

    Once, it was Wang Maoxian's turn to work the third shift (i.e., starting work at eleven o'clock at night). That day, he was very sleepy. In order to prevent himself from oversleeping, he specifically told his wife before going to bed to wake him up when the time came. Usually, whether Wang Maoxian worked the day shift or the night shift, his wife would either wait for him to go to work or wait for him to come back to rest, but on this day, his wife also fell asleep. Wang Maoxian woke up to find that there was only a little more than half an hour left before work. He didn't even bother to eat, and went straight to the tram station, but the tram had just left. Braving the wind and snow, he ran all the way to the mine entrance, and there were still five minutes left before work. People were just preparing to take the cage down the well.

    Wang Chunsheng was very touched by the old man's words. From then on, he no longer skipped work. In the past, Wang Chunsheng felt that it was a very good deal to use working time to do some of his own things; now he turned over a new leaf, and he tried his best not to encroach on working time. Not long ago, Wang Chunsheng got married, and his family needed to build a kang. In the past, he would definitely have felt justified in taking a few days off, but this time, he used his Sunday off to build the kang. He didn't finish it in one day, so he continued to work late into the night, and went to work as usual the next day. Many people at the mine said: "As long as you look at Grandpa Wang, you'll know how you should work."

    Of course, there were still things in Wang Maoxian's home that needed him. In the New Year of 1952, his third son, Zhaogui, got married. Marriage was a big event for a miner's family. In the old society, "a coal miner stinks for fifty li even against the wind," and almost no girl was willing to marry a miner as a wife. Today, his own son was getting married, and the old man's joy was indescribable. However, when relatives and friends had all arrived, Wang Maoxian had to take his leave to attend the opening ceremony of their mine's cultural studies.
    "Today is a big day for your family, why are you leaving?" the guests said.
    "We're all family, you can take care of things for me!" He said contentedly with boundless joy: "It's the opening ceremony, how can I not go?"

    No one in the family could dissuade him, and he didn't return until after twelve noon.

    Think about it, wouldn't it be too sad for someone like Wang Maoxian to retire. "You're saying that too," Wang Maoxian felt that even his own son didn't understand him when Wang Zhaogui told him that everyone wanted him to retire. He was almost angry when he said: "How can you use these words to trap me? If I'm already a piece of rotten wood, then I must let it burn well, not let it just smoke without a flame."

    Wang Zhaogui had no choice but to report back directly. Everyone also felt that they couldn't be too insistent on the old man's good intentions. The result of the discussion was to let Wang Maoxian look after the explosives warehouse underground in the future, and not go to the "working face" to set off explosives anymore.

    When Wang Maoxian heard that he was going to look after the warehouse, he said: "I'm old, my eyes are bad, what if I lose the explosives?" He also said: "This one takes how many, that one takes how many, what if I can't figure out the accounts?" Anyway, he didn't want to look after the warehouse. Finally, he said almost pleadingly: "At the 'working face,' I can wander around, I really can't sit still looking after the warehouse." He said it so sincerely that anyone who heard it would sympathize with him.

    The Third Mining Team's team headquarters finally made a decision that took into account his age and his wishes. The decision was to let Wang Maoxian set off explosives at the "roadway intersection" instead of working at the "working face."

    Now, Wang Maoxian is setting off explosives at the "roadway intersection." At the dance party, Mine Director Zhang asked about this old matter again, and Wang Maoxian seemed a little embarrassed when he said: "I grew up in the mine. For decades, my heart has been used to being underground, I can't do it staying above." He replied with a smile, his voice was very low, but his tone was very firm. He felt that no matter how he said it, it was still the same old opinion.

    Another moving piece of music began to play. This time, it wasn't someone else inviting him to dance, but a large group of young people surrounded him, asking him to talk about how the miners of the past had lived.

### 以矿为家

    以矿为家
    本报记者　陆灏
    矿工把地下的太阳送到地上。
    煤——这就是人类的太阳：它发光，发热，供给能力……
    ——戈尔巴托夫：顿巴斯
    抚顺胜利煤矿的俱乐部里灯光明亮，一个欢乐的矿工们参加的舞会在这里举行。矿山上自己组成的乐队热情地一遍又一遍地演奏动人的舞曲。
      今天晚上，张矿长邀请的舞伴是六十一岁的放炮工王茂先。王茂先嘴上的胡子，硬得像竖起来一样，毛拉拉地长满了整个下巴，在他瘦削的脸庞上满堆着笑容，好像把他脸上的皱纹都舒平了。
    “我是来看看的。我哪里能跳这个？”当张矿长邀请他跳舞的时候，他很不自然地说。
    “不要紧。”矿长说：“咱们瞎蹦跶呗！踩不着脚就行。”
    他欣然地站了起来，和矿长手拉手地加入了这个欢跃的人群。
      王茂先虽然兴致勃勃，但类似跳舞这一类事情对于他毕竟还是太生疏了。在他看来，这跳舞，比他在“掌子”里放炮可吃力得多呢。不大一会，他身上就大汗淋漓了。
    “老王，”在休息的时候，张矿长看着这位须发斑白的老矿工，又问起一件旧事情来：“无论怎么说，你还是应该退休了。”
    把这件事情说成是件旧事情，这是因为自从王茂先六十岁以后，这件事情就已经发生了。
    开始是第三采煤队的工会主席同他谈话：“王大爷（矿上的人大家都这样尊敬地称呼他），上了年纪的人不必再下井了。”
    “是矿上的命令吗？”
    “不是，这是国家的规定。满六十岁的工人，可以退休养老了。”
    “要是国家的命令，我服从，没有别的说的。”王茂先说：“要是自愿，这就好说。”
    “像你老这样大岁数，应该退休了。”
    “你是说我不能干了吗？”王茂先不服气地问他：“我在‘掌子’里，哪一点比青年人差？”
    这一点，使得工会主席哑口无言。的确是这样，他一点也不比年轻人差，有的人背四十来个炮，下井的时候，就另外要找一个背炮的人；他一兜总装五十来个炮，有七十来斤重，从没见他找人帮过忙。有的人放完炮，就歇着坐一会儿，他呢，不是去帮人推车，就是去整理铁道旁的坑木去了。
    为了让王茂先退休，第三采煤队的队长、支部书记、工会主席都同王茂先谈过话，但都给碰回来了。大家没有办法，就请王茂先的三儿子王兆贵来帮忙。王兆贵那时候是第三采煤队的党支部的副书记。
    “我们谁也说服不了，现在要看你的了。”大家都把希望放在王兆贵的身上。
    “我可没有保证啊！”王兆贵显得毫无把握地说。
    “这是大伙儿交给你的任务，不完成可不行。”王兆贵在离开办公室的时候，大家还这样叮咛他说。
    王兆贵回到家里，他对父亲说：“大伙儿都对我说，要我劝你退休。”
    “别给我说这个，我知道。”
    “爹，人家都说你老了，说你应该退休了。”
    王茂先怎么能承认自己老呢。矿山上的人都还记得他以五十九岁的高龄加入中国共产党的情形。
    那是前两年的事情了。他想参加党，已经想了很久很久，他渴望着成为共产主义的一个战士，为党做更多的工作。但是，他觉得自己的年纪已经这样大了，这样大的年纪，党是不是还需要他，他一直不敢提。有一天，他去找同组的李玉亭。李玉亭是中国共产党的党员。
    “我求你一件事。”王茂先说。
    “什么事？”
    “我这样大年岁了，我想入党，党还要我不？”
    “入党主要是看你对共产主义献身的忠心，年纪老了，这并不重要。”
    王茂先听了高兴极了。他自己不会写字，要求李玉亭帮他给支部书记写张申请入党的纸条。
    王茂先给支部书记的纸条上写着：“王茂先要求入党，请审查。”
    在党支部的会议上，大家一致同意了王茂先的入党申请。对于他，这位在矿山上生活了四十五年的老矿工的一切根底，大家都是非常清楚的。
    那一天，他从胜利矿的西井走回他的宿舍胜利新村去，他的兴奋的心情是难以形容的。他看看路西边在幼年时候像小棍儿的稀稀拉拉的树木，现在已经枝叶成荫了。矿井周围的青灰色的矸石堆，像连绵不断的山岭似地一直伸展到远方。那黑黝黝的高高的被一片金色的阳光照耀着的井架子傲然地矗立着。绿色的舒适的电车载着工人们快乐地穿过市区。这些景象，真使他的心头百感交集，往日的旧事，像潮水般地向他的脑中涌来。
    在那些漫长的痛苦的日子里，矿山像杀人场一样，人们被圈在铁丝网里受苦。“四块石头夹一块肉”，今天下了井，不知道明天能不能上来。矿工们虽然每天挖出上千上万吨煤炭，但他们自己在腊月里却像住在冰窖里，身上只能盖一块烂麻袋。人们唯一的希望是怎样才能够离开这个人间的地狱。那时候，很多人都偷偷地离开矿山，王茂先因为一家人口多，想走，也没有地方走，于是他只好尽力帮助别人离开这个痛苦的地方。记得有一年的夏历七月十五，他假装上坟，带了点烧纸，领着两个被日本侵略者抓来的外乡的年轻人，穿过高粱地，送他们上了车站。因为自己不放心，他又干脆自己也上了车，一直陪他们到了沈阳，在沈阳，他给他们买好车票，眼看他们平安地上了火车，他才放心回来。
    解放以后的王茂先，每顿饭喜欢喝一点酒，他的炕头上摆着无线电收音机，他过的是无忧无愁的日子。他的三个儿子，一个成了解放军的战士；一个在胜利矿矿灯房工作；第三个儿子王兆贵，现在已经成了联合采煤机的司机。新社会使王茂先有了欢乐的晚年。他热爱矿山，把矿山当成自己的家，他热爱自己的采煤事业，五年多以来，王茂先从来没有旷过一次工，甚至连迟到和早退也没有发生过，他成为矿山上最受尊敬的一位老人。
    矿山上曾经有过一个时期旷工的现象很严重，最糟糕的时候，出勤率只达到百分之八十几。有些人以为解放了，上班不上班要随自己的便，往往上一天工歇三天，领了工资，口袋里有了几个钱，不用完，不甘心。有个年轻的矿工叫王春生，也是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，碰上个小小不点儿的事，就歇工不干了。
    王茂先有一次问王春生：“你怎么老旷工？”
    “我常常不由自己就睡过头了，我自己也没有办法啊。”王春生难为情地说。
    “那主要还是你心里含糊。”王茂先说：“你如果心里不坚决，觉得不能上班，误就误了吧，那就准旷工；但如果自己觉得无论如何不能旷工，那就一定歇不了。”
    为了说明自己的看法，王茂先还给他讲述了一个自己的故事。
    有一次正是王茂先上第三班（即夜里十一点上班），那一天，他很困，为了怕自己睡过头，临睡前特别叮嘱他的老伴要她到了时间喊醒他。平常，不管王茂先做日班，做夜班，他的老伴不是等他去上班，就一直等他回来休息，可是这一天，偏偏他的老伴也睡着了。王茂先一觉醒来，离上班还有半点多钟，他饭也没有顾上吃，直奔电车站，而电车恰又刚刚开过去。他冒着风雪，一直跑到井口，离上班还有五分钟，人们正准备乘罐笼下井呢。
    王春生听了这个老人的话，心里很感动，从此以后他就不再旷工了。过去，王春生觉得利用工作的时间，做一点自己的事情，这是很便宜的事情；现在他翻了个儿，他尽力不再侵占工作的时间。不久以前，王春生结婚，家里要盘炕，要是在过去，他一定觉得请几天假，名正言顺，可是这一次，他却利用了星期天休息的日子盘炕，一天没有盘完，晚上又接着干了大半夜，第二天照常上班。矿山上很多人都说：“只要看看人家王大爷，自己就知道应该怎么干了。”
    在王茂先的家里，当然并不是什么事情也不需要他。一九五二年的新年里，他的三儿兆贵结婚，结婚对于矿工的家庭是一件大事。在旧社会，“煤黑子顶风还臭五十里”，几乎没有一个姑娘愿意嫁给矿工当妻子。今天自己的儿子结婚了，老人心里的喜欢是难以形容的。可是当亲戚们和朋友们都来齐了，王茂先却要告辞去参加他们矿上文化学习的开学典礼。
    “今天是你家大喜的日子，怎么你还走？”客人们说。
    “咱们都不是外人，你们给我看着就行啰！”他无限喜悦地宽心地说：“开学典礼嘛，我怎么能不去？”
    全家谁也劝不住他，过了中午十二点，他才回来。
    你们想想，像王茂先这样的人要他退休，这岂不是太使他难过了。“你也这样说，”当王兆贵告诉他，大家都希望他退休的时候，王茂先觉得连自己的儿子也对他太不了解了，他简直有点光火地说：“你怎么也用这些话来卡我？我如果已经是一块朽木，那末我也一定要让它好好烧完，不让他只冒烟，没有火光。”
    王兆贵没有办法，只好回来照直汇报，大家也觉得这老人的一片好心，也不能太执拗他了，商量的结果，是让王茂先以后在井下看放炮的仓库，不要再到“掌子”里去放炮了。
    王茂先听说要他看仓库，就说：“我年纪大了，眼睛不好，丢了炮怎么办？”又说：“这个领多少，那个领多少，我弄不清帐目怎么办？”反正他不乐意看仓库，最后，他几乎带一点恳求的样子说：“在‘掌子’里，我能溜跶溜跶，看仓库我实在坐不住。”他说得很真诚，使任何人听了都会同情他。
    第三采煤队的队部最后作了一个决定，这个决定既照顾了他的岁数，又关心到他的志愿。决定让王茂先在“道口”放炮，不再到“掌子”里去工作。
    现在，王茂先就在“道口”放炮呢。在跳舞会上张矿长又问起这件旧事情，王茂先好像有点不好意思地说：“我在矿山长大，几十年来，我的心在井下惯了，呆在上面我不行。”他微笑着回答说，声音说得很低，但语气是很坚决的。他觉得自己说来说去，无非还是这个老意见。
    又一场动人的乐曲在演奏起来，这一次不是别人邀请他去跳舞，而是一大群年轻人围着他，要求他讲讲过去的矿工，他们是怎样生活过来的。
