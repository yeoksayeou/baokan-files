Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th - According to Indian news sources: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the People's House on the 27th that the two chairmen of last year's Geneva Conference, Eden and Molotov, had assured India that they would take steps to provide the Vietnam International Commission with adequate protection. He said the commission intends to continue its work.

In response to a question, Nehru said that after receiving Nehru's letter, the two chairmen in Geneva consulted with each other and also with representatives from the United States and France. He said: "It is understood that all four of these countries have made every effort to urge the South Vietnamese government to take all necessary actions so that the International Commission can properly carry out its work and take steps to organize elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords."

Prime Minister Nehru said that detailed reports have now been received regarding the Saigon incident on July 20th. "The facts reported to us are as follows: There had been some demonstrations in Saigon for several days. The chairman of the commission, Desai, had come to India for consultations. He returned to Saigon on the morning of July 20th. Shortly thereafter, hundreds of young people holding sticks, daggers, and axes appeared outside the Queen's Hotel and the Gallieni Hotel, where the personnel of the Vietnam International Supervisory Commission resided. These people went from room to room on each floor of the hotel in batches. They broke into the rooms, cut off telephone lines, threatened the residents, and destroyed their personal property. Forty-four members of the commission, including the chairman, lost all of their personal belongings. A junior Indian staff member of the Laotian International Commission who was visiting Saigon was attacked and injured. Other members of the commission were not injured. The commission's vehicles parked outside the Queen's Hotel were burned."

He said: "It appears that the Vietnamese security police who were outside the hotel throughout did not interfere with the looting and arson. Only after the destruction had been carried out and the demonstrators had left the hotel did the security police come to deal with the situation."

He added: "It appears that these demonstrations and attacks on the International Commission were planned in advance. Because some demonstrations had occurred in the past, the commission had requested the authorities on July 13th to pay attention to the need to maintain order and provide adequate security. Clearly, this request was not heeded."

Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: "According to Article 25 of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, the commanders of both sides' forces shall provide all possible protection, assistance, and cooperation to the International Commission and its inspection teams in completing the responsibilities and tasks assigned to them by this agreement. Since the Geneva Accords were signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army and the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces in Indochina, the latter bears primary responsibility for the peace and security of the International Commission in South Vietnam. However, since the maintenance of law and order in South Vietnam now appears to be controlled by the State of Vietnam, we believe that the South Vietnamese government is equally responsible as the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces to provide this protection."

Nehru said: "The Indian government assumed the chairmanship of the International Commission with the clear understanding of protection and cooperation from the governments concerned. It is quite obvious that the International Commission cannot carry out its work unless it receives full security and protection. The International Commission intends to continue its work, hoping that the efforts of the two chairmen will be successful and that their instructions will be heeded."

    印度总理尼赫鲁谴责西贡暴行事件
    新华社新德里二十八日电　据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在人民院说，去年日内瓦会议的两位主席艾登和莫洛托夫已经向印度保证，他们将采取步骤以给予越南国际委员会以足够的保护。他说，委员会打算继续进行它的工作。
    尼赫鲁在答复问题时说，两位主席在日内瓦收到了尼赫鲁的信件之后，就彼此进行磋商，还同美国和法国的代表进行了磋商。他说：“据悉，所有这四个国家都竭力敦促南越政府采取一切必要的行动，以便国际委员会能适当地进行工作，并且采取步骤，根据日内瓦协定组织选举。”
    尼赫鲁总理说，现在已经收到关于七月二十日西贡事件的详细报告。“向我们报告的事实是这样：好几天来在西贡一直有一些示威。委员会的主席德赛曾来印度进行磋商。他在七月二十日早晨回到西贡。不久以后，几百个持有棍子、短刀和斧头的青少年出现在越南国际监察委员会人员居住的皇后旅馆和加利埃尼旅馆的外面。这些人分批在旅馆各层楼从一间房间走到另一间房间，他们冲进了各个房间，割断了电话线，威胁住客并且毁坏他们的私人财物。委员会的四十四个成员，包括主席在内，丧失了他们的全部私人财物。在西贡访问的老挝国际委员会的低级印度人员遭到攻击并且受伤。委员会的其他委员没有受伤。停在皇后旅馆外面的委员会的车辆被焚毁。”
    他说：“看来，自始至终都在旅馆外面的越南保安警察并没有干涉抢劫和放火。只是在进行了破坏，示威者已经离开了旅馆以后，治安警察才来处理这个局面。”
    他又说：“看来，这些示威和对国际委员会的进攻是预先策划好了的。由于过去曾经发生过一些示威，委员会曾在七月十三日要求当局注意有必要来维持治安以及提供适当的安全。显然，这种要求没有受到注意。”
    尼赫鲁总理指出：“根据越南的日内瓦协定第二十五条的规定，双方部队司令官对于国际委员会及其视察小组在完成这个协定所赋予的职责和任务中，应当给予一切可能的保护、协助和合作。由于日内瓦协定是越南人民军总司令和印度支那的法兰西联邦部队总司令所签订的，后者就对在南越的国际委员会的平安和安全负有主要的责任。但是，由于南越的治安维持工作现在看来是由越南国控制的，因此，我们认为，南越政府和法兰西联邦部队总司令一样有责任来给予这种保护。”
    尼赫鲁说：“印度政府是在得到有关政府的保护和合作这一清楚谅解下担任国际委员会主席的。十分明显，除非国际委员会得到充分的安全和保护，它是无法进行工作的。国际委员会打算继续进行它的工作，希望两位主席的努力将获得成功，他们的指示将受到注意。”
