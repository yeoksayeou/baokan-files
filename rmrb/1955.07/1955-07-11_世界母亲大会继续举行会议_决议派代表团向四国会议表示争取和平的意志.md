She pointed out that none of the members of the Soviet delegation attending the congress had not lost loved ones in the war. She described the Soviet Union's care for mothers and the Soviet Union's pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy. She said that Soviet mothers, like mothers in other countries, hoped that the upcoming meeting of the heads of government of the four powers would make decisions to ease international tensions. It is the duty of mothers all over the world to promote the realization of peaceful cooperation. Mothers are a great force in the struggle for life, for the future of children, and for the progress of mankind.
    A French mother representative, the widow of the late famous French writer Bloch, suggested in her speech that the congress send a delegation to petition the participants of the Four-Power Conference, telling them the will of hundreds of millions of women who desire world peace.

    A French female representative then stood up and read a letter from a French mother whose son had died in Algeria, saying that mothers all over the world should unite their forces and rise up against war.
    Amidst enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, the French women's delegation presented flowers to the mothers of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and other French dependencies, expressing solidarity with their struggles for peace and national liberation.
