Xinhua News Agency, July 18th – The Second Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China held a plenary meeting from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM this afternoon. The Executive Chairmen were: Huang Yanpei, Liu Lantao, Cai Chang, Peng Zemin, Ye Shengtao, Kui Bi, and Chen Shaokuan.

Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, delivered a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Fundamentally Controlling the Yellow River's Water Damage and Developing Yellow River Water Conservancy" on behalf of the State Council. His report was interrupted by warm applause time and again.

Deng Zihui said that the Yellow River issue is a concern for the people of the whole country. The Yellow River is the second largest river in our country, with a total length of 4,845 kilometers. The Yellow River basin has a cultivated area of 656 million mu, accounting for 40% of the country's cultivated area. The Yellow River basin is rich in coal, oil, iron, copper, aluminum, and other large amounts of mineral deposits. In the provinces and regions of the Yellow River basin, industry is developing rapidly, and many new industrial cities and industrial bases are under construction.

The Yellow River basin also has a very important resource, which is the Yellow River water system itself. If the Yellow River can be fully utilized in power generation, irrigation, navigation, and other aspects, it will have great significance for the development of industry and agriculture in the Yellow River basin and even the entire national industrialization and electrification cause. However, the current state of the Yellow River cannot make such a great contribution. Not only that, the Yellow River often becomes a major threat to the Yellow River basin and the whole country.

Deng Zihui said that the Yellow River is a famous disastrous river both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Its disaster is mainly water damage. This is not only because of the summer rainstorms in the Yellow River basin, but more importantly because of the silt deposition in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Serious water disasters are concentrated in the lower reaches. When encountering larger floods, the lower reaches of the Yellow River will experience serious disasters such as flooding, breaches, and even changes in course. According to historical records, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have experienced flooding and breaches more than 1,500 times in more than 3,000 years, with 26 major changes in course, including 9 major changes. The Yellow River's disasters often affect the Hai River basin, the Huai River basin, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, threatening the safety of more than 80 million people in an area of 250,000 square kilometers.

The fate of the lower reaches of the Yellow River has undergone a significant change in the era of people's democracy. The Communist Party of China and the People's Government have led the people to wage a tenacious struggle against the Yellow River's disasters. Since the restoration of the Huayuankou levee in 1946, the People's Governments in the liberated areas on both sides of the Yellow River have actively led the people to prevent and control the Yellow River's water damage. In the past nine years, we have reversed the dangerous situation of almost annual breaches in the Yellow River in the past century, and guaranteed the safety of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. However, the Yellow River's water damage cannot be said to have been eliminated. In addition to serious water damage, the Yellow River also suffers from the serious hazards of soil erosion in the middle reaches and the serious drought disasters in the entire basin. These have caused great damage to agricultural production.

Deng Zihui then pointed out that our task on the Yellow River issue is not only to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water damage, but also to simultaneously prevent soil erosion in the Yellow River basin and eliminate drought disasters in the Yellow River basin; not only to eliminate the Yellow River's water and drought disasters, but especially to fully utilize the Yellow River's water resources for irrigation, power generation, and navigation, to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and transportation. In short, we must completely conquer the Yellow River and transform the natural conditions of the Yellow River basin in order to fundamentally change the economic outlook of the Yellow River basin and meet the requirements of the entire national economy for Yellow River resources in the current era of socialist construction and the future era of communist construction.

Deng Zihui then pointed out the principles and methods we should adopt. He said that in our country's history, the broad masses of the people have continuously waged great struggles against the Yellow River's water damage. However, none of those who governed the Yellow River in the past were able to fundamentally solve the Yellow River problem. This is because they only tried to find ways to send water and sediment away in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Facts have proven that water and sediment cannot be "sent" away completely, and the policy of sending away water and sediment cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Today, we must seek a thorough and comprehensive solution to the Yellow River problem, not only to eradicate water damage but also to develop water conservancy. Based on this requirement, the policy we should adopt for the Yellow River is not to send away water and sediment, but to control and utilize water and sediment. This requires relying on two methods: first, building a series of dams and reservoirs on the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River. Second, carrying out large-scale soil and water conservation work in areas with serious soil erosion in the Yellow River basin, mainly in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces. From the plateau to the mountain gullies, from the tributaries to the main stream, storing water section by section, intercepting sediment section by section, doing everything possible to use river water in industry, agriculture, and transportation, and keeping the loess and rainwater on farmland: this is the basic method for controlling the Yellow River's water and sediment, fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water damage, and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy.

Deng Zihui then described the compilation process of the Yellow River planning and design documents, and then explained the long-term plan and the first-stage plan of the Yellow River's comprehensive utilization plan. The main content of the long-term plan is first of all the "Yellow River Main Stream Cascade Development Plan," which is to build a series of dams on the main stream of the Yellow River, thereby transforming the Yellow River into a "terraced river." This plan proposes to divide the middle reaches of the Yellow River into four sections from Longyangxia in Guide, Qinghai, to Taohua峪 in Chenggao, Henan, according to the characteristics of the river, and utilize them separately. According to preliminary designs, 44 dams suitable for different conditions and different tasks are planned to be built in the four river sections in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. In addition, two dams for irrigation are planned to be built in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, for a total of 46 dams.

The Yellow River Main Stream Cascade Development Plan has selected the Sanmenxia area in Shanxian County to build the largest and most important comprehensive project for flood control, power generation, and irrigation. The Sanmenxia river channel is narrow, and the riverbed is all solid rock, which is convenient for building large dams. The river water blocked by this dam will form a huge reservoir; its volume will be second only to the reservoir of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station; its area is about 2,350 square kilometers, which is larger than Taihu Lake. In addition, large-scale comprehensive water conservancy projects will also be built in Longyangxia and Jishixia in Qinghai, and Liujiaxia and Heishanxia in Gansu. Among them, the Liujiaxia Reservoir has a capacity of 4.9 billion cubic meters. Several reservoirs are also planned to be built on the important tributaries of the Yellow River, a few of which are comprehensive projects, and most of which are for intercepting sediment from the tributaries.

Deng Zihui said that after a series of dams are built on the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River, the following changes will occur in the Yellow River basin: First, the disaster of the Yellow River flood can be completely avoided. The downstream river water will become clear water, the riverbed will continue to be deepened, and the river channel will become increasingly stable. Therefore, the various flood control burdens of the downstream people can be lifted in the future. Second, the 46 dams on the main stream of the Yellow River can be used to generate 23 million kilowatts of electricity, with an average annual power generation of 110 billion kilowatt-hours. This will provide cheap power for the industry and transportation of Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and other places, as well as modernized agriculture, electrify this vast area, and save the country a large amount of fuel coal. The reservoirs on the tributaries of the Yellow River can also generate electricity. Third, the area of irrigated land in the Yellow River can be expanded from the current 16.5 million mu to 116 million mu, accounting for more than 65% of the total land area in the Yellow River basin that needs to be irrigated by the Yellow River. Fourth, after the 46 dams are built and ship-passing devices are installed, the water volume in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River can be adjusted as needed, so the entire line can be navigable. Five-hundred-ton tugboats will be able to sail from Haikou to Lanzhou.

Deng Zihui pointed out that while implementing the Yellow River Main Stream Cascade Development Plan, large-scale soil and water conservation work must also be carried out in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other loess areas. Only by carrying out a series of long-term soil and water conservation work in the loess area from the aspects of farming technology, field engineering, afforestation, and water conservancy can we fundamentally prevent the downflow of sediment and prolong the life of the mainstream reservoir. After explaining the various measures for soil and water conservation, Deng Zihui pointed out that after the plan is fully realized, the face of the loess area will be greatly changed, and agricultural production as well as forestry and animal husbandry production in this area will be greatly increased. The Yellow River's flood disaster problem will also be fundamentally solved.

Deng Zihui then introduced the first phase of the plan. He said that it will take decades to fully realize the long-term plan for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River, for example, it will take 50 years to fully realize the long-term plan for soil and water conservation. In order to first solve the most urgent problems of flood control, power generation, irrigation and other aspects of the Yellow River, the Yellow River Planning Commission proposed the first phase of the plan to be implemented before 1967. The first phase of the plan stipulates that comprehensive projects should be built first in Sanmenxia downstream of Shanxian and Liujiaxia upstream of Lanzhou. The Sanmenxia project has a decisive effect on preventing flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. At the same time, the hydroelectric power station built in Sanmenxia can generate 1 million kilowatts, which can meet the needs of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and other places in industry and other aspects for a considerable period of time. The Liujiaxia Reservoir's hydroelectric power station can also generate 1 million kilowatts, which can meet the electricity needs of the newly developed industrial zone in Gansu. The Liujiaxia Reservoir can also guarantee the irrigation and navigation needs of the former Ningxia and Suiyuan provinces in the downstream area.

Deng Zihui said that the Sanmenxia Reservoir and Hydropower Station are scheduled to start construction in 1957 and be completed in 1961. The reservoirs on the tributaries downstream of Sanmenxia are also scheduled to be completed before 1964.

Deng Zihui said that in terms of irrigation, according to the first phase of the plan, 30.25 million mu of irrigated land will be expanded; at the same time, the irrigation status of the original 11.98 million mu of irrigated area will be improved. The completion of the first phase of the plan will make many sections of the Yellow River navigable, and the navigable distance accounts for about half of the entire length of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The first phase of soil and water conservation work is also a huge plan. Among them, the area of improved cultivated land alone reaches 127 million mu, and the area of improved natural pastures reaches 134.6 million mu. In addition, it is necessary to cultivate artificial pastures, plant orchards, stop cultivating steep slopes, build terraces, build terraces with interception ditches, build cultivated land with field ridges, afforestation and seedling cultivation, close hillsides for afforestation, build water cellars, build flood storage ponds, build road ditch water storage weirs, build ditch head protection equipment, build valley workshops, build silt dams, implement small-scale irrigation, build water flooding land, build gully earth dams, repair roads in gully areas, etc. It requires the active support of the broad masses of farmers, and requires the government and farmers to jointly invest a large amount of capital. The realization of this plan will double local agricultural production, and the Yellow River's sediment will be reduced by about half after the completion of this plan and the construction plan of sediment interception reservoirs in tributaries.

Deng Zihui said that in order to implement the first phase of the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan, it is initially estimated that an investment of 5.324 billion yuan will be required. This is a large investment. But this investment is completely worthwhile. After the completion of the first phase of the plan, from the irrigation aspect alone, the annual increase in grain production can be 5.47 billion jin, and the annual increase in cotton production can be 400 million jin. The value of these two items of increased production reaches 856 million yuan per year, and 8.56 billion yuan in ten years, greatly exceeding the total value of the fifteen-year investment. Looking at it from the perspective of power generation, the electricity generated by the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations each year is worth 588 million yuan, and the income in ten years also exceeds the total value of the fifteen-year investment. The completion of the first phase of the plan will also generate huge economic benefits in terms of shipping. What's more, the first phase of the plan fundamentally solves the Yellow River's flood problem, and the cost of flood control alone can save 20 million yuan per year.

Deng Zihui pointed out that in order to realize this plan, not only the efforts of the government are needed, but also the efforts of the people of the whole country are needed. There is no doubt that the people of the whole country will resolutely support the implementation of this great plan in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. The people of all provinces and regions in the Yellow River basin will make the greatest contribution in the process of implementing this plan. The farmers of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, the people's committees at all levels of the provinces, counties, and townships of the three provinces, the Communist Party members and the staff of the local organizations at all levels of the democratic parties and people's organizations of the three provinces bear the most important responsibility for the implementation of the soil and water conservation plan. We believe that for their own interests, the interests of their localities, and the interests of the people of the whole country, they will surely be able to fully shoulder their responsibilities.

Deng Zihui said that the formulation of the Yellow River plan shows that our country's water conservancy cause is advancing rapidly. We will not only fundamentally control and develop the Yellow River, but also fundamentally control and develop the Yangtze River and other important rivers. The planning of the Yangtze River will collect data during the first five-year plan period, formulate plans during the second five-year plan period, and gradually start implementation. In October 1954, the government submitted a request to the Soviet government to hire a comprehensive team of experts to assist our country in the Yangtze River planning. The Soviet government has once again generously agreed to our request. Deng Zihui expressed gratitude to the Soviet Union for its great assistance to our country in the Yellow River planning, the Sanmenxia project design, and the Yangtze River planning.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th – Most of the delegation groups of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress continued to discuss the draft of the First Five-Year Plan this morning. Individual delegation groups have begun to discuss the 1954 national final accounts and the 1955 national budget.

In today's and the past few days' group discussions, many representatives have emphasized that the realization of the First Five-Year Plan will be an extremely complex and sharp class struggle, but many people do not have enough understanding of this point. Many representatives talked about the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries in many aspects such as capital construction, industrial production, agricultural cooperativization, and the unified purchase and sale of grain, which they learned during this factory and rural inspection work, illustrating that the class struggle in cities and villages today is complex and sharp. They also pointed out that from the materials exposed by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, people have a deeper understanding that the enemy is using more hidden and clever methods to sabotage our socialist construction cause.

The representatives also cited many examples to illustrate that the staff in state organs, people's organizations, factories, and villages are not highly politically vigilant against counter-revolutionaries, and many people turn a blind eye to the sabotage activities of hidden enemies. Some representatives said that this rural inspection saw the sharpness of the rural class struggle, which was a profound class education for themselves. In the future, we must further closely contact the masses of the people, widely publicize and explain the First Five-Year Plan to the masses of the people, and promptly expose the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, rely on and mobilize the masses of the people to carry out the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. Only in this way can we ensure the victorious realization of the First Five-Year Plan.

This morning, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the First National People's Congress held a meeting to discuss the review of the draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China. The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress held a meeting in the afternoon to listen to the group review opinions on the draft of the 1954 national final accounts and the draft of the 1955 national budget.

    全国人民代表大会举行全体会议
    邓子恢作关于黄河规划的报告
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议十八日下午五时到六时三十分举行全体会议。执行主席是：黄炎培、刘澜涛、蔡畅、彭泽民、叶圣陶、奎璧、陈绍宽。
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理邓子恢代表国务院在会议上作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。他的报告一次又一次地被热烈的掌声所打断。
    邓子恢说，黄河问题是全国人民所关心的。黄河是我国第二大河，全长四千八百四十五公里。黄河流域共有耕地面积六亿五千六百万亩，占全国耕地面积百分之四十。黄河流域的地下富有煤、石油、铁、铜、铝和其他大量矿藏。在黄河流域各省区，工业正在迅速发展，许多新的工业城市和工业基地正在建设中。
    黄河流域还有一项非常重要的资源，这就是黄河水系本身。黄河如能在发电、灌溉、航运等方面加以充分利用，对黄河流域的工业和农业的发展以至整个国家工业化和电气化事业有伟大的意义。但是黄河目前的状况还不能作出这样伟大的贡献。不但如此，黄河还常常成为黄河流域以及全国的一个大威胁。
    邓子恢说，黄河是古今中外著名的一条灾害性的河流。它的灾害主要是水灾。这不但是因为黄河流域的夏季暴雨，更重要的还是由于黄河下游的泥沙淤积。严重的水灾集中在下游。遇到较大的洪水，黄河下游就要发生泛滥、决口以至改道的严重灾害。据历史记载，黄河下游在三千多年中发生泛滥、决口一千五百多次，重要的改道二十六次，其中大的改道九次。黄河的灾害往往波及海河流域、淮河流域和长江下游，威胁二十五万平方公里上八千余万人口的安全。
    黄河下游的命运在人民民主时代得到了显著的转变。中国共产党和人民政府领导人民群众对黄河的灾害作了顽强的斗争。从一九四六年花园口复堤起，黄河两岸解放区人民政府就积极领导人民防治黄河的水害。在过去九年中，我们扭转了黄河近百年间几乎每年决口的险恶局面，保证了黄河下游的安全。但是，黄河水害还不能说已经消除。除了严重的水害以外，黄河还有中游地区的水土流失的严重危害和整个流域的严重的旱灾。这些都使农业生产受到很大的损害。
    邓子恢接着指出，我们在黄河问题上的任务，就是不但要从根本上治理黄河的水害，而且要同时制止黄河流域的水土流失和消除黄河流域的旱灾；不但要消除黄河的水旱灾害，尤其要充分利用黄河的水利资源来进行灌溉、发电和通航，来促进农业、工业和运输业的发展。总之，我们要彻底征服黄河，改造黄河流域的自然条件，以便从根本上改变黄河流域的经济面貌，满足现在的社会主义建设时代和将来的共产主义建设时代整个国民经济对于黄河资源的要求。
    邓子恢接着指出我们应当采取的方针和方法。他说，在我国历史上，广大的人民曾经不断地同黄河的水害作过伟大的斗争。但是一切过去时代治理黄河的人都没有能从根本上解决黄河问题。这是因为他们只是想办法在黄河下游送走水，送走泥沙。事实已经证明，水和泥沙是“送”不完的，送走水、送走泥沙的方针是不能根本解决问题的。我们今天在黄河问题上必须求得彻底解决，通盘解决，不但要根除水害，而且要开发水利。从这个要求出发，我们对于黄河所应当采取的方针就不是把水和泥沙送走，而是要对水和泥沙加以控制，加以利用。这需要依靠两个方法：第一，在黄河的干流和支流上修建一系列的拦河坝和水库。第二，在黄河流域水土流失严重的地区，主要地是甘肃、陕西、山西三省展开大规模的水土保持工作。从高原到山沟，从支流到干流，节节蓄水，分段拦泥，尽一切可能把河水用在工业、农业和运输业上，把黄土和雨水留在农田上：——这就是控制黄河的水和泥沙、根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的基本方法。
    邓子恢接着在叙述了黄河规划设计文件的编制经过后，说明了黄河综合利用规划的远景计划和第一期计划。远景计划的主要内容，首先就是“黄河干流阶梯开发计划”，也就是在黄河干流上修建一系列的拦河坝，从而把黄河改造成为“梯河”的计划。这一计划拟定由青海贵德上游龙羊峡起，到河南成皋桃花峪止，按照河流的特点，把黄河中游分做四段来分别加以利用。根据初步设计，在黄河中游的四个河段准备修建适应于不同条件不同任务的拦河坝四十四座，另外在黄河下游也准备修建用于灌溉的拦河坝两座，共为四十六座。
    黄河干流阶梯开发计划已选定的陕县三门峡地方修建一座最大和最重要的防洪、发电、灌溉的综合性工程。三门峡河道窄狭，河底都是坚固的岩石，便于修建大型的水坝。被这个水坝拦阻的河水将形成巨大的水库；它的容积将仅次于世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站的水库；它的面积约为二千三百五十平方公里，比太湖还大些。此外，在青海的龙羊峡、积石峡和甘肃的刘家峡、黑山峡，也将修建大型的综合性水利工程。其中刘家峡水库容积可达四十九亿公方。在黄河的重要支流还计划修若干处水库，其中的少数是综合性工程，多数是为着拦蓄支流的泥沙。
    邓子恢说，在黄河干流支流一系列的水坝修成以后，黄河流域将发生如下的变化：第一，黄河洪水的灾害可以完全避免。下游河水将变为清水，河身将不断刷深，河槽将日趋稳定。因此，现在下游人民的各种防洪负担，将来都可以解除。第二，利用黄河干流上的四十六座拦河坝可以发电二千三百万瓩，每年平均发电量达到一千一百亿度。这将使青海、甘肃、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、河北等地工业以及交通运输业和现代化的农业得到廉价的电源，使这个广大地区电气化，并将为国家节约大量燃料用煤。黄河支流上的水库也都可以发电。第三，黄河灌溉土地的面积可以由现在的一千六百五十万亩扩大到一亿一千六百万亩，占黄河流域需要由黄河灌溉的全部土地面积百分之六十五强。第四，在四十六座拦河坝修成并安装过船装置以后，黄河中下游的水量可以按照需要来调节，因此就可以全线通航。五百吨拖船将能由海口航行到兰州。
    邓子恢指出，在实行黄河干流阶梯开发计划的时候，必须同时在甘肃、陕西、山西三省和其他黄土区域展开大规模的水土保持工作。只有在黄土区域从农作技术方面，田间工程方面，造林方面和水利方面进行一系列的长时期的水土保持工作，才能从根本上制止泥沙的下泻，并延长干流水库的寿命。邓子恢在说明了保持水土的各项措施以后指出，计划完全实现以后，黄土区域的面貌将大为改变，这一区域的农业生产以及林业牧业生产都将大为增加。而黄河的水灾问题也将得到根本的解决。
    邓子恢接着介绍了这个规划的第一期计划。他说，完全实现黄河综合利用规划的远景计划需要几十年时间，例如完全实现水土保持的远景计划将需要五十年时间。为了首先解决黄河的防洪、发电、灌溉和其他方面最迫切的问题，黄河规划委员会提出了在一九六七年以前实施的第一期计划。第一期计划规定首先在陕县下游的三门峡和兰州上游的刘家峡修建综合性工程。三门峡工程对于防止黄河下游洪水灾害有决定性的作用。同时，在三门峡修建的水电站可以发电一百万瓩，可以供给陕西、山西、河南等地相当时期内在工业上和其他方面的需要。刘家峡水库的水电站也可以发电一百万瓩，可以使甘肃一带新发展的工业区用电需要得到满足。刘家峡水库还可以保证下游原宁夏、绥远省境灌溉和航运的需要。
    邓子恢说，三门峡水库和水电站拟定在一九五七年开始施工，到一九六一年完成。三门峡下游支流的水库也拟定在一九六四年以前完成。
    邓子恢说，在灌溉方面，按照第一期计划，将扩大灌溉土地三千零二十五万亩；同时，将对原有灌溉区一千一百九十八万亩的灌溉状况加以改善。第一期计划完成的结果，将使黄河的许多段可以通航，通航距离约占黄河中下游全长的一半。第一期的水土保持工作也是一个巨大的计划。其中仅改良耕作面积就达一亿二千七百万亩，改良天然牧场就达一亿三千四百六十万亩。此外，还要培植人工牧场、种植果园、停耕陡坡、修梯田、修带截水沟的梯田、修地边埂的耕地、造林育苗、封山育林、修水窖、修涝池、修路濠蓄水堰、修沟头防护设备、修谷坊、修淤地坝、实施小型灌溉、修水漫地、修沟壑土坝、修理沟壑区道路等等。它需要广大农民积极支持，并且需要政府和农民共同进行大量的投资。实现了这一计划，当地农业生产量将增加一倍，而黄河的泥沙在这一计划和支流拦泥水库修建计划完成以后，则将减少一半左右。
    邓子恢说，为了实施黄河综合利用规划的第一期工程，初步估算需要投资五十三亿二千四百万元。这是一笔很大的投资。但是这笔投资是完全值得的。第一期计划完成后，仅仅从灌溉方面说，每年就可以增产粮食五十四亿七千斤，棉花四亿斤，这两项增产的价值，每年达到八亿五千六百万元，十年就是八十五亿六千万元，大大超过了十五年投资的总值。再从发电方面看，三门峡和刘家峡两座水电站每年发的电就值五亿八千八百万元，十年的收入也超过了十五年投资的总值。第一期计划的完成在航运方面也将产生巨大的经济效益，何况第一期计划根本解决了黄河的洪水问题，只是用于防汛的费用就可以省下每年两千万元。
    邓子恢指出，为了实现这一规划，不仅仅需要政府的努力，还需要全国人民的努力。毫无疑问，全国人民将在人力上、物力上、财力上坚决地支持这一伟大计划的实施。黄河流域各省区的人民，将在这一计划实施的过程中作出最大的贡献。甘肃、陕西、山西三省农民，三省的省、县、乡各级人民委员会，三省的共产党员和各民主党派、各人民团体的各级地方组织的工作人员，对于水土保持计划的执行负有最重要的责任。我们相信，他们为了自身利益、本地方的利益和全国人民的利益，一定能够把他们的责任充分地担负起来。
    邓子恢说，黄河规划的拟定说明我国的水利事业正在迅速前进。我们不但要根治和开发黄河，而且要根治和开发长江以及其他重要河流。关于长江的规划将在第一个五年计划期间收集资料，在第二个五年计划期间制定规划并逐步地着手实施。政府在一九五四年十月向苏联政府提出了聘请协助我国进行长江规划的专家综合组的要求，苏联政府已经又一次慷慨地同意了我们的要求。邓子恢对苏联在黄河规划、三门峡工程设计和长江规划方面对我国的巨大的援助，表示感谢。
    新华社十八日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天上午大部分代表小组继续讨论第一个五年计划草案。个别代表小组已开始讨论一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算。
    在今天和前几天的分组讨论中，许多代表都着重指出：实现第一个五年计划，将是一个极为复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争，但是有许多人对这一点是认识不够的。许多代表谈到了这次下厂下乡视察工作中所了解的反革命分子在基本建设、工业生产、农业合作化、粮食统购统销等许多方面的破坏活动情况，说明今天城市和农村中的阶级斗争是复杂而尖锐的。他们并且指出：从揭露出来的胡风反革命集团的材料，使人们更深刻地认识到敌人是在用更隐蔽更巧妙的办法来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。
    代表们还举出许多事例，说明国家机关、人民团体、工厂和农村中的工作人员，对反革命分子的政治警惕性是不高的，许多人对暗藏敌人的破坏活动熟视无睹。有些代表说，这次下乡视察，看到农村阶级斗争的尖锐，对自己是一番深刻的阶级教育。今后必须更加密切联系人民群众，向人民群众广泛宣传和解释第一个五年计划，并且及时揭露反革命分子的破坏活动，依靠和发动人民群众进行肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，只有这样，才能保证第一个五年计划胜利实现。
    今天上午，第一届全国人民代表大会法案委员会举行会议，讨论了审查中华人民共和国兵役法草案的问题。第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会在下午举行会议，听取了对一九五四年国家决算草案和一九五五年国家预算草案的分组审查意见。
