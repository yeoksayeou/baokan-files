    The World Congress of Mothers was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, from July 7th to July 10th, for four days, discussing the common issues of greatest concern to mothers around the world. This was the first World Congress of Mothers in human history. Among the more than 1,200 delegates from 66 countries who participated in the conference, there were ministers and parliamentarians, writers and journalists, female workers and farmers, housewives and university students, as well as people from various professions; more than half of them had never participated in any international conference before. They came from countries with different systems, with different political and religious beliefs, different views, and different social status. A sacred common desire brought them together from all over the world to Lausanne, where they discussed the current pressing international situation in a very sincere atmosphere. This common desire is, as stated in the conference declaration: to defend children from war and ensure them a peaceful and happy future.

    Mothers from all countries who create and nurture life cannot but closely watch the development of the international situation. They are disturbed to see that the war forces headed by the United States are constantly expanding their armaments, establishing military blocs and military bases, preparing for atomic warfare, undermining the independence of various nations, conducting "cold war" propaganda, creating international hatred and fear, and causing the serious danger of a new war to threaten the survival of all mankind and the lives of children all over the world. They realize that they must act together to take on the noble responsibility of protecting the lives of their children.

    The recent developments in the international situation have convinced mothers in all countries that war is not inevitable. The success of the Asian-African Conference and the fact that the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies and many other countries are becoming more and more frequent prove that peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems is entirely possible. The signing of the Austrian State Treaty has once again powerfully demonstrated that outstanding international issues can be resolved through consultation on the basis of international trust and understanding. After the Soviet Union put forward new proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, there was a good opportunity for the major powers to reach an agreement on disarmament. The new and fruitful efforts made by the peace-loving forces to consolidate peace have given great encouragement to mothers in all countries, making them firmly believe that as long as hundreds of millions of mothers around the world unite, they can strive for further easing of the international situation and save their children from the threat of another new world war. With the determination to prevent another great war, stemming from the memory of the suffering of war and the belief in maintaining peace, they have sent out their call of motherly love to the world.

    Mothers of all countries have expressed their legitimate expectations for the upcoming meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers, and they eagerly hope that the meeting will be successful. In a letter to the heads of government of the four major powers, the World Congress of Mothers called for: resolving disputes through means other than resorting to force; establishing a collective security system through the principles of peaceful coexistence affirmed by the Bandung Conference; creating conditions for universal disarmament; immediately reaching an agreement to ban atomic weapons and broadly developing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy; eliminating obstacles that hinder international mutual understanding; and taking measures to ensure economic, social, and cultural cooperation to strengthen friendship and understanding among the peoples of all countries. The mothers of all countries believe that the meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers should not fail to meet their hopes. The sincerity of governments towards peace will be tested by their answers to these demands raised by mothers of all countries.

    Mothers of all countries hope that the United Nations can fulfill the provisions of the United Nations Charter. They expressed concern about war preparations and the arms race, and called on the United Nations to thoroughly complete the tasks it undertook at its founding—to protect the growing generation from war. They expressed their support for any initiatives and efforts made by the United Nations to stop war preparations, reduce armaments, ban atomic weapons, condemn interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and resolve disputes through negotiations.

    The World Congress of Mothers called on mothers around the world to unite to defend peace. The conference declaration pointed out that there is no reason for the people of all countries to be hostile to each other. The things that separate them are negligible compared to the things that unite them. "We do not want war." This is the determination that mothers of all countries have declared to the world through this conference. Mothers angrily condemned the idea of using atomic weapons and demanded that atomic energy be used entirely for peaceful purposes. They demanded that huge military expenditures be used to build houses, hospitals, schools, and maternity hospitals, to improve the upbringing of children and raise the living standards of the people. They opposed spreading hatred and racial prejudice among human beings, and advocated that people of all countries and races have equal rights to life.

    The declaration and other documents of the conference pointed out the direction of action for mothers all over the world. It is a great contribution to further promoting the movement of people of all countries to defend peace and strive for further easing of the international situation. There is no doubt that these just calls from mothers of all countries should and will be warmly supported by all honest people.

    Chinese mothers, like all Chinese people, hate war and love peace. They firmly support the peaceful diplomatic policy of our country's government, strive to create an international peaceful environment for the construction of the motherland, and create a better future for their children. They will never allow anyone to use war to destroy the factories and farms, schools and parks, nurseries and sanatoriums... that they have built with their own hands. Chinese mothers have always stood at the forefront of defending world peace, and they have actively participated in all signature campaigns against the use of atomic weapons and demanding the conclusion of a five-power pact. At this World Congress of Mothers, the representatives of Chinese mothers expressed the strong peaceful will of Chinese mothers and all Chinese people. Chinese mothers and all Chinese people have always advocated the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, demanded the resolution of international issues by peaceful means, and strived for the easing of international tensions. The resolutions of the World Congress of Mothers have given great encouragement to Chinese mothers and all Chinese people who are engaged in peaceful construction and defending their motherland. Chinese mothers, together with all Chinese people, are determined to dedicate all their strength to realizing the resolutions of the World Congress of Mothers.

    "United, we are invincible." - The moving and resounding call of the World Congress of Mothers resonates with the hearts of every mother and every peace-loving person. Let the mothers and people of the world unite to strive for the success of the meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers, to strive for an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to strive for further easing of the international situation. Those who nurture life must defend life! The peaceful will of mothers is invincible!

    母亲们的和平意志是不可战胜的
    世界母亲大会从七月七日到七月十日在瑞士洛桑举行了四天会议，讨论了全世界母亲们最关切的共同问题。这是人类历史上第一次的世界母亲大会。参加大会的六十六个国家的一千二百多位代表中间，有部长和议员，有作家和记者，有女工和农妇，有家庭主妇和大学生，以及各种职业的人；她们中间有半数以上的人过去从来没有参加过任何国际会议。她们来自制度不同的国家，有着不同的政治和宗教信仰、不同的观点和社会地位。一个神圣的共同愿望使她们从世界各地汇集到洛桑，在非常诚挚的气氛中会商当前迫切的国际局势问题。这个共同的愿望就是，如大会宣言所说的：保卫孩子免遭战争，保证他们有一个和平和幸福的将来。
    创造和抚育生命的各国母亲们不能不密切注视着国际局势的发展。她们不安地看到：以美国为首的战争势力不断扩充军备，建立军事集团和军事基地，准备原子战争，破坏各国民族的独立，进行“冷战”宣传，制造国际的仇恨和恐惧，使新战争的严重危险威胁着全世界人类的生存，威胁着全世界孩子们的生命。她们认识到，必须一致行动起来，担当起保卫孩子们的生命的崇高责任。
    最近国际局势的发展使各国母亲们相信，战争不是不可避免的。亚非会议的成功以及苏联和人民民主国家同其他许多国家间日益频繁的友好往来和合作的事实，证明制度不同的国家间的和平共处是完全可能的。奥地利国家条约的签订又一次有力地证明，悬而未决的国际问题能够在国际信任和谅解的基础上用协商的办法求得解决。在苏联提出新的裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议之后，各大国就裁军问题达成协议有了良好的机会。爱好和平力量对巩固和平所作的新的有成果的努力，给了各国母亲们以巨大的鼓舞，使她们坚信：只要全世界亿万母亲团结起来，就可以争取到国际局势的进一步缓和，就可以使自己的孩子免遭另一次新的世界战争的威胁。她们怀着从战争苦难的记忆和维护和平的信念中产生的制止另一次大战的决心，向全世界发出她们的母爱的号召。
    各国母亲们对即将召开的四大国政府首脑会议表示了正当的期望，她们热烈盼望这个会议能获得成功。世界母亲大会在给四大国政府首脑的信中呼吁：通过不是诉诸武力的办法解决争端；通过万隆会议所肯定的和平共处的原则建立集体安全体系；为普遍裁军创造条件；立即达成协议来禁止原子武器，并广泛发展和平利用原子能的国际合作；消除妨碍国际间相互谅解的障碍；采取措施来保证经济、社会、文化方面的合作，加强各国人民间的友好和谅解。各国母亲们认为四大国政府首脑会议不应辜负她们的希望。各国政府对和平的诚意将在它们回答各国母亲们提出的这些要求上受到考验。
    各国母亲们都希望联合国能够履行联合国宪章的规定。她们对战争准备和军备竞赛表示忧虑，呼吁联合国组织彻底完成它在创立时所承担的任务——保卫正在成长的一代免遭战争。她们表示支持联合国组织为停止战争准备、裁减军备、禁止原子武器、谴责干涉他国内政、以谈判方式解决争端而作的任何倡议和努力。
    世界母亲大会号召全世界的母亲们团结一致，保卫和平。大会宣言指出，各国人民毫无理由彼此敌对。使他们彼此分离的东西比起使他们团结一致的东西来是微不足道的。“我们不要战争。”这就是各国母亲们通过这次大会向全世界宣布的决心。母亲们愤怒地谴责使用原子武器的想法，要求把原子能完全用于和平用途。她们要求把巨额军费用于建立住宅、医院、学校和产科医院，用来改善对孩子们的抚养和提高人民生活水平。她们反对散布人类的憎恨和种族偏见，而主张让各国、各种族人民有平等的生活权利。
    大会的宣言和其他文件向全世界的母亲们指出了行动的方向。它对于进一步推进各国人民保卫和平的运动和争取进一步缓和国际局势是一个巨大的贡献。毫无疑问，各国母亲们发出的这些正义呼声，应该受到也一定会受到所有正直人民的热烈支持。
    中国的母亲们，和全中国人民一样憎恨战争，热爱和平。她们坚决支持我国政府的和平外交政策，努力为祖国的建设争取国际和平环境，为孩子们创造美好的未来。她们决不允许有人用战争来破坏她们亲手建造的工厂和农庄、学校和公园、托儿所和疗养院……。中国母亲们一直站在保卫世界和平的前列，她们踊跃参加了关于反对使用原子武器和要求缔结五大国公约的历次签名运动。在这次世界母亲大会上，中国母亲的代表们表达了中国母亲和全中国人民坚强的和平意志。中国母亲和全中国人民一向主张制度不同国家的和平共处，要求用和平方式解决国际问题，争取国际紧张局势的缓和。世界母亲大会的决议给予正在进行和平建设、捍卫祖国的中国母亲和全中国人民以巨大的鼓舞。中国的母亲们和全中国人民一起，决心为实现世界母亲大会的决议而献出一切力量。
    “团结起来，我们就是不可战胜的。”——世界母亲大会动人的响亮的号召和每一个母亲、每一个爱好和平的人民的心相呼应。让全世界母亲和全世界人民团结起来，为争取开好四大国政府首脑会议，争取达成裁减军备和禁止原子武器的协议，争取国际形势的进一步缓和而斗争。孕育生命的人一定要保卫生命！母亲们的和平意志是不可战胜的！
