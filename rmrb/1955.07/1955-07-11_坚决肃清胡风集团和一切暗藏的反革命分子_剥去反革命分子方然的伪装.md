    Resolutely Eliminate the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Expose the Counter-Revolutionary Fang Ran's Disguise
    Yì Chéng
    Fang Ran was a strategist of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and a key member of this clique who had long been lying dormant in Zhejiang to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. If Hu Feng elements like A Long and Ji Fang mostly used "literary work" as a cover for their counter-revolutionary activities, then in recent years, Fang Ran's counter-revolutionary activities have mainly appeared under the guise of a "professional revolutionary" and a "social activist." The reason for this was to hide outside the cultural sphere, in order to "form a scattered battle line" and undermine the revolutionary cause from all sides. Although he sometimes wrote articles or took advantage of various lectures and symposiums to vigorously promote reactionary ideas, defend the reactionary works of other Hu Feng elements, and viciously attack the Party's literary leadership, his arrogance was not as rampant as it had been when he had the support of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and his methods were not as blatant. Instead, he used things like "casual conversations" or "writing a bit of author research" to make veiled criticisms and insinuations, precisely using the method of "causing injuries that are not outwardly visible." Even if "insiders" saw his intentions, they could not "do anything about him." In the past few years, before this counter-revolutionary clique was exposed, many naive young people were intimidated by his "erudition"; many comrades, lacking vigilance, were deceived by his "positive, no 'distance' attitude" and "cultured" appearance. Now, let us strip away his disguise and take a look at some of his past ugly history!
    Like other key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Fang Ran had close ties with Kuomintang secret service agencies from very early on. Even before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he had joined the Kuomintang secret service organization "Revival Society." After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he pretended to be a "revolutionary," infiltrated the anti-Japanese democratic holy land of Yan'an among young students. Like A Long, he only lay dormant in Yan'an for a few months before quickly returning to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where he spread rumors that "Yan'an is under warlord rule," and therefore one must "return to the land of freedom." It was in this "land of freedom" that he faithfully inherited the tradition of Hu Feng's "Hope," and founded "Breathing," where he published reactionary articles such as "On Survival," "Cultural Panorama," and "'Subjective' and Truth," vigorously promoting bourgeois subjective idealism, and fiercely directing his spearhead at Yan'an, at the Party's literary leadership, and at Party member writers and non-Party revolutionary writers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, providing the Kuomintang secret service agencies with evidence and leads to persecute revolutionary writers. It was in this way that he freely opposed Communism for six or seven years in this "land of freedom." Not long after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Chongqing Kuomintang reactionaries arrested large numbers of patriotic youths, he was also arrested due to a minor misunderstanding. Some of the patriotic youths who were arrested with him were shot, and some were sent to concentration camps; but Fang Ran only stayed in the garrison headquarters for twenty days before he was freely flown to Nanjing, thanks to the "guarantee" of his master Hu Feng and the "activities" of his uncle, Zhu Jingyun, who was a senior advisor in the Kuomintang Military Commission. During his days "detained" in the Chongqing garrison headquarters, in addition to engaging in the most shameless and despicable acts, Fang Ran also wrote a notice slandering the Communist Party and the patriotic movement of young students, which was published in the Kuomintang's Central Daily News.
    In 1947, Fang Ran returned to his hometown of Anqing. At that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was "about to approach" "this small city," which was when Fang Ran felt that "the heinous Communists were stirring up his hometown" and realized that the end was near, and was "extremely distraught." He "fled" to Shanghai, and later to Hangzhou. As soon as he arrived in Hangzhou, he immediately received "help" from his uncle, Liu Shangzhi, who had served as deputy commander-in-chief of an army group and commander of the 39th Army in the Kuomintang reactionary army and was actively anti-Communist and anti-people, and founded the "Anhui Middle School," with the support of Chen Xueping, the minister of the Kuomintang Central Youth Department and a major secret service chief. Thereupon, the chief culprit Hu Feng planted counter-revolutionaries A Long, Ji Fang, Luo Luo, Zhu Guhuai... in this middle school, and established their "base" for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. The following year, before going to Hong Kong, Hu Feng personally came to Hangzhou to hold a secret meeting, where he arranged "new tasks" according to the new situation. Then, they took active action, with A Long "contacting" the police bureau on one hand, and Fang Ran disguising a group of Hu Feng elements he had cultivated on the other, sending them to the guerrilla areas to "join the army" by mixing them into the ranks of revolutionary youth.
    This "school" – "Anhui Middle School" – which Fang Ran had "painstakingly managed" before liberation, exposed its counter-revolutionary face in the early days of the nationwide campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1951. In addition to the fact that the chairman of the board was a reactionary military officer, there were also Kuomintang military officers who had "guarded" General Ye Ting, key members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and even key Kuomintang members who had disguised themselves and fled to Hangzhou on the eve of Nanjing's liberation. Fang Ran, who had always styled himself as a "revolutionary writer," ran such a so-called "progressive" "middle school" that hid so many counter-revolutionaries. Does the reason for this need to be explained?
    So, how did a counter-revolutionary element as notorious as Fang Ran hide, burrow into the ranks of the revolutionary people, and usurp important positions? It turned out that as the mainland was about to be liberated and Hangzhou was just becoming the people's territory, Hu Feng, far away in Beijing, wrote to Hu Feng element Peng Baishan, asking him to "find work for them," while nominating Hu Feng clique's key members such as Fang Ran, Ji Fang, and A Long as delegates to the preparatory committee for the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers; and, through "old connections" and Hu Feng elements who had infiltrated the Party, had historical proof materials written for Fang Ran. Since Hu Feng had planned and organized the fabrication of historical proof materials for Fang Ran and raised his status, this ferocious jackal was disguised as a gentle sheep. As Hu Feng said in his letter to Fang Ran after the disguise had been properly arranged: "Now that there is a letter of proof, your matter will probably be settled." Once the counter-revolutionary element had disguised himself as a revolutionary, Hu Feng wanted him to "join practical work as soon as possible" and infiltrate the revolutionary ranks. But Fang Ran knew that he was a counter-revolutionary element full of sins, and that it would not be easy to hide in the revolutionary ranks and usurp important positions to engage in destructive activities. Therefore, he even more cleverly played the trick of being two-faced to deceive the surrounding masses, especially to mislead the leadership. He sometimes appeared as a "celebrity in the education world" and an "old writer"; sometimes he appeared as a "social activist," quoting Marxist-Leninist phrases and the works of Chinese and foreign literary giants at length in his speeches and writings, and scolding those who "compromise," "surrender," "defect," and "betray" "in battle," as well as "individualists"... everywhere showing himself to be a revolutionary, in order to gain everyone's attention and trust. In this way, he successively usurped the positions of standing committee member of the provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles preparatory committee, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Hangzhou Municipal Association of Literary Workers, and director of the Federation's editorial and review department. In May 1950, he took the opportunity of celebrating the first anniversary of Hangzhou's liberation to write a "commemorative" article publicizing his "progress" and introducing his past "glorious history." In the article, he said that in the "four or five years before liberation, teaching, reading, writing; participating in youth struggles, fleeing, imprisonment, unemployment, poverty; what thoughts did these lives bring? – 'Icy integrity, heroic writing'"; that "in this year, I recognized the ubiquitous evil of 'individualism'," "recognized the great truth of 'seeking truth from facts'," "recognized Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction of 'learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers'," and "recognized the great significance of 'unity and transformation.'" How beautiful and touching the words were, how sincere and loyal the attitude was, and how "glorious" the past history was, who could not believe that he was a revolutionary? But just a few days before this article was published, that is, when he returned to Hangzhou after secretly talking with the counter-revolutionary ringleader Hu Feng in Beijing, he said to his "intimate friends," "Our cause is bound to be victorious, and my faith will never waver." The victory of their cause was the destruction of the people's revolutionary cause; after the people's revolutionary regime, which was bought with the hard struggle of the people and the blood of tens of thousands of martyrs, was established, they had always hoped for our destruction, hoped for the Kuomintang reactionaries to make a comeback, and hoped that their counter-revolutionary "cause would be victorious." How malicious their intentions were!
    Fang Ran knew that the best way to undermine the Party was to burrow into it. Therefore, he again went through "old connections" and found a corrupt, degenerate, and deteriorated element, Zhou Lixing (whom the Party had not yet discovered at the time), bribing him with a woolen sweater and a Parker fountain pen, and "submitted an application to join the Party at the same time." With such a recommender, Fang Ran finally achieved his goal and burrowed into the Party. At this time, he also tried to burrow into democratic party organizations. In this way, he had the opportunity to contact democratic figures, responsible cadres of the Communist Party, and government leaders. Then, Fang Ran flaunted himself among the masses around him, letting them know that he was a "democratic figure" from the "upper echelons." He constantly spoke to democratic figures in the tone of a Party member, saying "our Party to you democratic figures," in order to gain their respect and admiration. In this way, Fang Ran became a well-rounded figure who could boldly engage in counter-revolutionary activities. When the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries began in 1951 and the People's Government discovered the hidden counter-revolutionaries in "Anhui Middle School," those counter-revolutionaries had special expectations of him, and he was not implicated. As for Fang Ran himself, while writing articles shouting "Long live the people's days," he threw his hidden weapons into the river, and even put on an act of sending workers to brave the cold to dredge the river, trying to deceive the People's Government with these tricks.
    Fang Ran also became familiar with the so-called "laws of the movement." Whenever a political movement began, he would pretend to be sincere and take the lead in conducting "conscious ideological self-examination"; but behind his back, he told his "friends" that "self-criticism, criticism, just slap yourself hard in the face," "bang your head against the wall, the louder the better." He taught others to use the two-faced methods of counter-revolution in this way, telling them to deceive the Party and the People's Government like him. In 1952, he participated in the Five-Anti Campaign. In front of the Party, he said that he had "received a very profound education" in this movement, but behind his back, he said to those comrades who had made mistakes in the Three-Anti Campaign, "Being with the emperor is like being with a tiger," "Why can't you get along with your superiors?" attempting to provoke these people's relationship with the Party and make them forever hate the Party and the People's Government. In the winter of the same year, his master Hu Feng's reactionary theories were criticized, and the critics mentioned the issue of this counter-revolutionary clique. Fang Ran then said to people everywhere: "I have long since stopped engaging in literary work and have already changed careers," attempting to divert everyone's attention with this deceptive trick; but in secret, he spread rumors, saying that "Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' are going to be fundamentally revised," "He Qifang and Lin Mohan's criticism is fundamentally an old problem of sectarian struggle." And he vilified Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," marking with question marks all the places in Chairman Mao's article that talked about "class stand," "the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers," "Party spirit," and "the ideological transformation of writers."
    This cunning, insidious, and malicious counter-revolutionary element, when Hu Feng planned a frenzied attack on the Party last year, immediately responded to Hu Feng's slogan of "attack together," writing a report to Minister Lu Dingyi of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, defending Hu Feng and slandering the Party's literary leadership; at the same time, he offered Hu Feng advice, telling him to "divide the steps of the struggle into two steps: the first step is to fight for 'freedom of creation,' 'freedom of publication,' and 'freedom of debate'; the second step is to strive for the reorganization of publications and publishing institutions," in order to completely abolish the Party's leadership over literary work. At the same time, he actively organized the counter-criticism of criticisms of "There Is No Winter Here," which Hu Feng considered to be a "battle that played a coordinating role," and planned with other Hu Feng elements to open fire on the Party's literary leadership in East China...
    In the past few years, in addition to playing vicious two-faced tricks to deceive the masses, mislead the leadership, and engage in destructive activities, the counter-revolutionary Fang Ran also frequently used the so-called "habit of being hospitable" to invite friends to his home for "dinners," "discussions on literary issues," and "help in solving marriage problems," in order to "find objects," "establish friendships," and expand the organization of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. As soon as he discovered that you had dissatisfied emotions towards the Party, he would immediately give you "comfort and warmth" and "help" you solve your difficulties; when he discovered that you had serious individualistic fame and profit ideas, and were asking him for advice on your articles, he would immediately praise you, saying that your work was "the brilliance of genius"; but when these articles praised by him were submitted to newspapers and periodicals and not published, he would take the opportunity to stir up trouble, saying that "sectarian rule exists in literary leadership"; if your work was criticized by the masses after it was published, he would distort and maliciously quote Lu Xun's words, saying that the critics were "swinging their axes to cut off the heads," "galloping on the land of seedlings," and "attacking new forces," and then introduce Hu Feng's "theories" to you, instilling anti-Party and anti-people poison into you. In this way, many people were unconsciously or consciously dragged into the water step by step, and finally became members of this counter-revolutionary clique. Fang Ran also used the same despicable methods to seduce and coerce some female students and female staff who expressed admiration for him, in order to satisfy his animal desires. These are even more countless things.
    Fang Ran's crimes are of course not limited to these. Even when Hu Feng's reactionary theories were severely criticized nationwide, the conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was gradually exposed, and the people and the Party repeatedly named Fang Ran, he still wanted to continue playing shameless two-faced tricks, writing an article "Criticizing Hu Feng and Simultaneously Examining Myself," and sending it to a leader he had always thought "did not understand literature and art" for review; like other Hu Feng elements, his article completely repeated things that others had already criticized based on the scope prescribed by their master Hu Feng, and played with a few nouns, attempting to deceive the leadership and the masses once again and muddle through. But the people of the whole country will no longer allow them to continue playing deceptive tricks. Under the exposure of the people of the whole country, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique finally revealed its ferocious and ugly original form; no matter how cunning and insidious this counter-revolutionary gang is, it cannot save itself from its doomed fate. In front of the copper walls and iron walls built by the people, they finally fell into the net.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique carried out conspiratorial activities in Zhejiang for a considerable period of time. Counter-revolutionary elements such as Fang Ran and Ji Fang had "sown seeds" here and developed organizations; the ideological influence spread by Hu Feng's reactionary theories was also very deep and wide. Therefore, we must unite around the Party, heighten our vigilance, and fight to the end to completely smash the organization of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and completely eliminate the reactionary ideological influence of Hu Feng.

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    剥去反革命分子方然的伪装
    亦成
    方然，是胡风反革命集团的一个谋士，也是这个集团里长期埋伏在浙江进行反革命活动的骨干分子。如果说像阿垅、冀汸等胡风分子大都是以“文艺工作”为幌子进行反革命活动的；那末最近几年来，方然的反革命活动却主要地是以伪装为“职业革命者”和“社会活动分子”的身份出现的。原因是为了隐蔽在文化界以外，以便“组成散兵线”，从各个方面来破坏革命事业。虽然他有时也写写文章或者借各种讲座、座谈会的机会大事宣传反动思想，为其他胡风分子的反动著作辩护，对党的文艺领导进行恶毒的攻击；但那气焰已不像过去有着国民党反动政权做靠山时那样嚣张，做法也不是那么明目张胆了；而是以“偶然谈谈”或“写点作家研究”之类的东西，借题发挥，含沙射影，正是运用“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的办法进行的。即使有“内行人”看出了他的用心，也叫你“拿他没有办法”。几年来，当这个反革命集团还没有被揭发出来以前，好些天真的青年曾被他的“渊博”所吓倒；好些同志由于缺乏警惕，被他的“积极的，无‘距离’的态度”以及“文质彬彬”的外表迷惑了。现在，让我们剥掉他的伪装，先来看一看他过去的一部分丑恶的历史吧！
    正如胡风反革命集团的其他几个骨干分子一样，方然很早以前就和国民党特务机关有着密切的联系。还在抗日战争爆发以前，他就参加了国民党特务组织“复兴社”。抗日战争爆发之后，他伪装“革命”，混在年青学生中潜入抗日民主圣地延安。像阿垅一样，他在延安只潜伏了几个月，很快地就回到了国民党统治区，并到处宣扬“延安有军阀统治”，因此要“回到自由的天地里来”。就是在这个“自由的天地里”。他忠实地承袭着胡风主编“希望”的传统，创办了“呼吸”，在这里，他发表了“论生存”“文化风貌录”“‘主观’与真实”等反动文章，大事宣传资产阶级主观唯心主义，并张牙舞爪地将矛头指向延安，指向党的文艺领导、和在国民党统治区的党员作家与非党的革命作家，替国民党特务机关提供迫害革命作家的证据和线索。他就是这样在这个“自由的天地里”自由地反共反了六、七年。到抗日战争胜利后不久，当重庆国民党反动派大批逮捕爱国青年时，由于一个小小的误会，把他也逮捕了。那些和他一道被捕的爱国青年有的被枪杀了，有的被送进了集中营；可是方然仅仅在警备司令部里呆了二十天光景，就由他的主子胡风的“担保”，和他那在国民党军事委员会里任高级参议的伯伯——朱镜匀的“活动”，自由地坐飞机飞到了南京。方然在被“关在”重庆警备司令部里的日子中，除做了最无耻、最卑劣的勾当外，还写了一则诬蔑共产党、诬蔑青年学生爱国运动的启事，登在国民党的中央日报上。
    一九四七年，方然回到他的故乡安庆。那时，中国人民解放军已“行将迫近”“这个小城”了，也就是方然感到“万恶的共匪搅动他的故乡”，意识到末日来临，而“纷乱至极”的时候，他“跑反”到了上海，后来又到了杭州。一到杭州，他就立刻得到在国民党反动军队里当过集团军副总司令兼三十九军军长、积极反共反人民反革命的姑父刘尚志的“帮忙”，创办了“安徽中学”，并得到国民党中央青年部部长大特务头子陈雪屏的支持。于是，首恶分子胡风就将反革命分子阿垅、冀汸、罗洛、朱谷怀……安插在这个中学里，建立了他们从事反革命活动的“据点”。第二年，胡风在去香港前，曾亲自到杭州来举行秘密会议，根据新的形势，布置了“新的任务”。接着，他们就积极行动起来了，一面由阿垅和警察局“联系”；一面由方然将一手培植起来的一批胡风分子伪装起来，把他（她）们混在革命青年中间，派往游击区去“参军”。
    这个在解放前由方然“苦心经营”起来的“学校”——“安徽中学”，在一九五一年全国展开大张旗鼓地镇压反革命运动的初期，便暴露了它的反革命的面目。那里面除了董事长是个反动军官外，还有“看管”过叶挺将军的宪兵军官，还有三青团的骨干分子，甚至有在南京解放前夕化装逃至杭州的国民党的骨干分子。向来以“革命作家”自居的方然，办了这样一所所谓“进步”的“中学”，而其中竟隐藏着这样多的反革命分子，这原因难道还需要解释吗？
    那末，像方然这样一个罪恶昭彰的反革命分子，究竟是怎样隐藏下来，钻进了革命人民的内部并窃取了重要职位的呢？原来当全国大陆即将解放，杭州刚刚成为人民的天下之际，远在北京的胡风，便一面写信给胡风分子彭柏山，要彭柏山“找他们去工作”；一边又向全国文艺工作者代表大会筹委会提名方然、冀汸、阿垅等胡风集团的骨干分子为大会代表；并且又通过“旧关系”和混进党内的胡风分子为方然写历史证明材料。胡风既然替方然有计划、有组织地伪造了历史证明材料，又抬高了他的身价，于是，这只凶恶的豺狼也就被打扮成善良的绵羊了。正像胡风在伪装布置妥贴后写信给方然时说的：“既有信证明，那你的事大概就绪了”。反革命分子既已伪装成革命者，胡风也就要他“尽快参加实际工作”，打入到革命队伍中来。但是方然自知是一个满身都是罪恶的反革命分子，要在革命队伍内隐藏下来，并且窃据重要职位来从事破坏活动，并不是容易的事：于是，他便更巧妙地玩起两面派的手法，来欺骗周围的群众，特别是蒙蔽领导。他时而以“教育界的名流”和“老作家”的身份出现；时而以“社会活动分子”的面貌出现，谈话、写文章都连篇累牍地引用马克思列宁主义词句和中外文豪的著作，并痛骂那些“在战斗中”的“妥协”“投降”“变节”“出卖”者，以及“个人主义者”……，处处表示自己是个革命者，以骗取大家对他的重视和信任，这样他便先后窃取了省文联筹委会常务委员、杭州市文协副主席兼秘书长，以及文联编审部部长的职位。在一九五○年五月间，他借庆祝杭州解放一周年的机会，写了一篇宣扬自己的“进步”，并介绍自己过去的“光荣历史”的“纪念”文章。他在文章中说自己在“解放以前，四、五年来，教书、读书、写作；参加青年斗争、亡命、坐牢、失业、穷困；在这些生活里面带来了什么思想呢？——‘冰霜气节，肝胆文章’”；说自己“在这一年中，认识了‘个人主义’这个无孔不入的坏东西”，“认识了‘实事求是’的伟大真理”，“认识了毛主席‘向工农兵学习，为工农兵服务’的光辉指示”，又“认识了‘团结改造’的伟大意义”。话说得多么漂亮动听，态度又装得那样坦白忠诚，而过去的历史又是这样的“光荣”，谁还能不相信他是一个革命者呢？可是就在这篇文章发表的前几天，也就是他和反革命头目胡风在北京密谈后回到杭州时，他对他的“知心朋友”说，
  “我们的事业是一定胜利的，我的信仰是永远不会动摇的。”他们的事业的胜利，就是人民革命事业的毁灭；当用全国人民的艰苦奋斗和成千成万先烈的鲜血换来的人民革命政权建立起来以后，他们一直就希望我们覆灭，希望国民党反动派卷土重来，希望他们的反革命“事业一定胜利”，他们的用心是多么恶毒！
    方然知道，要破坏党，最好的办法就是钻到党内来。于是，他便又通过了“旧关系”，找到了一个腐化堕落、蜕化变质分子周力行（当时党尚未发觉），用毛线衫、派克自来水笔向他进行贿赂，便“同时送上入党申请书”。有了这样的介绍人，方然终于顺利地达到目的，钻到党内来了。在这时候，他又设法钻进了民主党派组织里去。这样，他也就有了和民主人士、和共产党的负责干部以及政府首长接触的机会；然后，方然就在他周围的群众中炫耀自己，使群众知道他是“上层”的“民主人士”。他不断地用“我们党对你们民主人士”的党员的口气和民主人士说话，以取得民主人士对他的尊重和敬仰。就这样，方然成了一个八面玲珑的人物，可以大胆地进行反革命活动了。当一九五一年镇压反革命运动开始，人民政府在“安徽中学”里发现了那批隐藏的反革命分子的时候，由于那些反革命分子对他抱有特殊的希望，竟没有牵连到他。而方然自己呢，一边写文章大叫“人民的日子万岁”，一边却将暗藏的武器投进河里，还装腔作势地派工友冒着严寒到河里去打捞，想用这些花样来欺骗人民政府。
    方然还摸熟了所谓“运动的规律”。每当一个政治运动开始时，他就会装作诚诚恳恳的样子，带头进行“自觉的思想检查”；可是背地里却告诉他的“朋友们”说：“检讨、批评，只要狠狠打自己的耳光就行了”，“对着墙壁撞头，愈响愈好。”他这样地将反革命的两面手法传授给他人，要他们也像他一样的来欺骗党，欺骗人民政府。在一九五二年，他参加了五反运动，在党的面前说自己在这次运动中“受到一次极深刻的教育”，背地里呢，却对那些在三反中犯过错误的同志说“伴君如伴虎”，
  “你怎么和上级的关系搞不好呢？”企图挑拨这些人和党的关系，使他们永远仇恨党和人民政府。在同年的冬天，他的主子胡风的反动理论受到了批判，批评者并且提到了这个反革命集团的问题，方然便到处对人说：“自己早已不搞文艺工作，早已改行了。”企图用这种遮眼法来分散大家的注意；而在暗地里却散播谣言，说“毛主席‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’要作根本修改了”，“何其芳、林默涵的批评根本就是宗派斗争的老问题。”并且把毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”这一光辉的著作加以诬蔑，凡毛主席文章中谈到“阶级立场”“工农兵方向”“党性”“作家思想改造”的地方，他都给打上了问号。
    这个诡计多端，阴险恶毒的反革命分子，在去年胡风策划向党疯狂进攻的时候，便立刻响应胡风“一齐攻上去”的口号，写了个报告给中共中央宣传部陆定一部长，为胡风辩护，并诬蔑党的文艺领导；同时又向胡风献策，叫他“把斗争的步骤分为两步：第一步，要争得‘创作自由’‘出版自由’‘争论自由’；第二步，要争取改组刊物和出版机构。”以便彻底取消党对文艺工作的领导。同时又积极组织了胡风认为“起配合作用的战役”的、关于对“这里没有冬天”的批评的反批评，又和其他胡风分子一道策划向华东地区党的文艺领导开火……。
    几年来，反革命分子方然除了玩弄毒辣的两面手法欺骗群众，蒙蔽领导，进行破坏活动外，还经常运用所谓“好客的习惯”，邀请朋友们到他家里去“聚餐”“谈文艺问题”“帮助解决婚姻对象”，从中“物色对象”，“建立友谊”，以扩大胡风反革命集团的组织。只要他一发现你有对党不满的情绪，他立刻就给你以“安慰和温暖”，“帮助”你解决困难；当他发现了你有严重的个人主义名利思想，而又在拿文章向他请教时，他立刻就会夸奖你一番，说你的作品是“天才的光辉”；但当这些经过他赞扬的文章投到报刊而未被刊用时，他就乘机挑拨，说“文艺领导上存在着宗派统治”；如果你的作品发表后受到了群众的批评，他就歪曲地、别有用心地引鲁迅的话，说批评家们“抡起板斧排头砍去”，“在嫩苗的地上驰马”，“打击新生力量”，然后将胡风的“理论”介绍给你，向你灌输反党、反人民的毒汁。就这样，好些人不自觉地或自觉地被一步步地拖下了水，终于变成了这个反革命集团中的一分子。方然也用同样卑劣的方法来引诱、胁迫一些对他表示敬仰的女学生和女工作人员，来满足自己的兽欲。这更是不胜枚举的事。
    方然的罪恶当然不仅这些。直到胡风的反动理论在全国范围内受到了严厉的批评，胡风反革命集团的阴谋逐步被揭发出来，人民群众和党一再点了方然的名时，他还想继续耍无耻的两面手法，写了一篇“批评胡风兼检讨自己”的文章，送给他一贯认为“不懂文艺的领导”来审查；像其他胡风分子一样，他的文章完全是根据他们的主子胡风所规定的范围，重复着别人已经批评过的东西，把几个名词搬弄了一番，企图再一次欺骗领导和群众，蒙混过关。但是全国人民再也不容许他们继续玩弄欺骗手段了。胡风这个反革命集团在全国人民的揭发下，终于现出了狰狞丑恶的原形；这个反革命黑帮无论怎样奸诈、阴险，也挽救不了灭亡的命运。在人民筑成的铜墙铁壁的前面，他们终于落网了。
    胡风反革命集团在浙江进行阴谋活动的时期相当长，方然、冀汸等反革命分子曾在这里“播下了种子”，发展了组织；胡风反动理论所散播的思想影响也很深很广。因此，我们必须团结在党的周围，提高警惕，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团的组织，彻底肃清胡风反动的思想影响而斗争到底。
