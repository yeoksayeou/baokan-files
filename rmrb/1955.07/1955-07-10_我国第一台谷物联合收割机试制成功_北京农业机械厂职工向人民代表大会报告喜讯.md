Our Country's First Grain Combine Harvester Successfully Trial-Produced
Workers of Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant Report Good News to the People's Congress

Xinhua News Agency: Our country's first domestically-made grain combine harvester has been successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant. This is a major gift from the factory's workers to the farmer brothers in 1955.

This combine harvester is completely copied from the Soviet "Stalin Nets No. 6" combine harvester. It weighs about seven tons and has more than 25,000 parts. It is pulled by a tractor. It can harvest 30 mu of wheat per hour. Judging from harvesting efficiency alone, it is equal to the workload of five rocker-arm harvesters, and the labor productivity is 80 times higher than manual harvesting with a sickle.

During the trial production, workers and technicians, with the help of Soviet experts, overcame a series of difficulties such as low technical level, lack of manufacturing experience, poor equipment, and unavailability of certain materials. Surveying and mapping began on August 21 last year, and all assembly was completed on April 15 this year. Later, according to the opinions of Soviet experts, and in accordance with the trial production appraisal procedures for new products, strict technical inspections, no-load trial runs, and field tests were carried out to examine the performance and manufacturing quality. The appraisal results were good.

On the day of the first field trial harvest, the workers and designers who participated in the trial production came to the wheat field. With excitement and nervousness, they were concerned about the success of the combine harvester they had manufactured themselves. When the green-painted combine harvester started moving in the golden wheat field, applause and cheers rang out from the crowd of onlookers. The combine harvester moved and harvested at the same time, automatically completing threshing, cleaning, and other tasks. The clean wheat grains flowed continuously into the granary. Where it passed, only a patch of short wheat stubble and piles of wheat straw remained on the ground.

Preliminary field tests have proven that the combine harvester has good results. It is currently preparing to participate in the wheat harvest of state-owned farms in Northeast China to test the durability of various parts.

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: All the workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant wrote to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on July 9th, reporting the successful trial production of our country's first grain combine harvester.

The letter said: "While you are discussing and deciding on the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of our national economy, we are reporting to the Congress with great excitement: our country's first grain combine harvester has been successfully manufactured! This is a large-scale agricultural machine pulled by a tractor. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and with the specific guidance of Soviet experts and the assistance of fraternal factories across the country, we overcame difficulties such as the lack of ready-made design drawings, the lack of special equipment, incomplete material varieties, and low technical level. After eleven months of effort, we finally completed the task entrusted by the state."

The letter said: "After reading the report of Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, we know that within five years, the state will build ninety-one new state-owned mechanized farms, and one-third of the farmers across the country will participate in the existing primary forms of agricultural production cooperatives. We feel that this has given us agricultural machinery workers an arduous and glorious task: to manufacture more and various types of agricultural machinery. We guarantee to the Congress that we will never be arrogant or complacent, continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve the level of enterprise management, complete all the tasks assigned by the state, and contribute our own strength to the full realization of the first five-year plan."

### 我国第一台谷物联合收割机试制成功　北京农业机械厂职工向人民代表大会报告喜讯

　　我国第一台谷物联合收割机试制成功
  　北京农业机械厂职工向人民代表大会报告喜讯
    本报讯　我国自制的第一台谷物联合收割机，已经由北京农业机械厂试制成功。这是一九五五年该厂工人对农民兄弟的重大献礼。
    这台联合收割机是完全根据苏联“斯大林湼茨六号”联合收割机仿制的。总重约七吨，共有两万五千多件零件。它由拖拉机牵引。每小时能收割三十亩小麦，单从收割效率来比较，等于五台摇臂收割机的工作量，比人工用镰刀收割的劳动生产率提高八十倍。
    在试制期间，工人和技术人员在苏联专家帮助下，克服了技术水平低、制造经验不足、设备差、某些材料买不到等一系列的困难。从去年八月二十一日开始测绘，到今年四月十五日全部装配完成。以后又依照苏联专家的意见，按新产品试制鉴定程序，通过严格的技术检查，空车试运转及田间试验，考查了性能和制造的质量。鉴定结果良好。
    在首次进行田间试割那天，参加试制的工人和设计人员都来到麦田里，他们怀着兴奋而紧张的心情关心着他们自己制造的联合收割机的成功。当漆着绿色油漆的联合收割机在金黄色的麦田里开动的时候，参观的人群中响起了一片鼓掌声和欢呼声。联合收割机一面走，一面割，同时自动完成了脱粒、清选等工作，洁净的麦粒就源源不绝地流入谷仓。它走过的地方，地上只剩下一片矮矮的麦荏和一垛垛麦秸。
    联合收割机经过初步田间试验，证明效果良好。目前正准备参加东北国营农场的麦收工作，以试验各部件的持久性。
    新华社九日讯　北京农业机械厂全体职工七月九日写信给第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，报告我国第一台谷物联合收割机试制成功。
    信中说：在你们正在讨论和决定我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的时候，我们以万分兴奋的心情向大会报告：我国第一台谷物联合收割机制成功了！这是一台用拖拉机牵引的大型农业机械。我们在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在苏联专家具体指导和全国各地兄弟工厂的协助下，我们克服了没有现成的设计图纸，缺乏专用设备，材料品种不全和技术水平不高等困难，经过十一个月的努力，终于完成了国家委托的任务。
    信中说：我们看到国务院李富春副总理的报告后，知道五年内，国家要新建九十一个国营机械化农场，全国三分之一的农户都要参加现有的初级形式的农业生产合作社。我们感到这就给了我们农业机械工人一个繁重而光荣的任务：制造出更多的、各种类型的农业机械来。我们向大会保证：决不骄傲自满，继续努力学习苏联先进经验，提高企业管理水平，完成国家所交给的一切任务，在全部实现第一个五年计划中贡献出自己的力量。
