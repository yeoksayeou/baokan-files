　  Qingdao Begins Revising Basic Construction Plans
    Some state-owned factories and basic construction units in Qingdao are re-examining their basic construction plans, cutting unnecessary projects to save funds for the country.

    The state-owned Qingdao No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory reviewed fifteen major repair projects under construction and not yet started in 1955. Based on the principle of frugality, it reduced projects that could be done or not, and comprehensively revised the original plan, which can save the country more than 27,800 yuan. The Qingdao Municipal Urban Construction Committee inspected construction projects throughout the city and studied measures to reduce construction costs. For example, the office building planned by the Licun Fruit Production Company was originally designed as a two-story building, but is now planned to be changed to a one-story building, and unnecessary items and area are reduced; in this way, the total construction area is reduced from 664 square meters to 328 square meters, and the cost per square meter is also reduced from 60.84 yuan to 45 yuan. The Municipal Real Estate Administration recently reviewed and revised the original basic construction plan. After revising the plan for only two basic construction projects, the funds saved can build houses with an area of ​​more than 3,600 square meters. Among them, the Yan'an Road dormitory project, which has not yet started, was originally designed as a three-story building with a cost of 65 yuan per square meter and a construction area of ​​more than 4,000 square meters, which could only accommodate 100 households; after being changed to a one-story building, the cost per square meter is only 35 yuan, and the construction area can be increased by more than 2,300 square meters, which can accommodate more than 300 households in total. The Dalian Mountain dormitory project reduced some extravagant and unnecessary items, such as large roofs, various patterns, and built-in wardrobes, and the funds saved can build more than 300 square meters of one-story houses.

　  青岛开始修改基本建设计划
    青岛市部分国营工厂和基本建设单位正重新审查基本建设计划，削减不必要的项目，为国家节约资金。
    国营青岛第二棉纺织厂审查了一九五五年正在施工和尚未施工的十五项大修工程，根据节约原则，把可办可不办的项目削减，并全盘修改了原计划，能给国家节约资金二万七千八百多元。青岛市城市建设委员会对全市建筑工程做了检查，研究了降低建筑成本的措施。如李村果产公司计划建筑的办公室，原设计为二层楼房，现在准备改为平房，并削减不必要的项目和面积；这样，总建筑面积便由六百六十四平方公尺减少到三百二十八平方公尺，每平方公尺的造价也由六十点八四元降低到四十五元。市房地产管理局最近审查和修改了原来的基本建设计划。仅两项基本建设工程经过修改计划，节约的资金就能多建筑面积达三千六百多平方公尺的房屋。其中尚未开工的延安路宿舍工程，原设计是三层楼房，每平方公尺造价是六十五元，建筑面积四千多平方公尺，只能容纳一百家住户；经改为平房以后，每平方公尺造价只有三十五元，建筑面积可增加二千三百多平方公尺，一共能容纳三百多家住户。大连山宿舍工程把一些铺张浪费和可有可无的项目，如大屋顶、各种花纹和屋内壁橱等减去以后，节约的资金能多建筑三百多平方公尺的平房。
