Moving Towards Lasting Peace and Friendly Cooperation
    ——Report on the Situation and Achievements of the Helsinki World Peace Assembly
    Mao Dun, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the World Peace Assembly
    Comrades, honored guests:
    Chairman Guo Moruo has just announced the significance of today's meeting and given us important instructions. Now, please allow me to report to you on the situation and main achievements of the historically significant Helsinki World Peace Assembly.

    (I)
    The Helsinki World Peace Assembly, which concerned peace-loving people all over the world, successfully concluded on June 29, 1955, amidst enthusiastic cheers from all delegates.

    This Peace Assembly was decided upon at the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council in November 1954. As everyone knows, at that time, the aggressive bloc headed by the United States signed the Manila Treaty in the East and the London and Paris Agreements in the West; they expanded military bases all over the world, pieced together military blocs everywhere, and interfered in the internal affairs of other countries; they frantically clamored for atomic warfare and intensified preparations for launching a new war. Therefore, the World Peace Council, an international organization for defending peace, decided, based on the common demands of the world's people for safeguarding peace, to launch a powerful people's movement, calling for "holding a large-scale World Peace Assembly with the participation of representatives of all forces and tendencies striving for peace."

    Counting from the first World Peace Congress in Paris-Prague in 1949, followed by the Warsaw World Peace Congress in 1950 and the Vienna World People's Peace Congress in 1952, the Helsinki Assembly was the fourth World Peace Assembly held.

    The resolution to convene the World Peace Assembly was warmly supported and widely responded to by the people of all countries. Many countries convened national peace assemblies and other forms of peace gatherings, and many representative international organizations and famous social activists issued statements or talks supporting the convening of the assembly. Hundreds of millions of good people all over the world actively launched various activities to welcome this meeting, which was related to human happiness.

    After the people of various countries had carried out extensive and in-depth preparatory work, the World Peace Assembly opened on June 22, 1955, in Helsinki, the beautiful capital of the Republic of Finland.

    Participating in this meeting were 1,841 people from 68 countries. Among them were 1,604 representatives, 109 observers, and 92 special guests. The delegates attending the assembly were all selected from different strata and groups in their respective countries. Among them were workers, peasants, staff members, professors, writers, artists, scientists, members of parliament, former speakers, former ministers, generals, mayors, as well as leaders of various mass organizations and religious figures. Some of them were communists and social democrats, some were Catholics from Rome and Muslims from Arab countries, and there were also Gandhians from India, Buddhist believers from Japan, and pacifists from Northern Europe. It is particularly noteworthy that quite a few people who had previously opposed the peace movement and had prejudices against it, and even those who still had doubts about it, also participated in this meeting. In addition, there were representatives from quite a few influential international organizations who were unwilling to cooperate or had not cooperated with the peace movement in the past. Therefore, from the perspective of the ideological schools and political tendencies represented by the people present, the Helsinki World Peace Assembly can be said to be the most widely representative gathering of peace-loving people in the history of the world.

    The breadth of this meeting can also be seen from the support of many world-renowned public figures for the assembly. Everyone already knows that on the first day of the assembly, Honorary Speaker of the French National Assembly, Herriot, Queen Elizabeth of Belgium, the famous Indian social activist Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, former President of Mexico Cárdenas, and former Prime Minister of Japan Tetsu Katayama, among others, were warmly welcomed for their congratulatory messages to the assembly. In their congratulatory messages, they all expressed their congratulations on the successful convening of the assembly and hoped that the assembly would make effective resolutions to ensure lasting world peace and promote friendly cooperation among the people of all countries. Mr. Herriot's words were very moving. He said: Dear friends, please accept my support, the support of an eighty-three-year-old man whose life is nearing its end. He implores you with all his remaining energy to unite more closely in morality, eliminate the despicable demons, and give peace to the good people of the world. Due to health reasons, he was unable to attend the assembly in person, but he sent the Deputy Mayor of Lyon, France, to represent him, and he accepted the assembly's election of him as the honorary chairman of this assembly.

    The breadth of the assembly enabled the participants—whether delegates or guests—to put forward various different opinions on many important international issues and to compare and study these different opinions. At the same time, the committees of this assembly were held completely openly, and journalists from all countries were able to participate, which was also a new feature of the democratic nature of this assembly. Despite the presentation of different opinions at the assembly, everyone had the same purpose, which was to seek mutual understanding for the benefit of peace. These issues were mainly included in the three central agenda items proposed by Chairman Joliot-Curie, namely: (1) universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons; (2) military blocs and security; (3) national independence and defense of peace. These three issues concentratedly reflect the focus of international situation that the people of the world are concerned about at present. All the representatives, in a completely free and democratic way, adopted the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and conducted eight days of calm, but also warm and sincere, discussions and debates. As a result, a common understanding was reached on all important issues, and the reports and suggestions of the seven committees were produced. And the historically significant World Peace Assembly Declaration was unanimously adopted in a very serious and solemn vote.

    These recommendations include the following issues: (1) demanding universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons; (2) opposing military blocs and demanding the establishment of a collective security system; (3) demanding the restoration of the UN Charter, the restoration of the rights and status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the five major powers striving to seek cooperation; (4) demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Asia and the abolition of all foreign military bases; (5) supporting the principles and propositions of the Bandung Conference and resolving all disputes through negotiations; (6) promoting free cooperation in the cause of striving for peace; (7) demanding an end to the arms race and improving people's living standards; (8) calling for promoting the expansion of cultural and economic development and exchanges; (9) calling on cultural and artistic workers and the people to jointly promote the establishment of an atmosphere of understanding and harmony in the world; (10) striving to improve the lives of young people and opposing the poisoning and destruction of the younger generation, and so on. Comrades, the content included in the declaration and recommendations of this assembly is so rich and so broad that it goes without saying that this is a great achievement of the peace movement. In order to comprehensively realize these recommendations, and to further develop the movement to defend peace, this assembly has reorganized and expanded the World Peace Council. This proves with facts that this meeting has specifically advanced the struggle of the world's people to defend peace.

    On the afternoon of June 29, when the assembly declaration was adopted and Mr. Guo Moruo delivered the closing speech on behalf of the assembly, and the executive chairman officially announced the successful conclusion of the Helsinki World Peace Assembly, one moving scene after another was unforgettable for everyone who participated in the assembly. Everyone in the hall stood up unanimously, applauded enthusiastically, and sang to their heart's content. The representatives cheered "Long live peace! Long live friendship!" in various languages for a long time. Many representatives were moved to tears. At this time, you felt that the Messuhalli Hall, with its glittering mercury lamps, suddenly turned into a world full of joy and friendship, as if the people of the whole world were cheering together. This revelry continued for a long time. This exciting scene can be regarded as the most enthusiastic one we have ever experienced in participating in international gatherings. This symbolizes the brilliant achievements of this World Peace Assembly and the great victory of the spirit of seeking common ground overcoming differences. It once again proves to all countries that in our era, although people's lifestyles and ideological tendencies are different, as long as there is sincerity, on the road to peace, many extremely important and urgent international issues can and must be resolved through consultation today. At the same time, it also warns the warmongers once again: the common will of the peace-loving people of the world cannot be intimidated by any evil forces of war, and the increasingly strong unity of the people of the world is invincible to all enemies of peace.

    (II)
    This World Peace Assembly was convened at an important moment in the development of the international situation and the struggle of the people of all countries to maintain peace.

    From East to West, we see a series of efforts by the bastion of world peace—the great Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries—are converging with the efforts of the people of all countries to form a huge torrent demanding the easing of the international situation. The success of the historic Asian Countries Conference and the epoch-making Asian-African Conference, the signing of the treaty guaranteeing Austria's independence and neutrality, the improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the frequent contacts and mutual visits of government officials of many countries in Asia and Africa during this period, and the high tide of the Japanese people's movement demanding national independence and opposing atomic warfare, the heroic struggles of the people of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Arab countries against colonialism and racial discrimination, the struggle of the European people against the Paris Agreements and the heroic struggle of the Latin American people against aggression and for maintaining sovereignty and independence, all of these demonstrate the great efforts and the obvious achievements made by peace-loving countries and people for the cause of peace and promoting friendly relations with each other. The soldiers defending peace gathered in Helsinki at this important moment, and at this moment once again made new contributions to the cause of world peace. They successfully responded to the ardent expectations of the people of all countries and completed the glorious mission entrusted to them by the people of all countries.

    Dear comrades, let us express our heartfelt congratulations on the great achievements of the aforementioned series of peace undertakings! Let us express our warm respect to the peace-loving governments and people of all countries who have created these achievements.

    At the same time, the Helsinki World Peace Assembly was also held at the time when the tenth anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter was being commemorated in San Francisco, USA, and the summit meeting of the heads of state of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France was about to be held. At the plenary session on June 24, a telegram was passed to the San Francisco meeting, requesting the United Nations to adhere to its purposes and principles, and requesting the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the admission of more countries to the United Nations. Only in this way, it was believed, could the United Nations gain the trust of the people of all countries. Many representatives unanimously hoped in their speeches that the United Nations would wash away its stains, strictly abide by the Charter, and truly play its due role as a peaceful consultation mechanism for countries around the world. Regarding the attitude towards the Four Powers Conference, the Assembly Declaration powerfully pointed out at the beginning: "Due to the efforts of public opinion, the heads of state of the four powers will meet for the first time in a divided world in ten years. They bear a huge responsibility for the expectations of the whole world, and their primary responsibility is to overcome mutual distrust." And it demanded that the Four Powers Conference "must make the United Nations organization of a world nature, the way is to welcome the People's Republic of China into the United Nations." Undoubtedly, the World Peace Assembly placed the greatest expectations on the Four Power Government Summit, which reflected the common aspirations of the people of the world. The Four Power Government Summit has now closed on July 23. The process of the meeting shows that the participants are willing to reach a mutually agreed solution on issues such as European security, disarmament, and the development of contacts between East and West. The instructions given to the foreign ministers by the meeting opened the way for further discussion of peaceful solutions to urgent international problems. This is in line with the spirit of the World Peace Assembly Declaration, but we must point out that the Four Power Government Summit did not give due attention to issues in Asia and the Far East. This completely proves that the cause of defending peace still requires the people of all countries in the world to make further efforts.

    (III)
    A major achievement of the World Peace Assembly was that the entire assembly unanimously put forward realistic and reasonable proposals on the fundamental issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, which would consolidate peace and guarantee security. First of all, the Assembly Declaration pointed out that world opinion has now risen up against the policy of strength, against military blocs, and against the serious danger of the arms race and atomic war. The recommendations of the Committee on Disarmament and Atomic Weapons more specifically proposed: efforts must be made to prohibit atomic weapons, destroy stockpiled atomic weapons, and make atomic energy more widely used for peaceful purposes. To this end, it also suggested convening a conference on disarmament. On this issue, the Soviet government's disarmament proposal of May 10, elucidated by Soviet representative Kornechuk at the meeting, was widely welcomed by the assembly. Many representatives praised the Soviet proposal in their speeches, believing that it was the most thorough, detailed, and feasible proposal among the various disarmament plans that had been put forward. Now it is up to the Western countries, especially the United States, to answer. This is another test of whether they have the sincerity to disarm. As a result of the arms race, the living conditions of the people in many Western countries are getting worse and worse. Therefore, many representatives at the meeting fiercely opposed the "Cold War" policy implemented by Western countries, believing that this was a root cause of the tense situation. A British representative said loudly in a speech: "We don't want atomic bombs! We want bread!" A Japanese song that was also transmitted at the venue expressed the feelings of the broad masses of the people: "Let the atomic bomb roll into the sea! Let the Americans go back to their old home!" The widespread desire of the people of the world to demand universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons has been clearly reflected in the huge signature campaign launched by thousands upon thousands of people in response to the World Peace Council. This movement is still developing in many parts of the world. According to current materials, the signature achievements of many countries are greater than in the past, and the signatories are more widespread. For example, in Japan, which launched the signature campaign the earliest, more than 24 million people have signed. In Indonesia, more than 2 million signatures were collected in the first four months alone. In Syria, the number of signatures has reached more than 600,000, which is one-sixth of its national population. In Italy, the number of signatures is 12 million, accounting for one-quarter of the national population. In the Soviet Union, 123,543,604 people have signed. In China, 400,505,997 people have signed this time. The World Peace Assembly also suggested taking August 6, the day Hiroshima was bombed by an atomic bomb, as the day of worldwide demand for disarmament and the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and action for peace, as proposed by the Asian Countries Conference in April.

    As everyone knows, the way to guarantee the security of all countries is not through the establishment of aggressive military blocs and military base policies, but must recognize and implement peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, and achieve it through the establishment of a collective security system. Many representatives at the meeting exposed and condemned the facts that the aggressive forces headed by the United States pieced together many military blocs and expanded countless military bases around the world, rudely infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of these countries; and unanimously emphasized that Germany must be restored to unity through peaceful means, and it must not be allowed to participate in any military bloc, and it must be guaranteed that it will not revive militarism. The Assembly Declaration pointed out: On the issue of security, the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference show that peaceful cooperation between countries with different systems on the entire continent can be based on the propositions announced by China and India.

    June 28 was the first anniversary of the announcement of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. This day was the seventh day of the Helsinki Conference. When Mr. Kaushambi, the head of Indian Delegation, suggested that the conference should celebrate the anniversary of the Five Principles, all the representatives welcomed the suggestion with thunderous applause. Yes, no matter how much people like Dulles hate and oppose the Five Principles, its influence is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people, and it has developed from Asia to Africa, Europe, and the whole world. As Chairman Bulganin and Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in their joint statement on June 22, 1955: "Wider recognition of these principles can expand the zone of peace, help establish mutual trust between countries, and pave the way for closer international cooperation."

    Dear comrades, here, I should also convey to you the situation of the Assembly supporting the Asian-African Conference. Whether at the plenary session or in the committee, representatives from many countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas praised the historical significance of the Asian-African Conference and its great contribution to the cause of peace in their speeches. The principles and spirit of the Asian-African Conference were universally cited in the Assembly Declaration and the reports and recommendations of the committees. Although some Israeli representatives had some objections to the Asian-African Conference, they finally did not oppose or abstain when passing the declaration. Former Speaker of the Chilean Congress Castro said: "Please allow me to suggest to the Assembly that the Bandung Conference be recognized as also applicable to Latin America, so that these spirits can be included in the struggles of our people until the governments of various countries formally recognize it, making it an effective way to quickly move towards peace." This is not surprising, because many countries in the world are now suffering from the aggression and harm of colonialist countries, especially the United States. Therefore, when Chairman Guo Moruo said at the assembly, "The Asian-African Conference announced that the era when no problem could be solved without the participation of colonial countries has ended. We will see that this era will end forever in all regions of the world," the venue resounded with very warm applause.

    In order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the Far East, the documents of the World Peace Assembly put forward a series of reasonable proposals to solve some of the current pressing problems in the region. That is, return Taiwan to the People's Republic of China; advocate that the countries concerned should strictly abide by the Geneva Agreement on the armistice in Indochina and hold free elections in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia on the scheduled dates; advocate that the countries concerned should convene a conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, so that the Korean people can independently achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea; demand a peaceful settlement of the Indian Goa and Indonesian West Irian issues. All of this is the steps that should be taken to ease international tensions or eliminate the threat of a new war. As Chinese people, we especially welcome with gratitude the documents of the Asia Problem Committee passed by the Assembly and pointed out that "Since Taiwan is irrefutably an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, only the speedy withdrawal of foreign troops stationed on the island can guarantee peace in the region." At the same time, we also thank the people of all countries for their support for the just struggle of our people to liberate Taiwan. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people living in Taiwan are Chinese people. We will never allow others to invade our territory and trample on our people. We must accomplish our sacred mission and resolutely fight to the end to liberate our Taiwan.

    The struggle for national independence and the cause of defending peace are inseparable. This issue was also an important agenda item discussed at this Peace Assembly. The peace movement has always been concerned about and supported the struggles of people in various places to strive for and maintain their sovereignty and oppose foreign colonialist aggression. At this Helsinki Assembly, many representatives accused colonialism, especially American colonialism, of arbitrarily infringing upon the sovereignty of these countries. The document of the National Sovereignty and Peace Committee passed by the World Peace Assembly called on the people of all countries to unite against armed occupation of other countries, interference in internal affairs, division of their territories, and activities that threaten peace and security such as obstructing their free trade. And it announced that all military actions and suppressive measures against colonial peoples who demand peace, independence, and freedom—especially in Africa and Asia—should be stopped immediately, foreign military bases established in these countries should be abolished, and any racial discrimination, such as racial discrimination in South Africa, should be eliminated.

    (IV)

    Dear comrades, the voice of the world's people is strong, the power of the unity of the world's people is invincible, and the resolutions of the Helsinki Assembly can and must be strived for! Everyone knows that in 1952, the representatives of the people in Vienna called for an end to the existing war, and the Korean War finally stopped. In 1953, the representatives of the people again called in Budapest for the settlement of disputes through consultation, and soon the Geneva Conference signed the Indochina Armistice Agreement. Everyone also knows that in 1950, the World Peace Council launched a worldwide signature campaign to ban the use of atomic weapons based on the will of the people, and the atomic maniacs finally did not dare to commit crimes. In recent years, the peace forces have continued to call for holding big power conferences, and now they have begun to be initially realized. This series of victories shows that as long as the people of all countries unite, strive for peace, and launch strong public opinion to cooperate, then the demand for peace can be realized. However, when we celebrate our achievements, there should be no slackening or pride, because the enemies of peace have not abandoned the policies of war and aggression. While being forced to agree to consultation and forced to shout for peace, the American aggressive bloc is intensifying preparations for war and conducting provocations. They are still taking various measures to obstruct the world's people from realizing their desire for peace in order to continue to maintain a tense situation. Therefore, peace-loving people must continue to heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, and fight against the new conspiracies of warmongers.

    Our Chinese delegation to this Peace Assembly was composed of forty-five representatives from all walks of life. The delegation completed the entrustment of the people of the whole country. Through the speeches of the delegation members at the assembly and in the committees, and through the gatherings and contacts with representatives from various countries outside the meeting, they expressed the sincere desire and firm will of our people to unite international friends and safeguard the cause of peace. Our opinions were warmly welcomed and praised by peace representatives from all countries.

    Our Chinese people have always cherished peace and actively fought for peace. We warmly welcome and support the declaration and various recommendations passed by this World Peace Assembly, and we are willing to strengthen unity with all good people in the world and strive to achieve the goals set in these documents. As Chairman Guo Moruo said in his closing speech at the Helsinki Assembly: "The Chinese people will prove with more facts in the future that the Chinese people will always be loyal friends of peace." The Chinese people, full of confidence in their own cause and in the common cause of the people of the world, firmly believe that as long as the people of all countries continue to unite, overcome difficulties, and cooperate more closely, we will continue to win one victory after another in the struggle to defeat the enemies of peace! Comrades, let us work harder to accelerate work, complete and overfulfill the great First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and use new achievements on various work fronts to create conditions for further easing the international situation and defending world peace, and continue to contribute our strength! Let us better unite international friends, and together with the people of the world, resolutely eliminate the threat of a new war and move towards lasting peace and friendly cooperation!

    向持久和平和友好合作的道路前进
    ——关于赫尔辛基世界和平大会的情况和成就的报告
    中国出席世界和平大会代表团团长　茅盾各位同志、各位来宾：
    刚才郭沫若主席宣布了今天开会的意义，并给了我们重要的指示。现在请让我将这次有历史意义的赫尔辛基世界和平大会的情况和主要成就向诸位作一次传达。
      （一）
    全世界爱好和平的人们所关切的赫尔辛基世界和平大会，于一九五五年六月二十九日在全体代表热烈的欢呼声中胜利闭幕了。
    这次和平大会是一九五四年十一月世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议所决议召开的。大家知道：那时，以美国为首的侵略集团在东方签订了马尼拉条约之后，又在西方签订了伦敦和巴黎协定；他们在世界各地扩建军事基地，到处拼凑军事集团和干涉他国内政；疯狂叫嚣原子战争，加紧发动新战争的准备。因此保卫和平的国际组织——世界和平理事会根据世界人民维护和平的共同要求，决定发动一个强大的人民运动，号召“举行一次有争取和平的一切力量和各种倾向的代表参加的、规模巨大的世界和平大会。”
    从一九四九年巴黎—布拉格第一届保卫世界和平大会算起，继一九五○年的华沙保卫世界和平大会和一九五二年的维也纳世界人民和平大会之后，这次赫尔辛基大会就是第四次举行的世界和平大会。
    召开世界和平大会这一决议，获得了各国人民的热烈拥护和广泛响应。许多国家召开了全国和平大会和其他各种形式的和平集会，许多有代表性的国际组织和著名的社会活动家，都发表了支持召开大会的声明或谈话。全世界千百万善良的人们都积极展开了各种活动，来迎接这个关系着人类幸福的会议。
    在各国人民进行了广泛而深入的准备工作以后，世界和平大会于一九五五年六月二十二日在芬兰共和国美丽的首都赫尔辛基开幕了。
    参加这次会议的，有来自六十八个国家的一千八百四十一人。其中代表一千六百零四人，观察员
  一百零九人，特邀来宾九十二人。出席大会的代表们都是从各国的不同阶层和团体中选派来的。他们中间有工人、农民、职员、教授、作家、艺术家、科学家、国会议员、前议长、前部长、将军、市长以及各种群众组织的领袖和宗教界人士等。他们有的是共产党人和社会民主党人，有的是来自罗马的天主教徒和来自阿拉伯国家的回教徒，也有印度的甘地主义者，日本的佛教信徒和北欧的和平主义者。值得特别注意的是，有好些曾经反对过和平运动和对和平运动有过成见的、甚至现在还对它抱着怀疑的人，也参加了这次的会议。此外，还来了好些过去不愿和和平运动合作或没有合作的有影响的国际组织的代表。因此，从这次到会的人所代表的思想派别和政治倾向上来看，赫尔辛基世界和平大会可以说是历史上第一次代表性最广泛的世界和平人民的集会。
    这次会议的广泛性也可以从许多世界各国著名的公众领袖对大会的支持看出来，大家都已知道，大会第一天热烈欢迎了法国国民议会名誉议长赫里欧，比利时王后伊丽莎白，印度著名社会活动家拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人，墨西哥前总统卡德纳斯以及日本前首相片山哲等人给大会的贺信。他们都在贺信中表示祝贺大会的成功召开，并希望大会对保证持久的世界和平和促进各国人民的友好合作，作出有效的决议。赫里欧先生的话是非常感动人的，他说：亲爱的朋友，请接受我的支持，一个风烛残年的八十三岁的老人的支持。他将全部剩余的精力恳求您们，在道义上更紧密地团结起来，消灭卑鄙的恶魔，给世界善良的人以和平。他因健康关系未能亲自出席大会，但他派了法国里昂市副市长代表他参加，他并接受了大会选举他为这次大会的名誉主席。
    大会的广泛性，使得参加会议的人——不论是代表或来宾——都能够在许多重要国际问题上，提出各种不同的意见并对这些不同意见进行比较和研究。同时这次大会的小组委员会是完全公开举行的，所有各国记者都能参加，这也是这次大会的民主方式的一个新的特色。尽管在大会上有不同意见的提出，但大家都有一个相同的目的，就是都是为了和平的利益而求得互相谅解。这些问题，主要的都包括在约里奥—居里主席提出的三个中心议程上，就是：（一）普遍裁军和禁止原子武器；（二）军事集团和安全；（三）民族独立和保卫和平。这三个问题集中地反映了当前世界人民所关心的国际局势的焦点。全体代表围绕着这些议题以完全自由和民主的办法，采取了求同存异的精神，进行了八天的平心静气，也是热烈诚恳的讨论和辩论，结果，在全部重要问题上，都取得了共同的认识，产生了七个小组委员会的各项报告和建议。并以十分认真和隆重的投票方式一致通过了有历史意义的世界和平大会宣言。
    这些建议包括下列问题：（一）要求普遍裁军和禁止原子武器；（二）反对军事集团和要求建立集体安全体系；（三）要求恢复联合国宪章，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利与地位以及五大国努力寻求合作；（四）要求从亚洲撤退一切外国军队和取消外国的一切军事基地；（五）支持万隆会议的原则和主张，通过谈判来解决一切争端；（六）促进在争取和平方面自由地进行合作；（七）要求终止军备竞赛和提高人民生活水平；（八）号召促进扩大文化和经济的发展和交流；（九）号召文化和艺术工作者和人民一起来促进在世界建立了解，和睦的气氛；（十）争取改善青年生活，反对毒害和摧残青年一代等等。同志们，这次大会的宣言和建议所包括的内容是这样丰富这样广泛，不用说这是和平运动的一次巨大成就。为了能够全面地实现这些建议，为了更进一步展开保卫和平的运动，这次大会已将世界和平理事会加以改组扩大了。这就以事实证明本次会议已具体地把世界人民保卫和平的斗争推进了一步。
    六月二十九日下午通过了大会宣言以及当郭沫若先生代表大会致完闭幕词，执行主席正式宣布赫尔辛基世界和平大会胜利闭幕的时候，一个接着一个的热烈动人的场面是我们参加大会的每一个人永远难忘的。全场的人一致起立，一致热烈鼓掌，尽情歌唱，代表们用各种语言长久地齐声欢呼“和平万岁！友谊万岁！”许多代表感动得流下眼泪来。这时，使你觉得那座水银灯光辉煌的麦斯哈里大厅，
  一下变成了一个充满欢乐和友爱的世界，好像是全世界人民一同在欢呼。这种狂欢继续了很久。这样激动人心的情景，可算是我们参加国际集会所经历的最热烈的一次了。这是象征着这次世界和平大会的光辉成就，象征着求同精神克服分歧的重大胜利。它再一次向一切国家证明，在我们这个时代，尽管人们的生活方式和思想倾向不同，但只要有诚意，在和平的道路上，许多极其重要和迫切的国际问题，在今天都可以而且也必须通过协商来达成协议的。同时，它也再一次警告那些战争煽动者们：全世界人民爱好和平的共同意志是任何战争恶势力所吓不倒的，全世界人民愈来愈坚强的团结是一切和平敌人所不可战胜的。（二）
    这次世界和平大会是在国际局势和各国人民维护和平的斗争发展到重要的时刻召开的。
    从东方到西方，我们看到世界和平的堡垒——伟大的苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的一系列的努力，正同世界各国人民的努力汇合，形成了目前要求缓和国际局势的巨大洪流。有历史性的亚洲国家会议和划时代的亚非会议的成功，保证奥地利独立和中立的条约的签订，苏南关系的改善，亚洲和非洲许多国家政府要人在这个时期内的频繁接触和互相访问，以及日本人民要求民族独立、反对原子战争运动的高涨，中近东、北非和阿拉伯人民的反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视的英勇斗争，欧洲人民反对巴黎协定和拉丁美洲人民反对侵略、维护主权和独立的英勇斗争，凡此一切，都表明了爱好和平的国家和人民，为和平事业和促进彼此友好关系所作的巨大的努力和已经取得的明显的成就。保卫和平的战士们，就在这个重要的时刻聚会在赫尔辛基，就在这个时刻再一次为世界和平事业作出新的贡献。他们圆满地回答了各国人民对他们的热烈期望，完成了各国人民付给他们的光荣使命。
    亲爱的同志们，让我们对上述的一连串的和平事业的伟大成就表示衷心的庆贺！让我们向创造这些成就的爱好和平的各国政府和人民表示热烈的敬意。
    同时，赫尔辛基世界和平大会又是正当联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会在美国旧金山进行，和美、苏、英、法四国首脑会议即将召开的时候举行的。在六月二十四日的全体会议上，通过了一个致旧金山会议的电报，要求联合国恪守它的宗旨和原则，并要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位和接纳更多的国家加入联合国。认为只有这样，联合国才能获得各国人民的信任。许多代表在发言中都一致希望联合国洗掉它的污点，严守宪章，真正发挥它的作为世界各国和平协商机构的应有作用。关于对四大国会议的态度，大会宣言一开头就有力地指出：“由于舆论界的努力，十年来四大国首脑将第一次在一个分裂的世界上进行会晤。他们对全世界的期望负有巨大的责任，他们的首要职责是克服相互间的不信任。”并且要求四大国会议“必须使联合国组织具有世界性质，办法就是欢迎中华人民共和国进入联合国。”无疑的，世界和平大会对四国政府首脑会议寄以最大期望，是反映了全世界人民的共同愿望的。现在四国政府首脑会议已于七月二十三日闭幕了，会议的经过表明：与会者都愿望在欧洲安全、裁军以及发展东西方之间的接触等问题上，达成一个一致同意的解决办法。会议给外长们的指示，为进一步讨论和平解决迫切的国际问题打开了道路。这是符合于世界和平大会宣言的精神的，但我们必须指出，四国政府首脑会议对于亚洲和远东问题，没有予以应有的注意，这就完全证明保卫和平的事业还须得世界各国人民作更进一步的努力的。

    世界和平大会的一项重大成就，就是大会全体一致对裁军和禁止原子武器这个巩固和平和保障安全的根本问题，提出了现实合理的主张。首先，大会宣言指出：世界舆论现在已奋起反对实力政策、反对军事集团、反对军备竞赛和原子战争的严重危险。裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会的建议更具体提出：必须争取禁止原子武器，销毁储存的原子武器，使原子能更广泛地为和平服务。为此，并建议召开一个关于裁减军备的会议。在这个问题上，苏联代表考涅楚克在会上所阐明的苏联政府五月十日的裁军建议，受到了大会的普遍欢迎。许多代表在发言中都称赞苏联的建议，认为这是已经提出的多种裁军方案中最周密详尽和切实可行的方案。现在就等西方国家，特别是美国的回答了，这是又一次对他们是否有诚意裁军的一个考验。军备竞赛的结果，使得许多西方国家的人民生活情况愈来愈恶化，因此，许多代表在会上激烈地反对西方国家所执行的“冷战”政策，认为这是紧张局势的一个根源。一个英国代表在发言时大声说：“我们不要原子弹！我们要面包！”会场上所传出的一首日本歌，也表达到了广大人民的情绪“让原子弹滚下海去！让美国人回到他的老家去！”全世界人民要求普遍裁军和禁止原子武器的广泛愿望，已清楚地反映在千千万万人民为响应世界和平理事会所发动的规模巨大的签名运动上。这个运动还正在世界许多地方发展着。就目前的材料看，许多国家的签名成绩都比过去更大，签名的人更广泛。如发动签名最早的日本，已有二千四百多万人签名，印度尼西亚仅仅在头四个月就收集了二百多万个签名，又如叙利亚的签名人数已达到它的全国人口六分之一的六十多万人，意大利的签名人数有一千二百万人，占全国人口四分之一，苏联签名的有一亿二千三百五十四万三千六百零四人。我们中国这次签名的是四亿零五十万五千九百九十七人。世界和平大会还建议，把四月间亚洲国家会议的决议提出过的，以八月六日广岛遭受原子弹轰炸日作为全世界要求裁军和完全禁止原子武器和为和平而行动的日子。
    大家知道，保障各国安全的道路，不是通过建立侵略的军事集团和军事基地政策，而是必须承认和实行不同制度国家间的和平共处，通过建立集体安全体系来达到的。许多代表在会上揭露和谴责了以美国为首的侵略势力在世界各地拼凑建立的许多军事集团和在世界各地扩建的无数军事基地，粗暴地侵犯了这些国家的独立和主权的事实；并一致强调指出必须通过和平的道路使德国恢复统一，不能让它参加任何军事集团，保证它不复活军国主义。大会宣言指出：在安全问题上，万隆会议通过的原则表明，在整个大陆上不同制度的国家之间的和平合作，能够以中国和印度所宣布的主张为基础。
    六月二十八日，是我国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁宣布和平共处五项原则的一周年，这天正是赫尔辛基大会进行的第七天。印度代表团团长高善必在会上提出建议，大会应为五项原则宣布一周年表示庆贺时，全场代表以雷动的掌声欢迎这一建议。是的，不管杜勒斯之流的人物如何痛恨和反对五项原则，但它的影响正日益深入人心，已从亚洲发展到非洲、欧洲，发展到全世界。正如布尔加宁主席和尼赫鲁总理在一九五五年六月二十二日的联合声明中所指出：“这些原则得到更广泛的承认可以扩大和平地区，有助于树立各国之间的相互信任，并为更紧密的国际合作铺平道路。”
    亲爱的同志们，在这里，我还应该向你们传达大会拥护亚非会议的情形。不论是在全体大会上，或是小组委员会上，亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美洲，许许多多国家的代表都在他们的发言中称赞亚非会议的历史意义和它对和平事业的巨大贡献。亚非会议的原则和精神，被大会宣言和各小组委员会的报告和建议所普遍引用。虽然有些以色列代表曾对亚非会议有若干异议，但最后在通过宣言时并未反对也未弃权。智利前议长卡斯特罗说：“请允许我向大会建议，把万隆会议认作也适用于拉丁美洲，使这些精神列入我们各国人民的斗争中，一直到使各国政府正式承认为止，使它成为一条迅速进向和平的有效途径。”这是并不奇怪的，因为现在世界上许多国家都正遭受殖民主义国家特别是美国的侵略和危害。所以当郭沫若主席在大会上说出“亚非会议宣布这样的时代——没有殖民国家参加就不能解决任何问题的时代已经结束了。我们将要看到这样的时代在世界各个地区都将要永远结束。”这段话时，会场上响起了非常热烈的掌声。
    为了保障亚洲和远东的和平和安全，世界和平大会的文件提出了一系列的解决这个地区目前存在的一些迫切问题的合理主张。这就是，把台湾归还中华人民共和国；主张有关国家应严格遵守关于印度支那停战的日内瓦协定，按照规定日期在越南、老挝和柬埔寨举行自由选举；主张有关国家召开关于和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，让朝鲜人民自主地得到朝鲜的和平统一；要求和平解决印度果阿和印度尼西亚的西伊里安问题。所有这一切都是缓和国际紧张局势或消除新战争威胁所应采取的步骤。作为中国人，我们特别以感谢的心情欢迎大会所通过的亚洲问题小组委员会的文件和所指出的“台湾既然不可辩驳地是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，只有尽速撤退驻扎在该岛的外国军队，才能保证这一地区的和平。”同时，我们也感谢各国人民对我国人民解放台湾的正义斗争的支持。台湾是中国的领土，生活在台湾的人民是中国人民，我们决不容许别人侵占我们的领土，蹂躏我们的人民，我们一定要完成我们神圣的使命，坚决为解放我们的台湾而斗争到底。
    争取民族独立的斗争和保卫和平的事业是分不开的。这个问题也是这次和平大会所讨论的一个重要议程。和平运动一向是关心和支持各地人民为争取和维护自己的主权、反对外来殖民主义侵略所进行的斗争的。在这次赫尔辛基大会上，许多代表控诉了殖民主义，特别是美国殖民主义横暴地侵犯这些国家的主权的行动。世界和平大会所通过的民族主权和和平问题委员会的文件，号召各国人民团结起来，反对对其他国家进行武装占领，干涉内政、分裂其领土及以阻挠其自由贸易等威胁和平和安全的活动。并宣布，应该立即停止对要求和平、独立和自由的殖民地人民——特别在非洲和亚洲——所施行的一切军事行动和镇压措施，取消在这些国家所建立的外国军事基地，消除任何种族歧视，如在南非洲的种族歧视。
    （四）
    亲爱的同志们，世界人民的呼声是强有力的，世界人民团结的力量是不可战胜的，赫尔辛基大会的决议是能够和必须争取实现的！大家都知道，一九五二年，人民的代表在维也纳呼吁停止现有战争，朝鲜战争终于停下来了。一九五三年人民的代表又在布达佩斯呼吁用协商解决争端，不久日内瓦会议签订了印度支那停战协定。大家也知道，一九五○年世界和平理事会根据人民的意志发动了全世界规模的禁止使用原子武器的签名运动，原子狂人们终于未敢犯罪。几年来，和平力量不断呼吁举行大国会议，现在也开始初步实现了。这一连串的胜利事实说明，只要各国人民团结起来，努力争取和平并发动强大的公众舆论来配合，那末，和平的要求是能够实现的。但是，当我们庆贺我们的成就时，不应该有丝毫的松懈和骄傲，因为和平敌人并未放弃战争和侵略的政策。美国侵略集团一面被迫赞同协商，被迫也来喊和平，但另一面却加紧准备战争和进行挑衅，他们仍然采取各种手段来阻挠世界人民实现和平的愿望，以便继续维持紧张局势。因此，爱好和平的人民必须继续提高警惕，加强团结，和战争挑拨者新的阴谋作斗争。
    我们中国人民参加这次和平大会的代表团是由四十五位各方面的代表人物组成的。代表团完成了全国人民对我们的委托，代表团各成员通过大会和各小组委员会的发言，通过在会外和各国代表的联欢和接触，表达了我国人民团结国际友人和维护和平事业的诚恳愿望和坚决意志。我们的意见，受到了各国和平代表的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    我们中国人民是一向珍爱和平并积极为争取和平而斗争的。我们热烈欢迎和支持这次世界和平大会所通过的宣言和各项建议，并愿和世界上一切善良的人们加强团结，为实现这些文件所规定的目标而努力。正如郭沫若主席在赫尔辛基大会的闭幕词中所说的：“中国人民今后将以更多的事实证明：中国人民永远是和平的忠实朋友。”对于自己的事业和对于全世界人民共同事业充满信心的中国人民坚决认为，只要各国人民继续团结一致、克服困难和更密切合作，我们将不断在击败和平敌人的斗争中获得一次大过一次的胜利！同志们，让我们更努力地加紧工作，完成和超额完成伟大的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，用各个工作战线上的新的成就来为进一步缓和国际局势和保卫世界和平创造条件，继续贡献我们的力量！让我们更好地团结国际友人，和世界人民一起，坚决消除新战争威胁，向持久和平和友好合作的道路前进！
