Two Female Companions
By Our Staff Reporter Shen Shi

Twenty-four-year-old Liu Jingkuan is the captain of the Electrical Prospecting Team of the Xinjiang Petroleum Company. Compared to when she left school a year ago, she is much more experienced now. Indeed, being the captain of a prospecting team is different from being a student. In school, classes, academic progress, and field practice were all well arranged for you. But as an administrative leader, it's different. This team has more than seventy people, including workers, engineers, and interns… Among the workers, there are Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, and Han. What are their relationships like? Are the customs and habits of each ethnic group respected? You have to care about their work and life, and be responsible for everyone. When it comes to business, there are even more things. What is the progress of electrical surveying? What is the quality? Can the monthly plan be completed? Big and small problems often get into her head.

Liu Jingkuan's classmate, Niu Jiabi, is an intern engineer on this team. She is also the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. During the day, she goes to the field to take measurements, and when she returns to the team headquarters in the evening, big and small things follow. She never seems to finish her work. She is just as busy as her captain!

When the young female captain was studying at the Physical Mining Specialty Department of the Beijing Institute of Geology, she had dreamed of stepping out of the school gate and joining the ranks of the prospecting team, carrying a backpack and tools, searching for iron ore in the undulating mountains. She also dreamed of a team of people in that desolate place, living in tents, eating dry rations, and enduring rain and sun for years, but finally finding a copper mine of great mining value, and she was among the prospecting team members who found this copper mine. How happy that would be!

When she finished her studies and was waiting to be assigned a job, someone asked her: "Liu Jingkuan! Where are you planning to go?"

"I will follow the organization's assignment."

"Looking at your body, can you handle the outdoor life? Why not stay at the Ministry of Geology!"

"I'm young, how can I not handle the outdoor life? I'd rather go to the construction site for training!"

Later, she heard that she was going to Xinjiang, and she also knew that Niu Jiabi would be going with her. She remembered meeting Niu Jiabi for the first time at the Northeast Institute of Geology in Changchun. At that time, Liu Jingkuan was introduced there by the Cultural Department of the South China Military Region to study. One day, after listening to a report, she walked out of the auditorium and heard someone saying behind her: "Look! A soldier of the People's Liberation Army! Our classmate!" A group of girls gathered around her and asked her this and that. Among them was a round-faced girl with two small braids, speaking with an Anhui accent. That was Niu Jiabi. That's how they met. After staying in Changchun for a year, they transferred to Beijing, and now they were going to Xinjiang together.

When they were about to leave Beijing, Liu Jingkuan asked her companion: "Niu Jiabi! What do you think about going to Xinjiang?"

"For those who do geophysical prospecting, it's all the same everywhere!"

"I heard that the weather in Xinjiang is cold and there is a lot of wind and sand. How is your health?"

"I'll get used to it soon."

Although she said that, she still felt a little uneasy. "Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes are always wet with tears." When would they be able to return to the mainland from that remote place? But when they thought of the country's expectations for them, and the rich treasures of Xinjiang waiting for them to explore, a sense of responsibility and affection for their work calmed them down.

When they arrived at the original Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in Urumqi, they were assigned to intern in an electrical prospecting team. The captain and engineers of this team were Soviet comrades. They were also in the same car for field practice. The Soviet expert Sergei Andreevich Ivanov taught them how to operate the equipment. When they opened the circuit diagram of the electrical measuring instrument, it was all in Russian. What to do if they didn't understand Russian? Liu Jingkuan took out a dictionary to look up the words. Sergei Andreevich saw this and said seriously: "Are you not interested in the operation?"

"We are interested."

"Since you are interested, why don't you pay attention to my operation? Is there any difficulty?"

"We don't understand Russian."

"It doesn't matter. Many comrades who don't understand Russian have learned various operations. If you don't understand, just ask!"

The summer sun shone arrogantly on the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The roof of the car was scorching hot, and the generator in the car roared. When measuring electricity, the car doors and windows were all closed, making the car stuffy and hot. Sergei Andreevich was very fat, and his clothes were often soaked with sweat. Originally, he could get out of the car to rest for a while after measuring a certain distance, but he didn't. He was teaching the two new interns. If they didn't understand it once, he would do it again. With his patient help, the girls became proficient in the operation after three months.

In October 1954, China and the Soviet Union issued a joint communique, and the Soviet Union transferred the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company to China. Subsequently, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company was renamed Xinjiang Petroleum Company, and the company decided to appoint Liu Jingkuan as the captain of the electrical prospecting team. When she heard this, she was stunned for a while: "How can you appoint me as the captain? I have no experience at all." She went to see Yu Ping, the director of the Geological Survey Department of the company. Yu Ping encouraged her to have confidence, to get close to the masses, and to give play to everyone's strength. At the same time, she told her that the Soviet experts would not leave immediately, and she could ask the experts if she didn't understand anything.

After talking with Yu Ping, her confidence increased. At the beginning of her administrative leadership work, everything was very unfamiliar, and she was not good at directing others. There was no other way, she had to do everything herself, filling out requisition slips, going to the base to collect materials, negotiating with the transportation department for vehicles... She took care of everything, big and small, making her busy and chaotic, while some people in the team had nothing to do.

Communist Youth League member Gao Chongjiu said to her: "Captain! This won't work. If there is anything, you can tell us to do it." Niu Jiabi also said: "You should learn to arrange work and don't have to take everything on yourself." Niu Jiabi also talked to the Communist Youth League members in the team, telling them that doing a good job in the team was the responsibility of every Communist Youth League member. The members all started to move. There were many temporary workers in the team, and some were not at ease with their work. Liu Jingkuan often approached them, talked to them, and connected their personal interests with the interests of the country, clearing their minds, and they also became active. After a few months, the team's work was on track, and Liu Jingkuan was no longer as timid and chaotic as she was at the beginning.

In the early morning, workers and engineers filled the water tanks, had breakfast, brought a few steamed buns, and got into the car to go to the field electrical measuring station. Niu Jiabi and engineer Liu Shoukui were in two cars, respectively, directing field electrical measurements. Liu Jingkuan sometimes went to the construction site with them, and sometimes stayed at the team headquarters to arrange the work of the entire team. They only returned from the construction site in the evening or late at night. Every time they came back, their necks, eyebrows, and clothes were covered with dust.

Although their work was intense, their burdens were heavy, and their outdoor life was difficult, they were in a very happy mood. They knew deeply that the Party was supporting them, the people of the whole country were concerned about them, and their work was to find oil for the motherland. Oil, people call it "black gold", the planes flying in the sky, the ships sailing in the ocean, and the cars running on the roads, all need oil! "Prospecting team members! Find more oil fields for the motherland!" "The sea robbers are intercepting oil tankers, prospecting oil people! Use your actions to smash the enemy's blockade!" Whenever they thought of these things, it seemed that thousands of eyes were watching them, and thousands of hearts were expecting them. How could the young girls not strive forward?

She remembered that last winter, the prospecting team members returned to Urumqi from the field. Several teams gathered the materials and studied them together, confirming that the area they had surveyed was a promising oil-bearing structure. The girls had indescribable joy.

They had imagined that Xinjiang was a barren and cold place, but when they arrived here, in the place where they were prospecting, they could see the golden wheat waves rippling in the breeze in the large wheat fields in the distance. They could see the endless green of the cotton fields, dotted with purple-red flowers. The snow water flowing from the Tianshan Mountains, which are covered with white snow all year round, irrigates thousands of hectares of fertile land. In this unshielded wilderness, not far away, there are crisscrossing "roads" rolled out by car wheels. How can so many roads not be exciting! In the past, it was only a place for the Mongolian and Kazakh people to graze, but today the horn of socialist construction is being blown.

    两个女伴
    本报记者　沈石
    二十四岁的姑娘刘敬宽，是新疆石油公司电法勘测队的队长。比起一年前离开学校的时候来，她现在要老练得多了。的确，担任一个勘测队的队长，不比当学生。在学校里，上课哪！学业进度哪！野外实习哪！都有人给安排得好好的。可是做了行政领导人，那就不同了。这个队，七十多人，有工人、工程师、实习生……工人当中，有维吾尔族、哈萨克族、回族，还有汉族，他们之间的关系怎样？各族的风俗习惯是不是受到尊重？他们的工作和生活，你都得关心，都得对每个人负责任。谈到业务，事情更多，电测进度怎样？质量怎样？能不能完成每月的计划？大大小小的问题，经常钻进她的脑子里。
    刘敬宽的同学牛家璧，是这个队的实习工程师。她又是青年团的支部书记。她白天到野外测量，晚上回到队部，大小事情也跟着来了，每天的事情老是做不完。她也像她的队长一样，够忙的哩！
    年轻的女队长在北京地质学院物理采矿专修科的时候，她曾幻想过跨出学校大门，参加到勘测队的行列里，背着背囊，带着工具，在那起伏的丛山中寻找铁矿。她也曾幻想过在那荒无人烟的地方，有一队人，住帐篷，吃干粮，积年累月地忍受雨淋日晒，但他们终于找着了极有开采价值的铜矿，而找着这个铜矿的勘测队员里，有她，那是多么的愉快！
    当她学业结束等待分配工作的时候，有人问她：“刘敬宽！你准备到什么地方去？”
    “听从组织分配。”
    “看你这样的身体，野外生活吃得消吗？还是留在地质部吧！”
    “年纪轻轻的，野外生活怎样吃不消，我愿意到工地去锻炼比较好些！”
    后来听说要到新疆去，并且知道和她一道的，还有牛家璧。她记得同牛家璧第一次见面，是在长春的东北地质学院。那时候，刘敬宽由华南军区文化部介绍到那儿学习。一天，刚听完报告，从礼堂走出来，只听得后面有人在说：“看！解放军！我们的同学！”一群姑娘不约而同地围拢过来，向她问这问那，其中有一位圆圆的脸，扎着两根小辫，说起话来夹杂着安徽口音，那就是牛家璧。这样她俩便认识了。在长春待了一年，她们转院到北京，现在又要一道上新疆了。
    在北京快要出发的时候，刘敬宽问她的同伴说：“牛家璧！你上新疆去觉得怎么样？”
    “搞物理探矿的，反正哪里都是一样！”
    “听说新疆天气冷，风沙多，你身体怎样？”
    “不多久便会过惯的。”
    话虽这样说，心里还是有些不安。“一出嘉峪关，两眼泪不干”。到那遥远的地方，什么时候能回内地一趟呢？但当她们想到国家对自己的期望，想到新疆富饶的宝藏等待她们去勘探，一种责任感和对工作的感情使她们安下心来。
    到了乌鲁木齐的原中苏石油公司，她俩被派在一个电法勘测队里实习。这个队的队长和工程师都是苏联同志。野外实习她们又同在一辆车上。苏联专家谢尔盖·安德烈维奇·伊万诺夫教她俩操作。打开电测仪器的电路图，全是俄文。不懂俄文，怎么办？刘敬宽拿出辞典来翻查。谢尔盖·安德烈维奇见了，严肃地说：“难道你们对操作不感兴趣吗？”
    “有兴趣。”
    “既然有兴趣，为什么不注意我操作呢？是不是有困难。”
    “我们不懂俄文。”
    “这没有关系，许多不懂俄文的同志都学会了各种操作，你们不懂便问吧！”
    夏天的阳光骄横地照着天山南北，汽车的篷顶被晒得火热，车内发电机隆隆作响，电测时，车门车窗，全都关上，车内又闷又热。谢尔盖·安德烈维奇胖得很，衣服经常被汗水湿透。本来，测完一段距离，他可以下车歇一阵，可是，他不。他在教着新来的两位实习生。一遍不懂，他又重来，在他的耐心帮助下，三个月后，姑娘们对操作也熟练了。
    一九五四年十月，我国同苏联发表联合公报，苏联把中苏石油公司移交给我国。随后中苏石油公司改为新疆石油公司，公司决定由刘敬宽担任电测队队长。她听了，愣了一阵：“怎么叫我担任队长呢？我一点经验也没有”。她找了公司地质调查处处长余萍，余萍勉励她要有信心，要接近群众，发挥大家的力量。同时告诉她苏联专家并不马上就离开，不懂的事可找专家。
    和余萍谈过话以后，她的信心增加了。初次担任行政领导工作，事事都很生疏，指挥别人也不顺手。没办法，什么事都亲自出马，填写领物单哪！到基地领材料哪！向运输处交涉车辆哪……大小事情，都一把抓，弄得又忙又乱，而队上的人有的却没事情可做。
    青年团员高崇久对她说：“队长！这样下去不行的，有什么事，可吩咐我们做。”牛家璧也说：“你应该学会安排工作，不必大小事情都揽在身上。”牛家璧又找队上的青年团员谈话，告诉他们搞好全队的工作，是每个青年团员应有的责任。团员们都动起来了。队上的临时工多，有的不安心工作，刘敬宽经常接近他们，找他们谈话，把个人利益和国家利益联系起来，打通他们的思想，他们也积极起来了。经过了几个月，队上的工作已经走上了轨道，刘敬宽也不像开始时那样缩手缩脚、忙忙乱乱了。
    清晨，工人和工程师把水箱灌满，吃罢早饭，带上几个馒头，坐上汽车，向野外电测站进发。牛家璧和工程师刘寿奎分别在两辆车上，指挥野外电测。刘敬宽有时同他们一道前往工地，有时留在队部安排全队的工作。傍晚或深夜，他们才从工地回来。每次回来，他们的脖子上、眉毛上、衣服上，都被灰尘盖满了。
    她俩的工作虽然紧张，担子虽然重，野外生活虽然艰苦，但她们的心情很愉快。她们深深地知道，党在支持她们，全国人民在关心她们，而她们的工作是在为祖国寻找石油。石油，人们称它“乌金”，那航行在天空的飞机，行驶在海洋的轮船，奔驰在公路上的汽车，都需要石油啊！“勘测队员们！为祖国寻找更多的油矿吧！”“海上的强盗在拦劫油船，勘测石油的人们！用你们的行动来粉碎敌人的封锁吧！”每当她俩想到这些，好像千万双眼睛在望着她们，千万颗心在期待她们，怎叫年轻的姑娘不奋勉前进呢？
    记得，去年冬天，勘测队员们从野外回到乌鲁木齐，几个队把材料汇集起来，共同研究，证实了她们勘测过的地区是很有希望的含油构造，姑娘们真有难以形容的快慰。
    她们曾经想像过新疆是一片荒凉、寒冷，但是，到了这里，就在她们勘测的地方，可以看到远处大面积的麦田中，微风掀起了金黄色的麦浪。可以看到没有尽头的棉田的万绿丛中，点缀着紫红色的花朵。长年披盖着白雪的天山流下源源不断的雪水，灌溉着万顷良田。在这没遮拦的原野，隔不了多远，便有交错的被汽车轮辗出来的“公路”，这么多的路，怎不令人兴奋啊！过去只是蒙族、哈萨克族放牧的地方，今天正吹起了社会主义建设的号角。
