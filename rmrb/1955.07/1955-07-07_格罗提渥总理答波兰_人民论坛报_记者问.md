　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 5th (TASS dispatch): The German News Agency published Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic's answers to questions from a reporter of the Polish "People's Tribune".

    Reporter: What is the significance of the treaty signed five years ago demarcating the borders between Germany and Poland? In his reply, Grotewohl pointed out that this treaty greatly strengthened the relationship between the peoples of the two countries. Under the leadership of their respective working-class parties, the German and Polish peoples are advancing along a new path towards a common goal, and this commonality of goals creates a decisive prerequisite for continuously strengthening German-Polish friendship and ensuring European peace.

    Reporter: What is the significance of the Soviet government's note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the future of Germany? In his answer, Grotewohl pointed out that the Soviet government's note is a new step in the Soviet Union's efforts to defend world peace and ensure European security. The government of the German Democratic Republic is very concerned about the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. Such normal relations will help Germans reach the necessary agreements, thereby helping to establish a unified, free, and democratic Germany.

    Reporter: What steps is the government of the German Democratic Republic prepared to take to continue the struggle for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis? Grotewohl replied that we will continue to pursue a firm policy of consultation and peace in this struggle. Now, we first advocate that, on the eve of the Four Power Heads of Government Conference, representatives of the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany formulate a common program requesting the withdrawal of occupying forces, the abolition of military bases, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the participation of a Germany unbound by any military alliance in a collective security system. The joint submission of a unified program by the Germans to the Four Power Heads of Government Conference will create favorable conditions for a positive solution to the German problem, thereby eliminating a hotbed of war in the center of Europe and ensuring the security and peace of the German people and the peoples of all countries.

　　格罗提渥总理答波兰“人民论坛报”记者问
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志通讯社发表了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥答波兰“人民论坛报”记者问。
    记者问，五年前签订的划定德波两国国界的条约的意义何在？格罗提渥在答复中指出，这一条约大大加强了两国人民之间的关系。德波两国人民在自己的工人阶级的政党的领导下，正沿着新的道路朝着共同的目标前进，这种目标的共同性为不断加强德波友谊和保障欧洲和平创造了决定性的前提。
    记者问，苏联给德意志联邦共和国政府的照会对德国的前途有怎样的意义？格罗提渥在回答中指出，苏联政府的照会是苏联努力保卫世界和平和保障欧洲安全的新步骤。德意志民主共和国政府十分关心德意志联邦共和国和苏联之间的关系的正常化。这种正常的关系有助于德国人之间达成必要的协议，从而有助于建立一个统一、自由和民主的德国。
    记者问，德意志民主共和国政府准备采取什么步骤继续为在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一而斗争？格罗提渥回答说，我们将在这一斗争中继续奉行坚定不移的协商与和平的政策。现在，我们首先主张，在四大国政府首脑会议的前夕，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的政府的代表制定一个共同的纲领，要求撤退占领军，取消军事基地，缔结和约，让不受任何军事同盟约束的德国参加集体安全体系。德国人向四大国政府首脑会议共同提出统一的纲领，将为德国问题获得积极的解决创造有利的条件，从而消除欧洲中心的战争温床，保障德国人民和一切国家的人民的安全和和平。
