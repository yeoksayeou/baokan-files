Representatives of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang attending the Second Session of the First National People's Congress expressed their warm support for the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. They believe that this plan reflects the common will of the people of the whole country to build our great motherland, and also expresses the common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Mamatniyaz, a representative of the Uyghur ethnic group, was particularly excited about the geographical distribution of the industries to be built in our country. He said that the implementation of this plan will change the unreasonable situation in the past where industries were mainly distributed in coastal cities, and the large-scale industries of our country will be established in all corners of the country (including remote areas) in the future. He believes that this is very conducive to the rapid development and universal utilization of my country's abundant resources. Maimaitiaisha, a representative of the Kyrgyz ethnic group, is very satisfied with the policy of focusing on the construction of heavy industry. He said that the main reason why our country's industry was underdeveloped and agriculture could not develop in the past was the lack of heavy industry. According to the first Five-Year Plan, our country has established the foundation of heavy industry, and our light industry, agriculture, and even cultural, educational, and health undertakings will develop rapidly. Therefore, he believes that this is a meticulous plan to fundamentally change my country's economic outlook. Yu Zhanlin, a representative of the Hui ethnic group, is particularly interested in the fact that our country will establish many new industrial bases according to the plan. He believes that this is a plan to give full play to the nation's human and material resources and construction potential. Patikhan Sugurbayev, a representative of the Kazakh ethnic group, believes that this plan is a plan to use our country's abundant resources to create a bright future and a happy life for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. He said that this plan can represent and reflect the common aspirations and interests of all ethnic groups. Daxiafu, a representative of the Mongolian ethnic group, was particularly excited about the measures in the Five-Year Plan concerning the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. He said: "In the Tarim River Basin in southern Xinjiang, there is a large amount of fertile land waiting for us to open up. That is truly land where 'a handful of soil can be squeezed out of oil'. With the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, grain and cotton production there will be greatly developed, and large areas of 'wheat sea' and 'cotton mountains' will appear. The vast Gobi Desert there will also gradually become an oasis. The development and utilization of the vast forests and water sources there will vigorously support my country's industrial construction." Mamat Niyaz Hari, a representative of the Uyghur ethnic group, is a businessman. He believes that our country has already made amazing achievements in all aspects in just a few years; the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan will enable our country to achieve even greater achievements. Merinishahan Aini, a Uyghur representative, is a female primary school teacher. She said that the first Five-Year Plan is permeated with the country's infinite concern for the people's lives and future, and shows that our country is making every effort to create a bright future for the people of the whole country; the realization of the Five-Year Plan will make our country's industrial and agricultural production more developed and the people's lives happier. All representatives from Xinjiang Province expressed that they would unite the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and work together to victoriously realize the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.
