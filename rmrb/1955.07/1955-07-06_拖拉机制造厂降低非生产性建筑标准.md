Tractor Factory Lowers Standards for Non-Productive Buildings

    The tractor factory has developed plans and measures to lower the standards for non-productive buildings, in order to accumulate construction funds for the country.

    In April of this year, the factory revised the construction standards for employee dormitories in accordance with the spirit of practicing thrift and opposing waste. The batch of houses that started construction in May reduced unnecessary decorations from the original design, reducing the cost from 82 yuan per square meter to 68 yuan, saving 560,000 yuan for the whole month. Recently, on the premise of being applicable and economical, further accounting and review have been carried out on the annual construction plan, reducing the standard of houses built in June to 58 yuan per square meter, saving 730,000 yuan for the whole month. It has been decided that all dormitories starting construction after July will be designed as bungalows, with a cost of 35 yuan per square meter, totaling 37,000 square meters, which can save 2.45 million yuan. According to research by the factory's design department, in the past, residents of the buildings had to pay 7 or 8 yuan in rent per month per room. For employee families with large populations who needed to occupy two or three rooms, they had to spend about 20 yuan per month on rent, plus water and electricity costs, which even section-level staff felt was too much of a burden. The bungalows planned now are more in line with the actual needs of the employees. Other construction plans such as roads and primary schools within the factory have also been reduced.

    In total, the annual savings for the above-mentioned non-productive buildings amount to more than 4.23 million yuan.

　　拖拉机制造厂降低非生产性建筑标准
    拖拉机制造厂为了给国家积累建设资金，已经作出降低非生产性建筑标准的方案和措施。
    今年四月，这个厂就根据厉行节约反对浪费的精神，修改了职工宿舍的建筑标准。五月份开工的一批房子，从原设计中减掉了不必要的装饰，每平方公尺由八十二元降到六十八元，全月节约了五十六万元。最近又在适用和经济的前提下，对全年的建设计划作了进一步的核算和审查，把六月份所盖房子的标准每平方公尺降低为五十八元，全月节约七十三万元。从七月以后开工的宿舍决定一律作平房设计，每平方公尺定为三十五元，共三万七千平方公尺，可节约二百四十五万元。据厂里设计部门研究，过去造的楼房，每间的居住者每月需交七、八元租金，凡人口多需占用两三间房子的职工家庭，每月就得花二十元左右的房租，还要另加水电费用，就是科长级的工作人员也感到负担太重。目前计划盖的平房，便比较切合职工们的实际需要。其他如厂内道路、小学校等的修建计划也作了缩减。
    总计上述各项非生产性建筑的全年节约数，共为四百二十三万多元。
