    No Obstruction of Vietnam's General Election Allowed

    In two days—July 20th, the two regions of Vietnam should, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, begin consultations to arrange the general election to be held next July. World opinion is closely watching the development of this major event.

    As everyone knows, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement as early as June 6th, expressing its willingness to hold this consultation with the South Vietnamese authorities as scheduled. However, the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities have been trying to use empty talk about elections and create excuses to evade the Vietnamese general election and undermine the Geneva Accords.

    Ngo Dinh Diem's broadcast speech on the 16th once again exposed this attempt.

    News in recent days says that Ngo Dinh Diem is being forced by world opinion to express his attitude, but in his speech, he only stated that his government "does not oppose elections," while openly stating that "there is no question of considering any proposals from the Viet Minh" regarding the upcoming consultations. He also insisted that he was not bound by the Geneva Accords. This shows that he still does not want to arrange the general election through consultation. But if the general election is not arranged through consultation, how can we talk about holding a general election? Ngo Dinh Diem is obviously trying to evade the criticism of public opinion in this way in order to delay and sabotage the Vietnamese general election.

    Ngo Dinh Diem keeps talking about "for the cause of the nation," but from his past actions and this speech, there is not a trace of the Vietnamese people's spirit. He does not put Vietnam's peace and national interests in his eyes at all, but loyally follows Washington's policies, reciting Dulles's and the American propaganda machine's clichés word for word.

    Recently, editorials continuously published by "The New York Times" have fully exposed the tricks Washington has been plotting day and night. This newspaper says on the one hand that the United States and South Vietnam are not signatories to the Geneva Accords; on the other hand, it says that the "prospects" for "electoral freedom," which is "extremely important to the free world (should read: the United States)," are "not very bright"; and then it demands that the election be supervised by the United Nations or an "expanded International Commission."

    It is very clear that the American intention revealed by "The New York Times" is actually to tear up the Geneva Accords, rehash the absurd claims that the United States had already been refuted and rejected at the Geneva Conference, that is, to have the United Nations, that is, the United States, interfere in the Vietnamese general election and impose a reactionary regime on the Vietnamese people. Only such an election is considered acceptable by the United States and its agents in South Vietnam.

    The Associated Press bluntly admitted that the United States hopes to "possibly modify the terms of the Geneva Accords themselves"; "Saigon will only participate in the general election when the general election is held under the auspices (should read: interference) of the United States." Isn't this enough to illustrate America's most arrogant plan?

    If we compare Ngo Dinh Diem's speech with this American plan, is there anything that does not conform to Washington's intentions?

    Ngo Dinh Diem, like a parrot, emphasized the so-called "freedom" or "absolute freedom" of elections, and pretended to "express doubt about the possibility of creating such free conditions in the North." But this absolutely cannot conceal their guilty conscience and timidity towards free general elections. When the Associated Press shamelessly publicized that there could not be a "free" general election in Vietnam, it estimated that Ngo Dinh Diem's group, which is opposed to the people, would be "pessimistic" not only in the North but also in South Vietnam in terms of "achieving victory." Therefore, the Associated Press openly clamored: "Holding elections in a country where the majority of the people are illiterate and the concept of democratic elections is alien to them is an unreasonable demand." This clamor actually shows the fear of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group towards the genuine general election movement of the Vietnamese people. They are afraid that the Vietnamese people will further demonstrate their strong will to strive for national unification through general elections.

    It is precisely because the United States and its agents are afraid of the free choice of the Vietnamese people that they want to strangle this freedom and obstruct and undermine the Vietnamese general election, in order to split Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a US colony and military base.

    The full implementation of the Geneva Accords is being seriously threatened with destruction. Agence France-Presse also reported that Ngo Dinh Diem's speech "is clearly an act of rejecting the Geneva Accords." This is absolutely not allowed. The Vietnamese people's desire to achieve unification through free general elections must be respected. The countries concerned at the Geneva Conference should ensure that the Vietnamese general election can be successfully realized. If the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities continue to obstruct the Vietnamese general election, then they will not be able to escape the serious responsibility they should bear.

### 不许阻挠越南的普选

    不许阻挠越南的普选
    再过两天——七月二十日，越南双方地区就应遵照日内瓦协议规定，开始进行协商，安排明年七月举行的普选。全世界舆论都在密切注视着这一重大事件的发展。
    大家知道，越南民主共和国政府早在六月六日就已发表声明，表明愿意同南越当局按期举行这一协商。但是，美国和南越当局却一直在想用空谈选举，制造借口，来规避越南普选，破坏日内瓦协议。
    吴庭艳十六日发表的广播演说，就又一次暴露了这个企图。
    这几天的消息说，吴庭艳正被世界舆论迫得不能不表明一下他的态度，可是，他在演说中，只是表示他的政府“不去反对选举”，而对于即将举行的协商问题却公然说“根本谈不上考虑越盟任何建议的问题”。他还硬说他不受日内瓦协议的约束。这表明他还是不想经过协商来安排普选。但是如果不经过协商来安排普选，又怎么谈得到进行普选呢？吴庭艳显然是想这样躲过舆论的指责，以达到拖延和破坏越南普选的目的。
    吴庭艳口口声声说什么“为了民族事业”，但从他过去的行动和这次演说中，嗅不到半点越南人的气息。他根本不把越南的和平和民族利益放在眼中，而只是忠顺地奉行着华盛顿的政策，一字一句地背诵着杜勒斯和美国宣传机器的陈腔滥调。
    最近，“纽约时报”连续发表的社论，已充分地暴露了华盛顿日夜盘算的勾当。这个报纸一则说，美国和南越都不是日内瓦协议的签字国；再则说，“对于自由世界（应读作美国）极其重要的”“选举自由”的“前途是不太光明的”；然后就要求由联合国或者“扩大的国际委员会”来监督选举。
    十分清楚，“纽约时报”透露的美国意图，实际上是要撕毁日内瓦协议，重新搬出美国在日内瓦会议上已遭到驳斥和拒绝的荒谬主张，即由联合国也就是由美国来干涉越南普选，把反动政权强加在越南人民身上。只有这样的选举，美国和它在南越的代理人才认为是可以接受的。
    合众社露骨地承认，美国希望“可能对日内瓦协定条款本身加以修改”；“只有普选在美国的斡旋（应读作干涉）下举行时，西贡才会参加普选。”这难道不足说明美国最狂妄的打算吗？
    拿美国这个打算对照来看一下，吴庭艳的演说有什么不符华盛顿的意旨之处呢？
    吴庭艳像鹦鹉学舌般强调所谓选举的“自由”或“绝对自由”，装模作样地对“使北方具备这种自由的条件的可能性根本表示怀疑”。但这绝对掩饰不了他们对自由普选的心虚和胆怯。合众社在无耻地宣传越南不可能有“自由的”普选时，就估计说，吴庭艳这个同人民对立的集团，将不仅在北部而且在南越要“取得胜利”也是“悲观的”。因此，合众社就公然叫嚣说：“在一个大多数人民是文盲而民主选举的观念对于他们是陌生的国家中，举行选举是一种无理的要求。”这种叫嚣实际上正表明了美国和吴庭艳集团对越南人民真正的普选运动的恐惧。他们害怕越南人民通过普选进一步显示他们争取民族统一的强烈意志。
    美国及其代理人正是因为害怕越南人民的自由选择，所以它们就想扼杀这个自由，就想阻挠和破坏越南普选，以便分裂越南，把南越变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    日内瓦协议的全部实施，正在受到严重破坏的威胁。法新社的报道也指出：吴庭艳的演说，“显然是拒绝日内瓦协定的行动”。这是绝对不能容许的。越南人民通过自由普选实现统一的愿望必须受到尊重。日内瓦会议的有关国家都应该保证越南普选能够顺利实现。如果美国和南越当局继续阻挠越南的普选，那末，它们将不能逃避它们所应负的严重责任。
