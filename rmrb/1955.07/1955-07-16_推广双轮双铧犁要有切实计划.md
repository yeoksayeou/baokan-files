    A Practical Plan Is Needed to Promote the Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow
    Xue Feng, Yang Pu
    The number of double-wheel double-share plows planned for promotion nationwide this year greatly exceeds that of any previous year. To accomplish this task, we must work hard to complete a series of arduous tasks.
    However, judging from the promotion of double-wheel double-share plows in various regions in the first half of this year, many staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments in various regions have an insufficient understanding of the arduousness of the promotion of double-wheel double-share plows, and have therefore adopted a perfunctory approach to the supply of double-wheel double-share plows. For example, some regions did not seriously investigate and understand the local situation and conditions before supplying double-wheel double-share plows, and blindly determined the supply plan; some regions did not conduct serious publicity work when supplying this agricultural tool to farmers, but adopted a simple distribution method. The result of adopting this wrong approach is that although the double-wheel double-share plow has been "promoted" to farmers, the farmers do not like to use it for farming, but instead have some misunderstandings and concerns, which have caused some difficulties for future promotion work.
    Experience has proved that formulating a practical and feasible promotion plan based on local conditions before promoting double-wheel double-share plows is an important link in doing a good job in promotion. Before determining the supply plan for double-wheel double-share plows, the agricultural department and supply and marketing cooperative of Teng County, Shandong Province, first specifically investigated and analyzed the possible conditions for 39 agricultural cooperatives in the county to purchase double-wheel double-share plows from the following four aspects: 1. Whether there are purchasing funds or possible sources of funds; 2. Whether there are technicians who can use double-wheel double-share plows in the new and old cooperatives; 3. What is the situation of draught animals; 4. Whether the terrain and soil are suitable. As a result of this research, 23 of the 39 cooperatives could purchase, so the supply and marketing cooperative's plan to supply 23 double-wheel double-share plows this spring was fully realized, which avoided both stockpiling and satisfied the needs of farmers. However, some other regions did not do this. For example, Bo'ai County in Henan Province once mechanically determined the supply plan for double-wheel double-share plows according to the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county. There are 570 agricultural cooperatives in the county, and the agricultural department and the supply and marketing cooperative determined the supply plan for 500 double-wheel double-share plows. However, among these 570 cooperatives, 150 cooperatives cultivate mountainous land, which is not suitable for using double-wheel double-share plows, 140 cooperatives are cultivated by agricultural machinery stations, and 60 cooperatives are unable to purchase them. In this way, only 220 cooperatives can actually purchase them. It can be seen that the county's determination of the supply plan of 500 units is blind and too large. If this subjective plan is not changed quickly, it will inevitably cause a large backlog of double-wheel double-share plows and promote the error of commandism in promotion work.
    To promote new-style animal-powered agricultural tools, we must adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mobilize farmers to purchase them with their own money according to the needs of production; those who are indeed unable to purchase them due to production needs can borrow money from the bank and then go to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy them. However, some regions erroneously adopted the method of selling on credit or borrowing this spring to promote double-wheel double-share plows. This is what some areas in Jiangsu Province did. For example, Guanyun County sold 39 double-wheel double-share plows on credit, Huaian County sold 40 on credit, and Zhangji Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shuyang County had four double-wheel double-share plows placed in agricultural cooperatives for free use. Some district staff members in Xinyi, Shuyang, and other counties also guaranteed farmers, allowing supply and marketing cooperatives to sell double-wheel double-share plows to farmers on credit. As a result, the supply and marketing cooperative's funds were in difficulty, and the farmers developed a mentality of simply relying on the state, and did not pay attention to the storage and maintenance of agricultural tools. Why does this phenomenon occur? This is because the rural staff in these areas are unwilling to do in-depth and meticulous work, and attempt to use the easiest and simplest method to "complete" the task of promoting double-wheel double-share plows. Of course, adopting this approach will never achieve the purpose of promoting double-wheel double-share plows. If we want to truly complete the task of promoting double-wheel double-share plows, the only correct approach is to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, and at the same time do a good job in cultivating typical examples and organizing visits, so that farmers can see the fact that using double-wheel double-share plows can increase production, and thus are willing to purchase this agricultural tool.
    The task of promoting double-wheel double-share plows in the second half of this year is more arduous than in the first half of the year, and the staff of supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments in various regions must step up their efforts to ensure the completion of this task. At present, the agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives of various provinces should, together with the agricultural tool manufacturing departments, organize forces to go deep into counties, districts, and villages, and go deep into agricultural tool wholesale units and warehouses to comprehensively check the allocation, storage, and sales of double-wheel double-share plows and other new-style animal-powered agricultural tools, and overcome the perfunctory approach in supply work. Problems found in the inspection should be helped to solve in a timely manner.

### 推广双轮双铧犁要有切实计划

    推广双轮双铧犁要有切实计划
    薛凤　杨璞
    今年全国计划推广的双轮双铧犁的数量大大超过以往任何一年；要完成这个任务，必须努力做好一系列艰巨的工作。
    但是，从今年上半年各地推广双轮双铧犁的情况看，不少地区的供销合作社和农业部门的工作人员对于双轮双铧犁推广工作的艰巨性是认识不足的，因而在双轮双铧犁的供应工作中采取了草率从事的作法。例如，有些地区在供应双轮双铧犁之前没有认真地调查了解本地区的情况和条件，就盲目地确定了供应计划；有些地区在把这种农具供应给农民时，不认真进行宣传工作，而采取单纯分配的作法。采用这种错误作法的结果是：虽然把双轮双铧犁“推广”给了农民，但是农民并不喜欢用它来耕地，反而使他们产生了一些误会和顾虑，给今后的推广工作造成了一些困难。
    经验证明，在推广双轮双铧犁之前，根据当地的具体条件制定出切实可行的推广计划，是做好推广工作的重要环节。山东省滕县农业部门和供销合作社在确定双轮双铧犁供应计划之前，首先从以下四个方面具体地调查分析了本县三十九个农业合作社购买双轮双铧犁的可能条件：一、有无购买资金或可能的资金来源；二、新社、老社中有无使用双轮双铧犁的技术手；三、耕畜情况如何；四、地形土质是否适宜。这样研究的结果，三十九个社中有二十三个社可以购买，因此供销社依此确定的今春供应二十三部双轮双铧犁的计划便全部实现了，既避免了积压，又满足了农民的需要。但另外有些地区却不是这样做的，例如河南省博爱县曾经机械地按照全县农业合作社的数目来确定双轮双铧犁的供应计划。这个县共有五百七十个农业合作社，农业部门和供销社便确定了五百部双轮双铧犁的供应计划。但是，这五百七十个社中，有一百五十个社耕种的是山地，不适于使用双轮双铧犁，有一百四十个社由农业机器站代耕，还有六十个社无力购买。这样，实际上可能购买的只有二百二十个社。可见这个县确定五百部的供应计划是盲目的、偏大的。这种主观主义的计划如不迅速改变，必然造成双轮双铧犁的大量积压，并助长推广工作中的强迫命令的错误。
    推广新式畜力农具，必须坚持自愿原则，动员农民根据生产的需要自己出钱来购买；生产需要确实无力购买者，可向银行借款，然后到供销社去买。但是今年春季有些地区竟错误地采取赊销或借用的办法，来推广双轮双铧犁。江苏省部分地区就是这样做的。例如灌云县赊销双轮双铧犁三十九部，淮安县赊销四十部，沭阳县章集供销社有四部双轮双铧犁白白地放在农业合作社里使用。新沂、沭阳等县有些区工作人员还给农民担保，让供销社向农民赊销双轮双铧犁。这样做的结果，既使供销社的资金发生困难，又使农民产生单纯依赖国家的心理，不注意对农具的保管和养护。为什么会发生这种现象呢？这是因为这些地区的农村工作人员不愿做深入、细致的工作，企图用最省事、最简单的办法来“完成”推广双轮双铧犁的任务。当然，采用这种做法决不能达到推广双轮双铧犁的目的。要想真正完成推广双轮双铧犁的任务，唯一正确的做法只能是：进行深入的宣传动员，同时做好培养典型、组织参观等工作，使农民看到使用双轮双铧犁能够增加生产的事实，从而乐意购买这种农具。
    今年下半年推广双轮双铧犁的任务比上半年更加繁重，各地供销合作社和农业部门的工作人员必须加紧努力，保证完成这个任务。目前各省农业部门和供销社应会同农具制造部门组织力量，深入县区和乡村，深入农具批发单位和仓库，全面检查双轮双铧犁和其他新式畜力农具的调拨、储备和销售情况，克服供应工作中的草率从事的作法。在检查中发现的问题，应及时帮助解决。
