Hubei's Lakeside Areas Along the Yangtze River Increase Late Rice Planting

　　In Hubei Province's flood-affected areas of 1954, the plan is to sow 1.5 million mu of late rice this year, doubling the sown area compared to 1953. Currently, the 14 million jin of late rice seeds transferred by the government from provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Zhejiang have been supplied to various regions, and farmers are seizing the opportune time to sow.

　　There are 27 or 28 counties in the lakeside areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province that are suitable for planting double-cropping rice. In the past, due to the relatively poor quality of local late rice varieties, pest damage from rice stem borers, and insufficient labor and fertilizer, the sown area of late rice was not large, and the yield per unit area was not high. After these areas suffered flooding in 1954, there was an accumulation of fertile mud; some rice stem borers died, and pest damage could be reduced; in addition, most of the late rice seeds are high-yielding varieties transferred from other places. Therefore, there are better conditions to strive for an extra harvest. Estimating at the lowest unit yield, the late rice whose sowing area is expanded this year in these areas can produce 300 million jin of grain, which will greatly contribute to the restoration of production in the disaster areas.

　　湖北沿江滨湖地区增播晚稻
    湖北省一九五四年大水地区，今年计划播种晚稻一百五十万亩，比一九五三年播种面积扩大了一倍。目前政府由江西、湖南、浙江等省调进的一千四百万斤晚稻种籽已经供应到各地，农民正在抢火色下种。
    湖北省沿江滨湖地区共有二十七、八个县适宜种植双季稻。过去，因为本地晚稻品种较差，以及螟虫为害，劳力和肥料不足等，晚稻的播种面积不大，单位面积产量也不高。这些地区一九五四年遭受水淹以后，有淤积肥泥；一部分螟虫死亡，螟害可以减轻；加上晚稻种籽大部分又是由外地调来的高产品种，因此，有较好的条件争取多收一季。以最低的单位产量估计，这些地区今年扩大播种的晚稻，能产三亿斤粮食，对恢复灾区生产有很大作用。　（袁军）
