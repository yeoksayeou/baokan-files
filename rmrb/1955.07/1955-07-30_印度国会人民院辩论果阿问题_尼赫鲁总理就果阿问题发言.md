Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th. The Indian Lok Sabha conducted a debate on the Goa issue on the 26th. Members of parliament from various parties expressed strong anger at Portugal's continued occupation of Indian territory and firm determination to liberate Goa in their speeches. They welcomed the Indian government's decision to ask Portugal to close its embassy in New Delhi and severely condemned Portugal's atrocities against volunteers demonstrating in Goa.

    Ranga Sundaram, an independent member of parliament from Andhra Pradesh and convener of the Goa Issue Committee of Indian Parliamentary Parties, called for a cessation of trade relations with Goa and Portugal, and demanded that Indian naval vessels prevent the Portuguese from transporting armaments into Goa from abroad. Gopalan, leader of the Communist Party of India's parliamentary group, said that the Goa issue is a national issue, and the Indian people cannot remain silent until Goa is liberated. He called for an economic blockade of Goa.

    Prime Minister Nehru made a final speech. He said that Portugal's occupation of Goa is an interference in the political system established in India today. He said that for the sake of national unity and security, India cannot allow foreign countries to occupy strongholds in India, no matter how small. This is a stronghold, this is interference, and this is a potential danger in the future. This is even more so when the country occupying this stronghold says that it is bound by various obligations. Because this is not just a stronghold of that country, but a stronghold of many countries, many allies.

    Referring to the demand for economic sanctions against the Portuguese occupiers, Nehru said: What the government has done is effective, and may gradually become more effective. He added that the government could take further measures in trade and other areas based on the government's peaceful policy.

    Nehru emphasized that Goa must be merged with India. India's independence would be unimaginable if part of Indian territory remained under foreign control.

    印度国会人民院辩论果阿问题
    尼赫鲁总理就果阿问题发言
    新华社新德里二十八日电　印度国会人民院二十六日进行了关于果阿问题的辩论。各党派议员在发言时表示了对于葡萄牙继续占领印度领土的强烈愤怒和解放果阿的坚定决心。他们欢迎印度政府要求葡萄牙关闭驻新德里的公使馆的决定，并且严厉谴责葡萄牙对在果阿境内举行示威的志愿人员的暴行。
    安得拉省无党派议员、印度各党派国会议员果阿问题委员会召集人朗卡·松达拉姆要求停止同果阿和葡萄牙的贸易关系，并且要求用印度的海军舰艇制止葡萄牙人从外边把军火运入果阿。印度国会共产党国会党团领袖高普兰说，果阿问题是全国的问题，在果阿得到解放以前印度人民不能保持沉默。他要求对果阿实行经济封锁。
    尼赫鲁总理最后作了发言。他说，葡萄牙占领果阿是对今天在印度确立的政治制度的干涉。他说，为了国家的统一和安全，印度不能容许外国在印度占有据点，不论它是多么小。这是据点，这就是干涉，这就是将来可能的危险。当占有这个据点的国家说它受到各种义务约束的时候，就更加如此。因为这不仅仅是那个国家的据点，而且是许多国家，许多盟国的据点。
    尼赫鲁在谈到对葡萄牙占领者实行经济制裁的要求时说：政府所做的是有效的，而且可能逐渐更为有效。他又说，政府可以依据政府的和平政策在贸易和其他方面采取进一步措施。
    尼赫鲁强调说，果阿必须和印度合并。如果印度的部分领土仍然被外国控制，印度的独立将会是不可想像的。
