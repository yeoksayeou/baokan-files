　　Mancheng County Basically Completes Summer Grain Purchase Task

Farmers in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, actively support the grain purchase policy and enthusiastically sell grain to the state. From June 21st to 25th, in five days, they sold a total of more than 4.29 million jin of wheat, accounting for 82% of the county's unified purchase task. Fifty-eight villages have completed the work of grain requisition, unified purchase, and unified sales. In the grain purchase, more than 100 Party members, League members, and rural staff in Nanhan Township took the lead in paying their own requisitioned quotas, driving farmers throughout the township to complete the task of purchasing 143,000 jin of grain in two days. Many agricultural production cooperatives have launched patriotic grain delivery competitions during the grain purchase, promoting the smooth development of summer grain purchase work throughout the county.

　　满城县基本完成夏粮征购任务
    河北省满城县农民积极拥护粮食征购政策，踊跃向国家缴售粮食。从六月二十一日至二十五日五天的时间内，共缴售小麦四百二十九万多斤，占全县统购任务百分之八十二，并有五十八个村结束了粮食征收、统购、统销工作。在征购粮食中，南韩乡党、团员和乡村工作人员一百多人，首先缴售清了自己应征购数字，带动全乡农民在两天内，完成了十四万三千多斤的粮食征购任务。许多农业生产合作社在征购粮食中都开展爱国缴粮竞赛，推动了全县夏季征购粮食工作顺利开展。
