　　Rampant Activities of Counter-Revolutionaries in Hunan
　　National People's Congress Representative Tan Tiwu
    If you walk around some cities in Hunan, you will feel the orderliness; if you look at some villages in Hunan, you will find them quiet and lovely. But some counter-revolutionaries are taking more covert ways to carry out sabotage activities. Now let me talk about some of the crimes of counter-revolutionaries in Hunan.
    The areas where counter-revolutionaries are active are mainly in the areas where several provinces or counties meet. These places are either inconvenient to access, or because our work force has not yet fully reached them. Some counter-revolutionaries hang up the signs of religious organizations, some wave the flags of reactionary political parties, and some appear in the name of reactionary armed forces. Their only purpose is to undermine socialist construction and socialist transformation, endanger the people's power, and help Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime restore its power.
    This spring, the Hunan Provincial Public Security Department cracked two cases of counter-revolutionary organizations plotting riots. One was the "China Revolutionary Party Yin Nan Unit Four-Province Border Region Headquarters" cracked on March 17 in Fenghuang County, which borders Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou. Reactionary documents such as slogans, symbols, leaflets, and announcements were seized. The leaders were pseudo-township chief Long Fengxiang and bandit Long Enting. They were preparing to riot at midnight on March 18. With the help of the local masses, the government cracked the case the day before they were about to riot.
    The other was the "Fu (Zhong) Yong (Ming) Jiang (Hua) Seventh Army First Independent Regiment" cracked on April 9 in Jianghua County, which borders Hunan and Guangxi. This counter-revolutionary armed organization was initiated by Liao Guangwen, a bandit from Shijia Township, Fuzhong County, Guangxi. After Liao Guangwen organized a group of people in Guangxi, he came to Hunan to develop, contacted the bandit Chen Yuefang in Bainiushan, contacted the bandit leader Kong Xianglin in Jianshan Township, Jianghua Fourteenth District, and developed habitual thieves, family members of counter-revolutionaries, and pseudo-military officers. Eleven people were arrested in Hunan, and the remaining four fled to Guangxi. Subsequently, Hunan and Guangxi jointly encircled and suppressed them, eradicating its roots.
    This year, counter-revolutionaries in Xiangtan, Yiyang and other places beat and killed cadres. Wang Wanchun, a counter-revolutionary in Liutian Township, Xiangtan Eleventh District, simultaneously injured a joint group leader and a mutual aid group leader with a knife.
    Thirty-four cases of arson by counter-revolutionaries have been identified. The People's Bank branch and township government in Daqiao Township, Eighth District, Longhui County, were burned. The grain depot in Zhuhe Township, Eighth District, Suining County, was burned, resulting in a loss of more than 100,000 catties of grain. In addition, three incidents of counter-revolutionaries setting fire to factories and mines occurred, resulting in a loss of more than 2.15 million yuan. The Dong'an County Local State-Owned Rosin Processing Factory was set on fire by counter-revolutionary Fu Bin, resulting in a loss of more than 110,000 yuan.
    During the spring ploughing production period in March this year, counter-revolutionaries spread rumors saying, "There was a big flood last year, and there will be a big drought this year. Red-haired wild men are born, eating people when they see them." After this rumor spread, some people did not dare to go to the fields to produce during the day, did not dare to go out at night, and mutual aid groups did not dare to hold meetings. When Huangpu Town, You County Fourth District, was holding a meeting, someone spread a rumor saying, "The red-haired wild men have arrived." Someone in Xiangtan County spread a rumor saying, "The government is going to liberate Taiwan, and salt cannot come," inciting the masses to go to the cooperative to buy all the salt. One person bought salt that he could not finish eating in three years.
    The central government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a combination of suppression and leniency. The implementation of this policy in Hunan has enabled many counter-revolutionaries to be reformed, proving that this policy is correct. However, there are also some incorrigible counter-revolutionaries who have been treated with leniency but do not know how to repent. Li Defeng, a landlord who once served as a pseudo-military officer in Anren County, was released from prison on October 18 last year. On the 26th of the same month, he retaliated against the township cadres and killed the township cadres.
    According to statistics from the Public Security Department, 11 percent (95 people) of the criminals captured in Hengyang City in 1954 had been previously educated and released. 14 percent of the criminals captured in Changde City in 1953 had been released after labor reform. In 1954, the number of criminals captured who had been released after labor reform increased to 39 percent.
    The percentage of people who commit crimes again after being released from control ranges from 5% to 15%.
    The party and government leaders and responsible persons from all aspects of Hunan Province continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary activities. The day before we left Changsha, Chairman Zhou Xiaozhou of the CPPCC convened an enlarged standing committee meeting. The people who attended the meeting cited many facts they had seen and heard and unanimously requested the government to vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries.
    I completely agree with the opinions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and believe that counter-revolutionaries should be severely suppressed. In addition, I also hope that the Party and the government will strengthen socialist education for cadres and the masses, so that they can recognize the arduousness of socialist construction and the acuteness and complexity of class struggle in socialist transformation, so as to strengthen their determination to struggle for the construction of a socialist society, and overcome their paralyzing thoughts and improve their vigilance against the enemy. In addition, we must also earnestly correct the shortcomings of some staff members in their work of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, eliminate the positions for counter-revolutionary activities, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and enable us to smoothly move towards a socialist society.

### 反革命分子在湖南的猖狂活动

　　反革命分子在湖南的猖狂活动
　　全国人民代表大会代表　谭惕吾
    你在湖南某些城市里走走，就会感到秩序井然；到湖南某些乡村里看看，你会觉得安静可爱。但有的反革命分子就更加采取隐蔽的方式进行破坏活动，现在就让我来谈一些反革命分子在湖南的罪行罢。
    反革命分子活动的地区，主要在几省或几县交界的地方。这些地方或者因为交通不便，或者因为我们的工作力量还没有充分达到，反革命分子有的挂着宗教组织的招牌，有的打着反动党派的旗帜，有的用反动武装的名称出现。他们的目的只有一个：就是破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造、危害人民政权，帮助蒋介石反动政权复辟。
    今春湖南省公安厅破获了两起反革命分子组织的阴谋暴动案件。一起是三月十七日在湖南和湖北、四川、贵州交界的凤凰县所破获的“中国革命党殷难部队四省边区指挥部”，搜出了口号、符号、传单和布告等反动文件。为首的是伪乡长龙凤翔和土匪龙恩庭。他们准备在三月十八日子时暴动。后经当地群众协助政府在他们准备暴动的前一天就破了案。
    另一起是四月九日在湖南和广西交界的江华县所破获的“富（钟）永（明）江（华）第七军第一独立团”。这一反革命武装组织是由广西富钟县石家乡土匪廖光文发起组织的。廖光文在广西组织了
  一部分人后就到湖南来发展，在白牛山联络了土匪陈曰芳，在江华十四区箭山乡联络了土匪头子孔祥林，并发展了惯盗、反革命分子家属、伪军官等。经湖南逮捕的十一人，其余四人逃到广西。随后由湖南和广西联合围剿，将它的根子铲除。
    今年反革命分子在湘潭、益阳等地打干部和杀干部，湘潭十一区刘田乡一个联组组长和一个互助组组长被反革命分子王万春同时用刀砍伤。
    已查明反革命分子放火的案件有三十四起。隆回县第八区大桥乡人民银行营业所和乡政府被烧。绥宁县第八区朱和乡粮食仓库被烧，损失粮食十多万斤。此外反革命分子放火烧厂矿企业的事件发生了三起，损失二百一十五万多元。东安县地方国营松脂加工厂被反革命分子傅斌纵火烧光，损失十一万多元。
    今年三月开展春耕生产期中，反革命分子造谣说：“去年大水，今年大旱，红毛野人出世，见人吃人。”这谣言散播之后，有的群众白天不敢到田地生产，晚间不敢出门，互助组不敢开会。攸县第四区黄浦镇正在开会时有人放谣言说：“红毛野人到了。”湘潭县有人造谣说：“政府要解放台湾，食盐不能来了”，煽动群众到合作社去把全部食盐抢购光了。有一个人买了三年都吃不完的食盐。
    中央的镇压反革命政策是镇压与宽大相结合的，湖南在执行这一政策中使不少反革命分子得到改造，证明这一政策是正确的。但是也有一些怙恶不悛的反革命分子受到宽大的处理而不知改悔。安仁县一个曾任伪军官的地主李德峰去年十月十八日刑满释放回家，同月二十六日找乡干部报复，杀死了乡干部。
    据公安厅统计，衡阳市一九五四年捕获案犯中有百分之十一（九十五名）是过去教育释放了的。常德市一九五三年捕获的案犯中有百分之十四是经过劳动改造释放的。一九五四年捕获的案犯中经过劳动改造释放的增加到百分之三十九。
    解除管制后重新犯罪的占百分之五到百分之十五。
    湖南省的党政领导同志和各方面的负责人继续肃清反革命的活动。在我们离开长沙的前一天，政协周小舟主席召开了扩大常委会议，出席会议的人举出了许多亲见亲闻的事实，一致要求政府对反革命分子实行大力镇压。
    我是完全同意湖南省政协委员会的意见的，认为对反革命分子应该予以严厉镇压。除此以外，我还希望党和政府加强对干部和群众的社会主义教育，使他们认识到社会主义建设的艰巨性和社会主义改造中阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性，以坚定他们为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的决心，并克服他们的麻痹思想，提高他们对敌人的警惕。除此以外，我们还要认真改正有些工作人员在工作中脱离群众和脱离实际的缺点，消灭反革命分子活动的阵地，更加巩固工农联盟，使我们顺利地走向社会主义社会去。
