    The Golden Star Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative After the Removal of Counter-Revolutionaries
    By Our Correspondent Bǎi Shēng
    During the National People's Congress, I interviewed Li Shunda, representative to the National People's Congress and director of the Golden Star Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and Shen Jilan, the cooperative's deputy director, to ask them about the situation in the Golden Star Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative after the removal of the counter-revolutionaries Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze.

    Li Shunda first told me: This incident has given us a profound lesson. When I visited the Soviet Union in the past, I heard Soviet comrades say that the more highly developed collectivization is, the more acute and complex the class struggle becomes. During the Soviet collectivization movement, there were constant incidents of rich peasants sabotaging collective farms. Therefore, I knew in my mind that counter-revolutionaries would sabotage our cooperative movement. But why were we unable to prevent the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries in our cooperative in Xigou Township? The main reason is that our eyes were not bright, we were not good at distinguishing between good people and bad people in actual struggle, and we were politically paralyzed and lost the necessary vigilance. When our cooperative was first established in the winter of 1951, the counter-revolutionaries Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze pretended to be active and progressive, wormed their way into the cooperative, and successively tricked us into giving them the positions of labor group leader and accountant, gaining favorable conditions for carrying out sabotage activities. At that time, although we also knew that these two counter-revolutionaries had a history of counter-revolutionary activities, we always thought that they had reformed themselves after the government's lenient treatment and education. In addition, they could write, calculate, and speak well, so I thought they were still useful to us, and I ignored the possibility of them carrying out sabotage, and as a result, we suffered from them in the struggle.

    Li Shunda and Shen Jilan both believe that this incident has provided a very profound education for themselves and all members of the cooperative. The incident sounded an alarm for everyone, making everyone deeply aware that with the rapid development of the cooperative movement, the class struggle in the countryside has not eased, but has become increasingly complex and acute. The resolute counter-revolutionaries from those classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated will inevitably intensify their sabotage of the agricultural production cooperative movement. Any slight negligence on our part will create opportunities for the enemy to carry out sabotage.

    Speaking of this, Li Shunda further said: "In the process of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the more people there are and the larger the cooperative is, the more we must improve our class vigilance and pay attention to observing and analyzing various problems from a class perspective. In this counter-revolutionary sabotage incident that occurred in our cooperative, I made the mistake of blurring the class viewpoint. In the past, I always thought that after the land reform and production movement, the countryside had already become dominated by middle peasants, and the rich peasant economy had declined due to restrictions. Therefore, I felt that the class struggle in the countryside seemed to have eased. This understanding is completely wrong. In the future, for myself, the first thing is to improve my ideological understanding and revolutionary vigilance, strengthen the political leadership of agricultural cooperatives, and conscientiously implement the Party's class line in the countryside, so that I can avoid making mistakes in my work and ensure the smooth development of our cooperative movement."

    Li Shunda and Shen Jilan told me that after exposing and removing the counter-revolutionaries Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze from the Golden Star Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative, the situation in all aspects has improved. Many problems left over from the past have been resolved one by one. This has made the members of the cooperative feel very happy, and they are working even harder. For example, in the past, the counter-revolutionary Zhang Laiquan used his position as accountant to embezzle the salary rice of poor peasant member Lu Wenquan, and changed the account of Lu Wenquan's share of grain, causing Lu Wenquan to have 600 jin of grain deducted from what he was due. Now the cooperative has supplemented Lu Wenquan with 250 jin of grain, and the remaining amount has been compensated to him in money. Lu Wenquan was very satisfied and moved by this treatment. He said: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government having sharp eyes and eradicating these counter-revolutionaries, my whole family would have been harmed by them. Now the counter-revolutionaries have received their just desserts, and I have vented my anger. I must step up production and produce more grain to support national industrialization."

    The accounts that the members were most concerned about have now been reconciled household by household and made public. This made the members very satisfied. In the past, many members had opinions about the unclear accounts, but everyone did not know what was going on, and always thought that it was inevitable that things would be chaotic with so many people and accounts, and did not expect that counter-revolutionaries were causing trouble. Now that it has been clarified, everyone also knows how they were taken advantage of. The members all said that they must not be so negligent in the future. The accounts of our cooperative must be clear and accurate, and we must never let bad elements take the opportunity to carry out sabotage.

    The public property of the cooperative has also been sorted out and re-registered one by one. Everyone has a clear idea in their minds and cherishes this public property even more.

    The cooperative also held a meeting of all members' representatives, and re-defined and improved various systems of the cooperative. For example, there are new regulations for the financial system, the labor system, and the security system. In the past, one person was responsible for keeping money, grain, and agricultural tools, and managing expenses and income. Now, separate people are set up to manage each. In the past, the cooperative's expenses were relatively chaotic. Now, it has been re-stipulated that expenses within five yuan must be approved by the director of the cooperative, and expenses over five yuan must be approved by the members' representative meeting, so that the financial and custody systems have strict regulations. In terms of labor, the labor discipline of the members has also been re-established. The specific responsibilities of the cooperative's public security committee for protecting production and protecting public property have been stipulated.

    In terms of strengthening specific production measures, a plan has also been made to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, in accordance with the policy of developing a variety of economic crops in mountainous areas. This year, we also plan to use wasteland to grow vegetables, which can harvest 400,000 jin. Raise 150 pigs. In forestry, trees such as mountain peaches and mountain apricots have been planted that can increase the income of the members. On the cultivated land of the entire cooperative, it is planned that each mu of land will produce 28 jin more this year than last year.

    Now, the members are more united than ever. Everyone recognizes that unity is strength, and they all say that they will work under the leadership of the Party and the government to run the cooperative better. Member Song Jiaomei said: "This time I can hold my head up high. I said long ago that Zhang Bianze was not a good thing, but everyone didn't believe me. In the past, Zhang Bianze bullied me, and you kindly explained for him. This time, everyone can see the true face of this criminal, right? Now that I have vented my anger, I must produce well, produce more grain, and support industrial construction." Member Zhang Jucai said: "Fortunately, the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries were discovered early this time. If they had been discovered later, I don't know what the cooperative would have been turned into. I worked in the same group as Zhang Bianze, and he sabotaged unity in the group, causing losses to production, but at that time, everyone's vigilance was not enough and they did not recognize his reactionary face. Now we can see him clearly. We must be more vigilant and strengthen the unity between the members in the future." Member Song Jinshan said: "If we are not united, we will create opportunities for the enemy to carry out sabotage."

    Shen Jilan told me: This time, many women in the cooperative stood at the forefront and carried out a resolute struggle against the counter-revolutionaries. Women Han Chunlan, Zhou Chunlian, and Zhang Yinze all came forward as witnesses and cited the sabotage facts of the counter-revolutionary criminals. Even the old woman Zhang Fuqiao, who usually did not talk much, rushed to listen to the trial when the counter-revolutionaries were publicly tried. She said: "This time I must listen carefully, and I can't be so confused in the future."

    Li Shunda told me: Now, not only is everyone's production enthusiasm very high in the cooperative, but also their political awareness has been improved and their vigilance has been strengthened. The members are full of confidence in production. When he came to Beijing to attend the meeting, the members cordially entrusted him to tell everyone about the situation in the cooperative after the removal of the counter-revolutionaries. Because they know that everyone cares about the growth of the Golden Star Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative. Now they are determined to strengthen unity, work hard to consolidate and develop the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry cooperative, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production, to respond to everyone's care and support for national construction.

    清除了反革命分子以后的金星农林牧生产合作社
    本报记者　柏生
    在全国人民代表大会召开期间，记者访问了全国人民代表大会代表、山西省平顺县西沟乡金星农林牧生产合作社社长李顺达和副社长申纪兰，请他们谈了一下金星农林牧生产合作社在清除了反革命分子张来全和张扁则以后的情况。
    李顺达首先对我说：这次事件使我们受到很深刻的教训。过去我到苏联参观时，也听到过苏联同志讲过，在集体化愈高度发展时，阶级斗争就会愈尖锐愈复杂。苏联搞集体化运动时，也曾不断发生富农破坏集体农庄的事件。因此我在思想上是知道反革命分子要破坏我们的合作化运动的。可是为什么在西沟乡我们社里却没有能够防止反革命分子的破坏呢？这主要是我们眼睛不亮，在实际斗争中不善于辨别好人和坏人，在政治上麻痹，失掉了应有的警惕。一九五一年冬天我们合作社刚成立时，反革命分子张来全和张扁则就假装积极进步，钻进了社里，并且先后骗取了劳动组长和会计的职务，取得了进行破坏活动的有利条件。当时我们虽然也知道这两个反革命分子历史上有过反革命的事实，但是总以为他们经过政府的宽大处理和教育，已经改过自新了。加上他们能写会算、能说会道，我就觉得他们对我们还有用，忽略了他们进行破坏的可能，结果就在斗争中吃了他们的亏。
    李顺达和申纪兰都认为这一事件给予他们自己和全社社员的教育是极为深刻的。这事件给大家敲响了警钟，使大家深深地认识到，随着合作化事业的迅速发展，农村的阶级斗争不是缓和了，而是日益复杂化和尖锐化了。那些已被消灭的和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，对于农业生产合作化运动的破坏是必然要日益加剧的。我们任何微小的麻痹大意都会给敌人造成进行破坏的机会。
    谈到这里，李顺达更进一步说：“在互助合作运动发展过程中，人越多、社越大，阶级的警惕性就越要提高，注意用阶级观点来观察和分析各种问题。在我们社这次发生的反革命分子破坏事件中，我就犯了阶级观点模糊的错误。过去我总以为经过土地改革和生产运动，农村已经中农化了，富农经济已经因为受到限制而衰落下来了。因此觉得农村里的阶级斗争好像是缓和了。这种认识是十分错误的。今后从我自己来说，首先就是要提高思想认识和革命警惕性，加强对农业社的政治领导，认真贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线，这样才能在工作中不犯错误，使我们的合作化事业顺利发展。”
    李顺达和申纪兰告诉我，金星农林牧生产合作社在揭露和清除了反革命分子张来全和张扁则以后，现在各方面的情况都有了好转。过去遗留下来的许多问题，一一解决了。这使社员们的心里感到非常痛快，干起活来也更加起劲了。例如过去反革命分子张来全利用会计职权，私吞了贫农社员路文全的工资米，又改了路文全分得粮食的账，致使路文全应得的粮食被克扣了六百斤。现在社里已经补给了路文全二百五十斤粮食，其余数目折钱补给了他。得到这样的处理，路文全非常满意而且感动。他说：“要不是共产党、人民政府眼睛亮，铲除了这些反革命分子，我全家都要叫他们给坑害了。现在反革命分子得了应得的下场，我这口气也出了，我一定要加紧生产，多打粮食，支援国家工业化。”
    社员们最关心的账目，现在也挨家对清，公布出来了。这使社员们非常满意，过去许多社员对账目不清有意见，可是大家认不清是怎么回事，总以为人多账乱是免不了的，没有想到是反革命分子在捣乱。这回弄清了，大家也知道了是怎么吃的亏。社员们都说以后可不能再这样麻痹大意了，咱们社里的账一定要弄得清清楚楚地，绝不让坏分子乘机破坏。
    社里的公共财产也一一清理从新登记了。大家心里有了数，更加爱护这些公共财产了。
    社里还召开了一次全社社员代表大会，把社里的各种制度从新作了明确规定，健全起来。例如财务制度，劳动制度，保卫制度等，都有了新的规定。过去保管钱、粮和农具，管理开支和收入都是一个人，现在分别各设一人来管理了。过去社里开支比较混乱，现在从新规定：开支五元以内的要经过社长批准，五元以上的由社员代表大会批准，使财务、保管制度都有了严格的规定。在劳动方面，也从新健全了社员的劳动纪律。对社内的治安保卫委员会，规定了保卫生产、保护公共财产的具体职责。
    在加强生产的具体措施上，也根据山区发展多种经济作物的方针，作了全面发展农、林、牧生产的计划。今年还准备利用荒坡小地种蔬菜，可收四十万斤。养猪一百五十口。林业上，种植了能够增加社员收入的山桃山杏等树木。在全社耕地上，计划每亩地今年要比去年增产二十八斤。
    现在，社员们团结得更加紧密了，大家都认识了团结就是力量，都表示要在党和政府的领导下，把合作社办得更好。社员宋交梅说：“这回我可抬起头来了。我早就说张扁则不是个好东西，大家不信。以前张扁则欺侮我，你们还好意地替他解释。这回大家可看清了这罪犯的真面貌了吧。现在我这口气出了，我一定要好好生产，多打粮食，支援工业建设。”社员张居财说：“这回对反革命分子的破坏活动幸亏发现的早，如果发现晚了，不知道要把合作社搞成什么样子。我和张扁则在一个小组里劳动，他在小组里破坏团结，使生产受到损失，但那时大家的警惕性都不够，没认清他的反动面目，现在可把他看清了。以后一定得提高警惕，加强社员之间的团结。”社员宋金山说：“咱们自己要不团结，就会给敌人造成破坏的机会。”
    申纪兰告诉我：这次社里许多妇女都站在最前面同反革命分子进行坚决的斗争。妇女韩春兰、周春莲、张印则都出来做证人，举出了反革命罪犯的破坏事实，就连平日不大说话的张富乔老大娘，在公审反革命分子时也赶来听审判。她说：“这回一定要听听，往后可不能再这样糊涂了。”
    李顺达告诉我：现在社里不仅大家生产情绪很高，而且政治觉悟也提高了，警惕性也加强了，社员们对生产充满了信心。当他来北京开会时，社员们亲切地嘱托他，要把社里清除反革命分子以后的情形告诉大家。因为他们知道大家都很关心金星农林牧生产合作社的成长。现在他们决心用加强团结，努力巩固和发展农林牧生产合作社，争取农业生产的丰收，来回答大家的关怀和支援国家建设。
