Many graduating students from universities in Shanghai, Nanjing, Fujian, Dalian, and other regions are actively preparing to participate in the construction of the motherland's interior and border regions.

After reading Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," many students in graduating classes at Shanghai Jiaotong University held discussion meetings. Many expressed at the meetings their desire to dedicate their youth and strength to the country's construction in the interior and border regions. Many graduates from East China Normal University, Tongji University, Fudan University, and other schools have requested school leaders to help them realize their ideals of participating in construction in the interior. Sun Zhenming and 23 other graduates from the Music Department's specialized course at East China Normal University recently returned home to mobilize their relatives to support their aspirations and made preparations for their long journey. Thirteen graduates from the Railway Construction Specialized Course at Tongji University asked the president to help them realize their desire to participate in railway construction in the Northwest. Some graduates from the Department of Water Conservancy and Soil Improvement and the Department of River and Hydraulic Engineering Construction at East China Institute of Water Conservancy hope to participate in water conservancy construction in the border regions or in the work of harnessing the Yellow River. Zhang Xingqi and seven other graduates from the Forestry Management major at Fujian Agricultural College hope to go to the border regions to develop green treasures. Some graduates from the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Xiamen University expressed their willingness to contribute everything they have learned to the cultural undertakings of the border regions.

Many graduates from the Civil Engineering Department of Dalian Institute of Technology wrote letters to relevant departments of the central government, requesting permission to be assigned to work in the border regions. Communist Youth League members Jiang Guotai, Wang Kang, and others wrote in a letter to the person in charge of the Ministry of Higher Education: "We know that the working and living conditions in Tibet may be more difficult, but all difficulties can be overcome by us. We plan to settle down there and dedicate our lives to the construction of the motherland's border regions." (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海等地高等学校许多毕业生准备参加祖国内地边疆建设
    上海、南京、福建、旅大等地区的许多高等学校应届毕业生积极准备参加祖国内地和边疆的建设事业。
    上海交通大学许多毕业班学生在读了国务院副总理李富春“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”后，都举行了座谈会，很多人在会上表示要把自己的青春和力量，贡献给国家在内地和边疆的建设。华东师范大学、同济大学、复旦大学等校许多毕业生都要求学校领导方面帮助他们实现到内地参加建设的理想。华东师范大学音乐系专修科毕业生孙振明等二十三人最近还回家动员他们的亲属支持他们的愿望，并作了远行的准备工作。同济大学铁路建筑专修科十三名毕业生要求校长帮助他们实现到西北参加铁路建设的愿望。华东水利学院水利土壤改良系和河川水工建筑系部分毕业生希望参加边疆水利建设或参加治理黄河的工作。福建农学院森林经营专业毕业生张兴其等七人希望到边疆去开发绿色宝藏。厦门大学中国语言文学系部分毕业生表示愿意把他们学到的一切贡献给边疆的文化事业。
    大连工学院土木工程系的不少毕业生写信给中央有关部门，要求允许把他们分配到边疆去工作。青年团员姜国泰、王康等在给高等教育部负责人的信中写道：“我们知道西藏的工作条件和生活条件都可能比较艰苦，但是一切困难都是能够被我们克服的。我们打算在那里定居下来，为建设祖国边疆而献出自己毕生精力。”　（新华社）
