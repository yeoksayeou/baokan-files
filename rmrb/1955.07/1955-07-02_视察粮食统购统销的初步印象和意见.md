    Greeting the Second Session of the First National People's Congress
    Preliminary Impressions and Opinions on Inspecting the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain
　　Li Shucheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    On May 10th, Comrade Xu Guangping, Comrade Niu Peicong, and several staff members from government departments and I went to Hunan's lake area, a severely affected disaster area, Hubei's lightly affected disaster area, and Henan's cotton-producing area to inspect the unified purchase and sale of grain. Within twenty-five days, we gained a preliminary understanding of the grain work in eight counties, seventeen districts, and twenty townships.

    The concept we obtained in Xiangyin and Yueyang counties, in the severely affected disaster area of Xiangdong Lake Region, was: grain supply is guaranteed, significant achievements have been made in production and disaster relief, the lives of disaster victims are no worse than those in non-disaster areas, and in some individual places are better than those in non-disaster areas. Some impoverished households are even better off than before the disaster. No signs of disaster can be seen in the disaster area.

    Yueyang County has a disaster-affected population of 80,420. The average daily grain supply in the disaster area is twelve ounces of rice per person. During the Spring Festival, an additional ten pounds of rice were supplied per person, and during the spring plowing season, an additional forty-six pounds of rice were supplied per laborer, which is generally sufficient to eat. According to statistics from Xiangyin County's Fourteenth District (a severely affected disaster area), from August of last year to June of this year, the state supplied a total of 14,850,000 catties of grain (including various subsidies), plus 473,000 catties of sweet potato threads, sweet potato flakes, and broken rice. The district has a population of 50,000, averaging 27.8 catties of grain per person per month. If we add the 2,000,000 catties of vegetables produced by the disaster victims themselves, the average is more than 31 catties of raw grain per person per month. In addition, this year the government also loaned 920,000 catties of grain seeds and 383,552 yuan in loans to farmers, and distributed 393,464 yuan in relief funds. Due to the above measures by the government, the enthusiasm of the disaster victims for production is very high. They are not only able to eat their fill, but most of them have also built houses. They are particularly supportive of the unified purchase and sale of grain. They believe that the government has given them "three gives and five distributions" (three gives are: cooperatives provide manure, non-disaster areas provide rice straw, and the government provides firewood; five distributions are: distribution of grain, distribution of relief funds, distribution of loans, distribution of winter clothing, and distribution of wages for repairing dikes). We did not see any beggars in the lake disaster areas of Xiangyin and Yueyang counties, and as far as we know, there were no cases of starvation. The children we saw in the disaster area were generally healthy, the women's clothes were generally neat, and we did not see anyone with a hungry look on their faces. According to our understanding, the situation in the disaster areas of Hubei is roughly the same.

    The state is fully responsible for supplying grain to the disaster victims in the severely affected disaster areas of the three provinces, which is an unprecedented initiative in Chinese history, and the work is very arduous and great. Hubei Province alone transferred 1.4 billion catties of grain from eighteen provinces. Therefore, the people in the disaster areas are sincerely grateful to the government.

    In the vast majority of areas we passed through, the unified purchase and sale of grain work is good and normal, the cadres are working hard, and the masses support the unified purchase and sale of grain policy, especially after the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, the masses' enthusiasm for production is even higher.

    The unified purchase and sale work in various places is generally carried out in conjunction. It is implemented on the basis of mobilizing the masses and carrying out democratic appraisal, finalizing the plan with three public announcements, and publicizing the amount of grain sold by the unified purchase households and the amount of grain purchased by the unified sale households. As a result of doing this simultaneously, the purchase and sale figures are mostly close to the actual situation, and the peasants are satisfied. Hubei peasants reflect that the unified purchase and sale of grain work is improving year by year, the "four retentions" in 1954 were better than the method in 1953, and this year's "three fix" is even better than last year's "four retentions." The reasons why the peasants in various places are satisfied with the unified purchase and sale policy are: first, it guarantees the supply of grain; second, prices are stable; and third, the quality of grain is good, without adulteration or counterfeiting. In addition, the peasants in the cotton-producing areas are also very satisfied with the current ratio of cotton to grain prices. Many peasants in the disaster areas reflect that this year there has been no selling of green crops, no mortgaging of fields, and even less selling of children. This is mainly due to the benefits of unified purchase and sale and the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The high enthusiasm for production among the masses in various places this year is not only closely related to the "three fix" policy for grain, but also inseparable from the close ties between grassroots cadres and the masses and their active work. Among the approximately 200 district and township staff members and activists we contacted, the vast majority seem to be very good. They are familiar with the situation, enthusiastic, simple, hard-working, caring about the lives of the masses, and pure and lovely. Some people say that "the work style of grassroots cadres of the People's Government is generally not good." This statement is unfair. Among the seventeen districts we passed through this time, only the grain supply method in Sandian District, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, was unreasonable. The masses had to go to the district every day to buy the day's grain, and the amount of grain that each person could buy each day was different, and sometimes they could not buy it at all, which was extremely unsatisfactory to the local masses. We have suggested to the local government that they immediately start improving the grain supply method. The situation in the other sixteen districts is relatively normal.

    In April of this year, some abnormal phenomena occurred in the grain supply in some areas. The main problems were: supplies were given to those who should not have been supplied, and supplies were oversupplied to those who should have been supplied less, and there were also cases where supplies were not provided in a timely manner to those who should have been supplied. According to statistics from the Henan Provincial People's Committee on 412,944 households in the province, the number of households that were supplied but should not have been supplied or that were oversupplied when they should have been supplied less accounted for 19.26 percent of the total number of households. In Chendawan Village, Huangpi, Hubei, those who were supplied but should not have been supplied and those who were oversupplied when they should have been supplied less accounted for 55 percent of the unified sales households in the village. As for the households that should have been supplied but were not supplied in a timely manner, the number was relatively small. According to statistics from Henan on 1,013,789 households in the province, it only accounted for 6 percent; in the Eighth District of Suntian Township, Xianning, Hubei, it only accounted for 4.8 percent, in Dajiaowan Village, Huangpi, it only accounted for 2.3 percent, and in Ta'er Township, Xiaogan, it was less than 1 percent. Why did the phenomenon of tight grain supply occur? The reason is that households that were truly short of grain demanded grain supply, and households with surplus grain, especially households with surplus grain that had not been thoroughly purchased, were afraid of being asked to sell grain again, so they deliberately said they were short of grain; some self-sufficient households also blindly demanded supply; plus, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries incited them from within, thus creating an atmosphere of tight grain supply. However, after rectifying unified sales, mobilizing the masses, conducting evaluations, and clarifying the boundaries between surplus and shortage, this group of "grain-short households" who could not distinguish between true and false were sifted through, and the number was greatly reduced. Before the rectification of unified sales in Hebian Huang Village, Ta'er Township, Xiaogan, Hubei, 52 households requested supply, needing 21,635 catties of grain. After the rectification of unified sales, only 26 households truly needed supply, needing only 6,410 catties of grain, a decrease of more than 70 percent compared to the original amount of grain requested. Heping Township, Lingbao, Henan, originally requested an increase in supply of 5,000 catties, but after in-depth work, not only was there no need to increase the supply, but also 2,586 catties of surplus grain were sold.

    The number of households truly short of grain in some areas did increase in the first half of this year, which is inseparable from some problems existing in our work. It can be explained in three categories.

    The first category: Due to lack of experience, there were two loopholes in the unified purchase and sale work in the past: First, the circulating grain and the unified sale grain were not clearly distinguished. Circulating households bought back grain from the state in the first half of this year, which increased the amount of grain supplied in the first half of this year; second, some areas purchased "excessive grain" from individual households. According to our understanding, only a very small number of people were forced to complete the grain purchase task or cadres and activists took the lead in doing too much. The vast majority of cases were due to a lack of understanding of the yield of the land, or the land quality was the same, but the farming techniques and labor diligence were different, resulting in a few households being assessed with high yields and low grain retention.

    The second category: Many areas suffered severe droughts in the autumn of last year and excessive ice and snow in the winter, resulting in serious losses of late rice, beans, potatoes, and vegetables, so that some self-sufficient households became grain-short households, and the amount of grain shortage for grain-short households increased, so the originally assessed grain supply was not enough to eat. This is one of the main reasons for the increase in the number of grain-short households in many areas this spring. Some areas underestimated this situation and failed to replenish sales in a timely manner, thus forming a passive situation.

    The third category: There was not enough prior understanding of population increases, movements, and other various types of special grain use situations. Even if there was understanding, there was a lack of appropriate solutions, so the problems were delayed, accumulating over time, and small problems became big problems, and the problems of a few people developed into the problems of many people. Of course, there are also some wasteful or unreasonable situations, which should be treated differently.

    Now it seems that it was a bit late to rectify the unified sales work in April of this year. If this work could have been carried out in February, the grain supply situation in some areas might have been better. In addition, the lack of a complete system of grain coupons and the failure to carry out publicity and education on saving grain in urban and rural areas in a timely manner have all contributed to the chaotic phenomenon in the unified grain sales work for a time, causing the state to sell more grain.

    Preliminary opinions on improving grain purchase and sale methods:

    First, if various localities calculate circulating grain and supply grain separately; reduce the phenomenon of selling "excessive grain"; reduce supplies to those who should not be supplied; reduce waste of grain; gradually bring special grain use into line, so that there is a system to follow; and conscientiously do a good job in adjusting the state grain market, so that households with surplus grain can sell grain without worry, and households short of grain can purchase a limited amount of grain from households with surplus grain, without completely relying on state supply. If these tasks can be done well, according to rough estimates, in general years, grain purchases can be reduced by about 5 percent, and grain sales in grain-producing areas can be compressed by about 40 percent, and in cash crop areas by about 20 percent.

    Second, according to preliminary understanding, if the grain tax that self-sufficient households and grain-short households should pay is changed to payment in lieu of money or converted to cash crops, then the supply area can be reduced by about 10 percent. In this way, the public grain levy will be reduced by only about 5 percent, which will not have a great impact on the amount of public grain, but will greatly facilitate the work.

    Third, farmers in various places are very dissatisfied with the high fixed amount of grain and edible oil supplied to cities, and urban residents are also uneasy. The fixed amount of grain and edible oil supplied to cities should be appropriately reduced.

    Fourth, in view of the extremely unstable production situation of China's small-scale peasant economy and the constantly changing grain supply situation, in addition to treating grain purchase and sale work as the central task for a certain period during the grain purchase period, party and government leaders in various places should preferably make the inspection and adjustment of grain supply work a temporary central task every February in order to take the initiative.

    Fifth, the current grain year is from July 1 of the current year to the end of June of the following year. Due to the production season, it has a certain impact on the front-end looseness and back-end tightness of the grain supply, and it is inconsistent with the national other planning years. In the future, we should actively prepare the conditions to change the existing grain year so that it is consistent with the national economic planning year.

    Sixth, peasants in some areas have a lot of opinions on the adjustment of grain varieties. Farmers in Hunan and Henan who are close to mountainous areas ask to eat coarse grains, and farmers in Hubei who are close to cities ask to eat rice and are unwilling to eat wheat and barley. Therefore, farmers should be educated to "eat what they have"; at the same time, in addition to strengthening the variety adjustment work of the national grain market, the grain departments in various places should also do their best to actively improve this work.

    Seventh, the vast majority of district and township staff members we have seen understand the policies and can also work hard and endure hardship in their work. However, some district and township staff members are sometimes inexperienced, have a rigid attitude, and their working methods are inevitably simplistic, and even a few individuals engage in corruption and violate laws and regulations. Therefore, in the future, we should strengthen the education of district and township staff members, help them improve their work ability, and improve their working methods. In addition, because we have not conducted in-depth and systematic socialist propaganda and education among the peasant masses, some problems cannot be resolved in a timely and effective manner; strengthening socialist propaganda and education work among the peasant masses is of great significance.

    迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议
    视察粮食统购统销的初步印象和意见
　　全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员　李书城
    我于五月十日和许广平同志、牛佩琮同志同政府部门几位工作人员赴湖南滨湖重灾区、湖北轻灾区和河南棉产区视察粮食统购统销情况。在二十五天时间内，对八个县、十七个区、二十个乡的粮食工作，作了初步的了解。
    在湘东滨湖重灾区的湘阴和岳阳两县所得到的概念是：粮食保证供应，生产救灾成绩很大，灾民生活不比非灾区差，个别地方比非灾区好，某些贫苦户比受灾前好，灾区内看不到灾象。
    岳阳县受灾人口八万零四百二十人，灾区粮食供应每人平均每日大米十二两，春节每人补销大米十斤，春耕期间每一劳动力补销大米四十六斤，故一般够吃。据湘阴县十四区（重灾区）统计，从去年八月到今年六月，国家共统销粮（包括各种补助粮）一千四百八十五万斤，另补红薯丝、红薯片和碎米共四十七万三千斤。全区五万人口，每人每月合粮食二十七点八斤；如果再加灾民自己生产的蔬菜二百万斤，每人每月就合原粮三十一斤多了。另外，今年政府还贷给农民九十二万斤谷种、三十八万三千五百五十二元贷款，发救济款三十九万三千四百六十四元。由于政府的上述措施，灾民生产情绪十分高涨，他们不仅吃得饱，且绝大部分连房屋也盖起来了。他们对粮食统购统销特别拥护。他们认为政府对他们是“三给五发”（三给是：合作社给粪草、非灾区给稻草、政府给柴草；五发是：发粮食、发救济款、发贷款、发寒衣、发修堤工资）。我们在湘阴、岳阳两县的滨湖灾区没有看见讨饭的，据了解也没有饿死人的现象。我们在灾区见到的小孩一般是健康的，妇女的衣服一般是整齐的，看不到面有饥色的人。据了解，湖北灾区情况也大体相同。
    三个省的重灾区灾民的口粮全部由国家负责供应，在我国历史上是空前未有的创举，工作十分艰巨伟大。仅湖北一省国家即从十八个省调入了十四亿斤粮食。因此，灾区人民对政府是真诚感激的。
    在我们所经过的绝大多数地区，粮食统购统销工作是好的，正常的，干部是努力工作的，群众对粮食统购统销政策是拥护的，尤其在粮食“三定”政策贯彻后，群众的生产积极性更为高涨。
    各地统购统销工作一般是结合进行的，是在发动群众的基础上实行民主评议，三榜定案，公布统购户卖粮数量和统销户的买粮数量。这样同时作的结果，购销数字大部接近实际情况，农民满意。湖北农民反映粮食统购统销工作一年比一年进步，一九五四年的“四留”比一九五三年的办法好，今年的“三定”比去年的“四留”更好。各地农民对统购统销政策满意的原因：一是保证了粮食供应；二是物价稳定；三是粮食质量好，没有掺杂掺假。此外，棉产区的农民对现在的棉粮比价也很满意。许多灾区的农民反映：今年没有卖青苗的，没有兑田的，更没有卖儿女的，这主要是统购统销和发展互助合作的好处。今年各地群众生产积极性的高涨，不仅和粮食“三定”政策有密切关系，和各地基层干部的联系群众、积极工作也是分不开的。我们所接触的区乡工作人员和积极分子约二百人，其中绝大多数看来是很好的。他们熟悉情况，热情积极，朴素艰苦，关心群众生活，纯朴可爱。有人说“人民政府的基层干部作风一般不好”。这种说法是不公平的。我们这次经过的十七个区中，只有湖北新洲县的三店区粮食供应办法不合理，要群众每天去选区购买当天的粮食，每人每天所能购到的粮食数量不一样，有时还购不到手，极为当地群众所不满。我们已建议当地政府，即日着手改进粮食供应办法。其他十六个区的情况都是比较正常的。
    今年四月在部分地区粮食供应发生了一些不正常的现象，主要问题在于：不该供应的供应了、该少供应的多供应了，也有该供应而未及时供应的情况。据河南省人民委员会对全省四十一万二千九百四十四户的统计，不该供应而供应和该少供应而多供应的户数占总户数的百分之十九点二十六。湖北黄陂陈大湾村不该供应而供应和该少供应而多供应的占该村统销户的百分之五十五。至于该供应而未及时供应的户则为数较少，据河南对全省一百零一万三千七百八十九户的统计，只占百分之六；湖北咸宁孙田乡八选区只占百分之四点八，黄陂大教湾村只占百分之二点三，孝感塔儿乡则不足百分之一。为什么会发生粮食供应紧张现象呢？原因是真正缺粮户要求粮食供应，余粮户、特别是统购不彻底的余粮户害怕叫他们再卖粮食，就故意说缺粮；部分自足户也跟着盲目要求供应；再加上地主、富农、反革命分子从中煽动，这样就造成了一种粮食供应紧张的空气。但在整顿统销以后，经过发动群众，进行评比，划清余缺界线，这一伙真假不分的“缺粮户”，才去假存真，人数大大减少下来。湖北孝感塔儿乡河边黄村在整顿统销前，要求供应者五十二户，需粮二万一千六百三十五斤，经过整顿统销后，真正需要供应的只二十六户，需粮只六千四百一十斤，比原来要求供应的粮数减少百分之七十强。河南灵宝和平乡原要求增加供应五千斤，经过深入工作后，不仅不需要增加供应，且又卖出余粮二千五百八十六斤。
    某些地区今年上半年真正缺粮户数是有增加的，这是同我们工作中存在的一些问题分不开的。可分三类情况来加以说明。
    第一类情况：由于经验不足，过去在统购统销工作中，存在两个漏洞：一、是没有将周转粮和统销粮划分清楚，周转户在今年前半年向国家买回粮食，增加了今年前半年的粮食供应数量；二、是若干地区购了个别户的“过头粮”。据我们了解，由于勉强完成购粮任务或干部和积极分子带过头的只占极少数，绝大多数是由于对土地的产量不摸底，或土地质量相同但耕作技术和劳作勤惰不同，致使少数户评产偏高，留粮偏低。
    第二类情况：不少地区去年秋季干旱，冬季冰雪过大，晚稻、豆类、薯类及蔬菜遭受严重损失，以致若干自足户变为缺粮户，缺粮户缺粮的数量增多，这样原评供应的粮食就不够吃了。这是不少地区今春缺粮户增多的主要原因之一。部分地区对此情况估计不足，未及时补销，因而形成被动。
    第三类情况：是对人口增加、移动及其他种类繁多的特殊用粮情况，事先了解不多，即使了解，也因缺乏妥善解决办法，使问题拖延下去，日积月累，小问题变成大问题，少数人的问题发展成为多数人的问题。当然，其中也有些浪费或不合理的情况，这是应该区别对待的。
    现在看来，今年到四月才整顿统销工作，在时间上是迟了些；如果能在二月进行这项工作，若干地区的粮食供应情况，可能会更好一些。此外，粮食证票缺乏一套完整的制度，对城乡节约粮食的宣传教育进行得不及时，这都促成了一时的粮食统销工作中的混乱现象的发生，使国家多销了粮食。
    改进粮食购、销办法的初步意见：
    一、各地如将周转粮同供应粮分别计算；减少卖“过头粮”的现象；减少不应该供应的供应；减少粮食的浪费；把特殊用粮逐渐纳入正轨，使有制度可循；并认真作好国家粮食市场的调剂工作，使余粮户卖粮无顾虑，缺粮户可向余粮户购买有限度的粮食，不完全靠国家供应。如能做好这些工作，根据粗略的推算，一般年景，粮食收购量可减少百分之五左右，粮食销量粮产区可压缩百分之四十左右，经济作物区可压缩百分之二十左右。
    二、据初步了解，如把自足户和缺粮户应缴的公粮改征代金或折征经济作物，那末供应面就可缩减百分之十左右。这样，少征公粮只百分之五左右，影响公粮数量不大，对工作便利不少。
    三、各地农民对城市粮食、食油的供应定量偏高，甚为不满，城市居民亦感不安。应对城市粮食、食油的供应定量加以适当压缩。
    四、鉴于我国小农经济生产情况极不稳定和粮食供应情况变化多端，各地党政领导干部除在粮食统购期间应以粮食购销工作作为一定时期的中心任务外，最好于每年二月把检查和调整粮食供应工作做为临时的一件中心工作，以争取主动。
    五、现在的粮食年度是从当年七月一日至下年六月底，由于生产季节关系，对粮食供应的前松后紧有一定影响，且和国家其他计划年度不一致。今后似可积极准备条件，将现有粮食年度加以改变，使同国民经济计划年度一致。
    六、部分地区农民对粮食品种调剂颇有意见。湖南、河南靠近山区的农民要求吃杂粮，湖北靠近城市的农民要求吃大米，不愿吃小麦、大麦。因此，对农民应进行“有啥吃啥”的教育；同时，除加强国家粮食市场的品种调剂工作外，各地粮食部门亦应尽力之所及，积极改进这一工作。
    七、我们所见到的绝大多数的区乡工作人员都了解政策，工作中也能任劳任怨。但部分区乡工作人员有时由于经验不足，态度生硬，工作方法不免简单化，甚至有个别人营私舞弊，违反法纪。因此，今后应加强对区乡工作人员的教育，帮助他们提高工作能力，改进工作方法。此外，由于我们对农民群众进行深入的、系统的社会主义宣传教育不够，以致有些问题不能得到及时有效的解决；加强对农民群众的社会主义宣传教育工作，是有重大意义的。
