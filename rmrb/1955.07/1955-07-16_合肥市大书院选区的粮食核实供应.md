    Grain Verification and Supply in Hefei's Da Shuyuan Electoral District
    By our reporter Yu Ming
    Rectifying the urban grain unified sales work and verifying supply according to population is a good way to plug loopholes in grain waste and save grain. The implementation of grain verification and supply in the Da Shuyuan electoral district of Hefei City, Anhui Province, has achieved initial results.
    The Da Shuyuan electoral district in Hefei City's West District has a total of 252 households. The original supply was 30,194.5 jin per month, with an average supply of slightly over 30.3 jin per person per month. After this rectification, the monthly supply is 20,636 jin, a reduction of 9,558.5 jin compared to the original supply. After verification, an average of just over 21.2 jin per person per month is sufficient.
    The grain supply in this electoral district has already undergone two rectifications, but because the principles of saving grain and rational supply were not well implemented, the supply remained large, and in some cases, the supply was irrationally increased during the rectification process. Grain was wasted in large quantities, while cadres and the masses believed that they had already "saved to the limit." As soon as the municipal party committee's work team arrived, the staff of this electoral district said that they had already rectified twice and that there was nothing more to be done. The masses said: It is the institutions and factories that waste grain; residents who manage their households carefully will not waste it.
    The municipal party committee's work team studied this situation and believed that the first step should be to raise the understanding of the staff. They first investigated the extent of grain waste in the electoral district and discovered many phenomena of grain waste. For example, Xu Chenggui, who ran a small stall, had four adults and two children in his family and requested 180 jin of grain per month. In reality, from January to May, his family only bought an average of 120 jin per month. Even this amount of grain was not consumed, as he had also accumulated some glutinous rice. During the Dragon Boat Festival in May, he borrowed three grain purchase certificates from relatives and neighbors and bought 40 jin of glutinous rice, which, together with his accumulated rice, he made into more than 900 zongzi for sale. A carpenter shop had six workers and five family members and needed to purchase 500 jin of grain per month. The boss often gave the uneaten rice to his relatives in the countryside. According to investigations, he sent 60 jin of rice to the countryside from April to early June. A tile worker named Chen Maohai purchased 60 jin of grain per month, which he could not eat himself, so he supplied it to three people who came from the countryside, while these people still had a grain supply in the countryside. These unreasonable supply phenomena profoundly educated the grassroots staff in the electoral district.
    Based on this understanding, the municipal party committee's work team further encouraged them to examine their own household's grain purchase situation and conducted patriotic education for them, explaining the impact of grain waste on national construction. The results of the inspection showed that out of the 26 grassroots staff in the entire electoral district, 15 families only needed to supply 30 to 40 jin of grain per person on average. The surplus grain was either eaten by relatives and friends who came from the countryside, fed to pigeons, or made into snacks. After calculating according to the actual needs of the population, many staff members voluntarily reduced the amount they requested for supply. In the past, they felt that their quotas were high, and they were "lame and soft-tongued" and embarrassed to speak to the masses. Now that their own quotas have been reduced, they are actively conducting propaganda and education among the masses.
    The work team and the grassroots staff of the electoral district also jointly convened women's meetings, youth meetings, and workers' meetings to conduct propaganda and education, making them active propagandists for saving grain. At the same time, through group mobilization and team deliberation, the masses' awareness gradually improved. Then, many evaluation groups were organized to set quotas according to the actual population of each household. Under the leadership of the staff, each evaluation group conducted evaluations and individual consultations. Finally, it was passed at a democratic evaluation meeting. In this way, everyone felt it was fair and reasonable. Facts have proved that, on the basis of raising the ideological level of the masses, based on the actual situation, allowing the masses to propose the supply amount themselves, and then having the masses evaluate it, there is not only less resistance and quicker resolution of problems, but also the final supply amount can be greatly reduced.
    After this rectification of the unified grain sales work, the residents of the Da Shuyuan electoral district in Hefei City are all paying attention to saving grain, and many people are studying ways to improve cooking methods. Xu Zhangge's family, a resident, improved the method of washing rice, putting the washed rice aside for a while before putting it in the pot to cook. In this way, the rice absorbs more water, the amount of cooked rice increases, and cooking three jin of rice produces one more bowl of rice than cooking it immediately after washing. The cooked rice also tastes very good. His family of four uses this method to cook rice and uses one jin less rice per day than before.

### 合肥市大书院选区的粮食核实供应

    合肥市大书院选区的粮食核实供应
    本报记者　于明
    整顿城市粮食统销工作，按人口核实供应，是堵塞浪费粮食漏洞和节约粮食的好办法。安徽省合肥市西市区大书院选区实行粮食核实供应获得了初步成绩。
    合肥市西市区大书院选区共二百五十二户，原供应量每月三万零一百九十四斤半，平均每人每月要供应三十斤三两强。经过这次整顿，每月供应二万零六百三十六斤，较原供应量减少了九千五百五十八斤半；经核实后平均每人每月只供应二十一斤二两多就够了。
    这一选区的粮食供应，已经过两次整顿，但是因为没有很好贯彻节约粮食、合理供应的原则，供应量仍然很大，有的在整顿中反而不合理地增加了供应量。粮食大量浪费，而干部和群众却以为已经“节约到顶”了。市委工作组刚一来到，这个选区的工作人员就说，已经整顿两次了，再没有什么搞头了。群众则说：浪费粮食的是机关和工厂，居民当家过日子的人不会有浪费。
    市委工作组研究了这种情况，认为首先应该提高工作人员的认识。他们先摸了选区中浪费粮食的底，发现了很多浪费粮食的现象。如摆小摊的许成贵家四个成年人，两个小孩，每月要求供应一百八十斤粮食。实际他家从一月至五月，平均每月只买一百二十斤。就这些粮食也吃不完，因为他还积存了部分糯米。在五月节，他又借了亲戚和邻居的三个购粮证买了四十斤糯米，和自己积存的米，做成了九百多个粽子出卖。一个木匠铺有六个工人，五个家属，每月要购粮食五百斤，老板经常把吃不完的米挑给乡下的亲属吃。经查出的，四月到六月初他就送到乡下六十斤米。有一个瓦匠工人陈茂海每月购买粮食六十斤，自己吃不了，供给从乡下来的三个人，而这些人在乡下照样有粮食供应。这些供应不合理的现象深刻地教育了选区的基层工作人员。
    在这种认识的基础上，市委工作组进一步启发他们检查自己家里购粮的情况，并对他们进行爱国主义教育，讲清浪费粮食对国家建设的影响。检查结果全选区基层工作人员二十六人，就有十五家平均每人都只要供应粮食三十斤到四十斤。多余的粮食有的被乡下来的亲友吃掉了，有的喂了鸽子，有的则把一些粮食做成零食吃掉了。经过按人口实际需要计算以后，许多工作人员都自动把要求供应的数量减下来了。过去他们觉得自己定量高，“腿瘸舌头软”不好向群众开口。现在自己的定量降下来了，就积极向群众进行宣传教育。
    工作组和选区基层工作人员又共同召开了妇女会、青年会和工人会，向他们进行宣传教育，使他们成为节约粮食的积极宣传者。同时经过大组动员、小组酝酿，使群众的觉悟逐步提高。接着又组织了许多评议小组，按照每家实际人口分等定量。各评议小组在工作人员领导下，一面进行评议，一面进行个别协商，最后在民主评议大会上通过。这样大家都觉得公平合理。事实证明，在群众思想提高的基础上，根据实际情况，由群众自行提出供应量，再经群众评议，不但阻力少，解决问题快，而且最后的供应数量是可以大大降低的。
    合肥市大书院选区的居民，在这次整顿粮食统销工作以后，家家都注意节约粮食，许多人在研究改进煮饭的方法。居民许章格家改进淘米的方法，把淘过的米放一个时候再下锅煮，这样米吸收的水分多、出饭数量增加，煮三斤米，比过去淘米后立刻下锅煮要多出一碗饭，这样煮出的饭也很好吃。他家四口人，用这个办法煮饭，每天比过去要少用一斤米。
