    Underground Coal Car Safety Signal Indicator
    Wang Jianzhi
    In the deep underground mines of the Fushun Laohutai Mine, hundreds and thousands of tons of coal extracted from the coal mining face are loaded onto coal cars and transported to the surface through winding, spiderweb-like tunnels. Then, the coal cars carry timber, tools, and mechanical equipment used underground back down. Coal cars on the mine's transportation lines are constantly running back and forth.

    Due to the many lines and complex intersections, coupled with the noise of the mine's motors and the sound of blasting rocks and coal, it is often difficult for coal car drivers and hook-up workers to understand the driving conditions of vehicles ahead, which can easily lead to accidents and affect the mine's safe production.

    In order to solve this problem, transportation worker Ma Mingjin researched and developed an underground coal car driving safety signal indicator. The indicator has a simple structure, containing a red light, a green light, and a warning bell. It is installed at intersections of various lanes. When a coal car convoy is driving on the main roadway, drivers and hook-up workers can see the signal and know whether there are vehicles ahead or not, and whether the switches ahead have been properly set. Since the installation of this signal indicator, derailments and collisions in this mine's transportation work have been basically eliminated, ensuring safe transportation and increasing coal car operating efficiency by one time.

    井下煤车安全信号指示器
    王建之
    在抚顺老虎台矿深达几百公尺的地下矿井里，从采煤掌子开采出来的千百吨煤炭，都要装在煤车上、经过弯弯曲曲像蜘蛛网一样的巷道运到地面上来；然后煤车又把载满着井下使用的木材、工具、机械设备运下去。矿井运输线上的煤车，终日川流不息地奔驶着。
    由于线路多，交岔道复杂，加上矿井的马达声，岩石、煤炭的爆破声响成一片，往往使煤车司机和登钩工人难以了解前面车辆的行驶情况，很容易发生事故，影响矿井的安全生产。
    运输工人马明金为了解决这个问题，研究出一种井下煤车行驶的安全信号指示器。这个指示器的构造简单，里边放有红灯、绿灯和一个警铃，装置在各车道交岔的地方，当煤车行列在大巷道行驶的时候，司机和登钩工看到信号就可以知道前面是有车或者没车，前边的道岔是否已经搬好。自从装设了这个信号指示器以后，这个矿井中的运输工作基本上消灭了掉道和撞车事故，保证了安全运输，并且提高了煤车运转效率一倍。
