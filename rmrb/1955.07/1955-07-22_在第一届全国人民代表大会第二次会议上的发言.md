Our congress has listened to the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on "The First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development," Vice Premier Li Xiannian on "The National Budget for 1954 and the National Budget for 1955," Vice Premier Peng Dehuai on "The Draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," and Vice Premier Deng Zihui on "The Comprehensive Plan for Controlling the Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Resources." We have also had ample opportunities for discussion. We all feel that our country has made excellent progress in socialist construction, and through discussions, we have had a comprehensive and concrete study of the flexible application of Marxism-Leninism. We express our heartfelt gratitude.

I personally work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. From a scientific perspective, I believe that these reports are crystallizations of rich and correct knowledge from natural and social sciences, embodying Marxism-Leninism. I not only fully agree with these important reports but also am willing to work wholeheartedly with all representatives and with the people of the entire nation to promote patriotism and internationalism, practice thrift, and oppose waste. We will strive to complete and surpass the plans and tasks outlined in these reports.

I would like to especially thank Vice Premier Li Fuchun for emphasizing the crucial issue of cultivating scientific and technological talent. Vice Premier Li said, "The lack of scientific and technological talent is obviously a major obstacle in our progress. One of the major political tasks we must complete in the first and second five-year plans is to cultivate a large number of engineers and technicians who are loyal to the motherland and to the cause of socialism, who possess modern scientific knowledge, skilled workers, and various types of specialized talent." This is completely correct. The "various types of specialized talent" mentioned here undoubtedly refers to relatively high-level experts in various scientific and technological fields.

China's scientific and technological achievements have a long and glorious history. The world knows that the three great inventions of the modern era—the compass, gunpowder, and printing—are the results of our ancestors' scientific research. However, due to the long-term stagnation of feudal society and the cultural aggression of imperialism, China's modern science is particularly backward. The scientific heritage we inherited from the Kuomintang era is very meager, with few people and imbalanced development. Many important sciences are still blank today. The existing scientific knowledge has not been adequately valued, and there are rich scientific and technological treasures in agriculture, crafts, and medicine that await our discovery, improvement, and promotion. Therefore, in the cause of socialist construction, we particularly feel the acute shortage of scientific and technological talent.

To build a socialist society and to make the country a highly modernized industrial nation, it is difficult to achieve the goal without a solid foundation in natural and technological sciences and a powerful scientific force. Modern industry promotes the continuous progress of science, and modern science also promotes the continuous development of industry; the two are interdependent. In the past five years, our country's construction has achieved tremendous success. We must not forget that this is thanks to the great, selfless help from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union not only provided comprehensive and systematic assistance in material equipment but also sent a large number of excellent scientific and technological experts to support our construction. Vice Premier Li Fuchun mentioned this in his report, saying, "Our important achievements in economic construction are inseparable from the help of Soviet experts." This is the case in economic construction, and it is also the case in cultural and educational construction and other areas.

But we must also remember that the Soviet Union sent a large number of experts to support us, not because they had too many people and nothing to do, but because they were drawn from the busy positions of communist construction. To build socialism and communism, the work is only getting more intense day by day, and the need for high-level talent is only increasing. The situation of having too many people will never occur. Here, we should particularly recognize the great selflessness of Soviet aid! But we cannot rely solely on Soviet aid without creating our own conditions. If we did that, we would become a huge burden on the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we have not taken such a disheartening path. While relying on Soviet aid, we are also actively creating our own conditions. Therefore, cultivating various levels and types of scientific and technological talent has become "one of the major political tasks we must complete in the first and second five-year plans."

Currently, China's relatively high-level scientific talent is extremely scarce. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, the Academy has forty-one research institutions, but there are only over three hundred senior researchers at the level of associate researcher or higher. Among them, there are indeed many with high academic standards, but compared to the grand scale of national construction, they are still extremely scarce. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is making the cultivation of new forces one of its central tasks. This is an urgent and long-term task that we cannot afford to neglect. Generally, the cultivation of a relatively high-level scientific talent, after graduating from university, requires continuous study and at least another five to ten years. Our first five-year plan has been underway for half of its duration, and we hope that during the implementation of the second or third five-year plan, the new forces cultivated by the Academy can stand on the construction front lines.

Here, the experience of the Soviet Union has given us great encouragement. At the time of the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the entire Russian Academy of Sciences had only one hundred fifty-four researchers. After 1929, the Soviet Union began to systematically cultivate young scientific cadres within the Academy. By 1941, the number of researchers in the Soviet Academy of Sciences had reached ten thousand, an increase of sixty-four times in just over ten years. Currently, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has approximately twenty thousand researchers, double the number in 1941. Including the Soviet Academy of Sciences, there are currently about three thousand scientific research institutions in the entire Soviet Union, with over one hundred thousand researchers. This is incomparable to our current situation, but this is precisely the glorious vision that we must and can achieve in the not-too-distant future.

But to achieve such a glorious vision, we must follow the path that the Soviet Union has already opened for us. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a meeting to establish departments, following the Soviet model, dividing the Academy into four departments: Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry; Biology and Earth Sciences; Technical Sciences; and Philosophy and Social Sciences. Two hundred thirty-three scientists were elected as departmental committee members, approved by the State Council. We will use this departmental leadership method to plan and organize China's scientific endeavors based on the long-term plan for socialist construction and to accelerate the cultivation of new scientific and technological forces. This work, in socialist construction, is one of the key issues. We believe that relying solely on the efforts of a single institution like the Chinese Academy of Sciences is not enough. Like the entire national construction endeavor, it must be led by the Party, relying on the support and supervision of governments at all levels, people's congresses at all levels, and the entire people, to complete the task.

The cultivation of relatively high-level specialized talent is different from the cultivation under the school system. This mainly involves adopting the apprenticeship method, which cannot be mass-produced. According to general experience, one expert should ideally lead five or six apprentices; too many would be difficult to manage. Seeing that the cultivation of high-level talent cannot be mass-produced and also takes a long time, we should cherish those who can take apprentices even more. Those who can do teaching work are not necessarily able to conduct research work; those who can conduct research work are not necessarily able to take apprentices. Those who can take apprentices are even more scarce in China today. Therefore, we must pay special attention to their reasonable use. Vice Premier Li Fuchun also mentioned the "problem of the reasonable use of scientific and technological personnel" in his report, clearly pointing out, "Any waste of technical strength is a loss to national construction." We fully support Vice Premier Li's directive. Currently, the phenomenon of the unreasonable use of scientific and technological talent is indeed quite serious. Many specialized talents are used in administrative work, and even more are not using their specialized skills, or we can say that specialized talents are being used universally. For example, at a time when we are accelerating the research on atomic energy, we still have several nuclear physicists teaching general physics in schools. Scientific talent is scarce, and if it is not used reasonably, this should be more alarming than the "Great Roof" and "Geological Palace" and other luxurious buildings! Because it does not attract much attention, its loss is not easily measured in monetary terms. Therefore, we sincerely request that in all units, for scholars who have the ability to conduct research, they should be allowed to have time to conduct academic research as much as possible. If possible, we sincerely request that they be allowed to participate in the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is not considering the immediate interests of a single unit but considering the long-term interests of the nation. The national construction endeavor is progressing at a rapid pace, theory must be linked with practice, and the continuously advancing practice also requires continuously advancing theoretical research to be linked. Without continuously advancing theoretical research, even school teaching work will stagnate, let alone other construction endeavors.

We believe that the national scientific talent should be and can be allocated comprehensively. Scientists, if they participate in the work of the Academy, are not necessarily limited to being the Academy's people; they are still the nation's precious talent. The Academy is the national Academy. Its work must serve the people. It must serve production and construction, serve national defense construction, serve educational endeavors, serve medical endeavors, and serve all national construction endeavors. Any department or unit can reasonably use it. Any department or unit also has the necessity to support and strengthen it, to make it capable in the great national construction endeavor. To make the Academy capable in the national construction endeavor, I must say again, it is urgent to concentrate considerable strength on cultivating new forces at present. Other research institutions of any department, although their businesses may differ in scope, are also national institutions and should similarly take the cultivation of new forces as their central task. To guarantee national construction and peace, we must have a powerful defense army, and we must also have a powerful scientific army. If this scientific force is not established in time and is not established strongly enough, it will be difficult to imagine the future socialist and communist construction plans of increasing scale being successfully completed step by step.

Of course, under the current circumstances, we may have to make excessive demands on scientists. With few people, important skills, and urgent national needs, scientists may be required to do the work of more than one person. The saying "the capable work more" is something we believe scientists will feel the honor of. The nation particularly values scientists, for example, among the representatives of the National People's Congress, according to our incomplete statistics, there are one hundred eighty-four scientists, of which one hundred three are departmental committee members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The tasks are heavy, so how can we do the work better? We believe this is a problem that scientists with a sense of responsibility universally feel. To solve this problem, we believe the best way is to study Marxism-Leninism more diligently and to master the worldview of dialectical and historical materialism. This will give us the correct stance, viewpoint, and method, improve our work efficiency, and protect us from being infiltrated by bourgeois idealist thoughts and taking the wrong path. Such study, of course, must be voluntary, but if we can continuously strengthen such study, it will be better.

Marxism-Leninism reveals the laws of development of natural and social phenomena to us and gives us methods to further reveal and apply them to transform nature and society. After learning this truth that is universally applicable, our research and application of natural and social sciences will naturally achieve twice the results with half the effort. Theory need not be said much, indisputable facts are the best evidence. Soviet science is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and in just over thirty years, it has reached the peak of scientific development and has become an indispensable pillar of communist construction. The victory of the Chinese revolution is also the result of the great material force formed by the combination of Marxism-Leninism and Chinese revolutionary practice. These indisputable great facts are concrete lessons for us. Therefore, studying Marxism-Leninism more diligently and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is particularly necessary for us, who currently have so few scientific and technological workers.

Marxism-Leninism, in terms of logic, is the easiest thing to learn because it is a true reflection. Anything true is the easiest to understand. The younger generation learns Marxism-Leninism very quickly, which is clear evidence. Older people may find it difficult, which is due to our old prejudices playing tricks. One space cannot contain two objects. Old thoughts stubbornly occupy our minds, leaving no room for new thoughts. If among our friends, someone feels indifferent and finds it difficult to learn Marxism-Leninism, I seriously say, that is a sign of illness. Do not let that feeling develop. That is the gap that the enemy, lurking around us, is looking for. Be vigilant, for there may be a Hu Feng among us, preparing to sneak into our livers like a blood-sucking leech. We are the glorious citizens of the People's Republic of China and are also the scientific and technological workers specially valued by the nation. We have a sacred duty, together with the people of the entire nation, to complete the great task of socialist construction. We must eliminate all possible Hu Fengs and quickly transform our thoughts, blocking up any possible gaps in ourselves!

Is there any secret to blocking such gaps?

Yes. That is what we all know: "Study, study, and study again!"

Li Jishen, Vice Chairman, spoke:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on "The First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development" and the "Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development of the People's Republic of China"; I propose that our congress unanimously adopt this draft plan and hope that all representatives and the people of the entire nation will unite to ensure the implementation of this five-year plan.

I believe this plan fully complies with the requirements of the Constitution for the national tasks during the transitional period, is the specific method to achieve the national tasks during the transitional period, and reflects the common wishes and will of the Chinese people to build our great motherland. Only the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao could propose such a great plan, and only the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao can implement and complete this great plan! From the experience and achievements of the past two years, I, like all the representatives, have firm confidence in fully completing and surpassing the various indicators of this plan. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and at the same time, we should express our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, whose comprehensive, systematic, and selfless aid to us is of immense importance for us to implement the first five-year plan!

We thank the Soviet Union, so we should learn from the great internationalism of the Soviet Union, learn from the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction, and learn from the spirit of the Soviet people uniting as one, persevering, and striving to complete several five-year plans! We want to build our country into a great socialist nation, we must successfully complete this first five-year plan; to complete this great plan ahead of schedule, we must ensure the concrete implementation of each regulation in the plan. Therefore, each relevant department or designated unit should, according to their responsibilities, formulate effective implementation methods based on the indicators specified in the plan and implement them thoroughly. For example, as mentioned in the third item of the third paragraph of the measures to achieve the agricultural production plan, each locality should widely collect animal bones to produce bone meal to increase the supply of fertilizer. If the government does not specify a concrete method for collecting animal bones, making every slaughterhouse and household across the country able to save, collect, and utilize the bones of pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. every day, that regulation will not achieve the maximum results. If a concrete implementation method is specified, a considerable amount of bone meal raw material can be obtained. According to the figures listed in the commercial circulation volume of the plan for the annual supply of pork, the average for five years is calculated to be 307.8 ten thousand tons per year. If the proportion of bones is calculated to be 15% of the meat, there will be 46.17 ten thousand tons of bones per year. If we add the bones of cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks, which are about one-third of pig bones, we will have 61.56 ten thousand tons per year. If one-third of this is lost in households and cannot be collected, 20.52 ten thousand tons of bone meal raw material will be lost each year. I think the planning organs of the government and various business departments must have more detailed implementation methods for the various regulations in the five-year plan. I am only pointing out that we should recognize the importance of every sentence in the plan and hope to achieve the goals with concrete methods. The wisdom and strength of the six hundred million people of our nation are boundless. As long as everyone is mobilized, according to the regulations of the plan, contributes their strength, we will definitely be able to strive to complete this great plan ahead of schedule!

To build socialism and complete the five-year plan, we must oppose waste and practice thrift to accumulate funds and increase wealth. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, "Currently, there are still very serious waste phenomena in some aspects, some departments, some places, and some enterprises." Such wasteful behavior is contrary to the path of implementing the five-year plan. The Central Committee of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly pointed out the importance of increasing production and practicing thrift. Frugality is a traditional virtue of the Chinese people. The experience of the Soviet Union also clearly tells us that to build socialism, we must strictly practice thrift. I fully agree with the policies and methods proposed by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian in their reports on practicing thrift and opposing waste. For the happiness of generations to come, I believe we should make practicing thrift and opposing waste a long-term political task for the entire nation, so that everyone can recognize from their thoughts that waste is shameful and criminal, and unite to wage an unrelenting struggle against wasteful phenomena!

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on "The National Budget for 1954 and the National Budget for 1955." In the 1955 national budget, the expenditure on economic construction and cultural and educational expenses reaches 60.67% of the annual expenditure, fully embodying the policy of key construction and reflecting the wishes of the people of the entire nation to engage in peaceful construction. However, we know that American imperialism is still insisting on its "policy of strength," still intensifying the establishment of military bases in various places and around our country, and still occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan. To defend our socialist construction, defend Asian and world peace, resist aggression, and liberate Taiwan, we must continue to strengthen our national defense forces. I believe that the defense expenditure, which accounts for 24.19% of the annual expenditure in this year's budget, is necessary and completely reasonable. Implementing the 1955 national budget will further develop our national economy, further improve and elevate the cultural and material lives of the people, and further strengthen and consolidate our national defense forces. Governments at all levels and all departments must firmly grasp every link of income and expenditure to strive for the complete implementation of the 1955 national budget!

Implementing the compulsory military service system is a major step for us to quickly establish a powerful modernized armed force and to gradually accumulate a powerful reserve of soldiers. I fully agree with Vice Premier Peng Dehuai's report on "The Draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China." We know that after the draft of the revised military service law was published, the people of the entire nation unanimously expressed enthusiastic support, and the broad masses of young people responded even more enthusiastically to the call of the motherland, eagerly volunteering to join the army, as Vice Premier Peng Dehuai mentioned in his report, with countless moving examples. I propose that after the congress adopts this draft as law, all representatives should conduct more extensive and in-depth propaganda, so that the people of the entire nation can understand that serving in the military is a glorious duty and a sacred right of our people.

In this congress, what excites me the most is the plan to control the Yellow River, which has been a major disaster for thousands of years and has not been tamed. This plan is magnificent, unprecedented in our country's history, and rare in the world. Our ancient saying goes, "When a sage appears, the Yellow River clears." The muddy Yellow River, which has been a disaster for thousands of years, will be permanently clear and will forever benefit the people after the implementation of this control plan. This makes me deeply feel that with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, even natural disasters that have never been conquered in history can be overcome by us.

Representatives, when I speak here, my heart is truly filled with inexplicable excitement and agitation. Before us lies a bright and distant road, which is the road to a great socialist society. We are now doing the great deeds that our predecessors could not do. Our cause is extremely glorious, but it is also very arduous, and it is what our enemies dislike the most. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident and other counter-revolutionary activities fully show that internal and external enemies are using every means to sabotage our cause. They will never willingly perish, so we must be a hundred times more vigilant, prevent all sabotage by the enemy, and must severely suppress and eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. We, the democratic parties, must be more closely united around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, firmly support the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the united front, strengthen ideological remolding, criticize all backward and erroneous thoughts brought from the old society, work hard, contribute strength, strengthen the struggle against internal and external enemies, and strive with the people of the entire nation to complete the great cause of fully and surpassingly completing the first five-year plan!

Meng Tai, Representative, spoke:

I am very happy to participate in the second session of the first National People's Congress this time.

I am a pipe fitter who has worked for thirty-eight years and has suffered from the pain of Japanese oppression for more than ten years. Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, in 1948, the people of Anshan were liberated. The blast furnaces were in the hands of the working class, and I was truly overjoyed. Some Japanese technicians said, "Your blast furnaces cannot produce iron, they can only grow sorghum." We were determined to repair the blast furnaces. At that time, there were no tools or materials, so we all went to the scrap iron pile to find parts and materials. Under the leadership of the Party, we overcame all difficulties and repaired the blast furnaces. To maintain the blast furnaces, for several years, I went to check the blast furnaces every day, early in the morning and late at night. If I did not check them personally and touch our pipes, I could not sleep.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, with the help of the Soviet government and the guidance of Soviet experts, as well as the support of the people of the entire nation, we repaired the old blast furnaces, improved production, increased output, and built many new blast furnaces, such as the eighth, seventh, sixth, and fifth blast furnaces. These blast furnaces are great, all automated.

At this congress, I listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I was extremely happy to hear that the nation will build so many factories. Anshan Steel will become a factory with an annual production of 250 ten thousand tons of pig iron, 322 ten thousand tons of steel, and 248 ten thousand tons of steel products. I was overjoyed and my spirit was even higher. This truly realizes the hope of the working class. At this congress, I also listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Deng Zihui and Peng Dehuai, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen. I fully agree with and enthusiastically support these reports.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the guidance of Soviet experts and the support of the people of the entire nation, the glorious task of building Anshan Steel, we will definitely complete, and we will surpass the plan. I will go back and prepare to do this.

First, this year, our factory has formulated a production and thrift competition plan. The original plan was for two of our blast furnaces to undergo major repairs, but after discussion, as long as we strengthen equipment maintenance, these two blast furnaces will not need major repairs this year, and production will not be affected at all. We can produce an additional 110 thousand tons of pig iron for the nation, and we will also produce an additional 40 thousand tons of pig iron. After I go back, I will definitely unite the masses, go deep into the masses, and complete this competition plan.

Second, all employees of Anshan Steel will definitely complete the task of saving 75 million yuan in the second half of this year. In the past, our management system was not strict, and there were still many wasteful places. In the future, we will calculate carefully in our work, practice thrift, and do a good job of team economic accounting to reduce costs.

Third, we will definitely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, promote advanced experience, and propose more rationalization suggestions.

Fourth, I will definitely be a good people's representative, bring the spirit of the congress back, convey it to the employees, listen to everyone's opinions, reflect them to the government, and strengthen the connection with the masses.

All representatives! Let us unite, support each other, increase production, oppose waste, practice thrift, complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the nation, and strive to complete the first five-year plan!

Li Dachang, Representative, spoke:

I fully agree with the draft of the first five-year plan for national economic development and the report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council. To ensure the implementation of the five-year plan, I will now speak on two issues: the need to severely punish counter-revolutionary elements and the need to insist on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

(1)

The implementation of the five-year plan will not only greatly develop socialist industrial construction in our country, significantly increase the proportion of socialist elements in the entire national economy, and significantly reduce the proportion of non-socialist economic elements, but it will also make the people's democratic dictatorship, with the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the base, and national defense construction more consolidated. All of these are victories for the people and are also failures for American imperialism and its running dogs, the traitorous Kuomintang regime, and all enemies of the people. However, to implement the five-year plan, we must engage in a more complex, sharper, and deeper struggle than the past anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. Because the enemies of the Chinese people will not willingly die, they will definitely use every means to sabotage our five-year plan. Taking Sichuan as an example, Sichuan is the last place where imperialism and its running dogs, the traitorous Kuomintang regime, collapsed. Before and after their collapse, they left behind many Kuomintang spies. In the few years since liberation, through a series of democratic reforms such as bandit suppression, counter-revolutionary suppression, and land reform, we have given heavy blows to the enemies who were engaged in various sabotage activities at that time. The result of these heavy blows has played an important role in guaranteeing the safety of people's lives and property, establishing and maintaining social order, and the recovery and development of the provincial economy.

However, the Kuomintang spies who were not struck down in the past and have been lying low are now resurfacing and becoming arrogant again. The current targets of the enemy's sabotage are mainly aimed at our industrial construction, mutual aid cooperation movement, and the unified purchase and sale of grain, and they use various despicable and vile means. The methods the enemy uses to carry out sabotage activities are mainly to adopt more treacherous and more vicious infiltration and covert struggle methods. They often take advantage of certain weak links in our work, especially in some backward villages, remote mountain areas, and minority regions, taking advantage of certain shortcomings and errors in our work, or certain unhealthy situations in the ideological understanding and lifestyle of some cadres and workers, to seize the opportunity to carry out sabotage. Some engage in espionage and theft of our political, economic, military, and diplomatic intelligence, while others engage in assassination, bombing, arson, spreading rumors, creating incidents, and even inciting and organizing riots. For example, since 1953, the enemy has been captured and identified in our province, with fifty-six cases of spies and agents infiltrated by air and land. Criminal cases of hooligans, thieves, and bandits with counter-revolutionary backgrounds that disrupt social order are also increasing. What is particularly noteworthy is that the enemy's sabotage activities not only occur in various aspects of society but also use various disguises to infiltrate our basic construction, factories, mines, and financial, economic, and cultural departments, as well as grassroots political power organizations, and even infiltrate the Communist Party's organizations. In some of our factories, mines, enterprises, and agencies, due to impure organizations, there have been many cases of documents, telegrams, design drawings, and property being stolen and damaged. These facts can illustrate the serious situation of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Title: On the Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionaries and the Implementation of the Five-Year Plan

Page: 1

We know that the continuous victories in socialist construction and socialist transformation in various aspects will inevitably provoke resistance and sabotage from all remaining counter-revolutionaries and those staunchly opposed to the people within the classes that are about to be eliminated. However, some people have a serious problem with complacency and a lack of revolutionary vigilance, failing to see the enemy's sabotage activities, and thus unable to timely discover and severely strike the enemy. This is obviously a harmful thought stemming from an insufficient understanding of the enemy situation. Additionally, some people believe that landlords, rich peasants, or other counter-revolutionaries, although reactionary, are unarmed and thus cannot rebel. This is also a mistaken idea. Some people advocate only educating and reforming certain counter-revolutionaries and illegal landlords and rich peasants from an ideological standpoint, or advocating "lenient punishment for serious crimes," rather than punishing them according to the law based on their crimes. This will undoubtedly embolden the enemy's reactionary spirit and be detrimental to the cause of socialist construction.

Given the above situation, to better safeguard the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan, we must always remain vigilant, rely on the millions of laboring people, and continuously strengthen our public security work. We must resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. This struggle is not only necessary now but will also not weaken in the future. To thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, we must in the future closely combine the struggle against the enemy with the victorious advance of the Five-Year Plan. Any complacency or negligence will give the enemy an opportunity to sabotage, causing losses to our Five-Year Plan.

The policy of unified purchase and supply of grain is a major measure to ensure the socialist industrialization of the country and to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. From the implementation over the past two years, the unified purchase and supply of grain not only fully aligns with the current interests of the country, farmers, and all the people but also aligns with the long-term interests of the country, farmers, and all the people. Therefore, it is completely correct and timely. We must continue to implement this policy in our future work.

Sichuan is a grain-producing region with a surplus of grain. Moreover, since liberation, there have been no major disasters, and the harvest has been good every year. Given this situation, Sichuan should not only not face grain shortages but should also purchase more surplus grain to support national construction. However, why did some farmers in Wenjiang Special District face grain shortages last year, and why are some farmers in the districts of Fuling, Yibin, and Daxian facing grain shortages this year? Is it because we have purchased too much surplus grain from farmers? Or even bought the grain that farmers should keep for their own consumption? Is it because we have supplied too little, causing genuine grain-deficient households to be unable to buy grain? The facts prove that whether we look at the total grain production figures for the province, the scope and quantity of grain purchases, the "four retentions" given to farmers, or the scope and quantity of grain supply, Sichuan Province should not face grain shortages. Now let's look at some figures: In 1954, Sichuan's actual grain production was 375 billion jin, with purchases accounting for 37% (excluding tubers, which account for only 31.1% of the grain). On average, 169 jin were purchased per person. The supply quantity was 56.1 billion jin, of which 30.085 billion jin were supplied to rural areas, averaging 55 jin per person. If we calculate 100 jin per person for grain-deficient households, it can supply 30.85 million people, accounting for more than 55% of the agricultural population. The highest average percentage of grain-deficient households and "transient households" in the province is 45% (generally 30-40%), with each person supplied 100 jin of grain and turnover grain, the annual rural supply quantity needed is 25.1 billion jin, which can reduce the current actual supply quantity by nearly 5.7 billion jin. This shows that there are many loopholes and a lot of waste in rural grain supply. The urban grain supply situation is also full of loopholes and waste. The population of cities with more than 2,000 people in the province is approximately 6 million, and 25.25 billion jin were supplied, averaging 34.5 jin per person per month. This supply figure is large. If the supply is more reasonable, if the urban supply quantity is reduced by 1 jin per person per day, with 6 million urban residents, it can save 1.34 billion jin annually. Even after reducing the supply standard by 1 jin per person per day, the supply standard is still relatively high.

However, despite the above situation, there are still people in cities and rural areas facing grain shortages. One reason is that our work has flaws, such as in the unified purchase and assessment of production, due to insufficient investigation of production, resulting in some individual households being assessed too high or too low, or in supply, not supplying what should be supplied and supplying what should not be supplied. Another reason is that it reflects the contradiction between the collective and the individual, between socialist planned economy and small-scale peasant economy. This is the essence of the grain shortage problem. Moreover, some illegal landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionaries take advantage of the above contradictions and flaws in our work to spread rumors and incite the masses' dissatisfaction with the unified purchase and supply policy, which is an absolutely unacceptable criminal act. Due to the above reasons, we have drawn two conclusions regarding farmers' grain shortage problems: First, those who shout about grain shortages the loudest actually not only do not lack grain but also have surplus grain. Or some farmers shout "grain shortage," but what they actually lack is rice, not wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, etc. Second, those who do not seriously strengthen the education of farmers and the management of grain supply, and do not severely punish certain illegal landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionaries who take advantage of the situation to sabotage, but only adopt an official bureaucratic approach of supplying whoever shouts, the result is that the more supplied, the more they shout. Regarding the above situation, many cadres do not analyze and distinguish the fundamental causes of the problem but instead sympathize with or follow the shouting, which not only reflects the voices of some backward farmers but also shows that some people, after hearing the shouting, subjectively believe that the government has purchased too much grain from farmers and supplied too little, or believe that although the grain unified purchase and supply policy is correct, some cadres have made deviations in policy implementation and have not taken enough care of farmers' difficulties. This actually means that the Communist Party and the People's Government cannot represent the interests of farmers, while they represent the interests of farmers. This viewpoint and argument are obviously inconsistent with the actual situation, inconsistent with the grain unified purchase and supply policy, and inconsistent with the fundamental socialist interests of farmers. In reality, it is an attempt to delay or even not want our country's socialist industrialization.

To make our grain supply work better, to save more grain to support national needs, and to ensure the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan, we must continue to criticize and overcome some erroneous practices and thoughts regarding grain unified purchase and supply work. We must seriously rectify the supply work, especially we must fully implement the "three fixes" policy, so that farmers' production enthusiasm can be further stabilized and improved. For the grain supply problem of urban residents, we must also quickly and systematically adjust it, so that the grain supply in cities and rural areas can be more fairly and reasonably solved, which is of great significance for consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants and supporting national construction.

Sichuan Province is a major grain-producing area, and the grain supply situation is relatively abundant. However, due to the lack of understanding of the actual situation, some people have mistakenly believed that the unified purchase and supply of grain has led to grain shortages in some areas. This is not in line with the facts. The actual situation is that the unified purchase and supply of grain has not only ensured the needs of the state and the people but also promoted the development of agricultural production. The unified purchase and supply of grain is a major measure to ensure the socialist industrialization of the country and to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is completely correct and timely. We must continue to implement this policy in our future work.

The unified purchase and supply of grain has not only ensured the needs of the state and the people but also promoted the development of agricultural production. The unified purchase and supply of grain is a major measure to ensure the socialist industrialization of the country and to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is completely correct and timely. We must continue to implement this policy in our future work.

At this meeting, I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuqun's report on the "First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the "1954 National Budget and the 1955 National Budget," and Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report on the "Comprehensive Plan for Controlling Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Resources." These reports are about the great and glorious cause of seeking happiness for ourselves and our descendants. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, "We are doing what our predecessors have never done, a great and glorious cause." From these reports, we see the bright and magnificent prospect of our motherland gradually advancing towards socialism. This is the goal that the Chinese Communist Party has been striving for by leading the people. I hereby express my heartfelt support.

At the same time, we must see that while our country is engaged in peaceful construction and building socialism, the American imperialist aggressor group is doing everything it can to obstruct our people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan and is preparing to use a new large-scale war and threatening to use atomic weapons to threaten our country's security and the security of all humanity. The task of our armed forces is to defend the fruits of the people's revolution and national construction, to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state. We must especially be vigilant and, while concentrating our efforts on building socialism, we must also strengthen our national defense forces to defend our country's independence and world peace.

This conference, while reviewing the First Five-Year Plan, national budget and expenditure, and the plan for developing Yellow River water resources, also reviewed China's conscription law, making socialist economic construction and the defense of socialist national construction complementary. I fully support Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's report on the draft of the conscription law and request the conference to pass it for implementation.

Article 16 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: "Labor is the glorious duty of all citizens of the People's Republic of China who are capable of working." Article 103 states: "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China. Serving in the military according to the law is the glorious duty of citizens of the People's Republic of China." From this, we can see that every citizen of ours can gloriously build socialism and gloriously defend socialism, making production labor and defending the motherland complementary. In ancient China, there was the saying "arming the farmers." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in addition to having regular troops fighting, the laboring people in various liberated areas also engaged in production labor while holding weapons to defend the motherland. In the current Five-Year Plan, there is industrial construction, agricultural construction, and scientific and technological construction. Therefore, in addition to active duty, we have "arming the workers," "arming the farmers," and "arming the students." In this way, we can concentrate more manpower, material resources, and financial resources on socialist economic construction. At the same time, we also accumulate national defense forces to meet the needs of wartime national defense. According to the conscription law, we have both active duty and reserve duty. This not only has the core fighting force of active duty but also layers of reserve forces. The conscription law also regulates the enlistment and discharge in peacetime, mobilization in wartime, and demobilization after the war, all in an orderly manner, making it possible to combine production labor with defending the motherland. This is indeed a good conscription law.

Due to the emergence of atomic weapons and jet weapons, military science has developed new aspects. It is expected that future wars will be comprehensive, involving ground, naval, air, airborne, and anti-aircraft forces on land, at sea, and in the air. The breadth of the front, the number of troops, and the consumption of materials will all be greater than before. With national industrialization, there is a material foundation for modern national defense; with modern national defense, there is a guarantee for national industrialization. Now, the American imperialists are vigorously arming the Kuomintang bandits, on the one hand, carrying out military harassment, and on the other hand, carrying out political conspiracies. We must be highly vigilant against the imperialist aggressor group's plot to launch a new war, and we must be prepared for the suddenness of imperialist aggression, both materially and spiritually. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against us, we are confident that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, who have been tempered through long struggles, have the ability to defeat the imperialist aggressors and defend the country's security and territorial integrity.

During the 1954 conscription trial according to the compulsory military service system, the citizens of the whole country, especially the vast number of young people, after our explanation and propaganda, immediately supported the implementation of the compulsory military service system with practical actions. They said that the compulsory military service system is good, and when it is implemented, it will not affect national defense, production, or the future of young people. The vast number of young people clearly understand that building socialism is a glorious thing, and serving in the military is a sacred duty to defend the motherland's socialist construction. Although there are still some counter-revolutionaries engaging in sabotage activities such as spreading rumors, assassination, arson, and obstruction, the number of people who signed up still exceeded one million. These facts exceeded the expectations of some people.

After Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai reported on the "Draft of the Conscription Law of the People's Republic of China" at this meeting, according to the report in the July 18th issue of the People's Daily, workers, peasants, and students in Beijing were the first to enthusiastically support the implementation of the compulsory military service system. According to the experience of the trial implementation last year, as long as we conduct in-depth propaganda and education among the people, the implementation of the compulsory military service system will definitely gain the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people.

The source of military officers is partly from within the army and partly from outside the army, with higher education being particularly important. For reserve officers, we must conduct good registration and organize training. In recent years, many experienced soldiers who have returned to various construction work after demobilization are good officers and must be organized.

Regarding the training preparation issue: The principles and content of military training should be different according to the different types of service and the different occupations of individuals. Reserve personnel work in various departments such as industry, agriculture, transportation, and communications, and these should be combined with military needs and their business to conduct training, that is, to combine production technology training with national defense training, external military training with internal military training, that is, to combine rapid training with complete training, to combine the use of weapons training with military command training, and to combine political training with military training. Regarding the implementation of training, it should be organized and carried out by the relevant competent departments.

National organs and various departments of the national economy should, in their peacetime construction, consider how to serve the defense of the motherland in the event of war, so that when imperialist aggression suddenly strikes, we can put the political, economic, and cultural organizations of the entire country on a wartime track, meeting the requirements of wartime.

The active-duty soldiers of the People's Liberation Army should intensify military training and political study, heighten vigilance a hundredfold, and guard the sea, land, and air defenses to safeguard the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for national economic development.

After listening to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuqun and Li Xiannian on the Five-Year Plan and the national budget, I felt very excited and wholeheartedly support them.

The Five-Year Plan is a great plan to achieve socialist industrialization in our country. The realization of this plan will make the country gradually prosperous and the people gradually happy.

In the struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, our responsibility as farmers is to vigorously develop agricultural production, actively support industrial construction, and ensure the completion of the agricultural production plan.

To increase agricultural production, we must take the path of agricultural cooperatives. Only by organizing together can we rationally organize labor, rationally use land, gradually improve cultivation techniques, reduce agricultural production costs, reduce losses from natural disasters, and increase farmers' income. Take our Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative as an example. Although it was established in the spring of last year, it suffered severe waterlogging and pest damage in the summer and autumn; but due to the advantages of organization, not only did we overcome the disaster, but we also achieved a bumper harvest. In 1954, the average yield of rice in the cooperative was still 608 jin, an increase of 7% over 1953, 8.6% higher than the yield of mutual aid teams around us, and 10.6% higher than the yield of individual farming households.

Some people say that the cooperative's yield is higher than that of individual farming households, entirely due to the government's support for the cooperative. I don't know about other cooperatives, but in our cooperative, this is not the case. The government's help to our cooperative is indeed great, but the main aspect is still to rely on our own hard work and give full play to the various advantages of the cooperative. By the way, the cooperative is the direction of socialist transformation of agriculture, and the government's support for the cooperative is also appropriate. Some people say that the cooperative is good in every way, except for discriminating against individual farming households. In our cooperative, this is also not the case. In our cooperative, in seed soaking, seed replacement, water drainage, dike repair, and introducing advanced cultivation techniques, we pay great attention to helping or leading surrounding individual farming households to do so. Of course, if there is discrimination against individual farming households in the cooperative, it is not good and should be corrected.

I believe that our country's First Five-Year Plan is very good and completely achievable. The plan stipulates that the grain production plan will increase by 17.6% in five years. From the production situation of our cooperative, this target can be completed with a surplus. The grain production plan for our province will increase by 30% in five years, from an average yield of 545 jin per mu in 1952 to an average yield of 710 jin per mu in 1957. To ensure the completion of the above rice production increase target, we adopt the following main measures: (1) In cultivation techniques, we universally adopt methods such as "sparse sowing" and dense planting. The advantage of the "sparse sowing" method is that it can make the seedlings grow faster and stronger. The saying goes, "Good seedlings mean half the harvest." Strong seedlings mean half the hope of a good harvest. At the same time, each mu of land can save 3 to 4 jin of seeds. The dense planting method can increase the number of seedlings per mu from the previous 14,000 to 18,000 to 20,000; due to the uniform planting, land, fertilizer, etc., can be used more rationally, and sunlight can be more sufficient. In this way, the yield per mu can be increased by about 50 jin. (2) Strengthen field management work. Weeding is a very important agricultural task. Weeding is like suppressing counter-revolutionaries and must be done thoroughly and cleanly. Some people advocate weeding to achieve "three weeding and three hoeing," but weeding is not about the number of times, but mainly about doing it thoroughly. If the number of times is too many but not thorough, it will harm the growth of the seedlings. (3) In terms of increasing fertilizer and rational irrigation, we plan to allocate part of the land in the cooperative to plant red clover, vegetables, melons, and sweet potatoes to solve the problem of pig feed, and accumulate sufficient manure and green manure. Last year, we also made more than 2,000 dan of water grass, 195 dan of wild grass, caught more than 17,000 jin of earthworms, solved the problem of top dressing for more than 400 mu of land, dug more than 20 rivers, and shoveled river mud to solve the problem of base fertilizer for more than 100 mu of land. We plan to adopt the above methods to solve about two-thirds of the total fertilizer with manure, and one-third with green manure and phosphate fertilizer. Fertilizer is very important for increasing production, but it must be used appropriately. Applying fertilizer and irrigating water is like people eating and drinking, neither can be done without, nor can it be done excessively. Some people think that the more fertilizer is applied, the more production will increase, which is not entirely correct. If too much fertilizer is applied, it is like eating too much, not only is it not beneficial but also harmful. Some people think that if less fertilizer is applied, it will reduce production, which is also not entirely correct. If the fertilizer is less, but attention is paid to the critical moments of the crop's growth, such as tillering, heading, and grain filling, to apply it in a timely and appropriate manner, the rice will still grow well. The depth of irrigation water for crops is also very important for their growth. (4) In terms of seed selection, seed retention, and variety improvement, we not only require the selection of sufficient seeds but also require the use of fine selection methods to make the seed purity reach more than 98%; at the same time, reduce the planting area of early rice and glutinous rice within the cooperative, turning low-yielding into high-yielding. (5) Pest control, waterlogging prevention, and drought prevention are very important for agricultural production, especially the prevention and control of borers. We plan to reduce the borer rate through seedling field moth capture, egg collection, and field borer control. Due to the advantages shown in various aspects by organizing together, plus the above agricultural production increase measures, we have full confidence and determination to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national agricultural production increase plan.

Finally, agricultural cooperativization is inseparable from the unified purchase and supply of grain. In the past two years, we farmers have deeply felt that only by implementing the unified purchase and supply of grain can prices be stabilized, we will no longer be exploited by rich peasants and profiteers, the countryside will no longer go back to the old road, farmers' production enthusiasm will be high, and the cooperative will be more consolidated. However, some people seem to be speaking for us farmers, deliberately distorting facts, and reversing right and wrong, saying that the unified purchase and supply of grain is so bad, farmers' lives are so difficult, etc., but in fact, they are opposing socialism. We farmers clearly know that we have obtained liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party in the past, and now only by continuing to follow the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely taking the path of cooperativization can we walk towards the bright and happy road of socialism. We must also heighten our vigilance and resolutely prevent and eliminate counter-revolutionary sabotage, so as to ensure the victory of socialism in our country.

The First Five-Year Plan is a great plan to lead our country towards the goal of industrialization and socialism, making our country prosperous and the people happy. I enthusiastically support this plan. We private industrialists and businessmen should correctly play our role in the First Five-Year Plan, make a certain contribution to the Five-Year Plan, and strive with the people of the whole country to achieve the complete realization of this plan.

First, private industrialists and businessmen should see from the rapid progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation that the direction of their future efforts. The First Five-Year Plan is implemented on the basis of the restoration of the national economy and is formulated according to the requirements of the general task of the transitional period. In the past two years, we have achieved brilliant results in all aspects. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an indispensable part of the First Five-Year Plan. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party and the people's government have correctly implemented the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and have accumulated a lot of valuable experience in gradually implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In recent years, under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and the people's government, the ideological awakening of many private industrialists and businessmen has improved, and they have gradually understood that the two opposing production relations of socialism and capitalism cannot coexist peacefully in one country, and that taking the socialist path is the inevitable law of historical development of our country. However, the socialist transformation should be carried out under the leadership of the socialist economy, according to the current actual situation, and adopt feasible measures to gradually realize it. Therefore, under the current political and economic conditions of our country, it is necessary and possible for capitalist industry and commerce to gradually enter the track of state capitalism through joint state-private operations, processing and commissioning, agency sales, etc. in the next five years, laying the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. The First Five-Year Plan carefully arranges the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and at the same time requires capitalists to abide by state laws, accept transformation. Private industrialists and businessmen should carefully understand its spirit and essence, obey the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state economy, abide by the state plan, accept the supervision of the working masses, and honestly go through various forms of state capitalism to actively accept socialist transformation. Only in this way can we meet the expectations of the state and the broad masses of the people. We private industrialists and businessmen should strive in this direction, and the future is bright. We should be excited and enthusiastic about it.

Second, private industrialists and businessmen should strive to give full play to their production and management enthusiasm and take practical actions to respond to the government's planned arrangements. Since the government implemented the policy of overall arrangement and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, most private industrialists and businessmen have actively improved production and management with a grateful heart. However, some private industrialists and businessmen have insufficient understanding of the policy of combining arrangement with transformation, emphasizing the aspect of care, ignoring the aspect of transformation; or emphasizing the aspect of equal treatment, ignoring the aspect of differentiation; or emphasizing the aspect of local difficulties, ignoring the aspect of overall care; and thus have erroneous ideas such as "raw materials rely on the state, funds rely on the bank, production relies on workers, and the market relies on state-owned enterprises" or "state-owned enterprises do wholesale, private businesses do retail, division of labor, each gets what they deserve," etc. It must be pointed out that these erroneous ideas are harmful to socialist construction and socialist transformation. Private industrialists and businessmen should understand that socialist construction and socialist transformation are a process of arduous struggle. In the process of socialist transformation, it is difficult to completely avoid some difficulties in production and management, but these are temporary, partial, and can be overcome. After overcoming some difficulties, new difficulties will inevitably arise. If we do not take the initiative and enthusiasm, rely solely on the government, or ignore the difficulties of the state economy, and make too many demands for care, some problems that can be solved by ourselves will not be solved, which will increase the degree of difficulty and the obstacles to overcoming difficulties. This is not beneficial to the country or to oneself. Therefore, we must establish confidence, correct the passive and dependent mentality, and under the state's policy of comprehensive consideration, strive to overcome difficulties, actively rectify enterprises, improve management, actively respond to the government's planned arrangements.

Third, private industrialists and businessmen should increase production, practice economy, and further promote enterprise transformation. Since private industry and commerce are an integral part of the national economy and most of them are under the leadership of the state economy and have already entered the track of state capitalism, they all have the responsibility to contribute a certain force in the First Five-Year Plan. Private industry can go through the increase production and economy movement, not only to complete the tasks entrusted by the state on time, in quantity, and in quality, but also to save raw materials, improve product quality, reduce production costs, and at the same time, promote the improvement of enterprise management and production technology, creating conditions for joint state-private operations. Private commerce can also improve management by seriously carrying out the economy movement, save operating costs, expand commodity circulation, and better serve consumers. Most importantly, private industrialists and businessmen can learn more new things in the increase production and economy movement to replace some capitalist management methods and styles. This movement itself is a vivid and content-rich practical education, and the results of its implementation can also make a certain contribution to the accumulation of funds for national economic construction. In addition, we should actively complete the bond payment task in the bond work, which is a practical action to support national economic construction.

Fourth, private industrialists and businessmen should improve their political awareness and combine enterprise transformation with personal ideological transformation. Today, private industrialists and businessmen can play a positive role in the national economy and also have a certain political position, which means they have political responsibilities. We know that the ultimate goal of personal transformation is to become a citizen of a socialist society, so we should look far ahead, learn humbly, and improve our political awareness and ideological understanding. Private industrialists and businessmen should overcome the idea and behavior of only caring about themselves and not about society, only caring about the present and not about the future, only caring about personal consumption and not about social production, and resolutely fight against those who sabotage production, withdraw funds, harm workers, and spread various reactionary rumors to resist transformation. Private industrialists and businessmen should not avoid or fear transformation, but should bravely join the ranks of accepting transformation. Especially in the current struggle to thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries, this is our current political test. Private industrialists and businessmen should not be indifferent and stay out of it, but should study documents actively, join the struggle, and should also correct their own shortcomings, plug loopholes, and prevent all hidden counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging. We should enhance our patriotism, arouse revolutionary enthusiasm, further eliminate the idea of not distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, further improve our political vigilance and sense of responsibility, unanimously condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and strive for the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country.

Comrades, private industrialists and businessmen! Chairman Mao Zedong said, "We are doing what our predecessors have never done, a great and glorious cause." With the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us, on the basis of ensuring the unshakable focus on the development of heavy industry, the First Five-Year Plan of our country will definitely be realized, and it will definitely be realized ahead of schedule. Our goal of building a socialist society will definitely be achieved. Let us unite around the Party and Chairman Mao, and advance with unwavering confidence with the people of the whole country!

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言
    郭沫若副委员长的发言
    我们的大会听取了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”、彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”、邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”，并得到了充分讨论的机会。我们大家都感觉到我们的国家在社会主义建设上得到了很好的保证，而且通过讨论更使我们具体地全面地学习了一次马克思列宁主义的灵活运用，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    我个人是在中国科学院服务的。从科学的立场来看，我认为这些报告正是由自然科学和社会科学的丰富的和正确的知识所凝结成的马克思列宁主义的结晶。我个人不仅完全同意这些重要的报告，并愿意和全体代表一道，和全国人民一道，发扬爱国主义与国际主义的精神，厉行节约，反对浪费，为完成并超额完成这些报告中所提出的计划和任务而作全心全意的努力。
      我要特别感谢李富春副总理，他在报告中把关键性的问题之一，便是培养科学技术人材的问题，着重地提出了。李副总理说：“科学技术人材的缺乏，显然是我们前进中的一个巨大的困难。我们在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划中必须完成的重大政治任务之一，就是培养大量的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的工程技术人员，培养熟练工人，以及各方面的专门人材”。这是完全正确的。这儿所说的“各方面的专门人材”，毫无疑问，所指的也就是各项科学技术部门的比较高级的专家。
      中国的科学技术本来是有长远的光辉的历史的。全世界都知道对于近代文明作了重大贡献的三大发明——指南针、火药和印刷术，都是我们祖先的科学研究的成果。然而由于封建社会的长期停滞，更由于帝国主义的文化侵略，中国的近代科学是特别落后了。我们从国民党统治时代所接受下来的科学财产是很菲薄的，人数少，发展不平衡，有好些重要的科学在今天都依然是空白。旧有的科学知识也没有得到充分的重视，在农业、工艺和医药等方面有很丰富的旧有科学技术知识的宝藏还等待着我们去发掘、提高和推广。因此，我们在社会主义建设事业中便特别感觉到科学技术人材的非常缺乏。
    要建设社会主义社会，要使国家成为高度的现代工业化国家，没有自然科学和技术科学的雄厚基础，没有一支强大的科学队伍，是很难达到目的的。现代工业促进了科学的不断进步，而现代科学也促进了工业的不断发展，两者正交为因果。五年来我们的国家建设事业有了十分辉煌的成就，我们千切不要忘记，在这里是得到了苏联的伟大无私的帮助。苏联不仅在物质设备方面全面地系统地帮助了我们，更特别派遣了大量优秀的科学技术专家来支援我们的建设。关于这一层，李富春副总理在他的报告中已经特别提到了，他说得一点也不错：“我们在经济建设中的重要成就，是同苏联专家的帮助分不开的”。在经济建设方面是这样，在文教建设和其他建设方面也是这样。
    但我们也千切不要忘记，苏联派遣大批的专家来支援我们，并不是因为人材太多，闲着没有事做，而是从繁忙的共产主义建设的岗位上抽调出来的。要建设社会主义和共产主义，工作只有一天更比一天紧张，高级人材的需要也只有一天更比一天大量，人材过多的情况是决不会发生的。在这里我们应该特别认识到：苏联的帮助是怎样的伟大无私！但我们不能老是专一地靠着苏联的帮助，而不努力创造自己的条件。假使是那样，那我们会成为苏联的很大的包袱了。我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，是没有采取那样不争气的道路的。我们一方面在借重苏联的帮助，另一方面也正在积极地努力创造自己的条件，所以培养各方面和各等级的科学技术人材才成为“我们在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划中必须完成的重大政治任务之一”。
    目前中国的比较高级的科学人材是少得可怜的。单拿中国科学院来说，科学院有四十一个研究机构，副研究员以上的高级研究人员只有三百多位。这里面学术水平相当高的人固然不少，然而和规模宏大的国家建设事业比较起来，实在是少得可怜。因此，中国科学院正把培养新生力量作为中心工作之一。这是一项迫切的而又是长期性的任务，是丝毫也不容许我们懈怠的。大抵一个比较高级的科学人材的培养，在大学毕业以后不断地进修，起码还需要五年到十年。我们的第一个五年计划已经进行了一半了，我们希望在执行第二个五年计划或第三个五年计划的时期中，科学院所培养的新生力量能够站到建设阵地的岗位上来。
    在这里，苏联的经验给了我们极大的鼓舞。苏联在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的当时，俄罗斯科学院全部研究人员只有一百五十四人。一九二九年后开始有计划地在科学院内培养青年科学干部，到一九四一年苏联科学院的研究人员就达到了一万人，十年多的时间增加了六十四倍。目前苏联科学院的研究人员约有两万人，又比一九四一年增加了一倍。包括苏联科学院在内的全苏科学研究机构目前约有三千个，研究人员已在十万人以上。这和我们的现状是不能相比的，但这正是我们在不远的将来所必须达到而且能够达到的光辉的远景。
      但要达到这样光辉的远景，我们必须按照苏联已经为我们开辟出来的道路迈步前进。最近中国科学院召开了一次学部成立大会，依照苏联的办法，把科学院分成四个学部，即物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部和哲学社会科学部，推选了二百三十三位科学家担任学部委员，业经国务院批准。我们用这样分部具体领导的办法，准备根据社会主义建设的长远计划来规划和组织中国的科学事业，并加紧培养科学技术的新生力量。这项工作，在社会主义建设中是带有关键性的问题之一，专靠中国科学院一个机构的单独努力，我们认为是不够的。这和整个国家建设事业一样，要在党的领导下，靠着各级人民政府、各级人民代表大会和全体人民的大力支持和督导，然后才能完成任务。
    比较高级的专门人材的培养是和学校制度下的培养有所不同的。这主要是要采取带徒弟的方式来进行。不能大量生产。据一般的经验，一位专家最好是带领五、六位徒弟，太多便不能照顾。看到高级人材的培养不能大量生产，而且又多费年月，那吗可以带徒弟的专家便愈见值得我们珍惜了。能够做教学工作的人并不一定都能够进行研究工作；能够进行研究工作的人并不一定都能够带徒弟。能够带徒弟的专家，在中国目前是更加少得可怜的。因此，我们对于他们的合理使用上便更不能不特别留意了。李富春副总理在他的报告中也特别提到了“科学技术人员的合理使用问题”，他明白地指出：“任何一分技术力量的浪费，都是对国家建设的一个损失”。我们完全拥护李副总理的这个指示。在目前科学技术人材不合理使用的现象，的确是相当严重的。有好些专门人材用在行政工作方面，更有好些是所学非所用，或者可以说是专材通用。例如在目前我们正在加紧进行原子能研究的时候，我们就有几位核子物理学专家还在学校里面担任普通物理学的讲座。科学人材既少，如果不加以合理的使用，这比起“大屋顶”和“地质宫”等的豪华建筑来应该是更值得警惕的现象吧！因为这不大引人注意，而它的损失却是不容易用货币单位来折算的。因此，我们恳切地请求，在各个单位中，对于有能力从事研究的学者，能够尽可能让他们有时间进行学术研究。假使可能的话，我们更恳切地请求，能够让他们参加中国科学院的工作。这不是从一个单位的眼前利益出发来考虑问题，而是从国家的长远利益出发来考虑问题。国家的建设事业是以飞快的速度进展的，理论必须联系实际，而不断进展的实际更要求有不断进展的理论研究相联系。没有不断进展的理论研究，就是学校的教学工作也只能停顿不前，其他的建设事业不用说更会大受影响。
    国家的科学人材，我们相信，是应该而且可能统筹分配的。科学家们如果参加了科学院的工作，并不就注定了他们只是科学院的人，他们依然是国家的宝贵人材。科学院是国家的科学院。它的工作必须是为人民服务的。它必须为生产建设服务，为国防建设服务，为教学事业服务，为医疗事业服务，为一切国家建设事业服务。任何部门、任何单位，都可以合理使用它。任何部门、任何单位也都有必要扶植它，壮大它，使它在伟大的国家建设事业中能够胜任。要使科学院在国家建设事业中能够胜任，我要再说一遍，在目前集中相当的力量来培养新生力量，是刻不容缓的工作。其他任何部门的研究机构，业务虽有广狭的不同，都同样是国家的机构，也同样要以培养新生力量为中心任务。要保障国家建设，保障和平，必须有一支壮大的国防军，同时也必须有一支壮大的科学军。这一支科学队伍如果不能及时地建立起来，如果建立得不够壮大，今后的规模日益宏大的社会主义和共产主义建设计划要希望能够胜利地逐步完成，是很难令人设想的。
    当然，在目前的情况之下，我们对于科学家们也难免要提出过多的要求。人数既少，所学的本领重要，国家的需要又迫切，科学家就难免要被要求——一个人做两个人以上的工作。所谓“能者多劳”，我们相信科学家们是会感觉着应有的荣耀的。国家特别重视科学家，例如我们的全国人民代表大会的代表中，据我们不完全的统计，科学家就有一百八十四位，其中有一百零三位是中国科学院的学部委员。任务繁重，要怎样才能够把工作做得更好呢？我们相信，这是有责任感的科学家们所普遍地感受到的问题。要解决这个问题，我们认为，最好的办法还是只有加紧学习马克思列宁主义，加紧掌握辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的世界观。这样就可以给我们以正确的立场、观点和方法，提高我们的工作效率，并保卫着我们免受资产阶级唯心主义思想的侵蚀而走上错误的道路。这样的学习当然是要凭本人的志愿的，但是如果能够不断加强这样的学习志愿，那就会更好。
    马克思列宁主义是把自然现象和社会现象的发展规律替我们揭示了出来，并给予我们以进一步揭示和运用的方法，来改造自然和社会。我们学习了这个放诸四海而皆准的真理，对于自然科学和社会科学的研究和运用，自然会收到事半功倍的效果。理论可以不必多说，无可争辩的事实就是最好的证据。苏联科学是建立在马克思列宁主义的基础之上的，短短三十几年的期间便达到了科学发展的最高峰，而成为共产主义建设事业的不可缺少的榰柱。中国革命的胜利也是马克思列宁主义和中国的革命实践相结合而形成了伟大的物质力量的结果。这些无可争辩的伟大的事实，就是对于我们的具体示教。因此，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，加紧学习苏联的先进经验，这在我们目前少得可怜的科学技术工作者，就特别具有头等的必要。
    马克思列宁主义，论道理是最容易学习的东西，因为它是真实的反映。凡是真实的东西就最容易了解。年青一代的人学习马克思列宁主义，掌握得非常快，便是明证。上了年纪的人就不免要感觉着困难，那是由于我们旧有的先入之见在作怪。一个同一的空间不能容两个物品。旧的思想死死地占据着我们的脑子，没有剩下多的空间来容纳新的思想。假如在我们的朋友里面，有人对于学习马克思列宁主义感觉着冷淡和困难，我要认真地说，那就是毛病的征候了。千切不要让那种情感发展下去。那就是虎视眈眈的敌人在我们身上所要找寻的缺口。警惕吧，在我们的周围可能就有胡风，他正准备着像吸血虫一样，钻进我们的肝脏里来。我们是中华人民共和国的光荣的公民而又是国家所特别器重的科学技术工作者。我们有神圣的责任，和全国人民一道完成社会主义建设的伟大任务。我们必须肃清一切可能有的胡风，并必须赶快改造自己的思想、把我们自己身上可能有的那种缺口堵塞住！
    堵塞那种缺口有什么秘诀没有呢？
    有。那就是我们大家所知道的：“学习，学习，再学习！”
    李济深副委员长的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”和“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案”的全部内容；我建议我们大会一致通过这个计划草案，并希望我们全体代表和全国人民一致努力保证这个五年计划的实现。
    我认为这个计划完全符合宪法所规定的国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求，是实现过渡时期总任务的具体办法，反映了全中国人民建设我们伟大祖国的共同愿望和意志。只有伟大的中国共产党和毛主席才能提出这样一个伟大的计划，也只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民才能实行和完成这个伟大的计划！从过去两年多来的经验和成绩看，我和各位代表一样，对于全面完成和超额完成这个计划的各项指标，是具有坚定的信心的！在这里，我要向共产党和毛主席表示衷心感谢，同时，我们要对苏联和各人民民主国家表示衷心的感谢，特别是我们伟大邻邦苏联，它所给予我们的全面的、系统的、无私的援助，对于我们实行第一个五年计划，是有着无比重要的意义！
    我们感谢苏联，就应该学习苏联伟大的国际主义精神，学习苏联建设社会主义的先进经验，学习苏联人民万众一心、坚持不懈、为完成几个五年计划而奋斗的精神！
    我们要想把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家，就必须胜利地完成这个第一个五年计划；要想提前完成这个伟大的计划，就必须保证计划的每一项规定的具体实现。因此各有关部门或指定单位应当依照计划所规定的指标，根据自己的职责，订出有效的实行办法而切实执行。举一个小的例子，如实现农业生产计划的措施第三项之第三段所说各地方应该广泛地收集兽骨，制造骨粉，以增加肥料的供应。如果政府对于兽骨没有定出收集的具体办法，使全国屠宰场坊，特别是家家户户都能够把每天食用过的猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭等的骨头保留起来，收集起来，利用起来，那个规定就收不到最大的成果，如果定出有效的实施办法，就能够得到一宗很可观的骨粉原料。根据计划中商品流通额中所列的猪肉供应数字，把五年平均数计算每年为三○七·八万吨，如果骨头的比重，为肉量的百分之十五计算，每年可有骨头四六·一七万吨，若再加上牛、羊、鸡、鸭等的骨头约为猪骨的三分之一计算，加起来，即年有六一·五六万吨，其中若有三分之一散落人家无法收集，每年就要损失骨粉原料二○·五二万吨。我想政府计划机构和各业务部门，对于五年计划各种规定必定都会有更详细的实施办法，我这里不过指出我们应该对于计划中每一句话，都认识到它所具有的重要性，希望都能以具体办法来达到目的。我们全国六万万人民，智慧是无穷的，力量是无穷的，只要大家都动员起来，依照计划的规定，贡献出自己的力量，我们就一定能够争取提前完成这个伟大的计划！
    要想建设社会主义完成五年计划，必须反对浪费，厉行节约，以积累资金，增加财富。李富春副总理在报告中指出：“目前我们有些方面、有些部门、有些地方、有些企业，仍存在着很严重的浪费现象。”这种浪费行为是和实现五年计划的道路背道而驰的。中共中央和毛主席曾不断地指出厉行增产节约的重要意义。艰苦朴素，本是我们中国人民传统的美德。而苏联的经验更清楚地告诉我们，要建设社会主义，就必须严格地实行节约。我完全同意李富春副总理和李先念副总理在报告中所提出的关于厉行节约反对浪费的方针和办法，为了子子孙孙世世代代的幸福，我认为应该把厉行节约反对浪费作为我们全国范围长期的一个经常性的政治任务，使人人都能从思想上认识到浪费是可耻的、是犯罪的，一致起来和浪费现象展开无情的斗争！
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”。一九五五年国家预算中，经济建设费和社会文化教育费达到全年支出的百分之六○·六七，完全体现了重点建设的方针，充分反映了我们全国人民进行和平建设的愿望。但是我们知道：美帝国主义还在坚持它的“实力政策”，还在世界各处及我国的周围加紧建立军事基地，还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，为了保卫我们的社会主义建设，保卫亚洲及世界和平，反抗侵略，解放台湾，我们必须继续加强我们的国防力量。我认为今年预算中，国防费占全年支出的百分之二十四点一九，是必要的，是完全合理的。实现一九五五年的国家预算，将使我们的国民经济得到进一步的发展，人民的文化生活和物质生活将得到进一步的改善和提高，国防力量将得到进一步的加强和巩固。全国各级政府，各个部门，必须切实掌握收入和支出的每一个环节，为保证完全实现一九五五年的国家预算而奋斗！
    实行义务兵役制是我们迅速建立起强大的现代化的武装力量的一个重大步骤，并且将使我国能够逐年地积蓄起强大的预备兵员的力量。我完全同意彭德怀副总理“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”。我们知道，在兵役法修正草案公布以后，全国人民就一致表示热烈拥护，广大青年更积极响应祖国的号召，争先恐后地申请参军，如彭德怀副总理在报告中谈到的，有着无数动人的事例。我建议在大会通过了这草案成为法律以后，我们全体代表还要进行更广泛深入的宣传，使全国人民都能认识到服兵役是我们人民的光荣义务和神圣权利。
    在这次会议中，使我感到无比兴奋的更有一个根治几千年来无法治理的为患最烈的黄河的计划。这个计划的宏伟，不但在我国历史上是空前的，在世界各国也是少见的。我们古时有句话说：“圣人出而黄河清”，浑浊和为害了几千年的黄河，在这个根治计划实现以后，就将永远澄清，永远为人民造福了。这使我深刻地体会到，有了共产党和毛主席的领导，即使是有史以来从不能克服的自然灾害，我们也是能够战胜它的。
    各位代表，我在这里发言的时候，内心真有说不出的兴奋和激动，在我们面前展开着一条多么光明远大的道路，这就是通往伟大的社会主义社会的道路。我们现在是做着前人所做不到的伟大事业，我们的事业是极其光荣的，但也是十分艰巨的，同时这是我们的敌人所最不喜欢的。胡风反革命集团事件和其他反革命活动，充分说明内外敌人是在千方百计地破坏我们的事业，他们决不会甘心灭亡，所以我们必须百倍地提高警惕，防止敌人的一切破坏，并且必须严厉镇压和肃清一切反革命分子。我们民主党派要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，坚决拥护中国共产党和毛主席的领导，巩固人民民主专政，巩固统一战线，加强思想改造，批判从旧社会所带来的一切落后的和错误的思想，努力工作，贡献力量，加强反对内外敌人的斗争，和全国人民一道，为争取全面地和超额地完成第一个五年计划的伟大事业而奋斗！
    孟泰代表的发言
    我这次参加第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，我心里很愉快。
    我是一个作了三十八年工的配管工人，曾受过日本鬼子十几年的痛苦压迫。在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，一九四八年我们鞍山人民得到了解放。高炉掌握到我们工人阶级的手里，我心里真有说不出的高兴。有的日本技术人员说：“你们的高炉，不能出铁，只能长高粱”，我们下决心，一定要把高炉修复起来。当时没有工具，没有材料，我们大伙到废铁堆找零件，找材料，在党的领导下，克服了一切困难，修复了高炉。为了维护高炉，几年来我每天早去晚走检查高炉，要不亲自检查，摸一摸我们的管子，那是觉也睡不着的。
    由于党和政府的正确领导，在苏联政府帮助和苏联专家的指导以及全国人民的支援下，我们修复了旧高炉，生产有很多改进，提高了产量，还建设了很多新高炉，像八高炉、七高炉、六高炉和五高炉，这些高炉可好啦，都是自动化的。
    这次会上，我听了李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告，全国要建设那么些工厂，鞍钢要建成年产二百五十万吨生铁，三百二十二万吨钢，二百四十八万吨钢材这么一个大厂，我听了高兴极了，劲头也更大了，这真实现了我们工人阶级的希望。这次会上还听了邓子恢、彭德怀两位副总理和彭真副委员长兼秘书长的报告，对这些报告我都完全同意并热烈拥护。
    在党和政府的领导下，在苏联专家的指导和全国人民的支援下，建设鞍钢的光荣任务，我们一定能完成，而且要超额完成，我回去，准备这样干。
    第一，今年我们厂子里订了一个增产节约的竞赛计划。国家原计划我们厂里的两个高炉要大修，但经过大伙讨论，只要加强设备维护，这二个高炉今年就不要大修，就能保证高炉一时一刻都不影响生产，可以给国家多生产十一万吨生铁，另外还要增产四万吨生铁，我回去以后一定要团结群众，深入群众，完成这个竞赛计划。
    第二，我们鞍钢全体职工，一定要在今年下半年完成七千五百万元节约的任务。过去我们的管理制度不严，还有很多浪费的地方，今后我们要在工作中精打细算，厉行节约，搞好班组经济核算，降低成本。
    第三，我们一定要认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，推广先进经验，多提合理化建议。
    第四，我一定要当好人民代表，把大会的精神带回去，向职工传达，听取大家意见，向政府反映，加强同群众的联系。
    全体代表！让我们大家团结起来，互相支援，增加生产，反对浪费，厉行节约，完成党和国家交给我们的光荣任务，为完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    李大章代表的发言
      我完全同意关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案及国务院李富春副总理的报告。为着保证五年计划的贯彻执行，我现在仅就必须严惩反革命分子和坚持粮食统购统销政策两个问题，作如下的发言。
    （一）
      五年计划的实现，不仅会使我国社会主义工业建设大大发展，全部国民经济中的社会主义成份的比重大大增加，非社会主义经济成份的比重大大缩小，而且也将会使以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政和国防建设更加巩固。所有这些，都是人民的胜利，也都是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋贼卖国集团和一切敌视人民的反革命分子的失败。可是要实现五年计划，必须经过一场比过去反帝反封建更加复杂、更加尖锐和更加深刻的斗争。因为中国人民的敌人是绝不会自甘死亡的，他们是必然要千方百计地来破坏我们五年计划的。以四川的具体情况来说，四川是帝国主义及其走狗蒋贼卖国集团最后溃败的地方，他们在溃败前后潜伏下来的蒋匪特务是为数很多的。解放几年来，经过剿匪、镇反、土改等一系列社会民主改革斗争，我们曾经给了在当时进行种种破坏活动的敌人以相当沉重的打击。而这种沉重打击的结果，对于过去几年来人民生命财产安全的保障，社会秩序的树立和安定，以及对于全省经济的恢复和生产的发展上，都起了重要的保证作用。
    但在过去未遭到打击的漏网的蒋匪特务分子，在经过一度消沉之后，现在重新抬头嚣张起来。敌人当前进行破坏的目标，主要是针对我们的工业建设、互助合作运动、粮食统购统销工作，并且采取了种种卑污龌龊的手段。他们进行破坏活动的方法，主要是采取更加阴险、更加恶毒的渗透与荫蔽的斗争方式，他们常常利用我们工作中的某些薄弱环节，特别是在我们某些落后村、边远山区和少数民族地区，利用我们工作中的某些缺点与错误，或我们某些干部与工作人员在思想认识上和生活作风上的某些不健康的情况，乘机进行破坏。有的是刺探与盗窃我们的政治、经济、军事和外交情报，有的则进行暗杀、爆破、纵火、散布谣言、制造事故，甚至煽动组织暴乱。举例来讲，我省自一九五三年以来，敌人从空投和从陆路派遣进来的特务间谍，已被我破获和查明者即有五十六起。有反革命背景的流氓、盗匪等破坏社会治安的刑事案件也在增加。尤其值得注意的是敌人的破坏活动不仅发生在社会的各个方面，而且有的采取各种伪装的办法，已经混入我基本建设、工厂矿山及财经、文教等部门以及基层政权组织，甚至渗透到共产党的组织中来了。在我某些厂矿、企业和机关中，也由于组织不纯，而发生文件、电报、设计图纸及财物等被盗窃被破坏的事件是不少的。这些事实可以说明反革命分子破坏活动的严重情况。
      为什么会发生以上情况呢？我们知道，社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业在各个工作方面的不断胜利前进，必然引起一切残余反革命分子和那些即将被消灭的阶级中坚决仇视人民的分子的反抗与破坏。可是对于这一点，有的人却严重地存在着太平麻痹思想，失去革命警惕，看不到敌人的破坏活动，因而也就不能及时发现敌人，严厉地打击敌人，这显然是一种对敌情认识不足的有害的思想。此外，有的人认为地主、富农或其他反革命分子虽是反动的，但他们手无武器，因而即断定他们造不起反来的想法也是错误的。有的人对于某些反革命分子和不法地主、富农的破坏活动，主张只从思想立场上加以教育改造，或主张“重罪轻判”，而不主张按照罪情依据法律给予应得的惩处，这也显然是会助长敌人的反动气焰，而对于社会主义建设事业不利的错误思想。
    根据以上情况，为着要更好地保卫五年计划的胜利完成，我们必须时刻提高警惕，依靠千百万劳动人民，及不断加强我们的公安保卫工作，坚决同一切反革命分子的破坏活动作斗争。而且这个斗争不但在目前，而且在今后也不能有丝毫的缓和与减弱。为着彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，今后更必须紧密结合着五年计划的胜利前进而大大地加强对敌斗争。任何麻痹与疏忽，都会给敌人以破坏的可乘之机，使得我们的五年计划遭受损失。（二）
    粮食的统购统销政策，是保证国家社会主义工业化和促进农业社会主义改造的重大措施。从两年来我们执行的情况看，粮食统购统销不仅完全符合国家与农民以及全体人民的目前利益，而且更符合国家与农民以及全体人民的长远利益，因之它是完全正确而适时的，我们在今后工作中必须继续贯彻执行。
    四川是产粮区，粮食是有余裕的，同时解放后几年来不但没有大的灾情，而且每年收成都不坏。根据这一情况，四川不但不应该闹“缺粮”，而且更应该统购更多的余粮来支援国家的建设。但为什么去年温江专区发生了部分农民闹“缺粮”，今年涪陵、宜宾、达县几个专区又发生了部分农民闹
  “缺粮”呢？是不是我们对农民的余粮统购多了？或甚至买了农民应留的口粮呢？是不是我们供应少了，使得真正的缺粮户买不到口粮呢？事实证明，我们无论从全省粮食的产量数字看，或者从粮食的统购面和统购量以及给予农民“四留”的数字看，或者从粮食统销面和统销量的数字看，四川省都是不应该闹“缺粮”的。现在我们来看一看以下一些数字：一九五四年四川粮食实产量共为三百七十五亿斤，征与购合占百分之三十七（除去薯类只占粮食的百分之三十一多），平均每人征购一百六十九斤。统销量为五十六亿一千万斤，其中农村供应量为三十亿零八千五百万斤，平均每人供应五十五斤。如按缺粮户每人供应一百斤计，可供应三千零八十五万人，占农业总人口的百分之五十五多。农村缺粮户和“转转户”全省平均最高以占总农户的百分之四十五（一般占百分之三十至四十）计，每人供应的口粮和周转粮以一百斤计，全年农村共需供应量为二十五亿一千多万斤，较目前实际供应量可减少近五亿七千万斤，足见农村粮食供应漏洞是很多的，浪费是很大的。城市粮食供应情况也同样是漏洞多而浪费大。全省二千人以上的城镇的人口共约六百万人，共供应了二十五亿二千五百万斤，平均每人每月供应三十四点五斤，这个供应数字是大的。如果供应的更恰当合理，要求城市销量按人口每人每天节约一两米，以六百万城镇人口计，全年即可节约一亿三千四百多万斤。就是在每人每天节约了一两粮食后的供应标准，也仍然是比较高的。
    但即是根据以上的情况，而城乡仍然有人在闹
  “缺粮”的原因何在呢？其中原因的一方面，固然有的是由于我们工作有缺点，如在统购评产中，由于对产量的调查不够确实，因而对个别农户发生了偏高偏低的现象，或在供应时，该供应的未供应，不该供应的反而供应了等等。另一方面，是反映了集体与个体、社会主义的计划经济与小农经济之间的矛盾。这是闹“缺粮”问题的本质的一面。而且更毒辣阴险的是某些不法地主、富农和残余反革命分子利用以上矛盾和我们工作中的某些缺点进行造谣挑拨，煽惑群众对于统购统销政策的不满，这更是绝对不能容许的犯罪行为。正是由于以上种种原因，因此我们对于农民的闹“缺粮”问题得出了两条规律，即第一，凡是闹“缺粮”闹得愈凶的人，实际上不但不缺粮，而且有余粮。或者有的农民在喊叫“缺粮”，实际缺的是大米，并不缺小麦、苞谷、薯类等食物。第二，凡是不认真加强对农民的教育和加强对粮食供应的管理工作，以及坚决惩处某些不法地主、富农和残余反革命分子的乘机破坏，而只是采取谁喊叫即供应谁的官僚主义办法，其结果是供应的愈多，闹得也就越厉害。关于以上情况，我们有不少干部不从问题发生的本质方面去加以分析区别，反而同情或跟着叫，这不仅是反映了部分落后农民的呼声，而且更有人在听了喊叫之后，便主观地认为政府是否对农民的粮食统购多了，供应少了，或者认为粮食的统购统销政策虽是正确的，但由于某些干部在执行政策上有偏差，对农民的困难照顾太少了。这实际就是说共产党与人民政府都不能代表农民利益，而他反是代表农民利益的了。这种观点与论调，显然是不符合于实际情 况，不符合于统购统销政策，不符合于农民最根本的社会主义利益的。实际是企图推迟或者是不要我们国家社会主义工业化的一种错误思想。
    为着使得我们的粮食供应工作做得更好，以便能节约更多的粮食来支援国家需要，保证五年计划的胜利完成，我们必须继续批判与克服对于粮食统购统销工作的某些错误作法与错误想法，并认真地整顿统销工作，特别是我们更应全面地贯彻“三定”政策，使得农民生产情绪能够获得进一步的稳定与提高。对于城市人口的粮食供应问题，也必须进一步迅速而有计划有步骤地加以调整，使城乡粮食的供应，都能获得更公平合理的解决，这对于巩固工农联盟，支援国家建设是有重大意义的。
    刘伯承代表的发言
    在这次会议上听到了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，李先念副总理
  “关于一九五四年国家决算和一九五五年国家预算的报告”和邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”。这些报告都是为我们自己和子孙谋幸福事业的报告。正如毛泽东主席所说的：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”从这些报告中我们看到了祖国逐步走向社会主义的光明而壮丽的前景。这正是中国共产党领导我们人民大众奋斗所追求的目的。我在此表示衷心的拥护。
    同时应看到正当我国从事于和平劳动建设社会主义的时候，美国帝国主义侵略集团却在千方百计地阻挠着我国人民解放自己的领土台湾，并且准备用新的大规模侵略战争和叫嚣使用原子武器威胁我国的安全和威胁全人类。我们武装力量的任务就是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权领土完整和安全。我们尤应提高警惕，在集中力量建设社会主义的同时，必须增强保卫社会主义的国防力量，以保卫我国独立和世界和平。
    这次大会在审定第一个五年计划、国家决算预算和开发黄河水利的规划的同时，又审定我国兵役法，使社会主义经济建设与保卫社会主义国防建设获得结合实施。彭德怀副总理兼国防部长关于兵役法草案的报告，我完全拥护并请求大会通过予以实施。
    中华人民共和国宪法第十六条规定：“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情。”第一百零三条又规定：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务。”从这里可以看到我们每一个公民能光荣地建设社会主义，又能光荣地保卫社会主义，使生产劳动与保卫祖国相结合。在中国的古代即有“寓兵于农”的说法。在抗日战争中我们各解放区除常有兵力作战之外，劳动人民也曾一面进行生产劳动，一面手持武器保卫祖国。在现在正在进行的五年计划中，有工业的建设，也有农业的建设，也有科学技术的建设，那我们除现役外，即是“寓兵于工”“寓兵于农”和“寓兵于学”。如此就可以集中较多的人力物力财力进行社会主义经济建设。同时也积蓄了国防力量，以适应战时国防的需要。按照兵役法规定我们既有现役又有预备役，这不但有现役的基干兵力，而且可以层层积蓄了预备兵力，同时兵役法还规定了平时的入役、退役，战时的动员，战后的复员，井井有序，更能够以生产劳动与保卫祖国相结合。这的确是一个很好的兵役法。
    由于原子武器和喷气武器的出现，军事科学有了新的发展。预料今后的战争，将是由陆军、海军、空军、空降兵、防空兵在地面上在海洋里在天空中综合进行的。战线的宽广，兵力的众多，物资的消耗都将较以前为大。有了国家工业化，国防现代化才有了物质基础；有了现代化的国防，国家工业化才有了保障。现在美帝国主义极力武装蒋贼，
  一方面进行军事扰乱，一方面进行政治阴谋。我们对于帝国主义侵略集团发动新的战争的阴谋，必须具有高度的警惕，必须警惕帝国主义发动战争的突然性，因而必须在物质上在精神上有所准备。我们热爱和平，但是我们也不惧怕战争。如果帝国主义敢于发动侵略我国的战争，我们坚信，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，久经锻炼的中国人民，有充分的能力击败帝国主义的侵略，保卫国家的安全和领土的完整。
      在一九五四年度按照义务兵役制的原则进行试征时，全国公民特别是广大青年们曾在我们宣传解释之后，即用实际行动热烈拥护义务兵役制的执行。他们说义务兵役制很好，在执行之时：一、不误国防，二、不误生产，三、不误青年的生活前途。广大青年们非常清楚地认识到建设社会主义是自己光荣的事情，服兵役就是为了保卫祖国社会主义建设的神圣职责。虽然尚有一些反革命分子进行造谣、暗杀、烧山、阻挠等破坏活动，而报名的人数仍达一千万以上。这些事实却超出了某些人意想之外。
      在彭德怀副总理兼国防部长在这次会议上作了
  “关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”后，根据七月十八日人民日报的报道，北京的工人、农民、学生首先对义务兵役制的实施是热烈拥护的。根据去年试行义务兵役制证实，只要在人民群众中进行深入的宣传教育，义务兵役制的实施，必能取得广大人民群众的热烈拥护。
    军官的来源，一方面靠军队内部培养，一方面靠军队外面培养，高等学校的培养尤为重要。对于预备役军官必须很好地进行登记并组织集训。几年来有不少的富有战斗经验的现役军人，复员后转到各种建设工作上去，这是我们的很好的军官，必须组织起来。
    关于训练准备问题：军事训练的方针和内容，应根据所服兵役种类的不同和各人的职业不同而有所不同。预备役人员有的在工业部门工作，有的在农业部门中工作，有的在交通运输部门中工作，有的在通信部门中工作，这些都应根据军队的需要与他的业务关系相结合进行训练，也就是说，应该做到生产技术训练和保卫国防训练相结合，军外训练与军内训练相结合即速成训练与完成训练相结合，使用兵器训练与军队指挥训练相结合，政治训练和军事训练相结合。关于训练实施问题应该由相关的主管部门组织进行。
    国家机关和国民经济各部门，平时在建设中即应着眼于将来如何为保卫祖国的战争服务，只有这样，才有可能在一旦遭到帝国主义发动侵略战争的袭击时，能把全国政治经济文化组织都纳入战时轨道，适合战时的要求。
    人民解放军的现役军人，应加紧军事训练和政治学习，百倍提高警惕，严守海防、陆防、空防，以保卫发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的实施。
    陈永康代表的发言
    听了李富春和李先念两位副总理关于五年计划和国家预决算的报告后，我感到非常的兴奋，并衷心地拥护。
    五年计划是为了在我国实现社会主义工业化的一个伟大计划。这个计划的实现，将使国家逐步走向富强，人民逐步走向幸福。
    在实现五年计划的斗争中，我们农民的责任，就是要大力发展农业生产，积极支援国家工业建设，保证农业增产计划的完成。
    要增加农业生产，就一定要走农业合作化的道路。因为，只有组织起来，才能合理地组织劳动力，合理地使用土地，有步骤地提高耕种技术，降低农业生产的成本，减轻天灾的损失，增加农民的收入。就以我们的联民农业生产合作社来说，虽然是去年春天刚建立起来的一个新社，去年夏秋又遭到严重的水涝、虫害；但由于组织起来的优越条件，不但战胜了灾害，而且获得了丰收。一九五四年社的水稻平均产量，仍达到六百零八斤，比一九五三年提高百分之七，比周围互助组的产量高出百分之八点六，比单干农户的产量高出百分之十点六。
    有人说，合作社产量所以比单干农户高，完全是靠了政府对合作社的支持。别的社我不知道，以我们社来说，这是不合事实的。政府对我们社的帮助固然很大，但主要的方面，还是要靠我们自己努力劳动，发挥合作社的各种优越性。顺便说一句，合作社是农业的社会主义改造的方向，政府支持合作社也是应该的。又有人说，合作社一切都好，就是歧视单干户不好。以我们的社来说，这也不合事实。我们的社，在浸种、换种、排水、修圩、介绍先进的耕作技术等各方面，都十分注意帮助或带动周围的单干户去做。当然，如果合作社有歧视单干户的情形，是不好的，应当纠正过来。
    我认为我国第一个五年计划是很好的，是完全能够办得到的。计划中规定粮食计划产量，五年内增长百分之十七点六，就我社的生产情况来看，这个指标，完全有把握超额完成。我省的水稻计划产量，五年内将增长百分之三十。即由一九五二年每亩平均产量五百四十五斤，到一九五七年达到每亩平均产量七百一十斤。为了保证完成以上这个水稻增产的指标，我们采取以下几项主要办法：（一）在栽培技术方面，普遍采用“落谷稀”、小株密植等办法。采用“落谷稀”办法的好处是，可使秧活得快，长得壮。俗语说：“秧好半年稻”。秧长得健壮，收成就有了一半希望。同时每亩田还可以节省三斤到四斤稻种。采用小株密植的办法，可使每亩田由过去一万四千棵，增加到一万八千棵到二万棵；由于栽植均匀，就使土地、肥料等得到更合理地使用，日照也更加充足。这样就可使每亩产量增加五十斤左右。（二）加强田间管理工作，除草是很重要的一件农事。除草就好像镇压反革命一样，必须搞得彻底，干净。有人主张除草要做到“三耥三耘”，其实除草不在次数多少，而主要的是要搞得彻底。如果次数搞多了，而搞得不彻底，反而会伤害到稻棵的生长。（三）在增施肥料和合理灌溉方面，我们打算在社内拨出一部分土地，种植红花草、蔬菜、蕃瓜、红薯等作物，以解决养猪的饲料，增积足够的厩肥和绿肥。去年我们还搞了两千多担水草，一百九十五担野草，捉了一万七千多斤蟚蛴，解决了四百多亩田的追肥，开了二十多条河浜，挑了河泥，解决了一百多亩田的基肥。我们计划采取以上这些办法，做到以厩肥解决全部肥料的三分之二左右，以绿肥和磷肥解决全部肥料的三分之一左右。肥料对于增产是很重要的，但也要使用得当。施肥和灌溉用水，就像人们饮食一样，既不可不饮不食，也不可暴饮暴食。有人以为肥料施得多，就可增产，这意见不全对。如果肥料施得太多，好像饭吃得太饱，不仅无益，反而有害。也有人以为肥料施得少，就会减产，这意见也不全对。如果肥料少，而能注意在作物长壮、分蘖、结实的紧要关头，适时适量使用，稻谷仍会长得好。作物灌溉用水的深浅适当与否，对作物的生长，关系同样很大。（四）选种、留种和品种改良方面，我们不但要求选留足够的种子，而且要求采用精选办法，使种子纯度达到百分之九十八以上；同时，减少社内早稻、糯稻的种植面积，变低产为高产。（五）防虫、防涝、防旱，与农业增产的关系很大，特别是防治螟害尤为重要。我们计划通过秧田捕蛾、采卵与本田治螟，使螟害率逐步下降。由于组织起来在各方面所显示的优越性，再加上以上农业增产的各项办法，我们是有充分信心和决心，保证完成和超额完成国家农业增产的计划。
    最后，农业合作化是同统购统销分不开的，两年来，我们农民深深体会到：只有实行粮食统购统销，物价才能稳定，我们才不会再受富农和奸商的剥削，农村才不会再走过去的老路，农民生产情绪才高，合作社才能更加巩固。但是有些人好像是在为我们农民讲话，他们故意歪曲事实，颠倒是非，说下面统购统销搞得如何糟糕，农民的生活又怎样的苦等等，实际上他们是在反对社会主义。我们农民清楚地知道，我们过去在共产党的领导下进行土改，得到翻身，现在只有继续在共产党的领导下，坚决走合作化的道路，才能走向社会主义的幸福的光明大道。我们更要百倍提高警惕，坚决防止和肃清反革命的破坏，只有这样，才能保证社会主义在我国的胜利。
    李烛尘代表的发言
    第一个五年计划是一个引导我国向工业化的社会主义社会的目标前进，并使我国繁荣富强和人民幸福的伟大的计划。我热烈地拥护这个计划，我们私营工商业者应该正确地发挥我们在五年计划中的应有作用，对五年计划作出一定的贡献，和全国人民一道，为全部实现这个计划而奋斗。
    首先，私营工商业者要从社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的迅速进展中，看清楚自己今后努力的方向。第一个五年计划是在国民经济已经恢复的基础上开始实行的，也是根据我国过渡时期总任务的要求而制定的，两年来，在各个方面已取得了辉煌的成就。对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造是第一个五年计划一个必要的组成部分。中华人民共和国成立以来，共产党和人民政府对资本主义工商业正确地执行了利用、限制和改造的政策，在对资本主义工商业逐步实行社会主义改造方面积累了许多宝贵经验。私营工商业者几年来在共产党和人民政府的领导和教育下，不少人的思想觉悟有所提高，逐步懂得社会主义与资本主义这两种对立的生产关系，在一个国家里互不干扰地平行发展是不可能的，走社会主义的路，是我国历史发展的必然规律。但是，进行社会主义改造应该在社会主义经济的领导下，按照当前的实际情况，采取切实可行的办法，逐步地实现。因此，在我国目前的政治和经济的具体条件下，五年内资本主义工商业将经过公私合营、加工订货、代销经销等等方式将资本主义工商业逐步纳入国家资本主义的轨道，为私营工商业的社会主义改造建立基础是必要的也是可能的。第一个五年计划细密地安排了对资本主义工商业改造的工作，同时要求资本家必须遵守国家法律，接受改造。私营工商业者应当很好地体会它的精神和实质，服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，遵守国家计划，接受工人群众的监督，老老实实地通过各种形式的国家资本主义，积极接受社会主义改造，这样才能符合国家和广大人民对我们的期待。我们私营工商业者朝着这个方向努力是光荣的，前途也是光明的，我们应当为之欢欣鼓舞。
    其次，私营工商业者要努力发挥生产经营上的积极性，以实际行动来响应政府统筹安排的措施。自从政府对私营工商业采取全业安排、按业改造的政策措施以后，私营工商业者大多数都以感激的心情来积极搞好生产经营。但是有的私营工商业者对于安排与改造相结合的政策认识不足，强调照顾的一面，忽视改造的一面；或者强调一视同仁的一面，忽视有所不同的一面；或者强调局部困难的一面，忽视照顾全局的一面；因而存在着“原料靠国家、资金靠银行、生产靠工人、市场靠国营。”或者“国营单做批发，私商专搞零售，分工合作，各得其所”等错误的想法。必须指出：这些错误的想法对社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业都是有害的。私营工商业者应该理解社会主义建设和社会主义改造是一个艰苦奋斗的过程。在社会主义改造过程中，私营工商业在生产上和经营上遇着某些困难是难于完全避免的，但这是一时的，局部的，可以克服的困难。在某些困难克服了以后，还会不断地出现一些新的困难。如果我们不发挥主动性和积极性，单纯依赖政府，或忽视国营经济的困难，过多地要求照顾，有些本来可以自己解决的问题也不努力去解决，那就会增加困难的程度和克服困难的障碍。于国于己都是不利的。因此我们要树立信心，纠正消极依赖思想，在国家的统筹兼顾的方针下，努力克服困难，积极整顿企业、改善经营管理，积极响应政府统筹安排的措施。
    第三，私营工商业者要增加生产、厉行节约，进一步推动企业的改造。私营工商业既然是国民经济的一个组成部分，而且大部分在国营经济领导下，已经纳入国家资本主义轨道，都有责任在第一个五年计划期间贡献一定的力量。私营工业通过增产节约运动，不但可以做到按时、按质、按量完成国家委托的任务，而且可以节约原材料，提高产品质量，降低工缴费用，同时，可以推动企业经营管理的改善和生产技术的改进，为公私合营创造条件。私营商业认真开展节约运动，也可以改善经营管理，节省开支费用，扩大商品流转，更好地为消费者服务。最重要的，私营工商业者在增产节约运动中，可以学习更多的新事物，来代替某些资本主义的经营方法和作风。这样做，不但运动本身就是一种生动的、内容极其丰富的实际教育，而且施行结果，也可对国家经济建设的资金积累，作出一定的贡献。还有，我们要在公债工作中，积极完成缴款入库任务，这是支援国家经济建设的实际行动。
    第四，私营工商业者要提高政治觉悟，结合企业改造来认真进行个人的思想改造。今天私营工商业者在国民经济中可以起有利的作用，而在政治上也有一定的地位，有了政治地位，就有政治责任。我们知道个人改造的最后目的是成为社会主义社会的公民，就应该放远眼光，虚心学习，来提高我们的政治觉悟和思想认识。私营工商业者要克服只顾个人不顾社会、只顾眼前不顾将来、只顾个人消费不顾社会生产的观点和行为，同那些破坏生产、抽逃资金、暗害工人、散布各种反动谣言的抗拒改造的坏分子作坚决的斗争。私营工商业者不应回避和害怕改造，相反的，应当勇于参加到接受改造的光荣行列中来。特别对于坚决肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，正是我们当前的政治考验，私营工商业者决不能也不应漠不关心，置身事外，而要认真学习文件，积极投入斗争，并应该纠正自己的缺点，堵塞漏洞，严防一切暗藏的反革命分子的破坏活动。我们应该提高爱国主义精神，激发革命热情，进一步清除敌我不分的思想，进一步提高政治警惕性和政治责任感，一致声讨胡风反革命集团，清除各种暗藏的反革命分子，为坚决保卫我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
    全国私营工商业者们！毛泽东主席说：“我们正在做我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。有伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导我们，在保证发展重工业为中心的不可动摇的基础上，我国的第一个五年计划一定能够实现，一定能够提前实现，我们建设社会主义社会的目的一定能够达到，让我们团结在党和毛主席周围，同全国人民一道，信心百倍地奋勇前进吧！
