    Chongqing's 2,269 collective catering units have been paying attention to saving grain. Since the second quarter, the amount of grain used by each catering unit each month has been decreasing. According to statistics from more than 860 catering units in the central district of the city, grain consumption in June decreased by 155,000 jin compared to May.

    Since the implementation of the grain budgeting system for government agencies and organizations in April, the food administrators and cooks of many units have improved the food management system and implemented a meal registration system. The No. 7 Intermediate Party School of the CPC Central Committee and the Fifth Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau have conscientiously formulated and implemented grain conservation plans. Now, the average monthly consumption per person has decreased by two to three jin compared to the original grain consumption. In the past, people generally believed that wasting grain in medical units was unavoidable. In the campaign against wasting grain, many hospitals and sanatoriums have adopted the method of "frequent asking, frequent running, and frequent adding" for patient meals, and the phenomenon of wasting grain casually has been greatly reduced. In late June, most catering units checked their grain inventory, and some units have abolished unreasonable small grain depots.

    The actions of Chongqing's collective catering units to overcome grain waste have attracted the attention of nearby farmers. Chongqing University received a letter of praise from members of the Huohua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qijiang County for saving grain. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆各机关团体约节用粮
    重庆市二千二百六十九个集体伙食单位注意节约粮食，自第二季度以来，各伙食单位每月的用粮数都在下降。据市中心区的八百六十多个伙食单位统计，六月份用粮比五月份减少了十五万五千斤。
    自四月份实行机关、团体用粮预决算制度后，许多单位的伙食管理员和炊事员健全了伙食管理制度，实行用膳登记办法。中共中央第七中级党校和市公安局五分局认真制定和执行节约粮食计划，现在每人每月的平均消费量比原来用粮数要下降二斤到三斤。过去一般人认为医疗单位浪费粮食是不可避免的。在反对浪费粮食中，许多医院、疗养院对病人用膳采取了“勤问、勤跑、勤添”的办法，随便浪费粮食的现象已大大减少。六月下旬大部分伙食单位都检查了粮食库存情况，有些单位已把不合理的小粮库废除了。
    重庆市各集体伙食单位克服粮食浪费的行动，引起了附近农民的注意。重庆大学由于节约粮食，曾收到綦江县火花农业生产合作社社员们来信表扬。　（新华社）
