　　Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble Visits and Sees Performances in Beijing

　　(Our newspaper reports) On the morning of August 8th, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble visited the Palace Museum.

　　The honored guests were very interested in every piece of art and craft exhibited in the museum. They asked detailed questions, and many took notes. Ekchulu said: "The Chinese working people are truly great! They created so many exquisite works of art very early on." The honored guests also visited the "Exhibition Against the U.S. Aggressor Group's Conspiracy to Plunder Cultural Relics in Taiwan." When they learned that the U.S. aggressors had looted famous murals, sculptures, and Buddha heads from many Buddhist grottoes in our country, they were very indignant. The International Friendship Museum displays many gifts given to our country by the Mongolian People's Republic. The honored guests smiled happily when they saw the gifts from their own country. Yideqin pointed to a plaster statue and said to a Chinese friend: "This is a statue of Comrade Choibalsan's mother." The Mongolian friends were attracted by the ivory carvings of Guangxi scenery and dragon boats in the museum, watching for a long time, reluctant to leave. When they heard Chinese friends say that the long chain on the ivory carved gourd was carved from the part of the ivory inside the gourd, they repeatedly praised in Chinese: "Good! Good! Good!" After the visit, Qilindaoerji said excitedly: "After visiting these crafts, we have seen the great wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people. These rich and excellent cultural heritages were only enjoyed by a few emperors in the past, but after years of struggle by the Chinese people, they have finally been returned to the working people. We are very happy to be able to see so many cultural heritages today."

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China held a Peking opera soiree on the evening of the 8th to entertain the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble headed by Major General Damdinhor.

　　At the soiree, famous Peking opera actors Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and others performed "Luoshen," and actors from the China Peking Opera Theatre performed the classical dance drama "Yandang Mountain" and the dance drama "Qiujiang." The performances of the Chinese dramatists won many warm applauses. After the performance, members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army Song and Dance Ensemble presented flowers to Mei Lanfang and others to thank them for their wonderful performances tonight.

　　On the evening of the 5th, the Mongolian artists watched the performance of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The classical song and dance drama "Nao Long Gong" and song and dance programs performed at the soiree were appreciated by the Mongolian artists.

　　蒙古人民革命军歌舞团在京参观和观剧
    本报讯　八日上午，蒙古人民革命军歌舞团参观了故宫博物院。
    贵宾们对博物院里陈列的每一件美术工艺品都很感兴趣。他们详细询问后，很多人都记了笔记。额楚鲁说：“中国劳动人民真伟大！很早很早就创造了这么多精美的艺术品。”贵宾们还参观了“反对美国侵略集团阴谋劫夺在台湾文物展览”，当他们了解到美国侵略者把我国许多佛教石窟里的著名壁画、塑像、佛头劫走时，非常愤慨。国际友谊馆里陈列着蒙古人民共和国送给我国的不少礼品。贵宾们看见自己国家的礼品都高兴地笑了。义德钦好指着一个石膏像，对中国朋友说：“这是乔巴山同志的母亲的塑像。”蒙古朋友被博物院里的象牙雕刻的广西风景画和龙舟吸引住了，看了很久，不愿离开。当他们听到中国朋友说，那个象牙镂雕的葫芦上的一长串链子是用葫芦里面那部分象牙雕刻出来的时候，连用中国话称赞说：“好！好！好！”齐林道尔吉参观后兴奋地说：“参观了这些工艺品，我们看到了中国劳动人民伟大的智慧和创造力。这许多丰富的优秀的文化遗产，过去只供少数的帝王享受，经过中国人民多年的斗争，现在终于归还劳动人民了。今天我们能看到这许多文化遗产，觉得非常愉快。”
