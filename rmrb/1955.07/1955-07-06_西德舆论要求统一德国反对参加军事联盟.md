Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 5th (TASS dispatch): Following the Soviet government's note to West Germany, the movement opposing the arming of West Germany and striving to establish a unified Germany that does not participate in military alliances is growing in West Germany.

Former German General Staff Colonel Boning pointed out at the Social Democratic Party conference in Munich that relying on a policy of "strength" will never restore German unity. He said that an extremely important prerequisite for restoring German unity is to change West Germany's attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and abandon the policy of arming West Germany. Boning believes that there is no better path than establishing a unified Germany that does not participate in any alliances.

Well-known West German social figure Mohalski wrote in the magazine "German Voice": "Normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will bring into question the military utilization of West Germany." He said that the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany may give Germany what Western countries have so far refused to give for military reasons, namely: the restoration of unity and Germany's freedom and security in a European collective security system. He then pointed out that if this were the case, German divisions belonging to the North Atlantic group and commanded by the United States would be unnecessary.

There are many similar opinions advocating that a unified Germany should maintain neutrality. The West German "League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom" has long put forward this demand. West German Social Democratic leaders often come very close to this view in practice, and ordinary party members even more so.

West German and West Berlin newspapers reflect public opinion against West Germany's remilitarization and against dragging West Germany into military blocs, because this is the main obstacle to German reunification. The "Westphalian Review" criticized the West German government for hastily building up its military, which is detrimental to the solution of the German question. The "Nuremberg News" said that the Soviet proposal cannot be rejected casually. The "Frankfurter Neue Presse" pointed out that an atomic war would first destroy West Germany, and believes that "the demand for disarmament is of great significance." The "Fulda People's News" demanded the removal of all military bases from German territory and the withdrawal of foreign troops. The vast majority of newspapers advocated the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, and supported Adenauer going to Moscow for direct negotiations. The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" said: Adenauer's visit "should not impose any conditions."

　　西德舆论要求统一德国反对参加军事联盟
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社柏林四日讯：在苏联致西德政府照会发表以后，反对武装西德和争取建立一个不参加军事联盟的统一的德国的运动在西德日益高涨。
    前德国总参谋部上校波宁在慕尼黑的社会民主党代表会议上指出，依靠“实力”政策决不能使德国恢复统一。他说，恢复德国统一的极重要前提是改变西德对北大西洋公约组织的态度和放弃武装西德的政策。波宁认为，除了建立一个不参加任何联盟的统一的德国以外，找不出更好的道路。
    西德著名社会人士莫哈尔斯基在“德意志之声”杂志上写道：“苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间关系正常化，将使在军事上利用西德一事发生问题。”他说，苏联同西德建立正常关系可能给予德国以西方国家由于军事理由至今拒绝给予的东西，这就是：恢复统一以及德国在欧洲集体安全体系中的自由和安全。他接着指出，如果这样，属于北大西洋集团、由美国统帅指挥的德国师就没有任何必要了。
    类似的主张统一的德国保持中立的意见还很多。西德“德国人争取统一、和平和自由联盟”早就提出了这种要求。西德社会民主党领袖实际上也往往十分接近这种主张，这个党的普通党员就更其如此。
    西德和西柏林报纸反映出舆论反对西德重新军国主义化，反对把西德拉入军事集团，因为这是统一德国的主要障碍。“威斯特伐利亚评论”斥责西德政府急于建立军队使德国问题的解决遭受损害。“纽伦堡新闻”说，苏联的建议不能随便拒绝。“法兰克福新报”指出，原子战争首先将使西德遭到灭亡，并认为，“裁减军备的要求是具有极大的意义的”。“孚尔达人民新闻”要求撤除德国领土上的一切军事基地，撤退外国军队。绝大多数报纸主张建立苏联和西德之间的外交、经济和文化关系，赞成阿登纳到莫斯科去直接谈判。“南德意志报”说：阿登纳这次访问“不应提出任何条件”。
