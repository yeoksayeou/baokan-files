　　A Geological Exploration Team in Xikang
　　Chen Xueyu
    In the vast lands of southeastern Xikang in our motherland, areas that were once barren and uninhabited are now home to a large geological exploration team, searching for underground treasures for the nation. This is the 508 Exploration Team of the Southwest Geological Bureau. This team possesses geology, surveying, drilling, trenching, shallow well, geophysical prospecting, and field laboratory capabilities, as well as various new types of exploration equipment and a repair shop dedicated to servicing drilling rigs.
    The 508 Exploration Team arrived in Xikang in June 1954. Based on existing clues, they conducted general surveys and detailed investigations in this vast area. With the strong assistance of local ethnic groups, they finally discovered a large copper mine and iron mine. At the same time, they also found gold, silver, phosphorus, coal, lead, zinc, asbestos, and other mineral deposits, fully proving that this is a rich polymetallic region. This year, they are continuing to expand the scope of the general survey while conducting exploration to further clarify the extension, reserves, and grade changes of these mineral bodies, providing the country with reliable mineral resource data.
    This spring, preparations for exploration began. Convoys of vehicles transported drilling rigs, water pipes, and various construction materials from afar. Drilling rig installation workers, construction workers, engineering technicians, and laborers launched large-scale construction in the mining area. At the construction site, the ranks of builders, like a torrent of rushing water, ceaselessly attacked the barren mountains day and night. In less than half a year, rows of new houses and drilling towers appeared in places that were originally overgrown with weeds; a wide and flat road wound its way into the mountains from the rugged cliffs.
    Now, exploration work in the mining area has fully unfolded. The latest drilling machines from the Soviet Union and our country have been put into operation in large numbers. When people come here, they will see many triangular drilling sheds appearing on the undulating mountains; the buzzing of motors echoes from inside the sheds, reverberating throughout the vast wilderness. Surveying flags are everywhere on the slopes; many slender and clean water pipes, like countless long snakes, wind their way from deep ditch ponds to every mountain peak. Rows of utility poles line the mountains, weaving the entire mine into a dense spider web. Countless people, carrying sledgehammers and instruments, run around every mountain all day long. At night, the light of carbide lamps illuminates each triangular shed, making it transparent, and the songs of labor continue day and night.
    In this exploration team, there are senior geological workers, students who have just graduated from school, hardworking and brave drilling workers, and demobilized soldiers dedicated to construction. Although they come from various different regions and different positions, everyone has a common goal: to establish a strong industrial base in the many blank areas of southwest China.

　　一支地质勘探队在西康
　　陈学愚
    在祖国西康东南部的大片土地上，从前是荒芜无人的地方，现在出现了一支庞大的地质勘探队，正在为国家探寻地下宝藏。这就是西南地质局五○八勘探队。这支勘探队拥有地质、测量、钻探、槽探、浅井、地球物理探矿和野外化验室等工种，还有各种新型的勘探设备和专为钻机服务的修配车间。
    五○八勘探队是一九五四年六月来到西康的。他们根据已经有的线索，在这片辽阔的地区内进行了普查和详查，在当地各民族同胞的大力协助下，终于找到了一个很大的铜矿和铁矿，同时还发现了金、银、磷、煤、铅、锌、石棉等矿藏，完全证明了这里是一个富饶的多金属地区。今年，他们一面继续扩大普查范围，一面进行勘探，以便进一步弄清这些矿体的延伸、储量和品位变化，为国家提供可靠的矿藏资料。
    今年春天，勘探前的准备工作开始了。成群的汽车，从遥远的地方运来了钻机、水管和各种建筑器材；钻机安装工人、建筑工人、工程技术人员和民工，在矿区内展开了大规模的建设。工地上，建设者的队伍，像一股奔腾的巨流，日夜不停地向荒山进攻。不到半年的时间，原来那些荒草丛生的地方，就出现了一排一排的新房和钻塔；一条宽阔平坦的公路，从崎岖的山崖间蜿蜒伸入矿山。
    现在，矿区内的勘探工作已经全面展开了。来自苏联和我国最新出品的钻探机已经大批地开动起来。当人们来到这里的时候，就会看到在那绵延起伏的大小山头上，出现了许多三角形的钻探棚子；棚子里发出了嗡嗡的马达声，响彻了辽阔的原野。山坡上，到处是勘测队的旗子；许多细长而洁白的水管，像无数条长蛇，从深沟水池中，蜿蜒爬上每个山峰。山上的电线杆子排成行，把整个矿山织成一个密密的蛛网。无数的人群，扛着鎯头、背着仪器，成天地奔跑在每个山头。入夜，汽灯光把每个三角棚子照得透明，劳动的歌声昼夜不停。
    在这支勘探队里，有年老的地质工作者，有刚从学校毕业的学生，有勤劳而勇敢的钻探工人，还有复员建设军人。虽然他们都来自各个不同的地区和不同的岗位，但大家都有一个共同的目标：在祖国西南的许多空白地区上，建立起强大的工业基地。
